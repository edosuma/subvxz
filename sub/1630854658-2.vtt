01:09.277 --> 01:12.697
SUMMER OF 2012

01:14.032 --> 01:15.116
KOO SEONG-HEE

01:17.660 --> 01:19.120
SON MYEONG-O

01:21.498 --> 01:22.832
MORE TATTOOS? I'M SO COOL

01:22.916 --> 01:24.334
LEE SA-RA

01:24.417 --> 01:25.835
FINISHED MY PAINTING. CHEERS!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.337
WHAT TO WEAR? SO MANY CLOTHES

01:41.226 --> 01:42.393
You spying?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.396
Those IVs help you paint?

01:45.480 --> 01:48.024
What's in them
makes you a little more obedient.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.154
Five hundred grams.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.656
Careful with it.

01:54.739 --> 01:58.493
Well, God,
we thank thee for this daily bread.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.373
Five hundred grams. Bullshit, you asshole.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.667
Don't stiff me
on my source of inspiration.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.710
You're not an artist, you're a stoner.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.840
Gonna use that thing in your hair
to draw the Mona Lisa?

02:11.923 --> 02:14.175
The Mona Lisa's
the only art you know, right?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.552
Of course it is, dumbass.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.890
I'll let this one slide
because you're just such a little puppy.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.151
Ah, Jesus, she's such a fucking bitch.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.486
CHOI HYE-JEONG

02:39.492 --> 02:40.702
JEON JAE-JUN

02:40.785 --> 02:42.245
FIVE DAYS AGO

02:42.328 --> 02:43.621
SIESTA

02:53.631 --> 02:55.216
Do you need anything, sir?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.971
Why don't you sing me a lullaby?

03:00.054 --> 03:01.389
I can't sleep.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
Would you like me
to get you a warm wet towel set?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.311
I'd like something else
that's warm and wet.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.277
Calm down and sleep tight.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.654
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:21.075
<i>to ensure a safe flight, use of any</i>
<i>electronic devices is not allowed.</i>

03:23.494 --> 03:26.497
<i>I'm so tired.</i>
<i>Can you give me a ride?</i>

03:26.581 --> 03:28.416
NEW MESSAGE
JAE-JUN

03:42.889 --> 03:45.433
<i>Drink a Bacchus</i>
<i>and take the airport bus. I'm busy.</i>

03:49.103 --> 03:50.605
Hey, can I try this one on?

03:51.981 --> 03:52.899
I'm so sorry.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.653
We have some water leakage
in the fitting rooms.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.821
But I can give you 10% off instead.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.909
You don't need to try this on,
it looks like it was made for you.

04:03.618 --> 04:08.539
UNDER MAINTENANCE
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE

04:39.654 --> 04:43.866
Did I ever tell you
why this store is called the Siesta?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.747
Because you like
sleeping with me during the day?

04:53.835 --> 04:54.836
Yeah. You're right.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.756
So you can see some other bitch at night?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.268
How are wedding preparations?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.937
Why do you ask when you don't really care?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.273
Makes me seem nice.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.774
Bullshit.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.738
Let me know
if you ever want to get married.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.033
Because I don't like to share
with other women.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.665
PARK YEON-JIN

05:34.292 --> 05:35.543
WAITING FOR MY BABE

05:35.626 --> 05:36.794
AMAZING VIEW, THANK YOU

05:36.878 --> 05:38.504
WHICH DRESS? THEY'RE ALL SO PRETTY

05:47.430 --> 05:49.307
A LOT TO PREPARE, BUT I'M HAPPY! LOVE YOU!

06:21.297 --> 06:23.633
-Having fun at work?
-Yeah, lots of fun.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.677
The manager really likes you, you know.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.598
Apparently, since you started
tutoring their daughter,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.309
she started wearing less makeup.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.022
Got it.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.360
You know, I think she's starting
to move over to Instagram.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.529
That bitch Hye-jeong already switched.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.241
She doesn't do Facebook anymore?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.618
Cheer up, okay?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.745
Did you think revenge would be easy?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.706
When they all make the switch,
just use this account.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.292
The ID and password are
the same as the Facebook account.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.795
I didn't realize
I'd have to learn so much.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.213
Come on.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.426
I keep saying,
it's not too late to change your mind.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.929
Revenge is not good, and violent as hell.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.267
I know some intense guys
who are fine with some violence.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.018
I grew up with them at the group home.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.440
You think your friends
would kill someone for me?

07:22.358 --> 07:23.276
Kill someone?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.363
I don't know exactly what I need,

07:27.864 --> 07:31.409
but I've come too far
for this to be some half-assed crime.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.163
I need to do this step by step, carefully.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.498
Of course.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.836
But you're
at least halfway there, though.

07:43.921 --> 07:48.092
I read today that Park Yeon-jin is
getting married. Did you see?

07:49.510 --> 07:50.344
Mmm.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
I guess her dream came true.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.102
Of course it did.

08:01.939 --> 08:05.109
Know what's really great
about not being religious, Seong-hee?

08:10.031 --> 08:12.200
You know where you go when you die.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.328
To hell.

08:23.044 --> 08:27.381
<i>So, if I'm going to hell,</i>

08:28.549 --> 08:29.717
<i>I will do this.</i>

08:31.302 --> 08:33.346
<i>Step by step.</i>

08:34.805 --> 08:38.226
A BOOK ON THE GAME OF GO
THE GO STORY

08:47.818 --> 08:51.739
<i>I hope that you still want</i>
<i>to see me dance, Yeon-jin.</i>

08:54.617 --> 08:58.412
<i>Though this time,</i>
<i>I think it'll be a dance with the devil.</i>

09:04.961 --> 09:07.421
CAN YOU DO AN EXTRA MATH SESSION?
YOU CAN SET THE PRICE

09:14.554 --> 09:16.556
So, the quadratic formula.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.308
We'll derive it
using the perfect square equation

09:19.392 --> 09:21.143
to solve the quadratic equation.

09:21.227 --> 09:25.064
AX squared plus BX plus C equals--

09:25.147 --> 09:26.065
Ma'am.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.818
Where did you get that shirt?

09:29.735 --> 09:30.778
Somewhere online.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.699
-Are you listening to me?
-It's pretty.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.994
You should stop ignoring me.
Your exam is coming soon.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.495
You'd look even better without it.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.874
If you let me see your boobs,
I'll do better on the exam.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.795
I mean, you'll get paid extra
if I get better scores, won't you?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.464
<i>This doesn't</i>
<i>surprise me anymore.</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:52.174
<i>Thanks to you, Yeon-jin.</i>

09:53.050 --> 09:56.887
<i>I wonder how you people</i>
<i>always recognize the broken ones.</i>

09:58.514 --> 10:00.933
-This will be your last session with me.
-Why?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.436
I can make money through other jobs too.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.814
You're an asshole
who'll end up in the same place,

10:07.315 --> 10:09.233
no matter what grades you end up with.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.152
Jail.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.446
You crazy, bitch?
You'll be fucked when my mom finds out.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.406
She already knows.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.118
You mom's been listening
to our lessons since the very beginning.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.037
You know that this is
being recorded, right?

10:21.120 --> 10:21.954
PARK SEUNG-HUN'S MOM

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
Pay me more if you want me
to keep my mouth shut.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.710
God, this is fucking ridiculous.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.005
Don't you want to be a teacher?
And you do shit like this?

10:31.088 --> 10:33.674
I guess, yeah. I do now.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.259
Good luck on the test.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.715
He got into a fight nearby,
so he was brought to the hospital quickly.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.468
Seriously, you can't
give this guy a day off.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.679
After the results
of the hearing came out,

11:19.762 --> 11:22.473
seems like that psychopath is
always on TV nowadays.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.557
Really?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.937
Wish we could just unplug the TV.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.149
Please give him a 10% DW
mixed with vitamin B and C.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.067
Mmm.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.279
-Oh, the deputy director--
-I know.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.913
<i>The guardian</i>
<i>of patient Kim Min-Su in ward 62,</i>

11:45.996 --> 11:47.665
<i>please come back to the ward.</i>

11:48.165 --> 11:53.087
<i>The guardian of patient Kim Min-Su</i>
<i>in ward 62, please come back to the ward.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:37.339
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on your wedding, Yeon-jin.</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:40.885
<i>I'm sorry, but I didn't bring</i>
<i>any congratulatory money.</i>

12:41.927 --> 12:42.928
<i>Oh, well.</i>

12:43.012 --> 12:47.183
<i>A wedding won't be</i>
<i>the most important event in your life.</i>

12:50.227 --> 12:53.147
Fog and clouds
both consist of water vapor,

12:53.230 --> 12:56.901
but what they're called changes
depending on where they were formed.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.070
If it's closer to the sky in relation
to the ground, it's called a cloud.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.365
And it's called fog
if the vapor forms closer to the ground.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.749
Is something wrong? Is there a typo?

13:12.583 --> 13:13.417
There's not.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.587
It's so well-written, I reread it.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.173
By the way,

13:20.007 --> 13:22.259
why do all of you guys scare so easily?

13:27.348 --> 13:28.349
Seul-gi.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.478
You know all the other forecasters
talk behind my back, right?

13:33.354 --> 13:36.148
They think I'm less than them
because I can't write my own scripts.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.399
Huh?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.109
You know what I'm talking about.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.110
I'm not stupid.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.823
This is why I don't write my own.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.951
When I pay you,
I can get a script like this.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.328
But the ones I write sound like shit.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.039
Got a passport?

13:53.624 --> 13:55.334
-I don't.
-Then get one.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.337
And then tell me
a country you want to travel to.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.755
I like the script.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.800
You mean it?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.679
Thank you so much.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.891
I'll start researching places.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.025
I'm now her god,

14:21.068 --> 14:22.820
because I can throw a little money.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.743
When driving early in the morning
or late at night,

14:29.827 --> 14:31.120
when fog is most likely to form,

14:31.203 --> 14:33.080
please turn on your hazard lights

14:33.163 --> 14:35.708
and slow down
to ensure that you can drive safely.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.511
Fuck off, you little asshole!

14:55.728 --> 14:59.398
Ugh, this fucking dog
only shits when he's back home.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.941
Little asshole.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.526
Hey, don't insult Louis.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.778
Louis XI.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.866
It's because Louis is old. He's 11 now.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.411
You're young,
so what the fuck is wrong with you?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.164
With me? What?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.248
You taking some?

15:17.625 --> 15:18.626
Some what?

15:26.425 --> 15:27.426
Hey.

15:29.637 --> 15:33.891
Sa-ra told me
that you keep stealing her weed.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.771
I wasn't stealing it. No.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.024
I was worried about Sa-ra,
and taking a little sample to--

15:42.107 --> 15:42.942
Hey.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.653
Hey. Hey!

15:49.823 --> 15:51.408
Think you can just fuck around?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.828
Or that we're still "friends"
because we hang out?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.835
I have a lot of stuff
to inherit, Myeong-o.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.882
But if I die an untimely death
because you were driving while high,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.926
that wouldn't be fair for me, would it?

16:09.009 --> 16:10.511
Hey. Answer me.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.138
Answer me, asshole!

16:43.794 --> 16:46.088
Oh! Uh, I'm sorry.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.978
Uh, uh, wait a second.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.146
Hey, just hold on.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.024
I, uh…

17:47.775 --> 17:50.027
I know it doesn't look like it now,

17:50.944 --> 17:53.697
but I'm an intern here, so…

17:54.782 --> 17:55.783
It's my day off.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.284
Just wait, and…

18:08.545 --> 18:10.297
Press on this for about five minutes.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.275
Wait, where'd the patient go?

18:30.984 --> 18:32.236
Mmm, she just left.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.155
Hey, I'm okay now. Hmm?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.073
HCT: HEMATOCRIT TEST

18:36.156 --> 18:37.533
Her HCT looks awful. She just left?

18:37.616 --> 18:40.327
Hey, you know, I have
a lot of pain too, huh?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
I just got brought in, okay?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.247
Oh, come on. I'm gonna…

18:44.331 --> 18:45.332
Ugh.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.001
Just stay still. Go back to sleep.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.215
She didn't finish her IV.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.342
Let me see. Come on.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.014
She's anemic?

19:03.600 --> 19:05.936
All right,
before we start today's class,

19:06.019 --> 19:08.856
I've been wondering for a while.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.608
You in the back.
The handsome guy right there.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.864
Who are you? I really don't think
you're a student in my class.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.158
Oh, hello, Professor.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.577
I heard a rumor
that your class is exceptional,

19:21.660 --> 19:24.037
so I'm sitting in.
If you'd allow me to stay--

19:24.121 --> 19:26.707
I'm guessing
there's some other "exceptional" person

19:26.790 --> 19:28.000
who's why you're here.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.044
Oh, no way!
It's definitely you, Professor!

19:31.128 --> 19:31.962
I love you so much!

19:32.045 --> 19:34.631
Oh no, that's really too bad.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.134
I'm married, so get out.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.051
That's right.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.970
I didn't know that you were married.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.265
I'll be going now.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.144
Who is it?
Spill it. Who's so "exceptional"?

20:06.914 --> 20:07.915
You're here.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.962
I didn't hear back.
I thought you weren't here.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.673
I just have a class
I need to get credit for.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.760
-What are you doing on campus?
-Buying lunch for the kids in my club.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.471
Have you eaten? You should come with us.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.555
Mmm.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.706
How did you find out what school I go to?

20:51.416 --> 20:52.876
A nurse found your student ID

20:52.960 --> 20:54.711
while looking for the number
of your guardian.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.214
And I saw your school's name
and I went to the lecture hall

20:58.257 --> 20:59.591
because your test results…

20:59.675 --> 21:01.635
They came back, and they weren't great,

21:01.718 --> 21:03.512
so I brought your prescription.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.598
You should be more careful
with your health.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.936
You'll need to take medication
for at least six more months.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.774
The prescription I brought over
is no longer valid now.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.235
Make sure to take your meds.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.032
You like to play Go?

21:26.243 --> 21:27.494
Do you know how to play?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.705
Oh, I'm incredible.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.586
How long would I have to study Go
to beat somebody who's really good?

21:37.671 --> 21:40.507
Well, who are you trying to defeat?
Lee Se-dol?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.218
Lee Se-dol? Who is that?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.475
I think maybe you might need a tutor.

21:51.518 --> 21:54.021
Want me… as your tutor?

21:59.693 --> 22:02.654
I have to tutor someone,
so are evenings okay for you?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.948
GYODAE CAFE

22:06.992 --> 22:08.160
Really? In 2006?

22:09.578 --> 22:12.497
I know, right? But yeah, I was a freshman.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.333
Oh god, I just…

22:14.875 --> 22:17.377
I feel like I'm bragging
when I talk about this,

22:17.461 --> 22:19.379
but I was born in early 1989.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.007
But I was kind of a prodigy
when I was young,

22:22.090 --> 22:23.383
so I skipped some grades.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.888
So, should I speak more formally
with a prodigy?

22:28.930 --> 22:30.515
Do you like to be formal, then?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.936
I get the black because I'm new?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.233
So you already know.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.111
Put a stone on.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.831
Uh, wow.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.377
So.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.132
To sum up a game of Go,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.593
the person who has more houses
can win the game.

23:07.177 --> 23:10.055
Start near the end
and then build towards the center

23:10.138 --> 23:13.266
while building your own houses
and destroying your opponent's,

23:13.350 --> 23:16.478
and then you have to
slowly tighten your boundary.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.357
An intense battle… in silence.

23:26.863 --> 23:27.989
I like that.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.544
I didn't study herbal medicine,

24:22.627 --> 24:24.880
but <i>cheongsimhwan</i> will reduce anxiety.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.550
The National Teacher Qualification Exam.
I'm sure you'll pass it.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.109
Thank you so much for helping me.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.570
You're going to be a great doctor.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.406
Am I not seeing you again?

24:52.949 --> 24:53.950
Wait, why?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.995
I need to keep tutoring you.
You haven't beaten me yet.

24:57.954 --> 25:02.042
You're not the person
I'm actually trying to beat.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.632
In order to become a teacher,
you need to love humanity.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.675
This is the essence of your calling.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.845
It is your mission to provide…

25:13.929 --> 25:14.763
MOON DONG-EUN

25:14.846 --> 25:16.014
…high-quality education

25:16.097 --> 25:18.391
in order to cultivate talented students.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.353
<i>I really liked</i>
<i>the spring of 2015.</i>

25:22.062 --> 25:25.232
<i>I passed the Teacher Qualification Exam</i>
<i>after my second try.</i>

25:25.732 --> 25:28.735
<i>And thankfully, you became a mother.</i>

26:01.268 --> 26:03.395
<i>I came up with over 100 names</i>

26:03.478 --> 26:06.690
<i>for the child</i>
<i>that you'd give birth to in the fall.</i>

26:07.691 --> 26:09.526
<i>I even gave a little toast</i>

26:11.611 --> 26:14.906
<i>to my eventual moral decay,</i>

26:16.616 --> 26:18.326
<i>and to your destruction.</i>

26:20.537 --> 26:22.622
SEMYEONG STREET

26:23.582 --> 26:26.585
SUMMER OF 2021

26:55.864 --> 26:56.781
Happy birthday.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.491
Oh gosh, they're beautiful.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.536
Where'd you find these
in this gorgeous color?

27:03.371 --> 27:05.206
I thought you'd be able to pull it off.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.253
Gyeong-tae.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.590
He wants me to get a drink
with him and Sang-hyeon.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.926
-At this time of night? Crazy bastards.
-Just them?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.012
Definitely not.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.473
Sure you don't want to go?

27:21.556 --> 27:24.434
I'm sure.
The girls they're meeting are ugly.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.936
You would have gone if they were cute?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.813
How cute are we talking?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.693
You're just gonna brush your teeth, hmm?

27:33.777 --> 27:34.903
While I do this?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.156
That's why I'm doing it quickly.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.910
Gyeong-tae is so boring,

27:42.410 --> 27:44.537
and he's a complete mama's boy, too.

27:44.621 --> 27:48.375
His only attractive feature's his job,
but he's with a new girl every night.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.210
I didn't use to get that at all.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.170
And then,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.714
Hye-jeong made me realize the reason.

27:56.966 --> 27:57.967
What's the reason?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.805
I heard they did it
in the hotel lobby bathroom.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.432
They got turned on getting the hotel keys.

28:07.769 --> 28:08.978
Crazy bastard.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.608
Why? I'm a little curious.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.030
The space is tiny,
and people might be nearby.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.574
The marble feels so cold,

28:22.450 --> 28:24.119
but you and I are so hot.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.539
This place is kind of like that…

28:31.835 --> 28:32.836
but it's huge.

TO MY OLD FRIEND JO SOO-HYEON…

30:06.012 --> 30:07.263
CIALIS

30:12.060 --> 30:13.686
After a couple months here,

30:13.770 --> 30:16.898
this garden's still one of
my favorite things about this house.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.984
It looks expensive when the sun's up,

30:20.485 --> 30:22.779
and even expensive as the sun goes down.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.573
Guess it's worth my money, then.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.786
Is the commute okay?
It's a two-hour round trip to Seoul.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.955
I like it. It keeps me fit.

30:32.038 --> 30:35.542
You said you don't like women who let
themselves get fat after marriage, right?

30:36.042 --> 30:39.170
I'll wake up at 2:00 a.m.
and jump rope on an empty stomach.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.464
If I leave at 3:00, I'll be right on time.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.133
Why so early? It's a different show?

30:44.717 --> 30:46.636
It's because I'm old now, you know?

30:48.888 --> 30:50.765
Speaking of which, babe,

30:50.849 --> 30:55.019
is there any way you can give
our news network some ads?

30:55.103 --> 30:57.689
I need something
to leverage when I renew my contract.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.899
You should have told me earlier.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.151
If money could fix it…

31:03.695 --> 31:06.823
…then I think it's just about
the easiest problem in the world.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.241
Really?

31:08.908 --> 31:10.493
You're so awesome.

31:13.830 --> 31:17.000
So, will the PR team come to the station?

31:18.293 --> 31:19.127
They will.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.463
Those new cigarettes?

31:23.089 --> 31:23.923
Huh?

31:24.716 --> 31:25.633
Uh-huh.

31:30.096 --> 31:33.141
That friend of yours,
the flight attendant one?

31:33.224 --> 31:36.561
Hey, come on, her name is Hye-jeong.
You should know that by now.

31:39.522 --> 31:40.607
What about her?

31:41.107 --> 31:43.026
She told Gyeong-tae
what you were like in school.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.069
While they were drinking.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.616
What'd she say? About me?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.579
She said she had better grades than you.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.253
That was only one time!

32:02.337 --> 32:05.089
So, are you angry
because you heard I had bad grades?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.467
I don't like
that they dragged us through the mud.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.386
It was not "us."

32:10.970 --> 32:12.639
They always gossip about me.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.641
I'll take care of it.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.898
Mommy!

32:21.981 --> 32:22.982
Oh!

32:25.693 --> 32:27.862
Hi, Ye-sol.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.531
What do we do first when we get back?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.618
Wash my hands. I need to wash my hands!

32:37.580 --> 32:39.666
Oh my God.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.584
Now, that totally terrified me.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.836
You too. What do you do first
after smoking?

32:44.337 --> 32:46.381
You're so cute.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.595
Oh, shit…

32:52.679 --> 32:53.513
ARTIST LEE

32:53.596 --> 32:55.181
<i>Where are you?</i>

32:55.264 --> 32:56.933
Why is she so annoying today?

33:04.524 --> 33:05.525
Hmm.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.278
Hmm.

33:09.904 --> 33:10.905
It's pretty.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.291
What? What's up?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.712
That a new dress?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.714
Oh. Yeah, it is.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.799
My boyfriend bought it for me
at the Galleria.

33:31.968 --> 33:32.927
Hye-jeong.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.722
Is Sa-ra your boyfriend?

33:38.474 --> 33:40.560
Have you always "borrowed"
your customers' clothes?

33:40.643 --> 33:42.020
I told you she would,

33:42.520 --> 33:45.023
that she'd show up wearing your dress
if you gave it to her.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.191
At least she has good taste.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.278
if she picked your dress
out of all those clothes.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.779
Hey, Hye-jeong.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.907
I lost a Chanel today thanks to you.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.452
God, just use perfume.
Aren't you rich, huh?

33:57.535 --> 33:59.912
The product quality
matters more than the price.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.706
This gets rid of smells best.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.044
Ugh.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.963
There are only
two of these in the country.

34:10.006 --> 34:13.217
So, I guess now
you've got high standards, huh?

34:17.597 --> 34:18.431
Hye-jeong.

34:19.849 --> 34:20.850
Know your place.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.479
If it hadn't been Dong-eun back then…

34:26.522 --> 34:28.483
it would have ended up being you.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.567
Got that?

34:30.735 --> 34:31.819
Hye-jeong.

34:33.988 --> 34:36.866
Gyeong-tae is terrible at keeping secrets.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.536
And you gossiped about me?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.875
You should have stuck
to drinking and fucking him.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.670
Why'd you start talking about
shit from the past?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.006
Huh?

34:53.508 --> 34:55.176
We're not in high school anymore.

34:55.676 --> 34:58.012
You think we'll stay friends
no matter what?

34:59.806 --> 35:01.641
From now on, watch your mouth.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.727
And wear clothes you can afford.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.479
Know your place, Hye-jeong.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.565
Nod if you understand.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.703
I'm taking this, okay?

35:28.918 --> 35:32.338
Sa-ra, I'm so sorry about this.
I'll get this dress cleaned and I--

35:32.421 --> 35:34.799
Hey, you crazy bitch.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.301
You stretched it out.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.053
You can keep it.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.496
<i>A gift from my friends.</i>
<i>Thank you, guys!</i>

36:05.580 --> 36:08.666
<i>Surprise! With the lovely Park Yeon-jin.</i>

36:08.749 --> 36:10.459
<i>The weather is changing rapidly</i>

36:10.543 --> 36:12.587
<i>as we're approaching</i>
<i>the first weekend of March.</i>

36:12.670 --> 36:14.172
<i>What can you tell us, Ms. Park?</i>

36:15.089 --> 36:18.009
I am now standing in front of
the Gilsangsa Temple in Seoul.

36:18.092 --> 36:21.679
As you can see, the spring flowers have
bloomed beautifully around the temple.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.432
Particularly interesting is
the winter jasmine,

36:24.515 --> 36:25.725
which means "welcoming spring."

36:26.559 --> 36:27.894
<i>During the Joseon Dynasty,</i>

36:27.977 --> 36:29.854
<i>these flowers were</i>
<i>gives to the best in exams,</i>

36:29.937 --> 36:32.064
<i>which is why they're</i>
<i>known as the King's flowers.</i>

36:32.148 --> 36:34.692
<i>However, with the spring rain</i>
<i>that started yesterday,</i>

36:34.775 --> 36:36.819
<i>temperatures are dropping</i>
<i>all over the country.</i>

36:36.903 --> 36:39.363
<i>The rain is expected</i>
<i>to continue over the weekend,</i>

36:39.447 --> 36:41.699
<i>and will lead to a few very cold days.</i>

36:42.200 --> 36:44.785
<i>The temperatures are</i>
<i>seven degrees lower than average.</i>

36:44.869 --> 36:47.455
<i>In the mountainous regions,</i>
<i>the rain has already turned to snow,</i>

36:47.538 --> 36:49.999
<i>which might be continuing</i>
<i>today and tomorrow.</i>

36:50.833 --> 36:52.877
<i>If you're planning on</i>
<i>taking a weekend hike…</i>

36:52.960 --> 36:55.296
I watch the weather channel every day.

36:55.963 --> 36:59.550
<i>…in temperature between morning and night,</i>
<i>so please dress with care.</i>

36:59.634 --> 37:00.760
<i>This is Park Yeon-jin.</i>

37:06.515 --> 37:09.101
A NEW TOMORROW WITH JAEPYEONG
A FUTURE BUILT WITH JAEPYEONG

37:09.602 --> 37:10.478
JAEPYEONG CONSTRUCTION

37:34.877 --> 37:37.088
Ugh, not him again. Seriously?

37:37.171 --> 37:40.007
I told you
that you shouldn't go outside, no?

37:40.091 --> 37:42.677
I was bored,
and wanted to get some fresh air.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.596
What are you doing out in the rain?

37:46.347 --> 37:47.723
Did you get stood up again?

37:47.807 --> 37:49.100
What? Who, me?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.979
Not at all. I've never gotten stood up.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.147
I know you're dying inside.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.525
I wonder if the director knows about this.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.818
Ugh, come on.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.445
Don't get my family involved in all this.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.865
I'll think about it if you let me
have a sip of that coffee you're holding.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.534
That's not happening.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.327
Hey! Why are you stepping
in all the puddles?

38:08.411 --> 38:09.412
-Huh?
-Come over here.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.955
-Okay, okay.
-Seriously.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.007
God, it's raining like crazy out there.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.177
Jae-jun called, right?

38:25.261 --> 38:27.430
Uh, yeah, he needs more sweaters from you.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.683
Hold on.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.104
Oh, shit…

38:57.043 --> 38:57.960
Huh?

38:59.045 --> 38:59.920
Is that Dong-eun?

39:04.842 --> 39:05.760
It is.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.388
Whoa, what a coincidence.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.558
It's Myeong-o. You remember?

39:13.434 --> 39:14.435
Of course.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.520
It's been such a long time.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.688
Right.

39:19.565 --> 39:20.608
Wow…

39:22.693 --> 39:25.029
How've you been? What do you do?

39:26.072 --> 39:27.114
I'm a teacher now.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.241
Oh, really?

39:29.325 --> 39:30.951
I've been thinking about you a lot.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.704
You have?

39:37.833 --> 39:38.834
You buying those?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.171
Oh, no, I was just trying them on.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.218
No, no, no. Keep them on.

39:47.802 --> 39:48.803
They look nice.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.931
Here.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.189
Go look at them.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.251
Want a drink with me? Whatever you want.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.586
You can keep those on.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.922
The store's basically mine.

40:31.887 --> 40:34.306
Water, coffee, or booze?

40:40.980 --> 40:41.981
Coffee.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.541
So, what were you thinking about me?

41:05.588 --> 41:06.589
Was I…

41:07.840 --> 41:09.008
Was I your first kiss?

41:10.259 --> 41:12.761
Heh. Makes sense I was on your mind.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.100
Tell me now, is this store really yours?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.060
More or less.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.271
I dabble here and there.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.815
So I'm pretty busy, you know?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.776
Hey, Jae-jun called.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.778
He wants to know
why you're not picking up.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.490
He wants you to grab
his clothes from the laundromat

41:32.573 --> 41:33.991
and buy some dog food, too.

41:38.704 --> 41:40.498
God, he's such an asshole. Shit.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.084
That guy can't do anything without me.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.046
That's Jae-jun, remember?

41:48.631 --> 41:50.007
I guess nothing's changed.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.760
Because you are
still his little errand boy.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.345
Hey, come on, cut it out.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.263
Life is so unfair.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.143
While I was training to be a teacher
and you were getting him dog food,

42:01.227 --> 42:04.104
he inherited a golf course
and now owns this store,

42:04.188 --> 42:05.606
because he was born lucky.

42:07.399 --> 42:11.028
That's why I hoped
all this belonged to you.

42:11.111 --> 42:12.905
For a second I really hoped it did.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.657
Are you trying to insult me?

42:17.618 --> 42:18.577
Watch your mouth.

42:19.578 --> 42:20.704
I can still hit you.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.502
How about you pick another punching bag?

42:27.795 --> 42:30.631
If you do that,
maybe everything here could be yours.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.466
The hell do you mean?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.885
I learned something
pretty intense recently.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.597
I don't think
that I can handle it by myself.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.231
Do you want to know
why I'm telling you all this?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.401
I thought you'd understand
wanting to destroy them.

42:52.027 --> 42:52.861
And also,

42:54.196 --> 42:55.906
back when everything happened,

42:56.907 --> 42:58.576
I was actually scared of you

42:59.368 --> 43:00.452
more than the others.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.333
You were?

43:08.711 --> 43:09.628
What is it?

43:10.796 --> 43:12.381
This "intense" stuff?

43:16.385 --> 43:19.179
So you don't drink much,
but you can hold your liquor.

43:20.055 --> 43:23.976
I'm usually drunk after one glass,
but I guess I'm just excited today.

43:24.059 --> 43:27.229
Uh, that's good to hear.
Makes me feel special.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.107
Aw, no, come on.
Of course you're special to me.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.401
Huh?

43:32.484 --> 43:33.902
By the way, I want to ask…

43:34.862 --> 43:37.114
So do you wear that watch all the time?

43:37.197 --> 43:38.282
Watch?

43:39.575 --> 43:43.162
Uh… My dad bought this
when he was assigned his first school.

43:43.245 --> 43:44.872
He wanted to pass it on to his son.

43:44.955 --> 43:47.333
He just had a thing
for creating traditions like this.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.461
Wow, so sweet.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.296
But he's old.

43:53.297 --> 43:57.259
It's hard to pay for his nursing staff
right now, and those hospital bills.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.596
So I really need to pass
my School Inspector Exam this time.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.264
My wife even prays for it in church.

44:03.098 --> 44:04.099
Does it work?

44:05.392 --> 44:08.228
I feel like I'm just trudging
forward on my own.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.731
I don't think God has
ever really helped me.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.149
Huh?

44:13.609 --> 44:15.402
Uh, you praying for something?

44:16.862 --> 44:20.866
Yeah. Just for you
to pass your exam this time around.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.494
I really hope that you pass.

44:23.577 --> 44:25.871
I'm rooting for you with all my heart.

44:27.122 --> 44:28.165
SEMYEONG REAL ESTATE

44:28.248 --> 44:29.083
Oh, thanks.

44:29.583 --> 44:32.795
You know, when you're drinking,
your eyes look so pretty.

44:32.878 --> 44:33.879
Is that so?

44:35.422 --> 44:37.007
Well, my legs are prettier.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.305
Mm-hmm.

44:45.265 --> 44:46.266
Yes, hello?

44:46.809 --> 44:49.728
<i>Hello, I'm calling</i>
<i>from Semyeong Real Estate.</i>

44:53.440 --> 44:56.819
<i>There's a vacancy in the apartment</i>
<i>that you were interested in renting.</i>

44:56.902 --> 44:57.736
RENTAL CONTRACT

44:57.820 --> 44:59.196
<i>Bring your seal with you, okay?</i>

45:26.932 --> 45:28.600
You're looking for this, right?

45:52.249 --> 45:53.667
How long have you done this?

45:54.209 --> 45:56.795
I only noticed you doing this last fall.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.881
Don't try to lie to me.

45:59.923 --> 46:02.050
You may have avoided security cameras,

46:02.676 --> 46:05.637
but I have your photos stored in my phone.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.558
I've collected pictures of you.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.062
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>God never helps me.</i>

46:14.646 --> 46:17.399
<i>Why did this employee</i>
<i>at the chairman's house</i>

46:17.483 --> 46:19.777
<i>have to be this observant</i>
<i>and this patient?</i>

46:26.283 --> 46:28.952
If you want money from me, it's yours.

46:29.661 --> 46:32.331
I don't want money.
I'm not going to report you.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.668
I don't know what you're trying to do,

46:37.753 --> 46:39.630
but I feel like you'll succeed,

46:39.713 --> 46:41.924
since you've been doing this
for half a year.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.344
I want to be on your side.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.264
I'll help you out with what you need,

46:50.265 --> 46:51.517
so please help me, too.

46:56.063 --> 46:59.316
And what do you want me to do?

47:02.444 --> 47:03.445
My husband…

47:05.739 --> 47:06.782
kill him.
