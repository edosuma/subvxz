WEBVTT

00:44.577 --> 00:47.414
All right,
so just watch his ears, okay?

00:48.414 --> 00:51.519
So... who's he paying
attention to right now?

00:53.519 --> 00:55.421
He's listening to me.
See his ear?

00:55.421 --> 00:59.759
Oh, a little sass!
You see that?

01:00.759 --> 01:02.428
He's trying to get out.

01:02.428 --> 01:07.333
All right, when he does that,
I'm just gonna make him
work a little bit harder. Okay?

01:07.333 --> 01:10.202
So, I'm keeping him moving.
He disobeyed a little bit.

01:10.202 --> 01:14.507
Keeping him moving.
I'm teaching him that when
he disobeys, he gets work,

01:14.507 --> 01:17.677
and when he obeys,
he gets rest.

01:18.677 --> 01:22.648
So, when he obeys
and he's trotting well
and he's listening...

01:22.648 --> 01:24.151
Good, Cody.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.253
Turning my back to him,
giving him a break.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.787
And if he's learned
his lesson...

01:28.787 --> 01:30.858
Let's see. Is he gonna come?

01:32.858 --> 01:35.929
-Good boy, Cody.
-So cool.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.831
Good job, sis.

01:39.831 --> 01:42.801
What you wanna do
is you wanna make
your loop big.

01:42.801 --> 01:44.602
And then you wanna hold it
where the ropes go.

01:44.602 --> 01:46.602
You wanna grab it
with this hand.

01:44.602 --> 01:46.906
You gotta be the boss, right?

01:46.906 --> 01:48.807
Because the horse always
has to have a leader.

01:48.807 --> 01:50.209
And if you're not
gonna be the leader,

01:50.209 --> 01:51.709
then he's gonna be
the leader, okay?

01:53.512 --> 01:55.414
I'm not a steer.
Hold on. Now hold up.

01:55.414 --> 01:59.785
Pull back hard.
Pull back towards your belly.
Come on, yeah, pull it.

01:59.785 --> 02:03.721
There you go. Perfect.
High five.

02:03.721 --> 02:05.721
Thank you.

02:03.721 --> 02:05.758
Thank you, guys.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.294
I'll see you Wednesday, okay?
So good to see you.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.798
Lee.

02:12.798 --> 02:15.366
I just wanted
to thank you so much.

02:15.366 --> 02:16.702
Bella loves her lessons.

02:16.702 --> 02:19.672
Thank you. You're really
doing amazing, Bella.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.841
I can't believe you only
have six months left
of high school.

02:22.841 --> 02:25.212
-Yeah.
-Do you know what you want
 to do when you graduate?

02:27.212 --> 02:28.714
No, not yet.

02:31.650 --> 02:34.486
If I hear one more person
ask me what I wanna do
when I graduate...

02:35.486 --> 02:39.491
It's like I'm being
slowly tortured every day
by the mothers of my students.

02:39.491 --> 02:40.793
You'll figure it out.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.761
What if I don't?

02:42.761 --> 02:44.964
You're lucky.
You already know
what you want to do.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.432
Why don't you just
go to college
like everyone else?

02:47.432 --> 02:48.734
You didn't.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.970
I know. I'm not like
everyone else.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.375
I wanted to be here,
not in a classroom.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.910
You get way better grades
than I ever got.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.611
You can probably go
to any school you want.

02:59.611 --> 03:01.747
Yeah, but I don't want
to waste all that time
and money

03:01.747 --> 03:03.716
if I don't know
what I want to do.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.883
Well, there's nothing wrong
with staying here,

03:05.883 --> 03:08.621
training horses
and giving lessons.
The kids love you.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.889
Yeah, and I love it.

03:11.889 --> 03:15.328
I just want to do
something big. You know?

03:16.328 --> 03:19.497
Something epic
that'll really push me,

03:19.497 --> 03:23.436
that's unique and...

03:24.436 --> 03:25.473
significant.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.407
So you want to be
a person of distinction?

03:29.407 --> 03:32.277
Gross.
Now you sound like Dad.

03:32.277 --> 03:34.812
I used to get so sick
of hearing that growing up.

03:34.812 --> 03:37.782
Well, he doesn't really
say it anymore.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.453
Yeah, I guess
it has been a while.

03:41.453 --> 03:44.323
I just wish I could figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

03:44.323 --> 03:45.557
Hey.

03:46.557 --> 03:47.894
Dreams take time.

03:48.894 --> 03:51.698
Sometimes you find your path
when you least expect it.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.533
That's easy for you to say.

03:55.533 --> 03:56.970
What's that?

03:57.970 --> 04:00.572
Okay. Chief says he's tired
of listening to your problems

04:00.572 --> 04:01.907
and he wants to go run.

04:01.907 --> 04:03.574
Isn't that right,
Chief? Okay!

04:03.574 --> 04:05.678
What's that? What?

04:05.678 --> 04:07.479
Oh, okay, I'll make sure
I tell him.

04:07.479 --> 04:09.782
Cody's concerned that
you're not gonna be able
to handle

04:09.782 --> 04:11.417
losing to
your baby sister again.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.950
Again?
That's never gonna happen.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.950
Okay, all right.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.354
Come on. Let's go, Chief.

04:15.354 --> 04:17.088
All right.
I'm already winning.

04:17.088 --> 04:20.817
I don't remember
any time you've ever
beaten me. Come on.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.557
Did you let me win?

04:52.557 --> 04:54.394
No. I would never
do that.

04:56.394 --> 04:57.130
Let's go again.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.130
Well, that was
the warm-up.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.764
Okay.

04:59.764 --> 05:01.399
Oh, you want to actually
race for real?

05:01.399 --> 05:03.399
Yeah.

05:01.399 --> 05:03.740
It's two out of three anyway.

05:09.507 --> 05:11.410
Dude, come play.
I can't kill all these
undead things on my own.

05:11.410 --> 05:12.410
In a minute.

05:11.410 --> 05:12.011
Hey, Jordan.

05:13.011 --> 05:15.747
Hey, Lee.
Done shoveling you-know-what?

05:15.747 --> 05:17.916
Can I say that
to a Southern belle?

05:17.916 --> 05:21.553
I am not a Southern belle.
And there's a lot more
to keeping horses than that.

05:21.553 --> 05:23.788
Casey, how can this guy
be your best friend
for so long

05:23.788 --> 05:25.490
and still be so clueless
about horses?

05:25.490 --> 05:27.625
Oh, he hates horses.
He's scared of 'em.

05:27.625 --> 05:32.163
I'm not scared.
 They're just all stinky and scratchy.

05:32.163 --> 05:34.166
How would you know?
You've barely been
around them.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.166
I just know.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.168
What, are you
a horse-ist?

05:37.168 --> 05:38.137
A what?

05:39.137 --> 05:40.773
I don't know.
It's my word

05:40.773 --> 05:42.774
for someone bigoted
against horses.

05:42.774 --> 05:45.043
Good try.
It's not a word.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.944
Don't mess
with the etymologist.

05:46.944 --> 05:49.781
Oh, okay, well,
impressive vocab, college boy.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.781
But you should probably
just stick to football.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.117
Happy to.

05:52.117 --> 05:54.153
And that whole little
wingback thingy you do.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.755
I'm a tailback,
and your brother was a fullback.

05:56.755 --> 05:58.490
Neither of them
start with "wing."

05:58.490 --> 06:00.490
I don't know why
she can't remember that.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.026
Okay, whatever. I...

06:01.026 --> 06:02.627
He just got
a scholarship offer

06:02.627 --> 06:04.764
to play at the best school
in California.

06:05.764 --> 06:07.966
Wait, really?

06:07.966 --> 06:10.067
Jordan, but...

06:10.067 --> 06:12.904
Wait, how does that work?
You're already in college.

06:12.904 --> 06:14.505
D2 transfer.

06:14.505 --> 06:16.108
You're gonna have
to explain that
to a horse girl.

06:16.108 --> 06:19.646
I'm transferring
from a small school
to a big school.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.947
That's huge.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.916
You've got the next
two years of your life
figured out.

06:24.916 --> 06:28.555
Any beyond that, too.
They got a pretty great
business school.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.690
I'm so happy for you.

06:32.690 --> 06:33.896
Thanks, Lee.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.168
Jubilee!

06:44.168 --> 06:45.637
What?

06:45.637 --> 06:46.175
Jubilee!

06:51.175 --> 06:53.175
Get in here.

06:51.175 --> 06:53.579
I forgot that was
her real name.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.579
Are you ready
to play yet?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.480
What?

06:55.480 --> 06:58.218
I figured it out. We're gonna
ride our horses cross-country.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.985
What are you talking about?

07:00.985 --> 07:02.588
You remember those riders

07:02.588 --> 07:04.923
that stayed on our property
when we were kids?

07:04.923 --> 07:07.923
Not really.

07:04.923 --> 07:07.726
That's what they were doing.
It took me a while,

07:07.726 --> 07:10.928
but I found a whole bunch
of routes on the web.

07:10.928 --> 07:12.764
It's gonna take us
about three months.

07:12.764 --> 07:15.733
But as soon as you graduate,
we're gonna jump
on Cody and Chief

07:15.733 --> 07:16.903
and we're gonna ride west...

07:17.903 --> 07:20.242
until I can throw
my lucky horseshoe
into the Pacific.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.011
Come on, Lee. It'll be epic.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.146
Y'all have lost it.
I mean, what are you gonna do?

07:28.146 --> 07:30.182
Get on your horse
and ride down the freeway?

07:30.182 --> 07:33.519
No, there's a system of trails,

07:33.519 --> 07:35.821
back roads, and farms
that people have
already trekked.

07:35.821 --> 07:38.821
That's incredible.

07:35.821 --> 07:38.257
That can't be safe.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.259
That's the whole point.
That's the adventure.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.160
- We could run out of water.
- Or food.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.663
- We could get lost.
-  -Our horses could  go lame or get sick.

07:44.663 --> 07:47.833
Some days we could ride
for 30 miles and not see
another soul.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.002
I mean,
think about the challenge.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.538
This would be the hardest thing
we've ever done.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.208
And you'll get time to get away
and think about your future.

07:56.208 --> 08:00.178
Yeah. I love it.
But what will Dad think?

08:01.178 --> 08:03.214
Who cares.
What do you think?

08:03.214 --> 08:05.086
This is about
something big, Lee.

08:08.086 --> 08:09.154
Let's do it.

08:10.154 --> 08:12.154
Let me show you something.

08:10.154 --> 08:12.057
Okay, all right.

08:12.057 --> 08:14.261
I don't get you horse people.
Logan!

08:16.261 --> 08:19.232
Your brother's stuck
in horse land.
Help me kill these ghouls.

08:20.232 --> 08:22.232
They're zombies.

08:20.232 --> 08:22.668
Whatever, just help me win.

08:23.668 --> 08:26.305
All right, see ya, Dad!
Gotta head down
to the group home for a bit.

08:26.305 --> 08:29.274
Hey, whoa, was that
that Big Brother thing
you're talking about?

08:29.274 --> 08:30.175
Yeah.

08:30.175 --> 08:31.812
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:34.812 --> 08:35.416
I'm proud of you.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.217
And, um, just so you know,
your name's written
all over that one over there.

08:40.217 --> 08:42.955
Oh, wow. When do you think
that'll be done?

08:42.955 --> 08:45.955
I don't know.
Whenever I finish this one.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.657
Thanks, Dad.

08:45.657 --> 08:47.993
Well, no hurry.
I like my old truck.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.993
See ya, Dad.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.836
Yep. Have fun, son.

09:04.009 --> 09:05.009
Wha...

10:11.043 --> 10:13.070
Okay. Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

11:39.397 --> 11:42.067
Mint chocolate.
Your favorite.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.870
Thank you, Brooklyn.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.270
See? I know my girl.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.840
You are the best.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.876
You didn't answer
my texts last night.
You all right?

11:51.876 --> 11:55.280
Yeah. I just got
a lot of work to do
on the farm right now.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
Sorry. It's keeping me busy.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.884
Hmm.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.884
Yo, Lee.
What's up, Brooklyn?

11:58.884 --> 12:01.153
What's going on, ladies?

12:01.153 --> 12:04.255
Hey, so, our band's got
a gig this week at the barn.
Y'all should come.

12:04.255 --> 12:07.091
We're debuting.
We're called Black Eye Culture.
It's gonna be awesome.

12:07.091 --> 12:08.293
Everybody's gonna
be there.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.293
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.561
Yeah.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.962
And I know that
you don't get out much,

12:11.962 --> 12:13.498
so you should come.

12:13.498 --> 12:16.902
Yeah, I've got a lot
going on right now.
But we'll see.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.937
It'll take your mind
off things.
So I'll text you.

12:19.937 --> 12:21.937
Okay.

12:19.937 --> 12:21.576
Yeah.

12:24.576 --> 12:28.179
He can't handle that you
turned him down last summer.
He's totally still into you.

12:28.179 --> 12:31.182
No. He flirts like that
with everyone, Brook.

12:31.182 --> 12:33.432
Girl, you cannot be
that clueless.

12:47.432 --> 12:50.335
What are you eating, Logan?

12:50.335 --> 12:52.471
What? That's all there is.

12:53.471 --> 12:56.541
Uh, why don't you just ask Dad
to get more food?

12:56.541 --> 13:00.048
How? I never see him.
He's either at work
or in the garage.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.549
Hey, Dad.

13:05.549 --> 13:06.751
Hey.

13:07.751 --> 13:11.222
Uh, I really need you
to make Logan's lunch
for tomorrow morning.

13:11.222 --> 13:13.357
He's been eating junk
all day.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.230
You know where the wallet is.
Give him some money.

13:18.230 --> 13:22.000
No. Dad, I mean I need you
to go get him some food
from the store.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.238
There's barely any left.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.341
Fine.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.477
Dad, he's still just a kid.

13:33.477 --> 13:35.515
You need to make him a meal
every once in a while.

13:38.515 --> 13:42.386
I have a test tomorrow.
And I have twice the amount
of work to do at the barn.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.655
I can't do it all.

13:44.655 --> 13:48.128
You know what?
Then why don't you
just sell Chief.

13:50.128 --> 13:51.965
What?

13:53.965 --> 13:56.101
Lee, I don't know anything
about this horse stuff.

13:56.101 --> 13:59.004
But what I do know
is he'd be a lot less work
if you got rid of him.

14:00.004 --> 14:03.541
You know what?
 Why don't you let me handle the horses

14:03.541 --> 14:05.376
and you work on being
an actual father

14:05.376 --> 14:07.280
and taking care of
your son who needs you.

15:20.485 --> 15:22.226
Come on, buddy.

15:29.226 --> 15:30.097
Good boy.

15:33.097 --> 15:36.634
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
let them sell you.

15:37.634 --> 15:38.437
Okay?

15:55.386 --> 15:56.255
What are you doing here?

15:57.255 --> 15:58.357
You all right?

15:59.357 --> 16:02.726
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just working out
some of the horses.

16:02.726 --> 16:04.062
What's up?

16:04.062 --> 16:07.802
Just wanted to come by
and see how you
and everyone else was doing.

16:10.802 --> 16:12.669
You guys were kind of like
a family to me

16:12.669 --> 16:15.807
when I didn't have
much family to go home to.

16:15.807 --> 16:18.077
Just wanted to come check in,
see if I can help out
with something.

16:20.077 --> 16:21.645
Don't you have
football stuff to do?

16:21.645 --> 16:24.615
Not now.
Just conditioning.

16:24.615 --> 16:26.583
I can do some of that
here, you know.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.553
Throw around some of
those hay cubes,

16:29.553 --> 16:31.456
or whatever you call them.

16:31.456 --> 16:35.360
Uh, I guess
I could use the help.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.464
Uh, maybe just a little,
you know, filling in
for what Casey used to do.

16:39.464 --> 16:41.832
Yeah, 100%.

16:41.832 --> 16:44.436
Maybe you could
come by Saturday,
if you wanted?

16:44.436 --> 16:46.304
Yeah. I'm up early
working out anyway.

16:47.304 --> 16:48.240
5:30 a.m.?

16:49.240 --> 16:50.308
Wow. Uh...

16:51.308 --> 16:53.546
I guess I could go to sleep
a little earlier.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.714
It would only be
three mornings a week

16:56.714 --> 16:58.716
and maybe Saturday,
if you have the time.

16:58.716 --> 17:00.122
Yeah, consider it done.

17:04.122 --> 17:05.223
Thank you, Jordan.

17:07.223 --> 17:08.194
So much.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.730
Maybe you could use
this time to yourself...

17:13.730 --> 17:16.134
just to process everything,
you know?

17:17.134 --> 17:19.368
I know I needed that
when my mom left us.

17:19.368 --> 17:21.368
I'm fine, Jordan.

17:19.368 --> 17:21.704
All right.

17:21.704 --> 17:25.477
All right.

17:25.477 --> 17:26.345
Now, remember,
I'm a city kid.

17:27.345 --> 17:29.547
Don't get your expectations
up too high.

17:29.547 --> 17:31.217
I don't know the first thing
about a barn.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.818
And you know I hate horses.
But I can shovel.

17:34.818 --> 17:37.189
Well, if that's what you like,
I've got plenty of that to do.

17:38.189 --> 17:41.189
Or maybe something cleaner.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.528
I like the idea
of staying clean.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.498
No such thing
when you're with horses.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.498
I'll see you Saturday?

17:46.498 --> 17:48.866
Yeah.

17:48.866 --> 17:51.436
Bright and way too early.

17:52.436 --> 17:54.669
All right, sounds good.

18:52.896 --> 18:55.532
Dad! Dad!

18:55.532 --> 18:56.002
Yeah! Yeah!

18:58.002 --> 19:00.939
Come on. Breakfast.
I'm making your favorite.
Get up. Let's go.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.939
What?

19:00.939 --> 19:03.987
Come on. Breakfast.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.325
I'm gonna do
a cross-country ride.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.593
Can I go?

19:21.593 --> 19:22.828
No.

19:24.828 --> 19:27.699
Jordan said he'd help
just with the chores,

19:27.699 --> 19:30.401
so I will have time
to train the horses.

19:30.401 --> 19:33.401
He'll get sick
of that fast.

19:30.401 --> 19:33.438
He hates horses.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.707
Well, either way,
I'll still figure it out.

19:35.707 --> 19:39.010
So it's just like the time
you built that tree house
in the backyard, right?

19:40.010 --> 19:41.010
What are you talking about?

19:40.010 --> 19:41.012
You go out in the backyard

19:42.012 --> 19:44.648
to try and build a tree house,
and who ended up fixing it?

19:44.648 --> 19:45.017
Casey.

19:46.017 --> 19:47.519
I was 12.

19:48.519 --> 19:50.755
It's not like that.
This is gonna be different, Dad.

19:50.755 --> 19:51.663
Whatever.

19:59.663 --> 20:01.800
I'm doing this, Dad.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.609
Logan, it's time for bed.

20:45.609 --> 20:46.612
Logan?

20:47.612 --> 20:48.746
Good night.

20:48.746 --> 20:50.647
Hey, this is
the first night

20:50.647 --> 20:53.519
I haven't had
to pry you away
from the video games.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.355
What, are you sick?

20:57.355 --> 20:59.398
I'm just tired of being
by myself all the time.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.671
I want somebody
to hang out with.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.839
What's gonna happen
when you go?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.910
It's just gonna be
for a couple of months.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.112
Dad will be better
by then.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.823
Are you sure?

21:31.823 --> 21:33.559
I miss how Mom
used to put me to bed.

21:35.559 --> 21:38.468
Remember how she'd tuck in
the covers real tight?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.614
Come on. Let's go.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.419
Hey.

22:01.419 --> 22:02.756
Don't worry, okay?

22:04.756 --> 22:08.595
I'm here for you.
No matter what.

22:10.595 --> 22:11.773
Good night, Logan.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.791
Whoa!

22:40.791 --> 22:44.194
Yeah, I specialize
in physical therapy
using horseback riding.

22:44.194 --> 22:45.029
I didn't realize
you could.

22:46.029 --> 22:48.532
It really works well
with kids that love
to ride.

22:48.532 --> 22:49.666
This is great.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.669
So, I'll teach you
some exercises

22:51.669 --> 22:53.069
that you can do with her.

22:53.069 --> 22:55.940
First make sure her
knee brace is on tight.

22:55.940 --> 22:59.743
Okay. Open it up
and pull it snug.

22:59.743 --> 23:01.211
Cool, so you wanna go
for a spin?

23:01.211 --> 23:04.782
All right. I'm gonna
take these reigns from you.

23:05.782 --> 23:07.718
We're just gonna
come on in here.

23:16.894 --> 23:18.895
Hey, Dad!

23:18.895 --> 23:20.833
Wanna play
some basketball?

23:21.833 --> 23:23.108
Maybe later.

23:32.108 --> 23:34.108
Mr. Grove.

23:32.108 --> 23:34.145
Hey.

23:35.145 --> 23:38.215
Hey, uh, why don't I
take this up to the house,

23:38.215 --> 23:41.818
and you maybe play some
basketball with Logan?

23:41.818 --> 23:43.753
It would mean
a lot to him.

23:43.753 --> 23:45.589
Yeah, yeah, sure.

23:45.589 --> 23:47.124
I bet you're really good
at basketball.

23:47.124 --> 23:48.259
What makes you say that?

23:49.259 --> 23:53.597
Uh, just because
you grew up around it,
and, uh, I just--

23:53.597 --> 23:55.166
Because I'm black?

23:56.166 --> 23:58.569
Well, that,
and you're an athlete.

23:59.569 --> 24:02.240
Well, maybe you should
be careful with
your assumptions.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.609
You might hurt some people.

24:05.609 --> 24:07.011
Yeah, yeah.

24:08.011 --> 24:10.550
Sorry.
Won't happen again.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.152
I'm actually pretty bad
at basketball.

24:15.152 --> 24:17.152
Okay.

24:15.152 --> 24:17.788
So he'll probably beat me.

24:17.788 --> 24:19.257
Okay, cool. Thanks.

24:19.257 --> 24:22.692
If it gets too bad,
I'll be running
in the house.

24:27.765 --> 24:29.739
Hey, check up,
little man.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.739
Whoa!

24:34.739 --> 24:36.173
Ooh!

24:36.173 --> 24:37.240
Oh!

24:37.240 --> 24:39.210
Okay, all right,
pressure's on.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.913
Money!

24:43.314 --> 24:46.284
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Let's go, baby.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.284
Yeah, winner takes all.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.654
Next point wins.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.788
Oh, take that!

24:52.990 --> 24:54.593
Oh, no!

24:55.593 --> 24:57.193
What you got?
Pressure's on, bro!

24:57.193 --> 24:59.193
Five, four...

24:57.193 --> 24:59.130
You sure about this?

24:59.130 --> 25:01.665
...three, two, one!

25:01.665 --> 25:02.732
Whoo! Ha ha!

25:02.732 --> 25:05.670
Ah! Ah! He makes it!

25:05.670 --> 25:07.670
Whoo! Whoo!

25:05.670 --> 25:07.939
Yeah!

25:07.939 --> 25:09.973
Oh, that was awesome!

25:09.973 --> 25:11.041
Yeah!

25:12.209 --> 25:13.877
You're getting good, man.

25:13.877 --> 25:14.877
Thanks.

25:13.877 --> 25:14.982
Yeah.

25:18.982 --> 25:21.818
Hey, have you ever,
uh, seen your sister

25:21.818 --> 25:25.990
like, really sad about
your brother's death?

25:25.990 --> 25:29.661
Like... Like,
let out a big, ugly cry.

25:30.661 --> 25:35.835
I don't know. Maybe a little.
I mean, at the funeral.

25:37.835 --> 25:39.703
We just don't hang out
that much.

25:39.703 --> 25:40.306
Ah.

25:42.306 --> 25:44.609
You know,
being sad's okay.

25:45.609 --> 25:47.846
It's how you get
through it.

25:48.846 --> 25:51.249
I had to learn the hard way
after my mom...

25:52.249 --> 25:54.720
left us for some rich guy.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.327
Took years for me
to finally let it all out.

26:03.327 --> 26:05.866
Then I finally wasn't
so mad anymore.

26:09.866 --> 26:13.941
I cried a lot...
about Casey.

26:16.941 --> 26:18.676
That's good.

26:19.676 --> 26:21.679
Your family can learn
from you, little man.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.280
All right,
I got one more in me.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.280
All right. I start.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.652
Yeah.

26:27.652 --> 26:28.818
Let's do this.

26:33.089 --> 26:34.660
Hello, pretty lady.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.297
Oh, I didn't forget
about you, girl.

26:40.297 --> 26:41.700
A granola bar?

26:42.700 --> 26:45.169
Really?
You're spoiling them,
you know.

26:45.169 --> 26:47.304
Just trying to butter
these old ladies up.

26:47.304 --> 26:49.907
-You know I'm a flirt.
-They're boys, you know.

26:50.907 --> 26:52.042
Right.

26:52.042 --> 26:54.178
I thought you hated horses.

26:54.178 --> 26:56.180
I'm trying to give 'em
a chance.

26:56.180 --> 27:00.886
I don't want to be a horse-ist
since we're all gonna be
in the same work space.

27:02.886 --> 27:05.056
Okay, well,
just no junk food, please.

27:05.056 --> 27:06.057
I'm trying to get 'em
trained up.

27:07.057 --> 27:08.894
Sure thing, boss.

27:10.894 --> 27:12.463
Whoa. What's he doing?

27:13.463 --> 27:15.800
That's Chief.
He was Casey's.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.736
I think he likes you.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.137
Yeah, I'm still getting used
to these things.

27:21.137 --> 27:22.338
You are scared of them.

27:22.338 --> 27:24.909
Okay, maybe a little bit.

27:24.909 --> 27:28.346
But, uh, I'm all done,
so I was gonna take off.

27:29.346 --> 27:32.284
Thanks. You know,
for spending time
with Logan.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.352
I haven't seen him smile
like that in days.

27:35.352 --> 27:36.355
Pleasure's all mine.

27:39.355 --> 27:41.827
So, what's all that stuff
on the table?

27:42.827 --> 27:44.328
I'm gonna do
the cross-country ride.

27:45.328 --> 27:47.865
Just after graduation,
like Case and I planned.

27:47.865 --> 27:49.865
Really?

27:47.865 --> 27:49.967
Yeah.

27:49.967 --> 27:52.502
So, how does this work?
You're just gonna get on a horse
and ride off into the sunset?

27:52.502 --> 27:56.106
Well, I mean do you just
put on your wingback helmet
and jump on the field?

27:56.106 --> 27:59.977
No. It's tailback.

27:59.977 --> 28:02.846
Well, it's like prepping
for an ultramarathon,

28:02.846 --> 28:06.083
so I'll have to train
three horses: Cody, Chief,
and a packhorse.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.221
You have to get them
all ready just in case
one of them gets hurt.

28:10.221 --> 28:14.125
Are you really gonna do
all of this by yourself?

28:14.125 --> 28:16.093
Well, I mean,
I'll have the horses.

28:16.093 --> 28:19.195
And I'll meet up
with some riders
on the trail, I'm sure.

28:19.195 --> 28:22.365
Oh, that sounds really safe.
Toothless mountain men
coming out of the woods

28:22.365 --> 28:23.834
with guns and stuff.

28:23.834 --> 28:24.039
Oh, shut up.

28:30.039 --> 28:31.510
This is my dream.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.148
I'm all about dreams.
Talk to me.

28:38.148 --> 28:40.153
I want to prove
I can do something big.

28:42.153 --> 28:46.291
To my dad, to Case,
and to myself.

28:48.291 --> 28:52.565
I just need to get out
of here for a while
and think about my life.

28:54.565 --> 28:56.970
Figure out my place
in the world.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.306
You gotta do it.

29:02.306 --> 29:05.310
Me and Case always talked
about, you know,
dreams aren't easy.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.282
But they're worth
fighting for.

29:12.282 --> 29:13.051
I believe in you, Lee.

29:15.051 --> 29:16.069
I really do.

29:33.069 --> 29:35.239
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what that was.

29:35.239 --> 29:37.340
Uh,
don't worry about it.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.442
I should...
I should probably just go.

29:39.442 --> 29:41.045
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

29:41.045 --> 29:42.279
See you Monday?

29:42.279 --> 29:43.582
Yeah. Monday.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.584
Bright and way too early.

29:46.584 --> 29:47.336
Yeah.

30:06.336 --> 30:08.038
Pop, when's
that salt coming?

30:09.038 --> 30:11.474
It's on the way.

30:11.474 --> 30:14.178
When you gonna get me
one of them smart TVs

30:14.178 --> 30:15.247
so I can see
all your touchdowns?

30:16.247 --> 30:19.516
Maybe if you'd
stop gambling so much,
you can afford one yourself.

30:19.516 --> 30:21.484
What'd you say, son?

30:21.484 --> 30:24.188
Pop, you know I'm saving
my money for school.

30:24.188 --> 30:25.388
You need to tell
those recruiters

30:25.388 --> 30:28.224
to get you some cash
under the table.

30:28.224 --> 30:29.327
Or a Corvette.

30:30.327 --> 30:32.663
Yeah, you said that
a dozen times.

30:32.663 --> 30:35.132
It's a scholarship, Pop.
They're not gonna pay me.

30:35.132 --> 30:37.902
Look, I'm just trying
to help you get ahead.

30:37.902 --> 30:40.637
Don't be too proud
to take some advice
from your old man

30:40.637 --> 30:43.108
who's been there and done that.
You understand, son?

30:45.108 --> 30:46.012
Yes, sir.

30:51.448 --> 30:53.584
Pop, when are you gonna
get the faucet fixed?

30:53.584 --> 30:57.422
Can't afford it.
They cut back my hours
at the factory.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.990
But you can afford
Internet poker?

31:00.990 --> 31:04.095
Last time
they cut back my hours,
this hustle kept us afloat.

31:05.095 --> 31:07.964
Yeah, well, maybe you
could try, uh, blackjack.

31:07.964 --> 31:10.433
Statistically,
the odds are higher.

31:10.433 --> 31:13.171
Statistically.
Blackjack don't take no skill.

31:14.171 --> 31:17.375
Yeah, well,
you been losing more
than you've been winning.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.211
You got a great job
with a decent wage.

31:22.211 --> 31:25.211
You need to stop.

31:22.211 --> 31:25.452
You need to stay out
of my business.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.059
Kim. Come on in.

31:36.059 --> 31:38.628
Good to see you as usual.
How's school?

31:38.628 --> 31:40.263
It's good, sir. Thanks.

31:40.263 --> 31:42.601
Jordan, Kim stopped by.

31:44.601 --> 31:45.736
Hey.

31:45.736 --> 31:47.570
I, uh...

31:47.570 --> 31:49.306
brought you some salt.

31:49.306 --> 31:51.508
Yeah. Sorry to bother you
about that.

31:51.508 --> 31:53.076
It's no problem.

31:53.076 --> 31:56.713
It's not hard to walk 100 feet
down the sidewalk.

31:56.713 --> 31:58.083
Hmm.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.286
What were you doing up
so early the other day?

32:02.286 --> 32:04.387
Been working
at the Grove's farm.

32:04.387 --> 32:06.522
Yeah, that family's
been through it.

32:06.522 --> 32:09.759
Wife gets cancer.
Casey gets--

32:09.759 --> 32:10.063
Dad.

32:12.063 --> 32:14.298
All Jeff Grove's
radio station money
can't fix that.

32:14.298 --> 32:17.501
Just goes to show:
Tragedy shows
no favorites.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.506
His sister is in my grade.

32:22.506 --> 32:23.675
Were you helping her?

32:25.675 --> 32:27.644
Yeah. A little bit.

32:27.644 --> 32:28.114
Oh.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.651
Well, that's sweet of you.

32:34.651 --> 32:38.190
Uh... thanks for the salt.

32:40.190 --> 32:42.161
Anytime.

32:44.161 --> 32:45.161
Bye.

32:44.161 --> 32:45.151
Bye.

33:07.151 --> 33:10.154
Gotta get you in shape.
Pay attention to me.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.288
Ah. Get your butt in.

33:16.393 --> 33:17.230
Get up.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.567
Good boy.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.477
Good boy.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.346
Day one, right?

34:09.346 --> 34:10.550
Yeah.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.353
Hey, sorry I'm late.

34:17.353 --> 34:18.588
Don't worry about it.

34:18.588 --> 34:20.724
Uh, so, what do you
want me to do?

34:20.724 --> 34:23.860
Maybe you could get some hay
and get them ready to feed.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.860
Okay, sure.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.896
Okay, thanks.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.896
Yeah.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.565
Okay.

34:28.565 --> 34:31.371
About the other day?

34:34.371 --> 34:35.572
What about it?

34:36.572 --> 34:39.342
Uh, the kiss?

34:39.342 --> 34:40.679
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.250
I don't know,
I just wanted to bring it up

34:46.250 --> 34:48.284
so it didn't create
anything weird between us.

34:48.284 --> 34:51.355
Yeah, I could see
how that would, uh,
be kinda weird.

34:51.355 --> 34:55.393
I mean, I'm fine. But I just...
Yeah, that would be good.

34:56.393 --> 34:57.529
Uh...

34:58.529 --> 35:00.331
I don't even know
what that was.

35:01.331 --> 35:03.166
I don't know.
I mean, I know
you miss your brother.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.668
And maybe
I represent something.

35:04.668 --> 35:07.570
Or maybe you want to be
close to someone you know

35:07.570 --> 35:09.409
when you're sad, or...

35:12.409 --> 35:14.878
maybe it was for me.

35:15.878 --> 35:19.351
I'm pretty sure
it was just for you.

35:22.351 --> 35:25.322
Okay, that's good. Uh...

35:26.322 --> 35:29.295
It's all kind of
unexpected, I guess.

35:32.295 --> 35:35.264
All right, well, uh,
what do we do now?

35:35.264 --> 35:37.800
Should I just grab
the hay or...

35:37.800 --> 35:41.804
Yeah, and I guess I will
just wait for a chivalrous
young man like yourself

35:41.804 --> 35:44.875
to one day ask me out
on a date.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.945
Well, I'm not really sure
this chivalrous man
has the means

35:47.945 --> 35:50.813
to impress a fair lady
like yourself.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.949
I think he underestimates her.

35:52.949 --> 35:55.652
She is but a fair country girl
with simple taste.

35:56.652 --> 35:58.690
Well, if that's
the case...

35:59.690 --> 36:01.858
I shall no longer delay,
my fair maiden.

36:01.858 --> 36:05.695
Would you mind
joining me for dinner
in a fortnight's time?

36:05.695 --> 36:08.695
Two weeks from now?

36:05.695 --> 36:08.898
No I just like
the word "fortnight."

36:08.898 --> 36:09.900
Okay.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.869
What about this weekend?

36:13.869 --> 36:15.706
I would be delighted.

36:16.706 --> 36:20.309
Jordan Bishop.
What is going on?

36:20.309 --> 36:22.311
When did this happen,
and why did I not know
about this?

36:22.311 --> 36:24.347
Okay, it literally came
out of nowhere.

36:24.347 --> 36:27.018
And he's just so smart
and solid and sweet...

36:28.018 --> 36:29.686
And in college!

36:29.686 --> 36:31.355
Yeah. Isn't that weird?

36:31.355 --> 36:32.023
He works the front desk
at my gym.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.291
Yeah, weekends.

36:34.291 --> 36:35.992
And he's...

36:35.992 --> 36:37.992
African-American?

36:35.992 --> 36:37.860
Yes.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.630
Oh, really?
I had no idea.

36:40.630 --> 36:44.670
This is blowing my mind.
I gotta sit down.

36:47.670 --> 36:49.972
Morgan isn't going
to be happy.

36:49.972 --> 36:52.478
Please.
Morgan couldn't care less.

36:54.478 --> 36:58.047
Are you sure you're ready
for the racial drama?
I had a friend--

36:58.047 --> 37:01.050
It'll be fine.
It's not like we're
in the 1960s.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.918
We've had
a black president.

37:02.918 --> 37:05.054
Everyone is all progressive
and everything now.

37:05.054 --> 37:06.625
Okay, whatever.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.529
So, when is he
taking you out?

37:12.529 --> 37:13.409
Friday night.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.376
Wow.

37:29.813 --> 37:31.847
Well, you look
very dapper yourself.

37:31.847 --> 37:33.351
Thank you.

37:34.351 --> 37:36.521
Join me for an evening stroll,
my lady?

37:37.521 --> 37:39.956
Are you gonna tell me
why I wasn't allowed
in the barn all afternoon?

37:39.956 --> 37:42.434
Ah, patience,
my fair maiden.

37:51.434 --> 37:53.603
We got the only reservation
in town.

37:57.007 --> 38:00.077
You might want
to wait until
you taste the food.

38:01.077 --> 38:02.012
So, he plays football
and cooks.

38:03.012 --> 38:07.717
Well, I guess
you pick up a few things

38:07.717 --> 38:09.456
when you grow up
without a mom.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.458
My dad never saw you do
any of this?

38:15.458 --> 38:16.427
Nope.

38:17.427 --> 38:19.429
Why doesn't he ever
come down here?

38:20.429 --> 38:22.465
He bought this whole place
for my mom.

38:22.465 --> 38:24.067
I think the horses
remind him of her,

38:24.067 --> 38:27.972
so he hasn't come
down to the barn
since she died.

38:29.972 --> 38:32.809
Well, it could be worse,
given what he's been through.

38:33.809 --> 38:35.809
He's a good man.

38:33.809 --> 38:35.878
Yeah.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.117
You just don't see it
too much these days.

38:40.117 --> 38:43.489
I remember all his speeches
about being a man
of distinction.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.125
They were kinda cheesy,
but it worked.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.827
It got me thinking. You know?
It made a difference.

38:50.827 --> 38:54.463
Really? Well,
then you need to tell me:

38:54.463 --> 38:56.934
What are your plans to be
a man of distinction?

38:57.934 --> 39:00.570
Well, I start at a new college
in six months.

39:00.570 --> 39:03.840
I'll be there for two years,
finish my undergrad in business.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.510
Then, Lord willing,
I'll go to the pros.

39:06.510 --> 39:11.148
But the average career
only lasts 3.3 years,
statistically speaking.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.483
Wow, you must love
statistics.

39:14.483 --> 39:16.585
Numbers are everything.

39:16.585 --> 39:19.088
After my 3.3 years,
I'll save that money

39:19.088 --> 39:21.657
and go back and get my MBA.
Avoid debt.

39:21.657 --> 39:24.960
Probably get an executive job,
work my way up
the corporate ladder

39:24.960 --> 39:27.898
to some executive suite.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.932
Very impressive.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.204
So, where did
all that come from?

39:34.204 --> 39:36.041
All my pop ever wanted to do
was gamble.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.110
I don't want to be like that.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.815
Gonna be the first person
in my family to earn a degree.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.949
Only 56% of students finish.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.952
Statistically speaking?

39:48.952 --> 39:50.219
Exactly.

39:50.219 --> 39:54.630
Well, a toast.
To big dreams.

40:01.630 --> 40:05.635
As a dreamer,
somebody who's always
looking to the future,

40:05.635 --> 40:08.237
it's kind of hard
to ignore the fact
that you're leaving in May

40:08.237 --> 40:10.106
and I'm leaving
in August, right?

40:11.106 --> 40:12.510
It's only our first date.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.146
True.

40:17.146 --> 40:19.949
Uh, are you hungry
for dessert?

40:19.949 --> 40:21.952
Always.

40:21.952 --> 40:23.519
Well, we're gonna have
to go to the store

40:23.519 --> 40:25.755
because I might have given
all the ice cream

40:25.755 --> 40:26.190
to Cody and Chief.

40:28.190 --> 40:30.867
You didn't.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.003
Hey, I'll be right in.
I just gotta respond
to Brook.

40:40.003 --> 40:41.938
Something with
mint chocolate?

40:41.938 --> 40:43.034
Of course.

41:17.072 --> 41:18.309
Hey, did you get it?

41:20.309 --> 41:21.311
What's up?

41:21.311 --> 41:23.916
The store owner
is following me.

41:26.916 --> 41:28.052
No, he's just checking
inventory.

41:29.052 --> 41:31.954
Stay here. Watch this.

41:31.954 --> 41:33.871
Okay.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.873
Oh, my gosh.
You're totally right.

41:50.873 --> 41:52.275
What's his problem?

41:52.275 --> 41:53.943
It happens all the time.

41:53.943 --> 41:56.347
Look, don't worry about it.
Don't let it ruin our date.

41:57.347 --> 41:59.050
No. We have
to do something.

42:01.050 --> 42:02.818
Come on.

42:02.818 --> 42:04.688
Okay. If you want to.

42:04.688 --> 42:05.190
Let's go.

42:08.190 --> 42:11.094
Hey, sir,
were you following me
because I'm a male?

42:11.094 --> 42:13.094
Uh, I'm not--

42:11.094 --> 42:13.096
Let me give you a tip.

42:13.096 --> 42:14.597
So, I attend
the local college

42:14.597 --> 42:16.266
where I'm taking
Sociology 210.

42:16.266 --> 42:18.668
And there I'm learning
that women are more likely

42:18.668 --> 42:20.302
to engage in retail theft
than men.

42:20.302 --> 42:21.371
Statistically speaking.

42:22.371 --> 42:25.742
I didn't mention any stats,
but it's at 4% and rising.

42:25.742 --> 42:27.210
Really? That much.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.244
Yeah. Read it in
a scientific journal.

42:29.244 --> 42:30.614
Wow, that's fascinating.

42:31.614 --> 42:36.119
I thought so myself.
So you should probably
follow her next time.

42:36.119 --> 42:37.755
Probably so.

42:38.755 --> 42:42.226
Now, I would love
to purchase these items.

42:43.226 --> 42:45.226
You can take them.
I don't--

42:43.226 --> 42:45.894
No. I want to pay.

42:45.894 --> 42:48.099
Like everybody else.
I don't need any
special treatment.

42:49.099 --> 42:52.170
Okay. All right.
I'll ring them up for you
behind the counter.

42:55.672 --> 42:59.041
Is that what
it's always gonna be like?

42:59.041 --> 43:03.813
That's probably
as easy as it gets.

43:04.813 --> 43:06.083
You down for this?

43:07.083 --> 43:08.418
100%.

43:09.418 --> 43:11.824
So, here's how you throw it.
All right?

43:15.824 --> 43:18.028
Okay. The wind
caught and moved the ball.

44:24.327 --> 44:26.295
Oh, yes. My dance.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.295
You gotta spike this.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.398
Oh, yeah.

44:28.398 --> 44:29.501
Boom!

Thank you.

44:59.161 --> 45:00.396
Thanks.

45:00.396 --> 45:03.233
I love this place.
Everything here is good.

45:03.233 --> 45:05.101
Hey.

45:06.101 --> 45:08.306
Have you ever thought about,
after your trip,
just staying out West?

45:10.306 --> 45:11.275
Being in LA with me?

45:13.275 --> 45:15.978
You wanted to do
something big.

45:15.978 --> 45:17.548
Yeah, I'd love to.

45:19.548 --> 45:21.550
But I mean, I never thought
I'd be the kind of girl

45:21.550 --> 45:25.054
that'd chase a guy
across the country.

45:25.054 --> 45:30.360
And it's really just
not something I can
think about, you know?

45:31.360 --> 45:33.362
It's really just
not a good time.

45:33.362 --> 45:35.465
I'm so behind
in my training as it is,

45:35.465 --> 45:37.934
and my dad
is still a wreck.

45:37.934 --> 45:39.902
Hey, did you ever tell
your dad about me?

45:39.902 --> 45:40.969
Yeah.

45:40.969 --> 45:42.206
You did?

45:43.206 --> 45:46.043
No, no. I...
No, I didn't.

45:47.043 --> 45:48.913
Are you listening?

45:55.918 --> 45:57.454
Have they been staring
the whole time?

45:59.454 --> 46:00.590
Yes.

46:00.590 --> 46:03.460
Well, can't you just
look at me?

46:05.460 --> 46:08.501
We'll make our own
little world right here.

46:12.501 --> 46:13.304
Okay.

46:17.072 --> 46:19.077
So, uh,
did you tell your dad?

46:21.077 --> 46:22.344
I've been thinking
about it.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.112
But it's not really
a great time,

46:24.112 --> 46:26.954
just with everything
that's been going on
at home and...

46:31.954 --> 46:32.862
Jordan?

46:42.565 --> 46:44.936
Can we just get out of here?

46:46.936 --> 46:49.978
I don't want to sit here
watching people stare at us
all night.

46:55.978 --> 46:57.126
Sure.

47:21.971 --> 47:24.373
Hi. Uh, Kim, right?

47:24.373 --> 47:26.373
Yes. We had math
freshman year.

47:24.373 --> 47:26.543
I remember.

47:27.543 --> 47:30.543
What's up?

47:27.543 --> 47:30.547
Have you even thought
about what you're doing?

47:32.547 --> 47:35.117
Maybe you're not
as woke as I thought.

47:35.117 --> 47:37.987
I'm sorry?

47:37.987 --> 47:40.423
You know, girls like me
don't have a lot of options
around here.

47:41.423 --> 47:43.226
You could have any guy
you want,

47:43.226 --> 47:46.329
but you wanna chase
the one good guy
in my neighborhood.

47:46.329 --> 47:47.996
So if you're trying to ease
your white guilt

47:47.996 --> 47:51.567
or be all progressive
or whatever,

47:51.567 --> 47:53.375
you just know
you're making it worse.

47:59.375 --> 48:00.878
What was that about?

48:01.878 --> 48:05.878
Uh, she just wanted
something for class.

48:01.878 --> 48:05.681
You have class with her?

48:05.681 --> 48:08.717
All right,
so I got the big show
tomorrow night.

48:08.717 --> 48:11.721
-Will I see you both there?
-Yeah. Totally.

48:11.721 --> 48:13.356
Yeah? And what
about you, Lee?

48:14.356 --> 48:16.626
Uh, I don't know, Morgan.

48:17.626 --> 48:19.197
Well, I'll make sure
you have a good time.

48:21.197 --> 48:23.166
Hopefully I'll see
y'all there.

48:23.166 --> 48:24.302
I'll shoot you
the address.

48:26.302 --> 48:30.139
Come on, Lee. You have to take
some time to have some fun.

48:31.139 --> 48:33.114
It's our last few months
of high school.

48:38.114 --> 48:41.416
Okay. Okay.

48:59.268 --> 49:01.170
Up next we've got
Edge of Reality.

49:01.170 --> 49:03.340
Let's give them
a big round of
applause, guys.

49:04.340 --> 49:05.175
He's good.

49:07.175 --> 49:09.175
He's okay.

49:07.175 --> 49:09.711
Look at this.

49:09.711 --> 49:13.081
Lee has finally
graced me with that
beautiful presence.

49:13.081 --> 49:16.152
You know,
I'm out all the time working.

49:16.152 --> 49:18.788
Just not with you anymore.

49:18.788 --> 49:21.057
Maybe we should change that.

49:22.057 --> 49:23.726
Where's Jordan at?

49:23.726 --> 49:25.094
He is with Kyle and Paul.

49:26.094 --> 49:28.530
He finally let you
off your leash?

49:28.530 --> 49:30.599
Jordan doesn't have me
on any leash.

49:30.599 --> 49:32.402
Good to know.

49:33.402 --> 49:36.340
Well, maybe I could
pick you up tomorrow night
and take you out?

49:37.340 --> 49:40.143
So we can catch up
and talk about
what happened last summer.

49:41.143 --> 49:42.047
Just give me a chance.

49:44.047 --> 49:45.815
No, thanks.

49:45.815 --> 49:47.418
Coffee?

49:48.418 --> 49:50.755
I have a boyfriend now,
Morgan.

49:53.755 --> 49:55.425
I didn't realize you guys
were that serious.

49:56.425 --> 49:59.264
I figured you were
just experimenting,
you know, since he's...

50:07.170 --> 50:08.503
Lee.

50:08.503 --> 50:11.074
It's not a big deal.
He didn't know.

50:11.074 --> 50:13.677
Are you seriously
taking his side?

50:14.677 --> 50:18.847
Look. I tried to tell you
this would be hard.

50:18.847 --> 50:20.516
You didn't want to listen.

50:21.516 --> 50:23.456
Yeah. I can't deal with this
right now.

50:27.456 --> 50:30.594
Jordan, will you please
take me home?

50:31.594 --> 50:32.862
You all right?

50:32.862 --> 50:34.831
Yeah, uh...

50:34.831 --> 50:36.467
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

50:37.467 --> 50:38.668
What do you mean?

50:39.668 --> 50:42.706
Like, you and me.
Are you sure that
this is okay?

50:43.706 --> 50:47.177
Yes. Definitely.

50:48.177 --> 50:49.012
Okay.

50:50.012 --> 50:51.880
I think you've had
too many 5:30 a.m. mornings.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.250
Yeah,
you're probably right.

50:54.250 --> 50:56.519
I haven't had
nearly enough time
to prep the horses.

50:57.519 --> 51:01.690
But I think it'll be okay
as long as I don't have
anymore distractions.

51:01.690 --> 51:04.146
Oh, well, don't let me
stand in your way.

51:23.146 --> 51:24.614
Hey.

51:24.614 --> 51:26.414
Hey. What are you doing?

51:26.414 --> 51:31.554
Well, um, I kinda
need some help with
my science project.

51:31.554 --> 51:34.157
It's due tomorrow,
and there's no foam core.

51:35.157 --> 51:36.793
Why are you just
telling me this now?

51:37.793 --> 51:40.697
'Cause I just
thought of it now.

51:41.697 --> 51:43.666
And what,
did you think the foam core

51:43.666 --> 51:45.934
was just gonna fall
out of the sky?

51:45.934 --> 51:48.405
No, I thought you'd
drive me to the store.

51:50.405 --> 51:51.476
Dad's gone.

51:54.476 --> 51:55.279
Okay.

51:56.279 --> 51:57.780
Yeah, let's go.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.349
You know,
I'm a little hungry, too.

52:00.349 --> 52:03.351
So now I'm your driver
and your cook?

52:03.351 --> 52:05.922
Yeah. You're the best.

52:05.922 --> 52:07.856
Uh-huh. All right,
you're just saying that

52:07.856 --> 52:10.306
because you want me to do
your science fair project
for you.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.875
I can't believe
I finally did that.

52:28.710 --> 52:31.746
Dad. What are you
doing out here?

52:31.746 --> 52:33.782
What's up, Mr. Grove?

52:41.590 --> 52:43.858
-Oh.
-Dad.

52:43.858 --> 52:45.927
That's amazing.

52:45.927 --> 52:47.663
That thing
looks brand new.

52:47.663 --> 52:50.501
Well, then why don't
you two take her out
for a spin tonight?

52:52.501 --> 52:53.702
No. That's okay.

52:53.702 --> 52:55.271
Why not? Cars are
meant to be driven.

52:56.271 --> 52:59.775
Go. Go ahead.
You were gonna go
to co-op for me anyway.

52:59.775 --> 53:01.010
You... You're not gonna
come with me?

53:02.010 --> 53:05.313
No. I've got
so much training to do
and I'm so behind.

53:05.313 --> 53:07.617
But you should go
and have fun.

53:08.617 --> 53:09.753
You sure, Mr. Grove?

53:11.753 --> 53:13.324
This car was supposed
to be for Casey.

53:16.324 --> 53:18.369
I'm sure he'd want you
to drive it first.

53:26.369 --> 53:29.605
Hey. Just go drive
the doggone thing.

54:02.605 --> 54:04.739
Hey, do you want
a granola bar?

54:04.739 --> 54:08.612
Right? I know I'm a sucker.
I know. Don't tell Jordan.

54:09.612 --> 54:10.327
Don't tell him.

54:38.606 --> 54:39.809
Hey.

54:40.809 --> 54:41.844
You work here?

54:42.844 --> 54:44.447
For about the last two months.

54:45.447 --> 54:46.748
Can I help you?

54:46.748 --> 54:48.918
Nah, I'm just looking.

54:48.918 --> 54:52.588
Are you sure?
You been looking at those.

54:53.588 --> 54:54.856
They're pretty cool.

54:54.856 --> 54:57.661
Especially for someone
who likes horses.

54:58.661 --> 55:01.998
Yeah, I can see that.

55:03.998 --> 55:05.168
I...

55:06.168 --> 55:08.003
I wonder if someone like that
would really understand

55:09.003 --> 55:12.911
what you've been through
as a black man.

55:15.911 --> 55:17.813
Should I ask someone else
to help me or...

55:18.813 --> 55:24.059
No, I just like
to educate my customers
on their purchases.

55:30.059 --> 55:33.074
-Can I take a look
 at that one?
-Yeah.

55:46.074 --> 55:47.577
Morgan.

55:48.577 --> 55:51.112
Well, I guess you give a brother
a scholarship to a D1 school

55:51.112 --> 55:53.581
and they just give him
anything he wants now, huh?

55:53.581 --> 55:56.885
Classic Benz. It's nice.

55:56.885 --> 55:59.954
-Yeah, let's not lean
 on the car.
-Sure, man. You know what?

55:59.954 --> 56:01.923
Let me get the smudge off
for you real quick.

56:01.923 --> 56:03.659
Hey, man. I'm serious.
Back away from the car.

56:03.659 --> 56:06.429
What? You're not gonna offer
your boys a ride?

56:07.429 --> 56:09.965
In this really, really...
What do they call it
in your neighborhood?

56:09.965 --> 56:11.534
Swag, right?

56:11.534 --> 56:14.471
We'd love to see how
a swag car this good drives.

56:15.471 --> 56:16.572
Not now. I'm late.

56:16.572 --> 56:18.844
What you rushing off for?
Got a date with Lee tonight?

56:21.844 --> 56:23.144
You know, what does
she see in you?

56:23.144 --> 56:24.713
Morgan, I'm serious. Move.

56:25.713 --> 56:28.083
You want to know why
you got the better
scholarship?

56:29.083 --> 56:31.820
Affirmative action.
Yeah, that's right.

56:31.820 --> 56:33.655
I had similar numbers
to you this year.

56:33.655 --> 56:36.826
That's the only reason
why you're ever
gonna get anything.

56:36.826 --> 56:40.599
That's funny.
I would've thought it was
because you were no good.

56:53.608 --> 56:55.244
Dude, dude,
we gotta go!

56:55.244 --> 56:56.818
Dude! Dude!

57:12.527 --> 57:15.273
Dad? What? I'm right
in the middle of something.

57:25.273 --> 57:28.277
My son was just
looking at that car
when that thug attacked him.

57:28.277 --> 57:30.612
Dad, it's just
a fractured wrist.
It's really nothing.

57:30.612 --> 57:32.983
It could've been
your throwing arm.

57:33.983 --> 57:36.518
Hi. What room
is Jordan Bishop in?

57:36.518 --> 57:38.518
240.

57:36.518 --> 57:38.853
240. Thank you.

57:51.534 --> 57:52.909
I'm here, Jordan.

57:59.909 --> 58:01.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:02.777 --> 58:04.847
Let's just give her
a little time alone, okay?

58:04.847 --> 58:06.782
Is he gonna be
all right?

58:06.782 --> 58:09.327
I don't know.
Let's go see if we can
get some answers. Come on.

58:23.331 --> 58:24.266
Nurse?

58:25.266 --> 58:27.266
Nurse! He's waking up.

58:27.702 --> 58:29.639
Are you okay?

58:30.639 --> 58:32.041
What happened?

58:32.041 --> 58:33.108
Let's see.

58:33.108 --> 58:34.043
Oh, my head.

58:35.043 --> 58:38.813
Hey. Yeah, I just wanna
let you know he, uh...

58:38.813 --> 58:40.849
he has a concussion.

58:40.849 --> 58:43.152
But, um, something's
going on with his knee.
I'm not exactly sure what.

58:43.152 --> 58:45.253
Excuse me, Mr. Grove?

58:45.253 --> 58:47.724
Hey, Thomas, let me
call you right back.

58:48.724 --> 58:50.893
Hi, Officer.

58:50.893 --> 58:52.760
Mr. Wallace,
the other boy's father,

58:52.760 --> 58:55.132
said you may be wanting to file
a grand theft auto charge?

58:57.132 --> 58:58.467
What are you talking about?

58:59.467 --> 59:01.904
Well, your Mercedes
was at the scene,
and the suspect--

59:01.904 --> 59:03.239
Are you talking about...

59:04.239 --> 59:05.240
Are you talking
about Jordan Bishop?

59:06.240 --> 59:09.110
Yes, Mr. Bishop
was driving it.

59:09.110 --> 59:10.646
Mr. Bishop
was driving the car

59:10.646 --> 59:13.384
because I gave Mr. Bishop
the keys.

59:15.384 --> 59:16.018
Officer, do you have
anything else?

59:17.018 --> 59:18.353
If not, I'd like to call
the boy's father.

59:18.353 --> 59:20.989
No, Mr. Grove.
I was just following up

59:20.989 --> 59:22.824
for Mr. Wallace's information.
That's all.

59:22.824 --> 59:24.094
Thank you.
Have a good day.

59:25.094 --> 59:26.965
Good night.

59:30.965 --> 59:32.670
Hey, Thomas.
Sorry about that.

59:41.710 --> 59:43.847
How is he?

59:44.847 --> 59:47.750
He's good.
The doctors just finished
checking him over.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.186
So he's sleeping.

59:51.186 --> 59:53.186
Is his dad coming?

59:51.186 --> 59:53.023
He's working
the double shift.

59:54.023 --> 59:56.393
He's gonna come
in the morning.
We should stay with him.

59:57.393 --> 59:59.161
Where's, uh...
Where's Logan?

59:59.161 --> 00:00.295
Uh, he crashed
in Jordan's room.

01:00:01.295 --> 01:00:03.295
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

01:00:01.295 --> 01:00:03.737
Okay.

01:00:08.737 --> 01:00:12.940
So, um, how are you?

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.786
Hmm. I've been better.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:28.757
You know, I, uh,
kinda connected the dots.

01:00:28.757 --> 01:00:29.994
What do you mean?

01:00:31.994 --> 01:00:33.329
Between you and Jordan.

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:36.201
You're obviously
more than friends.

01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:41.072
Why would you keep that
a secret from me?

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:44.340
I was gonna tell you.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.414
But it's not like
you're ever around.

01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:54.884
Besides, I knew
you'd be angry.

01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:59.358
So that's what
you think of me?

01:01:03.358 --> 01:01:05.340
Everybody else seems to have
a problem with it.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.344
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:24.246
I was worried you'd be upset...

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:29.492
because he was
Casey's best friend.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.994
Well, one good thing
about your big brother:

01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:43.208
He... He always was
a good judge of character.

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:57.045
Hey, it's late.
Just go get Logan,

01:01:57.045 --> 01:01:59.414
and maybe Brooklyn
will give you
a ride home. All right?

01:01:59.414 --> 01:02:00.416
Maybe she'll even
stay the night.

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:03.521
I'll stay here.
He's gonna be fine.

01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:07.922
Okay.

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:09.123
Get outta here. Go.

01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:10.233
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:20.139
Mr. Bishop?

01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:26.275
Here's what we have.

01:02:27.275 --> 01:02:31.346
The MRI shows that you have
a tear in your ACL.

01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:33.114
Now, I don't think
you'll have to have surgery,

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:38.152
but you're gonna have to undergo
some intensive physical therapy
once the swelling goes down.

01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:41.923
It'll recover in a few months
if you take care of it.

01:02:41.923 --> 01:02:42.025
Okay, good.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:47.197
But what I'm most concerned
about is your concussion.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:52.067
The CT scan shows
some internal bleeding
and some signs of scar tissue

01:02:52.067 --> 01:02:55.204
which may have been
from a previous concussion.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.172
Probably from
playing football.

01:02:57.172 --> 01:02:58.076
You don't want to have
more than three.

01:03:01.076 --> 01:03:02.478
So, I can play ball?

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:05.347
Uh, it's tough to say.

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:09.518
Worst case,
with a few more bad hits,

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:11.920
and you could wind up with CTE,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.291
which could lead
to mental breakdowns,

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.463
erratic behavior,
premature dementia.

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:27.237
The only way I have
of paying for college
is that football scholarship.

01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:31.074
So, what am I
supposed to do, Doc?

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:36.646
I'm, um... I'm sorry.
I can't answer that.

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:39.420
Only you can make
that decision.

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:59.905
Folks come back from torn ACLs.
Happens all the time.

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:06.041
My knee is gonna heal.
It's my head
I'm worried about.

01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:08.911
Oh, them doctors don't know
what they're talking about.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:11.146
You're a Bishop.
You're built like a brick.

01:04:11.146 --> 01:04:14.516
With some hard work,
you can get back on that field.

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:17.686
Pop, I love football.
But this isn't about that.

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:21.557
It's about everything else
I want to accomplish in life.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:27.932
-One more blow--
-You can't afford college
 without that scholarship.

01:04:30.932 --> 01:04:32.068
Look, son...

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.304
you're really good.

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.340
You got a chance
to play on Sunday.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.443
And get paid.

01:04:41.443 --> 01:04:43.045
Is it worth me risking
my brain?

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.947
No risk, no reward.

01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:49.585
Look, you either man up
and show 'em you still got
what it takes, or...

01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:55.590
well, I can probably
get you some work down
at the factory.

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.458
No, I don't want to work
at the factory.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.161
You think you're too good
to work at the factory.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.262
You think you're better
than your old man?

01:05:01.262 --> 01:05:02.601
No, no, no.

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:08.369
I just got other dreams.

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:10.137
Yeah, you're a sharp kid.

01:05:10.137 --> 01:05:12.641
In ten years or so,
you could work your way
up to supervisor,

01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:14.077
make a pretty good wage.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.081
Mm-hmm.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.717
No, I'm gonna
get some loans.
Pay for it myself.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.119
Nah, nah.
See, that's exactly what
the government wants.

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:25.619
Get you 150 grand in debt.

01:05:25.619 --> 01:05:28.090
Take you 25 years
of working for the man
to pay it off.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.460
It's all over TV.
College ain't worth
that kind of debt.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.463
Well, I started it.
I gotta finish it.

01:05:35.463 --> 01:05:40.501
Then you best get back out
on that field and pretend
like nothing happened.

01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:43.197
I would have had the money
if you hadn't gambled
it all away.

01:07:12.693 --> 01:07:15.364
Hey, babe. How are you?

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:19.768
I'm glad you're here.
You don't have to stay long.

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:21.436
I know you got horses
to train.

01:07:22.436 --> 01:07:23.605
There's nowhere
I'd rather be.

01:07:23.605 --> 01:07:26.605
That's my girl.

01:07:26.775 --> 01:07:29.577
I may have to take
some time off my job
at the farm.

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:31.545
I will talk
to management

01:07:31.545 --> 01:07:33.481
and see if I can get it
approved, okay?

01:07:35.717 --> 01:07:37.621
Oh, hey,
how's your concussion?

01:07:39.621 --> 01:07:42.157
Doctor says it's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

01:07:43.157 --> 01:07:45.260
Good. That could've been
the end of football for you.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.498
I'm just ready to get back
and start rehabbing.

01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:52.835
I think I can get back
by the fall.

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:55.871
I don't have all the money
I need for PT,

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:59.675
but maybe I can watch
some videos online or something.

01:08:00.675 --> 01:08:02.711
We'll figure it out.

01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:06.215
Can I hire that girl with
the bad knee on the horse?

01:08:07.215 --> 01:08:10.351
Um, I think she's
a little busy with
sixth grade homework.

01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:12.654
But I think
I could do it.

01:08:12.654 --> 01:08:14.889
I mean, I remember
everything that we did.

01:08:14.889 --> 01:08:18.292
No, no. You've done enough.
Your plate's full.

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:20.729
No. This is your dream.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.796
Football's
the start of it.

01:08:23.796 --> 01:08:25.399
Look, I can push my trip
back to the fall.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.399
I'm way behind
in my training as it is.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.801
No, no.

01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:29.474
No, you're not doing that.

01:08:32.474 --> 01:08:35.645
Your broken dreams
are worth putting
back together.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:40.747
Yeah. They are.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:43.618
Besides, I gotta get you
back to playing wingman.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.554
It's wingback,
you wing nut.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.493
Okay.

01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:59.501
You know, my dad's
gonna be home soon.

01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:02.671
Um, you might want
to take off.

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:07.609
I just... I just
don't feel like dealing
with all that today.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:08.412
Yeah. I get it.

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:13.515
But, hey, at least
you're gonna finally
ride a horse.

01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:18.752
I don't know what's worse,
a stinky horse or a bad knee
for the rest of my life.

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:21.389
Okay,
you are definitely
a horse-ist.

01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:27.595
What are you
laughing at?

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:29.465
You.

01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:31.765
I don't know about this.

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:33.435
Come on.
What's the matter?

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.970
Me falling off.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.970
Come on. I thought you said
you weren't scared.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.340
Well, I lied.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.609
All right. Come on.
Just get ready.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.710
On three, okay?

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:44.710
All right.

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:44.546
One, two...

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.018
What are you doing?
Looking for your seat belt?

01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:52.487
Oh, okay.
You got jokes, huh?

01:09:52.487 --> 01:09:54.622
What, are three people
gonna see that on there?

01:09:54.622 --> 01:09:55.560
It's 12.

01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:03.797
All right.
Don't be afraid, Jordan.
I got you. Come on.

01:10:03.797 --> 01:10:05.797
Whoa.

01:10:03.797 --> 01:10:05.742
Just hold on.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:15.042
I don't know about this.

01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:16.578
Come on.
It's easy.

01:10:17.578 --> 01:10:19.280
Okay, so, when you ride,

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.815
every muscle in your legs
are gonna be worked.

01:10:21.815 --> 01:10:23.019
It's gonna
slowly break through
the scar tissue

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.756
that's limiting
your mobility.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:28.024
You sure old Chief
is ready for this?

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.761
Oh, trust me.
He's loving it. I promise.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.929
All right. Let's go.

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:37.832
Uh... Okay.

01:10:37.832 --> 01:10:39.735
-Come on.
-Come on.

01:10:41.735 --> 01:10:43.070
I'm a regular
old cowboy now.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:45.907
See? Much more fun
than PT.

01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:47.009
Plus, the view
is better.

01:10:48.009 --> 01:10:49.811
The view is outstanding.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:52.811
There we go!

Okay, I did.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:50.877
Hey, look. I got you something
for helping me out with my knee.

01:11:57.612 --> 01:12:00.414
It's a compass.
You can wear it around
your neck on your trip.

01:12:00.414 --> 01:12:02.884
Just in case you don't know
which way to go.

01:12:02.884 --> 01:12:04.921
Thank you.

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:09.391
Giving jewelry
is pretty serious, right?

01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:12.661
Well, I did work
pretty hard for it.

01:12:13.661 --> 01:12:16.632
So, I guess this means
it's finally time
to meet your dad?

01:12:18.632 --> 01:12:21.168
I don't know.
He's not too happy
about me bringing up

01:12:21.168 --> 01:12:23.506
how he gambled away
my college money.

01:12:25.506 --> 01:12:26.009
Oh.

01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:30.011
It's just not
the right time.

01:12:31.011 --> 01:12:32.948
It's never a good time.

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:35.083
I can't do anything
about that.

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.186
We're from two
different worlds.

01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:43.595
But I thought we were
gonna make our own
little world.

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:48.530
I'll see what I can do.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:50.932
Okay.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:53.932
Hey, Pop.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:53.940
Hey.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.710
You smell like a barn.

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.979
You've been spending
an awful lot of time
at the Grove's place.

01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:08.682
Yeah. They're helping me out
with my knee.

01:13:08.682 --> 01:13:10.854
They, or that girl?

01:13:12.854 --> 01:13:14.222
Don't start with me, Pop.

01:13:15.222 --> 01:13:17.560
Oh, so, you got you
a white girlfriend now.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.030
I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Lee.

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:24.865
And I don't care about
the color of her skin.

01:13:24.865 --> 01:13:28.703
Well, I guarantee
she cares about
the color of your skin.

01:13:28.703 --> 01:13:31.739
Trust me. I've been
around this town too long.

01:13:32.739 --> 01:13:34.009
People are talking, Jordan,
about who did this

01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:37.514
and who did what between you
and them white boys.

01:13:39.514 --> 01:13:41.514
Well, Lee's different.

01:13:39.514 --> 01:13:41.916
She's no different.

01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:45.752
You think you're special?
You think she's gonna want
a future with you

01:13:45.752 --> 01:13:48.257
if can't play football,
if you can't afford school?

01:13:50.257 --> 01:13:52.094
You haven't even
told her, have you?

01:13:53.094 --> 01:13:54.929
I didn't think so.

01:13:54.929 --> 01:13:57.899
The second you don't have
some flashy future,
she's gonna drop you.

01:13:57.899 --> 01:14:01.502
You'll see.
She's got money, son.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:05.773
But she ain't gonna
wanna be with nobody
can't pay for her horses.

01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:08.773
That's just the way it is.

01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:08.510
You don't even know her.

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.578
Because you're ashamed
to bring her around
your old man,

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:12.212
because you figure
if she knows your roots,

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:14.149
she might not stick around.

01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:18.686
-I'll bring her by, then.
-All right, you do that.

01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:23.686
I'm sure she's a...
she's a nice young lady.

01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:23.157
Yes, she is.

01:14:23.157 --> 01:14:25.029
But she's gonna
break your heart.

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:29.269
She's not Mom.

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.871
I'm just trying
to look out for you, son.

01:14:36.871 --> 01:14:39.908
You're from
separate worlds.

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.966
Ain't no future
for the two of you.

01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:09.703
Looks like Jordan's all better.
Time to get back to work.

01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:42.337
See, whenever
you're steering him,

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.204
if you want him
to go this way,

01:15:44.204 --> 01:15:46.341
you want to pull back
towards your hip.

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:49.243
Just like that.
You never cross over his neck.

01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:51.078
So, bring him around
this way.

01:15:51.078 --> 01:15:52.880
Good. Now loosen up.

01:16:07.028 --> 01:16:12.220
Historians have
traditionally divided the war
into three phases.

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.689
-Hey. You need any help?
-Hey.

01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:37.925
Yeah. Uh, maybe
you could grab a brush.

01:16:37.925 --> 01:16:40.925
I need to get ready
for school pretty soon.

01:16:37.925 --> 01:16:40.332
Yeah.

01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:48.872
Oh, yeah.
You like that, huh, boy?

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.041
You look tired.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.010
Just what every woman
loves to hear.

01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:58.078
I just worry about you.

01:16:58.078 --> 01:16:59.783
You know,
you've been pushing hard.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.989
That's what you have to do
to accomplish your dreams.

01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:10.094
How you doing, Chief?

01:17:13.094 --> 01:17:14.434
You miss your buddy,
don't you?

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:24.738
Hey, Lee, have you ever
really grieved Casey's death?

01:17:24.738 --> 01:17:25.474
Yeah. Of course.

01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:29.476
It just seems like
ever since it all happened,

01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:31.476
you've just been
running ragged, you know?

01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:31.912
I'm fine, Jordan.

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:34.850
I don't know why you always
keep bringing it up.

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:38.056
Okay. Never mind.

01:17:43.056 --> 01:17:44.760
Prom's coming up, right?

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.461
Guess so.

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:48.261
Do I, like, have to go to that?

01:17:48.261 --> 01:17:51.432
Or am I too old?
Will they let me in?

01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:55.802
I've never really cared
too much about prom, so...

01:17:55.802 --> 01:17:57.240
Okay, good.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.844
I know it doesn't compare...

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:05.149
but I was thinking
I could invite you over
for dinner with my father.

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:11.149
Really?

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:11.386
Yeah. I think I'm ready.

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:14.523
I don't know
what'll happen, but...

01:18:15.523 --> 01:18:18.395
I just want him to realize
that we're different.

01:18:21.395 --> 01:18:22.430
I'm sure I'll love him.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:26.403
And I can make him
love me.

01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:31.140
Come on, come on.
Keep up, keep up!

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.480
Uh-uh. Careful.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.984
Good boy.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.421
Easy. Good boy.

01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:49.297
One more time. Come on.

01:18:59.533 --> 01:19:01.805
Looks like you've been
training those horses hard.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:04.876
Yep.

01:19:08.876 --> 01:19:10.378
You still planning
on doing that trip?

01:19:11.378 --> 01:19:13.914
Probably have to delay
a month or so,

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:16.454
but, yeah, I am.

01:19:21.454 --> 01:19:23.257
You still gonna
ride it alone?

01:19:24.257 --> 01:19:25.363
Sure am.

01:19:30.363 --> 01:19:33.167
You know, you, um...
you actually proved me wrong.

01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:35.869
I thought
you'd lose interest.

01:19:35.869 --> 01:19:37.005
Like you did
when you were a kid
with the tree house.

01:19:38.005 --> 01:19:41.945
But...
you impressed me.

01:19:44.945 --> 01:19:46.948
Thanks, Dad.

01:19:47.948 --> 01:19:50.618
Listen, you know,
I know I haven't been
the best father lately.

01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:52.953
And you can take this
for whatever it's worth.

01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:54.288
But, um...

01:19:55.288 --> 01:19:57.261
I just don't want you
riding cross-country.

01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:04.931
Now, listen.
You're gonna be out there
all by yourself.

01:20:04.931 --> 01:20:08.502
Going across the country,
okay? It's not safe.

01:20:09.502 --> 01:20:12.212
I don't know
if I can handle losing
someone else in my family.

01:20:19.212 --> 01:20:20.997
Can you do that for me?

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.608
Hey.

01:20:47.608 --> 01:20:50.278
Wow, you look great.
Are you ready for this?

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.283
Yeah. Let's go.

01:21:00.253 --> 01:21:01.253
Hey!

01:21:00.253 --> 01:21:01.555
Hey, Pop.

01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:04.555
This is Jubilee.

01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:04.391
Hi, Mr. Bishop.

01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:07.328
Wow. You sure have grown up
since the last time
I last saw you,

01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:10.297
sitting in the bleachers,
watching your brother
play football.

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:12.297
Yeah.

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:12.600
He was a heck of a player.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.635
You guys chat.
I'm gonna check on the food.

01:21:14.635 --> 01:21:17.203
Yeah, I spent a lot of time
sitting in those bleachers.

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:18.039
Yes, you did.

01:21:19.039 --> 01:21:22.176
Jubilee. Jubilee.
You know, my father
sang gospel

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:23.176
in a jubilee quartet.

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:23.610
Really?

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:25.712
Mm-hmm. You ever heard of that?
That kind of thing?

01:21:25.712 --> 01:21:27.515
No, I don't think so.
Sorry.

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.182
Ah, no reason you would.

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:32.520
Would you get that for me?

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.520
Yeah.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.121
Thanks.

01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:35.359
Yeah.

01:21:39.359 --> 01:21:40.729
Kim?

01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:43.096
Yeah, hi.

01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:44.096
Hey.

01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:44.198
Hey.

01:21:45.198 --> 01:21:46.201
What's up, Kim?

01:21:47.201 --> 01:21:50.237
Uh, your dad said
you needed hot sauce
for your dinner.

01:21:50.237 --> 01:21:52.172
Yeah, we're out
of hot sauce.

01:21:52.172 --> 01:21:53.275
Dad, I made
chicken Alfredo.

01:21:55.275 --> 01:21:56.476
Everything goes
with hot sauce.

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.114
Mm-hmm.
You like hot sauce?

01:22:01.114 --> 01:22:02.750
-Sure.
-See? See?

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.417
How about you stay
for dinner?

01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:07.755
You know what, I only made
enough for us three, so...

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.760
Maybe next time.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.229
Thanks.

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:17.365
Nice necklace.

01:22:19.533 --> 01:22:21.034
Why don't we all sit down.

01:22:21.935 --> 01:22:23.570
And there are so many
who have so little.

01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:26.041
Thank you
for this food. Amen.

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:27.842
Amen.

01:22:28.842 --> 01:22:31.380
So, Jubilee, what do you want
to do after you graduate?

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.582
You know,
I don't really know.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.417
She's going on
a cross-country horse trip.

01:22:37.417 --> 01:22:38.685
Doesn't that take
a lot of money?

01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:40.520
Not once you have
the horse.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.256
It'd be a lot of money
for this family.

01:22:42.256 --> 01:22:44.693
Not if you do something
called saving.

01:22:45.693 --> 01:22:50.463
Must be nice being able
to take all that time
off work.

01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:51.798
Do you have something
against riding?

01:22:51.798 --> 01:22:57.506
No, no. I'm just admiring
your privileged life.

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.240
You should be grateful.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.542
Well, I'm not going
anymore.

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:04.413
What do you mean?

01:23:06.413 --> 01:23:08.518
It was too much for my dad.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:13.421
Everything I want
gets taken from me.

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.822
Mmm.

01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:18.725
Yeah. Welcome to
our reality, young lady.

01:23:18.725 --> 01:23:20.327
Well, that's what
happened to me.

01:23:20.327 --> 01:23:22.162
That's what happened
to Jordan.

01:23:22.162 --> 01:23:26.734
That's just ordinary life
outside of your ivory castle.

01:23:26.734 --> 01:23:27.770
Dad.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.305
So you think you're
the only one with problems?

01:23:31.305 --> 01:23:33.239
You think that
just because my dad
makes a decent income

01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:34.841
that my dreams aren't valid?

01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:37.811
No, you don't get it.

01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:40.448
Jordan still has hope.

01:23:41.448 --> 01:23:43.685
He's almost recovered.

01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:46.158
Not from the concussion.

01:23:51.158 --> 01:23:53.528
I thought you said
that wasn't a big deal.

01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:57.297
I didn't want you
to worry about it.
You got enough going on.

01:23:57.297 --> 01:24:01.234
Dreams can definitely die
when white boys jump you

01:24:01.234 --> 01:24:04.738
because they're jealous
of a borrowed car and...

01:24:05.738 --> 01:24:07.641
your white girlfriend.

01:24:08.641 --> 01:24:10.479
Dad, it wasn't her fault.

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:12.814
Jordan.

01:24:13.814 --> 01:24:15.884
Would you please
take me home?

01:24:16.884 --> 01:24:18.328
I don't think
I'm welcome here.

01:24:28.328 --> 01:24:29.364
Hey.

01:25:25.319 --> 01:25:26.587
Hey, Pop.

01:25:27.587 --> 01:25:28.956
Think you could get me
an introduction

01:25:28.956 --> 01:25:31.395
with the foreman
down at the factory?

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.311
I can do that.

01:25:51.311 --> 01:25:52.314
Hey.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.720
You okay?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.422
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:26:02.422 --> 01:26:04.824
You don't have to lie to me.
I know you're not fine.

01:26:04.824 --> 01:26:07.630
But you can lie to me
about your concussion?

01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:11.731
Why didn't you stand up
for me last night?

01:26:11.731 --> 01:26:15.502
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:17.537
But you snapped
at a grown man.

01:26:17.537 --> 01:26:20.240
I'm so sick of people
saying that I need
to learn this,

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.743
that I don't get it
and I don't understand.

01:26:22.743 --> 01:26:26.282
And maybe I don't,
but I'm trying.

01:26:28.282 --> 01:26:29.985
Maybe trying's
not good enough.

01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:33.654
Do you really want
to go through life

01:26:33.654 --> 01:26:35.756
having to deal with this
all the time?

01:26:36.756 --> 01:26:39.695
That's your dad talking.
Not you.

01:26:42.695 --> 01:26:45.668
I decided
to quit football.

01:26:48.668 --> 01:26:49.904
Wow.

01:26:50.904 --> 01:26:54.444
But that's okay.
We can figure that out.

01:26:57.444 --> 01:26:59.779
Broken dreams are worth
putting back together.

01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:02.550
I don't know
if I believe that anymore.

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:05.985
I think we were
just being naive.

01:27:05.985 --> 01:27:07.854
The world doesn't care
about our dreams.

01:27:07.854 --> 01:27:09.657
That's why we have
to fight for them.

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:12.693
No, I think we were both
just going through
a whole lot at the time,

01:27:12.693 --> 01:27:14.395
and we just forced it.

01:27:15.395 --> 01:27:18.802
No. No, don't do this.

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:24.706
Our worlds are just
too different.

01:27:25.706 --> 01:27:27.475
I just don't see
a good future for us.

01:27:29.475 --> 01:27:30.412
This is what's best.

01:27:32.412 --> 01:27:33.015
For you.

01:27:36.015 --> 01:27:38.326
Can't I decide
what's best for me?

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:47.435
I can't believe
you're giving up.

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:57.010
Just never forget you were
one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:04.841
I'm sorry about your ride.

01:30:41.768 --> 01:30:43.203
So, he was trained
for endurance,

01:30:43.203 --> 01:30:45.671
so he should be able to do
anything you need him to do.

01:30:45.671 --> 01:30:47.707
Okay. How old is he?

01:30:47.707 --> 01:30:49.707
Fourteen.

01:30:47.707 --> 01:30:49.510
Fourteen.

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.510
How long have you had him?

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.646
Uh, about seven,
eight years.

01:30:53.646 --> 01:30:55.983
Good. All up to date
on his shots, I assume?

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.989
Yes. Yes.

01:31:02.989 --> 01:31:04.557
There you go.

01:31:04.557 --> 01:31:07.557
Thank you.

01:31:04.557 --> 01:31:07.261
I'll come get him
in the morning.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:10.261
All right.
Sounds good. Bye.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:10.998
Thanks, Lee.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.844
I did what you said.

01:31:23.844 --> 01:31:25.720
I sold Casey's horse.

01:31:43.596 --> 01:31:47.604

good-bye, okay?

01:33:21.261 --> 01:33:23.265
I wish you could have gone
on the trip with me.

01:33:26.265 --> 01:33:29.229
I'll miss you.

01:34:20.119 --> 01:34:21.761
Shh, shh.

01:34:27.761 --> 01:34:29.104
I miss him, Dad.

01:34:38.104 --> 01:34:40.306
I just, uh,
hope he has a good home.

01:34:40.306 --> 01:34:42.475
Yeah. My kids
are gonna love him.

01:34:42.475 --> 01:34:44.475
Thank you very much.

01:34:42.475 --> 01:34:44.176
Bye. Thank you.

01:34:44.176 --> 01:34:45.878
Be safe.

01:34:45.878 --> 01:34:47.878
Hey.

01:34:45.878 --> 01:34:47.251
Hey.

01:34:51.251 --> 01:34:53.087
Let me know if you need me
to tuck you in tonight.

01:34:55.087 --> 01:34:57.859
Think I will.

01:35:33.859 --> 01:35:34.862
Mr. Bishop.

01:35:35.862 --> 01:35:38.268
Could you
please make sure
Jordan gets this?

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.078
Thank you.

01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:28.617
Hey. How about giving
your old man a shot, huh?

01:36:30.617 --> 01:36:31.018
No way.

01:36:32.018 --> 01:36:34.018
Yes way. Your ball.

01:36:32.018 --> 01:36:34.221
Where'd you get that?

01:36:35.221 --> 01:36:38.490
I dug it out of the drawer.
This is my old one from 1990.

01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:40.327
Let's go. Come on.

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:42.327
You ready for this?

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:42.229
I'm ready for this.

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:43.332
Let's go, old man.

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:47.043
Ah! Dude, you pushed off!

01:36:58.043 --> 01:37:01.118
Ooh. You like that.
Yeah, that's a good one.

01:37:06.118 --> 01:37:07.021
Why are you always
spoiling them?

01:37:09.021 --> 01:37:11.490
Don't tell anybody,

01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:14.996
but I'm gonna miss a few
of these stinky things.

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.636
I don't think
I'm a horse-ist anymore.

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:25.238
I, uh...
I got your letter.

01:37:26.238 --> 01:37:27.408
Good.

01:37:29.408 --> 01:37:30.279
You sold Chief?

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:34.050
Yeah. I did.

01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:38.288
But it was good for me.

01:37:42.288 --> 01:37:43.292
I finally did it, you know?

01:37:46.292 --> 01:37:48.564
Let myself be sad
about Casey.

01:37:51.564 --> 01:37:53.002
That's good.
I'm proud of you.

01:37:57.002 --> 01:38:00.573
Lee, that's a lot of money.
I can't accept it.

01:38:00.573 --> 01:38:02.443
No, it was Casey's.

01:38:03.443 --> 01:38:07.215
He would've wanted you to be
the first in your family
to graduate college.

01:38:09.215 --> 01:38:14.322
And you did that even...
even after I ended things.

01:38:15.322 --> 01:38:19.059
Yeah, well,
just because you don't want
to fight for us

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:21.463
doesn't mean that I can't
still love your dreams.

01:38:24.463 --> 01:38:25.666
Well...

01:38:26.666 --> 01:38:28.436
it's enough for one year
at a state school.

01:38:30.436 --> 01:38:32.204
If I work hard enough,
I can afford the next.

01:38:32.204 --> 01:38:35.042
And if I get
good enough grades,
which I plan to...

01:38:36.042 --> 01:38:37.378
I could earn a scholarship
for my master's.

01:38:39.378 --> 01:38:41.413
You know,
statistically speaking,

01:38:41.413 --> 01:38:46.086
78% of minorities
with a GPA of 3.8 or higher
earn full scholarships.

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:50.324
Wow. Sounds like
the math wiz has a plan.

01:38:52.324 --> 01:38:55.096
What about you?
What do you want to do
after you graduate?

01:38:57.096 --> 01:39:02.036
Guess I'll just stay here.
Give lessons, board horses.

01:39:03.036 --> 01:39:07.609
Hang with Ghost and Cody
until I finally figure out
what I want to do.

01:39:09.609 --> 01:39:13.145
Well, I missed enrollment
for fall semester.

01:39:13.145 --> 01:39:17.284
So I have to wait until
the spring rolls around.

01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:21.256
I have some downtime.

01:39:23.256 --> 01:39:28.060
And I figure there's
nothing else I'd rather do

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.231
than get on a horse
for three months and...

01:39:32.231 --> 01:39:34.036
head towards
the Pacific Ocean with you.

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:46.515
I missed you.

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.418
I want to fight for this.

01:39:52.418 --> 01:39:55.122
Your broken dreams
are worth putting
back together too.

01:39:56.122 --> 01:39:57.231
Yes, they are.

01:40:06.231 --> 01:40:08.768
So, about those
toothless mountain men.

01:40:08.768 --> 01:40:10.837
Oh, my God!
You are still scared.

01:40:10.837 --> 01:40:13.773
I'm just worried.
I just think there's
power in numbers.

01:40:13.773 --> 01:40:17.773
That's all I'm saying.
Is that too much to ask?

01:40:13.773 --> 01:40:17.118
Yes.

Dad, you sure
you're okay with this?

01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:27.913
Yeah. I couldn't be
more proud.

01:41:27.913 --> 01:41:29.748
But we haven't
even started yet.

01:41:29.748 --> 01:41:32.286
Ah, sweetheart,
I'm not talking
about the ride.

01:41:33.286 --> 01:41:35.390
I'm talking about
everything you've done
for this family.

01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:38.757
Stop. Stop.

01:41:38.757 --> 01:41:41.757
Don't get mushy
on me, all right?

01:41:38.757 --> 01:41:41.161
Okay.

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:42.628
You two need
to get on out of here.

01:41:42.628 --> 01:41:44.796
The trailer's already
packed, and I'll...

01:41:44.796 --> 01:41:47.699
catch up with you at your
first checkpoint tonight.

01:41:47.699 --> 01:41:50.336
Okay. Thanks for
running support, Dad.

01:41:50.336 --> 01:41:53.506
Yeah, I think
it was time for me
to take a vacation.

01:41:53.506 --> 01:41:56.876
This way, Logan and I,
we can have a little
road trip, right, son?

01:41:56.876 --> 01:41:58.279
Yeah.

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:00.813
Seriously, guys.

01:42:00.813 --> 01:42:02.748
It means the world to me.

01:42:02.748 --> 01:42:05.220
Well, we want to be part
of your dream.

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.457
-Take care of my girl.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Grove.

01:42:12.457 --> 01:42:14.493
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.

01:42:14.493 --> 01:42:15.895
Have a blast!

01:42:15.895 --> 01:42:19.666

And I'll see you tonight, man.

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:21.666

01:42:26.939 --> 01:42:29.358
