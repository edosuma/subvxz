01:38.973 --> 01:41.893
HAN JEONG-HUN

01:48.233 --> 01:50.360
"Let's meet later."

01:50.944 --> 01:53.488
I see he's getting anxious now.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.032
Who's getting anxious?

01:56.157 --> 01:58.284
Mom, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.

01:58.576 --> 02:02.413
What have you been up to lately?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.707
What do you mean?

02:05.166 --> 02:08.002
Justice will prevail in the end.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.172
If people commit a crime,
they will be punished for it.

03:05.643 --> 03:06.728
Good morning.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.854
Come have some breakfast.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.621
When did you prepare all this?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.626
Here.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.836
Have some juice.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.428
Thank you.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.431
If you're grateful,

03:44.682 --> 03:45.934
give me a kiss.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.020
Gosh.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.774
I made breakfast for you,
and you can't even do that for me?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.446
I need to eat quickly and get going soon.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.198
Eun-seong is waiting for me.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.201
You're the one who called me here.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.912
I'm busy too. I have to get to work.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.874
You're right.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.129
Call me if that jerk comes back.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.589
Sorry?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.091
The jerk that's threatening you.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.551
Don't listen to anything he says.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.137
I'll take care of it.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.306
But...

04:26.349 --> 04:28.226
who hired him?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.187
Don't worry yourself over it.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.022
We didn't get the surgery anyway.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.774
We have nothing to fear.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.780
I'll get that jerk,

04:42.365 --> 04:43.533
so forget about him.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.375
And about your illness.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.545
Leave that to me too.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.964
I'll have good news for you soon.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.466
Good news?

05:01.551 --> 05:05.138
I sent your MRI to the top expert
in that field.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.933
You can get surgery.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.810
There's nothing that can't be fixed.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.688
You can ignore what they say about
your "likelihood of survival."

05:20.486 --> 05:21.446
In return,

05:22.822 --> 05:24.407
promise me something.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.453
Don't ever run away again.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.999
Promise me that you will never

05:34.042 --> 05:35.126
run away.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.353
Now.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.314
Pinky promise.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.779
Seal.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.202
Kiss.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.212
Don't you dare run away again.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.297
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth

06:22.340 --> 06:23.466
and kiss you.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.306
Okay, let's eat.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.895
Here.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.232
All right.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.195
Here.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.582
What?

06:57.834 --> 06:58.918
What are you doing?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.924
You're getting sauce all over you.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.998
Thank you.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.541
You should hurry and go to work.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.418
I want to see Eun-seong before I go.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.086
Later.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.255
It'll be awkward if Mother sees you.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.757
Why would it be awkward?
I'll just greet her.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.092
What do you mean, "just greet her"?

07:48.843 --> 07:49.927
Next time.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.804
Next time.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.640
Hold on.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.336
That was such a short trip.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.087
I know.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.255
-Mom.
-Yes?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.423
Where's Mister?

08:28.508 --> 08:32.428
-What?
-He came last night looking for you.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.138
Didn't he call you?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.184
Oh, he did.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.687
I guess you didn't break up.
You just fought.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.107
-The thing is--
-Never mind.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.944
Don't feel uncomfortable because of me.
It's fine.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.278
It's natural.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.074
Couples fight. That's how it is.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.078
Eun-seong likes him a lot.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.082
She was talking about him
all day long yesterday.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.377
He must be a pretty decent guy.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.256
Just take him back.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.966
Try to get along.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.969
He was looking for you everywhere.
He looked so worried.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.014
He must like you a great deal.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.811
Don't worry about me.

09:21.894 --> 09:22.979
It's okay.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.565
That's right.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.899
Get along with him.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.193
Come on, Mom.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.196
-Okay.
-Good morning, Eun-seong.

09:32.488 --> 09:33.573
Good morning.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.533
Did you have a good trip?

09:36.659 --> 09:37.743
Yes.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.830
Seung-ju,
thanks for taking good care of her.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.998
It was nothing.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.085
HANNAM FOOD

09:46.460 --> 09:47.545
Director Choi,

09:47.962 --> 09:49.797
everyone was
against the restaurant business,

09:50.047 --> 09:51.507
but we were wise to push forward with it.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.426
You're right.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.344
You had good foresight.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.721
Thanks.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.390
Ji-hun is a good businessman.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.142
He's just like me.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.770
-But...
-What?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.523
There's a strange rumor

10:08.399 --> 10:10.526
going around about Mr. Han.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.278
What do you mean?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.489
I'll just tell you what I've heard.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.743
There are rumors that he was
involved in organ trafficking.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.786
Who said that?

10:20.911 --> 10:23.956
I have no idea
where the rumors originated.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.793
I only heard what the employees were
saying among themselves.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.420
Organ trafficking?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.839
How absurd is that?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.383
Who started such an outrageous rumor?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.344
Please calm down.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.929
That brat...

10:39.597 --> 10:40.681
Pardon?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.393
Gosh.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.479
You rat.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.981
You swore you'd have it by today.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.608
You'd better get it today.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.817
Got it?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.778
I said I will.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.404
Why don't you trust me?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.031
Come on, now.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.074
What?

10:58.282 --> 11:01.535
Who do you think I am?
How dare you talk to me like that?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.708
Why that punk...

11:09.001 --> 11:10.294
Please leave.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.172
Hello, my dear A-ra.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.966
Get lost, will you?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.052
Hi, Baldy.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.345
Why you...

11:19.428 --> 11:20.513
Hey!

11:29.271 --> 11:30.356
Go.

11:46.705 --> 11:47.665
Dad.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.125
You fool.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.086
Were you that jealous
of your brother's success?

11:53.421 --> 11:55.339
What are you talking about?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.507
Ji-hun's rumor.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.676
I know you started it.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.970
What rumor?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.347
I have no idea what you're talking about.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.643
They say Ji-hun was involved
in organ trafficking.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.020
What?

12:10.187 --> 12:11.647
What do you mean?

12:12.022 --> 12:14.108
I have no idea...

12:17.361 --> 12:18.821
Do you know what this is?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.701
This is a petition filed
by the secretaries that you fired.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.537
It details every little thing

12:26.745 --> 12:28.289
that you did to them.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.624
I stopped it

12:31.083 --> 12:32.501
before it reached the media.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.296
What?

12:35.754 --> 12:38.048
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.300
Go ahead and read it.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.968
You'll shake in your boots.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.262
That's not all.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.723
There's another document inside.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.684
It looks like you took

12:48.934 --> 12:50.936
the company's funds
and used them here and there.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.150
Why did you take my medical records?

12:56.984 --> 13:00.029
Were you going to make it look like
I have dementia and make me step down?

13:05.868 --> 13:06.952
Dad.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.121
If you're going to cause trouble,
do it well.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.415
Then I'll acknowledge you.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.502
Clean up after Ji-hun's rumor.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.379
If it gets leaked to the media,

13:17.838 --> 13:19.340
I'll destroy you and me both.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.884
I'll tell them everything that you did.

13:23.677 --> 13:27.014
You and I can destroy this company

13:27.681 --> 13:29.225
and self-destruct together.

13:30.851 --> 13:31.977
Got it?

13:32.686 --> 13:34.647
Dad.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.751
What is it?

13:57.378 --> 14:01.173
This is Kang Hye-su's diagnosis
from the States.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.467
It's the analysis of the MRI
that Mr. Han sent

14:03.551 --> 14:05.386
and Dr. Parsons' diagnosis.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.557
-Ji-hun doesn't know about this, right?
-That's correct.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.728
How would I...

14:15.271 --> 14:16.355
Get it translated.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.815
Yes, sir.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.073
Be careful.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.950
Where did you hear that?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.744
I went to the head office
for some training,

14:31.495 --> 14:32.997
and someone there told me.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.499
Mr. Han bought an organ?

14:35.749 --> 14:36.834
It must be false, right?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.252
What?

14:38.752 --> 14:39.795
What is it?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.380
Organ trafficking, this time?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.299
First, sexual harassment,
and now organ trafficking?

14:43.382 --> 14:44.842
He has no boundaries.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.302
What?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.178
What did you just say?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.348
Mr. Han must be committing
all sorts of crimes.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.766
It's organ trafficking this time.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.268
Who said that?

14:54.351 --> 14:57.229
Where did you hear
something so ridiculous?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.857
Gosh, I'm going crazy!

14:59.940 --> 15:01.650
Tell him to get his act together.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.944
How else would such a rumor even start?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.530
-Soon, he'll even murder someone.
-What? Murder?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.658
Chef!

15:10.075 --> 15:11.035
Please.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.663
How could you talk about murder
under these cherry blossoms?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.874
My goodness.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.600
Hye-su, are you okay?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.312
Hye-su?

15:39.146 --> 15:40.773
Yes, I'm fine.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.192
Don't worry.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.334
Are you sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

16:01.543 --> 16:03.379
It's fine,
I'll just take my medication and sleep.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.506
I was a little nauseous, but I'm okay now.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.681
Ju-yeon.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.265
Yes?

16:16.392 --> 16:17.476
Thanks.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.562
-For what?
-Thanks.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.148
Thanks for everything.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.528
I'll get better and repay you.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.614
Okay?

16:33.367 --> 16:34.535
Stop talking nonsense.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.370
Lie down.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.110
What are you doing
with your door wide open?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.362
What is that?

17:10.571 --> 17:11.989
What are you reading?

17:22.207 --> 17:23.292
Ji-hun.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.878
The thing is,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.172
it's hard for me to say this to you,

17:28.589 --> 17:30.299
but rumors are going around
in the head office.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.469
The surgery didn't even happen.
They're so cruel.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.012
Who leaked the information?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.847
Who started the rumor?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.521
I need to get to work.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.693
Ji-hun, what's wrong?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.781
DOCTOR'S MEDICAL OPINION

17:53.864 --> 17:55.282
That moron.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.166
What is it?

18:09.713 --> 18:10.923
It's my resignation letter.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.176
I'm sorry for causing damage
to the company.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.762
I'll quit

18:17.179 --> 18:18.388
before things get worse.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.641
How dare you take something like this
so lightly?

18:21.683 --> 18:22.976
It's my fault,

18:23.268 --> 18:24.978
so I should take responsibility.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.649
Put that away.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.735
Nothing has happened yet,
and I'm trying to fix things.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.779
It's easy to fix.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.281
I have enough power to do that.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.285
No,

18:41.245 --> 18:42.996
it's not something to fix, Dad.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.083
Please accept my resignation.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.922
Thank you for everything.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.022
That punk.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.332
Why weren't you picking up?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.877
Well, I was busy.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.631
You want me

19:35.132 --> 19:36.383
to step down, right?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.013
Fine.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.931
I'll step down.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.351
In return,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.188
-leave her alone.
-"Her"?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.023
Leave her alone.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.066
Forget it.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.985
Step down from what?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.989
I was merely worried about the company.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.324
I have no grudge against you.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.411
I was genuinely worried that
people would find out about what you did

20:04.494 --> 20:06.371
and that it would hurt the company.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.041
But I thought it over,

20:09.625 --> 20:12.419
and everyone makes mistakes.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.464
As your big brother,

20:15.797 --> 20:17.007
I decided to be understanding.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.263
Bye.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.973
Please remember my request.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.945
-We're here.
-They're here.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.046
I heard you're very sick.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.134
Yet you agreed to get surgery
in your condition.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.720
You've got a lot of nerve.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.014
How desperate were you

21:06.682 --> 21:07.975
to go that far?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.895
How much did you bug Ji-hun

21:12.396 --> 21:13.939
that he contacted someone in the States

21:14.439 --> 21:15.816
about your illness?

21:18.026 --> 21:19.111
Here.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.072
This is the response from that hospital.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.991
Go and read it.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.702
It isn't good news,

21:27.244 --> 21:28.453
so don't get your hopes up.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.665
Take it.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.425
Did you know that

21:41.758 --> 21:43.885
Ji-hun has been under fire these days?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.013
Rumors have spread,

21:46.305 --> 21:49.016
so his life is basically over.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.393
Sorry?

21:51.685 --> 21:52.978
There's no other way.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.897
I need you to step up.

21:57.774 --> 22:01.111
I want you to say that you were the one

22:02.404 --> 22:05.365
behind the fake marriage
and the illegal surgery.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.827
Say that you approached Ji-hun
to get money out of him,

22:09.119 --> 22:10.912
but that everything fell through.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.915
You didn't get the surgery anyway.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.378
I'll compensate you

22:18.837 --> 22:20.213
generously.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.966
Your child is still very young.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.302
Once you're gone,

22:25.510 --> 22:27.054
she'll need money

22:27.387 --> 22:28.722
until she's grown up.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.105
I'll draft up an affidavit.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.733
You just need to sign it.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.819
I'll make sure that
you don't come to any harm.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.946
The police won't investigate you.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.449
I took care of that already,

22:48.575 --> 22:51.244
so don't worry about that.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.662
Sir.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.624
Think about it until tomorrow.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.126
You're leaving anyway.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.171
You should stock up on good deeds
before you go.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.698
Set my interview schedule

23:29.783 --> 23:30.992
as soon as possible.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.745
A foreign company would be nice.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.832
Okay. I'll wait for your call.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.585
Are you getting a new job?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.130
Gosh.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.551
Thanks for putting up with me
all this time.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.011
Take good care of The Promise.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.725
Am I getting a promotion then?
Will I take your position?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.435
Hey.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.980
What is it? What's going on?

24:00.397 --> 24:02.274
I'm going to have a farewell party
with Hye-su later.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.237
What? Then did it really get out?

24:07.654 --> 24:08.780
Did it?

24:15.036 --> 24:16.913
DAON HOSPITAL

24:17.956 --> 24:20.125
Are the results very bad?

24:25.172 --> 24:26.965
Please tell me.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.762
It won't be that different
just because the hospital is famous.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.764
Unfortunately,

24:35.223 --> 24:37.851
it isn't different from what we said.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.690
Don't be too discouraged.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.108
Let's try our best.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.777
Doctor.

24:51.406 --> 24:53.158
Am I even getting better?

24:53.575 --> 24:56.578
We've only just begun.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.663
It's too soon to be disappointed.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.335
Can't you tell me that I'm getting better?

25:06.004 --> 25:07.088
Let's be strong.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.340
You'll get better.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.554
Please tell me I'm getting better.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.974
Even if it's a lie.

25:19.893 --> 25:20.977
Please?

25:30.237 --> 25:31.529
Hey!

25:32.530 --> 25:34.241
Why are you so hard to find?

25:34.532 --> 25:35.617
You're like a celebrity.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.244
What is it now?

25:37.535 --> 25:38.745
What else?

25:39.329 --> 25:40.413
I need your signature.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.374
For 500 million won.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.880
Why are you smiling? You'll grow on me.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.675
I just can't help but smile.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.344
So many people are offering me money.

25:54.803 --> 25:55.887
What do you mean?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.223
I'm leaving.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.350
I'm exhausted.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.352
Are you sick?

26:02.894 --> 26:03.979
Did you catch the flu?

26:04.854 --> 26:06.690
You got me sick.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.026
So why are you being so difficult?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.028
Look.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.572
Do you know what this is?

26:15.699 --> 26:17.117
How would I know?

26:18.076 --> 26:19.452
I'm dying.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.039
It says right here that I'm dying.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.294
What do you mean?

26:30.297 --> 26:31.798
Don't you know what "dying" means?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.175
I do, but...

26:35.343 --> 26:36.720
What is it? You're scaring me.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.056
If you're scared, then leave.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.726
Get lost while I'm being nice.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.687
Wait a second.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.897
Gosh. Hold on.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.359
Hello?

26:52.068 --> 26:53.528
I came to see her now.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.155
I told you to stop rushing me.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.407
Forget it. It's over.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.367
What?

26:59.909 --> 27:02.412
Forget it. Don't bother.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.080
I don't need her signature anymore.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.373
What do you mean?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.834
Why is it suddenly over?

27:09.127 --> 27:10.211
Hello?

27:10.754 --> 27:11.838
Hello?

27:12.339 --> 27:13.423
What the...

27:14.299 --> 27:16.760
Make sure no tabloid or anything

27:17.010 --> 27:19.888
publishes a single word.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.223
Control the media.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.102
Call a board meeting tomorrow too.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.398
I'll explain it myself
before the rumor spreads any further.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.650
Also,

27:32.734 --> 27:35.445
tell Attorney Oh to come
to the office early in the morning.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.281
Gosh.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.533
Why are you so stressed?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.535
You told Jeong-hun, didn't you?

27:43.661 --> 27:44.662
About what?

27:44.746 --> 27:48.083
Ji-hun is about to get arrested
for organ trafficking.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.752
What do you mean?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.295
Don't play dumb.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.547
Where did you hear about that?

27:54.714 --> 27:56.216
No one knew about it.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.804
Did you make Na-yoon give you the details?

28:03.681 --> 28:05.350
If anything happens,

28:06.351 --> 28:08.395
I'm going to get rid of Jeong-hun first.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.022
Tell him that.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.565
My goodness.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.110
How could you say that?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.320
What has Jeong-hun done wrong?

28:18.279 --> 28:20.073
It's not like he made it up.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.159
A sin is a sin.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.536
A sin?

28:24.744 --> 28:26.621
He did it to save his mom.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.667
Jeong-hun would never have
done that for you.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.690
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:53.773 --> 28:54.858
Thank you.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.736
You must be tired from waiting.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.446
The surgery went very well.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.905
They are both fine.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.324
Thank you.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.577
Your mom should be awake by now.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.078
You should go and see her.

29:07.537 --> 29:08.621
Okay.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.197
Mom.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.824
Congratulations.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.915
Uncle is doing well too.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.463
I'll thank him for you.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.188
JI-HUN

31:39.397 --> 31:41.816
Come outside so I can see you.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.333
Ms. Cha Eun-seong.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.209
-What is it?
-"What is it?"

32:00.460 --> 32:02.754
What are you going to do about this?

32:03.963 --> 32:07.508
Please fix it. I want this color.
This one.

32:08.051 --> 32:08.968
Okay.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.012
-I trust you.
-Okay.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.973
I can't pay you if you do it like this.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.975
Make it pretty.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.313
Mister.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.566
Eun-seong.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.734
Hello.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.653
-Hello.
-Eun-seong.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.740
Where's Hye-su?

32:31.074 --> 32:32.158
Well,

32:32.367 --> 32:35.453
she's a bit tired, so she's lying down.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.163
Did she go to the hospital?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.041
Do you

32:40.875 --> 32:41.960
know everything?

32:43.544 --> 32:44.629
Eun-seong,

32:44.921 --> 32:47.882
do you want to go look at cherry blossoms
with me and get ice cream?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.175
Yes.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.053
Eun-seong, it's late.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.305
It's almost your bedtime.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.515
We'll be quick.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.558
Let's go.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.852
I'll be back.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.605
I'll do your nails later.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.648
Okay.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.609
Are you asleep?

33:08.778 --> 33:10.071
No, I'm not.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.533
He came by.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.370
He took Eun-seong out.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.594
Hey.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.473
Tell me the truth.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.018
Are you two dating?

33:41.477 --> 33:42.562
What?

33:44.063 --> 33:45.189
You are.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.113
Did he go with you on your trip?

33:53.614 --> 33:54.699
No.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.493
Not from the start.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.079
So he did. I see.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.706
That's not it, Ju-yeon.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.333
Gosh, you brat.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.544
I'll let it slide, since you're sick.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.755
I didn't think that you,

34:09.630 --> 34:11.215
of all people, would play coy.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.718
Hold on. In that case,

34:14.552 --> 34:17.930
was your love rekindled after the divorce?

34:18.222 --> 34:19.307
No?

34:20.475 --> 34:21.684
What happened?

34:26.856 --> 34:27.940
Never mind.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.153
Tell me later when you feel like it.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.493
By the way,
Eun-seong seems to like him a lot.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.120
Since when did they get along so well?

34:41.204 --> 34:43.539
I was super jealous.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.292
I'll win her back, just you wait.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.594
Mister.

34:57.053 --> 34:57.970
Yes?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.847
Did you make up with Mom?

35:01.182 --> 35:02.266
Of course.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.935
Good job.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.895
You think so?

35:06.229 --> 35:07.313
Thank you.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.316
Mister,

35:10.817 --> 35:12.193
Mom said

35:12.735 --> 35:14.612
her head hurts a lot.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.077
Did she?

35:23.412 --> 35:24.789
She'll be well soon.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.415
Don't worry.

35:26.499 --> 35:30.461
You're right. My mom is super strong.

35:31.879 --> 35:34.382
She also said she'll be well soon.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.468
Eun-seong,

35:38.177 --> 35:41.013
Mom is strong, healthy,

35:41.514 --> 35:43.558
and pretty, isn't she?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.601
You're right.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.312
Your mom

35:48.896 --> 35:50.982
is the strongest and coolest person

35:51.566 --> 35:52.733
I've ever met.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.945
After meeting her,

35:56.612 --> 35:58.239
I became very brave.

35:59.323 --> 36:02.368
I used to be a coward and a crybaby,

36:03.411 --> 36:04.912
but ever since I met her,

36:05.705 --> 36:07.373
I suddenly became strong.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.000
Why?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.669
Your mom told me

36:12.545 --> 36:14.463
that I was a good person.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.425
I didn't know

36:18.259 --> 36:19.844
that I was

36:20.469 --> 36:21.679
a good person.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.265
You are a good person.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.646
Really?

36:31.856 --> 36:32.940
Thank you.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.400
Your welcome.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.235
Eun-seong.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.571
Why don't you,

36:38.696 --> 36:41.032
your mom, and I

36:42.700 --> 36:46.579
live a long, happy life together?

36:46.787 --> 36:47.872
Okay.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.169
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

36:53.252 --> 36:54.587
Yes, I do.

36:54.837 --> 36:57.215
-Okay. Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.342
I'll hide first.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.676
Okay.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.553
Here I go.

37:03.512 --> 37:07.308
Hurry up and hide. Ready or not,

37:07.391 --> 37:08.768
here I come.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.979
Eun-seong?

37:15.858 --> 37:16.943
Eun-seong?

37:20.404 --> 37:21.489
Eun-seong.

37:24.617 --> 37:25.910
Eun-seong.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.871
You scared me, Eun-seong.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.583
You scared me.

37:38.798 --> 37:39.882
Am I pretty?

37:40.341 --> 37:42.134
Okay. Rock, paper, scissors.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.220
Me too. Rock, paper, scissors.

37:44.887 --> 37:45.972
Mom.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.766
There you are. Did you have fun?

37:49.392 --> 37:52.103
-It's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

37:59.652 --> 38:00.736
What's going on?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.364
You look well.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.658
You faked being sick, didn't you?

38:14.292 --> 38:15.835
Why did you go
to the hospital alone again?

38:15.918 --> 38:17.295
I told you to let me know when you go.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.422
Okay, I will.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.590
Eun-seong!

38:37.064 --> 38:38.149
About that jerk.

38:38.941 --> 38:40.151
The one threatening you.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.819
What?

38:41.902 --> 38:43.612
He won't bother you again.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.323
It's been taken care of.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.701
Well, that's a relief.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.496
If he comes again, call me right away.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.584
Okay, I will.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.297
I'm sorry for making you worry.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.470
Wait.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.850
Did you hear

39:13.476 --> 39:14.852
about my results?

39:16.270 --> 39:17.355
What?

39:17.646 --> 39:19.607
My MRI that you sent to the States.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.695
Oh, those results.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.907
Yes.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.492
I got it.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.162
Even if the results are bad,

39:34.413 --> 39:35.956
don't be too heartbroken, okay?

39:36.749 --> 39:38.042
Who says they're bad?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.543
They said it's good. Very good.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.711
It isn't bad at all.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.632
As long as you stick to the treatment,
you can be fully cured.

39:45.591 --> 39:46.675
What did I say?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.762
With all the advancements in medicine
these days, they can fix anything.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.641
That's great.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.476
Of course, it is.

39:55.893 --> 39:56.977
That's right.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.562
It's super great.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.023
Gosh. Of course, it is.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.402
Promise you'll beat it no matter what.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.615
Promise.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.743
Seal.

40:13.786 --> 40:14.870
Kiss?

40:17.373 --> 40:18.457
Kiss!

40:19.792 --> 40:20.876
Kiss.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.044
Kiss!

40:22.378 --> 40:23.462
Kiss?

40:24.463 --> 40:25.589
Kiss.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.635
Let's go, Eun-seong.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.472
Let's go.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.308
Kiss?

40:38.561 --> 40:39.937
-Hye-su.
-Yes?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.273
I have a question.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.774
What is it?

40:44.483 --> 40:47.278
Was there anything you wanted to do
if you got a boyfriend?

40:50.239 --> 40:52.032
There must have been something.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.826
Why? Will you do them all for me?

40:54.368 --> 40:55.453
It depends on what they are.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.458
Walking with our arms linked together.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.254
I wanted to go and see
the cherry blossoms together.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.340
I wanted to go biking together.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.718
I wanted to

41:11.218 --> 41:12.553
go biking together,

41:12.636 --> 41:14.054
sing together,

41:14.138 --> 41:16.765
dance together, and...

41:16.849 --> 41:18.601
How did you keep it all in?

41:20.561 --> 41:21.645
I know, right?

41:22.271 --> 41:23.814
It was torture.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.691
Fine.

41:26.692 --> 41:27.902
If you're good to me,

41:28.819 --> 41:29.904
I'll do them one by one.

41:31.864 --> 41:32.948
Mr. Han...

41:34.408 --> 41:36.535
-Ji-hun...
-Honey.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.582
Can't I just go with "Ji-hun"?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.668
Just say, "Hey, Ji-hun," why don't you?

41:45.085 --> 41:46.170
Hey, Ji-hun.

41:46.378 --> 41:47.463
Oh, my.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.799
I have a question.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.260
What is it?

41:55.387 --> 41:56.680
Do you really like me?

41:59.600 --> 42:01.852
You're making me cringe.
Why are you asking that?

42:03.312 --> 42:04.647
What do you like about me?

42:05.272 --> 42:06.607
How much do you like me?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.568
I want to hear.

42:10.277 --> 42:11.403
You want to hear it that much?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.365
Tell me.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.117
I won't say.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.245
Don't fool around.

42:19.328 --> 42:20.412
Tell me.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.668
If you keep talking,
I'll keep kissing you.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.878
Stop that.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.839
Mister, I don't like kisses.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.299
Okay, Eun-seong.

42:32.675 --> 42:33.676
Sorry.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.679
She doesn't like kisses. Stop kissing me.

42:36.762 --> 42:37.888
It wasn't me.

42:38.138 --> 42:40.140
You're so naughty.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.187
RION ART HALL

42:54.196 --> 42:55.447
Na-yoon!

43:06.834 --> 43:08.043
Na-yoon!

43:13.340 --> 43:15.426
You wicked witch.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.888
Do you hate me that much?

43:20.514 --> 43:21.599
Do you?

43:22.099 --> 43:23.058
Why?

43:24.059 --> 43:25.144
Why?

43:28.063 --> 43:29.148
Why?

43:31.358 --> 43:32.443
Please leave.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.904
Did you know that he likes her?

43:36.989 --> 43:39.116
Gosh, you were totally

43:39.658 --> 43:42.286
dumped big time.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.500
Na-yoon, answer me.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.127
Do you still like him?

43:50.210 --> 43:51.712
Why?

43:53.881 --> 43:55.132
Did you just push me?

44:07.770 --> 44:08.854
Jeong-hun.

44:08.979 --> 44:09.938
What?

44:12.358 --> 44:14.068
Have you ever

44:15.361 --> 44:17.946
loved someone with a sincere heart?

44:19.990 --> 44:21.492
With a sincere heart?

44:22.076 --> 44:23.160
Yes.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.330
Genuinely and completely.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.584
Have you ever loved someone
with all your heart?

44:33.629 --> 44:35.798
Who hasn't done that?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.050
You.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.136
You see,

44:44.264 --> 44:46.558
he can love someone like that.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.436
That's why I like him.

44:51.730 --> 44:52.940
I still like him,

44:56.819 --> 44:58.362
and I probably always will.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.495
You don't understand, do you?

45:08.831 --> 45:10.290
Please leave before I call the police.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.880
Stop being arrogant, you brat!

45:22.886 --> 45:23.887
Come here.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.139
You're so drunk.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.057
-Come here.
-Hello!

45:27.141 --> 45:28.225
Hello, sir.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.602
Did you think I was gone?

45:31.228 --> 45:32.729
I looked all over for you.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.022
What do you want, you punk?

45:34.231 --> 45:36.859
You should pay me for my work.

45:38.444 --> 45:40.571
You didn't do anything.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.156
You didn't even get her signature.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.824
You told me not to.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.701
So we're back to square one.

45:45.784 --> 45:48.454
Why should I pay you, punk?

45:48.871 --> 45:52.040
What nonsense is this?

45:52.499 --> 45:55.669
I dropped everything and went through
so much to work for you.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.379
This isn't right.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.799
Get out of my face, you punk.

46:01.175 --> 46:05.053
I don't know what your deal is,
you piece of trash,

46:05.512 --> 46:07.931
but I'm in a bad mood,
so don't mess with me.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.433
Come on, let's go inside.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.436
"Piece of trash"?

46:12.519 --> 46:14.688
Move, you piece of trash!

46:14.771 --> 46:17.441
Trying to scam people when
you don't even do the work!

46:17.733 --> 46:20.360
Hey! I don't have any money for you!

46:20.527 --> 46:21.487
Get lost!

46:21.945 --> 46:23.322
-Let's go.
-Okay.

46:26.241 --> 46:27.367
Let's go.

46:29.536 --> 46:30.913
-That psycho.
-You rat.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.208
What did he say?

46:34.750 --> 46:35.834
Let's go.

46:35.918 --> 46:37.002
You punk!

46:37.711 --> 46:39.630
Did you just call me a punk?

46:39.922 --> 46:42.216
-Get over here.
-How dare you call me that?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.428
You punk!

46:50.974 --> 46:52.059
You...

46:52.893 --> 46:54.937
-Are you okay?
-That hurts!

46:56.605 --> 46:58.398
Look at you, you weasel.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.150
Why you...

47:00.442 --> 47:02.402
All you do is rip people off.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.323
Hey, you're no different from me.
Don't be so full of yourself.

47:06.406 --> 47:08.283
I ought to step on you.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.202
Transfer the money by tomorrow.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.370
Nice and thoughtfully.

47:13.205 --> 47:15.040
I didn't push you. You fell.

47:16.583 --> 47:17.668
That punk.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.004
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

47:29.221 --> 47:30.889
Hello, sir.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.100
Who are you?

47:33.183 --> 47:35.227
This is from the Chairman.

47:35.852 --> 47:36.895
What?

47:36.979 --> 47:40.732
He also asked me to congratulate you
on a successful surgery.

47:40.857 --> 47:41.900
Gosh.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.445
May I come in?

47:45.529 --> 47:46.613
Leave.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.574
Leave while I'm being nice.

47:50.450 --> 47:54.246
Then could you please give me a call
when you feel up to it?

47:54.413 --> 47:57.541
The Chairman needs to talk to you
about his son.

47:57.708 --> 47:58.542
Gosh.

47:58.667 --> 47:59.751
Here.

48:00.335 --> 48:01.420
Hey.

48:03.046 --> 48:04.256
That punk.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.008
Goodness.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.676
Tell me if your arm feels numb.

48:16.852 --> 48:18.562
It's from your husband.

48:21.064 --> 48:22.274
How do you feel?

48:22.816 --> 48:24.151
Do you feel okay?

48:32.951 --> 48:34.244
CHAIRMAN HAN SEONG-GUK

48:34.369 --> 48:35.871
Have you thought about it?

48:37.664 --> 48:38.665
Yes.

48:38.874 --> 48:39.958
Good.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.501
I'm glad you decided to do it.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.086
Thank you.

48:47.424 --> 48:50.344
Read over what it says.

48:52.304 --> 48:53.722
As I told you before,

48:53.847 --> 48:56.016
you won't come to any harm.

48:57.309 --> 48:59.269
I'll only use it to quiet down

48:59.728 --> 49:01.688
the rumors that are spreading
inside the company.

49:01.897 --> 49:03.190
So don't worry.

49:05.651 --> 49:08.070
How much do you want?

49:10.322 --> 49:11.531
How much are you thinking?

49:16.536 --> 49:17.621
This is for you.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.292
What is this?

49:24.711 --> 49:26.963
It's the money I asked for before.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.257
I'd like to return it.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.009
Why are you returning it?

49:32.469 --> 49:35.055
It was something
I should never have accepted.

49:36.723 --> 49:40.102
I wanted to leave it
for my child in case I die.

49:40.977 --> 49:42.062
But?

49:44.356 --> 49:46.191
I would've been ashamed as her mom

49:47.734 --> 49:50.070
if my child grew up with this money.

49:52.489 --> 49:54.991
Even if I don't have much time left,

49:55.784 --> 49:57.828
this wasn't the right thing to do.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.248
I want to be a mom

50:01.790 --> 50:03.875
that my child can be proud of.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.423
I'm sorry. Please take it back.

50:10.549 --> 50:13.593
And I don't need any money for
what you want me to do this time.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.806
If it will clear Mr. Han's name,

50:19.141 --> 50:21.268
I can sign anything.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.815
AFFIDAVIT

50:32.404 --> 50:33.447
KANG HYE-SU

50:33.530 --> 50:34.573
Then

50:35.282 --> 50:36.700
what do you want?

50:37.409 --> 50:38.618
I don't want anything.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.581
I'm doing this to save him.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.085
I hope this helps.

50:50.046 --> 50:51.131
Have a nice day.

51:09.649 --> 51:10.734
When did you come?

51:12.194 --> 51:13.278
Are you okay?

51:18.992 --> 51:20.202
Who sent this?

51:23.121 --> 51:24.289
Your dad.

51:25.123 --> 51:26.208
Dad?

51:27.292 --> 51:29.586
First he tells me to die,
and now he sends me flowers.

51:32.130 --> 51:34.299
Your uncle told me that
your father has a favor to ask.

51:35.884 --> 51:38.553
I'm sure it's about you.

51:45.227 --> 51:46.728
What did you see in him?

51:50.565 --> 51:52.275
Back then,

51:53.610 --> 51:55.070
he wasn't that bad.

51:57.155 --> 51:59.616
He had an innocent side to him.

52:03.411 --> 52:04.788
What do you think

52:05.247 --> 52:06.748
made him that way?

52:11.086 --> 52:12.546
It was after he succeeded.

52:14.589 --> 52:17.634
He gained a lot from his success
which meant that he had more to lose.

52:20.554 --> 52:21.763
When someone

52:23.765 --> 52:25.809
has a lot they need to protect,

52:27.060 --> 52:29.813
they tend to forget

52:30.313 --> 52:31.565
what is truly precious.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.615
Ji-hun.

52:43.618 --> 52:44.870
Don't become like that.

53:05.348 --> 53:06.641
Is there no way

53:06.975 --> 53:08.184
she can get surgery?

53:08.560 --> 53:09.811
Is there absolutely no way?

53:11.563 --> 53:14.149
It's too dangerous for now.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.611
If the tumor shrinks,

53:17.944 --> 53:19.696
we can discuss it then.

53:19.988 --> 53:21.573
What's the likelihood of it shrinking?

53:21.907 --> 53:23.241
Is it even shrinking at all?

53:23.825 --> 53:27.579
To be honest, the radiotherapy hasn't
been that effective yet.

53:35.503 --> 53:36.588
This is

53:38.006 --> 53:40.091
the diagnosis from the States.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.344
Could you take a look at it
for your reference?

53:42.510 --> 53:44.679
I already took a look at it
when your wife showed it to me.

53:44.846 --> 53:45.931
Didn't she tell you?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.558
What do you mean?

53:48.767 --> 53:50.894
She brought it to me yesterday.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.188
I already discussed it with her.

53:54.814 --> 53:56.024
She brought this with her?

53:56.483 --> 53:57.692
Yes, this was it.

53:59.152 --> 54:01.196
Didn't you see her?

54:02.238 --> 54:03.406
Are you sure you're her husband?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.124
Hang in there.

54:13.625 --> 54:14.709
Okay.

54:15.919 --> 54:17.003
Bring in the next patient.

54:17.629 --> 54:18.880
Mr. Jung Seung-yong.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.134
Hello, Dr. Kim. This is Han Ji-hun.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.553
Did you meet my dad, by any chance?

54:29.182 --> 54:31.267
I see. I'll call you later.

54:46.324 --> 54:47.450
She confessed.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.329
What?

54:51.663 --> 54:53.832
She admitted to what she did.

54:54.374 --> 54:55.875
I heard she signed an affidavit
saying that

54:56.001 --> 54:58.086
she conned you into the fake marriage
and organ trafficking.

54:58.378 --> 55:00.171
What? An affidavit?

55:00.797 --> 55:02.215
Don't play dumb.

55:02.298 --> 55:04.467
You're trying to sneak out
of taking the blame through this.

55:04.676 --> 55:05.844
You're the one that planned it.

55:06.469 --> 55:08.555
You pretended to care about her,
yet you make her do this?

55:09.055 --> 55:10.682
Why not just have her locked up?

55:13.018 --> 55:15.061
Dad called a board meeting
to clarify the situation.

55:15.937 --> 55:17.313
Why don't you go and see for yourself?

55:17.772 --> 55:19.774
He told me not to attend.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.569
He probably didn't want me there,

55:22.652 --> 55:24.320
since this is disgracing our family.

55:29.034 --> 55:30.118
Gosh, that...

55:32.704 --> 55:35.123
"I approached the victim, Han Ji-hun,

55:35.623 --> 55:38.334
in order to solicit money from him.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.462
I confess my actions

55:40.712 --> 55:43.089
and repent my wrongdoings.

55:43.715 --> 55:47.052
While the fraud
was not followed through with,

55:47.260 --> 55:49.596
I will accept any punishment I deserve.

55:49.888 --> 55:53.058
I apologize sincerely for the trouble
I have caused to the company."

55:53.600 --> 55:57.437
Her signature is on the bottom here.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.564
You may pass it around and take a look.

55:59.647 --> 56:00.774
Director Choi, take a look.

56:00.857 --> 56:02.108
Here.

56:06.029 --> 56:09.824
Our executive director, Han Ji-hun,
must be here to explain it himself.

56:10.158 --> 56:11.242
Good.

56:11.451 --> 56:14.537
We'll be right back
after a short discussion. Let's talk.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.498
-Please have a seat.
-Let's talk outside.

56:16.581 --> 56:17.582
Have a seat.

56:18.166 --> 56:19.542
Okay. Sure.

56:30.637 --> 56:31.971
This is not true.

56:37.685 --> 56:39.020
I will explain

56:39.521 --> 56:40.605
what happened,

56:41.564 --> 56:42.857
since it was solely my doing.

56:44.984 --> 56:46.486
She did nothing wrong.

56:46.861 --> 56:48.988
I was the one who initiated
the organ sale,

56:49.489 --> 56:50.573
knowing it was illegal.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.660
I needed it, so I bribed her with money.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.210
I apologize sincerely

57:03.294 --> 57:04.546
for causing damage to the company.

57:05.672 --> 57:07.132
I will take full responsibility

57:08.675 --> 57:09.884
and leave the company.

57:26.192 --> 57:27.485
You fool.

57:28.194 --> 57:29.279
Have you lost your mind?

57:31.239 --> 57:34.325
Did you give this to Hye-su?

57:36.035 --> 57:37.579
Did she tattle already?

57:39.998 --> 57:41.082
Why did you do it?

57:41.541 --> 57:42.917
She didn't tell you that part?

57:43.793 --> 57:45.420
When did you get the affidavit?

57:46.212 --> 57:47.297
You idiot.

57:47.672 --> 57:49.048
You should be thanking me

57:49.924 --> 57:51.468
instead of accusing me.

57:53.178 --> 57:55.096
What did you say to her?

57:55.180 --> 57:57.891
Why are you so obsessed
with a girl who is about to die?

57:59.809 --> 58:00.935
I told her to do

58:01.519 --> 58:03.188
some good deeds before she dies.

58:03.605 --> 58:04.689
Why?

58:05.940 --> 58:07.775
She really is an outrageous girl.

58:08.401 --> 58:11.696
She took my money willingly,
but then she brought it all back.

58:12.780 --> 58:14.491
She's unbelievable.

58:14.949 --> 58:17.619
But then again,
I'm sure you were the big fish.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.371
I'm sure she regrets

58:20.872 --> 58:21.956
divorcing you

58:22.749 --> 58:24.542
when she thinks about the inheritance.

58:25.126 --> 58:26.085
Dad.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.837
She is dying,

58:28.046 --> 58:29.547
yet her greed knows no bounds.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.593
I guess it's human nature.

58:33.843 --> 58:34.928
Dad.

58:36.137 --> 58:37.222
How...

58:38.389 --> 58:39.849
How could you do such a thing?

58:41.809 --> 58:43.561
How can I face her now?

58:44.687 --> 58:47.023
-How can I face her?
-You naive idiot.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.275
When will you ever learn?

58:49.901 --> 58:52.028
I tried so hard for you.

58:52.362 --> 58:53.738
Why can't you see that?

58:54.030 --> 58:55.782
Do you know how upset I am?

58:56.491 --> 58:58.159
I'm doing this all for you.

58:58.493 --> 58:59.577
I'm trying to save you.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.540
I don't need any of that.

59:04.457 --> 59:06.459
It's only fair
that I should pay for my sins.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.212
This matter decides whether or not
this company becomes yours.

59:09.796 --> 59:12.006
Will you ruin your life for some girl?

59:12.257 --> 59:13.758
What are you going to do about this now?

59:13.925 --> 59:14.884
Dad.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.679
Do you need to lose everything
for you to come to your senses?

59:18.054 --> 59:20.807
You have no idea how scary
the world is, do you?

59:23.726 --> 59:25.019
I'll lose everything.

59:25.603 --> 59:27.814
Take everything away from me.
I'll go out into this scary world.

59:28.690 --> 59:29.857
No matter how scary it is,

59:32.652 --> 59:34.696
it can't be as scary as you are.

59:41.911 --> 59:42.996
Goodbye.

59:47.208 --> 59:48.293
Fine.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.961
You are no longer my son.

59:50.628 --> 59:52.255
Don't show dare your face ever again!

1:00:15.278 --> 1:00:16.863
Watch your step as you exit the vehicle.

1:00:16.988 --> 1:00:18.281
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:19.616
-Eun-seong, come down.
-Careful.

1:00:19.991 --> 1:00:21.451
Okay, let's say goodbye.

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:23.453
-Goodbye, Eun-seong.
-Goodbye.

1:00:23.536 --> 1:00:25.163
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:27.206
Eun-seong,

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:29.125
-did you have fun today?
-Yes.

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:30.835
Do you want to go ride a bike today?

1:00:30.918 --> 1:00:32.003
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:00:32.837 --> 1:00:33.880
Say bye to Auntie.

1:00:33.963 --> 1:00:35.131
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:36.841
Have fun.

1:00:36.924 --> 1:00:37.884
Let's go.

1:01:15.338 --> 1:01:16.547
When did you get here?

1:02:23.906 --> 1:02:24.991
All right.

1:02:25.199 --> 1:02:27.201
Let me give you a hug

1:02:28.119 --> 1:02:29.746
and let's give your mom a hug.

1:02:29.829 --> 1:02:31.706
I'll hug you both.

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:43.694
