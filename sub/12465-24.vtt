On my favorite tv show,
<i>linda and heather,</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:22.040
The rascally little brother
turned his refrigerator
into a time machine.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.077
I tried to do
the same thing
to our fridge.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.446
It did not go well.

go well at all.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.050

02:32.052 --> 02:34.386

02:34.388 --> 02:36.822
They found it
four blocks away.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.790
He still ate it.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.794
Mom and dad punished me
with a month of no tv,

02:42.796 --> 02:45.397
No computer,
no video games.

02:45.399 --> 02:49.635
Also, the government
confiscated a good portion
of my home laboratory.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.471
Don't copy
what you see on tv, yo.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.107
Maddie, i'm really proud
of how you battled back

02:55.109 --> 02:57.409
From that knee injury.
And now look at you--

03:04.685 --> 03:06.518
Good. Bank that feeling,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.954

to your rally.

-What?
-<i> Linda and heather's</i>

But, maddie,
it's a parade.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.433
Nope. Not a parade.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.402
Just the boy who broke
my daughter's heart.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.072
Diggie is going away to be
an exchange student again,

04:00.074 --> 04:02.808
And it's actually
why we broke up.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.676

to say goodbye to me,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.645
But i don't think
i could handle that.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.781

there's a new man in my life,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.984

Hey, it's not

06:04.098 --> 06:06.598
It's basketball
that happens to be played
by young women.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.201
You want
a boys' black eye?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.705

06:13.707 --> 06:16.908
-His name is fat neck.
-'cause of his big fat neck?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.911
-Are you neck-shaming my rabbit?
-His neck is very handsome, sir.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.215
I gotta go change
into my porcupine fan gear.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.751
-Will you watch
fat neck for me?
-Awesome!

06:25.753 --> 06:28.620
You wanna hang
with uncle jo-jo?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.188
Yes, you do-do.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.725
-(inhales sharply)
-i hate it when people
talk to pets.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.695
You have a lot of rules
that i am not up to speed on.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.264
Well, here's
the most important rule:

06:39.266 --> 06:41.733
If anything happens
to my rabbit,

06:41.735 --> 06:43.235
I will be irritated,

06:43.237 --> 06:46.037
There-to-fore i will
lash out at people,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.773
<i>Ergo</i> , you.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.843
I'll be right back,
my fat fuzzy wuzzy!

06:51.845 --> 06:54.146
-I thought you hated--
-it's different when i do it.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.682

don't you worry,
mr. Dump truck sir!

06:57.684 --> 06:59.951

Hands!

07:01.989 --> 07:03.588
Oh no.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.795
(panting)
i ran here as soon
as i got your text.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.598
I only use my phone
to contact my mother
and pediatrician.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.203
But when i saw
reggie running
down the street, shouting,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.938
(mimics)
"i'm coming, dr. P,"

07:19.940 --> 07:21.706
It seemed prudent
to follow.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.078
You ready for
a <i> linda and heather </i> marathon?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.647
What do you think?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.784
Both:
Boom, chicken soup!

07:32.786 --> 07:34.986
We get to have soup? Yes!

07:34.988 --> 07:38.690
No, that's something
linda and heather say
on our favorite show.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.624
My bad, dawg.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.962
And mother just allowed me
to start watching tv,

07:43.964 --> 07:46.798
I haven't had
the courage to do it yet,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.233
But today's the day.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.171
Evan, all you need to know is
linda and heather are besties,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.240
And in the last episode
reggie and i saw,

07:55.242 --> 07:59.778
Linda was invited
to be the first teenager on
the international space station.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.013
Do you think
she'll take heather with her

08:02.015 --> 08:04.683
Or her vampire
boyfriend, steve?

08:04.685 --> 08:07.352
Reggie,
she's not taking steve.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.653
Heather's her b.F.F.,

08:08.655 --> 08:10.722
And b.F.F.'s have
each other's back.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.658
You know, like how you didn't
watch <i> linda and heather</i>
for the last month,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.794
Because i wasn't
allowed to watch it.

08:15.796 --> 08:19.698
Please! I gotta have
my boy to watch my show
about my girls.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.484
(both mimic explosion)

08:22.485 --> 08:25.269
Okay, we have to watch
all four episodes we missed
before the finale airs.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.839
No time for breaks,
so our butts are stapled

08:27.841 --> 08:29.341
To this couch
for the rest of the night,

08:29.343 --> 08:31.710
But what
if i need a drink?

08:31.712 --> 08:35.680
My mom said i could
only come over if i kept
myself properly hydrated.

08:36.984 --> 08:40.085
Please, you're
in dr. P's world now.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.821
This is hooked up
to lemonade...

08:44.691 --> 08:45.924
Chocolate milk...

08:47.694 --> 08:49.861
And guacamole
for our chips!

08:50.831 --> 08:54.032
We get to have chips?
The forbidden fruit?

08:55.702 --> 08:58.436
I was saving this
for christmas, but...

08:58.438 --> 09:00.138
Today's more important.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.808
(christmas music playing)

09:09.283 --> 09:11.750
God bless us, everyone.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.755
Oh! Okay,
the parade is coming.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.356
Sticky tape down, people!

09:18.358 --> 09:21.259
-(cheering)
-come on, folks!

09:21.261 --> 09:25.063
This victory parade
just turned into
a victory rally

09:25.065 --> 09:27.299
On channel four!
So don't dally,

09:27.301 --> 09:29.768
-Get down to that rally!
-(cheering continues)

09:33.040 --> 09:35.206
Maddie! Maddie, maddie!

09:35.208 --> 09:37.375
Hey, i just--
i have to talk to you
for a quick...

09:39.746 --> 09:40.912
Second.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.384
-Hi, liv.
-(clears throat) diggie.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.789
I have been...
Icing you out

09:50.791 --> 09:53.024
In a show
of sisterly solidarity.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.861
Bet you felt that chill.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.266
Why do you need
to talk to maddie so bad?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.903
'cause i made a stupid mistake
when i broke up with her.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.339
(laughs)
yeah, you did.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.809
(sighs)
what's up?

10:11.812 --> 10:15.080
I woke up this morning,
ready to go to australia...

10:16.149 --> 10:19.951
But it just hit me
how hard being away
from maddie is gonna be.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.854
I don't know
if i should go.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.289
What are you saying?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.293
I want to get
back together with her.

10:28.295 --> 10:32.230
-Whoa.
-Okay, but, liv, do you think
that she'd take me back?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.799
Because if she will,
i'm not gonna leave.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.369
(laughs)
no, i mean, diggie,
this is huge.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.871
I can't answer that for you.
You're gonna have to
ask her yourself.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.340
(scoffs)
i have been trying all day.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.476
I leave for the airport
in a half an hour.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.911
What? Um...

10:46.913 --> 10:48.179
Okay, you know what?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.914
You just sit
by the paulie statue,

10:49.916 --> 10:52.517
And i will go get maddie
before you leave.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.551
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.887
-Okay, great. Thank you.
-Oh! Um...

10:57.424 --> 11:00.158
You're gonna fix
your hair before
maddie comes back, right?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.829
What? I thought
it looked good.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.400
You're gonna fix your hair...

11:09.870 --> 11:11.469
Before maddie comes back.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.073
Right?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.241
Okay.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.312
(cheering)

11:25.585 --> 11:27.852
Let's go, porcupines!

11:35.962 --> 11:37.996
Where's my bunny?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.964
What did joey do
with my bunny?

11:42.302 --> 11:45.136
Hippety-hop,
that geek is gonna drop.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.874
Nimbus over p.A.:
<i>Please welcome #4,</i>
<i>brie martucci!</i>

11:49.876 --> 11:52.243
(cheering)

11:52.245 --> 11:55.180
Oh, good. Maddie,

11:55.182 --> 11:58.083
Diggie really
needs to talk to you,
and it is huge news.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.351
Okay, liv, i'm actually
too busy celebrating

12:00.353 --> 12:01.886
With people who want
to be in my life

12:01.888 --> 12:03.555
To talk to somebody
who doesn't.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.224
Nimbus:
<i>#9, kat montenegro!</i>

12:07.894 --> 12:09.928
Okay, maddie,
i really, really wanted you
to hear this from diggie,

12:09.930 --> 12:12.330
But he says he's going
to stay if you tell him to.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.032
Maddie and willow: What?

12:14.034 --> 12:16.301
Oh, johnny just
announced kat.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.271
You guys are talking
about something else.
Sorry.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.309
Maddie! He wants to get
back together with you!

12:24.311 --> 12:27.011
I mean, obviously,
if that's what you want,
but that is...

12:27.013 --> 12:28.913
What you want, right?

12:28.915 --> 12:29.948
(chuckles)

12:31.084 --> 12:34.018
I mean, yeah, it was,

12:34.020 --> 12:36.054
But i guess i kinda gave up
on that ever happening,

12:36.056 --> 12:37.989
So... (chuckles)

12:38.959 --> 12:41.059
I don't know. Maybe.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.928
Well, then, maddie,
you have to get out there
and talk to him,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.663
'cause he's waiting for you
at the paulie statue,

12:45.665 --> 12:47.365
But he's gonna leave
for the airport in 10 minutes.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.034
Nimbus:
<i>#19, samantha myman!</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:52.504
-Whoo!
-Yay!

12:52.505 --> 12:54.973
Okay, liv, there is
an entire townful of people
waiting for me in that gym.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.009
It's not like
i can be in two places
at the same time,

12:58.011 --> 13:00.478
Maybe there's
a way that you can.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.147
(gasps)
there is?

13:02.149 --> 13:05.083
Nimbus:
#8, lacey sullenger!

13:05.085 --> 13:06.951
I'll explain it
to you later,
sweetie, okay?

13:08.255 --> 13:12.090
Okay. Maddie,
give me your uniform
and your spare pair of glasses,

13:12.092 --> 13:14.092
I will go to the rally,
you go get diggie,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.194
And, willow,
can you just stall
so i have time to change?

13:16.196 --> 13:17.729
-Got it.
-Okay, great.

13:17.731 --> 13:21.132
Nimbus:
#44, mrs. Joey rooney!

13:22.435 --> 13:25.303
What? They asked
how i wanted
to be introduced.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.604
It's my big day.

13:30.043 --> 13:34.379
There she is! And now,
your team captain--

13:34.381 --> 13:37.048
-Maddie roone--
-actually... (laughs)

13:37.050 --> 13:39.818
I think-- before
we bring maddie out,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.587
I think everyone would love
to hear one of your famous
weather poems, johnny!

13:42.589 --> 13:45.757
Oh no, no, i couldn't.
It's not the right time or--

13:45.759 --> 13:47.625
Hickory dickory dock,

13:47.627 --> 13:50.128
The temperature's
starting to drop.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.763
Hickory dickory dizzle,

13:51.765 --> 13:53.765
Outside, it's starting
to drizzle.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.167
Thunder goes boom,
lightning--

13:56.169 --> 13:58.603
Give it up
for maddie rooney!

13:58.605 --> 14:01.072
(cheering)

14:05.111 --> 14:06.110
(thuds)

14:08.081 --> 14:10.381
Oh! You-- oh.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.084
Hi!
(chuckles)

14:13.086 --> 14:15.553
I would like
to thank...

14:15.555 --> 14:17.655
The academy...

14:19.059 --> 14:23.795
Um, johnny,
how about another one
of those weather poems?

14:23.797 --> 14:26.497
Oh no, i couldn't.
No one wants to hear--

14:26.499 --> 14:29.467
Roses are red,
violets are blue,

14:29.469 --> 14:32.337
The high on tuesday
was 72!

14:32.339 --> 14:34.239
(snapping fingers)

14:37.477 --> 14:39.410
This episode is epic!

14:39.412 --> 14:41.045
I can't wait
for the season finale

14:41.047 --> 14:43.381
On the international
space station.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.184
Dare i say it?
I'm a little giddy.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.354
Wait until you see
the end of this episode,

14:49.356 --> 14:51.589
When the girls catch
the phantom break dancer.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.592
He's the b-boy
that you can't see, boy!

14:54.594 --> 14:56.828
(chattering on tv)

14:56.830 --> 15:00.732
Wait. How do you
know how they catch
the phantom break dancer?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.468
(gasps) you watched
this episode without me!

15:04.437 --> 15:07.338
I'm sorry.
I watched all the episodes.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.275
It's the phantom
break dancer, parker!

15:10.277 --> 15:11.743
How could i turn away!

15:11.745 --> 15:14.178
I thought
we were friends.

15:14.180 --> 15:17.181
Why should
i be punished because
you blew up your fridge?

15:17.183 --> 15:19.717
I was building
that time machine for us!

15:24.758 --> 15:27.792
-Hey!
-(whimpers) okay.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.630
Did i not
recently entrust you

15:32.632 --> 15:35.199
With the most precious
thing i possess?

15:35.201 --> 15:38.603
(chuckles nervously)
i mean, can you really
possess a pet?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.238
I mean, in some ways,
they own us.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.173
-Zip it!
-Okay.

15:43.410 --> 15:48.379
-Did you lose
my beloved bunny?
-Okay, i did lose him,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.682
But then i spotted him,

15:50.684 --> 15:52.750
But then
he went somewhere

15:52.752 --> 15:55.787
Where i could not
get to him, so i was just...

15:56.723 --> 15:58.289
Fleeing for my life.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.862
What do you mean,
you couldn't get to him?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.899
He hopped into
the girls' locker room.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.472
(laughs)

16:14.474 --> 16:16.808
Fat neck, you sly dog.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.995
Go get him.

16:20.996 --> 16:23.146
Mr. Truck, i can't just go
into the girls' locker room!

16:23.149 --> 16:27.218
Well, either you go
into that locker room
and you grab my rabbit,

16:27.220 --> 16:30.488
Or i go into your chest,
and i grab your heart.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.325
To the girls'
locker room i go!

16:36.696 --> 16:38.896
Okay. (sighs)

16:38.898 --> 16:40.732
What are you gonna say
when you see him?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.233
(clears throat,
high-pitched) 'sup?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.852
(clears throat,
low-pitched) 'sup?

16:43.853 --> 16:45.470
(clears throat,
normal voice) 'sup?
That's the one. Let's go.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.704
-(door opens)
-joey: Oh. Oh.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.607
Excuse me. Excuse--

16:49.609 --> 16:52.343
Ladies, i am not
a sneaky-peeker!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.245
I am just looking
for my giant rabbit!

16:54.247 --> 16:56.247
Joey, get out
of the girls' locker room!

16:56.249 --> 16:58.249
-(shrieks)
-(banging)

16:58.251 --> 17:01.285
Oh. Ooh.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.721
Joey! What did
you just do?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.857
What? No, i didn't
mean to do that!

17:05.859 --> 17:08.526
You startled me,
so i just jumped
back like this.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.797
(angrily)
are you kidding me?

17:12.799 --> 17:16.601
-Joey, i am gonna kill you!
-Why are you so upset?

17:16.603 --> 17:19.804
(gasps)
oh, i found fat neck.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.473
Hey, fat neck.
I am saved.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.443
Just gotta get him
to dump truck.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.213
Oh! We can't get out.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.851
Now i get it. I'm gonna
go ahead and say it.
That's my bad.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.891
(cheering)

17:40.827 --> 17:42.894
What on earth
are you doing, liv?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.396
What?
(deeper voice) liv?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.565
No, mom.
It's me, maddie.

17:48.802 --> 17:52.403
Really? Name one
female sports star.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.807
Umm...
(mouths)

17:57.277 --> 18:00.278
Beyonce likes
to soulcycle.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.348
(normal voice)
okay, fine, you got me.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.783
Maddie and i switched
so that she could

18:05.785 --> 18:07.952
Go talk to diggie
before he leaves
for australia.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.921
He wants to get
back together with her!

18:09.923 --> 18:13.024
Well, a lie for love negates
all of my disapproval.

18:13.026 --> 18:17.295
But remember,
you can never get one
past your parents.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.430
-We will always know.
-Okay.

18:19.432 --> 18:23.301
Maddie.
You're up next!

18:23.303 --> 18:25.770
I'm so proud
of you, maddie!

18:25.772 --> 18:27.705
-(chuckles)
-hey, ridgewood!

18:27.707 --> 18:30.508
Who wants to hear
maddie rooney talk
about that winning shot?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.843
-(cheering)
-huh? Oh!

18:31.845 --> 18:34.045
-(chuckles nervously)
-oh, these folks do.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.948
Oh, i have to talk
about the basketball-y stuff?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.317
Okay. Willow,
you go get maddie.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.785
Mama's got this.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.820
You know...

18:42.822 --> 18:45.923
Before maddie speaks,
i think it's time

18:45.925 --> 18:51.295
For vice principal rooney's
state championship rally
flag extravaganza.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.630
Maestro?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.699
(dramatic music playing)

19:01.641 --> 19:03.541
(squeaking)

19:10.483 --> 19:12.416
(chattering on tv)

19:12.418 --> 19:15.419
Reggie:
Can i please watch
<i>linda and heather?</i>

19:17.690 --> 19:19.390
You saw this one
already, traitor.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.359
You've earned
that bucket of shame.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.364
So, friend who did not
betray my trust,

19:30.403 --> 19:31.702
Who do you think
linda will take

19:31.704 --> 19:33.638
To the international
space station?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.541
Heather or steve the vampire?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.977
I'm afraid
to express an opinion,

19:39.979 --> 19:42.480
For fear that
i will get a bucket, too.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.417
Mark my words, evan,
linda will take heather.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.420
I know my girl,
and my girl will
take her girl...

19:49.422 --> 19:52.356
Who is also my girl.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.961
Heather:
<i>Linda, i shouldn't</i>
<i>have lied to you.</i>

19:56.963 --> 19:59.463
Linda:
<i>But you're</i>
<i>my friend, heather.</i>

19:59.465 --> 20:01.732
<i>Friends forgive friends.</i>

20:01.734 --> 20:03.968
<i>(gasps)</i>
<i>bestie hugs!</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:09.507
Wow.
When the whacky hijinks end,

20:09.509 --> 20:11.442
This show makes
me think about life.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.412
Reggie,
take that bucket off

20:14.414 --> 20:17.381
And give me
a <i> linda and heather</i>
bestie hug, you big dummy.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.955
Both: Besties!

20:27.093 --> 20:28.893
(grunts)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.595
(distant cheering)

20:30.597 --> 20:32.430
Diggie is gonna leave
any minute

20:32.432 --> 20:34.165
And i have to get
to the paulie statue!

20:34.167 --> 20:35.967
Why don't you
just text him?

20:35.969 --> 20:38.469
(scoffs, chuckles)

20:38.471 --> 20:41.539
Because my phone is trapped
inside the lockers

20:41.541 --> 20:43.107
That you just knocked over.

20:43.109 --> 20:46.043
Shh! You're
upsetting fat neck.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.481
Maddie?
Are you okay?

20:50.483 --> 20:52.483
Willow!
I have to get to diggie,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.518
And i'm trapped in here.
Please help!

20:54.520 --> 20:57.421
-(pounds)
-(grunts)

20:57.423 --> 20:59.757
I'm sorry, maddie.
It's not budging.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.493
It would take
five guys to lift these.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.563
Great! I can't believe
you trapped us in here, joey.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.665
(gasps)
joey's in there?

21:09.969 --> 21:13.571
(grunts, yells)

21:16.142 --> 21:17.608
Thanks, willow!

21:17.610 --> 21:21.646
-Thanks, willow.
-You're safe now, munchkin!

21:23.216 --> 21:26.550
Diggie! Diggie,
am i too late?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.928
-(chattering on tv)
-(yells) we're back!

21:37.930 --> 21:40.631
Shh!
No talking!

21:40.633 --> 21:43.701
It's the season finale!
He's tense.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.938
Heather:
<i>Linda, have you made</i>
<i>your decision?</i>

21:47.940 --> 21:50.608
-Linda:
<i>I have, heather.</i>
-(gasps)

21:50.610 --> 21:53.110
This is it!
This is the moment!

21:54.514 --> 21:56.480
Linda: <i> The person</i>
<i>i want to join me</i>

21:56.482 --> 21:59.917
<i>On the international</i>
<i>space station is...</i>

22:00.920 --> 22:03.054
"to be continued."

22:03.056 --> 22:07.491
Both: No...!

22:07.493 --> 22:09.593
(yells) what's happening?

22:10.897 --> 22:13.564
Dude, we got cliff-hangered!

22:13.566 --> 22:15.733
Evan, honey,
sometimes a show
ends a season

22:15.735 --> 22:16.934
With an unfinished moment

22:16.936 --> 22:18.936
To bring viewers back in
for the next season.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.606
My mom was right!
Television is a demon box!

22:23.576 --> 22:25.576
Dr. P! What are we gonna do?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.578
We are gonna sit on this couch

22:27.580 --> 22:29.213
