WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:12.180
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:17.185
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.728 --> 00:22.398
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:28.654
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:34.744
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.292 --> 00:45.296
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:32.551 --> 01:35.388
Look. he's come back to us!

01:40.810 --> 01:42.978
Who you burying
in such fine style?

01:47.274 --> 01:48.651
Your brother.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.672
How did he die?

02:09.839 --> 02:10.840
No one knows.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.467
It was so sudden, Alfred, he...

02:14.635 --> 02:17.930
One moment he was well
and then he collapsed, and...

02:18.264 --> 02:19.724
It was terrible.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.314
I can't believe this.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.233
Thank God, you've recovered!

02:30.901 --> 02:33.279
We were so scared
to lose the both of you.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.095
Hail and farewell, my brother.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.641
Hail and farewell.

03:37.343 --> 03:38.761
Father!

03:39.303 --> 03:41.138
Father! Father!

03:44.809 --> 03:45.851
Mother!

03:48.145 --> 03:50.272
Helgi.
My son!

03:50.689 --> 03:51.941
My son!
Father.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.569
<i>Mm: w 30!â€œ
RAF ARTA: w mm!</i>

04:01.909 --> 04:03.077
<i>ON.!</i>

04:08.624 --> 04:11.836
Helgi!

04:12.044 --> 04:13.838
Ketill, my friend.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.714
Come.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.635
Come. You see how I am?
Come, let me thank you.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.930
Oh, thank the gods!

04:23.848 --> 04:25.432
You have saved us.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.769
You had no cause to do it,
but you have done it.

04:30.396 --> 04:31.689
Floki was right.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.483
We have all changed.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.238
My friend.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.541
I wish we had something
to celebrate with.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.002
Oh, we do.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.590
So let's celebrate.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.186
Thank you.

05:33.626 --> 05:35.002
Make way.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.273
My people.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.193
You are all welcome
to the Thing.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.695
It is important to us

06:01.779 --> 06:04.114
that everyone here
feels involved

06:04.198 --> 06:05.824
in the life of our great town.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.743
Kattegat is grown.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.662
It is now a huge
trading station.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.290
The greatest trading station
in Scandinavia.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.252
Kattegat has changed
since my father's time.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.923
In those days, he knew everyone

06:21.256 --> 06:23.550
and he was happy
to share his power

06:23.634 --> 06:25.803
with those he knew
and trusted, of course.

06:28.305 --> 06:32.351
My father gave me
this responsibility

06:32.434 --> 06:36.438
and our father, Odin,
gave me this responsibility.

06:36.522 --> 06:39.233
I've accepted it,
and I ask you to trust me.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.071
We cannot allow everyone to vote

06:44.154 --> 06:46.740
on everything
which affects our kingdom.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.828
We have a duty to protect it.
I have a duty to protect it.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.881
So, we have to change the rules.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.394
What are you doing?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.229
Packing your things, my dear.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.690
Your husband is dead, you've
no reason to remain here,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.276
unless of course,
you are with child.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.739
Otherwise you must return home

07:26.822 --> 07:28.741
to your mother,
I really am very sorry.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
I don't think
you're sorry at all.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.413
I think that you control
everything that happens here.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.124
If only that were true.

07:38.167 --> 07:42.504
You don't seem very sorry that my
husband and your son died so suddenly.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.090
And I don't know
what to make of that.

07:46.300 --> 07:51.138
You don't need to make anything
of that, my dear child.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.974
Life is complicated enough,

07:54.057 --> 07:57.060
and you are young enough
to find another husband.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.941
Well, then I hope his mother
is nothing like you.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.237
My dear, he should be so lucky.

08:11.325 --> 08:15.204
People I trust,
will vote on land issues,

08:15.287 --> 08:19.041
matrimonial matters,
murder inquiries.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.043
Things that you do not need
to worry about.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.129
Because I will take care of you.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.048
I will lead you!

08:26.632 --> 08:30.010
Now, what is truly important
is to know who we are

08:30.260 --> 08:33.847
and who is with us
and who is against us.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.683
And we know who
we are, don't we?

08:36.767 --> 08:38.227
Yeah!

08:38.310 --> 08:39.645
Yes, we do.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.439
So, now, it is time
to find out those

08:42.523 --> 08:45.192
who threaten us,
who is against us.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.238
Maybe it is your neighbor.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.034
Perhaps it is someone you know.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.869
A family member.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.914
A brother.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.042
A son.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.838
They talk about me.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.841
They whisper
that I am the enemy.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.054
But, of course,
they are the enemy.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.015
They want to destroy
our kingdom.

09:17.099 --> 09:20.060
They want to encourage
our enemies to attack us

09:20.143 --> 09:22.646
and invade us.
Is that what you want?

09:22.729 --> 09:23.730
No!

09:23.814 --> 09:25.440
Do you want me to protect you?

09:25.524 --> 09:26.525
Yes.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.836
Do you want me to destroy them?

09:27.860 --> 09:28.861
Yes!

09:29.403 --> 09:30.404
Yes!

09:31.905 --> 09:32.906
Yes!

09:33.574 --> 09:35.492
Destroy them.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.577
Yes.

09:40.414 --> 09:45.043
Ivar, the Boneless!
Ivar, the Boneless!

09:56.555 --> 09:58.015
Why is Elsewith not here?

09:59.391 --> 10:00.851
And Ethelfled?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.979
I thought we should talk.
You and I.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.316
It's not been easy
since you fell sick.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.067
I had to deal with the traitors.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
They were still
plotting against you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.406
Perhaps they still are.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.079
And...

10:22.581 --> 10:23.999
I had to deal with your brother.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.586
My brother?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.465
What exactly does that mean?

10:33.967 --> 10:34.968
It means...

10:37.554 --> 10:39.848
His death wasn't natural.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.274
You had better explain.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.652
And quickly.

10:51.902 --> 10:55.781
He had plotted against you
before, Alfred, he told me.

10:56.615 --> 10:57.616
He confessed.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.244
And then he said he would
never plot against you again,

11:01.328 --> 11:04.122
but I satisfied myself
he was lying.

11:05.916 --> 11:10.879
I knew, as long as he was
alive, he would do anything.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.676
Join any plot, any conspiracy

11:15.759 --> 11:18.053
that promised to make him king.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.727
He thought you had usurped him,

11:25.811 --> 11:28.814
and he could never,
ever forgive you.

11:32.901 --> 11:33.902
So?

11:39.116 --> 11:40.450
I poisoned him.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.497
I killed one of my sons

11:47.124 --> 11:48.458
to save the other.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.547
May God forgive me.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.800
Can we talk now?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.722
You've awoken from along sleep

12:43.805 --> 12:46.475
and seemed to have forgotten
that you're a king.

12:47.517 --> 12:51.188
You are behaving as if you
were an ordinary person.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.609
You grieve as if you were
an ordinary person.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.861
You show your feelings

12:57.944 --> 13:00.489
as if you were
an ordinary person,

13:00.572 --> 13:01.948
but all of that must stop.

13:05.952 --> 13:11.083
A king cannot be like
an ordinary person,

13:13.168 --> 13:18.131
must not behave orhavefeenngs
like an ordinary person.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.887
A king must be prepared to
do the most terrible things.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.182
Things against all conscience,

13:28.767 --> 13:31.978
if he wants to survive.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.235
You saw them?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.070
Saw Who?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.532
Hvitserk and that girl.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.329
He hates me.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.790
I ought to have him killed.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.503
If I can order the death
of my own brother,

15:21.838 --> 15:24.674
then who else
will dare stand against me?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.512
I think that would be a mistake.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.561
Why?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.481
<i>Nat, you are a god.</i>

15:41.024 --> 15:42.234
And a merciful god

15:42.317 --> 15:45.070
will always be more popular
among the common people

15:45.153 --> 15:47.197
than a vengeful god, like Odin.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.289
Wouldn't you rather beloved,
than feared?

16:03.171 --> 16:04.547
I don't know.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.011
I'm not sure.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.131
Why aren't you getting ready?

16:47.007 --> 16:48.133
We have to leave.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.472
Yes, Floki, we are ready.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.769
Come on, you old witch.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.897
What? Why did you say that?

17:03.481 --> 17:06.860
Because it's true. You're
a witch and a murderess.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.195
And you deserve to die!

17:09.779 --> 17:11.906
- What are you doing?
- Mother!

17:14.117 --> 17:15.994
- Stop!
- Don't you worry, Floki.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.247
We're doing this for love.
Forthelove of my brother and sister.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.498
No!

17:21.791 --> 17:23.668
Stop this now!

17:23.960 --> 17:24.961
Don't move, Floki.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.214
No! Don't touch her.
She never killed anyone.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.511
Ketill, this is madness!

17:34.179 --> 17:37.390
No, I've thought about this
a long time, Floki.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.642
Please!

17:46.858 --> 17:48.359
I should have known.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.445
Always the good man!

17:51.780 --> 17:52.947
<i>Arse-â€œska .</i>

17:53.740 --> 17:56.326
I should've known you were
more ambitious than me.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.038
My only ambition is revenge.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.917
Ketill.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.796
Leave Eyvind and Helgi outside.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.006
Let's deal with them
in the morning.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.398
Sorry to startle you...

19:11.359 --> 19:13.570
But I have been thinking
about you, my dear brother.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.197
What have you been thinking?

19:16.281 --> 19:17.407
I have been thinking

19:18.867 --> 19:20.869
that you can make yourself
more useful to me.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.163
It concerns me that...

19:24.622 --> 19:25.790
You have no proper role here,

19:25.874 --> 19:29.502
that you live
such an empty and idle life.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.882
After all, you are my brother
and I love you.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.428
So, how could
I make myself useful?

19:40.221 --> 19:41.598
You could leave Kattegat.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.939
Go on a diplomatic trip to the Great
Hall of King Olaf, the Stout.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.774
You will cement our alliance,

19:51.858 --> 19:55.069
help him prepare for our springtime
attacks on York and Wessex.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.863
And if I refuse?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.449
I don't want to leave Kattegat.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.831
I'm afraid you cannot refuse.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.377
What is your name?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.672
There.
There!

20:17.050 --> 20:20.011
My brother has been remiss
in not introducing us.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.806
He seems very fond of you.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.808
We love each other.

20:26.684 --> 20:27.936
Hmm.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.605
That is good.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.066
That is good, Hvitserk.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.903
It would be a pity
if I had to burn her alive.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.697
You wouldn't do that, brother.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.367
Now, would you?

20:47.538 --> 20:48.706
No.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.792
No, I wouldn't...

20:52.752 --> 20:55.588
Not if you agreed to leave Kattegat
first thing in the morning.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.884
Hmm'?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.498
I'm sorry.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.543
I'm sorry I put them here.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.422
I didn't know.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.841
Don't snivel.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.593
What difference does it make?

21:44.012 --> 21:46.764
We're all just meat.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.061
It all goes to nothing.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.656
I don't understand.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.242
Of course you do.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.828
Do you really suppose
I could forgive them?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.751
I thought it was possible.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.713
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
come all the way here.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.717
You had me
believing again, Ketill.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.054
We are what we are, Floki.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.431
And the gods have made us so.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.897
You can't kill Helgi.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.360
None of this is his fault.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.823
He loved your daughter,
and he's a good man.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.993
Spare him, at least.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.915
Maybe I Will, Floki.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.211
If Helgi is still alive
in the morning,

22:58.294 --> 22:59.879
we could consider saving him.

23:02.632 --> 23:03.925
I agree.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.635
It would make us all
feel better.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.227
Shield wall.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.273
<i>Up on the overturned keel</i>

23:19.399 --> 23:23.027
<i>Clamber with hearts of steel</i>

23:23.152 --> 23:26.531
<i>Cold is the ocean's spray</i>

23:26.614 --> 23:30.076
<i>Your death is on its way</i>

23:30.159 --> 23:33.788
<i>And your death is on its way</i>

23:33.871 --> 23:36.999
<i>Your death is on its way</i>

23:54.183 --> 23:55.685
Yeah!

23:59.063 --> 24:00.940
Look at her.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.526
Yes.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.454
Be a man!

24:19.750 --> 24:21.252
- King Harald?
- Who's next?

24:21.335 --> 24:23.463
Bjorn Ironside.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.923
Come on!

24:26.966 --> 24:29.594
We need to make a plan.
I'm growing impatient.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.557
You don't mean to sail at this
time of the year, surely?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.476
It is exactly
what I intent to do.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.437
Ivar will not be
expecting our arrival.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.980
Stand up and fight.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.776
But this time of the year,
there are many storms at sea.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.405
Are you telling me you have
no fear of these storms?

24:50.156 --> 24:53.242
That you cannot imagine
that our fleet will flounder?

24:54.076 --> 24:56.037
I have no doubt that
we will have safe passage.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.748
How can you be so sure?

24:59.540 --> 25:00.666
My father told me.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.586
Your father?

25:05.129 --> 25:06.923
You mean Ragnar?
Ragnar told you?

25:07.215 --> 25:08.925
Yes. He spoke to me
in a dream.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.470
Ah, finally, a proper fight!

25:15.181 --> 25:16.599
Don't you ever dream?

25:22.522 --> 25:24.273
Yeah!

25:30.363 --> 25:33.741
Your father loved Ivar,
everyone knows that.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.826
<i>He chose Nat.
He chose me.</i>

25:37.328 --> 25:38.871
I'm his eldest son.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.374
Kattegat belongs to me.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.085
Huh.

25:46.087 --> 25:50.299
I had an arrangement with
Ivar that, after his death,

25:51.008 --> 25:52.718
I would be king of Kattegat.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.137
Well, then we will make
the same arrangement.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.266
Easy for you to say, Bjorn.

26:01.561 --> 26:06.023
But what can you swear on
to persuade me to believe you?

26:07.567 --> 26:08.985
My sacred arm ring, of course.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.528
You fight like an old woman.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.242
And then on the life
of my intended wife Gunnhild.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.911
Fight me, you weak men!

26:19.078 --> 26:21.163
She must agree
and swear to the gods

26:21.247 --> 26:22.999
that once I die,
you will become king.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.980
Whether or not
she'll want to marry you

26:28.004 --> 26:30.631
will be of no further
consequence to me.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.799
- I'll be dead.
- Weakling.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.427
But for now, King Harald...

26:36.554 --> 26:39.181
You must give the orders and
start preparing your ships.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.729
What an exciting world
we live in.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.273
What an exciting world!

26:56.324 --> 27:00.202
You will have your ships,
Bjorn Ironside.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.122
Yeah!

27:08.377 --> 27:12.173
<i>Up on {he overturned keel</i>

27:13.007 --> 27:16.635
<i>Clamber with hearts of steel</i>

27:17.428 --> 27:21.599
<i>Cold is the ocean's spray</i>

27:23.642 --> 27:27.438
<i>Your death is on its way</i>

27:27.563 --> 27:32.777
<i>And your death is on its way</i>

27:50.002 --> 27:51.629
Lower your head. old man.

27:53.047 --> 27:54.507
The ax is coming.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.301
Don't be afraid.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.389
I am not afraid.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.440
Move. Move!

28:14.568 --> 28:15.569
Move!

28:32.169 --> 28:33.379
Floki.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.845
I want to live.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.723
I've never done
anything against Ketill.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.059
I was always more on his side

28:47.143 --> 28:49.061
than Eyvind
and surely he knows that.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.315
He does know it.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.531
Come outside, Helgi.

29:34.899 --> 29:38.611
<i>Be strong though rain beats down</i>

29:39.153 --> 29:42.531
<i>Upon your balding crown</i>

29:43.032 --> 29:46.494
<i>With maidens, you had your way</i>

29:47.036 --> 29:50.289
<i>Each must die someday</i>

29:50.372 --> 29:55.002
<i>And each must die someday</i>

30:11.060 --> 30:12.770
Out of the way!

30:22.863 --> 30:24.740
My Lord!

30:24.823 --> 30:26.158
The ships of a large Viking army

30:26.242 --> 30:27.785
have been seen in West Wales.

30:27.868 --> 30:28.929
If they continue their course,

30:28.953 --> 30:31.038
they will arrive at our
borders in a matter of days.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.668
Summon a Witan.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.677
Who are they?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.345
We think they are Danes.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.350
They've sailed from their base
in Dublin across to Cornwall

30:51.475 --> 30:52.851
with at least 300 ships.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.688
Hmm.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.107
<i>You've tanked to the When,</i>

30:58.190 --> 31:00.070
you've talked to your nobles,
are they prepared?

31:00.109 --> 31:01.902
How many warriors
can they put on the field?

31:01.986 --> 31:03.028
About 2,000.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.367
The Danes will have
1,000 more warriors.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.705
I will ride myself with the head
of the army to inspire our forces.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.249
I also believe that
I have some good commanders.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.542
The Danes won't be frightened

31:16.625 --> 31:18.065
to see you
with the head of the army.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.629
Believe me.
And why do you say that?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.844
I have a terrible habit
of telling the truth.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.687
Very well.
Then what do you advise?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.690
I advise you make me
the head of your army.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.360
I think you should listen to me.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.487
Words are fine,
but they don't win battles.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.116
If you make me
the head of the army,

31:49.366 --> 31:51.410
I will find a way
of dealing with the Danes.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.747
Otherwise, you have no hope.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.605
Why do you sneak up on me?

32:20.981 --> 32:22.483
Why do you stay in the shadows?

32:23.567 --> 32:24.860
You're a king.

32:28.197 --> 32:29.490
What do you want to say?

32:31.408 --> 32:32.409
<i>Must, um...</i>

32:34.203 --> 32:35.245
Wanted to remind you

32:35.329 --> 32:37.706
that fate has
brought us together.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.715
You yourself said as much...

32:49.677 --> 32:51.303
While you were still married.

32:52.888 --> 32:56.558
I said I knew my life was going to change.
And so it has.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.648
I'm no longer the person I was.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.111
We're always the same.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.239
We just pretend to change.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.496
I see that Bjorn Ironside
has claimed you.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.916
You're mistaken.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.710
No man will ever claim me.

33:25.129 --> 33:29.883
I prefer it to think that the
gods have you and me in mind.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.553
I don't know about the gods.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.354
What do you have in mind then?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.817
Do you still want
to be king of all Norway?

33:48.861 --> 33:50.696
My ambition has never changed.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.035
Well, then...

33:58.704 --> 33:59.997
I shall like to be queen.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.192
My Lady?
What were you doing?

34:29.943 --> 34:31.069
Doesn't matter.

34:33.614 --> 34:34.865
Really doesn't matter.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.675
Father!

34:55.511 --> 34:56.512
Father!

35:30.671 --> 35:31.755
What happened?

35:33.257 --> 35:34.299
Floki?

35:35.300 --> 35:36.552
Tell me what happened.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.137
Take this.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.139
Floki.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.102
They killed them all.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.188
All of them.

35:49.064 --> 35:52.901
Your father and your brother,
they killed them all.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.989
They wanted revenge.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.658
No. And they had
planned it a long time.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.245
No!
I couldn't stop them.

36:05.414 --> 36:06.582
No.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.626
I can't believe it.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.672
What about Helgi?

36:14.298 --> 36:18.135
No, please, surely they couldn't
have killed him. Please.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.054
All of them.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.640
No!
Helgi. too.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.728
I pleaded with them. I asked
your father to spare him, but...

36:29.229 --> 36:30.397
No.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.649
No!
I'm sorry. Aud.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.484
I'm sorry.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.572
Please. no. They couldn't have.
I'm sorry.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.826
I should never have brought
you all to this place.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.552
You didn't even really
see the gods, did you?

37:17.945 --> 37:20.614
When you come back,
we should get married.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.075
Yes. We will have
lots of children.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.287
You won't be idle anymore. Oh. I
won't be idle. even before that.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.122
Believe me.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.751
What do you mean?
You scare me.

37:35.629 --> 37:37.422
It means that
I've come to a decision.

37:38.215 --> 37:42.135
It has taken along time, but I
know it's the right choice.

37:42.219 --> 37:44.763
What have you decided?
Tell me, please.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.057
I can't tell you,
it will be too dangerous.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.356
Farewell, my love.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.900
And be careful. Yes?
Mmm-hmm.

37:56.984 --> 37:58.527
Be careful of my brother.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.416
King Harald is in love with you.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.544
I know.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.215
Did he tell you?

39:03.592 --> 39:04.593
Yes.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.929
He has told me that we are
fated to be together.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.681
Mmm.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.101
Do you really believe that?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.689
Who knows our fate? Do you?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.321
He still wants
to be king of Norway.

39:25.572 --> 39:26.615
Ah.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.577
And it seems he puts
the highest value on love...

39:32.078 --> 39:34.539
He is a man who always
wants to be in love.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.252
I would like to have his heart.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.005
Instead of mine.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.299
Why do you say that?

39:45.300 --> 39:46.426
Well, I've had many women.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.721
But I'm not sure
I've ever been in love.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.935
And you are not in love with me?
I don't know.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.772
I think about you all the time.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.166
And then I'm thinking
about something else

40:04.194 --> 40:05.421
and then
I think about you again.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.780
And it happens day and night.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.783
Why are you telling me this?

40:11.117 --> 40:12.702
I don't know,
perhaps I'm in love.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.417
What if you don't love me?

40:20.961 --> 40:22.420
What if you love King Harald?

40:22.504 --> 40:24.130
He can make you
the queen of Norway.

40:25.465 --> 40:26.883
I suppose he could try.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.726
I'm afraid.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.399
I'm afraid to ask you
if you love me.

40:44.401 --> 40:46.611
You are one of the most
famous men in the world.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.114
And you're afraid of me?

40:52.993 --> 40:54.327
I'm alone.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.165
Alone, naked and afraid.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.213
You know something?

41:07.257 --> 41:09.092
I respect you even more
for saying that.

41:12.888 --> 41:17.183
And I will take your words and lock
them away in my heart forever.

41:38.538 --> 41:39.831
Say it.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.086
Say it.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.760
Say it.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.640
Say it.

42:03.313 --> 42:05.732
I love you.

43:40.869 --> 43:42.454
Aud!

44:03.683 --> 44:05.685
No! No!
