WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.242
>> IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM,

00:08.276 --> 00:11.779
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.348
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.382 --> 00:16.184
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.217 --> 00:17.485
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.518 --> 00:19.420
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.055
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.693
>> CUTE TOP, MISTY.
>> THANKS.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.328
>> THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.130
>> IT'S MINE. LET GO!
>> GIVE IT TO ME, SKANK!

00:29.163 --> 00:31.499
>> GET OFF ME, BITCH!
>> YOU'RE DEAD!

00:31.532 --> 00:33.234
>> DOWN, GIRL. AIN'T WORTH
LOSING YOUR JOB OVER.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.302
>> YOU KNOW WHAT,
KEEP THE DAMN THING.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.803
IT'S TRASH LIKE YOU.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.114
[jangling]
OH, YOU WANT SOME MORE, BITCH?

00:50.451 --> 00:53.154
[whimpers]

00:53.187 --> 00:56.490
UH. UH. OOH.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.527
[panting]

01:04.232 --> 01:06.334
WHAT THE--

01:06.367 --> 01:09.537
[hyperventilating]

01:09.570 --> 01:12.640
[screams]

01:12.673 --> 01:14.542
>> HE WAS BEATEN
IN THE CROTCH SO BADLY

01:14.575 --> 01:16.377
HIS SCROTUM RUPTURED.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.645
ALSO HAS DEEP LACERATIONS

01:17.678 --> 01:19.513
TO HIS SHOULDERS
AND LOWER BACK.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.349
AND I FOUND BRUISING
AND SCRATCH MARKS ON HIS PENIS.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.451
>> HE SAY ANYTHING?
>> NO.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.652
WE HAD TO PUT HIM
IN A MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA

01:24.685 --> 01:25.519
TO RELIEVE PRESSURE
ON HIS BRAIN

01:25.553 --> 01:27.488
FROM THE TRAUMA.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.523
IT'S TOUCH AND GO.
>> YOU NOTIFY THE FAMILY?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.558
>> NO, WE WOULD IF WE KNEW
WHO HE WAS.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.825
HIS WALLET WAS CLEANED OUT.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.163
NO I.D. OR CREDIT CARDS.
>> ANY FORENSICS?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.297
OH, I FOUND SALIVA
ON HIS GENITALS.

01:36.330 --> 01:40.268
SWAB'S IN THE RAPE KIT.
AND I DUG THIS OUT OF HIS BACK.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.803
>> FAKE NAIL. CAN YOU TELL US
THE TIME OF THE ATTACK?

01:42.836 --> 01:43.671
>> WELL, THE BRUISING IS FRESH,

01:43.704 --> 01:47.308
SO PROBABLY BETWEEN 9:00
AND 10:00 P.M.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.443
>> HE PICKS UP A STRIPPER
FROM SUGAR POPS,

01:49.477 --> 01:50.811
HE ROUGHS HER UP,
SHE FIGHTS BACK.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.580
I MEAN,
THESE GUYS CAN BE VICIOUS.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.715
>> MAYBE, BUT JOHN DOE LOVES
HIS SON.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.317
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

01:56.350 --> 01:57.551
>> ONLY THING WE FOUND
IN HIS WALLET

01:57.585 --> 01:59.187
WAS THIS PHOTO
TUCKED AWAY.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.856
>> CUTE KID.

02:04.592 --> 02:08.229
"DAD AND HENRY.
AGE FIVE."

02:08.262 --> 02:11.432
>> LET'S HOPE DAD GETS
TO SEE HENRY GROW UP.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.983
>> DAD'S FINGERPRINTS AREN'T
IN THE SYSTEM,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.685
AND THERE'S NO MISSING PERSON
REPORT ON A FATHER

03:04.718 --> 03:06.620
MATCHES THIS DESCRIPTION.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.322
>> SO EITHER NOBODY KNOWS
HE'S MISSING

03:08.356 --> 03:10.624
OR NOBODY CARES,
AND WE CAN'T RELEASE THE PICTURE

03:10.658 --> 03:12.326
TO THE MEDIA
BECAUSE HE'S THE VICTIM

03:12.360 --> 03:14.328
OF A SEX CRIME.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.797
FORENSICS ANY HELP?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.799
>> WELL, WARNER RAN THE SALIVA
ON THE GUY'S JUNK.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.368
DNA WASN'T IN THE SYSTEM,

03:20.401 --> 03:22.603
BUT THE PERP IS DEFINITELY
FEMALE.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.671
>> WITH CHEAP TASTE
IN FAKE NAILS.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.739
THERE'S NO WAY
TO TRACE IT.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.941
>> AND THE RAIN LAST NIGHT
KILLED ANY TRACE OF IT

03:27.975 --> 03:29.410
IN THE PARKING LOT.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.411
>> WITHOUT A BLOOD TRAIL,
IT'S HARD TO TELL

03:30.444 --> 03:31.879
WHERE HE WAS ATTACKED
OR WHERE HE CAME FROM.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.414
>> WELL, I'M NO EXPERT,

03:33.447 --> 03:35.883
BUT FOR ME, FELLATIO
PLUS FAKE FINGER NAIL

03:35.916 --> 03:38.252
EQUALS EXOTIC DANCER.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.621
FIN, TAKE MUNCH.
GO BACK TO SUGAR POPS.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.723
AND SEE IF THE LADIES
REVEAL ANYTHING.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.696
>> I TOLD THE COPS LAST NIGHT
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.866
BUT I GUESS YOU WANTED
TO COME SEE FOR YOURSELF, HMM?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.768
>> IT'S KINDA HARD NOT TO.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.704
CAN I SEE YOUR FINGERNAILS?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.840
>> OH, BALLET SLIPPER
WITH A TOP COAT OF MARSHMALLOW.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.976
YOU COPS SURE HAVE
AN EYE FOR DETAIL.

04:03.010 --> 04:07.581
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER?

04:07.615 --> 04:08.716
>> YEAH.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.718
SOMEBODY GIVIN' THIS GUY
A PRIVATE DANCE?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.287
>> I'M STRICTLY VIP PARTIES.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.424
BUT THAT ONE,
SHE IS DESPERATE

04:16.457 --> 04:18.659
AND WILL DANCE
FOR ANY NASTY OLD THING.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.727
>> I DIDN'T SEE HIM HERE.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.795
BUT I HAD MY HANDS FULL
WITH A BUNCH OF FRAT BOYS.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.531
HAD TO BEAT 'EM OFF
WITH A STICK.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.833
>> BREAK A NAIL
BEATING ANYBODY ELSE OFF?

04:25.866 --> 04:28.736
>> THESE ARE FOR PLEASURE,
NOT PAIN.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.005
>> LOOKS LIKE IT HURT.
DID YOU CUT YOURSELF SHAVING?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.074
>> THAT OLD TRAMP SAPPHIRE
JUMPED ME.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.644
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOUNG GUYS FIND ME HOT.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.312
>> DID ANYBODY ELSE GET
INTO IT LAST NIGHT?

04:38.346 --> 04:40.681
>> FRANKIE THE BOUNCER BEAT UP
A GUY IN THE PARKING LOT.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.517
>> THE ASSAILANT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A FEMALE.

04:43.551 --> 04:48.789
>> OH, FRANKIE'S A WOMAN.
AND A BIG OLD MEAN ONE.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.823
>> YEAH, I HAD TO GET TOUGH
WITH A GUY LAST NIGHT.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.859
HE'S A FREAKIN' PERV.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.094
>> YOU SENT THIS FREAKIN' PERV
TO THE HOSPITAL?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.963
>> NEVER SEEN HIM.

04:55.996 --> 04:59.900
TALKIN 'BOUT, YES,
PSYCHO SID.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.569
>> SUGAR POP'S
TEN LEAST WANTED LIST, HUH?

05:01.602 --> 05:04.772
>> YEAH, MEN.
CAN'T LIVE WITH 'EM.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.707
SURE CAN LIVE WITHOUT 'EM.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.743
>> PSYCHO SID WAS HERE
LAST NIGHT?

05:09.777 --> 05:10.911
>> GUY KNOWS
HE'S NOT WELCOME.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.746
HE JUST KEEPS COMING BACK.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.450
HE'S, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
OBSESSED WITH THE STRIPPERS.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.552
CAUGHT HIM IN THE PARKING LOT
HIDING BEHIND CARS,

05:18.586 --> 05:19.553
WAITING FOR THE GIRLS
TO LEAVE.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.921
>> WHAT TIME WAS HE OUT HERE?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.056
>> 8:00 ON.
KEPT COMING BACK TOO.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.927
EVEN AFTER I SHOWED HIM
THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.762
>> I DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.365
>> WE KNOW. YOU JUST LIKE
TO WATCH THE DANCERS.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.602
>> BUT FRANKIE DON'T ALLOW IT.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.103
ARE YOU A DANCER?

05:36.136 --> 05:40.641
>> NO, SID, REMEMBER?
REMEMBER?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.543
I'M A DETECTIVE.
>> OH, YEAH.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.778
YOU'RE PRETTY ENOUGH
TO BE A DANCER.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.880
>> THANK YOU, SID.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.117
>> YOU'RE NOT.
>> IT'S A CROSS I BEAR.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.786
UH, SID, WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE PARKING LOT LAST NIGHT,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.054
DID YOU SEE ANY DANCERS
OUTSIDE?

05:54.087 --> 05:57.024
>> JUST ONE.
>> YEAH? WHO?

05:57.057 --> 06:00.694
>> I COULDN'T SEE HER FACE.
SHE WAS FIGHTING WITH A MAN.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.895
>> THIS MAN?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.931
>> MM-HMM.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.166
HE HAD A TOW TRUCK
WITH PRETTY RED LIGHTS.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.136
>> DID HE TOW HER CAR?
>> MM-MM.

06:09.169 --> 06:14.074
SHE GOT IN THE TRUCK,
AND THEY DROVE BEHIND THE CLUB.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.678
I KNOW WHY PEOPLE GO
BEHIND THE CLUB.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.846
>> OH, YOU DO?
>> YEAH.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.848
OH, I LIKE TO WATCH.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.783
>> DID YOU SEE
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.118
>> NO. I PRETENDED
I WAS WITH THE PRETTY GIRL.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.587
OH, IT FELT GOOD.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.188
>> WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THEY WERE DONE?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.858
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS DONE.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.860
SO I LEFT.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.996
>> SID, JUST STAY AWAY FROM
THE DANCERS FROM NOW ON, OKAY?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.698
>> SO OUR VICTIM'S
A REPO MAN.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.866
OUR GIRL MUST BE LATE
ON HER CAR PAYMENTS.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.867
>> AND HE TOOK IT OUT
IN TRADE.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.969
WELL, WE KNOW OUR JOHN DOE LEFT
IN AN AMBULANCE,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.004
SO HIS TOW TRUCK'S GOTTA BE
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CLUB.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.976
>> FIND ANYTHING THAT TELLS US
WHO THE DRIVER WAS?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.011
>> ALL I KNOW IS
HE'S A SLOB.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.846
I THINK I JUST FOUND
LAST WEEK'S LUNCH.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.116
>> FIND ANY USABLE PRINTS?
>> ABOUT 20 DIFFERENT SETS.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.652
TAKE A WHILE TO SORT 'EM
ALL OUT.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.188
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.856
>> TIRE IRON.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.758
>> THERE'S BLOOD ON THE TIP.

07:04.792 --> 07:05.859
>> AND HAIR.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.661
IT'S GOTTA BE
OUR ASSAULT WEAPON.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.663
THESE SMUDGES ON THE HANDLE
MIGHT BE PARTIAL PRINTS.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.832
STILL DOESN'T GIVE US
AN I.D. ON YOUR VICTIM.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.902
>> WELL, THIS WILL.

07:14.935 --> 07:15.903
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.839
>> REPO BUSTERS.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.774
>> HIS NAME'S MARK VAN KUREN.
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.876
AND USUALLY SO CAREFUL
ON THE JOB.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.211
>> WEREN'T YOU WORRIED
WHEN HE DIDN'T SHOW UP

07:24.244 --> 07:25.879
TO WORK THIS MORNING,
MS.--?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.147
>> PETERS. SELMA PETERS.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.783
MARK DOESN'T START
TILL AFTER 10:00 P.M.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.685
WHEN FOLKS ARE IN BED.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.922
HE WISED UP
AFTER HE TRIED TO TAKE A MINIVAN

07:34.955 --> 07:37.791
FROM A HOCKEY MOM AND SHE BEAT
HIM WITH HER SON'S STICK.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.960
>> WELL, WE BELIEVE VAN KUREN
WAS ATTACKED

07:39.993 --> 07:41.128
BY A WOMAN LAST NIGHT.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.063
HE WAS TOWING HER CAR AWAY

07:43.096 --> 07:44.932
FROM A STRIP CLUB CALLED
SUGAR POPS.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.967
>> A REPO
FROM A NUDIE JOINT?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.536
OH, I'D REMEMBER THAT.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.003
MY GUYS WOULD HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING OVER IT.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.840
>> DID ANY OF MARK'S JOBS
YESTERDAY HAVE A FEMALE OWNER?

07:52.873 --> 07:55.042
>> LET ME CHECK.

07:55.075 --> 07:59.647
UH, HE WAS AFTER AN INVESTMENT
BANKER WITH A BOAT.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.982
GOT LAID OFF FROM LEHMAN.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.251
OH, YEAH, THE TOYOTA.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.986
THIS GAL'S BEEN DODGING HIM
FOR WEEKS.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.054
>> WHAT'S THE OWNER'S NAME?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.623
>> MOLLY LAMBERT.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.991
LIVES ON PARK AVENUE,

08:11.024 --> 08:13.861
BUT CAN'T MAKE THE PAYMENT
ON AN '07 COROLLA?

08:16.897 --> 08:18.632
>> MOLLY HASN'T LIVED HERE
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

08:18.666 --> 08:22.703
SHE'S GETTING HER PhD
AT HUDSON UNIVERSITY.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.606
IS MY DAUGHTER
IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.641
>> HER CAR WAS DAMAGED
IN A TRAFFIC INCIDENT.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.043
A DRUNK DRIVER SIDESWIPED
A GROUP OF PARKED CARS.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.211
>> I BETTER CALL
MY ATTORNEY.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.314
>> I TOLD HER NOT TO PARK
HER MERCEDES ON THE STREET.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.315
>> ACTUALLY,
THIS WAS A TOYOTA.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.085
>> A TOYOTA?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.320
>> MOLLY WOULD NEVER DRIVE
ONE OF THOSE.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.990
YOU MUST HAVE
THE WRONG PERSON.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.626
>> THE CAR IS REGISTERED
TO MOLLY AT THIS ADDRESS.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.728
>> SOMEONE MUST HAVE STOLEN
HER IDENTITY.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.730
>> YOU COULD JUST GIVE US
MOLLY'S ADDRESS,

08:49.763 --> 08:51.264
AND WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.335
[footsteps]

08:55.368 --> 08:57.237
>> HI, MOLLY.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.640
OR DO YOU PREFER MISTY?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.109
>> [sighs]

09:02.142 --> 09:04.845
SO I GUESS YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR A LAP DANCE?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.320
>> RICH GIRL BY DAY,
STRIPPER BY NIGHT.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.322
>> DANCING'S NOT A CRIME.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.157
>> ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON IS.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.127
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> MARK VAN KUREN.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.029
NOW DO YOUR SERVICES INCLUDE
HEAD BASHING?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.865
>> I DIDN'T TOUCH HIM.
>> REALLY?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.166
>> WELL, LET'S SEE
IF HER DNA MATCHES

09:26.199 --> 09:28.101
THE SALIVA WE FOUND
ON HIS PENIS.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.637
>> OKAY, SO I DID HIM,
BUT THAT'S IT.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.570
>> YOU CLAWED HIM PRETTY GOOD.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.072
WE TOOK ONE OF YOUR NAILS
OUT OF HIS BACK.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.075
>> WELL, HE TOLD ME
TO SCRATCH HIM.

09:35.108 --> 09:35.943
SAID HE LIKED IT ROUGH.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.212
>> I DOUBT HE TOLD YOU
TO BITE IT OFF.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.714
>> THAT'S NOT HOW I WORK.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.984
LAST TIME I SAW HIM,
DUDE WAS ALL SMILES.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.152
>> YOUR RICH PARENTS GONNA BE
ALL SMILES

09:45.185 --> 09:46.920
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DO FOR KICKS?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.860
>> I'M AN ETHNOGRAPHER.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.828
A CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGIST.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.963
I LIVE THE LIFE
OF THE PEOPLE I'M STUDYING.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.365
>> SO YOU STUDY STRIPPERS
IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT?

09:58.398 --> 10:01.268
>> RESEARCH FOR MY BOOK,
PLAY MISTY FOR YOU.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.671
IT STARTED
AS MY DOCTORAL DISSERTATION.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.773
MY AGENT THINKS
IT'LL BE A BESTSELLER.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.307
>> DOES HE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A TRUST FUND BABY?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.376
>> I GAVE ALL THAT UP
FOR MISTY.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.044
I LIVE ON HER SALARY,

10:11.078 --> 10:14.081
RENT THAT DUMP OF AN APARTMENT,
DRIVE A CHEAP CAR.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.183
I MAKE SACRIFICES
FOR MY RESEARCH.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.686
>> YOU CALL SHAKING YOUR TA-TAS
FOR DIRTY OLD MEN RESEARCH?

10:18.719 --> 10:21.689
>> I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THIS.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.993
>> WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR SHIRT?
>> NOTHING.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.763
>> UNBUTTON IT, OR I WILL.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.300
>> I USUALLY GET PAID
FOR THIS.

10:33.333 --> 10:37.170
>> OH.
DIGITAL RECORDER.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.106
YOUR DEEP THROAT INTERVIEW
WITH MARK ON HERE?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.874
>> NO, IT'S ON A FLASH DRIVE.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.142
>> HAND IT OVER.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.214
>> EACH ONE OF THESE HOLDS
A WEEK'S WORTH OF RESEARCH.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.348
IT'S MY ONLY COPY.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.950
>> IT'S EVIDENCE
IN AN INVESTIGATION.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.084
>> DO I GET IT BACK?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.019
>> I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.687
MISTY DISAPPEARS,
OR MOLLY GOES TO JAIL

10:53.721 --> 10:55.723
FOR PROSTITUTION.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.992
NOW SHAKE IT ON OUT OF HERE.

11:02.930 --> 11:06.066
[heavy breathing]
>> HARDER, HARDER.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.936
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.238
USE YOUR NAILS.
USE YOUR NAILS.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.807
MAKE ME BLEED.
>> YOU LIKE THAT?

11:13.841 --> 11:14.875
YOU WANT MORE?

11:14.908 --> 11:15.876
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE MOLLY
REALLY GOT INTO THE PART.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.411
>> LOTTA PARTS.
>> IT ALSO SOUNDS CONSENSUAL.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.147
>> WELL, IT DOESN'T PROVE

11:20.180 --> 11:22.115
SHE DIDN'T ATTACK HIM
AFTERWARDS.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.051
WHAT ELSE WE HAVE
ON THIS TAPE?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.252
>> HEY, MISTY,
WHERE YOU BEEN?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.219
BOSS IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.822
>> I WENT TO MY CAR
FOR A SECOND, FRANKIE.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.723
>> IT'S PAYDAY.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.792
GONNA SAVE A DANCE FOR ME,
SWEET THING?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.927
>> WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE MISTY
THE ANTHROPOLOGIST

11:33.961 --> 11:36.229
DIDN'T HANG AROUND
AFTER SHE FINISHED EXCAVATING.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.298
>> HE GOT OFF,
SHE GOT OFF, IT WAS A DONE DEAL.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.000
>> SHE GOES BACK INSIDE,
RIDES THE POLE.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.802
SHE'S GOT AN ALIBI
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.271
>> SO WHOEVER ATTACKED VAN KUREN
HAD TO SHOW UP

11:44.304 --> 11:45.973
AFTER MISTY FINISHED
HER RESEARCH.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.776
>> AH, WELL,
MAYBE VAN KUREN CAN TELL US WHO.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.344
THAT WAS THE HOSPITAL.
HE JUST WOKE UP.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.983
>> I HAD SEX WITH A STRIPPER
IN A PARKING LOT.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.451
I THINK I WOULD REMEMBER THAT.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.755
>> SO WHAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU DO REMEMBER?

12:01.789 --> 12:04.524
>> STOPPING FOR COFFEE
ON MY WAY TO WORK.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.194
>> WHO WOULD WANT
TO HURT YOU, MARK?

12:09.029 --> 12:12.032
>> ONLY ONE PERSON HATES ME
THIS MUCH.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.166
MY SOON-TO-BE EX-WIFE.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.003
>> MESSY DIVORCE?

12:16.036 --> 12:21.274
>> ELLEN IS--SHE'S FURIOUS
'CAUSE I'M FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.243
>> WELL, WE FOUND THIS
IN YOUR WALLET.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.178
THIS YOUR ONLY CHILD?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.880
>> YEAH, HE'S 13 NOW.

12:26.914 --> 12:32.119
I LOVE THIS KID
MORE THAN LIFE.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.954
SO DOES ELLEN.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.057
>> SO YOU THINK
THIS IS ABOUT CUSTODY?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.793
>> SHE SAID
THAT SHE WOULD KILL ME

12:39.827 --> 12:43.030
BEFORE SHE WOULD LET ME TAKE
MY SON AWAY FROM HER.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.232
>> PEOPLE SAY THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE SEPARATING.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.334
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
I STILL LOVE MARK.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.337
>> SO WHY THE SPLIT?
>> IT'S COMPLICATED.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.940
WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS
ABOUT HOW TO RAISE OUR CHILD.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.809
>> HENRY'S A HANDFUL?
>> IT'S HAILEY.

12:58.879 --> 12:59.913
MY NAME'S HAILEY.

13:01.348 --> 13:05.352
HENRY'S DEAD.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.389
>> MY SON IS TRANSGENDER.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.059
WHEN HE WAS FOUR, HE PARADED
INTO THE LIVING ROOM

13:12.092 --> 13:14.261
IN HIS COUSIN'S TUTU
AND ANNOUNCED HE WAS A GIRL.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.263
>> A LOT OF BOYS GO
THROUGH DRESS-UP PHASES.

13:16.296 --> 13:20.934
MY OLDEST SON WORE
HIS MOM'S HIGH HEELS.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.270
>> DID YOUR SON TRY TO CUT OFF
HIS PENIS WITH NAIL CLIPPERS

13:23.303 --> 13:25.372
AND SCREAM,
"GOD MADE A MISTAKE"?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.342
IT'S NOT A PHASE,
DETECTIVE.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.343
HAILEY WAS BORN
IN THE WRONG BODY,

13:30.377 --> 13:31.478
AND I'VE ACCEPTED THAT.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
>> BUT YOUR HUSBAND CAN'T.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.283
>> MARK PRETENDS
HAILEY DOESN'T EXIST.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.885
HE DRAGGED HER TO A SHRINK
WHO TOLD HER

13:37.918 --> 13:41.288
THAT SHE'D GROW OUT OF IT
IF SHE DRESSED LIKE A BOY

13:41.321 --> 13:42.155
AND PLAYED WITH TRUCKS.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.257
>> BUT IT DIDN'T CHANGE
HAILEY'S MIND.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.395
>> IT MADE HER SUICIDAL.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.930
WHEN SHE WAS 10,
SHE DRANK BLEACH,

13:49.963 --> 13:51.865
AND SHE ALMOST DIED.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.266
I REALIZED
IF WE DIDN'T LET HER BE HERSELF,

13:53.300 --> 13:55.402
WE WERE GONNA LOSE HER.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.171
>> SO NOW HENRY DRESSES UP
IN GIRLS' CLOTHING.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.639
>> THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO IT.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.274
SHE'S GOING THROUGH PUBERTY.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.011
AND HER THERAPIST SAYS
THAT SHE NEEDS TO BEGIN

14:04.044 --> 14:06.046
HORMONE BLOCKERS TO STOP IT,

14:06.079 --> 14:09.016
OR THE REASSIGNMENT SURGERY...
WILL BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.451
>> BUT MARK WON'T ALLOW IT.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.353
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.955
>> YEAH, EVERY DAY'S A FIGHT.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.091
>> FIGHTS EVER GET PHYSICAL?
>> NO.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.294
YOU THINK I HURT MARK?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.163
>> WHERE WERE YOU
TWO NIGHTS AGO?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.199
>> AT WORK.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.001
I'M A WAITRESS.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.469
TEN PEOPLE CAN TELL YOU
I WAS THERE.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.104
>> WHERE'D YOU GET
THE BLACK EYE?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.408
>> HAILEY HIT ME.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.911
MONDAY NIGHT,
SHE WAS CLIMBING IN THE WINDOW

14:37.945 --> 14:39.412
AT 2:00 A.M.,
AND I ASKED HER WHERE SHE WAS.

14:39.446 --> 14:43.250
AND WE GOT INTO IT,
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE PUNCHED ME.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.419
>> MONDAY NIGHT WAS
WHEN MARK WAS ATTACKED.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.088
>> OH.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.389
OH, GOD.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.091
>> DID YOU ASK HER
WHERE SHE'D BEEN?

14:54.027 --> 14:57.931
>> SHE SAID SHE WAS STRIKING
A BLOW FOR HER FREEDOM.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.000
[knocks]
>> GO AWAY!

15:00.033 --> 15:02.602
>> HAILEY.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.571
>> DON'T YOU READ?
KEEP THE HELL OUT.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.473
>> HAILEY, THESE DETECTIVES

15:06.506 --> 15:08.275
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.609
>> I'M TRYING
TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.944
>> IT'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.413
YOU WERE OUT LATE MONDAY NIGHT.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.282
>> YOU CALL THE COPS ON ME
BECAUSE I BROKE CURFEW?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.283
SO LAME.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.652
>> WHERE WERE YOU?
>> NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
>> HAILEY, ANSWER HIS QUESTION.
>> OR WHAT?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.957
YOU'LL GROUND ME
FOR ANOTHER MONTH?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.159
>> YOUR FATHER WAS ATTACKED
THAT NIGHT.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.263
>> IS HE DEAD?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.565
>> NO, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.268
>> TOO BAD.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.403
>> HAILEY, IT'S
A REALLY TERRIBLE THING TO SAY.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.171
THAT'S YOUR FATHER.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.107
>> WISH HE WASN'T.
WISH HE WERE DEAD.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.242
>> SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT.
>> WANNA BET?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.743
WHOEVER ATTACKED HIM,
IT WASN'T ME.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.978
>> SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
>> JUST OUT, OKAY?

15:46.479 --> 15:47.547
>> WERE YOU WITH ANYONE?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.549
>> A BOY.

15:49.582 --> 15:54.521
>> A BOY?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.356
HAILEY, ARE YOU GAY?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.591
>> YOU STILL DON'T GET IT,
MOM.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.093
I'M A GIRL.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.129
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH BOYS.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.368
>> SOUNDS LIKE
A TYPICAL TEENAGE GIRL.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.303
>> EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS BORN
A BOY.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.439
>> HAILEY'S ANATOMY
IS IRRELEVANT.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.706
HER BRAIN IS FEMALE.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.275
SHE WANTS WHAT A GIRL WANTS.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.776
>> WELL, WHAT CAUSES
THE MIX-UP?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.278
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.047
FOR SOME CHILDREN,
SOMETHING HAPPENS IN UTERO

16:20.080 --> 16:21.648
WHERE THE BRAIN DEVELOPS
AS ONE GENDER

16:21.681 --> 16:23.050
AND THE BODY THE OTHER.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.784
>> SO SHE FEELS TRAPPED.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.519
BORN AS THE WRONG GENDER,
TRYING DESPERATELY

16:26.553 --> 16:28.021
TO BECOME THE RIGHT ONE.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.157
>> AND THE ONLY ONE STANDING
IN THE WAY IS DAD.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.525
>> SOUNDS LIKE MOTIVE TO ME.
DOC?

16:32.559 --> 16:34.394
>> I GOTTA SAY, MARK BEING
BEATEN IN THE CROTCH

16:34.427 --> 16:35.595
IS PRETTY SYMBOLIC.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.264
>> SHE ALSO GAVE HER MOM
A BLACK EYE.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.399
IT'S NOT SUCH A LEAP
TO ATTACKING HER DAD.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.335
>> WELL, I'LL FEEL BETTER
ONCE WE RUN DOWN HAILEY'S ALIBI.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.137
HEAD OVER TO THE SCHOOL,
GET THE NAME OF THE BOY

16:44.171 --> 16:45.305
SHE SNUCK OUT TO SEE.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.207
>> AND CHECK
WITH THE GUIDANCE STAFF.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.643
HOME MAY NOT BE THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE HAILEY LOSES CONTROL.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.348
>> HAILEY'S BEEN HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME THIS YEAR.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.483
>> BECAUSE SHE'S TRANSGENDER.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.518
>> WELL, SHE CAME OUT
IN SEPTEMBER

16:58.551 --> 17:00.520
AND STARTED WEARING
GIRLS' CLOTHES.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.622
A LOT OF HER OLD FRIENDS
DON'T TALK TO HER ANYMORE.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.657
>> AND HOW'D SHE HANDLE THAT?
ANY ACTING OUT?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.726
>> WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME PROBLEMS.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.596
TWO MONTHS AGO,
HAILEY WENT INTO THE BATHROOM.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.164
SOME OLDER GIRLS WERE
IN THERE,

17:11.198 --> 17:13.500
AND ONE OF THEM SAID
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW HE-SHEs.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.202
HAILEY DRAGGED HER
INTO THE STALL

17:15.235 --> 17:16.703
AND PUSHED HER HEAD
INTO THE TOILET.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.638
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
THAT'S BATTERY.

17:18.671 --> 17:22.842
>> WELL, WE SUSPENDED HER
FOR THREE DAYS.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.077
NOW HAILEY USES
THE GENDER-NEUTRAL BATHROOM

17:24.111 --> 17:25.478
IN THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.514
SHE DOESN'T TAKE PHYS ED,
SO SHE WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE

17:27.547 --> 17:28.515
IN A LOCKER ROOM.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.418
>> ANY OTHER VIOLENCE?

17:31.451 --> 17:32.419
>> HAILEY GOT INTO A SCUFFLE
WITH A LITTLE BOY

17:32.452 --> 17:34.154
WHO CALLED HER A FAGGOT.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.855
HAILEY GAVE HIM
A BLACK EYE.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.491
AND A NEW TEACHER CALLED HER
HENRY BY MISTAKE.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.459
HAILEY THREW A BOOK AT HIM.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.262
>> ALL THAT,
AND SHE HASN'T BEEN EXPELLED?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.397
>> THERE'S BEEN TALKS,
BUT I'VE TOLD THE SCHOOL.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.798
IT'S A PROCESS.
A LEARNING PROCESS.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.134
FOR ALL OF US.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.169
>> WHERE'S HAILEY NOW?
>> IN MY OFFICE.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.604
ELLEN CALLED TO TELL ME
ABOUT MARK'S ATTACK.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.606
I BROUGHT HER IN
TO TALK TO HER.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.113
>> HI, HAILEY.
>> NOT AGAIN.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.248
CAN'T YOU PEOPLE
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

18:01.281 --> 18:02.882
>> WE HAVE
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.417
>> WE NEED
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S NAME.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.418
>> SO YOU CAN TELL
MY MOM?

18:05.452 --> 18:06.586
>> WE CAN KEEP IT
BETWEEN US.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.787
>> LIKE I'M STUPID ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE THAT.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.358
>> HAILEY, YOU NEED TO ANSWER
THE DETECTIVES' QUESTIONS.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.659
>> WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.561
>> YOURS,
BUT THIS IS SERIOUS.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.630
>> IT'S NOT FAIR.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.532
>> HAILEY, WE CAN FIND OUT
WHERE YOU WERE.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.501
WE CAN CHECK YOUR E-MAIL,
CHECK YOUR CELL PHONE RECORDS.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.537
>> NO, DON'T DO THAT.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.482
I DID IT.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.619
>> HAILEY,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:39.652 --> 18:40.653
>> I DID IT.

18:40.687 --> 18:44.391
I TRIED TO KILL MY DAD.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.898
>> NICE WORK GETTING
HAILEY VAN KUREN TO CONFESS

18:51.931 --> 18:53.466
TO ATTACKING HER DAD.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.734
>> GOT A LITTLE WRINKLE.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.603
SHE'S A MINOR,
AND HER MOM WASN'T THERE.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.238
>> WHICH MEANS
IT'S INADMISSIBLE.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.307
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
>> SHE JUST BLURTED IT OUT.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.242
WE WEREN'T EVEN SWEATING HER
AS A SUSPECT.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.645
>> SO YOU WEREN'T EVEN TRAWLING
AND THE FISH JUMPS IN THE BOAT.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.580
WELL, HOW DO WE JUSTIFY
NOT THROWING IT BACK?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.449
>> WELL, HER MOM'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.750
WE'LL GET HER TO WAIVE MIRANDA,

19:10.783 --> 19:12.352
REINTERVIEW HAILEY
IN HER PRESENCE,

19:12.385 --> 19:13.620
AND GET A CONFESSION AGAIN.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.587
>> WELL, IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.889
YOU ROLL SNAKE EYES,
MOM LAWYERS UP HAILEY,

19:16.923 --> 19:18.225
AND WE CRAP OUT.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.493
>> DETECTIVE?

19:20.527 --> 19:22.962
>> ROLL THE DICE.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.897
>> OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY IS HAILEY HERE?

19:24.931 --> 19:26.733
>> SHE SAID THAT SHE IS THE
PERSON THAT ATTACKED HER FATHER.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.600
>> OH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.202
>> WELL, YOU NEED
TO HEAR HER TELL--

19:29.236 --> 19:30.770
>> UH, SHE'S NOT SAYING
ANOTHER WORD, OKAY?

19:30.803 --> 19:34.441
I'M GONNA CALL MY LAWYER.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.543
>> THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH
A SHOT.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.445
>> IS THERE A PLAN B?

19:38.478 --> 19:39.712
>> UH, YEAH, FIN'S GETTING
A WARRANT.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.314
HAILEY DIDN'T DITCH
THE WEAPON,

19:41.348 --> 19:43.816
SO, HOPEFULLY, SHE DIDN'T DUMP
THE BLOODY CLOTHES.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.823
>> LOOKS LIKE HENRY'S OLD TOYS.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.260
>> SAME KIND OF STUFF
MY SON HAD GROWING UP.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.629
>> I GUESS SHE STILL LIKES
COMIC BOOKS.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.764
IT'S A BUNCH OF DRUGS.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.233
ESTROGEN, TESTOSTERONE...

20:04.504 --> 20:06.773
>> WHAT THE HELL IS LEUPROLIDE?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.375
>> IT'S THE HORMONE BLOCKER
DOCTORS PRESCRIBE

20:08.408 --> 20:10.577
TO TRANSSEXUAL KIDS
TO STOP PUBERTY.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.878
>> SO HAILEY'S BUYING HORMONES
ON THE STREET

20:11.911 --> 20:13.546
TO BEGIN TRANSITIONING
ON HER OWN.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.948
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
SHE'S A TRANS GIRL.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.418
SHE'LL TAKE ESTROGEN TO GROW
BREASTS WHEN SHE'S OLDER,

20:18.451 --> 20:20.720
BUT SHE WOULD NEVER TAKE
TESTOSTERONE.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.355
>> WELL, SHE'S GOT
A LIFETIME SUPPLY HERE.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.357
>> WORTH A COUPLE HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS

20:24.391 --> 20:26.626
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.496
SO I DID SOME CHECKING
ON THE LEDGER WEB SITE.

20:29.529 --> 20:34.467
>> "PHARMA FILCHERS
STRIKE AGAIN."

20:34.501 --> 20:35.702
>> SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL
WAREHOUSES WERE BROKEN INTO

20:35.735 --> 20:36.769
RECENTLY.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.672
THE THIEVES ONLY STOLE DRUGS
USED TO TRANSITION.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.841
>> OH, HO, HO, SANTY CAME EARLY
THIS YEAR.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.810
>> WHAT'S THIS?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.745
>> HORMONES THAT WE FOUND
STASHED IN HAILEY'S CLOSET.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.747
>> HAILEY.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.316
WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.050
>> DON'T SAY A WORD.
>> OKAY, THEN I WILL.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.752
TAUSCHER-LETO PHARMACEUTICALS.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.621
THEIR WAREHOUSE WAS ROBBED,

20:54.654 --> 20:56.022
ALONG WITH THREE OTHER
COMPANIES.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.324
>> MY CLIENT IS 13.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.525
I HARDLY THINK
SHE'S EVEN CAPABLE

20:58.558 --> 20:59.626
OF COMMITTING THESE CRIMES.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.727
>> NOT BY HERSELF.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.795
THE THEFTS WERE
A GROUP EFFORT.

21:02.829 --> 21:06.433
A ROBBERY SQUAD
FOUND THIS MANIFESTO

21:06.466 --> 21:08.601
AT ONE OF THE CRIME SCENES.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.603
"WE WILL NOT PAY

21:10.637 --> 21:13.306
"FOR THE RIGHT
TO BECOME WHO WE ALREADY ARE.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.908
"WE WILL LIBERATE OUR BODIES
FROM GREEDY CORPORATIONS

21:15.942 --> 21:19.812
SEEKING TO PROFIT
FROM OUR PAIN."

21:19.846 --> 21:21.414
SIGNED "THE CHILDREN OF ARIEL."

21:21.448 --> 21:22.915
>> OH, GOD.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.684
ARE THESE THE PEOPLE
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.653
SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS GOING TO A SUPPORT GROUP

21:26.686 --> 21:28.555
FOR TRANS KIDS.
>> MOM, DON'T!

21:28.588 --> 21:29.789
>> WHERE DO YOU MEET?
CHILDREN OF ARIEL?

21:29.822 --> 21:30.890
>> I'LL NEVER TELL.

21:30.923 --> 21:31.891
>> YOU CAN'T PROTECT 'EM.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.361
I DROPPED HER OFF ONCE
AT A CHURCH IN CHELSEA.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.399
>> WE MEET AGAIN ON FRIDAY.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.868
HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE.
HEY.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.470
>> MM-HMM.
>> OUR MEETINGS ARE PRIVATE.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.872
>> NO, I'M A CHILD
OF ARIEL'S.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.075
PLANNING OUR NEXT BIG HEIST?

21:49.108 --> 21:50.377
>> I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.310
>> SHORT MEMORY?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.112
TWO NIGHTS AGO,
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS BROKE

21:53.145 --> 21:55.882
INTO A PHARMACEUTICAL
WAREHOUSE.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.350
>> I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.885
>> WE FOUND YOUR STASH

21:58.918 --> 22:01.921
FROM THE TAUSCHER-LETO JOB
IN HAILEY VAN KUREN'S BEDROOM.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.491
>> IS SHE OKAY?
>> YOU SOUND CONCERNED.

22:04.524 --> 22:08.361
>> YEAH, HAILEY'S MY FRIEND.
>> IS THAT ALL SHE IS?

22:08.395 --> 22:10.397
>> I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH HER.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.531
SHE'S A LITTLE KID.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.732
>> IN GROWN-UP TROUBLE.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.601
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.835
>> I MEAN, YOU ARE
A PIECE OF WORK.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.471
YOU'RE GONNA LET A 13-YEAR-OLD
GIRL TAKE THE FALL FOR YOU?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.473
COME ON. BE A MAN.
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY ARE.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.875
>> YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME.

22:22.909 --> 22:23.976
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT HOW IT FEELS

22:24.010 --> 22:25.678
TO HAVE YOUR BODY BETRAY YOU.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.815
THOSE DRUGS ARE A LIFELINE.

22:28.848 --> 22:29.782
>> SO YOU STEAL THE DRUGS

22:29.816 --> 22:31.651
FROM THE RICH PHARMACEUTICAL
MANUFACTURERS

22:31.684 --> 22:32.952
AND YOU GIVE
TO THE POOR TRANSSEXUALS.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.722
YOU'RE KINDA LIKE ROBIN HOOD
AND MAID MARION

22:35.755 --> 22:36.889
ALL WRAPPED INTO ONE,
HUH?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.591
>> YOU'RE NO BETTER
THAN A DRUG DEALER

22:38.625 --> 22:39.726
THAT MAKES A KID HOLD
HIS STASH

22:39.759 --> 22:40.727
'CAUSE THEY'LL ONLY GET
JUVE TIME.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.796
>> WELL, HAILEY'LL BE GETTING
ADULT JAIL TIME

22:43.830 --> 22:45.064
BECAUSE SHE'S GOING AWAY
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.567
>> WHAT?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.502
>> YEAH, SHE BASHED HER FATHER'S
HEAD IN MONDAY NIGHT.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.871
>> SHE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.574
>> AND HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WAS SHE WITH YOU?

22:54.607 --> 22:57.544
BLAKE, HAILEY GOES
TO JAIL,

22:57.577 --> 22:59.011
SHE DOESN'T GET
THE HORMONES.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.913
SHE BECOMES A MAN.

23:00.947 --> 23:01.948
SO.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.085
>> HAILEY WAS WITH US

23:06.118 --> 23:07.820
AT THE TAUSCHER-LETO WAREHOUSE
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.022
SHE JUST SHOWED UP.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.157
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO HELP,

23:11.190 --> 23:13.760
AND I DIDN'T LET HER
RAID THE PLACE.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.027
I TOLD HER TO GO WAIT
IN THE VAN.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.996
>> BUT YOU LET HER STASH
THE DRUGS.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.197
>> YEAH, BUT ONLY
UNTIL IT WAS SAFE TO MOVE 'EM.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.568
>> WHAT TIME WAS SHE WITH YOU?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.035
>> 8:00 TILL 1:00 A.M.

23:23.069 --> 23:23.870
>> OKAY.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.206
HAILEY DID NOT ATTACK
HER FATHER.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.041
SHE WAS AT THE RAID
ON TAUSCHER-LETO.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.978
BLAKE TOLD US.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.079
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.681
WHY DID YOU SAY
YOU HURT YOUR FATHER?

23:34.714 --> 23:37.917
>> I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHERE I REALLY WAS.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.051
BLAKE WOULD GET
IN TROUBLE.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.623
>> YOU WERE GONNA GO
TO JAIL FOR HIM.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.860
>> I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR BLAKE.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.762
>> ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.930
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO COME BACK

23:50.963 --> 23:52.599
AND ANSWER QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE ROBBERY.

23:52.632 --> 23:56.202
>> THANK YOU.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.170
>> BLAKE!

23:58.204 --> 24:00.540
>> I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.041
>> HAILEY, LISTEN,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

24:02.074 --> 24:06.112
OKAY? I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET
YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.614
>> BUT I WANTED TO DO IT.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.749
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.050
PLEASE DON'T PUT HIM IN JAIL.
>> COME ON.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.084
>> PLEASE!

24:14.020 --> 24:15.988
BLAKE!
BLAKE, I LOVE YOU!

24:16.022 --> 24:17.557
I LOVE YOU!

24:17.590 --> 24:18.725
>> HAILEY,
TIME TO GO HOME.

24:18.758 --> 24:19.726
>> I LOVE YOU, BLAKE.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.761
>> IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.130
>> ELLEN, ELLEN.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.965
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

24:25.998 --> 24:26.999
THIS IS A GREAT JOB
PARENTING.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.735
YOU LET THE KID JOIN
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.002
>> I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
THIS DISCUSSION HERE.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.103
WE'RE GOING HOME.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.972
>> WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
HE'S STAYING WITH ME.

24:33.005 --> 24:33.906
HE'S STAYING WITH ME.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.942
>> YOU'RE HURTING HER.
>> MR. VAN KUREN!

24:35.975 --> 24:38.244
LET GO OF HER ARM.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.813
>> I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, OKAY.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.014
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.652
>> I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.086
>> LOVE US?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.688
IF YOU LOVE US SO MUCH,
THEN WHY DO YOU GO

24:48.721 --> 24:52.792
TO THE STRIP CLUBS
AND SCREW TRASHY SLUTS?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.662
>> HAILEY, WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT A STRIPPER?

24:55.695 --> 24:58.865
>> MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
MISS BLAINE.

24:58.898 --> 24:59.899
SHE SAID YOU TOLD HER,
MOM.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.635
>> I-I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE STRIPPER.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.304
>> THEN HOW DID SHE?
>> I TOLD YOU.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.974
ELLEN CALLED TO LET ME KNOW
MARK WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,

25:08.007 --> 25:10.076
IN CASE HAILEY WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.077
>> RIGHT,
AND WHEN HAILEY CAME IN,

25:11.110 --> 25:14.280
YOU TOLD HER HER FATHER
WAS SCREWING A STRIPPER

25:14.313 --> 25:15.982
THE NIGHT
HE WAS ATTACKED?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.984
>> IN RETROSPECT,
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.152
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING
TO HER.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.253
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.055
'CAUSE WE NEVER TOLD ELLEN.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.724
ABOUT MARK AND THE STRIPPER.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.258
>> SO THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT

25:26.292 --> 25:29.696
IS IF YOU'D BEEN THERE YOURSELF.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.731
WHAT'D YOU DO,
FOLLOW HIM TO THE STRIP CLUB?

25:45.177 --> 25:46.813
>> I COULDN'T GET
HIS BLOOD OUT.

25:46.846 --> 25:50.817
>> WHY'D YOU DO IT?

25:50.850 --> 25:55.888
>> HAILEY'S PAIN GOT TO BE
MORE THAN I COULD BEAR.

25:55.922 --> 26:01.093
I JUST WANTED
TO PROTECT HER.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.094
>> DO YOU THINK YOU GOT ENOUGH
OF THE STORY

26:02.128 --> 26:02.895
BEFORE JACKIE LAWYERED UP?

26:02.929 --> 26:04.797
>> THE ABRIDGED VERSION
IS PLENTY.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.133
SHE TOLD YOU SHE DID IT,
GAVE YOU THE BLOODSTAINED COAT.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.802
THERE'S MY CASE, SIGNED,
SEALED, AND DELIVERED.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.804
SEE YOU AT ARRAIGNMENT.

26:13.806 --> 26:14.774
>> I WANT TO TAKE IT BACK.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.643
>> TAKE WHAT BACK,
HAILEY?

26:16.676 --> 26:17.944
>> MISS BLAINE NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE STRIPPERS.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.780
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I HEARD IT.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.720
MISS BLAINE, I'M SORRY.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.921
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET YOU
IN TROUBLE.

26:28.955 --> 26:29.922
>> YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER.
>> I HAVE TO.

26:29.956 --> 26:30.857
>> HAILEY, IT'S OKAY.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.725
IT'S OKAY.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.093
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.963
>> IT IS.
I'VE RUINED EVERYONE'S LIVES.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.666
MY PARENTS', BLAKE'S,
MISS BLAINE'S.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.203
>> HAILEY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.

26:44.236 --> 26:48.641
SIT DOWN, HONEY.
SIT DOWN.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.143
>> IT'S NOTHING.
>> SOMEBODY CALL A BUS.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.012
>> HAILEY!
HAILEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

26:53.045 --> 26:55.047
ARE YOU OKAY?

26:55.081 --> 26:57.684
>> I'M COLD.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.060
>> WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

27:08.094 --> 27:10.697
>> IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME,

27:10.730 --> 27:13.165
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH IT.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.901
>> NOT WITH A SON-OF-A-BITCH
FATHER STOPPING HER

27:14.934 --> 27:16.669
FROM BEING WHO SHE REALLY
NEEDS TO BE.

27:16.703 --> 27:20.707
>> THEN GET HAILEY A LAWYER.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.441
I CAN GIVE YOU THE NAMES
OF SOME PEOPLE

27:22.474 --> 27:23.910
WHO CAN ADVOCATE FOR HAILEY,

27:23.943 --> 27:25.778
TAKE THE DECISION AWAY
FROM YOU AND MARK.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.880
>> NEVER THOUGHT
I'D HEAR YOU SUGGESTING

27:27.914 --> 27:29.916
LEGAL REPRESENTATION,
DETECTIVE BENSON.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.183
THAT MUST BE HAILEY.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.820
>> AND YOU MUST BE REPRESENTING
JACKIE BLAINE.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.255
MISS POND.

27:36.288 --> 27:36.956
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.391
>> UH, MY CLIENT WAS CONCERNED

27:39.425 --> 27:41.127
AFTER SHE SAW
YOUR DAUGHTER COLLAPSE.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.228
>> HAILEY'S FINE.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.462
>> I'D LIKE TO SEE
FOR MYSELF.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.133
>> PLEASE GO CLOSE
THE BLINDS.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.068
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
BEING HERE.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.369
>> THE MENTAL HEALTH OF A
KEY WITNESS AGAINST MY CLIENT

27:50.402 --> 27:53.139
IS ABSOLUTELY MY BUSINESS.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.007
>> I DON'T THINK
THAT HAILEY WILL BE TESTIFYING.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.142
WE DON'T NEED HER.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.344
YOUR CLIENT CONFESSED.
SHE'S GUILTY.

28:03.750 --> 28:08.320
>> JACKIE BLAINE LOVES HAILEY
VAN KUREN LIKE A DAUGHTER.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.124
SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT HER.

28:12.158 --> 28:16.028
AND HAILEY WAS DYING
IN FRONT OF HER EYES

28:16.062 --> 28:19.365
BECAUSE HER FATHER WOULDN'T LET
HER TRANSITION.

28:21.333 --> 28:25.504
JACKIE HAD RESPONSIBILITY
TO SAVE THIS LITTLE GIRL

28:25.537 --> 28:28.207
FROM HER FATHER'S ABUSE.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.045
A FATHER WHO WAS DESTROYING
HER SOUL.

28:33.079 --> 28:38.150
A FATHER WHO WOULD RATHER SEE
HIS OWN CHILD COMMIT SUICIDE

28:38.184 --> 28:40.887
THAN ACCEPT THE TRUTH.

28:40.920 --> 28:45.024
A FATHER WHO WOULD RATHER HAVE
A DEAD SON

28:45.057 --> 28:49.028
THAN A BEAUTIFUL, SENSITIVE,

28:49.061 --> 28:52.064
LOVING DAUGHTER.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.001
>> WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.336
POND IS MAKING JACKIE LOOK
LIKE THE PATRON SAINT

28:57.369 --> 29:00.239
OF ABUSED CHILDREN,
AND THE JURY'S BUYING IT.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.074
I NEED HAILEY TO TESTIFY
AGAINST HER.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.309
>> SHE'S A MESS.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.310
DRAGGING HER INTO COURT

29:04.343 --> 29:06.212
COULD PUSH HER
OVER THE EDGE.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.347
>> HAILEY IS THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN TELL THE JURY

29:08.380 --> 29:11.083
SHE DIDN'T WANT JACKIE BLAINE
TO KILL HER FATHER.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.819
>> WELL, YOU SO SURE
SHE DIDN'T?

29:12.852 --> 29:14.854
SHE HATES HER OLD MAN
BECAUSE HE CAN'T ACCEPT HER.

29:14.887 --> 29:15.922
JACKIE BLAINE DOES.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.356
YOU PUT HER ON THE STAND,
HAILEY COULD PLAY RIGHT

29:17.389 --> 29:18.324
INTO POND'S HANDS.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.027
>> THIS MAN LOVES HIS SON.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.862
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
MAY BE MESSED UP,

29:22.895 --> 29:25.297
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME
IT'S NOT WORTH SAVING.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.298
>> HE CARRIES IT
AROUND WITH HIM.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.135
LIKE IT'S PROOF
I'M A BOY.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.502
>> OR BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.538
>> HE LOVES HENRY.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.575
HE WOULDN'T EVEN WALK
DOWN THE STREET WITH ME.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.444
HE'S ASHAMED OF WHO I AM.

29:38.477 --> 29:44.316
>> YOU'RE WRONG.

29:44.350 --> 29:48.487
>> I HATED THAT TRUCK.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.125
I ASKED FOR ONE PRESENT
THAT YEAR.

29:53.159 --> 29:56.262
A BARBIE.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.229
HE JUST SCREAMED AT ME
AND SAID,

29:57.263 --> 29:59.832
"NO SON OF MINE
WILL EVER PLAY WITH DOLLS."

29:59.866 --> 30:03.402
>> HE LOVES THE BOY
HE BOUGHT THE TRUCK FOR.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.304
AND THE BASEBALL CARDS
IN YOUR CLOSET.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.540
HE CAN'T LET HENRY GO.

30:08.574 --> 30:13.379
>> HENRY'S BEEN GONE
A LONG TIME.

30:13.412 --> 30:18.284
IT'S LIKE HE LOVES A GHOST.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.218
IT'S NOT ME.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.521
>> HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE
WHO DIED?

30:26.058 --> 30:29.428
>> MY GRANDMA STELLA.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.300
>> HOW'D YOU FEEL?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.335
>> I CRIED FOR WEEKS.

30:36.368 --> 30:42.208
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE
SHE WAS GONE.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.476
>> THAT'S HOW YOUR DAD FEELS
ABOUT HENRY.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.417
>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

30:51.450 --> 30:55.287
IF YOUR SON CAME HOME
IN A DRESS?

30:55.321 --> 31:00.459
WOULD YOU STILL LOVE HIM?

31:00.492 --> 31:05.431
>> I'D TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.532
IT'D PROBABLY BE VERY HARD.

31:06.565 --> 31:12.171
I'D MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES.

31:12.204 --> 31:16.342
I'D NEVER STOP LOVING HIM.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.921
[Hailey sobs]
IT'S OKAY.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.410
>> MS. BLAINE SAYS
SHE ATTACKED YOUR FATHER

31:51.443 --> 31:53.345
TO PREVENT HIM
FROM KILLING YOU.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.982
>> MY FATHER WASN'T TRYING
TO KILL ME.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.283
>> EVEN THOUGH HE WOULDN'T LET
YOU TRANSITION

31:57.316 --> 31:58.317
OR TAKE HORMONES?

31:58.350 --> 32:01.320
>> IT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHO I AM.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.589
I'M A GIRL.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.424
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GIRL.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.693
>> DID YOU EVER ASK MS. BLAINE
TO HURT YOUR FATHER?

32:07.726 --> 32:11.430
>> NO.
>> DID YOU WANT HER TO?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.603
>> I'M REALLY MAD
AT MY DAD.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.172
>> HAILEY, PLEASE ANSWER

32:20.206 --> 32:23.042
MY QUESTION.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.045
DID YOU WANT MS. BLAINE
TO HURT YOUR FATHER?

32:26.078 --> 32:30.182
>> NO!

32:30.216 --> 32:32.584
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO HURT HIM.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.988
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.433
>> ARE THOSE BANDAGES
ON YOUR ARMS?

32:47.466 --> 32:50.702
>> YES.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.104
>> DID YOU TRY
TO KILL YOURSELF?

32:52.138 --> 32:55.707
>> NO.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.643
I WAS JUST UPSET.

32:57.676 --> 33:03.382
>> THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE BEEN UPSET, IS IT?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.551
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:05.584 --> 33:08.587
>> HAVE YOU EVER TALKED
TO JACKIE BLAINE

33:08.620 --> 33:11.323
ABOUT WANTING
TO KILL YOURSELF?

33:16.762 --> 33:20.599
>> YES.
>> HOW MANY TIMES?

33:20.632 --> 33:22.434
>> I DON'T KNOW.
A COUPLE.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.137
>> TRY EIGHT TIMES

33:25.171 --> 33:28.107
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.775
IN FACT, EVERY TIME
YOU FELT UPSET AT SCHOOL,

33:29.808 --> 33:31.377
YOU WENT TO SEE MS. BLAINE.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.578
>> SHE WAS MY FRIEND.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.146
>> YOU'D SPEND HOURS
IN THE OFFICE.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.183
CRYING, TELLING HER
HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.585
>> YES.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.320
>> DID YOU EVER TALK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.825
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.462
>> WELL, LET ME REFRESH
YOUR MEMORY.

33:50.496 --> 33:54.466
ACCORDING TO
MS. BLAINE'S NOTES,

33:54.500 --> 33:57.336
EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TALKED
TO HER,

33:57.369 --> 33:59.105
YOU SAID YOU WISHED
YOUR FATHER WAS DEAD,

33:59.138 --> 34:00.539
DIDN'T YOU?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.413
>> YES.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.516
>> DO YOU THINK
JACKIE BLAINE CARES ABOUT YOU?

34:10.549 --> 34:11.783
>> I KNOW SHE DOES.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.553
>> AND SHE WANTS TO HELP YOU?

34:14.586 --> 34:18.357
>> YES.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.226
>> DOES YOUR FATHER CARE
ABOUT YOU?

34:20.259 --> 34:21.827
DOES HE WANT TO HELP YOU?

34:25.664 --> 34:28.300
>> I DON'T KNOW.

34:28.334 --> 34:32.171
>> SO, YOU TOLD THIS WOMAN,
WHO CARES FOR YOU DEEPLY,

34:32.204 --> 34:35.374
THAT YOUR FATHER WAS
AN ABUSIVE MONSTER

34:35.407 --> 34:36.708
AND YOU WANTED HIM DEAD.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.544
AND NOW YOU'VE TOLD US
THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT

34:38.577 --> 34:41.680
ANYONE TO HURT HIM.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.316
WHICH IS IT,
HAILEY?

34:47.386 --> 34:50.789
>> I DON'T KNOW.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.664
>> WHAT WAS HAILEY'S
BIGGEST ISSUE WITH HER FATHER?

34:58.697 --> 35:01.167
>> HORMONE BLOCKERS.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.436
SHE WANTED DESPERATELY
TO BEGIN TAKING THEM.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.437
BUT HE WOULDN'T LET HER.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.807
>> HOW DID THAT MAKE HER FEEL?

35:08.840 --> 35:10.542
>> DEVASTATED.

35:10.576 --> 35:14.146
SHE SAID
HER LIFE WASN'T WORTH LIVING

35:14.180 --> 35:18.317
IF SHE COULDN'T BE A GIRL.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.719
WHAT IF YOU WOKE UP
TOMORROW MORNING

35:20.752 --> 35:23.622
IN THE BODY
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX,

35:23.655 --> 35:27.859
BUT NOTHING ELSE ABOUT YOU
HAD CHANGED?

35:27.893 --> 35:30.662
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW TRAPPED YOU'D FEEL?

35:30.696 --> 35:32.398
CAN YOU IMAGINE

35:32.431 --> 35:34.600
HOW'D DESPERATE YOU'D BE
TO GET BACK

35:34.633 --> 35:37.669
INTO THE RIGHT BODY?

35:37.703 --> 35:40.439
THAT'S HOW HAILEY FEELS.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.308
SHE'S TRAPPED

35:42.341 --> 35:44.410
IN THE WRONG BODY,
AND SHE HAS TO GET OUT.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.681
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.717
>> KNEW WHAT?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.619
>> THAT I HAD
TO SAVE HAILEY.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.222
I COULDN'T LET
HER FATHER KILL

35:56.255 --> 35:58.757
THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL
INSIDE OF HER.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.461
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SHOT HER
IN THE HEART.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.196
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.737
>> YOUR LOVE FOR HAILEY
IS VERY TOUCHING.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.972
DID YOU EVER THINK
YOU MIGHT BE GETTING

36:14.005 --> 36:15.641
A LITTLE TOO INVOLVED?

36:15.674 --> 36:16.642
>> SHE NEEDED ME.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.477
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.412
>> SHE HAS HER MOTHER,

36:20.446 --> 36:22.681
WHO'S BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.784
>> ELLEN'S A GOOD PARENT,
BUT I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.354
I'M TRAINED
TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.622
>> I'M SURE A LOT
OF YOUR STUDENTS HAVE ISSUES.

36:30.656 --> 36:31.857
DO YOU GET INVOLVED
IN THEIR LIVES

36:31.890 --> 36:34.660
TO THE EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT
YOU GOT INVOLVED IN HAILEY'S?

36:34.693 --> 36:37.863
>> NO, SHE'S VERY SPECIAL.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.999
>> DO YOU COUNSEL STUDENTS
WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED?

36:41.032 --> 36:43.702
>> YES.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.671
>> VICTIMS OF INCEST?

36:45.704 --> 36:46.538
>> YES.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.775
>> HOW ABOUT DRUG ADDICTS?
BULIMICS?

36:49.808 --> 36:50.842
ANOREXICS?
BINGE DRINKERS?

36:50.876 --> 36:52.944
>> YES. YES. YES.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.480
BUT HAILEY IS DIFFERENT.

36:54.513 --> 36:55.681
>> CLEARLY.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.682
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TO KILL
THE DAD

36:56.715 --> 36:57.883
WHO RAPES HIS DAUGHTER

36:57.916 --> 36:59.785
OR THE MOM
WHO BEATS HER SON.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.620
I GUESS
THEY'RE NOT SPECIAL ENOUGH

37:01.653 --> 37:02.721
TO DESERVE YOUR DEVOTION.

37:02.754 --> 37:03.555
>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.990
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE GO THROUGH.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.593
>> WE?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.469
MS. BLAINE, HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN KNOWN BY ANOTHER NAME?

37:17.503 --> 37:18.704
>> OBJECTION.
RELEVANCE.

37:18.737 --> 37:22.574
>> OVERRULED.

37:22.608 --> 37:26.678
ANSWER THE QUESTION,
MS. BLAINE.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.789
>> YES.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.560
>> WHAT WAS YOUR NAME?

37:44.796 --> 37:47.666
>> HAROLD FRANKLIN.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.636
>> WHAT?

37:50.669 --> 37:51.870
>> YOUR HONOR,
I NEED TO CONFER

37:51.903 --> 37:53.539
WITH MY CLIENT.
>> NO.

37:53.572 --> 37:58.377
I NEED TO EXPLAIN.

38:06.051 --> 38:09.755
I ALWAYS KNEW
I WAS A GIRL.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.825
BUT THINGS WERE DIFFERENT
BACK THEN.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.794
THERE WERE NO PILLS.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.564
NO COUNSELORS.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.965
NO SUPPORT GROUPS.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.701
YOU HAD TO LIVE AS A WOMAN
FOR THREE YEARS

38:22.734 --> 38:24.403
BEFORE A DOCTOR
WOULD EVEN CONSIDER

38:24.436 --> 38:27.573
DOING THE SURGERY.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.941
IT WAS HARD.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.311
BUT I HAD NO CHOICE.

38:37.683 --> 38:41.052
I WAS LEAVING A BAR,

38:41.086 --> 38:43.489
AND THREE MEN GRABBED ME.

38:46.057 --> 38:50.061
THEY CALLED ME A FREAK.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.098
THEY DRAGGED ME
INTO A VACANT LOT,

38:53.131 --> 38:55.934
AND THEY PULLED UP
MY SKIRT.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.838
AND ONE OF THEM TOOK OUT
A KNIFE.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.441
AND HE SAID IF YOU WANT
TO BE A WOMAN

39:02.474 --> 39:05.877
SO BADLY...

39:05.911 --> 39:09.881
I'LL MAKE YOU ONE.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.718
AND HE CUT ME.

39:33.505 --> 39:37.676
>> MISS GREYLEK,
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.977
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> THE TRIAL. EVERYTHING.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.179
JUST STOP IT.
>> MARK, IT'S TOO LATE.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.815
>> WELL, I'M THE VICTIM.
I WANT TO DROP THE CHARGES.

39:43.849 --> 39:47.519
>> YOU CAN'T.
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.755
>> NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IF I WOULD HAVE JUST--

39:49.788 --> 39:52.624
IF I WOULD HAVE JUST LISTENED
TO MY DAUGHTER.

39:52.658 --> 39:53.725
WHEN SHE SAID
THAT TAKING THOSE PILLS WAS

39:53.759 --> 39:57.128
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.831
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT MYSELF

39:59.865 --> 40:02.167
AND HOW EMBARRASSING
IT WOULD BE

40:02.200 --> 40:04.770
WHEN MY FRIENDS FOUND OUT
THAT HAILEY WAS HENRY.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.205
>> JACKIE BLAINE TRIED
TO KILL YOU.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.974
SHE CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.176
>> SO THAT'S IT?

40:11.209 --> 40:13.612
>> I'M SORRY.

40:22.888 --> 40:23.989
OH, NO,
NOT YOU TOO.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.024
>> THAT GUY'S GOT A POINT.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.025
>> YOU WANT EVERY PERSON

40:27.058 --> 40:28.594
WHO'S EVER BEEN A VICTIM
TO HAVE

40:28.627 --> 40:30.028
AN AUTOMATIC
GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARD

40:30.061 --> 40:31.029
WHEN THEY GO LOOKING
FOR RETRIBUTION?

40:31.062 --> 40:33.031
>> YOU'RE NEW HERE, KIM.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.033
>> WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
THE "SVU IS GRAY" SPEECH?

40:35.066 --> 40:38.169
>> SOME CASES HAVE
NO RIGHT ANSWER.

40:38.203 --> 40:41.006
>> SO SHE WALKS?
>> NO.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.041
OFFER 'EM A PLEA BARGAIN.
I'M SURE THEY'D TAKE IT.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.017
>> I UNDERSTAND
THE DEFENDANT WISHES

40:52.050 --> 40:53.619
TO CHANGE HER PLEA.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.562
>> YES, YOUR HONOR.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.663
I'M GUILTY.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.666
>> THEN IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE ARRANGEMENT REACHED

41:07.699 --> 41:10.001
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE,

41:10.035 --> 41:12.904
I HEREBY SENTENCE YOU
TO EIGHT YEARS.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.940
[pounds gavel]

41:25.216 --> 41:28.219
>> JACKIE.

41:28.253 --> 41:32.591
>> HAILEY, I'M SORRY.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.894
>> MY DAD'S LETTING ME TAKE
THE BLOCKERS.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.566
>> I'M GLAD.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.819
>> I WANNA GO HOME.

42:03.221 --> 42:06.224
