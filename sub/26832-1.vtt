he catches the thing

the next night,

Open the gate!

Ford! Ford, come on!

01:36:58.801 --> 01:37:01.469
The tower, Private Boyce.

(GROWLING)

01:37:16.701 --> 01:37:18.635
I think I'm done with this.

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:22.269
Thanks.

REPORTER: <i>Under the command

ROBERT ST. JOHN:
<i>This is a momentous hour</i>

<i>in world history.</i>

01:39:12.602 --> 01:39:15.998
<i>This is the invasion
of Hitler's Europe.</i>

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.532
<i>The zero hour

01:39:18.534 --> 01:39:20.799
<i>The men of General
Dwight Eisenhower</i>

01:39:26.601 --> 01:39:28.066
Yeah, Boyce!

01:39:28.068 --> 01:39:30.166
<i>They are moving in from
the sea to attack the enemy</i>

01:39:30.168 --> 01:39:32.333
<i>under a mammoth cloud

<i>but a large proportion

01:39:44.101 --> 01:39:46.199

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:39:58.135 --> 01:39:59.402
TIBBET: Ford?

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.465
You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,

01:40:20.467 --> 01:40:22.731
but you went below
to set the charges.

01:40:22.733 --> 01:40:24.532
BOYCE: Yes, sir.

01:40:24.534 --> 01:40:27.266
Why would you do something
like that, Private?

01:40:27.268 --> 01:40:30.098
Corporal Ford thought
it was best.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:33.631
The number of
enemy troops, he...

01:40:33.633 --> 01:40:37.302
He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.

01:40:38.567 --> 01:40:41.764
Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.

01:40:41.766 --> 01:40:44.232
I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.

01:40:44.234 --> 01:40:45.564
So do I, sir.

01:40:45.566 --> 01:40:46.532
Go catch a breath.

01:40:46.534 --> 01:40:48.269
We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.

01:40:49.268 --> 01:40:50.601
At ease, Private.

01:40:53.968 --> 01:40:55.369
Oh, Private?

01:41:00.368 --> 01:41:03.032
Did you see anything else
when you were down there?

01:41:03.034 --> 01:41:06.634
There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.

01:41:07.401 --> 01:41:08.698
So if there's anything
down there

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.601
that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,

01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:14.267
you'd let us know, right?

01:41:17.334 --> 01:41:19.402
Just the tower control room.

01:41:20.534 --> 01:41:22.802
But there's nothing
left of that, sir.

01:41:25.666 --> 01:41:27.066
That's what I figured.

01:41:27.068 --> 01:41:29.266
Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.

01:41:29.268 --> 01:41:30.735
Thank you, sir.

01:41:33.167 --> 01:41:34.298
TIBBET: No wilds.

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.433
Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.

01:41:36.435 --> 01:41:39.665
Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.

He throws two,
and I calls me that...

01:41:45.135 --> 01:41:46.598
Finally got yourself a friend.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.465
PAUL: Hey!

01:41:47.467 --> 01:41:49.302
Kid's bugging the hell
out of me.

01:41:49.934 --> 01:41:51.664
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:41:51.666 --> 01:41:53.099
All right. Two to you.

01:41:53.101 --> 01:41:54.632
- You look better.
- ROSENFELD: Thanks.

01:41:54.634 --> 01:41:56.098
Now I just got to
convince somebody

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.732
how I helped save the war.

01:41:57.734 --> 01:42:00.699
TIBBET: Save the war?
All I saw was you missing

01:42:00.701 --> 01:42:02.499
a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.

01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:04.365
ROSENFELD: Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.

01:42:04.367 --> 01:42:06.298
TIBBET: Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.

01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.734
Do you remember that?

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.065
No? That's what I thought.

01:42:10.067 --> 01:42:11.166
Did you get your orders?

01:42:11.168 --> 01:42:12.499
Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.

01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:14.698
Jesus Christ,
after all that?

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.701
I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.

01:42:17.701 --> 01:42:18.699
Got a job to finish.

01:42:18.701 --> 01:42:20.968
We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.

01:42:22.567 --> 01:42:23.998
And then pop!

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.467
We all go home.
