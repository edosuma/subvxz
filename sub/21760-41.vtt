Cadpig:
Ah, spring,
a season of renewal.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.710
The flowers are blooming,
the birds are chirping.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.670
Nanny is ridding the house

01:23.670 --> 01:26.420
of Cruella's electronic
surveillance devices.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.330
Phew!

01:37.420 --> 01:39.750
I hate spring.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.920
How am I supposed to spy
on my employees

01:42.920 --> 01:48.250
to make sure they're not doing
the kind of dirty double-dealing
that got me where I am today?

01:48.250 --> 01:50.830
The sewing room monitor's
still working, Ms. De Vil.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.830
-Ah.

01:54.170 --> 01:56.120
The delivery is all set.

01:56.120 --> 02:00.830
Oh, I can't wait to see
Duchess and Princess
in my new designs.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.920
Duchess

02:06.580 --> 02:11.120
So, Anita's secretly designing
for royal clients.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.460
I bet she's planning
to start her own company
and run me out of business.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.120
Uh-oh. Found another camera.

02:20.580 --> 02:21.960
Cruella:
Rats!

02:23.540 --> 02:26.920
Ugh, so much for
Miss nosy-body Cruella.

02:28.170 --> 02:30.500
-Hm.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.920
Congratulations, Nanny.
You are the proud winner

02:34.920 --> 02:37.210
of the Grutely Glamor
Galleria's Day of Beauty.

02:37.210 --> 02:39.250
Tell her what she's won,
Hortense.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.290
A magic carpet
to a more beautiful you,

02:42.290 --> 02:45.080
including a complete makeover:

02:45.080 --> 02:47.960
hairdo, manicure, leg-waxing,

02:47.960 --> 02:51.040
and each and every toe
painted with scenes
from cartoon shows.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.620
But I...
I've got work to do.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.920
Come on, now.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.620
Let's get beautiful.

03:00.620 --> 03:01.920
Whoa!

03:03.210 --> 03:07.120
Oh, it just needs a deeper
neckline or something.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.420
Nanny, there's someone
at the door!

03:12.040 --> 03:13.750
Where is she?

03:20.120 --> 03:23.080
What is that?
I mean, who is that?

03:23.080 --> 03:24.250
All:
Hm?

03:24.250 --> 03:28.210
Hello. My name is Cr--
Cranny.

03:28.210 --> 03:30.500
I'm your new
housekeeper.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.500
Housekeeper?
Where's Nanny?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.040
Oh!

03:36.040 --> 03:38.330
Oh, look,
she left a note behind.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.620
"Dear Anita,
I've been called away.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.420
My old friend Cranny
will cover for me
while I'm gone."

03:50.420 --> 03:52.380
That's very strange.

03:52.380 --> 03:55.580
It's not like Nanny
to suddenly take off
without a word.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.080
She smells awfully familiar.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.170
It's kind of like a cross
between eau de cologne
and old gym socks.

04:03.170 --> 04:06.170
It's sweet of you
to fill in for Nanny.

04:06.170 --> 04:08.040
I guess you can start
with the vacuuming.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.040
If you need me,
I'll be upstairs
in my sewing room.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.670
Mm-hmm.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.710
I thought she'd never leave.

04:16.170 --> 04:19.120
I can hardly breathe
in this mask.

04:20.330 --> 04:21.750
All:
Cruella!

04:21.750 --> 04:24.380
I knew she smelled
familiar.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.250
Yes.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.580
These must be
Anita's royal designs.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.000
-Oh!

04:35.880 --> 04:38.330
Oh, good.
You found my portfolio.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.040
The vacuum's in the closet.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.460
She's got to be
up to no good.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.080
We have to expose her
for the phony she is.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.000
I'll bet Cruella's also
the reason Nanny disappeared.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.830
I just hope Nanny's okay.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.250
Nanny:
Oh, my goodness.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.580
Oh, that tickles.

05:07.330 --> 05:10.210
Hm, that's pretty.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.210
Now do the other one in teal.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.920
Hm.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.580
How does one work
this carpet

05:20.580 --> 05:22.750
Hello? Hello!

05:22.750 --> 05:23.960
Clean the room.

05:23.960 --> 05:28.250
I can tell this house
is in no danger
of being cleaned.

05:28.250 --> 05:31.120
Maybe she just needs
a little help.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.710
Uh-oh.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.380
Oh! Stupid thing.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.120
-Ah! Oof!

05:57.460 --> 05:58.830
Ah!

05:59.960 --> 06:00.880
Ugh!

06:00.880 --> 06:02.460
Where's Spot?

06:19.170 --> 06:22.120
-Anita: Cranny,
is everything all right?

06:22.120 --> 06:25.040
Oh, fine, fine.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.420
I just, uh, sneezed.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.210
Oh, gosh,
I hope you aren't
catching a cold.

06:30.210 --> 06:33.080
I'll be down in a few minutes
to give you some vitamin C.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.040
Hello, Springtime
Cleaning Service?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.380
All:
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut
hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.380
All:
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut
hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.500
Ah! She's good.

06:54.420 --> 06:58.580
Hello
One o'clock? Oh, that's perfect.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.830
That's when I'll be doing
a fitting with Duchess
and Princess.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.880
Oh, they'll be
so thrilled.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.830
So, Duchess and Princess
will be here at one.

07:06.830 --> 07:09.830
Well, it's time they met
a real designer.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.710
Hello?
Oh, yes, Cruella.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.540
Lunch

07:18.540 --> 07:21.920
Uh, sure,
you're always welcome.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.120
See you at one.
Kiss, kiss.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.880
Once they've met
the one and only Cruella,

07:27.880 --> 07:30.120
Anita's royal clients
will be mine.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.500
Now, to rush home and put on
something befitting
the occasion.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.500
Oh, Cranny,
there you are.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.170
My boss is coming over
and I need you to make us
some lunch.

07:41.170 --> 07:45.380
Oh. Uh...
But, Mrs. Dearly, I, uh...

07:45.380 --> 07:47.960
I have to run out
and buy some, uh, clothes...

07:47.960 --> 07:50.330
for the, um... clothesline.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.960
Oh, please, Cranny.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.880
My boss is very picky.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.380
This is a job
for a professional
like yourself.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.750
But...

08:00.460 --> 08:02.210
Anita:
Cruella will be here
any minute.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.500
Hello, Deli De Vil?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.790
I want some food
delivered to Dearly Farm.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.250
Oh, man.
She's ordering lunch.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.710
All:
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut
hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

08:14.710 --> 08:16.830
All:
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut
hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.420
She's outsmarted us again.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.880
Enough games.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.170
Let's cut right to the chase.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.080
Oh! Oh!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.250
Cruella:
Come back with my mask,
you vicious--

08:34.250 --> 08:36.380
Oh! You can't
get away from me.

08:38.330 --> 08:39.500
Aha!

08:46.830 --> 08:48.880
Anita! Rubdown.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.880
I, uh... Oh!

08:50.880 --> 08:53.580
I thought I'd drop by early.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.960
Oh. Well, great.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.330
Now, that you're here,
let's eat lunch.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.540
Cranny will serve us.
Cranny?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.500
Uh... gotta go
wash up.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.620
Um, is it my imagination
or is that woman
wearing our drapes?

09:15.170 --> 09:17.960
Oh! Don't even think about it.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.880
Somebody, get that mask!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.710
-Ugh!

09:32.250 --> 09:36.000
Let go,
you smelly flea bag.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.960
Yoo-hoo! Lunch is served.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.620
-Cranny!

09:46.620 --> 09:48.000
What happened to you?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.170
Uh-oh.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.000
There's no reason
to get angry.

09:54.670 --> 09:56.620
Sheesh! What an attitude.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.790
Now's our chance
to expose her.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.460
Normally, I'm against
unprovoked violence,

10:03.460 --> 10:06.540
But, in this case,
trash her!

10:17.040 --> 10:19.830
Cruella, you're Cranny?

10:19.830 --> 10:22.170
But why the disguise?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.580
Never mind that.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.500
Why are you
keeping this Duchess
and Princess all to yourself?

10:28.500 --> 10:29.960
How could you?

10:29.960 --> 10:32.120
After all I've done for you?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.250
Duchess

10:34.250 --> 10:36.580
You mean, you want
to meet them?

10:36.580 --> 10:39.120
They're right outside
in the barn.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.710
The one place
I'd never look.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.250
Oh, you are a sly minx.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.710
Here they are.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.500
Duchesss and Princess.

10:50.670 --> 10:52.540
Your Highnesses.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.920
It is such an honor
to meet you.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.330
-I don't recognize
that accent.

10:59.330 --> 11:01.670
You must

11:01.670 --> 11:03.290
Cows?

11:03.290 --> 11:06.790
And these covers are
going to keep them all
snuggly warm this winter.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.960
Right, girls?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.830
These are for
a couple of smelly old cows?

11:14.670 --> 11:18.420
Oof! Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Ooh!

11:18.420 --> 11:21.960
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.500
I'm calling my lawyer.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.330
What just happened here?

11:25.330 --> 11:30.670
Well, as near as I can tell,
Cruella just wanted to meet
our cows.

11:30.670 --> 11:33.540
I will never figure
that woman out.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.420
Oh!

11:45.380 --> 11:50.960
Okay, guys, get ready for
the mama of all belly flops.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.880
-Go for it!

11:54.170 --> 11:55.830
You call that a high dive?

11:55.830 --> 11:58.620
My grandmother jumps off
sofas taller than that.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.080
Would your grandmother
jump off of this?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.750
Why stop there?

12:11.750 --> 12:14.210
Why not from that branch?

12:18.540 --> 12:20.330
I was kidding!

12:20.330 --> 12:22.710
What's the matter?
You chicken?

12:22.710 --> 12:25.080
Bawk, bawk, ba-gawk!
Bawk, bawk!

12:25.080 --> 12:27.670
Actually, it's more
from the epiglottis.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.580
Like this:
Ba-gawk!

12:29.580 --> 12:32.380
Come on, are you
a canine or a capon?

12:32.380 --> 12:36.210
Lucky, let me see, how can I
put this delicately?

12:36.210 --> 12:38.750
Have you gone barn

12:38.750 --> 12:42.000
Ah, don't sweat it, sis.
Piece of cake.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.500
Yeah!

12:48.460 --> 12:50.790
See, guys,
I told ya,
piece of c-- ugh.

12:52.540 --> 12:55.170
A piece of cugh?
What kind of cake is that?

13:01.580 --> 13:03.540
There you go, Lucky.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.540
Just some minor lacerations.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.170
You're gonna be
just fine.

13:07.170 --> 13:10.210
Give it a week
and you'll be as good as new.

13:10.210 --> 13:12.540
She says he'll be
good as new.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.830
-Good.
-Phew.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.380
And to make sure you don't
pull those stitches out,

13:16.380 --> 13:19.460
I'm fitting you
with a nice new cone.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.420
She's fitting him
with a nice new cone.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.620
Both: The cone?

13:28.580 --> 13:31.290
What's so bad
about a cone?

13:31.290 --> 13:34.500
It's only the single most
embarrassing, humiliating,

13:34.500 --> 13:38.580
and totally uncool thing
ever invented by
veterinary medicine.

13:38.580 --> 13:41.580
Come on, it can't be
that bad.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.290
Okay, time to rejoin the gang.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.960
Look, I know you're
a bit skittish, but
after an accident,

13:55.960 --> 13:59.460
the best thing to do
is get right back out there.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.460
Poor little guy.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.620
He looks silly in that thing.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.250
At least he doesn't know it.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.920
That's the way
people should be.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.330
We're all so obsessed
with appearances

14:12.330 --> 14:14.420
when it's really
what's inside that counts.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.540
I mean, who cares
what you look like?

14:21.540 --> 14:22.420
Huh?

14:22.420 --> 14:24.420
I'm bald!

14:27.170 --> 14:28.500
Okay, here he comes.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.750
Now remember,
no matter how bad it looks,

14:30.750 --> 14:33.420
pretend you don't
notice it.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.620
Hey, Luck,
how's it goin'?

14:36.620 --> 14:39.250
Lookin' good.

14:39.250 --> 14:43.540
Yeah, I didn't even notice
your giant, nerdy, plastic cone.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.380
Ow! What?

14:45.380 --> 14:47.960
Okay, I know I look
like a dork.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.920
You guys don't have to cover.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.080
Who's covering?
We're not covering.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.040
What's up with home dog?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.670
-Must have lost a bet.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.460
Pay no attention.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.460
You know,
mad cow disease.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.920
Ooh, you'd better
take it slow, boy.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.750
You don't want
to bust your lampshade.

15:13.290 --> 15:17.080
He's not laughing at you.
He's laughing with you.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.170
Uh-oh.

15:25.170 --> 15:28.290
Hey, look, we got us
a snow cone boy.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.460
Let me guess,
loser flavor?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.420
Okay, so I've got
a bald spot.

15:35.420 --> 15:39.210
Who cares? Beauty is
only skin deep.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.750
It's what's inside that counts.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.920
Anita:
Roger, lunch is ready.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.380
Uh, yeah, coming!

15:45.380 --> 15:48.460
As soon as I hide
my hideous, naked skull.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.500
This should do the trick.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.620
Huh? Perfect.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.750
All right, remember,

16:09.750 --> 16:12.420
style is 99% attitude,

16:12.420 --> 16:14.960
and one percent
revolving credit.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.330
So, let's see
you sell it, bubbe!

16:28.120 --> 16:30.330
Ah! Whoa!

16:34.830 --> 16:36.750
Hey, fountain face.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.790
I've been looking
for a new birdbath.

16:42.210 --> 16:47.330
Now, this time, don't just
wear the cone, be the cone!

16:59.750 --> 17:01.210
Whoa!

17:02.620 --> 17:05.170
Ah!

17:12.210 --> 17:15.250
Hey, cone-head,
what's your next
impersonation?

17:15.250 --> 17:16.500
A speed bump?

17:25.790 --> 17:27.120
Hm.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.620
Ugh.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.210
Aah!

17:45.620 --> 17:48.920
Goodbye, glare.
Hello, hair.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.250
Achoo!

18:02.750 --> 18:05.710
Come out here
and work that magic!

18:09.040 --> 18:12.750
I look like
a giant freckle, don't I?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.880
All:
Uh...

18:14.880 --> 18:19.170
Maybe if we put
a bag over your head.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.620
Okay, that's it.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.580
I've had it with
trying to hide this thing.

18:22.580 --> 18:25.830
If I've got to wear a cone,
I've got to wear a cone.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.250
Hey, Capgun,
can I borrow your
satellite dish?

18:30.250 --> 18:32.500
We're trying to get
the game from Pakistan.

18:35.330 --> 18:37.170
Aah!

18:37.170 --> 18:38.920
Okay, barrel-butt!

18:38.920 --> 18:41.420
Meet me down at
Hiccup Hole in 10 minutes.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.500
We've got a score
to settle.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.460
Your stitches are
almost healed.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.290
But what about
what the doctor said?

18:57.290 --> 18:59.250
Won't you tear your stitches?

18:59.250 --> 19:01.120
Just pull!

19:06.080 --> 19:08.500
At last, freedom.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.580
Now, I can challenge Mooch
on equal footing.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.380
And how is your head
supposed to heal?

19:14.380 --> 19:15.830
Magic?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.210
This has gotta fit.

19:19.210 --> 19:23.210
It's from my old Junior Houdini
Hocus-Pocus kit.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.210
Anita:
Roger, we're waiting.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.960
Oh, what am I gonna do?

19:40.250 --> 19:42.170
Ha! Hm.

19:42.170 --> 19:44.290
Too over-the-top.

19:52.170 --> 19:55.000
I have a bad feeling
about this.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Okay, here's the deal.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.620
A double jump. Whoever makes
the bigger splash, wins.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.080
What about your stitches,
Luckless?

20:04.080 --> 20:06.670
You just let me
worry about that.

20:06.670 --> 20:11.670
Pardon me, but is there
any chance I can make
a tiny plea for sanity?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.420
Aah!

20:14.540 --> 20:17.080
-Geronimo!
-Bombs away!

20:18.120 --> 20:20.620
I didn't think so.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.250
What on earth was that?

20:33.170 --> 20:35.620
Anybody remember
Dr. Winokur's number?

20:37.380 --> 20:40.710
No dice. She put up a curtain.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.750
They've been in there for hours.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.960
Just remember,
when he comes out,

20:46.960 --> 20:49.380
act completely natural.

20:58.830 --> 21:03.250
I'm sorry, Lucky.
It's just that...

21:03.250 --> 21:05.210
You look so--

21:05.210 --> 21:06.580
Stupid?

21:11.460 --> 21:12.830
Yes!

21:12.830 --> 21:14.670
Well, I was stupid.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.620
I could have been
really hurt.

21:16.620 --> 21:20.120
This time, I'm gonna
wear the cone no matter
what it looks like.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.750
Besides, the cone
isn't the worst thing
that can happen to you.

21:36.710 --> 21:40.000
Dr. Winokur, we're so glad
you could stay for gazpa--

21:40.000 --> 21:41.750
cho.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.080
Well, um, I seem to have this...

21:48.080 --> 21:49.960
Bald spot?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.290
You know?

21:51.290 --> 21:53.080
I've always known,

21:53.080 --> 21:55.000
but it's never made
a difference to me.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.880
After all, beauty is only
skin deep.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.290
It's what's inside that counts.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.460
Whatever you do,
don't mention
the love handles.
