have you hung yourself yet?</i>

01:50.781 --> 01:52.384
<i>Or what if I told you</i>

<i>this was actually
a story about super-zeroes?</i>

Everything before the "but"
is baloney.

remember what it felt like

You've been
in a terrible accident, Cliff.

09:40.719 --> 09:44.422
Much of your body
was rendered beyond repair.

09:44.455 --> 09:47.258
But we are getting there.

09:47.291 --> 09:51.341
I promise you, we're close.

[Cliff] Fuck.

-Fuck.

10:16.687 --> 10:20.890
1995?

10:20.924 --> 10:21.960
Yes.

10:21.994 --> 10:26.797
Fuck.
Nineteen ninety-fucking-five?

10:26.831 --> 10:28.065
[Niles] Up-uh.

10:28.099 --> 10:30.168
[Cliff] My wife. Where...

10:30.201 --> 10:31.503
Where's my wife?

10:31.535 --> 10:35.706
Cliff, this might be
difficult to process.

10:35.740 --> 10:38.743
The world thinks
you died in 1988.

10:38.777 --> 10:40.410
[Cliff exhales sharply]

10:40.445 --> 10:41.613
I'm not dead.

10:41.645 --> 10:43.981
And getting stronger
every day.

10:44.015 --> 10:46.018
You motherfucker!
What did you do to me?

10:46.051 --> 10:51.051
-How about we take a break?
-No, wait...

10:55.225 --> 10:56.760
Chief's a good man.

10:56.794 --> 11:00.163
Big heart. Little odd,
maybe a little vague.

11:00.197 --> 11:02.500
But it comes
from a good place.

11:02.533 --> 11:06.104
Me, I'll always
tell you the truth.

11:06.138 --> 11:09.640
The Chief told you
the world assumes you're dead.

11:09.673 --> 11:11.109
Did he tell you that's because

11:11.143 --> 11:15.346
the only part of you
he was able to save
was your brain?

11:15.379 --> 11:16.748
[Cliff] No.

11:16.780 --> 11:19.283
Which means we need to talk
about expectations.

11:19.317 --> 11:21.686
What you really, really want.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.554
-[Cliff] I wanna go home.
-And then,

11:23.587 --> 11:25.490
we need to take
those expectations,

11:25.523 --> 11:27.325
we need to give them
a gentle pat

11:27.357 --> 11:29.494
and flush them into the ocean.

11:29.527 --> 11:32.096
What... What's that?

11:32.129 --> 11:34.732
Oh, my God. No!

11:34.765 --> 11:39.416
I... No. No, wait,
what's that?

11:44.808 --> 11:48.111
I told you he wasn't ready.

11:48.144 --> 11:52.345
Everyone deserves the truth.

11:53.317 --> 11:56.354
[Niles] <i>You don't look like
the person you used to be.</i>

11:56.386 --> 11:58.822
<i>There's no
getting around that.</i>

11:58.855 --> 12:00.258
But...

12:00.291 --> 12:01.893
We found you some clothes.

12:01.927 --> 12:06.163
Hopefully, you'll see
you're still very much you.

12:06.197 --> 12:08.666
[Cliff] Sure.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.368
So, what is this place?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.802
My home.

12:11.836 --> 12:13.971
A safe place for you,

12:14.004 --> 12:15.539
others like you,

12:15.572 --> 12:16.740
to heal.

12:16.774 --> 12:18.643
[Cliff] Where's my wife?

12:18.676 --> 12:23.048
What do you remember, Cliff?

12:23.081 --> 12:26.384
-Fuck you, Cliff! Fuck you!
-What the fuck
am I supposed to...

12:26.417 --> 12:30.822
Mommy!

12:30.855 --> 12:33.390
[Cliff] Just tell me
she's moved on.

12:33.423 --> 12:34.759
It's been seven years.

12:34.793 --> 12:36.192
She thinks I'm dead.

12:36.226 --> 12:37.595
She's moved on.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.764
I would have.

12:39.798 --> 12:43.567
[both arguing loudly]

12:43.600 --> 12:45.736
[shouting indistinctly]

12:45.769 --> 12:46.971
[powering down]

12:47.004 --> 12:48.173
[Cliff] I can't hold a memory.

12:48.173 --> 12:50.875
Everything's fractured.
Everything's bad.

12:50.908 --> 12:55.111
You're experiencing something
called dissociative memory.

12:55.145 --> 12:56.413
It'll all come back.

12:56.447 --> 12:58.416
The bad and the good.

12:58.448 --> 12:59.817
We'll get you on your feet.

12:59.850 --> 13:04.850
You'll start feeling
like yourself soon enough.

13:06.222 --> 13:09.059
Cliff Steele, Larry Trainor.

13:09.094 --> 13:14.094
I thought he might help you
with your recovery.

13:23.908 --> 13:27.245
[Morden] <i>And Larry
gave Cliff the grand tour.</i>

13:27.278 --> 13:29.880
<i>Wheeling him around
like a couple of pony kegs</i>

13:29.914 --> 13:32.750
<i>through this home,
we'll come to know as...</i>

13:32.783 --> 13:35.634
<i>Doom Manor.</i>

13:43.928 --> 13:48.928
[Larry] I thought you might
like some air.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.803
[Cliff] I can't feel the air.

13:52.836 --> 13:56.475
[Larry] Sucks to be you.

13:56.508 --> 14:00.644
[Cliff] Hey, what was it like
getting buried
in a pyramid with your cat?

14:00.677 --> 14:02.513
[Larry] Yeah, a sense of humor
helps here.

14:02.547 --> 14:04.783
So you'll work on that.

14:04.816 --> 14:07.250
[Cliff] So what's your story?

14:07.284 --> 14:09.386
[inhales deeply]

14:09.419 --> 14:10.554
[exhales]

14:10.587 --> 14:13.390
I flew airplanes.

14:13.423 --> 14:14.859
[Morden] <i>Flew airplanes?</i>

14:52.330 --> 14:53.932
[John] Hmm.

14:53.965 --> 14:57.701
Let's see. We've got
57,000 pounds force of thrust.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.236
Mach 6,

14:59.270 --> 15:04.174

17:45.936 --> 17:50.008
But you know,
there's always tomorrow.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.742
[Cliff] What's Drinky's deal?

17:51.776 --> 17:53.411
[Larry] Who? Rita?

17:53.443 --> 17:54.546
She was an actress.

17:54.579 --> 17:58.148
She prefers the light here
in the evening.

17:58.182 --> 18:00.483
Looking terrific today, Rita.

18:00.518 --> 18:01.719
[Rita] Hmm?

18:01.752 --> 18:04.154
[Cliff] Oh, fuck me.

18:04.189 --> 18:07.425
[Larry] Sometimes it helps
to picture a place
you'd like to go.

18:07.459 --> 18:11.229
[Cliff] How about
up the freakin' steps?

18:11.262 --> 18:14.632
[Larry] Why go up
the steps at all?

18:14.664 --> 18:16.601
[Cliff] I can't walk!

18:16.634 --> 18:19.069
I can't feel! I can't eat,

18:19.104 --> 18:21.740
I can't smell, can't shit.
I can't fuck

18:21.773 --> 18:24.142
and I'd like to be able to do
one fucking thing for myself

18:24.143 --> 18:26.076
when I kiss you and the other
fucking monster here

18:26.076 --> 18:27.612

18:27.644 --> 18:30.949
Hi, Daddy.

18:30.981 --> 18:32.849
[Niles] <i>Seeing your daughter,
that's good.</i>

18:32.884 --> 18:35.353
That means your memories
are coming back.

18:35.386 --> 18:38.355
Maybe she's just
the inspiration you need.

18:38.390 --> 18:40.557
[Cliff] Has anyone
ever left this place?

18:40.590 --> 18:41.992
[Niles] Some have.

18:42.026 --> 18:44.061
Some come and go.

18:44.095 --> 18:47.132
Others like Larry and Rita
prefer to stay.

18:47.164 --> 18:48.865
Rita has her knitting.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.236
Larry, his horticulture.

18:51.269 --> 18:54.740
But to be perfectly honest,
those who leave

18:54.772 --> 18:57.241
find it's often more difficult
for the world out there

18:57.275 --> 19:00.811
to accept who they've become
than they do.

19:00.845 --> 19:02.079
In better news,

19:02.113 --> 19:03.815
I can see no mechanical reason

19:03.847 --> 19:06.917
why you shouldn't
be able to walk.

19:06.951 --> 19:08.786
<i>Keep going, Cliff.</i>

19:08.819 --> 19:10.721

19:13.790 --> 19:16.460
Aren't you supposed to be
not walking?

19:16.493 --> 19:18.429
[Cliff] Yeah.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.698
And?

19:20.730 --> 19:23.667
I'm remembering.

19:23.701 --> 19:25.500
[Rita sighs]

19:29.507 --> 19:31.009
You used to do this?

19:31.041 --> 19:34.644
[Cliff] Yeah.

19:34.679 --> 19:37.914
Around and around. That's it?

19:37.949 --> 19:41.185
Yeah.

19:41.219 --> 19:44.669
You were in the movies?

19:46.523 --> 19:48.925

20:18.789 --> 20:22.690
"Whose horns will look..."

20:24.162 --> 20:27.499
Rita. Please. He's the best
focus puller in Africa.

20:27.531 --> 20:30.268
Ugh. He's an eyesore, Charles.
A real liability.

20:30.301 --> 20:31.935
What if we cover up the arm?

20:31.936 --> 20:33.769
-A different set of clothes.
-Get rid of him.

20:33.770 --> 20:35.906
But the crew, they adore him.

20:35.940 --> 20:40.589
So put his name
on the marquee.

20:49.554 --> 20:52.423
Now, Rita, you're gonna
step onto this gangplank here.

20:52.457 --> 20:54.159
The crocodile
will turn up there.

20:54.192 --> 20:55.859
You'll scream bloody murder.

20:55.893 --> 20:58.262
And Joe'll blast 'er to Betsy.

You think you can handle it?

21:03.134 --> 21:07.538
Of course.

It's fine.

You've never gone for a swim?

23:29.346 --> 23:33.696
[Clara echoing] <i>Daddy.</i>

23:35.153 --> 23:36.921
[Cliff] I used to hold

when she was learning to walk.

23:38.824 --> 23:41.492

to go up the steps.</i>

23:41.526 --> 23:43.961
<i>Always wanted to go up.</i>

23:43.994 --> 23:45.596
<i>Even after she could do it,</i>

23:45.630 --> 23:47.632
after I'd given her
the tools, you know,

23:47.665 --> 23:50.468
she'd just stand there
every time,

23:50.501 --> 23:53.837
wanting me to help her.

23:53.871 --> 23:56.540
And I would get so pissed.

23:56.575 --> 24:00.444
"Just walk up
the goddamn steps, okay?"

24:00.478 --> 24:05.478

the goddamn steps.

My family thinks
I died in a car crash
seven years ago.

25:28.398 --> 25:31.201
My daughter's probably
grown up without a father.

25:31.234 --> 25:33.505
My wife's probably moved on.

25:33.538 --> 25:35.840
But they deserve to know.

25:35.874 --> 25:39.210
And they can decide
what to do with it.

25:39.242 --> 25:41.311
Thank you
for everything you've done.

25:41.346 --> 25:43.681
But this...

25:43.713 --> 25:46.785
isn't me.

I'm thrilled beyond belief
for you, that you're walking,

25:51.221 --> 25:54.592
that you finally
feel like you.

25:54.625 --> 25:58.395
All I wanted was to give you

It's the phone message I used
to recreate your voice.

30:12.784 --> 30:15.385
where I hit, what I hit,

30:15.420 --> 30:19.624
I can't feel pain.

30:19.656 --> 30:24.606
That's mighty shitty
of you, Doc.

30:42.413 --> 30:45.983
[Morden] <i>And the years passed.</i>

30:46.017 --> 30:51.017
<i>And it's all so depressing.
I just can't.</i>

31:33.265 --> 31:36.066
That's a new building
next to the police station.

31:36.099 --> 31:37.335
What's it say?

31:37.367 --> 31:38.435
[Cliff] Library.

31:38.469 --> 31:40.704
Your handwriting
is an abomination.

31:40.738 --> 31:43.775
[Cliff] Robot fingers.
[Rita] Mmm-hmm.

31:43.807 --> 31:46.111
[girl] Daddy, I'm home!

31:46.111 --> 31:47.577
[girl continues
talking indistinctly]

31:47.612 --> 31:49.114
Oh, goodie. She's back.

31:49.146 --> 31:51.248
-[Larry] Rita.
-Comes and goes as she pleases,

31:51.281 --> 31:53.317
like she owns the place.

31:53.351 --> 31:54.352
[Cliff] Who?

31:54.384 --> 31:56.221
[Morden] <i>Who indeed.</i>

31:56.253 --> 31:59.657
<i>Meet Jane. Some people
call her Crazy Jane.</i>

31:59.692 --> 32:02.492
<i>Sixty-four personas,
each with its own special power.</i>

32:02.527 --> 32:04.695
[Jane] Ha-ha!

32:04.729 --> 32:06.763
[Morden] <i>For example,
here comes Silvia.</i>

32:06.798 --> 32:08.465
<i>Spooky voice, a bit moody.</i>

32:08.499 --> 32:11.268
[in spooky voice]
I'm not sleepy.

32:11.301 --> 32:12.903
I want to speak to Jane.

32:12.936 --> 32:15.105
[Morden] <i>And watch now.
Here comes Hammerhead.</i>

32:15.140 --> 32:16.375
This one's kind of an asshole.

32:16.407 --> 32:21.345
Except Jane's not here,
you sissy little bitch.

32:21.378 --> 32:22.779
[Cliff] She's in a mood.

32:22.814 --> 32:25.281
[Larry] Which one of her
is in a mood?

32:25.316 --> 32:27.919
What the fuck?

32:27.951 --> 32:31.955
-Is that...
-Hammerhead, this is Cliff.

32:31.990 --> 32:34.692
[Hammerhead scoffs]

32:34.726 --> 32:35.859
Is he a toy?

32:35.894 --> 32:38.762
Hammerhead!

32:38.796 --> 32:40.298
-Are you a toy?
-[Cliff] Yeah.

32:40.332 --> 32:42.299
Heard you the first time.
Are you a raving douche?

32:42.299 --> 32:44.701
Hello, Hammerhead.
Good to see you.

32:44.736 --> 32:48.185
Fuck off and die, Rita.

32:51.709 --> 32:54.878
-[sighs]
-[Hammerhead] Ooh.

32:54.913 --> 32:57.181
This your pad, big guy?

32:57.213 --> 32:58.916
[chuckles]

32:58.950 --> 33:00.550
Your man cave?

33:00.585 --> 33:02.653
Where the magic happens?

33:02.686 --> 33:05.957
Come on. Show me what you got.

33:05.990 --> 33:09.492
What kind of man stuff
you got in here?

33:09.527 --> 33:11.477
[Cliff] Cars.

33:18.603 --> 33:21.638
Yeah.

33:21.673 --> 33:25.176
Little toy cars
for a little toy man.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.945
I bet it gets
real wild in there. [laughs]

33:27.979 --> 33:29.681
In the wee-wee hours
of the night,

33:29.713 --> 33:31.349
when you think
no one's watching...

33:31.383 --> 33:35.118
[Cliff] Anyone ever tell you
to shut your fucking hole?

33:35.152 --> 33:36.153
Or what?

33:36.186 --> 33:37.821
[clangs]

33:37.855 --> 33:41.455
Little toybot does what?

33:54.404 --> 33:57.855
[footsteps approaching]

34:02.512 --> 34:04.848
Jane.

34:04.883 --> 34:06.917
Cliff.

34:06.951 --> 34:09.653
The Robotman.

34:09.686 --> 34:12.356
Hammerhead told me you met.

34:12.391 --> 34:16.728
[Cliff] She tell you
she grabbed my junk?

34:16.760 --> 34:19.364
Hammerhead doesn't
kiss and tell.

34:19.398 --> 34:22.000
[Cliff] How long you been
busting the Chief's balls?

34:22.032 --> 34:24.268
Long before you got here.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.838
Seven days.

34:26.871 --> 34:29.340
You know how it is
when you meet the Chief.

34:29.373 --> 34:33.210
Best day of my life.

34:33.244 --> 34:36.914
[Cliff] It wasn't all
Hammerhead's fault last night.

34:36.947 --> 34:39.516
Next week's
my daughter's birthday.

34:39.550 --> 34:42.420
Pretty much the 30th year

34:42.454 --> 34:45.590
straight that I haven't
been with her.

34:45.623 --> 34:50.027
I'm a little on edge, I guess.

34:50.061 --> 34:51.795
[Morden] <i>And so it was.</i>

34:51.829 --> 34:53.898
After a brief misunderstanding

34:53.931 --> 34:56.634
<i>in which junk was grabbed,</i>

34:56.666 --> 34:58.469
<i>Robotman met Jane.</i>

34:58.503 --> 35:02.773
<i>And all was right
and all was good.</i>

35:02.806 --> 35:05.175
<i>For now.</i>

35:05.210 --> 35:07.811
[Cliff] It's getting dark.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.112
Jane?

35:09.146 --> 35:10.514
No.

35:10.547 --> 35:12.916
I'm the Hangman's Daughter.

35:12.951 --> 35:15.454
[Cliff] Okay.

35:15.487 --> 35:17.521
Do you rember
what it felt like?

35:17.554 --> 35:19.923
What?

35:19.958 --> 35:21.726
To be normal.

35:21.759 --> 35:24.896
Like them.

35:24.929 --> 35:29.333
Sometimes I try to rember.

35:29.367 --> 35:33.670
Sometimes I hope
I still will be.

35:33.704 --> 35:38.704
I don't even know
what to hope for.

35:41.746 --> 35:45.516
My painting's ruined.

35:45.548 --> 35:49.148
Everything's gone wrong.

35:50.822 --> 35:53.358
[Cliff] Come in
out of the rain.

35:53.391 --> 35:55.293
<i>-Why don't you get back here?
-Why should I?</i>

35:55.327 --> 35:57.195
<i>All you ever do
is talk about the war.</i>

35:57.228 --> 36:01.699
[Morden] <i>And life
in Dumb Manor
proceeded accordingly.</i>

36:01.733 --> 36:04.034
<i>So much so,
the Chief felt
comfortable enough</i>

36:04.068 --> 36:05.637
<i>to resume his
occasional travels.</i>

36:05.670 --> 36:06.871
[woman on TV]
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

36:06.903 --> 36:08.206
I won't be gone long.

36:08.239 --> 36:10.175
[all] But there are mysterious
things in this world

36:10.175 --> 36:11.842
that bear keeping an eye on.

36:11.876 --> 36:15.813
So go, I must.

36:15.847 --> 36:18.449
[sighs] So, we
understand each other.

36:18.481 --> 36:19.750
Bring a condom.

36:19.784 --> 36:21.952
And you, behave.

36:21.985 --> 36:23.887
I'll be back in a few days.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.956
[Cliff] Bye, Dad.

36:24.989 --> 36:29.989
[TV continues
playing indistinctly]

36:36.934 --> 36:38.869
[Morden]
<i>Indifferent as they seemed,</i>

36:38.902 --> 36:41.106
<i>it did occur to each
and every one,</i>

36:41.139 --> 36:43.541
<i>it had been a long
time since all four</i>

36:43.574 --> 36:46.110
<i>were in the house
without Dear Father.</i>

36:46.143 --> 36:49.547
<i>Why, they could do anything.
[chuckles evilly]</i>

36:49.579 --> 36:52.516
<i>Anything at all.</i>

36:52.550 --> 36:55.518
<i>Groan.</i>

36:55.552 --> 36:59.023
<i>Ugh.</i>

36:59.056 --> 37:00.190
<i>Wait.</i>

37:00.224 --> 37:01.726
[Jane] Honk, honk.

37:01.759 --> 37:04.608
[Morden] <i>Oh?</i>

37:06.864 --> 37:09.266
[Larry] Is that my bus?

37:09.300 --> 37:11.302
[Rita] What on earth
are you doing?

37:11.335 --> 37:12.936
[Jane] What are we doing?

37:12.971 --> 37:14.438
We're going into town.

37:14.472 --> 37:18.041
After the Chief explicitly
asked us not to.

37:18.076 --> 37:20.010
This is your most reckless
scheme yet, Jane.

37:20.043 --> 37:23.780
Crazy Jane.

37:23.815 --> 37:24.815
[Cliff] I'm in.

37:24.849 --> 37:26.550
Shocking.

37:26.583 --> 37:28.219
[Jane] Larry?

37:28.219 --> 37:29.688
[Larry] Um, does it
matter to any of you

37:29.688 --> 37:34.688
that the Chief thinks
we're not ready?

37:34.791 --> 37:38.295
No.

37:38.329 --> 37:40.797
-[Jane] Rita?
-Don't be ridiculous.

37:40.831 --> 37:42.199
Oh, come on.

37:42.233 --> 37:45.269
There's a whole world
out there waiting to be seen.

37:45.302 --> 37:47.972
That hasn't seen
you in 60 years.

37:48.005 --> 37:49.239
I see what you're doing.

37:49.273 --> 37:50.807
Playing my ego.

37:50.842 --> 37:52.976
I won't be played.

37:53.010 --> 37:54.811
Okay.

37:54.846 --> 37:58.081
Happy knitting.

37:58.115 --> 38:01.353
[exhales]

38:01.385 --> 38:05.822
-Larry.
-[Larry] Don't.

38:05.856 --> 38:06.923
[Rita] Larry.

38:06.958 --> 38:08.907
[Larry sighs]

38:37.954 --> 38:40.925
[indistinct chatter]

38:40.958 --> 38:43.126
Don't say a word.

38:43.161 --> 38:45.128
You look nice.

38:45.163 --> 38:50.034
Of course I do.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.168
Don't wait up.

38:59.177 --> 39:03.827
Which one of you
has any money?

39:04.449 --> 39:06.684
[music playing on speakers]

39:06.717 --> 39:09.717
[indistinct chatter]

39:14.925 --> 39:18.295
Be with you in a second, hon.

39:18.329 --> 39:23.329
[oldies music
playing over speakers]

39:27.771 --> 39:30.775
[indistinct chatter]

39:30.807 --> 39:33.210
-You okay?
-All good.

39:33.244 --> 39:35.193
Almost there.

39:41.918 --> 39:45.155
I don't get it.

39:45.188 --> 39:50.188
You said it was
your daughter's birthday.

39:58.737 --> 39:59.737
Oh.

39:59.737 --> 40:02.306
There is nothing,
nothing like a malted.

40:02.340 --> 40:04.007
Am I right?

40:04.041 --> 40:05.210
You know, this is crazy.

40:05.242 --> 40:08.512
You even talk like her,
you know that?

40:08.545 --> 40:09.547
Who?

40:09.547 --> 40:10.447
Rita Farr.

40:10.447 --> 40:14.485
Actress from the '50s.

40:14.518 --> 40:18.088
My dad made me
watch all her movies.

40:18.121 --> 40:19.523
Made you?

40:19.557 --> 40:21.525
She must have been the only
actress that I was ever, like,

40:21.525 --> 40:23.327
"You know what?
I could hang with her."

40:23.360 --> 40:26.164
I mean, she was cool and sexy,

40:26.197 --> 40:27.498
but a broad, too.

40:27.532 --> 40:29.668
I mean,
<i>Three Guns To Santa Fe?</i>

40:29.701 --> 40:32.836
El Paso.
<i>Three Guns To El Paso.</i>

40:32.869 --> 40:34.838
Okay, so you do know her.

40:34.871 --> 40:35.873
I don't know.

40:35.907 --> 40:37.041
Mostly, I loved her,

40:37.076 --> 40:39.476
'cause it meant I get to
spend extra time with my dad.

40:39.510 --> 40:41.079
It was a tough time
in our lives,

40:41.112 --> 40:45.083
but Rita Farr,
she got us through.

40:45.115 --> 40:46.184
Sit.

40:46.217 --> 40:48.853
Tell me.

40:48.885 --> 40:49.887
About my dad?

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
No.

40:57.762 --> 40:59.063
[indistinct chatter]

40:59.097 --> 41:01.465
[Larry exhales]

41:01.498 --> 41:02.833
[Clara's laugh echoing]

41:02.867 --> 41:05.969
[Cliff] One day a year,
I had one job.

41:06.003 --> 41:07.539
Buy the present.

41:07.572 --> 41:09.507
It was my favorite day.

41:09.541 --> 41:11.876
The accident was a few days
before her birthday,

41:11.909 --> 41:15.913
and I was so angry by then,

41:15.947 --> 41:18.916
at myself, my wife,

41:18.951 --> 41:21.820
I couldn't see past my own
bullshit, and then I forgot.

41:21.853 --> 41:24.389
You forgot to buy your
daughter a birthday present?

41:24.422 --> 41:25.889
[Cliff] I was busy.

41:25.922 --> 41:26.990
Fucking the nanny.

41:27.023 --> 41:28.559
You idiot.

41:28.592 --> 41:31.228
Yeah.

41:31.262 --> 41:36.262
And now I'm totally
stressed. [sighs]

41:36.699 --> 41:40.338
[lighter clicks]

41:40.371 --> 41:42.039
[Cliff chuckling] Oh! Oh, God.

41:42.072 --> 41:43.608
I would so fuck that joint up.

41:43.641 --> 41:48.141
Except it's mine, so fuck off.

41:57.755 --> 41:59.789
Anything?

41:59.824 --> 42:03.594
[sighs]

42:03.628 --> 42:07.378
[indie rock song playing]

42:15.373 --> 42:17.773
[balls clacking]

42:32.556 --> 42:36.927
[Larry] Pardon me.

42:36.961 --> 42:41.231
Would you mind
if I ordered a drink?

42:41.264 --> 42:45.436
What'll it be?

42:45.469 --> 42:48.769
[Larry] I want a beer.

42:53.545 --> 42:56.514
And then there was
that African picture.

42:56.547 --> 42:57.947
<i>Forbidden Congo.</i>

42:57.981 --> 42:59.250
Forbidden dookie.

42:59.282 --> 43:00.885
Oh, come on.

43:00.918 --> 43:02.253
I heard she fell ill.

43:02.286 --> 43:04.021
They replaced her mid-picture.

43:04.054 --> 43:05.657
-She was a drunk.
-No.

43:05.690 --> 43:07.992
And then, there was
that whole porn thing.

43:08.025 --> 43:10.594
The what?

43:10.628 --> 43:11.929
[whispers] Rita Farr?

43:11.963 --> 43:16.400
Oh, trust me. My dad had
duffel bags full of the stuff.

43:16.434 --> 43:20.003
Your father said Rita Farr
was doing porn?

43:20.036 --> 43:21.237
Full on.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.280
[Cliff] How pissed
do you think the Chief would be

43:29.313 --> 43:31.882
knowing we were out here
being gawked at?

43:31.916 --> 43:33.318
[Jane sighs]

43:33.351 --> 43:35.619
I honestly don't give a fuck.

43:35.653 --> 43:37.755
Nope. Not buying it.

43:37.788 --> 43:38.788
What?

43:38.789 --> 43:41.025
I think you care a lot
about what he thinks.

43:41.057 --> 43:42.427
You don't know me.

43:42.460 --> 43:44.429
You need him
like the rest of us do.

43:44.461 --> 43:46.164
Hey, I hate to say it,
but I need him,

43:46.164 --> 43:48.065
to get my life back,
or whatever that looks like.

43:48.065 --> 43:50.335
If you want your life back,
why don't you just call her?

43:50.335 --> 43:51.969
Who?

43:52.003 --> 43:53.637
Your daughter.

-According to?
-My daughter's dead.

43:59.177 --> 44:00.311
Oh.

44:00.344 --> 44:01.878
Because you can confirm that?

44:01.911 --> 44:03.949
Multiple sources?

44:03.981 --> 44:07.050
It's all over
the Internet, man!

44:07.083 --> 44:08.552
Your shitty driving.

44:08.585 --> 44:10.554
Wife, Kate, decapitated.

44:10.588 --> 44:12.590
Daughter, Clara,
sole survivor.

44:12.623 --> 44:13.925
Shut up, Jane.

44:13.958 --> 44:17.295
There are three Clara Steeles
in the United States.

44:17.327 --> 44:19.463
My daughter's dead.

44:19.496 --> 44:20.764
Let's find out.

44:20.797 --> 44:24.802
No!

they were staring at him,</i>

44:29.373 --> 44:30.909

44:30.942 --> 44:33.811
<i>but not for reasons
one might think.</i>

44:33.844 --> 44:37.514
<i>The truth is, Larry Trainor
had felt like a monster</i>

45:05.543 --> 45:07.512
Get a medic!

45:07.545 --> 45:11.516
Larry.

45:11.548 --> 45:13.184
[Morden]
<i>And the sadder truth was,</i>

45:13.217 --> 45:17.422
<i>he'd finally become
what he had once
felt like only inside.</i>

45:17.454 --> 45:20.257
[electricity buzzing softly]

45:20.291 --> 45:23.527
[Larry] No.

45:23.561 --> 45:25.295
[waitress] Sure you don't
want any dessert?

45:25.329 --> 45:26.896
Just the check, please.

[groaning]

45:31.902 --> 45:33.371
Hey!

45:33.403 --> 45:34.938
Is there a problem, ma'am?

45:34.972 --> 45:35.972
No, officer.

45:35.974 --> 45:39.143
The only problem
I see is you, pig.

45:39.175 --> 45:42.079
[Cliff] Oh, here we go.

45:42.112 --> 45:43.782
[Larry] No. Not now.

45:43.815 --> 45:46.550
[Cliff] Officers,
my friend here is
maybe a little depressed,

45:46.583 --> 45:48.152
maybe a little high.

45:48.152 --> 45:49.219
But she takes it all back.

45:49.219 --> 45:50.588
Take it back, Hammerhead.

45:50.623 --> 45:54.525
Which one of you motherfuckers
wants me to jerk
a knot in your ass?

45:54.559 --> 45:56.958
[Cliff] Fuck me.

47:46.637 --> 47:48.338
What do we do? What do we do?
What do we do?

47:48.338 --> 47:49.440
Get back. Get back.

described as a "robot man"

49:28.940 --> 49:31.242
I begged you.

You have no idea

[Niles] Whether
you realize it or not,

50:14.918 --> 50:16.586
your actions...

50:16.621 --> 50:19.190
Your actions
have consequences,

50:19.224 --> 50:23.894
and those consequences
are coming to this house,

50:23.927 --> 50:26.231
to the town.

50:26.264 --> 50:28.733
[sighs] Of that,
there's no doubt.

50:28.766 --> 50:30.702
You really think
we're in danger, Chief?

50:30.735 --> 50:32.036
That we need
to pick up and run?

50:32.070 --> 50:33.771
That's what you
really, really think?

50:33.804 --> 50:36.007
As far away as possible,

50:36.041 --> 50:37.342
as soon as we can.

50:37.376 --> 50:39.210
[Cliff] What happens
to the town?

50:39.244 --> 50:41.612
The town is not
my main concern.

50:41.612 --> 50:42.813
[Cliff] So, the town
gets screwed?

50:42.847 --> 50:46.250
You've done quite
enough to this town,

50:46.282 --> 50:47.719
thank you.

50:47.751 --> 50:48.987
This is bullshit.

50:49.019 --> 50:50.454
[Niles] Don't you
start with me.

50:50.487 --> 50:51.724
You and I both know

50:51.757 --> 50:54.858
this field trip was for little
more than your own amusement.

50:54.893 --> 50:56.728
[Cliff] So, now
she's the bad guy?

50:56.760 --> 50:59.998
Okay, let's talk
about you, Chief.

51:00.030 --> 51:03.701
You told me
my daughter was dead!

51:03.735 --> 51:05.570
I was trying to protect you.

51:05.603 --> 51:06.938
[Cliff] By lying?

51:06.971 --> 51:10.242
I'm trying to protect you now.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.309
Do you honestly think
she would have accepted you?

51:12.344 --> 51:13.978
[Cliff] Did I get
a chance to try?

51:14.012 --> 51:15.980
She lost her mother,
her father.

51:16.014 --> 51:17.882
I don't know if she
would have accepted me.

51:17.916 --> 51:21.085
You robbed me of that chance.

51:21.119 --> 51:24.255
What am I to her now?

51:24.288 --> 51:25.757
I'm nothing.

51:25.789 --> 51:27.693
I'm a monster.

51:27.726 --> 51:31.394
I assure you, there are many
monsters in this world,

51:31.429 --> 51:34.099
and none of them,

51:34.132 --> 51:36.831
not a one, is you.

51:41.672 --> 51:45.242
I've tried so hard
to shield you.

51:45.277 --> 51:47.911
And I know
what I'm asking you.

51:47.945 --> 51:51.115
To leave the safest place
you've ever known,

51:51.148 --> 51:54.918
to step out into the world
that would rather ignore you,

51:54.952 --> 51:56.519
shun you,

51:56.554 --> 51:58.822
belittle you.

51:58.856 --> 52:00.891
But if you stay here,

52:00.925 --> 52:02.226
if we die now,

52:02.260 --> 52:06.931
then this magical experiment,

52:06.965 --> 52:11.034
this you,

52:11.068 --> 52:13.670
my life accomplishments,

52:13.704 --> 52:15.039
all,

52:15.072 --> 52:19.643
it will just...

52:19.677 --> 52:21.177
It will...

52:25.215 --> 52:27.117
[Cliff] Or we don't
abandon the town.

52:27.152 --> 52:29.853
We protect them from
these so-called enemies.

52:29.887 --> 52:31.255
We fight.

52:31.288 --> 52:33.423
We could.

52:33.456 --> 52:34.992
But we'd be doomed.

52:35.025 --> 52:38.626
[Cliff] What are we now?

52:40.632 --> 52:44.335
[Larry] I'm going to go
with the Chief.

52:44.367 --> 52:45.418
Agreed.

52:53.945 --> 52:56.413
[sighs] Fuck it.

52:56.447 --> 52:57.646
Shotgun.

53:05.123 --> 53:06.922
[Niles] Hmm.

53:39.856 --> 53:41.226
Hey, for the record,

53:41.259 --> 53:43.128
the town can kiss my ass.

53:43.128 --> 53:45.262
But that doesn't mean Cliff
should go in there alone.

53:45.297 --> 53:47.197
It's over, Jane. Let it go.

53:47.231 --> 53:49.500
Okay, except I vote
we turn around.

53:49.532 --> 53:51.335
-No.
-Rita?

53:51.369 --> 53:55.873
I can't promise I won't,
you know, be disgusting.

53:55.907 --> 53:57.175
But, yes.

53:57.208 --> 53:58.943
[Larry sighs]

53:58.976 --> 54:00.978
Larry?

54:01.012 --> 54:02.278
Larry's a yes.

54:02.313 --> 54:03.313
Whoo!

54:38.115 --> 54:39.916
This is wrong.

54:39.951 --> 54:41.853
Might be.

54:41.885 --> 54:44.889
Probably is.

54:44.922 --> 54:47.021
We'll be back.

55:28.166 --> 55:29.434
[Morden] <i>And there they go,</i>

55:53.056 --> 55:54.759
[Morden] Yes, Niles.

Paraguay.

55:56.659 --> 56:00.563
Always, Paraguay.

56:00.597 --> 56:01.865
Morden.

56:01.898 --> 56:03.034
Sure.

56:03.067 --> 56:04.335
But not.

56:04.369 --> 56:07.170
I mean, I haven't been
Mr. Morden since... [groans]

56:07.204 --> 56:10.240
No! Help me. [chuckles]

56:10.275 --> 56:11.925
[hoofbeats]

56:21.786 --> 56:23.135
[farting]

56:40.771 --> 56:43.708
I've been admiring
your friends, Niles,

56:43.742 --> 56:46.311
those freaks of yours
for quite some time.

56:46.344 --> 56:48.313
Don't you dare hurt them.

56:48.346 --> 56:50.014
Hurt them? No.

56:50.047 --> 56:51.349
That wouldn't be any fun.

56:51.382 --> 56:52.684
No. [laughing]

56:52.717 --> 56:54.485
That would be quite the same
old story, wouldn't it?

56:54.518 --> 56:59.423
I think we're gonna do
something different this time.

56:59.456 --> 57:03.460
You were right in
one respect, however.

57:03.494 --> 57:05.128
They are quite doomed.

57:05.163 --> 57:06.463
[Cliff] What the fuck?
