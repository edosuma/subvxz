WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:01.995
Scott Arthur Minett,

00:02.029 --> 00:04.875
former soldier who served honourably
in Afghanistan,

00:04.910 --> 00:07.035
now leading People's Justice
in the Red Zone.

00:07.070 --> 00:10.275
Here we are, Mr Prime Minister!
You'd better be listening now.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.635
For better or worse,
Mr Nobody speaks for a lot of people.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.476
I am not inviting him to Downing Street.

00:14.512 --> 00:15.432
Chequers then.

00:15.468 --> 00:16.911
Ellie's not coping well.

00:16.947 --> 00:19.715
We will get her through this
if we just hold the line.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.075
The law must take its course unimpeded.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.595
I have never interfered with that

00:24.630 --> 00:27.995
and I would never instruct
any of my staff to do so.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.951
Why did he come back to
find you after so long?

00:29.987 --> 00:30.955
I don't know.

00:30.990 --> 00:35.755
Edin Tosumbegovic is connected to a
Balkan gangster called Toni Lulin.

00:35.790 --> 00:37.707
- Do you love him?
- I don't know.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.595
The capital has
effectively been encircled

00:40.630 --> 00:44.411
and our attempts to move a new
transformer to the Red Zone paralysed.

00:44.555 --> 00:47.056
You need to get the tankers
out of the depots,

00:47.092 --> 00:48.875
which might not be so easy

00:48.910 --> 00:51.795
if my members decide
to take matters further.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.490
It's not us who's under pressure
here, Prime Minister.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.108
Georgia was my best friend.

01:02.990 --> 01:06.675
I loved her. She did not deserve
what happened to her

01:06.710 --> 01:09.315
and she doesn't deserve
to be blamed for it now.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.939
I'm sorry that I've added to
the suffering of her family.

01:14.510 --> 01:16.510
I admit that it was all my fault.

01:18.230 --> 01:20.750
I'm the one that provided the drugs
and I lied.

01:22.070 --> 01:24.412
Not because of my privilege
but because I'm...

01:25.150 --> 01:27.110
scared about going to prison.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.469
She was scared she might go to prison.

01:34.150 --> 01:36.190
Were you scared, Mrs Sutherland?

01:37.110 --> 01:38.655
You'll have to be more specific.

01:40.323 --> 01:42.470
When you discovered
Ellie had supplied the drugs,

01:43.101 --> 01:44.930
were you scared she might go to prison?

01:45.106 --> 01:46.055
Come on, detective,

01:46.091 --> 01:48.605
you'll have to do better than "when
did you stop beating your wife?"

01:48.749 --> 01:52.949
You didn't advise her to lie in
police interviews and put the blame

01:54.390 --> 01:57.727
Are you asking me did I conspire
to pervert the course of justice?

01:58.510 --> 02:00.515
No, I did not. Did anybody else?

02:00.550 --> 02:01.827
Not to my knowledge.

02:02.401 --> 02:04.550
Did you ever discuss it with Peter Mott?

02:06.010 --> 02:07.060
With who?

02:07.296 --> 02:10.145
You don't know the name of
your husband's press secretary?

02:11.030 --> 02:12.595
Yes, of course I know who he is.

02:13.229 --> 02:16.028
Did you ever discuss Ellie's
predicament with Peter Mott?

02:18.630 --> 02:20.366
I think there might have...

02:21.808 --> 02:23.275
There may have been a conversation

02:23.310 --> 02:26.315
about the level of tabloid interest
a case like this would attract.

02:26.350 --> 02:30.392
So you discussed
protecting your daughter

02:30.830 --> 02:32.361
from press intrusion.

02:33.315 --> 02:35.160
We've often had to do that.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.282
I'm sure.

02:40.150 --> 02:45.715
Look, my daughter has admitted to
an understandable error of judgement

02:45.750 --> 02:49.148
because she is overcome
with pain and grief

02:49.184 --> 02:50.555
over her best friend's death.

02:50.590 --> 02:52.529
You now have to decide
whether to charge or not.

02:52.565 --> 02:53.754
She's fully prepared for that.

02:54.071 --> 02:56.475
But, in the meantime,
I'd like to go home and be with her

02:56.510 --> 02:58.872
because, believe it or not,
for all her supposed privilege,

03:00.590 --> 03:01.744
right now Ellie...

03:02.670 --> 03:05.710
She's just a very, very frightened
young woman.

03:07.070 --> 03:08.158
And she needs her mum.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.253
OK. Fine. That'll do.

03:13.470 --> 03:14.464
For now.

03:21.641 --> 03:24.641
Sync & corrections by emeline-whovian
www.addic7ed.com

03:27.644 --> 03:29.642
I'll travel to Chequers by helicopter.

03:29.816 --> 03:31.915
I can't run the risk of getting
trapped at a blockade.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.198
A special train to Aylesbury
has also been laid on

03:34.234 --> 03:35.395
and there are cars from there.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.023
Trains? Good God.

03:37.059 --> 03:39.995
We may as well hold this
in the waiting room at Paddington.

03:40.030 --> 03:42.288
We have to show we're
not besieged in the capital,

03:42.324 --> 03:43.915
that we can travel anywhere.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.207
What's happening in the Red Zone?

03:45.990 --> 03:48.571
Well, we've set up a new
Gold Command Centre

03:48.607 --> 03:49.915
at the airbase near Hexham.

03:50.252 --> 03:53.275
From now on only essential supplies
go to the hospital

03:53.310 --> 03:56.235
and we've arranged buses to move
those who want to leave.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.951
What a waste of time and resources.

03:58.168 --> 04:01.255
I think People's Justice know
the action is somewhere else now.

04:01.753 --> 04:03.904
They've still got their foot
on our throat.

04:04.550 --> 04:07.555
Panic buying has increased
in a lot of areas.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.471
There are big issues over fuel supply

04:09.507 --> 04:11.675
now that the Dartford Tunnel is blocked.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.595
Also enormous problems with bloods
and special medical couriers.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.774
I seem to remember a time
when you dismissed such issues

04:18.810 --> 04:20.293
as minor logistics.

04:20.776 --> 04:23.230
Don't underestimate Scott Minett.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.310
He's got a massive profile now

04:25.346 --> 04:27.034
and he'll take that with him
to the barricades.

04:27.070 --> 04:30.435
Surely his car comes off the road
somewhere on the A40?

04:30.832 --> 04:35.072
What good's the deep state if it can't
organise a simple assassination?

04:35.990 --> 04:39.035
The only deep state I'm familiar
with is my inbox.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.686
OK, let me be absolutely clear.
I will meet with these people.

04:43.365 --> 04:44.976
But if they push too hard,

04:45.378 --> 04:48.218
I will drive them straight
off my fucking mountain.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.074

04:57.510 --> 04:58.590
Yes.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.510
OK. Yeah, yeah, keep me updated, yeah.

05:07.310 --> 05:08.689
Peter Mott's been arrested.

05:09.579 --> 05:11.715
Searched his office, taken his
computers.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.350
This is a full-blown witch hunt now,
isn't it?

05:17.252 --> 05:19.052
I lied to Parliament, Rachel.

05:20.007 --> 05:21.831
They'll keep on and on
trying to prove that.

05:21.867 --> 05:22.907
They can't prove it.

05:22.943 --> 05:25.276
They can say it, some people might
believe it, but they can't prove it.

05:25.510 --> 05:27.436
And let's be honest.
These are different times.

05:27.472 --> 05:30.160
The bar for misdemeanours is
way higher than it used to be.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.889
Well, thank God for our degraded
sense of political honour.

05:34.136 --> 05:38.355
There is nothing degraded about
wanting to protect your family, Robert.

05:38.390 --> 05:41.224
Whatever it takes, family first. Always.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.260
What?

05:43.169 --> 05:45.369
That's what Scott Minett says too.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.430
I guess we're all the same in the end.

05:49.699 --> 05:51.023
Bunch of selfish apes.

05:53.590 --> 05:56.110
Oh, sweetheart, don't get cynical.

05:57.070 --> 05:58.570
It's not you at all.

06:31.130 --> 06:33.930
I have a visual on lover boy
with an unknown female.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.658
"Dear Diary,

06:49.251 --> 06:53.391
busy morning lusting after Amy Williams
from The Mail on Sunday

06:53.427 --> 06:56.487
followed by a spot
of coaching Ellie Sutherland

06:56.523 --> 06:59.243
on how best to lie to the police."

07:02.830 --> 07:05.875
- Oh, he hasn't?
- It's on his computer.

07:06.413 --> 07:07.870
They're still going through it.

07:09.044 --> 07:11.955
They're not questioning him
till later, which is frustrating.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.866
A slight delay will probably help,

07:14.511 --> 07:16.675
given that all the attention
will be on Chequers.

07:16.710 --> 07:17.984
What about Anna Marshall?

07:18.088 --> 07:20.057
- Sleeping with the enemy?
- In hand.

07:20.093 --> 07:22.338
- So...
- My hands.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.000
You bugging the flat?

07:24.904 --> 07:26.439
No comment.

07:28.190 --> 07:31.309
- Does she know you're bugging the flat?
- Archie...

07:31.345 --> 07:34.971
Let me know if they pick up
anything particularly salacious.

07:35.007 --> 07:37.100
I'll only share it
with my WhatsApp group.

07:37.136 --> 07:38.994
Piss off, Archie,
you'll be late for Chequers.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.849
Nothing can move down there.

07:53.490 --> 07:55.110
We have to end this.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.471
One way or another.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.793
Looks like we're staying put until
we know the outcome from Chequers.

08:05.163 --> 08:06.939
But they're not going
to agree on anything.

08:07.039 --> 08:08.944
It's obvious the plan is
to bring down the government.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.981
Maybe, but the PM's in a fighting
mood so we'll see.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.447
Well, at least this means you can
go to your dad's funeral.

08:14.626 --> 08:17.954
Obviously I'll be
reachable on the mobile.

08:18.245 --> 08:19.995
- Are you gonna take Mabel?
- Sorry?

08:20.798 --> 08:22.225
You know, you said you
were worried about going...

08:22.261 --> 08:25.233
Oh, er, Francine Bridge
is coming along actually.

08:25.350 --> 08:27.100
Francine Bridge from the Policy Unit?

08:27.510 --> 08:29.210
- That's right.
- Ah.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.434
- Just, you know, bit of moral support.
- Mm.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.475
Now, where is the chief engineer?

08:34.861 --> 08:38.029
I need to speak to him about these
elevated stretches of roadway.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.216
He's slipping the move
on Francine Bridge?

08:42.251 --> 08:43.315
Wow.

08:43.350 --> 08:46.234
Good for you, Fraser, she is hot.
Aim high, dude.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.910
Yes.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.010
_

09:17.590 --> 09:21.470
Don't lose your focus now.
The government are on the ropes.

09:22.192 --> 09:25.317
I'm going down to Chequers
with the lorry drivers today

09:25.353 --> 09:26.902
and I'm going to deliver our message.

09:28.561 --> 09:30.214
Soon there'll be a new government.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.983
They're trying to starve
wor out of this building

09:38.425 --> 09:40.408
but the struggle has already moved on.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.235
We'll take the last of that fuel

09:43.270 --> 09:45.355
and get down to the barricades in London

09:45.391 --> 09:47.185
cos that's where this is gonna finish.

09:48.470 --> 09:51.870
But I'm telling yous, I promise yous...

09:52.710 --> 09:55.474
that in the years to come,
people are gonna look back on us,

09:55.510 --> 09:58.515
marching down them stairs
and taking this room.

09:59.283 --> 10:01.075
And they're gonna
remember us as the match

10:01.110 --> 10:03.790
that lit the flame
of the people's uprising.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.980
Hi, Mabel. Good dog.

10:20.630 --> 10:23.029
- Hey, Holly.
- Hey, Dad.

10:23.870 --> 10:26.995
- How are you?
- I came second in cross-country.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.479
Holly. Come back here, please.

10:30.099 --> 10:31.582
I love your shoes, Holly.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.690
Holly!

10:38.925 --> 10:40.925
_

10:50.201 --> 10:51.995
They only start listening
when it's London.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.608
If this had been the Southeast,
it would've been fixed in five minutes.

10:54.644 --> 10:55.641
Right.

10:55.677 --> 10:59.890
It's true.
Look, I'm not anti-London, right?

10:59.926 --> 11:02.057
In fact, I probably know
more real Londoners

11:02.093 --> 11:04.183
than any of the liberals
down there in their mansions.

11:04.470 --> 11:05.816
By real Londoners you mean...?

11:05.852 --> 11:08.573
I don't just mean white, if that's
what you're trying catch us out on.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.989
But you have to remember there are
still millions of white Londoners.

11:12.555 --> 11:14.967
That's the reality and
there's nowt wrong with it.

11:16.590 --> 11:18.668
Still plenty of fuel for
your generator, I see.

11:18.821 --> 11:21.826
You see that house there?
On the end with the flag on it?

11:22.072 --> 11:23.917
That's mad Thommo's house, right?

11:23.953 --> 11:26.793
Raging commie, knits socks for refugees.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.395
Across the street from him,
we've even got a couple of lesbians.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.791
What I'm saying is not
everybody thinks the same.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.363
It's not like yous lot make out.

11:35.744 --> 11:39.385
You keep saying this.
"They. You lot. The media".

11:39.421 --> 11:40.545
People who've got the power.

11:40.581 --> 11:42.715
- Get out the way.
- Ah, shut up!

11:42.751 --> 11:44.631
You see the thanks you get?

11:45.321 --> 11:47.970
People think they can tell us
what we're allowed to think,

11:48.006 --> 11:49.592
what we're allowed to say.

11:49.975 --> 11:53.875
Celebrities with their blue ticks
and their rainbow flags.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.424
As opposed to those salt-of-the-earth
types tying brown men to motorbikes?

11:57.832 --> 12:00.837
Look, man, some people are
completely racist, right?

12:00.873 --> 12:02.188
And some people are not.

12:02.637 --> 12:04.711
Most of wor are just
somewhere in the middle.

12:04.747 --> 12:06.012
Like you?

12:06.052 --> 12:09.155
Look, some lairy kid in an Audi
cuts us up, right?

12:09.190 --> 12:11.790
I might think to myself,
"Fuck you, Paki."

12:12.590 --> 12:13.825
No offence.

12:14.910 --> 12:16.366
I might even say it out loud.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.764
It depends who I'm with,
it depends what mood I'm in.

12:19.390 --> 12:22.574
So many people are, all over the
world, man, not just here.

12:23.990 --> 12:26.075
How would your parents
react if you told them,

12:26.110 --> 12:28.781
"Mam, Dad, I'm marrying a lass
from a different religion"?

12:29.811 --> 12:32.867
They'd throw a party if it was a
girl from any religion, I imagine.

12:40.255 --> 12:41.509
Do you think I am a racist?

12:43.439 --> 12:45.368
Lots of people have been asking me that.

12:45.404 --> 12:48.689
You know, when they're not
abusing me for normalising you.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.029
What do you tell them?

12:50.830 --> 12:52.293
Does it matter to you?

12:54.347 --> 12:55.990
I wouldn't be asking if it didn't.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.790
Well, I certainly think
you're pretty normal.

13:01.310 --> 13:03.157
Thank you.

13:04.234 --> 13:05.426
You're smart.

13:05.790 --> 13:08.155
Maybe in another era
the local headmaster

13:08.190 --> 13:11.430
would have come and pleaded with
your dad to let you stay on at school.

13:12.081 --> 13:14.801
Nah, he wanted us to stay on
at school, my old man.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.350
He was a deep thinker was John Minett.

13:20.310 --> 13:21.603
Union man, like.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.342
But, in the end, it doesn't matter
what I think of you personally

13:26.378 --> 13:27.905
any more than what you think of me.

13:29.004 --> 13:32.587
I'm just a journalist
and you're just my story.

13:34.289 --> 13:35.289
Aye.

13:36.910 --> 13:40.190
Howay then.
Come and see where your story lives.

13:41.590 --> 13:45.355
Now, don't mind the Hitler shrine,
right. And try not to touch my arse.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.377
I know it's tempting but
not in front of me daughter.

13:47.413 --> 13:49.192
There she is.

13:49.430 --> 13:50.697
Pride and joy.

13:52.110 --> 13:54.361
All right, darlin'.
Come and meet my new friend Manish.

13:59.550 --> 14:00.852
Bye, Mabel.

14:02.706 --> 14:03.966
Come on, Holly.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.355
Good luck.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.750
- What with?
- Him.

14:12.689 --> 14:13.934
We're colleagues.

14:14.890 --> 14:17.510
- If you say so.
- I do.

14:22.350 --> 14:25.630
Bye, Mabel. I love you, Mabel.
I'll miss you.

14:26.516 --> 14:28.010
Bye, love.

14:35.590 --> 14:37.710
- Right.
- Let's go for a drink.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.675
What I'll say to
the Prime Minister is simple.

14:42.710 --> 14:45.355
Call a general election.
Let the people decide.

14:45.390 --> 14:48.915
Do you feel any responsibility
towards people not having operations

14:48.950 --> 14:50.804
because there is a shortage
of blood in the capital?

14:50.840 --> 14:51.755
Hang on. Hang on.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.304
The responsibility for this lies
entirely with a government

14:54.340 --> 14:56.824
who has always ruled
on behalf of an elite

14:56.860 --> 14:59.654
and not the ordinary
folk of this country.

15:00.211 --> 15:01.390
Folk

15:01.849 --> 15:03.249
I need a cigarette.

15:08.030 --> 15:11.406
Did you coach Ellie on
what to say to police?

15:11.442 --> 15:12.431
No.

15:13.150 --> 15:16.779
Did you and... Rachel Sutherland

15:16.815 --> 15:19.206
advise her to claim that Georgia
had supplied the drugs

15:19.242 --> 15:21.713
- because Georgia was dead?
- No.

15:23.110 --> 15:24.655
- Was the Prime Minister present...
- No.

15:25.523 --> 15:27.508
Was the Prime Minister present at any

15:27.754 --> 15:30.220
meetings where such a
strategy was discussed?

15:31.010 --> 15:32.010
No.

15:34.870 --> 15:37.298
- You keep a diary.
- Mm-hm.

15:37.790 --> 15:41.390
We found some interesting extracts
on your computer.

15:42.830 --> 15:47.075
"RS." That's Robert Sutherland, right?

15:47.378 --> 15:49.318
No flies on you, Inspector.

15:51.030 --> 15:56.015
"RS very anxious not to get involved
with discussions on ES

15:56.150 --> 15:58.635
and leaving things to me and RJS."

15:58.670 --> 16:00.192
Rachel Jane Sutherland.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.195
So he knew that you two
were strategising.

16:03.426 --> 16:07.237
The only strategy was how to deal
with the inevitable press interest.

16:07.452 --> 16:11.088
"ES v upset after visit
from Georgia Nixon's father.

16:11.390 --> 16:14.830
Took a concerted effort to persuade
her to keep to script."

16:15.830 --> 16:19.255
- Figure of speech.
- "Disturbing news from the university.

16:19.291 --> 16:22.745
"When I told RS, he bit my head
off about interview strategy

16:22.781 --> 16:24.470
"with ES and police.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.492
"Told him to leave it to me and RJS.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.491
"She is much more
clear-sighted about the issues.

16:29.869 --> 16:32.723
"Need to stop AM going all Cassandra.

16:33.498 --> 16:36.098
So far RS keeping her out of it."

16:37.330 --> 16:39.330
Anna Marshall, right?

16:43.150 --> 16:45.150
At least she has an alibi.

16:48.030 --> 16:50.570
At one point in her last interview,

16:51.470 --> 16:53.950
Ellie told us that she felt...

16:54.310 --> 16:57.070
pressured into lying.

16:59.010 --> 17:02.050
She tried to backtrack but...
we've got it on tape.

17:03.070 --> 17:07.230
Now, when we get her to tell us
who was pressuring her,

17:08.010 --> 17:10.210
who do you think it will be
that she'll name?

17:12.109 --> 17:15.230
You... or her mother?

17:24.849 --> 17:26.450
And Sam knows?

17:29.490 --> 17:30.853
And he's...?

17:31.670 --> 17:33.130
Sad, I think.

17:34.155 --> 17:35.457
Uncertain.

17:37.893 --> 17:40.590
Well, I always thought it was a
good marriage, for what it's worth.

17:42.202 --> 17:43.762
In many ways, it is.

17:48.349 --> 17:49.713
So what happens now?

17:52.750 --> 17:55.802
Eleanor is running checks because
of the Toni Lulin connection.

17:56.696 --> 17:58.554
You did the right thing
going to her, of course.

17:59.231 --> 18:00.281
Of course.

18:03.630 --> 18:06.910
- But you can still see him?
- According to Eleanor, yeah.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.490
And do you want to?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.497
I'm a bit lost for words, actually.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.830
I've never... I mean, adultery.
I mean, I've never...

18:25.310 --> 18:27.065
- I'm not judging.
- Oh, don't worry.

18:29.430 --> 18:32.422
Closest I ever thought I'd get to it
was reading Tolstoy in the cottage.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.202
I've always thought it's a bit
too much like hard work.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.230
Adultery, I mean, not...

18:41.230 --> 18:42.995
...Tolstoy.

18:45.827 --> 18:48.179
Easier when your partner's
hardly ever there.

18:56.618 --> 18:57.618
Bat.

18:59.352 --> 19:00.735
Oh, God.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.743
Are bats a good omen or a bad omen?

19:05.070 --> 19:06.733
I'm not sure.

19:09.517 --> 19:10.718
Don't fuck with them though,

19:10.754 --> 19:12.471
they're better protected
than the nuclear codes.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.290
The cars are arriving.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.878
Mr Rowntree, welcome to Chequers.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.958
I believe it was Lady Thatcher

19:53.994 --> 19:57.515
who said it was impossible not
to fall in love with this place.

19:57.962 --> 20:02.395
And from your side, I believe Ramsay
MacDonald was enchanted by it.

20:02.430 --> 20:05.914
There's a splendid portrait of him
in the National Portrait Gallery

20:05.950 --> 20:07.054
here with his family.

20:07.109 --> 20:12.138
Ramsay MacDonald was not from
'my side' at all, Home Secretary.

20:12.452 --> 20:14.612
He was a traitor to the Labour movement.

20:15.150 --> 20:18.770
Still, who needs him when
you've got Francine Bridge, eh?

20:19.390 --> 20:20.787
Well, quite.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.280
Harry, welcome.

20:28.232 --> 20:29.418
Prime Minister.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.915
Are we coming in or do you want us
to wait out in the garden again?

20:33.950 --> 20:35.510
Well, you could do a lot worse.

20:35.795 --> 20:37.703
Come inside and have some tea
before we get started.

20:37.739 --> 20:38.739
Thank you.

20:39.374 --> 20:40.766
Well, this is nice.

20:41.779 --> 20:43.914
- Are People's Justice here yet?
- Not yet.

20:43.950 --> 20:46.030
Scott Minett will be arriving after...

20:47.990 --> 20:50.755
I did try and get you a ticket
for Chequers but, er,

20:50.790 --> 20:52.556
they said you weren't VIP enough.

20:52.592 --> 20:54.591
You're not on the main stage either.

20:54.627 --> 20:56.839
Just wait until this time
next year, man.

20:56.875 --> 20:59.022
No-one'll even remember
who Harry Rowntree is.

21:03.510 --> 21:05.110
No!

21:21.350 --> 21:23.475
Keep the kid inside.

21:23.510 --> 21:25.970
Scott? Scott?

21:46.649 --> 21:48.690
I'll sit next to Harry Rowntree
at dinner.

21:49.150 --> 21:51.436
- I think it should be me.
- You?

21:51.950 --> 21:54.995
We're the only two who still believe
in the undying nature

21:55.030 --> 21:56.132
of the class struggle.

21:57.134 --> 21:59.505
Well, it was a sacrifice
on my part but feel free.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.626
Scott Minett's been involved
in a hit and run.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.540
He's dead.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.466
Harry...

22:33.630 --> 22:36.035
People's Justice has called
for a boycott on talks

22:36.070 --> 22:38.595
- until Minett's death is clarified.
- Clarified?

22:39.024 --> 22:41.795
- What does that mean?
- We have to speak to them first.

22:41.830 --> 22:44.990
You can't leave.
There's no time for this.

22:46.506 --> 22:49.119
Harry. Harry!

22:49.630 --> 22:53.955
Every second that transformer stays
blocked, more lives are lost.

22:54.109 --> 22:55.892
People are dying
because of this blockade.

22:55.928 --> 22:58.293
People are dying
because of your government.

22:58.329 --> 23:01.235
We have a duty to the country.
You and I have to sort this thing out.

23:01.270 --> 23:03.699
Are you going to use the Civil
Contingencies Act to keep me here?

23:04.505 --> 23:07.910
Are you gonna throw me in front
of a tribunal if I try to leave?

23:09.250 --> 23:11.350
Are you a dictator now, Prime Minister?

23:17.190 --> 23:20.311
How do we know that you didn't have
Scott Minett taken out?

23:21.230 --> 23:23.960
Don't be so fucking ridiculous.

23:24.553 --> 23:27.123
This isn't about
the Civil Contingencies Act.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.345
- And it's not about Scott Minett either.
- Robert...

23:30.381 --> 23:31.641
It's about you

23:31.853 --> 23:34.555
acting like you're on the bridge
of the Battleship Potemkin

23:34.590 --> 23:36.915
because you can't control your members.

23:36.950 --> 23:38.647
You're competing with People's Justice

23:38.683 --> 23:40.613
while hardworking public servants

23:40.649 --> 23:43.043
battle round the clock
to get the power back on.

23:43.079 --> 23:46.355
So why don't you get back to your
barricade, you posturing idiot,

23:46.390 --> 23:49.150
- because I'm coming for you tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah?

23:49.186 --> 23:50.665
- Oh, fucking yes.
- Robert!

23:50.701 --> 23:53.555
And I'm bringing APVs and bulldozers,
so if you do feel like

23:53.590 --> 23:56.115
acting like Tiananmen Square Man,
which, quite frankly,

23:56.150 --> 23:59.390
I doubt very much,
then fucking knock yourself out.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.250
Anna.

24:14.809 --> 24:16.201
Well, that cleared the air.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.898
Fuck him. Let's get back to London.

24:23.423 --> 24:27.503
Convene COBRA.
I'm taking these bastards on now.

24:37.370 --> 24:40.295
Breaking news just now.
Reports are coming in

24:40.330 --> 24:42.455
- that Scott Minett...
- What do you want?

24:42.490 --> 24:46.375
- Vodka soda.
- Hi, two vodka sodas, please.

24:46.410 --> 24:50.468
...targeted deliberately by two men
in a grey Ford Focus.

24:50.810 --> 24:53.655
The police are looking
for both car and drivers,

24:53.690 --> 24:56.888
one of whom was described
as either black or Asian.

24:56.924 --> 24:59.406
- The journalist...
- No surprise there, then.

25:02.597 --> 25:03.903
Truth hurt, does it, love?

25:04.243 --> 25:06.334
We don't all know each other, you know.

25:06.370 --> 25:09.775
I know you. You're a politician.

25:09.949 --> 25:13.166
Bunch of crooks.
Only in it for themselves.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.617
- What did he say?
- Let's go.

25:17.701 --> 25:19.991
Hey, Dave.
Dave, do you remember that sign,

25:20.027 --> 25:21.635
"No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs"?

25:22.112 --> 25:24.415
We've only gone and got
a threefer here, mate.

25:24.450 --> 25:28.130
- I think you'd better go, mate.
- Why do we have to go?

25:28.963 --> 25:31.450
Well, it's no dogs allowed.

25:40.476 --> 25:41.750
What's so funny?

25:43.930 --> 25:48.738
Well, apart from the country going
insane, I just buried my dad.

25:49.516 --> 25:53.815
My kids won't talk to me because
their mother's a lying sociopath.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.732
And even though I've
done nothing to him,

25:55.768 --> 26:00.010
I've got some guy singing in my face
"No surrender to the IRA".

26:01.610 --> 26:04.575
What a setting for a wake,
my dad would have loved it here.

26:04.610 --> 26:05.992
It's hilarious.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.750
Let's go.

26:14.090 --> 26:17.890
That's for Scott Minett, you slags.

26:18.890 --> 26:21.490
- Keep walking.
- I was going to.

26:23.927 --> 26:26.459
- We'll set up here.
- You OK, mate?

26:27.819 --> 26:30.358
- Sure.
- What are you going to say?

26:31.495 --> 26:36.334
- What I saw.
- No, I mean, about... him... his views.

26:36.370 --> 26:38.895
You know, put it in some perspective

26:39.525 --> 26:41.735
cos you got close to him,

26:41.770 --> 26:46.090
and what with you being,
you know, diverse yourself.

26:46.921 --> 26:50.006
- Diverse.
- So you can contextualise...

26:50.210 --> 26:51.721
- Rob.
- Yeah?

26:51.757 --> 26:52.806
Shut up.

26:55.009 --> 26:56.571
- Let's go...
- Yeah.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.895
Earlier today I witnessed
the brutal attack on Scott Minett

27:06.930 --> 27:10.403
which was unquestionably deliberate.
The mood on the streets is...

27:10.439 --> 27:12.599
Rob. Rob!

27:15.471 --> 27:17.356
Get in. Get in!

27:36.890 --> 27:39.895
It's gonna kick off big time.
They killed that Scott Minett,

27:39.930 --> 27:41.284
- didn't they?
- Who's they?

27:41.690 --> 27:45.295
Who do you think?
He just got too popular, didn't he?

27:45.454 --> 27:47.575
They were never going to meet him,
it's obvious.

27:47.610 --> 27:50.054
Why would a bunch of people here
in London care about a man...

27:50.090 --> 27:51.548
People are fed up of
everything, in't they?

27:52.031 --> 27:54.426
Lying politicians, no food in the shops.

27:55.696 --> 27:57.813
Maybe we should drop you first.

27:58.117 --> 28:00.640
You can come back to mine
for a bit if you like?

28:02.130 --> 28:04.330
Will you take us to Kennington, please?

28:12.210 --> 28:14.006
This is gonna be far worse
than last time.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.366
Welcome back, Anna.

28:18.090 --> 28:20.530
If anyone can sort out
this shit-show it's you.

28:21.840 --> 28:26.460
That is your boyfriend having
dinner with Toni Lulin.

28:29.439 --> 28:32.604
Lulin's business interests
are highly complex.

28:32.890 --> 28:34.608
Some are quite legitimate.

28:34.644 --> 28:37.666
He runs a very successful
fibre-optics company.

28:37.910 --> 28:41.750
Others less so. The Turkish heroin
trade being the most obvious.

28:43.170 --> 28:46.455
- So Edin could be involved?
- There is a rumour that Toni Lulin

28:46.490 --> 28:49.454
uses an assassin. Based in London.

28:50.246 --> 28:54.850
The assassin goes under the pseudonym
of Nico and is greatly feared.

29:00.770 --> 29:03.650
- No. No way.
- I don't know.

29:05.423 --> 29:07.250
But I'm definitely going to find out.

29:09.650 --> 29:12.264
I need to talk to you, Mum.
Can I come and see you?

29:12.300 --> 29:15.073
No. You need to stay inside.
The situation is really volatile

29:15.109 --> 29:16.300
in London right now.

29:16.336 --> 29:19.844
- Where's Barney?
- Upstairs. Look, I have to...

29:19.880 --> 29:22.440
I wanna talk about what's
happening to our family.

29:22.610 --> 29:25.535
You said I can come and see you
at the Pimlico flat any time.

29:25.746 --> 29:27.684
Am I just not important to you now?

29:28.010 --> 29:30.068
That's really unfair.

29:31.739 --> 29:34.864
Look, please don't leave
the house tonight, all right?

29:34.900 --> 29:36.855
We are getting reports
of rioting breaking out.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.590
I will try to come home later but
I need to speak to your dad first.

29:40.170 --> 29:43.298
All right? I love you. Bye.

30:12.490 --> 30:15.775
We've had reports of
disturbances from a number of places

30:15.810 --> 30:18.815
- and not just the crisis zones.
- Sheer opportunism.

30:18.850 --> 30:22.375
We should round them up and use
Wembley as a mass detention centre.

30:22.410 --> 30:24.975
Never really lost that loving
feeling for Pinochet,

30:25.010 --> 30:26.064
have you, Archie?

30:26.100 --> 30:28.855
A great man and an honourable soldier.

30:28.890 --> 30:32.335
If I could drag us away from
murderous dictators for a moment

30:32.370 --> 30:35.055
- and back to our current problem...
- Please do.

30:35.248 --> 30:37.575
Anyone who is angry right now
is coming out onto the streets

30:37.610 --> 30:39.087
and that is a hell of a lot of people.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.685
Manchester, Birmingham, London.

30:41.721 --> 30:44.681
The problem is that it's been a long
time since Northern Ireland.

30:44.843 --> 30:49.008
We used to be a world leader in
handling serious urban disturbances.

30:49.044 --> 30:51.884
Well, I want troops deployed
on the streets tonight.

30:53.063 --> 30:56.275
I'll authorise the use of CS gas
and baton rounds if necessary.

30:56.311 --> 30:57.902
And if it requires more than that?

30:58.252 --> 31:00.212
If my men come under serious attack?

31:02.638 --> 31:05.788
You were unwilling to make
that decision earlier.

31:09.950 --> 31:12.515
We will restore legitimate authority
in the Red Zone,

31:12.551 --> 31:15.316
clear the roads for the transformer
and deal robustly

31:15.352 --> 31:19.249
with further rioting in our cities.
No more velvet gloves.

31:39.284 --> 31:40.701
Why did you leave her?

31:43.343 --> 31:44.582
Lots of things.

31:45.895 --> 31:48.417
Values, lifestyle,

31:49.495 --> 31:52.515
aspirations, politics.

31:52.550 --> 31:55.686
- So just the small stuff, then.
- The kids are all I care about.

31:56.350 --> 32:00.075
But she's managed to make them
believe I am responsible

32:00.110 --> 32:03.430
for all the bad things,
and there's nothing I can do about it.

32:05.883 --> 32:08.003
Well, it's obviously
made you very unhappy.

32:09.610 --> 32:11.436
Maybe you should talk
to someone about it.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.045
People talk too much.

32:14.374 --> 32:18.099
They should bottle it all up
until it gets too much.

32:18.575 --> 32:21.874
- And then they should medicate.
- That still working for you, is it?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.920
I like you, Fraser.

32:34.193 --> 32:35.893
I like you, too.

33:01.197 --> 33:03.212
First reports of fatalities.

33:04.327 --> 33:06.764
A man was attacked and beaten to death

33:06.800 --> 33:08.198
trying to protect his shop.

33:08.755 --> 33:11.795
Two dead in flats above shops
that were set on fire.

33:13.305 --> 33:15.005
I can't let this continue.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.753
- I cannot let anarchy prevail.
- I agree.

33:22.342 --> 33:24.502
- Even if this time it means...
- A risk to life.

33:41.741 --> 33:45.075
Hello, this is the Prime Minister.
Have General Pickering

33:45.110 --> 33:46.596
meet me in the COBRA room, please.

33:48.324 --> 33:50.569
Oh sorry, you may not have heard me.

33:50.605 --> 33:53.868
This is the fucking Prime Minister.
Get General Pickering

33:53.904 --> 33:57.464
out of his meeting and have him meet
me in the COBRA room immediately.

34:11.770 --> 34:13.333
The city's burning.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.216
Hello?

34:28.969 --> 34:31.935
OK, coming now. I gotta go.

34:32.290 --> 34:34.495
- Now?
- That was the Prime Minister.

34:35.355 --> 34:38.010
He's about to take out the barricades
to release the transformer.

34:45.590 --> 34:48.270
2-1 in position.
All subjects are inside the nest.

34:50.003 --> 34:53.255
Allow the deal to proceed 2-1.
2-1 on standby.

34:53.290 --> 34:56.277
- I think we all can agree to the terms, right?
- Yeah.

34:56.726 --> 35:00.975
Everything is in place.
The shipment will be arriving next week.

35:01.335 --> 35:03.570
Nico will be your final contact.

35:03.650 --> 35:05.610
He will be in touch with you
nearer the time.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.695
2-1 has the eyeball
on an unidentified female

35:13.730 --> 35:15.690
approaching the nest.

35:43.204 --> 35:44.338
Where's my mum?

35:46.244 --> 35:47.430
You're Tess, right?

35:47.930 --> 35:50.341
- Where's my mum?
- She's not here.

35:52.770 --> 35:55.387
- Let me go!
- I got her.

35:55.423 --> 35:56.656
What are you doing?

35:59.970 --> 36:02.975
The unidentified female
is Anna Marshall's daughter.

36:03.010 --> 36:05.905
- Should we go in?
- See how this plays out 2-1.

36:06.486 --> 36:08.295
- Trust me.
- _

36:10.727 --> 36:11.991
_

36:12.027 --> 36:15.005
_

36:16.473 --> 36:17.753
_

36:18.422 --> 36:20.465
- _
- _

36:23.095 --> 36:24.095
_

36:24.726 --> 36:26.542
_

36:26.604 --> 36:27.669
No!

36:29.650 --> 36:32.650
- Help me!
- Trust me.

36:34.245 --> 36:35.778
_

36:36.302 --> 36:37.302
_

36:37.454 --> 36:39.536
_

36:40.282 --> 36:42.239
_

36:48.463 --> 36:52.463
Come with me.
You're going to be all right. Come on.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.895
2-1 has the eyeball
on Loverboy, he has the girl.

36:58.243 --> 37:00.735
All other targets are leaving the nest.

37:01.195 --> 37:04.691
Let them leave 2-1.
Arrest team incoming for Loverboy.

37:04.727 --> 37:07.727
Make sure the girl is safe and we'll
get a message to Eleanor James.

37:09.522 --> 37:11.615
We have intelligence
that a far-right group

37:11.650 --> 37:14.055
called National Spirit has
infiltrated the protestors.

37:14.090 --> 37:16.535
They have links to the armed
forces so probably not wise...

37:16.570 --> 37:19.615
Not a moment longer. I made a promise
to the people in the hospital

37:19.650 --> 37:21.467
that I would turn the lights back on

37:21.503 --> 37:23.593
and I am going to keep
that fucking promise.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.602
Lives are already being lost.
Take that barricade down.

37:57.210 --> 37:59.735
Charlie, Charlie, 1,
advance to the blockade.

39:00.730 --> 39:04.770
The barricade is down.
But the protestors...

39:05.633 --> 39:07.953
The first barricade is cleared.

39:07.989 --> 39:10.015
But there are more
protestors approaching.

39:40.850 --> 39:43.210
We need to take control
of this situation.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.757
We're pushing their lines back well.

40:38.810 --> 40:40.810
Incoming!

40:48.050 --> 40:50.415
- What the hell was that?
- Phosphorous grenade.

40:50.450 --> 40:52.342
These are military grade weapons.

40:52.573 --> 40:55.047
Do I have authorisation to return fire?

40:55.849 --> 40:56.985
They should retreat.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.659
If they have grenades,
they may have guns.

41:00.810 --> 41:02.864
Robert, listen to me. We can take stock.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.727
Do I have authorisation?

41:05.330 --> 41:07.330
Anna, tell him.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.975
They're throwing grenades
at British soldiers.

41:11.010 --> 41:14.375
This isn't a protest, Robert,
it's an armed attack.

41:14.410 --> 41:15.952
It's too risky.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.262
I'm authorising you to return fire.

41:20.610 --> 41:24.055
Colonel, you have authorisation
to defend yourself

41:24.090 --> 41:28.742
with live ammunition. Send fire team
forward, rules of engagement apply.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.535
Copy that. Over.

41:30.570 --> 41:34.455
Riflemen forward! Riflemen forward!

41:34.490 --> 41:38.650
Disperse! Disperse! Force will be used!

41:47.850 --> 41:50.295
- Rules of Engagement!
- Yes, Sarge!

41:50.330 --> 41:53.370
3-1-Alpha, what are you seeing?
What are you seeing? Over.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.730
Watch your front!

42:03.010 --> 42:05.010
Weapon!

42:06.305 --> 42:12.532
