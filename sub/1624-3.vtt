00:01.202 --> 00:03.257
***

00:05.346 --> 00:07.167
Max, a woman in my section wants to know

00:07.287 --> 00:09.218
if we do anything gluten-free.
What do I tell her?

00:09.338 --> 00:12.466
Tell her she's not allergic to gluten,
she's just masking an eating disorder.

00:14.805 --> 00:17.906
Look alive, people.
Club sandwich, burger medium,

00:18.146 --> 00:20.513
and a shrimp salad
for the gamblin' man.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.131
I asked for salt and pepper.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.967
I wanted
mayonnaise and mustard.

00:26.737 --> 00:28.104
You forgot my diet soda.

00:28.106 --> 00:30.106
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'll be right back with--

00:30.108 --> 00:32.019
Oh, what?

00:35.312 --> 00:37.697
Never doubt me.

00:37.817 --> 00:47.757

00:47.759 --> 00:51.010
Here's my last check, Earl.

00:51.012 --> 00:55.131
Look here, Max. That lady
just slipped me her number.

00:55.133 --> 00:58.051
Like I need another
menopausal white woman

00:58.053 --> 01:00.937
scratchin' at my window
like a cat in heat.

01:04.891 --> 01:06.159
God, I love money.

01:06.161 --> 01:10.263
I know, I'm so sorry
it broke up with you.

01:10.265 --> 01:13.450
Look! This week's new iPad
just came out.

01:13.452 --> 01:15.652
Spread the words.

01:15.654 --> 01:16.736
Word.

01:16.738 --> 01:19.739
Word!

01:19.741 --> 01:22.709
I saw that on <i>The Wire.</i>

01:22.711 --> 01:24.627
Max, three weeks in a row

01:24.629 --> 01:29.549
you have not yet accepted my
request to be a Facebook friend.

01:29.551 --> 01:32.419
Max?
I am talking to you.

01:32.421 --> 01:35.505
Oh, I didn't hear you,
I have my earbuds in.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.658
What are these?

01:38.660 --> 01:41.728
Okay, you had to bust a move,
and get "the truth" on my ass?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.480
Fine, let's go there.
Han,

01:43.482 --> 01:45.515
I'm never gonna be
your Facebook friend.

01:45.517 --> 01:50.487
Oof!
Hard to hear.

01:50.489 --> 01:52.489
Well, I accepted you, Han.

01:52.491 --> 01:56.860
Yes, thank you.
You make my heart sing.

01:56.862 --> 01:59.729
Oof.
Hurt me still.

02:02.249 --> 02:06.870
That was like watching someone
club a baby seal.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.922
Why wouldn't you just say yes
to his friend request?

02:08.924 --> 02:11.374
Because I never
check Facebook, why would I?

02:11.376 --> 02:14.210
So some girl I worked
at a movie theater with in 2005

02:14.212 --> 02:18.014
can tell me it's raining
and she's "totes bummed?"

02:18.016 --> 02:21.217
Caroline!
Better check Facebook page.

02:21.219 --> 02:25.472
Maybe someone
just post on your wall.

02:29.109 --> 02:33.897
"Han Lee has tagged you
in 25 photos?"

02:40.788 --> 02:45.041
Want to borrow
my seal club yet?

02:45.043 --> 02:49.662
Oh, that stings. I've lost
like 300 Facebook friends

02:49.664 --> 02:51.664
since my father was arrested.

02:51.666 --> 02:52.665
Well, your father's probably

02:52.667 --> 02:54.217
made that many new friends
in prison,

02:54.219 --> 02:57.420
so it all evens out.

02:57.422 --> 02:58.721
Okay, ready to go?

02:58.723 --> 03:00.006
Do we have to?

03:00.008 --> 03:03.810
It's so hot outside.
When did heat get so hot?

03:03.812 --> 03:06.379
Stop fighting it,
just give in to it.

03:06.381 --> 03:10.817
I don't know why
I'm quoting a rapist.

03:10.819 --> 03:12.402
Can't we just stay
a little bit longer?

03:12.404 --> 03:14.303
We don't have
any A.C. at home.

03:14.305 --> 03:17.490
I have an A.C.
you girls can use.

03:17.492 --> 03:19.275
You have an air conditioner
that works?

03:19.277 --> 03:20.977
Oh, it works.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.671 --> 03:34.007
That's like an A.C. that just had salami.

03:34.009 --> 03:37.961
There's more salami
where that came from.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.052
And my feet hurt.

03:46.054 --> 03:47.554
Well, you gotta stop
wearing those stilts,

03:47.556 --> 03:50.640
and get a pair of Skechers, like
normal broke-ass waitresses.

03:50.642 --> 03:55.278
Skechers?
How dare you.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.313
Besides,
I can't afford new shoes.

03:57.315 --> 03:59.115
These cost $900.

03:59.117 --> 04:02.352
Well, then that's not pain,
that's karma.

04:02.354 --> 04:04.237
Look,
I will help you out, okay?

04:04.239 --> 04:05.204
I know a place we can go

04:05.206 --> 04:07.240
that has designer things
at good prices.

04:07.242 --> 04:09.358
Like a Barney's warehouse?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.044
Kind of.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.817
The Goodwill?

04:17.819 --> 04:20.470
Welcome to my place!

04:22.638 --> 04:24.504
We're shopping at the Goodwill?

04:24.519 --> 04:26.523
You led me to believe
we were real-shopping.

04:26.525 --> 04:27.991
I know.

04:27.993 --> 04:29.542
I couldn't wait to see your face
when you saw this place.

04:29.544 --> 04:31.077
Do the face again.

04:31.079 --> 04:33.797
I love it!

04:33.799 --> 04:35.498
Okay, what's that smell?

04:35.500 --> 04:38.585
It's gonna be your smell
from now on.

04:38.587 --> 04:41.171
Now, pay attention,
I know where the good stuff is.

04:41.173 --> 04:42.439
I know where the good stuff is.

04:42.441 --> 04:44.674
Madison and 57th.

04:44.676 --> 04:46.760
Follow me.

04:46.762 --> 04:49.813
Clever bitches hide stuff
they want to come back and buy,

04:49.815 --> 04:52.916
'cause sometimes they don't have
$3 to buy it at the time.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.851
Who doesn't have $3?

04:54.853 --> 04:56.319
You.

04:56.321 --> 04:58.738
Last week
I hid a dope vintage blazer

04:58.740 --> 05:01.825
in the back of a nightstand,
and here it is!

05:01.827 --> 05:05.111
Six bucks, clever bitch.
Bang, bang!

05:05.113 --> 05:08.248
All right, well, we're here.
I'm gonna make the best of it,

05:08.250 --> 05:12.502
but first I need a basket
without a sno-cone in it.

05:12.504 --> 05:13.620
Hey, Trish.

05:13.622 --> 05:16.456
Not for day-to-day,
but at the country club.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.826
You're kidding,
but you're right.

05:19.828 --> 05:22.846
Hey, when you find something,
check the pockets for pills.

05:22.848 --> 05:25.048
At a thrift store downtown
I found a purple one once,

05:25.050 --> 05:28.718
and took it.
Fell asleep for eight hours.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.488
That was my vacation that year.

05:32.557 --> 05:34.307
Yay, shoes!

05:34.309 --> 05:37.277
Oh, I can't believe I just said,
"yay," in Goodwill.

05:37.279 --> 05:39.929
Look, don't freak.
Shoes can be funky,

05:39.931 --> 05:42.532
but I have a special spray at
home that makes them like new.

05:42.534 --> 05:46.018
Did you get it from a wizard?

05:49.773 --> 05:52.909
Oh, my God.

05:52.911 --> 05:56.246
Oh, my God,
these Brian Atwoods were mine.

05:56.248 --> 05:57.881
I donated these to charity,

05:57.883 --> 06:01.835
'cause I was photographed
wearing them twice.

06:01.837 --> 06:04.871
Okay, they were $800
when I bought them,

06:04.873 --> 06:07.373
now they're $8?

06:07.375 --> 06:12.428
Like me. I'm $8.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.881
Oh, my God.

06:14.883 --> 06:17.233
I'm $8.

06:18.436 --> 06:20.687
I've been reduced.

06:20.689 --> 06:23.573
I'm sorry, it just
all became so real to me.

06:23.575 --> 06:26.025
I mean, I can't believe it.

06:31.248 --> 06:35.051
Um, didn't you see me crying?

06:35.053 --> 06:38.621
Lots of people cry at Goodwill.

06:38.623 --> 06:40.290
You go to France,
you eat snails.

06:40.292 --> 06:42.992
You come here, you cry.

06:42.994 --> 06:45.795
That's odd,
you didn't even react.

06:45.797 --> 06:47.847
You need to react
when people cry.

06:47.849 --> 06:50.683
I did, I rolled my eyes.

06:52.070 --> 06:56.539
Look, eventually, you'll learn
to do that on the inside.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.358
Okay, well, just FYI,

06:58.360 --> 07:00.560
when I used to cry in front of
my other girlfriends,

07:00.562 --> 07:03.062
they'd be like,
"What you cryin' about, C-line?

07:03.064 --> 07:04.447
"Look at you, girl,
you're fierce,

07:04.449 --> 07:06.549
you got your glam on."

07:06.551 --> 07:10.169
Are your girlfriends
black drag queens?

07:14.291 --> 07:16.743
Oh, awesome strokes tee.

07:16.745 --> 07:19.579
I went to this concert,
but I couldn't afford the shirt.

07:19.581 --> 07:22.114
Oh, we're done with me.

07:22.116 --> 07:23.800
I went to see them on this tour

07:23.802 --> 07:26.569
the summer after my junior year.
It was a really warm night,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.255
and I snuck out of the house,
and we all ma--

07:29.257 --> 07:30.924
Ahem.
Whatever.

07:30.926 --> 07:32.175
And what?

07:32.177 --> 07:34.761
What, did something great happen
the night you got the t?

07:34.763 --> 07:37.847
Look at me, does it look like
something great ever happens?

07:37.849 --> 07:39.749
Hey, cute tee.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.917
Had my eye on it.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.802
I was just
bringin' my girl back to see it.

07:42.804 --> 07:44.237
She was in the bathroom.

07:44.239 --> 07:46.439
I had to throw up.

07:46.441 --> 07:47.774
So hand it over.

07:47.776 --> 07:49.025
You know the rule.

07:49.027 --> 07:53.363
Turn the back on the rack,
you're under attack.

07:53.365 --> 07:56.749
That's not me,
that's the law of the 'Will.

07:59.036 --> 08:04.707
Yeah,
you better walk away.

08:04.709 --> 08:05.908
That was intense.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.928
Ah, just another Wednesday
at the 'Will.

08:08.930 --> 08:13.132
You said to look in things,
right?

08:13.134 --> 08:15.685
Max, look.
On my first try!

08:15.687 --> 08:19.022
Ooh, slick. Whoever
hid those is gonna be pissed.

08:19.024 --> 08:21.007
Quality check.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.628
Fabric sturdy,
no mysterious crotch stains,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.114
nice work, Nancy Drew.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.816
And look, they're designer.

08:29.818 --> 08:32.902
Summer 2009. $350.

08:32.904 --> 08:35.405
And for me today...

08:35.407 --> 08:38.323
$5.
That's a reduction I like.

08:38.326 --> 08:41.159
$5!
Oh!

08:41.162 --> 08:45.298
$5, $5, $5, $5...

08:45.300 --> 08:47.450
$5, $5...

08:47.452 --> 08:49.585
Hi, Maria.

08:49.587 --> 08:50.970
How are you, Max?

08:50.972 --> 08:52.255
I'm good, how's your mom doin'?

08:52.257 --> 08:55.341
Good. She really appreciated
the cupcakes you made her.

08:55.343 --> 08:58.227
Hi, Maria, I'm Caroline,
Max's friend.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.763
Any way we can get
the price down a bit for these?

09:00.765 --> 09:03.649
I think $8 is steep,
considering their condition.

09:03.651 --> 09:06.019
I happen to know
the heel has been replaced.

09:06.021 --> 09:09.822
I cannot believe
you're trying to shoe her down.

09:09.824 --> 09:11.774
I can do $6.

09:11.776 --> 09:13.559
Deal.

09:13.561 --> 09:14.777
Oh, you happy?

09:14.779 --> 09:17.580
You haggled a charity.

09:17.582 --> 09:20.450
You're turning Goodwill
into bad will.

09:22.503 --> 09:24.754
My t-shirt's gone.

09:24.756 --> 09:26.072
It's not here.

09:26.074 --> 09:29.509
I bet it was that
Puerto Rican girl,

09:29.511 --> 09:31.461
who was--
who was eyeing it.

09:31.463 --> 09:33.012
Maria, can we call security?

09:33.014 --> 09:35.414
I'm sure one of the cameras
must have captured the theft.

09:35.416 --> 09:38.768
Cameras? What do you think
this is, target?

09:38.770 --> 09:41.253
It's gone, Caroline.

09:41.255 --> 09:42.405
She must have stolen it

09:42.407 --> 09:44.857
while I was watching you
do your stupid $5 dance.

09:44.859 --> 09:50.029
I didn't turn my back on
the rack, why am I under attack?

09:50.031 --> 09:53.099
See, this is why I shop alone,
this is why I eat alone,

09:53.101 --> 09:56.452
this is why I'm leaving alone.

09:56.454 --> 09:58.488
Maria, I'll pay for these.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.207
You don't have to box them,
you can just use tissue paper.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.793
Even as I'm saying this,
I know it's not gonna happen.

10:10.806 --> 10:12.160
Chestnut...

10:12.400 --> 10:14.023
Hot as a mother, right?

10:19.657 --> 10:21.157
Better, right?

10:23.695 --> 10:24.778
# It's gettin' hot in here #

10:24.780 --> 10:25.812
# so hot! #

10:25.814 --> 10:27.664
# so take off all your clothes #

10:27.666 --> 10:29.933
# I am gettin' so hot #

10:29.935 --> 10:33.920
# I'm gonna take
my clothes off #

10:33.922 --> 10:35.505
You might want to
keep your voice down.

10:35.507 --> 10:38.675
This building has
three registered sex offenders.

10:38.677 --> 10:41.094
# It's gettin' hot in here #

10:41.096 --> 10:44.614
# so leave all that strokes
tee shirt drama behind #

10:44.616 --> 10:46.316
Come on, it's our night off.

10:46.318 --> 10:49.052
Let's go get drunk
in air conditioning.

10:49.054 --> 10:50.820
We won't even
have to pay for drinks.

10:50.822 --> 10:54.507
These "shotes"
is gonna pay for our drinks.

10:54.509 --> 10:58.561
You are literally
a $5 whore right now.

10:58.563 --> 10:59.846
Come on.

10:59.848 --> 11:01.648
# Ai-ee ai-ee #

11:01.650 --> 11:02.866
# ai-ee ai-ee #

11:04.987 --> 11:06.953
Hey, Johnny.

11:06.955 --> 11:08.038
I thought I told you

11:08.040 --> 11:09.956
to keep your dumb, tragic ass
out of here.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.492
The only thing that
isn't tragic about me is my ass.

11:12.494 --> 11:15.078
And who's
the blonde, bony skank?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.529
Oh, dude, she's not in on this.

11:16.531 --> 11:17.864
Oh, I'm so sorry, miss.

11:17.866 --> 11:21.084
Hey, I'm Johnny,
I'm Max's friend.

11:21.086 --> 11:24.054
I'm Caroline.
I'm freaked out.

11:24.056 --> 11:25.371
This is something we do.

11:25.373 --> 11:29.042
- To remind us of our families.
- Mm-hmm.

11:29.044 --> 11:31.311
Excuse me for a second.
These guys tip more

11:31.313 --> 11:34.047
if I high-five 'em
when we talk about chicks.

11:34.049 --> 11:35.214
Vagina!

11:35.216 --> 11:37.100
Yeah!

11:37.102 --> 11:40.854
Wow. Girl,
your bartender friend is cute.

11:40.856 --> 11:44.157
Look at those arms.
Nice guns.

11:44.159 --> 11:46.076
He's not just a bartender,
this dude is legit.

11:46.078 --> 11:48.528
He's a street artist,
goes by "Jpeg."

11:48.530 --> 11:50.080
Hmm.
Well, right now

11:50.082 --> 11:52.565
he's cutting up limes
and cleaning glasses.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.084
Well, you're an heiress

11:54.086 --> 11:56.619
who's slinging burnt hash
and stale toast.

11:56.621 --> 11:57.637
Touche.

11:57.639 --> 11:59.739
Douch-ay.

11:59.741 --> 12:02.342
These are from the gentleman
with a sweet note,

12:02.344 --> 12:05.595
"Nice ass, nice rack."

12:09.917 --> 12:11.267
Whoo!

12:11.269 --> 12:13.103
Hoo.

12:15.923 --> 12:17.524
If that's your tequila noise,

12:17.526 --> 12:20.944
God knows
what your orgasm sounds like.

12:20.946 --> 12:25.398
Same face, no sound.

12:29.203 --> 12:30.787
Oh, my God.

12:30.789 --> 12:33.373
I can't believe it,
it's the girl from the 'Will.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.743
I got your back, gir-r-r.

12:39.246 --> 12:40.279
What is she doin'?

12:40.281 --> 12:41.915
She thinks Goodwill
has made her tough.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.283
Um, hi.
How are you?

12:44.285 --> 12:45.468
I just wanted to talk to you

12:45.470 --> 12:47.170
about that shirt
at the Goodwill.

12:47.172 --> 12:50.957
See, my friend really wanted it,
and, well, your friend has it.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.727
What are you sayin', bitch?

12:53.729 --> 12:56.295
Okay, I think we might have
got off on the wrong foot.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.314
Do you want to feel my foot,
bitch?

12:58.316 --> 13:01.467
Well, I guess we know
what your favorite word is.

13:02.153 --> 13:03.636
Ow!

13:03.638 --> 13:07.407
Those are not extensions,
bitch!

13:07.409 --> 13:08.591
Oh!

13:08.593 --> 13:10.026
I should break this up,
I should break this up.

13:10.028 --> 13:12.312
No, no, no, give her like four
seconds to learn her lesson.

13:12.314 --> 13:13.413
Oh, okay, ow!
All right. All right!

13:13.415 --> 13:16.132
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Ow! Oh, oh.

13:16.134 --> 13:17.417
Okay, come on, come on.

13:17.419 --> 13:18.835
- Oh!
- It's okay.

13:21.672 --> 13:24.541
Those are not extensions,
bitch!

13:25.927 --> 13:28.211
Are you still laughing,
'cause it wasn't funny.

13:28.213 --> 13:30.964
It was so funny.
It was like looney tunes funny.

13:30.966 --> 13:33.433
It was like Bugs Bunny
getting shot in the face funny.

13:33.435 --> 13:34.634
Only in your version,

13:34.636 --> 13:38.221
Bugs Bunny tries to have
a dialogue with the shotgun.

13:38.223 --> 13:39.889
I was trying

13:39.891 --> 13:41.191
to get your t-shirt back.

13:41.193 --> 13:42.392
I wanted you to have it,

13:42.394 --> 13:44.477
because you lit up at the 'Will
when you saw it.

13:44.479 --> 13:46.345
I do not light up, okay?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.681
There's no light inside me.

13:48.683 --> 13:50.233
What you're seeing
is probably radiation

13:50.235 --> 13:52.318
from the summer
I collected uranium tubes

13:52.320 --> 13:54.687
by the train tracks.
That was good money.

13:54.689 --> 13:56.522
Thanks for looking out for me,
Caroline.

13:56.524 --> 13:57.791
You're welcome, Max.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.959
It's a t-shirt,
it's gone.

13:59.961 --> 14:01.461
I don't get attached to things.

14:01.463 --> 14:03.863
Ow. My nail practically
got torn off back there

14:03.865 --> 14:06.332
by "Cat Von D-Minus."

14:06.334 --> 14:07.984
I'm gonna have to
sleep with it elevated.

14:07.986 --> 14:09.385
Is there a nail place
around here?

14:09.387 --> 14:10.804
Well, this is New York,

14:10.806 --> 14:13.006
so there's probably
gonna be one right...

14:13.008 --> 14:15.208
here.
Love when that happens.

14:15.210 --> 14:17.744
Look, a two-for-one
girlfriend special. Genius.

14:17.746 --> 14:20.763
Go with me tomorrow before work,
it'll be cheaper if we both go.

14:20.765 --> 14:22.148
I really need one.

14:22.150 --> 14:23.883
Plus, you need one, too.

14:23.885 --> 14:27.020
Well, I can't. I have my own
day of luxury already booked.

14:27.022 --> 14:30.156
I'm doing a laundry, and then
the tasting menu at Wendy's.

14:30.158 --> 14:33.726
Come on. You and me, nails,
and air conditioning.

14:33.728 --> 14:34.944
It'll be fun.

14:34.946 --> 14:36.112
You're doin' it,
gir-r-rl.

14:36.114 --> 14:38.665
Me and my friends
used to love getting manicures.

14:38.667 --> 14:42.202
'Cause they're black drag queens?

14:42.204 --> 14:44.070
# Ai-ee ai-ee #

14:44.072 --> 14:46.656
# ai-ee ai-ee #

15:05.242 --> 15:06.259
Oh.

15:06.261 --> 15:07.815
Hey, dude.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.249
It's about that time?

15:16.738 --> 15:19.572
Let me get the pooper scooper.

15:21.743 --> 15:25.628
All right.
Let's do this.

15:29.733 --> 15:33.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:33.421 --> 15:35.838
Let me ask you something.
How is it that you,

15:35.840 --> 15:38.424
a horse, and Caroline
are both living with me,

15:38.426 --> 15:40.260
and you're
less of a problem for me?

15:40.262 --> 15:42.295
I mean, you tell me,
you've known her longer.

15:42.297 --> 15:44.647
She picks a fight
with a tatted-out white chick

15:44.649 --> 15:47.767
from the Bronx?
What is up with that?

15:47.769 --> 15:50.636
I don't know, man,
I'm just used to it.

15:50.638 --> 15:53.456
That's what you'd sound like,
if you talked.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.425
I agree with you,
by the way.

15:55.427 --> 15:57.994
Everything you say is right,
Max.

15:57.996 --> 16:00.496
Thank you, Chestnut.

16:00.498 --> 16:02.498
You should kill her.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.734
Chestnut!
I can't do that.

16:04.736 --> 16:08.288
It'll be easy.
We could kill her and eat her.

16:08.290 --> 16:10.273
Chestnut!

16:11.843 --> 16:14.677
All right, buddy,
here's your spot.

16:14.679 --> 16:17.347
Come on, do your business.

16:17.349 --> 16:18.848
Come on, Ches.

16:18.850 --> 16:20.833
Buh-buh-buh buh-buh.

16:20.835 --> 16:22.885
Buh-buh-buh buh-boo.
Come on.

16:22.887 --> 16:24.854
Come on!

16:24.856 --> 16:27.357
Come on, Chestnut,
I got a lot of crap to do today.

16:28.176 --> 16:29.943
And so do you.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.812
Jeez, don't be shy, buddy...

16:39.759 --> 16:43.144
I hope you're happy. I look
like a Cambodian stripper.

16:46.216 --> 16:50.035
Um, they prefer to be called
"ping pong ball artists."

16:50.037 --> 16:54.172
These cost $70.43.

16:54.174 --> 16:58.292
She forced me to get tips,
and then tip her for the tips.

16:58.294 --> 17:00.261
See, and all because
you never showed up,

17:00.263 --> 17:01.930
I didn't get
the two-for-one discount,

17:01.932 --> 17:04.098
because I was waiting alone,
for you.

17:04.101 --> 17:07.519
Max, I have really tried
to be girlfriends with you,

17:07.521 --> 17:09.686
but you obviously
have some issues.

17:09.689 --> 17:11.439
Follow me to the walk-in.

17:11.441 --> 17:14.659
Good, let's get it out.

17:21.951 --> 17:24.868
Here.

17:27.073 --> 17:29.074
I thought we were gonna talk.

17:29.076 --> 17:32.377
No, we just didn't have
any chocolate cream in the case.

17:32.379 --> 17:34.179
Why didn't you show up?

17:34.181 --> 17:35.930
You told me
you were gonna be there.

17:35.932 --> 17:37.766
Well,
I had a lot of crap to do.

17:37.768 --> 17:39.834
Well, you gave me
the impression you were going.

17:39.836 --> 17:42.804
I gave you the impression?
I don't do impressions.

17:42.806 --> 17:45.090
Well, wait, that's not true,
I do one, my mom.

17:45.092 --> 17:46.674
But to do that.
I need a Christmas tree,

17:46.676 --> 17:49.727
a gallon of vodka,
and a lit cigarette.

17:49.729 --> 17:52.847
So are we
gonna be girlfriends or not?

17:52.849 --> 17:55.900
Look, I'm gonna
give this to you straight up.

17:55.902 --> 17:58.853
I am never gonna be the type
of girlfriend you're used to.

17:58.855 --> 18:02.157
I am not your gir-r-r,
or your gir-r-rl,

18:02.159 --> 18:03.491
and I am definitely not

18:03.493 --> 18:05.910
someone's two-for-one girlfriend
crap at a nail store.

18:05.912 --> 18:09.164
In fact, think of me as a dude.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.149
So-o-o,
are we good?

18:11.151 --> 18:13.585
Yeah. We good.

18:13.587 --> 18:15.386
I get it.
You're not a girl's girl.

18:15.388 --> 18:17.338
Okay, good.

18:19.158 --> 18:21.893
I can be a girl's girl.

18:25.965 --> 18:27.315
Oh, Caroline,

18:27.317 --> 18:31.152
please do not take
advantage of me with your horse.

18:31.154 --> 18:32.237
What?

18:32.239 --> 18:34.239
My trash pick up company
charged me extra,

18:34.241 --> 18:37.391
because my dumpster is full
of all your horse droppings.

18:37.393 --> 18:40.228
How would that be possible?

18:40.230 --> 18:42.664
I see your good friend, Max,
walking your horse every morning

18:42.666 --> 18:46.534
and dropping droppings
in my dumpster.

18:46.536 --> 18:48.186
Hi.

18:48.188 --> 18:49.737
Hello.

18:49.739 --> 18:52.006
Did you walk my horse today?

18:52.008 --> 18:54.292
Yeah, and every other morning.

18:54.294 --> 18:56.544
That's so sweet.
I wish I had known.

18:56.546 --> 18:58.847
Well, what was I gonna do,
post it on your Facebook wall?

18:58.849 --> 19:02.584
"Ha, walked a horse again today.
Totes gross."

19:02.586 --> 19:04.769
Besides, who did you think
was doing it?

19:04.771 --> 19:06.571
I've always just
had things done for me,

19:06.573 --> 19:08.973
I've never really thought about
the people doing them.

19:08.975 --> 19:10.892
Yeah, and I've never had
things done for me,

19:10.894 --> 19:12.477
so I just do them.

19:12.479 --> 19:14.279
Like now,
how I'm making the coffee,

19:14.281 --> 19:16.764
and you're just standing here
watching me.

19:16.766 --> 19:19.117
Still,
I wish you would have told me,

19:19.119 --> 19:20.318
so I could say thank you.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.103
Well, it's not really my style.

19:22.105 --> 19:24.656
You are one complicated dude.

19:24.658 --> 19:28.109
Pick up, borscht.

19:31.280 --> 19:34.465
- Unbelievable.
- What?

19:36.886 --> 19:38.887
Hey.
How you guys doin'?

19:38.889 --> 19:40.889
Cute strokes tee.

19:40.891 --> 19:43.624
Probably look better on me,
considering it's mine.

19:43.626 --> 19:48.479
You snooze, you lose, <i>puta.</i>

19:48.481 --> 19:51.132
Nice language!

19:51.134 --> 19:55.853
You kiss your obviously closeted
boyfriend with that mouth?

19:55.855 --> 19:58.773
You know what?
I wouldn't even want it now.

19:58.775 --> 19:59.857
Now that it's been on you,

19:59.859 --> 20:01.776
might as well have been
a Kenny G shirt.

20:04.414 --> 20:07.532
And now I walk.

20:07.534 --> 20:09.317
You can't just let her win.

20:09.319 --> 20:11.002
Oh, forget it, it's over.

20:11.004 --> 20:13.571
Borscht!
Pick up, pick up.

20:20.079 --> 20:21.212
Hi, I'll be right with you.

20:21.214 --> 20:22.880
Oh!

20:22.882 --> 20:24.432
- <i>Idiota!</i>
- Oh.

20:24.434 --> 20:27.885
<i>Esta camiseta</i>
<i>me costo cuatro dolares!</i>

20:27.887 --> 20:29.337
<i>Te voy a cortar.</i>

20:29.339 --> 20:33.674
<i>Lo siento.</i>
<i>Todo es mi culpa.</i>

20:33.676 --> 20:36.311
I'm still a little clumsy,
it's my first week.

20:36.313 --> 20:38.896
I'll bring you some soda water,
but seriously,

20:38.898 --> 20:42.700
your boyfriend will come out
before that borscht stain does.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.457
That was awesome.

20:49.459 --> 20:51.459
Yeah.
I kinda just do stuff.

20:51.461 --> 20:56.030
Like I just did, while you were
standing there watching me.

20:56.032 --> 20:59.050
Thanks, gir-r-rlfriend.

20:59.052 --> 21:00.084
Oh.

21:00.086 --> 21:01.219
What, is she coming for me?

21:01.221 --> 21:03.004
Run.
