00:03.878 --> 00:14.055
*

00:26.067 --> 00:27.402
(knocking)

00:31.281 --> 00:33.199
Buenos dias!
(gasping)

00:33.241 --> 00:36.453
Don't tell me you fell
asleep in here again.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.788
How long has it been since you
actually put on your pajamas

00:38.830 --> 00:40.040
and slept in your bed?

00:40.081 --> 00:42.542
You truly are a godsend.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.210
I'm serious, Charlotte.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.130
You can't live like this,
it's not healthy.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.591
Well, I don't have
time to sleep, okay?

00:49.632 --> 00:51.384
Sales are slowing down.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.261
I have to create
a new collection quick

00:53.303 --> 00:56.222
before everyone just forgets
about Alistair altogether.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.475
Every luxury brand is
slowing down right now.

00:58.516 --> 00:59.768
It's inflation.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.644
Prices are too high for people.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.938
But that doesn't change the fact
that I haven't created anything

01:03.980 --> 01:05.774
new or worthwhile since April.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.402
Well, it's probably very hard
to get inspired when you

01:09.444 --> 01:12.155
don't go out and socialize
with humans every now and then.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.948
Hey, I socialize.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.200
I talk to you every day.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.160
I'm your seamstress.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.454
You literally pay me
to talk to you every day.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.957
Are you sure there
is nothing in here?

01:22.999 --> 01:24.584
Nothing.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.545
Everything I draw looks more
like lounge wear than luxury.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.173
There is nothing
wrong with lounge wear.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.217
There is when you
own a luxury boutique

01:32.258 --> 01:34.302
and you pride
yourself on exclusive

01:34.344 --> 01:35.929
and cutting edge clothing.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.181
Point taken.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.474
Shall we go open?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.937
Uh, change first, please,
before we go downstairs.

01:43.978 --> 01:54.155
*

02:01.162 --> 02:04.708
Did you get more silk,
by the way?

02:04.749 --> 02:07.544
I need to make more of
those gold tunic pieces.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.130
Unfortunately,
the price went up, 120 a yard.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.966
120? Are you kidding?

02:13.008 --> 02:15.010
That's going to put us
way over budget.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.678
The cost of being
a luxury designer.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.140
Not to mention the rent's
going up in January.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.808
Do you have to leave me
for two whole weeks?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.978
Yes. Some people spend their
holidays with their families.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.480
It's a very strange concept,
I know.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.107
(phone ringing)

02:29.149 --> 02:30.775
Speaking of which.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.776
(phone ringing)

02:33.737 --> 02:35.155
Hi, Mom.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.823
Mom:
Oh, Charlie. You picked up.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.199
What's up?
Is everything okay?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.369
Oh, everything's fine.
It's great, actually.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.580
Christina and Peter's place
is still under renovation,

02:43.621 --> 02:46.583
so they're going to be staying
here until the new year now.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.336
(chuckling) It's going to be
a full house for the holidays.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.755
Yeah, sounds cozy.

02:51.796 --> 02:55.467
So, if you have time in
your busy schedule to come by

02:55.508 --> 02:58.178
for a night or two,
we thought it would be really

02:58.219 --> 03:00.638
special for us
all to be together.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.060
Maybe watch some movies,
play some games, like old times.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.604
Mom, you know I'd love to,
but I'm just too busy right now.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.189
I need to be here
to man the store.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.025
Mom: You can't close
for a few days?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.818
Mom, we've talked
about this.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.653
If I close the store then
I could miss a customer,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.697
and every customer
matters right now.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.949
I know, I know.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.576
I just thought I'd try.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.578
Would have been so nice
for us all to be together

03:23.620 --> 03:26.206
for the last year
of Elfcapades.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.333
I know.
Maybe next year.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.127
Wait. Did you say the last year
of the Elfcapades?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.504
Mm-hm.
I thought I told you.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.714
What-- No, why is it
the last year?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.965
Dee Dee?

03:36.007 --> 03:37.050
Charlie.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.176
Tell her I said hi.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.219
Rick says hi.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.762
Honey, I've gotta go.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.890
Rick and I are going
cross-country skiing.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.268
Please, just think about
making the trip, okay?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.229
I'll make your
favorite ginger loaf.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.356
(chuckling)
Maybe next year.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.233
I'll talk to you later.
Love you.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.484
Mom:
Love you too, Char.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.238
What?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.739
You're seriously not
going home for Christmas

03:59.781 --> 04:02.492
because you're afraid you're
going to miss a customer?

04:02.534 --> 04:05.412
You do realize 80% of our sales
come from the website, right?

04:05.453 --> 04:08.039
Well, someone has to
be here for the other 20.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.250
(scoffs)
Is there some other reason

04:10.291 --> 04:11.418
you're avoiding going home

04:11.459 --> 04:13.378
or you're just
a complete Scrooge?

04:13.420 --> 04:16.172
I'm not a Scrooge.
I'm just focused.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.008
I have worked really
hard for 10 years

04:18.049 --> 04:19.384
trying to put
Alistair on the map.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.885
- I'm not slowing down now.
- (shop bell dings)

04:20.927 --> 04:22.345
If you say so.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.890
If you'll excuse me,
I have a customer to attend to.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.142
Hi, welcome to Alistair.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.685
Is there anything
I can help you with?

04:28.727 --> 04:38.695
*

04:58.340 --> 05:00.091
(pipes rattling)

05:03.303 --> 05:06.097
Great. Just great.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.059
No water.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.479
*

05:12.520 --> 05:15.190
Yes, we're hoping to have
a spring collection ready

05:15.231 --> 05:17.901
for New York Fashion Week
in February.

05:17.942 --> 05:21.488
Absolutely, yeah.
We'll work right on that.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.991
Uh, can I call you
right back?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.911
- (water dripping)
- Margo: Charlotte, finally.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.829
Wh-- What is happening here?

05:31.539 --> 05:32.499
Uh--

05:34.376 --> 05:36.503
Why are my garments
completely drenched?

05:36.544 --> 05:38.588
A pipe burst.
It's an old building.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.006
It was bound to happen.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.966
"Bound to happen?"

05:42.008 --> 05:43.426
This is my livelihood.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.637
I need to sell these
in order to pay you rent.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.389
Well, don't you have
any extras in the back?

05:47.430 --> 05:50.600
Extras?
No, we are a boutique.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.895
Each garment is hand-stitched
and one-of-a-kind.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.146
That's not very efficient.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.607
(sighing)
This is a disaster.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.609
How long is this
going to take to clean up?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.277
Well, the plumber said
there's significant damage,

06:01.319 --> 06:03.530
so you're gonna have to close up
and leave for the next week

06:03.571 --> 06:04.698
so I can take care of it.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.200
A week?
Are you kidding me?

06:07.242 --> 06:09.035
Do I look
like I'm kidding you?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.287
Wh-- Where am I
supposed to go?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.373
Well, don't you have friends
and family you can stay with?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.083
What about staying with Margo?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.251
I'm renting out
my place while me

06:16.292 --> 06:18.420
and my family are in Colorado.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.879
Sorry, Charlotte,
but unless you want to live

06:19.921 --> 06:22.257
in a place with no running
water for the next week,

06:22.298 --> 06:23.216
you better figure it out.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.634
(sighing)

06:26.261 --> 06:27.637
It's ruined.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.432
- (thudding)
- (gasping)

06:31.766 --> 06:33.143
Sorry.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.603
(whirring)

06:35.645 --> 06:37.605
- (sighing)
- (turning off hairdryer)

06:37.647 --> 06:39.733
I'm so sorry, Charlotte.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.776
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.279
I don't have the money
to replace all this fabric.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.364
This is a catastrophe.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.574
We'll figure it out.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.120
I don't know if Alistair's
going to bounce back from this.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.831
Come on, we just have to
pray for a Christmas miracle.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.541
Aren't you Jewish?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.711
Okay, fine.
A Hanukkah miracle.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.172
Either way,
I believe in miracles,

07:02.213 --> 07:03.631
especially this time
of year.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.091
Well, that makes one of us.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.551
(phone ringing)

07:06.593 --> 07:08.511
Oh, maybe this
is the insurance.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.097
Hello.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.140
Yes, this is her.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.143
Uh-huh.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.062
Wait. What?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.438
Warwick's Christmas Challenge?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.857
But I never applied--

07:25.445 --> 07:28.156
Tomorrow? Uh, yes.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.075
Two o'clock?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.243
Okay, great.
Thank you.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.456
Did you submit Alistair for

07:36.498 --> 07:38.124
the Warwick's Christmas
Design Challenge?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.668
Did you just get accepted?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.378
They said one of their
designers had to drop out

07:41.419 --> 07:44.756
for personal reasons so they're
looking at me to fill the spot.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.925
I have a meeting with
Roger Warwick tomorrow

07:46.966 --> 07:48.218
to discuss details.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.178
- What?
- (laughing)

07:50.220 --> 07:51.471
That's amazing!

07:51.513 --> 07:53.973
You could be
the next Donna Karan.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.184
I can't believe you
applied without telling me!

07:56.226 --> 07:59.771
I knew the word "Christmas"
would turn you off.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.315
You're so talented,
Charlotte.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.734
The world deserves
to see what you can do.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.529
Christmas garb or otherwise.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.657
Roger: We loved your brand
right from the get-go.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.910
Fabulous designs,
great social media.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.121
The reason we didn't
choose you right away

08:16.162 --> 08:19.207
is that we felt your design
style just didn't match

08:19.249 --> 08:20.417
this year's challenge.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.419
Oh?

08:22.460 --> 08:24.504
Why? What is the challenge
this year?

08:24.546 --> 08:27.674
It's to design
two holiday outfits.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.968
One for a female buyer,
one for a male buyer.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.386
It's for our home
and family brand.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.138
Home and family?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.099
Yeah, it's actually our most
popular clothing division.

08:36.141 --> 08:39.519
It's affordable,
it's inclusive, family-oriented.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.147
But I design luxury pieces.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.024
Exactly.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.817
We thought you might
actually bring something special

08:45.859 --> 08:47.110
to this year's challenge.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.987
How much time would I have?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.614
So, we do a fashion show
Christmas Eve.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.658
Wow, that's, uh...

08:53.700 --> 08:55.368
that's eight days away.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.705
It is, and,
as you know,

08:58.747 --> 09:01.833
the winner gets their design
sold in all of our stores

09:01.875 --> 09:04.627
right across the nation,
as well,

09:04.669 --> 09:06.588
you continue to design for us
for the entire year.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
- Wow, really?
- Mm-hm.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.550
That's incredible.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.719
So, the only question is...

09:12.761 --> 09:15.096
are you up
for the challenge?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.557
Because there's a lot of other
designers here in New York City

09:17.599 --> 09:19.017
that would love to be
sitting in your seat.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.478
Uh, no.
I-- I'm definitely interested.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.854
Roger:
Fantastic.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.607
Here are the models
that we will be designing for,

09:25.648 --> 09:28.651
and their specs are on
the back of the picture.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.488
Well, great.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.114
Thank you so much.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.449
I will not disappoint.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.368
Nice to meet you,
and we'll see you Christmas Eve.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.619
Excellent.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.662
Thank you.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.375
Margo:
Home and family.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.834
Wow, that's huge.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.920
I know, but he says
he needs the designs

09:46.961 --> 09:51.758
to be festive, inclusive,
affordable, and family-oriented.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.761
So, Alistair's polar opposite.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.098
Yup, but winning this
competition

09:58.139 --> 10:00.642
would push my career to
a whole new level.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.104
I'll design baby bonnets.
I am desperate for a win.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.357
I'm so sorry.
I can't even help you sew.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.193
Oh, that's okay. I only
have to design two outfits.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.778
I think I can manage.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.780
So, when are
you going home?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.407
What do you mean?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.992
What do you mean
what do I mean?

10:18.034 --> 10:20.245
You're not planning on staying
here without water, are you?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.622
Well, no, but--

10:22.664 --> 10:24.332
Uh, but what, Charlotte?

10:24.374 --> 10:28.211
You're designing Christmas
attire for home and family.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.005
Don't you think it
might be beneficial

10:30.046 --> 10:33.299
to go spend Christmas
at home with your family?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.300
It's just--

10:34.342 --> 10:37.012
It's just what?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.598
You're right.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.728
I can't afford an AirBnB at
this time of year anyway. So...

10:46.229 --> 10:47.689
Brooksbend it is, I guess.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.524
Hallelujah!

10:49.566 --> 10:51.317
This will be
so good for you.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.527
I just know it.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.737
Mm-hm.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.991
Radio Host #1: You know,
this might be my favorite night

10:58.033 --> 10:59.534
of Elfcapades.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.494
I mean, cookies, hot chocolate,
Christmas carols. Come on.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.787
Radio Host #2: Right.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.664
My kids are really gonna
miss it next year.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.624
Radio Host #1:
Oh, tell me about it.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.793
I guess we'll just have to go
all out for the next seven days

11:08.835 --> 11:10.420
and make
Gregory Carmichael proud.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.504
Radio Host #2:
Here, here!

11:11.546 --> 11:13.381
Radio Host #1:
Okay, let's do it.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.549
- (gasping)
- (tires squealing)

11:14.591 --> 11:15.967
(smashing)

11:17.260 --> 11:18.303
(sighing)

11:28.229 --> 11:30.774
I am so sorry. I--

11:30.815 --> 11:33.735
I was completely daydreaming
and not paying attention.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.697
That's not ideal when you're
behind the wheel of a vehicle.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.866
I know. I'm a little
out of sorts today.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.535
I've been driving the past
four hours from Manhattan.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.455
Ah, city girl.
That explains it.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.248
What's that supposed
to mean?

11:47.290 --> 11:48.583
Were you texting?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.293
What?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.504
No. Stereotype much?

11:54.089 --> 11:56.049
Well, lucky for you
mine's okay.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.176
So, you're just going to have
to worry about your own there.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.137
Oh, come on.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.138
Oh!

12:04.349 --> 12:06.142
Well, that's a great start.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.269
(sighing)

12:08.311 --> 12:09.896
Tell you what.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.272
Why don't you
follow me to my shop

12:11.314 --> 12:13.024
and I'll take care of it?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.734
Your shop?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.695
I'm a mechanic.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.447
Oh, and here I was
thinking your coveralls

12:19.489 --> 12:20.907
was a personal
fashion choice.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.911
Follow me
and I'll take you home after.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.538
I got this.
Here. Just watch out.

12:26.579 --> 12:36.548
*

12:47.434 --> 12:49.144
I remember this place.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.563
This used to be
Joe Segal's right?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.107
Uh, you know, I don't know.
It was vacant when I got here.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.859
I'm actually new
to Brooksbend.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.320
Oh, wow. So, you actually
chose to live here.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.032
Why?

13:02.073 --> 13:05.952
Because it's so welcoming
and homey.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.954
Everyone here is really
family and community focused.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.457
People have been
so kind to me.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.375
I can't imagine why
anyone would want to leave.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.627
Mm.
Three words for you.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.755
New York City.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.631
Two words for you.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.383
Hard pass.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.093
Hm.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.304
Besides, bet the city doesn't
have twelve days of Elfcapades.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.680
You ever heard of it?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.223
I grew up going.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.725
Really?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.061
I'm actually volunteering with
the Elfcapades this year.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.481
Are you on probation?

13:34.522 --> 13:38.360
No, I-- I just like how
it brings people together.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.694
(snorting)

13:39.736 --> 13:41.363
What?

13:41.404 --> 13:45.200
Nothing. Just sounds like you're
on an after-school special.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.369
Wow.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.579
You're really defying
the whole cold-hearted

13:49.621 --> 13:52.207
city slicker
stereotype here.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, it's not
my thing anymore.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.670
It's a little
too much... Christmas.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.797
That's sort of the point.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.508
Well, as much fun
as this is,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.969
we should get going before my
mom sends out the authorities.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.930
Right, yeah.
Let's get you home.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.264
Just have to get my bag.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.265
Oh, okay, yeah.

14:09.307 --> 14:19.275
*

14:25.073 --> 14:27.534
Thank you for the ride.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.868
Yeah, no problem.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.745
And how long do you think
the repairs will take?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.455
Oh, it'll just
take a couple days.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.624
Thank you, uh...

14:34.666 --> 14:35.709
Spencer.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.502
- Spencer.
- Yeah.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.545
Right.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.131
Well, merry Christmas.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.515
Hello?

14:51.933 --> 14:54.310
Mom? Christina?

14:55.937 --> 14:59.107
Oh, Charlie. You're here!
You're really here.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.817
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- (laughing)

15:00.859 --> 15:02.610
Is it really you?

15:02.652 --> 15:05.196
Well, I'm not an apparition,
so I think it's really me.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.490
Aw, you look tired.
Are you getting enough sleep?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.908
Yes, I'm fine, Mom.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.035
Auntie Charlie!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.203
Hey, buddy.
Look at you.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.080
You're so tall.
How did that happen?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.582
Oh, it's called
the passage of time.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.334
And I eat a lot
of broccoli.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.626
That, too.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.878
- Hi, Chris.
- Come here.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.129
Char, it's great
to see you,

15:21.171 --> 15:22.922
but I had 10 bucks down
that you wouldn't show.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.175
I appreciate that,
Pete, thank you.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.510
Okay, who's ready to go?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.845
Me, me, me!

15:28.887 --> 15:30.638
Charlotte, hi.
Welcome home.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.140
Uh, where are you going?

15:32.182 --> 15:34.434
Well, Elfcapades, silly.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.770
It's the cookie
and cocoa crawl tonight!

15:36.811 --> 15:38.104
Dee Dee's is our first stop.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.231
Oh, well,
you guys have fun.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.941
I have to unpack
and start sketching,

15:41.983 --> 15:43.276
but we'll catch up tomorrow.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.611
What? Come on.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.404
This was always your
favorite of the Elfcapades.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.324
I know, but I have
a lot of work to do.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.951
This opportunity I have with
Warwick's is once in a lifetime.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.745
So, I'm sorry.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.915
So, you came all this way to
just keep ignoring us for work?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.625
Christina.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.670
You sure you're just not
scared of bumping into Evan?

16:01.711 --> 16:03.546
I told you not
to bring that up.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.882
Peter: I can throw him out
if he's there.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.176
Ben and I just got
our blue belts in karate.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.386
Hiya!

16:09.427 --> 16:10.345
(laughing)

16:10.387 --> 16:11.429
Wah!

16:11.471 --> 16:12.806
Well, that's very
nice of you guys,

16:12.847 --> 16:14.224
but it's been four years.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.725
I think I can handle
seeing him.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.603
Well, it would really mean
a lot if you came, Charlie.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.896
Even just for an hour.

16:19.938 --> 16:20.980
(sighing)

16:21.022 --> 16:22.649
Please, Auntie Charlie?

16:22.691 --> 16:24.150
(groaning)

16:25.527 --> 16:28.154
All right, just give me
a minute to unpack.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.280
Yay!

16:29.322 --> 16:38.289
*

16:39.874 --> 16:42.711
Thanks for coming,
and merry Christmas.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.295
(chuckling)

16:47.799 --> 16:49.009
Dee Dee?

16:49.050 --> 16:52.470
Well, look at all
these wonderful faces.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.974
And you,
I feel like we've met before.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.100
Mm...

16:57.142 --> 16:58.685
It's Aunt Charlie!

16:58.727 --> 17:00.395
Oh, my goodness.
Charlie.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.689
Hi, Aunt Dee Dee.

17:02.731 --> 17:06.276
I spy some gingerbread
cookies at two o'clock.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.527
Get 'em
while they're hot.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.987
Cookies!

17:09.029 --> 17:11.865
Welcome home, kiddo.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.867
Oh, it's been
way too long.

17:13.908 --> 17:16.619
This is a great turnout.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.413
You know,
I wasn't sure what to expect,

17:18.455 --> 17:20.540
but so many people
are still participating.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.251
It just keeps growing,
year after year.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.211
Your dad would be delighted.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.130
But then why
is it ending?

17:27.172 --> 17:30.008
The town decided to
take back the funding.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.092
I tried to stop them,

17:31.134 --> 17:32.427
but they had
their minds made up.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.137
Something to do with
allocating the money

17:34.179 --> 17:35.430
to a new community project.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.515
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.893
I mean, people love it.
It's tradition.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.103
My dad wanted
it to keep going.

17:42.145 --> 17:47.067
I know. We'll have to find
a new way to honor him.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.778
Charlotte Carmichael.
Oh, my God.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.946
I haven't
seen you in ages, girl.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.115
Oh, Gwen, hi!

17:54.157 --> 17:56.743
Can you believe that
it has been 10 years

17:56.785 --> 17:58.078
since we graduated
high school?

17:58.119 --> 18:00.121
God, it feels
just like yesterday

18:00.163 --> 18:03.249
we were roaming
around the hallways, huh?

18:03.291 --> 18:05.585
O-M-G. He's here.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.920
How does my hair look?

18:06.961 --> 18:08.088
Uh, wha-- Who's here?

18:08.129 --> 18:10.423
Oh, my God.
Is my make-up okay?

18:10.465 --> 18:12.175
How's my breath?
(blowing)

18:12.217 --> 18:14.135
Uh it's very minty.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.763
But who are you--

18:16.805 --> 18:18.682
- You.
- You.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.558
Hi, Spencer.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.521
Um, can I get you a cookie
or a beverage?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.606
Uh, I'm okay right now,
but thank you.

18:26.648 --> 18:30.527
Okay. If you need anything,
just ask.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.988
I'm, uh,
happy to be of service.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.282
I will, yeah.
For sure. Thank you.

18:39.994 --> 18:44.374
Uh, well,
that was... interesting.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.126
Every single woman
in town is after him.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.379
Wow. Lucky you.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.006
Have you decided who
you're going to give

18:51.047 --> 18:53.466
the final rose
of the night to?

18:53.508 --> 18:55.135
(chuckling)

18:55.176 --> 18:56.678
What can I help you
with tonight, Dee?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.180
Well, you can either
help serve with Gwen,

18:59.222 --> 19:01.558
or decorate a new
batch in the back.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.684
Up to you, doll.

19:03.852 --> 19:04.811
I'll be in the back.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.188
Pleasure as always.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.984
How do you two
know each other?

19:11.026 --> 19:12.318
I hit him with my car today.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.404
That's one way
to meet new people.

19:14.446 --> 19:17.657
I'm gonna slip into the back.
Make yourself at home.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.700
Thanks, Dee.

19:21.786 --> 19:22.787
Ugh.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.835
Uh...

19:28.877 --> 19:33.840
*

19:33.882 --> 19:34.841
Oh.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.552
(clearing throat)

19:37.594 --> 19:38.845
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.096
(sighing)

19:40.138 --> 19:41.806
Ghost of Christmas Past
to be specific.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.516
An ex?

19:43.558 --> 19:45.101
Ding-ding.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.145
Mm. Yeah, that's one of
the drawbacks

19:47.187 --> 19:48.104
about being in a small town.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.481
One of many.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.193
Here.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.486
Take your mind off it.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.366
Surprised to see you here.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.201
Thought Christmas
wasn't your thing.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.828
Well, it's important
to my family.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.081
My dad was actually the one
who started the Elfcapades

20:06.122 --> 20:08.208
30 years ago.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.126
You're kidding.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.420
Your dad
was Gregory Carmichael?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.380
Mm-hm.

20:14.673 --> 20:17.384
Well, that would make
you Dee Dee's niece.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.094
You're the-- the one
she's always talking about.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.512
The big fashion
designer in New York.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.473
(chuckling) I don't know
about a big fashion designer,

20:23.515 --> 20:25.433
but it's getting there.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.935
I'm actually a contestant

20:26.976 --> 20:28.520
in the Warwick's Design
Christmas Challenge this year,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.897
and if I win they're
going to sell my designs

20:30.939 --> 20:32.857
in all
their department stores.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.110
Wow, that's a big deal.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.319
Even I know Warwick's.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.239
The only problem is
is I have one week

20:39.280 --> 20:41.408
to design
two holiday garments.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.742
It's just not enough time.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.828
Eh, you can do it.

20:44.869 --> 20:48.748
You have no idea how hard it is
to design an original garment,

20:48.790 --> 20:50.417
especially one
that needs to be festive

20:50.458 --> 20:52.752
and appeal to
the average man slash woman.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.379
It's completely
out of my comfort zone.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.797
I don't even know
where to start.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.759
I do. Here.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.302
The Elfcapades.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.472
There's all the festive
inspiration you could hope for,

21:04.514 --> 21:06.307
and, from what I can tell,

21:06.349 --> 21:09.102
everyone who attends is
super family-focused.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.604
Yeah, especially all the single
women when they look at you.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.441
Talk about being
outside your comfort zone.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.110
I'm not really looking
to be dating right now.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.445
You and me both.

21:18.486 --> 21:22.949
*

21:22.991 --> 21:24.534
What?

21:24.576 --> 21:28.663
Why don't you come with me
to the rest of the Elfcapades?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.957
You can get
all the inspiration you need

21:30.999 --> 21:35.003
for your Warwick design
and you could be my buffer.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.590
Buffer? Really?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.134
What are you 15?
It can't be that bad.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.302
- Come on--
- Spencer!

21:42.344 --> 21:44.471
There you are.
What are you doing?

21:45.597 --> 21:47.057
Just doing a new batch
for Dee Dee.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.642
Okay, well, hurry up.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.812
Someone found a mistletoe
with your name on it.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.981
Um...

21:55.023 --> 21:56.649
Yeah, he might be a while.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.485
He is a really
slow decorator.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.738
No rush.

22:01.780 --> 22:02.864
We'll be waiting.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.785
(chuckling)

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
Wow.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.455
Okay, you weren't lying.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.873
Please come with me.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.291
(laughing)

22:13.333 --> 22:15.085
Okay, hear me out.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.795
I will go to
the Elfcapades with you

22:16.836 --> 22:19.506
if you will be
my personal model.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.636
Personal model?
What does that mean?

22:24.678 --> 22:27.097
Well, you're about the same
size as the model that

22:27.138 --> 22:28.723
I have to design
an outfit for

22:28.765 --> 22:31.101
for the Christmas Eve Fashion
Show in New York,

22:31.142 --> 22:33.353
and it would really help me
to have a real person

22:33.395 --> 22:36.272
to try on the designs,
see how they fit and look.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.317
So, basically you want me
to be a mannequin?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.527
Exactly.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.863
That feels degrading somehow.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.866
Oh, and using me as
your personal buffer isn't?

22:48.118 --> 22:49.411
Good point.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.248
So, we have a deal?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.000
Fine.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.255
My cookies look so cute.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.798
Not as cute as mine.
Look at this guy.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.049
Cute as a button.

23:06.803 --> 23:15.562
*

23:15.603 --> 23:17.939
Yeah, I-- I cannot believe
you're doing the rest

23:17.981 --> 23:21.693
of Elfcapades to help some
random mechanic you just met,

23:21.735 --> 23:23.903
and when I ask
it's like pulling teeth.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.614
Well, it's not just to help him,
I mean, he has a point.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.575
It might inspire
my Warwick's design,

23:28.616 --> 23:30.910
'cause as of now,
I have nothing.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.287
What's that?

23:32.328 --> 23:34.539
It's a snow angel silk dress.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.625
Word of advice?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.795
Nix the silk.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.549
Christmas attire should be
warm and cozy, not slippery.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.176
Well, what do you suggest?

23:46.217 --> 23:48.303
I don't know.
Cotton?

23:48.345 --> 23:50.764
Cotton?
That's so simple.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.892
Christmastime
should feel simple.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.645
Two hot coffees and some fresh
gingerbread cookies.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.356
- Thanks, Aunt Dee Dee.
- Thanks, Aunt Dee Dee.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.483
I must say, Charlie,
I haven't seen your mum

24:01.524 --> 24:04.152
this excited in years.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.780
Having you home for
Christmas is the best gift

24:06.821 --> 24:07.989
she ever could have
asked for.

24:08.031 --> 24:11.284
Yeah, well,
I have a pretty busy week,

24:11.326 --> 24:13.244
so I hope expectations
aren't too high.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.706
We'll try
to keep them at bay.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.875
Wow.

24:19.876 --> 24:20.919
What?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.046
You're a real ball
of holiday cheer.

24:25.382 --> 24:28.176
You used to love
this time of year.

24:28.218 --> 24:32.013
Yeah, well, things change.

24:32.055 --> 24:42.023
*

24:42.065 --> 24:43.024
(sighing)

24:58.540 --> 24:59.874
(knocking)

24:59.916 --> 25:01.710
Lasagna's ready.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.962
Can you take a break?

25:04.004 --> 25:05.380
Come eat with us.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.258
I don't think so. I--

25:08.299 --> 25:10.427
I have a lot of
work to do still.

25:10.468 --> 25:11.594
Maybe tomorrow night?

25:11.636 --> 25:15.098
'Kay.
Well, don't work too hard.

25:17.392 --> 25:24.733
*

25:24.774 --> 25:26.943
Man on megaphone: Welcome to
the Elfcapades Night Market!

25:26.985 --> 25:29.571
Don't forget
your hot chocolate!

25:29.612 --> 25:32.907
Okay, so, I see
garlands with tinsel.

25:32.949 --> 25:33.825
Mm-hm.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.785
Twinkly lights.
Candy canes.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.203
Mm-hm.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.747
Anything jumping out
at you?

25:38.788 --> 25:39.831
(Christmas music playing
in background)

25:39.873 --> 25:41.833
Besides a sea
of people

25:41.875 --> 25:44.252
with very questionable
fashion sense?

25:44.294 --> 25:46.921
Wow.
Judgmental much?

25:46.963 --> 25:48.423
I'm sorry,
but in New York City

25:48.465 --> 25:50.342
if you wear
pajamas pants out in public,

25:50.383 --> 25:52.802
it is a very serious offence.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.222
I think it's endearing.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.932
Coming from a guy
who wears onesie every day,

25:57.974 --> 25:59.559
I wouldn't expect
anything else.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.270
It's not a onesie.
They are coveralls.

26:02.312 --> 26:04.230
Whatever.
Same thing.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.273
Come on.

26:06.775 --> 26:09.319
There is Christmas
inspiration everywhere.

26:09.361 --> 26:12.405
Try to use that to
your advantage

26:12.447 --> 26:14.908
rather than focus
on the negatives.

26:14.949 --> 26:15.992
Fine.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.455
(sighing)
Isn't this great?

26:20.497 --> 26:22.415
Everyone's out,
away from their screens,

26:22.457 --> 26:24.042
enjoying the magic
of the season.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.170
You really love Christmas,
don't you?

26:28.546 --> 26:31.424
You and my dad would
have been... best buds.

26:31.466 --> 26:32.926
I don't know. I just think
there's something special

26:32.967 --> 26:34.177
in the air this time of year.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.931
Oh, no.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.516
You're not one of
those lunatics that

26:39.557 --> 26:41.434
decorates in early November,
are you?

26:44.145 --> 26:45.939
November first,

26:45.980 --> 26:49.776
my wife and I, we would go nuts
and decorate the whole house.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.319
Our neighbors
thought we were crazy.

26:52.654 --> 26:53.822
You were married?

26:56.700 --> 26:57.867
Her name was Laura.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.579
She got sick
a few years back.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.914
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.670
I'm so sorry.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.839
That is awful.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.718
That's why I decided
to move to this place.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.513
Leave the past
in the past.

27:18.555 --> 27:22.809
*

27:22.851 --> 27:26.896
Don't you find it hard to
celebrate Christmas without her?

27:28.064 --> 27:28.982
Yeah.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.944
But I don't think
she would want me to avoid it

27:32.986 --> 27:35.405
just because she's not here.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.034
I don't know.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.495
Oh, man. She would have
loved the Elfcapades.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.626
Son of a... snowman!
Go, go, go!

27:48.668 --> 27:49.878
What are you doing?

27:49.919 --> 27:51.838
Oh, my gosh.
That's my ex over there.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.216
Being in this town is
like living in a snow globe.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.551
Where is he?

27:56.593 --> 27:58.011
Green coat, red hat.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.556
Evan Miller?

28:01.598 --> 28:02.599
(shushing)

28:02.640 --> 28:03.933
Is-- Isn't he the mayor?

28:03.975 --> 28:05.894
Brooksbend's youngest
mayor ever elected.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.563
What is he doing?
Who is he with?

28:08.605 --> 28:10.774
Are they holding hands?

28:10.815 --> 28:13.485
Did you guys, like,
just break up or something?

28:13.526 --> 28:14.903
Four years ago.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.031
You okay?

28:18.073 --> 28:20.909
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.703
It's not like
we were engaged or anything.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.998
Engaged? Really?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.376
Broke up with me
two months after my dad...

28:31.461 --> 28:33.630
He said he was...

28:33.672 --> 28:36.049
He said he needed space
and he was sick

28:36.091 --> 28:38.176
of taking the train to New York
every other weekend.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.097
He abandoned me
when I needed him most.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.932
Sounds like you
dodged a bullet.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.061
Hey, let's get out of here.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.479
To where?

28:49.521 --> 28:51.731
Christmas village where
we have to dress up like elves

28:51.773 --> 28:53.024
and prance around?

28:53.066 --> 28:56.319
I know a spot.
Come on. Go. Go, go.

28:57.696 --> 29:02.325
(band playing)

29:02.367 --> 29:04.285
(laughing)
What?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.874
Oh!

29:09.916 --> 29:11.960
Why am I so bad at this?

29:12.002 --> 29:14.170
It's okay, you just...

29:14.212 --> 29:16.006
you just gotta focus,
all right?

29:18.008 --> 29:21.344
Really focus, and don't let
the outside world distract you.

29:21.386 --> 29:24.139
Well, it's hard to not let all
this flannel obscure my vision.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.475
Hey, watch it. Flannel is
the greatest fabric on earth.

29:27.517 --> 29:28.518
(groaning)

29:30.854 --> 29:32.897
- (groaning)
- Wow.

29:32.939 --> 29:33.940
Yeah, you're terrible.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.943
Hey!
(chuckling)

29:36.985 --> 29:38.361
Thank you
for bringing me here.

29:38.403 --> 29:42.323
The Christmas Market has
a lot of memories attached.

29:42.365 --> 29:45.827
Sometimes it's hard for me
to be home this time of year.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.620
You said it yourself,
you know?

29:47.662 --> 29:49.539
Sometimes it's best to
leave the past in the past.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.587
(scoffing)

29:55.628 --> 29:57.881
How are you
so good at this?

29:57.922 --> 29:59.424
All right, just...

29:59.466 --> 30:01.092
picture Evan's face.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.219
- Come on.
- Trust me, it works.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.017
Spencer:
Oh!

30:09.059 --> 30:11.603
- (laughing)
- See? I told you it works!

30:11.644 --> 30:14.856
Wow! I actually pictured
your face, hope that's okay.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.150
- Whatever gets you through.
- (laughing)

30:19.027 --> 30:20.904
I'm really sorry
about your wife, Spencer.

30:22.113 --> 30:23.365
I'm sorry about your dad.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.076
Woman: Hi, Spencer.
(giggling)

30:30.997 --> 30:33.667
Wow, you really are
the Clooney of Brooksbend.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.211
(laughing)

30:36.252 --> 30:38.463
Don't get weird about
what I'm about to do.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.923
What are you doing?

30:39.964 --> 30:42.425
Getting them to
mind their own business.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.551
Just look me in the eyes.

30:45.595 --> 30:52.769
*

30:52.811 --> 30:56.272
Um, there you go.
(laughing)

30:56.314 --> 30:57.440
Yes, uh...

30:57.482 --> 30:58.733
I should get home.

30:58.775 --> 31:00.443
I have some sketches to do.

31:00.485 --> 31:01.820
Of course, right.

31:01.861 --> 31:02.904
- Um, yeah.
- I got this, I got this.

31:02.946 --> 31:03.947
Oh, thank you so much.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.281
Here, let me help you
with this.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.839
Ben:
Wake up, Aunt Charlie!

31:20.880 --> 31:23.091
(groaning)
What the--

31:23.133 --> 31:24.300
Breakfast is ready!

31:24.342 --> 31:25.802
Okay.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.512
You know, I think I'm going to
skip breakfast today, Ben.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.180
Okay? I'll just make
a smoothie later.

31:29.222 --> 31:32.308
Well, Mom said that
if you said that,

31:32.350 --> 31:34.185
I was allowed
to jump on you.

31:34.227 --> 31:37.147
She said that?
Ugh!

31:37.188 --> 31:40.483
Oh. Not the phone, man.
Come on.

31:40.525 --> 31:43.486
Will you come
down for breakfast?

31:43.528 --> 31:44.988
Are you blackmailing me?

31:45.030 --> 31:46.823
I don't know
what that means.

31:46.865 --> 31:49.617
(sighing)
I will be down in a sec.

31:49.659 --> 31:51.828
Just give me a few
minutes to get ready, okay?

31:51.870 --> 31:53.246
Yay!

31:53.288 --> 31:54.873
Okay.
Eggs are ready.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.374
(talking over each other)

31:56.416 --> 32:00.462
Oh, look who it is.
How nice of you to join us.

32:00.503 --> 32:03.590
Yes, and thank you for
sending up the human torpedo.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.842
That is me!

32:05.884 --> 32:07.677
Let me pour you a coffee.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.054
No thanks.
I got it.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.017
So, we were hoping you might
be able to join us tonight

32:14.059 --> 32:15.435
for a Christmas-themed
games night.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.021
Oh, I would,
but I promised Spencer

32:18.063 --> 32:19.856
that I would go to
the Elfcapades with him.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.858
That is tonight's Elfcapades.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.443
What do you mean?

32:23.485 --> 32:26.863
Everyone's encouraged to play
a Christmas-themed games night

32:26.905 --> 32:27.864
with their family.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.783
So, you'll join us?

32:29.824 --> 32:32.369
Please, Aunt Charlie?

32:32.410 --> 32:35.955
Okay, sure, but I still
have a ton of work to do, so--

32:35.997 --> 32:38.208
However long we can have you,
we'll have you.

32:40.752 --> 32:41.836
Rick:
Was it something I said?

32:41.878 --> 32:43.088
Christina:
She just really misses dad.

32:43.129 --> 32:46.049
Okay, what do you
think about this?

32:46.091 --> 32:48.635
So, picture this silver
being extra shiny

32:48.677 --> 32:50.136
with tinsel-fringed sleeves.

32:55.809 --> 32:58.103
It kind of looks
like a disco ball.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.021
Okay.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.315
So, retro.
Retro is in.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.861
Dee, would you
come here a sec?

33:07.904 --> 33:10.073
So.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.242
Would you wear this?
With the tinsel?

33:13.243 --> 33:16.246
Honestly?
Probably not.

33:16.287 --> 33:19.541
Too flashy
for little old me.

33:19.582 --> 33:22.127
Well, what do you like to
wear during the holidays?

33:22.168 --> 33:25.255
Something simple
but comfortable.

33:25.296 --> 33:28.299
Modern, but also
traditional and classic,

33:28.341 --> 33:29.509
you know what I mean?

33:30.719 --> 33:32.137
I'm trying.

33:34.139 --> 33:36.558
This is useless.

33:36.599 --> 33:39.185
Modern, but also
traditional and classic?

33:39.227 --> 33:40.520
What does that even mean?

33:41.771 --> 33:43.148
(groaning)
I'm doomed.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.442
I think
I know what she means.

33:45.483 --> 33:47.402
You do?

33:47.444 --> 33:49.112
Mm-hm.

33:49.154 --> 33:51.322
Come with me.
I gotta show you something.

33:56.077 --> 34:03.126
*

34:03.168 --> 34:04.961
This is what she means.

34:05.003 --> 34:05.920
Come again?

34:07.297 --> 34:09.132
So, for the last two years,

34:09.174 --> 34:12.052
I've been restoring
this old car,

34:12.093 --> 34:15.555
finding parts, cleaning them,
adding my own unique touches,

34:15.597 --> 34:17.974
but making sure that
I protect all the things

34:18.016 --> 34:19.684
that make this car
so special.

34:19.726 --> 34:20.769
(chuckling)

34:20.810 --> 34:22.937
All right, come. Sit.

34:22.979 --> 34:32.947
*

34:36.618 --> 34:39.537
Wow.
This is really beautiful.

34:39.579 --> 34:40.372
- Right?
- Mm-hm.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.791
Here, feel the leather.

34:42.832 --> 34:44.167
Mm-hm.

34:44.209 --> 34:45.669
No, come on.
Really feel it.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.712
Close your eyes.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.005
Seriously?

34:49.047 --> 34:49.964
Humor me.

34:54.344 --> 34:56.513
Feel that?
All that history?

34:56.554 --> 34:57.889
Hm.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.350
This car was made for
the average American family.

35:02.310 --> 35:05.814
It's comfortable,
affordable.

35:05.855 --> 35:08.316
No frills, just classic.

35:08.358 --> 35:11.236
It's nostalgic,
but still contemporary.

35:14.823 --> 35:16.616
I think your design
could do the same.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.204
Too cheesy?

35:21.246 --> 35:24.374
No.
Not at all.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.377
You just made me
realize how much I miss that

35:27.419 --> 35:30.880
creative enthusiasm and passion
that you have for cars.

35:32.382 --> 35:35.218
I used to get
so excited

35:35.260 --> 35:37.762
to just sit
and sketch and sew.

35:37.804 --> 35:41.474
You know, before profits
or reviews mattered.

35:43.685 --> 35:47.480
I guess I just lost that
joy somewhere along the way.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.403
Well, this is a great
chance to get it back.

35:55.447 --> 35:57.782
What was your favorite
Christmas tradition growing up?

35:58.825 --> 35:59.993
I don't know.

36:00.035 --> 36:03.413
Probably throwing snowballs
at my sister.

36:03.455 --> 36:06.750
(laughing)
Come on, no. Seriously.

36:06.791 --> 36:09.753
What part of the holidays was
always the most magical to you?

36:12.881 --> 36:14.549
Probably the Pajamboree.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.093
Pajamboree?

36:17.135 --> 36:18.553
Yeah.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.389
It's the last event
of Elfcapades on Christmas Eve.

36:21.431 --> 36:26.227
People wear their pajamas
and there's music and dessert.

36:26.269 --> 36:28.772
And my dad would
always make homemade pizza

36:28.813 --> 36:32.734
before we'd all pile
into his tow truck and went.

36:32.776 --> 36:34.694
Your dad was
a tow truck driver?

36:36.446 --> 36:38.281
You weren't the only guy roaming
around town in coveralls.

36:38.323 --> 36:41.409
(both laughing)

36:41.451 --> 36:45.830
Anyway, that's what I looked
forward to the most.

36:48.124 --> 36:49.959
Pajamboree.

36:50.001 --> 36:51.086
- Hm.
- I love it.

36:54.214 --> 36:55.340
Wait.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.803
Why don't you design a pair
of pajamas for Warwick's?

36:59.844 --> 37:01.930
- Pajamas?
- Yeah!

37:01.971 --> 37:04.974
Everyone loves a new
pair of PJs at Christmas time.

37:08.478 --> 37:09.854
That's not
a bad idea, actually.

37:11.564 --> 37:12.941
In fact,
that's a great idea.

37:12.982 --> 37:14.317
Yeah?

37:14.359 --> 37:15.318
Definitely!

37:15.360 --> 37:17.946
It's genius!

37:17.987 --> 37:20.281
I'll design a matching pair
of holiday pajamas

37:20.323 --> 37:21.991
for him and her.

37:23.827 --> 37:25.995
It's perfect.

37:26.037 --> 37:27.163
Thank you, Spencer!

37:27.205 --> 37:28.581
Aw, happy to help.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.835
Hey, what are you
doing later?

37:31.876 --> 37:34.504
Why don't you come over
to our place for game night?

37:34.546 --> 37:36.840
Um, I wouldn't want to impose.
Don't worry--

37:36.881 --> 37:38.466
No, it's not an imposition.
Seriously.

37:38.508 --> 37:40.552
Dee Dee will
be there, too.

37:41.636 --> 37:43.680
You sure your family
won't mind?

37:43.722 --> 37:45.515
I am positive.

37:45.557 --> 37:48.476
Like they say,
the more the merrier.

37:48.518 --> 37:50.854
Maybe we could even get in
a game of Christmas Pictionary.

37:50.895 --> 37:53.064
Mm-hm. Yeah. I mean,
if you're okay with losing,

37:53.106 --> 37:54.983
we can definitely
arrange that.

37:55.025 --> 37:57.902
(laughing)
I'm willing to take the risk.

37:59.195 --> 38:00.739
(car approaching,
horn honking)

38:02.240 --> 38:03.908
Oh, well.
I better go help him.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.666
So, Mrs. Mousey said,

38:11.708 --> 38:13.460
"Thank you for the ride,
Santa.

38:13.501 --> 38:15.128
I'll make sure to
leave some gouda and milk

38:15.170 --> 38:16.838
under the tree for you."

38:16.880 --> 38:18.465
And that's how
the magical Christmas mouse

38:18.506 --> 38:20.050
found his way home.

38:20.091 --> 38:21.426
The end.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.802
Again! Again!

38:22.844 --> 38:25.013
Why don't you read it
this time?

38:25.055 --> 38:27.891
No, you're better at the voices,
Auntie Charlie.

38:27.932 --> 38:30.935
Hey, nobody does
Mrs. Mousey like your mom.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.355
Hey. The truth hurts, sis.
Deal with it.

38:33.396 --> 38:34.397
(laughing)

38:34.439 --> 38:35.440
(doorbell ringing)

38:35.482 --> 38:37.233
Mom:
Oh, I'll get it.

38:39.819 --> 38:40.945
Hi!

38:40.987 --> 38:43.073
Welcome, you two.
Let me take your coats.

38:43.114 --> 38:44.741
- Spencer: Thank you so much.
- Dee Dee: Thanks.

38:46.493 --> 38:48.787
Mom:
Make yourself comfortable.

38:48.828 --> 38:49.829
Thank you.

38:51.456 --> 38:52.791
Welcome.

38:52.832 --> 38:56.544
Thank you.
This house is incredible.

38:56.586 --> 38:58.296
Did you grow up here?

38:58.338 --> 38:59.589
Born and raised.

38:59.631 --> 39:01.800
Well, I was born
in a hospital.

39:01.841 --> 39:02.717
Right.

39:02.759 --> 39:03.760
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

39:03.802 --> 39:06.471
Wow.
If these walls could talk.

39:06.513 --> 39:07.806
No kidding.

39:07.847 --> 39:10.558
I actually had
my first kiss right over there.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.976
- No way!
- Mm-hm.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.645
Was it everything you hoped
and dreamed it would be?

39:13.687 --> 39:15.772
No, it was
terrible actually.

39:15.814 --> 39:17.941
(laughing)

39:17.982 --> 39:19.150
Wow!

39:20.902 --> 39:22.362
Adorable.

39:22.404 --> 39:24.322
Yeah.

39:24.364 --> 39:25.907
Pajamboree?

39:25.949 --> 39:27.075
You bet.

39:27.117 --> 39:28.702
Mm, look at you.

39:28.743 --> 39:31.037
Flannel jammies.
The horror!

39:31.079 --> 39:32.205
Yeah, I have to admit,

39:32.247 --> 39:33.665
those were actually
pretty comfortable.

39:33.707 --> 39:34.541
See?

39:34.582 --> 39:35.917
(chuckling)

39:35.959 --> 39:39.754
All right, everyone.
Let's get started.

39:39.796 --> 39:41.047
Christmas Pictionary?

39:41.089 --> 39:42.173
Your wish was my command.

39:42.215 --> 39:44.050
Okay!

39:44.092 --> 39:46.720
*

39:46.761 --> 39:50.056
(shouting over each other)

39:50.098 --> 39:51.307
(cheering)

39:51.349 --> 39:52.517
* Bells are ringing *

39:52.559 --> 39:54.811
* There's a magic
in the air *

39:54.853 --> 39:57.397
* Choirs are singing *

39:57.439 --> 40:00.483
* Full of
joy and happiness *

40:00.525 --> 40:02.944
* Stars are bright *

40:02.986 --> 40:04.696
* As we share
a winter's night *

40:04.738 --> 40:06.614
* Here's to Christmas *

40:06.656 --> 40:09.034
(talking over each other)

40:09.075 --> 40:09.993
* Kids are smiling *

40:10.035 --> 40:12.871
* Making snowmen
in the street *

40:12.912 --> 40:14.581
* People driving
to be home... *

40:14.622 --> 40:17.417
Oh, safe drive, Spencer.
It was so lovely to have you.

40:17.459 --> 40:19.044
Thank you for having me.

40:19.085 --> 40:20.503
We'll get 'em next year.

40:20.545 --> 40:21.546
Unlikely.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.631
* Here's to Christmas... *

40:23.673 --> 40:25.633
Thanks for inviting me.

40:25.675 --> 40:27.135
Your family's awesome.

40:27.177 --> 40:29.763
Yeah, well, thank you
for the game suggestion.

40:29.804 --> 40:31.890
I had a lot more fun
than I thought I would.

40:31.931 --> 40:34.392
Now, all I want
to do is draw.

40:34.434 --> 40:35.602
That was the hope.

40:36.895 --> 40:39.105
Is that why
you chose Pictionary?

40:39.147 --> 40:40.732
I thought it might help
get you out of your head

40:40.774 --> 40:43.568
and reconnect with
drawing just for fun.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.071
Thank you.
It did help.

40:46.112 --> 40:47.280
Good.

40:47.322 --> 40:49.574
I expect three designs
by 9:00am tomorrow.

40:49.616 --> 40:51.326
Yes, sir. On it.

40:53.244 --> 40:56.915
Okay. Well... goodnight.

40:56.956 --> 40:58.625
You, too.

41:01.586 --> 41:04.255
(door opening, closing)

41:08.176 --> 41:09.427
(knocking)

41:09.469 --> 41:11.346
Christina:
Char?

41:11.388 --> 41:13.431
Charlie.

41:13.473 --> 41:15.475
(chuckling)
Are you awake?

41:15.517 --> 41:16.976
What time is it?

41:17.018 --> 41:19.270
It's almost 10:00.
When did you go to bed?

41:19.312 --> 41:21.439
I don't know. I--

41:21.481 --> 41:23.108
I just kept sketching.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.193
I had so many ideas
bouncing around in my head.

41:25.235 --> 41:28.446
Hm. Looks like you may
have found your muse.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.990
- What do you mean?
- What? Nothing.

41:31.032 --> 41:33.618
Hey, do you know where
my old sewing machine is?

41:33.660 --> 41:35.537
Should be in the closet.

41:35.578 --> 41:37.914
- Huh.
- Okay.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.458
Coffee's going to
run out if you're not quick.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.002
I'll be down soon.

41:48.049 --> 41:58.018
*

42:10.697 --> 42:12.157
Spencer:
Thank you. Yeah, that's good.

42:12.198 --> 42:18.288
*

42:18.329 --> 42:19.372
I've done it.

42:19.414 --> 42:22.292
I have sketched
five new designs.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.169
Five?! That's amazing.

42:24.210 --> 42:26.629
Yeah. Now, we just need to
figure out which ones are best.

42:26.671 --> 42:28.173
How do we decide?

42:28.214 --> 42:31.009
I have to make them first,
obviously,

42:31.051 --> 42:32.844
and then,
as my personal mannequin,

42:32.886 --> 42:34.429
I will need your help.

42:34.471 --> 42:35.847
What do you have
in mind?

42:41.978 --> 42:43.938
Oh, wow,
what about this?

42:43.980 --> 42:45.148
Like a Grinch moment,
you know?

42:45.190 --> 42:47.525
No.
No, that's not gonna work.

42:47.567 --> 42:50.236
Okay, um-- Oh!

42:50.278 --> 42:52.197
Oh, look at this.

42:52.238 --> 42:53.198
Oh, that's cozy.

42:53.239 --> 42:55.075
Oh, it's so soft.

42:55.116 --> 42:56.701
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I think it's perfect.

42:56.743 --> 42:57.911
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

42:57.952 --> 42:59.245
- Winner.
- All right.

42:59.287 --> 43:02.707
*

43:02.749 --> 43:05.502
* Ring the bells,
blow the horn *

43:05.543 --> 43:08.713
* Let the music play *

43:08.755 --> 43:09.714
* School is out *

43:09.756 --> 43:11.633
Well, that's great,
and then...

43:11.675 --> 43:13.510
- No?
- No.

43:13.551 --> 43:14.552
- No?
- It's nothing.

43:14.594 --> 43:15.970
All right. X it out.

43:18.682 --> 43:21.017
* Celebrate with
family and friends *

43:21.059 --> 43:23.728
* Christmas is here again *

43:23.770 --> 43:25.939
* Listening to
the Christmas... *

43:25.980 --> 43:27.399
What are you doing in there?
Come out.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.525
(knocking)

43:28.566 --> 43:31.695
Spencer:
I'm on my way.

43:31.736 --> 43:33.405
Okay, so?

43:33.446 --> 43:34.531
How does it feel?

43:34.572 --> 43:37.867
Feels good. Comfy.
How does it look?

43:37.909 --> 43:39.327
It's a little bit
loose in here

43:39.369 --> 43:42.914
and it can be taken in
a little at the waist,

43:42.956 --> 43:47.085
the length isn't quite right,
and the collar needs some work.

43:47.127 --> 43:48.753
I'm not so sure
about the fabric either,

43:48.795 --> 43:51.047
but for a first attempt
it's not bad.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.049
Just okay?

43:53.091 --> 43:54.592
Yeah, something isn't
quite right,

43:54.634 --> 43:57.095
but, no,
we're getting there.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.930
All right, but you're
not discouraged, right?

43:58.972 --> 44:02.100
No.
Actually, I'm quite inspired.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.309
Great.

44:03.351 --> 44:05.937
Told you the Elfcapades would
inspire you.

44:05.979 --> 44:10.483
Yeah. Not so sure
it's just the Elfcapades.

44:13.570 --> 44:16.406
(phone ringing)

44:16.448 --> 44:17.532
(grunting)

44:20.035 --> 44:20.994
Hello?

44:22.120 --> 44:23.621
Uh, yes.

44:23.663 --> 44:25.832
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.

44:28.543 --> 44:29.586
Duty calls.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.922
Well, I'll see you
at bingo tonight?

44:32.964 --> 44:34.132
I wouldn't miss it.

44:34.174 --> 44:35.175
Great.

44:36.092 --> 44:37.469
I should probably
change, right?

44:37.510 --> 44:38.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

44:38.511 --> 44:39.554
Thank you.

44:47.103 --> 44:50.148
Okay, do you want
a smoky eye or natural?

44:50.190 --> 44:52.942
Natural. I don't want it to
seem like I'm trying too hard.

44:52.984 --> 44:55.737
(chuckling)
Okay.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.238
What?

44:58.740 --> 45:00.200
Nothing.

45:00.241 --> 45:01.785
I just--
I don't remember the last time

45:01.826 --> 45:03.703
you asked me
to do your make-up.

45:03.745 --> 45:05.705
So?

45:05.747 --> 45:07.415
So, you like him.

45:07.457 --> 45:10.627
Like who? Spencer?

45:10.669 --> 45:11.753
Is that such a bad thing?

45:11.795 --> 45:14.047
Christina, I live in New York.

45:14.089 --> 45:15.715
Okay, relationships are
hard enough

45:15.757 --> 45:18.426
without the long distance
involved.

45:18.468 --> 45:19.886
Whatever you say.

45:19.928 --> 45:22.722
I just-- I don't want you to
miss out on something good

45:22.764 --> 45:26.643
because you're so
focused on your job.

45:26.685 --> 45:30.647
But Alistair isn't job.

45:30.689 --> 45:31.690
It's my life.

45:34.818 --> 45:36.069
I just miss my sister.

45:37.737 --> 45:41.032
It's been four years since
you've come home for Christmas.

45:42.826 --> 45:44.035
I know.

45:50.083 --> 45:52.002
Hey, do you remember
when we used to have

45:52.043 --> 45:53.586
sleepovers in my room?

45:53.628 --> 45:56.256
We'd do each other's
make-up

45:56.297 --> 45:59.884
and we'd stay up all night
and talk about our crushes.

45:59.926 --> 46:02.095
(chuckling)
Of course.

46:02.137 --> 46:04.389
We should do that again.

46:04.431 --> 46:05.432
Before I go.

46:07.058 --> 46:08.977
I'd love that.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.311
Okay. Good.

46:11.604 --> 46:12.897
Good.

46:12.939 --> 46:14.065
(chuckling)

46:14.107 --> 46:15.692
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

46:15.734 --> 46:21.573
*

46:21.614 --> 46:25.118
Next up I have Prancer!

46:25.160 --> 46:27.954
Ah, yes!
Got that one. Sweet!

46:27.996 --> 46:29.080
Spencer: Wow.

46:29.122 --> 46:32.167
You really want
that giant elf bear.

46:32.208 --> 46:34.377
What?
Ben would love it.

46:34.419 --> 46:37.130
Oh, sure. Ben.

46:39.215 --> 46:43.636
Okay, next we have
Frosty the Snowman.

46:43.678 --> 46:45.221
Oh, I have
that one, too! Okay.

46:45.263 --> 46:47.223
I just need mistletoe
and then I win.

46:47.265 --> 46:49.225
These people
are all going down.

46:49.267 --> 46:51.144
I love Christmas bingo.

46:51.186 --> 46:53.438
I think you just
like winning.

46:53.480 --> 46:58.276
Uh-oh, are you jealous of
my superior bingo success?

46:58.318 --> 47:02.280
Hardly. Look, the--
the giant stuffy's all yours.

47:02.322 --> 47:04.657
To be honest,
elves creep me out.

47:04.699 --> 47:06.034
- What?
- Yeah.

47:06.076 --> 47:09.829
Mr. Christmas is
creeped out by elves.

47:09.871 --> 47:11.414
What a twist.

47:11.456 --> 47:13.667
Oh, don't even get me started
on elf on a shelf. Chilling.

47:13.708 --> 47:15.669
- What?
- Yeah.

47:15.710 --> 47:17.587
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

47:17.629 --> 47:18.505
You're going to miss me win!

47:18.546 --> 47:19.547
I'll be quick.

47:24.511 --> 47:25.762
Hey, Charlotte.

47:25.804 --> 47:26.846
Oh! Hey, Gwen.

47:26.888 --> 47:28.515
I see you're here
with Spencer.

47:28.556 --> 47:29.474
Yeah.

47:29.516 --> 47:31.976
Are you guys here...
together?

47:32.018 --> 47:34.187
Oh, um, I don't...

47:35.939 --> 47:39.025
You are just
too cute, Mayor.

47:39.067 --> 47:41.611
I am going to go
get us another round.

47:41.653 --> 47:42.987
Sounds good.

47:43.029 --> 47:44.989
- Hello? Earth to Charlotte!
- Uh. What?

47:45.031 --> 47:46.491
(rattling)

47:46.533 --> 47:50.412
All right,
next we have mistletoe!

47:52.747 --> 47:53.790
- Bingo!
- Bingo!

47:53.832 --> 47:55.667
You got bingo. You gotta go up.

47:55.709 --> 47:56.751
Go, go. Hurry!

47:58.253 --> 48:01.715
Well, come on up, you two.
Let me check your sheets.

48:01.756 --> 48:02.757
Hey, Charlotte.

48:02.799 --> 48:03.800
Hi.

48:05.385 --> 48:06.803
Dee Dee: Interesting to
see you here, Evan.

48:06.845 --> 48:08.179
And why is that?

48:08.221 --> 48:11.224
Considering you're the one
who took away funding.

48:11.266 --> 48:13.226
I didn't expect
you to participate.

48:13.268 --> 48:15.186
Wait, you were
the one who stopped

48:15.228 --> 48:17.105
the funding for Elfcapades?

48:17.147 --> 48:18.815
Well, there's more
important things that need

48:18.857 --> 48:20.650
budgetary attention
in this town.

48:20.692 --> 48:24.029
But you knew how important
this event is to my family,

48:24.070 --> 48:27.615
and to my dad, and to me.

48:27.657 --> 48:31.911
I know. I'm sorry. It just isn't
a priority for me right now.

48:31.953 --> 48:33.788
Well, folks,
it looks like there's a tie,

48:33.830 --> 48:36.166
but there's only one prize.

48:36.207 --> 48:39.419
Oh, it's fine. He can have it.

48:39.461 --> 48:40.879
Are you sure?

48:40.920 --> 48:43.089
I mean, that would be great.
Jillian really wanted it.

48:43.131 --> 48:44.174
Who's Jillian?

48:44.215 --> 48:46.176
Oh, my beautiful
new fiancee.

48:47.635 --> 48:52.557
The only way to deal with
this unprecedented moment

48:52.599 --> 48:56.269
is the ultimate
mistletoe tie-breaker.

48:56.311 --> 48:58.605
Um, what is that?

48:58.646 --> 49:00.190
The first person to
find someone to kiss them

49:00.231 --> 49:02.192
under the mistletoe wins.

49:07.405 --> 49:09.574
Jillian! Jill!
Come here, hurry!

49:09.616 --> 49:11.951
Yeah, quick.
Jillyboo, please!

49:11.993 --> 49:13.119
Quick! Please!

49:13.161 --> 49:15.163
Seriously? What are you doing?

49:15.205 --> 49:17.290
Winning you that
creepy, giant elf bear.

49:17.332 --> 49:22.712
*

49:22.754 --> 49:27.217
(crowd cheering, whistling)

49:27.258 --> 49:29.219
Charlotte Carmichael wins.

49:29.260 --> 49:34.432
(crowd applauding)

49:40.188 --> 49:44.984
(both laughing)

49:45.026 --> 49:47.821
Ah, you really saved
my butt back there.

49:47.862 --> 49:51.574
Did you see the look
on Evan's face? Priceless.

49:52.909 --> 49:55.829
Not all heroes wear capes,
I guess.

49:55.870 --> 49:56.871
Just coveralls.

49:56.913 --> 49:58.998
(both chuckling)

49:59.040 --> 50:01.376
Oh, I can't believe
Evan is responsible

50:01.418 --> 50:03.712
for ending the Elfcapades.

50:03.753 --> 50:05.630
That was my dad's legacy.

50:05.672 --> 50:08.341
Dee Dee's been doing everything
she can to keep it going.

50:08.383 --> 50:09.509
She's heartbroken.

50:09.551 --> 50:11.636
It's not right.

50:11.678 --> 50:13.638
We need to save it.

50:13.680 --> 50:14.764
How?

50:14.806 --> 50:16.474
(sighing)
I don't know,

50:16.516 --> 50:18.518
but I need to
think of something.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.021
The Elfcapades is
important to this town.

50:21.062 --> 50:22.647
It brings people together.

50:22.689 --> 50:25.358
I completely agree.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.903
I forgot how special the holiday
season is in this town.

50:30.238 --> 50:32.365
I really feel
like I'm home again,

50:32.407 --> 50:34.826
and I haven't felt that
way in a long time.

50:34.868 --> 50:35.827
So, thank you.

50:37.787 --> 50:38.955
Well, I feel the same way.

50:41.082 --> 50:42.709
- Well--
- Well...

50:42.751 --> 50:43.752
Goodnight, Spencer.

50:43.793 --> 50:44.753
Goodnight, Charlotte.

50:47.505 --> 50:54.471
*

51:02.145 --> 51:04.481
(indistinct conversation)

51:04.522 --> 51:06.191
Good morning, everyone.

51:06.232 --> 51:07.275
Good morning, honey.

51:07.317 --> 51:08.818
Oh, you look chipper.

51:08.860 --> 51:09.861
I feel chipper.

51:09.903 --> 51:10.904
Mm.

51:10.945 --> 51:12.030
Peter: Oh, yeah?

51:12.072 --> 51:13.365
Yeah!
My designs are coming along.

51:13.406 --> 51:15.867
I'm actually excited
for the Elfcapades tonight.

51:15.909 --> 51:17.369
Life is good.

51:17.410 --> 51:19.496
Charlotte Carmichael getting
into the Christmas spirit.

51:19.537 --> 51:21.122
Never thought I'd see the day.

51:21.164 --> 51:23.249
Would this happen
to have to do anything

51:23.291 --> 51:24.542
with a certain someone?

51:24.584 --> 51:25.877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:25.919 --> 51:27.170
Hm.

51:27.212 --> 51:28.588
Can I pour you
a cup of coffee, Charlotte?

51:30.006 --> 51:31.257
Yes, Rick. That'd be great.

51:31.299 --> 51:32.467
Thank you.

51:34.344 --> 51:37.430
Aunt Charlie, are you in love?

51:37.472 --> 51:38.640
- (chuckling)
- What?

51:38.682 --> 51:40.141
Love?

51:40.183 --> 51:41.476
Who said anything about love?

51:41.518 --> 51:43.728
Well I heard Mom
and Dad talking about

51:43.770 --> 51:45.814
how you seem like
a smitten kitten.

51:45.855 --> 51:47.482
(family laughing)

51:47.524 --> 51:49.943
When are you going to
learn to stop eavesdropping?

51:49.984 --> 51:51.111
- Never!
- (grunting)

51:51.152 --> 51:53.655
Well, we think
he's perfect for you.

51:53.697 --> 51:58.451
Guys, relax, okay?
It was just one kiss.

51:58.493 --> 51:59.953
Mom, Christina, & Ben:
You guys kissed?!

51:59.994 --> 52:01.329
Uh...

52:01.371 --> 52:04.165
If I were you,
I'd have breakfast at Dee Dee's

52:04.207 --> 52:05.917
before the interrogation.

52:05.959 --> 52:06.918
- Good idea.
- No!

52:06.960 --> 52:07.877
I'll see you guys later.

52:07.919 --> 52:09.045
No! No!

52:09.087 --> 52:10.463
Run, Charlotte. Run!

52:10.505 --> 52:13.758
- No! No! Why? Why?!
- Save yourself.

52:13.800 --> 52:22.934
*

52:22.976 --> 52:23.893
Hey.

52:25.520 --> 52:28.023
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

52:28.064 --> 52:30.734
Charlie, you startled me. Uh...

52:30.775 --> 52:33.319
I thought we weren't meeting up
'til later. What's going on?

52:33.361 --> 52:34.404
I just had some time off

52:34.446 --> 52:36.781
so I thought I'd come
check on my car.

52:36.823 --> 52:39.409
Oh, well, I, uh...

52:39.451 --> 52:43.038
I got the part,
so should be done today.

52:43.079 --> 52:44.122
Radiator leak?

52:44.164 --> 52:45.540
Yeah.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.918
You gonna solder it?

52:48.960 --> 52:50.920
I'm sorry. Who are you?

52:50.962 --> 52:54.257
(chuckling)
My dad taught me all about cars.

52:54.299 --> 52:55.550
He didn't want me
to get stranded in

52:55.592 --> 52:57.385
the middle of nowhere
and not know the basics.

52:57.427 --> 53:00.263
Benefits of having
a tow truck driver as a father.

53:00.305 --> 53:01.681
Exactly.

53:03.058 --> 53:04.934
So, um, I was wondering
if you could come by before

53:04.976 --> 53:07.395
the Elfcapades
and try on a new design?

53:07.437 --> 53:08.438
It's almost Christmas Eve

53:08.480 --> 53:09.731
and I don't have
everything I need.

53:09.773 --> 53:11.900
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you need.

53:11.941 --> 53:13.234
Great.

53:13.276 --> 53:17.822
And, uh,
speaking of Christmas Eve,

53:17.864 --> 53:19.574
are you going to
miss the Pajamboree?

53:19.616 --> 53:21.659
Well, the fashion show
is at 2:00,

53:21.701 --> 53:23.244
should be out of there by 3:00,

53:23.286 --> 53:24.788
and should be able
to make it in time.

53:24.829 --> 53:25.997
It's going to be
cutting it close,

53:26.039 --> 53:28.041
but I don't want to miss it

53:28.083 --> 53:31.753
Great. I was, uh,
hoping that we'd go together.

53:31.795 --> 53:33.546
Um...

53:33.588 --> 53:37.092
Yeah, I'd like that.

53:37.133 --> 53:39.803
Good. Cool.

53:39.844 --> 53:41.429
All right, well,
I should get back to work.

53:41.471 --> 53:44.557
Yes, thank you.

53:44.599 --> 53:47.268
Oh, um, what times do you
want to meet for the Elfcapades?

53:47.310 --> 53:49.229
Well, um...

53:51.189 --> 53:52.524
Let's do a change of plans.

53:52.565 --> 53:54.526
I'm gonna pick you up.

53:54.567 --> 53:56.611
I got a surprise for you.

53:56.653 --> 53:59.155
Spencer Dobbs
missing the Elfcapades?

53:59.197 --> 54:00.407
Should I be scared?

54:00.448 --> 54:03.201
Maybe. Maybe not.

54:03.243 --> 54:05.537
Oh, playing the mystery card.

54:05.578 --> 54:07.372
- Mm-hm.
- I'm intrigued.

54:07.414 --> 54:09.958
Now, get out of here.
I gotta fix this car.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.502
Okay, okay. Bye.

54:16.172 --> 54:21.094
(whirring)

54:25.306 --> 54:26.975
- (sighing)
- Why the long face?

54:27.017 --> 54:27.892
I don't know.

54:29.269 --> 54:30.645
Something's off.

54:30.687 --> 54:32.897
I like the general idea, but...

54:34.524 --> 54:35.608
..that's not the right feeling.

54:35.650 --> 54:37.902
Oh, what feeling
are you going for?

54:37.944 --> 54:38.903
I don't know.

54:38.945 --> 54:40.989
Like how it felt
when I was a kid.

54:41.031 --> 54:42.032
Hm.

54:43.074 --> 54:44.659
I have something.

54:44.701 --> 54:48.621
*

54:48.663 --> 54:53.335
Maybe this will remind you.

54:53.376 --> 54:54.586
Hm?

54:57.213 --> 54:58.256
Oh.

54:59.299 --> 55:00.300
Yeah.

55:04.137 --> 55:06.264
We really did have
the best Christmases, didn't we?

55:06.306 --> 55:08.516
Yeah, we did.

55:08.558 --> 55:10.769
And we still do.

55:10.810 --> 55:12.228
It's just
a little different now.

55:14.189 --> 55:15.273
Mm-hm.

55:15.315 --> 55:17.067
You'll get there, honey.

55:17.108 --> 55:18.068
Thanks, Mom.

55:19.694 --> 55:23.531
Maybe you just need to step
away from this for a moment

55:23.573 --> 55:25.617
in order to see it more clearly.

55:25.658 --> 55:27.744
You know what?

55:27.786 --> 55:29.037
I could use a break.

55:29.079 --> 55:30.705
Now, that's a good idea.

55:33.291 --> 55:34.834
- Okay.
- Yeah.

55:43.843 --> 55:47.180
All right,
keep those eyes closed.

55:47.222 --> 55:48.181
Okay.

55:54.187 --> 55:56.690
All right, come on down.
Keep those eyes closed.

55:56.731 --> 55:57.857
I'm right here.

56:01.486 --> 56:03.446
All right, watch out.
I got the door.

56:03.488 --> 56:06.116
'Kay.

56:06.157 --> 56:07.283
Now, come forward.

56:07.325 --> 56:09.035
This is a lot like
the beginnings of those

56:09.077 --> 56:11.496
true crime documentaries,
you know.

56:11.538 --> 56:13.164
Come on.
You trust me, don't you?

56:13.206 --> 56:15.458
Yeah, I do. I think.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.210
Okay.

56:17.252 --> 56:18.294
Open your eyes.

56:22.465 --> 56:24.134
Is-- Is this?

56:26.344 --> 56:27.721
I found it on
this dealer's site

56:27.762 --> 56:30.390
for people who like
to restore old cars.

56:30.432 --> 56:33.268
I decided to buy it,

56:33.309 --> 56:37.063
fix it up, and,
I don't know...

56:37.105 --> 56:39.274
Didn't feel right
letting it sit there

56:39.315 --> 56:41.651
and just get bought
for parts.

56:45.113 --> 56:46.781
You're really amazing,
you know that?

56:49.284 --> 56:51.119
What do you say?

56:51.161 --> 56:52.328
Wanna sit in it?

56:54.622 --> 56:55.957
Come on.

56:55.999 --> 57:06.009
*

57:14.809 --> 57:15.810
(door closing)

57:15.852 --> 57:18.396
This looks exactly
the same.

57:21.858 --> 57:24.694
I love these
old '90s radios.

57:24.736 --> 57:26.154
They don't make 'em
like this anymore.

57:26.196 --> 57:28.948
And I wonder if
it's still got some juice.

57:31.576 --> 57:36.081
(song playing on radio)

57:37.123 --> 57:46.966
*

57:47.008 --> 57:48.218
Is that--

57:51.304 --> 57:52.555
Huh.

57:52.597 --> 57:53.848
No way.

57:53.890 --> 57:56.059
Are those his coveralls?

57:57.686 --> 57:59.062
Yeah.

58:01.564 --> 58:02.899
(chuckling)

58:06.319 --> 58:08.905
This is the greatest gift
you could have ever given me.

58:08.947 --> 58:16.538
*

58:16.579 --> 58:18.540
Can I ask you something?

58:18.581 --> 58:20.500
Yeah, of course.

58:21.835 --> 58:24.004
How come you haven't dated?

58:25.380 --> 58:26.756
Since...

58:29.217 --> 58:32.804
I know, I need to get back into
the dating game at some point.

58:35.765 --> 58:37.100
It's just...

58:39.936 --> 58:43.023
Somehow moving on
just still felt wrong.

58:44.774 --> 58:46.192
You know?

58:46.234 --> 58:47.152
Mm.

58:48.486 --> 58:49.779
I know what you mean.

58:54.659 --> 58:56.286
It's hard letting go.

58:57.746 --> 59:00.081
That's why I moved here.

59:00.123 --> 59:02.042
Is it helping?

59:05.962 --> 59:07.172
It's starting to.

59:09.466 --> 59:19.434
*

59:32.447 --> 59:33.740
Chris.

59:33.782 --> 59:35.784
- Wake up.
- (snorting)

59:35.825 --> 59:38.244
What took you so long?

59:38.286 --> 59:39.371
It's eight o'clock.

59:39.412 --> 59:40.580
Oh.

59:41.915 --> 59:43.333
Did you have a good time?

59:43.375 --> 59:46.002
I had the best time.

59:46.044 --> 59:47.962
I think you were right.

59:48.004 --> 59:50.173
I think
I'm a smitten kitten.

59:50.215 --> 59:52.092
- (both laughing)
- Tell me everything.

59:56.137 --> 01:00:06.064
*

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:09.859
Spencer, you're up early.
Can I get you a coffee?

01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:11.361
That would be great.
Thanks.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:14.072
Everything all right?

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.573
Yeah.

01:00:17.742 --> 01:00:20.036
No. I don't know.
I, uh...

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.207
I could use
some advice actually.

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:26.209
What's going on?

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.585
Well...

01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:31.256
There's this person.

01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:36.011
And I can't stop
thinking about her,

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:38.221
but I don't know
what to do about it.

01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:40.056
Ah, so you've caught the feels.

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:42.434
Yup.

01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:43.601
Does she know?

01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:46.855
And I don't know
if I should tell her.

01:00:46.896 --> 01:00:48.982
How come?

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:51.943
I don't know, Dee.

01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.570
Laura's been gone
for almost three years,

01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:58.450
but it still feels wrong
thinking about someone else.

01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:05.206
I'm worried that if
I start falling for someone new

01:01:05.248 --> 01:01:07.042
I'll forget about her entirely.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:11.004
Darling, losing someone
we love is a type of grief

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:13.381
that never fully heals.

01:01:13.423 --> 01:01:16.051
Laura will always
be a part of you.

01:01:16.092 --> 01:01:18.219
The love you two
shared will never go away.

01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:21.431
But to cut yourself
off from loving again,

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:23.558
that's a true tragedy.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.435
You're right.

01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:28.480
If I could give you any advice,

01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.275
it'd be to tell this new
someone how you really feel.

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.486
I regret not telling my
brother how much I loved him.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.280
Life is short.

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:39.991
Don't waste it by
withholding your feelings.

01:01:40.033 --> 01:01:42.994
There's never a right time.
There's only now.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:54.130
*

01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:59.636
(knocking)

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.477
Oh, Spencer! Hi.

01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:09.062
Hi, Olivia.

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.398
Is Charlotte home?

01:02:11.439 --> 01:02:12.649
You bet, come in.

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:13.983
Okay, great. Thank you.

01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:15.735
She's just upstairs.

01:02:15.777 --> 01:02:17.570
Okay.

01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:21.282
The designs are all set.
I just need to helm the sleeves.

01:02:21.324 --> 01:02:22.992
Margo: I can't believe
you pulled it all off

01:02:23.034 --> 01:02:24.869
on your own in just six days.

01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:26.329
Definitely wasn't all on my own.

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.832
My friend, Spencer Dobbs,
who you'll meet,

01:02:28.873 --> 01:02:30.500
he was such a big help.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:32.460
I couldn't have
done it without him.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:36.297
Margo: Ooh-la-la. Who's this
Spencer Dobbs you speak of?

01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:38.508
He's so great. You'd love him.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.510
He totally helped me
get out of my head,

01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:43.346
and reminded me why
I love designing so much,

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.849
and how much I love Christmas.

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:49.310
Margo: Huh. When will I get to
meet this boyfriend of yours?

01:02:49.352 --> 01:02:51.354
Oh, no. He is not my boyfriend.

01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.815
I mean, he's great,
but Alistair's in New York,

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:57.736
you're in New York.
He's a local Brooksbend mechanic

01:02:57.777 --> 01:02:59.571
who wears coveralls all day.

01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:01.197
I mean, it'll never work.

01:03:05.702 --> 01:03:07.871
I don't know, maybe it could.

01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:09.205
He's pretty amazing.

01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:11.458
He reminds me a lot of my dad.

01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:22.218
*

01:03:24.095 --> 01:03:26.014
Still haven't
heard from him, huh?

01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:28.183
I hope he's all right.

01:03:28.224 --> 01:03:30.143
We were supposed to celebrate
the pajamas being done.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.686
Oh, can I see?

01:03:36.107 --> 01:03:39.944
Oh, wow.
They are so cute. Well done.

01:03:39.986 --> 01:03:41.613
Thanks.

01:03:41.654 --> 01:03:44.282
Maybe he just forgot
and he's at his shop.

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.451
You know how men can be.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:56.461
*

01:03:57.962 --> 01:03:59.756
Spencer.

01:03:59.798 --> 01:04:01.883
- Hey.
- Hey, what happened?

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.843
I was waiting
for you at Dee Dee's.

01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:06.054
Brought you a coffee.

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.764
Must have slipped my mind.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:09.057
Okay. Uh--

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.392
She's all yours.

01:04:12.852 --> 01:04:13.978
Are you okay?

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.273
Oh, I'm fine.

01:04:17.315 --> 01:04:19.984
Are you sure?
You seem a little off.

01:04:20.026 --> 01:04:21.611
Do I?

01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:26.741
Must be because
I'm just a local mechanic.

01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:28.910
What?

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.287
I heard you on
the phone this morning.

01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:34.582
It's real nice, Charlie.

01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:38.294
Wait, wait. Spencer, hang on.
I can explain.

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:40.255
No, it's okay.
Don't bother. I get it.

01:04:40.296 --> 01:04:42.841
I'm just some small-town nobody.

01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:44.884
I'm not good enough for
some bigshot fashion designer.

01:04:44.926 --> 01:04:46.136
It's okay.

01:04:46.177 --> 01:04:49.180
What? No, no. Please, Spencer.

01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:51.307
I was just talking to
my closest friend about

01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:55.186
how I wasn't sure if
long-distance would work.

01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:57.105
You clearly didn't hear
the full conversation.

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:58.523
I didn't need to.

01:05:00.608 --> 01:05:02.235
So that's it?

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:05.947
One small misunderstanding
and you just freeze me out?

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:09.242
Charlotte, I can't be with
somebody who cares more about

01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:11.327
their career than their family.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.624
I think you're just afraid
to move on from Laura.

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:18.001
Listen,
I got a lot of work to do.

01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:19.711
Take your car and go.

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.795
- Spencer, could you just--
- No, could you please just--

01:05:20.837 --> 01:05:22.047
- (gasping)
- Oh.

01:05:22.088 --> 01:05:24.174
(sighing)

01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:25.800
God, Charlotte, I'm so sorry.

01:05:25.842 --> 01:05:27.010
Let me--

01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:28.595
No, please.

01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:29.804
(sighing)

01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:36.519
Thanks, Spencer.

01:05:36.561 --> 01:05:39.230
I guess this last week together
really was just a waste of time.

01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:47.572
*

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:58.875
*

01:06:01.836 --> 01:06:05.715
(family laughing, chatting)

01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.094
Christina:
Okay, Rick. Right on, right on.

01:06:09.135 --> 01:06:11.596
Okay, that's looking good.

01:06:11.638 --> 01:06:12.847
Hey.

01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:14.057
What are you guys doing?

01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:15.433
Oh. Hi, honey. Come, sit.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.976
Yeah, just like old times.

01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:18.812
Um...

01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:20.397
Is everything okay, Charlie?

01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:23.400
My name is Charlotte.
Only my family calls me Charlie.

01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:26.069
Oh, honey.
Don't talk to him like that.

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.821
And you're sitting
in my dad's chair.

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:30.365
Char. Don't.

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:33.410
Don't what? Talk about Dad?

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:35.995
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:37.622
Excuse me?

01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:41.251
Ever since Dad died,
nobody even talks about him

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:44.629
or mentions him.
It's like he never existed.

01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:47.507
And now you have
Rick replacing him

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:49.926
like an actor
in some bad sitcom.

01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:52.095
How would you know whether
or not we talk about him?

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.763
You're never here.

01:06:53.805 --> 01:06:56.099
We talk about him
all the time, Charlotte.

01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:57.434
Just not when you come to visit,

01:06:57.475 --> 01:06:59.144
because we don't
want you to feel bad.

01:06:59.185 --> 01:07:00.770
Feel bad?

01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:01.980
About what?

01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:05.191
What? Tell me!

01:07:05.233 --> 01:07:07.485
Just be real with
yourself for once.

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:10.739
The reason why you're upset
isn't because of Rick.

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.366
It's because you feel guilty
that you didn't come home

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:15.660
when Dad needed you most.

01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:17.120
Saving the Elfcapades
isn't going to

01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:18.580
bring him back, Charlotte.

01:07:18.621 --> 01:07:21.750
You don't make time for people.

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.461
And if you're not careful,
you're going to end up alone.

01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:31.343
Um...

01:07:31.384 --> 01:07:35.013
My car's fixed and my pajamas
are completely ruined.

01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:38.058
So, uh, there's no need
for me to stay here any longer

01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:40.352
than I have to.

01:07:40.393 --> 01:07:42.020
I'm going to head for
New York first thing tomorrow.

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:44.064
No, Charlotte. Hold on.

01:07:45.565 --> 01:07:50.570
(crying)

01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:07.337
*

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:08.755
(knocking)

01:08:11.091 --> 01:08:12.217
Hey.

01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:13.927
Hi.

01:08:13.968 --> 01:08:15.136
Can I come in?

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.513
Mm-hm.

01:08:18.431 --> 01:08:19.891
I was up all night.

01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:22.060
Me, too.

01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:23.436
Don't go.

01:08:25.438 --> 01:08:26.856
I think it's better this way.

01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:29.109
I clearly make
a mess of everything.

01:08:30.318 --> 01:08:33.405
I'm so sorry about what I said.

01:08:33.446 --> 01:08:36.741
It's just been hard
these past few years.

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:38.410
I know.

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:40.787
I miss my little sister.

01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:44.582
No, I'm sorry, too.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.044
I've just been
completely wrapped up

01:08:48.086 --> 01:08:50.797
in my own little world trying
to make a name for myself.

01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:54.426
And then when Dad got sick,

01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:58.054
I just buried myself
deeper in work.

01:08:58.096 --> 01:08:59.514
I couldn't face the truth.

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:03.977
Everyone deals with
grief differently.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.440
I just wanted to
make you guys proud.

01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:12.193
To prove that I was
capable of greatness.

01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:14.988
You did do that.

01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.865
But at what cost?

01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:19.492
Seeing you guys
a few times a year?

01:09:19.534 --> 01:09:22.162
Having no
meaningful relationships?

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:25.749
I wasn't even there at
the end when he needed me most.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.209
Don't beat yourself up, okay?

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.712
Dad knows how much you love him.

01:09:30.754 --> 01:09:33.548
Yeah, Spencer was right.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.717
What do you mean?

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:39.346
(groaning)
We got in this huge fight.

01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:41.181
I've ruined
everything between us.

01:09:42.682 --> 01:09:44.559
Not to mention
tomorrow's Christmas Eve

01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.978
and I don't have anything
for the fashion show.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.065
So fix it.

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:51.316
How?

01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:53.151
I don't know, but I'll help.

01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:56.654
I'm a pretty excellent sewer,
in case you forgot.

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.408
Come on!

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.160
Dad wouldn't want
you to give up.

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.120
I just don't know.

01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.543
Wait.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:12.671
I have an idea.

01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.676
This?

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.594
What do you think?

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:21.304
- Uh, no.
- Okay, okay.

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:23.848
It doesn't seem good.
All right.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.725
Oh.

01:10:27.977 --> 01:10:30.188
Char.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.523
Oh!

01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:33.650
That's perfect.

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:35.026
- I love it.
- Yeah?

01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:36.027
Yeah, let's do it.

01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:37.237
Yay!

01:10:39.572 --> 01:10:41.741
Charlotte, I--

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:44.035
I'm so glad
that you're here.

01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:45.286
We thought you left.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:49.124
Oh, Char.
You're still here.

01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:52.002
Look, I know I haven't been
the greatest sister

01:10:52.043 --> 01:10:54.671
or daughter,
or step-daughter.

01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:58.717
But I want to try harder.

01:10:58.758 --> 01:11:00.927
I really want to be
a part of this family.

01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:04.889
I just miss Dad.

01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:08.226
And sometimes it's really hard
for me to accept that he's gone.

01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:11.896
Oh, it's hard for us, too,

01:11:11.938 --> 01:11:15.650
but he will always be
a part of this family.

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:16.985
No matter what.

01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:21.406
I know.

01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:24.617
And I'm sorry
I've been so hard on you.

01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:27.287
I never wanted you to
think that I was trying

01:11:27.328 --> 01:11:28.663
to replace your dad.

01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:30.623
I had great respect for him.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.085
He was a dear friend.

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.962
I know.

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:37.756
And you've been
nothing but kind,

01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:39.632
and you've made my mom so happy.

01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:42.302
And I've been nothing
but rude to you.

01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:45.638
And you don't deserve that.

01:11:46.806 --> 01:11:48.600
I hope you can forgive me.

01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:50.143
Of course, Charlotte.

01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:53.646
Call me Charlie.

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:59.569
This really feels like
a group hug kind of moment.

01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:01.321
- Yes!
- (laughing)

01:12:01.363 --> 01:12:02.864
Aww.

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:05.283
Oh, so, what's with
all the new fabric?

01:12:05.325 --> 01:12:08.328
Oh, well, I am going to
make Christmas coveralls for

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.246
the Warwick's Fashion Show.

01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:12.916
Each pair is going to come
with its own embroidery set

01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:14.709
for each person to
sew their name into.

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:16.378
Just like real coveralls.

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:20.298
Isn't the fashion show tomorrow?

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:23.635
Yes, which is why
we need all hands on deck.

01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:25.929
Ah, okay.

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.932
Wh-- What do we do?
Okay, let's go!

01:12:28.973 --> 01:12:32.894
(whirring)

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:44.698
*

01:12:48.535 --> 01:12:50.745
These are turning out great.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.038
I want a pair.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:52.914
(laughing)

01:12:52.956 --> 01:12:54.541
Agreed. I'd actually wear these.

01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:56.668
Don't worry,
by this time next year,

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:58.461
you can all buy
them at Warwick's.

01:12:58.503 --> 01:13:01.339
Maybe, but either way I'd be
happy to make you each a pair.

01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:06.469
Mm-hm. Well, the women's pair
is pretty much done.

01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:08.596
Great. Is there anything else I
can do?

01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:11.391
Uh, do you guys
think we have time to

01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:14.352
make an extra pair of men's?

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:15.854
- Backup, great idea.
- Mm.

01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:18.606
Actually, I had
something else in mind.

01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:20.025
Here you go.

01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.318
Thank you.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.486
Wish me luck.

01:13:24.904 --> 01:13:26.322
Ah, we love you, Charlie.

01:13:26.364 --> 01:13:28.074
Aw, I love you guys, too.

01:13:28.116 --> 01:13:30.827
If you don't make it back in
time for Pajamboree don't worry.

01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:33.121
Just as long as we get
you on Christmas morning.

01:13:33.163 --> 01:13:35.457
I will make it back,
mark my words.

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.583
'Kay.

01:13:36.624 --> 01:13:38.001
Thanks for everything.

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:39.044
Got it.

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:39.878
Here.

01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:42.213
Knock 'em dead, honey.

01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:43.381
I'll try.

01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:44.841
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:13:52.682 --> 01:13:55.393
Hey.

01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:56.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:58.938 --> 01:14:00.732
Shouldn't you be
on your way to New York?

01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:03.985
Uh, I wanted to
give you this before I left.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.407
It's the new design.

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:15.080
Thanks.

01:14:15.121 --> 01:14:18.792
And I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:23.922
This last week with you has been

01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:26.383
the happiest
I've felt in a while.

01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:28.927
And I mean that.

01:14:28.968 --> 01:14:35.600
*

01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:38.311
Anyway, um,
if I don't see you later...

01:14:40.647 --> 01:14:41.898
Merry Christmas, Spencer.

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:45.819
Merry Christmas, Charlotte.

01:14:49.239 --> 01:14:59.207
*

01:15:09.634 --> 01:15:10.969
(sighing)

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:27.360
*

01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:29.362
(sighing)

01:15:29.404 --> 01:15:30.864
Roger: Charlotte.

01:15:30.905 --> 01:15:33.241
- Hi.
- Welcome.

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.201
Can you take that for me?
Thanks.

01:15:35.243 --> 01:15:36.619
Can't wait to see
what you brought us.

01:15:36.661 --> 01:15:38.038
Oh, thank you, Roger.

01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:40.498
Um, I thought we were
getting started at 2:00.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.001
You didn't get the email? No.

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.670
We pushed it to 3:00.

01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.006
But at this rate it's probably
going to be more like 3:30.

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.175
What? But it's Christmas Eve.

01:15:52.135 --> 01:15:54.012
Sorry, Charlotte.
You know how these things go.

01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:57.974
You'll be out of here by 5:30,
the latest.

01:15:58.016 --> 01:16:00.060
I have an event tonight with
my family at 8:00,

01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:02.103
and it'll take
four hours to get there,

01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:04.314
and Christmas traffic
it'll probably take longer.

01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:06.983
I'm sure your family
will understand.

01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:08.902
Wow. Would you look at these.

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:11.404
These are great.

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.908
I really can't wait
for everyone to see them.

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:18.328
Well, unfortunately, they won't.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:20.205
What do you mean?

01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:23.875
Would you guys mind going
and taking these off

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.418
and bringing them to me
as quick as you can?

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.923
Please, right now.
Bring them to me. Thank you.

01:16:29.964 --> 01:16:33.760
I'm sorry, Roger. I have
somewhere else I have to be.

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:37.931
Charlotte, you do know this show
could be a game-changed for you.

01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:41.685
I know, but family has
to come first this time.

01:16:41.726 --> 01:16:43.269
I hope you'll forgive me, Roger.

01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:44.771
I would love to
have designed for you,

01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:46.815
but maybe next year?

01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:48.441
Merry Christmas.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:50.652
Merry Christmas.

01:16:52.278 --> 01:17:02.247
*

01:17:12.882 --> 01:17:14.801
* It's in the air *

01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:17.387
* That Christmas feeling *

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:20.557
Man on megaphone: Welcome to
the final night of Elfcapades!

01:17:20.598 --> 01:17:22.225
The Pajamboree.

01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:24.769
* And hang the stockings *

01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:28.481
(cheering)

01:17:28.523 --> 01:17:30.066
(applauding)

01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:32.652
It's so beautiful.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:33.903
You're here!

01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.655
Rick & Dee Dee:
Merry Christmas.

01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:36.990
Merry Christmas, Dee Dee.

01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:38.658
Oh, it's so soft. (laughing)

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.035
Any word yet?

01:17:40.076 --> 01:17:41.494
Oh, just a text
a couple of hours ago

01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:42.662
that she was on her way.

01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:43.872
- Good.
- Mm-hm.

01:17:43.913 --> 01:17:45.290
Yeah.

01:17:45.331 --> 01:17:46.750
(cranking)

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:51.755
(phone ringing)

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.556
Come on, pick up.

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:04.976
Voicemail: Hi, this is Spencer.
Leave a message

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:06.853
and I'll get back to you.

01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:08.188
Spencer, it's me.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.565
(phone vibrating)

01:18:17.405 --> 01:18:19.199
Charlotte: Spencer, it's me.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.868
I can't stop thinking
about the way we left things.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:25.038
I am so sorry if
I ever made you feel

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.040
small or less-than.

01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:29.084
You are the most
incredible person,

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:30.877
and the only thing that
matters to me right now

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.587
is making things right with us,

01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:34.464
and as crazy as it sounds--
(static buzzing)

01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:37.008
--it might be--
(static buzzing)

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.426
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:40.345
--hope that you decide--
(static buzzing)

01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:41.554
--night.

01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:53.191
*

01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:57.737
(horn honking, tires squealing)

01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:03.827
*

01:19:03.868 --> 01:19:06.621
I am so sorry.

01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:10.041
But I'm really happy
to see you.

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.376
Are you?
'Cause, you know,

01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:13.128
two accidents,
it starts to look intentional.

01:19:13.169 --> 01:19:14.462
(laughing)

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.299
How did the show go?

01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:22.387
It didn't.

01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:23.596
I left.

01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:25.015
You left?!

01:19:25.056 --> 01:19:27.600
I promised my family
I'd be here.

01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:30.020
And if there was any small
possibility

01:19:30.061 --> 01:19:32.397
that I could see you,
I had to take it.

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:37.068
But Roger should see
the new designs. It's perfect.

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:39.904
I don't care about
any of that right now.

01:19:39.946 --> 01:19:42.615
I care about you.

01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:44.617
Really?

01:19:44.659 --> 01:19:47.787
I know it sounds crazy.

01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:50.707
But spending this past week
with you has made me realize

01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:54.878
that the only important thing in
life is who you spend it with.

01:19:54.919 --> 01:19:57.922
And I want to spend
every moment I can with you.

01:20:01.217 --> 01:20:02.594
Charlotte, I, uh...

01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:05.472
I love you, Spencer.

01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:07.682
And it's okay if you
don't feel the same way

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:09.392
or you're not ready.

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:13.313
But I didn't want to
regret not telling you that.

01:20:16.816 --> 01:20:17.776
Well, you're in luck.

01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:20.862
'Cause I love you too.

01:20:22.864 --> 01:20:23.865
Really?

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:25.492
Completely.

01:20:25.533 --> 01:20:35.543
*

01:20:39.172 --> 01:20:41.007
What now?

01:20:41.049 --> 01:20:42.759
Now?

01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:44.344
We go dance it up in style.

01:20:45.637 --> 01:20:46.554
(laughing)

01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:50.892
- Yes!
- (laughing)

01:20:50.934 --> 01:20:52.018
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.603
Let's do it.

01:20:53.645 --> 01:20:59.693
*

01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:01.861
Charlie!

01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:04.197
(both laughing)

01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:05.532
- You made it!
- Yes!

01:21:05.573 --> 01:21:07.909
Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:10.328
How did the show go?

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.996
I ditched it.

01:21:12.038 --> 01:21:13.415
You what?

01:21:13.456 --> 01:21:15.750
Being here with
you guys matters to me most.

01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:16.793
Aww.

01:21:16.835 --> 01:21:18.753
Oh, hold on.

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.381
It's-- It's Roger.

01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:24.592
Probably calling to give me
the old Christmas Eve scolding.

01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.012
Hello?

01:21:27.053 --> 01:21:28.763
There's my all-star.

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:30.557
Pardon? What do you mean?

01:21:30.598 --> 01:21:33.143
You know, that was really bold,
what you did.

01:21:33.184 --> 01:21:35.061
Giving up on your dream
to be with your family.

01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:37.731
I respect that. I really do.

01:21:37.772 --> 01:21:39.941
And that's exactly the type
of person I want designing

01:21:39.983 --> 01:21:41.609
for my home and family brand.

01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:44.070
Not to mention
the fact I can't stop

01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:45.822
thinking about those coveralls.

01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:47.657
They are fantastic.

01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:48.867
Are you serious?

01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:50.535
I am.

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:53.246
We want exclusive rights to
sell them in all of our stores,

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:55.290
and I want to offer you
a one-year contract to

01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:57.792
design for us exclusively.
What do you think of that?

01:21:57.834 --> 01:21:59.586
(gasping)

01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:02.422
I mean, yes. That's incredible.

01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:05.300
I would love to.
Um, there's just one thing.

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:06.634
Roger: What's that?

01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:08.511
I'd like to move
Alistair's headquarters

01:22:08.553 --> 01:22:10.972
to Brooksbend, Connecticut.

01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:12.932
As long as you can be in
New York a couple times a month

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:15.143
for meetings, you can
design wherever you like.

01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:17.312
Then you have yourself a deal.

01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:19.272
Roger: Perfect. I'll give you
a call in the New Year,

01:22:19.314 --> 01:22:21.274
we'll go over the paperwork.

01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:22.567
Merry Christmas, Charlotte.

01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:24.069
Merry Christmas, Mr. Warwick.

01:22:25.945 --> 01:22:26.905
I won!

01:22:26.946 --> 01:22:30.116
(all cheering)

01:22:30.158 --> 01:22:31.368
You did it.

01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:32.786
No, we did it.

01:22:32.827 --> 01:22:34.454
I never could have
done this without you.

01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:38.124
Merry Christmas,
Charlotte Carmichael.

01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.292
Ben, you wanna dance?

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:40.543
- Oh yeah!
- All right!

01:22:40.585 --> 01:22:43.672
(all laughing, chatting)

01:22:43.713 --> 01:22:50.887
*

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:52.013
* Bells are ringing *

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:55.308
* There's a magic in the air *

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:56.976
* Choirs are singing *

01:22:57.018 --> 01:23:00.146
* Full of joy
and happiness *

01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:01.731
* Stars are bright *

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:03.942
* As we share
a winter's night *

01:23:03.983 --> 01:23:05.860
* Here's to Christmas *

01:23:07.862 --> 01:23:09.864
* Everybody feel
the magic in the air *

01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:15.328
* Everybody, whoa-oh *

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.956
* Everybody, everybody *
