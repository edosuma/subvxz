00:12.260 --> 00:14.060
So, dropping the design class

00:14.080 --> 00:15.440
I was taking with Luca

00:15.460 --> 00:18.980
seemed to lift the pressure
off of me, my relationship,

00:19.040 --> 00:21.540
and honestly life in general.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.160
I may not have found my genius yet,

00:24.320 --> 00:27.060
but Luca and I finally found our stride.

00:37.940 --> 00:39.260
- Hi!
- What's up, baby?

00:39.310 --> 00:40.360
I have a surprise for you.

00:40.380 --> 00:41.730
I have a surprise for you, too.

00:41.770 --> 00:42.939
Aww! Okay.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.020
Then let's do it together. Same time.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.960
- One... two... three.
- We're counting?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.119
- I got you a ring holder...
- Michelle Obama is coming...

00:49.120 --> 00:51.120
- ... for when you sleep over!
- ... to our design class.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.040
What'd you just say
about Michelle Obama?

00:53.080 --> 00:55.279
- You got me a ring holder?
- Yeah. Um...

00:55.280 --> 00:57.340
What is this? Velvet? Look
at the craftsmanship.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.340
- This is crazy.
- Luca...

00:59.480 --> 01:01.550
what did you just say
about Michelle Obama?

01:01.580 --> 01:02.740
You know, Michelle supports

01:02.750 --> 01:04.780
independent designers, like Jason Wu,

01:04.790 --> 01:06.500
and she was gonna stop by the lab

01:06.520 --> 01:08.740
to see if any of our projects
really caught her eye.

01:08.750 --> 01:09.759
Michelle?

01:09.760 --> 01:11.380
- A-Am I saying it wrong?
- Okay.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.660
So, she's visiting the
class I just dropped?

01:14.680 --> 01:16.480
Yeah. Kinda hyped.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.220
But I would love to have
you come by the lab

01:18.240 --> 01:19.920
and help me get my designs together.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.830
This is... crazy.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.240
I know. It's fire.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, fire.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.980
Like super, flamethrower.

01:27.990 --> 01:31.880
Like, opportunity of a lifetime for you.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.180
It's official. I've just ruined my life.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.300
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

02:14.880 --> 02:16.820
Did you just finish my banana bread?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.920
- No.
- Oh.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.480
Maybe.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.720
We might have more coming.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.640
So it might not be done entirely.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.440
That was so good.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.630
_

02:28.640 --> 02:30.440
- _
- Mmm.

02:32.070 --> 02:33.260
- Okay, guys.
- Mm?

02:33.300 --> 02:34.839
You will never guess what happened.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.000
- You're pregnant.
- You're pregnant.

02:36.020 --> 02:37.030
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

02:37.040 --> 02:40.040
No! Just that I have
totally ruined my life.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.660
Yeah, babies tend to do that.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.800
Aww, you guys are gonna have
the most self-absorbed baby

02:44.820 --> 02:47.060
with the most luxurious head of hair.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.660
Guys, I am not pregnant.
But you are trying?

02:49.700 --> 02:51.110
No. Are you guys high?

02:51.150 --> 02:52.460
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.150
- Jinx again!
- Jinx again!

02:54.200 --> 02:55.680
I'm being serious.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.220
I literally made the
biggest mistake of my life

02:58.240 --> 02:59.599
by dropping that design lab.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.960
Like, at first I thought I was
gonna be okay with my decision,

03:01.980 --> 03:04.020
but now I'm totally
regretting everything.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.520
But didn't you drop the lab

03:05.550 --> 03:07.280
because you didn't want
to design anymore?

03:07.300 --> 03:09.320
Yeah, but that was before

03:09.380 --> 03:12.440
Michelle Obama was coming to the class.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.800
Oh, my God. My forever-FLOTUS

03:13.840 --> 03:15.100
- is coming here?
- Yes.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.680
She's coming to anoint the
next hottest designer.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.959
And you know all she has to do

03:18.960 --> 03:21.100
is, like, give them one IG shout out

03:21.110 --> 03:22.600
and they become an instant success.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.320
Wait, so you're just regretting
dropping your design class

03:25.330 --> 03:27.300
because there's a chance for notoriety?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.880
No, it's that I'll be

03:28.900 --> 03:31.280
helping my boyfriend on his rise to fame

03:31.300 --> 03:33.700
instead of attaining said
notoriety for myself.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.520
Got to be honest, this sounds

03:35.540 --> 03:36.819
a little like your ego talking.

03:36.820 --> 03:37.920
- Mm.
- How?

03:37.940 --> 03:40.490
All I want to do is meet Michelle Obama,

03:40.530 --> 03:42.160
or, you know what, more importantly

03:42.180 --> 03:43.520
have her meet me so she knows that I am

03:43.540 --> 03:45.380
the best thing that has
ever happened in her life.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.640
How is that ego?

03:46.680 --> 03:48.440
Personally, I think you need

03:48.460 --> 03:50.300
to rip a page out of Michelle's book

03:50.320 --> 03:52.460
- and go support your man.
- Mm.

03:52.470 --> 03:55.000
This is an incredible
opportunity for Luca.

03:55.050 --> 03:56.840
Help him shine.

04:01.010 --> 04:04.500
My friends are as right
as they are high.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.660
Which means they're very right.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.340
I have to step out of
my ego, go help my boo,

04:10.400 --> 04:12.900
and, you know, roll
confidently with my decision.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.440
You have to let me back
into the design lab!

04:15.500 --> 04:18.019
Now, you know I would
do anything for you.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.180
You've done nothing for me.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.680
Well, all that's gonna change.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.160
But not today.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.220
The add/drop period is over.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.400
This is a very serious university.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.840
Hey, my man, you, uh...

04:29.860 --> 04:31.240
you brought the Tend Skin, right?

04:31.280 --> 04:33.320
- Yep.
- Okay, cool.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.250
Your boy gets bumpy sometimes.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.540
Gross.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.380
Yes. Yes, it is.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.040
All right, look, if I knew that

04:40.060 --> 04:41.780
the former First Lady was coming,

04:41.800 --> 04:43.800
I would have never dropped the class.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.120
And if I'd have known the future
Mrs. Obama-Telphy was coming,

04:47.140 --> 04:48.540
I would've got lined up sooner.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.640
She will be my wife.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.709
Hey, my man, you think you can
give me a line in the back?

04:53.710 --> 04:54.719
Yeah.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.530
Oh! Oh! Or... Or... Or...
a Chicago Bulls logo.

04:58.570 --> 05:00.300
My girl... she's from Chicago...

05:00.320 --> 05:02.410
so I know she's gonna appreciate that.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.940
Now, she's still kickin'
it with dude, right?

05:07.870 --> 05:09.220
President Obama?

05:11.080 --> 05:13.289
- Sorry, guys.
- She looks thirsty as hell.

05:13.290 --> 05:14.299
Ugh.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.339
I'd trample any of you

05:15.340 --> 05:16.440
- to get her a glass of water.
- Oh, yeah.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.620
What's the point of us waking
up at 4:00 a.m. to train

05:18.630 --> 05:20.540
if all the school needs to sell tickets

05:20.560 --> 05:22.380
- is a THOT in a jersey?
- Wait a second.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.460
How do you know Chastity Decas
doesn't wake up at 4:00 a.m.?

05:24.470 --> 05:26.480
Please, if she was a serious athlete,

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
she'd be worried about her jump shot

05:28.020 --> 05:30.080
- and not her damn double D's.
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.030
Female athletes already
have to fight so hard

05:32.040 --> 05:33.200
to be taken seriously

05:33.260 --> 05:35.060
and now you got a skank
licking a basketball.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.930
Wait. So, you have zero issues
with Vaseline-faced Cash,

05:37.940 --> 05:39.979
but have a problem with this beautiful,

05:39.980 --> 05:42.439
Black, bottle-shaped queen?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.160
It just sounds like a
double standard to me.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.480
You mad.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.220
Like, shouldn't you support her ability

05:47.240 --> 05:48.440
to be able to play ball

05:48.470 --> 05:50.960
and use her sexuality
in an empowered way?

05:50.980 --> 05:52.420
You know what? Matter of
fact, instead of clowning,

05:52.440 --> 05:53.720
you guys should come with
us to the game later.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.940
Y'all are going to a
women's basketball game?

05:56.020 --> 05:59.140
No, no, no. We're going to
Chastity Decas' basketball game.

05:59.180 --> 06:00.480
- That's...
- All of that.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.360
I mean, don't you guys want to support

06:02.400 --> 06:06.040
your fellow female Black athlete?

06:06.060 --> 06:08.620
- Oh, you play dirty, bitch.
- Fine.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.299
I mean, I'm sure we can
sit through a few hours

06:10.300 --> 06:11.420
of some boring-ass lay-ups

06:11.460 --> 06:13.799
and poorly executed pick and rolls.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.800
What, only guys are

06:16.820 --> 06:18.560
allowed to make fun of
women's basketball?

06:18.600 --> 06:19.659
Well, at least it's not

06:19.660 --> 06:21.080
- one of your track meets.
- Yeah.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.680
Up top!

06:22.700 --> 06:24.100
No?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.520
Pfft, you mad!

06:27.020 --> 06:29.690
_

06:33.180 --> 06:35.980
- _
- Mm.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.450
It felt bittersweet to be
back in the Cal U design lab.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.740
I hadn't been back since
I dropped the class,

06:46.790 --> 06:49.580
and I forgot how magical it was.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.460
Look at my old workspace.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.860
Sitting there... all
abandoned and dusty.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.740
You know what? No. No. No.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.000
I am not doing that,

07:06.020 --> 07:08.400
because I have come to
terms with my decision,

07:08.420 --> 07:10.060
and I'm here to support my man.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.190
Just look at him.

07:14.230 --> 07:16.980
He's so in his element.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.700
How could I not want to support that?

07:21.420 --> 07:22.700
Hey, babe!

07:22.740 --> 07:24.570
Got your favorite... dirty chai latte.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.490
Did you forget the rules?
There's no liquids in here.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.799
Uh, yeah. No, sorry. I... guess I did.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.200
No need to apologize.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.660
It was a sweet idea. Thank you.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.100
I haven't even been here for one minute,

07:39.120 --> 07:42.820
and he's already throwing
my ideas in the trash.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.140
Dope.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.959
While suppressing my envy

07:48.960 --> 07:51.000
of Luca's chance to
have his designs seen

07:51.020 --> 07:53.310
by America's Queen, Michelle Obama,

07:53.350 --> 07:55.340
I was trying my very best to let

07:55.360 --> 07:57.740
the supportive-girlfriend
side of me shine...

07:57.780 --> 08:01.020
But Luca's attitude was
making it very, very hard.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.440
Can you go right to left, please?

08:03.480 --> 08:04.920
I'm sorry, what?

08:04.940 --> 08:08.080
The way you're steaming... I
need you to go right to left.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.020
Like Arabic?

08:13.170 --> 08:15.059
Can't take it personal.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.880
He is under a lot of pressure and,

08:17.920 --> 08:21.700
in his defense, the Arabs
did invent steaming.

08:25.550 --> 08:27.140
They're beautiful.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.390
It almost reminds me

08:28.430 --> 08:31.480
of Alexander McQueen's 1997 collection.

08:31.730 --> 08:33.299
Was it Plato is Atlantis?

08:33.320 --> 08:34.799
Are you calling me derivative?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.559
Uh... no. Of course not.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.879
But everybody's inspired by somebody.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.100
I mean, wasn't it Picasso who said,

08:41.120 --> 08:43.740
"good artists copy,
great artists steal"?

08:43.780 --> 08:45.660
Okay. So, now I'm a thief?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.640
That's not what I said.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.100
Zoey, please...

08:50.160 --> 08:51.960
help me...

08:51.980 --> 08:54.940
help you... help me.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.080
It's all good.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.399
It is all good,

09:03.400 --> 09:07.840
'cause when he goes low, I'll go high.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.380
There's actually a good
number of people here.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.540
Way more than our track meets.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.230
I get a bigger line of
people outside my door

09:15.270 --> 09:16.500
on Shroom Sunday.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.560
See? Look.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.580
Just another player doing her thing.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.660
Gotta go slo-mo mode for this.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.370
Mm! Look at that. The
woman has got skill.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.409
You got to admit, she has skill.

09:34.410 --> 09:36.119
One jumper with no one guarding her

09:36.120 --> 09:37.130
means nothing.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.260
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

09:42.380 --> 09:45.160
Oh! That... That is something.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.640
This is some bullshit.

09:47.660 --> 09:49.340
These thirst buckets are going crazy,

09:49.350 --> 09:50.920
and the game hasn't even started yet.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.939
Yes, yes, but we...

09:52.940 --> 09:54.220
We have already won.

09:54.270 --> 09:55.560
How do I do the slo-mo?

10:01.020 --> 10:03.740
It's coming, but something's
not quite right yet.

10:05.820 --> 10:09.400
I feel like a dog that won't
stop chewing its own butt.

10:09.820 --> 10:13.300
Hey, uh, babe, sorry,
but don't you think

10:13.320 --> 10:17.159
this collar/dress combo may
be a little avant-garde

10:17.160 --> 10:19.020
for Ms. Michelle Obama?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.750
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

10:21.780 --> 10:23.960
Okay, you have to remember
that this is a woman

10:24.000 --> 10:26.050
who wore J. Crew to an inauguration.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.720
So you may want to adapt a little

10:27.740 --> 10:28.990
to fit the taste of your audience?

10:29.010 --> 10:32.580
Make it more straightforward?
More simple?

10:32.620 --> 10:34.260
Hmm.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.900
Right.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.620
You want me to mass-produce

10:37.630 --> 10:40.040
some Mercantile cap-sleeve Midi dress

10:40.060 --> 10:41.840
in a goofy-ass dragonfly print

10:41.860 --> 10:44.760
and sell it for $74.99 to sorority girls

10:44.770 --> 10:46.580
who can't afford Michael Kors?

10:46.660 --> 10:48.940
Well, you know that's not what I meant.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.739
I'm not here to pander to the mainstream

10:50.740 --> 10:52.500
or give off a two-bit
department store vibe.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.599
- I want to be original.
- I just think it's important

10:54.600 --> 10:56.160
to give people what they want.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.620
I'm not here to give
people what they want.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.920
I'm here to give people what they need,

10:58.940 --> 11:00.780
and I'm not gonna be thinking small.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.699
Wow.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.140
Just as soon as I thought
Luca and I hit our stride,

11:05.180 --> 11:07.280
he shows me a side of him
I've never seen before,

11:07.300 --> 11:09.440
and this side sucks.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.680
I get you're trying to help...

11:12.720 --> 11:13.860
but I think I need some alone time.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.300
Mm, happily.

11:15.350 --> 11:16.850
How do I...

11:27.300 --> 11:30.959
It just feels so much
better to go low sometimes.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.860
Chastity!

11:39.900 --> 11:41.870
Good "D."

11:41.920 --> 11:45.290
Do you see what I mean?
This isn't about talent.

11:45.340 --> 11:47.599
The girl with the
ittie-bitties got 27 points,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.799
and the girl with the tig ol'
bitties got four points,

11:49.800 --> 11:50.960
but she's the one with the banner.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.970
Damn. This girl's making bank.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.680
I mean, she's got sponsors
for Flat Tummy Tea,

11:54.700 --> 11:56.699
Fashion Nova, and what?!
And The Container Store?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.600
This is easily a 10K-a-month feed.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.200
Ugh. We get it.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.560
You a ho at the beach,
the gym, and Petco.

12:02.570 --> 12:03.980
Why is she even playing basketball

12:03.990 --> 12:05.340
when she's making this type of bank?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.659
Social media is a living organism.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.380
You know, one thing
feeds off the others.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.399
Basketball is part of Chastity's image,

12:10.400 --> 12:13.140
and these days, my friends,
everything is about brand.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.250
And your guys' Insta feed
is literally pictures

12:15.280 --> 12:16.570
of you and your dad eating donuts.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.440
So what? I'm supposed
to be like Chastity

12:18.470 --> 12:19.479
and straddle a hurdle?

12:19.480 --> 12:21.160
Yeah, there is no way I'm going to Petco

12:21.180 --> 12:23.200
just to press my ass
cheeks on some fish tanks.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.380
Oh, real life, though, that'll
get you a lot of likes.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.950
- Give me my phone!
- What the idiot is trying to say here is,

12:27.960 --> 12:30.560
a little more sexy gets
you a few more followers,

12:30.570 --> 12:31.860
which brings a few more spectators,

12:31.880 --> 12:33.959
which then gets you the
banner above the library,

12:33.960 --> 12:36.340
then brings endorsements
from... you guessed it...

12:36.440 --> 12:38.840
wait for it... The Container Store.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.280
You know what I mean?

12:41.340 --> 12:42.540
So...

12:42.600 --> 12:45.880
I was aiming for my mouth.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.280
My mouth.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.700
Well...

12:49.580 --> 12:51.780
Oh, my God!

12:51.820 --> 12:53.580
What are you doing here?

12:53.620 --> 12:56.059
I live here, and also,

12:56.060 --> 12:58.799
how can you two possibly
still be this high?

12:58.800 --> 13:01.120
I thought you were supposed
to be helping Luca.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.840
Or was that yesterday?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.840
I left because, apparently,

13:04.850 --> 13:06.519
not only am I not good at design,

13:06.520 --> 13:09.020
well, I'm also not good at
being a supportive girlfriend.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.139
I mean, at this point, I'm wondering,

13:10.140 --> 13:12.260
"What the hell am I good at?"

13:12.380 --> 13:14.600
Well, you're getting pretty
good at quitting stuff.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.820
Yeah, you should play to your strengths.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.419
I'm being serious.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.620
He found fault in everything I did.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.579
I chewed my gum too loud,

13:22.580 --> 13:25.140
my head wasn't tall enough,

13:25.220 --> 13:28.060
and I didn't steam in the
direction of the Qur'an.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
But Lil Luca's under a lot of pressure

13:30.120 --> 13:33.000
- right now, Zo.
- And he is the moody, genius artist

13:33.010 --> 13:34.260
you signed up for.

13:34.270 --> 13:36.940
Well, I'm going to
give that moody genius

13:36.960 --> 13:38.660
as much space as he needs

13:38.680 --> 13:41.680
until after Michelle Obama
sees his old, wack ass

13:41.690 --> 13:43.520
Elizabethan pet cone dress,

13:43.540 --> 13:45.840
which would be more appropriate
for "Bo," their dog,

13:45.880 --> 13:48.440
not the greatest first
lady this... this country

13:48.470 --> 13:50.360
and world has ever known!

13:50.600 --> 13:52.250
Here. Come here.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.600
We'll be your supportive girlfriends.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.090
Yeah, let's do it.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.199
_

14:03.200 --> 14:05.080
What are you gonna do?

14:05.700 --> 14:08.540
I guess I'll go see if my cone fits.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.460
Hey...

14:14.230 --> 14:15.940
Oh, my God.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.840
What happened?!

14:17.920 --> 14:19.600
I quit.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.740
Luca, you cannot quit.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.800
I mean, come on. That's... my thing.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.120
Fine.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.319
You can sit here and pout all you want,

14:31.320 --> 14:33.920
but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.739
and there's only one
genius in this class,

14:36.740 --> 14:38.040
and it's you.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.040
I hate that word.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.560
"Genius"? But... you are.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.659
Just stop saying that.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.620
It's the label that's got me messed up.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.090
Okay, well, whether people
call you that or not,

14:51.100 --> 14:52.600
it's true.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
And, I mean, dude,

14:54.220 --> 14:56.360
I get that you're overwhelmed right now,

14:56.440 --> 15:01.280
but watching you work... it's inspiring.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.600
Your passion,

15:02.620 --> 15:04.660
your love of design... all of it.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.880
I mean...

15:05.980 --> 15:08.030
I wish I had something
that flows out of me

15:08.040 --> 15:10.180
as naturally as that does for you.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.180
I appreciate that.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.280
I mean, it's not flowing right now.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.700
Well, that's because
you're in your head,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.300
which is what happens
to all great artists.

15:21.890 --> 15:25.440
You... You gotta gift, you.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.560
- Yes, you do.
- What are you doing?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.520
My best De Niro.

15:30.940 --> 15:32.460
You're mad goofy.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.199
Okay, well, seriously, the
one thing I actually do know

15:36.200 --> 15:37.770
are my designers,

15:37.780 --> 15:39.500
and you're a great one.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.800
So, how about we get this done?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.480
Let's get it.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.680
Something's still missing.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.320
Maybe just sleep on it.

16:13.310 --> 16:15.000
Thanks for your help tonight.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.960
Yeah. Of course.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.570
You coming?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.200
Uh, yeah, in a sec.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.540
Girl, you are obsessed.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.960
Chastity has over 200,000 followers.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.660
So do all those other Insta hoes.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.360
All I see now is opportunity.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.379
I mean, come on. We're
just as cute as her.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.879
Plus, there's two of us. It's just math.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.400
I want to be recognized
for my athletic ability.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.180
Not... my perfect... body!

16:51.200 --> 16:53.430
Well, we're not getting
recognized for either right now,

16:53.440 --> 16:55.019
so we might as well switch up our image.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.029
Not doing it.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.600
There's literally nothing you could say

16:57.620 --> 16:58.860
that'll make me change my mind, so...

16:58.880 --> 17:00.740
YG follows her.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.659
You play dirty, bitch.

17:08.369 --> 17:10.660
Uh... w-what are you doing?

17:10.700 --> 17:11.800
Hi.

17:11.839 --> 17:12.980
Good morning.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.160
So, um, I had a little
inspiration last night.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.940
If you hate it, all easily removable.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.619
The... The... The... The jacket,
the tulle, all of it...

17:21.640 --> 17:22.780
can take it right off.

17:22.790 --> 17:26.800
But I just thought it was
cool, so I, um... yeah.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.019
- This is you?
- Yes, and I...

17:29.020 --> 17:30.470
I shouldn't have styled it without you,

17:30.500 --> 17:32.180
so I'm sorry about that.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.660
No. It's...

17:38.300 --> 17:39.439
It's perfect.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.480
Oh, my God! Thank you!

17:41.520 --> 17:44.760
While Michelle Obama was
checking out students' design,

17:44.780 --> 17:46.080
those of us on the outside

17:46.100 --> 17:47.620
were trying to catch a glimpse of her.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.780
Mrs. Obama!

18:00.840 --> 18:03.540
I was really happy for Luca. I was.

18:03.590 --> 18:05.279
I was sure he'd shine in there,

18:05.280 --> 18:07.260
and I couldn't have been prouder.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.640
But also, if I was being
completely honest with myself,

18:10.720 --> 18:12.800
I couldn't help but feel
like I'd missed out.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.200
_

18:20.640 --> 18:22.060
Showtime.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.400
Here we go.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.260
Hey.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.420
So?

18:36.660 --> 18:38.250
She loved it.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.099
Oh, my... I knew she would.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.620
I knew she would!

18:41.670 --> 18:43.840
I am so happy for you.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.500
You deserve it.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.920
All right, what?

18:49.660 --> 18:51.930
Okay. What's that?

18:52.020 --> 18:53.940
- I got a surprise for you.
- Yeah?

18:56.140 --> 18:58.640
Oh, how sweet. My left shoe.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.160
Needed that... I was
gonna wear it tomorrow.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.160
Turn it over.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.600
"Zoey, fantastic work!
Best, Michelle... "

19:08.530 --> 19:10.860
Michelle?

19:11.180 --> 19:13.410
What?

19:13.450 --> 19:16.020
Yeah, she loved the
dress, which was fire,

19:16.040 --> 19:19.000
but she immediately pointed out
the styling, which was you.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.820
Luca, thank you.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.270
I know you really wanted to meet her,

19:23.280 --> 19:25.080
so I hope this is...

19:25.130 --> 19:27.240
a decent consolation until you do.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.010
I genuinely don't know what to say.

19:30.050 --> 19:31.670
How about you say you're a genius,

19:31.720 --> 19:34.800
'cause your styling was...
and 'cause you are.

19:34.850 --> 19:36.799
I thought you hated that word.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.930
When it fits, it fits, you know?

19:38.980 --> 19:41.180
Oh, my God. Thank you.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.520
These are for you.

19:46.570 --> 19:50.040
Obviously, roses were, of
course, too predictable,

19:50.060 --> 19:53.950
so I opted for red tulips...

19:53.990 --> 19:56.419
with a black, heart-shaped stigma

19:56.420 --> 20:00.500
in the center to symbolize my heart...

20:00.540 --> 20:02.920
darkened by passion.

20:03.080 --> 20:08.720
Passion for you, Ms. Michelle Obama...

20:08.780 --> 20:10.210
Telphy.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.780
And only you.

20:12.860 --> 20:15.020
Now, I hear that

20:15.030 --> 20:18.100
you're already in some
kind of "relationship,"

20:18.140 --> 20:20.460
but when I heard that you were coming

20:20.470 --> 20:21.970
to our school,

20:22.020 --> 20:25.080
my school,

20:25.100 --> 20:30.150
I was smart enough to... intuit
what your arrival meant.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.280
A new day...

20:33.380 --> 20:35.610
a new dawn...

20:35.660 --> 20:37.060
for us.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.860
How was that?

20:39.920 --> 20:41.479
Are you serious?

20:41.480 --> 20:42.620
She left yesterday, man.

20:42.630 --> 20:43.980
What do you mean, "she left yesterday"?

20:44.040 --> 20:47.020
Thankfully, because... if
she heard that, oof...

20:47.130 --> 20:48.480
What are you doing with these?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.200
Sh-She went back with dude?
