WEBVTT

00:04.048 --> 00:06.751
This book that sits before me
is the physical manifestation

00:06.752 --> 00:08.585
of all your hard work.

00:08.587 --> 00:10.521
The fruits of your labor.

00:10.522 --> 00:13.057
The vessel in which
you've laid bare your soul,

00:13.058 --> 00:15.793
exposing it like
a freshly-waxed orifice.

00:15.794 --> 00:17.028
Oh! Let me see the orifice.

00:17.029 --> 00:20.064
I mean, the-the book.
God, the book, the book.

00:20.065 --> 00:21.432
(gasps) Oh.

00:21.433 --> 00:24.269
It's beautiful.
(laughs)

00:24.270 --> 00:27.004
Bring it to your bosom.

00:28.139 --> 00:30.041
Oh, my God, it's real.

00:30.042 --> 00:31.209
My own book.

00:31.210 --> 00:33.444
Oh, and look at me
in that brown sweater.

00:33.445 --> 00:35.279
You know, I fight it,

00:35.280 --> 00:37.682
but I really am an Autumn.

00:37.683 --> 00:39.951
I want you to enjoy
this moment...

00:39.952 --> 00:42.385
the crowning achievement
for every writer.

00:42.387 --> 00:44.822
I will. I-I've dreamt
of this day.

00:44.823 --> 00:46.958
Good. Now wake up!

00:46.959 --> 00:48.759
Hey!

00:48.760 --> 00:50.294
You're not a writer anymore.

00:50.295 --> 00:51.762
From now on, you're a salesman,

00:51.763 --> 00:54.932
a carnival barker, and that
book is your bearded lady,

00:54.933 --> 00:57.168
your dog-faced boy,
your conjoined twins.

00:57.169 --> 00:59.904
Okay, I get it!
I gotta sell the book!

00:59.905 --> 01:02.540
No, forget about the book.
You gotta sell yourself. Okay...

01:02.541 --> 01:04.474
Cut it out!

01:04.476 --> 01:07.978
You must brand yourself...
like Stephen King, J.K. Rowling,

01:07.979 --> 01:09.779
that <i>Chicken Soup
for the Soul</i> guy.

01:09.781 --> 01:13.784
Okay, I get it.
Just stop throwing it.

01:13.785 --> 01:16.253
We'll start
the media push with radio.

01:16.254 --> 01:18.789
Oh...

01:18.790 --> 01:20.224
radio.

01:20.225 --> 01:22.993
I just...
think that this might...

01:22.994 --> 01:25.596
want to be on TV.

01:25.597 --> 01:28.065
Well, that doesn't get on TV

01:28.066 --> 01:30.233
until this goes viral.

01:30.235 --> 01:32.803
Blogs, podcasts, social media...

01:32.804 --> 01:36.273
this needs to spread faster than
gonorrhea in a Dutch prison.

01:36.274 --> 01:37.975
(anxious laugh)

01:37.976 --> 01:40.944
Yikes... guess who's not
jaywalking in Amsterdam.

01:40.945 --> 01:42.880
(laughs)

01:42.881 --> 01:44.748
But what about
that launch party?

01:44.749 --> 01:46.316
You just tell me when and where

01:46.317 --> 01:48.519
and I'll throw on
something brown.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.354
I would love to have a grand
launch party for you. Oh!

01:51.356 --> 01:54.558
Unfortunately, the golden age
of publishing is long gone.

01:54.559 --> 01:56.326
How I miss the glamour,

01:56.327 --> 01:59.263
the money, the cocaine...

01:59.264 --> 02:01.331
Mostly the cocaine.

02:01.332 --> 02:03.300
You know, I snorted
Sweet'N Low once.

02:03.301 --> 02:06.836
It mostly just stung,
but I got into that sorority.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.440
That's not to say that we're
not gonna celebrate,

02:11.442 --> 02:13.944
it'll just be
a little less showy.

02:13.945 --> 02:15.645
Oh! (laughs)

02:15.646 --> 02:16.680
Book launch!

02:16.681 --> 02:18.315
Yeah! Oh, is that it?

02:18.316 --> 02:20.282
Unless you have some cocaine.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.524
This is exciting.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

02:54.525 --> 02:55.958
Oh...!
Oh, wait till you see it,

02:55.960 --> 02:57.727
the book turned out beautiful.

02:57.728 --> 02:59.428
Hey, you want me
to help there? No.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.398
I got it, I got it.
I just need to get this...

03:01.399 --> 03:02.631
this tape started.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.901
You want a knife?
Do you want to scratch the book?

03:04.902 --> 03:07.737
All right. Honey, you know what I did?
I did write a dedication page

03:07.738 --> 03:10.540
for you guys to thank you
for all your support.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.876
Well, why don't you open
the box and let us see?

03:12.877 --> 03:14.077
I am trying, okay?

03:14.078 --> 03:17.413
Do you not see me
trying to open it?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.750
Okay, if anybody here could
maybe give me scissors

03:20.751 --> 03:22.318
or a knife or something.

03:22.319 --> 03:24.387
Here.
Something to help.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.722
God, I gotta beg for it.

03:25.723 --> 03:27.524
Be careful, that's razor-sharp.

03:27.525 --> 03:29.359
Yeah. Ow! Son of a...
Oh!

03:29.360 --> 03:31.060
God.

03:31.061 --> 03:34.463
Oh, oh! Oh... oh...

03:38.868 --> 03:40.903
You're listening
to <i> The Morning Drive Time</i>

03:40.904 --> 03:43.172
with Big Stain and Willie.

03:43.173 --> 03:44.907
(car horn oogahs)

03:44.908 --> 03:47.744
It's ten minutes after the hour,
and we're back with Molly Flynn,

03:47.745 --> 03:51.514
talking about her sexy new book,
<i>Within Her Walls.</i>

03:51.515 --> 03:54.150
Ooh! Welcome, Molly.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.887
Thank you, Big Stain.
It's nice to be here.

03:57.888 --> 04:01.791
So, this book... I hear it's,
uh, one spicy read. (growls)

04:01.792 --> 04:04.393
Well... Well, it definitely
has its moments,

04:04.394 --> 04:06.295
but it's really a story
about a woman

04:06.296 --> 04:07.897
on a journey of self-discovery.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.098
(boinging sound effect)

04:09.099 --> 04:10.299
(laughs)

04:10.300 --> 04:11.901
I think Willie liked your book.

04:11.902 --> 04:14.203
(boinging)

04:14.204 --> 04:16.038
Well, thank you, Willie. Um...

04:16.039 --> 04:18.307
Hopefully, it will appeal
to a broad audience.

04:18.308 --> 04:20.576
You know, I... I tried to speak
to the human condition

04:20.577 --> 04:23.112
and not just have a series
of sex scenes in it, so...

04:23.113 --> 04:25.147
(boinging)

04:25.148 --> 04:27.817
Oh, okay, all right,
I get it, I get it.

04:27.818 --> 04:29.251
You're-You're gonna
make that sound

04:29.252 --> 04:32.121
every time I say anything
that has a sexual connotation.

04:32.122 --> 04:33.389
(boinging)

04:33.390 --> 04:35.023
There it is.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.661
Okay, anyhoo, uh, the point
that I was trying to make

04:38.662 --> 04:41.463
is that this book has a strong
female voice, which I think

04:41.464 --> 04:44.400
is really underrepresented
in modern literature, so I...

04:44.401 --> 04:46.235
(snoring)

04:46.236 --> 04:48.737
BIG STAIN: Wake up, Willie,
the lady's talking.

04:48.738 --> 04:51.106
(giggles)
It's funny. It's very funny.

04:51.107 --> 04:53.842
Um, listen, I understand
that this is your show,

04:53.843 --> 04:56.979
and that the wacky noises
are all part of the fun,

04:56.980 --> 04:58.480
but I worked my butt off...

04:58.481 --> 04:59.847
(farting)

04:59.849 --> 05:02.251
Aw, Willie!
(forced laugh)

05:02.252 --> 05:04.686
Make all the goofy noises
you want, I'm fine with it

05:04.687 --> 05:06.855
as long as I can still
promote my book, so...

05:06.856 --> 05:08.090
(buzzing)

05:08.091 --> 05:10.459
Oh, it looks like
we're plumb out of time.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.895
Well, wait a minute, we haven't
even promoted the book yet.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.063
Well, what'd you think
about it, Willie?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.265
(repeated boinging)

05:21.703 --> 05:23.171
"She knew in that moment,

05:23.172 --> 05:25.340
"not only did she find a lover,

05:25.341 --> 05:27.608
she also found herself."

05:32.147 --> 05:34.715
Any questions?

05:38.453 --> 05:39.720
Yes?

05:39.722 --> 05:42.991
I noticed your protagonist
is a very strong woman

05:42.992 --> 05:45.493
with her own thoughts
and opinions.

05:45.494 --> 05:47.229
Say she was here tonight...

05:47.230 --> 05:49.997
where do you think she'd like
to go to dinner after this?

05:52.734 --> 05:55.336
I don't care, Vince... wherever
you guys want to go to eat.

05:55.338 --> 05:57.604
Thank you for your response.

05:59.975 --> 06:02.277
Yeah, I got a question...
for everybody.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.713
How cute is she, huh?
Come on!

06:06.948 --> 06:08.549
Yes,

06:08.551 --> 06:11.152
to the man
who I don't live with?

06:11.153 --> 06:13.488
It's more of a follow-up
on that other question.

06:13.489 --> 06:15.924
If you like Mediterranean,
there's a new Greek place

06:15.925 --> 06:18.659
two blocks over... it's right
next to that rub and tug.

06:18.661 --> 06:21.029
Thanks, but I was just trying
to get the ball rolling

06:21.030 --> 06:22.297
'cause she was dying up there.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.665
We're having Italian.
Hey...

06:23.666 --> 06:26.167
Hey, Molly's the author.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.069
This is her day.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.103
We like tapas, don't we, honey?

06:30.105 --> 06:33.107
What I would like is a room
full of enthusiastic readers

06:33.108 --> 06:35.743
asking questions
about my book, but...

06:35.744 --> 06:38.612
I'll settle for...
yeah, tapas.

06:40.181 --> 06:41.882
Any other questions?

06:43.251 --> 06:45.552
That aren't about
where we're going to eat?

06:47.822 --> 06:50.558
Well, you've been
a fantastic audience.

06:50.559 --> 06:54.094
Let's keep this awkwardness
going over at the signing table.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.265
Get over there
and get a book signed.

06:58.266 --> 07:00.368
She looks ridiculous,
sitting there all by herself.

07:00.369 --> 07:01.836
I don't want to buy another one.

07:01.837 --> 07:05.005
If she writes in it,
I can't return it.

07:05.006 --> 07:06.707
I can hear you.

07:06.708 --> 07:09.809
Okay? I'm humiliated,
I'm not deaf.

07:12.446 --> 07:13.714
Hi.

07:13.715 --> 07:15.849
Who would you like me
to make this out to?

07:15.851 --> 07:19.085
I am the one who
leads the lambs to slaughter.

07:21.255 --> 07:24.191
How about best wishes?

07:24.192 --> 07:25.892
(chuckles)

07:30.397 --> 07:32.299
Finally finished reading
your wife's book.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.901
It's very well-written.

07:33.902 --> 07:35.602
I'll tell her you said that.

07:35.603 --> 07:39.005
Yeah, and don't tell her I said
this: it's a bit of a turn-on.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.679
Yeah, I kind of don't
want to hear that, either.

07:46.681 --> 07:49.516
Can I tell you
a little secret? No.

07:49.517 --> 07:51.018
It's the first time I've
taken care of business

07:51.019 --> 07:52.252
without visual aids.

07:52.253 --> 07:54.621
Aah!

07:54.622 --> 07:56.490
I get it.

07:56.491 --> 07:58.392
So how's it going
with the sales?

07:58.393 --> 07:59.860
Oh, not so good.

07:59.861 --> 08:01.827
Molly's busting her ass
but no one's buying.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.030
You know what she needs...
an endorsement.

08:04.032 --> 08:06.465
Some celebrity blabbing about
how much they like the book.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.869
Yo, that's a good idea.
You know, you think about it,

08:08.870 --> 08:10.704
she's a Chicago schoolteacher,
she writes a book,

08:10.705 --> 08:13.472
there's only one Chicago
celebrity to promote it.

08:13.474 --> 08:17.042
ALL: Oprah...

08:18.178 --> 08:20.346
That's brilliant.
But how-how do we get it to her?

08:20.348 --> 08:21.882
Now, I-I been saving
this favor, but...

08:21.883 --> 08:24.551
my cousin plays tennis with the
dog groomer who leases his truck

08:24.552 --> 08:26.552
from Stedman's
estranged brother.

08:27.587 --> 08:30.590
You never told me
you knew Oprah.

08:30.591 --> 08:32.592
Oh, boy, this could be big.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.227
I mean, Oprah reads that book

08:34.227 --> 08:35.828
and tells people
to buy it, bingo-bango,

08:35.830 --> 08:37.763
we got a best-seller.
Exactly. The only thing we

08:37.765 --> 08:40.299
got to do next is figure out
who-who stars in the movie.

08:40.301 --> 08:41.900
Well, I don't want
to get ahead of ourselves,

08:41.902 --> 08:43.535
but my old roommate
Ndugo is friends

08:43.537 --> 08:45.004
with the karate instructor
of the kid

08:45.005 --> 08:48.441
whose father washes
Laura Linney's Prius.

08:48.442 --> 08:50.143
Oh, she's a wonderful actr...

08:50.144 --> 08:53.145
Well, wait, ah...
do you see her in the part?

08:53.147 --> 08:55.748
Honestly, I see her
more as the sister.

08:55.749 --> 08:58.618
I think, for the lead,
the name we're all looking for

08:58.619 --> 09:00.085
is Emma Stone.

09:00.087 --> 09:01.354
Ah!
Oh!

09:01.355 --> 09:04.157
Gentlemen,
I think we have a movie. Yes.

09:04.158 --> 09:06.259
Huh?

09:06.260 --> 09:08.995
(with stuffy nose):
My novel's really an exploration

09:08.996 --> 09:11.531
of one woman's sexual awakening.

09:11.532 --> 09:13.933
(blows nose)

09:13.934 --> 09:15.601
It's a love story,

09:15.602 --> 09:17.136
you know, plain and simple.

09:17.137 --> 09:20.540
I just developed my themes
through erotic...

09:20.541 --> 09:23.409
(coughing)

09:23.410 --> 09:25.511
...erotic imagery.

09:25.512 --> 09:27.580
Uh,<i> Within Her Walls.</i>

09:27.581 --> 09:29.749
Available in stores and online.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.684
I got... I got a big box here.

09:31.685 --> 09:33.386
If you just call me up...
(chuckles)

09:33.387 --> 09:35.388
I'll bring one over
to your house.

09:35.389 --> 09:38.024
Just buy the damn thing.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.126
Well, thanks for having me.

09:40.127 --> 09:42.294
I'm sorry I swore.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.965
Got some exciting news.

09:45.966 --> 09:50.102
Stedman's brother's dog groomer?
Gonna read your book.

09:50.103 --> 09:52.304
Yay.

09:52.305 --> 09:54.673
What is going on with you?

09:54.674 --> 09:57.042
My book didn't go viral,
but I think I did.

09:57.043 --> 09:58.309
Aw...

09:59.111 --> 10:00.246
Aw, honey, you are burning up.

10:00.247 --> 10:02.481
You gotta get to bed.
No, I can't.

10:02.482 --> 10:03.883
I got another radio interview

10:03.884 --> 10:05.918
and then I've got a reading
at the retirement home...

10:05.919 --> 10:07.586
You can't be near the elderly.
Whatever you got

10:07.587 --> 10:11.256
will take those old people out
like a set of spiral stairs.

10:11.257 --> 10:14.026
What am I supposed to do?

10:14.027 --> 10:15.961
You're supposed to get upstairs,

10:15.962 --> 10:17.996
climb under the covers,

10:17.997 --> 10:19.898
and I will bring you
some nice tea and honey.

10:19.899 --> 10:21.967
No, I gotta promote my book.
You have been

10:21.968 --> 10:23.935
doing that for weeks.
It's time to rest.

10:23.937 --> 10:25.938
It would be nice to rest.
Yes.

10:25.939 --> 10:28.906
Okay. I'll be right up
with your tea.

10:28.908 --> 10:31.777
You still love me, even though
I'm a failed author?

10:31.778 --> 10:32.978
Of course.

10:32.979 --> 10:34.880
(crying):
You think I'm a failed author?

10:34.881 --> 10:36.014
No, no! Of course I don't!

10:36.015 --> 10:39.418
Please go to bed. Please.

10:39.419 --> 10:41.585
(phone ringing)

10:47.693 --> 10:49.995
Molly Flynn's phone.

10:49.996 --> 10:53.064
Uh, no, she can't do
an interview right now.

10:53.065 --> 10:55.199
I'm her husband.

10:56.001 --> 10:59.337
Sure. Why no

10:59.338 --> 11:02.007
Okay.

11:02.008 --> 11:05.910
"Chapter Twelve: The Hayride.

11:05.912 --> 11:08.880
"The crow of the cock awoke me
from my slumber.

11:08.881 --> 11:11.283
"I could still taste the salt
of Sebastian

11:11.284 --> 11:13.218
on my hungry lips."

11:13.219 --> 11:16.217
Huh?

11:22.289 --> 11:24.724
(man speaking Spanish
over radio)

11:24.726 --> 11:27.795
(man continues speaking Spanish)

11:27.796 --> 11:30.331
...Molly Flynn...
(speaking Spanish)

11:30.332 --> 11:33.434
<i>...Within Her Walls.
Hola, Molly!</i>

11:33.435 --> 11:35.336
<i>Hola,</i> Manny.

11:35.337 --> 11:36.670
<i>Me llamo Molly Flynn.</i>

11:36.671 --> 11:38.539
<i>Gracias por la invitación.</i>

11:38.540 --> 11:41.975
<i>Mi libro represente un viaje
de</i> sexual awakening.

11:41.976 --> 11:43.510
(boing sound effect)

11:43.511 --> 11:46.213
<i>Adiós.</i>

11:46.214 --> 11:48.281
What are you doing?

11:48.283 --> 11:49.917
Failing in two languages.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.118
Why are you here?
I came over

11:52.120 --> 11:53.954
to cheer you up.
And I heard you were sick

11:53.955 --> 11:56.256
so I brought you some
of my five-garlic soup.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.124
Ugh. I'm not eating that.
Do you want me

11:58.126 --> 11:59.826
to rub it on your chest?
(groans)

11:59.827 --> 12:01.994
All right.

12:04.464 --> 12:06.400
(gags)

12:06.401 --> 12:08.468
Oh, that is potent.

12:08.469 --> 12:10.003
Oh. Whew.

12:10.004 --> 12:12.906
It's really opening up
the old nasal passages. Mmm.

12:12.907 --> 12:15.776
Give it time. It'll open
up all your passages.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.578
Wore yourself out pushing
that book, didn't you?

12:18.579 --> 12:20.847
I tried my best,
but no one's buying it.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.315
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

12:22.316 --> 12:24.184
What do you mean
what are you gonna do?

12:24.185 --> 12:26.186
You're gonna start
writing again!

12:26.187 --> 12:28.288
I don't know. It's too hard.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.856
You don't know hard.

12:29.857 --> 12:31.658
I remember
when I was a little girl,

12:31.659 --> 12:33.259
working on my daddy's farm.

12:33.261 --> 12:34.694
(quietly):
Oh, please don't tell me a story.

12:34.695 --> 12:36.062
Let me tell you a story.

12:36.063 --> 12:37.963
I was a meek

12:37.965 --> 12:40.033
little thing,
scared of my own shadow

12:40.034 --> 12:42.669
and the sheep I had to castrate.

12:42.670 --> 12:46.205
That's where you learned it?

12:46.207 --> 12:48.742
I had to pump my own water,
make my own clothes,

12:48.743 --> 12:51.910
and if the crop didn't get in,
well, we all went hungry.

12:51.912 --> 12:54.247
That's why I wanted
Mikey to be heavyset...

12:54.248 --> 12:57.317
so he could make it
through a tough winter.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.386
Okay, I get it, Peggy.
You had it harder than me.

13:00.387 --> 13:02.122
No, that's not the point
I'm trying to make.

13:02.123 --> 13:05.258
The point is, I didn't give up.

13:05.259 --> 13:08.261
Just when I thought my life
couldn't possibly get any worse,

13:08.262 --> 13:10.697
a city fella in a '56 Rambler

13:10.698 --> 13:14.233
pulled up to the house
and asked for directions.

13:14.234 --> 13:15.767
Was that Mike's dad?

13:15.769 --> 13:16.769
Hell, no.

13:16.770 --> 13:18.604
This was a real man.

13:18.605 --> 13:21.407
Wore a three-piece suit
with hard shoes

13:21.408 --> 13:26.012
and smelled like a pine forest
after a spring rain.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.880
That's very poetic, Peggy.

13:27.881 --> 13:29.448
What he did to me wasn't poetic.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.683
It was filthy.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.618
And I loved it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.922
Got to write it down. Go.

13:36.924 --> 13:40.126
I got in his car,
and we just drove for days,

13:40.127 --> 13:43.663
his hand on the wheel,
my head in his lap.

13:43.664 --> 13:47.266
I do love a bench seat.

13:47.267 --> 13:50.269
For the next three months
we wandered the countryside.

13:50.270 --> 13:54.406
Truth be told, he put more miles
on me than he did that Rambler.

14:00.646 --> 14:02.281
(door opens)

14:02.282 --> 14:03.516
MIKE: Hey.

14:03.517 --> 14:04.783
Look who's feeling better.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.284
Hey.

14:06.286 --> 14:08.587
Whew, what is that smell?

14:08.588 --> 14:10.356
Your mother's five-garlic soup.

14:10.357 --> 14:15.493
Oh, I hope you drank it,
'cause sh-she'll rub it on you.

14:15.495 --> 14:18.429
I went the oral route.

14:18.431 --> 14:20.165
Look at you, writing again.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.034
Yeah, a new story about
a young girl coming of age

14:23.036 --> 14:26.738
on a hardscrabble farm at the
base of the Mudlick Mountains.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.006
Mudlick? Th-That's weird.

14:28.007 --> 14:31.008
My mom grew up on a farm
in Mudlick.

14:33.512 --> 14:35.814
Aw, no!

14:35.815 --> 14:38.317
Mike, her story is incredible.

14:38.318 --> 14:40.118
Do you know she ran
away from home

14:40.119 --> 14:42.120
at 16, with a city feller,

14:42.121 --> 14:44.556
and went on a
cross-country crime spree?

14:44.557 --> 14:46.658
(chuckles)

14:46.659 --> 14:50.227
Wait, what?!
Yeah. Yeah.

14:50.229 --> 14:52.030
Yeah, I mean, it was... it was
petty crime... shoplifting,

14:52.031 --> 14:54.633
siphoning gas, not paying for
haircuts, that sort of thing,

14:54.634 --> 14:56.168
but...
(chuckles)

14:56.169 --> 14:59.471
<i>My</i> mother?
Yeah.

14:59.472 --> 15:01.807
They were hiding in
abandoned buildings and barns

15:01.808 --> 15:03.441
with your grandfather
hot on their trail.

15:03.442 --> 15:06.210
Believe me, their trail
was "H-O-T" hot.

15:06.212 --> 15:09.314
I don't think
I want to know what that means.

15:09.315 --> 15:12.683
Well, then you better
not read our book.

15:12.685 --> 15:14.618
"Our"?

15:14.620 --> 15:17.054
Yeah, she's writing it with me.

15:17.056 --> 15:19.658
Wha...

15:19.659 --> 15:22.026
Mike, your mother
has a great story,

15:22.028 --> 15:24.094
and I want to be the one to help
her tell it. So you're gonna

15:24.096 --> 15:25.196
spend the next six months

15:25.197 --> 15:27.064
working side-by-side
with my mother?

15:27.066 --> 15:28.600
Oh, it's gonna take
at least a year,

15:28.601 --> 15:30.335
and more than a few
trips to Mudlick.

15:30.336 --> 15:35.306
I want to put my hands in the
dirt that sprouted Peggy Biggs.

15:35.307 --> 15:40.144
Okay, well...
good luck with that.

15:40.145 --> 15:44.749
Just a heads up, I-I think
the farm's a Walmart now.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.150
That's fine.

15:46.151 --> 15:49.686
I'll just go to the Garden
Center and grab a bag of mulch.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:01.979 --> 16:04.146
Here we are, ladies.
Okay.

16:04.148 --> 16:07.317
Can I get you two anything
to drink?

16:07.318 --> 16:10.087
I'd take a Sanka, if you got it.

16:10.088 --> 16:12.788
I don't know what that is.

16:12.790 --> 16:15.357
Just get her something hot
and bitter.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.994
You said you were trying

16:17.995 --> 16:19.396
to picture me as a young girl?

16:19.397 --> 16:22.299
There I go.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.234
Ladies.
MOLLY: Oh!

16:24.235 --> 16:26.102
Xander, I would like
to introduce you

16:26.103 --> 16:28.404
mmother-in-law, Ms. Peggy Biggs.

16:28.406 --> 16:32.475
So, this is what became of the
lost little girl from Mudlick.

16:32.476 --> 16:33.977
Yep, I...
Shh!

16:33.978 --> 16:36.880
Let me drink in that face.

16:36.881 --> 16:39.482
The permanently-etched scowl,

16:39.483 --> 16:41.351
the deep lines of disapproval

16:41.352 --> 16:44.087
in the forehead,
the eyes that once loved

16:44.088 --> 16:47.223
but are now filled
with silent judgment.

16:47.224 --> 16:49.124
Listen, princess...

16:49.926 --> 16:51.194
...I might have a few lines,

16:51.195 --> 16:53.396
but I canola oil this face
every night.

16:53.397 --> 16:56.498
It's as soft
as a catcher's mitt.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.802
She's magnificent!

16:59.803 --> 17:02.037
Right? I mean...

17:02.039 --> 17:04.773
can you imagine the story that
turned that sweet little girl

17:04.775 --> 17:06.776
into this?

17:06.777 --> 17:08.211
(Xander clears throat)

17:08.212 --> 17:11.614
I have to admit, I am rather
intrigued by the story.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.182
Oh, I'm so glad, but...

17:13.183 --> 17:16.252
just so you know,
so is Simon & Schuster.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.488
What?
Y-You went to them first?

17:18.489 --> 17:21.924
After the book launch
I gave you?!

17:21.925 --> 17:25.461
Well, I mean, we really want
to work with you, but...

17:25.462 --> 17:28.064
you're gonna have to be
willing to work with us.

17:28.065 --> 17:32.400
Show us the money, twinkle toes.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.808
(quietly): This is negotiating.
Just play it cool.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.408
(quietly): Gotcha.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.782
(both gasp, squeal, laugh)

17:48.718 --> 17:51.252
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

17:52.054 --> 17:55.169
Is this your final offer?

17:55.170 --> 17:59.380
It wasn't, but it is now.

17:59.381 --> 18:02.291
Oh, and we were lying about.
