WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:06.832
- Hi, there.
It's me, Ryan Eggold.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.270
I play Dr. Max Goodwin
on "New Amsterdam."

00:09.313 --> 00:11.489
We are very proud to bring you
our season two finale.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.100
It's a good one.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.492
But first, I want to take
a moment

00:14.536 --> 00:16.494
to thank all the healthcare
professionals

00:16.538 --> 00:19.323
who right now are working
their buns off

00:19.367 --> 00:21.238
to keep everyone safe.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.198
You guys are our inspiration
for every story

00:24.241 --> 00:25.373
we tell every episode we make,

00:25.416 --> 00:27.070
and now you are everyone's
inspiration,

00:27.114 --> 00:30.465
so thank you, and keep up
the heroic work

00:30.508 --> 00:31.596
that you are doing.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.511
We all dearly appreciate it.

00:33.555 --> 00:37.298
It's because of that admiration
and a sense of caution

00:37.341 --> 00:40.344
that we decided not to air
tonight's

00:40.388 --> 00:42.172
originally scheduled episode,

00:42.216 --> 00:44.479
which was titled "Pandemic."

00:44.522 --> 00:46.133
It hit a little too close
to home,

00:46.176 --> 00:48.091
and we didn't want to make
entertainment

00:48.135 --> 00:49.527
out of a story that's
a little too scary,

00:49.571 --> 00:52.182
a little too real
at the moment.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.401
But we're gonna show you
that episode later

00:53.444 --> 00:54.576
once some time has passed.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.360
But the good news is

00:56.404 --> 00:58.101
that we're gonna show you
a little teaser

00:58.145 --> 01:00.190
from that episode

01:00.234 --> 01:02.845
because it introduces

01:02.888 --> 01:04.412
one of our newest characters

01:04.455 --> 01:06.414
played by the incomparable

01:06.457 --> 01:08.851
Mr. Daniel Dae Kim,

01:08.894 --> 01:12.202
who I would like to hand it to
right now.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.421
- Thanks, Ryan.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.379
And aloha, everybody.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.903
Ryan is absolutely right.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.296
The storyline you're about
to see

01:19.340 --> 01:22.125
introduces my character,
Dr. Cassian Shin.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.561
Now what we've done is pulled
together

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
all of Cassian's scenes

01:25.172 --> 01:26.477
to give you a sense of his
character

01:26.521 --> 01:28.218
and how he's gonna change
more than a few things

01:28.262 --> 01:29.567
around the hospital.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.874
As you guys may know,
this storyline

01:31.917 --> 01:33.441
turned out to be very personal
to me

01:33.484 --> 01:36.618
because I ended up contracted
COVID-19,

01:36.661 --> 01:38.228
the disease caused by
coronavirus,

01:38.272 --> 01:41.275
while I was in New York
shooting this very episode.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.928
Now, thankfully, I was
fortunate enough

01:42.972 --> 01:45.627
to have experienced
a full recovery.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.585
But too many others have not.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.674
So on behalf of the entire
casting crew,

01:49.718 --> 01:52.329
we'd like to dedicate
this season finale

01:52.373 --> 01:54.462
to those still fighting
the illness.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.290
We're rooting for you.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.901
- How can I help?

01:58.944 --> 02:00.337
- We're down two
trauma surgeons.

02:00.381 --> 02:03.166
I had to call in our new hire
a week early.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
- You sure that they're
ready for this?

02:05.647 --> 02:07.301
- No.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.216
That's why I need you
to help him through it.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.179
- Dr. Shim?
- Hang on.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.964
Yes.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.184
- Hi, I'm Dr. Helen Sharpe,
Deputy Medical Director.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.533
We really appreciate you
starting early.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.492
- Yeah, Max said almost
half your staff was down.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.320
- And our patient load
has almost tripled.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.930
- Any recent traumas?
- Thankfully, no.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.627
But I need to get you
to the ED straightaway.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.238
- Which way is the men's
locker room?

02:31.281 --> 02:32.282
- Uh, it's back that way.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.979
There's a bathroom
just along here.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.504
- I need a hot shower.
- And we do need you in ED.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.680
- Yeah, but I need
that shower more.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.212
The hospital's in the middle
of a crisis.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.649
- I know--the dispenser
was out of body wash.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.216
- This is your new pager.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
As you can see,
it's being paged,

02:54.696 --> 02:56.393
so maybe it's time to wrap up
this beauty routine

02:56.437 --> 02:58.482
and join me in the ED.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.310
- How about I put on
some pants first?

03:03.444 --> 03:04.793
- This is Casey,
our head nurse.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.534
Casey, this is Dr. Shin,
our new trauma surgeon.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.275
- Oh, thank God.
Follow me.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.406
I got a kid who appears
to have swallowed

03:09.450 --> 03:10.842
some rare earth magnets.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.541
- Ah, that's a surefire way
to get attention, huh?

03:13.584 --> 03:15.412
Hi, I'm Dr. Shin.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.589
Casey, do you know the risks

03:18.633 --> 03:20.374
when adjusting multiple
magnets?

03:20.417 --> 03:23.290
- Uh, if the magnets
were to connect internally,

03:23.333 --> 03:24.682
they could twist
the intestines,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.249
force hemorrhages,

03:26.293 --> 03:27.729
intussusception.

03:27.772 --> 03:31.341
- Even a strangulated bowel.
- They can also do this.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.518
Cool, right?

03:34.562 --> 03:36.694
But you only swallowed
one magnet, didn't you?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.000
- Mm.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.350
- So that should pass
in a few hours.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
Turns out you don't need me.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.267
- Uh, in case you haven't
noticed,

03:44.311 --> 03:46.617
we have a full ED of patients
who need your help.

03:46.661 --> 03:47.705
Where do you think
you're going?

03:47.749 --> 03:49.316
- I always show up
when I'm paged,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.753
but I only stay
when I'm needed.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.326
- Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.805
Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.504
- Should I go
for the energy drink

04:03.547 --> 04:04.722
or the protein bar?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.463
- Why would you need energy?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.378
You seem intent on doing
virtually nothing.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.599
- So you vote protein bar.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.078
- I know that trauma surgeons

04:13.122 --> 04:15.080
like to play the aloof
cowboy, but that's not--

04:15.124 --> 04:16.604
- That's not how
you do things here.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.432
- No, yes, it's not.
- I know.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.607
Don't you think I researched
this place

04:19.650 --> 04:20.825
before I took the job?

04:20.869 --> 04:23.088
- Then you should also know
Max's motto.

04:23.132 --> 04:26.353
- "How can I help?"
Yeah, that's catchy.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.703
- It's words that we live by.
Everybody chips in.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.271
Everybody helps.
- Right now I am helping.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.362
By eating a protein bar.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.103
Hm. Duty calls.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.453
Well, maybe.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.634
So what you got?

04:46.677 --> 04:48.636
- Lucas Jarvis.
Nail gun mishap.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.333
- It slipped.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.769
- Well, Mr. Jarvis,
you're very lucky.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.336
- This is lucky?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.772
- Well, the fact that your new
nail appendage

04:54.816 --> 04:56.644
missed the bone in every one
of your fingers is.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.559
You know what?

04:58.602 --> 05:00.125
- Don't you dare.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.736
- I'm thinking Dr...
- Turan.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.085
- Dr. Turan here gets
to practice

05:03.128 --> 05:04.129
her nail extraction skills.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.653
- Now, a little numbing agent

05:05.696 --> 05:07.350
and some gentle retrograde
pressure,

05:07.394 --> 05:08.438
and that sucker should
come right out.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.744
- Dr. Shin--
- You got this?

05:09.787 --> 05:11.354
- Yeah.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.790
- Dr. Shin!
- Mm?

05:12.834 --> 05:14.139
- Where are you going?

05:14.183 --> 05:15.837
- Nap time.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.538
I don't want to hear it.
My friend is sick,

05:21.582 --> 05:22.757
another is gone,
this hospital is slammed,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.541
and I'm gonna need you
to be a team player

05:24.585 --> 05:25.716
for once,
do you understand?

05:25.760 --> 05:26.848
- I'm always a team player.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.458
Kit Brower, 25.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.677
Multiple lacs
from a large explosion

05:29.720 --> 05:30.765
at his home.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.680
- What exploded?
What's that smell?

05:32.723 --> 05:34.116
- I make beer.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.857
My fermenting vat--

05:35.900 --> 05:37.511
- Book an OR right now.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.123
Grab a side.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.430
Nurse, I need two units
of O-neg on a bear-hugger.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.432
- Hold on, the entire wing
is contaminated.

05:45.475 --> 05:48.478
No more surgeries until we can
disinfect every OR.

05:48.522 --> 05:49.784
Hey, welcome to New Amsterdam.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.134
- Oh, yeah.
Great place.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.744
But look, he needs surgery
right now.

05:53.788 --> 05:57.487
How about an ICU?
- Attendant's in quarantine.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.489
- I got a place in mind.
We got to turn around.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.534
Thanks.

06:05.843 --> 06:06.931
- You guys need something here?

06:06.975 --> 06:08.455
- Yeah, we're commandeering
your rig.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.804
Help me get him in.
- Wait, where are we going?

06:09.847 --> 06:11.458
- Nowhere--we're doing
the surgery right here.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.503
Grab an OR tray and any
supplies you need.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.203
You in?

06:28.257 --> 06:29.476
This is trouble.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.868
When the glass tank exploded,

06:30.912 --> 06:32.522
it blew apart
the housing cabinet,

06:32.566 --> 06:35.960
pieces of which are all over
Kip's abdomen.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.701
- If wood doesn't show up
on an X-ray.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.487
how are we gonna find
all the splinters?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.532
- BP's dropping.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.534
- Turn off all the lights
and cover all the windows.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.451
Now, flip that switch
to your right.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.674
Certain types of hardwood
turn fluorescent in blacklight.

06:53.717 --> 06:54.805
This ambulance has a UV light

06:54.849 --> 06:56.503
to keep infection
under control.

06:56.546 --> 06:57.721
Are you just gonna sit there?

06:57.765 --> 07:00.768
Everybody chips in,
everybody helps, right?

07:04.032 --> 07:06.730
Ready to drive now?

07:08.558 --> 07:09.864
- You know, when I saw
the shards of wood,

07:09.907 --> 07:11.692
I honestly didn't think
he was gonna make it.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.565
- What are you saying?

07:15.609 --> 07:16.958
- I'm saying...

07:19.526 --> 07:21.223
Just what I said.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.833
- Oh, okay.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.488
'Cause, you know, that kinda
sounded like a compliment.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.273
- Would you like a gold star
on your report card?

07:28.317 --> 07:29.927
-  No.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.276
But if you're gonna
compliment me,

07:31.320 --> 07:32.800
it should sound
like a compliment.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.845
- It was implied.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.239
Despite the fact that you took
a job in a public hospital

07:37.282 --> 07:38.675
and then refused to help.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.549
I didn't take the job
to help out everyone.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.987
I took the job
to save trauma victims.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.250
If a patient who needs
a trauma surgeon rolls up,

07:48.293 --> 07:50.557
I need to be
at the top of my game.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.559
And that may require
a shower or a nap

07:52.602 --> 07:54.517
or a protein bar,

07:54.561 --> 07:56.824
but whatever it takes,
I'm gonna do it,

07:56.867 --> 07:59.043
because I need to be ready.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.742
Self-care saves lives.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.702
Might not be the New Amsterdam
way, but...

08:05.746 --> 08:06.877
it's my way.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.490
What?

08:12.622 --> 08:15.930
- Nothing, um...

08:15.973 --> 08:18.802
that makes perfect sense.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.717
- But?

08:20.761 --> 08:24.721
- But I save lives
every day too.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.070
And without naps.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.314
- It was totally packed.
I mean, every seat was taken,

08:52.357 --> 08:54.751
but I desperately wanted
the aisle.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.710
- So I swapped with her

08:56.753 --> 08:58.755
and endured the horrific middle
seat like a proper gentleman.

08:58.799 --> 09:02.019
- And the rest as they say
is history.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.067
So how 'bout you?
How'd you two meet?

09:08.809 --> 09:11.942
- Uh, that is a very
funny story actually,

09:11.986 --> 09:15.076
because I work for the, uh,
Yankees.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.862
- Don't be modest, babe.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.995
He's the general manager.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.911
And I, believe it or not--
I worked for the Mets.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.042
- The Mets.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.087
And she's
their general manager.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.871
- Wait.
Seriously?

09:27.915 --> 09:28.916
- Yeah, I know.
It's kind of hard to believe,

09:28.959 --> 09:30.657
but it's--
- We met at

09:30.700 --> 09:32.049
a General Managers Convention.
- That's--yeah--

09:32.093 --> 09:33.355
- Wait, I didn't even know
those were a thing.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.791
- Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.

09:34.835 --> 09:35.923
We don't call it inside
baseball for nothing.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.664
-  You're funny.
- Dad! Mom!

09:37.707 --> 09:39.056
Come look at this!

09:39.100 --> 09:41.058
- Coming, honey.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.843
- It was so nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.410
- You guys are like
the perfect family.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.891
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.153
- See ya.
- Bye.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.116
- Hey.
What are you doing?

09:55.159 --> 09:56.421
Mmm.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.917
- Oh.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.703
Hey, buddy.
You okay?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.444
Hey, buddy.
Wanna get up?

10:19.488 --> 10:20.924
Oh, you got it?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.450
- Liam.
- Hi.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.887
- I'm--I'm so sorry about that.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.410
- How'd you get so far
ahead of me, buddy?

10:28.453 --> 10:29.977
- No, no.
That's okay.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.761
Um, I don't mean to pry,

10:31.805 --> 10:33.415
but does your son often
have difficulty standing?

10:33.458 --> 10:34.416
- Uh...
- He's always been

10:34.459 --> 10:36.200
a bit clumsy, but...

10:36.244 --> 10:38.246
Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Yeah, why?

10:39.769 --> 10:42.424
- Only asking
because I'm a doctor.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.078
Do you have a pediatrician?

10:44.121 --> 10:46.080
- Not at the moment.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.777
- Um, um, we just moved here,

10:47.821 --> 10:49.910
and with everything we're--
we're still--

10:49.953 --> 10:52.129
- Does...
- Liam.

10:52.173 --> 10:55.959
- Liam, does he have, um,
difficulty going upstairs,

10:56.003 --> 10:58.875
or does he get tired easily?

11:00.050 --> 11:02.879
- Why, is...

11:02.923 --> 11:04.489
Something wrong with him?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.883
- How about this?
Come to New Amsterdam with me,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.756
let me run a few tests
just to be sure.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.457
Lead the way.
- Okay.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.459
- Mm, come here, buddy.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.118
- Wha--
- Oh!

11:24.161 --> 11:25.902
- Mom.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.164
- Darling, you can't just go
barreling into people

11:27.208 --> 11:28.818
like that.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.472
You're gonna break my arm
or something.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.082
- Okay, okay, look, I love all
the time we've spent together,

11:32.126 --> 11:33.475
I do, but...
- Aw, me too, sweetheart.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.129
- You cannot just show up
here every--

11:35.172 --> 11:36.957
whenever you wanna
see me, okay?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.481
We need boundaries.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.745
- I know.
I agree, and I understand.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.269
But I'm not here to see you.
- Hmm?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.057
- I hope you have
a fabulous day.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.276
- Okay.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.196
- Casey, hi.
Shh.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.025
- Okay, okay.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.507
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.774
- Has my mother
been harassing you?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.558
- I don't know your mother.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.866
- I just saw you two
out in the hall.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.957
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
Uh, we just met.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.742
- You were hugging.

12:23.830 --> 12:24.961
- Were we?
- Yeah.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.920
- Incoming!

12:27.834 --> 12:30.793
Construction scaffolding
collapsed near 46th and Lex.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.534
There's five more
after this one.

12:32.577 --> 12:36.016
- Okay, let's, uh, get them
to Bay 23 and um, page Ortho.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.539
Okay, we got multiple burns.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
Let's start a line.
I'm'na be right back.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.891
There's so much blood.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.806
- Okay, you just need
some stitches, okay?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.199
Let's get her to Bay 29.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.897
Hang two liters normal saline
wide open.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.247
You see anything
that interests you today?

12:50.291 --> 12:53.120
- Mmm,
nope.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.862
- Always a pleasure, Dr. Shin.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.299
Kay, keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.910
- Do you know what this is?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.999
- If I say yes,
will you not tell me?

13:03.043 --> 13:04.827
- No,
it's the needlessly complicated

13:04.871 --> 13:06.263
and brain-numbingly
detailed application

13:06.307 --> 13:08.004
for the state hospital
accreditation review.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.614
- Hmm, don't you have
another year until that's due?

13:09.658 --> 13:11.268
- Yes, we do,

13:11.312 --> 13:13.140
but if I wait that long
it's never gonna get done,

13:13.183 --> 13:15.272
so if we just knock this out
today, it'll be off our plates.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.013
- I think--
I think you mean your plate.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.276
- Uh, our plate.
Like, shared plate.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.930
Like tapas, you know?
Two hours.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.105
Tops.
- Fine.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.846
- Great.
- See you after work.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.981
- Plasma exchange
is still considered

13:28.024 --> 13:30.853
to be one of the most effective
first-line therapies

13:30.897 --> 13:32.942
for autoimmune encephalitis.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.162
- They didn't have hazelnut,
honey.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.990
Of course they didn't.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.253
- Mmm.
- Your husband is all set.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.037
The process will take
several hours,

13:41.081 --> 13:43.170
but I will check on you
in a bit.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.911
- At least I brought a book.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.957
- Hang on.
Dr. Kapoor.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.180
What's going on with you?

13:53.223 --> 13:54.964
- What's going on?

13:55.008 --> 13:57.924
- You look different
from our last visit.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.186
Do I?

13:59.229 --> 14:00.230
- Don't be modest.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.406
- Well, I can't imagine...

14:02.450 --> 14:04.234
- Whatever you're doing...

14:05.714 --> 14:07.324
It's working for you.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
Mmm.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.943
- Congratulations,

14:16.986 --> 14:18.988
you are officially halfway
through your chemotherapy.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.077
- Does my ovarian cancer
know that?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.079
- How have you been doing
at home?

14:23.123 --> 14:25.386
- Humble.
Can't eat.

14:25.429 --> 14:29.085
Can't get outta bed.
Can't even shower by myself.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.132
If not for Oliver,
I don't know what I'd do.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.003
- "In sickness and in health."

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
- Guess you should've read
the fine print.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.447
What?
What is it?

14:43.491 --> 14:46.363
- Lena has necrotizing
fasciitis on her calf...

14:46.407 --> 14:48.104
- From the cancer?

14:48.148 --> 14:50.672
- No, it started as a small cut
that got infected.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.282
We need to get her
to the ED straight away.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.197
- I can't believe
I missed a cut.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.112
I guess I just never look
at the back of her legs.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.374
- It's okay.
These things happen.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.251
- Dr. Ignatius Frome

15:04.294 --> 15:07.341
is offered as administrator
to the appellant's

15:07.384 --> 15:09.996
ERPOmandated
psychological evaluation.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.301
Mr. Phillips, do you accept?

15:15.436 --> 15:17.307
- We do.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.961
- State of New York?

15:19.005 --> 15:21.268
- Good by us, Your Honor.
- So ordered.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.009
We'll reconvene once
Mr. Phillip's evaluation

15:23.052 --> 15:24.140
is complete.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.925
We're adjourned.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.716
- Brendan, hi.
Dr. Frome.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.718
- I can't believe
this is happening.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.285
- Well, why don't we take
a little walk up to my office,

15:38.328 --> 15:39.939
and we'll have a chat, okay?

15:41.766 --> 15:45.031
- How do the cops have any
right to take away my gun?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.728
I'm trained, and I'm licensed--

15:46.771 --> 15:49.035
- Well, yeah, the issue is not
if you're licensed.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.732
The Red Flag Law
was put in place

15:50.775 --> 15:52.255
to determine if you are an
immediate danger to yourself

15:52.299 --> 15:53.996
or to others.
That's it.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.263
- I can't believe Ellie
did this to me.

16:00.307 --> 16:03.266
- Yeah, divorce makes people
see the worst in each other,

16:03.310 --> 16:04.920
for sure,

16:04.964 --> 16:07.009
but that is why it's important
to have an impartial evaluator

16:07.053 --> 16:09.316
in the process.
You ready?

16:13.059 --> 16:15.409
Any idea why your wife
would say you're so dangerous?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.324
- Yeah.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.239
'Cause I almost killed her.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.469
- Your feet make good drums.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.212
- Hey.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.345
- Hey, we'll be right back.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.223
- We sequenced your son's genes

16:47.267 --> 16:51.010
and were able to determine the
cause of the mobility issues.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.362
- It's bad, isn't it?

16:57.581 --> 17:01.194
- Your son has
what's known as DMD,

17:01.237 --> 17:03.326
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.373
It is a rapidly progressive
degenerative disease

17:06.416 --> 17:09.550
that affects
around 1 in 5,000 boys.

17:09.593 --> 17:13.293
- But he's gonna be okay,
right?

17:17.558 --> 17:21.170
- There's no easy way
to say this.

17:21.214 --> 17:24.173
There is no cure right now.

17:24.217 --> 17:29.135
As he ages he will experience
continual muscle loss.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.529
He'll be confined
to a wheelchair by his teens.

17:32.573 --> 17:37.839
And by his twenties,
he will likely succumb to it.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.279
- I don't--

17:43.323 --> 17:46.282
how did he...

17:46.326 --> 17:48.589
- It's inherited.

17:48.632 --> 17:51.287
It's a mutation
of the dystrophin gene

17:51.331 --> 17:54.421
on the X chromosome passed down
from mother to son.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.215
- I did this?
- No.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.608
There's nothing
you could've done.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.353
- This can't be happening.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.356
My baby boy.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.228
Oh, my...

18:23.319 --> 18:25.582
- Thank you, Oliver.
- Anything to help.

18:25.626 --> 18:29.412
- Okay, you two
just hang tight.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.242
I need to perform
a debridement

18:33.286 --> 18:34.896
on Lena Luzan in Bay 28.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.290
- Local anesthesia or a top--
- Little help here!

18:39.683 --> 18:41.294
- What happened?
- No clue.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.643
His heart rate
just fell off a cliff.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.168
No warning.
- The same thing over here!

18:49.998 --> 18:52.566
- Bradycardia!
Need a crash cart, STAT!

18:52.609 --> 18:54.263
- Two more crashing over here!

18:59.616 --> 19:01.357
- What the hell is happening?

19:01.401 --> 19:04.404
- It's everyone who came in
from the scaffolding accident.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.803
- At least everyone is stable.
- What was that all about?

19:12.847 --> 19:15.893
- And he emerges
from the break room.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.417
To what do we owe this honor?

19:17.460 --> 19:20.159
We got a incoming trauma
actually worth your time?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.813
We'll see.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.728
Hey.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.034
- Hey.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.992
- Incoming!

19:28.036 --> 19:29.951
30-year-old male in MVA.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.780
1965 antique roadster
versus a concrete divider.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.911
- What is that?

19:33.955 --> 19:35.174
- What's left
of the steering column.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.872
- Now we're talking.
Right this way.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.184
- "Hey."

19:45.227 --> 19:47.969
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.843
- Maybe her hand just, like,
grazed your leg accidentally.

19:52.887 --> 19:56.020
- This woman definitely
cupped my buttocks.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.198
- That's a sentence
I hoped never to hear out loud.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.938
- Why is it so hard
for you to believe

20:00.982 --> 20:03.767
that this woman
is actually attracted to me?

20:03.811 --> 20:05.987
- Because at Walter's
last session,

20:06.030 --> 20:09.208
they kept going on and on about
renewing their wedding vows.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.254
- Yes.
I guess timing is suspect.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.038
- All I'm saying is,

20:14.082 --> 20:16.215
is it possible
this is all in your head?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.790
- Robin.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.923
- Uh, my husband's ready
for his next round.

20:28.966 --> 20:32.056
The question is, are you?

20:34.929 --> 20:36.931
- There's a dozen
active clinical trials

20:36.974 --> 20:38.759
studying potential treatments
for Duchennes.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.936
Our job will be finding one
that works for Liam.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.503
- Oh, we're not picky,
Dr. Goodwin.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.069
- I know, but they are.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.855
Each trial has a rigid set
of inclusion criteria

20:47.898 --> 20:51.902
and only accepts patients
that meet them all.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.948
They don't make it easy.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.298
I say we start
with the East Coast,

20:56.342 --> 20:58.300
and uh,
look at gene therapy trials.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.954
See what we can find.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.087
- I have to go
to the bathroom.

21:03.131 --> 21:06.874
- Okay, kiddo.
Can you walk it?

21:06.917 --> 21:09.006
Okay.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.052
I gotcha.
Up, up.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.016
- I was sound asleep.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.323
Around 1:00 a.m.,
I hear this noise.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.064
Someone's in the house.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.022
I grab my Glock,
and I head downstairs.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.285
- Was it loaded?

21:28.243 --> 21:30.027
- Someone was breaking in.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.203
- Where do you keep your gun?

21:32.247 --> 21:34.989
- I was protecting my home.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.034
Last time I checked,
it was my right.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.559
I don't have a record.
Not even a misdemeanor.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.125
- Okay, so,

21:41.169 --> 21:43.127
you were heading downstairs
with your loaded gun.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.608
What happens next?

21:45.652 --> 21:47.567
- I see someone in the dark.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.874
I raise my gun,
I tell them to hit the floor,

21:50.918 --> 21:52.136
and then I realize it's Ellie.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.834
- But you did aim your gun
at her.

21:55.923 --> 21:59.187
- I mean, yeah.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.321
But I lowered it the second
I knew it was her.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.061
- Ellie claims
that she was just there

22:04.105 --> 22:05.193
to pick up some of her stuff.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.847
Had she officially moved out?

22:08.109 --> 22:11.068
- No, she'd just been staying
at her sister's.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.376
- Brendan, how would you say
you're handling this divorce?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.596
- That has nothing to do
with anything.

22:16.639 --> 22:19.076
- Well, except it does because
I'm trying to get a better idea

22:19.120 --> 22:21.644
of your mental state--
- Do you own a gun?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.603
Do you own a gun?

22:23.646 --> 22:27.084
- That's not--
this is not about me.

22:27.128 --> 22:29.130
- Are you sure about that?

22:30.436 --> 22:32.046
Tell me.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.396
Are you in favor of open carry?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.093
What about
the Second Amendment?

22:36.137 --> 22:37.399
- Brendan--

22:37.443 --> 22:39.096
- I'm the one whose house
got broken into.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.925
I'm the one whose rights
are being stripped away,

22:41.969 --> 22:44.928
and you sit there,
and you claim to be impartial,

22:44.972 --> 22:46.974
but from over here,

22:47.017 --> 22:49.890
it sure as hell seems your just
another bleeding heart liberal

22:49.933 --> 22:53.894
who made up his mind the second
he heard the word "gun."

22:58.464 --> 23:00.640
- Well, that's very good news.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.990
Maybe we should cut it down
to twice a week.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.644
- Sorry to interrupt.
Dr. Cholokian?

23:04.687 --> 23:06.428
- Yeah, you found him.
- Great.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.429
- You know,
I was just reading up

23:07.473 --> 23:09.300
on your clinical collaboration

23:09.344 --> 23:11.390
with Children's
in Sacramento and I--

23:11.433 --> 23:13.087
- Let me stop you right there.
- Really?

23:13.130 --> 23:15.132
I haven't even gotten to
the glowing praise part yet.

23:15.176 --> 23:18.048
- You've heard about
my DMD clinical trial

23:18.092 --> 23:21.182
because you have a patient
you want to enroll.

23:21.225 --> 23:24.141
- Well, uh, guilty as charged.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.274
- Has your patient already
submitted a pre-application

23:26.317 --> 23:28.058
to the Biomedical Research
Application Portal?

23:28.102 --> 23:31.279
- My patient just got
the diagnosis this morning.

23:31.322 --> 23:34.021
- I'll take that as a no.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.415
- Uh...

23:36.458 --> 23:38.939
yeah, I was just thinking that,
uh--

23:38.982 --> 23:42.072
- What, you could
sweet-talk me?

23:42.116 --> 23:45.075
You don't think I want to help
as many children as I can?

23:45.119 --> 23:46.686
I do.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.949
But my trial has over two dozen
exclusion criteria

23:48.992 --> 23:50.298
for a reason.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.039
We have limited resources
to work with.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.041
- I know, I read your criteria.
Trust me.

23:54.084 --> 23:56.173
Liam Cafferty is a perfect fit.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.001
- There is no perfect fit.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.960
- Except for Liam.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.962
He's six and a half,
he loves building with blocks,

24:02.005 --> 24:03.311
and right now,

24:03.354 --> 24:05.705
he doesn't qualify for
any other gene therapy trial

24:05.748 --> 24:09.099
in the country, so
this could be his only shot...

24:09.143 --> 24:11.188
- You know why we only accept

24:11.232 --> 24:12.494
patients through
the online portal?

24:12.538 --> 24:15.192
So we can remove
the advantage of privilege.

24:15.236 --> 24:18.065
Like you cornering me in my lab

24:18.108 --> 24:20.720
to make a personal plea
for one patient.

24:20.763 --> 24:24.114
I'm sorry, Dr.--
- Goodwin.

24:24.158 --> 24:28.162
Medical director
at, uh, New Amsterdam,

24:28.205 --> 24:30.077
where you dump
a lot of your patients

24:30.120 --> 24:32.732
to keep
your infection rates low.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.169
So tell me again
about privilege.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.260
- Two conditions.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.741
First: I need a psyche eval of
the boy by the end of the day

24:41.784 --> 24:43.482
along with a completed
pre-application form.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.744
- Done.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.441
- Second: he'll need to pass

24:46.485 --> 24:47.486
his physical fitness
requirements.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.009
- Got it.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.358
Thank you.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.016
- Casey?

24:56.059 --> 24:57.539
- Zoll pads are working
for now.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.498
As if being crushed by falling
scaffolding wasn't enough.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.195
- Whatever they were
all exposed to,

25:01.238 --> 25:02.675
it's not messing around.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.459
- The sputum samples should
be back in a few hours.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.201
- Okay, well, uh, until then,
you, uh,

25:07.244 --> 25:09.769
care to tell me why
you and my mother were hugging?

25:09.812 --> 25:12.032
Lauren, I already told you...

25:12.075 --> 25:13.381
- Ooh, God, here we go.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.514
This is Jake Holstein
all over again...

25:15.557 --> 25:18.168
- I feel like you want me to
ask who Jake Holstein is.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.170
- No, I don't need you to ask.

25:20.214 --> 25:23.086
Jake Holstein
was this super cool senior

25:23.130 --> 25:25.132
who liked me
when I was a freshman.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.786
But every time he would try
to hang out with me,

25:26.829 --> 25:28.352
he would get dragged into these

25:28.396 --> 25:30.354
long, flirty conversations
with my mother,

25:30.398 --> 25:32.487
because Jeanie always has to be
the focus

25:32.531 --> 25:34.141
of every guy in the room.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.230
- I need a code team here!

25:36.273 --> 25:37.448
Lena.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.450
Lena!

25:41.409 --> 25:43.150
Her heart rate just crashed
out of nowhere.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.630
- Is she going to be okay?

25:44.673 --> 25:47.458
- We're working on it, sir.
Please give us some room.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.157
- Sudden drop in heart rate,
normal O2 saturation.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.593
Same symptoms as
the construction site.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.160
- But Lena came from me.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.379
She was never near
the accident.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.425
- So whatever's happening
to our patients,

25:57.468 --> 25:59.383
we're the ones
doing it to them.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.350
- Uh, you okay?
- What?

26:09.393 --> 26:11.613
Hi.
Um...

26:11.657 --> 26:14.050
I might be making premature
judgments from a place of bias.

26:14.094 --> 26:17.619
- That's great, because I need
you to blindly sign this.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.621
- Whatever happened to,
"how can I help"?

26:19.665 --> 26:20.883
- No, don't have time for that.
This is a psyche eval

26:20.927 --> 26:22.232
for a patient
you're never gonna meet.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.669
- Max, I'm--I'm actually
struggling with something

26:23.712 --> 26:24.931
really big right now,

26:24.974 --> 26:26.149
I don't think cutting corners
is the best--

26:26.193 --> 26:27.803
- His name is Liam Cafferty.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.936
He is a 6-year-old boy
with Duchennes.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.633
Right now he is struggling

26:31.677 --> 26:34.070
to get into the only
clinical trial in this country

26:34.114 --> 26:37.117
that could possibly
extend his life.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.079
You're the best, buddy.
- Um...

26:43.123 --> 26:44.820
Thanks.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.172
- Iggy, Iggy.
- Hi.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.000
- I need your advice.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.698
- No, actually, BJ, I'm going
through something big.

26:52.741 --> 26:53.829
I need you to maybe--

26:53.873 --> 26:55.004
- I am being
sexually propositioned

26:55.048 --> 26:56.963
by a patient's wife.

26:57.006 --> 27:00.793
- My God, everyone has
such good comebacks today.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.446
All right, okay, all right,
I'll bite.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.666
Are you sure
that she's hitting on you?

27:04.710 --> 27:06.189
- Why is it so difficult
for anyone to believe it?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.669
- Mm, mmm...

27:07.713 --> 27:09.018
- That woman rubbed
my shoulders,

27:09.062 --> 27:11.107
she whispered into my ear,
and she cupped my bottom.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.805
Please tell me what to do.
Please.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.110
- Oh, okay.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.938
Well, actually,
that does sound a lot

27:15.982 --> 27:18.724
like "erotic transference."

27:18.767 --> 27:20.073
- Okay, let me explain.
I'll explain it.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.205
If someone is in
a heightened emotional state,

27:22.249 --> 27:23.990
oftentimes they will redirect
their emotions

27:24.033 --> 27:25.426
to their therapist
or their doctor, okay?

27:25.469 --> 27:26.862
- Hmm.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.908
- She's vulnerable,
she's grateful,

27:28.951 --> 27:30.431
she's probably isn't even fully
aware that she's doing it,

27:30.474 --> 27:32.128
so just talk to her.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.130
Let her know you want to keep
the relationship professional,

27:34.174 --> 27:36.219
and the bottom cupping
should subside.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.743
- Thank you.
Thank you.

27:37.786 --> 27:40.702
- All right.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.936
- Maybe you want
to stretch your legs,

27:56.979 --> 27:58.154
get a breath of fresh air?

27:58.198 --> 27:59.852
You've been sitting vigil
all day.

27:59.895 --> 28:03.072
- Yeah, I'm fine right here.

28:04.117 --> 28:08.121
- Can I ask, do you have anyone
helping out at home?

28:08.164 --> 28:10.863
- Just me.
And that is fine.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.778
I don't mind.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.910
- It must be so overwhelming.

28:14.954 --> 28:18.261
- Lena's always been the one
to take care of me,

28:18.305 --> 28:21.743
so when she got sick, I knew
it was my turn to step up.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.745
And I wanted to.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.139
I wanted to take care of her.

28:26.182 --> 28:30.491
Cooking, bathing,
whatever she needs...

28:32.188 --> 28:33.537
I handle it.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.844
- Oliver,

28:35.888 --> 28:38.934
when was the last time
you took time for yourself?

28:41.241 --> 28:43.547
- I'm okay, Dr. Sharpe.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.854
Really, I'm fine.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.162
Right now, my focus is my wife.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.775
She's all that matters.

28:56.865 --> 29:00.521
- Okay, Brendan.
Sorry about that.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.007
- I own a gun.

29:10.183 --> 29:13.882
A Cricket .22.
It was a gift from my old man.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.799
Yeah, I was, um,

29:17.843 --> 29:20.323
I was eight
when he gave it to me.

29:20.367 --> 29:23.065
And I was so excited because

29:23.109 --> 29:25.067
that gun meant that I could
finally go hunting

29:25.111 --> 29:27.069
with him and my brother.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.071
- So you have a kid's gun?

29:29.115 --> 29:30.899
- Well, growing up
in Wisconsin,

29:30.943 --> 29:32.858
believe me,
I had more than just the one.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.860
A bolt action
deer hunting rifle.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.122
A Remington.

29:36.165 --> 29:39.255
Eventually, I got myself
a .270 Winchester...

29:39.299 --> 29:40.909
- Accurate weapon.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.563
- Especially with
the iron sight.

29:42.606 --> 29:45.044
I never thought twice
about my dad's gun collection.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.829
And I could tell you firsthand,
I know the patience

29:47.873 --> 29:49.613
and the discipline you learn
when you're hunting.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.267
And I'll never forget looking
over at my old man

29:51.311 --> 29:53.008
and knowing that he believed

29:53.052 --> 29:54.096
he was teaching me
and my brothers something.

29:54.140 --> 29:57.273
Knowing that he was proud.

29:57.317 --> 30:00.363
Also knowing that might be the
closest I'd ever feel to him.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.150
Guns are no longer
a part of my life,

30:04.193 --> 30:07.196
but I still have that
Cricket .22 disassembled,

30:07.240 --> 30:09.895
under lock and key.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.853
- I get that.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.334
- Yes, Brendan, I am a bleeding
heart liberal New York doctor.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.207
- That's true.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.123
But I also have no problem
with the Second Amendment.

30:21.167 --> 30:25.127
I have absolutely no problem
with responsible gun ownership,

30:25.171 --> 30:28.087
which is why I need you to
start answering my questions.

30:28.130 --> 30:30.219
You think you deserve
that Glock?

30:30.263 --> 30:32.221
Let me help you get it back.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.011
- Okay, we now have 14 patients

30:39.054 --> 30:40.969
who have crashed
without warning.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.015
This spreadsheet lists
every single medication

30:43.058 --> 30:45.147
they have received.
- Find the common link.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.322
- They've all got
normal saline.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.150
- Well, apart from these two.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.282
- What about Ativan?

30:49.325 --> 30:50.979
- No, Lena didn't get that.

30:51.023 --> 30:52.894
Oh, wait.
They all had bandages?

30:52.938 --> 30:55.114
- And alcohol swabs,
but how would that make sense?

30:55.157 --> 30:56.637
- My patient's crashing.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.681
I need an Epi drip
in here stat.

31:01.381 --> 31:03.252
Let's get the drip started
at 2 micrograms a minute.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.167
- Copy that.
- Wild guess.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.995
His heart rate just plummeted
out of nowhere?

31:07.039 --> 31:08.344
- Yeah, faster than a drunk
on a mountain bike.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.172
- What drugs did you give him?

31:10.216 --> 31:12.044
- Uh, a shot of morphine
through an autoinjector line.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.089
- All our other patients
were administered morphine

31:14.133 --> 31:15.961
using the same injector system.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.267
- That's gotta be our link.
- You think an overdose?

31:18.311 --> 31:20.182
- It doesn't make any sense.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.358
These injector syringes come
prefilled at two milliliters.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.056
There's no way that two
milliliters of morphine

31:24.099 --> 31:25.361
cause this kind of reaction.

31:25.405 --> 31:28.974
- Unless what's inside
isn't morphine.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.982
- Liam's labs are all
within normal range.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.984
He meets the age
and weight criteria.

31:39.027 --> 31:42.030
All that's left is
a TTSTAND unassisted.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.685
- Hey, Liam.
Do you like games?

31:44.728 --> 31:47.427
Come check this out.
This is a game we can play.

31:47.470 --> 31:50.299
You can lay on your back
on this mat like me.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.735
Right?

31:51.779 --> 31:53.215
Yeah.
All the way...

31:53.259 --> 31:55.000
Perfect.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.697
And then when we say "go,"
you're gonna roll over

31:56.740 --> 31:59.221
and then you're gonna stand up
as fast as you can.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.397
Can you do that for us?

32:01.441 --> 32:04.009
- Yeah.
- Cool.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.749
All right, buddy,
you stay there.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.447
We'll get us to--wait, wait.
Not yet, not yet.

32:07.490 --> 32:10.276
You stay there, and we're
gonna watch right here, okay?

32:10.319 --> 32:12.713
- He needs to come to a full
standing position unassisted

32:12.756 --> 32:15.063
in under ten seconds
to qualify.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.282
- Ten seconds?

32:16.325 --> 32:17.979
- Well,
I know it sounds extreme,

32:18.023 --> 32:19.415
but it's a marker
for muscle damage.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.200
If he can't meet that time,

32:21.243 --> 32:23.028
we won't benefit
from the trial.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.424
You got this, son.

32:28.468 --> 32:32.080
All you gotta do is get up.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.170
- And begin.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.406
both: Yay!

32:53.449 --> 32:55.147
Great job, buddy.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.062
That was great.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.153
- I'm sorry.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.330
- So...

33:04.373 --> 33:05.505
that's it?

33:07.246 --> 33:10.118
- The exclusion criteria
is clear.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.293
- No, no, no.
Hang on.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.034
He's--he's just warming up.

33:14.079 --> 33:17.082
All right, let's--
let's give him another try.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.779
Okay, come on.
Come down here, buddy.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.215
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.564
That was great.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.263
Okay, great, but uh...

33:24.306 --> 33:25.786
even faster this time.

33:25.829 --> 33:29.137
Okay, can you--
can you do it faster?

33:29.181 --> 33:30.486
- I think so.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.098
That-a-boy.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.490
I know you can.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.840
All right, let me put you back
on your back.

33:36.884 --> 33:40.409
And, uh, nice and fast.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.020
Okay?

33:43.282 --> 33:45.849
Okay.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.460
He's ready.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.592
- And begin.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.337
- Come on, honey.
You can do this.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.437
You got this, son.

34:21.146 --> 34:24.410
- I did it.
- Yes, yes, yes, sweetie.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.457
Yes, sweetie.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.161
- I'm very sorry.

34:50.827 --> 34:54.353
- I may have found something.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.746
It's in Seattle,
which I know is not ideal,

34:56.790 --> 34:58.400
but it's something.

34:58.444 --> 35:03.101
It's a Tier Two trial
that has shown mild success

35:03.144 --> 35:04.754
in slowing down
the degeneration.

35:04.798 --> 35:05.842
- "Mild success"?

35:05.886 --> 35:07.192
- I know.
It's not...

35:09.716 --> 35:13.372
It could buy you
a little more time as a family.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.678
- Can Liam even get in?

35:15.722 --> 35:18.899
- He's in if you want it.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.683
- Yeah, of course we want it.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.120
We slow it down now,

35:22.163 --> 35:24.383
and then we keep our eyes open
for better studies,

35:24.426 --> 35:26.733
for more promising trials
coming down the line,

35:26.776 --> 35:28.126
and then if there's ever
a big breakthrough--

35:28.169 --> 35:33.000
- Well, it doesn't exactly work
like that.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.915
- What do you mean?

35:36.090 --> 35:38.397
These trials use
a deactivated cold virus

35:38.440 --> 35:40.921
to deliver the new gene.

35:40.964 --> 35:44.403
So once Liam's exposed, his
body will develop antibodies.

35:44.446 --> 35:45.882
- Meaning?

35:45.926 --> 35:47.797
- Meaning that
if we ever tried again,

35:47.841 --> 35:49.059
regardless of the trial,

35:49.103 --> 35:52.889
his body would just
destroy the gene.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.458
- So we only get one shot
at this?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.200
- Unfortunately.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.811
- That--that's ridiculous.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.118
There must be something else
that we can do.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.816
- I wish there were.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.688
- We'll do the trial.

36:10.124 --> 36:13.040
- We have to talk about this.
- What is there to talk about?

36:13.083 --> 36:14.781
- You heard what he said.

36:14.824 --> 36:17.175
Best case is mild success
at slowing it down.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.785
- It is better
than doing nothing.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.917
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

36:20.961 --> 36:24.138
- What--what if next year
they develop a cure,

36:24.182 --> 36:29.491
and we have blown our one shot
with this--this half measure?

36:29.535 --> 36:30.840
- He's sick.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.063
He's dying.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.980
How can we do nothing?

36:50.773 --> 36:54.124
- Um, yeah,
divorce can be life-altering.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.953
That idea of the future you had
in your mind, it's gone.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.999
How does that make you feel?

36:59.042 --> 37:02.872
- It hurts.
I loved her.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.134
- I bet it's hard to hear

37:04.178 --> 37:05.788
that she thinks
you're capable of violence.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.487
- She doesn't.
Ellie's just being dramatic.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.489
She wants to take everything
from me.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.752
- Well, who wanted the divorce?

37:13.318 --> 37:16.234
- She says that we,
"grew apart,"

37:16.277 --> 37:18.758
which is just code for,
"she felt like it,"

37:18.801 --> 37:20.150
as far as I'm concerned.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.978
And now the courts
are bending over backwards

37:22.022 --> 37:23.850
to make sure
she's not taken advantage of.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.113
God forbid someone should care
about my rights.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.899
- 'Cause she broke into
your house, right?

37:29.943 --> 37:31.814
- That's right.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.338
- And I bet over
these last few months,

37:33.381 --> 37:35.253
you've really felt like you've
lost control over your life.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.993
- To say the least.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.561
- The night she broke in--
you heard the noise, right?

37:39.605 --> 37:41.259
You grabbed your gun.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.043
Did you feel afraid?
- Hell no.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.132
- What did you feel?
- In charge.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.265
- What else?

37:47.308 --> 37:48.527
- I felt like a man again.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.268
- So you went towards
the sound,

37:50.311 --> 37:52.095
gun in hand,
down the stairs.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.228
What did you wanna do?
- I wanted to handle things.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.056
I wanted to protect
what was mine.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.580
- You aimed the gun, you
realized it's not the burglar,

37:58.624 --> 38:00.278
it's your wife.
- Yeah.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.280
- What'd you do then?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.805
- Nothing.

38:05.848 --> 38:08.286
- You lowered the gun.
- No.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.554
I just kept it there.

38:15.597 --> 38:19.209
Just trained on her,
just for a second or two.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.043
You should've seen
the look on her face.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.095
- Did you ever think about
pulling the trigger?

38:37.053 --> 38:39.621
- No.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.971
Of course not.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.283
I just wanted to scare her.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.332
I wanted her to feel
like I felt for once...

38:57.117 --> 38:58.336
Powerless.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.083
- Mrs. Kent,
thank you for coming.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.998
We have something
quite important to discuss.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.000
- Hmm, that sounds enticing.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.089
- You can leave the door open.
I--

39:13.133 --> 39:14.308
Okay.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.223
Where should we do this
discussing then?

39:16.266 --> 39:17.398
The sofa.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.182
- No, no, no sofa.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.184
I believe what's happening here

39:21.228 --> 39:24.623
is that you are mistaking
your feelings of concern

39:24.666 --> 39:26.364
over your husband's diagnosis
with my own.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.235
- Mmm.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.193
- I mean, you are transferring
your erotic nature to me--

39:30.237 --> 39:31.369
wait, no, no--

39:31.412 --> 39:33.022
- Ooh, what are you trying
to say, Vijay?

39:33.066 --> 39:34.372
- I am not great with words.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.896
- Oh, we don't have to speak.
- Mm-hmm.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.901
Your eyes.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.032
- Go on.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.905
- Oh, Lord.
Come with me.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.255
Hurry up.
- Ooh!

39:50.213 --> 39:52.041
- Robin Kent's MRI results.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.348
- She has a meningioma?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.350
- The tumor is pressing up
against her pleasure center.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.918
It's what has been causing
her heightened libido

39:58.961 --> 40:00.398
and lowered inhibitions.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.443
- She needs surgery right away.
I can schedule it.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.010
- Thank you.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.272
We must make sure
she's healthy enough

40:05.315 --> 40:07.230
to renew her wedding vows.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.276
- How'd you figure it out?

40:09.319 --> 40:12.105
- I saw an uneven dilation
in her pupils.

40:12.148 --> 40:13.280
- You two had to be
pretty close

40:13.323 --> 40:15.064
to notice something like that.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.300
- How can I help?

40:33.343 --> 40:35.302
- I don't think you can.

40:37.478 --> 40:40.350
Jeremy and I just see things
differently.

40:40.394 --> 40:44.703
He wants to wait for a trial
that can cure him,

40:44.746 --> 40:47.488
even though a trial like that
doesn't exist.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.100
- What do you want?

40:55.540 --> 40:58.281
- I...

40:58.325 --> 41:01.981
passed this disease
onto my son.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.245
It came from me.

41:07.247 --> 41:11.120
And I just feel like
I have to do something.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.035
Anything.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.044
- Liam is, um...

41:22.088 --> 41:23.176
he's smart.

41:25.134 --> 41:27.354
He's funny.

41:27.397 --> 41:29.748
He's kind.
Ridiculously adorable.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.101
- And he's strong.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.193
That's what you passed on,

41:40.236 --> 41:42.500
if you ask me.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.806
And you have time

41:44.850 --> 41:46.373
to pass down even more,

41:46.416 --> 41:49.115
regardless of what you
and Jeremy choose.

41:52.205 --> 41:53.423
All we can do...

41:55.208 --> 41:56.514
As parents, really.

41:56.557 --> 41:59.299
I mean...

41:59.342 --> 42:02.258
just try to pass down
the best of ourselves.

42:04.173 --> 42:07.525
To our kids.

42:07.568 --> 42:10.528
In the limited time
that we have.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.405
- Okay, Casey's at the lab with
some of the prefilled syringes.

42:18.448 --> 42:20.233
We'll see what they find out.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.148
- Well, if we can't figure out
what we're giving him,

42:22.191 --> 42:24.150
this man's gonna die
right here on the table.

42:24.193 --> 42:25.281
- Mass spectrometry
test results

42:25.325 --> 42:26.369
are gonna take
at least an hour.

42:26.413 --> 42:28.546
- You have a better idea?

42:28.589 --> 42:30.809
- I'm not sure it's better.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.856
- Lauren!

42:38.207 --> 42:40.122
- What is it?
- It's morphine.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.342
- But it can't be.
Because then that means...

42:42.385 --> 42:44.344
- This isn't why
our patients are crashing.

42:44.387 --> 42:46.476
- Heart rate's bottoming out.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.566
- Start with these.
- No.

42:48.609 --> 42:49.871
This steering column's
made of metal.

42:49.915 --> 42:51.394
- If the pads fire

42:51.438 --> 42:52.570
then the charge will arc
through his chest.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.136
- Well,
that limits our options.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.225
- I'm cracking open his chest.

42:56.269 --> 42:58.184
I need a scalpel
and a sonic bone saw.

42:58.227 --> 42:59.577
- I'll get him prepped.

43:06.192 --> 43:07.628
- I'm starting
the mid sternal thoracotomy.

43:07.672 --> 43:09.195
- Wait!

43:09.238 --> 43:11.110
- Wh-what are you doing?

43:11.153 --> 43:12.241
- What is that?

43:13.939 --> 43:15.418
- It's Narcan.

43:17.333 --> 43:21.337
- Heart rate's rising.

43:21.381 --> 43:22.469
- Saturation's up.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.558
- It's working.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.299
- How did you know?

43:26.342 --> 43:27.866
- This.

43:27.909 --> 43:29.563
That's more than two mls
of morphine.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.434
I'll wager
it's three times that.

43:31.478 --> 43:33.132
- So it wasn't the wrong meds.

43:33.175 --> 43:35.264
- No, these prefilled syringes
were designed

43:35.308 --> 43:36.875
so we wouldn't have to think
about measurements

43:36.918 --> 43:38.180
in the heat of a crisis.

43:38.224 --> 43:39.529
- And these ones came to us
overfilled.

43:39.573 --> 43:41.314
- Which we would've never have
found out in time

43:41.357 --> 43:42.663
if you hadn't
have popped one open.

43:42.707 --> 43:44.447
- We can't be the only hospital
that uses these.

43:44.491 --> 43:45.927
- I'll sound the alarm.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.189
We have a Class Two Recall
on our hands.

43:53.239 --> 43:55.981
-Dr. Frome, you completed
your psychological evaluation

43:56.024 --> 43:58.200
of Brendan Phillips
for the ERPO proceedings?

43:58.244 --> 44:01.682
- I have, your Honor.
- What did you find?

44:01.726 --> 44:03.466
- Uh, Brendan Philips,

44:03.510 --> 44:06.121
he exhibits signs
of repressed anger.

44:06.165 --> 44:07.775
Um, his impulse control
leaves--

44:07.819 --> 44:08.994
- Objection.

44:09.037 --> 44:10.691
- Already ahead of you,
counselor.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.780
Dr. Frome, this is
out of your jurisdiction.

44:12.824 --> 44:14.739
The Red Flag Law asks
two simple questions:

44:14.782 --> 44:18.003
is Brendan Phillips an
immediate threat to himself?

44:22.181 --> 44:23.965
- No.

44:24.009 --> 44:26.707
- Is Mr. Phillips
a threat to others?

44:26.751 --> 44:28.448
- I would say that

44:28.491 --> 44:30.058
he intentionally traumatized
his wife emotionally--

44:30.102 --> 44:31.756
- This isn't a therapy session,
Dr. Frome.

44:31.799 --> 44:33.192
- Mm-hmm.

44:33.235 --> 44:36.195
- Is Mr. Phillips
an immediate threat to others?

44:36.238 --> 44:38.763
Yes or no?

44:38.806 --> 44:41.461
Is he likely to go out
and shoot someone?

44:44.986 --> 44:46.031
- No.

44:46.074 --> 44:48.120
- Thank you.

44:48.163 --> 44:50.122
The ERPO is hereby revoked.

44:50.165 --> 44:52.864
Mr. Phillips, your gun is to be
restored to you by the state,

44:52.907 --> 44:54.866
immediately.

45:02.961 --> 45:04.179
- I knew it.

45:05.964 --> 45:08.096
I knew this wouldn't
do anything.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.756
- Yes, these laws
are far from perfect,

45:15.800 --> 45:17.497
but they're the best
that we have for right now.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.891
- Well, Brendan won't be
the only one armed.

45:21.153 --> 45:23.111
I just bought myself a gun.

45:31.163 --> 45:33.513
- Your heart rate
is back to normal,

45:33.556 --> 45:35.950
and your fasciitis is healing.

45:35.994 --> 45:37.778
I could discharge you today.

45:37.822 --> 45:40.825
But I've been wondering
if that is the best option.

45:40.868 --> 45:42.783
- What do you mean?

45:42.827 --> 45:45.090
- Have you heard
of Respite Care?

45:45.133 --> 45:47.092
- No.
What is that?

45:47.135 --> 45:49.224
- It's like
a temporary nursing home

45:49.268 --> 45:52.271
where Lena could receive
full-time care.

45:54.882 --> 45:57.842
- I--I missed one cut.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.800
I know.

45:59.844 --> 46:01.236
But that doesn't mean

46:01.280 --> 46:03.195
we have to ship my wife off
to a nursing home.

46:03.238 --> 46:05.066
- Respite Care
and Palliative Care

46:05.110 --> 46:07.939
are not just
for terminal patients.

46:07.982 --> 46:09.810
We have a unit right here
at New Amsterdam.

46:09.854 --> 46:13.031
Lena could stay for a month,
even two.

46:13.074 --> 46:17.296
You could visit every day, and
it could give you both a break.

46:18.906 --> 46:21.561
- I can do this, Dr. Sharpe.

46:21.604 --> 46:23.345
- I know you can.

46:23.389 --> 46:26.000
But caregiver burnout
can be just as serious

46:26.044 --> 46:27.262
as Lena's cancer.

46:27.306 --> 46:29.830
Not just for her
but for you.

46:29.874 --> 46:33.399
Respite Care exists
so that you can recharge...

46:34.879 --> 46:37.316
And Lena doesn't feel
like a burden.

46:43.148 --> 46:46.368
- You--you feel like a burden?

46:48.893 --> 46:52.897
- Ollie, are you not
taking care of yourself?

46:52.940 --> 46:57.031
- I--I'm trying, love.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.952
- It's not a respite
from each other.

47:04.996 --> 47:09.174
Because if you cannot
look after yourself,

47:09.217 --> 47:11.263
then you can't look after Lena.

47:21.708 --> 47:24.102
- Okay.

47:24.145 --> 47:26.191
Okay.

47:33.676 --> 47:36.201
- Hey.

47:36.244 --> 47:40.074
We've discussed our options.

47:40.118 --> 47:41.946
- And?

47:41.989 --> 47:44.209
- And, uh,

47:44.252 --> 47:46.994
we decided we'd rather

47:47.038 --> 47:49.344
spend this time together.

47:49.388 --> 47:51.694
As a family.

47:51.738 --> 47:54.915
- And hold out hope that a
better trial might come along.

47:54.959 --> 47:59.224
- There's, uh,
no guarantee that it will.

48:00.399 --> 48:02.401
- There's never a guarantee.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.318
So...

48:06.361 --> 48:10.278
Better not waste
the time you have, right?

48:13.064 --> 48:14.369
- Well, I'm always here.

48:14.413 --> 48:16.110
- Thank you.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.218
- Tough case.

48:39.133 --> 48:41.135
- As a woman who has
lived a full life,

48:41.179 --> 48:43.050
who's, uh,

48:43.094 --> 48:45.313
who is vital and--
and attractive,

48:45.357 --> 48:48.186
you will understand
how I had a certain itch.

48:48.229 --> 48:50.275
People stop seeing you
as a full person

48:50.318 --> 48:53.234
with wants,
and desires, and passions.

48:53.278 --> 48:55.193
We're not invisible.

49:03.331 --> 49:07.466
I'm sorry, Madam Chairwoman,
for speaking out of turn.

49:09.337 --> 49:11.209

49:58.343 --> 49:59.997

Bobbi said she missed you.

50:55.617 --> 50:57.184
- Did she?

50:57.228 --> 50:58.881
- Well, technically,
she said, "I miss mass,"

50:58.925 --> 51:00.535
but she's not Catholic,
so...

51:09.544 --> 51:11.894

- I don't know about you,

51:14.593 --> 51:17.552
but I feel so far from perfect.

51:17.596 --> 51:19.206
- Well, yeah, plus the part

51:19.250 --> 51:21.121
where we're
not actually a family.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.470
