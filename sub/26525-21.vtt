WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.654
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.698 --> 00:04.482
Anyone who knows
Supergirl's secret identity

00:04.526 --> 00:05.788
is at incredible risk.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.833
So, we wipe the minds
of everyone at the DEO

00:07.877 --> 00:08.747
who knows I'm Supergirl.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.488
I have to be mind-wiped, too.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.186
-What happened?
- She changed her mind.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.796
She's gonna keep the baby.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.798
What you're holding
is an experimental serum

00:15.841 --> 00:17.582
that will,
in all likelihood, kill you.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.497
That means it might not.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.456
A Kaznian invasion
on American soil

00:21.499 --> 00:23.501
will be like a child
throwing rocks at a tank.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.677
- Lex has a tank.
- Red Daughter.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.506
Lex Luthor has allied
with the Kaznian government,

00:28.550 --> 00:30.117
and they are going to attack.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.857
I thought it was important
to warn you.

00:31.901 --> 00:32.902
You did the right thing.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.869
Hey. Hey, I...
I've got an idea.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.525
Instead of going to college,
how about not going to college?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.136
Kara, you'll be fine.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.355
You just need to
make some new friends.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.925
Maybe you can
make some friends with rhythm.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.362
No one else gets me.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.843
No one else can get me.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.629
Oh, okay.
Next clapping part coming up.
Don't miss it.

01:04.673 --> 01:08.329
I didn't miss it.
I was just doing
like a jazz version.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.417
Okay, ready?

01:16.598 --> 01:17.642
I did it.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.476
- Kara!

01:25.520 --> 01:26.999
- ...exit visa.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.263
-Or, I should say two.
- Why two?

01:29.306 --> 01:31.439
- He has a lady.
-He'll take one.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.702
I think not.
He certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.139
You okay?

01:36.183 --> 01:39.882
That was a weird dream
or a memory or...

01:39.925 --> 01:43.451
I don't know.
It was about, um,
it was about my sister.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.540
Your sister who was adopted?

01:46.628 --> 01:47.498
Yeah.

01:49.935 --> 01:52.547
An adoption falling through
is a big deal.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.027
And stuff like that
isn't just emotional.

01:55.071 --> 01:58.640
It can make
physiological changes
to your brain

01:58.683 --> 02:00.685
and to the connections
that it makes.

02:00.729 --> 02:01.817
It's weird,

02:01.860 --> 02:04.776
'cause the last time
I felt like this,

02:04.820 --> 02:06.169
I was, uh...

02:06.213 --> 02:07.953
I was being questioned
at the DEO.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.607
It was a security sweep.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.611
Something just feels off,
and I think...

02:13.655 --> 02:15.613
I think
it has to do with Kara somehow.

02:20.401 --> 02:21.663
Brainy, what's up?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.147
I'm on my way.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.760
Jeez, this is America.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.284
You can't just
kidnap a reporter.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.677
And you can't publish
state secrets

02:35.720 --> 02:37.809
when it's
a matter of national security.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.594
My editor already has
all my evidence.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.465
We scrubbed the CatCo servers.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.990
How long are you gonna
keep me here?

02:45.034 --> 02:47.428
Until the President tells us
you aren't a problem anymore.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.865
You know,
I don't really think
that's gonna work for me.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.172
A spider!

02:59.266 --> 03:00.745
You picked on the wrong girl.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.548
Secretary Lockwood
chose to cope with his grief

03:20.591 --> 03:22.724
by going on
a superpowered rampage.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.508
So he injected himself
with Harun-El?

03:24.552 --> 03:26.554
Yeah, and he took
our entire stock.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.947
And then he came back
to trash the place to boot.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.862
Wait. He's the key.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.082
And he's been in front of us
the entire time.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.520
-Lockwood?
-Lockwood must be
connected to Lex.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.740
We went to Kaznia
and we found Lex's lab.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.655
He's been
experimenting on aliens,

03:40.698 --> 03:42.222
trying to harness their powers.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.571
And a lot of these aliens

03:43.614 --> 03:45.573
seem to come from
a DEO facility in the desert.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.618
Find the missing aliens,
find Lex.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.446
But whatever we do,
we better do it fast.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.709
-Lex is planning on
invading America.
-What?

03:51.753 --> 03:52.754
You should've led with that.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.669
Well, then you're gonna
love this.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.584
Lex has a clone of Supergirl.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.542
-What?
-You should've led with that.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.674
A copy was made

03:59.717 --> 04:01.328
when Supergirl
touched the Harun-El.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.459
Her name's Red Daughter

04:02.503 --> 04:04.374
and Lex has taught her
to hate America.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.247
This explains
how Supergirl was framed
for the White House attack.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.728
-Right. So what do we do now?
-I can hunt a rogue Kryptonian.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.817
I will find her. Brainy, go.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.428
Get J'onn
and find those aliens.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.733
I will bring Dreamer with.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.300
We will stop Lex
from using them

04:17.344 --> 04:19.911
for his nefarious purposes.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.740
And I will tell Dreamer
that I am in love with her.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.135
-Great.
-Okay.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.354
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.268
Yeah.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.927
I will rattle Lockwood
and see if he leads us to Lex.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.277
I have a plan.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.756
I just need to borrow something
from the DEO.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.236
-Whatever you need.
-Okay.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.759
Hey, have you heard from Kara?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.370
She's not answering
any of my calls.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.460
She went to tell the President
what we found. Kara's okay.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.766
I'm supposed to kill you,
you know.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.855
I see that.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.555
Kryptonite makes me soft.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.166
I bleed, you shoot me.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.214
I went to Kaznia.

05:02.258 --> 05:06.784
I saw those pictures
you have of me, my sister.

05:06.828 --> 05:10.005
-Know thy enemy.
-Please don't do this.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.921
We are the same.
We have the same genes,
the same--

05:12.964 --> 05:16.794
I see
we've come to the part
where the villain says

05:16.838 --> 05:19.057
"We are not so different,
you and I."

05:19.101 --> 05:20.407
I am not a villain.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.366
"The devil can cite scripture
for his purpose."

05:23.410 --> 05:25.107
Lex Luthor
sent you here, right?

05:25.934 --> 05:27.239
So once you've done
his bidding,

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
what's he gonna do to you?

05:29.807 --> 05:31.243
You're a loose end.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.812
Everything he's told you,
he's lying. He hurts people.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.988
For God's sake,
just look him up.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.948
He did those things
in service to the world.

05:41.863 --> 05:45.257
You are so limited.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.522
Your life could mean so much,

05:48.565 --> 05:52.352
and yet you fly around
in a cheerleader skirt.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.572
How did they do it?

05:55.616 --> 05:57.966
What did they say
to make you believe?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.404
Look out the window
and you will see

06:01.448 --> 06:04.668
fear, racism, strife.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.889
This country
is a fatted heifer.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.892
I am here to cut its throat.

06:11.719 --> 06:12.850
But first...

06:15.636 --> 06:17.246
admit that you were wrong.

06:17.899 --> 06:18.769
Go on.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.902
That you defend the corrupt.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.776
The American dream
is snake oil.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.999
Who sold it to you?

06:32.261 --> 06:33.393
Was it your Alex?

06:35.873 --> 06:38.528
You know, for saying that
you want to know your enemy,

06:38.572 --> 06:40.225
you don't know me at all.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.838
For instance,
that pain you're feeling,

06:43.881 --> 06:46.362
you've only felt it
for the past couple of months.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.059
But me...

06:48.103 --> 06:51.149
I've been dealing
with Kryptonite for 15 years.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.479
What happened?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.090
Just hold still.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.137
Nearly got it. I got it.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.142
I was so close.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.273
I had him.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.449
I...

07:31.276 --> 07:32.843
Now they've destroyed
all my evidence,

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
so I've got nothing.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.107
Lockwood walked,

07:36.151 --> 07:38.588
and people think
Supergirl's an assassin,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.024
and the President
is working with a man

07:40.068 --> 07:42.026
who's almost blown up the world

07:42.070 --> 07:44.333
-more than once.
-Come on. Don't do this.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.465
I told myself,

07:46.248 --> 07:47.858
"Pen's mightier.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.512
Let's do
what Ms. Grant would do."

07:49.556 --> 07:50.992
And it all fell apart.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.777
Look, you'll find a way.
You always do.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.170
Lex knows who I am.

07:56.867 --> 07:57.955
He wants me dead.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.220
Which means
Alex is in danger. I...

08:03.570 --> 08:05.789
J'onn, I have to tell her why.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.400
She has to know
I'm Supergirl. That's...

08:10.533 --> 08:13.014
-She has to know.
-You can't, Kara.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.712
Look, when I wipe
somebody's mind,

08:15.756 --> 08:18.541
I close off neural pathways.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.325
Alex's psyche
has already compensated

08:20.369 --> 08:22.850
for the missing memories.
They're walled off.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.808
If you tell her the truth,

08:24.852 --> 08:27.985
it's like you're taking
a sledgehammer to that wall,

08:28.029 --> 08:30.988
forcing two realities together.
She could go insane.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.337
This can't be forever.

08:32.381 --> 08:35.123
There has...
There has to be a way.

08:38.779 --> 08:39.997
I mean, maybe if she...

08:40.041 --> 08:42.043
Finds out on her own,

08:42.086 --> 08:44.219
remembers on her own. Maybe.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.394
Is that possible?

08:48.484 --> 08:49.920
I don't know.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.882
J'onn, I need your help.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.058
Kara. You're hurt.

08:57.101 --> 09:00.017
I was, but I'm fine now.
Where's Alex?

09:00.061 --> 09:01.845
She's looking into
the Supergirl clone.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.849
Red Daughter.
Lena told us everything.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.286
-She's gonna
get herself killed.
-Don't do this.

09:13.335 --> 09:16.338
Now I could use your help
finding some aliens.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.908
How did you manage this?

09:20.951 --> 09:22.779
Well, the nice thing about
for-profit prisons

09:22.823 --> 09:24.085
is that you can buy them.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.391
You bought a prison
to get me out?

09:26.435 --> 09:27.479
Just for the weekend,

09:27.523 --> 09:28.916
which is long enough
for what I need.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.444
It's a baby Truth Seeker,

09:35.487 --> 09:36.793
and I need the truth.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.622
-You mean, I can't lie?
-Nope.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.929
My middle-school boyfriend,
Taylor.

09:41.972 --> 09:45.062
I paid him $14,000
to never speak to you again.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.282
I knew it.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.590
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
ask you if you love me.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.635
I already know the answer.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.682
If you had 24 hours,
would you be able
to extract the Harun-El

09:55.725 --> 09:57.074
from Ben Lockwood's system?

09:57.118 --> 09:59.120
Yes. Why?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.643
You don't think
you can do it?

10:00.687 --> 10:03.994
Lex has figured out how,
and I haven't cracked it yet.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.083
But your mind works like his.

10:06.127 --> 10:09.086
Well, as much as
I love a challenge,

10:09.130 --> 10:11.393
we both know who
this is really for.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.265
And why would I ever
do anything for Jimmy Olsen?

10:14.309 --> 10:17.834
Oh, because your lunch
was laced with
an exotic neurotoxin,

10:17.878 --> 10:20.271
and, no, I'm not gonna
tell you which one.

10:22.012 --> 10:25.886
I have the antidote,
and you have 24 hours.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.975
I've just given you
the gift of focus.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.977
If this is so important,

10:30.020 --> 10:31.674
why don't you stay
and help me?

10:31.718 --> 10:33.981
Because I've got to find Lex.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.287
You don't happen to know
where he is, do you?

10:36.331 --> 10:38.638
When you find out your child
was plotting matricide,

10:38.681 --> 10:41.292
it tends to cast a pall
over the relationship.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.425
Oh, did he hurt your feelings?

10:43.468 --> 10:46.123
Couldn't you just waterboard me
like a normal person?

10:46.167 --> 10:48.778
-Where are you going?
-To confront Ben Lockwood.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.651
If he's taken the Harun-El,
you should wait until
I finish.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.478
Oh, are you worried about me?

10:53.522 --> 10:55.350
Of course. I love you.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.359
There. You have
gotten me to say it.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.279
Ugh.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.195
Director.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.079
I'm sorry! I'm sorry,
I just came to tell you...

11:30.254 --> 11:32.387
I know you're trying
to find Red Daughter.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.910
You can't be here.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.172
If the President finds out...

11:35.216 --> 11:37.348
He's working with Lex.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.567
-What?
-Yeah.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.700
You need me,

11:40.743 --> 11:44.399
especially if we're gonna
have to fight another me
in the process.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.188
What do you mean
he's unavailable?

11:51.232 --> 11:54.801
I... Well, you can tell
President Baker

11:54.844 --> 11:58.021
that it's an emergency,
and Ben Lockwood--

11:58.065 --> 11:59.370
Hello? Hello...

12:00.328 --> 12:01.459
Hello?

12:02.330 --> 12:03.331
Ben.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.163
If you've, uh, come
for your super-sauce...

12:13.384 --> 12:14.472
Too late.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.998
I know you're working with Lex.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.434
I need to know where he is.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.784
Why do you people
keep insisting
that I know him?

12:21.828 --> 12:24.744
'Cause you're running around
with Otis and Mercy Graves

12:24.787 --> 12:26.746
and they're his henchpeople.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.749
Come on, Benjamin. Last year,
you were an out-of-work
history professor

12:29.792 --> 12:32.577
and now you're a cabinet member
with superpowers.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.666
Do you expect me to believe
that just happened?

12:34.710 --> 12:38.758
The President of
the United States
made me a cabinet member.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
The President works for Lex.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.591
You really didn't know.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.725
Lex played you.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.815
He gave you the training,
the weapons, the fancy job,

12:52.859 --> 12:55.600
and now you've served
your purpose.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.908
Did you never stop to think
that this was all
a little too easy?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.388
Oh, easy.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.694
You think this was...

13:08.962 --> 13:10.877
Okay, listen to me.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.966
This was my idea,

13:13.009 --> 13:15.577
this was my vision,
this was my work!

13:19.102 --> 13:20.800
You wanted to save
the human race.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.500
Instead, you handed its future
to a psychopath.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.904
So?

13:37.947 --> 13:40.384
He had no idea.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.039
The look he gave me,
he hadn't even considered it.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.128
So everything he believed in
is a lie?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.218
And there's another thing.

13:50.177 --> 13:53.484
I think he's deteriorating
because of the Harun-El.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.878
-That's not gonna happen
to me, is it?
-No.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.706
Ben injected
the untested serum.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.447
And by tomorrow,
it won't matter anyway.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.014
I'm working on an extraction.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.021
Is it just me,

14:08.064 --> 14:09.674
or is that a man
who needs answers?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.851
Maybe this wasn't
such a dead end after all.

14:17.204 --> 14:20.511
This is where the latest
Alien Affairs raid took place.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.427
Three aliens were taken.
I can feel their fear.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.916
-Does this mean anything
to you, Brainy?
-What?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.092
I... I don't know.
Where's Nia?

14:36.136 --> 14:37.615
She should be here by now.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.574
There's something
very important
I have to tell her.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.663
Okay, but shouldn't we
try and save the world first?

14:41.706 --> 14:44.144
No! No, that's exactly
why I have to tell her now.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.363
I need to get this
out of my system

14:46.407 --> 14:49.105
before all the punching
and exploding starts.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.585
Causality be damned.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.935
If I tell her how I feel,
normal function will resume.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.024
I'm not sure
that's how love works.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.112
How does it work?

14:56.156 --> 14:57.722
How does what work?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.333
Uh, tacos.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.749
I just had a vision.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.970
That keychain... An alien girl
was riding that unicorn.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.929
She was being chased
by a wolf.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.452
Wolves are symbols
of danger...

15:31.495 --> 15:32.757
Uh, phone.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.889
Sure.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.155
Wolf. Chordata,
Mammalia, Carnivora...

15:39.199 --> 15:40.591
Uh, no, no. Um...

15:40.635 --> 15:43.855
The archaic word for wolf
in Irish is faol...

15:43.899 --> 15:46.815
Faolan Shipping maybe?
They're a subsidiary of
a subsidiary of...

15:47.729 --> 15:49.861
Lex Luthor's favorite
shell company.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
AmerTek.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.786
All right. Private security
cameras everywhere,

16:01.830 --> 16:03.527
power-dampening clubs.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.007
They're guarding
something important.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.617
I have an idea
to get us in.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.752
-We do a Wookiee Gambit.
-Absolutely not.

16:10.795 --> 16:11.971
A Wookiee what?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
You haven't seen Star Wars?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.018
I believe I've been
adequately shamed for that
in the past, thank you.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.935
Basically, J'onn shapeshifts
as a guard and pretends
to bring us in as prisoners.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.719
It's the best way to get in.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.852
Why does everyone
always think getting
captured is the best plan?

16:23.895 --> 16:24.984
Stay in line!

16:27.290 --> 16:28.813
Brainy, tell me the odds.

16:28.857 --> 16:32.687
There is a 56.3% chance
that faking our capture

16:32.730 --> 16:35.124
will lead to
our actual capture.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.170
So, no Wookiee.

16:37.213 --> 16:40.086
Look, I'll fly the perimeter,
see if I can find a safe place
to get us in.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.044
You two stay here,
watch the gate.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.480
Log anything important.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.052
Uh, look, now that we have
a moment alone,

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
I have something
to say to you.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.363
These past few months,
I've really--

16:56.406 --> 16:57.755
I can't believe it!

16:58.539 --> 17:00.062
- What?
-That's her.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.585
The girl from my vision.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.066
The keychain must have
belonged to her.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.634
Brainy, something terrible's
gonna happen to her in there.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.032
You know what,
56.3 isn't that bad

17:13.075 --> 17:14.381
by our standards.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.296
Let's go get her.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.732
Image inducer?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.212
Yes.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.041
I'll have to be someone
they can't say no to.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.352
It is I, Secretary...

17:29.396 --> 17:30.875
Secretary Benjamin Lockwood.

17:30.919 --> 17:34.575
I have captured
the alien outlaw Dreamer.

17:35.837 --> 17:36.881
Open the gate

17:37.447 --> 17:39.710
and allow us entry.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.760
-It's working.
-Obviously.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.418
Dog. How many times
do I have to I tell you,

17:51.461 --> 17:53.463
we cannot keep
enslaving these animals

17:53.507 --> 17:56.553
for our own, uh,
nefarious purposes.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.468
Sorry, sir,
but we have to check.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.564
Our odds of being captured
just went up.

18:14.658 --> 18:18.140
How does it feel
to burn sunlight?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.402
Warm.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.361
Fuzzy.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.451
I feel it in my toes first.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.193
-Is it working?
-I think so.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.239
She's gotta convert
solar radiation
the same as you,

18:30.283 --> 18:34.025
so I am having the satellite
scan for your solar signature

18:34.069 --> 18:36.158
and eliminate every place
we know you've been.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.159
The rest must be her.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.900
Supergirl!

18:38.943 --> 18:40.858
Colonel, I thought
you were in Washington.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.425
Are you insane?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.645
You brought an enemy combatant
into the DEO?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.778
No, she's here because
the real enemies
are on the way.

18:47.822 --> 18:48.910
We were right.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.955
A copy of me
attacked the White House.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.348
A clone, more or less.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.610
The President knew, too.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.612
Baker's been working
for Lex Luthor.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.746
And now Luthor is planning
on attacking the US.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.705
Then, I guess that's why
we should work
together on this.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.105
-Brainy!
-Hey, where are you taking her?

19:12.238 --> 19:13.587
Let her go!

19:20.071 --> 19:21.160
Where is she?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.641
If you hurt her...

19:29.994 --> 19:31.170
You'll what?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.301
Everyone else in here,

19:32.345 --> 19:34.347
they've got these crazy powers.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.871
You, far as I can tell,

19:37.915 --> 19:38.786
are blue.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.529
The girl, on the other hand...

19:43.573 --> 19:45.706
Please, please...

19:45.749 --> 19:48.187
Do whatever you want with me,
but do not hurt her.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.971
Don't worry, she's next.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.930
You will not hurt her!

20:17.520 --> 20:19.609
-Ahhh!

20:22.090 --> 20:25.049
Why would anyone hurt her...

20:25.746 --> 20:27.356
He's done.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.879
On to the other one, boys.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.753
No. No!

20:32.796 --> 20:35.843
No! No, you can't! You can't!

20:38.498 --> 20:41.240
Little boxes. Boxes...

20:42.806 --> 20:45.635
Eventually boxes get opened.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.987
There's a story about that,
right?

20:50.597 --> 20:53.121
It's Greek?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.388
You're just primitives.

20:59.432 --> 21:03.958
And I have worked so hard
to get back here.

21:04.001 --> 21:08.267
You people forget
that time travel is
also space travel too.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.922
You see, Earth is moving at
67,000 miles per hour.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.402
And at different times,
it's in different places,

21:13.446 --> 21:15.317
so you got to do the math
or else you end up in space.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.799
And the math is not easy!

21:18.842 --> 21:21.149
My point is...
My point is, my point is,

21:21.192 --> 21:23.978
I'm from the future.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.980
I think you knocked
the dots off his dice.

21:26.023 --> 21:31.725
What I'm trying to tell you
is that my species has
ancestral memory.

21:31.768 --> 21:36.904
And my ancestors,
very bad people.

21:37.992 --> 21:41.256
They were collectors,
conquerors...

21:43.476 --> 21:46.043
I remember everything!

21:51.701 --> 21:55.270
Uh-oh!

21:56.619 --> 21:59.100
Don't want...

22:07.500 --> 22:09.066
In short, you rebooted me.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.549
Aligned me with my more...

22:13.593 --> 22:16.117
emotionless ancestors.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.991
And that was
a calamitous mistake.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.609
-Stop!

23:01.292 --> 23:02.946
What happened?

23:03.643 --> 23:05.427
I'm free.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.518
Well, Red Daughter's been busy.

23:09.562 --> 23:12.521
Project Claymore.
You remember it?

23:12.565 --> 23:15.437
I remember every secret
government space laser
I've blown up.

23:15.481 --> 23:20.050
I hated that they hid it
from me, so I went to DC
to ask around.

23:20.094 --> 23:23.140
The beam from Claymore
was powered by
an unknown energy source.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.926
There were six engineers
involved in R and D,

23:25.969 --> 23:28.102
and when I tried
to track them down,

23:28.145 --> 23:31.888
I found out they all got
put to bed with a shovel
in the last two weeks...

23:32.541 --> 23:34.413
in these locations.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.285
Luthor's trying to get
a hold of Claymore technology.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.809
We need to find him
and stop him from getting it,

23:39.853 --> 23:43.596
but right now, our priority
is finding Red Daughter.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.164
So if we
triangulate these hits,
can we get an address?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.082
These are all
downtown National City.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.954
Different times of the day
and night.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.434
Do you think she's living here?

23:59.612 --> 24:01.570
We won't be able
to send back-up.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.137
Not without knowing
who we can trust.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.574
It's fine. I'll find her alone.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.663
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.273
We'll find her. I'm coming too.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.840
No,
it's too dangerous.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.494
You'll be safer here,
Director.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.366
Why are you acting so weird?
We're hunting her together.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.325
I just need you to trust me.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.022
I'm going alone.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.507
Oh, Rao.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.988
You're stalking me.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.428
They're draining alien power
and converting it to
kinetic energy for use in

25:17.472 --> 25:20.606
what looks like a version of
the Claymore particle weapon.

25:20.649 --> 25:24.566
Yet there does not appear to be
any extraction equipment
on premises.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.786
I did find
a Transmatter Portal.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.963
Then they must be moving
the alien prisoners
to a second location

25:30.006 --> 25:31.573
to drain their power.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.488
We must find and disable it.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.057
Yeah, sure. But, Brainy,
what about Dreamer?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.581
Yes. She could be useful.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.499
I believe I know
where they took her.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.066
Hey, are you...

25:46.109 --> 25:47.415
Are you feeling okay?

25:48.242 --> 25:51.419
I am not experiencing any pain.

26:21.144 --> 26:24.757
Didn't think
you'd die today.
Dine on bullets.

26:36.159 --> 26:40.642
Oh! If it isn't
Secretary Liberty.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.992
Big Ben! Proud of you, buddy.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.953
Mmm. Hey.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.347
What's up?

26:50.391 --> 26:53.176
Kind of busy here, lying low,
waiting on the next step
of the plan.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.396
Yeah.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.006
In the old safehouse.

26:57.050 --> 27:00.183
Yeah. Lex didn't want me
to use it, but...

27:00.227 --> 27:02.533
I had to. I'm sentimental,
you know?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.188
My sister, she loved this spot.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.887
Your sister...

27:07.930 --> 27:10.672
When you and your sister
approached me...

27:11.673 --> 27:13.588
were you working for Lex then?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.894
Of course.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.287
Luthor wanted me
to become Agent--

27:17.331 --> 27:19.507
Hey! Nobody told you
to wear the mask.

27:19.550 --> 27:20.813
That was all you.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.816
But the rest of it, yeah.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.948
Well, I don't see
the problem, man.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.081
It's a win-win-win.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.258
Win-win.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.130
I lost everything.

27:34.174 --> 27:37.699
No. You get power, I get money,
Lex gets more money.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.659
Otis, so you're saying that
everything that's happened,
all of this,

27:40.702 --> 27:43.052
you're telling me that
it's all about money?

27:43.096 --> 27:44.837
And world domination.

27:46.577 --> 27:47.796
It's kind of his thing.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.798
I get it. No.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.582
Supervillain, right. I get it.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.890
Otis, what's he planning?

27:54.934 --> 27:58.720
Fun time in Kaznia.
Paper tigers, man.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.722
Paper tigers.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.724
It's "paper tigers."

28:02.768 --> 28:04.726
It's a false flag operation.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.903
Lex convinces Kaznia
to invade the US,
betrays them--

28:07.947 --> 28:09.992
And then he stops it himself.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.168
Lex becomes the hero
he always thought he was.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.605
You know the rules,
now that I told ya...

28:15.128 --> 28:16.564
I gotta kill you.

28:18.479 --> 28:22.483
Kind of fits. Seeing as
I'm the one who picked you.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.834
Boring old Ben Lockwood.

28:25.878 --> 28:29.533
Otis, the, uh...
The name...

28:31.797 --> 28:33.668
-...is Liberty.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.282
No, no, no, no, Lockwood.
We need him to find Lex.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.550
- James!

28:46.594 --> 28:47.726
- Now you're dead.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.427
Harsh, bro.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.302
Game over.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.611
James? James,
I'm gonna fix this.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.443
-Brainy.
-The fifth.

29:09.486 --> 29:12.576
Give me four seconds
to release your bindings.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.404
But how did you escape?

29:14.448 --> 29:17.320
Your hands are free.
Give me four more seconds.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.844
You can hack the network now?

29:18.887 --> 29:20.106
Yes.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.021
I am much more focused.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.718
Then you can free
all the captive aliens.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.417
Actually, there's something
I have to tell you.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.638
Brainy...

29:34.468 --> 29:36.557
I'm not going to release you.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.517
What are you doing?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.345
You have to go through
the portal.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.478
What?

29:44.521 --> 29:46.959
Once you're on the other side,
astral project.

29:47.002 --> 29:50.701
Inform me of the location
and we'll liberate the camp
and foil Luthor.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.836
Brain... Brainy,
you can't do this.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.795
I thought you would be happy.

29:56.838 --> 30:00.973
After all, this was your idea
in the first place.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.671
Brainy. Brainy. Brainy!

30:03.714 --> 30:04.759
Brainy!

30:06.195 --> 30:08.545
Brainy, where's Dreamer?

30:08.589 --> 30:09.938
I left her behind.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.374
She'll send us
an astral projection

30:11.418 --> 30:13.376
when she arrives
at the next location.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.857
We are not leaving her alone.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.512
You're right.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.384
We double our odds
if you're taken through
the gate with her.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.953
Brainy.

30:24.997 --> 30:28.174
You will regain your ability
to move in two minutes,
14 seconds.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.871
Just enough time
for you to be captured.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.612
And if you both fail,

30:31.655 --> 30:34.223
well, then I'll just
think of something else.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.661
I always do.

30:48.934 --> 30:49.891
Mikhail.

30:52.502 --> 30:53.373
Hey.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.810
Alex, what are you doing here?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.594
I told you,
you're not leaving me behind.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.597
Why does this place

31:00.641 --> 31:02.817
look so much like
my sister's apartment?

31:02.861 --> 31:03.862
Alex...

31:03.905 --> 31:05.037
I know...

31:05.080 --> 31:06.908
This is all very strange.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.388
Oh, my God.

31:08.431 --> 31:10.129
I can see
Kara's loft from here.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.175
It's like she's stalking her.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.481
But Kara's gonna be okay.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.874
You don't have to
worry about her.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.006
Unless you have a sister
you don't understand...

31:18.050 --> 31:19.486
this feeling.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.402
I had one.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.320
Oh.

31:28.277 --> 31:31.454
Well, then you know it--

31:32.455 --> 31:34.675
It's like a piece
of my heart is out there

31:34.718 --> 31:37.243
and it's just wandering
around in the world,

31:37.286 --> 31:40.289
and it's on its own
and I can't protect it.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.944
I can't protect her.

31:42.988 --> 31:43.945
And no matter what, I mean,

31:43.989 --> 31:46.382
there's always
gonna be danger.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.254
But I can't always
be there for her,

31:48.297 --> 31:51.126
and this is...
This is not...

32:03.922 --> 32:05.793
I'm sorry. I, uh...

32:06.968 --> 32:08.491
Mom, hey, um,
is everything all right?

32:08.535 --> 32:10.711
Oh, yes, honey.
Just wanted to let you know

32:10.754 --> 32:11.799
that Kara just got here.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.149
Oh, good. Is she okay?

32:14.193 --> 32:16.325
Oh, yeah.
She asked me to call you

32:16.369 --> 32:18.371
just to make sure
you knew she was safe.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.460
-Red Daughter is there.
-What?

32:20.503 --> 32:22.157
Eliza, uh... She's in danger.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.419
Tell her to get out!

32:25.117 --> 32:27.510
Mom, are you still there?

32:29.034 --> 32:29.991
Mom?

32:39.044 --> 32:39.870
Eliza?

32:41.307 --> 32:42.699
Kara...

32:43.918 --> 32:45.920
Don't hurt her, please.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.487
I've been here for hours.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.619
You have all these...

32:50.533 --> 32:52.231
things.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.450
You think they
will make you whole?

32:55.756 --> 32:57.149
I had none of it.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.673
-You can still have it.
-I don't want it.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.718
Then why do you have
an apartment in the city?

33:02.719 --> 33:04.156
I know you
have doubts about Lex--

33:04.199 --> 33:06.375
His name is Alex!

33:06.419 --> 33:08.769
Okay, okay, easy.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.901
You protect individuals.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.729
That is weakness.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.732
I serve the collective.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.038
What about Mikhail?

33:20.215 --> 33:22.000
I know he's important to you.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.961
Interesting that you
should bring Mikhail up.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.444
Americans killed him.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.011
Ahhh!

33:48.678 --> 33:50.550
Mom, Kara,
please pick up.
I don't know what's wrong.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.074
Supergirl's headed to you
and I'm on my way as well.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.082
Luthor will betray Kaznia.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.389
And he will betray you.

34:03.432 --> 34:06.566
-No, he fights for--
-Himself!

34:06.609 --> 34:09.395
-That's all he's ever done.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.658
Not everyone
is as selfish as you.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.592
Hope, help,
and compassion for all.

34:32.635 --> 34:34.289
That's what I stand for.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.248
You will not be able
to stand at all

34:36.291 --> 34:37.640
when I am done with you.

34:43.298 --> 34:44.908
How do you
think this ends?

34:44.952 --> 34:46.432
We have the same powers.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.955
Not exactly.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.783
I am evolved.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.286
Submit.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.636
Not while I'm still breathing.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.551
Kara!

36:25.139 --> 36:26.662
Here's to the Danvers sisters.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.361
Let me save you this time.

36:29.404 --> 36:32.102
Kara.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.238
No.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.373
No!

37:05.440 --> 37:08.182
No. No, no, no. No.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.357
Hey.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.758
No. You can't go now.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.587
I remember... everything.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.720
Kara, we're here, we're here.
We're here together.

37:24.764 --> 37:25.939
And I know you.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.810
I know you better
than anybody knows you.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.377
And I know
that you don't quit.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.250
So you can't go now!

37:33.207 --> 37:35.383
Kara, you can't go!

37:40.736 --> 37:42.129
No, no!

37:46.699 --> 37:48.222
Alex.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.964
It's okay. Mom, she's...
She's okay.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.966
She's gonna be fine.
It's just dark,

37:53.009 --> 37:55.621
so there's no sunlight,
but there's...

37:56.361 --> 37:57.840
There's sunlight
in everything.

37:57.884 --> 38:01.104
There's sunlight in the grass.

38:01.148 --> 38:03.455
So, Kara, just take it.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.719
Take the grass!

38:07.546 --> 38:08.590
Please.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.593
Kara, no.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.468
Please don't leave me.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.622
Alex, she's doing it.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.276
She's pulling the sunlight.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.522
I'm here. I'm here.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.611
I've missed you so much.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.308
I really missed you.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.276
-Lillian.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.843
-Is it ready?
- Yes.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.889
Here. Bring him here.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.631
-It's okay.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.676
-Here.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.635
-Starting extraction.
-No!

39:36.678 --> 39:39.072
We don't know what's coming.
I need my strength.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.422
-You're unstable.
-Then stabilize me.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.076
-We don't know how.
- Actually,

39:43.119 --> 39:44.512
another dose of the Harun-El
would do it.

39:44.556 --> 39:45.948
We don't know
what that would do to him.

39:45.992 --> 39:48.255
I've been
studying it all day, dear.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.517
I've learned things.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.302
Would I lie?

39:53.565 --> 39:54.566
Do it.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.754
Thank you.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.409
You're welcome, Jimmy.

40:14.542 --> 40:15.456
Drink this.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.460
Oh, come now.
You didn't really poison me.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.551
You should drink it.

41:08.988 --> 41:10.903
-Colonel Haley.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.819
I found the connection
with Claymore.
It was a prototype.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.821
They made a compact version.

41:15.864 --> 41:16.909
How compact?

41:16.952 --> 41:18.650
Small enough for a Lexosuit.

41:18.693 --> 41:20.390
Has he used it?

41:20.434 --> 41:21.870
...an invasion of
our country...

41:21.914 --> 41:23.437
Turn on the television.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.570
...by the dangerous
rogue state of Kaznia...

41:25.613 --> 41:28.181
...by none other
than Supergirl.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.400
These images,
captured moments ago,

41:30.444 --> 41:33.839
prove that one man
single-handedly

41:33.882 --> 41:36.929
thwarted the invaders
and killed the terrorist,

41:36.972 --> 41:37.930
Supergirl.

41:38.757 --> 41:40.193
That man is...

41:40.236 --> 41:41.716
Lex Luthor.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.677
Mr. Luthor,
a grateful nation thanks you.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.417
How did this happen?
