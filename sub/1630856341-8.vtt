[officer on radio] <i>Inspector, we have
a young man and young woman</i>

16:53.500 --> 16:54.541
<i>who fit the profile.</i>

16:54.541 --> 16:56.125
<i>Both are Spanish, around 30 years old.</i>

16:56.125 --> 16:58.375
<i>They've stolen a police car
at the local hospital.</i>

16:58.375 --> 17:00.125
<i>Two agents are being held in Nevers.</i>

17:00.125 --> 17:01.666
- Do you have any photos?
- Negative.

17:01.666 --> 17:04.916
I want roadblocks established
within a 30-kilometer radius.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.625
And I want
aerial surveillance immediately.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.750
[dispatcher] <i>Attention, all units.</i>

17:09.750 --> 17:13.208
<i>We are searching for car 224-R.
Two agents are being held hostage.</i>

17:13.208 --> 17:17.083
<i>The vehicle was last seen
on highway A-77 at Saint Eloi.</i>

17:17.083 --> 17:19.458
Every police unit
in the country's looking for us.

17:19.458 --> 17:20.833
Time to change cars.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.208

[tires squeal]

RIVER PORT

17:30.375 --> 17:32.250
That way. Maybe we can steal a boat.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.291
Careful with the guns.

17:34.541 --> 17:36.166
[brakes screech]

[Bruce] Perfect.

18:09.125 --> 18:11.625
- [Bruce] Let's go. C'mon!
- [Keila] Faster.

18:13.916 --> 18:15.125
[officer 1 grunting]

18:16.041 --> 18:18.333
Relax, man. I know what I'm doin', okay?

18:18.333 --> 18:20.041
There's eight milligrams of propofol

18:20.041 --> 18:22.666
and eight milligrams of diazepam
per person.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.500
That's the same dose
you get for open-heart surgery.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.708
[officer 1 sniffles]

18:26.708 --> 18:28.708
- [officer 2 shouting]
- Shh! Shh.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.791
For the next ten hours,
you're gonna sleep like a baby.

18:32.791 --> 18:34.583
Sweet dreams.

18:40.291 --> 18:41.291
Thank you so much.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.500
If you hadn't picked me up,
I probably wouldn't be alive right now.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.583
Shh. I hope that you'll get some rest

18:49.583 --> 18:52.833
and that, um,
you don't end up suffering from PTSD.

18:52.833 --> 18:53.750
Goodbye.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.208
I'm gonna try to steal one of these boats.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.000
I'll take care of the car. Take these.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.916

[energetic rock music playing]

19:44.291 --> 19:46.208
I hope they've got good insurance.

19:47.958 --> 19:49.083
Yeah, they should.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.625
[motor revs]

[driver grunts]

20:02.958 --> 20:04.458

20:19.625 --> 20:20.958
Stop the engine.

20:21.750 --> 20:22.666
What's going on?

20:24.083 --> 20:26.375
Step down from the vehicle
and open the trailer.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.958
[tense music swells]

20:31.375 --> 20:32.791
[door opens]

20:34.958 --> 20:37.333
It's empty.
I'm not carrying anything, sir.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.583
Police inspection.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.708
Grab onto the bar,
and put your head on top.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.291
[Roi grunts]

20:46.083 --> 20:48.791
- When I tell you, arch your body.
- [Cameron grunts]

20:50.791 --> 20:52.083
- [Roi] Now.
- [door clangs]

20:57.583 --> 20:58.625
I told you, it's empty.

21:04.208 --> 21:06.458
[bars creaking]

21:11.625 --> 21:13.583
[both panting]

21:16.708 --> 21:18.000
Okay, close it up.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Thank you, sir.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.166
[both exhale]

21:34.958 --> 21:36.500
[tense music swells]

21:36.500 --> 21:37.791
They're comin' back.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.125
Opposite way. Underneath the bar.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.125
- Now!
- [both strain]

21:51.708 --> 21:53.125
[Cameron inhales sharply]

21:53.125 --> 21:54.333
[softly] I can't.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.750
Hold on. You can do it, Cameron.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.166
[tense music rises]

22:00.208 --> 22:01.416
[both panting]

22:03.125 --> 22:04.833
[officer] There's nothing, sir.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.291
All right. You can leave now.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.500
- [both sigh]
- [bright instrumental music playing]

22:19.458 --> 22:21.000
[quietly] We're moving again.

[exhales deeply]

22:30.708 --> 22:33.416
[bright music building]

22:37.291 --> 22:39.250
- [music fades]
- We're done. Let's go.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.583
- [sirens approaching]
- Hold on. The police just arrived.

22:41.583 --> 22:42.833
[brakes squeak]

22:42.833 --> 22:45.166
[ominous music playing]

22:48.666 --> 22:50.416
I just got here.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.583
- [sighs]
- [bell dings]

22:51.583 --> 22:53.541
Just two cars for now.

22:53.541 --> 22:57.291
- It seems your mistress turned us in.
- No. No, no, no. That's the good news.

22:57.291 --> 23:00.875
If she had turned us in,
there'd be a lot more than just two cars.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.083
But obviously they're here
to follow up on something.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.708
They'll wanna check the CCTV.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.916
We'll have to stay here for the moment.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.833
- [ominous music fades]
- [line ringing]

23:09.833 --> 23:11.666
[cell phone ringing]

23:14.125 --> 23:15.000
<i>- Berlin?</i>
- Keila?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.125
I need you to hack the hotel's CCTV.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.583
- I already did. It's deleted.
<i>- The police are in the lobby.</i>

23:19.583 --> 23:22.333
Turn off the corridor cameras
so we can leave.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.000
Then erase the hard drives,
including the wedding reception.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.166
I can't. I'm in a boat on a river,
running from the police right now.

23:28.166 --> 23:31.000
If you don't do this in four minutes,
Damián and I are dead men.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.291
[takes a deep breath]

23:38.958 --> 23:39.916
What's goin' on?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.000
I need a better signal!

23:42.583 --> 23:44.708
Inspector Lavelle, Criminal Investigation.

23:44.708 --> 23:46.458
We are looking for two suspects

23:46.458 --> 23:49.333
who may have stayed in this hotel
last week, or maybe even longer.

23:49.333 --> 23:51.958
We don't know how many stayed,
but we do know they're Spanish.

23:51.958 --> 23:55.625
It's possible they <i>were</i> guests
at the hotel, but... I'm not sure.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.791
- Yeah.
- [receptionist] Hey, wait...

24:00.166 --> 24:02.458
She looks like the woman
who stayed in 313.

24:04.666 --> 24:05.708
Let me check.

24:09.166 --> 24:11.250
[error messages beeping]

24:11.833 --> 24:13.041
[Keila] The signal's too weak!

24:13.041 --> 24:16.000
Can you go faster?
We need to find another relay.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.166
You got it.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.250
- [motor revs]
- [energetic music playing]

24:23.750 --> 24:25.250
This is unusual.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.166
Some guest files have been deleted.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.166
And from what I can see,
it's that Spanish group.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.916
If I may, we've had a Spanish group
staying with us

24:32.916 --> 24:34.625
for the past 17 days.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.333
Five of them checked out a few days ago.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.666
One of the guests just returned today.

24:38.666 --> 24:41.125
He's staying with the last member
of that group.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.166
Quite a strange man, actually.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.666
He would never let us
in to clean his room.

24:45.666 --> 24:47.125
They're upstairs in 503.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.416
Call the backup units.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.375
Fred, no one can leave.

24:52.375 --> 24:53.416
Got it.

24:53.416 --> 24:56.208
Hey, do you have a monitor room
where I can check the security cameras?

24:56.208 --> 24:57.458
Yes, we do.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.166
I'll take care of the CCTV.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.291
Follow me.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.125
And I need you to get your master key.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.333
Keila, what the hell is going on?

25:07.333 --> 25:09.083
It's really slow. The signal's too weak.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.666
We need to get out of the canyon.
Bruce, can you go faster?

25:11.666 --> 25:12.958
This is as fast as it goes.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.125
- [gun clicks]
- You two, the stairs. Go, go!

25:18.125 --> 25:21.541
[officer] Sorry, it's an emergency.
Excuse me. It's an emergency.

25:21.541 --> 25:24.375
- What's going on?
- We're almost out of the canyon!

25:24.875 --> 25:25.750
Bruce, faster!

25:25.750 --> 25:27.083
[motor revs]

25:27.083 --> 25:28.666
[tense music playing]

25:31.416 --> 25:32.916
[tense music swells, fades]

25:32.916 --> 25:34.708
These are
all the security cameras you have?

25:34.708 --> 25:36.166
[guard] Mm-hmm.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.833
[epic music playing]

25:44.333 --> 25:46.375
We're almost there.
You should have a signal!

25:46.375 --> 25:48.291
- [laptop chimes]
- We're good! It's working!

25:48.291 --> 25:50.958
- Dammit, Andrés. Come on.
- [Keila] I'm on the server.

25:50.958 --> 25:53.875
I have to specify and select
the recordings where you appear.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.250
Otherwise, it'll look suspicious.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.625
Erase it all. Everything.
And disconnect the cameras on our floor.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.583
Done! Now the cameras.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.541
I don't know
which cameras are on your floor.

26:06.541 --> 26:08.875
- I can only see numbers!
- Take them all down!

26:08.875 --> 26:10.458
[elevator bell dings]

26:10.458 --> 26:11.875
Police emergency. Sorry.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.375
[monitor clicks off]

26:19.625 --> 26:21.875
Somebody's taking down
all the cameras in real time.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.166
Give me the master key.

26:29.083 --> 26:29.916
Hurry up!

26:31.708 --> 26:32.916
Cameras are disconnected!

26:33.875 --> 26:34.833
Let's go.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.583
We're almost there.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.416
[guns cock]

26:44.291 --> 26:45.500
[elevator bell dings]

26:49.500 --> 26:51.208
[tense music fades]

26:52.916 --> 26:55.166
[energetic music playing]

27:05.791 --> 27:06.875
Police, open up!

27:14.416 --> 27:15.416
[lock clicks open]

27:21.208 --> 27:22.708
[energetic music continues]

27:25.416 --> 27:27.083
Forget it. They left.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.250
[Damián sighs]

27:48.666 --> 27:50.166
[Lavelle coughs]

27:50.750 --> 27:51.875
[Sierra coughs]

27:57.125 --> 27:58.708
[energetic music continues]

28:01.250 --> 28:02.250
[garage opener beeps]

28:04.291 --> 28:06.041
They're still in the hotel.

28:06.916 --> 28:09.458
Lock down the hotel!
Emergency exits and parking!

28:18.125 --> 28:20.750
[rhythmic, energetic music continues]

28:32.250 --> 28:34.333
[siren wails]

28:34.333 --> 28:36.291
[officer on radio]
<i>No sign of the suspects.</i>

28:42.083 --> 28:42.916
[under breath] Shit.

28:42.916 --> 28:45.000
[energetic music ends]

28:47.208 --> 28:49.208
- [somber music playing]
- [Camille sighs]

28:51.583 --> 28:54.166
Sweetie, I've said nothing
because I'm your friend.

28:55.041 --> 28:57.166
Because we're all free
to live the life we want.

28:57.166 --> 29:00.458
Your husband, though...
he may not be a gangster like Simón,

29:00.458 --> 29:02.125
but the bastard's still a fraud.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.500
Are you comparing my husband with a man
who spies on me with telescopes?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.583
No, of course not. [sighs]

29:08.250 --> 29:11.291
But your husband led you to believe
you were living a modern love story.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.500
And that at night,

29:12.500 --> 29:14.791
you could embrace the world
like some bohemian muse

29:14.791 --> 29:15.958
because you were free.

29:15.958 --> 29:17.500
You weren't free at all.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.375
You were alone.

29:20.375 --> 29:24.208
And meanwhile, there he was,
taking selfies at the pyramids

29:24.208 --> 29:27.916
with another woman, his secret love child,
and a substitute mother-in-law.

29:27.916 --> 29:30.833
And your idea
is to get one bastard out of jail

29:30.833 --> 29:31.916
and put the other one in?

29:31.916 --> 29:33.166
Oh no!

29:37.166 --> 29:38.916
I feel so stupid.

29:40.166 --> 29:41.250
I feel so guilty.

29:41.958 --> 29:44.500
Guilty? Sweetie, not at all. Look at me.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.375
- Did you steal anything?
- No, of course not.

29:47.375 --> 29:50.250
I don't know, do you have, uh...
a hidden child somewhere,

29:50.250 --> 29:52.041
uh, that you forgot to mention?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.333
No, but I had an affair.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.000
Sweetie, there's no comparison.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.291
Let me make myself very clear.
In this story, there are two losers.

29:58.291 --> 30:02.125
You, the number one loser,
graduated with honors and distinction.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.125
And the second loser is your husband.

30:04.125 --> 30:06.958
There's only one winner. Simón.

30:06.958 --> 30:10.416
What needs to happen now
is that <i>you</i> become the winner.

30:10.416 --> 30:12.000
Make <i>them</i> the losers.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.750
And how am I supposed to do that?

30:15.125 --> 30:18.333
By taking what he loves. His money.

30:18.333 --> 30:21.625
[sighs] No. No, you're crazy.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.166
- Camille, think about it.
- Susi, you're insane.

who's been planning
this robbery for years?

30:27.041 --> 30:30.250
Nobody even knows how he got in.
Maybe he's part of the Mafia.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.458
Who cares about that?

30:31.458 --> 30:34.916
You know the identity of one
of the world's most wanted men.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.791
One phone call from you,
and it's 20 years in jail for him.

30:37.791 --> 30:41.000
But what do we gain from that? Nothing.

30:41.583 --> 30:42.875
And tell me something, Camille.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.750
If you were Simón,
wouldn't you gladly give some cash

30:45.750 --> 30:46.833
to avoid jail?

[tense music playing]

30:48.791 --> 30:50.041
How much is "some"?

30:50.625 --> 30:53.875
If we ask for 20%,
we'd be wasting a good hand.

30:53.875 --> 30:58.041
Sixty percent, we'd be asking for trouble.
Forty percent is reasonable.

31:45.666 --> 31:48.750
You have ten seconds

I've had it since I was 13.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.500
My mom died giving birth.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.500
My dad took it pretty bad.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.875
He had to raise me and look after me.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.750
The kid who killed his wife.

33:24.208 --> 33:26.583
I guess life
dealt both of us a shitty hand.

33:28.125 --> 33:30.625
I'd lost my mother, and my dad hated me.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.916
He had lost his wife and hated his son.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.375
[scoffs]

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
I used to be so angry, you know?

33:38.500 --> 33:41.333
Sitting in school all day was really hard.

33:42.458 --> 33:44.958
So at lunchtime, I'd take off and leave.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.458
[Cameron sighs]

33:50.000 --> 33:51.416
And where would you go?

33:52.041 --> 33:53.291
Abandoned places.

33:54.791 --> 33:58.166
I'd hang out
with all the good boys. [chuckles]

33:59.333 --> 34:01.500
Fuck, we fought for anything back then.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.958
For a ball, for a bike, for a girl.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.708
[Cameron chuckles]

34:08.000 --> 34:12.416
Then, when I'd get home,
the school had already called.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.500
[sighs] My dad, he'd put me in a chair...

34:17.333 --> 34:19.041
And he'd start to get rough with me.

34:19.041 --> 34:21.666
I'm gonna teach you
how to sit still in class.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.541
The self-control method.

34:24.541 --> 34:26.416
[father] The self-control method.

34:26.416 --> 34:30.416
You're gonna learn not to get into fights
or any of that other shit you get into.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.541
Put your hand there.

34:32.791 --> 34:34.375
- Do what I say.
- [hand slams]

[young Roi breathing shakily]

That's when he would burn my knuckles.

<i>With his cigarette.</i>

34:45.875 --> 34:48.208
[young Roi panting]

And that son of a bitch
would always take his time.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.708
You see? You learned how to sit still.

34:54.416 --> 34:55.958
[Roi] <i>So I ran away from home.</i>

34:55.958 --> 34:58.416
My career as a thief
began at 13. [chuckles]

34:59.833 --> 35:02.666
But with no experience
in the art of thievery,

35:03.500 --> 35:06.166
I'd been to court three times
by the age of 17,

35:06.166 --> 35:08.416
and in and out of reform schools
like a boomerang.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.458
And then I met Berlin.

35:11.458 --> 35:12.875
I'm so sorry.

35:17.000 --> 35:17.875
Why?

35:18.875 --> 35:22.208
There I was, telling you about my shit,
when you had real problems.

35:30.791 --> 35:32.833
And is the goat from back then as well?

35:33.333 --> 35:34.916
That was Berlin's idea.

35:35.416 --> 35:36.333
[Cameron] Really?

35:38.083 --> 35:42.250
He said, "You and I
both have the devil in us."

35:44.416 --> 35:46.458
"Next time you hear the devil calling,

35:48.958 --> 35:51.916
and you're about to beat
some poor bastard to death,

35:56.125 --> 35:57.583
look at the tattoo."

35:58.416 --> 36:00.166
"And beat the devil to the punch."

36:00.166 --> 36:02.083
Remember the guy from the race?

36:03.541 --> 36:05.875
I just whipped your ass!

36:05.875 --> 36:08.333
[Roi] <i>Another time,
I would've taken a wrench from the trunk</i>

36:08.333 --> 36:09.791
and smashed his head in.

36:11.125 --> 36:14.833
Thanks to Berlin, I looked at the goat,
and I won.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.333

45:24.791 --> 45:27.583
The landscapes
and the nature are beautiful.

45:28.541 --> 45:31.541
Hello? Where'd you go?
We spent the night together,

45:31.541 --> 45:34.125
but I don't think you were
with me more than ten minutes.

45:34.125 --> 45:36.666
[somber piano music playing]

45:36.666 --> 45:39.458
To be honest,
I'm trying to get over a relationship.

45:39.458 --> 45:40.458
[woman] Mm.

45:40.458 --> 45:43.041
Last night, when I saw you
at the bar, I thought this might be

45:43.041 --> 45:46.125
the last night of my old life
and the beginning of my new life.

45:46.125 --> 45:49.666
But this morning,
I felt once again the same emptiness.

45:51.250 --> 45:52.791
[woman sighs sadly]

45:52.791 --> 45:56.666
[sighs] I think it's best
if we go our separate ways.

45:57.166 --> 45:59.458
Yes. I think so too.

45:59.458 --> 46:01.125

[breathing shakily]

46:21.458 --> 46:23.250
[tense music rises]

46:39.625 --> 46:41.708
I've been hiding there for a week.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.875
At that café you told me about.

46:44.875 --> 46:48.666
[echoing] Whenever I'm in Madrid,
I always go to the same place.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.125
The Buenos Aires Café.

46:50.125 --> 46:53.000
[Camille] <i>And yesterday,
I finally saw you.</i>

46:53.000 --> 46:54.958
I wanted to turn you in to the police.

46:54.958 --> 46:57.416
I was so angry
I wanted you to feel that pain.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.500
But when I saw you with that woman,
well... my heart skipped a beat.

47:04.458 --> 47:07.125
I realized then
that I was just fooling myself

47:07.125 --> 47:09.041
with my ideas of wanting revenge.

47:11.291 --> 47:12.750
I wanted to see you, Simón.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.708
That's the only thing I wanted.

47:29.458 --> 47:31.208
[somber music playing]

47:32.375 --> 47:34.166
[Berlin sighs on headset]

47:34.166 --> 47:37.208
<i>I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you either.</i>

47:38.333 --> 47:39.708
<i>That woman...</i>

47:40.458 --> 47:42.666
She was supposed
to help me forget about you.

47:48.708 --> 47:49.750
But I couldn't.

47:49.750 --> 47:50.875
[Camille sighs]

47:52.000 --> 47:55.041
How can I believe you?
I saw everything in your room.

47:55.041 --> 47:58.500
The telescopes,
the model of the auction house.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.041
I saw your gun.

48:01.250 --> 48:03.041
And yet, here I am like a fool.

48:03.541 --> 48:06.125
And if you told me now
that you're not a thief...

48:07.083 --> 48:08.250
I think I'd believe you.

48:09.541 --> 48:11.583
I can't say it because it's not true.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.791
For a start, my name is Andrés.
Andrés de Fonollosa.

48:17.375 --> 48:19.666
Perfect!
- [Berlin] <i>I've told you too many lies.</i>

48:19.666 --> 48:22.125
But it's because I didn't have
any other choice.

48:22.125 --> 48:23.333
[sighs]

48:24.208 --> 48:25.416
[exhales]

48:29.791 --> 48:31.125
I didn't plan it,

48:32.458 --> 48:34.958
but while I was spying on your husband,
I fell in love with you.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.291
Hopelessly in love.

48:37.791 --> 48:39.250
Gotcha!

48:40.041 --> 48:42.708
That's 20 years at least. We've got ya.

48:42.708 --> 48:45.958
At night... you'd get up and read.

48:46.791 --> 48:48.458
With... an air of sadness.

48:48.458 --> 48:49.666
You'd dance

48:50.666 --> 48:53.041
and sing and devour the world
with your dog.

48:57.333 --> 49:01.416
And I wanted to be that dog,
attached to you for the rest of my life.

49:02.625 --> 49:05.916
But I couldn't just stop what I was doing.

49:06.416 --> 49:08.916
I couldn't just stop
and tell you the truth.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.500
And there was no way to stop the heist.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.333
[tender music building]

49:27.458 --> 49:29.333
No, I can't.

49:30.041 --> 49:31.625
I need to use the bathroom.

49:31.625 --> 49:33.208
It's that way.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.458
[tender music fades]

49:35.291 --> 49:36.750

50:00.000 --> 50:01.333
To hell with it!

50:03.708 --> 50:05.208
[both panting]

50:06.833 --> 50:08.583
Of course I can do it!

50:12.000 --> 50:14.166
[tender music swells]

50:22.875 --> 50:25.250
- [tender music fades slowly]
- [Camille panting]

50:35.458 --> 50:36.625
Let's get outta here.

50:43.750 --> 50:46.500
- [tense music playing]
- Hello, Inspector.

50:49.791 --> 50:51.166
- Ah.
- [Sierra chuckles]

50:51.166 --> 50:54.500
Deputy Inspectors. What brings you here?

50:54.500 --> 50:57.208
Well, who could refuse a trip to Paris?

50:57.208 --> 50:59.708
We're here for an update
on your investigation. Any news?

50:59.708 --> 51:00.750
I'll be quick.

51:01.625 --> 51:04.000
Forensics have analyzed and classified

51:04.000 --> 51:07.375
the DNA samples we got from the hotel
rooms and from the RV.

51:08.041 --> 51:12.625
All in all, they found
more than 2,580 different samples.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.875
It's as if the DNA
remains of every ethnicity

51:16.875 --> 51:20.666
from every continent in the world
is scattered across the crime scene.

51:20.666 --> 51:25.541
And of course, none of the samples match
with any known criminals we have on file.

51:26.208 --> 51:28.541
These sketches are all we have.

51:30.916 --> 51:33.541
Police sketches we put together
from multiple witnesses.

51:44.333 --> 51:46.666
Well, they may have gotten away
with it for now,

51:47.833 --> 51:49.708
but they'll pull another job.

51:49.708 --> 51:52.958
And the next time it happens,
we'll be ready.

51:52.958 --> 51:54.416
[doorbell rings]

51:55.458 --> 51:56.458
[Berlin sighs]

51:56.458 --> 51:58.541
There's something important
we need to discuss.

51:58.541 --> 52:00.916
No amount of money can compensate
for the pain

52:00.916 --> 52:02.250
and humiliation you've caused.

52:02.250 --> 52:06.250
Not to mention the collateral damage
of destroying my marriage.

52:06.250 --> 52:07.375
Here's my offer.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.791
In exchange for my silence, we want 40%.

52:10.791 --> 52:12.458
I have information about you

52:12.458 --> 52:15.083
that I'm sure will be of interest
to police around the world.

52:15.083 --> 52:17.666
And what exactly is this information?

52:24.708 --> 52:27.125
Naturally, as a professional,
you are aware

52:27.125 --> 52:28.375
that we've made copies.

52:29.583 --> 52:34.208
["Que me coma el tigre"

52:45.541 --> 52:47.666
- [sighs]
- [whimsical music playing]

52:49.125 --> 52:50.958
And here are the three other tapes.

52:50.958 --> 52:52.916
This is the one from your apartment,

52:52.916 --> 52:55.083
the one from the safe,
and the one from the glove box.

52:55.666 --> 52:57.708
All erased, naturally.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.375
And I mustn't forget

52:59.375 --> 53:02.208
this piece of evidence
you left in the bathroom.

53:02.208 --> 53:05.083
The Band-Aid with the mark
of a microphone cable.

53:06.208 --> 53:08.291
I also have something to say to you.

53:09.125 --> 53:10.541
You should thank me, Camille,

53:10.541 --> 53:12.583
for the collateral damages
you've talked about.

53:12.583 --> 53:16.125
I'm not the one who destroyed
your relationship with François.

53:16.625 --> 53:18.708
Your marriage was already a wreck
when I arrived.

53:18.708 --> 53:22.708
Let's just say he was a dance partner,
not your soulmate.

53:22.708 --> 53:25.416
Now, granted, he loved you
in a mediocre way.

53:25.416 --> 53:27.458
But he could never make you happy.

53:27.458 --> 53:31.208
I, on the other hand,
reminded you how happy you could be.

53:32.208 --> 53:33.250
And you, me.

53:33.250 --> 53:34.875
[gentle music playing]

53:34.875 --> 53:36.291
[Berlin] And you know what?

53:36.291 --> 53:39.916
Our relationship
isn't some trivial affair.

53:39.916 --> 53:40.833
It's real.

53:40.833 --> 53:42.166
It's real love.

53:42.666 --> 53:44.750
It's survived intact
these past few months,

53:44.750 --> 53:47.375
despite our separation, despite the risks

53:47.875 --> 53:49.291
and the distance

53:50.000 --> 53:51.333
and the pain.

53:52.583 --> 53:55.291
Yesterday, why couldn't we
restrain ourselves,

53:55.291 --> 53:57.750
even though, deep down,
I knew you were coming back

53:57.750 --> 53:58.916
to blackmail me?

53:59.416 --> 54:02.791
Because our love is true.
It is unstoppable.

54:02.791 --> 54:05.375
You can't ignore it,
no matter how hard you try.

54:05.375 --> 54:07.041
It's the elephant in the room.

54:07.041 --> 54:09.916
In fact,
an elephant in danger of extinction.

54:09.916 --> 54:14.333
Because most people will die
without ever knowing it.

54:15.041 --> 54:16.541
You tricked me.

54:17.791 --> 54:19.750
- You used me.
- [Berlin] No, Camille.

54:19.750 --> 54:24.125
I had nothing to gain from being with you.
In fact, I had everything to lose.

54:25.291 --> 54:30.250
And yet, I wouldn't hesitate
to risk it all to get to know you again.

54:32.458 --> 54:33.750
And another thing.

54:34.250 --> 54:36.333
Even though you
no longer have the evidence

54:36.333 --> 54:39.416
to blackmail me, I accept the extortion.

54:41.375 --> 54:45.958
But first, you have to bear in mind
that all the jewels and precious stones

54:45.958 --> 54:50.583
are currently being transformed
into new pieces in Turkey.

54:53.125 --> 54:56.208
You know,
we have to transform all this stuff

54:56.208 --> 54:59.541
because we can't really leave,
um, incriminating evidence.

54:59.541 --> 55:02.958
So what you see here
is the first payment from Ankara.

55:04.041 --> 55:06.875
3,800,000 euros.

55:07.750 --> 55:11.416
Of course, I'll send you the rest
of the money once I receive it, okay?

55:12.208 --> 55:14.458
- Works for you?
- Yeah.

55:16.625 --> 55:17.833
That works for me.
