WEBVTT

00:10.314 --> 00:13.709
[rap music playing,
lively chatter]

00:14.840 --> 00:16.016
Where's the jailbird at?!

00:17.408 --> 00:18.888
For real.
Where's my boy Trey at?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.673
Auntie Renee.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.111
It's been a minute, huh?

00:25.721 --> 00:27.157
Uh, brought a six-pack.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.203
It's kind of like
a welcome home gift for Trey.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.814
Ricky, I want to know why the
hell you're here at my party.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.817
Just wanted to chop it up
with my boy Trey.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.819
I been missing that fool
for years.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.169
Apparently not enough
to go visit that fool.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.780
None of his deadbeat-ass
friends did.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.089
Mm, so, uh, where is
the guest of honor?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.656
Trey's not here yet.
He's late.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.701
To his own welcome home party?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.008
See, that's the problem
with these so-called

00:52.052 --> 00:53.444
correctional facilities.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.185
They-they don't correct nothing.
[chuckles]

00:55.229 --> 00:56.882
He'll be here any minute.[line ringing]

00:58.884 --> 01:00.886
[line continues ringing]

01:02.975 --> 01:06.501
[phone ringing]

01:09.330 --> 01:11.332
â™ª

01:40.883 --> 01:43.015
Bishop is really
racking up the steps.

01:43.059 --> 01:45.453
I hope she remembered
her Fitbit.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.759
Look at that. She's
still picking up steam.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.022
Yeah, she's a phone pacer.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.764
You know, the better the call,
the faster she goes.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.464
Must be one hell of a call.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.987
You wore yourself out,
didn't you?

01:58.030 --> 02:00.076
Ah, a little bit,
but for good reason.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.644
I just got off the phone
with city council president

02:02.687 --> 02:03.862
of Hinton, Oklahoma.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.473
Your hometown?Yes, sir.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.650
And yours truly was chosen
to be grand marshal

02:08.693 --> 02:10.695
of their annual
Tater Tots Parade.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.828
Is that good news or something?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.743
Uh, yes. I used to
go to the Tater Tots

02:14.786 --> 02:16.048
every year growing up.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.964
I have dreamed of this
moment, and here we are.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.750
The Tater Tots Potatoes Queen.

02:21.793 --> 02:22.577
Mm.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.795
Mama, I made it.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.581
Okay, go ahead, make fun.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.888
But for a nerdy, scrawny girl
who grew up with no friends,

02:29.932 --> 02:31.673
this-- it's a big win.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.675
Do you know what
they used to call me?

02:33.718 --> 02:35.807
BOTH:
Scarecrow.

02:36.765 --> 02:37.722
You've mentioned it.

02:37.766 --> 02:38.897
Like, a few thousand times.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.726
From the scarecrow to the queen.

02:41.770 --> 02:44.164
Gear up, we got a body.Hmm.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.820
After you, Your Majesty.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.823
Mm.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.130
This was supposed to be

02:54.174 --> 02:57.002
the start of Trey's new life.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.352
Master Chief Quichera,
why don't you let

02:58.395 --> 02:59.831
someone else do this for you?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.833
I hung it up;
I'm taking it down.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.705
[grunting]

03:03.748 --> 03:05.315
I did everything I could

03:05.359 --> 03:07.926
to save this kid.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.841
Guess I didn't do enough.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.670
What was Trey
in prison for?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.846
This time?
Armed robbery.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.371
He and his boys
held up a Fast Mart.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.677
How long was he in for?

03:19.721 --> 03:21.636
The judge gave him 25 to life,

03:21.679 --> 03:24.552
but he only ended up
doing seven years.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.554
Really?
Yeah.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.730
Trey became a new man
in prison.

03:28.773 --> 03:31.776
He told me he didn't want
to go back to his old life.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.216
But I guess his old life
found him.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.219
I see your friend's murder
didn't affect your appetite.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.788
You guys know anyone who would
have wanted to harm Trey?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.184
Okay.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.447
Guess what we got here
is what they refer to

03:50.491 --> 03:52.623
on the streets
as the code of silence.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.451
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've heard of this.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.974
McGEE:
Yeah, they don't
want to cooperate,

03:56.018 --> 03:58.281
even if it means helping find
their friend's killer.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.763
And therefore, makes them look
like they're hiding something.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.461
I'm on probation.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.594
Then I suggest you stop
the tough guy routine

04:06.637 --> 04:07.682
and start talking.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.512
All I know is that...

04:11.555 --> 04:13.078
he must have been
into something.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.516
Because he was only
out of jail for a week,

04:15.559 --> 04:19.084
and somehow he was...
he was flush with cash.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.652
But you don't know
where that cash came from.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.177
Of course you don't.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.744
[camera clicking]

04:27.832 --> 04:29.747
Get a shot of his
left hand there.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.923
Defense wounds?

04:31.967 --> 04:36.363
No, he's got a strand
of hair in his palm.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.495
Hmm.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.845
Gonna bag this up, send it
back to Kasie for analysis.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.413
Count at least
four stab wounds, Gibbs.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.589
The victim bled
out quickly.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.722
Time of death?Based on lividity,

04:47.765 --> 04:50.986
I'd say anywhere from
seven to ten hours ago.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.379
Before the party started.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.728
Murder weapon.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.034
We've been searching the
courtyard; nothing yet.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.602
But there are steak knives
on the table over there.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.344
Yeah, but the knife that we're
looking for is not conventional.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.433
The wound pattern here
indicates a jagged,

05:03.477 --> 05:06.784
uneven blade with at
least one right angle.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.917
Like a shiv?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.098
What is that?
Melted plastic?

05:16.141 --> 05:17.752
Part of the homemade knife.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.669
Well, that is odd.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.845
People usually get shivved
while they're in prison.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.368
Not after they get out.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.327
Tell that to him.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.773
McGEE:
Kendall "Trey" Quichera.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.689
He only served seven years
of a 25-to-life sentence.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.691
According to his aunt,
he was practically a saint

05:43.734 --> 05:44.996
on the inside,
but I talked to

05:45.040 --> 05:46.824
two former inmates who said that

05:46.868 --> 05:48.391
he wasn't the angel
that she thought he was.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.612
He even started a brawl that
put him in the hole for a month.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.744
Brawl with who?Don't know.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.180
We're waiting on
the prison's internal records.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.226
They still
let this guy out early.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.662
On a technicality.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.838
An appellate court overturned
his original conviction

06:00.882 --> 06:03.101
based on mishandled evidence.Thank you.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.712
What's he done
since he's been out?

06:04.755 --> 06:06.017
A lot of boozing.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.889
Apparently, he was
approved for a credit card

06:07.932 --> 06:09.934
and has been running up a tab
over at O'Brien's Pub.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.588
You two, go.[phone ringing]

06:11.632 --> 06:14.199
McGee, Trey's original
drug case-- dig into it.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.158
Kase, yeah.
On my way down.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.159
[elevator bell dings]

06:17.202 --> 06:19.727
Just kind of... Hmm.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.424
Okay.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.165
And then-- Oh, son of a--

06:23.208 --> 06:25.123
Hey, Gibbs.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.342
Need some help?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.562
No, I think I got it.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.824
I wasn't asking, Kase.

06:29.867 --> 06:30.955
Oh.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.220
This is for a friend.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.527
He's got a job
interview today.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.833
He's freaking out
'cause he's like,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.661
"Oh, I don't know
how to tie a tie."

06:40.704 --> 06:42.750
I promised I'd hook him up,
but, like, tying a tie

06:42.793 --> 06:44.186
is ridiculously
complicated.

06:44.229 --> 06:47.581
It's like a Rubik's Cube
with all the fun sucked out.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.626
There you go.
You're all set.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.150
[gasps]
Oh, wow.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.935
Very nice, Gibbs.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.067
You know, if he makes this
bad boy look half as good as me,

06:56.111 --> 06:57.895
that job is his.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.376
Heh, heh, heh.
Look at me.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.552
Kase?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.728
You said you had something?Right. Sorry.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.383
So I tested the hair
you recovered

07:07.427 --> 07:08.863
from the victim's palm.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.865
Unfortunately,
it does not match our killer,

07:10.908 --> 07:13.563
unless we're looking for
a shiv-wielding pooch.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.869
Dog hair?
Yep.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.131
What breed?

07:16.174 --> 07:17.349
Still working on that.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.569
But based on the patterns
and dimensions

07:19.613 --> 07:22.354
of the victim's wounds,
I was able to create

07:22.398 --> 07:24.313
a rendering of
the murder weapon.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.141
Filed-down toothbrush.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.317
KASIE:
White-Bright, to be exact.
Although, you know, I doubt

07:28.360 --> 07:30.362
they're gonna want to use that
in their next ad campaign.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.326
Nice work.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.328
TORRES:
So, this grand marshal thing,

07:39.371 --> 07:40.721
do you get, like,
cash and prizes?

07:40.764 --> 07:43.898
No, but I do get to ride
in a Sebring convertible.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.290
And?

07:45.334 --> 07:46.727
And that's
pretty much it.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.728
Huh.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.338
What?

07:49.381 --> 07:52.080
No, I'm surprised.
I just...

07:52.123 --> 07:54.343
never thought of you
as someone who, uh, needed

07:54.386 --> 07:55.866
their ego stroked like that.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.825
I just need to beat her once.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.609
Beat who?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.393
Tanya Owens.

08:01.437 --> 08:04.745
I went to high school with
her, and she tormented me.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.529
She's a local meteorologist.

08:06.573 --> 08:10.011
She-She's Hinton's version
of a celebrity.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.100
Mm, such a sad little town.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.102
They usually ask Tanya
to be grand marshal,

08:14.145 --> 08:16.017
and I know how much
it means to her.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.845
So I can't wait
to see her face

08:17.888 --> 08:20.412
when she sees
Ellie the scarecrow

08:20.456 --> 08:22.284
rolling in that Sebring.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.721
Hey, you guys need some help?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.506
You have no idea, bro.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.423
Um, so we need to ask you about
a recent customer of yours.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.601
Kendall Quichera.
Also goes by Trey.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.559
Look familiar?

08:36.603 --> 08:37.865
Yeah. Whiskey neat, water back.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.083
He's been in
the last few nights.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.564
Alone?
[scoffs]
I wish.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.566
He always shows up
with the same dude,

08:43.610 --> 08:45.089
who is annoying as hell.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.874
Annoying how?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
He keeps handing out
his business cards.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.792
You don't happen to have
one of those cards, do you?

08:51.835 --> 08:53.533
One?

08:55.709 --> 08:56.971
Relentless.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.757
BISHOP:
"Dante Brown. Dog trainer,

09:00.801 --> 09:03.107
dog walker,
doggy day care."

09:03.151 --> 09:06.067
TORRES: Prior to Dante's
dog-walking ambitions,

09:06.110 --> 09:07.938
he built
quite a rap sheet.

09:07.982 --> 09:12.029
Felony agg-assault followed by
several probation violations.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.554
Turns out that Trey and Dante
had a lot more in common

09:14.597 --> 09:16.556
than knocking back
a few whiskeys.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.819
They were cellmates
at Danville Correctional.

09:18.862 --> 09:22.257
Having a drink with your old
celly doesn't make you a killer.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.781
We need more.Uh, boss?

09:25.956 --> 09:27.915
What do you got?I got more.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.873
Pulled the prison's
internal records,

09:29.917 --> 09:32.833
and one of Trey's prison
fights was with Dante Brown.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.617
Get this, Trey shivved him.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
BISHOP:
So that could
explain why Trey

09:36.314 --> 09:38.621
was killed with a shiv after
he was released from prison.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
Dante wanted payback.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.060
You got an address?I'll call his P.O.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.584
GIBBS:
Okay. Let's go.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.024
I mean, I love dogs.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.026
I don't have one
myself, but if I did,

09:52.069 --> 09:54.289
I wouldn't let this Dante guy
anywhere near mine.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.074
Your hypothetical dog's
lucky to have you, Nick.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.250
Hey, knock it off.
Bishop, Torres, take the back.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.600
McGee with me.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.992
Come on, Tater Tots, on my six.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.911
[dog barking]

10:09.826 --> 10:11.698
[laughs]

10:11.741 --> 10:13.482
Here you go.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.484
[laughs]

10:15.527 --> 10:17.355
You still love dogs?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.318
Federal agents!

10:23.361 --> 10:25.581
Nowhere to go, Dante!

10:26.756 --> 10:29.019
[dog continues barking]

10:29.063 --> 10:30.412
WOMAN:
Okay, we're coming out.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.631
"We"?

10:38.725 --> 10:39.900
Kasie?

10:39.943 --> 10:42.642
Don't shoot, Gibbs.
He's unarmed.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.830
[dog barking nearby]

11:00.747 --> 11:02.444
What's going on, Gibbs?

11:02.487 --> 11:04.751
Was about to ask you
the same thing.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.578
Dante a friend of yours?

11:06.622 --> 11:09.016
Best friend.
Known him my whole life.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.061
What do you think
he did?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.021
You don't actually think
he's the one

11:14.064 --> 11:15.849
who shivved that guy, do you?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.633
I never said that.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.591
The handcuffs
speak for themselves.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.028
[grunts]

11:21.071 --> 11:24.335
I'm just gonna have a talk,
ask him a few questions.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.728
Why him?

11:25.772 --> 11:29.384
GIBBS:
He was at a bar
with the victim last night.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.865
And the night
before that.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.737
Dante knew Trey Quichera?

11:34.781 --> 11:37.566
Well, they were cellmates.

11:37.609 --> 11:41.613
Until Trey attacked him
with a shiv.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.358
Dante never said anything about
getting jumped in prison.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.057
Hmm. He never mentioned Trey?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.493
No.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.017
Would you tell me if he did?

11:54.061 --> 11:56.759
Yes.

11:56.803 --> 12:01.198
Would it even matter at all if I
told you Dante is not your guy?

12:01.242 --> 12:03.418
Yes.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.072
Dante's not your guy.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.030
Yeah, I hope not.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.772
Still gonna need to have a chat.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.471
Can I be in the room?No.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.865
Then what can I do?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.258
Your job.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.351
That's, uh,
Dante's dog, right?

12:23.394 --> 12:26.267
Yeah, that's Theo. Why?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.139
You want me to collect
a sample of his hair?

12:29.183 --> 12:31.968
Gibbs, it's not Theo's hair that
we found at the crime scene.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.841
Then you got nothing to lose.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.761
[engine starts]

12:44.764 --> 12:46.504
DANTE:
What does Trey being

12:46.548 --> 12:48.985
laid out with a shiv
got to do with me?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.161
We all know about the fight
you two had in prison.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.424
We also know that Trey
used a shiv.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.730
[door opens]

12:54.774 --> 12:56.123
What are you talking about?

12:56.166 --> 12:57.994
A shiv?

12:58.038 --> 13:00.127
There wasn't ever any fight
between Trey and me.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.737
Hey.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.521
You okay, Kase?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.567
More worried about Dante.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.961
DANTE:
Trey had his share of
dustups in the yard,

13:08.004 --> 13:10.050
but he never came at me.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.834
We were boys.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.097
Prison records say different.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.534
Well, the prison records
are wrong.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.017
Wait a minute, that's the only
reason why I'm in here?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.627
'Cause of some fictional fight?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.760
No, it's not the only reason.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.111
Why were you and Trey out,
last couple of nights?

13:29.591 --> 13:31.071
DANTE:
Trey hit me up.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.334
He said he just
got sprung.

13:33.377 --> 13:36.076
This may seem silly
to y'all, but...

13:36.119 --> 13:38.643
the real world becomes scary.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.037
He just wanted to kick it
with somebody who can relate.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.299
You feel me?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.345
You two were close?

13:44.388 --> 13:47.261
No, not really.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.219
I still
considered him a friend.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.960
Friends still fight.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.354
Friends don't try
to kill each other.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.098
Are you charging me with murder?

13:58.141 --> 14:00.100
Not yet.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.972
Well, if I'm not under arrest,
then I'm free to go.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.365
I know my rights.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.280
Then you know
that you violated your parole

14:06.323 --> 14:09.022
by associating yourself
with a known felon.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.112
Really? Just for
having drinks with Trey?

14:14.636 --> 14:16.899
TORRES:
You might want to loosen
up that tie, buddy.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.162
Think you're gonna
be here a while.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.384
Really? A parole
violation?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.386
He's a murder suspect.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.171
They had to find
a reason to hold him.Why?

14:28.215 --> 14:31.261
He has no motive. He just told
them the fight didn't happen.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.263
Just trust
the process, Kasie.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.310
If he's innocent, they'll
cut him loose soon enough.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.835
He is a two-time felon from
the Hopson project in Bushwick.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.620
We both know
what that means.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.232
Innocent isn't always enough.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.104
But he's in good
hands here.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.801
We were supposed
to be on the way

14:49.845 --> 14:52.239
to his job interview right now.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.503
Ah. That explains the tie.
What job?

14:55.546 --> 14:57.722
Dog trainer
at Paw Palace.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.203
It's, uh, entry-level,
but they knew his past

15:00.247 --> 15:02.727
and were still willing
to give him a shot.

15:02.771 --> 15:07.036
I was really hoping this job
was gonna change his life.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.997
KASIE:
Hey, where's Gibbs?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.304
Hey. I was just about
to come down...

15:14.348 --> 15:16.306
Dante just said the fight
with Trey never happened.

15:16.350 --> 15:19.396
Yeah, Kasie, I know.
I was in there.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.398
No. No, right after
you guys left,

15:21.442 --> 15:22.965
he told me, and he has never

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
lied to me ever.
He's telling the truth.

15:25.011 --> 15:28.318
And that means the fight,
aka his motive, it isn't real.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.624
And you may be right, Kase,

15:29.667 --> 15:32.366
but we can't just
take his word for it.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.107
Right, no, of course not.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.936
Please, just investigate.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.285
We are.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.982
Then why aren't you
on your way to the prison

15:40.026 --> 15:41.418
to find out
what really happened?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.203
Because Gibbs and McGee
didn't invite us.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.814
It's not really
a four-person gig, Kasie.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.208
BISHOP:
Look, we are gonna
do everything we can

15:48.251 --> 15:50.732
to get to the truth.
No assumptions.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.386
You trust us, right?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.518
Of course. Yeah, no.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.390
I just, um,

15:56.433 --> 16:00.394
you know, Dante has been wronged
by the system so many times.

16:00.437 --> 16:03.049
I mean, he's spent
most of his adult life in prison

16:03.092 --> 16:04.615
for nothing.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.008
For nothing?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.054
Really, Kasie?

16:09.359 --> 16:11.840
2008, reckless
endangerment.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.234
2009, possession
of contraband.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.280
2012, criminal
trespassing.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.760
Every single one
of those things

16:18.803 --> 16:21.110
was a ticky-tack
probation violation.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.069
Like, the contraband?

16:23.112 --> 16:24.244
That was a few fireworks.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.333
But because he was
already on probation,

16:26.376 --> 16:28.291
he served two years.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.685
And the reckless endangerment?
He and his girlfriend,

16:30.728 --> 16:32.774
they were on his Ducati,
she begged him to pop a wheelie,

16:32.817 --> 16:34.471
so he did.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.864
A cop saw him.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.867
He went back to prison
for popping a wheelie?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.261
Nine more months.TORRES: What about
his first arrest?

16:41.304 --> 16:44.090
The felony aggravated assault
in 2005?

16:46.527 --> 16:50.357
You know, Kasie, I'm not
trying to be a jerk,

16:50.400 --> 16:54.143
but the report says he almost
killed a kid at a party.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.145
I know.

16:56.189 --> 16:59.148
I know what the report says.

16:59.192 --> 17:02.021
But I also know the truth.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.283
A troubled 15-year-old boy

17:03.326 --> 17:06.808
got jumped
by a rival gang at a party

17:06.851 --> 17:10.551
and Dante was the only person
that tried to help.

17:10.594 --> 17:14.250
But all the cops saw was a bunch
of thugs beating on a kid.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.209
You were there?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.341
No.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.996
But, you know,
I really wish I would've been.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.216
'Cause that kid that Dante
risked his life to save,

17:23.259 --> 17:25.348
that's my baby brother.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.395
Nobody had Dante's back
at trial?

17:28.438 --> 17:31.180
All the witnesses
were too afraid to testify,

17:31.224 --> 17:35.228
so all the jury had
was the police report.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.233
Dante got six years.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.889
3,000 inmates, 150 guards.
You do the math.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.456
You give them an inch,
they'll take a mile,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.110
so I don't give them that inch.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.894
Doesn't stop them from
trying to take it.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.114
Yes, sir. Trey Quichera tried.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.942
Was always pushing the limits.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.770
I guess he finally pushed
someone too far.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.468
What about Dante Brown?I couldn't tell you.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.254
Hmm, never said two words to him
the whole time he was here.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.864
He'd rather talk to his dog.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.824
Inmates are allowed dogs?

18:06.868 --> 18:09.914
Not exactly. They just work
with them during the day.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.482
It's part of
our K-9s For Cons program.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.789
They bring in
at-risk rescue dogs

18:14.832 --> 18:16.965
so the inmates can
rehabilitate them.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.923
Seems weird putting together
two lost causes,

18:18.967 --> 18:21.883
but somehow,
it all seems to work.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.580
Ain't that right, Sarge?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.539
Already placed 37
dogs in good homes.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.977
Before they came to us, all
these dogs were unadoptable.

18:29.020 --> 18:29.934
And just look
at them now.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.154
[barking]

18:32.198 --> 18:34.156
You work with Dante Brown?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.898
Every day.
Best damn trainer I ever had.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.726
Keeping his
nose clean?

18:38.769 --> 18:40.771
He's a suspect in Trey's murder.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.556
Really?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.558
I mean, I heard
about Trey.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.777
Tell you the truth,
that punk had it coming.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.518
But Dante?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.303
I didn't think he had it in him.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.174
Well, he had at least one fight.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.829
With Trey, here in the yard.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
I don't remember that.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.658
Neither do I.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.008
I've got the report
right here.

19:00.051 --> 19:03.011
Last July,
Trey shivved Dante.

19:03.054 --> 19:06.188
Well, if it's in the report,
it happened.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.018
Officer Brindle,
you recognize this?

19:10.061 --> 19:11.150
That is your signature.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.935
I fill out
a fight report every day.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.893
Shivs, shanks, switchblades.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.417
[chuckles]:
All becomes a blur.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.202
Your surveillance video--
how far back do you keep it?

19:20.246 --> 19:21.943
Five years.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.988
You want to see
the fight for yourself.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
You got it. Just
need the date.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.470
Well, that's the problem.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.037
See, the report shows

19:29.080 --> 19:31.996
the month and year
of the fight, but not the day.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.086
I don't know
what happened there, Sarge.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.482
Okay. We'll be in touch.

19:41.092 --> 19:44.966
That's, uh, 31 days
we need to scan, McGee.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.577
And by "we,"
you mean "me," right?

19:47.621 --> 19:49.188
[chuckles]

19:49.231 --> 19:51.538
Okay, so what's the plan?Plan?

19:51.581 --> 19:53.844
Yeah, you saw how this dog
tried to maul Torres earlier.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.498
We need a plan.
[gasps]

19:55.542 --> 19:56.934
Wait, should we be
wearing one of those

19:56.978 --> 19:58.980
big puffy bite-proof suits?

19:59.023 --> 20:01.200
Oh, yeah. Probably.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.505
I'm kidding, Bishop.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.507
Oh, my God.I'm kidding.
[laughs]

20:04.551 --> 20:07.031
[barking]Hey! Hey, Theo. Hi.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.990
Hi. Yes.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.297
Oh, I love you, too, Theo-man.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.560
Wow. He likes you
a lot more than Torres.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
KASIE:
Uh, yeah, he better.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.608
Fostered this guy right
after he got out of prison.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.741
Wait, puppy prison?Oh, yeah.

20:20.784 --> 20:24.614
Theo was one of the at-risk dogs
in their prison-inmate program.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.007
Theo was Dante's,

20:26.050 --> 20:29.489
but Theo graduated
before Dante got paroled.

20:29.532 --> 20:33.057
So he was your roommate until
Dante got out? For how long?

20:33.101 --> 20:34.755
A month.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.410
A month? In your tiny
little studio apartment?

20:37.453 --> 20:38.759
How was that?

20:38.802 --> 20:40.369
[food clatters in bowl]

20:40.413 --> 20:41.675
Intimate.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.939
[toy squeaking, Bishop laughs]

20:44.982 --> 20:46.549
Oh, hey, sorry about that.Yes.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.160
Theo's never really grasped
the concept of personal space.

20:49.204 --> 20:52.512
[laughs] That's okay.
I'm not complaining. Okay.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.731
[Theo barking]Hey.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.081
â™ª

21:01.608 --> 21:03.000
[Bishop chuckles]

21:03.044 --> 21:04.219
[Theo barks]

21:04.263 --> 21:05.394
Boy.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.397
[Bishop grunting playfully]

21:08.441 --> 21:10.051
Hey, you all good over there?

21:10.094 --> 21:10.965
Kase?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.447
You good?
Yeah.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.623
We're good.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.277
Great.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.591
[elevator bell dings]

21:32.073 --> 21:34.118
GIBBS:
Kasie.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.816
Hey.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.121
You called?

21:37.165 --> 21:39.515
I just tested Theo's hair.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.735
It was not a match
to the dog hair

21:41.778 --> 21:43.040
we recovered from the victim.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.477
And you're sure?

21:44.520 --> 21:45.739
100%.

21:45.782 --> 21:48.829
Isn't that supposed to be
good news?

21:48.872 --> 21:52.789
Yeah, it is, but this isn't.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.706
I found it in
Dante's backyard.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.752
It was hidden under
Theo's bed.

21:58.795 --> 21:59.927
A shiv.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.059
Made from
a White-Bright toothbrush.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.236
And so you were gonna
tell us this when?

22:05.280 --> 22:07.282
I'm sorry I hid it
from you, Ellie.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.936
I was afraid
I wouldn't be allowed

22:08.979 --> 22:10.372
to test the blood myself,

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
and if Dante was going away
for murder,

22:12.418 --> 22:15.159
I wanted to make sure
the test was done right.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.639
And?

22:16.683 --> 22:18.249
Tested the blood three times,

22:18.293 --> 22:20.034
and this is
the murder weapon.

22:20.077 --> 22:23.994
I'm sorry, Kase.
I know this has got to be tough.

22:24.038 --> 22:27.041
Yeah, it sucks.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.043
I really thought this
was his fresh start.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.872
Really believed
he wasn't going back.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.918
Can I have a minute
to say goodbye, Gibbs?

22:52.109 --> 22:54.111
[sighs] Thank God, Kasie.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.983
How long they planning on
keeping me in here?

22:56.026 --> 22:57.071
Sit.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.421
What? What now?

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
Look, I said sit.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.650
Look familiar?

23:10.693 --> 23:12.173
No.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.001
Is that...?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.481
Yeah.

23:15.524 --> 23:20.486
Kasie, I've never
seen this before in my life.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.967
Then why was it
in your backyard?

23:24.011 --> 23:25.404
I don't know.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.319
No, you got to do
better than that.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.191
Maybe somebody planted it there?

23:30.234 --> 23:32.193
Well, planted by who?

23:32.236 --> 23:34.935
The hell if I know.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.894
I would start by asking
whoever found the damn thing.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.940
I found it.

23:41.245 --> 23:45.511
So like I said, you're
gonna have to do better.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.730
Okay, hold up, hold up.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.385
You don't actually believe
that I murdered Trey, do you?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.909
No.[sighs]

23:52.953 --> 23:55.521
But everyone else does.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.437
So if you ever want to see
Theo again, you're gonna need

23:58.480 --> 24:00.264
to help me help you.

24:02.266 --> 24:05.226
Didn't Kasie just ask you
if she could say goodbye?

24:05.269 --> 24:08.272
Goodbyes come in many forms.

24:08.316 --> 24:11.188
She still doesn't think
he's guilty.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.628
Ah, and you knew it.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.152
The thought did cross my mind.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.415
But you also knew
if he was honest with anyone,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.112
it would be her,

24:22.156 --> 24:23.113
and you wanted
a confession.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.899
No. I wanted the truth.

24:25.942 --> 24:28.423
You're not convinced
he's guilty either. Why?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.121
He had motive, the
shiv was at his house.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.645
Uh, Theo's house.

24:32.688 --> 24:33.950
What are you saying?

24:33.994 --> 24:35.648
We should be interrogating
a German shepherd?

24:35.691 --> 24:38.259
What I'm saying is he could've
ditched it in a lake.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.130
He didn't do that.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.481
He hid it with his dog,
which is not only dumb,

24:42.524 --> 24:44.874
it's dangerous,
if you love your dog.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.702
Mm.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.748
Maybe Dante got desperate.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.533
Yeah, maybe.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.709
Man, you remember
when we first met?

24:53.753 --> 24:55.842
[chuckles softly]

24:55.885 --> 24:59.498
Uh... yeah.
Fifth grade, recess.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.282
Mm-hmm.I was chilling
on the stairs

25:01.325 --> 25:04.154
and you walked right up
and spit your game.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.504
Spit my game?

25:05.547 --> 25:08.419
You were crushing on me
a little bit.
Wrong.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.944
No. You needed my help, okay?

25:10.987 --> 25:12.380
'Cause the McCallen brothers

25:12.423 --> 25:15.296
were chucking Nerf footballs
at your dome.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.821
That's funny. Thought you were
kind of feeling me back then.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.171
No, far from
it, bro. No.

25:21.215 --> 25:24.261
You just needed a friend
'cause, face it,

25:24.305 --> 25:25.959
you had more than
enough enemies.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.352
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.617
What is this? Is this some
kind of pre-prison pep talk?

25:31.660 --> 25:33.967
'Cause if it is, it sucks.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.317
This is a "save your ass"
pep talk.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.407
What's this for?

25:39.450 --> 25:42.279
Hey, you're still the same kid
that I saved at recess.

25:42.323 --> 25:45.021
We both know that you got a real
talent for pissing people off,

25:45.065 --> 25:48.198
so I want you to make a list
of all of them.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.679
You think the McCallens
set me up for Trey's murder?

25:50.723 --> 25:53.290
No.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.118
But I think somebody did.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.295
Come on, give me
some damn names, Dante.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.607
You wouldn't believe
how many fights break out

26:05.651 --> 26:06.826
in prison every day.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.176
Actually, I would.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.917
Gibbs has me listening
to inmate phone calls

26:10.960 --> 26:13.006
to see if there's any talk
about Dante's fight,

26:13.049 --> 26:14.355
and I just started,
and I've heard

26:14.398 --> 26:15.878
about a dozen
different beatdowns.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.402
Dante vs. Trey?Eh, nothing yet.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.969
[Torres chuckles]

26:21.623 --> 26:23.756
What are you smiling at, Torres?

26:23.799 --> 26:26.019
Hmm? Oh, the, uh,

26:26.062 --> 26:27.542
the weather forecast.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.023
In the Sooner State.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.938
Right now, we're seeing some
pretty clear conditions...

26:31.981 --> 26:33.026
[TV muted]

26:33.069 --> 26:34.418
Oh, you think
this is funny?

26:34.462 --> 26:36.769
[laughs]:
Extremely.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.379
Come on, you kept
bringing her up,

26:38.422 --> 26:40.947
so naturally, I got curious.

26:40.990 --> 26:41.991
Who is that?

26:42.035 --> 26:44.211
TORRES:
That's Tanya Owens, aka

26:44.254 --> 26:47.170
Bishop's long-time archnemesis.

26:47.214 --> 26:50.739
Aka the meanest meteorologist
in the world.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.654
[TV muted]

26:52.698 --> 26:54.134
She's pretty good.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.918
There's no sound, McGee.

26:55.962 --> 26:56.963
[laughs]

26:58.268 --> 26:59.792
What's going on?

26:59.835 --> 27:01.402
Oh, you know, the usual.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.013
Tormenting Bishop.Mm.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.580
Did you get a chance
to look into

27:05.624 --> 27:06.886
all those names
Dante gave us?

27:08.539 --> 27:11.020
Yes, yes. We cleared
most of the list.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.674
They all had alibis.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.197
What about the rest?

27:14.241 --> 27:15.938
We're checking them out now.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.506
Really? 'Cause it looks to me
like all you're checking out

27:18.549 --> 27:21.117
is the Doppler radar
for central Oklahoma.

27:22.553 --> 27:25.818
Okay, listen, Kasie,
we know he's your friend,

27:25.861 --> 27:27.994
but look at
the evidence.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.691
I'm pretty sure we have our guy.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.916
Yeah, well, I am pretty sure
that we just sent

27:36.959 --> 27:39.179
an innocent man
back to prison,

27:39.222 --> 27:41.094
and you all
don't even seem to care.

27:41.137 --> 27:44.097
Hey, come on, Kase.
You don't actually believe that.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.055
Which part, Eleanor?

27:47.100 --> 27:48.667
Miss Hines.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.278
My office, please.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.944
[knock on door]

28:04.987 --> 28:06.859
What exactly
were you hoping

28:06.902 --> 28:08.817
to accomplish
with that down there?

28:08.861 --> 28:10.645
I'm sorry, Director.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.995
I apologized to the team
right after you left.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.301
Not what I asked.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.564
First and foremost,
you're a forensic scientist.

28:16.607 --> 28:20.046
Our job is to investigate,
evaluate the evidence,

28:20.089 --> 28:21.438
and make good arrests.

28:21.482 --> 28:24.137
I know that.And being Kasie Hines's
best friend

28:24.180 --> 28:26.922
is not an automatic
"get out of jail free" card.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.619
I know that, too, sir.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.230
So despite
all the evidence,

28:30.273 --> 28:33.189
including the murder weapon,
which you found at the house,

28:33.233 --> 28:35.757
you still believe that
Dante Brown is innocent?

28:35.801 --> 28:39.021
Yes, sir. I do.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.937
Dante isn't a killer.
He's not capable of it.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.113
Okay, then.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.811
I'm sorry
I interrupted.

28:45.854 --> 28:48.422
You can go back down.
Continue as before.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.902
Say again?

28:49.945 --> 28:53.035
Why do you think I called you
up here, Miss Hines?

28:53.079 --> 28:55.908
To tell me
to back off.
Wrong.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.780
I called you up here to tell you
that you're not alone.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.217
The anger
you're feeling now,

29:01.261 --> 29:03.785
yeah, I have felt it, too.

29:03.829 --> 29:07.267
Your instinct to fight for
your friend should be commended.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.922
If you truly believe
that Dante Brown is innocent,

29:09.965 --> 29:11.924
then you better fight like hell
to prove it.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.534
And if that means
lighting a fire

29:13.577 --> 29:14.927
under every ass
in this place,

29:14.970 --> 29:16.232
then so be it.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.278
You have my full support.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.020
Thank you, Director.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.935
But you better be right.

29:22.978 --> 29:27.113
Love and loyalty can be
blinding, Miss Hines.

29:27.156 --> 29:30.943
If we're not careful, we go
to war for the wrong people.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.683
And trust me,

29:32.727 --> 29:35.469
that's one lesson that you don't
want to learn the hard way.

29:35.512 --> 29:39.560
Now, that being said,
I'm gonna ask you one more time:

29:39.603 --> 29:43.303
Are you 100% sure
that Dante Brown is innocent?

29:44.957 --> 29:46.132
Don't answer that.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.264
Kasie, I'm sorry,
but there's, uh,

29:48.308 --> 29:49.788
something you
need to see.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.010
[door buzzes,
men shouting in distance]

30:02.931 --> 30:04.585
You don't look happy.

30:04.628 --> 30:08.023
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

30:11.940 --> 30:14.551
Doesn't matter. It's not like
I would believe you anyway.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.957
That doesn't make me a killer.

30:29.001 --> 30:32.004
No, but it does make you a liar.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.878
What else have you lied about?

30:45.017 --> 30:46.148
[door buzzes in distance]

30:46.192 --> 30:48.672
I'm sorry, Kasie.

30:48.716 --> 30:51.197
Why did you lie to me?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.113
If NCIS knew that
Trey really did attack me,

30:54.156 --> 30:55.810
I'd look guilty as hell.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.421
Not as guilty
as you do now.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.597
Thought it'd be my word
against the guard's.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.208
How could you not
know every prison

31:02.251 --> 31:04.253
has a surveillance
system?

31:04.297 --> 31:07.082
I thought that Trey attacked me

31:07.126 --> 31:09.519
in a spot that was
outside the camera view.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.565
Yeah, maybe you should
stop thinking.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.089
I get it, I screwed up.

31:14.133 --> 31:17.701
Again. We've been here before.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.009
When's this gonna stop, Dante?

31:21.053 --> 31:23.925
I risked my job to protect you.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.535
Does that even matter to you?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.886
Of course it does.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.150
But you know what
I've been through with cops.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.239
And they pulled me
out of my house at gunpoint,

31:33.282 --> 31:34.893
so, yeah, I was scared.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.286
But you didn't just lie to them,
you lied to me.

31:37.330 --> 31:40.072
You are them, Kasie!

31:40.115 --> 31:42.901
You are them.

31:44.990 --> 31:48.167
I'm your friend first.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.908
So you can trust me.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.693
Kasie, I regret

31:52.736 --> 31:57.306
lying to you more than
I resent sitting in this chair.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.005
I know that I hurt you,
and it sucks,

32:00.048 --> 32:03.138
because nobody matters to me
more than you do.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.488
Kasie, you know the real me.

32:05.532 --> 32:09.666
Oh, man, I don't, I don't
know if that's true anymore.

32:09.710 --> 32:13.453
You know damn well
I ain't no killer.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.237
Please don't let
one mistake

32:15.281 --> 32:18.284
just erase 25 years
of friendship.

32:21.287 --> 32:24.203
What do you want from me, Dante?

32:24.246 --> 32:26.814
Just a little faith.

32:26.857 --> 32:31.123
'Cause you and I both know
that without your help,

32:31.166 --> 32:35.214
I'm gonna rot in here
for the rest of my life.

32:35.257 --> 32:40.132
NCIS cleared the
names you gave me.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.308
Okay? So...

32:42.351 --> 32:45.267
nobody on that
list framed you.

32:45.311 --> 32:49.315
Which means that we are...
we're all out of leads.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.840
So you giving up on me?

32:52.883 --> 32:55.190
No.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.716
I'll never give up
on you, Dante.

33:01.588 --> 33:04.373
And I'll never stop loving you.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.204
But I got to go 'cause, um,

33:09.248 --> 33:12.338
Theo's all alone.

33:12.381 --> 33:15.167
[crying]: Can you tell my boy
I love him?

33:15.210 --> 33:18.431
Yeah, I will, and, um...

33:18.474 --> 33:20.172
he knows.

33:21.869 --> 33:26.178
Thank you for taking care
of him... again.

33:30.269 --> 33:34.055
Yeah, we're-we're taking
care of each other.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.237
[crying softly]

33:45.240 --> 33:47.895
What are we doing, McGee?What do you mean?

33:47.938 --> 33:49.636
TORRES:
We found the guy.
We made the arrest.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.159
Why are we still looking
in this case?

33:51.203 --> 33:52.900
Uh, you'd have to ask Gibbs.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.380
Ask Gibbs what?

33:54.423 --> 33:56.208
Well, McGee wants to know

33:56.251 --> 33:59.037
why we're still looking
into the, uh, Quichera case?

34:01.343 --> 34:03.693
Look, are you afraid
that we got it wrong?

34:03.737 --> 34:06.348
Or are we just triple-checking
because it's Kasie?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.351
Both. Update.

34:09.395 --> 34:12.180
All right, well,
I re-interviewed Trey's buddies.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.660
Same stories as before.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.096
I don't think
they're hiding anything.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.880
McGee, go.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.361
Found a couple scuffles Trey had
that we didn't know about,

34:19.405 --> 34:21.276
but the guys he fought
are still locked up.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.366
TORRES:
Gibbs, I'm all up for
crossing T's and dotting I's.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.368
I feel bad for Kasie,

34:26.412 --> 34:28.501
what she's going
through right now,

34:28.544 --> 34:30.590
but I'm pretty sure
we got the right guy.

34:30.633 --> 34:33.332
I'm not. Gibbs.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.768
You need to hear this.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.954
[phone ringing]

34:46.997 --> 34:48.216
Hey, Bishop.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.958
You were right.
Dante didn't kill Trey.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.351
Then who did?

34:52.394 --> 34:54.396
Someone who was trying
to keep Trey from talking.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.615
About what?

34:55.658 --> 34:57.921
Well, he was laundering money
on the inside

34:57.965 --> 34:59.923
with some inmate
named Grant.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.143
And so we think this Grant guy
ordered the hit.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.492
Wait, how do you know all this?

35:03.536 --> 35:05.190
Gibbs has had me
listening

35:05.233 --> 35:07.366
to the prison phone calls
for days, so...

35:07.409 --> 35:08.367
He has?

35:08.410 --> 35:10.020
Yeah, look, talk to Dante,

35:10.064 --> 35:12.458
find out if the name "Grant"
means anything to him.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.112
Yeah, on it.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.984
Oh, and, Bishop, thank you.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.075
[dogs barking in distance]

35:24.557 --> 35:26.559
[barking continues]

35:31.129 --> 35:32.260
BISHOP:
I can't believe
there are

35:32.304 --> 35:34.480
13 guys named Grant
in the same prison.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.482
So many Grants,
so little time.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.266
At least he's not a Smith.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.442
BISHOP:
Well, we can
cross both Greg Grant

35:40.486 --> 35:43.097
and Alden Grant
off the list because

35:43.141 --> 35:45.317
they spent the last decade
in solitary.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.188
Louis Grant
is out, too.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.321
He was only processed in
a few weeks ago.

35:49.364 --> 35:52.193
Well, then that's a wrap.
We're all out of Grants.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.281
Check the employees.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.457
Already did.
Didn't find anything.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.458
What about vendors?

35:56.502 --> 35:58.460
[typing]Um...

35:58.504 --> 36:00.070
Yeah, there is one Grant.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.681
Noel Grant.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.292
Contracted to handle
all of the prison's...

36:04.336 --> 36:06.164
Laundry.Yeah.

36:06.207 --> 36:07.469
Yeah, he runs
a commercial service

36:07.513 --> 36:09.384
called Press 'N Clean Pros.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.256
H-How do you,
how do you know that, Gibbs?

36:11.299 --> 36:14.389
The guy on the call
didn't say "laundering,"

36:14.433 --> 36:16.086
he said "laundry."TORRES: Wait.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.654
Trey did work in the prison's
laundry detail for years.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.395
Who is Noel Grant?

36:20.439 --> 36:22.310
Uh...

36:22.354 --> 36:24.007
Someone with
a pretty sketchy past.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.358
He was indicted for
narcotics trafficking

36:26.401 --> 36:27.446
three times.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.187
Yeah, and just last month,

36:29.230 --> 36:32.059
he bought a $5.2 million
beach home in Aruba.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.495
TORRES:
Didn't they say

36:33.539 --> 36:36.194
the hit was ordered
by someone inside the prison?

36:36.237 --> 36:38.239
Must be someone else involved.[phone ringing]

36:38.283 --> 36:39.414
Another inmate?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.808
Yeah.
On my way down.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.987
What do you got, Kase?

36:47.030 --> 36:48.989
Dog hair, lots of it.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.426
After Bishop told me
the hit was ordered by someone

36:51.470 --> 36:53.428
inside of the prison,
I had a hunch,

36:53.472 --> 36:55.125
so I collected hair

36:55.169 --> 36:57.432
from all the
K-9s For Cons dogs,

36:57.476 --> 36:59.826
and tested it against the hair
found at the crime scene.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.611
And this guy was a match.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.134
How's that possible?

37:04.178 --> 37:06.224
I thought the dogs were
kenneled at the prison?

37:06.267 --> 37:07.834
The dogs assigned
to the inmates are,

37:07.877 --> 37:10.663
but the dogs the staff use
to teach the class

37:10.706 --> 37:13.709
go home with them,
and this particular pooch

37:13.753 --> 37:16.495
belongs to a guard.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.497
Which one?

37:20.803 --> 37:22.544
Why am I here?

37:24.546 --> 37:27.419
Because killing people
is illegal.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.682
[chuckles]:
Who do you think I killed?

37:29.725 --> 37:31.379
Trey Quichera.

37:31.423 --> 37:32.815
That's ridiculous.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.340
Trey was a career criminal,
a gangbanger.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.516
Probably got killed
by some thug.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.518
Like Dante Brown?

37:39.561 --> 37:41.520
You said yourself they had beef.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.565
Those fights in the yard
ain't just nothing.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.393
Them boys,
they kill each other.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.961
Which is why you chose Dante
to be your fall guy.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.397
He had a motive.

37:49.441 --> 37:52.139
Why the hell would I want
to kill Trey Quichera?

37:52.182 --> 37:54.576
To shut him up.About what?

37:54.620 --> 37:55.969
All the drugs
you've been smuggling

37:56.012 --> 37:57.710
into the prison over the years.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.451
You and Noel Grant

37:59.494 --> 38:02.584
cut a deal, use his linen trucks
to bring in coke

38:02.628 --> 38:04.456
and heroin,
bypassing security.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.327
And you still needed
an inmate on the inside

38:06.371 --> 38:07.807
to move your product.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.462
You handpicked Trey because
he was doing 25 to life,

38:10.505 --> 38:12.464
but he had an
early release.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.248
You panicked,
thought he might talk.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.163
So you killed him
with a prison shiv

38:16.206 --> 38:18.208
and you planted that
in Dante's backyard.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.650
You can't prove any of this.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.129
Oh, Noel Grant can.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.654
Our agents grabbed him at
Dulles before he could hop

38:28.697 --> 38:30.656
on a flight to Aruba.

38:30.699 --> 38:33.267
He's been airing out
your dirty laundry ever since.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.834
[chuckles] Literally.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.836
Look on the bright side,
at least you're

38:36.879 --> 38:39.491
going somewhere familiar and
you know all the rules already.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.884
[chuckling]:
I bet them boys in Danville

38:41.928 --> 38:44.757
are gonna be excited to see you.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.241
Yo. What are you
doing here?

38:51.285 --> 38:52.808
Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane

38:52.852 --> 38:55.811
on your way to do
the grand marshaling thingy?

38:55.855 --> 38:57.596
Nah. I decided not to go.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.424
Seriously?

38:59.467 --> 39:02.122
What about little baby Bishop
inside your soul?

39:02.165 --> 39:03.906
Isn't she gonna be
disappointed?

39:03.950 --> 39:05.343
She'll get over it.

39:05.386 --> 39:08.520
And all your faithful minions
in Tater-Tots-ville?

39:08.563 --> 39:09.912
Don't you owe it to...

39:09.956 --> 39:11.566
Okay, they didn't want me, okay?

39:11.610 --> 39:13.176
The truth is
they never really wanted me,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.700
so can we just drop it?

39:14.743 --> 39:17.790
Already dropped.Thank you.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.925
They want Tanya Owens instead.
Uh-huh. Can you believe that?

39:22.969 --> 39:25.406
Tanya frickin' Owens, again.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.929
They only asked me
because Tanya

39:26.973 --> 39:28.757
wasn't available,
then all of a sudden,

39:28.801 --> 39:32.195
her schedule just
cleared right up. Mm-hmm.

39:32.239 --> 39:33.501
Wait, so they just
uninvited you?

39:33.545 --> 39:35.373
Oh, no, it's even worse.
They asked me

39:35.416 --> 39:39.202
to be the head of security
for Grand Marshal Tanya.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.508
Mm-hmm.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.467
It's okay. Go ahead.
You can laugh.

39:42.510 --> 39:45.992
Bishop, I would
never laugh at you.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.603
Right in front of your face.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.692
Ha.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.390
You want to get some sushi?

39:52.433 --> 39:55.915
Oh, I'd-I'd love to,
but I already have plans.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.004
Oh, really? You got a hot date?

39:58.047 --> 39:59.701
Something like that.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.486
Really?
I was kidding.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.575
I didn't, I didn't know
you were seeing anyone.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.925
It's just been
a few weeks.
Wow, that's like

40:05.968 --> 40:08.928
six months
in Torres years.
[chuckles]

40:08.971 --> 40:11.626
You would like her, Bishop.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.673
She's older, mature.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.501
I think it may be good for me.

40:20.330 --> 40:21.810
Wow.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.683
How much older?

40:24.726 --> 40:27.468
Does it matter?

40:27.512 --> 40:28.991
No.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.689
[elevator bell dings]

40:32.517 --> 40:35.476
You know, you two
make quite the couple.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.174
You know, I can't thank
everybody from NCIS enough.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.481
You guys
saved my ass.

40:40.525 --> 40:43.049
Oh, well, you know,
you were innocent.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.443
No, that don't matter.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.228
Like, I still violated
my parole.

40:48.271 --> 40:50.752
I was right back
in the teeth of the system.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.624
Thank you, Kase.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.974
Don't thank me.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.063
It was Gibbs and Vance
that got you released.

40:57.106 --> 40:58.586
They took up
your cause,

40:58.630 --> 41:01.023
went to war
with the D.O.J.

41:01.067 --> 41:05.027
And a week later,
here I am, free to annoy

41:05.071 --> 41:06.899
the hell out of
my dog-son.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.858
I'm sorry you went
through this, D.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.165
I'm lucky to have
a best friend at NCIS.

41:12.208 --> 41:14.689
No, I'd still be
locked up.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.517
You know, there's
a ton of guys in there

41:16.561 --> 41:18.519
who have an honest
story to tell,
