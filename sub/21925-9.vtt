14:00.339 --> 14:04.260
My Lord. It's the  U.S.S. Discovery.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.304
They've appeared in orbit around Pahvo.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.223
Their weapons are online.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.726
So...

14:13.269 --> 14:17.815
Starfleet sends their most prized,
enchanted vessel to defend the planet...

14:18.399 --> 14:19.400
alone.

14:20.901 --> 14:24.280
The humans are fools.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.492
Prepare to drop cloak and fire.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.330
We will storm her decks...

14:33.789 --> 14:35.583
execute her crew...

14:36.166 --> 14:41.714
and take her storied weapon for our own.

14:42.131 --> 14:47.887
We will destroy this hideous planet Pahvo
and its transmitter.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.640
This war will be ours!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.544
Sharper! Anticipate her moves!

21:49.391 --> 21:50.892
What is it doing?
