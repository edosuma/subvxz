<i>When it was getting cold.</i>

35:26.541 --> 35:27.907
<i>How long will you stay?</i>

35:28.918 --> 35:32.411
Just today, I'm sorry.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.169
I have to get back to Paris.
So many things to do.

35:37.302 --> 35:43.014
And they told me you were in a hospital,
and I took the first train.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.809
Can't you stay any longer?

35:51.524 --> 35:53.186
I can't, I'm sorry.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.147
[sighs]

35:56.237 --> 35:59.321
It took one day and a night to get here.

36:00.325 --> 36:04.444
- And I'm a married man now.
- I know you are.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.745
I'm very happy for Jo and you.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.666
Vincent...

36:18.093 --> 36:20.585
Why did they put you here?

36:20.679 --> 36:23.922
I have no idea, Theo. I swear to you.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.631
[exhales]

36:27.102 --> 36:28.468
There must be a reason.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.389
From time to time, I...

36:35.443 --> 36:37.651
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

36:39.906 --> 36:44.116
Yes, my mind goes out of me,
I'm telling you. It goes out of me.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.443
What do you mean?

36:46.830 --> 36:51.871
They say that I scream
in the streets, that I cry,

36:51.960 --> 36:57.001
that I put black paint on my face
to scare the children.

36:57.090 --> 37:00.800
But... I don't remember anything.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.549
Anything except...

37:06.141 --> 37:08.884
the darkness and anxiety,

37:10.103 --> 37:11.685
so they sent me here.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.229
With really insane people.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.690
Do you drink a lot?

37:28.955 --> 37:30.366
I must tell you...

37:30.457 --> 37:32.949
[whispers] Don't-don't tell it
to the doctors...

37:35.587 --> 37:38.546
Theo, sometimes I have visions.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.749
- What do you see?
- It's hard to say.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.840
- Ghosts?
- I don't know.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.932
Flowers, sometimes...

37:51.186 --> 37:55.100
and also angels, human beings.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.765
It's confusing.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.519
Sometimes they talk to me.

38:01.613 --> 38:05.027
- What do they say?
- I don't understand them.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.154
But it's frightening.
They aren't always very nice.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.913
I will talk to the doctors
and see what can be done.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.670
When I get like this...

38:22.842 --> 38:24.754
I don't know what I'm capable of.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.255
Maybe I could kill...

38:31.392 --> 38:33.349
and throw myself off a cliff.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.144
[cries]

38:53.039 --> 38:54.655
[indistinct chatter nearby]

39:14.853 --> 39:16.890
[Theo] <i>Dear Paul,</i>

39:16.980 --> 39:20.018
<i>I know you've been in correspondence
with my brother Vincent,</i>

39:20.108 --> 39:23.647
<i>and he is very much looking forward
to your arrival in Arles,</i>

39:23.736 --> 39:27.946
<i>which I know has been postponed
due to financial concerns.</i>

39:28.032 --> 39:32.026
<i>I am prepared and committed to sending
250 francs each month</i>

39:32.120 --> 39:35.864
<i>in exchange for one painting
a month of yours, at your discretion.</i>

39:37.041 --> 39:40.284
<i>It would benefit Vincent greatly
to see you as soon as possible.</i>

39:41.296 --> 39:42.832
<i>A warm handshake.</i>

39:42.922 --> 39:46.290
<i>Enthusiastically, Theo van Gogh.</i>

39:47.343 --> 39:52.338
<i>P.S. Looking forward to your response
and to seeing your latest works.</i>

39:57.186 --> 39:59.929
Of all the miseries that afflict humanity,

40:00.023 --> 40:03.141
nothing maddens me more
than the lack of money.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.645
But not tonight.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.486
[indistinct chatter]

40:10.491 --> 40:11.732
Another round, <i>madame.</i>

40:13.161 --> 40:14.161
[Mme. Ginoux] Gaby.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.862
[speaks French]

40:16.956 --> 40:21.075
Some days, I feel like a beggar,
but not today.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.796
It's so good to see you, Vincent,
and this fine group.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.249
I'm happy to see you, Paul.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.926
But really, no one around here
really likes me,

40:31.012 --> 40:32.674
except <i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur</i> Ginoux.

40:32.764 --> 40:37.429
Sometimes... it's days
before I speak to someone.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.094
I've been waiting for this moment.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.644
But you were so indecisive!
I'm glad you made up your mind.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.394
Is your brother still sending you money?

40:48.488 --> 40:51.526
- Two hundred and fifty francs a month.
- [chuckles] Not much.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.399
He does what he can.

40:54.494 --> 40:57.202
- Did you make an arrangement with him?
- Yeah.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.285
He pays my expenses here,
and I send him a canvas a month.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.834
- And you're happy with that?
- It's all right.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.328
It's acceptable.

41:06.422 --> 41:09.005
You have such a compelling face.

41:10.009 --> 41:13.593
Maybe you'd come over to the yellow house
and, uh, pose for me.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.713
Maybe.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.299
I'll take that as a yes.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.471
[Vincent chuckles]

41:23.523 --> 41:25.230
[insects trilling]

41:28.611 --> 41:30.398
Why do you always
have to paint from nature?

41:31.864 --> 41:34.447
I feel lost if I don't have
something to look at.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.823
I need something to see.
There's so much to see.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.620
Every time I look, I see something
I've never seen before.

41:43.710 --> 41:46.373
Yes, but what you paint,
what you do belongs to you.

41:47.547 --> 41:50.210
- You don't need to copy anything.
- I don't copy.

41:50.299 --> 41:53.508
I know, but why don't you paint
just what's in your mind?

41:53.594 --> 41:55.586
What your brain sees?

41:55.680 --> 41:58.138
Because the essence of nature is beauty.

41:59.142 --> 42:00.678
What do you mean?

42:00.768 --> 42:03.497
What do you mean, what do I mean?
Why did you want to go to Madagascar?

42:03.521 --> 42:06.184
To get away from society, from people.

42:06.274 --> 42:09.517
That may have been part of it,
but you went there in search of beauty,

42:09.610 --> 42:11.693
and nature was definitely there.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.271
And it was different
than what you knew before,

42:14.365 --> 42:17.073
and it made your paintings look different.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.618
When I look at nature...

42:20.621 --> 42:22.453
I see more clearly...

42:23.583 --> 42:25.700
the tie that unites us all.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.832
A vibrating energy...

42:30.214 --> 42:31.625
speaking in God's voice.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.208
Sometimes it's so intense,
I lose consciousness.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.510
- [scoffs] Come on.
- I swear to you.

42:36.596 --> 42:41.557
After a while, I wake up and I don't know
where I am or what I'm doing.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.727
It takes me some minutes
to even remember my name.

42:45.813 --> 42:49.147
Listen, Vincent, the time is coming
when painters won't need anymore

42:49.233 --> 42:51.441
to look at models and sit down
in front of nature.

42:51.527 --> 42:52.813
You know why?

42:52.904 --> 42:56.648
Because nature is what we see here
in our heads. Nothing else!

42:56.741 --> 42:58.653
Without our eyes, there's no nature.

42:58.743 --> 43:00.860
And none of us sees the world
around us the same way.

43:00.953 --> 43:03.411
We sit, you and I,
in front of the same landscape,

43:03.498 --> 43:06.115
we don't see the same
mountains, the same trees.

43:06.209 --> 43:09.021
[Vincent] Well, that's what I'm saying.
The trees that I paint are mine.

43:09.045 --> 43:12.083
Even the faces you paint are yours.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.165
And they'll stay because of you.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.375
People will be known
because you painted them,

43:16.469 --> 43:19.052
and how you painted them,
not because of who they are.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.970
- That's good.
- And people will go to museums

43:21.057 --> 43:23.891
to see paintings of people,
not to see people who were painted.

43:23.976 --> 43:27.185
You know, people don't always like
the way they look in my paintings.

43:28.898 --> 43:31.185
We have to start a revolution.
Do you understand?

43:31.275 --> 43:34.814
Yes, we do. Us, our generation.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.816
We have to change entirely

43:36.906 --> 43:40.240
the relation between painting
and what you call nature.

43:41.244 --> 43:42.826
Between painting and reality,

43:42.912 --> 43:46.121
because painted reality
is its own reality.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.228
[Vincent] You're right about that.

43:49.252 --> 43:51.835
- [both urinating]
- [Gauguin] The impressionists,

43:51.921 --> 43:53.958
they're out of it, do you agree?

43:54.048 --> 43:56.335
- [clicking tongue] Uh...
- Come on.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.153
They only paint their babies
in their gardens.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.463
They'll never go any further.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.593
Seurat confounds painting with science.

44:03.683 --> 44:06.300
He's lost himself in optical experiments.

44:07.562 --> 44:11.977
There's nothing more to expect
from Renoir, Degas, Monet...

44:12.066 --> 44:14.419
They repeat themselves.
They've given everything they could give.

44:14.443 --> 44:17.186
[Vincent] You don't mean that.
You like Degas.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.528
You have to say thank you
for the paintings you like.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.743
- Monet's pretty good.
- [Gauguin] It's our turn.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.159
We have a huge responsibility.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.115
[Vincent] I still think
Monet's pretty good.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.462
You want to go to Martinique?

44:39.302 --> 44:40.668
[breathing heavily]

45:00.823 --> 45:02.303
[Vincent] It's good to have you here.

45:25.389 --> 45:26.425
[flapping]

45:38.778 --> 45:39.778
[door shuts]

45:40.863 --> 45:42.525
[footsteps approaching]

45:43.532 --> 45:44.693
[door opens]

46:23.406 --> 46:25.363
Could you put your hand
back how it was?

47:00.693 --> 47:01.693
Thank you.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.359
- Can I go?
- You can go.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.375
You have to plan your paintings slowly.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.173
What's the rush?

47:30.389 --> 47:31.971
Work calmly, slowly.

47:32.058 --> 47:36.473
You're indoors, you're not outside
in the wind and the noise.

47:36.562 --> 47:40.055
Paintings have to be done
in one clear gesture.

47:48.074 --> 47:49.914
Think about the surface
that you're painting on

47:49.992 --> 47:51.483
and how the paint will sit on it.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.287
You're changing things so fast,
you can't even see what you've done.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.577
Paintings have to be painted fast.

48:02.922 --> 48:05.630
[up-tempo piano music playing]

48:39.083 --> 48:40.483
[Vincent] <i>The painters I look at...</i>

48:44.547 --> 48:45.708
<i>Frans Hals,</i>

48:53.347 --> 48:54.347
<i>Goya,</i>

49:02.481 --> 49:03.562
<i>Velazquez,</i>

49:08.404 --> 49:09.520
<i>Veronese,</i>

49:18.914 --> 49:19.995
<i>Delacroix.</i>

49:26.505 --> 49:31.876
<i>The painters I like all paint fast
in one clear gesture, each stroke.</i>

49:34.013 --> 49:37.051
You've heard of "a stroke of genius"?
Well, that's what it means.

49:38.934 --> 49:42.894
You don't even paint that way.
You paint fast and you overpaint.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.973
Your surface looks
like it's made out of clay.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.228
It's more like sculpture than painting.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.914
[Gauguin] <i>You don't even paint like that.</i>

50:03.000 --> 50:05.037
<i>You paint fast and then you overpaint.</i>

50:05.127 --> 50:07.164
<i>Your surface looks
like it's made out of clay.</i>

50:08.297 --> 50:10.414
<i>It's more like sculpture than painting.</i>

50:10.508 --> 50:12.249
[insects chirping]

50:40.538 --> 50:42.245
[insects chirping]

50:45.042 --> 50:47.159
I'm telling you,
you have to look inside.

50:48.462 --> 50:51.375
You keep saying "look inside."
I get it, I do.

50:51.465 --> 50:53.582
You keep repeating yourself.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.592
What do you think I'm doing?

50:56.679 --> 50:59.592
I don't invent the picture.

50:59.682 --> 51:02.140
I don't need to invent the picture.

51:02.226 --> 51:06.470
I find it already in nature.
I just have to free it.

51:06.564 --> 51:09.181
All right, I'm just saying,
first think about your surface

51:09.275 --> 51:11.358
and how the paint will sit on it.

51:11.443 --> 51:14.277
Get control over what you're doing.

51:14.363 --> 51:16.025
Maybe you should work inside more.

51:17.283 --> 51:21.243
I've spent all my life alone, in a room.

51:21.328 --> 51:25.993
I need to go out and work
to forget myself.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.333
I want to be out of control.

51:28.419 --> 51:31.082
- I need to be in a feverish state.
- [wings flapping]

51:31.171 --> 51:33.163
It's called the act
of painting for a reason.

51:33.257 --> 51:37.001
- All right, calm down.
- I don't want to calm down.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.211
The faster I paint, the better I feel.

51:39.305 --> 51:43.549
- I can't stay here, Vincent.
- What are you saying?

51:46.729 --> 51:48.220
I can't stay in Arles.

51:49.565 --> 51:50.851
I'll go soon.

51:54.862 --> 51:55.862
What?

51:55.946 --> 51:58.814
I've sold some paintings lately.
Maybe your brother told you?

51:58.907 --> 52:00.239
And I have to get back to Paris.

52:06.915 --> 52:07.996
Where are you going?

52:11.295 --> 52:12.295
Vincent!

52:13.297 --> 52:14.754
[panting]

52:16.300 --> 52:18.212
[groaning]

52:20.387 --> 52:24.256
[Vincent] <i>I've spent
all my life alone, in a room.</i>

52:24.350 --> 52:27.718
<i>- I need to go out and work...</i>
- [Gauguin] What are you doing?

52:27.811 --> 52:29.928
[Vincent] <i>...to forget myself.</i>

52:30.022 --> 52:31.291
<i>- I want to be out of control.</i>
- [Gauguin] What?

52:31.315 --> 52:34.103
<i>I need to be in a feverish state.</i>

52:34.193 --> 52:36.105
<i>It's called the act of painting
for a reason.</i>

52:36.195 --> 52:38.278
[Gauguin] <i>All right, calm down.</i>

52:38.364 --> 52:42.028
<i>I don't want to calm down.
The faster I paint, the better I feel.</i>

52:42.117 --> 52:43.653
[crying]

52:46.246 --> 52:47.532
Why are you crying?

52:50.250 --> 52:52.663
What did I do?
Where did I go wrong?

52:52.753 --> 52:56.246
Nothing. You have nothing to do
with this decision.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.175
Vincent, we can't live side by side.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.878
Our temperaments are incompatible,
you must admit that.

53:06.350 --> 53:08.717
And you have to understand,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.083

57:03.337 --> 57:04.873
He was about to leave.

57:06.089 --> 57:09.002

was a way to keep him next to you?

But I'd like to help you.

I don't know what it is.

and sometimes it frightens me.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.337
I think I'm losing my mind.

57:52.427 --> 57:55.841
But then I say to myself,

57:57.849 --> 58:02.719
"I'll show what I see
to my human brothers who can't see it."

58:02.813 --> 58:06.352
It's a privilege.
I can give them hope and consolation.

58:09.277 --> 58:11.143

You might be asking too much of people.

58:26.795 --> 58:31.586
I'd like to share my vision with people

58:31.675 --> 58:32.882
Yes, but why?

58:34.845 --> 58:39.306
Because my vision is closer
to the reality of the world.

58:39.391 --> 58:44.056
I can make people feel
what it's like to be alive.

58:45.897 --> 58:49.686
- Do you feel like they don't feel alive?
- Yes, I do.

58:54.072 --> 58:56.815
And you think you can make them
feel that through painting?

58:56.908 --> 59:00.276
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

59:01.580 --> 59:02.741
Yes.

59:05.250 --> 59:09.585
Gaby said your ear
was wrapped in this,

59:09.671 --> 59:12.459
and she was supposed to give it to Paul.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.922

what did you mean by that?

59:17.012 --> 59:18.423

59:22.809 --> 59:25.496
Maybe you were trying to show him
what he meant to you through that act,

59:25.520 --> 59:27.762
but that was something you couldn't see.

59:31.193 --> 59:36.109
I didn't want him to leave.
It was a way to get him back.

59:36.198 --> 59:39.612
Jesus said, "If thy hand offend thee,
cut it off."

59:40.869 --> 59:42.280
So you cut off your ear

59:42.370 --> 59:45.113
because you couldn't bear
to hear what Paul was saying?

59:46.124 --> 59:49.458

a menacing spirit around me.

He speaks to me and threatens me.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:04.349
And all he wants to do
is plunge a knife into my heart.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:08.053
I saw him and I tried to cut him
out of myself.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.934
So that's the reason
why you cut off your ear.

- Yes.

- No, not at all.

It's your choice, but you'll be subjected
to their rules and methods of care.

some peace there.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:02.357

you can even paint there.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.941

Of course.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.604
[Vincent] Look at me.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.110
Please.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.611
[conversing in French]

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880
[Vincent] <i>Oui.</i>

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.740
[Vincent] <i>Oui.</i>

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.507
[grunting]

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.712
No...

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.009
[woman stuttering]

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:05.152

[melancholy piano music playing]

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:13.785
[carriage rattling]

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.495
[Gauguin] <i>My dear Vincent,</i>

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:09.045
<i>I've looked most attentively
at your works since we parted.</i>

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:13.300
<i>First at your brother's place,
and then at Independence Exhibition.</i>

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:18.180
<i>It's above all at this latter place
that one can properly judge what you do.</i>

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:21.433
<i>Either because of things
positioned beside each other,</i>

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.309
<i>or because of neighboring works.</i>

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.855
<i>I offer you my sincere compliments.</i>

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:31.564
<i>And for many artists, you are
the most remarkable in the exhibition.</i>

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.401
<i>With things from nature,
you're the only one there who thinks.</i>

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.908
<i>I've talked about it with your brother,</i>

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.893
<i>and there's one that I would like
to exchange with you</i>

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.328
<i>for one thing of your choice.</i>

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.085
<i>I hesitated greatly to write to you,</i>

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:48.505
<i>knowing that you had just had
a rather long crisis.</i>

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:52.842
<i>So, please don't reply to me
until you feel completely strong.</i>

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.216
<i>Let's hope that, with the warm weather
that will return,</i>

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.218
<i>you're going to get well at last.</i>

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.140
"The winter
is always dangerous to you.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:04.054
Cordially, ever yours, Paul Gauguin."

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:09.142
[melancholy classical music playing]

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.376
[no audio]

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:08.205
[guard] Van Gogh!

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.329
Van Gogh!

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:13.965
Not here, there.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.752
There. There.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.741
Follow me.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.065
- Here he is.
- Thank you.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.076
Please help me take it off.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.755
Thank you.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.047
- Better?
- Yes.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.133
Come, sit with me. Talk to me.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.931
Please.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.445
I suppose you know why you're here.

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:04.610
[sighs] Talking to you now?

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.243
To get better.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:12.041
Or because I walked out of the asylum.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.912
What happened on the road to Arles?

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:18.590
I don't remember.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.505
You did walk out of the asylum.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.263
I wanted to go out.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:33.138
The townspeople of Arles have signed
a petition against you.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:36.600
- They don't want you to come back there.
- Yes, I know.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.866
- Did you ever molest a child?
- No. Never.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:54.622
Did you cut off one of your ears
to give it to a prostitute? Is that true?

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:57.546
Yes, I did. But Gaby's not a prostitute.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.673
Why did you do that?

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:04.218
[sighs] I wanted her to give it
to a friend of mine.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:06.638
And she did?

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.303
I don't know.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.137
And that was a strange offer, wasn't it?

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.642
Do you feel angry sometimes?

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:24.238
Yes.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.151
And what do you do then?

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:35.042
I go out and look at a blade of grass
or a branch of a fig tree

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.618
in order to calm down.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:41.460
- And it works?
- Yes.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.715
I feel God is nature
and nature is beauty.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.969
I've seen you in the garden, painting.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.690
And I've heard from others
that you say you were a painter.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.314
Yes, that's what I am.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:05.984
Why do you say that?

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.568
- Do you have a gift for painting?
- Yes.

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.488
Where does this gift come from?

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:18.376
Would you say that God gave you
the gift of painting?

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.954
Yes, He did. It's the only gift
He gave me.

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:36.595
- Did you paint this?
- Yes, I did.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.975
- And you call it a painting?
- Yes, of course.

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:43.731
Tell me frankly,
because I'd like to understand.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.187
Why do you say you're a painter?

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:50.112
Because I paint.
I love painting. I have to paint.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.286
I've always been a painter.
That, I know.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.954
- A born painter?
- Yes.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:00.080
How do you know?

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:06.007
Because I can't do anything else.
And believe me, I've tried.

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:16.851
So, God gave you a gift
so you could paint this?

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:19.808
Yes.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.568
But don't you see... [swallows]

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:29.026
Now look, carefully. Please.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:35.078
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but don't you see that this painting is...

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.199
How can I say... [clears throat]

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.458
Unpleasant. It's ugly.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:50.465
Why would God give me a gift to paint
ugly and disturbing things?

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.266
Sometimes I...

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.645
feel so far away from everything.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.396
- Does anybody buy your paintings?
- No.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:12.107
- So, you're poor?
- Yes, rather poor.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.910
How do you live?

01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:21.749
Well, my brother, Theo,
pays for me to be here.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:23.997
But he's not a rich man either.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:31.001
So, you believe
that God gave you this gift

01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:33.382
because He wants to keep you in misery?

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.597
Huh.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.633
I never thought about it that way.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.644
And which way do you think?

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.774
Sometimes I think...

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.773
- Yes?
- Maybe, maybe...

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:54.699
- Go on.
- Maybe He chose the wrong time.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:58.556
What do you mean the wrong time?

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.164
Maybe God made me a painter for people
who aren't born yet.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.374
Possibly.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:11.174
It is said, "Life is for sowing.
The harvest is not here."

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:18.173
I paint with my qualities and faults.

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:30.109
So, you think
God could've been mistaken?

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:38.448
I think of myself as an exile,
a pilgrim on this earth.

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:42.906
Jesus said, "Turn your heart away
from things visible

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.289
and turn yourself to things invisible."

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.623
- Indeed. But...
- And Jesus also

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.881
was totally unknown
when He was alive.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:00.382
- How do you know that?
- My father was a pastor.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.388
I've been around religion all my life.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.103
Really? A pastor?

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.309
Yes, and before I realized
I was a painter...

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:16.902
I tried myself to be a man of God,
so I learned quite a bit about the topic.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.776
So you know the Gospels?

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.702
Not only the Gospels,

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:25.077
I can tell you that Jesus
wasn't discovered

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:28.126
until 30 or 40 years after he died.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:31.080
When he was alive,
nobody talked about him.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:36.544
There's not even a letter from a Roman
centurion to his wife in Rome

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:39.675
saying that a man named Jeshua

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:42.348
was crucified in Jerusalem
with some other criminals.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.050
Not a word, nothing.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.818
You know, this is my job to decide
if you're well enough to leave this place.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:08.329
This reminds me of Jesus on the terrace.

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:10.952
Which terrace?

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:13.379
Speaking to Pilate,

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:17.004
who definitively, if you
believe what was written,

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:21.054
didn't want to crucify him.
It was the people.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:25.725
Yes. We could have a real discussion
about this theory some other time.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.269
Pilate didn't want to crucify Jesus,

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:32.474
but everything Christ said
incriminated him, so...

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:36.982
I, too...

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:42.450
have to be careful
with what I say to you.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.496
I can understand that.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:55.380
Listen, come see me again
if you feel like.

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.499
And share some other ideas with me.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.972
In the meantime, Dr. Rey
is here waiting for you.

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:08.096
- He came to take you home.
- I'm free to go?

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.102
I think we've done
all we can for you here.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.321
I hope I'm ready.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:23.862
I hope so, too.

01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:58.643
[Vincent]
Please return these things

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:00.524
to <i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur</i> Ginoux.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:04.365
- They've been real friends.
- Sure, I will.

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.363
And give them that book.
Tell them thank you.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.024
[knock on door, door opens]

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.565
- Hello.
- [Dr. Rey] <i>Bonjour.</i>

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:49.576
This is very important.

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:51.620
Make sure <i>Madame</i> Ginoux receives it.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:54.950
It is from the painter Vincent van Gogh.
He apologizes for the delay.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.672
A bundle of towels,

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:12.475
a ledger,
and two empty olive boxes.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:27.466
[Vincent] My work's all here.
You didn't sell anything.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:31.091
Not yet, but Aurier's review
was excellent, really wonderful.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:34.765
That review was absurd. I don't deserve
anything that man said.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.808
- Far from it.
- Yes, you do.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:38.636
[Theo] The review will help.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.357
[Vincent] I think...

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.657
I'm beyond caring
what anyone thinks, but...

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.197
I care what you think, Theo.

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:57.245
Tell me, I want to know the truth.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:59.786
Am I a good painter?

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.521
[Theo, overlapping]
You're not a good painter,

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:02.877
Vincent. You're a great painter.

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:04.124
[Vincent] Are you sure?

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:06.001
Of course, I'm sure.
Why would I lie to you?

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:09.255
I mean, you're my brother.
You're my brother.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.210
Just to please me.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.140
- [Theo] I wouldn't do that.
- [Jo] No, Theo would never do that.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:23.098
People say that I don't know how to draw,
how to paint.

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:28.607
They say my paintings are clumsy, ugly.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:31.656
I used to care what people thought.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.733
But not anymore.

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:36.194
[voices continue overlapping]
I have no choice.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:39.872
If I couldn't paint,
I would murder someone.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.075
[Theo] That's why I send you
money for your paintings

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:44.535
because I really believe
you are a great painter.

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.838
And I'm a businessman.
I'm a business man, after all.

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.712
So, you paint,
and leave the rest to us.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.169
<i>You paint
and let us do the rest.</i>

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:55.380
[Vincent]
Gauguin sent me this letter.

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:57.243
- Yes, I knew he wrote to you.
- Did you see him?

Is he here?

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:03.666
I really don't know.
Yes, I knew he wrote to you.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.478
[Jo] What about Aurier or Bernard?

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:08.935
Do you want to see them?
I know they're in town.

I can't stand it here. It's not my place.

01:30:17.996 --> 01:30:22.536

I can't see anybody.

A little village.

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:34.047
There's a lovely little inn
in Auvers-sur-Oise.

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:37.596
Pissarro knows a doctor there
who knows your work, loves art,

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:41.767
and maybe he can help you
without getting in the way.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.812
- [Jo] And we could come and see you.
- [Vincent] I'll go there tomorrow?

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:46.514
Let me look into it.

Why do you paint?

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.223
I paint...

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:26.429
as a matter of fact, to stop thinking.

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:31.392
A sort of meditation.

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:38.032
- When I paint, I stop thinking.
- About what?

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:42.035
I stop thinking...

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:44.371
and I feel...

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:51.121
that I'm a part of everything
outside and inside of me.

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.383
I wanted...

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:03.591
so much to share what I see.

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:06.514
An artist...

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:10.727
[Dr. Gachet] Yes?

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:15.944
[sighs] I thought an artist...

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:21.697
had to teach how to look at the world.
But I don't think that anymore.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:26.906
Now I just think
about my relationship to eternity.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.952
What do you call eternity?

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:35.836
- Time to come.
- Hmm.

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:41.963
Maybe what you are saying is
that your gift to the world is painting.

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:43.298

You're happy
when you're painting?

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:54.400
Most of the time, except when I fail.

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.278
You look sad sometimes.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.784
[sighs] There's a lot of destruction
and failure

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:06.533
at the door of a successful picture.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:17.415
I find joy in sorrow.

01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:19.967
And sorrow is greater than laughter.

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:21.169
You know...

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:26.716
an angel is not far
from those who are sad.

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:30.640
And illness
can sometimes heal us.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.730
It's the normal state...

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:40.737
that gives birth to painting.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.193
You feel that way?

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:49.948
Sometimes I hate the idea
of regaining my health.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.875
[laughs] In that case,
you don't need a doctor.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:56.045
Stop laughing. Stop smiling.

01:33:56.131 --> 01:33:57.338

- Excuse me.

Sometimes they say I'm mad...

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.478
but a grain of madness
is the best of art.

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:22.564
You're not a mad man.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.910
