WEBVTT

00:07.138 --> 00:09.080
( sighs )

00:09.080 --> 00:10.381
I KNOW WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.043
SOMEONE IS EATING BACON
IN FRONT OF YOU,

00:12.043 --> 00:14.515
AND NOT OFFERING
YOU ANY.
NO, STAN,
THAT'S NOT IT.

00:14.515 --> 00:18.549
THEN ARE YOU, PERHAPS,
BOTHERED BY YOUR INABILITY

00:18.549 --> 00:20.321
TO TAKE A HINT?

00:22.523 --> 00:25.526
TOMORROW'S THE FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL. SUMMER'S OVER.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.659
NO MORE LEARNING
HOW TO PLAY GUITAR,
OR PLANTING TREES,

00:28.659 --> 00:30.601
OR VOLUNTEERING
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

00:30.601 --> 00:32.303
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

00:32.303 --> 00:34.535
AND NOW I NEVER WILL.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.509
HERE, STAN.
SCHOOL'S MADE
ME NOT HUNGRY.
YEAH!

00:38.509 --> 00:43.074
THANKS, SCHOOL!
NO BACON LEFT BEHIND.

00:43.074 --> 00:44.675
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT IT'S TURKEY BACON?

00:44.675 --> 00:48.219
SO, I'VE EATEN A MOUSE,
THROWN IT UP,
AND EATEN IT AGAIN.

00:48.219 --> 00:51.652
I'M NOT WHAT YOU
WOULD CALL FANCY.

00:53.624 --> 00:56.157
HEY, TYLER.
YOU READY TO DO IT?
DO WHAT?

00:56.157 --> 00:58.759
LAST YEAR,
WE AGREED YOU COULD
ONLY KEEP YOUR HAIR

00:58.759 --> 01:01.532
THIS RIDICULOUSLY LONG
IF YOU GOT ALL As AND Bs.

01:01.532 --> 01:03.594
WELL, YOU GOT
A COUPLE OF Cs, BUDDY.

01:03.594 --> 01:07.198
AND C IS FOR CUT.
TIME TO CUT YOUR HAIR.

01:07.198 --> 01:10.201
I ALSO GOT A D--
OH, WHY DID I SAY THAT?

01:11.242 --> 01:12.543
WE HAD A DEAL,
TYLER.

01:12.543 --> 01:15.206
WHAT KIND OF PARENTS
WOULD WE BE IF WE
DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH?

01:15.206 --> 01:18.679
YOUR SON IS GETTING
Cs AND Ds, COULD YOU
DO ANY WORSE?

01:18.679 --> 01:20.651
COME ON, TYLER.
I'VE BEEN CUTTING
YOUR HAIR

01:20.651 --> 01:22.653
SINCE YOU WERE LITTLE
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS LIKED IT.

01:22.653 --> 01:26.487
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUN?
MAYBE TAKE THIS OFF HERE.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.360
YEAH, AND FEATHER
THIS HERE.
OH, I COULD
TAPER IT HERE.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.562
I THINK MY HAND'S
STUCK UNDER HERE.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.694
OH, I'M GOING
TO CUT THAT ALL OFF.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.697
OKAY, YOU MADE YOUR POINT.
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO STUDY

01:36.697 --> 01:39.500
HARDER THIS YEAR.
NO NEED TO KEEP PRETENDING

01:39.500 --> 01:41.472
YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO DO THIS.

01:41.472 --> 01:42.833
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO DO THIS?

01:44.435 --> 01:48.209
( yells )
TYLER, I HAVEN'T
EVEN DONE ANYTHING YET.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.711
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.
LET ME TRY.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.644
( yells )

01:53.644 --> 01:55.786
I THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT HAPPEN.

01:55.786 --> 01:59.350
CHLOE, WE'RE NOT DOING THIS
FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.592
DID I MISS IT? SHOULD I MAKE
POPCORN? DID YOU MAKE POPCORN?

02:01.592 --> 02:03.754
WHY HAS NO ONE
MADE POPCORN?

02:03.754 --> 02:06.257
AVERY, AS I JUST GOT
DONE TELLING YOUR SISTER,

02:06.257 --> 02:08.159
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS
FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.

02:08.159 --> 02:10.501
SIT HERE NEXT TO ME--
IT'S THE BEST VIEW.

02:10.501 --> 02:12.363
HAVE SOME POPCORN.

02:14.605 --> 02:17.408
OKAY, TYLER,
HERE WE GO.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.873
( crying )
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

02:22.873 --> 02:26.677
OH, SO MUCH BODY,
SO MUCH WAVE.

02:26.677 --> 02:30.851
OH, AND I'LL MISS
YOU MOST OF ALL,
FRIZZY COWLICK.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.324
Stan: WELL, AT LEAST THIS TIME
I WASN'T THE ONE BEING GROOMED.

02:33.324 --> 02:37.258
AND, MAN, I'VE HAD SOME PRETTY
CRAZY HAIRCUTS OVER THE YEARS.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.630
CORNROWS.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.263
POMPADOUR.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.765
PRINCESS LEIA.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.799
SO, WHAT DOES
EVERYBODY THINK?

02:48.799 --> 02:53.804
WELL, YOU CAN SEE HIS FACE
WHICH IS... A FACT.

02:53.804 --> 02:57.748
LOOK AT ME.
I'M MAKING HAIR ANGELS.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.681
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT,
TYLER.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.813
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

03:02.813 --> 03:04.655
HAND ME
THE MIRROR.

03:07.788 --> 03:12.393
NO!

03:12.393 --> 03:15.266
♪♪

03:29.710 --> 03:33.814
( laughing )
OH, TOLSTOY.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.387
( giggling )

03:38.919 --> 03:42.423
HEE HEE HEE!

03:42.423 --> 03:44.425
WELL, YOU SEEM HAPPY,
AVERY.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.557
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY?
WELL, MAINLY THIS.

03:46.557 --> 03:50.501
( imitating )
HEE HEE HEE!

03:50.501 --> 03:53.934
I'M SO EXCITED, STAN, BECAUSE
TODAY'S THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.438
I JUST LOVE SCHOOL.
ALL THE READING AND STUDYING;

03:57.438 --> 03:59.710
THE RUSH YOU GET WHEN
YOU CORRECT A TEACHER.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.413
IT'S LIKE GRIFTING
A GRIFTER.

04:04.915 --> 04:08.579
AND WHY DID I PICK
A ROCK STAR RABBIT LUNCHBOX?

04:08.579 --> 04:11.422
EVERYONE'S GOING TO CALL ME
ROCK STAR RABBIT.

04:11.422 --> 04:12.723
CHLOE, NO ONE'S GOING
TO CALL YOU THAT

04:12.723 --> 04:13.924
'CAUSE OF YOUR LUNCHBOX.

04:13.924 --> 04:16.557
OH, MOMMY.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.629
LAST YEAR I PICKED
A LITTLE RED LUNCHBOX

04:18.629 --> 04:21.261
AND EVERYONE CALLED ME
LITTLE RED ALL YEAR.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.663
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHY.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.964
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

04:25.696 --> 04:29.470
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO HIDE IT FOREVER.

04:30.901 --> 04:33.003
WELL I HAVE TO TRY,
DON'T I?

04:33.003 --> 04:36.907
THANKS TO YOU, NOW I HAVE
TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOMETHING.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.480
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.
DON'T WANNA BE LATE.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.882
TYLER, MAKE SURE CHLOE
GETS SAFELY TO HER CLASS.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.955
AVERY, MAKE SURE TYLER GETS
SAFELY TO HIS CLASS.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.663
LINDSAY!

04:52.663 --> 04:55.065
( both yelling )

04:55.065 --> 04:57.027
WAIT, WE'RE
IN EIGHTH GRADE NOW.

04:57.027 --> 04:58.469
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
BE A LITTLE MORE COOL.

04:58.469 --> 04:59.930
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
REDO.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.734
Both:
S'UP.

05:03.734 --> 05:04.735
HEY, GUYS.

05:04.735 --> 05:05.836
Both:
MAX!

05:05.836 --> 05:07.778
I'M SO GLAD OUR
LITTLE GROUP IS BACK.

05:07.778 --> 05:10.581
WOW, THAT'S SO NICE.
USUALLY YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE.

05:10.581 --> 05:12.513
I'M JUST RELIEVED YOU'RE HERE.
I WAS CERTAIN THAT OVER

05:12.513 --> 05:15.346
THE SUMMER ONE OF US WOULD GET
SUCKED INTO A PIT OF QUICKSAND.

05:15.346 --> 05:17.848
THERE'S OUR MAX.
WE'RE NOT GETTING
SUCKED IN QUICKSAND.

05:17.848 --> 05:20.090
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY,
UNTIL THE DAY IT HAPPENS.

05:20.090 --> 05:22.753
AND REMEMBER,
STRUGGLING ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.

05:22.753 --> 05:27.658
WELL, THE IMPORTANT
THING IS, WE'RE ALL BACK
AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

05:27.658 --> 05:30.561
OKAY, ANNIE HAS CHANGED.
SHE LOST HER BRACES
AND GOT HER...

05:30.561 --> 05:32.763
All:
YEAH.

05:32.763 --> 05:37.768
WOW, NATALIE'S,
LIKE, A FOOT TALLER.
AND SO IS KIM.

05:37.768 --> 05:39.870
AND BRIAN.
AND AMANDA.

05:39.870 --> 05:43.944
AND PAIGE AND BEN
AND RACHEL AND
XING XAO RUBENSTEIN.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.817
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T GROW.
I FEEL LIKE I SHRUNK.

05:46.817 --> 05:50.481
WELL, ONLY IN COMPARISON
TO ALL THE OTHER KIDS
WHO LOOK THEIR AGE.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.726
OH, SORRY, I GUESS
THAT'S NOT HELPING.

05:55.726 --> 05:57.528
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE'S
LOOKING AT ME WONDERING,

05:57.528 --> 06:00.060
"LOOK AT AVERY!
WHY DIDN'T SHE GROW?"

06:00.060 --> 06:02.362
I DON'T KNOW WHY!

06:03.894 --> 06:07.037
AVERY, NO ONE WAS LOOKING
AT YOU UNTIL YOU SHOUTED
LIKE A TOTAL LOON.

06:07.037 --> 06:09.640
PEOPLE LOOK AT TOTAL LOONS.
WHICH REMINDS ME,

06:09.640 --> 06:12.072
I SAW YOUR MOM
AT THE SUPERMARKET.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.476
AVERY, KIDS GROW
AT DIFFERENT RATES.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.747
YEAH, I'M ABOUT
YOUR HEIGHT.

06:16.747 --> 06:18.949
LAST YEAR, YOU WERE UP
TO MY WINDSOR KNOT.

06:18.949 --> 06:22.152
YOU'RE GROWING.
I KNOW. I FEEL HUGE.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.416
GROWING'S NOT ALL
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.658
I WENT UP A HAT SIZE
OVER THE SUMMER.

06:27.658 --> 06:30.791
LOST A LOT
OF GOOD FEDORAS.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.723
SO, COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS!

06:36.967 --> 06:39.900
OH, I MISS THE KIDS. I CAN'T
BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING

06:39.900 --> 06:42.773
TO BE GONE ALL DAY.
I WISH THERE WERE SOME WAY

06:42.773 --> 06:46.577
I COULD MISS THEM LESS.
HEY! I'VE GOT IT.

06:46.577 --> 06:51.582
HI, LITTLE AVERY.
HI, LITTLE TYLER.
HI, LITTLE CHLOE.

06:51.582 --> 06:54.515
YOU'LL KEEP ME COMPANY,
WON'T YOU?

06:54.515 --> 06:57.618
WHY DID I MAKE THEM OUT
OF CHEESE?

07:01.622 --> 07:04.825
NO, CUT IT OUT, OKAY?
LEAVE ME ALONE, DANNY!

07:04.825 --> 07:07.698
COME ON! LET'S SEE IT.
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?

07:07.698 --> 07:09.700
I BET IT'S HILARIOUS.
NO! IT'S TOO SHORT.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.662
IT'S HIDEOUS.
I'M A MONSTER.

07:11.662 --> 07:13.764
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I RESPECT THAT.

07:13.764 --> 07:16.136
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SHOW ME, I'M NOT
GONNA PRESSURE YOU TO--

07:16.136 --> 07:17.668
HA!

07:19.510 --> 07:21.071
YOU ARE SO PREDICTABLE.

07:21.071 --> 07:23.814
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS--

07:23.814 --> 07:25.876
HA!

07:25.876 --> 07:28.649
DUDE, I ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
BEFORE YOU DO IT.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.551
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
HA!
OKAY,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.983
I ONLY WORE THREE HOODS.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
GONNA DO THAT.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.156
( barking )

07:36.156 --> 07:38.759
I'LL CATCH YOU
GUYS LATER.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.091
STAN, IT'S THE
MIDDLE OF SCHOOL.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:42.633 --> 07:44.535
GOOD POINT,
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

07:44.535 --> 07:46.196
SO, AS LONG AS
I'M HERE, WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO DO?

07:46.196 --> 07:49.069
YOU WANNA HANG?
MAYBE TALK TRASH ABOUT
GINNY AND JOE?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.642
WHAT DOES SHE
SEE IN HIM?

07:51.642 --> 07:53.974
THERE'S NO COUPLE
AT THE SCHOOL NAMED
GINNY AND JOE.

07:53.974 --> 07:58.909
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS GINNY IS AVAILABLE?

07:58.909 --> 08:01.982
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU JUST HERE
BECAUSE YOU MISS US?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.154
WHAT? NOT "JUST."

08:04.154 --> 08:07.117
I ALSO WAS HOPING
TO BE A LIVE MODEL
FOR THE ART CLASS.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.159
GO HOME, WE'LL BE
BACK AFTER SCHOOL.

08:09.159 --> 08:12.763
FINE, BUT THEY'LL
BE MISSING OUT ON
MY "WHO, ME?" POSE...

08:12.763 --> 08:15.666
"WHO, ME?"

08:16.767 --> 08:18.999
( laughing )

08:18.999 --> 08:21.171
WHOA, WHO'S THE NEW KID?

08:21.171 --> 08:23.574
Stan: WES MANNING.
LOOKED HIM UP ON THE INTERNET.

08:23.574 --> 08:25.836
HE'S A 64-YEAR-OLD
RETIRED MACHINIST

08:25.836 --> 08:29.039
FROM TENAFLY, NEW JERSEY.
THANK YOU, INTERNET.

08:30.681 --> 08:33.944
HE'S REALLY CUTE. WAIT HERE,
I'M GONNA DO A WALK-BY.

08:33.944 --> 08:37.117
YOU'LL PROBABLY
THINK I'M WEIRD,
BUT I'M KIND OF EXCITED.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.849
I REALLY LIKE SCHOOL.
( laughing )

08:38.849 --> 08:40.751
LIKES SCHOOL!

08:40.751 --> 08:43.694
I LIKE GIRLS WHO ARE
SMART AND FUNNY.

08:43.694 --> 08:46.757
LIKES SMART, FUNNY GIRLS.

08:46.757 --> 08:48.899
SO, BECAUSE WE WERE
READING ANIMAL FARM,

08:48.899 --> 08:51.531
HE TOOK US ON
A FIELD TRIP
TO A PETTING ZOO.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.733
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LET

08:52.733 --> 08:57.107
A FOOTBALL COACH TEACH
AN ENGLISH CLASS.
( laughing )

08:59.610 --> 09:02.943
GUYS, HE LIKES READING
AND MAKING FUN
OF FOOTBALL COACHES.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.976
HE'S PERFECT!

09:05.976 --> 09:07.317
WELL, YOU SHOULD
GO TALK TO HIM.

09:07.317 --> 09:10.050
NO. I CAN'T. I MEAN,
HE PROBABLY ONLY LIKES

09:10.050 --> 09:11.922
THE TALL GIRLS WHO
GREW OVER THE SUMMER.

09:11.922 --> 09:15.656
OH, THAT'S CRAZY. YOU'RE SMART
AND FUNNY AND REALLY CUTE.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.688
JUST TALK TO HIM. WHAT'S THE
WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?

09:17.688 --> 09:20.731
YOU WALK OVER THERE,
YOU TRIP,
YOU THROW UP ON YOURSELF.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.933
IT'S CALLED
THE TRIP-PUKE.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.565
OKAY. I'M GONNA DO IT.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.137
I MEAN, WHAT LINDSAY SAID,
NOT THE TRIP-PUKE.

09:27.137 --> 09:30.701
NOBODY PLANS THE TRIP-PUKE.
IT JUST HAPPENS.

09:33.704 --> 09:35.806
JUST LOOK AT
THE SIXTH GRADERS.

09:35.806 --> 09:37.147
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
THAT LITTLE?

09:37.147 --> 09:39.650
I'M NOT... I DON'T...
I'M JUST...

09:39.650 --> 09:42.613
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST--

09:42.613 --> 09:44.084
TOO SHORT.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.687
TOO SHORT!
TOO SHORT! TOO SHORT!

09:46.687 --> 09:49.660
I KNOW IT IS!
STOP MOCKING ME!

09:55.896 --> 09:58.098
YOU'RE HOME,
YOU'RE HOME!

09:58.098 --> 10:00.631
OH, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE BEEN GONE
MONTHS OR YEARS,

10:00.631 --> 10:02.673
BUT I WASN'T SURE
IF YOU WERE EVER COMING BACK!

10:02.673 --> 10:05.776
STAN, I JUST LEFT THIS MORNING
FOR THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.908
AND YOU DIDN'T SEND
ONE POSTCARD.

10:09.179 --> 10:11.642
OH, YOU'RE HOME!
YOU'RE HOME!

10:11.642 --> 10:15.045
OH, I KNOW IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY,
BUT I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

10:15.045 --> 10:16.917
UGH, IT FELT LIKE
A YEAR.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.820
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING!

10:27.197 --> 10:29.129
YOU KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO UP AND DOWN.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.662
I'M TRYING TO GET
TALLER, NOT STRONGER.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.233
YOU'LL JUST MAKE
YOUR ARMS LONGER.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.807
THEY'LL DRAG ON THE GROUND
AND YOU'LL LOOK LIKE A CHIMP.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.638
NOW STOP BEING
SO SELF-INVOLVED
AND HELP ME FIGURE OUT

10:38.638 --> 10:41.641
WHAT TO DO
ABOUT MY HAIR!

10:41.641 --> 10:45.345
WILL YOU STOP OBSESSING
OVER YOUR STUPID HAIR?!
MY HAIR IS TOO SHORT!

10:45.345 --> 10:47.417
MY WHOLE BODY
IS TOO SHORT!
EXACTLY,

10:47.417 --> 10:49.019
SO YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
INVISIBLE.

10:49.019 --> 10:52.783
YOUR PROBLEM DOESN'T
MATTER. I'M UP HERE,
WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE.

10:53.824 --> 10:56.126
( yells in frustration )

10:56.126 --> 10:58.859
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AVERY?
SHE'S UPSET
ABOUT HER BODY.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.763
OKAY, ELLEN, YOU'VE BEEN
PREPARING FOR THIS MOMENT.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.935
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MESS IT UP
LIKE YOUR MOM DID.

11:04.935 --> 11:06.967
I HAD TO HAVE MY LITTLE TALK
WITH MYSELF.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.100
WHICH I'M DOING RIGHT NOW.
GOOD TALK, ELLEN.

11:12.442 --> 11:15.175
SWEETIE...

11:15.175 --> 11:17.708
I UNDERSTAND YOU
ARE HAVING ISSUES
WITH YOUR BODY.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.152
SO, LET'S HAVE
A LITTLE GAL CHAT.

11:22.152 --> 11:24.855
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR
CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ARE.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.787
I'LL OFFER YOU
THE WISDOM I'VE COLLECTED

11:26.787 --> 11:30.220
FROM MY EXPERIENCES
AS A LIFELONG WOMAN.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.323
NOW, JUST POINT TO
A PART OF YOUR BODY
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

11:33.323 --> 11:35.826
( screaming )

11:37.367 --> 11:40.270
THAT TALK WENT SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN I GAVE IT TO MYSELF.

11:42.472 --> 11:44.474
CHLOE, HOW WAS THE FIRST
DAY OF SECOND GRADE?

11:44.474 --> 11:46.336
I LEARNED THAT "ELEPHANT"
HAS A P IN IT.

11:46.336 --> 11:49.239
I DON'T KNOW WHY
NO ONE HERE TOLD ME THAT.

11:49.239 --> 11:51.942
HOW'D THE LUNCHBOX
GO OVER?
THE LUNCHBOX DIDN'T MATTER.

11:51.942 --> 11:54.344
IN SECOND GRADE,
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT'S INSIDE.

11:54.344 --> 11:56.787
I TOLD CHLOE THAT'S
ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.750
LIKE WITH A PERSON.
WHAT MATTERS ISN'T
WHAT'S ON THE--

11:59.750 --> 12:01.191
DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL
BETTER IN THE CAR.

12:01.191 --> 12:03.493
NOT MAKING ME
FEEL BETTER NOW.

12:03.493 --> 12:06.997
I THOUGHT I MADE YOU
A VERY NICE LUNCH.
WELL, APPARENTLY, HON,

12:06.997 --> 12:11.802
LUNCHTIME IS ALL ABOUT TRADING.
YOUR LUNCH HAD NO TRADE VALUE.

12:11.802 --> 12:14.905
THIS WAS ALL I COULD
GET FOR IT.
A BANANA?

12:14.905 --> 12:17.737
NO. JUST THE PEEL.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.842
BUT THEY DIDN'T
TAKE YOUR LUNCH.
IT WAS A PITY PEEL.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.473
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT
WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL.

12:23.473 --> 12:26.216
I'LL TRY AND MAKE
YOU A REALLY GREAT
LUNCH FOR TOMORROW.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.748
THANKS, MOMMY!
I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.381
I BELIEVE IN YOU!
AW, THAT'S SO
SWEET, HONEY.

12:31.381 --> 12:33.423
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DADDY,

12:33.423 --> 12:36.326
SHE RESPONDS
TO ENCOURAGEMENT.

12:36.326 --> 12:39.489
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING
I TAUGHT YOU IN THE CAR
WAS USELESS.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.462
ALL RIGHT, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT MY PROBLEM,

12:42.462 --> 12:44.334
AND I'M GOING
TO TAKE ACTION.

12:44.334 --> 12:45.365
MOM, YOU'RE DRIVING ME
TO THE MALL.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.766
OH, THAT'S GREAT,
SWEETHEART.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.238
AND ON THE WAY THERE,
WE CAN--
IF YOU TRY TO GAL TALK

12:48.238 --> 12:50.100
ME ON THE DRIVE,
I WILL STUNT ROLL

12:50.100 --> 12:53.043
OUT OF THE MOVING CAR
ONTO THE FREEWAY.

12:53.043 --> 12:54.805
WELL, NOT OUT
OF THE MOVING CAR.
I'M NOT A STUNT WOMAN.

12:54.805 --> 12:58.078
THE POINT IS, I'M OUT
OF THERE AS SOON AS
IT'S COMPLETELY SAFE.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.155
AVERY SAID SHE WENT
TO THE MALL AND
FIXED HER PROBLEM.

13:05.155 --> 13:06.817
I WONDER WHAT SHE DID.

13:06.817 --> 13:08.458
I THINK THAT.

13:11.822 --> 13:15.495
SO, THESE PLATFORMS
ADD SIX INCHES,
THE HAIR'S ANOTHER EIGHT,

13:15.495 --> 13:18.328
AND THE VERTICAL STRIPES
ADD THE ILLUSION OF TWO MORE.

13:18.328 --> 13:20.230
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:20.230 --> 13:23.303
HOW ARE WE PLAYING THIS?
WHAT SHE NEEDS TO HEAR
OR WHAT SHE WANTS TO HEAR?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
AVERY, YOU LOOK GREAT!
WANTS TO HEAR--
GOT IT.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.038
YOU LOOK TALL.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.881
WELL, I BETTER GO TALK TO WES
BEFORE I LOSE MY CONFIDENCE.

13:30.881 --> 13:32.512
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF LOOKING LIKE
A GIANT PENCIL

13:32.512 --> 13:34.384
IF YOU CAN'T WRITE
YOUR OWN DESTINY?

13:38.488 --> 13:41.351
HI, I'M AVERY.
SORRY, NOT NOW.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.160
( barking )

13:50.160 --> 13:53.063
STAN, COME HERE!

13:53.063 --> 13:55.465
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU,
YOU CAN'T COME
TO SEE US AT SCHOOL.

13:55.465 --> 13:58.838
I WAS JUST SO WORRIED
ABOUT HOW GINNY AND JOE
WERE TAKING THE BREAK-UP.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.611
GINNY AND JOE
ARE MADE UP.
THEY MADE UP?

14:01.611 --> 14:04.174
THAT'S GREAT.

14:04.174 --> 14:07.847
THOSE TWO CRAZY KIDS
DESERVE A CHANCE.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.050
STAN, YOU'VE GOTTA
ACCEPT THAT WE'RE GOING
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY NOW.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.182
YOU CAN'T BE HANGING
AROUND HERE SO MUCH.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.124
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK I'M HANGING
AROUND SO MUCH?

14:19.029 --> 14:22.532
THEY'RE NUDES,
BUT THEY'RE TASTEFUL.

14:26.296 --> 14:30.240
AVERY? IS THAT LUMP
UNDER THE COVERS YOU?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.641
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
STAN?

14:31.641 --> 14:34.074
WELL, THE LUMP IS ABOUT
YOUR SIZE AND SHAPE.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.977
AND HAS YOUR VOICE,
AND SMELLS LIKE YOU.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.379
SO, IT'S EITHER YOU
OR A DUCK.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.353
I DON'T EVER WANT TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

14:43.353 --> 14:47.918
BUT AVERY LOVES SCHOOL.
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH AVERY, DUCK?

14:47.918 --> 14:50.961
I'M THE SMALLEST KID
IN MY GRADE, STAN.

14:50.961 --> 14:53.293
I JUST DON'T FIT IN.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.595
AVERY, YOUR SIZE
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR WORTH.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
AM I WORTH MORE THAN
ONE OF THOSE LITTLE DOGS

14:57.597 --> 15:00.600
THAT WOMEN CARRY
IN THEIR PURSES?
YES, I AM.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.374
THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

15:04.374 --> 15:09.209
I AM THE PURSE DOG, STAN.
THIS BOY WES WON'T
EVEN TALK TO ME.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.580
BECAUSE OF YOUR HEIGHT?

15:10.580 --> 15:13.013
HE CALLED ME
A "LITTLE SIXTH GRADER"

15:13.013 --> 15:15.385
AND THEN TODAY
HE TOTALLY BLEW ME OFF.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.487
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT IF IT
WASN'T BECAUSE I'M SHORT?

15:17.487 --> 15:20.991
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

15:20.991 --> 15:24.224
THERE ARE TWO KINDS
OF PURSE DOGS:
SHIVERING OR VICIOUS.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.027
WHICH ONE ARE YOU,
AVERY?

15:27.027 --> 15:30.230
WELL, I AM A LITTLE
HIGH-STRUNG. I HAVE
A TENDENCY TO GET COLD.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.632
I EAT SMALL,
BUT FREQUENT, MEALS.
SAY "VICIOUS."

15:32.632 --> 15:34.504
VICIOUS!
YEAH, YOU ARE.

15:36.066 --> 15:41.641
YEAH, I AM. AND I'M
GONNA GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.543
TOMORROW AT SCHOOL,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.375
I'M GOING TO TELL
HIM WHAT A JERK HE IS.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.677
HE'S THE ONE WHO
SHOULD FEEL BAD
ABOUT THIS, NOT ME.

15:47.677 --> 15:51.281
THATAGIRL!
OR PURSE DOG.
OR DUCK.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.983
OR WHATEVER YOU ARE.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.031
HEY, AVERY.
YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING

16:01.031 --> 16:02.592
SOME ISSUES
WITH YOUR BODY.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.534
( chuckles)
NOW...

16:04.534 --> 16:07.597
I KNOW HER APPROACH
MAY HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE OFF-PUTTING.

16:07.597 --> 16:13.643
BUT LUCKY FOR YOU,
I HAVE HARRIET THE HIPPO.

16:13.643 --> 16:17.577
NOW, HARRIET'S HAS
HER INSECURITIES ABOUT
HER CHANGING BODY, TOO.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.311
I WONDER WHAT THEY--
( screaming )

16:22.552 --> 16:25.055
HARRIET,
YOU SCARE PEOPLE.

16:33.323 --> 16:36.596
MOMMY, I BELIEVED IN YOU.
AND THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.598
BELIEVED.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.232
DON'T TELL ME TODAY'S
LUNCH WAS NO GOOD, EITHER.

16:42.232 --> 16:45.335
I MADE YOU A VERY
NICE SANDWICH WITH
LEFTOVER CHICKEN.

16:45.335 --> 16:49.439
HOW CAN I TRADE THIS?
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

16:52.712 --> 16:58.348
ALL THE KIDS CALLED
IT THE "FALL APART
DISASTER STINK SANDWICH."

16:58.348 --> 17:01.491
THAT'S NOT EVEN CLEVER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WE'RE IN SECOND GRADE.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.594
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THIS IS A PROBLEM NOW.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.456
THIS WASN'T A PROBLEM
IN FIRST GRADE.

17:06.456 --> 17:10.230
IN FIRST GRADE,
WE'D EAT ANYTHING:
PASTE, MUD--

17:10.230 --> 17:12.132
TONY ATE HIS SHOELACES.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.505
WE HAD TO HAVE
AN ASSEMBLY ABOUT IT.

17:15.505 --> 17:20.340
BUT NOW WE'RE
IN SECOND GRADE--
EXCEPT FOR TONY.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.373
WE WANT SOMETHING GOOD.
I NEED SOMETHING
I CAN TRADE.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.215
WHAT DID AVERY
DO IN SECOND GRADE?

17:25.215 --> 17:26.416
SHE MADE HER OWN LUNCH.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.179
YEAH, I AM NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.223
FINE, SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT IN YOUR LUNCH TOMORROW?

17:33.223 --> 17:36.126
TEN DOLLARS.
YEAH, I AM NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.462
OH, HEY, AVERY. I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.094
AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
WEARING A HAT?

17:44.094 --> 17:45.395
IT CAN MAKE YOU
LOOK TALLER.

17:45.395 --> 17:47.066
NO, LINDSAY,
HATS ARE YOUR THING.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.338
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE

17:48.338 --> 17:49.669
TO BE THE ONE
TO SAY THAT.

17:51.341 --> 17:54.804
AND I REALIZED, IT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM. IT'S WES'S.

17:54.804 --> 17:56.576
AND IF HE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BECAUSE I'M SHORT,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.348
THEN HE'S A JERK--

17:58.348 --> 18:01.251
A DREAMY, HAZEL-EYED JERK.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.783
AND I'M GOING
TO TELL HIM THAT.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.555
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
MENTION HIS CHISELED JAW

18:05.555 --> 18:08.718
AND PERFECT HAIR.
THAT'LL GET HIM.

18:08.718 --> 18:11.261
ARE YOU SURE THIS
ISN'T JUST ALL
IN YOUR HEAD?

18:11.261 --> 18:12.592
MAYBE HE DOESN'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE SHORT.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.693
THEN WHY ELSE WOULD HE HAVE

18:13.693 --> 18:15.325
BLOWN ME OFF LIKE
THAT YESTERDAY?

18:15.325 --> 18:18.498
UGHH. THIS GROSS
PIMPLE WILL NOT GO AWAY.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.831
I DON'T WANT ANY
GIRLS LOOKING AT ME
UNTIL IT'S GONE.

18:21.831 --> 18:24.204
UH, SORRY,
NOT NOW.

18:25.235 --> 18:26.506
STUPID PIMPLE.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.807
HEY, WESS.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.479
I KNOW WHY YOU
WON'T LOOK AT ME,

18:29.479 --> 18:30.610
AND IT'S DISGUSTING!

18:30.610 --> 18:33.483
YOU ARE A REPULSIVE PERSON
AND YOU MAKE ME SICK.

18:33.483 --> 18:37.217
IT'S JUST A PIMPLE.
IT'LL GO AWAY!

18:37.217 --> 18:39.349
WAIT! PIMPLE?
WHAT PIMPLE?

18:39.349 --> 18:40.390
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PIMPLE!

18:40.390 --> 18:41.821
SORRY!
I KEEP SAYING PIMPLE.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.324
AHH!

18:44.324 --> 18:46.456
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

18:46.456 --> 18:48.428
PIMPLE.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.530
I REALLY BLEW IT WITH HIM.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.403
I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS
LOOKING AT ME DIFFERENTLY
BECAUSE OF MY SIZE,

18:53.403 --> 18:56.236
BUT MAYBE IT REALLY
WAS ALL IN MY HEAD.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.509
JUST LIKE PROBABLY
NO ONE EVEN NOTICED
WES'S PIMPLE.

18:59.509 --> 19:01.341
HEY, MAYBE IT'S THE SAME
WITH YOUR HAIR.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.642
WHAT ABOUT MY HAIR?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.674
I MEAN, MAYBE NO ONE
ELSE WILL THINK IT'S
AS BAD AS YOU DO.

19:04.674 --> 19:06.876
OH, NO. IT'S BAD.

19:06.876 --> 19:09.419
BUT EVERYONE'S GOING
TO SEE IT AT SOME POINT,

19:09.419 --> 19:12.222
SO I MIGHT AS WELL USE
THAT TO DO SOME GOOD.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.524
HEY, PIMPLE BOY.

19:15.885 --> 19:19.158
HEY, MAN. DON'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT MY SISTER SAID.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.530
WE ALL HAVE OUR
HIDEOUS FLAWS.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.363
AT LEAST YOURS DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE THIS...

19:25.195 --> 19:29.339
( applause )

19:29.339 --> 19:31.601
( laughing )

19:31.601 --> 19:34.904
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY
IS SO MEAN!

19:36.376 --> 19:39.349
WELL, I THINK WE ALL
LEARNED SOMETHING HERE.

19:39.349 --> 19:43.483
THE AMAZINGNESS OF MY HAIR
WAS NEVER IN ITS LENGTH.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.316
YES.
THAT'S WHAT WE LEARNED.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.889
Stan: AVERY FIGURED OUT THAT
JUST 'CAUSE SHE WAS

19:49.889 --> 19:52.662
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING
DIDN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE ELSE

19:52.662 --> 19:54.864
WAS LOOKING AT IT
THE SAME WAY.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.496
AND I FIGURED SOMETHING OUT,
TOO,

19:56.496 --> 19:58.368
THANKS TO A LITTLE HELP
FROM TYLER.

19:58.368 --> 20:01.701
HERE, STAN.
WHENEVER YOU MISS US,
YOU JUST PLAY WITH THESE.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.505
THANKS, TYLER.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.607
OH, AND THE GOOD NEWS
IS THEY'RE NOT
MADE OF CHEESE,

20:07.607 --> 20:09.539
SO YOU WON'T EAT THEM.

20:09.539 --> 20:12.782
NEVER ASSUME A DOG WON'T
EAT SOMETHING.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.418
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE A SPRING.
WHEN I POOP THAT OUT,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.820
I HOPE IT DOESN'T
BOUNCE BACK IN.

20:27.897 --> 20:30.360
GUESS WHAT THEY
CALLED MY LUNCH TODAY?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.961
A REUBEN SANDWICH.

20:31.961 --> 20:34.604
NAMED AFTER A REALLY
SMELLY KID NAMED REUBEN

20:34.604 --> 20:38.708
WHO WEARS HIS UNDERWEAR
ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS.

20:38.708 --> 20:43.573
CHLOE, I REALLY UPPED
MY GAME AND MADE YOU
AN AMAZING LUNCH.

20:43.573 --> 20:46.976
IF YOU CAN EAT THIS,
I'LL STOP COMPLAINING.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.548
BENNETT, COME HERE.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.850
LET'S SHOW CHLOE WHAT
A GREAT SANDWICH THIS IS.

20:52.021 --> 20:54.784
ME?

20:54.784 --> 20:58.558
YOU EAT HALF, I'LL EAT HALF.
SUPPORT ME ON THIS.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.989
WELL,
I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU,

20:59.989 --> 21:02.392
BUT I HAVE AN ABNORMALLY
STRONG GAG REFLEX.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.464
YOU'RE BEING DRAMATIC--
I DON'T WANT
TO THROW UP--

21:04.464 --> 21:06.736
( arguing )

21:06.736 --> 21:08.498
EAT IT!
OKAY!

21:08.498 --> 21:10.640
OKAY.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.872
I CAN DO THIS.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.977
( gagging )

21:17.977 --> 21:20.550
COME ON,
IT IS NOT SO--

21:20.550 --> 21:24.053
( indistinct )
OH!

21:24.053 --> 21:26.956
KEEP GOING. IT GETS WORSE.

21:26.956 --> 21:28.518
( crunching sound )

21:28.518 --> 21:30.390
THAT'S CARTILAGE.

21:31.421 --> 21:34.524
( mumbling )

21:34.524 --> 21:36.426
THERE. GOOD.

21:36.426 --> 21:38.027
MMMM. GOOD.

21:38.027 --> 21:39.699
NOW THE POTATO SALAD.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.631
TOMORROW I'LL PUT
TEN DOLLARS IN YOUR LUNCH.

21:41.631 --> 21:43.933
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

21:46.476 --> 21:47.777
( springing noise )

21:47.777 --> 21:50.840
Man: OH, NOT THE SPRING!
I WAS AFRAID OF THAT.
