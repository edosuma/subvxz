you took two sides of the triangle, brah.

Carrollton to Esplanade, what you needed to
do was just go down the one side.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.686
-What?
-C|aiborne.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.150
Claiborne is the hypotenuse
of the triangle, see?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.189
What?

00:26.277 --> 00:28.643
The hypotenuse of the triangle that we was in.

New Orleans is crescent-shaped,

that it's about New Orleans
and to reference Katrina.

a moment ago at the bar

and he gave me one of them
Wynton compliments, you know?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.882
Called it an "interesting amalgam,

"not quite jazz, but intriguing for what it is."

Delmond, you told me when you started this,

10:46.438 --> 10:49.020
jazz literati are gonna hate it

10:49.107 --> 10:52.520
almost as much as some of the
Mardi Gras Indians are going to resent it.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.237

come up here for the release.

"Who the hell cares what anybody thinks?"
He can do that.

Matter of fact, the other day, I went with him
to an Indian council meeting

11:05.290 --> 11:08.248
and most of the other chiefs,
they were cool, you know,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.871
but a couple of them
started dogging the music,

11:09.962 --> 11:12.499
saying we were messing with the tradition.

-RANDALL: Where was it at?
-Under your bed.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.710
LARRY: LaDonna.

13:17.839 --> 13:18.999
(BEEPING STOPS)

13:21.343 --> 13:24.130
RANDALL: Please?
ALCIDE: No.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.759
RANDALL: Why not?
LaDONNA: Oh, man.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.803
What's up?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.134
Did you fill out that permission slip?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.969
-The one for Randall?
-Oh, shit.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.179
RANDALL: I don't break stuff.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.683
I mean...

13:37.567 --> 13:39.819
Sorry, Victorine.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.441
Living in closer quarters like this,

13:43.699 --> 13:47.317
it would probably be better
if everyone dressed before breakfast.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.697
Victorine, we're all family here.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.744
I don't think she needs you to tell her...

13:51.832 --> 13:54.164
LaDONNA: No. Uh-uh.
She got a point.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.458
Though in this case,
after Larry gets the boys off to school,

13:57.546 --> 13:59.628
I'm going back to bed.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.752
LaDonna closed last night,
didn't get home till 2:00.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.334
Oh, of course. Your bar.

-LARRY: She'll sign it tomorrow.

MAN ON PA: Officer Dalmadge,
please report to the warden's office.

14:21.153 --> 14:24.520
Officer Dalmadge,
please report to the warden's office.

14:27.451 --> 14:31.444
Man, I can't get some of my own people
to make this ride, but here you are.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.993
A friend's a friend. That's my motto.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.460
-That's your motto?
-I got a bunch of mottos.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.626
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
-I got mottos for every situation.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.298
-Thirty-seven months, huh?
-Yeah.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.044
Could have got less if you'd have cooperated.
That's what people say.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.139
But you didn't.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.933
So you drove all the way up here
from New Orleans to ask me why...

14:56.021 --> 14:59.013
Flew in from Dallas, actually. I've been home.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.439
All right, flew in from Dallas to Atlanta

15:01.526 --> 15:03.812
to ask poor old incarcerated Oliver Thomas

15:03.904 --> 15:07.738
why he wouldn't drop a dime
when the feds rolled him up, huh?

15:08.075 --> 15:11.067
Well, that, and I want to ride Zulu again.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.527
-(CHUCKLES)
-So I figured I'd ask you about that, too.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.279
Yeah.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.240
You're not cooperating, right?

15:19.961 --> 15:22.373
I guess I just didn't want
to play the game anymore.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.671
And I'll do the time I deserve to do.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.170
'Cause I did what I did, sorry for that.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.676
Let a lot of people down.

15:31.473 --> 15:36.137
As to whoever did what else,
that's between them and their conscience.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.186
MAN ON PA: Officer Dalmadge,
please report to the warden's office.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.311
Be that as it may, I've kept every promise
that I've made to you, Lieutenant.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.187
Yes, sir.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.690
Six months ago, I transferred you to Homicide

15:47.823 --> 15:51.441
with the promise that Captain Guidry
would not be your problem.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.615
Yes, sir.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.784
And in the end,
it's Guidry that we transferred,

15:54.913 --> 15:56.619
and you're still there.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.207
Look, Chief, with all due respect,

16:01.211 --> 16:03.122
if Guidry had been doing his job,

16:03.213 --> 16:06.626
you'd be having this conversation with him
and I'd be out to pasture somewhere.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.465
Well, now it's time to let me go home.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.760
-Back to 8th District.
-Transfer you, too.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.428
That unit is full of Guidry's people.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.301
They resent that he's gone and I'm still there,

16:15.392 --> 16:19.476
and I cannot be effective in that environment.

16:19.938 --> 16:23.305
Says here that your shift's clearance rate
is twice that of the other two.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.518
Deputy, I am requesting a transfer.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.022
Denied.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.731
Terry, I need you where I have you.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.988
All right.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.035
If you want me to stay,

16:39.207 --> 16:40.617
I have one other request.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.750
-Fire away.
-Limit the details.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.997
Make eight hours a week the maximum
amount of secondary employment

16:48.091 --> 16:49.922
for Homicide detectives.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.342
You think the detectives resent you now?

16:52.429 --> 16:55.262
Imagine what it's like
I put a cap on secondary.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.096
But...

16:57.809 --> 17:00.221
Give me a chance to confer
with Captain Hardesty

17:00.312 --> 17:01.722
and the people in legal,

17:01.813 --> 17:04.190
and I'll have an answer for you by week's end.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.107
-l'm off till Friday.
-You are? Any plans?

17:07.235 --> 17:09.897
Yeah, I'm going to go visit my kids,
Indianapolis.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.066
Indianapolis?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.868
Just headed across the street there.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.158
My son was here?

17:21.249 --> 17:24.207
I thought they took him
out to St. Gabriel or someplace.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.543
Yeah, they did. The morgue here was flooded.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.087
So, no, Joey was never here.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.296
-This the guy's giving you a hard time, eh?
-Mmm-hmm.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.133
All right, let's go see this son of a bitch.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.055
Look,

17:40.143 --> 17:42.805
I would be happy to talk this over
with Dr. Minyard in person.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.603
Okay? The lawsuit would
not have been necessary in the first place...

17:45.690 --> 17:47.066
Dr. Minyard isn't available.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.732
Okay, can I leave my card again?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.730
Suing Dr. Minyard, are we?

17:51.821 --> 17:55.234
Afraid so, for public records.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.281
All my numbers are on the top sheet.
Thank you.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.158
-Good luck with it.
-Thanks.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.914
Hi.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.209
I'm Vincent Abreu. The father of Joey...

18:08.338 --> 18:10.579
Joseph. Joseph Abreu's my son.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.416
I had an appointment
with the doctor in charge here today.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.796
We weren't aware that Dr. Minyard

18:15.887 --> 18:18.219
had a meeting with anyone
other than the victim's family.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.339
No, this is my lawyer.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.344
Yes, but we were led to understand...

18:22.560 --> 18:24.346
To hell with it. Listen, who does he think...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.688
Listen...

18:26.189 --> 18:28.145
(CLEARS THROAT)
Minyard and I go way back,

18:28.233 --> 18:30.599
so if it makes him more comfortable
to not have me in the room,

18:30.694 --> 18:32.400
let's make him more comfortable.

18:32.737 --> 18:36.321
All right, just remember,
the document that we need is the day record.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.447
It's usually internal to the coroner's office,

18:38.535 --> 18:41.902
and it tells us where they picked the body up,
when, and who was there.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.072
And those are facts that we need to nail down.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.955
-So, remember, you want the day record.
-Day record, I got it.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.081
And he likes to think
he's doing right by the families.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.664
So if he balks, just make him feel guilty.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.382
He says no, I'll put him on his ass.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.752
Go easy. Frank's nearly 80.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.553
Put him on his wrinkled ass, then.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.629
(CHUCKLES)

19:03.810 --> 19:06.552
All right, then, it'sjust me.

would come home

19:48.605 --> 19:50.687
-That's my favorite.
-Thanks.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.106
-We play to please.
-It breaks my heart, in a good way.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.229
MAN: Breakin' hearts is what we do.
WOMAN: And mending them, too.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.686
Hey, if you think I'm paying for that,
if you put your lips on it...

19:57.781 --> 20:00.113

in the past three months?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.406
WOMAN: Aw, he's blushing.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.280
-Any requests?
-Do the Jimmie Rodgers one.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.113

20:08.208 --> 20:10.415

in Treme last night.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.208
What happened in Treme last night?

20:12.337 --> 20:13.326
Didn't you hear?

20:13.421 --> 20:16.458
Cops locked up the musicians
for playing a memorial.

We'll just figure it out as we go. How's that?

Okay.

25:14.639 --> 25:15.628
MAN 1 : Wow.

25:15.723 --> 25:18.009
MAN 2: Wow, look at that.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.389
1811.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.975
Yep, that's older than you, Jonathan.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.272
(GUESTS LAUGH)

25:28.111 --> 25:29.100
Wow.

25:32.115 --> 25:35.152
Hmm, I guess New York doesn't suck.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.945
Who knew?

25:39.080 --> 25:43.244
Enrico, your luggage must smell
very strange when you arrive at JFK.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.710
(GUESTS LAUGHING)

25:44.794 --> 25:48.082
Or maybe you have a friend
who is a diplomat? How do you get it all in?

25:48.172 --> 25:52.211
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

25:52.301 --> 25:53.802
Merci beaucoup, mon ami.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.717
(ALL LAUGH)

25:57.515 --> 25:58.630
Wow.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.090
(ALL LAUGHING)

26:02.270 --> 26:04.727
(SINGING) Now wipe your weary eyes
Mama, don't cry

26:04.814 --> 26:06.054
Mama, don't cry

26:06.149 --> 26:10.392
-Living in the street, living do or die
-Mama, don't cry

26:10.486 --> 26:14.479
Drugs and prostitution, people will die

26:14.574 --> 26:16.314
Mama, don't cry

26:16.409 --> 26:19.071
I say they say there's no
cure for AIDS, that's a lie

26:19.162 --> 26:21.153
Mama, don't cry

26:21.247 --> 26:25.240
-Ten years from now, where will I be?
-Mama, don't cry

26:25.334 --> 26:27.290
Will I shine like a star

26:27.378 --> 26:28.914
Bright as their eyes can see?

26:29.005 --> 26:30.085
Mama, don't cry

26:30.173 --> 26:32.164
Will I be kicking the breeze

26:32.258 --> 26:34.874
-Hanging on St. Phillip Street, y'all?
-Mama don't cry

26:34.969 --> 26:36.630
Or like I ask the 6th

26:36.721 --> 26:38.837
Come on and roll with me

26:40.475 --> 26:42.716
-Give me a dime
-I only got eight

26:42.810 --> 26:45.051
-Give me a dime
-I only got eight

26:46.022 --> 26:49.310
-Hey, remember where you found that, pal.
-Okay.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.606
Seriously.

26:50.693 --> 26:53.230
Rocks, you want coke
or you want dope?

26:53.321 --> 26:55.107
Mama, don't cry

26:55.198 --> 26:58.031
You want pills, you want weed
or you want speed?

26:58.409 --> 26:59.740
Ah.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.324
-For the park?
-Yeah, later, later.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.917
You wanna fill a club
for two or three months on a $10 cover?

27:10.004 --> 27:12.620
Get your ass locked up by the NOPD.

27:13.508 --> 27:15.544
That shit was legendary.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.802
-Legendary, huh?
-Yeah.

27:20.056 --> 27:23.048
Getting cuffed for playing music
on the streets of New Orleans?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.849
That shit's like Christ-like.

27:25.937 --> 27:28.223
ANDREWS: Y'all make some noise!

27:28.314 --> 27:29.724
(CROWD CHEERING)

27:45.873 --> 27:47.989
-Hey, Mark.
-Terry.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.791
-Boys are just finishing up breakfast.
-Great.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.878
-You get in okay?
-Yeah.

27:53.965 --> 27:55.171
Where you staying?

27:55.258 --> 27:57.590
Holiday Inn off of Wesleyan.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.042
Nice.

27:59.136 --> 28:02.344
Well, in New Orleans, I live in a trailer.

28:02.473 --> 28:03.929
Right, sorry.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.176
Hey.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.728
PETER: Hey, Dad.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.306
-Hey, Dad.
-Oh, hey.

28:14.277 --> 28:16.438
KAY: Hey, Terry. Glad you made it.

28:16.612 --> 28:17.567
Yeah.

28:17.655 --> 28:20.442
Boys, enjoy your day with your dad,

28:20.533 --> 28:24.025
and we'll all meet back here
for dinner, all right?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.611
-I gotta go. I'm late for work.
-Okay, all right.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.201
-Let's go.
-See you, Terry.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.657
See you.

28:32.879 --> 28:33.994
So...

28:34.881 --> 28:36.963
What's fun in Indianapolis?

28:38.134 --> 28:41.592
I looked him in the eye.
He's not talking to the feds.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.966
And if he was, do you think he'd tell you?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.594
Do you think he'd say,
"Why, yes, Nelson, I gave them your name

28:47.685 --> 28:50.643
"and two dozen others
and all the papenNork I could lay hands on"?

28:50.730 --> 28:52.470
It's been months.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.476
I have to be cautious.

28:54.692 --> 28:55.898
It's a shame.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.725
There's a lot of work still
to be done in this town.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.233
That's so true, and I could use you.

29:01.324 --> 29:04.908
Right now, I'm part of this group working with
the Hyatt Regency people out of Chicago,

29:04.994 --> 29:07.576
raising money for a national jazz center.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.905
It means moving city hall to a new location,
but if we do it right,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.039
there's a chance to monetize the culture
down here in a very smart civic way.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.005
That sounds great.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.580
Trying to sort out the real estate issues now.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.757
Irvin Mayfield's on board.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.252
The trumpeter? I saw him play.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.053
Good man, Irvin.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.389
Come on. Put me in, Coach.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.512
Not now. Not yet.

29:39.654 --> 29:43.772
It's a little boat, baby
Enough room for you and me

29:45.201 --> 29:46.816
When the water comes to meet us

29:46.911 --> 29:49.402
We'll float on out to sea...

29:49.497 --> 29:50.657
Come on, man. You.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.785
-Well, they all evacuatin'

30:07.974 --> 30:09.430
Yeah, man, that's it.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.179
Sounds like some funny stuff.

30:12.269 --> 30:15.136
Yeah, funny but deep, brah.

30:15.231 --> 30:18.394

30:32.248 --> 30:33.658
You're back.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.159
Quick visit.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.668
-Where's Annie?
-Lafayette, she's got a gig tonight.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.005
But...

30:41.340 --> 30:44.127
Mr. Henry, my good friend Janette.

30:44.218 --> 30:47.506
I was spending the afternoon
engaged in some songsmithery.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.461
Wow, "Frogman" Henry, it's an honor.

30:49.557 --> 30:53.049
-My pleasure meeting you. Great.
-Excuse us a minute.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.352
In my living room by my piano,
Mr. Clarence "Frogman" Henry.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.476
-You are my witness.
-I am.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.933
Well, I'll leave you to it, just give me the mail.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.610
-All but thejunk.
-Thank you.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.186
Um...

31:06.282 --> 31:08.022
Ah, yes!

31:08.617 --> 31:09.868
Insurance check?

31:09.952 --> 31:11.863
Road Home money.

31:11.954 --> 31:14.115
Actually, a notice of my closing date.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.742
Sold out to Road Home, huh?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.824
Well, I got what I could, Davis.

31:19.754 --> 31:22.086
Hmm, I'm in New York now.

31:29.138 --> 31:30.753
And march!

31:30.848 --> 31:32.213

31:32.308 --> 31:35.721
No, keep going. There, that's it.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.847

31:37.938 --> 31:39.394
Wait, wait. Hold on.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.063
You're supposed to turn the other way.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.515
(VOCALIZING)

31:42.610 --> 31:45.226
Yeah, now, turn, turn.

Turn, left, left.

31:48.365 --> 31:49.696
Your other left.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.901
Step, keep going. Keep it going, that's it.

31:52.995 --> 31:54.781
Make sure... No, no, don't come over here.

31:54.872 --> 31:57.705
Why you coming over here,
when the band going that way?

31:57.792 --> 31:59.703
Where you going?
Where y'all going? Go that...

31:59.794 --> 32:02.627
Don't you walk...
You going to walk right in front of me?

Hello?

32:08.469 --> 32:10.130
Alison?

32:10.221 --> 32:12.963
Uh, no, I don't think so.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.764
Oh, my assistant must still
be at lunch, I'm sorry.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.637
Is this a bad time for you?

32:17.728 --> 32:20.845
-From the coroner's office, right?
-Right.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.393
And you're Toni Bernette.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.517
If I'd have known,
I would have said something yesterday.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.943
I'm L.P. Everett. I'm a reporter.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.270
With Who?

32:29.365 --> 32:31.401
Uh, it's hard to say.

32:31.492 --> 32:33.608
I'm kind of working
for the investigative reporting program

32:33.702 --> 32:35.488
at the grad school out of UC Berkeley,

32:35.579 --> 32:37.956
but they kind of ran out of funding, so...

32:38.040 --> 32:40.031
I might be down here
with The Nation magazine

32:41.627 --> 32:43.413
So you're not local.

32:43.504 --> 32:44.994
Um...

32:45.756 --> 32:47.542
Well, I like the food, anyway.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.999
(CHUCKLES)

32:58.352 --> 33:00.513
Boy, I thought we got rid of you.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.517
There's still cash in the streets here, son.
I'm just getting started.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.066
So what? You back on the tit
with your FEMA boys or what?

33:08.154 --> 33:11.396
Not yet, but I see you still got work.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.026
What's the game nowadays?

33:13.117 --> 33:14.323

out this Florida lady who got the connect.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.963

Your guys can't do better than that?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.260
Man, I'm demo and hauling, me.

33:35.347 --> 33:39.716
This clever bitch got us out here
pretending to do the work on this one.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.597
Another two,
she ain't got us doing nothing at all.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.311
Pretending?

33:44.398 --> 33:47.265
Cheap door, some paint, cut the grass.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.769
Bullshit only.

33:48.861 --> 33:52.570
You walk inside,
the whole damn place rotted out.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.030
You got a name, address for the lady?

33:55.117 --> 33:57.073
I got an address over on Howard,

33:57.161 --> 33:59.652
but it ain't nothing
but an office with a secretary.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.915
I wanna connect with her,

34:02.541 --> 34:03.826
I call her.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.411
I need to start voting Republican and shit.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.962
-(DIALING)
-Vote your conscience, son.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.300
You got a percentage?

34:15.429 --> 34:16.965
She pay by the house.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.763
With me, you got points. You know that.

34:22.811 --> 34:23.846
(ENGINE STARTS)

34:23.938 --> 34:25.644
Vigilante killings?

34:25.814 --> 34:27.099
In Algiers.

34:27.191 --> 34:30.399
That was the tip, anyway. Shootings of blacks
by white civilians during Katrina.

34:30.486 --> 34:33.444
So you sued the coroner for autopsy reports.
Which ones?

34:33.530 --> 34:36.192
I asked for autopsies
on every death in Orleans Parish

34:36.283 --> 34:38.524
from the date of the levee breaks
until the end of September.

34:38.744 --> 34:39.859
And?

34:39.954 --> 34:41.615
-Dr. Minyard refused.
-(CHUCKLES)

34:41.705 --> 34:43.411
So I filed suit three months ago,

34:43.499 --> 34:46.582
state judge found in our favor
and, eventually,

34:46.669 --> 34:49.285
I get the autopsies
from the time period in question,

34:49.380 --> 34:50.836
except for any deaths

34:50.923 --> 34:53.710
from gunshots,
knife wounds or blunt-force trauma.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.213
What they sent me was whitewashed.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.090
Have you ever been to New Orleans before,
Mr. Everett?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.466
No.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.679
Well, welcome to another world.
(CHUCKLES)

35:08.023 --> 35:09.763
lwas told that I should look you up.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.225
That you've been doing
civil rights work since the '80s.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.274
A long time to be ignored, I know.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.401
Ahem, um...

35:19.410 --> 35:22.698
I'm wondering if you know anyone
in the black community over in Algiers.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.578
I mean, if the coroner won't
give me the autopsies,

35:25.666 --> 35:28.624
there's always another way
to skin the cat, right?

35:28.711 --> 35:32.044
I haven't had a case over there
in a decade, but...

35:32.214 --> 35:35.832
I do know a guy that grew up in the
Fischer Projects over there on the Westbank.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.791
He's a good investigator.

35:37.886 --> 35:38.966
Okay.

35:40.723 --> 35:41.963
I'll have him get in touch with you.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.139
-Thank you so much.
-You bet.

Which I wanted to get on today,

35:59.742 --> 36:01.983
because Benny's been ailing since his stroke.

36:02.077 --> 36:05.410
And between y'all and me,
I was hoping that he might be around

36:05.497 --> 36:08.989
to where he be one participating in what
is becoming known around town as

36:09.084 --> 36:10.870
"The Opus Without Pity,"

36:10.961 --> 36:13.122
a work most definitely in progress.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.999
"Oh, no," I hear you saying,

36:15.090 --> 36:18.708
"Davis, please, mother of God, say it isn't so!"

36:22.681 --> 36:23.841
It's so.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.139
I've already signed up A! Johnson,
"Frogman" Henry,

36:26.226 --> 36:28.012
and I'm coming after Benny and Irma next.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.766
Yes, the great voices
of New Orleans' rhythm and blues

36:31.857 --> 36:34.439
will speak to our current
sociopolitical contretemps

36:34.526 --> 36:36.107
in a way that only they can,

36:36.195 --> 36:38.902
making Puccini my bitch in the process.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.366
Hey.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.613
Yes, music lovers,
"Katrina: An Opera in Blues and Funk."

36:44.745 --> 36:46.531
And to help fund this essential project,

36:46.622 --> 36:48.988
please allow me to shill
for my other current endeavor,

36:49.083 --> 36:51.199
McAlary's Musical Heritage Tours,

36:51.293 --> 36:52.999
Tuesdays and Thursdays, noon and 3:00.

36:53.087 --> 36:54.873
Starting on Rampart and Dumaine.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.544
All proceeds benefiting the opera.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.418
So please tell your friends, tell your family,

36:58.509 --> 37:01.251
but most importantly, tell the tourists.

37:07.142 --> 37:10.225
Okay, well, I'm DJ Davis

37:10.437 --> 37:13.053
sitting in for Judy Wood on the day shift.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.015
We have a fresh release
from Delmond Lambreaux

37:16.151 --> 37:18.813
and his father Big Chief Albert Lambreaux
of the Guardians,

37:18.904 --> 37:22.738
taking that Indian thing
to where it never dared go before.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.363
(SONG PLAYING)

37:29.665 --> 37:31.201

(POWER SAW WHIRRING)

37:45.848 --> 37:47.554
(SONG PLAYING ON RADIO)

37:55.315 --> 37:56.930
You know who y'all listening to?

37:58.193 --> 37:59.182
Que?

37:59.653 --> 38:01.518
On that radio there.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.860
Turn that up.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.238
(VOLUME INCREASES)

38:14.042 --> 38:15.498
That's me!

38:16.295 --> 38:17.626
Right there!

38:17.713 --> 38:19.123
Ese viejo esta loco.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.294
(LAUGHS)

38:20.382 --> 38:21.792
"Loco," shit!

38:21.884 --> 38:25.172
That's me on your radio.
And that right there?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.469
(TRUMPET PLAYING)

38:28.557 --> 38:30.673
That's my son on that horn.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.428
(LAUGHS)

38:32.519 --> 38:34.055
(COUGHS)

38:39.318 --> 38:42.776
Sonny, you come for dinner tonight?

38:42.905 --> 38:44.486
Well, actually...

38:48.076 --> 38:51.534
Actually, lwas thinking
I might take Linh to this restaurant...

38:51.747 --> 38:53.954
Real nice place. Clancy's.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.532
-In New Orleans?
-Yeah, uptown.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.291
It's a real nice place. Ijust thought...

38:58.378 --> 39:01.461
No, no, no. It too long to ride to New Orleans.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.000
It 5:00 now.

39:03.091 --> 39:06.800
By the time you change your clothes,
get clean and go, you have no time.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.429
You have to bring Linh right back. Crazy.

39:10.933 --> 39:13.470
Mr. Tran. Linh, me,

39:13.560 --> 39:15.096
we've been going out for months now.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.224
Okay, for you tonight, restaurant, okay?

39:18.315 --> 39:20.647
Dong Phuong. I treat.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.608
I'm saying they locked me up, too,

39:27.991 --> 39:29.606
and nobody even know.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.816
Ain't that a mess?

39:30.911 --> 39:33.698
You gonna sit there and pout,
because Glen David and Derrick

39:33.789 --> 39:36.622
took a charge for playing in the street
and no one talking about you? For real?

39:36.792 --> 39:37.872
I'm just saying.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.370
Well, I'm just saying,

39:39.461 --> 39:43.374
Glen and Derrick, they ain't neither of them
the assistant band director at Elie.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.251
And how you think it would
look to the school

39:45.342 --> 39:48.926
if you got locked up for giving the finger
to the police all disorderly-like?

39:49.263 --> 39:51.720
Don't look now, Antoine,
but you becoming a grown-up.

39:51.807 --> 39:52.796
(SCOFFS)

39:52.891 --> 39:54.506
And you need
to be carrying it like a grown-up.

39:54.601 --> 39:58.139
I ain't no grown-up.
I'm a musician, God damn it.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.473
Oh, yeah.

40:00.691 --> 40:03.603
BARACK OBAMA ON TV:
...because the legacy of their sacrifice...

40:04.903 --> 40:08.395
You know, Glen, Derrick and the Fraziers?

40:08.532 --> 40:10.818
They're gonna be in the Treme
tomorrow night

40:10.909 --> 40:12.240
and playing for Ken/vin again.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.783
DESIREE: You ain't gonna be there.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.121
Desiree.

40:15.205 --> 40:18.197
You the assistant band director.
You making a steady wage.

40:18.292 --> 40:21.079
You ain't getting locked up, Antoine.
(HUFFS)

40:22.629 --> 40:24.085
(MUTTERS)

40:24.172 --> 40:27.380
Get my ass locked up
any damn time I feel like it.

40:27.843 --> 40:29.128
Yeah.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.632
America had not made the right choice
over the easy choice.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.183
Mark's a good guy.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.013
Boys and him get along?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.860
Yeah, they're fine.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.279
So... Colts are looking good this year.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.355
(KAY SCOFFS)

40:53.827 --> 40:56.193
And you got that car race, right?

40:58.373 --> 41:00.864
So how's the sorghum coming in?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.792
Come on, it's a place like any other.

41:05.297 --> 41:08.004
You never really took to New Orleans.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.052
Even before the flood.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.637
Didn't work for you, did it?

41:14.056 --> 41:15.341
Dreamers.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.422
Dreamers and drunks.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.433
I don't think I'm either.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.387
Well, maybe you're in the wrong place, then.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.775
Listen, Terry,

41:26.777 --> 41:28.438
I've been thinking that,

41:28.528 --> 41:31.656
until you're out of that trailer
and back in your house,

41:31.740 --> 41:33.856
I don't think the boys
should be staying there.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.817
Why not? It's a trailer.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.324
It's like camping out or something.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.950
I saw a report

41:41.041 --> 41:44.033
that all the FEMA trailers have formaldehyde.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.622
People are getting sick, Terry.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.341
(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)

42:02.938 --> 42:04.098
Sonny.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.516
You need to drive back now?

42:09.611 --> 42:12.273
It's crazy. Living in another century.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.985
It's very different for you, I know.

42:16.076 --> 42:18.488
If I don't get you back home in like an hour,

42:18.578 --> 42:21.866
he'll get back in that car,
start rolling around the village looking for me.

42:21.957 --> 42:23.288
An hour after that,

42:23.375 --> 42:27.618
every able-bodied Vietnamese fisherman
in Versailles will be hunting us.

42:30.841 --> 42:32.081
(HORN HONKS)

42:43.520 --> 42:45.806
Go to the canal? See the birds?

42:46.273 --> 42:48.013
That was last night.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.640
Let's go down Chef Menteur.

42:50.736 --> 42:52.317
We can watch the traffic light change.

42:52.404 --> 42:53.393

43:14.426 --> 43:16.667
Well, I'm not going to think.
(GIGGLES)

43:18.513 --> 43:21.380
There will be no thinking.

43:23.143 --> 43:25.885
We can talk about work.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.598
You could tell me about your adventures
in New York.

43:31.693 --> 43:32.978
We could.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.484
But I'm not going to.

43:36.865 --> 43:39.197
I just want to lay around.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.367
When's your flight?

43:47.042 --> 43:48.578
8:00 tomorrow.

43:56.885 --> 43:59.547
-I like it.
-You got used to wearing it long.

43:59.638 --> 44:02.550
Yeah, I'm glad we decided to keep it.

44:02.641 --> 44:06.099
-Sofia? Did you like what we did last time?
-Sure.

44:07.020 --> 44:10.228
Do you think you could make it
so it's kind of not a hairstyle?

44:10.816 --> 44:12.226
Excuse me?

44:12.317 --> 44:13.432
SOFIA: Something that says,

44:13.527 --> 44:16.564
"I'm not styling my hair. Ijust am."
You know?

44:17.155 --> 44:19.646
Like, "This is me just hanging out,

44:19.741 --> 44:22.858
"not pretending to anything
other than what's real."

44:22.953 --> 44:26.571
Well, well.
That coffee shop must be deep in the Bywater.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.701
It's worse than that, Jay.

44:28.792 --> 44:31.579
Her boyfriend's a musician down there.

at all the vintage stores.

Up and down Decatur Street.

44:41.429 --> 44:45.547

something out of a Steinbeck novel.

Thanks, Heather.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.853
Have you met him?

44:48.937 --> 44:52.304
No, I keep stopping in for coffee,
hoping to catch a glimpse,

44:52.524 --> 44:54.890
but so far I've been shutout.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.809
When are you having him to dinner, Sof?

44:57.904 --> 45:00.520

-J&M Record Shop.

45:22.345 --> 45:25.007
Cosimo Matassa opened
a studio here in the '40s,

45:30.520 --> 45:35.514
This place turned out more hits
than any other studio in the country.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.106
Good Rockin' Tonight,

45:37.193 --> 45:39.024
all the Fats Domino stuff,

45:39.112 --> 45:41.774
Little Richard, Ray Charles...

45:41.865 --> 45:43.696
It's a Laundromat.

45:44.492 --> 45:45.618
Clearly.

45:45.702 --> 45:47.408
But when you go inside

45:47.495 --> 45:49.531
and you stand next to the change machine,

45:50.874 --> 45:52.489
you are more or less on the spot

45:52.584 --> 45:55.826
where Earl Palmer laid down
the backbeat that changed the world.

45:55.921 --> 45:58.003
But it's just a laundry now.

45:58.131 --> 46:00.213
With a built-in daiquiri stand.

46:00.300 --> 46:01.585
Questions? No? Great.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.133
Let's cross the threshold and partake.

-Hey.

46:17.609 --> 46:19.099
-I got all the trim I need.
-(PATRONS LAUGH)

46:19.194 --> 46:21.810
Hey, what up, Anthony?
How you moms and them, man?

46:21.905 --> 46:23.645
We'd complain, but who would listen?

46:23.740 --> 46:25.355
ALL: Yeah. All right.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.566
This is my friend Louis.
Louis, meet the wise men of Algiers.

46:27.744 --> 46:28.779
How's it going, guys?

46:28.870 --> 46:30.952
ANTHONY: Don't nothing happen
this crew don't know about.

46:31.039 --> 46:34.452
Okay, do me a favor, though.
Call me L.P. I don't really like Louis.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.828
-Ah, no problem, Lou.
-(PATRONS LAUGH)

46:37.879 --> 46:40.291
Don't get to harvest
that kind of crop too often.

46:40.382 --> 46:41.542
Right.

46:41.716 --> 46:43.217
So how about them 'aints?

46:43.468 --> 46:45.004
ALL: (GROANING) Oh, man.

46:45.095 --> 46:46.631
Same old Saints, man.

46:46.721 --> 46:50.054
-Yeah, the Saints for lack of season.
-I don't know.

Nice to meet you.

46:57.649 --> 47:01.392
Gaze, if you will,
at the grounds of Armstrong Park,

47:01.486 --> 47:04.444
home to Congo Square,

47:04.614 --> 47:06.320
where, basically,

47:06.408 --> 47:09.491
any American music
worth talking about comes from.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.988
Syncopated rhythms, call and response,

47:14.082 --> 47:16.619
the blue notes of West African slaves

47:16.751 --> 47:18.491
commingling on market days

47:18.586 --> 47:22.329
with the brass instrumentation
of the European musical heritage.

47:22.424 --> 47:25.086
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

47:26.219 --> 47:28.676
the birthplace ofjazz!

47:30.765 --> 47:32.756
Why don't we go there?

47:32.851 --> 47:34.682
Closed since the storm.

47:34.811 --> 47:37.928
You mean they can't manage
to clean up a park after two years?

47:38.023 --> 47:40.230
Dude, two years is but a

47:40.567 --> 47:42.398
twinkle in the eye of our civic leaders.

47:42.485 --> 47:43.816
We've only got a marker

47:43.903 --> 47:46.861
in the general vicinity
of Buddy Bolden's grave a few years back,

47:46.948 --> 47:48.813
and he's been gone
for more than half a century.

47:49.617 --> 47:50.948
So... Questions?

47:51.870 --> 47:53.781
Good. Let's sojourn uptown.

48:09.095 --> 48:11.882
-Nelson Hidalgo. Dallas, Texas.
-Nelson.

48:11.973 --> 48:15.591
You ever been here?
You sit, drink, and the bar spins.

48:15.685 --> 48:17.641
For real, once around every half hour.

48:17.729 --> 48:19.720
Are you with the government, Mr. Hidalgo?

48:20.607 --> 48:22.643
Do I look like I'm government?

48:23.526 --> 48:25.482
Are you with the RNC, then?

48:25.612 --> 48:28.570
(CHUCKLES) I paid those dues in Texas.

48:28.656 --> 48:31.147
Just like you paid them in Florida, I'm sure.

48:31.284 --> 48:33.070

So you're not with the government
and you're not from New Orleans.

48:40.710 --> 48:43.122
I'm a contractor, just like you.

48:43.213 --> 48:46.705

Mr. Hidalgo?

48:57.519 --> 49:00.101
ofjazz landmarks left on earth.

49:00.188 --> 49:03.430
Starting here, the Eagle Saloon,

49:03.566 --> 49:06.774
where Louis Armstrong's career began.

49:06.861 --> 49:09.773
He won a talent show here when he was a kid.

49:09.864 --> 49:12.276
He won that at the Iroquois Theater.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.694
No, I'm pretty sure it was here at the Eagle.

49:14.869 --> 49:17.736
That was when he put on make-up
and performed in whiteface.

49:17.831 --> 49:19.037
That was a theater.

49:19.124 --> 49:21.456
Why would there be
a children's talent show at a saloon?

49:21.543 --> 49:23.408
Oh, that's no problem in New Orleans.

49:23.628 --> 49:25.789
Kids in bars is one of our sacred traditions.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.461
This says it was the Iroquois Theater.

DAVIS: In any event!

49:29.217 --> 49:32.050
This area was called "Back 0' Town."

49:32.137 --> 49:35.425
Armstrong grew up on Perdido Street

49:35.557 --> 49:38.799
over there in a house

49:38.893 --> 49:41.054
that we tore down in the '60s.

49:42.063 --> 49:45.555
Did you people ever actually preserve
anything of note?

49:48.903 --> 49:50.985
-Preservation Hall.
-When was that founded?

49:51.072 --> 49:53.313
'60, '61, maybe?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.862
Really? That far back?

49:58.246 --> 49:59.702

Alcide, darling, I think you left
your salad fork in the potato server.

51:06.189 --> 51:07.679
You know, where I was raised,

51:07.774 --> 51:09.435
in the 6th Ward,

51:10.151 --> 51:14.144
we were taught that it was bad manners
to correct a guest for their manners.

51:14.239 --> 51:18.403
If they picked up the wrong fork
or poured beer into the wine glass,

51:18.826 --> 51:20.487
we were supposed to do the same.

51:21.996 --> 51:26.330
But in no way would we
be treating LaDonna like a guest.

51:26.918 --> 51:27.907
Oh.

51:28.836 --> 51:30.417
I'm family.

All right, then.

51:34.968 --> 51:36.504
Since I'm kin,

51:37.303 --> 51:42.138
I ain't gonna pay no never mind
to how I'm supposed to do.

51:43.476 --> 51:46.388
I'm guessing you don't have no malt liquor.

51:47.105 --> 51:48.891
Nothing in a 40, huh?

51:50.191 --> 51:52.273

What if he's a perv?

He's from New Orleans.
