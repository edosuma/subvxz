WEBVTT

00:01.792 --> 00:03.166
All right, Poopsie.

00:03.208 --> 00:04.667
A little exercise for you

00:04.709 --> 00:07.333
and then manicures

00:04.709 --> 00:07.333
for both of us!

00:08.709 --> 00:09.917
Ew.

00:09.959 --> 00:12.375
I wish you didn't always

00:09.959 --> 00:12.375
bury your toys, Poopsie.

00:12.417 --> 00:14.417
They get so...ew.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.083
Here we go. Fetch!

00:17.125 --> 00:18.709
( yaps )

00:21.709 --> 00:23.291
Okay, careful, Servo.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.583
There are people

00:23.333 --> 00:24.583
at the park,

00:24.625 --> 00:26.250
so only do

00:24.625 --> 00:26.250
what I tell you.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.750
It's not like when you

00:26.291 --> 00:28.750
were working with High Tide.

00:28.792 --> 00:31.834
Around humans, you need

00:28.792 --> 00:31.834
to act like a programmed robot.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.417
Follow my lead.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.875
Taking a robot dog

00:34.458 --> 00:36.875
for walkies?

00:36.917 --> 00:38.834
Ha. That's silly,

00:36.917 --> 00:38.834
isn't it?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.208
I mean, it doesn't

00:38.875 --> 00:41.208
need to-- Hm?

00:41.250 --> 00:42.667
Ha-ha. No, Mrs. Luskey.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.208
We're just passing through.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.208
Rescue business.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.709
Automotive incident.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.583
Traffic delay increasing.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.709
Awaiting instructions.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.125
Robot, move the car

00:54.750 --> 00:57.125
to the curb,

00:57.166 --> 00:59.542
then fix the flat.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.083
( beeps )

01:27.458 --> 01:29.625
Get it, Poopsie.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.625
( yapping )

01:32.625 --> 01:34.875
No! Poopsie!

02:23.500 --> 02:24.625
Bad girl.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.709
You nearly scared me to--

02:26.750 --> 02:29.000
Oh, who's my good girl?

02:29.041 --> 02:30.917
Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

02:30.959 --> 02:34.250
Thank you, Jody.

02:30.959 --> 02:34.250
And your robo-dog too.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.792
Did I say silly?

02:34.291 --> 02:36.792
I meant wonderful!

02:36.834 --> 02:39.834
How did it know

02:36.834 --> 02:39.834
to rescue Poopsie like that?

02:39.875 --> 02:43.208
I told him to.

02:39.875 --> 02:43.208
I mean, he's programmed to.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.875
And it's not Jody.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.875
It's Cody.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.834
And so helpful too.

02:50.875 --> 02:52.667
That's what you need,

02:50.875 --> 02:52.667
Poopsie.

02:52.709 --> 02:56.667
A robo-dog of your own,

02:52.709 --> 02:56.667
in case of emergencies.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.291
Come along, Poopsie.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.667
Baby's had enough excitement

02:58.333 --> 03:00.667
for one day,

03:00.709 --> 03:02.291
and so has Mama.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.750
Thanks again, Jody!

03:03.792 --> 03:06.750
It's...

03:03.792 --> 03:06.750
Bye, Mrs. Luskey.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.375
Nice job, Servo.

03:10.417 --> 03:11.583
( chuckles )

03:11.625 --> 03:13.583
And I think Poopsie likes you.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.500
Ew.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.333
Wish you guys could've

03:17.333 --> 03:19.333
seen him in action.

03:19.375 --> 03:22.500
He really saved the day

03:19.375 --> 03:22.500
and the mayor's dog.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.375
He returned

03:22.542 --> 03:24.375
the rubber bone too?

03:24.417 --> 03:25.875
Not a good idea.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.000
What was he supposed to do,

03:25.917 --> 03:28.000
keep it?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.917
What Heatwave means

03:28.041 --> 03:29.917
is that this type

03:29.959 --> 03:32.542
of sentient behavior

03:29.959 --> 03:32.542
from Servo could threaten

03:32.583 --> 03:35.250
the undercover status

03:32.583 --> 03:35.250
for all of us, correct?

03:35.291 --> 03:37.500
Yeah,

03:35.291 --> 03:37.500
but without all the big words.

03:37.542 --> 03:40.542
If we have to act

03:37.542 --> 03:40.542
like metal heads, so does he.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.583
Cody explained that Servo's

03:40.583 --> 03:43.583
programmed for rescue.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.000
Anyway,

03:43.625 --> 03:45.000
something tells me

03:45.041 --> 03:46.875
Mrs. Luskey didn't think

03:45.041 --> 03:46.875
about it too hard.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.667
Maybe, but Heatwave

03:46.917 --> 03:49.667
and Chase's concerns

03:49.709 --> 03:51.000
are still on target.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.583
Servo shouldn't be seen

03:51.041 --> 03:53.583
acting on his own

03:53.625 --> 03:56.625
unless it's a true emergency.

03:53.625 --> 03:56.625
It was, Dad.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.834
We couldn't just let

03:56.667 --> 03:58.834
the mayor's dog get run over.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.083
That is an emergency.

04:01.125 --> 04:04.083
An adorable,

04:01.125 --> 04:04.083
hairy little emergency.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.417
Bottom line:

04:04.125 --> 04:06.417
from now on, out in public,

04:06.458 --> 04:08.542
you're a robot

04:06.458 --> 04:08.542
that acts only on command.

04:08.583 --> 04:11.041
Got that?

04:08.583 --> 04:11.041
( beeps )

04:11.083 --> 04:13.041
I know you can do it, buddy.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.291
Cody and I will help you.

04:20.792 --> 04:23.458
MRS. LUSKEY:

04:20.792 --> 04:23.458
Poopsie, come see!

04:25.458 --> 04:27.834
Your new diamond collar

04:25.458 --> 04:27.834
just arrived.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.375
( baby-talk):

04:27.875 --> 04:30.375
We just love it, don't we?

04:27.875 --> 04:30.375
Yes, we do!

04:30.417 --> 04:32.667
Now let's get

04:30.417 --> 04:32.667
that nasty old one off.

04:32.709 --> 04:33.583
( whines )

04:34.667 --> 04:35.667
( phone rings)

04:37.458 --> 04:39.875
Hello? Oh, come home

04:37.458 --> 04:39.875
early today...

04:39.917 --> 04:42.625
HUXLEY ( on TV ):

04:39.917 --> 04:42.625
And in other news,

04:39.917 --> 04:42.625
what has four legs,

04:42.667 --> 04:44.959
changes flat tires,

04:42.667 --> 04:44.959
rescues dogs

04:45.000 --> 04:48.709
and is the latest member

04:45.000 --> 04:48.709
of Griffin Rock's Rescue Team?

04:48.750 --> 04:51.959
Say hello and "good boy"

04:48.750 --> 04:51.959
to Servo,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.125
the robotic mutt

04:52.000 --> 04:54.125
who just might be

04:54.166 --> 04:57.375
man's new best metallic friend.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.041
( whines )

04:59.083 --> 05:00.375
( sniffs )

05:06.417 --> 05:08.417
( mayor shouting indistinctly

05:06.417 --> 05:08.417
over phone )

05:11.125 --> 05:14.583
Mayor Luskey, please,

05:11.125 --> 05:14.583
you have to calm down so I--

05:14.625 --> 05:16.542
Calm down nothing!

05:16.583 --> 05:19.041
I've been the victim

05:16.583 --> 05:19.041
of a heinous crime.

05:19.083 --> 05:23.625
Poopsie's new collar stolen

05:19.083 --> 05:23.625
right out of my home!

05:23.667 --> 05:25.792
Are you sure

05:23.667 --> 05:25.792
you didn't misplace it?

05:25.834 --> 05:29.000
I don't see why anyone

05:25.834 --> 05:29.000
would steal a dog collar.

05:29.041 --> 05:34.041
Because it's encrusted

05:29.041 --> 05:34.041
with 27 diamonds, that's why!

05:34.083 --> 05:35.625
It's worth more than...

05:35.667 --> 05:36.917
( stammers )

05:36.959 --> 05:39.458
Than your monthly salary!

05:39.500 --> 05:41.542
We'll get right on it.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.542
( beeps )

05:41.583 --> 05:43.709
And I think I need a raise.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.583
CHIEF ( over intercom ):

05:46.041 --> 05:48.583
Team, we have a 459, B & E.

05:48.625 --> 05:52.542
No way! An actual B & E?

05:52.583 --> 05:54.417
Um, what's a B & E?

05:54.458 --> 05:57.500
Breaking and entering.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.500
Specifically in that order.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.166
Ugh. You'll need to finish up

05:57.542 --> 06:00.166
on your own.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.834
( groans )

06:09.125 --> 06:10.583
( whines )

06:10.625 --> 06:11.792
( growls )

06:14.875 --> 06:17.458
( Poopsie whines )

06:18.166 --> 06:20.083
( yaps )

06:33.917 --> 06:34.917
( beeps )

06:40.542 --> 06:41.750
( yaps )

06:46.542 --> 06:48.834
CHIEF:

06:46.542 --> 06:48.834
Well, the mayor

06:46.542 --> 06:48.834
won't be happy, but for now

06:48.875 --> 06:51.917
we'll have to file this one

06:48.875 --> 06:51.917
under "mission unaccomplished."

06:51.959 --> 06:54.792
Trying to find a missing

06:51.959 --> 06:54.792
dog collar in a town this size

06:54.834 --> 06:56.709
is about as easy as...

06:56.750 --> 06:59.542
Looking in Servo's mouth?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.625
Servo.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.792
What have you done?

07:11.792 --> 07:13.667
Chief Burns for the mayor.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.583
Yes, Mr. Alper, I'll hold.

07:15.625 --> 07:16.959
I can't believe it.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.041
We've been living

07:17.000 --> 07:19.041
with a thief under our noses

07:19.083 --> 07:20.834
this entire time.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.875
There has to be

07:20.875 --> 07:22.875
an explanation.

07:22.917 --> 07:26.709
So, what exactly have you two

07:22.917 --> 07:26.709
been teaching him, anyhow?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.542
Just to act like a robot.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.959
Sure didn't teach him

07:28.583 --> 07:29.959
to steal

07:30.000 --> 07:32.959
or-or even bury things

07:30.000 --> 07:32.959
like Earth dogs do.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.291
Would you care

07:33.000 --> 07:34.291
to make a statement?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.542
Though I must warn you,

07:34.333 --> 07:36.542
anything you bark or beep

07:36.583 --> 07:37.917
can and will be held

07:36.583 --> 07:37.917
against you.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.583
Now hang on there,

07:38.834 --> 07:40.583
Sherlocks.

07:40.625 --> 07:41.834
Just because

07:40.625 --> 07:41.834
he had the collar

07:41.875 --> 07:43.625
doesn't mean

07:41.875 --> 07:43.625
he stole the collar.

07:43.667 --> 07:47.125
In fact, he's got

07:43.667 --> 07:47.125
a water-tight alibi.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.250
GRAHAM:

07:47.166 --> 07:48.250
That's right.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.792
He was helping you

07:48.291 --> 07:49.792
with the drain pipe

07:49.834 --> 07:51.500
when the call came in.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.834
And Servo was with Cody and me

07:51.542 --> 07:54.834
the whole morning before that.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.709
( beeps )

07:55.750 --> 07:57.166
So he's not guilty!

07:57.208 --> 07:59.166
I'm so relieved.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.250
Yes, if you could just

07:59.208 --> 08:01.250
leave word with the mayor

08:01.291 --> 08:03.667
that the stolen item

08:01.291 --> 08:03.667
has been recovered.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.291
Thanks.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.417
I bet what happened

08:06.458 --> 08:09.083
was Servo got out

08:06.458 --> 08:09.083
and caught the thief.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.166
Or maybe he found

08:09.125 --> 08:11.166
the collar somewhere

08:11.208 --> 08:14.333
and thought burying it was

08:11.208 --> 08:14.333
the best way to keep it safe.

08:14.375 --> 08:18.000
Whatever the case, Servo

08:14.375 --> 08:18.000
was still acting on his own.

08:18.041 --> 08:20.000
If he can't learn

08:18.041 --> 08:20.000
to stop that behavior

08:20.041 --> 08:23.125
and does something

08:20.041 --> 08:23.125
to expose the team's secret,

08:23.166 --> 08:26.917
well, he might be better off

08:23.166 --> 08:26.917
back with High Tide.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.667
I know he'd take good care

08:28.208 --> 08:30.667
of you, but...

08:30.709 --> 08:32.542
I'd miss you, boy.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.208
( beeps )

08:41.917 --> 08:44.083
( doorbell rings )

08:47.291 --> 08:48.208
Ah!

08:48.250 --> 08:50.125
Excellent work, boys.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.583
And the thief is behind bars,

08:50.166 --> 08:53.583
I take it?

08:53.625 --> 08:56.917
Uh, well, we, uh, found

08:53.625 --> 08:56.917
the collar on the ground.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.375
Uh, perp probably

08:56.959 --> 08:58.375
just chucked it

08:58.417 --> 08:59.959
when he saw us on patrol.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.709
Wh-- Oh! Yes!

09:01.750 --> 09:04.834
That's exactly what happened.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.834
Just like Kade said.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.333
And he wouldn't lie, because

09:04.875 --> 09:07.333
Kade is as honest as--

09:07.375 --> 09:10.583
Ahem. We'll keep looking

09:07.375 --> 09:10.583
for the thief, Mayor Luskey.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.875
Poopsie's collar!

09:12.834 --> 09:15.875
Oh, how wonderful.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.792
( whimpers )

09:17.834 --> 09:19.250
( pants )

09:19.291 --> 09:23.750
( yapping )

09:27.417 --> 09:30.625
You have to get used to

09:27.417 --> 09:30.625
only following our commands.

09:30.667 --> 09:31.792
That'll convince

09:30.667 --> 09:31.792
other humans

09:31.834 --> 09:34.291
that you're just another robot.

09:31.834 --> 09:34.291
Watch us.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.375
Robot, touch your head.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.625
Robot, take two steps back.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.750
Now take two steps forward.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.166
Robot, take two steps forward.

09:50.417 --> 09:54.166
See? He obeys

09:50.417 --> 09:54.166
only when I say "robot."

09:54.208 --> 09:57.208
With you, the command

09:54.208 --> 09:57.208
will be "Bot-Dog." Got it?

09:58.792 --> 09:59.792
( beeps )

10:00.125 --> 10:02.333
Yeah, I know. It's embarrassing.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.291
But you get used to it.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.041
( cube humming )

10:10.083 --> 10:12.000
Ready? Fetch.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.792
Good, Servo!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.792
Way to pay attention.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.417
Okay, Bot-Dog, fetch!

10:26.166 --> 10:29.083
Robot, throw!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.166
( whispers ):

10:31.000 --> 10:32.166
Sorry.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.250
Bot-Dog, fetch!

10:34.291 --> 10:37.208
(  action theme playing  )

10:44.291 --> 10:46.125
( yaps )

10:47.500 --> 10:50.000
( beeps )

10:50.041 --> 10:54.041
( yapping )

10:57.834 --> 10:59.750
( whines )

11:14.208 --> 11:15.834
CODY:

11:14.208 --> 11:15.834
Bot-Dog, return!

11:15.875 --> 11:18.208
( beeps )

11:20.208 --> 11:22.792
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

11:31.208 --> 11:32.417
( brakes squeak )

11:32.458 --> 11:34.417
( thud )

11:37.500 --> 11:40.166
( in German accent ):

11:37.500 --> 11:40.166
Ah, the last piece

11:37.500 --> 11:40.166
of the puzzle.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.834
Ooh, finally our

11:40.208 --> 11:42.834
Tyrannosaurus skeleton

11:42.875 --> 11:44.041
will be complete.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.125
Bring it inside.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.333
( beeps )

12:07.375 --> 12:09.083
Where could he have gone?

12:09.125 --> 12:11.917
Bot-Dog, where are you?

12:11.959 --> 12:15.250
( growls )

12:15.291 --> 12:16.291
( beeps )

12:18.458 --> 12:19.917
( yaps )

12:32.458 --> 12:36.000
Ah! What have you done?

12:36.041 --> 12:38.375
( yaps )

12:42.458 --> 12:44.208
Um, did you happen

12:42.458 --> 12:44.208
to see a--

12:44.250 --> 12:46.125
It was that robo-dog!

12:46.166 --> 12:50.917
The one on the news.

12:46.166 --> 12:50.917
He destroyed our display!

12:50.959 --> 12:51.959
I'm sure he didn't--

12:52.041 --> 12:54.125
This was the mayor's

12:52.041 --> 12:54.125
pet project.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.166
Oh, wait till he hears

12:54.166 --> 12:57.166
about this!

12:59.333 --> 13:02.458
I can't believe Servo would

12:59.333 --> 13:02.458
do this. We have to find him.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.333
He could be anywhere by now.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.166
Let's head back

13:04.375 --> 13:06.166
to the firehouse.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.542
We can use

13:06.208 --> 13:07.542
the Energon Tracker.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.375
( Poopsie yaps )

13:17.375 --> 13:19.250
( beeps )

13:19.875 --> 13:20.875
( yaps )

13:32.166 --> 13:34.083
Oh, whoa. Oh!

13:56.208 --> 13:57.000
Hey!

13:57.041 --> 13:58.166
Come on!

13:57.041 --> 13:58.166
Aw, man!

13:58.208 --> 13:59.417
What are you doin'?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.458
CHIEF:

14:02.542 --> 14:04.458
I-I...I know. I know.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.375
Mr. Mayor,

14:04.500 --> 14:07.375
I'm sure it's just a glitch

14:07.417 --> 14:09.000
in the dog's programming.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.500
We are working on it.

14:10.542 --> 14:15.125
And nothing like this will

14:10.542 --> 14:15.125
ever happen again, I promise.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.625
HEATWAVE:

14:15.166 --> 14:16.625
Agh, what happened?

14:16.667 --> 14:18.250
The rest of us are

14:16.667 --> 14:18.250
out on a rescue,

14:18.291 --> 14:19.709
so you just let him

14:18.291 --> 14:19.709
run wild?

14:19.750 --> 14:22.542
No! H-He was doing really well.

14:22.583 --> 14:25.500
Then all of a sudden

14:22.583 --> 14:25.500
he just...ran away.

14:25.542 --> 14:28.375
Up till now,

14:25.542 --> 14:28.375
Servo's been really helpful.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.291
Right. Any tool you need,

14:28.417 --> 14:31.291
he's got it.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.375
And he's a zillion times better

14:31.333 --> 14:33.375
than a real dog.

14:33.417 --> 14:34.792
We don't have to

14:33.417 --> 14:34.792
feed him or--

14:34.834 --> 14:38.291
Servo is not a pet.

14:34.834 --> 14:38.291
He's a Cybertronian Helper Bot,

14:38.333 --> 14:40.125
and right now he's not helping.

14:40.166 --> 14:42.709
Indeed. His actions are

14:40.166 --> 14:42.709
putting us all in jeopardy.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.333
But--

14:42.750 --> 14:44.333
No buts.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.208
He's not more important

14:44.375 --> 14:46.208
than the team.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.041
And if he doesn't get that...

14:46.250 --> 14:48.041
( alarm sounding )

14:48.083 --> 14:49.917
There.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.917
That's his Energon signal.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.417
He just turned on Waverly.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.417
Headed toward the zoo.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.458
Maybe he just wants

14:54.458 --> 14:56.458
to see the monkeys.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.458
I'm sure he's not

14:56.500 --> 14:58.458
doing anything wrong.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.959
Dad, calls have been

14:58.500 --> 15:01.959
coming in non-stop.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.583
And there is some security

15:02.000 --> 15:05.583
footage you might want to see.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.667
I'm sorry, son.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.041
I think you know

15:12.709 --> 15:15.041
what this means.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.959
( sirens wailing )

15:29.125 --> 15:31.417
( growling )

15:31.458 --> 15:33.041

( crowd screaming )

16:20.375 --> 16:22.250
( sirens wail )

16:22.875 --> 16:25.208
Okay, that can't be good.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.667
( roars )

16:32.291 --> 16:34.333
( roars )

16:34.375 --> 16:36.709
( yelps )

16:36.750 --> 16:40.375
Ha-ha.

16:36.750 --> 16:40.375
Watch and learn, partner.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.583
( roars )

16:46.542 --> 16:49.291
( whimpers )

16:50.208 --> 16:52.417
Case and cage closed.

16:52.458 --> 16:53.500
Not quite.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.542
We still need

16:53.542 --> 16:55.542
to round up Servo.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.417
Uh, Dad?

16:55.583 --> 16:58.417
Mayor's on the phone.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.500
Ah, patch him through.

17:00.542 --> 17:05.083
MAYOR:

17:00.542 --> 17:05.083
M-My dinosaur display.

17:00.542 --> 17:05.083
Mayhem downtown.

17:05.125 --> 17:09.417
I want that robo-mutt

17:05.125 --> 17:09.417
off my island by morning!

17:13.417 --> 17:14.667
( beeps )

17:14.709 --> 17:16.417
( yaps )

17:17.125 --> 17:20.375
Where have you been hiding,

17:17.125 --> 17:20.375
you little rascal?

17:20.417 --> 17:22.417
I thought

17:20.417 --> 17:22.417
you'd run off again.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.750
Come to Mama.

17:26.542 --> 17:30.542
Ew, I don't even want

17:26.542 --> 17:30.542
to touch this filthy old thing.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.542
( growls )

17:43.583 --> 17:45.875
H.B., take this out

17:43.583 --> 17:45.875
to the trash, please.

17:45.917 --> 17:47.583
Ah, always with the...

17:47.625 --> 17:49.417
( grumbles )

17:49.458 --> 17:51.750
Oh, don't you look precious.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.875
Stay here.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.875
Mama's getting her camera!

17:59.250 --> 18:01.250
( yaps )

18:01.792 --> 18:05.417
Wha--? What's gotten

18:01.792 --> 18:05.417
into that dog?

18:07.583 --> 18:08.417
( mayor stammers )

18:08.458 --> 18:10.417
Poopsie! No, wait!

18:10.458 --> 18:12.291
It's-- Oh! Ow!

18:19.750 --> 18:21.291
Found you.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.417
Gotcha, Servo!

18:24.458 --> 18:26.333
Your reign of terror's over.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.375
CHIEF:

18:28.208 --> 18:30.375
How's the clean-up going, son?

18:30.417 --> 18:32.500
So far we have

18:30.417 --> 18:32.500
a destroyed fruit stand,

18:32.542 --> 18:34.625
broken plate glass,

18:32.542 --> 18:34.625
a ruined wedding cake,

18:34.667 --> 18:37.417
and a very upset carpenter.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.875
Copy that. Cody's been looking

18:37.458 --> 18:39.875
through video.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.375
Maybe he's spotted

18:39.917 --> 18:42.375
some damage we missed.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.458
No. Something more important.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.458
Dad, look.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.166
All the damage was

18:45.500 --> 18:48.166
because of Mrs. Luskey's dog.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.625
Servo was trying

18:48.208 --> 18:50.625
to protect her all along

18:50.667 --> 18:52.792
and rescuing people

18:50.667 --> 18:52.792
at the same time!

18:52.834 --> 18:54.333
Well, what do you know.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.500
His motives

18:54.375 --> 18:56.500
were clearly good, son,

18:56.542 --> 18:59.375
but he was still acting

18:56.542 --> 18:59.375
on his own,

18:59.417 --> 19:00.875
and we can't have that.

19:00.917 --> 19:04.417
But, Dad, you said yourself,

19:00.917 --> 19:04.417
unless it's an emergency.

19:04.458 --> 19:08.750
And these were all emergencies.

19:04.458 --> 19:08.750
He was just doing his job.

19:08.792 --> 19:10.375
You're right.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.333
I gave you those orders myself,

19:10.417 --> 19:13.333
didn't I, boy?

19:13.375 --> 19:14.333
( beeps )

19:14.375 --> 19:15.750
( phone rings )

19:15.792 --> 19:17.542
Emergency Dispatch.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.375
Yes, Mrs. Luskey.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.375
Oh, I'm glad you called.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.625
It seems that your dog--

19:22.667 --> 19:25.500
Oh, is that so?

19:25.542 --> 19:27.000
All right, well,

19:25.542 --> 19:27.000
we'll look into it.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.875
Poopsie's missing again.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.834
And the mayor too, but somehow

19:28.917 --> 19:32.834
that didn't seem as urgent.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.542
She says he went

19:32.875 --> 19:34.542
to take some trash out

19:34.583 --> 19:35.917
and never came back.

19:35.959 --> 19:38.875
All the automated garbage trucks

19:35.959 --> 19:38.875
have a video feed.

19:38.917 --> 19:42.208
I can tap in and see

19:38.917 --> 19:42.208
if it picked up anything.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.208
Aah!

19:43.250 --> 19:44.500
It picked up something,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.500
all right.

19:44.542 --> 19:45.875
The mayor and Poopsie!

19:45.917 --> 19:48.375
Rescue Team, city dump.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.375
Code red!

19:58.417 --> 20:01.500
Fan out, team.

20:01.542 --> 20:02.917
The Scrapmaster!

20:06.875 --> 20:08.750
[GRUNTING]

20:20.542 --> 20:21.834
My toupee!

20:21.875 --> 20:25.375
Oh, thank goodness

20:21.875 --> 20:25.375
I found it.

20:25.417 --> 20:29.250
( Poopsie yapping )

20:36.125 --> 20:37.458
( laughs )

20:37.500 --> 20:41.375
Thanks to the Burns family,

20:37.500 --> 20:41.375
we're safe and sound.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.041
Thanks to Servo.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.500
He's been keeping a good eye

20:43.083 --> 20:45.500
on your dog.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.500
( beeps )

20:46.542 --> 20:48.917
We, uh, programmed him

20:46.542 --> 20:48.917
that way.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.792
Any chance

20:48.959 --> 20:50.792
you might change your mind

20:50.834 --> 20:53.834
about getting rid of him?

20:50.834 --> 20:53.834
Um, uh, it, Mr. Mayor?

20:53.875 --> 20:55.750
Get rid of it?

20:55.792 --> 20:58.917
I-I can't believe

20:55.792 --> 20:58.917
you'd even consider it!

20:58.959 --> 21:00.583
Ahem. Let's face it.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.792
This is the dog

21:00.625 --> 21:03.792
that's out of control.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.000
Did ya hear that, Cody?

21:05.041 --> 21:07.041
Sure did. Noble!

21:07.458 --> 21:10.375
Aw, Poopsie!

21:12.375 --> 21:13.333
( yaps )

21:13.375 --> 21:15.667
Hey, come back here! Stop!

21:15.709 --> 21:17.333
You so missed

21:15.709 --> 21:17.333
your chance, Dad.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.333
Should have asked him

21:17.375 --> 21:19.333
for a raise.

21:19.375 --> 21:22.792
So the mayor's on board.

21:19.375 --> 21:22.792
What do you think, Heatwave?

21:22.834 --> 21:26.625
I say we return Servo

21:22.834 --> 21:26.625
to where he belongs.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.500
The firehouse.

21:28.542 --> 21:30.667
( beeps excitedly )

21:31.917 --> 21:34.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )
