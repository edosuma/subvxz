03:50.350 --> 03:55.020
TRAITOR. YOU MAY HAVE MY

ULTIMATELY BE YOUR UNDOING.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.560
ACCEPT YOUR FATE.

ROBO-STUFFINS.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.580

07:14.250 --> 07:16.950
IT'S NUMBER 3.

07:19.190 --> 07:21.060
OR IS IT NUMBER 1?

07:24.990 --> 07:29.000
OOH,
THIS IS IT, SIR DUCK--

07:29.030 --> 07:30.770
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.740
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

07:33.770 --> 07:36.240
SO WHERE'S THE DOORBELL?

07:36.270 --> 07:40.140
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT WHICH WEVER TO PULL.

07:40.180 --> 07:44.580

08:26.320 --> 08:29.030
HEY,

I KNEW THIS WOULD BE THE ONE
PWACE WHERE THE BAD, BAD MEN

09:32.790 --> 09:37.390
WOULD NEVER FIND ME OR
THE ROYAL SCEPTER.

09:37.430 --> 09:41.730
IN THE WRONG HANDS, THE
ROYAL SCEPTER CAN BE VERY,

09:41.770 --> 09:44.000
VERY DANGEROUS.

09:44.030 --> 09:49.170
THE SCEPTER IS THE KEY
TO WORMHOLE CENTRAL.

09:49.210 --> 09:54.680
LOONATICS. THANKS
FOR LEADING THE WAY.

09:54.710 --> 09:58.080
TOO BAD YOU WON'T BE STAYING.

09:58.110 --> 10:01.280

10:09.190 --> 10:11.730

10:58.880 --> 11:02.480
LOOKS LIKE THIS PARTY IS
GETTING A LITTLE LOPSIDED.

11:02.510 --> 11:06.420
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD,
IT'S SHOWTIME.

11:06.450 --> 11:09.950
TECHNO-SOLDIERS,
OBLITERATE THEM!

11:30.910 --> 11:33.140
AAH!

11:33.180 --> 11:36.880

12:14.250 --> 12:18.890
BUT I'VE GOT THE BIRD.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.160
TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
AND MUSTARD BEAK GETS IT.

12:23.190 --> 12:27.560
YOU ARE A VERY,
VERY BAD MAN.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.870
HAND OVER THE ROYAL SCEPTER.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.540
NO. DON'T DO IT.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.540
I'M WAITING FOR AN ANSWER.

12:36.570 --> 12:40.880
HEY,
DEUCE, PLEASE DON'T HURT

12:40.910 --> 12:42.550
MUSTARD BEAK.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.890
ACE!

13:05.300 --> 13:07.940
HEY,
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

13:07.970 --> 13:11.340
CALL IT AN INSURANCE POLICY,
IN CASE YOUR FRIENDS GET

13:11.370 --> 13:13.910
ANY IDEAS.

13:13.940 --> 13:20.150
I SHALL HAVE ONE OF
DEUCE'S ROBOTS LOOK AFTER YOU.

13:20.180 --> 13:24.250
HURRY. WE MUST GET TO
WORMHOLE CENTRAL AT ONCE.

13:24.290 --> 13:31.130
BURY THEM.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.530
AAH!

13:41.400 --> 13:43.110
SLAM, ARE YOU OKAY?

13:43.140 --> 13:45.210
MAYBE I CAN BLAST US OUT.

13:56.350 --> 13:58.620
BETTER HOLD FOR
THE BRAIN-BLAST, LEX.

13:58.650 --> 14:03.160
THIS PLACE COULD COME
DOWN AT ANY TIME.

14:03.190 --> 14:08.560
SOON THE UNIVERSE WILL BE
UNDER MY CONTROL, WITH YOU AS

14:08.600 --> 14:11.570
MY TOP GENERAL.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.240
UM,
ACTUALLY, OPTI BOY, I WAS

14:14.270 --> 14:17.510
THINKING OF A SLIGHTLY
HIGHER RANK.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.180
TAKE HIM!

14:19.210 --> 14:24.450
WHAT? YOU'RE
DOUBLE!

14:24.480 --> 14:28.520
WOW. I DID NOT SEE
THAT ONE COMING. DID YOU?

14:28.550 --> 14:30.390
SILENCE.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.160
I SERVE NO MASTER.

14:33.190 --> 14:36.990
WITH THE SCEPTER, I'LL PLUNGE
THE UNIVERSE INTO A WAR

14:37.030 --> 14:40.330
THAT'LL LAST FOR ALL ETERNITY.

14:40.360 --> 14:44.100
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A
TRAITOR, AND FOR THAT,

14:44.130 --> 14:45.600
YOU WILL PAY.

14:45.630 --> 14:47.970
AAH!

14:48.000 --> 14:51.940
THIS FERMION PHOTON CAGE
SHOULD KEEP YOU AND YOUR LIGHT

14:51.980 --> 14:54.410
POWERS IN CHECK.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.280
AAH!

14:58.310 --> 15:03.050
LATER YOU'LL BE JOINING
YOUR BELOVED SISTER.

15:03.090 --> 15:04.520
MY SISTER?

15:04.550 --> 15:06.590
HA HA HA!

15:06.620 --> 15:08.620
YEAH.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.690
WHERE IS ZODAVIA?

15:10.730 --> 15:15.500
EXACTLY WHERE I
SENT HER--TO HER DOOM.

15:19.070 --> 15:20.270
HUH?

15:20.300 --> 15:23.070
HUH?

15:23.110 --> 15:26.510
UH.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.060
HEY!

15:40.090 --> 15:41.990
REV.

15:42.030 --> 15:44.030
YOU GUYS ARE A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.630
WE LOCKED ON TO YOUR
TRACKING SIGNAL AND GOT HERE

15:45.660 --> 15:47.660
AS SOON AS WE COULD.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.500
IF IT WEREN'T FOR A LAW
OF PHYSICS THAT SAYS NOTHING

15:49.530 --> 15:51.230
CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN
THE SPEED OF LIGHT,

15:51.270 --> 15:53.140
WE'D HAVE GOTTEN HERE
EVEN SOONER.

15:53.170 --> 15:56.370
YOU MUST STOP THE BAD,
BAD MEN, ACE, AND SAVE MY

15:56.410 --> 15:58.140
FRIEND SIR DUCK.

15:58.170 --> 16:02.550
HEY,
CHICKEN FRICASSEE, IT'S OVER.

16:02.580 --> 16:06.250
THEY GOT THE ROYAL SCEPTER.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.320
TWUE,
BUT THE ROYAL SCEPTER DON'T

16:09.350 --> 16:14.290
WORK WITHOUT THE ROYAL JEWEL.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.060
I GAVE IT TO SIR DUCK
WHEN I KNIGHTED HIM.

16:18.090 --> 16:22.530
I COULDN'T CHANCE IT
FALLING INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.770
AND WHERE IS
THE MISSING GEM?

16:24.800 --> 16:28.100
SAFELY AROUND
SIR DUCK'S NECK.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.340
BUT DUCK IS IN
THE WRONG HANDS.

16:30.370 --> 16:33.340
THAT'S WHY YOU MUST STOP
THEM FROM WEACHING WORMHOLE

16:33.380 --> 16:36.610
CENTRAL BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

16:36.650 --> 16:40.320
LEX, SLAM, SYLTH,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

16:40.350 --> 16:43.790
TECH, REV, KEEP AN EYE
ON OUR ROYAL MAJESTY.

16:47.820 --> 16:52.260
UH. ZODAVIA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.700
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE,
BIG BROTHER?

16:57.730 --> 17:02.570
SAVING THE UNIVERSE.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.610
ZODAVIA, DROP!

17:07.640 --> 17:09.380
INTRUDER.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.750
NICE SHOOTING.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.650
DEUCE BETRAYED ME.

17:16.690 --> 17:20.190
HE PLANS TO PLUNGE THE
UNIVERSE INTO CHAOS.

17:20.220 --> 17:22.130
WELL,
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.460
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT DEUCE HERE.

17:24.490 --> 17:28.130
THE WAY HE SPOKE,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

17:28.160 --> 17:33.300
SO DID HE WHEN HE BLASTED
ME INTO SPACE, BUT I STILL HAD

17:33.340 --> 17:39.880
THE COSMIC GUITAR AND WAS
ABLE TO RESTORE MY POWERS.

17:39.910 --> 17:44.180
WITH DEUCE THINKING WE'RE BOTH
OUT OF THE WAY, WE CAN CATCH

17:44.210 --> 17:46.650
HIM OFF GUARD AND STOP HIM.

17:46.680 --> 17:52.620
THIS SEEMS MOST
UNUSUAL--US FIGHTING TOGETHER.

17:52.660 --> 17:57.630
NO,
US FIGHTING ON THE SAME SIDE.

17:57.660 --> 18:02.130
AH. I LIKE THAT.

18:02.170 --> 18:07.400
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP MY FWIENDS.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.440
HMM. MAYBE THERE IS.

18:19.350 --> 18:21.820
SO THIS IS GRAND
CENTRAL WORMHOLE.

18:26.490 --> 18:29.190
GANG, BETTER KEEP
YOUR EYES PEELED.

18:29.230 --> 18:32.400
THEY SEEM TO BE ONE
NUT JOB SHORT.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.760
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
HERE JUST IN TIME.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.470
I'M AFRAID TIME IS
SOMETHING YOU'VE RUN OUT OF.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.870
NOW STEP ASIDE.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.510
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T DO THAT.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.840
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD, ATTACK!

18:47.880 --> 18:51.750
TECHNO-SOLDIERS, DESTROY
THESE PESTS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.720
AAH!

19:25.310 --> 19:30.420
OBLITERATE THEM!

19:30.450 --> 19:32.560
LEX!

19:32.590 --> 19:33.890
WHOA!

19:33.920 --> 19:35.460
HEY, GUYS.
A LITTLE HELP HERE.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.800
UH-OH.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.360
THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.430
WE'VE BEEN IN TIGHT
SITUATIONS BEFORE, LEXI.

20:16.470 --> 20:17.700
COME ON!

20:23.070 --> 20:25.970
AAH!

20:49.530 --> 20:53.670
ZODAVIA, GLAD YOU COULD MAKE
IT, BUT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

20:53.700 --> 20:56.410
ABOUT THE COMPANY YOU KEEP.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.070
ZODAVIA.

20:58.110 --> 21:03.650
I TOLD YOU YOUR DISLOYALTY
WOULD BE YOUR UNDOING.

21:03.680 --> 21:09.080
HOW SWEET--SIBLINGS
FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.750
TECHNO-SOLDIERS, DESTROY THEM!

21:23.900 --> 21:25.670
AAH!

21:25.700 --> 21:28.570
COME ON, COME ON. I'LL
PULVERIZE YOU. I'LL--

21:36.040 --> 21:38.680
ANY LAST WORDS?

21:38.710 --> 21:42.450
I GOT A FEW, ONLY I'D HAVE
TO WASH MY MOUTH OUT

21:42.490 --> 21:45.120
WITH SOAP AFTERWARDS.

21:45.150 --> 21:50.660
MR. GENERAL, SIR, DO YOU
THINK YOU CAN LET ME GO?

21:50.690 --> 21:54.560
I'M NOT REALLY WITH
THESE DO-GOODERS.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.870
AND WHAT DO YOU OFFER
ME IN EXCHANGE?

21:57.900 --> 22:02.470
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE
THEPTER WON'T WORK WITHOUT

22:02.510 --> 22:10.510
THE ROYAL JEWEL, AND DUCK'S
WEARING IT AROUND HIS NECK.

22:10.550 --> 22:20.590
SO MY NECK WAS REALLY ON THE
LINE WHEN IT WAS ON THE LINE.

22:20.620 --> 22:21.920
BLABBERMOUTH.

22:28.460 --> 22:32.440
WELL, LOOK WHO'S
HERE--HIS ROYAL MAJESTY.

22:36.710 --> 22:41.780
I ORDER YOU TO DWOP YOUR
WEAPONS AND SUWWENDER AT ONCE.

22:41.810 --> 22:45.480
AND WHO'S GOING TO MAKE ME?

22:45.510 --> 22:50.850
JUST WITTLE OLD ME AND
MY ARMY OF EGGBOTS.

22:50.890 --> 22:54.660
MY GOOD FWIENDS HAVE
RETROFIT MY SERVANT BOTS

22:54.690 --> 22:56.990
WITH SPECIAL ARMOR.

22:57.030 --> 23:01.460
MADE OF THE STRONGEST ALLOY
FOUND THIS SIDE OF ANDROMEDA.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.930
OR THE OTHER SIDE OF
ANDROMEDA, FOR THAT MATTER,

23:02.970 --> 23:04.530
IF ANDROMEDA HAD SIDES,
WHICH IT DOESN'T

23:04.570 --> 23:06.700
BECAUSE IT'S
A SPIRAL-SHAPED GALAXY

23:06.740 --> 23:09.670
MANY LIGHT-YEARS WIDE,
ALSO KNOWN AS M31 AND NGC 224.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.920
COVER ME, LEX.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.560
LOOKS LIKE THE MAN OF THE HOUR
IS TRYING TO DUCK OUT OF HIS

23:27.590 --> 23:28.590
OWN PARTY.

23:40.770 --> 23:47.010
UNIVERSAL PORTAL,
I COMMAND YOU TO OPEN.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.950
NOW!

24:10.200 --> 24:12.600
GUARDIAN STRIKE
SWORD, ATTACK!

24:19.140 --> 24:21.540
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO

24:21.580 --> 24:24.180
SAY GOOD-BYE.

24:24.210 --> 24:28.980
NO. IT'S I WHO WILL BE
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU,

24:29.020 --> 24:32.720
RABBIT--PERMANENTLY.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.620
AH!

24:59.280 --> 25:02.550
I SEE YOU STILL HAVE THE
OLD MOVES WORKING FOR YOU.

25:05.790 --> 25:08.060
AND A FEW NEW ONES
THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.

25:16.360 --> 25:21.700
ONCE I ASSEMBLE A NEW
ARMY, I'LL BE BACK.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.870
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:23.910 --> 25:27.740
LOOKS LIKE YOU BOUGHT
YOURSELF A ONE-WAY TICKET.

25:27.780 --> 25:30.050
OH!

25:30.080 --> 25:30.750
OH!

25:46.160 --> 25:48.860
NOT BAD FOR A DAY'S WORK.

25:48.900 --> 25:53.000
TAKING OUT THE TRASH
IS MY FAVORITE CHORE.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.940
OH. IT LOOKS LIKE I MISSED
ONE BAG OF CRUD.

25:56.970 --> 26:00.710
NO, DUCK.
OPTIMATUS HAS CHANGED.

26:00.740 --> 26:05.080
IT WAS THE THIRST FOR UNLIMITED
POWER THAT CORRUPTED HIM.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.720
NOW HE MUST LEARN
TO USE HIS POWERS

26:07.750 --> 26:08.650
TO BE A BETTER LEADER.
