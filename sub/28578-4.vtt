WEBVTT

00:10.004 --> 00:12.457
In a few moments, Special
Counsel Robert Mueller

00:12.482 --> 00:15.551
will deliver his first public
remarks on his investigation.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.708
It's happening! There
he is! It's happening!

00:18.733 --> 00:22.003
Hooray! He's gonna make
the case for impeachment

00:22.028 --> 00:23.921
so we don't have to!

00:23.923 --> 00:27.609
Oh, no! If Mueller read the
Mueller Report, I'm screwed!

00:27.634 --> 00:29.349
At long last, here is Mr. Mueller.

00:29.373 --> 00:30.671
Mueller! Mueller!

00:30.695 --> 00:33.297
I am speaking today to announce

00:33.299 --> 00:36.100
that our investigation is complete

00:36.102 --> 00:38.802
and to reveal to the American people

00:38.804 --> 00:40.471
that I am really hurt

00:40.473 --> 00:43.307
that only a few of
you read my big report.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.175
I worked super hard on it.

00:45.177 --> 00:48.185
My wife said it was the
best thing she ever read.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.279
Uh-oh.

00:49.304 --> 00:52.193
Now let's get back to
this historic crisis,

00:52.218 --> 00:56.587
which I've decided to punt to
our broken, shithead Congress.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.356
The ball is now in
your turd-strewn court.

00:59.358 --> 01:01.791
Thanks for the homework, asshole.

01:01.793 --> 01:05.895
I trust a room of 500
backstabbing trash bags

01:05.897 --> 01:09.499
of human sludge will
come to a swift consensus.

01:09.501 --> 01:13.069
My god, Chuck. Will this
affect the infrastructure bill?!

01:13.071 --> 01:14.704
Not if there's a God.

01:14.706 --> 01:16.597
Now, I'm sure you expected

01:16.622 --> 01:19.175
that with the eyes
of the nation upon me,

01:19.177 --> 01:21.745
I would at the very least summarize

01:21.747 --> 01:23.713
the President's wrongdoings.

01:23.715 --> 01:25.548
Too bad. I'm a coward.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.017
Anyway, I quit.

01:27.019 --> 01:29.218
Good luck with the whole
saving America thing.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.319
Boooo!

01:30.321 --> 01:33.623
Wait. So it's all on Pelosi? Boo!

01:33.625 --> 01:37.393
It's all on me?! Booooo!

01:37.395 --> 01:38.828
I'm invincible!

01:38.830 --> 01:40.396
And more breaking news.

01:40.398 --> 01:44.433
A new Fox News poll has Trump
trailing Biden by 11 points.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.526
Damn it!

01:45.551 --> 01:47.936
Look at me, Beto!

01:47.938 --> 01:50.540
I can stand on stuff, too! Unh!

01:56.514 --> 01:59.782
I'm Jake Tapper, and
I'll smile when I'm dead.

01:59.807 --> 02:01.832
We're going live now to President Trump

02:01.857 --> 02:03.286
who's sitting down with his cabinet

02:03.288 --> 02:05.254
for a foreign-policy discussion,

02:05.256 --> 02:08.122
and there appears to be
a small but growing fire.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.392
Let's tune in...

02:09.394 --> 02:11.516
Today, we're discussing
my latest proposal

02:11.541 --> 02:12.895
for Middle East peace...
which I whipped up

02:12.897 --> 02:14.430
while on the Pelaton this morning...

02:14.432 --> 02:16.365
So let's stay focused
on the task at hand...

02:16.367 --> 02:17.833
Shut up! Alright. This
is what we're gonna do.

02:17.835 --> 02:20.636
Tomorrow we're launching
drone strikes on every country

02:20.638 --> 02:23.272
that was mean to me in this
dream I had last night...

02:23.274 --> 02:25.474
Iraq, Belgium, and Birdville.

02:25.476 --> 02:28.077
My office has a big list
of all the countries,

02:28.079 --> 02:30.044
and I don't think
Birdville is on the list.

02:30.046 --> 02:32.681
Also the fire has spread
to the hem of my pants.

02:32.683 --> 02:36.818
I'm with Pompeo on this one.
I also appear to be on fire.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.420
Hey! Focus!

02:38.422 --> 02:40.689
Sprinklers!

02:40.691 --> 02:42.924
DeVos, get out the Slip 'N Slide!

02:42.926 --> 02:45.865
Bolton, you son of a bitch,
we need music!

02:45.890 --> 02:47.161
Yay! Yay! Yay!

02:49.666 --> 02:51.533
That cabinet meeting
was more embarrassing

02:51.535 --> 02:53.268
than my dad describing the type of porn

02:53.270 --> 02:54.736
he wanted me to sneak into his prison.

02:54.738 --> 02:56.471
An unnamed source who
definitely isn't me

02:56.473 --> 02:58.506
is leaking that the cabinet is in chaos.

02:58.508 --> 02:59.907
Which is the kind of issue

02:59.909 --> 03:02.477
Democrats would love to
bury you with in 2020.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.412
Just let me get some
competent people in here.

03:04.414 --> 03:06.248
I know how to hire people, Jared.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.382
I learned it from the Dalai Lama himself

03:08.384 --> 03:10.684
at Trump Plaza in 1984.

03:10.686 --> 03:13.554
He taught me how to
see into a person's soul

03:13.556 --> 03:15.857
to determine their true excellence.

03:15.859 --> 03:18.092
To know the best when I see it.

03:18.094 --> 03:20.762
And when I can't see it, I can smell it.

03:20.764 --> 03:23.297
And if it's smelly enough
and the windows are closed,

03:23.299 --> 03:25.199
I can kind of taste it, too.

03:25.201 --> 03:28.236
Of course. The best is
whatever you say is the best.

03:28.238 --> 03:30.071
Don't you tell me what the best is.

03:30.073 --> 03:32.273
The best is whatever I say is the best!

03:33.442 --> 03:35.409
Aha, Chuck Todd!

03:35.411 --> 03:37.078
Now that I've destroyed your argument

03:37.080 --> 03:39.546
against undocumented
children being housed

03:39.548 --> 03:42.349
three to a port-o-potty,
you must do penance

03:42.351 --> 03:44.986
by flogging yourself with
this cat o' nine tails!

03:44.988 --> 03:48.055
Ugh. I always regret not knocking first.

03:48.057 --> 03:49.790
Stevie, I'm afraid your appearance

03:49.792 --> 03:51.324
on Meet The Press is canceled.

03:51.326 --> 03:54.027
But, sir, I've been going on
as many Tinder dates as I can

03:54.029 --> 03:55.929
just to practice talking over people.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.998
The media's coming after my cabinet.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.933
I need someone with sophistication.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.213
Not someone who time
travelers kept trying to kill

04:02.238 --> 04:03.304
when they were a baby.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.508
You're not going to
replace your cabinet again,

04:06.532 --> 04:08.909
are you, Dad? Some of them are so new,

04:08.911 --> 04:11.878
I can't talk to them because
of the Stranger Danger rule.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.313
They're not going anywhere,

04:13.315 --> 04:15.015
unless Herman Cain shows interest,

04:15.017 --> 04:18.084
and I need to trade the whole
team to land that all-star.

04:18.086 --> 04:20.687
Did you see what your
genius cabinet has done?

04:20.689 --> 04:21.754
Cured cancer?

04:21.755 --> 04:23.790
Trump's cabinet is cancer.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.525
Heh. Talk about an air ball.

04:25.527 --> 04:28.161
Here are screw-ups from
the past seven days.

04:28.163 --> 04:30.429
John Bolton locked himself
in the trunk of his own car.

04:30.431 --> 04:32.096
Mike Pompeo wore traditional silk

04:32.121 --> 04:33.199
to meet the Thai delegation

04:33.201 --> 04:34.700
and kept sliding off all the furniture.

04:34.702 --> 04:36.435
Ben Carson fell down the same well

04:36.437 --> 04:38.103
he's fallen down six times.

04:38.105 --> 04:40.840
Anyone looks bad when you
focus on what they did.

04:40.842 --> 04:44.210
I am only in the same house
as you a few days a year.

04:44.212 --> 04:47.446
Hire someone to control these
idiots so I can feel safe.

04:47.448 --> 04:50.115
I suppose it couldn't hurt to
interview a candidate or two.

04:50.117 --> 04:52.351
You know, just in case
any staff get caught

04:52.353 --> 04:55.454
joining the mile-high
club on a log flume!

04:55.456 --> 04:57.622
If you don't get caught,
you're not doing it right!

04:58.960 --> 05:02.494
Say hello to your next
Chief of Staff, Tim Pawlenty.

05:02.496 --> 05:04.463
Former State Rep, Governor of Minnesota,

05:04.465 --> 05:06.832
and chair of several
presidential campaigns.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.300
Our schedule is pretty grueling.

05:08.302 --> 05:10.001
We demand a three-week commitment,

05:10.003 --> 05:13.372
followed by two weeks of being
maligned by me on social media.

05:13.374 --> 05:16.508
Those you can work from home.
Now let's see what you can do.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.378
I am here to put this house in order.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.848
First, everyone must
attend all meetings.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.283
No more dressing your
housekeeper up in your clothes

05:25.285 --> 05:26.852
and sending her in your place.

05:26.854 --> 05:28.653
Uh-uh-uh.

05:28.655 --> 05:31.122
And for the sake of time-management,

05:31.124 --> 05:34.025
no wasting ten minutes
complimenting the President,

05:34.027 --> 05:38.329
and we all read your
briefings together, word by...

05:38.331 --> 05:40.098
Tim Pawlenty is so fired!

05:40.100 --> 05:42.634
I'd like to thank Tim for
his eight minutes of service,

05:42.636 --> 05:44.936
but I can't because he was terrible!

05:44.938 --> 05:47.138
It's been an honor to
serve you, Mr. President.

05:47.140 --> 05:50.340
Ugh! Go back to
Minnesota and milk a lake!

05:50.342 --> 05:51.942
Go on, get!

05:51.944 --> 05:53.511
So things get a little bumpy

05:53.513 --> 05:56.614
and you go running into
the boring arms of Pawlenty?

05:56.616 --> 05:59.483
Relax. Jared says he has
other great candidates.

05:59.485 --> 06:00.818
Ever heard of Newt Gingrich?

06:00.820 --> 06:03.320
Jared knows this guy who
looks exactly like him.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.256
But only you know who
the best people are.

06:06.258 --> 06:07.591
What's your gut tell you?

06:07.593 --> 06:09.627
- Bigfoot is real.
- What else?

06:09.629 --> 06:11.796
It's telling me that maybe
we shouldn't hire someone

06:11.798 --> 06:13.564
just because he's got a good résumé

06:13.566 --> 06:15.966
and never ran a
glass-bottom boat ashore.

06:15.968 --> 06:18.636
I just feel like I'm in a rut.

06:18.638 --> 06:21.204
The President won't give
me a high-profile role

06:21.206 --> 06:24.207
that allows me to really spread my ooze.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.477
Not everyone has the charismatic

06:26.479 --> 06:30.212
megawatt "it" factor
that makes me a star.

06:30.214 --> 06:32.315
- You're trash!
- Rot in hell! Shame

06:32.317 --> 06:33.650
- Shame! Shame!
- Shame! Shame!

06:33.652 --> 06:35.017
For the sake of other diners,

06:35.019 --> 06:37.754
and so I can look my future
grandchildren in the eye,

06:37.756 --> 06:39.155
I must ask you to leave.

06:39.157 --> 06:42.158
I'll take this to go. If
the chef spits in it again,

06:42.160 --> 06:44.126
tell him to gargle some Cholula first.

06:44.128 --> 06:45.595
It could use a kick.

06:45.597 --> 06:47.229
Well! Well, well, well!

06:47.231 --> 06:49.599
If it isn't Trump's human shield.

06:49.601 --> 06:51.501
Can't go out in public without somebody

06:51.503 --> 06:53.970
taking a long hot wizz on their shoes.

06:53.972 --> 06:55.572
I remember those days.

06:55.574 --> 06:58.608
That was before I grew the
beard and everything changed.

06:58.610 --> 07:01.544
Growing facial hair made
people like Ted Cruz?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.346
Senator Cruz, right this way.

07:03.348 --> 07:05.715
The other diners can't
wait to regard the majesty

07:05.717 --> 07:07.183
of your plentiful whiskers.

07:07.185 --> 07:10.286
Ah-ha-ha! I'd tell 'em to take
a picture, it'll last longer,

07:10.288 --> 07:12.654
but I don't show up in photographs!

07:15.726 --> 07:17.693
I don't want new people, Jared.

07:17.695 --> 07:20.128
But Americans no longer
trust your cabinet.

07:20.130 --> 07:21.830
This is the first time
since the founding

07:21.832 --> 07:24.633
that the White House has been
denied homeowners insurance.

07:24.635 --> 07:26.468
How can you know that
these people are the best?

07:26.470 --> 07:29.270
Jared, when your dad
picked out which prostitute

07:29.272 --> 07:31.373
to film your uncle having sex with,

07:31.375 --> 07:33.441
he didn't hold a casting call.

07:33.443 --> 07:34.877
He just knew.

07:34.879 --> 07:37.913
Just like I can't know someone's
the best by his résumé.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.148
I know it by the joke
he writes on the check

07:40.150 --> 07:41.984
where he's supposed to leave a tip.

07:41.986 --> 07:44.085
My cabinet is already the best.

07:44.087 --> 07:45.754
And I'm going to teach them

07:45.756 --> 07:48.524
to unlock that bestness
within themselves.

07:48.526 --> 07:49.958
You know what? Let's... Let's do it.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.829
Let's make your team so competent

07:51.854 --> 07:53.550
that they'll stop showing
up late because they went

07:53.574 --> 07:54.595
to the wrong White House.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.631
Help! Help!

07:56.633 --> 07:58.699
Ben Carson fell down
the well again, sir.

07:58.701 --> 08:01.301
Lower a bucket of
saltines to him, Kellyanne!

08:01.303 --> 08:05.339
A lot of saltines! He's
got a big day tomorrow!

08:08.578 --> 08:10.811
Today's gonna be a little different.

08:10.813 --> 08:12.212
Follow the President's lead,

08:12.214 --> 08:15.416
or you'll be just another
loser on the unemployment line

08:15.418 --> 08:17.418
with a million-dollar book deal.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.921
Did someone say "loser"?

08:21.090 --> 08:22.757
How'd you sneak in here?!

08:22.759 --> 08:24.059
Am I here?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.799
- Or am I here?
- Ooh!

08:33.802 --> 08:37.371
They say you're losers, the
worst cabinet in history.

08:37.373 --> 08:41.006
With my teaching, you'll be able
to look them in the eye and say,

08:41.009 --> 08:44.111
"No, you're the worst
cabinet in history!"

08:44.113 --> 08:46.046
Your journey begins now.

08:46.048 --> 08:49.466
Come with me if you want to live.

08:49.982 --> 08:52.519
Oh, God damn it. I don't wanna...

08:52.521 --> 08:54.754
Again? Oh, no. Come on.

08:54.756 --> 08:59.016
I don't wanna go anywhere.
Oh, why do we have to go...

08:59.041 --> 09:01.361
Ugh. Jesus Christ. No.

09:01.363 --> 09:03.863
This is the first time
I've had a visitor.

09:03.865 --> 09:05.499
Are you peckish? Can I offer you

09:05.501 --> 09:07.767
a cold battery from
my freezer to suck on?

09:07.769 --> 09:09.536
Say, what's that on your face?

09:09.538 --> 09:11.905
I want to become more likable
in the eyes of the President,

09:11.907 --> 09:14.641
so I grew a beard exactly like yours.

09:14.643 --> 09:15.775
Any notes?

09:15.777 --> 09:17.443
I'm afraid Donald Trump thinks a man

09:17.445 --> 09:20.580
should keep his face as smooth
as a 3-D printed assault rifle.

09:20.582 --> 09:23.516
He does like a nice
head of hair, though.

09:23.518 --> 09:25.952
You can make a wig out
of my beard shavings.

09:25.954 --> 09:27.921
I would donate it to
a cancer kids charity,

09:27.923 --> 09:29.889
but it causes a vitamin D deficiency

09:29.891 --> 09:32.892
as well as a massive spike
in every other vitamin.

09:32.894 --> 09:36.029
Now you just need a complete
personality transformation.

09:36.031 --> 09:39.398
But who will save America from
caravans of Guatemalan moms

09:39.400 --> 09:40.705
if not Stephen Miller?!

09:40.730 --> 09:43.631
Stephen Miller is
dead! Don't you get it?!

09:44.339 --> 09:46.640
Now let's go make some
hair-lovin' friends.

09:48.110 --> 09:52.178
To be the best, you must believe
you are the best at everything.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.514
I want each of you to walk a tightrope

09:54.516 --> 09:56.182
to the Washington Monument.

09:56.184 --> 09:59.552
The best do not
hesitate; they simply do.

09:59.554 --> 10:02.288
Use the force. There is no spoon.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.290
Time to make the donuts.

10:04.292 --> 10:05.625
- I believe in you.
- You got this!

10:05.627 --> 10:06.859
Watch out for airplanes.

10:06.861 --> 10:08.361
Now I believe in physics!

10:08.363 --> 10:10.029
- You're up, Bolton.
- You can do it, Bolton.

10:10.031 --> 10:11.830
Look at me! I'm a bomb!

10:11.832 --> 10:12.965
Kaboom!

10:12.967 --> 10:14.267
Yeah, I think I got this.

10:16.371 --> 10:18.371
This is terrible. What else is on?

10:18.373 --> 10:20.005
Sir, let me take a crack.

10:20.007 --> 10:21.807
If I can hold my nose and work for

10:21.809 --> 10:24.209
a casino bankrupting
failed steak salesmen...

10:24.211 --> 10:26.678
not you... I can turn this crew around.

10:29.283 --> 10:33.218
Mister Cruz, lovely to see
you and that coarse thicket.

10:33.220 --> 10:35.387
Who is your elegantly coiffed companion?

10:35.389 --> 10:37.689
This is my friend from politics.

10:37.691 --> 10:39.591
- His name is...
- Stefan!

10:39.593 --> 10:41.759
Je m'appelle Stefan Millar.

10:41.761 --> 10:44.896
I am Washington's newest cad about town.

10:44.898 --> 10:46.731
It's ya boy!

10:46.733 --> 10:49.734
Thank God you said Stefan
Millar and not Stephen Miller.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.837
He's as disgusting as the
things we do to his food.

10:52.839 --> 10:55.173
Sea bass marinated in
the liquid wrung from

10:55.175 --> 10:57.275
the bus boy's exercise undergarments.

10:57.277 --> 10:59.678
Table bread that's been
dipped in industrial cleaner

10:59.680 --> 11:00.978
and used to clean tables.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.714
That one actually tasted pretty good.

11:02.716 --> 11:05.783
I once straight up took
a dump on his kale caesar.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.251
Right this way, Mister Millar!

11:07.253 --> 11:08.386
Yes, sir!

11:10.245 --> 11:12.456
Before you sits a spirit potion

11:12.458 --> 11:15.626
composed of Diet Coke
concentrate and expired pills

11:15.628 --> 11:18.429
I swiped from the
President's nightstand.

11:18.431 --> 11:21.933
Drink deep, and you will
walk the path to bestness...

11:21.935 --> 11:23.567
or you'll die instantly.

11:23.569 --> 11:24.769
Win, win.

11:30.944 --> 11:32.210
We have the best people...

11:32.212 --> 11:34.411
The best people... The best people...

11:34.413 --> 11:35.980
The best people... The best people...

11:35.982 --> 11:38.014
Best people. We have the
best people in the world.

11:38.016 --> 11:39.549
The best people... Best people...

11:39.551 --> 11:41.084
Best people... best people...

11:41.086 --> 11:42.685
Best people... best people...

11:42.687 --> 11:45.188
Best people... best
people... best people...

11:48.861 --> 11:52.462
I'm finally dead. And
I still have my wallet!

11:52.464 --> 11:54.998
I knew I could take my money with me!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.834
No way would I be dead
and not burning in hell.

11:57.836 --> 12:00.103
Must be some lame spiritual plane

12:00.105 --> 12:02.172
where all truth is revealed.

12:05.778 --> 12:08.178
To walk the path to bestness,

12:08.180 --> 12:10.947
you must embrace these truths...

12:10.949 --> 12:13.549
If he says it, you agree.

12:13.551 --> 12:16.051
Do not do for yourself what you can scam

12:16.053 --> 12:19.054
a subcontractor into doing for you.

12:19.056 --> 12:22.324
And Graydon Carter should have
been fired from Vanity Fair

12:22.326 --> 12:24.059
a long time ago,

12:24.061 --> 12:27.696
that magazine has never
recovered, such a shame.

12:27.698 --> 12:31.200
I agree. Scam subcontractors.

12:31.202 --> 12:33.135
Graydon Carter sucks.

12:33.137 --> 12:36.272
I agree. Scam subcontractors.

12:36.274 --> 12:39.641
Graydon Carter sucks. I agree.

12:42.346 --> 12:45.392
How 'bout that economy?
Is it doing great or what?

12:46.478 --> 12:48.450
I... agree?

12:48.452 --> 12:50.751
Wow! Nothin' but net, Bolton.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.021
- Betsy. Schools?
- Very schools!

12:53.023 --> 12:54.055
Swish!

12:54.057 --> 12:55.690
Mike Pompeo, North Korea?

12:55.692 --> 12:57.625
Uh, gettin' Norther every day.

12:57.627 --> 12:59.093
Three points and the foul.

12:59.095 --> 13:00.795
- Mnuchin?
- We got money in the thing.

13:00.797 --> 13:03.298
Basketball went in
the basketball basket!

13:03.300 --> 13:05.099
Last but not least, Ben Carson.

13:05.101 --> 13:08.169
- Where are we on...
- Graydon Carter sucks?

13:08.171 --> 13:10.104
Ben with the buzzer beater!

13:10.106 --> 13:13.141
They gave that guy a magazine? Terrible.

13:13.143 --> 13:16.444
Everyone, you are truly the best.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.416
Last week, we said the President

13:22.418 --> 13:24.584
should have his entire cabinet executed

13:24.586 --> 13:26.553
and run the government by himself.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.155
But we're eatin' those words

13:28.157 --> 13:29.923
after yesterday's cabinet meeting

13:29.925 --> 13:32.893
went off without a single
gun fired into the ceilin'!

13:32.895 --> 13:34.261
I won them back!

13:34.263 --> 13:36.296
And they've questioned my every move

13:36.298 --> 13:38.198
since declaring me infallible.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.234
When we come back, the hot goss

13:40.236 --> 13:42.635
on the Beltway It Boy, Stefan Millar.

13:42.637 --> 13:44.771
Just last night he was
seen at a restaurant

13:44.773 --> 13:47.207
Gwyneth Paltrow might visit someday.

13:47.209 --> 13:48.976
Jared, get me Stefan Millar.

13:48.978 --> 13:52.212
He's got something special...
he was just on my TV.

13:52.214 --> 13:54.514
GQ loves you so much.

13:54.516 --> 13:56.850
Now break that news, baby.
I can take it.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.353
Stefan Millar is less a spokesperson

14:00.355 --> 14:02.188
and more a way of life.

14:02.190 --> 14:03.690
Stefan...

14:03.692 --> 14:06.393
A lot of people tell me I'm the
smartest guy they've ever met.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.461
And I'm like, "You need
to meet more people!"

14:08.463 --> 14:10.029
Meet more people...

14:10.031 --> 14:13.833
Confession! I've gone to
the grocery store in pajamas!

14:13.835 --> 14:15.268
Relatable...

14:15.270 --> 14:17.837
People ask me what I'm thinking
about during these things.

14:17.839 --> 14:20.774
To be honest... pizza and Netflix. Ha!

14:21.376 --> 14:23.476
Here's to being the best people,

14:23.478 --> 14:25.578
and all it took was drinking poison.

14:25.580 --> 14:26.913
Cheers!

14:26.915 --> 14:30.450
Oh, wow. A fan's sending
us a bottle of wine.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.287
- You still suck!
- We still hate you!

14:34.289 --> 14:36.956
Excuse me. Uh, since my name is already

14:36.958 --> 14:39.591
a nationwide trending topic
just for approaching your table,

14:39.593 --> 14:41.727
I must ask you to leave.

14:41.729 --> 14:44.140
Stefan Millar, I saw you

14:44.165 --> 14:46.265
on Fox & Friends, so you got the job.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.500
I'm thinking new press secretary/

14:48.502 --> 14:50.602
speechwriter/best friend.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.771
- I won't let you down, sir!
- Cool.

14:52.773 --> 14:55.774
Your first job is to fire
the guy you're replacing.

14:55.776 --> 14:57.343
Get Stephen Miller in here.

14:57.345 --> 15:00.012
Um, shouldn't I fill out my
on-boarding paperwork first?

15:00.014 --> 15:01.713
We don't do that kind of thing here.

15:01.715 --> 15:04.984
This is gonna be pathetic.
I can't watch.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.389
Um...

15:06.955 --> 15:08.520
This is Stephen Miller!

15:08.522 --> 15:10.856
Who are you, and why are you so cool?!

15:10.858 --> 15:12.390
I'm Stefan Millar,

15:12.392 --> 15:14.422
and you're fired, Stephen Miller.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.527
But Mr. President,

15:15.529 --> 15:16.895
I, Stephen Miller, can change!

15:16.897 --> 15:19.331
I can't hear you,
Stevie. My back is turned.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.934
I, Stephen Miller, won't
leave without a fight!

15:21.936 --> 15:25.403
I challenge you, Stefan
Millar, to a sword fight!

15:25.405 --> 15:26.939
Draw your sword, coward!

15:26.941 --> 15:28.239
Ting! Ting! Shing!

15:28.241 --> 15:30.275
Wow. I'd turn around and watch,

15:30.277 --> 15:33.579
but I don't want to move out
of this nice warm sunbeam.

15:33.581 --> 15:35.481
Hunh! Curses!

15:35.483 --> 15:37.983
I, Stephen Miller, am slain!

15:37.985 --> 15:39.250
Tell Rush Limbaugh...

15:39.252 --> 15:41.151
I'll be tuning in from on high.

15:41.153 --> 15:43.654
Arrrgh!

15:43.656 --> 15:44.856
Whew!

15:44.858 --> 15:46.891
Who are you five lovely maidens?

15:46.893 --> 15:49.026
We are Stephen Miller's girlfriends!

15:49.028 --> 15:53.364
Sandy, Mandy, Candy, Tandy, and Shandy!

15:53.366 --> 15:55.432
Who will give us the gift of child now?

15:55.434 --> 15:58.469
I, Stefan Millar, will
fertilize each of you

15:58.471 --> 16:00.037
with my oxygenized seed.

16:00.039 --> 16:01.472
Oh, thank heavens!

16:01.474 --> 16:04.108
See you later for the good type of sex

16:04.110 --> 16:06.544
we had with Stephen
Miller all of the time.

16:06.546 --> 16:09.514
Wee-oo wee-oo! We are the police!

16:09.516 --> 16:12.016
We would arrest you for murder,
but you're just too cool.

16:12.018 --> 16:14.752
Here, we'll get this
body out of the way. Unh!

16:14.754 --> 16:17.021
Holy hell! What a ripped body!

16:17.023 --> 16:19.723
Weee-oo! Weee-oo!

16:19.725 --> 16:22.726
It's done, sir.

16:23.142 --> 16:24.475
How did he take it?

16:25.056 --> 16:27.041
I know everyone's a little down,

16:27.066 --> 16:29.099
but this is the burden
of being the best.

16:29.101 --> 16:31.701
The Dalai Lama was hated
so much, not a single

16:31.703 --> 16:34.671
Atlantic City T-shirt shop
let him use their bathroom.

16:34.673 --> 16:39.376
But the important thing is,
I'm happy, so everything's fine!

16:39.378 --> 16:40.844
Maybe it's because someone poured

16:40.846 --> 16:42.479
béarnaise sauce into my handbag,

16:42.481 --> 16:44.981
but I'm not feeling the best anymore.

16:44.983 --> 16:46.450
- Join the club, sister.
- Yeah.

16:46.452 --> 16:48.185
There's a steak knife in my leg.

16:48.187 --> 16:50.653
Your only rule is...

16:50.655 --> 16:53.356
if Stephen Miller would have
said it, say the opposite.

16:53.358 --> 16:57.393
I guess his ideas did only make
sense to people hung like him.

16:57.395 --> 17:00.329
Meet my new press
secretary, Stefan Millar.

17:00.331 --> 17:02.131
He's gonna charm the pants off ya,

17:02.133 --> 17:04.700
so leave your pants over there
in the bin marked "pants."

17:04.702 --> 17:06.702
Stefan, how do you feel about the ruling

17:06.704 --> 17:08.971
that the undocumented can't
be detained indefinitely?

17:08.973 --> 17:12.741
Jim... I... am not furious.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.843
And we are not...

17:14.845 --> 17:18.614
planning to rendition the
judges to a black site in Qatar.

17:18.616 --> 17:22.617
Go easy, guys. This is Stefan
Millar, not Stephen Miller.

17:22.619 --> 17:24.986
You can tell because Stefan
didn't just finish eating

17:24.988 --> 17:27.689
a candy bar that I rubbed
on a bathroom floor.

17:27.691 --> 17:29.624
Good one, Mr. President.

17:29.626 --> 17:32.727
When my Grandpa died, I slipped
a stick of gum into his coffin,

17:32.729 --> 17:34.362
then a year later, I dug up the body,

17:34.364 --> 17:36.664
grabbed the stick of gum,
and gave it to Stephen Miller.

17:36.666 --> 17:37.932
He chewed it on camera!

17:39.136 --> 17:41.436
Acosta, you're alright.

17:44.575 --> 17:47.842
I made Palomas, no
thanks to you jerkholes.

17:47.844 --> 17:50.678
God, Mattis! I said I'd help
after my meditation hike!

17:50.680 --> 17:52.080
You just love playing the victim.

17:52.082 --> 17:54.649
Oh, kiss my ass, McMaster.

17:54.651 --> 17:57.219
John Kelly, four star general

17:57.244 --> 17:59.453
of the United States military, retired.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.688
Namaste?

18:00.690 --> 18:02.356
Sorry to bother you, guys.

18:02.358 --> 18:04.258
Me and the fellas were just wondering,

18:04.260 --> 18:06.193
since we're all in Trump's cabinet,

18:06.195 --> 18:07.895
does that mean we're the best?

18:10.834 --> 18:15.003
Not only are you not the best,
but simply by working there

18:15.005 --> 18:16.804
you're guaranteeing your obituaries

18:16.806 --> 18:18.973
will include the word "co-conspirator."

18:18.975 --> 18:20.942
Get the hell out of there
while you can still work

18:20.944 --> 18:23.310
as a graveyard-shift
commentator on Fox Business!

18:27.216 --> 18:30.118
Where are my besties? I want
to watch them fall again.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.719
I'm afraid the whole
cabinet resigned, sir.

18:32.743 --> 18:34.156
_

18:34.157 --> 18:36.257
You sure this isn't a suicide note?

18:36.259 --> 18:37.724
Don't worry. They're alive.

18:37.726 --> 18:39.826
I got like six calls today
from Celebrity Big Brother

18:39.828 --> 18:41.162
checking their references.

18:41.164 --> 18:42.596
This doesn't make sense.

18:42.598 --> 18:44.298
I've always hired the best people,

18:44.300 --> 18:46.567
ever since my days with the Dalai Lama.

18:46.569 --> 18:48.151
Sir, about that...

18:49.143 --> 18:50.904
The bad news is the Dalai Lama

18:50.906 --> 18:52.606
was a vagrant who wore bed sheets

18:52.608 --> 18:54.575
and sold Rubik's Cubes on the boardwalk.

18:54.577 --> 18:56.910
The good news is I got
us a deal on T-shirts

18:56.912 --> 19:00.113
that say "Jersey Girls Aren't
Trash. Trash Gets Taken Out."

19:00.115 --> 19:01.615
If the Times runs this story tomorrow,

19:01.617 --> 19:03.083
it's because someone stole my phone

19:03.085 --> 19:04.685
and texted it to them just now.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.454
Wait. If I hired them and
they're not the best people,

19:07.456 --> 19:10.623
then I might not be the best
person, but I am the best.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.425
This is the sort of paradox
that fake Dalai Lama

19:13.427 --> 19:16.528
would know just the right T-shirt for.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.966
At least the Democrats can't
use my cabinet against me

19:20.968 --> 19:22.768
if I don't have a cabinet anymore.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.303
Democratic strategists

19:24.305 --> 19:26.906
are focus testing their new 2020 slogan,

19:26.908 --> 19:30.339
"Trump's So Lame Even His
Loser Cabinet Ditched Him."

19:30.364 --> 19:31.677
Crap. That's a winner.

19:31.679 --> 19:35.014
Of course, Trump still has
Stefan Millar in his stable.

19:35.016 --> 19:36.982
But for how long?

19:37.621 --> 19:39.451
Why aren't you excited?

19:39.453 --> 19:40.953
You got everything you wanted,

19:40.955 --> 19:43.322
and all you had to
do was sell your soul.

19:43.324 --> 19:44.690
Exactly.

19:44.692 --> 19:47.358
It's Stefan Millar at the
podium, not Stephen Miller.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.028
What's the point if I can't
describe the border wall

19:50.030 --> 19:52.563
in vivid, sexually vulgar detail?

19:52.565 --> 19:55.834
Big, pulsating turrets
quivering with gunfire!

19:55.836 --> 19:57.301
Try not to hurt your new image.

19:57.303 --> 19:58.837
Don't let your mouth write checks

19:58.839 --> 20:01.439
my beard hair glued to
your scalp can't cash.

20:01.441 --> 20:02.841
Compliments of the house,

20:02.843 --> 20:05.910
the finest wine Mexico has to offer.

20:05.912 --> 20:09.280
Mexico... Mexico... Mexico...

20:09.282 --> 20:11.082
Mexico... Mexico...

20:11.084 --> 20:13.218
Oh-hoo-hoo! Those Oaxacan grapes

20:13.220 --> 20:17.255
are bringing sweet nourishment
to tipsy Ted Cruuuzzz!

20:17.257 --> 20:19.323
Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz!

20:19.325 --> 20:20.558
Mexico...

20:20.560 --> 20:23.394
- Mexico... Mexico... Mexico.
- Oh, God.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.129
It's so good!

20:25.131 --> 20:28.132
I'm sorry, Stephen Miller! Aaah!

20:28.134 --> 20:31.935
Ya Boy's so sorry!

20:35.875 --> 20:38.208
Sometimes I stare into the distance,

20:38.210 --> 20:40.344
wondering if, across the world,

20:40.346 --> 20:43.414
there's a little kid in
Birdville staring back at me.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.616
You really miss your cabinet, don't you?

20:45.618 --> 20:48.185
We had one of our best
days together up here.

20:48.187 --> 20:51.021
This is where they all
fell and nearly died.

20:51.023 --> 20:53.324
Hey, Dad. Remember when me and Eric

20:53.326 --> 20:55.025
- were little kids?
- Gross.

20:55.027 --> 20:57.594
Remember what you used to
tell us before we went to bed?

20:57.596 --> 20:58.796
You'd say...

20:58.798 --> 21:00.430
You're nothing without me.

21:00.432 --> 21:04.001
And if I ever die, which I
won't, you'll be nothing again.

21:04.003 --> 21:05.836
Night, Dad!

21:05.838 --> 21:07.637
That kept me going, Dad.

21:07.639 --> 21:09.339
I knew I didn't need to work hard

21:09.341 --> 21:11.041
or have any talent, intelligence,

21:11.043 --> 21:13.043
or even a tolerable personality.

21:13.045 --> 21:14.544
I just needed you.

21:14.546 --> 21:17.247
I wanted to give my
kids the whole world,

21:17.249 --> 21:19.850
and since I am the whole world, I did.

21:19.852 --> 21:22.252
And that's what you should
have done with your cabinet.

21:22.254 --> 21:25.689
To be the best, they don't need
to have faith in themselves.

21:25.691 --> 21:27.958
They just need to have faith in you.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.259
Thanks, Don.

21:29.261 --> 21:31.695
Tell General Kellyanne to
get my cabinet back here

21:31.697 --> 21:34.421
so they can watch the best be the best!

21:35.434 --> 21:36.534
Oh, and Don...

21:37.836 --> 21:39.703
You're still nothing without me.

21:40.505 --> 21:42.673
I know, Dad. I know.

21:50.582 --> 21:54.617
Hey! Try using a star
of David to dot the I.

21:54.619 --> 21:56.753
- That's a really cool idea, man.
- _

21:56.755 --> 21:59.288
Hey, you look like Stephen
Miller. You know that guy?

21:59.290 --> 22:01.991
He was one of the most
talented bigots in the game.

22:01.993 --> 22:03.492
I wonder whatever happened to him.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.241
So do I.

22:05.266 --> 22:07.529
He used to eat at the
Shakey's where I worked.

22:07.531 --> 22:10.632
Man, we'd all compete to
see how much of our insides

22:10.634 --> 22:12.334
we could get onto each slice.

22:12.336 --> 22:14.503
Still, hell of a racist, though.

22:17.608 --> 22:19.241
They're not coming, are they?

22:19.243 --> 22:21.710
Trust me, Mr. President,
they'll be here.

22:21.712 --> 22:22.878
Did I win?!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.279
Is this the championship episode?!

22:24.281 --> 22:27.148
None of you losers are
contestants on The Amazing Race.

22:27.150 --> 22:28.484
I lied to get you here.

22:28.486 --> 22:29.785
- Aww!
- That stinks.

22:29.787 --> 22:33.355
A vagrant with IBS who I
thought was the Dalai Lama

22:33.357 --> 22:35.757
taught me about the dichotomy of man.

22:35.759 --> 22:39.361
Just like a Rubik's Cube can
be both solved and unsolved

22:39.363 --> 22:41.096
if you never take it out of the box,

22:41.098 --> 22:44.399
an employee can be both
the best and the worst.

22:44.401 --> 22:46.634
Without me, you're all the worst,

22:46.636 --> 22:49.204
but you're all the best because of me.

22:49.206 --> 22:50.772
And now I'll prove it...

22:50.774 --> 22:53.808
by walking to the Washington Monument!

22:53.810 --> 22:55.843
Tell my wife she loves me!

22:55.845 --> 22:57.145
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, he's really doing it!

22:57.147 --> 22:59.214
Is the Secret Service
really allowing this?

23:00.884 --> 23:04.752
I'm comin' home, Birdville Boy.

23:15.886 --> 23:18.465
Fake... news?

23:19.416 --> 23:22.469
Who had June for Trump toppling
the Washington Monument?

23:22.471 --> 23:24.538
- That was me! Pay up.
- Aww.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.073
Oh, man.

23:26.075 --> 23:28.375
I hope the people at
the top of that monument

23:28.377 --> 23:29.977
had their seatbelts on.

23:30.316 --> 23:31.593
What the!

23:31.618 --> 23:33.690
God, I'm so friggin' embarrassed.

23:33.715 --> 23:36.750
Someone do something! Where's Stefan?!

23:37.740 --> 23:40.354
Stefan can't help you, Mr. President,

23:40.356 --> 23:43.190
but I know someone who can!

23:43.592 --> 23:46.159
This is Stephen Miller!

23:46.161 --> 23:48.695
The President's life
has been put in danger

23:48.697 --> 23:50.964
by this Mexican manufactured tightrope

23:50.966 --> 23:53.399
which was clearly sabotaged!

23:53.401 --> 23:55.802
Just as Mexicans have sabotaged

23:55.804 --> 23:57.938
the dream of millions of Americans

23:57.940 --> 24:02.175
to get a job debeaking
chickens at a factory farm!

24:02.177 --> 24:06.980
We must retaliate against this
hostile act with military might!

24:06.982 --> 24:09.082
Breaking news. Stephen
Miller has announced

24:09.084 --> 24:12.486
the administration has
declared war on Mexico,

24:12.488 --> 24:15.188
causing viewers to seek comfort

24:15.190 --> 24:18.123
in the folds of my deeply furrowed brow.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.960
It's good to have you all back.

24:20.962 --> 24:22.294
I'm glad you've come to see

24:22.296 --> 24:24.997
that because I'm the best, you are, too.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.466
Also, all the job interviews we went on

24:27.468 --> 24:30.402
ended up being really
violent YouTube pranks.

24:30.404 --> 24:32.905
I want to especially
commend Stefan Millar

24:32.907 --> 24:34.473
who changed the conversation

24:34.475 --> 24:36.876
about me destroying a national monument

24:36.878 --> 24:39.845
by launching a debate
over an unnecessary war.

24:39.847 --> 24:42.414
Actually, sir, it was I, Stephen Miller!

24:42.416 --> 24:45.384
I was Stefan Millar the whole time.

24:45.386 --> 24:47.252
Got it. Fire Stefan Millar

24:47.254 --> 24:49.220
for leaving me out to dry last night.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.488
Right away, sir!

24:50.490 --> 24:53.758
Stefan, en garde!
Shing! Ting! Wing! Ting!

24:53.760 --> 24:55.359
Hello, boys!

24:55.361 --> 24:58.229
Ah. My insatiable maidens have returned!

24:58.254 --> 24:59.397
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

24:59.399 --> 25:01.165
Just like old times,

25:01.167 --> 25:04.669
with a nice cozy uncontrolled
fire to keep us warm.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.773
I think Wilbur Ross just
died of smoke inhalation!

25:08.775 --> 25:10.041
What should we do?!

25:10.043 --> 25:11.910
Ooh! Ooh! Let's chop
up his corpse and mix it

25:11.912 --> 25:13.411
into Stephen Miller's food!

25:13.413 --> 25:14.933
Yay!

26:13.972 --> 26:15.039
Trump!
