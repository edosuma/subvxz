Oh, look, look, look, look.

00:06.834 --> 00:08.041
This is a show
called<i> Fruitville Friends. </i>

00:08.125 --> 00:09.667
Looks pretty dumb,
but your dad says

00:09.750 --> 00:10.875

Banana, yippee-yo, yippee-yay.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.417

by Snoop Dogg?

CrossFruit.

CrossFruit.

00:37.625 --> 00:40.625

that's just for adults.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.792

on purpose.

It's the same ending
as<i> The Sopranos. </i>

01:29.625 --> 01:31.500
My trouble is, you know,
figuring out a way

01:31.583 --> 01:33.959

01:34.041 --> 01:36.166

that's super romantic.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:32.959 --> 08:34.291
I'm so proud of you.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.291
Oh, whoa.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.333
Did you hear that?

08:36.417 --> 08:37.625
She wants to use
him for his body.

08:37.709 --> 08:38.875
(all cheering)

08:38.959 --> 08:41.333
But I want to use me
for my heart, too.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.750
(all booing)

08:42.834 --> 08:43.875
What...?

08:43.959 --> 08:45.834
I'm just not sure I can
turn off my feelings.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.333
Well, it's simple--
listen to your instincts

08:47.417 --> 08:48.709
and go the exact opposite.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.250
What are your instincts
telling you?

08:50.333 --> 08:51.834
Um, come here and have Ravi

08:51.917 --> 08:53.333
help me bake a loaf
of fresh bread for Vanessa?

08:53.417 --> 08:55.333
Terrible idea.
Don't do that.

08:55.417 --> 08:56.500
(phone chimes)

08:56.583 --> 08:57.834
Oh, maybe it's Heidi.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.417
Yes.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.458
Nice, Dad!

09:02.542 --> 09:04.166
No, not nice.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.583
Why not?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.291
I mean, she's definitely
gonna let you know.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.166
And knowing's
half the battle.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.792
See, she's saying she's busy.

09:11.875 --> 09:13.375
Fake enthusiasm.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.041
(groans)
Exclamation points.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.667
That's a textbook blow-off.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.208
Everything okay, Jimmy?

09:18.291 --> 09:20.000
What?
Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.291
Well, it sounds like she
really loved my meat loaf.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.375
Maybe I should
make a run at her.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.417
Heidi turned me down
for a second date.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.834
Yeah, that's
what I said would happen.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.375
Look at me--
I'm a wreck.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.041
I'm binging on ice cream.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.458
That's
not ice cream.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.375
That's a tiny fat-free
Italian ice.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.834
And stop
acting heartbroken.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.041
You only like Heidi

09:41.125 --> 09:42.166
because she doesn't like you.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.166
That's not true!

09:43.250 --> 09:44.417
She's different.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.917
She's smart.
She's accomplished.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.208
What the heck's
the matter with her?

09:48.291 --> 09:50.417
What?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.625
Sorry if I came across
as an arrogant,

09:52.709 --> 09:54.417
flashy dope last night.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.417
Hey, give me that!
What are you doing?!
Just...

09:56.500 --> 09:58.208
(phone chimes)

09:59.959 --> 10:01.417
Ah...

10:01.500 --> 10:04.792
I would love to start over.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.083
Dinner tonight?

10:08.792 --> 10:11.709
(phone chimes)
Hey!

10:11.792 --> 10:13.000
There you go.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.250
Godspeed.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.417
What magic was that?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.417
Wait, don't go!

10:20.500 --> 10:22.041
(stammers)
Now what do I do?

10:22.125 --> 10:23.417
I can't help you.
I have an errand to run.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.667
All right,
I'll go with you.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.083
Really?
Yep.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.458
Got another shot at this.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.166
I don't want
to blow it again.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.083
Where's the errand?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.458
Palm Springs.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.125
<i>Palm Springs,</i>
Palm Springs?

10:36.041 --> 10:37.458
All right, got this.
Be cool.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.542
It's just casual sex.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.458
Wow, you look...
(clears his throat)

10:43.542 --> 10:45.834
So, you're just not gonna
finish that sentence?

10:45.917 --> 10:48.041
So?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.458
I didn't bake you any bread.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.750
Um, okay.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.166
That's right.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.458
No bread, just sex.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.000
Got it, pal?

10:55.083 --> 10:57.166
Are you broken?
What's happening?

10:57.250 --> 10:59.333
What's happening is that
I'm gonna obliterate you.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.375
(stammers)
I'm sorry.

11:01.458 --> 11:02.417
I'm just trying

11:02.500 --> 11:03.542
to fight my instincts here.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.959
I'm-I'm a bit of a romantic.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.917
Just relax, okay?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.291
Be yourself.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.583
Yeah.
Okay. (beep)

11:10.667 --> 11:12.000
("Eternal Flame" playing)

11:12.083 --> 11:13.083
Um, yeah.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.500
You know, I just got a text.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.041
My mom.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.875
She wants me
to go pick up Edie.

11:17.959 --> 11:20.542
Maybe we try
this again later, maybe.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.792
♪ Do you... ♪

11:23.875 --> 11:26.458
What is wrong with me?!

11:26.542 --> 11:29.542
JIMMY:
<i>Come on, your friends with her.</i>

11:29.625 --> 11:31.041
Tell me what to do
on the date tonight.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.500
Give me some bullet points.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.083
No, there are no bullet
points, I'm sorry.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.458
You want me to drop you
off at the outlets?

11:35.542 --> 11:36.500
You know what it is?

11:36.583 --> 11:37.959
You don't want
to give me advice,

11:38.041 --> 11:39.417
because you don't
want me to find anyone.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.625
(laughs)
Yeah, that's right.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.500
I just want to keep
you all to myself.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.250
Turn this air on.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.250
My-my sweat is
staining out my shirt.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.500
Okay, wait, now, don't
turn it above two

11:47.583 --> 11:49.041
or the car will blow up.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.500
(groans)

11:50.583 --> 11:51.875
Why are we going
to Palm Springs anyway?

11:51.959 --> 11:53.166
I got to get back.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.875
I am going to Palm Springs

11:54.959 --> 11:56.667
because of a lovely woman
from the Internet

11:56.750 --> 11:58.375
who is selling the exact
hand wheel clutch

11:58.458 --> 11:59.583
I need for my
sewing machine.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.208
You know what I just heard--
grandma, grandma,

12:01.291 --> 12:02.667
hand wheel clutch, grandma,
grandma, machine.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.333
Yeah, well, see?

12:04.417 --> 12:05.667
That's the difference
between you and me.

12:05.750 --> 12:06.959
I own who I am.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.542
I am a grandmother.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.542
Clearly, your blinker's
been on for 25 minutes.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.542
Yeah, well, good,
because we're just about

12:12.625 --> 12:14.083
to make a turn
in 40 miles.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.792
Ah-ha, ah-ha.
You know what?

12:15.875 --> 12:17.500
This is your problem
with Heidi.

12:17.583 --> 12:18.542
What?

12:18.625 --> 12:20.333
You are obsessed
with presenting

12:20.417 --> 12:22.667
this perfect image,
instead of being authentic.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.500
Really?
Yeah, your clothing,

12:24.583 --> 12:25.709
your personality,

12:25.792 --> 12:27.667
that ridiculous story
that you always tell

12:27.750 --> 12:29.709
about why you can't
be around dogs.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.583
That is a real story.
No.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.834
And a fan favorite.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.583
Please, you actually
pulled a stray dog

12:34.667 --> 12:36.166
Mm-hmm.
out of a storm drain

12:36.250 --> 12:37.542
Mm-hmm.

12:37.625 --> 12:38.709
and bottle fed it
all night?

12:38.792 --> 12:40.458
Yes, and I held it
in my arms until he died.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.834
Dr. Kirkbaum said
he had dog cancer.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.917
After little Blackie, I refuse
to get attached to any other...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.917
Okay, it's fake.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.208
Ha! I knew it!

12:48.291 --> 12:49.417
You're ridiculous.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.834
You're ridiculous.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.917
Look, how do you expect
to find your Amal

12:53.000 --> 12:55.291
if you can't even be real?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.792
You're always Mr. Never
Let Them See You Sweat.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.625
No, that's your own personal axe
to grind with me.

13:00.709 --> 13:02.000
Hey, look, you
asked my advice.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.083
You jumped in my car.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.458
Your hot car.

13:04.542 --> 13:05.792
Is it hot?
Yeah.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.542
I mean,
let's turn this thing up.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.333
Don't do that.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.291
I said don't put it above two.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.542
It's-it's two and a half,
it's...

13:17.583 --> 13:19.834
(steam hissing)

13:19.917 --> 13:22.333
JIMMY:<i> I'm guessing you're </i>
<i>not pulling over to make out.</i>

13:25.959 --> 13:28.333
Yep, just what I thought.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.000
Looks like it was the dumbass
standing next to me.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.041
Here.
(clears his throat)

13:32.125 --> 13:34.000
Will this help?

13:34.083 --> 13:37.625
You are unbelievable.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.083
All right, stand back.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.875
Please.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.500
All right, yeah.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.792
Interesting.
Interesting.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.834
Are you just using
the hood for shade?

13:47.917 --> 13:49.500
Well, I do have a date tonight.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.959
Okay, see that
silver cap?
Yeah.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.625
All right, unscrew that and
tell me if it's empty in there.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.041
Give me your shirt.
What?!

13:56.125 --> 13:58.792
I need a rag.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.667
It's not a shirt.
(gasps)

14:00.750 --> 14:03.542
All right, I'll be
the bigger man here.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.333
(steam hissing)

14:05.417 --> 14:07.542
Aha!

14:07.625 --> 14:09.041
Empty.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.125
Thank you.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.458
Come on.
Where we going?

14:14.542 --> 14:18.125
We need coolant, and there's
a gas station two miles up.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.875
Are you using me
for shade?

14:22.959 --> 14:26.333
Well, you were blessed with
a big head. Share your gift.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.125
Come on. Come on, race
you there. Come on!

14:34.709 --> 14:36.291
Hey.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.083
Hey, are you sure
you want to try this again?

14:39.166 --> 14:40.792
(laughing):
Oh, oh!

14:44.417 --> 14:46.750
I think I can smell wine
coming out of your pores.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.375
How many glasses did
you have last night?

14:48.458 --> 14:50.083
How many are
in two bottles?

14:50.166 --> 14:52.542
What? Grandmas like
their Chardonnay.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.083
Come on,
pick up the pace.

14:55.166 --> 14:57.375
My legs are cramping. I'm
hungry. Do you have food?

14:57.458 --> 14:58.959
I have a granola bar.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.750
How much sugar
does it have in it?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.125
(groans)
What?

15:02.208 --> 15:04.500
(laughs)
What are you
laughing at?

15:04.583 --> 15:06.250
Look at you!

15:06.333 --> 15:08.583
You remember
<i>Rambo III?</i>
Of course.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.083
Okay, remember
how you thought

15:10.166 --> 15:12.542
that was gonna be the movie
of the century?
Was.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.500
You made us camp
outside the theater

15:14.583 --> 15:17.125
for, like, 18 hours
in that hot little tent.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.417
Uh-huh, I remember.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.125
You got so gross
and sweaty.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.166
Worth it.
No, it was not
worth it.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.500
No one else camped out,
and that theater was empty.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.125
(laughter)

15:27.208 --> 15:29.125
My point is,
you're kind of reminding me

15:29.208 --> 15:30.792
of that sweaty tent guy.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.583
In a good way.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.709
You know, it's nice to see you
a little rough around the edges.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.125
Thank you.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.208
You know, it's
difficult for me because

15:39.291 --> 15:41.583
the women I date expect a
certain level of polish.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.125
Oh, shut up!
Gas station!

15:43.208 --> 15:45.125
(groans)

15:45.208 --> 15:48.792
That is not a sincere offer.

15:48.875 --> 15:52.000
All right, so, uh, when
do you want to meet up again?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.125
Hold on. When did you
get so good at this?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.125
Well, I found a way
to get my emotions

15:56.208 --> 15:57.875
out of my system
before you came over.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.166
Yeah, first,
I watched some videos

15:59.250 --> 16:00.500
of soldiers reuniting
with their dogs.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.041
Cried my eyes out.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.166
Then, I busted out
some videos of deaf people

16:04.250 --> 16:06.083
hearing for the first time?
Cried even more.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.750
I'm dead inside.
Cool. I just
watch porn.

16:08.834 --> 16:12.125
Think you got another round
in you before Edie's up?

16:12.208 --> 16:13.458
Yeah, you bet.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.166
Just gonna watch
Susan Boyle's first audition,

16:15.250 --> 16:16.417
and I'll be right back.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.792
(roars)
Yeah.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.166
You know what? I'm gonna...
I'm gonna stay here.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.166
You go inside
and get the coolant.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.959
What? Why?

16:33.291 --> 16:35.333
Well, because of
the dog? Seriously?

16:35.417 --> 16:37.709
Yes.
Well...

16:37.792 --> 16:38.834
(whining)

16:38.917 --> 16:40.875
Oh, my God, run!
Really?

16:40.959 --> 16:43.875
No! It's a basset hound,
and it's on a pink leash.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.792
I'm afraid
of dogs, okay?

16:45.875 --> 16:48.458
That's why I don't want
to be around 'em.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.208
There was no Blackie. There was
a Pumpkin, and he bit me.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.417
I was at a Little League game,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.083
taking a leak
behind the bleachers.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.208
And all of a sudden, out
of nowhere, this dog comes up

16:56.291 --> 16:57.458
and bites me
right in the ass.

16:57.542 --> 17:00.458
Yikes.
I ran off
with a...

17:00.542 --> 17:03.000
with my pants around my ankles,
crying like a baby.

17:03.083 --> 17:06.208
The whole team laughed at me.
It was awful.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.166
See, I knew I shouldn't have
told you that story.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.750
Come on. We'll go in together.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.667
Uh-uh.
(laughing):
Come on.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.625
Oh, hell.

17:14.709 --> 17:16.166
Yeah.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.375
(dog whining)

17:17.458 --> 17:19.083
Okay. Okay.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.333
(rattling door loudly)

17:20.417 --> 17:21.834
It's locked!
It's locked!

17:21.917 --> 17:24.166
It's a push.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.500
Okay, speaking
of bull crap stories,

17:28.583 --> 17:30.041
you did not sleep with Madonna
right before we started dating.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.250
I slept with Taylor Dayne.
Same thing.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.709
(laughing)

17:33.792 --> 17:35.542
Hey, look at us, huh?

17:35.625 --> 17:37.041
We, uh, repaired a car.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.709
We walked through
the desert.

17:38.792 --> 17:41.917
Got your weird
Grandma sewing thing.
Yay!

17:42.000 --> 17:45.500
All in time for me
to make my date.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.125
Okay, you asked
for bullet points.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.625
Here they are.

17:50.709 --> 17:52.166
Okay, good.
Be a real person.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.417
Got it. Be a real person.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.792
Listen to her answers.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.417
Right.
And if you want

17:57.500 --> 17:59.417
extra credit, give her a call
after the date

17:59.500 --> 18:01.208
and tell her
you had a nice time.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.917
I went all the way
to the desert for that?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.458
(laughs)
Get out.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.875
Okay. Thank you.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.041
Yeah.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.792
Oh. Fist grab.
Weird.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.166
That feels right.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.709
Have a good night.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.166
Yup. You, too.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.792
(door opens, closes)

18:18.875 --> 18:20.667
(both sigh deeply)

18:20.750 --> 18:24.583
(laughs)
Uh, dude, we are crushing
this sex pals thing.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.500
Thank you, Susan Boyle.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.834
Yeah, it's not over yet.
You ready to go again?

18:28.917 --> 18:30.875
(loud explosion)

18:30.959 --> 18:32.917
(loud explosion)

18:33.000 --> 18:35.750
Wait. What is that?
Is that a bat?!

18:35.834 --> 18:37.125
I definitely
don't play baseball.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.291
Did you bring that from home?

18:39.375 --> 18:42.959
(hissing, laughing)

18:43.041 --> 18:46.417
What are they doing?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.917
She's a junior,
so... go Jordan.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.792
(explosion, laughter)

18:50.875 --> 18:54.583
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.417
They do everything
together.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.792
(laughter)

19:00.875 --> 19:03.375
Oh!

19:03.458 --> 19:05.792
Ugh. Damn it.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.917
What?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.792
I'm thinking about Jordan
and his girlfriend,

19:11.875 --> 19:14.417
and I'm thinking maybe I might
want what those dorks have--

19:14.500 --> 19:15.959
a real relationship.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.333
That's all I've ever wanted.

19:18.417 --> 19:21.917
You know, we'd be a real,
normal family.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.792
Uh, but.. what if
things end badly

19:25.875 --> 19:27.667
like every relationship
I've ever had?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.834
And what if we end up
hating each other,

19:29.917 --> 19:31.834
like every relationship
I've ever had?

19:31.917 --> 19:34.834
We'd be one of those families
that drops their kid off

19:34.917 --> 19:38.208
at each other's houses without
saying a word to each other.

19:41.041 --> 19:44.041
We can't do
this, can we?

19:44.125 --> 19:47.834
So... friends
without benefits?

19:47.917 --> 19:50.417
Friends without
benefits.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.834
One last benefit
wouldn't hurt anyone.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.291
I'm gonna
obliterate you.
Oh, good.

20:06.917 --> 20:12.417

You know, a wise woman told me
to call someone

20:38.166 --> 20:40.750
to let 'em know I had
a nice time with them, so, uh,

20:40.834 --> 20:43.875
this is me calling to say
that I had a good time with you.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.166
You know my number.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.750
How did your date go?

20:46.834 --> 20:48.041
It was okay. I mean...

20:48.125 --> 20:49.875
I don't think I found my Amal.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.083
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.625
It's all right.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.583
My Amal is out there somewhere.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.125
Hope you don't mind,
I used your shampoo.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.792
And your conditioner,

20:57.875 --> 20:59.917
and your volumizer,
and your finishing rinse.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.709
Heidi's at your place?!

21:01.792 --> 21:03.208
Oh, just 'cause
she's not my Amal

21:03.291 --> 21:04.625
doesn't mean
she can't be my Taylor Dayne.

21:04.709 --> 21:06.375
Oh, my God.
Bye.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.333
Who were you on the phone with?
