00:01.601 --> 00:04.161
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:04.270 --> 00:07.000
- This from your dream?
- I think it's a memory.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.301
- Hi.
- I know you.

00:10.377 --> 00:13.540
You probably recognize me
from patrolling the neighborhood.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.605
We got a problem.
He's starting to remember.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.151
You've been a really good friend
to me lately.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.779
And if you need someone
to be that for you...

00:23.623 --> 00:25.113
...I'm here.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.795
- Do you think you've seen it before?
- No.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.798
If anyone could get
a Ouija board to work, it's him.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.893
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.
What does it mean?

00:38.605 --> 00:41.665
<i>- What's wrong?
- Police have identified</i>

00:41.741 --> 00:43.902
<i>the remains found last month
as William Kern.</i>

00:44.010 --> 00:45.102
That's him.

00:45.178 --> 00:48.545
<i>A professor of biochemistry
at the University of Washington.</i>

00:48.648 --> 00:52.379
Maybe Kern was his teacher
and if Kyle witnessed his murder...

00:52.452 --> 00:55.012
You're drawing conclusions
before there's evidence.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.352
Kyle drew that picture
before he knew Kern was missing.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.950
You can't tell me
that's a coincidence.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.699
Kyle, hypnosis relaxes you.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.428
It allows you to focus very deeply.

01:09.502 --> 01:13.063
Dr. Cassidy has helped some of my
patients make sense of their dreams.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.664
And by tapping into your subconscious,

01:15.742 --> 01:18.905
hypnosis can unlock memories
you've lost or suppressed.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.246
What are we waiting for?

01:30.790 --> 01:35.727
Kyle, you're walking down the steps
of a long staircase.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.320
And with each step,

01:38.398 --> 01:42.528
you find yourself
relaxing more and more,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.866
letting every muscle relax.

01:44.938 --> 01:50.035
The staircase winds around
until you come upon a door.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.876
Now gently turn the knob
and ease the door open.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.177
Step inside.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.682
Kyle, where are you now?

02:02.989 --> 02:04.286
In a car.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.955
- It's raining.
- Whose car is it?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.826
- I don't know.
- Are you alone?

02:15.802 --> 02:20.171
A man. Professor Kern.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.674
He's looking in.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.480
- He's hurting him!
- Who, Kyle?

02:29.549 --> 02:31.813
Who hurt Professor Kern?

02:37.056 --> 02:38.683
Foss!

02:42.862 --> 02:44.420
Jacob...

02:44.531 --> 02:47.091
I want you
to leave that place now.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.864
- Tell me what happened before.
- Before?

02:50.937 --> 02:55.636
Before you were in the car in the rain.
Tell me what you remember.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.716
Go deeper now, Kyle.
You're at another door.

03:08.788 --> 03:12.349
Open it and look inside at your past.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.326
There are images and sounds.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.363
Describe them to me.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.263
Kyle, what do you remember?

03:28.308 --> 03:31.471
- What is that?
- I don't know.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.475
Jacob, take him out of this.

03:36.583 --> 03:41.350
Kyle, go back to the door
and up the stairs.

03:41.454 --> 03:45.515
When I snap my fingers,
you'll be safe in this room.

03:45.592 --> 03:49.119
- Bring him out, now.
- One, two, three.

04:16.555 --> 04:19.047
I've never come across
anyone like him.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.753
Beyond the images Kyle described
from that night,

04:21.827 --> 04:23.989
he couldn't retrieve even one memory.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.760
Well, he's blocked.
I told you, his amnesia is severe.

04:27.834 --> 04:31.497
Nicole, I think you need to consider
another diagnosis.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.540
Kyle shows clear signs
of delusions and paranoia.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.873
No. He's not schizophrenic.
I've been treating Kyle for months.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.708
He's sensitive to others.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.511
He communicates, participates. No.

04:44.584 --> 04:49.351
And his fixation on Professor Kern?
Police determined there's no connection.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.891
But I still believe there is one.
We just haven't found it yet.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.689
And his fears about
your security guard, Tom Foss?

04:55.762 --> 04:57.423
That's not paranoia?

04:57.497 --> 05:00.557
I think Tom Foss,
as an authority figure,

05:00.633 --> 05:03.397
represents someone disturbing
from Kyle's past.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.405
And that gibberish,
you've never heard that before?

05:07.473 --> 05:09.168
No.

05:09.242 --> 05:13.576
No, but it could be a product
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.513
I mean, Kyle let out a string
of nonsense syllables,

05:16.582 --> 05:18.880
like a cathartic release.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.551
Well, that's
as good a guess as any.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.890
<i>In the trance,
I approached a door to my past,</i>

05:31.964 --> 05:35.422
<i>but the door was locked.
I longed for the key,</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:38.163
<i>for a moment of clear understanding.</i>

05:40.573 --> 05:42.666
<i>But with every detour and dead end,</i>

05:42.742 --> 05:45.267
<i>it grew harder to stay optimistic.</i>

05:48.581 --> 05:52.608
Two years till we graduate, my dad's
already on me about applying to college.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.052
He's got his checkbook out,
to buy me into the school of my choice.

05:56.122 --> 05:59.558
I think my parents started saving
the second I left the womb.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.356
Kyle, what's up?

06:02.495 --> 06:04.224
So how'd it go today?

06:04.897 --> 06:07.127
I guess I shouldn't expect so much.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.360
I told you.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.163
Those hypnotists are bogus.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.295
Josh, that door is there for a reason.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.930
It's open.

06:14.474 --> 06:18.240
So did he make you cluck
like a chicken?

06:18.344 --> 06:20.778
Get out!

06:21.948 --> 06:24.314
One thing I will not miss
when I go to college.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.079
- You're going to college?
- Eventually.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.554
Declan is already being recruited.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.318
Couple of scouts saw me play,
from Whitman and U-Dub.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.952
- U-Dub?
- University of Washington.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.792
The assistant coach keeps calling,
so I thought I'd drive over tomorrow.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.196
Take me with you.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.598
I thought you were done
playing basketball.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.569
That's where Professor Kern taught.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.198
The guy whose skeleton
they found in the woods.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.538
If you want to come, Kyle,
I'm fine with it.

06:50.610 --> 06:54.273
Kyle, you can't drive to U-Dub
with Declan. My parents won't let you.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.481
You haven't established yourself
as a trustworthy person.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.745
- That really hurts.
- But I have to go.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.414
If I knew Professor Kern,
someone there might know who I am.

07:04.524 --> 07:08.688
- If my mom hears you wanna go...
- She wants me to figure things out.

07:08.795 --> 07:12.356
That doesn't include snooping around
about some dead professor.

07:18.304 --> 07:22.866
You should've seen Kyle's reaction. The
anxiety, when he talked about Tom Foss,

07:22.942 --> 07:25.274
as if he was
really re-living the experience.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.074
And what, even under hypnosis,
there's still no clue

07:28.147 --> 07:30.308
- why Kyle had those flashes about him?
- No.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.111
And they're so vivid.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.154
I know Foss is just a replacement
for someone, but still,

07:35.254 --> 07:38.087
it makes Kyle anxious
to have him around.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.318
You're not gonna have to
worry about that.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.658
- I called Palisade Security today.
- You got him fired?

07:43.729 --> 07:46.254
Not quite.
They agreed to take him off our detail.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.267
Well, I guess a transfer to Alaska
was out of the question,

07:49.335 --> 07:51.565
but still it's a relief. Thank you.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.400
Oh, please. Not near my food.

07:55.374 --> 07:56.466
Hey.

07:57.710 --> 08:00.941
Hey. Kyle, sorry it didn't work out
this morning.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.846
- It was worth a try.
- Well, I'm glad you're not discouraged.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.016
I think Kyle needs a break
from all this stuff.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.921
Declan's checking Whitman tomorrow.
I thought I'd go,

08:11.991 --> 08:13.618
and Kyle's welcome to come.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.389
- I thought Declan was going...
- Invite you himself?

08:16.462 --> 08:18.623
He meant to,
so I'm asking you for him.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.428
- Why are you being so nice to him?
- Yes, why are you?

08:22.101 --> 08:26.265
You make it sound
like I'm this horrible person.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.068
- Forget it. I don't have to take him.
- But I want to go.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.244
I'd like to see the school.

08:33.546 --> 08:36.174
Give him one day
and he'll come back with a diploma.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.615
Well, what do you think?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.811
Bring me back a Whitman T-shirt.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.587
You wanted to go to U-Dub, didn't you?

08:51.664 --> 08:53.825
I don't like
making up stories for them.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.391
Well, that's why I did it.
You can thank me later.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.937
Hey, you ready to roll?

09:02.008 --> 09:03.737
Once and for all, you can find out

09:03.809 --> 09:05.970
if those dreams
that you're having are real.

09:10.516 --> 09:11.949
Let's go.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.256
Welcome to U-Dub.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.417
Does anything look familiar?

09:53.492 --> 09:55.824
- No.
- Not yet.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.952
- Mrs. Trager, hi.
- Hello.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.519
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just came by

10:31.597 --> 10:34.361
to make sure that everything's OK.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.093
Everything's fine.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.528
Well, I guess I mean...

10:40.139 --> 10:43.802
Well, I know that you folks
requested to have my detail switched

10:45.044 --> 10:48.980
and I just wanted to make sure that
I hadn't done anything to upset you.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.779
We just felt that
it wasn't a good match here.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.820
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.014
Because I have to say that...

10:59.825 --> 11:02.123
...I admire you, Mrs. Trager. I do.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.493
The way that you balance
your career with your family

11:05.564 --> 11:09.295
and a foster child on top of that.
I mean, it's a lot to handle.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.529
I really respect that.

11:12.972 --> 11:16.931
Even though I'm not on your watch
anymore, I just want you to know that

11:17.043 --> 11:19.705
you can call on me
if you ever need anything.

11:21.147 --> 11:24.844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Goodbye.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.059
Check it out.
We're in college, Trager.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.901
Then why do I feel like I have
"high school" written all over me?

11:46.972 --> 11:50.464
- Kyle, where are you going?
- To the science building.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.308
Hang on, where's the gym?

11:53.379 --> 11:57.509
Take that path, left at the commons,
then straight for an eighth of a mile.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.813
You already memorized the campus?

12:00.419 --> 12:02.284
You're like a walking navi-system.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.687
So let's hook up in a couple of hours.
By the student union?

12:06.058 --> 12:09.186
Sure. Think you can find it?

12:30.182 --> 12:31.547
This is it.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.225
Can I help you?

12:47.333 --> 12:50.791
- Hi. I'm Lori Trager. This is Kyle.
- Hello.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.463
We were told this is
Professor Kern's office?

12:54.540 --> 12:55.802
It was.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.242
Well, we think Kyle might have
known the professor.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.576
- May have?
- I'm not sure if I did.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.574
Kyle has amnesia. Seriously.

13:05.651 --> 13:09.018
And one of the few people
he seems to remember is Professor Kern.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.851
Uh-huh.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.915
I know this sounds out-there,

13:13.025 --> 13:15.960
but we were hoping being here
might help Kyle remember.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.826
Do you know me?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.741
I'm sorry, no.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.379
I'm Anna Manfredi. I'm...

13:35.047 --> 13:37.345
I was Professor Kern's
research assistant.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.908
Can I ask, what exactly
was he researching?

13:40.986 --> 13:44.114
Essentially, he was interested
in maximizing brainpower.

13:45.558 --> 13:49.927
Professor Kern developed theories
covering areas of creative thinking,

13:49.995 --> 13:54.056
problem-solving, memory,
logical thought and mental agility.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.194
- I've done some reading.
- The thing is, Kyle is smart.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.431
Like Einstein-smart.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.475
He had an MRI and it showed
a high level of brain activity.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.808
We were thinking maybe Kyle worked with
the professor, which could explain...

14:07.880 --> 14:10.747
I did all of William's...
Professor Kern's testing.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.284
I would've known
if Kyle were involved.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.014
But I had to be.
There has to be a connection.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.148
- It's the only thing that makes sense.
- I'm sorry.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.453
Test me now.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.329
I'll take all of his tests
and you'll see.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.863
All right, thanks.
I appreciate it.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.940
Uh-oh, this can't be good.

14:37.009 --> 14:40.308
Well, actually, that was good news.
That was Detective Breen.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.907
I asked him to run a background check
on Foss and it came up clean.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.077
I should never have told you.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.120
Nicole, I had him taken off our watch,

14:49.188 --> 14:51.816
then he shows up at the door
to question you about it?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.552
But he wasn't hostile.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.493
I mean, it was more like concern.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.030
He can keep his concern.
I don't want him around.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.656
He makes me uncomfortable.

15:00.766 --> 15:03.394
But he's never actually
done anything wrong.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.303
Kyle's having nightmares about him,
and he's got good instincts,

15:07.373 --> 15:10.433
so if Foss spooks him,
that's reason enough for me.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.314
Heads-up!

15:24.223 --> 15:26.691
- Sweet catch.
- Thanks.

15:28.427 --> 15:32.193
- Your throw could use some work.
- I skipped Intro to Frisbee.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.789
That's too bad.
I happen to teach that class.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.898
- I'm Wes, by the way.
- Lori.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.200
- You go here?
- Just visiting.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.297
What do you think so far?

15:45.244 --> 15:49.010
- Hey.
- Hey. Declan, this is Wes.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.173
- What's up?
- How's it going?

15:52.151 --> 15:54.016
Well, I should get back to the game.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.719
Give it up.

15:58.557 --> 16:02.721
- So how'd it go with Kyle?
- Let's go find out.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.376
This is taking forever.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.419
He's... extraordinary.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.149
Kyle's results are
so far beyond the normal range.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.159
I showed him 100 images
in 60 seconds.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.685
He was able to remember
all 100 of them.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.765
- Not bad for a guy with no memory.
- Declan.

17:50.936 --> 17:54.372
Don't you think it's possible
he worked with Professor Kern?

17:54.440 --> 17:58.001
I suppose, but William would have
shared these results.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.945
His best test case, even with repeated
practice, could only identify 37 images.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.173
What is he looking at?

18:06.251 --> 18:09.015
They're pictures and awards
of students and faculty.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.248
Kyle?

18:13.192 --> 18:14.523
What is it?

18:20.332 --> 18:21.629
It's you.

18:23.302 --> 18:27.466
- No, impossible. Check the date.
- 1985?

18:40.385 --> 18:42.649
<i>So how's Whitman?
They kick you out yet?</i>

18:42.721 --> 18:44.416
Josh, just put Mom or Dad on.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.459
You don't really think you can
get in there, do you?

18:47.526 --> 18:48.686
Josh.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.922
Your grades are lame.
You've got no after-school activities

18:51.997 --> 18:54.465
and there's really nothing
special about you.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.694
- Josh!
- What's the matter with you?

18:57.669 --> 19:01.036
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad, we're having a cool time.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.973
Can we crash here
and come home tomorrow?

19:04.543 --> 19:07.569
You want to spend the night?
I don't think so.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.376
They have great activities
for prospective freshmen.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.576
Involving beer kegs and bongs?

19:12.651 --> 19:16.610
No. God, Dad. I thought you'd
be happy. I can't apply for a year,

19:16.688 --> 19:18.815
and I'm psyched
about going to college.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.122
Well, where are you going to sleep?

19:22.194 --> 19:24.526
They have accommodations for us.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.497
Come on, Kyle's here.
It's guaranteed G-rated.

19:27.566 --> 19:28.999
We're all really into it.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.399
Just be careful
and keep your cell phone on.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.597
I will. And thank you.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.833
All right.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.341
If we told them the truth,
they'd flip out and make us come home.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.506
There's no way we can leave here now.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.347
- We just saw a picture of you in 1985.
- That wasn't me.

19:47.419 --> 19:50.115
- Then it's your long-lost twin.
- I'm not in my 40s.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.158
Look, Anna snagged us a room,
my parents are cool.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.455
Do you want to find out
who that man is or not?

19:55.527 --> 20:00.294
<i>Seeing that picture, I felt
I was getting close to the truth...</i>

20:00.365 --> 20:02.833
<i>...and it scared me.</i>

20:02.901 --> 20:04.232
Absolutely.

20:26.658 --> 20:27.818
What is that?

20:28.493 --> 20:30.552
Sorry, it's one of my patients.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.062
Was it Kyle?

20:32.898 --> 20:36.265
Whoa, that must be his alien voice.

20:36.368 --> 20:39.735
Sort of a mix
between human and dolphin.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.296
Out.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.534
It's like he's talking
at the wrong speed.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.133
Josh.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.054
<i>...seven, N.
One, two, two, one, eight, W.</i>

21:00.125 --> 21:02.685
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two, one, eight, W.</i>

21:02.794 --> 21:08.227
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two, one, eight, W.</i>

21:08.300 --> 21:10.359
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two...</i>

21:10.435 --> 21:12.596
How weird was that,
seeing that picture?

21:12.704 --> 21:15.264
Think about it,
you and that guy could be related.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.900
I haven't stopped thinking about it.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.343
If Josh were here, he'd have
some sort of time-traveler theory,

21:21.413 --> 21:23.973
with you jumping through
portals in space.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.511
Which you didn't. Did you?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.512
Sorry.

21:33.191 --> 21:35.318
There's this whole other world going on.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.830
There really is life after high school.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.957
I got coaches across the country
begging me to play for them.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.729
They don't have what U-Dub has.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.497
- What's that?
- Me.

21:45.570 --> 21:48.334
I take it back.
It is high school all over again.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.007
- Hey, Lori.
- Hey.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.971
You don't recognize me
without my Frisbee.

21:54.079 --> 21:57.014
No, I do. Wes, right?

21:57.082 --> 22:00.745
- How long will this trip of yours last?
- Just till tomorrow.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.582
We should make the most of it.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.418
Oh, I...
Kyle, do you want to look around?

22:05.524 --> 22:08.015
You go.
I'll see you later.

22:08.694 --> 22:09.854
You sure?

22:13.031 --> 22:18.196
- So do you want to see my room?
- Actually, I'm here with someone.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.761
Then why am I talking to you?

22:30.282 --> 22:33.183
<i>...eight, one, two, two, seven.
Seven, eight...</i>

22:33.251 --> 22:37.551
OK, that's the number Kyle pointed out
on the Ouija board. But the rest?

22:37.622 --> 22:40.648
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two, one, eight, W...</i>

22:40.726 --> 22:43.820
- The same pattern over and over again.
- Some sort of code.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.193
Well, I can't make any sense of it.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.391
Par for the course with Kyle.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.391
Play it back again.
I want to take it down.

22:51.470 --> 22:58.033
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two, one, eight, W.</i>

22:58.110 --> 23:00.408
<i>Four, seven, two, seven, N.
One, two, two...</i>

23:15.494 --> 23:17.587
Kyle, I've been looking for you.

23:17.662 --> 23:19.562
Are you OK?

23:20.298 --> 23:22.027
Just a lot to take in.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.728
New places are hard for me too.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.772
The problem is,
I don't know if it is a new place

23:27.873 --> 23:32.537
- or somewhere I've been before.
- I can't imagine.

23:33.111 --> 23:36.740
I'm sure when the time is right
everything will become clear to you.

23:40.452 --> 23:44.218
William would have been
so excited to meet you.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.718
You miss him.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.918
We were... good friends.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.791
I'm sorry about what happened.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.059
There is such brutality in this world.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.868
Still, you are an inspiration.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.707
You somehow achieved William's dream.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.804
To possess a mind
as fast as a computer.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.111
How does it make you feel?

24:13.251 --> 24:14.377
Different.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.820
But just think of all
that you can accomplish.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.990
By doing math problems?

24:22.060 --> 24:25.427
Solving equations and puzzles?

24:25.530 --> 24:29.261
- That's not important.
- What is?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.104
Knowing who I am.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.476
So, what do you want to study?

24:41.580 --> 24:45.209
- I haven't really thought about it.
- Well, what interests you?

24:45.283 --> 24:49.379
- I don't know. Art.
- Yeah, I can see that.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.184
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.623
I hate museums.
I don't get art at all.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.161
I just said it
to have something to say.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.060
I bet that you have a lot to say, Lori.

24:59.130 --> 25:02.361
You just haven't found
the right person to listen.

25:03.401 --> 25:06.336
- I know that sounded like a line...
- Totally.

25:06.404 --> 25:09.339
Well, I meant it, though.
Is it true?

25:23.722 --> 25:26.623
- Hey, you're still up.
- Hard to sleep.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.121
Miss your tub?

25:34.099 --> 25:37.660
- She's still out, huh?
- I thought she was with you.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.762
No, she was talking to that guy.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.603
If you like Lori,
why don't you tell her?

25:45.477 --> 25:47.604
She knows that I like her.

25:49.614 --> 25:53.380
Take your own advice. I haven't seen you
pour your heart out to Amanda.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.213
I picked up on it.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.314
But no worries,
I don't think she and Charlie have.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.484
Must kill you to see them together.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.858
I want her to be happy.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.363
I would be in there so fast.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.699
But Charlie's your friend.

26:09.768 --> 26:12.134
If you want someone,
you gotta give it a shot.

26:12.203 --> 26:15.172
If people are meant to be together,
they stay together.

26:40.532 --> 26:43.467
Oh, Kyle. I know it's early,
but I couldn't wait.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.503
- What happened?
- I found out his name.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.731
The guy in the photo.

26:47.839 --> 26:49.329
It's Adam Baylin.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.843
- Adam Baylin.
- Does it ring a bell?

26:56.448 --> 26:59.144
- No.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.613
Just need to grab a towel.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.957
Don't be discouraged. There's someone
I want you to meet who might help.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.896
She's a secretary in my department.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.434
Oh, those eyes.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.938
- Who could ever forget those eyes?
- He really looks like him?

27:21.006 --> 27:23.941
- Very much so.
- What was he like?

27:24.009 --> 27:26.170
Adam Baylin was brilliant.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.905
One of the finest graduate students
we ever had.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.847
And believe me,
I've been here forever, so I know.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.079
- Lily, tell them who he worked with.
- Professor Kern.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.114
William Kern was like a mentor to him.

27:38.189 --> 27:41.022
They were involved
in several projects together.

27:42.260 --> 27:46.629
But it's not just Adam's
academic achievements I remember.

27:46.698 --> 27:51.260
It's the way he took the time
to ask me about my life.

27:51.336 --> 27:55.796
He was that way with everyone.
His curiosity, his sensitivity.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.069
That's what I miss.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.839
So to see you here...

28:01.946 --> 28:04.676
Do you have an address
or a phone number?

28:04.749 --> 28:07.616
There are so many things
I'd like to ask him.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.154
Oh, sweetheart, didn't you know?

28:10.755 --> 28:13.622
You can't ask him anything.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.651
Adam Baylin has been missing
for 20 years.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.130
I can't believe they kept
all his research.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.039
He must have been exceptional.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.876
I don't think anyone's been
through these boxes in 20 years.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.006
Sounds about right.

28:39.084 --> 28:42.645
He was so involved in his work
then doesn't show up at school one day.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.485
Apparently,
he disappeared without a trace.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.720
Anything I can find out about
Adam Baylin is in these boxes.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.556
Take your time.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.697
Hey, I've been waiting for you.

29:03.441 --> 29:06.308
Great, you can grab the rest
from the car.

29:06.377 --> 29:09.608
No, listen, those letters
and numbers? I figured it out.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.616
They're coordinates.
Latitude and longitude.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.778
- What do you mean? Like a location?
- Near Seattle.

29:15.854 --> 29:18.186
Forty-seven degrees,
27 minutes north.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.020
Hundred and twenty-two degrees,
18 minutes west.

29:21.126 --> 29:25.085
I looked up the spot online,
on View-It Earth. But here's the thing:

29:25.163 --> 29:26.994
That location is blocked.

29:27.699 --> 29:30.862
- Blocked? Why?
- It's a top-secret government facility.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.130
- Josh!
- Like Area 51,

29:33.238 --> 29:37.004
where they hide all the aliens.
Kyle talked about it under hypnosis.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.635
- How much more proof do you need?
- Josh, you shouldn't be listening.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.442
If Kyle's the patient,
why talk to Dad about him?

29:43.515 --> 29:46.279
- I'm his foster father.
- And I'm his foster brother.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.511
If there's something going on with him,

29:48.586 --> 29:51.419
especially something
this cool and bizarre,

29:51.489 --> 29:53.582
I think I got a right to know about it.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.621
<i>Reading Adam Baylin's thoughts,
I felt a connection</i>

30:00.698 --> 30:02.791
<i>beyond our physical resemblance.</i>

30:02.867 --> 30:05.028
<i>I understood his research.</i>

30:05.103 --> 30:07.469
<i>It seemed that his mind
worked like my own.</i>

30:08.306 --> 30:10.467
<i>We had to be related.</i>

30:10.542 --> 30:11.804
<i>We had to be.</i>

30:16.581 --> 30:19.744
OK, what's with the attitude?

30:19.818 --> 30:22.343
It's like working with a hostile mute.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.183
I'm just concentrating.

30:25.890 --> 30:30.657
Yeah, I'm sure you're really fascinated
by all these equations and formulas.

30:32.530 --> 30:36.398
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Look, I know you're psyched,

30:36.467 --> 30:39.925
pretending you're in college and all,
but come on.

30:40.004 --> 30:43.132
You sleep with Frisbee Boy
after one night?

30:43.208 --> 30:47.838
OK, first off, it's none
of your business who I sleep with,

30:47.912 --> 30:50.608
and second, it's still
none of your business,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.775
but I did not have sex with Wes.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.820
- Right.
- God, Declan.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.913
We stayed up late talking
then I fell asleep in his room.

31:00.391 --> 31:04.555
Such a double standard. If I gave you
a hard time, you'd tell me to piss off.

31:04.629 --> 31:07.359
- I wouldn't say "piss off. "
- You know what I mean.

31:07.432 --> 31:11.368
We're friends, friends don't guilt
each other about who they hang out with.

31:11.436 --> 31:15.099
You're right. It's all good.

31:21.145 --> 31:22.874
So, what did you two talk about?

31:24.782 --> 31:28.741
It was less that he talked
and more that he listened.

31:38.329 --> 31:41.560
Kyle, I'm sorry,
I don't think there's anything here.

31:43.101 --> 31:44.966
Yes, there is.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.235
Adam Baylin drew it 20 years ago.

32:03.688 --> 32:07.215
<i>Hilary called. She was
surprised you were going to Whitman.</i>

32:07.292 --> 32:10.386
Declan had plans to go
to the University of Washington.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.758
Dad...

32:11.829 --> 32:13.729
<i>- What's going on?
- OK, look.</i>

32:13.798 --> 32:16.164
- We came up here to help Kyle.
- I don't care.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.963
<i>- You don't lie to us.
- I'm sorry.</i>

32:18.036 --> 32:21.597
We found out some things, like
this grad student who looks like Kyle.

32:21.673 --> 32:25.632
<i>- He's been missing since the '80s.
- What are you talking about?</i>

32:25.710 --> 32:29.202
The guy drew the symbol Kyle
kept drawing, with this code next to it.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.249
<i>Kyle figured out it's latitude
and longitude, like an address.</i>

32:32.350 --> 32:33.840
What are the coordinates?

32:36.421 --> 32:39.948
Forty-seven, 27 north,
122, 18 west.

32:40.024 --> 32:43.585
- It's a spot in the woods by here.
- How did you know that?

32:43.695 --> 32:47.324
You know Kyle. He's got a map
of the universe in his head.

32:47.398 --> 32:50.060
- We're gonna go check it out.
- No, you are not.

32:50.134 --> 32:53.001
You'll get back in that car
and drive home immediately.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.040
- We can't leave now.
- You will leave now. Do you hear me?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.506
<i>- I mean it.
- OK, calm down, we're going.</i>

32:58.576 --> 33:01.272
OK. Goodbye.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.305
Great.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.012
<i>They've been
playing detective.</i>

33:09.087 --> 33:11.055
<i>Why ask about the coordinates?</i>

33:11.122 --> 33:13.886
<i>Kyle figured out
it's in the woods near school.</i>

33:13.958 --> 33:15.687
<i>The spot that was blocked?</i>

33:15.760 --> 33:18.854
<i>They were planning to go,
but I told them to come home.</i>

33:18.930 --> 33:20.158
<i>They better be.</i>

33:21.366 --> 33:23.300
Hilary has such a big mouth.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.734
Oh, man. I forgot
I'd mentioned it to her.

33:26.471 --> 33:29.406
- Sorry, Kyle. We have to go home.
- We can't.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.872
My dad was pissed.
We'll come back another time.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.209
Fine.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.544
Bathroom break,
and then we're leaving.

33:43.988 --> 33:46.821
- Wait, where are you going?
- I have to get there.

33:46.891 --> 33:49.587
- You don't have a car.
- I'll find someone to drive me.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.993
- You can't do that.
- I can't turn back now. I'm too close.

33:53.064 --> 33:57.023
- OK, we'll convince Lori to go.
- No, I don't want her to come.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.532
It might be dangerous out there.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.203
Because that man Adam Baylin's
been missing?

34:02.273 --> 34:03.831
Yeah.

34:06.711 --> 34:10.408
We'll call, tell her what we're doing,
then come back and pick her up.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.789
- It's right here.
- Here?

34:33.871 --> 34:35.429
It's Lori again.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.366
OK, OK, stop yelling.

34:38.443 --> 34:42.004
I cannot believe you did this to me.
Do you know how much trouble I'm in?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.844
We're at the spot.
I'll call you later.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.043
Don't hang up on me. Don't!

34:51.322 --> 34:52.447
Sure this is it?

34:54.559 --> 34:55.719
Yes.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.787
All we need is a Tin Man
and the Cowardly Lion.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.627
Never mind.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.326
- Stay here.
- No way.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.326
- I'm going alone.
- Like hell.

35:07.171 --> 35:08.638
Declan.

35:08.706 --> 35:11.470
Thanks for driving me,
but I have to do this on my own.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.939
I'll be fine.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.509
Stop!

36:42.967 --> 36:44.628
- What do you want?
- Shut up.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.330
- Why are you following me?
- Shut up and listen to me.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.200
I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:51.442 --> 36:53.603
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

36:53.711 --> 36:57.272
- Like you killed Professor Kern?
- He's not who you thought. Trust me.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.746
Trust you?

36:58.816 --> 37:01.717
- Everything I did was to protect you.
- No.

37:02.587 --> 37:06.045
- To keep you safe.
- Safe from what?

37:06.791 --> 37:08.622
You gotta trust me.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.253
You gotta stop asking questions.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.490
Forget about the past.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.464
Get on with your life.

37:16.834 --> 37:21.203
Because if you don't, you're gonna put
yourself and you're going to put Nicole,

37:21.272 --> 37:24.105
Stephen, Lori and Josh,
that whole family, in danger.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.439
What are you talking about?

37:27.211 --> 37:28.542
They'll kill you, Kyle.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.546
- They'll kill all of you.
- Kyle!

37:35.386 --> 37:37.616
- Now get out of here.
- Kyle!

37:37.688 --> 37:39.451
And remember what I told you.

37:41.626 --> 37:44.595
Go! And don't ever come back.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.521
Go!

37:52.436 --> 37:54.301
Man, what is he doing?

37:59.577 --> 38:01.204
Kyle!

38:05.416 --> 38:08.351
- Let's go.
- What happened? What did you see?

38:08.419 --> 38:10.785
- Nothing.
- Kyle, you saw something.

38:10.855 --> 38:13.016
There was nothing there.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.600
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I thought it was important for Kyle.

38:23.701 --> 38:27.762
- I told you to come straight home.
- That was my fault, Mr. Trager.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.032
Please don't be mad at Lori and Declan.

38:31.776 --> 38:32.936
They did it for me.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.579
Kyle, that student who resembles you,

38:35.680 --> 38:39.343
Lori said he's been missing
for 20 years, and that he drew the logo.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.442
There's no point in pursuing it now.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.047
What difference
does it make to my life now?

38:46.157 --> 38:50.787
If that's the case, why is that spot
blocked on View-It Earth?

38:50.861 --> 38:54.888
No reason it should be.
It's just a bunch of trees.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.645
Something happened
out there in the woods.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.474
No.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.850
I know you're in trouble, Kyle.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.652
I'm gonna tell Lori's parents.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.558
No, you can't do that!

39:25.596 --> 39:27.461
Then talk to me.

39:33.337 --> 39:37.797
That man, Tom Foss, the security guard,
he was out there in the woods.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.537
He warned me to stop asking questions
about my past.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.169
Why?

39:42.279 --> 39:44.713
Something bad
could happen to the Tragers.

39:44.782 --> 39:47.342
So we can't tell anyone or do anything.

39:48.919 --> 39:51.979
Just move on and forget all about it.
Understand?

39:53.991 --> 39:55.891
Can I trust you?

39:56.994 --> 39:58.962
Yes.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.423
What, no goodbye?

40:02.500 --> 40:04.525
You're not mad anymore?

40:04.602 --> 40:06.297
I'm over it.

40:10.641 --> 40:14.372
- Thanks for taking me, Lori.
- Told you you'd thank me.

40:16.514 --> 40:17.981
Later, bro.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.640
Later.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.716
If you dare say, "Later, Trager... "

40:26.791 --> 40:29.225
I wasn't going to say anything.

41:07.898 --> 41:11.800
<i>All this time, I'd been trying
to restore my memory.</i>

41:13.204 --> 41:17.971
<i>But I didn't realize that sometimes
memories are better left forgotten.</i>

41:19.410 --> 41:21.970
<i>I wanted to know who I was.</i>

41:22.046 --> 41:26.312
<i>But maybe some mysteries
are better left unsolved.</i>

41:49.540 --> 41:51.405
From three hours ago.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.753
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.250
He's alive.
