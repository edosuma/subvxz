00:55.139 --> 00:57.725
<i>Obviously,
I miscalculated a few things.</i>

01:04.566 --> 01:08.736
Eddie! I know you're in there!

01:14.492 --> 01:17.954
<i>Why is it that the moment your life
exceeds your wildest dreams...</i>

01:18.037 --> 01:19.581
<i>The access code you have entered...</i>

01:19.664 --> 01:21.958
<i>...the knife appears at your back?</i>

01:22.041 --> 01:25.336
<i>The access code
you have entered is invalid...</i>

01:25.420 --> 01:28.840
<i>Well, I'll tell you one thing...</i>

01:51.029 --> 01:53.448
<i>...I will never let them touch me.</i>

02:06.461 --> 02:09.172
<i>My neighbor, who must have
opened his door to complain.</i>

02:09.255 --> 02:12.759
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!

02:14.677 --> 02:18.598
<i>For a guy with a four digit IQ,
I must have missed something.</i>

02:18.681 --> 02:20.558
<i>And I hadn't missed much.</i>

02:21.976 --> 02:24.520
<i>I'd come this close to having
an impact on the world.</i>

02:25.897 --> 02:28.441
<i>And now, the only thing
I'd have an impact on...</i>

02:29.609 --> 02:31.235
<i>...was the sidewalk.</i>

03:53.192 --> 03:54.902
<i>You see that guy?</i>

03:54.986 --> 03:56.988
<i>That was me, not so long ago.</i>

03:57.905 --> 04:00.992
<i>What kind of guy without a drug or
alcohol problem looks this way?</i>

04:01.701 --> 04:03.786
<i>Only a writer. Strangely enough,</i>

04:03.870 --> 04:06.539
<i>nobody believed that
I actually had a book contract.</i>

04:06.622 --> 04:08.332
Well, it's masquerading
as a sci-fi novel,

04:08.416 --> 04:10.084
but it's really, uh,
my own personal manifesto

04:10.168 --> 04:12.086
about the plight of the
individual in the 21st century.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.422
I sort of created a utopian society

04:14.505 --> 04:16.716
where we all sort of...
Uh... Uh...

04:16.798 --> 04:19.510
It's really... it's really...

04:23.306 --> 04:24.265
Uh...

04:26.642 --> 04:29.771
<i>Today was the day
I was gonna kick its ass.</i>

04:29.854 --> 04:32.857
<i>Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go...</i>

04:34.317 --> 04:36.027
<i>It was gonna be great.</i>

04:36.569 --> 04:39.322
<i>Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.</i>

04:40.823 --> 04:42.116
<i>That's the key concept.</i>

04:43.367 --> 04:45.661
<i>Don't leave the room.</i>

04:53.127 --> 04:55.713
<i>A few weeks passed this way.</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:57.131
<i>Maybe a few months.</i>

05:03.095 --> 05:04.263
<i>At least I still had Lindy.</i>

05:07.558 --> 05:09.101
Just like that?

05:10.228 --> 05:14.565
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.068
I'm surprised.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.321
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...

05:20.404 --> 05:22.114
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.658
If you just wait to see
what she says...

05:23.741 --> 05:24.951
Eddie.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.245
- What?
- I know how it's going.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.080
I'm your...

05:29.914 --> 05:32.124
I was your girlfriend.

05:33.251 --> 05:35.628
That word doesn't even begin
to describe what you are to me.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.090
Partner? Squeeze?

05:39.173 --> 05:42.051
Paramour. Inamorata.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.346
Cleaning lady. Bank.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.268
Be that a...

05:51.310 --> 05:52.645
What's mine is yours, too,

05:52.728 --> 05:55.147
and you know I want to share
the rest of my life with you.

05:55.231 --> 05:57.400
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.318
Why not?

06:00.361 --> 06:03.447
Because it worked out
so well for you last time.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.659
<i>It's true, I did marry once.
Right out of college, to Melissa.</i>

06:06.742 --> 06:08.327
I do.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.412
<i>Briefly.</i>

06:09.495 --> 06:11.289
- This isn't working.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.629
Well, even though everything you
say is true, I still love you.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.512
I gotta get back to work.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.725
You didn't even
tell me what happened.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.144
- I got it.
- You did?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.521
Mmm-hm. I'm an editor.

06:35.605 --> 06:38.024
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?

06:38.858 --> 06:40.735
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.280
Thanks.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.784
- OK.
- OK.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.461
<i>She was right. Why stick it out?</i>

06:59.295 --> 07:01.422
<i>I had clearly missed the on-ramp.</i>

07:02.089 --> 07:03.883
<i>We both knew what was beckoning.</i>

07:03.966 --> 07:07.219
<i>The lower bunk in my
childhood bedroom in Jersey.</i>

07:07.303 --> 07:09.889
<i>My father happy to we/come me
into the challenging field</i>

07:09.972 --> 07:12.058
<i>of dental supply inventory.</i>

07:12.683 --> 07:13.893
Eddie Morra.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.230
<i>Of all the useless
relationships better forgotten</i>

07:18.314 --> 07:19.857
<i>and put away in mothballs,</i>

07:19.940 --> 07:22.902
<i>is there any more useless than...
the ex-brother-in-law?</i>

07:22.985 --> 07:25.237
Holy shit, man.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.239
What has it been? Like nine years?

07:27.323 --> 07:28.574
- God!
- Hey.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.244
You all right? You look like
you're living on the streets.

07:32.328 --> 07:33.329
What's going on?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.540
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.709
Uh, I'm writing. Writing a lot.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.419
Oh, you're still trying to write?

07:41.212 --> 07:42.713
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.590
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.175
- That's great.
- How about you?

07:46.258 --> 07:47.677
Are you still dealing, Vern?

07:47.760 --> 07:51.055
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.391
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.394
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.939
- When has that ever stopped you?

08:02.233 --> 08:04.777
- So.
- So...

08:04.860 --> 08:06.487
How's Melissa doing?

08:06.570 --> 08:08.239
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

08:08.322 --> 08:12.451
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.

08:12.535 --> 08:17.123
She got some kind of Internet home sales
kind of job. Couple kids.

08:17.206 --> 08:20.167
Couple kids. Who's the husband?

08:21.168 --> 08:24.755
He walked out on her,
if you really want to know.

08:24.839 --> 08:26.257
But what do you care, man?

08:27.049 --> 08:29.510
You were married, like, five minutes.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.513
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?

08:32.596 --> 08:35.390
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?

08:36.892 --> 08:38.644
Well, it's, uh...

08:38.727 --> 08:40.104
I'm... I'm...

08:41.230 --> 08:43.023
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.

08:43.107 --> 08:47.361
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days
and nights, if you really want to know.

08:47.445 --> 08:50.906
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.410
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.291
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.084
Just this once.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.712
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:04.795 --> 09:08.299
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.968
Brother,
I am light years from that now.

09:11.051 --> 09:15.181
I've been doing, uh, some consulting
for a pharmaceutical company.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.017
What, like some offshore lab
making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.

09:18.100 --> 09:22.938
No. This is an exclusive product
that's coming on stream next year.

09:23.022 --> 09:25.900
They've had clinical trials
and it's FDA approved.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.903
All right, just out of curiosity
and that's all...

09:30.821 --> 09:32.239
Let's see it.

09:35.326 --> 09:36.368
What's in it?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.288
They've identified these receptors
in the brain

09:39.371 --> 09:42.166
that activate specific circuits.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.920
And you how they say that we can
only access 20 percent of our brain?

09:46.587 --> 09:51.091
Well, what this does...
it lets you access all of it.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.721
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.

09:55.805 --> 09:58.349
I don't think that my life's
gonna take some sudden upswing

09:58.432 --> 10:01.685
into fame and fortune by taking some shiny,
brand-new designer drug.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.855
Gant. When?

10:04.939 --> 10:08.984
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.029
No, now.

10:13.405 --> 10:17.243
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to leave you here, Eddie.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.995
But I really... I really do
want to do this again.

10:20.079 --> 10:23.374
So, call me.
And, uh, that's on the house.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.668
I don't want it.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.963
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?

10:29.046 --> 10:31.674
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.

10:32.967 --> 10:33.926
You're welcome.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.523
<i>All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.</i>

10:48.274 --> 10:50.943
<i>How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.</i>

10:51.819 --> 10:54.905
<i>- Smarter than anyone around her.</i>

10:54.989 --> 10:57.366
<i>Clearly, there was a direct link
between this Eddie,</i>

10:57.449 --> 11:00.536
<i>slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon,
and an earlier Eddie...</i>

11:01.704 --> 11:04.665
<i>...vomiting on his boss's desk
or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.</i>

11:06.375 --> 11:09.420
<i>So who could blame Lindy
for dumping me?</i>

11:18.304 --> 11:21.390
<i>In the end, how much worse could it get?</i>

11:29.773 --> 11:31.775
<i>I didn't want to see anybody.</i>

11:31.859 --> 11:34.695
<i>Especially not my landlord's
nasty young wife.</i>

11:34.778 --> 11:37.114
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.491
Steve handles the rent,
so you can feed your crap to him.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.493
<i>I suddenly had extra reason
to get away from her.</i>

11:41.577 --> 11:44.371
<i>I had thoughtlessly ingested
a substance.</i>

11:44.455 --> 11:45.831
Like the rent's not low enough!

11:45.915 --> 11:48.584
<i>I had gotten remarkably
little information from Vernon</i>

11:48.667 --> 11:50.377
<i>about what this drug would do.</i>

11:50.461 --> 11:54.048
You could even be a bike messenger
and come up with that. Really.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.425
<i>- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic.</i>

11:56.508 --> 11:58.886
<i>Oh, my God.
Listening to her rag...</i>

11:58.969 --> 12:00.638
<i>If I were tripping,
I'd jump out a fucking window.</i>

12:00.721 --> 12:02.890
Hello? Are you listening to me?

12:02.973 --> 12:05.976
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!

12:06.060 --> 12:07.811
<i>And then, I felt it.</i>

12:38.884 --> 12:41.095
<i>I was blind, but now I see.</i>

12:56.110 --> 12:58.654
...running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?

12:58.737 --> 13:00.948
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!

13:01.031 --> 13:04.410
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!

13:15.754 --> 13:17.881
- What's wrong?
- What?

13:17.965 --> 13:20.426
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating,

13:20.509 --> 13:23.220
energy-sucking piece of shit
who's sponging off your husband.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.638
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out,

13:24.722 --> 13:27.641
but my existence shouldn't make you
this upset. What is it?

13:28.642 --> 13:31.353
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?

13:31.437 --> 13:32.813
How do you know I'm in law school?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.523
People who aren't, usually
don't carry around dry,

13:34.606 --> 13:37.151
academically-constipated books
about a dead Supreme Court justice.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.195
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... You've been following me.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.323
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.783
How did you know that?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.953
<i>I'd seen it before.
Twelve years ago in college.</i>

13:48.037 --> 13:50.289
<i>Sitting on the couch of a TA
I was trying to make,</i>

13:50.372 --> 13:52.124
<i>waiting for her to come
back out of the bathroom,</i>

13:52.207 --> 13:54.168
<i>hoping she'd have a condom.</i>

13:54.251 --> 13:56.795
<i>Somehow my unconscious
had served that up.</i>

13:56.879 --> 13:58.422
<i>A memory I had never even recorded.</i>

13:58.505 --> 14:02.217
<i>Or was it there the whole time
and all I needed was the access?</i>

14:02.301 --> 14:04.428
If you're writing a paper,
that's not the book I'd use.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.305
Well, who asked you?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.307
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.476
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

14:10.559 --> 14:11.894
which sort of gives credence
to the theory

14:11.977 --> 14:12.978
that one of the clerks he had fired

14:13.062 --> 14:15.189
actually wrote most of
this guy's major opinions.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.608
You could Google the clerk's sons,
they'd love to talk to you.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.360
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you
something that no one else has...

14:20.444 --> 14:23.197
<i>Information from the odd
museum show, a half-read article,</i>

14:23.280 --> 14:26.325
<i>some PBS documentary... it was all
bubbling up in my frontal lobes,</i>

14:26.408 --> 14:29.828
<i>mixing itself together into a sparkling
cocktail of useful information.</i>

14:31.914 --> 14:34.750
<i>- She didn't have a chance.</i>
- So, what are your suggestions?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.840
<i>We'd really worked
on her paper, too.</i>

14:42.633 --> 14:46.261
<i>In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.</i>

14:52.476 --> 14:56.271
<i>Home. But it couldn't be my home,
could it?</i>

14:57.105 --> 14:58.565
<i>Who would live like this?</i>

15:00.192 --> 15:02.611
<i>Torch it.</i>

15:03.821 --> 15:05.447
<i>But saner heads prevailed.</i>

15:40.899 --> 15:43.235
<i>What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it,</i>

15:43.318 --> 15:48.156
<i>I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours,
hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?</i>

15:48.240 --> 15:51.702
<i>What was this? A drug for people who
wanted to be more anal retentive?</i>

15:51.785 --> 15:54.580
<i>I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.</i>

15:54.663 --> 15:57.165
<i>I knew what I needed to do
and how to do it.</i>

16:34.953 --> 16:40.375
<i>The next morning, I sent
a little probe down into my brain.</i>

16:40.459 --> 16:44.046
<i>No surge of brilliance
came up to greet me.</i>

16:47.424 --> 16:50.677
<i>In short... I was back.</i>

16:55.349 --> 16:57.267
<i>But, something remained.</i>

17:01.396 --> 17:02.397
You're kidding.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.484
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.529
- Yes.
- Written by you.

17:09.613 --> 17:10.989
All you have to do is read three pages.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.159
Just read three pages
in the next hour and...

17:14.242 --> 17:16.787
...if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.916
OK.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.503
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.449
<i>Eddie,
give me a call when you get in.</i>

17:56.535 --> 18:01.164
<i>Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
Call me.</i>

18:01.248 --> 18:04.376
<i>It's a little grandiose,
but I'm still reading.</i>

18:04.459 --> 18:08.213
<i>OK, how did you do this?</i>

18:08.296 --> 18:13.468
<i>I'd really like... Just call me
the minute you get in. Call. OK?</i>

18:29.484 --> 18:32.738
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.325
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.747
It's not a good time, Eddie.

18:41.830 --> 18:45.000
Uh, hey, Vern, I really
just need to talk to you.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.170
Hey... Oh...

18:51.214 --> 18:54.843
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.805
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.

18:58.889 --> 19:02.476
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.187
Vern, who did this to you?

19:05.729 --> 19:07.189
Trust me, you don't want to know.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.610
Uh...

19:11.693 --> 19:15.739
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.618
But the boys in the kitchen
are calling it NZT 48.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.913
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...

19:22.996 --> 19:26.374
That doesn't sound
very FDA-approved, Vern.

19:26.458 --> 19:31.129
FDA-approved, that's a laugh. You didn't
really believe that shit, did ya?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.132
<i>OK, so what do we have here?</i>

19:34.216 --> 19:37.385
<i>Some unknown, untested,
possibly dangerous drug</i>

19:37.469 --> 19:39.805
<i>scammed out of some
unidentified lab somewhere</i>

19:39.888 --> 19:44.267
<i>given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years.</i>

19:44.351 --> 19:47.229
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.

19:49.231 --> 19:53.151
All right, we'll talk about it,
but I, uh, need a favor first.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.446
Obviously, I'm in no condition
to go out right now, so,

19:56.530 --> 20:02.160
I was wondering if you could pop down to
the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.

20:02.244 --> 20:06.623
And maybe grab a little...
a little breakfast for us.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.876
<i>He knew he had me.</i>

20:10.627 --> 20:11.628
Sure.

20:12.796 --> 20:16.550
<i>From now on,
I'd happily be his errand boy.</i>

20:16.633 --> 20:19.928
<i>Wash his windows,
scrub his toilet...</i>

20:20.011 --> 20:22.764
<i>...anything I could do to get my hands
on that little clear pill</i>

20:22.848 --> 20:25.934
<i>that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.</i>

20:37.404 --> 20:38.947
Vern?

20:49.082 --> 20:50.834
Vern?

21:13.481 --> 21:14.900
Vern...

21:17.527 --> 21:19.654
on, Vern.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.095
Hey, hey!

21:44.804 --> 21:46.306
Hey!

21:57.817 --> 22:02.280
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Hi, I need to report a...

22:02.364 --> 22:03.823
...a murder.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.745
7B, yes.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.041
OK, I won't.

22:15.543 --> 22:20.131
<i>Took them forever. And the longer
I stood there, the clearer I saw.</i>

22:20.215 --> 22:22.342
<i>Vern had known whoever had done this.</i>

22:23.593 --> 22:26.263
<i>And one guess what
they'd been looking for.</i>

22:30.850 --> 22:32.602
<i>But had they found it?</i>

23:12.017 --> 23:15.145
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.474
Police Department!
Open the door, please!

23:55.018 --> 23:57.896
Police Department! Open the door!

24:01.983 --> 24:06.363
Open the door, please!

24:07.781 --> 24:09.908
Police! Open the door!

24:09.991 --> 24:12.911
Let's go! Open the door!

24:12.994 --> 24:14.287
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.331
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!

24:16.414 --> 24:17.832
I called you guys!

24:20.960 --> 24:23.755
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?

24:23.838 --> 24:27.634
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just
actually ran into him on the street

24:27.717 --> 24:30.261
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?

24:30.345 --> 24:34.224
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?

24:34.307 --> 24:37.602
He... Uh, I don't know. He was, um...

24:37.685 --> 24:40.105
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?

24:40.188 --> 24:44.025
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques. Um...

24:44.109 --> 24:47.195
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...

24:48.113 --> 24:49.989
- ...chairs and stuff.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.784
Like, you know,
like curlicue leg things.

24:52.867 --> 24:53.952
Yeah?

24:55.036 --> 24:57.997
That is correct. An Edward Morra.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.416
He's here.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.043
Victim's sister.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.630
<i>I hadn't heard her voice
in ten years.</i>

25:06.381 --> 25:09.092
<i>- Eddie?</i>
- Melissa?

25:09.801 --> 25:12.720
<i>- You were there?</i>
- Um...

25:12.804 --> 25:17.892
Just before. I had run into him
on the street and, uh... yeah.

25:17.976 --> 25:23.189
<i>Oh, God. I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff.</i>

25:24.023 --> 25:25.483
<i>I'd better not say any more.</i>

25:25.567 --> 25:28.736
No, no, that's probably a good idea.

25:28.820 --> 25:33.366
So, uh... We should probably, uh,
meet or something, right?

25:33.450 --> 25:38.163
<i>No, I gotta do the funeral
and God knows what else. I just...</i>

25:38.246 --> 25:40.457
<i>We can't meet, OK?</i>

25:40.540 --> 25:42.876
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll
just see you at the funeral then.

25:42.959 --> 25:46.296
<i>No. I don't want that. Please
don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?</i>

25:46.379 --> 25:49.382
<i>- When this is over.</i>
- OK, all right.

25:49.466 --> 25:50.675
<i>OK.</i>

25:55.305 --> 25:59.851
You know, something doesn't gel here.

25:59.934 --> 26:03.563
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.473
<i>Worth the risk?</i>

26:43.811 --> 26:45.730
<i>What would you do?</i>

27:15.843 --> 27:20.014
<i>Vern's cash, combined with
an unprecedented surge of motivation,</i>

27:20.098 --> 27:22.892
<i>enabled me to finish the book
in four days.</i>

27:33.486 --> 27:34.946
<i>A tablet a day</i>

27:35.029 --> 27:37.448
<i>and what I could do
with my day was limitless.</i>

27:38.616 --> 27:40.910
<i>I learned to play
the piano in three days.</i>

27:43.246 --> 27:44.789
<i>Math became useful.</i>

27:45.707 --> 27:46.791
<i>And fun.</i>

27:46.874 --> 27:48.459
I'm all in.

27:52.755 --> 27:55.717
<i>Even half-listening
to any language, I became fluent.</i>

28:03.266 --> 28:05.768
So that Shakespeare's catchiness
belies mediocrity?

28:06.603 --> 28:07.604
There's no arguing with you.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.233
<i>This was great.</i>

28:12.317 --> 28:15.028
So, Mom, I've been doing a little
research on Aunt Helen's tumor.

28:15.111 --> 28:18.698
And it's totally clear that anybody with
familial adenomatous polyposis

28:18.781 --> 28:20.992
should be supplementing
platinum-based doublet regiments

28:21.075 --> 28:22.452
with eicosapentaeonic acid.

28:22.535 --> 28:25.079
<i>I suddenly knew everything.
About everything.</i>

28:25.163 --> 28:27.665
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

28:27.749 --> 28:29.500
devalue the stock completely
in two years?

28:29.584 --> 28:32.086
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?

28:32.170 --> 28:34.505
There aren't. Because there are
no safeguards in human nature.

28:34.589 --> 28:36.090
We're wired to overreach.

28:36.174 --> 28:38.384
Look at history, all the countries
that ever ruled the world.

28:38.468 --> 28:39.969
Portugal with this big massive navy.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.846
All they got now are salt cod
and cheap condoms.

28:41.929 --> 28:42.889
- And the Brits?

28:42.972 --> 28:45.058
Now they're just sitting on a dank
little island fussing over their suits.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.809
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well."

28:46.893 --> 28:49.312
We got France, we got Poland,
we got a big Swiss bank account.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.064
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.941
"Let's go home, let's pop a beer,
and let's live off the interest."

28:54.025 --> 28:55.443
- Yeah.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.904
<i>My brain was just
pouring this stuff out.</i>

28:57.987 --> 29:01.658
<i>Everything I had ever read, heard,
seen was now organized and available.</i>

29:01.741 --> 29:03.242
<i>Here it is. Here you go.</i>

29:03.868 --> 29:06.663
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio,

29:06.746 --> 29:09.957
but if you don't, I'd be very
interested in working with you.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.418
OK, Kevin.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.713
<i>I made some new friends
who invited me to the beach.</i>

29:15.797 --> 29:18.132
<i>The beach was not nearby.</i>

29:30.520 --> 29:33.189
<i>All my fear,
all my shyness, gone.</i>

29:33.272 --> 29:35.149
They've done four basic trials...

29:36.109 --> 29:38.653
<i>But mere lounging wasn't enough.</i>

30:03.845 --> 30:06.848
<i>Only problem?
If I wasn't moving forward,</i>

30:06.931 --> 30:09.183
<i>I felt like I was going to explode.</i>

30:09.267 --> 30:11.394
Come up here because
it's beautiful, right?

30:11.477 --> 30:14.355
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?

30:18.818 --> 30:20.778
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

30:22.822 --> 30:23.865
Oh, my God!

30:36.043 --> 30:37.545
Oh!

30:39.255 --> 30:40.423
Ah!

30:40.506 --> 30:44.552
<i>And then I began to form an idea.</i>

30:44.635 --> 30:47.054
<i>Suddenly, I knew exactly
what I needed to do.</i>

30:47.138 --> 30:49.724
<i>It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.</i>

30:49.807 --> 30:51.851
<i>It was much bigger than that.</i>

30:54.604 --> 30:56.481
<i>But it would take money to get there.</i>

30:59.442 --> 31:02.028
<i>In a down market,
no one was making much.</i>

31:03.196 --> 31:05.531
<i>But no one had NZT.</i>

31:05.615 --> 31:08.743
<i>In an optimistic scenario,
gains of that nature merely would reflect</i>

31:08.826 --> 31:11.704
<i>growth in the economy
and would not pose an obstacle...</i>

31:18.294 --> 31:23.549
<i>Armed with Vern's last $800
I made 2,000 in a day.</i>

31:23.633 --> 31:25.968
<i>Next day, 7, 500.</i>

31:26.052 --> 31:29.430
<i>It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.</i>

31:30.181 --> 31:32.475
<i>But banks weren't lending
to guys like me.</i>

31:32.558 --> 31:33.518
Hey, Liev.

31:33.601 --> 31:36.103
That's your man
in the corner back there.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.442
Yeah.

31:49.617 --> 31:54.288
So, uh, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?

31:54.372 --> 31:56.290
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.

31:56.832 --> 31:57.833
Why?

31:57.917 --> 32:02.004
Because I don't see you before
and I don't fucking like you already.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.049
Why do I give you $100,000?

32:05.341 --> 32:06.676
Because...

32:08.553 --> 32:12.265
...I quintupled my money
four days in a row.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.267
So you got a fix on the game.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.102
No, not a fix.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.604
I was able to calculate certain patterns
using algorithms.

32:18.688 --> 32:21.107
If you look at column four,
this was the first...

32:23.526 --> 32:26.529
You're good.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.324
OK, it's a fix.

32:30.408 --> 32:33.286
Yeah, you know,
all you people get caught.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.662
What are you gonna do then?

32:35.496 --> 32:37.957
Well, it's not as if I have
a black book with your name in it,

32:38.040 --> 32:39.792
if that's what you're talking about.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.128
And besides, I get the strong feeling

32:42.211 --> 32:45.089
that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.721
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.139
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.352
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.

32:58.436 --> 33:02.064
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?

33:02.148 --> 33:04.191
I cut you at waist.

33:04.275 --> 33:08.029
Peel your skin up over your head
and tie knot in it.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.531
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.

33:10.615 --> 33:12.950
- OK.
- Good luck.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.711
<i>My new friend, Kevin Doyle,
showed me how you could leverage</i>

33:23.794 --> 33:27.715
<i>two and a half times your cash
at the day trading firm.</i>

33:27.798 --> 33:29.634
<i>I'd been upping the dose
for over a week.</i>

33:31.927 --> 33:34.513
<i>It seemed to cut my /earning curve.</i>

33:48.986 --> 33:51.781
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.700
But not for the big fat defense contract
he bribed his way into.

33:54.784 --> 33:57.203
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.

33:57.286 --> 34:00.164
<i>I was jacked in. Booted up.</i>

34:00.247 --> 34:02.041
<i>At the end of the week,
my brokerage account</i>

34:02.124 --> 34:04.168
<i>contained over two million dollars.</i>

34:05.169 --> 34:07.088
<i>Word quickly got out.</i>

34:12.967 --> 34:15.929
<i>You have 19 messages.</i>

34:16.013 --> 34:18.516
<i>Four job offers,
my bank raising my line of credit,</i>

34:18.599 --> 34:20.266
<i>a reporter from the New York Post.</i>

34:20.351 --> 34:22.268
<i>Really call me back, Mr. Morra.</i>

34:22.353 --> 34:23.771
<i>No one makes money that fast.</i>

34:23.853 --> 34:26.315
<i>This article's gonna get written
with or without you.</i>

34:26.399 --> 34:29.527
<i>And finally,
Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.</i>

34:29.610 --> 34:34.031
<i>Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss
and, well, the impossible happened, bud.</i>

34:34.114 --> 34:36.951
<i>We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.</i>

34:37.034 --> 34:39.495
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

34:39.578 --> 34:43.248
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.960
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

35:06.313 --> 35:07.898
Since when do you speak Italian?

35:08.524 --> 35:11.485
Oh.
Self-improvement month.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.696
I guess somebody
gave me a wake up call.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.948
I hope you didn't do it for me.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.159
No, I just wanted
to apologize to you, Lin.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.955
And let you know that apparently
my capacity for self-sabotage

35:23.038 --> 35:25.040
wasn't boundless after all.

35:26.751 --> 35:29.086
The real question is,
why did you ever put up with me?

35:30.504 --> 35:32.173
I was in love with you.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.473
So, when does the book come out?

35:40.556 --> 35:42.433
Next year.
How's your new assistant?

35:42.516 --> 35:44.185
- She's good.
- Good.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.604
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:49.106 --> 35:51.108
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...

35:51.192 --> 35:54.320
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.

35:57.406 --> 36:01.452
I'm proud of you. And...

36:07.416 --> 36:09.168
...a little intimidated.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.797
<i>We started up again.</i>

36:16.091 --> 36:17.384
<i>Her place.</i>

36:21.430 --> 36:22.598
<i>My place.</i>

36:25.184 --> 36:26.644
<i>Basically every place.</i>

36:30.356 --> 36:32.525
"In a sizzling
three days of trading,"

36:32.608 --> 36:35.402
"the unknown Mr. Morra
trumped the market,"

36:35.486 --> 36:38.364
"prompting one top, hedge
fund manager to comment""

36:38.447 --> 36:41.408
"He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."'

36:41.492 --> 36:42.827
OK, give me that.
Give me that!

36:42.910 --> 36:45.120
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?

36:45.704 --> 36:48.040
I can't. I don't have a key.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.375
Oh, that's right.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.504
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.422
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?

36:55.506 --> 36:57.341
Can it be a new key?

36:58.467 --> 37:00.219
To our place?

37:01.971 --> 37:05.891
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.196
Can I walk you to work?

37:36.505 --> 37:38.257
Whatcha doing, hon?

37:39.133 --> 37:40.801
Nothing.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.804
You should sleep.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.517
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?

38:03.449 --> 38:05.993
Eddie?

38:06.076 --> 38:07.912
Are you OK?

38:10.164 --> 38:12.291
What are you doing out here?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.923
When's the last time you ate something?

38:26.472 --> 38:30.267
There he is.
Nice article in the Post, buddy.

38:32.269 --> 38:34.939
OK, he is on his way.

38:35.648 --> 38:38.317
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.

38:38.734 --> 38:41.737
One minute, your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.950
And he needs direct answers. Anything
tentative and you've lost him forever.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.703
I think we should rehearse
a few scenarios.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.538
I'm eating, Kevin.

38:52.081 --> 38:53.749
Hey, are you up for this?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.002
You sure? 'Cause I got
a little bit on the line here.

38:57.086 --> 38:59.171
Have a toast point.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.717
- It's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.

39:03.801 --> 39:04.802
He's worth a fortune.

39:04.885 --> 39:08.055
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.723
- How are ya?
- Eddie.

39:16.814 --> 39:19.233
So, Eddie Morra.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.361
- What's your secret?
- Medication.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.154
I'm on special medication.

39:24.697 --> 39:26.198
OK.

39:28.993 --> 39:30.744
Well, it's a formula
with a complex method.

39:30.828 --> 39:33.247
But, of course, research was
a component. Massive research.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.375
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA
in every company I bought.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.086
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office, and you know what?

39:39.169 --> 39:41.296
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.550
Sure, the stocks rose,
but who wants to do all that work

39:44.633 --> 39:46.176
for a shitty little uptake?

39:46.260 --> 39:49.430
It's not the visceral kind of spike
you want in short term holdings so...

39:49.513 --> 39:51.181
...I dispensed
with all the hard statistics

39:51.265 --> 39:52.558
and I went right to the rumor mill.

39:52.641 --> 39:55.769
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

39:55.853 --> 39:59.356
Sure. Share prices aren't really
based on how a company works.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.941
It's about how mass psychology works.

40:01.025 --> 40:03.235
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

40:03.318 --> 40:05.612
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.

40:05.696 --> 40:07.990
Well, not everybody
understands the patterns.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.784
And that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.453
So then, I went on
to door number three.

40:12.536 --> 40:15.873
Are you really implying that you have
some sort of ultimate formula?

40:15.956 --> 40:19.209
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.

40:19.293 --> 40:22.755
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.

40:22.838 --> 40:27.051
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

40:30.012 --> 40:33.140
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what
you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.600
You don't work in my world.

40:34.683 --> 40:38.103
I'm up to my ass with investment guys
and you don't have their half-terrified,

40:38.187 --> 40:40.230
half-cocky line of crap which is...

40:40.314 --> 40:43.025
...not to say that
I like yours any better.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.070
But you obviously pick your stocks
in a way which I haven't seen before.

40:46.153 --> 40:50.074
Take a look at these companies
and tell me what you think.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.534
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.

40:54.995 --> 40:56.413
Sure.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.929
These companies aren't the question,
are they?

41:13.388 --> 41:14.640
Explain.

41:14.723 --> 41:18.268
Unless you're playing
both sides of the fence.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.187
Control the whole power enchilada,
but, no,

41:20.270 --> 41:22.731
these companies wouldn't get you there
in emerging markets.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.858
You would have to... Oh. Whoa.

41:24.942 --> 41:28.612
This must be some big-ass merger
you're contemplating.

41:30.781 --> 41:32.574
And there's really only one company
with enough bling

41:32.658 --> 41:34.660
to justify a merger
with Van Loon and Associates.

41:35.953 --> 41:37.663
Who have you been talking to?

41:37.746 --> 41:41.375
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

41:41.458 --> 41:45.003
Well, you're an amazing con artist,
or you're a very smart young man.

41:45.087 --> 41:47.798
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?

41:47.881 --> 41:49.424
The whole world would have
to come begging for energy

41:49.508 --> 41:51.552
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel.

41:51.635 --> 41:54.138
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?

41:54.221 --> 41:58.475
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?

41:58.559 --> 42:01.937
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?

42:03.147 --> 42:06.483
Well, you don't want to hear this from
some schmuck who needs a ride home.

42:06.567 --> 42:10.237
All right, you get your shot. Meet me
tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

42:10.320 --> 42:12.573
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck
who needs a ride home

42:12.656 --> 42:15.909
would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.

42:15.993 --> 42:17.494
I'm at your disposal.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.580
You don't really live here,
do you?

42:19.663 --> 42:21.874
Well... Spartans weren't
big on amenities.

42:22.541 --> 42:25.169
Yeah, and they eventually
got their asses kicked.

42:32.426 --> 42:37.764
<i>I didn't go in. I wanted
to walk, move, digest, ingest.</i>

42:37.848 --> 42:41.143
<i>There are moments in life... moments
when you know you've crossed a bridge.</i>

42:41.226 --> 42:42.561
<i>Your old life is over.</i>

42:42.644 --> 42:45.522
<i>Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.</i>

42:45.606 --> 42:49.109
<i>Wall Street would provide my nest egg,
but then how far could I go?</i>

42:49.193 --> 42:52.905
<i>CEO? A global force?
Maybe President.</i>

42:52.988 --> 42:55.741
<i>Time somebody shook up the free world
and got things done.</i>

43:07.794 --> 43:09.546
<i>Suddenly...</i>

43:11.381 --> 43:16.220
<i>It was another skip.
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?</i>

43:18.430 --> 43:22.684
<i>I got another ten blocks.
And then...</i>

43:25.062 --> 43:27.189
<i>...I was way uptown.</i>

44:10.482 --> 44:12.818
<i>What bar was this?</i>

44:25.455 --> 44:28.959
...black canvas and then they would
just drop all the paint...

44:31.086 --> 44:33.505
Yeah. Did you ever meet...

44:34.631 --> 44:37.217
...and then I actually went
there and had lunch, I went back.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.343
My friends are rolling...

44:40.595 --> 44:42.514
<i>I heard you like to party.</i>

45:06.621 --> 45:08.874
- Hey, watch it.
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

45:08.957 --> 45:12.002
<i>A fight? Don't know how to fight.</i>

45:12.085 --> 45:13.545
<i>Or do I?</i>

45:22.137 --> 45:23.138
Ah!

45:23.221 --> 45:26.058
<i>You use the fishhook action
to get inside the mouth.</i>

45:26.933 --> 45:29.352
- <i>Like this.</i>

45:38.111 --> 45:41.990
<i>Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.</i>

45:46.661 --> 45:49.706
<i>If you are hit, do not stop.</i>

45:49.790 --> 45:52.375
<i>Your persistence will
discourage your attacker.</i>

45:54.086 --> 45:55.212
<i>Off-balancing your opponent</i>

45:55.295 --> 45:58.173
<i>and then using his momentum,
take him down.</i>

46:29.204 --> 46:31.540
<i>When it finally stopped,</i>

46:31.623 --> 46:35.168
<i>I couldn't account
for the last 18 hours of my life.</i>

46:57.274 --> 46:59.943
<i>Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.</i>

47:00.026 --> 47:02.779
<i>Is everything OK?
Call me when you get this.</i>

47:42.402 --> 47:47.199
<i>Even off NZT, I decided
to give Van Loon's files a shot.</i>

47:54.331 --> 47:56.625
<i>They were hieroglyphs.</i>

48:00.003 --> 48:02.589
- Hello?
<i>- Kevin, this is Eddie.</i>

48:02.672 --> 48:03.673
- Eddie?
<i>- Listen,</i>

48:03.757 --> 48:06.718
<i>- I can't make the meeting today.</i>
- What are you talking about?

48:08.053 --> 48:09.429
I can't come in today, I'm sick.

48:09.512 --> 48:11.723
Yeah, well you can't
have the flu right now.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.099
He'll never give you this chance again.

48:13.183 --> 48:18.772
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...

48:18.855 --> 48:21.608
<i>What have you been doing
for the last day?</i>

48:23.068 --> 48:25.946
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.

48:26.655 --> 48:29.616
Yeah, well, I can't
pass the test right now.

48:29.699 --> 48:31.826
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

48:31.910 --> 48:34.621
<i>- I know, listen, I just...</i>
- Sh. Listen to me.

48:34.704 --> 48:37.457
Pull yourself together.
Get down to the meeting.

48:43.964 --> 48:47.509
- OK, OK.
- I'll be there. I'll be there.

49:08.989 --> 49:11.283
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.

49:11.366 --> 49:13.034
Good to see you again.

49:14.286 --> 49:15.620
Sit down.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.084
What do you know about Hank Atwood?

49:21.751 --> 49:23.003
Atwood, um...

49:24.379 --> 49:26.965
He's an iconoclast, um...

49:30.051 --> 49:31.970
Owns about half of Colorado.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.056
So this is prepared, Eddie?

49:35.140 --> 49:37.142
Uh...

49:37.225 --> 49:40.395
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

49:40.478 --> 49:42.147
Where was he two years ago?

49:44.607 --> 49:47.485
- Hm?
- Nowhere.

49:49.237 --> 49:52.240
Two years ago he wasn't
even on <i>Forbes'</i> radar.

49:53.616 --> 49:56.119
That was a great leap forward, right?

49:56.995 --> 50:00.749
I'm baffled by this guy.
He comes out of nowhere so strong.

50:00.832 --> 50:03.752
Has me on the run before I can
even get to anybody in his camp.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.503
Beats me out of two properties,

50:05.587 --> 50:08.173
investing in countries with no oil.
Places I'd never go near...

50:15.555 --> 50:17.891
<i>We're here in front
of the hotel where a woman,</i>

50:17.974 --> 50:21.728
<i>identified as Maria Winberg,
was found dead in her room last night,</i>

50:21.811 --> 50:26.524
<i>a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg
was a well-known socialite and model...</i>

50:27.984 --> 50:32.238
<i>...but was also known for her dedicated
charity work around the city.</i>

50:32.322 --> 50:35.492
<i>Police spent hours questioning
hotel staff and patrons</i>

50:35.575 --> 50:38.787
<i>and an eyewitness reported
seeing a man leaving the scene...</i>

50:38.870 --> 50:42.582
...help me convince him that I can
raise his game. Got any ideas?

50:42.665 --> 50:44.417
What do you think?

50:45.794 --> 50:47.629
- Hm?
- Um...

50:47.712 --> 50:50.173
<i>...hotel has adequate
security cameras...</i>

50:54.469 --> 50:57.305
You're not one of those
kind of guys, are you Eddie?

50:57.389 --> 50:59.474
We lose you if there's
a screen in the room?

51:01.726 --> 51:04.437
These are tectonic plates
that are shifting right under us.

51:04.521 --> 51:06.147
Pardon me, one second.

51:28.294 --> 51:31.881
<i>Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?</i>

51:33.925 --> 51:36.052
<i>Was it even me?</i>

51:40.723 --> 51:43.351
<i>Eddie? This is Melissa.</i>

51:43.435 --> 51:45.603
<i>Listen, Vernon hasn't been
giving you anything, has he?</i>

51:45.687 --> 51:47.313
<i>Because that stuff is dangerous.</i>

51:47.397 --> 51:48.857
Melissa?

51:48.940 --> 51:51.276
Melissa, hey, do you think
that we can meet somewhere?

51:51.359 --> 51:54.028
- I really need to talk to you.
<i>- We're talking now.</i>

51:54.112 --> 51:57.449
No, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?

51:57.532 --> 51:59.868
<i>- You can't see me, Eddie.</i>
- No, no...

51:59.951 --> 52:03.037
<i>- Eddie, please.</i>
- Please, please come, please come, I...

52:03.121 --> 52:06.207
It's important, I really need to know
what you're talking about.

52:08.793 --> 52:12.046
<i>I realized that there were
other people who might know about NZT.</i>

52:12.130 --> 52:14.507
<i>Vernon's other clients.</i>

52:54.297 --> 52:55.256
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Yeah, hi,

52:55.340 --> 52:56.799
may I please speak with Jerry Brady?

52:56.883 --> 52:59.260
<i>- Jerry's in the hospital.</i>
- He's what?

52:59.344 --> 53:01.221
<i>Yeah, he's not doing well at all.</i>

53:01.304 --> 53:06.142
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
<i>- Uh, no. No, he's not.</i>

53:06.226 --> 53:09.521
<i>Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.</i>

53:10.647 --> 53:12.398
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

53:12.482 --> 53:15.068
<i>Yeah, he started getting headaches,
then he collapsed at work.</i>

53:15.151 --> 53:16.569
<i>Now he's in the ICU.</i>

53:16.653 --> 53:18.863
OK, please give him my best.
Thank you.

53:18.947 --> 53:24.327
<i>Of all the people I called...
three were dead and the rest were sick.</i>

53:47.267 --> 53:51.896
Hello? Hello?

54:10.081 --> 54:11.082
Watch it, man!

54:28.391 --> 54:29.475
Did you see that?

54:31.019 --> 54:32.020
Hey!

54:37.859 --> 54:41.279
Go! Go!

55:08.139 --> 55:09.432
Eddie.

55:11.476 --> 55:13.311
Melissa.

55:20.568 --> 55:21.861
Hey.

55:25.782 --> 55:29.077
Don't tell me I look good,
'cause I know.

55:31.037 --> 55:33.039
I didn't want you to see me this way.

55:33.665 --> 55:35.500
You look good.

55:35.583 --> 55:38.294
Oh, I, uh...

55:38.378 --> 55:40.421
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.

55:40.505 --> 55:42.965
NZT will do that to you.

55:43.049 --> 55:45.968
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.

55:46.928 --> 55:49.681
Vernon didn't tell you
any of this, did he?

55:49.764 --> 55:50.848
No.

55:50.932 --> 55:52.642
Well, when he told me
about this amazing new drug,

55:52.725 --> 55:56.688
I was like, down the hatch.
And it was. It was amazing.

55:56.771 --> 56:00.441
I read Brian Greene's
The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes

56:00.525 --> 56:02.360
and I understood it.

56:02.443 --> 56:04.737
My work rate increased
just insanely overnight

56:04.821 --> 56:06.531
and my boss started to hate me.

56:08.324 --> 56:13.204
They offered me his job and then...
and then I got scared.

56:14.122 --> 56:16.374
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.

56:16.457 --> 56:19.711
Nobody can operate at that level
of mental activity and not crash.

56:22.547 --> 56:24.424
I stopped taking it.

56:24.507 --> 56:28.845
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.

56:28.928 --> 56:34.267
Throwing up.
So I went back to Vernon.

56:34.350 --> 56:36.853
He told me about all the people
that were dying.

56:38.146 --> 56:40.106
How much have you
been taking, Eddie?

56:40.189 --> 56:41.858
I've been taking a lot.

56:43.443 --> 56:47.864
Well, maybe... maybe they've
worked out the bugs. Maybe...

56:48.740 --> 56:50.324
Maybe this is a different batch.

56:51.743 --> 56:54.579
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?

56:54.662 --> 56:57.165
- Just finish your story.
- Well...

56:57.248 --> 57:00.084
...I didn't take any more
and I didn't die.

57:01.419 --> 57:04.505
But after a while, I realized I
couldn't concentrate on anything

57:04.589 --> 57:05.798
for longer than ten minutes.

57:05.882 --> 57:10.970
I, uh... I missed deadlines,
got lazy, slow, so slow.

57:11.679 --> 57:14.140
That was two years ago.

57:16.100 --> 57:18.144
And I haven't been the same since.

57:22.857 --> 57:26.736
Do you have some left? Good.

57:26.819 --> 57:30.198
You go home and you take it. You take
the dose down, but you don't just stop.

57:30.281 --> 57:32.033
You'll die if you just stop.

57:32.658 --> 57:37.455
Try to taper off, otherwise
the headaches are just the beginning.

57:39.624 --> 57:41.000
I have to go.

57:42.919 --> 57:45.463
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.

57:47.048 --> 57:48.508
I have to go.

58:19.205 --> 58:24.001
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.

58:24.085 --> 58:25.795
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no.

58:25.878 --> 58:27.839
12:00 and you're not here.

58:27.922 --> 58:31.092
- I'm here now. Oh!
- Good.

58:31.175 --> 58:34.220
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.

58:34.303 --> 58:39.267
Check. Check.
Are you out of your mind?

58:39.350 --> 58:41.602
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?

58:41.686 --> 58:43.771
All right. You're right.
Look, we just need to go to a bank...

58:48.359 --> 58:50.736
What do you got there?

58:55.032 --> 58:57.451
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.

58:57.535 --> 59:03.040
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
It's something good, huh?

59:21.809 --> 59:25.938
I feel good, man.
What's in this stuff?

59:26.022 --> 59:28.816
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin.

59:28.900 --> 59:32.612
You full of shit, Eddie baby.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.057
Lindy. I wouldn't
have let him in, but...

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.893
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.771
I'm sick.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:12.151
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:15.321
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.447
I need you to get...

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.534
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:23.204
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:26.040
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.043
They're... it's...

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.463
<i>I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.</i>

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:38.552
So all this energy of yours,
all this focus...

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:39.929
...has been a drug.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.390
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:46.060
I have a... a supply stashed.

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:49.563
You want me to go get it.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:53.109
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.

01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.860
I'll go to your apartment.

01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:58.823
It's not... in my apartment.
I moved it.

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:02.702
OK, so where did you move it?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.377
In my house.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:14.672
Unbelievable.

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:29.687
Hey, have you got it?

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:31.355
Yeah.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:34.942
There's someone following me.

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:37.737
Are you sure?

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.281
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.366
and he's making every turn I'm making.

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:46.287
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.621
<i>Babe, what's happening?</i>

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:49.498
We're stopped dead.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:53.169
He's getting out.

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:55.796
Eddie, he's walking over here.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.881
Lindy?

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:58.883
Oh, God!

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.886
Ow!

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.984
Help! Help!

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:21.155
This man's...
This man's chasing me!

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.784
He followed me from
my building. I don't know him.

01:02:24.867 --> 01:02:28.245
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:32.917
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.129
Hey, buddy, are you
trying to piss me off?

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:41.175
What are you doing, man?

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.626
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.879
I'm stuck. He'll find me.

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.965
<i>OK, stop talking. Don't move.</i>

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:23.717
<i>- He killed two guys.
- What?</i>

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.971
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.222
Can he see you?

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.435
No.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.021
Not yet.

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:39.942
I don't know what to do.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:43.737
OK, I need you to go into the bag
and take one of the pills.

01:03:44.572 --> 01:03:45.823
Why?

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:48.325
<i>Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.</i>

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:52.329
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't
think my way out of a knife.

01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.624
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:57.585
And you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:24.695
He's getting closer.

01:04:27.323 --> 01:04:28.824
Lindy, I love you.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.441
Hey!

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.730
Now turn to me...

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.275
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:49.655
- Ah!
- Daddy!

01:05:49.738 --> 01:05:51.281
Ah!

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.583
Eddie. Here.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:04.795
It's gonna be OK.

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:10.592
We've got to get out of here. Eddie?

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:46.086
You OK?

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.339
Yeah.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.553
I'm so sorry about what happened.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.723
I want you to know that you never,
ever have to go through that again,

01:06:57.806 --> 01:07:00.559
'cause I can take care of us now.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.686
I'm sure you can.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.230
I can make us safe.
I'm back, OK?

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.862
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.364
No. It's not you.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:18.035
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:19.745
I wasn't, when I was on it.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.082
I did things I would never do.

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:25.751
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.377
Yes, they were.
No, the way it works...

01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:29.922
I know how it works. I get it.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:32.800
I totally get it.
You feel invincible.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:36.720
Where it will take us, Lin,
you can't even imagine.

01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:41.225
The things we'll be able to do.
Where we'll be a year from now.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.978
The kind of life that
we'll finally be able to live.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:48.273
Well, you might have
to live it without me.

01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:54.947
Look, I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.575
to keep us safe and that... To set us up
and then I'm gonna get off it.

01:07:58.659 --> 01:08:00.244
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:02.621
Look, I have a plan. I swear.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.498
I'm gonna get off it.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:07.292
OK.

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:10.838
I hope you do.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.912
Looking for me?

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:50.961
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:52.796
I was under the impression
our business was settled.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.673
I want some more of that stuff.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:57.718
Or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.595
<i>This guy was not going away.</i>

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:01.430
<i>A few pills would buy me some time.</i>

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:04.892
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:07.519
<i>Until I found a more...
permanent solution.</i>

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:12.107
Unless you see a real threat, I never
want it known that I have any security.

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:14.401
You'll never precede me,
you'll always follow me.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:17.946
Never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.741
I want to able to look behind me
if the opportunity presents itself.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.411
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't The Matrix.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:32.336
You have to know, Eddie,
I wrote you off.

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.046
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:36.840
You're playing at this level, you get
hit by a car, you don't even die.

01:09:36.924 --> 01:09:39.593
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.553
I mean, I didn't know who or what
I was talking to.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:44.848
A hundred and five. That's who
you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

01:09:44.932 --> 01:09:47.475
Mmm-hm.

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.269
I sent over my revised projections.

01:09:49.353 --> 01:09:50.270
I didn't ask for your projections.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.439
I know, but I think if
you take a look at them...

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.525
I already have.
As a matter of fact...

01:09:57.069 --> 01:10:00.280
...I fired a few people
over your projections.

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:01.990
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

01:10:02.074 --> 01:10:04.868
You're relieved that you know things
my team missed.

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:09.498
The minute,
the instant that's no longer true...

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.002
<i>Two months after I'd started NZT,</i>

01:10:14.086 --> 01:10:17.172
<i>I was brokering the biggest merger
in corporate history.</i>

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:21.677
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude
is gonna be where we're gonna hit them.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.388
Which yields a prospective profit
of 200 percent.

01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:26.348
That makes both of us
very happy campers.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.809
<i>I found that if
I maintained an even dose,</i>

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.228
<i>remembered to eat,
drank no alcohol,</i>

01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:33.730
<i>the blackouts didn't recur.</i>
- How you doing, Eddie?

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:37.651
Tom, is it possible to construct
an imperceptible compartment?

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.194
In this jacket?

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:42.698
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:46.868
<i>Safer though my stash now was, I
was not sitting around until it ran out.</i>

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:50.289
Can I combine these ingredients
in the same exact quantity, yes, but,

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:55.168
the exact method of delivery
to the brain... Darts at a dartboard.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:57.879
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:00.465
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.

01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:04.052
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...

01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:06.263
I'll give you two million dollars
if you can do it in six.

01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:18.734
I found that we can cut costs
30 percent and, um...

01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:23.488
Excuse me one second.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:29.202
I thought we straightened this out,
Detective.

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:33.206
This isn't about Vernon Gant,
Mr. Morra.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:35.667
What is this about?

01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:41.089
The witness identified the Maria Winberg
suspect as this person.

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:48.680
Wanna tell me your whereabouts
the night of April 2nd?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.851
<i>I couldn't keep
this quiet on my own.</i>

01:11:54.019 --> 01:11:58.523
<i>Enter Morris Brandt...
the most lethal lawyer in New York.</i>

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:06.198
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.

01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:09.284
Just between us, were you there?

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.619
I don't remember.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:13.747
I don't want to
make concessions to you...

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.874
<i>Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood</i>

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:19.961
<i>had no idea I might
soon be charged with murder.</i>

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:22.714
But SyCorps, Andine
and others are jockeying

01:12:22.798 --> 01:12:24.800
for the same industrial
concessions in Libya

01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:27.135
that both our companies are
pretending we're not sniffing out.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:28.595
How do you know this?

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:32.265
The governmental bribe system
is itself corrupt, so, of course,

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:35.477
information about its inner workings,
like anything, can be bought.

01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:39.439
Go on.

01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:42.901
If you take a look at the lower
left-hand column, in 2008,

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:46.405
five companies were jockeying for a
position before we even took notice.

01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:51.493
Jesus, he looks frail.

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:54.913
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

01:12:57.249 --> 01:13:00.293
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:03.463
When this is over? I don't know.

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.923
You haven't given me the answer.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:06.842
You haven't asked the question.

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.677
Well, given the scale
of my contribution,

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.096
let's say 45.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:14.182
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:17.686
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.063
You know, Eddie...

01:13:20.147 --> 01:13:21.189
...it may be on your mind

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.692
that you're not gonna
continue to work for me any more.

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.485
This has been
the learning experience of my life.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:28.029
I hope it has. I hope you don't
think you've gotten enough from me.

01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:29.656
On to the next.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.492
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:35.036
That you would even think that
would only show me

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.539
how unprepared you are
to be on your own.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.000
- I mean, you do know you're a freak.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.586
Your deductive powers are a gift
from God, or chance,

01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:45.005
or a stray shot of sperm,
or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:47.382
your life script, a gift not earned.

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:51.344
You do not know what I know because
you have not earned those powers.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.138
You're careless with those powers.

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:56.516
You flaunt them and you throw them
around like a brat with his trust fund.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.561
You haven't had to climb up
all the greasy little rungs.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:02.606
You haven't been bored blind at the
fundraisers. You haven't done the time

01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:04.524
in that first marriage
to the girl with the right father.

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:07.319
You think you can leap
over all in a single bound.

01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:09.905
You haven't had to bribe
or charm or threaten your way

01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:13.200
to a seat at that table. You don't
know how to assess your competition

01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:16.495
because you haven't competed.
Don't make me your competition.

01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:21.374
Now, I'll open up
a line of credit for you.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.502
You'll be wanting a few toys.

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.855
<i>Hotel rooms
were no longer an option.</i>

01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:45.941
<i>What I needed was a bunker.</i>

01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:48.443
<i>There's a built-in safe,
central surveillance,</i>

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:51.112
<i>vault grade pneumatic doors.</i>

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:54.491
It's an unparalleled
three-tier security system.

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:57.953
A fortress with a hell of a view.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:04.960
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:11.341
I'll take it.

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:19.808
<i>Right away, it was obvious
he was on NZT.</i>

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:22.561
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:24.604
- Next week, you can go fuck yourself!

01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:26.273
Not that you'd feel anything.

01:15:27.232 --> 01:15:30.902
I don't think your Fortune 500
financial friends would appreciate

01:15:30.986 --> 01:15:34.114
the details of your little dilemma
with the police.

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:37.826
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.289
Getting smarter!

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.167
<i>Obviously, this could not go on,</i>

01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:49.421
<i>but there is very little on this earth
that 40 million dollars can't solve.</i>

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:53.133
<i>And tomorrow at nine,
Atwood would sign the papers.</i>

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:03.476
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.146
There was all last night
to tell us that.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:10.942
- Anything?
<i>- I'll call him again, sir.</i>

01:16:11.026 --> 01:16:13.236
OK, the decision could
have changed. That makes sense.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.698
The discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.701
Oh, based on your charts
and projections.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.871
You know, remind me,
who the fuck are you, anyway?

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:25.665
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this
unqualified, posturing little prick.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.876
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:31.796
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.340
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.678
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.

01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.181
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:46.227
I wanted to make this
as confidential as possible.

01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:47.896
Of course.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:51.900
My husband experienced some pain
and dizziness this morning.

01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:54.527
He's currently at Lenox Hill,
undergoing tests.

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.697
I just want you to know
we have every intention

01:16:57.781 --> 01:16:59.491
of signing the contract.

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:03.536
And as soon as he is able,
we will proceed.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:07.624
I realize this is a useless platitude,
but if there's anything that we can do,

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:09.042
please don't hesitate to tell us.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.960
Obviously, we want to be
as helpful and respectful

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.587
as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.465
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.

01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:18.551
There won't be a proxy.

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:21.679
No, a cagey prick like him
giving away power of attorney?

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.144
Well, he'd better get better.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:35.693
<i>But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.</i>

01:17:39.197 --> 01:17:42.742
Well, why be surprised?

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:46.246
<i>How many other meteoric rises
might be explained by NZT?</i>

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:47.747
<i>At /east I had some.</i>

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.958
<i>- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.</i>

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:53.044
<i>Only my money. And my liberty.</i>

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:55.839
I've been all over with them.

01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:58.299
We can't allow
any disparity in race

01:17:58.383 --> 01:18:01.136
or physical type between you
and the rest of the line up.

01:18:01.219 --> 01:18:02.178
OK.

01:18:02.262 --> 01:18:04.639
They're as close to your clones
as I could possibly get.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:08.476
<i>It's gotta be just one big
handsome blur to this guy.</i>

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.159
<i>Who was out there?</i>

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.787
<i>The woman's husband?</i>

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.498
<i>A hotel maid?</i>

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:34.961
<i>Was this how it was all going to end?</i>

01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:41.843
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:44.846
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:50.351
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?

01:18:50.435 --> 01:18:52.020
I did.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.705
<i>...market's been mixed today.</i>

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:13.500
<i>The Dow has been yo-yoing
amidst speculation that.</i>

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:18.296
<i>Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood
have negotiated a merger...</i>

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.174
Have you been talking to anyone?

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:25.386
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.721
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.723
but don't make the classic
smart person's mistake.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:30.683
Thinking no one's smarter than you.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:33.895
Where the hell have you been? This is
the second time you've turned to vapor.

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.856
I was in the building, I was getting
coffee. Why, has there been movement?

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.234
Yeah, there's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:41.861
He wasn't playing us.
He's dying.

01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:43.530
What do you know about this?

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:47.200
<i>I was less than
usually equipped to answer.</i>

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.621
<i>The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.</i>

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:54.916
<i>And the pain was
starting behind my eyes.</i>

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.251
Excuse me.

01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:57.835
You're not excused.

01:19:57.919 --> 01:20:00.463
What? A man in your employ
can't take a piss, Carl?

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:25.029
<i>Was it Brandt or someone else?</i>

01:20:25.113 --> 01:20:27.699
<i>The police station?
A coatroom?</i>

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:42.964
Mr. Morra.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.550
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:47.385
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?

01:20:51.973 --> 01:20:55.893
Hope not, so let me know
when you know.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:58.563
All right, I'm gonna ask you again,
Eddie. What do you know about this?

01:20:58.646 --> 01:21:01.608
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.

01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:03.526
What? What about Atwood?

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.862
Look, you got a long way to go
as a liar, kiddo.

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:07.155
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.615
What you're about to say is bullshit.

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.199
I know there's something
you're hiding from me.

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:12.160
I smell it on you. Right now,

01:21:12.243 --> 01:21:15.622
I wanna know why this clusterfuck
of a deal is dead in the water!

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:19.334
Carl.

01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:21.419
Eddie! Eddie!

01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:39.896
<i>Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,</i>

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:42.732
<i>more twists and turns
in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.</i>

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:46.611
<i>There is absolutely no truth
to the rumor of this merger.</i>

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:50.406
<i>None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.</i>

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.575
<i>This is a difficult time.</i>

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:56.579
<i>We would appreciate your directing
further questions to our attorney.</i>

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.082
<i>Yes, we have no further comments
at this time.</i>

01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:01.584
<i>We're just awaiting the results
of the latest round of tests</i>

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:02.627
<i>and hoping for the best.</i>

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.128
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:47.547
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.717
Open up.

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.055
Come on.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.184
Open the door.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:19.620
<i>And so, here I am.</i>

01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:25.084
<i>I knew they would kill me
slowly and horribly.</i>

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:28.296
<i>But this choice
would at /east be mine.</i>

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:42.059
<i>But we're instinctive creatures.
We want to live.</i>

01:23:42.143 --> 01:23:46.647
<i>So my foggy brain tried to remember
where one tablet of NZT might be.</i>

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:58.701
<i>It was possible.
And possible was enough.</i>

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:23.643
Hey, Eddie.

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:49.418
Now you know I want more,
so why would you upset me?

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.339
I don't like being down
to this last one.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.341
You don't even know how to use it.

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.760
You don't appreciate it.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.930
You see, I dissolve in a solution.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:05.685
You shoot it. It goes straight
into the blood and brain.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.480
Lasts much longer.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.913
So...

01:25:25.997 --> 01:25:28.624
You gonna tell me where the rest is?

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.376
I'm plumb out.

01:25:35.006 --> 01:25:37.717
You know, these guys are gonna find it.

01:25:38.884 --> 01:25:41.429
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:44.473
Question is, which is gonna come first?

01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:47.560
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:54.525
This is a waste of my time,
you know?

01:25:54.609 --> 01:25:57.528
I'm getting out
of this side of the business.

01:25:57.612 --> 01:26:02.325
I'm branching out.
I'm starting import-export company.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.327
Very exciting stuff.

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:08.039
I got a lot on my plate.
You're lucky I'm here.

01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:21.552
Back in the old times, I might
peel your skin back. Fillet you.

01:26:21.636 --> 01:26:24.388
"Fillet." It's a nice word.

01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:29.185
I didn't know this before.
Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.442
But then I discovered
this thing, Google.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:40.571
Did you know the small and large
intestines is 20 foot long?

01:26:40.655 --> 01:26:42.490
I had no idea.
I don't believe it.

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:46.369
I gotta see this for myself.
I'm dubious. It's another nice word.

01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:50.790
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:53.376
Don't worry, everything's sterilized.

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:56.504
We're gonna keep you alive
for the whole shebang.

01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:58.756
You're gonna get
a front row seat, Eddie.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:03.094
What?

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:07.682
- Ah!

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:38.337
<i>Not much of a triumph, was it?</i>

01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:40.631
<i>Because I would die here, too.</i>

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:47.054
<i>Only NZT could help me and the last
of it was in this fuck's bloodstream.</i>

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.006
Victor!

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:13.390
What?

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:21.941
Ah!

01:29:27.488 --> 01:29:28.697
Hey!

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:31.450
Ah!

01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.336
Ah!

01:30:22.793 --> 01:30:23.794
Victor?

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.299
Victor?

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:30.801
Victor?

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:21.936
<i>The police would later note</i>

01:31:22.019 --> 01:31:24.647
<i>that my apartment's previous
owner was an arms dealer.</i>

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:29.902
<i>Of course, these intruders had
been his dissatisfied clients.</i>

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:32.613
<i>And the night was still young.</i>

01:31:45.084 --> 01:31:47.211
I'm sure you're curious
about what happened to your boss.

01:31:47.294 --> 01:31:49.421
I know I certainly am.

01:31:49.505 --> 01:31:52.341
I mean, if my attorney was
really working for Mr. Atwood,

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:56.679
trying to save his life,
why is he dead?

01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:59.348
I mean, at what point was
the pony express supposed to ride in

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:01.517
with his life-saving medication?

01:32:02.559 --> 01:32:04.603
<i>His boss was dead.</i>

01:32:04.687 --> 01:32:08.774
<i>So, I didn't matter now.</i>

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:13.570
<i>But he did not appreciate that Morris
Brandt had kept the pills for himself.</i>

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:27.876
<i>And it was all still possible.</i>

01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:48.856
Actually, no, there's no more tickets.

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:53.402
Yeah, I know. An overbooked fundraiser.
That's a first.

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:55.154
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.322
Oh, that's much better.

01:32:57.406 --> 01:32:59.950
- Great job.
- Thank you, sir.

01:33:00.034 --> 01:33:01.160
Hi, Mr. Morra.

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:03.078
Edward!

01:33:04.455 --> 01:33:06.707
I think we're looking
at a second overflow event.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.792
There's a wave of donations coming in
and I don't think

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:11.170
they're even gonna
try a second debate.

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:12.504
- Great.
- Hold on.

01:33:12.588 --> 01:33:14.214
A guy from
Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.

01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:16.050
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.

01:33:16.133 --> 01:33:17.342
Give him his two crappy little minutes.

01:33:17.426 --> 01:33:19.803
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.391
Finally get to meet the guys
that keep the lights on.

01:33:25.893 --> 01:33:27.686
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.

01:33:29.146 --> 01:33:32.649
What a surprise. They told me somebody
from Eiben was coming.

01:33:32.733 --> 01:33:36.070
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm
moving out of the energy business.

01:33:36.153 --> 01:33:39.865
Come on. That's like Hef
moving out of the mansion.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:43.202
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months
ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.

01:33:43.285 --> 01:33:47.331
No. No. Well, they really
keep me hopping here.

01:33:47.414 --> 01:33:50.209
Well, it's gonna pay off,
Senator Morra.

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:53.921
The Senate. Who knows...

01:33:54.004 --> 01:33:57.341
Everything's a technicality
from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

01:33:58.008 --> 01:34:02.596
I think we both know where it's headed,
if you can maintain.

01:34:05.432 --> 01:34:08.644
Have you asked yourself what
you're gonna do when you run out?

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:27.329
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:31.834
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.

01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:33.335
We could have been partners.

01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:38.924
So, Eiben makes NZT.

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.802
Well, it'll never officially exist.

01:34:41.885 --> 01:34:44.429
Obviously, I don't need
to point out the advantages for you.

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:46.849
Oh, I think maybe you do.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:50.853
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get any more.

01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:52.437
You sure about that?

01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:54.356
They shut down your lab this morning.

01:34:56.859 --> 01:35:00.404
Eddie. I just want to help you,
that's all.

01:35:00.487 --> 01:35:03.448
Keep you supplied.
No disruption in service.

01:35:03.532 --> 01:35:05.617
Give you peace of mind.
That's all.

01:35:07.286 --> 01:35:10.289
And in return, I do what?

01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:14.168
Get a little advice, maybe.
I won't be bothering you much at first.

01:35:14.251 --> 01:35:16.712
And later. What are you
gonna be bothering me with?

01:35:16.795 --> 01:35:20.465
Well, given where you're heading,
some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:22.426
But hey, I think they're achievable.

01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:24.261
And what if I don't like your ideas?

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:26.722
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:30.309
And your candle will have shed a brief,
but lovely light.

01:35:32.186 --> 01:35:33.645
But you know what, Eddie,
let's not even

01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:34.730
go there right now.

01:35:34.813 --> 01:35:38.108
Right now, I just want
to keep you brilliant...

01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:41.904
...and healthy. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.

01:36:00.172 --> 01:36:02.132
After you, Senator.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.594
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.

01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:08.222
Give us a second.

01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:11.016
What are you doing? Do you want
to be President of the United States

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.769
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:17.064
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.

01:36:17.147 --> 01:36:18.357
You don't think some smartass on NZT

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.025
might have two or three
or even four labs?

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:22.277
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.

01:36:22.361 --> 01:36:24.404
I thought better of it.
See, once you know what's in it,

01:36:24.488 --> 01:36:28.116
you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:30.160
I'm off it, Carl.

01:36:30.244 --> 01:36:31.495
Well, on it or off it,

01:36:31.578 --> 01:36:33.872
there's no scenario
where you're not working for me.

01:36:33.956 --> 01:36:35.457
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:36.708
Last year you traded

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:38.710
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?

01:36:38.794 --> 01:36:41.880
Blank checks from Dubai.
Dumping in Chile. Disappeared officials.

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:44.049
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:46.218
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:48.262
There's no way you can be making
accusations like that

01:36:48.345 --> 01:36:50.681
and be walking around alive.

01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:53.350
That you would even think that shows me
how unprepared you are to fight me.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:54.977
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it,

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.437
but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?

01:36:57.521 --> 01:36:58.855
That I kept absolutely nothing?

01:36:58.939 --> 01:37:00.524
You have no idea what
kind of enemy I can be.

01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:03.443
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?

01:37:03.527 --> 01:37:06.196
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.073
He has 60 feet to stop.
He doesn't have room.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.908
- What van?

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:14.621
I see everything, Carl.

01:37:14.705 --> 01:37:16.999
I'm 50 moves ahead of you
and everybody else.

01:37:17.082 --> 01:37:19.418
What makes you think I don't have a guy
with a bead on you right now?

01:37:19.501 --> 01:37:21.211
How do you know you're gonna be alive
this time next year?

01:37:21.295 --> 01:37:24.423
What are you doing? You get
your hands off me. What are you doing?

01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:27.259
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:30.554
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're
gonna need to get that replaced.

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:33.974
But you already knew that.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:41.606
You know, you should
really be glad about this.

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:44.735
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch.

01:37:56.705 --> 01:37:59.458
Maybe we should cool off.
Talk again.

01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:03.170
I don't think so.

01:38:04.755 --> 01:38:06.006
Don't forget to vote.

01:38:14.306 --> 01:38:15.724
Edward.

01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:17.434
You good?

01:38:17.517 --> 01:38:20.479
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.779
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:33.408
- How's your day going?
- Ah. I've had better.

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.245
I still can't deal with that haircut.

01:38:37.329 --> 01:38:39.414
I wouldn't even
recognize you on the street.

01:38:39.498 --> 01:38:41.249
Well, I'm a new man.

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:43.585
I've already ordered.

01:38:59.518 --> 01:39:01.103
What?
