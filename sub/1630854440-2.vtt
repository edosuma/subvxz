WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:07.717
No matter how much we clean up,
there's always more.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.177
[Marcus]
That was the news station.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.930
They said the story did fine,
but they don't need a follow-up.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.434
Well, of course they don't.
Nobody wants to see this.

00:16.517 --> 00:20.980
There's barely enough shrimp out here
to catch because of this poison.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.983
Let's just unload the haul...
what there is of it.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.652
[suspenseful music playing]

00:34.994 --> 00:36.454
[whirring]

00:44.253 --> 00:46.005
[grunts]

00:46.088 --> 00:47.548
Are you okay?

00:47.631 --> 00:49.633
Yeah, I'm good.

00:52.136 --> 00:55.139
-[panting]
-[engine starts]

01:01.395 --> 01:04.023
[panting]

01:04.106 --> 01:06.108
[theme music playing]

01:23.959 --> 01:26.337
I've tried to get people
to see what's happening.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.633
Barges passing through drop containers
full of plastic waste out to sea.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.842
Nobody lifts a finger.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.636
These guys are for real.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.387
Not a trace of 'em.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.556
We'll get you back out there, DeDe.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.600
Yeah, but for how long?

01:39.683 --> 01:42.561
My family's been shrimping this gulf
for a hundred years.

01:42.645 --> 01:46.065
But with this crap out there, I don't know
if we'll make it another five.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.528
We finally got a reporter
to put us on the news,

01:50.611 --> 01:53.864
and all that happened was
people shrugged and changed the channel.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.075
Everyone except for Clyde Hammond.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.452
I mentioned his shipping company
in an interview.

01:58.536 --> 02:04.542
I have seen containers fall off
his barges, and the result is this.

02:05.918 --> 02:09.171
We came to Harry to see if
we could file charges against his thugs

02:09.255 --> 02:10.673
for what they did to our boat.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.843
Well, the difficulty is you don't
have much in the way of evidence.

02:13.926 --> 02:17.388
I believe you, but I think the police
are gonna want more than your word.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.015
The good news is that my friends
specialize in fixing problems

02:20.099 --> 02:21.392
that the system won't.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.644
We can't fix everything
that Hammond's broken,

02:23.727 --> 02:27.022
but we can make him pay
a real price for breaking it.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.358
Destroying my boat's one thing.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.027
Stealing my kid's future?

02:32.111 --> 02:34.530
I can't imagine anyone settling that debt.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.871
[Breanna] Clyde Hammond, self-made man
with a small fleet of barges.

02:41.954 --> 02:45.332
Does some commercial business,
but mostly transports plastic waste.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.959
Do we have a way in on him yet?

02:47.042 --> 02:49.420
[Breanna] Uh, nothing pops online,
but Harry's looking over the financials,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.881
and I got Eliot and Parker credentials
as dock workers.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.424
And they have Hammond under surveillance.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.768
I got him.
He's got a satellite phone.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.437
Who are you--

03:07.438 --> 03:09.732
[Parker] Is that phone really big
or are his hands really small?

03:09.815 --> 03:11.901
[sighs] Cartesian duality.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.111
Our senses are always deceiving us.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.696
[whispers] Never assume.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.990
That... [sighs]

03:18.073 --> 03:19.825
[beeping]

03:19.909 --> 03:22.703
Ugh. Hacking a sat phone's
so much harder than hacking a cell phone.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.205
Get his satellite provider anyway,
just in case.

03:25.915 --> 03:29.793
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
I got held up in court.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.003
Whoo!

03:32.421 --> 03:33.797
Seriously?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.884
We're doing a job on plastics,
Harry, and you bring that?

03:36.967 --> 03:37.885
That's recyclable.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.596
No, it is not.
That is a lie that they tell you.

03:40.679 --> 03:44.016
That stuff, it has to be separated,
and it has to go through a big mach--

03:44.099 --> 03:46.685
This, this brings me back
to our guy Hammond.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.730
So, Hammond ships tons
of America's plastic waste

03:49.813 --> 03:51.315
to India, Africa, and the Far East.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.942
But in 2019, most foreign countries,

03:53.025 --> 03:55.527
they signed an accord
making trash dumping illegal.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.071
However, we did not sign it.

03:57.154 --> 03:57.988
[sniffs]

03:58.072 --> 04:01.283
So it's technically legal
to export waste away from the US.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.827
Yes, but it is a crime
to dump it anywhere else.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.498
So Hammond saw an opportunity,
and now he makes a small fortune

04:07.581 --> 04:11.293
by taking plastic off the hands
of US manufacturers, recycling plants,

04:11.377 --> 04:13.420
shipping it away
to Southeast Asia and Africa,

04:13.504 --> 04:15.673
and then bribing
the local officials for peanuts

04:15.756 --> 04:17.299
to let him dump it there illegally,

04:17.383 --> 04:20.511
where, one way or another,
it turns into pollution.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.516
That's how I eat my Pad Woon Sen
without losing any noodles.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.351
I hope they taste like shame.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.769
They do now.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.231
So why does the waste end up in the gulf?

04:32.314 --> 04:33.148
Profit.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.192
Hammond takes on
more trash than he can unload

04:35.275 --> 04:38.070
and then dumps it
once he's out in international waters.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.115
Okay, one weird thing
about the financials: his office.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.741
It's a commercial space in a warehouse.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.410
He should have
bare-bones insurance coverage,

04:44.493 --> 04:46.328
but he's got a top-of-the-line policy.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.871
Only time I ever saw that at my old job

04:47.955 --> 04:50.708
was when the client had a collection,
either art or antiquities.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.084
Rich guys love their trophies.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.712
Yeah, but there's no record of him
buying anything worth insuring.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.006
So did he inherit a collection?

04:57.840 --> 04:58.716
Shipping.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.927
Everyone's watching what goes out
and not what comes in.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.637
He's a clever boy.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.640
I bet he even keeps
some of those containers full of trash

05:06.724 --> 05:08.726
to hide things in round-trip.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.396
I mean, what customs official
is gonna inspect the trash? It's trash.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.313
You're right.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.815
[Sophie] Eliot.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.527
Hammond is personally supervising
the unloading of this shipment.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.737
Does he do that for all of them?

05:19.820 --> 05:23.073
He hasn't opened one today or yesterday.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.367
[Parker]
Hammond's leaving.

05:25.451 --> 05:27.453
[Sophie]
Parker, don't lose him.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.460
Anton, let's bring out our cargo next.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.336
Then you guys start getting ready
for the auction.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.505
Take it up.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.727
Am I looking for something?

05:53.771 --> 05:57.608
[Sophie] You want to inspect the goods,
so a container from today's load.

06:02.738 --> 06:03.781
Look at you.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.286
Something in the trash.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.831
Ooh! Ornate Christian reliquary.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.250
Middle Eastern, by the looks of it.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.419
There's no way that was legally moved.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.506
So he's shipping trash out
and illegal antiquities in.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.383
And he's using those extra shipments
to hide his smuggling profits.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.927
Then he sells the antiquities here.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.471
Except for the trophies
that he skims for himself.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.056
Which he insures
but, of course, never paid for.

06:29.139 --> 06:29.973
[clicks tongue]

06:30.057 --> 06:33.894
Black-market smuggling is very illegal.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.647
That's why he didn't want DeDe
shining the spotlight on him.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.567
And that is how we're gonna get him.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.405
So if that can't be recycled...

06:45.489 --> 06:47.491
It is yours until you die.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.287
[Sophie]
So, from the top.

06:54.123 --> 06:59.128
Okay, so you're the art authenticator
for the insurance company.

06:59.211 --> 07:03.632
And that is a problem for Hammond. Why?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.385
Why? Because his collection is illegal.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.805
Uh, he doesn't have the paperwork
proving where he bought his antiquities.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.765
-Provenance.
-[Breanna] Right.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.725
So he offers to bribe you.

07:13.809 --> 07:18.105
[Greek accent] "Oh, sir, I'm shocked!
I am not that kind of woman!"

07:18.188 --> 07:20.190
And then you offer to help him.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.860
[Greek accent]
"Oh, sir, for that kind of money,

07:22.943 --> 07:24.820
I am that kind of woman!"

07:24.903 --> 07:28.991
And then we dig up enough deets to
shut down the entire smuggling operation.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.494
Okay, but it's just the corporations.

07:32.578 --> 07:35.080
They're just gonna keep making plastic,
and then that plastic is gonna

07:35.164 --> 07:39.543
keep ending up as pollution,
so why are we not going after them?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.253
And how does that help DeDe now?

07:42.504 --> 07:45.883
This team can't solve
the world's bigger problems.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.594
We're just...
We're not built for it.

07:48.677 --> 07:53.140
What we can do is help one person
and then the next, and then the next,

07:53.223 --> 07:57.060
and then we look back,
and you see how much you've changed.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.856
It's baby steps, Breanna.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.651
It's not enough.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.111
[upbeat music playing]

08:13.202 --> 08:17.039
We're in.
Let me know if you need me.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.875
I love being right.

08:19.958 --> 08:23.879
Hammond's place
is packed full of antiquities.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.799
What's up, man?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.762
-[Parker] We don't have cameras?
-[Breanna] Well, that's a federal port.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.348
It's too risky to hack
their security feeds, man.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.100
All right, Sophie, get a full inventory
in case we need to steal something.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.396
What? It's been three weeks
since we stole something.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.907
Who the hell are you?

08:51.990 --> 08:55.994
[Greek accent] Mr. Hammond, apologies,
but they should have contacted you.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.412
Athena Baros.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.624
I'm the antiquities authenticator
for your insurance company.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.459
[typing]

09:02.542 --> 09:03.835
[Hammond] Hmm...

09:06.797 --> 09:08.840
Oh, how the hell did I miss this?

09:08.924 --> 09:09.967
It's policy.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.302
I just need to compare your pieces
to your records of sales

09:12.386 --> 09:15.347
and provenance,
and I'll be out of your hair.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.767
Yeah, sure,
the, uh, provenance thing.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.352
I got those files somewhere.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.439
Uh, I'm pretty sure our plan
hinges on him not having those.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.025
He's got a source.
Some forger.

09:28.402 --> 09:32.281
[Greek accent]
I have to say, Mr. Hammond,

09:32.364 --> 09:36.159
your taste is exquisite.

09:36.243 --> 09:40.372
You know, I only consult
for the insurance company.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.251
It'd be a pleasure to work
on a collection of this quality.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.544
Oh.

09:45.627 --> 09:51.049
You need to expose these ivory tiles
to natural sunlight to keep them white.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.593
Really? Great catch.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.678
[gasps]

09:55.762 --> 09:59.099
Qing Dynasty, from the carvings.

09:59.182 --> 10:03.895
Perhaps even the original set
designed for the Empress Dowager Cixi.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.064
[chuckles] You really know your stuff.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.693
I won those playing poker
in the dirtiest slum in Sumatra.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.403
They remind me
sometimes you gotta get

10:11.486 --> 10:15.073
your hands a little dirty
to find real value.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.243
That'd be worth, like,
a couple million dollars.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.828
-Is that real?
-[normal voice] That one is.

10:19.911 --> 10:20.746
Beg pardon?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.959
[Greek accent]
That one is Yuan Dynasty, 15th century.

10:26.043 --> 10:26.877
Mm-hmm.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.004
[gasps] East Africa.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.758
[gasps]

10:32.841 --> 10:35.552
The Malindi Kingdom, if I'm not mistaken.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.387
Early 1600s?

10:37.471 --> 10:40.766
You have a terrific eye, Ms. Baros.
Let me get you those papers.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.934
[Parker] Yuan Dynasty wasn't in China
in the 15th century.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.478
You know Chinese history?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.438
I know what's worth stealing
from Chinese history,

10:46.521 --> 10:47.564
and that doesn't exist.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.192
There are fakes
mixed in with the real antiques.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.278
[normal voice] I know this work.
I have to get out of here.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.489
[Hammond] You certainly know every corner
of your field, Ms. Baros.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.657
But I already have a gifted authenticator.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.242
[gasps]

11:00.786 --> 11:01.661
Hello.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.163
[suspenseful music playing]

11:08.293 --> 11:09.669
Ms. Baros. Mr. Wilde.

11:09.753 --> 11:10.962
Baros.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.715
Baros.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.342
[snaps fingers]

11:21.014 --> 11:21.848
[Greek accent]
Athena.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.142
Yes! Athena Baros.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.936
Yes! [chuckles]

11:26.019 --> 11:27.562
Oh, I've heard wonderful things about you.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.481
-Arthur Wilde.
-Ah.

11:29.564 --> 11:33.068
You were brought onto that
Mesopotamian dig two years ago.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.698
They came to me, but I was busy
digging out a Burmese temple.

11:38.782 --> 11:39.950
[all laugh]

11:40.033 --> 11:44.204
[gasps] Wilde. Of course.
I've heard the name many times.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.333
You studied under Martha Downey
at the Leiden Program.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.627
I passed on that fellowship.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.796
She's an expert in her field.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.215
Does she want me to go in or not?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.469
[Breanna]
Uh, nothing concrete on Arthur Wilde yet.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.764
It's an alias. He's the forger
making provenance docs for Hammond.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.766
A forger she knows.

12:04.850 --> 12:05.684
[chuckles]

12:05.767 --> 12:08.019
If Mr. Hammond can spare me for a moment,

12:08.103 --> 12:12.774
I would love to discuss
your Greco-Roman discoveries.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.860
Yeah, sure.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.944
[chuckles]

12:23.785 --> 12:26.955
Of course. I finally start to
make a steady bit of income,

12:27.038 --> 12:28.915
and here you are
to cut the legs out from under me.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.667
-[normal voice] It's not what you think.
-No?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.295
You just wandered into Hammond's office
using your Greek accent

12:33.378 --> 12:36.423
with a touch of
"I'm so vulnerable, please protect me"

12:36.506 --> 12:37.340
and stroking his ego?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.426
To be fair, that part is what you think.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.345
But my question is,
how did you end up here?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.681
Well, it was certainly no thanks to you.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.808
It's been an interesting few decades.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.018
Who is this guy?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.644
I don't know, but I really hope

12:49.728 --> 12:51.480
it's as good as the fanfic
I'm writing in my head.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.485
So who are you now? Belinda? No.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.196
Kiki. You know, I liked Kiki.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.363
Charlotte.

13:00.489 --> 13:04.284
She was a bit too stuck up for me,
considering she did send me to prison.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.037
[Parker]
What happened? Is Sophie okay?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.246
Her audio just dropped out.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.708
She just took her comms out.
She's all right.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.170
Sophie Devereaux.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.965
[clicks tongue]
Sophie. Such a pleasure to meet you.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.718
Now, I have to insist, Sophie,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.137
that you get the hell away
from Mr. Hammond.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.139
I've got a nice play going on here.

13:26.223 --> 13:30.435
He pays me very handsomely
to authenticate his smuggled goods.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.771
I organize all his black-market auctions.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.399
And you forge the paperwork, too.
You were always quite gifted at that.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.567
But the fakes...

13:37.651 --> 13:40.153
I just sell the odd one or two
to bump up my margins.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.112
Classic con.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.280
A classic.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.199
One of the first we learned.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.909
It's boutique, though.

13:45.992 --> 13:51.706
Why don't you scale it up a bit?
Hmm? He could be a big score.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.377
He could be a massive score.

13:56.545 --> 14:00.882
Hammond keeps a whole shipping container
full of antiquities hidden at the docks.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.010
Just the choice pieces
that fell off the back of his barge

14:04.094 --> 14:06.137
while being smuggled to their buyers.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.557
-A hidden container.
-Uh-huh.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.142
But I've learned my lesson
about aiming too high.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.020
I never did have your sense of grandeur.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.691
I want to help you.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.902
What if I could get us both what we want?

14:20.986 --> 14:24.114
What I wanted was for you to be dead.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.492
But I'll settle for you
staying out of my way,

14:27.576 --> 14:29.119
Your Grace.

14:30.579 --> 14:34.708
Ah! What a delight!
Such a charming woman.

14:36.585 --> 14:39.129
I'm not saying work with Arthur.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.673
I'm just saying we...
we work around him.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.883
So we just pay him off?
You know him.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.260
He's in bed with the mark.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.219
Exactly.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.138
And that relationship is how we know

14:48.221 --> 14:50.640
that Hammond doesn't just have
his office collection,

14:50.724 --> 14:54.102
but is, in fact, hiding a container
full of black-market art.

14:54.185 --> 14:59.065
Arthur served us up a better,
bigger score. Let's return the favor.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.233
It's cleaner and smarter
to make him disappear.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.194
Bonk him on the head, have Breanna
wipe his ID and credit rating,

15:03.278 --> 15:04.154
and dump him in Venezuela?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.280
I'm so proud of you right now.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.366
So who is this Wilde guy?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.996
Arthur Wilde is an expert forger.

15:13.079 --> 15:17.250
I mean, his antiquities are good,
but his paperwork's flawless.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.209
He's an absolute master of--

15:18.293 --> 15:19.961
Sophie, that's not what she's asking you.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.255
She's asking you,
who is Wilde to you?

15:23.506 --> 15:26.509
All right? You took your comms out
during a job to talk to this guy.

15:27.344 --> 15:33.266
Everyone here has a past,
and everyone here respects that.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.187
Arthur, he's no one significant.
I will take care of him.

15:37.270 --> 15:42.192
Okay, well, I did that research on that
mahjong set of Hammonds, as requested.

15:42.275 --> 15:46.446
Yes, that is Hammond's prized possession.

15:46.529 --> 15:50.867
When I inspected it,
I thought it looked incomplete.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.495
[Breanna] Well, you're right.
It's missing the honor tiles.

15:53.578 --> 15:58.124
So 16 wind tiles in total,
plus three dragon tiles for each player.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.752
Now, for over a century, people believed
that the Empress Dowager's set

16:00.835 --> 16:03.004
was created without these extra tiles.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.006
But there is an Internet full of art nerds

16:05.090 --> 16:07.634
who believe the artisan
who made the extra tiles

16:07.717 --> 16:10.887
sneaked them away
after the Empress Dowager's death.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.014
I hacked Hammond's backup email.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.934
He's been putting out feelers everywhere,
searching for these missing tiles.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.060
You think we should find 'em for him?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.603
Yes.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.648
Can we fake antique ivory?

16:21.731 --> 16:24.734
I was hoping you would ask that.
Yes. It is called digital ivory.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.821
It's a calcium phosphate mixture
processed at high heat

16:27.904 --> 16:30.448
in a 3D printer,
used to make dental restorations.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.534
Ooh. I've never been to the dentist.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.576
I...

16:34.411 --> 16:35.829
All we got to do is steal a printer, then.

16:35.912 --> 16:39.666
We place some of your trackers
inside the tiles,

16:39.749 --> 16:44.045
we drop them into Hammond's auction,
we buy them out from under him,

16:44.129 --> 16:45.547
we hire him to smuggle them...

16:45.630 --> 16:48.258
Get him to steal
the thing that he wants the most,

16:48.341 --> 16:50.552
and then he'll take it back
to that little cave of wonders,

16:50.635 --> 16:53.221
we find that, and then we get him
for smuggling antiquities.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.265
And do we do that without Wilde?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.517
I'll handle him.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.270
Have you really never been to the dentist?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.646
I'm a master criminal.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.690
Can't have dental records flying around.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.025
[exhales sharply]

17:10.071 --> 17:11.906
[indistinct chatter]

17:19.247 --> 17:22.834
A lot of good stuff here, right?
I'm told the jade tiara is gorgeous.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.920
Did he say "made in China"?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.968
He said "jade tiara,"
not "made in China."

17:32.051 --> 17:34.179
I thought you said your lip-reading skills
were up to par on this.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.598
I'm practicing. Sheesh. Get a hobby.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.515
What?

17:37.599 --> 17:38.850
Hammond's on the move.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.312
[suspenseful music playing]

17:48.526 --> 17:50.987
What in the hell, man?!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.740
Me? You stepped in my way.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.994
You're too big of a man to apologize? Huh?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.121
Social graces means something around here.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.039
Anton.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.751
Mr. Hammond,
allow me to help our guest.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.504
I'm sure it's just one too many drinks.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.172
Please.

18:13.718 --> 18:18.389
It was a basic but decent distraction.
Sometimes that's all you need.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.724
She's taught you well.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.727
[chuckles]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:22.811 --> 18:26.022
However, I am happy to have
this conversation with you elsewhere.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.942
Oh, is the hitter gonna make mincemeat
of little old me?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.027
[sighs] I'll take it from here.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.821
Yeah, well, you better.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.781
Or I will.

18:37.992 --> 18:43.164
Your Grace, I distinctly recall saying
stay away from Hammond.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.216
[mischievous music playing]

18:58.680 --> 19:01.933
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
throw you off of Hammond's bay right now.

19:02.016 --> 19:05.103
Because I have a plan
that can get us both what we want.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.981
Sophie, you said you were gonna
handle this. Now you're looping him in?

19:08.064 --> 19:11.693
I'm not interested. I don't trust you.
Surely you understand.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.070
You help us find that hidden container
and bring Hammond down.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.572
Why would I do that?

19:16.614 --> 19:20.577
How many millions worth of art
is in that container?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.829
Your cut will make you ten times as much

19:22.912 --> 19:25.665
as you could make in years
selling the odd forgery.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.961
I was about to say,
"Don't make me regret this,"

19:30.044 --> 19:31.754
but considering our past,

19:31.838 --> 19:35.842
I don't think I could possibly regret
working with you more than last time.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.344
Fair enough.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.557
Unless I die.
I'm not gonna die this time, am I?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.559
No promises.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.651
Do you know who's selling these?

19:57.071 --> 20:01.159
Yes, Mr. Hammond,
a last-moment edition.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.996
But I had a feeling you'd take
a particular interest in these tiles.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.750
Wilde, you have outdone yourself.
Are these...

20:08.833 --> 20:09.918
Indeed, they are.

20:10.001 --> 20:13.212
Sent in by a wealthy client,
introduced to me by Dr. Baros.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.007
Our chance meeting
has proved quite profitable.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.216
And they're authentic?

20:17.300 --> 20:19.135
[Greek accent]
The provenance is indisputable.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.679
My client purchased
a small palace in Java.

20:21.763 --> 20:25.224
It had been used as a refuge
for those fleeing the early dynasties.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.645
These tiles were discovered
in the wine cellar.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.230
It hadn't been opened in a century.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.651
-If you don't believe...
-What?

20:38.488 --> 20:39.489
Excuse me one moment.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.749
[indistinct whispering]

20:54.420 --> 20:59.676
Mr. Akhmedova, the Chechen,

20:59.759 --> 21:04.472
has promised to exceed
our bid on the tiles by $200,000 US.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.225
That's quite an offer.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.060
Mr. Akhmedova.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.858
If you would like these items
shipped to a certain location,

21:15.942 --> 21:18.236
I'm sure Mr. Hammond
can accommodate.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.571
His vessels travel the world.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.618
[Chechen accent]
The Port of Tanjung Priok in Indonesia.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.454
As quickly as possible.

21:28.538 --> 21:31.833
We shall solidify the arrangements.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.724
"Pick up the item.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.309
Then, tomorrow,
bring it to my container."

21:50.393 --> 21:52.061
[no audible dialogue]

21:52.145 --> 21:54.230
He wants the tiles in Indiana.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.606
Indonesia.

21:55.690 --> 21:58.609
[no audible dialogue]

21:58.693 --> 22:02.071
"But they're not making it
anywhere near our demonstration."

22:02.155 --> 22:03.614
Their destination.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.241
[no audible dialogue]

22:05.324 --> 22:07.952
"Let's dump a few containers
into the gulf as we leave.

22:08.036 --> 22:11.080
We'll tell this Chechen
we were attacked by parrots."

22:11.164 --> 22:13.374
Yeah. No, pirates.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.043
It's obviously pirates!

22:17.754 --> 22:20.423
Okay, here we go.

22:23.718 --> 22:26.220
[suspenseful music playing]

22:46.407 --> 22:47.325
[beeping]

22:47.408 --> 22:51.079
Trackers working. Good signal.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.415
All right.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.086
[beeping]

22:58.169 --> 23:00.004
Well?

23:00.088 --> 23:01.923
The trackers are working,

23:02.006 --> 23:04.967
leading us straight
to Hammond's container.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.179
[beeping]

23:08.262 --> 23:09.097
Ooh.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.848
No, it's all good. It's all good.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.809
The metal containers cause interference.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.312
I use three signals, bounce them off
one another to boost visibility.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.398
[chimes]

23:19.482 --> 23:20.316
-Uh-oh.
-What was that?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.860
Okay, not good, not good, not good.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.904
Come on, come on.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.948
This container has active countermeasures.

23:27.031 --> 23:30.451
I can track a rough location,
maybe narrow it down to about...

23:30.535 --> 23:32.078
a hundred containers.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.539
Yeah, assuming none of them move
on or off the ship while we're looking.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.208
Damn it. Sophie, we got nothing.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.711
[beeping]

23:42.713 --> 23:44.507
We lost the signal.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.425
But you said this would work.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.346
Hammond's gonna find out
this whole thing's a fake.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.558
My entire con hangs in the balance here.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.268
And you knew this could happen?

23:56.602 --> 23:57.812
We're not done yet.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.947
The container's still there.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.576
It's still our best way to get him.
But for our new plan, we need Arthur.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.911
This has nothing to do
with the new plan, all right?

24:13.995 --> 24:16.080
This Wilde guy is not
just someone you used to know

24:16.164 --> 24:17.623
before when he was on the outside.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.333
If you wanna pretend that,
then that's fine,

24:19.417 --> 24:21.586
but he's on the inside now.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.713
Just like when it happened to me.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.423
Like when it happened to Parker.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.049
You gotta come clean.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.846
[ship horn blows]

24:31.929 --> 24:36.267
All right, we get on board,
locate Hammond's container and tag it.

24:36.350 --> 24:40.229
We'll be gone in no time.
Just try to act normal, okay?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.400
[Irish accent]
Top of the mornin' to ya laddies!

24:48.112 --> 24:49.864
[Sophie sighs]

24:54.869 --> 24:57.747
When I was starting out,
I teamed up with Arthur.

24:59.457 --> 25:05.463
We had a good thing going,
a couple of street rats in London.

25:07.173 --> 25:11.135
But then we joined a crew
doing art forgery.

25:11.219 --> 25:16.515
The boss was...
Well, he was brilliant but terrifying.

25:16.599 --> 25:21.646
He saw potential in me.
He set me up in high society.

25:21.729 --> 25:25.191
Suddenly, I was invited
to all the right parties.

25:25.274 --> 25:30.112
I was accepted in all the right homes,
trusted by all the right people.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.697
All right.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.866
So Wilde made the fakes,

25:33.950 --> 25:36.786
and you convinced
all your rich friends to buy 'em.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.537
How did Arthur
get the short end of the stick?

25:40.039 --> 25:44.418
A couple of years into the long con,
I caught the eye of an older man.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.671
The Duke of Hanover.

25:46.754 --> 25:51.050
Actually, he...
he was very kind to me,

25:51.133 --> 25:54.929
and I genuinely liked him.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.475
A duke. [exhales] It was a big score.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.978
And the boss encouraged me
to spend time with him

26:02.061 --> 26:04.021
and worm my way into the aristocracy.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.731
And then somebody figured you out?

26:05.815 --> 26:08.401
Mm-mm. Not me.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.735
One of the forgeries.

26:09.819 --> 26:14.949
The boss convinced me to let Arthur
take the fall, keep my identity clean.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.242
I--I...

26:16.325 --> 26:20.997
I could have said no.
I should have said no, but I didn't.

26:22.290 --> 26:26.711
I was young, and it was complicated.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.423
[sighs] So...

26:33.884 --> 26:36.095
Arthur I went to prison
because of me.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.140
Sophie, there's still nothing about
this guy that says we can trust him.

26:39.223 --> 26:43.644
We can still get what we want.
Arthur can do this, Eliot.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.814
I owe him this.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.444
I hope you're right
about this guy, Sophie.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.534
Well, you're not gonna get
any judgment from me.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.828
You remember where I was when we met.

27:00.911 --> 27:05.041
But if it comes down to helping
either your old partner or DeDe,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.584
which one you gonna choose?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.477
Tell me you're ready for this.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.355
Ah, I don't know.
I've been thinking about our new plan.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.107
My new plan. Oh, here it comes.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.568
It seems to rely quite heavily on me.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.987
In the next few moments in particular.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.490
So you thought now would be
a good time to renegotiate your cut?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.034
I don't wanna have to blow
the whole thing up over, what,

27:40.117 --> 27:42.745
say, an extra 25 on the dollar?

27:42.828 --> 27:43.704
Surely ten will do trick.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.206
Twenty was always my lucky number.

27:45.289 --> 27:49.126
Fifteen to wrap this up good and tight
before we reach that door.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.630
Always a pleasure
working with a professional.

27:52.713 --> 27:53.547
Hold on.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.802
That was a bit too easy.
What's really in this for you?

27:58.969 --> 28:00.805
It's none of your business.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.349
Oh, you don't trust me, Sophie Devereaux?

28:03.432 --> 28:06.477
Fair enough. You shouldn't.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.816
Wait, wait, wait.
I've seen this act before.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.026
You need to tell me exactly what you did.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.986
I don't need to tell you anything.

28:17.822 --> 28:20.324
He stole the honor tiles
for his personal collection.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.659
[Greek accent] What?

28:23.285 --> 28:25.454
You stole the honor tiles?

28:25.538 --> 28:28.207
Do you have any idea
who you stole those tiles from?

28:28.290 --> 28:30.209
Yeah, what's his name, the Chechen.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.627
[splutters]

28:31.710 --> 28:33.879
You don't know who the Chechen is?

28:33.963 --> 28:36.257
You didn't steal the tiles
from the Chechen.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.552
He overpaid for those tiles
by $200,000

28:39.635 --> 28:43.431
because he works for Adnan Altahir.

28:43.514 --> 28:44.723
The terrorist?

28:46.100 --> 28:49.186
Whose violent exploits in Southeast Asia
you should be familiar with.

28:49.270 --> 28:53.441
No, no, no, we have to fix this.
You have to give those tiles back.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.401
No, no, no, no, I'm not giving them back.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.777
They have no way
of knowing I was lying

28:56.861 --> 28:59.321
about the pirates
knocking the tiles overboard.

28:59.405 --> 29:04.577
And neither Altahir or the Chechen
are gonna do squat to me on US soil.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.956
Besides, I have a more immediate concern.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.041
This man was at the auction.

29:11.125 --> 29:14.962
You spoke with him,
and somehow he's also a dock worker.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.631
What's going on? Who is he?

29:17.715 --> 29:20.134
Uh... nobody?

29:20.217 --> 29:21.802
Now, that sounds like a lie.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.929
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
He's a...

29:24.889 --> 29:26.015
He's a fed.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.558
-Huh?
-Uh-huh.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.019
A fed? Are you kidding?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.896
You're in business with terrorists.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.106
You said you'd consult for me
if I had an opening?

29:34.190 --> 29:36.817
Well, I'm open to offers.

29:36.901 --> 29:37.902
Good to know.

29:37.985 --> 29:38.819
[cocks pistol]

29:38.903 --> 29:41.989
The guy's FBI, but he's bent.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.532
He's been working
in the art world for years.

29:43.616 --> 29:47.453
Whether he was at the auction for me,
the Chechen, or you, I don't know,

29:47.536 --> 29:50.498
but he can be bought.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.587
Well...

29:56.670 --> 29:58.797
I do like to acquire things.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.596
[upbeat music playing]

30:09.350 --> 30:10.351
[Irish accent] Mikey.

30:14.230 --> 30:17.650
[clears throat]
See you later for a pint there, Tommy.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.820
[whistles]

30:23.656 --> 30:25.032
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

30:26.700 --> 30:27.910
[sighs]

30:27.993 --> 30:29.703
How many more containers
are there to check?

30:29.787 --> 30:32.581
Sixty-three of these
in one shipment on one boat.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.042
No wonder DeDe's
fighting an uphill battle.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.126
Okay.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.179
I guess you know who I am.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.681
Well, I guess you know who I am.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.892
I know everything about you, Hammond.
I got mad respect for you.

30:51.976 --> 30:55.020
I've been trying to keep this case
off my boss's desk for weeks

30:55.104 --> 30:58.607
because I smell something
that could be great for both of us.

30:58.691 --> 30:59.900
Help yourself.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.405
We always find a way
to do just that, don't we?

31:04.488 --> 31:07.116
You've got a great scam going on here.

31:07.199 --> 31:10.411
All your little boats,
the trinkets you hide everywhere.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.413
I got a better scam.

31:12.496 --> 31:16.709
You see, Agent McSweeten,
head of the FBI counterterrorism,

31:16.792 --> 31:19.211
he's a little bit of a Boy Scout,
and he'd love to hear about you.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.879
-Oh, is that right?
-That is right.

31:20.963 --> 31:26.093
You see, you smuggle for big game,
but you're a little fish.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.803
He'd probably just use you for bait

31:27.886 --> 31:31.056
to catch whoever he wanted
to hang over his fireplace. [chuckles]

31:31.181 --> 31:35.060
And the only thing between you and him,
I guess, is me.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.186
I'll tear you apart!

31:36.270 --> 31:38.897
No, no, no, no, no.

31:39.732 --> 31:43.569
What you're gonna do
is cut me in for 40% of your operation.

31:43.652 --> 31:44.903
Now, that's what you're gonna do.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.573
Because if you don't,
the next time you see me,

31:47.656 --> 31:50.826
I could be with, like, 10, 12 cats
wearing windbreakers...

31:50.909 --> 31:51.744
[imitates racking shotgun]

31:51.827 --> 31:53.579
...holding shotguns.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.082
And I'd have a warrant in my hand.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.794
Pardon me. Enjoy. I wouldn't eat those.
Those were previously frozen.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.673
[door closes]

32:04.757 --> 32:07.551
This is all just getting too hot.

32:07.635 --> 32:11.305
Get the tiles from my container,
tell the barge to shove off and wait.

32:11.388 --> 32:12.514
International waters.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.557
I'm gonna call the Chechen.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.852
Maybe we can make a deal with the tiles
to solve this FBI blackmail.

32:16.935 --> 32:17.770
[banging on window]

32:17.853 --> 32:18.854
[imitates racking shotgun]

32:23.442 --> 32:25.944
Maybe he can take care
of all of our problems.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.030
[suspenseful music playing]

32:40.793 --> 32:43.671
[suspenseful music playing]

32:44.630 --> 32:45.464
How did you know, uh--

32:45.547 --> 32:47.466
Shh.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.261
[Chechen accent] Sit.

32:51.345 --> 32:56.058
I saw your barge pushing off
and knew we needed to talk.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.647
The man I work for is very powerful.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.774
Powerful enough
to solve all of your problems,

33:03.857 --> 33:06.777
legal or otherwise, anywhere in the world.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.655
Perhaps even take care
of a pesky FBI agent.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.074
[inhales sharply]

33:12.157 --> 33:16.537
In return, this most gracious leader
who appreciates cultural artifacts

33:16.620 --> 33:20.541
would be pleased to accept
your entire mahjong set.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.543
Lost tiles included.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.630
He wants the entire set now?

33:26.714 --> 33:29.049
Yes. Thank you.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.509
Very generous of you.

33:30.592 --> 33:34.930
I will escort this back
to my employer immediately.

33:36.098 --> 33:39.768
And so long
as you do not betray his trust...

33:41.562 --> 33:44.231
...there are no problems
we cannot erase for you.

33:44.314 --> 33:48.152
[suspenseful music playing]

33:48.235 --> 33:49.653
God damn!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.448
[phone rings]

33:56.285 --> 33:57.119
Yes.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.917
Everybody ready? Sophie?

34:04.001 --> 34:06.086
Heading in now.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.380
When we're done with him,
Hammond will have backed himself

34:08.464 --> 34:11.925
so far into a corner,
he'll turn himself over to the FBI.

34:12.009 --> 34:14.386
You do know Eliot's
not the real FBI, right?

34:14.470 --> 34:15.304
[Parker laughs]

34:15.387 --> 34:17.389
Why do you think I dropped
McSweeten's name in his lap?

34:17.473 --> 34:19.433
Sophie, be careful.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.019
[Sophie] So far, it's all going to plan,
thanks to Arthur.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.771
[door opens]

34:24.938 --> 34:29.568
Ms. Baros, my associate
just told me some troubling news.

34:29.651 --> 34:32.279
Apparently, your real name
is Sophie Devereaux

34:32.362 --> 34:36.700
and you're here trying
to con me out of everything I have.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.118
[suspenseful music playing]

34:45.751 --> 34:49.463
Did your associate also tell you that
he's been selling you fakes for months?

34:49.546 --> 34:51.673
I never sold him fakes.

34:51.757 --> 34:52.591
[Sophie] Really?

34:52.674 --> 34:57.429
The Malindi Kingdom was still active
in the early 1600s?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.640
I expect he's been taking kickbacks

34:59.723 --> 35:02.226
for authenticating other people's fakes
for you as well.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.062
Throwing out the blame
just to try and confuse things.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.939
That's just her style.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.441
She lured you into stealing
those lost tiles

35:09.525 --> 35:13.028
so you would lead her
directly to your personal container.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.156
Who told me about the hidden container
in the first place?

35:16.240 --> 35:17.366
Get the others. Now.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.205
I told you not to trust me.
You should have stayed in your lane,

35:23.288 --> 35:24.122
Your Grace.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.624
This is my lane.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.751
All this time and you've learned nothing.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.837
If you're so smart,
how did the trackers

35:29.920 --> 35:32.548
you hid in those lost tiles
work out of you, huh?

35:32.631 --> 35:34.508
Trackers? What trackers?

35:34.591 --> 35:36.468
I just found out about that. I swear.

35:36.552 --> 35:37.845
I just sent those tiles to--

35:37.928 --> 35:41.640
The Chechen just sent those to Altahir,
who's deep in hiding,

35:41.723 --> 35:43.267
'cause you said I needed to.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.561
And now you're telling me
there are trackers?

35:45.644 --> 35:47.354
He'll never believe
I didn't do this on purpose.

35:49.606 --> 35:53.777
Mr. Hammond. Mr. Hammond.
Mr. Hammond.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.195
-Shut up.
-Mr. Hammond.

35:55.279 --> 35:58.073
-I said shut up.
-About the Chechen...

35:58.156 --> 36:00.826
-Shut up or I'm gonna shoot you.
-[line ringing out]

36:00.909 --> 36:03.620
Come on, pick up. Come on, pick up.
Where is he?

36:03.704 --> 36:04.872
Look, I can fix this.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.748
But first we gotta get rid of her.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.377
Look, no matter how safe you believe
your hidden container is,

36:10.460 --> 36:12.713
she's about to empty it right now.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.006
[scoffs] Empty it?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.633
The container's on my ship,
safe and sound.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.385
But we're gonna fix this.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.429
We're gonna find
your little friend together.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.223
And if we can't,
I'm gonna get rid of you.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.308
-[grunts]
-Go.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.278
Where do you think you're going?

36:36.361 --> 36:38.864
Eliot, I could use your help
right about now.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.911
I got you. Go.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.082
[neck cracks]

36:49.166 --> 36:52.044
[grunting]

36:53.295 --> 36:56.381
[all grunting]

37:04.473 --> 37:05.849
[phone rings]

37:05.933 --> 37:09.102
-[static]
-Hello? Uh, Mr. Chechen? Hello?

37:09.186 --> 37:10.604
God damn interference. Hello?

37:10.687 --> 37:13.607
I told you, it's Sophie we need.
Forget the Chechen. He's--

37:13.690 --> 37:18.195
Another word out of you and I'll take care
of one of my big problems right now.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.280
[phone vibrates]

37:20.364 --> 37:23.158
Hammond keeps calling me
and I can't find Sophie.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.577
Breanna, where am I supposed to...

37:26.328 --> 37:27.162
Hold that thought.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.500
Trust me, no one's gonna miss
Sophie Devereaux when she's gone.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.961
I don't trust you, Wilde. Now move.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.755
[gasps]

37:36.838 --> 37:39.925
[Hammond]
What the...? But I've been call...

37:40.008 --> 37:41.009
[phone vibrating]

37:42.469 --> 37:44.179
[grunts]

37:44.262 --> 37:46.014
What did you do? What did you do?

37:46.098 --> 37:48.850
I don't know. He must have...
He was attacked.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.269
I've been calling him for the last ten.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.066
He's the only one
that could get me out of this mess.

37:56.149 --> 38:00.779
God damn it! What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

38:01.905 --> 38:04.616
-Huh?
-This is all too much, Mr. Hammond.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.619
Sophie Devereaux and the Chechen
and the FBI. It's a--

38:07.703 --> 38:12.207
The FBI? The FBI? I could call the FBI
and make a deal for protection.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.125
-Go.
-No.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.835
-Go!
-But no, no, no, no.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.503
You see, the FBI guy, he is--

38:16.586 --> 38:20.465
He's crooked, I know. But his boss,
McSweeten, he'll take my call.

38:20.549 --> 38:22.759
Oh, what? You're gonna make a deal
and save yourself?

38:22.843 --> 38:26.013
Hold on. What about Sophie Devereaux?
What about your container?

38:26.096 --> 38:28.765
You can't just let her
get away with everything!

38:28.849 --> 38:31.643
You're right. There is another way.

38:31.727 --> 38:35.105
But I'm gonna need a fall guy
for the FBI and the terrorist.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.898
[groans]

38:36.982 --> 38:40.027
After all, who was it
who met the Chechen first? You.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.863
Who was it who arranged
the sale of the tiles? You!

38:42.946 --> 38:44.823
No, no, no, Hammond!

38:44.906 --> 38:46.533
It's all a con.

38:46.616 --> 38:50.162
The FBI guy was in on it.
The Chechen was in on it.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.789
None of it is real!

38:52.873 --> 38:54.082
You don't need a fall guy.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.667
I don't believe a word you say.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.002
[groans]

38:59.629 --> 39:02.132
[suspenseful music playing]

39:03.050 --> 39:04.634
[engine starts]

39:24.905 --> 39:28.450
[panting] He's gone. We lost him.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.546
Which way did Hammond go now?

39:41.630 --> 39:44.341
He took a motorboat to his barge.
International water.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.844
So I did wind up dead this time.

39:49.346 --> 39:50.931
No one said he was gonna shoot me.

39:51.014 --> 39:54.684
Oh, Arthur. You didn't expect
we'd keep a live gun in play, did you?

39:54.768 --> 39:56.061
[grunts]

40:00.190 --> 40:02.484
[Chechen accent]
I have loaded the blanks into the gun.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.569
Now talk me through the rest.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.238
Just stop with the freaky accent thingy.

40:06.321 --> 40:10.617
Perhaps I will use this accent forever.
[evil laugh]

40:10.992 --> 40:12.536
[groans]

40:13.328 --> 40:15.080
Fall down, you idiot.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.958
You could have told me.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.876
We needed it to be believable.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.586
You were pushing the betrayal too hard.

40:21.670 --> 40:26.299
Excuse me, I stammered and cowered
perfectly well after Harry died.

40:26.383 --> 40:27.425
It was very convincing, by the way.

40:27.509 --> 40:30.303
Oh, that was actually
my first death, so...

40:31.096 --> 40:32.305
Hold that thought.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.558
[grunts]

40:37.018 --> 40:39.646
[grunting]

40:39.729 --> 40:40.772
Stop, stop, stop!

40:40.856 --> 40:42.107
[grunts]

40:43.608 --> 40:45.819
Is that enough blood?
Or should I add a little bit more?

40:45.902 --> 40:49.364
And when I crumple, should I crumple
forwards or should I crumple backwards?

40:49.447 --> 40:51.491
Well, just die already.

40:51.575 --> 40:52.951
Give me that.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.956
I'm gonna take Brando here home.

41:02.002 --> 41:06.381
But Hammond never called the FBI.
So much for your plan, huh?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.342
Arthur, plans are like identities.

41:09.426 --> 41:11.428
Always have a backup.

41:11.511 --> 41:12.345
Breanna.

41:12.429 --> 41:13.263
Oh, I'm on it.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.807
I reached out to all the media outlets
with your story

41:15.891 --> 41:18.185
and Parker's on the phone
with Hammond's satellite provider now.

41:18.268 --> 41:23.481
[Valley accent]
Yeah, tots. Yeah. Perf. Yeah. Cancel.

41:24.858 --> 41:28.528
[chuckles] Twenty minutes?
Oh, yeah. Totally. [laughs]

41:33.491 --> 41:34.743
[phone rings]

41:34.826 --> 41:35.660
Hello?

41:35.744 --> 41:38.830
I hope you enjoy your time
on your trash barge, Hammond.

41:38.914 --> 41:40.373
Don't you get it?

41:40.457 --> 41:42.918
All we needed was for you
to get on that barge,

41:43.001 --> 41:45.462
and now you're never getting off it.

41:45.545 --> 41:48.506
I can get off this ship
at a dozen international ports,

41:48.590 --> 41:52.552
bribe my way in through contacts
of any country that I have dumped in.

41:52.636 --> 41:56.306
I still have assets on this barge
worth millions of dollars.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.183
I'm afraid not, Mr. Hammond.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.352
Because what the government won't take,

42:00.435 --> 42:02.312
I've already stolen.

42:02.395 --> 42:04.272
[Breanna] Now we're almost into
Hammond's bank accounts.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.650
Just move the little arrow thingy

42:06.733 --> 42:09.694
to the little gray box thingy
on the right.

42:09.778 --> 42:11.655
[Chechen accent]
Yes, I know what a cursor is.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.865
This accent thing is throwing me off.

42:13.949 --> 42:15.742
[Harry] Perhaps you are seasick
from being on boat.

42:15.825 --> 42:16.660
Harry!

42:16.743 --> 42:17.744
[computer trilling]

42:18.828 --> 42:20.497
[Hammond] Oh, I'm gonna find you,
Sophie Devereaux.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.414
Ooh.

42:21.498 --> 42:24.125
You think you have me cornered? Yeah?

42:24.209 --> 42:27.796
Well, I still have an entire container
full of priceless antiquities.

42:27.879 --> 42:32.592
Which despite all of your crap,
you never managed to get.

42:40.892 --> 42:44.145
Get the tiles from my container,
tell the barge to shove off and wait.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.272
International waters.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.318
[Parker]
There's Hammond's guy.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.113
And that's the container.

42:53.196 --> 42:56.533
Hurry. Switch the ID numbers
so they take the wrong one.

43:22.350 --> 43:25.979
You see, the feds just don't
take one's word on this sort of thing.

43:26.062 --> 43:28.023
I did have to provide evidence.

43:28.189 --> 43:31.276
And don't even think
about trying to call for help.

43:31.359 --> 43:36.948
Your satellite phone
should start dying right about...

43:37.032 --> 43:38.408
[static]

43:38.491 --> 43:41.286
Hello? Hello?

43:41.369 --> 43:42.370
Hello?!

43:44.622 --> 43:47.250
[screams]

43:58.845 --> 44:01.765
We may not get 'em to stop
dumping trash around the world,

44:01.848 --> 44:04.392
but we sure managed to convince
Clyde Hammond to stop.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.394
Yeah, and replace your boat.

44:06.478 --> 44:10.065
And he graciously agreed
to put almost every cent he owns

44:10.148 --> 44:12.359
into a cooperative
to clean up the bay.

44:12.442 --> 44:16.237
You know, most people who don't
live with this problem refuse to care.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.615
I didn't think anybody would ever help.

44:18.698 --> 44:22.160
Well, I called the news station
about that follow-up.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.329
I think you could make them care.

44:25.163 --> 44:25.997
Come on.

44:28.375 --> 44:29.501
Stop.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.503
I wanna drive the boat.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.672
-I wanna drive the boat.
-[Eliot] No.

44:34.756 --> 44:35.965
-[Parker] I wanna drive the boat.
-[Eliot] No!

44:36.049 --> 44:37.175
[sighs]

44:39.677 --> 44:40.762
I'm gonna drive the boat.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.764
[indistinct chatter]

44:42.847 --> 44:46.643
-Arthur.
-Oh, apology time.

44:48.395 --> 44:51.606
Arthur, I admit
I tried to forget what I did

44:51.689 --> 44:55.026
or didn't do all those years ago.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.905
But I have been
carrying it with me ever since.

44:58.988 --> 45:02.367
I know your cut of the Hammond con
isn't gonna begin to make up for it.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.661
Where did the rest of the money go?

45:04.744 --> 45:06.204
I'm trying to make amends.

45:07.372 --> 45:09.040
That doesn't sound like the girl I know.

45:09.124 --> 45:11.209
That's not me anymore.

45:12.210 --> 45:13.336
Yes, it is.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.173
Just because you walked away
from the carnage in your past

45:17.257 --> 45:19.384
doesn't mean it's not there.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.512
And I'm not the only one whose legs
you cut out from underneath them.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.931
Why don't you stop pretending?

45:25.014 --> 45:27.517
'Cause I know the real you, darling.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.395
And you haven't changed.

45:39.529 --> 45:43.408
Harry, I wanted to thank you
for what you did on this con.

45:43.491 --> 45:44.617
I knew I did a good death.

45:44.701 --> 45:45.535
[both chuckle]

45:45.618 --> 45:46.995
I know that's not what you meant.

45:47.078 --> 45:50.707
You know, when Nate was running the team,

45:50.790 --> 45:54.252
he would never, ever admit
to having a blind spot.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.838
But I knew he relied on me
to point them out

45:56.921 --> 45:59.883
when he was veering
onto the wrong path.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.677
I know I have blind spots
and I know where they are,

46:02.760 --> 46:05.597
but thank you for pointing them out.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.309
I was kind of hoping
you might stick around for a bit,

46:09.392 --> 46:11.978
stop me from veering.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.947
You were right.

46:23.031 --> 46:25.241
I mean, maybe we can't take on
the world's bigger problems,

46:25.325 --> 46:26.868
but at least now DeDe can.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.536
I'm glad you found a way.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.580
Yeah.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.165
Uh...

46:32.248 --> 46:34.459
Why didn't you tell the crew about Arthur?

46:36.503 --> 46:40.381
Because you can't dwell on the past.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.925
You have to keep moving forward.

46:42.008 --> 46:45.887
But sometimes when you look back,
you see how much you've changed.

46:48.014 --> 46:49.891
Baby steps, Sophie.

46:51.392 --> 46:52.644
Baby steps.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.985
[theme music playing]
