inept circus freaks.

[Cliff] Who died
and made you team leader?

00:29.300 --> 00:31.001
[Rita] <i>We're not heroes.</i>

00:31.035 --> 00:33.036
We're the ones
who don't do anything.

00:33.070 --> 00:34.271
[Vic] You're a chickenshit.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.740
You're right.
I am afraid to look for Niles.

00:42.447 --> 00:45.115
I had everything,

03:05.889 --> 03:09.126
In the beginning,
there was the light.

03:09.159 --> 03:12.128

You're not here to save the world, son.
You're here to end it.

04:48.625 --> 04:51.460
the Cult of the Unwritten
Book was active again.

04:51.461 --> 04:53.598
Feels different this time.

Like the bastards might have
actually pulled it off.

I told you not to talk to me.

08:07.826 --> 08:11.127
And I hear you. But, can you at least
tell me why Jane was in my room?

08:11.161 --> 08:13.098
That wasn't Jane.

08:13.130 --> 08:16.000
[Hammerhead]
Jane's taking a time out.

08:16.033 --> 08:19.771
That was Baby Doll and she fucked up, too.
That's why I'm here.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.738
Did I do something wrong?

08:21.773 --> 08:25.543
- Ya think?
- What? What did I do?

08:25.576 --> 08:26.744

What about Paraguay?

You figure it out.

08:33.850 --> 08:35.152
Huh?

08:35.153 --> 08:37.787
Just to get us up to date on the
Chief's possible whereabouts,

08:37.788 --> 08:41.024
there are 37 known dimensions
in the universe.

08:41.058 --> 08:43.094
As you can see,
I've mapped them.

08:43.128 --> 08:47.931
Our challenge as a team,
is to pinpoint...

08:47.932 --> 08:50.667
- [Vic] Yes?
- We're not a team.

08:50.668 --> 08:53.071
You keep saying we're a team.
We're not a team.

08:53.104 --> 08:56.774
You wanna find the Chief, don't you?
I know I do.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.875
Larry? Cliff? What about you?

08:58.909 --> 09:01.645
Do you wanna find the Chief?

09:01.678 --> 09:03.447
[Larry and Cliff] Sure.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.682
[Vic] See?

09:04.715 --> 09:06.317
A group of people...

09:06.350 --> 09:07.518
A common goal.

09:07.551 --> 09:09.051
Looks like a team to me.

09:09.052 --> 09:10.520
Yeah...

09:10.553 --> 09:13.658
- Where's Rita?
- I'm right here.

09:13.691 --> 09:16.461
I guess my invite
got stuck at Western Union

09:16.495 --> 09:21.495
or is this what passes
as a cold shoulder nowadays?

09:21.565 --> 09:23.000
Neither.

09:23.001 --> 09:26.171
It's a meeting about where we
stand in search for the Chief.

09:26.203 --> 09:28.538
Apparently,
there's 37 dimensions.

09:28.572 --> 09:29.974
I see that, yes.

09:29.975 --> 09:31.841
[Vic] Rita, you're welcome
to sit in if you want,

09:31.842 --> 09:34.511
but I just figured,
given our conversation,

09:34.544 --> 09:37.048
you'd probably wanna
sit this one out.

09:37.081 --> 09:40.018
You know,
not being into it and all.

09:40.051 --> 09:45.051
But I'm sure we can think of
something for you to do if you want.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.426
Where was I?

09:48.460 --> 09:50.070
[Vic] If we look at the fundamentals...
[Hammerhead] Jesus, fuck.

09:50.094 --> 09:53.063
[Vic] ...at the subatomic level
and the atomic level...

09:53.096 --> 09:54.831
Thanks for standing up
for a gal, Larry.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.936
Remind me never to
count on you for anything.

09:57.969 --> 10:00.105
Not in the mood, Rita.
Not today.

10:00.138 --> 10:02.307
Of course not.
You're on his side.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.842
[Larry] Oh, right. You want me to
pretend Vic was lying about you.

10:05.876 --> 10:08.113
Just try supporting me
for once.

10:08.145 --> 10:10.715
Jane has Cliff.
Who do I get?

10:10.748 --> 10:13.017
You think I have a choice?

10:13.051 --> 10:15.787
This thing inside me
wants to be involved.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.589
- Just...
- [Kipling] Caulder!

10:18.623 --> 10:20.758
[whispers] Who is that?

10:20.792 --> 10:24.595
[Kipling] Caulder!
You old cunt.

10:24.629 --> 10:26.398
Where the hell are you?

10:26.431 --> 10:29.299
[Kipling] The Cult of the
Unwritten Book's on the march.

10:29.332 --> 10:31.469
Excuse me, sir.

10:31.501 --> 10:34.572
- Caulder!
- Sir!

10:34.605 --> 10:37.707
[Larry] Niles Caulder
isn't here.

10:37.741 --> 10:39.375
Where the hell is he?

10:39.409 --> 10:41.111
We don't know where he is,

10:41.145 --> 10:42.846
or for that matter,
when he'll be back.

10:42.847 --> 10:47.451
But, if you'd like to leave a message,
maybe tell us who you are...

10:47.485 --> 10:49.988
A message? Sure.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.923
How's this?
"Dear, Caulder, you wanker,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.892
I need my penny you nicked.

10:54.926 --> 10:57.528
'Cause the world's about to
fucking end. Again."

10:57.561 --> 10:59.764
Signed, "Your old pal, Kip."

10:59.797 --> 11:01.932
That's your name? Kip?

11:01.966 --> 11:04.735
Name's Kipling.
Willoughby Kipling.

11:04.769 --> 11:07.004
Knights Templar,
in case you're wondering.

11:07.038 --> 11:09.707
Don't suppose that means
anything to either of you.

11:09.740 --> 11:14.740
I'm very big in the world of,
shall we say, international strangeness.

11:14.879 --> 11:17.315
So go ahead.
Check me out.

11:17.349 --> 11:21.250
In the meantime,
I'll be in that bag of goat shit's office.

11:21.284 --> 11:23.835
Saving the world.

11:33.498 --> 11:38.301
So Caulder never told any of you freaks
about the Cult of the Unwritten Book?

11:38.302 --> 11:39.736
The who of the what?

11:39.769 --> 11:41.671
What's the Cult
of the Unwritten Book?

11:41.672 --> 11:43.875
Goddamn nightmare,
for starters.

11:43.908 --> 11:46.778
They're hellbent on bringing out
the destruction of the world.

11:46.812 --> 11:51.280
The Book, which they believe to be the
word of God, is being written as we speak.

11:51.315 --> 11:53.616
Once it's completed,

11:53.618 --> 11:55.220
the Cult will attempt
to read it.

11:55.253 --> 11:58.254
If successful,
the Eye will be summoned.

11:58.288 --> 11:59.923
The Decreator.

11:59.956 --> 12:03.293
And the world will be unmade.

12:03.326 --> 12:04.761
Who is this guy?

12:04.794 --> 12:06.429
Is he someone's uncle?

12:06.462 --> 12:08.365
[Kipling] There you are.

12:08.399 --> 12:12.403
The Little Sisters of our Lady of the
Razor paid me a visit this morning.

12:12.436 --> 12:13.537
Nuns.

12:13.571 --> 12:16.373
A straight razor in each hand.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.109
Cut through walls.

12:18.142 --> 12:21.044
Doesn't take a rocket scientist
to know it's a sign.

12:21.078 --> 12:23.480
Book is close
to being finished.

12:23.514 --> 12:26.549
- [glass shatters]
- Oh...

12:26.583 --> 12:28.251
Hmm.

12:28.284 --> 12:29.720
So...

12:29.754 --> 12:31.989
We need to find the Book...

12:32.023 --> 12:33.624
before the Cult finds him.

12:33.657 --> 12:35.192
Wait. What do you mean "him"?

12:35.225 --> 12:38.629
- Yeah. The Book's a person.
- [Rita] That makes no sense.

12:38.662 --> 12:41.432
[Larry] And where's this Book?

12:41.465 --> 12:42.799
Baphomet will tell us.

12:42.832 --> 12:45.501
[Cliff] Who?

12:45.535 --> 12:49.072
The Oracle. She's coming.

12:49.106 --> 12:53.210
[Cliff] Is anything
gonna make sense today?

12:53.243 --> 12:58.014

I say fuck that limey and the

13:46.529 --> 13:47.498
[Cliff] She's not wrong.

13:47.499 --> 13:49.267
Some Mr. Bean guy comes in
off the street

13:49.268 --> 13:50.811
and we abandon
the search for the Chief?

13:50.835 --> 13:53.504
Exactly. We're not superheroes.

13:53.538 --> 13:55.806
No one's forcing you
to be a part of this.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.408
We know where you stand.

13:57.442 --> 13:59.476
[Larry]
Does his story check out?

13:59.510 --> 14:02.113
Ish. He is a member
of the Knights Templar.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.849
And an established
Chaos Magician,

14:03.881 --> 14:07.217
which explains some of the
weird stuff we've seen so far.

14:07.251 --> 14:09.922
But there are a few gaps in his past.
And some shadows.

14:09.955 --> 14:14.592
And we're supposed to just believe drunk David
Copperfield that the world's gonna end?

14:14.625 --> 14:17.095
[Larry] I don't know
if I trust Kipling,

14:17.128 --> 14:21.477
but I believe the horse head.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.370
Keep chatting.
Take your time.

14:26.403 --> 14:28.839
It's not as though
we're trying to...

14:28.840 --> 14:33.673
halt the apocalypse
or anything.

14:34.677 --> 14:38.581
You believe a blue horse head.

14:38.615 --> 14:40.250
I do.

14:40.284 --> 14:45.284
I just don't understand
anything anymore.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.999
We're in.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.594
Glad you could fit it
in your schedule.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.395
[blows]

14:52.428 --> 14:53.928
[sizzling]

14:59.837 --> 15:04.837
- What is that?
- [Kipling] What's it look like, metal tits?

15:05.009 --> 15:06.210
It's a door.

15:06.244 --> 15:09.147
Go through it
and you find the Book, Elliot.

15:09.179 --> 15:11.014
So you smoke
a couple of cancer sticks

15:11.048 --> 15:14.018
and suddenly you can
open a door to anywhere?

15:14.051 --> 15:15.986
You think that's tobacco?

15:16.019 --> 15:17.721
[chuckles]

15:17.754 --> 15:19.490
Fuck it. Let's party.

15:19.523 --> 15:21.472
[Cliff] Wait!

15:25.330 --> 15:28.629
[sighs in frustration]

15:31.400 --> 15:33.037
[spits]

15:33.070 --> 15:35.972
Ugh. What on earth was that?

15:36.006 --> 15:39.110
Two grams
of Michelangelo's ashes.

15:39.143 --> 15:41.245
You are not well.

15:41.278 --> 15:43.047
[Cliff] Close the portal.
Close the portal.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.615
Close the portal!

15:44.649 --> 15:47.484
- You give me back my Book.
- Fuck off, shitbird!

15:47.518 --> 15:50.020
[Martha grunts]

15:50.053 --> 15:53.724
[sizzling]

15:53.756 --> 15:56.826
[all sigh]

15:56.860 --> 15:58.062
[grunts]

15:58.095 --> 15:59.763
Dear God.

15:59.797 --> 16:01.331
Let go of me.

16:01.365 --> 16:02.933
It's a cloaking spell.

16:02.967 --> 16:06.203
Hides him from the Cult.
Buys us time to complete the job.

16:06.236 --> 16:08.538
[Cliff] We saved the kid.
What else is there?

16:08.572 --> 16:10.140
Now we kill him.

16:10.173 --> 16:12.274
- And burn him.
- No way. Not happening.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.653
- [Cliff] No!
- We do not kill kids.

16:13.677 --> 16:15.679
Or burn books. He's both.

16:15.714 --> 16:19.850
Folks, now is not the time
to start throwing spanners.

16:19.884 --> 16:21.219
If he gets read,

16:21.251 --> 16:22.486
it's Katy bar the bloody door.

16:22.488 --> 16:23.821
Then we stop him
from being read.

16:23.822 --> 16:25.932
- There has to be another way.
- [Kipling] Yeah, sure.

16:25.956 --> 16:29.494
It's easy. All we have to do is
close the bloody Gates to Nurnheim.

16:29.527 --> 16:31.629
And after that
we can cure cancer.

16:31.663 --> 16:33.865
[Cliff] What the hell
is Nurnheim?

16:33.899 --> 16:37.434
Nurnheim is the ghost of a
city destroyed centuries ago.

16:37.469 --> 16:40.337
Cult was trying to read him,
that's where they come from.

16:40.370 --> 16:43.474
Okay. So we close the Gate.
How hard could it be?

16:43.506 --> 16:44.775
The Gates...

16:44.809 --> 16:47.946
are not Gates. It's a stigmata
on a person on their hands.

16:47.980 --> 16:52.317
And as the Gates open,
more assassins are unleashed.

16:52.350 --> 16:53.618
[Larry] Assassins?

16:53.652 --> 16:56.520
Yeah, and I don't mean MILFs
with cleavers. Look...

16:56.553 --> 16:59.857
The only way to
close the Gates

16:59.890 --> 17:03.894
is to find the person with the
stigmata and sew the wound shut.

17:03.927 --> 17:08.098
Any of you know how to sew?

17:08.132 --> 17:11.435
Wow. Suddenly I'm useful.

17:11.469 --> 17:14.338
To fight assassins. Of course.

17:14.372 --> 17:18.608
[Hammerhead] I can knit.

17:18.642 --> 17:20.592
I knit, okay?

17:26.017 --> 17:27.352
Dental floss?

17:27.384 --> 17:29.520
Janis Joplin's dental floss.

17:29.554 --> 17:31.556
The strongest known
spiritual thread in the world,

17:31.588 --> 17:34.858
the only thing powerful
enough to sew the Gates shut.

17:34.892 --> 17:37.161
Now, listen closely.

17:37.194 --> 17:39.864
Don't be idiots.
Don't fart around.

17:39.896 --> 17:43.500
Just close the Gates.

17:43.535 --> 17:45.303
I'm going with Hammerhead.

17:45.336 --> 17:47.171
This place will be
crawling with assassins.

17:47.204 --> 17:48.673
I should go.

17:48.707 --> 17:52.275
Okay, except,
I'm going with Hammerhead.

17:52.276 --> 17:53.609
Okay.
Cliff goes with Hammerhead.

17:53.611 --> 17:56.047
The rest of us will stay here
and protect the kid.

17:56.079 --> 17:58.883
Exactly where are these Gates?

17:58.915 --> 18:00.451
[Kipling] Good question.

18:00.484 --> 18:02.987
This will tell us where.

18:03.019 --> 18:05.189
Fuck it all. My last piece.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.424
- Chewing gum?
- "Knowing gum."

18:07.458 --> 18:11.562
It'll give me the answer.

18:11.563 --> 18:16.596
Where can we find
the Gates of Nurnheim?

18:21.571 --> 18:22.972
[gulps]

18:23.007 --> 18:25.076
[Larry] He swallowed it.

18:25.078 --> 18:26.442
Was that on purpose?

18:26.443 --> 18:31.182
That never digests, you know.
It's in there forever now.

18:31.214 --> 18:35.652
Got it.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.488
[goats bleat]

18:37.521 --> 18:39.089
[Cliff] Thank you, Flit.

18:39.123 --> 18:40.825
Okay, Hammerhead.

18:40.858 --> 18:44.194
Before the world ends, you mind telling
me what put me on your shit list?

18:44.228 --> 18:46.364
And what the hell
Paraguay means?

18:46.396 --> 18:47.798
[grunts] Fuck!

18:47.832 --> 18:51.701
- [Cliff] What?
- If I tell you, will you leave me alone?

18:51.734 --> 18:53.237
Sure.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.971
Paraguay was an eye-opener.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.642
All that carnage, the blood.

18:57.674 --> 19:01.278
You had Jane conned pretty
good, but I know better.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.448
Cliff,
you're a fucking monster.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.384
You're just another bundle
of toxic masculinity.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.787
Wow! That's rich

19:08.819 --> 19:12.155
coming from someone who calls
themself "Hammerhead."

19:12.189 --> 19:13.758
I've seen you in action.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.294
You're every bit
as aggressive as I am.

19:16.326 --> 19:20.896
The difference is I exist
for a reason.

19:20.897 --> 19:22.900
What the fuck is your excuse?

19:22.932 --> 19:24.432
[stammers]

19:34.778 --> 19:38.682
We need to be prepared in case
they can't close the Gates.

19:38.715 --> 19:40.417
Or the magic cloaking
doesn't work.

19:40.451 --> 19:43.287
This was never just about
relying on your magic.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.390
We're prepared to fight.

19:45.423 --> 19:49.759
I'll secure the perimeter and make
sure everything is locked up tight.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.229
Larry...

19:51.262 --> 19:54.897
Can you stay close to the kid in
case anything gets through us?

19:54.932 --> 19:57.768
[Larry] Sure.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.738
I need hot sauce.

19:59.770 --> 20:04.770
[Larry]
Check the fridge upstairs.

20:04.808 --> 20:07.011
You think Larry
is different from me?

20:07.045 --> 20:10.448
He'll be the first to tell you
he's no hero. None of us are.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.782
I don't see it that way.

20:11.816 --> 20:14.786
You can't make us
into something we're not, Vic.

20:14.818 --> 20:16.295
No matter how much
you have to prove...

20:16.319 --> 20:18.153
I'm not here to prove anything.

20:18.154 --> 20:19.557
Bullshit.

20:19.590 --> 20:22.125
[sighs] You know what?
Maybe you're right.

20:22.159 --> 20:26.663
Maybe Larry's not a hero.

20:26.698 --> 20:30.968
But that thing inside him is.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.601
It might also be insane.

20:47.684 --> 20:51.890
Look at this fucking place.

[Cliff] Hello?

21:03.401 --> 21:07.305
[praying continues]

21:07.337 --> 21:10.407
How many lives
were wrecked here, you think?

21:10.441 --> 21:12.108
In the shadows?

21:12.143 --> 21:14.579
[Cliff] Um...

21:14.613 --> 21:19.613
I'm a little too busy in my own slasher
flick here to get into all that now.

21:23.821 --> 21:27.491
[Cliff] Hello?
Who's in there?

21:27.525 --> 21:29.027
[exclaiming]

21:29.059 --> 21:32.061
Hey. Easy. Whoa, whoa, padre.
We're here to help stitch you up.

21:32.096 --> 21:33.832
<i>Me llamo</i> Cliff.

21:33.865 --> 21:35.898

the Spanish I got.

21:35.932 --> 21:38.269
[pleading in Spanish]

21:38.301 --> 21:42.539
Right.
Let's keep it short and sweet.

21:42.573 --> 21:45.308
All right.
Hammerhead, you ready?

21:45.343 --> 21:46.778
Hammerhead?

21:46.810 --> 21:51.714
Hammerhead, help me close this
guy's stupid hand gate things!

21:51.748 --> 21:55.685
Right.

21:55.719 --> 21:56.988
Here.

21:57.021 --> 21:59.223
- Let me help you, motherfucker!
- [Cliff] Whoa, whoa.

21:59.257 --> 22:01.792
Just like you helped all those
people who trusted you!

are you doing...

what happened to you,

22:07.163 --> 22:09.833
but this isn't about that.

22:09.866 --> 22:12.202
Fuck you!

22:22.913 --> 22:25.082
Oh, shit.

22:25.115 --> 22:27.484
Is this Nurnheim?

22:27.518 --> 22:32.323
Are we in goddamn Nurnheim?

22:32.355 --> 22:33.624
This isn't snow.

22:33.657 --> 22:36.060
You really shit the bed
on this one, didn't you?

22:36.094 --> 22:39.396
That fucknut magician
gave us one job.

22:39.430 --> 22:41.900
To stop the end of the world.
But, no...

22:41.932 --> 22:45.869
You had to kick the Gate
wide open and drag me with you!

22:45.903 --> 22:49.440
- [in British accent] I'm sorry, sir.
- Wait. Which one are you?

22:49.472 --> 22:51.307

22:51.342 --> 22:53.143
Please don't hurt me, sir.

22:53.176 --> 22:54.478
Where's Hammerhead?

22:54.511 --> 22:55.980
I'm stuck in Nurnheim

22:56.013 --> 22:57.981
and I don't even get to
yell at Hammerhead?

22:58.016 --> 23:01.920
I'm sorry, sir.
Hammerhead has been relieved.

23:01.952 --> 23:06.123
The church was too
[stammers] provocative.

23:06.155 --> 23:09.626
God damn it!

23:09.660 --> 23:11.895
You feel like
we've seen this place before?

23:11.930 --> 23:14.330
[Penny Farthing]
No, sir. I'm sorry.

23:14.365 --> 23:16.500
Say you're sorry one more time.

23:16.534 --> 23:18.102
Interlopers!

23:18.134 --> 23:20.203
You have no business here.

23:20.237 --> 23:22.105
That is technically true.

23:22.138 --> 23:25.542
You will come with us.

23:25.576 --> 23:27.310
All right.
Penny, you ready to fight?

23:27.345 --> 23:28.694
Yes, sir.

23:32.549 --> 23:35.019
Seriously?

23:35.053 --> 23:37.922
Okay, you know
you fucked all the way up now.

23:37.955 --> 23:40.657
You're pissing me off
even more than she did.

23:40.692 --> 23:44.127
- [electric buzzing]

23:44.161 --> 23:46.411
Nurnheim sucks.

24:14.325 --> 24:16.875
[chanting spells]

24:35.512 --> 24:36.713
[Larry] What are you doing?

24:36.748 --> 24:38.383
Nothing guards a threshold

24:38.416 --> 24:43.416
like a rosary that's been enchanted
and spiced. And one on each door.

24:43.755 --> 24:46.056
If they can get through that,
grab the kid,

24:46.089 --> 24:47.458
well, fuck it all.

24:47.490 --> 24:49.861
World's meant to end.

24:49.894 --> 24:51.930
[Larry] That incantation...

24:51.962 --> 24:56.867
"Love Me Do."
Or a reasonable facsimile.

24:56.901 --> 24:59.938
"Hard Day's Night"
is much stronger, but...

24:59.971 --> 25:03.441
can never remember
the words.

25:03.473 --> 25:06.143
Don't question the magic.

25:06.144 --> 25:08.346
Worked well for us so far,
hasn't it?

25:08.380 --> 25:13.380
I'm sorry. You really think
this is gonna save me?

25:14.818 --> 25:17.186
[Kipling]
I've done all I can, boy.

25:17.221 --> 25:18.624
Let's be honest,

25:18.656 --> 25:22.626
I'm half pissed and the rest of you
lot are jarringly incompetent.

25:22.660 --> 25:27.609
But, uh, good luck
to us all, eh?

25:37.674 --> 25:39.810
[Kipling] We all locked up?

25:39.844 --> 25:42.079
As good as a rickety old
house can be.

25:42.113 --> 25:46.150
I'd be happier knowing that your
friends have got the Gates closed.

25:46.182 --> 25:50.654
Uh-huh.

25:50.688 --> 25:52.256
You stoned?

25:52.288 --> 25:54.090
Running a weapons inventory.

25:54.124 --> 25:56.259
Oh.

25:56.292 --> 25:58.796
Me too.

25:58.829 --> 26:03.500
Scotch. Check.
Vodka. Check. Bourbon. Check.

26:03.534 --> 26:06.337
Gin. Check.

26:06.371 --> 26:09.673
Are you sure you don't want a clear head
in case we have to throw down later?

26:09.707 --> 26:12.844
God, no.

26:12.876 --> 26:15.878
If we're fighting,
I wanna be properly rat-assed.

26:15.912 --> 26:19.182
No.

26:19.215 --> 26:21.818
So, what's your plan?

26:21.853 --> 26:23.954
You zap everything
that comes through that door?

26:23.988 --> 26:26.490
Zap?
Yeah, amongst other things.

26:26.523 --> 26:28.859
A lot of faith
to put in gadgets.

26:28.893 --> 26:31.462
The Book's not being hunted
by a pack of muggers.

26:31.496 --> 26:34.731
I'll take science over whatever it
is that you do any day of the week.

26:34.766 --> 26:37.269
Nobody's rooting
harder for you than I.

26:37.301 --> 26:41.373
But if your science and my whatever
it is that I do don't work...

26:41.405 --> 26:44.575
we're gonna have to
reexamine our options.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.075
Are you talking about
killing the kid?

26:46.076 --> 26:48.445
I'm talking about
destroying the Book.

26:48.479 --> 26:50.213
That Book has a name.

26:50.247 --> 26:51.650
Elliot.

26:51.682 --> 26:54.652
And there is no way I'm killing him.
Or anyone for that matter.

26:54.684 --> 26:55.819
'Cause you're a hero.

26:55.853 --> 26:57.521
[Vic] And what are you exactly?
Seriously?

26:57.556 --> 27:00.090
How the hell did Niles
ever get mixed up with you?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.326
The man that I've known
since I was six

27:02.359 --> 27:06.597
wouldn't even dream of
what you're suggesting.

27:06.632 --> 27:11.632
Sounds like you and I know
two different Niles Caulders.

27:12.170 --> 27:16.707
You and the rest
of those idiots

27:16.740 --> 27:18.343
have your "Chief."

27:18.375 --> 27:21.246
A kindly uncle, quick with a pat on
the back and some friendly advice.

27:21.278 --> 27:24.615
And you've got Niles,
the cold-blooded killer?

27:24.648 --> 27:26.383
I've got a man

27:26.384 --> 27:28.562
who'll make the decisions that have to
be made to keep the world spinning.

27:28.586 --> 27:33.324
A man who's willing to live with those
decisions and forever be haunted by them.

27:33.356 --> 27:35.660
It's okay.

27:35.692 --> 27:37.228
You're young.

27:37.261 --> 27:40.230
You can afford to
be a little stupid.

27:40.263 --> 27:42.732
If you're lucky,

27:42.767 --> 27:45.170
maybe you'll live
a little longer.

27:45.202 --> 27:48.972
Maybe they'll pack you
into a few dark corners.

27:49.007 --> 27:54.106
Then you may surprise yourself
what you're really capable of.

28:07.090 --> 28:09.626
[Larry] Maybe you shouldn't
have your phone on.

28:09.660 --> 28:14.397
Someone could track us.

28:14.431 --> 28:15.900
[whistles]

28:15.932 --> 28:18.134
That's a beauty.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.003
Yeah.

28:20.038 --> 28:22.073
Fixed it up together.

28:22.105 --> 28:26.044
All three of us.
Couple hours a day.

28:26.076 --> 28:29.413
We did everything together.

28:29.445 --> 28:30.647
[sighs]

28:30.681 --> 28:34.085
I'm sorry, Elliot.

28:34.117 --> 28:38.189
You know,
they were my only friends.

28:38.222 --> 28:43.222
I don't even know
if they loved me.

28:44.229 --> 28:47.431
They told me I had a destiny.

28:47.463 --> 28:49.298
I was gonna be a hero.

28:49.333 --> 28:52.869
Save the world.

28:52.903 --> 28:55.271
But this, I...

28:55.305 --> 28:56.707
I don't want this.

28:56.740 --> 28:59.242
I hate that word.

28:59.276 --> 29:01.612
"Hero."

29:01.644 --> 29:02.813
It's dangerous.

29:02.846 --> 29:05.115
A title
other people hang on you

29:05.148 --> 29:07.317
and you're supposed to
carry it around.

29:07.352 --> 29:11.087
But that's what
you all are, right?

29:11.121 --> 29:15.325
No.

29:15.326 --> 29:20.359
I tried being a hero once and
I destroyed everything I had.

29:21.299 --> 29:23.366
You're lucky.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.669
[scoffs] Lucky?

29:25.702 --> 29:26.914
You can't live
for other people.

29:26.938 --> 29:29.140
You have to
be true to yourself.

29:29.173 --> 29:30.474
You're learning that now.

29:30.508 --> 29:33.778
- [sighs]
- Took me a lifetime to figure that out.

29:33.810 --> 29:36.814
I don't have a lifetime.

29:36.815 --> 29:39.683
You heard Kipling.
The Cult's after me.

29:39.718 --> 29:41.595
They're gonna take me, they're
gonna read me and we die.

29:41.619 --> 29:43.921
- You don't know that.
- I should've just stayed at home.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.299
Let them read me,
get it over with.

29:45.323 --> 29:50.323
Don't say that, Elliot.
Try to have a little faith.

29:50.324 --> 29:52.497
Faith?

29:52.529 --> 29:56.500
I just saw my fucking mom slit my
dad's throat! Fuck your faith!

29:56.534 --> 29:57.902
I'm sorry.

29:57.934 --> 30:00.337
The whole world's gonna end
'cause of me.

30:00.372 --> 30:04.375
Maybe I should just take care of this
on my own. Just fucking kill myself.

30:04.407 --> 30:05.607
[grunts]

30:22.426 --> 30:24.730
[Niles on video] <i>John Bowers.
He was your mechanic.</i>

30:24.762 --> 30:28.365
[Larry] <i>Yes, I know who he is. I just
don't feel like talking about him.</i>

30:28.400 --> 30:31.603
<i>- And why is that?
- [Larry] Because it's pointless.</i>

30:31.635 --> 30:34.204
[Niles] <i>I don't think
you believe that.</i>

30:34.239 --> 30:36.673
[Larry] <i>How many times
do we have to go into my past?</i>

30:36.707 --> 30:38.675
- [gasps]
<i>- The people I know...</i>

30:38.709 --> 30:39.844
Oh, God.

30:39.876 --> 30:41.979
<i>...or knew
had nothing to do with this.</i>

30:42.012 --> 30:43.881
<i>This is the result
of catching a bad ride.</i>

30:43.914 --> 30:45.481
<i>Do you want the world to end?</i>

30:45.516 --> 30:47.184
<i>Is that it?</i>

30:47.218 --> 30:50.221
<i>You think that'll
get you out of me for good?</i>

30:50.255 --> 30:53.357
What in God's name do you want?

30:53.391 --> 30:55.460
<i>Why do you keep
prodding me like this?</i>

30:55.492 --> 30:59.663
<i>I don't have time
to play games with you.</i>

30:59.696 --> 31:01.133
[Niles] <i>There you are.</i>

31:01.165 --> 31:04.769
<i>Look, I know it's easier for you to
come out when he's under duress,</i>

31:04.801 --> 31:07.372
<i>but we really must
work on that.</i>

31:07.404 --> 31:12.404
<i>I have something to show you.</i>

31:14.279 --> 31:19.279
<i>Now, I know we've tried to communicate
in several ways with limited success.</i>

31:20.551 --> 31:23.354
<i>But I have a feeling
I have nailed it this time.</i>

31:23.387 --> 31:25.790
<i>This device
could be the answer.</i>

31:25.824 --> 31:29.394
<i>You are composed of an energy
yet to be discovered.</i>

31:29.426 --> 31:32.230
<i>This is designed to
convert energy</i>

31:32.262 --> 31:34.531
<i>into an audible frequency.</i>

31:34.566 --> 31:39.566
All I need is for you to enter
this machine so we may attempt

31:39.636 --> 31:42.073
to find your voice.

31:42.105 --> 31:43.707
<i>What do you say?</i>

31:43.740 --> 31:48.612
[turns on device]

31:48.645 --> 31:50.681
I only want to help you.

31:50.713 --> 31:54.718
Both of you.

31:54.751 --> 31:56.287
<i>Very good.</i>

31:56.320 --> 32:00.357
Now, I'm going to ask you
some simple questions

32:00.391 --> 32:05.128
and I want you to answer
through speech if you can.

32:05.163 --> 32:07.765
Do you have a name?

32:07.798 --> 32:09.633
[crackling and hissing]

32:09.666 --> 32:11.169
<i>Where do you come from?</i>

32:11.201 --> 32:13.003
<i>Where do you call home?</i>

32:13.037 --> 32:14.806
[crackling and hissing]

32:14.839 --> 32:18.575
<i>Do you remember coming into contact
with Captain Trainor's plane?</i>

32:18.608 --> 32:20.778
[crackling and hissing]

32:20.811 --> 32:24.315
How do you sustain yourself
in Captain Trainor's body?

32:24.348 --> 32:28.618
How do you live in there?

32:28.652 --> 32:31.021
[ghostly voice] <i>Torture.</i>

32:31.055 --> 32:32.556
[Niles] <i>How's that?</i>

32:32.588 --> 32:34.959
Torture? How?

32:34.991 --> 32:36.059
Physically?

32:36.093 --> 32:38.296
<i>No. Hold on.</i>

32:38.328 --> 32:40.030
<i>Let's keep going.</i>

32:40.064 --> 32:42.932
I have many more questions
I want to ask you.

32:42.967 --> 32:45.517
[device shatters]

32:53.010 --> 32:56.713
<i>How do you sustain yourself
in Captain Trainor's body?</i>

32:56.747 --> 32:59.217
<i>How do you live in there?</i>

32:59.250 --> 33:01.318
[ghostly voice] <i>Torture.</i>

33:01.352 --> 33:04.654
<i>How's that? Torture? How?</i>

33:04.688 --> 33:05.890
<i>Physically?</i>

33:05.923 --> 33:09.227
<i>No. Hold on.</i>

33:09.259 --> 33:10.961
<i>Let's keep going.</i>

33:10.994 --> 33:15.994
<i>I have many more questions
for you.</i>

33:16.433 --> 33:19.537
So Larry's a hero
all of a sudden and I'm out?

33:19.538 --> 33:21.672
That's how it's going to be,
you arrogant can opener?

33:21.673 --> 33:23.907
[mockingly] No one's forcing
you to be a part of this.

33:23.941 --> 33:25.575
We know where you stand.

33:25.576 --> 33:26.635
My eye.

33:26.636 --> 33:30.779
You idiots want to hold up here and wait for
something horrible to carve you to pieces?

33:30.780 --> 33:32.917
Be my guest.

33:32.951 --> 33:36.654
Elliot. Elliot. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:36.688 --> 33:38.990
Aren't you supposed to be
downstairs with Larry?

33:39.022 --> 33:41.759
[scoffs] Why? So I'll be safe?

33:41.791 --> 33:43.193
It's all pointless.

33:43.227 --> 33:46.163
I'm fighting destiny. Why?

33:46.196 --> 33:48.767
My life's destroyed anyway,
so...

33:48.799 --> 33:53.799
Decided I'd help everybody out
and just kill myself.

33:54.404 --> 33:56.941
Well, this is
only the second floor.

33:56.973 --> 33:58.808
You wouldn't kill yourself.

33:58.843 --> 34:01.946
Maybe break an arm or a leg.

34:01.980 --> 34:06.980
Plus, to be fair, you'd have to die and be
burned if you wanted to really save everyone.

34:07.817 --> 34:09.353
It doesn't matter.

34:09.387 --> 34:14.291
[scoffs] 'Cause I'm so weak,
I couldn't even try.

34:14.324 --> 34:15.992
I'm a failure.

34:16.027 --> 34:17.795
[chuckles]

34:17.829 --> 34:22.829
I'm a failure. And the whole
world's gonna pay for it.

34:23.900 --> 34:28.873
Hey, stop that.

34:28.905 --> 34:31.875
It's going to be okay.

34:31.876 --> 34:33.409
Come here.

34:53.597 --> 34:55.465
This world...

34:55.500 --> 34:58.135
is a beautiful,
horrible place.

34:58.168 --> 35:00.538
It's spectacular.

35:00.572 --> 35:05.572
You don't need the burden
of ending it.

35:09.646 --> 35:12.849
Maybe the people
in this house can't save you.

35:12.851 --> 35:15.519
We failed before.

35:15.552 --> 35:20.353
But can you at least
let us try?

35:36.773 --> 35:39.341
[gasps]

35:39.342 --> 35:40.577
Now what the hell?

35:40.610 --> 35:44.414
[Mother Archon]
Welcome, guests.

35:44.447 --> 35:47.184
[Cliff] Giant clowns? Nope.

35:47.217 --> 35:50.954
[Mother Archon] Run and the Hoodmen
will only gather you again.

35:50.987 --> 35:54.189
You may stay as our guests.

35:54.190 --> 35:55.190
I don't want to...

35:55.192 --> 35:57.094
[stuttering]

35:57.126 --> 36:00.797
be stung.
It looked like it hurt.

36:00.831 --> 36:03.367
[Cliff] So what the hell
are you supposed to be?

36:03.400 --> 36:06.001
[Mother Archon]
We are the Archons.

36:06.036 --> 36:08.137
The high priests of Nurnheim.

36:08.170 --> 36:10.306
[Cliff] Wait.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.708
I know you.

36:11.742 --> 36:14.244
You tried to steal
the Book from me.

36:14.277 --> 36:17.114
You're the boy's parents.

36:17.146 --> 36:20.318
We were,
but we have ascended.

36:20.351 --> 36:24.721
A reward for protecting the Unwritten
Book until its completion.

36:24.753 --> 36:27.257
This is your reward?

36:27.291 --> 36:29.726
[Mother Archon]
All of Nurnheim is ours.

36:29.760 --> 36:34.297
Dad's taking
a real victory lap.

36:34.331 --> 36:36.967
His suffering was brief.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.168
As will be our glory.

36:39.202 --> 36:42.405
Because soon
the Decreator will rise

36:42.438 --> 36:44.007
and set right to existence

36:44.041 --> 36:46.076
and then we,

36:46.108 --> 36:47.344
all of us,

36:47.378 --> 36:48.778
will cease to be.

36:48.813 --> 36:52.349
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not gonna happen.

36:52.382 --> 36:56.320
Because you are
going to stop us?

36:56.353 --> 36:59.891
[chuckles]
You're too late, guests.

36:59.923 --> 37:04.195
All of Nurnheim has gone to retrieve
and read the Unwritten Book.

37:04.228 --> 37:08.398
Good luck finding him. We put a spell
on him with weird spit and everything.

37:08.431 --> 37:10.501
He's invisible to you.

37:10.534 --> 37:13.769
You can't read
what you can't see.

37:13.802 --> 37:15.804
But you're wrong.

37:15.838 --> 37:20.010
We see everything.

37:20.043 --> 37:22.445
Gone! You let him go?

37:22.478 --> 37:23.847
What is wrong with you?

37:23.880 --> 37:26.382
- I trusted you.
- I didn't do anything. It was him.

37:26.416 --> 37:27.593
[Kipling] Who's him?
[Vic] Why would he do that?

37:27.617 --> 37:28.829
[Larry] Don't you get it?
[Kipling] Who's he?

37:28.853 --> 37:30.218
[Larry] He's just
as screwed up as me.

37:30.219 --> 37:31.453
You need to
pull yourself together.

37:31.454 --> 37:32.988
Nobody's gonna explain
anything to me, are they?

37:32.989 --> 37:36.793
Elliot is fine.
He's terrible, but he's fine.

37:36.827 --> 37:40.563
- [stammers] I thought you'd run off to...
- Kill myself?

37:40.597 --> 37:43.733
Yeah, I was, uh...
I was thinking about it.

37:43.768 --> 37:46.204
She talked me
into staying safe.

37:46.237 --> 37:51.074
I don't know why, but I thought
this horse's ass could save him.

37:51.108 --> 37:53.543
[pounding on door]

37:53.577 --> 37:56.280
Get the boy downstairs.
It's them.

37:56.313 --> 37:58.282
You're with me.
You take the hall.

37:58.315 --> 38:00.817
Make sure
nobody comes downstairs. Go!

38:00.849 --> 38:02.851
[pounding continues]

38:02.885 --> 38:04.987
Can I trust you?

38:05.021 --> 38:07.090
Can I trust it?

38:07.123 --> 38:09.358
It does love a fight.

38:09.393 --> 38:13.463
[pounding continues]

38:13.496 --> 38:16.532
Hurry. Hurry.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.735
- [beads crushing]
- [Rita gasps]

38:18.768 --> 38:20.871
Who in the world
put those there?

38:20.905 --> 38:23.249
Oh, uh, Willoughby did. They're magic.
They're supposed to protect the lab.

38:23.273 --> 38:24.541
He dipped them in Sriracha.

38:24.574 --> 38:29.574
Well, let's put them
back together again.

38:34.518 --> 38:38.568
Grid, activate sonic canon.

38:39.699 --> 38:41.958
Science.

38:41.992 --> 38:43.994
What's that for?

38:44.027 --> 38:47.327
[reciting incantation]

38:50.266 --> 38:51.268
Magic.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.269
[banging on door]

38:53.302 --> 38:54.938
That's it. They're in.

38:54.972 --> 38:57.507
- Dry bachelors. Of course.
- Dry bachelors?

38:57.541 --> 38:59.242
Assassins. Pain surgeons.

38:59.277 --> 39:04.277
Made out of dead skin and
letters that were never sent.

39:15.925 --> 39:17.226
[Larry] Anytime now.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.728
Whenever you're ready.

39:18.762 --> 39:20.762
Oh, come on.
Quit playing games.

39:20.797 --> 39:22.132
[grunts]

39:22.164 --> 39:24.067
Release, or whatever.

39:24.099 --> 39:27.099
[electrical buzzing]

39:39.483 --> 39:40.583
This isn't gonna work.

39:40.617 --> 39:42.786
It's fine. It's totally fine.

39:42.820 --> 39:45.056
- I don't wanna die.
- [Rita] And you won't.

39:45.088 --> 39:48.592
We're going to gather all the little
disgusting beads and keep you safe

39:48.625 --> 39:51.493
while the others fight
whatever it is out there.

39:51.494 --> 39:53.129
We're going to save the world
or whatever

39:53.130 --> 39:55.766
and then I will have a stiff
Manhattan and go to bed.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.701
[stammering]
I don't care about my destiny.

39:57.735 --> 40:00.871
I don't care about saving the world.
I just don't want to die.

40:00.905 --> 40:04.875
Listen, I was well on my way
out of here when you stopped me.

40:04.909 --> 40:08.012
And God knows why,
I actually did something good.

40:08.045 --> 40:12.583
I am being a good person and you are
absolutely ruing this moment for me.

40:12.615 --> 40:17.615
So shut up and pick up
the stupid beads!

40:21.190 --> 40:23.740
[swords clanging]

40:26.563 --> 40:28.931
Behind you!

40:28.965 --> 40:30.300
Nice science.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.983
Nice magic.

40:36.673 --> 40:39.275
What happened
to your arm gun thingy?

40:39.309 --> 40:40.976
Uses up too much juice.

40:41.010 --> 40:43.380
Besides...

40:43.413 --> 40:45.481
we don't need it.

40:45.516 --> 40:47.315
We got this.

40:51.021 --> 40:52.523
Got them on the run.

40:52.556 --> 40:53.657
Let's go clean 'em up.

40:53.690 --> 40:56.293
No, it's not right.

40:56.326 --> 40:59.626
They don't just leave.

41:01.398 --> 41:03.166
What are those?

41:03.199 --> 41:05.335
[Kipling] Jesus. Hoodmen.

41:05.369 --> 41:07.038
It's the royal guard
of Nurnheim.

41:07.070 --> 41:09.372
The robot and the lunatic must
have dropped the ball on this one.

41:09.373 --> 41:10.373
This is bad.

41:10.407 --> 41:11.775
Screw 'em. We keep fighting.

41:11.809 --> 41:13.553
[Vic] We gotta take these
things out, no matter what.

41:13.577 --> 41:16.146
You're right.
We do. Sorry.

41:16.179 --> 41:18.014
Sorry for what?

41:18.047 --> 41:19.215
[grunting]

41:19.248 --> 41:20.416
Ahhh!

41:20.449 --> 41:24.186
Kipling, you... [grunts]

41:24.221 --> 41:25.871
[screaming]

41:29.458 --> 41:32.628
- Here.
- Good. Check under the chair.

41:32.663 --> 41:34.164
That won't be necessary.

41:34.197 --> 41:37.434
- It's over?
- We won?

41:37.467 --> 41:39.402
Not yet. But we will.

41:39.436 --> 41:40.635
[grunts]

41:52.449 --> 41:56.798
You have to take care of him.

41:58.288 --> 41:59.489
There's too many of them.

41:59.523 --> 42:02.222
[banging on walls]

42:10.666 --> 42:12.469
No, please.

42:12.501 --> 42:14.601
[Rita] Elliot!

42:22.646 --> 42:27.217
Grid, transfer all energy
to ionic grenade.

42:27.250 --> 42:30.153
[Vic grunting]

42:30.186 --> 42:34.690
Contain it to the room
and let it rip!

42:34.724 --> 42:37.724
[Vic's screams fade]

42:46.503 --> 42:51.242
So this is it? We just stare at
each other until the world ends?

42:51.275 --> 42:53.710
Won't be long
until the Book is read.

42:53.744 --> 42:54.911
I can feel it.

42:54.945 --> 42:57.481
The Book? You mean your son?

42:57.514 --> 42:59.349
To me,
he is the Unwritten Book.

42:59.382 --> 43:01.885
[Cliff chuckles]
I gotta hand it to you, lady.

43:01.918 --> 43:03.820
I've been a pretty shitty dad.

43:03.853 --> 43:05.521
You know,
checked out for a while now.

43:05.554 --> 43:07.423
But you take
the whole goddamn cake.

43:07.456 --> 43:08.958
Raising your only kid

43:08.992 --> 43:12.096
just so you can sacrifice him
to a death cult

43:12.128 --> 43:15.166
after killing his dad
in front of him?

43:15.199 --> 43:18.668
That there is some
top shelf bullshit.

43:18.702 --> 43:21.070
Back me up here, Tiny Tim.

43:21.103 --> 43:23.740
Oh. Uh...

43:23.773 --> 43:25.809
Very bad mother, sir.

43:25.842 --> 43:27.677
[Mother Archon]
That's only one perspective.

43:27.710 --> 43:31.215
To you, I am a bad mother.

43:31.248 --> 43:35.885
To many others, I was a
good custodian of the Book.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.454
It was always happy.

43:37.487 --> 43:41.824
[Cliff] No, that's not a perspective.
That's a delusion.

43:41.858 --> 43:45.528
And the reality is
you're a fucking psychopath.

43:45.561 --> 43:47.731
There is no reality.

43:47.764 --> 43:50.300
There is only perception.

43:50.333 --> 43:52.469
The way we see things.

43:52.501 --> 43:55.273
The way we see ourselves.

43:55.306 --> 43:57.775
No, this can't be real.
Hey, you seeing this?

43:57.807 --> 44:00.076
Jane? Jane?

44:00.110 --> 44:01.110
Jane?

44:08.085 --> 44:13.085
Then there's
how we see each other.

44:15.092 --> 44:18.061
Is this really how you see me?

44:18.094 --> 44:21.498
Clara? You think I see Jane
as my daughter?

44:21.530 --> 44:23.400
Stop this, please.

44:23.432 --> 44:24.802
[Mother Archon] First...

44:24.835 --> 44:27.838
You should see
your true essence.

44:27.871 --> 44:31.608
You're nothing more than
an organ in a container.

44:31.641 --> 44:33.510
Are you not?

44:33.543 --> 44:36.746
You? Young Kay?

44:36.780 --> 44:40.530
Scared and wounded child.

44:42.219 --> 44:45.222
But soon
all will see what will be.

44:45.255 --> 44:50.255
<i>Because the Decreator
will make everything nothing.</i>

45:07.643 --> 45:09.143
[chanting]

45:14.550 --> 45:17.550
[chanting continues]

45:40.378 --> 45:44.280
[Larry]
My God. Is that the Decreator?

45:44.313 --> 45:46.563
We're too late.

45:49.887 --> 45:54.425
[lighter clicks]

45:54.458 --> 45:56.458
Maybe I should have done
"A Hard Day's Night."
