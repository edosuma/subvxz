WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.467
<i>Previously, on "Stitchers"...</i>

00:01.492 --> 00:04.728
His father is James Miller, the man
behind the $3 billion Ponzi scheme

00:04.753 --> 00:06.923
that wiped out how many
people's life savings?

00:06.948 --> 00:08.717
He died. The funeral was yesterday.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.621
Kirsten, meet my brother.

00:10.646 --> 00:12.089
You can take the girl
out of the trailer,

00:12.114 --> 00:14.815
- but you can't take the trash...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

00:14.840 --> 00:15.898
Amanda, go!

00:17.879 --> 00:20.946
- Thanks for saving my life.
- I was just so afraid of losing you.

00:20.971 --> 00:22.850
My life makes
sense with you in it.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.518
- Are you still working with Stinger?
- No.

00:24.544 --> 00:26.243
I am not working with my father.

00:26.268 --> 00:29.488
I know where my mother is. I didn't
feel right about keeping that from you.

00:29.513 --> 00:31.583
Inside that cabinet,
there's a device

00:31.608 --> 00:33.641
that's connected to how
our cases get picked.

00:33.676 --> 00:35.442
Remember how I said I'd
help you save your mother?

00:35.466 --> 00:36.414
I meant it.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.069
We both have criminal,
absent, pathetic fathers.

00:39.094 --> 00:41.060
Except the only difference is
you're desperate to find yours

00:41.085 --> 00:42.960
and all I want to do is forget mine.

00:45.065 --> 00:46.767
Cameron?

00:50.806 --> 00:52.439
Guess what I have?

00:52.570 --> 00:53.972
What?

00:53.997 --> 00:56.418
Early Spielberg.

00:56.443 --> 00:59.344
"Duel," "The Sugarland Express,"

00:59.369 --> 01:01.687
and please don't tell your mother,

01:01.978 --> 01:03.189
"Jaws."

01:03.608 --> 01:04.974
Thanks.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.871
Hey. Why the face?

01:06.896 --> 01:10.529
Richie Freedman wanted to
come over. Mom said no.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.562
Again. Germs.

01:12.762 --> 01:15.845
Can he please come over, Dad?

01:17.966 --> 01:20.020
You had heart surgery, Cam.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.001
Richie's a great guy, he's a lot of fun,

01:23.026 --> 01:24.893
but when the two of you get going...

01:24.928 --> 01:26.675
You still gotta take it easy.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.090
For how long? It's been over a year!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.822
Everything is gonna be
great one day, Cam.

01:33.847 --> 01:35.747
I promise you.

01:41.798 --> 01:45.824
Excuse me, Sir. Any word on James
Miller? It's been two hours.

01:45.849 --> 01:47.367
He's been told you're here.

01:47.392 --> 01:50.936
Attention.
Code 1. I have code 1A, Area 5.

01:50.961 --> 01:53.002
- Sorry, Sir. You need to leave.
- What's going on?

01:53.027 --> 01:54.273
Fire alarm.

01:54.298 --> 01:55.940
Ma'am. Ma'am.

01:55.965 --> 01:59.603
All visitors proceed
to the nearest exit.

01:59.628 --> 02:00.988
It's just weird, you know?

02:01.013 --> 02:03.207
Yeah, I didn't even know
you wanted to see him.

02:03.232 --> 02:06.227
It's been, what... 13 years?

02:06.252 --> 02:08.252
- Fourteen.
- Hm.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.393
- So, why now?
- I don't know.

02:10.418 --> 02:12.151
I guess Linus's father dying

02:12.176 --> 02:13.627
affected me more than I realized.

02:13.652 --> 02:16.386
Or feelings for you are making me
want to reach out to my family.

02:16.411 --> 02:17.464
That's sweet.

02:17.489 --> 02:19.514
Well, not so sweet that
he wanted to see me.

02:21.148 --> 02:22.941
Well, look. It's a prison.

02:22.966 --> 02:25.390
The delay could have been anything.

02:25.573 --> 02:26.839
I don't know.

02:26.864 --> 02:28.776
Maybe it was just a stupid
idea to go in the first place.

02:32.747 --> 02:35.168
Hey, what's up? Welcome back.

02:35.193 --> 02:36.420
I need everyone back here.

02:36.445 --> 02:37.771
Okay, but why don't you text like usual?

02:37.796 --> 02:40.863
- Why the call?
- Something has happened to your father.

02:40.888 --> 02:42.955
He's under lockdown.

02:45.603 --> 02:48.935
We have a new case that
requires us to break protocol.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.428
Oh good, we haven't pissed
off the NSA in hours.

02:51.453 --> 02:52.950
- Not now, Camille.
- What's up?

02:52.975 --> 02:56.104
- Fisher?
- Victim is Gary Parsons, 55.

02:56.129 --> 02:58.963
A veteran officer with the
Federal Bureau of Prisons.

02:58.999 --> 03:01.465
Had a clean record and a
history of commendations

03:01.490 --> 03:03.456
until he was killed earlier today.

03:03.481 --> 03:05.644
By James Miller.

03:31.261 --> 03:32.460
Dude.

03:33.563 --> 03:36.298
That doesn't make any sense.
I was just there.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.301
Now, Miller claims that Parsons
attacked him without provocation

03:39.336 --> 03:41.095
and that he killed him in self-defense.

03:41.911 --> 03:44.879
The area of the attack had
no witnesses and no cameras.

03:44.904 --> 03:47.705
If convicted, the killing
of a federal prison guard

03:47.740 --> 03:49.640
is the death penalty.

03:49.676 --> 03:52.843
I've used my authority to
order a stitch into Parsons.

03:52.879 --> 03:56.153
Let's find out what
really happened and why.

04:01.183 --> 04:05.192
I'm in the prison.
Parsons is friendly, well-liked.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.480
- By the inmates or other guards?
- Everyone.

04:07.505 --> 04:09.505
Miller's helping younger inmates.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.507
Looks like he's teaching them math,
or accounting.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.509
I guess cheating investors
out of $3 billion

04:13.545 --> 04:15.411
qualifies you to teach.

04:15.447 --> 04:17.363
- Jimbo.
- Gary.

04:17.389 --> 04:19.488
- You got a moment?
- Yeah, you bet.

04:20.951 --> 04:22.871
They're in Miller's cell.

04:23.647 --> 04:25.930
- The wife's lasagna.
- Oh...

04:25.955 --> 04:29.087
- I know it's your favorite.
- Thanks, Gary.

04:29.112 --> 04:31.779
Thanks for saving us on that tax return.

04:31.804 --> 04:32.340
Anytime.

04:32.365 --> 04:35.062
They're friends. They
do each other favors.

04:35.087 --> 04:38.171
Hey! Welcome back!
Did I hear total remission?

04:38.196 --> 04:39.495
Can you believe it?

04:39.665 --> 04:42.569
Parsons was out a while.
Cancer it sounds like.

04:42.594 --> 04:44.528
Miller was happy to see him.

04:44.563 --> 04:46.869
- That's good news.
- It's good to be back.

04:47.459 --> 04:50.873
- I found an earlier hot spot.
- Stand by. Moving you.

04:51.670 --> 04:53.503
If Bruce tries to get to Miller,

04:53.539 --> 04:55.264
- I need to know right away.
- Sure.

04:55.289 --> 04:58.323
- He's on the phone to someone.
- Can you tell who?

04:58.348 --> 05:00.148
Adult male.

05:00.173 --> 05:01.880
He wants a warning

05:01.905 --> 05:04.475
if someone named Bruce ever
tries to get to Miller.

05:04.509 --> 05:06.409
Bruce seems to be some kind of threat.

05:06.434 --> 05:08.067
Found another memory hot spot.

05:08.091 --> 05:09.187
I think Miller's in this one, too.

05:09.212 --> 05:12.482
- Moving you again.
- He's back in his cell.

05:12.507 --> 05:14.544
Jimbo. Your son's still waiting.

05:14.699 --> 05:16.283
What do I tell him?

05:16.308 --> 05:20.056
Don't tell him anything.
Just let him go home.

05:20.081 --> 05:22.996
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

05:23.260 --> 05:24.720
We're running out of time.

05:24.745 --> 05:26.617
Okay, I'm moving you
to the death memory.

05:27.957 --> 05:30.313
I'm back where Parsons was
on his cell. Miller's with him.

05:30.338 --> 05:33.779
She didn't say who it was,
just that she'd call back in five.

05:33.804 --> 05:35.804
How did she get your number?

05:36.759 --> 05:39.381
Jimbo, I'm sorry.

05:42.269 --> 05:44.202
Gary!

05:44.227 --> 05:46.471
I'm making a bounce!

05:49.523 --> 05:51.809
Your father was telling the truth.

05:52.184 --> 05:54.328
It was self-defense.
Parsons attacked first.

05:54.353 --> 05:58.150
- Why?
- I don't know, but maybe Bruce does?

06:01.860 --> 06:03.500
- Hey.
- Mm?

06:03.525 --> 06:05.458
Can you maybe help a girl out?

06:05.493 --> 06:08.049
- With what?
- With not, uh, totally freaking out?

06:08.074 --> 06:10.507
- Trouble in paradise?
- Paradise in paradise.

06:10.532 --> 06:12.332
So, everything's great
with you and Amanda?

06:12.357 --> 06:14.121
It's better than great.

06:14.146 --> 06:16.276
- But...
- You're waiting for the shoe to drop.

06:16.301 --> 06:19.349
I'm a dropper, not the
dropee, typically.

06:19.374 --> 06:20.504
- You're scared.
- Well, yeah.

06:20.529 --> 06:23.263
Though I did just take down
a Lucky Charms Luna-bitch

06:23.288 --> 06:24.758
armed with a kitchen knife.

06:24.783 --> 06:28.005
But that I know how to do.
This is scarier.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.135
Good.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.949
Then get your head out of your ass

06:30.974 --> 06:32.564
and just be the person you are inside.

06:32.589 --> 06:33.903
Ugh.

06:33.928 --> 06:36.091
That sounds like a nightmare.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.247
Why do they ask me for advice?

06:39.609 --> 06:43.086
Oh, God. Still texting with Ivy?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.899
More like to Ivy.

06:44.924 --> 06:48.269
How many times did you text
her without a response?

06:48.294 --> 06:51.422
Linus, when a girl doesn't
text you back right away

06:51.447 --> 06:53.805
you don't just keep...
Are you kidding me?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.499
One, two, three. Stalker.

06:56.524 --> 06:58.390
Scary stalker.
Run-for-your-life stalker.

06:58.415 --> 07:00.952
I'm just worried something
happened to her.

07:00.977 --> 07:04.178
Unless I'm coming off too strong.
I can do that sometimes.

07:04.268 --> 07:06.760
It turns some people off.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.999
Linus.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.358
Not again.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.242
Principal Bruckner says you've
been showing off to the other boys?

07:27.531 --> 07:31.173
Bragging that you know Pi to 175 digits.

07:31.198 --> 07:34.036
One-hundred and eighty-five, Papa.

07:34.193 --> 07:36.464
Maybe I need to act stupid,

07:36.500 --> 07:38.040
then they would like me.

07:38.065 --> 07:39.709
Linus...

07:40.150 --> 07:42.336
there's something I have to tell you.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.723
Your mother and I

07:44.748 --> 07:46.938
have been offered jobs

07:46.963 --> 07:48.694
in Los Angeles.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.353
You will have everything there.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.654
A nice house.

07:52.690 --> 07:54.188
A new school.

07:54.213 --> 07:55.663
And friends?

07:55.688 --> 07:58.052
Will I have friends there?

07:58.295 --> 08:01.296
You will have all the friends you want.

08:01.321 --> 08:03.774
I'd be happy with one.

08:05.542 --> 08:07.408
Maybe you and Ivy just aren't...

08:07.433 --> 08:08.465
such a good idea.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.781
I thought you were starting to like her.

08:11.321 --> 08:13.410
I don't really know her.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.483
And neither do you.

08:21.304 --> 08:23.742
- You wanted to see me?
- You must be relieved.

08:23.767 --> 08:25.433
What, that my father didn't do it?

08:26.096 --> 08:29.030
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

08:29.266 --> 08:31.844
But for a while there,
I thought maybe he did.

08:32.849 --> 08:34.648
I don't really know him
anymore, you know?

08:34.673 --> 08:37.517
Well, hopefully that'll change.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.642
So, lets talk about what
happened while I was away.

08:39.836 --> 08:42.861
You mean, like, the two cases solved
and how the lab didn't blow up?

08:42.885 --> 08:45.415
You wanna tell me why you had
Camille run a few of the stitches?

08:45.440 --> 08:48.508
It's funny, I don't remember
putting that in the report.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.466
Maggie sees all.

08:51.848 --> 08:54.868
I was just working through some, um...

08:55.472 --> 08:59.404
concerns I had over Kirsten's safety.

08:59.429 --> 09:00.741
I didn't want it to affect the stitch,

09:00.766 --> 09:02.766
so I had Camille step in.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.609
- Okay, my turn.
- For what?

09:05.634 --> 09:07.329
Maggie sees all,

09:07.354 --> 09:08.936
but Cameron hears all,

09:08.961 --> 09:12.302
especially electronic sounds
coming from inside that cabinet.

09:12.327 --> 09:13.595
So...

09:13.925 --> 09:16.144
what's the dealio with
the magical mystery box?

09:16.169 --> 09:18.309
- You broke in.
- You say, "broke in,"

09:18.334 --> 09:20.229
I say, "keyed in the
six-digit unlock code."

09:20.254 --> 09:23.355
Point is, I know it has to do
with how our cases are picked.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.148
So come on, Maggie.
Boss to interim Boss,

09:26.173 --> 09:27.439
who's on the other end
picking our cases?

09:27.464 --> 09:30.698
- It's classified.
- We all know why our cases are picked.

09:30.723 --> 09:33.290
If I only knew who did the picking,
I could talk to them.

09:33.315 --> 09:35.482
I could adjust the way we stitch,
speed up the process,

09:35.507 --> 09:38.241
get Kirsten's Mom out of that damn
cryogenic tank she's cooped up in.

09:38.266 --> 09:40.500
Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten
to keep seeing her mother like that?

09:40.525 --> 09:43.375
And where... exactly...

09:43.400 --> 09:46.711
does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger
"cooped up"?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.887
How long has Kirsten
known where her mother is?

09:53.698 --> 09:56.299
How many people did
Cameron's Dad screw over?

09:56.334 --> 09:59.502
Hundreds, but people he stole
from with the name "Bruce?"

09:59.531 --> 10:02.112
- Fewer than ten.
- That's still a lot of angry Bruces.

10:02.137 --> 10:03.345
That's why I'm
cross-referencing their names

10:03.370 --> 10:05.137
against the percentage of savings lost

10:05.162 --> 10:08.122
along with any record of
death threats against Miller,

10:08.147 --> 10:11.022
which narrows our suspects to...

10:11.047 --> 10:12.595
A much more manageable two.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.206
Looks like one of them
died two years ago,

10:15.231 --> 10:17.670
leaving us with Scott Bruce.

10:17.695 --> 10:20.362
Last known address is outside Palmdale.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.421
Looks like he invested every penny.

10:23.471 --> 10:25.047
The house, the pension, he lost it all.

10:25.072 --> 10:28.207
- Divorced twelve years ago.
- He must really hate Miller.

10:28.236 --> 10:33.294
Guys, Gary Parsons was diagnosed
with Stage 3 melanoma last year.

10:33.319 --> 10:36.331
And while he was in remission, he still
had a mountain of medical bills.

10:36.356 --> 10:38.089
He was about to file for bankruptcy

10:38.114 --> 10:39.954
and then that all changed
when miraculously,

10:39.979 --> 10:41.577
two days ago, his bills were paid.

10:41.602 --> 10:44.249
So someone paid off Parsons
to kill Miller. Scott Bruce?

10:44.275 --> 10:46.160
You think Bruce squirreled away
enough money to pay off Parsons?

10:46.185 --> 10:47.280
Let's find out.

10:47.305 --> 10:50.019
Hey, you wanna help me interrogate
a 70-something potential killer?

10:50.044 --> 10:51.380
Fishy.

10:51.405 --> 10:54.905
You always know just what to get me.

10:56.994 --> 11:00.098
Yo, bro, what happened?

11:00.123 --> 11:02.495
Maggie happened.

11:02.946 --> 11:04.689
You look pale.

11:04.843 --> 11:06.765
- What's wrong?
- Oh, I'm fine.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.300
I just, uh...
I just need to figure out a way

11:08.325 --> 11:10.358
to see my Dad and find
out what really happened.

11:10.383 --> 11:12.730
Camille and Fisher just
left to talk to somebody

11:12.755 --> 11:14.084
who might be the Bruce
we're looking for.

11:14.109 --> 11:17.148
I'll bet my father knows who Bruce is.
I should go talk to him.

11:17.173 --> 11:18.908
Cameron.

11:18.933 --> 11:23.075
I saw your father tell Parsons
he didn't want to see you.

11:39.284 --> 11:41.646
Are we sure this is the place?

11:41.671 --> 11:44.472
GPS, WAZE and my police
scanner can't all be wrong.

11:44.507 --> 11:46.373
Come on.

12:02.005 --> 12:03.650
Are you okay?

12:03.675 --> 12:05.240
Are you hurt? Do you need help?

12:05.265 --> 12:06.726
I broke my bike.

12:06.751 --> 12:09.091
It was my birthday
present, and I broke it.

12:09.116 --> 12:13.228
They can't afford it,
but they knew how much I wanted it.

12:13.253 --> 12:15.390
How am I gonna tell them I broke it?

12:15.415 --> 12:18.282
Don't worry, honey. Here.

12:18.307 --> 12:21.044
This should be more than
enough to get it fixed.

12:21.069 --> 12:23.291
I'm not allowed to take
money from strangers.

12:23.316 --> 12:26.454
It's okay, sweetie, this time.

12:29.243 --> 12:32.614
You're the nicest person I ever met.

12:32.639 --> 12:36.006
You know, just in case
fifty's not enough.

12:38.537 --> 12:40.342
Thank you.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.654
Bye.

12:47.514 --> 12:49.351
Sucker.

12:58.218 --> 12:59.473
Oh, hell.

13:04.437 --> 13:06.914
Possession of marijuana
with intent to distribute

13:06.939 --> 13:09.006
is up to six months and a $500 fine.

13:16.572 --> 13:19.299
- Scott Bruce?
- Yes.

13:20.659 --> 13:22.559
Mr. Bruce, I'm Detective Quincy Fisher,

13:22.584 --> 13:24.791
this is Agent Engelson of the NSA.

13:24.816 --> 13:27.056
We'd like to talk to you
about James Miller.

13:27.081 --> 13:28.641
Is he in trouble again?

13:28.728 --> 13:30.094
Maybe.

13:30.746 --> 13:33.880
I'm sorry to hear that.
I owe my life to Jim Miller.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.728
What? I'm sorry, didn't he steal,
like, all your money?

13:36.753 --> 13:38.720
He did.

13:38.998 --> 13:40.698
Either of you fish?

13:40.723 --> 13:41.965
A little.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.289
This...

13:43.314 --> 13:45.699
is a deceiver fly.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.369
The bass lock onto it,

13:48.394 --> 13:50.038
the same way I used to lock onto money.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.097
Oh, come on now, you're not...

13:53.122 --> 13:55.265
really going with a
fishing analogy, are you?

13:55.290 --> 13:57.672
All I'm saying is before Miller,

13:57.697 --> 13:59.884
all I cared about was
the almighty dollar.

13:59.909 --> 14:01.977
Well, sure, but you must have been

14:02.035 --> 14:05.003
- pissed when you lost it all, right?
- Of course.

14:05.070 --> 14:08.171
But I made the choice
to invest with him,

14:08.207 --> 14:11.174
I got caught up in his claims
of unrealistic returns.

14:11.210 --> 14:14.044
At some point,
I had to own up to my own greed.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.179
That forced me to change.

14:16.215 --> 14:19.216
I got remarried, downsized,

14:19.251 --> 14:21.318
and now I live a much simpler,

14:21.353 --> 14:24.855
much better life.

14:24.890 --> 14:28.993
Thanks to Jim Miller, I finally started
to care about what really matters.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.031
Thank you for your time.

14:34.066 --> 14:35.298
Sorry to bother you.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.101
No worries.

14:38.137 --> 14:40.338
I hope Jim's okay.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.874
Tell me you're not buying this.
Deceiver fly?

14:43.909 --> 14:45.738
- What are we doing?
- He seems happy to me.

14:45.763 --> 14:48.011
No one's happy in a trailer park.

14:48.057 --> 14:50.141
No way that guy squirreled away

14:50.166 --> 14:52.233
enough money to pay off
Parsons' medical bills.

14:52.268 --> 14:55.136
He's not our Bruce. Let's go.

15:03.657 --> 15:06.224
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, come on in. Take a seat.

15:06.254 --> 15:07.687
This isn't a trip to the
principal's office, is it?

15:07.722 --> 15:10.356
- Ha! Not yet.
- Okay...

15:10.392 --> 15:12.492
- How are things going with Ivy?
- Isn't that private?

15:12.527 --> 15:14.966
No, not really.

15:14.991 --> 15:17.191
Look, I know that
she helped with the team...

15:17.216 --> 15:20.183
- I know you don't trust her...
- If you'd let me finish,

15:20.219 --> 15:23.086
I said, I know that she
helped with the team,

15:23.122 --> 15:26.156
which is why I am considering
letting her work with us.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.458
- Really?
- Yes, of course she has to be vetted

15:28.494 --> 15:30.857
and cleared first. I mean,
nothing is guaranteed,

15:30.882 --> 15:33.173
but I am willing to start the process.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.231
I just wanted you to know.

15:34.928 --> 15:36.698
Thanks.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.019
Don't make me regret it.

15:42.044 --> 15:43.693
I know you won't.

15:59.782 --> 16:02.472
So, I'm thinking about going
and seeing my Mom tomorrow.

16:02.497 --> 16:03.481
You want to come?

16:04.432 --> 16:05.465
Sure.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.403
You're quiet tonight.

16:10.438 --> 16:12.372
Yeah, there's a lot on my mind

16:12.407 --> 16:15.408
with my Dad and Maggie coming back.

16:15.443 --> 16:17.343
I hope she appreciates
how you handed back

16:17.379 --> 16:19.032
the keys to the lab
without a single dent.

16:19.057 --> 16:21.591
Ha. Actually, she was more concerned

16:21.616 --> 16:23.689
about me turning over some
of the stitches to Camille.

16:23.714 --> 16:25.648
Well, that was only two of them.

16:25.683 --> 16:27.549
Well, I handled that one okay, I think.

16:27.585 --> 16:30.519
It's just, um, then I asked her
about the cube and the credenza,

16:30.554 --> 16:32.755
and who's selecting
our cases, and, uh...

16:32.790 --> 16:35.357
you know, because
I wanted to find out for you.

16:35.393 --> 16:37.393
What did she say?

16:37.428 --> 16:39.051
Nothing helpful,

16:39.076 --> 16:40.629
so I pressed her...

16:40.665 --> 16:43.452
Were you guys gonna use this?
What am I saying. Okay.

16:43.477 --> 16:46.709
Updates. So, I'm sorry to
report Scott Bruce was a bust.

16:46.734 --> 16:49.533
Apparently the man is perfectly happy
with his trailer park existence.

16:49.558 --> 16:51.133
No accounting for taste.

16:51.162 --> 16:53.996
So it looks like he's not the
Bruce Parsons was talking about.

16:54.032 --> 16:57.198
Plus, all Parsons' medical bills
were paid from an offshore account

16:57.223 --> 17:00.157
which is proving to be impossible
to source, even for me.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.292
So, dead end?

17:01.327 --> 17:03.127
Well, until Miss "Eggshell Blue" here

17:03.162 --> 17:05.061
can stitch back into Parsons.

17:05.098 --> 17:07.465
The head trauma's giving us over a
day left on the refractory period.

17:07.491 --> 17:09.573
And for your information,
this is "Ice Blue."

17:09.598 --> 17:11.805
Again, no accounting for taste.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.597
Go talk to your Dad.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.535
Just ask him who Bruce is.
We're NSA, we have badges.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.911
He doesn't want to talk to me.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.704
And if anyone hears that
Miller's been talking to the NSA,

17:20.739 --> 17:21.805
they'll think he's a snitch.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.707
Which can really shorten
your prison time.

17:23.742 --> 17:24.741
The only person that can safely

17:24.777 --> 17:27.463
talk to Cameron's father
right now is his lawyer.

17:28.556 --> 17:31.884
Well, Counselor.

17:41.676 --> 17:44.070
He said my lawyer was here to see me.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.566
You're not the only one
who can pull off a scam.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.542
Okay, look...

17:49.577 --> 17:53.906
just so you know, there are a lot of
things I want to say to you right now.

17:55.176 --> 17:56.909
But for now, I'll just say this.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.715
I work for the government,

18:01.138 --> 18:04.839
and I am here to help you.

18:04.864 --> 18:06.989
Hold on. You work for the government?

18:07.014 --> 18:08.662
I-I thought you were a PhD.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.388
Oh, so you have been keeping tabs on me.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.278
- You're my son.
- You remember.

18:13.303 --> 18:14.691
Okay, I get that you're angry.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.693
You have no idea how I feel.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.966
Why would you? You haven't picked
up a phone in fourteen years.

18:18.991 --> 18:20.464
Cameron, it's complicated.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.576
- I need you to leave now.
- No.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.521
Not until you help me
make it less complicated.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.524
I know all about Parsons.

18:29.675 --> 18:30.908
Why'd he attack you?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.971
Who's Bruce?

18:32.996 --> 18:35.201
Bruce? What are you talking about?

18:35.226 --> 18:38.194
Can you think of anyone who
might've paid Parsons to kill you?

18:38.229 --> 18:39.971
Okay, we're done here.

18:39.996 --> 18:41.496
No.

18:43.147 --> 18:44.761
One more question.

18:45.462 --> 18:47.417
Where'd you put the money?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.437
After you were caught all
the money was accounted for

18:51.462 --> 18:54.760
except for thirty million.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.922
- Where did you hide it?
- Leave. Now.

18:58.947 --> 19:01.369
Cameron, it's for your own good.

19:01.394 --> 19:02.767
Right.

19:03.544 --> 19:05.411
Because you've always
done such a good job

19:05.436 --> 19:07.269
of protecting me.

19:12.996 --> 19:14.444
Dad!

19:16.404 --> 19:19.327
James Miller, Joe Zeiss,
Securities and Exchange Commission.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.159
You're under arrest
for securities fraud,

19:21.184 --> 19:23.766
investment adviser fraud,
mail fraud, wire fraud,

19:23.791 --> 19:25.557
three counts of money laundering,

19:25.582 --> 19:27.310
and false filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

19:27.341 --> 19:30.244
- Dad! What's happening?
- Get your hands off my son.

19:30.268 --> 19:31.758
- Let go of me!
- Where's his mother?

19:31.783 --> 19:33.683
- She's at work.
- Don't hurt him!

19:33.708 --> 19:35.641
Cam, I'm fine. Please calm down.

19:35.666 --> 19:36.943
He just had heart surgery.

19:36.953 --> 19:40.033
- Let go of my Dad!
- All right, everyone just relax.

19:41.936 --> 19:44.736
Cameron, everything's going to be okay.

19:44.761 --> 19:46.356
We're calling your Mom

19:46.381 --> 19:48.982
and a nice lady from the police is
gonna stay with you until she gets here.

19:49.007 --> 19:51.874
What are you doing with my Dad?

19:51.910 --> 19:53.918
We just have to take him
down to the police station

19:53.943 --> 19:55.772
because we need to ask
him a few questions.

19:55.797 --> 19:58.306
Dad, did you do something wrong?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.279
I'm done here.

20:17.785 --> 20:20.093
Miller just had a visit from his lawyer.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.793
I thought Miller could do better.

20:21.818 --> 20:23.073
The kid looks a little green.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.538
Describe him.

20:24.563 --> 20:27.313
White male, twenties, big hair.

20:27.338 --> 20:29.687
That wasn't his lawyer.

20:38.557 --> 20:41.258
Maybe we should just call it?

20:41.293 --> 20:43.039
Call who now?

20:43.064 --> 20:46.769
Girl, you're so far away I
need a passport to reach you.

20:47.030 --> 20:51.464
I'm sorry. It's this
case I'm on right now.

20:51.489 --> 20:53.142
It's just...

20:53.167 --> 20:56.434
It's bringing up a lot
of really bad memories.

20:56.459 --> 20:58.007
Bad memories of what?

21:02.218 --> 21:04.085
Oh, God.

21:06.267 --> 21:08.100
Why do you like me?

21:08.125 --> 21:10.192
Wow.

21:10.229 --> 21:12.062
These memories must be potent.

21:12.097 --> 21:14.721
No, I'm serious. Why do you like me?

21:14.746 --> 21:16.279
Like...

21:17.059 --> 21:19.192
why does anyone, you know? I'm...

21:19.228 --> 21:22.295
sarcastic and cynical and not very nice.

21:22.331 --> 21:24.408
Fine, I'll play.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.399
- You're beautiful.
- Ugh...

21:26.435 --> 21:28.301
And smart.

21:28.337 --> 21:29.747
And funny.

21:30.005 --> 21:32.255
And you're kinder than you think.

21:33.141 --> 21:35.808
- You're honest.
- I'm not, though.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.953
I hide how I feel all the time.

21:39.014 --> 21:40.328
Not with me.

21:40.353 --> 21:43.427
Maybe that just proves how
good I am at scamming people.

21:46.293 --> 21:49.961
Are you deliberately
trying to sabotage this?

21:49.986 --> 21:51.413
No.

21:51.438 --> 21:52.570
I've never seen this side of you.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.814
Well, this is me.

21:54.839 --> 21:57.149
Welcome to the sideshow.

22:00.092 --> 22:02.960
I've known lots of
people who are afraid of

22:02.985 --> 22:04.351
getting close,

22:04.376 --> 22:06.492
getting hurt.

22:07.027 --> 22:08.326
And you all do the same thing.

22:08.351 --> 22:11.185
You push people away.

22:11.210 --> 22:13.410
Hey, Kirsten.

22:13.435 --> 22:16.169
Sorry, I gotta go.

22:17.239 --> 22:19.880
Call me... if you want.

22:24.406 --> 22:26.972
I'm sorry, did I just
walk in on something?

22:27.443 --> 22:29.609
You think?

22:30.175 --> 22:32.957
You know, sometimes you can
be a little bit of a bully.

22:32.982 --> 22:34.181
Well...

22:34.206 --> 22:36.206
sometimes you can be a
little bit of a stupid.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.264
Excuse me?

22:37.289 --> 22:40.056
You know, Kirsten,

22:40.081 --> 22:42.593
believe it or not, there are
days when I actually miss

22:42.618 --> 22:44.318
the old "feelings challenged" you,

22:44.343 --> 22:46.110
because now you have this, like,

22:46.135 --> 22:48.493
huge emotional blindspot,

22:48.518 --> 22:50.134
where, when it comes to certain people,

22:50.159 --> 22:51.829
you actually care too much.

22:51.854 --> 22:53.955
Certain people?

22:55.058 --> 22:57.653
Why aren't you more suspicious of Ivy?

22:58.068 --> 23:00.352
Yeah, she says she's done with Stinger,

23:00.377 --> 23:02.977
but those are just words.

23:03.002 --> 23:04.609
News flash, Princess,

23:04.634 --> 23:08.269
out here in the real world, people lie.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.404
People lie all the time.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.406
Possession of marijuana
with intent to distribute

23:12.442 --> 23:14.475
is up to six months and a $500 fine.

23:14.510 --> 23:16.644
I told you, it's not mine.
I was holding it for someone.

23:16.679 --> 23:18.446
Really? Who?

23:18.481 --> 23:20.684
Me. It's mine.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.943
Quiet, Milly. Don't listen to her.

23:23.494 --> 23:26.209
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

23:27.264 --> 23:29.965
Don't do this. I'm the big
brother, let me take care of you.

23:30.334 --> 23:32.078
Come on, all right.

23:33.958 --> 23:35.938
- Now, look at me.
- Don't tell her anything.

23:35.963 --> 23:37.929
Shut up!

23:37.954 --> 23:41.045
Are you telling me the truth?
Is this really yours?

23:43.008 --> 23:44.874
- Where'd you get it?
- Found it.

23:44.910 --> 23:47.052
Out by the road.

23:51.353 --> 23:53.226
If I get another call
about you loitering...

23:53.251 --> 23:54.833
Yeah, okay, Officer.

23:57.396 --> 23:59.158
And next time you cross the line,

23:59.193 --> 24:02.149
I will arrest you,
no matter how young you are.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.325
It's pretty stupid of you,

24:07.349 --> 24:09.221
letting yourself get arrested
to protect your sister.

24:09.247 --> 24:11.139
Brave... stupid.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.827
Look out for her.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.186
You really screwed up this time!

24:29.211 --> 24:32.264
- You could have been arrested!
- Why? It's your pot.

24:32.289 --> 24:33.991
You're so lucky I covered for you.

24:34.016 --> 24:36.850
Stop smoking that crap,
it's making you dumb.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.028
- Where you going?
- Away from you, loser.

24:39.053 --> 24:41.393
Yeah, where you gonna go?
To the friends you don't have?

24:41.418 --> 24:44.276
Nobody likes you, Milly. Deal with it.

24:45.176 --> 24:47.176
People lie all the time.

24:47.201 --> 24:48.500
Why can't you see that?

24:48.525 --> 24:50.358
She's my sister,

24:50.393 --> 24:52.160
and I'm supposed to protect her.

24:52.195 --> 24:55.619
Ivy is an adult.

24:56.199 --> 24:59.400
She doesn't need her baby
sister protecting her.

25:03.306 --> 25:05.239
It's unlocked.

25:07.097 --> 25:09.130
Hey, man, sorry for
the last-minute text.

25:09.155 --> 25:10.506
Dude, it's me. You don't
have to apologize.

25:10.531 --> 25:13.165
- Leftover risotto?
- I'm good, thanks.

25:13.190 --> 25:14.492
I don't have much of an appetite.

25:14.517 --> 25:17.975
- Okay, touch of the grape?
- That I can do.

25:18.895 --> 25:20.421
- So, what's up?
- Ivy.

25:20.457 --> 25:23.224
- Dude...
- I know. Look, I know.

25:23.259 --> 25:26.361
Just... things were going great and then
all of a sudden she started ghosting me.

25:26.396 --> 25:28.496
- I don't know what to do.
- Well...

25:28.531 --> 25:31.165
I've been on a roller coaster
with Kirsten since day one,

25:31.201 --> 25:34.659
so I'm probably the worst person to ask.

25:36.245 --> 25:38.411
How did things go with your Dad today?

25:39.282 --> 25:41.148
I don't know, not well.

25:42.318 --> 25:44.285
I offered to help him,
and he told me to leave.

25:46.055 --> 25:47.188
I'm so sorry, man.

25:47.223 --> 25:49.190
It's okay.

25:49.225 --> 25:50.391
It just...

25:50.426 --> 25:53.973
It just makes me realize,
you know, what you had

25:53.998 --> 25:55.997
with your Dad, and...

25:56.165 --> 25:59.100
I realize how much you must miss him.

26:01.861 --> 26:05.239
Linus... Linus...

26:05.274 --> 26:07.975
Not again. What happened?

26:08.010 --> 26:09.590
The upperclassmen.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.831
They don't like a fifth grader
being smarter than them.

26:11.856 --> 26:15.102
- Were you showing off again?
- No. They jumped me for my notes.

26:15.142 --> 26:18.305
It's not worth it. Don't fight them,
Linus. Just give them the notes!

26:18.330 --> 26:20.164
But they're my notes.

26:20.199 --> 26:22.199
I did the work, not them.

26:22.234 --> 26:24.134
It's just like it was in Michigan.

26:24.170 --> 26:26.236
Everybody hates me here.

26:26.875 --> 26:29.273
It's okay, Linus.

26:29.308 --> 26:31.275
Things will get better.

26:31.310 --> 26:33.076
And until then,

26:33.101 --> 26:35.134
you'll always have your mother and me.

26:35.159 --> 26:37.178
I don't want you.

26:38.384 --> 26:40.516
I want friends.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.383
Easy there, buddy.

26:49.586 --> 26:51.393
All right, heads or tails?

26:51.418 --> 26:52.751
Uh... let's go heads.

26:52.776 --> 26:54.280
Okay.

26:55.386 --> 26:57.950
All right, heads it is. You go, I pay.

27:02.456 --> 27:04.256
That was fast.

27:04.995 --> 27:06.228
Yo. Hey!

27:06.253 --> 27:08.002
What...

27:10.533 --> 27:12.782
You saw James Miller today.
What did he tell

27:12.818 --> 27:14.982
Who? I don't know who
you're talking about.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.229
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing!

27:19.254 --> 27:20.990
Hey, let him go!

27:30.412 --> 27:32.412
- Yo, dude. Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27:32.447 --> 27:34.480
- What was that?
- They knew I saw my Dad today.

27:34.516 --> 27:36.716
They wanted to know what he told me.
I didn't tell them.

27:36.751 --> 27:38.449
Yeah, yeah. You're smart.

27:38.474 --> 27:41.185
That was pretty bad-ass.

27:41.210 --> 27:43.168
Maybe next time, you pay, I go, huh?

27:43.193 --> 27:44.043
Deal.

27:44.068 --> 27:46.572
Someone really doesn't
want you talking to your father.

27:46.788 --> 27:49.055
Or they want you talking so
they can get information.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.319
Or Camille's just saying that
so she can disagree with me.

27:51.344 --> 27:52.954
Not everything's about you, Princess.

27:52.983 --> 27:55.050
I think they're just after
the mountain of Ponzi cash

27:55.086 --> 27:57.276
- they assume my dad's sitting on.
- That makes sense.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.000
I just don't know how
they're connected to Parsons.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.457
- Any thoughts, "Sister of the Year"?
- Let it go.

28:01.482 --> 28:03.275
Dude, there is a current
of subtext flowing

28:03.300 --> 28:05.093
through here like hot molten magma.

28:05.118 --> 28:05.878
Let's disperse.

28:05.903 --> 28:08.348
No, stay right there.
I want you both to hear this.

28:08.383 --> 28:11.331
I am not picking between
my friend and my sister.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.158
I didn't ask you to.

28:13.183 --> 28:16.251
Good, because Maggie is thinking about
giving Ivy a chance with all of us.

28:16.276 --> 28:17.739
Really?

28:18.013 --> 28:20.990
I can't even.

28:28.570 --> 28:30.236
What is that about?

28:30.272 --> 28:32.305
Ah, nothing.
Just a little tension in the team.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.090
Does Kirsten know that you
told me about her mother?

28:34.115 --> 28:36.249
No, I haven't told her yet.

28:36.623 --> 28:39.134
Maybe it's best that you don't.

28:44.753 --> 28:47.142
So, Ivy, huh?

28:49.490 --> 28:51.223
Look, I'm sorry, Linus.

28:51.248 --> 28:53.816
Kirsten and I are having a thing.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.177
And Amanda and I are having a thing,
and now I guess

28:57.318 --> 29:00.186
you and I are having yet another thing.

29:03.305 --> 29:05.558
There's that killer Ahluwalia smile.

29:07.248 --> 29:08.778
Is Ivy still radio silent?

29:10.012 --> 29:11.059
Yeah.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.970
Well, sometimes people just need space.

29:13.007 --> 29:14.874
Amanda's been...

29:14.916 --> 29:17.183
ghosting me all morning. It'll pass.

29:17.219 --> 29:19.216
You think so?

29:19.955 --> 29:24.012
Yeah, if we can both stop
acting like such idiots.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.777
Look, I'm not doing anything...

29:31.802 --> 29:32.883
until you...

29:32.908 --> 29:34.930
make good on your promise.

29:34.955 --> 29:37.724
Parsons is meeting some
guy in a Benz in a parking lot.

29:37.749 --> 29:39.616
Suit. Beard.

29:39.641 --> 29:41.430
Mid-Forties.

29:41.455 --> 29:42.621
Banker type.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.624
Your medical bills will be
paid by the end of the day.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.726
It's the guy who paid Parsons'
medical bills.

29:47.761 --> 29:49.761
The guy who paid to
have my father killed?

29:49.797 --> 29:51.395
Can you get the license plate number?

29:51.420 --> 29:53.702
Not yet. Parsons is
standing next to the car.

29:53.727 --> 29:56.338
He might not have seen the plates.

29:56.363 --> 30:00.673
Whoa. I think Parsons'
head injury is affecting the stitch.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.358
- She's slipping in and out of sync.
- Try to lock it down.

30:03.383 --> 30:05.317
Got it.

30:05.342 --> 30:07.209
You'll be in remission and debt free.

30:07.234 --> 30:08.661
Not a bad way to live,

30:08.686 --> 30:10.867
as long as you hold up your end.

30:11.563 --> 30:13.951
Guy's driving off.

30:14.112 --> 30:15.371
Get the plates.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.130
Sorry, too late. I'm in another memory.

30:18.230 --> 30:21.391
I'm in the prison, I think.
It's hard to see.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.570
- Try now.
- How's it looking, Shawshank?

30:24.595 --> 30:26.522
Parsons is calling someone.

30:26.547 --> 30:30.037
Hey. Yeah, uh...
Bruce is here to see Miller.

30:30.341 --> 30:32.608
Want me to get him out of here?

30:32.633 --> 30:34.984
Yeah, this is Parsons in Area 5.

30:35.009 --> 30:38.379
Code 1A. Yeah, I'm
smelling smoke down here.

30:38.910 --> 30:42.049
- Sync is out.
- I'm bouncing.

30:45.254 --> 30:46.367
Okay, that was weird.

30:46.392 --> 30:48.595
Parsons' head injury
made it hard to hold sync.

30:48.620 --> 30:51.248
No, not that. Bruce tried
to visit Miller in prison,

30:51.273 --> 30:52.765
but Miller wouldn't see him.

30:52.790 --> 30:54.654
And to make sure that Bruce left,

30:54.679 --> 30:56.897
Parsons called in a fire alarm.

30:58.877 --> 31:01.374
Dad, did you do something wrong?

31:03.534 --> 31:06.197
I see you like Batman.

31:06.385 --> 31:08.544
You know,

31:08.569 --> 31:11.160
you're being so brave right now,

31:11.185 --> 31:13.830
it reminds me of Bruce Wayne.

31:13.855 --> 31:15.502
You know what?

31:15.527 --> 31:17.835
That's what I'm gonna call you.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.504
Bruce.

31:22.747 --> 31:25.087
I'm Bruce.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.919
So, if Bruce is Cameron,

31:33.952 --> 31:37.167
then the caller who asked
Parsons to watch out for Cameron

31:37.192 --> 31:39.159
must be the guy from the SEC.

31:39.184 --> 31:41.597
It's Joe Zeiss, their top gun out of DC.

31:41.622 --> 31:43.689
He nailed a bunch of mega-scumbags,

31:43.724 --> 31:46.343
then retired to Calabasas
right after Miller's trial.

31:46.368 --> 31:48.433
- That's him.
- And with a beard and fourteen years,

31:48.458 --> 31:49.780
the same guy I saw in the stitch.

31:49.805 --> 31:51.671
But why would he care if
I came to see my father?

31:51.707 --> 31:53.840
I can think of thirty-million
missing reasons.

31:53.876 --> 31:56.510
Zeiss stole the money, hid it,
then blackmailed your father

31:56.545 --> 31:59.088
into taking the blame in
exchange for your safety.

31:59.113 --> 32:01.816
We did some checking.
Zeiss is on a convenient business trip,

32:01.841 --> 32:04.384
- but he gets back tomorrow.
- Then that's when we will arrest him.

32:04.409 --> 32:07.508
- What about my father?
- Bring Miller in, make sure he's safe.

32:29.618 --> 32:30.858
You look well.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.011
What part...

32:33.036 --> 32:34.369
of stop texting,

32:34.394 --> 32:37.394
stop calling, stop harassing me,

32:37.419 --> 32:39.029
don't you understand?

32:39.054 --> 32:41.250
Come on. We're family.

32:43.486 --> 32:45.589
We're all each other has.

32:46.325 --> 32:48.746
That is not true.

32:48.771 --> 32:50.635
I have a sister...

32:51.230 --> 32:52.971
have friends.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.881
I have a brilliant young man

32:56.913 --> 32:59.326
who loves me,

32:59.351 --> 33:01.554
but who I haven't spoken to in days

33:01.579 --> 33:04.395
because I'm afraid if he finds
out you've been talking to me

33:04.420 --> 33:05.686
he won't trust me anymore.

33:05.711 --> 33:07.277
Listen to me,

33:07.302 --> 33:09.946
I know exactly how
Maggie Baptiste thinks.

33:10.628 --> 33:14.034
She's using Linus to get to you,
to get to me.

33:14.310 --> 33:17.158
But I'm smarter than she is.

33:17.183 --> 33:20.624
That's why I want you
to stay close to Linus.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.139
Make him trust you.

33:23.593 --> 33:25.957
Help us find out where Jacqueline is.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.592
No.

33:27.617 --> 33:30.583
How do you think your
new friends would feel...

33:31.543 --> 33:33.419
if they found out who was really behind

33:33.444 --> 33:36.056
the Young Cameron anomaly?

33:37.114 --> 33:39.059
Get out of my apartment.

34:07.057 --> 34:08.598
Where am I?

34:08.623 --> 34:10.656
Someplace safe.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.803
Somewhere Joe Zeiss can't
try to have you killed again.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.764
Look, I know the truth.

34:18.952 --> 34:22.077
I know Zeiss skimmed the $30 million

34:22.101 --> 34:23.953
and pinned it on you.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.822
I know he threatened to kill me

34:25.847 --> 34:27.547
if you ever told anyone the truth,

34:27.581 --> 34:30.193
and you did an extra
seven years because of it.

34:31.818 --> 34:34.864
Tomorrow, Joe Zeiss
is gonna be arrested.

34:35.663 --> 34:38.534
And I'm gonna do it myself.

34:39.751 --> 34:41.717
You can arrest people?

34:41.753 --> 34:43.487
I thought you were a
government scientist.

34:43.513 --> 34:47.585
There's a lot about me from the
last 14 years you don't know.

34:53.489 --> 34:56.291
When you were sick,

34:56.326 --> 34:59.527
and it looked like your mother
and I were going to lose you,

34:59.563 --> 35:02.642
you have no idea what that did to me.

35:05.202 --> 35:07.435
And the thought that that bastard Zeiss

35:07.471 --> 35:10.305
was out there watching you,
that he might hurt you...

35:10.340 --> 35:13.653
- You don't have to protect me anymore.
- I don't know how to stop.

35:15.412 --> 35:18.613
Look, the prosecutors
are reviewing your case.

35:18.648 --> 35:21.549
Any of this might lead the way to a...

35:21.585 --> 35:24.206
reduced sentence.

35:32.289 --> 35:35.383
I made some mistakes, Cam.

35:38.327 --> 35:40.919
I never set out to hurt anyone.

35:41.466 --> 35:44.290
And then I got in too
deep before I could

35:44.315 --> 35:47.237
make the investors whole again.

35:48.140 --> 35:51.440
I'm just so embarrassed for
you to see me like this.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.070
I deserve to be in jail for what I did.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.827
But not for what you didn't.

36:38.341 --> 36:40.643
- She's gone!
- Whoa. Who's gone?

36:40.668 --> 36:44.236
My mother. Her chamber, the computers,
the monitors... everything is just gone.

36:44.271 --> 36:47.115
Stinger must have found her.
God, that son of a bitch!

36:47.146 --> 36:51.259
Kristen, just calm down.
It wasn't... it wasn't Stinger.

36:51.284 --> 36:54.895
- It was Maggie.
- Maggie didn't know where she was!

36:56.548 --> 36:58.114
What did you do?

36:58.139 --> 37:01.407
I was just talking to Maggie and it...

37:01.432 --> 37:03.032
It slipped.

37:03.057 --> 37:04.890
It slipped?

37:08.572 --> 37:11.144
My mother's location just slipped out?

37:11.169 --> 37:13.018
- Kirsten...
- I trusted you, Cameron,

37:13.042 --> 37:16.651
with the most important
thing in the world.

37:17.438 --> 37:19.104
How could you betray me?

37:19.129 --> 37:21.963
Kirsten, I didn't mean to.
I just... Can be please talk?

37:21.988 --> 37:24.244
Hey. Listen to me. Just stay, please.

37:24.269 --> 37:27.017
No. Right now, I wouldn't want
to be with you even if I could.

37:27.042 --> 37:30.396
- Where are you going?
- To be with someone that I trust.

37:34.082 --> 37:36.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:36.859 --> 37:40.227
Thanks for coming. I'm, uh... I'm...

37:40.252 --> 37:42.759
Sorry about the other night?

37:42.784 --> 37:44.434
Yeah.

37:44.459 --> 37:46.908
God, am I really that much of a cliche?

37:46.933 --> 37:50.747
No, you're just...
that much of a human being.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.399
I'm sorry I walked out.

37:53.435 --> 37:55.168
Me, too.

37:55.203 --> 37:57.303
I kind of really took it out on Kirsten.

37:57.338 --> 37:59.038
I guess I owe her an apology.

37:59.073 --> 38:01.780
Oh, please. Get in line.

38:03.244 --> 38:05.244
Amanda,

38:05.280 --> 38:08.388
this whole thing with us...

38:08.413 --> 38:12.348
the whole "take off your armor
and bare your soul" thing,

38:12.383 --> 38:14.383
it's new to me.

38:14.419 --> 38:16.385
I'm bad at it.

38:17.655 --> 38:20.456
It's really scary but it's so great,

38:20.491 --> 38:23.392
because I just think...
I think you're so awesome

38:23.428 --> 38:25.227
and...

38:25.263 --> 38:28.180
the way you make me feel
when I'm with you and...

38:29.300 --> 38:30.517
I just...

38:31.402 --> 38:32.864
I really...

38:32.889 --> 38:34.489
uh...

38:35.794 --> 38:37.189
Really...?

38:41.612 --> 38:43.927
I really think you

38:43.952 --> 38:46.992
are worth taking a shot on.

38:48.252 --> 38:49.995
"Worth taking a shot on"?

38:50.020 --> 38:51.329
Yeah.

38:56.053 --> 38:58.055
You just don't get it.

39:00.144 --> 39:01.910
What?

39:01.935 --> 39:05.260
I don't want to be anyone's shot.

39:34.011 --> 39:35.019
Nice place.

39:35.044 --> 39:38.072
Yeah. Zeiss knows how to
spend other people's money.

39:38.604 --> 39:41.304
- You ready for this?
- Let's get him.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.715
All right.

39:46.057 --> 39:48.772
Hi. What's your name?

39:48.797 --> 39:51.097
- Andrew.
- Andrew.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.058
Is your Dad home?

39:55.104 --> 39:57.395
Not now.

39:58.126 --> 40:00.064
What's up?

40:01.129 --> 40:03.714
Not in front of his son.

40:06.876 --> 40:08.740
You sure?

40:10.726 --> 40:12.796
Hey, Andrew.

40:12.821 --> 40:15.079
I think we have the wrong address.

40:15.317 --> 40:17.084
Okay.

41:10.422 --> 41:12.322
Hey, Ivy.

41:12.347 --> 41:13.972
It's me.

41:14.282 --> 41:17.917
Look, I'm not sure what's
going on here, but...

41:17.942 --> 41:19.649
I just wanted to let you know

41:19.674 --> 41:21.707
that I'm here for you
whenever you need me to be.

41:21.732 --> 41:25.501
And I wanted you to know
that I'm your friend.
