NARRATOR:<i> Coming tonight</i>
<i>on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.628 --> 00:07.424
Oh, Lord. She done killed him, Mr. Renko.
She done killed Lance.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.342
(clamoring)

00:09.426 --> 00:10.719
-MAN: Help!
-Jerry!

00:10.802 --> 00:12.512
(clamoring)

00:12.595 --> 00:14.973
My client is being charged
with resisting arrest

00:15.056 --> 00:17.100
and attempted assault on a police officer,

00:17.183 --> 00:18.476
and he's the only one that got hurt.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.728
What are you talkin' about?

00:19.811 --> 00:22.105
I'm talkin' about a guy
I've known my entire life

00:22.188 --> 00:24.190
who's walkin' around in these $400 suits

00:24.274 --> 00:26.568
and actin' like he's some big
mob guy or somethin'.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.320
Get out of there, Jerry. She's gonna blow!

00:33.575 --> 00:36.286
(chattering)

00:39.998 --> 00:43.293
(chattering)

00:43.376 --> 00:45.378
-PHIL: Item nine.
-Sarge.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.756
Oh, Bates,
I'm getting right on it. Ladies.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.175
-ALL: Thank you.
-Item nine.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.261
It appears the more juvenile
among us are at it again.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.432
Be advised, the Female Police Officers
Advancement Coalition

00:58.099 --> 01:00.685
has filed a complaint against
an unnamed prankster

01:00.769 --> 01:04.439
who insists upon stretching
clear plastic food wrap

01:04.522 --> 01:07.525
over the toilets in the women's john.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.446
-(all laughing)
-Oh, so funny.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.700
PHIL:
Guys, we all appreciate a practical joke,

01:15.784 --> 01:20.997
but really, health-wise, hygiene-wise
and dry cleaning-wise,

01:21.539 --> 01:24.084
let's keep our food wrap where it belongs.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.335
WOMAN: Right.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.046
-MAN: On the sandwiches.
-PHIL: Item ten.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.925
-Training officer duty.
-(all groaning)

01:32.008 --> 01:33.468
By that response, I see you're all aware

01:33.551 --> 01:36.763
of the recent abolition
of the full-time training officer post,

01:37.222 --> 01:40.725
due to the ongoing city government's
austerity programs.

01:41.309 --> 01:46.523
Therefore, the following patrol officers
will be assigned one new transfer each.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.982
(all groaning)

01:48.066 --> 01:51.486
And it'll be their job
to indoctrinate said transfers

01:51.569 --> 01:53.655
into the machinations of the Hill.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.407
Vermaine, Harris, Hill, Renko.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.077
(all groaning)

01:59.160 --> 02:02.664
-(chattering)
-PHIL: The, uh, last item.

02:04.124 --> 02:09.504
The last item is a special communiqué
from the Police Association...

02:10.004 --> 02:11.631
negotiating team.

02:11.714 --> 02:15.343
-If I ever get a--
-I quote: "As of 11:49 last night,

02:15.426 --> 02:19.973
all negotiations between the city
and the association are suspended."

02:20.056 --> 02:21.724
-What?
-(all muttering)

02:21.808 --> 02:22.684
Already?

02:22.767 --> 02:25.937
"The reasons for this drastic action
are as follows.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.942
When presented with our new demands
regarding pension and retirement benefits,

02:31.025 --> 02:33.778
the city council responded, 'No.'"

02:33.862 --> 02:35.446
(all muttering)

02:35.530 --> 02:37.740
"When presented
with the upgraded health package,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.119
including the highly
sought-after dental plan,

02:41.202 --> 02:44.455
the city council's response was, 'No!'"

02:44.539 --> 02:45.957
(all muttering)

02:46.040 --> 02:48.710
"When presented with our keynote demands,

02:48.793 --> 02:51.963
wage-wise, fringe-wise
and cost-of-living-wise,

02:52.046 --> 02:55.717
the city council--" and I quote,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.888
"...laughed in our faces."

02:59.971 --> 03:03.099
(all shouting)

03:03.183 --> 03:04.809
Why should I even go out there then?

03:04.893 --> 03:06.686
PHIL: Laughed in our faces!

03:06.769 --> 03:08.813
(chattering)

03:08.897 --> 03:10.273
All right. All right.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.776
Let's roll. And hey.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.072
Now, let's be damn careful out there.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.741
-MAN: Let a councilman take the--
-(indistinct)

03:19.824 --> 03:21.910
RENKO: Bust your butt
all the time out there...

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Dispatch.</i>
<i>We have a 9-11.</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:26.581
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:26.664 --> 03:30.543
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:40.637
(theme music playing)

04:42.865 --> 04:45.118
Hey, hey. Come on, man.
Have a heart. I'm blind.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.203
-Belker.
-I'm telling you. I'm totally blind.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.081
Inside, nosebag.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.874
It's intermittent.
It happens every once in a while.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.252
-Move! Move!
-I swear. I swear.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.380
You work your butt off
trying to compile a decent record,

04:57.463 --> 04:58.548
and how do they treat ya?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.718
Do they promote ya? No.
Do they get you in plainclothes? No.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.095
Do they let you work for a decent wage?
No.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.179
You go out on strike,

05:05.263 --> 05:06.597
and then they take you away
from your partner

05:06.681 --> 05:08.182
and make you into a tour guide.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.600
Well, it's only for two days.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.270
Besides, it'll do me good
to get a rest from you.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.272
-What?
-Let's go find our new partners.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.732
You're lookin' at yours, pal.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.859
-Jerry Nash!
-Hey. How you doin'?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.694
-How in the hell are you?
-Great.

05:19.777 --> 05:23.531
Say, Renko. Jerry Nash. I used to work
with this guy down at Jefferson Heights.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.366
Well, that's just peachy, Bobby.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.660
You get old home week,
and I'll probably end up

05:27.744 --> 05:31.122
playing Captain Kangaroo
to some wide-eyed mental defective

05:31.205 --> 05:32.623
straight off the turnip truck.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.417
-Officer Renko?
-Yeah.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.045
I'm Estella Sanchez.
I believe you're my T.O.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.465
Andrew J., ma'am.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.927
Uh, and I'm here to protect and serve you
for the next two days.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.889
Maybe, uh, we could get together
out here in the hallway

05:47.972 --> 05:50.016
and I could explain just how productive...

05:50.099 --> 05:51.225
-I'll catch up with you
-...the next two days are gonna be.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.518
All right.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.688
Coffey, Bates.
Outbreak of domestic strife.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.691
1175 Richmond Avenue, apartment 4-D.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.487
-(knocks)
-Hey, Frank.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.281
-You got a minute?
-You bet.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
-I was going out there to find you.
-I just don't know

06:07.575 --> 06:09.952
if you realize how much
I appreciate what you did for me.

06:10.036 --> 06:10.953
It's nothing.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.164
Internal Affairs had the rope out for me,
Frank.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.416
-And if you hadn't done what you did--
-I don't think so, Jerry.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.169
I think they know what kind of pressure
you've been under since Annie died.

06:18.461 --> 06:22.298
Well, anyway, you wield a heavy bat
in this league, Frank.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.050
I want you to know I won't forget it.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.057
Well, looks like my T.O.'s gettin' antsy.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.059
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you later.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.685
-Huh?
-No, no, no. Leave it.

06:44.821 --> 06:48.116
-MAN: I told you to shut up!
-(woman shouting)

06:48.199 --> 06:51.577
-We gotta get in there. Come on.
-(shouting continues)

06:51.661 --> 06:53.704
-(woman shouting)
-What do you guys want?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.748
Look. I'm gonna have
to ask you to settle down.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.666
Hey.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.294
I'm gonna swat you in the mouth!
You understand? I'm gonna slap you silly!

07:00.378 --> 07:02.296
Look, sir. We're just trying
to be reasonable. Don't start--

07:02.380 --> 07:04.632
Reasonable? With this meatball?
How can you be reasonable?

07:04.715 --> 07:07.510
You shut up. I'm gonna slap your mouth
down your throat! Understand?

07:07.593 --> 07:11.514
-Go ahead! Go ahead!
-Hey, hey, hey. Just relax. Please.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.058
Look what he brings home last night.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.101
-MAN: Ah.
-Look at this.

07:15.184 --> 07:18.062
"Jackie. 2743 Elmwood Avenue."

07:18.146 --> 07:21.315
It's Jackie. Jackie DeCarlo.
He's a friend of mine.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.736
He bowls. He drinks. He's got hair
on his palms like one of the guys.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.156
-You liar! You liar!
-I told you--

07:28.239 --> 07:30.283
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Jackie DeCarlo?

07:30.950 --> 07:31.909
A big guy.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.495
-Big thick neck with a lot of body hair?
-Yeah.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.330
Yeah. He's got a tattoo
up here on his arm?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.874
Yeah. Yeah.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.083
Ma'am, I grew up in this neighborhood.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.626
-I know Jackie DeCarlo.
-MAN: Yeah.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.421
I used to, uh, shoot pool with him
at the Deuce Ex.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.506
-Yeah. Great guy.
-Nice guy.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.179
(sighs) Do you mean that?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.639
Why would I lie about Jackie DeCarlo?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.683
See? You see?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.356
Oh, Vito. I'm sorry.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.775
Oh, Vito. I'm sorry, baby.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.152
-WOMAN: Forgive me.
-VITO: Seriously.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.571
-I'm sorry.
-I forgive you.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.906
-I love you. You're the only one.
-Oh.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.449
Let 'em make up in private.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.787
-How can I do that to you? Oh.
-(door closes)

08:16.871 --> 08:20.500
-(chattering)
-Very creative stuff, Joe.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.128
-What?
-"What?" "I know Jackie DeCarlo.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.963
Lot of body hair.
Used to play pool with him."

08:26.047 --> 08:27.882
-Who you kiddin'?
-Hey. Come on. It worked, right?

08:27.965 --> 08:29.675
-Oh, it worked.
-Besides, what's the harm?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.345
Guys like Vito, they have
a couple of beers after work.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.722
-Yeah. Uh-huh.
-They buy a little tomato a drink.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.599
Maybe squeeze a little flesh
under the barstool.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.100
Then they go home to their old ladies.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.227
-What's the big deal?
-You know something?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.229
I am real glad to see
that under that uniform

08:41.312 --> 08:43.356
is just a swell, old-fashioned guy.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.237
Hey, Luce. See this place?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.155
I spent nearly every Friday night

08:51.239 --> 08:53.449
in junior high hanging out
in front of this joint.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.742
You did?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.954
Yeah. It was me and Vinnie Scalese

08:58.871 --> 09:00.957
and Rocco "Six Fingers" Mangotti.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.210
-You would have loved this guy.
-A real classy guy.

09:06.462 --> 09:10.716
-You really miss this place, huh?
-Ah.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.054
You know, after my father died,
my mother sold the house.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.099
Yeah. I guess I do. A little bit.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.643
(chattering on police radio)

09:21.602 --> 09:22.853
COFFEY: Hey. There's Guido Barbari.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.107
He used to rent a room from my aunt.
Worked at the cleaners near our house.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.483
Hey! Guido!

09:29.569 --> 09:32.572
(chattering on police radio)

09:33.239 --> 09:34.323
Guido.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.618
"Hey," what?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.829
What do you mean,
"'Hey,' what"? It's me. Joseph.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.290
Nah. It can't be.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.375
The only Joseph I know is Joe Coffey,

09:44.458 --> 09:46.961
and he don't bother to visit
the old neighborhood no more.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.922
He's got one of those "swingles" apartment
on the north side,

09:50.006 --> 09:52.216
and he forgot
about all us dagos down here.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.385
Hey. Come on.
You gonna break my arches, or what?

09:54.468 --> 09:58.180
The only time I hear from this bum
is when he scares his aunt half to death

09:58.264 --> 10:00.975
-and he gets shot or something.
-COFFEY: Come on. That was nothin'.

10:01.058 --> 10:04.770
Nothin'"? "Nothin'," he says.
I know this bum since he's this high.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.189
-Yeah. He's like one of my own.
-Oh!

10:07.273 --> 10:08.733
-Come on.
-(laughing)

10:08.816 --> 10:11.611
Ah! You're lookin' good, Joseph.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.031
I'm lookin' good? Look at you.
You look like the next Mario Lanza.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.576
$400 suits. Custom-made shirt.
What'd you do? Rob a bank?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.411
What is it? Against the law or somethin'?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.371
COFFEY: Hey. You got your own
business now, or what?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.041
GUIDO: What is this?<i> What's My Line, </i>huh?

10:25.124 --> 10:27.710
Hey. A guy can't put
on a decent set of threads

10:27.793 --> 10:30.504
without you making like
a one-man Kefauver commission.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.382
No, no. I'm just really surprised
to see you looking so good.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.217
I mean, you're, uh, really decked.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.304
Why shouldn't I be? Because I worked
behind a counter one time? Ah?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.680
-Hey.
-Imagine this kid

10:39.764 --> 10:42.266
talkin' to me like I'm a hardship case
or somethin'.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.811
-And after the way I helped his family.
-What do you mean?

10:45.895 --> 10:49.273
How'd you help my family, Guido?
I mean, you rented a room from my aunt.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.528
Who... who do you think kept your father's
business out of bankruptcy, huh? Who?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.989
Bankruptcy? What are you talkin' about?

10:57.531 --> 10:59.742
When my father died,
I checked the family records.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.327
You never gave him any money.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.621
Records. Records. What records? Huh?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.456
You think friends
carry papers on each other?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.249
And all I did for his father.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.794
And that's the respect I get from the son.

11:09.877 --> 11:10.920
Guido, come on.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
And you think I gotta stand here
and take this.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.342
Huh? You think that, huh?

11:16.425 --> 11:19.095
-Hey. (speaks Italian)
-You watch.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.140
It's a fine respect.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.811
MAN: Come on. Come on.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.981
He never gave my father a dime.

11:33.651 --> 11:38.447
You, uh, you get into some kind of beef
over at Jefferson Heights?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.075
One or two.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.455
-(sighs) They had this captain, Villicoff.
-Mm-hmm.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.210
We had what you might call
your basic personality conflict.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.547
Oh. You didn't exactly see eye to eye
with the man, huh?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.091
Couldn't bend over that far.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.222
-Hey, Bobby.
-Mm-hmm?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.600
I know it's a little late, but, uh,

12:07.977 --> 12:10.521
thanks for the flowers after Annie died.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.191
I never did get around
to sending out cards.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.403
No big deal.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.991
-How you makin' out with your kids?
-Great.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.493
Hey. Did I tell you?
I'm goin' to night school.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.870
-No.
-Yeah.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.497
I'm two years into
a bachelor's degree in accountancy.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.667
-Gonna be a CPA.
-Wow.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.919
How in the world do you manage
to get all that in a day?

12:34.003 --> 12:37.131
DISPATCHER (on radio):
<i>Unit, 714 on the corner of 12th</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:38.883
<i>and Hyacinth. Code 3.</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:43.012
That's us. Unit 18 acknowledge
and will proceed.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.765
(siren wailing)

12:45.848 --> 12:48.684
-(screaming) Help!
-(siren wailing)

12:54.982 --> 12:57.860
-(tires screech)
-(siren stops)

12:59.028 --> 13:01.989
-(screaming)
-Hey there, lady!

13:02.072 --> 13:05.075
(screaming continues)

13:05.159 --> 13:07.620
-Stuck.
-Hey. (coughs) We got a burner.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.413
-(screaming continues)
-You got an extinguisher?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.208
-No. Mine got stolen. I'll call for help.
-Keep your head down.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.669
(screaming continues)

13:18.047 --> 13:19.340
Get your head down.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.760
Come on!

13:27.556 --> 13:28.724
I got her.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.936
(sirens wailing)

13:32.394 --> 13:33.562
-Here. You got her?
-Yeah.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.689
(sirens wailing)

13:41.862 --> 13:43.656
(sirens stop)

13:45.616 --> 13:48.202
-(grunting)
-(chattering)

13:48.285 --> 13:50.246
-JERRY: Damn.
-Get out of there, Jerry.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.288
She's gonna blow!

13:51.372 --> 13:53.249
(grunts)

13:53.332 --> 13:55.209
(chattering)

13:55.292 --> 13:57.545
I got ya, buddy. I got ya.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.632
It's okay. I got ya. I got ya.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.511
(screaming, shouting)

14:11.100 --> 14:12.685
-(coughing)
-Your hand, man. It's hurt bad.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.436
-Are you all right?
-No. I'm fine.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.985
Hey, man. I'd send that one back
to the chef. He ain't cooked enough.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.571
(laughing)

14:23.654 --> 14:24.655
-Jerry! Jerry!
-(shouting)

14:24.738 --> 14:27.616
Come on! Ease up, man! Let him go!

14:27.700 --> 14:31.120
Jerry. Come on, man.
Forget it. Just forget it.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.454
-WOMAN: Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.873
Let's go see about that hand.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.833
-Come on.
-I'm okay.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.751
MAN: Lousy cop! Pig!

14:38.460 --> 14:39.628
(siren wailing)

14:51.849 --> 14:55.561
Well, right over here we have, uh,
Hymie's Deluxe Cafeteria.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.897
It's a real chicken hawk place.
Little boys and all.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.399
It's real slime with a capital "S."

15:00.774 --> 15:02.276
Don't get me wrong, Estella.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.653
I love these streets,
and these streets love me.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.071
That's what it takes to do

15:06.155 --> 15:08.824
real outstanding police
"officorial" work up here.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.327
Aside from all this reciprocal love,

15:12.036 --> 15:14.747
what other kind of action
do you generally see around here?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.040
Well,

15:16.624 --> 15:19.418
I've been shot at, stabbed,
hit with a ball peen hammer,

15:19.501 --> 15:21.670
called names you wouldn't even
know what they meant.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.505
Have you really been shot?

15:25.090 --> 15:25.925
Yeah.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.887
Do you want to see?
Uh, I'll pull over in this alley here

15:29.970 --> 15:31.305
and show you if you want me to.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.933
If you don't mind, Renko,
I'd rather just cruise the area.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.685
I got an awful lot
to soak up in just two days.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.855
And soak up you shall.

15:39.939 --> 15:45.110
Now, right over here
is your basic kill-or-be-killed bar.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.404
They throw a body out there
about once a week.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.114
(gasps) Oh. Will you look over there?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.240
I'm gonna take care of something
right now.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.784
I got some business to tend to.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.955
-(horn honking)
-(gasps) Watch out.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.880
All right. Didn't I tell you two insect,
lice-ridden social defects

16:04.964 --> 16:08.342
that the next time I saw you out
on the street I was gonna run you in?

16:08.759 --> 16:10.177
-Who are they, Renko?
-Who are they?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.720
They're the scum of the earth.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.182
-They are chump-chuckin', fleabag, lice...
-Oh, now--

16:15.265 --> 16:18.352
Get up! Get in there. Get over there
and assume the position. I mean that, boy.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.854
-Get over there. (shouting)
-I was--

16:20.938 --> 16:23.148
Will you go over and assume the position?
Thank you.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.359
All right.
Now, you kick the leg out like that.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.694
Then you're gonna search 'em,
and I'll watch. Go ahead.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.736
I know he gonna shoot us.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.781
(laughing) I can't stand it.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.074
You're not supposed to make him laugh.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.535
-It's supposed to hurt.
-Run, man. Run. (laughing)

16:34.618 --> 16:37.997
I can't stand it. I gotta get out of here!

16:38.080 --> 16:41.208
-Come back.
-(gasping)

16:43.085 --> 16:45.462
-(gasping)
-Lord have mercy.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.716
Oh! (groaning)

16:50.843 --> 16:52.928
-RENKO: What did you do?
-I didn't do anything.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.432
Oh, Lord. She done killed him,
Mr. Renko. She done killed Lance.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.601
Oh, my Lord.
Looks like old Lance here's dead.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.646
I'm gonna go call the paramedics,
and you just give him some mouth-to-mouth.

17:02.730 --> 17:07.776
Wait. Instead of the paramedics,
why not the mouth-to-mouth?

17:07.860 --> 17:11.280
(laughing)

17:14.199 --> 17:18.162
-Oh, my Lord. Ah! You--
-(laughing)

17:20.831 --> 17:23.876
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful, Neal.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.420
Some training officer.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.048
-Oh, Lance.
-I tell you...

17:29.131 --> 17:31.675
That was almost as good as the time we...

17:31.759 --> 17:33.969
(laughing)

17:34.053 --> 17:35.512
-(tires squeal)
-Hey. Hey.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.975
She took my car. She stole the car.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.730
-Oh, Lord!
-(laughing)

17:45.189 --> 17:47.483
-Sorry.
-What was the city council's final offer?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.819
Lieutenant, I know
this should go to the sergeant,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.696
but as a fellow Latino, I thought you--

17:54.198 --> 17:55.616
Okay, Sanchez. What do you want?

17:55.699 --> 17:57.534
A new training officer.
That's what I want.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.120
-I can't work with Renko.
-No dental plan.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.289
Damn. What about the pay hike?

18:02.372 --> 18:05.084
Look, Lieutenant. If you don't have
the staff, just give me another unit.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.877
I'll learn the area on my own.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.588
Four percent cost of living tops?

18:09.671 --> 18:12.800
-Are they crazy? That's a joke.
-Lieutenant.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.596
Look, Sanchez. I'll have the sergeant
assign you to temporary office duty. Okay?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.474
-People are testing my patience.
-What did you hear?

18:20.557 --> 18:23.143
They're talking a possible wildcat strike.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.770
<i>iMadre mía!</i>

18:24.853 --> 18:28.107
Just another light-loafered step
on the road to socialism.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.193
-Excuse me, Howard?
-Judas Priest, Ray.

18:31.276 --> 18:36.156
Those union wags have got cream of wheat
where their bone marrow ought to be.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.034
Can you imagine what kind
of a republic this would be

18:39.118 --> 18:41.829
if civil employees were allowed to strike

18:41.912 --> 18:44.832
every time a dental plan
dropped a molar or two?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.584
I am talkin' garbage in the streets.

18:47.668 --> 18:52.381
The<i> Pravda </i>in every newsstand
and a goldarn land bridge to Cuba.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.258
Howard, what choice have we got?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.635
No choice.<i> Mon ami</i>.

18:56.718 --> 19:00.180
Let's all take our blues
and put 'em in mothballs.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.142
Then we'll just climb into some warm PJs

19:03.225 --> 19:06.520
and, uh, play pinochle
for the rest of the fiscal year,

19:07.646 --> 19:13.443
while 45,000 of your brown types
go on a discount shopping spree.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.863
Would you like to repeat that, Lieutenant?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.615
-(phone rings)
-Excuse me, Captain.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.202
Are we having a problem here, gentlemen?

19:22.286 --> 19:27.207
Well, uh, some of us seem to be overly
concerned with our dental plan, Frank.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.169
Some of the guys are talking
about a possible walkout, Frank.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.045
-Who have you been talking to?
-Captain.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.799
(clears throat) Captain, have you got
a minute to spare for the missus?

19:36.049 --> 19:38.927
-Tell her to call back, would you, Leo?
-Sorry, Captain, but, she's, uh--

19:39.011 --> 19:41.305
Tell her I'm out.
Tell her anything, but, Leo--

19:42.222 --> 19:44.808
See what I've had to put up
with for the last 12 years?

19:45.976 --> 19:49.021
-Frank, I want you to meet--
-Hal Massey. Pleasure.

19:49.104 --> 19:52.691
Well, that goes double for me too,
Frank. Listen. By the way, use this.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.068
Ah.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.239
(clears throat)

20:01.658 --> 20:02.659
Thank you.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.538
Uh, would you like to come in my office?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.960
(indistinct chatter)

20:15.589 --> 20:17.758
Fine-looking gentleman, Hal Massey.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.219
And I suppose Francis isn't?

20:20.969 --> 20:23.013
Well, um,

20:23.305 --> 20:27.893
Frank, I am speaking tomorrow at a, uh,
fund-raiser luncheon at the Statler.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.562
Now, Fay and I have discussed this
already, and...

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
we both would really like you to come.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.567
(stammers) Uh, I don't know, Hal.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.445
I'm, uh, I'm pretty pressed around here
right now, you know.

20:38.528 --> 20:42.449
Oh, Frank, we thought this would be just
an excellent opportunity for you to learn

20:42.532 --> 20:46.328
where Hal stands on the issues affecting
those of us with school-age children.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.580
I mean, especially
since he's going to be stepping in

20:48.664 --> 20:51.416
as father figure for Frank Jr.
in just five days.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.168
(clears throat)
Unless I'm terribly mistaken,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.087
Frank Jr. already has a father figure.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.214
He has a damn good father figure, Frank.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.841
Oh, Frank. Uh, there's
no need to get defensive.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.887
All I meant was that since Hal
is going to be a constant in his life,

21:03.971 --> 21:06.974
I mean, Frank Jr.'s bound to pick up
some of his values.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.727
May I remind you both that since I intend
to remain a constant in my son's life,

21:10.811 --> 21:13.313
he's bound to retain
a hell of a lot of my values.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.856
Frank, listen.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.360
Believe me, nothing is going to change
between you and little Frank.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.738
-His name is Frank Jr.
-FAY: Well, excuse me, mister,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.408
but it's very hard to tell whose name
is Frank Jr. here

21:24.491 --> 21:25.409
from the way you're behaving.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.202
-Fay, please.
-No.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.996
Now, this just isn't fair.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.789
Uh, Fay, you're right.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.459
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry. It's... It's not. And, uh...

21:36.211 --> 21:38.171
I apologize.
I don't know why I'm behaving like this.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.090
Things have been pretty tense
around here lately.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.928
Listen. If I had to spend 50 hours a day
in a place like this,

21:45.012 --> 21:46.972
-I would be tense too.
-(chuckles)

21:47.055 --> 21:48.682
-(intercom buzzes)
-Excuse me.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.478
(clears throat) Yeah. Furillo.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.939
MAN:<i> Yeah, Captain.</i>
<i>There's a blue Monte Carlo--</i>

21:56.023 --> 21:57.441
Mm-hmm.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.569
Yeah. I think I do.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.572
-No, no, no. Good. Yeah.
-MAN:<i> Okay.</i>

22:03.947 --> 22:04.948
Thanks.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.950
Uh, Hal.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.245
Do you own a blue Monte Carlo?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.497
Yes, I do, Frank. Why?

22:13.457 --> 22:16.668
It's being cited for parking
in the red zone out front.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.504
-What?
-Oh, God. (chuckles)

22:20.297 --> 22:22.007
Fay, I told you we couldn't park there.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.594
Well, I have always parked there,
and there's never been any problem.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.764
I'm not in the habit of,
uh, fixing tickets,

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
but in this case I'd be glad
to make an exception.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.189
-Thank you.
-It's all right.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.525
So, Frank, will you come?

22:41.735 --> 22:43.028
Please.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.282
-Sure. I'd be happy to.
-Oh.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.117
-All right.
-Good.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.285
We'll see you tomorrow.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.614
Where you get your cologne, Belker?
Waste treatment plant?

23:28.031 --> 23:30.700
(growls)

23:33.495 --> 23:36.039
You're gonna look awful funny
minus a nose, baby.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.667
Better minus that than some things
I can think of.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.337
-Mm.
-Mm. You hear from your old lady?

23:42.712 --> 23:45.048
Yeah. She called me last night from L.A.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.759
That dude she made
this commercial with last month?

23:47.843 --> 23:48.844
Mm-hmm.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.221
-Says she could do real well out there.
-Hmm.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.472
Yeah, sure.

23:52.556 --> 23:56.101
Up to her earlobes in his hot tub
with the quiche and freebase set.

23:56.184 --> 23:59.020
-Hey. You know Jill better than that, man.
-Come on, Neal. Hey.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.898
It's none of my business,
right, but Hollywood?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.818
Man, those guys'll
just be all over that chick.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.404
Hey, hey. The lady's got career plans.
Okay, J.D.?

24:08.321 --> 24:09.489
Besides, man,

24:09.865 --> 24:11.950
-when you really care for someone...
-Mm-hmm.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.911
...that self-fulfillment supersedes
all those petty jealousies.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.542
Hold the meringue, huh?
I'm gettin' diabetes.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.553
Oh. Miss, my friend here,

24:31.636 --> 24:35.849
he'll have the sewage surprise
and the human hand for dessert.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.398
Could I have an empty glass
and a sandwich setup, please?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.150
What kind of sandwich is that?

24:45.233 --> 24:47.194
Oh, it's not a sandwich.
It's a sandwich setup.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.945
Doris always gets it for me.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.867
Tell you what you do.
Bring me a kaiser roll,

24:53.950 --> 24:57.162
a nice thick slice of Bermuda onion
and a piece of cabbage, all right?

24:58.663 --> 25:00.957
That's it? No pastrami or ham or nothin'?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.793
Uh, no. Not unless
you got these on the menu.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
Oh, God.

25:10.884 --> 25:15.096
Three weeks ago, my new housekeeper comes
to me and tells me she wants a raise.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.266
I tell her I'm already busted,
so she splits.

25:19.434 --> 25:22.729
And on top of everything, I hear
the union's walkin' out of negotiations.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.899
I'm already overextended as it is.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.860
A strike now is really
gonna put me in the toilet.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.531
It's not easy for any of us, Jerry.
Besides, what else can we do, huh?

25:33.323 --> 25:36.868
If we don't get their attention,
they don't even take us seriously.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.288
I got my oldest at home now,
lookin' after the baby.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.166
She'll be flunking out of school
because of it.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.461
Ah. Better give her a call.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.051
I mean, where does this guy get off
spreadin' lies

25:53.134 --> 25:54.678
around the neighborhood like that?

25:54.761 --> 25:55.804
I don't know.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.100
It was my old man
who was always helpin' out Guido.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.270
-Car loans, Christmas money.
-(register bell dings)

26:03.353 --> 26:07.524
COFFEY: You know, he once borrowed
500 bucks from my old man back in 1966,

26:07.607 --> 26:09.025
and he hasn't paid it back yet.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.737
Look, Joe. I know this union thing
is gettin' everybody tense,

26:12.821 --> 26:14.239
but I really think
you're lettin' it get to you.

26:14.322 --> 26:15.156
How's Christopher?

26:15.240 --> 26:16.366
COFFEY:
The union has nothin' to do with it.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.993
Did you take him outside?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.870
Guido Barbari was somethin' special to me.

26:21.454 --> 26:22.872
He was like part of my family.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.667
I used to bring him beers

26:25.750 --> 26:28.920
when he used to watch the fights
with my father on Friday nights.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.506
COFFEY: Guido used to give me a penny tip.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.217
Now he's bad-rappin' my old man,

26:34.467 --> 26:36.011
he's hangin' around
with these shady characters,

26:36.094 --> 26:38.930
and he's handlin' small talk
like it was the third degree.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.349
Now, that's... that's not Guido.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.184
None of it.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.980
What? What?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.233
I'm sorry, baby. I can't hear ya.

26:50.317 --> 26:54.321
It's very noisy in here.
You'll have to speak up some. No. Don't--

26:55.030 --> 26:57.741
Baby, if I've told you once,
I've told you a hundred times.

26:57.824 --> 27:02.078
You have to check the disposal
for dishcloths before you turn it on!

27:02.662 --> 27:05.415
You can put your hand down it
as long as you don't turn it on!

27:05.790 --> 27:08.710
Do you have any idea how much
a plumber's gonna gouge us for this?

27:09.586 --> 27:10.670
Huh?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.716
You wait till I get home, young lady.
You just wait.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.134
(handset slams)

27:28.521 --> 27:30.899
-(baby crying)
-(people shouting)

27:30.982 --> 27:34.069
Joe, I think we really better stick
with police business.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.445
I don't think you should do--

27:35.904 --> 27:38.698
Look, Luce. I'm sorry. I can't work
when I'm feelin' like this.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.076
-I couldn't even finish my lunch.
-Yeah. Me either.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.246
Eee, Maria. When it rains, it pours.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.916
-Why don't you call first, Joey?
-We gotta talk, Guido.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.335
Later, all right? Later.
Look. Mrs. Spinelli's here.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.295
It'd be a big scandal
if the people found out.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.213
He's got a point.

27:53.296 --> 27:56.299
I don't care if the pope himself
is visiting. I want to talk to you.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.052
(security chain clinks)

28:00.720 --> 28:02.639
Look, Joseph. About your father--

28:02.722 --> 28:05.600
Forget I said anything.
I was only kiddin' around. (chuckles)

28:05.684 --> 28:06.685
See? There you go.
It's settled. That's it.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.729
Look. There's something going on with you,
and I want to know what.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.022
What are you talkin' about?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.441
I'm talkin' about a guy
I've known my entire life

28:13.525 --> 28:15.527
who's walkin' around in these $400 suits

28:15.610 --> 28:18.071
and actin' like he's some big mob guy
or somethin'.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.365
-That's what I'm talkin' about.
-You're imagining things, Joseph.

28:20.448 --> 28:23.660
Nothing's going on with me.
I swear. I swear.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.080
Hey,
Guido! There ain't no size-- Holy sh--

28:27.664 --> 28:29.165
Mrs. Spinelli, huh?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.796
-What is this?
-MAN:<i> Polizia.</i>

28:35.088 --> 28:36.423
What the hell's goin' on here?

28:36.673 --> 28:39.008
My apartment was overflowing.
I had to get rid of some stuff.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.470
-There's no problem. Keep shopping.
-This is all new merchandise.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.639
You got a bill of sale for this stuff?

28:46.266 --> 28:47.767
You got anything you can show me?

28:47.851 --> 28:51.312
Come on, Joey boy.
It's all taken care of.<i> Capisce</i>?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.898
No<i> "capisce." </i>What are you talkin' about?

28:53.982 --> 28:57.026
-Where'd you get the stuff?
-I got connections, sweetheart.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.737
Let's just let it go at that.

28:59.821 --> 29:03.074
Is this stuff hot?
Is that what you're tryin' to tell me?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.951
You're wastin' your time, kid.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.078
Look, Guido. You better give me some
answers real quick,

29:07.162 --> 29:09.372
or I swear to God,
I'm gonna run you in, I mean it.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.791
Joseph Coffey,
you oughta be ashamed of yourself.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.043
Mrs. Amico, please, stay out of this.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.587
This is your last chance, Guido.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.715
In 1958,
your family would have went bankrupt

29:18.798 --> 29:21.801
'cause your papa didn't know
how to run his business.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.137
But Guido here bailed you out.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.765
-Wha... What are friends for, huh?
-Yeah.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.934
That's it. I'm gonna run you in, Guido.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.561
Where's your coat? Hey, Luce.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.564
We're gonna take all this stuff with us.
Come on. Get your coat.

29:37.525 --> 29:41.571
-Ooh, nice weave.
-Wool worsted, 100 percent.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.659
BATES: Just, uh, keep movin'.

29:47.702 --> 29:50.038
Hey, Luce. Did you have to arrest
this wardrobe too?

29:51.790 --> 29:54.793
Renko, may I have a word with you? Hmm?

29:55.919 --> 29:57.253
MAN: How many did you take?

29:59.130 --> 30:02.717
Frank, did you have a chance to read
Hill's report yet?

30:02.801 --> 30:06.387
Oh, yeah. Looks as if Jerry Nash
will be nominated for Medal of Valor.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.431
I want to talk to you about that,
soon as you have a moment.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.724
All right.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.062
Ah, you know,
without putting too fine a point on it,

30:14.145 --> 30:16.356
this Sanchez woman
was more than somewhat upset

30:16.439 --> 30:18.983
about your curbside theatricalities
this morning.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.860
So she came in here
and kicked up a ruckus, didn't she?

30:20.944 --> 30:23.738
Mm-hmm. I sent her out with Perez
and Ellis for the rest of the day.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.282
She's threatening to file
harassment claims.

30:26.991 --> 30:30.161
Come on, Sarge. It's a practical joke.
A lot of new fish get gooned.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.288
-You know that.
-Nevertheless, I'm sure you can appreciate

30:32.372 --> 30:37.043
a certain sensitivity on her part to these
atavistic traditions,

30:37.293 --> 30:39.504
minority-and gender-wise as it were.

30:39.879 --> 30:43.049
She's a fine officer.
She wants desperately to fit in.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.468
She was terribly hurt.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.517
(stammers) I didn't mean to do anything.
I just...

30:57.814 --> 31:00.650
Sarge, I've been feeling
real distracted lately.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.527
You know what I mean?
Even Bobby's been seein' it.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.364
I feel like I'm caught in some kind
of weird downward spiral, you know.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.033
Well, it's a high-stress
occupation, Andrew.

31:09.659 --> 31:13.997
This whole job walkout stuff is blowin'
all my plans half to hell.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.166
I gotta lose 16
pounds in three and a half weeks,

31:17.250 --> 31:18.209
or I won't pass my physical.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.504
I'm 31 years old. I haven't even applied
for the sergeant test.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.048
(stammers) You know, I'm, I... I'm...

31:26.759 --> 31:27.844
(sighs)

31:29.178 --> 31:30.930
(sighs)

31:33.099 --> 31:36.644
Sarge, I never in my life meant
to hurt that little lady.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.605
I know that. Don't feel too bad.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.067
It's not easy maintaining harmony
in a job such as ours.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.654
Well, you sure as hell
seem to do a good job of it.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.781
Well, I've been at it over 20 years.

31:48.865 --> 31:52.619
And in that time I've come to see
the precinct house for what it really is,

31:52.702 --> 31:56.497
a tenuously balanced social microcosm,

31:56.873 --> 32:00.752
composed of highly diverse
and competitive individuals.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.214
Now, without some sensitivity
to their various dispositions

32:05.298 --> 32:07.258
there'd be absolute chaos.

32:08.259 --> 32:12.096
Ray, if it's not too much trouble,
will you file these, please?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.557
I beg your pardon, Phil?

32:14.641 --> 32:18.102
Well, I'm up to my hips in a serious
tête-à-tête with Officer Renko,

32:18.186 --> 32:20.271
and I was wondering if you could file
these for me.

32:20.355 --> 32:24.400
I realize budget tightening has forced us
to lose several clerks,

32:24.484 --> 32:28.279
but nevertheless, there are still
appropriate channels for filing.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.366
Oh, I see. Perhaps I should
have, uh, asked someone

32:31.449 --> 32:35.036
of a slightly lower rank
than lieutenant, Lieutenant.

32:35.828 --> 32:39.540
That would have been more in line
with established procedures, Sergeant!

32:39.624 --> 32:45.421
Well, forgive me for thinking that favors
between friends required procedure.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.881
I don't believe this.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.217
Negotiations hit a snag,
and you two are at each other's throats.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.134
Well, the sergeant was--

32:50.218 --> 32:53.554
Sarge, shots fired, 112th
and Maplewood. Probable homicide.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.390
-Hill and Nash responding.
-That's two blocks.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.518
-We'll need backups--
-Coffey, Bates, Renko, go.

32:58.601 --> 32:59.686
Thank you.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.063
(sirens wailing)

33:06.859 --> 33:08.861
-(tires screech)
-(sirens stop)

33:09.570 --> 33:11.030
(dog barking)

33:14.993 --> 33:16.577
(chattering)

33:16.661 --> 33:18.538
(shouting)

33:18.621 --> 33:22.750
(shouting in Spanish)

33:28.214 --> 33:30.383
-Police! Drop everything!
-Hold it right now!

33:30.466 --> 33:32.135
-What are you talkin' about?
-I got 'em.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.720
Stop! Drop the bottle!

33:37.223 --> 33:38.182
I got ya.

33:38.891 --> 33:42.520
-Who you pushin', pig?
-I'm pushin' you!

33:44.564 --> 33:45.773
-MAN: Help!
-Jerry!

33:45.857 --> 33:49.318
Help! Oh, man! He's gonna kill me!

33:49.402 --> 33:51.029
Jerry! Jerry! Stop it, man. Stop it!

33:51.487 --> 33:54.615
Jerry, you're gonna kill him, man.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.997
Jerry, what's the matter, man?

34:03.124 --> 34:05.626
I'm okay. (panting)

34:15.595 --> 34:17.138
MAN: Move along.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.390
Bobby, Nash.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.644
Captain wants to see you in his office.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.941
I may need your help now, Bobby.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.249
-How's your suspect?
-(door closes)

34:45.333 --> 34:46.501
We left him at County.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.546
-Condition?
-He got a little hurt, Frank.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.508
Doctor said there's a possible concussion.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.301
JERRY: They're taking X-rays.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.179
He mentioned something
about a couple of ribs too.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.431
You want to run it down for me?

35:01.015 --> 35:03.059
We pursued the suspect down a hallway.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.144
He threw a bottle at me.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.397
-Where were you, Bobby?
-Bobby was behind me.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.192
Uh... (clears throat)

35:11.651 --> 35:14.529
About eight to ten, uh, steps, Captain.

35:14.946 --> 35:15.863
And then?

35:16.405 --> 35:20.368
I grabbed the suspect
as he was going out the fire escape.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.413
He was high on something.
He popped me in the eye.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.333
What steps did you take to control him?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.544
It was an escalating force thing.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.673
He was goin' crazy,
like angel dust or somethin'.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.592
He popped me in the eye. I popped him.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.470
I tried for an arm restraint,
but forget it.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.182
Uh, he kept resisting,

35:44.016 --> 35:46.185
I cracked him with the baton,
and that was it.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.105
(thunder rumbling)

35:49.188 --> 35:51.482
Did any other officers strike any blows?

35:51.858 --> 35:52.733
JERRY: No.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.111
Is that how it happened, Bobby?

35:57.572 --> 36:01.200
That's about it, Captain.
It was reasonable and necessary.

36:02.076 --> 36:06.581
I want 592s from everybody who saw
anything on my desk by 9:00 a.m.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.208
Was he read his rights before you left?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.293
That's affirmative.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.962
And he called
the public defender's office.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.923
FRANK: Thank you, gentlemen.

36:18.843 --> 36:19.969
Jerry.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.599
Nice work at the accident
scene this morning.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.934
Oh, thanks, Frank.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.188
COFFEY: You sure about that?

36:31.105 --> 36:33.482
Yeah. Yeah.
They were all the labels that I had.

36:34.817 --> 36:37.069
Right. Uh-huh.

36:38.654 --> 36:39.614
None of it?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.160
(sighs) O-Okay. Thanks. Thank you.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.582
That was Division. They ran checks
on the maker labels

36:49.665 --> 36:52.043
for every garment bust
in the last six months.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.711
Can't prove they're stolen, huh?

36:54.086 --> 36:55.504
Book 'em or lose 'em, Joe.

36:56.839 --> 37:00.092
Henry, you don't think strings
could have been pulled?

37:00.176 --> 37:01.427
You know, downtown.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.932
Couple racks of suits,
maybe two seasons out of fashion.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.227
Maybe Guido gave Chief Daniels
a three-piece for Christmas.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.439
Hey, Joe. You think maybe your cousin

37:13.522 --> 37:16.859
could pull me a size 46, uh, regular in,
like, a poly-Dacron.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.527
-Oh.
-Or western cut kind of thing?

37:18.986 --> 37:21.239
-You think you could--
-How about this nice gray?

37:21.322 --> 37:23.074
That's beautiful.
Little stripes comin' down like that.

37:23.157 --> 37:26.202
Little lone star pin here in the corner do
me just fine. Thank you very much.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.537
(thunder rumbling)

37:32.917 --> 37:34.627
Now what do we do? Get the rubber hose
treatment or what?

37:34.710 --> 37:36.712
Oh, come on. Knock it off, will ya, Guido?

37:38.547 --> 37:40.883
Kid from my own block. Joey Coffey.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.636
-Turns cop and he busts me.
-Hey. Do me a favor too.

37:43.719 --> 37:47.056
Cut the<i> paisan </i>routine, all right?
'Cause I don't want to hear it anymore.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.850
How many times do I gotta listen to
"I knew your father when..."

37:49.934 --> 37:51.978
I don't care when
you knew my father, Guido.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.188
I'm out of that. It won't work.
So forget it.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.234
(thunder rumbling)

37:59.193 --> 38:00.027
(sighs)

38:01.070 --> 38:03.364
Look. I didn't mean it quite like that.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.493
All I meant was is that we all change.
That's all.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.547
Guido, I looked up to you
when I was a kid.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.633
You were somebody special to me.
You were somebody in my life.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.469
And now I look at you,
and you know what I see?

38:25.970 --> 38:29.682
I gotta tell you the truth.
I see a third-rate wise guy.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.561
I always was a third-rate wise guy,
Joseph.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.271
You just never knew it.

38:35.813 --> 38:39.275
That was the whole problem.
Nobody ever took me seriously.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.737
Even your father,
one of the finest men I ever knew.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.947
Even he didn't take me seriously.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.743
The dry cleaners.
"Guido, the pants ready Tuesday?"

38:48.826 --> 38:50.369
"Guido, the spot didn't come out."

38:50.828 --> 38:55.416
Now, finally, finally,
they take me seriously.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.086
Because of you or because,
uh, they think you're connected?

38:59.795 --> 39:02.590
I'm an old man. I got their respect.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.343
What do I care how I got it?

39:06.260 --> 39:07.928
And I'll tell you something else.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.389
All those old people outside there,

39:11.057 --> 39:12.183
nobody.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.186
Nobody messes with any of us.

39:15.978 --> 39:16.979
That's right.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.192
The snatchers, the muggers,
they don't come up on 118th Street.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.446
GUIDO:
'Cause the word's out. I'm a cheese.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.657
And you're not.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.122
Nah.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.291
I ain't connected.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.507
I buy all the clothes at distress sales.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.093
Last year's stuff. Tag is still on it.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.929
I talk it up and let people think
what they want to think.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.936
I don't hurt nobody, Joseph.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.231
Guido, why didn't you just tell me?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.775
I mean, you could have
saved us all this grief.

40:04.443 --> 40:05.945
'Cause I got pride, Joey.

40:07.738 --> 40:08.989
Don't you understand that?

40:12.868 --> 40:15.413
Maybe my life ain't everything
you thought it was.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.667
And maybe I'm not a good
example to the kids.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.712
But most of them don't know anyways,
just like you never knew.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.051
Ah, it's funny.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.138
(sighs)

40:33.722 --> 40:37.017
Right now, Joseph, my life...

40:37.935 --> 40:39.812
is more than I ever thought it would be.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.652
(thunder rumbling)

40:51.532 --> 40:53.534
Look. You didn't commit any crime.

40:57.663 --> 41:00.207
There's just some things
that I gotta straighten out

41:01.292 --> 41:03.961
for myself about the neighborhood.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.047
There's nothin' to straighten out, Joey.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.092
Like you said, you're out of it.

41:10.926 --> 41:11.927
You moved.

41:12.344 --> 41:15.639
I'm sorry, Guido. I should have never
dragged you down here like this.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.184
Hey, Joseph.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.943
Everything works out for the best.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.112
<i>Capisce?</i>

41:39.705 --> 41:41.457
And don't be a stranger, huh, kid?

41:48.422 --> 41:50.883
Yeah. Yeah, Lenny.
I know you special ordered it for me.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.968
LENNY:<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>Well, it's only 178.50 a month.</i>

41:53.052 --> 41:55.387
You tell me how I'm gonna make
the payments if the union walks out.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.348
<i>-You tell me. You're--</i>
-Come on, Lenny.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.893
They're gonna be lined up around the block
to take the camper off your hands.

42:01.101 --> 42:03.562
-Sleeves are a little short.
-I like the buttons.

42:03.646 --> 42:04.855
What do you mean?
Lime green's a great color.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.317
-I think the sleeves are a little short.
-Oh, it'll be okay, Lieutenant.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.818
-Think so?
-Oh, sure.

42:11.695 --> 42:15.950
-Hey. (speaking Italian)
-(chattering)

42:16.033 --> 42:17.785
-Take care of it, Guido?
-Hey.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.955
Who are we talkin' about here?
Guido Barbari. Come on.

42:21.497 --> 42:24.792
-Hey. Fats.
-(chattering)

42:35.553 --> 42:39.431
-(speaking Italian)
-Excuse me.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.267
Excuse.

42:42.268 --> 42:45.437
You fill out the green form, and I'll look
at it when I get back from the john, okay?

42:45.521 --> 42:46.522
Okay.

42:47.147 --> 42:51.443
Listen. We're gonna have to do something
with the racks, get 'em back to his house.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.905
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.993
That's right, Bill. We'll get the papers
down there as soon as we can.

43:41.076 --> 43:42.953
-Sure. You too.
-(thunder rumbling)

43:47.082 --> 43:48.375
Hello, counselor.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.879
You feel like talking
about an assault, Frank?

43:52.338 --> 43:54.006
You have a client accused of assault?

43:55.382 --> 43:58.385
Victim of an assault by a police officer,

44:00.512 --> 44:04.391
resulting in multiple
contusions, abrasions,

44:04.475 --> 44:07.394
three fractured ribs
and a severe concussion.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.023
Sounds like excessive force to me,
pizza man.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.401
Not to mention assault
under color of authority

44:14.485 --> 44:16.695
and a violation of the man's civil rights.

44:18.489 --> 44:22.785
In which case, your officer, Gerald Nash,
could be looking at some serious time.

44:24.536 --> 44:26.121
I talked to my men, Joyce.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.834
They weren't aware of the full extent
of the injuries,

44:30.918 --> 44:34.088
but they assured me
it was a necessary force situation.

44:42.429 --> 44:44.640
(thunderclap)

44:48.268 --> 44:52.690
I heard you were, uh, instrumental
in bringing him from Jefferson Heights.

44:54.066 --> 44:57.027
I also heard he had some
disciplinary trouble over there.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.406
Did you also hear he pulled two people

45:00.489 --> 45:02.991
out of a burning car
less than eight hours ago?

45:03.659 --> 45:06.161
I'm sure he's an exemplary human being.

45:07.162 --> 45:09.665
But my client is being charged
with resisting arrest

45:09.748 --> 45:13.335
and attempted assault on a police officer,
and he's the only one that got hurt.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.047
Internal Affairs will have
the entire matter tomorrow morning.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.591
Regardless of their conclusions, Frank,

45:20.008 --> 45:22.261
Jerry Nash stepped way out of bounds
on this one.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.806
One of my most reliable men
says otherwise, counselor.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.228
(thunderclap)

45:31.311 --> 45:33.313
All you have to do
is when you file reports,

45:33.397 --> 45:36.400
just say you saw it,
and it was reasonable and necessary.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.194
The guy's got some real problems.

45:39.278 --> 45:42.698
Sure he's got problems. He's troubled
and maybe even should see a psychiatrist,

45:42.781 --> 45:46.160
but the guy helped me
get started on this force.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.996
He saved two lives this morning,

45:49.079 --> 45:51.623
and what happened to him
could have happened to any one of us.

45:53.542 --> 45:55.085
Now, if we don't back him,

45:56.003 --> 45:58.839
his whole career is goin' down the tubes.

46:01.175 --> 46:04.803
Bobby, you're asking me to cover for a guy
that I hardly even know.

46:07.181 --> 46:10.267
(thunder rumbling)

46:10.893 --> 46:15.189
Maybe I was wrong,
but that's the story I told Furillo.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.193
So, see, uh,

46:20.277 --> 46:21.945
if we don't back Bobby, then

46:22.321 --> 46:24.990
he's gonna get hung out to dry
up there with Nash.

46:27.201 --> 46:31.497
What we're talkin' about doing now
could lead to perjury.

46:32.915 --> 46:37.294
Okay. Okay, then. Just...
Just write that you didn't see anything.

46:38.462 --> 46:43.050
You and Joe came up
after we put the cuffs on.

46:43.133 --> 46:47.596
It's a lie, Bobby. It might be easier
to defend, but it's a lie.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.521
I'm backin' him.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.077
Okay.

47:11.370 --> 47:12.621
We didn't see anything.

47:14.122 --> 47:16.416
But you gotta know this, Bobby.
This one's for you.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.044
BATES: And it's askin' a lot.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.521
(thunderclap)

47:42.818 --> 47:45.404
(typing)

48:02.087 --> 48:04.548
-Well?
-HILL: We're gonna back you.

48:06.758 --> 48:09.303
But let me tell you somethin', pal.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.556
We may cover for you,

48:12.973 --> 48:15.392
but none of us are goin' back
on the street with you.

48:18.437 --> 48:21.148
Goodwill's a short ration up here,

48:22.232 --> 48:24.610
and you just used up all of yours.

48:47.049 --> 48:50.052
(closing theme playing)
