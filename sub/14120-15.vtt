You're a good man, Rick.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.238
Your body shame,
your time management issues

06:13.240 --> 06:15.006
will remain our little secret.

right there.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.083
It's true, ma'am.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.420
We conducted
a very thorough investigation

and we think
Rick is a good dude.

a single thing wrong with him?

06:34.328 --> 06:35.527

06:35.529 --> 06:37.562
He does have
kind of a pig nose.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.797

What's going on?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.775
What are these beasts?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.411
These beasts
are my children, Rick.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.813
And your brothers.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.514
What?

07:29.516 --> 07:33.084
For many years
I have come to this island
to have sex with animals.

07:33.086 --> 07:37.689
Naturally, in some cases,
unintended pregnancy
has been the result.

07:37.691 --> 07:41.293
I've had sexual intercourse
with goats, and horses,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.628
wild boar, and deer.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.031
I have lain with the lamb,
and the lion.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.167
Although, in that instance
only the lion bore a child.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.268

07:51.472 --> 07:53.472

of my loins.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.006
As are you.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.441
It's not possible.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.544
-Your mother was
a prize-winning Yorkshire pig.
-No!

07:59.546 --> 08:04.216
I cannot begin to describe
the intense pleasure
we shared.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.418
I think that's
one of the reasons
when you were born,

08:06.420 --> 08:07.986
you were so human-like.

08:07.988 --> 08:12.224
Because I gave her
so very much of me.

08:12.226 --> 08:15.093
I couldn't bear to leave you
alone in the savage jungle

08:15.095 --> 08:16.962
so I dropped you off
at a hospital.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.965
Taking advantage of those
safe haven programs

08:19.967 --> 08:22.934
where they don't
ask any questions
if you leave a newborn.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.903
Well, you can imagine my shock
when I realized

08:24.905 --> 08:27.305
you had found your way
back to me

08:27.307 --> 08:29.307
through my sweet little Amy.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.709
What's going on here?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.811
Well, I just explained that.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.579
Well, I wasn't here yet.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.248
Fine.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.818
I'm into bestiality
and thus the father
of all these creatures.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.553
Whoa, (BLEEP), man.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.021
I didn't think you were
going to say that.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.191

08:46.193 --> 08:48.527

08:48.529 --> 08:50.028
I am your wife, Walter.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.897
It's not that easy
to talk about

08:51.899 --> 08:55.867
even if it seems like
I'm comfortable talking
about it. I'm not!

08:55.869 --> 08:59.204
Or I wouldn't have had to buy
a private island to do it on.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.805
What are you talking about?

09:00.807 --> 09:02.941
No, not until
everyone is here.
Where is Molly?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.843
She's coming.
Now, what is happening?

09:04.845 --> 09:09.147
No, not until she gets here.
I am not talking about this
80 times.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.282
(RUSTLING)

09:10.284 --> 09:11.850
BETSY: There she is.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.286
-Now tell us.
-What?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.621
I enjoy sexual...

09:16.623 --> 09:18.123
He (BLEEP) animals.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.357
(BOTH GASPING)

09:19.359 --> 09:20.692
Are you going to talk or am I?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.227
You can go.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.395
It's true.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.863
Oh, my God.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.098
It was a predilection
I had picked up in college

09:27.100 --> 09:28.967
at our fraternity house.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.703
What was hazing for some was

09:31.705 --> 09:34.039
pleasurable for others.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.642
So, these things
are your children?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.611
Why wouldn't you wear
a condom?

09:39.613 --> 09:43.181
For God sake,
you may as well not be having
sex with an animal at all

09:43.183 --> 09:44.783
if you wear a condom.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.785
I'm sorry, are we having
the wedding or not?

09:48.187 --> 09:49.788
(GROWLING)

09:53.392 --> 09:55.360
-Yes.
-We are?

09:55.362 --> 09:56.628
I love you.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.264
I don't care
that you're half pig.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.699
Mmm...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.203
(APPLAUDING)

10:08.240 --> 10:10.208
Ugh, so they don't care

10:10.210 --> 10:12.243
that they're brother
and sister?

10:13.679 --> 10:16.481
And she doesn't care
that her husband
(BLEEP) animals?

10:16.483 --> 10:20.285
All right, let's get
the (BLEEP) out of here.
Where's Pigeon?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.821
You know, I've never had sex
with a bridesmaid before?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.323
You know, I've never had sex
with a...

10:25.325 --> 10:26.625
An animal before.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.259
Really?
I think a lot of people do it.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.362
And either way
you're doing it now.
