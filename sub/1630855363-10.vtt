27:45.907 --> 27:47.143

27:47.176 --> 27:48.813
Tina? Tina, you still there?

27:48.846 --> 27:51.117
TINA:
Always, Jeffrey. Always.

27:51.150 --> 27:52.486
Who's Tony?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.089
(ticket machine whirs, clicks)

27:54.858 --> 27:56.027
CARMY: What?

27:56.060 --> 27:57.096
(whirrs, clicks)

27:57.129 --> 27:59.100
TINA:
You said Tony called you.

27:59.133 --> 28:01.304
(ticket machine
whirring and clicking)

28:01.337 --> 28:03.509
Yeah, Tony called.
Tony's the fridge guy.

28:03.542 --> 28:05.045
What the fuck
are you talking about?

28:05.078 --> 28:07.851
He's... he's-he's-he's
getting frozen. He's locked.

28:07.884 --> 28:09.320
-He can't--
-Little pimp is cooked, okay?

28:09.353 --> 28:10.388
Little pimp is cooked.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.295
TINA: Mm-mm.
Fridge guy's name is Terry.

28:13.328 --> 28:14.732
(whirring and clicking
continues)

28:14.765 --> 28:16.368
-(pounds on door)
-See, that-that's exactly

28:16.401 --> 28:17.270
what I'm talking about.

28:17.303 --> 28:18.305
Shut the fuck up.

28:18.338 --> 28:19.373
What's going on?

28:19.875 --> 28:21.410
He's... He's in the...

28:21.812 --> 28:24.852
He's in the walk-in, but
like the door handle came off.

28:24.885 --> 28:26.922
(whirring and clicking)

28:26.955 --> 28:28.392
CARMY:
Yo, maybe-maybe
I'm just not built for this.

28:28.425 --> 28:29.795
(whirring and clicking

28:29.828 --> 28:30.896
Right?

28:31.965 --> 28:33.001
Maybe that's okay.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.406
Maybe that just is.

28:35.439 --> 28:36.942
He's stuck in the walk-in?

28:36.975 --> 28:38.946
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:38.979 --> 28:40.181
-TED: Yeah.
-FAK: Yeah.

28:40.549 --> 28:43.455
Hey, could you, um, just
go and check the front
for me, please?

28:43.488 --> 28:44.792
I'm just gonna get some air.

28:44.825 --> 28:46.027
Yes, Chef. One sec.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.243
(retches, gags)

28:55.245 --> 28:56.447
What was your name again?

28:56.815 --> 28:58.886
-Kelly.
-Theodore Fak.

28:58.919 --> 29:00.489
I like that "barrette."
Seriously, it's nice.

29:00.523 --> 29:02.059
-Thank you. It's from France.
-TED: Looks good.

29:02.092 --> 29:03.328
Neil's brother.

29:03.361 --> 29:04.965
Yeah. Proud of him tonight.
Seriously.

29:04.998 --> 29:06.067
-Yeah. Yeah.
-KELLY: Congrats.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.938
-Yeah!
-This food was so awesome.

29:07.971 --> 29:09.340
I didn't cook it.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.444
I wasn't here.

29:12.146 --> 29:13.816
Right? What the fuck
was I thinking?

29:13.849 --> 29:15.052
Like I was gonna be
in a relationship?

29:15.085 --> 29:17.256
I'm a fuckin'...
I'm a fuckin' psycho.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.495
That's why. That's why
I'm good at what I do.

29:19.528 --> 29:21.064
That's how I operate.

29:21.097 --> 29:23.368
I am the best
because I didn't have

29:23.401 --> 29:26.207
any of this
fuckin' bullshit, right?

29:26.240 --> 29:29.113
I could, I could focus
and I could concentrate

29:29.146 --> 29:30.850
and I had a routine

29:30.883 --> 29:33.287
and-and I had
fuckin' cell reception and...

29:52.660 --> 29:54.931
I don't need to provide
amusement or enjoyment.

29:59.373 --> 30:01.845
I don't need to receive
any amusement or enjoyment.

30:05.452 --> 30:07.122
I'm completely fine with that.

30:11.063 --> 30:14.136
Because no amount of good is
worth how terrible this feels.

30:21.451 --> 30:23.354
It's just a complete
waste of fuckin' time.

30:25.225 --> 30:27.329
CLAIRE: I'm really sorry
you feel that way, Carm.

30:32.406 --> 30:33.408
Claire?

30:39.588 --> 30:40.890
Claire?

30:49.340 --> 30:50.442
Claire? Claire?

30:52.246 --> 30:53.381
Claire!

30:59.928 --> 31:01.297
Claire? Claire?

31:04.203 --> 31:06.307
-Claire?
-(sniffles)

31:09.981 --> 31:11.016
(softly):
What the fuck?

31:15.325 --> 31:17.195
Hey. Claire Bear.
Uh...

31:18.264 --> 31:19.567
What's wrong?

31:19.868 --> 31:21.671
(sniffles)
Um...

31:27.115 --> 31:28.619
Thank you for everything,
cousin.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.925
This was so beautiful.

31:38.506 --> 31:40.943
(Carmy pounding on door)

31:44.149 --> 31:47.223
Hey, what the fuck
did you just do?

31:47.256 --> 31:49.260
I-I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what she heard.

31:49.293 --> 31:51.430
Fuckin' asshole. What did you
just say to that fuckin' girl?

31:52.132 --> 31:53.167
Richie...

31:54.169 --> 31:56.407
Richie what?
What the fuck did you just
say to that girl, Carmen?

31:56.440 --> 31:57.544
Would you shut the fuck up

31:57.577 --> 31:59.113
and get me
the fuck outta here, please?

31:59.146 --> 32:01.217
Oh, yeah, I'll get you
the fuck out of there, Donna.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.621
What the fuck
did you just say?

32:02.654 --> 32:03.522
I...

32:04.123 --> 32:06.460
-What the fuck did you just say?
-Nothing.

32:07.029 --> 32:09.233
Richie, what the fuck
did you say?

32:10.670 --> 32:12.072
Yo!

32:13.208 --> 32:15.145
Yo, cousin,
I don't understand
why you can't just let

32:15.178 --> 32:17.082
something good happen
for once in your fuckin' life?

32:17.115 --> 32:18.553
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

32:18.586 --> 32:19.521
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:19.555 --> 32:22.259
No, I'm not fucking
kidding you right now.

32:22.292 --> 32:23.295
Someone's gotta
tell you this shit.

32:23.328 --> 32:25.098
Fuck you! Fuck you.

32:25.131 --> 32:27.102
-Yeah, fuck me.
Here we go. Okay.
-CARMY: Yeah. Fuck you.

32:27.135 --> 32:28.438
-Yeah, yeah.
-You wouldn't have
shit without me.

32:28.471 --> 32:30.042
-Yeah. Alright.
-So, yeah! Fuck you!

32:30.075 --> 32:31.077
-Tough Carmen.
-CARMY: You wouldn't be
able to pay

32:31.110 --> 32:32.446
-for your fucking life...
-RICHIE: Yeah, yeah.

32:32.479 --> 32:34.685
...or your fucking kid.
You fuckin' loser.

32:34.718 --> 32:36.589
-You wanna talk to me
about my fuckin' kid?
-You fuckin' loser.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.591
-Yeah, at least I got a kid.
-Fuck you!

32:37.624 --> 32:38.526
You don't have shit.

32:38.559 --> 32:39.226
You don't have fuckin' shit.

32:39.260 --> 32:40.697
Where were you when I fuckin'

32:40.730 --> 32:42.099
put your brother in the ground,

32:42.132 --> 32:43.502
you selfish piece of shit?

32:43.535 --> 32:45.105
You know what?
You're-you're obsessed
with my family.

32:45.138 --> 32:46.407
That's what you are.
You fuckin'...

32:46.440 --> 32:47.644
I'm fucking
obsessed with you.

32:47.677 --> 32:49.046
-You're fucking leech.
-I'm obsessed with you.

32:49.079 --> 32:50.081
-You fucking leech.
-RICHIE: Yeah.

32:50.114 --> 32:51.585
-I should've cut you out!
-I fuckin' love you!

32:51.618 --> 32:53.054
I should've fuckin'
cut you the fuck out!

32:53.087 --> 32:54.056
-I fuckin' love you!
-You fuckin' need me.

32:54.089 --> 32:54.791
I fuckin' love you!

32:54.824 --> 32:55.793
-You fuckin' need me.
-Yeah.

32:55.826 --> 32:57.162
-You need me!
-Fuck you!

32:57.195 --> 32:58.599
You fuckin' need me,
you motherfucker!

32:58.632 --> 32:59.400
-Fuck you!
-You don't have shit.

32:59.433 --> 33:00.703
-Fuck you!
-Piece of fuckin' shit.

33:00.736 --> 33:01.739
Fuck you! (spits)

33:01.772 --> 33:03.074
Fuck you.

Hey, Carm. Um...

34:05.566 --> 34:06.802
I know I'm gonna see you
in a little bit,

34:06.835 --> 34:08.706
but, uh...

34:08.739 --> 34:10.308
I'm at work and, um...

34:12.580 --> 34:15.118
I don't know, I just,
I had this, like, um...

34:15.587 --> 34:17.389
sudden urge to...

34:18.625 --> 34:20.094
(Claire sighs)

34:21.732 --> 34:23.401
...to tell you that I've, um...

34:24.270 --> 34:28.779
I've always had this, like,
massive crush on you, um...

34:30.315 --> 34:32.854
and I think you're, um...

34:32.887 --> 34:37.162
so special and, um,
so wonderful.

34:37.195 --> 34:38.197
And I, uh...

34:40.536 --> 34:41.905
I'm just so excited for you

34:41.938 --> 34:45.679
and so thrilled
for you and, um...

34:49.386 --> 34:52.727
I know it can be hard to,
like, find a second

34:52.760 --> 34:54.831
to feel good about
what you're doing

34:54.864 --> 34:57.135
right in the middle of
when you're doing it, but, uh...

34:58.539 --> 35:00.542
I just hope you know that I'm...

35:05.686 --> 35:07.322
I'm so proud of you.

35:10.295 --> 35:12.700
And Mikey would be
so proud of you, bear.

35:14.971 --> 35:16.306
Um...

35:18.912 --> 35:20.314
And I just, um...

35:25.391 --> 35:26.828
I-I really love you.
