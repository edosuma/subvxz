00:05.918 --> 00:08.443
HOLLY [on TV]: <i>That's the thing
about Christmas.</i>

00:08.573 --> 00:10.010
All you have
to do is believe.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.185
Well, I believe

00:11.315 --> 00:13.143
- that I love you.
- What are we watching?

00:13.274 --> 00:14.971
It's a made-for-TV
Christmas movie called

00:15.102 --> 00:17.278
<i>Single and Ready to Kringle,</i>
and it's amazing.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.106
Yeah, well, a lot
of plot holes, though.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.238
I mean, how does Derek afford
a chalet like that

00:21.369 --> 00:23.327
on a Christmas tree
farmer's salary?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.634
And why is Holly
quitting her job in the city?

00:25.764 --> 00:28.202
She was so driven.
Oh, Jay, Holly wasn't

00:28.332 --> 00:29.855
- happy in the city.
- Mm.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.944
And Derek was an heir
to the North Pole fortune.

00:32.075 --> 00:35.035
Yeah, Holly wants
to get up on that North Pole.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.645
Please don't make
Christmas dirty, Trevor.

00:36.775 --> 00:37.820
It's pure and beautiful.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.561
And everyone loves it.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.912
Why Christmas decorations
in Thor's room?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.435
Thor hate Christmas.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.002
Well, almost everyone.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.309
Okay, so, apparently,
Thor hates Christmas.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.268
Oh, boy, that's not gonna fly,
not in Sam's house.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.053
Jay's right. Christmas

00:53.183 --> 00:54.706
is not just
a holiday to me.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.665
It's a season,
it's a lifestyle.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.320
It's a coffee flavor
that she starts using in June.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.843
Christmas steals best part

01:00.973 --> 01:03.019
of Norse Yule Festival
and make lame.

01:03.150 --> 01:07.545
Takes wise Odin, turn him
into stupid-faced fat man.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.331
Huh. Isn't that like that
cultural appropriation thing

01:10.461 --> 01:12.115
you're always saying
is so bad, Sam?

01:12.246 --> 01:14.900
Uh, no, nope, I-I think
that this is different.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.293
How is different?

01:16.424 --> 01:19.905
Mock culture,
cause Thor great pain.

01:20.036 --> 01:20.819
Well, you see,
the thing is that

01:20.950 --> 01:22.952
if you really look at it,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
then the point
of Chris... Oh!

01:25.215 --> 01:26.477
They're about to get
on the candy cane train.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.044
This is my favorite part.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.351
Saved by the jingle bell.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.918
The...
Not-not saved by the bell,

01:33.049 --> 01:34.311
but saved by the <i>jingle</i> bell.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.791
- Oh, I understood.
- Okay.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.451
Okay, I just got
a text from Bela.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.017
She's pulling up.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.541
Can you believe it, Jay?

01:46.671 --> 01:47.803
We're hosting friggin' Christmas
at our house.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.500
This is the dream.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.067
Yeah, well, it's just my sister

01:51.198 --> 01:53.113
and probably a bag
of her laundry, but sure.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.985
Hey, Sam, I just want to say
that even though Bela is my ex,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.465
I promise
things will not get weird.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.641
Okay, "ex" feels a little strong
for someone

01:59.771 --> 02:01.599
who doesn't live on the
same plane of existence as you.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.514
The point is,
she's a great girl,

02:03.645 --> 02:04.950
she deserves to be happy,

02:05.081 --> 02:06.822
and I want her
to find somebody.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.955
Hey!
Merry Christmas!

02:10.086 --> 02:11.783
Hey.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.176
Hi.
Hi.
Hey.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.438
Hey there. Hi.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.744
Oh, I hope it's okay
I brought someone.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.441
This is Eric.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.095
- Well, hello, Eric.
- Hello.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.357
Hi. I'm Bela's
brother, Jay.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.445
Great. Great, Jay.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.968
Who's this schmuck?

02:23.099 --> 02:24.056
You just said you wanted
her to meet somebody.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.971
Yeah, but not bring him here.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.322
She knows I haunt this house.
This is just rude.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.976
Ugh. My car got booted
and I needed a ride.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.500
Turns out, if you park
at a Dunkin' Donuts

02:32.630 --> 02:35.198
for more than two weeks,
they will take action.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.591
Well, it's Christmas,
so the more, the merrier.

02:36.721 --> 02:37.983
Welcome, Eric.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.377
- Oh, thanks.
- It's great to have you. Um,

02:40.508 --> 02:41.857
should I be making up
a second room or...

02:41.987 --> 02:43.946
Yeah, are you guys...

02:44.076 --> 02:46.122
That's an unfortunate
hand gesture.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.645
Oh. [laughing]: Oh God.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.821
Oh, God, no.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.910
- Okay, she's not into him.
- Oh, no.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.477
We've just been
friends forever.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.349
Can you even
imagine, Eric?

02:55.479 --> 02:57.438
No.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.917
- Ugh. This poor guy.
- No.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.832
May I use your restroom?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.007
Probably needs
to check to see

03:02.138 --> 03:03.183
if his man parts
are still there.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.749
Of course. It's just back there

03:04.880 --> 03:07.665
behind the tree.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.668
He seems nice.
What does he do?

03:10.799 --> 03:12.104
Oh, he's an architect.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.541
He actually owns his own firm.

03:13.671 --> 03:14.933
They just did the new wing
at the hospital.

03:15.064 --> 03:18.285
A cute, successful architect,
and he's single?

03:18.415 --> 03:20.243
Yeah. And, honestly, I think

03:20.374 --> 03:22.854
he might have a little thing for
me, but I'm just not into him.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.248
- Why not?
- Too stable? Too nice?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.163
- Too normal?
- I don't know.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.600
He's just, like, always there
for me, doing anything I need.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.733
He's, like, always
driving me to the airport.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.691
He's helped me move,
like, four times.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.345
What a monster.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.782
Well, the holidays have
a funny way of helping you see

03:37.913 --> 03:40.220
what's been right in front
of your face all along.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.222
Thank you, but I don't think
I need any help

03:42.352 --> 03:44.136
when it comes to men.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.922
By the way, is Trevor around?

03:47.052 --> 03:49.098
Aw, she asked about me.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.448
Okay. Uh, Jay, if you could
point us to the rooms,

03:51.579 --> 03:52.841
I'll grab the bags.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.712
Oh, I'll help.
It's just right up the stairs.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.366
Oh, great, and then,

03:56.497 --> 03:58.586
I'm making everybody
Christmas cookies.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.025
Yeah, definitely don't
give this guy a chance.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.941
Sorry.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.770
Your little matchmaking attempt
didn't bear any fruit.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.598
Oh, no. I'm not deterred.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.730
Just wait till I sprinkle
a little bit of reindeer dust,

04:12.861 --> 04:15.080
and then it's gonna be just
like a Christmas movie.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.213
What the hell, Sam?
You don't have to fix her up

04:17.344 --> 04:19.215
- right in front of my face.
- You're right, Trevor.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.825
That was insensitive of me.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.088
It's just that he seems
like a nice guy,

04:23.219 --> 04:24.525
and you don't have a body.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.831
Ooh.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.834
Okay, well, I'm still a person.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.706
Are you? Are we?

04:31.836 --> 04:33.447
I actually don't know.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.710
That is a
complicated question.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.972
<i>How about "Jingle Bells"?</i>

04:37.102 --> 04:38.843
<i>Let's do "Silent Night."</i>

04:38.974 --> 04:40.584
<i>No, no, no, it should be
"White Christmas."</i>

04:40.715 --> 04:41.672
What are you guys doing?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.544
Oh, brainstorming song ideas.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.241
It's gonna be our present
for Sam on Christmas morning.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.590
We're calling our little group

04:46.721 --> 04:48.026
Alberta and the
Christmas Cookies.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.593
We hadn't really
landed on that yet.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.029
It's Alberta and the
Christmas Cookies.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.422
And we have a name.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.294
Isaac, did you see
the mistletoe?

04:54.424 --> 04:55.643
Are you gonna bring Nigel by

04:55.773 --> 04:57.775
for a special holiday treat?

04:57.906 --> 04:59.211
Oh, well, I would, but...

04:59.342 --> 05:01.126
I wouldn't want
to be too insensitive

05:01.257 --> 05:02.911
to others
by flaunting my happiness.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.608
What are you talking about?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.393
Well, I hesitate to bring
this up in present company,

05:06.523 --> 05:08.090
but there was
the face-palm incident

05:08.220 --> 05:09.918
between Pete and Alberta.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.354
Oh, right.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.008
When Pete tried
to kiss Alberta

05:13.138 --> 05:14.705
and then she palmed his
face like a basketball.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.533
Yeah, that was hard to watch.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.056
I was told to be proud.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.320
In any case, I'm okay.
Don't hold back for me.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.409
Well, we're not really ones
for public displays.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.498
Okay, but how's it going
in private?

05:24.628 --> 05:26.761
Well, we're not really big
on private displays.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.806
So, y'all haven't
kissed yet? At all?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.504
That is correct.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.201
Isaac, it's been months.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.072
I would've slept with him
and his bass player by now.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.726
Well, we're moving
at our own pace.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.162
Doesn't sound like
you're moving at all.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.599
- Oh.
- Whew.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.991
Man, when Pete's slamming
your sex life,

05:40.122 --> 05:41.428
that is not a place
you want to be.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.952
- Agreed.
- I don't owe any of you

05:44.082 --> 05:45.954
an explanation. Hmm?

05:46.084 --> 05:48.826
So, uh, bass player, huh?

05:48.957 --> 05:50.872
Incredibly
nimble fingers.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.917
- Ooh.
- I played the oboe.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.571
Cool.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.007
<i>What's wrong, Trevor?</i>

05:56.138 --> 05:57.487
It's just
this whole thing with Bela.

05:57.618 --> 05:58.706
Seeing her again

05:58.836 --> 06:00.708
has brought up a lot
of old feelings.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.624
I actually like her.
And she likes me.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.322
And now I have to watch Sam
set her up with this dweeb.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
What does he have
that I don't?

06:08.193 --> 06:10.195
A body. Big whoop.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.328
- Hmm.
- What?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.808
Well...

06:13.938 --> 06:14.939
No. It's crazy.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.593
No. What? Say it.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.726
Well, we know
from Hetty and Jay

06:18.856 --> 06:20.858
how a ghost can possess
a person, right?

06:20.989 --> 06:22.556
Yeah.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.079
And Bela did say that Eric

06:24.209 --> 06:26.124
would do basically
anything she asked.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.300
Oh, my God, Sass, you're saying

06:28.431 --> 06:30.955
that I possess Eric
so I can be with Bela?

06:31.086 --> 06:33.523
That's exactly what I'm saying.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.264
Sass, you're a genius.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.570
Hey, I don't know
if this will be successful.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.181
But if it is,
it'll be the greatest thing

06:39.311 --> 06:40.704
I've ever been a part of.

06:40.835 --> 06:43.794
We're sending you
where no ghost has gone before.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.362
- Inside Eric.
- Inside Eric.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.805
Hey. What's going on here?

06:54.936 --> 06:56.764
Sam is attempting
to recreate a scene

06:56.894 --> 06:58.592
from <i>Single and Ready
to Kringle,</i>

06:58.722 --> 07:00.028
in which Derek
and Holly fall in love

07:00.158 --> 07:01.769
while building
a gingerbread house together.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.248
Just get 'em drunk, Sam.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.947
Oh, uh, I should
check on some laundry,

07:06.077 --> 07:09.429
but if you two feel like having
a frosting fight or anything,

07:09.559 --> 07:10.560
don't worry about the mess.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.476
Oh. That's nice.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.698
Yes! They left the iPad open.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.482
Uh, what are you two
knuckleheads up to?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.397
Look, it's groundbreaking.
That's all you need to know.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.400
Oh, come on, man. We're cool.
We're not gonna narc.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.968
Fine. We're texting Bela

07:27.098 --> 07:29.840
to see if she'll convince Eric
to let me possess him for a day

07:29.971 --> 07:31.886
so that she and I can
finally be together.

07:32.016 --> 07:35.324
This is the greatest
thing I ever heard.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.589
One small step for a ghost,

07:39.720 --> 07:41.765
one giant leap for ghost kind.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.464
- Yes.
- Okay, Trevor, do your thing.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.905
Oh, first one's always
- a little off.
- Okay.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.210
Take your time, take
your time, take your time.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.908
You got it,
you got it, you got it.

07:54.038 --> 07:54.909
Operation

07:55.039 --> 07:56.911
Boyfriend for Bela
is underway.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.913
Samantha, I was watching
<i>Bodices and Barons</i>

07:59.043 --> 08:01.132
and he changed the channel.
Admonish him.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.571
- Sparks flying?
- Not yet. Phase one:
start off wholesome.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.530
Then we turn the heat up
with phase two: ice skating.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.838
Okay, babe, if you want
to turn up the heat,

08:10.968 --> 08:13.101
have Eric go outside
and chop some wood.

08:13.231 --> 08:16.800
- Why?
- Because Bela loves
these videos.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.672
She sends them to
the family thread.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.238
This is a lumberjack from Maine

08:20.369 --> 08:21.805
- Oh, yeah.
- With 300,000 followers.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.113
This one's really thick.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.114
Oh, my.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.291
Oh, my.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.771
Do another.
Do it now.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.642
Wait. I'm on the family thread.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.296
Why haven't I seen these?

08:34.426 --> 08:36.211
Yeah, there's another
family thread.

08:36.341 --> 08:39.170
Champa calls it
the Core Group.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.694
Hey.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.565
Sam not core group
in own family.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.394
Very funny.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.396
What's the Skittle?

08:47.527 --> 08:48.745
Our doorknob.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.355
Oh.

08:50.486 --> 08:54.577
And.... sent.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.015
Oh, my God, we have contact.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.409
Ooh. She's smiling.
That's good.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.324
All right, everybody,
just calm down.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.108
She's typing.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.936
Ooh, the, uh, the
marshmallow could be like

09:06.067 --> 09:06.894
the smoke coming out
of our chimney.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.070
- Hang on a sec.
- Yes.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.205
Holy hell.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.598
- She said yes!
- This is incredible!

09:20.821 --> 09:23.780
And we are now ready
to receive mail.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.828
Congrats,
Teddy Bear on a rainbow.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.743
You have made
the Christmas tree.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.832
This not Christmas tree.

09:31.962 --> 09:34.878
This tree of Balder,
god of sun!

09:35.009 --> 09:38.055
You desecrate
my culture, small man.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.363
Whoa.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.104
Sam's letting you make
tree-decorating decisions

09:43.234 --> 09:45.019
on your own?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.587
No, I have
very detailed instructions.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.632
Hilarious that
- she thinks he's joking.
- Hm.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.635
Hey, I don't think I ever
asked you about that time

09:52.766 --> 09:54.332
you got possessed by a ghost.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.812
Oh, uh, no, you didn't.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.466
No, Bela,
you got to ease into it.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.207
Yeah, he's gonna
see right through that.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.948
I mean, I joked
about it.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.602
Victorian lady inside of you.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.299
Objectively funny.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.607
But it must've been weird
and probably a little scary.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.871
It was a little scary,
thank you.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.481
Well, if you want someone
to talk to,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.049
I'd love to hear how you felt,
and, you know,

10:15.179 --> 10:17.442
like, maybe a little bit
about how it happened.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.401
That's very nice of you, Bela.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.056
Ooh, she knows
just what buttons to push.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.666
Well, I was standing
right over there

10:23.797 --> 10:25.886
and I was trying
to fix that sconce.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.583
Where exactly?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.933
Oh, well... right here.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.979
And then, I was up
on a ladder, obviously.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.546
A ladder. Right.
And where do you keep that?

10:34.677 --> 10:37.114
- No! Too close to the sun.
- Be cool, Bela.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.247
In the supply closet,
but why does that matter?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.771
Jay, I'm just trying
to be here for you.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.339
I feel like you went through
this really traumatic thing

10:44.469 --> 10:45.906
and you can't even talk
to your friends about it.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.559
Must be so hard.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.649
It is. It is hard.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.477
God, I'm so glad
- you're here, Bela.
- Oh.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.696
She saved it.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.307
Hey, that's what family's for.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.919
Now, this supply closet--
is that on this floor?

10:59.049 --> 11:00.921
Hey, bud.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.487
Excited about the
big day tomorrow?

11:02.618 --> 11:04.011
Yes.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.840
I'm sure my 280th Christmas

11:06.970 --> 11:08.929
will be my best one yet. Yippee.

11:09.059 --> 11:13.020
Um, look, about before...

11:13.150 --> 11:16.284
I get being nervous
about physical intimacy.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.590
I mean, heck,
I'm no Burt Reynolds myself.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.288
I don't know who that is, Pete.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.507
<i>Cannonball Run</i> star,
married to Loni Anderson.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.162
That clears everything up.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.382
Oh, it's just vexing,
these nerves.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.384
I'm no neophyte.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.908
My Beatrice and I
locked lips many times.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.301
Over a hundred.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.172
Yeah, but it's different
this time.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.131
I mean, Nigel gives you those

11:37.261 --> 11:39.133
butterflies in your stomach, right?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.135
I mean, I suppose so.
I died of dysentery,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.527
so it's always
sort of gurgling down there.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.225
But, yes, he does produce

11:44.355 --> 11:47.663
a certain flutter
that seems distinct from gas.

11:47.794 --> 11:51.101
And that is why it's gonna be
the best kiss you've ever had.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.756
You're saying that
the fact that I'm nervous

11:53.887 --> 11:55.627
is a good thing?

11:55.758 --> 11:56.933
It's a great thing.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.892
You've waited so long.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.894
You deserve this, Isaac.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.983
You just have to
get out of your own way.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.333
Thank you, Pete.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.030
And I hope you don't
give up on kissing entirely,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.119
you know,
after the face-palm incident.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.338
We don't need
to keep bringing that up.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.992
It's in the past,
like it never happened.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.428
Oh, but it did happen.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.212
And it was chilling to witness.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.562
Well, I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.043
Thank you.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.002
<i>Hey, Bela.</i>

12:22.132 --> 12:23.525
I was, uh, just thinking

12:23.655 --> 12:25.179
it might be nice
to have a fire tonight,

12:25.309 --> 12:27.572
so maybe you could
go outside with Eric

12:27.703 --> 12:29.531
and watch him
chop some firewood.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.968
Sam, are you trying
to turn this weekend

12:32.099 --> 12:33.622
into a real-life
Christmas movie?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.059
I don't know what you mean.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.800
Well, I don't want
to get your hopes up,

12:37.931 --> 12:41.717
but I think your very obvious
matchmaking might be working.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.415
I could see something
happening with me and Eric.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.244
- Seriously?
- All I'm gonna say is

12:47.375 --> 12:50.378
this will definitely be
a Christmas to remember.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.075
Oh, my God. They always
say that in the movies.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.903
They <i>always</i> say that.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.819
Hey, guys. Uh, Sam, did you
leave a flannel shirt

12:56.950 --> 12:58.038
and suspenders
on my bed?

12:58.168 --> 13:00.823
Oh, uh, laundry mishap.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.172
They're Jay's.
Anyway,

13:02.303 --> 13:04.218
I'm gonna go downstairs,
but text me

13:04.348 --> 13:06.307
if you guys need anything
from the market.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.875
I am going
- to start a grocery list.
- Oh.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.878
Mead. Sam!
You never have mead.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.705
You and small man drink,
I watch.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.533
Very fun.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.318
Hey, Eric, sit down.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.233
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.669
Is everything okay?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.149
You remember how I told you

13:22.279 --> 13:24.368
that I think
this house might be haunted?

13:24.499 --> 13:25.587
Yeah.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.023
Looks like
she's getting started.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.372
Come on, Bela.
Bring us home, baby.

13:28.503 --> 13:31.375
Well, the thing is...
it is haunted.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.508
How-how do you know
that it's haunted?

13:33.638 --> 13:35.902
Okay, this is gonna sound
weird, so just go with me.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.947
- Okay.
- You know that finance bro
I was talking to for a while?

13:38.078 --> 13:39.819
Uh, uh, Trevor, right?

13:39.949 --> 13:41.603
Yeah. Well, the thing is,

13:41.733 --> 13:43.779
Trevor's a ghost.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.694
Like, he ghosted you?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.957
No, like, he's dead,

13:48.088 --> 13:51.482
and he's an actual ghost,
and he haunts this house.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.789
I'm sorry. You must
think I'm crazy.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.618
You know,
so, after my Pop Pop died,

13:56.748 --> 13:58.576
my Nana said that
she could still talk to him

13:58.707 --> 14:00.491
and nobody believed her.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.363
But I did.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.800
So, no, I...
I don't think you're crazy.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.236
Just wait, bro.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.803
We're going way past Nana.

14:07.934 --> 14:11.633
It's just, I really like Trevor,
and he likes me.

14:11.763 --> 14:15.419
But I've never been able to
actually see him and touch him.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.118
This is it. Bottom of the ninth,
bases loaded.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.510
I'm so invested.
I'm so nervous.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.164
Eric...

14:21.295 --> 14:22.992
would you let Trevor
possess your body

14:23.123 --> 14:24.907
so that we can be together?
Just for a day.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.648
Wow, boy.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.171
Uh, this is a lot.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.520
Um... Yeah, I know, take your time.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.783
Uh, okay, so,
j-just so I have all the facts,

14:31.914 --> 14:33.524
how would this even work?

14:33.655 --> 14:36.179
Like, would I do a séance
or something?

14:36.310 --> 14:37.877
No, you just
electrocute yourself

14:38.007 --> 14:39.617
by touching exposed wiring

14:39.748 --> 14:41.054
and then your body gets
thrown back into the ghost.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.360
Yeah, I don't love that part.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.059
It's-it's fine, Eric.
You don't have to do it.

14:47.103 --> 14:51.064
Look, cards on the table--
I really like you.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.804
And someday,
I hope, maybe

14:52.935 --> 14:54.502
we'll even end up together.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.852
But this whole Trevor thing--
I can see

14:56.983 --> 14:59.115
this is something you need
to get out of your system.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.161
You need
to sow your wild ghosts.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.425
So-- I cannot believe

15:04.555 --> 15:06.035
that I'm saying this-- but...

15:06.166 --> 15:09.865
Bela, if this is what
you want for Christmas,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.998
I'm in.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.738
Yes!

15:13.869 --> 15:15.958
Thank you, Eric.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

15:16.089 --> 15:17.264
My pleasure.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.309
This guy is mentally ill
but I love him!

15:25.707 --> 15:27.622
<i>Thank you for walking me
back to the mansion, Nigel.</i>

15:27.752 --> 15:28.840
It was a lovely evening.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.886
Oh, my.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.454
We find ourselves
beneath the mistletoe.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.935
Indeed, we do.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.024
That most suggestive
of greenery.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.853
Well, we don't have to
follow tradition, Isaac.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.116
We can just say good night.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.596
No! Nonsense.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.642
We've waited this long.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.644
We should do this.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.908
Well, i-if that's what you want.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.526
Why is your hand
upon my face?

16:02.657 --> 16:05.094
I'm not sure.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.053
Could you remove it?

16:12.362 --> 16:13.755
Terribly sorry.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.410
Just a... an unfortunate reflex.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.630
But a telling one.

16:19.761 --> 16:23.286
I've been patient, Isaac,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.985
but it's clear to me you're
just not ready for this.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.858
I'm sorry to say,
I think our relationship,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.426
such that it is, should end.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.994
End?

16:35.124 --> 16:37.344
Wait. Don't leave like that.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.999
I have things to attend to
in the shed.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.957
Well, I could give you a hand.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.003
I've had quite enough
of your hand for one night.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.266
Happy Christmas.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.185
Come in.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.970
Hey, merry Christmas Eve.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.363
I just wanted to say good night.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.929
Aw, good night, Bela.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.670
Merry Christmas Eve to you, too.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.281
We're so happy you're here.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.631
Me too.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.633
So, you guys just
gonna go to sleep?

17:05.763 --> 17:08.462
- Yeah.
- Cool, cool. Me too.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.333
Like, right now?

17:10.464 --> 17:11.465
Uh-huh.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.467
Okay, good night.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.081
I am so excited
about her and Eric.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.343
I don't want to get my hopes up,

17:20.474 --> 17:22.171
but she does seem different
this trip.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.781
Like, more together
or something.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.392
I know, right?

17:25.522 --> 17:28.047
I really think she's starting
to make good decisions.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.179
Okay, so Trevor,
you stand right here,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.312
and when Eric gets electrocuted,
he'll fly back into you.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.965
Stay close
to the host body.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.229
I believe that was key
to my successful possession.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.927
- You good? Feeling loose?
- Oh, I got this.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.276
I got this.
We're rooting for you, Trevor.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.061
It's very exciting.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.585
Even I have never had
this kind of threesome.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.935
And if you should come
across any morphine, do it.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.545
Let Eric handle
the withdrawals.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.069
Now, when Trevor goes to sleep,

17:50.199 --> 17:51.809
he is gonna put in
my retainer, right?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.072
What's happening here?

17:53.202 --> 17:55.161
You said you were
going to sleep.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.294
I was putting out milk
and cookies for Santa.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.253
Why is Eric
up the ladder?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.428
Uh...

18:01.558 --> 18:03.299
Oh, my God.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.301
You're trying to get Eric
possessed by Trevor, aren't you?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.782
Hey, babe, look, I know

18:07.912 --> 18:09.349
the snickerdoodles
are for Santa, but

18:09.479 --> 18:11.829
could I just have one?
What's going on here?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.441
- Nothing.
- Bela's trying to get
Eric possessed by Trevor.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.964
Don't be a rat, Sam.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.226
Is that why you asked me

18:17.357 --> 18:18.358
about getting possessed
by Hetty?

18:18.488 --> 18:21.448
You didn't care
about my feelings.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.798
- Both things can be true, Jay.
- Wait. You got possessed?

18:23.928 --> 18:24.929
How could you, Bela?

18:25.060 --> 18:26.801
Did the electrocution part hurt?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.020
Because that's the part that I'm
sort of very concerned about.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.892
We're not going through
with this, Eric.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
That's not your call, Jay.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.157
Trevor, Eric and I are
- three consenting adults.
- What?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.507
This is epically bad,
even for you, Bela.

18:37.638 --> 18:38.682
What's that supposed to mean?

18:38.813 --> 18:39.988
Well, it's just one weird,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.382
bad relationship after the next.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.818
Oh, I'm sorry, Jay.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.254
Not all of us can
have perfect marriages

18:45.385 --> 18:46.516
and a house
that smells like cinnamon.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.083
She puts little sticks
in the heating ducts.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.215
At first I deemed it overkill

18:49.345 --> 18:50.912
but now I find it
quite pleasant.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.436
I'm not asking you
to have a perfect marriage.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.873
I'm asking you not
to sleep with a ghost

18:56.004 --> 18:58.746
on Christmas in my house!

18:58.876 --> 19:00.878
You know what?
I don't need this.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.706
Trevor, I'm sorry
it didn't work out,

19:02.837 --> 19:05.187
and I'm sorry you have
to haunt a house with such

19:05.318 --> 19:07.233
a judgmental jerk.
I'm going to bed.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.975
So, Christmas morning,

19:11.106 --> 19:13.456
are you guys like an "everyone
takes turns opening presents"

19:13.587 --> 19:15.458
kind of family, or is it more
of a free-for-all situation?

19:15.589 --> 19:18.287
- Go to bed, Eric.
- Absolutely. Merry Christmas.

19:18.418 --> 19:21.769
This is so unfair.
I was so close.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.206
Don't you start, Trevor.
You ruined Christmas.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.426
And you ruined
the seventh night of Hannukah.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.777
We all told him
- it was a bad idea.
- Yeah.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.040
- We really did.
- Mm-hmm. He wouldn't
listen to us.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.353
Morning, Thor.
Merry Christmas.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.833
Yeah.

19:42.964 --> 19:46.707
So, hideous decorations
come down tomorrow?

19:46.837 --> 19:49.057
Most people like to leave it
till after New Year's,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.494
but I go all the way up
to Groundhog Day.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.496
Yeah.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.629
What happen to light?

19:55.759 --> 19:58.240
Oh, it's kind of a long story.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.460
I'd rather not think
about it on Christmas.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.462
I should screw that
back on, though.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.296
Careful.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.472
Aah!

20:16.432 --> 20:18.565
What happen?

20:18.695 --> 20:21.481
Why hands so small and clean?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.963
Merry Christmas, Sam!

20:26.094 --> 20:30.185
We can't give you much,
but we can give you this.

20:30.316 --> 20:35.364
♪ Silent night, holy... ♪

20:35.495 --> 20:37.061
No! Hate this song!

20:38.628 --> 20:41.936
I told y'all we should've went
with "White Christmas".
