WEBVTT

01:11.761 --> 01:14.764
I work for Zelda St. John.

01:14.764 --> 01:16.455
The movie star?

01:16.455 --> 01:18.112
Isn't she a recluse?

01:18.112 --> 01:19.700
She's a nightmare.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.979
Uh, but her husband, Scott,
he's worse.

01:25.292 --> 01:27.949
He's half her age.

01:27.949 --> 01:30.469
He loves drama.
He's like a bullet in Chinatown.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.129
A bull in a china shop.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.338
Oh, I like your one better.

01:37.338 --> 01:40.514
I've been their housekeeper
for two years.

01:40.514 --> 01:42.412
Zelda's daughter, Estella,

01:42.412 --> 01:45.484
she's an actress
who never works.

01:45.484 --> 01:48.901
She married the gardener, Jed,
her third husband.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.145
Now Jed doesn't work either.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.285
- Okay, okay.
- They hate me.

01:53.285 --> 01:55.287
They think I'm stealing
from Zelda.

01:55.287 --> 01:58.325
So you want me
to clear your name?

01:58.325 --> 01:59.498
Mnh-mnh.

01:59.498 --> 02:01.328
Zelda trusts me.

02:01.328 --> 02:05.297
I, uh, respect her secrets.

02:05.297 --> 02:07.403
I don't, um...

02:09.681 --> 02:11.200
...gossip.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.512
I don't speak to newspapers,
or magazines.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.169
Just private detectives.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.417
Zelda has changed her will.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.453
She's giving some to charity.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.214
Dogs and cats.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.663
How do you know this?

02:28.424 --> 02:31.565
She's leaving the rest to me.

02:31.565 --> 02:33.187
Why you?

02:35.741 --> 02:37.950
Zelda came to this country
with nothing.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.918
I remind her of her.

02:39.918 --> 02:42.196
Do her family know?

02:42.196 --> 02:45.234
They're mad.
That's why I'm here.

02:45.234 --> 02:47.891
I went to the police, but they
didn't take me seriously.

02:47.891 --> 02:49.307
They just said
I should be happy.

02:49.307 --> 02:53.069
Well, yeah, Natalia,
you're gonna be rich.

02:53.069 --> 02:56.762
I didn't
ask for any of this.

02:56.762 --> 02:59.351
I had a plan.
I wanted to leave this job

02:59.351 --> 03:01.595
as soon as I'm finished
with college.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.459
What are you studying?

03:03.459 --> 03:05.978
Criminology.

03:05.978 --> 03:08.222
I want to join the police.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.568
Good choice.

03:09.568 --> 03:11.087
Pearl...

03:11.087 --> 03:13.123
I'm scared.

03:14.642 --> 03:18.267
I feel like I'm in danger.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.234
And maybe Zelda is, too.

03:24.721 --> 03:27.828
If something happens
to either of us...

03:27.828 --> 03:30.900
promise me you won't let them
get away with it.

Thank you.

04:11.872 --> 04:13.736
Isla.

04:13.736 --> 04:16.290
Yeah, right, um...

04:19.707 --> 04:22.123
My husband could start a fight
in an empty room.

04:24.194 --> 04:27.715
He had a sick sense of humour.
He was wild.

04:29.545 --> 04:32.513
He said to tell the truth
at the funeral.

04:32.513 --> 04:35.516
I didn't-- didn't even
make a speech.

04:38.174 --> 04:43.455
Now everyone talks about him
like he was a saint.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.356
That wasn't him.

04:51.152 --> 04:52.775
Now I...

04:59.678 --> 05:02.716
Take your time.

05:02.716 --> 05:04.338
I'm sorry.

05:06.478 --> 05:08.342
Sorry, I...

06:02.189 --> 06:05.779
Hey.

06:08.885 --> 06:09.990
Are you all right?

06:09.990 --> 06:11.440
Great.
Where have you been?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.407
I just, uh, had some stuff
to sort out.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.409
Did you check your phone?

06:15.409 --> 06:16.686
No.

06:16.686 --> 06:18.550
I texted you a house.
Uh, uh, a cottage.

06:18.550 --> 06:19.758
Right by the sea.

06:19.758 --> 06:21.070
Oh.

06:21.070 --> 06:22.761
I put an offer in.

06:22.761 --> 06:23.969
That's a bit quick, innit?

06:23.969 --> 06:25.454
It's gonna go quick.

06:25.454 --> 06:27.421
We can always withdraw it
if you don't like it.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.009
But I know you will.

06:31.287 --> 06:33.841
Kat...

06:33.841 --> 06:35.602
it's okay.

06:35.602 --> 06:38.432
Come on.
We're gonna be late.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.847
Late for what?

06:39.847 --> 06:42.091
Pearl invited us for dinner.

06:42.091 --> 06:44.300
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.992
Another night talking shop.

06:46.992 --> 06:49.512
Maybe we should hang out
with some of your other mates.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.447
Okay. Slow down.
So one of your pupils...

06:53.447 --> 06:54.862
My star pupil.

06:54.862 --> 06:56.657
She had a bottle of vodka
in her pencil case?

06:56.657 --> 06:58.072
- Yep.
- Wow.

06:58.072 --> 06:59.729
Is that to help her
get through your lessons?

06:59.729 --> 07:01.248
Ha. Ha.
She says it wasn't hers.

07:01.248 --> 07:02.594
Oh yeah, right.

07:02.594 --> 07:04.320
She's captain
of the football team.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.218
I think somebody set her up.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.841
Oh. And you're gonna
investigate?

07:07.841 --> 07:09.601
Yeah.
Don't tell DCI Mike.

07:09.601 --> 07:11.016
He might think
I'm treading on his toes.

07:11.016 --> 07:13.053
Oh, well, he'd send her down
for 10 years.

07:13.053 --> 07:14.744
So come on.
I need lots of top tips.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.608
From one amateur sleuth
to another.

07:16.608 --> 07:19.680
What do you mean amateur?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.682
Hey! There they are.

07:21.682 --> 07:22.821
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:22.821 --> 07:25.065
Let's go and sit
by the window.

07:25.065 --> 07:28.309
Mike, I wanted
to pick your brains.

07:28.309 --> 07:29.828
Do you know Zelda St. John?

07:29.828 --> 07:31.381
Um...

07:31.381 --> 07:33.487
She was an actress.
She was big in the '70s.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.731
She won three
Scream Queen awards.

07:35.731 --> 07:39.079
Anyway, her housekeeper
came to see me.

07:39.079 --> 07:40.977
There's drama around the will.

07:40.977 --> 07:42.565
What, she's not leaving it
to her family?

07:42.565 --> 07:45.085
No, she's leaving it to
cats and dogs and Natalia,

07:45.085 --> 07:47.156
the aforementioned housekeeper.

07:47.156 --> 07:48.847
Lucky her.

07:48.847 --> 07:50.504
Mm, but now she feels at risk.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.955
She says that she might be
in danger.

07:52.955 --> 07:55.854
She went to the police,
but they ignored her.

07:55.854 --> 07:58.408
- Has she got any evidence?
- No, just a feeling.

07:58.408 --> 08:00.583
But the family are definitely
looking at her different.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.998
Sounds like a paranoid nutter.

08:01.998 --> 08:03.724
No, she didn't seem
like a nutter.

08:03.724 --> 08:05.105
I liked her.

08:05.105 --> 08:07.556
She said that she wanted
to join the police.

08:07.556 --> 08:11.283
Great, more amateurs
playing detective.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.802
What's that supposed to mean?

08:12.802 --> 08:15.218
Not you, I, oh...

08:15.218 --> 08:17.289
Really? That's what
it sounded like.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.705
They arguing already?

08:18.705 --> 08:20.741
I think it's just their way
of saying hi.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.432
What,
so we just ignore her?

08:22.432 --> 08:23.744
Well, it doesn't sound
like you've got anything

08:23.744 --> 08:25.194
concrete to go on.

08:25.194 --> 08:27.576
Well, if I do nothing,
what if she gets hurt?

08:27.576 --> 08:29.819
Trust me, with experience,
you get to know

08:29.819 --> 08:32.132
when someone's
wasting your time.

08:53.602 --> 08:55.638
<i>Emergency.
Which service do you require?</i>

08:55.638 --> 08:57.433
Ambulance please!

08:57.433 --> 08:58.814
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

08:58.814 --> 09:00.470
No. It's my wife.

09:33.227 --> 09:36.161
Oh, you look upset.
Don't tell me you were a fan.

09:36.161 --> 09:38.681
She's the actress
that Pearl warned me about.

09:38.681 --> 09:41.373
Ah, queen of '70s horror.

09:41.373 --> 09:44.342
Survived attacks from vampires,
werewolves, cannibals.

09:44.342 --> 09:45.654
Yeah, and now this.

09:45.654 --> 09:47.448
- Yeah.
- What you got?

09:47.448 --> 09:49.968
Someone hit her over the head.
A blunt instrument.

09:49.968 --> 09:53.109
Have we got a weapon?
Any suspects?

09:53.109 --> 09:55.974
Yeah, Colonel Mustard
with the candlestick.

09:58.977 --> 10:01.635
Scott found her this morning.
Called the ambulance.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.533
Estella and Jed were in bed.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.157
- The housekeeper--
- Natalia?

10:06.157 --> 10:08.366
Yeah.

10:08.366 --> 10:11.196
She's done a runner.

10:11.196 --> 10:14.303
Zelda's still unconscious, but
the medics think she'll be okay.

10:14.303 --> 10:17.133
And when she wakes up,
you can get her autograph.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.894
Yeah, and she can
tell us who did it.

10:18.894 --> 10:22.069
Maybe get one for Pearl, too.

10:22.069 --> 10:24.727
She's gonna kill me.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.695
Yeah, she is.

10:35.807 --> 10:39.224
Did Zelda tell you
that she changed the will?

10:39.224 --> 10:42.262
Mother loves to play games.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.712
Poor Natalia.

10:43.712 --> 10:45.714
She was cleaning toilets
and scrubbing floors

10:45.714 --> 10:48.682
while sitting on a lottery
ticket she couldn't cash.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.858
It must have been maddening.

10:51.858 --> 10:54.481
You think Natalia
attacked your Mum?

10:54.481 --> 10:57.415
Mother changed Natalia's life,
and she had the power

10:57.415 --> 10:59.106
to change it back again.

10:59.106 --> 11:01.937
It was too much for Natalia
to bear, so she lashed out.

11:01.937 --> 11:03.559
Case closed.

11:14.259 --> 11:17.573
Did you know Zelda was
leaving everything to Natalia?

11:17.573 --> 11:19.851
I don't care
about the will.

11:19.851 --> 11:22.958
Zelda St. John is a goddess.

11:22.958 --> 11:25.754
She's the love of my life.
And I worship her.

11:26.755 --> 11:27.963
Well, can you think
of anyone else

11:27.963 --> 11:30.966
who'd want to do this?

11:30.966 --> 11:36.730
Zelda gave Natalia a beautiful,
transcendent gift.

11:38.318 --> 11:40.009
And this is how she repays her.

11:43.599 --> 11:45.221
Right.

11:49.156 --> 11:50.917
This is why
I came to you.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.297
Well, is she gonna be okay?

11:52.297 --> 11:54.230
Somebody tried to kill her!

11:54.230 --> 11:55.956
I'm sorry. I did try and talk
to the police.

11:55.956 --> 11:57.647
I told you.
Scott, Estella, Jed.

11:57.647 --> 11:59.615
They're all gold-diggers.
You can't trust any of them.

11:59.615 --> 12:01.030
And you think one of them
definitely did this?

12:01.030 --> 12:03.584
Obviously!

12:03.584 --> 12:05.517
Where am I going to go?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.105
Maybe I go to Wojciech or...

12:07.105 --> 12:10.108
Natalia, is there something
you're not telling me?

12:10.108 --> 12:11.834
Because you're the one
that stands to benefit

12:11.834 --> 12:13.111
from Zelda's death.

12:13.111 --> 12:16.183
I told you.
I didn't ask for this.

12:16.183 --> 12:18.116
Well, if you run,
you'll look guilty.

12:18.116 --> 12:20.498
They are going to say it was me.

12:20.498 --> 12:23.190
Oh, the foreign cleaner.

12:23.190 --> 12:26.780
Listen, Estella, Scott, Jed.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.817
One of them did this.

12:28.817 --> 12:31.233
Please find out who
before they find me

12:31.233 --> 12:33.856
and they throw away the key.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.790
Please...

12:51.046 --> 12:53.462
Hey.

12:53.462 --> 12:56.223
What's this?
I told you so? What?

12:56.223 --> 12:57.811
Natalia came to see me.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.088
Alright.

12:59.088 --> 13:00.607
Look, she knows
what it looks like.

13:00.607 --> 13:02.367
She says she's innocent.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.645
Yeah. She's done a runner.
And she's got a motive.

13:04.645 --> 13:06.199
It just doesn't make sense.

13:06.199 --> 13:07.407
I mean, Zelda left her everything.

13:07.407 --> 13:08.822
Why-- why not wait?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.651
Well, it's a lot of money.

13:10.651 --> 13:13.482
Maybe just too tempting.
She got greedy.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.865
You think she played me?

13:16.865 --> 13:19.419
I think she told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

13:30.050 --> 13:35.711
She told me she wanted to join
the police, and I believed her.

13:38.265 --> 13:39.853
It just doesn't feel right.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.407
I don't know, I like her.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.133
Well, you see the best
in people.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.620
It's a good quality.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.866
But in this job you need to see
the worst in people, too.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.661
And you don't.

13:59.114 --> 14:01.633
I need to speak to her, Pearl.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.257
You got any idea
where she's hiding?

14:04.257 --> 14:05.706
No.

14:06.673 --> 14:08.295
No!

14:30.524 --> 14:32.630
Yeah.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.184
Yeah, yeah I know.

14:35.184 --> 14:36.496
Alright, got to go.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.946
Boss is back.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.778
Okay.

14:42.778 --> 14:45.919
Yeah, I know.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.472
Alright, Dad.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.617
The papers are calling
her Mrs. Danvers.

14:54.617 --> 14:57.689
I know.
I'm not sure about her.

14:59.070 --> 15:02.453
Zelda St. John.

15:03.109 --> 15:06.767
She used to throw huge parties
in the old days.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.838
All the journalists
would hide in the bushes

15:08.838 --> 15:11.358
to steal photos
of the celebs.

15:11.358 --> 15:12.946
And you know this because?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.707
Because we used to cater
her parties.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.814
The A-listers demanded
a certain glamour.

15:18.814 --> 15:21.299
I bet you were in those bushes.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.509
Do you remember Charlie
and his mates

15:24.509 --> 15:26.028
used to swear
her mansion was haunted?

15:26.028 --> 15:27.650
They used to sneak up
on to the grounds,

15:27.650 --> 15:29.445
and one time, they saw Zelda
in the window,

15:29.445 --> 15:32.621
and they thought
she was a ghost.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.485
Has Charlie spoken to you yet?

15:34.485 --> 15:36.728
No, why?

15:36.728 --> 15:39.559
He wants to check
if his passport's up to date.

15:39.559 --> 15:42.734
Oh, is he going on holiday?

15:42.734 --> 15:45.979
He's thinking of going to stay
with his dad.

15:45.979 --> 15:49.155
Oh. What, for a week or two?

15:49.155 --> 15:50.777
Maybe longer.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.401
Mm.

15:54.401 --> 15:57.611
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

15:57.611 --> 15:59.648
Okay, okay,
I've got to go.

15:59.648 --> 16:02.651
Seriously, before I get
the sack. Okay, bye, bye.

16:02.651 --> 16:03.997
- Charlie.
- I know what you're gonna say.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.585
We've got 10 minutes
before we open.

16:05.585 --> 16:08.036
Glasses need cleaning.
Barrels need changing.

16:08.036 --> 16:09.658
- I'm on it.
- No, I wanted to--

16:09.658 --> 16:11.349
No, no, no, no, no, I mean it,
I promise you, I'm on it.

16:11.349 --> 16:13.179
It'll be done.

16:39.826 --> 16:42.484
Hi.

16:42.484 --> 16:45.383
I'm Pearl Nolan.
I'm the detective.

16:45.383 --> 16:46.798
What, police?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.386
No, not police, no.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.043
A private detective.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.803
I'm looking for Natalia.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.426
Join the club.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.707
Let's hope you find her first.

16:58.707 --> 17:00.295
What's that supposed to mean?

17:03.815 --> 17:07.233
I'm protective of my family,
Detective Nolan.

17:09.925 --> 17:13.377
Right, I was hoping
to speak to Estella.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.069
She's in Scott's office.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.071
Well, where's that?

17:18.071 --> 17:19.624
In the basement.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.629
I'll find it myself then,
shall I?

17:45.857 --> 17:48.515
Press are all outside.
Hiding in the bushes.

17:48.515 --> 17:49.896
It's like the old days.

17:49.896 --> 17:51.518
First time in 20 years.

17:51.518 --> 17:53.106
Mummy will be thrilled.

17:55.591 --> 17:58.249
"Zelda and me,
our story."

17:58.249 --> 18:00.458
Scott's writing Zelda's
biography.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.322
I'm proofreading it for him.

18:02.322 --> 18:04.980
You making a few edits?

18:04.980 --> 18:06.568
Bravo, Miss Marple.

18:06.568 --> 18:08.777
He's been predictably
scathing about me.

18:08.777 --> 18:11.262
So I'm finessing a few details.

18:15.370 --> 18:17.924
Mummy was beautiful.

18:17.924 --> 18:20.720
People say I look just like her.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.756
She hates me for it.

18:22.756 --> 18:25.690
Enough to write you
out of the will?

18:25.690 --> 18:28.141
You're a private detective
you say.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.143
Natalia hired you?

18:30.143 --> 18:31.938
Yeah, she did.

18:31.938 --> 18:33.664
She thought you were
gonna kill her.

18:33.664 --> 18:35.562
Really?

18:35.562 --> 18:37.599
Well, she would say that,
wouldn't she?

18:39.325 --> 18:44.157
I'll pay you double what she
offered you if you find her.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.194
Double?

18:46.194 --> 18:47.436
Have you really got no idea

18:47.436 --> 18:50.439
where you think
Natalia might be?

18:50.439 --> 18:53.856
I'll tell you what I told
that brooding policeman.

18:53.856 --> 18:56.411
Natalia's boyfriend
does seasonal work.

18:56.411 --> 18:58.171
Farm labour.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.140
Very admirable.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.176
Probably a good place
to start.

19:13.324 --> 19:15.395
- We've talked about this.
- I know.

19:15.395 --> 19:18.018
It's unprofessional.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.399
What's that supposed to mean?

19:19.399 --> 19:21.229
Oh, you know what I mean.

19:21.229 --> 19:22.747
What are you doing here anyway?

19:22.747 --> 19:25.060
- Zelda's awake.
- Oh that's good.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.373
What does she remember?

19:27.373 --> 19:29.858
It was Natalia who attacked her.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.584
Oh.

19:31.584 --> 19:34.000
Now listen, I'm telling you this
because she's dangerous,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.484
all right?

19:35.484 --> 19:37.693
You got to stay away from her.

19:39.350 --> 19:40.972
Thanks.

19:56.678 --> 20:00.060
More flowers?

20:00.060 --> 20:03.236
Are these all from your fans?

20:03.236 --> 20:05.376
I think they're all
from my husband.

20:07.965 --> 20:09.587
He adores me.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.903
Uh, I'm Pearl.

20:14.903 --> 20:17.595
I'm a private detective.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.080
Estella hired me
to find Natalia.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.325
Oh.

20:23.325 --> 20:26.846
The gumshoe
and the femme fatale.

20:26.846 --> 20:29.538
How exciting.

20:29.538 --> 20:32.403
Who's the femme fatale?
You or Natalia?

20:32.403 --> 20:35.061
I'm appalled you
even have to ask.

20:36.683 --> 20:39.514
Natalia.

20:39.514 --> 20:42.896
My mother fled Poland
just after the war.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.970
It was a very hard journey.

20:47.970 --> 20:53.182
And she had a younger sister
whose name was Natalia.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.737
But she didn't make it.

20:55.737 --> 20:57.497
I'm sorry.

20:58.774 --> 21:01.432
Maybe that's why I was
so fond of her.

21:03.331 --> 21:05.436
Were you really gonna
give her everything?

21:07.576 --> 21:11.442
I know what it's like
to come from nothing.

21:11.442 --> 21:13.306
Natalia worked hard.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.343
Her boyfriend, Wojciech,

21:15.343 --> 21:17.793
he was slogging his guts out
for minimum wage.

21:17.793 --> 21:20.382
I thought they deserved
it more.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.457
Look where that got me.

21:28.010 --> 21:31.704
Natalia came to see me
before the attack.

21:31.704 --> 21:34.327
She thought that the will
put her at risk.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.087
She was worried about you,
as well.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.093
What did Natalia tell you?

21:42.093 --> 21:43.819
She told me about your family.

21:43.819 --> 21:47.513
About Estella and Scott and Jed.

21:47.513 --> 21:49.135
Huh.

21:50.757 --> 21:54.899
I like to have a cigarette
in the morning first thing.

21:54.899 --> 21:57.557
Just when the sun is rising.

21:57.557 --> 22:01.837
And I saw Natalia
out of the corner of my eye

22:01.837 --> 22:06.739
racing towards me
with a face like fury.

22:06.739 --> 22:10.052
From the moment I told her
about the will,

22:10.052 --> 22:12.503
she looked at me
completely differently.

22:12.503 --> 22:16.611
It was as if everything
that I had was hers.

22:20.649 --> 22:22.168
Look, if it's any consolation,

22:22.168 --> 22:24.722
I think that Natalia
might have played me, too.

22:40.531 --> 22:43.741
Hello. I'm looking
for a Wojciech Pazdan.

22:43.741 --> 22:46.641
I heard that he worked there.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.021
No, I just--

22:48.021 --> 22:51.128
Rude.

22:51.128 --> 22:54.234
Wojciech Pazdan, yeah.

22:54.234 --> 22:57.030
I'm looking for him.
I need to speak to him.

22:57.030 --> 22:59.239
No, I'm not the police.

23:00.793 --> 23:04.693
Hello, I'm looking
for a Wojciech Pazdan please.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.868
He is there?

23:06.868 --> 23:08.421
Oh that-- that's great.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.974
Um, good news.

23:09.974 --> 23:12.287
He's-- he's won a competition.

23:12.287 --> 23:15.221
Yeah.
He's won a speedboat.

23:15.221 --> 23:16.878
Sure, I can hold.

23:39.970 --> 23:41.592
Hello?

23:49.911 --> 23:51.533
Hello?

24:43.102 --> 24:44.724
Hey, Mike, it's me.

24:58.773 --> 25:00.568
You're a good detective.

25:02.017 --> 25:04.088
I did my research
when I hired you.

25:07.264 --> 25:08.886
Everyone thinks it's me.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.684
Including you.

25:13.684 --> 25:15.893
Zelda told the police
you attacked her.

25:18.344 --> 25:20.104
She's lying.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.555
She was hit on the head
with something heavy.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.385
It knocked her out cold.

25:25.385 --> 25:27.698
Her award.
I just found it in your bag.

25:27.698 --> 25:29.562
I know what it looks like.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.702
But listen to me. Please.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.704
The morning Zelda was attacked,

25:33.704 --> 25:37.328
I woke up and I found
the award in my bag.

25:37.328 --> 25:40.987
There was blood on it.
I have no idea how it got there.

25:40.987 --> 25:42.402
I had to bring it with me.

25:42.402 --> 25:45.129
I couldn't let the police
find it in my room.

25:45.129 --> 25:48.581
But I promise you,
someone put it there.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.134
They framed me.

25:52.378 --> 25:55.001
I know it makes me look guilty.
I could have just chucked it.

25:55.001 --> 25:57.590
But I didn't, because
I care about Zelda.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.593
Because I know how much
it means to her.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.054
I'm sorry, Natalia.

26:13.054 --> 26:15.366
What could I do?

26:15.366 --> 26:18.646
They're all she's got.
She's covering for them.

26:18.646 --> 26:20.371
- Or she's scared of them.
- Natalia Dudek!

26:20.371 --> 26:22.408
I'm arresting you for the
attempted murder

26:22.408 --> 26:23.996
- of Zelda St. John.
- Zelda is still in danger!

26:23.996 --> 26:26.067
- Pearl! Listen to me!
- Enough.

26:26.067 --> 26:28.276
Why would I do this?

26:28.276 --> 26:29.795
Pearl!

26:31.141 --> 26:35.386
Pearl!

26:35.386 --> 26:37.837
Alright, come on.
Mind your head.

26:37.837 --> 26:39.390
That's it.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.197
I don't understand
she put this family.

26:53.197 --> 26:55.199
- Calm down.
- Don't you tell me to calm down.

26:55.199 --> 26:56.442
That is my wife
you're talking about.

26:56.442 --> 26:57.685
Everything
will be fine.

26:57.685 --> 26:59.307
Ugh!

26:59.928 --> 27:01.516
What, so this is it now?

27:01.516 --> 27:03.656
The rest of our lives
living a lie.

27:10.249 --> 27:12.009
Something's not right.

27:12.009 --> 27:15.944
Pearl, we've got a victim
who named her attacker.

27:15.944 --> 27:17.256
Then you found that
same attacker

27:17.256 --> 27:18.844
with the missing weapon.

27:18.844 --> 27:20.155
It's cut and dry.

27:20.155 --> 27:21.916
Now look, I haven't
got time for this.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.919
I've got a murder in Sheppey,
a pub robbery in Canterbury.

27:24.919 --> 27:27.162
I've been told to move on, alright?

27:27.162 --> 27:28.508
It doesn't make
any sense, though.

27:28.508 --> 27:30.131
It does.
You just don't want it to

27:30.131 --> 27:31.857
because you like her and
that's clouding your judgement.

27:31.857 --> 27:33.444
Oh don't start that again,
that I see the best in people.

27:33.444 --> 27:34.825
- What you talking about?
- You think the worst

27:34.825 --> 27:36.378
- of everyone.
- Oh.

27:36.378 --> 27:37.966
What about what I overheard?
Scott and Estella saying.

27:37.966 --> 27:39.554
He said he was sick
of living a lie.

27:39.554 --> 27:40.969
I mean, what if they tried
to kill Zelda

27:40.969 --> 27:43.316
so they could be together
and then frame Natalia

27:43.316 --> 27:44.559
so that she doesn't
inherit the money?

27:44.559 --> 27:46.699
Pearl!
Natalia's guilty.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.045
Zelda confirmed it.

27:48.045 --> 27:49.288
Yeah, but Zelda's old
and vulnerable.

27:49.288 --> 27:50.876
I mean, they could be
threatening her.

27:50.876 --> 27:52.705
I can't do this.
You done?

27:54.396 --> 27:57.054
Right, have you considered
that Zelda might be

27:57.054 --> 27:58.711
too scared to tell the truth?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.618
You all right?

28:13.139 --> 28:16.004
So, what did she say?

28:16.004 --> 28:18.213
I only see the worst in people.

28:18.213 --> 28:19.767
I'm a detective.
That's part of the job.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.216
I meant about the case.

28:21.216 --> 28:22.873
Uh, she thinks that

28:22.873 --> 28:26.083
Scott and Estella
are having an affair.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.326
What, they fight so much

28:27.326 --> 28:28.465
they must be sleeping
with each other?

28:28.465 --> 28:29.880
Something like that.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.296
Rings a bell.
Happy Birthday, by the way.

28:34.091 --> 28:35.299
What?

28:35.299 --> 28:37.094
It's five past midnight.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.509
How'd you know?

28:38.509 --> 28:40.097
I saw it on Facebook.

28:40.097 --> 28:42.513
I'm not on Facebook.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.965
Kat's organising
a surprise party.

28:45.965 --> 28:48.347
Nah, she wouldn't.

28:48.347 --> 28:49.969
It's fancy dress.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.768
Happy birthday!

29:06.434 --> 29:09.851
What's this about you going
to stay with your Dad?

29:09.851 --> 29:13.165
You-- you want to talk
about this now?

29:13.165 --> 29:15.167
Yeah.

29:15.167 --> 29:19.447
Okay, um, it's an adventure.
Before uni.

29:19.447 --> 29:20.897
And I'm the last one
to know about it?

29:20.897 --> 29:22.830
No, no, no, no,
Ruby doesn't even know yet.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.590
- Yeah, but Dolly does.
- Yeah, but you know Dolly.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.385
I mean, come on.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.387
She's like a mind reader.

29:28.387 --> 29:31.355
Pretty sure she was a witch
in her last life.

29:33.668 --> 29:35.808
Well, you're not a kid
anymore, are you?

29:35.808 --> 29:38.397
I can't stop you.

29:38.397 --> 29:40.571
No, no, I suppose not.

29:44.023 --> 29:46.370
Do you remember when you and
your mates used to sneak into

29:46.370 --> 29:48.959
Zelda St. John's mansion?

29:48.959 --> 29:50.581
Yeah.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.825
Yeah, I remember you used
to ground me because of it.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.896
I wish I could ground you now.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.212
How did you get in?

31:03.482 --> 31:05.070
Happy Birthday!

31:05.070 --> 31:07.313
- Oh, alright.
- Hey, come through.

31:09.074 --> 31:11.179
Take your jacket.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.528
Come and sit.
Come through.

31:17.634 --> 31:19.912
Come, sit.

31:26.712 --> 31:29.335
What's up? What do you keep
looking around for?

31:29.335 --> 31:31.199
I'm worried a load of people
I don't like

31:31.199 --> 31:33.581
are gonna jump out and shout
"Happy Birthday."

31:33.581 --> 31:35.100
What, like a surprise party?

31:35.100 --> 31:37.930
Yeah, Nikki says
you've planned one.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.932
You'd hate that.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.554
Besides, who would I invite?

31:41.554 --> 31:44.281
Exactly.
So there's no one here?

31:44.281 --> 31:47.181
No, I've ordered us a takeaway.

31:47.181 --> 31:49.148
And, um...

31:51.461 --> 31:54.636
Oh. Thanks.

31:59.676 --> 32:02.023
"We heard you need arrest."

32:04.681 --> 32:07.132
Oh, scratch cards.

32:07.132 --> 32:09.134
Perfect.

32:09.134 --> 32:12.620
If you lose, it affirms
your pessimistic world view.

32:12.620 --> 32:15.554
And if you win,
we retire in the sun.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.976
We're not giving any to charity.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.564
Or friends or family.

32:25.564 --> 32:27.807
Blow it all on a villa
in Barbados.

32:30.327 --> 32:31.984
Or we could buy that house.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.989
Did you go and see it?

32:38.197 --> 32:40.613
Maybe.

32:40.613 --> 32:42.236
And?

32:46.274 --> 32:49.795
I knew you'd love it.

32:49.795 --> 32:51.452
Oh, jackpot.

32:51.452 --> 32:53.523
How much?

32:53.523 --> 32:55.490
A quid.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.009
Well, it's a start.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.562
Yeah.

33:04.051 --> 33:06.018
We're really doing this, right?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.167
Well, go on. Keep going.

33:17.167 --> 33:20.170
The next one's got to
be a million.

33:20.170 --> 33:22.448
Yeah.

34:33.174 --> 34:35.142
So we'll put everything
into a trust

34:35.142 --> 34:37.144
for Scott and Estella.

34:37.144 --> 34:39.215
50/50 split.
With strict restrictions.

34:39.215 --> 34:41.700
I want strict limits
on how much they can spend.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.253
Of course.

34:43.253 --> 34:45.531
Left to their own
devices, the whole lot

34:45.531 --> 34:48.120
would be gone
before I'm even in the ground.

34:52.262 --> 34:53.505
There.

34:53.505 --> 34:55.472
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:35.616 --> 35:39.344
Oh, man.
I'm full as an egg.

35:39.344 --> 35:41.725
Do you want to hear
about my case?

35:41.725 --> 35:44.176
Oh, the high school sting?
Go on.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.798
It was a set up.

35:45.798 --> 35:47.179
You were right!

35:47.179 --> 35:49.216
The football captain's
best mate.

35:49.216 --> 35:51.390
- Ouch.
- They fell out over a boy.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.289
Well, I say boy.

35:53.289 --> 35:55.567
He's a 26-year-old drug dealer
who still lives with his mother.

35:55.567 --> 35:58.328
I said, "Girls, come on,
you're better than this."

35:58.328 --> 36:00.399
But no, apparently
he's quite the catch.

36:00.399 --> 36:02.367
Yeah, well,
bad boys always are.

36:02.367 --> 36:05.197
Yeah, a boyfriend like that
catapults you into

36:05.197 --> 36:07.026
the high school A-List.

36:08.821 --> 36:10.478
It's quite sad really.

36:10.478 --> 36:12.998
Throwing your friend under a bus
for a bit of attention.

36:12.998 --> 36:14.275
I spoke to the head about it.

36:14.275 --> 36:15.794
We're not gonna take it
any further.

36:15.794 --> 36:17.830
They're good kids.
You know, slap on the wrist.

36:17.830 --> 36:21.213
Bit of truth and reconciliation.
Let's move on.

36:38.092 --> 36:39.714
Sorry to gate crash.

36:44.788 --> 36:46.480
What are we celebrating?

36:46.480 --> 36:49.241
We've got a publisher
for Scott's book.

36:50.829 --> 36:53.590
It's a bidding war apparently.

36:53.590 --> 36:57.836
Well, it's amazing what
a bit of notoriety can do.

36:57.836 --> 37:00.804
There's rumours of
a television series, too.

37:00.804 --> 37:03.117
Mm, and a part for
Estella maybe?

37:03.117 --> 37:06.603
Oh, I was hoping for one for me.

37:06.603 --> 37:09.537
It's all in the book.

37:09.537 --> 37:14.059
200 pages about the '70s,
and then nothing.

37:14.059 --> 37:15.440
That book was clearly
Scott's attempt

37:15.440 --> 37:17.821
to put you
back in the limelight.

37:17.821 --> 37:19.616
Centre of attention.

37:19.616 --> 37:21.515
Zelda St. John the movie star.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.104
But you couldn't find
a publisher, could you?

37:25.104 --> 37:28.142
No one wanted it. No one could
remember who you were.

37:28.142 --> 37:30.731
So you needed a new plan.

37:30.731 --> 37:32.905
Something dramatic
and headline grabbing.

37:34.907 --> 37:36.875
Like attempted murder.

37:36.875 --> 37:40.465
Mm, murder sells.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.847
You set Natalia up.

37:43.847 --> 37:46.056
You changed your will
so there was a motive.

37:46.056 --> 37:49.439
And you staged that attack.

37:49.439 --> 37:50.958
Which one of them hit you?

37:50.958 --> 37:54.306
Was it Scott? Or Jed?
Or Estella?

37:54.306 --> 37:58.068
Because they're entirely
dependent on you.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.036
They'd do anything
you tell them, wouldn't they?

38:04.696 --> 38:07.871
Did one of them plant the award
on Natalia while she was asleep?

38:10.218 --> 38:13.118
You haven't got
a shred of evidence.

38:13.118 --> 38:15.327
Natalia could have
got rid of that award.

38:15.327 --> 38:16.673
She knew it incriminated her.

38:16.673 --> 38:18.330
But she didn't,
and do you know why?

38:18.330 --> 38:20.470
Because she knew
how much it meant to you.

38:23.162 --> 38:26.994
You set her up,
you framed her, and why?

38:26.994 --> 38:28.858
Huh?

38:28.858 --> 38:30.860
For fame?

38:30.860 --> 38:32.413
For celebrity?

38:35.692 --> 38:37.349
For my family.

38:48.705 --> 38:50.362
I'm dying.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.919
Really?

38:55.919 --> 38:57.749
They don't know.

38:59.509 --> 39:01.131
I've got months.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.827
This beautiful pile
is an illusion.

39:06.827 --> 39:08.967
It's mortgaged up to the hilt.

39:08.967 --> 39:12.867
The bank owns it.
I am sinking in debt.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.008
Scott's book was our last chance

39:16.008 --> 39:18.425
to make some money,
and nobody wanted it.

39:18.425 --> 39:20.461
Well...

39:20.461 --> 39:22.946
Now they do.

39:22.946 --> 39:25.880
Page turner of an ending.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.399
Sending an innocent person
to prison.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.401
That just doesn't matter?

39:29.401 --> 39:31.161
She's not family.

39:40.032 --> 39:41.655
Oh.

40:00.950 --> 40:03.435
How do I look?

40:03.435 --> 40:05.610
Ready for my close up?

41:52.613 --> 41:55.547
Listen, you've got to
stop doing this.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.963
- What?
- You know what.

41:58.688 --> 41:59.965
If it wasn't for me,
the wrong person

41:59.965 --> 42:02.002
would have gone to prison.

42:02.002 --> 42:05.212
Right, well, I'm not explaining
myself properly.

42:05.212 --> 42:08.733
We've got to stop doing this.
It's unprofessional.

42:08.733 --> 42:11.287
You coming to me with cases.
Me sharing evidence with you.

42:11.287 --> 42:12.806
I shared evidence with you.

42:12.806 --> 42:14.393
Look, there's proper channels, alright?

42:14.393 --> 42:17.051
Correct procedures.

42:17.051 --> 42:18.708
We don't even work together.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.710
Well, we kind of do actually.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.129
You don't think I can do this.

42:26.129 --> 42:27.959
I didn't say that.

42:29.443 --> 42:31.410
I know you can.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.621
I solved this case on my own.

42:34.621 --> 42:38.072
So keep doing that.
Just not my cases.

42:38.072 --> 42:39.349
It's too complicated.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.006
Why?

42:47.599 --> 42:49.601
Me and Kat are buying
a house together.

42:51.672 --> 42:54.606
Oh, you found somewhere?

42:54.606 --> 42:57.644
Yeah, I think so.

42:57.644 --> 42:59.266
Come on, you see what I mean.

42:59.266 --> 43:02.062
All this, it's got to stop.
