(<i> Laughs</i> ) I mean,
of course you mean me.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.305
No, I'd never do
something like that.

Dad, you can count on me.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.560
Sure, sure.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.856
Come on, Otto, I had to bail.
I had no choice.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.357
Had to?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.943
{\an3}You had to let Twister

You know how long
I'm grounded for?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.698
I knew Dad would ground me too

08:19.332 --> 08:20.374

and I knew
I couldn't get caught.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.921
It doesn't seem real fair
to them.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.047
But I guess it was
just bad luck, right?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.299
I guess.

Come on, Sam,

Okay, but go easy.

Your big day, you mean.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.028
I can't wait to bring home
that trophy

09:31.112 --> 09:32.405
so all three of us
can decide where to put it.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.283
That will be fun.
Breakfast?

09:35.366 --> 09:38.244
No, I don't want
to swim on a full stomach.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.620
I better just go.

They're all busy today,

10:02.852 --> 10:07.732
Oh? I thought they'd all be here
to root you on.

Is the race over already?

11:00.493 --> 11:03.287
I dropped out of the race.

Dad, I was in the kitchen
with Otto and Twister.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.625
I bailed because I didn't want
to be grounded

11:07.708 --> 11:09.960
from the triathlon.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.170
I wasn't sure
you'd ever tell me.

You knew?

Funny thing about chocolate,
makes a big mess.

for you to come clean,

and you did.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.644
I'm proud of you.

So, I guess all the guilt
I've had to suffer through

11:29.522 --> 11:31.482
has been punishment enough,
right?

11:31.565 --> 11:35.444
You're not getting
off the hook that easily.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.612
Since you kids
like sundaes so much,

11:36.695 --> 11:38.614
I thought
you'd like to make them

11:38.697 --> 11:39.865
for our customers
at the shack.
