00:36.912 --> 00:42.083
- Tempus, I never...
- Expected to see me?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.253
Of course not.
You were not worthy before now.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.089
What is the name
you are using here?

00:49.799 --> 00:52.802
- Rodriguez.
- Ah, yes.

00:52.969 --> 00:58.058
I've been sent to you, Rodriguez,
as a gift.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.102
- Sent? By who?
- I think you know who.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.146
And why.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.648
I can defeat the Charmed Ones
on my own.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.359
I don't need any help.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.111
Really?

01:10.278 --> 01:14.782
What makes you think you've actually
found the Charmed Ones?

01:14.949 --> 01:16.618
You kidding?

01:16.784 --> 01:19.245
After so many of my colleagues
had mysteriously vanished

01:19.412 --> 01:21.456
in San Francisco this year?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.291
There could only be one reason why.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.589
I posed as a cop because
I believed one was covering for them.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.009
And I was right, he was.
That's how I found them.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.344
But, of course, you already know
all that, don't you?

01:35.511 --> 01:37.847
It's what makes me
so worthy now, right?

01:38.264 --> 01:41.058
Watch your tongue, Rodriguez,
lest I split it for you.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.936
It's one thing to have found
the Charmed Ones,

01:44.103 --> 01:45.938
it's quite another to defeat them,

01:46.105 --> 01:49.859
as those who have gone before you
have already discovered.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.279
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

01:53.446 --> 01:58.576
I want you to get all three witches
together in one place by midnight,

01:58.743 --> 02:01.162
and give it your best shot.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.583
- But if you fail...
- I will not fail.

02:07.376 --> 02:10.755
Well, if you do,

02:10.920 --> 02:15.176
I'll be there to help you
learn by your failures.

02:15.926 --> 02:17.928
Trust me.

02:20.514 --> 02:23.684
Now, how do you expect
to get them together?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.395
Trudeau.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.245
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

02:43.412 --> 02:45.831
<i>It looks like it's going to be
a beautiful Wednesday...</i>

02:45.998 --> 02:48.792
Piper, what are you doing at Quake?
It's 8:00 in the morning.

02:48.959 --> 02:50.794
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:50.961 --> 02:54.757
All right. Yes, I'll be there
in an hour. Bye.

02:54.923 --> 02:56.884
You'll be where in an hour?

02:57.092 --> 02:59.470
Quake. Piper's doing that thing
for the Food Network,

02:59.636 --> 03:01.472
and she needs me to bring her
another dress

03:01.638 --> 03:04.558
because she spilled marinara sauce
all over the one she's wearing.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.810
- Just stay out of my closet.
- Oh, don't worry,

03:06.977 --> 03:08.896
don't think she'd want to ruin
another of yours.

03:09.062 --> 03:12.024
- I don't believe this.
- I'm kidding. Don't have an aneurysm.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.818
No, I'm talking about the paper.
Did you see the front page?

03:20.782 --> 03:23.327
Where did you park my car
last night?

03:23.493 --> 03:25.620
In the driveway, I think.

03:32.753 --> 03:35.255
- Mrs Henderson's car.
- Oh, thank God.

03:36.590 --> 03:40.135
I mean, that your car is in the driveway,
and I'm not in the doghouse.

03:40.302 --> 03:43.013
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, just a little fender-bender.

03:43.221 --> 03:44.431
No big deal.

03:44.598 --> 03:47.684
- Phoebe, Andy's in trouble.
- What? Why?

03:52.314 --> 03:55.525
They think that he killed
that Internal Affairs cop? No way!

03:55.692 --> 03:59.029
Maybe it's a setup trying to
force him to reveal our secret.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.739
Let me see that.

04:08.496 --> 04:10.415
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

04:13.126 --> 04:15.837
I saw Andy, Prue.

04:18.505 --> 04:20.550
He was dead.

06:00.065 --> 06:03.444
You said that you didn't see a demon
or a warlock in your premonition, right?

06:03.610 --> 06:06.947
No, but the way he was hurled across
the room, there had to have been one.

06:07.114 --> 06:09.158
- This room, here?
- Right here, yeah.

06:09.324 --> 06:10.951
Okay, and you're positive
it was Andy?

06:11.118 --> 06:13.287
- Prue...
- I just wanna be sure, all right.

06:13.453 --> 06:16.039
This isn't just anybody
that we're talking about, you know.

06:16.206 --> 06:19.626
- I know. And I care about him too.
- I know you do. I'm sorry.

06:21.169 --> 06:24.047
All right, why don't you fill in Piper,
and I'm gonna go warn Andy.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.842
How? He said it was too risky
for you to be seen with him.

06:27.009 --> 06:29.886
Well, I don't care. Let Internal Affairs
find out that we're witches.

06:30.053 --> 06:34.141
- Andy's life is a lot more important.
- Okay, just please be careful.

06:34.307 --> 06:36.810
We don't know what kind of demon
we're up against here.

06:40.355 --> 06:43.692
You ask me, I wouldn't be surprised
if Rodriguez whacked his own partner.

06:43.859 --> 06:45.110
IA already cleared him.

06:45.318 --> 06:47.946
- IA clearing IA. Go figure.
- Yeah.

06:50.824 --> 06:53.618
- What are you doing here, Morris?
- Backing my partner, Rodriguez.

06:53.785 --> 06:55.787
Something you wouldn't know
anything about.

06:56.663 --> 06:59.165
This is just between him and me.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.251
It's okay, Darryl.

07:08.967 --> 07:11.261
Just for the record,

07:11.720 --> 07:13.847
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer present.

07:14.431 --> 07:15.807
You don't need a lawyer.

07:16.266 --> 07:18.351
Not if you're willing to help me.

07:19.686 --> 07:21.813
You want me to help you?

07:23.982 --> 07:27.068
What, you can't frame me
yourself, Rodriguez?

07:27.527 --> 07:30.446
- Look, Andy...
- Oh, it's Andy now?

07:32.824 --> 07:36.744
I don't think you had anything to do
with my partner's murder. That's right.

07:36.911 --> 07:40.832
But what I do think
is completely off the record.

07:40.999 --> 07:43.543
And I think you'll understand why.

07:44.544 --> 07:48.756
It's my partner,
or at least what's left of him.

07:49.006 --> 07:51.968
No human could've
done that to him.

07:52.135 --> 07:55.680
I think he was killed
by something supernatural.

07:56.055 --> 07:58.391
And I think you can help me
figure out who or what it is.

07:58.558 --> 08:01.561
- Really? What makes you think that?
- Come on.

08:01.727 --> 08:04.272
I know all about those
unsolved cases of yours.

08:04.522 --> 08:07.567
And I know who's behind them too,
who you've been covering for.

08:07.733 --> 08:09.569
It's very noble.

08:10.486 --> 08:14.323
You must care about her very much
to give up your career for her.

08:15.116 --> 08:17.368
Prue Halliwell is a witch.

08:21.288 --> 08:23.249
A witch, huh?

08:23.582 --> 08:26.419
You wait here.
I'll go warn the Wizard of Oz.

08:27.002 --> 08:30.005
I don't have time
to screw around, Trudeau.

08:30.172 --> 08:32.466
I want you to arrange a meeting
between her and me.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.051
It has to be tonight.

08:34.217 --> 08:36.470
If she can help me find
who killed my partner,

08:36.636 --> 08:40.140
I'll drop all charges against you,
and I won't tell anybody about her.

08:40.307 --> 08:43.143
You think about it,
but not too long.

08:55.030 --> 08:58.325
- You all right?
- I'm not sure.

08:59.243 --> 09:00.703
I gotta go see Prue.

09:01.161 --> 09:05.541
That's funny. She called and said
she had to see you too.

09:30.607 --> 09:32.317
Well?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.528
I'm sure I made Trudeau
suspicious of me.

09:34.695 --> 09:37.823
He'll go to Prue, she'll have no choice
but to meet with me.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.867
But you have to get
all three of them together.

09:41.868 --> 09:45.497
Trudeau cares about her.
He won't let her risk meeting me alone.

09:45.914 --> 09:48.208
He'll insist she have
the power of three there with her.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.501
For protection.

09:49.668 --> 09:52.629
And you think you have the power
to defeat them all?

09:52.796 --> 09:54.965
You don't think I do, do you?

09:55.131 --> 09:58.426
- You think I'll fail.
- Time will tell.

10:04.057 --> 10:06.476
Phoebe, over here.

10:07.602 --> 10:10.897
Thank God. The segment producer's
gonna be here any minute,

10:11.064 --> 10:12.774
and I'm a complete and total wreck.

10:12.941 --> 10:14.859
I thought I was gonna
have to pull a Céline Dion

10:15.026 --> 10:17.862
- and wear my dress backwards.
- Piper, you've gotta listen to me.

10:18.029 --> 10:20.573
I had a premonition of Andy dying.

10:20.865 --> 10:23.159
- What? When?
- This morning.

10:23.326 --> 10:26.162
Don't you check your voice mail?
I called and said it was important.

10:26.329 --> 10:28.414
- Oh, no. Where's Prue?
- She's warning him.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.875
In the meantime, we have to
figure out who the demon is.

10:31.292 --> 10:33.253
Piper?

10:33.628 --> 10:35.505
Piper Halliwell?

10:36.256 --> 10:40.927
I would recognise you anywhere.
You have not changed one bit.

10:41.261 --> 10:43.262
You don't recognise me, do you?

10:44.597 --> 10:45.932
It's Joanne.

10:48.518 --> 10:51.312
Joanne Hertz.
Baker High, class of '92.

10:51.479 --> 10:54.774
Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne.

10:56.025 --> 10:59.112
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the segment producer.

11:00.029 --> 11:03.199
You're the segment producer?
She's the segment producer.

11:03.366 --> 11:04.575
I heard.

11:04.951 --> 11:08.955
Wow, what a small world.
I thought you moved to New York.

11:09.455 --> 11:12.375
I did, and that's where I met
my fabulous husband,

11:12.542 --> 11:15.044
who had this crazy idea
about starting this little cable show,

11:15.211 --> 11:16.754
and putting me in charge
of everything.

11:16.921 --> 11:20.257
And here we are, the Food Network's
most popular show.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.301
Talk about dreams coming true.

11:22.468 --> 11:25.846
Anyway, enough about me,
what have you been doing?

11:30.810 --> 11:33.437
- Why'd you do that?
- What am I supposed to say?

11:33.604 --> 11:36.148
That I'm a cash-strapped,
single restaurant manager

11:36.315 --> 11:38.984
who still lives in the same house
I grew up in with my sisters?

11:39.151 --> 11:41.821
- And the cat. Don't forget our cat.
- Phoebe, this isn't funny.

11:41.987 --> 11:45.491
Look, I don't know why you're getting
so upset. She is a freak.

11:45.824 --> 11:48.661
I'm sorry, but no one is
that successful at age 26.

11:48.827 --> 11:50.579
Besides, you are successful.

11:50.746 --> 11:52.831
You're talented, you're creative,

11:52.998 --> 11:54.959
and the Food Network
is here to see you.

11:55.125 --> 11:58.545
Not me, not her, you.

11:59.088 --> 12:01.507
- Feel better now?
- Very little.

12:01.674 --> 12:04.051
Good. Unfreeze that bitch in heels.

12:04.218 --> 12:07.221
You've got a segment to shoot,
and we've got a demon to find.

12:08.347 --> 12:11.600
Has Phoebe ever been wrong
about her premonitions before?

12:11.767 --> 12:14.394
No. But the good news is,
every other time,

12:14.561 --> 12:16.104
we've been able
to affect the outcome.

12:16.271 --> 12:19.566
- Stop the demon or warlock before...
- Before I get killed.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.610
Can I get that in writing?

12:21.777 --> 12:24.196
Andy, you just have to be
extra careful

12:24.363 --> 12:28.825
until we figure out who this demon is
and why he's after you, okay?

12:30.494 --> 12:32.245
Andy?

12:32.412 --> 12:36.333
I was just thinking,
what if the demon is Rodriguez?

12:37.042 --> 12:38.335
Why would you say that?

12:38.877 --> 12:40.879
He pulled me into the station house
this morning.

12:41.046 --> 12:42.714
I thought he was gonna arrest me,

12:42.881 --> 12:44.966
but what he really wanted
was a meeting with you.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.218
Meet with me? Why?

12:46.385 --> 12:48.637
He thinks his partner was killed
by a supernatural being

12:48.804 --> 12:52.432
and somehow, I don't know how, Prue,
he knows you're a witch.

12:54.059 --> 12:56.978
- How would he know that, unless...?
- Unless he's the demon.

13:00.941 --> 13:06.029
All right, tell Rodriguez to meet me
at the manor at 6:00.

13:06.196 --> 13:09.032
- It's too dangerous, Prue.
- I don't have a choice.

13:09.199 --> 13:12.410
If I don't meet with him,
he'll frame you and try and expose me.

13:12.577 --> 13:14.746
But if he is a demon,
and it turns out to be a trap?

13:14.913 --> 13:17.666
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

13:17.832 --> 13:23.797
- Plus one. Me.
- No, you can't be there, Andy.

13:24.839 --> 13:28.051
That's where you were
in Phoebe's premonition when...

13:30.261 --> 13:33.681
Just promise me you'll stay away.

13:34.682 --> 13:37.393
- I can't do that, Prue.
- I mean it.

13:39.354 --> 13:41.231
Don't make me use my magic on you.

13:46.069 --> 13:48.112
I don't want anything
to happen to you, Andy.

13:49.572 --> 13:52.450
You know how much
I still care for you.

13:52.784 --> 13:55.328
Okay. I promise.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.485
All right, let's go over
the plan again.

14:27.652 --> 14:30.488
Yeah, let's, because I wanna know
why I'm the one answering the door.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.990
Because you're the one
who knows martial arts, all right.

14:33.157 --> 14:35.576
If Rodriguez shows up
and tries something right off the bat,

14:35.743 --> 14:36.786
you can knock him down.

14:36.952 --> 14:39.163
Then I can come in from
the living room and freeze him.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.749
And I can come down the stairs
and send him flying.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.667
Still feel like cannon fodder.

14:46.337 --> 14:49.465
- What time is it?
- Just before 6.

14:52.384 --> 14:54.595
That's a little too anxious.
That's not a good sign.

14:54.762 --> 14:58.849
Which means if he doesn't wanna
kill Prue, he wants to date her.

15:00.392 --> 15:03.020
All right, come on,
let's get this day over with.

15:03.187 --> 15:04.480
Okay.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.275
All right already.

15:09.485 --> 15:12.029
Inspector Rodriguez.
I'm here to see Prue Halliwell.

15:12.196 --> 15:13.864
Yeah, no kidding.

15:14.031 --> 15:17.493
Prue, Piper, company.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.005
Phoebe!

15:32.758 --> 15:33.842
Phoebe.

15:41.516 --> 15:43.310
Oh, my God.

15:43.602 --> 15:47.773
- Oh, God, Phoebe.
- Prue, is she okay?

15:53.695 --> 15:54.946
She's dead.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.324
What?

15:57.491 --> 15:59.201
Phoebe!

15:59.367 --> 16:01.077
Phoebe!

16:41.159 --> 16:42.994
Hurts to die, doesn't it?

16:44.078 --> 16:46.080
Especially at the hands of a witch.

16:46.789 --> 16:50.084
Wait. What happened?
Where am I?

16:50.251 --> 16:54.047
Exactly where you were
when you first met me.

16:54.213 --> 16:57.967
Time has been reset.
Or, rather, I have reset time.

16:58.134 --> 17:00.553
But they killed me.

17:01.721 --> 17:07.977
That was Wednesday night, this is
Wednesday morning all over again.

17:08.144 --> 17:10.730
This is why I have been sent to you:

17:10.896 --> 17:14.233
To keep resetting time
until you learn from your failures.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.988
Only you will carry with you the
memory of what has happened before.

17:19.155 --> 17:22.366
And each time you fail,
you will learn more

17:22.532 --> 17:27.121
until, ultimately,
you will kill all of them.

17:40.176 --> 17:41.343
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

17:41.510 --> 17:43.971
<i>It looks like it's going to be
a beautiful Wednesday...</i>

17:44.138 --> 17:48.559
Piper, what are you doing at Quake?
It's 8:00 in the morning.

17:48.726 --> 17:51.562
- Morning.
- Morning.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.606
Wait a minute.

17:57.193 --> 17:59.486
I am freaking out.

18:00.196 --> 18:02.031
Okay, I'll be there in an hour.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.325
Be where in an hour?

18:06.785 --> 18:08.537
- Okay, pinch me.
- What?

18:08.704 --> 18:11.582
No, I mean it, pinch me.
I wanna make sure I'm awake.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.002
Because if I am,
I am having one killer déjà vu.

18:15.169 --> 18:17.171
So it's just a déjà vu.
Everybody gets them.

18:17.337 --> 18:22.050
Not like this, they don't. Look, Prue,
something weird is going on here.

18:22.217 --> 18:25.053
- I don't believe this.
- No, trust me, okay.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.181
This has happened before.
Everything!

18:27.347 --> 18:29.725
I'm talking about the paper.
Did you see the front page?

18:29.892 --> 18:34.688
See? Like that, right there.
You said that before, I know it.

18:36.356 --> 18:38.692
Okay, and that has happened
before too.

18:38.859 --> 18:40.527
Where did you park my car
last night?

18:40.694 --> 18:44.698
In the driveway. And I told you that
already the last time you asked me.

18:46.783 --> 18:49.494
I think I'm having an aneurysm.

18:51.371 --> 18:52.622
Mrs Henderson's car.

18:53.331 --> 18:56.209
Just a little fender-bender.
No big deal.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.836
Prue, I am not nuts.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.047
Okay, maybe just a little,
but that's irrelevant here.

19:01.256 --> 19:03.216
- Phoebe, Andy's in trouble.
- What?

19:07.762 --> 19:09.472
Let me see that.

19:17.147 --> 19:20.609
Now, that was a premonition
which I've had before.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.236
- Of what?
- Of Andy, here...

19:23.862 --> 19:25.530
...being killed by a demon.

19:36.499 --> 19:38.418
- What are you doing here?
- Backing my partner.

19:38.585 --> 19:40.795
- You got a problem with that?
- Get out. Now!

19:45.633 --> 19:46.968
It's okay, Darryl. I got it.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.854
Just for the record,

19:58.396 --> 20:00.440
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer present.

20:00.606 --> 20:02.817
Forget your lawyer.
I'm not screwing around this time.

20:03.109 --> 20:05.778
This time?
What are you talking about?

20:06.279 --> 20:09.991
Bottom line, I know my partner
was killed by a supernatural being,

20:10.158 --> 20:12.660
and I think Prue Halliwell
can help me figure out who did it.

20:12.827 --> 20:14.203
Really?

20:14.454 --> 20:16.372
I'll just get the commissioner
to signal Batman

20:16.539 --> 20:18.332
and then I'll get right on it.

20:18.916 --> 20:21.460
You think I'm joking?
I know everything, Trudeau.

20:21.627 --> 20:23.963
Including the fact that
Prue Halliwell is a witch.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.549
You're gonna arrange a meeting
with her tonight, understand?

20:26.716 --> 20:29.218
Or else I'm gonna bust your ass
and expose hers.

20:37.893 --> 20:40.021
- What was that about?
- I'm not sure.

21:00.332 --> 21:02.793
- Well?
- Trudeau will set to meet,

21:03.294 --> 21:06.922
but what I need to know is how to avoid
the pain of getting vanquished again.

21:07.089 --> 21:10.217
Depends on whether you've learned
enough to vanquish them first.

21:10.384 --> 21:11.427
What do you remember?

21:11.594 --> 21:14.555
Last time, I killed the youngest one,
Phoebe, without a fight.

21:14.722 --> 21:17.558
But then when I turned to kill Piper...

21:17.725 --> 21:19.727
I think she's the one
who has the power to freeze.

21:19.893 --> 21:20.978
Adjust.

21:21.145 --> 21:23.814
Simply anticipate where
she's coming from earlier,

21:23.981 --> 21:27.568
before she has the chance
to freeze you.

21:27.735 --> 21:29.945
Then kill Prue.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.744
Andy dies?
Are you sure that's what you saw?

21:37.911 --> 21:41.290
Even worse, I know that I've had
the same premonition before.

21:41.456 --> 21:44.459
I mean, before I had it earlier today.

21:44.626 --> 21:49.131
- You mean, like yesterday?
- Yes. I mean, no.

21:50.257 --> 21:52.968
It's not just the premonition
I've seen before, it's everything.

21:53.135 --> 21:56.013
And don't tell me that it's just déjà vu,
because I know that it's not.

21:56.179 --> 21:59.182
- Okay, all right, then what is it?
- Piper?

22:01.017 --> 22:02.352
Piper Halliwell?

22:02.519 --> 22:07.732
I would recognise you anywhere.
You have not changed one bit.

22:07.899 --> 22:10.110
You don't recognise me, do you?

22:10.277 --> 22:12.279
- It's...
- Joanne.

22:12.445 --> 22:16.116
Joanne Hertz, right?

22:16.283 --> 22:19.160
- I'm right, aren't I?
- I'm sorry, have we met?

22:19.327 --> 22:22.455
Yes. I mean, sort of. Before.

22:23.957 --> 22:29.337
Baker High, class of '92.
Although, I wasn't in that class.

22:29.504 --> 22:32.799
Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne.

22:32.966 --> 22:35.719
- Phoebe, how did you...?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

22:35.885 --> 22:39.013
I think we're in some
funky time loop here.

22:40.807 --> 22:42.976
- Phoebe.
- Freeze her. I'll show you.

22:44.561 --> 22:47.439
Okay, Joanne here is
the Food Network segment producer.

22:47.605 --> 22:50.984
She's about to brag how she's
happily married to some rich guy,

22:51.151 --> 22:55.196
how she's following her dreams,
how she's had a really bad nose job.

22:55.363 --> 22:57.198
Okay, I added the last part.

22:57.365 --> 22:59.158
But this is all gonna make
you feel like

22:59.325 --> 23:02.161
you're wasting your life away
in comparison.

23:02.328 --> 23:04.205
Unfreeze her.
Go ahead, see for yourself.

23:07.250 --> 23:12.088
- Are you the segment producer?
- Why, yes, I am.

23:12.505 --> 23:16.259
Following your dreams, are you?
Happily married? Stinking rich?

23:17.635 --> 23:21.472
- Well, I don't mean to brag, but...
- Oh, God.

23:22.515 --> 23:23.975
All right, Phoebe, spill it.

23:24.142 --> 23:26.644
Okay, the best I can figure is
some demon has cast a spell,

23:26.811 --> 23:28.604
and I'm the only one
who can sort of see it

23:28.771 --> 23:32.400
because my power lets me see things
that have happened in different times.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.485
- Do you have a better explanation?
- No.

23:34.986 --> 23:36.404
All right, so if you're right,

23:36.571 --> 23:38.948
you think this has something to do
with Andy being killed?

23:39.156 --> 23:42.118
I don't know, but we'll never find who
the demon is unless we get to...

23:42.285 --> 23:44.954
<i>Book of Shadows.
I'm right behind you.</i>

23:45.287 --> 23:47.456
What if he is a demon,
and it turns out to be a trap?

23:47.623 --> 23:50.376
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

23:50.543 --> 23:52.211
Plus one. Me.

23:54.213 --> 23:55.256
What is it?

23:55.423 --> 23:58.467
This seems a little familiar to me,
that's all. Kind of like déjà vu.

24:00.678 --> 24:02.471
Never mind.

24:03.389 --> 24:05.182
Andy, you can't be at the meeting.

24:05.349 --> 24:07.852
In Phoebe's premonition,
that's where you were when...

24:09.854 --> 24:12.189
Just promise me
that you'll stay away.

24:12.773 --> 24:15.526
- Prue, I can't do that.
- I mean it.

24:15.859 --> 24:17.611
Don't make me use my magic on you.

24:23.325 --> 24:26.495
Andy, I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

24:29.331 --> 24:31.792
You know how much I still love you.

24:36.046 --> 24:37.631
No...

24:38.549 --> 24:39.758
...I didn't.

25:09.371 --> 25:10.789
Anything in there about time loops?

25:10.956 --> 25:12.916
A spell to accelerate time,
that's about it.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.544
I'm telling you,
this is all part of his evil plan.

25:15.710 --> 25:19.464
I just haven't had enough time
to figure it out yet.

25:19.923 --> 25:23.260
- What time is it?
- Just before 6.

25:24.886 --> 25:26.304
I'll get it.

25:30.225 --> 25:31.977
All right already.

25:33.812 --> 25:35.271
Phoebe!

25:53.123 --> 25:55.250
Oh, my God, no!

25:59.295 --> 26:01.130
Piper!

26:29.659 --> 26:31.744
Son of a bitch!

26:32.703 --> 26:35.414
- Failed again, I see.
- Yeah, but I learned.

26:35.581 --> 26:39.168
This time I got two of them.
Third time is the charm.

26:52.598 --> 26:54.141
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

26:54.392 --> 26:57.561
<i>It looks like it's going to be a beautiful
Wednesday in the Bay Area...</i>

26:58.270 --> 26:59.855
Don't tell me, I already know.

27:00.022 --> 27:03.192
You spilled marinara sauce
on your dress, right? Am I right?

27:03.359 --> 27:06.904
Think, Piper, think. Doesn't all of this
seem awfully familiar to you?

27:07.071 --> 27:08.614
- Morning.
- Freeze.

27:09.281 --> 27:10.658
No, not you, Piper.

27:10.825 --> 27:13.994
Kit knocks over pepper, meows.

27:16.288 --> 27:17.414
Hold that thought.

27:17.581 --> 27:20.125
Okay, Piper, you need to get home
as soon as you can.

27:20.292 --> 27:22.211
Okay, we've got major
demon hunting to do.

27:22.378 --> 27:25.130
Oh, and if you run into someone
named Joanne from high school,

27:25.297 --> 27:28.926
just tell her to go stick it.
I will explain later, just hurry.

27:30.511 --> 27:32.763
- Okay, what's going on?
- Quick, follow me.

27:44.650 --> 27:48.362
Five, four, three, two, one.

27:48.529 --> 27:52.241
Car honks, skids, crashes.

27:53.450 --> 27:56.662
Mrs Henderson's car,
a little fender-bender.

27:56.828 --> 27:59.081
Good thing I parked your car
in the driveway last night.

27:59.248 --> 28:00.374
How did you know that?

28:00.540 --> 28:02.459
Because this has all happened
once before, Prue.

28:02.626 --> 28:04.086
Maybe even more than once.

28:04.252 --> 28:07.714
The day keeps repeating itself.
I know it.

28:07.881 --> 28:11.635
And every time it happens, I think
I figure it out just a little bit faster.

28:12.135 --> 28:15.013
It must be my power of premonition.

28:15.806 --> 28:17.474
Premonition.

28:17.641 --> 28:20.560
I'm supposed to be having
a premonition right about now.

28:20.769 --> 28:22.854
Supposed to? What do you mean?

28:23.313 --> 28:26.233
The paper. Look at the front page.

28:30.695 --> 28:32.697
- Andy...
- Is in trouble.

28:32.864 --> 28:34.074
More than you know, Prue.

28:34.699 --> 28:38.078
If I touch that paper,
I will have a premonition.

28:38.244 --> 28:39.955
The same one that I've had before,

28:40.121 --> 28:44.292
where Andy gets killed, here,
by a demon.

28:44.709 --> 28:46.628
You have got to believe me.

28:46.836 --> 28:49.214
No, I believe you. The question is,
what do we do about it?

28:49.381 --> 28:51.383
Well, you've gotta go warn Andy.

28:51.549 --> 28:53.468
Keep him away from our house
at all costs.

28:53.635 --> 28:55.804
<i>Meanwhile, I've gotta dig through
the Book of Shadows,</i>

28:55.970 --> 28:59.057
find a way to vanquish this time demon
before he can kill Andy.

29:12.654 --> 29:14.739
You really shouldn't have done that.

29:14.906 --> 29:19.077
You shouldn't do anything differently
if you expect to succeed tonight.

29:19.243 --> 29:21.996
I will succeed tonight, old man.

29:22.163 --> 29:23.623
There will be no more time loops.

29:23.790 --> 29:26.376
This time I'll kill Prue first
and then the other two.

29:26.542 --> 29:27.919
And when they die,

29:28.086 --> 29:32.924
they're gonna feel every ounce of pain
they've given me and then some.

29:37.386 --> 29:40.348
Joanne, I'm so sorry,
but I can't do this segment right now.

29:40.515 --> 29:43.351
Something's happened.
Something bad. I have to go.

29:43.684 --> 29:46.854
What? Run out of marinara sauce?

29:47.021 --> 29:48.272
Kidding.

29:48.648 --> 29:52.944
Look, I know I don't have
the flashy job or the flashy ring

29:53.110 --> 29:54.278
or the flashy designer suit,

29:54.445 --> 29:56.989
but that doesn't make me
less than you or anybody else.

29:57.156 --> 29:59.575
And just because I may not
have realised my dreams yet

29:59.742 --> 30:02.912
like you think you have, doesn't mean
I won't find a way to do exactly that.

30:03.079 --> 30:06.040
And when I do, you can be damn sure
I'll be doing it with my own nose

30:06.207 --> 30:09.418
and not the one
some discount doctor gave me.

30:12.838 --> 30:16.050
A time loop? You mean demons can
actually do that sort of thing?

30:16.217 --> 30:18.427
None that I've ever seen before.
But if it is a demon,

30:18.594 --> 30:21.138
it's the most powerful one
that we've ever come up against.

30:21.305 --> 30:23.974
And he's going through all this
just to kill me?

30:24.141 --> 30:26.101
No way, Prue.

30:26.268 --> 30:29.104
If he's as powerful as you say,
then he's gotta be after you.

30:29.313 --> 30:30.356
Please let us handle this.

30:30.522 --> 30:33.192
Whatever you do, promise me
that you'll stay away from the manor.

30:33.359 --> 30:35.235
I can't promise you that.

30:35.402 --> 30:38.614
If you're right and Rodriguez
is the demon, then it's a trap.

30:38.781 --> 30:41.867
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

30:42.034 --> 30:43.744
What if he wants all three
of you together?

30:43.911 --> 30:45.579
If that's the reason he
set the time loop?

30:45.746 --> 30:48.373
- We'll have to take our chances.
- You could get killed, Prue.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.751
I mean it. This is not your fight.

30:50.918 --> 30:53.504
Don't make me use my magic on you.

30:54.546 --> 30:56.840
Andy, I would die
if anything happened to you.

30:58.425 --> 31:00.052
I love you.

31:01.595 --> 31:03.305
I love you too, Prue.

31:33.168 --> 31:34.544
Oh, my God! Prue!

31:37.589 --> 31:42.886
The devil's sorcerer, Tempus, he can
manipulate time any way he chooses.

31:43.053 --> 31:45.013
Does it say how to vanquish him?

31:45.305 --> 31:50.018
Take him out of the time that he's in,
whatever that means.

31:58.318 --> 31:59.819
No!

32:00.820 --> 32:02.238
Andy!

32:15.418 --> 32:19.130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Is Prue okay?

32:20.298 --> 32:22.508
Yeah. She's out cold.

32:35.188 --> 32:36.981
Oh, my God.

32:37.190 --> 32:39.066
He's dead.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.671
The only reason you're still alive

33:00.838 --> 33:04.216
is because I haven't figured out
how to kill you yet.

33:04.383 --> 33:08.554
Go ahead, kill me, witch.
I don't care.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.098
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to save Andy.

33:11.265 --> 33:14.101
Andy? Andy's dead.
You can't save him, Phoebe.

33:14.268 --> 33:16.479
No? We're in a time loop, aren't we?

33:16.645 --> 33:19.565
All we have to do is start
this day over, and Andy lives.

33:20.858 --> 33:26.030
And I'm willing to bet that his death
somehow triggers the time loop.

33:26.197 --> 33:29.366
I'm impressed.
I was told you wouldn't know that.

33:29.533 --> 33:30.951
Really?

33:31.201 --> 33:32.912
By who?

33:34.204 --> 33:37.583
Tempus? Yeah,
we know about him too,

33:37.875 --> 33:40.127
and we also know
that you're not him.

33:40.294 --> 33:43.130
Otherwise, you would've restarted
the day by now.

33:43.297 --> 33:46.925
- So where do we find him?
- In your nightmares.

33:49.053 --> 33:50.596
Kill me.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.723
I dare you.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.687
Why is he so willing
to let us kill him?

33:58.854 --> 34:01.315
Who cares? He dies, Andy lives.
End of story.

34:01.481 --> 34:03.483
What if that's exactly his plan?

34:03.650 --> 34:06.111
To reset the day
and he can kill us all next?

34:06.278 --> 34:09.697
Doesn't matter. The day's gonna
reset itself anyway,

34:09.864 --> 34:12.074
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop it.

34:12.242 --> 34:14.453
Shut up. Come on,
we have to wake up Prue.

34:16.705 --> 34:18.373
Prue.

34:18.540 --> 34:21.543
Prue, come on,
we need your help.

34:21.710 --> 34:24.880
<i>- Prue.
- Prue. Prue.</i>

34:25.047 --> 34:27.382
<i>Come to me, Prue.</i>

34:28.675 --> 34:31.844
Andy, what's going on?
Where are we?

34:33.513 --> 34:34.848
I'm not quite sure, really.

34:35.306 --> 34:38.685
I hoped I'd end up here,
but not so soon.

34:39.561 --> 34:41.813
One thing I do know, though,
is that I'm staying.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.733
You're not.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.525
I don't understand.

34:49.529 --> 34:51.822
I broke my promise, Prue.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.491
I came to your house tonight.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.371
Turns out Phoebe's premonition
was one you couldn't stop after all.

34:58.538 --> 35:00.999
Weren't supposed to stop.

35:01.583 --> 35:06.212
- Wait a minute, Andy, no.
- It's okay, Prue, really.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.506
Trust me.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.843
This is my destiny, I know that now.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.388
Yours is to continue on.

35:15.555 --> 35:18.683
Everything happens for a reason,
remember? You taught me that.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.603
- This isn't fair.
- You need to go back.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.022
You need to keep the time loop
from being reset again,

35:24.188 --> 35:26.774
or you and your sisters
will be killed,

35:27.025 --> 35:28.985
and I will have died in vain.

35:29.485 --> 35:32.697
- I'll kill Rodriguez for this.
- No, you won't.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.282
You're not a murderer, Prue.

35:34.490 --> 35:36.576
You're a good person
who does good things.

35:36.743 --> 35:41.581
- I don't wanna lose you.
- Don't worry, you won't.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.218
I'll always be there for you, Prue.

36:01.183 --> 36:03.185
<i>Prue.</i>

36:09.734 --> 36:11.569
Prue, come on, wake up, sweetie.
Come on.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.154
Come on, we need your help.
Come on.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.281
Easy, easy, easy.

36:15.448 --> 36:18.242
- Okay.
- Where's Andy?

36:18.409 --> 36:20.911
Prue, something terrible
has happened.

36:23.330 --> 36:24.915
Oh, my God.

36:25.833 --> 36:27.418
It all happened so fast, Prue.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.753
He ran in the door
when Rodriguez attacked.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.506
He was trying to save us.

36:36.552 --> 36:38.762
And he'll succeed.

36:38.929 --> 36:42.308
<i>- Where's the Book of Shadows?
- It's right here.</i>

36:47.730 --> 36:48.772
Why?

36:48.939 --> 36:52.067
Where's the spell that you saw
to accelerate time?

36:52.234 --> 36:53.986
- What are you doing?
- There.

36:54.153 --> 36:55.195
What's going on?

36:55.362 --> 36:57.448
We don't wanna accelerate time,
we wanna reverse it.

36:57.614 --> 36:59.741
No, we don't, trust me.
The only chance that we have

36:59.908 --> 37:03.537
to get rid of Tempus is to do this
by breaking the time loop, okay?

37:03.704 --> 37:06.915
But if we break the time loop,
we won't be able to save Andy.

37:07.082 --> 37:09.668
- I know.
- Prue, are you sure?

37:10.377 --> 37:12.421
No, I'm not.

37:15.132 --> 37:18.510
<i>"Winds of time, gather round
Give me wings to speed my way"</i>

37:18.677 --> 37:19.720
Wait a minute.

37:19.928 --> 37:24.141
<i>"Rush me on my journey forward
Let tomorrow be today"</i>

37:24.558 --> 37:25.642
What's happening?

37:42.242 --> 37:44.494
No!

37:59.301 --> 38:00.719
Prue?

38:07.767 --> 38:10.645
You know what, just untie him.
Get him out of here.

38:10.854 --> 38:13.273
What? He'll kill us!

38:13.440 --> 38:15.817
No, he won't.
He doesn't have the power to kill us.

38:16.025 --> 38:17.902
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
needed Tempus.

38:18.069 --> 38:20.488
I will not untie him, Prue.

38:26.452 --> 38:28.204
Get out of here
before I change my mind.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.248
You stupid witch.

39:07.076 --> 39:10.037
We may not be murderers,
but we're no angels either.

40:58.812 --> 41:00.063
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

41:00.230 --> 41:02.732
<i>Well, it looks like it's going to be
a gorgeous Monday morning</i>

41:02.899 --> 41:04.401
<i>here in the Bay Area...</i>

41:05.151 --> 41:08.196
She really needs another shtick,
that one's getting boring.

41:08.363 --> 41:11.074
Maybe she should hire Joanne Hertz,
boost her ratings.

41:11.241 --> 41:13.660
Speaking of the she-devil herself,

41:13.827 --> 41:15.912
did you ever call
to reschedule your segment?

41:16.079 --> 41:17.664
No, I'm not going to.

41:17.872 --> 41:20.375
- Why?
- I've decided to quit my job.

41:20.583 --> 41:21.793
What?

41:21.960 --> 41:24.379
And, actually, I owe it all to Joanne.

41:24.546 --> 41:26.840
She made me realise
that somehow I'd forgotten

41:27.006 --> 41:28.842
what my dreams were.
Still are.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.469
I always wanted to be a chef
and have my own restaurant,

41:31.636 --> 41:32.887
not manage one.

41:33.054 --> 41:36.266
It's a good job and the pay's okay,
but it's not my dream job.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.519
I think that's great. I really do.

41:39.852 --> 41:45.942
And don't worry, if you need any help
trolling the classifieds, I am an expert.

41:54.992 --> 41:57.912
Prue? Are you all right?

41:58.079 --> 42:00.957
Yeah, actually, I am.

42:01.457 --> 42:04.627
Andy's been exonerated.
They're now looking for Rodriguez.

42:04.794 --> 42:06.629
Good luck.

42:07.421 --> 42:09.966
Hey, are you sure you're all right?

42:10.132 --> 42:11.759
Yeah.

42:12.134 --> 42:14.303
I was just thinking about
all that we've been through

42:14.470 --> 42:16.514
since we became witches.

42:16.681 --> 42:18.224
- Give you a headache?
- No, actually.

42:18.391 --> 42:20.142
It gave me a good feeling.

42:20.309 --> 42:21.727
I mean, look, it's a hassle

42:21.894 --> 42:23.813
and can sometimes screw up
our personal lives...

42:23.979 --> 42:28.359
- Amen to that.
- And we do good things together.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.237
It helps offset the bad things.

42:33.614 --> 42:35.658
I'm gonna really miss Andy.

42:36.826 --> 42:38.744
It's gonna be very sad without him.

42:40.913 --> 42:43.457
Something tells me
that he'll always be with us.

42:48.003 --> 42:50.381
We better get ready for work.

42:53.634 --> 42:54.802
I'll tell her later.

42:55.010 --> 42:57.096
- Tell me what?
- Nothing. It's not important.

42:57.262 --> 43:00.474
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
