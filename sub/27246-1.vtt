01:49.692 --> 01:51.611
Why, look at the time.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.072
It's almost midnight.

01:55.823 --> 01:58.075
Very nearly the witching hour.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.040
Time enough
for one more story about Sabrina,

02:04.915 --> 02:06.543
as she takes one more step

02:06.626 --> 02:09.294
towards fulfilling
the Dark Lord's Prophecy.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.883
It's a wonder anyone in Greendale
was surprised by what happened

02:12.966 --> 02:14.384
the night of the "storm."

02:15.051 --> 02:16.719
All the signs were there...

02:18.555 --> 02:20.056
if you knew where to look.

02:21.098 --> 02:24.311
<i>A dead bird brought in by a cat.</i>

02:26.271 --> 02:28.522
<i>A spilled bottle of black ink.</i>

02:30.150 --> 02:33.152
<i>A broken mirror in an empty room.</i>

02:34.570 --> 02:37.783
<i>A loaf of bread split
clean down the middle.</i>

02:37.865 --> 02:39.158
Bloody hell.

02:39.867 --> 02:42.996
<i>A blind woman knits
her own death shroud,</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:44.914
<i>aware of what's coming.</i>

02:46.375 --> 02:47.375
Nana.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.129
It's like you predicted.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.676
I have started to see things.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.554
Impossible things.

03:02.431 --> 03:04.518
One of the things that I saw...

03:06.103 --> 03:07.812
Any sign of Tommy?

03:10.816 --> 03:13.068
I think my friend, Sabrina Spellman...

03:14.568 --> 03:15.568
is a witch.

03:16.278 --> 03:17.278
Could be.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.158
Could very well be.

03:21.325 --> 03:27.123
Nana, you said
that witches cursed us Walker women...

03:27.873 --> 03:30.001
and that's why so many of us are blind.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.045
So the story goes.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.257
Was it a Spellman who cursed our family?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.466
Oh, no, child.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.554
Don't think such dark thoughts.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.264
You know your friend.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.266
You know in your heart
if she's good or bad,

03:45.349 --> 03:49.020
and you don't need the cunning
to tell you that.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.563
The thing is...

03:52.899 --> 03:55.526
I'm not sure anymore.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.197
Just look at her...

04:00.407 --> 04:01.824
and you will know.

04:02.491 --> 04:03.826
Besides...

04:05.954 --> 04:09.750
what the cunning tells me is that...

04:10.125 --> 04:15.212
your friend is not the witch
you need to fear.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.968
The thirteen are coming, child.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.512
Like the wrath of...

04:24.305 --> 04:25.389
not God...

04:26.307 --> 04:29.478
but something near as powerful,

04:29.560 --> 04:32.355
only twisted.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.024
The thirteen?

04:34.106 --> 04:35.192
Witches.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.781
And may the Lord have mercy on our souls.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.418
Blast it!

04:54.336 --> 04:55.711
Someone's having a baby.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.673
What? What in Satan's name
are you talking about, Hilda?

04:58.757 --> 05:01.425
You know the saying.
"If a spoon falls, a baby calls."

05:03.261 --> 05:04.721
Probably Lady Blackwood's.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.598
Kindly spare me
your old wives' tales, Sister.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.101
Lady Blackwood's barely started
her fourth trimester. It'll be ages yet.

05:12.144 --> 05:13.771
Where's Sabrina? Ambrose?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.189
In her room, I believe.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.274
Still?

05:16.649 --> 05:17.901
It's been days.

05:17.983 --> 05:19.944
Yeah, but considering
what she's been through...

05:20.028 --> 05:22.197
I know exactly
what she's been through, Ambrose.

05:22.279 --> 05:24.324
I was there to pick up the pieces,
wasn't I?

05:26.201 --> 05:28.829
She has school.
People will start to talk.

05:28.911 --> 05:33.332
Well, I've made her a little balm
for her broken heart.

05:33.415 --> 05:35.543
- I'm gonna take it up to her.
- No, I will.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.298
You can't stay in bed for the rest
of your life. You have school.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.716
What if I see him, or he sees me?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.343
It'll be too much.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
Your Aunt Hilda's made you a balm.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.682
To numb your heart.

05:48.764 --> 05:52.143
Rub it in your chest three times daily,
or as needed.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.646
I don't want to stop feeling.
I want to stop hurting.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.610
No, that's wrong.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.196
I want Harvey to stop hurting.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.615
There's no balm for that.
If there were, we'd be as rich as Midas.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.826
What am I gonna do, Aunt Zee?

06:11.036 --> 06:13.581
Today, you'll go to school,

06:13.665 --> 06:16.209
and you'll talk to your friends,

06:16.668 --> 06:19.879
and you'll sit in class
and answer questions.

06:21.088 --> 06:23.966
And then you'll go to the Academy.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.261
Then you'll come home...

06:26.802 --> 06:28.762
and we'll eat supper together.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.973
And then you'll go to bed.

06:31.766 --> 06:36.103
And your Aunt Hilda or I will sit
by your side until you fall asleep.

06:37.187 --> 06:38.187
And tomorrow...

06:39.231 --> 06:42.485
you'll do the same,
and it will hurt a tiny bit less.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.988
And the next day, it will hurt even less.

06:46.363 --> 06:48.449
After what I put Harvey through...

06:50.201 --> 06:52.077
how can I ever face him again?

06:52.536 --> 06:53.536
You...

06:56.707 --> 06:58.000
I'm not sure.

06:59.793 --> 07:01.379
I've never been where you are.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.600
Perhaps you just do, Sabrina.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.937
As bravely and as humbly as you can.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.343
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.012
Roz. Susie.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.805
What's going on?

07:53.305 --> 07:54.766
What's going on with you?

07:54.848 --> 07:57.143
Yeah, you look
a little freaked out, Sabrina.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.812
I called you all weekend.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.105
Me, too.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.149
I wasn't, uh, feeling that great.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.781
'Brina, we want...

08:10.781 --> 08:12.422
- We need to ask you...
- Are you a witch?

08:23.043 --> 08:24.043
What?

08:25.463 --> 08:28.925
You guys, if this is some kind of joke?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.259
It's not a joke.

08:31.468 --> 08:33.096
The cunning showed me something.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.181
A vision.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.726
And... my Aunt Dorothea...

08:40.186 --> 08:41.855
wrote about you in her journals.

08:41.937 --> 08:44.356
She said the Spellmans were
a family of witches.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.109
That's just...

08:48.360 --> 08:49.446
That's just...

08:49.738 --> 08:50.864
'Brina?

08:52.657 --> 08:57.495
I wanted to tell youÂ so many times, but...

08:58.788 --> 09:00.206
but how could I?

09:00.749 --> 09:04.085
- And now Harvey knows. Everything is...
- Harvey knows?

09:04.168 --> 09:05.211
It's over.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.548
- He broke up with me.
- What? Why?

09:08.630 --> 09:11.051
Because of everything.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.509
All the lying.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.597
I've been hiding this whole other life,
going to this different school.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.599
What do you mean?

09:17.682 --> 09:21.602
For witches.
But I'm still the same person.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.773
Even after what happened with Tommy.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.774
- Sabrina?
- I did it.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.693
I resurrected Tommy.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.863
I wanted to help.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.283
But then he came back all wrong, and...

09:35.741 --> 09:38.787
it's all my fault, and Harvey...

09:39.412 --> 09:41.748
Harvey had to kill him.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.831
- Oh, my.
- Oh.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.000
Sabrina...

09:46.126 --> 09:49.129
I mean, he'll never forgive me.
I mean, how could he?

09:49.213 --> 09:50.590
I'm so sorry.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.552
I never wanted to lie to you or hurt you.
Any of you.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.721
- That's all I've been doing.
- That's okay.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.264
It's okay.

10:00.682 --> 10:03.769
- We're here for you, Sabrina.
- We will always be here for you.

10:03.852 --> 10:06.730
Thank you, guys. You're the best.

10:07.731 --> 10:11.360
<i>I can't tell you
how disappointed I was to hear</i>

10:11.735 --> 10:15.240
Sabrina's mortal friends rally around her.

10:15.322 --> 10:17.491
Despite my every manipulation,

10:17.575 --> 10:20.495
despite everything they'd learned
about Sabrina,

10:20.577 --> 10:23.331
her friends would not be cleaved from her.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.085
The Dark Lord was growing
impatient with me.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.671
I needed to change tactics.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.798
Introduce a threat to Greendale

10:32.881 --> 10:36.510
that would compel Sabrina
to make certain choices

10:36.594 --> 10:38.011
that would, in turn...

10:40.722 --> 10:42.975
...force her to separate from them.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.894
As for the threat, I...

10:46.145 --> 10:47.730
had an idea or two...

10:49.941 --> 10:51.650
or thirteen...

10:53.278 --> 10:56.905
...buried right under our noses.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.537
<i>But I would have to wait
until midnight, the witching hour.</i>

11:03.580 --> 11:05.664
<i>And I would need a warm body.</i>

11:06.499 --> 11:07.792
<i>There you go.</i>

11:17.467 --> 11:19.095
Sabrina?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.014
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

11:21.096 --> 11:23.099
for how everything went down
with the resurrection.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.183
How did you hear?

11:24.683 --> 11:26.059
Bad news travels fast.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.854
It's all anybody's talking about.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.063
Your failed resurrection.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.691
Thoughts and prayers.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.110
Isn't that how the mortals put it?

11:38.990 --> 11:40.325
How is the mortal?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.453
His name is Harvey, and he is devastated.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.788
We broke up.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.042
You really love him, don't you?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.794
That's the one thing I envy about mortals.

11:53.962 --> 11:56.006
The way they can give themselves
to each other.

11:57.008 --> 12:00.260
Witches are aces
at passion and lust, but...

12:01.011 --> 12:02.221
when it comes to love...

12:03.514 --> 12:04.514
true love...

12:06.643 --> 12:07.851
not so much.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.354
Why is that?

12:10.520 --> 12:12.606
Our Dark Lord is a jealous lord.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.485
He wants us to love him and only him.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.028
Selfish, isn't it?

12:17.861 --> 12:20.155
Yeah, but it would be easier in some ways.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.240
Nah.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.743
I'd trade all the witch-orgies
in the world

12:23.826 --> 12:25.370
for what you and the mortal have.

12:25.452 --> 12:26.495
Had.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.081
You'll pull through this, Sabrina.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.626
And if you need a shoulder to cry on...

12:38.508 --> 12:39.716
That can't be good.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.192
Steve. Stevie, slow down.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.528
Hey, you asked me out, remember?
You suggested we come out to the woods.

12:59.611 --> 13:01.239
That's true.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.283
So stop playing hard to get.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.201
Why are you virgins always so aggressive?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.539
- What? I'm not a...
- Oh, Mr. Loomis.

13:10.914 --> 13:15.211
I smell virgins
the way a rabid dog smells blood.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.048
But don't be embarrassed.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.884
A virgin suits my needs tonight.

13:23.510 --> 13:26.014
I call out to the Greendale Thirteen!

13:26.389 --> 13:29.267
To the witches hunted by mortals!

13:30.143 --> 13:32.519
Betrayed by their own kind.

13:32.602 --> 13:35.148
Hung from this tree by their necks.

13:35.230 --> 13:38.567
Arise, Sisters. Arise.

13:49.202 --> 13:50.705
Welcome back, ladies.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.207
Where are we?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.751
Greendale.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.422
And the witching hour is upon us.

14:00.756 --> 14:06.846
Tonight and tomorrow,
for one hour, from midnight to one,

14:08.472 --> 14:11.100
you may walk the earth again...

14:12.059 --> 14:13.936
to claim your revenge.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.855
Go forth, Sisters.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.192
Take to the sleeping streets.

14:21.068 --> 14:25.322
Reacquaint yourself
with the town you so despise.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.659
And then summon the butcher...

14:30.577 --> 14:33.663
who will end Greendale, once...

14:34.790 --> 14:36.084
and for all.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.772
- Out of my way.
- Madame...

14:57.855 --> 14:58.940
Thank you.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.775
Hilda?

15:03.193 --> 15:04.403
Do you feel that?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.366
It's like a train going past a graveyard.

15:32.889 --> 15:33.890
Who's there?

15:37.644 --> 15:38.770
Show yourself.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.192
I said, show yourself!

16:00.710 --> 16:02.128
<i>Wake up, Susie.</i>

16:14.347 --> 16:15.515
What the hell?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.309
They've come back.

16:19.352 --> 16:20.812
Who has, Aunt Dorothea?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.442
The thirteen women,
hung to death as witches.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.611
Women I brought to the New World
to live freely.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.657
The same women I buried here on our land.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.158
On our farm?

16:33.826 --> 16:37.330
No one else would cut them down
from the hanging tree in the woods.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.456
They deserved a place to rest.

16:40.415 --> 16:41.625
Why are they back?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.419
They were hunted and betrayed.

16:45.086 --> 16:47.631
They should've been buried
by their own kind.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.634
Among their own kind.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.927
Wrathful.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.596
They come for vengeance.

16:54.679 --> 16:56.139
Is there any way to stop them?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.625
We don't have to tramp
out into the woodsÂ after midnight

17:08.653 --> 17:11.489
- just to get kinky.
- Ssh! That's not what this is.

17:11.570 --> 17:14.366
I just want to show youÂ my favorite spot.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.787
I already know your favorite spot,
and it's right between your...

17:17.868 --> 17:20.454
Favorite spot for moon-gazing, you ass.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.209
Ambrose, what?

17:23.875 --> 17:25.752
- What's going on?
- Don't you hear that?

17:31.884 --> 17:32.926
What is that?

17:34.427 --> 17:35.721
Over there. Look.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.144
It's a circle of witches.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.646
From our coven?

17:44.730 --> 17:45.981
Gathering for what?

17:47.357 --> 17:48.357
Sounds like...

17:50.403 --> 17:51.403
a summoning spell.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.240
They're calling forth something.
Ambrose, we should go.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.866
Why? If they're witches,
they're our people.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.045
They're probably out here
having a good time.

18:00.328 --> 18:01.872
And what if they're not?

18:42.829 --> 18:44.123
Warlock...

18:46.666 --> 18:49.878
Take this warning to your masters
at the Church of Night.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.968
It's okay, I promise.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.805
<i>Tommy, stop it! Tommy!</i>

19:20.241 --> 19:21.241
Hi.

19:24.954 --> 19:25.954
Hi.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.625
How are you, Harvey?

19:29.042 --> 19:30.461
Better than my dad.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.712
What did you tell him?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.464
That Tommy did it.

19:35.715 --> 19:37.509
To put himself out of his misery.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.637
He just nodded and said,
"He was my Tommy."

19:41.846 --> 19:46.644
Then we called the funeral home,
but not you guys, the one in Riverdale.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.813
That makes sense.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
Yeah.

19:50.730 --> 19:53.317
I've been thinking about you nonstop,
Harvey.

19:53.776 --> 19:58.739
I've wanted to call you so badly,
but I just thought that I shouldn't...

19:58.823 --> 20:00.324
You know, it's funny...

20:01.909 --> 20:03.326
knowing now that you're a...

20:04.244 --> 20:07.205
a witch makes a lot of sense somehow.

20:07.288 --> 20:09.709
There's so many things
I never understood before.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.751
About you...

20:13.378 --> 20:14.378
about us.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.133
I thought maybe
I was just too stupid to understand.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.215
No.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.011
Harvey, it kills me
that you ever felt that way.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.182
I just couldn't tell you before.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.351
I should've trusted you.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.144
I know that now.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.273
You must really hate me.

20:34.607 --> 20:36.192
I could never hate you.

20:36.861 --> 20:37.861
Remember...

20:39.195 --> 20:41.073
I promised you that on your birthday.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.540
But every time I look at you,
all I can think about is my brother.

20:56.212 --> 20:58.965
Hi. So sorry to interrupt.

20:59.048 --> 21:02.135
Harvey, I'm so sorry
about your poor brother.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.513
- Uh, thanks, Miss Spellman.
- What's going on, Aunt Hilda?

21:05.597 --> 21:09.684
So, you need to come
to the Church of Night straight away.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.188
Father Blackwood has called
an emergency meeting.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.105
During the day?

21:13.189 --> 21:16.901
Hm-mm. Bit of a crisis,
so if you could meet me there.

21:16.983 --> 21:18.193
So sorry.

21:27.076 --> 21:29.622
Your aunt, she wasn't really here,
was she?

21:29.913 --> 21:34.000
No, she was... astral-projecting.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.795
And the Church of Night?

21:36.586 --> 21:37.671
Is our coven.

21:37.755 --> 21:38.756
Right.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.009
Well, it sounds like
you'd better get going.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.346
- Harvey...
- I mean, you have to.

21:46.971 --> 21:48.097
It's your coven.

21:51.684 --> 21:52.684
Yeah.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.903
But I hope we can talk some more.

22:02.863 --> 22:03.905
When you're ready.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.163
<i>Brothers and Sisters...</i>

22:11.955 --> 22:14.165
last night I witnessed an omen.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.751
As so many of you did.

22:17.126 --> 22:20.631
A horrifying sign
that can portend only one thing.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.634
The Fires of the Abyss
are being made ready.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.263
The Pit is yawning beneath us.

22:29.056 --> 22:33.935
The Dark Lord has seen
our contemptible weakness.

22:34.979 --> 22:39.441
Our blatant disregard
for witch law and doctrine.

22:40.483 --> 22:43.820
And Satan,
vengeful God that he is, plans...

22:43.903 --> 22:45.154
...to punish us!

22:45.698 --> 22:46.699
Father Blackwood!

22:48.200 --> 22:50.869
It is not the Dark Lord's wrath
that has come for us,

22:50.952 --> 22:53.705
it is... the Greendale Thirteen.

22:53.788 --> 22:55.749
We stumbled upon them
in the woods last night.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.251
They were performing some kind of ritual.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.795
A summoning spell.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.213
They bore into our minds. Bewitched us.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.217
We're only alive because they wanted
us to deliver a message.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.553
What message? Spit it out.

23:07.635 --> 23:10.221
They've returned to visit Death
upon the town of Greendale.

23:10.638 --> 23:14.058
Last night, they rose to call forth
their Crimson Avenger.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.438
Tonight, on the witching hour, he rides!

23:17.520 --> 23:20.607
Who rides, Ambrose?
What are you talking about?

23:22.692 --> 23:24.862
The Red Angel of Death, Auntie.

23:24.944 --> 23:28.699
The Thirteen will knock down
all the doors in town for him,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.200
and in his wake,

23:31.201 --> 23:35.830
the firstborn of Greendale,
both mortal and witch alike, will perish!

23:39.250 --> 23:41.211
Silence! Silence!

23:43.797 --> 23:45.924
You've done well to bring this to us,
Brother Ambrose,

23:46.008 --> 23:50.429
but if it is the wrath of the Thirteen and
their messenger of Crimson Death we face,

23:50.804 --> 23:56.143
I, your High Priest, will protect you.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.440
With all due respect, Your Excellency,
and acknowledging

24:01.522 --> 24:04.276
that I'm excommunicated, protect us how?

24:05.068 --> 24:08.154
The coven will gather
within the walls of the Academy.

24:08.238 --> 24:12.492
Fortified, bound
by our combinedÂ impenetrable magics,

24:12.576 --> 24:15.203
we will stand together,

24:15.287 --> 24:19.625
until the blood-red horseman
has passed through Greendale!

24:25.047 --> 24:26.589
But what about the mortals?

24:27.633 --> 24:29.259
The people of Greendale.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.722
Let them run to their False God
and gnash their teeth and wail,

24:34.807 --> 24:35.846
or whatever it is they do.

24:36.432 --> 24:40.061
Brethren, be inside the Academy
by midnight...

24:40.561 --> 24:42.271
or face the Thirteen...

24:43.272 --> 24:45.817
and their avenging angel alone.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.444
<i>I don't understand.</i>

24:48.528 --> 24:51.240
Why would the Greendale Thirteen
be angryÂ at us?

24:51.323 --> 24:54.242
It's a bloody mess
what happened to the Greendale Thirteen.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.925
The most ignoble chapter
of the Church of Night's history,

24:56.953 --> 24:59.873
but it is our history,
and we cannot deny it.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.334
After the witch trials of Salem,
all the witches

25:02.417 --> 25:04.097
in this part of the country
were terrified.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.505
Trouble was brewing in Greendale,

25:06.587 --> 25:09.967
and people... mortals were identifying
and arresting witches,

25:10.049 --> 25:12.094
including the original Thirteen.

25:12.928 --> 25:17.807
And while they sat in their cell,
the other witches met and decided...

25:17.891 --> 25:19.893
The Thirteen would be sacrificed.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.980
To appease the mortals' blood-lust.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.067
While those thirteen women were tortured
and hung,

25:28.152 --> 25:29.486
the rest of the witches...

25:30.820 --> 25:33.323
burned their poppets
and buried their cauldrons.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.410
They were scapegoats
to quell the rising witch hysteria.

25:36.492 --> 25:39.579
The coven could have come together
to save the Thirteen, but they...

25:40.663 --> 25:43.375
We, our ancestors...

25:44.835 --> 25:46.545
decided not to risk it.

25:47.712 --> 25:51.424
So we're all descendants of the witches
who turned their backs on the Thirteen

25:51.508 --> 25:54.552
and let them die? No wonder they hate us.

25:54.635 --> 25:58.347
And the mortals that did the actual
hunting and hanging,Â to be fair.

25:58.432 --> 26:01.101
Well, you'd better believe
that I am not abandoning my friends

26:01.184 --> 26:03.686
to go hide
in some magical doomsday bunker.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.690
And before you even try
to stop me, Auntie Zee...

26:06.773 --> 26:10.068
On the contrary, I think we should
all stay and protect the town.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.653
- Really?
- I didn't expect that.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.990
And why not?
The Greendale Thirteen were sacrificed

26:15.074 --> 26:17.534
so that the pack might survive.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.204
But we need not make
the same mistake again.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.414
We are Spellmans.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.000
That means we stand tall, with dignity,

26:26.085 --> 26:28.045
and we do what is right.

26:28.836 --> 26:30.838
As your father always did, Sabrina.

26:31.298 --> 26:35.384
The mortals may be weak,
but they do not deserve this grim fate.

26:35.802 --> 26:40.432
Doom has been unleashed by witches.
It must be averted by witches.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.934
All right, but protect them how?

26:43.268 --> 26:46.438
We can hardly be all places at once.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.147
We can't protect the whole town.

26:48.231 --> 26:51.359
We can if we do the same
as Father Blackwood is doing.

26:51.442 --> 26:53.153
We gather the mortals together.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.905
Zelda, I think I might have the answer.

26:56.365 --> 27:00.285
Dr. Cerberus told me something.
He used to be the local weatherman.

27:00.368 --> 27:02.287
- Oh, for Satan's sake!
- Um...

27:02.371 --> 27:05.540
He said that in the event of a tornado
or severe weather,

27:05.624 --> 27:09.586
that the town's designated shelter was
Baxter High basement.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.672
That's a great idea, Aunt Hilda.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.798
All we need is a tornado.

27:14.465 --> 27:16.634
That's easy enough.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.648
Boreas, North Wind, I summon you.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.819
Euros, East Wind, I summon you.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.030
Notos, South Wind, I summon you.

27:38.115 --> 27:41.993
Zephuros, West Wind, I summon you.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.628
Is it working? How will we know?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.381
Give it a moment.

28:23.492 --> 28:25.871
Pray to Satan the mortals
heed the warning.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.915
And for the most part, they did.

28:29.415 --> 28:31.500
<i>The mortals of Greendale gathered</i>

28:31.585 --> 28:34.212
<i>to take refuge
in the bowels of Baxter High.</i>

28:37.423 --> 28:41.260
All right. All right.
Easy does it. Nice and slow.

28:41.552 --> 28:45.307
That's it. There's plenty of room
for all in the storm shelter.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.059
Don't you find this invigorating,
Ms. Wardwell?

28:48.559 --> 28:51.730
I've always been fascinated
by tornadoes myself,

28:51.813 --> 28:53.565
ever since <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

28:54.816 --> 28:55.942
And now, here we are.

28:56.026 --> 28:59.195
Our school, the only safe place
in Greendale.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.490
I'm engorged with excitement.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.615
Mr. Hawthorne...

29:02.699 --> 29:06.662
Perhaps, when all this is over,
you and I might finally have that drink?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.462
Father Blackwood?

29:17.588 --> 29:19.590
- All are accounted for.
- Splendid.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.300
With our collective energies,

29:21.384 --> 29:23.470
we shall prevent the witches
or their Red Angel

29:23.553 --> 29:25.137
from crossing our threshold.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.682
All save the Spellmans.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.517
None of them are here.

29:29.308 --> 29:30.477
Not even Ambrose.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.105
Pity.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.941
I had hopes for that boy.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.357
Never mind.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.487
He made his choice.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.210
Susie, have you seen Harvey?

29:55.294 --> 29:58.380
No, and I saw Roz's dad,
but I don't think Roz is here, Sabrina.

29:58.462 --> 30:00.173
- I'll go to Harvey's.
- I'll go to Roz's.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.218
But, Susie, you have to be back
before midnight.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.140
Why aren't you at school?
Didn't you hear the siren?

30:08.222 --> 30:11.809
I did, but we've got a storm cellar,
and my dad's in no shape to travel,

30:11.893 --> 30:13.772
- so we're gonna stay here.
- Harvey, you can't.

30:13.854 --> 30:18.232
It's not a tornado that's coming,
it's something much, much worse.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.152
You must mean witches.

30:20.234 --> 30:22.988
Yes, and then something called
the Red Angel of Death.

30:23.070 --> 30:24.740
- But we can protect you.
- You?

30:25.781 --> 30:28.160
Witches will protect me
and my dad from other witches?

30:30.287 --> 30:33.664
That's okay. I appreciate the offer,
but I'll protect myself.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.209
I'll protect my dad,
and I'll protect this house.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.853
- Harvey, now is not the time...
- It's what Tommy would've done.

30:39.378 --> 30:42.618
You've gotta understand why I don't want
to rely on witches for my protection now.

30:42.673 --> 30:45.259
- No, I know...
- Please don't fight me on this, 'Brina.

30:46.927 --> 30:48.637
I said, I'm staying.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.223
I'm done being a coward.

31:00.317 --> 31:05.071
My Nana Ruth doesn't want to go,
and I can't leave her alone.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.950
But everyone's at the school, Roz.
There's a tornado coming.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.368
Child, please.

31:10.826 --> 31:12.412
We're Walker women.

31:12.788 --> 31:13.954
We're cunning women.

31:14.038 --> 31:17.666
We know what's coming,
and it ain't a tornado.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.087
It's witches, Susie.

31:21.797 --> 31:25.592
And... a man dressed in red
on a white horse.

31:25.674 --> 31:28.237
Even more reason for you to be
at Baxter High with the rest of us.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.679
Listen here, young man.

31:30.262 --> 31:33.974
I have spent the better part of 30 years
sitting in this chair.

31:34.351 --> 31:37.019
I don't see any reason to leave now.

31:37.813 --> 31:38.813
Roz?

31:41.273 --> 31:42.526
I'm sorry, Susie.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.572
Then I'm staying, too.

31:47.780 --> 31:48.615
Susie.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.241
I'm staying, Roz.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.201
It's what Dorothea would do.

31:52.993 --> 31:54.996
It's what she would want me to do.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.372
I know it.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.128
Sabrina, where have you been?

32:02.211 --> 32:05.048
The mortals are down in the shelter,
and it's almost the witching hour.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.718
I went to Harvey's, and then I had
to make a detour to call in a favor.

32:08.801 --> 32:09.928
A favor? Of whom?

32:13.222 --> 32:14.598
Hey. Harvey, right?

32:15.016 --> 32:16.643
- Yeah. Who are you?
- I'm Nick Scratch.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.520
Sabrina sent me. I'm a friend of hers
and your back-up for the night.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.666
So I'll need you to show me every window
and door in this house,

32:22.731 --> 32:24.567
so I can seal and bind them for you.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.364
What kind of friend?

32:55.932 --> 32:58.184
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>

32:58.268 --> 33:02.439
<i>mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:02.521 --> 33:06.942
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:07.402 --> 33:09.570
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>

33:09.653 --> 33:12.907
<i>mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:12.990 --> 33:15.743
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:15.826 --> 33:17.953
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>

33:18.038 --> 33:20.664
<i>mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:20.749 --> 33:23.585
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:23.667 --> 33:26.587
<i>Qui affecto protego,
mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:26.671 --> 33:28.006
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:28.088 --> 33:31.134
<i>Qui affecto protego,
mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:31.218 --> 33:32.426
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:32.510 --> 33:34.887
- You gonna do something here?
- I'm doing it, farm boy.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.282
Not that you deserve it.
You're a witch hunter, aren't you?

33:37.307 --> 33:38.349
She still loves you.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.810
<i>Qui affecto protego,
mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

33:41.894 --> 33:43.730
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

33:46.816 --> 33:47.858
Susie...

33:48.943 --> 33:49.943
did you see that?

34:05.835 --> 34:07.211
My name is Susie Putnam.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.675
Blood of Dorothea Putnam,

34:11.757 --> 34:14.260
who gave you passage across
the ocean when no one else would,

34:14.344 --> 34:17.639
who cut you down from the hanging tree
when no one else would.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.849
The Walkers are my friends.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.893
Please don't hurt them.

34:35.197 --> 34:38.242
It's working, isn't it?
The protection spell, Aunt Zelda?

34:38.326 --> 34:41.246
Yes, as long as we four
remain focused, it just might.

34:46.041 --> 34:48.210
Faustus, you brought me here?

34:48.295 --> 34:50.855
- I did, Sister Zelda...
- I have to go back. My family needs me.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.922
Your sworn duty is here, Zelda!

34:53.007 --> 34:54.884
Lady Blackwood has gone into labor.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.847
Damn you, Faustus.

35:00.639 --> 35:03.351
I'll need clean towels, fresh water,
and Prudence.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.313
- Prudence?
- Yes, I'll need help,

35:06.396 --> 35:08.188
and this is no place for a man.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.733
And that very much includes you.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.030
Yes.

35:17.364 --> 35:18.824
You'll be just fine.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.621
Where did Aunt Zelda go?
What is happening?

35:23.704 --> 35:25.873
Can the protection spell hold
with just three of us?

35:25.956 --> 35:30.128
It's a bit dodgy, but if three of us just
pick up the slack and no one else disap...

35:30.628 --> 35:31.628
No!

35:33.547 --> 35:34.840
Luke, what am I doing here?

35:34.923 --> 35:37.217
I teleported you here.
It's no use trying to leave.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.342
I've bound you to the Academy,
and you have to stay.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.067
- Why? Why would you do this?
- Because you belong here with us now,

35:42.097 --> 35:44.141
with your own kind,
safe inside these walls,

35:44.224 --> 35:46.268
standing with the coven
with your warlock brothers.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.228
With me, Ambrose.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.565
- No. You don't understand. I have to...
- No, <i>you </i> don't understand!

35:50.648 --> 35:53.025
I couldn't leave you out there
to die, Ambrose.

35:53.525 --> 35:54.985
Because I love you.

36:04.411 --> 36:06.914
The witches are getting stronger
out there, I can sense it.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.458
Ms. Wardwell,
it's just me and Aunt Hilda now.

36:09.833 --> 36:12.253
I'm fading, love.
I don't think I can hold out much longer.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.547
Sabrina, if youÂ and your Aunt
can't maintain the spell,

36:15.632 --> 36:18.300
the Thirteen will throw open
every door and window.

36:18.385 --> 36:21.554
The mortals will be unprotected
when the Red Angel arrives,

36:21.637 --> 36:23.514
and there will be no escaping his sword.

36:23.597 --> 36:24.766
Pitch in at any time.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.811
I fear we would still falter
before the witching hour ends.

36:27.893 --> 36:32.148
Then there's the matter of Mr. Kinkle,
Miss Putnam, Miss Walker.

36:32.231 --> 36:35.943
They're out there,
facing their own personal assaults.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.655
No, the time for defense is over.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.907
It's time to go on the offensive.

36:40.989 --> 36:42.534
How would we even do that?

36:42.617 --> 36:46.079
As a matter of fact, I have an idea,
but it would mean your Aunt Hilda here

36:46.161 --> 36:47.914
holding down the fort alone for a bit.

36:47.996 --> 36:50.583
- Alone? Bloody hell!
- Sabrina, we are running out of time.

36:50.666 --> 36:54.963
Fine, let's do it. Aunt Hilda, hold on.
Salem, stay here and watch Aunt Hilda.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.632
Just do it, Salem!
I'll be back as soon as I can.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.307
<i>In the end,
there was only one way to accomplish</i>

37:07.391 --> 37:09.728
<i>what the Dark Lord wanted.</i>

37:10.561 --> 37:13.398
Make it so that Sabrina would have
no other option.

37:14.940 --> 37:19.027
There would only be one path
to save the mortals.

37:22.197 --> 37:24.451
The Path of Night.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.871
<i>And so we went
back to the clearing in the woods,</i>

37:29.706 --> 37:34.251
<i>where this story first began
16 years ago.</i>

37:34.543 --> 37:35.753
Wait...

37:35.836 --> 37:38.547
Ms. Wardwell,
this is where my Dark Baptism...

37:38.630 --> 37:40.800
...almost but not quite took place.

37:43.677 --> 37:44.721
Ms. Wardwell...

37:45.429 --> 37:47.724
what is the <i>Book of the Beast </i> doing here?

37:49.559 --> 37:50.684
The kind of...

37:51.561 --> 37:54.188
power you'll need
to save Greendale will...

37:54.938 --> 37:56.023
require you to...

37:56.106 --> 37:57.525
Sign my name?

37:58.777 --> 38:01.570
Exchange my freedom for power?

38:03.447 --> 38:06.701
I already said no to this, Ms. Wardwell.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.913
This is what your father
and mother wanted for you.

38:10.496 --> 38:13.041
That wasn't a lie your aunties told you.

38:13.333 --> 38:16.085
The circumstances, you must agree,
have changed.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.630
You're not the same girl,

38:18.713 --> 38:21.673
not the same witch you were
the night of the...

38:22.550 --> 38:24.302
ill-fated baptism.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.346
You have the potential

38:26.846 --> 38:29.807
to be the greatest witch
of your generation.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.894
There is a cost that comes with that.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.438
There has to be another way.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.817
There's not one I can think of.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.152
You must sign.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.572
It's the only way you'll ever
be strong enough to stop...

38:51.746 --> 38:53.039
That's him now.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.668
The Red Angel of Death.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.710
Can you hear him?

39:19.690 --> 39:21.233
I know you're scared, Sabrina.

39:21.733 --> 39:24.945
Because all women are taught
to fear power.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.657
Own your power.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.411
Don't accept it from the Dark Lord.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.371
Take it. Wield it.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.664
Save your friends.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.000
Ms. Wardwell...

39:37.333 --> 39:39.376
You've all but signed already.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.460
But...

39:41.461 --> 39:42.838
What's more important?

39:43.338 --> 39:48.635
That pissing contest with the Dark Lord,
or the salvation of your friends?

39:49.469 --> 39:51.931
If I sign...

39:52.639 --> 39:54.391
It is your destiny.

39:56.059 --> 39:59.271
If you do not, Harvey will die.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.525
Rosalind and Susie will die.

40:03.025 --> 40:05.945
Your aunts and your cousin will die.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.237
I will die.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.364
Please, Sabrina...

40:11.242 --> 40:12.911
for all our sakes.

40:18.916 --> 40:19.916
I'll sign.

40:31.554 --> 40:36.016
Do you do this of your own free will?

40:37.518 --> 40:42.606
And do you understand what it means?

40:44.317 --> 40:49.697
When I call on you, girl, you must answer.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.226
<i>I shall deliver Sabrina unto you.</i>

41:18.309 --> 41:19.726
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

41:19.811 --> 41:23.188
<i>Oh, my child, you have
no idea how special you are, do you?</i>

41:25.148 --> 41:27.068
<i>There's no flying in my life...</i>

41:28.360 --> 41:29.360
<i>without you.</i>

41:34.242 --> 41:36.452
<i>You must sign the </i> Book of the Beast!

41:36.536 --> 41:37.577
<i>I can't do this.</i>

41:37.661 --> 41:40.998
<i>Sabrina Spellman
shall retain her mortal life,</i>

41:41.081 --> 41:45.753
<i>on the condition that she also attend
the Academy of Unseen Arts.</i>

41:49.507 --> 41:52.010
<i>- Are you ready to meet your fate?
- Prudence, please.</i>

41:52.092 --> 41:54.594
<i>I'm begging you, leave me alone.</i>

41:54.679 --> 41:57.014
<i>There's not a hope
in hell of that, half-breed.</i>

41:57.472 --> 42:00.684
<i>How am I ever going to outwit
the Dark Lord?</i>

42:00.768 --> 42:03.271
<i>Your parents died because of you.</i>

42:07.733 --> 42:09.568
<i>How's that feel?</i>

42:10.402 --> 42:12.155
<i>Not to have faith in anything?</i>

42:15.365 --> 42:16.367
<i>Mom, it's me.</i>

42:16.992 --> 42:19.786
<i>They took my baby after the baptism.</i>

42:19.871 --> 42:22.081
<i>They told me she had died.</i>

42:23.248 --> 42:25.376
<i>It's better to forget the mortal world.</i>

42:26.168 --> 42:28.963
<i>Harvey, please. Let me stay.
Let me at least help...</i>

42:29.088 --> 42:30.297
<i>No, Sabrina. You've...</i>

42:30.380 --> 42:31.507
You've done enough.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.510
You have to go.

42:35.969 --> 42:39.389
<i>Everything has a price.</i>

42:40.516 --> 42:42.726
<i>Edward learned that lesson.</i>

42:43.186 --> 42:44.436
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

42:54.237 --> 42:56.740
Sabrina. Breathe. Let it in.

42:57.784 --> 43:00.494
- Can you feel it? Do you feel it.
- Yes.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.998
- We don't have much time.
- Where...

43:05.123 --> 43:06.125
Where do we go now?

43:07.460 --> 43:09.336
What do we do to stop the Thirteen...

43:09.795 --> 43:10.795
and the Red Angel?

43:12.507 --> 43:14.634
Not we, you.

43:15.550 --> 43:18.721
The power is yours, not ours.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.222
Where do I go?

43:21.891 --> 43:24.351
- What do I do?
- Don't you know, Sabrina?

43:25.936 --> 43:29.481
Hasn't the Dark Lord already shown you
what to do?

43:29.565 --> 43:30.565
What are you...?

43:31.483 --> 43:32.483
I don't...

43:43.121 --> 43:44.789
I was at the Hanging Tree.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.878
Where the witches died.

43:55.590 --> 43:57.260
It was on fire.

44:03.056 --> 44:06.476
We're nearly there, Lady Blackwood.
One more push.

44:07.644 --> 44:10.313
And here comes your first...

44:14.277 --> 44:15.570
What is it?

44:15.652 --> 44:18.447
Nothing. You're doing fine,
Lady Blackwood.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.574
Just think ofÂ how proud
the High Priest will be.

44:20.657 --> 44:22.201
Is he all right, my son?

44:22.284 --> 44:24.786
Strong and fine, Lady Blackwood.

44:24.871 --> 44:28.206
Sister Spellman,
Lady Blackwood's bleeding too much.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.708
We'll fix her right up.

44:30.293 --> 44:33.128
My babies... Sister Zelda, my babies.

44:33.628 --> 44:35.590
They must be preserved...

44:37.382 --> 44:38.800
...at all costs.

44:50.980 --> 44:52.356
Hilda, there you are.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.690
Dr. Cee?

44:54.650 --> 44:55.818
What are you doing?

44:55.902 --> 44:58.445
You should be downstairs.
I got so worried.

44:58.528 --> 45:02.282
I'm saying a little prayer
against the tornado.

45:02.365 --> 45:03.951
Do you need me to stay?

45:05.661 --> 45:09.081
Just hold my hands. Just for a minute.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.043
Will that help?

45:12.835 --> 45:14.128
It can't hurt, can it?

45:24.012 --> 45:27.141
Susie, what happened? What did you do?

45:27.224 --> 45:31.603
I have no clue.
Maybe she just got tired and went home?

45:32.188 --> 45:33.438
No, children.

45:34.315 --> 45:35.398
She left.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.568
She left...

45:38.902 --> 45:41.822
because it's his turn now.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.574
The Crimson Rider.

45:45.284 --> 45:47.452
The Angel of Death.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.539
Can't you hear him?

45:53.668 --> 45:55.335
That horse of his?

46:09.809 --> 46:12.728
- What the hell is that now?
- That, mortal, is the main event.

46:13.186 --> 46:14.563
The Doom of Greendale.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.612
You're not your father's
firstborn son, are you?

46:20.318 --> 46:21.945
No, that would have been Tommy.

46:22.445 --> 46:23.655
What about your father?

46:24.739 --> 46:26.951
He's the firstborn son, yeah.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.420
How do I do it, Ms. Wardwell?

46:38.295 --> 46:39.297
Dig deep.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.465
It isn't just power, Sabrina.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.842
It's rage.

46:44.927 --> 46:47.429
It's the desire to change the world...

46:48.264 --> 46:49.681
and the will to do it.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.559
Command the Greendale Thirteen.

46:58.356 --> 47:01.818
I order the Greendale Thirteen to stop!

47:04.112 --> 47:07.199
Go in peace, or face my wrath!

47:18.251 --> 47:20.463
Is that it? Has the storm passed?

47:23.090 --> 47:25.342
No, it just got here.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.431
Tell me. You're not the firstborn
in your family, are you?

47:30.972 --> 47:32.557
Oldest of three boys.

47:34.768 --> 47:37.563
Hear me, hear me. Run away.
Live to see another day.

47:38.188 --> 47:41.192
Run! Go! I will be right behind you.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.077
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>

47:52.161 --> 47:55.039
<i>mixtisque iubas serpentibus.</i>

47:57.833 --> 48:01.753
<i>Qui affecto protego,
mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>

48:01.836 --> 48:04.340
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>

48:05.465 --> 48:07.092
<i>Qui affecto protego.</i>

48:11.054 --> 48:13.099
Who are you to order us?

48:13.306 --> 48:16.268
We felt the wrath of Greendale once,
child.

48:16.643 --> 48:19.480
- We won't be hung again.
- No, not hung.

48:20.563 --> 48:21.731
Burned.

48:22.108 --> 48:23.900
Burn us, half-witch?

48:24.610 --> 48:26.237
We are not of this Earth.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.697
No earthly fire can burn us.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.699
No, not earthly fire.

48:31.742 --> 48:32.576
Hellfire.

48:32.659 --> 48:37.623
None but the most powerful
can summon it: Devils.

48:37.831 --> 48:40.501
And in the history of witches,
only three...

48:40.583 --> 48:42.585
Well, it's about to be four.

48:42.961 --> 48:47.842
I, Sabrina Spellman,
daughter of Edward Spellman,

48:47.925 --> 48:53.472
Child of Night, call forth...
Fire from the Pit.

48:56.141 --> 48:59.103
<i>Ater ignus, fusce fume.</i>

48:59.561 --> 49:04.817
<i>Te evoco ut potentium tuam monstres.</i>

49:04.900 --> 49:08.070
<i>Cupidibus flammis hic veni.</i>

49:08.695 --> 49:12.615
<i>Caelo sub isto, harc arborem consumo.</i>

49:13.032 --> 49:16.579
<i>Lucem tenebrasque tuas monstra.</i>

49:16.911 --> 49:21.041
<i>Impetuum tuum evoco ad devorandum.</i>

49:21.416 --> 49:25.420
<i>Hanc arborem ac omnes hospitas devora.</i>

49:44.981 --> 49:47.610
<i>And then they went up in hell flame.</i>

49:47.693 --> 49:51.030
<i>A gorgeous, searing inferno...</i>

49:51.489 --> 49:53.449
<i>consumed their souls.</i>

49:55.326 --> 49:57.327
Releasing their anger...

49:59.121 --> 50:01.623
until their charred bodies

50:01.706 --> 50:04.168
<i>fell from the sky...</i>

50:05.543 --> 50:07.003
<i>like ash.</i>

50:17.889 --> 50:19.289
<i>And once the witches</i>

50:19.349 --> 50:21.309
<i>who summoned
the Red Death were gone,</i>

50:21.393 --> 50:24.605
<i>and the wrath
that fueled him dissipated,</i>

50:25.146 --> 50:26.481
<i>the Angel, too...</i>

50:27.650 --> 50:29.275
<i>simply vanished</i>

50:29.360 --> 50:31.152
<i>as though he was never there.</i>

50:32.028 --> 50:36.407
<i>And just like that,
the witching hour was over.</i>

50:36.784 --> 50:39.536
And most everyone had survived the storm,

50:39.954 --> 50:45.668
little knowing how close
to annihilation they'd come.

50:59.681 --> 51:00.849
What happened tonight?

51:01.224 --> 51:03.978
I'm pretty sure your girlfriend just saved
the entire town.

51:05.563 --> 51:06.813
She's not my girlfriend.

51:08.106 --> 51:09.106
Not anymore.

51:11.110 --> 51:12.610
Why did you show up here?

51:12.695 --> 51:14.487
She asked me, so I came.

51:16.447 --> 51:17.447
No, but...

51:18.324 --> 51:19.324
why?

51:20.702 --> 51:21.702
Are you...

51:22.413 --> 51:25.081
- Are you, guys...
- She loves you, mortal.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.335
She'd die for you.

51:30.461 --> 51:32.047
Maybe that's worth forgiving her.

51:41.306 --> 51:44.351
Faustus, I'm sorry, but you were right.

51:44.434 --> 51:47.730
Lady Blackwood was too weak
to bring your baby into the world.

51:47.813 --> 51:50.858
Baby? I thought you said twins.

51:53.402 --> 51:57.572
Something strange
but not unheard of happened.

51:58.657 --> 52:02.369
One of your sons, the dominant one...

52:03.621 --> 52:04.996
consumed the other,

52:05.079 --> 52:07.791
the submissive one, in the womb.

52:10.168 --> 52:12.003
There is only one son...

52:12.670 --> 52:15.048
fortified by the brother he consumed.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.637
As it should be.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.472
Let me hold him.

52:33.733 --> 52:35.610
My only begotten son...

52:40.740 --> 52:41.824
and heir!

53:44.262 --> 53:47.974
I don't know what you said in that prayer
tonight, but it certainly worked.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.728
All the clouds are cleared.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.771
It's going to be a beautiful day,
Hilda Spellman.

54:05.117 --> 54:06.117
Goodnight.

54:32.351 --> 54:35.146
What happened to you earlier?

54:36.731 --> 54:40.402
Doesn't matter.
All's well that ends well, I suppose.

54:40.485 --> 54:41.320
Hilda...

54:41.402 --> 54:42.402
Yes?

54:42.570 --> 54:45.490
I've done something rather impulsive.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.375
Did you make a magic baby?

54:55.458 --> 54:56.626
It's Lady Blackwood's.

54:56.918 --> 54:57.753
Hm?

54:57.835 --> 55:02.173
A girl. I lied to Father Blackwood.
I said he only had one child.

55:02.632 --> 55:03.632
Why?

55:04.259 --> 55:06.302
To protect the babe, Hilda.

55:07.471 --> 55:10.056
She's a girl, born before her brother.

55:10.932 --> 55:14.228
And the High Priest,
I feared what he would've done to her.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.481
But we can raise her.
We've done it before.

55:17.940 --> 55:21.652
We'll keep it a secret, you and I.
Together, as sisters.

55:21.735 --> 55:22.735
Forever and ever!

55:22.820 --> 55:24.070
I'm moving out.

55:24.195 --> 55:25.195
What?

55:25.697 --> 55:29.284
I'm moving out... of this bedroom.

55:29.659 --> 55:32.954
I think it's time I had a room of my own.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.510
The Church of Night is ours, boys.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.389
This is the Dark Lord's sign.

55:51.472 --> 55:52.516
His blessing...

55:53.307 --> 55:55.018
that we are in the right.

55:56.603 --> 56:00.023
Hail to my firstborn son.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.025
Hail Judas!

56:02.150 --> 56:04.570
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!

56:04.652 --> 56:06.989
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!

56:07.072 --> 56:09.365
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!

56:09.449 --> 56:10.449
Hail Judas!

56:25.423 --> 56:27.634
You... changed your hair.

56:28.510 --> 56:29.594
Yeah.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.222
Thanks for sending that guy, Nick.

56:33.472 --> 56:34.472
He...

56:36.143 --> 56:37.853
He said you saved the whole town tonight.

56:39.146 --> 56:41.648
Well, it was a group effort.

56:44.650 --> 56:46.235
I wanted to check on you.

56:47.403 --> 56:50.282
And apologize again, Harvey.

56:51.365 --> 56:53.994
For all the secrets, for Tommy.

56:55.077 --> 56:56.079
For everything.

56:57.789 --> 57:00.208
I truly am sorry.

57:00.291 --> 57:01.293
I know.

57:03.795 --> 57:04.838
I know you are.

57:05.338 --> 57:06.882
So, what if you we start over?

57:09.259 --> 57:10.802
No more secrets this time. We just...

57:10.885 --> 57:11.885
I don't...

57:13.931 --> 57:15.806
I don't think that's such a good idea.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.186
I don't know if it's safe...

57:20.144 --> 57:21.480
for me to be around you.

57:22.313 --> 57:23.313
Or Roz...

57:24.231 --> 57:25.317
or Susie.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.400
Why not?

57:27.152 --> 57:29.028
I had to do something tonight...

57:31.197 --> 57:32.324
that scares me.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.032
Harvey...

57:36.619 --> 57:38.163
it touched something...

57:39.748 --> 57:42.166
dark inside me.

57:44.878 --> 57:48.465
I love you too much to risk
anything bad happening to you.

57:57.431 --> 57:58.431
Can I...

58:00.559 --> 58:02.144
Can I get one last kiss?

58:23.166 --> 58:25.085
<i>And that, as they say...</i>

58:25.835 --> 58:26.835
<i>was that.</i>

58:27.253 --> 58:29.505
All things according to his plan.

58:30.548 --> 58:33.385
Though I never really get
the credit I deserve.

58:34.719 --> 58:37.139
The best and worst things...

58:38.139 --> 58:39.391
happen in the shadows.

58:40.809 --> 58:45.438
Well, this is all a very long-winded way
of my telling you that...

58:47.190 --> 58:50.027
I'm an amazing teacher,
Principal Hawthorne.

58:51.445 --> 58:55.865
No one but me could've gotten Sabrina
so far along the Path of Night.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.452
Who the hell are you, lady?

59:02.039 --> 59:03.039
Who am I?

59:06.208 --> 59:08.085
Well, I'm not Mary Wardwell...

59:08.795 --> 59:10.505
though I do enjoy her body.

59:12.840 --> 59:16.719
I'm the Mother of Demons,
the Dawn of Doom,

59:17.471 --> 59:19.139
Satan's concubine.

59:20.639 --> 59:22.349
I'm Lilith, dear boy.

59:23.268 --> 59:24.686
First wife to Adam,

59:24.811 --> 59:27.898
saved from despair by a fallen angel.

59:28.731 --> 59:33.277
I call myself Madame Satan in his honor.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.155
But soon...

59:37.907 --> 59:38.907
very soon...

59:40.869 --> 59:42.536
I'll have a new title.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.246
You see...

59:47.125 --> 59:51.797
once I finish grooming Sabrina
to take my place as Satan's foot-soldier,

59:54.132 --> 59:58.094
I'll earn a crown
and a throne by his side.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:03.974
Who am I?

01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:17.655
I'm the future Queen of Hell.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:27.958
I did so leave you leftovers.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.086
Oh, stop squawking, and just say it.

01:00:32.753 --> 01:00:33.963
Forgive me, madame,

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.173
but doesn't it seem
that Satan is grooming Sabrina

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:38.467
to reign at his side, not you?

01:00:40.052 --> 01:00:44.974
But the Dark Lord wouldn't betray
my eternal service like that, Stolas.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.061
Even if he would,

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:53.023
there would be a very simple way
to deal with Sabrina.

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:10.876
She's still Sabrina, Harvey.

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:12.835
She's still the girl we know.

01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:14.461
I don't know, Susie.

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:16.005
Something had changed,

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:17.715
and not just her hair.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.927
But she's still coming to school, right?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.849
I mean, we're still her friends?
