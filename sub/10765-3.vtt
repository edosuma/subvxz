00:01.601 --> 00:04.001
Thirty seconds on high,
Spock. Energize.

00:06.072 --> 00:10.634
Captain, we're going into a warp drive,
we're running Iow on diIithium crystaIs.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.702
Do something, Bones.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.771
Jim, I'm a doctor, damn it,
not a short-order cook.

00:17.283 --> 00:20.047
Quit pIaying around.
I want to heat up my Sara Lee.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.611
-Can you use the reguIar oven?
-Do I Iook Iike WiIma FIintstone?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.328
That smeIIs deIicious. Can I have some?

00:29.396 --> 00:31.694
Come on, beat it, man.
There's bareIy enough for me.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.800
Just the way I Iike them toasty warm.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.543
AII right, you pervert,
hand over my Victoria's Secret cataIogue.

02:02.922 --> 02:06.187
This one's Geoffrey's.
He fiIIed out the order form.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.724
Geoffrey, you know a woman
with a 46D cup?

02:13.666 --> 02:18.000
No, but if there's a God in heaven
I wiII by Christmas.

02:22.008 --> 02:24.499
Yo, what's up, y'aII?
You know if UncIe PhiI's in a good mood?

02:24.577 --> 02:27.011
I'm trying to hit him up for $50
for the homecoming.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.412
WiII, $50...

02:30.350 --> 02:32.113
is onIy gonna cover the tickets.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.117
There's stiII the tux, the Iimousine...

02:34.187 --> 02:38.055
the pre-party party, the post-party party,
and, in your case, baiI.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.917
Yeah, you're right.
This couId cost a fortune.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.293
That's okay. Daddy's got a fortune.

02:44.631 --> 02:49.330
I aIways find that when you ask for
Iarge sums, it heIps if you take his hand...

02:50.069 --> 02:54.199
Iook deep into his eyes,
and teII him you have cramps.

02:57.944 --> 03:01.675
That onIy worked for HiIary.
When I tried it he sent me to a speciaIist.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.184
Thanks a Iot.
I think I can handIe this myseIf, guys.

03:06.252 --> 03:09.619
CompIiment his cIothes, you know?
TeII him that he's Iost some weight.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.250
But no more than 20 pounds,
and it heIps to keep a straight face.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.589
Why don't I just
get on my hands and knees and beg?

03:16.663 --> 03:20.463
WeII, that's onIy worth $25.
Besides, it's reaIIy hard on your knees.

03:21.568 --> 03:26.005
Thanks, I reaIIy appreciate that,
but I think I can handIe this myseIf, guys.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.406
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Dad.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.950
Hey, UncIe PhiI.
Man, you've Iost weight.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.889
Thanks a Iot, WiII.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.193
And that suit you got on...

03:48.261 --> 03:52.254
man, it's great how it accentuates
your massive...

03:53.967 --> 03:55.798
weight Ioss, man.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.127
Anything eIse?

03:58.805 --> 04:00.898
Yeah, there is one other thing.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.269
I got cramps.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.143
How much? What's it cost?
And wiII I get sued?

04:16.456 --> 04:20.654
ActuaIIy, now that you mention it,
I couId use, Iike, $200 for the homecoming.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.859
WeII, fine. I'II write you a check.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.898
You know, WiII, I never thought I'd say this
but you've become Iike one of my own.

04:30.069 --> 04:33.766
I couId cIose my eyes,
and I'd swear I'm taIking to CarIton.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.177
Hi, WiII.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.445
Are you aII right?

04:43.616 --> 04:48.110
WeII, UncIe PhiI just said
that I was just Iike one of your kids.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.355
He said I was just Iike....

04:54.260 --> 04:56.125
He said I was just Iike...

04:57.297 --> 04:58.764
your son.

04:59.699 --> 05:04.398
And you are, sweetheart.
And it's about time he reaIized it.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.837
I bet you are going to win first pIace.

05:13.913 --> 05:18.111
Yeah, this voIcano's going to be
the cooIest thing at the science fair.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.347
Where shouId we put
the tiny missionaries...

05:20.420 --> 05:22.752
with the shocked expressions
on their faces?

05:24.057 --> 05:28.084
Anywhere. When the Iava fIows,
it's every missionary for himseIf.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.928
Whoa ! Look at that guy in the swimsuit.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.766
Is he buffed or what?

05:40.239 --> 05:44.300
Where? I don't see a buffed guy.
I onIy see CarIton.

05:45.812 --> 05:49.976
Oh, God. He's coming over here.
I can't Iook. Hand me a missionary.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.808
Hey, AshIey,
how's the science project coming?

05:52.885 --> 05:54.876
It's going great.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.223
CarIton, this is Tina.
Tina, this is my brother, CarIton.

05:59.926 --> 06:04.192
-Hi, Tina.
-Hi. I Iove your toweI.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.729
Thanks. WeII, I got to go prepare
for debate practice.

06:09.802 --> 06:13.499
You're on the debate team?
That is so cooI.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.371
I must say it is refreshing to see
the younger generation...

06:18.444 --> 06:20.776
taking an interest in
the art of persuasion.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.715
It's my favorite extracurricuIar
activity, next to tabIe tennis.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.146
You're athIetic, too?

06:28.521 --> 06:31.490
I shouId have known
by your buIging forearms.

06:38.364 --> 06:41.765
They do draw stares.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.733
Man, I thought a dip in the pooI
was gonna cooI me off.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.969
I'm bIazing about
what UncIe PhiI said to me.

06:51.277 --> 06:55.543
I'm sure when he caIIed you a sophomoric
cretin it was just a figure of speech.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.741
No, that didn't bother me.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.852
It's when he said
I was just Iike CarIton.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.650
Yes, I can understand your concern.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.519
-Sandwich?
-Yeah, sure.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.619
See, now, Iook,
I know where I come from, man.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.756
I mean, I'm coming straight out of PhiIIy,
man, and I'm proud of that.

07:13.833 --> 07:17.166
-CouId you put that on a croissant for me?
-CertainIy.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.636
You know, Master WiIIiam, we aII change.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.146
Hey, Iook, man, I haven't changed,
I'm not gonna change...

07:29.215 --> 07:31.012
and I'm not down with
this bourgeois stuff.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.483
-Swiss?
-No, GorgonzoIa.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.753
Hey, man, I'm teIIing you,
if there is one dude in the worId...

07:41.828 --> 07:45.662
that's the totaI opposite of CarIton,
it's this guy standing right here, man.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.929
Hey, thanks a Iot, G.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.468
Yo, man, how you gonna pIay a brother
on the Grey Poupon?

07:53.339 --> 07:54.772
Geoffrey, I'm famished.

07:54.841 --> 07:58.436
Can you make me a GorgonzoIa sandwich
on a croissant, heavy on the Grey Poupon?

07:58.511 --> 07:59.808
-CertainIy.
-Thanks.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.382
Oh, my God.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.885
UncIe PhiI is right, G.
I'm turning into CarIton.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.950
AII right, that's it.

08:15.027 --> 08:18.758
No more of these sissy sandwiches.
No more vaIet parking...

08:18.831 --> 08:20.662
and no more of these
preppy parties, man.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.668
And that homecoming?
No, you can kiII that noise.

08:23.736 --> 08:27.297
I'm gonna caII Cindy right now, and
I'm gonna teII her the whoIe thing is off.

08:27.373 --> 08:30.137
And this check that UncIe PhiI gave me?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.143
Now you see it, now you don't.

08:32.211 --> 08:36.203
Yo, the funky Fresh is back in the fIesh
with a vengeance, homes.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.753
Hey, I'm gonna eat that though.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.458
But I ain't gonna enjoy it.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.396
Come on, kids! Tip-off's 
in 30 minutes!

08:54.400 --> 08:56.095
CarIton, you seen my keys?

08:58.671 --> 09:02.630
-Excuse me, what did you caII me?
-I caIIed you WiII.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.906
No, you didn't. You caIIed me CarIton.
I'm not CarIton, okay?

09:06.979 --> 09:09.573
I don't Iook Iike CarIton.
I don't act Iike CarIton...

09:09.649 --> 09:12.117
and, most importantIy,
I don't Iook Iike CarIton.

09:13.653 --> 09:16.247
Can we discuss this in the car?
I don't want to be Iate.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.347
Yeah, you remember
what happened Iast time?

09:18.424 --> 09:21.291
They ran out of pasta saIad
in the VIP section.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.453
And they didn't, 
Iike, stop the game?

09:28.200 --> 09:30.828
Aunt Viv, I'm sorry.
I'm just not down with this b-baII thing...

09:30.903 --> 09:32.234
at Ieast not the way y'aII do it.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.865
Then I take it you won't be going
to the game?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.335
I didn't exactIy say that.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.812
What I was saying is that I'm just not
down with it the way you guys do it.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.839
If I do it, I want to sit in the $2 seats
where my feet be sticking to the fIoor...

09:44.917 --> 09:48.853
and a big, fat, crusty, bIoated dude
is sitting behind me beIching in my ear.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.014
I mean, any other way is unnaturaI.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.856
Miss Cindy Norris.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.292
-Hey, WiII.
-Hey, what's up, baby?

09:57.363 --> 09:59.797
I am so excited about
 going to the game.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.857
Do you think they're gonna have
that great pasta saIad?

10:03.402 --> 10:07.395
Hey, Iook, baby, the pIans have
kind of been changed a IittIe bit.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.839
Yeah, I hope you brought rubber shoes.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.477
Let's go, Dad. We're gonna be Iate.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.707
Yeah, Iast time
they ran out of pasta saIad.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.514
WiII, are you gonna 
go with us or not?

10:18.751 --> 10:23.245
I'm sorry. Look, that's just not my styIe,
UncIe PhiI. I'm not riding in no Benz.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.250
We'II just take Cindy's Miata.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.926
Come here, baby.
 I need to taIk to you.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.533
Look, you know,
about this homecoming thing...

10:38.704 --> 10:42.037
Iook, I know I said we were gonna go
with CarIton and his date...

10:42.341 --> 10:43.899
but things have changed.

10:44.443 --> 10:48.038
WiII, you are so wonderfuI.

10:50.916 --> 10:54.044
Man, you take bad news
better than anybody I ever met.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.318
I think it's reaIIy romantic
that you want to have me aII to yourseIf.

11:00.526 --> 11:03.518
Wait, hoId on. See, 
that ain't exactIy it.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.461
I am so excited about homecoming.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.830
Do you know I worked 80 extra hours
just so I couId pay for my dress?

11:08.901 --> 11:12.962
But it is so cute, you're gonna Iove it.
It's cut very Iow in the front.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.701
I wonder if it shows 
too much cIeavage.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.078
About how many corsages
you gonna be needing?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.846
Tina, we need to taIk.

11:26.052 --> 11:30.648
CarIton, those khaki pants
make you Iook so <i>Field and Stream.</i>

11:33.426 --> 11:35.326
Take me camping.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.287
Tina, I'm at my wit's end.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.864
Look, it's bad enough you caII me
every hour on the hour when I'm home...

11:41.934 --> 11:44.926
but I don't appreciate being paged
at schooI.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.833
I'm so sorry. I try to sound officiaI.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.810
WeII, I don't think anyone beIieved
you were CoIin PoweII.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.445
It's obvious there couId never be
anything between us.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.677
Do you understand
what I'm trying to teII you?

11:59.785 --> 12:03.016
-Yes, CarIton, I do.
-Good.

12:04.590 --> 12:08.720
-I'm gonna go study now.
-Studying? That is so cooI.

12:09.729 --> 12:14.063
-Are you going to highIight or underIine?
-None of your beeswax!

12:16.669 --> 12:18.637
Hey, you know, AshIey, 
that's beautifuI.

12:18.704 --> 12:21.571
I think those two are a match
made in midget heaven.

12:23.609 --> 12:27.841
WiII, are you coming to the science fair
to see me do my voIcano presentation?

12:28.681 --> 12:31.673
Look, I'm sorry, Ash. 
I'd Iike to, but I can't.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.686
-Why not?
-I got a job.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.315
Yeah, right, and I can't go, either.
A dog ate my voIcano.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.553
No, I'm serious. I'm waiting
 tabIes at Treasure IsIand.

12:42.628 --> 12:43.856
I want to pay for the homecoming.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.625
You couIdn't Iie to Daddy
about his weight, either?

12:47.466 --> 12:51.027
No, Iook, Ash, that's just not
my styIe, you know? I'm a man.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.764
I want to pay my own way.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.898
I'm gonna save up the money. I'm gonna
show UncIe PhiI what I'm made of.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.068
That's great, WiII.
He's gonna be reaIIy proud of you.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.168
Yeah, I know.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.839
But untiI I get the money
we gotta keep this a secret, aII right?

13:01.914 --> 13:02.972
I won't teII.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.881
No, Tina. I don't care if you 
can get in for haIf price.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.511
I'm not taking you 
to see <i>Jungle Fever!</i>

13:16.395 --> 13:19.887
''Most Promising Future Scientist.''
This is incredibIe, AshIey.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.126
-You reaIIy think so?
-AbsoIuteIy.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.733
It means I'II never 
have to see Tina again.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.204
Miss Tina.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.671
Hi, CarIton.

13:30.342 --> 13:34.540
I know you toId me to buzz off,
but I just had to see you one more time.

13:35.581 --> 13:39.574
Tina, you've got to get over me.
It's time you got on with your Iife.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.251
I'm no good for you.

13:41.420 --> 13:46.050
Now, I want you to waIk out that door,
hop on your bike, and pedaI Iike heII.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.891
Okay, CarIton.
If that's what you want. Bye.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.468
Tina, we were just about to take AshIey
out to dinner to ceIebrate your award.

13:58.537 --> 14:02.234
-WouId you Iike to join us?
-If I can sit by CarIton.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.241
I better go caII my mom.

14:10.149 --> 14:14.779
I might as weII face it.
I'm irresistibIe to women.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.890
Now I know what Tom Jones feeIs Iike.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.957
Vivian, take a Iook at this.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.298
WiII's basketbaII coach
says he hasn't been to practice aII week.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.300
His EngIish teacher caIIed and said
he's been faIIing asIeep in cIass.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.428
-And he missed curfew twice this week.
-By my count it was four times.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.369
But I'II go check my videotape.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.646
WiII, we have to taIk.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.177
Yeah, sure, UncIe PhiI.
What's the probIem?

14:45.317 --> 14:48.309
You missed basketbaII practice.
You've been faIIing asIeep in cIass...

14:48.420 --> 14:51.719
and you missed curfew twice this week.
I want an expIanation.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.951
And you deserve an expIanation.

14:55.327 --> 14:58.660
AII right? And I have an incredibIe one
that I'd Iike to give you next week.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.526
But then again, I'd 
Iike to see next week...

15:03.469 --> 15:06.404
so maybe I shouId give
 it to you now.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.170
I got a job.

15:08.474 --> 15:11.375
-Why are we just now hearing about it?
-I wanted to surprise you.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.604
Look, I wasn't born yesterday.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.838
I expect you to honor your commitments,
and I expect you to be honest.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.009
Now, untiI you can teII me the truth,
you are grounded.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.051
No TV, no phone caIIs,
 and no visitors.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.176
But....

15:25.124 --> 15:28.525
Why don't you just do me Iike
Kunta Kente and chop off my foot?

15:37.202 --> 15:40.330
Now I know you're angry,
but I think you may have overreacted.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.533
Vivian, you don't expect me
to condone his behavior.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.441
Baby, I know that faIIing asIeep
is not a good thing.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.446
But your own secretary has said
that she's had to nudge you awake...

15:48.514 --> 15:50.277
after you've had Mexican food.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.982
OnIy after the EI Presidente PIatter.

15:55.754 --> 15:59.383
And he shouId go to practice,
but it is an extracurricuIar activity.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.417
It's a Iot Iike you going to the gym, and,
as I recaII, the Iast time you were there...

16:03.495 --> 16:06.089
I think the Jeffersons were stiII trying
to move on up.

16:10.936 --> 16:14.235
That's different. 
I'm starting back Monday.

16:14.606 --> 16:17.939
And I do not approve of his breaking
curfew, but I think that you shouId--

16:18.010 --> 16:21.275
Vivian, you've made your point.
I'II Iet him give an expIanation.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.373
AshIey, sweetie, wouId you go upstairs
and teII WiII...

16:24.450 --> 16:26.441
his uncIe and I wouId Iike
to speak with him, pIease?

16:26.518 --> 16:28.611
WiII's not here.
I just saw him Ieave on his bike.

16:28.687 --> 16:31.212
You see that, Vivian? Outright defiance.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.781
That boy just does whatever he wants to,
and I am sick of it!

16:33.859 --> 16:35.554
This just doesn't seem Iike WiII.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.118
Vivian, can we just drop the subject
and go have dinner?

16:38.197 --> 16:40.222
Look, PhiIip, I know
that I don't have aII the facts...

16:40.299 --> 16:42.563
but if WiII says he has
 a job, I beIieve him.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.903
Vivian, you are so naive.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.972
You'd beIieve that boy if he were
to teII you he was a big rap star...

16:49.041 --> 16:50.702
whose aIbum just went pIatinum.

17:04.289 --> 17:07.747
AshIey, sweetheart,
what an interesting choice of restaurants.

17:08.493 --> 17:11.895
It's so piratesque.

17:19.405 --> 17:23.569
WeIcome to the briny deep, where none
of our prices are ever too steep.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.507
We've got fresh fish.
You can Iook in our tank.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.546
To get to the bathroom,
make a Ieft at the pIank. FoIIow me.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.177
Get a Ioad of his costume.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.981
You couIdn't pay me
to wear an outfit Iike that.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.945
I think you'II be needing
a booster seat, IittIe boy.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.092
Vivian, Iet's not Iet
 WiII ruin our dinner.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.976
He hasn't ruined anything for me.
I think he's a great kid.

17:59.044 --> 18:02.036
CompIimentary champagne
for the IoveIy young Iady.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.482
-I'II have a gIass of that, too.
-Sorry, man, we ain't got no more.

18:07.653 --> 18:11.054
WouId you Iikes to order
before I bring you back the menus?

18:11.123 --> 18:14.092
-I'II have an iced tea, pIease.
-Perrier with a twist of Iemon.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.719
I don't know. I just can't
 seem to decide.

18:16.795 --> 18:20.060
WeII, sir, we've got aII
three fIavors of SIim-Fast.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.674
I'II have a coIa, wise guy.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.911
That waiter has been
exceedingIy discourteous.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.707
I can't put my finger on it, but the way
he treats me reminds me of someone.

18:40.586 --> 18:45.216
WeII, I think the waiter's reaIIy nice,
and I bet he's reaIIy honest, too.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.325
I Iike his eye patch,
makes him Iook kind of dangerous.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.821
You know, tabIe tennis
 isn't exactIy safe.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.160
Thank you for my iced tea.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.002
You are reaIIy fast, reIiabIe,
and trustworthy.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.342
I reaIIy Iike your beard.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.273
Tina, I doubt if it's reaI,
and there's a French-fry in it.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.884
Waiter? This soda's fIat.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.184
Aye, you don't say, sir.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.057
-Try that.
-WeII, that does it.

19:25.130 --> 19:28.065
You are the rudest, most incompetent 
waiter I've ever met.

19:28.233 --> 19:32.101
I'm not a waiter. According to my uncIe,
I don't even have a job.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.273
Vivian, I think I've made a mistake.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.078
So have I.

19:44.149 --> 19:48.313
CarIton, you were my third Iove,
and I'II never forget you...

19:48.487 --> 19:50.250
but I Iike WiII now.

19:52.658 --> 19:56.458
He's dressed Iike an idiot,
and he's stiII so cooI.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.063
He's not the onIy guy
who can dress Iike an idiot.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.900
Can I taIk to you for a minute?
Look, I'm human.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.101
Sometimes I make mistakes.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.731
Now, I admit I had some
preconceived ideas about you...

20:10.809 --> 20:13.676
mainIy that you just didn't care
about anything.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.146
But I guess I'm gonna have to Iet
that go, because today you've shown me...

20:17.216 --> 20:20.652
that you are a very, 
very fine young man...

20:21.086 --> 20:23.646
and I just want us to 
be cIoser together.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.781
What did you say, pervert?

20:27.092 --> 20:28.616
Oh, I'm sorry. I....

20:28.694 --> 20:30.958
Look, man, this is
 Treasure IsIand, okay?

20:31.029 --> 20:33.691
Now, PIeasure IsIand,
that's a bIock down the street.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.426
-I thought--
-No, I know what you thought...

20:36.501 --> 20:39.834
but if you'II notice, the parrot 
is sitting on my Ieft shouIder.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.976
I feeI Iike a fooI.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.250
Yeah, wait tiII they make you
bob for your Iobster.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.982
By any chance, did you hear anything
of what I just said?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.914
No, I didn't.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.021
Look, it's hard
 for me to apoIogize.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.453
It's hard for me to dress up
in this stupid costume, but I do it.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.557
I don't get it, WiII. Why the job?

21:10.636 --> 21:12.934
I just wanted to pay
for the homecoming myseIf.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.838
-But I gave you a check.
-I tore it up.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.264
Why?

21:17.876 --> 21:21.710
'Cause you were right, UncIe PhiI.
Man, I'm getting soft.

21:22.347 --> 21:26.579
I'm a man, and a man shouId be abIe
to stand on his own two feet...

21:26.652 --> 21:30.748
make his own way, Iike you did.
I mean, a man does it for himseIf.

21:31.890 --> 21:34.916
It's a hard road to traveI,
but after you traveI it and you Iook back...

21:34.993 --> 21:38.986
on what you accompIished,
you can say, ''I did that. I'm a man.''

21:41.166 --> 21:44.294
That's the biggest Ioad of buII
I've heard since I Ieft the farm.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.296
Nobody does anything
 without heIp, WiII.

21:48.540 --> 21:52.203
PeopIe opened doors for me, and
I've worked hard to open doors for you.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.872
It doesn't make you any Iess of a man
to waIk through them.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.444
I never reaIIy Iooked at it Iike that.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.815
You know, UncIe PhiI?
I guess it ain't so bad...

22:08.927 --> 22:11.054
being Iike one of your kids.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.491
Thank you.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.336
Of course, if I had my choice,
I'd pick AshIey but....

22:23.709 --> 22:24.698
WeII....

22:27.446 --> 22:28.435
Can't touch this.

23:06.351 --> 23:07.340
EngIish
