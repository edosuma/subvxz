15:17.583 --> 15:19.500
Everything I do is for God.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.916
[Erzsebet] I don't want to kill her.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.875
Did you think I wanted to kill her?

15:25.583 --> 15:27.625
What primitive minds you people have.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.208
It never ceases to shock me.

15:30.916 --> 15:32.541
Of course, yes,

15:32.625 --> 15:34.791
back in the mists of time,

15:34.875 --> 15:38.250
longer ago than your primitive minds
can imagine,

15:38.333 --> 15:40.083
when the Earth itself was young,

15:40.708 --> 15:45.375
back then, I was honored many times
with human sacrifice.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.791
A virgin, obviously.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.000
Are you a virgin?

15:53.416 --> 15:56.000
But no, I don't want to kill her.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.458
On the contrary.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.833
I'm going to give her eternal life.

We have to go back.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.416
[straining] Coward! Let me go.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.375
You can't fight Erzsebet.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.833
Then you fight her.
You're the powerful vampire.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.500
Not powerful enough.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.041
She'll kill them!

16:51.125 --> 16:53.416
If you go back, she'll kill you.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.083
And I don't want you to die, Mizrak.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.416
[Mizrak sighs]

17:07.291 --> 17:08.833
You wouldn't understand.

17:09.500 --> 17:13.208
You're an animal
which lost its soul centuries ago.

I promised her paradise. Not this.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.541
But this is even better.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.291
Paradise on Earth.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.833
[sad, ethereal music playing]

18:21.916 --> 18:24.083
It has to be someone he loves.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.708
-He loves me. Ask him.
-What are you doing?

18:27.291 --> 18:28.625
Interesting.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.666
Maybe he does.

18:30.750 --> 18:31.791
[shudders]

18:32.750 --> 18:36.333
The holy man,
tempted by sins of the flesh.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.458
But it wouldn't be any old temptation,
no, no, no, no, no.

18:40.541 --> 18:41.375
[shuddering]

18:41.458 --> 18:44.708
[Drolta] It would be something
worth risking damnation for.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.708
But the virgin. Shouldn't I have a virgin?

18:47.791 --> 18:50.375
I'm a Speaker. A sorceress.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.916
I remember you.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.958
You killed your own sister.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.458
Think what a vampire I'll be.

18:59.541 --> 19:01.208
Powerful. Devoted.

Let the others go.

20:19.875 --> 20:24.666
You need me. This is an alliance.
You can't crush the revolution without me.

20:24.750 --> 20:29.291
Oh, yes.
You and your army of night creatures.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.583
