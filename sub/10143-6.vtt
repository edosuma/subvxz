Gerald Crawford.

00:04.089 --> 00:05.589
He's Latif's
chief armory.

00:05.675 --> 00:06.875
You have the weapons
ready?

00:06.900 --> 00:09.598
No. But I have this as
collateral.

00:11.022 --> 00:12.222
That man that you murdered...

00:14.433 --> 00:15.959
He's my fiance.

00:15.984 --> 00:17.979
- Damien?
- Hey, Maggie.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.577
Just give me the
headlines. Is it juicy?

00:19.602 --> 00:23.353
That arms deal was a ransom
payment for my daughter.

00:24.141 --> 00:25.341
Clare! Stay down!

00:25.903 --> 00:28.816
Get me my daughter back,
and I'll give you Latif.

00:28.841 --> 00:30.041
Let's move!

00:31.494 --> 00:32.694
Ahhh!

Get out!

01:06.542 --> 01:09.244
Why?

01:09.278 --> 01:14.816
Unlike your father, I am
a man who keeps his word.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.986
Allah.

01:20.357 --> 01:23.460
You wish to
bury your fiance.

01:23.494 --> 01:28.332
Go there and find him.
I will wait, while you dig.

01:36.576 --> 01:42.749
Oh!

01:42.783 --> 01:47.286
This is the journey your
father has sent you on.

01:47.321 --> 01:48.488
No...

01:49.590 --> 01:52.425
This is where it ends.

01:54.995 --> 01:57.397
Your old life is over now.

01:58.933 --> 02:03.870
You have only a
new one...with me.

02:03.905 --> 02:05.940
Do you desire it?

02:07.242 --> 02:12.746
If not, I will leave you
here to lie with him.

02:12.814 --> 02:15.116
Make your choice.

02:15.150 --> 02:18.586
Tahir... No.

02:18.621 --> 02:22.390
Please...just, just
wait, don't please.

02:23.025 --> 02:24.392

without me, go ahead.

04:31.786 --> 04:33.353
He's doing what?

Get me satellite surveillance
on a 50-mile grid around

04:35.241 --> 04:36.351
the exchange point.

04:36.356 --> 04:38.190
Where's Scott?

04:38.225 --> 04:41.093
I had to bring him back Khartoum along
with that bloody journalist woman.

04:42.396 --> 04:44.096
He took a bullet to the spleen.

04:44.131 --> 04:45.532
<i>He's lost a lot of blood.</i>

You've let Stonebridge go

04:50.647 --> 04:53.950
mission, with the only lead...
to Latif... Please tell me

04:53.950 --> 04:56.059
Crawford gave you
the intel beforehand.

04:56.309 --> 04:57.876
- Negative...
- Sinclair.

04:57.911 --> 04:59.745
And I think I'm about
to get arrested.

04:59.779 --> 05:01.513
Walk away now, you
don't know me, go.

05:31.942 --> 05:34.252
Wait, wait, wait...

05:37.293 --> 05:39.060
There are two wells near here.

05:39.883 --> 05:42.285
The Janjaweed will
be close to one.

05:42.319 --> 05:46.356
The nearest is Bir
an Natrun...that way.

05:46.390 --> 05:49.726
And we're trusting him
as our guide, why exactly?

05:49.760 --> 05:52.061
It was Tahir's men
who destroyed my village.

05:52.746 --> 05:53.946
And my family.

05:56.267 --> 05:59.021
And, your friend, Scott, he
promised me much money.

05:59.046 --> 06:01.201
And a new car if I help you,
yes?

06:01.872 --> 06:04.306
You gotta love that
mercenary spirit.

06:05.608 --> 06:09.578
So, what's your reason?

06:09.612 --> 06:14.783
This isn't only about Latif, is
it? Not for you.

06:14.818 --> 06:17.653
If we don't get a signal
soon, get some back-up...

06:17.687 --> 06:19.755
We're driving towards
Clare in a hearse.

06:27.932 --> 06:32.635
Fuck... I'm not going to hurt
you, I need some drugs.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.905
Adrenaline...
Something to keep me going.

06:35.939 --> 06:38.598
If you come with me, I can
get you your drugs, and

06:38.623 --> 06:40.182
examine your wound also.

06:40.411 --> 06:44.013
There are soldiers here,
they're looking for me.

06:44.048 --> 06:46.516
Why?

06:46.550 --> 06:50.954
I was trying to rescue
a woman. She's a doctor.

06:51.022 --> 06:54.157
She got kidnapped
by the Janjaweed.

06:54.192 --> 06:56.226
Her name's
Clare Somersby.

06:56.261 --> 06:57.995
- The aid worker?
- Yeah.

06:58.029 --> 07:00.965
She's going to die...

07:01.000 --> 07:05.337
Along with a lot of other
people, if you don't help me.

07:05.371 --> 07:09.475
Okay...
So, please?

07:14.848 --> 07:17.783
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge
on any of the satellite feeds...

07:17.818 --> 07:20.786
Widen your grid reference.
What about Matak?

07:20.820 --> 07:22.675
According to
his office, he's away on

07:22.700 --> 07:24.258
an official engagement.
- No, He's stalling...

07:24.259 --> 07:26.260
He's just hoping nothing
will stick to him.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.395
See if she was arrested, as well,
and get me on a flight to Khartoum.

07:30.430 --> 07:32.731
I'm gonna have to deal
with this personally.

08:07.031 --> 08:11.969
Thank you.
I need a phone.

08:12.003 --> 08:15.594
I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.

08:15.619 --> 08:16.819
I'm sorry.

08:17.309 --> 08:19.410
Hey... What do you
mean, the other one?

08:19.444 --> 08:22.113
Hendricks. He came
in last night.

08:22.147 --> 08:24.483
He'd been in a car accident.

08:24.517 --> 08:27.753
I have to go.

08:45.506 --> 08:47.707
It's when I'm nervous...

08:47.741 --> 08:50.259
I used to sing that
song to my children...

08:50.284 --> 08:51.484
When they are scared...

08:51.546 --> 08:54.114
To help them sleep.

08:54.149 --> 08:56.139
And now, whenever
I am frightened...

08:56.164 --> 08:57.364
Beautiful story...

08:57.485 --> 08:59.886
Now shut the fuck up.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.293
Shit.

09:06.327 --> 09:11.631
Hey, hey. No, no. They are
Masalit. Villagers. Farmers.

09:11.666 --> 09:14.901
Why are they running?

09:14.935 --> 09:17.670
That's why.
Janjaweed.

09:17.704 --> 09:19.505
What do we do?

09:19.539 --> 09:21.974
Depends how many there are.

09:22.008 --> 09:24.443
Let's take one
alive and find out.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.861
Yah...

09:48.030 --> 09:50.731
Take the wheel.
What?

10:03.945 --> 10:05.646
Drive right up beside him!

10:13.254 --> 10:15.688
Son of a bitch.

10:21.895 --> 10:26.098
Jacoub! Get out there
and translate for me.

10:26.132 --> 10:28.600
He's going to tell us
where the camp is.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.791
Hmm?

10:59.327 --> 11:05.664
If you become Tahir's woman,
it will make you safe.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.133
And you also.
I promise.

11:11.603 --> 11:13.938
You cannot save everyone.

11:16.775 --> 11:19.644
That's what Bakri said.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.717
But saving even one person,
surely, would be something.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.859
If we'd used sniper rifles,
instead of driving straight at them...

11:34.894 --> 11:36.828
We could've picked
them off easy.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.325
Jacoub, we're good, if we
stay in this direction, yeah?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.165
Yes, that way.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.068
No point in rescuing Clare
if we can't all get out again.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.120
You do want to get home,
don't you? See your wife?

11:46.145 --> 11:47.641
That's a wedding ring, right?

11:49.377 --> 11:52.679
What about kids?
Got any of them?

11:52.713 --> 11:55.105
Okay, no kids. Your
marriage is shit. That's

11:55.130 --> 11:56.330
starting to make more sense...

11:56.351 --> 11:58.085
Don't fucking shrink me!

11:58.119 --> 12:00.021
You have no idea what the
fuck you're talking about.

12:00.055 --> 12:02.390
I know self-loathing
when I see it.

12:02.424 --> 12:05.193
How reckless that can make
a man. That's why I'm here.

12:05.228 --> 12:07.429
Only I want to rescue
Clare, not die trying.

12:07.464 --> 12:11.233
Now, we're professional
fucking soldiers. We
got a job to do...

12:11.267 --> 12:13.201
You're not a
fucking soldier.

12:13.236 --> 12:14.870
You're a scumbag arms
dealer, selling mass murder.

12:14.904 --> 12:17.339
So, yes, you should
fucking hate yourself.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.674
That's why Clare hates
you too, right?

12:19.709 --> 12:21.342
But that's your shit
to work out, not mine.

12:21.376 --> 12:24.144
I don't give a fuck if
she forgives you or not.

12:24.179 --> 12:26.346
I'm here for one reason
and one reason only.

12:26.381 --> 12:27.640
And that's to get that
information on Latif.

12:27.665 --> 12:28.514
No...

12:28.560 --> 12:30.364
Which I'm starting to think
is just some bullshit...

12:30.451 --> 12:32.852
story you're selling...
I'll keep my part of the deal.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.088
Really, Crawford?
Redemption costs.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.922
And on my watch, you
fucking pay up front.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.932
Everything you know about
Latif. Or I put a fucking

12:38.957 --> 12:40.201
bullet in your head right now.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.971
Latif has a spy at the top
of British intelligence.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.040
Neutralize him, and you'll stop
the atrocity Latif has planned.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.877
He can't finalize the
arrangements without him.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.302
Who is he? I need a name.

12:58.814 --> 13:02.015
When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.

13:02.050 --> 13:04.368
Oh, you need Clare safe,
as much as I do.

13:04.393 --> 13:05.693
You wouldn't be here otherwise.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.555
People die. I'm
fine with that.

13:11.426 --> 13:12.993
You fucking prick.

13:13.027 --> 13:14.862
Shoot, then.

13:24.506 --> 13:26.408
Fuck.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.872
Hello, Maggie.
I'm Eleanor Grant.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.275
Can I get you a drink?

13:57.310 --> 14:00.312
No, but can you can turn off
the recording device in your pocket.

14:02.048 --> 14:03.910
This conversation is off
the record. We never met.

14:03.935 --> 14:05.934
Do you understand?

14:05.934 --> 14:07.780
Damien said you
were a ball breaker.

14:08.687 --> 14:12.923
Well, Damien Scott talks too
much and to people he shouldn't.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.258
He knows he can trust me.

14:15.293 --> 14:17.326
I protect my sources. That's
why I'm here talking to you.

14:17.351 --> 14:18.551
I want to protect him.

14:18.829 --> 14:20.463
Why were you not
arrested also?

14:20.497 --> 14:22.782
Nobody knew I was there,
just taking photos.

14:22.807 --> 14:25.504
Damien looks after me too.

14:25.835 --> 14:28.270
Right, I'm gonna need
copies of all the photos.

14:28.304 --> 14:31.192
No way. But I will
promise not to use any

14:31.217 --> 14:32.850
that compromise your team.

14:33.409 --> 14:35.744
I think you
misunderstood me.

14:35.778 --> 14:38.480
All photos, now.

14:38.514 --> 14:40.503
You do not publish until this
is over.

14:40.528 --> 14:42.846
You make no mention
of my unit or personnel.

14:43.653 --> 14:46.989
Or what?
You gonna kill me?

14:47.023 --> 14:48.657
Mmm-hmm.

15:01.004 --> 15:02.905
I can't see her.

15:08.411 --> 15:10.146
Christ, there's
a lot of them.

15:10.180 --> 15:12.982
We're heading out soon. Once they've
juiced themselves up for the night.

15:17.821 --> 15:22.858
That's him. That's the one
we kill, no matter what.

15:40.076 --> 15:41.509
Why isn't he
leaving with them?

15:46.715 --> 15:51.084
She's in that hut. She's
in that hut with him.

15:59.326 --> 16:03.996
I trust you have been treated
appropriately, Major Sinclair.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.633
Yes, thank you.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.407
Colonel Grant.
<i>As-Salaam Aleikom.</i>

16:15.442 --> 16:17.209
<i>Wa alaikum assalaam.</i>

16:17.243 --> 16:23.592
Sit, please. It is a tragedy
how things have turned out.

16:23.617 --> 16:24.484
Okay.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.486
Then let us work
to resolve it.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.421
Indeed, yes.

16:28.455 --> 16:33.727
All along, I have tried merely
to facilitate this poor girl's return.

16:33.761 --> 16:36.963
As your Major
Sinclair can confirm.

16:36.998 --> 16:39.032
Yes.

16:39.067 --> 16:41.769
Well, I'm glad you now accept
my men were not responsible

16:41.794 --> 16:42.994
for the shoot-out.

16:43.237 --> 16:47.240
The shoot-out.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:47.275 --> 16:49.910
Although, there is still
a fatal traffic incident...

16:49.944 --> 16:53.079
About which we must
question Mr. Scott.

16:53.114 --> 16:56.883
If he can recover from
his wounds, of course.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.918
I understood he
survived the surgery.

16:58.952 --> 17:05.358
So far, yes, but
complications do occur.

17:06.961 --> 17:09.429
Hmm... May I visit him?

17:09.463 --> 17:13.699
Alas, no. He is
still under arrest.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.569
As for Mr. Stonebridge
and Mr. Crawford...

17:18.604 --> 17:22.772
Tomorrow, we will send
troops into the desert.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.173
I only pray we find
them, before the bandits

17:25.198 --> 17:26.397
who have his daughter.

17:27.478 --> 17:30.880
It would be
deeply regrettable...

17:30.914 --> 17:35.185
If all my men brought back...
were their two corpses.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.651
Rest assured, Minister.

17:42.867 --> 17:44.920
That if none of them
make it back...

17:45.496 --> 17:49.298
Then the photographs they
took at the exchange...

17:49.333 --> 17:53.370
Tell a story I think most of
us would rather keep private.

17:55.706 --> 17:57.706
Thank you, Minister.

17:58.675 --> 17:59.975
Major.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.085
Yeah, I've
got your back. Move.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.062
What is it?

18:50.096 --> 18:56.636
<i>Arak.</i> Drink.
Then we shall eat.

19:15.391 --> 19:17.559
Come on, get
it together.

19:25.533 --> 19:29.603
Do you wish to know how much
your father thinks you are worth?

19:29.637 --> 19:31.439
I have no father.

19:31.473 --> 19:34.942
You are all
of his world.

19:34.976 --> 19:40.047
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.

19:44.086 --> 19:46.587
Let's just get this
over with, shall we?

19:59.969 --> 20:02.937
Help me! Help me!

20:02.972 --> 20:07.041
Stop, help me!

20:07.076 --> 20:10.445
Subin!
She is not your concern.

20:10.512 --> 20:12.948
She is an  <i>abid,</i>
<i>a slave...</i>

20:12.982 --> 20:14.949
No, she is a nurse,
and my friend.

20:14.984 --> 20:18.286
And you
wish to save her?

20:18.321 --> 20:19.260
Help me! Help me!

20:19.261 --> 20:23.932
No... No, I... I wish you
to. I desire it.

20:25.195 --> 20:27.229
Oh...

20:32.235 --> 20:36.038
Help me! Help me!

20:36.072 --> 20:39.907
You cannot save
someone in this place.

20:41.810 --> 20:44.979
You can only
replace them.

20:45.014 --> 20:48.382
Do you desire
this also?

20:48.417 --> 20:50.184
Yes. If that's
what it takes.

20:50.218 --> 20:54.589
No. You are
not for them.

20:55.857 --> 20:58.092
You are mine.

20:58.127 --> 21:00.628
Get off me!

21:08.837 --> 21:12.741
You want me willingly?
Then protect her.

21:15.412 --> 21:17.647
You will be
willing, in time...

21:22.086 --> 21:25.489
When you have lost your
taste for ultimatums.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.568
Help me.

21:39.303 --> 21:40.303
Do it.

21:44.408 --> 21:47.343
<i>Make your father proud.</i>

22:01.792 --> 22:05.195
I knew it, I fucking
knew it. Coward.

22:19.110 --> 22:21.144
Well, where the fuck do
you think you're going?

22:21.178 --> 22:24.046
To the camp.
He needs help.

22:25.382 --> 22:27.149
Get in.

22:36.326 --> 22:37.626
Subin!

22:43.032 --> 22:44.934
Fuck!

22:48.605 --> 22:50.974
Ahhh! Fuck!

22:53.044 --> 22:54.777
Fuck.

23:15.766 --> 23:17.066
Clare.

23:19.637 --> 23:24.041
Where are my weapons? Is this
all you have brought me?

23:24.076 --> 23:25.343
One soldier?

23:25.377 --> 23:27.712
Let her go.

23:27.747 --> 23:30.215
But she wishes to remain.

23:30.249 --> 23:33.558
She has chosen to stay
here. Is that not so?

23:34.253 --> 23:35.887
Please. Don't hurt her.

23:35.921 --> 23:38.906
You must go, now. My
men will soon return.

23:38.931 --> 23:39.923
And they are many.

23:39.924 --> 23:41.669
I told you. I can get
you those weapons.

23:41.694 --> 23:42.894
Anything you need...

23:43.862 --> 23:48.265
And still,
you do not hear.

23:51.536 --> 23:54.305
- Say goodbye to your daughter.
- No!

23:58.477 --> 24:00.678
Clare, it's okay,
you're safe.

24:02.781 --> 24:04.515
Najim!

24:06.151 --> 24:07.852
Najim!

24:09.422 --> 24:13.525
Najim, it's okay!

24:22.433 --> 24:24.501
Najim!

24:24.535 --> 24:26.240
Clare, we have to go.
Come here to me!

24:26.241 --> 24:27.135
Najim, come here!

24:27.160 --> 24:28.571
If he doesn't want to come
with us, that's his problem.

24:28.572 --> 24:30.073
No, I'm not leaving him.

24:30.107 --> 24:33.009
Janjaweed. They are coming.

24:33.044 --> 24:36.747
Move. Move, now.
Crawford! Get in!

24:36.781 --> 24:38.416
Crawford,
drive. Kill the lights!

24:38.450 --> 24:39.851
They are coming!
Quick, it's okay!

24:39.885 --> 24:41.700
No, he saved my life.
I can't leave him. Najim!

24:41.725 --> 24:42.925
Move, move! Go. Go.

24:43.422 --> 24:46.591
Wait! No, wait. He's coming.
He's coming. Stop the car.

24:46.626 --> 24:48.827
Najim!
Come on, Son. Come on.

24:48.861 --> 24:52.064
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Come on.

25:59.334 --> 26:01.235
It's not my usual fantasy.

26:01.270 --> 26:03.471
Usually, you're wearing
latex and a strap-on.

26:03.505 --> 26:06.307
Well, I see the bullet hasn't
improved your sense of humor, then.

26:06.341 --> 26:10.578
And Stonebridge? You found his
corpse yet or you're still looking?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.180
We don't know that
he's dead yet.

26:12.214 --> 26:14.250
He's been
looking for that bullet

26:14.275 --> 26:15.749
ever since Kate died.

26:16.885 --> 26:20.388
And, you knew that.
You fucking used it.

26:20.422 --> 26:22.216
You knew he'd go the
whole nine to rescue

26:22.241 --> 26:23.717
some damsel in distress.

26:25.427 --> 26:27.529
Too bad your perfect
plan fucked up, huh?

26:27.563 --> 26:29.664
I liked him too, Scott.
Yeah.

26:29.698 --> 26:32.133
But, unfortunately, I can only
rescue you at the moment.

26:32.168 --> 26:34.402
Lucky me...

26:34.436 --> 26:35.971
Bitch.

26:53.855 --> 26:57.390
Nothing. I think
we're good.

26:57.424 --> 26:59.592
They're just chasing blind.

26:59.626 --> 27:03.095
For now. But we're still
gonna have to keep moving.

27:04.764 --> 27:06.798
You can still have that
morphine shot if you want it.

27:06.832 --> 27:08.232
That's all right.

27:08.267 --> 27:10.935
It's okay, I won't think
you're any less macho.

27:10.969 --> 27:13.238
Someone else might
need it more later.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.306
Hmm. That's
reassuring. Thanks.

27:22.313 --> 27:25.147
You know, I hope what he's
paying you feels worth it.

27:26.616 --> 27:29.685
I don't work for him. I work
for the British government.

27:31.021 --> 27:32.422
He's my prisoner.

27:34.726 --> 27:38.061
I've been arrested for
trafficking arms...

27:38.096 --> 27:40.263
Weapons I was
sending to save you.

27:42.033 --> 27:43.834
So, I...struck
a new deal.

27:44.802 --> 27:46.436
We help get you out...

27:46.471 --> 27:49.173
And he gives us valuable
information about a terrorist.

27:53.544 --> 27:55.646
Which he knows about how?

27:58.950 --> 28:02.487
And you expect
me to be grateful?

28:14.200 --> 28:16.536
Well, at least you
got your money back.

28:17.371 --> 28:19.305
That's something, eh?

28:21.209 --> 28:22.910
<i>Colonel.</i>

28:22.945 --> 28:27.115
We're picking up smoke trails at
the water hole at Bir an Natrun.

28:27.149 --> 28:30.351
The heat map indicates
some sort of explosion.

28:30.419 --> 28:32.900
<i>If Stonebridge has managed to</i>
<i>engage the Janjaweed,</i>

28:32.925 --> 28:34.784
<i>then this would fit that scenario.</i>

28:35.024 --> 28:36.858
All right, send through the image.

28:38.294 --> 28:40.295
Julia thinks that lunatic
might still be alive.

28:40.329 --> 28:42.431
Really?

28:42.465 --> 28:44.833
Probably nothing, it's
an oil burn or a blip...

28:44.867 --> 28:47.202
Oh. Uh...
Let me see.

28:48.104 --> 28:49.771
That's not nothing.

28:49.805 --> 28:52.640
Send a chopper, take
a closer look. Oh...

28:52.674 --> 28:54.842
Unfortunately, I don't
have the resources.

28:54.877 --> 28:57.011
What?

28:57.045 --> 28:59.546
This operation was not
officially sanctioned.

29:00.315 --> 29:01.581
Excuse me?

29:01.616 --> 29:04.384
London vetoed the mission.

29:04.418 --> 29:06.987
They still think Crawford
is in custody in Kenya...

29:07.021 --> 29:10.023
Which is where he would be, if
everything had gone to plan.

29:10.057 --> 29:12.458
Oh...
I took a calculated risk.

29:12.492 --> 29:15.561
- Fuck that. Fuck you.
- We need the information on Latif.

29:15.596 --> 29:18.464
Yeah, yeah. In
Latex, I know.

29:18.498 --> 29:21.000
Should we save the
recriminations till later?

29:22.069 --> 29:24.037
Let's get you to safety.

29:24.071 --> 29:29.108
Wait. In Dieter's file, it said
that he was a chopper pilot.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.310
It's a long shot, but they might
have had a bird out here...

29:31.344 --> 29:34.780
To extract Clare and
Crawford after the exchange.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.715
How unfortunate that
you killed him, then.

29:36.749 --> 29:41.586
Is it worth
a hand job, if I didn't?

30:03.275 --> 30:04.676
Hello, Dieter.

30:04.710 --> 30:06.711
I'm Colonel Grant, British
Military Intelligence.

30:06.745 --> 30:08.913
Don't move, please, don't move.

30:08.947 --> 30:11.850
If I push this, an air bubble will go
into your heart and kill you...

30:11.884 --> 30:14.052
It's a very
nasty way to go.

30:14.087 --> 30:15.854
It's just Insurance.

30:15.889 --> 30:17.523
You weren't going to
kill my men after all.

30:17.557 --> 30:20.760
No. We weren't, we...
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

30:20.795 --> 30:23.797
Now I can
choose not to kill you.

30:23.832 --> 30:26.267
So, shall we discuss where
your transport is?

30:26.835 --> 30:27.969
Uh...

30:42.149 --> 30:44.349
How many people have you
killed, rescuing me?

30:46.319 --> 30:47.819
I don't know.

30:49.322 --> 30:51.623
Less than I'll save, if
I get that information.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.493
That doesn't
make it right.

30:55.461 --> 30:56.461
It's still playing God.

30:56.496 --> 30:58.397
Mmm... It's a doctor's
prerogative, is it?

30:58.431 --> 30:59.565
Don't preach to me.

30:59.599 --> 31:03.736
No, I'm
not. I'm sorry.

31:10.411 --> 31:16.918
I've spent my whole life trying to
prove I was different from him.

31:16.953 --> 31:19.387
Only to realize that
I'm just the same.

31:23.892 --> 31:25.693
I've killed people.

31:28.964 --> 31:31.098
I killed my own fiance.

31:33.568 --> 31:35.069
That wasn't your fault.

31:36.738 --> 31:43.445
It was my fault. It was my
fault that we were abducted.

31:43.479 --> 31:46.642
He hated the camps.
He hated the danger,

31:46.667 --> 31:48.277
and I made him stay.

31:48.885 --> 31:51.100
Because I wanted to
save that boy's mother.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.325
But, I didn't save her.

31:55.158 --> 31:56.992
She died anyway.

32:02.465 --> 32:04.600
So, they'd blame you
too, would they?

32:06.446 --> 32:08.160
They're dead now, and you'll
never forgive yourself

32:08.185 --> 32:09.385
because neither would they?

32:09.672 --> 32:13.542
They
deserved to live.

32:15.078 --> 32:17.579
Clare, have you ever
saved anyone that didn't?

33:06.161 --> 33:09.965
Ugh. Fuck.

33:09.999 --> 33:13.168
Fuck me. Ugh...fuck.

33:13.203 --> 33:15.437
Somebody get
this fuck off me!

33:22.545 --> 33:24.546
Where's Hendricks?

33:24.580 --> 33:26.814
Hendricks is in a hospital, Andre
and the others are dead.

33:26.849 --> 33:28.683
So let's not
fuck up anymore!

33:28.717 --> 33:29.951
And who are you?

33:29.985 --> 33:33.220
I'm Mr.
Crawford's CEO.

33:33.255 --> 33:35.489
Codeword for this, is
Scylla and Charybdis.

33:35.557 --> 33:38.025
Now, move it soldier, we've
got a package to collect.

34:45.099 --> 34:47.467
Crawford, wake up.

34:53.106 --> 34:54.274
Look.

34:59.248 --> 35:01.649
Government troops.
Army checkpoint.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.218
Well, that's
good, isn't it?

35:04.252 --> 35:07.421
I'll name drop Matak, we'll get
an escort back to Khartoum.

35:07.455 --> 35:10.757
Uh... I don't know.
What?

35:10.792 --> 35:12.226
What are they
doing out here?

35:12.260 --> 35:13.518
Well, patrolling? Who cares?

35:13.543 --> 35:15.276
Maybe Matak has
them looking for us...

35:15.664 --> 35:17.064
Christ knows
I've paid him enough.

35:17.098 --> 35:19.099
Matak set you up
before, remember.

35:19.134 --> 35:21.035
And your men tried to
kill him at the exchange.

35:21.069 --> 35:23.538
Maybe he just wants
to return the favor?

35:23.572 --> 35:25.573
I say we find a different
route, just to be safe.

35:25.607 --> 35:29.343
What's he saying?

35:29.378 --> 35:31.412
Janjaweed. Two
jeeps. Coming fast.

35:31.446 --> 35:32.526
If we press on, we
hit that checkpoint.

35:32.712 --> 35:34.346
If the soldiers are friendly
we'll have more fire power

35:34.371 --> 35:35.449
against the Janjaweed.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.372
Crawford, you
drive, take it slow, but get

35:37.397 --> 35:38.597
ready to gun it on command.

35:38.787 --> 35:40.354
What's going on?
What are you doing?

35:40.389 --> 35:42.657
It's a checkpoint, get your head down,
we might need to blast through.

35:42.691 --> 35:45.726
No. No more guns.
Clare, just keep low.

35:45.761 --> 35:48.529
Crawford. Latif's spy.
What's his name?

35:50.031 --> 35:52.199
Oh, Clare's safe
now, is she?

35:56.003 --> 36:00.773
What...
Jacoub.

36:00.808 --> 36:03.609
Stay down.

36:12.651 --> 36:14.361
<i>Jacoub, put your weapon</i>

36:14.386 --> 36:15.737
<i>down. Put your weapon down.</i>

36:18.390 --> 36:19.568
Oh, for Christ's sake...

36:19.569 --> 36:21.818
No, no that's good, it'll
frighten the life out of them,

36:21.843 --> 36:22.861
if they hear us all singing.

36:22.862 --> 36:24.662
Everyone, sing. Nice
and loud. Come on!

36:35.275 --> 36:37.710
Good, Go. Go, go!

37:05.272 --> 37:06.297
They wanted us dead.

37:06.322 --> 37:08.281
They weren't fucking
government forces!

37:08.574 --> 37:11.109
I told you, Matak
had us marked.

37:11.143 --> 37:13.445
Najim, outstanding, back
of the net with that one.

37:13.479 --> 37:16.081
Oh, we're celebrating
killing people, are we?

37:16.115 --> 37:19.051
Is everyone all
right? Dad? Najim?

37:19.085 --> 37:20.184
You all right?

37:20.209 --> 37:22.644
Yeah, he's good.
We're all fine.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.096
Except me...

37:31.533 --> 37:32.733
I've been shot.

37:40.709 --> 37:42.509
Dad...

37:45.580 --> 37:47.180
- He's been hit.
- No his back, his back.

37:47.215 --> 37:49.382
Ugh, get him
higher. Get him higher.

37:49.417 --> 37:52.051
Jacoub get the fuck out of here.

37:52.987 --> 37:54.854
All right, Dad?

37:54.889 --> 37:56.179
It's all right, Dad.
Just, just relax for

37:56.204 --> 37:57.817
me Dad, okay? I'm here.

38:07.101 --> 38:10.170
It feels wet. Wet,
like I'm drowning...

38:10.204 --> 38:12.538
I know, just relax.

38:12.573 --> 38:16.042
I can's feel an
exit wound. Shit.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.712
Crawford, I need you to give me
the name of Latif's spy.

38:18.746 --> 38:21.281
You saved your daughter's life.
You have her, now tell me his name.

38:21.315 --> 38:22.782
Are you interrogating him?
Yes, I am!

38:22.816 --> 38:24.183
Don't you dare!
He's dying!

38:24.218 --> 38:25.918
He's got blood in his lungs
and they're filling up...

38:25.952 --> 38:27.687
And there's fuck all in here
that I can use to stop it!

38:27.721 --> 38:29.588
I can still hear all this.

38:29.622 --> 38:31.824
Okay, Dad, just relax.
Just keep calm.

38:32.892 --> 38:36.362
Fine, Clare!
What do you need?

38:36.396 --> 38:38.330
Okay...
I need something sharp...

38:38.364 --> 38:40.247
To stab into his chest,
to release the pressure.

38:40.272 --> 38:41.133
That's right. I have a knife.

38:41.134 --> 38:43.936
That's no good. A
valve... I need a valve.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.571
Got a pen. In
my back pocket.

38:45.605 --> 38:47.139
Yes, a pen!
A pen will work!

38:47.173 --> 38:49.108
Here... Okay?

38:49.142 --> 38:51.001
Yes, perfect. Um, take
that part out of it, and

38:51.026 --> 38:52.211
then slice off the end.

38:52.212 --> 38:53.436
All right, Dad, just keep
breathing for me.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.661
That's right. I've got you.

38:54.948 --> 38:56.782
I've got you.
Are you good?

38:56.816 --> 38:58.317
All right.
All right.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.827
Keep breathing for me, all right?
They're gaining!

39:07.895 --> 39:10.763
Najim, here, here!
Same as last time!

39:16.904 --> 39:19.238
Here. Stick it in here, between
the first and second rib.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.074
No, you do it.
You're the surgeon.

39:21.108 --> 39:23.710
Oh!

39:25.046 --> 39:26.613
Oh, fuck, I can't!

39:26.647 --> 39:28.315
He's my Dad. Please?

39:28.349 --> 39:30.617
Okay, here? First and
second rib, here?

39:30.651 --> 39:31.785
Uh-huh.

39:33.354 --> 39:34.754
- Fuck.
- That's it.

39:34.788 --> 39:36.522
That's the air coming out, right?
Come on, Dad...

39:36.557 --> 39:38.024
Yes.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.694
Jacoub? Why are
we slowing down?

39:40.728 --> 39:42.629
I don't know. The gas.
Pull over.

39:42.663 --> 39:44.331
It must've been hit at the checkpoint.
Pull over by that tree...

39:44.365 --> 39:46.500
- Pull up to that side and pull over.
- Okay.

39:47.735 --> 39:50.571
That's good.

39:55.577 --> 39:57.011
Just keep looking
into my eyes, dad.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.847
It's okay. No!
Clare?

39:58.881 --> 40:00.048
- Come on, Jacoub!
- Don't close your eyes!

40:09.426 --> 40:11.594
- I need you to stay here and cover me.
- Okay!

40:11.629 --> 40:13.363
I'm gonna draw the fire.

40:13.397 --> 40:15.265
What the fuck?
Why aren't you dead?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.006
Go, go!

40:35.920 --> 40:38.588
Dad, it's working, dad.

40:38.655 --> 40:39.755
I'm sorry.

40:40.957 --> 40:42.491
I'm so sorry.

41:07.518 --> 41:10.787
Clare?
Dad?

41:10.821 --> 41:13.457
It's no good.
He needs a name.

41:13.491 --> 41:16.193
Just don't
die on me now.

41:16.895 --> 41:18.162
I'm sorry.

41:38.415 --> 41:40.750
Dad? Dad?

41:46.856 --> 41:48.924
No ammo! I'm out of ammo!

41:48.958 --> 41:52.127
The car! More in
the car, Jacoub!

41:55.165 --> 41:56.732
I'll cover you!

42:04.107 --> 42:06.475
Stay down behind
the front of the car!

42:27.895 --> 42:29.195
Where the fuck is he?

42:33.768 --> 42:37.671
Hey Allah!
I will never die!

42:38.806 --> 42:41.208
You can't kill me.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.393
Fuck.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.877
I'm sorry too.

43:49.411 --> 43:51.145
Clare?

43:52.914 --> 43:54.281
Come on.

44:09.629 --> 44:13.265
Clare! Clare, come
with me! Keep your head down!

44:13.299 --> 44:16.301
Get in. Tell me
you've got it.

44:16.335 --> 44:18.804
He gave her the name of
the spy, before he died.

44:18.838 --> 44:20.305
Be right back.

44:30.216 --> 44:31.672
- So, you got your car then. 
- Yes.

44:31.697 --> 44:32.751
And your money.

44:32.752 --> 44:35.287
Thank you. And you are sure
no one will come and look for it?

44:35.322 --> 44:37.657
No. You've earned
it. It's yours.

44:37.692 --> 44:40.828
We are business partners, now.
"Jacoub and Sons."

44:42.797 --> 44:45.399
I will beat you
for your rudeness.

44:47.470 --> 44:49.838
<i>As-Salamu.</i>

44:49.872 --> 44:53.442
<i>As-Salamu.</i> Now, go.
<i>As-Salamu.</i>

45:35.517 --> 45:39.687
Wanna put away the Pulitzer
for a minute? Come back here.

45:39.722 --> 45:42.991
Doctor's orders, Sweetie.
Can't get you too excited.

45:43.025 --> 45:47.296
Promise... I'll make
it worth your while. Huh?

45:51.034 --> 45:54.102
Oh!

45:55.772 --> 45:59.140
What's the matter, Sweetie?

45:59.208 --> 46:00.541
Wow.
