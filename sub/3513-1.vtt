WEBVTT

01:27.320 --> 01:29.231
Hank, what are you doing?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.133
Testing out the new equipment

01:31.191 --> 01:33.535
and getting a picture of you while
you're still young and innocent.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.130
Oh, well, I am getting married once,
not four times.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.369
Oh, you're a
"happily ever after" guy?

01:38.431 --> 01:40.274
Yeah.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.739
Detective, what are you looking at?
You just bought a ring.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.407
That's not what I'm looking at.

01:45.472 --> 01:46.542
Come on, don't ruin it for me.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.815
Now, she wears Armani,
makes low six figures, drives a BMW

01:49.876 --> 01:52.948
and is falling for a senior
partner at her law firm.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.013
Nothing but trouble, Hank.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.684
Why can't you just look at
her ass like the rest of us?

01:55.748 --> 01:56.818
I can't.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.419
Come on, Nick, we have a call.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.069
The hiker flagged me down.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.945
He came through the ravine,
said he saw something pretty bad.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.975
I didn't know what he was talking about,
until he showed me this.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.694
The rest of her is off trail.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.068
How do you know it's a "her"?

02:43.129 --> 02:44.130
Because of this.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.069
Woman's Nike.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.943
What kind of animal could do this?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.449
Normally, we'd be able to tell by
the tracks, a bear, cougar, wolf...

02:52.505 --> 02:53.779
Well, which one is it?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.844
That's where this gets interesting.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.514
This is the only track we found.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.320
Hey, we got a boot print down here.
We're going to need a cast.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.587
Right away.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.323
DNA will tell us if this
is your case or ours.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.162
This sounds like what happened a
month ago at Manson Creek Falls.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.963
Same deal. Hiker and a bobcat.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.437
But the bobcat
wasn't wearing boots.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.734
Do you hear something?

03:15.795 --> 03:17.069
What?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.302
Music.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.817
Hank, we got an iPod over here.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.081
What's the song?

03:30.143 --> 03:31.520
Sweet Dreams.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.457
Arrhythmic. One of their better.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.516
Sweet dreams are made of these

03:36.616 --> 03:38.425
Who am I to disagree

03:38.484 --> 03:39.792
I didn't know you couldn't sing.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.969
Until we get the DNA results,
I'll run a database on violent predators

03:49.028 --> 03:50.029
in the area.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.076
We better search beyond the metro.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.804
Absolutely.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.642
We should also take another look
at that Manson Creek Falls attack.

03:56.703 --> 04:01.049
You'll be busy. I'll take the iPod
down for prints. Be back in a minute.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.455
Whoa!

04:10.383 --> 04:13.091
Sorry, Nick, guess I should
have worn my airbag today.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.534
We've got 23 known predators within
five square miles of the crime scene.

05:25.591 --> 05:29.596
None of them rise to the kind of
violence we saw out there this morning.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.437
Just got a hit on a missing person.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.637
University student went out jogging
this morning and never came back.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.810
She left at 7:30 this morning
and I'm a little freaked out

05:41.874 --> 05:43.751
because she's always back by 8:30.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.221
Do you have a photo of her?

05:45.278 --> 05:46.348
On my iPhone.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.449
Do you know what kind of
running shoes she was wearing?

05:48.514 --> 05:49.925
Uh, pink Nike.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.000
Hard to believe that's the
girl we saw this morning.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.968
Sylvie Ester. Positive ID.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.030
Well, at least we know who she is.
Man, what a way to go.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.939
Just hope it happened fast.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.499
Man, let's get the
hell out of here.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.204
Yeah. It's been a long day.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.816
Big night. Don't blow it, Romeo.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.452
Juliette?

07:05.825 --> 07:09.238
Aunt Marie, when did you get here?

07:09.295 --> 07:11.297
Hey, she was here when I got home.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.536
Sorry for the short notice.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.770
What, you didn't
know she was coming?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.710
I meant to call.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.578
Sometimes I mean to do something
and I assume I usually have.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.174
Well, how are you doing?
ls everything okay?

07:20.239 --> 07:22.310
Not as okay as I used to be.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.083
She was telling me some pretty funny
stories about when you were little.

07:25.144 --> 07:26.987
Dead frog in the microwave?

07:27.046 --> 07:28.491
Among others.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.027
Come and give us a hug.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.597
We need to talk.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.399
How bad is it?

07:42.495 --> 07:45.101
Two months, two weeks, two days.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.871
Nobody knows.

07:46.933 --> 07:50.039
But there are so many
things I have to tell you.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.740
Why didn't you come here sooner?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.215
I couldn't.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.512
Why?

07:55.775 --> 07:59.655
Just listen to me,
there are things you don't know,

08:00.446 --> 08:02.153
things about your family.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.889
My family? You're my family.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.057
Have you been seeing
strange things?

08:08.855 --> 08:10.528
Things that you can't explain?

08:14.193 --> 08:16.036
Oh, I knew it.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.133
This is all happening so much
faster than I thought it would.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.871
When it happened to me,
it knocked me on my ass.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.378
I couldn't move for a week.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.778
What are you talking about?

08:23.836 --> 08:27.079
The misfortune of our family
is already passing to you.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.780
I'm so sorry.
I know you love Juliette,

08:31.577 --> 08:34.183
but you have to end it
and never see her again.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.817
It's just too dangerous.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.717
What?

08:41.554 --> 08:44.797
Oh, my God, he's here.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.361
Who?

08:47.860 --> 08:48.861
Hilda.

09:56.662 --> 09:57.834
Did you kill him?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.137
Yes.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.438
I thought I lost him.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.610
They're after me.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.744
Never lose this.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.317
Guard it with your life.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.084
They'll be looking for it.

10:13.713 --> 10:14.714
Nick,

10:16.682 --> 10:18.593
your parents didn't die in a crash.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.660
They were killed.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.192
What?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.346
I didn't see what happened.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.474
I just heard gunshots
and called 911.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.178
It happened so fast.
He came out of nowhere.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.050
He had that thing in his hand.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.557
He went right for her, Hank.
I had no choice.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.718
Take it easy.
You go to the hospital.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.022
I'll handle this.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.087
She said she knew him.
That his name was Hilda.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.395
I'll run his prints.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.627
Do you want me to come with you?

11:00.059 --> 11:03.040
No, I'll be home as soon as I can.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.631
Okay. Love you.

11:20.746 --> 11:24.216
Mr. Burkhardt? She's conscious now.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.140
You saw him didn't you?

11:39.665 --> 11:41.474
You saw who Hilda really was.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.845
I don't know what I saw,
or how you did that.

11:44.904 --> 11:45.974
What's going on?

11:46.038 --> 11:49.247
We have the ability to
see what no one else can.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.486
When they lose control,
they can't hide

11:52.545 --> 11:54.752
and we see them for
what they really are.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.426
Look, you need some rest.

11:57.483 --> 12:01.158
This is no fairytale.
The stories are real.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.594
What they wrote about
really happened.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.104
You are one of the last Grimm.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.300
I know it's a lot.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.310
And I wish I had more time,
but everything's in my trailer.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.539
Sweetie, there's so much
you still don't know.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.715
Look, what you said
about my parents...

12:20.005 --> 12:23.145
You're vulnerable now.
You need to be careful.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.551
Don't ever lose what I gave to you.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.523
I'm sorry, Mr. Burkhardt,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.892
you can see her again tomorrow.

13:15.661 --> 13:19.234
Hey, Nick. You get that translated?

13:20.499 --> 13:24.948
Yeah. It means
Reapers of the Grimm.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.611
That fits your buddy, Hilda.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.145
Wait till you hear
what I got on him.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.058
Hilda was from Boise, Idaho,
where he worked as an accountant,

13:35.114 --> 13:37.822
but his prints came back as a Mr.
London from Chicago,

13:37.883 --> 13:39.863
wanted for assault,
rape and murder.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.298
There's also warrants matching those
prints in Florida and Alabama.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.091
He was wanted for assault,
rape and murder?

13:46.158 --> 13:49.002
Don't let the comb-overthrow you.
This was a bad guy.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.564
Hey, Nick,
Captain wants to see you.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.066
What's he want?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.245
Guess you'll find out.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.479
If you had to shoot somebody,
you sure picked the right guy.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.949
How you doing? You holding up?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.421
Yes, sir.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.480
First shooting is no small thing.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.426
You'll be required to see
the police psychologist.

14:11.483 --> 14:12.757
Yes, sir.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.999
Make sure you do.
And get some rest.

16:18.277 --> 16:19.415
How long have you been down here?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.485
I couldn't sleep.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.317
What is all this?

16:23.382 --> 16:24.986
I don't know.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.087
I'll deal with it later.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.695
Sorry. Let's go back to bed.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.068
How long did you live with Marie?

16:37.129 --> 16:38.904
She was my mother from
the time I was 12.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.307
After your parents died?

16:40.366 --> 16:41.504
Yeah.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.843
You didn't live in
that trailer, did you?

16:43.902 --> 16:45.506
I didn't know she had it.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.181
I think it was just a cat.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.019
Yeah.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.838
This is what we're looking for.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.901
If this is an exact match
of the boot prints,

17:15.968 --> 17:18.710
it's going to be
very helpful. Thanks.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.215
Take a look at the lab reports.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.252
DNA of the attacker
is inconclusive.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.116
Still don't know if we're
looking for a man or a beast.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.746
Well, we got a lead
if it wears boots.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.724
Based on the plaster casts,
this is the boot we're looking for.

17:59.178 --> 18:03.183
She's in a deep coma. There was a
sudden spike in the EKG this morning,

18:03.248 --> 18:06.161
but I don't have anything
definitive to tell you yet.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.956
Will she come out of this?

18:09.021 --> 18:11.092
Well, all we can do is wait.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.396
Did you know about the scars?

18:14.526 --> 18:15.630
What scars?

18:15.694 --> 18:17.901
A lot of them look
like knife wounds.

18:17.963 --> 18:21.911
They're all over her body.
What line of work was she in?

18:23.502 --> 18:24.606
She was a librarian.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.710
Yeah?

18:30.142 --> 18:31.382
On my Way-

18:40.819 --> 18:42.799
I don't understand.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.062
She was supposed to go
straight there from school.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.367
She never showed up. I looked all over
the neighborhood, then I came right here.

18:48.427 --> 18:49.428
Will you take care of them, please?

18:49.495 --> 18:50.496
Yeah, I got it.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.800
What do we know?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.746
Little girl on the way to her
grandfather's house, never showed up.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.339
That's him. The guy with the beard.

18:59.404 --> 19:00.439
Do we know he's clean?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.179
No. We're looking into that.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.080
This is the best photo they had.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.153
We don't know what we got here.
Relative, ransom or pedophile

19:10.215 --> 19:11.694
and the clock is ticking.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.788
We split into teams, section off the
path she would have taken from school.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.896
It's a mile and a half from
the school to the house.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.530
When last seen, she was wearing
purple leggings and a red sweatshirt.

19:22.594 --> 19:25.006
Make sure you have a copy
of the photo and the map.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.566
You all know your section so
let's get out there and find her.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.984
Captain. Yeah?

19:35.040 --> 19:38.385
When the university student was attacked,
she was wearing a red sweatshirt.

19:38.443 --> 19:39.820
The girl who was torn to pieces?

19:39.878 --> 19:40.879
Yeah.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.258
Well, let's hope it's
not the same guy.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.397
She's supposed to cross
Hunter Lane right there

19:55.460 --> 19:57.599
and then go around the
park to Hildebrand.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.870
The old man's house is on the
other side of the park, right?

19:59.932 --> 20:03.641
Right. 4753 Hildebrand Road,
directly across from here.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.182
When I was a kid, I wouldn't have
gone all the way around the park.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.149
Well, her mother was very
specific about the route.

20:08.941 --> 20:12.718
Yeah, right. Kids always do what their
moms tell them to do. I know I did.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.914
Come on, Nick.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.904
I'll take this trail.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.740
You need to be careful.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.220
You're vulnerable now.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.988
This isn't a fairytale.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.863
Nick, I got something here!

21:12.204 --> 21:13.205
Robin Howell.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.010
She must have been grabbed
somewhere in this area.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.917
Be careful where you step.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.022
We got a crime scene in Berkeley Park.
Yeah, off Hildebrand.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.360
Hank, we got boot prints
over here, same kind!

21:25.417 --> 21:26.589
He took her this way!

22:00.686 --> 22:02.393
Hank, I got him!

22:13.098 --> 22:15.510
Where is she? Where is she?

22:27.879 --> 22:30.018
Look, I know she's
in here somewhere.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.220
If you got another place to look,
we'll look.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.922
But we've torn this place apart.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.291
What are we doing here?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.565
If she's not in there,
he's got her someplace else.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.833
What do you see in
this guy we don't?

22:44.763 --> 22:46.868
He's got no priors. He's clean.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.435
He fits the profile. He's a loner,
he's never been married,

22:49.501 --> 22:50.878
he lives across the
street from the park.

22:50.936 --> 22:54.509
That's not going to get him into
a court unless he sues our ass.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.339
You shouldn't have come back!

25:00.031 --> 25:03.137
Okay, okay, okay, lighten up,
I'm just making a point.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.876
Come on. Let's grab a brew.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.145
And by the way,
you're paying for that window.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.882
You know I've never
seen one of you before.

25:16.948 --> 25:21.226
I heard about you guys all my life.
Never thought I'd see one up close.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.600
A Grimm. What do you know?

25:25.857 --> 25:26.858
You know about me?

25:26.925 --> 25:28.268
Are you kidding?

25:28.326 --> 25:30.567
My folks used to tell me
stories about you guys.

25:30.629 --> 25:33.109
Scared the hell out of
me when I was a kid.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.742
How long you been at this?
You seem kind of new.

25:36.768 --> 25:37.803
Who are you?

25:37.869 --> 25:41.214
Wow, you are new at this.
What? Someone in your family just die?

25:41.273 --> 25:43.184
My aunt's in a coma.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.811
Ah, that explains it.

25:45.443 --> 25:46.444
What's her name?

25:46.845 --> 25:47.846
Marie Keeler.

25:49.447 --> 25:52.519
Oh, yeah, I heard of her.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.524
Look, I don't want any
more trouble, okay?

25:55.587 --> 25:59.399
I'm not that kind of Bluebeard.
I don't kill anymore. I haven't in years.

25:59.457 --> 26:01.562
Wait, what did you say you were?

26:01.626 --> 26:02.866
Bluebeard.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.202
Vulgarized by your ancestors
as the big bad wolf.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.641
What, did you just get
the books tonight?

26:07.699 --> 26:09.542
You know about the books.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.638
Of course I know about the books.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.182
We all know about the books.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.811
You people started profiling
us over 200 years ago.

26:17.275 --> 26:20.552
But as you can see
I am not that big,

26:20.612 --> 26:22.387
and I am done with the bad thing.

26:22.447 --> 26:24.723
Well, how do you...
How do I stay good?

26:24.783 --> 26:27.889
Through a strict regimen of diet,
drugs and Pilates.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.762
I'm a reformed Bluebeard.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.324
A Wieder Bluebeard.
It's a different church altogether.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.994
Wait, you guys go to church?

26:34.059 --> 26:36.665
Sure. Don't you?

26:41.600 --> 26:45.241
Then what she said is
really happening to me.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.078
I have to stop it.
How do I stop it?

26:47.138 --> 26:49.140
"Stop it?" You can't stop it.

26:50.809 --> 26:51.810
It's who you are.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.987
So if you just got into this, you must
be seeing some pretty strange things.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.629
Yeah, I am.

27:01.686 --> 27:03.359
I guess that's why you're here.

27:03.421 --> 27:06.129
No, I'm here because
of the little girl.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.693
Still haven't found her yet?

27:07.759 --> 27:09.796
No, we haven't.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.431
Ah! Look at this.

27:11.496 --> 27:12.634
You know where she is.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.335
Of course, I don't
know where she is.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.073
Did I not just tell you
about my strict regimen?

27:17.569 --> 27:20.846
So, how many of you
Bluebirds are there?

27:20.939 --> 27:23.749
First off,
the plural is Balustrade.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.316
And I don't know.
We don't socialize much.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.792
Bad things happen when we get into a pack,
especially when we see red.

27:30.849 --> 27:33.261
So all those things
I've been seeing...

27:33.318 --> 27:34.422
We're not things.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.788
Look, I'm a clockmaker
for God's sake.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.766
I don't go around
abducting little girls.

27:39.758 --> 27:42.705
Okay, then tonight, in the backyard,
you were marking your territory.

27:42.794 --> 27:45.172
I wasn't pissing on
my fence for kicks.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.234
Then there are more
of you around here.

27:48.299 --> 27:51.371
Look, you may not
know where she is.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.609
But you've got a pretty
good idea who's got her.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.050
I don't bother the other Balustrade,
they don't bother me.

27:56.107 --> 27:59.554
Well, guess what, pal,
I'm not a Balustrade, I'm a cop,

27:59.611 --> 28:02.785
and if you know who's got her,
you had better tell me right now.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.121
Please don't threaten me.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.059
I want to know who's got her.

29:20.191 --> 29:22.330
Don't be afraid.

29:23.828 --> 29:25.205
Do you like it?

29:25.764 --> 29:26.834
It's all yours.

29:27.298 --> 29:28.868
I just want to go home.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.241
You are home.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.209
What do you say we hang this up?

30:03.001 --> 30:04.708
Do you want a chicken pot pie?

30:30.595 --> 30:32.131
I really think I should drive.

30:32.197 --> 30:33.801
No, I'm good.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.368
If this is the same Bluebeard that
killed that woman in the woods...

30:36.434 --> 30:39.210
Well, assuming he fed yesterday,
he'll be good for a week,

30:39.270 --> 30:41.181
maybe 10 days, tops.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.879
He'll just use the
time to fatten her up.

30:44.309 --> 30:45.481
Oh!

30:45.543 --> 30:48.353
I got a hit. We're close.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.652
Did you really smell him?

30:49.714 --> 30:52.251
Dude, you have no idea.

31:16.241 --> 31:19.950
Okay, this is as far as we drive.

31:27.785 --> 31:28.855
He's over there?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.900
Oh, he's real close.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.233
What's that? Wolfs bane.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.703
So he won't scent us.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.761
You're kidding me, right?

31:36.828 --> 31:38.865
Not if you want to stay alive.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.236
What are you doing?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.307
You said he was over there.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.144
Why don't you just call him,
tell him you're coming? This way.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.961
Isn't this what the bridge is for?

32:17.135 --> 32:18.307
Sorry.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.042
Do I need something
like silver bullets?

32:22.073 --> 32:23.484
What are you, an idiot?

32:31.916 --> 32:32.951
That's his place.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.229
What's happening?

32:45.430 --> 32:48.274
I can't guarantee whatsit
happen if I go any closer.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.811
It's too dangerous.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.006
I might be on your side.
I might be on his side.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.117
I might even go after the girl.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.276
I'm sorry.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.878
But there's nothing more I can do.
I'm out of here.

33:11.389 --> 33:12.390
What?

33:12.457 --> 33:13.458
I found her.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.693
I want to go home.

33:42.787 --> 33:44.664
I told you, you are home!

33:54.465 --> 33:55.466
Where is he?

33:57.835 --> 34:00.076
He's in a house on the
other side of this stream.

34:00.171 --> 34:03.243
But you have to put
some of this on first.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.684
What the hell are you doing?

34:04.742 --> 34:06.016
So he doesn't smell us.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.885
We're not hunting deer.

34:07.945 --> 34:08.946
Where's backup?

34:10.281 --> 34:12.090
You're the only one I called. What?

34:12.150 --> 34:15.063
I already cried wolf once Do you
think they're going to believe me?

34:15.119 --> 34:16.188
Come on.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.730
How'd you find this place?

34:26.364 --> 34:28.344
Uh, the boots.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.607
I couldn't sleep,

34:30.668 --> 34:32.375
I started looking at addresses.
This is one of them.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.472
What's his name?

34:33.538 --> 34:34.539
Who?

34:34.605 --> 34:36.208
The guy we're looking for.

34:36.841 --> 34:37.842
Uh, I forgot.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.489
Oh. You do know there's
a bridge, right?

34:42.914 --> 34:43.915
Man!

34:45.683 --> 34:48.789
You better be right this time, buddy.
You saw his boot prints, right?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.924
Yeah. Over there by the house.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.058
Exact match?

34:52.123 --> 34:53.534
From what I could tell, yeah.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.331
You run his plates?

34:55.393 --> 34:56.735
I'm still waiting.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.374
What's the matter?
Do you not trust me?

35:01.065 --> 35:02.772
Okay. Let's do this.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.344
Good evening. Can I help you?

35:42.907 --> 35:46.946
Sorry to disturb you, sir. I'm Detective
Griffin. This is Detective Burkhardt.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.048
Do you have a few minutes?

35:49.113 --> 35:50.922
Of course. Would you
like to come in?

35:51.415 --> 35:52.416
That would be great.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.506
We can sit in here.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.742
Nice pillows.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.182
I did the needlepoint myself.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.285
Not that I tell everyone.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.083
Oh, pot pie's done.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.959
Just give me a moment.
And then we can talk, okay?

36:30.221 --> 36:31.256
Are you kidding me?

36:31.322 --> 36:33.928
Hank, I really believe
this is the right guy.

36:40.731 --> 36:41.869
Excuse me, sir.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.306
Sorry it's taking so long.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.750
But you know how
delicate crusts are.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.519
What kind of work do you do?

36:53.578 --> 36:56.058
I work for the government,
like you.

36:56.113 --> 36:57.751
I'm a postman.

36:57.815 --> 37:00.295
Not the most glamorous
job but I like it.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.564
Where were you between the
hours of 2:00 and 4:00 today?

37:03.621 --> 37:06.500
On my route. I'd like to
know what this is all about.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.896
This little girl
went missing today.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.133
That's awful.

37:11.195 --> 37:13.937
You don't think I had
anything do with this, do you?

37:13.998 --> 37:16.103
We have to run down
every possibility.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.169
What possibility could
have led you to me?

37:18.636 --> 37:20.172
We're looking for a pair of boots.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.908
Feel free to look
anywhere you want.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.389
If this guy had something to hide,
he would have kicked us out.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.486
Now I'm leaving.
I want to keep my job.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.097
Anything else?

37:47.265 --> 37:50.212
No. Thanks for your time
We'll see ourselves out.

37:57.808 --> 37:59.515
Hank, I'm sorry I really
thought this time...

37:59.577 --> 38:00.578
Wait.

38:02.546 --> 38:03.581
The song.

38:03.648 --> 38:04.820
What song?

38:04.882 --> 38:07.294
He was humming the same song.
The one on the dead girl's iPod.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.832
Hold it!

39:13.351 --> 39:17.060
Where is she? Where is she?

39:19.957 --> 39:20.958
Grimm.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.371
She's got to be in the house.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.778
Robin! Robin!

39:42.513 --> 39:43.787
Robin!

39:44.715 --> 39:45.887
Robin!

39:58.629 --> 39:59.630
She's not here.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.839
We're going to have to call it in.
I'll find the breaker.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.428
Hank.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.570
Hank, she's here.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.408
It's okay, honey. We're police.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.719
I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

40:59.523 --> 41:02.561
It's okay now.
We're going to take you home.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.037
There's so much I don't understand.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.147
There are so many things
I need to ask you.

41:16.607 --> 41:19.918
I love Juliette and I don't
want anything to happen to her.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.194
I want you to know whatever
it is I'm supposed to do,

41:25.883 --> 41:26.884
I'll do it.

41:30.454 --> 41:31.455
You!

42:10.060 --> 42:11.869
Is she dead? No.

42:12.129 --> 42:13.472
He was there.

42:13.597 --> 42:15.099
That's unfortunate.

42:15.666 --> 42:17.145
We'll just have to try again.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.606
Let's hope she doesn't
wake up first.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
