ANNOUNCER:
<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.572
<i>Carol told Jodie</i>
<i>she wanted to see the baby,</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:07.573
<i>and after seeing the baby,</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.074
<i>she told Jodie</i>
<i>she wanted the baby</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:11.076
<i>and would take him to court</i>
<i>for custody.</i>

00:11.077 --> 00:13.078
<i>The doctor told Mary</i>
<i>that she's pregnant,</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:15.581
<i>and then he told Burt</i>
<i>that he was going to die.</i>

00:15.582 --> 00:18.083
<i>Although Mary told Burt</i>
<i>she's pregnant,</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:19.585
<i>Burt didn't tell Mary</i>
<i>he's going to die,</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:21.086
<i>but he did tell Danny,</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:23.589
<i>and then the doctor told Burt</i>
<i>he had made a mistake</i>

00:23.590 --> 00:26.091
<i>and told him he wasn't</i>
<i>going to die after all.</i>

00:26.092 --> 00:27.593
<i>Mary,</i>
<i>who's happy she's pregnant,</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:29.595
<i>is worried</i>
<i>the baby might be an alien,</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:31.597
<i>something she hasn't told Burt.</i>

00:31.598 --> 00:34.099
<i>Danny and Polly told each other</i>
<i>they loved each other,</i>

00:34.100 --> 00:36.101
<i>and then they told</i>
<i>a real estate broker</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:37.102
<i>they wanted a house.</i>

00:37.103 --> 00:39.605
<i>The real estate broker</i>
<i>told them he had a nice house,</i>

00:39.606 --> 00:40.606
<i>but there was no telling</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:42.107
<i>how nice the neighbors would be.</i>

00:42.108 --> 00:43.108
<i>Chester told Jessica</i>

00:43.109 --> 00:45.611
<i>he was in love</i>
<i>with the minister's daughter,</i>

00:45.612 --> 00:47.112
<i>and Jessica threw him</i>
<i>out of the house</i>

00:47.113 --> 00:48.614
<i>and told him never to come back.</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:51.116
<i>Then Jessica got depressed</i>
<i>and went to a psychiatrist,</i>

00:51.117 --> 00:53.118
<i>who told her</i>
<i>she was perfectly normal</i>

00:53.119 --> 00:54.620
<i>and that he wanted to date her.</i>

00:54.621 --> 00:56.121
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

00:56.122 --> 00:58.624
<i>the minister's daughter</i>
<i>told Chester he was too old,</i>

00:58.625 --> 00:59.625
<i>and she left him.</i>

00:59.626 --> 01:01.627
<i>Billy told Jessica</i>
<i>he was getting tired of Leslie,</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:03.629
<i>and Dutch told Eunice</i>
<i>he knew she was cheating,</i>

01:03.630 --> 01:06.131
<i>and Eunice told Dutch</i>
<i>she wouldn't do it again,</i>

01:06.132 --> 01:07.633
<i>then Dutch found a note</i>
<i>telling him</i>

01:07.634 --> 01:09.134
<i>that Eunice had run away</i>
<i>with another man.</i>

01:09.135 --> 01:10.636
<i>Dutch told Corinne,</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:12.137
<i>and Corinne told Dutch</i>

01:12.138 --> 01:13.639
<i>he was still welcome</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:15.140
<i>One thing led to another</i>

01:15.141 --> 01:17.142
<i>and Dutch and Corinne</i>
<i>wound up in bed together,</i>

01:17.143 --> 01:18.644
<i>so there's no telling</i>
<i>what will happen.</i>

01:18.645 --> 01:20.145
<i>Confused?</i>

01:20.146 --> 01:23.649
<i>You won't be</i>
<i>after this episode of...</i> Soap.

01:27.654 --> 01:30.656
<i>This is story of two sisters,</i>

01:30.657 --> 01:32.658
<i>Jessica Tate...</i>

01:32.659 --> 01:35.160
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

01:35.161 --> 01:38.664
<i>These are the Tates.</i>

01:38.665 --> 01:42.167
<i>And these are the Campbells.</i>

01:42.168 --> 01:45.171
<i>And this is...</i> Soap.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.206
What did you say?

02:22.208 --> 02:23.709
What did I just hear you say?

02:25.712 --> 02:27.714
Go on, say it...

02:32.719 --> 02:34.220
Go on, say it to my face.

02:37.724 --> 02:42.728
Come on, you chicken-livered,
yellow-bellied... person.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.229
Go on,
I dare you to say it again.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.731
Go ahead.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.734
I thought that's what you said.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.237
You get out of town
while the getting's good,

02:52.238 --> 02:54.740
while you still got legs
to walk on.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.741
Hey, Burt, can I play?

02:55.742 --> 02:57.743
I'm not playing, Danny.
I'm practicing.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.745
For what?

02:59.746 --> 03:01.246
Remember when I thought
I was dying?

03:01.247 --> 03:02.247
Yeah.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.248
Well, I realized then

03:03.249 --> 03:05.250
that I'd always had a really
kind of selfish life.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.752
I never really helped
my fellow man,

03:06.753 --> 03:08.253
and now that
I'm gonna live, Danny,

03:08.254 --> 03:09.254
I'm gonna change all that.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.256
I'm gonna make good on it.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
Dan...

03:12.759 --> 03:14.761
I'm gonna run for sheriff.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.764
You are?

03:18.765 --> 03:20.265
Burt, that's great!

03:20.266 --> 03:22.768
Wow. Hey!
Can I be your deputy?

03:22.769 --> 03:24.770
Let me be your deputy, Burt.
I'd be a great deputy.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.271
Come on,
let me be your deputy, Burt.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.773
Please. Please.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.775
Danny, a deputy's
gotta be trained.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.777
In what?
He's gotta be a cop.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.278
I need a real cop.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.780
I'll be one.
I'll go to cop school.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.281
Oh, Burt, please,

03:36.282 --> 03:37.783
please.

03:37.784 --> 03:38.784
Danny, I haven't
been elected yet.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.786
Oh, you'll get elected.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.287
People hate Sheriff Prentice.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.289
They spit on his car.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.291
Prentice. Prentice. He's bad.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.292
He's a bad, corrupt man.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.293
He's been bad for Dunn's River,

03:48.294 --> 03:50.295
and we need
to clean up this town,

03:50.296 --> 03:51.296
and I intend to do it.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.798
Let's practice.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.799
You be a speeding driver.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.300
I'll catch you.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.302
If I was a speeding driver,
you'd never catch me.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.305
Pretend, Dan.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.807
I'm gonna pretend
to be a killer.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.308
A speeding driver
who kills people.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.811
All right, Danny, please.
Let's go. Come on. All right.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.312
Now, you're tooling
down the highway,

04:07.313 --> 04:08.814
and I'm coming up
from behind you,

04:08.815 --> 04:09.815
and I'll stop you.
Ready?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.828
Pull over!

04:31.337 --> 04:33.339
Damn.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.346
Now I'm gonna approach the car.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.348
Now, you gotta do this
very carefully

04:43.349 --> 04:44.349
because, you know,
more cops get killed

04:44.350 --> 04:46.852
approaching cars
then anywhere else.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.854
I mean, you gotta approach
it very carefully

04:48.855 --> 04:50.355
in case the guy is armed.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.359
The important thing here,
to be a moving target.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.373
What's the rush, big guy?

05:08.374 --> 05:10.876
Let me give you my license,
officer.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.879
Hey!

05:14.380 --> 05:15.380
Got you.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.381
I got you first.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.382
You did not.
You winged me.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.884
What do you mean, winged you?

05:18.885 --> 05:19.885
I killed you.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.886
I got you in the head.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.387
I got you in the heart!

05:22.388 --> 05:23.889
You did not!
I did too!

05:23.890 --> 05:25.390
Boys!

05:25.391 --> 05:28.393
Boys, if you cannot play nicely,
you'll have to play outside.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.395
Ma, he's gonna be sheriff.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.897
Burt's gonna be sheriff,

05:31.898 --> 05:32.898
and I'm gonna be the deputy.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.399
After dinner.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.401
I don't think it's gonna happen
that fast.

05:36.402 --> 05:40.405
Mare. Mare, what Danny's
trying to say is...

05:40.406 --> 05:41.406
You ready for this?

05:43.409 --> 05:45.911
I've decided to run for sheriff.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.418
Hello.

05:53.859 --> 05:55.420
Sheriff, are you crazy?
What if you win?

05:55.421 --> 05:57.422
Do you know
how dangerous that is?

05:57.423 --> 05:58.924
You just got over almost dying.

05:58.925 --> 05:59.925
You want to try again?

05:59.926 --> 06:01.927
Well, maybe this time,
he'll get it right.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.428
This time...

06:03.429 --> 06:04.429
No, no, Mare, listen to me.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.430
Mare, Mare, I'm talking about...

06:05.431 --> 06:06.932
I wanna contribute to the world.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.433
I wanna help my fellow man.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.935
I wanna clean up this town.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.938
This is not Dodge City, Burt.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.942
You want to clean something up,
clean up the garage.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.444
Boy, I love that.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.947
"Clean up this town."

06:21.948 --> 06:24.950
You're starting to sound
like a sheriff already.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.451
Hey, listen,
can I be your deputy?

06:26.452 --> 06:27.953
Come on, let me be
your deputy, huh, Burt?

06:27.954 --> 06:30.956
Hang on. No. I'm
gonna be the deputy.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.958
Oh, come on, Burt,
I'd be a natural.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.459
It's in my genes.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.462
My uncle was a nightstick.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.465
Burt, you're not seriously
going to do this.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.466
Yeah, Mare, what's the matter?

06:41.467 --> 06:42.968
There's nothing to worry about.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.971
Nothing to worry to about?
What if you get killed?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.973
Mare, I'm not gonna get killed.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.475
Okay. Okay,
what experience have you had?

06:50.476 --> 06:52.978
What do you know
about being a sheriff?

06:52.979 --> 06:54.980
I know everything
I need to know.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
Mary, I got reflexes.

06:56.482 --> 07:00.986
Reflexes, guts,
and a will of iron.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.487
Yeah.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.489
Mom, he'll make a great sheriff.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.490
Look how good he looks.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.492
BURT: Yeah,
come on, please.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.994
All right, just let me show you
my reflexes.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.495
I got the reflexes of a snake.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.998
Here. Danny, this is a knife.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.499
We're going to pretend
this is a knife.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.502
Now, Danny's gonna play
a mad, psychotic,

07:17.503 --> 07:19.004
sick, demented killer.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.007
He's going to come at me
with a knife,

07:22.008 --> 07:24.509
I will disarm him,
and I will apprehend him.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.510
Please watch.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.040
Hi.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.041
Mm!

07:56.042 --> 07:58.543
There you are.
Where have you been?

07:58.544 --> 08:01.046
Jessica,
you'll swallow the cotton.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.547
Mm? Oh...

08:02.548 --> 08:04.549
Oh, Mary, I waited
and waited for you.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.551
I had to go to the obstetrician.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.054
I didn't want
to come in here without you.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.555
I hid in the ladies' room,

08:10.556 --> 08:14.059
and that pushy dental hygienist
came in and found me.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.560
Did you have novocaine?

08:15.561 --> 08:16.561
Yeah. You?

08:17.563 --> 08:19.564
I asked to be put to sleep,

08:19.565 --> 08:22.568
but he refused to do that
for just a cleaning.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.073
What did the baby doctor say?

08:28.074 --> 08:30.075
Everything seems
to be just fine.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.077
Oh, you see?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.578
Jessica, I could still
give birth to an alien.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.580
There's no way of telling now.

08:35.581 --> 08:36.581
Have you told Burt yet?

08:36.582 --> 08:37.582
No.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.583
Well, maybe he'll never know.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.087
If the baby comes out silver,
he'll know.

08:44.090 --> 08:47.592
Probably.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.095
What's happening with you
and that psychiatrist?

08:50.096 --> 08:51.596
Oh, he's very nice, Mary.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.598
He is very, very nice.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.100
Have you slept with him?

08:55.101 --> 08:57.102
Oh, no.
I'd be afraid to.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.103
Why?

08:58.104 --> 08:59.604
Well, because, Mary,
he's a psychiatrist.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.606
He's gotta be the greatest
lover in the world.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.108
They know everything about sex.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.110
They're the ones
that write those books.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.112
So, you see,

09:07.113 --> 09:08.613
I cannot sleep with him

09:08.614 --> 09:12.617
until I'm sure that I can do it
absolutely perfectly.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.120
There is no
absolutely perfectly.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.122
Well, there's very good.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.625
So I won't do it
until I know that I'm very good.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.627
Of course, I don't know
how in the world

09:22.628 --> 09:24.629
I'm going to get in
any practice.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.133
Oh, Jessica,
I'm sure you're very good.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.635
I don't know.
I mean, how can you tell?

09:30.636 --> 09:32.137
With tennis,

09:32.138 --> 09:36.641
I can look at Chris Evert,
and I know I'm not, but this...

09:36.642 --> 09:38.143
I'm beginning to get
a little numb.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.644
Mm... Me too.

09:39.645 --> 09:43.648
Mary... uh, did you ever...?

09:43.649 --> 09:45.150
I don't know how to put this.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.152
You know, sometimes
when you're at a party,

09:47.153 --> 09:48.653
and you're having an awful time,

09:48.654 --> 09:51.656
and you dance and laugh
like you're having a lot of fun.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.158
Do you ever do that in bed?

09:55.661 --> 09:57.662
Dance and laugh?

09:57.663 --> 09:59.664
No.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.665
You mean fake it?

10:00.666 --> 10:01.666
Shh!

10:01.667 --> 10:03.668
Is that what you mean?
Did I ever fake it?

10:03.669 --> 10:04.669
Yes.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.670
Did you?

10:05.671 --> 10:06.671
Maybe once.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.673
Oh.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.176
You?
Maybe once.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.178
The only time I do it
is when I'm tired,

10:13.179 --> 10:16.681
and I just want
to get him to stop.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.184
Well, once in a while,

10:19.185 --> 10:21.186
I have simply because I couldn't

10:21.187 --> 10:24.189
and I didn't want him
to think he was bad.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.691
Of course that made it
more difficult later on

10:26.692 --> 10:27.692
when he continued to do

10:27.693 --> 10:31.196
what he thought
had worked so well before.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.701
Could I have a drink of water?

10:36.702 --> 10:37.702
Oh, yeah.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.705
Sure. Here.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.711
Oh, God.
Look what I've done.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.213
I have no feeling in my face.

10:48.214 --> 10:52.217
Oh, Mary, that's very funny.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.218
Look at you.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.720
You're crooked.

10:55.721 --> 10:58.223
You're laughing crooked.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.724
Don't make me laugh.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.727
Your mouth is going downhill.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.730
Here, I'll get us some towels.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.733
I just love these gadgets.

11:08.734 --> 11:09.734
Look at this.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.243
I can see one nostril.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.245
I like the drill
that squirts water.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.247
I hate the drill.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.748
I hate this place.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.252
I'm leaving.
My teeth are fine.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.253
Jessica...

11:28.254 --> 11:30.255
No, he'll make me spit
in the bowl, Mary,

11:30.256 --> 11:31.756
and I can't spit in the bowl.

11:31.757 --> 11:32.757
It's so rude,

11:32.758 --> 11:34.759
and the one time
I tried to spit in the bowl,

11:34.760 --> 11:37.262
I missed it,
and I spit on his leg.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.266
Goodbye, Mary.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.767
Jessica, come on, now.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.769
You have been doing this
since we were children.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.771
It'll be okay.

11:46.772 --> 11:47.772
Really.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.274
I'll hold your hand.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.275
Come on.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.777
Okay, Mrs. Campbell,
we're ready for you.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.778
Oh, God. No.

11:53.779 --> 11:54.779
Oh, Mary.

11:54.780 --> 11:55.780
I can't.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.782
Of course you can, Mary.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.784
Come on, it's gonna be easy.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.287
Come on, I'll stay with you,

12:02.288 --> 12:04.289
and I'll hold your hand,

12:04.290 --> 12:09.294
and I'll... I'll
sing to you, Mary.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.795
You promise?

12:10.796 --> 12:12.297
I promise.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.310
And that's the whole story,
Mr. Mallu.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.312
She came back for the baby,

12:27.313 --> 12:29.314
and I came to you
because you're the best.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.315
I'm really up a tree.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.317
Yup.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.319
Well, what do you suggest?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.321
Build a tree house.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.822
Excuse me?

12:37.823 --> 12:40.825
Look, I've had it
with your family.

12:40.826 --> 12:43.328
I've never met such a bunch
of lunatics in my life.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.829
Hey, wait a minute.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.331
And the thing of it is,

12:46.332 --> 12:49.334
they're all
specialized lunatics.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.835
One guy plays with dolls.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.837
Another guy
thinks he's invisible.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.340
The old man is...
somewhere in the South Pacific.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.844
Plus, I fell in love
with your Aunt Jessica.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.346
Jessica, Jessica.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.847
My God, how is she?

13:02.848 --> 13:04.349
I take it
you're not gonna help me.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.351
The Lone Ranger
couldn't help you.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.853
Well, I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time.

13:08.854 --> 13:09.854
How is she?

13:09.855 --> 13:10.855
Who?

13:10.856 --> 13:11.856
Your Aunt Jessica.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.858
Are you gonna
take the case or not?

13:13.859 --> 13:15.860
She's the most beautiful,
exciting woman I've ever met.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.362
Mr. Mallu!

13:17.363 --> 13:18.363
I can't take the case.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.365
I don't do custody cases.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.866
The father rarely wins.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.868
I don't like to lose.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.372
My father said to me once,
"Hey, Ronald," he said,

13:27.373 --> 13:31.377
"Winning isn't everything,
but losing sucks."

13:36.882 --> 13:39.384
Mr. Mallu, this is not about
winning or losing.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.386
This is about
the fate of one child.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.887
That's good stuff.

13:42.888 --> 13:46.391
Your Honor, this case
isn't about winning or losing.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.892
It's about the fate
of one small child.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.395
I stuck in "small." It gives it
more impact. Good stuff.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.397
See, I'm a good father,
and she's a lousy mother.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.398
Doesn't matter.
She's the mother.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.899
You'll be laughed out of court.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
But that's my daughter!

13:55.901 --> 13:56.901
You're a homosexual!

13:56.902 --> 13:57.902
You're a coward!

13:57.903 --> 13:59.404
What?

13:59.405 --> 14:02.407
A lawyer is somebody
who protects and defends people.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.409
The only thing
you're interested in protecting

14:04.410 --> 14:05.910
is yourself.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.413
I need a lawyer, Mr. Mallu.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.415
Good day.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.917
It isn't gonna be easy.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.919
Does this mean
you change your mind?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.421
Is there a law against that?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
There are a few things
I have to know.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.425
Shoot.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.926
Tell me,

14:21.927 --> 14:25.430
is her hair still as red
as the Acapulco sunset?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.432
Who?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.433
Forget it.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.434
Better I don't know.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.935
Is it?
Mr. Mallu!

14:30.936 --> 14:32.437
No, cancel it.
Never mind.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.440
We have to find a way
to discredit the child's mother.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.441
That won't be easy.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.443
Mr. Dallas, please.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.946
I've been discrediting people
since before you were born.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.448
All we have to do is show

14:43.449 --> 14:44.949
that the woman
associated herself

14:44.950 --> 14:45.990
with nefarious characters.

14:47.413 --> 14:48.453
Who was her last employer?

14:48.454 --> 14:50.455
You were.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.457
Carol David?
My former assistant?

14:52.458 --> 14:53.458
That's her.

14:53.459 --> 14:58.963
This is a spider web
of intrigue.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.466
Twisted plots. High drama.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.967
We'll get the movie rights.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.969
Alan Alda can play me.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.471
Okay, okay.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.973
Let's see what we've got here.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.475
You are a, ahem,

15:10.476 --> 15:11.976
homosexual.

15:11.977 --> 15:12.977
And as I remember,

15:12.978 --> 15:14.479
you once tried
to commit suicide.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.480
Does anyone know that?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.482
Carol.
Swell.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.484
It was right before
my sex-change operation...

15:19.485 --> 15:20.985
You used to be a woman?

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
No, no, no. I didn't do it.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.988
Too bad.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.992
Two mothers
fighting over the same child?

15:28.994 --> 15:31.496
Talk about a movie.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.997
Okay, okay.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.500
Let me wade through this
and see what I come up with.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.502
If I need any more information,
I'll get in touch.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.505
You really think
we have a chance?

15:41.006 --> 15:42.507
If there's a crack
in the plaster,

15:42.508 --> 15:45.009
we'll knock down the wall.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.512
I'll be in touch.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.014
One more thing.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.015
Yeah?

15:51.016 --> 15:54.018
Does she ever... talk about me?

15:54.019 --> 15:55.019
Carol?

15:55.020 --> 15:57.021
Jessica.
Mr. Mallu!

15:57.022 --> 15:58.702
Forget it. Never mind.
I'll call you later.

16:01.026 --> 16:04.028
Thanks, Mr. Mallu.
I really appreciate this.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.531
This is the most important
thing in my life.

16:11.537 --> 16:15.541
Wanda, call my fiancée
and cancel my marriage.

16:21.046 --> 16:24.549
Corinne, which scarf
do you think looks the best?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.551
Well, I don't know.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.052
Oh, they both look bad.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.554
Oh, Ma, you look lovely.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.055
Oh, Corinne,

16:31.056 --> 16:34.058
my psychiatrist
is coming to dinner,

16:34.059 --> 16:37.062
and I look
like an organ grinder.

16:40.566 --> 16:41.566
Hi.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.567
Hi.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.569
You look nice.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.070
I do?

16:46.071 --> 16:47.071
Yeah.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.074
Oh.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.097
Oh, here, taste the sauce
for the duck.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.581
How is it?

16:56.582 --> 16:57.582
Mmm, it's wonderful.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.083
It stinks.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.084
It's them apricots.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.586
One apricot too many,

17:01.587 --> 17:03.087
and the whole sauce
is down the soup.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.090
Oh, dear.
Oh, that's him.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.593
That's him. Oh...

17:08.594 --> 17:12.598
Oh, dear God, please
let everyone behave tonight.

17:13.598 --> 17:14.598
Hi.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.599
Hi.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.601
Come in.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.102
This is Corinne.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.104
Hi.
Hi.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.106
And this is Dutch.
Hi.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.608
The sauce just bit the big one.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.111
Fine.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.613
Corinne is my daughter.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.114
I know.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.617
And Dutch is, uh...

17:32.618 --> 17:36.120
our friend.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.121
But don't get the wrong idea.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.623
Yeah, the other night,
that didn't mean nothing.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.626
He's right.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.629
Yeah, that wasn't
just wanton sex.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.130
Excuse me.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.632
I gotta go baste my duck.

17:49.134 --> 17:52.136
Do you feel that
they're being foolish?

17:52.137 --> 17:53.638
Jessica, I don't have
the faintest idea

17:53.639 --> 17:55.139
what they're talking about.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.141
Thank you for your discretion.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.147
Yes?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.649
Excuse me.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.150
I'm the maitre d'
of the Tokyo Gardens.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.652
Is Mrs. Tate in?

18:07.653 --> 18:09.654
Why, yes.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.656
Mr. Teshamado,
please come in.

18:11.657 --> 18:12.657
Come in.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.159
What a surprise to see you.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.661
Mrs. Tate,
I hate to be a bother,

18:16.662 --> 18:18.162
but I'm afraid he's at it again.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.664
Oh, dear.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.166
This time,
he took them all at once.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.167
The dishes are piling up.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.670
The place is in total chaos.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.173
Oh, I am so sorry,
Mr. Teshamado.

18:29.174 --> 18:33.177
Oh, Daddy!
Mr. Teshamado is here.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.193
Well, general,
I've got to hand it to you.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.194
They didn't tell me a thing.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.196
I shall expect a release

18:52.197 --> 18:55.700
of the same number
of my officers by 0600.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.203
Carry on.

19:01.707 --> 19:02.707
My father.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.208
I guessed.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.711
Oh, dear.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.216
Sayonara and tempura.

19:12.217 --> 19:13.217
Burt...

19:13.218 --> 19:14.719
Hey, Jess, what do you think?

19:14.720 --> 19:16.220
Huh?
I knew you'd love it.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.222
It's like this. I got
a whole assortment here.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.223
What do you see?

19:19.224 --> 19:20.725
Hold the presses.
Take your pick.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.728
Take a gamble,
vote for Campbell. Huh?

19:23.729 --> 19:26.230
Wait a minute,
this is even better.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.232
I got more here.
Look at this one.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.736
Graft is dirty, vote for Burty.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.738
Huh? What do you think?

19:33.739 --> 19:35.239
Hi, stranger.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.241
My name is Burt Campbell.
I'd never lie to you.

19:37.242 --> 19:38.743
I know I can count on your vote.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.244
That's it. Wait a minute.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.746
This is my most
favorite one of all.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.247
This is the one.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.751
Vote for Burt.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.253
Doesn't rhyme, but I think
it sort of says it all.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.756
I think the outfit
sort of says it all.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.758
Oh, I like you, stranger.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.760
Here, be my guest.

19:55.761 --> 19:56.761
Corinne, here.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.764
Jess. I'm on the trail.

19:59.765 --> 20:00.765
Leslie.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.266
Leslie?

20:02.267 --> 20:03.768
Leslie.
Leslie, the teacher.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.770
Magna Carta. Louisiana Purchase.
How you doing?

20:05.771 --> 20:06.771
Fine.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.272
Oh, here.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.273
Here's something
for your bumpers.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.775
Excuse me, I gotta go.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.276
My brother-in-law.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.278
Is Billy home?

20:14.279 --> 20:16.280
No, dear, I'm afraid he isn't.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.282
Oh.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.284
It's Billy's teacher.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.287
She's a little upset
because he's not home.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.792
She must get hysterical
when he's late for class.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.794
He's left me.
I just know it.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.295
Uh...

20:31.296 --> 20:33.798
Oh, Leslie, why don't you
just go upstairs

20:33.799 --> 20:35.299
and freshen up, dear,

20:35.300 --> 20:36.801
and then you can join us
later for dinner.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.303
Oh, thank you.

20:39.304 --> 20:40.805
Jessica, is it always like this?

20:40.806 --> 20:43.308
Always like what?

20:46.311 --> 20:49.814
I think I should set up
an office here.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.821
Daddy...

20:56.822 --> 20:58.823
I'm back, Jess.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.325
Oh, God. I'm back.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.827
Chester...

21:02.828 --> 21:04.328
Before you say a word, Jess,

21:04.329 --> 21:06.831
I would like you to know
I've strayed,

21:06.832 --> 21:08.833
but I am back, Jess.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.334
I left her.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.335
I had to leave her.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.837
Broke her heart.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.839
She pleaded with me,
offered me money, new clothes,

21:14.840 --> 21:16.841
but I pushed her aside, Jess.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.343
In short, I'm home.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.347
Chester, this is Alan Posner.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.348
Dr. Alan Posner.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.850
Ah...

21:25.851 --> 21:26.851
He's my date.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.352
But I live here.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.353
Not anymore.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.855
Does he?
Not yet.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.366
Chester, I told you
never to come here again.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.368
But I'm all right now, Jess.

21:44.369 --> 21:47.371
Really, you know the problem
that I had with... cheating.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.373
Well, I went to a clinic,

21:49.374 --> 21:52.877
and they told me it was
a simple allergic reaction.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.378
Bull.
Bull?

21:54.379 --> 21:57.882
Bull, and this man, Chester,
is a psychiatrist.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.383
Now, I want you to leave.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.385
You don't belong here anymore.

22:01.386 --> 22:06.390
Very well, Jess.
I'll go... if you wish.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.893
I'm going to get you back, Jess.

22:08.894 --> 22:11.896
I love you,
and I'm going to win you back.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.398
Hope you like
a good fight, my man,

22:14.399 --> 22:18.402
because I'm going to fight,
and I am going to win.

22:18.403 --> 22:21.405
Oh, Jess!
Please take me back!

22:21.406 --> 22:22.907
Chester, get up.
Get up.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.408
All right.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.411
All right, I'll leave,
but I shall return.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.413
I shall return.

22:29.414 --> 22:31.916
MAJOR:
Is MacArthur here?

22:34.419 --> 22:37.922
Dinner is served.

22:37.923 --> 22:40.424
You must think we're crazy.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.926
Oh, don't be silly.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.928
You mean you don't think
we're crazy?

22:43.929 --> 22:47.431
No. Eccentric maybe,
but crazy, no.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.934
Jessica, if there is anyone
crazy in this house, it's me.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.435
You?

22:51.436 --> 22:53.437
I've only known you for
a short amount of time, Jessica,

22:53.438 --> 22:55.439
and I think
I'm in love with you.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.941
Now, that's really crazy.

22:58.944 --> 23:02.947
I have been enamored of you
for quite some time.

23:02.948 --> 23:06.450
But out of respect,
I've admired you from afar.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.952
Oh...

23:07.953 --> 23:10.454
But what you've done
with our boys, wonderful.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.456
Can you believe this?

23:12.457 --> 23:14.959
Dinner with Eleanor Roosevelt.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.473
ANNOUNCER: <i>What are the chances
of Mary having an alien baby?</i>

23:29.474 --> 23:31.976
<i>Would she be able</i>
<i>to find clothes in its size?</i>

23:31.977 --> 23:33.477
<i>Are Billy and Leslie</i>
<i>really through?</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:35.479
<i>How will this affect his grades?</i>

23:35.480 --> 23:37.982
<i>Will Chester win Jessica back</i>
<i>from the psychiatrist?</i>

23:37.983 --> 23:39.984
<i>Now that Mallu is back</i>
<i>handling Jodie's case,</i>

23:39.985 --> 23:42.486
<i>will he be back</i>
<i>to handle Jessica as well?</i>

23:42.487 --> 23:43.988
<i>Will Burt be sheriff?</i>

23:43.989 --> 23:45.990
<i>If Burt is sheriff,</i>
<i>will Danny be deputy?</i>

23:45.991 --> 23:47.992
<i>If Burt is sheriff</i>
<i>and Danny is deputy,</i>

23:47.993 --> 23:49.493
<i>will Mary be mad?</i>

23:49.494 --> 23:50.995
