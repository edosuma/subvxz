WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.184
(Laughter)

00:04.360 --> 00:06.339
85 today!

00:07.080 --> 00:09.184
And I intend to outlive you all!

00:09.360 --> 00:10.987
(Laughter)

00:14.640 --> 00:16.460
(Chatter)

00:28.920 --> 00:30.239
(Laughter and chatter)

00:30.400 --> 00:33.904
- To think of owning a place like this!
- Yeah. A man can dream.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.900
(Gasps) Ross!

00:40.080 --> 00:41.980
(Laughs) You're here!

00:43.440 --> 00:45.419
Is it true? You're enlisting?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.227
62nd Regiment of Foot!

00:47.400 --> 00:48.788
(Gasps)

00:48.960 --> 00:50.905
- (They laugh)
- No, Ross, don't say so!

00:51.080 --> 00:53.298
- Francis, help me persuade him.
- Persuade my father!

00:53.480 --> 00:55.823
- It's his idea.
- Only to save you from the gallows.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.424
- Oh.
- Well, I know someone who
isn’t
impressed!

01:02.120 --> 01:04.543
What's the matter
with the men of this family?

01:04.720 --> 01:08.599
It'll be six months at the most, Aunt.
You'll hardly know I'm gone.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.261
Will she?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.737
How dashing you'll look in regimentals!

01:24.440 --> 01:26.624
- Why else would I enlist?
- (Giggles)

01:41.000 --> 01:42.467
What do they say?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.585
She'll break a few hearts.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.900
- And bear beautiful children.
- But who will be their father?

01:48.080 --> 01:50.344
- Well, not us at any rate.
- Hm.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.186
No, it's always been Ross.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.539
(Giggles)

01:58.280 --> 02:01.864
It will always...be Ross.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.699
(Rustling)

03:07.320 --> 03:09.299
(Hoof beats passing outside)

03:14.840 --> 03:16.899
(Grunts softly)

03:24.760 --> 03:26.739
(Dog barking)

03:40.600 --> 03:42.545
Mrs Tabb. To see Dr Anselm.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.699
BUTLER: We're expecting you, madam.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.945
My child is due in December.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.543
But, for reasons I don't wish to discuss,

03:52.720 --> 03:56.349
I would prefer it to be born
in November or even October.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.585
- And would you wish it to be born alive?
- Of course.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.907
- Is it possible?
- It is.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.360
- But there would be risk.
- To me or the baby?

04:09.360 --> 04:10.497
Both.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.659
Er... Do you have other children?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.180
- Two
- Both full term?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.585
Yes.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.659
And you would wish it to appear
a naturally premature birth?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.501
I would.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.387
(Exhales) Mrs Tabb,

04:29.560 --> 04:31.824
I appreciate that you would not be here at all

04:32.000 --> 04:34.560
were you not in some distress.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.267
So, I shall make up a medicine -

04:36.440 --> 04:39.261
a distillation of herbs
and a fungus that grows on rye.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.907
If you take it exactly as prescribed,

04:43.080 --> 04:46.823
you are likely to produce a living child
in the manner you desire.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.060
- Will a physician attend you?
- Of course.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.987
Should there be any...complications...

04:54.160 --> 04:58.904
_ do not hesitate to take him
Into your confidence Without delay.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.505
I understand.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.579
(Chatter)

05:11.480 --> 05:13.300
So you are still here.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.937
Are you trying to get the law
to charge you with murder?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.907
I've been helping John Craven
tie up Adderley's estate

05:19.080 --> 05:20.900
and settle his debts.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.059
It's the least I can do.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.422
GEORGE: No, I am very aware
of the influence I now lead.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.946
And, I can assure you,
the Prime Minister needs my votes.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.224
So it will be for me, and not him,
to dictate terms.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.265
- (Low conversation)
- (Clattering)

05:36.440 --> 05:38.146
Oh.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.100
Yes, Ross?

05:44.280 --> 05:46.339
What you going to do? Shoot me?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.786
Go on, Ross. Call me out.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.187
Isn't that how you settle
your scores these days?

05:58.160 --> 06:00.139
Good day to you, George.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.382
(Murmuring)

06:10.360 --> 06:12.464
Are you pleased with your candidate,
my Lord?

06:35.600 --> 06:36.988
Madam.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.342
(Horse blows)

06:40.160 --> 06:42.378
Papa!Papa!

06:42.560 --> 06:44.539
May I sit beside you?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.304
May I, Papa? May I?

06:51.240 --> 06:52.980
Your son is speaking to you.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.779
Is he?

07:02.760 --> 07:05.627
Are you incapable of avoiding these scrapes?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.542
- This one was not of my making.
- Are you sure?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.261
I leave for Cornwall tomorrow.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.340
If you have any sense, you'll come with me.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.626
Surely Nampara
is clearer by far to you than London.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.061
Do you blame Ross?

07:31.800 --> 07:33.540
For the duel? Of course.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.304
- Adderley challenged him.
- Because Ross provoked him.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.460
Adderley pursued me
and Ross thought I encouraged him.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.540
I believe he was mistaken.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.039
You do?

07:45.480 --> 07:47.983
It's your nature to be open and warm.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.258
The question is, does Ross intend
to fight every man who falls for you?

07:53.560 --> 07:56.984
- Is that what you fear?
- Worse than that.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.107
I'm beginning to think
he'll never come home.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.779
(Driver urges on horses)

08:29.400 --> 08:33.382
JOHN CRAVEN: Eight...nine...ten...

08:33.560 --> 08:35.107
11...

08:40.160 --> 08:41.229
JOHN CRAVEN: Attend.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.742
(Pistol clicks)

08:42.920 --> 08:45.263
(Demelza singing)

08:50.960 --> 08:52.939
(Groan, then high-pitched tone)

08:58.000 --> 09:00.025
Demelza will be glad to see you.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.223
You must know
that she would never spare a thought

09:06.400 --> 09:08.743
for a worthless rake like Adderley.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.859
(Gulls crying)

09:20.000 --> 09:21.979
(Water dripping)

09:24.920 --> 09:28.663
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.380
(Soft gasp)

09:34.560 --> 09:36.221
- (Retreating footsteps)
- Morvvenna?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.379
(She breathes heavily)

09:39.600 --> 09:41.545
Morwenna!

09:44.240 --> 09:45.980
Morwenna!

09:47.720 --> 09:49.699
I made a wish.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.579
The same wish.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.585
It will never be granted.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.781
I told you why.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.427
An' yet...

10:09.720 --> 10:12.860
...do 'ee not think there be more
to life than carnal love?

10:16.400 --> 10:20.097
Just...bein' together?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.262
Seein' together all that's good an' pure

10:24.440 --> 10:27.466
an'...rare an' beautiful in the world?

10:29.320 --> 10:32.300
The glow of corn an' the smell of spring.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.347
Summer rain, autumn wind.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.426
Watchin' you wake...

10:42.920 --> 10:45.024
...watchin' you sleep.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.863
Oh, my love, what is life if 'ee live it alone?

10:53.040 --> 10:55.019
Oh, Drake!

10:56.720 --> 10:58.585
- I knew this would happen.
- Marry me!

11:02.160 --> 11:04.720
Be my wife...in name only.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.622
I'll...never ask 'ee for more.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.620
Do 'ee not love me?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.865
(Exhales)

11:17.040 --> 11:19.417
(Tearfully) Of course I love you!

11:20.400 --> 11:22.459
This has never been just about love.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.539
But it has.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.339
And can only ever be.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.261
Will 'ee walk with me?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.619
(Man calls out)

12:34.680 --> 12:36.227
(Demelza laughs)

12:59.200 --> 13:02.385
Papa, when can I have a real horse?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.147
Papa is reading.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.697
I'm sure he'll arrange it when we're home.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.665
I have business to attend to in Truro.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.784
Oh. I was hoping to go to Trenwith.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.939
Hm. You may do as you please.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.739
(Rustling)

13:31.880 --> 13:33.780
(Dull roar of waves)

13:35.360 --> 13:37.146
(Fire crackling)

13:38.520 --> 13:39.657
(Door opens)

13:39.840 --> 13:41.057
(Gasps)

13:43.360 --> 13:45.339
(Door swings shut)

13:48.760 --> 13:50.705
Morwenna say she'll wed me.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.386
Oh! Oh, my dear! I'm that glad!

13:56.120 --> 13:58.782
Since he lost you, he's only been half alive.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.064
He'll make you such a loving husband.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.339
No woman could wish for better.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.579
I believe you.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.824
Though she say she'll wed me,
she's not safe caught.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.822
An' till she be, I'm afeared something
may happen to change her mind.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.186
ROSS: Tregothnan nears.
Here's where I alight.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.023
What business could be more important
than returning to your wife?

14:47.200 --> 14:51.500
The business of ensuring
a graceful reconciliation with Westminster.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.259
(Bell tolling)

14:58.320 --> 15:01.585
Be off with you!
We want none of you Methody folks here.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.141
Oh, er...Mistress Poldark.
Did you wish to see me?

15:05.320 --> 15:09.586
I did indeed, sir. My brother Drake
do wish to wed Morvvenna Whitworth.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.182
And that directly.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.987
Well, as you know, ma'am,

15:13.160 --> 15:15.663
the banns must be read
every Sunday for three weeks.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.224
Three weeks?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.584
I seem to recall when Captain Poldark -

15:19.760 --> 15:22.979
now Member for Truro,
and close friend of Lord Falmouth,

15:23.160 --> 15:25.742
in whose gift this living do lie -

15:25.920 --> 15:28.741
when he and I were wed,
there was mention of a "special licence"?

15:28.920 --> 15:31.980
Ah, yes...there is such a thing.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.505
But it would have to be obtained
from the Archdeacon in Bodmin.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.022
And he would need to be convinced

15:37.200 --> 15:40.624
that the applicant was a person
of standing and respectability.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.257
Well, then, who better
than an applicant's upstanding

15:43.440 --> 15:45.419
and respectable sister to vouch for him?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.387
So you read the banns
and we'll fetch the licence.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.622
You'd do that for me?

15:54.800 --> 15:57.780
Go and tell Morwenna,
then meet me at the crossroads.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.739
Elizabeth.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.339
Demelza.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.581
- Are you well?
- Thank you, yes.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.066
- When do you expect?
- In December.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.587
I wish you an easy birthing.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.779
If such a thing exists!

16:33.480 --> 16:35.459
And you, young sir.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.143
- D'you know what will happen soon?
- Papa will come?

16:42.160 --> 16:43.627
Christmas will come.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.897
And there'll be custards an' cakes.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.661
- And presents?
- (Laughs)

16:52.520 --> 16:54.829
I may not see you before, so...

16:56.360 --> 16:59.102
...may I wish you the very best
for the season.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.947
And the new century!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.581
May it bring us joy.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.506
(Cork POPS)

17:21.240 --> 17:22.901
(Drink poured)

17:23.080 --> 17:24.502
My Lord,

17:24.680 --> 17:26.739
the truth of what happened
between myself

17:26.920 --> 17:29.741
and Adderley is...widely known.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.189
So, I consider the proper course
is to resign my seat...

17:35.160 --> 17:38.300
...and allow you to appoint
a more suitable person in my place.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.541
(inhales deeply)

17:41.720 --> 17:44.621
This canary has a smoky flavour.

17:45.480 --> 17:49.143
Newer vintage.
Lingers pleasantly on the tongue.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.825
Are you tired of Westminster?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.541
No...not in the least. I...

18:04.240 --> 18:08.222
I have sometimes thought
that in my year or so, sat in Parliament,

18:08.400 --> 18:09.788
that you have tired of me.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.457
It is true, we have not infrequently
been at variance,

18:16.640 --> 18:19.063
but unfortunately for you...

18:20.400 --> 18:24.427
...I like some character in a Member,
you know?

18:27.560 --> 18:29.903
When I wish you to resign...

18:31.920 --> 18:33.308
- (Clink)
- ..I will tell you.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.142
I publish the banns of marriage

18:40.320 --> 18:42.880
between Edward Bray and Eliza Carkeek.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.065
And between...

18:45.240 --> 18:49.779
Drake Came and Mon/venna Whitworth,
all of this parish.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.825
If any of you know cause or just impediment

18:52.000 --> 18:54.059
as to why these marriages
should not take place,

18:54.240 --> 18:56.663
speak now or forever hold your peace.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.865
(Hums softly)

19:00.120 --> 19:02.099
(Knocking)

19:18.840 --> 19:20.626
- Oh...
- Am I intruding?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.419
I heard the banns called this morning.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.579
I came to offer my good wishes.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.258
- But your child, John Conan.
- He's with Lady Whitworth.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.745
I've been staying with my mother.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.104
How could you bring yourself to leave him?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.499
He was taken from me.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.899
As much was taken from me.

20:00.120 --> 20:04.420
And now that I have a better
understanding of what you endured...

20:05.440 --> 20:07.624
...I feel only regret for my part in it.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.619
But you must come to Trenwith.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.665
You were married there last time.
Why not this?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.501
And have Mr Warleggan give me away?

20:17.680 --> 20:20.023
Mr Warleggan is in Truro
and like to remain there.

20:22.040 --> 20:25.988
I would like to see Drake some time.
I hope he does not bear a grudge?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.579
Drake sees only the good in people.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.266
Sometimes there's little enough of it.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.386
I must go.
The wind was rising as I left.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.304
- You walked?
- The exercise is good for me.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.142
- But if you fell...
- Well, why would I?

20:47.320 --> 20:49.982
Did you not do so last time?
With Valentine?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.300
That's true.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.459
Perhaps then...

20:56.320 --> 20:57.662
No, l...| could not ask it.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.626
What?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.301
Perhaps I might feel a little easier

21:01.480 --> 21:03.505
if you were to accompany me
some of the way?

21:07.480 --> 21:09.380
Of course.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.980
For you, sir. Congratulations.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.339
(They mush)

21:47.200 --> 21:49.782
Pitt's office.
Shall I deal with it?

22:35.800 --> 22:37.665
CLOWANCE: Your turn.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.297
(Prudie snoring)

22:42.120 --> 22:43.701
Go on.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.499
(Prudie grunts)

22:48.680 --> 22:50.341
CLOWANCE: I knew you were doing that.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.101
- Rrrrragh!
- (Clowance squeals)

22:53.280 --> 22:54.702
JEREMY: Papa! You're back!

22:54.880 --> 22:57.826
- Where's Demelza?
- Gone Bodmin with Master Drake.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.661
- Why?
- Oh, Mister Ross!

22:59.840 --> 23:02.479
All their doings an' to-ings an' fro-ings!

23:02.640 --> 23:04.665
'Ee don't know the half of it.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.299
Thank you.

23:18.920 --> 23:22.378
Since you've come so far,
will you not step in and see Valentine?

23:22.560 --> 23:24.539
I know he'd appreciate it.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.599
Well, just for a moment.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.827
Where's Morwenna?

23:45.120 --> 23:47.497
She's gone Trenwith
with Mrs Warleggan.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.979
Willingly?

23:56.680 --> 24:00.229
She doesn't say when she'll return.
Or if she'll return.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.143
And Mr Warleggan did go to great lengths
afore to keep you both apart.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.424
- I must go after her.
- Nay, Drake.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.864
If Harry be there... I'll go.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.907
- Nay, I will go.
- None of you will go.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.420
- Ross!
SAM: Brother.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.706
Trenwith is no place to be visiting.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.906
George needs no encouragement
to torment those close to me.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.867
But 'ee must see what Drake do fear?
That Morwenna, once there...

24:30.040 --> 24:31.667
Will be persuaded to stay.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.058
This is one marriage
he will not interfere with.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.457
Ross, you cannot.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.665
Do not follow me.

24:41.760 --> 24:45.901
Valentine, shall we persuade
Aunt Morwenna to stay a few days?

24:46.080 --> 24:49.186
- Oh, yes. Do!
- You could have your old room.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.701
Thank you. It's...

24:53.240 --> 24:55.617
- ...certainly a kind thought.
- (Horse whinnies)

24:57.720 --> 24:59.665
- (Door opens)
- Elizabeth?

24:59.840 --> 25:01.705
- George?
- (Door closes)

25:01.880 --> 25:04.098
Papa. Aunt Morwenna's here.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.379
Well, this is a pleasant scene.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.779
With an unexpected guest.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.060
Well, Morwenna, are you settling in
with Lady Whitworth?

25:36.720 --> 25:39.905
- No doubt you find life rather constricting?
- I really think I must go.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.301
- Did you know Aunt Morwenna's to wed?
- I did not know.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.665
That might be a way
out of your present difficulties.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.501
- Do I know the man?
- I pray you'll excuse me.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.068
George, when all's considered,

25:53.240 --> 25:55.902
it's Morwenna's happiness
which should now be of paramount.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.140
- May I show you my new hobby-horse?
- Bessie, take this child away.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.743
Is it Came?

26:21.520 --> 26:23.181
Yes.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.539
(Laughing) Well! How convenient.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.738
The man who killed your husband
now takes his place.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.262
He did not kill Osborne!

26:33.440 --> 26:35.704
You know very well
Drake's innocence was proved.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.020
Oh, anything can be proved.
All I know is that Carne had the most to gain.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.940
You know nothing about him!

26:41.120 --> 26:43.623
You couldn't begin to understand
the kind of man he is.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.587
- I understand the kind of
fro/lop
you are.
- (Gasps)

26:46.760 --> 26:48.227
- Get out of my house!
- George!

26:48.400 --> 26:51.267
And never show your face here again.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.786
Tell Harry to see her off.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.063
And bring me a bottle of the '94 claret.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.259
(Wind whistles outside)

27:20.600 --> 27:22.659
I have to find her!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.379
(Knocking)

27:33.400 --> 27:34.662
(Door opens)

27:34.840 --> 27:38.025
- I'm looking for Mon/venna Whitworth.
- I don't believe she's here, sir.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.667
In here!

27:44.240 --> 27:46.265
- Where is she?
- Who?

27:46.440 --> 27:47.828
- (Exhales)
- Oh!

27:48.000 --> 27:50.867
The dim-witted trull who's to wed
your dolt of a brother-In-law?

27:51.040 --> 27:53.497
- I threw her out.
- George!

27:53.680 --> 27:56.240
She left minutes ago, across the fields.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.584
You would have missed her
if you came by the road.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.739
I'm obliged to you.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.140
Set foot here again, I'll have you shot.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.779
What do you want, George?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.867
What more do you want?

28:17.760 --> 28:21.708
You have wealth, power, position, influence...

28:21.880 --> 28:24.189
- More than you know!
- You have my family's home,

28:24.360 --> 28:25.861
my family's mine.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.587
And you have Elizabeth.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.778
20 years ago,
you, Francis and I,

28:31.960 --> 28:34.747
we stood in this room...

28:34.920 --> 28:37.104
and we all aspired to her.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.782
Well, there she is.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.466
So I ask you again...

28:51.000 --> 28:53.377
What more do you want?

28:56.960 --> 28:58.700
George!

29:01.160 --> 29:03.139
Ross, I'd like you to leave.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.139
My apologies.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.945
I had no intention of ruining your evening.

29:13.120 --> 29:16.066
Well, you have ruined more than that!

29:16.240 --> 29:17.502
(Breathes deeply)

29:17.680 --> 29:20.023
Please...go.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.504
Forgive me?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.219
I do.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.179
(Door clicks)

29:54.880 --> 29:56.097
(Door slams)

30:04.360 --> 30:06.339
(Dog barks in distance)

30:07.200 --> 30:09.065
(Barking continues)

30:09.240 --> 30:11.617
(Tom Harry calls out)

30:14.320 --> 30:16.299
- (Dog barks)
TOM HARRY: We've got you now!

30:19.000 --> 30:21.377
TOM HARRY: Come on! (Laughs)

30:21.560 --> 30:23.027
(Morwenna gasps)

30:23.200 --> 30:25.179
TOM HARRY: Go on!
- (Barking)

30:30.200 --> 30:31.701
(Tom Harry calls out)

30:31.880 --> 30:33.859
(Barking and snarling)

30:35.160 --> 30:37.139
(Tom Harry laughs)

30:38.600 --> 30:41.626
- We got you now, little Methody!
- (Morvvenna whimpers)

30:41.800 --> 30:44.143
(Ferocious barking)

30:44.760 --> 30:46.705
(Laughter)

30:47.920 --> 30:49.865
Morwenna!

30:50.040 --> 30:51.985
Drake? Drake!

30:52.160 --> 30:53.548
DRAKE: I dare ye!

30:53.720 --> 30:57.065
- Come on! I dare 'ee!
- I thought ye Methody types din't fight.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.741
Well, 'ee thought wrong, brother!

30:58.920 --> 31:01.059
(Barking and snarling)

31:06.640 --> 31:07.902
Next time.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.298
- (Dog growls)
- Next time.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.347
TOM HARRY: G0.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.024
(Dogs continue to bark and snarl)

31:21.040 --> 31:22.621
(Morvvenna whimpers)

31:22.800 --> 31:24.779
My love...

31:31.280 --> 31:33.384
You're safe now, my love.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.539
(Morwenna sobs)

31:49.280 --> 31:51.020
(George clears his throat) I...

31:51.960 --> 31:54.622
...may have spoken out of turn just now...

31:54.800 --> 31:56.779
in the heat of the moment.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.099
I rode here especially to bring you some news.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.943
Must we quarrel over two trivial people
who concern us so little?

32:06.720 --> 32:08.779
There is someone
who concerns us a great deal.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.867
Valentine.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.463
He was vastly upset
by your behaviour to him.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.507
Well, sometimes his prattle annoys me.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.541
He is a cn/Yo’!
Your
child.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.742
Elizabeth...

32:27.840 --> 32:31.139
You must know
for so long I have been In torment...

32:31.320 --> 32:33.663
Because of a thoughtless word
from Geoffrey Charles?

32:33.840 --> 32:35.262
Which you choose to believe?

32:35.440 --> 32:39.501
Whilst all I have said and done
and sworn is utterly dismissed?

32:39.680 --> 32:42.865
How long will you allow this
terrible jealousy to curse our lives?

32:43.040 --> 32:45.543
I thought I'd put it behind me!
I want to put it behind me...

32:45.720 --> 32:48.177
But the poison that hag Agatha...

32:48.360 --> 32:49.497
Agatha?

32:52.320 --> 32:55.619
The night she died...
she told me Valentine was not my child.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.382
She said we'd not been married
long enough for him to be mine.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.824
I fell on the stairs!
The fall brought on my travail.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.423
- Then why would she say so?
- Because she hated you, George!

33:03.600 --> 33:06.945
When you cancelled her birthday party,
she would have done anything to hurt you!

33:07.120 --> 33:08.621
And she knew just where to strike.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.826
- Your son and heir.
- Elizabeth, you...

33:12.000 --> 33:13.786
you must understand.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.987
I... I could not... I cannot help myself.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.981
You know you are the only person
I have ever cared about!

33:21.160 --> 33:23.105
- Then prove it.
- How?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.657
Include Valentine in your love.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.421
(Exhales heavily)

33:32.120 --> 33:34.259
But you never will let go of your suspicions.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.147
And there is nothing I can do
to prove he is your son.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.902
Nothing I can do to assure his inheritance,

33:40.080 --> 33:43.106
his place in society, his happiness!

34:07.320 --> 34:09.299
(Sniffs)

34:20.560 --> 34:22.744
Yes.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.299
His happiness.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.865
DEMELZA: Here, you're safe now.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.267
DRAKE: There you go.
- (Door opens)

34:51.320 --> 34:54.221
Captain Poldark...
I'm sorry to give such trouble.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.905
It's no trouble.
The ride was bracing and the visit short.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.779
But now I think I'd like to go home.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.667
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!

35:22.880 --> 35:24.302
Elizabeth!

35:32.240 --> 35:34.219
(Sniffs) Oh!

35:34.560 --> 35:36.187
- What happened?
- How strange.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.066
I must have fainted.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.060
- Aaargh!
- What... What is it?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.265
I've er... I'm not sure.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.500
The child moved.
And then there was pain.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.660
- I'll call for Dr Choake.
- No!

35:48.840 --> 35:50.307
No, no, I'll be well presently.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.220
Just... Just let me lie down.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.220
Bessie? Call Dr Choake!

35:55.160 --> 35:57.663
Perhaps I should have returned sooner.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.307
For my sake, yes.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.417
For your own? I think not.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.705
Must you always understand me so well?

36:05.880 --> 36:07.859
(Laughs) I'm glad you think I do.

36:09.240 --> 36:13.347
The more I contemplate the mind,
the more I realise its infinite complexity.

36:15.320 --> 36:19.347
Both of us, in our various ways,
have been afflicted.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.539
By my time in France.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.664
And by the loss of our daughter.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.939
The process of recovery
is not straightforward.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.420
But I hope that our abiding love for each other
will mend what has been broken.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.497
(Knocking, door opens)

36:41.680 --> 36:43.102
(Growls)

36:45.480 --> 36:47.459
Thank you.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.977
Elizabeth Warleggan is unwell.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.780
(She groans and gasps)

36:58.000 --> 36:59.786
Dr Choake has been summoned
but you were closer

36:59.960 --> 37:02.337
and my wife requires immediate attention.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.945
Mrs Warleggan, are you able
to tell me what happened?

37:07.120 --> 37:09.463
It's just as before. I fainted.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.839
And then the pain started.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.025
I think the child is coming.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.260
I invite you to wait downstairs.
Please send a maid to me.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.509
(Gasps)

37:18.680 --> 37:20.659
Were the pains more
or less sudden than last time?

37:20.840 --> 37:22.819
More sudden, and more severe.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.787
- And you are now how forward?
- Nearly eight months.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.939
(Panﬁng)

37:33.920 --> 37:37.299
Mrs Parkins was sad
when you left London so suddenly.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.622
She thought you did not like the rooms.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.745
I trust you told her different.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.419
I told her you did not like me.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.584
Will Drake and Morwenna be happy?

37:59.040 --> 38:01.019
I think so.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.309
If two people love, as they love...

38:05.920 --> 38:07.899
You think that's enough?

38:09.640 --> 38:11.904
Sometimes it's too much.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.339
Not in my experience.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.143
(Panﬁng)

38:34.320 --> 38:36.299
(Screams)

38:41.920 --> 38:44.104
(Panﬁng)

38:44.280 --> 38:46.305
(Baby cries)

38:50.920 --> 38:52.785
- You have a daughter.
- Oh!

39:03.320 --> 39:05.026
(Laughs)

39:05.200 --> 39:07.657
Your daughter is small
but in every way healthy.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.183
- And my wife?
- Is well.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.920
In one way, a premature child
is less strain on the mother,

39:13.080 --> 39:14.741
being that much smaller, but...

39:14.920 --> 39:19.266
the spasms were unusually violent
and if this is the result of her fall,

39:19.440 --> 39:22.989
you must take the greatest possible
care of her over the next few weeks.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.940
- I assume Dr Choake will soon be here?
- Within the hour.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.623
Then I'll leave her to his treatment and care.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.584
I bid you good night, sir.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.817
It happened again.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.503
- And so quickly.
- Yes.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.501
And you...er, fell...

40:05.680 --> 40:07.864
fainted...just as before.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.860
Exactly as before.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.817
I see now...how wrong I was...

40:18.320 --> 40:20.629
...to doubt you.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.223
I see the damage I have done...

40:25.600 --> 40:27.704
...to our marriage...

40:29.000 --> 40:30.900
...to our son.

40:33.040 --> 40:37.101
I cannot undo the past
but I can...promise you...

40:38.800 --> 40:41.621
...a future without suspicion...

40:42.600 --> 40:44.500
...without recrimination...

40:45.760 --> 40:47.307
...if you can forgive me.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.709
Go and look at our daughter.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.459
(Cries softly)

41:21.640 --> 41:23.540
What shall we call her?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.541
Ursula.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.379
Ursula.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.260
It means "little she-bear".

41:36.000 --> 41:38.582
I like it. Ursula Warleggan.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.186
Valentine Warleggan.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.867
Our children.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.140
Elizabeth, I have something to tell you.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.346
Before we left London,
I had a meeting with the Prime Minister.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.940
Yesterday, I received a letter from his office.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.904
In recompense for my full support...

42:06.480 --> 42:08.619
...that in the new year...

42:09.480 --> 42:11.141
...I receive a knighthood.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.185
Oh, George!

42:13.360 --> 42:14.702
(Exhales)

42:16.320 --> 42:18.584
I am so very gratified!

42:20.160 --> 42:22.583
I hoped you would be...

42:22.760 --> 42:24.660
Lady Warleggan.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.057
(Laughs)

42:26.240 --> 42:27.901
(Ursula gurgles)

42:33.080 --> 42:35.867
What I did in London was not well done.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.979
No, it was not.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.347
But what I did
when I left you and came home...

42:46.800 --> 42:48.984
That also was not well done.

42:52.120 --> 42:56.022
It seems both of us, at various times,
have caused the other pain.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.985
This time, I'm at fault.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.097
And I plead no excuse.
I killed a man.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.465
Though not the man I wanted to kill.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.739
And because of that...

43:15.120 --> 43:17.497
...I will always wonder, if he were still here...

43:20.600 --> 43:22.465
...would you rather be with him?

43:22.640 --> 43:24.619
(Demelza exhales deeply)

43:25.960 --> 43:29.418
Do you understand me so little
that you seriously ask me that?

43:35.320 --> 43:37.299
(Birdsong)

43:42.480 --> 43:43.947
(Groans)

43:46.720 --> 43:48.699
(Panﬁng)

43:54.000 --> 43:56.821
My wife is in great pain
and has been so for several hours.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.218
The erm...
The premature labour brought on

43:59.400 --> 44:02.824
an acute gouty condition
of the abdominal viscera, manifesting...

44:03.000 --> 44:04.661
What have you prescribed?

44:04.840 --> 44:08.219
Oh, bleeding,
salt of wormwood, ammoniac,

44:08.400 --> 44:11.779
- to increase the elasticity.
- Shall we visit her together?

44:15.920 --> 44:18.059
This is a sad change, Mrs Warleggan.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.458
I wonder what could be the cause?

44:23.600 --> 44:25.420
Can you tell me where the pain is?

44:26.400 --> 44:29.380
My feet and my hands ache.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.940
And I feel so cold.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.023
God knows what has brought her
to such a condition.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.509
Contraction of the arteries,
inhibiting the blood supply,

45:07.680 --> 45:09.307
most dangerously to the limbs.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.459
- Why?
- (Elizabeth moans)

45:12.320 --> 45:16.097
The birth was premature,
the...uterine spasms very rapid.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.544
But that I attributed to the fall...

45:18.720 --> 45:20.699
Though the cause may be obscure,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.946
- the disease hardly so.
- (Elizabeth moans)

45:25.120 --> 45:27.680
(Whispers) What can be done for her?

45:27.840 --> 45:30.661
I thought you should know.
Dwight has been called to Trenwith.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.825
Elizabeth's child was born last night,
again premature.

45:35.640 --> 45:38.780
- But alive?
- Yes, a healthy girl.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.665
Dwight delivered her.
But this morning he was called back.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.822
- Elizabeth is ill.
- How ill?

45:47.440 --> 45:49.658
Dwight is still there.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.342
I think 't'would only be neighbourly
to go and enquire.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.057
Why is it so dark, George?

46:22.600 --> 46:24.147
I'm afraid of the dark.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.502
My love.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.309
Do not be afraid, my love.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.904
I'm here. All will be well.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.026
(Sniffs)

46:50.160 --> 46:51.377
(Knocks)

46:51.560 --> 46:53.221
(Door opens)

46:53.400 --> 46:55.300
I'm here to enquire after Mrs Warleggan.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.459
Turn that man away!

47:01.920 --> 47:04.059
George...for God's sake!

47:04.240 --> 47:07.425
Can we not put aside our quarrels
at a time of sickness?

47:09.480 --> 47:11.380
I am concerned for Elizabeth

47:11.560 --> 47:14.222
_ and will not leave _
until you tell me how she IS.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.947
Elizabeth?

47:16.120 --> 47:19.226
Oh... No, Elizabeth is dead.

47:22.680 --> 47:25.979
Ten minutes since.
She died holding my hand.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.066
(Approaching footsteps)

47:33.240 --> 47:35.105
Ross?

47:36.200 --> 47:38.384
- I think this is not the time...
- May I see her?

47:39.280 --> 47:41.657
Yes. Yes! By all means.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.820
- You know where to find her.
- Ross, if I might suggest...

47:45.000 --> 47:46.900
You've always known
where to find her. Go.

47:47.080 --> 47:49.719
Go! See what we've brought her to!

47:56.520 --> 47:58.260
See...

49:18.560 --> 49:22.508
IfI might suggest...a sedative?

49:22.680 --> 49:24.659
Will it bring her back?

49:25.800 --> 49:27.745
This is a severe setback

49:27.920 --> 49:30.502
and far be it from me
to tell you that you Will recover...

49:30.680 --> 49:32.420
Rec... Recover what?

49:32.600 --> 49:34.465
Recover what?

49:36.200 --> 49:38.623
The... The purpose...

49:40.600 --> 49:42.579
The point...

49:44.200 --> 49:46.623
...of everything?

49:51.400 --> 49:53.584
Why would I want any of this...

49:55.200 --> 49:57.577
...if she is not here to share it with me?

50:09.720 --> 50:12.029
(Baby gurgles)

50:13.920 --> 50:15.979
You still have your daughter.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.624
She does not look like her mother.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.780
She-bear.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.268
I beg your pardon?

50:43.240 --> 50:46.425
Her name...
It means little she-bear.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.977
- (Ursula cries softly)
- Ssh.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.339
(Waves crashing)

52:00.720 --> 52:02.699
(Woman giggling)

52:07.800 --> 52:09.188
(Giggling)

52:56.280 --> 52:57.861
Elizabeth is dead.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.619
Ross...

53:05.440 --> 53:07.067
What can I do?

53:14.280 --> 53:16.020
Walk with me.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.101
So lovely a woman...

53:44.000 --> 53:46.059
...so hideous an end.

53:47.160 --> 53:49.822
Could anything have been done to prevent it?

53:50.000 --> 53:53.185
Not by me.
And not so late in the day.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.507
I believe what killed her
was seeded long ago.

54:04.400 --> 54:08.348
I came home because...
I wanted a different life.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.979
A meaningful life.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.960
To give life. Again.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.879
Only now do I understand
how it was for you when Hugh died.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.979
'Tis not the same.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.385
You loved Elizabeth.

54:42.560 --> 54:43.879
Once.

54:45.960 --> 54:51.705
But it's the memory of that love
that makes me sick at heart today.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.739
For the loss of all she was...

55:00.600 --> 55:02.579
...and all she had to come.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.786
Most of all...

55:11.000 --> 55:12.979
...I feel afraid.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.739
- Of what?
- Of losing you.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.384
Of losing you from my life.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.666
To think that...there will come a time

55:23.840 --> 55:27.105
when I will never hear your voice again...

55:29.320 --> 55:31.026
...nor you mine.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.662
When Hugh died,
I felt a little of this but...

55:44.400 --> 55:47.619
- ...Elizabeth was your first love.
- But not my last.

55:49.960 --> 55:52.622
I made that choice long ago.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.459
And I.

55:56.960 --> 55:59.986
You fear you kept me by default,
because he died?

56:01.920 --> 56:03.979
Not so.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.344
Hugh did touch my heart.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.800
But only you have ever owned it.

56:32.840 --> 56:34.819
(Bells ringing, cheering)

56:52.320 --> 56:54.299
(Birdsong)

56:58.920 --> 57:00.785
(Drake laughs)

57:00.960 --> 57:02.939
PRUDIE: Come this way.

57:03.640 --> 57:05.426
(Prudie chuckles)

57:17.720 --> 57:20.541
- She was not a Warleggan.
- No.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.906
She was a Poldark.

57:24.680 --> 57:27.467
(Low chatter)

57:35.560 --> 57:37.539
Nay, Ross.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.579
There'll be time for such a thing.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.619
(Laughter and chatter)
