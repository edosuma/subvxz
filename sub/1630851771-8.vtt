WEBVTT

00:01.918 --> 00:03.584
Do you know where I can find
more of these empty jars?

00:03.584 --> 00:06.125
Because there's not
any left down there.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.959
I would just open everything up.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.042
Where's she at?

00:10.042 --> 00:11.959
-Oh, my God.
-What?

00:11.959 --> 00:13.125
Why are you making
your drink?

00:13.125 --> 00:14.292
I'm bartender tonight.

00:14.292 --> 00:16.542
Training day is,
like, over with.

00:16.542 --> 00:18.501
Charter number quattro.

00:18.501 --> 00:21.501
They want a Greek dinner
serve family-style.

00:21.501 --> 00:23.626
The primary had recovered
from breast cancer.

00:23.626 --> 00:28.792
â™ª Happy titty day to you

00:28.792 --> 00:29.792
Oh!

00:29.792 --> 00:31.167
Whoa!

00:31.167 --> 00:33.751
Hey, Wes, you need to
attach it to your stern.

00:33.751 --> 00:36.209
What are you doing, Wes?

00:36.209 --> 00:37.417
Clint, let's get on
those jet-skis

00:37.417 --> 00:38.709
and show these boys
how to do it.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.209
Jesus Christ.

00:40.209 --> 00:42.834
This is the Moe, Larry,
and Curly show on steroids.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.125
Wes, Wes!

00:44.125 --> 00:45.167
Is the whole thing
in the water again?

00:45.167 --> 00:47.417
Shut up for a second.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.250
Rayna, can you be
a bit quicker, please?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.209
I'm...
yeah, I'm trying to...

00:50.209 --> 00:51.542
You're just walking...

00:51.542 --> 00:52.834
you're just walking
around, whistling.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.375
Rethink the way you talk to me,

00:54.375 --> 00:56.334
because I swear to God,
you're... I'm not the one.

00:56.334 --> 00:58.542
Remember, he's just getting
into this role right now.

00:58.542 --> 00:59.501
Yeah.

00:59.501 --> 01:03.083
And he's doing a really,
really good job.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.250
-Can you not start with me?
-You only give me sh--.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.751
With everyone else...

01:06.751 --> 01:09.626
Because they're grown adults.
You're a child.

01:09.626 --> 01:11.250
-Quiet!
-I'm trying to be nice to you.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.250
You're getting on
my damn nerves.

01:12.250 --> 01:23.209
What the [bleep]?

01:23.209 --> 01:24.501
I just don't get
why you have

01:24.501 --> 01:26.083
to give me sh--
all the ----ing time.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.751
No, just because
I'm quiet doesn't mean

01:27.751 --> 01:29.459
I'm giving you sh--.
I'm tired, we've had a long day.

01:29.459 --> 01:34.167
Just leave me the [bleep] alone,
that's what that means.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.876
What just happened?

01:35.876 --> 01:38.542
I'm just saying, like, he, like,
gets on me about a coffee cup.

01:38.542 --> 01:42.626
I get it.

01:42.626 --> 01:45.626
[bleep] off.
You don't have to tell me that.

01:45.626 --> 01:47.834
You're tired, I hear you,
I understand what you're saying.

01:47.834 --> 01:49.292
You hear her too, right?

01:49.292 --> 01:53.209
You know, maybe just be
a little bit gentler at times.

01:53.209 --> 01:54.709
It's his tone.

01:54.709 --> 01:56.584
He can talk to people
with some type of respect,

01:56.584 --> 01:57.584
and he doesn't do that.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.083
I'm over it.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.042
All I want is for us to
just work together harmoniously

02:01.042 --> 02:02.250
-and then let's...
-If I'm quiet, Jake--

02:02.250 --> 02:03.751
-respect that.
-Then let's...

02:03.751 --> 02:05.584
So I have nothing to do
with you, I'm just quiet.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.459
Then let's just high-five,
let's just high-five.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.083
I didn't even realize you
were being quiet or anything.

02:09.083 --> 02:10.459
I just wanted to say
about the coffee mugs.

02:10.459 --> 02:11.751
Fighting loud enough
for the guests to hear you

02:11.751 --> 02:13.250
is super unprofessional.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.083
They need to get their
sh-- together.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.083
Let's just get this job
done together, okay?

02:17.083 --> 02:21.042
We're halfway
through the season.

02:21.042 --> 02:24.000
Oh, I feel so bad,
I had a cookie.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.334
Oh, well.

02:25.334 --> 02:27.167
I think it's time for us
to go get ready.

02:27.167 --> 02:29.167
-Is it?
-Jessica said she'd do my hair.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.334
-She did?
-Mm-hmm.

02:30.334 --> 02:31.292
Let's go.

02:31.292 --> 02:33.167
-All right.
-We'll see you for dinner.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.209
All righty, I have all
the room for the platters

02:35.209 --> 02:36.375
after we serve family-style.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.501
Perfect.

02:37.501 --> 02:39.250
We're gonna have lamb,
we're gonna have fish,

02:39.250 --> 02:41.167
we're gonna have octopus.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.125
I spent a lot of time
in Greece on charter,

02:43.125 --> 02:45.959
and I've learned with
Greek culture,

02:45.959 --> 02:49.751
everyone loves to sit down at
the table, discuss, eat, share.

02:49.751 --> 02:53.792
We're gonna have the olives,
we're gonna have extra feta.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.167
And I love it.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.125
I'm all about getting
on top of a table

02:57.125 --> 02:58.501
and throwing some damn plates.

02:58.501 --> 02:59.626
Let's party!

02:59.626 --> 03:01.792
Tzaziki, hummus,
and then that's it.

03:01.792 --> 03:05.542
Beautiful.

03:05.542 --> 03:17.375
-Where's Rayna?
-I don't know.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.918
Okay.

03:18.918 --> 03:21.709
Yeah, I know.

03:21.709 --> 03:36.042
Yeah, it's okay.
We'll figure it out.

03:36.042 --> 03:37.042
-Fix this.
-All right.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.459
Make it pretty.

03:38.459 --> 03:39.834
You don't want any of
that white showing.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.334
Yeah.

03:41.334 --> 03:43.375
So tonight, you're gonna
be solely on housekeeping,

03:43.375 --> 03:45.709
and I'll have you
guest service tonight.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.417
We're gonna do the slide now.
How's that sound, y'all?

03:47.417 --> 03:56.125
Yeah.

03:56.125 --> 04:01.083
There we go.

04:01.083 --> 04:06.250
Exact... it is. No, it's not...

04:06.250 --> 04:08.417
I think Jake needs
to work on his delivery,

04:08.417 --> 04:11.167
easing into it and
not coming in so hot.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.417
-We were busting ass.
-Yeah, you think so?

04:13.417 --> 04:14.834
We... whoa.

04:14.834 --> 04:20.083
You need to move faster.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.042
But I think Rayna's
overreacting right now.

04:23.042 --> 04:27.918
Suck it up, keep going,
push through.

04:27.918 --> 04:30.042
It's not that bad.

04:30.042 --> 04:33.834
It's really not that bad.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.042
All right, cool.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.626
How you doing?
Got your costume?

04:36.626 --> 04:38.083
We need help.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.417
-Don't tip over.
-I'm not gonna tip over.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.250
Okay.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.667
Have you seen my tits?

04:41.667 --> 04:43.542
I'm not going that way,
I'll go that way first.

04:43.542 --> 04:47.709
Two, three...

04:47.709 --> 04:50.667
Mm.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.292
Hopefully.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.292
Come on, stain,
get the [bleep] out.

04:55.292 --> 04:56.751
-Throw it over your shoulder...
-You need to do...

04:56.751 --> 04:58.834
Ah, like...

04:58.834 --> 05:00.459
Love the outfits!

05:00.459 --> 05:02.125
Rachel, Heather,
we've got all the guests

05:02.125 --> 05:03.626
up here at the table now.

05:03.626 --> 05:05.626
I'm just gonna start
plating everything.

05:05.626 --> 05:06.417
Copy that.

05:06.417 --> 05:07.959
Can I offer you
some red or white?

05:07.959 --> 05:11.209
Red, thank you so much.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.000
Oh!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.375
That changes everything.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.834
Deck crew, deck crew,
change into your blacks.

05:14.834 --> 05:19.584
Copy that.

05:19.584 --> 05:21.501
Hi, Dad.

05:21.501 --> 05:26.334
So, they appointed,
like, a lead deckhand.

05:26.334 --> 05:28.501
He's scolding me over some
damn ----ing coffee mugs.

05:28.501 --> 05:30.751
But I'm irritated because
I tried to talk to

05:30.751 --> 05:34.959
my boss about it...

05:34.959 --> 05:36.792
Let me go get my blacks.

05:36.792 --> 05:41.751
I don't know, it's like I can't
go to him for no issues no more.

05:41.751 --> 05:46.667
Clearly, he's gonna side
with Jake all the time.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.709
That's what the [bleep]
I'm saying.

05:48.709 --> 05:49.918
Like, he's disrespectful.

05:49.918 --> 05:52.375
I let that sh-- slide,
and today, like,

05:52.375 --> 05:54.042
I could have maybe
overreacted just a little bit,

05:54.042 --> 05:55.501
but it's because I'm so
tired of

05:55.501 --> 05:57.584
his disrespectful, mother
----ing ass trying me.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.417
[bleep]

05:59.417 --> 06:00.959
-All right.
-All right, love you.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.918
Everyone's watered,
everyone's wined.

06:02.918 --> 06:05.125
The fish and the lamb
is ready to go.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.792
Get it the [bleep]
outta my face.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.626
So, we have some moussaka.

06:10.626 --> 06:12.751
So, this is ground, minced lamb.

06:12.751 --> 06:14.083
Smells so good.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.167
I know, doesn't it?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.292
You can smell the dill.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.918
This is your fish.

06:17.918 --> 06:19.167
Oh, it's beautiful.

06:19.167 --> 06:20.834
Would you care for
a lamb chop, sir?

06:20.834 --> 06:21.876
Yep, I'll try one.

06:21.876 --> 06:23.584
That lamb is so good.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.876
Sure it is.

06:24.876 --> 06:26.375
-Yum, yum!
-Perfect.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.209
Oh, my gosh, that fish
is so yummy.

06:28.209 --> 06:31.167
Rachel, they're absolutely
loving the meal.

06:31.167 --> 06:32.250
Thank you, thank you.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.709
What's the status on cabins?

06:33.709 --> 06:35.751
-Haven't checked.
-You've been in laundry.

06:35.751 --> 06:37.209
Oh, my God, that's so good.

06:37.209 --> 06:38.417
-How's your back?
-[bleep]

06:38.417 --> 06:45.250
Turn around.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.250
Like, the load is
just too much on all ends.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.626
It's coming to the point
of, like, a last straw.

06:51.626 --> 06:53.334
Getting to the saturation point.

06:53.334 --> 06:55.959
Think if I go change my pants,
I'll be all right.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.626
You guys don't have pants on.

06:57.626 --> 06:58.626
Oh, hell, no.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.125
This is a Greek night,

07:00.125 --> 07:01.292
they're not supposed
to have no pants on.

07:01.292 --> 07:02.751
That's what you got
a toga for.

07:02.751 --> 07:04.459
Oh, I don't wanna see
the wind over there.

07:04.459 --> 07:05.542
Yeah.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.792
Please, Dad,
don't take that off.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.209
All right, hey, you guys ready?

07:09.209 --> 07:11.167
-Yeah.
-I wanna get in the hot tub.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.209
-Eddie.
-Cap.

07:13.209 --> 07:14.792
How was the rest
of your afternoon?

07:14.792 --> 07:16.167
Pretty good.
I mean...

07:16.167 --> 07:17.792
Is your crew walking
around on eggshells?

07:17.792 --> 07:20.292
-Yes, they are.
-Good.

07:20.292 --> 07:23.667
Anything else going on
I need to know about?

07:23.667 --> 07:24.959
No.

07:24.959 --> 07:26.792
That didn't have
all your enthusiasm

07:26.792 --> 07:28.292
I would normally expect.

07:28.292 --> 07:29.709
Let me see whether
I can handle it first,

07:29.709 --> 07:30.792
unless you really wanna know.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.083
If you think you can handle it,

07:32.083 --> 07:33.250
I'm willing to give
you a free rein.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.876
-I'm good.
-Hello!

07:34.876 --> 07:38.292
I love your robe.

07:38.292 --> 07:42.250
Are they?

07:42.250 --> 07:44.709
What are you gonna put on, then?

07:44.709 --> 07:47.918
Don't let... let me turn
around, holy sh--.

07:47.918 --> 07:52.209
I don't wanna see that sh--.

07:52.209 --> 07:55.667
Two?
Perfect.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.501
This is some weird sh--.

07:57.501 --> 07:59.709
Hey, you sit over here with
your back towards me.

07:59.709 --> 08:04.417
Goddamn it, you're making
me go ----ing nuts.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.626
You know, I thought I had
a great relationship

08:06.626 --> 08:08.125
with my dad, but clearly,

08:08.125 --> 08:10.918
Nichole and her dad are
in a way more comfortable

08:10.918 --> 08:12.918
and tight relationship
than I am.

08:12.918 --> 08:15.083
Whatever floats your boat.

08:15.083 --> 08:21.584
Beautiful.
Enjoy!

08:21.584 --> 08:22.542
How you doing?

08:22.542 --> 08:25.292
-Pretty good, I'm...
-Yeah.

08:25.292 --> 08:33.167
Tired?

08:33.167 --> 08:34.792
How's your deck team doing?

08:34.792 --> 08:36.667
Rayna just gives me attitude
any time I ask her anything.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.375
Yeah.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.542
I was just concerned, because
I don't know if you knew this...

08:39.542 --> 08:41.083
my room is
right across from yours,

08:41.083 --> 08:44.709
and I want you to know
that I heard you.

08:44.709 --> 08:45.959
Coming up...

08:45.959 --> 08:51.626
Come on.

08:51.626 --> 08:54.417
A moustache ride doesn't
sound all that bad.

08:54.417 --> 08:59.667
Ah, pumpkin.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.334
that for breakfast
tomorrow, she'll love you.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.584
How about I serve her a whole
bunch of ----ing vodka,

09:03.584 --> 09:06.042
and then she'll love
me too, okay?

09:06.042 --> 09:07.250
She ain't got no top on.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.709
Oh sh--, Nikki.

09:09.709 --> 09:19.000
That's what I said!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.501
I was just concerned, because my
room is right across from yours.

09:21.501 --> 09:24.167
I heard you.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.584
I can't go to him for no issues.

09:25.584 --> 09:27.626
Clearly he's gonna side
with Jake all the time.

09:27.626 --> 09:29.501
Yeah, I heard some
very strong words.

09:29.501 --> 09:32.125
-Careful how you...
-How loud I am.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.125
-You know, talk loud.
-Yeah.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.501
Because people will hear you.

09:34.501 --> 09:36.876
I just wanna make sure
you're doing okay.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.334
and that's why I was scared...

09:38.334 --> 09:39.751
-No, no, I...
-that's why I was scared to...

09:39.751 --> 09:42.542
to say anything to you,
you know what I mean?

09:42.542 --> 09:49.375
Okay.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.667
I know, but if it's
ruining your time here,

09:50.667 --> 09:52.209
then I want you to
talk to me about it.

09:52.209 --> 09:53.751
You know, at the same time,

09:53.751 --> 09:55.751
sometimes you've just
gotta swallow your pride.

09:55.751 --> 09:57.459
And rather than try to
talk over people...

09:57.459 --> 09:59.834
which you're really good
at, by the way... listen.

09:59.834 --> 10:01.292
Yeah.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.709
But I'm here to talk,
and I'd like that

10:02.709 --> 10:04.125
you can talk to me and
be open with me, okay?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.667
-Yeah.
-That's great, and...

10:05.667 --> 10:07.542
but I want you to know
that you're awesome, okay?

10:07.542 --> 10:10.459
I just kind of laugh it off,
it was like, whatever.

10:10.459 --> 10:12.626
-You're doing a great job.
-Thank you.

10:12.626 --> 10:13.751
Stick with it, okay?

10:13.751 --> 10:17.542
-Hello.
-Hello, how you doing?

10:17.542 --> 10:19.584
Oh, so I missed out, eh?

10:19.584 --> 10:21.334
Nikki, you're too young
for me anyway, darling.

10:21.334 --> 10:23.209
Ah!

10:23.209 --> 10:33.542
-'Ello, mate.
-I've missed you.

10:33.542 --> 10:34.667
You still awake?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.250
I am, I'm just having
a quick smoke before bed.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.751
We can sit on this, can't we?

10:38.751 --> 10:41.584
So, Jess, I feel bad for her.

10:41.584 --> 10:43.751
I feel like sometimes
she's trying.

10:43.751 --> 10:45.209
I see that.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.292
But the majority
of the time it's just,

10:46.292 --> 10:47.709
I guess, not good enough.

10:47.709 --> 10:53.709
This charter...

10:53.709 --> 10:55.125
Oh, my God, what the heck?

10:55.125 --> 10:57.000
-What?
-Why are you making your drink?

10:57.000 --> 11:01.709
I'm bartender tonight.

11:01.709 --> 11:04.209
And I pulled everything
I can out of my hat

11:04.209 --> 11:06.751
to try and make things
work for Jess.

11:06.751 --> 11:08.751
No initiative, no excitement.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.918
You can only lead a horse
to water so many times.

11:11.918 --> 11:15.292
We really need someone else to
just continue plowing through.

11:15.292 --> 11:19.250
The thought of that
alone makes me tired.

11:19.250 --> 11:24.042
See ya in the morning.
Herding cattle, man.

11:24.042 --> 11:25.834
Oh, yeah.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.292
Good night.

11:27.292 --> 11:29.334
Gotta stay hydrated, you did
a whole day of drinking.

11:29.334 --> 11:30.501
I love it.

11:30.501 --> 11:31.626
Mwah, mwah.

11:31.626 --> 11:32.626
What a day.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.459
What a ----ing day.

11:34.459 --> 11:39.417
Uh-oh.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.751
[glass shatters]

11:40.751 --> 11:45.584
Uh-oh.

11:45.584 --> 11:54.042
Oh [bleep].

11:54.042 --> 11:55.375
Mwah.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.334
Morning.

11:56.334 --> 11:59.542
Rachel, I'm ready
for my morning delight.

11:59.542 --> 12:09.459
Mm-hmm, copy.

12:09.459 --> 12:11.626
Biscuits and gravy,
French toast.

12:11.626 --> 12:17.292
Whoa!

12:17.292 --> 12:19.918
It's one of those days.

12:19.918 --> 12:22.667
How are you feeling today?

12:22.667 --> 12:25.459
Yeah?

12:25.459 --> 12:26.250
Okay.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.918
-Morning.
-Morning.

12:27.918 --> 12:31.876
So this morning, Chef Rachel
has her infamous French toast.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.876
-Yeah.
-Yay!

12:32.876 --> 12:35.334
And some biscuits and gravy.

12:35.334 --> 12:37.167
-What could I get for you?
-French toast.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.667
Maybe I'll do the
biscuits and gravy,

12:38.667 --> 12:39.876
because then I'll have
a bite of...

12:39.876 --> 12:41.042
we can share, honey.

12:41.042 --> 12:42.250
I would like French toast,
please.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.501
-Beautiful.
-Where do you want me?

12:43.501 --> 12:46.375
I guess on that bed.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.375
Are you excited for a
night off this evening?

12:49.375 --> 12:52.501
Yes, I'd like
to hang out with Wes.

12:52.501 --> 12:55.292
Jessica, can I get you to
the galley for service?

12:55.292 --> 12:58.125
Copy.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.626
Ai-yi-yi.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.000
9:45 rolls around,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.375
I wanna get things kinda
covered up

13:02.375 --> 13:03.876
and get ready for
the trip across.

13:03.876 --> 13:05.042
-Okay.
-Okay.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.834
Ooh, that looks
absolutely lovely.

13:07.834 --> 13:11.292
Holy Christ, did you ask her
if she can make it any bigger?

13:11.292 --> 13:13.292
Clint, could I have
a bite of that?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.000
Mm!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.250
Oh, I'll share with Taylor.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.459
Are you...
are you...

13:17.459 --> 13:21.459
[laughing]

13:21.459 --> 13:23.959
Jess, could I get
you to the stew pantry

13:23.959 --> 13:29.125
when you have a quick second?

13:29.125 --> 13:31.334
Does it rhyme with "hoist?"

13:31.334 --> 13:32.667
I thought it was
a compliment, like...

13:32.667 --> 13:34.000
You're moist?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.584
[laughing]

13:35.584 --> 13:37.167
The reason I wanted to call
you up here I you see how,

13:37.167 --> 13:38.959
like, when
I'm clearing a service...

13:38.959 --> 13:40.334
Mm-hmm.

13:40.334 --> 13:41.959
You don't have the whole,
entire thing

13:41.959 --> 13:43.125
covered in plates with food.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.459
You can throw all
the silverware,

13:44.459 --> 13:46.542
you throw the food,
you stack the plates.

13:46.542 --> 13:47.584
I wanted to show, like,

13:47.584 --> 13:50.042
what my expectation
for clearing a service is.

13:50.042 --> 13:51.375
Yeah.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.959
Whatever.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.792
----ing suck a [bleep].

13:54.792 --> 13:57.834
If I can do this by myself,
there's no reason anyone can't.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.334
So, take note of this, and let's
try to do that moving forward.

14:00.334 --> 14:01.459
Okay. I'm gonna bring
this downstairs.

14:01.459 --> 14:02.375
Cool.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.334
You got a nice, moist
cake there, dear.

14:05.334 --> 14:06.834
Just for future reference,

14:06.834 --> 14:08.501
we can't leave all
these things on the floor

14:08.501 --> 14:10.000
when we leave a cabin, like...

14:10.000 --> 14:11.250
He came in here right away.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.501
I know, but even
if that's the case...

14:12.501 --> 14:13.667
-Okay.
-Just...

14:13.667 --> 14:15.334
let's just put it all nicely
on the bed or something.

14:15.334 --> 14:16.459
Okay.

14:16.459 --> 14:19.000
I'm just not doing anything
properly today, am I?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.501
This is bullsh--.

14:20.501 --> 14:22.626
I feel like I'm the only
one that gets spoken to,

14:22.626 --> 14:24.334
like I'm not pulling
all this weight.

14:24.334 --> 14:32.751
It can't all just be put on me.

14:32.751 --> 14:34.042
Coming up...

14:34.042 --> 14:36.292
I was less than happy
this charter.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.292
You're more than halfway
through the season,

14:38.292 --> 14:39.667
and if you don't have your
act together now,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.375
when the [bleep] are you
gonna get it together?

14:41.375 --> 14:43.417
I expect everyone
to raise their bar,

14:43.417 --> 14:56.209
and if they don't,
people will be fired.

14:56.209 --> 14:58.459
I'm sorry you feel that way,

14:58.459 --> 15:01.792
but if we can try and
stay as positive as we can,

15:01.792 --> 15:03.334
it might help.

15:03.334 --> 15:05.667
I just feel like I'm constantly
trying to play catch-up.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.334
Like, I'm not doing
it well enough,

15:07.334 --> 15:09.000
I'm not doing it quick enough.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.334
But I think it's also, like,
I don't really jibe

15:11.334 --> 15:13.083
with too many people here, so.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.334
I can understand why
that would be an issue.

15:15.334 --> 15:17.584
I just don't
like seeing you down.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.709
[sighs]

15:19.709 --> 15:21.375
Got wet swimsuits.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.209
All of mine are still wet, too.

15:23.209 --> 15:25.042
-Packing it in.
-Yeah, pack it in.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.751
Let's get outta here, Jake.

15:26.751 --> 15:27.751
Copy that.

15:27.751 --> 15:30.042
Short stay, 10:00.

15:30.042 --> 15:31.584
Anchor secured.

15:31.584 --> 15:32.792
[ship honks]

15:32.792 --> 15:33.834
Come on!

15:33.834 --> 15:45.167
[laughs]

15:45.167 --> 15:49.000
No, no, no...

15:49.000 --> 15:50.709
-Huh?
-Yeah.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.209
Yeah.

15:52.209 --> 15:53.542
It doesn't surprise me.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.417
Fraser wants to move
up in this industry,

15:55.417 --> 15:56.709
and Heather needs a minion.

15:56.709 --> 16:00.501
-I have to pee so bad.
-Go pee, love.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.417
So bad.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.751
Okay, go ahead, quickly
go get in your whites.

16:03.751 --> 16:05.167
We're having
a white docking party.

16:05.167 --> 16:11.792
Got it, got it.

16:11.792 --> 16:16.792
That's enough outta you.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.167
I want radio silence
from here on in.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.334
All right, guys,
let's start kicking

16:20.334 --> 16:21.501
them over nice and easy, okay?

16:21.501 --> 16:22.501
Yeah.

16:22.501 --> 16:24.834
-How we doing over there?
-Twenty-five, 30.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.125
Twenty-five, 30 by your
starboard side marker.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.209
Let me know when that stern
clears the dock.

16:29.209 --> 16:32.083
Rather drag my labia through
a bunch

16:32.083 --> 16:34.918
of broken tequila bottles
in Tijuana,

16:34.918 --> 16:36.834
like I've done before.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.334
Oh, my God.

16:38.334 --> 16:40.167
You're clear to start
making your swing.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.667
Twenty feet off and closing,
we're flush up and down.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.083
Looking good, Cap.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.000
That was good, huh?
Perfect!

16:46.000 --> 16:47.334
Woo!

16:47.334 --> 16:48.667
Attention all crew,
attention all crew,

16:48.667 --> 16:51.167
I need everybody on the
main deck in whites.

16:51.167 --> 16:54.209
All right, guys, come on.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.792
Get ready for guests, people.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.667
Oh, man, thank you.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.667
I appreciate everything.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.042
Oh, it's sad.

17:01.042 --> 17:02.334
Get in here.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.918
Let me get my big old boobies
on you.

17:03.918 --> 17:05.375
-Eddie.
-Hey, bud.

17:05.375 --> 17:06.542
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you too, man.

17:06.542 --> 17:07.876
Mwah!

17:07.876 --> 17:09.626
I will never forget your food
ever in my life.

17:09.626 --> 17:13.042
I appreciate everything you
guys did, it was awesome.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.667
I mean, you guys
putting up the slide

17:14.667 --> 17:16.584
was the funniest damn
thing I ever saw.

17:16.584 --> 17:18.083
-Eddie, we got an issue.
-What's that?

17:18.083 --> 17:19.334
Look at the slide.

17:19.334 --> 17:20.209
Oh, no.

17:20.209 --> 17:23.042
I bet they hate
blowing that thing up.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.584
It's taking a lot longer
than I thought.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.459
Ugh, [bleep].

17:26.459 --> 17:28.792
No kidding, it really was.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.542
It wasn't your day.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.542
Yeah, thanks, man.
Really appreciate that.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.542
Thanks for ----ing kicking
us while we're down.

17:34.542 --> 17:37.042
I mean, the service
you gave us was awesome,

17:37.042 --> 17:38.584
your meals were fantastic.

17:38.584 --> 17:40.417
It was a great time, guys,
and I appreciate it.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.000
I got something here for you.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.167
-Really, thank you.
-Thanks.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.125
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

17:45.125 --> 17:46.584
It's hard to believe it's over.

17:46.584 --> 17:48.459
-Thanks, guys.
-Bye, thank you.

17:48.459 --> 17:54.375
Thank you so much.
Safe travels.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.209
Some people should be.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.209
Okay, let's go to work.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.792
-Get in your work gear.
-Yep.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.709
Jess and Fraser if you want
to get into your blues

18:02.709 --> 18:04.292
and then we'll meet here
in the main salon.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.876
-Okay.
-Sure thing.

18:06.876 --> 18:13.292
Is he really pissed?

18:13.292 --> 18:18.209
No, certainly not.

18:18.209 --> 18:20.209
But I do wanna try to
finish by 4:00 today,

18:20.209 --> 18:22.125
so if you can finish
all those beds.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.459
Okay, sounds good.

18:23.459 --> 18:27.584
And Fraser,
to the laundry room you go.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.834
-Mm!
-Ugh.

18:29.834 --> 18:34.000
I feel so ----ing big.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.834
It's Rachel, coming in
like an enraged orangutan.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.667
-Exactly.
-Rawr!

18:40.667 --> 18:41.584
Woohoo!

18:41.584 --> 18:43.042
Hottest-looking orangutan
I ever saw.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.417
Attention all crew,

18:44.417 --> 18:46.959
I need everybody in
the crew mess in five.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.751
-Copy, Captain.
-Copy.

18:48.751 --> 18:50.417
Copy, Captain.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.459
The deck team needs a wake-up
call, and I'm gonna deliver it.

18:53.459 --> 18:55.959
You'd think that after
all this time

18:55.959 --> 18:57.375
we could get one charter right.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.834
You're more than halfway
through the season,

18:58.834 --> 19:00.709
and if you don't have
your act together now,

19:00.709 --> 19:02.375
when the [bleep] are you
gonna get it together?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.834
Is it just me, or
do you feel like

19:04.834 --> 19:08.542
a volcano is about to erupt?

19:08.542 --> 19:10.334
Let's see, where do I wanna sit,
directly across from him?

19:10.334 --> 19:13.042
Mm, probably not.

19:13.042 --> 19:21.584
Get in here with me.

19:21.584 --> 19:25.417
I was less than happy
this charter.

19:25.417 --> 19:26.667
Your food was great, as usual.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.959
Thank you.

19:27.959 --> 19:31.167
I was pleased to see proper
service etiquette at the table.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.709
But deck crew,
I expect everyone

19:33.709 --> 19:39.334
to raise their bar, and if they
don't, people will be gone.

19:39.334 --> 19:45.083
Work hard, work smart,
or get fired.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.501
We're over halfway
through the season

19:48.501 --> 19:50.667
and we're
still making rookie mistakes,

19:50.667 --> 19:54.167
and it showed in
the money department.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.417
Our tip's 19,000.

19:56.417 --> 19:59.751
The tip's ----ing low, and
I'm kinda ticked the [bleep] off

19:59.751 --> 20:01.459
about it, because I wanted
to go for 30.

20:01.459 --> 20:04.250
If I'm not getting
any Goddamn sleep, I want 30.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.876
We need to improve.

20:05.876 --> 20:10.626
Deck crew, I wanna see you in
the wheelhouse in five minutes.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.000
And don't bring your smiles,
you won't be needing them.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.876
Thank you, Captain.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.667
The deck team
really ----ed up.

20:19.667 --> 20:22.834
I'm just ashamed
of the job we did.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.167
I feel like everyone's a little
bit on edge at the moment.

20:25.167 --> 20:29.334
I do, too.

20:29.334 --> 20:37.667
Wherever you're gonna feel
the most uncomfortable.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.250
That tip sucked.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.751
I'm disappointed.

20:41.751 --> 20:43.417
And what was the first thing
the charter guest

20:43.417 --> 20:45.375
mentioned when
he got off the boat?

20:45.375 --> 20:46.417
The slide.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.918
The [bleep] up with the slide.

20:47.918 --> 20:49.626
He thought it was comical
'cause y'all looked

20:49.626 --> 20:53.876
like three cub bears trying
to [bleep] a football.

20:53.876 --> 20:55.584
The bar's up here;

20:55.584 --> 20:57.417
you guys are down here...
way down here.

20:57.417 --> 21:00.626
If we [bleep] up that slide
one more Goddamn time,

21:00.626 --> 21:02.459
I'm gonna have somebody's ass,

21:02.459 --> 21:03.876
and I don't care
if it's one, two...

21:03.876 --> 21:07.292
I don't care if
it's all four of you.

21:07.292 --> 21:09.334
I'll cancel the rest
of the Goddamn season.

21:09.334 --> 21:09.334
This is your final wake-up call.

21:09.334 --> 21:17.626
I'm sorry you feel that way,

21:17.626 --> 21:20.459
This is your final wake-up call.

21:20.459 --> 21:23.709
I wanna see people
being proactive.

21:23.709 --> 21:25.417
I want you to anticipate.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.083
It either happens
on this charter

21:27.083 --> 21:28.918
or people are gonna
lose their job.

21:28.918 --> 21:32.876
There are no more
second chances.

21:32.876 --> 21:39.375
Okay, carry on.

21:39.375 --> 21:40.709
Wes and Rayna,
please go wash the bow.

21:40.709 --> 21:42.375
Captain Lee is pissed.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.209
I haven't seen him this angry
in a long time,

21:44.209 --> 21:46.709
if ever,
and it's embarrassing.

21:46.709 --> 21:48.584
All right, start off
rinsing the wall.

21:48.584 --> 21:49.501
Yeah.

21:49.501 --> 21:51.292
I just feel like I
let Captain Lee down.

21:51.292 --> 21:53.209
You know, I'm not
really proud of myself.

21:53.209 --> 21:56.501
Start rinsing, start washing.

21:56.501 --> 21:58.876
I think regardless if the world
is tumbling around us,

21:58.876 --> 22:00.626
why don't you and I
have a ----ing good time?

22:00.626 --> 22:01.542
I think we need to.

22:01.542 --> 22:06.042
Like, I wanna have
a proper good time.

22:06.042 --> 22:14.834
Interior crew, we can knock off
for the day, thank you guys.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.501
Did you hit the skis as well?

22:16.501 --> 22:19.125
Ugh, I'm not a dodo bird.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.959
I wanna work,
and I wanna do...

22:20.959 --> 22:22.751
I know you do. I know.
Listen, I see what you can do.

22:22.751 --> 22:24.876
I just don't know how
to tell them anything.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.751
-You just can't.
-Eddie, Eddie, Rayna.

22:26.751 --> 22:28.375
What stainless needs
to be wiped down?

22:28.375 --> 22:30.000
All of the stainless
on main deck aft.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.334
Copy.

22:38.334 --> 22:39.709
Still talking to yourself?

22:39.709 --> 22:41.209
Weird.

22:41.209 --> 22:44.125
It's like you'd be very
good at monologues.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.459
Female equivalent
of Morgan Freeman.

22:45.459 --> 22:48.000
[laughing]

22:48.000 --> 22:51.042
You guys are in a good mood.

22:51.042 --> 22:54.417
Okay, good.

22:54.417 --> 22:59.584
Deck team, deck team,
you can knock off.

22:59.584 --> 23:02.250
No, actually, you
know what it is?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.375
It's the ----ing hummus.
Smell that sh--, dude.

23:04.375 --> 23:05.709
-Ooh, yeah.
-Yeah.

23:05.709 --> 23:19.501
It's like that peppery,
salt-and-vinegary...

23:19.501 --> 23:24.125
I gotta do something
with my hair.

23:24.125 --> 23:25.209
Oh, hello.

23:25.209 --> 23:26.876
-You look nice.
-And so do you.

23:26.876 --> 23:28.292
I like Jess.

23:28.292 --> 23:29.751
I think she's cute,
I think she's cool.

23:29.751 --> 23:31.417
Now it feels like
I'm in high school

23:31.417 --> 23:32.417
and I have a crush on somebody.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.334
Oh, I ----ing love those.

23:34.334 --> 23:44.209
Tonight, I'm waiting
for the signal.

23:44.209 --> 23:48.000
Will you help me feel pretty?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.751
Oh, my eyes! Oh!

23:49.751 --> 23:51.042
Hey there, sweetheart.

23:51.042 --> 23:52.250
-So do you.
-You look like a girl dad.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.501
A girl dad?
No.

23:53.501 --> 23:54.834
All right, you guys,
ready to go?

23:54.834 --> 23:57.000
Cool.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.751
Ooh!

23:58.751 --> 24:00.000
You're gonna watch your step,
you're gonna take your time on.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.876
Thank you.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.834
Oh, this is very relaxing.

24:07.834 --> 24:11.375
She's got...
she's got character.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.209
I think they will.

24:13.209 --> 24:15.375
Ha ha, that's it.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.083
-Who farted?
-Not me.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.751
Oh, wow, this looks lovely.

24:19.751 --> 24:22.125
Let's just go and have
a drink at the bar.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.459
Thank you very much.

24:24.459 --> 24:26.959
I'll take a Vicodin.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.000
I would love a Tito's soda.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm going to get
one of those.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.125
That's a lot of Tito's.

24:31.125 --> 24:35.834
Oh, that's all the Tito's?

24:35.834 --> 24:37.167
I have resting sad face.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.626
I don't know what people
want from me.

24:38.626 --> 24:40.167
-You do not.
-And it's not that I'm sad.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.751
I don't think
I've seen that face.

24:41.751 --> 24:43.834
It's because I'm always
trying to be nice to you.

24:43.834 --> 24:46.667
-Oh... mm.
-Hm.

24:46.667 --> 24:47.626
Where's Jess and Wes?

24:47.626 --> 24:49.000
They're having a
chitty-chat-chat-chat.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.709
Ooh!

24:50.709 --> 24:52.918
What do you think, think we're
gonna get a day off eventually?

24:52.918 --> 25:00.292
No.

25:00.292 --> 25:07.918
-I make the most of it.
-Make the most of it.

25:07.918 --> 25:10.542
Your table is ready.
Can I take you to it?

25:10.542 --> 25:14.542
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, let's do it.

25:14.542 --> 25:15.709
-Oh, thank you, darling.
-Cheers, bro.

25:15.709 --> 25:16.667
Cheers, babe.

25:16.667 --> 25:22.417
This is just straight
vodka, basically.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.083
Let me get
the goat cheese salad?

25:24.083 --> 25:26.876
I'm gonna do the
mixed green salad.

25:26.876 --> 25:35.375
The steak, well-done.

25:35.375 --> 25:36.876
-Yeah.
-Here you are.

25:36.876 --> 25:39.375
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.250
Mm!

25:40.250 --> 25:41.501
I just wanna feed you.

25:41.501 --> 25:45.501
Mm!

25:45.501 --> 25:47.417
Here's a good story.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.334
In my first week in yachting
in the South of France,

25:49.334 --> 25:51.501
ended up sleeping
with one of the stews.

25:51.501 --> 25:54.626
We ----ed on one of the
guests' Louis Vuitton bags.

25:54.626 --> 25:56.542
The next day, we had to go up
to the bridge,

25:56.542 --> 26:00.250
and the captain's like, "Jake,
you slept with one of the stews,

26:00.250 --> 26:02.626
and I ----ing told you
not to do that."

26:02.626 --> 26:06.167
But then he just starts
----ing cracking up.

26:06.167 --> 26:08.417
Hashtag white privilege.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.959
Boy, tomorrow's gonna
be such a day.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.292
We're putting up and down
the slide tomorrow.

26:12.292 --> 26:13.959
-Why?
-To get it right.

26:13.959 --> 26:16.751
Hey, cheers to a beautiful boss.

26:16.751 --> 26:18.042
Cheers these guys.

26:18.042 --> 26:19.417
Cheers, guys.

26:19.417 --> 26:22.083
Goddamn it, this is
dripping all over me.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.250
Should we move outside?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.751
Yeah, let's do it.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.542
I would love to sit on
one of those comfy chairs,

26:26.542 --> 26:28.417
but it's like,
where's the fire pit?

26:28.417 --> 26:31.042
Piss off, this one's mine...
piss off!

26:31.042 --> 26:35.209
[bleep] off!

26:35.209 --> 26:36.209
Can I get in the middle?

26:36.209 --> 26:37.459
Yeah, baby.

26:37.459 --> 26:38.876
[bleep] yeah, mother----ers.

26:38.876 --> 26:48.667
Fetal position and die.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.167
I got no juice.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.250
Oh, no, wait,
wait, wait, you're on my dress.

26:52.250 --> 26:59.584
I have safety pins on it.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.918
We know you got a boyfriend.

27:00.918 --> 27:07.083
Well, I don't think
she does...

27:07.083 --> 27:09.584
Because you've got a fiancÃ©
and I've got a boyfriend.

27:09.584 --> 27:10.959
You never told me
you have a boyfriend.

27:10.959 --> 27:14.042
-Oh sh--dick.
-You didn't mention him before.

27:14.042 --> 27:15.334
I've mentioned him
to the other crewmembers.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.876
You've never asked.

27:16.876 --> 27:19.459
I think Jake is so great,
I really do.

27:19.459 --> 27:22.959
If I was five years younger
in my party-[bleep]-it phase,

27:22.959 --> 27:24.542
and if I wasn't taken,

27:24.542 --> 27:32.834
a moustache ride
doesn't sound all that bad.

27:32.834 --> 27:43.584
Ah, pumpkin.

27:43.584 --> 27:46.042
I've been single
for three years I think now.

27:46.042 --> 27:48.292
-Three years?
-I think it's three.

27:48.292 --> 27:52.667
I stopped counting.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.459
I keep feeling like
he wants to kiss me,

27:54.459 --> 27:57.501
but he's expecting
me to kiss him.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.083
So, it's like this
little awkward,

27:59.083 --> 28:01.918
like, little thing
that's going on.

28:01.918 --> 28:05.918
Wes could be on island time,
a little bit, but just do it.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.876
I've hung out with my
grandparents for my entire life.

28:08.876 --> 28:11.083
I'm good with just them.

28:11.083 --> 28:16.626
Tired, I think we're all tired.

28:16.626 --> 28:32.000
Bitchy makeup,
we're here.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.209
I left my purse in there.

28:37.209 --> 28:38.667
I just need to find my purse.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.167
It's over here.

28:40.167 --> 28:41.375
I thought so.

28:41.375 --> 28:41.375
Hey!

28:41.375 --> 28:48.501
This is your final wake-up call.

28:48.501 --> 28:51.834
Are we leaving?

28:51.834 --> 28:55.125
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.459
It's just like this.

28:56.459 --> 28:57.876
Oh, my God, should we
squish Rayna in here

28:57.876 --> 28:59.626
so they have their own car,
Wes and Jess?

28:59.626 --> 29:01.209
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:01.209 --> 29:02.459
Rayna!

29:02.459 --> 29:04.501
We're gonna let
Wes and Jess have a car.

29:04.501 --> 29:08.250
Yeah!

29:08.250 --> 29:10.292
Oh, yeah, we definitely
got this to ourselves.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.709
Oh [bleep] yes!

29:11.709 --> 29:13.209
We should have a song
that we always sing

29:13.209 --> 29:14.918
every time we go out
and we get drunk.

29:14.918 --> 29:17.918
â™ª You insane kids
'bout to make them tips â™ª

29:17.918 --> 29:27.167
â™ª Breakin' it down,
we're slow and low â™ª

29:27.167 --> 29:31.167
[chattering]

29:31.167 --> 29:33.083
I just wanna go home
and smoke a joint.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.459
Oh, God.

29:34.459 --> 29:36.042
How was everyone's drive?

29:36.042 --> 29:37.292
Come on in, folks.

29:37.292 --> 29:39.959
Watch me run to my bed,
hee hee... bye!

29:39.959 --> 29:42.834
Hey.

29:42.834 --> 29:49.250
Good night.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.584
Did I kiss Wes?

29:50.584 --> 29:51.751
You did.

29:51.751 --> 29:55.125
I think I just gave him a peck
o the cheek to go to sleep.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.209
I mean, that was hardly a kiss.

29:57.209 --> 30:00.709
Um...

30:00.709 --> 30:04.083
Oh...

30:04.083 --> 30:05.834
â™ª Bed time

30:05.834 --> 30:07.292
â™ª Bed time

30:07.292 --> 30:14.250
â™ª Hey, ho, drop that
sh-- till it float â™ª

30:14.250 --> 30:15.584
-What was it?
-What was it?

30:15.584 --> 30:23.792
Real sh--, no.

30:23.792 --> 30:24.959
That's cancel culture,
better be careful

30:24.959 --> 30:26.459
when you say the "N" word.

30:26.459 --> 30:29.209
-What do you mean?
-They'll cancel you so hard.

30:29.209 --> 30:31.250
And no... and, like,
you can't say that.

30:31.250 --> 30:37.083
You can't.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.459
I don't... I...
I mean...

30:39.459 --> 30:40.751
I like you, but just, like,
you gotta be careful,

30:40.751 --> 30:43.751
because people...
you know how people are.

30:43.751 --> 30:49.125
2021... it's not 2002
anymore, you know?

30:49.125 --> 30:51.501
I didn't think I said it.

30:51.501 --> 30:56.918
You said it in
the bathroom today.

30:56.918 --> 30:58.417
That's okay, I still love you.

30:58.417 --> 31:00.250
I'm just... I'm telling
you, just be careful.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, I can respect that,
thank you.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.667
I got you.
I got you.

31:05.667 --> 31:06.417
Mm-hmm.

31:06.417 --> 31:09.250
-[bleep]
-Better drink it, bitch.

31:09.250 --> 31:18.083
Drink it, drink it, drink it.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.334
You have got your
tank top in my room.

31:20.334 --> 31:21.584
Yeah, I'm gonna go out.

31:21.584 --> 31:23.876
Why?

31:23.876 --> 31:28.542
Because.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.667
No.

31:30.667 --> 31:31.542
I'm in shock.

31:31.542 --> 31:57.918
I don't even remember
saying that.

31:57.918 --> 31:59.751
Oh!

31:59.751 --> 32:05.751
I don't know whose this is,
but it's [bleep] in the way.

32:05.751 --> 32:07.876
I don't want to be,
like, the angry person,

32:07.876 --> 32:09.876
but I think what bothers me
that I'm supposed to work with

32:09.876 --> 32:12.584
these people who think
this sh--'s okay.

32:12.584 --> 32:14.584
She thought it was cool,
and it hurts me.

32:14.584 --> 32:18.083
It hurts my heart,
it hurts everything in me.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.584
Morning.

32:19.584 --> 32:21.167
We're gonna put the slide up
right now.

32:21.167 --> 32:22.751
The biggest issues we're
having, obviously,

32:22.751 --> 32:25.250
is the foot coming down
and getting out properly.

32:25.250 --> 32:29.000
So what I'm thinking is if we're
able to drop it down to here,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.250
and then have you guys
inflate as much as you can,

32:32.250 --> 32:34.375
I think that might
be the best way.

32:34.375 --> 32:35.584
Okay, let's do this thing.

32:35.584 --> 32:36.709
Let's do it!

32:36.709 --> 32:39.751
I want the deck team
to step it up

32:39.751 --> 32:41.751
and to get their job dialed in.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.417
Our asses are on the line.

32:43.417 --> 32:45.375
You got to pull it together.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.375
All right, dropping over
the first flake now.

32:47.375 --> 32:48.959
Good morning, Captain,
how are you?

32:48.959 --> 32:50.209
Good.

32:50.209 --> 32:51.375
Thank you very much.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.584
-I love it.
-Feels good.

32:53.584 --> 32:54.959
Okay, one more flake,
let's see where it lands.

32:54.959 --> 32:58.167
Ready?
One, two, three.

32:58.167 --> 33:02.042
Don't waste time doing vacuum
on anything above the floor.

33:02.042 --> 33:03.334
Perfect, now you can stop.

33:03.334 --> 33:05.250
We are going to start inflating.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.459
Am I good to let this unroll
and keep going?

33:06.459 --> 33:07.250
Yes.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.459
Copy that.

33:09.459 --> 33:12.876
Do we need any ginger or
turmeric? No.

33:12.876 --> 33:14.918
Faster. Faster.

33:14.918 --> 33:21.584
It's taking way too long.

33:21.584 --> 33:23.417
-It's looking pretty good.
-All right, copy that.

33:23.417 --> 33:25.751
That took us over an hour.

33:25.751 --> 33:27.584
But hey, yeah,
we got it worked out.

33:27.584 --> 33:30.584
No lives lost, no wrong bends.

33:30.584 --> 33:32.375
-We're good, I think.
-Yeah.

33:32.375 --> 33:35.167
Eddie, Rachel, Heather, I need
you in the crew mess

33:35.167 --> 33:37.334
immediately for
a preference sheet meeting.

33:37.334 --> 33:40.000
-Copy.
-Copy.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.959
-Hello.
-Hi, sweet pea!

33:41.959 --> 33:45.209
So, here we go, number five.

33:45.209 --> 33:48.751
Co-primary, Chelsea and
Michael Gonella,

33:48.751 --> 33:50.542
a San Francisco-based couple

33:50.542 --> 33:52.709
who are obsessed
with travel and food.

33:52.709 --> 33:55.083
But due to
a recent bicycle accident,

33:55.083 --> 33:57.250
co-primary Chelsea will
be coming aboard

33:57.250 --> 34:00.250
with her jaw wired shut

34:00.250 --> 34:03.167
and will be unable to
consume any solid foods.

34:03.167 --> 34:07.792
I don't think I could handle
having my mouth wired shut.

34:07.792 --> 34:09.584
I think within, like,
the first couple days

34:09.584 --> 34:11.834
I'd have some wire clippers
going to it, you know?

34:11.834 --> 34:14.209
Because I can't
keep my mouth shut.

34:14.209 --> 34:15.584
Dinner first night,

34:15.584 --> 34:18.042
your version of traditional
Cetacean dishes.

34:18.042 --> 34:19.334
[bleep]

34:19.334 --> 34:21.375
They wanna do a silent
disco beach party.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.209
I love silent disco!

34:23.209 --> 34:25.375
And dinner night two,
black and gold...

34:25.375 --> 34:26.667
-Hot tub.
-Glam party.

34:26.667 --> 34:27.709
Glam party.

34:27.709 --> 34:30.375
So, we'll have to get
her a birthday straw.

34:30.375 --> 34:33.417
I'm outta here.

34:33.417 --> 34:34.751
You have a
good night last night?

34:34.751 --> 34:36.417
Oh...

34:36.417 --> 34:38.584
I did, I was just so tired, man.

34:38.584 --> 34:39.584
I know.

34:39.584 --> 34:42.000
Were you able to get some
alone time with Wes?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.209
Yeah.

34:43.209 --> 34:44.334
He's super nice.

34:44.334 --> 34:46.918
He is lovely, isn't he?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.125
-No.
-Like, I'm...

34:48.125 --> 34:49.125
-I'm...
-I didn't think so.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.542
I'm used to...

34:50.542 --> 34:52.000
I'm used to men who are
a little bit more suave.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.667
Yeah.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.125
But I mean, does he think
anything romantic's going on?

34:55.125 --> 34:56.334
I don't know.

34:56.334 --> 34:57.459
What's going on
with you and Jess?

34:57.459 --> 34:58.792
You didn't kiss her or anything?

34:58.792 --> 34:59.959
Yeah, what the [bleep]
is wrong with you?

34:59.959 --> 35:00.959
She was ready for it.

35:00.959 --> 35:02.167
Yeah, I was confused about that.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.167
Nothing was insinuated
though, was it?

35:03.167 --> 35:04.626
Maybe.

35:04.626 --> 35:06.792
What?
What do you mean?

35:06.792 --> 35:07.709
I don't know.

35:07.709 --> 35:09.667
-Well, what happened?
-Like... nothing.

35:09.667 --> 35:10.876
-Did something happen?
-Nothing happened.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.626
It was ----ing weird.

35:12.626 --> 35:14.876
You just have to
lean in and just...

35:14.876 --> 35:19.000
Yeah.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.667
Look at that.

35:20.667 --> 35:22.209
-Eddie, Eddie, Lee.
-Go for Eddie.

35:22.209 --> 35:23.751
Yeah, you wanna
come up the wheelhouse?

35:23.751 --> 35:25.083
On my way.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.459
Dark chocolate-covered
raspberries...

35:26.459 --> 35:28.417
that's gonna be the Tits McGee.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.918
I'll rip out my
sweater puppets for those.

35:30.918 --> 35:31.918
What are sweater puppets?

35:31.918 --> 35:33.292
Those are tits.

35:33.292 --> 35:41.167
-I didn't know that!
-Yeah.

35:41.167 --> 35:42.334
What's up?

35:42.334 --> 35:44.334
Jesus Christ, look at this?

35:44.334 --> 35:45.918
-What, water spots?
-Yeah.

35:45.918 --> 35:47.000
They just rinsed it.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.250
-Look at this.
-Oh, yeah.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.834
I mean, seriously?

35:49.834 --> 35:53.125
Wes and Rayna, they said they
washed everything up here.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.959
This looks like sh--.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.417
Eddie's not handling this well.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.250
The work should have
been double-checked.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.250
That's why you got
three stripes.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.751
That's even glistening.

36:02.751 --> 36:03.709
It's caked on.

36:03.709 --> 36:05.751
Brand new ----ing skis,
and look at 'em.

36:05.751 --> 36:08.459
-I want everything scrubbed.
-Okay.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.834
Eddie needs to get control
of his deck team yesterday,

36:10.834 --> 36:13.125
or I'm gonna start handing
out plane tickets.

36:13.125 --> 36:17.667
One way, compliments of
Captain Lee's Travel Agency.

36:17.667 --> 36:17.667
This is bullsh--.

36:17.667 --> 36:23.667
Are we leaving?

36:23.667 --> 36:26.876
Wes and Rayna, they said they
washed everything up here.

36:26.876 --> 36:28.000
This looks like [bleep].

36:28.000 --> 36:29.334
I want everything scrubbed.

36:29.334 --> 36:30.834
-Okay.
-This is bullsh--.

36:30.834 --> 36:33.501
I'm getting frustrated,
because their mistakes

36:33.501 --> 36:34.709
are reflecting poorly on me.

36:34.709 --> 36:39.125
I gotta ----ing
come down on these guys.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.626
I think that for
our last charter,

36:40.626 --> 36:43.751
we should have just had smokin'
hot titties for dinner.

36:43.751 --> 36:51.459
Just put some smoke in there
and be like, whoosh.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.083
I've seen a bit too much
of this room today.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.083
Well, you made it
very nice in here.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.709
Thank you.

36:57.709 --> 36:59.542
Wes, the stairs have still
got loads of, like, bugs on.

36:59.542 --> 37:01.042
Can you just give them a mop?

37:01.042 --> 37:03.375
-Will do.
-Cheers.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.626
-Chef Rachel...
-Yes?

37:04.626 --> 37:06.000
Is there anything
I can help you with?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.626
No, sweetheart,
I'm closing shop right now.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.876
I need to talk to you and Wes.

37:08.876 --> 37:10.459
What happened?

37:10.459 --> 37:12.542
Well, we're gonna talk
about it, aren't we?

37:12.542 --> 37:15.417
Oh, God.

37:15.417 --> 37:18.125
You guys said you did the rescue
tender and the jet-skis.

37:18.125 --> 37:20.459
Well, Captain Lee went up
and saw your handiwork...

37:20.459 --> 37:22.792
-God.
-and is pissed.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.125
-There's salt over everything.
-Sorry...

37:25.125 --> 37:26.542
Wait, gimme a second,
let me finish.

37:26.542 --> 37:29.209
Ugh, you know what,
Eddie, aka Jimmy Neutron,

37:29.209 --> 37:30.834
not in the mood right now.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.083
I've been working my ass
off all day.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.667
I'm just over it.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.709
Now, you guys have
to get up early in the morning

37:35.709 --> 37:36.334
and get it done.

37:36.334 --> 37:38.250
Is there something wrong?

37:38.250 --> 37:39.459
No, I never said anything.

37:39.459 --> 37:40.876
No, you don't have
to say anything

37:40.876 --> 37:42.375
if your eyes roll off
the back of your head.

37:42.375 --> 37:43.626
I told you, it has nothing
to do with you.

37:43.626 --> 37:46.459
-Okay. Thank you guys.
-Thanks, Eddie.

37:46.459 --> 37:51.834
This is some bullsh--.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.375
That's something that ain't
getting talked about.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.459
What, when?

37:54.459 --> 37:55.626
Yes, I'm just tired.

37:55.626 --> 37:56.459
I...

37:56.459 --> 37:58.000
Like, I really need
a ----ing break.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.334
-Wait... what? What?
-Yeah. Yeah.

37:59.334 --> 38:00.542
You... well, you didn't
tell me that.

38:00.542 --> 38:01.792
-When'd that happen?
-Yeah.

38:01.792 --> 38:03.000
But they out there
kiki-ing and stuff.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.209
-What?
-Yeah.

38:04.209 --> 38:05.751
So tired of this sh--.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.876
When? Where?

38:06.876 --> 38:10.250
Can you just help me clean this
up so we can be done?

38:10.250 --> 38:14.959
I really don't wanna talk.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.501
-You look great.
-T
hanks.

38:16.501 --> 38:18.334
I've been looking like
a hot mess.

38:18.334 --> 38:19.792
I don't even wear any makeup.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.834
It's so busy
and it's so stressful,

38:21.834 --> 38:25.250
so I think I just forgot
how much work it was.

38:25.250 --> 38:27.876
I have innate guilt
all the time, like,

38:27.876 --> 38:30.334
I have to keep working, I have
to be here, I have to do this.

38:30.334 --> 38:31.959
I don't wanna let people down.

38:31.959 --> 38:35.000
But I've never been on a
charter that runs this fast.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.292
I'm having a hard time.

38:36.292 --> 38:37.459
Yeah, I have to go to bed.

38:37.459 --> 38:40.250
-Okay.
-Love you, goodbye.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.542
-Hey, boo.
-You wanna smoke a ciggie?

38:41.542 --> 38:42.417
Yeah, now.

38:42.417 --> 38:44.918
Oh [bleep] me running
with a chainsaw.

38:44.918 --> 38:47.042
I need to get Eddie so I can
talk to him after this.

38:47.042 --> 38:48.501
What happened?

38:48.501 --> 38:50.209
I think he feels like
I was being disrespectful.

38:50.209 --> 38:53.375
I kinda rolled my eyes,
and he was, like, upset.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.375
In his eyes,
we [bleep] up ever day.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.417
How did Rayna react?

38:56.417 --> 38:58.042
It did not seem good.

38:58.042 --> 38:59.709
-She's pissed off...
-It's some childish sh--.

38:59.709 --> 39:09.042
She was rolling her eyes
at me and it's not cool.

39:09.042 --> 39:17.083
When?

39:17.083 --> 39:20.250
Okay.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.626
I know, darling.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.626
You know sometimes when
you're frustrated

39:22.626 --> 39:23.876
everything could bother you?

39:23.876 --> 39:25.459
Yeah.

39:25.459 --> 39:26.751
There are certain things, like
what you just mentioned to me...

39:26.751 --> 39:27.918
Yeah.

39:27.918 --> 39:29.918
Which I think you have every
right to be bothered by...

39:29.918 --> 39:31.083
-And then I come back, and I...
-So that, you should voice.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.125
Yeah.

39:32.125 --> 39:33.584
And you should voice
to Eddie

39:33.584 --> 39:34.751
that you didn't mean
to come across that way.

39:34.751 --> 39:36.209
Across that way.
No, I'm going to.

39:36.209 --> 39:39.918
That's what I'm gonna tell him.

39:39.918 --> 39:43.167
Ooh.

39:43.167 --> 39:44.876
[knocking]

39:44.876 --> 39:46.667
-Yep?
-Can I come in?

39:46.667 --> 39:47.918
Yep.

39:47.918 --> 39:56.250
Eddie...

39:56.250 --> 39:57.584
I appreciate you realize that,

39:57.584 --> 39:58.834
and thank you for
coming to talk to me.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.375
It's... we're good.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.626
And I think I'm frustrated
with, like, kind of...

40:01.626 --> 40:02.918
I get it, I know
you're frustrated.

40:02.918 --> 40:04.584
You've got great
organizational skills.

40:04.584 --> 40:05.626
Yeah.

40:05.626 --> 40:07.417
You handled the slide
really well this morning,

40:07.417 --> 40:08.834
but missed big things
that needed to get done.

40:08.834 --> 40:10.918
-It's not okay, though.
-It's not okay.

40:10.918 --> 40:12.584
It's physically not okay.

40:12.584 --> 40:13.584
It's not okay, and I'm
sure that I'm gonna have

40:13.584 --> 40:14.584
to have other talks with you...

40:14.584 --> 40:20.042
-Yes.
-Just please...

40:20.042 --> 40:21.209
Take your face off.

40:21.209 --> 40:22.959
-Exactly, you know?
-Yeah.

40:22.959 --> 40:24.792
That's something I've gotten
in trouble with my parents

40:24.792 --> 40:26.042
since the ----ing
beginning of time.

40:26.042 --> 40:27.542
Yeah.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.209
So when you said that, man,
I'm like [bleep].

40:29.209 --> 40:31.709
I'm so sorry about that.

40:31.709 --> 40:34.584
If you ever do that
to Captain Lee...

40:34.584 --> 40:36.000
-I'm ----ed.
-You're ----ed.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.375
You're gone.
You're gone.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.709
You might as well just
pack your sh-- up, yeah.

40:39.709 --> 40:40.751
All right.

40:40.751 --> 40:44.375
And just I...
and I think I'm, like, trying...

40:44.375 --> 40:50.751
like, I think I'm already
frustrated on another level.

40:50.751 --> 40:51.959
I can understand that.

40:51.959 --> 40:53.501
I did not hear her say that,

40:53.501 --> 40:55.125
and I would have not been
okay with her saying that.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.667
I know you weren't there,
but, like, Jake was there...

40:56.667 --> 40:57.918
Well, I was in the...
I was in the car.

40:57.918 --> 40:59.083
No, it wasn't in the car.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.209
Oh, it wasn't in the car, okay.

41:00.209 --> 41:01.459
It was once in the restaurant.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.042
And then I told her, like...

41:03.042 --> 41:04.250
No, you can't say those things.

41:04.250 --> 41:05.626
You need to take
care of yourself,

41:05.626 --> 41:07.417
and you need to stand up
for yourself when need be.

41:07.417 --> 41:09.501
But when it comes down to
just getting the job done...

41:09.501 --> 41:10.626
Yeah.

41:10.626 --> 41:12.459
That's what this is about,
is getting the job done.

41:12.459 --> 41:13.459
Yeah.

41:13.459 --> 41:15.250
Try to separate
what's happening personally

41:15.250 --> 41:16.459
with what's happening on deck.

41:16.459 --> 41:17.959
-It's a lot.
-Yeah.

41:17.959 --> 41:21.167
And you have the potential
to move up in rank, Rayna.

41:21.167 --> 41:23.292
You have it.
You just need to focus.

41:23.292 --> 41:25.501
-Yeah.
-Focus.

41:25.501 --> 41:26.792
And don't take things
personally.

41:26.792 --> 41:28.501
Yeah, I don't think
the way you...

41:28.501 --> 41:30.042
like, I feel like the
way you talk to us,

41:30.042 --> 41:31.417
I don't take anything personal.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.709
I think you do it in
a very proactive way,

41:33.709 --> 41:35.584
even though, you know
what I mean, like...

41:35.584 --> 41:37.334
-Yeah.
-It's a very positive way.

41:37.334 --> 41:39.083
Like, even though you're coming
down on us, you still...

41:39.083 --> 41:41.584
it's still, like, a...
you know what I mean?

41:41.584 --> 41:43.709
I don't wanna...
like, I don't wanna be a dick.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.626
-A dick, yeah.
-I don't wanna be...

41:45.626 --> 41:46.918
like, I don't like
being a dick.

41:46.918 --> 41:48.709
-Yeah.
-But I can be one.

41:48.709 --> 41:49.751
Can be one.

41:49.751 --> 41:50.751
-----ing hell!
-Right?

41:50.751 --> 41:52.334
-Thanks, Ed.
-Yep.

41:52.334 --> 41:53.667
-Edward.
-I'll talk to you later.

41:53.667 --> 42:02.918
Talk to you.

42:02.918 --> 42:05.375
Oh, my God.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.083
Next, on "Below Deck"...

42:07.083 --> 42:09.417
Hello!

42:09.417 --> 42:15.083
Did I mention you have a lady
with her jaw wired shut?

42:15.083 --> 42:34.000
Ugh, why tonight, why?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.626
Gets you going, huh?
Oh, yeah.

42:35.626 --> 42:38.334
You play this whole nice
guy act, but in reality,

42:38.334 --> 42:40.334
you're just a plain
old freak, aren't you?

42:40.334 --> 42:41.709
How are you doing?

42:41.709 --> 42:43.000
Good, can you and I
have a chat privately?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.709
Sure.

42:44.709 --> 42:46.083
Sh--.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.876
-Whoa.
-Oh, my God.

42:47.876 --> 42:49.083
Something gone missing?

42:49.083 --> 42:50.125
Oh, wow.

42:50.125 --> 42:51.334
Everything is going wrong.

42:51.334 --> 42:52.792
It back-clipped
on itself.

42:52.792 --> 42:54.459
Thirty-five years,
I've never seen it.

42:54.459 --> 42:55.709
I watched it fall off.

42:55.709 --> 42:56.959
That's bullsh--.

42:56.959 --> 42:58.667
I'll go to bat for you guys,

42:58.667 --> 43:02.667
but don't put my ----ing head
on a Goddamn chopping block.
