00:10.936 --> 00:12.085
<i>- Stop.</i>

00:12.162 --> 00:13.754
<i>Change view.</i>

00:13.830 --> 00:15.505
<i>No good.</i>

00:15.582 --> 00:16.682
<i>Him?</i>

00:19.669 --> 00:20.844
<i>Good.</i>

00:20.921 --> 00:22.637
<i>Go back.</i>

00:22.714 --> 00:24.473
<i>Her?</i>

00:24.549 --> 00:25.816
<i>Advance.</i>

00:27.469 --> 00:30.103
<i>Yes.
Him.</i>

00:30.180 --> 00:31.363
<i>Go.</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:34.357
<i>Good.</i>

00:45.245 --> 00:46.828
<i>I've seen enough.</i>

00:54.704 --> 00:56.305
You're staring.

00:56.381 --> 00:57.656
Don't stare.

00:59.334 --> 01:01.813
I've just never
seen it done before.

01:01.837 --> 01:04.137
If I may ask,

01:04.214 --> 01:06.890
what's it like?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.247
Communing with Indra?

01:10.887 --> 01:12.237
What do you hear?

01:16.268 --> 01:18.610
- I need to speak
with this Epsilon.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.914
- Speak with an Epsilon?

01:19.938 --> 01:22.572
- Not "an" Epsilon.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.291
This Epsilon.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.495
- Of course.

01:28.572 --> 01:30.580
Well, he appears to be a CJack.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.091
- Nothing gets by you.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.026
- Thank you.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.725
Told you.

01:39.749 --> 01:41.029
Here it comes.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.219
- Ow!

01:46.381 --> 01:47.984
- I think maybe you enjoy this
more than you should.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.192
I like coming down here.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.271
All the sweet little faces

01:54.347 --> 01:56.439
discovering the system together.

01:56.516 --> 01:57.658
Learning how to fit.

01:59.269 --> 02:00.819
Everyone in their place.

02:00.896 --> 02:03.280
- Everybody happy now.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.415
- You say it
like it's a bad thing.

02:06.902 --> 02:08.377
Don't take it for granted.

02:08.453 --> 02:10.495
These children will never know
violence, prejudice...

02:10.572 --> 02:12.205
Ooh, wait for it.

02:12.282 --> 02:13.748
Wait for it.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.294
Told you.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.838
<i>- Lenina Crowne.</i>
- Shit.

02:19.915 --> 02:20.915
I'm late.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.925
You made me late.

02:24.002 --> 02:26.314
- You know,
you don't have to go.

02:26.338 --> 02:27.688
- Why wouldn't I?

02:27.764 --> 02:29.525
Everyone's always talking
about how thrilling it is.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.444
Justin says you can get
right up close to them.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.351
- Yes, it's fascinating
and wild,

02:33.362 --> 02:34.978
and that's really not the point.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.813
The point is,
you want your first time

02:36.890 --> 02:39.658
to be a memory worth having.

02:39.735 --> 02:41.735
You make love at the Excelsion

02:41.811 --> 02:43.787
to anyone, everyone.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.405
You visit the exhibitions.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.867
It's all very authentic,
very real.

02:48.944 --> 02:51.504
- I don't remember you
ever going.

02:52.405 --> 02:53.788
- You can rest assured
that when I do go,

02:53.799 --> 02:55.718
it'll be with a proper Alpha,
not Bernard Marx.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.000
- He's an Alpha Plus.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.430
- Everyone says
his embryo was mishandled.

02:59.454 --> 03:01.421
He's no Plus.

03:01.498 --> 03:03.610
Probably not even an Alpha.
- Who is "everyone"?

03:03.634 --> 03:05.019
- I'm trying to give you
some friendly advice.

03:05.043 --> 03:07.311
- Mm.
Kind of you.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.970
I'll be sure to tell you
all about it

03:09.047 --> 03:10.805
when I get back.

03:45.667 --> 03:46.894
Sorry.
- Ah.

03:46.918 --> 03:49.019
- Am I late?

03:49.096 --> 03:51.304
- Yes, you... really, you are,
but it doesn't...

03:51.381 --> 03:53.732
You look...

03:53.809 --> 03:56.369
- Thank you.
So do you.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.816
- Oh, allow me to get these
for you.

04:02.892 --> 04:04.172
- Sure.

04:14.446 --> 04:16.579
Well, this should be fun.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.562
- You know, I love
the Reclamation Center

04:29.586 --> 04:31.594
at this time of day, don't you?

04:31.671 --> 04:33.930
All the colors, so...

04:34.007 --> 04:35.899
It's the cremation process.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.529
The red color, I believe,
is phosphorous.

04:40.605 --> 04:41.866
- Or it could be
aerosol particle

04:41.890 --> 04:44.107
scattering of sunlight.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.162
Which happens
when they're the same size

04:46.186 --> 04:48.664
as the wavelength
of the radiation.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.948
Smoke's denser there.
Do you see?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.469
Shorter wavelengths
can't get through.

04:53.493 --> 04:54.493
No blues, no greens.

04:54.569 --> 04:55.910
All you see is what's left.

04:55.987 --> 04:59.122
The remaining light.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.177
Longer wavelengths.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.752
And it's red.

05:03.828 --> 05:05.128
- Hmm.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.825
Is it your first time?

05:28.895 --> 05:30.445
There's nothing to it.

05:38.663 --> 05:42.040
<i>- Flight time:
11 minutes, 37 seconds.</i>

05:44.577 --> 05:45.577
- Come on, girls.

05:45.620 --> 05:46.961
- Imagine if we see a mother

05:47.038 --> 05:49.672
or a father or what's...
A grandfather?

05:49.749 --> 05:51.508
Excuse me.

05:54.796 --> 05:56.471
Beta.

05:56.548 --> 06:00.433
Did you see that?

06:00.510 --> 06:01.851
- Ah.
Here we are.

06:09.686 --> 06:10.788
Every Alpha goes

06:10.812 --> 06:12.748
to the Savage Lands at that age.

06:12.772 --> 06:13.863
- Why?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.415
- To learn what's at stake.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.882
When you ask someone to care
for the health of a society,

06:21.906 --> 06:24.466
it... well, it makes
quite an impression

06:24.534 --> 06:25.875
to show them a dead one first.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.507
- Whoa, whoa, wait,
what is this?

06:32.584 --> 06:34.092
<i>- Stand by for launch</i>

06:34.169 --> 06:38.096
<i>in four, three, two, one.</i>

06:43.178 --> 06:44.644
Bernard.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.593
- Out of range.
No network.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.814
Nothing can reach up here.
Not even Indra.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.216
You're gonna wanna feel this.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.333
Stop it.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.073
Stop it.
Stop that.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.868
Sit down.
Stop it.

07:41.945 --> 07:43.881
- These new ones do cause me
some concern.

07:43.905 --> 07:46.164
- Amazing.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.957
It's amazing.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.595
Bernard, you must try this.

07:51.671 --> 07:52.912
- Maybe on the way back.

07:52.914 --> 07:54.016
Lenina, you have
to come down now.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.276
- I'm flying!

07:55.300 --> 07:57.100
- And I see,
but we are clearing apogee

07:57.177 --> 07:58.635
as we speak and you really...

07:58.711 --> 07:59.844
Lenina, don't.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.275
- Sorry.

08:18.690 --> 08:19.864
- Lenina.

08:35.290 --> 08:36.798
- Hey.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.310
You ever lend money, goods,
or other stuff

08:38.334 --> 08:39.353
to friends or family

08:39.377 --> 08:41.010
and they take their sweet time

08:41.087 --> 08:42.207
getting it back to you?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.097
Well, those days are over,

08:44.174 --> 08:46.402
thanks to a nifty new gadget
called the Thanks Buddy.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.651
Here's how it works:

08:47.727 --> 08:49.822
just give your buddy some money,

08:49.846 --> 08:53.856
clip on the Thanks Buddy
Responsibilibracelet,

08:53.933 --> 08:55.316
and set the timer.

08:55.393 --> 08:56.526
And forget about it.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.027
When your buddy gets you back,

08:58.104 --> 08:59.821
you simply punch in the code

08:59.897 --> 09:01.739
and you're all square.

09:01.816 --> 09:03.741
Thanks, buddy.

09:03.818 --> 09:05.671
But let's say your buddy thinks
he's a little slick.

09:05.695 --> 09:08.048
Well, then the Thanks Buddy
has got you covered.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.127
- Thanks, buddy.

09:14.203 --> 09:15.723
<i>The guy who borrowed your rake?</i>

09:16.706 --> 09:18.006
<i>- Thanks, buddy.</i>

09:18.082 --> 09:19.382
<i>Gave mom 20 for groceries?</i>

09:22.003 --> 09:23.687
- I was watching that.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.308
- You were out late last night.

09:28.384 --> 09:30.685
You were with that girl.

09:30.762 --> 09:31.762
- We're not doing this.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.104
I have a lot of shit on my mind.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.281
- Mm.

09:37.769 --> 09:41.070
- She's gonna lock you
in that baby trap.

09:41.147 --> 09:44.365
You're gonna end up
working for her fat daddy

09:44.442 --> 09:47.827
in his worm farm.

09:47.904 --> 09:50.913
Then what's gonna happen to me?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.206
Where am I gonna go?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.750
- You wanna go?

09:53.826 --> 09:55.017
Let's go.
The truck's charged.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.472
We get in right now,
drive a few hours.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.755
We could be in...
- Where? The desert?

09:58.831 --> 10:00.214
Stranded, no roof?

10:00.225 --> 10:01.424
- There... there are places.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.811
- What places?
Says who?

10:02.835 --> 10:05.228
- We're gonna die here!

10:08.966 --> 10:12.185
Well, then...

10:12.261 --> 10:13.541
I might as well have a drink.

10:20.311 --> 10:22.403
- He's not coming back.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.872
He doesn't exist.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.951
- Shut your mouth.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.124
John.

10:48.005 --> 10:49.814
- Oh, that really was fun.

10:52.477 --> 10:55.019
- Everything you imagined?

10:55.096 --> 10:58.147
- How could I ever imagine this?

11:00.476 --> 11:02.235
- Shall we?
It's, um...

11:15.366 --> 11:16.499
Lenina.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.917
- Hmm?

11:22.248 --> 11:24.465
It's a deer beast.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.182
Hideous.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.532
- As if it's not hard enough

11:27.603 --> 11:29.440
scraping out some meager
existence in this place,

11:29.464 --> 11:31.033
you have to worry
about being gored and eaten

11:31.057 --> 11:32.337
by one of those things.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.818
- Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.490
Well, they're all gone now,
thankfully,

11:38.514 --> 11:41.023
so you're off the hook.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.984
The Savages saw to that.
- Oh.

11:43.060 --> 11:45.319
It's a bit...

11:45.396 --> 11:47.280
it's a bit sad, isn't it?

11:47.356 --> 11:49.376
- They had to do something,
didn't they?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.253
Said they fought them
with everything they had.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.504
Their guns, their auto cars,

11:52.528 --> 11:54.590
whatever they could get
their hands on.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.330
They're actually
quite resilient people.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.341
- Yeah, sure, but...

11:58.418 --> 12:00.343
whole species.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.920
- Bernard Marx?
Is this her?

12:02.997 --> 12:04.975
- Yes.
Lenina Crowne.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.142
- How lovely.
Welcome to the Savage Lands.

12:07.218 --> 12:09.302
I have these for you.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.854
- Thank you.

12:13.966 --> 12:14.985
- You just put it on there.

12:19.430 --> 12:20.938
- Allow me.

12:21.015 --> 12:22.618
- Now, I believe
you're not scheduled

12:22.642 --> 12:24.620
to go into the park
until tomorrow, correct?

12:24.644 --> 12:26.027
- Yes.

12:26.103 --> 12:27.456
Yeah, we thought we would take
a bit of time,

12:27.480 --> 12:28.720
check out the hotel, settle in.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.034
- Indeed, sir.
Indeed.

12:33.110 --> 12:34.377
Outstanding.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.089
There are already
a number of guests

12:36.113 --> 12:37.132
at the conjugal pool if you...

12:37.156 --> 12:38.156
- Thank you.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.001
- Your guidebook.

12:42.078 --> 12:44.139
Oh.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.546
Oh, so quaint.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.215
Yes.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.258
So there are two tours each day,

12:49.335 --> 12:51.928
morning and...
That's our afternoon tour

12:52.004 --> 12:53.471
heading out in an hour or so.

12:53.548 --> 12:55.932
There are four houses to visit
in the park:

12:56.008 --> 12:58.267
House of Want,
House of Futility,

12:58.344 --> 13:00.937
House of Consequence,
and House of Monogamy.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.297
If you're staying a few days,

13:02.373 --> 13:04.243
by all means,
see each and every one,

13:04.267 --> 13:05.909
but if you're pressed for time,

13:05.985 --> 13:08.578
I recommend visiting Want
and Consequence.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.112
- Not the others?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.156
- Each house provides
an authentic

13:12.233 --> 13:14.617
and fascinating view
into Savage life,

13:14.694 --> 13:17.870
but I do advise
our more sensitive guests

13:17.947 --> 13:19.539
to avoid Monogamy.

13:19.615 --> 13:21.176
It's quite compelling,
of course,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.510
but challenging.

13:25.329 --> 13:26.963
- Thank you.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.422
<i>- Listen to this:</i>

13:28.499 --> 13:30.934
"Among the Savage traditions
still practiced today

13:31.010 --> 13:33.063
is saving oneself
for marriage."

13:33.087 --> 13:35.304
- For or from?
- Listen.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.526
"Males and females
entering into monogamy

13:37.550 --> 13:40.028
voluntarily withhold
sexual pleasure."

13:40.052 --> 13:41.572
- From each other?
- From everyone.

13:41.596 --> 13:42.698
Anyone.
Themselves, even.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.647
- That's cruel.
Why?

13:44.724 --> 13:46.115
- Why?

13:46.192 --> 13:47.369
Doesn't say why.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.110
- Hmm.

13:49.186 --> 13:51.529
- I suppose no one knows why.

13:51.606 --> 13:55.658
That's what makes it
so primitive and mysterious.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.335
- Here we are.

13:57.412 --> 13:58.837
417.

14:06.954 --> 14:08.296
What's wrong with it?

14:08.372 --> 14:09.652
- Oh, hold on.

14:19.976 --> 14:22.018
Oh, Bernard.

14:25.723 --> 14:29.108
It's so authentic.

14:35.691 --> 14:39.619
They let you touch the skin
of an ancient one.

14:39.695 --> 14:43.331
It's transparent, the skin.

14:43.407 --> 14:44.457
Pass on that.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.014
- This isn't right.

14:57.513 --> 14:58.596
This isn't right.

15:02.218 --> 15:03.498
- What do you mean?
It's perfect.

15:24.073 --> 15:26.666
There's a view.

15:26.742 --> 15:29.001
And a smell.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.170
- We're on the wrong side.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.556
I specifically requested...

15:36.168 --> 15:37.813
Why does it never...
- What's wrong?

15:37.837 --> 15:39.114
- Nothing.
It's fine. Forget it.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.346
- Well, it doesn't seem
like there's...

15:40.357 --> 15:43.432
- It's nothing.
Go read your book.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.985
It... I just had a...

15:48.139 --> 15:50.575
I just had it a certain way
in my head

15:50.599 --> 15:52.408
and now it's just...

15:56.731 --> 16:00.116
On my Teen Alpha trip,
I just remember

16:00.192 --> 16:03.327
there was a big room
on the top floor

16:03.404 --> 16:05.371
facing the sunset.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.092
For all of us.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.293
And a whirling water tub
on the balcony.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.629
And...

16:13.706 --> 16:15.256
I don't know.
I was young and...

16:15.332 --> 16:17.350
- Bernard?

16:20.880 --> 16:25.057
- But there was... there was
something about that view.

16:25.134 --> 16:27.810
Or that night or...

16:27.887 --> 16:29.239
maybe it was being
out of New London

16:29.263 --> 16:30.479
for the first time that just...

16:33.726 --> 16:35.651
It made us forget who we were.

16:39.148 --> 16:41.541
I was happy.

16:41.617 --> 16:45.327
I was...

16:45.404 --> 16:47.830
I was different.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.249
They were different.

16:50.326 --> 16:52.126
- Different how?

16:56.808 --> 16:58.224
They were kind.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.139
- Did you know

17:05.150 --> 17:08.651
before the monogamy,

17:08.728 --> 17:12.155
the females take the bride

17:12.231 --> 17:15.691
to look at greased, naked males?

17:15.768 --> 17:20.112
She's aroused, but...

17:20.189 --> 17:23.407
she doesn't touch.

17:23.484 --> 17:25.826
She can't.

17:25.903 --> 17:27.578
- You need to stop
with that book.

17:27.589 --> 17:31.707
- And then on the wedding night,

17:31.784 --> 17:34.835
after all that arousal,

17:34.912 --> 17:37.755
all that waiting,

17:37.832 --> 17:41.217
the female...

17:41.293 --> 17:44.553
gives her virginity to the male.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.889
- She does?

17:46.966 --> 17:49.809
- She does.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.235
- What's a virginity?

17:53.639 --> 17:55.564
- I have no idea.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.596
- What's wrong?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.764
- Oh, sorry.
Where were we?

18:28.841 --> 18:31.725
- No, tell me.

18:31.802 --> 18:34.228
Please.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.398
- It's just a silly idea.

18:37.474 --> 18:39.859
- Silly?

18:39.935 --> 18:43.654
- Well, maybe not silly.
Maybe just more...

18:43.665 --> 18:45.289
naughty.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.252
Like, bad.

18:55.659 --> 18:56.939
- Go on.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.882
- What if we're not
like everyone else, Bernard?

19:02.958 --> 19:04.300
Not here in this place.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.635
What if...

19:06.712 --> 19:10.222
What if we can be different
here?

19:10.299 --> 19:12.349
I mean, I thought,
what would happen if...

19:12.426 --> 19:14.935
If we... if we...

19:14.946 --> 19:16.237
- If we saved ourselves.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.284
It could be...

19:21.360 --> 19:23.694
It could be... it could be...

19:23.705 --> 19:25.362
It could be our wedding night.

19:29.860 --> 19:30.951
- Oh,... .

19:46.001 --> 19:47.968
We're Savages.

19:59.914 --> 20:02.074
- You will respond
to the following question

20:02.368 --> 20:03.567
by stepping forward.

20:03.644 --> 20:05.622
Which of you touched
the deceased Epsilon

20:05.646 --> 20:08.989
known as CJack57?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.116
You will make yourself known.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.958
I don't understand.

20:19.034 --> 20:21.502
Epsilons are incapable
of deception.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.217
- A virus enters a cell.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.594
That's how it begins.

20:30.671 --> 20:32.480
Once inside, it corrupts,

20:32.556 --> 20:35.724
changing its nature,
altering its purpose.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.060
The virus spreads,

20:38.137 --> 20:41.814
cell by cell, undetected,

20:41.890 --> 20:44.566
turning the body against itself

20:44.643 --> 20:46.193
until...

20:46.270 --> 20:48.570
- I'm sorry, a what?

20:48.647 --> 20:50.873
- Virus.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.741
It's an old word.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.243
From before.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.745
- I see.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.207
What does it mean?

21:00.284 --> 21:02.960
- It means
that perhaps our Epsilon

21:03.037 --> 21:05.888
is no longer an Epsilon.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.136
- Stand aside.

21:12.212 --> 21:14.263
Make way
for World Controller Mond.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.078
- Tell them they may go.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.529
- All right.

21:30.606 --> 21:32.915
You Jacks get back to work.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.575
- Not you.

21:42.743 --> 21:44.543
What is our name?

21:44.620 --> 21:47.171
- CJack60.

21:47.247 --> 21:50.007
- We touched the dead worker.

21:50.084 --> 21:51.269
Did we know the worker?

21:51.293 --> 21:53.093
- Yes.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.261
I knew him.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.225
- You're a bit different,
aren't you?

22:00.302 --> 22:02.144
It's all right.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.530
You can tell me.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.942
Truth is,
I'm a bit different too.

22:12.314 --> 22:14.957
- I wasn't.

22:15.034 --> 22:18.077
But then...

22:18.153 --> 22:19.153
now I am.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.963
- You changed?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.132
When you touched him?

22:23.209 --> 22:26.168
What happened to you?

22:26.245 --> 22:28.670
What did you feel?
- I didn't.

22:28.747 --> 22:29.880
I don't.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.715
- Oh, I think you do.

22:31.792 --> 22:32.966
- Feel.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.984
I felt him.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.852
- The worker.
- My friend.

22:50.269 --> 22:53.862
- Did anyone else
touch the body?

22:53.939 --> 22:54.905
I need to know.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.871
- The Soma man.

23:07.911 --> 23:10.879
- Hey!

23:10.956 --> 23:12.901
Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.384
Apologies.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.019
Sorry.

23:17.096 --> 23:21.932
- Greetings, and welcome
to the Savage Lands Adventure.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.726
I'm Gamma Gracie,
and I'll be your guide today.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.082
Before we get to the park,
I have a couple bits of info

23:27.106 --> 23:31.200
to keep your visit fun, safe,
and Savage.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.281
According to Savage lore,
their culture dates back

23:37.357 --> 23:40.701
almost 200 years.

23:40.777 --> 23:42.964
When the inception of Indra
allowed the civilized people

23:42.988 --> 23:45.038
of the world
to form the World State,

23:45.049 --> 23:47.216
the Savages chose to reject
that destiny,

23:47.293 --> 23:49.751
which is why they continue
in their primitive existence

23:49.828 --> 23:51.053
to this day.

24:32.996 --> 24:34.963
- You didn't forget, did you?

24:35.040 --> 24:38.091
- Madysun.
Hey.

24:38.168 --> 24:40.010
Oh, shit, right.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.813
Gimme a second.

25:12.369 --> 25:16.138
- It's gonna be a good crowd
today.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.257
- That's great.

25:18.333 --> 25:21.301
That's great.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.011
I need to talk to you.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.513
- Okay, places in 20.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.859
- Find me after the show.

25:33.557 --> 25:36.117
- Hey.
Why aren't you ready?

25:48.447 --> 25:50.339
She... loves me, man.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.419
Look, dude,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

25:55.495 --> 25:58.005
You know, beaning you
in the head and stuff.

25:58.081 --> 25:59.934
- Yeah. That's okay.
- No, it's not.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.883
I mean, God damn it,
I'm an artist, John.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.052
You know this.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.554
When things don't go right
out there,

26:05.631 --> 26:08.265
I just can get a little...
You know?

26:08.342 --> 26:10.058
- Right.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.318
- Hey.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.364
Look, man,

26:15.441 --> 26:19.943
there's nothing more dangerous
than live theater.

26:20.020 --> 26:22.112
Okay?
There's no net, you know?

26:22.189 --> 26:24.498
And I walk that wire
because in the end,

26:24.575 --> 26:27.326
I want the same thing you want.

26:27.402 --> 26:29.878
I just wanna show these people
something true.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.214
Right?

26:32.291 --> 26:33.957
- Uh-huh.

26:34.034 --> 26:35.584
- Anyway, you were just trying
to do your job

26:35.595 --> 26:37.586
and I was outta line, so...

26:37.663 --> 26:39.087
I mean,... it, man, come on.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.891
Let's... let's have a good show.
Come on.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.134
That feels good.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.094
Yeah.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.305
Oh, and one more thing.

26:48.382 --> 26:50.232
You go near my girl again,

26:50.309 --> 26:51.900
I'll... kill you.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.241
# La-la-la-la, la-la #

26:59.318 --> 27:01.318
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la #

27:01.395 --> 27:02.953
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la #

27:28.171 --> 27:29.565
- If I may direct your attention

27:29.589 --> 27:30.639
to the left side,

27:30.716 --> 27:32.474
I think I see...

27:32.551 --> 27:33.551
Yes.

27:33.593 --> 27:36.353
It's a complete unit.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.897
Now, we don't always see
the females out like this

27:38.908 --> 27:40.107
in the daytime.

27:40.183 --> 27:42.984
Notice the distended abdomen?

27:43.061 --> 27:45.206
The infant will remain inside
her for a few more months

27:45.230 --> 27:47.350
until it can fight its way
out of her body.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.034
- Beta.

27:51.111 --> 27:53.578
Get up.
I can't see.

27:53.655 --> 27:55.038
You heard me.

27:55.115 --> 27:57.165
I asked your Beta to move.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.095
- Yeah, I think the view's
actually better up front.

27:59.119 --> 28:01.044
- No.
I'm an Alpha.

28:01.121 --> 28:03.964
She's a Beta.
She moves.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.182
- No, wait.
Just...

28:07.210 --> 28:09.177
- Hey!

28:09.254 --> 28:10.356
- I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

28:10.380 --> 28:11.313
- Give it back!
- Give what back?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.098
- My level!
Give it back!

28:13.175 --> 28:14.316
Give it back!

28:16.428 --> 28:18.019
Don't look at me!

28:18.096 --> 28:19.688
- Bernard.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.573
Give it back.

28:23.643 --> 28:25.610
- Hey.

28:25.687 --> 28:27.037
Earn this.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.705
<i>both: # By and by #</i>

28:36.782 --> 28:39.166
<i># When the morning comes #</i>

28:39.242 --> 28:41.293
<i># All the saints of God
are gathered home #</i>

28:41.303 --> 28:43.295
- Here you go.

28:43.371 --> 28:44.671
<i>Both: # We'll tell the story #</i>

28:44.748 --> 28:46.047
- For you.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.049
<i>Both: # How we've overcome #</i>

28:48.126 --> 28:51.970
<i># We'll understand it better
by and by #</i>

28:52.047 --> 28:54.431
<i>- # Trials dark on every hand #</i>

28:54.508 --> 28:56.558
<i># We cannot understand #</i>

28:56.635 --> 28:58.613
<i># The ways
that God would lead us #</i>

28:58.637 --> 29:00.415
<i># To that blessed
promised land #</i>

29:00.439 --> 29:02.230
- And welcome

29:02.241 --> 29:05.200
to the Savage Lands
Adventure Park.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.197
<i>- # We'll understand it
better by and by #</i>

29:10.273 --> 29:13.375
<i>both: # We'll understand it
better by and by #</i>

29:13.452 --> 29:15.597
- Even certain days of the year
continue to hold

29:15.621 --> 29:18.172
great superstitious meaning
for the Savages,

29:18.248 --> 29:21.124
but from Savage lore, we know
that none were more important

29:21.201 --> 29:23.343
than the annual Day of Black.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.588
- Who are they?

29:26.665 --> 29:29.716
- They... they're part of it.

29:29.793 --> 29:31.760
- Ah!
And what luck.

29:31.837 --> 29:32.961
These Savages have come

29:33.038 --> 29:36.523
to share their festival with us.

29:46.393 --> 29:49.236
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.</i>

29:49.312 --> 29:51.530
<i>Our show is about to commence.</i>

30:24.222 --> 30:26.731
<i>- Next up,
the House of Monogamy.</i>

30:26.808 --> 30:28.375
<i>Now, the reasons behind</i>

30:28.451 --> 30:31.361
<i>the Savages' most primitive
practice remain a mystery,</i>

30:31.438 --> 30:34.155
<i>but we do know that monogamy
is an important tradition</i>

30:34.232 --> 30:36.377
<i>which allows the Savages
to combine the core values</i>

30:36.401 --> 30:37.325
<i>of their culture:</i>

30:37.336 --> 30:39.619
ownership, competition,

30:39.630 --> 30:41.746
jealousy, and strife.

30:41.823 --> 30:43.248
And here we are.

30:43.325 --> 30:46.376
We do hope you enjoy
the presentation.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.254
For those of you continuing on
to the House of Consequence,

30:49.331 --> 30:51.464
we'd like to remind you
to please keep your hands...

30:51.475 --> 30:53.603
- What's the House
of Consequence?

30:53.627 --> 30:55.227
- It's called a prison.

30:55.304 --> 30:56.678
They...

30:56.755 --> 30:58.689
Yeah, they cut off
part of their Social Body

30:58.765 --> 30:59.848
and keep it there.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.474
- Oh, fun fact:

31:01.485 --> 31:04.102
outside of captivity,
Savages are able to double

31:04.179 --> 31:05.604
or even triple their body mass

31:05.614 --> 31:07.823
through the consumption of food.

31:12.270 --> 31:16.114
<i>- # Here and now #</i>

31:16.191 --> 31:20.377
<i># I promise to love faithfully #</i>

31:20.454 --> 31:22.829
<i>- # Faithfully #</i>

31:22.906 --> 31:27.751
<i>- # You're all I need #</i>

31:27.827 --> 31:31.880
<i># Here and now #</i>

31:31.957 --> 31:34.516
<i># I vow to be one #</i>

31:34.593 --> 31:37.218
<i># With thee #</i>

31:37.295 --> 31:39.596
- Bernard?

31:39.673 --> 31:40.889
Counselor Bernard Marx?

31:40.966 --> 31:42.774
- Yes.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.529
I thought you weren't coming
till tomorrow.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.825
- Sorry, forgive me.
Who are you?

31:49.849 --> 31:51.274
- Cortez.

31:51.351 --> 31:52.400
I administer the park.

31:52.477 --> 31:53.871
Surely the Director told you
about me.

31:53.895 --> 31:57.155
- Oh.
No.

31:57.232 --> 31:58.531
But he can be forgetful.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.908
- Can he?

31:59.919 --> 32:02.535
Well, I suppose he can, yes.

32:02.612 --> 32:04.746
He sent me to administer
the park for one year.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.548
Seven years ago.

32:10.245 --> 32:12.420
Well, I hope you enjoy
your stay.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.650
- Oh, thank you very much.

32:13.674 --> 32:15.757
No, everything is just
as I remember it.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.550
- Oh, good.
- When I came to the...

32:58.334 --> 33:00.844
Well, I am going to miss it.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.605
- Oh, you're leaving?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.849
- He didn't tell you?

33:05.925 --> 33:07.611
Tell me what?

33:07.635 --> 33:08.643
- Oh, it's time.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.978
Do come and find me
after the show.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.688
I'd love to give you a tour
personally.

33:11.765 --> 33:14.366
- Wh... sorry, excuse me...

33:16.561 --> 33:17.736
<i>- # No other love #</i>

33:17.812 --> 33:20.914
- Lenina.

33:20.991 --> 33:22.874
- Is this part of it?

33:22.951 --> 33:24.710
- Lenina, please.
Just...

33:27.447 --> 33:30.832
<i>- # Now that I've known #</i>

33:30.909 --> 33:37.255
<i># The comfort of your arms #</i>

33:37.332 --> 33:41.393
<i># No other love #</i>

33:41.470 --> 33:44.512
<i># Oh, the sweet contentment #</i>

33:44.589 --> 33:47.515
<i># That I find #</i>

33:47.592 --> 33:49.809
<i># With you #</i>

33:49.820 --> 33:52.479
<i># Every time #</i>

33:52.555 --> 33:53.555
<i># Every time #</i>

33:58.511 --> 34:00.662
<i>- # Around for something new #</i>

34:03.033 --> 34:03.948
<i># Me and you #</i>

34:03.959 --> 34:06.076
- But what does he do?

34:06.152 --> 34:08.578
- He oversees the transfer
of ownership

34:08.655 --> 34:10.049
to assure
that both sides are satisfied

34:10.073 --> 34:12.499
with the exchange.

34:12.575 --> 34:14.042
- Why does he wear that hat?

34:14.119 --> 34:15.835
- For safety.

34:15.912 --> 34:18.032
<i>Both: # How much it is
to love someone #</i>

34:18.081 --> 34:22.759
<i># You know so well #</i>

34:22.836 --> 34:23.896
<i># What in the world #</i>

34:23.920 --> 34:25.386
- It's exactly as I remember it.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.597
They haven't changed a thing.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.610
- Why are the bridesmaids
so angry?

34:29.634 --> 34:31.112
- Because they're next.
- Come on. Come on!

34:31.136 --> 34:32.435
- There's the father.

34:32.446 --> 34:33.786
- It's the second one
I've seen today.

34:33.788 --> 34:35.221
- I know.
They're everywhere here.

34:35.298 --> 34:36.689
- I knew that... I mean,
it's one thing to know it,

34:36.700 --> 34:37.827
but to see it
with your own eyes...

34:37.851 --> 34:40.860
- Look, see, he gives her away
to the...

34:40.937 --> 34:43.113
To the groom man.

34:43.189 --> 34:45.031
- Why?

34:45.108 --> 34:46.616
Doesn't he want her anymore?

34:46.693 --> 34:49.035
<i>- # A love that's lost its way #</i>

34:49.112 --> 34:51.996
- Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

34:52.073 --> 34:55.041
to join Petr and Madysun

34:55.118 --> 34:57.085
in monogamy.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.429
If there's any man here
who has some reason

34:59.506 --> 35:01.433
why they shouldn't be joined
together,

35:01.457 --> 35:03.466
forever and ever,

35:03.543 --> 35:06.427
without having anybody else,
ever,

35:06.504 --> 35:08.607
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

35:08.631 --> 35:10.640
I do.

35:10.717 --> 35:11.724
I have something to say.

35:11.735 --> 35:12.976
- Not you.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.812
Kvle the town outlaw?

35:15.889 --> 35:17.739
- Don't be monogamous with him,
Madysun.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.691
Be monogamous with me.

35:19.767 --> 35:22.163
- This is jealousy.
It will lead to violence.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.820
- Let him speak.

35:23.897 --> 35:25.822
I am the mother of the groom

35:25.899 --> 35:28.992
and we must know if she has
no virginity to give!

35:30.003 --> 35:31.728
- Oh, Madysun.

35:31.805 --> 35:35.540
How many nights did I call out
your name in the darkness?

35:35.551 --> 35:38.668
All those nights I spent
in the cold,

35:38.745 --> 35:41.880
cursing the day I left
to seek my fortune,

35:41.956 --> 35:44.090
hungry by the roadside,

35:44.167 --> 35:45.967
alone,

35:46.044 --> 35:50.138
staring at the moon wondering,
"Is this her moon too?

35:50.215 --> 35:52.482
Is there still some light
we share?"

35:54.552 --> 35:56.019
And I dreamed of you, my love.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.939
And that dream saved me.

36:00.016 --> 36:01.774
It kept me alive.

36:01.785 --> 36:05.570
And I wanted to give it a word,
a name.

36:05.647 --> 36:08.698
What word do you call
your salvation?

36:08.775 --> 36:11.701
Love?

36:11.778 --> 36:14.037
That's not enough.

36:14.047 --> 36:17.207
Because some women
carry the grace

36:17.283 --> 36:19.876
that requires metaphor.

36:19.953 --> 36:22.962
So I called it Moon.

36:23.039 --> 36:24.714
And that's the name

36:24.791 --> 36:26.883
I'm gonna call that baby
in your belly

36:26.960 --> 36:28.560
because I'm the one
who put it there.

36:28.637 --> 36:30.105
It's mine!

36:30.129 --> 36:31.605
It's my baby!

36:31.681 --> 36:33.973
- Like hell you will.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.516
I'll kill you first.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.565
- Jealousy!

36:42.576 --> 36:43.953
Is this part of it?

36:43.977 --> 36:46.828
Of course.

36:48.273 --> 36:49.291
- you!

36:56.289 --> 36:58.092
- I don't remember this.
- They're not blanks!

36:58.116 --> 36:59.843
They're not blanks!
They're live rounds!

36:59.867 --> 37:01.553
- What, that's not his line.
- They're live rounds!

37:01.577 --> 37:03.253
- It's not his line!

37:05.840 --> 37:07.215
- Bernard, is this part of it?

37:07.292 --> 37:09.008
Bernard?
What?

37:09.085 --> 37:10.644
Bernard?
Come on.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.062
Come on!
Run!

37:12.138 --> 37:14.013
Run!

37:22.140 --> 37:23.615
- Bernard.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.943
Bernard.
Come on.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.158
Come on.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.802
Bernard.
Bernard, open up.

37:41.826 --> 37:43.126
Swallow.

37:43.202 --> 37:44.636
- There's...

37:44.713 --> 37:46.012
They're shooting guns at us.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.683
- What? Why would...
- There's something in me.

37:47.707 --> 37:48.885
- What?
- There's something...

37:48.909 --> 37:50.236
What... what do you...

37:50.260 --> 37:51.801
No!

37:57.800 --> 37:59.028
Why are you doing this, Bernard?

37:59.052 --> 38:01.853
Bernard, stop doing this.

38:01.929 --> 38:04.647
- Two of them!
Spread out!

38:04.658 --> 38:06.607
- Come on.
Come on, Bernard.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.945
- Don't pity them.

38:53.022 --> 38:54.331
They don't deserve it.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.252
- They're dead.

39:01.956 --> 39:05.375
- You look at me.

39:05.451 --> 39:09.087
The outsiders,
they took our land.

39:09.163 --> 39:12.131
They didn't take our dignity.

39:12.208 --> 39:16.386
It was traitors like these
who gave it away.

39:16.462 --> 39:19.889
We didn't kill these people.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.775
These people were never alive.

39:26.722 --> 39:29.899
Are you alive, John?

39:39.077 --> 39:40.337
- 22 on the bus.

39:40.361 --> 39:42.056
Seven dead.
Two missing.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.415
I have people searching now.

39:45.491 --> 39:47.875
- They're not made for running.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.711
Take whatever folks you need.

39:50.788 --> 39:53.840
Go house to house

39:53.916 --> 39:55.341
until you find them.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.978
They're going to listen now.

40:07.054 --> 40:09.480
We will not be ignored.

40:09.557 --> 40:11.149
But first,

40:11.225 --> 40:14.318
collaborators must be held
to account.

40:14.395 --> 40:15.486
You get up!

40:26.240 --> 40:29.167
There is work to be done.

40:29.243 --> 40:31.252
You don't wash cars anymore.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.531
Bernard.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.986
No!

40:53.893 --> 40:55.045
- Bernard.

41:01.084 --> 41:04.869
Bernard.

41:04.946 --> 41:06.913
Bernard.

41:06.989 --> 41:09.340
Bernard.
Please.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.882
- Shh.

42:41.959 --> 42:45.052
Shh.

42:52.178 --> 42:54.979
<i>- # See the pretty girl #</i>

42:55.056 --> 42:58.232
<i># See the pretty boy #</i>
