WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:06.274
Okay, how do we look?

00:06.307 --> 00:07.275
Ooh, cute.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.276
I'm an evil scientist

00:08.309 --> 00:10.178
and Debbie's my lab rat.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.113
He's disregarding my rights
as one of God's creatures

00:12.146 --> 00:13.747
by growing human parts
on my back.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.618
Grandpa, let's make
the scariest pumpkin

00:17.651 --> 00:18.586
in the whole neighborhood.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.121
Ooh, that's a tall order.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.622
What we'll need
is some inspiration.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.225
Think of the meanest,
most terrifying,

00:24.258 --> 00:27.628
hateful monster that
you could possibly imagine.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.597
Happy Halloween!

00:29.630 --> 00:32.600
Hello, pumpkin.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.703
Hey, uh, hope you don't mind.
I just need to borrow a costume.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.472
Every drugstore between our
house and here is sold out.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.640
I warned him all week

00:39.673 --> 00:41.742
not to wait till
the last minute.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.477
He's always last-minute
shopping for the holidays.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.846
Which is why last Christmas
I got breath mints,

00:45.879 --> 00:49.617
the wrong razor blades,
and The Bodyguard on DVD.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.620
Nathan, just admit
you were wrong

00:52.653 --> 00:54.322
and should've
shopped earlier.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.590
No! I... You know what?
I tell you who's wrong.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.527
Is my my boss who makes
reporters wear costumes on air.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.262
If your station's
been doing costumes for years,

01:01.295 --> 01:02.630
then you should've known--

01:02.663 --> 01:04.798
Okay, I was wrong!
Can we let it go?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.567
Take it from someone
who was married to her.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.670
She won't let it go.
She likes to torture people.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.672
She thought Zero Dark Thirty
was a comedy.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.709
Yeah, Mom, it is annoying the
way you always gloat about it

01:15.743 --> 01:17.778
when one of us messes up--
like when I failed

01:17.811 --> 01:19.247
my driver's test

01:19.280 --> 01:20.248
or when I burnt
the Thanksgiving turkey

01:20.281 --> 01:21.282
or when I married Adam.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.718
A different Adam.
Not your dad.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.888
It is my duty as your mother
to point out your shortcomings.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.158
My criticisms help you
build character.

01:30.191 --> 01:34.528
The fact that I enjoy it
simply makes it a win-win.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.664
If it builds character
to admit that you're wrong,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.432
how come you never do it?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.901
Oh, trust me, I would love
to build some character.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.804
I just never get a chance
'cause I'm never wrong.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.440
(all laugh)

01:46.474 --> 01:47.775
Why is that funny?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.377
Name a time I was wrong.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.779
Nathan, think of a time.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.614
What?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.149
Yes, okay... just...

01:55.183 --> 01:56.850
Dad, think of a time.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.353
Oh, well, she, uh...

01:59.387 --> 02:02.356
Pass.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.691
Oh, oh! Got it!

02:03.724 --> 02:06.194
You misspelled my middle name
on my birth certificate.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.795
So, now instead
of Nathan James,

02:07.828 --> 02:09.530
I'm Nathan Jasem.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.300
J-A-S-E-M.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.834
Jasem.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.303
Actually, that was me.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.438
I was drunk.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.839
Waiting rooms were
different back then.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.776
Whoo! Check out this old school
French maid costume!

02:22.810 --> 02:24.545
Carol, I'm proud of you, girl!

02:24.578 --> 02:27.281
Actually, that was me.
I was drunk.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.250
Halloweens were different
back then.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.951
Go down
to the basement

02:30.984 --> 02:33.421
and get a few
of my craft boxes.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.224
I can make a costume
out of anything.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.426
When the Leesburg Little Theater
did their version

02:38.459 --> 02:40.928
of A Few Good Men,
I made 14 military costumes

02:40.961 --> 02:43.664
out of tablecloths
and bottle caps.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.733
I even filled in once
for the lead.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.402
Ooh, I bet you made a hot
Demi Moore, didn't you?

02:48.436 --> 02:51.772
No, but I was a very inspiring
Jack Nicholson.

02:51.805 --> 02:52.973
Oh!
People saluted me

02:53.006 --> 02:55.876
at the grocery store for weeks.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.345
(chuckles)

02:57.378 --> 02:59.313
Look who's here.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.748
Artie!

03:00.781 --> 03:02.816
I spotted this ogre and figured,

03:02.850 --> 03:05.719
there must be a beautiful
princess here in need of rescue.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.888
Adam, you're the ogre.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.790
Yeah, we got it.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.593
You having chili?
I like chili on Halloween.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.595
Well, we have mac and cheese.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.330
Oh, that would
be great

03:16.364 --> 03:18.866
if I wasn't in
the mood for chili.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.703
What's the deal
with Sir Lance-a-little?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
He's our annoying
neighbor Artie.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.375
His parents keep
dumping him off here.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.876
He's, like, this new breed
of species: "cocky nerd."

03:28.909 --> 03:30.744
They're popping up
everywhere

03:30.778 --> 03:32.946
now that schools have gotten
rid of all the bullies.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.515
ADAM: Mikayla
thinks he's funny

03:34.548 --> 03:35.949
and she has
a crush on him,

03:35.983 --> 03:37.785
so we got to be
super nice to him.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.986
You know, we're afraid
that if she knows

03:39.019 --> 03:40.754
that Debbie and I
don't like him,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.356
that she's just gonna
like him even more.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.791
So just get rid of him.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.393
When Mikayla's not looking,

03:45.426 --> 03:48.529
take the best candy from her
bag and plant it on him.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.931
Even Taylor Swift wouldn't date
a candy thief,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.400
and she'll date anyone.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.570
What? I read magazines.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.572
Okay, Mom, I would never
frame a little kid.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.040
Yeah, plus,
if we get caught,

04:00.073 --> 04:01.509
it's just gonna push
them closer

04:01.542 --> 04:02.710
to their wedding
at Medieval Times,

04:02.743 --> 04:04.011
and I am not
gonna let him ruin

04:04.044 --> 04:06.780
Medieval Times for me!

04:06.814 --> 04:08.282
All right, Mom,

04:08.316 --> 04:10.284
found some glue, streamers,

04:10.318 --> 04:12.686
and a bunch
of old party hats.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.855
You think you can do
something with this?

04:17.525 --> 04:19.893
The world's
most handsome piñata.

04:19.927 --> 04:23.564
The only way
this would be more perfect

04:23.597 --> 04:25.633
is if you were hanging
from the ceiling.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.901
I agree.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.060
Our sources indicate

04:53.093 --> 04:54.562
they plan on charging him
as an adult.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.365
The Leesburg Police Department
has also asked

04:57.398 --> 04:59.433
that you no longer give kids
the option of "trick."

04:59.467 --> 05:00.834
I'm Nathan Miller

05:00.868 --> 05:04.772
walking your safer
but still spooky streets.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.608
Nice work.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.810
Uh-oh, you got
a bogey at 4:00.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.513
Whoa! No-no-no.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.715
No, not a real piñata.
Run along.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.619
(hollow thud, clattering)
ARTIE: Come back!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.354
You gotta be kidding me.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.957
Be nice.
Hey...

05:23.991 --> 05:27.495
hey, buddy,
what seems to be the problem?

05:27.528 --> 05:30.130
I'm tired, and all this trick-
or-treating has given me

05:30.163 --> 05:32.933
a great thirst.
I need my goblet of grape juice.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.469
Well, that's all the way
back at the house.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.806
To retrieve it,
send your tallest man.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.842
(boy in baseball
uniform laughing)

05:41.875 --> 05:43.977
Listen, would you stop laughing?
I'm not real!

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
There is so much free candy
around here.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.448
Why are you doing this?

05:47.481 --> 05:50.050
WOMAN: Tyler, stop playing
with that strange man!

05:51.752 --> 05:55.055
Uncle Nate, will you take me
to the house on the corner?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.958
She keeps insisting on going
up to the house on the corner.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.794
I keep saying no because it's
the house on the corner, Nathan.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.430
The house...

06:02.463 --> 06:05.065
(spooky voice):
on the corner...

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
Oh, my God, do you still think
that a witch lives there?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.803
No, I think a creepy
woman lives there.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.872
However, I was told
she was a witch

06:11.905 --> 06:13.073
by a person who has
recently discovered

06:13.106 --> 06:14.575
has never been wrong.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.477
Mom did say that.
She used to always say,

06:16.510 --> 06:18.145
"Don't go near the house
on the corner

06:18.178 --> 06:19.613
'cause a witch
lived there."

06:19.647 --> 06:20.814
There is something
she was wrong about!

06:20.848 --> 06:22.883
So, can we go?
Oh, we're going.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.151
Ray, get your camera.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.553
We need proof
that Mom was wrong.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.592
Trick-or-treat!

06:31.625 --> 06:33.894
Oh, look at you, so cute.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.530
Oh, a compliment.
How non-witchy of her, right?

06:36.564 --> 06:37.531
Start filming.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.900
Let me get some candy.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.535
Come on in.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.636
Not you, Blackie.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.606
Blackie's an outside cat.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.140
Oh, my goodness.
(chuckles)

06:47.174 --> 06:49.777
I thought we were gonna have
a big problem just now.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.512
(laughs)

06:51.545 --> 06:54.948
Normally, I don't get
any trick-or-treaters.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.485
That's because everybody
thinks you're a witch.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.854
Mikayla! Sorry.
She's just a child.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.923
(chuckles)
My only child!

07:02.956 --> 07:05.993
A child who'd been fed
two generations of
misinformation,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.595
because anybody who thinks

07:07.628 --> 07:08.929
that-that you're a witch

07:08.962 --> 07:10.864
is clearly wrong.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.534
Oh, no, that's right.
I'm a witch.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.002
Well, technically, a wiccan.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.204
Great. Mom was right.
She's a witch.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.707
Okay, cut,
and burn the tape.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.175
I know I have some candy
here somewhere.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.479
Let me go check the kitchen.

07:25.513 --> 07:29.216
Oh, my God! I was so close
to proving Mom wrong!

07:29.249 --> 07:31.752
I even had the skywriting
worked out in my head.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.255
It was just
gonna say, "Ha!"

07:35.288 --> 07:37.691
You gotta pay
by the letter.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.894
I'm gonna go load the truck up.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.462
Take it easy, Blackie.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.733
Awesome parrot!

07:45.766 --> 07:47.234
DEBBIE:
Huh, look at that.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.671
Kind of looks
like my old bird Cappy.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.740
You never told me
you had a bird.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.576
Yeah, when I was running for
seventh-grade class president,

07:55.609 --> 07:57.745
I trained him to say,
"Vote for Debbie."

07:57.778 --> 07:59.747
And then, right before
the election,

07:59.780 --> 08:03.884
someone left the window
open and he flew away.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.653
It was an accident, okay?!

08:05.686 --> 08:07.655
I felt so bad that you lost
the election,

08:07.688 --> 08:09.857
I didn't even vote for myself
for prom king.

08:09.890 --> 08:14.161
And yes, I won anyway, but you
can't control the masses.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.696
(squawks)
Vote for Debbie.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.665
Did he just say...?
(squawks)
Vote for Debbie.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.166
(squawks)
Vote for Debbie.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.634
Nathan, I think that's Cappy.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.603
Here you go.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.971
DEBBIE:
Excuse me, uh,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.706
Mrs. Witch. (chuckles)

08:25.739 --> 08:27.174
Uh, where did you get
this bird?

08:27.207 --> 08:30.544
Oh, we was given to me
a long time ago.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.712
By who?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.681
Oh, a lady
in the neighborhood.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.882
Oh, it's been so many years.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.249
Let's see.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.786
Kind of bossy,
a voice like a foghorn,

08:38.819 --> 08:40.688
and for some reason,
people used

08:40.721 --> 08:43.023
to salute her
in the grocery store.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.726
Mom... Mom did
something wrong.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.927
Thank you very much.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.696
I can't believe it.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.698
I can't believe that
she let me spend 20 years

08:50.731 --> 08:51.832
believing that I was
responsible.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.066
She didn't just do
something wrong,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.735
she did something
morally wrong,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.737
and that is the wrongest wrong!
And we caught her!

08:56.770 --> 08:58.739
Oh, God, I would...!

08:58.772 --> 09:00.741
kiss you right now

09:00.774 --> 09:02.643
if there wasn't
a small part of me

09:02.676 --> 09:05.112
that thought I might turn
into a frog!

09:05.145 --> 09:07.247
But it is a miracle.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.782
It's a Halloween miracle!

09:17.758 --> 09:20.260
I can't believe your mom
gave Cappy away.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.163
Had I known at the time, well...

09:23.196 --> 09:25.265
I probably wouldn't have
done anything.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.934
You know what?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.836
Maybe we shouldn't tell her
that we know right away.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.704
We should have fun with this.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.741
Toy with her like a,
like a kitten with a cricket.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.776
Yeah, 'cause I want this
feeling to last.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.211
I want my first time
to be special.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.815
Ah, you guys are back early.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.217
Yes... we are.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.054
You know, life can be
a funny thing.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.188
Ah...

09:48.221 --> 09:50.123
One minute you're kind of...

09:50.157 --> 09:51.825
You stole my bird
and gave it to a witch!

09:51.859 --> 09:53.593
Well, you just ate the cricket!

09:55.162 --> 09:57.030
What are you talking about?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.832
The jig is up, Carol.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.701
The kids talked to the witch.
You gave her Cappy

10:00.734 --> 10:01.735
and blamed it on Nathan.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.037
Oh, please, that was
20 years ago.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.006
So was "Achy Breaky Heart"!

10:06.039 --> 10:10.010
It doesn't make either
of those things less wrong!

10:12.412 --> 10:14.915
I wasn't wrong!
The bird was a menace.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.884
Debbie hated taking care of it,

10:16.917 --> 10:19.386
it squawked at Tom,
it bit you once,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.388
it had all of us arguing.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.890
You should be thanking me.

10:22.923 --> 10:23.924
Wrong again.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.726
No one is thanking you.
No one.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.327
'Cause for 20 years,
I've carried the guilt

10:27.360 --> 10:28.796
of letting Cappy escape.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.330
Yeah, and I have
harbored feelings

10:30.363 --> 10:32.165
of hate for my
very own brother.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.235
Feelings that ultimately
led to me keying his car.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.403
Yeah.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.006
Wait, you keyed
my Camaro?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.407
They couldn't
buff it out.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.242
I had to add words.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.712
"Nathan sucks...

10:44.745 --> 10:46.279
at not being awesome."

10:48.782 --> 10:51.218
It's a double negative
that means I'm awesome.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.920
Look what you've
done to us.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.755
Well, not every plan
is perfect.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.256
Sometimes there has to be
collateral damage

10:56.289 --> 10:57.424
for the good of the family.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.959
Collateral damage!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.928
For once, just admit
you were wrong.
Yeah, Mom.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.696
And without Cappy,
I lost the election.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.798
Okay? Who knows what
I could've accomplished

11:04.832 --> 11:06.299
if I'd been elected
class president.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.968
I mean, I might've
gone to a college

11:08.001 --> 11:10.003
that didn't start
with "www."

11:12.505 --> 11:13.841
Okay, fine.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.876
I may have made a mistake
on this one.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.978
Although I think
my greatest sin

11:18.011 --> 11:19.446
is loving my family
too much.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.049
But if you really need
to hear me say it...

11:24.918 --> 11:25.919
...let me know.

11:29.089 --> 11:29.890
Mother...

11:31.892 --> 11:33.794
I shouldn't have
given your bird away.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.163
I was wrong.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.464
(cork pops)

11:37.497 --> 11:39.432
I knew I was saving this
for something.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.339
Oh, I gotta say...

11:46.373 --> 11:48.141
I never thought
this day would come.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.110
(laughing)

11:50.143 --> 11:51.511
You know...

11:51.544 --> 11:54.381
there are so many people
that I want to thank, uh...

11:54.414 --> 11:56.283
Debbie...

11:56.316 --> 11:57.951
Dad...

11:57.985 --> 11:59.452
This isn't just a win for us,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.989
this is also a devastating
loss for Mom.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.758
(bird squawks)

12:09.897 --> 12:11.531
Look who's back.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.166
Cappy?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.534
I don't like being wrong,

12:14.567 --> 12:15.969
so I made things right.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.238
You can't just barge
into my home and...

12:18.271 --> 12:19.372
We had a deal.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.041
You could keep the bird

12:21.074 --> 12:23.010
as long as my kids didn't
find out he was here.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.878
Well, they found out.
Now I need him back.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.148
Wiccan spirits,
hear me shout!

12:28.181 --> 12:31.351
Make this woman's
teeth fall out!

12:31.384 --> 12:32.920
Cut the crap, Myra.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.888
Our kids went to
the same preschool.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.556
If you really
had magical powers,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.158
your little Jeremy wouldn't
have been kicked out

12:38.191 --> 12:40.527
for drinking out of the toilet.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.095
So he's ours again?

12:42.129 --> 12:43.363
We're keeping Cappy?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.898
(gasps)
We are?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.366
Yep-o!

12:46.399 --> 12:48.802
Cappy's back home
where he belongs.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.270
I'm gonna go get Cappy

12:50.303 --> 12:52.072
some crackers.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.475
Here are his vitamins
and a list of care instructions.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.444
His favorite recipes
are on the back.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.880
Apparently,
he's a little fickle.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.949
Well, I'll let
you guys catch up.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.952
Although you probably have
30 years to do that,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.887
since parrots live
to be at least 60.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.588
Good night!

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
Have fun.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.461
(door closes)

13:14.494 --> 13:16.496
Oh, she is good.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.598
Did you see what
she just did?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.067
She gave us the bird.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.502
Oh, she gave us
the bird, all right.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.537
The cricket just
ate the kitten.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.608
She thinks that we're gonna bail

13:28.641 --> 13:29.910
on taking care of him,

13:29.943 --> 13:31.544
and prove that
she's right.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.046
But we're not.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.848
'Cause we are gonna
take care of Cappy,

13:34.882 --> 13:36.516
no matter what.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.085
Call me if you need anything.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.519
But we're... Nathan!
No, no, no, no.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.388
I can't take care
of a bird.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.990
They're a lot of work
and they're really expensive.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.925
(squawks)

13:44.958 --> 13:46.493
Listen, that bird
may squawk a lot,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.528
but he's never gonna squawk
as much as your mother will

13:48.561 --> 13:50.497
if we admit she was right.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.598
Debbie, you can do this.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.632
And don't worry.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.101
I'll pay for
whatever he needs.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.102
Okay, fine.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.103
NATHAN:
Yeah.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.170
We can't let Mom win.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.405
That's the spirit!

13:58.438 --> 14:00.207
Together we can take
care of this beast.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.975
I'll also help you
with the bird.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.011
(squawks)

14:09.182 --> 14:10.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.885
Tom, Tom, you can't
put the blanket on.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.053
We're-we're trying
to keep him awake

14:13.086 --> 14:14.121
so he doesn't
squawk all night.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.588
Was that him squawking?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.457
I thought it was your
bedsprings-- I was impressed.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.959
Till I realized

14:18.992 --> 14:20.593
it was my daughter.
Then I got angry.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.295
Then...

14:22.329 --> 14:24.965
I fell asleep.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.034
Okay, well, we gotta
take the blanket off.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.035
Aw, do we have to?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.302
The bird remembers every insult

14:29.336 --> 14:30.570
Carol ever yelled at me.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.671
It's like being married again.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.440
(squawks)
Tom has a flat butt.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.441
Flat-butt Tom.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.443
I do not have a flat butt.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.078
(squawks)
Flat-butt Tom.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.679
Yeah? You're the one
with a weird butt.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.614
It's just feathers
and a hole!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.550
You don't understand.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.185
That bird keeps us up
all night long.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.453
Then I have to spend all day

14:46.486 --> 14:48.155
cooking these special
noodles for him.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.522
Oh, and if they're
not cooked properly,

14:49.556 --> 14:51.491
he gets bird diarrhea.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.060
Okay?
Last night, our living room

14:53.093 --> 14:55.095
looked like Jackson
Pollock stopped by.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.330
And had diarrhea.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.267
This hasn't been easy for me,
either, all right?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.534
I mean, I had no idea

15:01.568 --> 15:03.336
how expensive
this thing would be.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.472
His eyedrops alone
cost $200.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.240
Oh, yeah, about that--

15:07.274 --> 15:08.708
I'm not putting
those in anymore.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.310
No, no, no, no.
You have to.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.611
Every time I try, he pecks

15:11.644 --> 15:12.445
my hair out
and it hurts, Nathan.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.613
How would you like

15:13.646 --> 15:15.082
losing your hair
one clump at a time?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.116
Ow!

15:16.149 --> 15:18.085
(gasps)
Ow!

15:18.118 --> 15:19.619
Ow! You let go.
You let go!

15:19.652 --> 15:20.954
This hair is on the news.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.489
(grunts)
Okay, fine, fine!

15:22.522 --> 15:23.723
Fine!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.125
Ow! Gosh.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.459
I'll do the drops.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.261
What is your problem?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.430
TOM:
No, you shut up!

15:30.463 --> 15:32.465
That bird is a jerk.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.737
Do you think I have a flat butt?
I don't know, Dad.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.672
(squawking)
I tried to look at it
in the bathroom mirror,

15:39.706 --> 15:41.608
but I had to jump up
higher than the sink

15:41.641 --> 15:42.642
and I'm not in the air
long enough

15:42.675 --> 15:44.644
to get a good look.
(squawking)

15:44.677 --> 15:45.612
Do we have a camera?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.316
I got one.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.553
And I'm going
back in for two.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.663
I like that restaurant.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.532
Next time, can we take Cappy?

16:05.565 --> 16:08.368
Well, they had an open
pizza oven that was very hot,

16:08.401 --> 16:11.238
plus some dangerous
ceiling fans, so... maybe.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.605
(light, upbeat music plays)

16:12.639 --> 16:16.109
Uh, honey, did you leave
the TV on for Cappy?

16:20.147 --> 16:23.116
Artie...?!
The front door was unlocked.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.086
I thought I locked it.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.621
I've been freeing up some space
on your DVR.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.492
You already saw The Bachelorette
finale, right?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.327
(groans)

16:34.361 --> 16:35.395
Nope.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.297
Well, she gave someone a rose.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.798
Yeah... (groans)

16:38.831 --> 16:42.302
Hey, Deb, I was telling Ray
about Cappy's eyedrops,

16:42.335 --> 16:44.104
and he said
that he'll give it a try.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.638
Yeah, I like birds.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.674
I worked on a documentary
in the rain forest.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.143
I got real friendly
with a cockatoo
named Jennifer,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.179
and I taught her how
to whistle "La Cucaracha."

16:52.212 --> 16:53.713
And I'm pretty sure
she taught me how

16:53.746 --> 16:55.648
to say "I love you"
in "bird."

16:55.682 --> 16:57.284
He's in Mikayla's room.
Good luck with that.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.354
So...

17:01.388 --> 17:03.623
couldn't find
the spoons?
Nope.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.726
But, uh, you found
the peanut butter okay?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.396
Yep.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.632
Hey, Cappy's gone!

17:12.665 --> 17:14.567
What?
The bedroom window
was open.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.702
He must have escaped.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.238
No! Cappy can't be gone!

17:19.739 --> 17:22.242
I'm gonna pick up the pieces.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.714
Don't worry, I speak "bird."

17:27.747 --> 17:28.648
I'm gonna find him.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.583
(squawking)

17:30.617 --> 17:32.285
Hey, little buddy,
where you at?!

17:32.319 --> 17:34.187
(squawking)

17:34.221 --> 17:35.655
Mr. Parrot!

17:35.688 --> 17:36.689
(squawking)

17:38.658 --> 17:40.527
Hey, what is the deal
with you letting Cappy go?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.295
I thought that we agreed
to tough it out.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.664
Me?! I bet you're
the one who did this.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.733
You've been complaining
about spending all the money.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.302
Oh, please, I paid your rent
for the last two years.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.771
If I cared about money,
I would have opened a window

17:51.804 --> 17:53.406
and let you fly
out of here.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.607
Okay, fine. Well, if it wasn't
either of us,

17:54.641 --> 17:56.209
then-then who else
would have done it?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.610
Dad?

17:57.644 --> 17:58.678
Wasn't me.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.747
If I wanted
to get rid of that bird,

18:00.780 --> 18:02.715
I wouldn't be doing two hours
of glute exercises a night.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.551
Okay, well,
then who did it?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.687
Why is Ray perched at
the top of your oak tree?

18:07.720 --> 18:13.693
(Ray squawking to the tune
of "La Cucaracha")

18:14.794 --> 18:17.497
It was you.
Excuse me?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.766
You did it again,
didn't you? But why?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.535
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.304
The bird!
You got rid of him again!

18:24.337 --> 18:25.705
Please.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.674
Mom...

18:27.707 --> 18:30.109
did you give the bird
back to the witch?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.813
Answer me.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.215
You want answers?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.683
I think we're
entitled to them.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.685
You want answers?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.220
We want the truth!

18:40.253 --> 18:43.390
You can't handle the truth!

18:43.423 --> 18:45.258
Son, you live in a family
where people make mistakes.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.826
Big mistakes.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.496
Like idiot fathers buying
parrots for their children.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.731
And someone needs to clean up
after those mistakes.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.699
And who's gonna do it?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.367
You? You?

18:54.401 --> 18:55.402
You?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.569
As your mother,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.338
I have a greater responsibility

18:58.371 --> 19:01.674
than you can possibly fathom!

19:01.708 --> 19:04.777
You can all try to hide from me
that you aren't miserable

19:04.811 --> 19:07.247
with this bird
back in your life,

19:07.280 --> 19:08.748
but a mother knows.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.317
You weep
for your precious Cappy

19:10.350 --> 19:13.320
and you curse my methods.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.488
You had that luxury.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.757
You had the luxury
of not knowing what I do.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.627
My existence,
while sometimes grotesque

19:20.660 --> 19:22.362
and incomprehensible
to you,

19:22.395 --> 19:24.797
is good for this family!

19:24.831 --> 19:26.833
You don't want the truth,

19:26.866 --> 19:29.836
because, deep down,
you want me at that window.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.438
You need me at that window.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.806
I have neither the time
nor the inclination

19:33.840 --> 19:35.675
to explain myself

19:35.708 --> 19:38.845
to a family who rises
and sleeps under the blanket

19:38.878 --> 19:40.847
of the parrot-free lifestyle
I provide,

19:40.880 --> 19:44.384
then questions the manner
in which I provide it!

19:44.417 --> 19:47.954
I'd rather you just said
thank you and went on your way.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.989
Did you give the bird
back to the witch?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.624
I did what
any good mother would do.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.859
Did you give the bird back
to the witch?!

19:52.892 --> 19:56.263
You're gosh darn right I did!

20:03.903 --> 20:06.873
That bird was tearing
this family apart.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.308
Thank you.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.842
Thank you.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.210
Thank you.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.948
See? I told you
you would all thank me.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.351
I wasn't wrong, was I?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.752
You know why?

20:19.786 --> 20:22.689
I'm never wrong.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.857
No-no-no-no-no,
this is wrong.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.493
What about Mikayla?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.927
She loves that bird,
and now she's gonna think

20:27.960 --> 20:29.762
that she left the window open,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.698
and she's gonna blame herself
for the rest of her life.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.032
And then
she's gonna marry Artie,

20:33.065 --> 20:34.901
and I'm gonna have to tell him
that I love him.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.603
And I'm a terrible liar.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.970
And he's just gonna see
right through that,

20:38.004 --> 20:39.572
and I'm never gonna see
my grandkids.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.807
Did you ever think
of that, Carol?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.809
Oh, I thought of that.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.012
Who do you think left
your front door unlocked?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.747
Artie let Cappy out!

20:47.780 --> 20:49.949
There's peanut butter
all over the window!

20:49.982 --> 20:54.454
It's better when the collateral
damage lands outside the family.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.923
I swear, I was on the
couch the whole time!

20:56.956 --> 20:59.559
Leave and never come back!

21:03.830 --> 21:04.831
Thank you!

21:04.864 --> 21:04.931
