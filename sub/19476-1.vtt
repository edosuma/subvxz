01:33.725 --> 01:37.807
Dad, Mom, how are you?

01:39.188 --> 01:43.395
The stars are shining down on your son!

01:43.901 --> 01:45.317
Take care of yourself.

01:46.196 --> 01:50.070
As an undergraduate in Beijing,
I studied the famous Reiser model.

01:53.496 --> 01:55.995
Don't forget to write, ok?

01:57.209 --> 02:00.958
Now I have the honor
to work for the great man himself.

02:01.045 --> 02:04.711
Under his supervision,
I will make important discoveries,

02:05.801 --> 02:08.342
and bring honor to our family.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.445
Liu Xing?
- Here!

02:36.082 --> 02:38.206
Oh, come in.

02:38.334 --> 02:41.458
Liu Xing? Am I saying that right?
- Yes.

02:41.548 --> 02:44.797
This is the highest score we've ever had
on the qualifying exam, you know that?

02:45.718 --> 02:47.384
Yes.

02:47.469 --> 02:50.927
It's a great pleasure to meet you,
Professor Reiser.

02:51.016 --> 02:53.598
We don't go for all that formality here.
Just call me Jake.

02:53.686 --> 02:56.393
Sit down.
- Thank you. Thank you.

02:56.481 --> 03:02.855
Have you read my cosmic string theory?
- I read about it in Beijing. Very good.

03:03.028 --> 03:04.777
Uh huh. Good, good.

03:04.863 --> 03:07.279
So, sit down, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Thank you.

03:07.407 --> 03:10.739
What we're doing here is we're creating
a model, a computer model

03:10.995 --> 03:12.744
of the early universe based on my theory.

03:12.831 --> 03:15.913
Have you done any
computer model work in Beijing?

03:16.001 --> 03:22.125
Uh, yes, but very basic,
because computer there is very slow.

03:22.216 --> 03:25.256
Hmm. Well, ours here are very fast.
State-of-the-art as a matter of fact.

03:25.387 --> 03:26.511
Until next week.

03:27.848 --> 03:29.513
Yeah, I think so.

03:30.892 --> 03:32.766
So how would you like to join our team?

03:35.021 --> 03:37.812
It would be my great honor.
- Okay. All right.

03:37.899 --> 03:41.648
Listen, my assistant Hildy will get you
set up with all the redshift data

03:41.737 --> 03:45.319
and everything you need with the
computers. And welcome to the team.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.824
My door is always open.
- Thank you, Professor Reiser.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.284
Just call me Jake.
- Thank you, Professor Jake.

03:51.413 --> 03:53.162
Okay.
Could you close the door on your way out?

03:53.250 --> 03:56.457
Yes, thank you.
- Okay. Welcome to the team.

03:56.544 --> 03:57.668
Thank you.
- Okay.

03:57.754 --> 04:00.586
Ah. Good meeting? Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:00.674 --> 04:05.757
Redshift data. Reiser Model.
- Thank you.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.802
Okay. Codes.
- Thank you.

04:08.890 --> 04:10.764
You know where the lab is?
- Yes. Thank you.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.058
Down the hall, to the left.
Okay, bye.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.488
EARTH

05:05.994 --> 05:09.993
Are you new?
- Hello.

05:10.248 --> 05:13.289
Have you eaten?
- Yes. Hello.

05:46.328 --> 05:49.660
Take the cable.
- Put it back.

05:49.748 --> 05:53.163
Why?
- Don't you get it? It's private property!

05:53.254 --> 05:55.836
How can airwaves be private?

05:55.921 --> 05:59.629
You can ask the cops on your way to jail.

05:59.761 --> 06:04.135
They love arguing these technicalities.

06:04.472 --> 06:06.596
Bullshit.

06:12.232 --> 06:14.564
I'm coming. Oh, yeah!
Keep turning it, just like that.

06:14.651 --> 06:17.066
Picture, picture, Old Wu!

06:17.154 --> 06:21.069
Yes. Oh, I'm coming.
Oh, yeah!

06:22.660 --> 06:23.950
Oh my God, I'm gonna come!

06:24.035 --> 06:26.159
Can't we just get a new TV?

06:26.246 --> 06:27.912
You're gonna make me come!

06:29.834 --> 06:32.375
I'm coming!
Oh, yeah! Oh, God!

06:32.462 --> 06:35.003
I'm cumming. I'm cumming. I'm cumming.

06:35.089 --> 06:40.047
Why are they always saying "I'm coming"?
Where are they going?

06:40.137 --> 06:42.511
You don't know?

06:42.638 --> 06:48.470
It means "rain clouds gathering
about to burst".

06:48.603 --> 06:50.102
I'm coming.

06:50.898 --> 06:53.522
Welcome to Bible Study.

06:53.693 --> 06:56.025
I am Reverend Hollings.

06:56.110 --> 06:59.984
And today, we have food
provided by the Auxiliary,

07:00.075 --> 07:04.074
which I thought
we would have afterwards, but...

07:04.163 --> 07:06.829
Or we can do it this way.

07:08.041 --> 07:12.998
I see we have three new students here.
Welcome.

07:13.129 --> 07:16.170
Let's do our study. Yes?
Behold...

07:16.258 --> 07:20.091
I hear the church does a lot
to help foreign students.

07:20.345 --> 07:27.385
We can get a free ride to the supermarket
and buy some cheap stuff.

07:28.731 --> 07:30.688
They also give away furniture.

07:30.774 --> 07:32.190
The King said to the servants...

07:32.273 --> 07:36.772
Oh, here you are.
- Hey. Hello, Mrs. Silver.

07:37.949 --> 07:40.156
Oh my God,
am I interrupting a little prayer?

07:40.242 --> 07:41.574
No, I think I made it... I'm late.

07:41.701 --> 07:45.367
Okay. I thought I was early.
- Uh, no, it's, it's just, it's just fine.

07:45.456 --> 07:46.497
Let me introduce you.

07:46.582 --> 07:51.456
For those of you who haven't met
this lovely lady, this is Joanna Silver,

07:51.544 --> 07:55.168
a great patron of Chinese culture
at the university.

07:55.593 --> 07:57.550
And one of the most caring
members of our community.

07:57.678 --> 08:01.302
Very elaborate introduction
for somebody who's just a driver.

08:01.389 --> 08:03.346
I'm here for the field trip.
Does anybody want to go?

08:03.433 --> 08:07.516
Yes, the field trip.
- We should probably take off fairly soon.

08:07.605 --> 08:09.396
Oh, look at how many there are.
- Yes.

08:09.775 --> 08:12.232
Here he is.
I thought you might have forgotten us.

08:12.318 --> 08:14.276
No, no, no, no.
My meeting went late. I'm sorry.

08:14.361 --> 08:18.110
Okay. Anyways.
So some of you can get in here.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.908
And we'll go...
Get in there, three, three in there.

08:21.996 --> 08:25.453
Where are we going?
- Pioneer Village. You'll love it.

08:25.707 --> 08:27.873
Thank you for doing this. Yes?

08:28.335 --> 08:31.293
What's the name of the car?
- Oh, it's a Jaguar.

08:31.380 --> 08:35.171
Jaguar.
- Yes, we should probably all get in.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.759
Uh, could I sit here?

08:36.845 --> 08:41.385
Yes, you could sit there,
but let me just open the... Oh!

08:41.472 --> 08:42.889
Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:42.975 --> 08:45.599
Pile in, fellows. Okay. Very good.

08:45.728 --> 08:48.186
How many miles per gallon?
- Miles per gallon?

08:48.273 --> 08:51.397
Who would ask me that?
I have no idea. Sorry.

08:51.486 --> 08:53.860
So, you'll follow me. Right?
- Okay. Bye bye.

08:53.947 --> 08:55.571
Oh, God.

08:58.408 --> 09:03.199
Cool sound system! What's the music?
- it's Bach. Do you like it?

09:03.288 --> 09:04.329
I like it.
- Bach?

09:04.416 --> 09:08.207
I know him.
Bach's harmonies are very mathematical.

09:08.377 --> 09:11.460
Yes, but at times very moving too,
I think.

09:11.756 --> 09:15.922
To me, mathematics can be very moving.
I am scientist.

09:16.637 --> 09:20.886
You certainly are.
All right, seatbelts.

09:20.975 --> 09:22.015
Go!

09:24.229 --> 09:27.978
Did the cowboys live here?
- Cowboys lived here?

09:28.065 --> 09:30.147
Oh, no. Actually, no.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.694
This is all a reproduction. it's a fake.

09:36.783 --> 09:38.532
There should be a cowboy.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.160
Yeah, it would be more fun
if there were cowboys.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.246
But, you see, the first people
who settled here were homesteaders.

09:45.335 --> 09:49.959
They were farmers, and they had sheep
and they had cattle and...

09:50.046 --> 09:53.545
No, they didn't have cattle.
They had crops and I don't know what else.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.926
In the shop there are souvenirs.

09:57.014 --> 10:01.804
There are cowboy things
like guns and things.

10:59.622 --> 11:02.996
I wonder who
the fastest gun in the East is.

11:04.336 --> 11:06.168
I guess we'll never know.

11:18.602 --> 11:19.642
Hmm.

11:20.185 --> 11:23.809
Professor Reiser.
- Call me Jake.

11:23.940 --> 11:28.106
Now, we're cookin' with gas.
- Thank you.

11:28.193 --> 11:31.734
Listen. Do you think you could get
to the next stage by tomorrow?

11:31.824 --> 11:34.156
'Cause I have a journal deadline.

11:34.244 --> 11:36.118
Of course. No problem.
- No problem?

11:36.204 --> 11:37.911
No problem.
- Great.

11:38.414 --> 11:39.622
Thank you, Professor Reiser.

11:39.706 --> 11:41.538
How do you say I love Beijing in Chinese?

11:43.461 --> 11:46.793
I love Beijing students.

11:46.922 --> 11:49.296
Thank you, Professor Reiser.
- Thank you.

11:50.427 --> 11:55.135
Let's get out of here.
- Yeah. I'm late for my night job.

12:43.524 --> 12:48.731
Why is he sleeping here?
- No idea. Let's wake him up.

12:49.699 --> 12:52.198
Comrades!
Good morning.

12:52.286 --> 12:56.035
We must strengthen our body
to protect our country!

12:56.623 --> 12:59.039
The People's exercise starts now!

13:10.303 --> 13:14.719
What time is it?
- it's past 8:00.

13:20.022 --> 13:22.396
Liu Xing. Morning.
- Hi. Morning.

13:22.484 --> 13:26.524
What are you doing so early?
You look exhausted.

13:26.614 --> 13:30.154
I have this most urgently
for Professor Reiser.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.158
Oh, well, no, you don't
need to see him now.

13:33.245 --> 13:38.244
You should be home in bed.
- He need it for article deadline.

13:38.335 --> 13:41.209
That doesn't need to be in
till Thursday afternoon.

13:41.713 --> 13:46.337
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive. I'm sure.

13:46.676 --> 13:49.342
Oh.
- Yeah. You have time.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.594
Okay.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.221
Do you want to wait for him?
- Yes.

13:52.307 --> 13:55.973
Okay. He should be here very soon.
All right? - Okay.

14:05.196 --> 14:07.279
Professor Reiser!

14:07.364 --> 14:08.405
Hi.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.282
I have finished.
- You're done?

14:11.369 --> 14:14.118
Yes.
- So early?

14:14.204 --> 14:15.412
Yes.

14:16.666 --> 14:23.956
You see, in second run I adjust the
parameter of Omega for a better result.

14:25.217 --> 14:28.966
This is excellent work, Liu Xing.
- Thank you.

14:29.096 --> 14:34.220
I'm giving a talk at the Early Universe
Symposium a little later this summer.

14:34.310 --> 14:36.934
Would you like to join me?
- Thank you very much.

14:37.021 --> 14:38.145
Yeah?
- Yes.

14:38.231 --> 14:42.022
Great food, free booze and beautiful,
albeit high-strung women.

14:42.153 --> 14:45.152
Strong.
- Strung.

14:45.239 --> 14:47.030
Hot chicks. Okay?
- Hot chicks?

14:47.158 --> 14:49.865
Thank you, Professor Reiser.
- Jake. Call me Jake.

14:49.954 --> 14:52.994
Thank you.
- Jake.

14:53.121 --> 14:55.704
Dad, Mom , how are you?

14:58.044 --> 15:02.835
I've been very lucky recently.

15:02.924 --> 15:07.215
I am the number one assistant
to Professor Reiser.

15:07.305 --> 15:11.471
Also, I met a nice Lady named Joanna
who loves Chinese culture.

15:11.560 --> 15:16.017
There's plenty of food here.
Please don't send any more.

15:16.188 --> 15:19.020
I read in the papers

15:19.151 --> 15:25.442
American kids watch
over 30 hours of TV every week.

15:27.450 --> 15:30.699
And at 1 3 they're already doing "it".

15:30.786 --> 15:35.702
Where do they find time?
- Those Americans are efficient.

15:35.791 --> 15:41.665
Maybe they do homework
while watching TV and doing "it" too.

15:41.759 --> 15:44.216
Our Liu Xing knows nothing but studying.

15:45.051 --> 15:47.175
That boy's been putting in
a lot of all-nighters.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.220
Come on, these kids are grateful
for whatever work I give them.

15:50.308 --> 15:54.016
They come from a place where
astrology is considered a science,

15:54.104 --> 15:55.936
and indoor plumbing a luxury.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.480
Yeah, they've only got
2000 years of civilization on us.

15:58.568 --> 16:00.442
I imagine they think
we are the barbarians.

16:00.529 --> 16:02.944
Your mail.
- Thank you.

16:03.031 --> 16:06.488
Besides, what do you know about it?
You've never even been to China.

16:06.575 --> 16:09.616
I'm a theorist.
I don't have to actually go there.

16:09.704 --> 16:11.745
I don't even like Chinese food.

16:19.798 --> 16:21.880
METAL

16:47.370 --> 16:48.786
Get dressed right away.

16:48.871 --> 16:52.537
I have to leave in 1 5 minutes
and you're taking tickets with Sarah.

16:54.337 --> 16:55.627
No.
- Oh, Hal.

16:55.712 --> 16:57.669
I just... I'll be glad
to pay for more ticket takers.

16:57.756 --> 17:01.255
Oh, no, it's not about writing a check.
It's very important that you be there.

17:01.343 --> 17:05.508
You're a patron of the arts.
Everybody's expecting you and

17:07.849 --> 17:10.765
it's not how I want to spend
my Saturday night.

17:11.686 --> 17:16.019
Taking tickets and being
a big patron of the arts.

17:16.108 --> 17:19.147
I have the Monkey King coming
all the way from Salt Lake City.

17:19.279 --> 17:22.278
I've seen Monkey Kings
from Beijing and Shanghai, so...

17:22.740 --> 17:28.280
I just want to make a connection
with these new Chinese students.

17:28.372 --> 17:31.787
Well, I just don't understand the need
you have to make a connection.

17:32.960 --> 17:38.334
I'm kind of tired of connecting.
I'm kind of connected out.

17:43.930 --> 17:44.971
Okay.

18:32.858 --> 18:37.732
I would like to propose a toast
to our wonderful performers.

18:37.823 --> 18:38.947
Thank you, thank you.

18:39.030 --> 18:43.821
And to our new Chinese students,
who have made their own journey west.

18:43.910 --> 18:46.451
We'd like to welcome you to our country.

18:46.664 --> 18:49.121
Cheers.
- Thank you.

18:51.876 --> 18:56.292
Liu Xing, you should make a toast.
- Start with "On behalf".

19:00.636 --> 19:03.260
On behalf of Chinese students,

19:03.389 --> 19:08.972
so lucky to come to America,
the beautiful country.

19:09.062 --> 19:13.436
May we all find our dream here.
- Hear, hear.

19:13.525 --> 19:18.149
Therefore. Therefore.
- And therefore...

19:19.491 --> 19:23.823
Therefore, we make this toast
to our new American friends.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.579
Cheers. Up the bottoms.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.209
Bottoms up. Yes, yes.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.089
What's so funny?

19:41.640 --> 19:45.805
You working tonight?

19:45.894 --> 19:49.768
Yeah, this is my dinner.

19:49.856 --> 19:54.147
Stuff yourself then.
- That's what I'm doing.

20:04.540 --> 20:08.289
Looking at the stars?

20:08.377 --> 20:11.126
I'm looking at the Dark Matter.

20:12.464 --> 20:16.713
Oh, you mean space.

20:16.968 --> 20:19.092
it isn't all space.

20:19.305 --> 20:24.970
There is stuff we can't see,
even with the most powerful telescope.

20:25.060 --> 20:29.684
But we know it is there.
Because of gravitational effect.

20:32.570 --> 20:39.777
Picture the universe as a mountain range.
Only the highest peaks get snow.

20:39.867 --> 20:45.366
These snowy peaks are stars and the
galaxies we can see through our telescope.

20:45.500 --> 20:49.124
But these are just
the tiniest part of the universe.

20:49.212 --> 20:54.919
Maybe one percent.
The rest of the mountain is Dark Matter.

20:55.010 --> 20:59.134
99 percent of the universe, Dark Matter.

21:00.015 --> 21:05.889
But no one pays attention to it,
because they can't see it.

21:07.356 --> 21:11.271
I can see it with mathematics.

21:11.361 --> 21:16.943
I can use mathematics
to see the whole dark mountain.

21:20.996 --> 21:25.286
Academics make $50,000 a year, tops.

21:25.375 --> 21:28.332
Private industry pays twice that.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.461
Plus you get royalties, too.

21:32.925 --> 21:38.591
Go get the ball. Put it back quick.
- Who won?

21:38.680 --> 21:40.096
What industry?

21:40.183 --> 21:45.599
Pharmaceuticals.
I'm going to find a cure for AI DS.

21:47.565 --> 21:50.689
Why are you always winning?
- What about you?

21:50.778 --> 21:55.152
I'll definitely be a millionaire.

21:56.076 --> 22:01.367
I'm going to solve the Dark Matter
Problem, win the Nobel Prize,

22:01.456 --> 22:04.580
and marry a blond,
blue-eyed American girl.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.124
Dark Matter again.
You have a one track mind.

23:13.742 --> 23:15.366
Now what can I do for you?

23:21.125 --> 23:24.415
I want a cup of tea.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.669
Any particular kind?

23:27.673 --> 23:29.506
Which one is the best?

23:29.593 --> 23:33.550
Gosh, I don't know.
I'm more of a coffee drinker myself, but

23:33.679 --> 23:37.012
We have lots to choose from.

23:37.101 --> 23:42.267
Okay, I would like a togo.

23:42.439 --> 23:46.313
Togo?
- Togo. There?

23:46.485 --> 23:49.567
Oh! To go.
- To go, to go.

23:49.697 --> 23:51.988
Sure, no problem.

24:06.256 --> 24:08.838
Here.
- Thank you.

24:08.927 --> 24:10.884
You're welcome.

24:14.514 --> 24:16.971
Oh, sorry.
- it's okay.

24:17.059 --> 24:19.016
Sorry, sorry.

24:22.731 --> 24:24.480
Are you a student here?

24:24.567 --> 24:25.607
Me?
- Yes.

24:25.735 --> 24:30.234
No. Not anymore.
Are you?

24:30.533 --> 24:32.615
Yes. Cosmology.

24:33.077 --> 24:34.867
Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

24:34.953 --> 24:39.243
Wow. Hey, maybe you could
give me a free makeover.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.459
I think so.

24:45.091 --> 24:46.881
Well, it goes something like this.

24:46.967 --> 24:50.007
A theorist and an experimentalist
were on death row.

24:50.096 --> 24:51.886
He's going to tell a joke.
- Where they belong.

24:51.972 --> 24:55.054
Right.
- Most of them.

24:55.142 --> 24:58.308
And the guard asked them
for their last wish.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.645
So the theorist says,
I'd like to give a seminar,

25:01.773 --> 25:06.022
to present my latest theoretical
breakthrough. - Before they die.

25:06.112 --> 25:09.652
And then the guard asks
the experimentalist, who says,

25:09.784 --> 25:12.200
I'd like to be executed
before the seminar.

25:15.997 --> 25:17.037
He got it.

25:17.124 --> 25:20.331
All right, everybody,
we have to all thank Joanna

25:20.419 --> 25:23.668
for how well she's taken care of
all of our Chinese students.

25:24.632 --> 25:29.672
And I've heard about the high cultural
experiences of the Pioneer Village,

25:29.805 --> 25:32.971
the Cineplex... High culture.

25:33.056 --> 25:37.264
Oh, everyone had fun, didn't you?
- Oh, a great time.

25:37.562 --> 25:42.270
I think it's important for everyone
to get out of that lab we gave you.

25:42.442 --> 25:45.608
Ah ha. Yeah, yes.

25:45.695 --> 25:47.861
Which we are very grateful
to you and Hal for.

25:47.948 --> 25:51.447
And I think we are incubating some
truly remarkable scientists here.

25:51.536 --> 25:53.243
Liu Xing?
- Yes?

25:53.328 --> 25:56.577
We let you out sometimes, don't we?
- Yes.

25:56.667 --> 26:00.916
And Professor Reiser is very inspire me.

26:01.338 --> 26:02.754
He's a diplomat, too.

26:04.508 --> 26:08.257
To me. Inspiring to me.
- Inspiring to me.

26:08.344 --> 26:12.093
And Dark Matter is also
still very inspiring to you.

26:12.183 --> 26:16.390
What do you know about Dark Matter?
I thought science didn't interest you.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.104
Well, no. I mean, I am
more interested in the cultural side,

26:20.191 --> 26:24.398
but Liu Xing explained it to me
very eloquently the other day.

26:24.487 --> 26:25.903
And it made sense.

26:27.491 --> 26:29.782
Maybe I should hire him
to do my fundraising.

26:32.413 --> 26:35.079
Speaking of Dark Matter, look at that.

26:36.585 --> 26:39.417
But it is very interesting, Dark Matter.
- Yes.

26:39.502 --> 26:45.293
Motions of stars and the galaxies,
all determined by Dark Matter around it.

26:45.386 --> 26:49.760
Like a dark...
Like a dark hollow.

26:49.889 --> 26:51.097
Hollow?
- Hollow.

26:51.350 --> 26:53.307
Halo, like an angel.

26:53.394 --> 26:57.143
Hon, maybe we should get
some after-dinner drinks for everybody.

26:57.230 --> 26:58.645
Liu Xing?

26:59.942 --> 27:03.524
They're going to go smoke. You smoke?
- I don't.

27:04.070 --> 27:08.902
She's probably gonna kill me for this.
I'll survive.

27:10.495 --> 27:14.452
Professor Reiser,
are you afraid of your wife?

27:16.918 --> 27:21.584
Uh, no.
Just about the cigar smell.

27:21.672 --> 27:24.421
Drinking a problem?
- No.

27:31.977 --> 27:33.768
Who's that?

27:33.853 --> 27:38.060
Oh. That's my advisor, Dr. Gazda.

27:38.149 --> 27:42.481
Your advisor?
- Yeah, I was about your age then.

27:42.571 --> 27:47.237
After I graduated I published a critique
of his Black Hole Accretion Flows Theory.

27:47.327 --> 27:49.993
I read this paper. Very good.

27:50.079 --> 27:51.328
You did?
- Yeah.

27:51.415 --> 27:55.164
Well, he didn't seem to think so.
But that's how it goes.

27:56.044 --> 27:59.543
in China, this would never happen.
- What?

27:59.631 --> 28:03.130
Student never challenge the teacher.

28:03.218 --> 28:07.384
Have too much respect.

28:07.472 --> 28:11.846
It's a big problem,
Because no challenge, no progress.

28:11.978 --> 28:14.477
Well, you feel free
to challenge me all you want.

28:14.565 --> 28:20.480
Just remember, I'm always right.
- I think so.

28:20.570 --> 28:23.569
Oh, drink that slowly.
It'll go straight to your head.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.532
Drink it slow.
- Slow.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.731
I love that song.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.071
You know this?
- Yes. It's my favorite song.

29:04.157 --> 29:06.698
I love that song.
- Your favorite?

29:25.432 --> 29:27.515
I don't know what it means.

29:28.643 --> 29:31.725
Something about the

29:33.314 --> 29:38.980
Blue sky and white cloud...

29:41.532 --> 29:44.906
No problem.
- Flowed by...

29:49.082 --> 29:52.998
Beneath the white cloud

29:53.128 --> 29:56.460
A sheep as white as snow.

29:57.425 --> 30:00.924
Under the white...

30:04.724 --> 30:11.182
Under the white sheep...
- No, not under the white sheep.

30:17.611 --> 30:21.902
Cosmic strings continues to be
the most elegant explanation

30:21.992 --> 30:25.325
of how the galaxies have emerged
from the beginning of time.

30:25.453 --> 30:29.535
And with my revised model,
we will be able to reproduce

30:29.624 --> 30:37.248
any and all of the observed large-scale
structures of the entire universe.

30:42.262 --> 30:44.595
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

30:44.681 --> 30:48.972
Obviously we're not there yet, but...
Yes, my old professor, Dr. Gazda?

30:50.146 --> 30:53.145
Yes, I am going to invoke
the privilege of an old teacher

30:53.235 --> 30:56.942
and chastise my former pupil.

30:58.490 --> 31:02.780
Why am I not surprised?
- Some things never change, Jake.

31:02.870 --> 31:05.035
Once again,
you're in denial about the data.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.037
Have you seen the latest
redshift images from the CSA?

31:08.167 --> 31:11.500
Yes, as a matter of fact I have.
Would you like to share it with everyone?

31:11.586 --> 31:12.835
By all means.
- Go ahead.

31:12.922 --> 31:18.338
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a model.
This is reality.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.596
Now, where are these voids
in your model, Jake?

31:24.684 --> 31:28.808
Um, what are these? Daisy chains?

31:31.108 --> 31:33.065
It's insignificant.
- What?

31:33.194 --> 31:35.485
That's the trouble with you theorists.

31:35.613 --> 31:37.404
You get so caught up
in your computer models

31:37.490 --> 31:40.447
that you forget to open your eyes
and look up and see the truth.

31:40.535 --> 31:43.200
It's staring you in the face.

31:43.287 --> 31:48.952
You're reminding me of the old joke about
the theorist and the experimentalist.

31:49.043 --> 31:54.458
These two transparencies are a work
in progress, but you are forcing my hand.

31:54.549 --> 31:59.714
Let me show you something here,
that I think may give even you pause.

31:59.806 --> 32:04.763
You can see how even a slight
temperature change in the Dark Matter

32:04.851 --> 32:11.350
could and probably would
cause these voids, over time.

32:12.651 --> 32:16.650
Yeah, it's a Band-Aid.
- Ha!

32:16.739 --> 32:18.863
But an elegant one. Yes?

32:21.579 --> 32:24.286
I said in 1 933
Observe the Coma cluster

32:24.373 --> 32:26.872
The redshifts of the galaxies
imply some big velocities

32:26.960 --> 32:29.459
They're moving so fast
They must be missing mass

32:29.545 --> 32:33.294
Dark Matter - do we need it?
What is it? Where is it?

32:33.383 --> 32:36.674
Thank you. it's very nice.

32:36.761 --> 32:40.344
Oh, maybe he wants some.
Barry?

32:41.309 --> 32:43.016
Good to see you.

32:43.100 --> 32:47.474
Come on. Now, Liu Xing,
take a look at this woman.

32:47.564 --> 32:51.271
Now, this is America.
Try this. Try this drink. Put that away.

32:51.362 --> 32:54.361
Try that, drink it slowly.
Take a look.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.962
Liu Xing, I've been looking
all over for you.

33:13.050 --> 33:16.549
That was you who saved Jake's derriere
this morning, wasn't it?

33:16.637 --> 33:20.052
I thought you did some marvelous work.

33:20.143 --> 33:23.892
We both come from cultures that propose
a universe with no beginning and no end.

33:23.978 --> 33:28.144
Yet here we are, discussing the Big Bang,
the ultimate beginning.

33:28.233 --> 33:34.857
But maybe there have been
many beginnings, many big bangs.

33:35.366 --> 33:39.657
You know, Liu Xing, I really think you
should focus on this Dark Matter problem.

33:39.746 --> 33:42.828
I think you could do some serious damage.

33:42.915 --> 33:47.372
Lies, lies, lies. Don't believe
a word that this man says.

33:47.461 --> 33:50.377
But we're talking about you,
you egomaniac.

33:51.966 --> 33:55.507
I was just telling Liu Xing I think he
should focus on this Dark Matter problem.

33:55.595 --> 33:57.011
He has a real passion for it.

33:57.097 --> 33:59.721
He'd better have a real passion for it.
He works for me.

34:00.392 --> 34:04.683
You work for me, don't you?
Yes. He works for me.

34:04.773 --> 34:06.730
The search is getting popular
As many realize

34:06.817 --> 34:09.857
That the detector of Dark Matter
May well win the Nobel Prize

34:12.487 --> 34:15.779
Dad, Mom , how are you?

34:17.369 --> 34:21.993
Professor Reiser invited me to attend
the Early Universe Symposium.

34:22.791 --> 34:28.540
There I learned that Dark Matter
is the future of cosmology.

34:29.716 --> 34:33.505
Here in America, I am free
to follow my dreams.

34:33.596 --> 34:36.053
I will definitely win the Nobel Prize.

34:45.149 --> 34:47.232
WATER

35:01.833 --> 35:07.124
Eat grape not, spit out grape skin.

35:07.214 --> 35:11.630
Not eat grape yet, spit out skin grape.

35:11.718 --> 35:16.425
Oh! Grape skin! Spit out grape kin.

35:16.515 --> 35:22.305
Eat grape not, spit out grape skin.

35:22.437 --> 35:24.936
Not eat grape yet, spit out grape skin.

35:25.026 --> 35:26.483
Sounds kind of like I never left Shanghai.

35:26.567 --> 35:31.191
Oh, hi!
- Ah, hello!

35:32.658 --> 35:33.948
How you been?

35:34.034 --> 35:36.658
I missed you.
- I missed you.

35:36.745 --> 35:38.327
Did everything go good?
- Oh, really good.

35:38.455 --> 35:43.704
We're this close to two million units.
- Fantastic. What about Mommy?

35:43.794 --> 35:47.959
Oh, it's oolong. it's my favorite.
I just made some oolong. You want some?

35:48.050 --> 35:51.007
No, no thanks.
- You sure?

35:51.093 --> 35:54.009
You want to sit?
- Yeah.

35:54.097 --> 35:55.596
Tell me the news.

35:55.683 --> 35:59.473
Lots going on.
Whole new crop of Chinese students.

35:59.562 --> 36:04.102
And one of them, Laurence Feng, used
to be... Liu Xing, you know, my friend?

36:04.193 --> 36:09.108
His rival at Beijing University.
Number two at Beijing University.

36:10.031 --> 36:11.613
So that's big news.

36:11.701 --> 36:15.908
I'm taking the new students out to Pioneer
Village tomorrow. You want to come?

36:15.996 --> 36:18.704
No, thank you.

36:18.789 --> 36:22.163
Are you gonna dazzle them
with your language skills?

36:22.253 --> 36:24.419
Don't make fun of me.
I'm just...

36:25.715 --> 36:30.505
It's kind of cool. The greatest thing
about trying to learn this language

36:30.595 --> 36:35.135
is how it just really forces you to have
another whole perspective on the world,

36:35.225 --> 36:43.099
because it's so indirect and subtle
and they don't have any tenses.

36:43.191 --> 36:48.065
So, they say, "I am."

36:48.153 --> 36:52.402
And "last year I am",
and "in the future I am".

36:52.533 --> 36:57.991
You know, be here now, sort of.
- Now I am.

38:14.374 --> 38:15.665
Feng Gang.

38:16.793 --> 38:18.625
What happened to you?

38:19.337 --> 38:24.961
Why did you change your name to Laurence?
What kind of name is that?

38:25.258 --> 38:29.132
Yes, my wife thinks it's easier
for Americans to say,

38:29.222 --> 38:30.887
to make them feel more comfortable.

38:38.272 --> 38:42.396
Your theory doesn't work.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.401
Galaxies start forming way too late.

38:45.489 --> 38:49.279
You can't explain quasars
at redshift four.

38:49.369 --> 38:54.659
I know. We can fix that.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.914
You get much better results
with warm Dark Matter,

38:58.002 --> 39:00.917
and inflation instead of cosmic strings.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.089
That's not the Reiser Model.

39:11.184 --> 39:15.600
We should have our
own ideas and language.

39:19.901 --> 39:25.483
But we're all working for Reiser here.

39:35.126 --> 39:37.250
Why did you come here?
- To meet you.

39:37.335 --> 39:40.959
No, I mean, to America.
- Oh, America.

39:41.050 --> 39:45.049
To meet you.
- Seriously.

39:45.137 --> 39:49.136
Seriously, seriously.
I have so much "seriously" all day.

39:51.727 --> 39:55.351
Wait. I will show you the galaxy.

39:55.940 --> 39:57.897
In your cup.

40:00.736 --> 40:04.194
Watch closely.

40:22.760 --> 40:27.551
I figured out that cosmology
has nothing to do with skin care.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.098
You must think I'm an idiot.

40:29.602 --> 40:33.642
Of course ... not.

40:33.770 --> 40:35.769
You study the Big Bang.
- Mm-hmm.

40:35.857 --> 40:38.772
It's supposed to be
the beginning of the universe.

40:40.570 --> 40:42.277
I don't believe it.

40:42.365 --> 40:46.905
Because something had to cause the Big
Bang, it didn't just come from nothing.

40:46.995 --> 40:49.619
What do you think caused the Big Bang?
- God.

40:49.706 --> 40:53.580
Then what caused the God?
He can't come out of nowhere.

40:53.668 --> 40:57.292
He's eternal.
He's always been there.

40:57.380 --> 41:00.795
In my new theory, the universe is eternal.

41:00.886 --> 41:05.010
Big Bang is a major event,
but not beginning.

41:05.096 --> 41:09.012
Universe has no beginning,
no end, just like God.

41:09.102 --> 41:14.559
So you see, we are really the same.
Universe and God is the same.

41:20.990 --> 41:24.156
For my dissertation,
I intend to develop

41:24.242 --> 41:28.949
new non-equilibrium techniques
for the Reiser Model,

41:29.040 --> 41:36.497
running from 1 0 to the minus 36 seconds
to one second after the Big Bang.

41:36.588 --> 41:38.129
That's what I call a dissertation.

41:38.215 --> 41:41.756
impeccable, Laurence.
We look forward to the results.

41:41.885 --> 41:42.926
Thank you.

41:43.012 --> 41:47.178
Liu Xing, I believe, is next, who is being
very secretive about his proposal.

41:47.266 --> 41:49.723
I'm his advisor
and I don't even know what it is.

41:57.446 --> 41:59.861
This kid is quite brilliant.
- This is your boy, huh?

41:59.948 --> 42:04.322
I'm looking forward to being surprised.

42:07.998 --> 42:15.039
At present, the model doesn't explain
large voids seen by observer.

42:15.131 --> 42:16.255
My model?

42:21.094 --> 42:27.009
What if the voids are not empty at all,

42:27.102 --> 42:29.601
but full of Dark Matter?

42:30.396 --> 42:35.520
I will use Superstring Theory
to find a new Dark Matter particle

42:35.610 --> 42:38.317
that su- sur- surpre-
- Suppresses?

42:38.405 --> 42:41.988
Suppresses galaxy formation.

42:45.412 --> 42:49.036
Well, I think I speak for the Chair
and for Professor Small in saying,

42:49.126 --> 42:54.000
we're all impressed with
your tremendous creativity,

42:54.089 --> 42:58.255
but there is no guarantee that Superstring
Theory will predict such a particle.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.592
You need to change
your dissertation proposal

43:00.678 --> 43:04.844
and pick a problem
that you know has an answer.

43:05.393 --> 43:06.433
Okay?

43:08.981 --> 43:12.813
Unless he wants to be a grad student
for the rest of his life.

43:34.965 --> 43:37.506
Why don't you try being more practical?

43:37.635 --> 43:41.009
Just find something that Reiser
will approve, and graduate first.

43:41.097 --> 43:44.388
That doesn't sound like someone
who wants to cure AI DS.

43:44.475 --> 43:48.599
My dissertation is on a molecule
invented by my professor ten years ago.

43:50.399 --> 43:53.106
What a waste of brain cells.

44:32.194 --> 44:35.235
And today, I welcome all of you here,
as one more child...

44:35.323 --> 44:40.655
We have Buddhism, Taoism,
and Confucianism.

44:40.744 --> 44:43.659
Why do they need Jesus?

44:43.789 --> 44:48.330
Do you Laurence, and you Cindy, promise
to raise Noelle in the Christian faith,

44:48.419 --> 44:52.460
and to be an active member of our church?
- We do.

44:52.548 --> 44:54.881
Then through water and through Spirit,

44:54.968 --> 44:59.092
I welcome you to the Christian faith,
to be one of God's own children.

44:59.180 --> 45:06.929
In the name of the Father and the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

45:07.647 --> 45:10.437
Liu Xing!
- Yes?

45:10.526 --> 45:14.608
We're having a party tonight.
You're welcome to come.

45:14.822 --> 45:18.405
Yes. Thank you.
- Say "Uncle Liu Xing".

45:19.494 --> 45:22.951
Feng Gang, congratulations.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.538
All those years in school have paid off.

45:24.625 --> 45:29.499
You've done well for yourself and
such a pretty wife from Shanghai too.

45:29.587 --> 45:31.295
Now I have mouths to feed.

45:31.383 --> 45:34.299
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

45:34.385 --> 45:35.926
Goodbye.

45:48.693 --> 45:54.400
I think she's faking it for our sake.

45:58.453 --> 46:00.910
Sounds real to me.

46:04.710 --> 46:06.792
She's trying to excite us.

46:13.136 --> 46:18.344
A true female orgasm builds slowly.
Very slowly.

46:20.977 --> 46:24.142
A true female orgasm

46:24.231 --> 46:28.355
starts from the bottom of the throat.

46:28.735 --> 46:30.234
it sounds like this.

47:05.940 --> 47:10.106
Got it. I've got it. I've got it!

47:10.237 --> 47:17.403
I've got it! Major breakthrough! Old Wu!
Old Wu! I have a major breakthrough!

47:17.537 --> 47:20.119
Little Square, Little Square!

47:20.249 --> 47:24.623
Sorry. Little Square, Little Square!
- Fuck off, I'm busy!

47:24.795 --> 47:26.294
Come here.

47:30.551 --> 47:34.758
Superstring theory predicts
shadow particles

47:34.846 --> 47:40.345
that interact with ordinary matter
only through gravity.

47:40.437 --> 47:44.019
This is a major breakthrough.
A major breakthrough!

47:44.108 --> 47:48.649
Dark Matter solves
the problems of the Reiser Model.

47:48.738 --> 47:50.446
Dark Matter.

47:56.579 --> 47:59.161
Tell him that
it's against the Journal's Policy.

47:59.290 --> 48:01.789
He'll, he's a bit of a bureaucrat.
He'll understand that kind of talk.

48:01.876 --> 48:04.667
Right, so basically you want me
to do your dirty work for you.

48:04.754 --> 48:06.795
Well
- No, it's fine.

48:06.882 --> 48:09.090
Listen, there are two more things.
- Professor Reiser!

48:09.175 --> 48:12.299
Listen, don't forget tonight, six o'clock.
At six o'clock is the reception.

48:12.388 --> 48:15.137
Call your sister, it's her birthday,
You sent flowers.

48:15.265 --> 48:17.973
Call her, please.
- I sent flowers? How nice of me.

48:18.061 --> 48:23.185
Professor Reiser, huge breakthrough.
Huge breakthrough.

48:23.482 --> 48:26.689
Huge breakthrough?

48:32.785 --> 48:33.826
Huge breakthrough.

48:33.910 --> 48:37.493
Huge breakthrough.
Yes, l, yes, I heard that.

48:37.582 --> 48:41.081
Huge implications for cosmology.

48:48.551 --> 48:51.634
You did this?
- Yes.

48:52.306 --> 48:55.514
Can this be my dissertation?

48:58.145 --> 49:02.644
What are you, out of your mind?
This is way over your head.

49:02.733 --> 49:08.357
Way past your capabilities.
- But I already got a good result.

49:08.447 --> 49:10.946
Liu Xing, let me explain something to you.

49:11.034 --> 49:14.908
This is a marathon.
You cannot sprint all the way. All right?

49:14.996 --> 49:17.870
Pick something simpler,
and then build on that.

49:17.958 --> 49:21.749
You're going to have to learn that you
have to pay your dues first. Okay?

49:24.090 --> 49:30.381
But...
- I said absolutely not. No. Okay?

49:39.856 --> 49:42.939
Dad, Mom , how are you?

49:43.236 --> 49:45.777
Great news!

49:45.863 --> 49:48.571
I've had a major breakthrough.

49:48.866 --> 49:51.657
Professor Reiser is very pleased.

49:52.202 --> 49:56.701
He says this discovery
can be the basis for my Ph. D. thesis.

49:57.123 --> 49:59.872
I will make you proud of me.

50:00.588 --> 50:06.837
I hear American children
don't take care of their parents.

50:06.926 --> 50:12.133
They send them to retirement homes
and let them die there.

50:17.062 --> 50:19.978
Our son would never do that.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.282
WOOD

50:57.732 --> 51:00.856
After generating much important research,

51:00.943 --> 51:05.317
cosmic strings,
first proposed by Jacob Reiser,

51:05.448 --> 51:09.614
no longer explain the observed
structure of the universe.

51:09.704 --> 51:10.745
Hildy!

51:10.828 --> 51:15.661
By using superstrings, I have discovered
a warm Dark Matter particle.

51:15.751 --> 51:17.208
Did you know this was going to happen?

51:17.295 --> 51:19.877
How could I possiblly know?
I am not a mind reader.

51:19.963 --> 51:21.879
You do know.

51:23.342 --> 51:26.216
How dare he?

51:26.304 --> 51:29.011
Without my permission.
Without even showing it to me.

51:29.099 --> 51:32.182
I believe he tried.
- He did not.

51:32.268 --> 51:37.392
He showed me some scribbles on a yellow
legal pad. Why are you siding with him?

51:38.318 --> 51:41.067
Liu Xing worships you. He wanted
your blessing, you didn't give it to him.

51:41.153 --> 51:43.360
That's all that happened.
- Yeah, he's all so respectful,

51:43.489 --> 51:45.530
bowing and obsequious on the outside.

51:45.615 --> 51:49.323
On the inside
he's an arrogant little bastard.

51:50.329 --> 51:52.619
Maybe they all are.

51:52.706 --> 51:57.621
Joanna, Reiser think I'm attacking him.
- Oh.

51:57.712 --> 52:00.086
I'm not attacking him.
- I know you're not.

52:00.172 --> 52:03.088
This can help improve his model.

52:03.177 --> 52:07.009
I was hoping so much
he will publish my article.

52:07.098 --> 52:08.180
I'm sure he will.

52:08.265 --> 52:11.389
And even if he doesn't, we can always
send it out to be published someplace.

52:11.518 --> 52:14.142
Oh, my God. That's...
- Fabulous.

52:14.230 --> 52:18.229
Exactly what I would say.
See, I just wanted something strong.

52:18.319 --> 52:22.151
I can't tell which one of these is his...
- Now, there it is. Sixteen and a half.

52:22.238 --> 52:25.403
I love that, too.
I'll take that.

52:25.535 --> 52:26.993
Oh, sorry.

52:28.828 --> 52:32.744
Oh, no, no, no. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

52:32.834 --> 52:35.291
I think you should have this one.

52:37.714 --> 52:39.338
Too expensive.

52:39.423 --> 52:43.547
The lady has impeccable taste.
- Well, it's only money.

52:43.637 --> 52:46.677
When is your dissertation presentation?
- Next week.

52:46.765 --> 52:49.805
Next week? And you're going
to wear this terrible shirt?

52:49.894 --> 52:51.976
No, no, no, you wear this one.

52:52.063 --> 52:56.729
You walk in, you have confidence,
you look good, you feel good.

52:56.819 --> 52:58.193
Hit it out of the park.

52:59.863 --> 53:01.612
I really don't need that shirt.

53:01.699 --> 53:03.573
No, you don't need it,
but we're going to get it.

53:03.699 --> 53:05.865
Dress for success.

53:07.163 --> 53:09.953
You just worry. You're worrying too much.
You really are.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.955
You know what my mother said?

53:12.042 --> 53:15.499
Worry is interest paid on trouble
that has not happened yet.

53:17.132 --> 53:18.839
So don't worry.

53:22.094 --> 53:25.052
Hey, be careful with my new shirt!

53:26.934 --> 53:29.641
Typical American thinking.

53:32.022 --> 53:36.188
To climb a mountain,
you need hiking shoes.

53:36.277 --> 53:41.109
To ride a bike, you need a helmet.

53:42.700 --> 53:48.115
You can't just drink tap water.
it has to be mineral water.

53:50.541 --> 53:55.540
Even when sleeping,
you have to wear sexy underwear.

54:11.647 --> 54:15.146
That shirt isn't so great.

54:16.237 --> 54:20.652
Dress for success.
Haven't you heard of that?

54:40.679 --> 54:42.137
Liu Xing?

55:01.325 --> 55:08.908
Therefore, this new warm Dark Matter
make a better match to observation,

55:08.999 --> 55:14.581
as you can see
from final frame of simulation.

55:24.726 --> 55:30.309
Did you use single- or
double-precision computation?

55:30.440 --> 55:32.730
Single.
- But...

55:32.818 --> 55:34.983
But even the slightest
computational error,

55:35.070 --> 55:39.610
like a round-off error,
can significantly alter the results.

55:39.742 --> 55:42.866
Results not caused by a round-off error.

55:42.954 --> 55:48.161
So you say, but you have
no way to prove it. Do you?

55:50.670 --> 55:55.586
Professor Reiser,
the simulation is accurate.

55:55.674 --> 56:01.506
Double precision is standard procedure,
Liu Xing. Standard.

56:02.975 --> 56:06.265
But, Professor Reiser...

56:08.273 --> 56:13.314
Why you never tell this to me?

56:13.404 --> 56:18.945
I do one thousand runs for your model,

56:19.033 --> 56:21.491
single precision,

56:21.578 --> 56:27.577
and you never tell this to me.
Never tell me, do different.

56:30.296 --> 56:33.004
Excuse us for a moment.

56:33.092 --> 56:36.674
You have to admit,
it's a highly original piece of work.

56:36.802 --> 56:41.260
Do you really want to sign off on a thesis
that may be entirely inaccurate,

56:41.349 --> 56:45.473
simply because some of
the ideas in it are intriguing?

56:45.562 --> 56:48.853
Come on, Jake.
He made a very persuasive argument.

56:48.940 --> 56:50.439
It's pure speculation.

56:50.527 --> 56:54.942
He took the most speculative theory in
physics and speculated a little further.

56:55.031 --> 56:58.071
He is in way over his head.

56:58.159 --> 57:01.449
Well, maybe he's way over our heads.

57:03.915 --> 57:06.664
Liu Xing, I'm afraid
we can't accept your dissertation

57:06.751 --> 57:09.000
until you redo the computations.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.662
What time is it?

57:42.747 --> 57:44.621
Two o'clock.

58:10.111 --> 58:11.151
Liu Xing!

58:12.362 --> 58:13.402
Liu Xing?

58:18.453 --> 58:21.952
Liu Xing, why aren't you answering?

58:22.039 --> 58:24.038
What's going on?

58:24.126 --> 58:26.208
I'm coming in.

58:55.786 --> 58:57.785
Let's go. You need a haircut.

58:57.872 --> 58:59.496
You've had enough of that.

58:59.582 --> 59:02.706
Come on. Let's go.

01:00:13.075 --> 01:00:18.907
Liu Xing, come back to China with me.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:23.207
I'll get you a job
at the Chinese Science Academy.

01:00:24.255 --> 01:00:31.420
With your abilities and degree you qualify
for a nice apartment in central Beijing.

01:00:31.513 --> 01:00:37.595
Then find a wife who can cook
so you can focus on your research.

01:00:37.687 --> 01:00:39.270
Wouldn't that be great?

01:00:39.353 --> 01:00:45.435
Get a corporate job like me, and you can
research Dark Matter in your spare time.

01:00:45.528 --> 01:00:49.652
Even Einstein had a day job.
Fuck dark matter!

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.582
FIRE

01:01:47.345 --> 01:01:49.885
How are you?
- Good.

01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:52.053
How are you?
- Fine.

01:01:54.353 --> 01:01:56.685
Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:09.447
Happy birthday.

01:02:11.286 --> 01:02:14.285
Liu Xing, who told you it was my birthday?

01:02:14.374 --> 01:02:18.373
Oh, you forget, I am a scientist.
I just know.

01:02:18.461 --> 01:02:21.835
Yeah, well, I see you're
a cosmetologist after all.

01:02:22.673 --> 01:02:29.964
Then please come to my house after work.
I prepare you a birthday feast.

01:02:31.517 --> 01:02:37.224
That's so sweet but I already have plans.
- No problem. Tomorrow.

01:02:37.313 --> 01:02:39.646
I don't think so.

01:02:40.527 --> 01:02:44.442
I like you, Liu Xing.
You're a really nice guy, but I just...

01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:48.071
I don't think
it's going to work out between us.

01:02:48.201 --> 01:02:52.575
I'm sorry.
- No problem.

01:02:58.128 --> 01:03:01.794
Baba, Mama, how are you?

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.840
I am proud to report that I graduated
with the highest honors.

01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:11.221
Soon you'll be living in America with me.

01:03:11.308 --> 01:03:15.223
Then you'll be the proud parents
of Professor Liu Xing.

01:03:15.314 --> 01:03:19.646
Now all the universities
are fighting over me.

01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:23.233
I'm trying to decide
which job offer to accept.

01:03:23.322 --> 01:03:25.404
I miss you both very much.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.406
Here we go. Hello.
Beer, wine, salad, everything's there.

01:03:31.496 --> 01:03:36.620
Everybody, Professor Colby.
Professor Colby has the floor.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:41.377
Thank you, Professor.
I wanted to share some good news with you.

01:03:41.465 --> 01:03:46.880
For the third year running, the
Gelman Prize for best science dissertation

01:03:46.972 --> 01:03:49.137
has been awarded to one of our own.

01:03:49.266 --> 01:03:50.682
Laurence Feng.
- Oh, that's great.

01:03:50.767 --> 01:03:52.641
Take a bow.

01:03:58.525 --> 01:04:05.524
You! You! You! You! You! You! You!

01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:08.699
My God!

01:04:08.787 --> 01:04:13.328
My love,

01:04:13.418 --> 01:04:16.626
As pure as a rose...

01:04:16.713 --> 01:04:20.837
I brought you a present.

01:04:25.304 --> 01:04:30.845
Joanna, I didn't even graduate.

01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:35.101
I didn't say it was a graduation present.

01:04:49.246 --> 01:04:52.162
You like it?
- Yes.

01:04:56.796 --> 01:04:59.503
Very old.
- Yeah.

01:05:08.975 --> 01:05:16.099
Liu Xing, my husband Hal has a business.
He does a lot of business in China.

01:05:16.192 --> 01:05:17.232
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.776
Not in your field.
But it's import export.

01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:27.488
And I know some of the people.
So, I thought I might contact them.

01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:30.871
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:34.415
No problem.
I can find a job myself.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:40.128
Hmm. Of course.
- Thank you.

01:05:40.219 --> 01:05:43.384
So I'm not clear on the protocol now.

01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:46.761
Liu Xing hasn't passed his dissertation

01:05:46.851 --> 01:05:49.808
I'm sure he'll get his doctorate someday.

01:05:52.065 --> 01:05:57.606
I mean, he's a brilliant guy.
But unfortunately he's not a team player.

01:05:58.153 --> 01:06:03.236
Oh. Well, you wouldn't put that
in a letter of recommendation.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.867
No, I wrote him a very fine
recommendation.

01:06:05.954 --> 01:06:08.536
You did?
- Believe me.

01:06:08.624 --> 01:06:13.581
Great. Yeah.
Because I remember when he first came,

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.711
you said he was the most brilliant student
you'd ever seen.

01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:19.923
Yes, and I have no doubt. Yeah.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:24.175
He'll make a lasting contribution
to cosmology someday.

01:06:25.266 --> 01:06:27.723
Somewhere. But...
- Hm.

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:31.059
I wish there were something you could do,
because he looks up to you so much.

01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:38.316
I don't think he still wants
to work for me, Joanna.

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:51.704
Butterfly!

01:06:51.794 --> 01:06:55.543
My butterfly!

01:07:10.733 --> 01:07:15.232
Does he have a girlfriend in America?

01:07:15.321 --> 01:07:18.361
He's too busy.

01:07:20.076 --> 01:07:22.991
Here you go.

01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:28.953
All he knows is studying, like a fool.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:33.294
Who's going to date him?

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:49.018
Liu Xing, right?
I read your article on Dark Matter.

01:07:53.693 --> 01:07:55.775
It's really good.

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.876
Liu Xing!

01:08:51.589 --> 01:08:54.255
Liu Xing, such a surprise.

01:08:54.341 --> 01:08:57.466
Joanna.
- How wonderful to see you.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:04.220
Oh, my God, I was just thinking about you.
- Thank you.

01:09:05.898 --> 01:09:10.022
Can't even look at the sky
without thinking about Dark Matter.

01:09:10.109 --> 01:09:12.484
Come in. Can I get you some tea?
- Yes.

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:13.862
Good.

01:09:25.125 --> 01:09:27.999
Come in. Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:37.214
it's so good to see you.
I thought you had disappeared completely.

01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:42.471
Bach?
- Yes. Yes.

01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:49.435
Do you have some good news?
- News?

01:09:50.944 --> 01:09:55.110
Yes. Oh, have you heard
from the other universities yet?

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.324
No.
- No? Oh, I- I'm sorry, I thought

01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:59.494
No.
- Mm.

01:10:07.171 --> 01:10:13.837
Oh, it's so good to see you.
What is Skin Sheen?

01:10:13.928 --> 01:10:14.969
Oh...

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.807
This some beauty product I sell.

01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:28.063
You sell?
- Just to kill time.

01:10:28.694 --> 01:10:35.943
And it's... it's pretty good stuff.
Do you like to try some?

01:10:36.036 --> 01:10:42.118
Oh, no, thank you. I have a lot of,
God knows, things that I have.

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:43.916
Sorry.

01:10:44.628 --> 01:10:46.835
But... No, I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

01:10:46.922 --> 01:10:49.921
Of course I'm always
looking for something new.

01:10:50.008 --> 01:10:53.340
You know, and just love to try it.
Love to.

01:10:53.805 --> 01:10:56.095
Sure?
- Sure.

01:10:58.434 --> 01:11:02.974
Oh, shoot.
- Uh-oh. Top came off.

01:11:03.064 --> 01:11:05.313
it's all right. It's all right.

01:11:12.364 --> 01:11:18.405
It's, it's just started.
- Yes, how did I know?

01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:26.665
It's quite a line of products.
What do they all do?

01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:29.380
Okay.

01:11:29.757 --> 01:11:34.840
Hand cream. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

01:11:35.475 --> 01:11:41.015
And, your hand, the first,

01:11:41.104 --> 01:11:44.769
you can put it here.
- Yeah. Mm.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.692
And then...

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:50.319
And the second...

01:11:52.659 --> 01:11:54.075
Oh.

01:11:54.159 --> 01:11:56.408
Second, you...

01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:04.624
Okay. You put it here, and then...

01:12:04.714 --> 01:12:09.255
I'm not, I'm not good at it.

01:12:10.802 --> 01:12:15.176
It's okay. This is good. It's nice.

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.684
It's nice.

01:12:19.312 --> 01:12:20.811
And...

01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:27.357
Mm?
- Yes. And...

01:12:29.366 --> 01:12:33.407
That's okay.
It really doesn't matter.

01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:36.953
Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.080
Yes. Good, good smile.
- Hmm, good smile.

01:12:46.841 --> 01:12:50.549
May I?
- Of course.

01:12:54.473 --> 01:12:56.181
This...

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:16.161
It's lovely.

01:13:27.802 --> 01:13:28.884
Liu Xing...

01:13:36.394 --> 01:13:38.477
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.108 --> 01:13:47.273
I sometimes have an
allergic reaction to these things.

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:55.574
It's just a temporary job.
- Yes, it's just for a little while.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:14:02.998
Then you'll find something wonderful.
I know you will.

01:14:08.428 --> 01:14:10.969
I know you will.

01:14:16.437 --> 01:14:23.270
Joanna, I have many,
many things must to do.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.067
Yes. I'm sure.
- I'm so busy.

01:14:28.158 --> 01:14:33.490
I'm so glad you came to see me though.
- l...

01:14:38.377 --> 01:14:42.126
I ... l...

01:14:47.095 --> 01:14:48.428
l...

01:14:49.598 --> 01:14:51.972
I must go to the library.

01:15:10.496 --> 01:15:15.120
Dad, Mom , how are you?

01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:20.415
Here is the money I saved in America,

01:15:20.507 --> 01:15:23.798
to repay you for all the gentle care
you have given me.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:52.771
Excuse me.

01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:03.180
Marvin Gelman believed

01:20:03.309 --> 01:20:07.975
that science could flourish only where
people were free to express their ideas.

01:20:08.064 --> 01:20:13.105
The winner of the Gelman Prize came to
America from Communist China 3 years ago,

01:20:13.195 --> 01:20:16.319
and has flourished at this university.

01:20:16.406 --> 01:20:19.821
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr Laurence Feng.

01:20:23.956 --> 01:20:28.455
By starting at 1 0 to the minus 36 seconds
after the Big Bang,

01:20:28.544 --> 01:20:32.751
I have derived new initial conditions
for the Reiser Model,

01:20:32.841 --> 01:20:38.757
that generate more accurate predictions of
the present-day structure of the universe.

01:20:38.846 --> 01:20:42.345
In broad terms, I am providing...

01:20:42.976 --> 01:20:44.350
What are you doing here?

01:21:56.429 --> 01:21:59.095
Liu Xing? What are you doing here?

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:09.023
Is Laurence finished?

01:22:11.571 --> 01:22:13.487
Are you all right?

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:21.849
Yes?
- Hello. My name is Joanna.
