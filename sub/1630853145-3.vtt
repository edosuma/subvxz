WEBVTT

00:23.823 --> 00:25.358
There you go.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.068
First floor,
right off the staircase.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.773
Has anyone seen my stapler?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.374
Okay. Uh,

00:41.441 --> 00:43.777
"State House Rules."
Where are we?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.578
Doing great.
We got a nice lineup.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.113
Did you get the mayor?

00:47.213 --> 00:48.948
Not yet, but we're
working on it.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.917
I want the mayor, Roger.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.953
Make it happen.
Make me happy.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.188
I'm Roland.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.191
That's what I --
Yes, alright.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.561
I think that's all,
friends and neighbors.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.030
Whoa! Whoa.
Uh, synaptic misfire.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.965
Almost forgot
the most important thing.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.601
Where are we with
"The French Chef"?

01:08.701 --> 01:09.869
It's been three days.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.071
Oh.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.906
Um...

01:12.972 --> 01:14.274
Right.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.076
Look, yeah.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.644
I know.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.711
What do you know?

01:18.778 --> 01:20.280
The show.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.149
She's not
a professional.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.284
Uh-huh.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.585
I mean, "A"
for effort, right?

01:25.652 --> 01:26.986
At least it didn't
cost us too much.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.989
I liked it.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.091
You did?

01:31.157 --> 01:32.125
I did.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.094
He liked it.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.962
She made the coq au vin --

01:36.062 --> 01:38.398
Is that
how you say it? It sounds dirty.

01:38.465 --> 01:39.833
But she hasn't been able
to stop talking

01:39.933 --> 01:41.835
about Julia Child
with her friends.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.504
Hunter --

01:44.604 --> 01:47.974
but that's our job,
to figure out what it is,

01:48.074 --> 01:49.609
and I'm intrigued.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.944
Go draw up the numbers

01:51.010 --> 01:53.246
and let's see
if this thing has legs.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.417
Uh, hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.253
I'm -- I'm confused.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.357
We all saw
the same pilot, right?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.826
You really want
to choose that

02:06.926 --> 02:10.196
over something like
"The Advocates"?

02:10.296 --> 02:13.299
I mean --

02:13.366 --> 02:15.368
Does this plot thicken?

02:15.468 --> 02:18.271
Hunter, Hunter,
with the fire and the move,

02:18.338 --> 02:22.542
do we really have the financial
flexibility to be wrong here?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.345
The funny thing
about being wrong, Russ,

02:25.445 --> 02:27.680
is that right up
until you realize it,

02:27.780 --> 02:30.350
it feels exactly the same
as being right.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.387
<i>I don't think you're going to</i>
<i>regret this, Mr. Fox.</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:36.723
I'll also say
that Tilly's cooking

02:36.823 --> 02:39.526
usually makes me sad
and fearful,

02:39.626 --> 02:42.562
but that meal was divine.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.898
I slept like a baby afterwards.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.500
There's wine
in the sauce, sir.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.736
Now, that's true, Rodney,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.704
but either way, I'm compelled.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.473
So off we go.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.657
These are the revised
weekend schedules.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.759
Wait.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.494
Don't go.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.111
Here.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.783
The numbers for your blessed
Croque Madame.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.952
Okay, well...

03:39.052 --> 03:40.453
maybe they don't
need to be this high.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.356
Really? Because we still need
to build a kitchen,

03:43.423 --> 03:45.625
and even if it's
the cheapest kitchen in Boston,

03:45.725 --> 03:47.927
that's still three-quarters
of our budget right there.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.295
Well, what if we were
able to take --

03:49.395 --> 03:52.432
And we can't pay Julia,
let alone support staff.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.868
Hell, with those numbers,
we can't even afford food.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.937
You are trying
to kill this.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.806
It's not tenable.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.541
I don't care
what Tilly wants.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.943
Hunter's a bottom-line guy, and
after you itemize these costs --

04:04.043 --> 04:05.478
Yes, but we are
looking for something

04:05.578 --> 04:07.814
that audiences want to watch.
You heard Hunter.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.549
People want to watch her.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.551
I'm sorry,

04:11.618 --> 04:14.787
but the numbers
are the numbers.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.756
I'll let Hunter know.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.658
Fine, but you're the one
telling her.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.159
She worked
incredibly hard, Russ.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.096
Call her in and give her
an explanation.

04:50.323 --> 04:54.460
Well, if they say "yes,"
the show could be for men, too.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.596
It's for anyone
who likes to cook.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.866
And eat, so, voilà.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.035
Medium rare for you, Paul.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.370
Hockey puck for Pop.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.471
Thank you, dear.

05:05.538 --> 05:09.509
But, uh, cooking on TV?

05:09.609 --> 05:10.977
Is that a thing
people do now?

05:11.044 --> 05:12.378
Oh, it is, Pop.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.213
It certainly is.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.449
John, may I offer you
some wine?

05:16.516 --> 05:17.550
Ah, no.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.552
Julia, bring me
another beer.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.953
We finished them with lunch.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.656
Try Paul's red.
It goes very well with the meat.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.563
What are they paying you
for this kind of thing?

05:30.663 --> 05:31.898
Well, I'm not sure yet.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.733
What's the business model
down there?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.703
Do they even have a business
model for public television?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.471
Well, that's
a good question.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.807
Who's talking upsides?

05:40.873 --> 05:43.142
Well, what<i> do</i> you know?

05:43.209 --> 05:44.377
John --

05:44.477 --> 05:46.079
All I know is that
they've called me in

05:46.179 --> 05:47.413
for a meeting
with the producers.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.982
Now, I'm hoping
that's a good sign.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.251
Pop, I'm being very clear-eyed
about this.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.687
<i>To be honest, I had my doubts</i>
<i>about the whole thing.</i>

05:54.754 --> 05:56.689
But then they saw
what you can do.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.425
<i>C'est pourquoi ils ont appelé</i>
<i>avec cette bonne nouvelle.</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:01.828
Oh, well,
I certainly hope so.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.062
Mmm.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.172
Mm.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.786
So she left Europe
to do a cooking show,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.955
but, uh, what about you?

06:29.055 --> 06:31.023
As we all know, John,
times change.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.292
New administration,
new rules.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.195
The foreign service became
a young man's game.

06:36.262 --> 06:37.296
Ah.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.632
So, uh, what<i> are</i>
you doing now?

06:41.367 --> 06:43.069
Painting, Dad.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.472
He's making art.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.640
Ah.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.809
Cambridge is a --
is a thriving town.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.479
I'm finding plenty of ways
to keep busy.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.081
Keep busy?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.617
Most grown men I know
keep busy by working.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.553
Well, we're certainly glad
<i>you're</i> still working, Pop.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.821
It took this business trip

07:01.921 --> 07:04.390
to finally get you
east of the Mississippi.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.625
Don't remind me.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.294
And can you admit
that you like the house?

07:08.394 --> 07:11.564
Oh, I do.
It's beautiful.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.133
A very solid house.
And good for the price.

07:14.233 --> 07:18.171
Yes, we were very grateful
for the help.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.506
I did notice, coming in,

07:20.606 --> 07:23.276
the gutters
on the south side,

07:23.342 --> 07:24.677
they could use
some tending to.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.346
Well, okey-dokey.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.749
Easy-peasy.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.852
Paul, I know
you're keeping busy,

07:32.952 --> 07:35.822
but would it be a violation
of your early retirement

07:35.922 --> 07:39.992
and your delicate hands to tend
to the needs of your house?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.665
Oh, you. Stop it.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.146
Sweetie, you okay?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.782
Julia, I --
I wasted a '55 Bordeaux

08:02.849 --> 08:04.817
on a man with no taste
or curiosity.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.719
Let's just go to bed.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.356
Well, you certainly
didn't waste it on me.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.124
And after drinking
that extra glass,

08:12.191 --> 08:14.227
I feel a little like
the farmer's daughter.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.364
Randy and amorous.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.534
I did not choose to retire.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.671
<i>He has no idea what happened</i>
<i>or how these things work.</i>

08:25.738 --> 08:29.075
<i>And then to have to relive</i>
<i>the humiliation all over again</i>

08:29.175 --> 08:30.877
through those questions.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.481
Delicate hands, Julia.
Really?

08:35.548 --> 08:38.684
I practice judo twice a week.
These hands are lethal weapons!

08:38.751 --> 08:40.319
Shh.

08:46.325 --> 08:47.994
You can't
take him seriously.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.597
He has a sour word
for everyone.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.933
I've finally come to terms
with civilian life,

08:54.033 --> 08:58.170
and -- and with what
this new phase means for us,

08:58.237 --> 09:00.773
and he comes in --

09:00.873 --> 09:02.575
Your father just knows

09:02.675 --> 09:05.711
how to make me feel very small
very fast.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.446
Well, it's his gift.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.250
He's just angry and --

09:11.350 --> 09:12.451
And old.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.421
Yes.
When did that happen?

09:15.521 --> 09:18.224
<i>It's almost like overnight,</i>
<i>he's turned into this old man</i>

09:18.291 --> 09:20.526
he never used to be.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.595
I'd love to be working.
You know that.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.230
No, no.

09:24.297 --> 09:28.034
Don't do that.
Don't undervalue what you do

09:28.100 --> 09:30.303
and what we have.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.904
If this meeting
goes well --

09:31.971 --> 09:33.306
Of course
it's going to go well.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.440
This isn't
the foreign service.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.975
They don't call you in
to fire you.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.445
<i>Nothing's a done deal yet,</i>
<i>but if it does go well,</i>

09:39.545 --> 09:40.980
we'll be making
this show together,

09:41.080 --> 09:44.917
<i>and I wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to do it without you, Paul.</i>

09:44.984 --> 09:48.888
And I am going to work you
to the bone.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.389
Mm.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.399
Giddy up.

10:00.466 --> 10:01.734
Mm.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.842
But it's just a numbers game,
and at the end of the day,

10:09.942 --> 10:13.412
the station can't afford it.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.248
Oh, shit.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.318
Yeah. We're sad.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.320
Is this
because of the pilot?

10:21.420 --> 10:23.356
I know things
got a bit lawless.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.490
No, Julia, not at all.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.192
Making television
is chaotic.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.861
We are all used to that.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.864
And you should know that Hunter
is a big advocate of the show.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.532
This decision is purely
a financial one.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.802
Mm-hmm. We tried to wrestle
the numbers into submission,

10:36.869 --> 10:40.673
but the -- the cold, hard truth
is that they don't add up.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.776
The costs are
too considerable.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.945
Yeah.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.781
How considerable?

10:48.848 --> 10:50.950
Uh, I mean...

10:51.017 --> 10:52.618
Well, I could build you a set,

10:52.685 --> 10:56.489
but then we'd have to worry
about covering food, and labor,

10:56.555 --> 10:58.357
and --

10:58.457 --> 11:01.293
and it's a lot.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.729
Mucho. Hmm?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.064
Well, what's a lot?

11:05.164 --> 11:07.166
Yeah.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.143
I can do that.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.744
Excuse me?

11:18.844 --> 11:22.081
I'll cover those costs.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.716
Look, I-I know
you're disappointed --

11:23.816 --> 11:25.918
Oh, no, no.
No, I'm not disappointed.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.688
This is actually exciting.

11:28.754 --> 11:32.324
If money is our only concern,
I won't let it stand in our way.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.492
Now -- Now, look --

11:33.559 --> 11:36.095
Julia, this is wonderful.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.430
But you're -- you're sure?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.498
Hmm?

11:39.565 --> 11:41.500
Yes!

11:41.567 --> 11:43.769
Let's do it.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.205
And then
she fell down the stairs,

11:46.272 --> 11:48.107
skinned both knees...

11:48.207 --> 11:50.109
...and landed right at the feet
of Father Wilson

11:50.209 --> 11:51.577
with her skirt
over her head.

11:51.677 --> 11:52.912
Yes, alright, Pop.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.715
So yes,
class clown indeed.

11:55.781 --> 12:00.186
But always everyone's
favorite wingman.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.254
Well, wingman no more.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.857
Love, this time,
you're the pilot.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.459
Of her pilot.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.430
Uh, let me
ask you something.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.966
<i>You're a reasonable,</i>
<i>reasonably attractive woman</i>

12:14.066 --> 12:16.268
of a certain age.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.771
Would you be prancing around
a kitchen set?

12:18.871 --> 12:20.473
On a television?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.142
<i>No, no, I'm -- I'm proud of you.</i>
<i>It's just that I think --</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:25.044
Julia is
a natural performer.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.279
If I had half her charm,
I could rule the world.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.048
And speaking of charm,

12:29.115 --> 12:31.784
who wants to make a toast?
Not you, John.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.721
Oh, Paul, no.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.723
And caviar is on the way.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.792
It's just too extravagant,
honey.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.260
Nonsense.
We're celebrating.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.561
We certainly are.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.730
And I would just
like to say,

12:44.797 --> 12:49.068
I have had many,
many doubts along the way.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.604
But I was wrong
about the cookbook,

12:51.670 --> 12:52.838
and I hope that I'm wrong

12:52.938 --> 12:55.508
about this television program,
as well.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.479
Darling?

13:00.579 --> 13:02.181
Excuse me for a moment.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.592
Oh.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.694
Sweetie.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.200
Your father's got
some very sharp claws.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.002
<i>Oh, please, he's been</i>
<i>giving those toasts</i>

13:23.102 --> 13:25.204
since I was in the crib.
I don't care about that.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.373
<i>What bothers me is that Paul</i>
<i>went full high gussy</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:30.009
and ordered
a $100 bottle of champagne.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.178
We're celebrating.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.380
<i>Does he think we're</i>
<i>the damn Vanderbilts?</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:36.115
Julia!

13:38.284 --> 13:39.718
I said yes.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.321
<i>I said yes, Avis, and</i>
<i>I don't know what I was thinking</i>

13:42.388 --> 13:43.889
or how I'm going to
pull this off,

13:43.989 --> 13:46.025
<i>and I barely looked</i>
<i>at the numbers, and I agreed,</i>

13:46.125 --> 13:48.294
<i>and I said to my father</i>
<i>I wouldn't say yes to anything</i>

13:48.360 --> 13:50.396
without knowing what's entailed,
but he's right!

13:50.496 --> 13:52.698
I'm an irresponsible clown
who doesn't think ahead --

13:52.798 --> 13:54.633
Slow down. Slow down.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.702
What are you
talking about?

13:56.802 --> 13:58.137
Well, WGBH
picked up the show,

13:58.204 --> 13:59.672
but they can't afford
to produce it,

13:59.738 --> 14:01.507
<i>so if I want it made,</i>
<i>I have to figure out a way</i>

14:01.574 --> 14:02.741
to cover food and labor,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.410
and then I have to do it
for 26 episodes.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.146
<i>And I have some of my own money,</i>
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

14:07.213 --> 14:09.548
and if I tell Paul
what's going on, he'll just...

14:09.648 --> 14:11.083
think I'm crazy,
and I<i> am</i> crazy.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.418
If they want the show,
they should pay,

14:12.518 --> 14:13.586
but the problem is --

14:13.686 --> 14:17.356
Yes, I know
what the problem is.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.592
I want to do it.

14:19.692 --> 14:24.330
I don't care if it<i> is</i> nuts
or a terrible business decision.

14:24.396 --> 14:29.602
And I supposed I don't even care
that I'd be lying to my husband.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.439
I want it
more than anything, Avis.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.507
Alright then.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.909
Let's do it.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.845
I'm early. I know.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.714
I was just too excited.
I couldn't stay home.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.783
No, come in.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.785
I thought I'd be seeing
that little bunny.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.621
She's in the living room,
napping in her carriage,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.122
and I hope
she never wakes up.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.590
Ha!

14:51.690 --> 14:55.628
Today. I hope
she never wakes up today.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.396
My kingdom for a nanny.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.931
This is Norman's
second time around,

14:59.031 --> 15:00.299
so the baby's my project.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.967
Don't let a middle-aged man
impregnate you.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.068
There are strings.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.303
Well, we're very happy
you're here,

15:04.403 --> 15:05.804
and it's wonderful
of you to help.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.374
<i>You're</i> happy?
When Avis called and said

15:08.440 --> 15:11.210
<i>that you were holding</i>
<i>cooking classes for extra cash,</i>

15:11.277 --> 15:12.645
I just about
hit the ceiling.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.747
<i>These women are gonna</i>
<i>fall sideways for this,</i>

15:14.813 --> 15:16.148
Julia, really.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.752
<i>Oh, hello. I didn't realize</i>
<i>we were entertaining.</i>

15:19.818 --> 15:21.253
I thought I mentioned it.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.155
Uh, you certainly didn't.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.491
And, uh, I hate
to be rude, ladies --

15:25.591 --> 15:27.059
You? Rude?

15:27.126 --> 15:31.230
<i>But I'll -- I'll need you</i>
<i>to vacate for a little while.</i>

15:31.297 --> 15:33.732
I-I thought you were going
to WGBH today.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.801
<i>That's tomorrow. First, I need</i>
<i>to take measurements</i>

15:35.901 --> 15:37.336
to pass along
to the set builders.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.571
We can't have that kitchen
we had last time.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.274
Oh, right, of course.
It's just --

15:42.341 --> 15:45.978
Well, I have some women
coming over for a cooking class.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.580
A cooking class?
Why on God's green Earth

15:48.647 --> 15:50.316
would you be teaching now?

15:50.416 --> 15:52.851
We need to be focused
on the show.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.855
Dad!
There are ladies present.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.959
<i>Well, good. Can one of them</i>
<i>make me a cup of coffee?</i>

16:00.025 --> 16:01.327
Do you really have time
for this?

16:01.427 --> 16:03.696
<i>This -- This doesn't</i>
<i>make much sense to me.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:04.863
Darling --

16:04.964 --> 16:07.199
Paul, the classes
are for publicity.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.468
These women will be her base,
and the audience

16:09.535 --> 16:12.137
is the most important ingredient
in a cooking show.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.206
Oh, see what I did?
Ingredient.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.141
I get it.
Keep your day job, Avis.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.876
You'll have to do this
another time.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.144
Uh --

16:19.211 --> 16:22.348
and there is
a lot to prep.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.950
Many a chocolate mousse
will be mixed on that stove,

16:25.017 --> 16:27.453
and do you know what "desserts"
spelled backwards is?

16:27.519 --> 16:28.654
"Stressed."

16:28.721 --> 16:31.724
And we don't want that
for Julia, do we?

16:35.461 --> 16:37.563
A lot of technique
and a little bit of magic

16:37.663 --> 16:38.831
go a long way.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.566
I simply loved
teaching in Paris,

16:40.666 --> 16:42.901
so I can't tell you
how excited I am

16:43.002 --> 16:45.070
to share the wonders
of la cuisine --

16:45.170 --> 16:47.806
Oh! I'm sorry,
my dear. I was --

16:50.843 --> 16:55.214
To share the wonders of la
cuisine française here at home.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.682
Would you mind
for a moment?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.884
If you'd just take that.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.887
Just go right to
the edge of the stove.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.756
Yeah. Perfect.

17:03.856 --> 17:09.328
So, let's roll up our sleeves
and marshal our wits

17:09.395 --> 17:10.696
and dive in.

17:10.763 --> 17:13.599
Oh, very good.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.605
Now we want to add
more butter.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.107
And remember, we want it cold.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.209
Don't be shy.
There's more in the fridge.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.577
One second.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.417
Oh. Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.452
No, I --

17:33.552 --> 17:35.387
Okay.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.290
And a little sprinkle
of flour.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.927
Just use your paring knife

17:42.027 --> 17:45.030
to cut along the outer edge

17:45.097 --> 17:46.965
of the shrimp's back.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.134
Just...

17:52.137 --> 17:53.272
Oh.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.441
Golly.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.643
That's perfect.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.379
Now...

18:15.594 --> 18:16.995
I'm a Tiger, too.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.766
Oh, I bet you are.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.835
Pop?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.583
Well, that was fun!

18:41.653 --> 18:43.522
Delicious.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.757
- Oh, cheers.
- Cheers.

18:45.824 --> 18:47.759
- Cheers.
- Yes.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.499
This is the mock-up
I'm giving to Russ.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.869
Oh, that's lovely,
sweetheart.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.940
<i>Don't you have to write</i>
<i>your outline for Russ tonight?</i>

19:02.007 --> 19:06.512
<i>I just don't understand</i>
<i>why you're doing all this.</i>

19:06.612 --> 19:08.981
We need to get him
out of her hair.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.683
He nodded off.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.886
I have to get her home,
but tell Julia

19:13.986 --> 19:16.188
it was so nice
having something to do again.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.056
I will.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.458
my brain has been pudding.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.860
But after today,
as crazy as it was,

19:21.960 --> 19:24.363
<i>I might go home tonight</i>
<i>and work on my dissertation.</i>

19:24.463 --> 19:26.064
Well, look at that.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.233
Mwah.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.902
Ah.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.504
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.339
That was just like
arts and crafts.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.741
Oh.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.343
Thank you.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.812
Do you think
shrimp is an aphrodisiac?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.351
Mrs. Child?

19:46.418 --> 19:47.753
Oh, it's Julia,
dear, please.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.656
Oh, uh, Julia.
Um, my name is Babe,

19:50.722 --> 19:54.026
and, uh,
I just wanted to say, um,

19:54.092 --> 19:56.728
my mother died
earlier this year,

19:56.828 --> 19:59.932
and, um,
I've been very low.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.602
My husband hasn't known
how to, uh --

20:03.702 --> 20:05.437
Well, it's been hard.

20:05.537 --> 20:10.042
But today was the first day
that I felt like my old self,

20:10.108 --> 20:12.511
so thank you.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.447
Oh, no, Babe.
Thank you.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.849
That means so much to me.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.587
Yeah. Well,
I can't wait to tell my friends

20:21.687 --> 20:23.755
and watch the show.

20:26.692 --> 20:27.759
Thank you.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.962
Thank you.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.397
Have a good one.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.705
Well, we got through that.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.740
We did.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.108
I'll stay and clean.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.476
Oh, no, no, no.
You -- You go.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.811
You've done
more than enough.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.980
And take a bottle of wine
with you.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.983
I'll just
straighten up here

20:51.083 --> 20:53.819
and get started
on the next episode.

20:53.919 --> 20:58.757
Well, we made just enough,
if it's any consolation.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.759
Was just enough, huh?

21:00.826 --> 21:03.295
To the penny.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.998
Then I'll need to do this
every week.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.966
It looks that way.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.935
Oh, alright, then.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.570
At least
we made Babe laugh.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.338
There's that.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.073
Yeah.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.980
Who's Babe?

21:27.286 --> 21:30.989
And then what's really
nice is that in Episode 6 --

21:31.089 --> 21:33.358
This is all
you have for me?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.526
Is that not enough?

21:34.626 --> 21:35.961
No, it's not enough.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.196
You only submitted 12 recipes.
We need 26.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.365
We're doing 26 episodes,
remember?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.668
Okay, 26. Got it.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.102
And they need
to be organized.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.938
<i>I don't want a babble of recipes</i>
<i>with no methodology.</i>

21:47.005 --> 21:49.207
Russ?
These counters won't work.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.009
They're too low
for Julia's height.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.312
I gave specific
measurements.

21:53.378 --> 21:56.214
Talk to the guys
with the hammers.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.549
This is the schedule.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.217
This is what we have to do
every week.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.687
Script three days
in advance on Mondays.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.155
Run-through on Tuesday.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.691
<i>Food shopping and tech</i>
<i>rehearsals on Wednesdays.</i>

22:05.791 --> 22:06.892
We shoot Thursday.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.393
Editing begins on Fridays.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.895
Oh, my. Okay.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.898
<i>And you will need to think about</i>
<i>how the season is structured.</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:16.234
Structured? Like --

22:16.335 --> 22:18.403
Like which recipes
come when.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.971
Oh, structured.
Yes, of course.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.473
I know what that is.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.909
The -- The spacing isn't right
for the dishwasher.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.012
That all has to shift over!

22:30.015 --> 22:33.652
Our knowledge of television
is only two months old.

22:33.719 --> 22:37.923
Between you and me,
we just got our first TV.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.759
We're lucky
to have you, Russ.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.196
Yeah. Well...
we'll see.

22:44.262 --> 22:46.098
And uh, Russ, I think
we'll need another foot

22:46.198 --> 22:47.566
between the island
and the sink.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.901
Like, I said, talk to
those guys over there.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.237
<i>I've got to get to the set</i>
<i>of "I've Been Reading."</i>

22:52.337 --> 22:53.572
Just wonderful.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.707
Alright, you "guys over there,"
come here.

22:55.774 --> 22:56.908
Come here. Come here.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.443
Just -- These dimensions
are all wrong.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.846
Just follow my lead.
Someone put a thumb right there.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.247
Right there.

23:04.349 --> 23:07.119
So, satisfy
your inner scoundrel

23:07.219 --> 23:10.956
and hie thee to the nearest
bookseller to purchase

23:11.056 --> 23:16.428
The Art
of the Shakespearean Insult."

23:16.528 --> 23:18.797
Clarence, thank you so much
for joining us.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.399
Thank you
for having me, Albert.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.235
Until next week,
dear friends and readers,

23:23.301 --> 23:25.971
I am your host,
Professor Albert Duhamel.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.107
<i>Audentes fortuna iuvat.</i>

23:29.207 --> 23:31.476
And we're out.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.546
Um, sorry, folks.
Don't mean to interrupt.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.049
Albert, looking good up there.
Where's Morash?

23:38.116 --> 23:40.218
I went over to "The French Chef"
to find you.

23:40.285 --> 23:41.987
Love the set, by the way.
It'll be beautiful.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.588
Well, I have to be here
for tapings.

23:43.655 --> 23:46.491
Oh, no. No.
No, no, no, you don't.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.827
I want to get Julia moving.
I don't need you here.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.662
This show can run itself.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.164
What did you just say?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.599
It's a figure of speech,
Albert.

23:54.666 --> 23:57.836
But I'm confident
the legs over here are strong.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.638
Well, you can't take Russ.

23:59.738 --> 24:01.573
I'm sorry to spring this
on everyone,

24:01.640 --> 24:03.341
but this is where we are.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.843
Russ, you're with Julia.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.914
Albert, uh, you'll get Richard
as your new producer.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.249
Well, who in holy Christmas
is Richard?

24:15.954 --> 24:18.089
He can't be my producer.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.525
<i>He's right. I can't.</i>

24:20.625 --> 24:21.660
<i>I don't read.</i>

24:21.760 --> 24:24.463
Alright, uh, well --

24:26.131 --> 24:27.432
Alice?

24:27.499 --> 24:29.868
Do you read?

24:29.968 --> 24:33.705
W-Wonderful. Uh, you can stay
and assist these fine gentlemen.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.507
Hunter, we should
talk more about this.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.542
Mm, my circus, my clowns.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.311
Thanks for being
accommodating, folks.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.613
Can't wait to see
what we come up with.

24:46.017 --> 24:49.521
I will not be upstaged
by a quiche.

24:49.621 --> 24:52.290
Uh, well, we won't
let that happen, Albert.

24:54.659 --> 24:58.029
You think you have what it takes
to be my producer?

24:58.129 --> 24:59.397
I will certainly try.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.732
Splendid.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.234
Get me Nabokov.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.736
<i> Yeah, Alice.</i>

25:04.836 --> 25:06.805
<i>Get him Nabokov.</i>

25:10.542 --> 25:12.410
<i>Who's Nabokov?</i>

25:18.183 --> 25:20.585
Sweetie.
Sweetie, don't be scared.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.487
It's me. I'm using my key.

25:22.554 --> 25:23.822
Mom, what are you
doing here?

25:23.889 --> 25:25.824
That key is
for emergencies only.

25:25.891 --> 25:28.093
Now, I know you told me
you were busy tonight.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.761
But there was a sale
at Filene's --

25:29.861 --> 25:31.096
That's an emergency --

25:31.196 --> 25:33.031
And I couldn't not
pick you up some bras,

25:33.098 --> 25:34.900
because that one I saw
underneath your blouse

25:35.000 --> 25:36.601
last week was so dingy.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.037
<i>And I can't have my child</i>
<i>in the streets looking raggedy.</i>

25:39.104 --> 25:41.273
And I also brought you
some leftovers.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.943
And on my way here,
I ran into Henry Jones.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.945
Hmm.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.114
<i>But did you know he sweats</i>
<i>out the top of his head</i>

25:49.214 --> 25:50.282
when he eats spicy food?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.517
I don't need dinner.
I cooked.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.252
Excuse me.

25:54.352 --> 25:57.756
These hands made that quiche
from scratch.

25:57.856 --> 26:01.459
Oh, someone thinks
she's doing something!

26:01.560 --> 26:04.729
<i>Can you make another one for the</i>
<i>church's toy drive on Sunday?</i>

26:04.796 --> 26:07.098
I can't Sunday. I have to work.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.466
When Philip is at the office
all night,

26:08.567 --> 26:09.935
you don't give him
a hard time.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.803
When Fred and Sam are busy,
you don't say boo to them.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.071
That's because
they're married.

26:13.138 --> 26:14.306
I don't have to worry
about them.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.640
You don't have to worry
about me.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.642
Oh, yes, I do.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.444
Have you been dating?

26:19.544 --> 26:21.546
I've been reading.

26:21.613 --> 26:24.883
Well, being up to your eyebrows
in Norman Mailer

26:24.950 --> 26:26.451
is no way
to spend your youth.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.053
Okay.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.487
No, it's not.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.956
and available
for opportunities.

26:31.056 --> 26:33.992
The Lord can't find
a parked car.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.794
What does that even mean?

26:35.894 --> 26:36.995
Excuse me. Steer.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.464
I meant the Lord can't steer
a parked car.

26:39.564 --> 26:40.932
You have to have
a full tank of gas

26:40.999 --> 26:43.935
and be in drive,
ready for action.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.237
Join Dottie's bowling team
with me.

26:46.304 --> 26:48.907
Mom, I am trying to work on
some important things right now,

26:48.974 --> 26:50.342
and it doesn't make me feel good
when you say

26:50.442 --> 26:52.410
that my life is meaningless
just because I'm single.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.679
Ah, ah, uh, okay.
Okay.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.016
Oh, uh, come on.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.518
Honey.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.253
I just...

27:02.320 --> 27:04.789
want you happy, tootsie.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.191
Is there anything
Daddy and I can do

27:06.291 --> 27:08.526
to help
with the workload?

27:08.627 --> 27:11.696
That depends. Do either of you
know Philip Roth?

27:11.796 --> 27:15.300
No. But I do know Harold Roth
from the pharmacy,

27:15.367 --> 27:17.302
and his son
just got back from Brown,

27:17.369 --> 27:20.672
and Harold said he'd love
to make an introduction.

27:21.673 --> 27:22.874
Unbelievable.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.143
Oh, come on.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.881
Sauté the bacon in oil.

27:32.984 --> 27:36.788
Dry the beef
in paper towels.

27:36.855 --> 27:37.989
Sweetheart.

27:38.056 --> 27:42.494
Oh, I'm sorry.
My head's a scrambled egg.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.363
Russ is -- He's a tough teacher,
I'm realizing.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.065
Mm.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.035
Um, you know how we say,

27:50.135 --> 27:51.169
"He who loves the rose

27:51.236 --> 27:53.905
must respect the thorn"?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.241
I think I have
the best possible news

27:56.341 --> 27:58.510
at the worst possible time.

27:58.576 --> 28:01.146
I got a call from, uh, Antoine?
You know him?

28:01.212 --> 28:04.149
<i>His -- His gallery's underneath</i>
<i>my -- my judo dojo?</i>

28:04.215 --> 28:05.517
Yes, okay.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.420
Well, it looks like
one of his artists

28:08.520 --> 28:10.321
fell through
for an upcoming show.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.523
Oh, Paul.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.024
And he wondered

28:13.091 --> 28:17.262
if I might want
to have a showing of my work.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.697
Oh, my goodness!

28:18.763 --> 28:20.665
I know.
It's -- It's terrible timing

28:20.732 --> 28:22.200
with your show
getting started,

28:22.267 --> 28:24.769
<i>and I worry I-I'd be leaving</i>
<i>when you're underwater</i>

28:24.869 --> 28:27.505
with all this work and -- and
your silly cooking classes --

28:27.572 --> 28:29.207
Oh, don't be a lunatic.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.609
This is wonderful news.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.546
Are you sure?

28:34.612 --> 28:36.014
I -- If I did do it,
I promise

28:36.081 --> 28:38.883
<i>I-I wouldn't take my eye</i>
<i>off the ball with you.</i>

28:38.950 --> 28:43.054
Paul, your art must be
your priority now.

28:44.255 --> 28:45.123
Okay.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.125
You can call that Antoine

28:47.225 --> 28:48.960
and tell him<i> oui.</i>

28:49.060 --> 28:51.629
A thousand times<i> oui.</i>

28:52.731 --> 28:53.865
Okay.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.144
Oh.
Oh, Pop, I'm sorry.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.047
Did I wake you?

29:09.114 --> 29:12.083
I haven't been sleeping
so well lately.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.152
"A difference
between..."

29:20.291 --> 29:23.061
"In your mouth."

29:25.764 --> 29:29.067
"Of the oven."

29:32.771 --> 29:34.339
Mm.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.644
Here's to those
who wish us well.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.514
And those who don't
can go to hell.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.922
Ahh.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.697
So this is the TV show?

29:59.798 --> 30:02.333
Yeah, hopefully.

30:02.433 --> 30:05.136
Making a single episode
is one thing,

30:05.203 --> 30:07.105
but an entire season?

30:09.808 --> 30:12.210
I feel like I don't know
what the heck I'm doing.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.047
Well, never mind with all
that head-clutching nonsense.

30:16.147 --> 30:19.217
You put one foot
in front of the other.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.154
How did you grandfather open
his first bank in Illinois?

30:23.221 --> 30:25.557
Brick by brick.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.060
And how did I build
the ranch house in Montecito?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.862
Board by board.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.466
Alright, then.
There you go.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.504
Cup by cup, Julia.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.408
Hm.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.486
What the hell
is that word?

30:55.553 --> 30:57.255
Boeuf.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.891
It means beef.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.926
Well, why don't
they just say that?

31:11.002 --> 31:12.937
But then first
<i>I found myself wondering,</i>

31:13.037 --> 31:15.440
should we prepare
the bacon ahead of time?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.208
Or since we have the sink,

31:17.275 --> 31:20.845
<i>should I simmer the rind</i>
<i>and bacon on-camera?</i>

31:20.912 --> 31:23.381
Oh! Heavens.

31:23.448 --> 31:24.616
It works.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.884
Indeed, it does.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.952
So many details.

31:28.052 --> 31:33.024
It's marvelous how
the pieces come together.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.059
Makes me so excited
for what we can do,

31:35.126 --> 31:39.898
<i>and I can't wait to share my</i>
<i>little tricks and trade secrets.</i>

31:39.964 --> 31:42.133
And I was thinking,
I can show Americans

31:42.233 --> 31:45.069
<i>how to clean mushrooms,</i>
<i>which they don't know how to do.</i>

31:45.136 --> 31:46.804
And that would be good
in Episode 13,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.874
when we do veal scallops
in mushroom sauce.

31:49.941 --> 31:53.111
And this episode,
oh, Russ, you --

31:55.413 --> 31:56.648
Russ?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.616
Yeah?
What is it?

31:58.716 --> 32:02.553
<i>I was just wondering</i>
<i>if you liked that idea.</i>

32:02.620 --> 32:06.824
<i>Of me removing the bacon rind</i>
<i>before boiling the water?</i>

32:11.262 --> 32:12.563
Uh-huh.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.570
I-I haven't heard
from anyone yet.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.806
I thought
you were my producer.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.508
I am, Albert,
and I can call people,

32:23.608 --> 32:25.410
but I can't make them
call me back.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.811
And it might be
a little difficult

32:26.911 --> 32:28.446
to secure an interview
with Nabokov

32:28.513 --> 32:31.182
now that he's moved
to Switzerland.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.851
Have you seen Julia's set?

32:33.952 --> 32:37.121
With that sink?

32:37.188 --> 32:39.857
I could get you
some more f-ferns.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.962
<i>She gets running water,</i>
<i>and I'm stuck with Roland!</i>

32:44.028 --> 32:46.864
There's nothing
behind the eyes.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.766
Well, you still have me.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.855
Unbelievable.

33:29.974 --> 33:32.577
Bobby Odell's
directing a play.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.911
Oh, gosh.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.749
Yeah.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.850
What's the play?

33:38.916 --> 33:41.252
It doesn't matter.
He's a hack.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.188
Bobby was, what,
three years below me at B.U.?

33:44.255 --> 33:46.157
And now he's doing
all this work?

33:46.224 --> 33:47.425
It's a sign.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.093
It has to be.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.996
I need to quit my job.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.865
Oh. I see.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.767
Because here's the thing,
honey --

33:55.867 --> 33:57.502
I'm dying at the station.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.771
I can't get anything I want
off the ground.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.073
And I know being an artist,
truly pursuing it,

34:02.173 --> 34:03.441
is a sacrifice,

34:03.541 --> 34:05.743
<i>but this is the time</i>
<i>to give directing a real shot,</i>

34:05.843 --> 34:07.879
because otherwise, Julia?

34:07.945 --> 34:09.680
This can't be my life.

34:09.747 --> 34:11.449
I need more.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.751
Good.
I-I have more for you.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.189
I'm pregnant.

34:18.256 --> 34:21.793
Dr. Jenkins called
this afternoon.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.262
I know that work is hard,
but, I don't know,

34:24.362 --> 34:26.364
maybe it'll be easier when
you have a little bundle of joy

34:26.431 --> 34:29.133
to come home to, crying
and screaming and pooping

34:29.233 --> 34:30.768
and keeping you up
all night.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.206
We're having a baby?

34:35.273 --> 34:37.542
Yeah. We are.

34:37.608 --> 34:40.545
So can you hang in there?

34:41.779 --> 34:44.982
And, I don't know,
maybe give me a hug?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.217
Come here. Come here.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.252
Of course. Come here.
Come here.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.321
Come here. Of course.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.124
Of course.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.097
Mm!

34:59.163 --> 35:01.899
Well, you're going to heaven.

35:01.966 --> 35:03.334
When my father
stayed with us,

35:03.434 --> 35:05.603
I went right out
of my fucking mind.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.338
Oh, Dad likes you.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.273
Wanted you to come to lunch
with us today.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.177
I was grocery shopping
with Dorothy.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.346
You're all set with
boeuf bourguignon for this week

35:15.446 --> 35:16.681
and for class on Sunday.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.850
Oh, great.

35:18.950 --> 35:19.951
Your troops are on it.

35:20.017 --> 35:21.986
Yes, well,
your general is not.

35:22.086 --> 35:24.689
Oh, Avis, I don't know
if I can do all this.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.790
You can.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.859
Your next script's not due
until Monday.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.260
When do I write it?

35:29.327 --> 35:30.795
Saturday.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.363
Well, when do I sleep?

35:32.463 --> 35:33.865
Oh. Well,

35:33.965 --> 35:37.768
at least you don't have Paul
underfoot this weekend.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.171
How are he and Antoine
getting along?

35:42.640 --> 35:45.042
Oh, Avis DeVoto!

35:46.677 --> 35:48.546
Antoine Lawrence
is a very old friend

35:48.646 --> 35:51.149
with very good taste
who owes me a favor.

35:51.215 --> 35:54.952
Oh, my goodness.
I'm a terrible person.

35:55.019 --> 35:57.655
First lying to my husband
about my show

35:57.722 --> 35:59.957
and then lying to him again
about<i> his</i> show.

36:00.024 --> 36:01.159
Oh --

36:01.225 --> 36:03.528
Don't pick that up.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.397
And don't
beat yourself up.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.332
Antoine loved Paul's work.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.067
He was happy
to give him a chance.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.171
You see, I want
to do all this, I do,

36:13.237 --> 36:15.840
but I may be at the end
of my rope.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.543
And the teaching
is just too much.

36:18.643 --> 36:21.245
<i>And there's a limit to what</i>
<i>I can ask of you and Dorothy.</i>

36:21.345 --> 36:22.380
We're happy to do it.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.081
But Dorothy needs
a babysitter.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.751
I feel like
I'm taking advantage.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.587
And Antoine, good taste
notwithstanding,

36:29.687 --> 36:31.088
I'm still lying
to my husband.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.425
Whether you tell Paul or not,
you still need the money,

36:34.525 --> 36:38.930
and he's far too proud to let
you foot the bill yourself.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.932
So in this case, my dear,

36:41.032 --> 36:44.602
the truth will not
set you free.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.170
Are you sure?

36:46.237 --> 36:51.042
My advice is, stop this
yakky yak and enjoy the ride.

36:51.108 --> 36:54.445
And finish what's left
of your butter pecan.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.581
Leave it to you to find
the one ice cream

36:56.681 --> 36:59.350
actually made with butter.

36:59.417 --> 37:02.253
And you're the one
eating rocky road,

37:02.353 --> 37:05.022
which may be prescient.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.397
Paulski,

37:13.464 --> 37:15.600
can I borrow your brain
for just a moment

37:15.700 --> 37:17.301
and ask for help?

37:17.401 --> 37:18.970
What do you think
of these edits?

37:19.070 --> 37:22.073
<i>I need to get the changes</i>
<i>to Russ for the tech rehearsal.</i>

37:22.139 --> 37:26.244
Well, I'm all yours
if you'll help me figure out

37:26.310 --> 37:27.745
how to arrange these pieces.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.647
I'm trying to tell a story,

37:29.747 --> 37:32.450
but I don't think
I've cracked it yet.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.151
Oh.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.987
Right-o.

38:02.847 --> 38:03.948
Running water.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.182
What the fuck?

38:06.517 --> 38:08.185
That's exactly
what I said.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.488
You two.

38:10.588 --> 38:13.357
Ladies.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.860
Sergeant Morash.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.862
Alright, alright, alright.
Let's get started.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.333
First positions for rehearsal!

38:22.433 --> 38:25.269
Let's get ready
to, uh, get ready.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.439
Okay, Julia, let's start
with the pot on the burner

38:28.506 --> 38:31.208
and take it off the heat,
remove the lid, give a taste,

38:31.309 --> 38:33.511
and then put it
in the top oven.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.680
Jim, can you bring
your camera in here?

38:35.780 --> 38:38.482
Avis and Dorothy, why don't we
keep you behind the counter

38:38.549 --> 38:40.718
until she goes to the oven?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.853
Julia.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.488
I like those recipes
you submitted.

38:44.555 --> 38:46.657
Oh, good.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.959
Instead of structuring
the season like a meal,

38:49.026 --> 38:51.362
appetizers followed
by entrees then desserts,

38:51.462 --> 38:52.730
let's toggle
between courses

38:52.830 --> 38:54.865
so we don't have
five soup episodes in a row.

38:54.965 --> 38:58.536
Oh, that's stupendous
thinking, Russ.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.638
Avis, you have
those onions?

39:00.705 --> 39:04.075
Yes.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.843
Peeled and unpeeled

39:05.910 --> 39:08.646
and...

39:08.713 --> 39:10.047
cooked.

39:10.147 --> 39:13.684
Now, Julia, I need you here
but looking into camera 2

39:13.751 --> 39:15.419
as you cut through
the slices of beef.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.189
And, Avis, you can trick out
the cooked onions

39:18.255 --> 39:19.924
as the camera's
tight on Julia.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.059
Like magic.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.395
So, I-I was thinking --

39:25.896 --> 39:27.264
What is it?

39:28.666 --> 39:31.102
Which camera is which?

39:31.202 --> 39:34.038
<i>That was the problem I had</i>
<i>during the damned pilot.</i>

39:34.105 --> 39:35.406
Yes, it was,

39:35.506 --> 39:40.211
so let's make this
a little more clear for you.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.282
I stole these from the set
of "Karate Kats."

39:45.383 --> 39:47.952
Maybe they'll help?

39:48.052 --> 39:50.788
Friends!
Little friends to talk to.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.890
This is Binky.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.526
He'll be your friend until
you go for that cutting board.

39:55.593 --> 39:58.295
After that, you'll be
with Boochie.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.930
Boochie.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.732
until you start
on the mushrooms.

40:01.799 --> 40:04.802
Oh, Russ, I have
so much to learn.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.037
Yes, you do.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.906
But that's what rehearsal's for.

40:08.973 --> 40:12.410
<i>Oh, holy Moses,</i>
<i>I'm going to get this.</i>

40:12.476 --> 40:14.645
Alright, folks, let's take it
from the top

40:14.745 --> 40:17.047
and give it a go with food.

40:17.114 --> 40:19.750
No, I -- Before --
Before we begin,

40:19.817 --> 40:23.454
I just want to thank you all
for taking this ride with me.

40:23.554 --> 40:27.258
To have this opportunity
at my age is --

40:27.324 --> 40:28.959
Everyone's working so hard.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.662
I can't believe how lucky I am.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.432
I'm going to swing for the
fences on every single show,

40:34.498 --> 40:37.234
and regardless of what happens,

40:37.301 --> 40:39.837
at least there will always
be leftovers.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.172
Yeah.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.913
Alice! My fern!

41:07.031 --> 41:08.766
May I?

41:08.833 --> 41:10.501
Please.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.978
Ah.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.114
So that's how you paint
a pomegranate.

41:24.181 --> 41:27.151
How much would someone pay
for something like that?

41:27.218 --> 41:29.353
Well, I tend to

41:29.453 --> 41:31.689
leave the business concerns
to other people.

41:31.789 --> 41:32.990
Ah.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.358
The art and the expression,

41:34.458 --> 41:36.994
they're the --
They're what get my attention.

41:37.061 --> 41:40.664
I got to tell you, Paul, words
like "art" and "expression"

41:40.731 --> 41:44.068
send me
right to the crapper.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.470
It's funny. I didn't think
you could turn a hobby

41:46.537 --> 41:49.173
into a career at your age.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.876
But then, what do I know?

41:51.976 --> 41:55.079
I didn't get into it
for the money.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.548
Of course you didn't.

41:57.648 --> 42:00.918
Well, I suppose every man
must have his arena.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.920
Evidently, this is yours.

42:05.089 --> 42:07.157
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>I can help you with, John?</i>

42:07.224 --> 42:09.994
Uh, no. No,
I'm driving into Boston

42:10.060 --> 42:11.862
to meet with an associate.

42:11.929 --> 42:15.499
I should get moving. Take me
five hours to find parking.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.869
I know
what you're thinking.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.573
I know what you mean,
and it's not true.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.777
What am I thinking, Paul?

42:29.213 --> 42:31.782
That I married Julia
for her money.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.019
Why else?

42:50.935 --> 42:54.138
How sad that you can't see
what I see.

43:07.451 --> 43:08.919
Well?

43:08.986 --> 43:10.554
Julia, it looks wonderful.

43:10.621 --> 43:12.723
Oh, Alice, come see.
It works!

43:12.790 --> 43:16.560
<i>Oh, I've heard all about</i>
<i>the running water from Albert.</i>

43:16.627 --> 43:19.663
Oh, is that where you've been.
With Duke?

43:19.763 --> 43:22.833
I've missed you.
We've all missed you.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.404
Paul was ready to send out
the search brigade.

43:27.471 --> 43:29.773
I was pulled off your show.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.976
Yes, I know.
I heard.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.081
I have found that I've had
the most success

43:37.147 --> 43:39.516
when I've figured out
how to make myself

43:39.617 --> 43:43.988
absolutely necessary
and indispensable.

43:44.088 --> 43:45.956
For such a talent as you,
dear Alice,

43:46.023 --> 43:48.759
I can't imagine that being
too difficult.

44:00.170 --> 44:02.606
Oh.

44:09.046 --> 44:12.483
Ham and pickle,
no crust, no mustard.

44:13.717 --> 44:15.386
Thank you, dear.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.055
You okay, Big John?

44:18.155 --> 44:19.890
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.625
Um, I was gonna drop this
in the mail,

44:21.692 --> 44:25.029
but, uh, now I can save
a stamp this month.

44:25.129 --> 44:26.797
Well, thanks, Pop.

44:29.066 --> 44:31.335
You sure you can't stay?

44:31.402 --> 44:33.037
You'd get to watch the show
being taped.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.205
You'd be my very first
live audience.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.508
No, I'm sorry.
I really need to get down

44:37.574 --> 44:39.576
to my meetings in New York.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.245
Business is business.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.580
Well, you should know
all about that by now,

44:43.681 --> 44:45.683
what with everything
you've got on your plate.

44:45.749 --> 44:48.218
Yes, I feel like
you and Gramps,

44:48.318 --> 44:50.988
taking big risks and...

44:51.055 --> 44:52.423
this leap of faith.

44:52.523 --> 44:56.093
You're your
father's daughter now, are you?

44:56.193 --> 44:57.828
I am.

44:59.763 --> 45:02.266
Let's not let another year
go by.

45:02.366 --> 45:04.902
I'm going to be sad
when you go.

45:05.002 --> 45:07.204
It's been such a nice visit.

45:07.271 --> 45:08.605
It certainly was.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.775
Phila and I will look forward
to your next trip out west.

45:11.875 --> 45:15.913
And if you wanted to come alone,
that would be even better.

45:20.451 --> 45:21.585
Dad?

45:21.685 --> 45:23.020
Yeah?

45:24.722 --> 45:25.622
Oh, it's nothing.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.192
Can I give you a hand?

45:28.258 --> 45:29.727
I'm alright.

45:29.793 --> 45:31.695
Why won't you let me help you?

45:31.762 --> 45:34.565
We're all here to help.

45:34.631 --> 45:36.633
Julia.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.235
Be a lady?

45:38.302 --> 45:40.971
Be a lady.

45:41.071 --> 45:44.274
I am a lady, Dad.
Just not your type.

45:45.709 --> 45:47.745
And that's okay.

45:47.811 --> 45:51.648
You always gave me
everything I needed,

45:51.749 --> 45:53.917
and I love you for that.

45:54.952 --> 45:57.921
Well, good.

46:01.592 --> 46:04.461
And I need one more thing.

46:23.247 --> 46:24.681
Like Jayne Mansfield.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.483
Oh!

46:26.583 --> 46:28.085
Isn't she
a Playboy bunny?

46:28.152 --> 46:29.753
It's never too late, love.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.522
I agree. Beautiful.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.358
Thank you.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.493
Maybe on Sunday

46:36.593 --> 46:39.763
we can celebrate
with some champagne on the pier.

46:39.830 --> 46:40.998
We have class on Sunday.

46:41.098 --> 46:42.800
No, we don't.
I've found a way

46:42.866 --> 46:46.036
to cover expenses
for the show.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.038
And I'm paying
for a babysitter.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.873
Oh, I couldn't.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.176
Oh, you can, and you shall.

46:52.276 --> 46:55.445
Julia, we need you.

46:55.512 --> 46:57.381
Alright, crazy kids,

46:57.481 --> 46:59.183
let's give this a try!

47:01.285 --> 47:03.620
Everybody in
positions, please.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.726
One moment, please.

47:15.866 --> 47:17.568
Very nervous.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.404
Don't be nervous, darling,
whatever happens.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.708
Thank you.

47:39.189 --> 47:41.758
Here we go with Episode 1.

47:46.563 --> 47:49.099
Talk to Binky. Talk to Binky.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.367
Talk to Binky.

47:50.434 --> 47:53.370
And quiet on set, please!

47:53.437 --> 47:58.041
We're ready in 5, 4, 3...

48:03.747 --> 48:05.782
I'm Julia Child.
