01:44.230 --> 01:47.776
WELL, THERE'S YOUR RECEIPT
AND 25 CENTS CHANGE.

01:47.942 --> 01:48.985
THANK YOU KINDLY.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.945
WELL, MY CORNMEAL
IS HERE TO SELL.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.447
I KNOW.

01:52.614 --> 01:54.574
YOU COULD MAKE A LOT MORE ON
IT, THOUGH, IF YOU WANTED TO.

01:54.741 --> 01:57.285
THERE'S NOT A POOR FAMILY IN THESE
PARTS THAT'S NOT IN YOUR DEBT.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.329
WE COULD NEVER AFFORD
HANSON'S PRICES.

01:59.496 --> 02:00.914
WELL, NOW,
DON'T BLAME HANSON.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.250
I WAS JUST LUCKY AND MADE A
GOOD DEAL ON THIS CORNMEAL.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.377
IT'S NO MORE THAN RIGHT
FOLKS SHOULD BENEFIT.

02:06.544 --> 02:07.921
WE APPRECIATE IT.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.924
THANKS AGAIN. YOU'LL BE
IN MY FAMILY'S PRAYERS.

02:11.090 --> 02:11.925
GOOD-BYE.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.176
GOOD-BYE.

02:35.573 --> 02:36.908
DID YOU SEE THAT?

02:37.075 --> 02:38.451
WHAT'S THAT?

02:38.618 --> 02:41.204
BOULTON JUST WENT UP THE STREET
WITH A LOAD OF CORNMEAL.

02:41.371 --> 02:43.373
THE LAST 3 DAYS, EVERYBODY'S
BEEN GOING UP THE STREET

02:43.540 --> 02:44.791
WITH A LOAD
OF CORNMEAL.

02:44.958 --> 02:47.210
I DON'T KNOW HOW
PETERSON DOES IT.

02:47.377 --> 02:49.462
GOING TO HAVE TO
LOWER YOUR PRICES.

02:49.629 --> 02:51.965
WELL, CHARLES KNOWS
I CAN'T DO THAT.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.967
I'M JUST
BREAKING EVEN NOW.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.385
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

02:55.552 --> 02:58.805
WELL, I JUST HAVE TO HOPE
THAT HE RUNS OUT.

02:58.972 --> 03:00.765
WILL YOU HAVE
THAT ORDER READY TODAY?

03:00.932 --> 03:01.975
Charles:
RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.810
GOOD.

03:11.651 --> 03:17.866
I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE
HE GOT CORNMEAL AT THAT PRICE.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.994
CORNMEAL THING SURE
BOTHERING HIM, ISN'T IT?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.745
I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.998
HE'S GOT A LOT OF FLOUR TO
SELL, INCLUDING SOME OF MINE.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.499
WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.334
FRIEND OR NO,

03:28.501 --> 03:30.461
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET ME A
COUPLE OF SACKS OVER AT PETERSON'S.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.005
YEAH, I DON'T BLAME YOU.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.465
IT'S ALL GOOD WHEN THE BREAD
COMES OUT OF THE OVEN.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.301
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.828
SUPPER'S READY!

04:07.165 --> 04:08.458
GOTCHA!

04:08.625 --> 04:10.209
I LET YOU CATCH ME!

04:10.376 --> 04:13.755
YEAH? WELL, YOU'RE GETTING TOO
FAST FOR ME, YOU LITTLE PUMPKIN.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.258
MMM! THAT SMELLS GOOD.

04:19.594 --> 04:21.471
TWO LOAVES FOR ONE SUPPER?

04:21.638 --> 04:22.847
TWO LOAVES, PAUL.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.891
AND NOT BECAUSE
IT'S A SPECIAL DAY, EITHER.

04:25.058 --> 04:26.893
WE CAN HAVE TWO LOAVES
WHENEVER WE WANT,

04:27.060 --> 04:28.436
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, SYLVIE?

04:28.603 --> 04:29.938
THANKS TO
MR. PETERSON.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.481
WELL, COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

04:31.648 --> 04:33.274
LT'LL GET COLD.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.410
WE THANK YOU, O LORD,
FOR BLESSING US THIS DAY

04:44.577 --> 04:47.330
WITH THE FOOD
WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO EAT,

04:47.497 --> 04:51.417
AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
MR. PETERSON TO OUR TOWN.

04:51.584 --> 04:54.545
BLESS HIM AND KEEP HIM
FROM HARM.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.005
AMEN.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.423
- AMEN.
- AMEN.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.467
YOU SURE YOU WON'T
HAVE SOME MORE?

04:59.634 --> 05:01.386
I COULDN'T EAT
ANOTHER BITE.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.971
HALF-PINT, I WANT YOU
TO FINISH THAT MEAT.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.555
BUT IT HURTS
WHEN I CHEW.

05:04.722 --> 05:05.473
WHAT HURTS?

05:05.640 --> 05:07.058
MY TOOTH IN THE WAY BACK.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.060
OPEN UP. LET ME SEE.

05:09.227 --> 05:10.979
WIDE. WIDE. LET ME SEE.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.439
WHICH ONE?

05:13.606 --> 05:14.983
THIS ONE HERE?

05:15.149 --> 05:16.442
UH-HUH.

05:16.609 --> 05:17.944
IT'S NOT LOOSE.

05:18.111 --> 05:19.112
BUT IT HURTS.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.571
WELL, IT COULD BE
A BAD TOOTH.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.365
I'LL TAKE YOU IN TO SEE
DOC BAKER TOMORROW.

05:22.532 --> 05:24.117
MEANTIME,
JUST DRINK YOUR MILK.

05:24.283 --> 05:27.286
LAURA, THAT'S WHAT COMES OF SNITCHING
SUGAR OUT OF THE CUPBOARD.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.872
SWEETS ARE THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR TEETH.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.290
CAN DY'S SWEET,
ISN'T IT?

05:31.457 --> 05:34.293
YES, AND VERY MUCH OF IT
IS VERY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.421
WELL, NELLIE AND WILLIE
EAT CANDY ALL THE TIME--

05:36.587 --> 05:37.922
EVEN FOR LUNCH
SOMETIMES--

05:38.089 --> 05:39.132
AND THEIR TEETH
ARE FINE.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.967
I KNOW WILLIE'S ARE.
HE BIT ME ONCE.

05:41.134 --> 05:42.427
Charles: HE BIT YOU?

05:42.593 --> 05:43.803
UH-HUH.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.764
WELL, IF HE DOES IT AGAIN,
I WANT YOU TO CUFF HIM GOOD.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.475
CHARLES.

05:49.642 --> 05:50.810
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

05:50.977 --> 05:53.771
I'LL NOT HAVE ANY BITING.
HE NEEDS A LESSON.

05:55.148 --> 05:56.399
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.985
IF HE BITES YOU AGAIN,
CUFF HIM GOOD.

05:59.152 --> 06:00.403
I ALREADY DID!

06:00.570 --> 06:01.904
I'M THROUGH.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.741
AND AS FOR YOUR TEETH AND
EATING CANDY, YOU WAIT AND SEE.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.827
NELLIE AND WILLIE ARE GOING TO
HAVE BAD ONES IN A FEW YEARS.

06:07.994 --> 06:09.495
YOU CAN FETCH SOME WATER
FOR THE DISHES.

06:09.662 --> 06:10.830
YES, PA.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.458
I TOLD NELLIE HER TEETH
WOULD FALL OUT.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.834
SHE DIDN'T CARE.

06:15.001 --> 06:18.296
SHE'D JUST BUY TEETH
LIKE HER MOTHER HAS.

06:18.463 --> 06:21.674
I DIDN'T KNOW MRS. OLESON
HAD STORE-BOUGHTEN TEETH.

06:21.841 --> 06:25.595
WELL, HOW COULD YOU TELL?
SHE NEVER SMILES.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.014
AHHH.

06:28.181 --> 06:29.182
AHHH.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.017
MM. GOOD.

06:31.184 --> 06:33.269
MM-HMM.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.939
GOING TO HAVE
TO PULL IT?

06:37.106 --> 06:38.775
WELL, THAT ALL DEPENDS.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.360
IT'S A FIRST TOOTH, SO
lT'LL FALL OUT EVENTUALLY,

06:41.527 --> 06:43.988
BUT IF IT HURTS REAL BAD,
IT MIGHT BE INFECTED.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.990
SO IT SHOULD COME OUT.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.533
I CAN HARDLY
FEEL IT.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.285
LAURA?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.999
I GUESS YOU
BETTER PULL IT.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.501
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.877
BUT I'M SCARED.

06:58.044 --> 06:59.545
SO AM I.

06:59.712 --> 07:04.425
I NEVER KNOW WHEN MY PATIENTS ARE
GOING TO BITE ONE OF MY FINGERS OFF.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.468
[KNOCK KNOCK]

07:05.635 --> 07:06.886
DOCTOR?

07:07.053 --> 07:08.971
Dr. Baker:
BACK HERE!

07:09.138 --> 07:10.890
Charles: BOULTON.

07:11.057 --> 07:12.391
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.894
NONSENSE. I'M ONLY IN THE
MIDDLE OF MAJOR SURGERY.

07:15.061 --> 07:16.229
WHAT IS IT?

07:16.395 --> 07:19.440
IT'S ABOUT MY BOY.
HE'S DOWN WITH A FEVER.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.984
HE'S HAD IT
A COUPLE OF DAYS NOW.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.861
WELL, CAN'T YOU
BRING HIM IN?

07:24.028 --> 07:25.863
WELL, I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD COME OUT.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.365
HE'S SO WEAK
FROM THE FEVER,

07:27.532 --> 07:29.492
I HATE TO BUNDLE HIM UP
AND TAKE HIM.

07:29.659 --> 07:30.952
ALL RIGHT.

07:31.119 --> 07:33.955
ALL RIGHT, BOULTON. I'LL BE
OUT THIS AFTERNOON, HMM?

07:34.122 --> 07:35.414
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.582
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

07:36.749 --> 07:37.917
Charles: HOPE HE'S
FEELING BETTER.

07:38.084 --> 07:39.252
THANK YOU.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.758
WELL, DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

07:46.968 --> 07:50.304
YOU CAN PUT YOUR TOOTH
UNDER YOUR PILLOW TONIGHT,

07:50.471 --> 07:55.393
AND THE TOOTH FAIRY MIGHT
JUST LEAVE YOU A PENNY.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.770
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY
ABOUT THAT?

08:02.567 --> 08:04.902
I'D JUST AS SOON
NOT HAVE A PENNY.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.930
[KNOCK KNOCK]

08:34.056 --> 08:35.933
OH, THANK YOU, DOCTOR,
FOR COMING OUT.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.768
HE'S IN THE BACK HERE.

08:46.402 --> 08:51.991
WELL, PAUL, YOU REALLY MUST BE FEELING
BAD, STAYING IN BED ON SATURDAY.

08:52.158 --> 08:53.409
YES, SIR.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.994
HE'S REALLY BURNING UP,
DOCTOR.

08:55.161 --> 08:57.914
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.499
HOW LONG HAS
HE HAD THE FEVER?

09:00.666 --> 09:01.834
4 OR 5 DAYS.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.962
WASN'T BAD AT FIRST.
I THOUGHT lT'D PASS.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.466
HOW DO YOU FEEL, PAUL?

09:08.633 --> 09:09.884
NOT SO GOOD.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.844
YEAH, WELL, I KNOW THAT.

09:12.011 --> 09:14.931
I MEAN YOU GOT
ANY ACHES OR PAINS?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.974
I FEEL KIND OF SORE.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.351
WHERE?

09:18.517 --> 09:21.812
ALL OVER, KIND OF,
AND MY HEAD HURTS.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.193
NOW PUT THIS
UNDER YOUR TONGUE

09:27.360 --> 09:30.988
AND PURSE YOUR LIPS AROUND IT
LIKE YOU WAS SIPPING CIDER.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.387
HOW HIGH IS
MY TEMPERATURE?

09:57.056 --> 09:59.433
OH, DOCTORS NEVER
GIVE OUT INFORMATION.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.394
WHY NOT?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.853
WELL,
BECAUSE IF THEY DID,

10:03.020 --> 10:04.855
THE PATIENTS WOULD END UP
KNOWING EVERYTHING,

10:05.022 --> 10:07.817
AND WE'D BE OUT OF A JOB.

10:07.984 --> 10:11.904
ERIC, UH, I WANT YOU TO GO
INTO TOWN, PICK UP SOME ICE.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.990
I WANT TO GET
THE BOY'S FEVER DOWN.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.449
WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR?

10:15.616 --> 10:18.411
I CAN'T BE SURE...YET.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.288
HE'S GOT A PRETTY
GOOD FEVER GOING,

10:20.454 --> 10:24.417
BUT I'VE SEEN FEVERS LIKE THIS
COME AND GO LIKE NOTHING,

10:24.583 --> 10:27.003
SO THERE'S NO USE
WORRYING.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.297
NOW GO GET THAT ICE.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.884

TO GET SOME RAGS.

COUNTING?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.746

25 TEETH.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.998
WHY DO YOU CARE HOW
MANY TEETH YOU HAVE?

11:46.165 --> 11:48.751
WELL, THEY CALL COME OUT,
I'D HAVE 25 CENTS.

11:48.918 --> 11:50.044
COUNTING THE ONE
UNDER MY PILLOW,

11:50.211 --> 11:52.880
I'D HAVE 26 CENTS.

11:53.047 --> 11:58.010
THEN I COULD BUY ALL THE CANDY
IN OELSON'S MERCANTILE.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.929
WHAT GOOD WOULD
IT DO YOU?

12:00.096 --> 12:02.681

ABOUT POLAR BEARS

I'D LIKE TO ADD ONE THOUGHT.

14:05.513 --> 14:08.807
LET'S TRY TO HOLD ON TO THAT FEELING
OF LOVE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK,

14:08.974 --> 14:10.643
NOT JUST ON SUNDAY.

I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT
LIKE THIS, REVEREND.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.699
I'VE JUST COME FROM
THE BOULTON PLACE.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.952
SYLVIE BOULTON DIED
EARLY THIS MORNING.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.042
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS YET.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.419
THE BOY'S SICK WITH IT, TOO.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.338
BUT UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE,

14:39.505 --> 14:42.383
I WANT EVERYONE TO STAY
AT THEIR OWN PLACE.

14:43.509 --> 14:48.138
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT IS, DOCTOR?

14:51.141 --> 14:52.935
I'M NOT POSITIVE,

14:53.102 --> 14:55.688
BUT I THINK IT'S TYPHUS.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.274
OH, NO.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.261
I WISH I COULD
GO HUNTING, PA.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.971
WELL, JUST 'CAUSE THERE'S
NO REGULAR SCHOOL,

15:29.138 --> 15:31.307

IT'S STILL HOT, PA.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.465
YOU GIRLS GET INSIDE
AND FINISH YOUR SUPPER.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.969
I DON'T WANT YOU ALL
SKINNY WHEN I GET HOME.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.929
Laura and Mary:
YES, PA.

34:33.823 --> 34:35.950
YOU LOOK SO TIRED.

34:39.787 --> 34:41.372
I AM.

34:46.711 --> 34:49.380
I BURIED
ANOTHER ONE TODAY.

34:51.215 --> 34:53.885
IT WAS NOBODY WE KNEW.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.392
JUST A LITTLE OLD MAN
LMNG BY HIMSELF.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.273
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HIS NAME.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.151
I COULDN'T PUT IT
ON THE CROSS.

35:12.737 --> 35:15.072
YOU MUST HAVE FAITH.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.174
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

35:35.927 --> 35:37.970
YOU KNOW, STANDING
OUT HERE LIKE THIS,

35:38.137 --> 35:39.764
I FEEL LIKE I'M
COURTING YOU AGAIN.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.891
HA HA HA!

35:42.058 --> 35:45.394
IF YOU WERE, MY MA AND PA WOULD
BE STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

35:45.561 --> 35:48.856
YOUR PA DID KEEP AN EYE
ON ME, DIDN'T HE?

35:49.023 --> 35:51.567
HA HA HA!

35:53.611 --> 35:57.281
I SURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
YOUR FOLKS AGAIN SOMEDAY.

36:06.791 --> 36:08.376
I GOT TO GO.

36:15.258 --> 36:16.926
SEE YOU
DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.544
ANY MORE TODAY?

36:51.711 --> 36:54.213
3. I'M GETTING
MORE ICE.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.507
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO TO HOLD THE FEVER DOWN

36:56.674 --> 36:58.509
WHEN THE ICE IS GONE.

36:58.676 --> 37:00.595
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

37:56.776 --> 37:59.070
THERE YOU GO, DOC.

37:59.236 --> 38:00.571
THANK YOU, INGALLS.

38:00.738 --> 38:03.407
I'LL GO GET YOU
SOME MORE.

38:11.082 --> 38:13.125
HE RODE IN
THIS AFTERNOON.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.422
[WIND GUSTING]

39:37.668 --> 39:38.919
Charles: DOC?

39:41.881 --> 39:44.508
JUST TAKE IT EASY
REST EASY.

39:44.675 --> 39:45.718
I'M ALL RIGHT.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.637
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
JUST REST.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.483
IF WE COULD ONLY
FIND THE SOURCE.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.443
HOW YOU GONNA
FIND IT?

40:02.610 --> 40:05.029
IT'S COMING
FROM EVERYWHERE.

40:05.196 --> 40:08.699
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

40:08.866 --> 40:11.911
THEY LIVE SO FAR APART.

40:12.078 --> 40:18.542
THERE COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ANY CONTACT.

40:18.709 --> 40:21.962
WE DON'T FIND THE SOURCE,

40:22.129 --> 40:25.674
BE NO WAY TO STOP IT,
NO WAY.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.061
IF YOU WANT,
I'LL TAKE THE ICE.

40:37.228 --> 40:38.020
I CAN MAKE IT.

40:38.187 --> 40:39.188
I KNOW YOU CAN
MAKE IT.

40:39.355 --> 40:41.065
I'LL STILL GET
THE ICE.

40:41.232 --> 40:42.817
THANK YOU.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.459
Reverend: DOCTOR?

41:06.966 --> 41:09.093
Girl:
MR. INGALLS?

41:18.561 --> 41:19.854
LESLIE?

41:20.020 --> 41:24.483
MY MA AND PA
ALL RIGHT?

41:24.650 --> 41:26.277
THEY'RE FINE.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.281
I WAS OUT TO SEE THEM
THIS MORNING.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.826
THEY WANTED TO SEND YOU
A WHOLE MESS OF CORNBREAD,

41:33.993 --> 41:35.870
BUT I TOLD THEM IT
WOULD BE A LITTLE WHILE

41:36.036 --> 41:38.330
BEFORE YOU GOT
YOUR APPETITE BACK.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.625
"FEED A COLD, STARVE
A FEVER," MA SAYS.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.420
YOUR MA'S RIGHT.

41:51.051 --> 41:53.888
I WONDER IF
I'M GOING TO DIE.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.142
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
JUST FINE.

41:58.309 --> 42:00.895
I'M NOT SCARED.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.397
I KNOW I'LL GO
TO HEAVEN,

42:03.564 --> 42:06.150
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU DIE IN CHURCH.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.489
NO MORE TALK OF DYING,
ALL RIGHT?

42:12.656 --> 42:14.283
YOU JUST GET SOME SLEEP.

42:15.701 --> 42:17.286
ALL RIGHT.

42:58.035 --> 43:00.829
WELL, NURSE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

43:00.996 --> 43:03.874
WELL, YOUR FEVER'S
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

43:04.041 --> 43:06.752
IT OUGHT TO BE.
YOU NEAR FROZE ME SOLID.

43:08.003 --> 43:10.464
HALF-PINT AND THE OTHERS--
THEY STILL ALL RIGHT?

43:10.631 --> 43:11.757
THEY'RE FINE.

43:11.924 --> 43:12.841
GOOD.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.009
HOW YOU FEELING?

43:14.176 --> 43:17.763
WELL, YOU CAN'T KILL
A GRIZZLY BEAR.

43:19.473 --> 43:21.225
IF THOSE CORN DODGERS OF
YOURS DON'T KILL YOU,

43:21.392 --> 43:22.893
I GUESS NOTHING WILL.

43:23.060 --> 43:25.938
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE
I USED PETERSON'S CORNMEAL

43:26.105 --> 43:27.356
INSTEAD OF YOUR FLOUR.

43:27.523 --> 43:29.275
PROBABLY.

43:35.531 --> 43:37.908
YOU BOUGHT THAT
CORNMEAL AT PETERSON'S?

43:38.075 --> 43:39.410
YEAH.

43:39.576 --> 43:41.537
TWO SACKS
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.462
GET SOME REST, HUH?

43:50.629 --> 43:52.047
DOC? I THINK I GOT IT.

43:52.214 --> 43:53.382
WHAT?

43:53.549 --> 43:55.301
PETERSON'S. THE CORNMEAL
AT PETERSON'S.

43:55.467 --> 43:58.429
EDWARDS BOUGHT SOME. I KNOW
LESLIE'S PARENTS HAD SOME,

43:58.595 --> 44:00.806
AND I SAW A SACK OF IT
AT BOULTON'S.

44:12.192 --> 44:14.278
IT'S LOCKED!

44:18.741 --> 44:19.825
PETERSON!

44:19.992 --> 44:21.076
[BANGING ON DOOR]

44:21.243 --> 44:22.369
PETERSON!

44:26.749 --> 44:28.334
PETERSON.

44:31.128 --> 44:33.464
THE KEYS TO THE SHED.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.758
THE KEYS!

44:49.646 --> 44:51.482
I GOT THEM.

45:20.010 --> 45:23.889
ALL THIS TIME,
IT'S A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY.

45:24.056 --> 45:26.433
WE'LL GET PETERSON
TO THE CHURCH,

45:26.600 --> 45:28.811
BURN THIS PLACE
TO THE GROUND.

45:55.421 --> 45:57.256
Laura, voice-over:
IT WAS OVER, PA SAID.

45:57.423 --> 46:00.884
HE WOULD STAY IN TOWN AND HELP DR.
BAKER UNTIL THE DANGER PASSED.

46:01.051 --> 46:03.804
WE COUNTED THE DAYS
TILL HE WOULD COME HOME.

46:26.994 --> 46:28.954
WELL, REVEREND,
THAT CHURCH OF YOURS

46:29.121 --> 46:31.874
WILL SMELL LIKE ROTTEN EGGS
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

46:32.040 --> 46:34.293
BUT THE SULFUR
WILL MAKE IT SAFE.

46:34.460 --> 46:38.422
WELL, WE'LL NOT SOON
FORGET THESE LAST WEEKS.

46:38.589 --> 46:41.175
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT
TO UNDERSTAND

46:41.341 --> 46:44.928
WHY GOD ALLOWS THINGS
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

46:45.095 --> 46:46.722
BUT SOMEHOW
WHEN IT'S ALL OVER,

46:46.889 --> 46:48.724
INSTEAD OF BEING
WEAKENED BY IT,

46:48.891 --> 46:52.102
WE FIND WE'RE MADE
STRONGER.

46:54.771 --> 46:56.940
GOD BLESS YOU,
GENTLEMEN.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.489
EDWARDS?

47:03.655 --> 47:06.950
ARE YOU SURE YOU BOILED THOSE
CLOTHES OUT REAL GOOD?

47:07.117 --> 47:09.953
BOILED THEM? THEY'RE SO CLEAN,
THEY'RE DOWNRIGHT UNCOMFORTABLE.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.540
DOC, WHY DON'T YOU GO TO SLEEP
FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS, HUH?

47:13.707 --> 47:15.083
I JUST MIGHT
DO THAT, INGALLS.

47:15.250 --> 47:16.668
THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

47:16.835 --> 47:17.920
THANK YOU.

47:27.179 --> 47:29.139
CAROLINE'S GOT
A SPECIAL SUPPER GOING.

47:29.306 --> 47:30.599
HOW ABOUT JOINING US?

47:30.766 --> 47:32.476
OH, WELL,
THANK YOU KINDLY,

47:32.643 --> 47:35.437
BUT YOU KNOW HOMECOMINGS ARE
KIND OF JUST FOR FAMILY.

47:35.604 --> 47:38.190
EDWARDS, WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO LEARN YOU ARE FAMILY, HUH?

47:38.357 --> 47:39.942
COME ON.
