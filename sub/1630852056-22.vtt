00:00.333 --> 00:03.000
[Haley] She took part in doing
cocaine in the apartment,

00:03.066 --> 00:06.266
and I did not feel safe
being around illegal drug use.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.033
[Michael] It's just an excuse,
Your Honor.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.700
There were other people
in the apartment also using.

00:12.934 --> 00:14.600
That doesn't make it better.

00:16.567 --> 00:18.166
You should have a discussion
with your daughter.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.767

Court come to order. All rise.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.300
Be seated, please.

00:51.567 --> 00:55.233
[Kevin] Hello, Judge. Case number
1051, Martinez versus Violich.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.567
[Judge Judy]
Mr. Martinez, you're a cosigner?

00:59.633 --> 01:01.166
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's always a problem.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.767
- Yes, ma'am.
- This is your daughter?

01:02.834 --> 01:05.000
- Yes.
- What college does she go to?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.600
Chapman University.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.533
- Where is that?
- City of Orange, California.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.800
And where do you live?

01:09.867 --> 01:11.200
I live in Santa Cruz, California.

01:11.266 --> 01:14.433
- How far away?
- About 350 miles north of here.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.834
- What year is she in?
- She is entering her junior year.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.600
So was it last year that she leased
the apartment with some friends?

01:20.667 --> 01:21.667
Yes.

01:21.734 --> 01:23.934
What month was that?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.600
It was October.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.133
- September.
- Oh, September, sorry.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.333
- September of 2020?
- Yes.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.934
Why don't you come up
and stand with your dad.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Tell me your first name.

01:33.066 --> 01:34.066
Haley.

01:34.133 --> 01:36.433
Were you in school
virtually most of last year?

01:36.500 --> 01:38.734
Yeah, pretty much
all of last year was online.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.166
What month did you leave?

01:40.233 --> 01:42.100
- Leave?
- School.

01:42.166 --> 01:43.667
- You were in school in September?
- Right.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.734
Well, we went--we got sent home
in March of 2020.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.300
And then I moved back down to Orange
hoping that we'd be in person,

01:50.367 --> 01:51.467
but it remained online.

01:51.533 --> 01:55.600
So your lease went
from September of 2020

01:55.667 --> 01:59.266
until August 31st of 2021?

01:59.333 --> 02:01.767
June 26th of 2021.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.967
How many roommates
did you have, Haley?

02:04.033 --> 02:05.633
I had three other roommates,

02:05.700 --> 02:07.900
me and one other roommate
stayed through the lease

02:07.967 --> 02:09.700
and then two of the roommates left.

02:09.767 --> 02:13.166
So you stayed through the lease
but went to school virtually?

02:13.233 --> 02:15.233
- Right.
- And two went home?

02:15.300 --> 02:18.834
Yeah, like in around January
they went home.

02:18.900 --> 02:19.900
Tell me your first name.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.600
- Sophia.
- Sophia?

02:21.667 --> 02:23.300
You were one of the roommates?

02:23.367 --> 02:24.967
- Yes.
- When did you leave?

02:25.033 --> 02:28.066
I left around December 20th.

02:28.133 --> 02:29.734
And what was your share of the rent?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.266
It was about 640.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.367
- Your share?
- Yes.

02:33.433 --> 02:34.433
Must've been a nice place?

02:34.500 --> 02:36.767
- Yeah, it was a nice place.
- Okay.

02:36.834 --> 02:39.100
And how old were you
when you moved in?

02:39.166 --> 02:40.667
Twenty--or nineteen, sorry.

02:40.734 --> 02:43.033
- And you also signed the lease?
- Yes.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.400
After December,
did you pay the lease?

02:45.467 --> 02:47.100
Yes, up until January.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.233
January, what?

02:48.300 --> 02:50.100
I paid January's rent.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.934
You did pay January's rent?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.033
Okay. You didn't pay February,
is that correct?

02:55.100 --> 02:56.266
- Yes.
- March?

02:56.333 --> 02:57.400
[Sophia] Yes.

02:57.467 --> 02:58.500
- April?
- Yes.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.600
- May?
- Yes.

03:00.667 --> 03:03.166
And the lease was up in June?

03:03.233 --> 03:04.934
- The end of June, yes.
- Or June?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
July 1st. Yes.

03:06.066 --> 03:07.367
But you didn't pay for those five months?

03:07.433 --> 03:08.700
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.834
Now, you understood
that you signed a lease?

03:10.900 --> 03:13.266
- Yes.
- And that the plaintiff,

03:13.333 --> 03:15.700
Mr. Martinez, paid all the rent.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.967
Did the other roommates,
there were two other roommates,

03:19.033 --> 03:20.767
did they pay their share of the rent?

03:20.834 --> 03:23.533
One of the other roommates
who stayed with Haley

03:23.600 --> 03:25.367
for the rest of the remainder of the lease

03:25.433 --> 03:27.667
paid it on time every month,

03:27.734 --> 03:30.667
and the other roommate

03:30.734 --> 03:32.867
left with her at the same time.

03:32.934 --> 03:34.300
- Did she pay?
- [Michael] No.

03:34.367 --> 03:37.433
She stopped paying at the same--
she paid through January

03:37.500 --> 03:39.834
and stopped paying in February.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.066
Is there any reason
why you didn't sue her?

03:42.133 --> 03:43.467
We have a case against her. Yes.

03:43.533 --> 03:44.200
- You do?
- Yes.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.800
- Pending?
- On Monday we have--our court date.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.066
- Yes.
- Great. Okay.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.266
Sophia, ball is in your court.

03:50.333 --> 03:53.767
You're a grown-up.
You're an adult, you signed the lease.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.033
He cosigned the lease.
He paid the lease in full.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.467
- I assume you are employed, sir.
- Yes.

03:59.533 --> 04:02.266
- What kind of work do you do?
- I am a union electrician.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.967
He gets paid salary,

04:04.033 --> 04:06.900
didn't want his salary garnished
or his credit ruined,

04:06.967 --> 04:08.567
so he paid the lease.

04:08.633 --> 04:11.166
You have to give me a convincing reason

04:11.233 --> 04:14.700
why you're not responsible
for the remainder of the lease.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.467
So, I have...

04:17.533 --> 04:20.867
Don't look over there.
Look over here.

04:20.934 --> 04:23.633
So I have an immune disorder,
type-one diabetes,

04:23.700 --> 04:28.033
and in October, the other roommate

04:28.100 --> 04:31.200
that shared a room with Haley
got COVID--

04:31.266 --> 04:33.533
Okay, just one second.
Did you get COVID?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.400
- No.
- No? Who got COVID?

04:35.467 --> 04:37.633
- The other roommate.
- Okay. And...

04:37.700 --> 04:41.934
And I really did not feel safe
being in that apartment, and then also--

04:42.000 --> 04:44.533
Just a second.
So, you left in October?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.033
End of October. Yes.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.367
- That's not true...
- Shh.

04:47.433 --> 04:48.900
Don't.

04:48.967 --> 04:52.133
You left the end of October,
but then you came back?

04:52.200 --> 04:53.767
- Yes.
- When did you come back?

04:53.834 --> 04:58.066
I left October, around October 15th.

04:58.133 --> 05:01.000
And then I came back for a week

05:01.066 --> 05:05.767
and then I left again in November 4th.

05:05.834 --> 05:09.000
And then I didn't come back
until Christmastime for a week.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.467
What was all the back and forth?

05:10.533 --> 05:12.300
I didn't feel safe in the apartment
also from--

05:12.367 --> 05:14.867
So then, why did you
come back at all?

05:14.934 --> 05:16.333
All my things were there.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.867
- That takes an hour.
- Yeah.

05:17.934 --> 05:19.967
Where did you go when you left?

05:20.033 --> 05:21.500
Back home to Santa Cruz.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.734
- Who did you stay with?
- My parents.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.867
- All the time?
- Yes.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.633
So each time you went back,
you stayed with your parents?

05:28.700 --> 05:29.934
- Yes.
- Christmastime.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.600
- Was there school?
- Yes.

05:31.667 --> 05:32.967
- Virtually?
- Yes.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.300
What date did you move out?

05:34.367 --> 05:39.800
I put everything in my car and moved
all my things out December 20th

05:39.867 --> 05:43.100
besides the beds that we were
gonna to give to someone

05:43.166 --> 05:44.333
if they end up moving in.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.767
Okay. So you moved out,

05:46.834 --> 05:49.934
I still haven't heard a reason
other than the general,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.333
"I didn't feel safe."

05:51.400 --> 05:54.433
The other reasons are Haley

05:54.500 --> 05:57.033
took part in doing cocaine
in the apartment,

05:57.100 --> 06:01.133
and I did not feel safe
being around illegal drug use

06:01.200 --> 06:02.467
- as I don't partake...
- Okay.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.633
- ...in that things.
- Okay.

06:03.700 --> 06:08.133
And when do you allege, at least,

06:08.200 --> 06:11.300
Haley used an illegal substance
in the house?

06:11.367 --> 06:12.567
- What...
- Like every weekend.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.500
Every weekend, since when?

06:14.567 --> 06:17.300
Since we moved in,
at September 4th.

06:17.367 --> 06:19.500
Okay. Well, you stayed there September,

06:19.567 --> 06:23.000
October, November, and December.

06:23.066 --> 06:26.567
And if you say that this illegal drug use

06:26.633 --> 06:28.367
was going on for four months,

06:28.433 --> 06:31.700
why didn't you notify her father and say,

06:31.767 --> 06:34.266
"I'm moving out because
there's drug use in the house"?

06:34.333 --> 06:36.567
- Instead you stayed.
- I know that...

06:36.633 --> 06:39.233
I mean, I'm not saying that it's true.
I'm not even going into it.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.600
I'm just saying,
why didn't you just leave?

06:41.667 --> 06:45.533
And you did come back Christmastime
and stayed for several weeks?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.767
To pack up my things, yes.

06:46.834 --> 06:49.000
It doesn't take several weeks
to pack up your things.

06:49.066 --> 06:52.834
It takes you and your parents
an hour to pack up your things

06:52.900 --> 06:56.333
if you're complaining
that there's an unsafe condition?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.100
It's just an excuse,
Your Honor, for her to...

06:58.166 --> 07:01.367
[Judge Judy] Just--I'm waiting.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.166
Yeah, an excuse.

07:03.233 --> 07:07.333
So, yeah, I-I did take that long
to get my things.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.934
I did bring it upon Heidi Martinez,
Michael Martinez's his wife,

07:11.000 --> 07:12.300
and she told me I was...

07:12.367 --> 07:13.834
No, don't told me what she told you.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.734
When did you speak to Mrs. Martinez?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.433
It was back and forth in, um,

07:20.500 --> 07:22.533
I'm not sure on the dates, but...

07:22.600 --> 07:24.133
You spoke to her on the phone?

07:24.200 --> 07:26.667
...October--the phone,
and over text message.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.367
I'd like to see the text messages.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.900
[Kevin] Oh, I got it. Stay there.

07:36.967 --> 07:37.967
Thank you.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.533
These messages are from January.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
I'm sorry, then maybe.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.800
Well the messages from January in--

07:52.867 --> 07:54.300
were after you moved out,

07:54.367 --> 07:56.700
and you spoke to her mother and,

07:56.767 --> 07:58.433
"Hey, Heidi, it would be
much appreciated,

07:58.500 --> 08:00.433
and a big weight off everyone's shoulder

08:00.500 --> 08:03.734
if you will give this nice lady
and her boyfriend

08:03.800 --> 08:07.700
that I've been talking to
about me and room.

08:07.767 --> 08:10.600
They seem reliable
and both have full-time jobs.

08:10.667 --> 08:14.300
It's definitely hard times for everyone
right now with COVID,

08:14.367 --> 08:18.900
so finding a roommate is extra tricky,
but this match makes sense.

08:18.967 --> 08:21.500
It's irrational to be picky
finding a roommate

08:21.567 --> 08:23.633
when we have one
who can move in now.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.800
The bottom line is, I cannot live
in that apartment due to COVID risks.

08:27.867 --> 08:29.500
The drug use in our apartment

08:29.567 --> 08:31.900
that I do not feel comfortable
being around.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.233
The Family Housing Act
does protect me from these issues.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.800
I wish Haley and you the best,
so please let me know.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.767
You find a solution
to the housemate this month.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.667
Thank you for the text,

08:43.734 --> 08:46.166
but let's be clear
about a few things first,

08:46.233 --> 08:47.900
after talking with the girls,

08:47.967 --> 08:51.000
they don't feel comfortable
living with a male,

08:51.066 --> 08:54.100
especially one that's five years older."

08:54.166 --> 08:56.800
Well, that's nothing. A male
that's five years older than you are

08:56.867 --> 08:59.400
is probably 10 years your junior.

08:59.467 --> 09:03.233
"Secondly, if you want
to sling insults about the girls,

09:03.300 --> 09:05.367
I'm sure your parents would love to hear

09:05.433 --> 09:07.767
all about the Tinder boys
and sugar daddies

09:07.834 --> 09:10.100
that you brought back to the apartment

09:10.166 --> 09:11.867
or that you and...

09:11.934 --> 09:14.467
are responsible for the alcohol
in the apartment.

09:14.533 --> 09:17.867
Mental health is serious and Haley
has called me almost every day

09:17.934 --> 09:21.133
super stressed about the roommate
situation since September.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.033
One of the roommates
getting COVID sucked.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.834
Haley had to come home too,
but that was in October.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.300
If you were so worried,
you should have let someone know.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.266
This is the first I'm hearing of this.

09:30.333 --> 09:34.367
I do agree on one thing
we need to have this resolved ASAP."

09:34.433 --> 09:36.166
So this is my question.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.667
After reading, I gather that

09:38.734 --> 09:42.233
you are claiming or claim to your mother

09:42.300 --> 09:45.967
that the defendant brought men
back to the apartment.

09:47.667 --> 09:48.667
- Yes.
- Yes.

09:48.734 --> 09:51.367
- How old?
- I was not there when it happened.

09:51.433 --> 09:52.734
My--when my other roommate...

09:52.800 --> 09:54.166
So then, you can't tell me about it.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.934
- [Haley] Can I...
- Then you can tell me about it,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.533
if you didn't see it
or discuss it with her.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.133
She came home because of COVID.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.567
- She stayed even though...
- [Judge Judy] I...

10:01.633 --> 10:03.500
...the other roommate
was positive in COVID.

10:03.567 --> 10:06.900
And so her excuse of not wanting
to leave because of COVID,

10:06.967 --> 10:09.500
she stayed there
with the other roommate.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.567
- [Judge Judy] Yeah, well...
- [Sophia] Well, I was...

10:10.633 --> 10:11.834
[Judge Judy] Just a second.

10:11.900 --> 10:15.300
Alcohol is not illegal.
Cocaine is illegal.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.066
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.433
- There just--shh--
- There were other people

10:18.500 --> 10:21.367
in the apartment also using.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.500
That doesn't make it better,
unless what you're telling me--

10:25.567 --> 10:27.767
that doesn't make it better, Haley.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.600
Unless what you're telling me is that--

10:30.667 --> 10:32.834
and I'm not sure I believe that

10:32.900 --> 10:35.233
with her condition that she was using.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.133
- No, I was not saying she was.
- Okay.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.934
That in and of itself
would be sufficient basis

10:41.000 --> 10:42.367
for her to leave the apartment.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.100
- Provided--
- You understand that Mr. Martinez?

10:44.166 --> 10:45.600
Provided it was true, yes.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.266
Your daughter just told me it was true.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.500
- No, she never...
- Shh, shh.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.567
No, no.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.800
- Your daughter just told me it was true.
- [Michael] I understand what she...

10:52.867 --> 10:58.834
Mr. Martinez, your daughter,
who was there, just told me it was true.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.500
She said other people were using too...

11:01.567 --> 11:03.100
- Yes, I understand...
- ...in the apartment.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.066
- I understand that.
- But not the defendant.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.500
That in and of itself,

11:07.567 --> 11:09.467
without anything else,

11:09.533 --> 11:11.500
would be reason enough for her to move.

11:11.567 --> 11:12.667
Do you understand that?

11:12.734 --> 11:17.033
Because if the police
raided that apartment,

11:17.100 --> 11:20.800
anyone in that apartment
would be arrested,

11:20.867 --> 11:25.867
not if they found Jack Daniel's
or Five Feathers or Three Tails,

11:25.934 --> 11:28.767
or whatever it is, but they would be
arrested for hard drugs.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.767
Your wife said,

11:31.834 --> 11:33.700
"Haley is not comfortable

11:33.767 --> 11:36.767
living with a male five years older."

11:36.834 --> 11:38.233
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.633
And what I said to you,
a 25-year-old male

11:40.700 --> 11:42.433
is like a 14-year-old.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
[announcer] <i>Later...</i>

11:43.567 --> 11:45.533
How did you come
into possession of his gun?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.700
I found the gun.

11:46.767 --> 11:47.800
Where did you find it?

11:47.867 --> 11:50.900
Inside the clippings bag
of his mother's lawnmower.

11:50.967 --> 11:52.166
He was hiding it from me
'cause he knew I want to--

11:52.233 --> 11:54.734
Just a second. What were you doing
looking at it there?

12:00.767 --> 12:03.000
[♪ dramatic music playing]

12:05.233 --> 12:07.734
[announcer] <i>Michael Martinez</i>
<i>and his 20-year-old daughter, Hayley,</i>

12:07.800 --> 12:11.333
<i>claim her former roommate,</i>
<i>20-year-old Sophia Violich,</i>

12:11.400 --> 12:14.500
<i>broke their lease</i>
<i>and owes for unpaid rent.</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:17.900
[Judge Judy] Okay. The second thing
that I don't understand is,

12:17.967 --> 12:19.633
if she says she's moving,

12:19.700 --> 12:22.867
and she says she's moving for a reason,
that is a legal reason,

12:22.934 --> 12:26.367
which is drug use, which your daughter
just acknowledged, Mr. Martinez.

12:26.433 --> 12:29.567
And she found another roommate

12:29.633 --> 12:32.500
to take over their lease, her lease.

12:32.567 --> 12:34.767
Did you interview those people?

12:34.834 --> 12:36.200
- They never--
- Dup dup!

12:36.266 --> 12:37.633
You're not on the lease.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.033
Did you interview those people?

12:40.100 --> 12:42.233
No, she never gave
the information to anybody.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.433
Well, no, she gave it to your wife.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.700
- Not the contact number...
- Okay. Just a second...

12:45.767 --> 12:48.133
- ...she just said she had people...
- No. Just--no, listen to me.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
[Michael] I'm listening.

12:49.266 --> 12:54.734
Your wife said, "Haley is not
comfortable living with a male

12:54.800 --> 12:57.133
five years older than she is."

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

12:58.867 --> 13:03.834
And what I said to you,
a 25-year-old male is like a 14-year-old.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.633
So I mean, I could understand it
if she brought in a man

13:07.700 --> 13:12.133
who was 65 living with a bunch
of young girls

13:12.200 --> 13:13.867
and said, "This is who I have."

13:13.934 --> 13:15.000
And, you know.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.667
So he's got a little history

13:16.734 --> 13:20.300
and he had to be relocated
from his last site.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.433
I could understand that.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.467
But this was a couple,
a young couple who they found.

13:25.533 --> 13:28.967
It's not that she didn't provide
their information.

13:29.033 --> 13:31.700
Your wife said,
"We're not interested in that

13:31.767 --> 13:33.567
because Haley is uncomfortable."

13:33.633 --> 13:35.667
So for those two reasons, sir,

13:35.734 --> 13:37.867
your case is dismissed against her.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.333
I would be curious to find out

13:40.400 --> 13:43.266
what happens with your case
against the other girl.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.734
I don't know what
the other girl's situation is

13:45.800 --> 13:48.266
with regard to the drug use

13:48.333 --> 13:51.000
if she was involved in that.

13:51.066 --> 13:54.367
Might be different,
but that in and of itself

13:54.433 --> 13:57.100
is sufficient basis for her to leave.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.166
And that's unfortunate.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.300
And for that, you should have
a discussion with your daughter.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.567
I've already talked to my daughter
about everything.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.300
Okay, good.
We're done here. Thank you.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.367
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.567
She's lying about
half the stuff she said.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.266
Haley was using lots of drugs.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.700
I didn't feel comfortable being around.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.533
I am a college student, I admit that,

14:13.600 --> 14:17.100
but to say I was doing it
every single weekend is absurd to me.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.600
Just a bunch of losers basically.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.867
He's a straight A student in a--
in a private college,

14:20.934 --> 14:22.367
and she's a great kid.

14:22.433 --> 14:25.433
Will not be sharing a room
with strangers.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.333
[Sarah] One thing I am hung up
a little on that case

14:29.400 --> 14:32.467
is the defendant who claimed
that she was nervous about COVID

14:32.533 --> 14:34.233
due to an underlying health condition--

14:34.300 --> 14:36.467
why return to a college town

14:36.533 --> 14:39.934
when school is not in session, in person?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
The only positive I see of that
is a social life.

14:43.066 --> 14:46.133
And if you're so cautious
and so nervous about catching COVID,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.133
I don't see any reason
why she even returned to her--

14:49.200 --> 14:50.467
an apartment with friends.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.500
Yeah, it's a solid point.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.300
However, what the law says is that

14:55.367 --> 14:59.600
if you are providing a situation

14:59.667 --> 15:02.767
where someone who was innocent
of any wrongdoing,

15:02.834 --> 15:04.900
in this situation, drugs and the...

15:04.967 --> 15:07.000
it's like having illegal guns
in an apartment.

15:07.066 --> 15:11.433
Everybody is presumed to be
in possession of an illegal drug.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.967
So, that in and of itself is a reason,

15:14.033 --> 15:16.500
legally, for her to extricate herself

15:16.567 --> 15:19.500
from a situation
where she could be arrested.

15:19.567 --> 15:23.100
And the second thing is
that being the case,

15:23.166 --> 15:25.667
you're supposed to try
to mitigate damages.

15:25.734 --> 15:28.166
They found another couple
to take over the room

15:28.233 --> 15:30.066
and take over their portion of the rent.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.166
The plaintiff
wouldn't even interview them.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.767
And clearly, Haley was comfortable
in a situation

15:34.834 --> 15:36.867
where she was living
in an apartment with illegal drugs

15:36.934 --> 15:39.834
at least to interview a guy who's 25.
You may like him.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.900
Anyway, legally,
she can't be held responsible.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.767
Case number 1012,
Norris versus Lathan, Bowman.

15:46.834 --> 15:47.900
Please step forward.

15:47.967 --> 15:51.967
[announcer] <i>Naomi Norris is suing</i>
<i>her ex-boyfriend, Joseph Bowman,</i>

15:52.033 --> 15:54.133
<i>and his current girlfriend,</i>
<i>Brooke Lathan,</i>

15:54.200 --> 15:56.233
<i>for damages to her car.</i>

15:56.300 --> 15:59.600
- This used to be your boyfriend.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.967
For how long
were the two of you involved?

16:02.033 --> 16:03.533
Just under 10 years.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.400
[Judge Judy] And when
did the two of you separate?

16:05.467 --> 16:07.400
Approximately February of this year.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.500
And how long have you been involved
with Mr. Bowman?

16:11.567 --> 16:13.133
Since about February this year.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.266
So about the same time.
You don't waste any time, sir.

16:16.367 --> 16:20.166
Ms. Norris, it is your claim
that the defendant, Ms. Lathan,

16:20.233 --> 16:21.567
damaged your property?

16:21.633 --> 16:24.133
- Yes, ma'am.
- And that property would be your car?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.367
- Yes, ma'am.
- The defendants say

16:26.433 --> 16:28.633
that nothing could be farther
from the truth,

16:28.700 --> 16:31.467
that you filed a false
restraining order against them,

16:31.533 --> 16:34.266
that you've been stalking
and harassing them,

16:34.333 --> 16:37.433
and that it was actually you
who were guilty

16:37.500 --> 16:39.066
of vandalizing their property.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.734
So tell me, Ms. Norris,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.734
on what date
did this incident take place?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.967
April 20th of this year.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.500
And I gather that the breakup
with Mr. Bowman

16:48.567 --> 16:50.066
was an acrimonious one.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.000
To say the least. Yeah.

16:53.066 --> 16:57.500
And I assume
not primarily of your choosing?

16:57.567 --> 16:58.800
- Correct.
- Okay.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.033
Tell me the time of this incident.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.867
The date was the 20th of April.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.900
It was after--
it was a little after midnight.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.166
Okay. Now, what I gather is,

17:07.233 --> 17:10.467
am I correct that he had some sort
of a lawsuit

17:10.533 --> 17:13.467
that you somehow were involved in?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.100
It's' a--it's a criminal case.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.600
- Who's the defendant in that case?
- He is.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.934
And that case has been pending
for a while?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.066
Over a year.

17:21.133 --> 17:24.266
So it was pending at the time
that you and Ms. Norris were together?

17:24.333 --> 17:25.400
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:25.467 --> 17:28.800
You've had the necessity
to talk to him about this case

17:28.867 --> 17:32.000
late at night, and he wasn't,
sort of, responding.

17:32.066 --> 17:34.600
You reached out to him somehow,
by text, by phone?

17:34.667 --> 17:36.433
- Text, emails, phone.
- Text, phone?

17:36.500 --> 17:37.834
- And he wasn't responding?
- Right.

17:37.900 --> 17:42.567
And now it's 11:00 at night,
and you tried to text him.

17:43.467 --> 17:46.300
You knew he was
with this lady, that was clear,

17:46.367 --> 17:48.900
and somehow you saw his car?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.934
- Right.
- So what did you do?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.500
Earlier in the day that he knew

17:52.567 --> 17:54.166
that I was wanting to speak
with him about this--

17:54.233 --> 17:55.734
- But he ignored you?
- Correct.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.233
Ms. Norris, you should've given up
the ghost by April.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.333
Well, I ended up
being subpoenaed for that case.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.767
It was so, kind of--I'm, kind of,
stuck with it for a bit.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.400
Well, meanwhile,
you saw his car parked in the street.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.567
You had tried to get in touch
with him that day,

18:07.633 --> 18:09.300
several times, and he ignored you.

18:09.367 --> 18:11.300
And what did you do?

18:11.367 --> 18:13.700
I turned in, park behind him,
right directly behind his truck.

18:13.767 --> 18:14.967
I didn't know whether he was
or wasn't in it...

18:15.033 --> 18:18.800
Just a second. You parked directly
behind his truck and...

18:18.867 --> 18:21.367
And either called or text.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.200
I assume you have the text with you?

18:24.266 --> 18:27.400
My battery--I didn't have a charger
with me today, so I don't...

18:27.467 --> 18:29.100
- Yeah, you--
- ...I don't have that available

18:29.166 --> 18:30.367
- at the moment.
- Okay.

18:30.433 --> 18:33.100
So far you're not batting
a thousand with me, Ms. Norris.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.867
Okay. What happened next?

18:34.934 --> 18:38.000
Ms. Lathan came out
of the house a few doors down,

18:38.066 --> 18:42.033
got in her vehicle, and came over
to where I was parked.

18:42.100 --> 18:47.133
It wasn't exactly a hit, but her vehicle
touched the side of my vehicle.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.100
She got out, jumped on my hood,

18:49.166 --> 18:51.900
and dented it and smashed
the windshield.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.300
You remember that evening?

18:53.367 --> 18:56.867
I wasn't even in Chico
when this supposedly happened.

18:56.934 --> 18:59.433
- Where were you?
- I was at my dad's cabin in Lake Eleanor.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
- Where was he?
- He was in Chico.

19:01.567 --> 19:02.867
Was he staying at your house?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.600
No, but he came by to grab
some stuff of mine,

19:05.667 --> 19:07.934
because I stay with him
at his mom's house in Chico.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.533
Did the police ever question you
about this incident?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.600
- No.
- Did you report it to the police?

19:12.667 --> 19:14.100
- Yes, ma'am.
- On what date?

19:14.166 --> 19:16.400
- On the 20th.
- I'd like to see the police report.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.834
Did you call the police while she was
jumping on the hood of your car?

19:29.900 --> 19:31.433
No, I did not.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.033
It was directly afterwards.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.367
[Judge Judy]
It was directly afterwards?

19:34.433 --> 19:35.967
- Yes.
- I'm just noting.

19:36.033 --> 19:39.000
In the police report, it says can hear

19:39.066 --> 19:40.900
a female yelling at someone,

19:40.967 --> 19:42.600
but it couldn't have been her

19:42.667 --> 19:44.567
because you didn't have
your phone on...

19:44.633 --> 19:45.700
- Right.
- ...at the time.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.166
So I'm just trying to figure out
who that is.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.734
That's me yelling at Mr. Bowman.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.400
So you're yelling at Mr. Bowman?

19:53.467 --> 19:54.633
Yes, he prevented...

19:54.700 --> 19:55.867
[Judge Judy] Shh.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.533
Did you move his car
at any time after February 2021?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.400
- Yes.
- What did you do that for?

20:03.467 --> 20:05.333
Because it was sitting
in the middle of the parking lot.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.700
It was not in a parking space.

20:06.767 --> 20:09.400
Well, what were you doing
touching his car after you broke up?

[Judge Judy] Okay.
Do you have photographs of the car?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.967
- [Naomi] Yes, ma'am.
- I'd like to see 'em.

20:35.033 --> 20:40.433
Um, these are my photos at the--

20:40.500 --> 20:42.166
Um, adjusters.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.333
How did she break
the windshield of your car?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.967
With her hands.

20:48.033 --> 20:49.533
Do you have an estimate
for the damage to the car?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.900
You had insurance? You had a...

20:50.967 --> 20:52.233
- Yes, ma'am.
- You had a deductible?

20:52.300 --> 20:54.467
Uh, yes. And that is...

20:54.533 --> 20:56.900
"I have a $2,500 deductible."

20:56.967 --> 20:59.433
I got it. I got it.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.233
Did you see her that evening?

21:01.300 --> 21:02.100
- No.
- [Judge Judy] No.

21:02.166 --> 21:05.200
This is all sort of figment
of her imagination.

21:05.266 --> 21:06.367
The truth of the matter is,

21:06.433 --> 21:10.100
nobody purposefully breaks
their windshield of their car.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.867
'Cause that puts it
out of commission.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.100
You have a counterclaim.

21:13.166 --> 21:15.867
Ms. Norris, were you arrested
for possession

21:15.934 --> 21:17.633
of Mr. Bowman's gun?

21:17.700 --> 21:18.700
Yes, ma'am.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.734
How did you come
into possession of his gun?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.967
In referencing the case,
he has a restraining order,

21:24.033 --> 21:26.100
a no-contact order from that case,

21:26.166 --> 21:28.467
which means that he's not allowed
to have the gun.

21:28.533 --> 21:29.600
I found the gun...

21:29.667 --> 21:30.667
Where did you find it?

21:30.734 --> 21:33.834
Inside the clippings bag
of his mother's lawnmower.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.500
Just a second, what were you doing
looking at it there?

21:36.567 --> 21:38.300
I was looking for it because he's not--

21:38.367 --> 21:41.100
he has been ordered to return--or to...

21:41.166 --> 21:42.767
You went to his mother's house?

21:42.834 --> 21:44.667
Well, yes, I was there all the time.

21:44.734 --> 21:45.734
- Like, I was still...
- Just a second.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.667
I was still involved
with them being over there.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.333
In what month did you find the gun?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
- What month?
- In April.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.233
Well, you had broken up with him.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.800
- Yes, but I was still--
- So what were you doing in that--

21:53.867 --> 21:54.867
in his mother's house?

21:54.934 --> 21:58.533
She was still allowing me
and my kids to come by, um...

21:58.600 --> 21:59.700
Well, that's ridiculous.

21:59.767 --> 22:01.800
And go--to go through
the lawn clipping bag...

22:01.867 --> 22:06.934
Did you move his car
at any time after February 2021?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.166
- Yes.
- Where did you move it from?

22:09.233 --> 22:12.400
Uh, the middle of the parking lot
at a Walgreens.

22:12.467 --> 22:15.266
It was not in a parking space,
it was in the parking lot.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.233
And where did you move his car to?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.633
Our storage unit.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.767
What did you do that for?

22:19.834 --> 22:22.400
Um, because it was sitting
in the middle of the parking lot.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.834
It was not in a parking space.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.100
- Just a second. Is that his car?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.667
Well, what were you doing touching
his car after you broke up?

22:29.734 --> 22:31.767
I had told him
and informed him earlier that day

22:31.834 --> 22:32.934
that I have been moving--

22:33.000 --> 22:36.300
I moved his vehicle because it was
in the middle of the parking lot.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.667
Yeah, you have to stay away from him.

22:37.734 --> 22:40.300
Well, that is--that makes sense. Yes.

22:40.367 --> 22:41.667
You have to stay away from him.

22:41.734 --> 22:44.000
Did you file a restraining order
against him?

22:44.066 --> 22:45.700
Not against him, no.

22:45.767 --> 22:48.000
- Against whom?
- Uh, Ms. Lathan.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.433
- Was it dismissed?
- Yes, it was.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.567
Did you have a trial?

22:51.633 --> 22:53.333
We did have a court date.
I was late, so...

22:53.400 --> 22:54.967
So the answer is,

22:55.033 --> 22:57.400
you filed for a restraining order
and didn't show up?

22:57.467 --> 23:00.333
So it was dismissed for not--
your non-appearance.

23:00.400 --> 23:05.166
Did you in fact take control
of his password

23:05.233 --> 23:08.266
and lock him out
of his email accounts at any time?

23:08.333 --> 23:10.667
It was the business account
that my name is attached to.

23:10.734 --> 23:13.967
In what month did you lock him out
of the business account?

23:14.033 --> 23:16.834
It was the end of, uh, February.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.800
Did you advise him
that you were locking him out?

23:18.867 --> 23:19.867
- Yes.
- Of his--

23:19.934 --> 23:21.767
And then within a week,
he had all the information

23:21.834 --> 23:23.333
to get back into that account.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.066
- Okay.
- Can I say something real quick, too,

23:25.133 --> 23:28.066
about all the other things
that we've been talking about?

23:28.133 --> 23:29.867
You asked, like, why would
someone break someone's--

23:29.934 --> 23:30.934
their own windshield?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.266
Why would someone
steal someone's truck,

23:32.333 --> 23:33.500
have it towed to a storage unit,

23:33.567 --> 23:35.000
change the lock so he can't get it to it,

23:35.066 --> 23:36.934
write all over the truck,
pee in his truck--

23:37.000 --> 23:39.734
- Just a second. Did that happen?
- No.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.800
- Ms. Norris?
- No.

23:40.867 --> 23:41.934
- It did not?
- Not. No, it did not.

23:42.033 --> 23:44.667
Did you--
did you in fact urinate in his truck?

23:44.734 --> 23:45.767
- No, I did not.
- At the time?

23:45.834 --> 23:47.367
Okay. Do you have any proof of that?

23:47.433 --> 23:48.900
- Yes, we do.
- I'd like to see it.

23:48.967 --> 23:50.934
Here's a receipt for my new seats.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.266
- Okay.
- Um...

23:57.066 --> 23:58.633
So you replaced the seats?

23:58.700 --> 24:00.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.567
Ms. Norris?
You gotta get over it.

24:02.633 --> 24:03.900
- Oh, I am.
- Do you understand?

24:03.967 --> 24:05.433
- Oh, I am.
- You gotta get over it.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.600
Have you had
any difficulty with her since?

24:07.667 --> 24:09.033
- No, Your Honor.
- Ms. Norris...

24:09.100 --> 24:11.133
I'm dismissing your claim on the car.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.500
- And--
- I actually have physical proof of her--

24:13.567 --> 24:15.433
these are her shoeprints on there.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.700
I don't think so.

24:16.767 --> 24:19.166
Because, um,
you're taking your own words.

24:19.233 --> 24:21.266
You, after the breakup,

24:21.333 --> 24:24.967
after he and Ms. Lathan were involved,

24:25.033 --> 24:28.200
moved his truck without his permission,

24:28.266 --> 24:31.867
and without notifying him at all,

24:31.934 --> 24:34.433
and if you did at all until later...

24:34.500 --> 24:35.867
- I did not...
- ...number one.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.333
Number two,

24:37.400 --> 24:40.000
you did purposefully,
you locked him out

24:40.066 --> 24:42.734
of his own business
without forewarning him.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.500
I'm using your words.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.233
- Yes, I also, it's a partnership.
- Now I'm taking their word

24:47.300 --> 24:50.400
for the fact then when you
in fact moved his truck

24:50.467 --> 24:52.433
from one place to another,

24:52.500 --> 24:56.233
you urinated on the seats of that car.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.200
I'm taking their word for that.

24:58.266 --> 25:01.000
- No, I did not...
- You moved his truck to harass him.

25:01.066 --> 25:04.100
You cut him out of his own email,
business account,

25:04.166 --> 25:05.667
to harass him.

25:05.734 --> 25:07.100
According to you,

25:07.166 --> 25:10.033
you serendipitously
wanted to speak to him.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.834
He tried to ignore you.

25:11.900 --> 25:15.300
You went purposefully to find his car,

25:15.367 --> 25:17.367
11:00, 12:00 at night.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.433
Ms. Norris, what I'm saying to you is

25:19.500 --> 25:22.100
I think that you took
the breakup very hard--

25:22.166 --> 25:24.400
understandably, it was 10 years.

25:24.467 --> 25:28.066
But your behavior from your own mouth,
suggests to me

25:28.133 --> 25:32.600
that they wanted to be left alone,
and you couldn't leave them alone.

25:32.667 --> 25:35.233
So I'm awarding them $2,500
on the account, your suit--

25:35.300 --> 25:36.300
your petition is dismissed.

25:36.367 --> 25:37.367
Thank you. We're done.

25:37.433 --> 25:38.967
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- [Kevin] Court adjourned.

25:40.233 --> 25:42.767
I was being accused of things I didn't do,
and I'm glad she saw the truth.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.400
- I did not press criminal charges.
- All the drama stops.

25:45.467 --> 25:49.734
I am not responding or acknowledging
those text messages. It's not my problem.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.333
I'm just hoping that she calms down
now, realizes, like,

25:52.400 --> 25:53.867
stuff's done and she needs to move on.

25:53.934 --> 25:56.800
I have found peace and moved on,
and I will probably pursue

25:56.867 --> 25:59.166
the rest of my legal bounds with this.

26:00.066 --> 26:02.166
[Sarah] Sometimes after a few
of these cases,

26:02.233 --> 26:03.867
I'm just at a loss for words.

26:03.934 --> 26:07.467
Well, hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

26:07.533 --> 26:10.667
- That's true.
- And sometimes women...

26:10.734 --> 26:13.300
in my experience,
more often than men,

26:13.367 --> 26:16.734
the ones that I've seen,
take these breakups really hard.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.567
I mean, she had
a 10-year investment in this guy,

26:19.633 --> 26:20.900
and then he meets somebody else.

26:20.967 --> 26:23.367
Clearly, she wasn't ready to let it go

26:23.433 --> 26:27.266
without at least leaving her imprint
on their behinds.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.266
Sad. It's sad.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.133
If it's over, it's over.
Just have to accept it.
