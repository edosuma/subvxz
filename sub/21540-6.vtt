00:08.441 --> 00:10.176

a highway overpass to me.

- No way!

00:18.585 --> 00:21.254
- I did it!

00:31.431 --> 00:33.566
- Welcome to 111 Murray.
- Wow.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.636
- Schedule A price, $13,750,000.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.438
- My client authorized me
to go up to 13.5.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.040
- The sooner they start
selling units,

00:40.073 --> 00:41.041
prices will go up.
- No way,

00:41.074 --> 00:42.442
my client wants to stay at 13.5.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.277

- Yeah, my clients given me
the access to go up to 13.5.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.251
- Unfortunately,
the owners rejected the offer,

01:58.284 --> 02:00.920
and before we could even
come back at Schedule A,

02:00.954 --> 02:03.356
they have already
increased the price by 5%.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.657
- [sighs]
He's prepared to go up

02:04.691 --> 02:05.759
to Schedule A pricing.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.060
- I cannot go back
to Schedule A.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.595
I even tried--
- Luis, you can do this.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.063
Make it happen.

02:10.096 --> 02:13.700

to Howard Lorber

02:13.733 --> 02:16.069
and ask him
for yet another favor.

02:16.102 --> 02:20.173
Can we get the same price
that we once rejected.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.876
The problem is that
he wanted me to negotiate.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.177
I explained to him that,

02:24.210 --> 02:25.945
you know, it's not a building
that will negotiate.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.614
- Did you really tell him?
- I did tell him,

02:27.647 --> 02:29.349
but he was stubborn,
and he, like--

02:29.382 --> 02:32.318
- No, but did you
make it clear to him?

02:32.352 --> 02:35.722
- Well, maybe I make it clear,
but I wasn't too...

02:35.755 --> 02:37.924
- Forceful?
- Yes.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.526
- You really have to
think this stuff out.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.895
There's no way that
the developer is going

02:41.928 --> 02:44.631
to discount one of
the first units he sells.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.332
The--it's--there's no need
to do it.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.435
It doesn't make any sense.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.203
- You're right.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.106
<i>One thing I'm learning</i>
<i>about all this is that</i>

02:53.106 --> 02:56.276
you have to be accountable
for your own mistakes.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.213
Not blame anybody else,
but yourself.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.848

to hear that, but,

- Yeah, but listen, its--

03:03.249 --> 03:04.684
it's what it is.
- Okay, fine.

- What do you suggest?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.291

a great buyer to be considered

03:11.324 --> 03:12.726
to buying at Schedule A pricing.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.161
- Honestly,
I don't set the prices.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.264
You know, the pricing is set
by--generally by--by Steve.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.334
I could call him.
I could talk to him,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.470
but you're gonna have to

03:23.503 --> 03:25.505
sit down with him and sell him.

I think it's 50/50,
to be honest with you,

03:43.123 --> 03:44.958
that he does it.
- Okay.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.626
Well, thank you for that.
Thank you.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.995

04:45.518 --> 04:47.520
- I did a lot of favors for him.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.992
- And in the process,
he promised me

04:53.093 --> 04:56.096
that he would let me pitch
the place he is moving out of.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.698

and I'd like to create a record

08:20.633 --> 08:23.036
that is gonna be pretty tough
to beat for a long time.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.170
- Wait, break records as in,

08:24.204 --> 08:25.605
like, the most expensive
ever sold?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.107
- Dollars per square foot.
- You know that--you know that

08:27.140 --> 08:30.410
NoHo, last year,
was the neighborhood

08:30.443 --> 08:32.178
that appreciated the most.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.347
- Okay, so we're gonna take that
to a whole nother level,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.850
and that's why you're here,
Fredrik.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.351
- What's the price?
What're you saying?

08:38.385 --> 08:41.488
- Well, I'm looking for $3,000
a square foot here.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.922
We know what you did
with Bleecker,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.424
and, uh, we're impressed,

08:44.457 --> 08:46.726
but I think we're ready
to take it to another level.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.429
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

Our product is so special that--

09:07.347 --> 09:08.748
- No offense,
it's a hole in the ground.

You're buying into the future.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.587
Listen, we can maybe raise
prices slowly as we go,

09:14.621 --> 09:17.190
but, you know,
we have to get started

09:17.223 --> 09:20.593
at 2,850.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.029
- If we start too low,
we're gonna average too low.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.665
- Start too low?
2,850 is, in fact, a record.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.867
The old record was 2,825.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.704
We can get to where you want to,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.707
but we have to do it
a little bit slower.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.847
- Let's get,
uh--let's get it done.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.649
2,850 starting.
- Starting.

09:42.682 --> 09:46.052
- Dan wants record prices,
so I need to go big.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.488
And I mean,
like, outrageously big.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.159
Hmm.
Me.

- We need to start marketing

09:56.396 --> 09:57.530
The Jade and the Penthouse.
- Okay.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.531
- And we need to have
an open house,

09:58.565 --> 09:59.566
and we need to do something, no?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.867
- I have somebody shopping.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.652

10:19.686 --> 10:22.222
- This is done just as well
in terms of finishes

10:22.255 --> 10:24.524
as the new development,
so I'm thinking we can get

10:24.557 --> 10:26.826
at least 4,000 a square foot,

10:26.860 --> 10:29.496
so about 16.

10:29.529 --> 10:32.198
- Ryan?
- Uh, right.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.367
Um...
- What's the issue?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.404
- So, based on the comps
that I've seen,

10:37.437 --> 10:40.707
and maybe
my computer is different,

10:40.740 --> 10:42.976
I think somewhere around 12.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.444
- It's not gonna happen.

here doing price reductions

- Ryan, Ryan,

10:49.349 --> 10:50.850

- I've been in the business
14 years.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.322
I'm happy to have
a private conversation with you.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.925
- A private conversation
with you sounds wonderful to me.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.894
I don't know if we necessarily
need to do that

11:00.927 --> 11:02.962
because Sharif is the boss here.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.464
- 100%...
- You're gonna sell this.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.366
- But we just--
we're not listing at 12.

- And if you don't want to list

11:09.803 --> 11:11.971
with me, you don't have to,
but if we list it too high

11:12.072 --> 11:13.773
we're not gonna sell it.
- Ryan, the number has to be

11:13.807 --> 11:16.076

of what we're suggesting...

<i>- The worst thing you can do is</i>
<i>argue in front of a client,</i>

to Sharif

11:21.514 --> 11:23.483
that I actually care
about his money.

a couple of these...

- I can put these images

15:36.403 --> 15:38.405
into the actual renderings
of the building,

15:40.974 --> 15:44.210
these images hanging on the wall
inside those renderings.

15:44.244 --> 15:48.081
If we can give the building
a truthful and authentic brand

- No, I don't like that idea.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.632
- Right.
What about getting all, like,

17:12.665 --> 17:14.834
the top people of industry,

17:14.868 --> 17:16.503
and we invite them to the space

17:16.536 --> 17:18.605
and we make it
this magical unveiling,

17:18.638 --> 17:20.373

networking event for people too.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.276
- No, I don't--
I don't like that idea.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.945
- I get that Amy doesn't want me
on this listing,

17:26.046 --> 17:28.515
and maybe that's why she's being
a little,

17:28.548 --> 17:29.783
uh, difficult.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.452
Or we could do,
like, a top chefs event.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.888
- No.
- But at the same time,

17:34.921 --> 17:37.724
I mean, she should
kind of be honored

17:37.757 --> 17:40.060
to get to work with me,

17:40.093 --> 17:42.462

17:47.567 --> 17:48.835

17:48.868 --> 17:50.737
- I have one idea...
- Okay.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.206
- And I want to invite top CEOs

17:53.239 --> 17:57.077

estate companies in the U.S.,

17:57.077 --> 17:58.678

17:58.712 --> 18:00.547
the number one place to be
in New York.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.615
- So that's kind of like my top

18:02.649 --> 18:04.784
industry leader idea
that I just said, no?

18:04.818 --> 18:06.653

that was real estate specific...

18:06.686 --> 18:09.756

- But, um, sure.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.558

the artwork

18:46.526 --> 18:48.428

- Absolutely, let's do it.

20:09.743 --> 20:12.779
- The wig maker alone

<i>We've shown it</i>

The--the offer
below Schedule A was a mistake,

26:44.904 --> 26:45.972

26:46.072 --> 26:47.073
I probably should have had
more conviction

26:47.073 --> 26:49.142

he was making a mistake,

26:49.175 --> 26:50.810

26:50.844 --> 26:54.114

obviously,

26:54.147 --> 26:56.449

like any other buyer.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.020
They want to negotiate
because they feel that--

27:00.020 --> 27:02.022
- There's not that
many partnerships that price

27:02.055 --> 27:04.391
as fairly as we do.
- But, I-I don't--

27:04.424 --> 27:06.226
- And Howard,
it--it is a good strategy.

27:06.259 --> 27:09.062
Tell us how great our project is

27:09.095 --> 27:10.663

He's not gonna come up.

it's not even about money,

- What do you mean,

27:27.781 --> 27:29.249
"It's not about money"?
If it wasn't about money,

27:29.282 --> 27:31.117

You're right, Howard,
this is about money,

27:45.065 --> 27:46.499

"very legitimate buyer"?

And then there's a lot
of other friends of his

27:57.210 --> 27:59.479

after he end up buying,

27:59.512 --> 28:00.914

28:01.014 --> 28:02.148
you're leaving money
on the table.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.416
Not just because of this deal,

28:03.450 --> 28:05.785
but because of all
the other deals that you develop

28:05.819 --> 28:07.354

I put a empty chair next to me

How are you?

- Good.
- So did you hear

36:59.486 --> 37:00.887
about the party yet?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.922
- Heard all about it.
- What did you hear?

37:03.023 --> 37:04.858
- Well, there was about
500 people there, which was--

37:04.891 --> 37:06.559
- It was 572
according to clicker.

37:06.593 --> 37:09.062

37:35.321 --> 37:37.757
- This is insane!

37:37.791 --> 37:38.858
Whee!

37:38.892 --> 37:41.394
To sell four units
at the actual party

37:41.428 --> 37:43.763
is insanity in a good way.

37:43.797 --> 37:45.632
- The only thing I can say is,

37:45.665 --> 37:48.301
you and I both know we sold them
way below market value.

37:48.335 --> 37:49.602
Right?
- Below market?

37:49.636 --> 37:51.471
That was a record.
- We created something

in this city before.

- Now?
- It's gotta happen now.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.782
- We're gonna be able
to raise those units.

38:02.816 --> 38:05.285
We just need to get to 50% sold

38:05.318 --> 38:07.320

is coming.

It's too early.
We just--I mean, I--

38:08.655 --> 38:11.491
the party was two nights ago.
- It's $200,000

38:11.524 --> 38:13.126
on a $4 million apartment.

38:13.159 --> 38:15.028
These things are flying
off the shelf like hotcakes.

38:15.028 --> 38:16.663
We gotta stop.
It's going too fast.

38:16.696 --> 38:19.466
- They're flying off the shelf
because Andy Warhol and I--

38:19.499 --> 38:21.634
- They're flying off the shelf
because they're too cheap.

38:21.668 --> 38:24.037
- Developers and sellers,
they always say that.

38:24.037 --> 38:25.538
"It just sells itself."
"Flies off the shel--"

38:25.572 --> 38:26.539
It doesn't.

an average sales person,

and you're not gonna

- They're too cheap.
- They're not too cheap.

38:47.427 --> 38:49.062
We're going up 5%
across the board.

- What?

38:50.263 --> 38:51.531
- Now is the time.

38:51.564 --> 38:54.134

and raised the prices

38:55.969 --> 38:57.604
- What, I gotta check with you?
- Dan, I'm here.

38:57.637 --> 38:58.905
- You hired me.

38:58.938 --> 39:00.306
You're supposed to consult
with me, and I--

39:00.340 --> 39:01.641
- What,
I gotta ask you permission

and when now?

39:03.009 --> 39:04.377
- No, we--you could
at least consult me.

- You don't have to ask

39:05.679 --> 39:07.180

39:23.797 --> 39:26.166
I was announcing
different price points

39:26.199 --> 39:27.200
