WEBVTT

01:46.106 --> 01:47.149
What?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.212
Come on, then.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.923
Clear!

02:53.006 --> 02:54.633
See if she's in here.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.012
All right, come on. You're nearly there.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.975
Go on, then. Open it.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.987
-Right.
-Right.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.159
So, this is the princess.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.911
All pure for her wedding.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.831
I haven't been close
to the princess before.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.584
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.630
No, don't.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.883
If you wake her up,
I'm gonna break your face.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.968
Yeah, yeah.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.684
Oh, here we go.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.732
Got a little fight in you, eh?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.025
Just get her back to bed.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.070
-What's she doing?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.680
-Grab her.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.392
Whoa.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.060
Come on.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.563
Yeah!

04:32.606 --> 04:35.025
You're gonna get married, like it or not.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.989
Stop messing around.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.283
Get her back in bed.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.386
All right.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.680
Fun's over.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.766
Get back here!

05:13.146 --> 05:14.564
Come here, you little bitch.

05:29.913 --> 05:30.997
I've got you now.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.181
You think you're gonna make it
all the way to the bottom?

06:32.684 --> 06:33.935
I'll see you there.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.826
Might be in here.
Looks like she might be in here.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.038
-I can hear something.
-No.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.290
What's going on in there?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.477
All right! This way!

08:39.060 --> 08:40.895
-Get moving!

08:40.979 --> 08:42.272
On your knees.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.399
Close those doors!

08:44.899 --> 08:47.068
-Quiet. On the floor.
-Lock everything down.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.153
Shut up.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.780
-Get this off the floor.
-Sit!

08:52.991 --> 08:54.701
Get that lock in place!

08:55.326 --> 08:57.495
Come on! Close the door.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.664
No one gets in or out!

09:00.874 --> 09:01.958
-Quickly!
-Move!

09:02.042 --> 09:03.418
Lock it down!

09:03.501 --> 09:04.919
What are you looking at?

09:05.587 --> 09:07.422
-Come on! Move it!
-On the floor.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.674
Castle is secure, sir.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.509
Get down, now!

09:12.010 --> 09:13.928
Told ya, move! Come along!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.483
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
I don't believe that for a moment.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.571
Julius, if your father could see--

09:31.654 --> 09:32.655
My father?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.949
My father?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.035
Your father was a diplomat.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.829
You two were cut from the same cloth.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.457
Weak.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.167
Pathetic.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.878
-Pacifiers, placaters.
-We trusted you.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.588
You talk to me about trust?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.381
You can't have my sister.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.260
Well, my little princess,

09:54.761 --> 09:59.682
I will marry your sister
because I always get what I want.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.944
Listen and obey.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.155
Like a child should.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.495
Now, now.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.916
We shouldn't be surprised
that this so-called king

10:26.292 --> 10:28.419
abides the bad behavior of his daughters.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.091
You have no respect
for the order of things.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.301
You have trampled
our cherished traditions.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.303
You have welcomed outsiders.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.598
A true king should've conquered them.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.270
You have made us look vulnerable
in the eyes of our enemy.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.731
Julius, listen to me.
No one can rule by fear for long.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.193
The people are not cattle.
They will not follow you blindly.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.653
Oh, "the people."

10:55.155 --> 10:58.366
People don't know what they want
until they see it.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.828
Strength on the throne,
that is what "the people" crave.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.707
Today, they shall have it.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.003
As you were.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.672
You, get them. Move!

11:12.755 --> 11:15.550
-All right, come.
-Come on! Get on your feet.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.843
-Come on. Get up.
-Come on.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.388
-Chop-chop. Come on.
-Come on, move! Move it!

11:21.055 --> 11:22.932
This is all my fault.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.698
You are old enough now to understand.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.367
This kingdom, it has no heir.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.370
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

11:56.549 --> 12:01.888
I am so honored
that you have chosen me as your son.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.767
And to be given the vast responsibility

12:05.850 --> 12:07.936
of becoming the true leader
of this kingdom.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.071
I'd like to offer you this small token.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.122
I…

12:30.500 --> 12:31.668
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.693
Hang on. I gotta take a piss.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.800
Oh, yeah.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.847
Mm-hmm.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.906
Huh?

13:44.866 --> 13:46.242
Well, what do we have here?

13:48.786 --> 13:51.539
Yeah, looking good.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.296
Oh, yeah.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.141
All right, then.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.480
Where are you at? Get in here, now.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.407
-Oi, get that door now! Move!
-Go!

15:07.490 --> 15:09.492
Get a bag to put it in!

15:09.575 --> 15:11.869
-Search every room!

15:16.332 --> 15:17.875
Oi, come over here.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.547
Plenty of bounty in here, boys.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.550
Come on! This way!

15:27.552 --> 15:29.429
Pick it up. Come on. Pick it up.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.391
Hurry up!

15:33.474 --> 15:36.227
The hallway's secure.
Move up to the next floor.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.948
You should be locked up
with the others.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.259
Oh, damn. Well, that usually works.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.826
Someone needs to teach you your place.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.621
I've heard that before.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.924
Get off me!

18:04.333 --> 18:07.670
I want to be a great warrior.
Like you were, Linh.

18:07.753 --> 18:12.300
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights…

18:12.383 --> 18:14.343
Through calm, find your center.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.346
…but by what she is fighting for.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.434
What on earth are you two doing?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.686
Your Majesty.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.813
You're supposed to be learning etiquette.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.065
Listen,

18:28.649 --> 18:31.777
with any luck, soon I will
give the kingdom the son it needs.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.904
But your education and your training

18:33.988 --> 18:36.824
are no less crucial
to our family's future.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.786
If I might, Your Majesty.
She is a very smart girl.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.788
She can learn many things at once.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.043
In future,
keep it out of view of the palace.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.919
The king will not approve.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.161
He washed up over there.
He must have fallen from the tower.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.247
Fallen?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.919
Look at the bruises. They tell the story.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.422
This man didn't fall.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.759
Everything else is proceeding
just as my lord planned.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.427
The tower is ours.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.514
The princess is dressed
and ready for the wedding.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.766
Has someone checked
that she's safe and secure?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.726
She's locked in. Chained.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.228
Is that what I asked, Kurr?

19:49.939 --> 19:54.151
If there is some vigilante on the loose,
you take care of it.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.155
Otherwise,
your position is in serious jeopardy.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.407
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.950
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir!

20:02.368 --> 20:03.369
Good.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.423
You. Come here!

20:20.344 --> 20:23.139
To the top of the tower.
Check on the princess.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.396
Yes. Up there. Go!

20:35.276 --> 20:36.277
Warm in here.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.320
-Gold. Look.
-Where?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.030
-Women.
-Women's gold?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.115
No.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.737
-What are you doing now?
-What's that? Quickly!

21:19.820 --> 21:21.697
You two, search those doors.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.533
-You, with me.
-Come on, then, boy, let's go.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.619
Come on. Hurry up. Through here.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.665
Come on. Must be some bounty in here.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.214
I can't believe she stabbed me!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.302
Oh, I like a girl in lace.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.825
-What has Julius done with my family?
-Fuck off.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.369
Do you even know how to use this thing?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.209
Watch your language.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.503
You're in the presence of a princess.

22:19.463 --> 22:22.216
-Where are they?
-I'm not telling you anything, you bitch.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.349
Don't make me ask again.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.769
You're never getting out of here alive,
you cu--

22:37.982 --> 22:39.859
I warned you about that mouth.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.878
-Ooh, nice.
-Thank you very much.

22:58.961 --> 23:01.380
There's plenty more in here!

23:01.463 --> 23:03.549
Let's take it all, boys!

23:06.135 --> 23:08.053
-Move!
-Out of the way, you big tub of lard.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.055
Come on, then. Go through here.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.891
-I like the look of that!

23:11.974 --> 23:13.100
Get your hands off!

23:13.183 --> 23:15.394
-Let's go!
-I'm coming!

24:05.527 --> 24:06.695
Come on.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.990
Oh, God. Hurry up.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.904
-Search!
-Come on! Quickly!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.781
No bag to put it in.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.742
-Hey, what you doin' over there?
-What?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.285
The order is to search this way.

24:55.369 --> 24:56.578
Oh, yeah, all right.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.581
Come on! Go! Look everywhere.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.423
Anything that's shiny.
Anything we can sell down the village.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.926
Look, look, look. That, there.
Nice. Nice. Anything like that.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.988
-Get your hands off!

25:41.915 --> 25:43.751
We'll be rich with all this.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.130
-Come on!
-That's mine!

25:48.213 --> 25:50.924
-No, give it to me!
-Come on, boys.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.137
-Give me that!
-Get off it.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.849
All right, all right. Calm down.
Load it up now, boy.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.727
Hang on. Who put this clown in charge?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.023
-Give me some of that.
-No.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.858
I want it. Give me some of that.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.652
No, not again.
This happens every time. No.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.992
Come on, then.
Where's this food? I'm hungry.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.244
We've got some wine. What do you reckon?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.247
Yeah. Look at the pearls on that.
Bet that's worth…

26:22.331 --> 26:23.874
-There you go. Share it.
-Yeah.

26:23.957 --> 26:24.958
No, that's mine.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.877
Hey, Gibsy, what you got there, then?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.421
-Don't hog all of it, you fat bastard.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.466
This meat is mine.
You wanna eat? Get your own food.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.888
Move quickly then, boys.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.890
Julius can't get wind of this.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.850
Come on. Chop-chop.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.396
Sh-- All right. Whatever you got.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.481
-Yeah.
-Come on.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.234
-What's all that rubbish you got?
-Just shut up. Come on.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.152
-What?
-Keep your voice down.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.582
Where's your center? Hmm?

27:50.711 --> 27:53.130
No focus, no speed. Again.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.304
What did I tell you?

28:02.598 --> 28:04.474
You're not fighting from your heart.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.684
Try it again.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.775
What is he doing here?

28:13.859 --> 28:16.486
You know Khai
as one of the king's advisers.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.322
He's also my uncle

28:19.072 --> 28:21.909
and the warrior who trained me
once upon a time.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.958
Today, you're gonna fight us both.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.085
Both?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.151
You're not fighting from your heart.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.527
No focus, no speed.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.363
Patience and focus.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.260
You were right.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.470
She has a warrior's heart.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.641
I cannot accept such a gift.

29:28.433 --> 29:32.396
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

29:44.157 --> 29:48.245
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.522
How are the preparations
for the wedding coming?

30:15.605 --> 30:16.815
Good, sir.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.442
Is everything exactly as it was?

30:18.525 --> 30:22.446
The flowers, candles, ribbons?
The priests?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.531
Is everything as it was that evening?

30:25.115 --> 30:26.616
We'll get it done, sir.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.789
…grateful salutes…

30:35.542 --> 30:37.002
of my new subjects…

30:39.796 --> 30:43.717
we can finally purge this kingdom
of its weakness.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.766
Then why not take the throne by force?

30:52.476 --> 30:54.936
You can get what you want without her.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.191
You're a valued consort of mine,

31:00.859 --> 31:01.943
but politics?

31:03.028 --> 31:04.112
Please.

31:07.282 --> 31:10.243
There's a reason
why traditions last centuries.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.746
People love tradition.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.753
With her hand in mine,

31:19.836 --> 31:22.923
there is not a soul that can question
that I'm the rightful king!

31:23.632 --> 31:27.469
I only meant that last night
was a spectacular show of power.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.970
-Yes.
-Mmm.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.765
-They were terrified, weren't they?

31:31.848 --> 31:34.935
So… indignant.

31:35.477 --> 31:38.271
Violence wakes people up.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.070
And people will be even more terrified

31:45.153 --> 31:48.990
after the coronation
when I slit the king's throat.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.328
You are such a clever man.

31:55.997 --> 31:59.501
I know you need to save your strength
for that limp rag of a bride.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.130
Yes?

32:46.798 --> 32:47.966
What is it?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.010
I'm sorry, sir.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.512
-The king is asking for you.
-Oh, the king?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.306
The "king."

32:57.767 --> 32:59.186
Well, this will be interesting.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.895
Juli… …us,

33:42.604 --> 33:44.689
is the pri-- the prince--

33:47.025 --> 33:49.069
Is she th--

33:52.197 --> 33:53.281
She--

34:36.825 --> 34:38.493
You seek the crown.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.539
It can only hurt you in the eyes
of the very people you wish to rule.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.000
And how do you think you stand
in the eyes of the people now?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.668
Julius, this assault…

34:46.751 --> 34:48.753
You made a promise to me.

34:49.379 --> 34:52.090
A promise you recanted
on the whim of a girl.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.984
Who else do you take orders from?

35:53.568 --> 35:54.944
Servants?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.072
Dogs?

36:00.617 --> 36:02.869
Who exactly holds the power
in this kingdom?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.775
We both do. You and I.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.695
Julius,
let us find the solution to this together.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.447
Treason will only lead to more bloodshed.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.161
A wedding is not an act of treason.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.374
Take him away.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.861
Huh?

37:28.204 --> 37:29.497
The princess?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.124
She's in the tower.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.459
Are you sure?

37:33.918 --> 37:37.797
-Bloody hell. What's going on?
-Bloody hell did he come from?

37:51.978 --> 37:55.398
Deal with this now.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.663
Clear the tower again.

38:11.164 --> 38:14.083
Take it floor by floor.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.960
-Move! Let's go!
-Go! Come on! Move it!

38:16.044 --> 38:17.045
Wait!

38:18.004 --> 38:19.088
You.

38:19.923 --> 38:23.218
Hey. We heard what he has to say.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.722
You saw no sign of this man
on your way up or down?

38:27.806 --> 38:28.932
No.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.685
We're dealing with someone
who knows this place well.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.270
The lord's left.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.316
No one has to pretend
to listen to you now.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.610
Useless harlot.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.021
Not so useless now, am I?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.992
I want this vigilante killed.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.910
Consider no chamber clear.

39:31.536 --> 39:32.620
Go!

39:50.221 --> 39:51.764
Look, she's down there!

39:55.602 --> 39:57.270
Don't you move, girl!

40:00.106 --> 40:01.858
Come on! Hurry up!

40:08.406 --> 40:09.741
Where you going, huh?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.301
You're coming with us.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.475
Get after her!

40:36.935 --> 40:37.936
Let's get her, boys!

40:39.729 --> 40:40.813
Get back here!

40:50.573 --> 40:51.699
Get off me!

40:56.621 --> 40:57.747
Oh, God.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.801
Come on, boys!

41:12.387 --> 41:14.889
We've got you now, girl.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.463
Come on! Get up. Get her!

42:10.486 --> 42:11.487
My leg!

42:28.129 --> 42:29.255
Come here, you--

42:33.134 --> 42:34.302
Get up!

42:54.947 --> 42:56.157
Go on, get her!

43:03.664 --> 43:04.707
Come on!

43:27.063 --> 43:30.149
-No.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.584
Come on! Catch her!

43:50.628 --> 43:52.672
My leg!

43:52.755 --> 43:54.590
Stand back! We need her alive!

43:54.674 --> 43:56.509
Get me down from here!

43:57.802 --> 43:59.929
You! You! You let me go!

44:00.012 --> 44:00.930
Shut up!

44:03.641 --> 44:05.184
She's off her nut!

45:38.110 --> 45:39.111
Oh, you--

46:00.591 --> 46:03.386
Come on! Don't let her escape!

46:08.307 --> 46:09.517
Quickly!

46:10.434 --> 46:11.852
You're surrounded!

46:12.728 --> 46:14.105
Come on!

46:28.035 --> 46:29.787
Just move, will you!

47:32.975 --> 47:35.019
He is an ideal candidate,

47:35.102 --> 47:37.188
a respected lord
who will restore our standing

47:37.271 --> 47:38.731
in the eyes of those who doubt us.

47:38.814 --> 47:40.775
She's barely met him since she was a girl.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.860
I understand
this does not sit well with you.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.529
But this decision
has to be made strategically.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.156
We have no son.

47:50.743 --> 47:52.078
No heir.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.955
We should arrange the wedding
as quickly as we can.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.458
What else can we do?

47:58.334 --> 47:59.835
I have a solution.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.300
What is this?

48:06.384 --> 48:08.052
I know of your plans for me.

48:08.135 --> 48:12.014
And I beg of you,
let me train as a knight instead.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.975
I'm afraid you have me to blame for this.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.644
You condone this?

48:21.690 --> 48:23.275
I never wish to see you this way again.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.819
Father,
if you would just let me show you--

48:24.902 --> 48:26.278
Enough.

48:30.157 --> 48:32.451
You are old enough now to understand.

48:32.952 --> 48:34.578
This kingdom has no heir.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.165
We are all vulnerable,
every last one of us,

48:38.249 --> 48:39.750
until a successor is in place.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.378
-But I can be the successor.
-You're my child.

48:46.674 --> 48:51.303
You did not honestly think
that I would send you off to die,

48:51.387 --> 48:54.390
or worse, at the hands of some barbarian.

48:54.473 --> 48:57.476
But you'll sell me into the bedroom
of a man I barely know.

48:58.686 --> 49:01.230
He is an honorable lord of good family.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.816
I'm not a piece of property to be traded.

49:07.361 --> 49:10.614
I credited you with more maturity
than I should have.

49:11.365 --> 49:12.575
Now I see

49:12.658 --> 49:16.537
that you are just an impetuous girl
who only thinks about herself.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.542
This kingdom is relying on you.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.505
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.790
-Linh.
-Princess.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.297
What are you doing here?

50:08.380 --> 50:10.090
I was making my way to you.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.054
I'm glad you're here.

50:16.764 --> 50:18.724
I have something for these wounds.

50:21.393 --> 50:22.394
Come.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.855
Sit here.

50:29.485 --> 50:30.569
My family.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.112
I know.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.992
Mother always said that pain is beauty.

50:37.076 --> 50:39.703
I think she was talking about corsets.

50:44.375 --> 50:45.793
This will help.

50:49.338 --> 50:50.548
What happened, Linh?

50:51.549 --> 50:52.925
He came in the night.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.010
No one was prepared.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.682
The king's guards were overrun.

51:02.101 --> 51:03.769
Julius showed no mercy.

51:06.313 --> 51:09.775
I managed to escape and hide,
but was one of the few.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.820
He was ruthless.

51:18.367 --> 51:19.618
It's all my fault.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.332
Princess,

51:26.750 --> 51:29.295
that kind of thinking right now
won't help.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.136
I have to save them, Linh.

51:39.054 --> 51:40.222
We will.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.141
They're in the keep.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.519
There's only one unguarded way in.

51:46.729 --> 51:49.398
There's more rooms up here, lads.
Come on.

51:49.481 --> 51:51.525
We need to find a way to the sewers.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.737
But we have to pass
through the kitchen. Okay?

51:57.364 --> 51:59.283
Go on, then. You hungry?

51:59.366 --> 52:00.784
Out of the way. Move!

52:00.868 --> 52:02.202
Don't make me cut you.

52:12.546 --> 52:13.672
Oh, God.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.675
Hey, yeah.

52:24.224 --> 52:26.935
You think I'm gonna let you have
all the fun for yourself?

52:30.397 --> 52:31.649
Just remember,

52:32.650 --> 52:34.526
patience and focus.

52:35.819 --> 52:36.904
Okay.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.117
Come on. Let's go.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.745
We gotta find the princess.

52:45.537 --> 52:46.538
Come on.

52:48.374 --> 52:49.958
-Yeah!
-Come on.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.336
-Yes.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.504
Let's take that off.

52:54.171 --> 52:56.715
-You wanna come with me tonight?
-Psst.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.050
Ooh, tasty.

52:58.133 --> 53:01.011
-Get that off!
-No!

53:01.095 --> 53:03.847
-Come on, come on!
-Come here, love.

53:03.931 --> 53:06.392
Oh, yeah. Do you like my hand there?

53:06.475 --> 53:07.726
She loves it.

53:09.061 --> 53:11.897
-Don't touch me. No!
-Yes.

53:13.232 --> 53:14.233
Don't touch me!

53:14.316 --> 53:17.653
Hey, we ain't gonna hurt you… much.

53:21.323 --> 53:22.783
-Now, now.
-Yeah.

53:23.909 --> 53:27.329
-Oi! Where's my supper?
-Keep your voice down.

53:27.413 --> 53:28.580
What's happened to the cook?

53:28.664 --> 53:30.082
-Yes.
-Who are you?

53:30.916 --> 53:32.334
I'm the princess.

53:37.715 --> 53:38.799
And that's Linh.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.429
Nice to meet you.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.640
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

53:47.141 --> 53:48.225
Thank you.

53:52.771 --> 53:53.856
It's her.

53:54.815 --> 53:56.775
Sweet little princess.

54:09.204 --> 54:10.831
Here, you hungry, love?

54:39.276 --> 54:40.903
Well, go on, then!

54:49.703 --> 54:50.829
Come on.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.488
All you had to do was accept a ring.

55:25.948 --> 55:27.366
Instead, you made a mess.

55:29.201 --> 55:31.119
Why go through all this trouble?

55:31.787 --> 55:34.498
Be the weak little person
you were meant to be.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.461
Let's find out.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.325
Linh.

56:20.961 --> 56:22.004
Princess!

57:01.376 --> 57:02.836
Princess, you go. I'm gonna stop her.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.631
-I'm not leaving without you.
-Your family needs you.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.633
You have to leave now
before it's too late.

57:07.716 --> 57:09.843
-Linh, no.
-Princess, trust me.

57:09.927 --> 57:10.886
Go now. Go!

58:17.619 --> 58:19.538
-All right. You ready, boys?
-Oh, yeah.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.124
My last coin.

58:22.624 --> 58:25.627
-I spent my money at the tower.

58:25.711 --> 58:29.089
Yeah, you wanna get down to the brothel.
They let you drink for free.

58:29.172 --> 58:32.426
Oh, yeah? I wonder why that is.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.471
No drink, no win.

58:37.139 --> 58:38.348
Right, hit me.

58:38.432 --> 58:40.308
Go on, then. Hurry up.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.855
What--

59:12.674 --> 59:13.675
I needed that.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.013
Enough.

59:21.892 --> 59:22.893
Come on!

59:55.634 --> 59:56.927
I knew it.

59:58.053 --> 59:59.179
Well, then.

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:01.681
Shall we?

1:00:05.143 --> 1:00:06.478
Violet.

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:09.064
We have to go. Okay.

1:00:09.815 --> 1:00:10.899
Stay close.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:12.984
Stay close to me.

1:00:18.657 --> 1:00:19.783
Come on, come.

1:01:12.961 --> 1:01:14.504
Look at the mess you've made.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.967
Not exactly the ladylike behavior
I'd expect of you.

1:01:21.261 --> 1:01:22.554
But that will change.

1:01:29.895 --> 1:01:32.063
-Leave my sister alone!
-Violet, no.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:36.067
Have we not talked about your manners?

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:39.404
You're an oddity.

1:01:40.739 --> 1:01:43.074
What on earth happened
to make you end up this way?

1:01:43.158 --> 1:01:44.576
I was born this way.

1:01:44.659 --> 1:01:46.953
No, you were born to be my wife.

1:01:49.831 --> 1:01:51.374
I look forward to it.

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:56.421
Oh, you do?

1:01:57.964 --> 1:01:59.174
At your side.

1:02:00.342 --> 1:02:01.468
Every day.

1:02:04.763 --> 1:02:06.556
At your service every night.

1:02:08.808 --> 1:02:11.144
It's like something out of a fairy tale…

1:02:12.395 --> 1:02:13.563
for me.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:16.650
And for me?

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:22.989
A nightmare.

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:29.788
You'll learn to sleep with one eye open.

1:02:31.539 --> 1:02:33.708
To never turn your back.

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:36.086
I'll be in heaven,

1:02:36.878 --> 1:02:40.590
just thinking day and night

1:02:40.674 --> 1:02:42.217
of ways to kill you.

1:02:43.885 --> 1:02:45.053
And you'll be in hell…

1:02:46.972 --> 1:02:50.100
wondering when it's coming.

1:02:51.893 --> 1:02:54.145
And you know that it will be coming.

1:02:57.440 --> 1:02:59.943
Because you know that I'll never rest,

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:04.239
never idle, never stop,

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:09.035
until I am standing above your corpse,

1:03:09.869 --> 1:03:14.958
holding, in my delicate, manicured hands,

1:03:16.209 --> 1:03:19.045
your still-beating heart.

1:03:31.057 --> 1:03:33.518
Well, it seems the princess
is still unwilling.

1:03:38.898 --> 1:03:41.151
If only there were another option.

1:03:50.076 --> 1:03:51.119
No.

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:58.710
You look as though you won't be
nearly as much trouble as your sister.

1:03:59.919 --> 1:04:01.588
Julius, you wouldn't.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:02.756
Wouldn't I?

1:04:09.637 --> 1:04:10.638
Kill the princess.

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:11.598
No!

1:04:11.681 --> 1:04:13.141
-No, stop!
-Julius, please!

1:04:19.814 --> 1:04:20.982
Get back here!

1:04:29.366 --> 1:04:30.200
No!

1:04:55.016 --> 1:04:57.477
And always remember, Princess,

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:00.188
the real power is not from your blade,

1:05:01.189 --> 1:05:02.482
but from your heart.

1:05:03.191 --> 1:05:04.359
What is this?

1:05:04.442 --> 1:05:06.319
I am strong. I can fight.

1:05:06.403 --> 1:05:07.529
You're my child.

1:05:07.612 --> 1:05:09.489
I never wish to see you this way again.

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:13.034
-When I slit the king's throat.
-I have to save them, Linh.

1:05:13.118 --> 1:05:15.745
-Julius, you wouldn't.
-Wouldn't I?

1:05:29.175 --> 1:05:33.680
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights,

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:37.016
but by what she is fighting for.

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:13.970
-Come on, boys.
-Come on.

1:06:16.014 --> 1:06:17.974
You. There.

1:06:18.516 --> 1:06:19.976
Stand in the middle as before.

1:06:21.019 --> 1:06:22.729
Bring in the rest of our guests.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:25.482
And where is Violet? Find her now.

1:06:27.609 --> 1:06:28.693
Find the girl!

1:06:28.776 --> 1:06:30.278
Come on, move!

1:06:30.361 --> 1:06:33.281
-You, that way. In there.
-Quickly!

1:06:51.090 --> 1:06:52.926
Oi! Get up.

1:06:53.551 --> 1:06:55.470
Come with me. Get up.

1:07:18.493 --> 1:07:19.744
Did I help?

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:23.623
-Good job.
-Oh, yes!

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:26.918
Oh, thank you, Violet. Yeah.

1:07:28.795 --> 1:07:31.339
Princess. You survived.

1:07:38.012 --> 1:07:39.639
It seems so childish now.

1:07:40.807 --> 1:07:43.434
Me telling you
that I wanted to be a warrior.

1:07:46.521 --> 1:07:48.189
If I had just done my duty--

1:07:48.273 --> 1:07:50.191
No, Princess. No.

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:53.861
Julius would be the same monster
no matter what you did.

1:07:57.907 --> 1:08:00.702
You have to stop him.

1:08:09.043 --> 1:08:10.670
Come with us. Come on.

1:08:12.046 --> 1:08:13.631
Linh, you go first.

1:08:20.054 --> 1:08:23.683
This is one of our storehouses,
in the event of a siege.

1:08:50.543 --> 1:08:53.296
-Let's get you ready.
-Yes.

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:56.382
-Look everywhere. Come on!
-Come on! Find that child!

1:08:57.175 --> 1:08:59.010
Quickly! Find the child!

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:12.023
Little Violet can't hide forever.
We will find her.

1:09:12.607 --> 1:09:15.360
Check in there! Get a move on!

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.196
What do you think?

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:04.200
I want to fight too.

1:10:07.412 --> 1:10:08.496
You know,

1:10:09.455 --> 1:10:14.168
I once knew a princess that said
the exact same thing at your age.

1:10:14.252 --> 1:10:16.629
But you got to do it.

1:10:19.799 --> 1:10:22.885
And you will too.
I will see to it myself, I promise.

1:10:24.262 --> 1:10:25.430
But until then…

1:10:27.056 --> 1:10:29.308
Hidden. Quiet. Alive.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:31.352
Yes. That's my girl.

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.231
I love you.

1:10:40.236 --> 1:10:41.237
Stay safe.

1:10:58.588 --> 1:11:01.215
Well, now we're all here.

1:11:03.426 --> 1:11:04.886
Call for Violet.

1:11:05.636 --> 1:11:07.013
She'll come to you.

1:11:08.389 --> 1:11:10.641
I'll cut out my tongue first.

1:11:11.559 --> 1:11:14.645
Yes, it may come to that.

1:11:24.322 --> 1:11:25.364
Come on!

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:48.262
She refuses death, time and time again.

1:11:50.306 --> 1:11:51.808
Not for much longer.

1:12:03.444 --> 1:12:05.822
-Come on. Move!
-Come on! Let's go!

1:12:38.521 --> 1:12:39.522
Go on!

1:12:42.191 --> 1:12:43.192
Hyah!

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.869
We've got to find a way in!

1:13:13.931 --> 1:13:15.349
Stay where you are!

1:13:17.894 --> 1:13:19.937
Keep them under control outside.

1:13:20.021 --> 1:13:23.065
And make sure it is done properly
this time, you understand?

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:24.692
Yes, milord. Come on.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.964
Aim at the joints. Trust me.

1:14:03.481 --> 1:14:04.941
-Gotcha!

1:14:13.032 --> 1:14:14.158
Come here!

1:14:15.034 --> 1:14:16.494
-Get up.
-Violet!

1:14:18.496 --> 1:14:20.665
-Julius!
-Your eldest daughter…

1:14:20.748 --> 1:14:24.460
-I'll kill you. Get away from me!
-…is about to become a corpse.

1:14:25.252 --> 1:14:27.922
-And as for the little one…

1:14:28.005 --> 1:14:29.090
Kneel.

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:31.926
Marry us.

1:14:32.677 --> 1:14:35.388
We have to get in there. Let's split up.

1:14:40.685 --> 1:14:41.936
Come on then!

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:05.292
Go on.

1:15:37.575 --> 1:15:38.617
Take her!

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:56.135
Now!

1:16:13.319 --> 1:16:15.071
I underestimated you.

1:16:15.696 --> 1:16:17.990
That's okay. I'm used to that.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:34.423
Linh.

1:17:07.957 --> 1:17:09.625
-No, don't!

1:17:11.377 --> 1:17:12.920
Julius, please!

1:17:15.089 --> 1:17:16.924
Go! Move, move, move!

1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:21.470
-Come.
-Linh!

1:17:26.517 --> 1:17:28.310
That sword doesn't belong to you.

1:18:39.590 --> 1:18:40.841
Linh!

1:18:50.726 --> 1:18:52.186
Linh!

1:18:52.269 --> 1:18:54.480
No! No!

1:18:59.068 --> 1:19:00.194
No!

1:19:04.281 --> 1:19:05.282
No.

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:58.961
Get to safety.

1:20:04.550 --> 1:20:07.011
It looks like you got me
to the altar after all.

1:20:07.803 --> 1:20:08.804
Yes.

1:20:10.055 --> 1:20:11.432
I told you I would,

1:20:12.599 --> 1:20:13.684
didn't I?

1:20:22.443 --> 1:20:23.527
Hyah!

1:20:37.207 --> 1:20:39.793
Your parents wept the day you were born.

1:20:40.294 --> 1:20:41.462
I was there.

1:20:42.588 --> 1:20:45.549
They were so upset that you weren't a man.

1:20:47.551 --> 1:20:48.886
Well, I heard…

1:20:50.846 --> 1:20:52.598
yours wept for the same reason.

1:21:00.731 --> 1:21:01.815
Yeah.

1:21:21.460 --> 1:21:25.047
I was going to make
your little sister's life

1:21:25.714 --> 1:21:28.342
much, much easier…

1:21:30.844 --> 1:21:33.680
until you started behaving like this.

1:22:05.087 --> 1:22:06.213
Here she is.

1:22:07.548 --> 1:22:09.758
Your pretty princess.

1:22:11.885 --> 1:22:15.556
Kneeling before the new king.

1:22:17.391 --> 1:22:21.186
A reminder to you all
that I won't be belittled.

1:22:21.937 --> 1:22:23.397
I won't be forsaken

1:22:24.565 --> 1:22:26.817
in this weak and feeble kingdom.

1:22:28.152 --> 1:22:30.654
That power is required on the throne.

1:22:38.537 --> 1:22:39.997
I will be that power.

1:22:41.248 --> 1:22:44.710
I will rule with aggression
like no one else before!

1:22:47.629 --> 1:22:48.714
Patience…

1:22:49.882 --> 1:22:53.594
A reminder to you people.

1:22:55.345 --> 1:22:58.390
-I will never, ever…

1:22:59.224 --> 1:23:03.270
…have taken from me
what is rightfully mine.

1:23:05.105 --> 1:23:06.231
…and focus.

1:23:07.357 --> 1:23:08.734
It was never yours.

1:24:24.142 --> 1:24:26.603
The kingdom is ours again.

1:24:44.663 --> 1:24:46.873
Ring the chapel bells until midnight

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.293
because today,

1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:52.421
an heir to the kingdom was born.

1:25:23.952 --> 1:25:24.995
Henceforth,

1:25:25.996 --> 1:25:28.498
the daughters of this kingdom
make their own fate,

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:31.585
just as my daughter has done today.

1:25:35.839 --> 1:25:37.341
I have never been more proud.

1:25:39.051 --> 1:25:41.637
We are, all of us, in your debt.

1:25:42.387 --> 1:25:43.722
I was wrong.

1:25:44.222 --> 1:25:45.641
I should have trusted you.

1:25:48.644 --> 1:25:49.770
Forgive me.

1:25:55.984 --> 1:25:57.110
Now, rise.

1:26:02.616 --> 1:26:05.577
And let the people see
their future leader for who she is.

1:26:30.102 --> 1:26:31.103
Linh?

1:26:31.186 --> 1:26:32.396
-Linh.
-Princess.

1:26:32.479 --> 1:26:34.189
You're alive.

1:26:35.065 --> 1:26:36.191
You're alive.

1:26:45.701 --> 1:26:46.868
Princess.

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.044
You did it.

1:26:56.962 --> 1:26:58.213
You did it.

1:27:24.531 --> 1:27:25.782
There she is!
