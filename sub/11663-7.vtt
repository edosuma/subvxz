What are you all looking at?

01:16.767 --> 01:17.700
You.

01:17.767 --> 01:19.367
What are you so happy about?

01:19.433 --> 01:22.433
There's only one thing
that makes her this happy.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.600
You're going back to Shady Pines?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.667
No, you moron. She has a date.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.200
Oh...

01:34.266 --> 01:36.633
(both laugh)

01:37.300 --> 01:39.734
Is that true, Dorothy?
You have a date tonight?

01:40.467 --> 01:43.567
Rose, that's an awfully
personal question to...

01:43.633 --> 01:44.633
Yes!

01:45.600 --> 01:48.734
Dorothy Zbornak has a date
on a Saturday night

01:48.800 --> 01:50.767
and Blanche Devereaux does not?

01:50.834 --> 01:53.500
That sounds like an idea
for Stephen King book.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.533
(cackles)

01:55.567 --> 01:58.633
I wasn't going to tell you
who I'm going out with

01:58.700 --> 02:01.000
because I thought
it might hurt your feelings,

02:01.066 --> 02:03.166
but I realize now that's a plus.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.166
It so happens I'm having dinner with...

02:08.834 --> 02:12.767
Dr. Lee Kagan, a medical corporation.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.533
Not our Dr. Kagan.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.467
The Dr. Lee Kagan
I love more than life itself?

02:19.533 --> 02:20.867
Dr. Kagan?

02:21.300 --> 02:24.867
Hubba-hubba, zing-zing, baby,
he's got everything.

02:27.567 --> 02:30.900
I've been disrobing in front of Dr. Kagan
for three years.

02:30.967 --> 02:33.967
Why ask you out
when he's seen the Promised Land?

02:36.133 --> 02:37.400
I really don't know.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.367
Too many squatters?

02:42.467 --> 02:43.567
Don't wait up.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.266
Hold it right there.

02:45.667 --> 02:46.900
He's not picking you up?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.533
What guy doesn't pick up his date?

02:48.600 --> 02:52.200
We decided to meet at L'auberge.
It's no big deal.

02:52.266 --> 02:53.967
Oh, wait just a minute.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.900
This whole thing is a trick.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.867
You're making us think
you're going out with him.

02:58.934 --> 03:00.900
I am not lying.

03:00.967 --> 03:04.767
You're just jealous about the fact
that I have a date on a Saturday night

03:04.834 --> 03:05.867
and you don't.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.600
Saturday night? Kid stuff.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.867
Get lucky on a Tuesday morning,
then call me.

03:13.967 --> 03:17.300
I guess I'm just not attracted
to crossing guards.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.734
Dorothy, a guy sets a folding chair
up in front of my house,

03:23.800 --> 03:25.033
I want to know more.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.734
Well, I'm off.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.633
If you need to keep occupied, Rose,

03:30.700 --> 03:34.433
take out a good book
and see if you can find Waldo.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.367
(cackles)

03:39.266 --> 03:39.934
(door closes)

03:40.834 --> 03:42.400
I've never liked her.

03:46.033 --> 03:47.767
I don't care what Dorothy says.

03:47.834 --> 03:52.467
Any man who doesn't pick a lady up
is a jerk, plain and simple.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.934
He's obviously a jerk.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.834
Well, he's taking her to L'auberge.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.266
Jerks love that place.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.433
I went there once
with the biggest jerk in the world.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.467
It was right after Charlie died.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.500
I'd just moved to Miami.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.066
I was very vulnerable,

04:08.567 --> 04:12.734
and I did something
that I guess was a little dumb.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.567
-No!
-No!

04:16.567 --> 04:18.767
(Rose) <i>I agreed to go out on a blind date.</i>

04:18.834 --> 04:21.233
This is my favorite restaurant.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.600
Have you been here before?

04:22.667 --> 04:23.800
No.

04:23.867 --> 04:28.633
I'm just starting to get back
in the social scene, and it isn't easy.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.934
There are so many jerks out there.

04:31.033 --> 04:34.367
Don't worry about me.
I'm so normal, I'm dull.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.734
Oh, you're not dull.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.200
I mean, compared to not dating at all.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.433
(laughs)

04:41.500 --> 04:43.734
Rose, maybe I shouldn't say this

04:43.800 --> 04:46.333
because someday,
I hope to be a supreme court justice,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.200
but you are quite a babe.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.667
Well, thank you.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.600
This place is nice. You come here a lot?

04:57.667 --> 05:00.600
Not really. I don't have a social life.

05:00.667 --> 05:04.266
So, this is where you bring
your cheap fake blonde floozies.

05:06.066 --> 05:09.800
John, you disgust me, and as far
as I'm concerned, we're through.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.000
Oh!

05:12.333 --> 05:13.867
Who was that?

05:14.834 --> 05:15.767
My sister.

05:18.367 --> 05:22.100
May I recommend the Poulet Veronique?

05:22.166 --> 05:23.266
I have a rule.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.166
If I can't pronounce it,
I don't put it in my mouth.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.567
Say, do they have Gougenflucter?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.000
Alan.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.000
Alan, please talk to me.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.433
You haven't answered my calls, my letters.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.900
Alan, what can I do to get you back?

05:40.967 --> 05:42.100
Alan?

05:43.066 --> 05:43.834
Nickname.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.633
Susan, please.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.667
This is not the time or the place.

05:50.734 --> 05:51.600
It's me, isn't it?

05:51.667 --> 05:52.767
I've driven you away.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.400
What if I dyed my hair?

05:54.867 --> 05:56.567
I'd even dye it that color...

05:57.000 --> 05:58.700
If they still make that color.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.667
Susan, it's over,
and you have to accept that.

06:02.734 --> 06:06.033
A word of warning,
I haven't graded your final exam.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.000
So, shall we order separate entrees
and share?

06:13.066 --> 06:14.800
Hold it. Who was that?

06:14.867 --> 06:19.367
Okay, I've had a couple
of bad relationships with women.

06:19.433 --> 06:20.800
That's not so unusual.

06:20.867 --> 06:23.200
(laughs)
Now, where is our waiter?

06:23.266 --> 06:24.333
Oh, waiter?

06:25.900 --> 06:27.900
Well, well, Peter.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.967
We just swing the way the wind blows,
don't we?

06:35.567 --> 06:38.433
And who's this,
Glinda, the good witch of the north?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.633
You disgust me.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.700
After the way you've treated me,
I should scratch your eyes out.

06:45.934 --> 06:46.734
Call me.

06:50.567 --> 06:51.500
Poker buddy.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.233
I don't think this dinner
was such a good idea.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.967
Rose, please don't leap to conclusions.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.266
I'm sorry, John.
I'll just catch a cab home.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.533
Rose, you're hurting my feelings.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.033
This is not what it seems.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.667
John Patrick Anderson is a regular guy.

07:09.734 --> 07:10.734
Shlomo Ziegler?

07:10.800 --> 07:11.567
Yes?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.700
You're under arrest.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.900
Your days as the freeway flasher are over.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.200
I know what you're thinking,
but if I make bail, can I see you?

07:22.266 --> 07:23.734
I don't think so.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.266
May I call you? I get one phone call.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.533
Men!

07:30.133 --> 07:32.266
I think we both need a hug.

07:38.600 --> 07:43.467
Oh, he was such a jerk,
and he was no better on our second date.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.133
I can't believe Dorothy's been out
for three hours.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.233
I'm getting worried.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.867
Maybe I should call the police.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.233
Nah, he's probably okay.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.166
It's after midnight.
She must be having fun.

08:00.233 --> 08:01.433
Not necessarily.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.300
What do you mean?

08:02.367 --> 08:05.300
Don't you remember a date we had
a few years back?

08:05.367 --> 08:08.033
-Oh, that. New Year's Eve.
-(Blanche) Uh-huh.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.800
Oh, I remember.

08:09.867 --> 08:14.000
You and Dorothy were in New York,
and I was alone.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.100
That was before Blanche
brought those brothers home

08:17.166 --> 08:18.300
from the Rusty Anchor.

08:18.367 --> 08:22.300
Blanche, you knew I wanted
to spend tonight alone.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.734
Rose, nobody who says
they wanna be alone on New Year's Eve

08:24.800 --> 08:26.066
ever really means it.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.066
I did.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.467
Well, you're a freak.

08:32.266 --> 08:35.033
It's bad luck
if you don't get kissed at midnight.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.533
My New Year's Eve kiss
is my most important one.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.700
It sets the tone for the next 365 days.

08:43.333 --> 08:47.433
One year I didn't get kissed at midnight
on New Year's Eve,

08:47.500 --> 08:49.133
I didn't get lucky till...

08:49.200 --> 08:50.667
after the Orange Bowl.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.867
Well, if being kissed
is all you care about,

08:55.934 --> 08:57.867
why not stay at the Rusty Anchor?

08:58.367 --> 08:59.967
Oh, it was too crowded.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.934
They threw you out again, didn't they?

09:05.400 --> 09:09.433
Like I'm the only person who ever mixed
a margarita in a sailor's mouth.

09:15.867 --> 09:16.734
Hi, fellas.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.533
Here's something you can nibble on.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.700
And we brought you
some hors d'oeuvres, too.

09:20.767 --> 09:21.467
(chuckles)

09:22.667 --> 09:26.066
Rose, isn't there something
you want to show Arnie?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.200
Oh, now that you mention it, Blanche,

09:28.266 --> 09:29.533
no, there isn't.

09:32.266 --> 09:35.467
Rose, remember our signal
when I want you to leave?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.934
You wouldn't hit me in front of company.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.333
Arnie, I want to show you
the answer to a riddle.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.166
What's Irish and stays out all night?

09:50.233 --> 09:51.834
I don't know. What, Rose?

09:51.900 --> 09:53.667
Paddy O'Furniture.

09:53.734 --> 09:54.500
(laughs)

09:57.133 --> 09:58.800
(chuckles)

09:58.867 --> 10:01.166
I'm going to get you for this, Bob.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.333
Well, Bob...

10:05.400 --> 10:07.934
Finally, I have you all to myself.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.100
Why don't I fix us some drinks?

10:10.166 --> 10:11.834
Actually, I don't drink.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.867
Oh. Then I know what'll loosen us up,
a game with my naughty cards from Denmark.

10:16.934 --> 10:17.600
(chuckles)

10:18.333 --> 10:20.500
Aces are high, and I'm wild.

10:20.567 --> 10:21.867
(both laugh)

10:22.800 --> 10:25.200
Well, I really don't gamble either,
Blanche.

10:25.266 --> 10:26.867
Believe me, it's no gamble.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.600
You know what I do like?

10:30.667 --> 10:31.867
I like music.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.567
Music? Well, wonderful. We can dance.

10:34.633 --> 10:38.367
We can do that hot, sweaty
South American dance they do in the street

10:38.433 --> 10:40.166
'cause they don't have television sets.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.333
(both chuckle)

10:41.400 --> 10:43.233
You got me again, Blanche.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.400
I don't dance.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.867
You don't drink, gamble, or dance.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.667
What are you, a priest?

10:48.734 --> 10:49.667
Yes.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.900
So, where are you guys from?

10:57.967 --> 11:00.133
I think I detected an accent.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.467
What does it matter?

11:01.533 --> 11:04.800
Life is just one bottomless pit
of muck and despair.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.166
Let me guess. New Jersey?

11:14.633 --> 11:18.734
Rose, I can't pretend,
even on New Year's Eve.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.967
The truth is,
I recently lost my beloved wife.

11:22.033 --> 11:23.066
She's gone.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.033
And it's on nights like this
when it really hits me.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.934
Oh, Arnie, I'm so sorry.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.066
You know, it's moments like this,

11:33.133 --> 11:36.533
it helps to know that time heals all.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.266
You know what else works?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.233
A good back rub.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.400
So, I left the priesthood four months ago.

11:45.467 --> 11:50.400
It was a very difficult decision,
but after some soul-searching,

11:50.467 --> 11:53.333
everybody agreed
I could do more good on the outside.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.567 --> 11:55.467
So...

12:02.166 --> 12:05.834
I guess these last four months
have just been one big party, huh?

12:05.900 --> 12:06.800
(both laugh)

12:06.867 --> 12:10.033
I haven't been to any discotheques
if that's what you mean.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.467
My brother Arnie dragged me out tonight.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.667
This is my first date.

12:17.266 --> 12:18.200
You mean...

12:25.734 --> 12:26.734
Your...

12:27.233 --> 12:28.500
first date ever?

12:28.567 --> 12:31.300
That's right.
I've never been with a woman.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.967
Well, not in the biblical sense.

12:34.033 --> 12:35.667
Whoops! There I go again.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.867
You can take the boy
out of the seminary, but...

12:37.934 --> 12:39.900
(chuckles)

12:41.767 --> 12:43.700
Let me get this straight.

12:43.767 --> 12:44.633
Um...

12:45.900 --> 12:47.033
You've never...

12:51.300 --> 12:52.100
Never ever?

12:56.133 --> 12:57.433
Not once.

12:59.066 --> 13:02.533
Have you even thought about it?

13:04.100 --> 13:04.767
Only...

13:05.800 --> 13:06.867
All the time.

13:09.300 --> 13:12.433
To be honest,
I've never even seen a naked lady.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.433
So, what we're saying here is...

13:21.633 --> 13:22.633
You're a virgin?

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
A virgin.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.934
Oh, God.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.633
This brings out the artist in me.

13:43.133 --> 13:47.100
(quirky music playing)

13:47.567 --> 13:50.533
So, you can imagine
how relieved farmer Gunlinger was

13:50.600 --> 13:53.700
when he looked up and saw
it wasn't his cow up in that tree.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.900
(sobbing)

13:58.000 --> 13:59.700
Arnie, what's... What's the matter?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.033
The cow story.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.233
My wife's name was Elsie.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.633
Oh, Arnie, I'm sor...

14:08.700 --> 14:10.900
How can I make you feel better?

14:10.967 --> 14:13.100
You know what would make me feel better?

14:13.166 --> 14:15.133
You could hold me.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.066
Oh.

14:21.367 --> 14:22.567
Now, how's that?

14:22.934 --> 14:24.166
Better.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.367
Here we go.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.767
Blanche, you don't have to do this.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.200
But I want to, Bob.

14:32.266 --> 14:34.767
Your first time should be really special.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.333
You need a woman
who won't make you nervous

14:42.400 --> 14:46.667
or put unrealistic demands on you.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.133
A woman who'll be tender
and kind and gentle.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.900
Where the heck is that riding crop?

15:03.367 --> 15:06.100
Are you sure this is helping you
get over your grief?

15:07.400 --> 15:12.767
I think so, but you know
what would make me feel even better?

15:12.834 --> 15:14.633
-What?
-A kiss.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.734
A New Year's Eve kiss.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.033
Oh, I don't know.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.133
In memory of my late wife.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.800
When you put it that way, I...

15:34.300 --> 15:38.433
Now, you know what would make me
feel really great?

15:40.867 --> 15:43.900
So, tell me how you're feeling, Bob.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.667
Nervous.

15:46.700 --> 15:47.700
Excited.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.633
Spiritually confused.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.433
Did I mention excited?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.367
Let the games begin.

15:59.100 --> 15:59.900
Oh, boy.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.767
(cackles)

16:03.100 --> 16:04.934
So how do I start?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.233
Oh, how do we start, Bob?

16:07.300 --> 16:11.934
Well, 98 times out of 100 I think
the best way to start is with a kiss.

16:13.066 --> 16:14.467
What are the other two?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.200
Baby steps, Bob. Baby steps.

16:21.467 --> 16:22.300
Oh, boy.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.900
You are gross and disgusting,
and you make my skin crawl.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.333
You can help me change.

16:31.934 --> 16:33.467
Rose, what's going on?

16:33.533 --> 16:36.934
Arnie thinks I'll sleep with him
because his wife died.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.734
Hold it. Elsie's not dead.
She's at a fat farm in Sarasota.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.433
Now the truth's out, Rose,
don't you feel sorry for me?

16:48.333 --> 16:49.600
Get out!

16:49.667 --> 16:50.333
Call you?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.467
Get out!

16:53.667 --> 16:55.300
What is it with men?

16:55.367 --> 16:58.767
Why have sex with somebody
you've only known a few hours?

17:02.867 --> 17:03.967
Rose.

17:04.033 --> 17:07.700
Why can't they understand
sex is no good without someone you love.

17:07.767 --> 17:08.533
Rose.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.967
The very thought makes me feel dirty.

17:12.033 --> 17:12.800
Rose!

17:12.867 --> 17:15.633
Oh, gosh, she's right. I do feel dirty.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.834
Well, don't worry. You'll get used to it.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.533
Blanche, I'm going home,
getting down on my knees,

17:23.600 --> 17:25.100
and begging for forgiveness.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.500
Yeah, we can do that.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.200
Wait!

17:30.967 --> 17:36.033
Oh, but I didn't get my New Year's kiss
and it's almost midnight.

17:36.100 --> 17:36.867
Darn it!

17:37.200 --> 17:39.333
I got to kiss somebody at midnight.

17:40.333 --> 17:44.700
(man on TV) <i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

17:44.767 --> 17:47.200
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

17:47.266 --> 17:50.767
(cheering on TV)

17:57.033 --> 17:59.367
Don't even think about it.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.533
This guy's a jerk
because he didn't sleep with you?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.834
Yeah. What did you think I was saying?

18:12.700 --> 18:16.233
Gosh, it's getting late.
It's after 1:00 and Dorothy's not home.

18:16.734 --> 18:19.233
I guess Dr. Kagan's turning out
to be wonderful.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.600
Maybe he drugged her
and sold her into white slavery.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.166
Either way,
I'm glad she's out of the house.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.133
Now, sit back and listen.
I got a jerk story.

18:33.200 --> 18:33.967
Okay.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.967
Picture it, Brooklyn, 1948.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.333
My friend's son
was helping me around the house.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.400
<i>I was expecting Dorothy home any minute.</i>

18:42.467 --> 18:44.934
I finished stacking those crates,
Mrs. Petrillo.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.800
Thank you, Myron. You're a good kid.

18:46.867 --> 18:49.867
Before you go,
I'd like to have a talk with you.

18:50.834 --> 18:54.400
Myron, I've always thought
you are a bright young man,

18:54.467 --> 18:57.033
talented, ambitious, smart,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.166
I'm not going out with your daughter,
Mrs. Petrillo.

19:01.367 --> 19:02.233
You've got to, Myron.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.133
She's spending too much time
with this Zbornak.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.133
She hasn't had a real date.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.867
I'm sorry, Mrs. Petrillo.
She's just not my type.

19:09.934 --> 19:11.200
I see.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.500
How about Mr. Hamilton? Is he your type?

19:15.967 --> 19:17.500
What time should I pick her up?

19:18.633 --> 19:20.900
7:30, and buy her something pretty.

19:20.967 --> 19:24.066
Okay, but if you want me to kiss her,
it's extra.

19:26.033 --> 19:27.233
But no tongue.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.867
Ah, what the hell?

19:35.433 --> 19:36.600
Oh, look.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.633
My beautiful daughter is home from school.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.567
Hello, pussycat. Sam.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.233
It's Stan, Mrs. Petrillo.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.266
Yeah, right. Now, find someone who cares.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.166
Ma, we got something really important
to tell you.

19:48.233 --> 19:51.834
It can wait.
Dorothy, you remember Myron, don't you?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.600
Ma, we got to talk now.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.033
Don't be rude, Dorothy. We have a guest.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.266
You were saying, Myron?

19:57.967 --> 20:01.000
Dorothy, I was wondering
if you'd do me the honor

20:01.066 --> 20:02.734
of going out with me tomorrow night.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.633
What do you say, Dorothy?

20:05.233 --> 20:06.467
I'm pregnant.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.433
This is going to cost a lot more.

20:12.066 --> 20:13.667
Deal's off, Myron. You better go.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.834
-But what about this?
-Hush money.

20:19.934 --> 20:22.967
Mrs. Petrillo,
I don't know how this happened.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.066
Let's see.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.033
Did you both drink out of the same cup?

20:27.433 --> 20:30.834
Stanley, go into the kitchen.
I want to talk to Ma in private.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.900
I'm sorry, Ma.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.066
I know I've disappointed you.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.934
How could you let this happen?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.633
How could you throw everything away
for an hour's worth of passion?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.633
I don't know. It sort of...

20:44.700 --> 20:46.000
An hour's worth?

20:46.066 --> 20:47.633
It's supposed to take an hour?

20:49.033 --> 20:52.533
You were going to be the first Petrillo
in college.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.567
You were going to teach.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.767
I'll be a teacher. This won't change that.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.000
Now, when you say an hour,
does that include everything?

21:02.467 --> 21:04.600
Dorothy, we've got to get you married.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.400
Stan's asked me to marry him.

21:06.467 --> 21:09.166
But who could we get? Who?

21:10.100 --> 21:11.900
I told Stan yes.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.133
Did you sign anything?

21:15.166 --> 21:16.400
Ma.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.333
I guess we have no choice.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.800
My baby is having a baby.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.467
I can't believe it.

21:25.934 --> 21:26.600
Ma...

21:27.667 --> 21:29.266
(sighs)
I'm scared.

21:29.834 --> 21:34.066
Look, pussycat,
even though it's going to hurt a lot,

21:34.133 --> 21:35.900
and I do mean a lot,

21:38.033 --> 21:41.367
there's something special
about bringing a new life into this world,

21:41.834 --> 21:45.767
and this child's got lots of love
waiting for him right here.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.033
(sighs)
Thanks, Ma.

21:51.934 --> 21:53.967
I don't believe I did this.

21:54.033 --> 21:55.433
And I hate his name.

21:55.500 --> 21:59.100
For the rest of my life,
I'll be Dorothy Zbornak.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.934
Look on the bright side.
At least he's got a full head of hair.

22:06.900 --> 22:09.300
Wow, Sophia. That was some story.

22:09.367 --> 22:12.967
Yes, it was, funny, touching,
with a surprise twist ending.

22:13.567 --> 22:14.834
I wonder if it was true.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.233
Ah, damn that stroke.

22:21.934 --> 22:23.834
Ah, Dorothy, you're home.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.467
Well, doesn't anyone want to hear
how my date turned out?

22:29.533 --> 22:31.333
Was it just terrible?

22:31.400 --> 22:33.200
Sweetheart, you can tell us.

22:33.266 --> 22:35.533
It was wonderful.

22:35.600 --> 22:39.300
Really? Where is Dr. Marvelous?
What man doesn't walk a girl to the door?

22:39.367 --> 22:42.200
One who's too exhausted to walk?

22:44.367 --> 22:47.166
Dorothy Zbornak, I am shocked.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.300
And I want details.

22:50.066 --> 22:52.800
I tell you, the night was just magical.

22:52.867 --> 22:56.600
We laughed, we danced, we drank, we cried.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.533
We did it all. Even...

22:59.500 --> 23:01.934
No, I can't tell you. I'm too shy.

23:03.767 --> 23:07.266
(upbeat music playing)

23:10.400 --> 23:13.400
(closing theme music playing)
