18:58.178 --> 19:01.932
{\an4}WHY COULDN'T I LOOK
MORE CLOSELY AND SEE

19:02.015 --> 19:06.061
{\an1}AND HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO THOUGHTLESS TO CLOD?

19:13.443 --> 19:14.319
STOP HIM?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.696
HE WAS GOING TO THROW

19:15.779 --> 19:18.073
ALL OF HIS PAINTINGS
OFF OF A CLIFF.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.241
WHOA! WHAT?

19:19.324 --> 19:19.867
BUT WHERE
COULD HE BE?

19:19.950 --> 19:22.077
THERE! WINDY PEAKS.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.039
{\an1}THEY'VE GOT THE BIGGEST
CLIFFS AROUND.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.249
THEN HOP ON, PEOPLE.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.168
WE'RE GOING TO WINDY PEAKS.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.007
AT LAST, THE BIG CLIFF.

19:35.090 --> 19:39.761
NOW NO ONE WILL HAVE TO
LOOK AT MY PAINTINGS EVER AGAIN.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.348
NELLA: THERE HE IS!

19:43.432 --> 19:44.433
CLOD! OH!

19:44.516 --> 19:47.144
{\an1}I'M SO VERY, VERY SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.646

TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

19:49.730 --> 19:51.648

ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS

19:51.732 --> 19:53.734

19:53.817 --> 19:56.236
{\an1}EVER, EVER, EVER
FORGIVE ME.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.864
{\an1}CAN YOU? PLEASE?
PLEASE.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.242
OH, OF COURSE I
FORGIVE YOU, TRINKET.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.911
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.830
{\an1}UM, WHERE IS YOUR
ART CART, CLOD?

20:06.914 --> 20:09.166
OH, I PUSHED IT
DOWN THAT WAY.

20:09.249 --> 20:12.377
{\an1}NELLA: IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT
TOWARD WINDY CANYON.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.921
WHAT DO WE DO?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.298
{\an1}WE GOT TO CATCH IT
BEFORE IT FALLS.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.426
ALMOST.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.428
[ALL GASP]

20:21.511 --> 20:23.430
GARRETT: NO!

20:23.513 --> 20:24.640
NELLA: OH, MY GOSH.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.642
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.393
I'M SO SORRY,
CLOD.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.562
THIS IS ALL
MY FAULT.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.563
WAIT A MINUTE. LOOK.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.399
ALL: WOW!

20:34.483 --> 20:38.737
{\an1}THEY DON'T CALL IT
WINDY CANYON FOR NOTHING.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.240
{\an4}OH, NO, BUT NOW
MY PAINTINGS ARE
BLOWING AWAY.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.201
LEAVE THAT TO ME.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.416
{\an5}OH, THEY'RE FLYING.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.416
THEY'RE LIKE KITES!

20:51.500 --> 20:52.626
YEAH!

20:51.500 --> 20:52.626
OOH!

20:52.709 --> 20:54.086
{\an1}LOOK AT THAT.
YOU DID IT, NELLA.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.381
YOU SAVED MY LIFE'S WORK.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.340
WHOA. AND LOOK!

20:58.423 --> 21:01.385
{\an1}ALL THE PAINTINGS
ARE COMING TOGETHER

21:01.468 --> 21:04.388
TO FORM ONE BIG PICTURE.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.557
TRINKET: OF ME!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.351
IT'S AMAZING, CLOD.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.645
OH, IT'S JUST WHAT I DO.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.190
NOW I FINALLY SEE
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.733
[LAUGHTER]

21:16.817 --> 21:19.695
[GASPS] HIS PAINTINGS
ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.447
{\an1}THEY'RE ALL OF ME,
YOU KNOW.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.490
ROYAL SUBJECTS,

21:23.573 --> 21:24.491
AS JUDGE OF
THE ART FAIR,

21:24.574 --> 21:27.369
I'D LIKE TO THANK
ALL OF OUR ARTISTS

21:27.452 --> 21:29.579
FOR THEIR WONDERFUL
PIECES.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.372
BUT THERE IS
ONE ARTIST HERE

21:30.455 --> 21:32.749
WHO DESERVES
SPECIAL MENTION

21:32.833 --> 21:33.667
FOR SUCH OUTSTANDING WORK.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.793
CLOD!

21:34.876 --> 21:35.961

A BRAND-NEW PAINTING

21:41.299 --> 21:44.720
{\an1}THAT WE'D LOVE TO UNVEIL
FOR ALL OF YOU TODAY.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.431
I CALL IT
"BEST BUDDIES."

21:47.514 --> 21:48.473
AMAZING.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.766
A MASTERPIECE.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.102
SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF IT, TRINKET?

21:52.185 --> 21:56.231
{\an1}WELL, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

21:56.314 --> 21:59.609
