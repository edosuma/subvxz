WEBVTT

00:07.760 --> 00:09.479
<i>I need you to go through this</i>

00:09.480 --> 00:11.278
and get me anything
I can use against Tammany.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.714
You are gonna
take on Donovan.

00:12.720 --> 00:13.790
I already did.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.916
Mister Eustace.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.879
I want Corcoran
brought to me, alive.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.873
You wanna live?

00:22.880 --> 00:24.872
- Tell me who sent you.
- Eustace.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.157
You said...

00:28.160 --> 00:30.800
I lied.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.359
The killing can end
or it can continue with you.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.431
Well, you've made
quite a mess, Detective.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.433
Here's to the new
King of Five Points!

00:44.120 --> 00:45.793
<i>Doctor Freeman.</i>

00:45.800 --> 00:47.075
What's wrong?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.390
The president has been assas--

00:50.960 --> 00:52.917
The president
has been assassinated.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

02:28.560 --> 02:32.110
Thank you for allowing us
this private moment.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.680
Thank you
for your generosity.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.356
No amount matches the honor
of serving this man.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.678
A Mister Eustace, sir.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.955
Do make yourself at home.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.350
There's a bar behind us
if you'd like a drink.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.475
I know Detective Corcoran
entrusted your son, Robert,

03:14.480 --> 03:17.120
with the files he stole
from General Donovan.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.510
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.160
<i>You do, and either you help
the organization</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:24.072
by turning over
the Donovan files,

03:24.080 --> 03:26.436
or the organization launches
an all-out war

03:26.440 --> 03:27.556
against the Morehouses.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.949
What constitutes
an all-out war?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.273
Believe it or not,

03:37.480 --> 03:38.675
a man could lose
a whole lot more

03:38.680 --> 03:39.511
than just his money.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.033
Even if the papers
were hidden here,

03:44.040 --> 03:47.317
my son now controls all parts
of the family business,

03:47.320 --> 03:49.960
including the lock boxes.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.677
Well, this could be a day
of liberation...

03:56.880 --> 04:00.237
...for the files
and your balls.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.355
If I find the documents,

04:10.360 --> 04:13.831
I suppose my friends
in the governor's office

04:13.840 --> 04:16.149
may also express interest.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.636
Tammany owns both houses
of the state legislature.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.993
Now I say you would be smart
to start another concern

04:27.000 --> 04:30.710
with preferential treatment
from Tammany.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.190
Liberation.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.396
I was lying
in Armory Square Hospital

05:04.400 --> 05:06.119
after losing
this godforsaken leg--

05:06.120 --> 05:08.157
In a lush, private room,
no doubt.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.153
Young, beautiful nurses
adhering to your every desire.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.834
And the president
himself entered.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.154
You never told us that.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.231
Lincoln studied me
for a moment,

05:19.240 --> 05:20.594
and then he took my hand
and he said,

05:20.600 --> 05:23.513
"Major Morehouse,
men upon crutches

05:23.520 --> 05:26.080
are orators
for this Union,

05:26.080 --> 05:28.549
for your very appearance
speaks louder than tongues."

05:30.040 --> 05:33.238
The man had a craft of words,
that cannot be denied.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.720
A toast!

05:35.760 --> 05:37.274
We three haven't
shared a drink together

05:37.280 --> 05:39.317
since our discharge
from the front.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.677
<i>To the days that made us</i>

05:42.680 --> 05:44.592
and the man
who let us come home.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.270
<i>Through an informant</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:57.636
<i>on Captain Lafayette Baker's
staff,</i>

05:57.640 --> 05:59.677
I have been tracking
the pursuit

05:59.680 --> 06:03.230
of John Wilkes Booth
and David Herold.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.994
<i>I still hold the commission
as Major.</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:09.357
Why do I think I know
where this is going and... no!

06:11.440 --> 06:14.160
Before you dismiss it,
give the matter thought.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.833
With your skills
as a detective

06:15.840 --> 06:16.830
and your knowledge
of the region--

06:16.840 --> 06:19.275
Which is exactly the reason
I'm not goin' south.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.400
Gentlemen,
we have the opportunity

06:24.400 --> 06:28.076
to catch these assassins,
to be heroes.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.117
You are already a hero!

06:30.120 --> 06:33.192
To be forever remembered
by this country.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.395
As an American.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.120
Yes, which is what
you have desired to be called

06:39.120 --> 06:40.315
since you stepped
on these shores.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.991
A train car and waiting horses
can be arranged by nightfall.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.957
You go. My days
are filled with patients.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.832
<i>I was meant to be a rich shit.</i>

06:53.000 --> 06:55.037
Hunting trips upstate,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.319
screwing debutantes
on the beach.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.310
Major--

06:58.320 --> 07:00.312
Instead I joined
a cause and lost a leg

07:02.000 --> 07:04.117
because I was inspired
to preserve the Union

07:04.120 --> 07:05.600
and end slavery.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.277
<i>He has a point.</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:11.797
Matthew, the war's over!

07:12.080 --> 07:13.196
We fought under Lincoln

07:13.200 --> 07:16.113
hoping that we could belong
to this country.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.477
This is not a battle,
but a mission.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.039
<i>You would be...</i>

07:21.040 --> 07:24.192
offering a service
to my country,

07:24.200 --> 07:27.955
and the man who gave me,
my wife and my people

07:27.960 --> 07:30.759
the first strains
of true freedom.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.680
<i>We depart at first light!</i>

07:51.880 --> 07:53.280
Have you forgotten?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.953
This man...

07:56.400 --> 07:58.232
...built your
prosthetic for the wrong leg,

07:58.240 --> 07:59.959
leaving you
with two left feet?!

07:59.960 --> 08:01.679
That's right!

08:01.680 --> 08:05.913
Come now, I couldn't...
I hadn't eaten in three days!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.149
I could hardly see,

08:07.160 --> 08:10.039
much less properly build
an artificial limb.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.477
In a train car,
headed south.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.073
Not sure what you put
in my drink, Major.

08:15.080 --> 08:15.831
Patriotism.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.150
A sense of duty
and courage.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.516
And now we're headed
straight to the very hells

08:21.520 --> 08:23.113
we left behind, huh?

08:23.320 --> 08:26.233
Hey, hey,
what happened to the courage?

08:26.240 --> 08:30.632
Uh, faces, names, towns,
landscapes...

08:32.280 --> 08:33.839
I remember too much.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.433
As do I.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.239
For all the fallen men...

08:40.919 --> 08:42.751
I still think of them most.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.517
Mother and daughter.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.277
Matthew, stop.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.278
It was a different time.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.351
We were different people.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.794
<i>Sirs, from here on down</i>

08:55.800 --> 08:57.678
I would stay away
from the windows.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.796
Why's that?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.269
<i>The original Mason Dixon line
cut through here.</i>

09:02.280 --> 09:05.956
Not everyone is a Yankee
'cause they live in the North.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.991
I see in you a friend
much like, perhaps,

09:42.640 --> 09:45.997
Robert sees
in that downtown detective,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.517
so I've extended myself,
located the files.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.955
However,
in order to obtain them

09:52.960 --> 09:55.759
I'll need something
with which to trade.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.200
Unlike other
downtown characters,

10:02.920 --> 10:04.877
I can give you this.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.759
Add a zero
and we have a deal.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.876
One of the joys
of the City Treasury...

10:29.880 --> 10:32.395
always plenty of zeroes
to go around.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.716
Warmer than New York.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.632
Air smells better, too.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.835
Hey, you know,
when we were last here,

10:46.840 --> 10:50.629
all I could smell was blood
and flesh and death,

10:51.080 --> 10:51.718
and all the screamin'...

10:51.720 --> 10:56.078
...everyone shoutin' or cryin' out
for God or their mother.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.549
I goddamn got used to it.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.233
I never got used to it.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.074
Matthew, does Virginia
feel different

11:02.080 --> 11:03.673
now that you're a free man?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.555
No better than
the last time I rode through here.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.669
I just fear that
too many Virginians

11:09.680 --> 11:11.194
won't know the difference.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.439
Free or not,
I'm still black.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.472
Booth and
Herold were headed south and east.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.597
We suspect one man,
Mister Rutt Waymond,

11:20.600 --> 11:21.716
in aiding and abetting.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.676
Captain Baker requests

11:23.680 --> 11:25.000
you begin your search
at Waymond's.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.959
Very good.
Thank you, Captain.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.395
<i>Major,
keep your wits about you.</i>

11:29.400 --> 11:31.835
There are scattered bands
of rebs wandering the land.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.435
And they ain't all convinced
the hostilities is ended.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.999
Savages.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.515
We should give him
a proper Christian burial.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.512
We don't know
what's lurking in these woods.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.000
We'll do it
on the way back.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.959
He's been there for a while.
A little more time won't hurt.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.474
Forward!

13:20.680 --> 13:24.674
Yup, see that?
A black man.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.197
Get used to it.

13:45.840 --> 13:46.557
Whoa.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.520
I'll head in here,
get directions

13:58.520 --> 14:00.398
to Waymond's house.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.914
If there's any trouble,

14:01.920 --> 14:03.320
you start ridin'
and start shootin'.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.556
Major, your leg.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.517
Morphine was invented
for a reason.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.954
It's a temporary solution.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.431
I could adjust your saddle
to ease the chafing.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.793
You want to dismount here, now?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.949
At the store,
they said Waymond kept bees.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.633
This must be the place.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.751
<i>A night or so ago,</i>

14:53.760 --> 14:56.912
<i>two men rode through this area
on horseback.</i>

14:56.920 --> 14:58.673
One with a broken leg.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.634
Did you happen to see them,
Mister Waymond?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.040
Who's askin'?

15:06.360 --> 15:08.477
<i>We are agents
of the American army.</i>

15:09.040 --> 15:10.838
Who are free to shoot
who we want,

15:11.440 --> 15:13.511
when we want,
no repercussions.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.236
Well you're the only
new faces I seen.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.799
Well, what about
your neighbors?

15:22.040 --> 15:23.315
Ain't heard nothing about 'em

15:23.320 --> 15:25.835
and I haven't been to town
in days.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.830
Huh.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.394
We stopped by Rutledge's
general store

15:30.400 --> 15:31.390
as we passed through,

15:31.400 --> 15:33.596
and Mister Rutledge said
you were in yesterday

15:33.600 --> 15:35.114
buying feed
for your horses.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.234
- What's he doin"?
- Mm... No idea.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.674
<i>You never really know
with him.</i>

15:42.680 --> 15:43.670
Well, that's my property--

15:43.680 --> 15:47.674
So you were in town,
but you weren't.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.432
It's strange
how that could be.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.754
John Wilkes Booth,
David Herold...

15:57.160 --> 15:58.389
You ever hear
those names?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.914
Well, I don't...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.593
What're you...?
Is this all...?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.432
Saw your hives
on the way in.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.874
Good honey season?

16:05.880 --> 16:08.031
If you forget a storm or two.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.839
Good season
usually means room for expansion.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.160
You buildin' new frames?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.594
Been working
all spring, busting--

16:17.160 --> 16:20.915
<i>You see, we're
thinkin' Booth and Herold</i>

16:20.920 --> 16:22.991
spent their night here
in your home,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.437
eatin' your food
and drinkin' your fine whiskey.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.717
Damnit, I told y'all
I've never heard of no such men!

16:28.720 --> 16:30.120
Well, I don't believe you!

16:30.120 --> 16:32.840
Aghhh! Agghhh!

16:35.600 --> 16:38.877
Fine! Sure!
Your boys came through.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.555
<i>But I ain't no sympathizer,</i>

16:42.560 --> 16:44.472
just a hospitality man,

16:44.480 --> 16:47.598
which you Yankees clearly
know nothin' about.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.037
And, yeah,
one of them had a broken leg.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.509
He asked for booze
to ease his pain.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.113
Where'd they head?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.151
God!

17:02.160 --> 17:03.799
- Come on.
- South!

17:03.800 --> 17:08.477
This mornin' they headed south
towards Champlain.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.151
Now, Major, let's get
some honey for that leg compress.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.915
The honey should help quell
the wound's sepsis.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.231
But we'll need to access
proper medical supplies soon.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.278
The proper medical
supplies have been acquired.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.999
Now let's get a move on.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.469
We can be certain the traitor,
Booth, is not resting.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.278
Major...

17:44.720 --> 17:46.279
The contagion here is--

17:46.280 --> 17:49.956
Now come, Matthew,
put my leg back on.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.556
We should have gone east
at the fork, not south.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.552
Matthew, I thought
you knew this land.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.676
I was a slave nearby,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.956
not larking about
the countryside.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.754
Either way,
this should lead to Little River.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.919
Whoa.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.753
Hey there!

18:50.960 --> 18:53.191
<i>Hold it. Whoa, whoa.</i>

19:10.840 --> 19:11.830
<i>Now you boys...</i>

19:13.760 --> 19:14.671
Got the look of Yankees.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.436
Stink of them, too.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.112
<i>You raise those guns,</i>

19:19.120 --> 19:23.672
<i>you die...
Right here and now.</i>

19:30.040 --> 19:31.997
What brings you
'round here?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.673
We have every right
to be here.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.160
<i>We should take
these fine horses.</i>

19:35.720 --> 19:36.949
I'm a New York City detective,

19:38.160 --> 19:39.389
and we're in pursuit
of a fugitive.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.115
John Wilkes Booth?

19:41.520 --> 19:44.194
No. No, we're not army.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.919
It's a bank robber,

19:46.920 --> 19:49.071
an Irishman by the name
of Francis Maguire.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.200
A runty little fellow.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.078
With one good eye.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.517
That so?
Well...

20:01.360 --> 20:02.510
We ain't seen anyone
like that.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.796
So, you say you're a detective?

20:10.120 --> 20:14.672
Like in those
<i>Edgar Allan Poe</i> stories?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.554
Those are among
my favorite tales.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.159
I knew the man himself.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.480
Mister <i>Edgar Allan Poe.</i>

20:27.720 --> 20:28.915
Is that some kinda Yankee lie?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.397
My mother was friends
with him.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.754
When I was a boy,
he came to our house

20:32.760 --> 20:34.752
and read us
<i>"The Tell-Tale Heart"</i> himself.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.074
That's amazing!

20:39.840 --> 20:41.638
A friend of Mister Poe!

20:49.800 --> 20:51.792
You boys look like
you could use a rest.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.914
Why don't you help yourselves
to the cook fire?

20:54.520 --> 20:55.590
Where you headed?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.156
Home.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.833
We're Kentucky boys.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.312
Been fighting nearly
three years.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.640
Glad this damn war
is over.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.270
Good luck.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.351
We'd be stupid
not to take these mounts.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.191
<i>No!</i>

21:10.120 --> 21:13.238
We're Kentuckians,
not Texas horse thieves.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.957
Oh, if we see Booth,

21:18.960 --> 21:22.351
rest assured
we'll shoot him first.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.239
<i>We're soldiers.</i>

21:24.240 --> 21:26.800
Have no use
for cowardly assassins

21:26.800 --> 21:28.393
of any stripe.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.394
Let's move along.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.950
Come on.
Hey, Harvey, come on.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.796
Sure coulda used that horse.
Good lookin' horses.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.556
So it's the true?

21:48.800 --> 21:49.995
You knew <i>Edgar Allan Poe</i> ?

21:52.880 --> 21:54.030
It's true as
chasing a bank robber

21:54.040 --> 21:55.554
named Francis Maguire.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.754
Whoa.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.194
Holy shit.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.672
The battlefield.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.473
When we passed
the Spotsylvania Courthouse,

22:22.600 --> 22:24.193
I wondered.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.277
Christ Almighty,
I can still taste the hell.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.153
We entered the fight
from there,

22:45.160 --> 22:46.879
in those trees,

22:46.880 --> 22:49.190
moved across
and separated from the regiment.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.520
Then the cannon assault
began.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.073
You were shot there,
Major,

22:55.560 --> 22:58.394
then crawled to cover
in that ditch there.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.392
The two of you
followed me.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.437
- And that's when...
- My leg...

23:07.560 --> 23:09.756
You're wrong about the ditch.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.672
I remember this tree.
We took cover behind it.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.670
It's too shallow.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.353
And I recall there
being a rock.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.511
Could have been this dip.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.274
Then again,
my eyes were blind

23:19.280 --> 23:20.714
in the haze of smoke.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.912
Christ, you'd just...

23:25.880 --> 23:28.156
...kill anyone
who was in your way.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.554
I wonder how many of my own men
I sent to death?

23:32.680 --> 23:35.673
The biggest moment
in our lives we were side by side.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.070
Yet we can't agree
upon the location.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.560
<i>At once dreaming,</i>

23:39.560 --> 23:41.836
yet more awake than any man
could possibly be.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.719
I expect these memories
will forever metamorphose.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.960
Freeman, you poet.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.829
<i>Are you trying to say
you've forgotten</i>

23:52.840 --> 23:53.956
where you buried my leg?

24:04.720 --> 24:06.916
Goddamned Battle
of the Wilderness.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.310
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

24:22.320 --> 24:24.835
<i>Maybe they have news.</i>

24:32.800 --> 24:34.632
Our New York boys, eh?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.552
You're late.
The good news is--

24:36.560 --> 24:37.550
Late? We can't be late.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.630
We were sent here
to capture Booth.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.917
Well, we got the bastard.
So you're late.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.639
That can't be! We have orders
from Captain Baker

24:43.640 --> 24:45.757
to capture the assassins
and bring them back alive!

24:46.200 --> 24:47.759
Alive, Matthew,
it's our duty!

24:48.000 --> 24:48.990
<i>Where're you takin' him?</i>

24:49.000 --> 24:50.400
Over to Belle Plain
until further orders.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.350
Is that Herold there?

24:53.360 --> 24:54.555
Indeed.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.040
<i>Son of a bitch is gonna
be swingin'</i>

24:56.040 --> 24:58.350
<i>when I bring his murdering ass
back to Washington.</i>

24:58.360 --> 24:59.350
'Bout ready, boys?

24:59.520 --> 25:00.476
Yes, sir! Yup!

25:01.880 --> 25:02.870
<i>All right, gentlemen.</i>

25:03.760 --> 25:04.830
Lieutenant, wait.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.674
Did the traitor Booth
speak before he died?

25:08.680 --> 25:11.354
Well, he was shot
in the throat,

25:11.360 --> 25:15.957
so the great Shakespearean's
words were barely audible.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.997
What, damnit, did he say?

25:19.200 --> 25:23.353
He said, "Tell my mother
that I died for my country."

25:23.360 --> 25:26.512
Asked one of my men
to put his hands up to his face.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.591
Then he said,
"Useless, useless."

25:29.680 --> 25:31.319
He's a jackass.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.391
But at least he got me
a government reward!

25:33.400 --> 25:34.390
Woo!

25:38.360 --> 25:39.714
"Useless" indeed.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.919
We are the useless ones.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.116
We should have left New York
the morning Lincoln died!

25:45.120 --> 25:46.839
Major, we did the best
we could.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.832
Booth and Herold are captured.
That's all that matters now.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.836
Bullshit!

25:50.120 --> 25:52.032
<i>If we didn't stop to put honey
on my goddamn leg</i>

25:52.040 --> 25:53.394
<i>we would have been
the captors!</i>

25:53.400 --> 25:55.517
Why I thought we three...

26:00.000 --> 26:00.990
There's nothin'
left for us here.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.070
We should start
headin' back.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.276
The Major is not
healthy enough to risk a long ride.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.956
The leg... if gangrene sets in,
anything can happen.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.555
What can we do?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.549
The plantation.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.438
Matthew, no.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.240
It's just a few more miles
from here.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.074
Last I heard Doctor Purvis
still owns the land.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.833
We could get the proper
medical supplies.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.753
<i>A free black,
an Irish Mick,</i>

26:28.760 --> 26:30.479
and a useless white protestant
walk into battle!

26:30.480 --> 26:31.880
Robert, come back here now!

26:31.880 --> 26:34.395
You both realize that
coincidence brought us together,

26:34.400 --> 26:35.834
nothing more!

26:35.840 --> 26:37.513
Freeman,
you seemed useful.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.273
<i>Corky, you Downtown
papist bastard--</i>

26:39.280 --> 26:40.794
Major, you are not yourself!

26:40.800 --> 26:42.917
So you ended up
in the same ditch next to me

26:42.920 --> 26:44.752
and happened to be a good shot.
That makes us friends?

26:44.760 --> 26:46.433
Robert, slow down.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.439
No morphine, no drink.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.591
My leg hurts worse
than the day I lost it!

26:51.600 --> 26:52.920
If only we could get soused

26:52.920 --> 26:53.910
and forget this whole trip
ever--

26:53.920 --> 26:56.116
Your leg is at risk
of gangrene

26:56.120 --> 26:58.271
and needs a cure,
not more numbing!

26:58.280 --> 27:00.476
You are the noble Negro
with all the answers.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.470
<i>What's next?!</i>

27:01.480 --> 27:03.039
Major, you watch your mouth!

27:03.040 --> 27:07.159
Where is the "cure,"
dear Matthew?! Huh?!

27:07.160 --> 27:09.629
At the place
we swore never to return!

27:15.680 --> 27:16.955
There?

27:20.680 --> 27:23.149
We have to go back there?

27:27.160 --> 27:30.153
God.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.314
Everything's fine.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.076
A little closer, Clara,

28:15.200 --> 28:21.913
so we can compare and contrast
the texture and tone.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.916
I am so blessed to have you,
my daughter,

28:26.920 --> 28:29.719
for studies such as this.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.918
Your perfect skin,
alongside--

28:34.160 --> 28:36.152
Who's there?!

28:36.160 --> 28:38.072
Good God, Matthew!

28:39.080 --> 28:41.993
Where'd you come across
this runaway slave?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.593
<i>I was never your slave.</i>

28:43.600 --> 28:45.080
I was a prisoner
bidin' my time.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.640
Now I'm a doctor
healin' a friend.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.873
What in hell is this?

28:49.880 --> 28:53.556
Oh. My field master
inflicted the wounds,

28:53.560 --> 28:54.755
not I.

28:54.760 --> 28:59.755
But isn't it remarkable
what the human body can sustain?

29:05.120 --> 29:08.796
Zeke, you do realize
that by law

29:08.800 --> 29:11.031
Purvis is no longer
your master?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.316
I stay on my own accord.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.800
Purvis pays wages now.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.791
Clara, do you remember me?

29:22.040 --> 29:23.269
<i>Keep away from my daughter!</i>

29:24.680 --> 29:27.673
She hasn't been the same
since those savage Yankee troops

29:28.080 --> 29:29.639
came through here.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.472
You've grown up
since I saw you last.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.913
But not enough
to be a part of this.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.880
<i>I like the way
Zeke's back looks.</i>

29:41.240 --> 29:42.833
His skin is like the bark

29:42.840 --> 29:45.150
on my pretty sycamore
out front.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.151
So...

29:56.320 --> 30:00.599
The baboon's boys
are just more animals.

30:02.120 --> 30:05.272
Direct me to your creasotum,
gauze and plaster right now.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.713
The thing you Yankees
do not understand

30:15.720 --> 30:18.679
<i>is that your side
may have beaten Lee,</i>

30:18.680 --> 30:22.151
<i>but the South is
and always will be,</i>

30:22.160 --> 30:23.799
a separate country!

30:23.800 --> 30:25.234
Shut up!

30:25.240 --> 30:26.640
Corky, give me that bottle!

30:26.640 --> 30:27.630
And your belt.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.677
He'll need somethin'
to bite down on.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.115
This wasn't fun
the first time around.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.680
Major, open your mouth.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.672
<i>Come on, that's enough.</i>

30:37.480 --> 30:38.914
You ready?

30:52.400 --> 30:54.835
Take the right!
Here! Here!

30:57.600 --> 30:59.592
Take the left!

31:00.800 --> 31:02.951
Here! Here! Here!

31:04.480 --> 31:05.709
Move it! Move! Move!

31:11.720 --> 31:14.155
Run! Shoot!

31:16.080 --> 31:17.070
There!

31:27.080 --> 31:29.151
Let's sweep the area.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.277
Meet the boys out front
of the house.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.440
Move.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.710
Matthew?

31:56.720 --> 31:58.632
Oh no!

32:02.200 --> 32:03.475
Gillian!

32:06.640 --> 32:08.472
How did you...?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.473
Oh, shhhh...

32:12.480 --> 32:15.518
You and your mother were trying
to escape the shooting.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.194
Oh, I never meant for this!

32:18.200 --> 32:19.759
For you!

32:19.760 --> 32:23.470
I never meant this for you!
This, this war, this...

32:23.480 --> 32:25.312
My escape, I...

32:26.520 --> 32:29.240
I mean, these were just women,
huh?

32:29.240 --> 32:31.914
<i>Mother and daughter,
innocent civilians.</i>

32:31.920 --> 32:33.036
Christ.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.710
The Major and I were aimin'
in this direction.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.639
I've known
Gillian Purvis since she was born.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.950
And I've known her mother
my entire life.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.758
We had no idea.
If we had...

32:45.760 --> 32:48.673
Heal her.
You have to!

32:50.080 --> 32:53.118
- Oh, I can't.
<i>- I've seen you.</i>

32:53.120 --> 32:55.680
No, not this.
I can't!

32:55.680 --> 32:57.512
At least stabilize her.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.354
You said Purvis was a doctor.
We'll turn her over to him.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.799
Okay, bring your handkerchief.
Hold the wound right here.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.592
Okay.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.796
Shh...

33:14.800 --> 33:17.520
Okay, okay, okay, yeah.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.194
Multiple gunshot wounds...

33:21.920 --> 33:24.355
Only God knows
what the bullets hit.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.078
Within minutes,
at this rate of loss,

33:30.640 --> 33:32.950
she'll bleed out. I...

33:33.200 --> 33:36.352
Then let's take her
to the doctor.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.750
It's beyond anyone's skill.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.879
And the doctor inside
is her father.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.872
If he sees her
like this, I...

33:44.240 --> 33:46.232
Shhh...

33:48.720 --> 33:50.200
Kill me.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.800
Goddamnit, no!

33:55.360 --> 33:57.795
<i>Shhh...</i>

33:59.680 --> 34:01.034
I'll do this.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.355
Matthew.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.313
No, no, no!

34:08.920 --> 34:11.071
It's okay.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.710
No.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.480
It's okay, okay?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.313
<i>Okay.</i>

36:40.120 --> 36:43.716
Corky, Freeman...

36:45.760 --> 36:47.752
What I said to you both about
our meeting being coincidence--

36:48.000 --> 36:49.036
Major, you don't have to.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.469
<i>Let me speak, Matthew.</i>

36:51.800 --> 36:53.519
Yes, we met through
coincidence--

36:53.560 --> 36:56.553
None of us need
to explain anything to each other.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.354
Still, we did not survive
the bloodiest battles

37:00.360 --> 37:01.840
of our nation's history

37:01.840 --> 37:04.036
or remain friends
after being mustered out

37:04.040 --> 37:05.599
because of coincidence.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.111
Coincidence don't make three men
go on a journey,

37:11.240 --> 37:12.993
<i>tracking the nation's
most infamous murderer,</i>

37:14.960 --> 37:18.112
and we wouldn't have found
ourselves back there...

37:20.560 --> 37:21.789
A return to our worst memory.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.516
To a decision
which revealed our sameness,

37:32.040 --> 37:33.952
when we three seemed
the most unlikely of friends.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.079
I am so glad
to be done with war.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.191
Kevin, thank you for coming.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.919
Come, Matthew, I'll give you
a ride to your door.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.910
Oh, no thank you, Major.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.037
I think I'll enjoy
the morning walk.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.076
He's a good man.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.472
Each of us will always
be trying to convince ourselves

38:25.480 --> 38:27.233
that we are good, Corky.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.719
- Corky!
- Hey.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.393
I've been pacin'
Baxter Street for days.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.392
As nervous a boy
as I've ever seen.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.120
Wild Bill sent me to
deliver Tammany Hall's summons.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.271
You're to report to Eustace's
office immediately.

38:48.280 --> 38:51.239
Word is out. They want you
to replace Donovan.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.959
And they won't take no
for an answer.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.756
Do I look like
a ward boss to you?

38:56.760 --> 39:00.151
Kevin,
trust me on this,

39:00.160 --> 39:01.992
you turn them down,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.674
New York is not a place
you will ever live in peace.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.080
What're ya gonna do?

39:07.840 --> 39:09.069
How's Eva been?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.480
Sullivan's had us workin'
around the clock.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.358
We haven't had a night
in The Paradise since you left.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.591
Kevin,
this is serious!

39:14.600 --> 39:16.910
We may win a skirmish
against the organization,

39:16.920 --> 39:18.752
but no way
we win a war.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.796
I'm gonna hit Eva's
and have a drink

39:20.800 --> 39:22.792
while I consider my options.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.077
Join me when you can.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.034
<i>If you need to scream,
you let it out,</i>

39:35.320 --> 39:37.039
<i>especially if the noise
helps you to keep breathing.</i>

39:39.280 --> 39:40.794
<i>Go on.</i>

39:43.720 --> 39:45.951
Sara, I'm here.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.475
Doctor Freeman! Doctor...

39:48.480 --> 39:50.073
That's rosewater.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.437
Leah's been using compresses
to stay relaxed.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.311
The baby's breach.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.073
We've been at this
for 16 and a half hours.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.151
I've been too terrified
to let her push

40:02.160 --> 40:03.799
because I could still feel
the cervix.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.790
If she forces too early,

40:04.800 --> 40:07.076
the baby's neck and head
are in danger.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.400
That's exactly right.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.956
But I think she's ready now.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.317
And the baby's arms
seem to be in the right place.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.640
Feel here.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.030
You're doing fine, Leah.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.760
Matthew and I are gonna
see you through this.

40:24.760 --> 40:28.834
No, I'll take over now, hmm?
You wash up and rest.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.150
Matthew, I've been at this
for 16 and a half hours...

40:31.160 --> 40:33.880
Reason to stay,
not turn tail.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.669
Sara, you have guided this woman
and her child incredibly.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.637
Let the outcome
be my responsibility, hmm?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.359
Sara...

40:43.360 --> 40:45.397
Sometimes nature
does not cooperate.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.199
I'm beginning to think
that Kevin Corcoran

41:04.200 --> 41:06.795
does not take us seriously.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.317
Eva. Eva?!

42:17.040 --> 42:18.838
Eva?!

42:22.640 --> 42:24.632
Eva?!

42:25.305 --> 42:31.393
