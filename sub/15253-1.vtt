00:01.082 --> 00:05.419
<i>And the king was freed,
and the castle was restored,</i>

00:05.487 --> 00:08.756
"and the Frost Queen returned
home once more.

00:08.824 --> 00:10.990
"This time, she was a hero.

00:11.058 --> 00:14.126
"And the Frost Queen
promised her children

00:14.193 --> 00:18.464
that she would
never ever leave them again."

00:18.531 --> 00:19.632
Good story?

00:19.633 --> 00:21.802
I liked it.
The prince was cool.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.038
Yes, he was.

00:23.039 --> 00:25.469
Just like my
little Chuck.

00:25.537 --> 00:28.338
Mom?
Yeah?

00:28.406 --> 00:30.672
Are you going away again?

00:30.740 --> 00:33.075
Just for a few days,

00:33.143 --> 00:35.377
then right back
to you and Ellie.

00:35.444 --> 00:37.344
Good night, honey.

00:41.348 --> 00:43.248
Love you.

00:45.116 --> 00:48.818
Not nearly as much
as I love you.

00:52.589 --> 00:55.224
<i>My mom was a spy.</i>

00:55.292 --> 00:56.826
After she disappeared,
my father spent

00:56.827 --> 00:58.861
the rest of his life
trying to find her.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.830
Ellie and I thought
she left us,

01:01.898 --> 01:03.198
that she just walked away,

01:03.199 --> 01:06.233
but what if we were wrong?

01:06.301 --> 01:07.935
I need your help.

01:07.936 --> 01:11.170
I need you to help me
find my mom.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.406
Holy cow!

01:14.474 --> 01:17.475
I cannot belie
this was beneath your house.

01:17.543 --> 01:18.643
This is nuts!

01:18.644 --> 01:20.810
A secret spy base.

01:20.878 --> 01:23.212
I mean, it's got lasers
and gadgets and...

01:23.280 --> 01:24.647
neatly organized files.

01:24.648 --> 01:26.648
Hey, listen, why don't you just
tell Casey and Sarah?

01:26.716 --> 01:28.750
Because I know what
they're gonna try and do;

01:28.818 --> 01:30.318
they're gonna try
and stop me. They cannot.

01:30.319 --> 01:31.786
I have to find
the truth, Morgan-

01:31.787 --> 01:33.754
why my mom left,
why she never came back.

01:33.821 --> 01:35.322
This is my search.

01:35.323 --> 01:37.424
No. It's our search.

01:37.491 --> 01:39.259
I'm in.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.661
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:40.662 --> 01:42.896
Are you flexing?
What?

01:42.964 --> 01:44.664
No, I was just kinda...
I'm excited.

01:44.665 --> 01:45.765
Okay, good, good.

01:45.766 --> 01:47.499
I can't even tell you how much

01:47.500 --> 01:48.867
I appreciate your help on this.

01:48.868 --> 01:50.601
But listen, one very, very, very
important thing:

01:50.602 --> 01:52.369
we cannot tell anyone,
not a soul.

01:52.370 --> 01:55.204
Not Sarah, not Casey,
not Awesome, not Ellie.

01:55.272 --> 01:56.405
Not Ellie.

01:56.406 --> 01:57.973
I get it, I know.
You promised her

01:57.974 --> 01:59.540
you weren't gonna be a spy,
you know?

01:59.541 --> 02:01.442
So she clearly cannot know about
our little rogue spy team

02:01.510 --> 02:02.810
that we're gonna start here

02:02.811 --> 02:04.911
outside of the government,
secret to the spy world,

02:04.979 --> 02:06.413
team of two,
army of one,

02:06.414 --> 02:07.447
highway to the
danger zone,

02:07.448 --> 02:08.548
live free or
die hard...

02:08.549 --> 02:09.582
Buddy.
Yeah?

02:09.583 --> 02:13.152
This is not the opening
of a TV show.

02:13.219 --> 02:14.319
This is real life.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.987
âª âª

02:22.492 --> 02:25.427
Hey, Sarah, honey, is this the
gun you were looking for?

02:25.495 --> 02:27.362
Yes, thank you. I
got everything, dude.

02:27.363 --> 02:28.595
You ready to go?
She's still here?

02:28.596 --> 02:30.630
Hurry up.

02:30.698 --> 02:32.365
Yeah?

02:32.366 --> 02:34.333
You're the best.
Thank you so much.

02:34.401 --> 02:35.501
Mmm.

02:35.502 --> 02:37.969
A spy mission without me.

02:38.037 --> 02:40.271
Couples do this
all the time, right?

02:40.339 --> 02:42.172
It's just a business trip.

02:42.173 --> 02:43.407
Are you okay with this?

02:43.408 --> 02:45.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine. I'm, you know.

02:45.609 --> 02:46.843
I' got
job interviews

02:46.844 --> 02:48.344
and Morgan and I are
gonna spend quality time.

02:48.345 --> 02:51.146
He signed us up for a go-cart
racing league, so...

02:51.214 --> 02:53.114
Come home soon.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.784
Mmm.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.121
Ugh! I'm gonna be sick.

03:00.122 --> 03:01.822
Come on, Walker, we
got real work to do.

03:01.823 --> 03:03.357
Like se the free world.

03:03.358 --> 03:05.292
Enjoy your retirement,
Bartowski.

03:08.729 --> 03:10.362
What am I, what do I say?
What do we...?

03:10.363 --> 03:12.297
I love you. That's
good. I love you.

03:12.365 --> 03:14.265
I like that. I love you, too.

03:16.301 --> 03:17.668
Be safe, okay?

03:17.669 --> 03:20.971
Nothing is gonna keep me
from coming back to yo

03:21.038 --> 03:22.772
Better not.

03:22.773 --> 03:24.673
Bye.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.577
Mr. Carmichael,
we're all set.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.746
I have our tickets, cloned
passports, money belts.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.748
Let's do this.
Back in the game.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.317
Me and you, real spies.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.285
Sunblock. We need sunblock.

Excuse me.

03:56.168 --> 03:57.734
Very sorry.

03:57.735 --> 03:59.769
Pardon me.

04:24.524 --> 04:26.559
I knew it.
I was right.

04:26.626 --> 04:28.427
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got

04:28.428 --> 04:30.361
all of her missions
when I was a kid.

04:30.428 --> 04:31.595
You kn,

Hey, Morga not now

04:52.714 --> 04:54.614
This is it.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.817
My dad never made it this far.

05:01.421 --> 05:10.485
Okay, Mom, where are you?

05:10.552 --> 05:13.210
And it's notght?

05:13.278 --> 05:17.153
Please tell me
that it's not empty.

05:18.794 --> 05:20.868
I don't get it.

05:20.935 --> 05:23.661
I don't get it. All the intel
led right back here.

05:23.729 --> 05:25.334
No. No, no, no,
there's got to be something.

05:25.335 --> 05:27.055
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a...

05:27.056 --> 05:28.956
a- a secret compartment,
you know?

05:28.963 --> 05:30.302
Or a passageway

05:30.303 --> 05:35.270
or some clue that finally
leads us to my mom.

05:35.338 --> 05:36.858
Yeah.
Come on.

05:36.859 --> 05:39.017
Come on!
Come on!

05:42.112 --> 05:45.992
There's nothing.

05:46.060 --> 05:49.087
Okay, so we didn't
find your mom, but, uh,

05:49.155 --> 05:51.729
maybe we found
a new dumpling house, huh?

05:51.783 --> 05:54.908
All right,
I don'know.

05:55.995 --> 05:58.000
Let's pack it up,

05:58.068 --> 05:59.387
head home.

05:59.388 --> 06:02.015
Fuel up on some dumplings
and start again

06:02.082 --> 06:03.468
from scratch, okay?

06:03.469 --> 06:05.375
Now we can do this, you and I...

06:10.310 --> 06:12.210
All right.

06:13.657 --> 06:15.730
We got close
this time.

06:15.798 --> 06:17.698
I know we're going
to find her.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.548
Oh, Chuck.

06:36.347 --> 06:42.898
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

07:15.364 --> 07:16.697
Talk to me, buddy,
you know?

07:16.698 --> 07:18.165
Let it out.
You want to cry?

07:18.166 --> 07:20.066
Go for it. I got
two good shoulders.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.167
What are we doing?

07:21.168 --> 07:23.104
Why are we even bothering
looking for my mom?

07:23.171 --> 07:25.073
My dad ruined his life
trying to find her.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.809
She could have come back any
time she wanted to, you know?

07:27.877 --> 07:29.076
We're easy to find.

07:29.077 --> 07:30.244
Her, not so much.

07:30.245 --> 07:32.145
I'm done, man.
I- I think I'm done.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.648
Listen, you had to try, right?

07:34.716 --> 07:36.616
Don't move, Chuck.

07:36.617 --> 07:37.951
Get over here!

07:37.952 --> 07:39.252
Morgan. Morgan, Morgan.
Coming, coming.

07:39.253 --> 07:42.321
Give me them keys.

07:42.389 --> 07:44.823
Yeah, here you go, sir. Here
they are. Here are your keys.

07:44.891 --> 07:46.891
Just don't, please don't
shoot me or Chuck.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.526
Look, if this is has anything
to do with my mom

07:48.527 --> 07:50.428
or-or Albania or Tangiers,

07:50.496 --> 07:52.830
or that-that cafe in Budapest which
was... Oh, that was not even...

07:52.898 --> 07:55.332
Anyway, the point is we have
explanations for all of that.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.300
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.536
I'm a repo man!

07:59.604 --> 08:01.072
Repo man. Morgan?

08:01.073 --> 08:02.273
Right.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.508
We haven't made a payment
in four months.

08:04.576 --> 08:05.976
The car cost $900.

08:05.977 --> 08:08.212
Yeah, but we're $43,000
in debt. I was gonna...

08:08.280 --> 08:10.415
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What? What?
43 what?

08:10.483 --> 08:12.616
$43,000 debt, and that's...
that's above the CIA money

08:12.684 --> 08:14.584
you had saved up
because being a spy,

08:14.585 --> 08:15.852
apparently is really expensive.

08:15.853 --> 08:18.120
Why didn't you...
why didn't you tell me?

08:18.188 --> 08:19.788
Well, you were so busy
looking for your mom...

08:19.789 --> 08:22.424
Enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.

08:22.492 --> 08:24.159
Just, uh, Chuck,
give him a little,

08:24.160 --> 08:25.793
you know what I mean,
Intersect style.

08:25.794 --> 08:27.361
I don't do kung fu anymore,
buddy.

08:27.362 --> 08:28.829
You got some chop-socky, boy?

08:28.830 --> 08:30.730
No, no chop-socky here, sir.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.265
Fresh out
of chop-socky.

08:32.267 --> 08:34.167
Take the car.

08:34.168 --> 08:36.068
That's what I thought.

08:37.037 --> 08:39.770
My advice: get a job!

08:39.839 --> 08:42.073
Working on it.

08:43.509 --> 08:46.777
You know, Chuck, this does
not happen to real spies.

08:55.017 --> 08:57.618
I'm cornered. What do I do?

08:57.686 --> 08:59.820
MAN
Use the device.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.694
Make a move
and you're dead, Marko.

09:05.695 --> 09:07.862
Please, make a move.

09:24.043 --> 09:26.477
I thought you said
the EMP was a fake.

09:27.579 --> 09:29.913
I was wrong.

09:29.981 --> 09:31.047
Beautiful, isn't it?

09:31.048 --> 09:32.115
Volkoff Industries'

09:32.116 --> 09:34.316
handheld EMP generator.

09:34.384 --> 09:38.085
Will fry every electric circuit
in a three-klick radius.

09:38.153 --> 09:39.987
Volkoff's upping the ante.

09:39.988 --> 09:42.022
The building's elevators
are knocked out.

09:42.090 --> 09:44.458
Mr. Volkoff's agents
will be here in minutes.

09:44.525 --> 09:46.792
You're trapped.

09:46.860 --> 09:49.195
Put down your guns.

10:07.177 --> 10:09.278
You know, he really
should be here.

10:09.346 --> 10:10.513
Chuck's the Intersect.

10:10.514 --> 10:12.115
We could use him on
a mission like this.

10:12.116 --> 10:14.016
I hate cracking into
computer systems.

10:14.017 --> 10:16.184
Well, he made a promise
to his sister.

10:16.252 --> 10:17.452
Chuck doesn't want
to be a spy

10:17.453 --> 10:18.986
and have to lie
about it, too.

10:18.987 --> 10:21.187
Your boyfriend needs
some big boy pants. He's a spy,

10:21.255 --> 10:22.722
he's good at it.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.990
I know, Casey.
You miss him, too.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.325
What? I don't miss him.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.293
Freeze now!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.231
Oh, by the way,
good idea to bring the chutes.

10:33.298 --> 10:35.198
Thank you.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.434
âª âª

10:52.782 --> 10:55.182
Yes, Chuck.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.184
Yes. Nice. I like this.

10:57.251 --> 10:58.551
But l-less back.

10:58.552 --> 10:59.786
Maybe just
kind of a...

10:59.787 --> 11:01.154
Hold that. Hold that.

11:01.155 --> 11:02.989
Right there, this whole
sleepy confusion thing.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.591
That's digital sex
right there, my friend.

11:04.592 --> 11:06.058
Morgan, what are you doing?

11:06.059 --> 11:07.959
I'm putting the spark back
in your relationship, dude.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.294
Trust me.
Sarah's going to love these.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.196
What? Good. Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind,

11:11.264 --> 11:12.297
I'll hit the peck deck
a little bit.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.498
Oh, and, uh...

11:13.499 --> 11:15.233
put baby oil, please.

11:15.234 --> 11:16.534
Lube it up.
What?

11:16.535 --> 11:17.968
Ba-ba... What?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.603
Lube it up. Lube
it. No, no, no.

11:19.604 --> 11:21.204
Grease it up. Whatever
you're doing, please stop.

11:21.205 --> 11:22.439
Okay. Okay.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.073
I know you're down
about your mom, Chuck.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.743
Let's you and I have a little
talk right now, man-to-man.

11:26.810 --> 11:29.679
Okay. Okay. Man-to-man talk.

11:29.747 --> 11:31.681
What are you doing
in my room with baby oil?

11:31.748 --> 11:33.648
More importantly,
you and Sarah, okay?

11:33.650 --> 11:35.283
'Cause every morning
you're waking up missing her,

11:35.284 --> 11:36.351
acting like a sad sack.

11:36.352 --> 11:37.619
I mean, I-I understand
a little bit,

11:37.620 --> 11:39.353
you know, you're-you're
stuck in this

11:39.354 --> 11:41.287
long-distance relationship right
now that's short on intimacy.

11:41.355 --> 11:42.488
That's okay. It's all right.

11:42.489 --> 11:44.724
But what you need to do
is open your mind

11:44.792 --> 11:46.459
to what sex
truly is.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.360
It's sexting.

11:49.629 --> 11:51.863
Yeah. Short for sext writing.

11:51.931 --> 11:53.965
It's intimacy for people
in your situation.

11:54.032 --> 11:55.699
Sexting.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.500
Sex... sexting.

11:57.501 --> 11:58.968
Sexting.
Sexting.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.436
Sexting. Buddy.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.371
Now that the terrible ids
are t of the way,

12:02.439 --> 12:04.006
I told Ellie
about the job hunt,

12:04.007 --> 12:06.241
and she's already lined up
five interviews for today.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.408
Okay.

12:07.409 --> 12:08.710
I'll grab our bus passes.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.712
But, uh, remember, um, sexting?

12:10.780 --> 12:13.080
Oh, yeah, sex talk?
No, not going to happen.

12:13.148 --> 12:15.015
Good luck
on the job hunt.

12:15.016 --> 12:17.250
Fine. Do it myself.

12:20.755 --> 12:22.622
<i>I am so glad you could come in.</i>

12:22.623 --> 12:24.057
You know,
with a rÃ©sumÃ© like this

12:24.058 --> 12:25.858
and a degree
from Stanford, uh...

12:25.859 --> 12:27.559
it's astounding you haven't
been snatched up already.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.994
Snatch me up.

12:28.995 --> 12:30.895
I'm 100% snatchable.

12:30.896 --> 12:33.097
I'm sorry, I don't use
the word "snatch" very often

12:33.165 --> 12:34.399
for a myriad
of reasons.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.501
Relax.hy are you so nervous?

12:36.568 --> 12:39.603
Uh... you know,
I'm not normally.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.172
I- I'm normally... I'm
normally a smooth operator.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.274
Like Sade.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.776
But today has
been a strange,

12:46.844 --> 12:48.811
uh, day of interviews.

12:48.879 --> 12:51.513
Really? Well, how?

12:51.581 --> 12:53.915
Well, for starters,
um, have you ever

12:53.982 --> 12:55.950
had anyone fall asleep
in an interview?

12:58.186 --> 12:59.520
Um, just after that,

12:59.521 --> 13:01.855
the person sitting in
your position got a little ill.

13:04.191 --> 13:06.325
Just after that, the interviewer

13:06.393 --> 13:08.293
started going
into convulsions...

13:09.629 --> 13:11.230
The last interview
I just came from,

13:11.231 --> 13:13.499
they-they told me they
were going for a cup of coffee,

13:13.566 --> 13:15.300
<i>and then they never came back.</i>

13:15.301 --> 13:18.804
I mean, how long does it take
to get coffee?

13:18.871 --> 13:20.372
That's really crazy.

13:20.373 --> 13:22.207
Yeah.
Well, um...

13:22.208 --> 13:24.576
I think, Chuck, that I have
some good news for you.

13:24.644 --> 13:25.811
Good.
Yeah.

13:25.812 --> 13:28.146
How would you like to join...?

13:28.214 --> 13:30.682
I thought I told them
to hold my calls.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.050
I- I, uh... I... I don't think

13:32.051 --> 13:33.951
it's a good idea for
you to answer that.

13:33.953 --> 13:35.587
Hello.

13:35.588 --> 13:37.488
Yes.
It's about you.

13:38.124 --> 13:40.159
What?

13:40.226 --> 13:42.126
Is... is everything okay?

13:43.930 --> 13:45.830
What's happening? Who is that?

13:48.234 --> 13:50.702
Uh...

13:50.770 --> 13:53.772
unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski,
the position's been filled.

13:53.839 --> 13:54.939
What's happening? Who was that?

13:54.940 --> 13:56.407
And I'm going to have security

13:56.408 --> 13:57.808
escort you from the building.

13:57.809 --> 13:59.609
Wait. I'm s...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.445
Hang on a second. What did I do?

14:01.446 --> 14:03.146
Who was that
on the phone?

14:03.147 --> 14:05.180
Perhaps I could explain
whatever the situation is.

14:05.248 --> 14:06.982
Gentlemen, this is completely
uncalled-for.

14:06.983 --> 14:08.583
<i>Look on the bright side, Chuck.</i>

14:08.584 --> 14:10.484
<i>The bus has much more legroom
than the hatchback.</i>

14:11.987 --> 14:13.921
There's a conspiracy
against me.

14:13.989 --> 14:16.690
I don't know. I... always feel
that way after a bad interview.

14:16.758 --> 14:17.757
Except, with me,
the conspiracy

14:17.758 --> 14:19.158
has been going
on a lot longer.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.292
You know? Like, kindergarten.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.926
Morgan, what am I
supposed to do now?

14:21.927 --> 14:23.894
These were Ellie's best leads.

14:23.961 --> 14:26.061
Where am I going to find a job?

14:28.630 --> 14:30.962
Well, there's...
always one place.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.897
Where?

14:36.233 --> 14:38.235
I can't believe
it's back, Chuck.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.480
âª âª

14:57.120 --> 14:58.787
It's beautiful.

14:58.788 --> 15:01.256
I can't believe how
fast they rebuilt it.

15:04.193 --> 15:06.093
Oh...

15:06.861 --> 15:08.761
...my...

15:11.262 --> 15:12.295
Lord.

15:12.296 --> 15:13.430
Welcome to the Buy More.

15:13.431 --> 15:15.365
We're not
open yet, but...

15:15.433 --> 15:18.035
but we are currently
accepting rÃ©sumÃ©s.

15:18.102 --> 15:19.269
Are you interested?

15:19.270 --> 15:21.137
For what?

15:21.138 --> 15:22.639
A job.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.940
Maybe.

15:23.941 --> 15:25.708
What-what, uh, types

15:25.709 --> 15:27.108
of positions are available?

15:27.109 --> 15:28.976
I'm sure the store manager
can help you with that.

15:28.977 --> 15:30.544
Have at it.

15:30.545 --> 15:32.278
Good luck.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.147
So nervous.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.815
Do you want me to show you
around the store?

15:36.883 --> 15:38.450
Yes, please.
That would be delightful.

15:38.451 --> 15:39.685
Should I hold your hand?

15:39.686 --> 15:41.621
No, you should not.
Okay. Lead on.

15:45.057 --> 15:46.957
Um...

15:48.158 --> 15:50.058
Hello.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.961
My name is Chuck
Bartowski, and, uh...

15:54.028 --> 15:56.863
it's funny, uh...
I- I used to work here.

15:56.931 --> 15:59.465
You still do work here.

16:07.973 --> 16:09.206
Hello, Chuck.

16:09.207 --> 16:11.107
Welcome back.

16:19.203 --> 16:21.772
Beckman had kittens
when I told her about the EMP.

16:21.839 --> 16:23.306
She wants us to find out
where Volkoff's

16:23.307 --> 16:25.173
building it so we can
blow the place up.

16:25.174 --> 16:26.408
Another mission?

16:26.409 --> 16:27.742
We've been at it for months,

16:27.743 --> 16:29.911
and I haven't seen Chuck in...
forever.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.579
There's something else.

16:31.580 --> 16:33.180
Beckman wants Chuck
to come down here,

16:33.181 --> 16:35.515
take a look at the EMP,
see if he flashes.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.350
Chuck is a civilian now.

16:37.351 --> 16:40.053
We can't force him
to be a spy, can we?

16:40.120 --> 16:43.189
You might want to tell
Beckman that yourself.

16:45.992 --> 16:47.926
Oh, Chuck.

16:47.994 --> 16:49.927
As you can see,
we spared no expense

16:49.995 --> 16:51.630
recreating
the Buy More.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.531
Um, yeah, uh, General,

16:53.599 --> 16:55.099
I- I appreciate
the tour and all...

16:55.100 --> 16:57.634
It's no longer simply
a retail store.

16:57.702 --> 17:01.403
It's now a full-fledged
CIA-NSA substation.

17:01.471 --> 17:03.471
We can patch into

17:03.539 --> 17:06.106
security cameras
all over the world.

17:06.174 --> 17:07.641
Satellite relays-

17:07.642 --> 17:10.476
NORAD, NASA,
Strategic Air Command.

17:10.544 --> 17:13.310
Hit that red button,
we go to DEFCON 1.

17:16.714 --> 17:17.881
Is that, uh...
is that really

17:17.882 --> 17:19.982
the safest place to put that-
out in the open?

17:20.050 --> 17:21.650
There's a new laser-based
security system.

17:21.651 --> 17:22.851
General, this is crazy.

17:22.852 --> 17:24.952
You realize this is crazy.
No, it's not.

17:25.020 --> 17:28.088
After the success of
Operation Bartowski,

17:28.155 --> 17:30.789
the president made
you a priority.

17:30.857 --> 17:32.724
<i>I beg your pardon.
The-the-the president president?</i>

17:32.725 --> 17:34.625
Like, the actual...

17:35.862 --> 17:37.296
You're being totally serious.

17:37.297 --> 17:39.398
General, I am out
of the spy game.

17:39.465 --> 17:40.866
You're out
when I say you're out.

17:40.867 --> 17:43.237
If memory serves,
you actually said,

17:43.305 --> 17:45.622
"Chuck, you are out
of the spy game."

17:45.690 --> 17:47.099
I changed my mind.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.146
You're back. Discussion over.

17:49.214 --> 17:51.581
And don't think you're going
to find another job.

17:53.050 --> 17:54.984
Why...?

17:55.051 --> 17:56.351
You... you... you.

17:56.352 --> 17:58.019
That was you on the phone,
wasn't it?

17:58.020 --> 18:00.221
You tanked my interviews,
didn't you?

18:03.725 --> 18:06.526
Oh. Hi, Sarah.

18:06.594 --> 18:07.927
Back in town?
Chuck, listen to me.

18:07.928 --> 18:09.428
You do not have to be a spy.

18:09.429 --> 18:11.397
Oh, no, no.
I know. Yeah.

18:11.464 --> 18:12.698
Beckman just offered
me a position,

18:12.699 --> 18:14.599
and I turned her down.

18:15.101 --> 18:16.401
How did she react?

18:16.402 --> 18:18.302
Well, she...

18:19.238 --> 18:21.138
Chuck, hello?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.849
Hey.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.817
Hey.

18:37.286 --> 18:39.020
That went well, I think.

18:39.021 --> 18:40.255
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:40.256 --> 18:42.090
I should have called,
but we just got in.

18:42.091 --> 18:43.791
No, hey, it's fine-
'cause you're here,

18:43.792 --> 18:45.125
and I'm here, and...

18:45.126 --> 18:46.593
and I miss you a lot.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.062
Mmm. Mmm.

18:49.130 --> 18:50.530
Mmm. I missed you, too.

18:50.531 --> 18:52.865
This is the mission that
just won't end. I get it.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.233
It's important work, okay?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.401
But you're here now at least
for a little while, right?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.269
Few weeks?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.138
Days? Hours?
Enough sap.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.106
Hey, Sarah, what... Let's take
a look at the mission at hand.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.074
What are you...?
Flash.

19:08.778 --> 19:10.143
Gah! Hah!

19:10.144 --> 19:11.444
Well?

19:11.445 --> 19:14.111
Thanks, Casey.

19:14.178 --> 19:16.779
EMP- uh, manufactured
in Venezuela

19:16.847 --> 19:18.179
at the Corta Verona
facility,

19:18.180 --> 19:19.680
which is
a subsidiary

19:19.681 --> 19:20.781
of Volkoff Industries.

19:20.782 --> 19:22.115
Who's Volkoff? Don't tell me.

19:22.116 --> 19:24.649
Alexei Volkoff-
arms dealer, recluse.

19:24.717 --> 19:27.252
He's like the Russian
Howard Hughes.

19:27.319 --> 19:29.053
We've been chasing after him
for months,

19:29.054 --> 19:30.521
and with that single flash,

19:30.522 --> 19:32.589
we might just be able
to take him down.

19:32.656 --> 19:33.756
Good to have you back.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.857
Oh, I'm not staying.

19:34.858 --> 19:36.958
I think he misses you.
Oh, I know he does.

19:38.859 --> 19:39.959
This is nuts, man.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.259
The Buy More is being run
by the CIA. Amazing.

19:42.327 --> 19:44.131
Which would make you
a spy, huh?

19:44.132 --> 19:46.032
You are very
perceptive, Mr. Grimes.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.445
Guilty.

19:47.446 --> 19:50.587
I got to say, the new Castle
is pretty freaking sweet.

19:52.023 --> 19:53.923
And it's nice to be back
down in here with u.

19:54.892 --> 19:56.491
Chuck, can we talk?

19:56.492 --> 19:57.791
Of course. Anytime.
About what?

19:57.792 --> 19:59.359
Well, I know
this is awkward,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.928
but, um... I just have to
ask about the picture.

20:03.363 --> 20:05.597
What, uh... what picture?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.500
Hi-oh.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.735
Chuck, do you want
to sext with me?

20:10.736 --> 20:12.405
Ah! No! I don't...

20:12.406 --> 20:13.906
I mean...

20:13.907 --> 20:16.274
I... No.

20:16.342 --> 20:18.209
No, no.
No, uh, this...

20:18.210 --> 20:19.677
this isn't my idea.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.345
Cleary not my idea.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.513
This was Morgan's doing.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.648
Well, don't worry.

20:23.649 --> 20:25.083
I... I thought it was cute.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.917
Here's the thing-
I don't know if you know this,

20:26.918 --> 20:28.385
but, uh, I actually
was an agent myself

20:28.386 --> 20:30.053
for a little while
last year.

20:30.054 --> 20:32.022
What if we got together,
maybe...

20:32.089 --> 20:34.057
show each other
a few moves?

20:34.124 --> 20:36.659
You know, I... I have a trip
to Thailand in the morning.

20:36.726 --> 20:38.293
Mmm. Sure. Sure.

20:38.294 --> 20:39.695
It's a new mission.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.630
Oh, of course.
It's the life of a...

20:41.698 --> 20:43.631
I could show you something
right now.

20:43.699 --> 20:45.266
Really? Yeah.
You know.

20:45.267 --> 20:47.801
So, six/nine-month anniversary.

20:47.869 --> 20:49.102
What do you think?

20:49.103 --> 20:51.037
Well, I-I have to go away again,

20:51.105 --> 20:53.405
but when I come back,
we will celebrate in style.

20:53.473 --> 20:55.674
Fantastic. No phones necessary.

20:55.741 --> 20:56.841
No.
Unless you want.

20:56.842 --> 20:58.276
No. I don't know
what that means.

20:58.277 --> 21:00.177
Uh, forget
I even said anything.

21:02.448 --> 21:03.615
Hey, hey, hey.
What-what...

21:03.616 --> 21:05.149
what is.. what is...
what is this?

21:05.150 --> 21:06.450
The emblem? That's Volkoff's.

21:06.451 --> 21:08.819
He is not afraid
to advertise.

21:08.886 --> 21:11.054
Well, I have to go debrief
with Beckman and Casey,

21:11.121 --> 21:13.022
but we'll talk later?
Yeah, great.

21:22.231 --> 21:25.199
Whoa.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.934
New Buy More rules.

21:26.935 --> 21:28.503
Slides and
trap doors

21:28.504 --> 21:30.004
and the new
superspy/Nerd Herder, Greta.

21:30.005 --> 21:31.805
Be still, my
beating heart.

21:31.806 --> 21:33.473
She digs me. I can tell.

21:33.474 --> 21:35.374
Morgan.
Uh-huh?

21:35.409 --> 21:37.410
We need to get the car back.

21:39.279 --> 21:41.179
Uh, with the creepy guy?

21:43.283 --> 21:45.251
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:45.319 --> 21:47.320
Again, tell me
why we're here.

21:47.388 --> 21:49.423
I mean, this menu's linked
to an arms dealer?

21:49.490 --> 21:52.225
Look, I thought the last
mission was a bust, okay?

21:52.293 --> 21:55.028
But the menu could be the link
that brings us to my mom.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.197
Maybe she was after Volkoff
just like Casey and Sarah.

21:57.264 --> 21:59.866
Okay, listen, I get the menu-
we get out of here quietly.

21:59.934 --> 22:01.834
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.

22:02.169 --> 22:04.069
There it is.

22:06.339 --> 22:08.239
You young,
oversexed,

22:08.274 --> 22:10.475
underworked kids.

22:10.543 --> 22:13.644
You don't mess with
a repo man. Not ever!

22:13.712 --> 22:15.545
Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
Mr. repo man, sir.

22:15.546 --> 22:17.346
We are not here
to mess with you.

22:17.347 --> 22:18.814
We just... Morgan,
get the... get the...

22:18.815 --> 22:19.881
get the menu!

22:19.882 --> 22:21.016
Oh, repo man,
Excuse me for one second.

22:21.017 --> 22:22.317
I'm just going to
just, very slowly...

22:22.318 --> 22:23.651
I'm just going to kind of...

22:23.652 --> 22:24.685
He's just reaching...
Here we go.

22:24.686 --> 22:25.952
Here we go. Perfect.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.821
Please, this is all we want
and then we're leaving.

22:27.822 --> 22:29.757
We're out of your hair.
You want a menu, for what?

22:29.825 --> 22:32.093
Chinese.
Dumplings.

22:32.161 --> 22:34.128
Oh, yeah?

22:34.196 --> 22:36.096
A good place?

22:38.132 --> 22:39.833
No. It's...
No. No.

22:39.834 --> 22:41.935
I like good Chinese.

22:42.002 --> 22:43.936
Hard to find.

22:44.004 --> 22:45.438
Hand it over.

22:45.439 --> 22:47.973
Buddy, you remember how we got
out of that jam in Tangiers?

22:48.041 --> 22:49.508
Tangiers?
Think it'll work?

22:49.509 --> 22:50.809
Tangiers? What does that mean?

22:50.810 --> 22:53.144
It means that we need to run!
Run! RunRun! Run!

22:53.211 --> 22:56.847
Damn you!

22:56.915 --> 22:59.616
I love dumplings.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.251
It's really weird.

23:02.318 --> 23:04.686
Most of these are just your
run-of-the-mill dishes,

23:04.753 --> 23:07.422
but a few of these I haven't
even heard of before.

23:07.489 --> 23:11.191
Which ones? Which dishes?

23:11.258 --> 23:13.393
For example, this.

23:13.461 --> 23:15.461
Shimira Chicken.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.468
Ah, Shimira.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.837
Okay, Shimira is actually
a nav system for spy subs.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.738
This is not a menu
for ordering food.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.440
This is a menu
for ordering weapons.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.675
Why would your mom have that?

23:31.743 --> 23:34.277
Let's call and find out.

23:34.345 --> 23:38.147
Use your dad's
encrypted phone.

23:38.215 --> 23:40.115
Okay.

23:40.116 --> 23:42.016
Let's see here.

23:46.387 --> 23:48.187
Who is this? Identify.

23:48.188 --> 23:51.390
This is Carmichael.
I work for the Ring.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.759
The Ring was eliminated.

23:53.826 --> 23:56.929
We are an offshoot
of the Ring.

23:56.996 --> 24:00.131
The New Ring.

24:00.199 --> 24:03.067
I'm the head of security.

24:03.135 --> 24:04.969
I'll need to see your
organization firsthand

24:04.970 --> 24:06.503
if we agree to work.

24:06.504 --> 24:09.039
Then you'll have to come to
Volkoff Industries in Moscow.

24:09.107 --> 24:10.440
Moscow, Russia.

24:10.441 --> 24:11.975
Not a problem.

24:11.976 --> 24:13.943
The New Ring has
very deep pockets.

24:14.011 --> 24:15.311
We're going to Russia.

24:15.312 --> 24:18.147
Okay. I'm going to have to sell
my Millennium Falcon.

24:18.215 --> 24:21.483
And God bless you.

24:21.550 --> 24:22.951
Yes, I'm here.

24:22.952 --> 24:24.819
Just tell me when and where.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.853
We have a jet on standby.

24:31.426 --> 24:34.561
<i>Okay, so we I.D.
Volkoff's facility</i>

24:34.629 --> 24:36.563
and then we can take it out
with a single drone strike.

24:36.630 --> 24:40.332
Have you ever been in
a long-distance relationship?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.834
No.

24:43.835 --> 24:45.969
I either leave or they die.

24:46.037 --> 24:48.271
I'm going to the head.

25:00.116 --> 25:02.016
âª âª

25:34.378 --> 25:36.446
WOMAN
Please fasten your seat belts.

25:36.514 --> 25:38.682
We're heading into a bit
of turbulence.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.552
Release the gas.

25:43.553 --> 25:45.885
I'll reroute the flight
to Moscow.

26:16.130 --> 26:18.397
Where are we?

26:18.465 --> 26:22.967
Desolation, frostbite.

26:23.034 --> 26:25.169
Must be Russia.

26:25.236 --> 26:28.304
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.

26:28.372 --> 26:30.772
I'm glad you could
finally make it.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.573
Take a load off.

26:32.574 --> 26:34.341
Relax.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.242
And think about
all the terrible things

26:36.310 --> 26:38.245
I will do to you.

26:38.312 --> 26:39.580
We're pros, Marko.

26:39.581 --> 26:41.248
Your methods won't
work on us.

26:41.249 --> 26:44.184
Remember, I work
for Volkoff.

26:45.753 --> 26:48.388
I must break you.

27:05.234 --> 27:08.202
Remember the plan.

27:08.270 --> 27:10.670
We have to access the
Volkoff computer system

27:10.738 --> 27:12.538
to see what they
have on my mom.

27:12.539 --> 27:14.039
Does that make sense?
Completely.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.841
Although I think my face
is still frozen.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.344
Hello.

27:18.412 --> 27:19.679
We're with the Ring.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.180
The New Ring.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.449
This is Charles Carmichael.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.550
I'm Michael Carmichael.

27:26.785 --> 27:28.685
So, if you
wouldn't mind...

27:30.054 --> 27:32.490
Frigid in here, as well. Wow.

27:32.558 --> 27:34.862
The plan was for me
to be Carmichael

27:34.930 --> 27:37.233
and you to be Sven,
my mute assistant.

27:37.301 --> 27:38.768
See, here's the thing.

27:38.769 --> 27:39.969
These people respect a beard.

27:39.970 --> 27:41.838
And that whole
assistant thing... I don't know.

27:41.839 --> 27:43.840
I see us more as
brothers. Is that so?

27:43.907 --> 27:45.575
Okay, okay, fine.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.376
What parents in their right mind
would name their child Michael

27:48.444 --> 27:50.077
if their last name
was Carmichael?

27:50.078 --> 27:51.943
That's crazy. What were
your parents thinking?

27:51.944 --> 27:54.544
<i>What were our parents thinking?</i>

27:54.612 --> 27:56.745
You know. It's what people in
the movie business call improv.

28:04.419 --> 28:06.319
Nice photo.

28:11.692 --> 28:13.592
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.169
Okay.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.637
I know where
the server is.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.470
It's actually not far
from where we are.

28:28.471 --> 28:30.905
If my father's codes still work,
we should be able to get in.

28:30.973 --> 28:32.307
What do you think?

28:32.308 --> 28:34.409
Uh, maybe you drop a little
Intersect style on these fools.

28:34.477 --> 28:35.979
Karate chop your way in.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.181
I will hide behind
the receptionist desk.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.550
You know, that, or we
could just run really fast.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.251
Tangiers? Here?

28:42.252 --> 28:44.152
Tangiers. Exactly.

28:44.154 --> 28:45.454
Ah, could work.

28:45.455 --> 28:47.356
The case.

28:47.423 --> 28:49.323
One, two, three. We go.

28:52.027 --> 28:53.694
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

28:53.695 --> 28:55.595
Come on. Come on.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.700
Come on.

29:00.768 --> 29:02.668
I almost got it.

29:08.441 --> 29:12.863
Oh. I've never run so fast
in so many layers before.

29:14.918 --> 29:16.753
Game time.

29:16.754 --> 29:18.654
Yup.

29:22.692 --> 29:24.192
This place is nuts.

29:24.193 --> 29:26.093
Yeah, it's a Cold War relic,
buddy.

29:29.197 --> 29:32.098
Oh, dude,

29:32.165 --> 29:34.065
what is this?

29:34.068 --> 29:35.236
Morgan,

29:35.237 --> 29:36.604
that's an EMP,

29:36.605 --> 29:38.538
so I wouldn't
touch that.

29:38.606 --> 29:41.307
This is an EMP?
Yes, it is.

29:41.375 --> 29:43.310
No touching, Morgan.

29:43.377 --> 29:45.345
Got ya. Got ya.

29:45.412 --> 29:48.147
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.

29:48.214 --> 29:50.048
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.949
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.186
Your phone. Yeah, I'm
kind of busy right now.

29:56.187 --> 29:58.254
Oh.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.424
Sarah.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.525
She's sexting you.
Not now, Morgan.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.861
Got ya.

30:05.928 --> 30:08.829
Go on... my lady.

30:10.864 --> 30:12.298
What does he say?

30:12.299 --> 30:13.933
He thinks we're sexting.

30:13.934 --> 30:16.035
What?

30:16.103 --> 30:18.037
What does that
even mean?

30:19.139 --> 30:21.639
SOS. SOS.

30:21.707 --> 30:24.975
Skin on skin.

30:25.043 --> 30:26.543
Yes, please.

30:26.544 --> 30:28.411
Oh, come on.

30:28.412 --> 30:30.312
Filthy.

30:31.448 --> 30:33.217
He still thinks we're sexting.

30:33.218 --> 30:34.752
You kiss your mom
with those thumbs?

30:34.753 --> 30:36.720
Oh, my God!

30:36.788 --> 30:37.954
Oh, my God.

30:37.955 --> 30:39.087
Daddy likes.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.421
Oh, you're in trouble.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.322
Daddy likes.

30:42.724 --> 30:45.359
Hey, someone's coming.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.961
We're inside Volkoff.

30:47.962 --> 30:49.927
Subbasement four.
Tell him! Okay.

30:49.995 --> 30:51.428
Got it.

30:51.429 --> 30:52.496
Bypassed their security. I'm in.

30:52.497 --> 30:53.797
Awesome. Awesome.
Anything?

30:53.798 --> 30:55.698
Well, there's nothing
coming up with her name,

30:55.733 --> 30:56.900
but I'm checking aliases,

30:56.901 --> 30:58.334
missions my dad thought
she went on

30:58.335 --> 31:00.235
or weapons she was after.

31:01.971 --> 31:03.505
Hang on.

31:03.506 --> 31:05.406
Hang on.
Wait a minute. Frost.

31:06.008 --> 31:07.575
Frost.

31:07.576 --> 31:08.743
The Frost Queen.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.644
My mom used to tell me a stories

31:10.712 --> 31:12.879
when I was a kid
about the Frost Queen.

31:12.947 --> 31:14.147
That can't be it.

31:14.148 --> 31:15.815
Well, either way,
let's download it

31:15.816 --> 31:17.482
and get out of
here. It's encrypted.

31:17.483 --> 31:18.849
It's encrypted.

31:18.850 --> 31:21.551
But I have a program
that can hack it,

31:21.619 --> 31:23.186
and then we can
download it.

31:23.187 --> 31:25.421
Right. Uh, quickly.

31:30.925 --> 31:32.125
Wait a minute.

31:32.126 --> 31:33.526
Oh, crap.

31:33.527 --> 31:34.693
What?

31:34.694 --> 31:36.094
It's Sarah, but it's...

31:36.095 --> 31:37.795
I- I thought
she was sexting, dude.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.129
She's here

31:39.130 --> 31:41.965
with Casey,
and they're in trouble.

31:42.032 --> 31:43.667
Dude, what do we do?
Call Beckman.

31:43.668 --> 31:46.237
I'll call Beckman, or CIA,
or the Marines, because

31:46.305 --> 31:48.205
someone's got to save 'em.
Who's gonna save 'em?

31:51.849 --> 31:54.286
We are.

31:58.099 --> 32:01.234
Enough with the toes.

32:02.969 --> 32:04.937
No one's coming.

32:05.004 --> 32:07.171
I would love
nothing more

32:07.239 --> 32:10.775
than to put bullets

32:10.842 --> 32:12.842
in both your heads.

32:12.910 --> 32:14.343
Yeah, go ahead and do it.

32:14.344 --> 32:16.244
Don't jabber. Just do it.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.750
The problem is you're not the
two agents I'm looking for.

32:23.818 --> 32:26.286
In the past six months,
two CIA agents

32:26.353 --> 32:28.356
have gotten closer
to Volkoff Industries

32:28.424 --> 32:31.126
than any other spy.

32:31.194 --> 32:32.594
They're ghosts.

32:32.595 --> 32:33.929
They expertly use

32:33.930 --> 32:35.464
public transportation
to avoid

32:35.465 --> 32:37.365
being tracked.

32:38.702 --> 32:40.602
So tell me...

32:42.171 --> 32:44.273
...who are these master spies?

32:46.176 --> 32:48.110
No idea.
Never seen 'em.

32:48.178 --> 32:50.245
Morgan, this way.

32:50.313 --> 32:52.014
Back, back, back, back,

32:52.015 --> 32:53.915
back, back, back.

32:58.554 --> 33:00.555
MAN We've got them
- they're in the building.

33:00.623 --> 33:01.690
They're here.

33:01.691 --> 33:02.890
They must have come for you.

33:02.891 --> 33:04.791
Well,

33:04.826 --> 33:06.526
that's their
first mistake.

33:06.527 --> 33:10.863
This entire building...
is a trap.

33:12.466 --> 33:15.969
So, buddy,
how rusty is your kung fu?

33:16.036 --> 33:19.105
I haven't used it in months.

33:19.173 --> 33:21.041
Great.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.477
So... do you want to speak

33:23.544 --> 33:25.044
to your friend?

33:25.045 --> 33:26.045
Chuck, what's going on?

33:26.046 --> 33:28.113
What are you doing here?

33:28.180 --> 33:29.447
Sarah, I know you must have

33:29.448 --> 33:31.081
a lot of questions
for me right now,

33:31.082 --> 33:32.349
and I promise
I will explain everything later.

33:32.350 --> 33:33.383
Listen, you've got
to flash, okay?

33:33.384 --> 33:34.851
You've got to get out of here.

33:34.852 --> 33:36.653
I've heard enough. No,
please, this is a big mistake.

33:36.654 --> 33:37.654
He's not a spy.

33:37.655 --> 33:39.555
Kill them.
No, please, no.

33:51.334 --> 33:53.268
Well, it all seemed

33:53.336 --> 33:56.170
a bit anticlimactic.

33:56.238 --> 33:59.306
I'm gonna tear you
limb from limb from limb.

33:59.374 --> 34:00.540
Okay, I got it.

34:00.541 --> 34:02.441
Somebody please shoot this guy?

34:02.909 --> 34:04.676
CHUCK
Hello?

34:04.677 --> 34:07.512
Uh... yes, who is it?

34:07.579 --> 34:09.547
Look, you clearly have
no idea who I am

34:09.614 --> 34:12.349
since you only sent ten
of your men to take care of me,

34:12.417 --> 34:13.717
so let me break it down for you:

34:13.717 --> 34:15.719
if you touch one hair
on Sarah's head,

34:15.786 --> 34:17.786
I will do to you
what I've just done to your men.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.021
Do you understand?

34:19.022 --> 34:21.790
I'm coming down
there right now.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.225
Scary enough?

34:24.226 --> 34:26.159
I'm scared.
I was scared when you...

34:26.228 --> 34:27.460
You are not rusty
at all, Chuck.

34:27.462 --> 34:29.129
You are limber.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.498
I suggest
you start running...

34:31.565 --> 34:33.399
right about now.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.300
Follow me.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.380
Aah... that hurts.

34:50.415 --> 34:51.648
I'm so out
of spy shape.

34:51.649 --> 34:53.549
What the hell are
you doing here?

34:56.053 --> 34:57.987
Saving your lives, okay? Let's
just call it that for now.

35:00.891 --> 35:01.891
I'm good.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.326
Cut me free.

35:03.327 --> 35:04.728
I got some Russians to kill.

35:04.729 --> 35:08.233
Not yet- there's one more
thing I have to do.

35:09.336 --> 35:11.272
I'm waiting for you,

35:11.340 --> 35:14.243
and I don't like
to wait.

35:14.311 --> 35:16.211
MAN Boss, the
Americans have escaped.

35:22.251 --> 35:24.017
Chuck, why are we here?

35:24.018 --> 35:26.719
What, the computer?
This is what you came here for?

35:26.787 --> 35:29.421
Look, Sarah, I have
to tell you the truth.

35:29.489 --> 35:31.055
I took over my father's
search for my mom.

35:31.056 --> 35:32.990
She's a spy, she is a
spy, I-I don't know.

35:33.058 --> 35:35.158
I thought I could find her, I could
save her, I could bring her home.

35:35.226 --> 35:36.626
You should have told me.

35:36.627 --> 35:38.327
You would have tried to stop
me. Of course I would have.

35:38.328 --> 35:39.895
I don't want you
to get hurt.

35:39.896 --> 35:41.163
Sarah, I have to do this.

35:41.164 --> 35:43.098
This is my mom, okay, I
need to know the truth.

35:43.166 --> 35:45.768
No lying-
that was our rule.

35:45.835 --> 35:49.303
In all fairness, I was just,
you know, keeping a secret.

35:49.371 --> 35:50.370
I wasn't lying.

35:50.371 --> 35:52.771
New rule:
no secrets, no lies.

35:52.839 --> 35:55.806
Starting now.

35:55.807 --> 35:56.806
Great, you've made up.

35:56.807 --> 35:58.407
Now, how do we get
out of here?

35:58.408 --> 35:59.675
MARKO
You can't get out.

35:59.676 --> 36:00.710
This is a living building,

36:00.711 --> 36:02.679
totally automated.

36:02.747 --> 36:04.314
The security system
is activated.

36:04.315 --> 36:07.284
If you die, you die.

36:07.351 --> 36:09.385
That sounds ominous.

36:09.453 --> 36:11.353
Hope the file
was worth it, Chuck.

36:11.388 --> 36:13.555
We're sitting
ducks in here.

36:19.851 --> 36:21.317
Sorry, Mom.

36:21.318 --> 36:23.284
Chuck, what are you doing?

36:23.352 --> 36:24.619
If I set off the EMP,

36:24.620 --> 36:26.520
it disables the building
and we walk out of here.

36:26.554 --> 36:28.020
But, Chuck, the computer.

36:28.021 --> 36:29.154
You'll lose the file.

36:29.155 --> 36:30.722
You might never
find your mom.

36:30.723 --> 36:32.623
Yeah, well,
it's not worth losing you.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.392
Any of you.

36:37.762 --> 36:38.762
Yeah, we get it.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.663
Pull the trigger.

36:46.602 --> 36:48.770
Okay, great,
great plan.

36:48.838 --> 36:50.004
Now what?

36:50.005 --> 36:51.339
Now we employ

36:51.340 --> 36:54.408
the best commie rifle ever
invented- Comrade AK-47.

36:57.746 --> 37:00.080
âª âª

37:09.921 --> 37:12.356
Move it. Move it.

37:12.424 --> 37:14.057
Everybody alive?

37:14.058 --> 37:15.925
I'm okay, I'm okay,
a little cold, but...

37:15.926 --> 37:17.593
Anyone that matters?

37:17.594 --> 37:19.628
Where's the getaway car?

37:35.041 --> 37:38.508
Happy anniversary?

37:38.576 --> 37:40.577
Happy anniversary.

37:49.448 --> 37:50.948
So that's it.

37:50.949 --> 37:53.452
That's the whole story.

37:53.519 --> 37:56.155
Well, I'm just peeved you
didn't ask us for help.

37:56.222 --> 37:58.557
I'm sorry.

37:59.659 --> 38:01.560
Will you help me find my mom?

38:04.263 --> 38:06.163
Yes.

38:07.133 --> 38:09.101
Yes, of course.

38:09.169 --> 38:10.602
But, Chuck, you know
what this means.

38:10.603 --> 38:12.237
You're going to have
to rejoin the Agency

38:12.238 --> 38:13.772
and be a spy.

38:13.773 --> 38:15.107
I know.

38:15.108 --> 38:17.709
The question is:
do we tell Beckman about my mom?

38:17.777 --> 38:20.580
Mm-mm.
No, not yet.

38:20.647 --> 38:22.115
Chuck, what about your sister?

38:22.116 --> 38:24.217
What are you going
to tell Ellie?

38:27.421 --> 38:29.422
I have to tell her the truth.

38:31.558 --> 38:35.194
I have to tell her
that I am a spy.

38:37.431 --> 38:39.732
âª âª

38:44.336 --> 38:45.903
Chuck.

38:45.904 --> 38:47.071
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

38:47.072 --> 38:48.806
Oh, that's okay.

38:48.807 --> 38:50.707
How are you?

38:52.144 --> 38:53.744
The interview
didn't go well?

38:53.745 --> 38:55.613
No, none of 'em, really,

38:55.614 --> 38:57.748
but there's something
that I have to do, Ellie.

38:57.816 --> 38:59.183
It's okay, Chuck.

38:59.184 --> 39:00.951
I know.

39:00.952 --> 39:02.886
What?

39:02.954 --> 39:04.955
I saw the new Buy More.

39:06.191 --> 39:09.793
Uh, right, yeah,
I did get a job there.

39:09.861 --> 39:11.595
Ellie, I'm not-
that's not what I...

39:11.596 --> 39:12.596
It's okay, Chuck.

39:12.597 --> 39:13.596
It's a job.

39:13.597 --> 39:14.664
Those are really
hard to come by

39:14.665 --> 39:17.133
these days, so...

39:17.201 --> 39:18.968
My turn.

39:18.969 --> 39:21.572
Let's sit down.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.507
Okay.

39:23.508 --> 39:25.509
What's up?

39:27.445 --> 39:29.379
I'm pregnant.

39:29.447 --> 39:32.082
What?

39:32.149 --> 39:34.551
Are you-
what, seriously?!

39:34.618 --> 39:37.120
I- I was going to wait
until Devon got home,

39:37.188 --> 39:38.922
but I, I saw you and
I had to tell you.

39:38.923 --> 39:40.823
Oh, my God.

39:41.459 --> 39:43.761
Oh, my God, I'm so- oh,
my God, I'm hugging you.

39:43.862 --> 39:46.331
Uh, I- am I-
did I hurt the baby?

39:46.398 --> 39:48.132
I hurt the child.

39:48.133 --> 39:49.534
Chuck.

39:49.535 --> 39:51.469
Oh, my God,
that's amazing.

39:51.536 --> 39:53.304
I'm really happy
right now, Chuck.

39:53.305 --> 39:56.341
I mean, I'm
starting a family-

39:56.408 --> 39:59.077
a new family- and you
have Sarah and you're safe

39:59.145 --> 40:04.048
and... just I'm really
so happy right now.

40:07.186 --> 40:09.787
<i>I couldn't tell her, not now.</i>

40:09.855 --> 40:11.923
She doesn't want me
to be a spy,

40:11.991 --> 40:15.526
but my dad gave me
this mission to find our mom,

40:15.594 --> 40:16.928
to know the truth.

40:16.929 --> 40:18.829
I can't not do this.

40:18.830 --> 40:20.231
I have to do this.

40:20.232 --> 40:23.434
That's not being a spy,
that's being a brother.

40:26.704 --> 40:30.607
I cracked into the deep
database for your mom

40:30.675 --> 40:33.477
and this is all
I could find.

40:33.545 --> 40:35.445
Look at the top
of the page.

40:41.554 --> 40:43.488
She was captured?

40:43.556 --> 40:46.525
Yeah, and there's
nothing else after that.

40:48.194 --> 40:51.595
This whole time, Ellie and I
thought that our mom left us

40:51.663 --> 40:53.731
because she didn't care
about us, but she was taken.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.369
Are you going to tell Ellie?

40:59.406 --> 41:01.407
No.

41:02.609 --> 41:05.077
No, not yet.

41:05.145 --> 41:06.979
If my mom is still alive,

41:06.980 --> 41:09.415
I'm going to find her
and bring her home.

41:11.084 --> 41:14.253
Why did you bring me here?

41:14.321 --> 41:16.589
I found out some interesting
information about you.

41:16.656 --> 41:19.925
Someone is
looking for you.

41:19.993 --> 41:21.927
Who?

41:21.995 --> 41:23.895
Your family.

41:30.002 --> 41:31.937
Have you told Volkoff anything?

41:32.004 --> 41:34.606
No, I told him nothing.

41:34.674 --> 41:37.109
That's good.

41:37.177 --> 41:39.077
That is...

41:39.412 --> 41:41.714
...very, very good.

42:08.274 --> 42:10.473
Please.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.109
I have a family.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.982
So do I.
