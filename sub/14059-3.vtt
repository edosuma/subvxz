I like it natural.
It only works with Gi Gi.

39:04.678 --> 39:08.248
I tell ya, I'm not a‐‐
not a man without her.

39:08.314 --> 39:11.652
I‐‐ I gotta get her back.
I'm gonna get her back.
No, no, no! No! No!

39:11.718 --> 39:15.255
Get her back!
Hugh, that would be
a huge mistake!

39:15.321 --> 39:17.724
Gi Gi stole your mojo.

39:17.791 --> 39:20.627
You go back to her,
she's just gonna steal more.

39:20.694 --> 39:23.029
She'll suck it
right of your body.

39:23.096 --> 39:24.965
You'll have
negative mojo.

39:25.031 --> 39:28.068
Believe me,
there is only one way
you're gonna get it back.

39:30.003 --> 39:32.238
How?

39:32.305 --> 39:35.008
You've gotta
reclaim your power.

39:37.611 --> 39:40.146
What the hell
are you talkin' about, Doug?

39:40.213 --> 39:41.347
This is simple
law of physics.

39:41.414 --> 39:43.249
Gi Gi stole
something from you.

39:43.316 --> 39:46.653
Right? You gotta
replace it with something
equal and opposite,

39:46.720 --> 39:49.890
yet bigger
and more powerful.

39:49.956 --> 39:53.059
Like a hundred and fifty
million dollars.

39:53.126 --> 39:55.061
Bayou Hills!

39:55.128 --> 39:56.997
Deal of the century!

39:57.063 --> 40:00.867
A lasting legacy
to the genius
that is Hugh Panetta!

40:00.934 --> 40:05.338
That's you! The source
of all your power.
[ Laughing ] No, no!

40:05.405 --> 40:06.940
Gi Gi's Delilah
to your Samson.

40:07.007 --> 40:11.945
She's Kryptonite
to your super, uh... mojo.

40:12.012 --> 40:15.315
And you must avoid her
at all costs.

40:15.381 --> 40:17.651
Otherwise, pffht.

40:17.718 --> 40:20.186
‐ "Pffht"?
‐ Yeah.

40:22.222 --> 40:25.325
‐ I don't know.
‐ Well, I do know.
I do know, Hugh.

40:25.391 --> 40:27.528
You gotta get some meaning
in your life,

40:27.594 --> 40:31.565
the kind that hard‐focused,
nonstop, 100‐hours‐a‐day‐type
work's gonna do.

40:31.632 --> 40:34.334
Gi Gi?
Gi Gi is an impediment.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.270
She's an obstacle.
She's a cancer.

40:37.337 --> 40:40.040
You must excise her
from your life.

40:42.242 --> 40:44.444
She's toxic.

40:45.478 --> 40:47.380
Wow.

40:47.447 --> 40:52.452
Most people wouldn't have
the balls to talk to me
about my wife like that, Doug.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.121
Well‐‐

40:55.188 --> 40:58.959
You really are my friend,
aren't you? Hmm?

40:59.960 --> 41:04.330
I love you.
I love you, Doug.

41:04.397 --> 41:07.267
And I'm not even
that drunk anymore.

41:07.333 --> 41:10.003
Thank God I puked, huh?
Yeah.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.556
Hi.

41:29.623 --> 41:31.858
I'm Dahlia Malloy,

41:33.126 --> 41:35.028
and I'm, uh‐‐

41:36.229 --> 41:38.098
I'm a parole violator.
