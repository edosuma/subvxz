00:00.501 --> 00:01.893
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.894 --> 00:03.062
Mary: We gather together

00:03.063 --> 00:06.803
with the unification
of the two crescent bloodlines.

00:06.804 --> 00:08.964
Hayley will share
here unique gifts

00:09.456 --> 00:10.418
with her pack.

00:10.419 --> 00:12.027
Let Jackson have Hayley.

00:12.028 --> 00:14.775
His reign
will be short-lived.

00:14.776 --> 00:18.052
Klaus: Jackson, I invite you
to live here.

00:18.053 --> 00:19.274
Welcome to the family.

00:19.275 --> 00:21.647
Well, the wolves are unified,
hope is safe,

00:21.648 --> 00:23.394
so in the interest of
maintaining the peace,

00:23.395 --> 00:26.308
I have decided to join
Marcel in algiers.

00:26.309 --> 00:27.443
- Rebekah.
- Freya.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.114
Tell our brothers
I'll be coming to see them.

00:29.115 --> 00:31.848
Gas has pervaded every
single room in this home.

00:31.849 --> 00:33.162
Good-bye, brother.

00:34.924 --> 00:39.037
Helbred bransar, belaste
herte, begin panet.

00:39.038 --> 00:40.506
I will not leave this body

00:40.507 --> 00:42.791
until I find a way
to bring you back.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.548
Hayley: Have you told
Marcel that you're you?

00:45.549 --> 00:47.659
I thought I'd hold off
on that for the moment.

00:48.593 --> 00:51.631
[Music playing]

00:58.436 --> 01:01.176
Enough already
with the family squabbling.

01:01.177 --> 01:02.445
Come on, Nik.
Even you can see

01:02.446 --> 01:04.813
how the situation
has become awkward.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.418
There's nothing
awkward about it.

01:06.419 --> 01:09.067
Hayley and hope belong in the
compound, where they're safe.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.196
As much as I would like
Elijah's help to kill Finn,

01:11.282 --> 01:13.093
if his delicate
sensibilities are offended

01:13.094 --> 01:14.864
by the presence
of Hayley's new husband,

01:14.865 --> 01:17.372
then he's welcome to continue
sulking across the river.

01:17.373 --> 01:19.213
As I have explained to you repeatedly,
brother,

01:19.214 --> 01:22.384
my presence here in algiers
is purely to assemble allies,

01:22.385 --> 01:24.053
and given all the
enemies we have afoot

01:24.054 --> 01:25.524
in the form of wayward siblings

01:25.525 --> 01:27.360
and ancient,
maniacal aunt dahlias,

01:27.361 --> 01:29.468
I would think that you
would applaud my efforts.

01:29.469 --> 01:31.105
Well, if it's my
applause you seek,

01:31.106 --> 01:32.776
you shouldn't have dashed
off in a bloody huff.

01:32.777 --> 01:34.645
Rebekah: All right.
Can you two at least try

01:34.646 --> 01:36.649
and stay focused on what's
best for hope's safety?

01:36.650 --> 01:38.118
I would like nothing more.

01:38.119 --> 01:39.320
I am doing exactly that.

01:39.321 --> 01:41.589
See? You're on the same team.

01:41.590 --> 01:44.793
Conflict resolved,
crisis averted.

01:58.871 --> 02:00.200
Excuse you, too.

02:21.918 --> 02:23.386
Are you two looking
for something

02:23.387 --> 02:25.228
besides a smack in the jaw?

02:25.314 --> 02:27.103
You will die for
what you've done.

02:27.104 --> 02:28.103
Unh!

02:30.798 --> 02:32.774
Stupid bloody magic!

02:33.271 --> 02:34.818
Unh!

02:41.247 --> 02:42.535
There's more of them on the way.

02:42.536 --> 02:45.076
We should probably go.

02:45.077 --> 02:47.787
Rebekah.

02:47.788 --> 02:49.621
How did you know?

02:49.622 --> 02:50.788
Can we talk about that later?

02:50.789 --> 02:52.326
We don't have all day.

03:01.835 --> 03:03.335
Freya: Don't worry.

03:03.336 --> 03:05.850
I've made sure no one
can come in here.

03:05.851 --> 03:09.813
I'm not worried. I'm just
impatient for a reunion

03:09.814 --> 03:12.978
with the brothers
that tried to kill me.

03:12.979 --> 03:16.182
Freya, now that I'm healed,
I need power.

03:16.183 --> 03:18.250
Now our father's still in
the tomb where I left him.

03:18.251 --> 03:20.850
I think it's time that
I go back and I channel him.

03:22.586 --> 03:24.724
Finn.

03:24.725 --> 03:28.832
I need a moment
alone with him first.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.502
It's been a thousand years.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.170
He doesn't even know
I'm still alive.

03:34.171 --> 03:36.640
Believe me, Freya,
that is for the best.

03:36.641 --> 03:38.922
He's a monster.

03:38.923 --> 03:40.845
He wasn't a monster to me.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.179
Well, he changed
after you were taken.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.351
Freya, I spent years
hoping that he would

03:45.352 --> 03:48.226
go back to being himself,
but he never did,

03:48.227 --> 03:50.191
and from what I understand,
over the centuries,

03:50.192 --> 03:52.188
he's grown far worse.

03:52.189 --> 03:54.363
Just a few minutes,
my sweet munin.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.199
[Sighs]

03:57.200 --> 04:01.037
I suppose you'll want time
with our mother, as well.

04:01.038 --> 04:05.662
Esther gave me away.

04:05.748 --> 04:08.010
She is nothing to me.

04:08.011 --> 04:10.545
Let her rot.

04:10.546 --> 04:12.915
Klaus: It's time to use
our werewolf army.

04:12.916 --> 04:16.254
Finn and the woman who
calls herself my sister

04:16.255 --> 04:17.853
are in this city.

04:17.855 --> 04:19.890
The wolves can help us
pinpoint their location.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.460
No. We need all hands
on deck here with hope.

04:22.461 --> 04:25.307
Nik, you can compel humans
to track your enemies.

04:25.393 --> 04:26.763
Do my ears deceive me,

04:26.764 --> 04:29.976
or did you just give me
an order in my own home?

04:29.977 --> 04:31.633
This ain't
about your ego, Klaus.

04:31.634 --> 04:32.869
It's about what's best
for that little girl.

04:32.870 --> 04:36.316
How dare you question my
intentions for my daughter!

04:36.317 --> 04:38.745
Jack...

04:38.746 --> 04:40.445
Klaus is right.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.651
Finn's body disappeared
from the morgue,

04:42.652 --> 04:43.985
which means that either
he's powerful enough

04:43.986 --> 04:45.620
to heal from that explosion,

04:45.621 --> 04:49.128
or Freya's powerful
enough to save him.

04:49.129 --> 04:50.497
Either way,
we're not finding them

04:50.498 --> 04:53.541
unless we send
our best people out there.

04:53.542 --> 04:55.938
But I'm sure you and
all your merry men

04:55.939 --> 05:00.144
will find them posthaste.

05:00.145 --> 05:01.966
Just to be clear.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.951
I'm giving this order
because Hayley is asking.

05:04.952 --> 05:08.555
Don't think for one second
I take orders from you.

05:15.128 --> 05:17.397
You haven't spoken
a word for 30 minutes.

05:19.989 --> 05:23.029
31. Fine.
I'll answer for you.

05:23.030 --> 05:26.403
"Thank you
for rescuing me, Marcel.

05:26.404 --> 05:28.119
"It's so good of you
to still care,

05:28.205 --> 05:30.269
even though no one
told you that I was back."

05:30.270 --> 05:32.605
I asked them not to.

05:32.606 --> 05:34.674
There she is.

05:34.675 --> 05:36.206
Why?

05:36.207 --> 05:38.044
It's complicated.

05:38.045 --> 05:39.417
You think?

05:39.418 --> 05:42.085
How did you find me anyway?

05:42.086 --> 05:44.187
I knew you were you,
I knew you were up to something,

05:44.188 --> 05:46.021
so I followed you, ok?

05:46.022 --> 05:47.589
And it's a good thing
that I did.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.058
That market is bad news.

05:49.059 --> 05:51.101
The treme witches are not
friendly to outsiders.

05:51.187 --> 05:53.395
What were you doing there?

05:53.396 --> 05:56.263
I was looking for anything that
could help boost my magic.

05:56.264 --> 05:58.199
I promised Kol I'd find
a way to bring him back,

05:58.200 --> 05:59.968
and I can't do that as
an amateur hour witch.

05:59.969 --> 06:02.002
Ok. You need to be more careful.

06:02.003 --> 06:03.736
I can take care of myself.

06:03.737 --> 06:05.671
All evidence to the contrary.

06:05.672 --> 06:08.441
Don't be condescending just
because you got to play hero

06:08.442 --> 06:10.242
for one tiny moment.

06:10.243 --> 06:16.166
One tiny, saved your life
from certain death moment.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.618
Are you all right?

06:17.619 --> 06:19.654
Barely. The attackers
knew me, Elijah,

06:19.655 --> 06:24.090
not me me but this,
her, whoever she is.

06:24.091 --> 06:25.459
They want her dead.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.295
We will find them and show them
why their anger is unwise.

06:28.296 --> 06:29.796
You don't want to mess
with that crowd, all right?

06:29.797 --> 06:31.264
We want answers,
we need to ask Josephine Larue.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.864
She serves as matriarch to the
covens outside the quarter.

06:33.865 --> 06:35.065
She'll know who wants
Rebekah dead.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.268
How can you be sure?

06:36.269 --> 06:38.472
She bankrolls
the Fauline cottage.

06:38.473 --> 06:39.642
She'll know exactly who you are

06:39.643 --> 06:41.245
and why you were
locked up in there.

06:41.246 --> 06:43.214
And what if she wants to
lock me right back up?

06:43.215 --> 06:44.649
I won't go back to
that horrid place.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.050
The two of you go
and see what you can find

06:46.051 --> 06:47.283
about this body you now possess,

06:47.284 --> 06:48.584
and I shall pay a visit
to Josephine.

06:48.585 --> 06:50.019
A warning to you.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.202
You are not who you once were.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.526
This body's all too vulnerable.

06:54.527 --> 06:56.629
Elijah.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.663
Josephine is
an eccentric old bat

06:58.664 --> 07:00.668
with no love for vampires.

07:00.669 --> 07:02.601
Your charms might not work
as well as you think.

07:02.602 --> 07:05.004
My charms are quite adaptable,
Marcellus,

07:05.005 --> 07:06.837
let me assure you.

07:15.104 --> 07:17.450
Our brothers probably have
spies all over the place

07:17.451 --> 07:18.718
looking for us.

07:18.719 --> 07:20.387
I won't be long, Finn.

07:20.388 --> 07:22.089
I promise.

07:22.090 --> 07:26.026
Freya, are you sure
you want to do this?

07:26.027 --> 07:28.894
All right. This is not
the man that you remember.

07:29.368 --> 07:31.281
He is still my father.

07:53.417 --> 07:57.934
Sinn vaka augas hniga.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.814
Sinn vaka augas hniga.

08:02.815 --> 08:07.026
Sinn vaka augas hniga.

08:07.027 --> 08:11.735
Sinn vaka augas hniga.

08:16.908 --> 08:19.075
[Gasping]

08:25.134 --> 08:28.631
Gia: Can't we just bring wine
or coffee cake, bundt cake,

08:28.632 --> 08:30.434
any kind of cake?

08:30.435 --> 08:32.904
From what I can gather,
miss Larue

08:32.905 --> 08:35.274
was something of a musical
prodigy in her youth.

08:35.275 --> 08:37.344
The way to her heart is with
the music she loves the most...

08:37.345 --> 08:41.413
Beethoven, "sonata
number 9, opus 47."

08:41.414 --> 08:45.153
How about I bring my laptop,
speakers, add a drumbeat?

08:45.154 --> 08:47.157
The promise of your performance is
what has opened the door for us.

08:47.158 --> 08:49.761
If this fails,
the life of someone I care for deeply

08:49.762 --> 08:52.196
will be in jeopardy,
and that would displease me immensely.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.796
Shall we move, please?

08:53.797 --> 08:56.075
No. Why don't you make
both our lives easier,

08:56.076 --> 08:59.639
just compel someone
from the symphony?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.332
My darling Gia,
you are an artist

09:02.333 --> 09:06.576
far more gifted than anyone
from any local symphony.

09:06.577 --> 09:09.672
Unfortunately,
miss Larue despises vampires,

09:09.673 --> 09:12.800
and we need to show her that
our community's comprised of a...

09:12.801 --> 09:16.988
A different breed with
a new sophistication.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.788
Sophisticated, huh?

09:19.789 --> 09:23.525
I suppose you want me
in a dress.

09:23.526 --> 09:25.730
We should adapt
for our audience, yes.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.863
And you... dark suit on the
left side of your closet

09:28.864 --> 09:33.040
or identical dark suit
on the right?

09:33.041 --> 09:35.448
I prefer the one in the middle,
thank you so much.

09:35.449 --> 09:40.910
Man, if anyone ever needed a
woman to mess his life up a bit...

09:43.588 --> 09:46.627
Right. Uh, your girl
actually went and...

09:46.628 --> 09:47.630
She did.

09:47.631 --> 09:48.868
Married another...

09:48.869 --> 09:50.296
Another guy.

09:50.297 --> 09:52.540
Um, look.
For what it's worth,

09:52.541 --> 09:55.277
I thought Marcel and I
had a thing,

09:55.278 --> 09:59.051
but that didn't work out.

09:59.052 --> 10:03.457
We may not be in the same boat,
but it's the same ocean.

10:08.363 --> 10:10.800
Aiden: So what are we
now... errand boys?

10:10.801 --> 10:11.935
I told you Finn's powerful.

10:11.936 --> 10:13.070
If we're gonna find him,

10:13.071 --> 10:14.705
we need numbers,
strength, and speed.

10:14.706 --> 10:17.407
Wait, Jack. These new
abilities of ours,

10:17.408 --> 10:20.006
people are already talking about
what they can do individually,

10:20.007 --> 10:22.144
and they need to feel respected,
not like cannon fodder.

10:22.145 --> 10:23.714
We're gonna lose good men...

10:23.715 --> 10:26.751
We're not gonna lose
anybody if you stay alert.

10:26.752 --> 10:29.752
Hunt Finn down as a pack,
catch him off guard.

10:29.753 --> 10:34.659
The sooner we find this freak,
the sooner we can all relax.

10:34.660 --> 10:39.563
And, Aiden, I appreciate
your concern,

10:39.564 --> 10:43.014
but why don't you let
me worry about the pack?

10:47.777 --> 10:51.746
It's surprising how little
he values your input,

10:51.747 --> 10:54.193
especially since it was
you who led the wolves

10:54.194 --> 10:57.086
during his self-imposed exile.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.456
What do you want, Klaus?

10:59.457 --> 11:04.793
Merely to offer advice that may
save the lives of good men.

11:04.794 --> 11:08.969
My brother Finn is not entirely
sane, but he is clever.

11:08.970 --> 11:12.038
If you approach him en masse,
he will see you coming,

11:12.039 --> 11:14.872
and he will destroy
you en masse.

11:14.873 --> 11:20.081
Instead, be strategic,
move quietly.

11:20.082 --> 11:22.216
I'll handle the rest.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.956
Oh, nothing says manly like
buying a matching tea set.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.457
The good news is
this guy who's coming,

11:33.458 --> 11:35.892
he's dialed into witch business
like you wouldn't believe.

11:35.893 --> 11:38.860
If anyone can tell us
about you, it's him.

11:40.661 --> 11:47.001
While we're waiting, how
about that explanation?

11:47.002 --> 11:48.501
Fine.

11:49.636 --> 11:53.541
Yes, I asked my brothers not
to tell you I was back.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.110
I didn't want to see you
after all this time

11:55.111 --> 11:58.117
when I wasn't myself,
not like this,

11:58.118 --> 12:01.928
and perhaps, I feared that
I might be desperate to kiss you,

12:01.929 --> 12:05.223
which I clearly can't do whilst
occupying someone else's lips.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.757
Did you?

12:06.758 --> 12:08.017
Did I what?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.928
Want to kiss me.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.329
No.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.131
Are you sure about that?

12:13.132 --> 12:15.433
100 bloody percent.

12:16.572 --> 12:18.528
Satisfied?

12:18.529 --> 12:20.151
[Footsteps]

12:20.152 --> 12:22.075
Am I interrupting?

12:22.161 --> 12:25.351
No. You're right on time.

12:25.352 --> 12:28.057
Allow me to introduce
Ruben Morris,

12:28.058 --> 12:30.725
local seer, sage,
and prognosticator for hire.

12:30.726 --> 12:31.999
Thank you for coming.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.927
Yeah. Charmed.

12:33.928 --> 12:36.504
Just a reminder,
house calls cost double.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.840
Mm-hmm.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.932
Hmm.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.767
Where'd you find her?

12:42.768 --> 12:45.236
On the streets,
memory wiped clean.

12:45.237 --> 12:47.056
Could be a hex or amnesia.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.638
I figured you'd have
an idea of who she is

12:48.639 --> 12:50.391
or maybe a way to find out.

12:53.150 --> 12:57.523
I've never seen her
before, but...

12:59.990 --> 13:02.385
That doesn't mean
we can't figure it out.

13:02.386 --> 13:04.153
You get what I asked you for?

13:06.497 --> 13:09.660
Then my leaves will tell us
everything we need to know.

13:19.259 --> 13:22.110
What devil are you?

13:22.111 --> 13:25.343
Someone you once loved deeply,
my father.

13:31.146 --> 13:33.986
I've no time
for your riddles, witch.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.655
Do you not recognize me?

13:36.656 --> 13:40.161
Can you not see the daughter
you thought died so long ago?

13:40.162 --> 13:42.695
You lie!

13:42.696 --> 13:49.744
You named your sword rawthul
after the early morning sun.

13:49.745 --> 13:53.976
Its hilt was golden like
the color of my hair.

13:53.977 --> 13:56.345
You said it would
remind you of me

13:56.346 --> 14:00.146
while you were in battle,
that I'd be by your side

14:00.147 --> 14:03.553
no matter how far
afield you traveled.

14:03.554 --> 14:04.688
It can't be.

14:04.689 --> 14:06.356
The night before
you left for war,

14:06.357 --> 14:08.790
you christened that
sword with goat's blood.

14:08.791 --> 14:12.224
When I awoke, you were gone.

14:14.398 --> 14:17.736
I never saw you again.

14:17.737 --> 14:22.102
It's been a thousand years.

14:22.103 --> 14:23.945
How is this possible?

14:23.946 --> 14:27.990
I was taken
by Dahlia.

14:27.991 --> 14:29.515
I'll explain everything.

14:29.516 --> 14:31.214
Just say you believe me.

14:40.799 --> 14:43.216
My beautiful Freya.

14:47.062 --> 14:48.696
My daughter.

14:59.209 --> 15:02.577
Shh. I just got her down.

15:02.578 --> 15:04.568
Thought you might be hungry.

15:04.569 --> 15:06.781
Grilled cheese, huh?

15:06.867 --> 15:08.611
Hell of a chef.

15:08.612 --> 15:10.879
I don't like to brag.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.077
You know I can help
you with hope, right?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.814
You know,
if you want to take a break sometime,

15:14.815 --> 15:16.514
I'm good with kids.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.627
I missed 6 months of her life.

15:19.713 --> 15:20.715
I don't mind.

15:20.716 --> 15:22.920
Thanks!

15:22.921 --> 15:25.796
Hey, Jack.

15:27.087 --> 15:31.126
You've been a million
miles away lately.

15:31.127 --> 15:34.065
I'm fine. Just trying to get the
wolves back into the quarter.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.706
Ok. I know what busy is, and
I know what trying to keep busy is.

15:37.707 --> 15:40.410
I've barely seen you.

15:40.411 --> 15:42.812
I know. I just don't
want you feel obligated

15:42.813 --> 15:44.281
to me, this marriage.

15:44.282 --> 15:45.882
How many times do I
have to tell you

15:45.883 --> 15:48.117
this isn't an obligation?

15:51.657 --> 15:56.164
Ahem. Are you talking about sex?

15:56.165 --> 15:57.830
Look...

15:57.831 --> 16:00.703
The unification ritual worked,

16:00.704 --> 16:02.918
but we still have to
live as husband and wife.

16:02.919 --> 16:05.709
This isn't something that
we have to be shy about.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.109
That's the start of
our life together.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.277
We're both adults.

16:08.278 --> 16:11.177
Let's just put on
some Marvin gaye

16:11.178 --> 16:13.353
and light some candles,
and we'll just...

16:13.354 --> 16:15.956
[Hope crying]

16:15.957 --> 16:20.290
Or I could go and feed the baby.

16:28.998 --> 16:32.435
Rebekah: Can't we just get to the
part where you tell me who I am?

16:32.436 --> 16:34.169
Heh. You want
the leaves to talk,

16:34.170 --> 16:35.659
you got to sip the tea.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.673
[Pouring tea]

16:37.674 --> 16:39.997
You, too, Marcel.
This is your house.

if you're not part of it.

16:54.588 --> 16:56.021
[Sighs]

16:56.022 --> 16:58.491
The leaves say you were
both with a dark side

16:58.492 --> 17:00.351
and fought against your nature.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.809
Looks like you lost.

17:04.528 --> 17:05.528
Hmm.

17:05.529 --> 17:06.648
What?

17:06.650 --> 17:08.262
I've heard of this before.

17:08.262 --> 17:09.984
What is it?

17:09.986 --> 17:12.320
Last year, a witch
named Eva Sinclair

17:12.321 --> 17:15.439
was stealing children
to channel their power.

17:17.442 --> 17:20.743
That would be you.

17:20.744 --> 17:22.678
[Voice slowed down] You're
a murderous psychopath.

17:22.679 --> 17:23.779

She is not who you think she is.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.224

17:45.888 --> 17:47.255

17:47.256 --> 17:50.056
No one could prove
it was you, Eva.

17:50.057 --> 17:51.522
They never found those kids,

17:51.523 --> 17:52.821
and those of us with
kids of our own,

17:52.822 --> 17:54.323
we'd go to bed at night,

17:54.324 --> 17:56.659
not sleep a wink knowing
that you were out there.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.452
There was no way I was gonna
let you out into the world.

18:00.453 --> 18:02.453
Not if my son could be next.

[Music playing]

[Gia playing violin]

19:11.007 --> 19:12.976
You are as calculating
as I've heard,

19:12.977 --> 19:17.582
Mr. Mikaelson,
having your companion play

19:17.583 --> 19:23.156
the very piece I once
performed to great acclaim.

19:23.157 --> 19:26.080
Is it not also
a piece that you enjoy?

19:26.081 --> 19:30.669
It's best not to tie
more powerful than you,

19:30.670 --> 19:34.305
which is the only reason
I allowed you into my home.

19:34.306 --> 19:39.345
Now if you will excuse me,
I have many things to do.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.513
My goodness.
I had expected

19:40.514 --> 19:42.346
a more cordial welcome here.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
And why would I be
cordial to you?

19:45.770 --> 19:48.220
Since your family has
returned to this city,

19:48.221 --> 19:52.492
our elders have been murdered,
promising young witches

19:52.493 --> 19:55.131
have been inhabited
against their wills.

19:55.132 --> 19:56.333
And I can put an end
to all of it.

19:56.334 --> 20:00.605
With all due respect,
I can believe that

20:00.606 --> 20:06.881
as much as I believe I will
play my violin again someday

20:06.882 --> 20:12.418
because, Mr. Mikaelson,
beneath your formal attire

20:12.419 --> 20:18.888

to jimson weed.

we needn't be unpleasant.

to leave my home.

crown on her head.

21:16.461 --> 21:17.795
I beg your pardon.

21:17.796 --> 21:18.962
You're not the queen
of the witches.

21:18.963 --> 21:20.861
You don't speak for all of them.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.666
You know, I can't
believe I dressed up

21:22.667 --> 21:24.902

to play Beethoven.

And what do you
like, young lady?

with a jazz musician.

of my plans and, uh...

be more calculating...

You judge me, you who
cursed Kol to death?

26:10.568 --> 26:12.183
But you didn't stop
there, did you?

26:12.184 --> 26:14.987
No. As an encore,
you sought the death

26:14.988 --> 26:16.782
of an innocent child.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.115
Unh!

26:20.059 --> 26:21.058
My child!

26:23.668 --> 26:26.083
For what you would
have done to hope,

26:26.084 --> 26:28.584
I'm going to enjoy
making you suffer.

26:35.638 --> 26:37.386
You didn't answer my call.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.643
Well, I was a little bit busy.

26:40.644 --> 26:42.099
I need him alive.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.051
I have no time for your
soft-hearted sympathies.

26:46.052 --> 26:47.894
Stand aside.

26:49.527 --> 26:52.252
[Marcel groaning]

26:55.958 --> 26:57.959
About bloody time you woke.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.428
I was starting to get bored.

27:01.429 --> 27:02.629
How did you...

27:02.630 --> 27:04.331
Sertave beans
and mizule counteract

27:04.417 --> 27:05.834
the effects of the poison.

27:05.835 --> 27:07.771
Seems all my mother's prattling
about witch concoctions

27:07.772 --> 27:09.376
wasn't such a waste.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.605
[Sighs]

27:15.780 --> 27:18.016
Marcel, don't.

27:18.017 --> 27:20.387
He's just a father trying
to protect his child.

27:20.388 --> 27:23.263
He doesn't deserve
to die for it.

27:23.759 --> 27:25.160
I was only a parent
for a few months,

27:25.161 --> 27:27.601
but I felt that same instinct.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.396
The whole time you were gone...

27:33.321 --> 27:36.403
I thought you just up and
left without looking back,

27:36.404 --> 27:40.115
and then I find out you were
the one protecting hope.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.418
I had to smile.

27:41.419 --> 27:45.692
Everything that you ever wanted,
and you got it.

27:45.693 --> 27:48.500
Much as I really
wished you were here,

27:48.586 --> 27:51.826
I was truly happy for you.

27:51.827 --> 27:57.566
And as much as I wished you'd
left with me, I was happy

27:57.567 --> 27:59.870
and relieved really
to hear that you and Nik

27:59.871 --> 28:01.344
had made your peace here.

28:01.345 --> 28:03.677
Whatever my brother's faults,

28:03.678 --> 28:08.975
he's always been moved by
acts of loyalty, as have I.

28:12.068 --> 28:16.233
Marcel...
Thank you...

28:17.989 --> 28:21.327
For bothering to give a
damn about an old flame.

28:26.624 --> 28:27.671
[Grunts]

28:27.672 --> 28:29.107
Klaus: Let him die, Elijah.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.708
The witches want
that body returned unharmed.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.001
And what else do they want,
a parade,

28:33.002 --> 28:34.313
free broomsticks for all?

28:34.314 --> 28:36.630
This alliance could be
greatly beneficial to us all.

28:36.631 --> 28:39.892
Yes? Well, currying some witch's
favor does not concern me.

28:39.893 --> 28:41.159
It should.

28:43.661 --> 28:47.163
Witch allies can prove valuable.

28:47.164 --> 28:51.737
Freya... Freya, help me.

28:51.738 --> 28:53.146
Don't worry, brother.

28:53.147 --> 28:55.105
I won't let them hurt you.

28:57.007 --> 28:59.860
[Chanting]

29:02.201 --> 29:03.530
Agh!

29:09.459 --> 29:10.704
Who are you?

29:13.045 --> 29:14.666
Sleep.

29:16.257 --> 29:19.199
What did you do to him?

29:19.200 --> 29:21.842
Finn is now safe from harm,

29:21.843 --> 29:25.443
and his hatred of you can no
longer do damage to our cause.

29:25.444 --> 29:27.079
Our cause?

29:27.080 --> 29:30.313
Yes. Ours.

29:30.813 --> 29:33.782
And now if you two
can stop arguing long enough,

29:33.783 --> 29:40.025
perhaps you'll allow your older
sister to offer you a deal.

29:44.327 --> 29:48.426
What could you possibly offer us
besides fairy tales and lies?

29:48.427 --> 29:50.226
Whatever you may think
of me, brother, know this...

29:50.227 --> 29:53.361
When I speak to you,
it is the truth.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.364
If you have any doubts,
remember it was I

29:55.365 --> 29:57.533
who rescued Rebekah
from the Fauline cottage.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.534
And it was not also
you who led Finn

29:59.535 --> 30:01.631
on his vile mission
to take hope's life?

30:01.632 --> 30:06.136
The threat to hope
came from Finn, not me.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.139
The brother I knew
would never have stooped

30:08.140 --> 30:10.273
to threaten a child.

30:10.274 --> 30:12.682
Our mother destroyed him

30:14.690 --> 30:19.283
like she did me, you,
everything she touched.

30:19.284 --> 30:22.319
Do not speak as though
we are familiars.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.455
We know nothing of you.

30:25.456 --> 30:27.257
Esther: I cannot give up
my child!

30:27.258 --> 30:28.656
- Mommy!
- No, Dahlia. Freya!

30:28.657 --> 30:29.990
Mama!

30:29.991 --> 30:33.460
Do you think me a liar?

30:33.461 --> 30:36.828
That proves nothing but your
ability to conjure illusions.

30:36.829 --> 30:40.263
Before you dismiss me,
you should know this.

30:40.264 --> 30:44.367
If I have woken from my slumber,
then Dahlia has, as well.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.384
Once she's sensed
your child's magic,

30:46.385 --> 30:51.389
she will come for her, and she
has the power to kill anyone

30:51.390 --> 30:54.243
who stands in her way
unless we kill her first.

30:54.244 --> 30:56.111
It's quite convenient, isn't it?

30:56.112 --> 30:58.271
You show up in the Nick of time

30:58.272 --> 30:59.984
to help us kill
the woman with whom

30:59.985 --> 31:01.733
you spent a thousand years!

31:01.734 --> 31:03.959
You have no idea what
it took to escape her

31:03.960 --> 31:06.127
or what I lost in the trying.

31:06.128 --> 31:08.281
Her punishment will be profound.

31:08.282 --> 31:11.631
And you know how to stop her.

31:11.632 --> 31:15.236
Given the proper materials, yes.

31:15.237 --> 31:16.537
I've sent father
to procure them.

31:16.538 --> 31:20.669
You put the life of my child
in the hands of Mikael?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.611
Niklaus.

31:22.612 --> 31:24.213
This woman has knowledge
of the threat we now face

31:24.214 --> 31:26.752
and is willing to
share that information.

31:26.753 --> 31:29.590
Well, you'll excuse me, Elijah,
if I'm not inclined to trust

31:29.591 --> 31:33.159
the mysterious sister we only
just met, but by all means,

31:33.160 --> 31:36.830
if you wish to entertain
this idiocy, have at it.

31:38.701 --> 31:41.106
Thank you.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.526
Your kindness is
much appreciated.

31:44.527 --> 31:49.030
I may be willing to accept
your identity, Freya.

31:49.031 --> 31:50.657
Doesn't mean I trust you.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.954
Then I will look forward
to earning that trust.

32:02.571 --> 32:05.072
[Hope crying]

32:06.942 --> 32:11.282
Shh. It's ok.
I'm here.

32:11.283 --> 32:13.821
Oh, please stop crying.

32:13.822 --> 32:15.658
You're giving me a complex.

32:17.605 --> 32:21.629
Is it possible that I am the
worst mother on the planet?

32:21.630 --> 32:23.664
Oh, you're a great mother.

32:23.665 --> 32:26.434
Come here.

32:26.435 --> 32:29.141
Come here.

32:29.142 --> 32:32.546
[Crying]

32:32.547 --> 32:34.579
Aiden's back.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.480
We lost Jerrick.

32:36.481 --> 32:37.454
What?

32:37.455 --> 32:39.950
Mikael got him.

32:39.951 --> 32:43.452
Jack, I am so sorry.

32:43.453 --> 32:45.170
Thing is, we could
have lost a whole lot more,

32:45.171 --> 32:46.788
but Aiden played it right,

32:46.789 --> 32:48.959
kept them scattered
instead of grouped.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.425
It was a smart move.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.385
Well, he learned from you.

32:52.386 --> 32:55.599
Did he? That's not
what I told him to do.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.393
My way, it would have
all been a slaughter.

33:02.009 --> 33:04.646
She's quiet.

33:04.647 --> 33:06.247
Told you.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.361
I'm good with kids.

33:08.447 --> 33:10.880
[Music playing]

33:58.211 --> 33:59.914
Ruben was right.

33:59.915 --> 34:02.080
It's all in here,
every horrible thing

34:02.081 --> 34:03.722
Eva Sinclair has ever done.

34:03.723 --> 34:06.358
Well, you ask me, it's a good
thing you took over her body.

34:06.359 --> 34:09.260
Anyone who does this kind of
stuff to kids has it coming.

34:09.261 --> 34:10.962
Marcel, it doesn't
matter what she's done.

34:10.963 --> 34:12.797
I've still appropriated
her body without her consent.

34:12.797 --> 34:14.466
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Rebekah.

34:14.467 --> 34:17.303
I'm just saying maybe
it's a public service,

34:17.304 --> 34:19.875
but I get why it's complicated.

34:19.876 --> 34:22.514
I mean, it makes sense
why you won't kiss me.

34:23.013 --> 34:29.487
It's why I wouldn't kiss you
if I wanted to, which I don't.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.159
Mm-hmm.

34:34.129 --> 34:36.444
I don't, Marcel.

34:36.445 --> 34:38.447
Keep telling yourself that.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.577
[Giggling]

34:58.890 --> 35:01.755
You can thank Jackson
for the quiet.

35:13.938 --> 35:15.573
You will be pleased to know

35:15.574 --> 35:18.646
that Finn is no longer
a problem.

35:18.647 --> 35:23.020
However, there are other
dangers on the horizon.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.153
My father is on the loose.

35:25.154 --> 35:27.373
I need you to use
your pack to find him.

35:27.374 --> 35:28.791
No.

35:28.792 --> 35:31.829
We already lost one of ours today,
a good man.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.633
I won't let any more
wolves die, Klaus.

35:33.634 --> 35:36.133
Mikael is a threat to our child.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.842
Mikael is a threat to you.

35:37.843 --> 35:40.167
The pack will protect
hope if he comes,

35:40.168 --> 35:41.603
but I'm not gonna
let you use them

35:41.604 --> 35:43.105
just to settle your old scores.

35:43.106 --> 35:45.350
Let me be as clear as possible.

35:45.351 --> 35:48.911
Your pack, your friends,
your husband

35:48.912 --> 35:51.881
are a necessary means to
keeping our daughter safe,

35:51.882 --> 35:55.185
but I am not running
a charity hostel here.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.403
If they are not
fighting on my side,

35:57.404 --> 35:59.737
then they will not remain
alive to fight at all.

36:02.163 --> 36:05.027
You do what you need to do
to keep her safe, Klaus.

36:05.028 --> 36:08.731
I'll do the same, but if
you ever, ever use her

36:08.732 --> 36:10.298
to try to manipulate me again,

36:10.299 --> 36:13.668
it will be the last time
that you see either of us.

36:25.267 --> 36:28.571
Gia, voice-over:
I take it you got your man.

36:28.572 --> 36:30.140
Elijah, voice-over:
Vincent Griffith is alive and free

36:30.141 --> 36:32.518
of my brother Finn's influence.

36:32.519 --> 36:34.876
Once I've questioned
him to my satisfaction,

36:34.877 --> 36:37.847
I shall release him once
again to the witches.

36:40.253 --> 36:44.158
So it all worked out, and
yet I don't recall hearing,

36:44.159 --> 36:46.556
"nice job, Gia.

36:46.557 --> 36:48.257
Really appreciate the help."

36:48.258 --> 36:50.461
Yes. Forgive me.
I was a little tied up,

36:50.462 --> 36:53.833
trying to prevent Niklaus
from being...

36:53.834 --> 36:55.635
Well... Niklaus,

36:55.636 --> 36:56.669
but, yes, nice job, Gia.

36:56.670 --> 36:58.506
Really appreciate the help.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.502
You like beer?

37:00.503 --> 37:02.639
I'm adapting to my audience.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.578
Hmm.

37:05.579 --> 37:07.181
You knew she'd like me.

37:07.182 --> 37:10.113
Once upon a time,
Josephine was rather rebellious.

37:10.114 --> 37:13.316
This is a trait that you
seem to exhibit in spades.

37:13.317 --> 37:16.623
However, circumstances all but
extinguished that quality in her.

37:16.624 --> 37:18.324
Had she know
that you were coming,

37:18.325 --> 37:21.327
she never would have
welcomed us into her home,

37:21.328 --> 37:23.095
nor would she have
been swayed by your...

37:23.096 --> 37:24.295
What was it she called it?

37:24.296 --> 37:25.297
Candor.

37:25.298 --> 37:27.603
Candor.

37:27.604 --> 37:30.471
Is everything always 10 steps
ahead of the game with you?

37:30.472 --> 37:33.974
Well, often, victory is
allowing your opponent

37:33.975 --> 37:37.211
to believe that they are
triumphant till they're not.

37:37.212 --> 37:39.714
Ok. Just remember
who sealed the deal.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.481
Credit where credit's due.

37:46.186 --> 37:50.389
I told you you needed a woman
to mess things up for you.

37:56.495 --> 37:59.331
[Music playing]

38:05.772 --> 38:11.115
You never told me if you
like me in this dress.

38:11.116 --> 38:13.998
You're right.
I didn't.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.021
Zipper's stuck.

38:15.022 --> 38:16.857
Help me out of it.

38:27.766 --> 38:31.472
[Breathes deeply]

38:52.217 --> 38:56.290
Klaus, voice-over: In every
moment, a choice exists.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.539
We can cling to the past

38:58.540 --> 39:01.794
or embrace
the inevitability of change...

39:04.766 --> 39:08.505
And allow a brighter future
to unfold before us.

39:12.346 --> 39:14.644
Such an uncertain future
may call

39:14.645 --> 39:17.947
for even more uncertain allies.

39:19.485 --> 39:27.289
Either way, a new day is coming,
whether we like it or not.

39:27.290 --> 39:31.701
The question is
will you control it,

39:31.702 --> 39:35.666
or will it control you?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.102
You know, for centuries,

39:37.103 --> 39:40.775
werewolf alphas
have lived as kings

39:40.776 --> 39:43.504
of a frightened
and cursed people

39:43.505 --> 39:46.016
forced to change every
month on a full moon,

39:46.017 --> 39:49.469
but now your pack is cured.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.654
You can change at will.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.453
You are at peace,

39:53.454 --> 39:57.724
and yet Jackson takes his
leadership for granted.

39:57.725 --> 40:01.330
He doesn't see that we
live in a new world,

40:01.331 --> 40:04.734
which is precisely why the
wolves need a new leader,

40:04.735 --> 40:07.208
someone chosen by the wolves

40:07.209 --> 40:15.369
to guide them into a new
future, someone like you.

40:15.370 --> 40:23.258
I can help you become the
leader your pack deserves.

40:23.259 --> 40:25.592
Yeah?

40:25.593 --> 40:27.895
And what's in it for you?

40:27.896 --> 40:31.528
In return, I would only ask
that you and your pack swear

40:31.529 --> 40:33.097
to protect my daughter.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.233
That is all I will
ever ask of you

40:35.234 --> 40:37.936
because that is all
that matters to me.

40:40.023 --> 40:42.435
You can let me know
when you're ready,

40:42.436 --> 40:48.237
but do bear in mind that time
is forever ticking forward,

40:48.238 --> 40:50.939
which means that tomorrow...

40:50.940 --> 40:53.641
[Tap tap]

40:53.642 --> 40:56.142
Is already here.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.544
You kids should know better.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.005
It's not safe
being out this late.

41:11.006 --> 41:15.558
You never know
who you'll run into...

41:15.559 --> 41:18.057
Ghosts,

41:18.058 --> 41:20.463
goblins...

41:23.264 --> 41:25.483
Eva Sinclair.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.816
Aah!

41:31.158 --> 41:34.136
Sam! No! No!

41:34.137 --> 41:36.103
Don't be scared.

41:36.104 --> 41:38.071
I'm not gonna kill you...

41:39.508 --> 41:48.078
Not until I have taken every
little bit of your power.
