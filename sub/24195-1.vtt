00:05.000 --> 00:08.083
Previously on "Billions"...

00:08.166 --> 00:10.083
The only enemy
more dangerous

00:10.166 --> 00:13.083
than a man with
unlimited resources...

00:13.166 --> 00:13.959
is one
with nothing to lose.

00:14.041 --> 00:17.375
And that is what
you are looking at

00:17.458 --> 00:19.166
right here.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.000
This is for you...

00:21.083 --> 00:24.875
Look at them.
With that morning-after glow.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.000
This is what your wife
is out doing.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.000
You see things differently.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.625
That's an edge.
Congratulations.

00:31.709 --> 00:33.583
All the analysts
now answer to you.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.583
We've long suspected criminal
activity at Axe Capital.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.083
-Some parts of the job

00:39.166 --> 00:40.625
are pretty intuitive.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.458
Is there any law enforcement
here?

00:42.542 --> 00:43.667
No.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.542
You let me know
if any show up.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.542
-You should name a C.I.O.
-I'll do it.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.291
But I'm not running with you.
And neither are the kids.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.125
So, you do what you got to do,
but we're staying.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.333
Black Jack Foley.

00:56.417 --> 00:58.000
I'll be better

00:58.083 --> 01:01.041
if you help me out
with a little something.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.041
Jack.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.750
Will you make me governor?

01:06.291 --> 01:09.542
The Ice Juice IPO never tracks
back to my family,

01:09.625 --> 01:10.959
to my father's investment.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.458
Get out of the stock, Chuck.
They're gonna crush you.

01:13.542 --> 01:16.083
Wow, I'm glad to see
you view me as so defenseless.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.917
The Ice Juice short,
how do I get a piece of that?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.834
Ice Juice
never made anyone sick.

01:20.917 --> 01:21.792
You baited him?

01:21.875 --> 01:25.750
You used my company,
my career, my future...

01:25.834 --> 01:28.417
Where do you get
the fucking nerve?!

01:28.500 --> 01:29.834
I am done with you.

01:29.917 --> 01:30.750
You've been named
interim U.S. Attorney

01:30.834 --> 01:33.000
for the Eastern District.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.333
You didn't think this shit
happened by accident,

01:35.417 --> 01:36.667
did you, Mr. Dake?

01:36.750 --> 01:39.583
I've arranged that you'll lead
the prosecution at Eastern.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.917
Tell Sacker I'm gonna make
her Chief of Crim.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.709
I'm gonna find it.

01:44.792 --> 01:46.542
Whatever thread
you left behind.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.917
And I am gonna pull on it

01:48.000 --> 01:50.834
until your whole fucking world
unravels.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.792
I might go down behind
all of this,

01:52.875 --> 01:55.291
but you are gonna be
right there next to me.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.291
Worth it.

My family bred 'em,
American quarterhorses.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.625
Those babies
fetch quite the price,

03:05.709 --> 03:08.208
so we were real gentle
with the product.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.417
We used teasers.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.458
Those are stallions
you put into the stall

03:11.542 --> 03:14.625
with the sole purpose of
making sure the mare's in heat,

03:14.709 --> 03:15.709
primed for breeding.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.208
Now, a teaser, he doesn't get
to do any fucking.

03:17.291 --> 03:20.000
He's just there
to get the mare ready.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.250
Take her kicks.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.083

By God, that teaser,

03:25.834 --> 03:29.250
he's got a rager going on
the whole dang time.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.959
But that doesn't matter.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.959
As soon as that dam
is ready,

03:33.041 --> 03:35.750
we yank that teaser out of
there, lead the real stud in,

03:35.834 --> 03:38.166
and he gets to do
all the fucking.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.291
Teaser has to make do with some
mangy hay and a bucket of oats.

03:42.375 --> 03:42.875
Brutal.

03:42.959 --> 03:47.583
Yeah, nature often is.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.291
Right now, you're
that teaser, aren't you,

03:50.375 --> 03:51.959
with Dake
prosecuting Axelrod?

03:52.041 --> 03:53.291
He's getting all the credit

03:53.375 --> 03:57.083
for putting the cuffs on him
and freezing his assets.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.166
Dake is fucking Axelrod
right now in front of everybody,

04:00.250 --> 04:02.250
and you,
you're back in the barn,

04:02.333 --> 04:05.583
nursing your rager
with a bucket of oats.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.166
Well, as long
as justice is served,

04:08.250 --> 04:10.500
credit doesn't matter
at all, General.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.917
Good.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.333
Why don't you tell me
how it really makes you feel

04:16.417 --> 04:19.458
to see Dake with the lariat
in his grip?

04:22.875 --> 04:25.709
You'd like to tear that case
from him with your bare hands

04:25.792 --> 04:27.500
and leave him crying
in the gutter.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.542
Hmm?

04:30.625 --> 04:32.291
You got some wolf in you,

04:32.375 --> 04:35.166
which is why
you're not getting fired.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.500
Not quite yet, anyway.

04:36.583 --> 04:39.000
No, sir, you are among
the blessed few.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.333
It's end times
for most of your brethren,

04:41.417 --> 04:44.083
but you have not been
raptured yet.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.834
I've only kept on
seven U.S. attorneys

04:45.917 --> 04:48.166
since the president
was good enough to appoint me

04:48.250 --> 04:49.458
Attorney General
of these United States.

04:49.542 --> 04:53.375
I just wanted to make sure
our agendas are aligned

04:53.458 --> 04:55.625
when it comes to
that justice you spoke of

04:55.709 --> 04:57.083
moments ago.

04:57.166 --> 05:00.458
These high-profile cases you
and your people have working?

05:00.542 --> 05:02.375
Heap of Wall Street-related
matters.

05:02.458 --> 05:05.333
Well, the markets
are within my purview.

05:05.417 --> 05:06.083
Well, that may be,

05:06.166 --> 05:08.000
but I come
from baseball country.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.583
We learn at an early age

05:10.667 --> 05:11.875
that a tie
goes to the runner.

05:11.959 --> 05:15.500
And that is how I want you to
think of our business community

05:15.583 --> 05:16.917
and its leaders
from now on.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.625
Now, look,
if there's a clear crime,

05:18.709 --> 05:20.500
then, by all means,
you go after it.

05:20.583 --> 05:24.458
But if it's a bang-bang play,
don't call a man out on a win.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.500
Just let that rally continue.

05:26.583 --> 05:30.417
I thought you come
from horse country.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.709
West Texas
contains multitudes, Chuck.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.792
Ahh.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.792
Prioritize the cases
that make sense.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.333
You know what to do
with the rest.

05:42.417 --> 05:45.834
They're marked
so there's no confusion.

dinner night after tomorrow.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.333
-Platinum invite list--
-Fuck. Fuck that.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.250
Fuck having this meeting
without Axe here.

07:23.333 --> 07:24.375
Fuck all of this.

07:24.458 --> 07:27.125
-Easy, "Dollar" Bill.
-Nothing about this is easy.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.875
I've been humping my ass
into the city,

07:28.959 --> 07:31.417
hour and a half in traffic, into
this swanky Manhattan office,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.166
and you haven't called
a single meeting

07:33.250 --> 07:35.333
because the government's
frozen all the assets.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.041
So when you called
this meeting,

07:37.125 --> 07:38.667
I assumed that meant
it was go-time

07:38.750 --> 07:40.458
and they've finally been
unfrozen.

07:40.542 --> 07:43.041
Not yet. Still frozen like
Otzi in the goddamn Alps.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.500
That's the Frozen Man, right?

07:48.792 --> 07:50.291
I need those funds to flow

07:50.375 --> 07:52.834
like the Kancamangus Rapids.

07:52.917 --> 07:55.166
I'm ready to rock and roll
on full auto

07:55.250 --> 07:56.709
right the fuck now.

08:29.417 --> 08:33.959
I wasn't gonna stay
in Westport.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.834
Guys like you
head to the city

08:35.917 --> 08:37.709
when their marriages
fall apart

08:37.792 --> 08:39.583
for the same reason
birds fly south

08:39.667 --> 08:42.333
instead of freezing
their asses off.

08:42.417 --> 08:43.458
It's in the genetic code.

08:43.542 --> 08:47.875
You're the first person
to see the place.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.667
Other than the kids.

08:49.750 --> 08:50.583
What do they think?

08:50.667 --> 08:54.125
It's stocked with video games
and snacks.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.667
They seem fine.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.542
How about you?

08:58.625 --> 09:01.625
Did you just change
out of the pajamas

09:01.709 --> 09:02.750
three minutes ago?

09:04.166 --> 09:06.625
Are you planning to come
to the office anytime soon?

09:06.709 --> 09:08.375
Yeah, once my assets
are unfrozen.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.542
Should everyone else
go home, too?

09:09.625 --> 09:12.625
Not if they want to stay
on the payroll.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.667
That's inspiring stuff.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.583
Must be what Kennedy said
to his staff

09:17.667 --> 09:18.583
during the Cuban
missile crisis.

09:18.667 --> 09:23.083
Kennedy wasn't under
as much pressure as I am.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.542
I tell you, Bobby,
it's times like these I...

09:26.625 --> 09:30.000
I wish you hadn't fired
Dr. Gus.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.834
Why?

09:31.917 --> 09:34.667
Because this...

09:34.750 --> 09:36.917
is a fuckin' disaster.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.000
I get it!
I get it.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.750
You're worried that every day
you're on the sidelines

09:42.834 --> 09:46.500
makes it harder for you to make
your numbers for the year.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.667
Not harder.
Impossible.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.667
-Well, know this.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.458
You won't fall
below the hard deck.

09:52.542 --> 09:55.375
No one is crashing and burning.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.208
If you come through for me now,
you will all make a bonus

09:58.291 --> 10:00.583
of at least what you made
last year.

10:05.083 --> 10:08.041
But first, you need to deliver
on today's mission.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.333
The idea dinner.

10:10.417 --> 10:14.000
Top-ten hedge-fund managers
in the city will be there.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.208
These rat fucks

10:15.291 --> 10:16.542
are how these billionaires
measure themselves.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.333
Even being in the room
confers upon you

10:19.417 --> 10:21.125
almost mythical status,

10:21.208 --> 10:23.083
like you're a knight
of the Round Table.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.917
-Maybachs.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.875
I've heard Axe say he'd never go
to one of these hog shows.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.750
Yeah, that he couldn't
understand why anybody

10:29.834 --> 10:31.792
would want to sit with his
rivals and give away good plays.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.375
The whys
and goddamned wherefores

10:33.458 --> 10:36.208
are not for you to concern
your pretty little heads with.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.792
I think it's great
that we're invited, considering.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.667
We're kind of the most toxic
shop on the street right now.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.875
They begged him to come,
sent emissaries, gifts,

10:43.959 --> 10:47.250
all to ensure he'd be there
to share his insights.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.250
I'm so radioactive right now,

10:48.333 --> 10:50.667
I had to beg an invite
to this idea dinner.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.000
I need to understand
why you'd do that.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.500
Why do you think it matters?

10:54.583 --> 10:56.000
Look at where I am.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.583
Indicted,
thanks to your husband.

10:58.667 --> 11:02.125
Thanks to you giving in
to the worst of your instincts.

11:02.208 --> 11:03.792
Well, yeah, maybe that, too.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.792
But the point is
I'm about to stand trial.

11:05.875 --> 11:09.458
If I win,
I want a company to return to.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.709
The government,
by freezing my funds,

11:11.792 --> 11:14.417
is trying to tell the story
that we're crooked.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.583
They know we're not.

11:15.667 --> 11:19.250
They know they spent years
trying and failing to prove it,

11:19.333 --> 11:20.333
but the story
is being written

11:20.417 --> 11:21.583
every day now.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.125
So events
like this idea dinner,

11:24.208 --> 11:25.417
they also tell a story.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.625
So if I'm there,
I'm telling the story

11:26.709 --> 11:29.750
that I'm not cowering,
I'm not hiding,

11:29.834 --> 11:30.917
I'm not defeated.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.333
But I can't just show up.
I have to dominate it.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.083
The only thing is,

11:35.166 --> 11:38.291
for the first time
in my life,

11:38.375 --> 11:42.625
I don't think I can.

11:42.709 --> 11:44.583
Fear?

11:44.667 --> 11:45.834
Rage.

11:45.917 --> 11:49.667
We need to arm him with an idea
that will shock and awe

11:49.750 --> 11:52.458
so the dinner ends
with Axe's idea

11:52.542 --> 11:54.500
e-mailed and texted
from firm to firm,

11:54.583 --> 11:56.792
leaving no doubt
we are still the sharpest.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.583
So go generate some speedballs
he can dazzle with

11:58.667 --> 12:02.667
or go the fuck home
for good.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.583
You're not authorized
to guarantee bonuses.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.917
Your ego just wrote a check
your body can't cash.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.458
I appreciate you waiting
until after the meeting

12:16.542 --> 12:18.625
to hit me with that one.

12:18.709 --> 12:19.750
I know holding back
doesn't come naturally.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.709
Well, I was so shocked
you could quote "Top Gun,"

12:22.792 --> 12:23.959
it took me a second
to respond.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.750
I figure speaking their language
is part of the job now.

12:26.834 --> 12:27.625
But none of this
is going to matter

12:27.709 --> 12:30.291
unless Axe gets us
back in the game.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.458
I have our best man
working on it right now.

12:33.542 --> 12:34.625
I want to run
a Dickens process.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.667
Tony Robbins took me through it
a few years back, so...

12:37.750 --> 12:38.333
Sit down.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.375
I take you to specific
moments in your life,

12:46.458 --> 12:47.834
use them to jump
into the future.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.500
You get to experience
different possible versions

12:49.583 --> 12:51.625
of your life, like in--

12:51.709 --> 12:55.166
Like "A Christmas Carol,"
hence, Dickens.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.166
Let's find a moment
early on

12:57.250 --> 12:59.417
when your rage served you.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.583
Close your eyes.

13:03.542 --> 13:07.125
Let it come to you.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.375
Fifth grade.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.875
I needed money.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.750
There were these rich
eighth-grade pricks

13:17.834 --> 13:18.834
from Harrison.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.667
God, I hated
their stupid faces.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.625
I had an Islander jersey
and a Koho hockey stick.

13:23.709 --> 13:26.250
I signed 'em Mike Bossy
and Bryan Trottier,

13:26.333 --> 13:28.166
and the dickbags bought 'em.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.291
What'd you get?

13:29.375 --> 13:32.750
$300 cash,
new sneakers, Atari.

13:32.834 --> 13:34.750
When they found out,
they went to town on me

13:34.834 --> 13:35.583
like
Dave "The Hammer" Schultz.

13:35.667 --> 13:40.208
God, I got so angry at them,

13:40.291 --> 13:42.542
my parents
for not having enough money,

13:42.625 --> 13:45.417
myself for getting caught.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.583
That rage...

13:48.667 --> 13:51.041
grew in me.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.375
It worked like jet fuel
for years.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.417
It was useful.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.250
Yeah. Fuck, yeah, it was.
Got me here.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.041
Your brain, instincts,
market feel, all that,

14:01.125 --> 14:02.166
had more to do with it.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.709
But for the moment,
let's agree

14:03.792 --> 14:05.417
that the rage worked
for a time.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.166
But let's look for a moment
when it was the wrong tool

14:08.250 --> 14:10.250
and it cost you
more than it made you.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.250
We're gonna talk
about your husband now?

14:12.333 --> 14:13.917
No, about you

14:14.000 --> 14:16.709
and how when you allow
your anger

14:16.792 --> 14:19.250
to make you blind
to consequences,

14:19.333 --> 14:22.542
it shuts off those other
more crucial skills.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.375
Let's take a moment

14:27.458 --> 14:29.208
from your personal life

14:29.291 --> 14:32.792
with Lara.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.875
She'd say I allowed my anger
to throw everything away,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.333
to crack the foundation
of trust.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.333
So what if you could go
back into your past?

14:41.417 --> 14:44.125
How would you handle
that memorabilia sale?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.125
My past?

14:46.208 --> 14:47.083
Nah, I wouldn't change it.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.667
Good. We can't.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.709
But holding on
to the feeling

14:53.792 --> 14:55.792
of that rage,
look to the future.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.667
Where do you see yourself
in five years

14:57.750 --> 15:00.125
if you carry on this way,

15:00.208 --> 15:04.417
if you continue to carry
the weight of this anger?

15:04.500 --> 15:07.542
Where are you in 10?

15:07.625 --> 15:09.834
20?

15:09.917 --> 15:11.959
Are you happy?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.792
Are you fulfilled?

15:14.875 --> 15:18.875
Or are you lonely, bitter?

15:18.959 --> 15:22.041
Lashing out.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.917
Fuck Dickens!

15:24.959 --> 15:27.542
All I see is jail

15:27.625 --> 15:30.041
and the company I spent
my lifetime building up

15:30.125 --> 15:31.000
reduced to rubble.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.709
Look, I want to do this
with you.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.333
I want to believe
that it can help.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.834
But I just don't think
I can.

15:38.917 --> 15:42.333
Okay.

15:42.417 --> 15:46.166
But now you know exactly
where your focus needs to be,

15:46.250 --> 15:47.667
where you need to be.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.458
At the office.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.041
And when you get back home
from this conclave,

15:52.125 --> 15:53.959
make sure you get
with your people.

15:54.041 --> 15:57.625
Make sure we are all
on the same bill of lading.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.208
There's a new sheriff in town.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.959
You are all my deputies.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.834
Gonna be one hell
of a turkey shoot!

16:03.917 --> 16:05.917
Thank you!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.166
God bless you.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.834
Are we still employed?

16:12.917 --> 16:14.333
We seem to be.

16:14.417 --> 16:17.333
Mm. And the shift in agenda
he was talking about,

16:17.417 --> 16:18.208
that hits us?

16:18.291 --> 16:20.500
Mm-hmm, but we press on,
as always.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.917
I'll handle the optics,
and we'll manage up the chain.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.208
Just so you know,
I'm as nimble as I need to be.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.417
I count on that.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.375
This is the fissile material.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.917
You'll know what to do.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.875
Well, well, well.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.834
Bryan Connerty
and his new lord.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.834
May your reign be long
and fruitful.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.583
I serve at the pleasure--

16:40.667 --> 16:42.417
Don't we all?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.083
Freezing the assets?

16:44.166 --> 16:47.083
Now, that's an Ivan Koloff bear
hug you're putting on the man.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.250
You're squeezing the breath
out of him.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.750
I was more Iron Sheik era.

16:50.834 --> 16:51.750
All right, fine.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.375
It's a camel clutch,
and a hell of a good one.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.125
You seem pretty comfy
at his elbow.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.041
That's the job.

16:58.125 --> 16:58.834
Until it ain't.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.667
Man, ain't that the truth?

17:01.750 --> 17:04.417
But you can't let this monster
have a chance to recover.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.333
Yes. I'll use my leverage
and strength

17:06.417 --> 17:08.250
and get something valuable
in return.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.792
I know my job, Chuck.

17:09.875 --> 17:13.041
And I also know the real reason
you need this to go quickly.

17:13.125 --> 17:16.083
Oh? And what do you imagine
that is?

17:16.166 --> 17:17.834
You are like a man who committed
a crime of passion.

17:17.917 --> 17:21.917
In the moment,
it felt so right.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.375
But in the morning,

17:23.458 --> 17:25.709
all he sees is the blood
splashed on the walls

17:25.792 --> 17:28.000
of his dead lover's bedroom,

17:28.083 --> 17:30.291
and he just wants it
all to go away,

17:30.375 --> 17:31.917
but it can't.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.125
I'm going to prosecute the case
to the full extent of the law

17:34.208 --> 17:37.417
without breaking the terms
of our agreement.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.417
So if you don't clean up
all the blood

17:39.500 --> 17:40.959
before the cops get there,

17:41.041 --> 17:43.667
I cannot guarantee your DNA
stays out of the courtroom.

17:43.750 --> 17:47.333
This is a conversation we need
to finish somewhere else...

17:47.417 --> 17:48.500
private.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.917
Hey.

18:07.000 --> 18:07.375
Hey.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.458
You ready?

18:10.542 --> 18:11.750
Yeah.

18:11.834 --> 18:12.375
Let's do this.

18:14.208 --> 18:17.166
And newly appointed
U.S. Treasury Secretary

18:17.250 --> 18:19.917
Todd Krakow was sworn in today.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.291
Look at that preening fuck.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.834
You know, his name on money may
actually make me like him less.

18:25.917 --> 18:28.208
Hello, Bobby.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.834
Birch!

18:30.917 --> 18:31.500
-Axe.
-Wendy.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.667
Lara.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.291
I'm here
to go over my assets.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.625
You were supposed to bring
a business manager

18:40.709 --> 18:41.750
or accountant,
not a competitor.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.500
I only compete with currently
active hedge funds.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.291
Ding, ding, ding!
I want a clean fight.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.458
Protect yourselves at all times.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.166
There'll be no
standing eight count.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.208
Give Lara full access
to the books.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.208
She has a right to see
the state of things.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.834
As you wish, my liege.

19:01.291 --> 19:04.542
Run her through
where the bodies are buried.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.333
This column,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.250
this one,
this one, and this one

19:12.333 --> 19:14.208
are the main holdings.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.041
There you have it.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.542
I see the balance
on the accounts.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.417
And what a soaring,
fat balance it is.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.041
We need to see
the trade history

19:22.125 --> 19:24.333
leading up to the redemptions
and cash positions.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.375
Sure. Let me bring up
a different screen.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.375
Like Squanto should have said
to the pilgrims,

19:27.458 --> 19:30.291
"Get the fuck out of here."
-Wags, come on.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.458
It's proprietary.
You're not seeing it.

19:31.542 --> 19:35.125
-This is bullshit, Wags.
-Lara, we're not having a fight.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.917
I'm telling you, you're not
gonna see that shit.

19:37.000 --> 19:37.875
As is often the case,

19:37.959 --> 19:39.333
the longer you can hold off,
the more likely

19:39.417 --> 19:42.250
you'll be screaming in pleasure
at the end.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.917
We're not making a porno,
Orrin,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.375
though I appreciate the effort
to make me laugh.

19:45.458 --> 19:49.375
My father always said laughter
was the best medicine,

19:49.458 --> 19:51.166
which is why I was so confused

19:51.250 --> 19:53.875
when I finally tried cocaine
in the '80s.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.750
Okay.
You lightened my mood.

19:57.834 --> 20:00.166
Now make me really happy
and tell me how we expose

20:00.250 --> 20:01.750
all the shit
that Rhoades pulled

20:01.834 --> 20:02.834
to suck me in.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.250
Easier said, Bobby,
because we can't introduce that

20:05.333 --> 20:08.250
without confirming
your actions as a response.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.250
We'd be virtually admitting
your role.

20:10.333 --> 20:14.041
What he did,
it's a fucking crime.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.000
Maybe.
But it's not a defense.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.458
All right, get to the rest.

20:18.542 --> 20:23.083
Let's get our new head
of compliance up here.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.792
♪ Hey, Mr. Jim  ♪

20:25.875 --> 20:29.291
♪ I can see
the shape you're in  ♪

20:29.375 --> 20:33.208

such a lady killer  ♪

20:33.291 --> 20:36.500

20:47.291 --> 20:48.834
The answer man is here.

20:48.917 --> 20:52.333
The charges carry
a long potential sentence.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.375
15 to 20 years

20:53.458 --> 20:57.000
and tens of millions
in fines, of course.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.542
They're using the locked-up
money to distract us

20:59.625 --> 21:02.208
as they meticulously build
their case.

21:02.291 --> 21:04.792
They are using the locked money
to do three things.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.166
One, to make me take a plea.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.583
Two, to make it hard
for my people so they'll quit.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.125
And, three, to spread the word
through implication

21:11.208 --> 21:13.041
that this is about more than
my actions against Ice Juice,

21:13.125 --> 21:15.667
that we are
an illegal enterprise.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.792
Turn on the telestrator,

21:16.875 --> 21:19.875
because you just diagramed
the shit out of this.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.333
How long can they really
keep it frozen?

21:24.417 --> 21:25.375
Wrong question.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.208
This is where
the holding out comes in.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.458
Don't let anyone know
you care.

21:29.542 --> 21:32.834
Mm, we'll find a way
to get you liquid again

21:32.917 --> 21:34.333
in four to six months.

21:34.417 --> 21:36.041
Months? Fuck that.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.166
There is one idea that might
get it done right away,

21:38.250 --> 21:41.375
but it's one
you're going to hate.

21:41.458 --> 21:45.375
Give up your so-called
license to trade.

21:45.458 --> 21:48.667
Walk away from the table.
Cash in your chips.

21:48.750 --> 21:52.083
They'd be forced to release
the bulk of your money.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.417
That is the only angle
that I see.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.959
And if it's the only angle
that I see,

21:57.041 --> 21:58.667
it's the only angle there is.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.208
You agree to stop trading,
you personally,

22:00.291 --> 22:03.166
and they give you back
your money.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.625
We would set something up
where Axe Cap trades it

22:05.709 --> 22:06.542
without your direction.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.250
It would function
like a blind trust,

22:09.333 --> 22:11.083
but the language
would be such

22:11.166 --> 22:13.709
and they'd be releasing
so much money back to you

22:13.792 --> 22:15.000
that if you violated it --

22:15.083 --> 22:17.291
Oh, that is a bozo no-no.

22:17.375 --> 22:20.750
Do that and you would earn
yourself a lifetime ban...

22:20.834 --> 22:22.417
and more.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.542
No.

22:26.625 --> 22:27.083
No fuckin' way.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.500
I'll never do that.

22:28.583 --> 22:31.583
If I give up my ability
to trade, I'm agreeing

22:31.667 --> 22:33.583
that they're right and I built
all this by cheating.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.917
I might as well give up
my license to breathe.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.917
You guys have to work it out
yourselves.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.542
Do not put me
in the middle of it.

22:42.625 --> 22:43.458
What the fuck is--

22:46.291 --> 22:47.166
What's the problem?

22:47.250 --> 22:49.583
Your lap dog
is not cooperating.

22:49.667 --> 22:50.792
Wags, although Lara
should have faith,

22:50.875 --> 22:54.208
because I've shown I'm pretty
good at making a dollar,

22:54.291 --> 22:55.875
she has a right to choose
and make her own decisions,

22:55.959 --> 22:57.834
like I told you.

22:57.917 --> 22:59.417
I thought you were telling me
with a wink.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.959
That's why I played back
with the "liege" stuff.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.667
-Not an actual wink, but--

23:02.750 --> 23:05.208
Are you planning on giving him
your money to manage?

23:05.291 --> 23:07.792
If it ever gets unfrozen,
I might.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.208
-For general health, financial,

23:10.291 --> 23:11.500
and for things between us.

23:11.583 --> 23:13.500
Now that I'm able
to take outside money,

23:13.583 --> 23:14.834
I thought I'd start
with friends and family.

23:14.917 --> 23:16.750
We're neither.

23:16.834 --> 23:19.041
Listen, Lara,
I won't micromanage you.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.667
But if you really plan

23:21.750 --> 23:24.250
on giving billions of dollars
to this stock jockey,

23:24.333 --> 23:25.375
ask him this,

23:25.458 --> 23:28.834
how he's codified the behavioral
heuristics at his firm

23:28.917 --> 23:31.458
from stock selection
to position sizing

23:31.542 --> 23:33.959
to market timing
to risk management.

23:34.041 --> 23:34.750
He hasn't,

23:34.834 --> 23:38.041
because his
decision-flow process

23:38.125 --> 23:40.083
is Google, Exxon,
Proctor & Gamble,

23:40.166 --> 23:42.166
same as any old lady
in Kansas City,

23:42.250 --> 23:44.583
except she won't charge you
two and twenty for it.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.667
We are all in
the same game, Axe,

23:45.750 --> 23:48.750
protecting assets
and trying to find that edge.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.875
You have about as much edge
as Mister Rogers.

23:50.959 --> 23:51.917
Okay, guys!

23:53.333 --> 23:55.875
Okay, you go on ahead,
sweetheart.

23:55.959 --> 23:58.500
You look into everything
you want with Birch,

23:58.583 --> 24:01.333
and I will support
whatever you decide.

24:02.959 --> 24:03.834
Thank you, Bobby.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.667
You really want me
to let 'em into the books

24:06.750 --> 24:07.667
and see the trades?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.750
Lots of guys watch
Bruce Lee movies.

24:09.834 --> 24:11.625
Doesn't mean
you can do karate.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.667
Boot up the screen.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.375
I still can't believe
he made that move.

24:22.458 --> 24:23.750
It was the smart thing
to do.

24:23.834 --> 24:27.458
If I'd known what you were
doing, I would have never--

24:27.542 --> 24:28.667
Yes. No.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.792
I mean, if you'd known,
if you'd told me,

24:30.875 --> 24:32.000
if I'd known--

24:32.083 --> 24:34.667
It was a moment of peak.
I'm gonna stop and tell you?

24:34.750 --> 24:35.625
Wish you had.

24:35.709 --> 24:37.250
You were very convincing.

24:37.333 --> 24:40.041
But, in a way, it all had to
play itself out, didn't it?

24:40.125 --> 24:41.875
If I had known
what you were gonna do--

24:41.959 --> 24:44.208
-You'd have tried to stop me.
-Yes, I would have,

24:44.291 --> 24:45.583
and I might have succeeded.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.375
Well, that would have been
better in one way...

24:48.458 --> 24:50.458
but worse
in all the others...

24:50.542 --> 24:55.208
because now we are home,
and we are a "we" again.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.875
And if I hadn't have done
a thing,

24:56.959 --> 24:57.709
who knows
how I'd have felt,

24:57.792 --> 24:59.166
what resentments
might have festered?

24:59.250 --> 25:00.208
But you did and I did,

25:00.291 --> 25:02.917
and there is nothing
festering.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.458
Except for the thing
I'm off to deal with now.

25:07.542 --> 25:08.041
Yeah.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.625
Except that.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.500
Thank you.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.917
Your wife,
she still down in D.C.?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.417
Yes, outside.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.667
You must miss her.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.792
We talk every day,
and the train ride is only--

25:26.875 --> 25:28.917
Sure it is.
But the problem is

25:29.000 --> 25:31.041
that the free flow
of information,

25:31.125 --> 25:35.083
the casual details of the day,
can get lost.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.375
You know,
for a time, even though

25:36.458 --> 25:39.750
we did reside in the same house,
my wife and I lived that way.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.583
You're telling me that you
and your wife have no secrets?

25:42.667 --> 25:44.333
Oh  I'm certain
some are still lurking.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.750
We all mask certain emotions,

25:47.834 --> 25:50.125
often our most intense ones,

25:50.208 --> 25:51.250
like Bjorn Borg did.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.709
But like Borg,

25:52.792 --> 25:56.834
eventually, it'll end up
costing you everything,

25:56.917 --> 25:58.625
so we're digging in, right?

25:58.709 --> 25:59.750
Digging in.
-Ah.

25:59.834 --> 26:02.792
She told you
about her short on Ice Juice.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.458
That's the kind of bond
we have.

26:04.542 --> 26:05.792
So you are here to tell me

26:05.875 --> 26:07.792
she will turn
state's evidence

26:07.875 --> 26:09.667
to avoid being the subject
of prosecution?

26:09.750 --> 26:12.875
She is a co-conspirator
in Axe's scheme.

26:12.959 --> 26:14.083
No, sir.

26:14.166 --> 26:17.583
She's safe due to the terms
of the deal you and I struck.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.166
That was about your father.

26:20.250 --> 26:23.041
I said me and my family.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.709
And you assented.

26:24.792 --> 26:28.583
And now you will say
this is unduly burdensome,

26:28.667 --> 26:31.375
which will force me to say
that it is less so

26:31.458 --> 26:33.250
than remaining a glorified
Internal Affairs grunt

26:33.333 --> 26:36.166
working out a dank office

26:36.250 --> 26:39.000
on the fringes
of our capital city.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.000
And, as you saw,

26:40.083 --> 26:41.667
Jock Jeffcoat is taking
my counsel these days

26:41.750 --> 26:45.041
on who should be in
and who should be out.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.250
There's only
so much compromise

26:47.333 --> 26:49.166
of my own system of morality

26:49.250 --> 26:51.291
that I can swallow.

26:51.375 --> 26:55.500
I happen to know
you're a Calvinist.

26:55.583 --> 27:00.291
You believe we're all fallen
beyond any hope for redemption.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.500
So answer me this.

27:02.583 --> 27:06.417
What's one more demerit
for a friend allied with you

27:06.500 --> 27:08.250
against a common foe?

27:08.333 --> 27:09.542
Ecumenically,
that's not exactly right,

27:09.625 --> 27:12.083
and it's borderline
offensive.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.083
But, also, it's...

27:14.166 --> 27:17.375
pretty much true.

27:17.458 --> 27:20.959
Okay. I'll do all I can

27:21.041 --> 27:23.500
to keep your wife
out of it,

27:23.583 --> 27:25.125
but now you owe me.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.375
Name it.

27:26.458 --> 27:28.375
I'll hold it in reserve.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.542
A favor to be named later.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.208
Look at you, huh?

27:35.291 --> 27:37.959
Muckin' in.

27:38.041 --> 27:39.458
Done.

27:39.542 --> 27:41.542
This is all on background,
no attribution.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.750
Yep, until
you want to go on record.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.291
Good. You know, if they
were gonna charge the firm,

27:45.375 --> 27:47.500
they would have.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.875
Well, isn't their argument
that this one instance

27:49.959 --> 27:52.625
could be the tip of the iceberg,
that they need to go

27:52.709 --> 27:55.417
through all the old trades
to see if there's a pattern?

27:55.500 --> 27:58.417
But that could take months.
It's harassment, Randy.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.917
They've already spent years

28:00.000 --> 28:00.917
going through
all those old trades,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.917
trying to make a case,
and they've failed.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.625
Now they've come up with this
story about me and sabotage,

28:06.709 --> 28:08.208
which you will see is false.

28:08.291 --> 28:09.959
Look, I shorted that company

28:10.041 --> 28:12.583
'cause I saw a faulty process
and bad financials,

28:12.667 --> 28:15.458
and I'm being penalized because
the markets agreed with me.

28:15.542 --> 28:16.500
I was set up.

28:16.583 --> 28:18.792
Now, soon you'll have
all these details,

28:18.875 --> 28:19.917
but what they are doing
right now

28:20.000 --> 28:23.625
is they're trying to ruin
not only my reputation

28:23.709 --> 28:26.250
but that of everyone
who works at Axe Capital,

28:26.333 --> 28:29.792
and that is the story
you should be digging into.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.125
Hi.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.417
Want dinner?

28:32.500 --> 28:35.375
Do we need to do that?

28:42.166 --> 28:43.542
Hey.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.166
On Axelrod, I could use to see
the transaction records

28:46.250 --> 28:48.250
of all the people
who bought or sold stock

28:48.333 --> 28:49.709
in the Ice Juice IPO,
the victims in this thing.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.000
You mean besides the people
who were poisoned?

28:52.083 --> 28:55.375
Yeah, they were about
the only ones who got paid.

28:55.458 --> 28:58.208
S.E.C. said you were holding
the records for some reason.

28:58.291 --> 28:59.959
I've got forensic
financial analysts

29:00.041 --> 29:01.458
combing through
all that now.

29:01.542 --> 29:04.375
I didn't want you to, uh,
bog down in those details.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.625
I like knowing
the minutiae in my cases.

29:06.709 --> 29:09.750
Good,
as I would expect you to.

29:09.834 --> 29:11.875
I'll get the results to you
ASAP.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.750
-Great.
-Okay.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.458
You know,
I was just wondering,

29:15.542 --> 29:17.667
who'd you get the initial tip
from that started all this?

29:17.750 --> 29:20.333
I should interview
him or her.

29:20.417 --> 29:22.625
I understand
why you're asking,

29:22.709 --> 29:25.000
but my tipster
is not exactly

29:25.083 --> 29:27.667
Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel.

29:27.750 --> 29:28.667
Just a foot soldier.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.792
It was enough info
to get the FBI going

29:30.875 --> 29:32.542
but not a firsthand witness.

29:32.625 --> 29:35.667
If there were material value,
I would share the name.

29:35.750 --> 29:37.750
Of course.
I know you would.

29:39.500 --> 29:43.083
I am glad that I asked Chuck
to send you to me.

29:43.166 --> 29:44.792
I need your expertise.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.834
Glad to be here, boss.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.667
Ugh. Don't call me "boss."
We're peers.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.500
In a hierarchy, yes,
but colleagues.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.250
Call me "Oliver."

29:54.333 --> 29:57.792
You got it.

29:57.875 --> 30:01.375
Never trust an officer
who doesn't ask you to salute.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.500
It means that
what he does demand of you

30:02.583 --> 30:04.709
is gonna be a lot worse.

30:04.792 --> 30:05.834
Dake.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.000
All of it.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.750
You know,
you're in law school now.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.875
How does this fact pattern
smell to you?

30:11.959 --> 30:13.959
I get transferred
to prosecute Axelrod,

30:14.041 --> 30:15.875
but then he puts
a blindfold on me.

30:15.959 --> 30:19.667
I can't access certain documents
or know who the tipster is?

30:19.750 --> 30:22.458
Well, there's nothing to be
done about it now, so...

30:22.542 --> 30:24.583
drinks?

30:37.959 --> 30:38.959
Again?

30:39.041 --> 30:40.542
Hmm.

30:40.625 --> 30:42.458
Have you tried blinking rapidly
100 times?

30:42.542 --> 30:44.333
Yeah, I've tried it all.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.667
We shouldn't have stopped
seeing her.

30:54.750 --> 30:55.458
When you leave things
unresolved,

30:55.542 --> 30:57.875
this is what happens.

30:57.959 --> 31:02.417
Mm. Maybe you're right.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.417
Let's make an appointment.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.542
I'm taking a walk.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.458
♪ I walked the town at night  ♪

31:21.542 --> 31:23.667
♪ Like a spade  ♪

31:23.750 --> 31:25.458
Chocolate egg cream, please.

31:25.542 --> 31:26.125
Coming right up.

31:26.208 --> 31:30.542
♪ I walked the night  ♪

31:30.625 --> 31:33.542
I thought I'd find you here.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.208
What do you want?

31:35.291 --> 31:39.333
I became single-minded
to the point of myopia.

31:39.417 --> 31:42.959
I know that I have
transgressed materially

31:43.041 --> 31:45.625
but, more importantly,
in terms of loyalty.

31:45.709 --> 31:48.709
I will devote myself
to the long and arduous process

31:48.792 --> 31:50.583
of making up for the latter.

31:50.667 --> 31:54.083
As to the former,
I have an offer for you.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.709
I have lined up a seat for you

31:57.792 --> 31:59.834
on the Theakston-Manley
asbestos trust,

31:59.917 --> 32:01.375
rubber-stamping claims.

32:01.458 --> 32:02.792
One meeting per quarter.

32:02.875 --> 32:05.834
Your fee, 350K a year.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.583
Now, that'll lead
to more similar seats

32:07.667 --> 32:09.917
once you impress people.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.834
You put together
three of these babies,

32:11.917 --> 32:13.333
that's a nice little
sinecure.

32:13.417 --> 32:15.667
Well, I was on my way
to being a zillionaire,

32:15.750 --> 32:17.166
and you're giving me
a sinecure.

32:19.709 --> 32:20.709
I understand
the rancor, Ira.

32:20.792 --> 32:23.208
I don't begrudge you it.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.959
And I hesitate to bring up

32:25.041 --> 32:26.959
what I know you already know,

32:27.041 --> 32:28.542
but I want to hear it from you

32:28.625 --> 32:29.667
now that the smoke
has cleared

32:29.750 --> 32:32.166
that you will not say a word
about my role in the IPO.

32:32.250 --> 32:36.500
You know that it's in your
best interest as well as mine,

32:36.583 --> 32:39.834
because that's how you'll get
paid off in your civil case.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.709
Well, I've been punting
my interview with Eastern

32:42.792 --> 32:44.917
as long as I can.
It'll go on the books soon.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.417
But, no, Chuck,
I won't say a word.

32:57.959 --> 33:03.125
Funny thing,
the egg cream, hmm?

33:03.208 --> 33:05.375
No egg in it,
no cream, either.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.667
Just chocolate syrup,

33:07.750 --> 33:10.291
a splash of milk, seltzer.

33:10.375 --> 33:14.041
I guess the French had a drink
called chocolat et crème.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.750
The American corruption for that
became "egg cream."

33:17.750 --> 33:20.583
Wonderful arcana.

33:20.667 --> 33:21.917
That's --
That's so Chuck of you.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.834
God, I used to love
that shit.

33:24.917 --> 33:27.291
Go home and write it
in my journal.

33:27.375 --> 33:30.709
Now that the smoke
has cleared,

33:30.792 --> 33:33.375
you need to hear something.

33:33.458 --> 33:34.792
I've realized...

33:34.875 --> 33:37.875
that you need all this,

33:37.959 --> 33:41.959
to put people
in impossible positions,

33:42.041 --> 33:43.458
to dominate with your will,

33:43.542 --> 33:46.417
to torture.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.667
I never think
in those terms.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.875
Well, you've forced me to.

33:49.959 --> 33:51.375
Let's talk it out.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.375
No, this is it.

33:53.458 --> 33:58.750
I'll never talk to you again
once this conversation's over,

33:58.834 --> 34:02.166
which it is.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.333
You coming in, nagusi?

34:39.417 --> 34:41.875
Nope. Case. All day.

34:41.959 --> 34:44.250
Something hot for Axe.
An iron condor with four--

34:44.333 --> 34:46.250
-Please. Go back to B school.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.583
How about a strangle where
we arb the vega on--

34:48.667 --> 34:50.125
You go back to fucking yourself.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.959
I just need two minutes
with Taylor.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.375
Everyone does.
You have to wait.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.667
-Hey, Wags, listen--
-Don't want to fucking hear it.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.959
Nope. As soon as.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.959
Yeah, well, be all over Taylor
till they figure it out.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.542
If I flame this dinner--

35:01.625 --> 35:02.875
No chance, sahabi.

35:02.959 --> 35:04.500
Never let it happen.

35:04.583 --> 35:06.917
Orrin, time for you
to go see your protégé.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.667
You want me
to propose the deal?

35:08.750 --> 35:11.333
I want you to remind him
what happens to guys like him

35:11.417 --> 35:12.834
when they take
this big a swing and miss.

35:12.917 --> 35:14.000
I want you to remind him

35:14.083 --> 35:16.834
that the political winds
have shifted.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.333
It's better if I show up
with something to offer.

35:18.417 --> 35:22.625
Then bring him a glass of
fuckin' milk, but go do it.

35:30.166 --> 35:31.875
Field trip. Come on.

35:31.959 --> 35:33.208
Where?

35:33.291 --> 35:35.709
Somewhere we can talk
without everyone coming at us.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.417
I know a place.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.875
Ever seen Eastern Promises?

35:48.959 --> 35:52.542
No. Have you ever been
to one of these idea dinners?

35:52.625 --> 35:55.000
No seconds in attendance.

35:59.125 --> 36:01.542
Ugh.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.625
Where are we on an idea?

36:06.709 --> 36:09.792
Haven't fully cracked
the big one yet.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.417
Trying.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.542
Are you?

36:12.625 --> 36:13.375
Trying?

36:14.834 --> 36:18.417
Ask the real question.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.458
Are you shopping offers
on the street?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.500
Just to get it
out of the way,

36:25.583 --> 36:28.750
let me apologize for anything
that might have offended

36:28.834 --> 36:29.417
at the poker tournament.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.417
Now that I'm at Treasury,

36:30.500 --> 36:33.959
I need to find someone
to steward my firm.

36:34.041 --> 36:37.041
I'm already stewarding
a firm, a bigger one.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.625
Not that size matters.

36:38.709 --> 36:42.500
Right.

36:42.583 --> 36:45.917
Whatever Axe's flaws,
one thing he knows is people,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.417
and if he believes
you can do it well,

36:48.500 --> 36:49.667
I believe you can.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.834
And I'd actually be
hands off.

36:51.917 --> 36:53.959
Let you operate
as you saw fit.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.583
That's my situation now.

36:55.667 --> 36:58.500
Is it?

37:02.709 --> 37:04.208
I said no.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.709
With finality

37:05.792 --> 37:08.041
or as a negotiating ploy?

37:08.125 --> 37:10.917
Look, I know it's Axe's faith
that confers value on me

37:11.000 --> 37:12.750
until I have
a track record of my own,

37:12.834 --> 37:15.291
until others actually see
what I can do.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.792
So I am loyal to him.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.709
Until and unless it becomes
necessary, I will not leave.

37:19.792 --> 37:21.291
All right.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.458
You can take the heat.
I believe you.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.792
Such disrespect.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.500
Look at you,
sitting here with your tits out.

37:38.333 --> 37:41.166
You got a problem
with my tits?

37:41.250 --> 37:45.625
Or maybe
they're turning you on

37:45.709 --> 37:47.625
and that's the problem.

37:51.291 --> 37:53.875
You know, I could have done
that for myself.

37:53.959 --> 37:56.208
I know.
I wanted the release.

37:56.291 --> 37:59.625
It was even better
than a hand job.

37:59.709 --> 38:03.208
You chose to meet here
in the anteroom

38:03.291 --> 38:05.000
instead of the dining room.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.500
I seem to have lost
my appetite lately.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.583
-Hmm.
-And, no, it's not my health.

38:10.667 --> 38:11.667
Full workup.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.709
Radiology fine,
bloodwork perfect.

38:14.792 --> 38:15.792
Heart, too.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.041
Still, nothing
wants to stay down.

38:18.125 --> 38:20.583
So, what's got your duodenum
inside out?

38:20.667 --> 38:21.667
Want a hint?

38:21.750 --> 38:24.208
His name
is the same as mine.

38:24.291 --> 38:27.291
Oh, that boy is a feisty one,
there's no denying that.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.041
What he is
is unfit for office,

38:30.125 --> 38:31.417
unfit to run, even.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.125
I came here
to tell you that I am sorry

38:34.208 --> 38:36.583
I asked you
to put him forward.

38:36.667 --> 38:37.875
It was a mistake.

38:37.959 --> 38:41.583
And I will throw my full weight
behind whomever it is

38:41.667 --> 38:42.500
that you say I should.

38:42.583 --> 38:46.208
-Well, that's disheartening.
-It is.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.667
I hate delivering the message,
but I owe it to you.

38:48.750 --> 38:49.959
The candidate's
too volatile.

38:50.041 --> 38:51.166
He's unpredictable,

38:51.250 --> 38:53.667
a liability to all of us.

38:53.750 --> 38:54.917
Oh, Charles.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.834
For a father to speak
that way of his own son.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.291
I myself will pass up
supper tonight.

38:59.375 --> 39:02.625
That's how disappointing
I find this.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.417
So you understand?

39:04.500 --> 39:08.125
Not in the way
you hope I might.

39:08.208 --> 39:11.417
I have had this
in my possession,

39:11.500 --> 39:14.083
hoping not to be forced
to use it.

39:14.166 --> 39:17.291
But I cannot stand by

39:17.375 --> 39:20.083
and watch you run
that young man down.

39:20.166 --> 39:22.208
You used his money,
Charles,

39:22.291 --> 39:24.542
without his consent,
I might add,

39:24.625 --> 39:26.709
to invest in something
so risky

39:26.792 --> 39:28.500
as to almost be the ruin
of both of you.

39:28.583 --> 39:33.041
Now, I believe Chuck
will not only survive it

39:33.125 --> 39:34.000
but that the ruthlessness
he has shown

39:34.083 --> 39:36.083
these past few months

39:36.166 --> 39:39.291
will serve him well
on our shared mission,

39:39.375 --> 39:42.709
making him governor
of this great state.

39:42.792 --> 39:45.166
I'd like you
to embrace it.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.959
But you at least
have to accept it.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.959
Hmm.

39:50.041 --> 39:53.792
I accept nothing
when it comes to that boy.

39:53.875 --> 39:57.041
We'll see.

40:04.041 --> 40:09.000
Hello, Dad.

40:09.083 --> 40:11.750
Ah, let's all get
our appetites back, hmm?

40:11.834 --> 40:14.500
Together.
What do you say, Charles?

40:14.583 --> 40:18.291
This is a bridge too far,
Black Jack.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.125
This is a bridge

40:20.208 --> 40:22.667
too fucking far.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.375
Ah, he'll come 'round.

40:31.458 --> 40:35.417
I've seen this play
a thousand times.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.542
By the time
the curtain comes down,

40:38.625 --> 40:42.000
he'll take your hand,
and you'll share the bow.

40:42.959 --> 40:45.458
I don't know.

40:45.542 --> 40:49.000
Well, what's meant to happen
always does.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.000
Let's eat.
I'm fuckin' famished.

41:16.625 --> 41:20.542
That's some serious
fucking topspin.

41:20.625 --> 41:21.542
You putting sneakers on
for a match,

41:21.625 --> 41:25.208
or you come up here
with a specific proposal?

41:25.291 --> 41:26.709
Axe'll wait you out,

41:26.792 --> 41:30.959
no matter how long you manage
to keep the money frozen.

41:31.041 --> 41:32.709
He won't make a deal.

41:32.792 --> 41:34.333
We'll find out, huh?

41:34.417 --> 41:36.792
What's it going to be, Bryan?

41:36.875 --> 41:37.959
Pistols at dawn?

41:38.041 --> 41:40.083
Fists?

41:40.166 --> 41:42.625
You insist on picking
through every transaction,

41:42.709 --> 41:44.542
he'll embarrass you.

41:44.625 --> 41:45.709
Embarrassment is free.

41:45.792 --> 41:46.709
We'll cost your client
a fortune

41:46.792 --> 41:49.917
keeping his money
out of play for half a year,

41:50.000 --> 41:51.208
maybe his whole fortune.

41:51.291 --> 41:53.125
You can't even count
that high.

41:53.208 --> 41:54.375
It doesn't matter.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.583
The case has no support
in D.C.

41:56.667 --> 41:59.083
It used to,
but all that's changed.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.458
This is exactly
the type of matter

42:01.542 --> 42:04.041
the A.G. is walking
away from these days.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.208
No. No.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.083
He's walking away
from insider trading,

42:08.166 --> 42:09.875
funny accounting,
all sorts of shit,

42:09.959 --> 42:10.834
but the reason he can

42:10.917 --> 42:12.542
is because a case like this
gives him cover.

42:12.625 --> 42:15.792
People care about it
on a visceral level

42:15.875 --> 42:17.417
because it's about sabotage,

42:17.500 --> 42:20.542
breaking the public trust,
hurting the average guy twice,

42:20.625 --> 42:21.959
once
with the tainted juice,

42:22.041 --> 42:24.000
and a second time
with the stock pricing.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.083
How's that
for serious fucking topspin?

42:27.166 --> 42:29.041
You want us to ease off,

42:29.125 --> 42:31.375
you have to give something
in return.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.667
I understand your position,

42:34.750 --> 42:35.458
and at this time,

42:35.542 --> 42:39.166
I don't have
anything to offer.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.458
Then maybe wait until you do

42:41.542 --> 42:46.458
before wasting
my fucking time.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.959
Bach almost offered up
Axe's ability to trade.

42:53.041 --> 42:54.291
I felt it.

42:54.375 --> 42:58.208
Either he wasn't authorized,
or he sensed weakness.

42:58.291 --> 42:59.959
Did you show weakness?

43:00.041 --> 43:01.333
I did not.

43:01.417 --> 43:04.041
You have some scouting report
on me saying that I did?

43:04.125 --> 43:04.583
It was just a question.

43:04.667 --> 43:07.417
A better question is

43:07.500 --> 43:08.417
which is Axelrod
going to bet on,

43:08.500 --> 43:11.500
his present or his future?

43:11.583 --> 43:14.125
A man who believes
he'll win at trial

43:14.208 --> 43:15.291
sits calmly on the sideline
for six months

43:15.375 --> 43:17.667
until his money is unfrozen,

43:17.750 --> 43:20.166
and then he prevails in court,
goes on with his life.

43:20.250 --> 43:23.000
But a man who thinks he's going
to lose that trial?

43:23.083 --> 43:25.333
Well, he's desperate
to get his money

43:25.417 --> 43:26.625
back in the game
as soon as possible

43:26.709 --> 43:29.458
because he sees it
all going away.

43:29.542 --> 43:31.667
Him giving up trading

43:31.750 --> 43:34.250
would necessitate
a reinvention of who he is.

43:34.333 --> 43:37.000
I've seen him
walk away from the table

43:37.083 --> 43:38.083
on an impulse

43:38.166 --> 43:40.166
when we were certain
that only a deal

43:40.250 --> 43:41.667
would keep him
out of prison.

43:41.750 --> 43:44.000
No one gets where he got
by acting only on impulse.

43:44.083 --> 43:47.792
When it comes to billionaires
and Bobby Axelrod in particular,

43:47.875 --> 43:50.250
the thing
you got to understand is...

43:50.333 --> 43:51.542
they're meat-eaters.

43:51.625 --> 43:55.583
The only win they can live with
is total, present and future.

43:55.667 --> 43:57.375
If he gave up trading
and got his money back,

43:57.458 --> 43:59.875
it'd be because he believed

43:59.959 --> 44:03.208
he was gonna kick
our asses at trial.

44:03.291 --> 44:06.667
He expects to get all of it,
everything.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.291
That's who he is.

44:08.375 --> 44:10.041
But still,
we keep the pressure on.

44:10.125 --> 44:14.834
See if he makes a mistake
now that it's all on the line.

44:14.917 --> 44:16.542
And then,
no matter what he does,

44:16.625 --> 44:19.083
we have to
position ourselves

44:19.166 --> 44:21.625
to claim victory.

44:30.291 --> 44:31.875
Here, boy.

44:35.208 --> 44:37.000
Okay, break it down for me.

44:37.083 --> 44:39.875
We are the Czechoslovakian
gymnastics team in the '70s.

44:39.959 --> 44:42.083
A lot of pride
for what this country was,

44:42.166 --> 44:44.333
but if something doesn't change
soon, defections are coming.

44:44.417 --> 44:47.667
How'd Taylor do?

44:47.750 --> 44:49.083
Fine.

44:49.166 --> 44:51.917
-I'm not asking you to rat.
-I mean, you are.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.458
Well, I won't tell anyone
it came from you, but--

44:54.542 --> 44:56.709
It was a shit show.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.792
Yeah. Get me Taylor,
Wags, and Wendy.

45:04.166 --> 45:06.875
Why the fuck did you lead
the first morning meeting back

45:06.959 --> 45:08.125
without Wendy there
to handle the troops?

45:08.208 --> 45:11.250
-Taylor handled it, as well--
-I'm talking to both of you,

45:11.333 --> 45:14.125
and from what "Dollar Bill"
tells me, it was a shit show.

45:14.208 --> 45:16.458
-Hey, you ratted.
-I pay for the information.

45:16.542 --> 45:18.291
It's mine to use.
That's how it goes.

45:20.041 --> 45:23.917
Wendy wasn't here.
She was with you, I gather.

45:24.000 --> 45:24.959
We needed ideas.
We needed to come together --

45:25.041 --> 45:27.834
So you made a bad thing worse
by jumping in

45:27.917 --> 45:29.709
before you had a plan, and --
-No, Axe.

45:29.792 --> 45:30.500
It wouldn't have mattered
who was in the room

45:30.583 --> 45:31.667
with the PMs
and the traders.

45:31.750 --> 45:33.709
It was always gonna be
a shit show

45:33.792 --> 45:34.458
if the message wasn't
"We're liquid again."

45:34.542 --> 45:37.250
-Hallelujah.
-Don't be an ass.

45:37.333 --> 45:38.500
You're right.

45:38.583 --> 45:40.667
I meant Axe,
but you, too, Bill.

45:40.750 --> 45:41.917
Will you leave us alone
for a minute?

45:45.875 --> 45:48.959
Whoever you're trying
to destroy, stop.

45:49.041 --> 45:51.709
You need to focus
on fighting for your freedom.

45:51.792 --> 45:54.709
You know what
you're suggesting I do.

45:54.792 --> 45:57.208
The one thing
you can  do right now.

45:57.291 --> 45:59.750
You taught me an average trader
makes a trade and feels good.

45:59.834 --> 46:02.500
A great trader makes a trade
and feels nothing,

46:02.583 --> 46:04.750
as in be cold and act.

46:04.834 --> 46:05.709
Don't get hung up on emotion.

46:05.792 --> 46:08.500
Give up trading
till the case is over.

46:08.583 --> 46:12.125
You get it back if you win.

46:12.208 --> 46:14.583
If you lose,
you've got bigger problems.

46:14.667 --> 46:17.000
Let them trade for you,
then feed the press a line

46:17.083 --> 46:19.333
about how it proves
the government has no case.

46:19.417 --> 46:23.709
Unless you're worried about
something harder to admit,

46:23.792 --> 46:27.583
that Taylor will be the public
face of Axe Cap and not you.

46:27.667 --> 46:28.625
It's Theseus's Ship.

46:28.709 --> 46:31.125
Once you change out the sails
and all the planks

46:31.208 --> 46:33.542
that make up the hull,
whose ship is it?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.500
Yeah. You got it.

46:35.583 --> 46:38.208
As long as it's your money,

46:38.291 --> 46:39.250
it is still Axe Capital,

46:39.333 --> 46:42.875
no matter who's making
the day-to-day decisions.

46:42.959 --> 46:44.667
Are you sure?

46:44.750 --> 46:49.291
It's not me
that has to be sure.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.709
I'm holding in my hand

47:03.792 --> 47:06.333
Robert Axelrod's signature
relinquishing his ability

47:06.417 --> 47:07.709
to trade securities.

47:07.792 --> 47:10.750
He gave it up.

47:10.834 --> 47:12.792
Well...

47:12.875 --> 47:16.667
ol' Samson
got a real buzz cut.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.875
Uh, we need to get
our version out right away.

47:18.959 --> 47:20.583
I've already taken steps.

47:20.667 --> 47:22.583
A.G. on the phone.

47:22.667 --> 47:24.834
Got to go, Ollie.

47:27.917 --> 47:28.875
Rhoades.

47:28.959 --> 47:30.458
Is this really the attorney
of the United States

47:30.542 --> 47:32.709
for the southern district?

47:32.792 --> 47:33.750
Am I that lucky?

47:33.834 --> 47:36.166
There must be streams
in the desert.

47:36.250 --> 47:37.083
General, a pleasure.

47:37.166 --> 47:40.750
Your predecessor called
once a term.

47:40.834 --> 47:42.667
I'm in the habit
of counting the herd

47:42.750 --> 47:44.250
at the end of the day,
Chuck.

47:44.333 --> 47:44.917
Sure.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.417
Eastern had a good day today.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.166
Axelrod's put his office keys
on Dake's desk.

47:50.250 --> 47:51.375
Good for them.

47:51.458 --> 47:52.875
But you're calling
because you want to make sure

47:52.959 --> 47:54.625
that I have adjusted
the priorities.

47:54.709 --> 47:57.083
Pass the message along.

47:57.166 --> 47:57.667
I'm a thorough man.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.375
As am I. It's done.

48:00.458 --> 48:02.959
Attaboy.

48:03.041 --> 48:04.709
I'll eagerly await
our next chat.

48:12.291 --> 48:13.959
Hey, you boys ready to go?

48:14.041 --> 48:15.500
Daddy's got to head out.

48:15.583 --> 48:16.458
-See ya, fellas.
-Later.

48:16.542 --> 48:19.125
Go wait in the car.
I'll be right down.

48:22.208 --> 48:24.625
Your office said
the money's unfrozen.

48:24.709 --> 48:25.875
Yeah, I told 'em
to call you.

48:25.959 --> 48:28.750
Should I have it wired
to Birch?

48:28.834 --> 48:29.959
No, Bobby.

48:30.041 --> 48:33.166
I pictured you two
running around together.

48:33.250 --> 48:35.083
That fuckin' starter plane
of his.

48:35.166 --> 48:37.792
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that sardine can.

48:44.208 --> 48:45.125
The money, Bobby.

48:47.667 --> 48:50.125
Just don't fuckin'
lose it.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.875
Now, there's one bitter
thing that we have to swallow

48:53.959 --> 48:55.959
along with
this delicious lo mein.

48:56.041 --> 48:59.834
We have to slow down
on a couple of cases.

49:05.834 --> 49:07.417
You like giving up
those cases?

49:07.500 --> 49:09.291
-I hate it.
-Me, too.

49:09.375 --> 49:13.500
No A.G. picks our cases.
I'm chafing against it.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.333
I'm chafed.

49:15.417 --> 49:17.375
So, are we gonna do
something about it?

49:17.458 --> 49:19.333
When I know, you'll know.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.000
IoT, you know?

49:24.083 --> 49:25.583
Sure, Internet of Things.

49:25.667 --> 49:27.166
When companies
that make appliances

49:27.250 --> 49:29.500
and digital thermostats
contract with the firms

49:29.583 --> 49:31.625
that manufacture the microchips
to make their products smart,

49:31.709 --> 49:34.041
the connected things inside,

49:34.125 --> 49:36.583
they force the chip companies
to sign nondisclosures.

49:36.667 --> 49:37.792
They don't want
their competitors

49:37.875 --> 49:40.834
to be able to mimic them.
-Right, so it's hard to know

49:40.917 --> 49:43.500
which chip companies are poised
to dominate the market.

49:43.583 --> 49:44.875
My theory: If we could find
a common component

49:44.959 --> 49:47.417
among a bunch
of varied devices--

49:47.500 --> 49:48.709
You could
reverse-engineer it.

49:48.792 --> 49:51.000
You have fun
smashing shit apart?

49:51.083 --> 49:51.917
A blast.
And I found a component

49:52.000 --> 49:53.959
that matched the specs
for a Quartes chip.

49:54.041 --> 49:57.083
So I called Quartes
and claimed to be building

49:57.166 --> 49:59.000
an Internet-connected
washing machine

49:59.083 --> 50:00.959
that sends a message to the
owner when the laundry is done.

50:01.041 --> 50:03.000
Got the full specs
on their latest chips.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.500
-And they matched.
-That they did.

50:05.583 --> 50:08.458
Everyone tries to hide it,
but Quartes is the main supplier

50:08.542 --> 50:10.709
for 85% of IoT products
on the market.

50:10.792 --> 50:12.041
So, that's the shot?

50:12.125 --> 50:13.083
That's the shot.

50:13.166 --> 50:16.000
It plays.
Good work.

50:16.083 --> 50:18.417
You'd have found something
like it if you weren't--

50:18.500 --> 50:19.291
That's why I have you, Taylor.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.917
It's a good thing
that you can deliver

50:21.000 --> 50:23.375
when I can't,
not a bad thing.

50:23.458 --> 50:23.917
Thank you.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.250
Once you leave here,

50:25.333 --> 50:27.083
we can't really talk
individual names

50:27.166 --> 50:28.041
of companies again
for a long time.

50:28.125 --> 50:31.417
Management issues, sure,
but not stocks.

50:31.500 --> 50:32.792
It'll all be up to you.

50:32.875 --> 50:35.125
I can't be seen
to be guiding the firm.

50:35.208 --> 50:37.875
It'll look as though I'm
violating the terms of my deal.

50:37.959 --> 50:40.083
I know. You saved the firm
by doing what you did.

50:40.166 --> 50:41.917
We bought back into the market
late in the position.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.333
Tonight's a big one for me.

50:51.333 --> 50:54.667
The most important managers
in the business will be there.

50:54.750 --> 50:57.583
Between them, they cover
all the meaningful strategies

50:57.667 --> 50:59.834
currently in play.

51:01.959 --> 51:03.083
Quite the cotillion.

51:03.166 --> 51:06.125
It's the social event
of the season.

51:06.208 --> 51:09.500
Tonight plants our flag
for the future.

51:09.583 --> 51:11.291
This room will set the agenda
for what the industry's

51:11.375 --> 51:14.792
talking about for
the next week, month, year.

51:14.875 --> 51:17.750
And what they will be talking
about is Axe Capital.

54:14.083 --> 54:16.834
Barely 30 years old.

54:16.917 --> 54:19.834
-Oh, yeah, he's ripped.

54:19.917 --> 54:21.625
Tell me!

54:21.709 --> 54:22.750
That's how you want
to be punished?

54:22.834 --> 54:26.166
Yes! Yes!

54:26.250 --> 54:30.458
It's -- It's the most
excruciating thing

54:30.542 --> 54:31.542
that I can think of.

54:31.625 --> 54:33.417
I want to know
what he does to you,

54:33.500 --> 54:35.417
what you do to him.

54:38.333 --> 54:39.625
We're somewhere private.

54:39.709 --> 54:42.500
-A hotel.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.792
White sheets thrown around us.

54:44.875 --> 54:45.834
Our clothes are off.

54:48.959 --> 54:52.166
Hands and mouths on bare skin.

54:52.250 --> 54:54.500
I take him in my hands.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.709
Is he--

54:57.792 --> 54:59.542
Yeah, hard.

54:59.625 --> 55:01.458
Thick.

55:01.542 --> 55:03.333
I give myself to him

55:03.417 --> 55:08.750
and let him do
whatever he wants.

55:08.834 --> 55:11.667
Is it good?

55:11.750 --> 55:15.542
Good? No.
It's fucking amazing.

55:19.959 --> 55:22.083
He understands me.

55:22.166 --> 55:27.291
He knows exactly what I need.

55:55.166 --> 55:56.917
I'd love to agree, but I think
he bested those fuckers,

What else does he need?

56:03.917 --> 56:06.583
To do with as he pleases.
But what's the fucking point?

56:06.667 --> 56:08.375
He's gonna be here soon.

56:08.458 --> 56:11.041
We're gonna know by the look

Chief Investment Officer,
Axe Capital,

56:28.709 --> 56:33.375
and I have a silver-backed
fucking gorilla of an idea.

56:33.458 --> 56:35.917
It's an angle of attack
on an Internet sector

56:36.000 --> 56:38.250
that's worth 12X
what you think it is.

56:38.333 --> 56:39.458
But the sector
is only the beginning.

56:39.542 --> 56:42.458
I'll walk you through
both the technical side

56:42.542 --> 56:44.834
and the types of derivatives
that are available

56:44.917 --> 56:46.125
to both bet on it
and to effectively hedge it

56:46.208 --> 56:49.291
so that the play
is risk-neutral.

56:52.208 --> 56:56.291
That's how Axe Cap is doing it.
