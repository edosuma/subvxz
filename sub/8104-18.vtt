WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:09.133
Did I say
anything stupid?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.679
I had two drinks.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.139
Three.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.976
- Okay. There was that last one also.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.772
It's okay. Someday you'll be pregnant
and you can return the favor.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.278
- I feel like such an idiot sometimes.
- No.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.949
You know, when the baby comes,
I am gonna be...

00:33.075 --> 00:35.993
You know what?
You're gonna be so great.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.829
You are.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.756
Hey!

00:55.723 --> 00:57.265
- You all right?
- Uh. Uh-huh.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.143
Oh, no.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.277
You know why
I pulled you over?

01:09.403 --> 01:12.530
I'm so sorry, Officer.
I must have dozed off.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.323
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.616
Of course she hasn't.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.996
- Somebody has.
- I've been drinking.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.166
You all right?
I'm not...

01:23.584 --> 01:27.295
- How far along are you?
- Almost...

01:27.421 --> 01:29.756
Ma'am, step out
of the vehicle.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.554
Ma'am, walk to the rear of the car.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.889
Naomi.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.475
Naomi?

01:44.980 --> 01:46.439
- Naomi.
- Sir, remain in the car.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.816
- listen. She's not drunk, all right?
- I will arrest you, sir.

01:48.942 --> 01:49.984
She's sick!
Just look at her.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.277
Can you roll me another unit?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.154
Get back in the car.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.824
Naomi! Get off.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.286
Call an ambulance.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.448
The good news is
it doesn't look like a stroke.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.158
No bleeds, no clots.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.494
- Thank God.
- It sounds like there's bad news.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.580
We got your blood work back.
Some things are a little off.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.457
Your liver and kidneys
aren't working so well.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.459
Why? What would
cause that?

02:48.585 --> 02:51.170
It's preeclampsia, isn't it?
I'm gonna miscarry, aren't I?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.005
Preeclampsia is
a possibility.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.215
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.676
I've miscarried
three times. I'm 39.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.886
We had to use in vitro.
Make sure the baby's okay.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.389
Let's make sure
that you're okay first.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.642
How about we take
care of both of you at the same time?

03:05.894 --> 03:09.146
The nurse will be in soon to take some
blood. I'd like to run more tests.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.148
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.028
- Where is everybody?
- No one's in the office?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.072
No. I haven't heard
from Cameron all day.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.240
You seen House?

03:19.366 --> 03:22.243
Look for a shallow grave
with Vogler standing over it.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.543
You have a
stage IV cancer.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.047
It's metastasized
to your liver.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.470
There's a new
drug called 8C12

03:41.597 --> 03:44.432
that's shown promise
in Phase II trials.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.144
- It's your best shot.
- Thank you, Doctor.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.814
You've been
so good to me.

03:51.940 --> 03:56.694
Well, I did publicly
bash your company's drug.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.113
When I think about
how I treated you...

03:59.323 --> 04:01.490
Oh, hey. Come on.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.203
There, there, there.

04:11.710 --> 04:16.255
- So, there is some hope.
- Always.

04:16.381 --> 04:20.593
But just in case, I special-ordered
an extra-jumbo-sized coffin.

04:20.761 --> 04:25.765
- Hey.
- Don't thank me. It's just who I am.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.266
Hey!

04:27.392 --> 04:28.726
Up and at them, big guy.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.233
Sorry. Up late.
Internet porn.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.318
How come you're
not in your office?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.320
Because there is
a computer in my office.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.115
If I log on, romance will ensue.
My wrist might fall off.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.035
Hiding 'cause Vogler's
looking for you, huh?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.370
That's just pathetic.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.873
I don't like loud, angry giants
threatening me with violence.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.832
How is that pathetic?

04:51.959 --> 04:55.294
You think you can avoid firing
one of us by hiding out here?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.714
- He'll find you sooner or later.
- I'm okay with later.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.759
39-year-old female,
28 weeks pregnant.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.638
- G, four. P, zero.
- Three miscarriages?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.057
- Give me.
- Altered mental status

05:08.183 --> 05:09.558
and complete loss
of coordination.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.019
- Tox screen?
- Negative for alcohol and drugs.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.271
- She was on oxybutynin.
- For incontinence.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.856
Yeah, but we took
her off. No change.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.818
BUN and creatinine are up.
LFT's slightly elevated.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.737
Preeclampsia.
Call the ob-gyn service

05:21.863 --> 05:25.116
- and rub some prayer beads.
- BP's normal.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.826
No preeclampsia
in other pregnancies.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.703
Because she didn't carry
for long enough.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.289
The three miscarriages make me think
it's an underlying physiology.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.834
Pregnancy-related
autoimmunity.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.713
Too bad that
Cameron quit.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.132
We could use
an immunologist right now.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.384
We'll see if you're right.
Check the blood.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.053
- Cameron quit?
- Last night.

05:47.097 --> 05:52.059
- And do an MRA for vasculitis, too.
- There's no way she quit.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.229
She got fired because
you couldn't swallow your pride.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.566
An ultrasound?
Excellent thought.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.402
And put her on magnesium too,
in case it is preeclampsia.

06:02.738 --> 06:03.863
Sure.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.378
Here, pussy,
pussy, pussy.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.505
I didn't do anything.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.049
Exactly my point.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.009
You wanted me
to yell at him?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.177
What the hell would
that have achieved?

06:26.303 --> 06:28.971
Was he gonna jump into his time machine
and fix everything?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.264
When a dog dumps
on the floor,

06:30.390 --> 06:31.849
do you pat its head
and call it a genius?

06:31.975 --> 06:33.809
No. You smack it in the nose
with a newspaper.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.270
Dogs can learn things.
House can't.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.272
- Coward.
- Child.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.025
Hey, there.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.944
I brought my colleague
along to help out.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.572
- Hi. I'm Dr. Chase.
- Hi.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.497
Well, ultrasound looks good.
No sign of fetal distress.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.998
So it's not preeclampsia?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.543
Well, it still could be,
but it hasn't progressed at least.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.629
We're gonna put you on bed rest
and monitor the baby.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.880
Okay.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.508
We'll give you some potassium
and magnesium as well.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.384
So, we should keep
the fluids running for now,

07:07.511 --> 07:09.929
and check her again in an hour unless
there are signs of fetal distress.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.555
Honey?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.933
- She's choking!
- Lean forward.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.685
What...
Is she all right? Is it...

07:16.812 --> 07:17.937
Probably just
some muscle weakness.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.272
- What do you mean "probably"?
- Naomi, open up.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.941
People choke.
It could be nothing.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.113
You all right?

07:29.908 --> 07:32.910
I can't... I can't...
I can't even swallow.

07:37.124 --> 07:41.627
She gets sick a lot, but this
cold got really bad all of a sudden.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.129
And the fever...

07:45.715 --> 07:48.342
- It's okay.
- It's not a cold.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.302
It's pneumonia.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.221
- Pneumonia?
- Relax.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.265
Pneumonia's her
second biggest problem.

07:55.433 --> 08:00.938
She has gone from the 25th weight
percentile to the third in one month.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.273
I'm not a baby expert,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.066
but I'm pretty sure
they're not supposed to shrink.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.236
Well, there's this diet we put her
on when she stopped breast-feeding.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.197
But it's healthy.
Raw food. We're vegans.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.742
- Almond milk, tofu, vegetables.
- Raw food.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.787
If only her ancestors
had mastered the secret of fire.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.957
Babies need fat,
proteins, calories.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.209
Less important,
sprouts and hemp.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.463
Starving babies is bad
and illegal in many cultures.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.550
- I'm having her admitted.
- Is she gonna be all right?

08:29.759 --> 08:33.137
Antibiotics for the pneumonia,
IV feeding to get the weight up.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.472
Don't worry.
It's a vegan IV.

08:47.027 --> 08:51.155
Don't see any signs of vasculitis.
Odd.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.199
Since you're always
right about everything.

08:53.325 --> 08:57.119
Could be a different autoimmunity.
Or you could bite me.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.080
Oh, no.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.749
Naomi, you okay?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.126
No. I'm getting cramps.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.590
- Strong?
- Yeah. Feels like my miscarriage.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.926
- Stop.
- Preterm labor.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.469
He's too little.
He won't survive.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.762
She's on
magnesium already.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.138
Fluids and terbutaline then.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.682
We're gonna give you some medicine,
okay? Try to stop your labor.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.601
Okay. Okay.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.416
Oh!

09:45.335 --> 09:48.087
There you are. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.382
Listen, you said
that I had to cut one of my people

09:51.508 --> 09:53.926
if I didn't give that
speech about your drug.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.763
And in fairness to
your point of view,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.723
my speech really
wasn't the one you had in mind,

09:59.849 --> 10:01.058
so I've cut Cameron.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.396
Now we're all squared away,
right?

10:07.565 --> 10:10.901
In the morning,
I expect you in my office

10:11.027 --> 10:12.403
with your letter
of resignation

10:12.529 --> 10:16.907
and plans for a public apology,
otherwise I'll destroy you.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.956
So, that's a no
on us being squared away?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.220
She might
make it to full term.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.723
Contractions are less frequent
and not well organized.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.933
Great to see you
back in the office.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.144
I guess Vogler
found you?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.896
Yeah. We had
a nice little chat.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.024
I really should
have kept Cameron.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.358
She knew where
to find the sugar.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.485
It's what I said,
preeclampsia.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.988
A little stress from the MRA,
she pops right into labor.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.159
What about the myasthenia?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.452
Come on.
She didn't seem that weak.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.245
She choked.
She couldn't even swallow.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.165
- What did she choke on?
- Her food.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.876
But muscle weakness
isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.128
- What kind of food?
- A little bit of cooked pear.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.671
It doesn't matter.
It shows weakness.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.257
She choked on soft, wet pear?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.259
Did she forget
to take the bones out?

11:17.385 --> 11:21.096
That's way past muscle weakness.
Did you do an upper endoscopy?

11:21.222 --> 11:24.475
You think there's something
obstructing her esophagus?

11:24.601 --> 11:28.354
- We gotta talk.
- Oh. We gotta talk.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.192
And check her eyelids.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.402
Check her eyelids?

11:36.196 --> 11:40.074
Special board meeting today.
Only one item on the agenda, you.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.118
Well, enjoy the bagels.
I'm untouchable.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.204
Right.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.706
Any vote to revoke
my tenure has to be unanimous.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.375
I've got you and
maybe even Cuddy.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.002
Well, that settles it.
Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider

11:52.128 --> 11:53.837
will be totally
stymied, go home,

11:53.963 --> 11:55.714
curl up on the floor
of his shower and weep.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.383
What can he do?
I got a contract.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.301
Does it say how
much your team is paid,

11:59.427 --> 12:00.844
where your parking space is,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.763
and if your car should be
filled with horse manure?

12:03.181 --> 12:06.475
Vogler's smart.
He's got some plan to get you.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.645
Does it involve candy?
'Cause I'm a sucker for chocolates.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.910
- She's doing better.
- Oh, thank God.

12:25.036 --> 12:28.747
Technically, Alexander Fleming.
He developed antibiotics.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.416
Pneumonia's under control.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.627
But from now on,
let's say you go with human food, okay?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.047
- Absolutely. Swear to God.
- This time, that's your guy.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.218
Rachel and Joel Kaplan?

12:41.344 --> 12:43.554
- Yes?
- You're under arrest.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.806
- You have the right to remain silent.
- What did we do?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.641
You're being charged
with child endangerment.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.892
What? How?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.061
Starving your kid.
I'm from Social Services.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.106
We're taking responsibility
for your baby.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.989
This is how Vogler's
gonna destroy me?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.740
What did he do?
Grease your cane?

13:03.867 --> 13:05.367
He had my
patients arrested.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.870
No, he didn't.
I did.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.080
The nurses were concerned
and they called me.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.748
There was evidence
of abuse.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.668
You took a big legal risk
by not calling Social Services.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.254
Those parents are not abusive.
They're idiots.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.381
Oh, well,
that's certainly a relief.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.925
- It was my call.
- You made the wrong one.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.637
You know,
there's a new biography of Quisling.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.432
- I think you might like it.
- Sure. No idea who that is.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.186
Norwegian guy,
World War II, traitor.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.688
The fact that I have to explain this
kind of takes the edge off my flow.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.772
I was protecting you.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.442
From what?
Cops aren't gonna bust me.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.069
Disciplinary Committee
maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.113
And Vogler has an excuse
to get rid of you.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.365
If I don't give him one,
he makes one up.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.034
Vogler's just one vote.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.620
He's gotta convince
the other 11 of us.

13:49.746 --> 13:53.415
I'm just trying to stop you
from making that extra easy.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.298
Dr. Charles, dial 4541.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.094
Sean, do your wife's eyelids
look any different than usual?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.641
Maybe one is drooping
a little bit,

14:10.767 --> 14:12.809
but, you know,
she's tired, so...

14:16.064 --> 14:19.650
Naomi, can you open your mouth for me
and tilt your head back?

14:19.776 --> 14:22.361
This is gonna be
a little uncomfortable.

14:28.159 --> 14:32.454
Yeah. There's swelling
indenting the esophagus.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.082
- Is that why she choked?
- We'll need to do an X-ray.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.292
What? No. The baby...
You said no X-rays.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.794
It's important.

14:39.212 --> 14:43.131
She has a three-centimeter mass
in her right upper lobe.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.716
Maybe it's a granuloma.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.219
No. There's no calcification.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.978
It's small-cell
lung cancer.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.107
The tumor's starting
to press against your esophagus.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.025
It hasn't metastasized,

15:02.151 --> 15:03.986
but it has spread
to other parts of your lung,

15:04.112 --> 15:05.404
so we can't operate.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.114
Wait.
That doesn't make sense.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.866
She had kidney failure
and brain problems.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.410
Some cancer patients

15:11.536 --> 15:14.955
get what are called
paraneoplastic syndromes.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.583
You were making antibodies
to fight the tumor.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.876
They got sidetracked
and attacked other cells.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.505
Your brain first,
then your liver, kidneys,

15:23.631 --> 15:25.882
even the nerves
that control your eyelids.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.218
That's called
Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.596
It told us the tumor
was in the lungs.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.349
How bad is it?

15:36.853 --> 15:40.105
Small-cell is the most aggressive
kind of lung cancer.

15:40.898 --> 15:45.068
The five-year survival rate
is only about 10 to 15%.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.615
Which is why we have to start you
on chemo and radiation right away.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.450
Radiation?
What about the baby?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.910
You'll need a C-section
before you can start the treatment.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.954
I can get you in
first thing tomorrow morning.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.999
What are the chances
my baby will survive?

15:59.125 --> 16:03.045
Pretty good.
Twenty-eight weeks, so about 80%.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.549
No, wait.
That's one-in-five chance he'll die?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.968
I really wouldn't
advise waiting.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.929
Naomi, you gotta start
this treatment right away.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.806
What happens if I wait?

16:16.017 --> 16:20.562
Well, 29 weeks,
the survival rate is closer to 90%.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.401
- I'm not doing the radiation.
- But you'll die if you...

16:26.527 --> 16:28.737
Listen. You know the chances.
They're nothing.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.031
But a few more weeks
will save the baby.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.158
Listen.
You're depressed right now

16:33.284 --> 16:35.619
and you're not thinking right,
so...

16:35.745 --> 16:38.246
Could you...
Tell her, please.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.790
This cancer moves quick.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.751
The median survival's
two to four months.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.674
If you postpone
even for a week...

16:53.179 --> 16:54.971
I'm sorry, honey.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.854
As most of you know,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.564
Gregory House recently
gave a speech about me.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.068
I'd like to
return the favor.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.570
- Sorry.
- Dr. Wilson.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.783
I was hoping you were
gonna miss this one.

17:15.993 --> 17:20.997
A man is the sum of his actions.
Here are a few of Dr. House's.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.085
He violated a DNR
and was charged with assault.

17:26.295 --> 17:30.132
He brought a termite
into the OR and spat on a surgeon.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.093
He accepted a Corvette
from a patient

17:33.219 --> 17:35.470
who was a known member
of the New Jersey Mafia.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.431
- Ed, look...
- Edward.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.392
Edward. You look
at anyone's career,

17:40.518 --> 17:41.518
you can find
things that are...

17:41.644 --> 17:43.270
These are the
last three months.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.481
He's personally had more complaints
filed against him

17:46.607 --> 17:49.109
than any department
in this hospital.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.654
Okay. He's screwed-up.
He's miserable.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.949
And he should probably reread
the ethics code, but it works for him.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.409
He's saved
hundreds of lives.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.745
He is a drug addict
who flaunts his addiction

17:59.871 --> 18:00.954
and refuses
to get treatment.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.750
He is a disgrace and
an embarrassment to this hospital.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.003
I'd go on, but it
gets kind of mean,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.339
so I'm gonna
keep this simple.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.842
House goes or I go.

18:13.968 --> 18:14.926
You shouldn't
personalize this.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.513
And by "I",
I mean my $100 million.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.478
How's that for personalizing?

18:26.731 --> 18:29.107
You gave us that
money for a reason.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.818
Are you really willing to throw it
all away because of one doctor?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.572
Gregory House
is a symbol of everything wrong

18:35.698 --> 18:37.365
with the health
care industry.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.951
Waste. Insubordination.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.120
Doctors preening
like they're kings

18:42.246 --> 18:44.790
and the hospital is their
own private fiefdom.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.335
Health care is a business.
I'm gonna run it like one.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.632
I hereby move to revoke
the tenure of Dr. Gregory House

18:53.758 --> 18:56.092
and terminate his employment
at this hospital, effective immediately.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.637
- Shouldn't we discuss this?
- We just did.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.014
- We need time...
- It is on the table. All in favor?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.590
Dr. Wilson.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.133
Opposed.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.637
The motion is defeated.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.974
Dr. Wilson, would you mind leaving
the room, please?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.726
- Excuse me?
- We're gonna take another vote.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.938
Well, first of all,
you can't void my vote

19:50.064 --> 19:51.982
by making me
stand in the hallway.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.401
And second,
you should check the bylaws.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.319
You need notice
and at least one business day

19:56.445 --> 19:57.863
before you can
reconsider any matter.

19:57.989 --> 20:02.033
We're voting on a different matter,
which you are conflicted out of.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.202
How can I be conflicted?

20:04.328 --> 20:07.163
This vote is whether
to dismiss Dr. James Wilson.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.744
Naomi is refusing
to have the C-section.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.829
Her odds aren't
good enough.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.958
They do suck.
Where's Wilson?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.293
Paged him twice.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.086
She does this,
she knows she's gonna die.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.713
She's saving her child.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.884
Cameron would point out
that people are capable of sacrifice.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.054
- Cameron isn't here.
- Perhaps proving her point.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.057
You think this woman
is making a rational decision?

21:07.183 --> 21:09.893
I think people can
overcome their baser drives.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.561
Pretty damn rarely.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.356
And not this time.
This is purely biological.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.523
In evolutionary terms,

21:15.650 --> 21:17.859
the needs of the
next generation are more important.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.861
You're saying she's
making the right call?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.655
Darwin is. I'm not.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.240
The next generation
is not my patient.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.911
We have to raise
the odds for Mommy.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.081
And where the hell is Wilson?
He's the oncologist.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.541
Good plan.
Cure cancer.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.961
I'm surprised no
one ever thought of that before.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.297
There he is.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.007
Dr. House.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.927
- You guys bust out?
- We made bail.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.971
They won't let us
in our baby's room.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.473
Weird. You think
they'd let you take her home

21:48.599 --> 21:49.891
while they figured
out if you tried to kill her.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.810
We're good parents.
We fed her whenever she was hungry.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.895
Big meals. We had no idea
that diet was so bad for her.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.064
The nutritionist said
it had everything she needed.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.942
Listen. The kid who stacks
the free-range grapefruit

21:59.068 --> 22:01.277
in your health food store
is not a nutritionist.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.321
But my uncle is.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.949
He went to college
and everything.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.002
Foreman, I need
a CT scan on...

22:17.128 --> 22:20.755
- Olive Kaplan.
- Seriously?

22:22.550 --> 22:24.009
Olive Kaplan.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.470
Look for abscesses
or occult infections. Yeah.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.140
Bye-bye.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.692
Listen. Vogler's all
about clinical trials.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.944
The hospital's
chock-full of them.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.405
There's gotta be something
for small-cell lung cancer.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.283
What are you doing?

22:49.452 --> 22:50.535
I got sacked.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.748
Did you make a pass at Cuddy?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.042
I told you.
She only has thighs for me.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.710
I voted to keep you.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.921
So he's getting rid
of every board member

23:02.048 --> 23:03.631
who votes to
keep me around.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.633
Yeah.
Every one of us.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.054
- Just you?
- Yep.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.639
But you're only
off the board, right?

23:11.766 --> 23:15.143
They couldn't have gotten
unanimous approval for you.

23:15.269 --> 23:21.566
Brown from oncology voted no.
So did Cuddy, Taylor and Peavey.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.569
So you're off the board.
Big deal.

23:24.695 --> 23:27.405
Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling.
You're still a doctor.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.449
Yeah. Getting dumped
looks great in Who's Who.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.368
Vogler gave me
the option of resigning.

23:33.120 --> 23:33.953
And I took it.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.624
- Big of him.
- I got no kids, my marriage sucks...

23:37.750 --> 23:39.751
I only had two things
that worked for me.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.920
This job and this
stupid screwed-up friendship,

23:42.046 --> 23:44.422
and neither mattered enough
to you to give one lousy speech.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.181
They matter.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.063
- If I could do it all again...
- You'd do the same thing.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.407
Well, you'll be
gone soon, too.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.959
Those clinical trials?

24:29.051 --> 24:30.927
I'll make some calls.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.474
Thanks.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.651
It's not cancer.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.654
- It's not gonna kill me?
- It's hemorrhoids.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.990
But all that blood,
I mean, that can't be right.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.950
Looks worse than it is.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.037
- Nice job of protecting me.
- Can this wait?

24:58.164 --> 25:01.207
His ass can wait.
You save my job by sacking Wilson?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.751
What did you think would happen
when you made that speech?

25:03.878 --> 25:06.880
That you would just pout for a little
while and we'd all forgive you?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.632
You don't spit on the man
that signs your paycheck.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.968
First Cameron,
then Wilson.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.345
You're next.
Pull your pants up.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.763
So it's
about the money.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.558
Of course it's about the money.
The money Vogler gave,

25:18.684 --> 25:21.477
he could have bought
a few jets, maybe a baseball team.

25:21.604 --> 25:25.148
Or just stuck it in Chase Manhattan
and collected interest.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.736
But he gave it to us
to buy equipment, to do research.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.157
You are a great doctor, House,
but you are not worth $100 million.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.663
We've sequenced
the DNA of the tumor cells.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.166
P53 gene mutation
at codon 55.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.376
- She's perfect for your trial.
- Hmm.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.004
She's pretty
far advanced.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.591
Well, you want easy cases,
you picked the wrong specialty.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.306
- Otherwise in good health?
- Excellent.

25:58.432 --> 26:01.059
- When can she start?
- Middle of next week.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.353
Cancer's already stage III.
It'd be a waste of time.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.938
She can start
in two days.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.233
She can't start in two days.
She's pregnant.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.653
She won't be in two days.
I've scheduled a C-section.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.112
She'd still have
to wait a month.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.614
You can't take
part in any trial

26:14.740 --> 26:17.242
for at least 30 days
after major surgery.

26:17.368 --> 26:20.036
Well, it's definitely
surgery, but major?

26:20.162 --> 26:21.496
It's not your call.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.540
Again, question
of interpretation.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.085
You're scamming
a doctor? Now?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.295
Come on. Vogler's looking
for any excuse to can you.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.297
Oh, I think he's
got a big bag of those already.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.967
These regulations aren't just here
to annoy you, okay?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.261
Doing this is dangerous
to the patient.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.888
Well, I'll be sure
and let her know that.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.473
Care to join me?

26:43.227 --> 26:48.481
Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent
the tumors from creating blood vessels.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.316
Without blood,
the tumor starves.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.778
- That sounds great.
- What about the baby?

26:53.904 --> 26:56.239
The treatment would
be fatal to the baby.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.409
I've scheduled a C-section
for this afternoon.

26:59.535 --> 27:00.994
No.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.370
It's in the trial
phase right now,

27:02.496 --> 27:05.873
but so far, complete remission
in more than 30% of subjects.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.001
I told Dr. Foreman
I didn't want a C-section.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.168
When your chances
of living

27:09.295 --> 27:11.129
were less than a third
of what they are now.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.133
Well, if the baby's
premature, then...

27:15.259 --> 27:18.553
Our Pediatrics Department has
the best neonatal ICU in the state.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.763
No. His lungs.
His brain. He's not ready.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.640
And he could be fine.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.851
You don't know what
it's like raising a sick child.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.688
Look, his odds
are much better than yours are.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.191
You have to let
them at least try this.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.986
- Talk to her.
- Okay.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.613
Leave the room.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.658
Okay.

27:49.877 --> 27:52.628
How long have you
been taking oxybutynin?

27:53.547 --> 27:55.548
Since I was about 20.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.427
Incontinence is pretty
uncommon in a woman of your age.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.180
It's even more bizarre
in a woman in her 20s.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.183
I guess I haven't had the best luck
when it comes to my health.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.144
Seems that way.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.021
You said to
your husband,

28:10.147 --> 28:13.816
"You don't know what it's like
raising a sick child."

28:13.942 --> 28:16.361
You didn't say, "You don't know
what it would be like."

28:19.782 --> 28:21.532
This is not your
first child, is it?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.411
And he doesn't know.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.043
I was 18.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.089
I got pregnant,
got married.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.801
I had the most beautiful
little girl. Grace.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.722
She had infantile
Alexander's disease.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.892
I'm sorry.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.103
Two years we
watched her die.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.604
My husband was...

28:51.730 --> 28:56.401
My first husband
was a great guy.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.945
But after that, I
couldn't even look at him

28:59.071 --> 29:04.117
without thinking of her.
I left him.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.828
I left my job.
I left everything.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.955
Very moving story.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.165
Explains why you're
being so selfish.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.126
I'm willing to die
to protect my husband.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.545
Because it's
what you want.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.963
Your husband
wants you to live.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.966
- Well, he doesn't understand...
- Who the hell does?

29:20.843 --> 29:22.969
Tragedies happen.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.804
If you think that
turning yourself into

29:24.930 --> 29:26.681
a disposable
incubator for a few weeks

29:26.807 --> 29:29.475
is gonna protect your baby from all
the crap in this world, go ahead.

29:29.601 --> 29:33.020
Die happy. I got no problem
with people killing themselves.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.897
But don't think it
makes you a hero.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.286
Okay.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.667
You're scheduled
for 4:00 p.m.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.177
Yes. This is Dr. Lim.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.769
Count down from 10.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.146
Okay.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.608
Ten,

30:18.734 --> 30:21.152
nine,

30:21.278 --> 30:22.528
eight...

30:25.449 --> 30:28.034
- Tray setup.
- That seemed fast. Is she all right?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.619
She's fine.

30:32.789 --> 30:36.042
Wake her up.
That was Vogler. Surgery is off.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.013
Hey! You're killing her!

30:49.890 --> 30:52.767
Really? See, I thought
you were the one trying to ram her

30:52.893 --> 30:54.018
into a drug trial five
minutes after surgery.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.229
She knows the risk.
She was fully informed.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.064
Well, the guy running
the study sure wasn't.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.232
Not his life.
Not his call.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.691
His study, his call.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.610
Right. So she kicks off,
his numbers look bad.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.862
The numbers look bad,
the study looks bad.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.030
Which would
cost you money!

31:06.156 --> 31:08.950
Yeah, and keep a lifesaving protocol
off the market.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.868
One person!
One blip in the data!

31:10.994 --> 31:13.496
You ever heard of the FDA?
They eat blips for breakfast.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.206
One person should never
endanger thousands.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.626
Well, thank God you were here
to save all those lives!

31:25.801 --> 31:27.635
The board's meeting
again this evening.

31:28.095 --> 31:30.763
Why don't you settle down,
play some Game Boy?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.932
Why don't you
watch your soap?

31:33.058 --> 31:35.351
I hear they're firing
the handsome doctor today.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.270
Boy, that should
be a good one.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.617
If we had the
C-section anyway,

31:51.743 --> 31:54.036
she could still do
the experimental treatment, right?

31:54.162 --> 31:55.913
We'd just have
to wait 30 days.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.623
Assuming the doctor
running the trial

31:57.749 --> 31:58.916
isn't too pissed off
to let her in, yeah.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.086
And assuming I'm even
healthy enough to...

32:03.672 --> 32:05.840
Honey. Are you okay?

32:05.966 --> 32:08.634
Sats are dropping
down to the 80s. Stay with us, Naomi.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.886
- What's going on?
- We need you to leave the room.

32:13.515 --> 32:14.682
Respiratory distress.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.183
Could you just tell
me what's going on?

32:16.310 --> 32:17.435
We're trying
to find out.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.566
- Here.
- Still kicking.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.526
Flash pulmonary edema?

32:26.028 --> 32:28.362
Lungs are clear.
Here it is.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.072
- Pulmonary embolus.
- Gotta get her to an OR.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.616
Now. Right away.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.117
What happened?

32:33.243 --> 32:34.410
It's an embolism,
a blood clot.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.661
It's fairly common
with lung cancer.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.664
It's not a full saddle embolism,
so blood's still trickling through.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.374
We've been able to
get Naomi breathing a little,

32:40.500 --> 32:41.626
but we need to
remove the clot,

32:41.752 --> 32:42.918
and we need you
to approve the treatment.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.170
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.630
Whatever you have
to do, just do it.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.548
It's not that
simple, okay?

32:47.674 --> 32:50.009
The best course for the baby
would be an immediate C-section.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.344
The longer we postpone,
the greater chance

32:51.470 --> 32:52.637
he'll have brain damage
from lack of oxygen.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.639
Fine. Whatever.
Just do it.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.682
Here's the problem.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.478
The C-section would be
very, very dangerous for Naomi.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.188
Dangerous like...

33:03.065 --> 33:06.400
In her current condition, there's
a real chance she won't survive.

33:08.362 --> 33:09.945
I'm sorry.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.156
Now, look, your
wife's unconscious.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.866
We need you to
make a decision.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.122
I just want her to live.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.084
No C-section.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.100
Sats are still way down.
We gotta push the streptokinase.

33:39.226 --> 33:42.144
Too risky. Even if it dissolves
the clot, she could still bleed out.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.938
She's hemodynamically
compromised.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.482
- It's not good for the baby.
- Dad doesn't care.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.530
Bolusing 250,000 units.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.867
BP's dropping.
Pressors.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.577
We don't have time.
We've gotta suck it out.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.997
Systolic BP's 80.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.129
BP's stabilizing.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.465
O2 sats rising.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.178
Did you get the clot?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.973
I think so.
She's stabilized.

34:19.099 --> 34:20.683
How long was her
oxygen at that level?

34:20.809 --> 34:23.060
- About 10 minutes.
- Brain function compromised?

34:23.186 --> 34:25.146
Shouldn't be,
but we'll...

34:26.440 --> 34:28.858
BP's dropping.
Up the dopamine.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.193
She's not responding.
How much?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.319
She's up to
30 micrograms.

34:32.446 --> 34:33.320
Is she septic?

34:35.365 --> 34:36.824
She's bleeding
into her abdomen.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.035
We won't be
able to stop it.

34:43.874 --> 34:44.874
I'll go talk
to the husband.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.917
No. You stay here.
Keep her as stable as you can

34:47.043 --> 34:49.170
for as long
as you can.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.640
She had trauma
during the procedure.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.478
She's bleeding
into her abdomen.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.647
There's nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.067
No, no. No.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.819
I need you to
okay the C-section.

35:13.945 --> 35:18.115
- That's gonna kill her, right?
- Probably will.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.325
I can't do that.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.704
She's dying
either way.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.831
- I'm sorry.
- Stay with me, Sean.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.917
I need your
okay on this.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.003
She makes the decisions,
and I'm...

35:31.129 --> 35:34.632
Right. And that's gonna be tough from
now on, but this decision is easy.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.260
- You know what she'd want.
- Yeah.

35:39.596 --> 35:40.638
I can't do...

35:40.889 --> 35:43.140
You make this call,
only two things change.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.310
One, yeah, you feel
guilty for killing your wife.

35:46.436 --> 35:48.395
Two, your baby lives.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.274
Naomi's baby lives.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.115
Okay. Okay.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.252
Clamp.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.254
He's out.
Umbilical cord's clamped.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.380
No respiration.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.048
His lungs
aren't opening up.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.133
They aren't mature.

36:18.552 --> 36:21.053
Come on. Take a breath.
You know you can do it.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.850
- What you got?
- Looks like V-fib.

36:25.976 --> 36:29.186
- Pulse?
- No. Paddles.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.187
Right here.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.231
Come on. Come on.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.984
Clear!

36:36.236 --> 36:37.736
- Nothing.
- Charging.

36:37.863 --> 36:41.282
- Good boy. Open up.
- How's he doing?

36:41.408 --> 36:43.242
Still not breathing.
We've gotta intubate.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.411
Clear!

37:22.824 --> 37:24.658
Thank you.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.077
- I'm late for the board meeting.
- We need to talk.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.038
- I don't want to hear it.
- It's about a patient.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.582
The pregnant woman?
She wasn't qualified for that trial.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.251
- And I'm not gonna apologize...
- I'm not talking about her.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.003
At this point,
I think it's best if I concentrate

37:36.129 --> 37:38.464
on patients who
are still alive.

37:39.507 --> 37:43.135
Pulmonary embolism.
She bled out and saved her son.

37:45.597 --> 37:50.351
This is Olive Kaplan's CT scan,
the incredible shrinking baby.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.065
Her thymus gland.

37:56.191 --> 38:00.152
DiGeorge syndrome. It's genetic.
Caused the gland to wither to nothing.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.905
- This is why she couldn't gain weight.
- Yeah.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.741
I'll call the police
and Social Services

38:05.867 --> 38:07.743
and have all the charges
withdrawn.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.161
I've sent a test
down to confirm.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.913
When it comes back,
you should start Olive

38:11.039 --> 38:13.040
on immunoglobulin
replacement.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.042
You're not
gonna do it?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.837
Well, I assume
I won't be here.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.487
Your boy is doing good.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.136
It's the same motion
as yesterday, people.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.762
Same reasons.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.267
All those in favor of dismissing
Gregory House, raise a hand.

39:20.775 --> 39:25.904
Dr. Cuddy, you realize this
is going to happen.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.786
- I can't do it.
- You can't abstain.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.457
I'm not abstaining.
I'm voting no.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.461
You've changed your
mind since yesterday?

39:40.587 --> 39:42.504
What did he do?
Buy you dinner and roses?

39:42.630 --> 39:45.382
- Threaten to drown your dog?
- He did his job.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.968
Right.
He saved another life.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.720
- Maybe.
- Good for him.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.138
It's great.
It's not the point.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.389
It's what we do.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.807
And you could do it
a lot better

39:53.933 --> 39:56.018
if you didn't have to
worry about some madman

39:56.144 --> 39:57.895
running around the hospital
accountable to no one.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.313
But that's not the choice
you're giving us.

39:59.439 --> 40:00.898
House won't
listen to anyone.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.650
And you're not accountable
to anybody either

40:03.777 --> 40:05.277
because you think
you own us.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.739
I move for the immediate dismissal
of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.616
She's upset. We all are.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.993
Why would you risk your career
to save him?

40:17.165 --> 40:19.124
If you think House
deserves to go,

40:19.250 --> 40:21.210
if you think
I deserve to go,

40:21.336 --> 40:24.671
Wilson deserved to go,
then vote yes.

40:25.590 --> 40:29.051
But if you're doing this because
you are afraid of losing his money,

40:29.177 --> 40:31.720
then he's right.
He does own you.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.063
You have a choice.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.940
Maybe the last real
one you'll have here.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.747
Cuddy is a genius.

40:59.082 --> 41:02.918
Convincing four people to give up
a fortune to save our sorry asses.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.171
Dr. Cuddy,
the man of the hour.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.840
Hey, hey!

41:07.966 --> 41:09.800
Hey.
What are you doing?

41:09.926 --> 41:12.177
We're drinking. I would have
thought that was pretty obvious.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.888
To the great champion.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.392
Saved you, saved Wilson,
saved the whole team.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.613
Of course, none of them
would have needed saving

41:31.739 --> 41:35.242
if you could actually
get along with another human being.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.994
Thank you,
Miss Buzzkill.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.873
Well, you only
cost us $100 million.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.667
Could have saved some lives,
could have made a few jobs,

41:43.793 --> 41:46.003
helped a few people, yippee.

41:46.129 --> 41:50.090
- You voted to get rid of him.
- The lesser of two evils.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.219
You should be mourning.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.971
I know I am.
