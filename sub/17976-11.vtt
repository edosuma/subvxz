UH, P-I-E--
I'M NOT ON THE LIST.

24:49.333 --> 24:50.800
THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND.

24:50.833 --> 24:51.800
YEAH,
WE'RE TOGETHER.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.533
YEAH, ALICE PIESZECKI

24:53.567 --> 24:55.267
OF THE CHART KCRW.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.367
OKAY, ANYWAY,
THIS IS MY BROTHER,

24:59.400 --> 25:00.933
AND I THOUGHT

25:00.967 --> 25:02.600
THEY COULD BE
ON THE FLOAT WITH ME.

25:02.633 --> 25:05.000
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY, DANA.

25:05.033 --> 25:06.367
ONLY THE PEOPLE
WHOSE NAMES ARE ON THIS LIST

25:06.400 --> 25:07.533
GET TO GO ON THE FLOAT.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.167
THEY CAN WATCH YOU
FROM THE CROWD.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.667
THAT'LL BE FUN
FOR THEM.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.867
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S THE HRC

25:12.900 --> 25:14.267
OR THE GLAAD FLOAT
OR ANYTHING, ANYWAY.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.833
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.

25:15.867 --> 25:17.067
ALICE.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.600
DANA, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO RIDE ON THE FLOAT,

25:18.633 --> 25:20.033
WE'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU...

25:20.067 --> 25:21.767
ALONE.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.067
SORRY, YOU GUYS.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.433
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER.

25:24.467 --> 25:25.533
YEAH.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.133
SORRY.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.633
SWEET OF HER.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.400
PEOPLE REALLY
LOVE HER, HUH?

25:36.433 --> 25:38.300
YEAH...

25:38.333 --> 25:39.700
ALL RIGHT, KEEP THEM MOVING.
HE'S STRAIGHT. COME ON.

25:39.733 --> 25:41.067
I'M SORRY.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.067
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A MEAT MARKET.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.067
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:43.100 --> 25:44.067
I'M GOOD, YEAH.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.300
AL, COME WITH ME.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.733
WHAT?

25:46.767 --> 25:48.000
SHE WON'T COME WITH ME,
SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

25:48.033 --> 25:49.400
BECAUSE SHANE
WANTS ME TO RIDE WITH HER

25:49.433 --> 25:51.400
WITH THE MOTORCYCLE LESBIANS.

25:51.433 --> 25:52.933
THE DYKES ON BIKES,
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING?

25:52.967 --> 25:54.433
NO, I WANT TO BE
AN OBSERVER.

25:54.467 --> 25:57.167
OH, I SO WANT TO GO,
YEAH, UM...

25:57.200 --> 25:58.200
HOWIE.
WHAT ABOUT HOWIE?

25:58.233 --> 25:59.300
YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

25:59.333 --> 26:00.600
I'LL LOOK AFTER HIM.

26:00.633 --> 26:01.700
YOU'RE GOOD? YOU'RE GOOD?

26:01.733 --> 26:02.967
I'M GOOD.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.700
HEY, I'M HOWIE.
OU.

26:04.733 --> 26:05.933
WANT TO WALK AROUND?

26:05.967 --> 26:07.500
YEAH, SURE.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.267
I'M GOING TO GO
WITH THE DYKES ON BIKES,

26:09.300 --> 26:13.300
SO, UH, YOU CAN WRITE THAT
ON YOUR CLIPBOARD.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.567
SEE YOU.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.867
UM, SHANE...

26:19.900 --> 26:20.967
WHAT?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.100
UM, I TOLD DANA I LOVED HER,

26:22.133 --> 26:22.967
TWICE.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.167
THAT'S GOOD.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.533
YEAH, BUT SHE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING BACK,

26:25.567 --> 26:28.767
AND, UM, THAT'S BAD, RIGHT?

26:30.933 --> 26:33.433
OKAY, WHY AM I EVEN
TALKING TO YOU

26:33.467 --> 26:34.700
ABOUT LOVE?

26:34.733 --> 26:36.100
SERIOUS.

26:36.133 --> 26:37.967
LOOK, AT LEAST I CAN SEE
SHE LOVES YOU.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.100
YOU CAN?

26:39.133 --> 26:40.200
YEAH. YOU CAN'T?

26:40.233 --> 26:42.233
COME ON.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.467
OH, MY GOD.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.100
SHANE!

27:52.267 --> 27:53.700
HI, DANA.
HI, DANA.

27:53.733 --> 27:54.867
I HAVE A SECRET.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.033
WHAT?

27:57.067 --> 27:58.333
I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY ATTENDED

27:58.367 --> 27:59.733
A PRIDE PARADE BEFORE.

27:59.767 --> 28:01.267
I MEAN, I'VE HAD
PARTIES AROUND IT,

28:01.300 --> 28:03.733
I'VE RENTED ROOFTOPS
WITH AMAZING VIEWS OF IT,

28:03.767 --> 28:06.700
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
BEEN IN IT.

28:06.733 --> 28:07.867
WELL, WELCOME.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.133
WE'RE HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU.

28:09.167 --> 28:10.433
THANK YOU...

28:10.467 --> 28:12.300
AND HOW ABOUT YOU?

28:12.333 --> 28:15.700
OH, THIS IS
MY SEVENTH.

28:15.733 --> 28:19.133
SUCH A POLITICAL BEING YOU ARE,

28:19.167 --> 28:20.067
FIGHTING
FOR GAY RIGHTS.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.333
NOT REALLY.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.400
BETTE AND I
USED TO COME EVERY YEAR.

28:23.433 --> 28:26.000
IT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE
TO HAVE A MARGARITA BEFORE 3:00.

28:27.667 --> 28:28.800
DO YOU MISS THAT?

28:30.533 --> 28:33.233
I LIKE BEING HERE WITH YOU,

28:33.267 --> 28:35.000
SEEING IT THROUGH
YOUR EYES.

28:37.433 --> 28:39.733
OH, SHE NEEDS
TO GET SPANKED.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.700
COME ON, EVERYBODY,
LET'S JUMP ON BOARD.

28:45.567 --> 28:46.533
JENNY...

28:46.567 --> 28:47.533
HEY.

28:47.567 --> 28:48.533
HI.

28:48.567 --> 28:49.767
HAVE YOU SEEN HOWIE?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.267
UM, HE SAID THAT HE'D
MEET UP WITH YOU LATER.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.933
WAS HE FREAKING?

28:52.967 --> 28:54.367
NO.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.067
DID HE SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

28:55.100 --> 28:56.767
MAYBE HE WENT

28:56.800 --> 28:57.933
TO A SPORTS BAR
OR SOMETHING.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.033
YEAH, PROBABLY.

28:59.067 --> 29:00.833
OH, MY GOD.

29:00.867 --> 29:02.533
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

29:02.567 --> 29:03.567
WHAT?

29:03.600 --> 29:04.733
HOWIE--

29:04.767 --> 29:06.267
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.733
MAYBE THERE'S
A GOOD GAME ON.

29:10.767 --> 29:11.933
WILL I SEE YOU THERE?

29:13.533 --> 29:14.633
MAYBE.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.367
WELL...

29:16.400 --> 29:18.767
I LOVE TO PUNISH A TEASE.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.600
[QUIETLY]:
I WISH YOU WERE HERE, MOM.

30:08.633 --> 30:10.033
[DOOR OPENS]

30:10.067 --> 30:11.333
HEY...

30:14.267 --> 30:17.067
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

30:18.567 --> 30:19.600
HOW IS HE?

30:19.633 --> 30:22.433
THE SAME.

30:22.467 --> 30:24.133
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?

30:24.167 --> 30:25.500
IF I GO HOME,

30:25.533 --> 30:27.767
ALL I'M GOING TO DO
IS THINK ABOUT BEING HERE.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.433
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST STAY HERE--

30:30.467 --> 30:31.567
I CAN.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.967
IT'S MY DECISION.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.167
IS THAT MY KATIE?

30:36.200 --> 30:40.300
YEAH, DADDY.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.600
COME HERE.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.100
I BROUGHT YOUR PAJAMAS.

30:46.800 --> 30:50.333
OH, KATIE, I'M SO SORRY.

30:52.967 --> 30:54.833
ALL THESE YEARS...

30:57.700 --> 30:59.500
SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

30:59.533 --> 31:01.367
OH, KATIE...

31:01.400 --> 31:04.000
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.567
IS MY BABY HERE?

31:11.600 --> 31:15.333
YEAH, SHE'S HERE.

31:31.100 --> 31:34.067
I...

31:34.100 --> 31:36.633
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

31:38.533 --> 31:41.500
WE LOVE YOU TOO, DADDY.

31:48.267 --> 31:49.400
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

31:49.433 --> 31:51.167
OH, GOD, SURE YOU CAN.
COME ON.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.500
OKAY, MAYBE IT'S
NOT A GREAT IDEA.

31:55.533 --> 31:56.900
ALL RIGHT,

31:56.933 --> 31:58.233
LET'S JUST LOOK
AT THE PROS AND CONS.

31:58.267 --> 32:00.367
OKAY, UM...

32:00.400 --> 32:02.067
OKAY, OKAY.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.100
"GENTLE WITH NOVICES."

32:03.133 --> 32:04.100
THIS IS GOOD.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.167
OKAY, GREAT,

32:05.200 --> 32:07.500
SO WE CAN JUST TELL THEM
IT'S OUR FIRST TIME.

32:07.533 --> 32:09.633
I THINK THEY MIGHT
KNOW THAT, DANA.

32:09.667 --> 32:11.267
OKAY.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.900
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S SEVEN
STATIONS OF THE CROSS.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.033
OKAY.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.067
UH, LET'S SEE,
WHIPPING,

32:16.100 --> 32:17.233
TEMPORARY PIERCING...

32:17.267 --> 32:19.400
PUBLIC HUMILIATION,
ANAL PENETRATION,

32:19.433 --> 32:20.500
TORCHING?

32:20.533 --> 32:22.167
TORCHING? OY.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.500
OKAY, SPANKING,
AND SPECIALTY ARTS.

32:24.533 --> 32:25.633
THAT'S NICE.

32:25.667 --> 32:26.800
MM-HMM.

32:26.833 --> 32:27.933
OH, THERE'S
A FREE BUFFET

32:27.967 --> 32:29.033

32:29.067 --> 32:31.000
CHICKEN WINGS AND TOFU.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.500
I DON'T KNOW.

32:34.533 --> 32:36.233
WE'LL SNEAK A PEEK,
AND...

32:36.267 --> 32:37.367
YEAH.
GREAT.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.633
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

32:38.667 --> 32:40.000
OKAY.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.533
HEY.

32:45.767 --> 32:46.800
HI.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.133
OH, SO POLITE.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.600
OOH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
YOUR SAFE WORD TO BE?

32:49.633 --> 32:50.733
I DON'T KNOW. "TUNAFISH?"

32:50.767 --> 32:52.100
THANK YOU.

32:57.067 --> 32:58.633
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.233
GREAT. PLANET?

33:00.267 --> 33:01.533
UH, GREAT. YEAH.

33:01.567 --> 33:04.433
FANTASTIC.

33:04.467 --> 33:05.367
OKAY.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.433
BYE.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.967
THANK YOU.
THANKS.

33:11.633 --> 33:13.667
[***]

33:30.700 --> 33:31.867
HEY, HEY, HEY.
HAPPY PRIDE.

33:31.900 --> 33:34.533
OH, MY GOD,
YOU ARE HUGE.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.033
OH, MY GOD.

33:43.067 --> 33:44.867
YOU ARE
SO PREGNANT.

33:44.900 --> 33:46.200
WOW. HI.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.333
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

33:47.367 --> 33:48.933
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:13.333 --> 34:14.300
HI.

34:14.333 --> 34:15.333
HI.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.467
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

34:17.500 --> 34:20.500
I'M CELEBRATING GAY PRIDE,
I GUESS.

34:20.533 --> 34:21.867
I DON'T KNOW.

34:21.900 --> 34:25.367
YOU MEAN GAY SHAME.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.567
THAT'S WHAT
IT REALLY IS.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.967
WHY?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.200
BECAUSE...

34:32.233 --> 34:33.300
MOST OF US

34:33.333 --> 34:36.600
HAVE MORE SHAME
THAN PRIDE.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.633
I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.633
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

34:48.933 --> 34:50.533
NO.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.167
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

34:52.200 --> 34:56.567
AM I TOO OLD OR TOO SUBURBAN
OR SOMETHING?

34:58.633 --> 35:00.767
NO.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.433
YOU'RE PERFECT.

35:05.733 --> 35:08.133
DO YOU WANT TO KISS ME?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.767
HAPPY PRIDE.

35:33.467 --> 35:34.933
WHY DON'T, UM...

35:34.967 --> 35:36.033
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE...

35:36.067 --> 35:38.033
LEIGH?

35:39.633 --> 35:40.600
HEY.

35:40.633 --> 35:41.933
HOW ARE YOU?

35:41.967 --> 35:42.933
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

35:42.967 --> 35:43.833
SO YOU MADE IT.

35:43.867 --> 35:45.000
YEAH,
IT'S A GREAT PARTY.

35:45.033 --> 35:45.967
DID YOU ENJOY
THE PARADE?

35:46.000 --> 35:46.967
OH, YEAH,
I HAD A GREAT TIME.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.567
TINA, THIS IS LEIGH.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.033
LEIGH, THIS IS
MY FRIEND TINA.

35:50.067 --> 35:51.033
HI.

35:51.067 --> 35:52.100
VERY PREGNANT FRIEND.

35:52.133 --> 35:54.967
SHE AND HER EX
ARE HAVING A BABY.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.800
OH, I'M SORRY.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.067
UH, NOT ABOUT THE BABY,
ABOUT THE EX.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.667
I'M JUST GOING THROUGH
A BREAKUP MYSELF.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.667
OH, YOU KNOW,
I HEARD,

36:01.700 --> 36:03.067
BUT I WASN'T SURE
ABOUT THAT.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.700
WELL, THE RUMORS
ARE TRUE.

36:04.733 --> 36:05.967
VALERIE MOVED
BACK TO NEW YORK,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.233
AND WE JUST
WEREN'T READY

36:07.267 --> 36:08.867
FOR A LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP, SO...

36:08.900 --> 36:10.700
OH, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S WISE.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.467
SO...

36:12.500 --> 36:14.100
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

36:14.133 --> 36:15.667
UM...

36:15.700 --> 36:16.767
OH, DANCE.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.933
PLEASE DO.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.500
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

36:19.533 --> 36:20.667
OKAY.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.533
GREAT. OKAY, OKAY.

36:22.567 --> 36:24.167
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.233
HEY!

36:38.267 --> 36:38.933
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:38.967 --> 36:40.233
WE JUST GOT HERE.

36:40.267 --> 36:41.767
IT'S HOT IN HERE.
I NEED TO STEP OUT.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.000
OKAY.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.267
HURRY BACK,
THOUGH, OKAY?

36:44.300 --> 36:46.700
OKAY.
