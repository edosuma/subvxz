00:31.898 --> 00:34.067
-He's handsome.
-Maintain your composure.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.314
Yes, sir!

04:53.026 --> 04:55.395
I started dancing when I was eight.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.097
As well as dancing,
I have studied circus acrobatics.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.366
I practice aerial silk and aerial hoop.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.302
My other passion is cooking.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.839
I have a cooking channel
called Hot Chef...

05:08.141 --> 05:09.309
Hey! How's it going?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.678
...where I cook naked.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.247
Well, almost naked.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.517
It's my first time ever in a competition.

05:17.583 --> 05:22.121
I have never been
in any physical competitions before.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.990
It's my first time. I'm really happy.

05:26.092 --> 05:29.295
-Great, Pedro! Fantastic!
-Keep it simple. Very good!

06:25.918 --> 06:29.122
-He's worrying me.
-Same here. He's scaring me.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.225
-He's having trouble breathing.
-Did he draw breath?

06:45.471 --> 06:46.806
Yes!

06:47.206 --> 06:50.042
-He's finding it difficult, but...
-What a champ!

06:55.515 --> 06:57.116
Come on, man!

06:57.550 --> 06:59.919
He's an acrobat,
so he should nail this one.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.255
-Come on!
-Grab hold of the trapeze!

07:02.321 --> 07:05.191
-Good! He managed to grab it!
-He did it perfectly.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.896
-No!
-Well, he tried. He tried.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.765
Very brave. Yes, sir. He made it far.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.205
I feel okay.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.907
But I hit my chest...

07:21.674 --> 07:22.742
very hard.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.412
I ran out of strength,
and I ran out of air.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.916
Who will win? India!

07:35.888 --> 07:37.690
That's some intense breathing.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.628
Physics is very close to my heart.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.164
It's a very ambitious discipline

07:45.231 --> 07:49.035
because it attempts
to explain the whole universe.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.071
Parkour involves simple physics.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.674
I think,
because of my background in physics,

07:54.740 --> 07:56.843
I was able to learn parkour quite easily.

07:57.210 --> 08:01.581
Parkour movements can be easily analyzed
when you have a background in science.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.053
-He has a good technique.
-Come on!

08:07.119 --> 08:10.656
-This is just what I expected from Cyrus.
-Wow.

08:44.023 --> 08:49.195
He's our little panther. And look at
how beautifully he's moving forward.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.588
Well done, John!

12:35.654 --> 12:37.389
He is good! Well done, John!

13:11.690 --> 13:14.326
Well, now that
I've met the Beast in person,

13:14.393 --> 13:19.665
I can't wait to go straight into its jaws
and tear it apart from the inside out.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.140
-Don't fall. Don't fall! Come on.
-We're with you, Andrea.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.441
You can do it!

13:29.508 --> 13:30.376
Yes! No!

13:31.577 --> 13:33.212
-No!
-No!

13:34.246 --> 13:35.648
She fell headfirst.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.592
I'm ready to win, ready to beat the Beast.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.894
Let's go!

13:48.961 --> 13:52.398
That's apparently what
French firemen say. He told us earlier.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.300
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

13:55.234 --> 13:56.936
-No!
-Oh, no!

13:57.002 --> 13:59.271
No, no!

14:28.734 --> 14:32.404
If he succeeds, he'll invite
the Chinese audience to his restaurant.

14:38.244 --> 14:43.082
He's miming eating noodles.
Are they plain noodles or spinach noodles?

14:49.955 --> 14:52.057
He slid down, just like a noodle.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.526
Come to China and eat noodles!

14:59.064 --> 15:02.301
Lorenzo, I'll make you pasta Carbonara

15:02.368 --> 15:03.969
if you reach the end!

15:04.036 --> 15:05.671
Stop it! Let him focus!

15:09.608 --> 15:12.544
-You can make it.
-He's a climber!

15:12.611 --> 15:17.917
-Don't worry. Relax, man. Relax.
-Climbing a rope is no challenge for him!

15:21.453 --> 15:23.289
The French are haters!

15:29.395 --> 15:31.864
Don't listen to them.
No, you'll distract him!

15:31.931 --> 15:35.100
Please, France, do not distract us!
Thank you!

15:36.502 --> 15:38.671
Okay, let's move forward!

15:47.646 --> 15:51.550
I think he felt a bit rushed and...

15:51.617 --> 15:53.652
He just didn't make it. Oh, well!

15:54.687 --> 15:55.821
Never mind!

15:55.888 --> 15:59.291
I'm very proud of Lorenzo.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.316
Go, Claire!

16:29.855 --> 16:32.191
She's been practicing parkour
for eight years.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.293
This should go really well for her.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.435
She's reached the Grinder.
That's five more points.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.571
-Take your time. Come on, girl.
-Go, go.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.072
Slowly but surely...

17:12.498 --> 17:15.968
-Wow! Come on!
-Excellent! Well done! You're awesome!

17:28.881 --> 17:32.985
-No!
-No! Oh, dear. Claire! You poor thing!

17:38.957 --> 17:42.428
I was a bit scared when I jumped,
which unsettled me slightly.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.396
I'm out of energy.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.579
I didn't bring a change of clothes.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.614
I don't want to fall in the water.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.920
I discovered parkour six years ago.

18:07.986 --> 18:11.757
Back then, I didn't go out a lot.
I didn't know many people.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.693
Then I saw these kids jumping on walls.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.429
They told me
it was a sport called parkour.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.732
So I started training with them.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.902
I got really into the sport...

18:24.336 --> 18:25.537
and I found a new family.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.941
This is my moment.
I have to win, no matter what.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.012
Remi could be eliminated.

18:34.079 --> 18:38.584
If he gets to the Energy Coils,
Remi's out of here.

18:38.650 --> 18:39.518
That will be it.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.857
Come on. Let go. No!

18:44.923 --> 18:46.191
Oh, Remi's out.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.366
-Very good!
-The French are haters!

18:55.767 --> 18:58.937
-We're not looking at you, Francesco.
-They're so mean.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.772
The Italians are mean.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.714
Great, Cippa!
You'll make it to the second level!

19:08.780 --> 19:09.848
Very good!

19:16.421 --> 19:18.423
Let's show our support for Cippa!

19:18.824 --> 19:20.792
-Cippa!
-Careful, Francesco.

19:20.859 --> 19:21.793
Cippa!

19:55.460 --> 19:56.695
-Yes!
-Well done!

19:56.762 --> 19:58.263
Come on, Cippa!

19:58.330 --> 20:00.098
Great, Cippa!

20:12.611 --> 20:13.645
Come on, Cippa!

20:13.712 --> 20:14.580
Hold on!

20:14.646 --> 20:15.948
God!

20:16.748 --> 20:19.451
All the other Italian contestants
are rooting for him!

20:19.518 --> 20:20.686
They should be!

20:25.023 --> 20:27.025
Come on, Alberto!

20:32.464 --> 20:33.365
Italy!

20:41.139 --> 20:43.242
-Hi, Mom! "LOL!"
-Oh, Mom!

20:43.308 --> 20:45.777
-"LOL!" With two L's!
-She's the best!

20:45.844 --> 20:47.613
-What's her name?
-Antonella.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.797
Let's go and jinx them!

21:05.864 --> 21:08.100
Let's go to the French booth

21:08.166 --> 21:09.635
and jinx them.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.283
He's standing on the Energy Coils.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.353
Go, go!

21:28.420 --> 21:30.122
Go, go!

21:30.188 --> 21:32.891
If he makes this one,
France is eliminated.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.235
Bye!

21:43.302 --> 21:45.604
-See you later.
-See you later!

21:54.146 --> 21:56.081
-Oh, gosh!
-Oh, gosh!

22:32.184 --> 22:34.886
The Italians are still celebrating
our defeat.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.859
The Italians aren't nice, right?

23:05.517 --> 23:09.287
The contestant I want to defeat the most
is Alberto from Italy.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.656
He's an excellent contestant

23:11.723 --> 23:15.994
but our scores are really close,
so I want to...

23:16.428 --> 23:18.130
I need to beat John.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.132
That's my goal.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.033
He has very strong arms,

23:22.100 --> 23:25.203
and I absolutely need to get
a higher score than his.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.948
-Oh, goodness!
-Oh, goodness!

26:23.014 --> 26:24.616
Oh, goodness. He did it.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.099
Jiebin!

27:09.127 --> 27:12.697
He managed to get the Points Thruster,
but his shoes are wet now.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.233
This may affect his performance.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.635
But I hope not.

27:28.413 --> 27:32.283
The Stomach Churn is a curse
to a lot of contestants,

27:33.151 --> 27:38.323
because the fast-spinning platforms
make them dizzy.

27:44.295 --> 27:47.465
The second platform is the hardest
because it spins the fastest.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.706
Wow!

27:55.774 --> 27:57.509
The platform was so slippery.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.545
The first platform was really slippery.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.647
After I went up...

28:04.049 --> 28:04.916
it spun too fast.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.547
This descending part, the spine,

28:35.613 --> 28:37.482
is a bit tricky.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.484
You have to hang on tight.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.222
-Well done, Cippa!
-Very good!

29:18.757 --> 29:20.458
Come on! From here, it's all jumps!

29:21.092 --> 29:24.129
-Is he still on his chair? He is.
-Still on his chair.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.599
I'm scared Francesco will fall.
Maybe Alberto's about to fall...

29:27.899 --> 29:29.901
He has to make it!

29:29.968 --> 29:32.237
On this occasion,

29:32.303 --> 29:34.572
I'm taking out my magic wand.

29:34.639 --> 29:38.977
Beware! The fairy Bianca Balti is here!

29:39.043 --> 29:40.612
Bianca Balti, the fairy!

29:40.678 --> 29:41.846
Here, a kiss!

29:41.913 --> 29:46.818
Oh, fairy Bianca Balti,
please, work your magic!

29:47.752 --> 29:48.686
Bravo!

30:04.302 --> 30:08.273
-Wow!
-Come on, Alberto! Fly!

30:23.388 --> 30:24.823
-Bravo!
-Well done, Alberto!

30:36.301 --> 30:37.502
Work your magic!

30:37.569 --> 30:41.172
Bianca, work your magic!

35:18.416 --> 35:21.119
I think I started cycling
when I was three years old.

35:21.185 --> 35:23.354
I joined competitions
all over the country.

35:23.654 --> 35:27.191
I try the local delicacies wherever I go.

35:27.258 --> 35:28.693
I eat noodles the most,

35:29.060 --> 35:31.662
so I opened a noodle restaurant.

35:32.196 --> 35:36.033
When you eat my noodles, you'll feel
like you're eating home-cooked food.

35:36.100 --> 35:40.705
Whether I'm cycling or managing
my restaurant, I will persevere,

35:40.771 --> 35:42.907
and I'll succeed eventually.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.164
-Great! Not bad.
-Yes!

36:34.692 --> 36:35.726
-Shuai Tian...
-Yes.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.403
Yeah, sure.

37:04.522 --> 37:05.356
Come down.

37:05.423 --> 37:08.626
-Save your energy for the next round.
-It's time to eat noodles.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.395
Pull yourself up!

38:17.461 --> 38:20.598
Use your elbows.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.423
-Come on, Lorenzo!
-Come on!

38:48.826 --> 38:53.097
-Where have they gone?
-Where have the Italians gone?

38:53.164 --> 38:56.033
-Where have they gone?
-Where have they gone?

38:56.100 --> 38:59.437
-Where have the Italians gone?
-Where have the Italians gone? Ciao!

39:33.938 --> 39:35.706
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro!

39:35.773 --> 39:38.843
Hello! It's Andrea.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.144
Come on!

39:40.444 --> 39:42.246
Let's all cheer for Pedro!

40:05.002 --> 40:06.670
That's too bad.

40:09.206 --> 40:11.809
Up! Up! Come on! Kick! Yes!

41:29.186 --> 41:30.721
Here comes the fighting bull.

42:04.555 --> 42:06.657
-He's limping, right?
-He's limping.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.893
-Is it his back?
-It's his leg, his leg.

42:08.959 --> 42:12.763
-It's not his back?
-Maybe the left leg. It's bothering him.

42:54.672 --> 42:56.273
He gave up.

43:13.524 --> 43:14.925
Tell them I hit my hip.

43:17.928 --> 43:19.763
And I felt something crack.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.469
-Is it broken?
-I've never broken anything.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.919
Let's hope he falls!

44:30.167 --> 44:32.670
I feel really bad for Lorenzo.

44:52.556 --> 44:56.527
Of all of our competitors, Sarah,
I'm most impressed by him.

44:56.593 --> 44:58.896
His parkour ability is just brilliant.

45:00.164 --> 45:01.665
-That's how you jump.
-Lovely.

45:01.732 --> 45:03.667
That's exactly how you should leap.

45:27.624 --> 45:29.860
-Yes! Yes!
-I love you, buddy. I love you!

45:49.513 --> 45:52.616
I have to say, Sarah,
he didn't lose courage until the very end.

45:52.683 --> 45:55.652
-Absolutely.
-He tried his very best.

46:59.483 --> 47:03.220
I'm 30 points away from John,
who is in first place,

47:03.287 --> 47:06.223
and 25 points away from Alberto,
in second place.

47:06.290 --> 47:08.892
The two of them are my competition
for this series.

47:27.344 --> 47:30.180
Cyrus, I swear by the samosa,
make us proud...

47:48.632 --> 47:51.568
-He's a physics student...
-So he should perform very well.

47:51.635 --> 47:53.070
Exactly. I was gonna say that.

48:22.666 --> 48:25.302
Oh. His height is a bit
of a disadvantage, Sarah.

49:10.113 --> 49:11.615
So, Chris!

49:12.549 --> 49:16.053
Tell us something about this athlete.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.655
Come on, Chris. Tell us something.

49:21.892 --> 49:24.161
Alberto set off!

49:24.227 --> 49:25.929
Let's see how he does!

49:25.996 --> 49:27.998
He grabbed it!

49:28.065 --> 49:29.866
Go! Go! Take the Point Thruster!

49:37.641 --> 49:39.710
Unbelievable!

49:39.776 --> 49:42.646
What a turn of events! Oh, no!

50:09.106 --> 50:10.774
After the Point Thruster,

50:10.841 --> 50:11.942
I turned around

50:12.009 --> 50:15.612
and I couldn't reach the next one.

50:16.513 --> 50:17.948
I'm pretty disappointed.

50:41.972 --> 50:43.940
His signature move is to eat noodles.

50:59.189 --> 51:00.223
He's so strong.

51:00.824 --> 51:02.893
-The restaurant owner...
-You can do it.

51:02.959 --> 51:05.529
...is moving through
the noodle-like metal tubes.

51:34.024 --> 51:36.326
He's getting nearer to his noodles.

51:37.194 --> 51:38.829
The noodles are slightly greasy.

51:59.349 --> 52:01.384
Italy!

52:01.952 --> 52:02.986
I'm rejecting him.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.890
Hey, show good sportsmanship.

55:30.293 --> 55:33.263
I have to give it everything
if I want to win.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.633
This is going to be my breakthrough.
I'll be at my best.

55:37.067 --> 55:38.802
John, beware!

55:38.868 --> 55:40.704
I think it's time for me to take over.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.036
We're 45 points behind. It won't be easy.

56:13.103 --> 56:15.338
He should get all the Point Thrusters.

56:15.405 --> 56:17.340
If Cippa wins,

56:17.407 --> 56:19.876
Bianca will kiss him on the lips.

56:19.943 --> 56:21.277
She promised.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.446
So, Cippa, give it your all!

56:23.513 --> 56:24.581
Yeah, look at him!

56:24.647 --> 56:26.716
He's so motivated!

57:23.006 --> 57:24.474
Cippa, did you hear me?

57:24.541 --> 57:27.677
If you win, Bianca Balti will kiss you!

57:44.928 --> 57:46.963
Cippa, hurry up!

57:47.030 --> 57:50.266
You can still make it,
but you have to reach the fan.

58:23.967 --> 58:26.536
Use the magic wand! Go on!

58:26.603 --> 58:28.705
Fall! Fall!

58:29.205 --> 58:30.273
Fall!

58:30.340 --> 58:32.041
I want you to fall!

58:46.556 --> 58:49.459
-Come on!
-Go on, Cippa!

58:49.526 --> 58:50.793
Come on, Cippa!

58:51.305 --> 58:57.941
