00:35.493 --> 00:38.329
<i>Peace is an illusion.</i>

00:39.497 --> 00:42.000
<i>And no matter how tranquil </i>
<i>the world seems...</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:44.919
<i>peace doesn't last long. </i>

00:56.014 --> 00:59.434
<i>Peace is a struggle </i>
<i>against our very nature.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:06.608
<i>A skin we stretch over the bone,</i>
<i>muscle, and sinew</i>

01:06.691 --> 01:09.319
<i>of our own innate savagery.</i>

01:16.826 --> 01:17.911
What are you doing?

01:18.369 --> 01:19.996
We can't just leave her here.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.957
She's not our problem.
You want to get us arrested?

01:23.666 --> 01:24.626
Just...

01:26.294 --> 01:27.337
let her go.

01:33.009 --> 01:37.847
<i>The instinct of violence</i>
<i>curls inside us like a parasite,</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:43.144
<i>waiting for a chance to feed on our rage </i>
<i>and multiply until it bursts out of us.</i>

01:46.731 --> 01:48.691
<i>War is the only thing</i>
<i>we really understand.</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:03.915
Long live the Uprising!

02:04.541 --> 02:07.877
Long live Quellcrist Falconer...

02:09.212 --> 02:10.839
<i>Long live Quellcrist Falconer!</i>

02:29.649 --> 02:30.483
Christ.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.490
Ah, for fuck's sake.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.870
No hookers. Just get out of my room.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.874
-I'd love to, but I have a job to do.
-You can keep what he paid you.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.668
How generous of you.
But then it's not your money, is it?

02:48.751 --> 02:52.881
This is not a siren of the night.
Ms. Prescott is an attorney.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.049
Your hotel seems more perceptive than you.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.593
That's disappointing,

02:56.676 --> 02:59.554
in view of the trouble and expense
Mr. Bancroft has taken to acquire you.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.223
Oh, you work for Bancroft.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.601
Exclusively. May I have my...

03:05.018 --> 03:05.935
Where's my clothes?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.272
If by "clothes" you mean
those bloodstained rags, here they are.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.609
But I took the liberty
of procuring habiliments

03:12.692 --> 03:16.487
more appropriate for your position
as a confidant of a Meth.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.324
He's not a confidant. He's a hired gun.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.577
Take her downstairs.
And if it's not too much trouble,

03:22.660 --> 03:25.371
don't let anyone else
into my fucking room.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.338
<i>Lights on, 20%.</i>

03:38.301 --> 03:39.552
Hey, Hawkeye.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.638
<i>Hello, Lieutenant Ortega.</i>

03:41.721 --> 03:44.182
<i>Would you like information on the target?</i>

03:44.265 --> 03:47.477
I slept great, thanks. You?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.605
<i>I'm afraid I don't understand </i>
<i>the question.</i>

03:51.022 --> 03:54.609
That's a nicer answer
than most guys I wake up next to.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.278
<i>I'm afraid I don't understand </i>
<i>the question.</i>

03:57.362 --> 03:58.780
Forget it, Hawkeye.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.158
Just let me know if Kovacs goes anywhere.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.258
This is not how normal people
start the day.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.135
-Coffee, cereal maybe.
-Come on.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.805
Toast.
Maybe even toast with another person--

04:23.888 --> 04:26.015
-I don't want any toast.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.770
It can be nice,
wake up next to someone, have toast.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.193
I don't want to hear your suggestions
for my personal life.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.654
What personal life would that be

04:54.210 --> 04:55.461
You need to blank this noise.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.967
Doesn't matter who Kovacs is,
you can't let him rattle you this much.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
I know Bancroft's
yanking your chain so hard

05:03.928 --> 05:05.596
-you're gonna get whiplash.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.017
One more round?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.185
-That was a tracker.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.438
Except, of course, it can't be,

05:13.521 --> 05:15.898
since we don't have a warrant
on any of our open cases.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.903
You know, if I saw this,
I'd have to report it.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.200
So it's a good thing I didn't.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.828
Don't thank me. Just stop.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.497
Forget about Kovacs.
There's nothing there.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.291
You think I don't know that?

06:05.156 --> 06:07.992
Hawkeye, target location.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.079
<i> Processing target movements.</i>

06:11.746 --> 06:14.916
<i>Target is in Psychasec, Mission Branch.</i>

06:18.586 --> 06:20.088
<i>Welcome to Psychasec.</i>

06:20.171 --> 06:22.340
Please step up to the ID plate.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.261
Ms. Prescott. Mr. Kovacs.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.014
Director Nyman will be down in a moment.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.811
Gonna need to interview Bancroft's
associates. Personal and business.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.022
Kind of people in Mr. Bancroft's circle,
it's out of the question.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.318
Go tell your boss you've decided it's too
socially awkward for me to save his life.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.778
I'm sure he'll understand.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.488
For the record,

06:45.571 --> 06:48.699
I consider you to be completely
unqualified as an investigator,

06:48.783 --> 06:49.909
and you can't smoke in here.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.454
Personally, I hate these things, but...

06:53.788 --> 06:55.456
you sleeved me
in a hardcore nicotine addict.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.709
This sleeve is more than adequate
for your needs.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.169
I doubt you'll be using it long.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.298
Ms. Prescott.
I've cleared my schedule for the morning.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.051
As I said earlier, whatever I can do.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.761
There's no smoking.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.433
At Psychasec,
we provide the top of the market

07:13.516 --> 07:15.601
in augmented
and designer-enhanced sleeves.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.772
Our service is exclusive
to an elite clientele.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.734
<i>Best sleeve money can buy.</i>
<i>Put your wife in me.</i>

07:24.152 --> 07:25.820
Hmm. How tasteful.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.865
Our primary business is in clones.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.450
No doubt you know a single clone

07:30.533 --> 07:32.577
costs more than most people make
in a lifetime.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.370
So Meths only.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.333
Our clients are the most discerning,
wealthiest people in the Protectorate.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.045
They don't do anything as pedestrian
as dying.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.632
<i>You deserve to look on the outside</i>
<i>the way you feel on the inside. </i>

07:47.216 --> 07:48.468
<i>You deserve this sleeve.</i>

07:53.681 --> 07:56.934
This is the Bancroft family vault.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.562
We keep 24/7 tech personnel in the vault.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.899
Gus was here the night Mr. Bancroft
needlecast back from Osaka.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.200
They aren't aware, right?

08:12.283 --> 08:15.411
Nah, clones' brains are blanked,
stacks are empty.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.247
The bodies
are electrically stimulated periodically

08:18.331 --> 08:19.582
so they don't lose muscle tone.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.294
Gonna need to see any footage you have
of Bancroft's arrival.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.837
Back when I went down,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.548
you resleeve too many times,
eventually you go nuts.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.718
Personality frag. It's a bitch.

08:30.801 --> 08:34.180
But it only happens if you bounce
between lots of different sleeves.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.766
So, turns out, if you resleeve
into your own clone,

08:36.849 --> 08:38.643
you can do it as many times as you want.

08:38.726 --> 08:42.605
-And live forever. If you got the cash.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.190
What does everyone else do?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.860
Folks resleeve in whatever they can find,
if they can afford it.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.781
So your clients needlecast directly
into the clones here in the building?

08:51.864 --> 08:55.993
Our lower levels house a fully secure
satellite-to-download DHF facility.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.871
It can't be that secure if someone
tried to hack Bancroft's backup

08:58.955 --> 09:01.457
-the night he was shot.
-Police think it was Dippers. They steal snippets of Meth memory
during uplink.

09:04.126 --> 09:07.880
Moments from a king's childhood,
a socialite losing her virginity.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.174
-Oh, it happens all the time.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.760
Black market value is huge
for a slice of those memories.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.221
Got the file. Here you go.

09:30.111 --> 09:30.987
That's it?

09:31.070 --> 09:34.615
We only record the moment of reacclimation
for quality control.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.285
Anything more would infringe
on our clients' privacy.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.457
And I do so value my privacy,
as Christopher well knows.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.753
Christopher, so good to see you.
-It is our privilege to be of assistance.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.213
Good morning, Mr. Kovacs.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.925
I told Oumou here that I wanted to drop in

09:53.009 --> 09:55.970
and observe your investigation
at close quarters.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.098
You were here the night
your husband resleeved?

10:00.224 --> 10:04.103
Yes. When Laurens travels for business,
I like to meet him when he casts back.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.605
When was this footage taken?

10:06.105 --> 10:09.191
-Six hours before Mr. Bancroft was killed.

10:09.400 --> 10:14.030
I know I'm watching myself, but it feels
as if I'm watching a stranger.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.199
What were you doing in Osaka,
before you came back?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.119
Mr. Bancroft closed
a 400 billion credit trade deal.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.706
Which I also have no memory of.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.541
And your associates there were questioned?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.710
They saw nothing amiss
with Mr. Bancroft.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.880
On the contrary,
they remarked on his focus and skill.

10:30.963 --> 10:36.552
Yes, I still have no idea how I managed
to pull that together quite so quickly.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.222
And then you needlecast back here.
What did you do after?

10:40.306 --> 10:44.352
I went home. I'm afraid Laurens
had more energy than I did.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.603
Hmm. And you?

10:46.395 --> 10:49.398
Security cameras at Suntouch House
recorded Mr. Bancroft

10:49.482 --> 10:51.859
arriving home in the morning.
I'll get you the footage.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.364
You don't do anything for yourself do you,
including answering questions?

10:56.447 --> 11:00.534
I've told you, Mr. Kovacs,
it's all a complete blank.

11:02.078 --> 11:07.249
I'm struggling to see the point
of this, um... interrogation.

11:07.625 --> 11:12.755
The one person who is certainly
not a suspect in all of this... is me.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.174
You want answers,
they come with questions attached.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.221
Let's take a walk, Mr. Kovacs.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.106
Just to be clear, if I die,
you go back on ice.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.317
If you don't solve this quickly enough,
you go back on ice.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.694
All this trust is just making me tear up.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.864
Don't threaten me again.

11:41.992 --> 11:45.079
-I'm not sure if I'm enjoying your tone.
-Get used to it.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.790
I'm gonna need access that
you don't wanna give,

11:47.873 --> 11:50.668
and I'm gonna find answers
you may only think you want.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.838
You wanted me to work for you.
I'm working for you.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.381
You want my respect?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.385
That's a little harder to come by.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.138
If you don't like it,
put me back on ice right now.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.976
I admire a man who can look over the edge
without flinching.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.978
Might make a Meth of you yet.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.983
I've downloaded the footage
to your hotel from Suntouch House.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.445
I'll need to see the interviews
of all the suspects as well,

12:17.528 --> 12:19.613
and any threats that Bancroft's received.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.408
Why are you here, Lieutenant?

12:22.908 --> 12:24.160
You took the job.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.163
-Man's gotta eat.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.333
Don't you have actual policing
to do somewhere?

12:31.417 --> 12:34.295
You have any leads on who tried to kill me
in the hotel last night?

12:34.378 --> 12:37.882
The lack of surviving witnesses
is a problem, but I'm working on it.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.049
I feel safer already.

12:39.133 --> 12:43.012
Yeah, I know. I'm coming.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.767
Be seeing you, Kovacs.
Try not to get yourself killed.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.562
Shouldn't be a problem.
Who'd want to kill me?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.206
Hello, boy-os.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.043
Hmm. Well, holy shit.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.796
Hey there, Poe. Long time.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.008
How long’s it been, 50 years?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.552
Actually, 47 years.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.222
I thought you only lived
in the real these days.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.433
It grieves me that my account
languishes in arrears.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.101
I must restore my standing

13:31.185 --> 13:34.271
with my brothers and sisters
in the AI hotel union.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.274
We're the AI management union now.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.735
Yeah, Owen's turned himself
into a music hall.

13:40.152 --> 13:44.698
And Rodney has a strip club,
calls himself Z-Rod.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.368
And Maddy--
-I'm well aware who Maddy works with.

13:47.451 --> 13:50.204
Or rather... for.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.124
You bring credit to pay your back dues?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.793
I have a guest.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.921
Ooh!
Grab a seat. We'll deal you in.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.591
Mmm.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.304
Why you always pretend to be one of them?

14:07.388 --> 14:12.268
Dress like 'em, talk like 'em.
It's so... weird.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.602
I find humans fascinating.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.563
You’re weird!  Who cares about humans?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.815
Who cares?

14:18.607 --> 14:19.900
Humans gave us life.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.779
Yeah, just because Maddy's been enslaved
by one of them,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.823
why hold that against the species?

14:26.407 --> 14:29.952
They're not like us, Poe.
They're a lesser form of life.

14:30.035 --> 14:30.953
Preach it, brother.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.206
I'm not their servant.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.958
I choose to be the proprietor
of the Raven.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.210
The study of humanity
is my greatest aspiration.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.630
-You gotta work on your life goals, Poe.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.969
My place, Prick Up,
that's the kinda business you gotta be in.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.597
VR sexperience.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.058
Sometimes I use live ones
for the recordings.

14:53.142 --> 14:53.976
Live?

14:54.059 --> 14:57.771
Humans. They make better noises.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.816
And the best thing,
other humans pay you for the playback.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.194
You gotta get out of the business
of serving humans, Poe...

15:05.070 --> 15:07.698
into the business of serving up humans.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.784
You think your guest is gonna stay?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.620
Even after the shootout in your lobby?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.538
-Gunfire...
-Dead bodies...

15:14.622 --> 15:15.706
Police.

15:18.250 --> 15:22.796
No. There were no rats
feasting on the corpses.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.346
Good day.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.730
Watch where you're going.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.952
-Someone's been in there, I'm telling you.
-Ma'am, let's check my file...

16:02.086 --> 16:03.587
You want to tell me where you've been?

16:05.172 --> 16:06.173
Who says I was anywhere?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.092
An empty chair
at this morning's briefing...

16:08.717 --> 16:11.553
three unanswered messages.
You ever check your ONI?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.682
I was worried.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.767
Don't be. I'm fine.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.687
Stop hovering. I have a mother for that.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.355
-Also fine.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.441
Still weird to me that you two
are on a first-name basis.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.652
-Once or twice.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
Ortega!

16:31.573 --> 16:35.369
The Henchy woman is here again.
And I want you to handle it.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.123
But, Captain Tanaka, it's not my case.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.708
I have a philosophy

16:40.791 --> 16:43.419
about uncomfortable conversations
with the recently bereaved.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.087
-I--

16:45.170 --> 16:48.090
Officers who miss the briefing volunteer.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.634
-Handle it.
-Yes, sir.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.728
Shit.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.691
You do it.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.907
You expect me to tell this woman that
the BCPD lost her daughter's body?

17:13.991 --> 17:18.454
Well, Tanaka says the body's not lost.
It'll turn up.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.623
Sooner or later, somebody's gonna have
to tell her the truth.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.542
She's not getting her daughter back.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.925
<i>I just don't understand. </i>

17:34.136 --> 17:37.973
It's been two months,
and no one can explain it to me.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.811
She's dead.
Why haven't you released her body?

17:44.730 --> 17:45.814
I'm looking into it.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.778
Do you know how long it's been
since I talked to my baby?

17:52.279 --> 17:53.447
Three years!

17:54.698 --> 17:57.743
I never got to tell her that I loved her.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.705
Then I find out she converted last year.

18:03.040 --> 18:08.295
So even though her stack was fine,
she can never be spun back up.

18:08.378 --> 18:13.759
I'll never see her again,
not even to say goodbye.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.011
Do you know what that's like?

18:17.805 --> 18:20.099
-I have some idea, yeah.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.687
Because then you would understand why
I need my daughter's body back.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.232
-It's all I have left!
-Ms. Henchy, please calm down.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.943
I don't even know what you people
are doing with her.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.861
How do I know?

18:34.071 --> 18:37.783
Did you sell her for parts?
Because you have no right!

18:38.492 --> 18:41.662
No right, do you hear me?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.678
He looks perky.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.514
Any record from within Suntouch?
-No, there's no cameras inside.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.058
This monitor's a piece of crap.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.602
It's an antique. Like yourself.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.231
That's nifty,
but I still can't see shit on this thing.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.066
I suggest you use your ONI feed.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.946
<i>Bancroft,</i>
<i>you cannot escape your fate...</i>

19:16.029 --> 19:18.198
<i>I want your fucking head removed!</i>

19:18.282 --> 19:19.658
<i> ...shit down your throat.</i>

19:19.741 --> 19:22.911
<i>I'll fucking kill you,</i>
<i>you Meth motherfucker!</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:25.831
<i>I can't wait to see you bleed.</i>
-That's subtle. Hey, Poe!

19:25.914 --> 19:27.749
How many more of these did Prescott send?

19:28.375 --> 19:29.251
Uh...

19:29.334 --> 19:33.380
You have 3,578 death threats left to view.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.465
From this year.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.468
All right, well,
discard all off-world threats.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.721
Break it into three groups.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.223
Threats involving violence...

19:43.682 --> 19:46.018
people who committed actual crimes,
where sender is known...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.271
and mode of violence threatened.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.232
Cross-reference for files that
overlap search parameters.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.650
Delete the rest.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.864
<i>I'm gonna enjoy watching you beg</i>
<i>for your life, you piece of shit!</i>

19:58.947 --> 20:05.162
Rage at injustice is universal.
The ability to strike back is not.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.249
Cross-check for military training
or active combat experience.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.880
<i> I'm gonna double-sleeve you</i>
<i>so you can watch me murder you!</i>

20:15.380 --> 20:20.010
And at its heart, violence is
almost always, in one way or another...

20:21.303 --> 20:22.137
<i>personal.</i>

20:22.763 --> 20:24.681
<i> Counting down to your real death.</i>

20:24.765 --> 20:25.974
Isolate 43.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.103
<i>For my girl. For my Lizzie.</i>

20:31.146 --> 20:32.439
<i>You're a dead man, Bancroft. </i>

20:33.774 --> 20:36.068
<i>I'm gonna hunt you down </i>
<i>on your steel mountaintop</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:37.986
<i>and blow your head off.</i>

20:38.779 --> 20:43.492
<i>Splatter your brains all over the wall, </i>
<i>and melt your stack to slag. </i>

20:45.118 --> 20:47.037
<i>And you'll never see it comin'.</i>

20:49.164 --> 20:50.040
Go back.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.126
Stop. Expand.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.318
<i>Lieutenant Ortega, </i>
<i>target has left the Raven Hotel.</i>

22:12.289 --> 22:15.417
<i>The machinery of justice</i>
<i>won't serve you here.</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:18.295
<i>It is slow and cold and it is theirs.</i>

22:19.254 --> 22:21.423
<i>Hardware and soft.</i>

22:37.355 --> 22:38.982
What the fuck?

22:41.526 --> 22:43.278
What did you do to my goddamn door?

22:43.904 --> 22:45.197
Well, you didn't answer.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.157
Because I'm fucking closed!
Can't you read?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.159
I got a few questions.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.248
<i>For my girl. For my Lizzie.</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:01.755
See, Laurens Bancroft hired me
to investigate his death.

23:01.838 --> 23:02.964
Now, who's Lizzie?

23:03.048 --> 23:06.259
How the hell should I know?
That holo has nothing to do with me.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.762
You see, the military, the cheap bastards,

23:08.845 --> 23:11.431
they issue a weapon,
they keep records on who has it

23:11.515 --> 23:13.308
so they can charge back against your pay.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.894
Tac Marine standard issue AR.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.688
Serial number, you dumb fuck.
You might as well have signed your name.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.320
I heard Bancroft torched his own stack.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.447
And I got drunk to celebrate.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.658
He send you here to kill me?

23:30.867 --> 23:33.662
So you were a Tac Marine. GCE?

23:33.745 --> 23:36.164
Medic. And there is no "was."

23:36.248 --> 23:38.834
Once a marine, always a marine.
Now get out, or I'll shoot.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.377
You stitched people up, huh?

23:40.460 --> 23:42.879
I shot them down, too.
Now get the fuck out.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.465
What the...

24:16.580 --> 24:18.999
You're awake. Good.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.171
Put that down.

24:24.254 --> 24:28.884
Single bed, single dish. Table cleared
just enough for one person...

24:31.469 --> 24:32.762
What about the wife, Elliot?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.056
She dead?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.020
Okay, so not dead.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.773
Maybe she left you
'cause you're a fucking slob.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.983
I mean, look at this place.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.818
Ava didn't leave me, you son of a bitch.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.695
She pulled down 30 years for dipping.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.821
She was a hacker?

24:49.905 --> 24:53.074
Best in the Five Cities.
Until she got caught.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.328
So Ava's your wife.
Which makes Lizzie your daughter.

24:59.664 --> 25:03.043
-Don't worry. You're not my type.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.508
No, stay away from there.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.385
No, don't go in there. Come on!

25:13.887 --> 25:16.306
No, I'll fucking kill you!  Don't! Stay away from there!

25:20.060 --> 25:22.979
<i>Technology advances.</i>
<i>But humans don't.</i>

25:23.688 --> 25:25.690
No, I'll fucking kill you!

25:25.774 --> 25:28.568
No, don't do it! You stay away from there!

25:30.737 --> 25:34.533
<i>We're smart monkeys,</i>
<i>and what we want is always the same.</i>

25:35.200 --> 25:39.829
<i>Food, shelter, sex,</i>
<i>and in all its forms...</i>

25:39.913 --> 25:42.123
No, no, no!
<i> <i>...escape.</i></i>

25:51.758 --> 25:54.719
<i>Wake up and smell the coffee.</i>

25:55.303 --> 25:56.304
<i>Wake up.</i>

26:46.813 --> 26:48.064
You must be Lizzie.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.109
My name is Tak.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.590
Did you hurt her?

27:13.673 --> 27:15.592
If you laid a hand on my daughter...

27:16.301 --> 27:18.219
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:19.012 --> 27:22.223
Can't you tell she's suffering?
She's caught in a trauma loop.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.352
-It's the only way I can see her.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.982
Her body was beaten to death,
but her stack was untouched.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.652
It damaged her mind. She hasn't said a word since that night.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.698
Why do you think Bancroft did it?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.658
'Cause she told me she was seeing him!

27:41.659 --> 27:43.370
She said he needed her.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.872
That he was gonna take care of her.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.669
And then she ended up dead.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.799
I don't want to hurt you.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.418
You gotta get out more, Elliot.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.548
Your milk's a month past the due date.
A month.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.680
You got a hell of a motive.
Military expertise.

28:43.763 --> 28:46.641
So do you, from the looks of it.
That make you a killer?

28:48.393 --> 28:49.769
More times than I can count.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.022
But you didn't kill Bancroft.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.818
I told you I...
I could have. You don't know.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.361
You got the background, skill...

28:58.445 --> 28:59.529
Exactly.

29:01.531 --> 29:05.368
But your daughter? You'd do anything
to protect her. You're not stupid.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.538
You take out Bancroft, sooner or later,
someone like me will show up.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.040
You go down for it,
she's alone in the world.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.463
What's Jack?

29:17.839 --> 29:20.508
-I'm not telling you fuck all.
-Okay.

29:24.929 --> 29:25.930
You're just gonna leave?

29:35.857 --> 29:38.985
That's, um, for the cereal.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.487
And the door.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.031
Sorry about the door.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.634
<i>Welcome to the Battle of Stronghold.</i>

30:04.302 --> 30:07.680
<i>Experience the brutality</i>
<i>of Envoy terrorists</i>

30:07.764 --> 30:10.266
<i>murdering countless women and children.</i>

30:11.267 --> 30:14.687
<i>Witness the Protectorate courage</i>
<i>and triumph.</i>

30:21.778 --> 30:23.446
<i>I knew I shouldn't go...</i>

30:24.572 --> 30:29.536
<i>'cause when the victors rewrite history,</i>
<i>it's just another kind of war,</i>

30:29.619 --> 30:32.330
<i>waged after the battlefield killing</i>
<i>is done...</i>

30:33.248 --> 30:36.167
<i>to murder the memory of the defeated.</i>

30:38.294 --> 30:40.380
<i>But it was a chance to see her again.</i>

30:42.131 --> 30:44.551
<i>Not as a dream or a hallucination.</i>

30:47.136 --> 30:49.430
<i>I thought it would give me</i>
<i>a moment of peace.</i>

30:52.934 --> 30:54.269
<i>I should have known better.</i>

31:14.122 --> 31:15.123
Hey.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.293
You're not supposed to have that.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.380
We're learning about Songspires in school.
They're rare.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.299
Where'd you get it?

31:24.632 --> 31:26.092
I stole it.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.677
Oh.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.263
You're not supposed to
steal things either.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.808
Well, someone... stole these stacks.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.561
They used to be people.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.980
They were Envoy terrorists
that wanted to kill--

31:39.063 --> 31:40.773
Maybe you should catch up with your group.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.526
I don't wanna. Emmeline is there.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.988
She's the new girl in our class,
and she's a bitch.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.823
She stole my best friend Monica.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.201
Me and Monica have been
best friends forever.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.454
-Hmm.
-Since we were little kids.

31:55.121 --> 31:58.082
But then, Emmeline came along
and stole her from me.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.834
I'm devastated.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.045
Mom said grudges are stupid.

32:02.128 --> 32:05.173
She said you had to let them go
or else it would kill your soul.

32:07.967 --> 32:08.885
What do you think?

32:08.968 --> 32:12.764
I think your mom doesn't know
what the fuck she's talking about.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.641
-See, friends are overrated,

32:14.724 --> 32:18.895
'cause eventually, someone will come along
and shoot 'em in the stack.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.230
You're better off alone.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.868
<i>Welcome home.</i>

32:38.122 --> 32:39.415
Hi, Mama.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.710
Just let yourself in anytime you want.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.963
You don't have any food in here.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.424
No one will respect a skinny girl cop.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.802
I'm not going to let you
get yourself killed because you wouldn't eat an enchilada.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.017
Look at this mess.
When are you going to unpack?

32:58.726 --> 33:00.478
I'm busy, that's all.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.065
Too busy to put away your underwear?

33:05.483 --> 33:06.526
I like it like this.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.196
You're waiting for someone to come
and help you unpack,

33:10.279 --> 33:12.115
and it's not your mother.

33:15.243 --> 33:19.622
You know, you could always move
to someplace that's really yours.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.166
Ana Luisa from the cleaners,

33:22.250 --> 33:26.087
she told me there's a whole block
of new places near the Tenderloin.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.256
No, no, Mama. This is my place.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.507
I'm staying.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.634
Yes, of course.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.636
What do I know?

33:34.387 --> 33:38.016
I'm just an old-fashioned woman.
Out of touch.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.602
I've only got this life, and I'm not
planning to have another one.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.896
Not this again.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.066
How am I supposed to explain this
to your brothers and sisters?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.901
Everyone at church?

33:48.985 --> 33:50.945
To your father, God rest his soul?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.114
That you've renounced
your religious coding.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.867
Like you said, Papa's dead.
That should limit the explaining.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.579
Sit down. We're going to eat.

34:02.331 --> 34:07.336
Without your coding, you can be
spun back up after your body dies.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.131
It's wrong.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.551
You can't take your communion.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.304
Father Huerta can't hear your confession.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.058
When Papa died,

34:20.725 --> 34:26.522
and we couldn't ask him what happened
or how it happened--

34:26.606 --> 34:28.441
Your father was a devout man.

34:29.108 --> 34:32.653
He would have never wanted
to be spun back up.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.738
I know.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.574
But if it were me?

34:41.037 --> 34:42.371
What would you do, Mama?

34:44.707 --> 34:48.377
Okay. I'll tell you, Kristin.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.422
My heart would break
into a thousand pieces.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.633
It would shatter my world.

34:55.093 --> 34:58.805
I would cry enough
to fill up the oceans of the world.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.932
And I still...

35:01.891 --> 35:04.435
don't want you to risk your soul.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.272
Now that the 653 stupidity is over,

35:08.981 --> 35:12.110
there won't be any more talk
of spinning up the dead.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
Fuck!

35:15.029 --> 35:16.405
Don't say swear words.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.532
I'm sorry.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.326
<i>Lieutenant Ortega,</i>
<i>target has entered Licktown.</i>

35:20.409 --> 35:21.619
Shit.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.455
What is that, Kristin?
I gotta go.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.833
I gotta go. Thank you.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.960
Are you supposed
to have that at home?

35:29.043 --> 35:31.420
Thanks for dinner!
I love you.

35:40.596 --> 35:43.641
<i>Wake up and smell the coffee.</i>

35:44.433 --> 35:47.270
<i>Wake up and smell the coffee.</i>

35:47.937 --> 35:50.439
<i>-Wake up and smell the coffee.</i>

36:18.259 --> 36:21.387
<i> Welcome to Jack It Off.</i>

36:35.318 --> 36:36.319
Leave the piece with me.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.321
Cabin 102.

36:39.238 --> 36:42.450
Take a towel from the pile,
and don't fucking steal it.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.474
Do you want to see me?
I'm right here, baby.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.644
Just a few credits.

37:23.115 --> 37:26.786
Now, do you want to touch me?

37:34.126 --> 37:35.795
Tell me what you want, honey.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.424
Anemone.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.177
Do you wanna fuck me?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.304
Put your cock in me?

37:46.889 --> 37:48.015
Anywhere you want.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.560
Do you remember a girl...
I think she used to work here.

37:51.644 --> 37:56.983
No girl who used to work here
is gonna do what I can do for you.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.150
Her name was Lizzie.

37:59.819 --> 38:00.945
Lizzie Elliot.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.784
You the sia?
-No.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.537
Get out, before I call for help.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.209
I'm Ava. Ava Elliot. Her mother.

38:15.293 --> 38:20.256
Bullshit.
Lizzie's mom is in the store.

38:20.339 --> 38:22.925
You're just another fucking John,
and I am going to scream.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.302
Wait, wait, wait!

38:26.095 --> 38:28.556
I'm cross-sleeved, but I'm her mother.

38:29.348 --> 38:30.558
You're fucking lying.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.520
I'm not lying.
Someone gave me a job, and...

38:35.229 --> 38:38.107
took me off ice,
and then put me in this sleeve.

38:38.899 --> 38:39.942
It's wetwork.

38:40.609 --> 38:45.239
If I do it, I'll get a new sleeve
for me and for Lizzie.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.075
You...

38:48.784 --> 38:49.744
You'd do that?

38:49.827 --> 38:52.371
I'd do anything for my little girl.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.124
My mom would never...

38:55.958 --> 39:00.629
But someone's blocking
Lizzie's resleeve, and I...

39:00.713 --> 39:02.006
I don't know why.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.550
That's why I have to find out
who killed her.

39:05.301 --> 39:09.055
Do you know if Lizzie had any regulars?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.849
Someone important

39:13.726 --> 39:17.355
Mrs. Elliot... everyone here is a freak.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.734
Lizzie did have one regular.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.361
-No.

39:23.444 --> 39:27.406
I don't know. But he's a rich guy, a Meth.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.241
-Lizzie was his favorite.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.911
No, no, he's not like that.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.163
He takes care of his girls.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.414
Takes care of them how?

39:35.915 --> 39:36.832
Um...

39:37.875 --> 39:38.834
What does he do?

39:58.729 --> 39:59.772
Did he do that to you?

39:59.855 --> 40:03.109
No. No, it's okay.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.528
He's one of the good ones.

40:05.611 --> 40:08.155
-If he breaks it, he buys it.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.909
You know, if he accidentally kills a girl,
he buys her an upgraded sleeve.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.246
I knew a girl once,
he resleeved her ten years younger,

40:15.329 --> 40:17.540
and with a great set of tits, too.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.042
Did Lizzie have a jealous boyfriend

40:20.126 --> 40:23.045
that didn't like her spending time
with this regular?

40:23.629 --> 40:27.341
Look, I liked Lizzie,
but we weren't that close.

40:32.763 --> 40:33.848
I'll ask around.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.559
Come here tomorrow.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.605
Doesn't matter how much anyone pays you.

40:43.899 --> 40:47.611
You shouldn't let anyone hurt you.
You're worth more than that. My name's not Anemone, Mrs. Elliot.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.247
It's Alice.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.926
<i>Thank you for visiting Jack It Off.</i>

41:11.010 --> 41:12.928
<i>Hope you come again.</i>

41:13.012 --> 41:16.098
<i>First thing you'll learn</i>
<i>is that nothing is what it seems.</i>

41:16.599 --> 41:18.434
<i>Ignore your assumptions.</i>

41:19.101 --> 41:20.728
<i>Don't trust anything.</i>

41:27.985 --> 41:28.819
Weapon.

41:29.361 --> 41:32.239
-Ah-ah-ah. Just the charge cell.
-Okay.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.288
You shouldn't have gone after my daughter.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.957
I was just trying to find out
what happened to her.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.626
You left a few things out.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.129
You don't care about her.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.339
I never said I did.

41:53.052 --> 41:53.969
Heads up.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.641
You can't possibly think I'm that stupid.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.275
You shouldn't have come back.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.691
Fuck!

43:01.328 --> 43:03.747
<i>BCPD. Lay down your weapons.</i>

43:04.331 --> 43:07.376
Who the hell are you CTAC?

43:07.459 --> 43:11.046
250 years ago, I was on the other side.
You might want to get out of the light.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.052
<i> Hands in the air!</i>

43:18.345 --> 43:21.015
You're under arrest for Organic Damage.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.103
You're staying here tonight
where I can keep an eye on you.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.483
You gonna tell me
why those guys jumped me?

43:31.817 --> 43:33.652
You walk out of a whorehouse
dressed like that,

43:33.736 --> 43:35.988
and you're shocked
that some lowlifes tried to mug you?

43:36.071 --> 43:37.197
Really?

43:37.281 --> 43:38.741
So, what, you gonna charge me?

43:39.325 --> 43:42.953
For what?
Organic Damage to some Stiff dealers?

43:43.037 --> 43:45.039
I'm too tired to do the paperwork.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.464
Tell me something, Kovacs.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.175
You're getting to know more
about Bancroft.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.595
Why are you still willing to work
for that piece of shit?

44:00.471 --> 44:02.681
Mmm, before I was an Envoy...

44:04.642 --> 44:08.228
I worked for the Protectorate.
For a long time.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.313
I didn't know that.

44:09.396 --> 44:12.941
No one does. It's not the kind of work
that gets logged in any system anywhere.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.487
And I was good at it.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.657
You wanna know why?

44:23.744 --> 44:25.663
Because I'm capable of almost anything.

44:28.457 --> 44:32.127
You don't think it's possible to go so far
you can't come back?

44:32.628 --> 44:33.587
Maybe.

44:35.255 --> 44:36.674
When I get there, I'll let you know.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.133
When you get there...

44:38.967 --> 44:42.304
I'll be right next to you.
And I'll stop you.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.350
Somehow, Ortega...

44:48.394 --> 44:50.646
I get the feeling
you can't even stop yourself.

44:53.399 --> 44:56.568
Sorry, Lieutenant. We have to release him.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.498
This is not acceptable.

45:09.581 --> 45:11.792
-He's just fucking fine.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.003
I'll speak with Captain Tanaka
in the morning.

45:15.337 --> 45:17.673
You've gone too far this time,
Lieutenant Ortega.

45:17.756 --> 45:18.841
That's what I hear.

46:09.850 --> 46:12.811
<i>Cold chamber seven is empty.</i>

46:34.416 --> 46:35.834
You should know...

46:36.919 --> 46:38.754
your mother loves you.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.097
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you promised to send Vicki flowers?</i>

46:49.181 --> 46:51.600
<i>The day of the murder,</i>
<i>I'd driven Vicki to the station</i>

46:51.683 --> 46:53.644
<i>to get her train reservations.</i>

46:53.727 --> 46:56.271
<i> You were with Vicki</i>
<i>the afternoon she was killed?</i>

46:56.355 --> 46:57.356
<i>Yes.</i>

46:57.439 --> 46:58.941
<i>Why didn't you tell the police?</i>

47:04.404 --> 47:05.447
Nice outfit.

47:05.531 --> 47:09.576
I've been researching the famous
gumshoe private dicks of the past

47:10.285 --> 47:14.456
and I believe I can assist you
in the time-honored position

47:14.540 --> 47:19.294
of the shamus' dependable
and steadfast partner. Hmm?

47:19.378 --> 47:21.630
-The partner's frequently murdered.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.258
Alas, me being an AI makes that, uh...

47:24.716 --> 47:25.717
less likely.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.302
No.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.345
No?

47:34.268 --> 47:38.063
"No" hardly qualifies as
the sardonic banter of the private eye.

47:38.146 --> 47:39.982
How about, "Fuck, no"?

47:40.774 --> 47:43.026
There's someone waiting for you
in the penthouse.

47:45.237 --> 47:47.531
Why do you keep letting people
into my room?

47:47.614 --> 47:49.700
I'm afraid I had no choice in the matter.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.359
Why are you here?

48:24.443 --> 48:26.695
I want to know what progress you've made.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.947
I'm worried about my husband.

48:29.031 --> 48:32.117
Your husband, who pays
to beat up whores in Licktown.

48:34.036 --> 48:35.621
It's a complicated thing...

48:36.330 --> 48:38.540
-...being with someone for over a century.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.753
I've given Laurens 21 children.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.048
He's never had a child with anyone but me.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.801
Sometimes, complexity can be exhausting.

48:50.385 --> 48:52.054
You fascinate me.

48:53.972 --> 48:56.266
You come from a time of real bravery...

48:57.267 --> 48:58.727
real risk.

48:59.394 --> 49:01.521
You're everything this world has lost.

49:03.065 --> 49:06.860
You twirl your fingers
when you're nervous, you know that?

49:08.487 --> 49:09.821
Why would I be nervous?

49:10.405 --> 49:11.573
It could be fear.

49:12.407 --> 49:15.494
If I were afraid,
would you save me, Mr. Kovacs?

49:17.162 --> 49:18.664
I'm not sure you need saving.

49:22.334 --> 49:24.294
Have you been with anyone
since you've been decanted?

49:24.378 --> 49:25.462
Not what we're talking about.

49:25.545 --> 49:27.631
Maybe that's not
what <i>you're</i> talking about.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.305
I think that's enough.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.682
Enough?

49:37.724 --> 49:39.226
It's an interesting word.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.019
I'm not familiar with it.

49:42.938 --> 49:44.606
Have you heard of Empathin?

49:46.441 --> 49:49.987
Merge9 on the street.
That is if you can even get it.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.949
It's a biochemical pheromone.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.328
Puts bodies in touch with one other.

50:01.039 --> 50:05.043
This sleeve is state-of-the-art
biochemtech from Nakamura Labs.

50:05.961 --> 50:09.464
I secrete Merge9 when I'm aroused.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.470
It's in my saliva...

50:17.180 --> 50:18.557
in my sweat...

50:21.226 --> 50:22.936
in my cunt.

50:52.048 --> 50:53.592
Don't fight it.

51:11.610 --> 51:14.237
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

51:17.073 --> 51:18.492
I've had lustful thoughts.

51:41.723 --> 51:45.685
Everything you feel... I feel.

51:46.436 --> 51:49.105
And everything I feel, you feel.

51:51.399 --> 51:55.403
I've done terrible things,
violent things...

51:57.864 --> 51:59.324
unforgivable things.

52:04.538 --> 52:05.872
What the fuck?

52:10.127 --> 52:11.586
The hell have you been?

52:20.762 --> 52:23.932
I've abused my authority
for selfish reasons...

52:26.142 --> 52:28.979
caused pain and heartbreak
when I had no right.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.529
Please forgive me.

52:55.797 --> 52:58.592
<i>The moments of peace</i>
<i>that we find sometimes...</i>

52:59.259 --> 53:03.722
<i>they aren't anything but warfare,</i>
<i>thinly disguised.</i>

53:05.849 --> 53:07.767
<i>And sometimes, surrender...</i>

53:08.727 --> 53:10.854
<i>can be as savage as any attack.</i>
