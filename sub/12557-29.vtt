11:02.704 --> 11:04.661
THESE FACTS CAME
TO MY ATTENTION.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.875
"ON THE NIGHT
OF MARCH 12,1961,

11:06.958 --> 11:09.199
"WHILE SERVING IN
THE EMERGENCY WARD

11:09.294 --> 11:12.662
"HE PERMITTED THE DEATH
OF ONE MRS. ANGELA RIENTI

11:12.714 --> 11:14.455
<i>"BY FAILING TO

<i>"ACCUMULATED AS A RESULT

A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT."

11:18.428 --> 11:19.589
<i>IT WAS
TOO LATE--</i>

11:19.679 --> 11:21.386
HE GOT TO
HER TOO LATE.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.258
HE VVAS TAKING CARE OF
HALF A VVARD THAT NIGHT,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.841
<i>WHEN HE GOT TO THE WOMAN,
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.</i>

11:25.894 --> 11:28.101
HE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN
TO HER EARLIER.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.395
THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE
OF IT, MRS. LUCAS.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.358
BY WHAT RIGHT, I MUST
ASK YOU, MR. CRANGLE,

11:38.448 --> 11:40.530
BY WHAT RIGHT
DO YOU PRESUME

11:40.617 --> 11:42.528
TO PASS JUDGMENT
ON MY HUSBAND?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.485
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A MEDICAL MAN.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.536
YOU DON'T KNOW
A THING ABOUT IT

11:46.623 --> 11:49.206
AND YET YOU WRITE
LETTERS TO THE HOSPITAL,

11:49.292 --> 11:50.828
DOZENS OF LETTERS,

11:50.919 --> 11:52.705
ACCUSING MY HUSBAND
OF BEING A MURDERER!

11:52.795 --> 11:55.207
YOU'RE A
FILTHY, MISERABLE...

11:55.298 --> 11:56.788
TELL ME--

11:56.883 --> 11:58.874
HAVE THEY DISCHARGED
YOUR HUSBAND YET?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.800
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING
IT MOMENTARILY.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.377
THEY HAVE NOT.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.962
IT WOULD TAKE MORE
THAN LETTER WRITING

12:04.057 --> 12:06.298
FROM A CRANK
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.384
YOUR HUSBAND
IS AN EVIL MAN!

12:09.479 --> 12:11.971
I VVILL NOT PUT UP VVITH
E\/IL IN ANY FORM--

12:12.065 --> 12:16.434
COMMUNISTS, SUBVERSIVES,
THIEVES, HARLOTS--

12:16.527 --> 12:18.393
EVIL, ALL OF THEM,

12:18.446 --> 12:20.483
AND I VVILL NOT COUNTENANCE E\/IL.
HEAR ME?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.235
I VVILL ABSOLUTELY NOT
COUNTENANCE E\/IL.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.031
HMM.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.414
YOU'RE PROBABLY UNAVVARE OF IT, MR.
CRANGLE,

12:39.509 --> 12:41.921
BUT MY HUSBAND IS
A VERY SENSITIVE MAN.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.756
THE PEOPLE AT THE
HOSPITAL TOLD HIM

12:43.805 --> 12:45.091
TO OVERLOOK
THE LETTERS,

12:45.181 --> 12:46.387
FORGET ABOUT THEM,

12:46.474 --> 12:48.215
BUT THEY'RE
KILLING HIM.

12:53.564 --> 12:58.775
TELL ME,
MR. CRANGLE, WHY...

12:58.861 --> 13:02.320
WHY DO YOU DO IT?

13:02.407 --> 13:03.488
WHY?!

13:06.703 --> 13:09.115
WHY?

13:09.163 --> 13:11.700
YOU ASK ME WHY?

13:11.791 --> 13:16.661
WHY, BECAUSE
THEY'RE EVIL.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.712
THAT'S IT.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.461
THERE'S NOTHING
COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.298
THEY'RE EVIL--

13:25.346 --> 13:30.512
ALL THOSE LITTLE BUGS
OUT THERE-- BACTERIA.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.433
<i>THAT'S WHAT
THEY ARE.</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:34.727
<i>THAT'S WHAT
YOUR HUSBAND lS--</i>

13:34.814 --> 13:36.225
<i>BACTERIA.</i>

13:36.316 --> 13:39.559
THOSE LITTLE...

13:39.652 --> 13:43.486
[laughs wildly]

13:43.573 --> 13:44.734
<i>THAT'S IT!</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:46.656
<i>THAT'S PRECISELY IT!</i>

13:46.701 --> 13:49.910
<i>THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.</i>

13:49.996 --> 13:52.328
I KNEW I WOULD
GET THE CLUE.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.411
I SAID "LITTLE PEOPLE."

13:55.501 --> 13:57.663
DO YOU UNDERSTAND:
"LITTLE PEOPLE"?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.667
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO--

14:05.762 --> 14:10.598
I'LL TURN ALL THE E\/IL
PEOPLE INTO LITTLE ONES.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.349
YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:13.394 --> 14:16.557
I'LL MAKE
EVERY EVIL MAN THREE...

14:16.647 --> 14:19.184
NO, TWO... TWO FEET TALL.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.948
EVERY EVIL MAN

TWO FEET TALL.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.114
[cackles]

14:35.208 --> 14:42.581
A REVELATION...
AN ABSOLUTE REVELATION.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.756
THEY'LL ALL BE
TWO FEET TALL!

MY NAME IS HALL,
MR. CRANGLE

15:56.873 --> 15:59.080
FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INVESTIGATION.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.784
OUR OFFICE HAD
A CALL FROM YOU...

16:01.836 --> 16:04.419
INDEED, INDEED, INDEED,
I PLACED THE CALL.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.793
PLEASE, PLEASE,
SIT DOWN.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.550
NOW, I CALLED
YOU HERE

16:10.636 --> 16:13.378
BECAUSE I FELT THAT THE F.B.l.
SHOULD KNOVV.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.384
IALSO NOTIFIED
THE POLICE

16:15.475 --> 16:17.887
AND THE... THE
FIRE DEPARTMENTS.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.809
I EVEN HAD A CALL
IN TO WASHINGTON,

16:19.896 --> 16:23.230
<i>ALTHOUGH THAT CALL PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN GO THROUGH.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:24.898
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

16:24.984 --> 16:27.066
THAT THE REDS ARE
IN COMPLETE CONTROL

16:27.153 --> 16:28.939
IN WASHINGTON NOW.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.862
THEY'\/E PROBABLY TAKEN
OVER THE SVVITCHBOARD, TOO.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.154
THE REDS, MR. CRANGLE?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.316
OH, YES, THE REDS.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.530
AND IT'S A COMPLETE
CONSPIRACY, YOU KNOW.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.363
ALL THE E\/IL PEOPLE OF THE
VVORLD HA\/E BANDED TOGETHER--

16:39.457 --> 16:42.575
COMMUNISTS,
SUBVERSIVES, THIEVES-

16:42.668 --> 16:46.332
<i>IT'S A TOTAL, COMPLETE
WORLDWIDE CONSPIRACY.</i>

16:46.422 --> 16:48.663
NOVV, MR. CRANGLE, ON
THE PHONE YOU SAID

16:48.716 --> 16:50.377
THAT YOU HAD
SOME SORT OF PLAN...

16:50.468 --> 16:52.004
<i>OH, YES, YES,
YES, YES,</i>

16:52.094 --> 16:53.471
<i>THAT'LL ALL TAKE
PLACE AT 4:00.</i>

16:53.554 --> 16:55.261
NOW, YOU SEE,
MR. HALL,

16:55.348 --> 16:58.340
I HAVE SPENT MANY YEARS
DOING THIS KIND OF WORK.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.850
L'\/E MADE A COMPLETE
STUDY OF E\/IL.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.351
OH, YES, I MADE
A STUDY OF IT.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.602
I LISTEN
TO THE RADIO.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.020
I WATCH TELEVISION.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.519
I CUT OUT
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.434
I WRITE LETTERS
TO EMPLOYERS,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.611
MAKE PHONE CALLS
LATE AT NIGHT.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.689
THERE'S THE MOST EFFICIENT
METHOD, RIGHT THERE.

17:14.784 --> 17:18.152
CALLING THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE
CONSTANTLY LATE AT NIGHT,

17:18.246 --> 17:20.156
WAKING THEM UP--

17:20.248 --> 17:23.115
VVAKING THEM UP, SPEAKING MY
CHARGES AND THEN HANGING UP.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.701
<i>VERY FRUSTRATING
FOR THEM.</i>

17:25.752 --> 17:27.209
YES, I'LL BET.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.003
OH, YES, INDEED.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.797
YOU KNOVV, THEY GO OUT OF
THEIR MIND VVITH FURY.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.045
THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE
VVOKEN UP LATE AT NIGHT,

17:33.135 --> 17:34.796
<i>I CAN ASSURE YOU.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:37.345
WHO DOES,
MR. CRANGLE?

17:37.431 --> 17:40.674
WITH THESE PEOPLE, IT'S
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

17:40.768 --> 17:45.183
BUT TO THE POINT, MR.
HALL, TO THE POINT.

17:45.273 --> 17:49.688
IT IS NOW... 3:27.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.859
IN EXACTLY 33 MINUTES,

17:51.946 --> 17:54.779
ALL THE EVIL PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD

17:54.865 --> 17:56.902
WILL BECOME HALF--

17:56.993 --> 17:59.781
NO, A THIRD
THEIR PRESENT SIZE.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.532
ALL THE
UNCAUGHT MURDERERS

18:02.623 --> 18:04.079
AND THE TYRANTS,

18:04.166 --> 18:07.830
ALL THE BULLIES
AND THE WRONGDOERS--

18:07.920 --> 18:10.412
ALL OF THEM,
EVERY ONE.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.249
NUT.

18:14.302 --> 18:20.173
VVELL, VVHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, MR.
HALL?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.928
MR. CRANGLE, HOW DO YOU
GO ABOUT DOING THIS--

18:23.019 --> 18:26.387
SHRINKING PEOPLE?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.974
WHY, I... I
MERELY WILL IT.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.025
THAT'S ALL.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.776
NOVV IN THE PAST, SEVERAL OTHER
METHODS HAD OCCURRED TO ME

18:36.866 --> 18:39.608
TO STOP EVIL
FROM SPREADING.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.242
HOW DOES EVIL SPREAD?

18:41.329 --> 18:42.490
HMM?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.786
<i>BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT.</i>

18:43.873 --> 18:45.238
SO I HAD
IT IN MIND

18:45.333 --> 18:47.449
THAT I MIGHT TAKE
THE STIFFNESS--

18:47.543 --> 18:49.955
OUT OF
AIRPLANE PROPELLERS.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.787
YOU UNDERSTAND?

18:51.881 --> 18:54.623
PROPS HANGING LIMP...

18:54.675 --> 18:58.634
LIKE EMPTY BANANA SKIN.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.387
THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT I MIGHT CHANGE

19:01.474 --> 19:04.637
ALL THE VVHEELS IN THE
VVORLD FROM ROUND TO SQUARE.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.222
OR PERHAPS TRIANGULAR.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.474
SO THEY'D STUB
IN THE ASPHALT

19:08.564 --> 19:09.895
AND STOP THEM.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.768
MR. CRANGLE...

19:11.859 --> 19:14.851
THIS... YOU KNOW, MR. HALL,
THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.609
THIS IDEA JUST OCCURRED TO ME-
ABOUT THE CHANGE IN SIZE--

19:18.699 --> 19:20.315
JUST A SHORT
WHILE AGO.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.241
SOME BENIGHTED WOMAN
WAS IN HERE

19:22.328 --> 19:25.662
AND SHE INADVERTENTLY
GAVE ME THE lDEA--

19:25.706 --> 19:31.327
TURN ALL THE EVIL PEOPLE
INTO TWO FEET TALL.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.040
NOW WHAT
COULD BE SIMPLER?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.507
THINK OF IT.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.001
<i>THINK OF
HOW INEFFICIENT</i>

19:36.050 --> 19:38.007
<i>THIS WOULD
MAKE THEM.</i>

19:38.094 --> 19:41.507
VVHY, THEY COULDN'T HANDLE
DELICATE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS,

19:41.555 --> 19:44.684
ADDING MACHINES, TYPEWRITERS
OR TELEPHONE DIALS.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.934
WHY, SOON ENOUGH, THEY'D
BE EXTINCT, LIKE DINOSAURS.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.011
[laughing]

19:50.106 --> 19:51.517
NUT.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.440
MR. CRANGLE...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.613
YES?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.611
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION, SIR.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.693
I HOPE YOU WON'T
TAKE OFFENSE AT IT.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.619
OH, NO, NO,
PLEASE, GO ON.

20:06.706 --> 20:11.121
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
ANY PSYCHIATRIC HELP?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.416
WHAT?

20:12.503 --> 20:14.710
PSYCHIATRIC HELP.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.292
MR. CRANGLE, YOU DON'T
SEEM RATIONAL TO ME.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.466
I... I THINK YOU'VE DEVELOPED
SOME KIND OF OBSESSION HERE.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.760
<i>I THINK YOU
NEED SOME HELP.</i>

20:22.847 --> 20:24.929
HELP? I NEED...

20:25.015 --> 20:27.973
WHY SHOULD I NEED HELP?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.892
I'M NOT EVIL.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.803
I'M VERY SORRY,
MR. CRANGLE,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.229
BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM VERY
MUCH VVE CAN DO ABOUT THIS.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.686
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:35.776 --> 20:37.392
WHY, THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

20:37.486 --> 20:40.228
<i>ARE GONNA HAVE ROUND-THE-
CLOCK SCHEDULES.</i>

20:40.322 --> 20:42.029
DON'T YOU REALIZE

20:42.116 --> 20:44.073
HOVV MANY E\/IL PEOPLE
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND?

20:44.118 --> 20:46.610
WHY, THEY'LL BE ALL
OVER THE SIDEWALKS,

20:46.704 --> 20:48.570
ALL OVER THE STREETS!

20:48.664 --> 20:50.405
YOU'LL HAVE TO
BUILD MORE JAILS,

20:50.499 --> 20:56.916
MORE ELECTRIC
CHAIRS, GALLOWS.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.963
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
IT, MR. HALL?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.585
VVHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

21:00.676 --> 21:04.089
NOTHING, MR. CRANGLE,
NOT A THING.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.470
MR. CRANGLE, VVE HA\/E
SOMETHING IN THIS COUNTRY

21:06.557 --> 21:09.140
WHICH MAKES ALL OF THAT
STUFF QUITE UNNECESSARY.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.887
WHAT'S THAT?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.594
IT'S THE LAVV, MR. CRANGLE,
VVE HA\/E THE LAVV.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.190
NOW, WE LIKE
PEOPLE'S HELP

21:14.273 --> 21:16.105
AND THEIR SUPPORT,
THEIR COOPERATION,

21:16.192 --> 21:20.277
BUT INTERFERENCE IS
QUITE ANOTHER MATTER.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.694
OH, I GET IT NOW.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.693
I UNDERSTAND.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.113
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.865
WHY, I WAS AN IDIOT

21:29.955 --> 21:32.242
NOT TO HAVE REALIZED
IT SOONER.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.119
OF COURSE.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.292
OF COURSE YOU PEOPLE HA\/E
GOTTEN INTO THE F.B.l.!

21:36.337 --> 21:37.919
<i>IT STANDS TO REASON.</i>

21:38.005 --> 21:40.212
WHY, YOU--YOU'VE
INFILTRATED EVERY PLACE.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.791
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MR. HALL,

21:42.885 --> 21:44.592
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.715
ENJOY YOURSELF FOR THE
NEXT 15 OR 2O MINUTES,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.888
YOU BETTER ENJOY
YOURSELF TO THE UTMOST,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.931
