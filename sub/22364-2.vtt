<i>The Seven Wonders</i>
<i>of the World...</i>

00:05.912 --> 00:08.614
<i>Christ the Redeemer...</i>

00:08.615 --> 00:11.116

00:11.117 --> 00:12.718

00:12.719 --> 00:16.589
<i>truly man's</i>

00:16.590 --> 00:20.092
<i>But there's one man</i>
<i>who sees them differently.</i>

00:20.093 --> 00:21.427
Like a pylon.

00:23.163 --> 00:25.464
<i>Karl Pilkington.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:28.467
I don't know
the politically correct term.

00:28.468 --> 00:30.102
"Moron," I think.

00:30.103 --> 00:35.975
He is a round, empty-headed,
chimp-like, manc moron.

00:35.976 --> 00:37.977
Buffoon, idiot.
Is that normal?

00:37.978 --> 00:38.978
And he's a friend.

00:38.979 --> 00:40.646
He's a typical
little Englander,

00:40.647 --> 00:43.415
and he doesn't like going out
of his comfort zone.

00:43.416 --> 00:45.317
My bollocks are squashed.

00:45.318 --> 00:47.052
I just think
that it would be amazing

00:47.053 --> 00:48.521
to send him around the world.

00:48.522 --> 00:53.459
What we'd like to see is him
experience other cultures,

00:53.460 --> 00:56.629
other peoples,
and see if in any way,

00:56.630 --> 00:59.365
we can change his outlook
on the world.

00:59.366 --> 01:01.100
I've been
to many exotic places.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.868
I genuinely think travel
broadens the mind.

01:02.869 --> 01:04.537
I want him to hate it.

01:04.538 --> 01:07.740
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

01:07.741 --> 01:10.509
Nothing is funnier

01:10.510 --> 01:13.779
than Karl in a corner
being poked by a stick.

01:13.780 --> 01:14.777
I am that stick.

01:14.977 --> 01:17.825
And now I have the might of Sky behind me.

01:20.601 --> 01:23.715
This is one of the funniest,
most expensive practical jokes

01:23.716 --> 01:26.584
I've ever done,
and it's gonna be great.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.351
Just let me go!
No.

01:29.352 --> 01:30.696
Jesus Christ.

01:35.587 --> 01:37.888
Now, this, you must be excited
about seeing, surely.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.223
This truly, without question,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.291
is one of the seven wonders
of the world...

01:41.292 --> 01:42.993
the extraordinary Taj Mahal.

01:42.994 --> 01:44.394
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.997
Built in the 17th century.

01:46.998 --> 01:49.733
It took them 22 years
to construct it.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.068
Well, that's no good, is it?

01:51.069 --> 01:53.170
If that were happening now,
you'd go, "What are they doing?"

01:53.171 --> 01:54.905
It's the 17th century!

01:54.906 --> 01:57.341
A man who builds a mausoleum
for his dead wife,

01:57.342 --> 01:59.176
so heartbroken is he.

01:59.177 --> 02:01.845
Guilty. He obviously did something bad
when she was alive.

02:01.846 --> 02:04.648
That's like, you know, giving
someone flowers, isn't it?

02:04.649 --> 02:06.316
I've never had to do that.
I've never felt guilty.

02:06.317 --> 02:07.818
You've never thought, "I'll just
give Suzanne some flowers"?

02:07.819 --> 02:10.354
No, 'cause she'd be going, "Well,
all right, what's been going on?"

02:10.354 --> 02:12.956
If I built her that, she'd be
going, "What's been going on?"

02:15.994 --> 02:18.195
Why did he feel
he had to do that?

02:18.196 --> 02:21.498
Because he loved her so much.
It was a shrine to her memory.

02:21.499 --> 02:23.133
Yeah.

02:34.379 --> 02:35.679
Just a little elephant

02:35.680 --> 02:37.080
going down the street there.

02:37.081 --> 02:39.850
I can't imagine them
being that good

02:39.851 --> 02:41.418
as a way of getting about.

02:41.419 --> 02:43.320
To me, that's like
how people moan in London

02:43.321 --> 02:44.821
about people having 4x4s.

02:44.822 --> 02:47.891
You don't need an animal
of that size to get about.

02:47.892 --> 02:49.192
It's way too big.

02:51.796 --> 02:55.899
Getting ill is me biggest worry
about being here.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.567
I hate being ill.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.070
You know, Suzanne isn't around.
I'm on me own.

03:00.071 --> 03:04.007
If I get ill, I'll just have to
mope about on me own.

03:04.008 --> 03:06.677
Oh, it's definitely the poorest
place I've ever been to,

03:06.678 --> 03:08.645
you know, without a doubt.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.582
I don't know if I'll be able
to get used to that.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.953
Runaway horse.

03:15.954 --> 03:17.554
Stew me head in this.

03:17.555 --> 03:20.524
I mean, I'm meant to be meeting
a local fellow

03:20.525 --> 03:22.592
who rides one of these rickshaw
things for a living,

03:22.593 --> 03:26.396
and Rick and Steve thought it'd
be a good idea for some reason.

03:26.397 --> 03:29.599
I can't work out
what reason it is, though.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.001
This is madness.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.437
It's like standing
in the middle of a motorway.

03:33.438 --> 03:35.572
I mean, what a place to meet
a fellow who's got a rickshaw.

03:36.908 --> 03:38.408
Me eyes have never been so busy.

03:38.409 --> 03:41.345
There's always something there
going, "Look at me!"

03:41.346 --> 03:42.746
And then you go, "Look at that,"
and as you turn that way,

03:42.747 --> 03:45.215
you see something over there,
so you're like that.

03:45.216 --> 03:47.918
By the end of today, me neck
will be well and truly worn out,

03:47.919 --> 03:49.386
'cause it doesn't normally
move that fast.

03:49.387 --> 03:51.588
There's layers of madness.

03:51.589 --> 03:55.158
I mean, what is that?
Where is he taking that?

03:55.159 --> 03:57.194
You can't say
he's taking it to the tip

03:57.195 --> 03:59.529
'cause his shit everywhere.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.465
They just overload the bikes
so much

04:01.466 --> 04:03.467
that you just kind of think...

04:03.468 --> 04:05.802
"Get a van."

04:05.803 --> 04:08.405
Is there
any distinguishing features

04:08.406 --> 04:09.639
in this fellow's rickshaw?

04:16.247 --> 04:17.981
Aashiq?
Yeah, yeah.

04:19.483 --> 04:22.252
Do you?

04:22.253 --> 04:24.021
Okay.

04:24.022 --> 04:25.989
It's a bit of a mad place
to sit and have a discussion.

04:25.990 --> 04:27.124
Yeah, yeah.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.393
Oncoming traffic.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.394
Ohh.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.528
Aah.

04:31.529 --> 04:34.464
What the fucking hell
is going on?

04:34.465 --> 04:35.966
Look at this bus up me ass here.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.300
Ohh.

04:37.301 --> 04:38.668
That's good. Like that.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.203
This is no way
of getting around.

04:40.204 --> 04:42.806
Aah.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.541
We're going through
someone's cricket game.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.209
How long have I been here?

04:46.210 --> 04:48.178
I haven't even been in
a full day yet.

04:48.179 --> 04:49.946
I thought
the day was going to end

04:49.947 --> 04:52.282
with, you know...
At least have a good night's kip.

04:52.283 --> 04:53.350
That's not going to happen now.

04:53.351 --> 04:54.885
Aashiq's just invited me
to stay with him.

04:54.886 --> 04:56.887
He lives in the back of a shop.

04:56.888 --> 04:58.822
You got a shop.
You live in it, as well?

04:58.823 --> 04:59.956
Yeah.

05:01.893 --> 05:03.727
The rickshaw.
Yeah.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.001
Hiya.
This is Punjab.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.436
Cousin, eh?

05:22.313 --> 05:24.514
Um...

05:24.515 --> 05:27.050
I'll just sit down there,
if that's all right.

05:28.986 --> 05:30.887
So, how would you sleep here?

05:30.888 --> 05:33.123
Yeah.
What, just flat out there?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.925
Yeah.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.464
Tonight, how many
will be sleeping here?

05:43.101 --> 05:44.334
Can you understand

05:44.335 --> 05:47.070
why this is a little bit
of a shock to me?

05:52.543 --> 05:56.446
When I found out that he ran
a shop from where he lived,

05:56.447 --> 05:59.182
I kind of thought it'd be,
you know, how you see chippers,

05:59.183 --> 06:01.118
and they've sort of got
a living room in the back.

06:01.119 --> 06:02.619
And when you walk in,
the bell goes,

06:02.620 --> 06:04.855
and they run out from watching
"Emmerdale Farm" or whatever

06:04.856 --> 06:06.223
and they say,
"What do you want?"

06:06.224 --> 06:07.357
"I'll have cod and chips."

06:07.358 --> 06:08.792
That's what I was expecting.

06:08.793 --> 06:11.461
Not sort of a...

06:11.462 --> 06:12.929
I mean, what is this?

06:12.930 --> 06:15.966
It isn't a living space, is it?

06:15.967 --> 06:17.234
What's it lacking?

06:17.235 --> 06:20.003
What's it lacking?

06:20.004 --> 06:21.705
I mean,
there isn't even a toilet.

06:21.706 --> 06:23.473
Actually,
that's just only just hit me.

06:23.474 --> 06:26.977
I was worrying about having to
use a traditional toilet.

06:26.978 --> 06:28.912
There isn't one,
so that's that worry gone.

06:28.913 --> 06:32.282
But, then, what do we do?

06:52.069 --> 06:53.370
Okay?

06:53.371 --> 06:54.771
So we're not staying here
tonight?

06:54.772 --> 06:56.840
No, no, no.

06:56.841 --> 06:59.643
What makes you think I would be
happier in this other place?

06:59.644 --> 07:00.810
Have they got a toilet?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.345
Yeah.

07:02.346 --> 07:03.880
Let's go, then.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.182
Yeah, let's go.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.384
Good.
You've sold it to me.

07:14.325 --> 07:16.459
This is more like it.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.628
This will do.

07:20.431 --> 07:22.132
Toilet. Brilliant.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.401
Well, how do you go?
I don't understand the...

07:24.402 --> 07:26.403
Go, go, go.
Turn, turn.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.438
Hold on a minute.
I'm just getting me balance.

07:28.439 --> 07:29.606
Yeah.

07:31.442 --> 07:32.842
No paper?

07:32.843 --> 07:35.779
I don't think I'll be able
to go like this.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.216
Me body's
just not used to this.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.754
I know, but do you understand
how difficult it is for me?

07:44.755 --> 07:46.856
I've come from London.
Yeah.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.692
Less than 24 hours ago,

07:48.693 --> 07:53.496
I was sat in one, newspaper...
quite happy.

07:53.497 --> 07:55.365
Not even 24 hours ago.

07:55.366 --> 07:57.000
And now you're saying,
"Come in here,

07:57.001 --> 07:58.568
give it that,
you'll be all right."

07:58.569 --> 08:00.036
It's not as easy as that
for me.

08:00.037 --> 08:03.873
My insides won't allow it
to happen.

08:05.209 --> 08:06.776
It can't possibly be better.

08:08.079 --> 08:10.880
Splash back. I didn't want
to get into detail.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.182
No, no, no.

08:13.517 --> 08:16.052
Well, you'll see tomorrow.

08:16.053 --> 08:18.154
'Cause I'll tell you what,
I'm getting first dibs on this.

08:18.155 --> 08:20.323
And you'll see tomorrow if it's
better when you come in here

08:20.324 --> 08:22.058
and you'll go, "Good God,
who's been in here?"

08:22.059 --> 08:23.460
Let's see how good it is.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.462
You're laughing
because you know I'm right.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.465
Right.
Hopefully, I won't need to go.

08:31.332 --> 08:33.400
Well, I didn't
sleep well last night, did I?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.034
I'm still shattered
from yesterday.

08:35.035 --> 08:37.236
I mean,
that was a mental first day.

08:37.238 --> 08:38.672
It doesn't look like
it's gonna end, either.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.741
I mean, Aashiq's just given me
some pajamas to wear.

08:40.741 --> 08:42.842
He said, "Oh, you'll be needing
these for your next surprise."

08:42.844 --> 08:44.244
I don't know what it is.

08:44.245 --> 08:46.313
You know, I mean, surprises
are meant to be nice things,

08:46.314 --> 08:47.581
aren't they?

08:47.582 --> 08:50.417
What's up, Karl?

08:50.418 --> 08:52.586
I just got a text from Steve.

08:52.587 --> 08:54.087
"Hi, Karl.

08:54.088 --> 08:56.323
India's not all poverty
and urban chaos, mate."

08:56.324 --> 08:58.792
Well, obviously he hasn't
been here, 'cause it is.

08:58.793 --> 09:00.694
So, straightaway,
that's annoyed me.

09:00.695 --> 09:03.263
"Time to get your ass up north

09:03.264 --> 09:05.899
"for some exposure
to the spiritual side of India.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.202
"The biggest religious festival
on the planet.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.137
Only 20 million pilgrims
expected."

09:10.138 --> 09:12.306
He knows I hate crowds.

09:12.307 --> 09:13.607
"Just one hurdle...

09:13.608 --> 09:16.677
To get there, it's an eight-hour
overnight bus ride."

09:19.080 --> 09:21.014
Excuse me.
What's all this?

09:22.150 --> 09:24.318
Why are they covered in...

09:26.754 --> 09:29.756
Yes, yes, yes!
Holi day!

09:29.757 --> 09:31.758
I want to go
to the bus station now.

09:31.759 --> 09:33.393
Bus station?
You know, the big bus?

09:33.394 --> 09:35.696
Big...

09:41.503 --> 09:43.036
I don't know what's going on.

09:44.539 --> 09:47.941
Just everybody just looks like
they're painter and decorators.

09:47.942 --> 09:51.144
Everyone is just caked
in colors.

09:51.145 --> 09:53.647
Happy holi!

09:55.083 --> 09:56.950
I just hope we don't stop
at any more traffic lights

09:56.951 --> 09:58.252
'cause every time we stop,

09:58.253 --> 10:00.454
someone slaps me face
with a load of color.

10:00.455 --> 10:04.057
Uh, the bus is coming up.

10:04.058 --> 10:07.728
Buses.
Is this the bus station?

10:07.729 --> 10:09.663
Bus station?
I'm trying to get a bus.

10:09.664 --> 10:10.664
You come with me.

10:10.665 --> 10:11.698
Buses down here, yeah?

10:20.542 --> 10:21.575
Your family?

10:25.380 --> 10:27.848
Happy holi.

10:27.849 --> 10:30.017
Happy holi!

10:30.018 --> 10:31.385
Happy holi!

10:31.386 --> 10:33.620
What are we doing here?

10:33.621 --> 10:34.955
Happy holi! Happy holi!

10:34.956 --> 10:36.223
Happy holiday.

10:36.224 --> 10:38.659
I mean, normally,
if I'm messing about with paint,

10:38.660 --> 10:40.527
I'm quite a tidy worker.

10:40.528 --> 10:42.262
This wouldn't happen.

10:42.263 --> 10:45.666
But I didn't have the time
to not do it, did I?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.634
He said, "Come and meet me family."
I'm like, "All right."

10:47.635 --> 10:49.202
Then next thing you know,
he's like... Boof!

10:49.203 --> 10:50.637
Ain't it great?!

10:50.638 --> 10:54.608
I mean, it is paintball,
basically, without the safety.

10:54.609 --> 10:59.212
There's no goggles involved.
It was just... Boof!

11:03.651 --> 11:05.319
It was good that, you know,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.788
Aashiq was concerned
about me clothing

11:07.789 --> 11:09.723
and he gave me something
to wear today.

11:09.724 --> 11:12.259
He could have told me
about the shoes, you know?

11:12.260 --> 11:13.727
I mean, that's all very well,

11:13.728 --> 11:15.262
telling me, like,
to worry about a t-shirt

11:15.263 --> 11:17.164
that I think was,
like, 12 quid from Topman.

11:17.165 --> 11:18.332
I've got 70-quid trainers on.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.133
He didn't tell me
to take them off.

11:20.134 --> 11:23.070
So they're knackered.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.375
Yesterday,
I thought I'd got used to it.

11:28.376 --> 11:30.243
I thought,
"Right, I'll be okay tomorrow."

11:30.244 --> 11:32.679
Just when you think,
"Right, I know what India means,

11:32.680 --> 11:34.581
and I know
what it's all about"...

11:35.783 --> 11:37.117
...This happened.

11:39.020 --> 11:41.021
Anyway, where's this bus stop?

11:52.367 --> 11:54.501
I'm not well, honestly.

11:54.502 --> 11:58.105
I feel really sick, got a fever.

11:58.106 --> 12:00.874
I can't tell if I'm sort of...
Got a bad fever,

12:00.875 --> 12:03.577
'cause, you know,
I can't tell what color I am

12:03.578 --> 12:05.946
with all the dye.

12:07.382 --> 12:09.716
But, um... What's that?

12:09.717 --> 12:12.352
I don't care anymore.

12:12.353 --> 12:15.856
I just sort of feel like
if I'm gonna shit meself,

12:15.857 --> 12:18.058
I will.

12:18.059 --> 12:22.362
'Cause I just feel
that sort of ill.

12:24.832 --> 12:27.601
Has that been used?

12:32.707 --> 12:34.608
Is that it? Is that the...

12:34.609 --> 12:36.309
Oh, there's a queue here.

12:36.310 --> 12:38.345
I'll just...
Who's helping me out?

12:40.148 --> 12:42.516
Yeah? It's all right.
Sorry. Just a quick one.

12:42.517 --> 12:45.318
Just a ticket to Haridwar.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.756
He kicked it off.
I knew that would happen.

12:49.757 --> 12:52.759
Yeah. Yeah.
I know. I know.

12:54.929 --> 12:58.865
I mean, at the end of the day,
are these all for the same bus?

12:58.866 --> 13:00.267
You know?

13:00.268 --> 13:03.303
I don't want to be sat on a bus
for eight hours with some people

13:03.304 --> 13:05.272
who, you know,
are pissed off with me.

13:05.273 --> 13:07.974
Hello. Excuse me.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.712
Excuse me.

13:11.713 --> 13:13.647
I'll tell you what...

13:13.648 --> 13:16.450
It doesn't matter how amazing
that Taj Mahal is.

13:16.451 --> 13:19.953
It's not worth all this.
And I haven't even seen it yet.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.321
But I'm telling you that now.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.491
And that isn't good...
going with attitude.

13:24.492 --> 13:25.792
Alan Whicker...

13:25.793 --> 13:28.562
He did all these travel shows
years ago.

13:28.563 --> 13:31.364
A smart fellow with a suit on.
Never saw him covered in shit.

13:31.365 --> 13:33.767
Never saw him knackered,
whinging, moaning.

13:33.768 --> 13:35.936
People will be watching it going,
"Oh, what's wrong with you?

13:35.937 --> 13:37.671
It's India.
What did you expect?"

13:37.672 --> 13:39.072
Yeah, well, you're not here,
are you?

13:42.610 --> 13:46.179
Received 4:58 P.M.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.650
I don't know anything
about the festival,

14:23.651 --> 14:25.652
just, you know,
other than what Steve told me

14:25.653 --> 14:27.954
about it being
a massive religious thing,

14:27.955 --> 14:29.790
and it's by a famous river,

14:29.791 --> 14:31.591
you know, the Ganges,
which I've heard of.

14:31.592 --> 14:33.627
But other than that,
I don't know why I'm going.

14:33.628 --> 14:35.695
And on top of all that,
you know, Ricky's told me

14:35.696 --> 14:37.931
that I'm staying at a place
called Lahore House.

14:37.932 --> 14:39.166
Sounds good, doesn't it?

14:39.167 --> 14:40.500
Your tent is ready.

14:40.501 --> 14:42.569
Tent?
Yes.

14:42.570 --> 14:43.770
A tent. Brilliant.

14:43.771 --> 14:46.773
I haven't slept,
and I'm being put in a tent.

14:46.774 --> 14:48.909
You see?

14:48.910 --> 14:50.644
This is all right.
Yes.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.145
Bathroom.

14:52.146 --> 14:53.914
This is well smart.

14:53.915 --> 14:55.816
I wasn't expecting this.

14:57.051 --> 14:58.919
Brilliant.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.520
Bit of a stretch there
for the toilet paper,

15:00.521 --> 15:03.623
if I'm being picky,
about that distance.

15:03.624 --> 15:06.059
But I'll tell you what.
I am really chuffed.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.895
Yeah, I've been camping,
I've done tents before,

15:08.896 --> 15:11.164
but nothing like this.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.100
I got a normal toilet,

15:14.101 --> 15:16.236
which is handy 'cause of the way
I've been feeling,

15:16.237 --> 15:18.004
nice, comfy bed,

15:18.005 --> 15:20.607
a view of that, you know,
famous river.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.576
I can't ask for more.

15:22.577 --> 15:23.910
A lot of people say,

15:23.911 --> 15:25.779
"I'm going to India
to find meself."

15:27.515 --> 15:29.216
Look at the color of that.

15:29.217 --> 15:31.151
But what happens if I change

15:31.152 --> 15:32.752
and I go home
and I'm all different?

15:32.753 --> 15:34.054
Suzanne's going,
"What's happened to you?"

15:34.055 --> 15:37.157
And then she doesn't like
the new me that I've found.

15:37.158 --> 15:38.658
And then I start to hate meself

15:38.659 --> 15:40.927
because I'm not the person
who I thought I was.

15:40.928 --> 15:42.128
I know who I am. Bloody hell,

15:42.129 --> 15:43.663
I'm getting bills
for Karl Pilkington

15:43.664 --> 15:45.832
left, right, and center,
so I hope I'm him.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.901
'Cause if I'm not,
I'm paying for someone else.

15:56.888 --> 15:59.123
Nothing wrong with this,
is there?

16:00.325 --> 16:02.559
All this space here.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.861
Honestly, I'm happy.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.163
I can stay here now
for the rest of the time here.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.603
If I'm listening
to him doing that,

16:12.604 --> 16:13.937
isn't that me getting involved?

16:13.938 --> 16:15.239
Isn't that enough?

16:17.709 --> 16:21.178
I'm just saying
let's just have a few days here.

16:21.179 --> 16:22.813
That's the Ganges.
I'll look at that.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.615
Isn't that a big part of India?

16:24.616 --> 16:28.418
Let's focus on that for a bit.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.120
It's not very interesting telly

16:30.121 --> 16:32.256
to just stay here
all day, though, Karl.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.224
I don't know
why Steve wants me to go

16:34.225 --> 16:37.227
to this religious festival,
'cause he knows I'm not into it.

16:37.228 --> 16:40.130
The only thing that's making me
sort of interested a little bit

16:40.131 --> 16:42.266
is the bloke who's had his arm
in the air for 12 years

16:42.267 --> 16:43.667
and the elephant Baba.

16:43.668 --> 16:47.771
Other than that, I don't know
what's down there for me.

16:56.347 --> 16:58.715
All right, mate.

16:58.716 --> 17:00.851
Uh...

17:00.852 --> 17:02.586
Well, I've had better holidays.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.665
All this spiritual stuff
you keep harping on out...

17:15.666 --> 17:16.700
It's not me.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.535
Why do you think
I'm interested in...

17:23.575 --> 17:25.142
But that's like
going to a brothel and saying,

17:25.143 --> 17:27.044
"Don't mind me. I'm just gonna
stand over here and watch."

17:27.045 --> 17:29.446
Either you get involved,
or you shouldn't be there.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.985
Yeah.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.721
Yeah, and tonight

17:37.722 --> 17:39.756
I had some sort of new pudding
that I've never had before...

17:39.757 --> 17:41.992
Carrots with sort of milk
and sugar on it.

17:41.993 --> 17:43.360
Enjoyed it. I'd have it again.

17:43.361 --> 17:46.763
I don't know
if I'll find it in London.

17:48.499 --> 17:51.668
In HD?

17:57.041 --> 17:59.209
This is a bit weird, isn't it?

17:59.210 --> 18:00.878
Are these the Baba people?

18:00.879 --> 18:03.480
I mean, they're meant to have
special powers, aren't they?

18:03.481 --> 18:04.848
Look at them.

18:04.849 --> 18:06.884
I mean, I thought they'd be sort
of more religious-looking.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.485
Do you know what I mean?
All prim and proper.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.387
Some of them
haven't even got pants on.

18:10.388 --> 18:14.691
We are now in an area
which is all different Babas.

18:14.692 --> 18:17.728
Ah, welcome.
You should take this lesson.

18:19.764 --> 18:24.101
First Baba...
He reminded me of Bill Oddie.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.969
His feet are backwards.

18:27.605 --> 18:28.972
Big power.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.841
Big power?
Yeah.

18:30.842 --> 18:34.211
And even though he's meant
to be this mystical sort of man,

18:34.212 --> 18:35.612
different life and everything,

18:35.613 --> 18:36.947
I'm just looking at him
thinking,

18:36.948 --> 18:41.518
"I'm seeing
the goodies for ages."

18:41.519 --> 18:45.822
And then the other Baba
looked like Jim Morrison.

18:45.823 --> 18:48.058
There he was,
stark-bollock naked,

18:48.059 --> 18:50.060
with shades on.

18:50.061 --> 18:51.995
He was concerned about
hurting his eyes in the sun

18:51.996 --> 18:53.530
but wasn't worried
about, you know...

18:53.531 --> 18:55.499
The sun burning his ass cheeks.

18:56.668 --> 19:00.003
He is showing you
some yoga postures.

19:00.004 --> 19:02.539
He's showing a lot.
Yeah.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.508
If you want to see more,
you'll have to pay.

19:04.509 --> 19:05.842
Don't want to see more.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.711
Didn't know where to look.

19:07.712 --> 19:09.246
All right, that's...
Tell him that's enough.

19:09.247 --> 19:11.348
Sticking his legs around the
back of his head and everything,

19:11.349 --> 19:12.683
I got a right eyeful.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.218
Okay.

19:15.219 --> 19:16.520
Can I try?

19:16.521 --> 19:18.689
I just wondered
how bendy my legs are.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.291
That's all I'm making off.

19:21.292 --> 19:24.227
Aah, I just heard
something crack.

19:25.596 --> 19:27.497
Right, you ready?

19:27.498 --> 19:28.999
Hang on.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.101
Hey.

19:35.273 --> 19:37.040
Aah!

19:38.409 --> 19:40.410
I can't.
Can't.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.117
Ahh!

19:47.118 --> 19:49.219
A dollar!

19:49.220 --> 19:50.654
A dollar?
Dollar.

19:50.655 --> 19:51.855
Very good.

19:51.856 --> 19:53.991
Ooh.

19:55.493 --> 19:59.262
Hey, here's that Baba
out of the paper.

19:59.263 --> 20:04.034
So, could he explain the reason
why he's decided to do this?

20:06.237 --> 20:08.071
He has chosen this

20:08.072 --> 20:10.474
as a part of his way
of communicating

20:10.475 --> 20:13.510
and his way of reaching
to the God.

20:15.947 --> 20:19.449
That, to me, is ridiculous.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.684
Most of the time,

20:20.685 --> 20:22.519
my left hand is only helping out
the right hand.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.354
It's if I'm washing up,
I'll pass it something.

20:24.355 --> 20:26.089
That's it,
or it just holds something

20:26.090 --> 20:27.724
whilst this one
does all the work.

20:27.725 --> 20:30.660
I understand that one arm
is better than the other,

20:30.661 --> 20:33.497
but I'd never say,
"Oh, but I don't need it."

20:33.498 --> 20:34.798
All right.

20:34.799 --> 20:40.537
Has anybody ever took it further
and done both arms?

20:42.306 --> 20:44.808
There are others
also who do it with one leg up,

20:44.809 --> 20:47.077
both hands up,
both the legs up,

20:47.078 --> 20:49.112
so they never stand
on their feet.

20:49.113 --> 20:51.281
Well, that's no existence,
is it?

20:51.282 --> 20:54.851
We all dedicate our lives
to something, don't we?

20:54.852 --> 20:59.556
Been with Suzanne for 16 years.
That's dedication for you.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.825
And I've got me two arms
to do things for her.

21:01.826 --> 21:04.594
Is he married? How does he help
around the house?

21:04.595 --> 21:06.730
"Albert, windows need cleaning."

21:06.731 --> 21:08.865
"Eh. You'll have to do them."

21:08.866 --> 21:10.534
You know?

21:10.535 --> 21:13.403
I mean, it's just
a great excuse, isn't it?

21:16.774 --> 21:18.275
Yeah, it was better
than I thought it was.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.510
You know, quite interesting.

21:20.511 --> 21:21.912
And I'm going back tomorrow,
aren't I,

21:21.913 --> 21:23.346
to see the elephant Baba.

21:23.347 --> 21:24.681
He's got a head
like an elephant.

21:24.682 --> 21:27.350
That should be good.

21:34.519 --> 21:37.221
I'm gonna go down to
the Kumbh Mela festival again,

21:37.222 --> 21:39.523
which is weird, isn't it?

21:39.524 --> 21:40.565
'Cause I didn't want to go
initially,

21:40.566 --> 21:42.699
but I found it
quite interesting.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.842
And the translator's called,

21:43.843 --> 21:46.443
and he's told me that he's found
the elephant Baba.

21:46.444 --> 21:47.745
Oh, yeah, I can see him.

21:47.746 --> 21:49.079
Yeah, I can see him.
You can?

21:49.080 --> 21:51.415
Yeah, here, we take shoes off.
Shoes off?

21:51.416 --> 21:53.350
Money down there?
Ohh.

21:55.086 --> 21:56.387
How is he feeling today?

21:56.388 --> 21:57.521
Is he well?

21:57.522 --> 21:58.756
Okay, good.

21:58.757 --> 22:00.224
"Okay."

22:02.394 --> 22:04.595
He doesn't mind
me looking at all?

22:04.596 --> 22:06.830
This is fine?
Yeah.

22:09.034 --> 22:12.169
And does it have any sort
of health issues with him?

22:12.170 --> 22:14.505
Does he struggle
doing anything?

22:19.411 --> 22:23.714
He's quite healthy.
He does his yoga every day.

22:23.715 --> 22:27.785
Could you get him to explain
what affect it has had

22:27.786 --> 22:30.888
on living here
and looking like this?

22:43.935 --> 22:46.036
It was how I thought
it would be,

22:46.037 --> 22:48.539
you know, meeting elephant Baba.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.441
He seems quite happy.

22:50.442 --> 22:53.944
You know, he's doing what he can
do with the way he's been born.

22:53.945 --> 22:56.914
It was his mate
that surprised me more.

22:56.915 --> 23:00.651
Whips his, uh,
walking stick out.

23:05.657 --> 23:07.891
Oh, gosh.

23:07.892 --> 23:10.494
I don't understand.
What...

23:10.495 --> 23:12.329
What does that show?

23:12.330 --> 23:15.432
He can do it just because
he does yoga every day.

23:15.433 --> 23:17.935
I've never heard
of that sort of yoga.

23:19.070 --> 23:20.838
Ohh! What was that?
There was a crack.

23:20.839 --> 23:22.406
When you're doing that
every day,

23:22.407 --> 23:24.808
that's something you need,
isn't it, the walking stick?

23:24.809 --> 23:27.611
It's handy that it's
a two-in-one tool, in a way.

23:27.612 --> 23:29.313
Well, I don't understand

23:29.314 --> 23:32.916
this need to let everyone know
what you believe in.

23:32.917 --> 23:37.488
Vandalizing his own
sort of *** and bollocks.

23:37.489 --> 23:39.390
Yeah, that was a added bonus.

23:39.391 --> 23:41.425
I didn't know I was gonna
be getting that today.

23:48.902 --> 23:51.676
Got a text message
this morning from Steve.

23:52.128 --> 23:54.263
He said, "All right, Karl,
I was worried

23:54.264 --> 23:57.566
"that you would not be able
to understand spirituality,

23:57.567 --> 23:59.334
"so I've asked a local saint

23:59.335 --> 24:02.638
"to take you to his ashram
for the night

24:02.639 --> 24:04.239
"for some one-to-one discussions

24:04.240 --> 24:06.608
"on the nature of life

24:06.609 --> 24:10.312
and higher levels
of consciousness."

24:10.313 --> 24:13.515
And apparently, I'm gonna
meet one of his disciples...

24:13.516 --> 24:14.850
A fellow called Dav Ram.

24:14.851 --> 24:18.420
Hiya.
Are you Dav Ram?

24:18.421 --> 24:20.389
America.
Dav Ram?

24:20.390 --> 24:22.324
America!

24:22.325 --> 24:24.760
What?
Are you Dav Ram?

24:24.761 --> 24:26.028
Yes, I am.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.329
What do you mean, "America"?

24:27.330 --> 24:29.197
Oh, I thought you said
where did I come from?

24:29.198 --> 24:30.499
Yes, my name is Dav Ram.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.100
Dav Ram. Okay, brilliant.
Yeah.

24:35.905 --> 24:40.342
You're gonna meet, really, one
of the great saints of India.

24:40.343 --> 24:43.946
The Swamiji has reached the
height of spiritual development.

24:43.947 --> 24:48.784
Just being in the presence
of a master of that caliber

24:48.785 --> 24:52.054
elevates one's awareness.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.089
And will he keep asking me
if I'm feeling that?

24:54.090 --> 24:56.692
No. No.
No?

24:56.693 --> 25:00.262
I'm trying to think
of times in me life

25:00.263 --> 25:01.763
where I've felt
a bit different.

25:01.764 --> 25:03.298
Right.

25:03.299 --> 25:06.635
And I remember...
it was years ago...

25:06.636 --> 25:08.603
I nearly choked to death.

25:08.604 --> 25:10.105
Hmm?

25:10.106 --> 25:11.506
On an ice pop.

25:11.507 --> 25:13.742
Hmm.

25:13.743 --> 25:15.777
And me mom had to give me...
Do you know the thing

25:15.778 --> 25:18.780
where you squeeze around the
waist and sort of cough it up?

25:18.781 --> 25:20.015
Right.

25:20.016 --> 25:21.383
And I got me breath back.
Uh-huh.

25:21.384 --> 25:25.287
And after that,
I felt quite, uh...

25:25.288 --> 25:28.256
Alive.

25:28.257 --> 25:29.858
Okay, well,
take that experience,

25:29.859 --> 25:32.394
magnify it manyfold,

25:32.395 --> 25:34.930
and let it be uninterrupted.

25:34.931 --> 25:37.299
Hey.
How are you, Swamiji?

25:39.635 --> 25:41.870
That's good.

25:41.871 --> 25:43.238
I've been better.

25:51.180 --> 25:52.781
I'd say mind.

26:01.524 --> 26:03.658
Hmm.

26:03.659 --> 26:07.396
Anyway, next thing you know,
Swamiji says,

26:07.397 --> 26:09.831
"I want to take you
across the Ganges in a boat."

26:09.832 --> 26:11.933
'Cause he wanted to cleanse
me soul or something.

26:11.934 --> 26:13.869
I've never
had it cleansed before.

26:13.870 --> 26:16.438
Hey, look, look. He's gone down.
He's having a dunk.

26:21.411 --> 26:22.911
I'm not dipping there.

26:22.912 --> 26:24.212
No chance.

26:24.213 --> 26:25.514
Not a chance.

26:33.189 --> 26:35.457
You all right, Swami?

26:36.759 --> 26:39.127
Oh shit. Hang on.

26:39.128 --> 26:41.430
Hello?

26:41.431 --> 26:44.066
I'm just in the Ganges
at the moment.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.868
Just on a rubber dinghy
with a 70-year-old man.

26:49.305 --> 26:52.107
So it's not a great...

26:52.108 --> 26:54.209
I'm sat on the front here
of a rubber dinghy.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.912
Can I call you back in a bit?

26:56.913 --> 26:58.280
I'll see you later. Ta-ra.

27:00.216 --> 27:01.583
Time to call, isn't it?

27:05.288 --> 27:07.189
Don't know.
Isn't it wrong, though?

27:07.190 --> 27:08.824
For me to get in there?

27:08.825 --> 27:11.526
It doesn't mean anything to me.
It doesn't count, surely.

27:11.527 --> 27:13.829
He said, "Do you want to go
in the Ganges?"

27:13.830 --> 27:14.963
I said, "No."

27:16.699 --> 27:18.400
Yeah?
Yeah.

27:21.437 --> 27:24.506
And he left it at that,
which I thought was quite good.

27:24.507 --> 27:27.008
He didn't force it on me
to go any further.

27:27.009 --> 27:31.179
And then he started
stripping off, and so I had to.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.814
This is madness.

27:38.788 --> 27:40.455
Come on.
Hey?

27:53.402 --> 27:55.704
And I said,
"Well, if you go in, I'll go in."

27:55.705 --> 27:57.005
And he did.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.842
So I had to.

28:00.843 --> 28:03.612
Ohh!

28:05.448 --> 28:07.782
Bloody hell.

28:07.783 --> 28:09.751
And, uh, I thought that was it,
and then suddenly,

28:09.752 --> 28:11.453
he's like,
"All right, let's dunk your head."

28:13.089 --> 28:14.723
Yeah. Right.

28:14.724 --> 28:16.958
You know, and not once, either.

28:16.959 --> 28:18.226
You have to do it
three times, eh?

28:18.227 --> 28:19.694
Three dunks.

28:19.695 --> 28:22.430
I mean, you don't do that with
a ginger nut in a cup of tea.

28:22.431 --> 28:23.732
That's a two-dunk.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.735
Yeah! Yeah.

28:29.906 --> 28:31.806
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

28:31.807 --> 28:34.176
So, do that...

28:34.177 --> 28:36.244
He's happy.

28:36.245 --> 28:37.946
And he was saying,
"Oh, look what it's done to you.

28:37.947 --> 28:39.447
You look full of life."

28:39.448 --> 28:44.252
And it did wake me up a bit,
but it is, like, minus 5.

28:51.561 --> 28:53.361
Back for a cup of tea?

28:53.362 --> 28:55.597
Have you got some biscuits?
Yeah.

28:55.598 --> 28:57.098
I'd love a biscuit.
Yeah.

28:57.099 --> 28:58.967
I feel like I can take
a biscuit off you now.

28:58.968 --> 29:00.936
I did that for you.

29:02.672 --> 29:05.006
It's funny, isn't it?

29:05.007 --> 29:07.809
Funny how things change.
I said I wouldn't get in there.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.316
I don't feel like I'm around
some sort of special power,

29:14.317 --> 29:17.219
but he seems like a nice bloke.
And that's all you want, really.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.654
Nice bloke, makes you feel
welcome in his gaff.

29:19.655 --> 29:21.723
He's fed us.
He's let me have a bed.

29:21.724 --> 29:23.325
Messed about
in his rubber dinghy.

29:23.326 --> 29:26.261
You know, if that's
what spirituality's about,

29:26.262 --> 29:28.163
then that's just
being mates, really.

29:28.164 --> 29:29.898
That's basic, isn't it?

29:29.899 --> 29:32.200
It's just about getting on
with people.

29:34.170 --> 29:37.038
He's a transformed man.
Look at this guy.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.406
It's very airy.

29:44.714 --> 29:46.214
See you in the morning.
Okay.

29:51.621 --> 29:53.188
Thanks. See you again.

30:29.592 --> 30:32.560
I don't know
why Steve sent me to a cow.

30:32.561 --> 30:34.029
We've got them at home.

30:34.030 --> 30:37.432
Anyway, as soon I got in there,
they had me on cow-worship duty.

30:37.433 --> 30:40.068
I'm giving it a sense of party.

30:43.639 --> 30:46.808
Cow-dung cake?
Yes.

30:46.809 --> 30:48.343
Is that fresh?
Yeah, this is fresh.

30:48.344 --> 30:51.646
Anyway, these cow-dung cakes...
you know, it's a type of fuel.

30:51.647 --> 30:54.015
You know, it shouldn't really
have the word "cake" in it.

30:58.187 --> 30:59.387
Hey, this is swell, isn't it?

30:59.388 --> 31:01.022
I thought it might have
just been mud,

31:01.023 --> 31:02.324
but it is proper cow shit.

31:02.325 --> 31:04.159
And I was worried
about the local thing

31:04.160 --> 31:07.896
about, you know, using your hand
when you've been to the toilet.

31:07.897 --> 31:11.466
I'm getting neck high
in cow shit.

31:11.467 --> 31:15.136
My God. I never thought
I'd be doing that.

31:15.137 --> 31:17.339
I've been ill twice already,

31:17.340 --> 31:20.008
so this isn't gonna
help the situation, is it?

31:20.009 --> 31:22.977
I thought I was on the way
to the Taj Mahal today.

31:22.978 --> 31:25.547
He said,
"Oh, let's stop over here."

31:25.548 --> 31:27.015
"Not a problem.

31:27.016 --> 31:28.950
"I'll see some cows.

31:28.951 --> 31:30.618
What can go wrong?"

31:30.619 --> 31:32.287
And then, like,
just as I'm leaving, you know,

31:32.288 --> 31:34.155
I'm thinking
I'm getting out of there,

31:34.156 --> 31:35.623
they drug me into some sort
of souvenir shop.

31:35.624 --> 31:37.292
- Soap?
- Yeah.

31:39.395 --> 31:40.829
Cow-dung juice?
Juice. Yeah.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.597
No one I know
has ever been rushing around,

31:42.598 --> 31:44.666
going into body shops, saying,
"You haven't got any cow shit,

31:44.667 --> 31:46.000
have you? Cow shit soap?"

31:46.001 --> 31:48.503
It's not needed.
<i>So</i> not necessary in life.

31:50.139 --> 31:53.742
Not toothpaste, but powder?
And what's this made from?

31:56.545 --> 31:57.879
You can still like the cow

31:57.880 --> 32:01.883
without going that far
with the shit and the piss.

32:03.452 --> 32:06.187
Over me arm, then.
Ohh! God!

32:06.188 --> 32:07.889
It was just like old-man piss...

32:07.890 --> 32:11.159
Sort of when your granddad's
been and hasn't flushed.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.560
And you drink that?

32:15.531 --> 32:16.898
It cures baldness?
Yeah.

32:16.899 --> 32:22.036
Come all the way to India,
sticking cow shit on my head.

32:22.037 --> 32:24.339
If I said,
"Get stuff out of a chicken

32:24.340 --> 32:26.207
and rub it over your head,"
they'd go, "Don't be stupid."

32:26.208 --> 32:27.609
Well, it's because it's a cow

32:27.610 --> 32:29.677
and it's this sort of
religious animal...

32:29.678 --> 32:31.246
It's just, "Yeah, drink it.

32:31.247 --> 32:33.481
Straight, direct.
Get the tail up."

32:33.482 --> 32:35.583
It's just too much.

32:35.584 --> 32:38.386
I think it's...
It annoyed me a bit.

32:39.722 --> 32:42.357
I've still got bits
under me nails.

32:44.050 --> 32:45.857
Oh, it's starting
to do me head in again.

32:46.382 --> 32:50.271
Just, you know...
Even with that traveling today.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.603
Normally, I like
traveling around, sat in a car,

32:52.604 --> 32:54.371
looking out of a window,
looking at life going on.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.174
But it's not a nice thing to do
in India.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.576
Honestly,
I just want to go home.

32:59.577 --> 33:00.944
Oh, Jesus.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.446
It stinks.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.181
Me eyes are burning.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.408
This is the hotel?
Yeah, this is the hotel.

33:31.409 --> 33:32.909
This one?
Yeah.

33:32.910 --> 33:35.212
This is very romantic.

33:35.213 --> 33:38.482
This hotel's got
a honeymoon suite?

33:42.086 --> 33:45.322
Pilkington.
Honeymoon suite.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.129
Good.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.335
That's good.

33:58.336 --> 34:01.571
Honeymoon suite.
This isn't a honeymoon suite.

34:01.572 --> 34:04.608
Who would have a honeymoon here?

34:04.609 --> 34:06.610
What's that there?
What's the cupboard for?

34:06.611 --> 34:08.178
All right.

34:08.179 --> 34:12.949
Sort of an en suite shed,
which is quite handy.

34:12.949 --> 34:15.452
Oh, God, it stinks.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.154
Fuck me.
What a shit hole.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.322
Sandpaper.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.561
What's this one... a dartboard?

34:24.562 --> 34:25.795
Hmm.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.399
I thought that was gonna
be the fridge to the room.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.869
Turps, paint brushes. Good.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.739
That's what you want on your
honeymoon, isn't it, really?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.440
Every time
you have a smell of ronseal,

34:37.442 --> 34:39.409
"Oh, that takes me back
to our special night."

34:45.382 --> 34:46.949
I can't see the Taj.

34:46.951 --> 34:50.320
He said
if you look straight out there.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.126
That's what you can see. That.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.563
It's madness that that body's

34:59.564 --> 35:02.032
staying in somewhere half-decent
like that...

35:02.033 --> 35:03.433
And I'm in here.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.302
I hate it, honestly.

35:05.303 --> 35:09.172
I really hate it here.

35:09.173 --> 35:11.007
Fuck this.
I'm not staying here.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.510
Can't be hassled with this.

35:13.511 --> 35:14.911
Karl, where you going?

35:14.912 --> 35:17.414
Karl! Karl!

35:17.415 --> 35:19.182
Karl, where you going, mate?

35:19.183 --> 35:22.586
Fucking that, I just...
I'm not staying in that room.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.654
What's it about?

35:24.655 --> 35:27.157
Well, I don't think anyone
knew it was quite this bad.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.692
I mean, your room's
not that bad.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.228
It stinks of shit,

35:31.229 --> 35:34.464
what do you mean,
"It's not that bad"?

35:34.465 --> 35:37.701
It fucking stinks.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.478
It's just that I've been here
for, like, ages.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.480
I'm knackered.
I haven't slept.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.582
It's another noisy road.
I've been ill.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.718
Do you know what I mean?
It's not your fault.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.686
All right.
It's not your fault.

36:16.104 --> 36:18.750
I bet many a bloke's spent
a night in here on their own,

36:19.329 --> 36:20.996
even though
it's a honeymoon suite.

36:20.997 --> 36:24.199
I bet the woman says,
"That's it. It's over.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.168
"If this is where you bring me
for me wedding night,

36:26.169 --> 36:28.370
forget it."

36:43.749 --> 36:44.886
6:00 in the morning.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.838
I've been awake all night,
throwing up.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.373
It's been coming out
the other end.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.710
I'm not feeling me best,
to be honest.

36:57.417 --> 36:58.823
So, this is
your first proper glimpse

36:59.134 --> 37:00.635
of the Taj Mahal, Karl.

37:00.636 --> 37:01.749
How's it feel?

37:03.906 --> 37:04.975
It's all right, isn't it?

37:06.141 --> 37:08.443
It's not bad.

37:08.444 --> 37:12.054
It took 20 years to build.
He built it for his dead wife.

37:12.334 --> 37:14.694
I just think it was a case
of keeping himself busy.

37:15.203 --> 37:16.537
They say that, don't they?

37:16.538 --> 37:19.306
When someone dies,
it's a loss in your life,

37:19.307 --> 37:21.005
so give yourself
a little project to do.

37:23.298 --> 37:25.066
It's a quite a big project,
though, isn't it?

37:27.135 --> 37:28.602
Yeah.

37:28.603 --> 37:31.973
I mean, did he treat her well
when she was knocking around?

37:31.974 --> 37:34.542
Well, she was
one of four wives.

37:34.543 --> 37:37.144
You know what I mean?

37:37.145 --> 37:38.713
One of four wives.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.414
"You know,
I had three other wives.

37:40.415 --> 37:42.316
"I shouldn't have done that,
really.

37:42.317 --> 37:43.884
Best stick her
in something nice."

37:43.885 --> 37:46.187
Now she's dead. It's too late.
It's too late, mate.

37:46.188 --> 37:48.889
Don't come crawling back
once she's dead.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.025
Ramesh?
Hiya. I'm Karl.

38:06.026 --> 38:07.459
Nice to meet you, sir.

38:07.460 --> 38:08.627
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

38:08.628 --> 38:10.062
Thank you very much.

38:10.063 --> 38:12.064
When you look at the Taj Mahal
from the next arch...

38:12.065 --> 38:13.766
Like a Taj Mahal in a frame.

38:13.767 --> 38:17.169
Beautiful like
the postcard view.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.872
Yeah, it works well, doesn't it?
Nicely fits in, doesn't it?

38:19.873 --> 38:22.841
Yes.
Your dream come true.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.544
You're in front of this
beautiful building, majestic.

38:25.545 --> 38:28.280
Is this part of your tour?
Yeah.

38:28.281 --> 38:31.517
There you can see a beautiful
reflection view of Taj Mahal.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.353
Like a "Buy one, get one free."

38:34.354 --> 38:36.422
"Buy one, get one free"?
Good offer.

38:36.423 --> 38:38.691
Next step?

38:38.692 --> 38:41.193
Sir, you can see
the Princess Diana chair.

38:41.194 --> 38:44.863
When it was 1992, she came here.
She took the pose from here.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.636
Yeah, well, the tourists all
love the Princess Diana chair,

38:50.637 --> 38:52.605
queuing up to sit down
on the chair

38:52.606 --> 38:54.573
that Princess Diana sat on...

38:54.574 --> 38:57.376
Load of nonsense.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.744
We're after these two, right?

38:58.745 --> 39:00.746
Yes, sir. That's your turn.
All right.

39:00.747 --> 39:03.048
"Just a sausage factory.
Sit down, look miserable."

39:03.049 --> 39:04.550
"Next."

39:04.551 --> 39:06.352
Yes. Hands on the knees.

39:06.353 --> 39:09.755
That's the style.

39:09.756 --> 39:11.890
Very nice.
Was that good?

39:11.891 --> 39:13.993
You have a photogenic face.

39:13.994 --> 39:17.162
The Taj Mahal is beautiful.
You are more handsome.

39:17.163 --> 39:19.798
You got any feelings coming up?

39:19.799 --> 39:23.469
Uh, stomach's better now.
It's fine.

39:23.470 --> 39:26.005
I meant more of an
emotional nature, being here.

39:26.006 --> 39:29.008
Um, how can you have
an emotional feeling here?

39:29.009 --> 39:31.543
There's like 40 people
stood around.

39:31.544 --> 39:33.078
Princess Diana
had it closed off, didn't she?

39:33.079 --> 39:37.983
She could sit here
and think about stuff.

39:37.984 --> 39:41.820
But compared to out there,
this is peaceful,

39:41.821 --> 39:43.555
and I think
that's why Diana came here.

39:43.556 --> 39:44.790
That's why she looked fed up.

39:44.791 --> 39:46.558
She was probably
out shit for two days,

39:46.559 --> 39:48.494
sick of the racket, crap hotel.

39:48.495 --> 39:50.229
She's like,
"God, when am I going home?"

39:50.230 --> 39:51.930
Nothing to do
with her marriage breakup.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.432
It's India.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.801
The main white structure...

39:55.802 --> 39:57.369
four sides symmetrical.

39:57.370 --> 39:58.837
Look from all sides...
same view.

39:58.838 --> 40:00.172
All right.

40:00.173 --> 40:01.573
So by the center line,

40:01.574 --> 40:03.642
Taj Mahal divides
like a mirror image,

40:03.643 --> 40:05.678
half this side,
half other side.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.713
Isn't it? Exactly?
Yes, sir.

40:07.714 --> 40:10.182
I find it odd, to be honest.

40:10.183 --> 40:11.917
It's built for a dead person,

40:11.918 --> 40:14.787
yet he was doing
all that symmetrical stuff.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.823
He's like, "Hang on a minute."

40:17.824 --> 40:20.893
It's almost like having a
gravestone with a sudoku on it.

40:20.894 --> 40:22.428
What is it?
Is it a place

40:22.429 --> 40:24.363
to sort of remember someone,
have a special moment,

40:24.364 --> 40:26.532
or is it a place
to go and have a puzzle?

40:26.533 --> 40:28.467
It's like that thing...
Have you ever done that thing

40:28.468 --> 40:30.602
where you have a mirror and
you go like that in the mirror?

40:30.603 --> 40:31.970
Yeah.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.673
And it looks like
both sides are going up.

40:34.674 --> 40:36.508
It's the same idea.
Same idea.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.620
This is best way to see it
for me, this.

40:48.621 --> 40:50.756
It's not the best river
I've ever been down.

40:50.757 --> 40:52.858
I think I've just seen
a fish with three heads.

40:52.859 --> 40:55.427
But I just like
the peacefulness.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.666
All right?

41:00.667 --> 41:03.535
Yeah, I've just been
to see the Taj.

41:03.536 --> 41:08.107
Eh, it's all right, you know.
I was pretty impressed.

41:09.909 --> 41:11.276
I hate it.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.216
I stayed at a place
that had an en suite shed.

41:17.217 --> 41:18.784
Did he stay <i>there?</i>

41:28.461 --> 41:30.763
And this is like
the final view of it, isn't it,

41:30.764 --> 41:32.564
before I go home.

41:36.403 --> 41:38.470
All right, mate, how's it going?

41:41.241 --> 41:42.875
It's been interesting, Steve.
I've learned a lot.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.810
I've seen a lot.
I've done a lot.

41:44.811 --> 41:46.145
I've shat a lot.

41:49.783 --> 41:52.384
I mean, just over there,
they cremate bodies over there,

41:52.385 --> 41:55.721
so you're never that far away
from that weirdness in India,

41:55.722 --> 41:57.156
even here.

41:57.157 --> 41:59.124
Probably on the telly, you're
going, "That looks lovely."

41:59.125 --> 42:01.460
Wildlife going on there,

42:01.461 --> 42:03.362
the sun going down,
the Taj Mahal.

42:03.363 --> 42:05.597
Hang on. What's that? There's a
lot of dead bodies out the back.

42:17.644 --> 42:19.344
Definitely not.

42:23.116 --> 42:25.651
This has been
the only building in India

42:25.652 --> 42:28.086
that has a bit
of normality to it,

42:28.087 --> 42:30.055
so maybe
that's why it's a wonder.

42:31.424 --> 42:35.794
Yeah, I can't see anything much
in this one, to be honest.

42:37.664 --> 42:39.960
Pretty serious for me,
that, isn't it?
