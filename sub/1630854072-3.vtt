WEBVTT

01:43.770 --> 01:45.021
What are we gonna do with it, huh?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.482
Oh, this Sandy is mine.
Always has been.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.234
Why is this one began to chipped?

01:49.317 --> 01:52.153
Uninstalling it
is gonna cost us, so are you ready?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.030
Ugh. It'll spike us shit.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.366
He's a massive pain in my ass.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.326
How about we flat-line them?

01:58.409 --> 02:01.704
The five Fingers can have discount
on work created on his cold dead body.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.206
We still need a reaper for that.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.041
But we'd breakeven, wouldn't we?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.501
Sure, barely. I suppose.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.380
You hear that? I should just
rip the damn thing off myself.

02:10.463 --> 02:14.300
Maybe then you'd finally learn not to
clap-shit that ain't yours, piss sniffer.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.553
Please don't get blood all over my room,

02:16.636 --> 02:17.679
-all right?
-Stay out of this!

02:17.762 --> 02:20.515
Um, excuse me?
I was the one who found him.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.683
Grr.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.353
-You fucking lied to me?
-Shut up!

02:25.436 --> 02:28.731
Now, spill it. What the fuck you're doing
and parading around on my throne?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.191
Yours?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.360
You bet your ass. That's right.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.822
Bought and paid for it. Except my supplier
ghosted once I put down.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.949
So, what'd you get for paying in advance?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.951
-I can't move.
-Shut it!

02:40.034 --> 02:44.414
She's got people. One of our own.
Just looking to make some fast scratch.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.207
She'd been curved for it too. Up to now.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.208
Hold on.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.711
-Huh?
-Your supplier. You mean…

02:49.794 --> 02:53.506
Gloria Martinez. That ring a bell?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.216
Oh, yeah. She's my mom.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.426
Huh?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.386
So, you're Gloria's brat?

02:58.469 --> 03:00.346
Why did she think you can handle
an offer with you?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.848
She didn't. She died.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.391
Huh?

03:03.474 --> 03:04.434
Yesterday.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.229
What the fuck?
But I just talked to her two days ago.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.732
What happened?
The bad just killed get her, or--

03:10.815 --> 03:12.567
It was a car accident.

03:12.650 --> 03:16.237
From some kind of gang group drive-by…
Got caught in the crossfire.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.823
Nothing to do with the Sandevistan.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.534
Hmm.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.494
Hmm.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.706
Tracks why she never bought us back.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.500
Condolences, kid. That's tough, but still…

03:30.501 --> 03:33.755
Don't paid for a set
that makes things free and easy for you.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.007
Listen. I had no idea it was yours.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.717
Yeah, I've never been an escort

03:37.800 --> 03:40.261
chipping all the mails spectrum
my mom left lying around.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.930
Good times, good times.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.224
Christ! This twerp's
clearly got a screw lose!

03:44.307 --> 03:46.517
Back off. He didn't know
what he was doing.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.521
You guys… are cyberpunks, aren't you?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.153
What's it to you?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.572
Let me keep the Sandy.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.116
Can't pay you back just now,
but I'll work it off.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.786
One gig at a time, long as it takes.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.872
Not good enough.
Shit's a military-grade.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.375
You can't just buy another off the shelf.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.710
Whatever you paid my mom,
I'll get it back.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.045
No deal.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.964
I said, no murder.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.424
Come on! Just give me a chance!

04:18.508 --> 04:21.469
Now that's funny.
I look like I run a preschool to you?

04:21.552 --> 04:23.429
I'll fire up the Sandevistan.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.517
Bullshit. Totally like you can't
boot it up without keeling over.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.435
This toddler's full of surprises.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.812
-Hmm?
-Hmm? No.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.189
Body his size
would sizzle up after two hits.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.816
Tried eight. No sizzle.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.109
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

04:36.192 --> 04:38.945
Come on. That's a lot of bunk
and we all know it.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.573
Yeah? Okay. Then how about I prove it?

04:43.157 --> 04:45.576
Whoa. Plant your ass back down.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.538
Yo! Chill out.
Just gonna clap this cig real quick.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.581
That's in up my sleeve… See?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.624
Wha--? Huh?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.920
-Aah!
-That makes nine today…

04:56.004 --> 04:57.964
No way. It's actually ten.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.050
Holy shit! What in the
fast forward fuck was that?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.260
Just give me a chance.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.971
A chance, huh? What kind?

05:05.596 --> 05:07.598
Easy. You take me out on a job.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.726
Won't fuck it up.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.948
Got quite a pay on you.
I'll give you that.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.908
Okay, kid. You get one chance.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.577
Oh, great. Here we go again.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.372
I owe it to Gloria, and maybe
the apple don't fall far. Hmm?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.582
You won't regret it.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.959
-Huh? He-- Hey!
-Chill.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.544
Just slotting a tracker.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.172
Wouldn't want you go on AWOL on us.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.548
I ain't gonna run.

05:40.631 --> 05:44.177
Yeah, yeah. I heard
that one before. A lot of times.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.262
Be hearing from me tomorrow.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.563
So, cyberpunks. Those were
the kind of peeps you roll with.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.608
Mm-hm.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.611
-Could've said some--
-Like what?

06:01.694 --> 06:04.197
Seems like a plan from the start.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.075
Maine wouldn't shut up about
this priced Sandy going missing

06:07.158 --> 06:09.994
and I saw you using
an exact same one in this train.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.039
Knew for sure you had his
after the visit to your reaper.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.084
Then thought you'd bat your eyes
at me till they showed.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.669
You're lying the whole time.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.505
Just go home already.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.173
Yeah.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.554
About your mom…

06:29.222 --> 06:30.807
Sorry for your loss.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.671
<i>Mr. Martinez,</i>

07:01.754 --> 07:06.467
<i>wonderful news. Based on your</i>
<i>exemplary academic performance,</i>

07:06.551 --> 07:09.470
<i>the Arasaka Corporation</i>
<i>has awarded you a scholarship</i>

07:09.554 --> 07:12.598
<i>so that you may return to your studies.</i>

07:12.682 --> 07:16.727
<i>This is an exceptionally rare opportunity</i>

07:16.811 --> 07:19.230
<i>and a great honor. Congratulations.</i>

07:19.313 --> 07:20.690
<i>However,</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:23.568
<i>there is still the matter</i>
<i>of your recent violent behavior</i>

07:23.651 --> 07:26.696
<i>regarding Mr. Tanaka on Academy grounds.</i>

07:26.779 --> 07:28.865
<i>Now, I spoke with Mr. Tanaka</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:31.576
<i>and he has graciously agreed</i>

07:31.659 --> 07:34.454
<i>to strike several demerits</i>
<i>from your permanent record</i>

07:34.537 --> 07:36.664
<i>should you offer an apology.</i>

07:36.747 --> 07:38.416
<i>For details, please--</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:42.879
Hmm?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.755
<i>Kid, you're up.</i>

07:54.974 --> 07:57.310
Hey! Over here, kid.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.315
Morning, sunshine. You ready?

08:02.398 --> 08:04.692
The data wasn't lying.
He is just a kid.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.903
-Can he keep up?
-Guess we'll see.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.822
Now I know.
I know he's a sweet little thing,

08:09.906 --> 08:11.949
but keep those grabbing myths to yourself.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.577
Why do we even put up with you?

08:15.244 --> 08:19.123
This one here is Kiwi.
And Dorio and Pilar, you've met.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.541
Make yourself comfy.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.669
-My name is David--
-Too fast.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.005
Let's get right down to biz, kid.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.882
Slot the shard.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.307
<i>Say hello to Arasaka Corporation's</i>
<i>driver and bodyguard…</i>

08:36.390 --> 08:38.017
-<i>Maxim.</i>
-<i>Yeah!</i>

08:38.100 --> 08:41.646
<i>We're gonna swipe the nav data</i>
<i>from the limo he rolls around the area.</i>

08:41.729 --> 08:44.190
<i>Just the data? Not the car?</i>

08:44.273 --> 08:45.358
<i>We clap the ride</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:48.277
<i>and Arasaka's ninjas</i>
<i>will swarm us like flies to shit.</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:50.488
<i>So, yeah, just the data.</i>

08:50.571 --> 08:51.697
<i>How?</i>

08:51.781 --> 08:55.201
<i>Betting on fights</i>
<i>is this lad here's sole joy in life.</i>

08:55.284 --> 08:57.745
<i>He's in one of those seats every weekend.</i>

08:59.038 --> 09:01.582
<i>He always put a bag</i>
<i>stack on Butcher,</i>

09:01.666 --> 09:04.168
<i>bank them on its cold,</i>
<i>splitting, upper cutters.</i>

09:06.295 --> 09:09.590
<i>From hearing alone,</i>
<i>most peeps show up just to see her</i>

09:09.674 --> 09:12.760
<i>paint the cage red</i>
<i>with some poor gut's blood.</i>

09:13.594 --> 09:14.595
<i>Except…</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:22.687
<i>this weekend,</i>
<i>ain't gonna go down like that,</i>

09:22.770 --> 09:27.316
<i>the Butcher's getting butchered</i>
<i>in round one, like a sad sack of meat.</i>

09:34.407 --> 09:35.700
<i>What makes you so sure?</i>

09:35.783 --> 09:38.202
<i>Just trust me on that.</i>

09:41.914 --> 09:43.124
<i>Anyway,</i>

09:43.207 --> 09:46.335
<i>he had a habit of drowning the sorrows</i>
<i>at this one hole in a wall dive.</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:50.840
<i>And that's where you make your move,</i>
<i>few drinks in when he's getting greased.</i>

09:57.179 --> 09:59.640
<i>You nab the key and hand it to Dorio.</i>

10:00.182 --> 10:02.476
<i>She'll photocopy the pop block.</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:07.148
<i>Then we clap the nav data while</i>
<i>sack-of-muscle Max was still shit-faced.</i>

10:08.316 --> 10:09.942
<i>But leave that to us,</i>

10:10.026 --> 10:13.154
<i>you just got to slip the key back</i>
<i>in the slot before he catches on.</i>

10:13.821 --> 10:15.823
<i>That's it. Simple.</i>

10:17.074 --> 10:17.950
<i>Hold on…</i>

10:18.034 --> 10:19.827
<i>His master's calling.</i>

10:19.910 --> 10:24.248
<i>Sheesh, bastard can't catch</i>
<i>a break. No rest for the wicked.</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:25.666
<i>Not good.</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:28.252
-<i>His boss needs him there.</i>
-<i>Shit, on his day off?</i>

10:28.336 --> 10:29.754
<i>Data's not copied yet!</i>

10:29.837 --> 10:32.465
<i>Fuck! Change of plans, kid.</i>

10:32.548 --> 10:34.383
<i>Key to the car. Grab it.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.136
<i>Becca, trip him up.</i>

10:37.219 --> 10:39.430
-Huh?
-<i>Chop chop, go!</i>

10:42.141 --> 10:44.185
-Aah!
-Hey! What the fuck?

10:44.268 --> 10:47.897
-I'm so clumsy. Sorry!
-Watch it, kid! Ooh!

10:49.231 --> 10:52.026
<i>Get in. Nab the data</i>
<i>before he shows.</i>

10:52.860 --> 10:53.861
How in the hell?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.780
I'll handle that.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.281
You get in.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.286
Ahh…

11:05.539 --> 11:07.750
Man…

11:08.501 --> 11:09.418
You good?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.670
Don't talk. Focusing.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.674
Arasaka eyes was such
a huge pain in the ass.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.134
Sorry about that, handsome!

11:17.218 --> 11:20.054
Nah. It's no problem, sweetheart.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.098
I'll make it up to you next time. Okay?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.475
Oh?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.602
-You, bitch!
-Why are you yelling at me?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.938
You're so sensitive, you know!

11:29.021 --> 11:30.898
<i>We're blown. Target coming in hot.</i>

11:30.981 --> 11:32.817
-<i>Stats?</i>
-Just a little more.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.235
<i>Time's up. Cut it!</i>

11:34.318 --> 11:36.070
Almost…

11:36.153 --> 11:37.571
Ahh. Done.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.198
It won't open!

11:39.281 --> 11:41.117
The security's back online?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.202
<i>Like I said, time's up.</i>

11:43.285 --> 11:46.163
Open up! Now! You, fuck!

11:46.831 --> 11:49.291
Oh, shit. No way back.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.501
-Start her up.
-<i>What?</i>

11:50.584 --> 11:51.752
<i>Punch it, kid.</i>

11:51.836 --> 11:53.754
I don't know how to drive!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.881
<i>Time to work.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:58.384
Hey! Hey!

11:58.467 --> 12:00.720
Get out! I said!

12:00.803 --> 12:02.763
-<i>Show me…</i>
-You're dead meat!

12:02.847 --> 12:04.306
<i>…you got what it takes.</i>

12:04.390 --> 12:05.975
You hear me?

12:06.058 --> 12:10.396
I'll make you and your whole family pay!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.691
Hey! Stop! My car!

12:20.156 --> 12:23.576
Wait! I said, wait!

12:26.036 --> 12:28.247
<i>Sure glad them ain't my wheels.</i>

12:28.330 --> 12:31.792
<i>Take it straight to Aldo's.</i>
<i>You hash the GPS?</i>

12:31.876 --> 12:34.295
Can't from inside. Got a jammer up,

12:34.378 --> 12:37.631
but encryption's shaky.
They'll snatch our position soon,

12:37.715 --> 12:39.550
unless we find solid cover.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.345
<i>Then Aldo's it is.</i>
<i>Should be safe there. On our way.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.389
<i>Ah, fuck, communications cutting out.</i>

12:45.473 --> 12:46.515
-Do I pull over?
-<i>No!</i>

12:46.599 --> 12:50.186
<i>Geo stats ping you,</i>
<i>they'll drop a hit squad on your ass.</i>

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
<i>Drive like hell!</i>

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
-Summing a route.
-Thank you.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.445
-You think we can make it?
-It's up to you now.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.575
Look at you. You're practically a pro.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.701
You think so?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.120
I mean, maybe if autopilot wasn't on.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.830
Whatever.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.040
We've got company.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.625
Huh?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.835
Tyger Claws?

13:16.212 --> 13:19.507
Maxim must've
provide them with a new ride.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.092
-That fast?
-Best if we don't fuck with corpos.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.386
Make up the advantage down here on bikes.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.888
Get the highway here.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.683
Why are you running?

13:29.767 --> 13:30.851
Come backand fight, cowards!

13:30.935 --> 13:34.647
Where are you going?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.565
Gotta lose these guys.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.651
Shit. Traffic?

13:38.734 --> 13:40.110
Oh, my, my…

13:40.736 --> 13:42.404
Not good.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.171
Uh… Closing in on us.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.673
Slow-ass!

14:02.758 --> 14:05.177
-Put your buckle up!
-Huh?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.525
How dare you do that to my partner!

14:33.205 --> 14:35.583
Don't underestimate me!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.071
Seems shut-tied.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.781
Aldo should be inside.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.618
Well, at least the jammer
is still running stable.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.621
The doors weren't locked?

15:13.704 --> 15:16.248
Then unlocked for a while.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.334
Stay here. I'll scoop it out.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.806
Come on now, don't run away.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.392
Let's play a little more!

15:57.706 --> 15:58.749
Die!

16:01.627 --> 16:04.254
Die!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.124
Ew…

16:41.000 --> 16:44.378
Ugh!

16:46.422 --> 16:47.631
Sorry for the wait.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.142
Yee-ha!

16:58.225 --> 17:01.895
Yeah!

17:02.479 --> 17:05.607
Well, gotta say not bad for wookie-wookie.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.109
So, we're cool now?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.319
Sure. Welcome to the crew.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.531
But remember, little man.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.535
Ain't no one in this world
you can trust more than yourself.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.583
Start using us as your crutch,
and you're good as dead.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.876
Mm-hm.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.127
Yeah, got you.

17:27.880 --> 17:33.177
Yee-ha!

17:33.260 --> 17:36.180
Check out the precision, dudes!
Fastest thing, isn't it?

17:36.263 --> 17:38.807
I know the only thing that hurts
fastest in the west.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.812
Spit it! Devoted, you say?

17:45.397 --> 17:48.609
All hands on me!
You wanna take up for a test drive?

17:50.861 --> 17:51.904
Thanks.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.284
Immunoblockers.
Enough to get you through a month.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.453
And…

17:59.536 --> 18:01.246
Here's your cut.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.581
Holy shit!

18:02.664 --> 18:06.085
Everybody gets a fair shake.
Only where I operate.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.963
-You still mostly organic?
-Huh?

18:10.047 --> 18:13.300
Save some heads,
then look in to open your cyberware.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.845
Mere bone can't keep page
with the Sandevistan for long.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.180
You've got a point.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.643
Little more chrome and you could've zeroed
that Tyger Claw no prop,

18:22.726 --> 18:24.603
or any goon out there.

18:27.815 --> 18:32.361
It ain't waste of 'ennies if it makes you
stronger. That applies to your cyberware.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.612
And also,

18:33.695 --> 18:34.947
to your crew.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.282
Yeah, alright.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.620
Oh.

18:49.837 --> 18:50.921
Shit…

18:57.845 --> 19:01.890
I believe I was clear when I requested
only the navigation data,

19:01.974 --> 19:04.434
not Arasaka's corporate property.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.603
You got what you
asked for, didn't you?

19:06.687 --> 19:10.190
What I asked for above all else
was your discretion in the matter.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.943
We tried, but you know
how things be sometimes.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.444
Gotta improvise.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.240
It was imperative I learned
Tanaka's routines the places he frequents.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.535
So check the navigation data.
It's all there.

19:21.618 --> 19:25.747
Your joyride put us back at square one
and Tanaka on high alert.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.083
He's already switch sides.
The data is useless.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.960
Okay, switched and sided for what?

19:30.043 --> 19:31.420
That's not for you to know.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.674
Damn! How the hell we supposed to do the
job right when you leave us in the dark?

19:35.757 --> 19:40.387
The less you know, the less I risk.
Understand this and understand it fast.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.055
I do not pay you to think.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.933
I pay you to check the boxes off my list.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.644
It is my place
to see the larger picture.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.731
It is yours to listen.
You will do what you're told.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.941
That is how our business is done.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.277
Are we clear?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.991
Yeah, we're crystal, dude.

20:01.074 --> 20:05.370
Very good. For now, we'll wait
until he lowers his guard again.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.788
I'll be in touch.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.208
Uh-huh. See you.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.379
Who was that?

20:15.172 --> 20:18.675
Faraday. The middleman
who landed us the gig.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.720
He happens to be a top fixer
around these ports.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.182
Thought you were the big boss
making all the calls.

20:25.265 --> 20:29.811
No, I'm the guy who gets shit done.
And he's the one holding all the 'ennies.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.690
Without him and his crutch,
you ain't nothing in this biz.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.359
It's as simple as that.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.862
Don't think too hard about it.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.906
We're celebrating tonight.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.658
Mm.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.381
Heh-heh-heh!

20:59.466 --> 21:03.470
Hey, baby! What do you say, huh?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.891
-Yo.
-Mm.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.227
Um, sorry, but, who are you?

21:10.310 --> 21:13.814
Remember. Come on,
after all we've bee through?

21:13.897 --> 21:15.232
Hmm.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.279
Oh, right. You were at the bar.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.322
Yeah. You like my performance?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.157
-Uh, sure. Yeah.
-Mm.

21:24.908 --> 21:28.537
I'm Rebecca.
I heard you're joining up on Maine's crew?

21:28.620 --> 21:31.290
Maybe. Is this carbonated?

21:31.373 --> 21:32.791
Cheers!

21:32.874 --> 21:36.044
Be seeing you around, then. Bu-bye!

21:36.128 --> 21:37.546
Yeah. See you.

21:45.429 --> 21:50.142
<i>Mr. Martinez, hello again.</i>
<i>Is this a good time?</i>

21:50.225 --> 21:51.810
<i>It sounds rather rowdy on your end.</i>

21:52.728 --> 21:54.313
Uh, yeah, but it's fine.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.524
<i>I trust you received</i>
<i>the message that I left?</i>

21:57.607 --> 21:59.234
Yeah, I got it.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.778
<i>Excellent. Now, about your apology to--</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:04.197
Pass this along
to Katsuo for me, would you?

22:04.281 --> 22:06.074
<i>Er, perhaps it's best if you would--</i>

22:06.158 --> 22:09.328
If he wants revenge,
tell that prick I'll be waiting.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.829
But I'm done going easy.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.497
Oh, and you can all kiss my ass!
