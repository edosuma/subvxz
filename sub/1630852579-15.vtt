NARRATOR:
A mysterious metal object
that defies ex

00:04.958 --> 00:06.417
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
Very strange.

00:06.542 --> 00:08.708
So what does the museum
have to say about this?

00:08.875 --> 00:11.292
It is a strange piece
for us as well.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.833
NARRATOR:
An ancient stone carving

00:14.000 --> 00:16.708
that may possess
advanced technology.

00:16.875 --> 00:20.792
DAVID SEDAT:
Inside the crystalline
structure were great

00:20.875 --> 00:23.083
memory chip banks.

00:23.208 --> 00:25.542
NARRATOR:
An extraordinary crystal skull

00:25.708 --> 00:28.250
with strange properties.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.917
So, what are we looking at here?

00:30.042 --> 00:30.958
JAMIE JONES:
It seems to be a very strong,

00:31.083 --> 00:32.625
protective energy.

00:32.708 --> 00:35.333
NARRATOR: On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we've investigated

00:35.458 --> 00:37.792
the world's oldest
and most incredible

00:37.917 --> 00:41.250
relics up close and in person.

00:41.375 --> 00:46.167
Now, we take a look back at some
of the most mysterious artifacts

00:46.292 --> 00:48.333
we've examined
all over the globe.

00:48.500 --> 00:53.000
Artifacts that, according to
ancient astronaut theorists,

00:53.125 --> 00:57.333
provide undeniable proof
of extraterrestrial contact.

♪ ♪

01:12.917 --> 01:15.250
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have examined

01:15.375 --> 01:18.167
some of the most mysterious
artifacts on Earth.

01:18.292 --> 01:21.000
Artifacts that, I believe,

01:21.083 --> 01:24.000
offer compelling evidence
that our ancestors

01:24.125 --> 01:26.500
were visited by
extraterrestrials.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.417
And that is exactly
what I found when I traveled

01:30.542 --> 01:34.500
to a museum in Romania with
Erich von Däniken to examine

01:34.667 --> 01:39.167
one of the most extraordinary
relics ever discovered.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.833
NARRATOR:
Workers digging a trench

01:48.958 --> 01:50.542
along the banks
of the Mures River

01:50.667 --> 01:52.750
unearth two giant bones.

01:53.708 --> 01:56.375
And with them,
a mysterious metal object,

01:56.500 --> 01:59.625
buried 35 feet
beneath the surface.

02:00.708 --> 02:04.125
The discovery brings
the project to a halt

02:04.208 --> 02:08.625
as the crew takes their
findings to a nearby museum.

02:08.708 --> 02:13.250
This strange object, known
today as the Wedge of Aiud,

02:13.375 --> 02:16.000
continues to baffle
archaeologists

02:16.125 --> 02:18.333
because it is an aluminum alloy

02:18.417 --> 02:21.125
that appears to have been
made thousands of years

02:21.208 --> 02:25.375
before humans were able
to smelt or fabricate metal.

02:26.583 --> 02:31.667
It was 10 meters in depth
associated with some bones,

02:31.750 --> 02:35.375
which they later identified
as woolly mammoth bones.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.208
If they were contemporary,

02:38.375 --> 02:40.958
all of them, then they were
in use sometime in the period

02:41.042 --> 02:44.042
when Neanderthals
roamed the Earth.

02:44.167 --> 02:46.167
So they were extinct
40,000 years ago,

02:46.250 --> 02:48.208
so they must be older than that.

02:49.750 --> 02:53.500
The Wedge was analyzed
three times to my knowledge.

02:53.625 --> 02:57.792
The main metal in its
composition is aluminum.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.167
MICHAEL DENNIN:
Humans didn't really
start working

03:00.292 --> 03:03.208
with aluminum until well
into the 1800s.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.042
So when you look at
this wedge and you analyze it,

03:06.208 --> 03:08.500
it really has most
of the modern properties

03:08.625 --> 03:10.375
we would associate
with aluminum.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.417
NARRATOR:
In January of 2017,

03:14.542 --> 03:16.167
ancient astronaut theorists

03:16.250 --> 03:18.917
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and Erich von Däniken

03:19.042 --> 03:20.750
were offered a rare opportunity

03:20.875 --> 03:23.833
to get a firsthand look
at the Wedge of Aiud.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.167
Museum curator Ana Gruia

03:27.292 --> 03:28.958
has taken it out of
a storage locker

03:29.042 --> 03:30.500
where it has been
deliberately hidden

03:30.625 --> 03:33.500
from the public
since the early 1970s.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.500
Okay.

03:35.625 --> 03:36.625
This is exciting.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.708
Okay, I'm just gonna put
my gloves on.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.500
TSOUKALOS:
This is great.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.792
GRUIA:
So this is it.

03:44.917 --> 03:47.042
-VON DÄNIKEN: Oh, wow.
-TSOUKALOS: Okay.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.167
VON DÄNIKEN:
This is strange.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.625
It's very heavy.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.750
-Giorgio, take it, it's heavy.
-This is crazy.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.333
TSOUKALOS:
Wow.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.375
And this was found at a depth

04:00.500 --> 04:03.167
of 10 meters,
which is about 30 feet,

04:03.333 --> 04:04.458
-in the ground.
-GRUIA: Yes.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.542
TSOUKALOS:
Yes, and here, this is

04:06.667 --> 04:09.792
where they took the sample out,
and here, to make the analysis.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.333
And here you see two pieces

04:11.458 --> 04:12.667
that are broken off, sort of.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.792
So maybe it was attached
or something.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.833
But very strange.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.500
So what does the museum
have to say about this?

04:20.667 --> 04:23.500
This is a very strange piece.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.208
It is, it is a strange piece
for us as well.

04:26.375 --> 04:29.292
As historians,
we do not consider it

04:29.417 --> 04:32.250
a historical object
that we're used to.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.667
We don't know
what it was used for,

04:34.750 --> 04:39.167
and we acknowledge these
uncertainties about its dating,

04:39.250 --> 04:41.458
and its composition as well.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.833
VON DÄNIKEN:
So, for what can you use this?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.542
It looks like a hammer
or a shovel, but, Giorgio,

04:48.708 --> 04:50.083
what is the word of, in English?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.792
(speaking in foreign language)

04:51.875 --> 04:54.208
-Oh, an excavator tooth.
-VON DÄNIKEN: Well,

04:54.333 --> 04:55.833
it looks like this.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
-It could have been
something like it.
-Yeah.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.375
VON DÄNIKEN:
But these excavator tooths

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
-are never made out of aluminum.
-TSOUKALOS: No, it's too weak.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.125
-VON DÄNIKEN: Aluminum
is too soft.
-TSOUKALOS: Yeah.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.333
VON DÄNIKEN:
They are made out of steel.

05:05.458 --> 05:08.250
Especially hard steel,
so it could not be that.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.500
So we have a real mystery here.

05:10.625 --> 05:16.000
But you see this patina
over this whole object?

05:16.167 --> 05:17.708
And this creates
another problem.

05:17.833 --> 05:20.833
TSOUKALOS: Yes, because
you cannot fake a patina.

05:20.958 --> 05:21.875
It's impossible

05:22.000 --> 05:25.542
to artificially create a patina.

05:26.792 --> 05:30.167
NARRATOR:
The patina is a thin coating
of various metal compounds

05:30.333 --> 05:32.458
that forms
on the surface of the metal

05:32.583 --> 05:35.375
during exposure
to atmospheric elements.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.667
The older the object,

05:37.792 --> 05:40.375
the thicker
the patina layer will be.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.500
It takes hundreds,
if not thousands of years

05:45.625 --> 05:47.917
for a thick layer of patina,

05:48.042 --> 05:50.167
as this apparently is,

05:50.292 --> 05:51.708
for it to develop.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.750
Yes, we agree there are
two basic problems.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.250
One, that aluminum
was not invented

05:56.375 --> 06:00.167
at the age when we presume
this was in use.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.542
And second, it's the patina,
as you noted.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.292
VON DÄNIKEN:
Which speaks for the date.

06:04.375 --> 06:05.750
-TSOUKALOS: Yes.
-VON DÄNIKEN: For the age of it.

06:05.875 --> 06:09.458
So we-we still
have a mystery here.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.667
TSOUKALOS:
Thank you very much for

06:11.833 --> 06:15.042
showing us this object because
I know that there was a time

06:15.167 --> 06:17.917
when nobody knew where it was,

06:18.042 --> 06:20.000
somewhere in a box in the back.

06:20.083 --> 06:24.000
Which means present-day
archaeology has a problem.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.792
And they're doing
magnificent work.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.750
But when something
like this comes along,

06:27.875 --> 06:30.250
you know, we should
investigate this

06:30.375 --> 06:32.917
and not put it in
a box in the back.

06:33.042 --> 06:35.458
-Definitely.
-GRUIA: It did depend
on mentalities

06:35.542 --> 06:37.250
-in official position.
-Yes. (chuckling)

06:37.375 --> 06:40.375
It isn't currently exhibited

06:40.500 --> 06:42.417
because we have to admit,

06:42.542 --> 06:46.375
as historians,
that we do not know

06:46.500 --> 06:48.208
more details about it.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.375
For us it's just baffling
at this point.

06:51.542 --> 06:56.000
But taking the-the logic
further, this conflicting

06:56.125 --> 06:59.333
information could have
just two solutions so far:

06:59.458 --> 07:04.375
One, that it is really
not so old and the context

07:04.500 --> 07:08.000
is irrelevant, and the patina
was somehow produced

07:08.083 --> 07:09.708
in special circumstances.

07:09.875 --> 07:13.417
So it's a new object
strangely preserved, let's say.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.417
And the second option is,
of course,

07:15.542 --> 07:18.750
that it's not
of terrestrial origin.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.083
In all of your adventures,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.875
how does this compare

07:23.042 --> 07:26.167
to some of the other things
that are inexplicable?

07:26.292 --> 07:28.458
I am helpless. I have no idea.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.083
-That says it all right there.
-(chuckling)

07:31.208 --> 07:33.750
Very bizarre. Bizarre.

I've known about this thing
since the early 1990s,

and I have to tell you
that looking at it

07:44.417 --> 07:48.167
in person was a dream come true.

07:48.333 --> 07:52.625
And it's a very strange thing.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.542
I mean, how do you explain this?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.875
It certainly looks

07:57.000 --> 08:01.042
as if it was part
of a larger object.

08:02.167 --> 08:06.583
The question is, was it
a component of a device?

08:06.708 --> 08:09.125
Was it a component
of something larger?

NARRATOR:
If the Wedge of Aiud really is
over 40,000 years old,

08:15.750 --> 08:19.125
then who made it,
and what was it used for?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.292
Some ancient astronaut theorists

08:22.375 --> 08:24.583
believe they may have
the answer.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.875
An aeronautical engineer
who saw the Aiud Wedge

08:29.042 --> 08:30.250
looked at it and said,

08:30.375 --> 08:31.958
"That's a piece of
a landing gear

08:32.083 --> 08:35.583
for a vertical takeoff
and landing aircraft."

08:35.708 --> 08:39.042
Ancient astronaut theorists
have also looked at this wedge

08:39.208 --> 08:41.000
and surmised that it's possible

that it's part of a crashed
extraterrestrial craft.

Could the Wedge of Aiud

Ancient astronaut

about these
otherworldly visitors

09:18.875 --> 09:21.667
On a recent trip
to Copán, Honduras,

09:21.792 --> 09:23.458
I met with an archaeologist

09:23.542 --> 09:25.333
who showed me some
intriguing examples

09:25.500 --> 09:27.042
of these Mayan artifacts

09:27.167 --> 09:28.708
that he suggests

09:28.875 --> 09:31.917
may have served
a technological purpose.

with renowned Mayan
archaeologist David Sedat

09:46.667 --> 09:48.458
who's been involved
in the excavation

09:48.583 --> 09:51.167
of the site for more
than three decades.

09:51.292 --> 09:54.042
TSOUKALOS:
David, great pleasure
to meet you.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.792
SEDAT:
Well, I've been
looking forward to this.

09:55.917 --> 09:57.333
I'm sure you have a lot
of things you want to see.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.667
TSOUKALOS:
This is... Yes, I do.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.167
So, David, what are we
looking at here?

10:01.292 --> 10:02.208
SEDAT:
Well,

10:02.333 --> 10:04.000
this is the Great Plaza.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.167
It's over 100 meters, uh,
larger than a football field.

10:07.333 --> 10:11.583
And it's the southern portion

10:11.708 --> 10:14.125
of the Great Plaza
with the majority of the great

10:14.250 --> 10:17.000
standing stone giants that
you've come to see are located.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.042
NARRATOR:
On the grounds at Copán

10:19.208 --> 10:22.625
are dozens of stone
statues called stelae.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.667
The most well-known of these

10:24.792 --> 10:27.708
were built during
the 43-year reign of the ruler

10:27.833 --> 10:29.833
Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil,

10:29.958 --> 10:33.125
better known by
the nickname "18 Rabbit."

TSOUKALOS:
This is the first time

10:35.875 --> 10:37.333
I'm standing next
to one of these.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.000
Absolutely incredible.

10:40.083 --> 10:44.208
What do the glyphs say
about this particular statue

10:44.333 --> 10:45.250
or stela here?

10:46.250 --> 10:49.042
SEDAT:
This is all
a representation of

10:49.167 --> 10:52.917
the 13th ruler, whom we
have nicknamed 18 Rabbit.

10:53.042 --> 10:57.083
And they show him
taking on the persona

10:57.208 --> 11:03.208
of the high god of Copán,
Ju'n Ajaw, who was a sky god.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.667
The supreme being.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.833
The motifs on his headdress

11:06.958 --> 11:10.375
and other attributes
show that he is a sky deity.

11:10.542 --> 11:15.958
This is amazing to me
because here we have not only

11:16.042 --> 11:20.333
a statue depicting something,
which is a picture,

11:20.458 --> 11:21.542
a carved picture,

11:21.708 --> 11:23.583
but on the sides,
we have writing,

11:23.708 --> 11:27.792
glyphs carved
that speak of a sky deity.

11:29.333 --> 11:32.167
Now, when I look at
something like this,

11:32.292 --> 11:35.750
I'm immediately reminded
of misunderstood technology.

11:35.875 --> 11:40.333
Because imagine,
if a people who are

11:40.417 --> 11:44.750
intelligent yet their
technological frame of reference

11:44.875 --> 11:48.792
from 1,000 or 2,000 years ago
we have to admit was primitive,

11:48.917 --> 11:50.833
not their intelligence,

11:50.917 --> 11:53.000
their technological
frame of reference.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.833
Of course,
let me just add to that

11:55.917 --> 11:57.833
that everything

11:58.000 --> 12:01.917
shows his connectedness
of the cosmos

12:02.042 --> 12:06.125
and this living space
of mankind in all of its senses.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.542
And by the way,

12:07.667 --> 12:09.833
I have seen that
headdress right there

12:09.958 --> 12:11.958
elsewhere on planet Earth.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.000
And that is in Mesopotamia.

12:14.083 --> 12:18.333
So the fact that we have
these examples worldwide

12:18.458 --> 12:20.583
leads me to think that it was

12:20.708 --> 12:22.875
a flesh and blood
extraterrestrial

12:23.000 --> 12:27.708
whom our ancestors
misinterpreted as being God.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.333
Why? Because
they came from the sky.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.167
Arthur C. Clarke
said it best when he said,

12:33.292 --> 12:36.792
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

12:36.875 --> 12:39.667
is indistinguishable
from magic."

12:39.792 --> 12:42.250
Imagine showing

12:42.375 --> 12:45.375
your great-great-grandfather
your smart phone.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.000
-Right. That's right.
(laughing)
-All of a sudden,

12:48.125 --> 12:49.792
you've become
a magician, a wizard.

12:49.917 --> 12:53.542
When we talk about technology,

12:53.667 --> 12:56.500
I imagine someday in the future

12:56.625 --> 12:59.000
that the technology will be such

12:59.125 --> 13:01.167
that we'll be able to scan

13:01.292 --> 13:02.417
this stela here...

13:03.583 --> 13:07.000
...and receive the resonances

13:07.083 --> 13:11.000
that are inside the crystalline
structure of the stone.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.500
In other words,
that these were great

13:13.583 --> 13:15.542
memory chip banks.

13:15.667 --> 13:16.750
Wow, okay.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.833
And in the appropriate algorithm

13:19.958 --> 13:22.167
we could peel back into time

13:22.250 --> 13:25.208
by hearing the sights and sounds

13:25.375 --> 13:27.125
and everything
that happened in this

13:27.250 --> 13:30.542
sacred space and maybe
answer some of the questions

13:30.667 --> 13:32.458
that you were posing.

13:32.542 --> 13:35.625
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that these
Mayan stone giants

13:35.708 --> 13:37.375
were designed in such a way

13:37.500 --> 13:40.625
as to be able to digitally
store valuable data?

13:41.750 --> 13:44.375
NOVA SPIVACK:
We've learned a lot about
how ancient civilizations

13:44.500 --> 13:47.667
understood our solar system
and their world.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.417
These civilizations
had advanced technologies

13:50.542 --> 13:51.875
for working with
stone and metal,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.833
and in some cases crystals.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.417
We still don't know
how they did what they did.

13:56.542 --> 14:00.458
It's reasonable that,
given these monuments exist,

14:00.583 --> 14:02.792
that we should analyze them
to see if there's

14:02.917 --> 14:06.208
other layers of information
encoded in them.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.333
DAVID CHILDRESS:
If these statues were

14:09.417 --> 14:13.833
in fact devices that had
recorded information,

14:13.958 --> 14:17.625
you wonder if we have also

14:17.750 --> 14:21.000
some evidence here
from the statues of Copán

14:21.167 --> 14:24.500
that extraterrestrials
are coming to this planet.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.458
NARRATOR:
Could the ancient
stone giants of Copán

14:29.542 --> 14:31.667
really be encoded with
precious information

14:31.792 --> 14:34.125
about the ancient world?

14:34.208 --> 14:37.500
And if so, might they
also hold evidence

14:37.625 --> 14:39.917
of extraterrestrial contact?

14:41.083 --> 14:44.208
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

14:44.333 --> 14:47.250
the answer is a profound yes.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.000
And to prove their point,

14:50.125 --> 14:51.958
they believe
that one of the keys

14:52.083 --> 14:54.750
can be found by examining
the elaborate carvings

14:54.875 --> 14:58.500
located on what is
referred to as Stela C...

14:58.583 --> 15:01.500
the same one that David Sedat

15:01.583 --> 15:03.542
considers the most incredible.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.500
The inscription on this side

15:07.583 --> 15:09.583
starts a 20-year period

15:09.708 --> 15:12.875
equivalent to
December 5 of 711.

15:14.583 --> 15:19.000
And midnight on that night,
the Milky Way was standing

15:19.083 --> 15:21.708
precisely straight up
in the tropical sky here.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.375
The text goes on to say

15:24.500 --> 15:29.292
that this also happened
4,600 years before.

15:29.375 --> 15:34.000
And there is strong implication
that he was as well,

15:34.125 --> 15:39.167
like on that night,
witnessing this celestial event.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.625
NARRATOR:
Witnessing the event?

15:42.708 --> 15:46.000
Is it possible that the ruler
depicted on the stelae

15:46.125 --> 15:47.917
known as 18 Rabbit

15:48.042 --> 15:51.167
was able to observe
an astronomical event

15:51.250 --> 15:55.583
that occurred more than
4,000 years before his time?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.167
Let me show you
how the narrative

15:59.333 --> 16:00.833
picks up on the other side.

16:00.958 --> 16:02.583
All right, let's check it out.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.667
So now here,

16:07.750 --> 16:09.792
-this guy has a beard.
-Well, yes.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.375
This is still 18 Rabbit,

16:12.500 --> 16:15.500
but he's achieved
great age, great wisdom.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.333
Telling us that he is

16:17.417 --> 16:20.792
witnessing this astronomical
conjunction of the Milky Way

16:20.875 --> 16:22.917
two million years ago.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.458
Two million years ago?

16:24.542 --> 16:25.833
-Two million years ago.
-So this guy here...

16:25.958 --> 16:27.125
And he witnessed it.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.833
Now, he witnesses
this astronomical

16:30.958 --> 16:33.542
conjunction of the Milky Way

16:33.667 --> 16:36.750
two million years in the future.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.083
-As well?
-As well.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.833
TSOUKALOS:
That's extraordinary.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.875
SEDAT:
So these stones have to be seen

16:43.042 --> 16:47.167
as the supernatural
personas that can travel

16:47.333 --> 16:52.083
in time simultaneously
backwards and forwards.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.375
You've just blown my mind.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.500
NARRATOR:
Supernatural personas that
can travel through time?

17:00.625 --> 17:04.458
If the statues of Copán
were really created

17:04.583 --> 17:07.125
as a means of storing
valuable ancient knowledge,

17:07.208 --> 17:10.125
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

17:10.208 --> 17:14.667
then how and why did that
knowledge come to be lost...

17:15.792 --> 17:19.458
...along with the keys needed
to unlock their secrets?

17:19.583 --> 17:22.833
Perhaps the answers
can be found by examining

17:22.917 --> 17:25.750
another group
of mysterious stones

17:25.875 --> 17:29.000
that may have
extraterrestrial origins.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.292
Many of the mystererious
artifacts

17:34.375 --> 17:35.625
we've investigated
on <i>Ancient Aliens</i> are,

17:35.708 --> 17:37.208
in my opinion,

17:37.333 --> 17:40.208
objects that our ancestors
created to document

17:40.375 --> 17:43.250
encounters with
otherworldly beings.

17:43.375 --> 17:46.500
But every now and then
we have come across an artifact

17:46.583 --> 17:50.375
that may itself be
of extraterrestrial origin.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.583
In 2019, David Childress
got the rare opportunity

17:54.708 --> 17:58.417
to scientifically test
strange stones that are unlike

17:58.542 --> 18:02.667
anything we've ever
found on planet Earth.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.542
NARRATOR:
Sierra Leone, Africa.

18:08.833 --> 18:11.042
The early 1990s.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.042
As civil war rages
across the country...

18:18.125 --> 18:19.958
...rebels begin forcing
villagers to mine

18:20.083 --> 18:22.042
so-called "blood diamonds."

18:23.208 --> 18:25.875
But from deep within the earth
emerges a vast treasure

18:26.000 --> 18:27.750
they weren't expecting.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.083
They discover mysterious figures

18:32.208 --> 18:34.500
ranging from five
to ten inches tall...

18:36.292 --> 18:39.083
...often with reptilian
or amphibian features

18:39.208 --> 18:41.500
known as Nomoli.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.708
CHILDRESS:
They're very strange statues.

18:44.875 --> 18:48.667
Some are clay, some are of
granite or limestone.

18:49.875 --> 18:54.417
They are humans and human
figures with lizard heads.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.250
There are hundreds of them.

18:58.708 --> 19:02.083
NARRATOR:
According to legend,
the Nomoli represent sky gods.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.500
When they fell from the heaven,

19:04.583 --> 19:08.417
part of the sky turned to stone
and rained down with them.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.667
Curiously, strange blue stones

19:11.792 --> 19:16.125
can be found buried with many
of the Nomoli figurines.

19:16.208 --> 19:20.333
These strange blue stones
called skystones

19:20.458 --> 19:24.500
have been found with
the statues and at first,

19:24.625 --> 19:27.417
archaeologists thought,
okay, it's just blue stones.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.667
But when they analyzed it,

19:29.833 --> 19:33.958
they couldn't figure out
how these had been made, too.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.333
Although the people
in Sierra Leone felt

19:36.458 --> 19:39.333
that they were actually
pieces of the blue sky

19:39.458 --> 19:41.833
that fell with the Nomoli.

19:43.542 --> 19:47.000
NARRATOR:
If these mysterious blue stones
are really connected

19:47.125 --> 19:49.833
to the legend of the sky
turning to stone

19:49.958 --> 19:53.250
and raining down on the Earth
with the arrival of the Nomoli,

19:53.375 --> 19:55.333
what could they be?

19:58.125 --> 20:03.417
Seattle, Washington.
March 6, 2019.

20:04.625 --> 20:08.042
In search of further evidence
that the Nomoli statues may have

20:08.167 --> 20:10.625
an extraterrestrial connection,

20:10.708 --> 20:13.292
ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

20:13.375 --> 20:16.000
has arranged to meet up
with skystone collector

20:16.125 --> 20:17.792
and researcher Jared Collins.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.250
Wow.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.250
NARRATOR:
Jared has in his possession

20:21.375 --> 20:23.250
a number of
the mysterious blue stones

20:23.375 --> 20:26.125
that were found
near the statues.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.583
So how was it that these stones

20:27.708 --> 20:29.500
were actually discovered
in modern time?

20:29.583 --> 20:32.917
This was actually
discovered in 1991

20:33.042 --> 20:34.708
by a man named David Leadbetter.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.042
He was in Sierra Leone
on a mining concession

20:38.167 --> 20:39.542
looking for gold and diamonds.

20:39.708 --> 20:43.708
And when he was
having his crew dig,

20:43.875 --> 20:46.583
occasionally,
these stones would appear.

20:46.708 --> 20:48.833
What do other
geologists say about

20:49.000 --> 20:51.667
stones like this?
Are they able to identify them?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.833
COLLINS:
We've sent these now
to 12 different labs.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.458
There is not one piece
of consensus in here.

20:56.542 --> 20:57.833
Everybody has
a different opinion.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.083
We still don't know,
actually, if these are

21:00.208 --> 21:02.583
-natural or man-made.
-So maybe it's
from another planet.

21:02.708 --> 21:03.833
I don't know.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.958
I really wish I did,
and I would love a chance

21:06.042 --> 21:07.667
to actually be able to get this

21:07.750 --> 21:09.583
in front of somebody else
who could look at it again.

21:09.708 --> 21:12.375
I've got some friends at
the University of Washington

21:12.500 --> 21:14.917
and I think we can set this up
and have another test done.

21:15.042 --> 21:16.792
That would be fantastic.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.667
I would love to get
some consensus on this

21:18.792 --> 21:20.958
to understand
what this actually is.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.333
NARRATOR:
While tests conducted
on the stones found

21:24.458 --> 21:27.500
with the Nomoli statues
have so far produced

21:27.625 --> 21:31.292
conflicting and sometimes
even confounding results,

21:31.375 --> 21:35.417
David is eager to have them
tested for himself.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.458
At the University of Washington,

21:41.542 --> 21:44.958
David and Jared meet
with renowned geologist

21:45.042 --> 21:47.250
Professor Peter Ward.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.833
Hi, I'm David Childress.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.167
-I talked to you on the phone.
-David.

21:50.292 --> 21:51.167
It's good to meet you.

21:51.292 --> 21:52.542
And this is Jared Collins.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.292
Thank you so much
for seeing us today.

21:54.375 --> 21:55.708
Jared, both of you guys,

21:55.833 --> 21:58.458
welcome to the University
of Washington IsoLab.

21:58.542 --> 22:01.417
So, what do we have
in this beautiful box?

22:01.542 --> 22:04.000
Well, we're sort of hoping
that you can tell us.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.625
Well, well, well,
what are these beauties?

22:10.750 --> 22:13.333
We have been through
many tests on these,

22:13.417 --> 22:14.875
and no one can identify them.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.542
They cannot tell us whether

22:16.708 --> 22:19.667
these are natural or artificial,
what's causing the blue color,

22:19.792 --> 22:21.250
if this is ancient or modern.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.167
So, they've been checked for

22:23.250 --> 22:25.000
the common blue minerals,
I take it?

22:25.125 --> 22:27.792
One thing that we know for sure
is that this is not turquoise.

22:27.875 --> 22:30.625
This is not lapis.
This is not erinite.

22:30.708 --> 22:33.833
WARD:
The fact that it's so
unbelievably light

22:33.958 --> 22:37.542
really suggests that there's
an organic component to it.

22:37.667 --> 22:40.500
Anything that goes blue
generally is much heavier,

22:40.667 --> 22:42.625
So this is,
this is really a mystery.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.042
COLLINS:
I should mention also

22:44.167 --> 22:47.167
that this only comes from
one very specific part,

22:47.292 --> 22:48.792
from one very specific village.

22:48.875 --> 22:51.000
It has never been found
anywhere else in the world.

22:51.083 --> 22:54.500
Well, let's do a test
that removes any doubt

22:54.583 --> 22:56.750
about them being partly organic.

22:58.167 --> 23:00.208
So Erin is gonna take this rock

23:00.333 --> 23:02.333
and she's gonna
scrape it into these

23:02.500 --> 23:05.500
tiny little tin cups.

23:05.667 --> 23:09.500
The tin cups themselves will
load into our mass spectrograph.

23:09.625 --> 23:12.333
They will then be heated to
a thousand degrees centigrade.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.333
Everything inside will combust
and turn to gas.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.000
And those individual
gas molecules will then

23:18.083 --> 23:21.375
be sampled and we can examine
if there are any truly organic

23:21.542 --> 23:24.583
molecules in this rock.

23:24.708 --> 23:28.750
Was there some life process that
was involved in its formation?

23:30.917 --> 23:34.333
NARRATOR:
David and Jared return home
to wait for the results.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.625
When Dr. Ward receives them
two weeks later,

23:37.708 --> 23:39.833
he sends an email to David

23:39.917 --> 23:41.750
remarking that what
the scientists found

23:41.875 --> 23:44.958
was so strange, they ran
the tests three times,

23:45.042 --> 23:48.000
thinking it was
a machine error and added:

23:48.083 --> 23:50.667
"This gives me the creeps."

23:51.875 --> 23:55.500
To learn more, David contacted
Dr. Ward through video chat.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.417
Hi, Doctor Ward.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.500
So I wanted to learn
about the results?

23:59.625 --> 24:01.500
<i>Yeah, it was pretty cool.</i>

24:01.625 --> 24:03.375
<i>I mean, it was much
stranger than we thought.</i>

24:03.500 --> 24:05.167
<i>There really seems to be
some sort of organic</i>

24:05.292 --> 24:06.417
<i>aspect to this.</i>

24:06.542 --> 24:09.250
<i>It's got element nitrogen in it</i>

24:09.375 --> 24:11.208
<i>in really high concentrations.</i>

24:11.375 --> 24:13.583
<i>Having this high
amount of nitrogen</i>

24:13.708 --> 24:17.875
<i>puts it into a, "Wow, that's
a very peculiar rock" category.</i>

24:18.000 --> 24:21.792
We were looking for a possible
extraterrestrial origin.

24:21.917 --> 24:24.542
Is it possibly
a meteorite or even

24:24.667 --> 24:27.208
part of a spaceship
that exploded?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.083
<i>(laughing)</i>

24:29.208 --> 24:32.000
<i>Let's just say that there's
a possibility that it came</i>

24:32.125 --> 24:33.750
<i>from off the Earth.</i>

24:33.875 --> 24:37.000
<i>As we scientists say,
"It's worth more study."</i>

24:38.250 --> 24:41.500
NARRATOR:
Although the skystones
are still a mystery,

24:41.667 --> 24:43.625
David and Jared have confirmed

24:43.708 --> 24:46.625
that they are unlike any
other stone ever examined.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.458
Could they have arrived
on Earth with the strange beings

24:50.583 --> 24:53.458
that are depicted
in the Nomoli statues?

24:53.542 --> 24:56.583
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

24:56.708 --> 24:59.667
and they claim that further
evidence of extraterrestrial

24:59.833 --> 25:02.667
visitation in the distant past

25:02.792 --> 25:06.917
can be found in one of the most
remote places in the world.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.458
On <i>Ancient Aliens</i> we have
traveled around the world

25:13.583 --> 25:16.458
to get a closer look
at mysterious artifacts.

25:16.542 --> 25:19.750
And sometimes, we find
evidence of alien contact

25:19.875 --> 25:21.458
hiding in plain sight.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.667
This is exactly what happened

25:23.792 --> 25:25.167
when David Childress
and I traveled

25:25.292 --> 25:28.125
to the remote Marquesas Islands
and were shown

25:28.208 --> 25:31.708
an ancient statue that,
as far as we were concerned,

25:31.833 --> 25:34.042
clearly represents something

25:34.208 --> 25:38.708
very different from what
mainstream scholars suggest.

25:44.208 --> 25:46.417
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists

25:46.542 --> 25:49.208
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and David Childress

25:49.375 --> 25:53.875
are in the Marquesas Islands,
investigating potential evidence

25:54.042 --> 25:55.583
that this remote
part of the world

25:55.708 --> 25:59.583
was once inhabited by
extraterrestrial visitors.

26:01.417 --> 26:02.708
Hello.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.583
CHILDRESS:
It's good to see you.

26:06.625 --> 26:07.750
-TSOUKALOS: Yeah.
-CHILDRESS: Okay.

26:07.875 --> 26:08.833
NARRATOR:
As their local guide,

26:08.958 --> 26:10.792
they've enlisted
Hiva Oa resident

26:10.917 --> 26:12.917
Heimata Bonno who will show them

26:13.042 --> 26:15.500
some of the mysterious
sculptures

26:15.667 --> 26:18.333
found on the island,
known as tikis.

26:18.417 --> 26:22.125
These statuaries represent
the ancestral gods and goddesses

26:22.208 --> 26:25.375
that came to the islands
in ancient times.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.708
-TSOUKALOS: This is incredible.
-CHILDRESS: Yeah.

26:28.875 --> 26:31.292
TSOUKALOS: So what are we
looking at here? What is this?

26:46.125 --> 26:48.750
Oh, it totally looks
like a llama.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.833
TSOUKALOS: I totally think
this looks like a llama.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I mean, there is
no question in my mind.

26:56.125 --> 26:59.292
And I also don't think
that this was altered.

26:59.375 --> 27:00.833
This is original.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.000
And I don't see any changes.

27:03.125 --> 27:06.500
CHILDRESS: So either
this is not authentic,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.958
or if it is authentic
it's a llama,

27:09.083 --> 27:12.333
and it proves connection
to-to South America.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.667
NARRATOR:
South America?

27:15.833 --> 27:18.083
Is it possible that the llama,

27:18.208 --> 27:20.333
believed to be native
to South America,

27:20.458 --> 27:24.125
was known to people living
on this remote island chain

27:24.208 --> 27:27.083
some 3,500 miles away?

27:27.208 --> 27:28.333
But how?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.750
CHILDRESS:
Some people say that

27:31.875 --> 27:33.208
it's a woman giving birth.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.542
Do the women here

27:35.667 --> 27:37.208
in the Marquesas islands,
do they do this?

27:37.333 --> 27:39.333
They lie on their stomach
and give birth?

27:40.375 --> 27:41.333
No.

27:42.583 --> 27:44.833
TSOUKALOS:
This is crazy. Huh.

27:44.958 --> 27:49.167
To me, it looks like
something from the sky.

27:49.792 --> 27:52.958
It's like... (groans)
Maybe some flying vehicle.

27:54.167 --> 27:56.083
-It's a great question.
-Yeah.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.875
TSOUKALOS:
Perhaps what we're
looking at here

27:59.000 --> 28:00.667
is some type of a craft.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.875
Because you have
the windows in the front,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.125
which are these giant goggles

28:05.208 --> 28:07.417
and then you have
the mouth in the front

28:07.542 --> 28:10.750
which to me it looks like
some type of an air intake.

28:11.833 --> 28:14.542
Underneath you have
a lifting body

28:14.708 --> 28:17.000
that goes underneath
the entire body.

28:17.167 --> 28:22.375
And if you combine that
with the story of this object

28:22.500 --> 28:24.208
or this woman giving birth,

28:24.375 --> 28:27.167
if someone has never seen

28:27.250 --> 28:30.417
passengers disembarking
from an actual airplane...

28:31.542 --> 28:34.542
...if they have no idea
what is happening,

28:34.667 --> 28:36.792
well, all of a sudden...

28:37.958 --> 28:41.167
...a flying vehicle
is giving birth to people.

28:41.292 --> 28:44.167
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that
this ancient statue

28:44.292 --> 28:46.625
that has been interpreted
in modern times

28:46.708 --> 28:48.333
as a fertility goddess

28:48.417 --> 28:53.208
is actually depicting
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

28:54.125 --> 28:56.792
I think that tikis
are nothing else

28:56.875 --> 28:59.125
but misunderstood technology

28:59.250 --> 29:03.875
that over time
turned into divine objects

29:04.000 --> 29:06.792
of magic and sorcery.

29:15.042 --> 29:16.292
Can we go look at it?

29:16.375 --> 29:17.333
Great.

29:21.042 --> 29:22.083
TSOUKALOS:
Oh, wow.

29:25.042 --> 29:27.083
Clearly this tiki,
the head is missing.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.958
But I see that it has
six fingers.

29:40.375 --> 29:45.250
It's very feasible to me that
they actually tried to imitate

29:45.375 --> 29:49.500
whoever visited or whoever came
here to impart this knowledge.

29:50.875 --> 29:55.333
Why would they carve six fingers
if they did not see six fingers?

29:55.500 --> 29:58.708
So we should not say,
"Oh, this is just fantasy."

29:58.833 --> 30:02.500
I think they saw
someone with six fingers.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.333
Is that possible?

30:04.417 --> 30:05.375
Yeah.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.125
Yes.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.292
TSOUKALOS:
So these are protectors.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.583
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
the mysterious statues

30:28.708 --> 30:31.917
and carvings found
throughout the Marquesas Islands

30:32.042 --> 30:36.042
were made to commemorate
extraterrestrial visitation?

30:37.375 --> 30:40.625
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

30:40.708 --> 30:45.417
and suggest further evidence
of alien contact can be found

30:45.542 --> 30:49.542
by examining strange
skulls made of crystal.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.250
Of the many mysterious
artifacts

30:57.375 --> 30:59.542
we've investigated
on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

30:59.667 --> 31:03.000
some of the most jaw-dropping
are the crystal skulls.

31:03.167 --> 31:05.542
Crystal skulls have been
found all around the world

31:05.708 --> 31:07.000
and some of them have been

31:07.167 --> 31:09.375
carved with such
extraordinary precision that,

31:09.542 --> 31:12.667
in my opinion,
they must have been created

31:12.833 --> 31:15.292
with some type
of advanced technology.

31:15.417 --> 31:18.708
In 2013, David Childress
got to examine

31:18.833 --> 31:22.625
the largest crystal skull
ever discovered.

31:25.958 --> 31:27.875
NARRATOR:
This is Einstein,

31:28.042 --> 31:31.542
believed to be the largest
ancient crystal skull

31:31.667 --> 31:33.083
as yet discovered.

31:34.125 --> 31:37.042
Its owner, Carolyn Ford,
says she obtained

31:37.208 --> 31:40.500
the 33-pound crystal object
more than 20 years ago

31:40.625 --> 31:45.375
from an explorer who discovered
it in Mexico in the early 1900s.

31:46.542 --> 31:50.208
She was unaware that it
possessed any strange abilities

31:50.375 --> 31:52.458
until the day when, she claims,

31:52.583 --> 31:55.333
it actually
communicated with her.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.833
CAROLYN FORD: It was
revealed to me by Einstein

31:57.958 --> 31:59.333
at the moment that I got him

31:59.500 --> 32:01.667
when I knew nothing about
crystal skulls, he said,

32:01.750 --> 32:06.000
"I'm an ancient computer.
In fact, I'm a master computer.

32:08.875 --> 32:11.708
And we record everything,

32:11.875 --> 32:14.667
like a live feed, 24/7.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.542
And that's our purpose."

32:17.625 --> 32:20.458
He's been recording
history on this planet

32:20.542 --> 32:25.000
since the beginning of time,
so indeed he was in Atlantis.

32:26.042 --> 32:29.125
A lot of the ancient
crystal skulls have been

32:29.208 --> 32:32.417
in Atlantis, and even
before that time.

32:33.708 --> 32:36.083
NARRATOR:
Could the so-called
Einstein skull

32:36.208 --> 32:37.708
really be an artifact

32:37.833 --> 32:42.542
from the lost civilization
of Atlantis as its owner claims?

32:46.042 --> 32:49.167
Sedona, Arizona.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.667
2013.

32:53.083 --> 32:56.333
CHILDRESS:
It's very clear down here,
and then it gets cloudy.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.042
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

32:59.167 --> 33:01.500
enlists the help
of aura photography

33:01.625 --> 33:03.292
expert Jamie Jones

33:03.375 --> 33:06.000
in an effort to test
the Einstein skull

33:06.125 --> 33:09.042
for unusual
energy pulses or auras.

33:10.125 --> 33:13.542
These auras are
believed to appear as colors

33:13.708 --> 33:17.167
that correspond to various
physical, emotional,

33:17.250 --> 33:19.583
mental and spiritual states.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.292
JONES:
With aura technology,
we're able to use

33:23.417 --> 33:25.500
biofeedback imaging
to pick up electromagnetic

33:25.667 --> 33:28.250
energy field
around the human body.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.000
I'm not expecting any energy

33:30.125 --> 33:31.792
to be coming out of
the inanimate object.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.167
So I'm a little skeptical

33:33.250 --> 33:36.125
in that I'm not sure
what to expect

33:36.208 --> 33:38.167
when I photograph the skull.

33:38.292 --> 33:40.333
And I've been told
a lot of things about skulls,

33:40.458 --> 33:42.333
as far as information
that they're holding,

33:42.500 --> 33:44.167
what civilizations they're from,

33:44.333 --> 33:46.125
or if they're actually
from the extraterrestrials.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.125
So I'm kind of excited to see

33:48.250 --> 33:50.083
this particular skull
and what it emits.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.500
-Hi, Jamie.
-Hi.

33:52.667 --> 33:53.500
Hey.

33:53.583 --> 33:54.958
And this is Carolyn, and wow,

33:55.042 --> 33:56.167
here is the skull.

33:56.292 --> 33:57.667
JONES:
Wow, this is fabulous.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.583
-So what do we do?
-These are biofeedback censors

33:59.708 --> 34:01.167
and they're gonna be
reading the energy,

34:01.292 --> 34:02.458
if there's energy
around the skull.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.750
So you're gonna
place it on here for me.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.458
Perfect.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.000
CHILDRESS:
So it has to go on both

34:08.125 --> 34:09.500
of the two sensors?

34:09.625 --> 34:11.208
Yes, because both sensors
are picking up energy,

34:11.333 --> 34:13.125
so we want as much
coverage as possible.

34:14.125 --> 34:15.333
-Okay, that's perfect.
-All right.

34:15.458 --> 34:18.000
And now, uh, you just
take a photo of it, huh?

34:18.125 --> 34:19.542
We're gonna take a picture.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.250
All right.

34:27.708 --> 34:29.500
All right.

34:29.583 --> 34:31.792
-And here is the aura
of the skull.
-FORD: Oh, wow.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.125
-CHILDRESS: Okay, wow.
-FORD: Whoa, look at
those colors.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.750
JONES: That is amazing.

34:35.875 --> 34:37.167
-It's amazing.
-Really?

34:37.333 --> 34:38.625
-Oh.
-So, what are we
looking at here?

34:38.708 --> 34:40.500
I mean, here
we can see the skull.

34:40.667 --> 34:43.083
It seems to be very strong,
warrior type protective energy.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.292
And if you look closely,

34:44.417 --> 34:46.500
that energy is arced over.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.292
-Right.
-Literal arc of protection
over the skull.

34:49.417 --> 34:52.667
Now, the blue that we see
throughout the entire picture

34:52.750 --> 34:54.625
is wisdom and knowledge

34:54.750 --> 34:57.542
from traveling many lifetimes
and many dimensions.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.083
<i>CHILDRES: I was surprised,
really, that the aura camera</i>

35:01.208 --> 35:02.500
would pick up so much energy

35:02.625 --> 35:04.667
from the skull
and the different colors.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.167
Some people believe

35:07.292 --> 35:12.042
that crystal skulls have
electro radio wave type

35:12.167 --> 35:15.042
energy that emits from them.

35:15.208 --> 35:17.542
And that the skull
can actually communicate

35:17.667 --> 35:20.917
to people through this energy.

35:21.042 --> 35:24.375
And it seems that
aura photography

35:24.500 --> 35:27.542
can actually pick up
and we can see

35:27.708 --> 35:31.333
these waves that are being
emitted from the skull.

35:31.417 --> 35:35.167
I feel, more than ever,
there is something

35:35.250 --> 35:37.583
to crystal skulls
and the energy behind them.

35:39.333 --> 35:42.708
NARRATOR:
Does the photographed energy
field surrounding Einstein

35:42.833 --> 35:45.458
help to prove that
the crystal skull could,

35:45.542 --> 35:49.292
in fact, be some sort
of recording device?

35:49.417 --> 35:52.333
An extraterrestrial object
used to harness

35:52.458 --> 35:54.708
both energy and information?

35:55.875 --> 35:58.833
Although there have been
hundreds of other crystal skulls

35:58.958 --> 36:00.292
found throughout the world,

36:00.375 --> 36:03.250
the Einstein Skull
is believed to be

36:03.375 --> 36:06.667
one of only 13 authentic
ancient artifacts.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.583
And according to legend,

36:08.708 --> 36:11.250
when all 13
are finally unearthed,

36:11.375 --> 36:14.500
humankind's true past
will be revealed.

36:14.625 --> 36:18.833
CHILDRESS:
Part of this legend is that yes,
these 13 crystal skulls

36:18.958 --> 36:20.250
are extraterrestrial skulls.

36:20.375 --> 36:23.375
And when the 13 skulls
are together,

36:23.500 --> 36:26.792
it'll create a new epoch
for planet Earth.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.167
CHRIS MORTON:
There is certainly a belief

36:29.333 --> 36:31.167
amongst certain
Native American tribes,

36:31.292 --> 36:33.917
when humanity is
at its most desperate,

36:34.042 --> 36:35.500
all of these original

36:35.625 --> 36:40.042
ancient crystal skulls
will come back together

36:40.208 --> 36:44.500
and that they will divulge
their knowledge, their wisdom

36:44.625 --> 36:47.792
that can help
the human race survive.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.333
NARRATOR:
Could these mysterious
crystal artifacts

36:52.417 --> 36:54.708
not only be of alien origin,

36:54.833 --> 36:58.958
but serve a purpose
that has yet to be revealed?

37:00.125 --> 37:02.792
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

37:02.875 --> 37:06.167
and suggest further proof
that extraterrestrials

37:06.333 --> 37:09.125
visited ancient cultures
all over the world

37:09.250 --> 37:11.042
can be found by examining

37:11.167 --> 37:13.583
a mysterious
Middle Eastern artifact

37:13.708 --> 37:16.417
discovered in South America.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.500
Any list of mysterious artifacts

37:23.625 --> 37:25.167
would be incomplete
without featuring

37:25.250 --> 37:26.292
the amazing relics

37:26.417 --> 37:28.167
of Tiahuanaco, Bolivia.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.500
Of all the astounding objects

37:30.625 --> 37:33.167
we've examined from there
on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

37:33.292 --> 37:34.542
one of the most baffling

37:34.667 --> 37:36.792
is the Fuente Magna Bowl.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.875
This beautiful piece
of pottery is covered

37:39.000 --> 37:42.708
in an ancient script that
is native not to Bolivia

37:42.833 --> 37:47.875
but to a culture that existed
on the other side of the world.

37:51.667 --> 37:55.292
Situated at an elevation
of over 12,000 feet

37:55.375 --> 37:58.333
on the Altiplano, lay the ruins

37:58.458 --> 38:00.958
of an ancient temple complex
thought to predate

38:01.042 --> 38:02.625
the Incan Empire.

38:03.708 --> 38:07.542
Standing at the center
of the site is a large statue

38:07.667 --> 38:11.625
believed by many to represent
the creator god Viracocha.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.375
But curiously,

38:13.500 --> 38:17.167
the inhabitants of Tiahuanaco
chose to depict this god

38:17.292 --> 38:19.958
with features unlike their own.

38:20.083 --> 38:24.625
CHILDRESS:
He has got
a beard and a moustache.

38:24.708 --> 38:26.583
And that is an unusual thing

38:26.708 --> 38:30.375
because American Indians do not
have beards and moustaches.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.708
BRIEN FOERSTER:
Exactly.

38:31.833 --> 38:34.000
That indicates that this person

38:34.125 --> 38:35.833
was not a South American native

38:35.958 --> 38:37.583
but clearly came
from another land.

38:37.708 --> 38:40.333
CHILDRESS:
And an important person too,

38:40.417 --> 38:43.208
who's somehow
one of the founders

38:43.375 --> 38:46.167
here of Tiahuanaco.

38:46.333 --> 38:51.625
Maybe even somebody who's come
from Sumeria to South America.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.792
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that the Sumerians,

38:55.875 --> 38:59.458
a civilization
established in 4,000 BC

38:59.583 --> 39:02.833
and located nearly
8,000 miles away

39:02.917 --> 39:06.667
could be connected to the early
inhabitants of Tiahuanaco?

39:07.833 --> 39:09.917
If so, how?

39:11.083 --> 39:12.750
Ancient astronaut theorists

39:12.875 --> 39:16.500
believe the answer can be found
at the Precious Metals Museum

39:16.667 --> 39:18.667
in La Paz, Bolivia.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.500
CHILDRESS: This is perhaps

39:20.667 --> 39:22.625
one of the most important
archaeological artifacts

39:22.750 --> 39:26.042
ever discovered in
Tiahuanaco or Puma Punku.

39:27.708 --> 39:31.167
This is the famous
Fuente Magna Bowl

39:31.333 --> 39:33.667
discovered near Tiahuanaco.

39:34.708 --> 39:38.458
It's a ceramic bowl
and it has written on it

39:38.542 --> 39:40.750
Sumerian cuneiform

39:40.875 --> 39:46.000
plus proto-Sumerian
hieroglyphic script.

39:46.083 --> 39:51.000
This script is
coming from circa 3,000 BC.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.958
It draws a direct connection

39:56.042 --> 40:01.042
between the ancient Sumerians
and Tiahuanaco and Puma Punku.

40:02.417 --> 40:06.958
NARRATOR:
Discovered near Lake Titicaca
by a local farmer in the 1950s,

40:07.083 --> 40:10.083
researchers believe
the vessel provides the proof

40:10.208 --> 40:14.000
of extraterrestrial
intervention at Puma Punku.

40:15.667 --> 40:17.042
CHILDRESS:
The idea of Sumerian

40:17.167 --> 40:21.750
writing being here
at Puma Punku and Tiahuanaco...

40:23.125 --> 40:26.208
...would seem
to relate to the late

40:26.333 --> 40:30.333
Zecharia Sitchin and his ideas

40:30.417 --> 40:33.958
that the Sumerians
were also interacting

40:34.083 --> 40:35.958
with these space beings

40:36.083 --> 40:38.042
called the Anunnaki.

40:38.167 --> 40:42.333
So in that case the Anunnaki
were there in Sumeria,

40:42.458 --> 40:48.167
but also here at Puma Punku
and Tiahuanaco in South America.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.458
To me, when you consider
the many mysterious artifacts

40:54.542 --> 40:56.625
we've examined
on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

40:56.708 --> 40:59.667
from bizarre metal alloys

40:59.750 --> 41:01.500
to strange statues

41:01.625 --> 41:03.500
and even crystal skulls,

41:03.583 --> 41:06.750
it all adds up to one thing:

41:06.875 --> 41:10.208
Undeniable evidence of
extraterrestrial visitation.

41:11.292 --> 41:13.250
As we continue to dig deeper

41:13.375 --> 41:16.750
and unearth more extraordinary
relics of the past,

41:16.875 --> 41:19.500
perhaps we will finally discover

41:19.625 --> 41:23.333
the key to reuniting
with our alien ancestors.
