WEBVTT

00:38.168 --> 00:40.605
I was sheriff of this county when I was 25.

00:40.649 --> 00:44.174
Hard to believe.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.829
Grandfather was a sheriff.
Father, too.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.700
Ranchers all.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.834
Working the land through times
flush and fallow.

00:55.011 --> 00:58.406
There's a natural order
to things.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.886
We know it in our bones.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.498
Jesus was a man,
not some bearded lady.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.456
And just as water
flows downhill,

01:05.500 --> 01:08.329
a husband is head
of his household.

01:08.372 --> 01:11.375
Under him, the woman abides.

01:12.507 --> 01:14.204
She holds her virtue close

01:14.248 --> 01:17.425
until that matrimonial
threshold is crossed,

01:17.468 --> 01:18.948
and then she opens to him,

01:18.991 --> 01:21.255
as the flower opens to the sun.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.560
And in exchange,

01:22.604 --> 01:25.389
the man shelters
and protects his female,

01:25.433 --> 01:28.218
as the sword has its sheath.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.829
Okay, but what I'm saying is, you...

01:32.570 --> 01:35.921
No. He only raises
his hand to her

01:35.965 --> 01:37.880
when she forgets her place
and acts the man.

01:37.923 --> 01:41.492
And-and then only
for instruction,

01:41.536 --> 01:45.453
never taking any pleasure
or satisfaction from the task.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.237
Whereas you, son,

01:47.281 --> 01:50.327
seem to have played
a Tommy Lee drum solo

01:50.371 --> 01:52.895
all over your missus's facade.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.637
- This-- I fell is all.
- Hey, quiet now.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.205
Sheriff's talking.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.599
Come here. Take comfort, dear.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.080
Daughter, these hard times
are over.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.864
All right?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.736
I'll see to your husband's
instruction myself.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.085
What 'struction?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.223
Now, be honest.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.529
Do you ever question
your man's supremacy

02:18.573 --> 02:20.183
when he speaks?

02:20.227 --> 02:22.577
Just when he drinks
or with the crank, you know?

02:22.620 --> 02:24.361
I try to stay out
of the way, but...

02:25.406 --> 02:27.234
Don't hurt him.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.540
We got three boys
who need a daddy. - Okay.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.152
Okay. Okay.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.770
Yeah.

02:41.813 --> 02:44.251
Thank you. You got any
of that huckleberry pie?

02:44.294 --> 02:46.949
-Sure.
- That's great.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.084
Lookit, dick cheese,
I know you...

02:52.128 --> 02:53.521
Quiet.

02:56.045 --> 02:59.483
Go home. Fix a meal.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.442
Pray on it before
you take the first bite.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.053
Forgiveness. Tend to his burns.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.098
Try to be deferential.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.666
Cater to his needs as a man
with your mouth

03:08.710 --> 03:10.407
in order to sow harmony.

03:10.451 --> 03:13.671
I'll come by in the morning,
see if the lesson stuck.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.066
Go on.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.328
Go.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
They missed her.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.929
What happened?

03:55.887 --> 04:00.196
You send a man to do a job without all the information,

04:00.240 --> 04:03.678
how can the job be done?

04:03.721 --> 04:05.027
Yeah, what are you?

04:05.984 --> 04:08.073
The Riddler?

04:08.117 --> 04:12.121
You say the woman
is a woman, a...

04:12.164 --> 04:13.992
How do you...?

04:14.036 --> 04:16.647
Housewife.

04:16.691 --> 04:22.697
Never do you mention
she is, for real, a tiger.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.700
You're saying you couldn't handle some girl?

04:25.743 --> 04:27.789
100 pounds soaking wet?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.705
Huh?

04:33.229 --> 04:36.798
It was on the wire this morning.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.323
This half-wit shot up a
filling station outside Beulah.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.194
Murdered the clerk.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.371
Killed a state trooper.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.850
Put a hole in the leg
of another.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.680
And this retard's partner
with a cracked skull

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
and his face half
burned off in the morgue.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.076
You say housewife,
so I bring one guy.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.513
You say tiger...

04:56.557 --> 04:57.688
that's a different guy.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.125
Cost you three times.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.824
Did they take her? The police?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.826
Fled on foot.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.219
Possibly home.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.960
Possibly to the wind.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.615
Could you find her?

05:11.659 --> 05:14.357
She could be found.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.317
Where people go,
the thoughts they have,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.884
these are known to me.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.103
Instincts.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.453
Who flees, who fights.

05:23.497 --> 05:27.762
It's a question of price.

05:27.805 --> 05:31.200
The job it was,
not the job you said.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.289
Pain and suffering.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.813
A man, missing an appendage,

05:35.857 --> 05:38.207
self-sewing his own skin.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.948
Scarred for life, he's told.

05:39.991 --> 05:43.473
And then this new ask.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.127
Hunting a tiger.

05:45.170 --> 05:48.086
And it forces the man to ask:

05:48.130 --> 05:50.872
why you want the tiger?

05:52.613 --> 05:54.310
She's my wife.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.616
Don't tell him shit.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.052
I already said
I can handle this.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.010
We know where she lives now.
Her alias.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.322
She made vows to me.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.063
A pledge.

06:08.106 --> 06:11.240
In sickness and in health.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.722
Consider it a debt unpaid,
leaving me in limbo.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.377
Husband yes or husband no.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.076
See, she hid from me
nine, ten years.

06:22.033 --> 06:25.472
Interest accrued.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.562
Until the debt could no longer
be paid with money.

06:32.479 --> 06:36.091
Then, one day, there she is,
fingerprints in the system.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.267
Now the limbo can end,

06:38.310 --> 06:41.226
the debt can be collected.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.448
Tell me something, friend.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.496
If a man is pure,

06:49.539 --> 06:52.281
his actions are only ever good.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.327
You believe that?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.941
I'm a nihilist.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.682
What the fuck does that mean?

07:01.725 --> 07:03.031
I believe in nothing.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.380
You believe in money.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.949
Yeah?

07:13.998 --> 07:16.436
Well, thanks for your help.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
Go on with Gator.
He'll get you paid.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.614
Dad.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.920
Original plus pain
and suffering.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.835
Yeah, of course.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.229
Take it out
of the rainy day fund.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.883
Fixing place.

07:28.926 --> 07:32.582
Fixing place. Right.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.584
Come on, numbnuts.

07:41.504 --> 07:45.769
A man is grateful.

08:00.784 --> 08:04.179
I'm not saying sorry,
but you understand.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.920
I had to rough you up a little
back there.

08:05.963 --> 08:09.010
You coming up
snake eyes and all.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.582
With her being
such a tiny bird, which...

08:18.280 --> 08:19.890
You know...

08:21.239 --> 08:23.677
they used to be dinosaurs.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.509
Hundreds okay?

08:40.432 --> 08:41.782
Surprise, shitbird.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.502
- What's going on, Roy?
- Go on, get back to the house now.

09:32.223 --> 09:36.097
Like we said, this is all just a misunderstanding.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.620
Had a bad day is all.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.192
A bad day?

09:44.235 --> 09:45.410
Yeah.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.587
Left the house a mess.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.720
Last I checked, weren't a crime.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.069
No, ma'am.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.158
I'm a recidivist
on that count myself.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.464
Laundry especially.

09:55.507 --> 09:58.293
Oh, laundry.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.904
But what I'm concerned
about is the blood.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.950
Told you, I cut my feet up
on some glass.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.516
You did.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.389
And I see the wounds.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.695
But what I'm dealing with
is the fact

10:08.738 --> 10:10.479
that the blood
on your entry floor

10:10.522 --> 10:12.176
is different than the blood type
we have on record for you.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.569
Records?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.745
Those...

10:15.789 --> 10:18.879
You know, I heard a man went
into the hospital in St. Paul

10:18.922 --> 10:20.881
fer a kidney transplant,

10:20.924 --> 10:22.578
he ended up
with someone else's brain.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.102
- No way.
- Yeah.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.321
Well, I'm not sure...

10:26.364 --> 10:28.802
That don't sound accurate.

10:28.845 --> 10:32.544
What I'm saying is,
hospitals make mistakes.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.460
Then there's the hair DNA from
the balaclava in your boudoir.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.288
Told you, I bought
that secondhand.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.730
You know, it's my fault.

10:43.773 --> 10:47.298
You know, I came home,
front door was wide open, uh,

10:47.342 --> 10:49.736
all the... blood.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.956
Uh, I-I'm not ashamed
to say I panicked.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.566
But, you know, Dot's home,

10:54.610 --> 10:56.438
and, uh, that's all
that matters.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.745
So, uh, whatever the--

10:58.788 --> 11:01.573
You know, she's my wife.
And I believe her.

11:01.617 --> 11:05.273
So, if there's a form
or something I can sign to...

11:05.316 --> 11:08.232
you know, drop the charges...

11:08.276 --> 11:10.147
That's not how this works.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.805
- I got to...
- Hmm?

11:15.849 --> 11:17.938
It's almost time for pickup.

11:17.981 --> 11:22.159
I told Scotty we could
go to DQ after school, so...

11:25.554 --> 11:27.382
Well, okay, then.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.949
Thanks for your time.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.690
Mm-hmm.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.517
We're reviewing traffic cameras
in the neighborhood,

11:32.561 --> 11:33.475
so if I have
any more questions...

11:33.518 --> 11:34.955
No.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.044
She's...

11:37.087 --> 11:39.699
Wayne, she's not
listening to me.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.875
Uh, Danish Graves
is our attorney,

11:41.918 --> 11:43.877
so if you need
to contact us again,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.575
which you shouldn't, uh...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.447
Okay, then.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.244
So, it's a puzzler.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.811
Spoke to Wayne.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.638
Dot's back.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.205
She's what now?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.251
Yeah, came home on her own.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.209
A little bruised.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.734
Bloody feet.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.257
She escaped?

12:16.300 --> 12:17.432
Well, that's the conundrum.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.086
Says she wasn't taken.

12:19.129 --> 12:22.176
Says it was just a driving
around type scenario.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.612
Getting her head straight.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.570
Bullshit.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.312
You saw the police report.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.053
Something's fishy here.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.229
Agreed.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.927
I smell a rat.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.190
You think...

12:36.233 --> 12:37.582
Well, what do you think?

12:37.626 --> 12:40.890
A play, maybe.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.588
Extortion,
but she got cold feet.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.242
Kidnapped herself,
you're thinking?

12:45.286 --> 12:48.550
I mean, what do we know
about this girl, really?

12:48.593 --> 12:51.074
Well, I did the background check
when they got engaged.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.946
Well, you said yourself,
not much there.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.382
Pretty thin, for sure.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.905
Just the birth certificate,

12:55.949 --> 12:57.689
a few school records,
previous addresses.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.822
Well, it's too good to be true,
now I'm thinking.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.693
So, what do we...?

13:01.737 --> 13:05.349
Tell you what we don't want--
police digging their noses

13:05.393 --> 13:06.742
into other people's business.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.483
Asking questions
that can't be answered.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.789
Then what?

13:11.225 --> 13:13.618
Possibly this thing
goes federal.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.664
You know, wrong person
makes a phone call.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.580
You don't think Wayne's...

13:18.623 --> 13:21.061
Who knows what to think?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.150
He's got the dealership,

13:23.193 --> 13:26.022
a decent roof over their head,

13:26.066 --> 13:31.071
but maybe she's pushing him
for more.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.682
Putting ideas in his head.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.337
Eh... I don't know.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.601
So we separate 'em,
like the cops.

13:39.644 --> 13:42.299
You brace him. I go at her.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.388
Get to the bottom of things.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.912
If this deal's for real

13:45.955 --> 13:48.610
and they got a notion
to take what's mine,

13:48.653 --> 13:50.960
we need to nip it in the bud.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.570
Keep things in-house.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.964
Ah, geez.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.575
Everything was going
along just fine, too.

13:57.619 --> 13:58.881
And now, what do you...

13:58.925 --> 14:02.711
This... enemy within situation.

14:02.754 --> 14:06.846
She made promises. To me.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.499
My son.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.198
To have and to hold.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.765
For richer and poorer.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.334
And that's a debt
we're gonna collect.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.574

at seven, yeah ♪

14:39.617 --> 14:43.317

15:25.663 --> 15:27.752
You gonna make it
there, sunshine?

15:27.796 --> 15:31.887
Fucker got the drop
on me.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.239
Tell me her name again?

15:36.283 --> 15:39.808
Uh, goes by Dorothy Lyon now.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.897
Lives in a suburb outside
the Twin Cities.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.377
Married, you said?

15:43.420 --> 15:44.987
Going on ten years.

15:45.031 --> 15:48.077
Husband owns a car dealership,
some kind of...

15:48.121 --> 15:50.079
uh, Korean model.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.385
Koreans make cars?

15:51.428 --> 15:53.691
I guess.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.041
Anyway, she's got a daughter

15:55.084 --> 15:57.869
named Scotty. She's about nine.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.706
Roy, we got FBI here.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.756
Let's send 'em up.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.324
What do you want me to...?

16:17.367 --> 16:18.499
Ah, don't worry about it.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.335
Hard day at the office.

16:28.378 --> 16:31.033
Like the sign says,
he's a hard man for hard times.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.340
And by "he" I mean me.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.913
Agent "Ja-Queen."

16:41.957 --> 16:44.177
It's Joaquin.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.656
This is Agent Meyer.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.093
We're new in the Fargo office.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.572
We thought we'd come by,

16:48.616 --> 16:50.748
see why you aren't enforcing
any of our laws.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.359
What laws?

16:52.402 --> 16:54.100
Oh, you know, gun laws, drug laws.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.754
Any of the half-dozen
other American laws

16:56.798 --> 16:58.887
passed and ratified
by the United States government

16:58.930 --> 17:01.411
that you don't seem
to recognize.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.413
Well, Agent Ja-Queen,
I think you'll find

17:03.457 --> 17:05.459
that there is no one
on God's green earth

17:05.502 --> 17:06.938
who is a greater enforcer
of the laws of this land

17:06.982 --> 17:08.418
than Roy Tillman.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.507
Why do I feel like
there's a "but" here?

17:10.551 --> 17:11.639
But...

17:13.423 --> 17:17.601
...what you need to know is
that I amthe law of the land.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.387
Elected by the residents
of this county

17:20.430 --> 17:22.519
to interpret and enforce
the Constitution

17:22.563 --> 17:26.001
given unto us by Almighty God.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.829
Mm-hmm.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.787
Freedom.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.311
Amen.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.617
You know, I hear that word
a lot out here.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.228
I'm curious...

17:35.271 --> 17:37.056
what you think it means.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.796
Agent, if you don't know
what freedom is,

17:38.840 --> 17:40.102
I don't think me saying
the words out loud

17:40.146 --> 17:41.886
is gonna teach you.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.630
Why don't you go
and do your chores?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.772
Seriously?

17:58.990 --> 18:00.818
Do you want a towel, or...?

18:00.862 --> 18:02.820
Does my discussing
matters of state

18:02.864 --> 18:05.171
in moist repose bother you?

18:14.832 --> 18:16.356
Jesus.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.499
Now, what is it
you wanted to discuss?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.501
Well, like I said, we're new in town.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.069
We thought we'd come open
a collegial dialogue.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
Maybe let you know
we're looking into the practices

18:36.158 --> 18:38.682
- of your office.
- Very unorthodox practices.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.597
Possibly illegal.

18:40.641 --> 18:44.166
Illegal according to who?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.385
Maybe you weren't
paying attention,

18:45.428 --> 18:46.908
but I am the law around here.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.953
So you said.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.695
Removable only by the governor
or my constituents,

18:51.739 --> 18:53.306
who love me, by the way,

18:53.349 --> 18:56.178
because I say what I want
and I do as I please.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.006
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.008
Don't you mean legal
and illegal?

19:02.532 --> 19:04.491
Well...

19:04.534 --> 19:06.928
did you know that
in North Dakota it is illegal

19:06.971 --> 19:08.277
for a charitable group to hold

19:08.321 --> 19:11.498
more than two poker games
a year?

19:11.541 --> 19:14.283
And similarly, it is illegal

19:14.327 --> 19:16.633
to keep an elk in a sandbox
in your own backyard.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.940
I shit you not.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.594
Now, if you were to own a tavern

19:20.637 --> 19:22.509
and serve beer and pretzels
at the same time,

19:22.552 --> 19:23.510
I could arrest you.

19:23.553 --> 19:26.077
And in Waverly...

19:26.121 --> 19:31.213
the law forbids horses
from sleeping in bathtubs.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.563
You beginning to get
the drift here?

19:35.043 --> 19:37.567
I'm a sheriff
of the American Constitution.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.657
Bound by duty, blood,
and tradition

19:40.701 --> 19:44.095
to enforce what is right
and to prosecute what is wrong.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.185
And the law, my friends...

19:47.186 --> 19:49.057
...has very little
to do with it.

19:51.233 --> 19:55.106
So, Ja-Queen, Mrs. Ja-Queen,

19:55.150 --> 19:57.152
if you'll excuse me,

19:57.196 --> 19:58.980
I have some justice
to administer.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.070
You can see yourself out.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.832
What do you say next time
we get an extra Blizzard

20:24.875 --> 20:27.487
and hold it upside down
to see how long it takes

20:27.530 --> 20:29.228
for the stuffing
to come out, huh?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.754
Your tea selection is atrocious.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.756
How did you get in here?

20:39.890 --> 20:41.240
Hey, Nana.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.113
Are you wearing lipstick?

20:45.156 --> 20:47.071
That's ketchup.
We had curly fries.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.469
Like I said, how come
you're in my home?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.471
Of course I have a key.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.952
It's my son's house.

20:57.995 --> 21:01.390
Still, sorry if-if
we startled you.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.131
Imagine intruders breaking
into your house

21:03.174 --> 21:05.699
twice in one week.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.831
Oh, wait.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.226
That didn't happen.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.403
What do you want?

21:16.318 --> 21:19.887
Jerome, could you see
my granddaughter to her room?

21:19.930 --> 21:22.368
Maybe she wants to show you
her dolls.

21:22.411 --> 21:25.849
I don't have dolls, Nana.
I like ninjas.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.590
Is that some kind of cat?

21:27.634 --> 21:28.939
You're silly.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.464
Come on, young Skywalker.

21:31.507 --> 21:35.511
I'll show you how
a true samurai fights, hmm?

21:35.555 --> 21:38.514
Whoa.

21:43.345 --> 21:47.871
Well, I guess with you
when it rains it pours.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.656
That...

21:51.875 --> 21:55.749
I mean, this is all
just a bunch of silliness.

21:55.792 --> 21:59.361
Honestly, I'm embarrassed
by all the fuss.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.276
Signs of a break-in, I'm told.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.758
Evidence you fought back,
which good for you.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.760
I'd have skinned 'em
where they stood.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.718
Please.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.503
More like Mama had a tantrum

22:10.546 --> 22:12.940
and it all got blowed
out of proportion.

22:12.983 --> 22:16.378
Honestly, like a snowball
rolling downhill.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.816
Well, either you got
a screw loose,

22:19.860 --> 22:23.559
or somebody came for you
and you got away...

22:23.603 --> 22:25.169
and now you're lying about it.

22:25.213 --> 22:26.997
Mom.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.217
No.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.175
I'm not your mom.

22:31.219 --> 22:34.875
You're married to my son,
mother to my granddaughter.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.268
I wanted a girl with papers,

22:37.312 --> 22:39.880
but my Wayne always
liked a sassy thing

22:39.923 --> 22:42.361
with a tight caboose,
so here you are.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.280
Haven't you ever had
one of those days?

22:51.674 --> 22:55.025
So what if I do got
a screw loose?

22:55.069 --> 22:57.680
Stress and the like.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.640
I'm holding up my end
of the deal.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.424
We're man and wife,

23:02.468 --> 23:04.513
him and me,

23:04.557 --> 23:05.906
and he loves me.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.517
There are ways
we could change that.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.345
The holy bond.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.652
Revocation of the trust.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.175
And cut you both
out of the will,

23:14.218 --> 23:15.698
see if that moves the marker.

23:15.742 --> 23:16.960
What are you saying?

23:17.004 --> 23:19.398
I'm saying I don't trust you.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.008
You're up to something.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.924
And I won't have you
dragging my son down.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.578
So...

23:25.621 --> 23:27.275
best you make excuses,

23:27.318 --> 23:31.714
you go back to wherever it is
you were before you met.

23:31.758 --> 23:36.502
If you go easy, I could
even see my way to...

23:36.545 --> 23:41.420
staking you
for the first... two years.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.814
Listen, bitch.

23:46.381 --> 23:50.516
I've climbed through six kinds
of hell to get where I am.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.432
And no Ivy League royal wannabe
is gonna run me off

23:53.475 --> 23:55.434
just because she doesn't
like the way I smell.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.613
If you want to tussle with me...

24:00.656 --> 24:04.878
...you better sleep
with both eyes open.

24:04.921 --> 24:09.883
Because nobody takes
what's mine and lives.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.152
Anyhoo...

24:18.195 --> 24:20.110
thanks for stopping by.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.461
Dinner Sunday?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.986
I'll bring my blue salad.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.206
Jerome.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.121
We're leaving.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.997
Always nice to see you, dear.

24:39.042 --> 24:43.003
Maybe think about getting
some iron into your diet.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.135
You look like a corpse.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.137
Mom?

25:30.180 --> 25:31.921
Ooh.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.622
I'm hungry.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.449
What?

25:38.493 --> 25:40.277
You just had DQ.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.236
It didn't take.

25:42.279 --> 25:45.065
Oh. What's going on down there?

25:45.108 --> 25:46.675
A wedgie.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.116
Tell you what.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.945
How about we make
a vegetable medley

25:55.989 --> 25:59.688
with carrot sticks
and the bell peppers you like?

25:59.732 --> 26:02.735
And then you can help Mom
do some kind of craft project.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.475
What kind of craft project?

26:04.519 --> 26:07.827
You're gonna have to go
downstairs to find out.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.873
Come on.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.192
Ah! Bye-bye.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.716
Nice done.

getting smooshed like a bug.

28:01.636 --> 28:04.204
Can we do my room next?

28:04.247 --> 28:06.293
Oh, yeah.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.903
Let's go.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.600
Race you.

28:14.431 --> 28:19.088
Don't forget our special 30% off winter deal on...

28:19.132 --> 28:22.309
Great deal, heck of a deal.

28:22.352 --> 28:25.747
Oh, sure, yeah, I got
those VIN numbers right here.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.491
Actually, Phil,
I'll have to call you back.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.015
All right.

28:33.059 --> 28:35.191
Finally saw the light
on that Porsche, did you?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.934
What are you, uh...?

28:38.978 --> 28:41.589
- What are you...?
- I got some business to discuss, Wayne.

28:41.632 --> 28:42.851
Ah.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.985
Is he on?

28:46.028 --> 28:47.595
Mom?

28:47.638 --> 28:49.466
Got a problem here, kid.
Need your help with it.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.641
Of course, yeah.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.339
Is it that landscaper again?

28:52.382 --> 28:54.297
No, it's not
the landscaper, moron.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.386
It's your wife.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.693
Now hold on.
That's, uh...

28:58.737 --> 29:01.087
This whole kidnapping
that ain't a kidnapping thing,

29:01.130 --> 29:03.089
well, there's something
fishy about that.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.352
Full low tide, if you ask me.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.657
Like the dog's breath.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.529
Now, we talked about this, uh...

29:08.572 --> 29:10.139
She had a bad day.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.401
Son.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.968
I talked to the police.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.231
They got hard evidence
your wife was abducted.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.146
Not to mention,

29:17.190 --> 29:19.148
I just learned they think
they got one of the guys

29:19.192 --> 29:21.890
on a slab over in North Dakota.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.545
Broke his skull in the commode
of a filling station.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.549
- G-Geez.
- Yeah, officer on the scene said

29:28.592 --> 29:31.247
there was a female present
who matches Dot.

29:31.291 --> 29:35.599
Get your head
out of your ass, kid.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.906
She's making a play here,
your missus.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.429
In cahoots with
the kidnappers maybe,

29:39.473 --> 29:43.129
or maybe just seizing
the opportunity.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.565
I'm not sure what or why.

29:44.608 --> 29:45.740
But any way you tell the story,

29:45.784 --> 29:47.698
it ends with me writing a check.

29:47.742 --> 29:51.093
Oh, come on now, Ma,
n-not everything's about money.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.269
Slap him.

29:53.313 --> 29:56.403
I'm... sorry?

29:56.446 --> 29:57.534
You heard me.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.101
My son needs a slap

29:59.145 --> 30:00.581
and I'm not there
to give it to him.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.930
So, as my attorney,
I authorize you

30:01.974 --> 30:04.237
to knock his fucking block off.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.373
No.

30:12.245 --> 30:13.159
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.725
Wait a minute-- Aah!

30:16.640 --> 30:17.859
Ow.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.426
Listen to me, boy.

30:19.469 --> 30:21.341
You're back at the kiddie table
on this one.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.169
That's official.

30:23.212 --> 30:26.389
Now shut your hole
and listen to me talk.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.877
Trooper?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.792
Saved.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.794
From what?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.796
Concord grape, I think.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.016
Hmm.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.845
How... may I help you?

30:46.888 --> 30:48.455
Sure, well,
I'm, uh, Deputy Olmstead,

30:48.498 --> 30:50.239
Scandia Police Department
over in Minnesota.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.719
I wanted to ask you
some questions

30:51.762 --> 30:53.068
about events that transpired
last night.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.896
You and everybody else.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.985
Well, sir, I think I might have
a piece of your puzzle.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.814
To wit, the identity of
the missing female you assisted.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.209
If I'm right,
which I think I am.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.341
Color me intrigued.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.735
Taken from her home yesterday
afternoon by two men, we think.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.519
We found blood from one.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.087
Looks like she burned the other
fella's face pretty bad.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.697
Sounds like my girl.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.221
Rambo, basically.

31:15.264 --> 31:19.399
Or, uh, the other fella
from the TV, uh...

31:19.442 --> 31:21.749
- MacGyver.
- Well, I got a picture.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.881
Mm.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.318
What do you know?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.277
It's a party.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.845
Indira Olmstead, Scandia Police Department.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.195
Ah. City girl.

31:33.239 --> 31:35.197
Well, we prefer "women"
these days.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.156
But the rest is accurate.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.592
How can we help you, stranger?

31:38.635 --> 31:42.335
Sheriff's Deputy, Stark County.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.990
Sounds like you had a mix-up in
my neck of the woods last night,

31:45.033 --> 31:48.036
which we run a pretty
tight ship, so...

31:48.080 --> 31:49.995
I take it personal
when bad men appear.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.258
This job will grind you down,
you take it too personal.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.914
What can I say? I like being
on the right side of a gunfight.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.916
Heard you say you had
a picture of the perps?

31:57.959 --> 32:00.831
- Uh, victim. Female.
-Right.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.574
Saw something about, uh,
a woman got taken.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.925
Or escaped or something?

32:06.968 --> 32:09.318
We think these fellas grabbed
her up in Minnesota.

32:09.362 --> 32:12.060
Taking her to points west when
the trooper pulled them over.

32:12.104 --> 32:14.628
She killed one,
the recidivist Donald Ireland,

32:14.671 --> 32:17.761
I think they said.
The other one got away.

32:17.805 --> 32:21.069
Sounds like a real Comanche,
this female you're hunting.

32:21.113 --> 32:24.899
Like I said, I got a photo.
Excuse me.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.989
So, what, she some kind of criminal, also?

32:28.033 --> 32:29.556
Not exactly.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.862
Had a mix-up at her daughter's
school this week.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.299
Tased an officer by accident.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.735
How's that happen?

32:34.778 --> 32:36.215
Heat of the moment,
I'm guessing.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.520
Used to be a saying:

32:37.564 --> 32:40.393
"Minnesota nice."
But I was there.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.656
Nothing nice about Minnesota
that day.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.658
Oops. What'd I do?

32:44.701 --> 32:47.182
- What did you...?
- I must've, I don't know, I pressed something.

32:47.226 --> 32:50.316
Darn it, you deleted
the victim, her photo.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.188
Yeah, me and technology
don't see eye to eye.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.537
Especially now.

32:54.581 --> 32:57.018
This wrist-breaker... ah.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.238
No, it-it's my fault.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.414
I'm not sure what I was thinking
just bringing the one.

33:01.457 --> 33:04.025
Well, I sure hope you find her.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.375
If it was her,
saved my life, I think.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.074
Oh, no, she's home.
A little worse for wear

33:09.117 --> 33:10.379
but intact.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.598
Strangest thing, though.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.295
Despite all evidence,

33:13.339 --> 33:15.210
she's claiming
it never happened.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.299
Never... what now?

33:17.343 --> 33:18.866
Says nobody broke in.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.520
Says she wasn't taken.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.087
Just went for a wander
for ten hours

33:22.130 --> 33:24.263
and then came home
and cooked breakfast.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.134
Cry for attention, sounds like.

33:26.178 --> 33:29.572
Drama queen trying to make
her husband sick.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.226
Who said she has a husband?

33:31.270 --> 33:32.880
No, I mean, I'm assuming.

33:32.923 --> 33:35.926
Description said 30s
in the police report, so...

33:35.970 --> 33:37.624
Well, all I know is,
the woman I met broke loose

33:37.667 --> 33:40.192
like somebody who knows
how small the cage can get.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.369
Wish you had that picture.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.371
Like to meet
that woman again, thank her.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.373
For what? Far as I can tell,

33:47.416 --> 33:49.375
she's the one got you shot
in the first place.

33:49.418 --> 33:51.420
Oh, the job got me shot.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.509
She was just...

33:53.553 --> 33:55.685
trying to get free.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.339
But you know what they say.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.558
Protect and serve.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.084
Yeah, I'm down
with "protect," but...

34:03.128 --> 34:04.738
I ain't in the service industry.

34:04.781 --> 34:08.611
I'm in the kicking ass
and taking names business.

34:17.446 --> 34:19.057
You two have a nice day.

34:38.902 --> 34:41.079
Consider that bitch flummoxed.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.374
What the heck?

35:15.417 --> 35:17.202
Hiya, hon.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.032
What the heck?

35:22.076 --> 35:23.730
Made some shepherd's pie.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.216
Scotty.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.609
What you doing there?

35:33.653 --> 35:35.655
For security. Mom said.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.396
- Yeah.
-Oh.

35:37.439 --> 35:38.440
Hon...

35:38.484 --> 35:41.226
Yeah?

35:41.269 --> 35:43.793
Why is there a sledgehammer
over the front door?

35:43.837 --> 35:46.405
Well, we talked
about an alarm system,

35:46.448 --> 35:49.930
but you said we couldn't
afford a good one, so we...

35:49.973 --> 35:51.714
Well, what the heck is...?

35:51.758 --> 35:53.325
Oh, no, hon, I wouldn't touch
that. It's electrified.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.761
It's what?

35:54.804 --> 35:56.719
It's plugged into the wall.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.591
Anyone tries to bust in,

35:58.634 --> 36:00.636
well, they'll get
a righteous shock.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.036
Hon, c-can we talk? I...

36:09.079 --> 36:12.300
Wait, how, I'm just gonna...

36:12.344 --> 36:13.910
How about you go upstairs
and, uh,

36:13.954 --> 36:16.696
watch some cartoons
on your Samsung?

36:16.739 --> 36:19.002
Yeah?

36:21.701 --> 36:24.573
- Yeah.
- Let me get my apron off at least.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.536
Uh, Mom came by the lot today.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.452
Er, well, her man did.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.888
Uh, she called in.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.716
Yeah, she...

36:36.759 --> 36:38.500
I saw her, too.

36:38.544 --> 36:39.980
But don't worry.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.069
I think we came
to an understanding.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.679
She said that, or...?

36:43.723 --> 36:45.681
- No.
- Oh.

36:45.725 --> 36:49.032
But women understand each other.

36:49.076 --> 36:52.122
Well, hon, I don't
think you do...

36:52.166 --> 36:55.213
u-understand each other.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.737
She... She's litigating
against you, see.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.479
She, uh...

37:00.522 --> 37:02.785
Well, she thinks
you made this whole thing up.

37:02.829 --> 37:06.746
I... I mean, the whole
thing sounds... loony.

37:06.789 --> 37:10.445
But she-she thinks you're
some kind of con woman.

37:10.489 --> 37:13.187
Uh, playing us for our money.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.971
Uh, in league
with the kidnappers.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.495
I just...

37:16.538 --> 37:20.281
Told you, there were
no kidnappers, just...

37:20.325 --> 37:21.804
Drove around
to-to clear your head.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.850
But-but, hon, the-the...

37:23.893 --> 37:25.765
The-the car was here
the whole time.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.070
Walking, I said, or I-I...

37:27.114 --> 37:28.550
Listen, I believe you.

37:28.594 --> 37:31.292
I'm not the one
you got to... I just...

37:31.336 --> 37:33.033
And she said she can get
the cops out of the equation.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.689
You know, her friend the
attorney general, but, hon...

37:36.732 --> 37:39.082
You know, from-from where she's
sitting the-the whole thing

37:39.126 --> 37:40.780
don't make a lot of sense.

37:44.610 --> 37:47.047
But it makes sense to us.

37:48.048 --> 37:49.832
That's what matters, right?

37:49.876 --> 37:53.140
Yeah, maybe.

37:53.183 --> 37:57.753
But, hon... wh-why-why is there
a, a-a sledgehammer

37:57.797 --> 37:59.451
in the vestibule?

37:59.494 --> 38:02.280
A-And how come Scotty's
making a zombie killer?

38:02.323 --> 38:05.195
Well, like she said. Security.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.414
From what?

38:06.458 --> 38:07.850
Hon...

38:07.894 --> 38:09.591
No, I-I'm just trying
to, you know...

38:09.635 --> 38:13.421
No. You can't.
You-you weren't there.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.944
At the school board.

38:15.945 --> 38:19.035
Neighbor against neighbor.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.602
Society's breaking down here.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.300
The social structure.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.259
What side you're on,
whether you're for or against,

38:25.303 --> 38:28.871
I-I'm just saying...

38:30.090 --> 38:31.657
We need to wake up here.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.137
Protect ourselves, in case...

38:34.181 --> 38:35.922
In case what?

38:35.965 --> 38:38.272
In case...

38:38.316 --> 38:40.970
ruffians at the door.

38:41.014 --> 38:44.147
Or Mr. Abernathy decides
he wants revenge.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.019
Or a thousand other maybes.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.673
Uh, who?

38:47.716 --> 38:49.109
Scotty's math teacher.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.415
The fella I tased
before the cop.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.938
Y-You tased the math teacher?

38:51.981 --> 38:53.679
Well...

38:53.722 --> 38:55.550
I got a bad feeling, hon.

38:55.594 --> 38:57.552
- Yeah.
- People do.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.293
It's not just me.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.861
And I'm, I-I'm not saying
that we should build a bunker.

39:01.904 --> 39:05.038
Or stockpile long guns.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.605
A few common sense...

39:06.648 --> 39:09.738
Hon, y-y-y-you got electric wire
on the windows.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.174
A few practical solutions.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.046
Unless you're ready to step up

39:13.089 --> 39:16.963
and go state of the art, really
sink some capital into it.

39:17.006 --> 39:20.314
I-I... Should we, I don't know,
sh-sh-sh-should we get a gun?

39:20.358 --> 39:24.100
See? Oh. Now you're thinking.

39:24.144 --> 39:26.799
A gun is a great idea.
We should get a shotgun.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.583
- Oh.
- And maybe a pistol for the bedroom.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.238
- Ah.
- And maybe we could replace my Taser, too.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.980
And, I don't know,
maybe some kind of net.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.374
- Just in case they, uh...
- A net?

39:36.417 --> 39:37.375
- Huh?
- Huh?

39:37.418 --> 39:38.767
All I'm saying is-is,

39:38.811 --> 39:40.900
now we're speaking
the same language.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.687
Oh, you're such a gentle guy.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.036
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.387
I know how hard this is.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.390
I-I just want to play
floor hockey

39:52.433 --> 39:55.697
in my socks with Scotty again
and watch Real Housewives.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.177
I know.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.746
And we can and we will.

40:00.789 --> 40:05.054
Hey. We just got to take care
of a few things first.

40:11.365 --> 40:14.020
All I ever wanted was...

40:15.064 --> 40:17.806
Y-You're my dream come true.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.986
And you're mine.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.560
Come on, mister.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.780
Before your daughter's brain
turns to sludge.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.782
Yeah.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.479
