WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:07.125
Yes!

00:13.708 --> 00:16.125
I know we haven't been a team
for very long,

00:16.207 --> 00:18.500
but we've fought
some pretty major bad guys.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.667
So a little Fire Viper
shouldn't be a problem.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.083
Definitely not!

00:23.167 --> 00:25.250
Though I do take issue
with the word "little"--

00:26.667 --> 00:30.000
Eh! It's just a super-sized
fire-breathing snake. I got this!

00:34.750 --> 00:36.083
Or not.

00:36.167 --> 00:38.958
Looks like you're outmatched
in the fire department.

00:39.042 --> 00:41.500
Luckily,
I can handle this guy with my speed.

00:48.333 --> 00:51.208
-Or not.
-Yo, pal! I'm gonna use my--

00:53.375 --> 00:55.750
Or not.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.917
Or not.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.917
Or not.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.333
Magma.

01:03.417 --> 01:05.583
Wah, wah!

01:05.667 --> 01:06.958
Magma, indeed.

01:07.042 --> 01:10.375
I've never assembled
a Skylander team who's failed

01:10.458 --> 01:13.375
the Fire Viper Training Simulation
this many times.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.083
But cheer up, gang.

01:15.167 --> 01:18.458
You should be proud
you set a record for something!

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.625 --> 01:54.625
Come on, Spyro!

01:54.708 --> 01:57.542
That Fire Viper Simulation is
the most basic one.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.625
I mean, it's the only monster
we could actually run into

01:59.708 --> 02:01.458
without even leaving the academy.

02:01.542 --> 02:04.708
Totally. If we can't even beat that,
we're not much of a team.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.958
Oh. Hey. I... thought I was the only one
who came here to think deep thoughts.

02:09.042 --> 02:13.250
Really? 'Cause it's kind of the only
serene, contemplative spot on the isle.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.750
- Totally.
- Yep.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.542
What she said. I've actually been
coming here since I was a cadet.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.750
And the clouds really help me focus.

02:19.833 --> 02:23.750
Like that one that's shaped
like a Fire Viper!

02:23.833 --> 02:26.708
Well, I'm glad everyone is as thoughtful
and self-reflective as,

02:26.791 --> 02:28.750
up until now,
I thought only I was.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.458
Well, thinking
about the Fire Viper Simulation

02:31.542 --> 02:35.375
isn't beating the Fire Viper Simulation,
so, what are we gonna do?

02:35.458 --> 02:37.792
I might have an idea about that.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.208
I have things
to think about too, you know.

02:40.292 --> 02:44.167
Like what to do now that Kaos knows
the location of the Core of Light.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.125
Ooh, that is a thinker.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.375
But uh, if you had a plan to help us beat
the Fire Viper Simulation,

02:49.458 --> 02:50.875
maybe we could do that first, huh?

02:54.542 --> 02:58.917
Skylanders, I am concerned
Kaos' increasing plots and schemes suggest

02:59.000 --> 03:00.708
a growing darkness in our realm.

03:00.792 --> 03:04.708
So I've asked one of my oldest allies,
Sensei King Pen,

03:04.792 --> 03:08.458
to help me deal with it.
But... I believe he can help you, too.

03:08.542 --> 03:12.833
Long ago, Master Eon and I fought
side by side against a great foe.

03:12.917 --> 03:14.917
It was a difficult battle
that we nearly lost.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.542
After which we vowed to do
whatever we could to protect the Skylands.

03:18.625 --> 03:21.250
While I founded the academy...

03:21.333 --> 03:23.083
- I went to work on this.
- A box?

03:23.167 --> 03:27.042
What? Is it not a box?

03:27.125 --> 03:30.458
While I have been training Skylanders
these many years,

03:30.542 --> 03:33.958
King Pen has been working to assemble
a protector of the realm

03:34.042 --> 03:35.750
with unlimited skills and abilities.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.333
One who could operate
as a one-man wrecking crew

03:38.417 --> 03:41.500
when Skylanders are unable to answer
a call to arms.

03:41.583 --> 03:45.625
So it's, like...
some sort of robot Skylander?

03:45.708 --> 03:49.875
"Robot" is merely one of the many
physical manifestations of this being.

03:50.500 --> 03:54.375
I've created my own Skylander,
if you will... Or as I call him, Cy.

03:54.958 --> 03:57.875
Now it is up to all of you to venture
inside the trunk

03:57.958 --> 03:59.792
and construct your new teammate.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.750
-We get to build him?
-You get to create him.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.958
By using your imagination, you will choose
the appendages and powers

04:06.042 --> 04:08.625
for your creation that speak to you
above all others.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.417
To that end, you will need this.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.708
The Creation Crystal.
When all of you put your hands on it,

04:15.792 --> 04:19.458
it will take you to the imagination space
where your Imaginator will be born.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.167
You'll go in the box.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.708
Skylanders, touch the crystal.

04:26.042 --> 04:29.542
Huh. Nothing's happening.
Maybe your crystal is broken, King Pen.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.083
-Where are we?
-Ah!

04:36.167 --> 04:39.375
I think King Pen called it
the imagination space?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.583
I wanted to go in the box.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.667
We are in the box, Eruptor.
Well, so to speak.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.958
-The box is the imagination space.
-So, uh, what do we do now?

04:49.042 --> 04:54.208
I guess we think about what we want
our new Skylander to look like.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.583
Uh... a banana head?

04:59.667 --> 05:03.917
-What's wrong with a banana head?
-This is your idea of a new teammate, Pop?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.542
-Uh... Maybe?
-Okay, we've got the head.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.000
Let's imagine what else we want for Cy!

05:17.250 --> 05:19.000
Wow!

05:19.083 --> 05:24.083
Well, now, this is, uh...
something, isn't it?

05:24.167 --> 05:28.542
Unorthodox, for sure. But if this is
what the Skylanders imagined,

05:28.625 --> 05:31.375
then this is surely the teammate
they need to join them.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.125
So, did we do it wrong?

05:33.208 --> 05:36.625
There is no right or wrong, Pop Fizz.
Only what is or is not.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.083
So... that's a yes or--

05:39.167 --> 05:41.167
Cy should've come to life by now.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.208
His design is such that once he is
fully assembled, he would just--

05:44.292 --> 05:46.375
I'm the real peel!

05:46.458 --> 05:47.875
Sorry, that's my catchphrase
with this head!

05:47.958 --> 05:51.375
Catchphrase. Like a Skylander
needs something like that

05:51.458 --> 05:53.958
- to get all fired up.
- Right, guys?

05:54.042 --> 05:56.917
Hi! My name is...
Wait, do I have a name?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.125
He called you Cy.
So... what are you exactly?

06:00.208 --> 06:02.958
In theory, Cy is the missing link
you all need

06:03.042 --> 06:05.208
to overcome your recent shortcomings
as a team.

06:05.292 --> 06:08.750
To wit, he will be joining the Skylanders
for this purpose.

06:08.833 --> 06:12.583
This will be his first field test to see
if he can do just that for your team,

06:12.667 --> 06:15.458
-and others that follow in the future.
-Oh, cool!

06:15.542 --> 06:18.000
New team member with a banana head?
I can dig it.

06:18.083 --> 06:21.000
- Is your head edible?
- Let's find out!

06:21.083 --> 06:22.167
Simmer down, Pop.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.375
Look, now I'll be the first to admit

06:24.458 --> 06:26.750
the team is going through
some growing pains of late,

06:26.833 --> 06:30.208
but Cy hasn't graduated from
or even trained at the academy.

06:30.292 --> 06:32.917
How do we know
he'll be up to actual Skylandering?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.125
Cy is designed to learn
any skill or ability a Skylander can.

06:36.208 --> 06:37.583
So he can do anything?

06:37.667 --> 06:42.125
Guys! Cy could be what we've been missing
to finally beat the Fire Viper Simulation!

06:42.208 --> 06:45.917
We shall see.
Now while you and Cy train together,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.250
King Pen and I also have
some important work to do.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.750
So what do we do next, Skyfriends?

06:50.833 --> 06:53.833
First things first.
A very important question...

06:53.917 --> 06:56.500
How do you keep your banana head
from turning brown?

07:04.875 --> 07:07.208
- Glumshanks!
- You bellowed, sir?

07:07.292 --> 07:10.875
I am trying to make a copy of the map
to the Core of Light,

07:10.958 --> 07:14.375
but I can't maintain the projection
and draw at the same time.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.667
Thank goodness
you're not also trying to chew gum, sir.

07:16.750 --> 07:21.542
I need a faster quill... or a quicker
parchment... or... Ooh, I know!

07:21.625 --> 07:24.792
I'll project it
and you copy it down, Glummy!

07:28.208 --> 07:31.625
Oh, what now?
Why isn't this working!

07:31.708 --> 07:34.000
Have you considered that your trouble
may be stress-related, sir?

07:34.083 --> 07:35.083
How do you mean?

07:35.167 --> 07:38.208
Well, destroying the Core of Light
is quite a tall order.

07:38.292 --> 07:42.417
The pressure to become the ultimate evil
in all of Skylands can weigh on a person.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.208
Hmm. You make a fair point, Glumwad.
But what can I do about it?

07:46.292 --> 07:48.250
I believe I have a fool-proof solution.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.125
-Are you sure it will work for me?
-I said fool-proof, sir.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.542
Noted. Lead on, my good troll.

07:57.708 --> 08:01.417
I know King Pen says
I can do anything a Skylander can, but...

08:01.500 --> 08:04.875
since I haven't exactly done
a single thing yet...

08:04.958 --> 08:06.083
Dude, that's why we're here!

08:06.167 --> 08:08.000
To help you
as much as you're gonna help us.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.292
Ergo, we'll start
with a little flight instruction,

08:10.375 --> 08:14.458
which happens to be my specialty.
For obvious reasons.

08:14.542 --> 08:18.375
Obviously.
You're talking about your wings, right?

08:18.458 --> 08:20.500
Exactly. And you've got them too, pal!

08:20.583 --> 08:24.208
So if you can fly even a little bit,
I'll whip you into shape!

08:24.292 --> 08:26.083
I'll do the same with my blades.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.500
I'll show you how to harness
the power of the air!

08:28.583 --> 08:31.083
I'll teach you how to burn, baby, burn!

08:31.167 --> 08:34.417
And I'll show you how to blow up
the entire academy!

08:34.500 --> 08:39.292
Or... one enemy. No reason to swing
for the fences on the first pitch.

08:39.375 --> 08:42.750
That all sounds great,
but I have so many other powers.

08:42.832 --> 08:47.750
Maybe we can use some of those, too?
Like my awesome mashed potato powers!

08:47.833 --> 08:48.833
Whoa!

08:51.833 --> 08:55.625
Easy, big guy. Look, everyone loves
a good spud-based super power,

08:55.708 --> 08:59.083
but let's keep it simple and show you how
to master your powers that are like ours.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.167
Oh...

09:00.250 --> 09:04.625
and I bet that will help you guys solve
whatever your problem is as a team too!

09:04.708 --> 09:07.250
Well, that's what King Pen
built you to do,

09:07.333 --> 09:09.208
so let's give it a whirl
and see what happens!

09:09.958 --> 09:12.333
-So, ready to go?
-Ready for what--

09:15.000 --> 09:18.583
Hey, hey! Relax, relax.
Trial by fire. I've got this.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.333
Spyro away!

09:48.292 --> 09:49.625
Whoo! Whoah!

10:02.875 --> 10:04.042
Mmm.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.542
Trust me, sir, a few treatments
here at Villains Oasis Day Spa

10:16.625 --> 10:20.417
and all the stress of being the
unquestioned evil overlord of the universe

10:20.500 --> 10:21.542
will just melt away.

10:21.625 --> 10:24.792
I'm still unclear
how any of this is supposed to help me

10:24.875 --> 10:26.708
project the map to the Core of Light.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.958
Relaxation is the key to
quality projection magic, sir. Believe me.

10:31.042 --> 10:35.083
But how am I supposed to relax here?
There aren't even any torture devices.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.333
Take your mind off torture for the day.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.458
You're here to pamper yourself.
You've earned it.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.833
Two gentlemen's respites, my good man.

10:42.917 --> 10:48.792
And please, any attendant except Olaf.
I want someone who respects boundaries.

10:51.667 --> 10:58.292
Ah, that's it, sir. Just let
all the evil tension melt away.

10:59.583 --> 11:03.417
I really appreciate you guys showing me
how to use my powers to be more like you!

11:03.500 --> 11:06.125
But do you think I helped you
with your team problem, though?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.500
A good question. But I think
we worked pretty well together

11:09.583 --> 11:11.833
making you more like one of us.

11:11.917 --> 11:12.917
Totally!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.167
Looking at Cy is like
looking in a mirror.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.208
-We could be twins!
-Seconded.

11:16.292 --> 11:18.042
And there's no better way
to show that we've overcome

11:18.125 --> 11:19.417
whatever our team issues were

11:19.500 --> 11:22.875
than facing that Fire Viper Simulation
and finally taking it down.

11:24.792 --> 11:29.833
So, Skylanders, are you ready to try
your new and hopefully improved hand

11:29.917 --> 11:31.208
on the simulation course?

11:31.292 --> 11:32.625
-As ready as we'll ever be!
-100%!

11:32.708 --> 11:34.250
-Bob's your uncle!
-Let's do this.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.000
It's seriously a flip of the coin!

11:36.083 --> 11:39.208
And I am looking forward to seeing
what you have added to this team.

11:39.292 --> 11:43.667
Just wait, King Pen! Get ready to watch
this banana split the bad guys!

11:43.750 --> 11:47.208
Well-punned and all, lad, but maybe
tone down the whole catchphrase thing?

11:47.292 --> 11:49.125
- Hmm? Okay?
- Mmm, 'kay.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.417
Skylanders, fight!

11:53.833 --> 11:55.250
Let's fly, Cy!

11:57.292 --> 12:00.125
No, dude, you're supposed
to go on the other side of...

12:04.333 --> 12:05.917
Are you okay?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.417
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm all right, dude.

12:07.500 --> 12:11.708
Cy! Come on, let's show this
overgrown garden snake some real moves!

12:16.833 --> 12:20.042
Dude, what are you doing?
Wait till the target is close enough to--

12:21.625 --> 12:24.250
Don't worry, buddy.
It's time to bring the heat.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.375
And the pop!

12:29.083 --> 12:32.833
No, you're supposed to fire
a potion explosion deal! A pop!

12:32.917 --> 12:34.208
Ah, right, right!

12:37.042 --> 12:39.750
No, Cy! I need one of your flame shots!

12:39.833 --> 12:42.667
-You do? But Eruptor said--
-Get down!

12:44.250 --> 12:50.083
Wow. Close one. Wait... I have
just the thing for that, right, JV?

12:50.167 --> 12:52.500
Do you?

13:05.375 --> 13:06.375
Did we win?

13:07.458 --> 13:12.208
All right! Go Skylanders! Whoo-hoo! Yes!

13:14.292 --> 13:16.208
I won't sugar coat it, Skylanders.

13:16.292 --> 13:19.958
The Fire Viper Simulation should be
a walk in the park for you by now.

13:20.042 --> 13:23.000
I am very concerned
about the future of this team.

13:23.083 --> 13:26.083
Cy's vast skill set should have
improved your performance.

13:26.167 --> 13:29.792
And working within the team dynamic
should have honed your performance.

13:29.875 --> 13:33.333
I, too, am greatly concerned.
And I fear I may have to take you apart,

13:33.417 --> 13:35.917
piece by piece,
to get to the root of this problem.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.417
Now, if only there were
a good thinking spot here at the academy,

13:39.500 --> 13:42.958
-where I could ponder deep thoughts.
-Oh! I have just the spot!

13:44.792 --> 13:47.208
I guess being able to do a lot
doesn't matter much

13:47.292 --> 13:49.333
if you don't know how to use any of it.

13:49.417 --> 13:53.792
-I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
-I'm not so sure you were the problem, Cy.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.375
Eruptor's right.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.792
King Pen designed you to help any team...

13:58.875 --> 14:00.875
and we're more dysfunctional
than ever now.

14:00.958 --> 14:02.667
Which can only mean one thing.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.667
We're not a team... at all.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.708
I thought I'd always be a Skylander.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.792
I've never considered doing
anything but that.

14:13.875 --> 14:17.667
We all thought that. I don't think
any one of us has a fall-back option.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.375
Do you really always come here to think?

14:19.458 --> 14:22.333
Because I literally have never
even seen you here before this week.

14:22.417 --> 14:25.833
Um... it's the thinking spot, Spyro.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.125
We all come here.

14:27.208 --> 14:30.542
Although now that we're
probably not going to be a team anymore,

14:30.625 --> 14:33.625
I might stop.
I'm thinking of opening a cafe.

14:33.708 --> 14:37.500
Artisan coffees, bespoke pastries.
That sort of thing.

14:37.583 --> 14:41.000
I wonder if there are
any volcanos hiring.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.875
Well, I have tenure at the academy so...
good luck!

14:44.958 --> 14:48.375
I wish I could stay here
and truly train,

14:48.458 --> 14:50.083
but you heard Sensei King Pen...

14:50.167 --> 14:53.417
back to the drawing board for me.
Literally.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.750
He's gonna take me apart
until he figures out why I'm such a loser.

14:56.833 --> 15:00.000
-Um, guys?
-Loser? Are you kidding me?

15:00.083 --> 15:03.542
With all the great stuff you can do?
You're amazing!

15:03.625 --> 15:05.042
Yeah. We're the losers.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.250
Our mistake
was trying to make you like us.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.458
Guys!

15:09.208 --> 15:11.625
A lesson learned
too late I suppose, but...

15:11.708 --> 15:14.417
clearly, we shouldn't have
stomped on your individuality.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.917
You just needed to be you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Guys!

15:17.083 --> 15:21.250
Pop! Seriously, dude, not every cloud
in the sky looks like a Fire Viper.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.667
Uh... that's no cloud.

15:25.708 --> 15:27.083
Uh-oh.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.500
Glumshanks. Glumshanks!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.792
- Glumshanks!
- What is it, master?

15:35.875 --> 15:38.667
The map. It's gone!
I can't make it appear at all!

15:38.750 --> 15:39.792
Calm down, sir.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.500
-I'm sure if you just relax--
-No!

15:43.625 --> 15:47.708
I am done relaxing.
Not that anyone could relax in this place.

15:48.958 --> 15:53.583
Candles? Incense?
New Age ambient music?

15:53.667 --> 15:56.667
It's no wonder I'm so tense.
And it's all your fault!

15:56.750 --> 16:01.333
I will admit the music is
a little much in these places.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.542
What I need now to relax
is to inflict on you

16:03.625 --> 16:05.917
the most horrific punishment imaginable.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.333
And I know just what it will be.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.958
Whoa! This is a lot realer
than the simulation!

16:19.042 --> 16:21.292
More real!

16:21.375 --> 16:23.333
- What?
- Realer isn't a word!

16:23.417 --> 16:25.250
Not the time, grammar police!

16:25.333 --> 16:28.333
Will you two stop bickering
and get ready to fight?

16:28.417 --> 16:31.542
What's the point?
We already know how this ends.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.750
Yeah, we've thrown everything we have
at this thing a million times

16:34.833 --> 16:37.125
in simulations and we never win.

16:42.250 --> 16:46.083
Guys? Maybe we should throw something
at this thing that we don't have.

16:46.167 --> 16:50.333
Wait, that's it! We've been so busy
re-using our powers over and over again

16:50.417 --> 16:52.583
that... we didn't realize
we had more in our arsenal!

16:52.667 --> 16:55.458
Someone with his own unique powers
to go with ours!

16:55.542 --> 16:57.250
What do you mean, Spyro?

16:57.333 --> 16:59.500
We need you to do what it is you do best.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.625
Whatever makes you different than us!

17:02.708 --> 17:06.791
Maybe that's the missing ingredient
we need to finally take this bad boy down!

17:10.833 --> 17:15.958
What makes me different?
Okay, but what is that?

17:16.041 --> 17:18.125
Whatever it is that isn't like us!

17:18.208 --> 17:21.875
You do what you do best.
We'll do what we do best.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.958
And maybe together we can win!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.000
Even if that means
the occasional catchphrase.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.125
Hawk and awe, baby!

17:29.208 --> 17:30.542
I'm calling that catchphrase. It's mine.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.958
Let's go bananas!

17:34.083 --> 17:36.083
Hmm, bit of a groaner, but I'll allow it.

17:38.667 --> 17:42.583
Spyro,
show this lizard how to make a real fire!

17:42.667 --> 17:43.667
I'm all fired up!

17:45.042 --> 17:46.542
Hey, did I just catchphrase?

17:46.625 --> 17:48.458
You did! Now flame on!

18:01.042 --> 18:03.958
Pop! Eruptor! Blow it up!

18:04.042 --> 18:06.500
Born to burn!

18:09.542 --> 18:11.750
Motion of the potion!

18:27.250 --> 18:28.333
I got you!

18:28.417 --> 18:30.292
One sec.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.500
Hawk and awe!

18:42.667 --> 18:44.792
Let's finish him off, Skylanders!

18:44.875 --> 18:46.958
Guys? May I do the honors?

18:48.708 --> 18:52.000
Mashed potato power!

18:58.667 --> 19:00.292
I'm the real peel!

19:00.375 --> 19:02.958
-Great job, Cy!
-Yay!

19:03.042 --> 19:04.708
- Spiffing job!
- We rule!

19:04.792 --> 19:08.417
-You did it!
-No, we did it. As a team.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.792
Indeed you did.

19:10.875 --> 19:15.125
And if you've defeated an actual
Fire Viper, then I can finally say

19:15.208 --> 19:17.750
you passed the simulation
with flying colors.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.125
Congratulations.

19:19.208 --> 19:22.667
Cy did exactly what you built him to do,
King Pen.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.667
Figure out what it was we were missing
all along.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.042
And what was that?

19:27.125 --> 19:31.042
Remembering that teamwork is more
important than our own individual powers.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.583
Yep. All of our abilities are awesome,

19:33.667 --> 19:36.333
but if we don't use them together,
then we'll never win.

19:36.417 --> 19:41.167
Cy, you have proven that you are
exactly the warrior we designed you to be.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.542
I never doubted you.

19:42.625 --> 19:46.042
Well, maybe for a moment I did.
Perhaps longer.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.000
Enough to consider
scrapping all your parts

19:48.083 --> 19:49.667
and starting from scratch if need be.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.750
But all's well that ends well, right?

19:51.833 --> 19:55.000
Well, it felt great to finally help
the team figure out its missing link.

19:55.083 --> 19:58.875
And you shall do so again, Cy.
There will surely be other Skylanders

19:58.958 --> 20:01.458
across the realm
that will need your help in due time.

20:01.542 --> 20:04.292
Hey, you never did figure out
your catchphrase, did you?

20:04.375 --> 20:07.042
Oh, I've had my own catchphrase for years.
I just don't use it.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.333
I'm cool like that.

20:08.417 --> 20:12.333
Ah, totally get it!
The silent-but-deadly type!

20:13.042 --> 20:15.958
Ooh! That was totally your catchphrase,
wasn't it?

20:16.042 --> 20:17.458
I'm workshopping it.

20:20.083 --> 20:24.000
Please, sir, no. I...
I understand you need to torture me but...

20:24.083 --> 20:28.125
waiting in line at the Skylands DMV
is cruel and unusual,

20:28.208 --> 20:30.208
even by your standards.

20:30.292 --> 20:33.292
It's the least you deserve
for all that spa nonsense.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.167
I've still got cucumber seeds in my eye!

20:36.250 --> 20:38.625
And besides, you need
to renew your toadie license anyway.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.750
- Next.
- A-ha!

20:45.333 --> 20:46.917
This is the wrong line for these.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.667
If you want to renew your toadie license,
you need to wait over there.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.750
No!
Please, no!

20:54.833 --> 21:00.167
Oh, Glumshanks,
this is exactly what I needed. Look!

21:00.250 --> 21:04.333
Ah, congratulations, sir.
Shall I fetch a quill and some parchment?

21:04.417 --> 21:06.083
Nah. I'd rather watch you suffer.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.958
Besides, now that I'm back on my game,
I can copy the map down any time.

21:10.042 --> 21:15.500
I mean, it's not like the Core of Light
is going anywhere.

21:17.583 --> 21:21.583
Hmm...

21:24.250 --> 21:28.667
And now to move
the Core of Light.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.750
Come on. Work with me.
