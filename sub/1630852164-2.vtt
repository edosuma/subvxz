You know, as we all know, guys,

our Lethal Weapon movies
were always intended

02:00.254 --> 02:02.689
to be a trilogy that followed
a trilogy, plus a sequel,

07:14.635 --> 07:16.270
‐Oh, Mac. Yeah, you were, uh...
‐Yeah, Mac had a note.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.339
‐You were gonna give some notes.
‐Yes. Uh, yes. Uh...

07:19.373 --> 07:20.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.075
What's this?
Now, I hope you're not, uh,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.310
hating on Pepper Jack's flow?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.512
No. No, no,
I'm not hating on your...

07:25.546 --> 07:27.481
I mean, I feel, like,
I'm‐I'm in the way here.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.149
‐Are my headphones working?
‐Well, you guys,
you're not in the way.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.517
‐Are yours, are yours working?
‐You guys are... Yeah.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.452
Um, no. I‐I think what‐‐

07:32.486 --> 07:34.388
Your flow is great. I think
what you're doing's great.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.323
The thing is,
maybe this next take,

07:36.356 --> 07:38.692
you could do it
a little bit more...

07:38.725 --> 07:40.060
A little more...

07:41.562 --> 07:42.529
‐...Pepper Jack.
‐Yeah.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.630
A little bit more Pepper Jack.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.998
‐That's what I was thinking.
‐Okay.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.466
‐Yeah. Okay.
‐Well, okay then.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.336
‐Now we cooking. All right.
‐Okay. We're cooking.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.371
‐Thank you, Pepper Jack.
Thank you.
‐Hey, no problem, man.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.006
‐Little more Pepper Jack.
‐DENNIS: Hey, man,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.541
you didn't give him the note.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.310
Yeah. Well...

07:56.343 --> 07:58.445
Guys, look, I‐I just don't think

07:58.478 --> 08:00.447
we should be silencing
Black voices.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.516
Guys, there's a larger issue
at play here,

08:02.549 --> 08:04.284
and that is that all the
people of color that we know

08:04.318 --> 08:06.220
are people of the bridges
and the streets, okay?

08:06.253 --> 08:08.121
Look, they're pimps and
prostitutes, which, I tell you,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.756
says a lot more about us

08:09.790 --> 08:11.124
than it does about them,
that's for sure.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.526
‐That's not a great look.
‐That's not...

08:12.559 --> 08:14.628
We're gonna have to do
some real soul‐searching.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.263
‐We should really open up our...
‐DENNIS: Yeah, absolutely.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.131
We got to dig real deep
into our contacts,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.701
and we got to find, like,
diverse voices that don't...

08:20.734 --> 08:22.703
‐Yeah.
‐Uh, oh, guys, actually,

08:22.736 --> 08:25.138
I think I know how to kill
two birds with one stone.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.214
Thank you for the opportunity,
and I'm hip to your hustle.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.383
Bringing a woman of color
to spice things up.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.185
Eh?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.587
Wait, where‐where is she?
Where is she?

08:40.621 --> 08:43.323
The woman of color?
Is right here.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.625
You're a woman of color?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.226
Yeah, I'm Persian.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.363
That's the ethnicity
from Iran. Hello?

08:49.396 --> 08:52.299
‐(chuckles) He's, uh, ignorant.
‐Anyway,

08:52.332 --> 08:56.103
there's a dearth of Iranian
female directors, so thank you.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.638
Uh...

08:57.671 --> 08:59.640
Yeah, uh, to be clear, you
will be the assistant director.

08:59.673 --> 09:03.043
Okay, we'll see.
Now, let's talk about payment.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.445
I will accept
the following things:

09:05.479 --> 09:07.447
coins, cash,

09:07.481 --> 09:09.216
checks,

09:09.249 --> 09:12.252
food, vape pens,
pens in general, scissors.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.488
Sure. Let's‐let's move on
from this.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.256
Uh, guys, uh...

09:16.290 --> 09:18.025
I made a few changes
to the script

09:18.058 --> 09:19.593
because Dee was, well,
she was terrible.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.594
Oh, I could see that.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I sent her out to lunch,

09:22.362 --> 09:23.697
and I'd like to shoot
before she gets back.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.299
‐So can we do that?
‐Let's do this.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.300
Let's shoot. Okay, guys,
let's get to places.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.435
Okay, guys, let's get to places.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.304
‐Uh, well, I‐‐
That's what the director...
‐Well, let's get to places.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.239
Let's get to places.
Director in the house.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.774
‐Okay, fine.
I'll give the note.
‐Can you just let her speak?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.342
‐Well, you‐‐ Okay. Uh, yes.
‐Can you let her speak?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.211
(jazzy music plays)

09:37.244 --> 09:38.145
CHARLIE:
Wow.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.448
Good day, former partner.
Sorry I'm late.

09:41.481 --> 09:45.752
I‐I got a little up‐jammed
traffic on the 504, uh, 450,

09:45.786 --> 09:47.721
on the highway.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.723
Uh, I got off on "Spelly‐ba‐da,"

09:49.756 --> 09:52.226
but I took that all the way down
to Moorpark.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.028
And then I took that down
to "Ta‐ca‐ha" Cucamonga.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.432
And then I tackied all the way
over to Laurel Canyon. Ticky.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.033
Uh, this is gonna be tough
to cut around.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.436
(sighs) Artemis, did‐did
you give Pepper Jack the note?

10:02.469 --> 10:04.338
Yes. Yeah, I simply asked him

10:04.371 --> 10:06.373
if he's ever been
to a child's birthday party.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.442
He said yes.
I said, "Take us to that place.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.178
Make it authentic
to your experience."

10:11.211 --> 10:13.313
What? What do you mean
this is not my kid?

10:13.347 --> 10:15.182
Are you motherfuckers
kidding me?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.184
I've been paying child support
for five years,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.586
and Pepper Jack's
pullout game is strong.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.656
So, if I don't get
some answers real fast,

10:22.689 --> 10:24.691
Pepper Jack about to cut
all of y'all.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.360
Oh. Oh, shit.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.427
MAC:
Go with it, Charlie.
We can use it.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.163
What's next? Come on. The phone.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.697
The phone. The phone.
We're going to the phone bit.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.332
‐MAC: Fix it, Charlie. Fix it.
‐All right, yeah.

10:32.366 --> 10:35.569
Oh, man, I would cut,
I would cut someone, too. Damn.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.172
‐Yeah, I'm sure you do have a
good pullout game, Pepper Jack.
‐(phone ringing)

10:38.205 --> 10:40.440
Uh‐oh. What's that?
This is phone,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.209
‐that I've whole had
on me this time.
‐(phone beeps)

10:42.242 --> 10:45.479
Uh, hello, who's this?
It's Charlie‐‐ uh, Riggs.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.315
Sorry to interrupt, boys.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.218
‐I hope you're having as much...
‐Honey, what is the matter?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.053
Uh, I'm fine.
Keep going, keep going.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.454
I don't think your dick work.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.256
He might need an anal stimulant.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.325
Candy, get the butter!

10:58.358 --> 11:01.628
No! No butter.
There's no butter involved.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.330
What about
the Brando thing, Frank?

11:03.363 --> 11:05.432
‐It don't work the other way.
‐Yeah, it does.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.567
PEPPER JACK:
Uh, Frank?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.035
You gonna have to
pay Pepper Jack,

11:08.068 --> 11:09.336
whether you bust a nut or not.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.038
You understand that, don't you?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.372
I don't know what's happening.
Are we still in the scene?

11:12.406 --> 11:15.175
That's my Fraggle Rock thermos.
He stole that from me.

11:15.209 --> 11:17.711
Wh... What's this?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.047
‐Are you guys
shooting without me?
‐Dee's here.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.215
‐C‐Cut.
‐Goddamn it, Dee!

11:21.248 --> 11:22.716
‐Cut.
‐Yeah, cut.
‐Cut.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.451
‐(overlapping chatter)
‐Goddamn it, Dennis.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.086
‐Let's take a five, everybody.
‐Let's take a five.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.588
Listen. Guys, none of this
is working.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.655
You think we got to fire
Pepper Jack?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.390
No, no, no, no, no.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.025
His anger and intensity
are‐are good, you know?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.161
Just... not for
this role. (sighs)

11:34.194 --> 11:36.296
I think we need
to recast Murtaugh.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.699
We need someone lovable,
someone versatile,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.434
someone with the skill, range,

11:40.467 --> 11:43.437
and talent of one of the best
actors of our generation.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.571
We need Don Cheadle.

11:44.605 --> 11:46.240
You know Don Cheadle?

11:46.273 --> 11:49.576
No. But I know the guy
that plays him.

11:49.610 --> 11:51.612
(jazzy music playing)

11:54.681 --> 11:57.618
Hey, partner. Happy you made it.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.053
Oh, sorry I'm late.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.622
People be driving
like bitches on the 405.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.757
‐(chuckles)
‐And my level of intensity

12:03.790 --> 12:05.726
is because I am crazy
on account of my wife's murder.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.296
In case anybody is feeling
uncomfortable about it.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.465
I think this is working.
This is, like, way better.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.235
That's okay.
I'm just glad you're here.

12:15.269 --> 12:17.571
(chuckles)
Man... Whew.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.239
We getting too old
for this shit, huh?

12:19.273 --> 12:20.707
PEPPER JACK:
Well, yeah, we are.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.443
Hey. Happy birthday, baby girl.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.611
Now, I...

12:24.645 --> 12:26.246
I...

12:26.280 --> 12:29.716
I‐I know I haven't always
been there for you,

12:29.750 --> 12:31.718
but I want you

12:31.752 --> 12:34.755
to know I'm always,

12:34.788 --> 12:37.457
always with you.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.458
Right here.

12:38.492 --> 12:41.028
In your heart.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.163
(crying)

12:43.197 --> 12:44.731
‐Whoa, he's really good.
‐He's good.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.633
‐He's really good.
‐He's the‐‐ he's a real actor.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.502
‐He's the real deal.
‐Okay. Here comes
our new villain, guys.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.103
Fingers crossed it works.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.572
(phone ringing)

12:51.605 --> 12:55.175
Hold that thought, son.
My shit be blowing up.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.510
Talk to me.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.345
Excuse me?

12:58.378 --> 13:01.448
What are you doing in this park
in my neighborhood?

13:01.481 --> 13:02.649
Who is this, bitch?

13:02.683 --> 13:05.719
It's Karen. Karen White.

13:05.752 --> 13:09.189
And I live in this neighborhood,
and I am sure that you do not.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.325
And if you don't leave right
now, I will call the police,

13:11.358 --> 13:13.327
and I will tell them
you attacked me.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.362
I just don't understand
how this is a villain.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.166
Well, one of the last socially
acceptable groups to villainize

13:19.199 --> 13:21.068
‐are entitled white women.
‐Mm.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.202
It's just, like,
making me uncomfortable.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.470
You know what I mean?

13:23.504 --> 13:25.205
‐It's not fun, is it?
‐It's no fun.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.174
‐No. She's a cunt. She's a cunt.
‐You want our movie to be fun.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.709
She's a little bit cunty.
It's just too real.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.444
Damn it, guys.
I really wanted this to work.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.246
I really did,

13:32.279 --> 13:34.181
but maybe putting up
any group of people as villains

13:34.214 --> 13:36.350
‐these days is potentially
problematic. I don't know.
‐Yeah.

13:36.383 --> 13:40.754
Maybe‐maybe villains
shouldn't be people at all, huh?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.456
Wait, you're
totally right. Right?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.757
Like wh‐‐ Like what
if we make the villain,

13:43.790 --> 13:45.192
like, a big dog
or something, right?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.193
Or a bunch of raccoons

13:46.226 --> 13:48.095
stacked up in a trench coat?
You know? (gasps)

13:48.128 --> 13:50.564
Or a trench coat
full of bees flying around?

13:50.597 --> 13:52.366
‐Like, that would scare me.
Imagine seeing that.
‐Bees! Bees are cool.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.567
‐Bees are scary.
‐What about,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.469
like, a plague?
An act of God.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.172
All the best villains
in the Bible were acts of God.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.341
‐A tsunami.
‐(overlapping agreements)

14:01.375 --> 14:03.710
Ooh, but, you know what?
Let's call it a tidal wave.

14:03.744 --> 14:05.479
That feels
less racially charged.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.314
‐Yeah. Right, right.
‐I don't want to say that‐‐

14:07.347 --> 14:09.483
I don't want to say
that all waves are Asian.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.318
Yeah, you want to make sure
that waves are, you know...

14:11.351 --> 14:12.386
‐Just neutral.
‐Yeah. Not‐not culturally...

14:12.419 --> 14:13.787
(overlapping chatter,
agreement)

14:13.820 --> 14:15.055
‐That's good, that's good.
‐Um...

14:15.088 --> 14:17.057
(jazzy music playing)

14:20.394 --> 14:22.563
Hey, happy birthday, baby girl.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.399
I know I haven't always
been there for you.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.569
But...

14:28.602 --> 14:31.471
I'm always with you.

14:31.505 --> 14:33.507
Right here,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.576
in your heart.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.312
‐(crying)
‐(phone ringing)

14:38.345 --> 14:40.247
Uh, h‐hold all that crying, man.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.582
Let me‐‐ I‐I‐‐
My shit be blowing up.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.050
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.788
Oh. It says, "Look behind you."

14:47.821 --> 14:50.657
‐(dramatic music playing)
‐Oh, no!

14:50.691 --> 14:53.694
Tidal wave!
Where'd that come from?

14:53.727 --> 14:55.762
Well, no country specifically.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.065
Just an act of God, I guess.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.167
No God specifically,
just the universe

15:00.200 --> 15:02.035
or whatever.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.398
‐This is a piece of shit.
‐(Mac sighs)
‐Yeah.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.013
‐I can't work like this.
‐No. (stammers)

15:13.046 --> 15:14.448
We can't even
get past the first scene.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.350
Well, I don't know what
the point of making a movie is

15:16.383 --> 15:17.751
‐if we can't even be in it.
‐Yeah, or bang whores.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.219
All right, guys, listen.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.054
We can still do this.
Okay, what about this?

15:21.088 --> 15:22.689
What if Riggs and Murtaugh

15:22.723 --> 15:25.425
start to shoot out a path
so that the tidal wave moves

15:25.459 --> 15:29.029
to a field that's been
decimated by climate change.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.430
‐That doesn't even
make any sense.
‐Climate change? That's so dumb.

15:30.464 --> 15:33.167
That sucks, man. I don't want
to watch that movie.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.168
Guys, I know it's not great,
all right?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.269
But it's the right thing to do,

15:35.302 --> 15:37.171
and we have to do
the right thing.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.740
Since when do you care
about doing the right thing?

15:39.773 --> 15:41.074
Guys, guys, listen, listen.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.342
Over the course
of the last year,

15:42.376 --> 15:44.578
I've learned to listen,
to not talk, to grow.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.480
Guys, I'm woke.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.550
Okay? Now, let me tell you
how I reached this awakening.

15:51.585 --> 15:53.620
I was on a date, and, as usual,
I fibbed about my age a bit

15:53.654 --> 15:55.689
so I could score
a younger prospect.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.058
The woman was in her 20s,
and the date

15:58.091 --> 16:00.394
was going quite well,
or so I thought.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.463
It becomes just, like, so clear

16:03.497 --> 16:05.165
that the patriarchy

16:05.199 --> 16:08.035
is‐is really just
an off‐shoot of privilege.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.703
(stammers) Uh, 100%. Yeah.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.572
No, I‐‐ Yeah. Um...

16:11.605 --> 16:14.141
You know, you have
the most beautiful eyes.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.210
Thanks. D‐‐ (chuckles)

16:16.243 --> 16:18.045
Don't you agree with what
I was just saying, though?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.547
Abso‐‐ Yeah. Tot‐‐ I mean, yeah.
(stammers) Whatever.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.482
‐Whatever?
‐Listen, can...

16:22.516 --> 16:24.084
can we just keep this light,
you know?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.719
I'm‐I'm less interested
in politics

16:25.752 --> 16:28.055
and more interested
in what makes you tick.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.690
Oh, my God.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.025
Oh, you're gross. God.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.660
DENNIS:
The young generation

16:33.694 --> 16:35.329
on the left seemed to be
a tough nut to crack,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.297
so I turned my attention

16:37.331 --> 16:39.399
to the youth of the right.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.034
Socialists are ripping away
our freedom.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.337
‐Totally.
‐It's a slippery slope

16:43.370 --> 16:45.305
until we are living
in a failed welfare state.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.174
Right. Hey, what do you say
we get out of here

16:47.207 --> 16:48.575
and get into our own
slippery state?

16:48.609 --> 16:49.476
You know what I mean, Lisa?

16:49.510 --> 16:51.445
No.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.313
I'm talking about us banging,
you conservative little minx.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.048
Pig.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.185
DENNIS:
I was learning.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
This generation
is more socially active

17:00.220 --> 17:02.155
on both sides
of the aisle, so...

17:02.189 --> 17:04.291
this time, I engaged.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.026
‐I mean, don't you agree?
‐Yes.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.195
We need to allow others
a chance to speak for once.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.731
Well, yes, but even
by saying, "Allow,"

17:10.764 --> 17:13.333
you're implying that
you have all the power.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.702
Uh, but I thought you were
saying I did have the power?

17:15.736 --> 17:16.737
Are you twisting my words?

17:16.770 --> 17:18.305
No. I'm just, uh...

17:18.338 --> 17:19.706
(chuckles)
I'm just trying to understand

17:19.740 --> 17:21.441
what the hell you're
talking about. I‐I can't follow.

17:21.475 --> 17:24.711
(scoffs) See? This is exactly
what old people always do.

17:24.745 --> 17:26.280
‐Old people?
‐Uh‐huh.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.714
I'm 26.

17:27.748 --> 17:29.583
DENNIS:
But my rational thinking

17:29.616 --> 17:31.718
and my desire for an open
dialogue were a dead giveaway.

17:31.752 --> 17:33.453
It was all starting

17:33.487 --> 17:34.721
to make sense.

17:34.755 --> 17:36.356
See, this generation
doesn't even understand

17:36.390 --> 17:38.058
half the shit
that they're saying.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.560
They aren't
more ethical than us.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.396
They just want
to be perceived as such.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.397
And who could blame them?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.698
I mean, they've spent
their entire adult lives

17:44.731 --> 17:46.700
only 280 characters away

17:46.733 --> 17:48.569
from being tweeted
into oblivion.

17:48.602 --> 17:50.604
Either way,

17:50.637 --> 17:52.272
I took a new tack...

17:52.306 --> 17:53.707
We need to use our privilege

17:53.740 --> 17:56.043
as much as we
possibly can to protect people.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.611
How can you not see that?

17:57.644 --> 18:00.214
We need to use our privilege

18:00.247 --> 18:03.417
to protect people
as much as we can.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.719
How can I not see that?

18:05.752 --> 18:09.223
‐Because if we don't, who will?
‐Because if we don't, who will?

18:09.256 --> 18:11.325
Exactly. What we need
is a revolution.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.461
Exactly.
What we need is a revolution.

18:14.495 --> 18:15.629
DENNIS:
Simply regurgitating
back to them

18:15.662 --> 18:16.663
exactly what they're saying
to each other

18:16.697 --> 18:18.265
in their ridiculous
echo chambers

18:18.298 --> 18:19.299
is all they want.

18:19.333 --> 18:22.135
And then, we can get
what we want.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.705
ANNA:
Yes, Daddy! (moaning)

18:24.738 --> 18:26.440
‐Daddy!
‐(groaning)

18:26.473 --> 18:29.309
(Anna panting)

18:29.343 --> 18:30.511
DENNIS:
Oh, also they're riddled
with insecurity

18:30.544 --> 18:33.447
and have serious daddy issues,
so that helps.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.016
Guys, we have to listen
to the young.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.051
Otherwise,
we are doomed to have sex

18:38.085 --> 18:40.320
with only old people
for the rest of our lives,

18:40.354 --> 18:41.622
and I won't do that.

18:41.655 --> 18:42.756
‐No.
‐Right.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.757
Oh, my God.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.659
I never thought about that, man.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.161
So, you know what I say?

18:47.194 --> 18:50.731
Finger on the pulse,
finger on the puss.

18:50.764 --> 18:52.599
Ew.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.468
‐Ew.
‐That's gross.

18:54.501 --> 18:57.304
‐I see what you're saying now.
‐So‐so what do we do?

18:57.337 --> 18:59.406
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.340
(quietly):
All right.

19:00.374 --> 19:02.309
Uh, hi.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.744
‐Hey, hey.
‐DENNIS: Uh, Mr....

19:03.777 --> 19:05.746
Cheadle‐‐ Uh, Donovan McNabb...

19:05.779 --> 19:07.447
T‐Tiger Woods, Elvin‐‐

19:07.481 --> 19:09.483
whatev‐whatever your name is.
Um, listen,

19:09.516 --> 19:12.286
we have, uh, we have come
to the conclusion that, um,

19:12.319 --> 19:15.489
you and only you
have the knowledge,

19:15.522 --> 19:19.259
the experience and the‐the
authenticity to tell this story.

19:19.293 --> 19:21.428
So, we are gonna do the right
thing. We're gonna, we're gonna

19:21.461 --> 19:23.030
do the woke thing,

19:23.063 --> 19:25.566
and hand complete
creative control

19:25.599 --> 19:27.434
over to you...

19:33.340 --> 19:34.708
I feel like you were
gonna say something else?

19:34.741 --> 19:37.311
‐Well...
‐I think he was waiting
for the applause.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.612
Well... (chuckles)

19:38.645 --> 19:41.448
Oh. Okay? Uh...

19:41.481 --> 19:43.317
‐Oh, yeah! Yay!
‐Sure, sure.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.718
If you must.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.420
It's nice when it happens,
isn't it?

19:46.453 --> 19:47.287
‐Feels nice.
‐Sure. Nice when
it happens naturally.

19:47.321 --> 19:48.589
When it happens naturally,
I like it.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.057
Yeah, um, listen, the point is,

19:50.090 --> 19:52.426
we want you to know
that we are allies.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.127
Great.

19:54.161 --> 19:55.329
‐Okay?
‐We are allies.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.030
‐MAC: We are your allies.
‐Up top.
‐Allies!

19:57.064 --> 19:58.532
‐Yes, yes, yes.
‐(whooping)

19:58.565 --> 20:00.200
‐We're on your side.
‐(dramatic music plays)

20:00.234 --> 20:02.436
GEOFFREY:
But were they?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.671
Lethal Weapon 7 was destined
to be an inferno

20:04.705 --> 20:07.274
of quasi‐wokeness and, uh,

20:07.307 --> 20:08.742
good old‐fashioned racism.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.410
(chuckles) Out of the, uh,

20:10.444 --> 20:13.547
smoldering ashes, however,
I pieced together

20:13.580 --> 20:15.282
a cautionary tale.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.719
An exploration, not of what
is gained by learning,

20:18.752 --> 20:20.721
but of what is lost

20:20.754 --> 20:23.557
by staying ignorant.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.425
(explosion)

20:25.459 --> 20:27.261
(audience applauding, cheering)

20:33.200 --> 20:35.435
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Wow.

20:35.469 --> 20:37.704
Oh, my God.
This is so humiliating.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.407
Where does he get off
telling our story

20:40.440 --> 20:42.309
without even
including us at all?

20:42.342 --> 20:43.577
And he made us look
like assholes.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.678
I feel used.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.180
I feel misunderstood.

20:46.213 --> 20:47.714
What does he know
about our experience?

20:47.748 --> 20:49.716
Yeah. I'll tell you, there's
only one thing left to do.

20:49.750 --> 20:50.717
Make Lethal Weapon 8?

20:50.751 --> 20:51.718
‐Yup.
‐Yeah, right?

20:51.752 --> 20:53.287
(overlapping chatter, agreement)

20:53.320 --> 20:54.588
Yes. Yes!

20:54.621 --> 20:56.023
‐I'll play Murtaugh.
‐Goddamn it, Mac.

20:56.056 --> 20:57.424
‐I‐I'll play Murtaugh.
‐No! No, no, no, no.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.458
‐Did you not watch the...
‐I'll do it good.
