00:03.065 --> 00:04.649
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.650 --> 00:06.984
Take some sexy pictures
to expose the affair,

00:06.985 --> 00:08.151
marriage over.

00:08.153 --> 00:09.862
Or we put a gun to his head

00:09.863 --> 00:11.030
and make him get on the boat.

00:11.031 --> 00:13.115
But why is there a gun
on the wall?

00:13.116 --> 00:14.492
We've always had a gun.

00:14.493 --> 00:15.868
This is a Futterman house.

00:15.869 --> 00:17.995
These people,
they're not our people.

00:17.996 --> 00:18.996
It's a mistake

00:18.997 --> 00:20.957
to think we have any
connection to this time.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.875
I love the '80s!

00:22.876 --> 00:24.168
‐Gabe! ‐They took my Cupcake.

00:24.169 --> 00:26.587
My god, Cupcake, I'm
never letting go again.

00:26.588 --> 00:28.799
I thought you were going to
try to tell me you were gay.

00:30.008 --> 00:31.008
Right.

00:31.009 --> 00:32.051
My boat still
leaves at midnight.

00:32.052 --> 00:33.219
Fuck free will!

00:33.220 --> 00:34.345
I should have done
the gun thing!

00:34.346 --> 00:35.930
Neither one of us
is going to be free

00:35.931 --> 00:37.348
until we finish what we started.

00:37.349 --> 00:39.601
You're wrong, because I quit.

00:43.438 --> 00:45.690
You can't quit.

00:45.691 --> 00:48.401
I can, and I do.

00:48.402 --> 00:51.904
You keep fighting to
make a better future.

00:51.905 --> 00:54.073
But I've found the best future,

00:54.074 --> 00:55.866
and it's in the past.

00:55.867 --> 00:59.704
Right now, 1985.

00:59.705 --> 01:01.039
The present.

01:02.749 --> 01:04.709
Catch you on the
flipside, Tiger.

01:10.132 --> 01:12.049
Wolf, wait.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.884
Wolf!

01:13.885 --> 01:15.971
Wolf, Wolf!

01:19.224 --> 01:20.850
The fuck!

01:20.851 --> 01:25.814
Are you all wearing
your sunglasses at night?

01:28.317 --> 01:29.443
Fuck off!

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:50.756 --> 01:53.633
Quiet as a ninja.

01:58.764 --> 02:02.059
Come on, Uncle Barry.

02:07.981 --> 02:09.232
Are you kidding me?

02:21.328 --> 02:22.746
I fit in.

02:24.306 --> 02:25.534
Fuck free will.

02:54.736 --> 02:55.654
All right!

02:55.655 --> 02:57.947
Hey, that was‐‐
that was radical,

02:57.948 --> 02:59.657
‐dude. ‐Thanks, man.

02:59.658 --> 03:02.326
Can't spell "funnel"
without "fun," am I right?

03:02.327 --> 03:04.203
Yep, you are Gabe all right.

03:04.204 --> 03:07.039
That's mi nombre, do I know you?

03:07.040 --> 03:10.084
No, no, we haven't met.

03:10.085 --> 03:11.961
There's something
familiar about you.

03:11.962 --> 03:13.170
What‐‐what's your name?

03:13.171 --> 03:15.297
I'm J‐‐Joosh.

03:15.298 --> 03:19.301
‐Joosh, your name's Joosh.
‐Yes, my name is Joosh.

03:19.302 --> 03:21.679
Wow, that rules!

03:21.680 --> 03:23.639
‐We're gonna go get high. ‐What?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.516
You‐‐you don't get high.

03:25.517 --> 03:27.143
You're right, I stay high.

03:27.144 --> 03:28.436
‐You in? ‐Wow, you know,

03:28.437 --> 03:31.355
there's nothing that
I would rather do than...

03:31.356 --> 03:34.024
than to stay and party
with you, but I‐‐I..

03:34.025 --> 03:36.527
I've got somewhere
I've got to be.

03:36.528 --> 03:38.112
Hey, man, door's always open.

03:38.113 --> 03:39.655
This is a‐‐this is
a Futterman house,

03:39.656 --> 03:42.533
so that means it's
a party house, okay?

03:42.534 --> 03:44.578
So come by anytime.

03:50.750 --> 03:51.750
Hey, you know what?

03:51.751 --> 03:52.877
I do have some time.

03:52.878 --> 03:56.213
I would love to stay
and party with you,

03:56.214 --> 03:57.423
‐young Gabe. ‐Get over here...

03:57.424 --> 03:58.841
‐Okay. ‐...new friend.

03:58.842 --> 03:59.884
All right!

03:59.885 --> 04:02.011
Love the coat, that's
French or something.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.139
Yeah, I just picked it up today.

04:13.899 --> 04:14.899
Don't even try.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.733
They'll never let you through.

04:16.735 --> 04:17.902
Yeah, that grody security guard

04:17.903 --> 04:19.069
is not letting anyone back there

04:19.070 --> 04:21.738
that's not the crew
or Corey's friends.

04:21.740 --> 04:24.158
I see 39 ways to
take this guy down.

04:24.159 --> 04:25.993
Forty, if he's not
wearing groin armor.

04:25.994 --> 04:27.787
Even if you make
it past that guy,

04:27.788 --> 04:30.247
there's tons more
guards backstage.

04:30.248 --> 04:32.041
Gonna need more numbers.

04:32.042 --> 04:33.375
Okay, we need a plan.

04:33.376 --> 04:34.543
It's pointless.

04:34.544 --> 04:36.670
The plan is to miss the concert

04:36.671 --> 04:38.422
and wait for our
moms to pick us up.

04:38.423 --> 04:39.924
Yeah, yeah, we're
just going to go home

04:39.925 --> 04:41.467
and never see Corey Hart ever.

04:41.468 --> 04:42.843
This is like the worst thing

04:42.844 --> 04:45.763
that's ever happened
to anyone ever

04:45.764 --> 04:49.350
in the history of humanity!

04:49.351 --> 04:50.227
Okay.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.769
Younglings,

04:51.770 --> 04:54.021
how many years
have you survived?

04:54.022 --> 04:55.648
15?

04:55.649 --> 04:58.776
Do you know what I
did in my 15th year?

04:58.777 --> 05:00.986
I won my first command

05:00.987 --> 05:03.697
by decapitating
my nemesis, Ostrich,

05:03.698 --> 05:06.784
in the proving pit to
earn my puberty scar.

05:06.785 --> 05:08.244
Now,

05:08.245 --> 05:09.620
we can do this.

05:09.621 --> 05:11.038
You're the biggest team
I've had since the tunnel,

05:11.039 --> 05:12.790
and that was 9,000 fingers ago,

05:12.791 --> 05:15.459
so how about a little less
saying what we can't do

05:15.460 --> 05:18.880
and a little more figuring
out what we're going to do?

05:23.844 --> 05:27.012
Joosh, I am your father.

05:27.013 --> 05:32.351
Ha‐ha, you are...
you really are.

05:32.352 --> 05:33.812
You're on.

05:35.313 --> 05:37.481
You know what?

05:37.482 --> 05:39.316
You taught me to ride a bike.

05:39.317 --> 05:40.985
I trust you, I guess.

05:40.986 --> 05:42.737
Joosh!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.951
That was a big one.

05:48.952 --> 05:50.452
The Joosh is loose!

05:50.453 --> 05:52.288
Joosh is loose.

05:52.289 --> 05:56.166
‐My brain melted.
‐Yeah‐‐shit's gnarly, right?

05:56.167 --> 05:59.044
I made Barry gank it
from dentist school.

05:59.045 --> 06:00.212
Dude, look at this.

06:00.213 --> 06:01.505
This is what's
inside these things.

06:01.506 --> 06:02.756
Barry?

06:02.757 --> 06:04.091
He's in dentist school?

06:04.092 --> 06:04.759
Was.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.302
Was, big was.

06:06.303 --> 06:08.345
Actually just got kicked out
for ganking the nitrous.

06:08.346 --> 06:10.222
You'd have to be
crazy to let that dude

06:10.223 --> 06:12.349
anywhere near your
teeth with a drill.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.476
I wouldn't let him near
drywall with a drill.

06:14.477 --> 06:16.729
You know, Gabe, sometimes people

06:16.730 --> 06:18.272
can get better at
things, you know?

06:18.273 --> 06:19.982
Give him a little more time
and maybe he'll make a change.

06:19.983 --> 06:23.193
People can change,
you know, big, big changes.

06:23.194 --> 06:23.904
Why?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.070
I hope not.

06:25.071 --> 06:27.573
My life is perfect right now.

06:27.574 --> 06:29.241
Why would I change a thing?

06:29.242 --> 06:32.036
Okay, well let's
just say, for example,

06:32.037 --> 06:34.413
‐you had a child. ‐Ha!

06:34.414 --> 06:35.456
‐A kid? ‐Yeah.

06:35.457 --> 06:38.542
I'm this close
to getting snipped,

06:38.543 --> 06:39.710
totally snipped.

06:39.711 --> 06:42.046
Barry's got a
friend in med school

06:42.047 --> 06:44.173
who says he'll do
it on me for free,

06:44.174 --> 06:45.549
if he can practice on me.

06:45.550 --> 06:48.385
I've just got to find a way
to get myself to Grenada.

06:48.386 --> 06:51.847
‐Plane or boat.
‐Yeah, you know, I, um...

06:51.848 --> 06:53.891
the snipping, I think
that that is a decision

06:53.892 --> 06:56.310
that I should try
not to influence.

06:56.311 --> 06:57.311
You know what, you'll make

06:57.312 --> 06:58.479
the right decision, I'm sure,

06:58.480 --> 07:01.650
‐when the time comes.
‐Hello, cupcakes!

07:04.486 --> 07:06.071
"Cupcake."

07:08.198 --> 07:11.075
‐Hey, Unc‐‐Barry. ‐.

07:11.076 --> 07:13.577
Who are those two girls
that just walked in?

07:13.578 --> 07:15.788
Um, those are Richie's friends.

07:15.789 --> 07:19.416
Vanessa and Diane.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.959
Diane?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.586
Wait, is tonight
Richie's birthday,

07:22.587 --> 07:24.380
the night of the
flaming sombrero?

07:24.381 --> 07:26.423
Yeah, yeah, it's
Richie's birthday,

07:26.424 --> 07:27.591
but I don't know
where you're getting

07:27.592 --> 07:29.343
"flaming sombrero" from, man.

07:29.344 --> 07:33.013
My God, this is the
night that my parents meet!

07:33.014 --> 07:34.890
Dude, whoa.

07:34.891 --> 07:36.600
Your parents never met?

07:36.601 --> 07:37.726
That's fucked up.

07:37.727 --> 07:39.645
‐You're fucked up. ‐You're fu‐‐.

07:39.646 --> 07:40.605
Whoa!

07:40.606 --> 07:43.316
Man, I have that‐‐
I have that jacket.

07:46.403 --> 07:47.403
Okay.

07:47.404 --> 07:48.445
So during your recon

07:48.446 --> 07:51.365
at the Rick Springfield
concert last summer,

07:51.366 --> 07:54.451
you ascertained there
were hallways here, here,

07:54.452 --> 07:56.537
and here, right?

07:56.538 --> 07:58.956
Yeah, I think so.

07:58.957 --> 08:00.874
Think or know, Debbie?

08:00.875 --> 08:03.502
‐Think or know? ‐Know, I know.

08:03.503 --> 08:06.213
So we draw their forces here

08:06.214 --> 08:07.798
with a diversionary tactic.

08:07.799 --> 08:09.508
I can show them my boobs.

08:09.509 --> 08:10.843
Tiffany, no!

08:10.844 --> 08:12.052
Stop pitching that.

08:12.053 --> 08:14.179
This is, like, way complicated.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.014
I can't do this anymore, I quit!

08:16.015 --> 08:18.559
Get your shit together, Amber.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.562
We are a team now,
there's no quitting, okay?

08:21.563 --> 08:25.149
I know that failure hurts
like a robocactus being

08:25.150 --> 08:26.984
jammed up your sphincter.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.986
But do you want to
know what hurts worse?

08:28.987 --> 08:30.612
Accepting failure,

08:30.613 --> 08:32.448
because when you accept failure,

08:32.448 --> 08:35.284
you are giving up on
yourself and your team.

08:35.284 --> 08:37.034
Okay, we are not going
to accept failure.

08:37.035 --> 08:39.288
And we are not going to let
that mound of gristle over there

08:39.289 --> 08:40.998
tell us that we
can't get backstage.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.750
We are going to get back up,

08:42.751 --> 08:44.543
we are going to
dust off our clits,

08:44.544 --> 08:47.337
and we are going to
complete this mission,

08:47.338 --> 08:48.589
so who's with me?

08:48.590 --> 08:50.340
‐Yes, me. ‐Yeah!

08:50.341 --> 08:51.508
I guess.

08:51.509 --> 08:53.093
‐Barry. ‐.

08:53.094 --> 08:54.595
What's your plan?

08:54.596 --> 08:56.722
Um, I don't know.

08:56.723 --> 08:58.682
Finish this and then
humiliate myself

08:58.683 --> 09:00.100
in front of some women?

09:00.101 --> 09:04.313
Barry, you need to go
get that AOL application

09:04.314 --> 09:06.774
and apply for that job.

09:06.775 --> 09:08.442
How did you know about that?

09:08.443 --> 09:09.860
I went through your garbage.

09:09.861 --> 09:11.487
‐You went‐‐
‐lt's something I do.

09:11.488 --> 09:13.113
But there's no money
in that, man, I mean,

09:13.114 --> 09:14.364
what, it's like stock options.

09:14.365 --> 09:16.241
What am I‐‐what good's
that going to do for me?

09:16.242 --> 09:19.536
Barry, I have to go,
but listen to me

09:19.537 --> 09:20.579
and listen good.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.498
You need to apply for that job,

09:22.499 --> 09:23.999
take those options,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.044
and get the fuck out before 4.0.

09:27.045 --> 09:28.588
Trust me.

09:30.590 --> 09:34.343
Hey, guys, what's going on?

09:34.344 --> 09:35.761
Okay, so here's the thing.

09:35.762 --> 09:38.889
I gotta head, but
I also gotta say

09:38.890 --> 09:41.350
that I like what I'm seeing.

09:41.351 --> 09:44.812
You were just the
most beautiful thing.

09:44.813 --> 09:46.063
You have, like,

09:46.064 --> 09:48.023
the smoothest skin
I've ever seen.

09:48.024 --> 09:52.945
Your skin is like that
of an angel's bottom.

09:52.946 --> 09:54.571
‐Thanks! ‐‐.

09:54.572 --> 09:58.617
Have you ever just
been in a moment where

09:58.618 --> 10:00.994
time just freezes

10:00.995 --> 10:03.413
and everything seems perfect?

10:03.414 --> 10:06.125
It's his first
time doing nitrous.

10:06.126 --> 10:07.835
‐ ‐lt is.

10:07.836 --> 10:10.337
It's not the nitrous
talking, though, my friend.

10:10.338 --> 10:14.174
You two are perfect.

10:14.175 --> 10:16.218
What about me?

10:16.219 --> 10:17.594
Yeah, you're‐‐you're fine.

10:17.595 --> 10:19.805
But this one, Gabey,
this one right here,

10:19.806 --> 10:23.600
this is the kind of woman
you have to hang on to

10:23.601 --> 10:26.562
and never, never let go of.

10:26.563 --> 10:29.898
The kind of woman that
could change your life.

10:29.899 --> 10:32.568
Okay, all right,
I got a boat to catch.

10:32.569 --> 10:35.070
Joosh out!

10:35.071 --> 10:38.282
Man.

10:38.283 --> 10:41.410
I like boats.

10:41.411 --> 10:43.620
Okay.

10:43.621 --> 10:46.207
Maybe I could change your life.

10:54.757 --> 10:55.841
Hey!

10:55.842 --> 10:57.175
Load‐in was two hours ago.

10:57.176 --> 10:59.219
What the hell are you doing here?

10:59.220 --> 11:01.721
This is where our paths diverge.

11:01.722 --> 11:02.807
What?

11:03.891 --> 11:04.725
What the hell's going on here?

11:04.726 --> 11:06.768
Run... you fools.

11:06.769 --> 11:08.855
Get 'em.

11:11.274 --> 11:13.150
I'm coming for you, Wolf.

11:13.151 --> 11:14.985
And this, this‐‐not happening.

11:14.986 --> 11:17.737
No way, a little too smart
to fall into that old trap.

11:17.738 --> 11:19.948
Now, you need to come with
me, young lady, come on.

11:19.949 --> 11:23.243
‐Jesus, chill out, spaz.
‐Yes, that's more like it.

11:23.244 --> 11:25.287
I'm repulsive I'm a spaz, okay?

11:25.288 --> 11:27.289
No.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.624
No, she's touching his forearm!

11:29.625 --> 11:31.835
Shit, what have I done?

11:31.836 --> 11:33.628
My god.

11:33.629 --> 11:35.630
Those two are so cute.

11:35.631 --> 11:38.050
Bet that's the last we're
seeing of them tonight.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.012
Shit, I'm Back to
the Futuring myself!

11:42.013 --> 11:42.972
Come on.

11:42.973 --> 11:44.014
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

11:44.015 --> 11:45.682
Gabe, can I just steal
you for a second?

11:45.683 --> 11:46.892
I'm actually kind of in
the middle of a thing.

11:46.893 --> 11:50.145
That's okay, come on,
just one quick moment.

11:50.146 --> 11:51.063
Okay.

11:51.064 --> 11:52.939
So I know that we just met

11:52.940 --> 11:54.107
and this might seem a
little bit weird to you,

11:54.108 --> 11:55.817
but trust me, I'm
really, really good

11:55.818 --> 11:56.902
with these kinds of things.

11:56.903 --> 11:57.986
We were just talking,

11:57.987 --> 12:01.907
and I think that you two
would be a dream together.

12:01.908 --> 12:03.742
You'd be perfect, okay?

12:03.743 --> 12:05.827
I don't know if it's, like,
your energies or your vibes

12:05.828 --> 12:07.746
or something, but it's...

12:07.747 --> 12:10.832
it's like a romance
written in the stars.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.000
Hey, man, they're all the same

12:12.001 --> 12:13.168
when you're finger blasting
them in the laundry room.

12:13.169 --> 12:14.586
My God, Dad, no.

12:14.587 --> 12:16.671
‐Doing the big one in the‐‐
‐Stop, stop, please!

12:16.672 --> 12:19.007
Okay, you just went from
the stars to the gutter.

12:19.008 --> 12:20.842
She's a lady,
treat her like one.

12:20.843 --> 12:22.010
Come on.

12:22.011 --> 12:23.888
Did you call me "Dad"?

12:38.069 --> 12:39.986
No, I changed my mind, Markita.

12:39.987 --> 12:41.948
Let's go ahead and
frost these tips.

12:45.993 --> 12:47.827
It's you.

12:47.828 --> 12:49.704
‐How'd you get in?
‐How'd you get in?

12:49.705 --> 12:52.874
Let's just say doors have
been opening for me lately.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.001
Don't even have to
blow them up anymore.

12:55.002 --> 12:56.878
So you're just going to

12:56.879 --> 13:01.007
throw away the future
of humanity, for what?

13:01.008 --> 13:03.928
Some... sea bugs?

13:05.054 --> 13:07.764
Those are Santa Barbara
spot prawns!

13:07.765 --> 13:09.392
They're seasonal.

13:11.018 --> 13:13.228
I'm done taking orders.

13:13.229 --> 13:16.815
I'm not giving you an order.

13:16.816 --> 13:19.025
There's no more orders, Wolf.

13:19.026 --> 13:20.902
No more team.

13:20.903 --> 13:23.780
No more chain of command.

13:23.781 --> 13:25.157
No more Resistance.

13:29.245 --> 13:30.954
What's your deal, Joosh?

13:30.955 --> 13:33.999
You've eaten, like,
a lot of cupcakes.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.792
You pulled me away
from that cute guy

13:35.793 --> 13:38.044
and now you won't
even talk to me.

13:38.045 --> 13:39.295
I'm sorry, okay?

13:39.296 --> 13:41.673
I've just got a lot
on my mind right now.

13:41.674 --> 13:44.676
I almost just fucked
up something major,

13:44.677 --> 13:47.095
and I can't leave here
until I make sure it's okay.

13:47.096 --> 13:50.098
Why are you so
obsessed with them?

13:50.099 --> 13:51.266
Isn't it obvious?

13:51.267 --> 13:53.810
I mean, look at how
they look at each other.

13:53.811 --> 13:55.854
How they laugh at
each other's dumb jokes,

13:55.855 --> 14:00.942
how they look past each
other's many, many flaws.

14:00.943 --> 14:02.193
They're in love.

14:02.194 --> 14:04.779
Beautiful, beautiful pure love.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.907
You can tell all of that?

14:07.908 --> 14:09.492
That's so sweet, Joosh.

14:09.493 --> 14:12.078
And let's be honest.

14:12.079 --> 14:15.081
You are way too cool for Gabe.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.000
‐ ‐You are.

14:17.001 --> 14:20.211
I mean, look at you, you
got like 30 bracelets here,

14:20.212 --> 14:25.091
you got like nine different
necklaces around your neck.

14:25.092 --> 14:27.469
You would eat him alive.

14:27.470 --> 14:30.222
Okay, he could not handle you.

14:33.601 --> 14:35.019
Can you?

14:36.937 --> 14:40.065
Throwing our lives away is not
going to bring our team back.

14:40.066 --> 14:44.152
Yeah, it is.

14:44.153 --> 14:45.820
If we succeed,

14:45.821 --> 14:48.823
we go back to the future,
the Biotics don't exist,

14:48.824 --> 14:50.992
and our team is still alive.

14:50.993 --> 14:51.993
Maybe.

14:51.994 --> 14:54.162
As different people
who don't know us

14:54.163 --> 14:55.330
or what we did,

14:55.331 --> 14:57.706
don't know the hell
they could've lived in.

14:57.707 --> 14:59.959
We'd be strangers in
a world we don't know

14:59.960 --> 15:01.835
or understand.

15:01.836 --> 15:04.255
That's the sacrifice
we signed up for.

15:08.843 --> 15:12.054
And yeah...

15:12.055 --> 15:14.014
maybe no one would know.

15:14.015 --> 15:15.891
But I'll know.

15:15.892 --> 15:17.851
And you'll know.

15:17.852 --> 15:20.020
And we'll have each other.

15:20.021 --> 15:22.023
That's enough for me.

15:30.991 --> 15:33.201
It's not enough for me.

15:34.285 --> 15:36.912
Wolf, let me out of here!

15:36.913 --> 15:40.040
You're going to
thank me for this.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.917
Wolf, Wolf!

15:41.918 --> 15:43.335
What the fuck are you doing?

15:43.336 --> 15:45.254
What I should have
done a long time ago:

15:45.255 --> 15:47.132
Destroying the TTD.

15:51.261 --> 15:53.053
I really‐‐I have to go.

15:53.054 --> 15:55.264
‐No, Joosh... ‐I can't.

15:55.265 --> 15:58.100
‐Just stay for a little bit.
‐Big things...

15:58.101 --> 15:59.268
Big things I have to go do,

15:59.269 --> 16:01.228
big things I have to go do.

16:01.229 --> 16:02.354
God.

16:02.355 --> 16:05.482
Looks like the yule log in
your pants want you to stay.

16:05.483 --> 16:06.859
Holy shit!

16:06.860 --> 16:09.069
You've got to let me
at least see this thing.

16:09.070 --> 16:11.071
My God!

16:11.072 --> 16:12.406
Yeah, Wolf!

16:12.407 --> 16:15.075
Wolf, is that what you call it?

16:15.076 --> 16:18.121
No, it's like another thing.

16:19.039 --> 16:20.414
Well, I like it.

16:20.415 --> 16:21.832
Thanks.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.125
I'm getting
a little lightheaded,

16:23.126 --> 16:26.087
all the blood is like,
gonna go, that's a lot of‐‐.

16:27.047 --> 16:29.089
Looking a little wobbly there.

16:29.090 --> 16:33.053
Maybe you want to
grab on to these.

16:35.096 --> 16:36.805
Hachi machi.

16:36.806 --> 16:41.310
So you ask the same question,
you get two different answers.

16:41.311 --> 16:42.853
Magic?

16:42.854 --> 16:43.813
I think not.

16:43.814 --> 16:47.149
Wow, you've given me
a lot to think about.

16:47.150 --> 16:48.901
Tell Diane I left.

16:48.902 --> 16:50.444
Vanessa, wait!

16:50.445 --> 16:51.987
Yes, Joosh!

16:51.988 --> 16:53.322
Joosh!

16:53.323 --> 16:56.284
‐Vanessa! ‐No, Diane.

16:59.037 --> 17:01.413
What?

17:01.414 --> 17:03.249
I'm not Vanessa, I'm Diane.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.292
No.

17:06.294 --> 17:07.461
‐No you're not. ‐Yeah.

17:07.462 --> 17:09.339
No, Vanessa's my friend.

17:11.174 --> 17:12.509
No, that would mean...

17:17.180 --> 17:20.265
God!

17:20.266 --> 17:22.227
Joosh.

17:25.355 --> 17:26.189
God, no!

17:26.190 --> 17:28.233
God, what did I do?

17:33.446 --> 17:34.488
That's it.

17:34.489 --> 17:36.448
You just get it all out.

17:36.449 --> 17:37.991
What happened to Joosh?

17:37.992 --> 17:40.077
Think he had a little too much.

17:40.078 --> 17:42.121
Been there, buddy.

17:42.122 --> 17:43.206
No you haven't.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.249
Can you just get his head?

17:45.250 --> 17:47.584
I'll wipe him down a little bit.

17:47.585 --> 17:50.212
‐Up, up... ‐Okay.

17:50.213 --> 17:51.463
Sorry.

17:51.464 --> 17:53.048
There it is, yeah!

17:53.049 --> 17:54.883
It's pretty scary
to get sick like that

17:54.884 --> 17:56.051
all of a sudden?

17:56.052 --> 17:58.137
Yeah, you're a real trooper.

17:58.138 --> 17:59.888
I'm sorry I threw
up in your bedroom.

17:59.889 --> 18:02.350
And I instantly forgive you.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.146
Thanks.

18:07.147 --> 18:10.107
Okay, I'm feeling much better.

18:10.108 --> 18:11.233
‐You are? ‐Yeah, I'm just going

18:11.234 --> 18:12.568
to get vertical.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.570
‐Okay. ‐Okay.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.155
You've got some on you.

18:16.156 --> 18:19.241
Yeah, I think it's cupcake.

18:19.242 --> 18:20.409
Cupcake?

18:20.410 --> 18:23.537
Well, it, um, it
looks good on you.

18:23.538 --> 18:25.080
‐Yeah...
‐I was supposed to tell you.

18:25.081 --> 18:30.169
Vanessa left, so I guess that
means you'll be leaving too.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.045
I don't know.

18:31.046 --> 18:33.964
Maybe we should ask
your Magic 8‐Ball.

18:33.965 --> 18:36.133
Yeah‐‐yes, let's...

18:36.134 --> 18:37.593
Um...

18:37.594 --> 18:39.052
‐ ‐

18:39.053 --> 18:40.971
You know, these things
are bullshit anyway.

18:40.972 --> 18:43.098
I say you should stay.

18:43.099 --> 18:45.226
Okay, then I'm staying.

18:52.484 --> 18:54.235
I'm coming for you, Kronish.

18:58.490 --> 19:01.618
I'm not dying in
this sunglass hut.

19:13.129 --> 19:15.339
Come with me if
you want to live.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.467
And I mean truly live.

19:21.221 --> 19:23.138
Goodbye, prawns.

19:23.139 --> 19:25.058
Goodbye, TTD.

19:27.143 --> 19:28.143
No!

19:31.523 --> 19:33.106
Don't try and stop me.

19:33.107 --> 19:35.734
Are you trying
to strand us here?

19:35.735 --> 19:38.487
No, not the car!

19:38.488 --> 19:40.239
Part of you wants to
stay here, I know it.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.074
Why else would you
take that DNA test?

19:42.075 --> 19:43.993
That was a mistake!

20:09.185 --> 20:11.353
I'm doing this for both of us.

20:11.354 --> 20:13.564
Wolf, you stupid motherfucker!

20:13.565 --> 20:15.525
Stand down!

20:32.375 --> 20:33.667
Okay.

20:33.668 --> 20:35.377
Okay, we're here.

20:35.378 --> 20:38.297
Now, will you tell me
who the hell you are

20:38.298 --> 20:41.049
and why you are so
violently supportive

20:41.050 --> 20:44.386
of my... homosexual lifestyle?

20:44.387 --> 20:45.346
You know what, Dr. K?

20:45.347 --> 20:47.222
I‐‐I really tried this
whole free will thing

20:47.223 --> 20:49.182
but it's not as
easy as it seems.

20:49.183 --> 20:50.767
All right, so here we are.

20:50.768 --> 20:52.311
Now, get on that boat.

20:52.312 --> 20:55.230
How do you even
know about the boat?

20:55.231 --> 20:56.858
That was a secret plan.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.234
Well, I know everything
about your secret plan.

20:59.235 --> 21:01.028
The Seychelles,
the conch fritters.

21:01.029 --> 21:02.237
Look, just trust me.

21:02.238 --> 21:04.406
Your life is going to be
much happier if you do that

21:04.407 --> 21:05.991
and don't stay
here with your wife.

21:05.992 --> 21:08.160
You're telling me
to throw my life away.

21:08.161 --> 21:09.661
No, I'm asking you
to change your life

21:09.662 --> 21:11.163
‐for the better.
‐What do you know?

21:11.164 --> 21:15.167
You have any idea what it's
like to be a gay black man

21:15.168 --> 21:16.418
in this world?

21:16.419 --> 21:17.337
Obviously, I don't.

21:17.338 --> 21:20.172
‐However...
‐Getting on that boat,

21:20.173 --> 21:22.174
I'm not just
throwing my life away,

21:22.175 --> 21:24.092
I'm throwing away my career,

21:24.093 --> 21:25.427
my social life, the church.

21:25.428 --> 21:26.720
Listen.

21:26.721 --> 21:29.431
Okay, the world is going to
get much better for gay people.

21:29.432 --> 21:30.474
Sort of.

21:30.475 --> 21:31.516
In some states.

21:31.517 --> 21:32.684
You're going to want
to stick to the coasts.

21:32.685 --> 21:34.019
But you've got a boat.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.271
‐So that's perfect.
‐What do you know?

21:36.272 --> 21:38.774
You're just a
crazy man with a gun!

21:38.775 --> 21:39.775
Help!

21:39.776 --> 21:41.652
Help, help!

21:41.653 --> 21:42.445
Help!

21:42.446 --> 21:45.280
This man is crazy, he's‐‐

21:45.281 --> 21:47.240
I'm not crazy!

21:47.241 --> 21:48.618
I'm from the future.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.501
I swear, I can prove it to you.

21:57.502 --> 21:59.294
Prove it to the sandman.

21:59.295 --> 22:01.630
You're going to sleep.

22:01.631 --> 22:05.635
This... this is us, this is us.

22:11.265 --> 22:12.265
What?

22:12.266 --> 22:14.435
What is this?

22:18.356 --> 22:19.856
Look.

22:19.857 --> 22:22.275
This...

22:22.276 --> 22:25.320
See that photo?

22:25.321 --> 22:27.240
Now look behind you.

22:31.369 --> 22:32.411
Look.

22:32.412 --> 22:35.622
That photo is hanging
on the wall of your office

22:35.623 --> 22:37.582
in 2017.

22:37.583 --> 22:40.502
I know that because
I work for you.

22:40.503 --> 22:42.713
And I have come a very long way

22:42.714 --> 22:44.340
to try to save you.

23:01.816 --> 23:04.359
Don't make me keep
doing this to you.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.487
I don't have any fight
left in me, Tiger.

23:07.488 --> 23:09.281
But I got a taste of freedom

23:09.282 --> 23:11.492
and there's no
coming back from that.

23:13.536 --> 23:16.580
I'm done.

23:16.581 --> 23:19.499
You can't be done, Wolf.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.420
I'm not Wolf anymore.

23:23.421 --> 23:26.382
You know what my name is.

23:35.725 --> 23:37.643
You're going to have to kill me.

23:39.562 --> 23:43.148
It's Resistance law.

23:43.149 --> 23:45.777
The punishment for
desertion is death.

23:49.363 --> 23:51.823
Go ahead.

23:51.824 --> 23:53.618
Just do it.

24:02.418 --> 24:04.669
So you're telling me you've been
back and forth through time,

24:04.670 --> 24:08.757
courting death just
to avoid killing me.

24:08.758 --> 24:10.425
Yeah.

24:10.426 --> 24:13.553
Which is why you have
to get on that boat.

24:13.554 --> 24:15.347
Because if you don't,

24:15.348 --> 24:18.725
my colleagues will
shoot you as a baby.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.268
And I can't protect you.

24:20.269 --> 24:22.854
So my big breakthrough
was possum semen?

24:22.855 --> 24:23.897
Really?

24:23.898 --> 24:26.650
Yeah, it's magical stuff.

24:26.651 --> 24:28.401
Look.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.445
I've broken every
rule of time travel

24:30.446 --> 24:33.615
by telling you all of this.

24:33.616 --> 24:37.285
I've also broken every rule
of God and man tonight.

24:37.286 --> 24:41.832
So please, please
get on that boat.

24:41.833 --> 24:44.627
You've sacrificed
so much to get here.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.550
The least I could do

24:51.551 --> 24:53.593
is sail away with
the love of my life

24:53.594 --> 24:56.847
and be happy forever.

24:56.848 --> 24:57.973
Wow.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.101
Yes, thank you.

25:07.483 --> 25:11.695
I am feeling strong and brave.

25:11.696 --> 25:13.406
Strong and brave.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.576
By the way.

25:17.577 --> 25:19.578
Marigold still thinks
I'm taking out the trash.

25:19.579 --> 25:21.621
‐So... ‐Don't worry.

25:21.622 --> 25:23.874
I'll take care of it.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.042
Bon voyage, Dr. K.

25:26.043 --> 25:27.712
Bye, Josh.

25:36.721 --> 25:38.764
Bon voyage.

26:07.793 --> 26:09.669
What happened?

26:09.670 --> 26:11.671
Where‐‐where's Wolf?

26:11.672 --> 26:12.714
He's gone.

26:12.715 --> 26:14.799
Gone.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.967
Wh‐‐what do you mean?

26:15.968 --> 26:17.969
He's just‐‐he's gone.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.596
Don't ask again.

26:19.597 --> 26:22.641
Holy shit.

26:22.642 --> 26:24.351
Are you okay?

26:24.352 --> 26:26.770
Did you get Kronish on the boat?

26:26.771 --> 26:28.104
Yeah.

26:28.105 --> 26:29.481
Yeah, I did.

26:29.482 --> 26:31.733
I think we finally
did it this time.

26:31.734 --> 26:32.817
Good.

26:32.818 --> 26:34.402
Now let's go.

26:34.403 --> 26:35.988
I fucking hate the '80s.

26:43.454 --> 26:44.830
Where'd your door go?

27:03.933 --> 27:05.475
Okay.

27:05.476 --> 27:07.936
Kronish Labs was built in 1992.

27:07.937 --> 27:10.772
If my plan worked and
we jump back to 2017,

27:10.773 --> 27:12.440
it won't be there.

27:12.441 --> 27:15.528
It's the only way this will
all be worth it.

27:17.988 --> 27:18.948
Shit.

27:18.949 --> 27:20.616
I forgot to tell Marigold.

27:52.857 --> 27:54.733
My God.

27:54.734 --> 27:55.775
We did it.

27:55.776 --> 27:56.736
It worked!

27:56.737 --> 27:58.194
Aha!

27:58.195 --> 27:59.821
Now, body part check.

27:59.822 --> 28:01.698
Anything changed?

28:01.699 --> 28:04.200
I think I am good.

28:04.201 --> 28:06.828
Tiger?

28:06.829 --> 28:07.997
Tiger?

28:13.794 --> 28:16.797
Any chance that's... good?

28:17.305 --> 28:23.179
