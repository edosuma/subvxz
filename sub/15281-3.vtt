00:21.655 --> 00:23.553
You want grapefruit or cranberry ?

00:23.605 --> 00:24.569
Coffee.

00:24.585 --> 00:25.957
Cranberry it is.

00:25.965 --> 00:27.293
Take it easy on the butter.

00:27.305 --> 00:29.100
Is half a stick too much ?

00:29.235 --> 00:31.840
Yeah, well, I'm just
following doctor's orders.

00:31.905 --> 00:33.779
It would be nice if you did the same.

00:33.865 --> 00:36.740
Hey, look. Laura sent the
pictures from her Orlando trip.

00:36.905 --> 00:40.016
I wonder if there are any of that
new guy that she's so crazy about.

00:40.198 --> 00:42.453
Oh, wait a minute. I thought she said...

00:42.503 --> 00:44.813
I thought she said
pictures, not a video.

00:44.824 --> 00:46.451
That's a DVD, Mary.

00:46.462 --> 00:49.197
Technology isn't slowing down.
It's actually passing you by.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.952
If you don't catch up soon, you'll
be as pitiful as your mother.

00:51.955 --> 00:53.320
That's motivation.

00:53.348 --> 00:55.070
Come on, Mary. I could
show you a few things.

00:55.085 --> 00:57.071
You afraid to be my student ?

00:57.788 --> 01:01.060
"Hi, guys. Just wanted to let you know
I'm having a great time. Miss you both."

01:01.076 --> 01:02.183
Sweet.

01:06.687 --> 01:08.150
Wait a minute. Is...

01:08.336 --> 01:10.202
Is that Laura ?

01:11.465 --> 01:13.050
It can't be.

01:13.885 --> 01:15.640
Frank, what's happening ?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.282
Oh... my God.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.313
This was sent to the family ?

01:28.565 --> 01:31.371
Father had a heart condition,
died while watching it.

01:43.425 --> 01:46.293
So... the music's not added
like a regular soundtrack.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.410
It's in the background,
so if you turn it down, you

01:48.426 --> 01:49.821
also turn down the voices.

01:49.825 --> 01:51.683
We get Garcia to separate
the audio tracks ?

01:51.696 --> 01:53.240
She's working on it now.

01:53.257 --> 01:55.030
The sooner we hear how
he talks to the victim,

01:55.037 --> 01:56.803
the sooner we'll know what
kind of man we're dealing with.

01:56.828 --> 01:59.003
- Tell us about Laura Clemensen.
- 20 years old.

01:59.016 --> 02:01.913
Sophomore at Jacksonville
University in Florida.

02:01.926 --> 02:04.622
Assumed to be the fifth in
a series of rapes and murders

02:04.638 --> 02:06.302
over the past two years.

02:06.308 --> 02:08.532
Some women were
abducted in parking lots,

02:08.567 --> 02:11.461
- others while they were running.
- And when was she reported missing ?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.033
Technically she wasn't.

02:13.047 --> 02:14.752
Roommate thought she
was visiting family.

02:14.756 --> 02:17.280
- Family thought she was at school.
- Close to her family ?

02:17.298 --> 02:19.473
Very. She had dinner
with them on sunday.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.410
That was 5 days ago, and
nobody's seen her until now.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.212
She wasn't killed on the tape.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.023
And given forensics,
other victims were tortured

02:26.037 --> 02:27.911
for weeks before they were killed, so

02:28.086 --> 02:30.101
I think we should operate
as if she's still alive.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.393
Not for long, if the
bastard gets his way.

02:32.688 --> 02:35.612
Okay, I don't get it. This
is the fifth abduction and now

02:35.845 --> 02:37.452
the second DVD.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.140
Why'd they wait to call us in ?

02:39.155 --> 02:42.041
The last victim's family
received this DVD two months ago.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.463
Jacksonville P.D. thought
maybe they'd get some more clues

02:44.467 --> 02:47.430
- instead of just raise more questions.
- Turn that down, please.

02:47.447 --> 02:49.820
There seems to be a natural
escalation to the murders.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.581
It... began as brutal
attacks against the victims,

02:52.598 --> 02:55.493
and now it's psychological
attacks to the families.

02:55.506 --> 02:58.212
So if the thrill of the
kill isn't enough to satisfy

02:58.236 --> 03:00.372
his sadistic needs, he
needs to spread panic,

03:00.387 --> 03:02.061
and he thrives on that.

03:02.077 --> 03:05.041
Sadistic killers are typically
strangers to their victims.

03:05.056 --> 03:06.930
It's easier for the offender to torture

03:06.947 --> 03:08.840
and kill someone that they don't know.

03:08.858 --> 03:10.550
Offenders.

03:13.558 --> 03:16.252
Man on the tape isn't
doing this just for himself.

03:17.415 --> 03:19.052
He's playing to an audience,

03:20.166 --> 03:21.732
not her family.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.650
Someone watching...

03:29.607 --> 03:32.410
who can appreciate what he's doing,

03:33.318 --> 03:35.853
admire his sadistic skills.

03:35.897 --> 03:38.193
It is a characteristic
of partners to record

03:38.208 --> 03:40.800
their crimes so they can
relive the fantasy later.

03:40.818 --> 03:42.673
How can we be sure ?

03:45.705 --> 03:47.581
Right there. The camera moves.

03:53.627 --> 03:56.503
One guy tortures while
the other records it.

03:57.798 --> 03:59.572
Master and servant.

03:59.586 --> 04:02.421
Jacksonville P.D.'s been looking
for this killer for years.

04:02.766 --> 04:05.151
How long is it gonna
take'em to find a team ?

04:50.027 --> 04:51.491
<i>Mark Twain wrote :</i>

04:51.546 --> 04:53.091
<i>"Of all the animals,</i>

04:53.106 --> 04:55.681
<i>man is the only one that is cruel.</i>

04:55.705 --> 04:58.251
<i>He is the only one that inflicts pain</i>

04:58.274 --> 05:00.310
<i>for the pleasure of doing it."</i>

05:00.817 --> 05:01.749
Again.

05:02.574 --> 05:04.251
That's the third time he's
looked back at the camera.

05:04.264 --> 05:06.332
He's looking back at his partner.

05:06.355 --> 05:08.321
These two are clearly
deranged and acting out

05:08.334 --> 05:10.012
their worst sadistic fantasies.

05:10.036 --> 05:11.900
Folie à deux.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.782
Rare psychological phenomenon

05:14.944 --> 05:18.071
in which two or more people
share the same psychotic delusion.

05:18.425 --> 05:20.739
In its literal translation, yes, but

05:20.767 --> 05:23.201
it often refers to the bond
that exists between two people

05:23.205 --> 05:25.059
that bring out the worst in each other.

05:25.087 --> 05:28.039
Most killing teams have
a dominant personality

05:28.385 --> 05:30.010
that instigates and plans

05:30.026 --> 05:32.691
and a submissive one
who's the eager accomplice.

05:33.165 --> 05:35.471
So how do they decide who gets to kill ?

05:35.505 --> 05:38.081
Well, the dominant one will
usually insist on taking the life.

05:38.107 --> 05:40.459
So what's the psychology
behind making these DVDs ?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.322
It's a shared souvenir,

05:42.557 --> 05:44.990
allows the dominant to keep
the submissive one motivated,

05:44.994 --> 05:47.642
- loyal, and aroused.
- It's also about control.

05:48.174 --> 05:49.892
Built-in insurance
policy for blackmail,

05:49.907 --> 05:51.522
just in case somebody gets cold feet.

05:51.534 --> 05:54.672
It makes you wonder what might have
happened if these 2 people never had met.

05:54.904 --> 05:57.421
Chances are the women
would still be alive.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.351
<i>Jacksonville P.D. just
located Laura Clemensen's body.</i>

06:01.794 --> 06:03.719
<i>Some hikers found her under a bridge.</i>

06:06.235 --> 06:08.462
They never hide them.
They're always easy to find.

06:08.477 --> 06:10.540
Laura Clemensen wasn't
missing for more than a week.

06:10.556 --> 06:13.361
The time spent torturing's
getting shorter.

06:13.366 --> 06:16.220
<i>- Has her mother been notified ?
- No. Not yet.</i>

06:16.617 --> 06:18.511
We can cover more ground if we split up.

06:18.517 --> 06:20.930
Morgan and I'll meet
local P.D. at the scene.

06:20.944 --> 06:23.092
I'll talk to Laura Clemensen's mother,

06:23.094 --> 06:25.282
- and since she just lost her husband...
- I'll go with you.

06:25.296 --> 06:26.962
I'll start with the victimology, maybe

06:26.976 --> 06:29.349
find the reason why
these women were targeted.

06:31.677 --> 06:33.859
After Frank and I watched that video,

06:33.877 --> 06:35.151
I knew.

06:37.026 --> 06:39.660
At least she isn't suffering... anymore.

06:42.275 --> 06:44.422
Is there anything that
we can do for you ?

06:47.195 --> 06:48.419
Frank...

06:48.565 --> 06:51.502
gave Laura a pearl and
diamond ring for graduation.

06:51.517 --> 06:53.049
Could I get it back ?

06:53.067 --> 06:54.859
I will look into that right away.

06:54.877 --> 06:56.189
Thank you.

06:56.237 --> 06:59.240
As part of our investigation,
we're trying to gain some insight

06:59.907 --> 07:01.492
into your daughter, and...

07:01.494 --> 07:03.979
I wondered whether she was...

07:04.496 --> 07:07.279
shy and quiet, or was she more outgoing

07:07.296 --> 07:08.810
and made friends easily ?

07:08.827 --> 07:10.762
I mean, is this really important ?

07:10.774 --> 07:13.171
Yes, ma'am. I know
that this is hard, but

07:13.997 --> 07:16.672
the more similarities we
can find between the victims,

07:16.687 --> 07:19.072
the more it'll help us
narrow down who's responsible.

07:24.735 --> 07:28.349
Frank had a ball in her hand
from the minute she could walk.

07:30.332 --> 07:31.922
She was confident.

07:33.043 --> 07:35.110
She knew everybody at school.

07:37.841 --> 07:41.406
She thought of our oldest,
Patrick, as her best friend.

07:42.507 --> 07:45.199
You know, she was like
most girls her age.

07:45.217 --> 07:47.211
She wanted everybody to like her.

07:52.496 --> 07:53.741
Frank used to

07:53.757 --> 07:55.971
think that she was too
much of a people pleaser,

07:55.985 --> 08:00.272
but I think it shows
a really good heart.

08:01.757 --> 08:03.051
I do, too.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.962
The police told us
that they may have a-

08:07.625 --> 08:10.491
they may have a witness who saw
Laura giving someone directions.

08:10.505 --> 08:12.931
Does that sound like
something she would have done ?

08:13.184 --> 08:15.390
We raised our children to be...

08:16.474 --> 08:19.160
helpful and kind and...

08:19.334 --> 08:22.900
and that made Laura an
easy target for a killer ?

08:23.727 --> 08:26.591
You have to know that you and Frank

08:26.644 --> 08:28.732
did everything right.

08:28.746 --> 08:31.561
Frank was supposed to be at
work yesterday, and if Laura...

08:31.586 --> 08:34.989
if Laura hadn't driven back
to campus that night, I mean,

08:35.816 --> 08:38.990
this wasn't supposed to happen.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.859
This wasn't...

08:57.577 --> 08:59.699
Special agents Gideon and Morgan.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.489
Detective Robert Portillo.

09:01.514 --> 09:03.859
This is the fifth girl on my
watch in the past two years,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.960
and we still don't
have a viable suspect.

09:06.844 --> 09:10.250
- We think you're looking for two men.
- Really ? Based upon what evidence ?

09:12.055 --> 09:14.621
Well, given the level of
sadistic torture and desire

09:14.636 --> 09:16.650
to document their crimes,

09:17.344 --> 09:20.119
we're confident this was
done by a killing team.

09:22.385 --> 09:25.471
She's got deep lacerations on
her neck, chest, and thighs.

09:26.195 --> 09:29.260
From the color of the bruising,
torture went on for several days.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.929
CSI believes the cause of death was

09:32.056 --> 09:33.990
ligature strangulation, and

09:34.115 --> 09:36.200
it is consistent with the other victims.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.350
In the video,

09:38.714 --> 09:41.061
she's wearing a pearl
ring on her left hand.

09:41.075 --> 09:42.779
No other evidence has turned up.

09:42.784 --> 09:45.440
They've combed the area,
quarter-mile radius.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.819
Why would they need
more trophies, Gideon ?

09:47.826 --> 09:49.722
Maybe passed it along as a gift.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.462
Like the green river killer ?

09:51.475 --> 09:52.679
Yeah.

09:53.127 --> 09:54.910
He'd leave jewelry for
his female coworkers

09:54.926 --> 09:57.340
and then become aroused
when he saw them wear it.

09:58.026 --> 09:59.479
After everything they do to these girls,

09:59.497 --> 10:01.660
why do they leave'em in
these horrible positions ?

10:01.675 --> 10:03.501
Haven't they suffered enough ?

10:03.765 --> 10:05.189
Apparently not.

10:05.654 --> 10:08.361
This is the ultimate degradation
to the victim and her family.

10:08.365 --> 10:10.651
Shock value for whoever finds them.

10:11.145 --> 10:13.460
And it sends a message to the police.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.702
- What's that ?
- "Look what we can do.

10:17.104 --> 10:18.891
You can't stop us."

10:26.607 --> 10:29.371
- Are there new victims ?
- Garcia just sent a list over

10:29.385 --> 10:32.320
of all the unsolved rapes and
murders in the past three years.

10:32.336 --> 10:34.911
There are two that are
particularly interesting.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.001
They look the type. Anything else ?

10:37.096 --> 10:40.031
Well, aside from sharing
similar physical traits,

10:40.246 --> 10:41.661
they were also posed.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.692
The only difference is they
were manually strangled,

10:43.696 --> 10:45.542
which I think is why Jacksonville P.D.

10:45.555 --> 10:48.501
- didn't find a connection.
- We find DNA on the first two ?

10:48.615 --> 10:51.392
That's the thing. It didn't
match the recent kills,

10:51.657 --> 10:52.852
but check this out.

10:52.876 --> 10:55.692
What if the dominant one
allowed the submissive one

10:55.706 --> 10:58.081
to rape the first 2 victims in
order to sort of draw him in,

10:58.095 --> 11:00.940
and then once he's hooked, he began
keeping the prize all for himself ?

11:00.955 --> 11:03.480
- You tell Morgan and Gideon about this yet ?
- They're still at the crime scene.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.811
We confirmed that Laura
Clemensen had good relationships

11:05.826 --> 11:07.912
with her family and
friends. She got good grades

11:07.926 --> 11:10.799
- and stayed out of trouble.
- Just like all the other victims.

11:10.807 --> 11:12.612
Did you guys notice that

11:12.627 --> 11:15.512
the package sent to the Clemensen
family was only sent to Mary ?

11:16.536 --> 11:18.130
What about the first DVD ?

11:20.126 --> 11:21.290
Right here.

11:22.906 --> 11:25.030
Why are they targeting the mothers ?

11:26.117 --> 11:27.860
The mother asked God

11:27.876 --> 11:30.082
to forgive the people responsible.

11:30.187 --> 11:31.142
And ?

11:31.145 --> 11:32.911
The family that received the first DVD

11:32.925 --> 11:35.302
went on TV pleading for
their daughter's life.

11:35.306 --> 11:36.840
That must have made the unsubs angry.

11:36.857 --> 11:39.321
So sending the DVD to the
mother is a message in itself.

11:39.324 --> 11:43.230
- A very clear one.
- They don't want or need forgiveness.

11:50.326 --> 11:52.950
- How do you get to the freeway ?
- If you go back out to Warner

11:52.966 --> 11:55.199
and make a right, you'll see
the exit in about half a mile.

11:55.217 --> 11:57.239
- Thanks.
- No problem.

12:09.974 --> 12:12.188
We're up to 7 victims now ?

12:13.774 --> 12:16.510
The humiliating posing of the
body can't be a coincidence.

12:16.524 --> 12:18.329
It's just too unique.

12:19.294 --> 12:21.098
The bruising on the necks.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.000
Looks to me like the
first victim struggled.

12:24.012 --> 12:25.990
I'd say the killer probably
lost his grip a couple times

12:26.005 --> 12:28.537
- and really had to fight these women.
- That's why he switched from bare hands

12:28.554 --> 12:30.990
to a ligature. It's more
efficient, controlled,

12:31.005 --> 12:33.980
and it doesn't sacrifice his
sadistic need for a slow death.

12:33.995 --> 12:35.530
Because the DNA didn't match,

12:35.545 --> 12:37.559
Jacksonville P.D. just
didn't put it together.

12:37.573 --> 12:40.939
Yeah, and since the weren't
looking for 2 offenders...

12:42.205 --> 12:44.448
signature indicates these
women had the same killers.

12:44.454 --> 12:46.079
We just need to figure
out who the hell they are.

12:46.093 --> 12:48.227
Well, Jacksonville P.D.
searched everywhere,

12:48.263 --> 12:50.729
even swamps, and still didn't
find the victims'vehicles.

12:50.735 --> 12:52.938
I got Garcia tracing VINs,
but my guess is they dispose

12:52.953 --> 12:55.810
- of the cars just like they do the women.
- Yeah, but the bodies are easy to find.

12:55.824 --> 12:58.350
Why do they go to so much
trouble to hide the cars ?

13:00.265 --> 13:02.980
I didn't think it could get
any hotter than yesterday.

13:02.992 --> 13:05.210
Today's a record breaker,
and the A.C.'s busted.

13:05.213 --> 13:06.399
Sorry about the fans.

13:06.402 --> 13:08.990
They're probably spreading
more dust than cool air.

13:09.003 --> 13:11.627
Well, we won't keep
your officers too long.

13:14.492 --> 13:17.100
That's not to say that
the submissive partner

13:17.112 --> 13:18.958
is in any way pure

13:18.975 --> 13:21.020
or innocent in this exchange.

13:21.555 --> 13:24.430
If their criminal desire wasn't present,

13:25.373 --> 13:27.430
their partnership wouldn't work.

13:27.582 --> 13:29.488
The offenders share a common delusion.

13:29.513 --> 13:32.360
It's one that you and I would never
accept, but it's this bond that

13:32.374 --> 13:34.340
justifies their actions.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.198
So we're looking for two sick
minds who complete each other.

13:37.212 --> 13:39.148
It's kind of like the perfect storm.

13:39.163 --> 13:41.167
Once these deviant
personalities collide,

13:41.185 --> 13:43.109
they're deadly and unstoppable.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.950
Like the D.C. snipers or
the Columbine assassins.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.999
Sometimes they've met in childhood.

13:49.093 --> 13:51.498
Other times, they can be related,
like the Hillside stranglers,

13:51.504 --> 13:53.830
Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi,

13:54.392 --> 13:57.440
psychopathic cousins who
terrorized women in Los Angeles.

13:57.985 --> 14:00.898
The dominant partner makes the
submissive one feel invincible.

14:00.912 --> 14:03.347
That's his reward
for doing as he's told.

14:04.965 --> 14:07.697
Unfortunately there are
countless opportunities

14:07.973 --> 14:10.187
for these twisted minds to meet,

14:10.194 --> 14:12.678
and once they've pulled
off their vicious acts,

14:12.682 --> 14:14.557
the two accept this as common behavior

14:14.574 --> 14:16.759
and become bored with normal activity.

14:16.762 --> 14:18.938
They live only for their new reality.

14:20.213 --> 14:22.750
They're obsessed with
it, addicted to it.

14:23.623 --> 14:25.707
And there's a fierce
loyalty between the two.

14:26.702 --> 14:29.078
The submissive one, however,
is usually less intelligent

14:29.095 --> 14:32.190
and easier to catch, and once
caught, he is easier to turn.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.720
Lack of remorse

14:33.733 --> 14:36.359
increases their aggressiveness.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.058
Sexual sadists will
stop when they're caught.

14:39.085 --> 14:41.409
And the need to psychologically
torture the families

14:41.422 --> 14:43.277
Sorry to interrupt.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.300
<i>If you've seen my daughter,</i>

14:45.945 --> 14:46.929
<i>please,</i>

14:47.484 --> 14:49.369
<i>Tiffany's all I have.</i>

14:50.385 --> 14:52.639
<i>She went for a run last night,</i>

14:52.654 --> 14:54.609
<i>and she never came home.</i>

14:55.192 --> 14:56.647
<i>She's my baby.</i>

14:56.663 --> 14:59.089
Why weren't we told about this
before she went on the news ?

14:59.092 --> 15:00.697
'Cause we didn't know about it.

15:00.715 --> 15:02.649
Tiffany was abducted from Middleberg.

15:02.672 --> 15:04.108
That's nearly an hour away,

15:04.274 --> 15:06.607
and it's outside of
Jacksonville's jurisdiction.

15:06.793 --> 15:08.588
Are you sure these are
the same offenders ?

15:08.604 --> 15:12.068
She's their type. Grabbed her while
jogging, just like their third victim.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.849
- Middleberg's only an hour from here ?
- If they see this,

15:14.862 --> 15:16.868
it's just a matter of time
before they send a DVD.

15:16.873 --> 15:18.440
Jennifer Jareau, FBI.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.930
You just aired a press
conference with Beverly Spears.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.577
I need to speak to her immediately.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.387
These guys are impatient.

15:24.402 --> 15:27.217
They just dumped Laura
Clemensen's body 24 hours ago.

15:27.263 --> 15:29.247
Which means they're more
dangerous than they were yesterday,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.117
and Tiffany Spears is
running out of time.

15:38.183 --> 15:40.000
You okay ? Am I okay ?

15:40.354 --> 15:42.428
Let me see. I've got images

15:42.432 --> 15:44.960
of a girl being tortured
burned inside my brain over

15:44.973 --> 15:47.767
<i>the strains of this
once-carefree choice of music.</i>

15:47.782 --> 15:50.058
I've isolated 4 sources from one track,

15:50.063 --> 15:51.839
and each one is more
distorted than the next,

15:51.845 --> 15:53.400
so no, I am not okay,

15:53.423 --> 15:54.728
<i>and it's gonna take awhile.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:55.850
Penelope,

15:55.854 --> 15:57.610
you know I appreciate you doing this.

15:57.763 --> 16:00.659
Thank you, sugar. For right
now, even that doesn't feel good.

16:02.054 --> 16:03.347
Moving on.

16:03.355 --> 16:05.437
Some of these victims were
abducted while driving.

16:05.454 --> 16:08.087
It does leave a nice trail,
especially when all the parts

16:08.102 --> 16:10.308
<i>lead you to Trevor's
used auto in Georgia.</i>

16:10.322 --> 16:12.330
No wonder Jacksonville P.D.
couldn't find the vehicles.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.927
The unsubs didn't drive the cars.

16:13.953 --> 16:17.007
<i>- They destroyed them and sold the parts.
- Yeah, and over state lines.</i>

16:17.025 --> 16:19.038
These sickos are good.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.358
Parts were found in Georgia.

16:26.082 --> 16:29.129
Sales were traced to a Joey Davin,
who lives right here in Jacksonville.

16:29.893 --> 16:32.109
Joseph P. Davin, 27.

16:34.195 --> 16:36.858
In and out of jail since he was 17.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.797
Number of charges,

16:39.282 --> 16:41.410
including car theft with a partner.

16:41.425 --> 16:43.860
Maybe he likes to team up. Either
way, he hasn't learned his lesson.

16:43.864 --> 16:47.310
- Doesn't sound too smart to me.
- Exactly why he needs a good leader.

16:50.562 --> 16:53.017
If it is proof that
Tiffany is still alive,

16:53.023 --> 16:55.237
still breathing, I need to see it.

16:55.263 --> 16:56.460
Ma'am, you don't understand.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.277
Do you remember what Tiffany was wearing

16:58.284 --> 17:00.068
the last time you saw her ?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.658
I told the police she
was going for a run.

17:03.035 --> 17:05.160
Sneakers, tank, shorts.

17:06.044 --> 17:07.858
Well, you need to think of her like this

17:07.865 --> 17:09.200
until we get her back.

17:09.214 --> 17:11.498
You don't need to see
what's on that DVD.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.919
I was supposed to have
run with her yesterday.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.280
I should have been there.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.527
Help her.

17:24.032 --> 17:25.897
Please, God.

17:27.321 --> 17:28.750
Help her.

17:37.162 --> 17:40.030
<i>Investigators are connecting
Tiffany Spears'disappearance</i>

17:40.032 --> 17:41.999
<i>with those of the five other victims,</i>

17:42.012 --> 17:44.198
<i>murdered in the Jacksonville area,</i>

17:44.215 --> 17:45.598
<i>including Laura Clemensen,</i>

17:45.615 --> 17:47.548
<i>whose body was found yesterday.</i>

17:47.575 --> 17:50.127
<i>Three of the victims'cars
are still missing.</i>

17:50.152 --> 17:51.970
<i>Investigators believe if they can find</i>

17:51.983 --> 17:53.467
<i>who took those cars,</i>

17:53.753 --> 17:55.817
<i>they will find the killer responsible.</i>

18:03.443 --> 18:04.408
FBI.

18:05.805 --> 18:07.378
And what can I do for you ?

18:07.385 --> 18:10.439
- We're looking for Joseph Davin.
- What did Joey do now ?

18:14.283 --> 18:15.229
Sir,

18:15.524 --> 18:17.287
we really need to talk to Joey.

18:19.773 --> 18:21.279
You Joseph Davin ?

18:22.493 --> 18:23.929
Get out of my way.

18:25.023 --> 18:27.288
- Joey, don't be stupid !
- I saw it on TV.

18:27.302 --> 18:29.240
Three strikes, and I'm
out. I'm not goin'back.

18:29.245 --> 18:33.008
I'm not going down for
this. Put the weapon down.

18:33.365 --> 18:35.358
Put it down now !

18:37.743 --> 18:38.780
Joey !

18:45.593 --> 18:47.337
Oh, Joey !

18:49.454 --> 18:51.157
Why didn't he put down the gun ?

18:51.162 --> 18:53.077
He didn't want that third strike.

18:54.403 --> 18:55.920
I didn't have a choice.

18:56.574 --> 18:59.469
And he was our closest link
to finding Tiffany Spears.

19:15.043 --> 19:16.497
Can't this wait ?

19:17.163 --> 19:19.087
Mr. Davin, there have
been seven women raped

19:19.100 --> 19:20.968
and murdered in the Jacksonville area.

19:20.983 --> 19:22.615
We can tie Joe to three of them.

19:22.631 --> 19:25.806
I thought by forcing him to move back in
here, it would keep him out of trouble.

19:26.281 --> 19:27.956
How long had your son been living here ?

19:27.981 --> 19:30.816
Two years. After the
M.S. put me in a chair.

19:31.050 --> 19:33.028
Was he still running with
his boys from prison ?

19:33.063 --> 19:35.645
He works at a garage
with a bunch of ex-cons.

19:36.450 --> 19:39.548
I tried so hard. I just couldn't
get him out of that world.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.278
I kept telling him,

19:41.613 --> 19:43.497
"you're better than all this."

19:44.252 --> 19:45.578
Agent Gideon,

19:45.741 --> 19:47.326
we just found this.

19:49.163 --> 19:51.867
Your son have a friend or
girlfriend with long, blond hair ?

19:53.450 --> 19:55.346
Not that I know of, no.

19:55.363 --> 19:57.595
Is it possible that you
wouldn't know if you did ?

19:57.700 --> 19:59.137
After today...

20:00.231 --> 20:01.966
nothing would surprise me.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.285
The dominant one wouldn't
have panicked like that.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.425
He would have come at us shooting
and gone down in a blaze of glory.

20:07.441 --> 20:09.227
So where's the other
half of this partnership ?

20:09.242 --> 20:11.018
Witnesses saw a white minivan, correct ?

20:11.031 --> 20:13.116
That one's Henry's. It's
got handicapped plates.

20:13.131 --> 20:15.415
You see any signs in Henry's behavior
that he could be part of this ?

20:15.430 --> 20:18.015
- Nah.
- But if Joey drives the van, then

20:18.033 --> 20:20.095
he can drive while his
partner snatches the girls.

20:20.111 --> 20:22.387
Have your men process the van.
If there's anything in there

20:22.402 --> 20:25.267
that doesn't belong to Joe or
Henry Davin, I wanna know about it.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.238
So,

20:28.422 --> 20:30.048
how does Joe meet his partner ?

20:30.191 --> 20:32.756
Well, his father said he hangs with
a bunch of ex-cons at the garage.

20:32.771 --> 20:34.208
Yeah. It's in...

20:34.602 --> 20:36.838
It's in Springfield. I'll
have Hotch check it out.

20:36.851 --> 20:39.086
If he's still hanging
with ex-cons, he...

20:39.300 --> 20:41.608
- probably talks to his old cellmate.
- Yeah.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.785
Find out who that is. Okay.

20:45.553 --> 20:46.846
This better be hella good.

20:46.992 --> 20:48.035
Garcia ?

20:48.093 --> 20:49.105
<i>Hello.</i>

20:49.142 --> 20:50.468
Yes, sir. I'm here.

20:50.491 --> 20:53.427
<i>I'm sorry. I just... I
wasn't... I'm surprised</i>

20:53.440 --> 20:55.337
that you're calling me.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.766
I need to know who Joseph
Davin shared a cell with.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.656
Yes. Sure.

21:00.672 --> 21:02.386
It was a guy...

21:02.930 --> 21:04.126
named...

21:12.230 --> 21:14.666
His name was Tony Canardo.
They were in together

21:14.681 --> 21:17.225
for 18 months, and both
were released 3 years ago.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.357
Before the killings started.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.446
Is that it ?

21:20.463 --> 21:23.078
His current address is 865
Kentwood in Jacksonville.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.768
- That's all you got ?
- yeah.

21:24.782 --> 21:26.905
- Garcia...
- Yes.

21:27.131 --> 21:28.606
You did great work.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.286
Keep it up.

21:30.691 --> 21:33.428
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

21:35.202 --> 21:37.535
Look, I got two guys out
today. I can't help you.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.006
- But my car's still leaking oil.
- Do you still have a receipt ?

21:40.022 --> 21:41.996
- It was less than a month ago.
- Do you have your receipt ?

21:42.011 --> 21:43.116
Excuse me.

21:43.390 --> 21:45.035
I'm with a customer.

21:46.102 --> 21:47.276
All right.

21:48.162 --> 21:49.905
What can you tell me about Joe Davin ?

21:49.913 --> 21:52.295
- I can tell you I fired him last week.
- Why ?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.316
He wasn't very good at his job.

21:55.412 --> 21:57.645
He was shot this morning
by Jacksonville police.

21:57.661 --> 22:00.485
- Sorry to hear that.
- You seem real upset by the news.

22:00.491 --> 22:02.878
I already had another
guy to take his place.

22:02.891 --> 22:04.586
You didn't waste any time, did you ?

22:04.601 --> 22:06.617
His ex-con buddies
were always at the shop.

22:06.621 --> 22:08.577
- It's bad for business.
- You're an ex-con.

22:08.591 --> 22:10.875
- I was innocent.
- Yeah. They all are.

22:11.343 --> 22:12.687
You know this guy ?

22:14.341 --> 22:15.805
That's T-bone.

22:15.821 --> 22:17.787
Name's Tony Canardo.

22:17.820 --> 22:19.718
He ran with Joey's crowd.

22:19.732 --> 22:22.068
This is one of the ex-cons
that you were talking about ?

22:22.082 --> 22:25.618
Yeah. When Tony's around,
Joey's not taking orders from me,

22:25.873 --> 22:28.636
and I can't have too many cooks in
the kitchen. You know what I mean ?

22:29.171 --> 22:30.335
We do.

22:31.431 --> 22:34.027
Look, I gotta get back to work.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.766
Well, Joey was just surrounded
by dominant personalities.

22:42.781 --> 22:45.765
If Mike Kroger was the killer, you'd
think he'd try to hide it better.

22:46.223 --> 22:47.997
We'll have Garcia run his sheet.

22:57.370 --> 22:58.807
Who are you guys ?

22:58.830 --> 23:01.116
- Mrs. Canardo.
- Yes.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.285
Can we come in ?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.328
Everything okay ?

23:15.370 --> 23:16.695
You tell me.

23:17.461 --> 23:19.886
- We're looking for your husband.
- He's not home.

23:19.892 --> 23:22.867
Well, he spent time in prison
with a man named Joseph Davin.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.497
Do you know him ?

23:24.661 --> 23:27.485
- Yeah, I know Joey.
- Joey's dead.

23:28.692 --> 23:30.206
Oh, my God. What happened ?

23:30.222 --> 23:31.988
He pulled a gun when we
were trying to question him.

23:31.991 --> 23:33.707
- About what ?
- Seven young women

23:33.721 --> 23:36.487
in the Jacksonville area
who've been raped and killed.

23:36.660 --> 23:38.145
Did you know him well ?

23:39.732 --> 23:41.976
He and my husband did time together.

23:42.432 --> 23:44.476
When Tony got out on
good behavior, he...

23:44.620 --> 23:46.555
tried to turn his life around,

23:47.083 --> 23:48.505
stay clean.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.295
How's he doing ?

23:51.771 --> 23:52.827
Okay.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.128
Some of those are mine.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.607
Tony ever get into trouble

23:59.620 --> 24:01.656
or do anything that
scares you when he drinks ?

24:01.662 --> 24:03.307
Only when he's around Joey.

24:03.313 --> 24:05.747
Those two get together, I'm
afraid of what could happen.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.767
Do you know where we can find Tony now ?

24:07.782 --> 24:09.238
He's getting off work.

24:09.243 --> 24:10.676
He should be home soon.

24:10.690 --> 24:13.698
Is there anyplace you can go ?'Cause
we're gonna need to talk to him.

24:16.671 --> 24:18.415
I can call my friend Kim.

24:21.850 --> 24:24.647
You wanna drive me down to the
station ? Can you wait here for Tony ?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.237
Did you run Mike Kroger's
sheet, the guy from the garage ?

24:30.250 --> 24:32.877
The boy needs a refresher
course in anger management.

24:32.883 --> 24:35.947
Okay, we got assault and battery.
We got assault with a deadly weapon.

24:35.962 --> 24:38.166
There's one attempted rape, but it
was dropped, because the poor thing was

24:38.182 --> 24:40.336
too scared to testify
against Mr. Stinky.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.345
Where was he when Tiffany
Spears was abducted ?

24:42.350 --> 24:44.298
His credit card says Miami,

24:44.313 --> 24:46.257
but not all of his alibis check out,

24:46.272 --> 24:48.065
and you know if there
is one loose thread,

24:48.083 --> 24:51.138
I will find it, I will pull it, and
his story will completely unravel.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.568
A tout à l'heure.

24:56.273 --> 24:59.455
Garcia's checking Mike Kroger's
whereabouts when the women were abducted.

24:59.773 --> 25:01.615
Some of his alibis already check out.

25:01.631 --> 25:03.165
What about Tony Canardo ?

25:03.201 --> 25:05.377
Morgan's still outside
his house waiting.

25:05.393 --> 25:06.345
Excuse me.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.746
Agent Gideon, there's someone
here who wants to talk to you.

25:14.122 --> 25:15.717
Mrs. Canardo.

25:16.591 --> 25:18.137
What happened ?

25:19.403 --> 25:21.145
After you left, I got nervous,

25:21.162 --> 25:23.147
so I went to find Tony.

25:23.462 --> 25:24.727
Please, sit down.

25:24.743 --> 25:27.905
And he... he knew
something was up, so...

25:29.292 --> 25:30.975
You got a kleenex ?

25:30.992 --> 25:32.466
What'd you tell him ?

25:32.481 --> 25:34.267
Well, I told him the truth,

25:34.280 --> 25:36.437
that the FBI was asking questions.

25:36.453 --> 25:38.125
So he hit you ?

25:38.142 --> 25:41.005
I wasn't completely
honest with you about Tony.

25:41.421 --> 25:43.355
He fell off the wagon a while ago.

25:43.371 --> 25:45.727
I just was afraid to say something.

25:45.743 --> 25:48.088
I didn't wanna betray
him. He's my husband.

25:48.530 --> 25:51.185
No, it's... it's good
that you're here with us.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.086
You're safe here.

25:53.292 --> 25:56.047
I'm gonna go tell Portillo and
Hotch that they should meet Morgan.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.446
- Mrs. Canardo, can I ask you a question ?
- Yes.

26:00.013 --> 26:01.637
Is that ring new ?

26:03.010 --> 26:05.317
Tony won some money playing poker.

26:05.352 --> 26:07.157
He bought it as a gift.

26:09.412 --> 26:12.447
- Why ?
- Looks a lot like Laura Clemensen's.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.585
- Big mistake.
- Come on !

27:26.781 --> 27:28.897
- Morgan !
- Yeah ! Right here !

27:29.823 --> 27:32.597
- What, you couldn't wait ?
- I didn't want him to get away.

27:33.021 --> 27:34.475
- You all right ?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.697
Say anything ? No.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.507
You should have stuck
to beating up girls.

27:40.521 --> 27:41.996
Bring him inside.

27:42.002 --> 27:43.247
Thank you.

27:47.702 --> 27:49.276
Does anybody watch this stuff ?

27:49.281 --> 27:51.508
We were never in this
room. We never saw them.

27:59.152 --> 28:00.635
It's Tiffany Spears.

28:04.871 --> 28:05.995
Where is she ?

28:16.413 --> 28:17.535
Help !

28:17.562 --> 28:19.356
Please, help !

28:20.512 --> 28:22.406
Help me !

28:23.960 --> 28:25.327
Help !

28:33.017 --> 28:35.653
If we're gonna get anything out
of Tony, we gotta praise him.

28:36.067 --> 28:38.523
He's the dominant. He
thinks he deserves it.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.624
Confirm instead of
undermine his expectations.

28:40.626 --> 28:43.121
Make him think he's smarter
than us because he saw it coming.

28:43.128 --> 28:44.653
We don't have much time.

28:50.649 --> 28:53.363
I know. I'm sorry. That's
just standard procedure.

28:54.009 --> 28:57.001
Special agent Aaron Hotchner.
I'm supervising this task force.

28:57.798 --> 29:00.674
<i>I just wanna say that
this case, your case, is...</i>

29:01.527 --> 29:02.853
<i>remarkable.</i>

29:02.886 --> 29:05.452
<i>You've got people at the
B.A.U. shaking their heads.</i>

29:06.069 --> 29:07.394
<i>What about you ?</i>

29:07.429 --> 29:08.621
<i>You shaking your head ?</i>

29:08.859 --> 29:10.544
Absolutely.

29:10.847 --> 29:13.654
Seven victims in three years. You've
got every woman in Jacksonville

29:13.668 --> 29:15.284
living in fear.

29:15.328 --> 29:17.234
That's pretty much what
you wanted, isn't it ?

29:17.999 --> 29:21.044
I'm sure whoever's responsible
for it is enjoying it.

29:21.316 --> 29:24.254
<i>The B.A.U. would like to study you,</i>

29:24.419 --> 29:26.934
<i>interview you, with your
permission, of course.</i>

29:26.946 --> 29:28.832
<i>Show me what's in the boxes.</i>

29:30.987 --> 29:33.324
This. They're all full.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.031
It's all you.

29:36.569 --> 29:37.951
We can...

29:38.677 --> 29:40.824
we can open all the boxes if you want.

29:42.697 --> 29:45.291
No. I wanna see my lawyer.

29:46.137 --> 29:48.562
Well, Tony sure lawyered up quick.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.464
<i>- He's playing games.
- Florida state wants to make a deal</i>

29:50.488 --> 29:51.902
<i>if you tell us where Tiffany Spears is.</i>

29:51.908 --> 29:54.973
This guy's been to jail before. He
knows how to keep his mouth shut.

29:57.307 --> 29:59.951
- What do you think, I'm stupid ?
- Far from it.

30:09.696 --> 30:11.094
Look at that.

30:11.098 --> 30:13.074
Notice how he's focused
on those two pictures.

30:13.108 --> 30:15.524
We can't forensically tie
him to those victims, but

30:15.556 --> 30:18.272
we're certain that he posed
those bodies after death.

30:18.319 --> 30:19.922
Well, that's certainly not working.

30:19.939 --> 30:22.513
- I'm not getting anywhere with him.
- Is the wife still here ?

30:22.596 --> 30:25.954
- We wanna put her in a room with him ?
- We need to humanize him.

30:27.328 --> 30:30.171
- I think she could do that.
- How ? He abuses her.

30:30.186 --> 30:31.574
And she takes it.

30:31.589 --> 30:33.261
She's subservient to him.

30:33.319 --> 30:34.892
You think she'd do it ?

30:34.918 --> 30:37.591
If we wanna find Tiffany
Spears, she'll have to.

30:39.698 --> 30:41.352
It's worth a shot.

30:43.568 --> 30:46.712
We'd been together two years,
so we were gonna start a family.

30:47.288 --> 30:48.681
Sorry to interrupt.

30:49.399 --> 30:51.352
Few minutes. Thank you.

30:57.459 --> 30:58.931
How are you holdin'up ?

30:59.687 --> 31:01.464
Okay, I guess.

31:05.477 --> 31:06.923
You called your family ?

31:08.206 --> 31:10.223
Tony's my only family.

31:14.379 --> 31:15.981
Tony won't talk to us.

31:18.366 --> 31:19.943
What are you gonna do ?

31:22.987 --> 31:25.402
I think if you go in
there, he'll talk to you.

31:29.006 --> 31:31.131
You want me to go in a room with him ?

31:34.478 --> 31:35.922
I can't do that.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.741
There- you gotta
find another way.

31:37.758 --> 31:40.021
He'll kill me. I turned him in.

31:42.698 --> 31:44.812
Look what he did to me.

31:45.218 --> 31:46.201
I know.

31:51.088 --> 31:52.492
I believe...

31:53.958 --> 31:56.761
that you're the only person
who can get through to Tony.

32:00.597 --> 32:03.733
With Joe dead, Tony's the only on
who knows where Tiffany Spears is.

32:04.399 --> 32:05.823
And if he tells you,

32:06.606 --> 32:08.122
you've saved her life.

32:11.576 --> 32:13.253
Right now, you're her only hope.

32:28.327 --> 32:30.792
Honey, I need to know where...

32:35.108 --> 32:36.713
where the girl is.

32:42.197 --> 32:43.454
Don't you mean...

32:44.408 --> 32:45.791
they need to know ?

32:52.279 --> 32:54.171
Why should I tell them anything ?

32:55.038 --> 32:56.531
What have I got to gain ?

32:58.398 --> 33:00.982
They're pinning us for
seven murders, Amber.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.354
I can't believe you and
Joey killed them all.

33:06.217 --> 33:07.574
Seven !

33:18.557 --> 33:21.283
None of this would have
happened if Joey had stayed away.

33:21.817 --> 33:23.914
We were on our way to better things.

33:24.739 --> 33:26.442
Joey messed that up for us.

33:32.417 --> 33:34.891
I need you to tell me, Tony.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.742
Where'd Joey take the girl ?

33:43.746 --> 33:45.022
I can't.

33:48.489 --> 33:50.731
I'm begging you to end this.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.143
Tell me now.

33:56.766 --> 33:58.431
Where's the girl ?

34:08.498 --> 34:10.011
There's this...

34:10.277 --> 34:11.822
storage unit.

34:14.916 --> 34:16.664
Joe's dad is the only one

34:16.958 --> 34:18.391
<i>who has the key.</i>

34:28.357 --> 34:31.011
I can't believe my husband
killed all those women.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.844
It took a lot of courage to go
in there. You did the right thing.

34:34.688 --> 34:36.771
Can we get you a glass
of water or something ?

34:38.398 --> 34:39.804
- Yeah.
- Water ?

34:39.817 --> 34:40.954
Yeah.

34:41.096 --> 34:42.543
You stay with her, please ?

34:42.547 --> 34:43.813
Yes, sir.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.521
Joe's dad ? Isn't he in
a wheelchair, though ?

34:48.696 --> 34:50.822
Only for the last 2 years.

34:50.967 --> 34:53.312
Henry Davin could have raped
and killed the first two women

34:53.328 --> 34:56.194
three years ago, then brought in
Joe and Tony to continue his work.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.882
Maybe it's the only
satisfaction he can get.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.614
Now they record it, and
he lives it though them.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.271
So it was a team of three.

35:01.288 --> 35:04.064
We found Laura Clemensen's hair
at Henry's house. It makes sense.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.811
Let's take a ride. Let's go.

35:09.176 --> 35:11.384
Tony Canardo's one sick bastard.

35:11.399 --> 35:13.814
I'm not surprised mother
abandoned him when he was 4,

35:13.817 --> 35:15.361
and then she got clean

35:15.376 --> 35:17.184
and got him back until he was 11,

35:17.196 --> 35:20.192
- when she got busted for prostitution.
- No wonder he hates women.

35:20.198 --> 35:22.851
He bounced around social
services after that.

35:22.866 --> 35:25.661
I mean, this guy never had
any support, no foundation,

35:25.917 --> 35:27.391
no security.

35:27.409 --> 35:30.182
How'd he get the confidence to
pull off something like that ?

35:30.598 --> 35:32.763
Maybe that's why he needed a partner.

35:32.778 --> 35:34.794
But he's supposed to
be the dominant one,

35:35.108 --> 35:36.261
the leader.

35:36.836 --> 35:38.551
And given his history...

35:39.327 --> 35:41.003
How can he do that ?

35:49.209 --> 35:51.641
She's not here. She was never here.

35:51.658 --> 35:53.641
What the hell's going on ?

35:55.699 --> 35:57.671
This looks nothing like the video.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.101
He's really playing a tough
guy with that officer, huh ?

36:04.798 --> 36:06.693
He played the tough guy with Hotch.

36:07.327 --> 36:09.891
It wasn't antagonistic.
It was defensive.

36:10.898 --> 36:12.162
False bravado ?

36:12.187 --> 36:15.214
- You think he's wearing a mask ?
- Let me see Amber's tape.

36:21.616 --> 36:23.244
Why isn't she scared ?

36:23.876 --> 36:25.322
She looks scared to me.

36:25.539 --> 36:27.762
No. Look.

36:29.038 --> 36:31.521
She initiated eye contact, right there.

36:33.939 --> 36:34.902
Yeah ?

36:34.969 --> 36:37.594
- You guys have gotta hear this.
- Patch it through.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.582
If she were afraid, she'd
look anywhere but his face.

36:42.257 --> 36:44.671
She's looking at the victims,
and she doesn't really...

36:44.676 --> 36:46.893
she doesn't seem that
repulsed. She actually...

36:46.917 --> 36:49.214
looks surprisingly calm.

36:50.049 --> 36:52.323
<i>Now put that little bitch on her side.</i>

36:52.337 --> 36:55.573
<i>You like it, don't you ?
Dirty whore likes it.</i>

36:55.837 --> 36:57.334
He's studying her.

36:57.656 --> 36:59.722
He's waiting for her lead.

36:59.726 --> 37:01.621
<i>Where'd Joey take the girl ?</i>

37:01.816 --> 37:04.833
- She just gave him an order.
- He's protecting her.

37:04.847 --> 37:07.023
He's giving her an out.

37:07.047 --> 37:09.511
<i>- Do it again.
- Where is she ?</i>

37:09.727 --> 37:11.792
Where's the girl ?! Where is she ?!

37:12.498 --> 37:13.922
Told you to watch her.

37:25.254 --> 37:27.761
We analyzed what we
recorded of Tony and Amber.

37:27.776 --> 37:29.369
Turns out she's the dominant one.

37:29.384 --> 37:31.779
Garcia finally isolated
the soundtrack on that DVD.

37:31.794 --> 37:33.480
<i>Turns out it was Amber
giving the orders.</i>

37:33.484 --> 37:36.151
That means she's the one doing
the killing. Where is Amber now ?

37:36.177 --> 37:38.950
She told the cop she was going out for
a smoke and walked out the back door.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.812
We're running out of time. You've gotta
find out where they're holding Tiffany.

37:42.136 --> 37:43.680
I'll change the approach.

37:45.734 --> 37:47.509
you're gonna wanna look at this.

37:49.037 --> 37:51.339
Joey Davin's DNA didn't
match the first 2 victims.

37:51.354 --> 37:52.749
That means neither could Henry's.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.989
So who raped the first two girls ?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.402
Lucky man, you know that ?

38:01.656 --> 38:03.541
You have something really special.

38:04.385 --> 38:06.972
I mean, she had to know what
you were doing to all those women

38:07.694 --> 38:09.469
and stayed with you anyway.

38:12.884 --> 38:15.482
Must feel great to be
appreciated by the woman you love.

38:16.884 --> 38:18.589
- It does.
- I bet.

38:19.686 --> 38:22.380
I know you and Amber would
do anything for each other.

38:22.456 --> 38:24.262
But why would you confess

38:24.804 --> 38:26.120
to killing

38:26.716 --> 38:29.370
these two women when you
had no idea who they are ?

38:29.456 --> 38:31.100
Joey and I killed all of'em.

38:31.124 --> 38:32.182
Really ?

38:32.816 --> 38:35.021
Well, whose DNA did
we find at the scene ?

38:35.735 --> 38:38.130
- What are you talking about ?
- Well, it's not yours. It's not Joe's.

38:38.146 --> 38:39.921
That poor guy probably
had no idea these cars

38:39.934 --> 38:41.760
belonged to the women you killed.

38:43.096 --> 38:44.650
Makes you wonder if

38:44.717 --> 38:47.701
you and Joe hadn't shared a cell
together, maybe he'd still be alive.

38:47.714 --> 38:48.712
You got the wrong idea.

38:48.724 --> 38:51.209
No, I think you've got
the wrong idea, Tony.

38:51.774 --> 38:54.499
Joe wasn't your partner. Tiffany
Spears isn't at the storage unit.

38:54.515 --> 38:56.200
You wanna know what else ?

38:56.297 --> 38:59.591
We can hear Amber's voice on the
videos telling you what to do.

39:00.345 --> 39:02.170
We know Amber's your partner.

39:03.446 --> 39:04.530
Come on.

39:05.437 --> 39:06.530
Why ?

39:09.506 --> 39:11.941
- Why you protecting her ?
- She's my wife.

39:14.287 --> 39:15.872
- It's more than that.
- Look,

39:16.425 --> 39:17.450
nothing

39:18.655 --> 39:20.502
would ever come between us...

39:20.706 --> 39:21.771
not you...

39:22.276 --> 39:24.349
not nothing. Besides

39:25.154 --> 39:27.271
<i>- Amber would never do anything to hurt me.
- Reid here.</i>

39:27.286 --> 39:30.749
No time for pleasantries. I was able to
unseal a file regarding Amber Canardo.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.179
- What does it say ?
- When Amber was 15,

39:33.197 --> 39:36.599
she walked into a Tallahassee hospital,
raped and beaten something awful.

39:36.616 --> 39:38.701
Doctors deduced she was
being abused by her father

39:38.716 --> 39:40.280
and her brother. Eventually

39:40.297 --> 39:42.591
they convinced her to go to
the police. But when she did,

39:42.607 --> 39:45.150
<i>mom showed up and told
them that Amber was lying.</i>

39:45.164 --> 39:47.669
She obviously did nothing to
protect Amber from the abuse.

39:48.407 --> 39:50.581
She feels betrayed by her mother and now

39:50.597 --> 39:52.392
receives extreme sadistic pleasure

39:52.406 --> 39:54.460
in watching the same
thing that happened to her.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.921
Strange. In this case
the abused actually

39:56.937 --> 39:59.252
<i>- became the abuser. That
doesn't happen a lot ?</i>

39:59.255 --> 40:00.362
1 in 8.

40:00.977 --> 40:02.302
We found the one.

40:05.014 --> 40:07.031
You ask Amber how the
first two women died ?

40:10.106 --> 40:11.900
She's done it before, Tony.

40:13.437 --> 40:15.532
- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has, with other men.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.099
You're not so special.

40:17.744 --> 40:19.740
Men mean nothing to her.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.529
She used you, just like the other guy.

40:23.545 --> 40:24.639
Shut up.

40:26.317 --> 40:29.161
She set you up, Tony.
She had you do everything.

40:32.085 --> 40:33.572
<i>Whose DNA</i>

40:34.347 --> 40:36.371
do you think that was at the scene ?

40:36.977 --> 40:38.770
Come on. Think about it.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.321
Amber beat herself up,

40:41.737 --> 40:44.720
she walked in here, she handed
me Laura Clemensen's ring,

40:44.724 --> 40:46.962
and she told us you
gave it to her as a gift.

40:46.965 --> 40:49.251
You know it's true, and
that's why you're upset.

40:49.266 --> 40:51.221
Gideon, Garcia found out

40:51.234 --> 40:54.051
<i>that Amber was abused by
her brother and her father.</i>

40:54.666 --> 40:56.602
<i>They'd take her to the woods.</i>

40:58.557 --> 40:59.980
She betrayed you, Tony.

41:02.277 --> 41:04.369
There's only one way to get
her back. Because if you don't,

41:04.385 --> 41:06.750
she'll forget about you,
just like this other guy.

41:08.556 --> 41:10.381
Tell us where she's keeping the girl.

41:13.617 --> 41:15.600
I know Amber's father
kept her in the woods

41:15.615 --> 41:17.621
so no one would hear her scream.

41:18.614 --> 41:21.532
Was it Amber's idea to leave
the girls in the woods ?

41:25.354 --> 41:27.061
Where's Tiffany ?

41:36.445 --> 41:38.060
There's a cabin.

42:16.976 --> 42:17.942
Go !

42:22.025 --> 42:23.220
FBI !

42:24.667 --> 42:25.890
Back off !

42:27.625 --> 42:29.759
- You got nothin'on me.
- Yeah, we just got your voice

42:29.774 --> 42:31.600
- on tape giving orders.
- So what ?

42:31.615 --> 42:33.322
He saved one little whore.

42:33.326 --> 42:35.230
Tiffany, I'm FBI. I'm
not gonna hurt you.

42:35.244 --> 42:37.440
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Believe me.

42:37.645 --> 42:39.969
She'll never be the same.

42:43.297 --> 42:45.249
You're okay. You're okay.

42:45.257 --> 42:46.400
We got Amber.

42:46.414 --> 42:48.511
<i>Tiffany Spears is alive.</i>

43:12.835 --> 43:14.719
All right. Thank you.

43:14.906 --> 43:16.479
Jacksonville P.D. found the remains

43:16.484 --> 43:18.212
of a body on the grounds of the cabin.

43:18.227 --> 43:20.769
They think it's Amber
Canardo's old boyfriend.

43:20.805 --> 43:23.881
And 10'll get you 20 that
DNA'll match the first 2 victims.

43:24.416 --> 43:27.032
At least the families
will finally have closure.

43:29.045 --> 43:31.030
And we did save Tiffany Spears.

43:34.614 --> 43:36.812
