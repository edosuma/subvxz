<i> He doesn't respond the way</i>
<i> he used to.</i>

07:58.730 --> 08:01.500
<i> I have to kind of chase him</i>
<i> for attention.</i>

08:01.500 --> 08:05.930
My biggest fear is that J
is with someone.

08:05.940 --> 08:07.670
I don't want to be
the other woman.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.440
My husband cheated on me.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.170
I don't want to do that
to anyone.

08:12.180 --> 08:14.140
So I can't.

08:14.140 --> 08:17.780
I can't be with him
if he's with someone else,

08:17.780 --> 08:22.980
so I really want to make sure
that I love who I think I love.

08:22.990 --> 08:24.720
- Can we see some of
the messages

08:24.720 --> 08:26.550
you guys send to each other?

08:26.560 --> 08:30.260
Wow, look at this.
Look at this screen.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.590
- Jeez.
- Oh, my God.

08:31.590 --> 08:33.360
- I kind of love it, though.
- How do I--

08:33.360 --> 08:35.460
- You just scroll down.
- That's the way it should be.

08:35.470 --> 08:38.070
- I just can't believe you've
had this entire relationship

08:38.070 --> 08:40.000
without emojis.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.169
- I'm so far behind with it.

08:42.169 --> 08:45.740
- You said, "Hey, boy,
I missed you."

08:45.740 --> 08:48.240
He said, "I'm sorry.
I've been a little busy.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.180
Hopefully I can make it up
to you somehow,"

08:50.180 --> 08:52.350
and you said, "How do you plan
on making it up to me?"

08:52.350 --> 08:55.250
and then he said, "Oh, hopefully
you'll see soon enough."

08:55.250 --> 08:56.850
A little flirty.
- Yeah.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.820
- If he were dating
someone else,

08:58.820 --> 09:00.120
it'd be messed-up of him

09:00.120 --> 09:02.020
to continue talking
to you in this way.

09:02.030 --> 09:02.920
- Yeah.

09:02.930 --> 09:04.890
I want who I fell in love with,

09:04.890 --> 09:07.530
and I'm really hoping that
that's what I get.

09:07.530 --> 09:09.030
- You're just tired
of Jack [bleep].

09:09.030 --> 09:10.900
- [laughs]

09:10.900 --> 09:14.600
- All right, well, we have our
job cut out for us for sure.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.870
Let's get out of here.

09:15.870 --> 09:18.210
- See you later.
- So long, Shawny.

09:20.110 --> 09:21.940
- Whoever this is
could know her.

09:21.950 --> 09:22.980
- Right.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.750
- It's an inside job.
- Right.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.780
Why wouldn't they have met up?
Why would he be so mysterious?

09:26.780 --> 09:28.320
Why wouldn't he talk
on the phone?

09:28.320 --> 09:31.950
- If he turns out to not be
who he says he is,

09:31.960 --> 09:34.560
<i> it's gonna really mess her up.</i>

09:35.930 --> 09:37.790
- Today will be interesting.

09:37.790 --> 09:40.600
I mean, we have almost nothing
to go on here.

09:40.600 --> 09:46.670
So essentially, it has to be
someone she knows.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.170
Otherwise,

09:49.170 --> 09:50.870
how would
they have found her?

09:50.870 --> 09:54.280
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

09:54.280 --> 09:56.940
Okay, we're gonna make
a big splash now.

09:56.950 --> 09:58.350
- Splashy.
- Here we go.

09:58.350 --> 10:04.350
- Oh, boy. Oh!
- Let's crack this case.

10:06.220 --> 10:10.490
Hello. Wow, this place is cool.
- Wow.

10:10.490 --> 10:11.830
- All right.
- Okay.

10:11.830 --> 10:12.830
- For this investigation,

10:12.830 --> 10:14.130
we need to go old-school.

10:14.130 --> 10:15.730
- She doesn't
use technology, so--

10:15.730 --> 10:18.030
- We got to run--we got
to run the numbers on this one.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.170
What's the phone number?

10:20.170 --> 10:21.240
What do we got, anything?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.570
Any hits?

10:22.570 --> 10:26.040
No, we're not getting
any hits, Max.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.740
I don't know what else to do.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.010
All right.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.780
<i> We've got</i>
<i> an interesting story here.</i>

10:30.780 --> 10:33.010
Shawny's been married,
had ups and downs.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.380
He's cheated on her a lot.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.420
They finally agreed
to get a divorce.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.750
<i> Along comes Jack.</i>

10:38.760 --> 10:40.550
Problem is, they both
live in Rochester.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.720
They haven't met;
can't even talk on the phone.

10:42.730 --> 10:47.460
Her big concern is that Jack
is in another relationship,

10:47.460 --> 10:48.660
so first thing we need to do,

10:48.670 --> 10:50.460
see if we can figure out
who Jack is.

10:50.470 --> 10:52.670
Second and maybe as important,

10:52.670 --> 10:56.200
is Jack in a relationship
with someone else?

10:56.210 --> 10:58.170
All right,
we got some photos,

10:58.170 --> 10:59.370
so we can search.
Are you ready?

10:59.380 --> 11:00.840
- Yup.
- Here it is.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.550
- Here we go.
- I don't think this is a hit.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.050
- No.
- Number two.

11:06.050 --> 11:07.480
- Nope.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.620
- Come on, dude.
- All right, last one.

11:09.620 --> 11:10.380
Nope.

11:10.390 --> 11:11.690
- No luck on the pictures.

11:11.690 --> 11:15.120
- So all we have
is his phone number.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.490
I think we got to run it.

11:16.490 --> 11:19.730
- This better give us something.

11:19.730 --> 11:20.960
No name.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.600
Is that an address
of where it's located?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.600
- Is it the house
on the right or the left?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.000
Let's zoom in here.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.500
- Enhance. Enhance.
- And enhance. Okay.

11:29.510 --> 11:31.370
- Oh, 28.
- 28.

11:31.370 --> 11:33.570
- What's the number
on this house?

11:33.580 --> 11:34.810
- 22.

11:34.810 --> 11:38.110
Okay, let's look--
let's look those up.

11:38.110 --> 11:41.180
Rochester, NY.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.820
Wait a second.

11:42.820 --> 11:44.990
Robert [bleep], 92?

11:44.990 --> 11:46.290
Remember, she has that old guy

11:46.290 --> 11:47.720
who used to call her
all the time?

11:47.720 --> 11:48.690
- That's true.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.490
- Well, maybe it's the same guy,

11:50.490 --> 11:51.960
and he figured out how to text.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.830
- This is one technologically
advanced old man.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.900
- All right, let's see
the other house.

11:58.900 --> 11:59.870
- All right.

11:59.870 --> 12:02.470
- Angel, a woman in her
early 30s.

12:02.470 --> 12:05.540
- All right, well.
- Let's look that name up.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.340
Oh, Angel in Rochester.

12:07.340 --> 12:10.410
- Oh, we got one?
Oh, in Rochester. Whoa.

12:10.410 --> 12:14.150
- Hey.
Studied medical assisting.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.450
- All right, we got a nurse.

12:15.450 --> 12:17.620
- Lives in Rochester.
Here she is.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.520
- Mm-hmm.
- With a gay pride flag.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.620
- It seems like she could
be into women.

12:22.630 --> 12:24.060
- Right.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.430
- Which would point to her.
- Maybe Shawny knows Angel.

12:26.430 --> 12:29.730
- She does look clean,
which means she uses soap.

12:29.730 --> 12:31.670
[laughter]

12:31.670 --> 12:33.770
- This is
a very possible suspect.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.640
We have to assume if they're
not talking on the phone,

12:35.640 --> 12:38.570
it's because they're not
the gender they say they are.

12:38.570 --> 12:41.640
The phone number
is linked to that house.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.680
That house is linked
to this woman.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.010
It would make sense why they
haven't spoken on the phone.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.650
- This woman could be linked.
- This woman is of

12:47.650 --> 12:48.980
the right sort of age

12:48.990 --> 12:51.920
and potentially
sexual orientation.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.090
We should message Angel.

12:53.090 --> 12:54.290
"Strange as it may seem,

12:54.290 --> 12:55.390
we are making
an episode of our TV show,

12:55.390 --> 12:57.060
"Catfish,"
and your name came up.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.130
We'd love to speak with you
and ask you a couple questions.

12:59.130 --> 13:00.800
Please get back to me ASAP.
Thanks."

13:00.800 --> 13:01.700
- Time out.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.730
My antennae are vibrating.

13:04.730 --> 13:08.640
I think that we might be
getting duped.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.770
I'm officially suspicious.

13:10.770 --> 13:14.280
I think that Shawny
might know who this is.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.910
- Okay.
- She might know this is Angel.

13:15.910 --> 13:20.610
She was very, very open
to it being a woman.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.920
You know what I mean?
Like, I--

13:21.920 --> 13:24.020
- Is this a setup?
- Could be a setup.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.990
- For what, though?
- There have been people

13:25.990 --> 13:27.390
who've come on the show,

13:27.390 --> 13:31.690
but then it turned out that they
knew the catfish all along.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.890
You lied to the show
so that you could come on

13:33.900 --> 13:36.300
and then meet each
other in person?

13:36.300 --> 13:37.600
- Yeah.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.900
- I generally am not one

13:38.900 --> 13:40.270
for conspiracy theories,

13:40.270 --> 13:42.200
but I've got a gut feeling
about this.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.300
- All right.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.640
- And I'm--want to grill her.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.780
- Great, so you can give her
the third degree,

13:48.780 --> 13:50.480
and maybe she'll
tell us something,

13:50.480 --> 13:53.310
or maybe she'll know something
about one of these people.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.080
- I'm telling you, man,
something is up.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.550
- At this point
anything's possible.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.990
- Maybe before we
share it all with her,

14:02.990 --> 14:05.090
we should kind of apply
a little pressure

14:05.090 --> 14:06.460
and see what she does.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.360
- All right, yeah.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.160
I'll let you work--play bad cop.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.630
- All right.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.000
- Get your game face on.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.070
[knocks]

14:15.070 --> 14:16.400
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

14:16.410 --> 14:17.440
- Hey.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.610
- What's up?

14:19.610 --> 14:20.910
- [sighs]

14:20.910 --> 14:24.510
- Okay, Shawny, we need
to have a real talk here.

14:24.510 --> 14:25.550
- Yes.

14:25.550 --> 14:27.210
- You've seen the show.
- Mm-hmm.

14:27.220 --> 14:30.020
- There have been people
who've come on the show

14:30.020 --> 14:34.320
who claim to have
never met the person

14:34.320 --> 14:35.860
that they ended up
talking to.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.190
- Okay.

14:37.190 --> 14:38.960
- But then
it turned out

14:38.960 --> 14:40.930
that they knew them
all along.

14:40.930 --> 14:42.330
- Okay.

14:42.330 --> 14:45.370
- Because this person
is in Rochester--

14:45.370 --> 14:51.270
- The story feels
very--it's unusual.

14:51.270 --> 14:53.110
- So I just want to
give you

14:53.110 --> 14:54.440
an opportunity now...

14:54.440 --> 14:55.510
- Uh-huh.

14:55.510 --> 14:59.910
- To let us know
if by any chance you know

14:59.920 --> 15:04.850
who this person already
is that you're talking to.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.390
- I wish I did.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.160
That's why I called you guys.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.520
I put myself out there
to do this.

15:10.530 --> 15:14.190
Coming on TV is gonna embarrass
the hell out of me,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.830
and I'm really
gonna be pissed off

15:15.830 --> 15:17.500
if it's not the situation

15:17.500 --> 15:21.240
that I've thought that I've had
for the last five months.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.300
I'm not, you know,
one of those type of people

15:23.310 --> 15:26.610
to even put myself
out there like that,

15:26.610 --> 15:29.880
so this is kind of huge.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.980
- Okay.
Real talk over.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.680
- Max is very suspicious.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.820
We've been duped before.
That's why.

15:35.820 --> 15:36.880
- Yeah.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.150
- All right, so let me show

15:38.150 --> 15:39.420
you what we found.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.890
We looked up his phone number.
- Okay.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.120
- This is interesting
because even though it

15:43.130 --> 15:44.790
doesn't know
who the phone number

15:44.790 --> 15:49.000
is registered to,
it has a little pin on a map.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.430
- Yeah.
- So when we zoom in,

15:50.430 --> 15:53.430
it's actually pointing
at two houses.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.500
- Uh-huh.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.100
- And so you can see
this is number 22.

15:57.110 --> 16:00.140
- Okay.
- And this house is number 28.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.740
- Okay.
- So then we thought, "Okay,

16:01.740 --> 16:04.350
let's look up these houses
and see who lives there."

16:04.350 --> 16:05.380
- Yeah.

16:05.380 --> 16:06.910
- 28 was the first
one on the left.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.080
It looks like Robert [bleep]

16:09.090 --> 16:11.450
owns it or lives
there presently.

16:11.450 --> 16:12.990
- Okay.
- Do you know the name of

16:12.990 --> 16:14.860
the old man
who used to call you?

16:14.860 --> 16:18.960
- I think he said his name was,
like, George or something.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.590
- H--any idea how old he was or?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.730
- No, he just
sounded really old.

16:22.730 --> 16:23.760
- Like, really old?

16:23.770 --> 16:27.330
- Like, at least
grandpa times two old.

16:27.340 --> 16:28.970
- Robert [bleep] is 92.

16:28.970 --> 16:30.240
- Grandfather times two.
- Yeah.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.440
- You used to get

this woman before?

17:18.150 --> 17:21.220

a number of references

17:23.329 --> 17:26.589

17:26.599 --> 17:29.160

17:29.170 --> 17:30.430

on the phone.

medical assisting.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.970

34:16.320 --> 34:18.659
<i> Do you think you'd be</i>
<i> interested in sitting down</i>

34:18.659 --> 34:20.420
<i> to kind of talk about all this?</i>

34:22.130 --> 34:24.730
<i> - We'll come over.</i>
<i> We'll invite Brandon over,</i>

34:24.730 --> 34:27.600
<i> and we'll all wrap this up.</i>

34:27.600 --> 34:28.830
<i> - All right.</i>

34:34.909 --> 34:38.679
- Oh, just head right in.
- All right. Hey.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.739
- Hey.
- What's up? How you doing?

34:41.750 --> 34:43.880
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.750
- How are you?
- How you doing?

34:45.750 --> 34:46.650
- Good.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.550
[knock at door]
- Oh.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.889
- Hey.
- Hello.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.659
- Come in.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.429
- Hey, man.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.500
- Yo. What's up?
- How you doing?

34:58.500 --> 35:00.130
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.130
- So how you feeling?

35:03.130 --> 35:05.440
- I'm feeling all right.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.370
Yesterday I didn't want
to admit it,

35:08.370 --> 35:10.040
but I was pretty upset.

35:10.040 --> 35:14.280
I didn't expect Ebony
to be Shawny,

35:14.280 --> 35:20.750
and I definitely wanted to say
some things to make her

35:20.750 --> 35:22.990
just as upset as I was.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.520
Like, this wasn't something,
like, that was,

35:26.530 --> 35:31.630
like, uh...

35:31.630 --> 35:33.460
I didn't really grow up

35:33.470 --> 35:36.000
expressing myself talking, so.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.870
- This is a difficult
conversation for anybody

35:40.870 --> 35:44.240
to have with a girlfriend

35:44.240 --> 35:47.940
of six months
or partner of 16 years.

35:47.950 --> 35:50.750
I mean, this is
a tough conversation.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.650
- I'm not mad at you
about anything.

35:56.660 --> 35:59.960
I'm not holding anything
against you.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.860
I always loved you
ever since we was little.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.960
- I always loved you too.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.800
- I shouldn't have had
to do this.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.200
And I see now, like,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.700
I was trying to hold on
to something

36:11.700 --> 36:13.240
I knew wasn't there,

36:13.240 --> 36:16.170
but for some reason
I thought I was gonna fix it.

36:16.170 --> 36:19.140
I know I didn't really
think it all through

36:19.140 --> 36:20.410
like I should have,

36:20.410 --> 36:22.610
and I'm sorry.

36:24.780 --> 36:26.250
- I accept your apology.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.820
I'm definitely sorry
for a lot of stuff.

36:29.820 --> 36:33.290
There's been too much,
too many years, so.

36:37.260 --> 36:41.130
- I don't think that
it would be

36:41.130 --> 36:46.640
the most healthiest thing
to keep doing this.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.180
- You always been
a good friend to me,

36:52.180 --> 36:57.510
and you ended up
being two friends to me,

36:57.520 --> 37:00.780
and I definitely
appreciate that.

37:00.790 --> 37:03.890
Honestly, I probably
caused all this.

37:03.890 --> 37:08.190
I have a lot of regrets,

37:08.190 --> 37:12.900
and I definitely got to think
about working on myself.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.300
- I think we should have
did this before.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.900
It would have been
so much easier,

37:17.900 --> 37:21.300
but maybe it just needed
to be like this.

37:21.310 --> 37:23.110
I'm so sorry.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.170
Thanks.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.710
This is what we needed.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.810
- Glad we could help.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.450
Sounds like you're all
on the same page

37:32.450 --> 37:34.320
with what you want right now.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.390
- Yeah.
- Yes.

37:35.390 --> 37:37.790
- You got plenty of things
to worry about,

37:37.790 --> 37:40.660
but hopefully being able
to call each other

37:40.660 --> 37:42.690
and talk isn't one of them.

37:42.690 --> 37:45.360
- No.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.000
- All right, guess
that's it for us.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.270
- Yes. All right, thank you.
- Give me a hug.

37:50.270 --> 37:53.470
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.700
- Yeah, dude.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.340
- Thank you.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.210
- Thank you.
- [laughs]

38:02.210 --> 38:03.410
Thank you, guys.

38:03.420 --> 38:04.750
- All right, so we'll
get out of your way.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.220
- Okay.

38:06.220 --> 38:07.480
- Have a good weekend
with your--with your kids.

38:07.490 --> 38:08.480
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

38:08.490 --> 38:09.650
- Bye.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.220
<i> [melancholy music]</i>

38:11.220 --> 38:14.090
<i> [line trilling]</i>

38:14.090 --> 38:15.860
both: Hey!

38:15.860 --> 38:17.730
- How are you?
- Good, how are you guys?

38:17.730 --> 38:20.700
- Look at that hair. Is
that--That's a new 'do, huh?

38:20.700 --> 38:21.700
- Yes.
- It looks great.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.230
- Thank you.

38:23.230 --> 38:25.700
- So tell us, how has everything
been since we saw you?

38:25.700 --> 38:29.110
- Everything has been awesome.
- Awesome.

38:29.110 --> 38:31.110
- I think it has a lot to do
with "Catfish."

38:31.110 --> 38:34.840
Brandon and I figured out a way
that we could be together

38:34.850 --> 38:37.150
and do stuff with the kids.
- Hi.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.380
- Hi, Dad.

38:38.380 --> 38:42.520
- So you and Brandon are still
separated?

38:42.520 --> 38:43.820
- Yeah, we're not together.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.490
- But you're spending time
together

38:45.490 --> 38:47.990
and he's more involved
with the kids now?

38:47.990 --> 38:51.060
<i> - Yes, he spends a lot more</i>
<i> time with the kids now.</i>

38:51.060 --> 38:53.930
- Oh.
- [laughs] Whoa.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.800
- He even takes them out
and plans.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.500
It's like a whole different
thing.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.340
- Dad!
- Ah!

38:59.340 --> 39:01.300
- [giggling, squealing]

39:01.310 --> 39:04.410
<i> - Brandon and the kids have</i>
<i> a closer relationship now.</i>

39:04.410 --> 39:06.940
They're happy to be able to
spend more time with him.

39:06.950 --> 39:08.810
<i> Everything's completely</i>
<i> changed.</i>

39:08.810 --> 39:10.480
Thank you.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.420
Did you want any eggs?
- Eh--no, thank you.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.220
- Are you happy you did the
show?

39:16.220 --> 39:17.420
- Hell, yeah.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.290
- That's a strong answer.
- Wow.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.390
- The experience helped us get
things off of our chest

39:22.390 --> 39:24.230
that we were, like,
just holding in.

39:24.230 --> 39:27.800
<i> Kind of cleared the air for us</i>
<i> to just be normal now.</i>

39:27.800 --> 39:30.330
- I hungry.
I hungry.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.100
- So if you guys are
on good terms,

39:32.100 --> 39:35.000
do you mind if we add him
into this conversation?

39:35.010 --> 39:37.770
- Actually, he's here.
Brandon.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.510
<i> - Hey-o!</i>
<i> - Hey!</i>

39:39.510 --> 39:42.310
- It's really nice to see you
guys sitting with each other,

39:42.310 --> 39:44.280
<i> smiling and laughing.</i>
<i> This is great.</i>

39:44.280 --> 39:47.680
- Brandon, how have things been
for you since the episode ended?

39:47.690 --> 39:50.650
- I've been focusing on,
you know, putting more time

39:50.660 --> 39:52.520
in at work,
cooking and everything.

39:52.520 --> 39:56.430
I improved a burger,
a way to keep it juicy.

39:56.430 --> 39:59.530
<i> I think you will love it, but I</i>
<i> can't tell you how to do it.</i>

39:59.530 --> 40:02.060
I definitely can't tell you how.
It's my secret.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.230
Order up.
[bell dings]

40:04.240 --> 40:05.940
Been spending more time
with the family,

40:05.940 --> 40:07.770
getting along with Ebony.
[chuckles]

40:07.770 --> 40:10.440
- And do you miss Shawny?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.810
[both laughing]

40:13.680 --> 40:15.510
- That's true.
- [laughs]

40:15.510 --> 40:17.010
[both laugh]

40:17.020 --> 40:18.880
- Well, it sounds like you guys
are both doing well;

40:18.880 --> 40:20.780
the kids are happy;
you're happy.

40:20.790 --> 40:23.450
I can't believe this weird,
twisted

40:23.450 --> 40:29.030
situation untangled itself
into a beautiful bow.

40:29.030 --> 40:30.890
And I assume if you guys are
both in the same place,

40:30.900 --> 40:32.400
that means your kids are there
too, right?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.800
- Yeah.
- Can we say--

40:33.800 --> 40:35.230
- Wanna see?
- Yeah, I wanna say hi.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.230
- You guys wanna meet Max and
Nev?

40:37.240 --> 40:38.770
All right.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.100
- Hey.
- Oh, my goodness.

40:41.110 --> 40:42.340
- Look at all these kids.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.940
- I got a question for the kids
here.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.640
Does your dad make a good
burger?

40:46.640 --> 40:47.880
Thumbs up, or thumbs down?

40:47.880 --> 40:49.410
- Thumbs up.

40:49.410 --> 40:51.510
- Brandon, you can't give
yourself a thumbs up.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.880
[laughter]

40:52.880 --> 40:54.320
- All right, guys.
Have a great weekend.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.320
all: Thank you! Bye!
- Bye, guys.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.060
- So there's somebody
going around here

41:02.060 --> 41:03.230
terrorizing people
from Saginaw.

41:03.230 --> 41:05.430
- Saginaw catfish.
- This is crazy.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.660
<i> - We still don't really know</i>
<i> what we're dealing with.</i>

41:07.670 --> 41:09.930
- Oh, yeah, this is
a sticky situation right here.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.430
- Who is this person?

41:11.440 --> 41:12.640
- I think that's who
we're looking for.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.340
- This is really sketchy.

41:14.340 --> 41:17.710
- The deeper we dig,
the darker it gets.

41:17.710 --> 41:19.010
- Oh, my God.
