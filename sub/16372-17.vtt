00:06.080 --> 00:08.117
Is she in there?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.991
I don't see her.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.750
No, baby.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.790
That's just a skin sack full of bones.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.552
Why didn't she take her body?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.599
On account of all the pain and sorrow
it soaked up.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.596
What happens in life writes a story
in our flesh.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.197
What's gonna happen to her body?

00:30.360 --> 00:33.478
When we're done here,
they'll take this box and bury it deep.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.555
Can I go with?

00:35.760 --> 00:36.750
No, baby.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.232
Now, dry your eyes and
say your piece to your mother.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.597
Goodbye, Mama.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.114
There's been a complication.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.755
<i>- Anything serious?
- I'll fill you in when I get back.</i>

01:31.960 --> 01:35.032
I'm cutting this trip short.
I just have one more...

01:37.080 --> 01:38.514
One more stop to make.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.677
<i>- Migraines again?
- I'll be all right.</i>

02:26.200 --> 02:27.554
Kathryn Nemec.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.552
Your references are outstanding.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.758
Fluent in Italian,
French, German and Russian.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.034
Most of your charges appear to have
been in various diplomatic corps.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.072
I enjoy travel.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.916
You attended medical school
at Northwestern, yet you decided...

02:43.120 --> 02:44.713
...not to continue. May I ask why?

02:44.880 --> 02:47.156
Human anatomy was my Waterloo.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.310
The cadavers...

02:48.560 --> 02:50.233
Yes. Gruesome.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.678
No. I found them compelling.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.912
Much more interesting
than our living patients.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.312
I decided it would be healthier
to reorient my efforts...

03:00.480 --> 03:03.154
...from the end of life to its beginning.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.711
Thus a master's degree
in Child Development.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.630
There's no vocation more critical
than raising a child.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.111
It's my belief one can't be overqualified.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.875
This job will not be
without its challenges.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.954
I've no interest
in abdicating my role as a mother.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.231
While I am in this house...

03:22.400 --> 03:25.632
...I will be responsible
for tending to Masha's needs.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.640
You and Masha will join me
whenever you can.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.397
There will be times
I need to be unencumbered.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.634
So my primary duty will be
to care for the child...

03:36.800 --> 03:39.474
- When I'm gone. Yes.
- And while you're here?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.114
You will have one job...

03:50.320 --> 03:53.233
...and that is to discreetly
observe our interactions.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.750
During my absences...

03:56.000 --> 03:59.198
...I will expect you
to provide a continuity of care.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.190
The way I dress her, hold her,
change her, bathe her.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.230
You will be what I am to her.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.873
With one exception.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.715
Yes?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.797
You will not love her.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.791
You are safe.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.270
You are loved.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.000
You are wise.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.551
How many children have you raised?

04:37.720 --> 04:42.920
I've seen seven children
through their elementary years.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.118
Some of them siblings, of course.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.552
What do you feel toward them now?

04:47.800 --> 04:50.360
Pride, mostly.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.359
You want to know if I love them?

04:52.880 --> 04:55.111
They were never mine to love.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.875
But I would have died
for each and every one of them.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.717
What must a child do
to earn this eternal devotion of yours?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.559
Not much.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.355
Take Masha, for instance.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.876
We have a pact, she and I.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.438
Every time she takes a bottle from me
or falls asleep in my arms...

05:13.640 --> 05:19.159
...she's telling me
that she trusts me completely.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.514
That is a profound gift.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.032
I would do anything to protect your baby.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.149
<i>The forecast,
windy and cold this morning...</i>

05:30.320 --> 05:33.996
<i>...warming up this afternoon with a few
sunny breaks and diminishing winds.</i>

05:34.200 --> 05:36.351
<i>Today's high here is 33 degrees.</i>

05:36.600 --> 05:40.640
<i>Clear tonight with the temperature
dropping to a cold 19. Sunshine though...</i>

05:48.440 --> 05:51.512
I have a reservation for Room 8.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.430
There you go.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.594
I reserved Room 8.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.152
The young couple in there
extended their stay. What can you do?

06:05.880 --> 06:08.600
Is the adjacent room empty?

06:22.680 --> 06:27.277
For God's sake, what in the hell
are you crying about? Stop crying!

06:27.480 --> 06:28.516
Stop yelling at me.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.960
I cannot have these girl episodes
with the nagging and the crying!

07:37.080 --> 07:38.116
Are you hurt?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.794
I'm fine.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.475
Alexander will be home soon.
He can't see this.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.239
Go upstairs.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.635
Take a shower.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.314
While you do what?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.351
Clean the mess.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.756
Go.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.952
- All the time you're...
- Stop, all right?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.998
I don't know when I'll be back.
How's never?

08:27.160 --> 08:28.674
Jason...!

08:39.919 --> 08:41.433
You gotta be...

08:41.600 --> 08:43.432
Yo. Come on!

08:43.640 --> 08:45.996
I just want to buy some cigarettes!

08:46.160 --> 08:47.355
Come on!

08:47.520 --> 08:49.830
I have a pack in my trailer.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.760
Okay.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.991
Sure, lady. Thanks.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.112
Sweet ride.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.236
Good morning.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.797
Any problems?

09:14.360 --> 09:17.239
I considered killing you last night.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.230
Why didn't you?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.516
What you saw...

09:21.280 --> 09:24.956
It's more than Alexander
or anyone knows about me.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.357
Except the people I work for.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.517
Soviet intelligence?

09:30.120 --> 09:32.510
- There were documents on the man...
- Where's the body?

09:32.680 --> 09:33.750
In the woods.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.998
- Kate, there are specific ways...
- I sealed him in plastic wrap...

09:37.200 --> 09:41.717
...after I exsanguinated the corpse in the
tulip garden to speed the rate of decay.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.837
I buried the rest below the frost line...

09:44.040 --> 09:48.034
...so that the grave won't heave open
during the freeze and thaw cycles.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.673
I never expected
to have this conversation with you.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.080
What you saw last night...

09:56.280 --> 09:58.078
...you might see other things too.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.990
I told you I have a pact
with your daughter.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.713
I will do everything in my power
to keep her safe.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.952
And her mother.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.435
Have you seen my boyfriend?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.317
He went for smokes.
He didn't come back.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.994
Maybe he ran out on you.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.236
No, he left his car.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.671
- Did he leave his keys?
- Yes.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.069
Maybe he left them for you.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.000
No. He's a total dick.
He would never leave me his car.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.390
Oh, Christ, what the hell is he up to?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.119
Now I gotta go find him.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.551
You do that, deary.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.037
Do you want to ask me something, Kate?

11:41.560 --> 11:42.755
It's none of my business.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.480
I'm sorry to put you
in that uncomfortable position...

11:45.680 --> 11:47.911
...especially with Masha.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.111
- Is he American?
- He's...

11:51.920 --> 11:54.674
...an assignment. Was an assignment.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.036
I don't know what he is, he's...

11:57.960 --> 11:58.996
...married.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.510
- Is it serious?
- Yes.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.272
It's frivolous...

12:06.240 --> 12:08.197
...exciting...

12:08.360 --> 12:10.272
...dangerous.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.160
Do you love him?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.160
I don't know about love, Kate.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.756
In my job...

12:19.560 --> 12:22.394
The only one I know I love is Masha.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.032
Then you should end it
with the American.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.154
Thank you.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.954
Miss? Excuse me.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.354
What happened?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.880
Masha was abducted.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.514
What?

13:19.720 --> 13:22.519
A man was seen carrying her
off the campus. A blond man.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.756
The American?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.036
I started pulling away.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.237
We couldn't continue the way we were.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.470
He didn't take it well.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.760
So, what, he stole Masha to hurt you?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.200
No. That's not it.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.396
He thinks she's his.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.996
Is she?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.395
I don't know, Kate.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.789
I never found out.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.433
I didn't want to. It didn't matter.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.871
I was never gonna end up
with Raymond.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.077
Did you give the police his name?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.276
Never.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.591
It'd put Masha in danger.
Even more danger.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.879
I know where he's taking her.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.999
Home to America.
I'm gonna have to find her on my own.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.117
Not on your own.

15:09.320 --> 15:16.159
<i>Firefighters gather to battle a three-alarm
blaze at a residence downtown.</i>

15:16.320 --> 15:20.872
<i>The cause is unknown at this time. We'll
keep you updated as the story unfolds.</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:24.556
Oh, my God.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.831
Are you okay? Are you two okay?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.393
There was a fire.

15:29.880 --> 15:34.033
Too many people.
There was shouting and fighting.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.438
And Masha...

15:37.280 --> 15:38.430
What?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.073
Listen carefully.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.674
You stay here with Masha.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.996
Speak to no one.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.357
Do not answer the door or the telephone.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.075
Don't go out unless
you absolutely have to.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.839
- You're hurt...
- Listen.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.434
When it's safe, I'll
call with instructions.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.672
I'll ring once, hang up and call back.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.793
- Understand?
- You'll ring once, call back.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.516
Be good, little one.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.840
It wasn't your fault.
He was a bad man.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.640
I love you.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.196
Lock the door behind me.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.118
Do you have any fours?

16:49.120 --> 16:50.600
In English, please.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.029
Go fish.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.160
I asked you if you had kings
and you said no.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.472
You little sneak.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.994
Do you love me, Nyanya?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.800
Yes.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.229
I miss Mama.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.153
Me too.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.877
She is working very hard
to find us a new place to live.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.118
And then we'll all be together again.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.230
Where are you?

17:39.440 --> 17:40.635
I don't know. A pay phone.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.632
You need to come back
for your daughter.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.029
It's been over a week.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.230
I can't.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.199
The KGB uncovered my affair
with Raymond...

17:48.360 --> 17:50.750
...which means U.S. intelligence knows
as well.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.633
<i>Both sides are tracking me down.</i>

17:53.600 --> 17:55.319
I have to leave the country.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.477
<i>It'll be weeks
before I can come for Masha.</i>

17:57.680 --> 17:59.751
Masha can't stay in a motel that long.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.195
She needs a home.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.232
<i>I can take her to my sister in Chicago.</i>

18:03.400 --> 18:06.791
No. You're the family nanny,
you're a person of interest.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.440
They'll track you.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.514
You have to leave Masha with
someone unconnected who I can trust.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.798
I want you to get in touch
with Sam Milhoan.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.394
He's listed.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.676
Kearney, Nebraska.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.753
Leave Masha?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.917
You must.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.595
I'm sorry you had to drive all this way...

18:33.800 --> 18:35.678
...but I'm in no position to help here.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.872
- I told Kat...
- Katarina called you?

18:38.040 --> 18:40.680
Sure did. And she sent you anyway.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.476
She told me that you are the only person
who knew both her and Raymond...

18:44.680 --> 18:46.000
...the only one they trusted.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.554
Yeah, well, that may be...

18:47.720 --> 18:51.157
Of all the people in the world,
she chose you to protect her daughter...

18:51.320 --> 18:55.872
All right, all right, stop. Did Kat happen
to mention that I'm a grifter?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.475
I scam people out
of their hard-earned cash.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.036
Now, I'm trying to go straight here.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.920
But I don't have room in my life
for a kid.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.591
I'm not able to be with Masha.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.991
I would just put her life at risk.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.391
You're not gonna stay with me?

19:11.600 --> 19:14.911
You said when we found a place
to live we would all be together.

19:18.840 --> 19:23.039
I want that more
than anything in the world.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.552
It just can't be now.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.717
You promised.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.475
Oh, crap.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.029
Cargo.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.272
Hi.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.594
Hey. Hey.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.876
A kid needs her mother.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.590
But until the heat's off...

19:50.560 --> 19:52.517
...she's got me.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.430
Katarina?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.393
Kate. I'm so sorry.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.153
<i>I'm going crazy in this place.</i>

20:29.320 --> 20:30.390
I know.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.430
So when are you coming back
for Masha?

20:35.280 --> 20:37.033
I can't.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.269
I'm going away.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.320
What?

20:41.480 --> 20:42.470
What about Masha?

20:42.720 --> 20:44.712
<i>- Masha's still with Sam. He's not...
- Please.</i>

20:44.880 --> 20:46.712
I can go there. I can take care of her.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.870
- No.
- I...

20:48.040 --> 20:50.032
She won't be safe with you.
You know that.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.398
You have to disappear yourself, Kate.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.355
<i>There's nothing more you can do
for me or for Masha.</i>

20:58.440 --> 21:01.114
I'm begging you, Kate. Walk away.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.076
<i>You know how much I love her.</i>

21:04.600 --> 21:06.080
I do.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.116
You'll walk away, then.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.554
Yes.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.552
I love you, Kate.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.078
Look at this.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.799
You okay?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.355
Yeah.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.992
Hope you don't mind.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.311
I need saving from the wolves.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.274
If I had a hose I'd spray them down.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.120
I'm just passing through to Texas.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.954
My name's Annie Kaplan.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.033
What's yours?

23:01.800 --> 23:02.916
Kate.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.200
You wanna dance, Kate?

23:06.200 --> 23:07.270
What?

23:11.760 --> 23:13.353
Come on.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.317
What's wrong, Kate?

23:33.800 --> 23:36.269
My friend just died.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.633
Oh, honey.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.199
Come here.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.072
I think she was my best friend.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.352
So what's next for you?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.671
You gonna find some more Russians
to live with?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.479
I don't know.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.115
I can't think about it right now.

24:15.280 --> 24:19.513
Masha and her family
were my whole world for so long.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.317
Well, there are other worlds out there.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.236
My future's in Amarillo.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.319
Lot of people sing about Amarillo,
you know.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.917
George Strait, Neil Sedaka...

24:33.080 --> 24:34.196
...Rob Zombie.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.353
Is that what's leading you there?

24:37.520 --> 24:38.840
No.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.311
That would be my Uncle Nikos.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.949
He's a bail bondsman.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.629
Gonna teach me everything he knows
about the business.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.597
Amarillo...

24:53.880 --> 24:56.679
What's the job market like there?

25:04.680 --> 25:07.718
I got off work early and I thought I'd...

25:09.200 --> 25:10.520
Kate, how do you do this?

25:10.680 --> 25:11.875
It takes some work.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.912
You have to wash the area with bleach...

25:14.120 --> 25:17.272
...and then you have to use
this EPA-approved disinfectant...

25:17.440 --> 25:19.636
There are jobs in Amarillo
that don't require...

25:19.840 --> 25:22.196
...being around blood and body organs
all day long.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.510
It doesn't bother me.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.434
I know.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.829
But that was before.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.270
Before what?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.832
Before me.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.239
Take those off.

25:38.200 --> 25:42.240
I want to meet the woman
who plays peek-a-boo...

25:42.400 --> 25:44.198
...who reads fairy tales...

25:44.720 --> 25:46.757
...who makes funny faces at babies.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.358
I never make funny faces
at babies, ever.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.878
Promise me you'll think
about a change of venue.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.110
For me.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.353
For you.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.110
Okay?

26:03.080 --> 26:04.116
Okay.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.357
Everett Oldfield.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.997
August 11th, 2006.

26:22.200 --> 26:26.114
Died of blunt force trauma
to the right temple.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.151
Knee surgery scar,
likely ACL reconstruction...

26:32.400 --> 26:33.959
...left leg.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.070
Wedding ring, left hand.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.678
Simple gold band.
Inscription: "All my love..."

26:53.120 --> 26:55.999
Hey. I thought you were working tonight.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.157
The Pattersons
canceled their dinner plans.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.755
They wanted a family night in
with the kids instead.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.632
So I got the night off.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.634
Is that chicken
and black bean sauce I smell?

27:07.800 --> 27:08.836
Here.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.354
Open it.

27:10.560 --> 27:15.396
You know, Little Nikos does not like it
when employees eat at the office.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.473
Well, Little Nikos...

27:18.880 --> 27:20.758
...can suck it.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.679
Romantic and saucy.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.559
I like it.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.796
Where's Little Nikos?

27:31.040 --> 27:34.431
I'm sorry, sir, we're closed.
You have to come back tomorrow.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.069
I missed my court appearance
because my daddy passed.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.469
I was at his funeral.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.038
There was no reason for Nikos
to send his dog Mato after me.

27:42.200 --> 27:45.193
That psychopath just broke
my brother's jaw looking for me.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.959
Okay, just...

27:47.120 --> 27:48.315
Just take this, all right?

27:48.560 --> 27:50.711
And go. We don't want any trouble.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.513
I don't want your money!

27:52.720 --> 27:55.360
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Annie Kaplan.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.791
I guess that makes you Mr. Kaplan.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.920
- Get your hand off that phone.
- Don't point that gun at her.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.197
Annie! No.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.400
Annie.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.314
Annie.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.636
Here we go.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.032
I know, it...

28:24.640 --> 28:27.314
You're okay.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.360
Oh, my God. No.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.359
Annie. No, no, no.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.029
Annie, stay awake.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.595
Annie, don't close...

28:37.760 --> 28:40.036
Don't close your eyes.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.473
Stay awake...

28:52.240 --> 28:53.515
Kate.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.239
Hello, Kate.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.675
Can you hear me?

28:56.920 --> 28:58.912
I'm Dr. Soska.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.679
Do you remember the shooting?

29:05.560 --> 29:06.630
Yes.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.196
Fortunately,
the bullet caught you at an angle.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.192
It was a perforating wound, in and out.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.239
No vital tissue was damaged.
There was quite a bit of swelling.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.951
We had to induce a coma to reduce it
and give your brain time to heal.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.836
How long?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.753
It's been three weeks, Kate.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.799
But they even installed an upgrade.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.830
Metal plate.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.994
Nikos.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.400
Where's Annie?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.477
I'll let you two talk.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.472
Nikos, where's Annie?

29:44.480 --> 29:45.755
I'm sorry, Katie.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.677
She was gone
before the ambulance even got there.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.552
Listen to me.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.276
Annie was my family.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.477
I know how she felt about you.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.035
How you felt about each other.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.152
And that makes you family.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.678
I will be here for you.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.515
And we will get through this together.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.474
How?

31:27.760 --> 31:28.830
Sam.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.272
What are you doing here?
Is it Elizabeth? Did something happen?

31:33.480 --> 31:35.551
- No, no, no.
- Is she hurt?

31:35.720 --> 31:36.710
Nothing happened.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.153
Then what are you doing here?

31:39.560 --> 31:41.916
Someone wants to see you.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.231
Asked me to come to you.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.914
Raymond Reddington.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.039
That man...

31:48.200 --> 31:52.911
...set off a chain reaction
that took everything I loved from me.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.676
And not just me.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.800
He turned his back on his family,
his country...

31:59.280 --> 32:01.351
...and for what?

32:01.680 --> 32:03.558
A life of crime?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.073
He's a traitor.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.754
I have nothing to say to him...

32:07.920 --> 32:10.276
...and I don't want
to hear anything he has to say.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.430
Yes, you do.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.320
Lizzy is fine now.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.790
But Red says she's in danger.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.669
What kind of danger?

32:18.840 --> 32:20.354
You'd have to ask him.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.200
And there's something he wants
to ask you.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.832
Work for you?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.434
I don't know you.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.793
I'm not as unknown as you might like
to believe, Miss Nemec.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.795
We shared the affection of Katarina...

32:36.000 --> 32:39.630
...and we have a common bond
in Elizabeth.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.759
I presume your love for the child abides.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.515
After Katarina's sudden departure...

32:46.680 --> 32:51.311
...I felt a responsibility
to watch over the girl from a distance.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.951
I've provided
for her and Sam financially.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.073
I'm surprised you found the time...

32:58.240 --> 33:00.550
...between selling illegal services...

33:00.720 --> 33:04.430
...or ordering hits on anyone
who got in your way.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.759
I make no apologies for who I am,
or what I do.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.794
Katarina was a traitor to two countries...

33:12.160 --> 33:14.231
...both global superpowers.

33:14.440 --> 33:20.072
God willing, Katarina's daughter will
live a private life of quiet courage.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.192
But if anyone learns her identity...

33:22.360 --> 33:25.478
...the only way I can stop the threats
from rising...

33:25.640 --> 33:29.429
...is to rise up
as a greater threat than all of them.

33:29.800 --> 33:34.397
So you want me
to join you in organized crime...

33:34.560 --> 33:36.392
...to protect Elizabeth?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.593
Yes, Kate.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.753
Help me protect the girl we love.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.595
And what do I have
that you could possibly want?

33:44.760 --> 33:46.274
A trusted voice.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.676
A cool head.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.197
Undaunted initiative...

33:51.400 --> 33:53.596
...in a messy situation.

33:54.320 --> 33:58.519
All the things that you gave
to Elizabeth's mother.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.074
If you put me in a position
where I have to choose...

34:03.240 --> 34:05.800
...between what's best for you...

34:05.960 --> 34:08.156
...and what's best for her...

34:08.760 --> 34:11.639
...I will choose Elizabeth every time.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.559
Yes.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.156
I would insist on that.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.674
Hello? Anyone in there?

34:27.360 --> 34:29.192
Highway patrol. Open up, please.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.397
Just a second.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.077
Sorry, officer. I was asleep.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.960
You been drinking, ma'am?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.315
No.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.597
No, I get migraines
and they affect my vision.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.480
But you're parked illegally.
On a county road.

34:47.639 --> 34:49.472
License and registration, please.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.840
Miss Snyder or Miss Phillips?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.118
- Which is it?
- It's not what you think.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.433
What I think is that showing a fake license
is a class four felony in this state.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.956
Why don't you go ahead
and step outside for me?

35:10.520 --> 35:11.636
Officer, I can explain.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.235
You'll have a chance to
after I search your vehicle.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.757
You're refusing my request
to search your vehicle?

35:23.960 --> 35:24.950
That is my right.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.955
It's my right to detain you while I phone
in a search warrant and radio for backup.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.636
I sure hope you slept,
because this is gonna be a long night.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.036
Wait.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.398
If you call this in he's gonna find me,
hurt me.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.717
- He's done it before.
- Who? Your husband?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.673
He wants to be.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.075
I sympathize. I do.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.430
But fake IDs.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.034
It's not the way to handle it.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.477
You need to report the son of a bitch.
Slap a restraining order on him.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.633
It's not that simple. He's a state judge.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.560
It's his word against mine...

35:56.800 --> 35:59.031
...and he knows what to say
and how to say it.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.795
There are support groups
or shelters you can go to.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.158
If your story checks out,
I'll even help you find one.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.034
But right now, I need to s...

36:09.680 --> 36:11.797
Oh, my God.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.076
Did he do that?

36:13.480 --> 36:15.995
Yes, officer. He did.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.075
Do you have a gun?

36:19.120 --> 36:20.349
I do.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.439
Drive this rig straight
to a state with stand-your-ground laws.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.557
Kansas, Georgia, Florida.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.120
If he shows up...

36:27.320 --> 36:29.312
...don't you hesitate.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.836
Mr. Kaplan,
how are you feeling this morning?

36:45.040 --> 36:46.360
Better. Thank you.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.240
I'm an hour out with the final shipment.
Room on the ice?

36:49.440 --> 36:52.080
All organized and ready for you.
Nothing to worry about.

36:58.120 --> 37:01.272
Assistant Director Harold Cooper
just arrived at headquarters.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.875
Now would be a good time to move.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.671
You can't just stroll into her life
after all these years.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.229
This is a mistake.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.551
I'm aware of your feelings, Kate.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.709
Raymond, stop.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.432
The instant you walk through that door,
the damage will be done.

37:18.600 --> 37:23.152
You'll destroy her innocence, everything
we've been fighting to preserve.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.552
You'll never undo it.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.114
As I feared would happen...

37:27.280 --> 37:30.398
...elements from Katarina's past
are circling Elizabeth...

37:30.600 --> 37:32.512
...like a pack of wolves in the night.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.354
I put Tom Keen in her life
to keep an eye on her...

37:35.560 --> 37:37.040
...and he married her.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.237
This isn't about Tom Keen.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.954
It's about your need for control.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.238
Indeed, I need to control the danger
to Elizabeth.

37:44.400 --> 37:49.350
I've built a vast criminal network
predicated on that very principle.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.638
It's time to live up
to my mission statement.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.997
It must be good to be home again, sir.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.234
Yeah.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.351
Well, we'll see about that.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.718
He'll be fine.
He's in FBI custody.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.513
What's the worst that could happen?

39:12.360 --> 39:13.714
Hello, Raymond.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.713
Hello, Kate.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.390
It took some searching.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.394
We found your friend's phone...

39:21.200 --> 39:24.079
<i>...buried in the rubble.
- I knew you'd survive the blast.</i>

39:24.280 --> 39:28.354
I tried to warn him,
but he was very proud of his bushcraft.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.234
He would've made you proud
right to the end.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.598
You know how to engender loyalty
in others, Kate.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.790
You always have.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.834
I've been thinking about you.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.879
Happy thoughts?

39:40.240 --> 39:44.154
I realize now I was so wrapped up
in helping you build your empire...

39:44.360 --> 39:47.512
...I lost sight of why I joined you
in the first place.

39:47.960 --> 39:52.193
Somewhere along the way, I stopped
serving Liz's needs to enable yours.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.278
They're one and the same.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.193
They always have been.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.317
What we've done, we've done for her.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.796
I believed that, Raymond.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.720
Like a pied piper, you made me believe.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.752
But when I did what was best for her...

40:06.000 --> 40:07.992
It wasn't best.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.391
You almost got her killed
and you betrayed me.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.473
No. I kept my word to you.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.673
When you hired me, you told me
to choose Elizabeth over you.

40:16.840 --> 40:22.234
And so I tried to help her disappear to
a safe place with her newborn daughter...

40:22.640 --> 40:25.712
...and for that you put me down
like a mad dog.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.398
<i>For the last two decades of my life...</i>

40:28.560 --> 40:31.758
...you had me convinced
I was helping keep Elizabeth safe...

40:31.920 --> 40:34.754
...but in reality
I was helping you become a monster.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.077
It's time for us to meet and talk.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.276
<i>No, Raymond.</i>

40:38.640 --> 40:41.599
I'm going to do
what I should have done years ago.

40:41.800 --> 40:46.397
It took a bullet to my head but I remember
what my father taught me.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.392
Our stories are written in flesh.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.876
And I'm gonna use that lesson
to render you powerless.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.831
Are you familiar
with Master James of St. George?

40:59.160 --> 41:01.720
<i>Favored architect of Edward I.</i>

41:01.880 --> 41:02.916
<i>Do you know why?</i>

41:03.120 --> 41:04.713
Concentric construction.

41:04.880 --> 41:08.874
He literally built castles within castles.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.599
Impossible to penetrate.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.513
You could breach the outer wall...

41:12.680 --> 41:17.038
...only to be faced with a heavily
fortified gate house and barbican...

41:17.240 --> 41:20.119
...and a high inner wall
lined with archers.

41:20.560 --> 41:24.270
<i>Pity the poor foot soldier
who made it that far.</i>

41:24.480 --> 41:31.876
The architecture of my organization
has risen, stone by stone, over decades.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.276
You can't get inside to hurt me, Kate.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.830
<i>You forget I was
by your side the whole time.</i>

41:37.160 --> 41:39.755
I know what was required
to amass your power...

41:39.920 --> 41:44.073
...who you hurt, who you betrayed,
who you killed.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.950
More importantly, as your cleaner,
I know where the bodies are buried.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.352
Were buried, deary.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.671
And I'm going to use them...

41:57.160 --> 42:00.915
...and the stories they tell
to put you in the ground.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.711
You've been busy.
