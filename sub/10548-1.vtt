00:32.115 --> 00:34.413
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

00:34.918 --> 00:38.786
<i>Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,</i>
<i>I've had to laugh.</i>

00:39.989 --> 00:42.321
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

00:42.492 --> 00:46.929
<i>What for? And from what?</i>
<i>From ourselves?</i>

00:48.031 --> 00:49.589
<i>Life's simple:</i>

00:49.766 --> 00:53.429
<i>Kill or be killed,</i>
<i>don't get involved...</i>

00:53.603 --> 00:56.470
<i>... and always finish the job.</i>

00:56.806 --> 00:58.364
<i>The survivor's code.</i>

00:58.541 --> 01:00.600
<i>My code.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:06.007
<i>And it all sounds great until the day you</i>
<i>find yourself confronted by a choice.</i>

01:06.783 --> 01:10.048
<i>A choice to make a difference,</i>
<i>to help someone...</i>

01:10.253 --> 01:13.279
<i>... or to walk away and save yourself.</i>

01:13.690 --> 01:16.124
<i>I learned something that day.</i>

01:16.292 --> 01:18.954
<i>You can't always walk away.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:23.128
<i>Too bad it was the day I died.</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:15.301
Get out here!

03:17.113 --> 03:18.671
Come here!

03:19.816 --> 03:21.408
Get back!

03:24.487 --> 03:26.148
You remember me?

03:26.322 --> 03:29.086
You sold me a gun that don't work!
You almost got me killed!

03:29.259 --> 03:31.489
I paid $20 for this.
I want my money back.

03:35.899 --> 03:37.298
Give me that.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.001
This one's very good, very good.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.522
Okay.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.067
I owe you.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.438
I'll save you some.

04:40.263 --> 04:43.858
Hey, Toorop. Toorop.
Somebody came here looking for you.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.098
Okay.

05:01.017 --> 05:02.712
<i>Boy, what a massacre.</i>

05:09.759 --> 05:13.923
<i>At the peak of the rush hour,</i>
<i>bombs were detonated in...</i>

05:49.465 --> 05:51.899
Karl, is that you?

05:54.170 --> 05:56.934
I thought you were in Sudan
killing babies.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.565
Remember the last time we met?

05:59.742 --> 06:02.836
I told you if you ever
point that gun at me again...

06:04.113 --> 06:05.944
...l'd kill you.

06:06.249 --> 06:09.548
Who would hire a baby killer
to get me?

06:14.290 --> 06:15.621
Who?

06:17.126 --> 06:20.095
No shit. If you wanted me dead,
you'd have blown up the building.

06:20.263 --> 06:21.662
Who?

06:21.831 --> 06:23.162
Gorsky.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.696
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.466
You're not a mercenary,
you're a terrorist.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.943
You need two things to live in this
business, your balls and your word.

06:38.114 --> 06:39.877
You don't have either.

06:41.017 --> 06:43.485
You know the difference
between you and me, Karl?

06:45.855 --> 06:47.516
I still got both.

06:50.393 --> 06:51.951
Take it easy.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.859
Personal between him and me.

08:02.532 --> 08:05.729
You are a hard man to find, Toorop.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.463
I'm not hiding.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.064
You could have knocked.

08:13.176 --> 08:16.236
I needed to be sure
that you were the same idealist...

08:16.412 --> 08:19.711
...who worked for me 10 years ago.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.442
So you knew I was gonna kill Karl?

08:25.054 --> 08:27.249
I don't like you, Gorsky.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.823
You can't trust me
and I can't trust you.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.755
Look at you.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.125
Still in this shit hole, surviving.

08:35.298 --> 08:38.461
No friends, no family, no future.

08:38.634 --> 08:42.001
We are the same. You and me.

08:42.205 --> 08:44.196
We're not the same.

08:44.974 --> 08:46.100
What do you want?

08:46.742 --> 08:48.073
I need a smuggler.

08:48.244 --> 08:50.576
I don't do refugees anymore.

08:50.746 --> 08:51.940
Use your own cargo.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.810
- You own the borders anyway.
- Only on this side.

08:54.984 --> 08:57.680
- This is an overseas delivery?
- A girl.

08:57.853 --> 09:00.014
She needs to be in America
in six days.

09:00.723 --> 09:02.520
Why are you playing with me?

09:02.725 --> 09:05.455
You know I can't get back
into that country.

09:05.628 --> 09:09.029
You know that U.N. passports
are impossible to fake.

09:14.604 --> 09:16.765
This is not a fake.

09:16.939 --> 09:21.035
Inject it in your neck
when you pass the official border.

09:21.244 --> 09:23.144
This is your new life.

09:24.947 --> 09:26.380
I'll do it for half a mil.

09:26.549 --> 09:28.107
I can make you do it for free.

09:28.284 --> 09:31.617
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

09:31.887 --> 09:35.118
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.317
A car will pick you up outside.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.622
Everything you need
will be in the trunk.

09:41.797 --> 09:46.632
Cross me and you'll have no place
to hide anymore...

09:47.336 --> 09:48.997
...Toorop.

09:50.706 --> 09:53.368
It goes both ways...

09:53.576 --> 09:55.476
...Gorsky.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.883
Shit.

12:45.948 --> 12:47.074
Good morning.

12:47.249 --> 12:49.479
You must be Toorop.

12:49.885 --> 12:51.250
I am Sister Rebeka.

12:51.454 --> 12:54.218
I want to bring three simple rules
to your attention...

12:54.390 --> 12:56.415
...before we start our journey.

12:56.592 --> 12:58.059
We?

12:58.260 --> 13:00.057
I'm here to pick up one girl.

13:00.229 --> 13:04.598
Wherever she goes, I go.
That is rule number one.

13:04.767 --> 13:08.760
Rule number two, the less contact she
has with the outside world, the better.

13:08.971 --> 13:12.031
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.769
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.843
Now, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

13:19.014 --> 13:22.006
I know. That is why we live in here.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.548
Shit. Okay, what's your third rule?

13:26.722 --> 13:28.553
No foul language.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.759
Do we have an agreement?

13:39.101 --> 13:42.127
You listen to my one and only rule.

13:44.373 --> 13:45.635
Don't fuck with me...

13:46.008 --> 13:48.909
...or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

13:49.078 --> 13:52.309
...with nothing but your ass to sell
to get back here...

13:52.515 --> 13:54.915
...your perfect world.

13:55.551 --> 13:57.542
Do we have an agreement?

13:58.554 --> 14:00.545
Obviously, you are not a gentleman.

14:00.723 --> 14:02.384
Obviously not.

14:04.326 --> 14:08.456
Now that we have an understanding,
pick up the bags.

14:13.068 --> 14:14.933
No.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.677
What's your name?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.517
My name?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.686
You don't have to talk to him.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.052
You didn't introduce yourself.

15:45.661 --> 15:47.128
My name is Toorop.

15:48.263 --> 15:51.164
- Are you taking us to New York?
- Yes.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.733
Now please get into the car.

15:55.671 --> 15:57.730
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

15:59.708 --> 16:03.075
Look, lady. I'm just a delivery boy.

16:03.245 --> 16:05.543
And to me you're just a package.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.115
I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother,
I'm not your boyfriend.

16:09.284 --> 16:12.515
In six days, I'm gonna deliver you
and never see you again.

16:13.455 --> 16:16.049
Sister Rebeka's right.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.125
We shouldn't even talk.

16:18.293 --> 16:19.692
Come on.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.696
Comfy?

17:08.477 --> 17:11.969
Your Highness,
your child has left the convent.

17:12.146 --> 17:14.273
At last.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.318
Six days until we reveal our miracle
to the world.

17:23.925 --> 17:27.020
Your Highness,
the press conference will begin shortly.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.328
She's coming.

17:33.502 --> 17:35.333
Let's pray.

18:04.299 --> 18:07.632
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

18:09.138 --> 18:11.299
Take your bags.

18:13.275 --> 18:15.072
Are you really going to need all that?

18:15.277 --> 18:18.144
You can never have enough firepower,
Sister.

18:18.313 --> 18:20.042
In fact...

18:20.382 --> 18:22.407
Never touched a gun in my life.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.643
Now would be the perfect moment
to start.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.812
No, thank you. I can defend myself.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.592
Stay close, this is the real world.
There's no mercy for the weak.

18:32.795 --> 18:35.821
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

18:35.998 --> 18:37.863
It does here.

18:44.439 --> 18:45.929
Hurry.

18:47.676 --> 18:49.109
Change.

18:49.311 --> 18:50.835
What are you doing?

18:51.346 --> 18:53.541
<i>We've located the targets.</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:55.740
<i>Contact New York.</i>

18:56.251 --> 18:58.685
<i>Patch me through to Darquandier.</i>

18:58.854 --> 19:00.719
They found her.

19:00.923 --> 19:02.550
Okay.

19:02.825 --> 19:04.725
Be careful now.

19:05.928 --> 19:08.089
Noelites would be watching too.

19:08.263 --> 19:09.855
My daughter must not be harmed.

19:10.032 --> 19:11.932
<i>Put this on.</i>

19:14.069 --> 19:15.730
Come on.

19:16.972 --> 19:20.100
I'm scared. Can I hold your hand?

19:21.777 --> 19:23.438
Hold mine.

20:13.762 --> 20:15.491
Hang on.

20:15.664 --> 20:17.928
Okay, give me three.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.595
Hey.

20:27.009 --> 20:28.909
Where are you going?

20:43.859 --> 20:46.419
What are you doing? Come on.

21:07.049 --> 21:08.209
Hey.

21:08.884 --> 21:10.818
Hey!

21:10.986 --> 21:12.385
Hey, come here.

21:12.554 --> 21:14.351
Hey!

21:30.072 --> 21:31.835
<i>- She's on the run.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

21:32.007 --> 21:33.599
Aurora. Toorop.

21:36.111 --> 21:37.738
Aurora. Toorop.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.518
- What are you doing?
<i>- Stop.</i>

21:47.689 --> 21:49.623
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.349
We have to go. We have no time.

21:51.526 --> 21:52.754
- Now.
- We have to get away.

21:52.928 --> 21:55.123
What's wrong?
Make her walk or I'll carry her.

21:55.297 --> 21:58.061
- Stop. Don't touch her.
- We gotta leave. We're going.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.098
- Don't touch her.
- You will die. No!

22:14.116 --> 22:15.777
Come on.

22:22.457 --> 22:23.924
We're going to the train.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.925
We need to catch it. Come on.

22:50.352 --> 22:51.785
Move. Get out of the way.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.113
Move!

23:09.104 --> 23:11.868
Those tigers in the cage.

23:12.074 --> 23:14.474
They weren't real, right?

23:17.312 --> 23:21.146
Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.077
The last one died in the Moscow Zoo.

23:25.687 --> 23:28.520
What is she,
a walking wildlife encyclopedia?

23:29.624 --> 23:31.023
They were clones?

23:32.227 --> 23:35.719
Second generation clones.
Not real tigers.

23:35.897 --> 23:37.057
Copies of copies.

23:37.232 --> 23:39.564
But they're living creatures.

23:39.734 --> 23:40.860
Made by God.

23:41.169 --> 23:44.866
No, they were organic machines
made by man.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.235
God made man in his image...

23:47.409 --> 23:49.969
...so, what man creates
is also God's will.

23:50.145 --> 23:52.238
Is this what you teach her
in the convent?

23:53.415 --> 23:54.882
You wanna talk?

23:55.050 --> 23:57.712
Tell me what happened
at the marketplace.

23:57.886 --> 24:00.514
How did you know
about the explosion?

24:01.323 --> 24:04.019
If I'm gonna protect you...

24:04.659 --> 24:06.524
...I need to know
what's wrong with you.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.324
She was scared.

24:10.499 --> 24:12.558
It's her first time out of the convent.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.362
And you put us in that situation.

24:17.572 --> 24:21.941
<i>Your attention, please. We are about to</i>
<i>pass through high-radiation smog.</i>

24:22.144 --> 24:25.204
<i>For your security,</i>
<i>the shutters will now be lowered.</i>

24:25.380 --> 24:27.871
First time out of the convent, huh?

26:05.947 --> 26:08.040
Stay close.

26:09.451 --> 26:12.352
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a friend.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.648
Must be somewhere around here.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.028
Come on, come on.

26:30.205 --> 26:33.697
It's a glorious game.
Marcus from gracious England...

26:33.875 --> 26:37.402
...against the Killa from China.
Only one round.

26:37.779 --> 26:40.270
You can make it.

26:51.393 --> 26:53.054
<i>I got them. They're right here.</i>

26:53.228 --> 26:56.322
<i>I'll be right there in a minute.</i>
<i>And you, don't talk to anybody.</i>

26:56.498 --> 26:59.023
They're splitting up.
What do we do now?

26:59.434 --> 27:01.925
Everybody maintain their position.

27:03.004 --> 27:05.234
Get up, Finn.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.801
Hey, Toorop.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.440
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

27:11.613 --> 27:14.104
What you doing in this beautiful
part of Russia?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.874
<i>- Working.</i>
<i>- Working for who?</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:19.612
<i>Hey, hey, two shots.</i>

27:20.188 --> 27:21.212
<i>Gorsky.</i>

27:26.628 --> 27:28.926
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

27:30.632 --> 27:34.568
- What can I do for you?
- I need three passes on the boat.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.761
And two snow bikes
on the other side.

27:36.938 --> 27:39.702
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering.

27:40.842 --> 27:42.366
A girl.

27:43.978 --> 27:45.377
Her?

27:45.547 --> 27:47.208
Who is she?

27:48.083 --> 27:49.107
I don't know.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.408
- Where are you taking her?
- America.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.315
You're on the terrorist list there.

27:53.488 --> 27:55.786
- Yeah.
- You know that. You need a passport.

27:55.957 --> 27:57.549
You need an identity.

27:57.726 --> 27:59.921
You're kidding me.
You got a passport?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.756
Yeah, and I'm not coming back.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.991
- That is a bold move.
- I got 50 G's saying you can help out.

28:06.468 --> 28:07.958
When?

28:08.603 --> 28:09.627
Now.

28:14.309 --> 28:15.742
You don't have to look.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.777
Who is he?

28:23.485 --> 28:25.646
He's a lost soul.

28:33.995 --> 28:36.190
See you at the landing at 0600 sharp.

28:36.398 --> 28:37.990
You got it.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.161
- Who is that?
- An old friend, a good smuggler.

28:41.336 --> 28:44.396
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anybody. Come on.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.473
- Sorry, kids, these girls are with me.
- Just let her go, Toorop.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.673
- How do you know my name?
- We know a lot of things you don't.

28:55.850 --> 28:59.217
- Yeah? Like what?
- Like you don't know what you're doing.

28:59.687 --> 29:01.621
- I'm doing my job.
- Forget your job.

29:01.790 --> 29:05.191
- What?
- One million, tax-free.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.689
Take the money
and walk out without a fight.

29:11.866 --> 29:13.561
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

29:25.547 --> 29:26.536
Go!

29:40.028 --> 29:41.495
Move!

30:38.219 --> 30:39.311
Aurora.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.658
Hey!

30:54.068 --> 30:56.901
- Aurora.
- Hey, man, let the girl go.

30:57.071 --> 30:58.834
Just let her go. Let her go.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.974
Another one is about to die.

31:01.142 --> 31:03.167
A new opponent for the Killa.

31:10.752 --> 31:13.550
Hey, man, hey, hey. I don't...

31:18.359 --> 31:19.621
Get over there.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.955
Wanna fight? Let's go.

31:25.567 --> 31:26.932
No!

31:39.213 --> 31:40.612
Aurora.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.195
Stop!

31:57.365 --> 31:59.026
Stop it!

31:59.400 --> 32:01.732
Stop it! Stop!

32:03.972 --> 32:05.837
Don't kill him.

32:08.876 --> 32:11.640
He doesn't want to hurt me.

32:16.651 --> 32:18.414
He wanted to protect me!

32:22.724 --> 32:23.816
Your father sent us.

32:24.993 --> 32:27.894
- My father?
- Yes, your father.

32:28.062 --> 32:30.360
Get away from her.
Get away from her.

32:31.132 --> 32:32.531
It's okay, Aurora.

32:33.635 --> 32:36.433
- I have to know.
- No, Aurora.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.839
Aurora? Aurora. Aurora!

32:39.007 --> 32:40.099
Listen to me. Stop.

32:40.274 --> 32:42.868
Toorop. Toorop.

32:50.284 --> 32:52.013
Come on.

33:09.203 --> 33:10.534
Let's go. Hurry up.

33:12.540 --> 33:14.474
Come on.

33:14.676 --> 33:15.734
Move it.

33:16.377 --> 33:18.140
Come on.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.075
Go, go, go.

33:33.995 --> 33:35.394
Let her go!

33:41.903 --> 33:43.996
Next one dies.

33:47.008 --> 33:49.738
Come with us.
They're ready to die for you.

33:49.911 --> 33:51.640
I don't want anybody to die for me.

34:02.690 --> 34:04.089
What do you think you're doing?

34:04.258 --> 34:06.453
- What's wrong with you?
- Think this is a game?

34:06.627 --> 34:08.652
- Why did you shoot?
- Trying to get killed?

34:08.830 --> 34:10.456
- Why didn't you let me go?
- You don't know them!

34:10.630 --> 34:14.328
And what are you gonna do? Shoot me
in the head? Swing on me like an animal?

34:14.735 --> 34:16.293
Stop it.

34:23.277 --> 34:25.541
I told you I'd take you to New York.

34:25.746 --> 34:26.839
And I will.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.946
You don't have to like me.

34:35.123 --> 34:38.183
Is my father really alive?

34:39.127 --> 34:41.288
No, baby girl.

34:42.396 --> 34:44.364
He died.

34:57.043 --> 34:59.376
This is way too many refugees,
man.

34:59.547 --> 35:02.209
The ice is getting thinner every year.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.715
We're losing cargo all the time.

35:07.889 --> 35:10.687
We're not gonna all get on the boat.

35:11.492 --> 35:13.653
Make sure we do.

35:14.228 --> 35:18.528
This goddamn global warming
is bad for business.

35:35.683 --> 35:37.617
What's happening?

35:38.553 --> 35:39.952
Watch this.

36:27.635 --> 36:29.227
There's not much time.

36:29.403 --> 36:31.462
They don't wanna be spotted
by satellites.

36:31.639 --> 36:33.664
Hurry, come on.

36:34.876 --> 36:37.071
<i>Diving in two minutes.</i>

36:55.263 --> 36:57.663
<i>Diving in one minute.</i>

36:58.266 --> 36:59.665
<i>One minute.</i>

37:05.640 --> 37:06.698
Go.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.935
Come on.

37:35.436 --> 37:37.461
No!

37:45.546 --> 37:47.480
No!

37:51.452 --> 37:52.851
You can't do this.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.351
They'll die out there.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.887
No!

37:57.758 --> 38:00.249
- You can't do this.
- Get away from the controls.

38:00.461 --> 38:02.656
- What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it.
- No.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.354
Don't do that. What's wrong?

38:05.333 --> 38:06.732
- Put it down.
- No, don't.

38:06.901 --> 38:08.664
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You, put it down.

38:08.836 --> 38:11.066
- Hey, take it easy.
- Hey, take it easy.

38:12.673 --> 38:14.607
- Put it down.
- We go back up.

38:14.775 --> 38:17.505
- Now.
- Okay, okay.

38:18.412 --> 38:20.403
- Relax.
- We go back up.

38:20.581 --> 38:23.106
- Easy.
- Now.

38:24.085 --> 38:25.609
- Relax, stay put.
- No.

38:25.786 --> 38:26.844
Calm down.

38:27.021 --> 38:28.955
- Put her on the floor.
- I feel them dying.

38:29.123 --> 38:32.183
No, no mercy. Dead!

38:39.633 --> 38:44.730
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the hell was that?

38:50.244 --> 38:54.704
I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco.

38:55.116 --> 38:57.243
My life was a mess.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.579
I met the wrong man.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.416
I was lost in darkness.

39:03.057 --> 39:05.753
But the high priestess of our church
opened the doors...

39:05.926 --> 39:08.827
...that led onto the path of light.

39:10.398 --> 39:12.764
I joined the Noelites...

39:12.933 --> 39:15.663
...and I ended up in the convent.

39:15.836 --> 39:20.102
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

39:21.075 --> 39:23.805
I worked in the orphanage.

39:25.846 --> 39:27.905
She arrived.

39:28.816 --> 39:30.909
A little baby.

39:31.752 --> 39:33.743
Her father was dead.

39:33.921 --> 39:36.412
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.425
I took her as my own.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.091
I fed her.

39:41.262 --> 39:42.854
I taught her.

39:43.064 --> 39:47.933
Everything was fine
until three months ago.

39:48.335 --> 39:50.530
The doctor came and gave her a pill.

39:50.704 --> 39:52.331
He was with her for 10 minutes...

39:52.506 --> 39:54.804
...and then she slowly started...

39:54.975 --> 39:56.101
To change, huh?

39:56.610 --> 39:58.305
Schizophrenia.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.674
Spasms.

40:01.215 --> 40:05.208
Nothing as violent
as what you saw today.

40:05.386 --> 40:08.947
Now, how could she know how
to operate a 30-year-old Russian sub?

40:10.491 --> 40:14.393
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

40:14.595 --> 40:18.326
Aurora could speak
when she was 2 years old.

40:18.599 --> 40:21.295
Yeah, but there are kids
that can speak at 2 years old.

40:21.469 --> 40:23.494
Nineteen different languages?

40:28.709 --> 40:30.574
Who else knows about this?

40:30.744 --> 40:32.644
Nobody but the doctor.

40:32.813 --> 40:35.680
He told me to keep it a secret
to protect her.

40:38.152 --> 40:39.847
He said...

40:40.020 --> 40:44.116
...that we would get
the best medical help in America.

40:46.060 --> 40:48.392
She needs help.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.628
<i>Crew, prepare to surface.</i>

40:54.568 --> 40:56.559
Get her ready.

41:14.288 --> 41:16.756
You know, two years ago...

41:17.725 --> 41:21.684
...in Uzbekistan,
I saw this viral bomb go off.

41:23.197 --> 41:25.757
I saw it from the air. It was...

41:28.402 --> 41:30.700
...incredible. Everybody died.

41:32.940 --> 41:35.170
She's carrying, ain't she?

41:36.177 --> 41:37.974
All the symptoms fit.

41:38.179 --> 41:40.147
All that weird behavior.

41:40.314 --> 41:43.909
I'm telling you, man,
she's carrying a weapon.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.814
Do you have any idea
how much money she's worth?

41:48.489 --> 41:51.287
If she's carrying a virus...

41:54.094 --> 41:57.495
...l'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

42:18.919 --> 42:19.943
What happened to them?

42:20.120 --> 42:21.178
Fighter drones.

42:21.355 --> 42:23.118
Anything that moves
is shot on sight.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.917
It's 10 miles to the DMZ.

42:25.092 --> 42:28.584
Then let's make it 10 fast miles.
Let's go.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.006
Toorop, they're coming.

42:46.180 --> 42:47.875
Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!

42:59.193 --> 43:00.251
Brake!

43:05.899 --> 43:07.867
Finn, get close to me.

43:08.902 --> 43:10.665
Jump onto his bike.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.139
I'll draw them off.

44:01.588 --> 44:04.250
- What are you doing?
- Toorop cleared our way out.

44:04.425 --> 44:07.019
We're only a mile from the border.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.224
- Toorop, we need help.
- Don't worry.

44:15.402 --> 44:16.426
We're almost there.

44:22.609 --> 44:24.133
Toorop, we need you now.

44:24.345 --> 44:26.074
Hang on, I'm getting there.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.354
Stop! We have to get Toorop.

45:00.681 --> 45:02.376
Toorop.

45:03.917 --> 45:05.248
He's not dead.

45:07.020 --> 45:08.510
Oh, shit.

45:08.689 --> 45:10.486
Hey, stay with me.

45:12.025 --> 45:15.290
He's not reacting.
He's bleeding to death.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.090
I need your help. Okay.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.827
We gotta get out of here now.

45:24.004 --> 45:26.802
It's a small piece of metal.
I'm gonna take it out.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.465
- What do you need?
- Just hold him.

45:32.346 --> 45:34.280
Look, we don't have time
for this, okay?

45:34.448 --> 45:36.177
They're gonna send more drones.

45:36.350 --> 45:38.045
Aurora?

45:39.520 --> 45:42.182
- You got it?
- I got it.

45:42.356 --> 45:44.153
- He's okay.
- Give me a bandage.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.815
We should never have turned back.

45:48.061 --> 45:50.029
He knows the rules.

45:50.697 --> 45:52.824
I'll sew it up later.

45:54.301 --> 45:55.825
Hey...

45:56.537 --> 45:59.062
...now you
and the passport are mine.

45:59.239 --> 46:02.640
- What are you doing?
- You, I don't need.

46:14.888 --> 46:16.685
Like I said...

46:16.857 --> 46:18.188
...trust no one.

46:18.358 --> 46:20.223
Remember that.

46:27.334 --> 46:29.427
It's good.
Where did you learn to cook?

46:29.603 --> 46:32.163
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

46:32.339 --> 46:34.239
You never had a woman
take care of you?

46:37.211 --> 46:39.008
Sorry.

46:39.780 --> 46:41.372
No, not in my line of work.

46:44.418 --> 46:46.045
Finished.

46:46.553 --> 46:49.215
- She gets pleasure out of this.
- Crybaby.

46:49.389 --> 46:51.380
Crybaby?

46:56.129 --> 46:57.892
What is that?

46:58.632 --> 46:59.860
Painkiller?

47:00.567 --> 47:01.932
No, thank you.

47:02.102 --> 47:05.037
- Live a little.
- No.

47:05.205 --> 47:07.366
- Aurora, stop.
- Wait, let...

47:08.375 --> 47:10.104
Spit it out.

47:17.384 --> 47:19.011
Girls.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.580
We made it across the border.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.446
Here's to survival...

47:24.725 --> 47:26.818
...and thank you for saving my life.

47:27.027 --> 47:29.291
Maybe now you can trust somebody.

47:31.965 --> 47:35.662
We protected each other like family.

47:42.409 --> 47:44.775
We are all going to die in New York.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.779
Good night.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.697
She's just scared.

48:06.934 --> 48:08.993
Yeah, right.

48:36.830 --> 48:39.025
Go back to sleep.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.996
We still have a long way ahead of us.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.297
What are you doing?

48:47.107 --> 48:49.701
We go through customs tomorrow.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.608
Can't take these.

49:01.888 --> 49:05.847
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first found me as a baby...

49:06.026 --> 49:08.426
...it was a night like this.

49:09.863 --> 49:11.558
Aurora.

49:11.999 --> 49:14.229
That's where I got my name.

49:14.401 --> 49:16.062
From the chaos.

49:16.236 --> 49:17.726
It suits you.

49:20.073 --> 49:22.541
You're risking your life for me.

49:23.443 --> 49:24.535
Why?

49:27.147 --> 49:29.377
I've done my time.

49:30.384 --> 49:33.581
All this killing and pain...

49:33.754 --> 49:36.279
...and war for what?

49:37.858 --> 49:39.883
I'm tired.

49:41.028 --> 49:43.258
I'm tired of it all.

49:43.597 --> 49:45.792
You're my only chance
out of this hell.

49:45.966 --> 49:47.456
And go where?

49:49.536 --> 49:53.028
27 Cedar Grove...

49:54.074 --> 49:56.941
...near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

49:58.045 --> 50:00.479
My parents had a farm.

50:01.815 --> 50:05.114
More like a cabin with a lot of land.

50:05.686 --> 50:09.053
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.823
There is no place like home.

50:20.333 --> 50:22.995
Well, Kansas ain't what it used to be.

50:23.503 --> 50:24.936
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

50:25.772 --> 50:28.332
1939.

50:28.608 --> 50:30.439
That's right.

50:38.485 --> 50:40.112
Toorop.

50:44.791 --> 50:48.420
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

50:51.531 --> 50:53.965
I hope I won't have to.

52:47.547 --> 52:50.607
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

52:50.784 --> 52:54.550
There's a plane to New York
in two hours.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.064
<i>Passengers for Flight 712</i>
<i>to New York...</i>

53:12.239 --> 53:16.300
<i>... please proceed to Gate 211</i>
<i>for immediate boarding.</i>

53:18.778 --> 53:23.147
<i>You are now leaving Canada.</i>
<i>We hope you enjoyed your stay.</i>

53:23.316 --> 53:27.116
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the United States of America.</i>

53:35.161 --> 53:36.958
Welcome to America.

53:38.031 --> 53:39.328
Welcome to America.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.101
Welcome to America.

53:43.603 --> 53:45.264
Stop.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.167
Hold it right there.

53:48.341 --> 53:49.603
- Hey.
- I said, hold it.

53:49.776 --> 53:51.710
- Calm down.
- Hey.

54:44.030 --> 54:46.464
<i>A miracle in the making.</i>

55:01.114 --> 55:04.709
<i>Tomorrow is the dawn</i>
<i>of our new age.</i>

55:32.946 --> 55:37.246
Harlem, we've changed.
We've changed.

55:42.622 --> 55:44.783
Right here, girls.

55:56.969 --> 56:00.461
It's okay. It's safe here.

56:23.996 --> 56:25.623
Here.

56:29.368 --> 56:30.926
Can we turn it off?

56:31.103 --> 56:32.297
You can't turn it off.

56:32.471 --> 56:33.938
You can change the channel.

56:41.680 --> 56:43.147
Hey.

56:43.315 --> 56:45.180
There's no food.

56:45.517 --> 56:47.781
Because we're not
gonna be here long.

56:55.794 --> 56:57.159
What's wrong?

56:57.362 --> 56:59.592
They're all dead.

57:02.134 --> 57:06.662
<i>Sources report the destruction in</i>
<i>Kirghizstan of a 1000-year-old convent.</i>

57:06.839 --> 57:11.071
<i>One of the oldest continually functioning</i>
<i>convents in Central Asia.</i>

57:11.243 --> 57:14.007
<i>Now occupied by an ascetic branch</i>
<i>of the Noelites...</i>

57:14.179 --> 57:16.841
<i>... the convent was struck by a missile</i>
<i>late last night.</i>

57:17.015 --> 57:18.482
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

57:18.650 --> 57:21.642
<i>Here, an initial reaction</i>
<i>from the Noelites.</i>

57:21.820 --> 57:25.187
<i>It is a tragedy to think</i>
<i>that even defenseless women...</i>

57:25.357 --> 57:29.851
<i>... who made the choice to withdraw</i>
<i>from society and lead a life of purity...</i>

57:30.028 --> 57:32.189
<i>... should suffer the attacks</i>
<i>of terrorists...</i>

57:32.364 --> 57:37.893
<i>... who have absolutely no respect for</i>
<i>the lives of decent, God-fearing people.</i>

57:38.570 --> 57:40.538
<i>We shall mourn our Sisters.</i>

57:41.373 --> 57:44.035
<i>The Noelites have been persecuted</i>
<i>for too long.</i>

57:44.209 --> 57:47.007
<i>Tomorrow will be the dawn</i>
<i>of our new age.</i>

57:51.850 --> 57:54.717
<i>Congratulations, my friend.</i>

57:54.887 --> 57:57.014
<i>You made it safe and sound.</i>

57:57.189 --> 57:58.918
Gorsky.

57:59.091 --> 58:02.925
- Did you destroy that convent?
<i>- I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.</i>

58:03.095 --> 58:06.292
<i>- I'm a mercenary like you.</i>
- Bullshit.

58:06.465 --> 58:07.898
What the hell is going...?

58:08.066 --> 58:09.795
What the hell is going on over here?

58:09.968 --> 58:12.459
- You didn't leave me a gun?
<i>- You've done your job.</i>

58:12.671 --> 58:16.767
<i>When you turn over the girl, I'll get paid</i>
<i>and you're home free.</i>

58:16.942 --> 58:21.242
<i>And the tracking device in your passport</i>
<i>will be deactivated.</i>

58:21.413 --> 58:23.040
<i>Deliver the package.</i>

58:23.215 --> 58:26.378
<i>My men will be there</i>
<i>to be sure you do.</i>

58:27.686 --> 58:29.745
They never hurt anybody.

58:29.922 --> 58:31.947
Maybe it was an accident.

58:32.124 --> 58:34.786
It was not an accident.

58:35.460 --> 58:39.089
It was destroyed
right after we crossed the border.

58:41.466 --> 58:43.957
Would you like to pray with me?

58:45.103 --> 58:47.697
I don't feel like praying anymore.

58:56.982 --> 59:00.213
Toorop said
I'm just a package to him.

59:02.921 --> 59:04.513
Is that all I am to you?

59:06.258 --> 59:08.123
Of course not.

59:08.594 --> 59:10.357
I love you.

59:27.479 --> 59:29.447
How is she?

59:29.982 --> 59:31.176
Scared.

59:31.350 --> 59:33.511
Yeah, well, she should be.

59:35.253 --> 59:36.515
Who are they?

59:36.688 --> 59:40.624
To the left, the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

59:41.326 --> 59:43.226
To the right...

59:43.395 --> 59:45.260
...the bikers work for Gorsky.

59:51.003 --> 59:54.302
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

59:54.806 --> 59:56.831
And if we don't?

01:00:00.312 --> 01:00:02.303
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

01:00:05.317 --> 01:00:07.308
Look, Sister.

01:00:07.853 --> 01:00:10.686
We traveled 6000 miles together.

01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:14.348
The truth is this has been
a suicide mission from the beginning.

01:00:14.526 --> 01:00:17.359
They won't let either one of us
walk out of here alive.

01:00:19.197 --> 01:00:23.497
That's the doctor that came
to the convent three months ago.

01:00:23.669 --> 01:00:26.297
Answer the door.
Act like nothing's wrong.

01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:29.833
Okay.

01:00:38.016 --> 01:00:41.179
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

01:00:45.524 --> 01:00:47.424
Good evening.

01:00:47.592 --> 01:00:49.059
Where is she?

01:00:49.227 --> 01:00:50.922
In the room.

01:01:12.617 --> 01:01:14.380
You're a bad man.

01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:27.163
Thank you, Aurora.
Thank you so much.

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:47.145
- How is she?
- She's fine.

01:01:47.319 --> 01:01:48.786
I have to run some more tests.

01:01:48.954 --> 01:01:50.148
- More tests?
- Standard...

01:01:50.322 --> 01:01:51.619
You just ran your test.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:53.985
- What's wrong with her?
- Expect a call.

01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:56.821
What is wrong with her?

01:01:56.995 --> 01:01:58.326
Toorop.

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:01.625
Toorop, let him go.

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:04.625
If you please?

01:02:06.905 --> 01:02:09.032
Thank you, Sister.

01:02:16.414 --> 01:02:18.211
- Get over here.
- What's wrong with you?

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.713
I wanna know everything.

01:02:19.918 --> 01:02:24.014
Don't you think that if I knew anything,
I would tell you?

01:02:24.189 --> 01:02:25.781
No, I don't think.

01:02:25.957 --> 01:02:29.393
You're a Noelite. You are like him.
You swore an oath.

01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:31.654
Not to them. To God.

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:34.230
God has nothing to do with it now.

01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:35.558
You understand?

01:02:35.734 --> 01:02:38.532
If she carries a virus,
she could annihilate the city.

01:02:38.703 --> 01:02:40.694
I'm not gonna have it on my conscience.

01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:53.044
I'm pregnant. Twins.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.653
It's not possible.

01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:59.586
I've watched over you all your life.

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:02.022
No one's ever touched you.

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:08.195
- And nobody has.
- It's a miracle.

01:03:10.101 --> 01:03:11.864
Shit.

01:03:14.206 --> 01:03:18.575
- Hello.
<i>- Mr. Toorop, this is the High Priestess.</i>

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:20.506
<i>- I am the...</i>
- I know who you are.

01:03:20.679 --> 01:03:24.513
<i>Thank you for doing such a good job,</i>
<i>Mr. Toorop.</i>

01:03:24.683 --> 01:03:25.707
You're welcome.

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:28.045
<i>Bring the girl to the limousine</i>
<i>and you'll be free...</i>

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.448
- Toorop...
<i>...and rich.</i>

01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:32.988
...if you deliver me to them, I'll die.

01:03:38.997 --> 01:03:40.487
We're on our way out.

01:03:44.302 --> 01:03:48.398
<i>All right, guys.</i>
<i>Let's go get her. Are you ready?</i>

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:12.387
We can't let her go, Toorop.

01:04:12.564 --> 01:04:15.294
Look around. Do we have a choice?

01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:21.934
She's your problem now.

01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:34.947
Move!

01:04:53.438 --> 01:04:54.928
We're going to the subway.

01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:57.097
Thank you, Toorop.

01:05:10.956 --> 01:05:12.116
What's wrong?

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.451
It's a missile linked to my passport.

01:05:15.894 --> 01:05:17.885
How can you stop it?

01:05:18.363 --> 01:05:19.728
- I got him!
- Only by death.

01:05:23.468 --> 01:05:25.299
Go to the subway.

01:05:44.122 --> 01:05:45.680
Toorop.

01:05:53.865 --> 01:05:54.889
Aurora.

01:05:57.736 --> 01:05:59.260
Get the girl.

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.940
It's you.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.216
Protect them.

01:07:40.672 --> 01:07:42.230
I need you to live.

01:08:10.568 --> 01:08:12.798
Aurora was our miracle.

01:08:12.971 --> 01:08:15.201
A true virgin birth.

01:08:15.373 --> 01:08:19.309
This was to make ours
the dominant religion on earth.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.377
Now we don't know
what's happened to her.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:25.880
In this mess,
there's no sign of Aurora.

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:28.381
We can't find her.

01:08:29.087 --> 01:08:32.420
We were finally on the verge
of becoming a bona fide religion.

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:37.050
Your incompetence has thrown 20 years
of careful planning down the tubes.

01:08:37.228 --> 01:08:39.492
Who gave the order to use guns
to retrieve her?

01:08:39.663 --> 01:08:41.426
You left Gorsky no choice.

01:08:41.599 --> 01:08:43.294
What were you thinking?

01:08:44.402 --> 01:08:47.029
- Your Highness.
- What?

01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:49.366
The body stolen from the morgue
was Toorop's.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:52.669
The police have found the van
that transported him to New Jersey.

01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:57.309
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

01:09:06.524 --> 01:09:08.719
He's back online.

01:09:18.736 --> 01:09:20.397
Where are you taking me?

01:09:20.572 --> 01:09:22.596
To Darquandier.

01:09:38.555 --> 01:09:42.754
Jamal, Mr. Toorop is not our prisoner.
You can release him.

01:09:46.764 --> 01:09:48.390
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.

01:09:48.566 --> 01:09:51.899
I'm Dr. Darquandier. Aurora's father.

01:09:55.807 --> 01:09:57.274
I thought you were dead.

01:09:57.442 --> 01:10:01.071
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

01:10:01.246 --> 01:10:02.270
You'll see.

01:10:03.948 --> 01:10:07.008
Oh, yes. You we're clinically dead
for two hours.

01:10:07.185 --> 01:10:09.449
We lost time
getting you from the morgue.

01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:11.782
And then you went into a coma
for five days.

01:10:11.956 --> 01:10:15.119
I fixed you up as best I could.

01:10:15.927 --> 01:10:19.590
Now, Mr. Toorop, I believe
I owe you some explanation.

01:10:22.033 --> 01:10:25.298
Twenty years ago, I was drummed out
of the medical profession...

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:28.769
...for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

01:10:29.307 --> 01:10:31.366
Around that time,
the Noelites came to me...

01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:35.273
...to create smarter,
stronger, healthier human beings.

01:10:35.446 --> 01:10:41.385
So I built a super computer
to be Aurora's artificial mother.

01:10:41.552 --> 01:10:46.319
As a fetus, Aurora learned
to process information...

01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:48.925
...just like a computer.

01:10:49.927 --> 01:10:52.054
But when she was born...

01:10:52.297 --> 01:10:54.697
...she became much more
than just an experiment.

01:10:54.866 --> 01:10:56.356
She became...

01:10:57.068 --> 01:10:59.866
She became my daughter.
She was beautiful. She was unique.

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:03.906
I couldn't give her away, so that's when
they hired Gorsky to kill me...

01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:07.977
...and, well, he almost succeeded.

01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:12.310
He took my baby away
and hid her for the Noelites.

01:11:12.483 --> 01:11:14.576
I searched for her,
but I couldn't find her.

01:11:14.752 --> 01:11:17.744
I knew that one day the Noelites
would present their miracle...

01:11:17.955 --> 01:11:19.320
...to the rest of the world.

01:11:25.096 --> 01:11:28.224
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

01:11:28.399 --> 01:11:31.197
We think she's alive
and that she's left you a message.

01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:33.667
You died with your eyes open...

01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:36.898
...but your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:39.100
We just need to rewind the tape.

01:11:39.277 --> 01:11:43.338
You need to return to the same condition
you were in when we found you.

01:11:45.216 --> 01:11:46.376
I was dead.

01:11:48.286 --> 01:11:49.878
Quite.

01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:56.526
What am I looking for?

01:11:56.694 --> 01:11:59.026
What you missed the first time.

01:11:59.397 --> 01:12:01.922
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

01:12:03.134 --> 01:12:04.931
Are you ready, Mr. Toorop?

01:12:20.818 --> 01:12:22.149
Stay with the memory.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.288
Stay with the memory.
Move forward a bit.

01:12:28.393 --> 01:12:30.384
Focus on his memories of Aurora.

01:12:31.896 --> 01:12:33.329
He's seeing her. Very good.

01:12:33.531 --> 01:12:34.793
Stop!

01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:37.329
I'll die.

01:12:37.502 --> 01:12:40.062
That's right. We're getting there.
We're getting there.

01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:44.241
Now is good. Focus on his gun.

01:12:51.249 --> 01:12:53.342
Easy, easy. Steady, steady.

01:12:58.322 --> 01:13:01.951
- Way past the danger threshold.
- I know, but he'll be fine. He'll be fine.

01:13:05.663 --> 01:13:08.131
Hey, slow down. Slow down.
Now. Slow down.

01:13:11.836 --> 01:13:13.963
Let's wait, let's wait, let's wait.

01:13:20.578 --> 01:13:22.944
I need you to live.

01:13:38.329 --> 01:13:39.819
He's dead.

01:13:40.298 --> 01:13:41.788
Wait.

01:13:42.133 --> 01:13:43.327
Don't bring him back yet.

01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:46.470
He's almost there. The last seconds.

01:14:07.492 --> 01:14:11.019
Go home.

01:14:14.365 --> 01:14:16.492
It's all right. You're back. You're safe.

01:14:16.667 --> 01:14:18.658
You're all right. You're fine.

01:14:18.836 --> 01:14:21.031
I know where she is.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.373
Mr. Gorsky, I hoped
I wouldn't have to see you again.

01:14:26.544 --> 01:14:28.375
<i>Where is my money?</i>
<i>You haven't paid me.</i>

01:14:28.546 --> 01:14:30.912
You have an odd way
of killing people.

01:14:31.082 --> 01:14:32.549
What are you talking about?

01:14:32.717 --> 01:14:35.709
I'm on my way
to see our old friend, Darquandier.

01:14:35.887 --> 01:14:39.015
Impossible.
I made his car explode myself.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:42.057
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill, I kill for good.

01:14:42.226 --> 01:14:44.387
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

01:14:44.562 --> 01:14:47.087
You will need a nuke to kill me.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:50.758
Bitch.

01:14:53.671 --> 01:14:55.764
How did she survive the blast?

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.534
It's the babies, you see.

01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:01.071
They're gaining power.

01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:03.679
They're the ones guiding her.

01:15:04.382 --> 01:15:08.250
Her capacity for survival is greater than
anything we could ever have imagined.

01:15:08.419 --> 01:15:12.412
Professor, your wife has found us.
She'll be here in two minutes.

01:15:13.257 --> 01:15:14.485
Find her, Toorop.

01:15:14.692 --> 01:15:17.286
You're the only one
who can save her now.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.763
So where are we going?

01:15:24.936 --> 01:15:25.994
North.

01:15:45.122 --> 01:15:46.453
Hello, my dear.

01:15:46.624 --> 01:15:48.251
It's lovely to see you.

01:15:48.426 --> 01:15:51.224
- Where's my daughter?
- I see you haven't found her.

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:53.592
And you never will.

01:15:53.764 --> 01:15:55.664
You selfish bastard.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:59.132
Twenty years ago,
I gave you the opportunity you wanted.

01:15:59.303 --> 01:16:01.237
Now it's my moment.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.433
Where is my daughter?

01:16:04.609 --> 01:16:05.837
She's not your daughter.

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.170
She comes from me.

01:16:07.345 --> 01:16:09.643
- I designed her.
- For me.

01:16:10.014 --> 01:16:11.709
She's my miracle.

01:16:11.882 --> 01:16:14.851
- She belongs to my church.
- Your church is a lie.

01:16:15.019 --> 01:16:17.988
You're peddling miracles
for your own profit.

01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:25.995
Are you willing to die for her?

01:16:26.163 --> 01:16:27.323
Yes.

01:16:38.175 --> 01:16:41.269
Find Toorop. He knows where she is.

01:17:16.047 --> 01:17:17.810
Wait here.

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:54.074
You're finally home.

01:17:55.086 --> 01:17:57.077
What's left of it.

01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:02.615
But I came back for you.

01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:07.425
Have a little faith.

01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:49.900
Toorop, they're coming.

01:18:52.143 --> 01:18:53.701
Break left.

01:19:52.169 --> 01:19:54.194
Toorop, they need help.

01:19:55.606 --> 01:19:57.267
No!

01:20:07.251 --> 01:20:09.082
Take the wheel.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.354
Toorop.

01:21:38.876 --> 01:21:40.639
Thank you.

01:21:41.979 --> 01:21:44.140
For protecting us.

01:21:51.522 --> 01:21:54.116
You're their father now.

01:22:07.204 --> 01:22:09.001
Aurora.

01:22:11.308 --> 01:22:16.143
That's the first time
you've said my name.

01:22:17.481 --> 01:22:19.847
You're gonna be okay.

01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:25.345
Take care of them, Toorop.

01:22:37.668 --> 01:22:39.636
Hey, kids.

01:22:42.072 --> 01:22:45.041
There's a storm coming.
We need to go.

01:22:53.517 --> 01:22:55.007
Ready?

01:22:55.185 --> 01:22:56.948
Okay, Dad.
