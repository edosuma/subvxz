THE MASK OF THE HUNTSGIRL.

03:05.451 --> 03:09.055
GUYS, I THINK IT WAS MORE
THAN A DREAM. I THINK...

03:09.055 --> 03:13.059
I THINK ROSE IS TRYING
TO CONTACT ME

03:13.059 --> 03:18.064
UH, JAKE, YOU SURE
THERE'S NOT SOME EXPLANATION

03:18.064 --> 03:21.100
THAT'S A LITTLE LESS,
I DON'T KNOW, CRA-ZAZY?

03:21.100 --> 03:23.770
WELL, THERE ARE SPELLS
YOU CAN USE TO ENTER
PEOPLE'S DREAMS.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.106
I USE 'EM ALL THE TIME
TO AVOID PAYING
LONG-DISTANCE CHARGES.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.007
BLUESKI.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.310
MAYBE I CAN USE
THE SAME KIND OF SPELL

03:30.310 --> 03:32.045
TO ENTER HER DREAMS
AND FIND OUT--

03:32.045 --> 03:34.480
NO, JAKE.
IT MAY BE A TRAP.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.748
MM-HMM.
NO DOUBT.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.017
I'M TELLING Y'ALL
ROSE IS BAD NEWS.

03:38.017 --> 03:42.488
IT IS BEST TO PROCEED
WITH CAUTION.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.792
YOU REALLY MISS HER,
DON'T YOU, KID?

03:45.792 --> 03:47.193
IT'S BEEN 3 MONTHS, FU.

03:47.193 --> 03:50.396
I THOUGHT I'D BE OVER HER
BY NOW, BUT I'M NOT.

03:50.396 --> 03:54.767
I JUST...
I NEED TO KNOW SHE'S OK.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.135
DAH.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.905
OK. THE OLD MAN'S
GONNA HATE ME FOR THIS,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.040
BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT FINDING HER,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.409
I THINK I KNOW A SPELL
THAT'LL DO IT.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.011
FU, THAT'S AWESOME.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.413
YOU'RE MY DOG.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.782
AND I MEAN THAT
IN A HIP-HOP WAY,

04:09.782 --> 04:14.020
EASY, KID. I'M STILL
RECOVERING FROM OUR
EARLY SMOOCH SESSION

04:14.020 --> 04:15.822
WITH THE NASTY
MORNING BREATH.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.390
SO WHAT ARE
WE TALKING HERE?

04:17.390 --> 04:20.192
A PORTAL SPELL.
IT'S PRETTY TRICKY.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.896
IT'LL OPEN A DIMENSIONAL DOOR
TO WHEREVER ROSE IS.

04:23.896 --> 04:29.235
ONE PROBLEM. I'M MISSING
A KEY INGREDIENT--KRYLOCK VENOM.

04:29.235 --> 04:32.305
KRYLOCK. A BEAST
OF PURE EVIL

04:32.305 --> 04:33.906
THAT FEEDS OFF
OF MAGICAL CREATURES.

04:33.906 --> 04:37.243
IT HAS THE HEAD OF A COBRA
AND THE BODY OF A SCORPION.

04:37.243 --> 04:40.146
AW, HE'S NOT EVIL.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.048
HE'S JUST MISUNDERSTOOD--

04:42.048 --> 04:43.950
AAH! AAH! HE'S EVIL!

04:43.950 --> 04:46.219
OK, SO LET'S GO FIND
THIS KRY THING ALREADY.

04:46.219 --> 04:50.123
THAT'S THE HITCH, KID.
OUR GUY'S INTERDIMENSIONAL.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.894
THE ONLY WAY
IT CAN ENTER OUR WORLD IS
THROUGH A DIMENSIONAL DOOR

04:54.894 --> 04:57.463
WHICH CAN POP UP
ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.365
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO TRACK.

04:59.365 --> 05:03.136
WE WAIT FOR IT
TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE
IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.973
WHEN IT DOES,
THAT'S WHEN WE STRIKE.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.978
UH, JAKEY, IF FU
TOLD US TO WAIT,

05:11.978 --> 05:14.047
HOW COME WE

05:14.047 --> 05:16.049
TRYING TO FIND
THIS KRY BEAST THINGY?

05:16.049 --> 05:20.253
THE SOONER WE FIND IT,
THE SOONER I FIND ROSE.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.088
[SIGHS] OK.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.256
BUT I'M WARNING YOU.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.991
AROUND 2 A.M.
TRIXIE'S BREATH

05:24.991 --> 05:29.529
STARTED TO SMELL LIKE
A TRUCK STOP IN SKAGSVILLE.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.233
IN A GOOD WAY.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.036
JAKEY, ME AND SPUD,
WE UNDERSTAND

05:37.036 --> 05:38.471
HOW MUCH YOU DIG
ROSE AND ALL,

05:38.471 --> 05:40.373
BUT SHE DISAPPEARED
MONTHS AGO.

05:40.373 --> 05:44.143
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO START MOVING ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.978
MOVE ON?
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT

05:45.978 --> 05:50.917
UH, MAYBE BECAUSE
WE WENT THROUGH
EVERYTHING WITH YOU.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.318
YEAH. LIKE WHEN YOU
WERE CONVINCED

05:52.318 --> 05:56.522
THE HUNTSMAN WAS
HOLDING ROSE HOSTAGE
IN THE HUNTS LAIR.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.359
ROSE, I'M HERE.

06:02.395 --> 06:06.366
I DON'T SUPPOSE
THE EVIL HUNTSCLAN
THAT USED TO LIVE HERE

06:06.366 --> 06:08.167
LEFT A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

06:08.167 --> 06:12.238
Trixie: AND THEN THERE WAS
THAT WHOLE DEPRESSION PHASE.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.574
OH, ROSE,

THAT ONE DAY

06:24.617 --> 06:27.220
WHEN YOU DECIDED
TO JUST GIVE UP ON GIRLS?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.255
YO, BROTHER, WHAT UP?

06:29.255 --> 06:30.356
I'M SORRY, JAKE.

06:30.356 --> 06:34.026
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS GOING TO WORK OUT.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.996
AW! BUT MY HAIRDO RULES!

06:36.996 --> 06:38.998

Spud: YOU'RE
FLUNKING HOME EC?

06:52.979 --> 06:56.349
DUDE, I DIDN'T THINK
MISS PARK EVEN

06:56.349 --> 06:58.418
BRAD BLEW UP
A POT ROAST LAST WEEK

06:58.418 --> 07:00.219
AND ALL HE GOT
WAS A FROWNY FACE.

07:00.219 --> 07:05.124
THE BRADSTER MAKES

07:05.124 --> 07:07.093
