WEBVTT

00:07.924 --> 00:09.592
All right, all right.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.760
Let me show you girls
how it's really done, okay?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.137
Go ahead.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.270
Will you go?

00:20.270 --> 00:22.147
Uh, you messed up
my concentration,

00:22.147 --> 00:23.481
so let me start over.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.774
Recess is almost over.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.317
School is almost over.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.777
Okay, maybe if you guys
weren't double-handed.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.154
Maybe it's not me.
Maybe it's you.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.363
All right, here we go.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.784
Ah!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.244
Jacob, that was my turn.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.621
Down by the river
where the green grass grows,

00:38.705 --> 00:40.707
there sat Janine
sweet as a rose.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.252
Along came Jacob,
doing double dutch.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.796
Janine's on the sidelines.
Jealous much?

00:46.880 --> 00:50.717
Wow. I'm good. Huh.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.482
Okay, we're all set.
The food's been ordered.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.359
It's gonna get here right
in time for the Open House.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.818
All right.
And if we really

01:08.902 --> 01:10.403
want to get crazy, I've got
my travel Scrabble.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.988
I always keep it
on my person.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.281
Are we gonna have to
spend time

01:13.365 --> 01:14.532
talking to the parents
at the Open House?

01:15.867 --> 01:18.495
I forgot -- this is
your first Open House.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.746
Oh!

01:19.746 --> 01:20.955
Oh, he's so young.
It's adorable.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.959
I mean, old and dignified.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.797
Today, after school, we have
our annual Open House.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.882
Parents and anyone
in the neighborhood

01:30.882 --> 01:32.384
are invited to attend.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.512
But people in this community
are busy working,

01:35.512 --> 01:36.888
or they just don't show up.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.141
You taking the bar?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.518
What's with all the studying?

01:41.518 --> 01:43.895
Oh, this is a make-or-break
Open House for me.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.481
If you don't make yourself
relax, you will break.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.191
Hardly anybody ever comes.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.235
No, I know.
I just have this student, Nina,

01:50.235 --> 01:51.653
and she's been struggling,

01:51.653 --> 01:52.987
and I haven't been able
to connect with her mom,

01:53.071 --> 01:54.364
and this is my one chance
to talk to her

01:54.364 --> 01:55.490
because she promised
she'll be here tonight,

01:55.490 --> 01:56.950
so it has to go perfect.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.992
What's your resting heart rate?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.452
- Around 75.
- Mm.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.954
What are you, a hummingbird?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.248
No, it's just -- I know
what it's like to be a child

02:03.248 --> 02:06.334
at one of those pivotal moments,
and, uh...

02:06.418 --> 02:08.837
You know,
parents should be involved.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.714
But what are you afraid
she's gonna end up like?

02:10.714 --> 02:13.425
<i>♪ I got the sounds for your
ass, and it's easy to see ♪</i>

02:13.425 --> 02:15.927
<i>♪ That this DJ be Ava C! ♪</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:18.179
I'm DJ'ing the Open House!

02:18.263 --> 02:19.848
DJ A-V-A!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.183
Whatever.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.560
The superintendent
is coming.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.770
Don't you think you should
act more like...

02:25.854 --> 02:27.397
you know, a...principal?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
Yeah, well,
if the superintendent

02:28.857 --> 02:30.608
has notes for me,
I got a note for him --

02:30.692 --> 02:32.068
don't let me catch you
cheating on your wife.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.612
What are you talking about?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.322
Oh, you don't know?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.992
I caught him with the Deaconess.
That's how I got this job.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.035
He thought he could get away
with a thot,

02:40.035 --> 02:41.077
but he thought wrong.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.662
That's a tongue twister.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.955
Wait. Are you saying --

02:44.039 --> 02:45.165
That that man
is in my pocket

02:45.165 --> 02:46.416
- like Jay-
- Z after the elevator.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.501
I'ma go set up.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.003
Y'all got any requests,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.379
ask your mama,
'cause I don't take requests.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.299
I applied
for the principal job here.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.967
I studied for it.
I majored in it.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.260
I did everything right,

02:57.344 --> 03:00.263
but I didn't get the job
because Ava...

03:00.347 --> 03:02.891
blackmailed the superintendent!

03:09.272 --> 03:12.317
I'm not sure
when Nina's mom is coming, uh,

03:12.317 --> 03:13.943
but I'm starting to get
a little anxious.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.653
This has to go well.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.365
So, just in case,
I'm gonna go see Barbara

03:18.365 --> 03:20.575
to rehearse what I have to say.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.077
Barbara is my mentor.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.245
And you know what?
She's kind of like my mom.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.081
She's my momtor.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.209
Hey, Barbara.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.960
There you are.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.130
I have been looking forward
to seeing you all day.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.924
Wow. This is my dream.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.551
Oh.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.178
Mm!

03:42.013 --> 03:45.100
- Nope. Hugs -- parties of two.
- Oh!

03:45.100 --> 03:47.477
Um, Janine, I'd like you to meet
my daughter.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.856
Hi. I'm Taylor.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.108
Oh, Janine teaches
the second grade,

03:53.108 --> 03:55.360
and the kids
absolutely love her.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.696
Mm.
Yeah, wow.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.156
It's so nice to meet you.
You're so lucky.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.199
Your mom is a saint.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.201
So I've heard.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.703
Taylor's visiting
from New York,

04:04.703 --> 04:09.374
and since Open House is usually
so long and sparsely attended,

04:09.374 --> 04:11.459
I invited her
to keep me company.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.629
Oh, wow! New York.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.131
You know,
last time I was there,

04:16.131 --> 04:19.467
I was shopping on Canal Street,
and I see this huge rat.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.594
So I pull out my phone
to take a picture of it,

04:21.678 --> 04:22.762
but then this flying
piece of garbage

04:22.846 --> 04:24.180
just smacks me in the face,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.182
so dropped my phone,
went in the gutter,

04:26.266 --> 04:28.018
never saw it again.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.229
Wow.
That story had everything.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.732
Man, this is so cool
'cause, you know,

04:33.732 --> 04:36.568
you're Barbara's blood daughter,
and I'm her work daughter.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.403
- Uh, her work daughter?
- Yep.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.281
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.
You're not jealous, are you?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.033
Because you got all the perks.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.410
- So many perks.
- Yeah, shopping trips,

04:45.410 --> 04:47.495
boy talks, period talks.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.080
Those must have been moving.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.041
I wish I could've gotten one
from my mom or even Barbara.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.626
So why don't we just take a look
at some of the children's art?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.338
- Yeah.
- Oh, I can't even imagine having

04:56.338 --> 04:58.006
a mom like Barbara.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.632
I used to do this thing
with my mom

04:59.716 --> 05:02.260
where I would say to her
exactly what I wanted to hear,

05:02.344 --> 05:03.845
hoping she would
just say it back,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.931
and she'd just keep playing
my Game Boy, so...

05:08.183 --> 05:09.517
Hey, Jacob.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.561
What are you doing?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.606
Oh, me? I'm...
just admiring Mr. Dewey

05:14.606 --> 05:17.359
and his undefeated
decimal system.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.943
Come over here.
Play some poker.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.570
I've never really played.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.782
Even better.
You got 20 bucks?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.200
Well, you know what?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.451
Might be worth it
to lose a little money

05:26.451 --> 05:28.036
for the conversation
and camaraderie.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.621
Yeah, whatever.
Mr. J!

05:29.621 --> 05:32.082
Come on. It's time.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.167
Hey, it's me, Mr. Johnson.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.294
I look different
in my after-work clothes.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.463
- You got him to play?
- Mm-hmm.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.673
I think I'll be okay.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.424
You know, I --
I've dabbled in Uno.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.759
Yeah, see?
He dabbled in Uno.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.678
Listen, this is a nice,
friendly game.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.596
You got nothing to worry about.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.848
- Well, wonderful.
- Sit your ass down.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.435
Papa's getting
a new set of brooms!

05:53.812 --> 05:56.314
<i>Principal A-A-Ava, son!</i>

05:56.398 --> 05:57.732
<i>Another one!</i>

05:57.816 --> 06:00.652
Check out this oldie but goodie
by my guy Ginuwine!

06:00.652 --> 06:01.986
It's called "Pony," y'all!

06:02.070 --> 06:03.822
And he ain't talking
about a horse!

06:05.073 --> 06:07.409
Superintendent Collins,
you showed.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.494
Just stopping by
for a quick tour.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.080
Well, if you want to waste
your time, fine by me.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.123
But you know
if you got a problem,

06:13.123 --> 06:14.207
there's nothing
you can do about it.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.834
It's my job to be here.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.169
Well, I wouldn't want to
cheat you out of a tour.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.380
I say that 'cause
you cheated on your wife.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.507
I got it the first time.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.925
Let me put on
some Toni Braxton.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.428
You'll like this one.
It's called...

06:26.428 --> 06:28.888
"Love Shoulda
Brought You Home"!

06:28.972 --> 06:30.640
<i>♪ I promise that
you won't want to...</i> ♪

06:30.724 --> 06:32.517
How about I take you to dinner
after this?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.769
Take me?
I'm taking you.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.271
Where do you want to go?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.940
- I heard --
- I heard Burrata's really good.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.776
Yeah. Tariq always says
he's gonna take me there

06:41.860 --> 06:43.069
when he signs a record deal,

06:43.153 --> 06:44.404
but he hasn't been
offered one yet,

06:44.404 --> 06:45.864
so I'm just holding off
on reservations.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.240
Okay.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.743
Well, we'll take that
under consideration.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.077
- Maybe we could --
- You know, I know lots of

06:51.161 --> 06:53.830
special places I haven't
been to yet,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.915
so don't be afraid to ask.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.918
And, Taylor, I don't know
how long you're gonna be here,

06:59.002 --> 07:00.462
but I would love to
show you around Philly.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.504
Oh, that's okay.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.589
- I grew up here.
- Oh.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.965
I'm really just here
to see my mom.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.425
She's also here for work.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.551
I'm here to see you.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.386
But you're also here
for work.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.263
I mean, that's usually
when you visit, right?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.724
Well, your mom is amazing.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.601
In fact, the reason I'm here
is to, you know,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.102
ask you about a conversation
I have to have later

07:16.186 --> 07:17.604
- with a parent --
- Mom, I'm here.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.564
What difference does it make
if I also have to work?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.691
But, sweetheart,
there is a difference.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.902
Well, so what do you do, Taylor?

07:23.902 --> 07:26.905
I represent a global brand.
We promote friendship and fun --

07:26.905 --> 07:28.698
She sells booze.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.825
I'm a rep for a high-end
alcohol company.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.411
Oh! Oh, I love
high-end alcohol.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.705
I don't drink it,
but I do love the commercials.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.207
The Most Interesting Man
in the World --

07:37.207 --> 07:38.750
he seems interesting to me.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.670
That's for beer. But wait until
you see our spokesman.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.922
- So you know Machine Gun Kelly?
- Oh, my God, yes!

07:43.922 --> 07:45.090
Our guy sounds just like him.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.508
And we just did a deal where if

07:46.508 --> 07:48.093
the Sixers win the NBA Finals,

07:48.093 --> 07:50.095
they're gonna pour our spirits
on themselves.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.138
- Oh, wow! That is huge.
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.100
The only spirit I recognize
is the Spirit of the Lord.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.559
Here we go again.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.770
I'm just saying,
with your gifts,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.355
you could be helping people.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.690
You don't need to
"just say" that, Mom.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.149
Well, I feel like I do.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.859
See, this is the kind of
open dialogue

08:04.943 --> 08:07.362
that I'm hoping to have
with this parent later --

08:07.362 --> 08:09.364
Well, I'm sorry we can't
all be Saint Barbara.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.074
Well, I wasn't saying
she was like a saint, saint.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.618
She hasn't been recognized
by the church, I don't think.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.871
All that education.
You could be doing so much more.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.123
Like teaching, right?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.374
Well...yes.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.959
There it is!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.794
Just because I didn't make
the same life choices you made,

08:22.794 --> 08:24.129
you can't support me.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.463
- That is not true.
- Well, that's not true.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.132
It is true.
You wanted me to be someone

08:27.132 --> 08:29.009
who dedicates their life
to children

08:29.009 --> 08:31.302
and can't afford a nice car
or a mortgage

08:31.386 --> 08:33.221
and dresses like Mr. Rogers.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.724
- Oh! Dig on me.
- Yes.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.643
Because, ultimately, she just
wants me to be someone like you.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.277
So..now is probably not
a good time

08:47.277 --> 08:48.695
to talk about
the parent-teacher con--

08:48.695 --> 08:51.656
- No.
- Okay. Right.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.209
Barbara...

09:03.293 --> 09:04.919
It's okay, Janine.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.089
Taylor and I have had
that conversation...

09:08.173 --> 09:09.257
many times.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.508
Oh.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.178
Well, I hope it works out.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.764
Um...although I am flattered

09:15.764 --> 09:18.433
that you wanted your daughter
to be like me.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.352
Janine, this is
none of your concern.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.687
I know that you have
a very important conversation

09:22.771 --> 09:24.230
coming up with a parent,

09:24.314 --> 09:27.275
so why don't you go
and prepare for that, huh?

09:29.152 --> 09:31.196
- Good idea.
- Yes.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.698
But if you did want me to make
that reservation at Burrata,

09:33.782 --> 09:35.533
I could do that
for the three of us.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.202
Or just the two of us?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.954
I'm leaving.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
Okay, I'm back. Had to show
a couple of parents...

09:43.083 --> 09:44.292
how to get
to another school.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.627
They were in
the wrong place.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.129
Oh, sorry, Mr. Johnson,
I gotta do that.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.714
Last time I trusted
someone else to shuffle,

09:49.798 --> 09:51.424
I lost a kidney.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.926
I am all-in.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.719
She hasn't even
dealt the cards yet.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.514
Yeah, I meant emotionally.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.102
I fold.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.605
I don't want to get my hopes up.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.693
Is that Gregory?

10:10.360 --> 10:13.488
Did he look, like, disheveled?

10:13.488 --> 10:15.031
Normally, I do these
standing up,

10:15.115 --> 10:18.451
but I realized something --
nothing matters.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.036
Okay? Why try?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.496
I mean, I tried for
the principal job, and for what?

10:21.496 --> 10:22.914
You know, what was the point?

10:22.914 --> 10:25.208
I mean, what's the point
of anything, really?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.293
Oh, yeah,
I loosened my tie, yeah.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.796
I mean, why even
sit up straight, you know?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.798
I like this. It feels better.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.012
Why do people sit like that?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.600
Oh, hey!
Are you Nina's mom?

10:42.684 --> 10:44.019
No, I'm Jamar's mom.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.311
- Oh, dang it.
- What?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.771
Why?
Is Jamar doing okay?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.356
- Is he falling behind?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

10:48.440 --> 10:50.233
He's perfect. Um...

10:50.233 --> 10:52.027
Why don't you take a look
at the art wall,

10:52.027 --> 10:53.820
and I'll be with you
in a second.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.946
Have a cookie --
they're homemade

10:55.030 --> 10:56.364
from the grocery store.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.539
<i>If you're calling about it,</i>

11:04.539 --> 11:05.832
<i>I probably don't have time
for it.</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:07.083
- <i>-
- Leave one.</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:08.334
Hey, Mrs. Williams.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.754
This is Ms. Teagues,
Nina's teacher.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.548
Um, you said that you would be
at the Open House tonight,

11:13.548 --> 11:16.926
and FYI, we close
at 8:00 sharp.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.511
So, see ya soon!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.305
Okay.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.143
Uh...hi?

11:25.143 --> 11:26.353
Sup?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.688
I'm Taylor.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.357
Greg.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.650
I'm the not principal
of Abbott Elementary.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.527
What a coincidence.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.154
I'm not the principal, either.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.239
Well, we have that
in common.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.368
- You a parent?
- No. My parent works here.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.535
And she never lets you
forget it.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.329
Oh. Yeah,
you're Barbara's daughter.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.455
From New York, right?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.540
Yep. It's the best.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.501
I mean, it can be
stressful, but --

11:49.501 --> 11:51.711
I don't know anything
about stress.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.255
Nickname's Easy Going Greg.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.051
What's up, Barb?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.098
Hello, Mrs. Howard.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.935
Taylor, can I talk with you,
please?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.868
Mother-daughter
relationships can be tricky.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.413
No one knows that more than me.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.165
There isn't anything I can do
about Nina's mom not showing up,

12:29.249 --> 12:32.419
but there is something I can do
about Barbara and Taylor.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.878
I can help them fix things.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.256
I'm probably the only one
that can.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.428
Oh.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.850
I love you,
and I am proud of you,

12:46.850 --> 12:50.228
and I will always
be there for you.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.855
Oh!

12:51.855 --> 12:55.316
Oh. Oh.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.027
Oh!

12:59.029 --> 13:00.822
Oops!
Power surge.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.242
Uh, I was trying to leave
quietly without you seeing me,

13:04.242 --> 13:06.077
but then you couldn't
see anything,

13:06.161 --> 13:07.829
and now you can.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.790
So... I am going to go.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.585
You guys keep hugging.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.503
Okay.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.965
Thinking about turning that
into my wo-man cave.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.092
My Lady Lair.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.595
Somewhere I can take naps
and watch <i>Housewives.</i>

13:23.595 --> 13:25.513
Do you think I could fit
a Jacuzzi in there?

13:25.597 --> 13:27.515
Do you think you should be
doing that on school grounds?

13:27.599 --> 13:29.476
Do you think you should be doing
what you did on church grounds?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.732
Hey! Superintendent Collins.
You remember me?

13:35.732 --> 13:36.983
- Gregory Eddie.
- Mm.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.318
Of course.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.652
You gave a really good interview.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.363
I thought so, yeah.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.572
You interviewed
for this job?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.199
Oh, damn! What happened?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.243
It's hard to say.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.579
But you made the right choice
here with Ava.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.247
I don't even know
how to DJ, so...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.832
Why you being all weird?

13:52.916 --> 13:54.000
I like you better
when you're stoic.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.210
Keep the mystery, boo.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.922
Great hire. Well-deserved.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.299
Really, really well-deserved.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.889
Another Ava super-fan.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.750
- Hey, I'm --
- Nina's mom, yeah.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.794
The Open House closed at 8:00.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.963
It's 8:30, so, no, sorry,
you missed it.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.798
- I know, but --
- No buts.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.718
I've been trying to get you
in this classroom all year.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.011
You had plenty of time
to get here.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.304
- If you'll let me exp--
- I'm tired of excuses.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.473
You weren't here
when you said you would be.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.018
Your kid's having trouble,
and are you there for them?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.477
No. You're doing
whatever you want

14:54.561 --> 14:56.062
because the whole world
revolves around you.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.981
- But --
- Just be there for your kid.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.399
It's not fair
that they have to be

14:59.399 --> 15:01.151
more of a grown-up
than you are,

15:01.151 --> 15:02.527
and the only time
you reach out

15:02.527 --> 15:05.196
is when you ask for
a Disney+ login.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.240
Um, I have my own login.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.659
And I was stuck in the E.R.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.911
There was a guy
with a bullet in his groin,

15:11.995 --> 15:13.830
and I thought it'd be
a good idea to stick around

15:13.830 --> 15:15.165
and help him get it out.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.958
Is that okay with you?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.838
Yeah, yeah. No, that's okay.
That's fine with me.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.592
I'm just, again, really sorry
for what I said.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.510
It wasn't about you.
It was about me.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.304
- I understand.
- Just had some

15:29.304 --> 15:31.556
experience with parents
who aren't really there

15:31.556 --> 15:32.766
when their kids need them to be.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.351
But, obviously,
that isn't you.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.102
It isn't. I love Nina.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.313
And I'll do whatever it takes
to figure this out.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.242
Okay! Just wait.
I can't let you do this, kid.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.078
Why don't we just say
we're playing for these chips

15:53.078 --> 15:54.120
and not real money?

15:54.204 --> 15:55.872
A bet is a bet.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.540
I gambled away my house,
my car,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.292
and my subscription to
Horse Fancy.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.878
No one ever said,
"That's okay, Mr. Johnson.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.171
It was an honest mistake."

16:03.171 --> 16:05.131
You don't have to treat me
like a kid.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.175
Okay, kid.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.304
But you shoulda
listened to me.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.722
Read 'em and weep!

16:13.640 --> 16:16.601
Not surprised.
My cards are trash.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.437
- Whoo!
- Oh. Darn it!

16:19.521 --> 16:21.231
I just have
the same four cards.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.567
Are you frickin' kidding me?

16:24.651 --> 16:27.153
Does that mean
I get all the chips?

16:28.697 --> 16:30.490
- What was that?
- What was what?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.742
That right there --
that -- that smirk.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.369
Yeah, he's definitely besmirked.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.162
You've played poker before,
haven't you?

16:37.622 --> 16:38.873
All right, you hustled me.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.000
Sorry. Yeah.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.919
I'm actually
really good at poker.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.629
When I did
Teachers Without Borders,

16:44.713 --> 16:45.922
we had a lot of free time,

16:46.006 --> 16:47.674
so we basically
would just play cards...

16:47.674 --> 16:49.009
and have sex
with each other.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.760
What's the name of
that organization again?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.804
You know what?
I'm not even mad.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.889
I'm impressed.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.099
I mean, I will get
revenge on you,

16:56.099 --> 16:57.308
and you should look
over your shoulder

16:57.392 --> 17:00.437
for the rest of your life,
but...well done.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.024
Not getting
multiplication tables,

17:04.024 --> 17:05.525
difficulty telling time --

17:05.525 --> 17:07.527
they're things that can be
worked on at home

17:07.527 --> 17:09.279
while we continue
to work on them here.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.697
And I won't leave
anyone behind,

17:10.697 --> 17:12.574
but I just need it
to be a group effort.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.285
- I want to work together.
- That's all I'm asking.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.953
You know,
Nina's a smart kid.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.413
Like her mom.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.290
She just needs
some extra attention

17:20.290 --> 17:22.000
from all of us at this stage,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.878
and once she gets that,
she's gonna thrive.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.630
She's so lucky to have you.
Thank you.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.924
Oh. Oh.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.306
I hugged you, but...

17:36.306 --> 17:37.807
now it feels like
you're hugging me.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.560
Yeah. I think I need it.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.940
Victory lap!

17:46.024 --> 17:47.150
Um, you're in a good mood.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.568
Ah, yes!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.653
The mom I was waiting for
finally showed up,

17:50.737 --> 17:54.240
and we had this amazing talk,
and we're gonna work together,

17:54.324 --> 17:55.992
and I really think
it's gonna help.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.244
Hmm.
Well, I'm happy for you.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.746
Thank you.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.248
Why is your posture
not perfect?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.084
You okay?
Something happen to your core?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.668
- My core's fine.
- Oh.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.338
I'm just...
processing some things.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.009
Well, we're going out tonight,

18:13.093 --> 18:14.427
to celebrate
my big teacher win.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.762
You know, I forgot
for a second,

18:15.762 --> 18:18.181
but caring really pays off.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.474
So let's get a drink.

18:19.474 --> 18:23.103
Ah, Janine, I'm sorry.
I can't tonight.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.854
Why not?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.022
You ready, Greg?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.066
- Greg?
- This is, uh, Taylor.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.734
- She's --
- Yeah. Yeah, we met.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.361
Uh, but maybe another time.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.196
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.907
We should go to Burrata.
I hear it's amazing.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.283
All right.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.960
And that concludes
the Total Waste of Time Tour.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.295
So I guess I'll be seeing you
in a couple of weeks

18:49.379 --> 18:50.547
at the school board meeting.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.881
Yes, you will,
and I'll be asking

18:51.965 --> 18:53.216
for extra funding
for next year,

18:53.216 --> 18:55.135
and you will, of course,
give it to me.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.220
Well, I'm not so sure
about that,

18:57.220 --> 19:01.433
because, Ava, that's my wife
come to pick me up.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.476
That's not your wife.
That's the woman that you --

19:03.560 --> 19:05.061
Married?

19:05.145 --> 19:08.023
Yeah, I got divorced
and remarried to the Deaconess.

19:08.023 --> 19:10.567
So all you saw me doing
was kissing my future wife.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.404
But if your presentation
to the school board

19:14.404 --> 19:16.740
is anything like that tour,

19:16.740 --> 19:18.742
you're in a lot of trouble.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.955
You ready, baby?

19:24.622 --> 19:25.790
Hey, Ava!

19:25.874 --> 19:27.167
Do you want to go
celebrate with me?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.877
Girl, you know I can't be seen
in public with you.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.337
Okay, a simple "no"
would be fine.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.922
Damn. I'm gonna miss
being annoyed by you.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.008
Does that mean I'm getting
less annoying, or...?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.926
No, it means
I'm about to get fired.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.444
Maybe they won't be.
Who knows.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.029
I mean, I know,
but I'm hungry.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.031
Have a good night,
and be safe.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.375
Well, looks like your work mom
is free.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.126
How about dinner?

20:12.045 --> 20:14.297
Is this really happening?

20:14.381 --> 20:15.423
Okay, sorry.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.133
Play it cool, Janine.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.927
I would love that.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.221
- Come on.
- Okay.

20:21.221 --> 20:25.225
So, how did the conversation go
with the parent?

20:25.225 --> 20:27.811
Oh, you know what?
Surprisingly well.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.270
I -- I was shocked. Uh...

20:29.354 --> 20:31.523
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.
