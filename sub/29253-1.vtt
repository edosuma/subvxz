03:14.040 --> 03:18.618
Today we have "The Massacre
at Ellsburg Junction."

03:18.620 --> 03:22.513
Come see the wild west back
when it was still wild.

03:25.820 --> 03:26.773
William's boy.

03:27.877 --> 03:28.710
Ma'am.

03:29.987 --> 03:32.448
Now that's a woman I could look up to.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.628
Hell, Willie.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.138
You look up to everything
except snakes, lizards

03:36.140 --> 03:37.798
and fallin' drunks.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.538
Come on ma'am, bring your little boy.

03:56.414 --> 03:59.414
Mister.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.578
Please.

04:02.580 --> 04:04.915
What in blue blazes do
you want Missus Tilghman?

04:04.917 --> 04:05.938
Nothing, just don't curse.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.518
Little ears.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.168
Well just 'cause your
husband's the damn marshal,

04:10.170 --> 04:12.113
don't mean you can boss me.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.058
And as far as I'm concerned,

04:15.060 --> 04:18.012
you and that little britches of yours,

04:18.015 --> 04:19.098
can kiss my...

04:37.010 --> 04:40.013
Please ma'am, we do not
tolerate such behavior.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.593
Oh, Missus Tilghman.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.978
You and your son please
stay for our next show.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.978
I'll just leave sir.

04:47.980 --> 04:52.943
Oh no no no, sometimes
circumstances cause, or make...

04:54.720 --> 04:55.820
Please enjoy our show.

05:11.540 --> 05:14.103
Pepper's out of control again.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.288
Looks like he's done lost his rudder.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.298
Yeah, well you ask me,

05:18.300 --> 05:20.333
he needs his attitude adjusted.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.760
Nice day.

06:14.615 --> 06:17.115
Go on, get out of here, kid.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.023
Pepper.

07:06.789 --> 07:07.622
Pepper.

07:16.950 --> 07:20.413
You're still the best
kisser in this whole town.

07:21.414 --> 07:23.018
Sure.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.983
You kiss better sober.

08:24.130 --> 08:27.268
Where'd you get them pants?

08:27.270 --> 08:29.588
Your mama in the circus?

08:29.590 --> 08:32.403
I sir am a director of moving pictures.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.053
Well I don't see no cameras.

08:38.270 --> 08:41.518
Indeed sir, I tell the
camera what to shoot.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.428
Then you should be good

08:43.429 --> 08:47.518
at tellin' the bartender
that I need some whiskey.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.098
And good stuff, I ain't
used to drinkin' no rotgut.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.598
Excuse me allow me to introduce myself.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.188
Selig, Eagle Film Company.

08:57.190 --> 08:59.008
This is Gulman, our director.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.988
Now, my fine man,

09:00.990 --> 09:02.238
we're having a little meeting here,

09:02.240 --> 09:03.703
but as soon as we are done,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.728
we would love to have you join us.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.548
Yeah, and now I will direct you,

09:09.550 --> 09:10.403
to be gone.

09:11.730 --> 09:15.047
Well how about if I direct you to dance?

09:28.335 --> 09:33.335
Pepper.

09:57.426 --> 10:02.426
I said, dance.

10:02.826 --> 10:04.446
Pepper.

10:04.448 --> 10:07.398
Put it down.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.973
Pepper, put it down.

10:11.290 --> 10:12.683
I said put it down.

10:17.434 --> 10:19.128
You draw that gun,

10:19.130 --> 10:21.633
and you won't be runnin' upstairs
with Belle any time soon.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.820
Gosh Marshal, I was just funnin'.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.240
Now the name's Charles Tilghman,

10:36.256 --> 10:38.168
but you can call me Chuck.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.278
Little Mary.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.008
Bat, Chuck,

10:42.010 --> 10:43.918
get this bushwhacker
and his genius friends

10:43.920 --> 10:45.168
out of my saloon.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.870
Let 'em cool off for a day to two.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.700
I ain't goin' to no jail.

11:13.710 --> 11:16.118
Good call, not using
that pea-shooter of yours.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.018
No sense anybody gettin'
hurt for no reason.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.558
You must be Marshal Bill Tilghman,

11:20.560 --> 11:22.158
the way you handled that situation.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.548
Could be, who wants to know?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.068
William Selig, Eagle Film Company.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.554
Mister Selig.

11:28.556 --> 11:30.092
Selig.

11:30.094 --> 11:31.573
It's what I said, Selig.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.165
This is our director, Herr Gulman.

11:35.167 --> 11:36.292
Hello.

11:36.294 --> 11:38.578
And this is Edith Hathaway,
our production supervisor.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.648
I tell you if she doesn't like it,

11:39.650 --> 11:41.228
it's out of the picture.

11:41.230 --> 11:42.858
And this is my daughter, Melody,

11:42.860 --> 11:44.510
fresh from Saint Mary's Seminary.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.048
Hollywood land.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.050
Yes sir.

11:50.090 --> 11:51.073
California.

11:52.020 --> 11:53.020
Yes sir.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.068
What do you want with me?

11:56.070 --> 11:57.170
Mister Tilghman sir,

11:58.160 --> 12:00.143
we have a proposition for you.

12:06.071 --> 12:07.478
You know, I don't know why

12:07.480 --> 12:08.808
you let Pepper just cause trouble,

12:08.810 --> 12:10.188
all the time, and then what,

12:10.190 --> 12:12.008
you got one, two days?

12:12.010 --> 12:13.210
Just leave him in there.

12:42.693 --> 12:43.610
Oh, okay.

12:48.906 --> 12:51.658
Daddy, is that a knife?

12:51.660 --> 12:52.918
You're gettin' pretty
good at that knife, Malachi,

12:52.920 --> 12:55.548
but you best be real careful.

12:55.550 --> 12:56.948
Yes sir, Marshal T.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.368
Daddy, did you hear what Mom did?

12:59.370 --> 13:01.133
Daddy Mom's been fighting again.

13:02.530 --> 13:03.628
What?

13:03.630 --> 13:05.880
Heard she dropped a
cowpoke with one punch.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.173
Come on.

13:14.950 --> 13:15.988
Where's your mother?

13:15.990 --> 13:17.290
In the barn with Victor.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.088
Go on, make yourself useful.

13:21.090 --> 13:23.463
You tell Mama we'll be in in a minute.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.203
Bye Missus T.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.853
Becky I sat a place
for you at the table.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.928
Oh, why thank you Missus T.

13:44.930 --> 13:45.953
I would love that.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.858
Well I know that I
should have known better,

13:55.860 --> 13:57.998
you one-eyed grouch.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.915
I couldn't help myself.

13:59.917 --> 14:03.588
He was just goin' on and
on like he always does.

14:03.590 --> 14:07.420
It's just so hard not to just take him...

14:08.880 --> 14:09.713
Hi.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.830
I don't know what happened.

14:13.780 --> 14:14.738
Okay, I do know what happened.

14:14.740 --> 14:16.278
It was that troublemaker, Will Pepper,

14:16.280 --> 14:17.828
he was just going on and on,

14:17.830 --> 14:19.238
cussing in the flicker tent,

14:19.240 --> 14:22.868
and then I just couldn't take
it anymore, so just, pow.

14:22.870 --> 14:23.703
He went down.

14:27.510 --> 14:28.343
Impressive.

14:29.610 --> 14:30.441
I feel awful.

14:30.443 --> 14:31.458
I know you're the Marshal,

14:31.460 --> 14:35.418
and I look like a common
fightin' in the streets.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.553
You just gotta stop hoppin' folks.

14:37.555 --> 14:38.955
You're gettin' a reputation.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.073
I'm hungry.

14:44.005 --> 14:46.055
Think you can hold a fork with this hand?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.300
I'll do just fine with this one.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.113
Go on, git.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.687
Thanks for listenin'.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.453
Don't be so grouchy next time.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.588
Malachi, how's your daddy doing?

15:22.590 --> 15:25.368
Fine ma'am, he's working late as usual.

15:25.370 --> 15:27.688
That's the reason your dad's
the best gunsmith around,

15:27.690 --> 15:28.840
because he works at it.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.758
Now boys you remember that.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.578
That's a good lesson.

15:33.580 --> 15:38.448
Because your daddy, Malachi,
does not sit around all day

15:38.450 --> 15:39.728
twiddlin' his life away.

15:39.730 --> 15:44.730
No sir, he actually works
at a respectable craft,

15:46.850 --> 15:51.850
and everybody is proud to
own a Woody Jeffries gun,

15:51.940 --> 15:53.908
because there just ain't none better.

15:53.910 --> 15:56.840
Now Mama, Malachi does work all his days

15:56.842 --> 15:58.218
at his daddy's shop,

15:58.220 --> 16:00.998
and Tench is apprenticing at the livery,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.708
and he goes to school.

16:02.710 --> 16:05.273
So can they take a little
time to eat dinner?

16:06.220 --> 16:09.143
I guess so, but when I was young,

16:11.130 --> 16:15.028
nobody worked as hard
as we did, comin' up.

16:15.030 --> 16:16.438
Mama.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.348
Could we get on with it

16:17.350 --> 16:19.237
before the food gets too cold to eat?

16:20.214 --> 16:21.297
I guess so.

16:22.602 --> 16:24.381
Chuck.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.083
Aw Pa, you know I'm no
good at giving the blessings.

16:29.430 --> 16:30.263
Tench.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.183
Thank you Lord, for the food,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.923
and please Lord,

16:39.970 --> 16:43.163
help Mama be more tolerant of
those she doesn't understand.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.253
And Lord Jesus,

16:49.280 --> 16:54.280
help this old woman to remind these boys,

16:54.980 --> 16:57.208
she is the one that cooks the food

16:57.210 --> 17:00.248
they puts in their smart little mouths.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.889
Amen.

17:01.891 --> 17:03.148
Amen.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.488
That's a good point, Mama.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.548
Boys, don't mess with the cook.

17:06.550 --> 17:07.848
Ain't that right, Frankie?

17:07.849 --> 17:09.843
Right Pop, never mess with the cook.

17:19.190 --> 17:20.740
Feel like dryin' some dishes?

17:23.940 --> 17:25.089
What's wrong, you okay?

17:26.962 --> 17:29.012
I had an interesting proposition today.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.923
Kind of my own flicker experience.

17:33.372 --> 17:34.948
If you were at the show,
I didn't see you there.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.068
No, down at the saloon.

17:37.070 --> 17:39.308
Some folks from California,

17:39.310 --> 17:41.010
they want to put me on the screen.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.508
There's not a big enough one out there.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.008
It's true.

17:46.010 --> 17:47.848
This Hollywood fellow
wants Bat, Bear, and me,

17:47.850 --> 17:50.198
to make a picture show about outlaws.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.468
The thing is, they want us.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.163
Not play actors, us.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.520
Wait, you're serious?

18:00.100 --> 18:03.413
And Zoe, they want to
use real outlaws, too.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.358
This bull goose named Selig,

18:07.360 --> 18:08.728
he said the people back east

18:08.730 --> 18:11.668
are clamoring for the real
thing, not make believe.

18:11.670 --> 18:14.668
Now he knows Tom Osborne
at the territorial prison.

18:14.670 --> 18:17.098
He said we could get out a
few prominent hard cases,

18:17.100 --> 18:18.888
have them rob the bank,

18:18.890 --> 18:20.188
there'll be this big shootout,

18:20.190 --> 18:22.208
and we'll lock 'em up.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.898
And would you believe it's only gonna take

18:23.900 --> 18:25.248
two weeks to make this thing happen.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.365
Sound like a good way
to get yourself shot.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.058
No no, no real bullets.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.468
And the prisoners, they
will always be under guard.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.301
Bill, this sounds like

18:32.303 --> 18:34.290
you're actually considering this nonsense.

18:35.870 --> 18:36.988
The dime novels are everywhere

18:36.990 --> 18:39.458
making outlaws into heroes.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.608
Scoundrels, murderers, and
thieves is all they are,

18:41.610 --> 18:44.678
but to the folks back
east, they're heroes.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.328
This could be an opportunity to show 'em

18:46.330 --> 18:47.530
what it used to be like.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.753
Besides.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.633
Oh my.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.563
That's more money than you've
made in the past five years.

19:09.850 --> 19:10.683
Yep.

19:11.890 --> 19:14.190
Bat and the boys'll get
a good payday as well.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
What do you think?

19:26.100 --> 19:27.623
I think I'm gonna say yes,

19:28.940 --> 19:30.590
before they come to their senses.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.600
All right then.

19:42.710 --> 19:47.002
Incredible, magnificent,
Miss Hathaway look at this.

19:47.004 --> 19:50.921
It's like a light canvas,
just waiting for art.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.968
William, we've called
our entire population in,

19:56.970 --> 19:59.408
and selected a few of our
more stellar residents

19:59.410 --> 20:00.828
for you to choose from.

20:00.830 --> 20:01.778
Excellent.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.608
They're not pretty but,

20:03.610 --> 20:06.288
we've spiffied them up for the occasion.

20:06.290 --> 20:09.343
And I guarantee, they will
be on their best behavior.

20:21.838 --> 20:24.672
What's wrong, preacher man?

20:24.674 --> 20:25.505
Gentlemen.

20:25.507 --> 20:26.340
Gentlemen!

20:27.360 --> 20:30.038
Some men are born great,

20:30.040 --> 20:33.098
some men achieve greatness,

20:33.100 --> 20:36.728
and some have it thrust upon them.

20:36.730 --> 20:39.283
Murphy, call in your dogs.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.863
All you dopes get in line.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.018
Gentlemen, Marshal Tilghman

20:52.020 --> 20:55.548
and these Hollywood flicker
men are here for a reason,

20:55.550 --> 20:58.733
and it's not because they want
to look at your pretty faces.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.248
No, they want to put eight
of you fine aristocrats

21:03.250 --> 21:04.513
in a moving picture.

21:05.450 --> 21:08.868
You'll be 10 feet tall on the big screen,

21:08.870 --> 21:09.883
and live forever.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.718
Now, Mister Tilghman has arrested

21:13.720 --> 21:15.323
many of you over the years.

21:16.970 --> 21:19.853
And it looks like he's gonna
get the chance to do it again.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.248
In our moving picture,

21:22.250 --> 21:24.438
you're gonna pretend to rob a bank.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.528
And Mister Tilghman and his men

21:25.530 --> 21:28.338
are gonna pretend to arrest you.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.248
Pardon the interruption
there, your honor,

21:30.250 --> 21:33.818
but what do we get out of this?

21:33.820 --> 21:37.228
Exceptin' the pleasure of
Tilghman's sorry company.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.488
Well the seven or eight men we choose,

21:39.490 --> 21:42.208
will be put up in the
finest hotel in Fort Bowers,

21:42.210 --> 21:45.353
and you will dine on steak and apple pie.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.368
Every night our budget allows

21:48.370 --> 21:51.785
for two whiskeys and one good cigar.

21:51.787 --> 21:53.563
And if you have a woman, well.

21:54.502 --> 21:57.818
And what's to keep us
from havin' a fine meal,

21:57.820 --> 21:59.718
and a good cigar,

21:59.720 --> 22:02.113
and then beatin' boots out of town?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.398
Good question.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.408
The warden has also agreed

22:06.410 --> 22:08.618
to loan us some of his best guards.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.943
Anyone tryin' to escape,

22:14.220 --> 22:15.053
well.

22:16.825 --> 22:17.818
But for two weeks gentlemen,

22:17.820 --> 22:19.293
you will be in tall cotton.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.963
Look, if you're not interested,

22:24.000 --> 22:24.833
I get it.

22:26.420 --> 22:27.743
Step back.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.798
All right, we'll move amongst you,

22:33.800 --> 22:35.050
we'll pick our eight men.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.273
Cole.

22:42.190 --> 22:43.023
Tilghman.

22:44.999 --> 22:45.949
You're lookin' old.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.773
Beats not lookin' old, I guess.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.153
I wasted time, now time wastes me.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.260
Still takin' a shine to Shakespeare.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.728
All the world's a stage,

23:00.730 --> 23:03.143
and all the women and men like to play.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.653
Great Caesar's Ghost.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.478
That's Cole Younger, in the flesh.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.668
He's got to be in the picture.

23:14.670 --> 23:16.508
Guaranteed trouble.

23:16.510 --> 23:18.328
People will line up to see the man

23:18.330 --> 23:21.273
who was shot 17 times in
Northfield, Minnesota.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.900
What's wrong with him?

23:30.870 --> 23:33.020
He wound up on the
wrong side of the law.

23:33.867 --> 23:35.363
Nobody'll pay to see him.

23:48.120 --> 23:48.953
Murphy.

23:50.230 --> 23:51.548
Mister Tilghman.

23:51.550 --> 23:54.778
I never thought I'd see
you after the trial.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.223
I told it like it was.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.928
Your testimony left me
to rot in this hell hole.

24:00.930 --> 24:04.118
Nothing would satisfy me more
than to have you rot with me.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.663
You gut-shot an old man.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.798
He was cheating at cards.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.853
He was drunk.

24:10.220 --> 24:11.898
He deserved it.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.150
You deserve it, and
that's why you're here.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.233
You took away my freedom,
Tilghman, I want it back.

24:20.540 --> 24:21.890
They should have hung ya.

24:24.750 --> 24:27.918
Tell me Bill, how is
young Missus Tilghman?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.169
Zoe is it?

24:30.467 --> 24:34.238
Hear tell she's pleasing.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.073
Don't.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.018
Oh, temper Bill.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.538
Idle threats don't become
a man of your stature.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.990
You're right, what's
the point of idle threats?

24:50.580 --> 24:53.628
Don't you ever speak of my wife again.

24:53.630 --> 24:55.368
Circumstances have me at a bit

24:55.370 --> 24:56.678
of a disadvantage, Marshal,

24:56.680 --> 24:59.758
but perhaps fate will afford
us another opportunity.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.960
Circumstance be damned,
let's finish this.

25:03.706 --> 25:05.271
Now take it back.

25:05.273 --> 25:07.448
All right, all right.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.283
Let me go.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.658
Big Joe.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.493
BT.

25:32.593 --> 25:33.518
Is that Bear?

25:33.520 --> 25:34.473
In the flesh.

25:36.570 --> 25:37.778
Thought he'd be dead by now.

25:37.780 --> 25:40.163
Yeah well, he came
close once or twice but,

25:42.210 --> 25:44.773
he saw Jesus, but he sent him back.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.140
I saw Jesus once.

25:52.610 --> 25:54.860
Joe, you want to be
in this moving flicker?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.418
You know I saw a moving picture once,

25:58.420 --> 25:59.963
with Miss Lillian Gish,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.218
she paraded around like a ballerina.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.771
I was never more in love with a woman.

26:08.039 --> 26:09.989
I think I saw that down in New Orleans.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.173
That's where I saw Jesus, like Bear.

26:16.810 --> 26:18.110
Yeah, down in New Orleans.

26:20.870 --> 26:21.763
Okay BT.

26:23.260 --> 26:25.018
Yeah, I'll be in your moving picture,

26:25.020 --> 26:27.388
as long as my brother can do it too.

26:27.390 --> 26:29.131
See, if we was on a screen together,

26:29.133 --> 26:30.823
it'd be like a walk in heaven.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.333
Sounds dumb.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.673
I don't know.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.048
Makes sense to me.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.798
Where's your brother?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.088
Beats me.

26:42.090 --> 26:45.233
If you're Big Joe,
is there a Little Joe?

26:46.960 --> 26:49.138
His mother's watching him.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.290
He's got his condition.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.088
This Chicken Man, what's wrong with him?

27:01.090 --> 27:02.568
Sad case.

27:02.570 --> 27:04.543
Kid got on the wrong side of the law.

27:06.610 --> 27:09.328
I hear a pardon's coming
down the road any day now.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.080
Then nobody would pay to see him.

27:12.950 --> 27:14.323
What about Murphy?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.078
Murphy and his henchmen

27:17.080 --> 27:20.258
have been the bane of my
existence for six months.

27:20.260 --> 27:23.123
They go, or no one goes.

27:26.820 --> 27:28.578
Please tell Mister Murphy

27:28.580 --> 27:33.580
that we sure would appreciate
him and his friends

27:33.960 --> 27:34.793
in our picture.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.193
Okay gentlemen,

27:40.260 --> 27:41.760
they have made their decision.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.228
I'm sorry we can't take all of you,

27:45.230 --> 27:47.848
but if the picture makes a profit,

27:47.850 --> 27:49.288
we'll be back.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.848
And before we announce our selected cast,

27:52.850 --> 27:56.128
we are elated to announce

27:56.130 --> 27:58.958
that the celebrated Frank James

27:58.960 --> 28:01.123
has agreed to appear in our picture show.

28:03.453 --> 28:05.358
You didn't tell me you hired James.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.498
You know Frank and Cole
road together, right?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.078
That news did reach California.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.488
Sure it did.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.283
Their reunion will be legendary.

28:13.616 --> 28:14.616
Legendary?

28:15.541 --> 28:16.708
And dangerous.

28:25.396 --> 28:27.979
What are you pondering, Cole?

28:29.060 --> 28:30.573
The turns life takes.

28:33.701 --> 28:34.868
What like robbin' a bank one day,

28:34.870 --> 28:36.963
then play acting the next?

28:38.747 --> 28:41.208
Now they're gonna pretend to arrest us,

28:41.210 --> 28:42.883
for pretending to rob a bank.

28:44.947 --> 28:47.353
We all become what we pretend to be.

28:48.390 --> 28:49.223
Is that so?

28:51.930 --> 28:53.080
You ever pretend, Cole?

28:54.350 --> 28:56.853
I never pretended to
do a thing in my life.

29:09.709 --> 29:12.618
I noticed a change in your countenance.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.870
You're obsessed readin'
that book constantly.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.530
You think it's gonna
capture all your demons?

29:20.510 --> 29:23.068
Let me tell you how this is gonna go.

29:23.070 --> 29:25.603
No man gets out of this life alive.

29:27.550 --> 29:29.138
It's like your little novel says,

29:29.140 --> 29:32.523
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.778
Yeah, I just been thinkin' Murphy,

29:35.780 --> 29:37.363
there's gotta be a better way.

29:38.583 --> 29:39.433
I aim to find it.

29:40.860 --> 29:41.710
I ain't like you.

29:43.670 --> 29:45.798
I got a wife and kids back in a holler.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.038
When I leave this place,

29:48.040 --> 29:50.718
I want to find us some peace.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.293
You'd be a fool to think
you'd find it in that book.

29:56.270 --> 29:58.370
Redemption awaits for those who seek it.

30:02.150 --> 30:04.013
Let me be clear with you, Joe.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.653
Redemption is not at all what I seek.

30:10.660 --> 30:11.907
Let's go, Cherokee.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.030
All seems to be going
well with our wild bunch.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.918
You know, if we had a few
more of our desparados,

30:22.920 --> 30:24.620
we would have had our dirty dozen.

30:25.510 --> 30:27.798
If you add any more, I quit.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.208
And just call 'em outlaws,
'cause that's all they are.

30:30.210 --> 30:33.253
Nothin' more, and sure
as certain, nothin' less.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.498
I think we just named our picture.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.767
Bill Tilghman and the Outlaws.

30:59.435 --> 31:01.633
Get up, get up there.

31:01.635 --> 31:02.718
Get up there.

31:46.410 --> 31:50.359
Here comes the old
medicine show, right now.

32:13.761 --> 32:16.768
Bill Tilghman, have you lost your mind?

32:16.770 --> 32:17.603
Maybe.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.043
Yep, the legendary Bill Tilghman,

32:23.150 --> 32:25.333
escorting convicts in to town.

32:27.230 --> 32:28.630
What's this world coming to?

32:30.160 --> 32:31.803
Well, Marshal Tilghman.

32:33.650 --> 32:34.963
This is something indeed.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.063
Reverend Lowe, indeed.

32:46.150 --> 32:47.667
Well would you look at that?

32:48.540 --> 32:50.088
Cole Younger.

32:50.090 --> 32:52.267
Marshal, dagnabbit Marshal.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.428
You gotta let me out of here.

32:55.430 --> 32:57.488
Why that's Cole Younger.

32:57.490 --> 32:59.703
And him and I are like that.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.763
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.598
Oh all right.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.918
Go ahead and let all three of them out.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.820
They're smellin' up the place, anyway.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.618
I hear
you're gonna be filming,

33:12.620 --> 33:14.208
even on Sundays.

33:14.210 --> 33:15.808
It's not my idea.

33:15.810 --> 33:17.360
Everybody works for somebody.

33:18.990 --> 33:21.295
I'll be holding services anyway.

33:21.297 --> 33:22.378
It may just be me and my maker,

33:22.380 --> 33:24.483
but I'll be spreading his word.

33:25.810 --> 33:27.048
Sorry I won't be able to spread it

33:27.050 --> 33:29.318
to the likes of these desperadoes.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.468
The wife tells me the Grange

33:30.470 --> 33:32.638
is planning some sort of celebration,

33:32.640 --> 33:34.790
to welcome Mister Selig
and his movie crew.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.388
Charity warrants that we
extend that invitation

33:38.390 --> 33:39.683
to include our prisoners.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.542
Really?

33:41.544 --> 33:42.375
Yeah.

33:42.377 --> 33:43.210
I hadn't heard.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.193
More good news.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.443
Things just get better don't they?

33:56.877 --> 33:58.023
All right gentlemen.

34:06.417 --> 34:08.808
Come on in, gentlemen.

34:08.810 --> 34:09.641
One at a time.

34:09.643 --> 34:10.560
You know the drill.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.697
It's gonna be sentimental,
it's gonna be gorgeous.

34:17.699 --> 34:18.978
We have to find a way to work that in.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.623
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.820
I would challenge you
to a battle of wits,

34:26.856 --> 34:28.250
but I see you are unarmed.

34:31.228 --> 34:33.827
Make sure that we keep track of that.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.728
Hey, hey Mister Younger.

34:50.730 --> 34:51.683
Remember me?

34:52.870 --> 34:54.338
Well well well,

34:54.340 --> 34:55.643
the great Will Pepper.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.058
Been a long time.

34:58.060 --> 34:59.521
Yeah, I used to ride with you.

34:59.523 --> 35:02.268
Yes, yes you did,

35:02.270 --> 35:05.578
for almost five full days as I remember.

35:05.580 --> 35:08.023
Well, I'm friends with Frank James now.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.238
Really?

35:10.240 --> 35:11.840
Well ain't that somethin' extra?

35:12.700 --> 35:14.198
Will, you make sure to meet up with me

35:14.200 --> 35:15.498
in the next day or two,

35:15.500 --> 35:19.148
and we'll relive old times.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.883
Yes sir, Mister Younger.

35:21.850 --> 35:23.473
Cole, sir.

35:27.140 --> 35:30.643
And thus, do I make my fool my purse.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.843
Cole Younger.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.873
Alice Thompson.

37:10.368 --> 37:11.368
The beautiful Alice.

37:12.380 --> 37:14.417
You wooed and warned me.

37:21.487 --> 37:23.663
For you, Mister Younger.

37:26.430 --> 37:28.390
And this

37:29.790 --> 37:32.198
pungent relic

37:32.200 --> 37:34.408
remains behind for the last time

37:34.410 --> 37:36.060
you graced me with your presence.

37:38.750 --> 37:39.688
Big Joe,

37:39.690 --> 37:42.463
I would like to introduce
you to Alice Thompson.

37:43.370 --> 37:45.028
She is the former owner

37:45.030 --> 37:48.398
of the premier social club in Sweetwater.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.688
Howdy.

37:49.690 --> 37:51.328
My pleasure mister?

37:51.330 --> 37:53.003
Come on, come on!

37:55.660 --> 37:58.677
Hell no, where's my good-for-nothin'...

37:58.679 --> 37:59.512
No.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.162
Come on, come on.

38:04.128 --> 38:07.018
You ain't carryin' nothin',
are you Miss Darling?

38:07.020 --> 38:09.052
Oh hell no.

38:09.054 --> 38:12.978
I'm just here to see my
good-for-nothin' son.

38:12.980 --> 38:13.813
Where is he?

38:16.900 --> 38:18.793
Will you come on?

38:26.870 --> 38:28.198
Howdy.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.193
That's better.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.093
Little Joe!

38:34.140 --> 38:36.483
Oh this is gonna be one fun night.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.663
Gentlemen, gentlemen, ladies.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.778
We hope you've been enjoying
Fort Bowers' hospitality.

39:39.780 --> 39:41.378
Mister Gulman and I

39:41.380 --> 39:43.563
ask for your undivided attention, please.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.268
We'd like to introduce the
esteemed Mayor of Fort Bowers,

39:47.270 --> 39:48.253
Jonathan Gray.

39:50.350 --> 39:51.183
Good morning.

39:53.130 --> 39:55.653
I know you folks ain't
used to many surprises.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.968
But before Mister Selig
puts you to work tomorrow,

39:59.970 --> 40:01.998
the fine folks of Fort Bowers

40:02.000 --> 40:04.013
have drummed up a special this evening.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.693
But I need your word of honor,

40:09.480 --> 40:11.780
that you're going to be
on your best behavior.

41:07.189 --> 41:10.356
Why, you are powerful pretty, ma'am.

41:11.762 --> 41:13.568
The sun rises and the sun sets

41:13.570 --> 41:16.953
and there ain't nothin'
prettier than you, my Juliet.

41:18.630 --> 41:19.630
That is Shakespeare.

41:21.476 --> 41:22.600
No it's not.

41:22.602 --> 41:23.769
No it's not.

41:25.273 --> 41:27.123
I guess I'll never be a Cole Younger.

41:28.952 --> 41:30.468
And my name's not Juliet.

41:30.470 --> 41:32.370
But I do thank you for the compliment.

41:33.670 --> 41:35.768
Making rounds, help us pass the time,

41:35.770 --> 41:38.243
when you're in prison.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.963
I imagine so, John.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.900
How do you know my name?

41:45.140 --> 41:45.973
It's my job.

41:47.450 --> 41:49.708
Sweetheart, we need you
to take some.

41:49.710 --> 41:50.563
Excuse us.

41:51.450 --> 41:53.498
Hey, what's your name?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.400
Melody.

41:55.420 --> 41:56.253
Melody?

41:57.217 --> 41:58.717
Melody.

42:21.990 --> 42:25.583
Rum and sugar, be a
fault, God bless the wicked.

42:26.770 --> 42:28.570
The infamous Cole Younger.

42:29.428 --> 42:31.653
The infamous guest, Cole Younger.

42:32.830 --> 42:33.863
Frank James.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.243
No, I haven't touched a
drop since Northfield.

42:42.291 --> 42:43.653
Yeah, that was a while ago.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.423
Frank James, haberdasher.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.938
Time heals all wounds.

42:51.940 --> 42:52.883
Not all, Cole.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.173
I guess so, whence the grave.

42:58.070 --> 42:59.663
Frank James.

43:01.140 --> 43:04.868
I hear tell Frank James
is gonna be joining

43:04.870 --> 43:09.373
the less-fortunate
amongst us, to rob a bank.

43:11.940 --> 43:14.633
It's entertainment, Cole, entertainment.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.265
That's all it is.

43:17.267 --> 43:20.093
Oh yeah, I can be very entertaining.

43:33.557 --> 43:35.474
Thank you, thank you.

43:40.017 --> 43:41.403
Ladies and gentleman,

43:42.800 --> 43:44.993
welcome on this historic occasion.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.940
The times have been hard for
many of us here in Fort Bowers.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.300
I hear you all's Bill
Tilghman's oldest boy.

43:57.180 --> 43:58.980
And what are you yappin' on about?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.073
Outlaw?

44:02.220 --> 44:04.378
You talk like your daddy.

44:04.380 --> 44:05.530
You ain't got no badge.

44:06.630 --> 44:08.293
Pay no attention to him.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.383
Straight up, junior.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.268
You get a punch, I get a punch.

44:17.270 --> 44:19.083
We'll flip to see who goes first.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.393
Don't be a fool.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.009
- You think that I'm...
- Relax.

44:24.011 --> 44:24.908
...gonna stand here and watch you

44:24.910 --> 44:25.741
do your.

44:25.743 --> 44:26.973
It's just good, clean fun.

44:28.930 --> 44:29.763
To growth.

44:56.140 --> 44:58.390
This is only gonna
hurt for a little while.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.648
Now, are you gonna talk me to death?

45:02.650 --> 45:05.300
Or are you gonna tighten up
those britches and fight?

45:06.570 --> 45:08.847
Why you arrogant little piss-ant.

45:13.080 --> 45:13.913
Gentlemen.

45:15.950 --> 45:17.093
Mister Masterson.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.203
Can I interest you in a cigar?

45:21.580 --> 45:23.493
You two aren't celebrating.

45:24.790 --> 45:25.963
Too old, I reckon.

45:28.297 --> 45:32.658
I may be old, but I am
still strong and lusty.

45:32.660 --> 45:33.493
Rusty?

45:34.400 --> 45:35.513
Did you say, rusty?

45:37.430 --> 45:40.318
There was a time Mister Masterson.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.103
How about I will have a cigar,

45:44.090 --> 45:46.343
if you will join me in a drink.

45:47.260 --> 45:50.483
And what would we be
drinkin' to, Mister Masterson?

45:51.810 --> 45:54.668
To a long, peaceful life.

45:54.670 --> 45:56.513
Well sir, that I will drink to.

45:58.010 --> 45:58.843
Been thinking,

46:00.350 --> 46:03.678
how did you two good souls

46:03.680 --> 46:05.853
crawl into so many dark holes?

46:07.270 --> 46:10.898
Maybe a couple of young men, brothers,

46:10.900 --> 46:13.623
were ridin' back to Missouri,

46:14.740 --> 46:15.853
from the States War.

46:17.080 --> 46:17.913
They get home,

46:20.130 --> 46:23.873
and the new order has
given their farm to a Yank.

46:27.070 --> 46:28.548
That's okay.

46:28.550 --> 46:32.588
Carpetbagger offered 'em a job,

46:32.590 --> 46:34.993
on their own farm, sloppin' hogs.

46:36.490 --> 46:38.163
Same thing in town, too.

46:39.060 --> 46:42.018
Sweep my floors, Reb.

46:42.020 --> 46:44.378
Thin out this platoon, Reb.

46:44.380 --> 46:48.993
Hell, couldn't vote, couldn't
even preach in a church.

46:50.870 --> 46:53.013
Well, you preach it.

46:55.177 --> 46:57.228
You're missing the point, Masterson.

46:57.230 --> 46:58.821
It's not that I wanted to.

46:58.823 --> 47:00.093
It's that I couldn't.

47:01.470 --> 47:02.790
Maybe these fellas

47:03.980 --> 47:07.410
could think that the bankers
and the carpetbaggers

47:08.300 --> 47:09.423
took all their money,

47:10.870 --> 47:12.343
deserved to be got after.

47:14.780 --> 47:15.613
For example,

47:18.230 --> 47:20.128
you are talking metaphorically,

47:20.130 --> 47:21.308
aren't you there, Frank?

47:21.310 --> 47:24.593
You're not saying that
we were robbin' anybody?

47:26.150 --> 47:29.368
Still if some of those land-robbers

47:29.370 --> 47:32.163
and carpetbaggers took a bullet.

47:33.110 --> 47:34.828
For example.

47:34.830 --> 47:36.180
What are you, his lawyer?

47:37.100 --> 47:41.138
Who could say who's the bad guy here?

47:41.140 --> 47:41.973
For example.

47:46.339 --> 47:47.868
I mean they're just trying to get back

47:47.870 --> 47:49.513
what these people took from 'em.

47:51.950 --> 47:53.450
To brighter days, gentlemen.

47:54.870 --> 47:59.068
May all our dark holes
be filled with light.

47:59.070 --> 48:01.113
Yes, to that I will drink.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.478
Well Bat, I'm gonna pass on that drink

48:05.480 --> 48:07.188
because I kind of like

48:07.190 --> 48:09.140
having a little darkness with my light.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.068
I guess we're just more comfortable

48:13.070 --> 48:15.543
living with our shadows, Bat.

48:16.770 --> 48:18.183
Well hell,

48:19.872 --> 48:21.180
I'll drink to that then.

49:24.974 --> 49:27.258
- Come on.
- Get him.

49:27.260 --> 49:29.518
Young Missus Tilghman,

49:29.520 --> 49:30.943
I like your authority.

49:32.050 --> 49:35.143
I dub thee Zoe, Queen of Clubs.

49:36.210 --> 49:37.440
And I

49:39.360 --> 49:41.713
a mere knave, at your service.

49:44.730 --> 49:47.278
You are an animal, Mister Murphy.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.608
That's why you're in a cage.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.993
And you are so penetrating.

49:53.170 --> 49:56.003
It's a shame you have to
live in the shadow of a man.

49:58.530 --> 50:00.638
BT will kill you for this.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.763
Yes well, on that very matter,

50:05.010 --> 50:07.108
will you look at what I have here?

50:09.900 --> 50:11.532
You are a saloon-keeper's wife.

50:11.534 --> 50:12.365
You know what they call

50:12.367 --> 50:14.718
this little old player here, don't you?

50:14.720 --> 50:16.263
The suicide king.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.710
And he

50:19.690 --> 50:21.183
leaves a widow queen,

50:22.370 --> 50:23.470
to tend to the orphan.

50:29.387 --> 50:33.304
Oh, the touch of a woman,
it had been too long.

50:34.150 --> 50:35.953
Go play on someone else, Murphy.

50:37.460 --> 50:40.808
I am merely servicing you
with an advance courtesy,

50:40.810 --> 50:43.210
about this game is going
to be played, my queen.

50:44.170 --> 50:45.908
Time to leave the table.

50:45.910 --> 50:47.928
Oh and why

50:47.930 --> 50:49.210
would I do that?

51:15.661 --> 51:20.661
Break it up boys!

51:21.290 --> 51:22.643
Don't even think about it.

51:30.390 --> 51:31.223
Come on.

51:38.871 --> 51:41.704
Yes man, we have one, four, six.

51:44.074 --> 51:45.048
Eight, 10.

51:45.050 --> 51:46.338
Ow!

51:46.340 --> 51:48.008
Oh shut up.

51:48.010 --> 51:48.983
You deserve it.

51:55.110 --> 51:56.568
Somethin' wrong?

51:56.570 --> 51:58.878
It's just Murphy, he's
acting the fool again.

51:58.880 --> 51:59.968
No, leave him be, please.

51:59.970 --> 52:00.920
Let's just go home.

52:03.300 --> 52:04.133
All right.

52:07.780 --> 52:09.478
Move along gentlemen.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.858
Hey, where's your Alice?

52:11.860 --> 52:12.693
No tellin'.

52:13.993 --> 52:16.693
I sure did rattle
Tilghman's woman tonight.

52:17.720 --> 52:20.308
I'll find you
facedown in a ditch somewhere.

52:20.310 --> 52:22.808
Maybe so,
and Tilghman'll bleedin'

52:22.810 --> 52:24.088
in the mud with me.

52:24.090 --> 52:26.838
Murphy, back off.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.558
What for?

52:28.560 --> 52:30.898
Never mind, must back off.

52:30.900 --> 52:32.168
You'll ruin everything.

52:32.170 --> 52:34.170
Cole Younger, you are up to something.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.170
Not here, Murphy.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.968
Come on, come on Cole.

52:39.970 --> 52:41.128
As long as Tilghman's mine,

52:41.130 --> 52:42.105
I want in, whatever it is.

52:42.107 --> 52:44.828
There are more things
in heaven and Earth,

52:44.830 --> 52:47.638
than dreamt of in all your philosophies.

52:47.640 --> 52:49.293
So back off.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.073
Age cannot whither her,

53:10.620 --> 53:13.783
nor customs fail her infinite variety.

53:15.880 --> 53:20.648
You know, all the time
we've been together,

53:20.650 --> 53:22.600
I've never believed a word you've said.

53:24.730 --> 53:26.180
But I sure love hearing them.

53:30.120 --> 53:33.218
Seems that neither one
of us could shed the other.

53:33.220 --> 53:34.093
Seems so.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.000
I quit trying to make sense of it.

53:39.753 --> 53:42.003
I just show up and do
your biddin' and leave,

53:43.520 --> 53:45.820
never knowin' when I'll
lay eyes on you again.

53:46.810 --> 53:49.563
Months, years,

53:51.260 --> 53:52.093
never.

53:54.783 --> 53:56.433
There's no reason to leave now.

53:57.920 --> 53:58.820
I think it best.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.518
Look, we could always just...

54:04.520 --> 54:06.193
Not this time, Cole.

54:08.583 --> 54:09.583
It don't feel right.

54:13.020 --> 54:14.920
Another year, and you'd be a free man.

54:16.010 --> 54:18.913
Yet something tells me you're
gonna throw it all away.

54:22.106 --> 54:23.513
I couldn't stand by and watch.

54:24.770 --> 54:26.943
I've been promised parole before.

54:28.750 --> 54:32.948
Oh Alice, I grew up close
to the heart of nature,

54:32.950 --> 54:35.783
in the forest, in the
saddle, always on the move.

54:36.810 --> 54:40.783
To imprison me, is like
cagin' a wild bird.

54:46.470 --> 54:47.303
Goodbye Cole.

54:50.780 --> 54:52.373
I did what you asked me to.

56:11.403 --> 56:13.568
I cannot tell you how excited I am

56:13.570 --> 56:15.508
to get this project underway.

56:15.510 --> 56:16.818
And since for all of you,

56:16.820 --> 56:19.288
this is your first experience
with moving pictures,

56:19.290 --> 56:20.228
I'm gonna take a moment

56:20.230 --> 56:22.368
and explain just a little bit
about how this process works.

56:22.370 --> 56:24.548
It is art like no other.

56:24.550 --> 56:26.068
We start with nothing,

56:26.070 --> 56:27.008
and then we...

56:27.010 --> 56:29.428
In two weeks, we will
have a picture show

56:29.430 --> 56:31.418
that will excite thousands.

56:31.420 --> 56:33.908
Right now you are being
fitted for costumes,

56:33.910 --> 56:35.878
and outside our crew's
already hard at work

56:35.880 --> 56:37.638
determining where to set up the cameras.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.358
And I know you already
have met Mister Ojala,

56:40.360 --> 56:41.758
he is our armor.

56:41.760 --> 56:44.814
I wanted to use real ammunition, but.

56:44.816 --> 56:45.848
Oh Mister Gulman,

56:45.850 --> 56:47.963
we're gonna have to set up for blanks.

56:49.130 --> 56:52.848
It's my job to avoid any
accidents in the set.

56:52.850 --> 56:55.378
Nobody in the set or off the set,

56:55.380 --> 56:57.328
with exception of the guards,

56:57.330 --> 56:59.207
is gonna carry live ammo.

57:00.090 --> 57:03.003
Ojala, can I see one of
those blank cartridges?

57:07.220 --> 57:10.798
They make a big boom, and
then there's smoke everywhere.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.698
Thank you,
thank you Mister Ojala.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.678
Now, Mister Gulman is going to give you

57:14.680 --> 57:16.978
a brief summary of the action.

57:16.980 --> 57:18.778
Pay close attention.

57:18.780 --> 57:21.688
It's a beautiful spring morning.

57:21.690 --> 57:24.498
The trees are in bloom, birds are singing,

57:24.500 --> 57:26.168
children are playing in the street.

57:26.170 --> 57:27.758
Mister Gulman, remember,

57:27.760 --> 57:31.638
we are talking to the actors
now, not the audience.

57:31.640 --> 57:33.188
Of course.

57:33.190 --> 57:36.378
Our desperadoes, the scourge of the west,

57:36.380 --> 57:38.841
their dark hearts filled
with malicious intent.

57:38.843 --> 57:41.108
Yes, thank you, thank
you, Mister Gulman,

57:41.110 --> 57:42.538
thank you for that.

57:42.540 --> 57:45.948
All right now, our
longest and largest scene

57:45.950 --> 57:49.798
is going to be with our
antagonists, that's you.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.318
You're going to be staged
in three different areas,

57:52.320 --> 57:53.448
on here, and Miss Hathaway

57:53.450 --> 57:55.698
will discuss more of that tomorrow.

57:55.700 --> 58:00.700
Now, one of the difficulties
in making a moving picture,

58:00.950 --> 58:03.528
is that we often shoot out of sequence.

58:03.530 --> 58:05.918
So, we're gonna start with the
most difficult scenes first,

58:05.920 --> 58:07.918
and that's going to be the robbery itself.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.808
For two days we're going
to rehearse the robbery,

58:10.810 --> 58:13.708
and then on the third day
we'll roll the cameras.

58:13.710 --> 58:16.778
Remember to stay where we put you.

58:16.780 --> 58:18.628
That is your mark.

58:18.630 --> 58:20.018
If you move,

58:20.020 --> 58:22.603
you will ruin the composition of my shot.

58:23.450 --> 58:25.928
Film my friends,

58:25.930 --> 58:27.368
is forever.

58:27.370 --> 58:30.673
And no matter what the
fates bring our way,

58:31.570 --> 58:34.070
Bill Tilghman and the
Outlaws, will be our legacy.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.933
Now, time to get to work.

58:43.020 --> 58:46.893
Damn, I never do get used
to seeing that mess of scars.

58:48.700 --> 58:51.633
Ancient ghosts continue to haunt.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.693
11 from Northfield alone.

58:55.780 --> 58:59.828
That wasn't our best adventure, Frank.

58:59.830 --> 59:01.458
Nope.

59:01.460 --> 59:03.933
Yet here you
stand, body and soul.

59:05.590 --> 59:07.148
Evidently.

59:07.150 --> 59:09.628
Well, at least I'll look good

59:09.630 --> 59:11.608
while Tilghman humiliates me

59:11.610 --> 59:13.310
in front of the rest of the world.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.563
The upside is though,

59:16.400 --> 59:19.468
he might be able to make
me look 20 years younger.

59:20.940 --> 59:22.893
It's too late for guys like us.

59:24.090 --> 59:28.260
Perhaps, but perhaps it's not too late

59:29.369 --> 59:30.888
to set it right.

59:30.890 --> 59:32.040
Set what right, Cole?

59:34.890 --> 59:36.680
Northfield, Minnesota.

59:37.890 --> 59:39.408
Northfield?

59:39.410 --> 59:41.488
There ain't no settin' that right, Cole.

59:41.490 --> 59:43.738
The minute we hauled out of that bank,

59:43.740 --> 59:45.123
we didn't have a chance.

59:46.810 --> 59:48.408
I mean you've still got
the scars to prove it.

59:48.410 --> 59:49.928
It cost us dearly.

59:49.930 --> 59:51.758
I gotta set it right, Frank,

59:51.760 --> 59:53.593
and this might be my last chance.

59:54.530 --> 59:56.978
And the upside, is gettin' to knock

59:56.980 --> 59:59.783
that self-righteous Bill
Tilghman off his high horse.

01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:05.747
There's nothing good or bad,
but thinkin' makes it so.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.378
There's always a consequence, Cole.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.928
Perhaps, Frank, we were alive back then.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.038
Hell, they were writin' books about us,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.358
the Robin Hoods of the west.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.743
Now, we're just fodder
for the likes of Tilghman,

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:27.063
forgotten relics from a forgotten age.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.023
You know Cole, I got a good life here.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.388
I own my business.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:36.593
I'm making a living.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.178
I mean, yeah it's a little boring,

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.438
you know I'm kinda bored out of my head.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.248
Every day's the same.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.003
Stitchin' this and measurin' that.

01:00:48.242 --> 01:00:50.543
I'm like an old maid or something.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.130
But I got respect.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.857
But I stand for nothin'.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.253
Oh my God.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.203
What do you got in mind
for me now, Mister Satan?

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.893
What if we rob the bank, for real?

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.038
Why?

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.990
To humiliate the great Bill Tilghman.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.453
Hell if he has his way,
we'll be laughing stock.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.928
On the other hand, if
we can turn the tables,

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.353
rob that bank for real?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.128
Then it it's Tilghman and
Masterson who will play the fools.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.543
And we become the legends.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.563
We might become dead legends.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.518
I have no intention of dying.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.803
Frank, are you in?

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:49.078
As long as it's not another Northfield.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.180
Now how do you see this playing out, Cole?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.888
Come on, come on, come on.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.983
Whatever you two are plannin', I want in.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.123
This calls for a drink.

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:19.038
Hey Pepper, bring that tray over here.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.333
Cole, hey miss your Alice yet?

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.748
Can we trust you?

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.583
You betcha.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.278
All right, we're gonna need a diversion.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.943
Something big, something loud.

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:41.383
Big, loud.

01:02:43.283 --> 01:02:44.116
All right.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:48.303
That book,

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.513
that's gonna make you lose your edge.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.750
Maybe they'll give us a different edge.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.480
Maybe you're not lookin' hard enough.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.818
Joe, right now,

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.467
you better just quit talkin'.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.520
Well maybe...- Shut it.

01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:55.238
Whoa, no no no, you can't
do that, this is my board.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.073
Thank you.

01:04:06.053 --> 01:04:06.884
Sorry.

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:08.750
Sorry really, five minutes.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.680
Ladies and gentlmen.

01:04:32.596 --> 01:04:34.179
Achtung, achtung.

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:38.208
We're already behind schedule,

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.757
and we haven't even started yet.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.548
If you think that I am here

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:45.743
as just another pretty face,

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.538
when we are finished you will know better.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.508
Under my watchful eye we, yes we,

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:55.503
will do the impossible,

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.163
and produce a wonderful film.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.608
Miss Hathaway, Mister
Gulman, forgive me.

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:12.038
The mayor and I have a big surprise

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.498
before we start our
first day of rehearsal.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.748
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.318
it has always been my pleasure

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.308
on the first day of a new picture,

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.198
to do something very special.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.438
And I think you will all agree

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.448
that this one belongs
on the top of the heap.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:26.898
He is a writer, a producer, a director,

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.688
and he's America's favorite cowboy,

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:31.278
and he has taken time to lead the way

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.898
for Bill Tilghman and the Outlaws,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.678
and tomorrow he is
returning to California,

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.358
where he is going to star

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.978
in his next epic film, "Hell's Hinges."

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:44.954
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mister William Surrey Hart.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.308
Thank you, Mister Selig,

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:22.678
you know I love the
art of making pictures.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.583
It is like breath of life to me.

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.118
Herr Hart has made his country proud.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.090
And together, we will keep
the west alive forever.

01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:35.759
Make the west live for us all.

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:41.225
Adios amigos,

01:06:41.227 --> 01:06:44.458
God bless you all, each and every one.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.910
The remarkable man of
the west, William S Hart.

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:05.633
All right, that was exciting,

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.398
but as I was saying,

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.008
over the next 10 days,

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:15.338
we are going to plan and execute

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.968
a daring robbery,

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:22.488
a dangerous chase, a deadly shootout,

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:27.490
and culminating will be a dramatic trial

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:31.808
of some of the most nefarious desperadoes

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.763
to ever stalk the west.

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:37.958
In order to accomplish this,
before we are finished,

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.548
you will be poked, you will be prodded,

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:44.128
you will wallow in the dirt.

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:46.868
You will be so exhausted
when you go home at night,

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:48.918
you'll just drop dead in your bed.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.968
But you will get up the next morning,

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:53.460
and you will be here at six a.m.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:57.775
Right.

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:26.644
Hello gentlemen.

01:10:26.646 --> 01:10:27.477
Mister James.

01:10:27.479 --> 01:10:29.393
I'm here to see Murphy and Cole Younger.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:31.873
Thank you.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.658
Okay, I need you to both try
these on before I hem 'em up.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.088
Ah come on Frank,
we're all tuckered out.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:44.254
Can't we do this tomorrow?

01:10:44.256 --> 01:10:45.838
Quit your bellyachin' okay?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.940
I need you to put these on, you too Murph.

01:10:51.182 --> 01:10:53.458
Listen, I got a really
bad feelin' about this.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.668
There's a hundred people,

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:57.118
all it takes is one of
them to upset the cart.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.288
Besides, I got a lot more to
lose than the both of you.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.948
Come on, Frank.

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.968
It's a cakewalk.

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:06.108
Look, by the end of tomorrow,

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.733
we will know every move.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.628
Yeah, and in addition to that,

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:14.403
we will have the only guns that bark.

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:16.423
Where'd you?

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.373
What about me?

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:21.610
Now I don't want a
slaughterhouse, Murphy.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.208
But I do want you and your
men to disarm the guards.

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.208
Now, be out of sight,

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:28.493
so easy pickin's.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.058
Then, you all have their guns.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.238
But Murphy, you spill a drop of blood,

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.028
and I'll stop your clock myself.

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:41.498
All right, all right,
Cole, we'll play it your way,

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.368
but I want Tilghman.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.668
He's mine.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.928
I'll fill Joe and his brood in tomorrow,

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:49.113
but I'm leaving the kid out of it.

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:51.668
Now he'd cave for sure.

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:54.298
Besides, he's so moon-eyed
over that producer's daughter

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.488
that we can't trust him.

01:11:57.490 --> 01:12:01.828
But the director has him
holdin' the desperadoes'

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:04.608
getaway horses right
in front of the livery.

01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:07.178
What more could we want, right?

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.958
We'll go, we'll grab the horses,

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.958
beat it out of town, leave
the kid scratchin' his head.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.988
And what about my share?

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:15.273
How do I get my share?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.968
Check that barrel in front
of the livery, it'll be there.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.473
But Murphy, something to chew on.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.958
Grab the money and hightail it.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.318
Save Tilghman for another day.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.093
Let him play the fool for a while.

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:33.578
I'll play that hand as it's dealt.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.388
You know by the time
I'm done with you two,

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:38.073
you'll be on the cover of
the Saturday Evening Post.

01:13:22.335 --> 01:13:23.968
It's quieter today, Marshal.

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.803
For now.

01:13:27.424 --> 01:13:28.988
Good morning, Marshal.

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.823
Morning.

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.358
It's quiet around here now,

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.060
but all hell'll break out shortly.

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.620
You see anything different?

01:13:39.524 --> 01:13:42.128
I'm lucky if I can
see anything these days.

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.653
Well, someone pilfered by cannon.

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.533
Pilfered?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.688
After all these years?

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:51.523
Reckon so.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:54.363
Kids.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.323
To tell you the truth,

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.690
I wish you would have
never started all this.

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:11.298
Action.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.058
Moving pictures demand action.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.338
You will remember that.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:19.498
Mister James and Mister
Younger will enter the bank,

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.008
and they will be watching all of you

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.510
to make sure that there's
no trouble with the law.

01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:27.978
Mister Little Joe, and Mister Big Joe,

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.598
you will be standing next to the bank.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.891
Mister James will toss you
money when he passes by,

01:14:33.893 --> 01:14:36.418
then you will run, pants on fire,

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.428
shooting your guns in the air.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:42.688
Mister Murphy, you and your
men will stand on your marks,

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.938
waiting to create a big noise,

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.418
to clear the streets with lots of smoke.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.248
Mister Cherokee, do not
look into the camera.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.338
Nobody look into the camera lens,

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.458
you will ruin my shot.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.538
Mister Chicken, you will be at the stable,

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.868
holding horses,

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.498
ready for the getaway.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.138
Now, Mister Goldstein will
stumble out of the bank,

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.143
yelling, they're robbing the
bank, they're robbing the bank!

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.668
Mister Murphy, you will
shoot at Mister Goldstein,

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:15.958
and he will fall back into the bank.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.108
This is the cue for Mister
James or Mister Younger

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:21.663
to run out of the bank, guns blazing.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.128
Across town, Marshal
Tilghman with his deputies

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:28.030
will come running.

01:15:29.113 --> 01:15:31.055
Mister Murphy, you will then
shoot at Marshal Tilghman,

01:15:31.057 --> 01:15:33.058
and you will miss.

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.688
Marshal Tilghman will then shoot at you,

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:36.613
and he won't miss.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.873
I like that part.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:43.653
What if I don't cotton to
gettin' shot by the Marshal?

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.324
Don't worry, Mister Murphy.

01:15:47.326 --> 01:15:48.576
It's just a picture show.

01:17:11.862 --> 01:17:14.647
They're robbing the bank.

01:17:14.649 --> 01:17:16.732
They're robbing the bank.

01:17:29.963 --> 01:17:31.047
They're robbin' the bank.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:32.598
They're robbin' the bank.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.321
They're robbin' the bank.

01:17:34.323 --> 01:17:35.697
They're robbin' the bank.

01:18:47.948 --> 01:18:50.448
No, the hat stays, for sure.

01:18:52.734 --> 01:18:54.718
You know Sweetheart I've
been watching you with

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.888
that convict they call Chicken Man.

01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:58.888
Daddy, the charges that
got John put in prison

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:00.128
are just a lot of nonsense.

01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:01.528
Yeah, I know, even the warden said

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:03.633
he didn't think the boy
deserved to be there.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.323
Regardless,

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.017
what do you see in him?

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:11.168
Daddy, he's sweet,

01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:14.428
kind, he would like more than anything

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.378
to get his mother and his little brothers,

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.678
and start a new life somewhere,

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.803
maybe raise a family.

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:24.695
Girl, what are you hopin'
this is gonna lead to?

01:19:24.697 --> 01:19:25.797
I don't really know,

01:19:27.618 --> 01:19:29.318
but I like that he makes me laugh.

01:19:31.977 --> 01:19:34.243
You know Sweetheart, I've
already lost your mother.

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.730
I just couldn't bear
to lose you too, okay?

01:19:42.383 --> 01:19:43.216

about our town today,

and you see men who have made
bad choices in their lives,

I'm gonna need you to move inside

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:56.088
until you hear multiple gunshots,

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:57.928
at which point you're
gonna come out of the jail,

01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:00.428
and run down the street towards the bank.

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:01.261
Around that corner.

01:23:01.263 --> 01:23:02.368
Round the corner that way.

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:03.648
I'm gonna need you to run right past

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:05.468

able to run around there?

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:09.408
We'll see.

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:10.243
Any questions?

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.848
Is my tie straight?

01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:14.218
Your tie looks great.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.628
All right, ready gentlemen?

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:16.463
Let's move.

01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:28.441
Action!

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:35.624
Cut!

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.693
Are you excited?

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.618
Mister Russell.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.870
Time to go on the horses.

01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:49.718
Well, nothin' too special
about holding the horses.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.148
Just wait until the dramatic chase,

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:55.313
galloping horses, roaring guns.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.610
When's that supposed to be?

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.033
In a couple of days.

01:24:02.423 --> 01:24:04.073
Wish it were a couple of weeks.

01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:06.095
A couple of weeks?

01:24:07.896 --> 01:24:09.953
I spent as much time
with you as I could.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.283
John Russell, you're not suggesting?

01:24:17.395 --> 01:24:19.094
I ain't suggesting nothin'.

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:20.213
Well what are you saying?

01:24:21.581 --> 01:24:23.031
Mister Russell, time to go.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.880
I'm very interested in
hearing what you have to say.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.118
They're robbing the bank!

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.020
Good good, now come down your steps.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.673
Go with God.

01:25:07.917 --> 01:25:11.356
Put the basket right on top over here.

01:25:21.979 --> 01:25:23.146
No no no no.

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:04.891
Action!

01:26:10.218 --> 01:26:11.218
Now?

01:26:12.608 --> 01:26:13.441
Yeah.

01:27:05.244 --> 01:27:07.077
This is so exciting.

01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:10.368
Gentlemen, please give us a minute

01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.118
while we reset the cameras.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.518
Mister Goldstein, remember your cue

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.798
is when you hear the word, action.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.848
Mister James, Mister Younger,

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:22.068
your cue is when Gulman yells, now.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.323
You exit the bank, guns blazing.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.903
My part's coming up.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.383
You know what you're supposed to do?

01:27:45.301 --> 01:27:47.468
You're robbin' the bank.

01:27:49.052 --> 01:27:51.052
You're robbin' the bank.

01:27:53.865 --> 01:27:55.948
They're robbin' the bank.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.918
Everyone, please stay
right where you are.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.018
Once the robbers exit the bank,

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:06.858
there will be gunfire.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:10.173
All the rest of the outlaws,
start shooting as well.

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:13.273
Hurry up and wait.

01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:16.113
It's an expression.

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.833
Mister Murphy.

01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:28.430
I'll only be a minute.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.573
You forget your place, Murphy?

01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:45.738
No Cole, I'm right where
I meant to be all along.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.548
This is not part of the plan Murphy.

01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:50.173
Yeah well there's been
a slight change in plans.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.713
No need to go there, Cole.

01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:01.563
Now what is your name?

01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:04.180
Mordecai Goldstein.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.433
My friends call me Mort.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:12.323
Mort, well I want you to do me a favor.

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:15.528
A favor?

01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:16.480
What kind of favor?

01:29:17.705 --> 01:29:19.283
In case you haven't figured it out,

01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:21.833
these are real son.

01:29:25.555 --> 01:29:27.155
Now I want you to take this bag,

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.493
go to that safe and
fill it with real money.

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.130
I forgot the combination.

01:29:49.745 --> 01:29:52.080
Does that help you to remember?

01:29:52.082 --> 01:29:52.913
Murphy.

01:29:52.915 --> 01:29:54.018
Easy Cole.

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.073
Let this play out.

01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:00.710
Just here in a minute gentlemen.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:06.973
Sorry Mort.

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:34.933
See?

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.153
Nothin's changed.

01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:03.967
Mort, it wasn't meant
to happen like this.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.380
I don't like this.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.418
Just stick with the plan.

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.465
Now when Pepper cuts
loose, head for the horses.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:14.238
By the time the dust clears,

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.441
we'll be halfway to Pine Ridge.

01:31:16.443 --> 01:31:17.276
Action!

01:31:19.002 --> 01:31:20.783
That's your cue, you're up.

01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:36.751
They're robbin' the bank.

01:31:36.753 --> 01:31:38.650
They're robbin' the bank.

01:31:38.652 --> 01:31:40.665
They're robbin' the bank.

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:42.750
They're robbin' the bank!

01:31:46.163 --> 01:31:47.211
Good.

01:31:47.213 --> 01:31:48.213
I like that.

01:31:52.163 --> 01:31:53.128
Murphy clipped him.

01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:54.796
He'll be all right.

01:31:54.798 --> 01:31:55.922
Now just stay here and
keep your head down,

01:31:55.924 --> 01:31:57.278
and you won't get it blown off.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.508
I'll wait here sir.

01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:00.628
Thank you Mister Younger.

01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:01.463
Now!

01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:06.368
Game's afoot, my friend.

01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:07.820
Watch out for Murphy, Cole.

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:27.874
That's wonderful.

01:32:32.609 --> 01:32:34.266
Wonderful.

01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:30.363
Zoe, get the boys and
Mama out here, go go!

01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:52.045
You boys lay flat.

01:33:52.047 --> 01:33:53.550
Okay Mama, it's okay.

01:33:53.552 --> 01:33:55.469
Go on, stay back there.

01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:09.653
Let's go boys.

01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:17.542
Bill?

01:34:42.042 --> 01:34:42.875
Cut.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.058
Sorry Bill.

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:41.938
I hoped we could find a way to stop this,

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:43.240
but it's all gone too far.

01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:47.518
You see Murphy, he's mad dog mean.

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.023
Cole, he's still looking for
something that never was.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.450
It's all complicated.

01:35:56.710 --> 01:36:00.373
Anyway, I've gotten as close
the good book as I can.

01:36:02.948 --> 01:36:05.098
You do what you gotta do, Joe.

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:07.038
But this ain't the end of it.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.668
Where's Murphy?

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:11.603
Little Joe, fetch me
one of them long guns.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.038
That's if Murphy's foolish
enough to stick around town.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.303
Bar the door, hurry, before Ma leaves us.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.238
Pepper sure got their attention,

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.448
and our horses are out back.

01:36:45.450 --> 01:36:46.721
I say it's time to get out of here.

01:36:46.723 --> 01:36:47.598
Give us our share, we'll slap leather.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.718
No no, I need you to
hold on for a few minutes,

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.868
and keep these street clear.

01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:53.478
I got unfinished business.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.313
Why should we?

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.628
Just stick around you can have my share.

01:36:58.630 --> 01:37:01.563
But I need you to nail
anything that moves.

01:37:07.983 --> 01:37:09.150
Here, fools!

01:37:10.226 --> 01:37:11.393
Get over here!

01:37:13.386 --> 01:37:14.553
Joe, come on.

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.015
Joe, Joe!

01:37:20.757 --> 01:37:23.678
Get moving, get in the back, Joe!

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.623
You're okay.

01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:30.280
Go around the corner.

01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:32.423
Stick close.

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:47.751
Malachi you all right?

01:37:47.753 --> 01:37:48.586
Sure Pa.

01:37:49.437 --> 01:37:51.901
All hell's broken loose out there.

01:37:51.903 --> 01:37:54.753
The one they call Big Joe
has put Bill in his own jail.

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:04.853
Boys, stay away from the window.

01:38:49.725 --> 01:38:50.810
Look who I found runnin' around.

01:38:50.812 --> 01:38:52.218
Frankie, Frankie thank God your safe.

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.820
Stay with Mama.

01:38:53.822 --> 01:38:54.834
What the hell's goin' on out there?

01:38:54.836 --> 01:38:55.667
I don't know.

01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:56.500
But you can sure bet that

01:38:56.502 --> 01:38:58.340
that lunatic Murphy is behind this.

01:39:04.172 --> 01:39:06.505
Where are Tench and Malachi?

01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:10.145
Those boys don't have the
brains God gave a gopher.

01:39:10.147 --> 01:39:10.980
Woody.

01:39:25.536 --> 01:39:26.647
Pa.

01:39:26.649 --> 01:39:28.399
Get us out of here.

01:39:31.736 --> 01:39:33.547
The stove.

01:39:33.549 --> 01:39:34.716
Right there.

01:39:35.762 --> 01:39:38.318
We just saw the sons getting away.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.098
They were riding away, in like a truck.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.248
Looked like that old lady was drivin'.

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:44.263
Come on, hurry up.

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.413
Tench?

01:39:51.477 --> 01:39:52.850
Tench!

01:39:52.852 --> 01:39:53.683
Malachi.

01:39:53.685 --> 01:39:54.730
Go check the livery.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.218
You can't be that stupid.

01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.553
You were weeks away from being a free man.

01:40:04.795 --> 01:40:05.626
We could have had...

01:40:05.628 --> 01:40:06.998
Oh calm down Missy.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.647
Stupid goes without sayin'.

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:11.348
The fact of the matter is,

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:14.318
Mister Russell here was
ignorant of the plot.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.608
Well if he hadn't have been,

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:17.808
perhaps he'd have done a better job

01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.768
of holding our horses.

01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:21.238
It wasn't my fault, they
just spooked and ran away.

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.848
Oh, what's left in the livery?

01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:27.218
I don't know, one
old mule and 50 chickens.

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.433
Family reunion.

01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.903
Cover me.

01:41:07.214 --> 01:41:09.476
You boys stay here.

01:41:38.730 --> 01:41:40.580
Find the Joes, they're headin' north.

01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:46.051
Frank,

01:41:46.053 --> 01:41:47.503
I don't know where this leaves us.

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.600
Ah hell.

01:41:51.078 --> 01:41:55.203
I'll just tell 'em I forced
you to go along with the plan.

01:41:58.978 --> 01:42:00.833
My life's not gonna change.

01:42:02.428 --> 01:42:04.178
And I'm not carryin' any more lead.

01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:08.220
There they are.

01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:33.289
No don't, don't.

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:35.825
No no no don't.

01:43:44.127 --> 01:43:46.210
What'd you do that for?

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:55.973
Cole.

01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:58.920
Hell, what's one more?

01:44:05.561 --> 01:44:08.428
Now Bill, it seems that
we are rather ill-equipped

01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:12.713
to continue this impersonal exchange.

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.097
Shall we settle this, just you and me?

01:44:26.047 --> 01:44:26.964
Bill, no.

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:03.023
I'm not nearly done with you.

01:46:50.607 --> 01:46:52.792
Oh Bill, the smell of vengeance.

01:47:59.257 --> 01:48:00.638
Why'd you do it Murphy?

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.883
You had no chance.

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.050
I needed to be free, Marshal.

01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:07.563
Kill you,

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:10.234
kill me.

01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:14.723
Either way, I'm free.

01:48:17.537 --> 01:48:18.537
Damnation.

01:48:23.314 --> 01:48:24.147
Big Joe,

01:48:26.051 --> 01:48:27.301
said maybe not.

01:48:44.174 --> 01:48:45.174
It's over.

01:48:47.274 --> 01:48:48.107
It's over.

01:49:08.749 --> 01:49:10.416
It ain't worth it.

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:14.703
Tilghman,

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:23.220
for the record, let's say Frank
had nothing to do with this.

01:50:23.301 --> 01:50:26.793
Oh, this one's bitin' me pretty bad.

01:50:29.077 --> 01:50:31.208
I saw what you did, Cole.

01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:32.243
I won't forget it.

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.363
Another Cole Younger tale.

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:40.228
Full of sound and fury,

01:50:40.230 --> 01:50:41.673
signifying nothing.

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.173
Let's get him to the doc.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.033
I didn't know.

01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:04.833
Well, I guess they ran out of gas.

01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:08.130
Look what we brought you, Marshal.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.378
It's hard to believe
they left this behind.

01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:12.533
Yeah, it's a mystery.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.140
They were nowhere to be found.

01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:20.298
You just can't seem to keep yourself

01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.593
out of trouble, can you?

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.337
Ain't likely.

01:51:27.704 --> 01:51:29.029
Melody, how are you?

01:51:29.031 --> 01:51:30.339
I'm fine.

01:51:30.341 --> 01:51:31.172
Where were you?

01:51:31.174 --> 01:51:32.468
I wanted to make sure
that John was all right.

01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:33.496
I'm sorry I didn't mean

01:51:33.498 --> 01:51:34.329
- to frighten you.
- I told her

01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:35.162
not to go after me.

01:51:35.164 --> 01:51:36.473
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:51:53.691 --> 01:51:57.858
Tilghman, I told you I'd
make you a star, right?

01:52:07.514 --> 01:52:10.302
It has a mind of its own.

01:56:07.997 --> 01:56:09.828
You know I've been thinkin'.

01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:11.318
Yeah?

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.570
Well don't hurt yourself.

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.104
I think there's a future
in these movin' pictures.

01:56:17.939 --> 01:56:19.373
No no no no.

01:56:19.375 --> 01:56:20.873
It's just a gust of wind.

01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:23.703
We ain't seen nothin' yet.

01:56:26.124 --> 01:56:26.957
Naa.
