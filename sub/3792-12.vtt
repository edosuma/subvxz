01:41.852 --> 01:44.604
- ARl: Wow.
- Three years and a 14-hour flight,

01:44.688 --> 01:46.481
we've finally arrived.
Pretty amazing.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.066
Jumping on the bandwagon
a little last minute, Suit.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.736
Nah, he's being positive
and I appreciate it.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.572
But the big question is,
can he stay positive the whole time?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.324
ARl: I am positive he cannot.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.909
Come on, guys,
let's give him a chance.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.620
He had his chances all year.
We should've left him in the States.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.538
Why does it feel like you did?

02:02.623 --> 02:06.000
The thing about negativity, E,
is it breeds bad outcomes.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.544
- I begged you to watch "The Secret. "
- I watched "The Secret. "

02:08.628 --> 02:11.047
I don't buy that you can get
a Ferrari by just wishing for one.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.132
I wished for an Aston Martin
and got me one.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.383
Vince got you one, Turtle.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.177
Yeah, but I wished
Vince would be a big enough star

02:16.261 --> 02:17.553
so he could afford to get me one.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.638
Thanks, Turtle.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.931
ARl: It doesn't matter
what any of you wish

02:20.015 --> 02:21.641
because you are
with the master of the universe

02:21.725 --> 02:24.811
and he will deliver a sale of
"Medellin" not to be believed.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.729
- I sure hope so.
No need to hope, Vince.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.440
This film will sell itself.
Ari will be nothing more

02:29.525 --> 02:32.151
than a marionette that
shakes his head yes or no,

02:32.236 --> 02:33.986
or says "double your offer. "

02:34.071 --> 02:36.531
- Do you believe that, E?
- I do, Vince. I do believe it.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.866
No, I need you to believe it.
Don't lie to me.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.994
I need you to really believe
that this movie's good and will sell.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.163
- I do!
- Do you believe him?

02:44.248 --> 02:45.456
No!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.210
- Nice!
Oh yeah!

02:49.294 --> 02:52.463
Bonjour. We're checking in
under the Vincent Chase party.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.091
Except for me. I'm under
my own party... Johnny Chase.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.553
Johnny...
- They loved "Viking Quest" in France.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.930
What the hell is "Viking Quest"?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.392
Is that the "Medellin" crew
I spot coming into my city?

03:04.476 --> 03:05.726
Jesus, where's the wife?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.019
Ari, how are you?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.522
- Good to see you.
- Vincent Chase!

03:09.606 --> 03:11.566
- Yair, how are you?
- Me? I'm hot.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.360
Not as hot as you. "Medellin"...
it is the talk of the festival.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.070
- Yeah, well...
- Feeling good about it?

03:16.154 --> 03:20.116
Good? This film is the best film in
the history of this film festival.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.493
You could have produced it, Yair.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.704
It's going to be one of the
great regrets of your life.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.872
He's feeling confident.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.082
As he should.
- Well, I am here to buy a movie, guys.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.376
And my pockets, they are deep.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.588
We're sorry, but we're here to sell
to Americans so that people can see

03:33.672 --> 03:36.257
"Medellin" in the States,
not in the Arab Emirates.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.552
Don't underestimate me, Ari.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.180
I'm making big moves. Why don't you
and the guys join me on my boat

03:43.265 --> 03:45.558
for a fabulous soiree
and I'll tell you all about it?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.728
We'd love to but we're going to go
to Brad and Angelina's boat today.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.313
They're throwing a party
this afternoon.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.565
That was yesterday, Ari.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.067
I get the feeling you boys
are blowing me off, yes?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.110
No.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.945
I mean, if it's my wife
you are concerned about,

03:58.030 --> 03:59.864
Vincent, she's not here.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.741
- No.
- We are through.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.160
See, that's my new girl over there.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.204
Trust me,
I'd never let you fuck her, huh?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.249
No, it's not that.
It's just we're tired from the trip.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.375
We have photo op in an hour.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.419
You should come to the
screening tomorrow, Yair.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.754
If he can get a ticket.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.255
What do you mean
you sold out?

04:16.339 --> 04:19.341
I'm Johnny Chase.
I booked this months ago.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.177
Check again.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.431
- Fucking French cocksuckers.
- This is like Sundance all over again.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.600
- Can he stay with E, Vince, please?
- I'm not staying with E.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.268
- No, you're not.
- You're not staying with me.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.771
- I'm not staying with anybody.
Sleep on the sand.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.814
They said they'd have a room
for you in a couple of hours.

04:33.899 --> 04:34.899
Just relax, guys.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.275
They'd better because
I've been dreaming

04:36.360 --> 04:39.445
about this trip for months,
picturing myself out on my balcony,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.113
overlooking...

04:41.365 --> 04:42.323
What's that water they got out here?

04:42.407 --> 04:43.449
Perrier.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.451
- The Mediterranean.
- The Mediterranean.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.244
Me and some
French beauty locked up in our own

04:47.329 --> 04:49.288
"Last Tango in Paris" kind of way,

04:49.373 --> 04:51.499
living off Dom Perignon
and profiteroles

04:51.708 --> 04:53.501
and doing nothing but fucking.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.795
You can't find
anyone to fuck in L.A., Drama.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.005
What makes you think you're
gonna find someone here?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.007
Because I'm a celebrity
out here, Billy.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.926
Uh, you're a celebrity in L.A., Johnny.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.054
Not like France.
In France, I'm a Viking god.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.014
"A Viking god"?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.809
You doubt that?
Check French Amazon's top sellers.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.895
"Viking Quest" has been on there
as long as "Dark Side of the Moon. "

05:13.897 --> 05:17.024
Well, even Jerry Lewis
gets pussy here, so who knows?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.985
Monsieur Chase,
this is your room right here.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.194
This is incredible.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.946
Wow, they all this big?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.364
Four in a row, all identical,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.825
- all with this view.
Unreal!

05:27.077 --> 05:29.203
Fucking French cocksuckers.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.497
What's the matter, Lloyd,
you and Tom want to listen

05:31.581 --> 05:33.165
to my voice while you dildo each other?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.167
No, I have
Nicky Rubenstein for you.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.712
Tell him you're on a cruise
with your very own king of the world

05:37.796 --> 05:41.340
and have him call me direct.
Can I get a Nutella, please?

05:41.425 --> 05:43.259
- Are you eating crepes, Ari?
- No.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.427
Walk away, Ari Gold.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.554
You know you can't wheel
and deal with a big fat belly.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.556
- I need energy, Lloyd.
- Okay, okay.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.684
Nicky, you're on with Ari.
Ari, you have Nicky.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
Lower, Tom, lower!

05:53.603 --> 05:54.979
Oh! Ohh-hhh.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.065
- Hey, Ari.
- Nicky Rubenstein,

05:58.150 --> 06:00.067
how's my favorite
stay-at-home convict?

06:00.152 --> 06:02.403
Well, I'm not there
so how the fuck do you think I am?

06:02.487 --> 06:04.822
Why don't you rip off that anklet,
hop on a plane?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.158
You still have time
to make it before the screening.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.869
Right. The judge won't even let me
remove it to get rid of this rash.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.371
Ew!
- So I just got a call from Yair Marx.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.456
And?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.541
And he would love to tell you all
about his new company.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.001
It's a waste of time, Nicky.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.253
You got something better
to do Ari, or?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.756
Yeah. Vince wants to find
some French models to undress.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.300
I didn't pay for you to go down there
to have a fucking vacation.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.802
Yair Marx is not a real buyer.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.095
Well, his money's real.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.556
And until you find a realer one,
I suggest you go over there

06:30.640 --> 06:31.891
and listen to everything he has to say.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.726
- Nicky!
- Ari, I would've hired a sales rep

06:33.810 --> 06:35.186
if I thought you were gonna
be a pain in the ass.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.854
- Nicky, listen to me...
- Shut the fuck up, Ari!

06:36.938 --> 06:39.023
This is my thing, okay? I'm in charge.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.400
So get your ass over
to the party with Vince and Walsh

06:41.485 --> 06:42.526
before I pull my credit card

06:42.611 --> 06:44.653
and you guys are paying
for your own incidentals!

07:03.465 --> 07:06.550
Look at all the girls.
This might not be so bad after all.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.385
If I had a room
it would be phenomenal.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.428
You know what, Drama?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.098
You get a girl, you can have
my room till yours is ready.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.682
Or mine.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.684
Okay, hotshots, give me your keys.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.686
Just know, once I go in,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.022
- I ain't coming back out.
- Oh-hhh!

07:20.107 --> 07:21.816
Get the girl first, all right?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.692
- Then we'll talk.
- All right.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.196
- Hi. You're Tarvold.
- That's right.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.742
Come dance, Tarvold.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.744
- The keys, Turtle, keys.
- Fuck that, Tarvold.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.038
So this is Cannes, huh?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.290
Hanging out with a bunch
of freaky Eurotrash?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.959
- E's being negative, Vince.
- Shut up.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.753
Ah, the boys have arrived.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.006
Thank you for coming.
We have caviar, Cristal,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.717
and all the longest legs
in France, huh?

07:49.511 --> 07:50.636
You like?

07:50.720 --> 07:54.390
You know, I'm kind of an ass man,
myself, but they'll do.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.850
Genevieve, Genevieve.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.645
You take this man down
to the guest bedroom,

07:59.729 --> 08:01.105
you give him your best blowjob, huh?

08:01.690 --> 08:04.400
A thousand thanks.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.319
Now we men will go down
to my stateroom

08:07.404 --> 08:08.779
and we talk.

08:11.283 --> 08:15.035
- I'm gonna get my balls licked later.
- Can't help you there, Billy.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.462
ARl: What's going on, Yair?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.256
I want an early look
at your movie, huh?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.674
I want to see it before everyone else.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.428
Hey, if I like what I see I pay big money.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.554
Everyone's going to like
what they see

08:33.638 --> 08:35.472
and everyone's going
to pay big money, so stand in line.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.267
No one has the kind
of money that I have.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.311
I pay in euros.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.520
Raffi! Raffi! Bring in the gold.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.274
What's this?
- It's party favors.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.692
Open them.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.739
- Where's mine?
- You take 10% of Vince's.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.158
We appreciate this, Yair.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.243
But, uh, we can't accept these.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.704
I could accept it, but I got
a gold Rolex from my parents

08:58.788 --> 09:00.539
for high school graduation.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.416
But I love
that Patek Philippe you're rocking.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.126
You have a good eye, Mr. Walsh.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.004
Tell you what,
you show me your movie, it is yours.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.172
Never happen.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.507
Yair, we waited three months
for tomorrow night.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.426
There's no way we can show it early.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.012
Ari, please tell these boys
how much money I have.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.640
Uh, too much, but
what you don't have is distribution.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.391
Ahhh, I do now.

09:20.018 --> 09:24.021
I am announcing it tomorrow.
I am sinking 100 mil into a new outlet.

09:24.105 --> 09:28.025
I hired the head of Pixar marketing...
you know the girl who did "Nemo"?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.611
I love that fish. I am very real

09:31.363 --> 09:33.822
and I want "Medellin" to be
my first real acquisition.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.616
We'll talk tomorrow
after you watch the movie.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.034
Is there no way
I can change your mind?

09:37.118 --> 09:39.620
Not unless you still have
the Mossad on retainer.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.665
Sorry, Yair.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.833
Would you be offended if I sold this?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.335
Ah, never mind.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.255
$20 million.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.383
What?
- I offer $20 million

09:52.467 --> 09:54.260
sight unseen,
we announce it tomorrow.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.262
- Yair...
- $25 million.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.181
- Yair, our budget was 35 million.
- 35 then.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.433
I am not playing games.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.186
I give you till before the
screening to give me an answer.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.232
Oh, Mr. Walsh...
for your consideration.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.075
That's amazing.
I didn't even know that episode aired

10:18.159 --> 10:19.994
'cause we got canceled
in the middle of shooting it.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.329
It aired here.
I must have seen it 100 times.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.873
- 100? Come on.
- I'm not exaggerating.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.667
My whole family,
especially my father,

10:26.751 --> 10:28.794
was obsessed with "Viking Quest. "

10:28.878 --> 10:33.257
At 9:00 P.M. Every Thursday,
he'd yell...

10:33.341 --> 10:34.800
- Really?
- Oui!

10:34.884 --> 10:38.012
He even bought my brother the
uniform that you donned on the show

10:38.096 --> 10:39.471
for his birthday one year.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.266
And he'd wear it so proudly,
even though...

10:42.517 --> 10:44.768
his muscles were not as big as yours.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.689
- That's amazing.
- Amazing is meeting you,

10:48.773 --> 10:50.733
- here.
- Yeah.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.943
So shall we go back to your hotel?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.739
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Well, if we wait about...

10:57.157 --> 10:59.491
30 minutes and then
walked really slow,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.160
my room should be ready.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.291
Can he really write that check, Ari?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.334
Yair won't write a check.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.045
He'll deliver cash
in multiple duffle bags.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.505
Does everyone get
a bag like the watch?

11:13.590 --> 11:16.717
- Turtle, I think you've had enough.
- I do feel good, Vince.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.677
Look, nobody's getting
anything from the guy.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.429
I want to sell to a studio,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.598
a studio that's known
for winning Oscars.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.682
I agree.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.185
- But it is a good offer, no?
E, I mean...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.771
Does nobody but me think
we should seriously consider this?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.023
No.
- It's a good money offer, yes,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.566
but do you really
want to be the guinea pig

11:32.650 --> 11:34.276
in this guy's
new distributing company?

11:34.361 --> 11:37.196
The guy's not gonna sink $35 million
into a movie and just let it die, Ari.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.031
- E, I know you're nervous...
E's not nervous,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.825
- he's a class-A pussy.
- A pussy?

11:41.910 --> 11:42.910
Nobody's seen the movie.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.745
We've got an offer
that can get us all our money back.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.872
- It's never been about the money.
- It became about that

11:46.956 --> 11:49.625
when we emptied our bank accounts
and put every dollar we had into it.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.876
Who cares about money?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.586
You didn't put any in,
so why would you, Billy?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.589
I told you I'd buy you out. Just say
the word and you'd have no risk.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.758
- And no reward.
- Is that what you want?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.968
E, in or out, it's up to you.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.971
I'm in. I'm in.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.183
You sure? You can come by
and shine up Vince's Oscar any time.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.560
- I'm in.
- Big balls for a little man, I love it.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.646
Let's call Nicky and see
if he's got them as well.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.572
- Please tell me my room is ready.
- But of course, Mr. Chase.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.990
Just like I said.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.373
Oh, Jacqueline,
you have a beautiful je ne sais quoi.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
And you are very funny.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.212
- Oui oui.
- I'm missing your funny face on TV.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.674
I have a new show now.
It hasn't hit France yet, but it will.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.760
- I cannot wait.
- This is it, Mr. Chase.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.513
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm supposed to be on the ocean side.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.974
Johnny, it's okay.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.858
Oh no, no, no, no, no. This is no good.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.818
- Is something wrong?
- Everything's wrong.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.864
There's no balcony, no view,
no room for a tray of profiteroles.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.159
But there is a bed, Johnny.
That's all we need.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.205
- Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.042
Come over here, you!

13:19.966 --> 13:21.425
What's wrong?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.553
I want this to be special,
really special.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.972
Give me five minutes.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.557
I'm gonna talk to the manager.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.809
- No. No.
- I'm gonna make it perfect.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.145
- Trust me.
- I trust you, Johnny.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.564
You're my Viking warrior.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.442
Back in five.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.068
Le victory!

13:40.403 --> 13:42.529
Oooh, you gave me chills.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.407
Back in a flash, ma cherie.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.912
Nicky, calm down. Jesus Christ!

13:49.996 --> 13:51.830
Hey, don't tell me
to fucking calm down, Ari.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.416
Listen, it's the first offer...
the first of many.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.752
- Yeah well, I wanna take it.
- No you don't.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.463
Yes, I do actually, Ari. I should have
taken Harvey's offer when you got it.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.256
No, you shouldn't and you
shouldn't take this one

14:01.341 --> 14:03.967
because Yair Marx
will fuck this movie up.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.386
What movie is that, Ari?
The movie my director won't

14:06.471 --> 14:08.597
let me see even though I sunk
$30 fucking million into it?

14:08.932 --> 14:11.266
What are you so panicked about?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.684
This is very stressful, Ari, okay?

14:12.769 --> 14:13.936
I've been sober for nearly a year

14:14.020 --> 14:15.896
which is not easy with
fucking enablers around!

14:15.980 --> 14:17.105
Party pooper.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.690
Plus I'm having some
financial difficulties.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.527
Like what, the cupholder
in your Bugatti is broken?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.196
No, I got smoked by this
cocksucker's hedge fund gone bad.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.740
I'm in really bad shape. If I don't get
my money out of this film,

14:26.824 --> 14:28.325
I'm going to have
to move to the fucking Valley.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.368
Ew.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.245
Can you two shut the fuck up?
I'm not paying you to talk.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.704
Nicky, trust me.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.207
- You will get other offers.
- How do you know?

14:35.291 --> 14:37.376
The same way I knew
your father was banging his secretary

14:37.460 --> 14:40.087
before everyone in town did:
Instinct. Nicky,

14:40.171 --> 14:43.131
trust me, baby, we will get better offers.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.217
Okay, Ari, you've got
until screening time

14:45.301 --> 14:46.426
to work this shit out, okay?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.303
Because I'm not taking
any fucking chances. Au revoir.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.429
I'm sorry I snapped.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.683
I'm an American citizen.
You can't treat me like this.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.560
Please, Mr. Chase, calm your voice.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.563
Don't tell me to calm down.
I booked this room three months ago,

14:57.647 --> 14:59.356
confirmed it a dozen times at least.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.359
But we have no record of it, and now
you want the honeymoon suite?

15:02.443 --> 15:04.486
- But I am afraid it is occupied.
- By who?

15:04.821 --> 15:07.281
Honeymooners. What does it matter?

15:07.365 --> 15:09.324
You would never treat
George Clooney this way.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.326
Ah, Monsieur Clooney...

15:11.619 --> 15:13.537
- film actor.
- Oh ho ho ho.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.249
- Keep pushing me, buddy.
- Are we finished here?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.043
- No, I want my suite!
- Well...

15:20.420 --> 15:22.504
there is nothing that
can be done about that.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.340
So why don't you stop
acting like a spoiled vulgar American

15:25.425 --> 15:27.009
and enjoy your stay?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.677
Fuck you.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.221
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me,

15:31.306 --> 15:33.515
you pompous French fuck. Fuck you!

15:34.517 --> 15:36.643
I would like you to leave my hotel
and never return.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.145
I'd like to see you make me.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.563
Hmph.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.692
Marcel, show
Monsieur Chase to the curb.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.236
Oh hey, get your fucking
hands off me.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.821
Okay okay okay.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.157
Let me just go up to my room
and get my girl, okay?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.200
Hey, someone go up to room 402,

15:52.368 --> 15:55.203
get my girl, tell her Tarvold
will be waiting for her.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.623
Get your hands off me...

16:01.669 --> 16:03.545
I am on vacation, Ari!

16:03.921 --> 16:07.174
You're going to be on permanent
vacation if we don't sell this movie.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.259
Now I want you to break out
your pink Rolodex,

16:09.344 --> 16:12.220
call every queer assistant
in town and tell them

16:12.305 --> 16:15.432
to open their mouths like J.T.
Is going to drop a load in it.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.393
The disinformation campaign
starts now.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.647
Time is of the essence.
I want you to hype this bitch!

16:22.273 --> 16:24.149
That's your genius plan, Ari?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.443
I got plenty of genius plans.
You guys just do your jobs.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.945
- What's that?
- To hype this movie in there

16:29.030 --> 16:31.031
like you got the next
"Pulp Fiction" and smile.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.992
Mr. Chase, Mr. Walsh.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.620
- ARl: I'll see you guys in there.
- And Mr?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.664
Uh, Murphy. I'm the producer.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.083
Oh.
We'll announce you in just a moment.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.090
Where's Jacqueline?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.717
- Did you go to the room?
- Oui...

16:50.802 --> 16:52.594
But mademoiselle, she wasn't there.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.805
- Yeah, but...
- Perhaps she has left.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.015
I've been waiting here the whole time...
I would've seen her.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.685
- Maybe she went out the back.
- This ain't the back?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.020
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm very sorry,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.106
but I must get back to work before
they see me speaking to you.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.403
What?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.378
Dana Gordon,
here supporting the family. I love it.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.548
- You saving a seat for me?
- Actually I was hoping

17:29.632 --> 17:31.550
we wouldn't have to speak
till after the screening.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.427
Unfortunately, we actually do.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.346
Why, what's up?

17:36.514 --> 17:40.308
Well, I'm only telling you this...
don't tell a soul.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.437
- We are selling "Medellin" tonight.
- Uh-huh.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.689
- No one's seen it.
- We have an offer.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.232
- From who?
- It doesn't matter.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.984
It's on the table and it's big.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.027
What are you trying to pull, Ari?

17:51.112 --> 17:52.571
I'm trying to make sure you don't lose

17:52.655 --> 17:54.656
the next Vinnie Chase-
Billy Walsh masterpiece.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.033
We don't buy movies
without seeing them.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.577
No, you just hire people off them.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.079
You don't really want
someone else in control of this thing

18:01.164 --> 18:02.581
while you're producing
"Clouds," do you?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.334
It's called "Silo" now,
Ari, or did you forget

18:06.419 --> 18:08.587
that that's the movie
your clients decided to make?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.756
Whatever.
Just tell your boss, all right?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.341
You're full of shit.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.386
I was full of shit when I told you
I had a condom at Live Aid,

18:16.512 --> 18:19.139
this, on my children's names, is real.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.850
Mesdames et messieurs,
ladies and gentlemen,

18:21.934 --> 18:24.352
the star and the creators
of "Medellin,"

18:24.687 --> 18:26.438
Monsieur Vincent Chase;

18:26.522 --> 18:29.191
Le realisateur... the director,
monsieur Billy Walsh;

18:29.525 --> 18:32.694
et le producteur...
the producer, monsieur Eric...

18:33.362 --> 18:34.696
Murphy. Eric Murphy.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.531
Eric Murphy. Pardon.

19:01.933 --> 19:02.933
Excusez-moi.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.976
- Oui.
- Do you know this girl?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.480
- Um, no. No.
- Maybe you've seen her.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.190
No, desolee.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.653
How about you ladies? Have you seen
this girl at all, by any chance?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.822
- No, but she's pretty.
- Sorry.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.031
Merci.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.325
Was that Tarvold?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.621
You guys killed it up there. I'm telling
you, it's only a matter of time

19:24.705 --> 19:25.997
before the offers start rolling in.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.082
You really believe that, Ari?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.209
I really believe it.
I believe in the power of positivity.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.920
I believe in "The Secret. "
Now will you please believe with me?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.422
Not since the Nazis
stormed these beaches

19:34.507 --> 19:38.468
has a bigger group of scumbags
muddied these clear blue waters.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.345
- How are you, Harvey?
- I'm well.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.181
I understand you guys have
a hot little property.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.267
- Well...
- I heard that you had an offer.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.018
Who did you hear that from?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.729
I have an assistant who
keeps his ear to the ground.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.440
- Who's it from, Universal?
- Can't really talk about that now.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.317
But if you want to get in the mix,
we're ready to listen.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.194
Not if they froze my balls in dry ice.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.613
Not if they stuck
my dick in a lawnmower.

19:58.948 --> 20:02.576
And you know why? It's not because
I don't think it might be a good movie,

20:02.660 --> 20:05.203
it's because I hate
this little fucking prick right here.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.872
This little fucking prick!

20:12.503 --> 20:14.045
What the fuck are you doing?

20:14.130 --> 20:18.008
I am just apologizing
for my man's indiscretion earlier

20:18.092 --> 20:20.260
- with a hug, that's it.
- I see. Okay, don't. Don't.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.803
I gotta get a drink
before I kill someone.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.556
All right, Harvey. All right.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.850
- What the hell was that?
- I'm just trying to pull

20:26.934 --> 20:28.435
a rabbit out of the hat for you,
Vinnie.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.355
Hello.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.650
Tomorrow morning,
10:00 A.M. At Le Gros Bison.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.652
I'll have an offer ready.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.405
Time to drink, boys.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.294
Excuse me. Yair?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.463
Hey, Johnny Chase.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.423
- Hey...
- Are you okay?

20:58.966 --> 21:02.135
Uh, not really, No.
I got evicted from the hotel.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.097
I don't have international calling
so I can't get ahold of Vince.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.975
And I somehow got separated from
the young lady I met on the boat.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.688
I was wondering if you knew where
she was, or if she came back here?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.399
- I've got a picture of her.
- Ah.

21:16.484 --> 21:20.111
- Her name is Jacqueline.
- No, I am sorry, I don't.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.448
Hey, hold on. Hey, any of you ladies,

21:23.532 --> 21:25.867
- do you know this girl?
- No. No.

21:26.827 --> 21:27.827
I'm sorry, Johnny.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.830
Thanks, Yair.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.127
You girls, excuse me for a moment.
Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Hold on.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.257
You pick. Any of these girls,
they are yours, huh?

21:42.051 --> 21:43.593
The one on the left... Cara,

21:43.678 --> 21:46.221
her pussy's as soft
as Patasi silk, huh?

21:46.764 --> 21:49.224
The short-haired one,
Nadia, she is a gymnast.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.852
She will hang upside down from the
ceiling as you tickle her asshole.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.814
Ah, Cecilia, she is my favorite.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.108
She has the best cans in Cannes.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.902
So you choose.
Whichever you wish, she is yours.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.948
Well, thanks, Yair,
but I don't need a girl,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.950
just a warm bed if you've got one.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.786
Of course I have one of those.
But, please,

22:09.870 --> 22:12.414
- take Cara too.
- Thanks, but really I can't.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.999
Why not?

22:15.751 --> 22:16.918
Because I'm in love.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.439
Can you feel the excitement?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.983
I've got offers and no one's
seen a single frame.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.234
Please.
Who hasn't done that, Ari?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.569
Yeah, but I will close.

22:42.653 --> 22:43.653
For how much?

22:43.738 --> 22:44.738
What do you think
she's gonna offer?

22:44.822 --> 22:46.865
I'm guessing 150 mil.
- What, are you retarded?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.199
You can get that, Ari, right?

22:48.284 --> 22:50.869
I like the faith, Turtle,
but not with Dana, naw.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.079
- She made me split the abortion.
- Jesus.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.915
Long as we get with a real studio,
with a real release,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.876
I don't care if we sell for five bucks.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.545
Well, Nicky Rubenstein
would care, trust me.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.340
He won't let us sell this thing for
one dollar less than Yair's offering.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.592
Then you'd better get her there, huh?

23:05.676 --> 23:06.718
Don't worry about that.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.512
Master of the universe, fellas.
Enjoy the ride.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.140
$15 million.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.810
15... I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet, but...

23:15.895 --> 23:17.645
15 mil? Come on,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.981
I didn't really cancel
my massage for this, did I, Dana?

23:20.066 --> 23:22.734
Your budget will be first to be
recouped upon the film's release.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.278
No way. We need much more up front.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.405
- But there is no more.
- Come on!

23:27.698 --> 23:29.449
You can do better than that.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.701
Richard doesn't really believe you
have another offer, Ari.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.745
So that's it. Take it or leave it.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.997
I'm sorry, but we're
gonna have to leave it.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.166
How much do you want, Ari?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.794
$50 mil.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.337
- 50?
- Yeah.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.340
Fuck you. Vince, Billy, E, I'm sorry.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.842
Come on, you just... are you kidding?

23:48.677 --> 23:50.553
All right, Dana, Dana.
Can I be honest with you?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.598
We do have another offer
on the table... 35 million...

23:53.682 --> 23:55.350
Exactly the budget of this movie.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.852
Nicky Rubenstein wants to take it
but we don't want to be in business...

23:57.937 --> 24:00.063
It doesn't matter who we don't
want to be in business with.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.440
Is it Harvey?
Because my assistant thinks it's Fox.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.818
Could be Fox,
could be Universal, could be Sony.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.278
Could be your old boss who kicked
you out on your ass, who knows?

24:07.363 --> 24:09.864
- Dana...
- Vince! It doesn't matter who,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.658
and that's all we're
gonna say about it.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.118
Except that we want
to do this with you, Dana.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.954
- We want to win Oscars.
- But Nicky, he wants his money back.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.665
- So I should be talking to him.
- ARl: I am him!

24:18.749 --> 24:21.292
Just get us a reasonable price.

24:21.377 --> 24:24.087
Okay, 50? That's reasonable?

24:26.590 --> 24:29.092
Look, just get our investors their
money back. That's all we want.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.552
It's not all I wanted.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.179
- Hello.
Hey, Turtle.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.056
Hey, Drama. What's up, buddy?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.558
Hey, you still holed up
with that little cutie?

24:36.642 --> 24:37.642
No.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.727
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.064
I just called to let you know I'm okay
and I'll see you at the screening.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.358
- Are you guys okay?
- We're great.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.111
Vince is about to sell the movie
to Dana Gordon for like 50 mil.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.155
Really? That's great. That's great.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.906
Give him a big hug for me.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.117
I'll see you
at the screening party. Later.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.744
Everybody hunky-dory, Johnny?

24:56.829 --> 25:00.707
Yeah, baby bro just got
a $50 million offer for his movie.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.335
All right.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.047
- I can go to 22.
- We have no room here, Dana.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.674
25.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.842
I thought you didn't have
any more money?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.594
28 and I swear to God I'm done.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.138
I'll go call Nicky.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.931
You get up from this table
and it's over.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.934
Look me in the face and say yes or no.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.437
We can't do it for less than 35,
Dana, we really can't.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.522
I don't have authorization
to spend that much.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.566
Then get your authorization
on the phone.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.944
Look, this is really awkward, guys.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.863
I mean we're gonna be
working together on the next movie

25:31.947 --> 25:33.323
and I'm at my limit.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.783
- I am sorry.
- I'll take my five million

25:35.868 --> 25:38.077
- after the movie turns a profit.
Me too.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.246
Well, my 237,000.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.373
Jesus, you guys are fucking crazy.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.042
That's how much
we believe in this, Dana.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.669
Come on, make up the difference.
It's less than two mil.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.464
It's not a lot. It's not a lot.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.557
- Done.
- Yeah.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.017
I can sell this to Richard.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.562
All right, but you gotta...
you gotta tell me.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.814
- Was it Harvey?
- ARl: Yes!

26:07.274 --> 26:09.609
- It was Harvey.
- Oh, I knew it!

26:11.570 --> 26:13.404
- Shall we get a drink?
- Yes, let's do it.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.324
- It'd be rude not to.
- Turtle's buying.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.160
Vin, you got the credit card?

26:20.162 --> 26:21.621
Nicky, my man, listen,

26:21.705 --> 26:23.206
I just got you a real studio offer

26:23.290 --> 26:25.500
that's gonna get you back
every dollar that you put in.

26:25.876 --> 26:26.918
That's terrific, Ari.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.795
I just got off the phone with Yair...

26:29.421 --> 26:31.047
who offered me 75.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.633
And I took it.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.721
Line me up some rails,
bitches, because we're celebrating!

26:38.889 --> 26:41.015
We did it.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.851
We fucking did it, Ari.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.021
Dana.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.274
Thank you. All right, cheers.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.817
Cheers.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.485
Dana Gordon.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.124
Drama, you've known her less
than a day. How can you love her?

27:06.208 --> 27:08.167
I've known her long enough
to know she doesn't have

27:08.252 --> 27:10.336
any of those things that would
make me not love her.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.213
It doesn't bother you
that she just wants to fuck you

27:12.298 --> 27:13.381
because you're a celebrity?

27:13.465 --> 27:14.799
No, I love it.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.010
Nobody's ever wanted to sleep
with me just 'cause I'm a celebrity.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.762
It makes me feel wanted and
validated all at the same time.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.764
So, are we all miserable?

27:21.849 --> 27:24.142
- Not in the slightest.
- We're actually relieved.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.769
- ARl: I'm relieved to hear it.
- I'm not relieved.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.439
If that slimy Middle Eastern
cocksucker fucks up this release

27:29.523 --> 27:31.316
I'll kill him and I'll kill you too, Ari.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.485
- Hey, Yair!
- Johnny!

27:34.695 --> 27:37.655
- Johnny!
- Jacqueline!

27:37.740 --> 27:40.366
Johnny, where were you?

27:40.451 --> 27:41.534
Hey, baby.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.995
I waited for you
all night at the hotel.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.997
- Where were you?
- I'm so sorry. I'll explain later.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.249
I knew this was the only
place I'd find you again.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.376
Come here.

27:58.761 --> 28:02.555
Everybody in for the movie
the world has been waiting for.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.200
So you're not upset that you're not
inside at your brother's screening?

29:04.910 --> 29:07.078
Naw, baby bro's all grown up now.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.580
He don't need me anymore.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.416
But I need you.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.251
Well, you have me.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.755
I wish I had a place to take you.
I've still got no room.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.966
It doesn't matter.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.677
There's no one around.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.391
Oooh, sexe sur la plage...

29:28.475 --> 29:29.809
I like it.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.971
I love it.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.569
Thanks for
not selling me this movie, Ari.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.905
It's the one
nice thing you've ever done for me.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.408
Congratulations, Yair.
I hear it's all yours.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.745
I never signed anything.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.039
What are you talking about?

30:33.457 --> 30:35.750
That's the worst
piece of shit I've ever seen!

30:35.834 --> 30:37.752
Yair, we have a deal, right?

30:38.212 --> 30:41.005
Sue me.
My company's based out of Dubai.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.758
Good luck.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.593
I'm sorry, Vince.

30:48.305 --> 30:51.933
Hey, where the fuck are you
French faggots going?!

30:52.726 --> 30:54.018
Show some respect

30:54.102 --> 30:57.438
for the below-the-line people
and watch the credits.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.607
What, no Q&A?

31:04.571 --> 31:06.322
It ain't easy making a movie, huh?

31:06.406 --> 31:08.199
- You come to gloat, Harvey?
- No, no.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.369
I just came to say that E was right.
There's genius in this.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.913
- You want to buy it?
- I do.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.624
For $1.

31:21.129 --> 31:24.549
So we lost $74,999,000.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.342
And $999.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.345
It's only money, you know?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.305
- And we still got Harvey.
Again.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.934
And for only
$24,999,000 less than when I had him.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.728
All I know is that Harvey is the guy
you want in this situation.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.188
You should have seen
"Shakespeare in Love"

31:39.273 --> 31:41.107
before he put his scissor hands on it.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.569
- So you think we're still good?
- I know we're all good.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.529
- Way to be positive.
- Oh please, come on.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.114
The guy's about as positive

31:48.198 --> 31:50.783
- as Mother Teresa's AIDS test.
Fuck you, Ari.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.370
Excuse me. What's happening?

31:54.454 --> 31:56.581
Tarvold from "Viking Quest"
has been making love

31:56.665 --> 31:58.541
to a woman on the beach
for three hours.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.170
Come on.
This I gotta see.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.012
Way to go, Drama!

32:15.517 --> 32:17.685
Hey, how'd it go, bro?

32:18.478 --> 32:21.188
- We killed it, Johnny.
- Yeah!
