WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:10.416
(slow footsteps approaching)

00:25.583 --> 00:27.750
You mourn the loss

00:25.583 --> 00:27.750
of your power?

00:27.750 --> 00:31.916
I once sensed every element

00:27.750 --> 00:31.916
that binds this world,

00:31.916 --> 00:35.916
felt them as one breathes air.

00:35.916 --> 00:38.875
But I gave unto you

00:35.916 --> 00:38.875
that which you deserve.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.833
My strength grows each day.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.833
Perhaps a small token

00:41.833 --> 00:44.833
of my affection...

00:44.833 --> 00:46.875
is warranted.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.000
(grunts)

01:01.500 --> 01:03.083
My love,

01:03.083 --> 01:06.041
I received but only

01:03.083 --> 01:06.041
a fraction of my power.

01:06.041 --> 01:09.208
Now you know

01:06.041 --> 01:09.208
exactly how I feel.

01:09.208 --> 01:13.666
Summoning one pitiful creature

01:09.208 --> 01:13.666
at a time to feed my hunger.

01:13.666 --> 01:18.375
Existing on drops of rain

01:13.666 --> 01:18.375
rather than a flood.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.250
You wish to be my equal?

01:26.958 --> 01:29.083
Then as I suffer...

01:29.083 --> 01:32.375
so shall you.

01:36.958 --> 01:40.583
(panting)

01:40.583 --> 01:43.208
Hands where

01:40.583 --> 01:43.208
I can see 'em!

01:40.583 --> 01:43.208
(coughing)

01:45.333 --> 01:47.375
Atticus Nevins.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.791
FBI's most wanted.

01:49.791 --> 01:52.041
Looks like your

01:49.791 --> 01:52.041
running days are over.

01:52.041 --> 01:54.250
(police radio chirps)

01:52.041 --> 01:54.250
This is Hammond. I got him.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.875
Meet me back at the road.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.291
Tell dispatch

01:55.875 --> 01:57.291
we'll need transpo and escort.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.500
Copy that, calling it in.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.833
How did you find me?

01:59.833 --> 02:01.250
Security footage caught you

02:01.250 --> 02:02.958
near a storage facility

02:01.250 --> 02:02.958
in Elmsford.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.541
Don't feel bad.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.458
Everyone's luck runs out

02:04.541 --> 02:06.458
sooner or later.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.000
(growling)

02:09.000 --> 02:10.500
What was that?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.916
Stay put.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.041
(growling)

02:20.041 --> 02:22.416
(yelling):

02:20.041 --> 02:22.416
No! No!

02:22.416 --> 02:28.458
(singing along with recording):

02:22.416 --> 02:28.458
♪ O sole mio... ♪

02:29.500 --> 02:31.750
(singing in Italian)

02:33.666 --> 02:35.458
(Italian opera song continues)

02:41.083 --> 02:44.083
(resumes singing)

02:50.666 --> 02:52.208
(humming)

02:55.166 --> 02:56.875
(song ends)

02:56.875 --> 02:58.833
Salud.

02:58.833 --> 03:02.041
(door opening)

03:02.041 --> 03:06.041
Buona sera, Signorina.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.375
Buona sera.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.750
Okay.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.458
You know I'm loving the

03:10.750 --> 03:13.458
five-star treatment, but...

03:13.458 --> 03:15.666
you got to stop

03:13.458 --> 03:15.666
spoiling me, Crane.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.041
(laughs)

03:17.041 --> 03:19.416
When patriot prisoners of war

03:19.416 --> 03:22.333
were freed after the British

03:19.416 --> 03:22.333
retreated from Philadelphia,

03:22.333 --> 03:27.875
they dined for weeks in order

03:22.333 --> 03:27.875
to revive their broken spirits.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.958
You know, I fended for myself

03:27.875 --> 03:30.958
ten months

03:30.958 --> 03:32.541
in those catacombs.

03:32.541 --> 03:34.916
I don't need

03:32.541 --> 03:34.916
to be pampered, Crane.

03:34.916 --> 03:39.291
You, Lieutenant,

03:34.916 --> 03:39.291
are a woman of infinite pride

03:39.291 --> 03:41.666
and unparalleled

03:39.291 --> 03:41.666
resourcefulness.

03:41.666 --> 03:43.083
But...

03:44.750 --> 03:47.250
...after the deprivation

03:44.750 --> 03:47.250
you endured...

03:48.625 --> 03:51.833
...this is the very least

03:48.625 --> 03:51.833
I could do.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.833
Mm, and a reminder.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.958
We are to attend

04:00.958 --> 04:04.125
the cinema this evening

04:00.958 --> 04:04.125
with Miss Jenny and Master Joe.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.958
Top of the billing

04:04.125 --> 04:06.958
at the Music Hall is  E.T.,

04:06.958 --> 04:09.958
which apparently concerns

04:06.958 --> 04:09.958
a diminutive being

04:09.958 --> 04:12.583
stranded far from home.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.208
Perhaps

04:15.250 --> 04:18.208
a different suggestion...

04:18.208 --> 04:21.458
No. Crane,  E.T.'s  a classic.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.458
You should see it.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.875
Truth is I came home

04:21.458 --> 04:23.875
to pick up a few things.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.541
I booked some time at the range.

04:25.541 --> 04:28.791
Gotten a little rusty

04:25.541 --> 04:28.791
since I've been away, so,

04:28.791 --> 04:31.083
keep it warm for me.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.250
Yes, of course I can.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.291
Are you maintaining a journal?

04:36.291 --> 04:38.291
Yeah, it's supposed to help me

04:38.291 --> 04:40.083
"define and sort

04:38.291 --> 04:40.083
through my trauma,"

04:40.083 --> 04:41.666
but seeing

04:40.083 --> 04:41.666
as how every day

04:41.666 --> 04:44.291
I was down there was the same

04:41.666 --> 04:44.291
as the one before,

04:44.291 --> 04:45.708
it makes for

04:44.291 --> 04:45.708
a pretty boring read.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.250
And...

04:47.250 --> 04:49.458
to answer the question

04:47.250 --> 04:49.458
that you are thinking,

04:49.458 --> 04:52.625
but not asking directly...

04:52.625 --> 04:54.041
I'm fine.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.750
And thanks to you,

04:56.750 --> 05:01.666
I'm taking it all

04:56.750 --> 05:01.666
meal by splendid meal.

05:01.666 --> 05:04.000
Signore Crane.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.583
Tenente.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.166
(door closes)

05:22.333 --> 05:25.208
Sure you don't want me

05:22.333 --> 05:25.208
to come in with you?

05:26.458 --> 05:28.333
I'm sure.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.875
You can do this, Jen.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.375
You need to.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.375
(indistinct chatter)

05:46.875 --> 05:48.083
Hey.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.875
Thanks for meeting me.

05:49.875 --> 05:53.125
Hope I didn't bring you

05:49.875 --> 05:53.125
too far out of your way.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.541
I was surprised

05:56.375 --> 05:58.541
you took my call.

05:58.541 --> 06:00.875
You kind of caught me off guard.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.250
You're the spitting image

06:04.125 --> 06:06.250
of your mother, you know?

06:06.250 --> 06:07.958
Same hair,

06:07.958 --> 06:10.208
eyes.

06:07.958 --> 06:10.208
This is a mistake.

06:10.208 --> 06:12.666
Jennifer, Jennifer, wait.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.541
Look, you don't owe me anything,

06:18.541 --> 06:20.250
but for what it's worth,

06:20.250 --> 06:22.750
I'm just here to listen

06:20.250 --> 06:22.750
to whatever you need to say.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.125
I have hated you

06:25.458 --> 06:28.125
for as long as I can remember.

06:28.125 --> 06:31.333
I've had epic conversations

06:28.125 --> 06:31.333
with you in my mind,

06:31.333 --> 06:33.208
just telling you all

06:33.208 --> 06:34.916
the many, many reasons

06:34.916 --> 06:36.208
I think

06:34.916 --> 06:36.208
you're a terrible person.

06:38.541 --> 06:41.291
Asking you why you abandoned us,

06:41.291 --> 06:44.125
how you could just walk away

06:41.291 --> 06:44.125
from your family.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.125
(scoffs)

06:47.125 --> 06:48.833
But now that you're sitting here

06:47.125 --> 06:48.833
right in front of me,

06:48.833 --> 06:51.291
I don't know

06:48.833 --> 06:51.291
what to say to you.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.125
I'd say you're closing in on it.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.041
Why did you leave us?

07:01.583 --> 07:02.750
Because of Mom?

07:02.750 --> 07:03.916
No.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.916
No, it was me.

07:07.125 --> 07:10.458
When her illness

07:07.125 --> 07:10.458
kicked in...

07:10.458 --> 07:13.208
I didn't know

07:10.458 --> 07:13.208
how to handle it.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.000
And being a fool, I drank.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.750
In the end,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.750
I joined the Navy

07:16.750 --> 07:18.583
because we needed

07:16.750 --> 07:18.583
medical benefits.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.500
I also needed to sober up.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.666
So, they shipped me overseas,

07:20.500 --> 07:23.666
long-term deployments.

07:23.666 --> 07:26.791
I stayed

07:23.666 --> 07:26.791
for three consecutive tours.

07:26.791 --> 07:29.083
And when I got out

07:26.791 --> 07:29.083
six years later,

07:29.083 --> 07:31.041
life had moved on.

07:31.041 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, Mom was dead.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.166
Abbie and me were

07:33.000 --> 07:35.166
in foster care.

07:35.166 --> 07:38.458
And I've lived with the shame

07:35.166 --> 07:38.458
and regret for decades.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.916
But I'm not here

07:42.916 --> 07:45.166
looking for absolution

07:45.166 --> 07:46.208
or forgiveness.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.541
Then what do you want?

07:47.541 --> 07:49.375
To tell you...

07:49.375 --> 07:51.041
there wasn't anything you did,

07:51.041 --> 07:54.916
or your sister,

07:51.041 --> 07:54.916
or your mother.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.291
I think it's important

07:54.916 --> 07:57.291
you both hear that from me.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.916
I'd like to see Abbie.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.041
(gunshots)

08:21.208 --> 08:22.458
(gunshots)

08:27.833 --> 08:30.125
(gunshots)

08:41.625 --> 08:43.083
(sighs)

08:43.083 --> 08:44.708
Maybe lay off

08:43.083 --> 08:44.708
the coffee.

08:44.708 --> 08:46.541
Might be giving you

08:44.708 --> 08:46.541
the jitters.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.666
I don't drink the stuff anymore.

08:49.666 --> 08:51.166
Maybe start up again.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.625
I'm gonna chalk this up

08:52.625 --> 08:55.500
to us both having

08:52.625 --> 08:55.500
A type personalities.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.125
Seemed like a better option

08:57.125 --> 08:59.958
than take-out food

08:57.125 --> 08:59.958
and paperwork. You?

08:59.958 --> 09:03.000
I needed to clear my head,

08:59.958 --> 09:03.000
that's all.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.666
Maybe I should

09:03.000 --> 09:04.666
have checked to see

09:04.666 --> 09:07.291
if you had time booked

09:04.666 --> 09:07.291
before I showed up.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.333
It's fine, Danny.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.291
So our talk

09:11.250 --> 09:14.291
the other day...

09:14.291 --> 09:17.500
I said some things I

09:14.291 --> 09:17.500
wasn't expecting to admit.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.125
You said 'em.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.750
And, honestly,

09:23.125 --> 09:25.750
I meant them.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.166
Not to make

09:25.750 --> 09:27.166
things awkward,

09:27.166 --> 09:29.291
but to get things

09:27.166 --> 09:29.291
back on track for us.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.083
You know, having each

09:29.291 --> 09:31.083
other's backs again,

09:31.083 --> 09:33.125
trusting each other.

09:33.125 --> 09:35.500
Things happened, the Nevins

09:33.125 --> 09:35.500
case, but that doesn't mean

09:35.500 --> 09:38.125
we have to throw away everything

09:35.500 --> 09:38.125
we worked so hard to build.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.666
It's too important.

09:41.666 --> 09:44.125
You're  too important.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.333
Maybe next time

09:46.750 --> 09:49.333
we have a chat like this,

09:49.333 --> 09:52.833
it's not in the FBI gun range

09:49.333 --> 09:52.833
at 8:00 at night.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.250
There's a pancake house

09:52.833 --> 09:55.250
around the corner,

09:55.250 --> 09:57.000
if you want to be

09:55.250 --> 09:57.000
a diva about it.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.583
Another time.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.583
Woman with a gun.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.041
(laughs)

10:00.041 --> 10:02.041
I heard that.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.666
(phone buzzes)

10:03.666 --> 10:07.000
(sighs)

10:13.291 --> 10:15.166
(phone buzzes)

10:21.500 --> 10:22.750
(coughing) Please don't shoot.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.000
Nevins?!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.458
Mills, thank God

10:24.000 --> 10:25.458
you got my message.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.166
Hands behind your head!

10:27.166 --> 10:28.375
The a reason I...

10:27.166 --> 10:28.375
Now!

10:28.375 --> 10:30.375
(coughing)

10:28.375 --> 10:30.375
Up against the tree.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.791
I don't know

10:30.375 --> 10:31.791
if you're stupid or crazy,

10:31.791 --> 10:34.250
but I'm bringing you in.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.416
(handcuffs jangling)

10:35.416 --> 10:37.000
Hand.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.666
(grunts)

10:38.166 --> 10:40.666
(coughing)

10:42.916 --> 10:44.916
What in the hell happened

10:42.916 --> 10:44.916
to you?

10:44.916 --> 10:46.291
Another run-in with Pandora?

10:46.291 --> 10:47.750
Worse.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.708
You saw what did this?

10:54.708 --> 10:56.166
It came after me, too.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.250
It's inhuman.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.458
It's unstoppable.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.625
I know this creature, Mills.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.791
If you want to stop it,

11:00.625 --> 11:03.791
you need my help.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.833
♪ ♪

11:46.208 --> 11:48.208
This is cozy.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.291
It's a monster-proof cell.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.250
Should be plenty

11:50.291 --> 11:52.250
to hold a worm like you.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.791
I don't know what attacked you,

11:55.791 --> 11:57.958
but it's too bad

11:55.791 --> 11:57.958
it didn't finish the job.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.291
We didn't end things

11:59.291 --> 12:01.041
on good terms, did we?

11:59.291 --> 12:01.041
Oh, what,

12:01.041 --> 12:02.541
you mean when you

12:01.041 --> 12:02.541
almost put a bullet in my head?

12:02.541 --> 12:04.416
JENNY: Or when you helped

12:02.541 --> 12:04.416
Pandora raise an evil god

12:04.416 --> 12:05.833
that almost killed us all?

12:05.833 --> 12:07.375
Yeah, I guess

12:05.833 --> 12:07.375
we're not quite over it.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.416
Hey, I'm the one

12:07.375 --> 12:09.416
who was shot, who was arrested,

12:09.416 --> 12:11.583
who lived on the streets

12:09.416 --> 12:11.583
like an animal.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.583
Whatever you went through,

12:11.583 --> 12:13.583
I don't think it was enough.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.291
Are you sure

12:13.583 --> 12:15.291
about that, son?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.000
Take a look.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.958
My God.

12:25.958 --> 12:27.458
It's pretty, isn't it?

12:27.458 --> 12:28.750
(coughing)

12:28.750 --> 12:29.916
Pandora wanted

12:28.750 --> 12:29.916
her pound of flesh,

12:29.916 --> 12:31.500
but she wanted it literally.

12:32.666 --> 12:33.750
(grunting)

12:33.750 --> 12:35.208
Did you know a man

12:35.208 --> 12:36.708
can live without a spleen?

12:38.750 --> 12:41.083
Pandora promised

12:38.750 --> 12:41.083
him riches and glory

12:41.083 --> 12:44.083
in exchange for obtaining

12:41.083 --> 12:44.083
the Eye of Providence for her.

12:44.083 --> 12:47.666
When he failed to do so,

12:44.083 --> 12:47.666
she terminated his services.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.583
How the mighty fall.

12:50.583 --> 12:51.833
JOE: All right,

12:50.583 --> 12:51.833
so why'd you come to us, huh?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.666
Big fish like you,

12:53.666 --> 12:55.500
I mean, you must have a lot of

12:53.666 --> 12:55.500
people you can go to for help.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
Oh, yeah. One little arrest,

12:57.500 --> 12:59.750
all my associates

12:57.500 --> 12:59.750
turn their backs on me,

12:59.750 --> 13:01.875
huh?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.875
So I see your angle.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.000
You help us catch

13:01.875 --> 13:04.000
the monster...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.458
And we help you get out of town.

13:05.458 --> 13:06.875
I need some assurances.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.875
Safe passage out of the country.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.041
Passport,

13:08.875 --> 13:12.041
money that can't be traced.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.041
Thanks but...

13:12.041 --> 13:14.666
we'll find the creature

13:12.041 --> 13:14.666
ourselves.

13:14.666 --> 13:17.208
No, you won't.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.333
Not without my help.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.250
This isn't one

13:19.333 --> 13:22.250
of Pandora's utility players.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.458
You won't believe

13:22.250 --> 13:24.458
where it comes from.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.750
People are dying out there.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.166
We need him to talk.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.583
This calls to mind

13:28.166 --> 13:29.583
an interrogation tactic

13:29.583 --> 13:30.583
of Washington's.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.625
Now, if used properly,

13:33.625 --> 13:36.500
it could encourage him

13:33.625 --> 13:36.500
to loosen his tongue.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.458
(coughing)

13:38.041 --> 13:40.458
(door opens)

13:42.708 --> 13:44.916
Here's the deal:

13:42.708 --> 13:44.916
depending on the value

13:44.916 --> 13:47.125
of the information

13:44.916 --> 13:47.125
that you give us,

13:47.125 --> 13:50.458
we will consider getting you

13:47.125 --> 13:50.458
across the Canadian border.

13:50.458 --> 13:54.083
No guarantees, no assurances.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.083
And as a gesture of good faith,

13:56.083 --> 13:57.791
in accordance with

13:56.083 --> 13:57.791
the proper treatment

13:57.791 --> 14:01.625
of prisoners and with the

13:57.791 --> 14:01.625
proviso you cooperate,

14:01.625 --> 14:03.250
you shall be fed.

14:05.791 --> 14:07.416
ABBIE:

14:05.791 --> 14:07.416
But if you mess with us,

14:07.416 --> 14:09.375
we will gift wrap you

14:07.416 --> 14:09.375
to the FBI.

14:14.916 --> 14:17.375
(chewing,

14:14.916 --> 14:17.375
crunching sounds)

14:22.958 --> 14:24.583
Ugh.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.041
Uh...

14:29.625 --> 14:30.666
ABBIE:

14:29.625 --> 14:30.666
You said that you had

14:30.666 --> 14:32.958
information about this creature.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.125
'91. Iraq.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.375
End of Gulf War One.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.291
Pulling back

14:40.375 --> 14:42.291
from Al Busayyah,

14:42.291 --> 14:44.291
rumor starts to float around

14:42.291 --> 14:44.291
about a cave,

14:44.291 --> 14:46.125
just north of the Saudi border.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.375
They say

14:46.125 --> 14:47.375
it's full of millions

14:47.375 --> 14:49.125
of dollars of Iraqi gold.

14:49.125 --> 14:52.291
And being a true privateer,

14:49.125 --> 14:52.291
you decided to retrieve it.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.541
Some men in the platoon and I,

14:54.541 --> 14:58.416
we ran a little undercover,

14:54.541 --> 14:58.416
off-the-record mission...

14:58.416 --> 15:01.083
This war might prove interesting

14:58.416 --> 15:01.083
after all, gentlemen.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.500
MAN: Webb, Chalsen,

15:01.083 --> 15:03.500
Check for trip wires!

15:03.500 --> 15:04.750
Roger that, Sergeant!

15:04.750 --> 15:07.291
...including someone you knew.

15:07.291 --> 15:11.791
If you're done ruining

15:07.291 --> 15:11.791
the moment, Sergeant Corbin.

15:11.791 --> 15:15.250
That's right.

15:11.791 --> 15:15.250
Saint August Corbin,

15:15.250 --> 15:17.833
Marine sergeant,

15:15.250 --> 15:17.833
moral babysitter.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.833
It's your party, Atticus.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.208
I just came along to make

15:19.833 --> 15:22.208
sure no one gets killed.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.500
WEBB:

15:22.208 --> 15:23.500
Sergeant!

15:26.541 --> 15:29.000
You called it,

15:26.541 --> 15:29.000
Sergeant Nevins.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.625
The damn mother lode.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.958
Well, there's

15:30.625 --> 15:32.958
no perimeter defenses,

15:32.958 --> 15:34.000
no booby traps?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.083
This is all way too easy.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.083
NEVINS:

15:36.083 --> 15:38.083
Just like the whole operation.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.500
Load 'em up, boys!

15:50.166 --> 15:51.500
(distant whooshing)

15:53.750 --> 15:55.208
We're not alone.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.041
(snarling)

15:58.541 --> 16:00.875
(gunshots)

16:00.875 --> 16:03.125
Ambush! Fall back!

16:04.375 --> 16:05.208
(shrieking)

16:21.250 --> 16:22.708
What the hell was that?

16:30.916 --> 16:33.875
August saved my life that day.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.791
So after the war,

16:40.791 --> 16:44.125
August is obsessed with trying

16:40.791 --> 16:44.125
to figure out what we had seen.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.041
It was his first contact

16:44.125 --> 16:47.041
with the supernatural,

16:47.041 --> 16:48.791
and it never left him.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.208
Imagine my shock

16:48.791 --> 16:51.208
when the same damn creature

16:51.208 --> 16:53.625
shows up in Sleepy Hollow.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.875
That's a good story. This

16:53.625 --> 16:55.875
helps us find the creature how?

16:55.875 --> 16:59.291
You take me

16:55.875 --> 16:59.291
to August's files.

16:59.291 --> 17:03.041
I guarantee

16:59.291 --> 17:03.041
you'll get what you need.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.833
You mean these files?

17:03.041 --> 17:05.833
JOE: Yeah, we've gone

17:03.041 --> 17:05.833
through those already.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.833
There's nothing that matches

17:05.833 --> 17:07.833
the creature you described.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.375
Mother, may I?

17:11.625 --> 17:14.041
Yeah.

17:14.041 --> 17:15.208
(clicking)

17:18.750 --> 17:20.375
(sighs)

17:25.833 --> 17:27.833
Now, what you all

17:25.833 --> 17:27.833
don't know is

17:27.833 --> 17:32.416
what a paranoid bastard

17:27.833 --> 17:32.416
ol' Sheriff Corbin was.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.833
He had major...

17:39.250 --> 17:41.666
(thump, click)

17:43.083 --> 17:45.375
...trust issues.

17:48.166 --> 17:52.458
You want to know everything he

17:48.166 --> 17:52.458
knew about that-that-that thing?

17:52.458 --> 17:54.000
Try August Corbin's

17:54.000 --> 17:56.666
case file number one.

17:56.666 --> 17:59.208
All right. Come on.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.833
Well, according

18:02.666 --> 18:04.833
to the sheriff's research,

18:04.833 --> 18:08.000
the creature is an ancient

18:04.833 --> 18:08.000
Mesopotamian  ghallu,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.541
more commonly known

18:08.000 --> 18:10.541
as a demonic ghoul.

18:10.541 --> 18:12.708
They're used as guardians

18:10.541 --> 18:12.708
of sacred temples and crypts.

18:12.708 --> 18:15.083
Ruthless predators,

18:12.708 --> 18:15.083
said to hunt without mercy.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.583
Ah, here.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.583
The creature's

18:16.583 --> 18:18.541
only weakness is something known

18:18.541 --> 18:21.083
as an  Aurum Scarabaeus Sacer.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.625
A Golden Scarab.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.250
"Whomsoever possesses the scarab

18:26.250 --> 18:28.833
"shall become master

18:26.250 --> 18:28.833
to the ghoul, which will perform

18:28.833 --> 18:30.166
its every bidding."

18:28.833 --> 18:30.166
JOE: Okay.

18:30.166 --> 18:32.041
So we find

18:30.166 --> 18:32.041
the scarab thing,

18:32.041 --> 18:34.000
we stop the monster.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.375
MAN:  I don't feel so good

18:38.000 --> 18:41.375
stealing from our old boss.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.000
This is Nevins

18:41.375 --> 18:43.000
we're talking about.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.916
Mr. Loyalty Is Dead.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.541
Hey. Randall Martin's stock

18:44.916 --> 18:47.541
is rising.

18:47.541 --> 18:49.666
If he's gonna take over

18:47.541 --> 18:49.666
Nevins' operation,

18:49.666 --> 18:52.708
we have got to get

18:49.666 --> 18:52.708
into his good books.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.916
Let's go.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.541
The place has

19:02.875 --> 19:05.541
been cleaned out.

19:05.541 --> 19:08.208
By who? Randall?

19:08.208 --> 19:10.458
(sighs)

19:08.208 --> 19:10.458
Someone got here first.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.083
Vin...

19:14.291 --> 19:15.416
(screaming)

19:21.500 --> 19:23.583
No one knows anything

19:21.500 --> 19:23.583
about a golden artifact

19:21.500 --> 19:23.583
that controls a ghoul.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.625
Hey, is this a bad time?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.625
Reynolds is running

19:26.625 --> 19:28.125
a briefing in a few minutes,

19:28.125 --> 19:29.333
and I can't find

19:28.125 --> 19:29.333
the damn statewide warrant list.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.500
I saw Dad.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.375
Yesterday.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.458
I wasn't completely sure

19:33.375 --> 19:36.458
I wanted to tell you.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.291
It's not exactly the right time.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.291
It's never really

19:38.291 --> 19:41.291
the right time.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.291
Abbie,

19:41.291 --> 19:44.291
you're different

19:41.291 --> 19:44.291
than before you disappeared.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.125
You're dealing

19:46.125 --> 19:47.541
Don't think

19:46.125 --> 19:47.541
I can't see that.

19:47.541 --> 19:50.291
I know when

19:47.541 --> 19:50.291
you're hurting.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.916
I don't want anything

19:50.291 --> 19:52.916
to cause you more pain.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.416
That's not your call, sis.

19:57.416 --> 19:59.250
I know.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.250
Which is why I'm here right now.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.791
He wants to see you.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.041
What'd you tell him?

20:07.041 --> 20:08.708
Told him I'd talk to you.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.750
You did.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.041
I appreciate it.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.125
What did it feel like,

20:21.125 --> 20:22.958
seeing him?

20:22.958 --> 20:24.708
It wasn't easy.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.166
Gary Wallis and Vincent Rota.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.791
Found in a storage unit

20:34.166 --> 20:36.791

20:36.791 --> 20:40.208
Similar M.O. to the first

20:36.791 --> 20:40.208

20:40.208 --> 20:42.666
Evidence of rage. Overkill.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.250
Ritualistic evisceration.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.875
Wallis and Rota

20:44.250 --> 20:46.875
were known associates

20:46.875 --> 20:48.916
of Atticus Nevins,

20:46.875 --> 20:48.916
who's still at large.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.416
The storage unit

20:50.416 --> 20:53.250
was rented by a shell company

20:50.416 --> 20:53.250
controlled by Nevins.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.625
Which means

20:53.250 --> 20:55.625
this could be

20:55.625 --> 20:58.208
a rival moving in

20:55.625 --> 20:58.208

immediately.

(growls)

29:43.166 --> 29:45.000
(phone ringing)

29:43.166 --> 29:45.000
Uh, Abbie?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.916
I need you to stop Nevins.

29:46.916 --> 29:47.958
He took Corbin's files.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.000
Crane, move!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.625
(gunshots)

29:54.625 --> 29:57.833
(gunshots)

29:54.625 --> 29:57.833
Abbie!

29:57.833 --> 29:59.833
You need to find Nevins;

29:57.833 --> 29:59.833
he'll be in the tunnels by now.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.750
(gunshots)

30:02.750 --> 30:04.916
(growls)

30:11.958 --> 30:13.125
I'm open to any ideas right now.

30:13.125 --> 30:15.041
(gunshot)

30:16.375 --> 30:17.208
The scarab.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.583
Target the scarab on his chest.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.708
It may be his

30:20.583 --> 30:22.708
proverbial Achilles heel.

30:23.458 --> 30:24.416
Go.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.208
Lieutenant!

30:37.541 --> 30:39.166
JENNY (in distance):

30:37.541 --> 30:39.166
He can't be far.

30:39.166 --> 30:40.375
He was playing us

30:39.166 --> 30:40.375
the whole time;

30:40.375 --> 30:41.583
I should've seen it.

30:41.583 --> 30:42.958
Later, okay?

30:42.958 --> 30:44.291
Hey, let's split up.

30:44.291 --> 30:46.291
We'll cover ground faster.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.458
(loud growl)

31:03.458 --> 31:05.875
Crane, I can't hit

31:03.458 --> 31:05.875
a target that small.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.041
Go. Go, go.

31:08.041 --> 31:09.916
Lieutenant! Lieutenant,

31:09.916 --> 31:11.166
you have this.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.458
(growls)

31:14.458 --> 31:15.291
(Crane grunts)

31:16.208 --> 31:17.041
Come on.

31:22.833 --> 31:23.833
Lieutenant!

31:25.708 --> 31:27.083
Come on, come on...

31:34.500 --> 31:36.375
Shoot it!

31:44.208 --> 31:46.625
(growls)

31:53.708 --> 31:55.750
Nice shooting, Mills.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.833
It's just about practice.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.791
(panting)

32:02.416 --> 32:03.750
Agent Foster.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.083
How's it going?

32:03.750 --> 32:05.083
All right.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.083
Can I ask you guys...

32:07.083 --> 32:09.166
are they all this ugly?

32:09.166 --> 32:11.083
Uh...

32:11.083 --> 32:12.416
actually, usually

32:11.083 --> 32:12.416
they're worse.

32:12.416 --> 32:14.833
This one's not too bad.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.583
Toss your weapon.

32:29.833 --> 32:31.083
This is your girl, here.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.041
You were family once.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.250
"Family."

32:39.250 --> 32:41.500
August Corbin hated me.

32:41.500 --> 32:44.416
He was just a holier-than-thou

32:41.500 --> 32:44.416
son of a bitch.

32:44.416 --> 32:45.750
He never gave in to temptation.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.750
He never took a bribe.

32:47.750 --> 32:50.916
You could literally choke

32:47.750 --> 32:50.916
on his saintliness.

32:50.916 --> 32:54.666
Don't you move.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.333
You know, I actually think my

32:59.041 --> 33:01.333
father meant a lot more to you

33:01.333 --> 33:03.750
than you're willing to admit.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.375
And I know how that is,

33:03.750 --> 33:06.375
believe me.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.166
I mean, I spent my whole life

33:08.166 --> 33:10.583
pretending like

33:08.166 --> 33:10.583
his opinion didn't matter to me.

33:10.583 --> 33:12.750
And I have just been trying

33:12.750 --> 33:16.625
for so long to understand him.

33:16.625 --> 33:20.375
And, you know what, man,

33:16.625 --> 33:20.375
I think I finally do.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.375
You loved him, Atticus.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.958
We both did.

33:25.958 --> 33:28.333
And you know damn well

33:25.958 --> 33:28.333
what he'd say to you right now.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.708
The hell with August Corbin.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.166
And the hell with you.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.166
(running footsteps departing)

33:57.833 --> 33:59.750
(sniffs)

33:59.750 --> 34:01.000
Hey.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.166
Hey.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.875
How are you?

34:06.875 --> 34:08.625
Well, I fought a ghoul

34:08.625 --> 34:10.625
so... horrible.

34:08.625 --> 34:10.625
(chuckles)

34:10.625 --> 34:11.541
(chuckles)

34:11.541 --> 34:13.708
Come here.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.250
(sighs)

34:22.250 --> 34:25.291
Nevins got away with the one

34:22.250 --> 34:25.291
document Corbin's been trying

34:25.291 --> 34:27.291
to keep from everyone

34:25.291 --> 34:27.291
for 20 years.

34:27.291 --> 34:30.291
Well, then we'll

34:27.291 --> 34:30.291
go get it back.

34:30.291 --> 34:33.291
You and I are getting pretty

34:30.291 --> 34:33.291
good at tracking stuff down.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.125
"Good"?

34:35.125 --> 34:37.125
We're the best.

34:37.125 --> 34:39.458
We're like Bonnie and Clyde.

34:39.458 --> 34:41.250
Minus the crime spree.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.041
You know how you said

34:43.875 --> 34:46.041
you would give anything

34:46.041 --> 34:49.041
for a few more minutes

34:46.041 --> 34:49.041
with your dad?

34:49.041 --> 34:52.791
You're not the only one

34:49.041 --> 34:52.791
who felt that way.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.833
But you made

34:52.791 --> 34:55.833
that happen for me.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.458
Nobody's ever done anything

34:58.083 --> 35:01.458
like that for me before.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.416
Well, you know,

35:03.416 --> 35:05.791
your dad took off on you

35:03.416 --> 35:05.791
when you were a kid.

35:05.791 --> 35:07.833
Mine was partners

35:05.791 --> 35:07.833
with a thief.

35:07.833 --> 35:10.916
So, uh, we got

35:07.833 --> 35:10.916
that in common.

35:10.916 --> 35:14.083
(chuckles)

35:14.083 --> 35:16.666
You know, I hated him

35:14.083 --> 35:16.666
for a long time.

35:16.666 --> 35:19.500
Thought he was...

35:16.666 --> 35:19.500
being more of a father

35:19.500 --> 35:22.583
to everyone else than

35:19.500 --> 35:22.583
he was to me, but...

35:22.583 --> 35:25.416
knowing the company

35:22.583 --> 35:25.416
he had to keep, the...

35:25.416 --> 35:28.666
the secrets that

35:25.416 --> 35:28.666
he had to protect...

35:30.333 --> 35:32.250
...I wish I could

35:30.333 --> 35:32.250
tell him just once

35:32.250 --> 35:34.666
that I think he was

35:32.250 --> 35:34.666
one hell of a guy.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.666
I envy that.

35:46.333 --> 35:50.083
♪ My sins from my youth ♪

35:50.083 --> 35:54.708
♪ Don't remember my sins... ♪

35:54.708 --> 35:56.416
I'd ask how you

35:54.708 --> 35:56.416
found me, but...

35:56.416 --> 35:58.750
you are a federal agent.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.625
I should have called.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.458
I'm just glad to see you.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.958
Yeah, Jenny wasn't gonna tell me

36:02.458 --> 36:04.958
that she'd seen you.

36:04.958 --> 36:06.875
But, you know, with her and I,

36:04.958 --> 36:06.875
it's hard to hide things

36:06.875 --> 36:08.416
for long, so...

36:09.375 --> 36:12.000
I came here

36:12.000 --> 36:17.583
because I need

36:12.000 --> 36:17.583
to ask you something about Mom.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.791
Right.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.875
When she began to unravel,

36:21.875 --> 36:23.166
what were

36:21.875 --> 36:23.166
the first signs?

36:23.166 --> 36:25.583
And how fast did it come on?

36:25.583 --> 36:28.208
Well, I-I don't remember

36:25.583 --> 36:28.208
how it started.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.291
It came in fits

36:28.208 --> 36:30.291
and starts.

36:30.291 --> 36:33.541
She'd be fine one minute

36:30.291 --> 36:33.541
and then having hallucinations

36:33.541 --> 36:35.583
the next. It was

36:33.541 --> 36:35.583
like she was living

36:35.583 --> 36:37.708
in two different realities.

36:37.708 --> 36:39.916
As it went along,

36:39.916 --> 36:41.375
she pushed me away,

36:39.916 --> 36:41.375
wouldn't let me in.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.250
And that's when you left us.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.250
Well, I started thinking maybe

36:43.250 --> 36:46.250
I was the problem, you know?

36:46.250 --> 36:48.916
Maybe if I wasn't around,

36:46.250 --> 36:48.916
things would get better.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.916
But, truthfully,

36:50.916 --> 36:52.375
I was just scared as hell.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.541
So was Mom.

36:53.541 --> 36:54.958
But she faced it

36:53.541 --> 36:54.958
all alone.

36:54.958 --> 36:56.875
She died alone.

36:56.875 --> 36:58.500
Hell, maybe that's

36:58.500 --> 37:00.083
in the cards

36:58.500 --> 37:00.083
for all of us.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.083
That's the way

37:00.083 --> 37:02.083
the Mills women kick off,

37:02.083 --> 37:03.750
crazy and alone.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.333
No. That's not gonna happen

37:03.750 --> 37:05.333
to you.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.333
You don't know that.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.625
You have no idea who I am.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.375
You don't know a lot

37:08.625 --> 37:11.375
about me either, Abbie.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.208
The one thing I know

37:11.375 --> 37:13.208
about our family,

37:13.208 --> 37:15.041
your mother's

37:13.208 --> 37:15.041
side and mine,

37:15.041 --> 37:16.958
is that we're strong people.

37:16.958 --> 37:18.583
Yeah, I've

37:16.958 --> 37:18.583
made mistakes.

37:18.583 --> 37:20.958
Had the hell

37:18.583 --> 37:20.958
knocked out of me.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.791
But I'm still standing.

37:22.791 --> 37:24.625
And so are you.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.791
You know what I remember?

37:33.291 --> 37:36.625
Um...

37:36.625 --> 37:39.625
your voice.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.625
Used to read stories to me,

37:41.625 --> 37:44.041
sing songs.

37:44.041 --> 37:46.791
I loved that voice.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.416
And I'm sorry

37:49.000 --> 37:51.416
you haven't heard it in a while.

37:51.416 --> 37:53.125
Me, too.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.875
But, Abbie,

37:54.875 --> 37:57.041
if you're going through

37:54.875 --> 37:57.041
something difficult right now,

37:57.041 --> 37:59.416
I want to help.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.000
Yeah, I have people

38:01.250 --> 38:04.000
for that now.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.500
Maybe one day.

38:14.708 --> 38:17.083
(phone rings)

38:19.958 --> 38:22.166
Are you avoiding my calls?

38:22.166 --> 38:25.333
Because it's been a few days

38:22.166 --> 38:25.333
since we last spoke.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.750
It's been a busy time.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.500
Any problems

38:26.750 --> 38:29.500
I should know about, Daniel?

38:29.500 --> 38:30.916
Such as?

38:30.916 --> 38:32.333
I've heard that Agent Mills

38:32.333 --> 38:34.958
is not as stable

38:32.333 --> 38:34.958
as she once was,

38:34.958 --> 38:36.958
that she's changed.

38:36.958 --> 38:38.875
Mills is a good agent.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.708
She'll find her feet again.

38:40.708 --> 38:43.666
Under your keen eye, Daniel,

38:40.708 --> 38:43.666
I have no doubt.

38:43.666 --> 38:45.916
Oh, one other thing:

38:43.666 --> 38:45.916
I want you to downgrade

38:45.916 --> 38:47.666
the search for Atticus Nevins.

38:47.666 --> 38:49.666
Minor resources only.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.750
Why the hell would I do that?

38:51.750 --> 38:54.750
Because I ordered you to.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.750
Satisfied?

39:00.958 --> 39:02.958
It's a start.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.375
The funds have already

39:02.958 --> 39:04.375
been transferred

39:04.375 --> 39:05.791
to your account in Geneva,

39:05.791 --> 39:07.500
and there is

39:05.791 --> 39:07.500
a plane standing by,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.458
waiting to take you

39:07.500 --> 39:09.458
wherever you choose.

39:09.458 --> 39:12.708
Oh, and I have a, uh,

39:09.458 --> 39:12.708
cash bonus for you.

39:15.791 --> 39:17.416
You have something for me.

39:19.333 --> 39:22.333
From the files

39:19.333 --> 39:22.333
of August Corbin.

39:22.333 --> 39:26.833
It's the exact coordinates

39:22.333 --> 39:26.833
of the nine sacred sites.

39:26.833 --> 39:29.125
Well, I can't tell you

39:26.833 --> 39:29.125
how much this means to us.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.083
Well, I don't really care.

39:31.083 --> 39:33.750
I just retired.

39:33.750 --> 39:36.125
Yes, Mr. Nevins...

39:36.125 --> 39:37.916
(gunshot)

39:37.916 --> 39:40.125
...you just did.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.250
Bologna on whole wheat?

39:48.250 --> 39:50.000
That is the Charlie Brown

The bald boy

with awful luck?

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
"Good grief."

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
(chuckles)

39:55.000 --> 39:56.833
I take offense.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.875
I'll make us

39:58.875 --> 40:00.875
a real sandwich.

40:00.875 --> 40:02.583
And give me a hand.

40:07.791 --> 40:09.250
I see your wheels turning.

40:09.250 --> 40:10.666
Go on and ask.

40:10.666 --> 40:13.333
You saw your father.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.333
I did.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.291
I'm still processing it.

40:19.958 --> 40:23.375
By your tone, am I to assume

40:19.958 --> 40:23.375
this topic is to be shelved

40:23.375 --> 40:24.833
until later discussion?

40:24.833 --> 40:26.291
Nailed it.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.583
But I will talk about the fact

40:27.583 --> 40:29.083
that it has been hard lately,

40:29.083 --> 40:30.625
adjusting to being back,

40:30.625 --> 40:34.000
and I guess I want you to know

40:34.000 --> 40:35.541
that I am working on it.

40:37.541 --> 40:40.791
You have endured an ordeal

40:37.541 --> 40:40.791
few can even imagine.

40:40.791 --> 40:42.625
Except you.

You know exactly what it's like

40:42.625 --> 40:45.041
to look around

40:45.041 --> 40:47.375
and everything

40:45.041 --> 40:47.375
is exactly the same

40:47.375 --> 40:50.666
but completely different.

40:55.708 --> 40:57.708
I'm trying really hard.

40:57.708 --> 40:59.500
And you will succeed.

41:01.791 --> 41:05.791
Just as you were by my side when

41:01.791 --> 41:05.791
I returned to Sleepy Hollow,
