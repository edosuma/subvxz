WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:02.080
Oh, sorry.

00:02.080 --> 00:03.700
Since the drug bust, we're so broke

00:03.700 --> 00:06.060
that we had to rent out our house to Felix's family.

00:06.060 --> 00:08.360
We're just good buddies who occasionally have sex.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.480
You screwed her best friend. Give up.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.970
We were humiliated. We were betrayed.

00:12.980 --> 00:13.960
I had this girlfriend,

00:13.960 --> 00:16.680
and she dumped me to get back with her ex-boyfriend.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.700
I love you, and I'm not giving up.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.450
Honey, I don't need a resume.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.820
I have a job. I'm at work right now.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.340
Making artisanal soaps isn't a real job.

00:29.340 --> 00:30.670
Tell my back that.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.370
And you know my first job will always be mother.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.890
- Oh, I'm sensing you're upset. - Let's see.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.130
My parents got arrested for selling drugs,

00:40.140 --> 00:42.790
and now I sleep in a juice truck in our backyard

00:42.790 --> 00:44.500
right next to a teepee where said parents

00:44.500 --> 00:45.880
have loud sex every night.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.340
Venus was ascending.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.130
And I know that this has been hard,

00:49.140 --> 00:51.640
but I promise, soon we'll be past these money issues

00:51.640 --> 00:52.580
and back in our house.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.060
Only if you get real jobs.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.220
- Okay, let's make a resume. - Really?

00:57.220 --> 00:58.300
- Mm-hmm. - Great.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.810
Let's start with work history.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.230
Well, I was an aura cleanser

01:03.430 --> 01:05.080
and a mushroom forager.

01:05.180 --> 01:07.860
And, oh, before that I was a massage therapist.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.180
Were you certified?

01:09.180 --> 01:12.070
No, my style was more intuitive.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.970
I wish I didn't have to go to work tonight.

01:17.970 --> 01:20.110
These past four days have been amazing.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.810
My lips are gonna miss you.

01:23.580 --> 01:27.260
My whole face is gonna miss you.

01:27.260 --> 01:28.780
I wish I could just put you in my pocket

01:28.780 --> 01:30.160
and just take you with me.

01:30.430 --> 01:32.480
Yeah. Yeah, me--me too.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.350
We are down a cater waiter.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.100
Jane quit after her vibrator cozies blew up on Etsy.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.080
You could take her place.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.200
Oh, well, um...

01:42.870 --> 01:44.520
Uh, wow, cozies.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.970
Is that a-- is that a real thing?

01:45.970 --> 01:48.970
I need a job. I am so sorry.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.020
I, uh, should've knocked.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.020
Karma, relax. We were just talking.

01:53.030 --> 01:53.970
Actually, uh,

01:53.970 --> 01:57.040
Reagan was saying how they're down a cater waiter tonight.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.120
Hello, problem?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.980
This is your answer calling.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.570
We haven't hung out in forever.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.580
Not since you and Reagan started nesting.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.220
Nesting? We're not pigeons.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.710
She's been staying in your coop every night this week.

02:15.710 --> 02:18.110
That's exactly why I need to stay in tonight.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.420
I need a little me time.

02:19.420 --> 02:23.220
Is someone feeling a bit, "Can't breathe!"

02:23.220 --> 02:25.180
- "Ugh, I can't breathe!" - No, someone is not.

02:25.190 --> 02:27.420
I just need a night off so I can miss her, you know?

02:27.420 --> 02:29.180
Why don't you just tell Reagan how you feel?

02:29.180 --> 02:31.380
Uh, why don't you just tell Duke you outed him?

02:32.940 --> 02:35.250
Is that angry music coming from inside my head?

02:40.990 --> 02:42.510
Lauren, are you okay?

02:44.340 --> 02:46.530
- Should we? - Yes.

02:48.970 --> 02:50.640
Get the out of here!

02:52.960 --> 02:55.050
Okay, your job is to blend in.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.790
Don't chat with guests. You're not one of them.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.500
And whatever you do, 

02:57.500 --> 02:59.940
do not make direct eye contact with Creepy Steve.

03:00.490 --> 03:01.940
Who's Creepy Steve?

03:02.420 --> 03:03.820
The guy carving the meat.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.510
Okay, got it. Um...

03:08.980 --> 03:10.600
Should I get started?

03:10.610 --> 03:12.980
Ah-ah-ah, that's for the servers.

03:12.980 --> 03:16.480
- You're the sweeper. - Sounds fun.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.170
Used napkins, half-eaten skewers,

03:18.180 --> 03:20.600
anything goopy that no one wants to touch, grab it.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.630
With my bare hands?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.260
Everyone starts out as a sweeper.

03:23.260 --> 03:24.710
It's really not that bad.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.080
Actually, it's horrible,

03:26.090 --> 03:27.780
but don't let it show on your face.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.010
I cannot believe I'm about to be streamed

03:36.010 --> 03:37.520
around the world wearing this.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.870
Look at me. I look like a fool.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.930
You forget that your audience is a bunch of nerds

03:40.930 --> 03:43.350
who are dying to have a computer strapped to their face.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.550
You'll be their hero,

03:44.920 --> 03:46.790
even if you look like Mr. Peanut.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.800
- Okay, what gives? - Nothing.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.070
Yeah, I'm not playing that game.

03:52.080 --> 03:52.750
What game?

03:52.760 --> 03:54.200
The game where you give me one word answers

03:54.200 --> 03:55.600
and make me drag it out of you.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.960
I'm not in middle school. Use your words.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.470
I went to Karma's house last night,

03:59.470 --> 04:02.010
and this shirtless guy was in her room.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.340
Do you think they're sleeping together?

04:03.340 --> 04:04.530
He could be a homeless guy

04:04.530 --> 04:07.150
that Karma's helping clean up for his first job interview.

04:07.150 --> 04:09.560
- You think so? - No, they're doing it.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.730
Liam, if you want her back, just tell her.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.230
No, she'll just say no.

04:14.230 --> 04:15.570
She hasn't forgiven me yet.

04:15.570 --> 04:17.410
Then tell her that you gave up art for her.

04:17.410 --> 04:18.529
That's a pretty huge sacrifice.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.220
- I can't. - Why not?

04:20.220 --> 04:21.730
Trust me, girls eat that up.

04:21.740 --> 04:22.630
'Cause I have my reasons, okay?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.570
So can we just drop it?

04:24.870 --> 04:25.860
Oh, crap.

04:25.870 --> 04:27.850
I just opened the web browser.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.890
Oh, that is definitely not safe for work.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.520
Someone grab your ass? Don't freak.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.790
The pervs usually give the best tips.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.280
Liam's here.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.470
He is? Oh, right.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.330
This is a Skwerkel event.

04:45.470 --> 04:47.080
Probably should have told you that.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.620
Probably. Great.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.040
Now I get to spend the night picking up Liam's goop.

04:52.310 --> 04:54.030
Crap, my ex is here too.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.850 --> 05:06.580
Hurry. If she finds out we're in here--

05:06.580 --> 05:08.840
She'll use our skin to make her prom dress?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.100
The past few weeks, she's been talking about how

05:10.100 --> 05:11.920
she's over Theo, but look at this.

05:12.460 --> 05:15.310
This is the work of someone seriously unhinged.

05:15.310 --> 05:18.440
I always said she could use a good dose of electroshock.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.420
She's standing right behind us, isn't she?

05:24.960 --> 05:26.810
Hello, Amy. Shane.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.940
I think it would be best for everyone involved

05:28.940 --> 05:31.110
if you two leave and we never speak of this again.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.940
No, we need to talk about this.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.640
Yeah, we really need to, because this is all wrong.

05:35.650 --> 05:37.570
None of these revenge scenarios are practical.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.500
I mean, arsenic poisoning could take weeks.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.130
What are you doing?

05:40.130 --> 05:41.240
If you want to get back at Theo,

05:41.240 --> 05:42.510
why don't you just go to his new school

05:42.510 --> 05:43.170
and out him as a narc.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.640
Outing people-- that's your solution to everything, isn't it?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.410
It's too simple and totally obvious.

05:47.410 --> 05:48.980
And let's not forget dangerous.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.770
He might get the crap beat out of him by a mob of angry students.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.140
Good point. It's perfect.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.600
According to my intel, Theo is at Baldwin High School.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.100
He's on the basketball team,

05:58.100 --> 06:02.660
and I saw there's a pep rally tonight.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.170
If we hurry, we can make it.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.180
I'll go shower.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.330
Why are you encouraging this?

06:08.330 --> 06:09.940
Durr, because it's fun.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.660
But also, Lauren clearly needs this to move on,

06:12.840 --> 06:14.400
and who better to help her than--

06:14.410 --> 06:17.110
- You. - Her sister.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.100
Ugh, fine. I'll go.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.750
Enjoy your evening.

06:28.450 --> 06:29.780
- Charlotte. - Reagan?

06:31.250 --> 06:33.130
- It's been a while. - Yeah.

06:33.210 --> 06:35.440
Well, that's what happens when you break up, you know?

06:35.930 --> 06:37.310
The passage of time.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.270
You look great.

06:40.270 --> 06:41.670
I love the purple hair.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.290
Here's some fresh ice, babe.

06:44.290 --> 06:45.570
'Sup? I'm Todd.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.740
- Charlotte's... - Boyfriend. Yeah, I know.

06:48.890 --> 06:52.310
This is Reagan. She's an old friend.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.470
Karma?

06:59.350 --> 07:00.370
Liam.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.480
Uh, what are the odds?

07:02.480 --> 07:06.440
I got this job cater waitering, and I love it.

07:06.670 --> 07:08.150
Different party every night.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.480
But I'm surprised to see you here.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.090
I thought you hated all things Skwerkel.

07:15.990 --> 07:20.120
Yeah, it's this really long and--and really boring story.

07:20.390 --> 07:23.870
And you're at work, so...

07:23.960 --> 07:25.650
Speaking of being surprised,

07:25.730 --> 07:29.000
I met your new friend last night when I knocked on your window.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.010
He seemed shirtless.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.070
You were at my house?

07:36.630 --> 07:39.540
Which is fine but, uh,

07:39.550 --> 07:43.300
not fine because, uh, boundaries.

07:43.410 --> 07:46.090
Um, but that was Felix,

07:46.090 --> 07:47.900
and he's just a friend.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.020
No need to be jealous.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.430
- I'm not. - Good.

07:53.050 --> 07:57.160
Uh, 'cause, you know, you and I are just friends who--

07:57.160 --> 07:59.500
Occasionally have sex. Yeah, no, I get it.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.190
I just didn't realize that you had other friends.

08:05.810 --> 08:10.230
I do, and, uh, you should too.

08:10.950 --> 08:11.870
I should.

08:13.940 --> 08:16.110
Yeah, 'cause you're such a friendly guy.

08:16.420 --> 08:17.340
Karma.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.180
- This is Zita. - Karma.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.610
I've heard lots about you.

08:21.610 --> 08:23.060
Yeah, Zita's a good friend.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.570
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:24.780 --> 08:26.780
we're gonna go and get friendly in the bathroom.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.410
Ugh, what a little bitch!

08:31.420 --> 08:33.730
I was just thinking the same thing.

08:33.730 --> 08:34.980
We dated for two years,

08:34.980 --> 08:37.280
and she's gonna introduce me as her friend?

08:37.950 --> 08:40.700
Well, Liam just went with his new friend 

08:40.700 --> 08:42.500
to the bathroom to have sex.

08:43.110 --> 08:44.830
We can't let them treat us like this.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.400
We have to make them pay.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.760
Yeah, but they'd know it was us,

08:47.760 --> 08:49.350
and I can't get caught with blood on my hands.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.120
Not real blood. I mean, metaphorical blood,

08:51.120 --> 08:53.230
because, to be clear, I'm not killing anyone.

08:53.230 --> 08:56.620
What if I got revenge on your ex

08:56.620 --> 08:58.330
and you get revenge on mine?

08:59.220 --> 09:00.000
Deal?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.970
I like the way you think.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.450
Ooh, I really shouldn't.

09:07.450 --> 09:08.870
But they're so good.

09:08.870 --> 09:10.060
And are they vegan?

09:10.930 --> 09:13.200
- Totally. - Thanks.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.940
- Karma. - Hey, Zita.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.580
Look, about me and Liam, before you hate--

09:19.580 --> 09:22.320
Hate you? I don't hate you.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.230
I don't hate you at all.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.450
Karma, I'm not sleeping with Liam.

09:25.450 --> 09:27.650
I could care less. You're not?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.020
Not even a little bit.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.860
He only has eyes for you.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.870
He's too noble to tell you this,

09:32.870 --> 09:33.760
but I'm not.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.710
The guy gave up art to get you and your family out of jail.

09:37.390 --> 09:39.040
That's the deal he made with his dad.

09:41.070 --> 09:41.890
I know.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.140
The guy's practically a Disney prince.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.200
So maybe cut him some slack?

09:49.120 --> 09:51.710
1-2-3-4. 1-1-1-1.

09:52.170 --> 09:55.000
2-4-6-8. Ugh, this is useless.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.820
We could be here all night. We need another plan.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.700
Or we could go home, share some ice cream.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.360
Mint chocolate chip. Yeah?

10:01.360 --> 10:03.010
Karma's good at schemes. Let's give her a call.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.120
See how she'd get in.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.310
I can't. She's at work.

10:05.310 --> 10:06.900
I got her a job catering with Reagan.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.100
T-minus 35 minutes.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.420
Stay here--I'll scan the area for another way in.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.180
Sounds good, Rambo.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.570
You put Karma and Reagan together on purpose?

10:16.570 --> 10:18.450
Are you trying to upset the balance of the universe

10:18.450 --> 10:19.160
and destroy us all?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.870
Well, Reagan said they were down one person at work,

10:21.910 --> 10:23.440
and Karma could really use the money.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.570
And...

10:24.570 --> 10:25.770
And I didn't want to do it.

10:25.770 --> 10:27.080
Why didn't you tell Reagan that?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.810
Because I don't want her to get mad at me.

10:28.810 --> 10:30.730
This might come as a shock, but I don't like conflict.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.550
So if you can't ask for space, I'm guessing

10:32.560 --> 10:35.270
you didn't tell her you're sometimes attracted to guys.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.300
If you want to have a real relationship with Reagan,

10:38.300 --> 10:39.700
you can't keep things from her

10:39.700 --> 10:42.140
just because you're scared she won't want to hear them.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.200
And don't try to turn this around on me.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.920
Our situations are completely different.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.210
- Jeez. - How'd you get in there?

10:47.210 --> 10:49.220
Let's just say I have really small hands.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.960
Move it. Come on.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
- You roofied him? - Not yet.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.730
I got one from Creepy Steve and dissolved it in Liam's water.

10:55.730 --> 10:56.970
We just need him to drink it.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.270
What'd you do to Charlotte?

10:58.930 --> 11:01.410
I gave her a non-vegan egg roll.

11:08.550 --> 11:09.710
Uh, you can't drink that.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.530
It's not filtered.

11:17.230 --> 11:18.100
My mouth was dry.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.630
I guess I am a little nervous.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.250
It's only the biggest product launch

11:21.250 --> 11:22.590
in this company's history.

11:22.590 --> 11:23.320
Come on, Liam.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.280
Let's go crush it.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.170
Okay. We all clear on the plan?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.740
We sneak in there, grab the microphone, and out Theo.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.660
- It's not that complicated. - Beg to differ.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.560
And why am I the one who has to be the mascot?

11:35.560 --> 11:36.440
I mean, really.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.690
Because you have the coordination of a baby goat.

11:39.650 --> 11:40.910
It seem weird that I'm slightly

11:40.910 --> 11:42.270
attracted to you right now?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.990
Um, excuse me. Hiya.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.620
Who the deuce are you bitches?

11:45.620 --> 11:46.730
Let me handle this.

11:46.870 --> 11:49.120
We're the bitches that just got bumped up from JV.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.610
Hmm, coach didn't say jack about it to me.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.270
Well, maybe she's lost faith in your ability to lead.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.690
You guys better be up to speed.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.520
That was very impressive.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.550
Never show fear.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.840
Lauren, this is insane. Look, I get it.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.800
Theo hurt you and all, you want to do is hurt him back,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.690
but trust me, it's not gonna make you feel better.

12:08.690 --> 12:10.250
Well, it can't make me feel worse.

12:15.470 --> 12:19.410
And now, the Baldwin High varsity cheerleaders.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.160
That way.

12:27.850 --> 12:30.200
Now, before we bring out the basketball players,

12:30.200 --> 12:33.450
this amazing cheerleading squad will perform

12:33.660 --> 12:37.270
their national championship winning routine right now.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.710
Yo, yo, here we go.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.820
Yo, yo, three, four.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.350
Cheerleading isn't so hard.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.440
I can't believe they won nationals with this.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.140
Run past us.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.270
Oh, my God. It's coming right towards us.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.100
Lift me up.

13:16.100 --> 13:19.510
- Ow, your crotch is on my neck. - Just don't drop me.

13:19.510 --> 13:21.590
- Amy, spot me. - I don't know what that means.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.160
Go Buccs!

13:31.160 --> 13:32.580
Well, that was different.

13:32.590 --> 13:33.890
And now it's time to bring out

13:33.890 --> 13:36.680
the Baldwin High basketball team.

13:41.630 --> 13:42.790
Here we go.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.840
I'm fine. Don't worry.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.000
Be happy.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.090
Very funny, dad.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.560
If you're doing this to freak me out, it worked, okay?

13:52.560 --> 13:53.830
You can stop now.

13:54.950 --> 13:55.960
Dad.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.140
You know, I feel the same way.

13:58.610 --> 13:59.650
Right here.

14:01.510 --> 14:02.750
Great. Got it.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.520
Bookers, we are ready for you.

14:04.530 --> 14:05.250
Great.

14:05.900 --> 14:06.960
You got it.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.460
Be right there.

14:09.850 --> 14:10.790
Is he drunk?

14:11.040 --> 14:13.060
The only thing I saw him drink was a glass of...

14:15.430 --> 14:16.890
I don't have time to wait for the end of that sentence.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.940
We have a Skwerkel-cast going live in 30 seconds.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.280
You'll have to give the presentation.

14:22.850 --> 14:24.240
Just read the teleprompter.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.610
I'm just supposed to be the model.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.080
Every once in a while,

14:38.170 --> 14:40.440
a revolutionary product comes along

14:40.440 --> 14:41.960
that changes everything.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.870
Skwerkel is very fortunate

14:43.870 --> 14:46.050
to be able to introduce this new product

14:46.050 --> 14:47.290
into your world.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.670
Take dramatic pause. Gaze out at audience.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.910
Oh, holy. I wasn't supposed to read that.

14:53.910 --> 14:55.990
No, no, no, no. The thingy's going too fast.

14:58.710 --> 15:02.200
You know what? Who needs a teleprompter?

15:02.820 --> 15:06.760
I'm just here to tell you about the Skwerkel Monocle.

15:09.230 --> 15:10.300
I'll admit it.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.950
At first, I thought this was a dumb idea.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.120
Really dumb.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.850
But I've always dreamed of having a computer strapped to my face.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.350
And guess what. It is awesome.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.290
I'm checking my email right now while I talk to you.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.660
Huh, just saved that to my trash folder.

15:29.330 --> 15:31.110
All right, maybe I went overboard.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.260
You think?

15:32.390 --> 15:36.920
It's just Charlotte really played with my head.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.150
She used me as a test to prove whether or not

15:39.150 --> 15:42.310
she was actually a lesbian, and guess what the results were.

15:42.510 --> 15:45.810
- Reagan, that sucks. I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

15:46.540 --> 15:47.750
I've learned from my mistakes,

15:47.750 --> 15:49.300
and now I have an awesome girlfriend

15:49.300 --> 15:50.700
who's got it all figured out.

15:53.490 --> 15:54.920
And I know what you're thinking.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.320
"Does it affect your depth perception?"

15:57.370 --> 15:59.620
The answer is no.

16:01.950 --> 16:03.150
Just kidding, folks.

16:04.010 --> 16:05.280
This thing is awesome.

16:08.420 --> 16:12.680
Number 28, Alex. Let's hear it for Palmer.

16:12.730 --> 16:17.880
Last but not least, number 23. Let's hear it for Jimmy.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.860
Attention, Baldwin High.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.420
There's something you all should know about Jimmy.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.080
He isn't who he says he is.

16:30.080 --> 16:30.970
He's...

16:34.320 --> 16:35.260
He's...

16:36.360 --> 16:37.660
Lauren, please.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.790
Can I get an N-A-R-C?

16:47.790 --> 16:50.260
He's not the man he seems to be!

16:50.260 --> 16:51.890
- He's a narc! - Narc!

16:51.890 --> 16:53.520
- He's a narc! - Yeah, he's a narc.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.190
Narc.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.250
Narc.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.390
Okay, now that everyone's gone,

17:05.390 --> 17:08.760
I just want to say that I am so, so sorry.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.460
It was just a stupid revenge plot

17:10.460 --> 17:11.660
that got totally out of hand.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.300
You tried to roofie me.

17:13.720 --> 17:18.130
I was jealous that you slept with Zita.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.010
I didn't.

17:19.010 --> 17:21.109
I just said that because you slept with Felix.

17:21.109 --> 17:22.700
- I didn't. - You didn't?

17:22.859 --> 17:23.819
Then why was he shirtless--

17:23.819 --> 17:25.180
I'll tell you about that later.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.960
But first.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.700
You gave up art for me?

17:33.710 --> 17:34.850
Zita told you?

17:35.510 --> 17:37.560
The real question is why you didn't.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.360
Because I didn't do it to buy your forgiveness.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.420
I want to earn that.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.340
But do you think I ever will?

17:50.160 --> 17:53.460
Look, I want to forgive you.

17:54.710 --> 17:56.710
You're doing all the right things.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.900
I'm just scared of getting hurt again,

18:05.260 --> 18:09.540
which is why I need to be in control.

18:12.970 --> 18:15.350
I'm okay with that.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.650
Then put your hands behind your back.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.670
I used too much glue.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.140
It's a good thing you're so pretty.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.190
Hey, are you okay?

18:55.890 --> 18:56.950
You were right.

18:57.410 --> 19:01.220
Revenge on Theo, Jimmy, whatever the hell his name is,

19:01.840 --> 19:03.410
it didn't make me feel any better.

19:03.530 --> 19:04.790
It's just gonna take time.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.860
Great. Time.

19:07.770 --> 19:09.370
That wasn't the answer I wanted.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.310
I got to go.

19:14.730 --> 19:17.260
Maybe you can squeeze in a little me time before bed,

19:17.260 --> 19:18.320
if you know what I mean.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.210
Very funny, but I texted Reagan,

19:21.210 --> 19:22.530
and she's on her way over.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.390
I'm gonna tell her how I really feel.

19:26.820 --> 19:27.700
You were right.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.620
If I want a real relationship with her,

19:29.620 --> 19:31.930
then I have to be honest.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.480
Arr, I've got your back, matey.

19:34.780 --> 19:35.800
Don't do that.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.650
- Speaking of being honest. - I'm not telling Duke.

19:40.650 --> 19:41.470
Got to run.

19:41.930 --> 19:42.800
Bye!

19:46.980 --> 19:48.540
Oh, Karma. How'd it go?

19:49.950 --> 19:52.290
- We need to talk. - Oh, no.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.510
Did you two get in a fight?

19:53.510 --> 19:55.270
No, actually, we bonded.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.270
I got to learn a little more about Reagan.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.140
Like, did you know that her last girlfriend dumped her for a boy,

20:01.140 --> 20:02.990
and now she has zero tolerance for girls 

20:02.990 --> 20:05.040
who are questioning their sexuality?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.930
Oh, that.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.650
She thinks you have it all figured out.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.510
Amy, you have to tell her the truth.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.260
I know. But how do I even begin?

20:16.450 --> 20:18.670
"Oh, by the way, I'm sometimes attracted to guys

20:18.670 --> 20:20.460
and oh, I once slept with Liam."

20:21.100 --> 20:23.910
Maybe ease into that last part.
