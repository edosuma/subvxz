WEBVTT

00:08.316 --> 00:10.500
I can't do these
late nights anymore.

00:10.501 --> 00:12.302
My girl's about to walk.

00:12.370 --> 00:17.107
Yeah, my old lady's like,
bring home the double overtime.

00:17.175 --> 00:19.376
Well, you can't win.

00:19.443 --> 00:21.311
Tell me about it.

00:23.915 --> 00:26.816
What the hell?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.061 --> 00:40.863
Probably drunk or high.

00:40.931 --> 00:43.398
Hey!

00:43.465 --> 00:46.267
Hey!

00:48.004 --> 00:50.205
This is a work zone.

00:50.272 --> 00:52.240
You gotta leave!

00:52.308 --> 00:54.876
Something awful happened.

00:54.944 --> 00:57.012
This road's closed.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.379
Down by the trailhead.

01:00.982 --> 01:02.583
What is it?

01:02.650 --> 01:06.053
Someone's been
a real bad boy.

01:22.837 --> 01:25.071
See anything?

01:28.142 --> 01:29.908
Holy crap.

01:31.677 --> 01:34.279
Call the cops.

01:34.347 --> 01:37.582
Make sure that guy
doesn't go anywhere.

01:46.103 --> 01:48.004
All right, Jack, try again.

01:48.071 --> 01:49.171
I got it!

01:49.239 --> 01:51.107
Good try. Good try.
Take it out, try it again.

01:51.174 --> 01:53.042
Hey. What are you
doing here?

01:53.110 --> 01:54.611
I thought
you had to work.

01:54.678 --> 01:56.045
Mm. I snuck out
to see you and Jack.

01:56.113 --> 01:57.446
I gotta get back soon,
though.

01:57.515 --> 02:00.850
Yeah, that's how you score,
Jack. Good job! Whoo!

02:00.918 --> 02:03.652
You could do the same
at my place tonight.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.087
Ha! That's me
being brazen.

02:06.155 --> 02:07.489
Shocking, Ms. Clemons.

02:07.557 --> 02:10.358
Mm-hmm. Well, just to prove that
I don't have a one-track mind,

02:10.425 --> 02:13.829
there's also something that I
would like to talk to you about.

02:13.897 --> 02:15.564
What's up?

02:15.632 --> 02:17.065
Uh...

02:17.133 --> 02:18.733
It can wait till tonight.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.104
Or not. Duty calls?

02:24.172 --> 02:25.139
Yeah.

02:25.206 --> 02:26.741
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

02:26.808 --> 02:28.709
Um, can you give me a hint?

02:28.777 --> 02:31.178
Uh...

02:31.246 --> 02:34.447
I got a job offer
in New York.

02:34.515 --> 02:35.448
Hi, Beth!

02:35.516 --> 02:38.051
Hi! Ohh!

02:38.118 --> 02:39.052
Good job.

02:39.119 --> 02:40.954
Thanks. Thanks.
Hey, good job, buddy.

02:41.022 --> 02:42.622
Can we get ice cream?

02:42.690 --> 02:45.725
Uh, I gotta go to work,
so, if we do,

02:45.793 --> 02:48.094
we gotta make it fast, ok?
Ok?

02:48.162 --> 02:49.262
All right, go take
one more shot.

02:49.329 --> 02:51.830
I gotta go anyway.

02:53.166 --> 02:56.569
So I'll call you when I get back
and we'll talk, ok?

02:56.636 --> 02:59.705
Yeah. I'll be waiting.

03:09.014 --> 03:11.816
5 days ago the Yamada family
went missing from their home

03:11.884 --> 03:13.217
in Kansas City, Kansas.

03:13.285 --> 03:15.692
Last night a road crew found
3 members of the family,

03:15.693 --> 03:18.028
John, Tricia, and their
16-year-old daughter Kristen

03:18.096 --> 03:22.098
all dead, all shot to death
and left at the side of a highway.

03:22.166 --> 03:25.023
Uh, they were tipped off
to the location by a drifter

03:25.048 --> 03:25.868
who is now M.I.A.

03:25.869 --> 03:28.571
And the youngest child,
Scott Yamada, is still missing?

03:28.638 --> 03:31.374
Yeah. The murder weapon
was an unregistered 9-millimeter.

03:31.442 --> 03:32.875
It was found near the bodies.

03:32.943 --> 03:34.610
There were prints on the gun
that were the father's,

03:34.678 --> 03:36.512
and there was gunshot
residue on his hand.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.448
So he drove his family
away from their home,

03:39.515 --> 03:42.784
hooded his wife and daughter,
shot them, then committed suicide.

03:42.851 --> 03:44.686
Why do it out here?

03:44.753 --> 03:47.789
That is unusual. Most familicides happen
in the comfort of the home.

03:47.856 --> 03:49.291
So what happened to the son?

03:49.358 --> 03:52.060
He either shot him first
or he wanted to spare him.

03:52.128 --> 03:53.462
Well, if he spared the son,

03:53.529 --> 03:55.997
it's most likely
he left him in a safe place,

03:56.065 --> 03:58.232
maybe with a relative,
before he carried this out.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.068
Next of kin hasn't seen him.

04:00.135 --> 04:01.569
Guys, wait a minute.
The M.E. report said

04:01.637 --> 04:03.838
the gunshot residue was
on the father's right hand.

04:03.906 --> 04:05.473
But he's wearing his
watch on his right arm,

04:05.540 --> 04:07.942
which means he's most likely
left-handed.

04:08.010 --> 04:09.443
Maybe someone
set the father up

04:09.511 --> 04:11.244
to make it look like
he did it.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.081
Excuse me.

04:14.148 --> 04:15.082
Hotchner.

04:15.149 --> 04:17.017
I talked to local police.

04:17.084 --> 04:19.753
There's no pending divorce,
no recent job loss.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.855
There's no obvious problems
the Yamadas were having,

04:21.923 --> 04:24.357
so they're treating this sudden
disappearance as an abduction.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.959
It's pretty extreme
to take an entire family.

04:27.027 --> 04:29.962
Unless the son
was the primary target.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.931
And the rest of the family
was in the way.

04:31.998 --> 04:34.767
Yeah, remember sexual predator
Matthew Hoffman in 2010?

04:34.835 --> 04:36.301
He killed a mother, son,
and family friend

04:36.369 --> 04:37.903
just so he could take
the 13-year-old daughter.

04:37.971 --> 04:42.473
If we're looking at a sexual predator,
Scott could still be alive.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.375
Thank you.

04:44.443 --> 04:46.477
Another family, the Acklins,
have just disappeared

04:46.545 --> 04:49.080
from, uh, Lenexa, which is
a suburb of Kansas City.

04:49.148 --> 04:52.117
A father, mother, 17-year-old daughter,
and 11-year-old son.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.452
The family makeup
is almost identical to the Yamadas.

04:54.519 --> 04:56.921
The father's in the middle
of a lawsuit for fraud,

04:56.989 --> 04:58.555
so they may have
disappeared voluntarily.

04:58.623 --> 04:59.957
We can't take that chance.

05:00.024 --> 05:01.759
Exactly.
Wheels up in 30.

05:01.826 --> 05:04.728
What do you want
from us?

05:14.337 --> 05:15.304
He untied me.

05:15.372 --> 05:17.339
Mackenzie,
help us. Hurry.

05:23.046 --> 05:24.881
Mom--

05:27.550 --> 05:30.051
Braden's not here.

05:30.887 --> 05:32.187
Braden?

05:32.255 --> 05:34.055
Do you see him?

05:35.158 --> 05:36.091
No.

05:36.159 --> 05:37.692
Braden?

05:43.465 --> 05:45.533
We're locked in here.

05:46.701 --> 05:49.436
Where are we?

The German author
Goethe wrote,

06:33.462 --> 06:35.029
"Behavior is the mirror

06:35.096 --> 06:38.165
in which everyone shows
their true image."

06:38.233 --> 06:41.000
Aside from different
ethnicities,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.804
the Yamadas and Acklins
were remarkably similar.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.372
John Yamada was an engineer,

06:46.441 --> 06:48.408
and his wife
was a bank teller.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.343
Mike Acklin was
a stockbroker,

06:50.411 --> 06:52.479
and his wife Debra
worked as a city clerk.

06:52.547 --> 06:53.980
Bother upper-middle-class
families

06:54.048 --> 06:55.148
living in nice suburbs.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.817
Any chance these families
knew each other?

06:57.884 --> 07:00.185
Not according to my vast,
far-reaching databases.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.219
What about the kids?

07:01.287 --> 07:02.488
Anything
stand out there?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.824
According to teachers,
Scott Yamada was shy,

07:04.891 --> 07:08.093
introverted. He reported
being bullied once.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.463
And Braden Acklin
was recently diagnosed

07:10.530 --> 07:11.796
with Asperger syndrome.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.699
So the kids weren't winning
popularity contests.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.501
You know, they could
have been prime targets

07:16.569 --> 07:18.069
for a sexual predator.

07:18.136 --> 07:19.337
Braden certainly
would be vulnerable.

07:19.404 --> 07:21.305
Unlike classic autism,
language ability is intact

07:21.373 --> 07:23.174
in people with Asperger's.
They appear to lack empathy

07:23.241 --> 07:24.542
and have trouble
reading social cues.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.344
Albert Einstein
supposedly had it,

07:26.411 --> 07:27.845
as do some well-known
Silicon Valley types.

07:27.912 --> 07:29.079
Well, how about you?

07:29.146 --> 07:30.280
What's that?

07:30.348 --> 07:32.182
Hey, Penelope,
you want to tap into

07:32.249 --> 07:33.951
those vast and wide
databases of yours

07:34.018 --> 07:36.620
and see if these families
crossed paths unwittingly?

07:36.688 --> 07:38.021
Even if they didn't
know each other,

07:38.089 --> 07:39.356
they may have gone
to the same place

07:39.423 --> 07:40.791
and met the unsub
separately.

07:40.859 --> 07:43.493
Yes, my sweet, delving into
the digital abyss as we talk.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.894
We all need
to dig more deeply

07:44.962 --> 07:46.896
for information about
both of these families.

07:46.964 --> 07:48.831
And let's not forget this is
still and search and rescue

07:48.899 --> 07:50.165
mission for Scott Yamada.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.467
And if the unsub
sticks to his schedule,

07:51.535 --> 07:54.604
we've got fewer than 3 days
to find the Acklins alive.

07:56.773 --> 07:58.173
Yes, sir.
Agent Hotchner?

07:58.241 --> 07:59.541
I'm Detective Carr.

07:59.609 --> 08:00.809
This is Agent Jareau.

08:00.877 --> 08:01.810
Hi.

08:01.878 --> 08:03.211
Tricia Yamada's mother
is here,

08:03.278 --> 08:05.380
as well as Mike Acklin's
brother.

08:05.447 --> 08:06.915
Any luck finding
the drifter yet?

08:06.983 --> 08:08.583
No, but we have
this composite sketch

08:08.651 --> 08:10.151
we're getting out there.

08:10.219 --> 08:11.486
It's crucial
that we find him.

08:11.554 --> 08:13.154
Given the description
the road crew gave,

08:13.222 --> 08:14.455
he could be our unsub.

08:14.524 --> 08:17.190
We'll double up on canvassing
homeless camps and shelters.

08:17.258 --> 08:18.692
Anything more
on the Acklin family?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.160
Talked to Mike's secretary.

08:20.228 --> 08:21.929
The lawsuit
really shook him up.

08:21.997 --> 08:24.999
Plus he's behind
on his mortgage payments.

08:25.066 --> 08:27.134
I gotta tell you,
some folks here

08:27.201 --> 08:28.836
don't think these two cases
are related.

08:28.904 --> 08:30.504
They think Mike
took his entire family

08:30.572 --> 08:31.738
and walked away?

08:31.805 --> 08:34.273
Times are tough these days.

08:34.341 --> 08:37.710
Some people just
up and try to start over.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.645
Where's Scott?

08:39.712 --> 08:41.147
Where's my grandson?

08:41.214 --> 08:43.282
We don't know,
but we're doing our best

08:43.350 --> 08:44.817
to find him.

08:44.885 --> 08:47.219
Mike's a victim
of the economy.

08:47.287 --> 08:49.021
People have lost money,

08:49.088 --> 08:51.557
so they just want
someone to blame.

08:51.624 --> 08:53.892
Would he walk away
because of a lawsuit?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.961
No way. Not in
a million years.

08:56.029 --> 08:57.996
I was the screw-up
in the family.

08:58.064 --> 08:59.831
He was always
the responsible one.

08:59.899 --> 09:02.801
They were just
an ordinary family.

09:02.869 --> 09:05.402
Who could have done this?

09:05.470 --> 09:07.038
There's nothing
in the bathroom.

09:07.105 --> 09:08.039
Look again.

09:08.106 --> 09:09.239
We've been searching
for hours.

09:09.307 --> 09:11.042
There's no way out of here.

09:11.109 --> 09:15.680
Where's our son?!
What do you want from us?!

09:20.150 --> 09:22.085
No, no, no, Kenz.
Kenz, don't drink that.

09:22.152 --> 09:23.453
It might be poisoned!
I'm thirsty.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.589
Why are you yelling at me?

09:25.656 --> 09:27.323
I'm sorry.

09:27.391 --> 09:28.959
I overreacted, ok?

09:29.026 --> 09:31.761
Just don't eat
or drink anything.

09:31.829 --> 09:34.430
Ohh!
Uhh!

09:36.800 --> 09:38.433
Help!

09:38.501 --> 09:41.236
Help us! Someone help!

09:41.304 --> 09:42.571
Please!

09:42.639 --> 09:44.073
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

09:45.809 --> 09:50.112
Scott Yamada looks like
a typical 10-year-old boy.

09:50.179 --> 09:51.679
This place
brings back memories.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.581
When I was a kid,
I made a model of the Universe

09:53.649 --> 09:54.582
out of salt.

09:54.650 --> 09:56.784
Was it for
a school project?

09:56.852 --> 09:58.452
No, it was a birthday
present for Carl Sagan,

09:58.520 --> 10:00.554
but I don't think
he ever got it.

10:01.757 --> 10:03.190
You know, by the way,

10:03.258 --> 10:06.527
no offense earlier when I
suggested you had Asperger's.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.528
None taken.
When did you do that?

10:10.531 --> 10:13.767
And that's what
I love about you.

10:13.835 --> 10:16.970
You're not overly sensitive
like some people.

10:17.038 --> 10:18.538
I mean, think about
how much time we'd save

10:18.606 --> 10:21.374
if everyone just
got straight to the point.

10:21.442 --> 10:23.676
Yeah. Cut out all the handshakes
and how-do-you-dos.

10:23.744 --> 10:26.712
Yeah.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.314
This window
was opened recently.

10:29.382 --> 10:31.350
It was hot the night
the Yamadas were abducted.

10:31.417 --> 10:34.854
First floor, open window.
Easy entry for unsub.

10:34.921 --> 10:36.255
Top bunk is made.

10:36.322 --> 10:38.758
He probably wasn't
in bed yet.

10:38.825 --> 10:40.191
Well, I think

10:40.259 --> 10:42.226
he slept on the bottom.

10:42.294 --> 10:45.864
Yeah, this tent probably
made him feel safe at night.

10:49.535 --> 10:52.203
He was probably looking
at his fossils.

10:52.271 --> 10:54.739
When the unsub entered,

10:54.807 --> 10:58.075
he dropped one when
he was grabbed.

10:58.143 --> 11:00.811
And then he was forced
out of his room.

11:00.879 --> 11:04.014
It looks like they were fixing
themselves a late-night snack.

11:04.082 --> 11:08.852
Beloved family dog
is left behind.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.189
You know, Rossi, if this was
all a ruse to hide an escape,

11:12.256 --> 11:13.756
it sure was
an elaborate one.

11:13.824 --> 11:17.860
Then, again, people have staged
their own murders to disappear.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.297
Rossi, look at this.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.801
Broken coffee cup.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.571
You think they were
caught off guard?

11:27.638 --> 11:29.938
I mean, being parents, the Acklins
would have been hard-wired

11:30.006 --> 11:31.607
to clean that up so their
kids don't get hurt.

11:31.675 --> 11:33.809
It could have been staged.

11:33.876 --> 11:36.312
It's possible,
but unlikely.

11:36.379 --> 11:38.514
There's easier ways
to fake a forced entry.

11:38.582 --> 11:39.848
Broken locks and furniture.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.918
Busted-out window.

11:42.985 --> 11:45.320
Nah, I definitely think
they were abducted.

11:45.387 --> 11:48.389
It's not easy to subdue
so many people.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.358
Are we looking at a team?

11:54.029 --> 11:57.064
Yeah, this is Morgan.

11:57.132 --> 11:59.066
All right, I got it.

11:59.134 --> 12:00.400
Thanks, Blake.

12:00.468 --> 12:02.336
So, the point of entry
at the Yamada house

12:02.403 --> 12:03.903
was the son's bedroom.

12:03.971 --> 12:07.907
So it would be possible for
one unsub to do it alone.

12:07.975 --> 12:10.344
Especially if he had control
of their son.

12:14.849 --> 12:16.415
Aah!

12:17.684 --> 12:20.853
He'd want the biggest
threat, the father,

12:20.920 --> 12:22.955
under control first.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.557
Put 'em on
if you want him to live.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.592
You take me.
You leave my family alone.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.261
I said put 'em on!

12:28.328 --> 12:31.163
The unsub forces the father
and daughter to wear hoods.

12:31.231 --> 12:33.598
You!

12:33.666 --> 12:35.634
Tie up their hands.

12:35.701 --> 12:37.001
The mother's in the kitchen.

12:37.069 --> 12:39.871
She ties up her husband
and the daughter.

12:39.938 --> 12:41.306
Please--please
don't hurt us.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.575
Braden, tie her up. Here.

12:43.643 --> 12:47.479
Then the unsub makes the boy
tie up the mother's hands.

12:47.546 --> 12:50.714
There's a lot of distance
between neighbors here.

12:50.782 --> 12:54.385
Late at night, no one
would have heard a thing.

12:56.521 --> 12:57.688
Please!

12:57.756 --> 13:00.457
He's an 11-year-old boy!

13:00.525 --> 13:02.926
It's ok, Kenz.

13:02.994 --> 13:04.761
It's ok.

13:10.334 --> 13:12.468
Where's my family?

13:12.536 --> 13:14.103
They're safe.

13:14.171 --> 13:16.272
If you behave,
they'll stay safe.

13:16.340 --> 13:18.341
Are you mad at my dad?

13:20.743 --> 13:22.711
Are you mad at my mom?

13:22.779 --> 13:25.013
Why are you doing this?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.682
Tell you what.

13:26.749 --> 13:28.483
You get 3 guesses.

13:28.551 --> 13:32.253
If you're right,
I'll let your family go.

13:32.322 --> 13:34.556
If you're wrong,

13:34.624 --> 13:36.624
they're dead.

13:49.805 --> 13:52.605
Hey, what is that?

13:52.673 --> 13:55.608
The construction site where
they found Scott Yamada's body

13:55.676 --> 13:58.044
was shut down for two weeks
because of permit issues.

13:58.111 --> 13:59.379
It just reopened.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.448
The body would have been
easy to dump there.

14:01.515 --> 14:04.317
It was outside the fence and there
were no security cameras or guards.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.885
But he left the boy
near the front gate.

14:05.953 --> 14:07.520
He knew
he'd be found quickly.

14:07.588 --> 14:11.223
The M.E. said Scott Yamada
wasn't sexually assaulted or tortured.

14:11.290 --> 14:14.426
C.O.D. was a single gunshot.
He died shortly after the family.

14:14.494 --> 14:16.528
His body was dumped
3 days ago.

14:16.596 --> 14:20.165
So it doesn't fit the profile
of a preferential sex offender.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.067
The body was carefully
wrapped, though,

14:22.134 --> 14:25.035
showing some concern
or remorse for the boy.

14:25.103 --> 14:26.785
Well, what was the motive, then,

14:26.810 --> 14:28.506
for kidnapping and killing
the rest of the family?

14:28.507 --> 14:31.476
To get the boy alone
for card games and hot chocolate?

14:31.543 --> 14:33.344
No, it's possible
the unsub

14:33.412 --> 14:35.946
had some affinity
or affection for Scott.

14:36.014 --> 14:37.515
Yes, or maybe
we have this all wrong.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.284
I mean, what if the rest of the
family was the target all along?

14:40.352 --> 14:43.219
And Scott was just
a tool to control them?

14:43.287 --> 14:45.021
Well, the father was made to
look like the perpetrator,

14:45.089 --> 14:46.523
either as a forensic
countermeasure or because

14:46.591 --> 14:47.857
he was symbolic in some way
to the unsub.

14:49.626 --> 14:50.559
Go ahead, Garcia.

14:50.627 --> 14:52.195
Ok, I can only find
one connection

14:52.263 --> 14:53.696
between these two families
and this is it.

14:53.764 --> 14:55.564
They both vacationed
at a placed called Ravenwood Camp

14:55.632 --> 14:58.701
outside of Topeka
at different times last year.

14:58.769 --> 15:02.071
The Yamadas in April
and the Acklins in July.

15:02.139 --> 15:04.873
We should check it out. We'll need
the names of all the staff and anyone

15:04.941 --> 15:06.641
who overlapped the stays
of the two families.

15:06.709 --> 15:07.642
Got it.

15:07.710 --> 15:10.045
Mike, you've been doing that
all morning.

15:10.113 --> 15:11.380
It is not working.

15:11.447 --> 15:12.747
Do you think he knows
Braden's sick?

15:12.815 --> 15:14.816
He's not sick.

15:14.884 --> 15:17.519
Asperger's makes him
gifted in certain ways.

15:17.586 --> 15:20.254
Mike, will you please stop!

15:21.189 --> 15:22.356
Oh, my God.

15:22.424 --> 15:25.126
Is that Vanessa?

15:26.728 --> 15:30.131
, please!

15:30.198 --> 15:31.565
Vanessa?

15:31.633 --> 15:33.801
Can you see us?

15:33.868 --> 15:37.570
Mike, tell your family
who this is.

15:37.638 --> 15:40.473
It's Vanessa,
my son's tutor.

15:40.541 --> 15:41.741
Why is she--

15:41.809 --> 15:43.843
Tell them who she is.

15:43.911 --> 15:45.478
He said it's our son's tutor.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.580
Now, what did you do to Braden?

15:47.648 --> 15:49.382
Last chance, Mike.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.418
Who is Vanessa?

15:51.485 --> 15:55.087
I told you already. I don't know
anything else about her.

16:14.329 --> 16:17.430
The truth
will set you free, Mike.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.333
What is he talking about?

16:20.400 --> 16:24.170
Tell them,
or Braden is dead.

16:24.237 --> 16:27.440
Come on, Dad,
just say it.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.909
I was, uh...

16:31.544 --> 16:33.812
I slept with her.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.981
It only happened twice
and it was over.

16:36.048 --> 16:39.050
I swear, she meant
nothing to me.

16:39.118 --> 16:44.255
You all have to ask
yourselves why you're here.

16:44.323 --> 16:46.924
Are you kidding me?

16:46.992 --> 16:50.294
We're here because you
couldn't keep your pants on?

16:50.362 --> 16:52.129
You endangered
this entire family?

16:52.197 --> 16:55.165
You put us in the hands
of a psychopath who took our son?!

16:55.233 --> 16:57.234
Who cares at this point
who dad slept with?!

16:57.302 --> 17:01.372
We are trapped here
and Braden is with some psycho!

17:05.309 --> 17:06.175
Deb--

17:06.242 --> 17:08.744
Don't....

17:08.813 --> 17:11.247
Talk to me.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.819
Do you know what the biggest problem
in America is today?

17:15.887 --> 17:18.287
We're losing the war
against antibiotic resistance.

17:18.355 --> 17:19.954
Smartphones.
I saw this family

17:20.022 --> 17:21.757
in a restaurant
the other day

17:21.825 --> 17:23.458
and no one was talking
to each other.

17:23.527 --> 17:25.528
They were all
on their phones.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.963
Texting, tweeting,
emailing, what have you.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.932
It's why the family unit
is dying.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.734
Pretty extreme view.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.731
Not when you see the result
of eliminating modern-day

17:34.756 --> 17:36.292
distractions like we do.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.040
Families ride horses
together.

17:39.107 --> 17:41.342
They hike.
Roast marshmallows.

17:41.410 --> 17:42.610
They reconnect.

17:42.678 --> 17:44.245
Sounds idyllic.
Let me ask you this.

17:44.312 --> 17:46.848
Did the Yamadas or the Acklins
seem troubled to you?

17:46.916 --> 17:48.416
They pretended
like they weren't,

17:48.483 --> 17:50.751
but you can't hide
that stuff.

17:50.818 --> 17:53.186
From what I recall,
Mr. and Mrs. Yamada

17:53.254 --> 17:54.955
argued in their cabin
at night.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.457
The Acklins?
Huh. Hardly spoke to each other

17:57.525 --> 17:59.192
the entire week
they were here.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.962
So I guess you might say that their
stays weren't exactly successful.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.396
We're not miracle workers.

18:03.464 --> 18:05.832
We just want to start
the healing process.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.333
Do you get angry
when it doesn't work?

18:08.401 --> 18:11.170
Because you sent multiple
emails to both families

18:11.237 --> 18:14.674
insisting they return to Ravenwood
soon or they'd regret it.

18:14.741 --> 18:16.408
No offense, but you kind of
strike me as the type of guy

18:16.476 --> 18:18.410
who needs to get
his point across.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.713
So you think what?

18:20.781 --> 18:22.181
I hurt them?

18:22.248 --> 18:26.485
There's this thing
called marketing.

18:26.553 --> 18:29.654
My tactics may be aggressive,
but they work.

18:29.722 --> 18:33.459
So, you're not a murderer.
You're just a businessman.

18:36.196 --> 18:40.264
Hey. So, Mrs. Acklin
was all over social media.

18:40.332 --> 18:43.401
She posted lots
of happy pics of the family

18:43.469 --> 18:45.336
and updated her status
almost daily.

18:45.404 --> 18:48.005
"Mackenzie's on the short list
for prom queen.

18:48.073 --> 18:49.640
Let's wish her luck."

18:49.708 --> 18:51.476
Are all the messages like that?

18:51.543 --> 18:52.710
Yeah, pretty much.

18:52.777 --> 18:55.145
Everything's about
how wonderful the family is,

18:55.213 --> 18:57.481
with lots of
exclamation points.

18:57.548 --> 18:59.483
It's interesting, considering
the problems they've had.

18:59.550 --> 19:00.883
What about the Yamadas?

19:00.951 --> 19:05.722
Uh, yeah, they've got
their own web page, too.

19:05.789 --> 19:07.824
Lots of photos of
a smiling, happy family.

19:07.891 --> 19:10.494
Just like Debra Acklin.

19:12.562 --> 19:14.130
Hey, sweetness,
what do you got?

19:14.197 --> 19:17.333
Tidbits as juicy as you,
love shack. Listen up.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.067
Debra Acklin has been diagnosed
with severe depression.

19:19.136 --> 19:21.403
She's been seeing a therapist
for the last 5 years.

19:21.471 --> 19:25.007
John Yamada has a numbered
offshore account in Panama

19:25.074 --> 19:26.975
that he has made multiple
cash withdrawals from.

19:27.043 --> 19:28.610
I found out about it
when I learned

19:28.677 --> 19:30.945
that he visited there
by himself two years ago.

19:31.013 --> 19:34.282
Well, that could have been for illegal
activity like drugs or gambling.

19:34.350 --> 19:35.583
Oh, indeed it could have.

19:35.651 --> 19:40.855
And then there's Debra's
various social media pages

19:40.922 --> 19:42.890
and yeah, I know. We were just
taking a look at them.

19:42.958 --> 19:44.173
You're not the only one.

19:44.198 --> 19:46.059
There's someone with
an I.D. "All Eyes"

19:46.060 --> 19:50.364
that has visited each page
every day for the last year

19:50.431 --> 19:53.467
up until each family's disappearance.
Coincidence? Methinks not.

19:53.535 --> 19:54.901
Can you track
the I.P. address?

19:54.969 --> 19:56.370
No, I can't.
It's like Kryptonite.

19:56.437 --> 19:58.438
It's been routed through
multiple proxy servers.

19:58.506 --> 19:59.939
All right, thanks, mama.

20:00.007 --> 20:01.875
We just picked up the drifter.

20:01.942 --> 20:04.443
His name is Nathan Eads.
We ran him through ViCAP,

20:04.511 --> 20:07.580
it turns out he's suspected
of robbing and killing a couple

20:07.648 --> 20:10.416
in Omaha in '03.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.554
Mr. Eads, please sit down.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.726
How did you
find the Yamadas?

20:20.794 --> 20:25.297
Yamada. They're a fine family
in Japan I have tea with.

20:27.701 --> 20:29.868
How did you find
the dead family?

20:29.936 --> 20:33.470
I was asleep in the ravine and they
appeared like magic,

20:33.538 --> 20:34.505
not far away.

20:34.573 --> 20:36.074
Like magic?

20:36.141 --> 20:39.010
A sorcerer brought them
in a base camp of pleasure

20:39.078 --> 20:41.179
and left them
in a state of peace.

20:41.246 --> 20:45.349
Tell me, what color
was the base camp of pleasure?

20:45.417 --> 20:50.754
Dark as the midnight sky.

20:52.123 --> 20:53.757
I say he's guilty.

20:53.825 --> 20:56.526
We're testing the dried blood
on his jacket right now

20:56.594 --> 20:58.829
for a match with the Yamadas.

20:59.764 --> 21:01.732
It's not him.

21:01.799 --> 21:03.533
Are you sure?

21:03.601 --> 21:05.935
He sounds wacky enough
to have done it.

21:06.002 --> 21:07.636
No, his thought process
is too disorganized.

21:07.704 --> 21:09.961
There's no way he's capable
of holding a family captive

21:09.986 --> 21:11.006
for multiple days.

21:11.007 --> 21:13.876
But he talked about
the bodies being dumped.

21:13.944 --> 21:15.211
He was a witness.

21:15.278 --> 21:17.613
And he describes
the unsub's vehicle.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.181
In the nineties, when minivans were
getting popular,

21:20.249 --> 21:23.718
the automakers in Japan called
them base camps of pleasure.

21:23.786 --> 21:26.454
We're ready
to give the profile.

21:29.524 --> 21:31.926
Do you want money
from my parents?

21:31.994 --> 21:34.963
No. Two more guesses.

21:35.030 --> 21:37.264
Do you have a crush
on Mackenzie?

21:37.331 --> 21:38.966
No.

21:39.033 --> 21:40.333
Last guess.

21:40.401 --> 21:42.535
Want to try?

21:44.472 --> 21:46.606
Do you know about
the Samurai?

21:47.941 --> 21:52.779
They were warriors
who believed in loyalty and honor.

21:52.846 --> 21:55.982
Their job was to protect
their lord and his family

21:56.049 --> 21:59.918
and to kill themselves
in shame if they failed.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.688
Would you like to paint one?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.529
Familicides by non-family
members are rare.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.131
Now, we're looking for
an unsub without a family

22:13.199 --> 22:14.599
who is envious
and wants to destroy

22:14.667 --> 22:16.100
the very thing
that he cannot have.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.569
He was raised
in a dysfunctional family,

22:18.637 --> 22:20.605
which he lost or may have
even murdered.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.939
These abductions
were not random.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.441
He monitored the families
on the Internet

22:23.509 --> 22:26.143
and picked them because
their dynamics mirror his own,

22:26.211 --> 22:28.979
yet they project the appearance
of perfection that he fantasizes about.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.505
He blames these fathers
for their mistakes,

22:31.530 --> 22:33.358
and then he punishes the families

22:33.359 --> 22:35.188
and makes it appear as
if the father is the culprit.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.086
And the young sons
who were abducted

22:37.154 --> 22:40.524
are likely to be surrogates
for the unsub himself.

22:40.591 --> 22:43.348
They may be at the age
he was when the negative

22:43.373 --> 22:45.028
life-threatening event happened.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.462
He connects to them,
therefore he may be

22:46.530 --> 22:48.030
in a state
of arrested development.

22:48.097 --> 22:50.199
This doesn't protect
the kids, however,

22:50.266 --> 22:51.834
as evidenced in the killing
of Scott Yamada.

22:51.901 --> 22:54.770
The unsub may have
seen this death as a merciful act.

22:54.838 --> 22:57.807
He's familiar with the abduction
and body disposal sites,

22:57.874 --> 23:00.175
and there's a secondary
crime scene in between

23:00.243 --> 23:02.076
where he holds and interacts
with the families.

23:02.144 --> 23:04.379
This secondary location
is secluded.

23:04.447 --> 23:06.180
It's been set up in advance
for the crimes

23:06.248 --> 23:08.717
and allows him
to be in complete control.

23:08.784 --> 23:11.052
Our unsub is likely
in his mid-40s,

23:11.119 --> 23:13.588
and he has the intelligence
to plot, plan, and effect

23:13.656 --> 23:15.089
these abductions
and murders.

23:15.157 --> 23:19.192
The vehicle he drives is
a dark minivan or cargo van,

23:19.260 --> 23:21.595
probably with tinted
windows, soundproofing,

23:21.663 --> 23:24.631
and retrofitted with restraints
to hide his victims inside.

23:24.699 --> 23:25.984
And given his timeline,

23:26.009 --> 23:27.942
he's probably already
surveilling his next family.

23:35.242 --> 23:38.378
I just spoke with
Mackenzie Acklin's counselor.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.880
She's been dating a boy
for the past year

23:40.947 --> 23:42.882
who is bad news.

23:42.949 --> 23:44.149
Darren Wilson.

23:44.217 --> 23:45.752
He graduated two years ago.

23:45.819 --> 23:48.488
Has a rap sheet.
He was dealing drugs

23:48.555 --> 23:49.954
to rich kids
and professionals.

23:50.022 --> 23:51.289
Is he still dealing?

23:51.357 --> 23:53.725
Probably so.
He has a job downtown

23:53.793 --> 23:55.126
at a check cashing
place.

23:55.194 --> 23:57.696
Well, apparently Mackenzie has been
getting deeper into drugs.

23:57.764 --> 23:59.631
Maybe she owed
someone money.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.966
The family kidnapping
could be some kind of payback.

24:02.034 --> 24:05.270
It's extreme, but we can't ignore
the criminal element here.

24:05.337 --> 24:07.838
But there's no drug
connection with the Yamadas.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.239
We don't know that.

24:09.307 --> 24:12.142
It's unclear what John Yamada's
cash withdrawals were for.

24:12.210 --> 24:15.245
JJ, let's go talk to Darren.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.054
We gotta get past this.

24:25.122 --> 24:27.724
I don't have to do
anything.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.191
Would you look at me?

24:29.259 --> 24:32.629
Vanessa died yesterday.

24:32.696 --> 24:35.364
Our son
could be dead, too.

24:35.433 --> 24:40.068
I already said I'm sorry.
What--what more do you want?

24:40.136 --> 24:43.939
I want you to suffer.

24:44.006 --> 24:46.575
I want you to crawl
across broken glass.

24:46.643 --> 24:48.276
I want you to know
what it feels like

24:48.344 --> 24:51.680
to have your heart
ripped out of your chest!

24:51.748 --> 24:53.114
Go ahead, I'll take it.
Go ahead.

24:53.182 --> 24:55.149
Stop it, mom, stop!

24:55.216 --> 24:56.851
Vanessa came on to him.

24:56.919 --> 24:58.218
I saw it.

24:58.286 --> 25:01.556
Mackenzie, I don't care
if she was dancing naked

25:01.623 --> 25:03.257
with the keys to
a Ferrari in her mouth.

25:03.325 --> 25:04.826
You should have said,
no, thank you.

25:04.893 --> 25:08.729
I am a married man
and stay the hell away.

25:11.966 --> 25:14.534
What is that?

25:17.738 --> 25:20.740
Those are my painkillers
from my surgery two years ago.

25:20.808 --> 25:24.177
I thought you said
the housekeeper stole them.

25:24.244 --> 25:27.680
Tell her what really
happened, Mackenzie.

25:27.747 --> 25:31.283
I took them to get high.

25:31.351 --> 25:33.686
Why does this even matter
to you?

25:33.753 --> 25:35.721
Give me my brother back,
you creep!

25:35.789 --> 25:38.357
You said you didn't start
taking drugs until last year.

25:38.424 --> 25:40.125
Yeah, well, I lied.

25:40.193 --> 25:42.193
Your pills were
the first drugs I ever took.

25:42.260 --> 25:43.862
Did you know about this?

25:43.929 --> 25:46.130
Stop! Stop blaming dad
for everything.

25:46.198 --> 25:48.032
Are you implying
this is my fault?

25:48.100 --> 25:50.635
Yeah. Maybe I am.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.504
Maybe I took them
to see if you'd notice.

25:52.571 --> 25:53.771
If I'd notice?

25:53.839 --> 25:55.272
God, you are so checked out.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.041
I even thought about setting
the house on fire once.

25:57.109 --> 25:59.042
I'd just had a hysterectomy!

25:59.110 --> 26:00.851
No! No, you've been like
this fake person behind

26:00.876 --> 26:02.646
a fake smile forever.
Oh, don't try to turn this around.

26:02.647 --> 26:04.815
I've done back flips
trying to help you!

26:04.883 --> 26:08.318
Do you know hard it's been keeping
your addiction a secret from everyone?

26:08.386 --> 26:11.955
Why do you care about that?
You're so concerned about appearances.

26:12.023 --> 26:13.390
It doesn't matter!

26:13.457 --> 26:15.224
Are you so naive as to
think that our daughter

26:15.291 --> 26:17.827
could go to a good school
and--and have a decent job

26:17.895 --> 26:20.763
when the world knows
that she is a junkie?

26:20.831 --> 26:23.499
I am trying to protect
her future.

26:23.567 --> 26:26.035
Why don't you try
being her mother,

26:26.102 --> 26:30.339
taking care of her now?

26:33.709 --> 26:36.845
We're agents Rossi
and Jareau from the FBI.

26:36.913 --> 26:38.980
We need to talk
to Darren Wilson.

26:39.049 --> 26:40.382
He's not here.

26:40.450 --> 26:42.617
We were told
he was working this shift.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.986
He didn't show.
I'm filling in.

26:45.055 --> 26:46.421
Is Wilson absent a lot?

26:46.488 --> 26:48.689
What can I say?
He's a bad-ass kid

26:48.757 --> 26:51.725
who gets away with murder 'cause
his Uncle owns the joint.

26:51.793 --> 26:54.695
Do you know this girl?
You seen her around?

26:54.763 --> 26:56.864
No, but I've seen
that woman.

26:56.932 --> 26:58.066
When?

26:58.133 --> 27:00.368
Two weeks ago.
She came in for a loan.

27:00.436 --> 27:02.335
5 Gs. I wrote it up.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.204
And when was that loan due?

27:04.272 --> 27:07.006
Last Friday.
She didn't pay it back.

27:07.075 --> 27:09.042
Hmm.

27:09.110 --> 27:10.910
Thank you.

27:10.978 --> 27:13.280
Rossi.

27:13.347 --> 27:16.516
Copy that.

27:16.584 --> 27:19.051
The police just found
the body of Vanessa Hall,

27:19.119 --> 27:20.553
Braden Acklin's tutor,

27:20.620 --> 27:22.955
dumped on Route 32.

28:03.941 --> 28:06.818
'cause of death is a 9-millimeter
gunshot to the chest.

28:07.164 --> 28:08.113
Same as the other victims.

28:08.138 --> 28:09.952
Seems to be our unsub's
weapon of choice.

28:10.535 --> 28:11.901
T.O.D. is less than
24 hours ago.

28:11.968 --> 28:15.938
Looks like she was bound
at the wrist and ankles, premortem.

28:16.005 --> 28:16.939
Was she tortured?

28:17.006 --> 28:18.441
No clear sign of it,

28:18.508 --> 28:21.109
but she has bruising
and torn hair follicles

28:21.177 --> 28:22.545
from fighting her assailant.

28:22.612 --> 28:24.346
There's also motile semen
present.

28:24.414 --> 28:27.782
So it's possible she was
raped before she was killed.

28:28.784 --> 28:30.785
We've sent a sample
to the lab.

28:30.853 --> 28:32.854
You're on speaker, Garcia.

28:32.922 --> 28:35.523
I was just looking through
Vanessa's cell phone records,

28:35.591 --> 28:38.560
and she got a text message
the night the Acklins were abducted.

28:38.627 --> 28:39.594
Who was it from?

28:39.662 --> 28:41.362
Ross Acklin.
That's Mike's brother.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.064
You've already
talked to him.

28:43.131 --> 28:46.667
"Meet at the Red Rose
Motel, room 8, 10 a.m."

28:46.734 --> 28:48.902
Were you sleeping
with Vanessa?

28:48.970 --> 28:51.204
No.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.239
But Mike was.

28:53.307 --> 28:55.876
I was setting up
a meeting for them.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.110
Why would you do that?

28:57.178 --> 29:00.913
He was worried that Debra
would check his cell phone.

29:00.981 --> 29:02.582
I wouldn't put it past her.

29:02.649 --> 29:04.617
So you don't like her
very much.

29:04.685 --> 29:08.187
All she did was ride Mike about
money and spend it like crazy.

29:08.254 --> 29:09.588
So you did him
this big favor

29:09.655 --> 29:11.357
because you don't
care for his wife.

29:11.424 --> 29:13.758
Look, I didn't want to.
Mikey begged me.

29:13.826 --> 29:15.727
So why didn't you mention
any of this before?

29:15.795 --> 29:18.130
It wasn't relevant.

29:18.198 --> 29:19.365
I...

29:19.432 --> 29:21.467
I mean lots of guys
have affairs.

29:21.534 --> 29:23.033
According to her roommate,

29:23.058 --> 29:25.305
Vanessa went to the Red Rose
Motel and was never seen again.

29:25.670 --> 29:27.736
If Mike was already missing,

29:27.761 --> 29:29.374
you're the only one
who knew she was there.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.642
What, you think
I killed her?

29:31.710 --> 29:32.910
Maybe you killed them all.

29:32.978 --> 29:35.079
Mike had a family.
He had a young girlfriend.

29:35.147 --> 29:36.514
As far as I can tell,
you have no one.

29:36.581 --> 29:38.016
Maybe he had everything,
you had nothing.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.449
Maybe you raped Vanessa
before you killed her.

29:39.517 --> 29:41.684
I've been harassing
the police,

29:41.752 --> 29:44.388
trying to get them
to investigate.

29:44.455 --> 29:46.956
Why would I do that
if I were guilty?

29:54.798 --> 29:56.698
The semen analysis came back.

29:56.766 --> 29:59.035
It matches a DNA sample
from Mike Acklin

29:59.102 --> 30:01.637
we picked up at his house.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.474
No. You know what?

30:05.542 --> 30:08.710
I refuse to be your scapegoat
anymore, Mackenzie.

30:08.778 --> 30:10.212
I did not cause
your problems.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.213
Of course not, Mom,
because you are so perfect.

30:12.281 --> 30:15.450
Stop. Just stop it.
Both of you, stop, stop.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.588
We don't know what
he's done to Braden.

30:20.656 --> 30:24.592
Why are we here? He told us
to ask ourselves that.

30:26.295 --> 30:28.495
Maybe it is my fault.
I...

30:28.563 --> 30:32.566
I've been an inadequate
husband and father,

30:32.633 --> 30:33.833
I admit that.

30:33.901 --> 30:36.636
I'm sorry.

30:36.704 --> 30:40.040
I'm so sorry.

30:40.108 --> 30:42.376
I'm sorry, too, Dad.

30:42.444 --> 30:46.279
Is this what you want?!

30:46.346 --> 30:49.782
To watch us break down?

30:49.849 --> 30:51.551
Darren?

30:51.618 --> 30:53.419
Aah! Darren!

30:57.324 --> 31:01.293
So, Debra Acklin borrows
5 grand from a loan shark,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.361
which she should have
paid back 5 days ago.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.430
Talk about asking
to get murdered.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.132
Yeah, but if this
was about the money,

31:07.200 --> 31:08.666
why did the unsub
kill the tutor?

31:08.734 --> 31:09.919
That's a good question.

31:09.944 --> 31:11.915
I mean, how does this
relate to the Yamadas?

31:12.004 --> 31:14.706
The fact is, both families had more.
problems than they were letting on.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.373
Which the unsub
was privy to,

31:16.441 --> 31:18.209
otherwise why murder
the tutor?

31:18.276 --> 31:20.311
The unsub knew
about the affair.

31:20.378 --> 31:23.014
And John Yamada was made
to look like a family annihilator.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.883
It's a way of shaming him,
forcing him to take responsibility.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.385
He wasn't jealous of the families,
he was angry at them,

31:28.453 --> 31:30.387
making them pay a price
for their mistakes.

31:30.455 --> 31:33.523
And he would use anyone in
the family's periphery to do so.

31:33.591 --> 31:35.970
We should see if any recent
homicides are connected

31:35.995 --> 31:36.660
to the Yamadas.

31:36.661 --> 31:38.394
So this guy was doing more
than stalking them online.

31:38.462 --> 31:41.598
He knew their secrets.
But how?

31:41.666 --> 31:43.967
You have a choice, Debra.

31:44.035 --> 31:48.337
You can save him
or you can have the money.

31:48.404 --> 31:49.571
Think about it.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.573
Mom--mom, you have to
save him.

31:51.642 --> 31:53.442
Why?

31:53.510 --> 31:55.577
Why should I?

31:55.646 --> 31:59.115
He is the reason that
you got hooked on pot

31:59.182 --> 32:00.116
no.
And cocaine

32:00.183 --> 32:01.350
and God knows
what else.

32:01.417 --> 32:02.852
No, no, no, mom,
it's not like that.

32:02.919 --> 32:04.119
Please, I love him.

32:04.186 --> 32:05.720
You love him?
Mackenzie, he's a lowlife.

32:05.788 --> 32:08.222
He's a lowlife
and I despise him.

32:08.290 --> 32:10.025
No. I don't have to think about it.
I'll take the money.

32:10.092 --> 32:12.493
No! No, mom, please,
you can't, you can't!

32:12.561 --> 32:16.931
Remember, you're choosing
the money over someone's son.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.366
Mom, mommy!
I don't care.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.668
No, no, I'm doing us
all a favor.

32:20.735 --> 32:23.570
Darren, no! No!

32:23.638 --> 32:25.873
I'm gonna save us.
I'm doing us all a favor.

32:25.940 --> 32:29.643
Debra Acklin definitely
had a shopping compulsion.

32:29.711 --> 32:32.546
Lots of pricey handbags
and designer clothes

32:32.613 --> 32:36.282
with the tags still on them.

32:36.349 --> 32:37.717
Well, the bed's made,

32:37.785 --> 32:38.985
but it's uneven.

32:39.053 --> 32:40.452
Only one person's
been sleeping here.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.921
My guess
is it's Debra.

32:41.989 --> 32:43.455
That would explain the pillow
and the blankets

32:43.523 --> 32:44.891
down in Mike's office.

32:44.958 --> 32:47.393
Rossi, this house was built
in the seventies, right?

32:47.460 --> 32:49.328
Looks like it to me.

32:49.396 --> 32:51.497
But the interior's
been remodeled.

32:51.565 --> 32:54.733
And I'd say within
the last few years.

33:06.378 --> 33:08.746
It's a powerline
network adaptor.

33:08.814 --> 33:11.015
That's an odd place
for the Internet.

33:11.083 --> 33:14.051
Not if you're John Yamada
and you're camped out here.

33:19.657 --> 33:21.258
Look at this.

33:21.326 --> 33:22.927
Point spreads
for NFL games.

33:22.994 --> 33:25.195
John was gambling
the family money away.

33:27.632 --> 33:28.732
Hey, Morgan.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.200
Same here.

33:30.268 --> 33:32.902
Parents sleeping
in different beds.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.538
Was this house
remodeled?

33:34.606 --> 33:37.207
It's a Tudor Revival house,
which means it was built in the 1940s.

33:37.275 --> 33:39.710
But I see hardware fixtures
from the 1980s,

33:39.777 --> 33:41.277
composite window moldings
from 2000--

33:41.345 --> 33:42.845
That would be yes.

33:42.912 --> 33:46.181
Yeah, let me see.

33:55.925 --> 33:58.025
Well, I'll be.

34:25.254 --> 34:27.221
There were cameras
everywhere,

34:27.289 --> 34:30.190
mainly in the lighting
wells and vents.

34:30.257 --> 34:32.757
They did renovations, so
it could have been a contractor.

34:33.661 --> 34:36.029
It'd be easy for someone
with that kind of access

34:36.097 --> 34:37.463
to set up
a surveillance system.

34:37.498 --> 34:39.399
And contractors are people
you can ignore

34:39.466 --> 34:41.634
After they've been
in your house for a while.

34:42.118 --> 34:43.719
You're on speaker,
Penelope.

34:43.721 --> 34:45.266
Your theory is confirmed.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.719
The Yamadas remodeled their
house in 2009, the Acklins in 2010.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.079
The same general contractor?

34:50.177 --> 34:51.596
Uh, negative.
Two different generals.

34:51.597 --> 34:52.724
Some of the same subs-

34:52.748 --> 34:54.748
Hockney Drywall, A.R. Electrical,
Milman and Sons Flooring...

34:57.417 --> 34:59.738
A.R. Electrical,
one of the contractors

34:59.838 --> 35:02.022
who found Scott Yamada's
body at the construction site

35:02.047 --> 35:03.982
was Arthur Rykov.

35:05.624 --> 35:08.426
- We need an address, Garcia.
- Here it comes.

35:09.594 --> 35:11.462
Come on, where are you?
I gave you my answer.

35:11.530 --> 35:12.997
Where is my money?

35:13.065 --> 35:17.267
Isn't the more important
question, "Where is my son?"

35:17.335 --> 35:18.802
What?

35:18.870 --> 35:20.270
Where is he?

35:20.338 --> 35:23.841
You give us back Braden,
you son of a bitch!

35:26.077 --> 35:27.177
Mommy?

35:27.245 --> 35:28.678
Daddy?

35:28.746 --> 35:30.647
Braden. Braden...

35:30.715 --> 35:32.415
What the hell is this?

35:32.483 --> 35:34.750
I'm just confirming
the choice you made.

35:34.818 --> 35:38.354
The money instead of
your son's life.

35:38.421 --> 35:39.956
What?

35:40.023 --> 35:41.724
Braden.

35:50.152 --> 35:51.419
Braden!

35:51.666 --> 35:53.600
Aah! No!

35:55.569 --> 35:58.304
I never said
that I would kill my son.

35:58.371 --> 36:00.740
You were willing to kill
someone's son.

36:00.808 --> 36:02.408
Does it matter which one?

36:02.475 --> 36:04.744
Just tell us what you want
and you can have it!

36:04.812 --> 36:07.646
No, I don't want the money.
I'm so sorry.

36:07.715 --> 36:09.315
I made a terrible mistake.
Please.

36:09.382 --> 36:12.650
Please don't kill
my little Braden. Please...

36:12.719 --> 36:14.786
No!

36:16.388 --> 36:19.124
Arthur Rykov, 46.
Never married,

36:19.192 --> 36:22.227
lives alone
on a 10-acre ranch.

36:22.294 --> 36:23.528
He had a brush
with the law when he was 16,

36:23.596 --> 36:25.831
and that's where we know
most of our info on him.

36:25.898 --> 36:27.698
What happened
when he was 16?

36:27.766 --> 36:30.234
He was questioned by police
regarding an assault

36:30.301 --> 36:31.568
on a teacher at his school.

36:31.636 --> 36:33.337
After his mother died,
he was raised

36:33.404 --> 36:35.639
by his strict
Russian Orthodox father,

36:35.707 --> 36:39.643
who saw his son as an obstacle
to his religious devotion.

36:39.711 --> 36:41.645
Rykov says he fell in love

36:41.713 --> 36:45.648
with the perfect family
across the street.

36:45.716 --> 36:49.252
He watched them for years,
imagined he was one of them.

36:50.951 --> 36:53.620
Until the day
he saw the teacher

36:53.687 --> 36:58.658
kissing the father
in her car.

36:58.725 --> 37:00.425
So Rykov attacked
the teacher.

37:00.493 --> 37:03.495
He denied it. Police never found
any conclusive evidence, so...

37:03.563 --> 37:05.797
So a 16-year-old boy
takes revenge on a teacher

37:05.865 --> 37:07.499
for ruining his perfect
family.

37:07.567 --> 37:10.135
So he's been looking for another
one to replace them all this time?

37:11.137 --> 37:13.138
If we're here
because of me,

37:13.206 --> 37:15.439
I will take full
responsibility.

37:15.507 --> 37:17.675
Are you changing your mind?

37:17.742 --> 37:19.076
Yes!

37:19.144 --> 37:20.411
That can be done.

37:20.479 --> 37:23.281
But every choice
has a consequence.

37:23.348 --> 37:24.948
I'll do anything.

37:25.016 --> 37:27.751
There's a key
taped under the bar.

37:32.923 --> 37:36.893
Under the stereo is a locked cabinet.
Open it.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.031
Open the box inside.

37:42.099 --> 37:43.200
Open it.

37:47.937 --> 37:50.772
If you all kill
yourselves now,

37:50.840 --> 37:53.875
you can save Braden.

37:57.547 --> 38:00.216
What kind of sick
game are you playing?

38:00.283 --> 38:03.185
This isn't a game.
This is life.

38:03.252 --> 38:04.652
You all turned it
into a game.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.355
No! No, we didn't!

38:07.423 --> 38:09.657
You gambled everything
you had, for what?

38:09.725 --> 38:12.493
A little excitement?

38:12.561 --> 38:14.495
Everyone goes through
stuff like this.

38:14.563 --> 38:16.331
We're--we're human beings.

38:16.398 --> 38:17.732
Things happen!

38:17.799 --> 38:20.567
No, things don't
just happen.

38:20.635 --> 38:23.002
You made choices.

38:23.070 --> 38:26.039
The wrong choices.

38:29.810 --> 38:33.012
Rykov didn't have the social skills
to create his own family.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.581
Well, there's no such thing
as a perfect family.

38:35.649 --> 38:37.182
It's a childhood fantasy.

38:37.251 --> 38:38.417
Maybe he thinks
he can fix them.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.185
That's why
he kidnaps them.

38:40.254 --> 38:41.754
But when he fails,
he has no choice but to kill them.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.656
But why start now?
Why in his mid-40s?

38:43.724 --> 38:46.692
He needed a remote location
to carry out his fantasies.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.361
Right you are, girl wonder.

38:48.428 --> 38:50.396
It looks like he saved up
for the place,

38:50.464 --> 38:52.997
bought it two years ago,
paid all cash.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.267
Hey, the Yamadas were
about to send their daughter

38:55.334 --> 38:57.001
to a boarding school
in Ohio.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.137
That must have been the trigger.
He had to kidnap the family

38:59.204 --> 39:00.605
while they were all
still together.

39:00.673 --> 39:02.807
What have I done?

39:02.875 --> 39:04.476
I drove you all away.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.810
This is all my fault.

39:05.878 --> 39:08.379
No. How is killing ourselves
the right choice?

39:08.446 --> 39:09.813
It doesn't make any sense.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.115
If you truly
loved each other,

39:12.183 --> 39:14.418
you would die
for each other.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.819
Who are you?
Why do you care

39:15.887 --> 39:17.220
how much
we love each other?

39:17.289 --> 39:19.823
Because a family
is a precious gift

39:19.891 --> 39:21.992
you can't take for granted.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.326
Do it, Mike.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.027
Do it, Mike.

39:25.095 --> 39:27.029
Do it now.

39:38.475 --> 39:40.809
Do it.

39:51.654 --> 39:53.121
I can't. I can't.

39:53.189 --> 39:55.690
I won't kill my wife
and child.

39:55.757 --> 39:57.525
You won't save Braden?

39:57.592 --> 40:00.728
Please. He's the only one
of us who's innocent.

40:00.796 --> 40:02.229
Please.

40:02.297 --> 40:04.432
No, I won't choose.
I won't choose.

40:04.499 --> 40:07.368
I love you all.

40:13.374 --> 40:15.208
There was another family
before you

40:15.275 --> 40:17.176
who wouldn't die
for each other,

40:17.244 --> 40:20.580
so they didn't deserve
a chance at happiness.

40:22.683 --> 40:24.050
No!

40:24.117 --> 40:25.952
Aah!

40:27.721 --> 40:31.757
FBI. Show me your hands.

40:31.825 --> 40:34.626
FBI! Back away from her.

40:34.694 --> 40:37.830
Sir, back away.
Let me help her.

40:37.897 --> 40:40.198
I shot myself.

40:40.266 --> 40:41.734
Stand up.

40:43.602 --> 40:47.372
They needed to appreciate
what they had.

40:50.275 --> 40:52.076
There's no blood.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.283
It's loaded with blanks.

41:05.055 --> 41:07.123
Mommy!

41:07.191 --> 41:08.958
Arthur Rykov,

41:09.026 --> 41:10.927
you're under arrest.

41:21.605 --> 41:22.538
There you go.

41:22.606 --> 41:24.707
Braden!

41:29.979 --> 41:33.415
You know, there was
an automatic weapon hidden in the wall.

41:33.482 --> 41:36.217
Rykov could have
killed the family anytime.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.721
I doubt if he would have
let them go.

41:39.789 --> 41:42.223
"One of the deep
secrets of life

41:42.291 --> 41:44.225
"is that all
that is really worth doing

41:44.293 --> 41:46.561
is what we do for others."

41:46.629 --> 41:49.430
Lewis Carroll.

41:54.436 --> 41:56.537
- Hello, family.
- Hi.

41:56.604 --> 41:59.039
I would just like to say that I
love each and every one of you,

41:59.106 --> 42:01.542
even you, Dr. Alex Blake.
It's a new love, but still.

42:01.609 --> 42:04.577
And I am never going to take
any of you for granted ever.

42:04.645 --> 42:07.346
Ohh. We love you, too,
Penelope.

42:07.414 --> 42:09.181
Thank you. Now hug me.

42:09.249 --> 42:10.516
Ok.

42:10.584 --> 42:12.852
Does this mean we get
drinks every time we come home?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.286
We will discuss it
when you hug me.

42:14.354 --> 42:15.521
You're too sweet,
baby girl.

42:15.589 --> 42:17.723
Cheers.
Cheers.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.894
The director's been named
new head of acquisitions at the museum,

42:22.962 --> 42:25.163
so that's why there's
an opening at the gallery--

42:25.230 --> 42:26.698
You're taking this job.

42:26.766 --> 42:28.467
Could you be a little
less enthusiastic?

42:28.534 --> 42:30.535
- It's in New York.
- But it's a great opportunity.

42:30.603 --> 42:34.673
But I probably skipped the step
where you want me to ask you to stay.

42:35.941 --> 42:39.710
Ok, Mr. Profiler,
what else am I thinking?

42:39.778 --> 42:41.378
Oh, I have no idea
what you're thinking,

42:41.446 --> 42:44.214
but I think it would be
inconsiderate

42:44.282 --> 42:46.550
to not think
what was best for you.

42:48.286 --> 42:51.488
But I feel like this is the start
of good-bye.

42:51.555 --> 42:52.822
I may get
my heart broken.

42:52.890 --> 42:54.390
You're not gonna get rid
of me that easily.

42:54.458 --> 42:55.792
What are you saying?

42:55.860 --> 42:57.627
New York
is a train ride away.

42:57.695 --> 42:59.996
I can be there
every chance I have.

43:02.065 --> 43:04.166
You really think
we can pull it off?

43:04.234 --> 43:06.435
Sure. Why not?

43:09.205 --> 43:10.372
Um...

43:13.843 --> 43:16.077
my 2:00 just canceled.

43:16.145 --> 43:18.346
I got a train schedule
at my house.

43:18.414 --> 43:19.848
You want to
take a look at it?

43:19.916 --> 43:21.517
I think we have to.
