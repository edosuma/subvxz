00:01.551 --> 00:03.610
I have my own room at Mom's house, too.

00:03.719 --> 00:06.211
My dad doesn't. His stuff's in the garage.

00:06.823 --> 00:09.348
Do you know how to play Vampire Hunter?
'Cause I just got it.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.859
No, sorry.

00:10.927 --> 00:14.727
You got to chop off their heads.
Otherwise they'll keep coming at you.

00:14.798 --> 00:17.289
Do you know where your uncle keeps
the paper towels?

00:17.400 --> 00:19.698
I think there's some up there.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:29.045 --> 00:32.208
Hi. You must be Alan. I'm Cindy.

00:32.749 --> 00:33.875
Hi.

00:34.751 --> 00:37.777
- Hey, Jake, it's time to get dressed.
- Wait a minute.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.890
Can you get me a bowl
from that top shelf?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.186
Come on, let's go.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.093
What happened to "Breakfast
is the most important meal of the day"?

00:48.198 --> 00:50.189
Just go get dressed.

00:50.266 --> 00:53.258
Charlie, there is a half-naked woman
in our kitchen.

00:53.369 --> 00:54.802
Which half?

00:57.373 --> 00:59.398
- Hey, Cindy.
- Hey, Charlie.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.706
- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about yourself?

01:01.778 --> 01:04.406
Pretty good. Thanks again.

01:04.547 --> 01:06.538
- I'll see you soon.
- Anytime.

01:06.616 --> 01:07.640
Bye.

01:11.454 --> 01:13.945
"How you doing"? "Thanks again"?

01:14.090 --> 01:17.423
Charlie, casual sex is one thing,
but this is just lazy.

01:17.794 --> 01:20.456
What are you talking about?
I didn't have sex with her.

01:20.563 --> 01:23.760
She just surfs out on the Point,
uses my shower and goes to work.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.596
So you're not sleeping with her?

01:25.668 --> 01:30.128
Jeez, Alan, I don't sleep with every
buff surfer chick that uses my shower.

01:30.306 --> 01:32.137
What kind of guy do you think I am?

01:32.242 --> 01:36.008
I think you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the face of the earth, but,

01:36.112 --> 01:40.105
that's not my point. I don't want women
flashing their butt tattoos at my son.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.651
- Cindy has a tattoo?
- Yes, a butterfly.

01:43.319 --> 01:45.514
Right cheek or left?
No, wait, don't tell me.

01:45.622 --> 01:47.146
I want to be surprised.

01:47.824 --> 01:50.691
So you're not sleeping with her,
but you want to.

01:51.327 --> 01:52.521
Yeah.

01:53.463 --> 01:55.624
What kind of guy do you think I am?

01:56.666 --> 01:59.464
When I moved in here,
I said it was vital that we create

01:59.536 --> 02:02.334
a wholesome atmosphere for Jake.
And you said, "I understand. "

02:02.438 --> 02:04.929
Alan, there's something
you should know about me.

02:05.008 --> 02:07.943
When I say I understand,
it doesn't mean I agree.

02:08.011 --> 02:11.674
It doesn't mean I understand.
It doesn't even mean I'm listening.

02:12.482 --> 02:13.813
Then why do you say it?

02:13.883 --> 02:17.375
It seems to make people happy,
and that's what I'm all about.

02:17.487 --> 02:21.116
That's very altruistic, but I would prefer
if you'd just be straight with me.

02:21.191 --> 02:23.284
- Fine.
- All I'm asking is that you keep in mind

02:23.359 --> 02:25.953
that we have an impressionable
10-year-old boy living here.

02:26.029 --> 02:27.792
- I understand.
- Thank you.

02:47.350 --> 02:49.545
- That sounds nice.
- Thanks.

02:49.986 --> 02:52.079
So where are Jake and Alan today?

02:52.188 --> 02:54.918
Jake's at school and Alan's at work.

02:55.558 --> 02:56.820
It's just you and me.

02:56.893 --> 02:59.657
Tell them I said hi.
Thanks again for the shower.

02:59.729 --> 03:01.424
You bet. You look really nice.

03:01.531 --> 03:02.998
Thank you. Bye.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.563
Yeah, I got work to do.

03:08.872 --> 03:13.036
Charlie, seeing you strike out
like that just makes me love you more.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.678
Rose, you've got to get a hobby.

03:17.914 --> 03:19.575
I've got a hobby.

03:21.551 --> 03:24.281
- I thought we agreed we were just friends.
- We are.

03:24.387 --> 03:26.355
We're friends who slept together once

03:26.422 --> 03:29.050
and then one friend never called
the other friend,

03:29.125 --> 03:31.685
but luckily, the other friend forgave him.

03:33.229 --> 03:34.628
Where are you going?

03:34.731 --> 03:36.892
To make my friend
a grilled cheese sandwich.

03:36.966 --> 03:40.129
Rose, I don't want
a grilled cheese sandwich.

03:40.236 --> 03:42.067
Would you prefer a quesadilla?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.605
That sounds nice.

03:45.241 --> 03:47.072
But then you have to leave.

03:51.414 --> 03:53.644
Hey, Judith. Alan's at work.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.877
I know where Alan is.
I came to talk to you.

03:55.952 --> 03:58.819
- Me? But you don't like me.
- I don't.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.387
I like you.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.156
Jake's fourth grade class
was given a simple assignment.

04:07.263 --> 04:10.061
Draw something interesting
you see around the house.

04:10.133 --> 04:13.466
One child drew a record player,
another drew a parrot.

04:13.569 --> 04:15.400
My son drew this.

04:18.774 --> 04:21.300
A woman's behind with a butterfly tattoo.

04:22.278 --> 04:23.768
On the right cheek.

04:26.149 --> 04:28.242
I'll have to just act surprised.

04:29.319 --> 04:33.255
I asked him where he saw this.
He said, "In Uncle Charlie's kitchen. "

04:33.823 --> 04:36.815
You gotta admit,
it beats the hell out of a parrot.

04:36.993 --> 04:38.984
Charlie, I am not in the mood.

04:39.295 --> 04:41.422
- Hold that thought.
- I got it.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.593
Hello.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.931
Are you in for your mother?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.838
Charlie's in a meeting right now.
But you can talk to me.

04:53.943 --> 04:56.605
Heck, I feel like we're practically related.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.515
- Is that the girl in the picture?
- Rose?

05:00.817 --> 05:03.377
No. She doesn't have a tattoo on her butt.

05:04.354 --> 05:05.844
I'm guessing.

05:07.123 --> 05:09.557
Look, I don't care what you do
in your private time,

05:09.659 --> 05:12.457
but when my son is here,
I expect you to clean up your act.

05:12.528 --> 05:14.860
- I understand.
- I don't like coming over here

05:14.964 --> 05:17.990
and being the bad guy,
but I have to protect my son.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.395
I understand.

05:20.336 --> 05:23.737
It's hard enough going through
this transition all by myself.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.172
Alan at least has you, I have no one.

05:26.509 --> 05:29.307
Except my parents,
and they're completely toxic.

05:29.379 --> 05:30.641
I understand.

05:31.547 --> 05:32.809
Do you?

05:33.549 --> 05:35.073
I think I do.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.383
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

05:38.855 --> 05:42.154
I mean, I've always been
the good daughter or the good wife.

05:42.225 --> 05:43.317
And you know what?

05:43.393 --> 05:46.362
Outside of those relationships,
I don't know who I am.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.159
Am I gay, am I straight?
Who the hell knows?

05:49.766 --> 05:53.532
I'm scared about this, Charlie,
and I'm totally alone.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.100
You know what?

05:59.008 --> 06:00.737
I understand.

06:07.383 --> 06:09.476
Thank you for listening.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.319
Hey.

06:12.488 --> 06:15.252
I'm so sorry to take up your time
with all of this.

06:15.358 --> 06:16.586
Hey.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.521
I understand.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.164
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

06:30.239 --> 06:33.265
There's five minutes of my life
I'll never get back.

06:34.377 --> 06:37.278
Don't fill up. Your mom's taking us
out for lunch.

06:45.855 --> 06:47.618
Hey. Where have you been?

06:48.091 --> 06:50.924
I just had lunch with my mother
and my stalker.

06:53.262 --> 06:56.595
They spent the afternoon eating off
each other's plates

06:56.699 --> 06:58.860
and discussing my fear of intimacy.

06:59.869 --> 07:01.700
You do have that, you know.

07:02.605 --> 07:05.768
Anyway, look, can we talk
about this picture Jake drew?

07:05.975 --> 07:10.241
What's to talk about? He's a boy.
He saw a woman's ass. He liked it.

07:12.815 --> 07:16.478
Thank your lucky stars
it wasn't the cable guy's ass, and move on.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.252
Hey, Dad. Where's Cankun?

07:24.393 --> 07:25.951
CancÃºn?

07:26.095 --> 07:27.790
No, it's spelled Cankun.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.990
It's in Mexico. Why?

07:31.100 --> 07:34.126
We should go there for Christmas
instead of Aunt Betty's.

07:34.237 --> 07:36.569
<i>- What are you reading?
- Sports Illustrated.</i>

07:36.639 --> 07:39.130
But it's mostly ladies in bathing suits.

07:39.475 --> 07:41.409
Jake. Come back here.

07:41.777 --> 07:42.903
Are you happy?

07:42.979 --> 07:46.107
I have my moments,
but they're becoming further apart.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.245
- Jake, sit down.
- Am I in trouble?

07:50.319 --> 07:54.483
No. It's perfectly natural for you
to be interested in women's bodies.

07:54.590 --> 07:56.683
- Great. I'll be in my room.
- Wait.

07:57.693 --> 07:59.661
Let's talk a minute here.

07:59.762 --> 08:01.855
I don't mind you
looking at these pictures,

08:01.964 --> 08:04.797
but it's important
that you know what they mean.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.831
I'd like to know that, too, Alan.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.066
Okay. First of all,
real women don't look like this.

08:14.143 --> 08:16.543
These pictures have been retouched
and airbrushed

08:16.646 --> 08:19.843
so that the women look like
they're perfect. But they're really not.

08:19.949 --> 08:22.941
Excuse me, but I met that one,
and she was perfect.

08:24.387 --> 08:26.116
What I'm trying to explain to Jake

08:26.189 --> 08:28.817
is that this is not
what regular women look like.

08:28.891 --> 08:31.291
Then why don't they use regular women?

08:31.360 --> 08:35.318
Because the only way regular women
can sell magazines is door-to-door.

08:41.070 --> 08:45.166
My point is that these women
are three-dimensional human beings.

08:45.241 --> 08:46.640
They're not just sex objects.

08:46.709 --> 08:49.940
Which explains why this one's
on all fours in the surf.

08:51.647 --> 08:55.048
- Are you quite done?
- No. I think you're being very unfair.

08:55.218 --> 08:58.051
These women worked very hard,
ate very little,

08:58.521 --> 09:01.285
and spent a lot of money
to become sex objects.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.654
Those breasts alone cost $10,000.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.127
You can buy these?

09:10.866 --> 09:12.356
Thank you, Charlie.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.729
Some women choose

09:16.339 --> 09:18.398
to make their breasts larger

09:18.507 --> 09:21.874
with what's called surgical implants.

09:22.245 --> 09:24.645
- Why?
- They think bigger is better.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.176
I can see that.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.853
What really matters, Jake,
is what's inside a person.

09:32.922 --> 09:35.584
See, that's the lesson here.
Do you get what I'm saying?

09:35.691 --> 09:37.420
- I think so.
- You're sure?

09:37.526 --> 09:40.154
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I mean...

09:40.229 --> 09:42.459
Do you have any questions?

09:42.798 --> 09:44.993
- Just one.
- Fire away.

09:45.735 --> 09:47.669
Can I have my magazine back?

09:52.742 --> 09:54.369
Congratulations, Alan.

09:54.543 --> 09:57.171
You've managed to take the fun
out of boobs.

10:04.553 --> 10:07.454
Hello. Hi, Judith.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.386
Yeah, I'm so glad you called. I just...
What?

10:12.995 --> 10:14.724
She wants to talk to you.

10:15.765 --> 10:19.098
- Why does my wife want to talk to you?
- I don't know.

10:20.503 --> 10:22.494
Hey, Judith. What's up?

10:25.107 --> 10:26.472
I understand.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.606
What do you understand?

10:29.945 --> 10:31.207
Not a thing.

10:34.283 --> 10:35.614
I understand.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.677
What's she saying?

10:39.155 --> 10:41.521
Hang on, Judith. That's my other line.

10:41.957 --> 10:45.120
She's upset because her parents want
to take Jake to SeaWorld.

10:45.194 --> 10:47.492
She feels like this is crossing a boundary

10:47.596 --> 10:49.587
since they've been
so unsupportive recently.

10:49.665 --> 10:51.929
And she's not sure
if her anger is misplaced.

10:52.001 --> 10:54.128
Since when are you her new best friend?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.932
I don't know.
Something's gone horribly wrong.

11:00.009 --> 11:01.670
Sorry, you were saying?

11:03.012 --> 11:04.479
I understand.

11:07.183 --> 11:11.051
You're the coolest. Love, Cindy.

11:11.887 --> 11:14.447
Are you sure
your nephew's gonna like this?

11:16.225 --> 11:18.125
Who says it's for my nephew?

11:19.128 --> 11:21.460
- You're really cute.
- Good.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.700
I'm sorry there's no waves.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.931
Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna get
my exercise today.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.873
It's a puzzler.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.641
Why don't you open up another
bottle of wine

11:39.749 --> 11:42.115
- and we'll figure something out.
- Okay.

11:46.055 --> 11:48.751
I'm sorry to just drop by,
but I had to talk to somebody.

11:48.858 --> 11:52.259
I just left Jake with my parents
so they could take him to San Diego,

11:52.361 --> 11:54.727
and I got in this terrible argument
with my father.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.527
He thinks it's my fault
that Alan and I are breaking up,

11:57.600 --> 11:59.591
and he knows exactly
how to push my buttons.

11:59.668 --> 12:01.863
The question is
why do I need his approval?

12:01.937 --> 12:04.337
Why do I need approval from any man?

12:08.010 --> 12:09.534
I understand.

12:10.546 --> 12:13.106
Charlie, how could you
possibly understand?

12:13.215 --> 12:15.342
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had company.

12:15.418 --> 12:17.909
No, we were just hanging out. I'm Cindy.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.614
- Hi. Judith.
- Hi.

12:19.688 --> 12:23.249
I've spent the better part of my life
trying to win my father's approval.

12:23.359 --> 12:25.725
- You, too?
- Yeah, I almost married a guy

12:25.828 --> 12:29.320
- just 'cause my father liked him.
- I married a guy just like my father.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.866
- Disaster, right?
- It's his brother.

12:32.768 --> 12:34.929
I met him. He's pretty tightly wound.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.403
- He is.
- Yeah.

12:36.472 --> 12:38.565
- Do you want some wine?
- I want a lot of wine.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.971
Yeah.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.034
You know it's so funny
about relationships and men.

12:43.145 --> 12:45.511
- You just wonder all the time.
- Always.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.747
I do not understand.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.041
Morning, neighbor.

13:19.114 --> 13:21.708
- Charlie's not up yet, Rose.
- Oh, Alan,

13:22.384 --> 13:24.318
don't you think I know that?

13:25.387 --> 13:29.187
I brought a Frisbee for your son.
It's a Glow-in-the-Dark Pro model.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.488
- There are teeth marks in it.
- They're not mine.

13:36.432 --> 13:39.458
Actually, Jake's in San Diego
with his mom's parents.

13:39.935 --> 13:41.766
Boy, that hardly seems fair.

13:41.837 --> 13:44.431
Evelyn never gets any quality time
with him.

13:45.107 --> 13:46.938
- Evelyn?
- Your mom.

13:48.277 --> 13:49.608
I know her name.

13:50.613 --> 13:52.444
But do you know how much
she loves you,

13:52.515 --> 13:55.143
and would appreciate a call
once in a while?

13:56.785 --> 13:58.776
Hi, Alan. Shower open?

13:59.421 --> 14:01.753
- Yeah. Help yourself.
- Hi, Alan.

14:04.293 --> 14:06.284
Judith? What are you doing here?

14:06.395 --> 14:09.296
Cindy's teaching me to surf.
She says I'm a natural.

14:09.398 --> 14:11.662
'Cause she's got
the upper body strength for it.

14:11.734 --> 14:13.531
Nothing like yours.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.469
You will. You just gotta build up your lats.

14:17.473 --> 14:19.031
Wow! They're so firm.

14:20.476 --> 14:24.071
Come on. I'll show you some exercises
before we hit the shower.

14:25.481 --> 14:27.472
So, when's Charlie getting up?

14:28.884 --> 14:30.476
In about nine seconds.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.381
Wake up!

14:35.791 --> 14:38.282
What? I was having a great dream.

14:38.527 --> 14:42.190
Your girlfriend and my wife.
Surfing. Showering. Rubber suits.

14:42.531 --> 14:44.726
Okay. This might be better.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.299
Charlie, you've got to do something.

14:49.772 --> 14:51.637
- You're right.
- Yeah.

14:56.011 --> 14:57.740
Charlie, what are you gonna do?

14:57.846 --> 15:00.007
What do you think? I just woke up.

15:01.050 --> 15:04.417
Come on. They could
be lathering each other up right now!

15:04.620 --> 15:07.282
Alan, you're not helping this go any faster.

15:07.690 --> 15:11.854
I can't believe this is going on
under my own roof. Well, under your roof.

15:12.261 --> 15:14.695
God knows what's going on under my roof.

15:17.032 --> 15:20.490
- You know, there is good news here.
- Really? What's that?

15:20.569 --> 15:23.402
Now we know why
I never got anywhere with Cindy.

15:24.707 --> 15:26.368
Hello? Me?

15:27.543 --> 15:29.067
Okay, listen.

15:29.478 --> 15:31.378
What do we really know here?

15:31.580 --> 15:33.377
Your wife has taken up surfing.

15:33.482 --> 15:35.177
We're good so far, right?

15:36.251 --> 15:38.651
She made a new friend. Still good?

15:39.154 --> 15:40.382
Yeah, I guess.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.984
Do we know for a fact
that they're showering together?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.287
- No.
- Okay.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.628
So what do we know for sure
about Cindy and Judith?

15:52.034 --> 15:55.561
Cindy's not interested in you,
and Judith thinks she's gay.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.170
There you go.

16:07.783 --> 16:09.978
And I got to see penguins and a manta ray.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.146
And I got to pet a shark.
And the coolest thing was the whales.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.849
They splashed everybody.

16:14.957 --> 16:17.858
You could see right through
this one lady's shirt.

16:18.827 --> 16:21.193
And I think maybe she had plants.

16:24.099 --> 16:25.430
Implants.

16:28.937 --> 16:30.302
Yeah. Implants.

16:30.372 --> 16:33.500
I asked Grandma if she had them,
and Grandpa said, "I wish. "

16:35.711 --> 16:39.147
And then she got mad at him
and then they bought me ice cream.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.977
So you had a good trip?

16:41.083 --> 16:44.610
Yeah. When I got home,
I went to the movies with Mom and Cindy.

16:49.024 --> 16:52.016
Wait. You, Mom and Cindy?

16:52.628 --> 16:54.186
There you go.

16:55.731 --> 16:58.564
- She's gonna teach me to surf.
- Of course she is.

16:58.901 --> 17:02.268
She's not gonna be happy
until the whole damn family surfs.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.031
Why don't we give her
Aunt Betty's number?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.337
Squeeze that fat ass into a wet suit.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.779
Here, Jake. Take your pizza
and go watch TV in your room.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.439
Dad said "fat ass. "

17:15.751 --> 17:19.311
You've seen Aunt Betty.
It's not swearing if it's true. Now go.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.319
She gets all bent out of shape
when Cindy

17:22.424 --> 17:25.450
is prancing around here
with her butterfly butt sticking out.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.122
But all of a sudden it's okay,
'cause the butt is on the other foot.

17:29.231 --> 17:30.926
Alan, chill out, buddy.

17:31.033 --> 17:34.298
No! This is the worst kind of hypocrisy
and it will not stand.

17:34.403 --> 17:37.566
Forgive me, Alan,
but that self-righteous attitude

17:37.639 --> 17:40.870
is a big part of what drove Judith away
in the first place.

17:40.943 --> 17:44.242
What? Where did you get...
Where? Did she tell you that?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.542
Hey, girlfriends tell each other everything.

17:49.685 --> 17:51.516
Don't look at me like that.

17:52.588 --> 17:56.422
Listen, if she really is gay,
then there's nothing you can do about it.

17:56.525 --> 18:00.859
Except maybe try and figure out why
a lesbian married you in the first place.

18:02.030 --> 18:05.022
But if she's just experimenting

18:05.100 --> 18:07.864
and you act all loving and supportive,

18:07.936 --> 18:10.530
then maybe she comes back
to the home team.

18:14.076 --> 18:18.240
Or maybe I could find it in my heart
to actually be loving and supportive.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.009
Sure, if you want to reinvent the wheel.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.756
Hey. You know, I would've been more
than happy to drop Jake to your house.

18:28.824 --> 18:30.587
No problem. This worked out great.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.991
I've been surfing all day with Cindy
and we just had a bite to eat.

18:34.062 --> 18:36.963
Isn't that nice. Listen, are you in a hurry?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.296
Because there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.495
No, I guess not. What's up?

18:43.038 --> 18:46.530
I just wanted to let you know that

18:48.477 --> 18:52.311
I'm okay with this. More than okay.

18:52.381 --> 18:57.250
I understand, love and respect you
for your courage

18:57.386 --> 18:59.354
to explore things.

18:59.488 --> 19:02.150
Thank you. I'm really starting to enjoy it.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.660
And I support that.

19:07.129 --> 19:09.393
Yeah, I've only done it
on my knees so far,

19:09.498 --> 19:12.626
but Cindy says I'm almost ready
to try it standing up.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.601
You know what?
I don't need to hear the details.

19:16.371 --> 19:19.932
The more important thing
is that I accept

19:20.008 --> 19:24.707
you and Cindy as lovers.
And more power to you, sister.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.778
You pompous, assuming bastard.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.982
You think I'm sleeping with her?

19:37.125 --> 19:38.422
No.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.355
I just got out of a 12-year marriage
and you think I would jump

19:42.431 --> 19:45.195
into bed with someone I just met?
Man or woman?

19:45.267 --> 19:48.168
- No.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.932
- I am.
- Two women become friends,

19:51.006 --> 19:53.975
and you jump to the conclusion
they're having sex!

19:54.176 --> 19:56.906
Where do you get that kind
of sleazy thinking?

20:02.851 --> 20:05.411
The jogger. The one on the left.

20:05.687 --> 20:06.984
Real?

20:07.556 --> 20:08.818
Good eye.

20:09.925 --> 20:12.553
With the sports bra,
that could have gone either way.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.927
Of course, if they do go either way,
they're usually fake.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.161
Jake, honey, get your stuff,
we're going home.

20:20.269 --> 20:23.602
- Okay. See you, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy. Hey, girlfriend.

20:23.672 --> 20:26.903
Don't "girlfriend" me,
you shallow piece of crap.

20:39.288 --> 20:40.653
Fake.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.722
Real.

20:48.597 --> 20:49.655
Jake.

20:49.765 --> 20:52.757
Who does she think she's kidding
with those things?

20:53.669 --> 20:56.331
Jake, I swear, if you don't stop it,
I'm taking you home.

20:56.438 --> 20:57.666
I understand.

21:29.137 --> 21:30.331
