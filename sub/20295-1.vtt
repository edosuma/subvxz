-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.433
With the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.000
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.033 --> 00:40.967
in a court of law.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.633
-A lot of times when people
come up and say thank you to me,

00:46.667 --> 00:49.167
I always tell them that,
you know, thanks is not needed.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.533
It's just something
that I love to do.

00:51.567 --> 00:54.733
But it just makes you feel
that much better about this job

00:54.767 --> 00:57.267
and what you're doing when,
you know, someone comes up

00:57.300 --> 00:59.400
and just appreciates
everything that you do,

00:59.433 --> 01:02.633
that you're willing to go out
there and put yourself

01:02.667 --> 01:05.400
in dangerous situations
to keep everybody safe.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.400
-(over radio) There he is.
Come behind 405. I'll call it.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.467
-Right now, we've got
two officers in pursuit
of a stolen motorcycle.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.300
-(over radio)
Still continuing eastbound.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.933
-He evaded earlier today
and the officer just
located him.

01:14.967 --> 01:20.067
Right now they're headed
towards Slaughter, doing
about 90 miles an hour.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.333
-(siren wailing)
-(police radio chatter)

01:22.367 --> 01:24.733
-(over radio) Traffic.
We're doing about 70.

01:24.767 --> 01:27.400
(siren wailing)

01:27.433 --> 01:29.533
-(over radio) 92 Unit, over.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.567
-(over radio)
Who's calling a pursuit?

01:34.600 --> 01:36.367
-(over radio)
I lost him in traffic.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.333
He's still eastbound
and approaching 35 somewhere.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.967
-(over radio)
We are terminating pursuit.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.600
-(over radio) Terminated.

01:44.633 --> 01:45.667
-All right.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.500
-(over radio)
We're paused in traffic.

01:47.533 --> 01:49.867
(motorcycle rumbling)

01:49.900 --> 01:51.833
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

01:53.633 --> 01:56.767
-Frank-four-seven.
He just, uh... blew past me.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.200
Four-seven, four-90.
If we're clear to continue,
I'm behind him.

02:00.233 --> 02:04.300
We're still going eastbound
on Slaughter, past 35.

02:06.867 --> 02:10.967
All right, we're coming around
that bend near the school,

02:11.067 --> 02:14.333
and we should be coming up,
it's, uh, Vertex.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.533
We are now going...

02:16.567 --> 02:19.267
Ah, he's about to--
He almost wrecked out.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.333
He's off-road,
driving on the sidewalk.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.133
We are northbound on Vertex.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.700
-(over radio)
Okay, northbound, Vertex.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.067
-Get out of the way.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.867
Still going around
the turnaround.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.333
He almost wrecked out.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.067
And we're still
going around Vertex.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.933
-(over radio) They are still
going around Vertex.

02:58.133 --> 03:01.500
-All right, we just connected...
with Nuckols.

03:01.533 --> 03:04.933
We should be coming
around to... Thaxton,

03:04.967 --> 03:08.267
with speeds about
65 miles an hour,
traffic is light.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.400
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:18.067 --> 03:21.900
All right. Now we're on Thaxton,
coming up to Salt Springs.

03:21.933 --> 03:25.667
Traffic is light.
Sixty... eight miles an hour.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.067
We're still on Thaxton,

03:43.067 --> 03:46.333
coming up to McKinney Falls.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.733
-(tires screech)
-Just wrecked out!

03:47.767 --> 03:51.067
Just wrecked out!
Just wrecked out!
Thaxton and Alum Rock!

03:52.867 --> 03:55.100
-(over radio)
Clear. Wrecked out.

03:57.733 --> 04:01.667
-All right, he's down.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.567
T-boned another vehicle.
Let's get several units here.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.367
-Man: I'm right here!
I'm right here!

04:06.400 --> 04:09.333
-Hey, sir! Come over here,
just have a seat
on the sidewalk for me!

04:09.367 --> 04:11.400
-Woman: Help, please?
-Yes!

04:11.433 --> 04:13.267
-Can you talk to me?

04:13.300 --> 04:14.867
-Can you talk to me, man?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.800
Can you tell me
what your name is?

04:18.267 --> 04:22.267
-Need a trauma kit?
Trauma kit?

04:22.300 --> 04:24.533
-Nah. He's breathing
on his own right now.
-All right.

04:24.567 --> 04:26.100
-I don't see any bleeding.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.933
He's breathing,
though, on his own.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.233
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

04:29.267 --> 04:31.200
-He probably hit the car here,
probably like...

04:31.233 --> 04:34.633
He locked the brakes up
and he was probably doing
about 40 or 50 miles an hour.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.067
Can you get
the driver over here?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.067
They're pretty distraught.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.800
He, uh, evaded
officers earlier today,

04:41.833 --> 04:45.333
and, um, we located him again.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.767
Just keep breathing for me, bud.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.067
Just keep breathing. Okay?

04:50.067 --> 04:51.933
Keep breathing for me.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.433
-He probably hit--
He locked his brakes up,

04:58.467 --> 05:02.300
probably hit the car at about
50 miles an hour or so.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.067
-Has he said anything to you?

05:04.067 --> 05:05.567
-No, but he's breathing
on his own.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.400
-Trauma activation!
Unconscious! Unresponsive!

05:09.400 --> 05:11.267
-Ma'am? Ma'am? Are you okay?

05:11.300 --> 05:13.667
You're okay?
You're not injured or anything?

05:13.700 --> 05:16.067
-(crying)
No. He hit the...
like he hit the back.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.467
-He just hit the side of there.
Did you guys see him
coming down the road?

05:18.500 --> 05:20.633
I didn't see him. I seen
the cop lights last minute,

05:20.667 --> 05:23.533
and I started screaming
for my dad to stop,
but it was too late.

05:23.567 --> 05:26.167
-Okay. All right.
So, you want to come
over here and have a seat?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
We're gonna have some, uh...
Do you want victim services?

05:28.233 --> 05:29.967
We can have them come out here
and talk to you guys.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.733
-Just to make sure
you're okay.
-Is he okay?

05:31.767 --> 05:33.400
-Yeah, they're
still checking him.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.567
They're going to take
him to the hospital.
He's still breathing. Okay?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.967
-You doing all right, sir?
-Yes, I'm okay.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.067
-Did you see him coming down
the road at all?
-No, no.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.967
No. He just kind of came up
on you and struck the side
of your car?

05:42.067 --> 05:43.200
-Yes.
-Okay.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.100
He probably hit you probably
about 50 miles an hour.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.900
-I think so, 'cause I looked
that way, I didn't see nothing,

05:47.933 --> 05:50.500
that's why I decided to cross
and all of a sudden, just hit.

05:50.533 --> 05:54.833
He locked the brakes up,
'cause he was doing
about 60 or 70,

05:54.867 --> 05:58.900
and then he locked the brakes up
and likely hit you about 50
or so miles an hour.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.933
But you guys
aren't injured or anything?

06:00.967 --> 06:02.367
You just have the damage
on your truck?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.100
-Yes.
-Okay.

06:04.133 --> 06:07.433
If you guys can just hold here
on scene, and we'll get with you
here in a second

06:07.467 --> 06:10.233
to deal with the whole process
with the damage to your vehicle.

06:10.267 --> 06:11.933
-Okay. I'm going to use
the phone to call my boss.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.867
-Let him know.
-Okay.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.267
-All right, we'll be
right back with you. Okay?

06:18.233 --> 06:21.400
So, right now, they said
that he may have
a possible back injury.

06:21.433 --> 06:25.100
He is breathing on his own,
and they're still
working on him.

06:25.133 --> 06:28.967
The bike that the license plate
is on is not stolen,

06:29.067 --> 06:34.267
but the license plate returns
to another motorcycle that is
currently reported stolen.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.500
They're transporting to Brack?

06:36.533 --> 06:38.467
-Yeah, we're going to Brack.
Here's his ID if you need it.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.967
Frank-four-seven. They're going
to be transporting one to Brack.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.133
I'm not sure of his injuries,
but possible life-threatening.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.767
-Did he have a helmet on?
-Yeah, he had a helmet on,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.367
so, hopefully, he's okay.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.233
-That's why you don't run
from the police.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.433
-Wearing the badge means
a great deal to me.

06:55.467 --> 06:58.067
It brings a sense of pride
and honor

06:58.067 --> 07:00.833
to serve the community
in the capacity that I do.

07:00.867 --> 07:04.400
Everyday I wake up,
I tell myself, "I can't believe
I'm getting paid to do this."

07:04.433 --> 07:07.400
And it makes me proud to be,
you know, a father

07:07.433 --> 07:10.733
and a role model to my kid.

07:12.267 --> 07:16.900
I just got behind
this car pulling out of
a high narcotics area.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.633
The driver didn't have
a seat belt.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.567
You can see him
fidgeting around
in the front seat,

07:20.600 --> 07:23.067
maybe like he was
trying to conceal something.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.600
We're going to pull him
over right here and see
what he's got going on.

07:25.633 --> 07:26.700
-(over radio)
Three-oh-eight.

07:26.733 --> 07:28.900
-Green Pathfinder. Montclair.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.200
How you doing?
Deputy Rogers, Sheriff's Office.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.567
When we passed you back there,
you didn't have a seat belt on.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.967
Any particular reason?

07:45.067 --> 07:47.500
You just forget
to put it on, or what?

07:47.533 --> 07:50.300
-I just pulled out
of the yard, uh...

07:50.333 --> 07:54.067
I was just putting it on.
I don't know if you seen me
when I didn't put it on?

07:54.067 --> 07:55.633
-Yeah, you didn't have it on.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.067
-Now, you got any
driver's license on you?

07:57.067 --> 07:58.867
-Yeah.
-Okay. Where you headed?

07:58.900 --> 08:00.633
-Well... a city gig.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.067
-Okay.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.967
When was the last time
you smoked in the car?

08:05.067 --> 08:06.567
-Uh...
-Be honest.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.800
-Probably last night.
-Okay.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.100
-Last night.
-License valid?

08:11.133 --> 08:13.167
-Yeah.
-Anything in the car that's
gonna get you in trouble?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.533
-No.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.600
-Y'all smoked
about last night, you said?

08:16.633 --> 08:18.067
-Yeah, I smoked last night.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.567
Go ahead and undo
your seat belt,
let me get you to step out.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.800
-All right.
-Leave all that stuff in there.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.633
-All right.
-Dependent or active?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.500
-Uh, what's...
Oh, I work.

08:26.533 --> 08:29.267
-Okay.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.700
Just turn and face the car.
Nothing's gonna poke,
stick or cut me?

08:31.733 --> 08:33.633
-No.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.367
-Back off the car
just a little bit.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.733
Spread your legs.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.933
Listen. All right?

08:44.967 --> 08:48.100
Just don't get silly.
Fair enough?

08:48.133 --> 08:50.400
-Yeah.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.233
-Let go of that.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.500
-I got him.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.067
-All right.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.700
Here's... rubber meets
the road, brother, all right?

08:59.733 --> 09:01.600
It's time to man up.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.833
Do I need to go in there
and get it, or do you
want to get it?

09:03.867 --> 09:05.733
-Go in and get what?
-What you're holding.

09:05.767 --> 09:07.800
-I felt it.
-Oh, okay.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.067
I mean, I ain't...
You felt nothing.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.700
-I didn't?
-Nu-uh.

09:11.733 --> 09:14.067
-So, you're telling--
-Those are my balls. Oh!

09:14.067 --> 09:15.700
-That's not your balls.

09:15.733 --> 09:19.333
Now listen to me.
I'm giving you a chance
to man up. Okay?

09:19.367 --> 09:22.200
-(mutters) I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.800
-Okay. All right,
we'll check.
-All right.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.800
-It's coming out.
-I know my rights.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.367
-So, I'm gonna have to go
in there and get it?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.900
-I don't know what
you're talking about.
-Okay.

09:29.933 --> 09:31.433
-That's not your nuts.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.833
-Yeah, it is, man.
You're digging
all in my privates, man.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.533
-I can feel it,
and every time I shake...

09:39.567 --> 09:41.300
with your pants.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.667
Ah, man. You got my thing, man.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.067
-It's right there.
I can feel it, man.

09:46.067 --> 09:47.767
-Look, here, man...

09:47.800 --> 09:50.400
-I'll go in there and get.
-Oh Lord! Oh Lord!

09:50.433 --> 09:53.167
-You're going in
my privates part, man.

09:54.267 --> 09:55.600
-He's got it held in there.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.900
-Is it in his--
-Come on, man!

09:57.933 --> 09:59.867
-Come on, man.
You can't do this.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.533
-I feel it in there.
-You can't do this, man.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.867
-Hey, he can't do this.
-Listen to me.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.933
-You can't do this, man.
-Listen to me.

10:06.967 --> 10:08.300
-You can't do this.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.333
-I can't--
-No, I know this, man.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.800
-I'm telling you.
-All right. Come back
around here.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.867
-Listen to me.
I've searched
thousands of people.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.600
There's a big difference
in what you can feel

10:16.633 --> 10:18.467
as a foreign object
and manhood, okay?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.867
Unless you got
some abnormality down there.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.567
-I got something
big down in there.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.433
-So do we need to take you
to jail and strip-search you?

10:24.467 --> 10:26.800
-Then you get
that additional charge?
-Take me to jail for what?

10:26.833 --> 10:29.067
-I know what's in there.
-I don't know what
I'm going to jail for.

10:29.100 --> 10:32.500
I know I'm going to press
charges, though.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.333
I know I'm going
to get a lawyer.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.233
'Cause you're just showing
all my privates, man.

10:36.267 --> 10:37.900
-Nobody's showing 'em.
-It's you.

10:37.933 --> 10:39.733
You all in my drawers.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.933
I'm embarrassed to say it,
but there's a pad that hold--

10:42.967 --> 10:45.467
that I'm leaking. I leak.
There's a pad down there.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.000
-If it's a pad, it's a pad.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.733
But it's funny how you just said
it's a pad, you know?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.867
-Oh!
-Oh, it's a...

10:52.900 --> 10:55.700
-It's a pad, 'cause
your leakage, right?
-Oh Lord.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.233
-So you're telling me
that's not yours?

10:57.267 --> 10:58.833
-Hey, look.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.533
I'm gonna need a witness
'cause they ain't supposed
to do this, man.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.867
I'm gonna need a witness.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.133
-So, is this yours?
I thought you said
it was a pad for leakage.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.067
-Hey, look, man,
you know where you got it from.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.767
-Okay, I got it off of you.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.233
-Out of my nuts.
It was out of my drawers.

11:13.267 --> 11:15.167
-That's right.
-Let's go.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.567
-It was out of my drawers, man.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.900
I ain't no dope dealer.
-And I didn't say you were.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.867
But I knew you had
narcotics down there.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.133
-Oh, you did?
-I did.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.800
I didn't wake up today
and decide to be the police.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.967
-I'm just trying to do
what I need to do, man.

11:26.067 --> 11:29.700
-You know, I can work with that,
but somebody, "I ain't got--"

11:29.733 --> 11:32.067
I mean, come on, you knew
it was coming out, brother.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.700
Ain't nobody who in trouble,
ain't gonna tell on their self.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.833
-But you knew it once I felt it.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.333
-I don't know.
Who gonna tell on their self?

11:39.367 --> 11:41.300
-I don't expect anybody
to tell on themselves.
-Exactly.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.533
You're gonna try your best
to get out what you in.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.300
-But when you're caught,
you're caught. Am I right?

11:45.333 --> 11:49.500
-I wasn't caught, man.
I feel like I was violated,
going to my nuts and stuff.

11:49.533 --> 11:50.900
You know what I'm saying?

11:50.933 --> 11:52.967
You pulling down my pants,
showing my private parts--

11:53.067 --> 11:54.700
-But when I searched,
I felt it.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.667
-Nah. You felt that?

11:56.700 --> 11:59.167
-How are you--
You're saying we put it there?

11:59.200 --> 12:01.233
-No, I ain't saying that.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.733
-And all that over this, really?

12:02.767 --> 12:04.367
-Oh, what?
I didn't do nothing.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.067
If I would've ran
or something,
but I ain't do nothing.

12:07.067 --> 12:10.533
I sat down to try
to get out of the situation.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.367
Play it cool.
And I respect that.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.767
-That's all.
-It is what it is.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.167
-I ain't disrespect
y'all or nothing, man.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.233
-And I didn't disrespect you.
-Nah, we didn't, man.

12:17.267 --> 12:19.633
So, I can't do nothing, man.
I'm caught.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.233
-But own it.
-I'm caught.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.267
-Okay. Give me just a second,
we'll get it all figured out,
all right?

12:24.300 --> 12:25.433
All right, brother.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.133
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

12:28.167 --> 12:29.867
We pulled him over,
no seat belt.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.200
And, I mean, you can smell
the odor of raw marijuana.

12:32.233 --> 12:35.567
And, uh, I pulled him out.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.067
Of course, you could feel
it under there.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.967
He kept saying
there was nothing, nothing.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.267
-28.3
-A decent sized bag.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.200
Felony man-pon if you ask me.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.233
-Um, Evan.
-Yeah?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.867
-You understand
why I went down there.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.167
-Yeah.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.800
-Got to get your head
screwed on straight

12:52.833 --> 12:54.600
and get away from that stuff.

12:54.633 --> 12:55.933
-All right?
-Yes, sir.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.433
I got to tell you,
the man-pon deal,
that's original.

12:58.467 --> 12:59.867
-Original.
-I ain't--

12:59.900 --> 13:02.767
-I had to try it, man.
It was the only thing
I could think of.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.233
-You hear a lot of things,
I've never heard that one.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.667
-I tell you,
you almost had me fooled.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.067
-I did, huh?
-Yeah.

13:08.067 --> 13:11.333
I mean, you were pretty adamant,
there wasn't any drugs.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.100
It was a man-pon
'cause you leaked.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.600
Yeah, I had to try
something, man.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.067
-Any issues down there?

13:16.067 --> 13:17.600
-Nah, nah, nah! (laughs)
-Okay.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.900
-Sometimes you gotta go deep if
you want to get the good stuff.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.833
-I've been working
for Boise PD now for
approximately nine months.

13:25.867 --> 13:28.067
Came up from a California
agency a couple of years ago.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.967
It was a pretty
high-speed agency.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.400
It almost seemed like
we didn't really have
an impact there.

13:32.433 --> 13:35.300
Here in Boise, when you're able
to get dope off the street

13:35.333 --> 13:37.333
or arrest somebody
for any kind of crime,

13:37.367 --> 13:40.100
I really feel that
we're making a difference

13:40.133 --> 13:41.167
here in this community.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.633
-Police radio:
4, William, 1-2.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.100
-Ustick, Cloverdale.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.400
If you can start me
a code 1-1-K9.

13:46.433 --> 13:48.733
Just left a known drug house

13:48.767 --> 13:50.600
and drug neighborhood

13:50.633 --> 13:53.167
and just followed it
out of the neighborhood

13:53.200 --> 13:55.167
and it...

13:55.200 --> 13:57.067
Not using
its turn signal properly.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.267
It also looks like
one of their registered owners

13:59.300 --> 14:00.633
might have a warrant.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.200
So, let's see what's up.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.533
-(police radio chatter)

14:07.833 --> 14:09.067
Do you have
your license on you?

14:09.100 --> 14:10.133
Insurance and registration?

14:10.167 --> 14:11.867
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Can I see
that real quick?

14:11.900 --> 14:14.067
-I have insurance.
I just need to find it.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.367
-Is there a problem?
-I'll explain it to you
in a second, okay?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.600
-(baby crying)

14:17.633 --> 14:18.700
-Hi! Look at my flashlight!

14:18.733 --> 14:21.800
Look! Cool! Red, blue,
how cool is that?

14:21.833 --> 14:23.200
You like that?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.767
-(baby cries)

14:24.800 --> 14:26.067
-Do you have warrants
or something?

14:26.067 --> 14:27.133
-No, no warrants on me.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.767
-Are you on probation
or parole or anything?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.900
Are you good to go?
-I'm good.

14:29.933 --> 14:31.367
-You're good?
-Yes, sir.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.300
-All right. Ma'am,
I'm gonna have you
step out here real quick.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.433
You're not gonna be under arrest
or anything like that, but--

14:35.467 --> 14:38.067
-Sir, her kids has autism.
Her son has autism
and he's crying.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.867
-Okay. It's gonna literally
be like two more minutes.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.300
I'm gonna have
a conversation with her.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.700
Come back here.

14:43.733 --> 14:44.767
Who is this guy to you?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.333
Why is he acting
the way he is?

14:46.367 --> 14:47.667
Where are you guys coming from?

14:47.700 --> 14:49.400
-Um, he--
-Honestly.

14:49.433 --> 14:51.533
-Honestly, I went to
my mom's and then--

14:51.567 --> 14:55.067
Because I got off of work
and I took him,

14:55.067 --> 14:56.300
'cause he was
babysitting my kids,

14:56.333 --> 14:58.700
I took him, um...

14:58.733 --> 15:01.233
to go in to pick up

15:01.267 --> 15:03.200
an alternator for his car,
and then I--

15:03.233 --> 15:04.667
-And that's when
he broke down on Cole?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.333
-Yes. It is--
it's parked at a house.
-Kay.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.600
One of his old friends,
one of his friends.

15:08.633 --> 15:09.900
And then my old neighbor,

15:09.933 --> 15:11.200
he didn't have
the tools to fix it.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.500
It was at my mom's house

15:12.533 --> 15:14.300
and then we were
headed to my house.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.733
-So does he have warrants?

15:15.767 --> 15:17.233
-I think he's on parole,
but I don't know.

15:17.267 --> 15:19.067
-Well, I'm gonna make this
as quick as possible, okay?

15:19.100 --> 15:21.733
I'm gonna have you walk up
and get the kids and then
we're gonna search your car.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.333
I'm gonna make sure
there's nothing in that car

15:23.367 --> 15:24.667
that's not supposed to
be in that car.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.400
Hey, straight up.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.567
-What?
-Who's your parole agent?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
-What are you talking about?

15:34.633 --> 15:35.800
-Who's your parole agent?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.067
-What are you talking about?

15:37.067 --> 15:39.467
-You're on parole,
and who is your parole agent?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.967
-Sheri.
-Sheri who?

15:41.067 --> 15:42.200
-I don't know her last name.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.333
-How? Okay. Are you
absconding or something?

15:44.367 --> 15:45.433
-No.
-Okay.

15:45.467 --> 15:46.700
Are you supposed to
identify yourself

15:46.733 --> 15:48.633
as being on parole
to law enforcement?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.100
-Yeah, I-- Can I be
straight with you, man?

15:50.133 --> 15:52.067
I didn't want you to
be mad at her kids.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.300
-Nothing is gonna happen
to the kids,

15:53.333 --> 15:55.067
but you're making this
a lot more difficult.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.900
Dude, what's all the fuss about?
We're doing our job.

15:56.933 --> 15:59.233
I mean, it's just the way
the day and age going.

15:59.267 --> 16:02.067
Here's a question.
I'm gonna have you
step out of the car.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.500
Do you have anything
illegal on you?
-No.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.167
-If you're good, you're good.
-I am good, man.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.167
-The way you're acting
makes me think you're not good.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.900
-I have-- have--
I've done nothing wrong.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.467
-Well, then what's all
the fuss about, man?
-I'm scared. I don't want--

16:11.500 --> 16:13.467
-For what?
-'Cause I just got out, man.
I'm scared.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.100
I don't wanna go back.
-When did you get out?

16:16.333 --> 16:17.700
-20th... 19th.

16:17.733 --> 16:18.833
-Kay, what'd you go in for?

16:18.867 --> 16:20.633
-Originally for driving
without privileges.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.800
-Kay. That's it?
-And criminal conspiracy
to commit robbery.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.333
-Kay. Step out and turn around,
put your hands behind your head.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.867
So I treat you with respect,
you treat me with respect.
Is that cool?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.100
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

16:30.133 --> 16:32.400
Is there anything illegal
inside the car? Straight up.

16:32.433 --> 16:33.733
-No.
-Kay.

16:33.767 --> 16:34.867
-Thank you, sir.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.433
-We have a drug dog here.
We're gonna search.

16:36.467 --> 16:37.633
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Okay.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.100
Nothing's gonna happen
to her kids.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.200
You working?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.600
-Yeah. I actually
start tomorrow, so.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.133
If I'm not in jail
for some reason.

16:43.167 --> 16:44.467
-Put your arms down.
Come back here.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.800
You know you don't
have warrants.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.200
-I know.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.600
-You wanna grab her
to grab the kids?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.667
Over here. Stand here.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.900
-Have a seat
on the bumper.
Right here.

16:52.933 --> 16:54.533
-Well, as of right now,
you're not in trouble.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.100
You're not in custody.
You're not in handcuffs.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.467
-It's hard, man.
-Yeah?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.333
-20 years old and I've done
four and a half years in prison.

16:59.367 --> 17:00.700
It's like, dude,
give me a break.

17:00.733 --> 17:02.500
-Life is not easy, bud.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.967
But you gotta figure out
what keeps you going

17:05.067 --> 17:07.067
and focus on that
and get away from the dope.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.300
-I'm clean.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.200
-I know, but you're still
hanging out with those people.

17:10.233 --> 17:11.967
You're hanging out
with the people that deal it.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.467
-I don't want to.
I happen to have nothing.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.900
I have nowhere to go.
My mom won't...

17:14.933 --> 17:16.500
-Yeah?
-I can't talk to her.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.767
-She's tired of it.
-No, my mom's a user too.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.767
-Oh.
-I've been clean
since I went to prison.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.700
That girl is
the only reason
I haven't used.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.533
-I suggest if you want
any kind of future,

17:24.567 --> 17:26.067
you get your stuff together.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.633
For her sake
and for the kids' sake, right?

17:27.667 --> 17:29.233
-I'm trying. I'm trying
so hard, man.
-I know.

17:29.267 --> 17:30.467
I'm not here
to wrap you up.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.333
You're not in handcuffs.
You're not in trouble.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.167
If I don't find anything.
You're not going to jail

17:34.200 --> 17:35.267
for not being honest,
you know?

17:35.300 --> 17:36.667
-(dog barks)

17:36.700 --> 17:39.500
-Hey, Alicia, let me make sure
there's nothing in here

17:39.533 --> 17:41.233
and then you can
have it, okay?
-Okay.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.833
-We have a drug K9 here.
We're also gonna sniff the car.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.600
We've been given permission
to search the vehicle

17:45.633 --> 17:47.833
by the registered owner
who's standing out here.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.467
-Is that where everything was?
-Yeah.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.667
-Okay.
-Come on.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.167
-Good girl.
-Good boy.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.800
-(dog whimpers)

18:09.833 --> 18:11.067
-We're just gonna
run through here

18:11.067 --> 18:12.900
and make sure there's
no contraband, drugs,

18:12.933 --> 18:14.767
anything he's not supposed
to have as a parolee,

18:14.800 --> 18:16.400
and then we'll get them
on their way.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.167
So inside, in this silver bag
that was in there,

18:25.200 --> 18:26.900
appears to be
a meth pipe

18:26.933 --> 18:28.567
of some sort
with some residue in it.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.867
No real product in there.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.433
Just a used meth pipe
with a little bit of residue.

18:36.567 --> 18:37.800
-That's a good boy.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.500
-It's right there.
-There's a little bitty hole

18:39.533 --> 18:40.833
once you open the wallet.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.233
There might be dope in there.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.733
Here we go again.

18:49.767 --> 18:51.400
Yup, here we go.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.867
Looks like that baggie is gonna
have a little bit in there.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.833
The bag is fairly empty.

18:55.867 --> 18:57.833
It's probably been used.

18:59.467 --> 19:02.900
-That's a good boy.
That's a good boy.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.233
-Stand up.
Stand up and turn around.
-Can I talk to her please?

19:05.267 --> 19:07.467
-Yeah. She's gonna come.
-Can I give her a hug
and a kiss please?

19:07.500 --> 19:08.500
-Yes, you can.
-Okay.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.700
-In your black wallet,
there's four baggies.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.500
You have got meth
inside of it.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.533
And then inside your bag,
there's all that stuff.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.933
The pipes and all
that kind of stuff.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.267
-What am I being charged with?

19:18.300 --> 19:20.067
-You're gonna be charged
with the paraphernalia

19:20.100 --> 19:22.400
and you're gonna be
charged with possession
of a controlled substance.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.633
Sit down and I'll come bring her
over here to give you a hug.

19:25.967 --> 19:27.667
-Dude, I've lost everything.
I've lost-- That's--

19:27.700 --> 19:28.767
She's the only thing I have.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.067
Then why are you
in possession of it?

19:30.067 --> 19:31.133
Why is it in your wallet?

19:31.167 --> 19:32.367
Were you planning on using?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.867
-I was going to
and I decided not to.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.633
-Okay.
-Dude, it was
so hard not to use.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.500
They're all sitting around
and they're all smoking.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.067
-I know that it's hard.
You're gonna have to cut
all your ties.

19:40.067 --> 19:41.733
-I'm gonna (bleep)
wind up on the (bleep) streets.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.067
-You can turn it around.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.767
You're the only person
that's gonna be able to though.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.067
It's not gonna come for free.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.567
You're gonna have to
work your butt off.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.833
But you can do it,
trust me.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.133
-Officer over radio:
132 and Bush.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.467
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.567
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Cover is code three.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.600
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.833 --> 20:06.833
-Dispatcher:
Okay, still send a code three.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.367
-(theme music playing)
