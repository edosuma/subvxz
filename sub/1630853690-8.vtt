NO TRESPASSING

00:11.886 --> 00:13.263
No, let me in please.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.865
-[officer 1] No, no, no.
-[officer 2] You can't be here.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.408
-[officer 1] Chief!
-[Elisa] Let me by!

00:33.491 --> 00:35.452
-Murillo, you can't be here.
-It's OK.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.788
When did you find the body?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.206
Two hours ago.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.541
[Elisa] Does the family know?

00:41.624 --> 00:43.126
-[mother] Let me go!
-[officer] Wait here, madam.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.211
-[mother] Let me go! My son!
-[father] Let her!

00:45.295 --> 00:47.213
-No, Teresa, no.
-Stop!

00:47.297 --> 00:49.048
[Elisa]
No, don't look. Don't look.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.508
Benjamín, no!

00:50.592 --> 00:52.260
No!

00:52.343 --> 00:53.636
-Teresa...
-No!

00:53.720 --> 00:56.014
Mr. Lira, Mr. Lira. Be careful!

00:56.097 --> 00:57.307
Let me see my son.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.683
-Calm down.
-I want to see my son!

00:58.767 --> 01:01.478
Please, I want to see him.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.813
I don't want him
to be alone there, please!

01:03.897 --> 01:05.607
I don't want him to be alone!

THE PACK

02:05.124 --> 02:06.501
[door closes]

02:22.517 --> 02:24.310
[Marcos] How many times
have you said

02:24.394 --> 02:25.812
you didn't like it in the car?

02:25.895 --> 02:27.480
Hmm?

02:30.900 --> 02:33.862
I haven't stopped watching this,
and you know what?

02:33.945 --> 02:35.989
It's such a strange feeling,
because...

02:36.072 --> 02:39.367
It's like I recognize
all of your moves.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.453
I recognize your mannerisms,
and it's...

02:43.788 --> 02:46.040
It's all so horribly familiar.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.920
Don't do this, please.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.797
I'm going to keep doing it.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.844
You have no right
to deny me anything.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.472
This, I can manage to
understand.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.934
I don't think I'm that basic.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.898
But what I can't understand,
the shit I just don't get,

03:11.482 --> 03:12.859
is how you could fuck this guy

03:12.942 --> 03:16.279
right after our daughters
were in such serious danger.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.323
I ask for your forgiveness,
Marcos.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.120
You were there, and I was here,
taking care of them.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.247
Do you realize how low this is?

03:27.248 --> 03:30.043
Because I work my ass off, too.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.794
I work my ass off
raising the girls

03:31.878 --> 03:34.464
and I don't fuck the first chick
I run into on the street.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.758
I'm not an animal, Carla.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.345
Why?

03:43.264 --> 03:44.349
Why?

03:47.101 --> 03:48.269
It just happened.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.857
-Motherfucker!
-No violence, you hear me?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.150
Hey...

03:54.233 --> 03:57.737
No, don't try to flip this,
I'm not the monster here.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.406
You do realize what this guy
wants to do, right?

04:00.490 --> 04:04.786
That's why he sent you the
video.
He wants ruin this, don't you
see?

04:04.869 --> 04:07.830
That's a shitty argument, Carla,
and you're a coward.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.998
I'm whatever you say I am.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.626
I'm a coward, a piece of shit,
a whore.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.044
I'm whatever you say.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.254
But what he's doing
is toying with us.

04:15.338 --> 04:19.092
Don't try to turn things around,
don't be a hypocrite.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.760
I want to catch
this son of a bitch

04:20.843 --> 04:23.471
to stop him from ruining
our lives and killing people.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.643
I'd love to be as cold as you.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.817
I'm protecting my family.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
What family?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.377
Augusto, something happened.
Your friend...

05:18.568 --> 05:20.194
[sobbing]

05:29.871 --> 05:32.457
Augusto, there's no time.
I need to know if anyone saw
you.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.377
-Answer me!
-No.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.129
-Someone?
-Nobody! Nobody.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.425
Mom...he wanted to confess.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.386
He was going to ruin my life,
Mom.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.937
Put all of those clothes
in plastic bags.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.065
Hand it over to me.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.069
I'll call Eduardo's dad.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.821
So he can get you both
out of here.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.170
Whoever did this
covered their tracks well.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.673
Publicly this could seem
like suicide.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.217
But it's a message.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.763
He wants us to know
how far he's willing to go.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.601
The pattern has changed.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.603
So far, the victims
had only been women.

06:35.686 --> 06:39.315
Yes, but when he co-operated
with us, he betrayed his pack...

06:39.398 --> 06:40.733
his species.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.777
Understand?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.570
And how did they know
he cooperated?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.825
Do you think the murderers
knew him?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.160
I don't know...yet.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.870
If you ask me...

06:52.954 --> 06:54.747
whoever did this...

06:55.957 --> 06:58.126
is directly involved

06:58.209 --> 07:00.419
in Benjamín's testimony.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.464
And The Wolf got scared.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.551
He felt cornered.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.064
You still like yerba-maté?

07:22.441 --> 07:23.901
Whenever I can.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.866
It's been so long
since you came here.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.536
-You should stay, too.
-I can't.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.746
But you told me yourself

07:35.830 --> 07:37.456
that you're no longer
with the PDI.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.001
So stay then.

07:41.169 --> 07:44.797
Stay a while, with your son,
rest together for a few days.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.299
It's all a mess, Mom.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.803
My life is completely
out of control.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.221
Well...

07:52.305 --> 07:55.933
nobody has everything
under control all the time.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.691
What if Gonzalo's like his dad?

08:03.774 --> 08:06.903
No, it's not good for you
to think like that.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.908
I've left him alone too much.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.663
Always working,
always with my mind elsewhere.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.165
Always tired.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.792
The cliché of well-meaning
negligence.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.794
No, no.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.838
You're no cliché.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.090
And you're not a bad mother,
either.

08:28.174 --> 08:32.428
Look, you have a strong
relationship with your son.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.014
What you have to do now

08:35.097 --> 08:38.100
-is work on recovering his
trust.
-[cell phone vibrates]

08:38.184 --> 08:39.810
Sorry, I have to take this.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.440
-Javi?
-Benjamín is dead.

her Jane Doe.

Er... [sniffs]

08:53.783 --> 08:55.493
Did you tell Elisa?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.912
Yes, I did. Actually...

08:57.995 --> 09:00.957
<i>She's at the morgue</i>
<i>analyzing the body with</i>
<i>Jorquera.</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:04.585
-Good.
-Now, if anyone asks--

09:04.669 --> 09:07.296
No, of course, don't worry.
You didn't call us.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
I'm on my way there.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.433
[Olivia]
I have to go back to Santiago.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.061
-What happened?
-Nothing.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.896
This fucking game
has me like this.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.773
Gonzalo...

09:27.775 --> 09:31.570
When this is all sorted out,
I'll come get you.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.825
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

-Carla, I need you at the
station.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.775
<i>I don't get it.</i>
<i>Did something happen?</i>

10:09.859 --> 10:12.653
-<i>Benjamín is dead.</i>
-What?

10:12.737 --> 10:14.280
How?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.157
It'll take me a few hours
to get to Santiago.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.659
I need you to be there
beforehand.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.538
We both quit, what...?
What's up with Elisa's
discharge?

10:22.621 --> 10:26.334
That's not important now. Chief
wants all three of us back, now.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.338
OK.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.714
I'm on my way.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.974
Yes, they're on their way.
They'll be there in a few hours.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.477
Let me know as soon
as the plane takes off, got it?

10:45.561 --> 10:47.104
Well, that needs to be fixed
now.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.981
They need those documents on
site.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.025
No! No, it can't wait.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.651
OK. Yes.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.072
-I don't want to go.
-Calm Down, Eduardo.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.698
I don't want to go. This is
wrong.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.492
-We shouldn't have done this.
-Listen.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.161
We did it out of survival, man.
Survival!

11:02.244 --> 11:04.914
It was us or him, Eduardo.
Don't overthink it.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.795
They'll be expecting you
as soon as you land.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.298
Follow the instructions
and don't contact us.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.716
There'll be time
for details later,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.510
is that clear?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.261
Now get in the car.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.265
Augusto.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.726
We won't be seeing each other
in a long time.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.355
When all this blows over,

11:29.438 --> 11:31.065
you'll receive news from me.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.986
I don't get it.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.863
What happened to you?

11:41.325 --> 11:44.161
Now get in
and control your friend.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.584
Let's go!

11:55.005 --> 11:56.882
Calm down. Calm down!

<i>They kill us and they rape us</i>
<i>And no one does a thing!</i>

12:53.105 --> 12:56.192
You know what I've been
grateful for this whole time?

12:58.277 --> 13:00.529
That you girls love each other
like you do.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.159
All I have left is to ask
for your forgiveness.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.954
For having lied to you.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.081
And for not being able
to help you.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.378
But you have each other.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.467
I'll support you, no matter
what you want to do.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.719
I want to accompany you.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.305
And if you...

13:28.265 --> 13:29.683
...don't want...

13:33.229 --> 13:34.897
...to be close to me...

13:35.981 --> 13:38.275
If you want to distance
yourselves from me...

13:38.359 --> 13:40.110
I understand.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.071
I will understand.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.349
Blanca wants to see you.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.787
[door closes]

14:33.622 --> 14:36.417
Celeste, I'm here to personally
deliver a message.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.586
The Wolf is changing
all the rules.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.171
He's waking up his cubs,
one by one.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.632
OK, but why? What's their plan?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.134
The last move.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.803
Look, if that motherfucker
thinks he can get away with it,

14:47.886 --> 14:50.472
he's very wrong.
We have to fight back.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.768
What's this?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.687
This is a gift, Celeste.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.397
We need you in this fight.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.650
If you want in,
you know where to find me.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.055
-Hello.
-Hello.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.599
I'm looking
for Commissioner Fernández.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.725
She's not here yet.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.186
Someone else can help you
if you want.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.771
No, no, no, it's...

15:40.189 --> 15:42.107
I need to talk to her.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.860
Please call her and tell her
I have important information

15:44.943 --> 15:46.612
regarding Benjamín Lira's death.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.573
Wait a moment, please.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.116
Thank you.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.288
Carla, I have Manuel inside
waiting to give a statement.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.790
He says he has information
about Benjamín.

15:57.873 --> 15:58.916
Can you deal with him?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.502
-I need to go talk to Jorquera.
-No, no, I can't.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.921
Why? It's just taking a
statement.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.881
No, it's just that I... No, no.

16:05.964 --> 16:09.134
I mean, I can't be with Manuel,
much less at the station.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.428
Why?

16:12.971 --> 16:14.264
It's complicated.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.476
Come on, Carla.
Spit it out, what is it?

16:30.447 --> 16:31.699
When?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.409
At the worst possible moment.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.703
And they sent it to Marcos.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.456
OK, um...

16:39.540 --> 16:41.542
I'll deal with it
and we can talk later.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.043
Mm-hm.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.591
Thank you.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.434
I was with Benjamín.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.604
At the hospital,
he went to see Blanca.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.315
His therapist guide went with
him,

17:05.399 --> 17:08.736
but he didn't go up
out of respect, and...

17:08.819 --> 17:10.195
I went up with Benjamín.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.906
And then? Did you see him leave?

17:12.990 --> 17:15.117
No, because we went out
different doors.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.537
There was a lot of press
and his guide was waiting.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.166
I didn't think anything
would happen at the hospital.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.252
And now I've failed him.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.424
-We've all failed Benjamín.
-But I'm his counselor.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.509
My job is supposed to be
taking care

17:32.593 --> 17:34.178
of children in crisis.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.268
But... Um...

17:41.351 --> 17:43.020
That's not why I'm here.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.898
I came because
I have important information.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.484
Right outside the hospital,
on the next street,

17:49.818 --> 17:51.445
Augusto's car was parked there.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.072
Are you sure?

17:54.156 --> 17:57.659
It's a black jeep
with rugby team stickers.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.119
It's hard to miss.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.872
That's very useful to us.
Thank you.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.125
It was revenge.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.506
These...young people,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.883
who looked like normal
teenagers,

18:14.426 --> 18:15.469
they aren't.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.971
They're vengeful.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.014
Violent.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.600
And they won't stop.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.769
It's terrible to think about.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.772
But there are children...

18:27.648 --> 18:29.274
who are destined
to become monsters.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.445
<i>If someone were to tell you</i>
<i>that your son is one of them...</i>

18:34.863 --> 18:36.448
<i>would you do something?</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:39.993
-Why?
-Because it's likely you
wouldn't.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.411
No parent would.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.875
We're weak when it comes
to our children.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.462
Our children remind us
that we're vulnerable.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.799
They're the way into our pain.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.511
It's just a matter of going
in their rooms,

18:57.594 --> 19:00.722
seeing childhood memories,
to be disarmed.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.851
Drawings, notebooks, comic
books.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.896
-Does Gonzalo like comic books?
-Yes, I guess so.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.275
<i>Olivia, Augusto and Eduardo's</i>
<i>parents are here.</i>

19:11.358 --> 19:14.319
OK, I'll be right there. Er...

19:16.113 --> 19:19.032
Thank you so much for coming,
and for all the information.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.620
An officer will escort you
to the exit.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
-Thank you.
-Please go with him.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.670
Get that info for me
and we're all set, OK?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.338
-OK.
-If you can't, talk to López.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.673
-He'll help you.
-OK, fine.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.799
-Thank you.
-Carla.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.928
-Hi.
-How are you?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.390
Can I ask you a favor?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.562
My plane leaves
in a few hours and...

19:51.231 --> 19:52.816
I want to ask you to come with
me.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.320
I don't feel safe
and I'd like to leave this city

19:56.403 --> 19:57.863
without being beaten to death.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.283
The police still do that, right?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.452
Take care of people?

20:16.673 --> 20:19.134
You never get tired
of chasing my son?

20:19.217 --> 20:21.386
And you never get tired
of lying for him?

20:23.597 --> 20:26.391
Tell me, Commissioner.
How can I help you?

20:26.475 --> 20:29.019
Augusto has a black jeep.

20:29.102 --> 20:32.481
License plate FTPL64, right?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.816
I don't know my son's
license plate.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.234
I can imagine.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.822
I have that jeep recorded
by security cameras

20:40.906 --> 20:42.324
near a bridge,

20:42.407 --> 20:45.869
where a group of psychopaths
stoned Benjamín Lira to death.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.122
When? What time did that happen?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.124
Yesterday, at 7:00 p.m.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.794
He was with me.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.756
[Elisa]<i> I'm sure you know</i>
<i>why we're here, Mr. Valenzuela.</i>

20:57.839 --> 20:59.174
General Valenzuela.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.094
Let me tell you something.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.971
We have something in common

21:04.054 --> 21:05.764
and something that sets us
apart.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.810
We both belong
to an armed institution.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.813
Well, you're a simple
policewoman,
I'm a military officer.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.856
But that commits us both
to the integrity

21:14.940 --> 21:16.400
of this nation's citizens.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.736
But you're obsessed
with arresting my son.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.406
You think he's guilty,
you want to go after him.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.616
You don't realize that,
while you do that,

21:24.700 --> 21:27.494
there's a band of criminals
and rapists on the loose.

21:27.577 --> 21:31.206
Because you need someone to
blame
for the press, the TV,

21:31.289 --> 21:33.375
in order to feed
that pathetic circus.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.544
Well, I'm not interested in
that.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.379
I'm a person of principle.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.383
I need to talk
to Eduardo's father,

21:41.466 --> 21:43.802
not to the retired general. OK?

21:46.138 --> 21:50.392
Well, my son is an absolutely
independent young man.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.977
I'm a busy individual.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.353
Very busy.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.438
So call him.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.024
Do your job properly,
locate him, as you wish.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.572
-We'll never be free, man.
-Yes we will, Eduardo.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.199
We're going to be free.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.826
Stop crying.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.204
[Eduardo sobs]

22:12.789 --> 22:14.708
After all, that's what the game
was for.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.961
That's what it was for,
to find out...

22:18.045 --> 22:19.546
who the alphas were.

22:20.797 --> 22:21.965
And we won.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.885
Benjamín was our brother, man.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.428
We betrayed him.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.264
That's the only thing we are,

22:30.557 --> 22:31.975
a pair of motherfucking
traitors.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.646
Do you know what this is,
Mr. Valenzuela?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.237
I have no idea.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.906
It's the plate of the car
that picked up your son Eduardo

22:45.989 --> 22:47.199
and his best friend.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.784
It was quite easy
to trace the call

22:48.867 --> 22:50.494
and hear your voice

22:50.577 --> 22:52.662
asking someone to get him
out of the country.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.665
And since
you're a retired general,

22:55.749 --> 22:58.043
you'll have another weight
on your back:

22:58.126 --> 23:00.087
aiding and abetting a fugitive.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.550
Do you know what's most
important
in a military officer's
training?

23:05.634 --> 23:07.010
Discipline?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.304
That's important,
but it's not everything.

23:09.387 --> 23:12.766
We're proud to be
in an army of warriors.

23:12.849 --> 23:19.064
Real men who are willing to die
before giving up, understand?

23:19.147 --> 23:22.484
Imagine your son is a private,
following your logic.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.821
I'm after the general
giving orders to your son.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.740
I'm not after your son
or your family.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.868
If you give me your son,
you're saving him,

23:31.952 --> 23:33.620
and in doing so,
you save your honor

23:33.703 --> 23:35.580
and your family's honor.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.764
Sorry, it's just a precaution,
that's all.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.437
Everything's fine.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.106
What time does your flight
leave?

24:02.190 --> 24:04.442
Maybe I overreacted...

24:04.526 --> 24:06.945
-I can go to the airport alone.
-No, you're right.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.905
I mean, we don't know

24:08.989 --> 24:10.740
what these idiots
are actually capable of.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.576
They've already attacked you
once.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.328
So I'd rather stay
for your safety.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.330
Well, have a seat while you
wait.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.999
OK.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.586
I know how it feels.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.837
What?

24:26.798 --> 24:28.508
Being scared for your son.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.179
For what he might have done,
or what he might do.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.891
Are we going to have
a moment of sorority?

24:39.686 --> 24:40.854

24:40.937 --> 24:42.981

24:50.906 --> 24:53.074
I have no idea where he is now.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.618
Let me tell you something,

24:54.701 --> 24:56.411
since things are so bad
for you at home.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.414

that only a mother knows

24:59.497 --> 25:00.582

32:52.053 --> 32:54.138
Marcos, go lock yourself
in the bathroom with the girls.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.432
-Where are you, Dani?
-Run!

32:56.516 --> 32:57.558
[gunshot]

32:58.768 --> 32:59.977
[gunshot]

33:01.688 --> 33:03.606
Get in the tub, Dany.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.607
[gunfire continues]

33:09.278 --> 33:10.822
-[Gunshot]
-[Olivia groans]

33:10.905 --> 33:12.657
-[returns fire]
-[attacker groans]

33:16.160 --> 33:18.287
Olivia, Javi here, please
respond.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.332
[ringing tone]

33:26.087 --> 33:27.964
-[Elisa] <i>Javi.</i>
-Elisa, Olivia isn't answering.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.090
Shit, man.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.551
If Manuel crosses the border
our hands are tied.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.553
No, that won't happen.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.891
Hello?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.393
Hello!

33:56.492 --> 33:59.996
[Manuel] Mankind achieved its
domination of this planet by
force

34:00.079 --> 34:01.748
and intelligence.

34:01.831 --> 34:02.999
I'm not the one who says it.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.253
Entire civilizations
have fallen like that.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.797
Thousands of years back this up.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.675
Even if women are trying
to convince us to the contrary.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.762
I have worked at more
than 100 schools, Carla.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.766
I have seen girls...

34:21.017 --> 34:22.393
traumatized,

34:24.228 --> 34:25.480
beaten,

34:26.898 --> 34:30.359
physically and psychologically
abused, even raped.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.986
Even by their fathers.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.492
The only thing
I've learned from all that...

34:38.618 --> 34:41.454
is that if we keep taking
the weak one's side,

34:41.537 --> 34:44.457
we're making ourselves weaker.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.252
[Manuel continues]
<i>We're doing it all wrong.</i>

34:49.796 --> 34:53.090
<i>We're raising little snowflakes.</i>

34:54.550 --> 34:56.260
<i>We should be raising...</i>

34:57.929 --> 34:59.847
wolf packs.

35:01.599 --> 35:05.561
Soldiers, beasts, survivors.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.316
I don't hate women,
I have no reason to.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.988
I simply understand
that they're not made to lead.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.451
It's not even your fault.

35:22.161 --> 35:24.497
It's the biological order,
that's all.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.875
When you ask for justice,

35:30.044 --> 35:32.046
you yell for it.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.714
Justice has to be taken.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.843
By tearing and biting.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.056
Even when you take
the streets to fight, you're
weak.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.395
What the fuck scares you so much
if we're so fragile?

35:47.478 --> 35:50.356
It's not fear,
it's about setting a limit.

35:50.439 --> 35:51.524
Carla.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.236
What the fuck did you think?

35:55.319 --> 35:58.072
That we'd just stand
on the sidelines?

35:59.198 --> 36:03.161
Hmm? While you changed
the order of things?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.163
What was going to fall?

36:06.247 --> 36:07.665
What is going to fall?

36:07.748 --> 36:09.125
The patriarchy?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.716
Stop the car.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.343
Stop it.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.557
Turn off the motor.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.726
Get out. I'll carry on alone.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.688
Get out, Carla.

36:48.664 --> 36:49.999
[Carla sobs]
I'm begging you, please.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.460
-[gunshot]
-[Carla yells, sobs]

37:00.259 --> 37:02.762
-[Carla howls]
-I'm really sorry, Carla.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.932
I would have loved this
to be different.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.438
[Carla] No!

37:36.128 --> 37:37.588
He went that way! Go!

37:37.672 --> 37:39.882
-I'm not leaving you here.
-No...

37:39.966 --> 37:41.467
Tie this into a tourniquet...

37:43.010 --> 37:46.430
-Shit. No, I'm fine.
-Now!

37:46.514 --> 37:48.099
[screaming]

37:51.060 --> 37:52.103
Let's go.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.899
-[Carla] Goddammit!
-[Elisa] Calm down, Carla.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.734
[Carla] We have to follow him.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.987
You're losing a lot of blood.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.406
It doesn't matter, I swear.
Please.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.074
I need to catch him.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.620
[Carla] He must be a bit ahead.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.500
[Carla] There he his!

38:15.751 --> 38:17.128
[Carla] That's his truck!

38:17.211 --> 38:18.671
Go.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.631
-Give me one.
-Right there.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.180
Catch up, Elisa.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.603
Closer, speed up!

38:38.774 --> 38:40.317
Now! Now!

38:40.401 --> 38:41.986
Speed up!

39:18.230 --> 39:19.857
[Manuel groans]

39:30.576 --> 39:32.161
[Manuel] Fucking broads.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.375
You're all the same shit.

39:39.585 --> 39:40.836
You're weak.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.833
[uplifting song plays]

40:39.436 --> 40:40.980
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.527
The girls told me
they liked your apartment.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.779
Yes, it's very pretty.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.740
[all singing]
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

41:07.548 --> 41:08.966
What are you doing here?

41:11.802 --> 41:13.387
I'm worried about you, Elisa.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.432
I heard you're being
investigated.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.978
The game consisted
of a series of tests.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.105
<i>[Petersen continues] The tests</i>
<i>are made for someone to pass</i>
<i>them,</i>

41:23.189 --> 41:24.398
<i>for someone to win.</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:26.859
<i>What's the goal?</i>

41:26.942 --> 41:28.736
[Elisa]
<i>They're looking for wolves.</i>

41:28.819 --> 41:31.280
<i>Pack leaders, alphas.</i>

41:31.363 --> 41:33.824
[Petersen]
<i>Above the Alphas are the Apexes.</i>

41:33.908 --> 41:36.785
<i>The ones that have</i>
<i>no natural rivals.</i>

41:36.869 --> 41:39.997
<i>They're hibernating.</i>
<i>Getting stronger.</i>

41:40.080 --> 41:42.249
<i>While everyone thinks</i>

41:42.333 --> 41:43.959
<i>that the nightmare is over.</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:56.305
[Petersen]<i> They're strong,</i>
<i>trained, and in communication.</i>

41:57.640 --> 42:00.518
<i>What'll they do now</i>
<i>that the game is over?</i>

42:02.353 --> 42:03.479
An army.

42:48.315 --> 42:50.109
-Please.
-Thank you very much.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.909
These men are going to help us.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.125
You'll be back home
in no time, Augusto.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.212
We have big plans for you.

TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
