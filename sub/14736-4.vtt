I'm gonna take that choker

03:16.487 --> 03:18.579
See, we love swapping crafts
with each other,

03:18.579 --> 03:20.661
but it's incredibly
inconvenient.

03:20.661 --> 03:22.493
So I'm gonna create a website

03:22.493 --> 03:24.825
where we can swap crafts
with each other 24/7.

the right number.

would be cheating.

about computers?

07:20.861 --> 07:22.983
I know how to turn them on,
I know how to turn them off,

07:22.983 --> 07:24.945
and I know they are very
expensive to replace

07:24.945 --> 07:29.700
if you drop them
in the fish tank
at the dentist's office.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.742
You know what,
let's start with the basics.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.073
One of the fundamentals
of programing

07:33.073 --> 07:34.875
is the conditional
command string.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.127
If this, then that,
unless this.
Make sense?

07:38.078 --> 07:40.000
Not really.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.132
Well, it's easier
than it sounds.

07:42.132 --> 07:46.967
(STAMMERS) Oh. No,
this isn't really my thing.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.051

maybe you could do it for me.

07:51.051 --> 07:53.053
You don't even wanna try?

07:53.053 --> 07:55.055

at this.

07:55.055 --> 07:57.688

07:58.729 --> 07:59.980

07:59.980 --> 08:03.984
Will you
beep-bop-beep-bop-boop

08:03.984 --> 08:06.156

Since everyone else

I'm left with
no other option but to say

thanks for coming to
help me set up for
my grandma's party, you guys.

No problem, Barry.

Does he have any idea
how much we charge
for our services?

He will when
he gets our bill.

bringing the food out.

straightening up?

we'll stand as straight
as he wants.

has to be good.

I'm down here!

I can't see you!

how you can tell if
a girl likes you.

I mean, I know matters

See, when a girl likes you,
she'll give you
certain signs.

She'd probably be friendly
and chatty and...

is when she starts bringing
you presents and treats...

Oh, my gosh, you guys
have been working so hard,

there's a boat back here.

Wow, those plants
look so tiny next to
this giant boat.

Aw, man, Shelby's going to
see this and she'll know
I cheated on the contest.

I'm just gonna call
the station and tell them
to take the boat back.

Hi. Yeah,
I'm the girl
who won the boat.

13:45.445 --> 13:47.117

Hey, a captain's hat!

I'm in charge.

going anywhere.

at your jokes?

who likes a girl,

14:46.266 --> 14:48.178

how to know if the girl
likes him back.

they like brownies

they like blondies and...

you dress like a hobo.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.755
Hey! Some ne'er-do-well
absconded with my boat!

21:36.626 --> 21:38.628
No one stole the boat.

21:38.628 --> 21:39.679
How dare you!

21:39.679 --> 21:41.841
Naldo, get a hold
of yourself!

21:41.841 --> 21:44.594
That boat was bad
for both of us

21:44.594 --> 21:48.728
so I put it on Shelby's
swap site and I traded it for
something a little more you.

21:49.929 --> 21:51.981
It's a hat
with boats in it.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.695
Maybe I did go
a little crazy.

21:55.695 --> 21:58.608
It's just I've never gotten
to be a captain before.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.610
I guess that hat really
went to my head.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.033
Thanks, Cyd.

22:04.033 --> 22:07.787
Now, Grandma, I know
I ruined your birthday
last year,

22:07.787 --> 22:10.750
but I think I more than
made up for it this year.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.766
Chet's back to full-size!

22:26.766 --> 22:28.808
And I smell like the movies!

22:35.064 --> 22:37.567
CYD: You did it, Shelbs.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.068
You got your site up before
that other person could take
your idea.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.610
I'm proud of you.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.941
Thanks, Cyd.

22:41.941 --> 22:45.985
You know, I thought I wasn't
a computer person,
but it turns out...

22:45.985 --> 22:47.697
Maybe I am.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.038
All I had to do was try.

22:49.038 --> 22:52.622
Trying? Sounds hard.
I would've quit.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.754
Well, it was totally worth it.

22:54.754 --> 22:57.587
People are already
swapping all kinds of things.

22:57.587 --> 23:01.841
Bead crafts, string crafts,
somebody even swapped
a water craft.

23:01.841 --> 23:04.924
What? I'm serious,
somebody traded a boat
for a hat.

23:05.925 --> 23:07.847
Okay, fine, it was me!

23:07.847 --> 23:09.849
I used time travel to
win the contest,

23:09.849 --> 23:11.060
but the prize was a boat
and I knew you'd be

23:11.060 --> 23:12.852
disappointed in me
if you saw it

23:12.852 --> 23:14.684
so I hid it from you and then
Naldo went crazy

23:14.684 --> 23:15.775
and I guess my point is

23:15.775 --> 23:16.776
none of this would
have happened if a boat

23:16.776 --> 23:17.897
could fit in a box!

23:20.780 --> 23:23.983
Cyd? I don't think you should
get up at 6:00 a.m. anymore.

23:25.785 --> 23:26.946
Good call.

23:26.946 --> 23:29.829
If I don't get
a full 15 hours,
I start making bad choices.
