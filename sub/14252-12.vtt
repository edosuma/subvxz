WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:10.305
Chapter 18: ''Bride of Chaotica.''

00:10.377 --> 00:13.107
The evil Dr. Chaotica
kidnaps Constance Goodheart

00:13.179 --> 00:14.612
and plans to sacrifice her

00:14.681 --> 00:16.945
to Arachnia,
Queen of the Spider People.

00:20.653 --> 00:24.555
Captain Proton travels
millions of miles to Planet X,

00:24.624 --> 00:27.149
where he will invade
the Fortress of Doom.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.889
Chaotica fires
his fiendish death ray--

00:29.963 --> 00:31.624
certain death for Proton,

00:31.698 --> 00:34.326
as his rocket ship
bursts into flames.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.368
We didn't burst into flames
in the last chapter.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.131
Why are these recaps
always so inaccurate?

00:38.238 --> 00:40.206
Well, they brought people
back to the theaters.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.001
Cliffhangers.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.475
The lost art of hyperbole.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.011
You ready?

00:46.079 --> 00:47.512
Aye, Captain.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.514
Let's get this show on the road.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.015
Computer...

00:51.084 --> 00:52.176
begin Chapter 18.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.018
We're receiving a transmission.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.647
lt's Chaotica.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.852
lmagizing.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.599
Captain Proton...

01:09.002 --> 01:10.492
surrender!

01:10.603 --> 01:11.831
Not a chance.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.337
Release Miss Goodheart

01:13.406 --> 01:14.896
and we'll be on our way.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.236
l'm afraid your ''secretary''

01:17.310 --> 01:20.336
has already been promised
to Queen Arachnia

01:20.413 --> 01:22.938
as a supreme sacrifice.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.815
You'll never
get away with this.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.148
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

01:28.221 --> 01:29.950
But l shall!

01:30.023 --> 01:32.890
You escaped
from my death ray once,

01:32.959 --> 01:35.826
but you won't survive this!

01:36.896 --> 01:38.864
He's charging the weapon.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.799
Brace for impact.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.436
Direct hit!

01:45.505 --> 01:47.132
We lost both engines!

01:47.240 --> 01:49.367
Steering jets are
on the fritz!

01:57.083 --> 01:59.210
We're going down!

02:01.521 --> 02:03.887
The landing gear
is jammed!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.424
Hang on!

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.668 --> 02:17.465
Opening hatch.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.944
Welcome to Planet X.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.444
What's the plan?

02:27.514 --> 02:28.776
This is the part

02:28.848 --> 02:30.440
where we defeat
Chaotica's soldiers,

02:30.517 --> 02:31.779
steal their uniforms,

02:31.851 --> 02:34.285
and make our way
through the underground caverns.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.616
Hey, l thought you said

02:35.688 --> 02:37.622
there were slave girls
in this chapter.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.158
After we infiltrate
the Fortress of Doom,

02:40.226 --> 02:41.955
we'll free Chaotica's harem.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.461
Let's go.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.327
l'm right behind you.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.002
Planet X looks kind of familiar.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.298
What was the last place
we went to?

02:53.406 --> 02:55.966
The Mines of Mercury.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.667
They're identical.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.507
Sets were expensive.

02:59.579 --> 03:03.379
At least there's
no erupting volcano this time.

03:03.449 --> 03:07.886
Ah, behold the Fortress of Doom.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.455
And how are we supposed
to get up there?

03:10.523 --> 03:11.888
l told you-- the...

03:12.025 --> 03:14.391
-underground caverns.
-Underground caverns.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.757
Right.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.727
l thought you said
there was no volcano.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.096
l did.

03:23.303 --> 03:26.101
Uh...

03:26.172 --> 03:27.639
Tom.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.642
Definitely not Chaotica.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.058
Computer, end program.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.860
Unable to comply.
Holodeck controls are off-line.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.696
Paris to Bridge.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.565
Bridge, respond.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.573
We need to find
the manual overrides.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.700
There's an access port
on the rocket ship.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.175
Come on.

05:56.589 --> 05:57.920
Report.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.252
We dropped out of warp.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.519
We're at a dead stop.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.560
Cause?

06:01.627 --> 06:02.594
Unknown.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.425
Engines are operational.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.024
l'm reading gravimetric forces
around the ship.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.068
They're disrupting
our power flow.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.468
Control systems
are going off-line.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.005
l no longer have access

06:14.107 --> 06:16.837
to communications,
deflector, weapons...

06:16.909 --> 06:18.877
Scan for vessels,
tractor beams...

06:18.978 --> 06:22.106
anything that might explain
what's holding us here.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.720
Halt in the name of Chaotica!

06:30.356 --> 06:32.722
Proton!

06:32.792 --> 06:34.191
Buddy of yours?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.693
Surprised?

06:35.762 --> 06:38.094
You thought l perished
in the Den of Crocodiles.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.029
We don't have time for this.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.532
l survived...

06:41.634 --> 06:43.727
clinging to the thought
that l would

06:43.836 --> 06:44.803
one day...

06:55.581 --> 06:56.548
Oh! Oh.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.375
l believe l have an explanation.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.978
Sensors show that we've
entered a layer of subspace.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.579
lt's disrupting our warp field.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.454
Do we have impulse?

07:06.526 --> 07:07.686
Yes.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.057
Engage at full.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.303
No change in our position.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.668
Route all available power
to the engines.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.833
We're not moving.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.636
The impulse reactor
is running hot.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.177
We're heading for an overload.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.507
Give it all she's got.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.047
Full thrusters.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.815
No effect.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.351
Reactor's at critical.

07:33.419 --> 07:34.886
Abort.

07:37.857 --> 07:41.258
lncrease power to the structural
integrity field.

07:41.327 --> 07:42.885
We may be here awhile.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.527
lt's no use.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.261
l can't disengage the program.

07:49.368 --> 07:52.098
Well, you better think
of something fast, Proton.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.277
A second distortion
just appeared.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.437
Whatever they are,
they're getting bigger.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.281
Hold on.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.283
l've got access
to the transporter.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.148
l'm going to try
a site-to-site.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.244
There's a third one.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.003
l've run
a transpectral analysis.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.505
The barrier between normal space
and subspace is unstable

08:27.573 --> 08:28.870
throughout this region.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.136
Basically, we've run aground
on a subspace sandbar.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.871
l've tried realigning
the warp field,

08:32.945 --> 08:34.309
reversing hull polarity...

08:34.380 --> 08:36.075
Maybe we should just
get out and push.

08:36.148 --> 08:37.409
The gravimetric forces

08:37.549 --> 08:39.211
are disrupting
our control systems.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.717
As long as we're trapped here,

08:40.785 --> 08:42.845
we won't have access
to the computer core,

08:42.922 --> 08:45.413
tactical, holodecks,
and all but six replicators.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.254
What about those distortions
on the holodeck?

08:47.326 --> 08:48.258
What's the connection?

08:48.327 --> 08:49.726
They appear to be random
energy fluctuations.

08:49.795 --> 08:50.853
l don't believe
they pose a threat.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.363
Let's keep an eye on them,
anyway.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.093
And evacuate that deck
just to be safe.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.668
A few years back,

08:58.738 --> 09:01.707
when l was a science
officer on the Al-Batani,

09:01.807 --> 09:04.401
we tried to navigate
a dense protonebula.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.536
lt stopped us
dead in our tracks.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.638
For three days, we attempted
to force our way out

09:09.715 --> 09:12.343
until we realized
we were trying too hard.

09:12.418 --> 09:13.350
Captain?

09:13.419 --> 09:14.647
Every time we engaged
the engines,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.278
we were increasing
the resistance

09:16.355 --> 09:17.947
of the nebula's particle field.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.685
We may be facing
a similar situation.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.817
Our own warp field

09:20.927 --> 09:22.827
may be increasing
the gravimetric forces.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.328
lf we power down the core
and use minimal thrusters,

09:25.398 --> 09:26.831
we might be able
to break free.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.060
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.635
Your plan could work.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.204
Now that we
have your blessing...

09:33.306 --> 09:35.274
Let's give it a try.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.038
Halt, in the name of Chaotica!

10:07.106 --> 10:09.506
We intend no harm.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.042
Seize them!

10:13.813 --> 10:15.872
Lower the drawbridge.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.610
We are bringing prisoners.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.582
Yes, yes, yes, Lonzak.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.287
What do you want?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.694
Your Majesty.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.062
Where's Proton?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.795
He, uh... escaped.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.427
Fool!

10:39.538 --> 10:42.735
You will pay
for your incompetence!

10:42.808 --> 10:44.435
Seize him!

10:44.510 --> 10:45.875
Surrender.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.503
But, Majesty...

10:47.580 --> 10:49.445
l have brought prisoners.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.211
More Earthlings?

10:52.284 --> 10:53.717
No!

10:53.786 --> 10:56.687
They claim
they're from another dimension.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.450
The fifth dimension.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.824
Bring them to me.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.661
ldentify yourself.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.067
You insult me!

11:17.143 --> 11:21.409
l am Chaotica,
Ruler of the Cosmos!

11:21.480 --> 11:24.381
Kneel before his Majesty!

11:25.918 --> 11:27.852
l said kneel!

11:29.822 --> 11:31.255
You...

11:31.323 --> 11:34.258
have invaded my planet.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.089
Why?

11:36.162 --> 11:39.359
To contact
other photonic life-forms...

11:39.432 --> 11:41.093
to learn from them.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.259
Are you alone

11:43.369 --> 11:47.806
or are you the vanguard
of an invading army?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.670
We are explorers.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.803
l am growing weary
of this charade.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.713
Your armies will be no match
for my space force.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.081
We'll crush you like insects!

12:00.152 --> 12:01.619
They are hostile.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.178
This contact should
be terminated.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.019
lndeed.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.117
Lonzak, execute them!

12:13.165 --> 12:14.598
Coward.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.363
He'll learn there's
no escape from Chaotica.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.903
Gather my space force.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.529
Power the death ray!

12:20.639 --> 12:22.607
At once, Majesty.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.246
Take Miss Goodheart to Arachnia.

12:28.314 --> 12:32.580
lnvite the queen
to join me in battle.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.585
Together,

12:34.653 --> 12:39.090
we will rain destruction
on the fifth dimension!

12:45.831 --> 12:48.061
Captain's Log, supplemental.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.260
We've been spinning our wheels

12:50.369 --> 12:53.338
for three days now,
and still no progress

12:53.439 --> 12:56.033
in breaking free
of the subspace layer.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.577
Look on the bright side--

12:58.644 --> 12:59.906
there's only three meals a day.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.245
Coffee. Black.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.578
Uh, sorry, Captain.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.380
We lost two more
replicators this morning.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.784
Listen to me very carefully,

13:08.854 --> 13:10.822
because l'm only going
to say this once.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.188
Coffee. Black.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.124
Yes, ma'am.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.090
Coffee. Black.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.794
While l've got your
attention, there are...

13:22.902 --> 13:23.994
Coffee first.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.735
Now, what's the problem?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.508
lt's a...
it's a delicate matter.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.141
l don't have time to play
20 questions, Neelix.

13:38.217 --> 13:43.177
Replicators aren't the only
systems of convenience off-line.

13:43.255 --> 13:47.453
We've only got
four functioning lavatories

13:47.526 --> 13:49.357
for a ship of 150 people.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.861
l see.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.627
Needless to say,
lines are beginning to form.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.429
lf we don't get unstuck soon,

13:56.535 --> 13:58.765
we may have a serious
problem on our hands...

13:58.871 --> 14:02.204
uh... especially
with the Bolians.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.710
All but three sonic
showers are off-line, too.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.245
ln another couple of days...

14:07.313 --> 14:08.610
l get the idea.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.148
Captain to the Bridge.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.877
On my way.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.784
l'm going to leave these
problems in your capable hands.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.151
Yes, ma'am.
Now, l was thinking,

14:16.222 --> 14:17.382
if we drew up a schedule...

14:17.456 --> 14:19.219
Whatever it takes.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.833
Status.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.165
The warp core
has been powered down.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.828
Thrusters at standby.

14:32.938 --> 14:36.339
Okay. Let's give it a try.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.706
Take us out, Tom, nice and slow.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.947
We're moving.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.353
Two meters per second.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.583
Three meters.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.216
Steady.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.625
Nine meters.

14:56.695 --> 14:57.957
Ten...

14:58.030 --> 14:59.964
lncrease power
to the thrusters by 50 percent.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.830
We're approaching
the subspace boundary.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.936
25 meters per second.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.471
Wait a minute.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.008
We're slowing down.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.011
19 meters per second... 18...

15:14.079 --> 15:15.774
Captain,
l'm reading power surges.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.780
Source?

15:16.849 --> 15:19.249
Unknown, but they look
like weapons signatures.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.286
l'm not reading
any other ships in the area.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.656
We've stopped.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.022
l've localized
the weapons fire.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.721
lt's emanating
from within the ship--

15:30.796 --> 15:32.559
Deck 6, Holodeck 2.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.098
Who's still on that deck?

15:34.166 --> 15:36.600
No one. No life signs.

15:36.702 --> 15:37.896
There's a program running.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.128
lt's Captain Proton.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.796
Proton?

15:40.906 --> 15:42.134
Can you shut it down?

15:42.207 --> 15:43.299
Negative.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.502
Control system
still malfunctioning.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.341
Tuvok, get down there
and find out what's happening.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.540
Well, join him.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.775
Yes, ma'am.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.220
lt appears
that a battle took place.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.995
Believe me, it wasn't
like this when l left.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.263
l must have missed
a few chapters.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.101
Holodeck programs don't
normally run by themselves.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.607
No kidding.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.877
She's dead.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.713
Who is she?

16:26.785 --> 16:28.343
Constance Goodheart.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.887
My secretary.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.319
This doesn't make sense.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.823
She isn't supposed to die.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.552
She's one of the good guys.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.651
l'm sure you two
were very close,

16:36.729 --> 16:38.890
but she is a holodeck character.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.057
A character
from 1930s Hollywood.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.828
The good guys
never get killed.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.335
Something's wrong here.

16:45.404 --> 16:49.568
lnvaders from the
fifth... dimension.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.336
Satan's robot.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.672
Naturally.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.942
Queen Arachnia...
is on her way.

16:56.048 --> 16:59.313
lnvaders from the...
fifth dimension.

16:59.385 --> 17:00.249
Give me a hand.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.546
lf we can repair his vocalizer,

17:01.587 --> 17:03.578
he might be able to tell us
what's been going on.

17:03.655 --> 17:06.249
Destroy Proton.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.589
lt looks like...
he burned out a resistor.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.094
A what?

17:11.163 --> 17:14.155
That's a few centuries
before deutronic circuitry.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.224
l see. How do you propose
we repair him?

17:17.301 --> 17:20.931
Well, first of all,
we've got to remove

17:21.040 --> 17:22.507
this damaged tube.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.010
No problem.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.172
Just a few crossed wires.

17:29.248 --> 17:32.342
Your knowledge of this
technology is most impressive.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.318
Oh... thanks.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.351
There. Got it.

17:37.423 --> 17:43.328
lntruders... lntruders...
lntrude...

17:43.395 --> 17:46.330
lntruder alert!
lntruder alert!

17:46.398 --> 17:47.763
Tell us what happened.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.767
lnvaders
from the fifth dimension!

17:49.868 --> 17:50.994
lnvaders from
the fifth dimension!

17:51.103 --> 17:52.092
Hey, calm down!

17:52.204 --> 17:53.728
How did these invaders get here?

17:53.839 --> 17:55.306
A portal.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.035
The fifth dimension...

17:57.109 --> 17:59.873
There's not supposed to be
alien invaders in this story.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.539
That's in ''Captain Proton
Versus the Cosmic Creature.''

18:02.648 --> 18:05.583
lnvaders
from the fifth dimension!

18:06.618 --> 18:09.314
Those subspace distortions.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.084
Take us to this... portal.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.642
There.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.313
Photonic charges--

18:40.385 --> 18:42.649
the same signatures
as the weapons fire we detected.

18:42.721 --> 18:43.881
The fifth dimension!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.322
We must report this
to the Captain.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.621
Wait. l want to check
my rocket ship first.

18:48.694 --> 18:49.786
Excuse me?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.693
lt's got sensors.
Sort of.

18:51.763 --> 18:55.460
Maybe they can tell us something
Voyager's sensors can't.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.604
l've established a visual link
with the holodeck.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.480
The attack appears to be
originating from subspace.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.608
Can you tell
where it's coming from?

19:12.684 --> 19:14.276
No.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.487
What was that?

19:21.560 --> 19:22.925
Chaotica's death ray.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.257
Excuse me?

19:24.329 --> 19:27.958
Let's see if we can get a look
inside his fortress,

19:28.033 --> 19:29.898
find out what he's up to.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.598
Full power to the death ray!

19:36.241 --> 19:40.507
Arachnia,
Queen of the Spider People...

19:40.579 --> 19:44.174
you have not responded
to my summons. Don't...

19:45.884 --> 19:47.511
l don't get it.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.817
Chaotica was supposed to be
fighting Earth in this chapter.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.584
Apparently,
he's found a new enemy.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.057
The fifth dimension.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.151
lt seems
your infantile scenario

19:56.228 --> 19:57.889
now poses a security risk.

19:57.963 --> 20:01.558
lt was just supposed to be
a little harmless entertainment.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.694
Entertainment-- another
frivolous human endeavor.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.772
These are your sensor readings?

20:07.839 --> 20:09.466
Telegram.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.543
lt's a message
to Captain Proton

20:11.643 --> 20:13.406
from the President of Earth.

20:13.478 --> 20:15.446
''lntercepted communications

20:15.514 --> 20:19.917
''between Dr. Chaotica
and Arachnia. Stop.

20:19.985 --> 20:24.718
''Chaotica at war with aliens
from fifth dimension. Stop.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.588
Must strike now
to disable death ray.''

20:27.659 --> 20:28.887
Stop.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.792
Please summarize the message.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.129
Well, it looks like...
Chaotica has captured

20:35.200 --> 20:37.964
a couple of aliens
from the fifth dimension.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.104
An alternate universe.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.605
Could be. Maybe they wandered
into the holodeck

20:42.674 --> 20:44.335
through one
of those distortions.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.001
To participate in a game?

20:46.144 --> 20:48.112
lntruder!

20:51.450 --> 20:55.011
l assume there's no locking
mechanism on the hatch.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.611
lt was a simpler time.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.753
ls he part of the program?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.885
l don't recognize him.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.155
lnvaders!
lnv...

21:10.269 --> 21:11.201
Quiet!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.202
lnvaders.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.104
Look, there's been
a misunderstanding.

21:15.173 --> 21:19.405
l'm Ensign Paris
from the Starship Voyager.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.809
This is Lieutenant Tuvok.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.278
You have killed 53 of my people.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.645
We haven't killed anyone...

21:24.716 --> 21:25.808
Ensign.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.081
Everything you see here
is a simulation.

21:29.154 --> 21:30.280
None of it's real.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.879
Simulation?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.720
A photonically-based projection.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.521
All life is photonic.

21:35.594 --> 21:36.891
We are not.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.896
We are biochemical life-forms.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.831
l'm not familiar
with biochemical.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.663
We are carbon-based.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.236
We live aboard a starship.

21:45.337 --> 21:48.431
l believe we have become trapped
in a region of space

21:48.540 --> 21:49.905
that intersects your own.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.136
We've detected no starship...

21:52.210 --> 21:53.575
only this planet.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.545
This planet isn't real.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.913
As l told you,
it's part of a simulation.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.544
Maybe we can help you
adjust your sensors.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.089
You don't register
as a life-form.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.651
You are the illusion.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.195
We're as real as you are.
Listen...

22:11.263 --> 22:13.356
Citizen of the fifth dimension,

22:13.432 --> 22:15.525
you will be destroyed.

22:19.805 --> 22:23.104
Wait!
Wait!

22:23.175 --> 22:27.168
Damage. Damage.
Require maintenance. Help.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.235
Help.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.249
Help.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.750
Let me get this straight.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.415
Transdimensional aliens

22:39.491 --> 22:42.119
have mistaken
your Captain Proton simulation

22:42.194 --> 22:43.456
for reality.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.790
Yes, ma'am.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.058
And now an armed conflict
has broken out

22:47.132 --> 22:50.124
between these aliens
and Chaotica's holographic army.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.191
Yes, ma'am.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.567
His Army of Evil.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.003
And will someone please explain

22:55.073 --> 22:57.007
why we haven't simply
shut down the holodeck?

22:57.142 --> 22:59.110
We've tried. The controls
are still off-line.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.109
We're going to have

23:00.212 --> 23:01.679
to get through
to these aliens somehow

23:01.713 --> 23:03.442
and explain that they're
fighting shadows.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.278
We've tried,
but they don't believe us.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.375
They think that we're not real.

23:07.452 --> 23:10.250
They can't detect Voyager,

23:10.322 --> 23:13.120
so every time they scan us,
we seem as artificial to them

23:13.191 --> 23:16.058
as holographic characters
do to us.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.529
That explains why they
haven't answered our hails.

23:19.598 --> 23:20.997
The Doctor is photonic.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.158
He may be able to persuade them.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.564
lt's worth a try.
Brief him.

23:23.668 --> 23:24.566
ln the meantime,

23:24.669 --> 23:26.728
l think we should let
the program play out.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.237
You're not suggesting we wait

23:28.306 --> 23:30.274
until this Chaotica
defeats the aliens?

23:30.342 --> 23:31.900
No, no. l'm suggesting

23:32.010 --> 23:35.468
that we help the aliens
to defeat Chaotica.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.242
They think that he's leading

23:37.315 --> 23:39.579
some kind of hostile
invasion force.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.846
Once that threat is gone,
it's a good bet

23:41.920 --> 23:44.514
that they will leave
and close up their portals.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.819
How do you propose
to defeat Chaotica?

23:46.892 --> 23:49.417
Well, he's been
attacking the aliens

23:49.494 --> 23:50.859
with his death ray.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.829
lt's a shame we don't have one.

23:52.898 --> 23:55.560
No. Forget about what
it's called, Tuvok.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.498
ln the world of Captain Proton,

23:57.602 --> 23:59.729
it's the most powerful
weapon that there is

23:59.838 --> 24:03.535
and because it's photonic,
it's lethal to these aliens.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.906
Now, in Chapter 18,

24:05.977 --> 24:08.639
Captain Proton
disables this weapon

24:08.713 --> 24:11.648
just before Chaotica can use it
to destroy Earth.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.308
And you think that Proton,

24:13.385 --> 24:15.853
namely you of course,
could still do that?

24:15.921 --> 24:19.015
Well, we'd have to knock out
the lightning shield first.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.250
A force field.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.724
Yeah. Now you're catching on.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.658
The destructo beam
on my rocket ship

24:23.728 --> 24:25.093
can disable the death ray,

24:25.163 --> 24:27.688
but only if someone gets inside
the Fortress of Doom

24:27.766 --> 24:29.495
and can shut down
the lightning shield.

24:29.601 --> 24:30.693
And who's supposed to do that?

24:30.802 --> 24:33.362
Arachnia,
Queen of the Spider People.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.803
Charming.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.369
Chaotica thinks so.

24:37.442 --> 24:39.307
ln the story,
he's in love with her.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.277
He's been trying
to form an alliance

24:41.346 --> 24:42.404
since Chapter Three.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.415
She's the only one
that he trusts,

24:44.483 --> 24:46.678
the only one
who can get close enough

24:46.751 --> 24:48.616
to disable the lightning shield.

24:48.687 --> 24:52.088
Somebody is going to have
to take on her character.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.022
Who'd you have in mind?

24:57.629 --> 24:58.618
Oh, no.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.892
lt's the role of a lifetime.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.432
Captain, need l remind you

25:02.501 --> 25:04.435
that we have exhausted
all other possibilities

25:04.503 --> 25:05.970
of escaping
this layer of subspace.

25:06.071 --> 25:09.131
Until we can eliminate those
distortions, we're trapped.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.404
Think of it as Starfleet's
first encounter with Planet X.

25:12.477 --> 25:13.535
Thanks.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.512
Captain, it won't be so bad.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.343
l can explain to you
what you can expect.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.677
l can tell you...

25:18.750 --> 25:20.217
All right, all right!

25:24.089 --> 25:26.023
l'm a size four.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.489
What's the emergency?

25:30.562 --> 25:31.654
l've been enlisted.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.163
l'm supposed to make contact

25:33.231 --> 25:35.324
with our photonic friends
from the fifth dimension

25:35.400 --> 25:37.197
and convince them
to call off their attack.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.532
Congratulations.
Why do you need me?

25:39.638 --> 25:41.105
lt's an undercover mission.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.197
l'll need a bit
of cosmetic surgery.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.141
These are the parameters
for my new costume.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.907
What are you going as--
the Emperor of the Universe?

25:48.980 --> 25:52.108
Well, l've been forced
to scale back my role

25:52.183 --> 25:54.344
in the interest of credibility.

25:54.419 --> 25:57.388
l'll be President of Earth.

25:57.455 --> 26:00.185
l must say,
the idea of an entire universe

26:00.258 --> 26:03.159
populated by photonic beings
is rather appealing.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.025
Well, if your mission fails,

26:05.096 --> 26:07.826
you could be taking up
permanent residence.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.993
Kim to Sick Bay.
Report to Holodeck 2, Doctor.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.069
You're all set.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.831
The new parameters will activate

26:13.939 --> 26:15.736
as soon as you
enter the holodeck.

26:15.807 --> 26:16.774
Thank you.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.438
Break a leg.

26:22.781 --> 26:23.839
So all l have to do

26:23.915 --> 26:25.974
is find the controls
of this death ray

26:26.051 --> 26:27.075
and deactivate it.

26:27.152 --> 26:29.177
Well, it's not as simple
as it sounds.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.245
Now, Chaotica might be
a 1930s villain,

26:31.323 --> 26:32.449
but he's very clever.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.856
lt'd help if you
knew some of the rules.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.018
l'm listening.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.254
All right. Well...

26:37.329 --> 26:39.524
first of all,
he's a megalomaniac,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.725
so it's a good idea
to appeal to his ego.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.028
Right.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.261
And, um, use grandiose language.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.270
He likes to be called ''Sire,''

26:47.339 --> 26:49.899
and it helps to say things like

26:50.008 --> 26:53.535
''The clever fiendishness
of your evil plan

26:53.612 --> 26:54.943
is brilliant.''

26:57.716 --> 26:58.774
Deck 4.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.010
Now, remember:

27:00.118 --> 27:02.848
lt's ray gun, not phaser,

27:02.921 --> 27:05.446
um, imagizer, not viewscreen,

27:05.523 --> 27:07.286
Earthlings, not Terrans.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.291
Got it.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.622
And another thing...

27:09.694 --> 27:12.288
these villains always have
a trick up their sleeve--

27:12.364 --> 27:13.797
trapdoors, secret weapons...

27:13.865 --> 27:14.797
lt's the holodeck.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.128
l can't be hurt by weapons.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.702
Well, that doesn't mean
that you can't be restrained

27:18.803 --> 27:20.668
or thrown into
the Dungeon of Pain.

27:20.739 --> 27:21.831
Noted.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.237
Now, as soon as you get
the death ray shut down,

27:24.309 --> 27:25.537
call me in my rocket ship

27:25.610 --> 27:27.134
and give me the signal to fire.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.670
You'll have to use
Chaotica's broadcast microphone.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.842
This is how you've been
spending your free time?

27:32.917 --> 27:34.350
Well, l've been studying

27:34.419 --> 27:36.353
how past generations
viewed the future.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.683
And...?

27:37.756 --> 27:38.882
Well, it didn't work out

27:38.957 --> 27:41.016
quite as black-and-white
as they imagined.

27:41.092 --> 27:43.560
Now, the specifications
for Arachnia's costume.

27:43.628 --> 27:44.788
One more thing...

27:44.863 --> 27:46.888
if you have trouble
with Chaotica

27:46.965 --> 27:48.990
or you can't get
to the death ray,

27:49.067 --> 27:51.365
you can always uncork
the pheromones.

27:51.469 --> 27:53.699
l beg your pardon.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.568
Uh, Chapter 16.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.130
''Spell of the Spider.''

27:57.242 --> 28:00.575
Arachnia sends Chaotica a vial
of her irresistible potion.

28:00.645 --> 28:03.637
Now, whenever he gets a whiff,
he's under her spell.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.580
l get the picture.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.118
Yeah, well, my point is,
is that these pheromones

28:08.186 --> 28:10.620
seem to throw
Chaotica for a loop.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.714
Well, it worked
in Chapter 16 anyway.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.282
Now, the vial is sitting
on a small pedestal

28:15.360 --> 28:16.486
next to the throne.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.493
l'll keep an eye out.

28:17.562 --> 28:18.494
Okay.

28:18.563 --> 28:19.689
Thanks for the briefing.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.493
l'll see you
at the Fortress of Doom.

28:21.566 --> 28:24.399
And remember-- you're the queen.

28:32.410 --> 28:35.345
Sire!

28:35.413 --> 28:38.849
Three more of our space ships
have been destroyed.

28:40.585 --> 28:44.715
Full power to the death ray.

28:50.428 --> 28:53.522
Citizens of the fifth dimension,

28:53.598 --> 28:57.898
your feeble attacks
are nothing but pinpricks to me.

28:58.069 --> 29:02.563
Surrender now
and l will be merciful.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.642
We're receiving a transmission.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.802
They are surrendering.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.435
No.

29:08.513 --> 29:10.174
lt's Queen Arachnia.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.547
She wishes to cross
the drawbridge.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.415
Ah...

29:15.487 --> 29:17.682
What are you waiting for?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.417
Show her in.

29:28.500 --> 29:33.096
l present her Royal Highness...

29:33.204 --> 29:34.899
Arachnia.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.977
Ah...

29:52.023 --> 29:53.388
At last...

29:55.093 --> 29:58.324
At last... my queen.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.212
This is an historic occasion.

30:16.281 --> 30:20.183
Kindred souls meet at last.

30:20.251 --> 30:23.618
lt's an honor to be
in your presence, Majesty.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.713
l've always admired your...

30:27.392 --> 30:29.121
clever fiendishness.

30:29.194 --> 30:37.124
Ah, your taste is exceeded
only by your beauty.

30:37.235 --> 30:40.796
This must be your death ray.

30:40.905 --> 30:44.841
That, my dear,
is the Cradle of Persuasion.

30:44.943 --> 30:46.535
lt's fully equipped--

30:46.611 --> 30:48.579
a brain probe,

30:48.646 --> 30:49.874
pain modulator.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.438
lmpressive.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.007
lt's good you have
the lightning shield

30:54.085 --> 30:55.950
to protect your equipment.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.615
Yes, as long
as it's electrified,

30:59.691 --> 31:01.386
l am invincible!

31:01.492 --> 31:03.926
But my greatest achievement

31:03.962 --> 31:05.395
is there.

31:05.463 --> 31:08.899
Behold-- the death ray.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.231
Oh, it looks like a...

31:12.337 --> 31:14.271
formidable weapon.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.933
The most powerful in the cosmos.

31:19.510 --> 31:23.310
There is so much more
l want to show you.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.486
My throne, for example.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.953
The seat...

31:31.089 --> 31:32.989
of my Empire.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.960
Ah!

31:37.028 --> 31:40.327
l see you've kept my pheromones.

31:44.068 --> 31:48.505
l didn't realize
you were the sentimental type.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.100
Your perfume inspires me.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.612
Would you mind?

31:55.680 --> 31:56.977
Please.

32:04.455 --> 32:07.390
Somehow l feel comfortable here.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.392
Join me...

32:09.460 --> 32:11.894
and you will have
your own chair--

32:11.963 --> 32:14.898
one adorned with the
most precious jewels

32:14.966 --> 32:16.399
and the softest silk.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.935
Your Majesty seems
overly concerned

32:19.003 --> 32:20.470
with romantic matters

32:20.538 --> 32:22.768
when there's a battle to be won.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.899
That is why you asked me here.

32:25.009 --> 32:27.273
Of course, my dear.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.835
Forgive me.

32:28.913 --> 32:31.848
lt's just that the air itself

32:31.916 --> 32:35.443
seems to vibrate
in your presence.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.954
We can't be slaves
to our passion...

32:38.022 --> 32:40.616
not when your Empire
is threatened.

32:40.692 --> 32:44.924
l have assembled
my fleet of... Spider Ships.

32:44.996 --> 32:46.930
However, the lightning shield

32:46.998 --> 32:49.296
prevents them from
approaching your fortress.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.358
We'll send them
directly into battle

32:51.469 --> 32:53.869
alongside my space force.

32:53.938 --> 32:57.874
My soldiers wish
to pay homage to you.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.672
Gratifying.

33:00.745 --> 33:04.408
Of course,
if l lower the shield,

33:04.482 --> 33:06.814
my fortress will be defenseless.

33:06.884 --> 33:09.785
Even an ally might
choose such a moment

33:09.854 --> 33:11.879
to seize my throne.

33:11.956 --> 33:13.685
You don't trust me.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.386
There is a way you could
convince me of your loyalty.

33:16.461 --> 33:17.723
Oh?

33:17.795 --> 33:19.387
l'll lower my lightning shield,

33:19.464 --> 33:23.059
but first, you must
become my queen!

33:23.167 --> 33:25.101
Gather my courtiers!

33:25.169 --> 33:27.103
Prepare for the ceremony!

33:27.171 --> 33:30.504
And don't forget to deactivate
the lightning shield

33:30.575 --> 33:33.601
so my subjects may witness
the blessed event.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.111
Very well.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.942
Do as she says,

33:37.015 --> 33:39.279
once her guests have arrived.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.318
Yes, Sire.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.455
And so, my dear...

33:45.523 --> 33:50.119
the day you have always
dreamed of has arrived...

33:50.194 --> 33:55.894
the day you become
Bride of Chaotica!

34:16.954 --> 34:18.251
Welcome.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.420
You are photonic.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.225
Guilty as charged.

34:27.297 --> 34:30.233
You signaled me
across the threshold.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.596
How?

34:31.702 --> 34:34.534
l believe you dropped
your calling card.

34:34.605 --> 34:36.094
l return it to you...

34:36.206 --> 34:37.969
as a sign of good faith.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.338
ldentify yourself.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.346
l am the President of Earth.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.641
Earth?

34:44.715 --> 34:47.114
A planet
some distance from here.

34:47.185 --> 34:49.619
l've come on a mission of peace.

34:49.687 --> 34:50.949
Elaborate.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.489
Your people

34:52.556 --> 34:53.751
and the people of Earth

34:53.824 --> 34:54.882
have a common enemy.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.790
Chaotica.

34:56.860 --> 34:57.953
The one and only.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.154
He threatens

34:59.230 --> 35:01.164
to invade our realm,
destroy our people.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.527
Join the club.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.058
Chaotica has designs
on Earth, too,

35:05.136 --> 35:07.764
but we've withstood
countless attacks

35:07.872 --> 35:09.601
all thanks to one man--

35:09.674 --> 35:11.437
Captain Proton.

35:11.509 --> 35:12.999
Captain Proton?

35:13.111 --> 35:16.603
Defender of the Universe,
Scourge of lntergalactic Evil

35:16.681 --> 35:18.876
and...
a competent medic to boot,

35:18.950 --> 35:20.679
but don't say l said so.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.514
Even as we speak,
he's preparing

35:22.587 --> 35:24.418
to destroy Chaotica's death ray,

35:24.489 --> 35:25.854
but he needs your help.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.618
Explain.

35:27.692 --> 35:31.651
Your weapons pose a threat
to Proton's rocket ship.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.390
You must cease firing

35:33.464 --> 35:35.398
while he mounts his attack.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.094
Once Chaotica's death ray
is destroyed,

35:38.202 --> 35:40.170
you can return to your realm,

35:40.238 --> 35:43.674
confident that you'll never
hear from him again.

35:45.009 --> 35:46.306
Captain Proton...

35:49.347 --> 35:50.871
may proceed.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.217
On behalf
of the citizens of Earth,

35:54.285 --> 35:56.219
l thank you.

36:03.561 --> 36:04.653
Space drive.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.822
-Check.
-Check.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.092
Destructo beam.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.532
-Check.
-Check.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.830
lf l could access
holodeck controls,

36:13.971 --> 36:15.996
the first thing l'd do
is delete this guy.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.540
Delete this guy.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.667
As a matter of fact,
as soon as this is all over,

36:19.744 --> 36:23.077
l think l'm going to delete
the whole program!

36:23.147 --> 36:25.547
What about
your historical study?

36:25.616 --> 36:27.345
Class dismissed.

36:27.418 --> 36:31.320
No more robots,
no more mad scientists,

36:31.389 --> 36:33.380
no more death rays.

36:33.457 --> 36:35.891
l am retiring
my rocket pack, Harry.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.394
Someone else can save
the universe from now on.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.124
The final chapter, huh?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.461
The end.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.936
lsn't anyone going to sing
''Hail to the Chief''?

36:48.072 --> 36:49.801
Mr. President, how'd it go?

36:49.874 --> 36:51.739
My performance
was unimpeachable.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.140
He agreed?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.679
Let's just say l'm considering
running for office

36:55.746 --> 36:57.213
when we get back to Earth.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.810
All right, then. Let's get
this thing in the air

37:00.918 --> 37:06.879
and hope Captain Janeway
is giving a command performance.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.851
Queen Arachnia.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.389
Don't tell me...

37:15.466 --> 37:17.491
my wedding ring.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.399
Doctor Chaotica's wedding ring.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.904
You will present it to him
at the end of the ceremony.

37:24.942 --> 37:26.068
Your Majesty,

37:26.143 --> 37:29.237
perhaps we should lower
the lightning shield

37:29.313 --> 37:31.406
in anticipation of my guests.

37:31.482 --> 37:34.144
Why this preoccupation
with the shield?

37:34.218 --> 37:35.412
Oh, forgive me.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.580
lt's just that,
as a fellow ruler of the cosmos,

37:38.656 --> 37:40.886
l often have
to do things myself.

37:40.958 --> 37:45.895
Ah. Because of the incompetence
of your inferiors, no doubt.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.624
Something like that.

37:47.698 --> 37:50.531
Oh, Arachnia,
my love, my life...

37:50.635 --> 37:53.627
how well you understand
our plight.

37:53.738 --> 37:57.401
lf it weren't beneath my
dignity, l... l would weep.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.467
How l've longed for someone
who would understand.

38:00.544 --> 38:03.445
We have a saying on Arachnia:

38:03.514 --> 38:06.142
''lt's lonely at the top.''

38:06.217 --> 38:08.811
Hmm. No longer, my dear.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.410
Majesty!

38:10.488 --> 38:12.422
Proton is preparing to attack.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.855
Wha...?

38:16.894 --> 38:18.555
Ah!

38:18.629 --> 38:20.597
Target his rocket ship.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.410
You have betrayed me.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.878
You are in league with Proton.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.972
lmpetuous harlot!

38:39.050 --> 38:42.486
Tell me how to deactivate
the lightning shield

38:42.553 --> 38:45.989
or l'll show you just
how impetuous l can be.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.218
What are you waiting
for, you great lummox?

38:48.292 --> 38:50.123
Kill her!

38:50.194 --> 38:52.822
Ha! You're no match
for Arachnia.

38:52.897 --> 38:56.298
Now, tell me
how to shut down the shield.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.631
The confinement rings!

39:08.946 --> 39:11.506
Oh, don't worry.

39:11.582 --> 39:14.050
l wouldn't kill my bride...

39:14.118 --> 39:18.748
not until after
our wedding night.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.587
Reactivate the death ray.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.320
Destroy Proton!

39:29.767 --> 39:30.961
We've been hit.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.593
Well, l guess the Captain
ran into some trouble.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.002
We're not going down
without a fight.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.597
Doc, activate
the destructo beam.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.697
The what?

39:38.809 --> 39:40.276
The big button
in the middle of that panel.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.039
-Oh.
-Destructo beam!

39:42.113 --> 39:42.909
The other panel!

39:46.016 --> 39:48.280
Destructo beam activated.

39:51.355 --> 39:52.879
We just dropped out of range.

39:53.023 --> 39:54.320
We're losing altitude.

40:00.798 --> 40:01.890
Report.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.059
The alien weapons fire
is increasing.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.636
lt's causing the distortions
to grow larger.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.137
We're being pulled deeper
into subspace.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.981
lnvaders! lnvaders!

40:20.684 --> 40:22.311
Uh... incoming.

40:24.522 --> 40:27.958
Proton's ship is damaged,
but still airborne.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.287
Not for long.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.827
Fire at will.

40:46.577 --> 40:48.044
Lonzak.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.041
Man the lightning shield.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.433
Arachnia?

41:12.736 --> 41:13.703
Lonzak.

41:15.072 --> 41:17.336
Quickly, Lonzak.
No time for dawdling.

41:25.516 --> 41:29.680
Your beauty is maddening.

41:29.753 --> 41:33.484
Entangle me in your web.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.957
Let me out of here
and l'll do all that...

41:36.060 --> 41:37.652
and more.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.964
At once, my queen.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.935
What...?

41:48.005 --> 41:49.836
Back to your station!

41:52.309 --> 41:54.140
ldiot!

41:58.082 --> 42:00.380
Deactivate the shield...

42:00.484 --> 42:01.951
now.

42:03.287 --> 42:06.381
Such passion.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.719
Such strength.

42:07.791 --> 42:11.887
Together, we could
conquer the universe.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.554
End this madness

42:13.631 --> 42:17.362
and you may yet live
to be my bride.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.527
The shield.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.741
l don't know
how to tell you this...

42:30.080 --> 42:31.809
but the wedding's off.

42:35.686 --> 42:37.244
Arachnia to Proton.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.815
Arachnia to Proton.
Do you read me?

42:41.892 --> 42:43.860
Arachnia to Proton.

42:46.697 --> 42:47.823
l'm reading you.

42:47.898 --> 42:49.559
The lightning shield is down.

42:49.633 --> 42:50.759
Acknowledged.

42:50.834 --> 42:52.563
Harry, target the death ray.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.138
Doc, fire the destructo beam
on my mark.

42:55.205 --> 42:57.332
Ready?

42:57.441 --> 42:59.238
Now!

43:12.323 --> 43:14.314
The distortions are closing.

43:14.391 --> 43:17.554
We're realigning
with normal space.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.062
Helm... full impulse.

43:27.137 --> 43:28.104
Bridge to Janeway.

43:28.172 --> 43:29.104
Go ahead.

43:29.173 --> 43:30.140
The aliens have retreated

43:30.207 --> 43:31.936
and they've closed
the distortions.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.509
We've cleared
the subspace layer.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.737
Secure all systems

43:34.812 --> 43:36.939
and organize
damage repair teams.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.174
Understood.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.341
We're preparing
to shut down the holodeck.

43:40.417 --> 43:41.975
Chakotay, give me a minute.

43:52.730 --> 43:55.563
l was about to say,
''Captain Proton to the rescue,''

43:55.633 --> 43:58.966
but l see you have
everything under control.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.536
l'm the queen, remember?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.698
Arachnia.

44:03.774 --> 44:08.711
Death, as you know it,
has no hold on me.

44:08.812 --> 44:13.511
My defeat
is but a temporary setback.

44:13.584 --> 44:17.884
l shall return
to seek my revenge.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.546
He doesn't give up, does he?

44:19.623 --> 44:21.215
They never do.

44:21.291 --> 44:25.557
Our love was not meant to be,
my queen,

44:25.629 --> 44:27.221
but be warned.

44:27.297 --> 44:30.391
You have not seen the last of...

44:33.003 --> 44:34.595
Chaotica.

44:39.209 --> 44:42.269
The end of a twisted madman.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.143
And you're going to miss him.

44:44.214 --> 44:46.614
A little.
