with the goth kids?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.004
- Oh, they're so 2005.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.465
I wouldn't be caught dead
dressing like the undead.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.675

09:52.758 --> 09:54.468
How long have you been waiting
to say that one?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.387
- Just thought of it.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.598
Since 2005.

- Hey, Emma.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.018
The principal wants
to see you.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.729
And remember, I get
the exclusive afterwards.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.653
- Oh, good, I found you.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.364
- Good for me, bad for you.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.325
- You have to stop
Mac and Diego.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.036
They are driving me crazy.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.165
- Sophie, Katie and I need
to have a private conversation.

- Sure thing.

I just--

10:39.388 --> 10:40.723
- I know what you wanted.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.725
You wanted to be
the most popular girl in school

10:42.808 --> 10:44.644
and steal Daniel from me.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.227
- What?
No.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.563
Daniel?
Ew.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.315
I mean, yes.
I mean, no.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.150
I mean, you're so smart,

10:51.233 --> 10:52.443
you figured me out,

10:52.526 --> 10:55.071
and no one can ever fool you.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.280
I should have never tried.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.617
Please don't turn me
into a caterpillar.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.660
- Now, why would I do that?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.162
- Thank you.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.332
- When I can turn you into
one of Mac's socks instead.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.335
It's so nice
when opportunity knocks.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.086

11:13.339 --> 11:14.673
You should know that.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.885

what I was doing?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.640
- So, Emma,

11:22.723 --> 11:24.266
do you like
to play games?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.935
- Like board games?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.853
- I love playing games
with my students,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.648
because it gives me a chance
to really connect with them.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.608
My favorite
is "Rhyme with Friends."

11:32.692 --> 11:35.653
I'm sure you've heard of it.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.862
- I don't think so.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.406
- Well, see,
it's really very simple.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.782
You see, I say a sentence,

11:39.865 --> 11:42.660
and then you say one
that rhymes with mine.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.162
- How does that help you
connect with--

19:08.522 --> 19:11.483
to give her the weekly
lice and chicken pox report.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.317
But I'll come back later.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.069
- No, no.
Wait. Wait!

19:29.209 --> 19:30.752
- I've got to bring the book
to Lily.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.297
So far,
she's the only one I can trust.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.050
The only witch I can trust.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.594
- Okay,
where'd you leave the <i> Hex?</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:41.013
- Home in a safe place.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.476
- [gasps]

19:48.937 --> 19:51.106
So then she said
lady with stethoscope,

19:51.189 --> 19:52.649
she bring the thing with words,

19:52.733 --> 19:54.276
give her the knowledge
of how it'll work.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.986
Giraffes hate horseshoes.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.739
- Translate, please.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.867
- The nurse is helping Emma

20:01.950 --> 20:04.578
figure out
how to use the spell book?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.706
- You make birthday cakes
out of pickles and toenails.

20:07.789 --> 20:08.957
- I knew it.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
I knew she was trouble.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.420
- I eat bark off the fishes.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.630
- What's wrong with her?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.340
- I think she was
in the locker too long.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.425
Not enough oxygen.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.968
Deep breaths.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.600
- [gasps]
Look, there's the nurse.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.352
We have to neutralize her.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.853
- Ooh! Make it a good one.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.856
- Sure to get messing
with someone so spunky

20:32.940 --> 20:34.399
when I turn Nurse Lily
into a monkey.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.904
[laughter]

20:48.914 --> 20:49.665
- [gasps]

20:49.748 --> 20:51.708
What?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.336
[sighs]

20:55.754 --> 20:59.341
[laughter]

21:00.842 --> 21:02.594
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:04.304 --> 21:05.138
- What happened?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.890
You said you want to...
see me?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.184
- I have, um,

21:09.267 --> 21:11.353
a pro--ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:11.436 --> 21:13.313
Problem--a big one.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.606
- Nah, nah, just--

21:14.690 --> 21:16.191
just a quick trip to the salon,

21:16.274 --> 21:18.568
and they'll wax that off
in a jiffy.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.861
And as for your nose and ears,

21:19.945 --> 21:22.114
you're in luck.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.033
Miami has the top-notch
plastic surgeons.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.035
- I am no mood for your--

21:27.119 --> 21:27.619
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:27.703 --> 21:30.122
Attitude.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.206
We need the <i> Hexoren.</i>

21:31.289 --> 21:32.666
Reversing another witch's spell

21:32.749 --> 21:34.209
is very di--ee, ah, ah, ah!

21:34.292 --> 21:35.377
Difficult.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.211
- I have it at home.
I can go get it.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.046
- But first I have to tell you

21:38.130 --> 21:39.381
something really, really
important.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.091
- What?
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:41.174 --> 21:42.342
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:42.426 --> 21:43.552
- Andi, help!
What is she trying to say?

21:43.635 --> 21:46.680
- How would I know?
I don't speak monkey!

21:46.763 --> 21:48.098
I only speak Chihuahua

21:48.181 --> 21:50.058
and a little bulldog.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.268
- Lily, who did this?

21:51.351 --> 21:52.728
Was it Maddie?

21:52.811 --> 21:53.979
[electricity crackles]

21:54.771 --> 21:55.814
