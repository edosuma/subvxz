00:00.407 --> 00:02.386
Previously on "For the People"...

00:03.360 --> 00:04.427
Damn!

00:04.461 --> 00:06.606
I can cancel my date tonight
and work on this with you.

00:06.630 --> 00:08.106
I don't want you to cancel your date.

00:08.131 --> 00:10.333
I'll be thinking about you
the whole time.

00:10.367 --> 00:12.335
It's about opposing counsel.
She's my girlfriend.

00:12.369 --> 00:13.869
The AUSA handling the case

00:13.904 --> 00:16.204
filed the additional claims
for the sole purpose

00:16.239 --> 00:17.974
of pressuring Ms. Locarno into a deal.

00:18.008 --> 00:19.976
- I'm on probation.
- I did what I had to do.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.021
And now I'm gonna do
what I have to do. I'm leaving.

00:22.045 --> 00:23.323
- Good morning.
- Not for you, apparently.

00:23.347 --> 00:24.524
We were just talking about losers.

00:24.548 --> 00:26.693
My case was thrown out.
Can we really call that a loss?

00:26.717 --> 00:27.883
We can call it a big loss.

00:27.918 --> 00:30.319
We are not going to break up
over an insidertrading case.

00:30.354 --> 00:31.531
No, we're gonna break up because

00:31.555 --> 00:33.889
I don't want to be second chair
to you the rest of my life.

00:33.924 --> 00:35.958
And if I stay,
we both know that I would be.

01:02.252 --> 01:03.652
Hey.

01:06.123 --> 01:07.156
There he is.

01:07.190 --> 01:08.157
Hey, Mom!

01:08.191 --> 01:09.158
You're all moved in.

01:09.192 --> 01:12.061
Yep, feels like home.

01:12.095 --> 01:13.996
- This is the best thing for you.
- Don't.

01:14.031 --> 01:15.231
- What?
- Bring Allison up.

01:15.265 --> 01:18.203
I wasn't. I'm just proud
that you have your own place.

01:18.237 --> 01:19.163
Thanks, Mom.

01:19.197 --> 01:20.903
- Without Allison.
- Mom...

01:20.937 --> 01:22.204
Can you believe what's going on

01:22.239 --> 01:23.506
- over here in Lincoln?
- What?

01:23.540 --> 01:26.175
You know the aerospace plant
that went in a few years back?

01:26.209 --> 01:29.045
KapplerHays, yeah?
They've been allowing some chemical

01:29.079 --> 01:30.279
to run off their property,

01:30.313 --> 01:33.949
and, apparently, it's in
the soil, the drinking water.

01:33.984 --> 01:35.751
People are getting really sick.

01:35.786 --> 01:37.520
Is that Carver?

01:37.554 --> 01:39.555
Your elementary school.

01:39.589 --> 01:41.023
Remember Jenny Mars?

01:41.058 --> 01:42.138
Of course I remember Jenny.

01:43.260 --> 01:47.263
That's her son, Theo, in the picture.

01:47.297 --> 01:49.532
He's on life support.

01:49.566 --> 01:50.766
You're a lawyer.

01:50.801 --> 01:52.401
Can you do something about all this?

01:52.436 --> 01:53.869
I'm not that kind of lawyer, Mom.

01:53.904 --> 01:55.538
Well, what kind of lawyer are you?

02:10.654 --> 02:11.754
Hey.

02:11.788 --> 02:13.583
- You biked here?
- Yeah. You?

02:14.724 --> 02:16.258
I thought I'd beat her here.

02:16.293 --> 02:17.670
I saw her at home in the morning once.

02:17.694 --> 02:19.295
That was the closest I've come.

02:19.329 --> 02:22.042
Chloe Daniels, assault on
a postal worker...

02:22.076 --> 02:23.099
I'll take it.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.444
Have you ever done a murder case?

02:24.468 --> 02:25.468
YYou said "assault."

02:25.502 --> 02:27.570
He might die. Allison? Jay?

02:27.604 --> 02:30.239
Not a lot of murder at the ACLU.
Lot of talking, mostly.

02:30.273 --> 02:33.109
AAt County PD, I had guys who
probably had murdered, so...

02:33.143 --> 02:35.478
This one's mine then. Assist and learn.

02:35.512 --> 02:38.247
What exactly did Chloe Daniels do?

02:38.281 --> 02:42.451
I was getting my mail.
Just like a normal day.

02:42.486 --> 02:44.153
He was already in the mail room.

02:44.187 --> 02:45.421
Were you alone?

02:45.455 --> 02:47.423
It wasn't Stanley, our normal mail guy.

02:47.457 --> 02:50.459
This guys was... weird.

02:50.494 --> 02:52.261
He was, um...

02:52.295 --> 02:54.163
looking at me...

02:54.197 --> 02:56.571
Yeah, it was just the two of us.

02:56.598 --> 02:59.967
Before I could even open the mailbox,

03:00.001 --> 03:01.302
he came at me.

03:04.139 --> 03:08.575
So II grabbed a letter opener
off the counter.

03:08.610 --> 03:10.344
Really, the next thing I can remember

03:10.378 --> 03:13.614
is him bleeding from his neck.

03:13.648 --> 03:16.250
And then I called the police.

03:16.284 --> 03:19.153
I've never hurt anyone
in my life, Ms. Carlan.

03:19.187 --> 03:21.488
I was just trying to defend myself.

03:21.523 --> 03:23.590
And I'm here to defend you, Chloe.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.694
A plea of not guilty is entered

03:26.728 --> 03:27.905
as to all counts of the indictment.

03:27.929 --> 03:30.664
Our next order of business
is assigning a judge for trial.

03:30.699 --> 03:31.799
Ms. Krissman?

03:34.202 --> 03:36.470
The Honorable Judge Gerald McKinnon.

03:38.139 --> 03:40.174
The Honorable Judge Eva Corcoran.

03:42.077 --> 03:44.345
The Honorable Judge Nicholas Byrne.

03:44.379 --> 03:46.113
My client has no criminal record,

03:46.147 --> 03:49.116
she isn't a flight risk,
and has roots in the community.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.118
We respectfully ask for bond

03:51.152 --> 03:53.153
in an amount commensurate
with her resources.

03:53.188 --> 03:54.822
Under the condition that Ms. Daniels

03:54.856 --> 03:57.391
confine herself to her home
except for the purposes of work,

03:57.425 --> 03:59.226
bail is set for $20,000.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.061
Now, let's pick a trial judge.

04:11.239 --> 04:13.640
MMaybe just pull a card, Ms. Krissman?

04:14.943 --> 04:16.310
How bad is it?

04:18.113 --> 04:19.190
We may have to put her down.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.315
That's sad.

04:21.349 --> 04:24.485
I remember the first time on the
Wheel, I got Judge Wallace Andrews.

04:24.519 --> 04:25.753
- Yuck.
- Deeply unpleasant.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.689
But then he ruled for me on an
impossible suppression motion.

04:28.723 --> 04:31.592
Still remember that.
Never doubt the Wheel.

04:31.626 --> 04:33.160
First of all, who even thinks about

04:33.194 --> 04:35.996
running a pipeline
full of poison next to a school?

04:36.031 --> 04:37.698
TThe school is already right there.

04:37.732 --> 04:40.000
It's not... an invisible school.

04:40.035 --> 04:41.545
I found it every morning for six years.

04:41.569 --> 04:42.613
It's hard to ask you to leave

04:42.637 --> 04:44.838
when you're using the words
"poison" and "school."

04:44.873 --> 04:47.107
- I'm angry.
- You should be.

04:47.142 --> 04:48.686
And they're probably
gonna get away with this.

04:48.710 --> 04:51.178
If only you knew someone
in the federal justice system

04:51.212 --> 04:52.646
who could do something about it.

04:53.982 --> 04:55.092
KapplerHays has already committed

04:55.116 --> 04:57.117
so many EPA violations here...

04:57.152 --> 04:59.787
Clean Water Act,
Toxic Substances Control Act...

04:59.821 --> 05:02.299
Doesn't Nebraska have an attorney
general and courts and stuff?

05:02.323 --> 05:03.257
I'm not up on Nebraska.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.359
Nebraska depends on
KapplerHays for jobs.

05:05.393 --> 05:07.461
The attorney general's
never gonna go hard at them.

05:07.495 --> 05:09.596
But their headquarters
are here in Manhattan,

05:09.631 --> 05:11.465
so we can get them
in the Southern District.

05:11.499 --> 05:12.533
It's a big case to make.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.269
It is. But the EPA
and state regulatory authorities

05:15.303 --> 05:16.937
have already done so much to make it.

05:16.971 --> 05:18.499
We just need to pull it all together.

05:20.008 --> 05:22.309
You look like Seth Oliver.
Even sound like him.

05:22.343 --> 05:23.444
Let me do this.

05:23.478 --> 05:26.246
Yeah, but I can't use resources
on a case we can't win.

05:26.281 --> 05:27.915
I'm not Rocky Balboa.

05:27.949 --> 05:30.451
Rocky did win. He beat Ivan Drago.

05:30.485 --> 05:32.753
I meant the first one.

05:32.787 --> 05:35.289
He just wants to go the dist... Wait.

05:37.192 --> 05:39.326
You've seen "Rocky IV",
but not the original?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.161
- Four is a classic.
- It's four!

05:41.196 --> 05:43.964
Let me do this. I can win.

05:43.998 --> 05:45.799
Okay, but on the condition

05:45.834 --> 05:48.235
that you rent "Rocky"... the first one...

05:48.269 --> 05:51.238
and tell me if there's
a better movie anywhere.

05:51.272 --> 05:52.706
That's literally a condition!

05:54.175 --> 05:56.110
- Cool if I sit?
- No.

05:56.144 --> 05:58.345
So, here's the scenario.
Let's say you embezzled...

05:58.379 --> 05:59.046
I would never embezzle.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.124
- But if you did.
- I didn't.

06:00.148 --> 06:02.416
- What would you spend the money on?
- What money?

06:02.450 --> 06:04.128
- The money you embezzled.
- I didn't embezzle.

06:04.152 --> 06:05.352
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

06:05.386 --> 06:06.653
I finished the discovery binder

06:06.688 --> 06:07.965
for the Stewart International case.

06:07.989 --> 06:09.469
Thanks, Tony. You can leave it there.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.527
You got any big plans for the weekend?

06:13.561 --> 06:15.229
Going through this.

06:16.197 --> 06:18.008
If you need a break,
a bunch of us are going over

06:18.032 --> 06:20.367
to the Jazz Age Lawn Party
on Governors Island.

06:20.401 --> 06:21.531
You should come.

06:24.506 --> 06:26.673
I probably won't have time,
but thanks for the invite.

06:26.708 --> 06:30.644
Okay, well, if anything changes,
you have my number.

06:35.383 --> 06:37.618
- That was real cold.
- What?

06:37.652 --> 06:39.386
He likes you. He sent up a test balloon

06:39.420 --> 06:41.688
and you shot it down. Cold.

06:41.723 --> 06:43.357
II'm not interested.

06:44.859 --> 06:46.237
- If you were interested...
- I'm not!

06:46.261 --> 06:47.394
- But if...
- I'm...

06:47.428 --> 06:49.329
I have to move floors.

06:49.364 --> 06:50.397
I did it.

06:50.431 --> 06:52.209
Opened a criminal investigation
into KapplerHays.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.100
Subpoenas are out.

06:53.134 --> 06:54.801
You're going up against KapplerHays?

06:54.836 --> 06:56.370
You both have offices, right?

06:56.404 --> 06:57.905
You know every big firm in New York

06:57.939 --> 06:59.316
is trying to get that case now, right?

06:59.340 --> 07:01.208
Right now. As we speak.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.509
And the firm that does get it

07:02.544 --> 07:04.211
is gonna spare no expense to destroy you,

07:04.245 --> 07:05.928
and they will salt the earth
when they are done.

07:05.952 --> 07:06.999
Is this a pep talk?

07:07.024 --> 07:08.864
I just want you to know
what you're up against.

07:13.101 --> 07:14.869
I think I do know.

07:15.056 --> 07:17.324
- Todd.
- Seth.

07:17.358 --> 07:19.426
- How are you?
- Great. Thanks for coming.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.328
Thanks for, inviting me.

07:21.362 --> 07:23.997
- We miss you at the firm, Seth.
- Well, I miss being there.

07:24.032 --> 07:25.417
You should.

07:25.452 --> 07:27.411
I mean, you have the best job
in the world, obviously,

07:27.435 --> 07:28.612
but there's a lot of great stuff

07:28.636 --> 07:30.003
happening at Stillman right now.

07:30.038 --> 07:31.905
- We have nap pods.
- Nap pods?

07:31.940 --> 07:33.674
I just woke up 15 minutes ago.

07:33.708 --> 07:35.442
Can you tell I was asleep?

07:35.476 --> 07:37.077
Look at me. Seriously. Can you tell?

07:38.079 --> 07:40.380
II guess... aa little bit.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.916
- Maybe around your eyes.
- No, you cannot! Right?

07:42.951 --> 07:44.271
That's what I'm saying.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.752
These things are amazing.

07:45.787 --> 07:47.888
We have a whole
onsite wellness center.

07:47.922 --> 07:48.822
It makes a difference.

07:48.856 --> 07:50.624
Meditation and bee pollen every morning

07:50.658 --> 07:51.925
means less partners screaming.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.527
I heard you made partner.

07:53.561 --> 07:55.395
In record time.

07:55.430 --> 07:57.097
Three years in the Southern District

07:57.131 --> 07:58.532
doing your job, and they minted me.

07:58.566 --> 08:00.400
And it'll probably be even faster for you

08:00.435 --> 08:03.237
because you already have
your first client lined up.

08:03.271 --> 08:05.806
Let me guess. KapplerHays.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.474
You didn't need to guess.

08:07.508 --> 08:09.443
You're smart. And they're smart.

08:09.477 --> 08:11.445
For hiring the former firm
of the prosecutor.

08:11.479 --> 08:13.480
Former firm. Future firm.

08:13.514 --> 08:15.048
Yes. It's smart.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.827
Listen, you're gonna be
surprised to hear this,

08:16.851 --> 08:19.219
but I'm glad you put
pressure on KapplerHays

08:19.254 --> 08:20.921
by opening this investigation.

08:20.955 --> 08:23.323
It was the right thing to do.
They know they messed up.

08:23.358 --> 08:26.493
The CEO, Jack Lewis,
is personall overseeing

08:26.527 --> 08:28.895
the creation of a $50million health fund

08:28.930 --> 08:31.031
for any affected child in Lincoln.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.166
I ordered you the chop.

08:33.201 --> 08:36.470
They're also putting in
new inspection protocols,

08:36.504 --> 08:40.407
reforming the entire system
of safety measures companywide,

08:40.441 --> 08:43.176
beyond anything the Nebraska AG
and EPA are asking.

08:43.211 --> 08:45.479
And that's because of you.

08:45.513 --> 08:48.282
Look, we're technically
across the table here,

08:48.316 --> 08:49.716
but we all want the same thing.

08:51.119 --> 08:53.487
Okay, so here's what we do.

08:53.521 --> 08:55.622
Let's make a deal that gives you a win

08:55.657 --> 08:57.291
and gets the company on the right track,

08:57.325 --> 08:59.436
and, most importantly, gets
the community taken care of...

08:59.460 --> 09:00.494
your community.

09:00.528 --> 09:02.462
My only ask in all of this

09:02.497 --> 09:06.867
is just don't jump the gun
and file charges.

09:06.901 --> 09:09.102
Because that would be
unproductive right now.

09:09.137 --> 09:10.604
For the good people of Lincoln.

09:10.638 --> 09:12.939
For you. And the firm.
For you and the firm.

09:12.974 --> 09:14.675
I know you know how this works.

09:14.709 --> 09:17.177
I know the kind of lawyer you are, Seth.

09:27.511 --> 09:29.446
- Dead as a doornail.
- Good.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.514
Remind me not to let you
write my obituary.

09:31.549 --> 09:33.650
Hey, we had an agreement. It breaks...

09:33.684 --> 09:34.818
We go automated, I know.

09:34.852 --> 09:37.854
I've got IT installing the
random selection software now.

09:37.888 --> 09:38.988
By the end of the day,

09:39.023 --> 09:42.692
I will be assigning judges
with the push of a button.

09:42.726 --> 09:44.727
Welcome to the 20th century.

09:47.331 --> 09:49.966
No, you can leave it here.
My clerks will get rid of it.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.234
I'll take care of it.

09:51.268 --> 09:53.636
II could really use the firewood.

10:01.579 --> 10:03.079
We need to talk to you about Chloe.

10:03.113 --> 10:04.581
- Is she here?
- Not yet.

10:04.615 --> 10:06.416
She's late. Have you tried calling her?

10:06.450 --> 10:08.918
She doesn't live in that building.

10:08.953 --> 10:10.146
What are you talking about?

10:10.180 --> 10:11.888
She told you she lived in that building.

10:11.922 --> 10:13.823
She said she was checking her mail,

10:13.858 --> 10:14.891
like she does every day.

10:14.925 --> 10:16.926
She hasn't lived in that
building for four years.

10:16.961 --> 10:18.061
Maybe I misunderstood.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.207
She told you that she was
the one who called the police,

10:20.231 --> 10:21.598
but it was actually the doorman.

10:21.632 --> 10:22.676
We need to get her in here.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.767
There are other inconsistencies
with her story.

10:24.802 --> 10:26.936
Chloe?

10:26.971 --> 10:29.572
I ccan't...

10:29.607 --> 10:31.040
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

10:31.075 --> 10:32.208
Where are you?

10:32.243 --> 10:34.577
I will come to you, but you have
to tell me where you are.

10:34.612 --> 10:35.845
I just went for a walk,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.380
and I must've gotten turned around...

10:37.414 --> 10:39.048
Can you... Can you look for a sign?

10:39.083 --> 10:42.619
Chloe, you need to tell me
where in Penn Station you are.

10:42.653 --> 10:45.054
Chloe? Chloe?

10:47.892 --> 10:49.192
Chloe.

10:51.762 --> 10:52.762
Chloe!

10:54.498 --> 10:55.765
You're here.

10:55.799 --> 10:57.734
Are you her sister?

10:57.768 --> 10:59.702
What? No.

10:59.737 --> 11:01.304
You should take her home.

11:01.338 --> 11:03.473
She tried to jump in front of a train.

11:20.824 --> 11:22.492
This is distracting.

11:22.526 --> 11:23.927
- What?
- You.

11:23.961 --> 11:25.051
I'm not doing anything.

11:25.086 --> 11:26.963
You're brooding. I don't like it.

11:26.997 --> 11:28.831
I need to talk to someone.

11:28.866 --> 11:31.668
At least it's not in my
office. I have five minutes.

11:31.702 --> 11:33.912
Not you. I'm sorry.

11:33.947 --> 11:35.772
God. Don't be sorry.

11:42.112 --> 11:43.846
You called me from your work phone.

11:43.881 --> 11:45.081
I did.

11:45.115 --> 11:46.683
- So, this is about work?
- Yes.

11:46.717 --> 11:48.785
Good.

11:48.819 --> 11:50.753
- This is weird.
- It is.

11:50.788 --> 11:52.589
But you know me better than anyone else,

11:52.623 --> 11:53.823
and I need your advice.

11:53.857 --> 11:55.625
You got one block.

11:56.727 --> 11:58.661
Okay, you know how the plan was

11:58.696 --> 12:01.130
that after a few years
in the U.S. Attorney's Office,

12:01.165 --> 12:02.799
I'd go back to Stillman Pearce,

12:02.833 --> 12:04.834
- but as a partner?
- Yeah.

12:04.868 --> 12:05.919
The company I'm investigating

12:05.943 --> 12:07.280
hired the firm as outside counsel.

12:07.304 --> 12:08.972
And Todd Hardart... Remember him?

12:09.006 --> 12:10.306
- No.
- Really?

12:10.341 --> 12:11.841
I can't even tell what you're saying.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.676
Hardhart? Hardart? I'd remember.

12:13.711 --> 12:16.212
Anyway, he told me that
the company's already agreeing

12:16.246 --> 12:18.982
to do the things I would have asked
them to do if I brought charges,

12:19.016 --> 12:20.383
without me bringing charges.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.151
- You believe that?
- I looked into it.

12:22.186 --> 12:24.026
They are. Doing the things
Todd said they were.

12:24.054 --> 12:25.855
Could you get more
if you brought charges?

12:25.889 --> 12:27.657
- I don't know.
- You know.

12:28.726 --> 12:31.327
If I file charges,
I think I can get more.

12:31.362 --> 12:33.229
More money. More reforms.

12:33.263 --> 12:34.897
Send a stronger message to the industry

12:34.932 --> 12:36.866
that this is intolerable.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.348
I'll tell you this...

12:38.382 --> 12:42.405
if you could stand up to me
and say the things you said,

12:42.439 --> 12:43.850
why can't you stand up to a company?

12:43.874 --> 12:45.742
And if it's because it ruins your plan

12:45.776 --> 12:47.644
to be a lawyer at a big, corporate firm,

12:47.678 --> 12:50.613
maybe you should think about
whether that's such a great plan.

12:51.715 --> 12:53.716
One block.

12:53.751 --> 12:56.185
We could do this, you know?

12:56.220 --> 12:58.655
Maybe. Be friends?

12:59.957 --> 13:03.026
You made a choice to be independent.

13:03.060 --> 13:05.028
To be a man.

13:05.062 --> 13:07.030
I am trying my best to respect that.

13:08.232 --> 13:10.700
Don't let them underestimate you, Seth.

13:10.734 --> 13:12.769
Like I did.

13:26.917 --> 13:29.218
They spilled poison
near my Annie's school.

13:29.253 --> 13:32.789
Now she has headaches, she gets dizzy,

13:32.823 --> 13:34.791
she's losing her hair.

13:34.825 --> 13:37.860
My boy's seven, and the
doctor says he needs dialysis.

13:37.895 --> 13:40.897
And they keep saying
this was an accident.

13:40.931 --> 13:43.933
I'm proud of our commitment
to the environment,

13:43.967 --> 13:45.902
to the public health.

13:45.936 --> 13:48.204
For me, it's a sacred trust.

14:10.994 --> 14:12.662
I'm gonna bring criminal charges.

14:12.696 --> 14:14.330
Same suit. Same conversation.

14:14.364 --> 14:16.109
I told you to rent "Rocky",
not "Groundhog Day".

14:16.133 --> 14:17.243
I'm gonna bring criminal charges

14:17.267 --> 14:20.903
against the CEO of KapplerHays,
Jack Lewis, personally.

14:20.938 --> 14:23.506
- This sounds personal.
- It is personal.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.984
He was the person who made the decisions

14:25.008 --> 14:26.509
that led to these crimes.

14:26.543 --> 14:27.977
The fines are meaningless.

14:28.011 --> 14:30.446
KapplerHays is a $22billion company.

14:30.481 --> 14:33.182
$50 million is just another cell
in their accounting software.

14:33.217 --> 14:36.352
The public needs to see
someone go to jail... a person.

14:36.386 --> 14:38.354
That's the only way
to show that we're serious.

14:38.388 --> 14:40.866
- What do you have?
- The EPA interviewed multiple witnesses

14:40.900 --> 14:43.693
who can testify that Jack Lewis
knew about these leaks

14:43.727 --> 14:46.249
and chose not to remediate them
because of cost.

14:46.284 --> 14:47.777
They're gonna want to cut a deal.

14:47.811 --> 14:49.832
Guilty plea. Minimal time. No trial.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.135
I'm not looking to try a case
against Stillman Pearce.

14:52.169 --> 14:55.338
As long as Lewis does jail time,
I'll cut a deal.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.274
But he needs to go to jail.

15:09.721 --> 15:11.955
I hired a psychiatrist
to do a full evaluation

15:11.990 --> 15:13.067
to see what we're dealing with.

15:13.091 --> 15:15.693
- Where's Sandra?
- Sandra doesn't like hospitals.

15:15.727 --> 15:18.062
- Who likes hospitals?
- It's different with Sandra.

15:18.096 --> 15:19.129
What are we dealing with?

15:19.164 --> 15:21.799
Chloe was on the edge
of the tracks at Penn Station

15:21.833 --> 15:23.033
and speaking incoherently.

15:23.068 --> 15:24.968
She says she gets lost often.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.771
So, we could be dealing with
an insanity defense?

15:27.806 --> 15:29.873
Mental disorder defense. But yes.

15:29.908 --> 15:32.810
I'm sure it explains all of the
inconsistencies in her story.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.878
You need to wait for
the psychiatrist's report

15:34.913 --> 15:36.157
while I start preparing our papers.

15:36.181 --> 15:37.681
Chloe may need to be committed.

15:43.021 --> 15:44.988
Are you not into guys?
Is that what this is about?

15:45.023 --> 15:47.458
It has nothing to do with gender.

15:47.492 --> 15:49.927
Then is it because
he went to a state school?

15:49.961 --> 15:51.962
I went to a state school.

15:51.996 --> 15:53.931
Nothing wrong with that.

15:53.965 --> 15:55.999
If I went to that
music festival with Tony,

15:56.034 --> 15:57.812
he'd buy me a hot dog,
we'd listen to some bands,

15:57.836 --> 15:59.480
then we'd go back to his place
and we'd have sex.

15:59.504 --> 16:00.971
I don't want that. What's the point?

16:01.005 --> 16:02.606
Of the music festival? I don't know.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.607
Any of it.

16:03.641 --> 16:05.909
Well, some of it could be fun.

16:05.944 --> 16:07.311
I don't want fun.

16:07.345 --> 16:10.781
I want challenging.
Interesting. Stimulating.

16:10.815 --> 16:12.616
Fun is... What your 20s are for.

16:12.650 --> 16:13.617
I'm practically 30.

16:13.651 --> 16:14.662
That's a terrible attitude.

16:14.686 --> 16:16.320
It's the truth.

16:16.354 --> 16:18.589
I'm not saying you have to
get blackout drunk

16:18.623 --> 16:21.091
and wake up on a small boat
in Peru. True story.

16:21.126 --> 16:23.160
You can go out every once in a while.

16:23.194 --> 16:25.028
- With Tony?
- With anybody.

16:25.063 --> 16:27.475
Find somebody you like and send
up a test balloon of your own.

16:27.499 --> 16:30.100
This is sounding a lot
like middle school.

16:30.135 --> 16:32.436
- I hated middle school.
- Everyone hated middle school.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.037
This is different. You're cool now.

16:34.072 --> 16:36.473
You're interesting,
you're smart and attractive...

16:36.508 --> 16:37.808
you're a catch.

16:37.842 --> 16:40.177
I don't want to be caught.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.620
- Nothing?
- The psychiatric testing

16:49.654 --> 16:51.989
showed no mental
or cognitive issues of any kind.

16:52.023 --> 16:53.991
They even did a bunch
of lab work. Nothing.

16:54.025 --> 16:55.236
We need to find another doctor.

16:55.260 --> 16:56.727
You said he was the best.

16:56.761 --> 16:57.861
Is it at least possible

16:57.896 --> 16:59.140
she's faking a mental condition?

16:59.164 --> 17:01.285
She almost threw herself in
front of a train.

17:01.310 --> 17:02.351
But she didn't.

17:02.385 --> 17:04.078
Maybe there's some history
with her and this mail carrier.

17:04.102 --> 17:05.715
Maybe there's a whole
different angle on this.

17:05.740 --> 17:06.667
I don't think so.

17:06.702 --> 17:07.815
She lied about everything else.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.215
Why wouldn't she be lying
about this, too?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.141
This isn't a potential
murder case anymore.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.844
The mail carrier is recovering.
One of us can take this now.

17:13.877 --> 17:15.279
I need to talk to Chloe.

17:17.582 --> 17:20.684
Okay, am I, like, missing something here?

17:20.718 --> 17:23.086
Apparently, we all are.

17:23.121 --> 17:25.888
KapplerHays' chairman
and CEO, Jack Lewis,

17:25.924 --> 17:27.208
was arrested today,

17:27.242 --> 17:29.827
charged with multiple criminal violations

17:29.861 --> 17:31.496
of the Clean Water Act...

17:31.530 --> 17:34.565
a highly unusual,
highly personal prosecution

17:34.599 --> 17:37.244
that Mr. Lewis's attorneys have indicated

17:37.279 --> 17:40.003
they intend to fight
in every way possible.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.151
- Todd.
- Seth.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.708
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for... inviting me.

17:44.742 --> 17:46.710
Listen, Todd.

17:46.744 --> 17:49.746
I just want to say,
before we get started,

17:49.781 --> 17:52.118
this isn't personal, obviously.

17:52.152 --> 17:54.918
II have a lot of respect
for you and Stillman.

17:54.953 --> 17:58.422
And I really value
my association with the firm.

17:58.456 --> 18:00.731
- The respect goes both ways, Seth.
- Thank you.

18:00.765 --> 18:02.960
Yeah, seriously. I'm impressed.

18:02.994 --> 18:06.530
This. You. How far you've come.

18:06.564 --> 18:08.687
I was riding up in the elevator just now

18:08.721 --> 18:09.721
thinking back to the day

18:09.746 --> 18:11.134
you interviewed here.

18:11.169 --> 18:14.438
Roger Gunn calls me
the minute you left the office

18:14.472 --> 18:16.867
and says, "You have to be
kidding me. This guy?"...

18:16.901 --> 18:19.209
meaning you.

18:19.244 --> 18:22.079
And I say, "No. Trust me. He's good."

18:22.113 --> 18:24.581
But Roger's totally
dug in on this... you.

18:24.616 --> 18:26.149
"No way."

18:26.184 --> 18:27.651
More colorful language, obviously.

18:27.685 --> 18:28.752
But he's not budging.

18:28.786 --> 18:30.921
I'm sure you guys
have laughed about this, right?

18:30.955 --> 18:32.256
Ha ha.

18:32.290 --> 18:35.292
So, I go back to Ron Stillman
and he's like,

18:35.326 --> 18:37.227
"Well, he can't stay here at the firm.

18:37.262 --> 18:38.328
He's not cutting it."

18:38.363 --> 18:39.663
"He" meaning you.

18:39.697 --> 18:42.900
So, I call Roger
and push and push and beg,

18:42.934 --> 18:45.068
and finally, we get him to take you.

18:45.103 --> 18:47.170
My powers of persuasion

18:47.205 --> 18:49.172
and a half dozen box seats
at Yankee Stadium

18:49.207 --> 18:50.507
can move mountains.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.609
And now look at you.

18:52.644 --> 18:54.845
Sitting there. Fearless.

18:54.879 --> 18:59.516
You have no future at Stillman
or any top firm in this city.

18:59.551 --> 19:01.952
You have no future in this office.

19:01.986 --> 19:03.244
Roger's not gonna be thrilled

19:03.278 --> 19:05.822
about a guy he didn't want
to hire coming off probation

19:05.857 --> 19:07.624
and getting his head handed to him.

19:07.659 --> 19:09.993
But you don't seem
to care about any of that.

19:11.796 --> 19:13.997
It's... impressive.

19:16.167 --> 19:20.170
Anyway, I think you called
me in to make an offer.

19:22.088 --> 19:23.717
I probably should've
said we're not looking

19:23.741 --> 19:25.142
for a deal on this anymore.

19:25.176 --> 19:28.045
We wanted to avoid criminal
charges. This spectacle.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.880
You went ahead anyway,
and now we're feeling

19:29.914 --> 19:32.279
a little less magnanimous.

19:32.884 --> 19:34.284
We'll see you at trial.

19:49.244 --> 19:51.979
Ms. Shore, you were KapplerHays'

19:52.013 --> 19:54.148
Deputy Chief Environmental
Commitment Officer

19:54.182 --> 19:55.883
- for how many years?
- 12 years.

19:55.917 --> 19:58.819
On March 9, 2012, did you and Mr. Lewis

19:58.854 --> 20:01.689
discuss the company's facility
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

20:01.723 --> 20:04.058
Yes. We had a big wastewater leak

20:04.092 --> 20:05.492
beneath the Lincoln plant.

20:05.527 --> 20:07.061
Chemicals were leaking into the water,

20:07.095 --> 20:08.227
spreading through the soil.

20:08.261 --> 20:09.830
Right next to Carver Elementary.

20:09.865 --> 20:12.132
I told him that we needed to
make critical upgrades.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.543
What did Jack Lewis say

20:13.577 --> 20:15.379
when you told him you need
to make these upgrades?

20:15.403 --> 20:18.239
He said he didn't want to
spend the money.

20:18.273 --> 20:20.263
Do you recognize
this document, Ms. Shore?

20:20.297 --> 20:22.243
It's my mortgage application.

20:22.277 --> 20:23.406
And you swore to tell the truth

20:23.430 --> 20:25.913
under penalty of perjury
on this form, correct?

20:25.947 --> 20:27.147
- Correct.
- Did you?

20:27.182 --> 20:29.717
I misstated my assets.

20:29.751 --> 20:31.485
You lied. Because you wanted something.

20:31.519 --> 20:34.154
- Objection. Counsel is testifying...
- Overruled.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.353
Just like you're lying today

20:35.388 --> 20:36.901
so you can avoid being held responsible

20:36.925 --> 20:39.860
for alleged environmental crimes
that were in your portfolio.

20:41.463 --> 20:43.097
As head of Intergovernmental Affairs,

20:43.131 --> 20:44.265
you urged Mr. Lewis

20:44.299 --> 20:47.401
to bring the Lincoln plant
into compliance to obey the law,

20:47.435 --> 20:49.069
- is that right?
- Yes.

20:49.104 --> 20:51.906
I told him that we were doing
damage to that community,

20:51.940 --> 20:54.441
that state legislators
were sounding alarm bells.

20:54.476 --> 20:57.111
- His response?
- He told me to get out of his office.

20:57.145 --> 20:59.580
He told me I was the alarmist.

20:59.614 --> 21:02.683
- Mr. Cantor, you are divorced, correct?
- I am.

21:02.717 --> 21:03.847
And is it true, Mr. Cantor,

21:03.882 --> 21:05.719
that during your divorce proceedings,

21:05.754 --> 21:07.955
you swore under oath
that you were at all times

21:07.989 --> 21:10.229
faithful to your wife during
the course of your marriage?

21:11.626 --> 21:13.694
- That's correct.
- Isn't it true, Mr. Cantor,

21:13.728 --> 21:15.262
that, while married to Lily Cantor,

21:15.297 --> 21:17.031
you attended sex parties
at a private club

21:17.065 --> 21:18.709
- called "Venom" at least 16 times...
- Objection!

21:18.733 --> 21:20.301
To what? The name "Venom"?

21:20.335 --> 21:23.081
Mr. Cantor's sex life is
completely irrelevant.

21:23.106 --> 21:25.249
This isn't about his sex life.
This is about his credibility.

21:25.273 --> 21:26.273
I'll allow it.

21:27.943 --> 21:30.778
Mr. Cantor, you have shown
an alarming ability to lie

21:30.812 --> 21:31.972
in order to protect yourself.

21:32.005 --> 21:33.881
Is there any reason
for this jury to believe

21:33.915 --> 21:36.216
that you are not doing
the exact same thing here?

21:43.258 --> 21:46.093
Crankshaft just needs
a little TLC is all.

21:46.127 --> 21:47.661
I'll fix it up, free of charge.

21:47.696 --> 21:48.988
You don't have to do that.

21:49.022 --> 21:51.165
It's no trouble.
Just happy she's still in use.

21:51.199 --> 21:55.736
Everybody's got smartphones
and... and search engines.

21:55.770 --> 21:58.405
I get it. I like the Internet, too,

21:58.440 --> 22:00.774
but do you know who made the Internet?

22:00.809 --> 22:02.743
That curlyhaired kid from the movie?

22:02.777 --> 22:04.611
I haven't the faintest idea.

22:04.646 --> 22:07.982
What I do know is that
I carved this handle.

22:08.016 --> 22:09.516
I soldered this joint.

22:09.551 --> 22:11.151
There's a crack in this corner.

22:11.186 --> 22:12.686
That's you...

22:12.721 --> 22:15.389
and all the people who've used her since.

22:17.525 --> 22:19.293
Sorry about the place.

22:19.327 --> 22:22.329
Moved in such a hurry
and haven't had time to...

22:22.364 --> 22:24.164
Started a new job.

22:24.199 --> 22:26.033
Here's some milk.

22:26.067 --> 22:27.134
Thank you.

22:27.168 --> 22:31.171
So... the doctor said
he couldn't find anything wrong.

22:31.206 --> 22:34.441
No. They never do.

22:34.476 --> 22:37.678
Over the last five years,
I've been called,

22:37.712 --> 22:41.815
"stressed," "depressed,"
"moody," "premenopausal."

22:41.850 --> 22:44.685
I've had blood tests, thyroid tests,

22:44.719 --> 22:47.521
Chinese tea, acupuncture.

22:47.555 --> 22:50.724
The only thing that came close
to working was paroxetine,

22:50.759 --> 22:53.494
but I didn't feel like myself.

22:53.528 --> 22:55.362
Mitchell... that's my ex...

22:55.397 --> 22:57.831
he wanted me to stay on it.

22:57.866 --> 23:00.446
We fought.

23:01.503 --> 23:03.337
I think it's hard
to live with a crazy person.

23:03.371 --> 23:05.506
Can we not say "crazy"?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.374
But I thought that was my defense.

23:07.409 --> 23:09.143
It was, Chloe.

23:09.177 --> 23:12.713
But... the psychiatrist
didn't find anything,

23:12.747 --> 23:14.581
and I need to explore with you

23:14.616 --> 23:17.051
if maybe there's something else
going on here.

23:17.085 --> 23:18.886
Something you might not have told me.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.119
Do you not believe me?

23:20.153 --> 23:22.423
It's... not about what I believe, Chloe.

23:22.457 --> 23:25.262
It's about what the jury will believe.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.362
That's okay. I understand.
I'm used to it.

23:28.396 --> 23:31.268
Maybe we can talk more
about the incident.

23:32.534 --> 23:33.960
Did you have any history

23:33.985 --> 23:35.335
- with the mail carrier?
- No.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.381
- Why were you in the building that day?
- I don't know.

23:37.405 --> 23:38.597
I'm your attorney.

23:38.632 --> 23:40.407
Anything you say to me is protected.

23:40.442 --> 23:41.942
My son got frustrated, too.

23:41.976 --> 23:43.444
I'm not frustrated.

23:43.478 --> 23:46.213
He doesn't want much
to do with me these days.

23:46.247 --> 23:47.281
I don't blame him.

23:47.315 --> 23:50.517
He needed his mom to be
the same person day to day.

23:50.552 --> 23:53.053
She's not much of a mom.

23:53.088 --> 23:54.965
Let's talk about why you felt
you were in danger...

23:54.989 --> 23:56.208
I wasn't always like this.

23:56.242 --> 23:57.635
In college, I was on the Dean's list...

23:57.659 --> 23:59.193
Have you been attacked before?

23:59.227 --> 24:00.304
Gamma Delta Gamma president.

24:00.328 --> 24:02.629
I was a cheerleader.
I went abroad my junior year...

24:02.664 --> 24:04.798
Maybe there's still
a selfdefense argument.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.433
That's when I met Mitchell...

24:06.468 --> 24:07.679
Wait.

24:08.603 --> 24:09.803
You were a cheerleader?

24:09.838 --> 24:11.438
Since I was 14.

24:11.473 --> 24:13.340
National champions one year.

24:16.144 --> 24:17.444
Why?

24:18.780 --> 24:20.881
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,

24:20.915 --> 24:24.051
a degenerative brain disease from
years as a competitive cheerleader.

24:24.085 --> 24:25.322
I thought CTE was caused by

24:25.357 --> 24:26.630
years of getting clobbered
playing football.

24:26.654 --> 24:28.522
It's also caused by this...

24:31.459 --> 24:34.294
Cheerleading causes half
of all catastrophic injuries

24:34.329 --> 24:35.863
in female athletes.

24:37.499 --> 24:38.509
I watch a lot of "SportsCenter."

24:38.533 --> 24:40.501
- I've never heard of this.
- Most people haven't.

24:40.535 --> 24:43.570
But CTE explains
everything about Chloe...

24:43.605 --> 24:45.472
confusion, rage, memory loss...

24:45.507 --> 24:47.251
Why didn't this come up
in the psychiatric evaluation?

24:47.275 --> 24:49.726
Because it doesn't show up
on a psychiatric evaluation.

24:49.751 --> 24:50.964
Well, how do you test for it?

24:50.999 --> 24:52.078
There is no test for it.

24:52.112 --> 24:54.815
It's diagnosed at death with an autopsy.

24:54.849 --> 24:56.652
I watch a lot of "SportsCenter," too.

24:56.686 --> 24:58.452
That has been the only way,

24:58.486 --> 25:00.521
but there's a doctor, here in New York,

25:00.555 --> 25:02.122
Alexander Cole, working on a new test.

25:02.157 --> 25:03.345
That won't be admissible.

25:03.380 --> 25:06.927
Then your job is to make it admissible!

25:06.961 --> 25:08.105
So now you have something to do

25:08.129 --> 25:10.164
instead of just standing there.

25:10.198 --> 25:12.633
She has CTE, and we're gonna get
her tested,

25:12.667 --> 25:16.103
and then we'll know and she will know.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.762
Again? I don't like it.

25:31.419 --> 25:33.220
I need to talk to someone.

25:33.254 --> 25:34.999
So, talk to whoever it was
you talked to last time.

25:35.023 --> 25:37.001
- That seemed to work.
- That got me into this mess.

25:37.025 --> 25:39.229
God. I have to sit down now, don't I?

25:43.264 --> 25:44.498
My case is falling apart,

25:44.532 --> 25:47.301
I'm getting humiliated by Todd Hardart...

25:47.335 --> 25:48.635
Hardhart?

25:48.670 --> 25:50.070
Sorry, what are you saying?

25:50.104 --> 25:51.138
My old firm.

25:51.172 --> 25:54.007
They've got an army
of associates working 24/7,

25:54.042 --> 25:55.509
digging up anything and everything

25:55.543 --> 25:56.910
to discredit my witnesses.

25:56.945 --> 25:58.512
They're pummeling me.

25:58.546 --> 26:01.915
I'm letting everyone down...
my mom, Jenny, Theo.

26:01.950 --> 26:03.561
This is why Roger didn't want to hire me.

26:03.585 --> 26:04.862
Roger probably didn't want to hire you

26:04.886 --> 26:06.430
because of the way you sound right now,

26:06.454 --> 26:08.008
which is incredibly whiny.

26:09.591 --> 26:10.891
Roger didn't want to hire you?

26:10.925 --> 26:12.051
That's what I was told.

26:12.085 --> 26:13.537
I was told that my feet were too small

26:13.561 --> 26:14.590
to be a competitive swimmer.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.291
And then you won
the state championship...

26:16.326 --> 26:18.751
No. Usually, I came in last,
but I didn't give up.

26:18.776 --> 26:19.817
I'm not giving up.

26:19.851 --> 26:22.469
- Is he giving up?
- I am not giving up!

26:26.107 --> 26:28.542
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do that. Don't apologize.

26:28.576 --> 26:30.444
Stay there.

26:30.478 --> 26:32.846
Now what do you need to do
to make your case?

26:33.575 --> 26:35.382
They destroyed my witnesses,

26:35.416 --> 26:36.750
but I have these memos,

26:36.784 --> 26:38.585
which show the company
knew about the leak

26:38.620 --> 26:40.420
and knew how much
it would cost to fix it.

26:40.455 --> 26:43.257
But you need someone to testify
Lewis actually saw them

26:43.291 --> 26:44.958
and decided not to do anything?

26:44.993 --> 26:47.861
Yes. But Jack Lewis is a powerful guy.

26:47.895 --> 26:49.096
People are scared of him.

26:49.130 --> 26:50.864
He flung a piece of bacon
at his secretary.

26:50.898 --> 26:53.634
Former secretary. I saw that
in the "Washington Post."

26:53.668 --> 26:56.348
Top 10 worst CEOs in America.

26:57.138 --> 26:58.809
The secretary!

26:59.807 --> 27:02.029
Now let's get to work.

27:05.726 --> 27:08.812
Ms. Davis, you were Jack
Lewis' secretary for nine months?

27:08.877 --> 27:12.380
Nine long months. I'm told it was
two weeks short of a record.

27:12.414 --> 27:13.848
That's why you're here today,

27:13.882 --> 27:15.950
to tell us about Mr. Lewis'
management style...

27:15.984 --> 27:16.984
Objection, Your Honor.

27:17.019 --> 27:18.953
The witness did clerical work.
Answered phones.

27:18.987 --> 27:19.954
She knows nothing about

27:19.988 --> 27:22.056
the highly specialized issues
in this case.

27:22.090 --> 27:24.558
She saw every piece of paper
that crossed his desk

27:24.593 --> 27:25.693
for nine months.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.429
This trial is about whether
he's personally responsible

27:28.463 --> 27:30.031
for his company spewing toxins.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.532
How is it not relevant?

27:31.566 --> 27:33.151
I'll allow it.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.738
Take us back to the morning
of March 20, 2016,

27:37.773 --> 27:39.073
your last day at the company.

27:39.107 --> 27:40.574
How'd that day begin?

27:40.609 --> 27:43.411
Mr. Lewis asked me for
a breakfast sandwich...

27:43.445 --> 27:45.046
egg and cheese on a roll.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.749
He specified egg and cheese on a roll...

27:48.784 --> 27:50.451
- Your Honor...
- Get to the point.

27:50.485 --> 27:52.230
You brought him the sandwich.
Then what happened?

27:52.254 --> 27:54.488
He flung a piece of bacon in my face.

27:54.523 --> 27:57.124
Did he say why
he flung bacon in your face?

27:57.159 --> 27:58.659
He didn't ask for bacon.

27:58.694 --> 28:02.797
He said, "Do only what
I tell you. No more. No less."

28:02.831 --> 28:06.133
He said that 50 times a day to everyone.

28:06.168 --> 28:07.468
That was his management style?

28:07.502 --> 28:09.403
Not a lot of style, but yes.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.340
He was a micromanager. About everything.

28:13.133 --> 28:15.976
I want to direct your attention
to these four memos,

28:16.011 --> 28:17.912
which have been marked as Exhibit J,

28:17.946 --> 28:20.514
written to Mr. Lewis
over a threeyear period.

28:20.549 --> 28:23.351
They estimate the cost of
complying with EPA regulations

28:23.385 --> 28:24.985
at KapplerHays' Lincoln plant.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.831
Objection. The witness
doesn't know the first thing

28:26.855 --> 28:28.923
about EPA regulations.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.591
If he can make bacon relevant,

28:30.625 --> 28:32.159
he gets a crack at this, too.

28:32.194 --> 28:33.694
Do you have an opinion, Ms. Davis,

28:33.729 --> 28:36.797
about whether Mr. Lewis
ever saw these memos?

28:36.832 --> 28:38.033
No.

28:41.536 --> 28:44.772
I mean, it's not an opinion.
He definitely saw them.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.841
No piece of paper
passed through the company

28:46.875 --> 28:48.876
without him reading and okaying it.

28:48.910 --> 28:51.612
And anyway, these memos
are covered with checkmarks

28:51.646 --> 28:54.281
in Mr. Lewis' handwriting.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.616
That's his writing.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.551
So, if Mr. Lewis contends he never knew

28:57.586 --> 29:01.021
his facilities were breaking
the law, poisoning children,

29:01.056 --> 29:02.890
do you have an opinion about that?

29:02.924 --> 29:04.725
That would be a lie.

29:15.871 --> 29:17.238
What are you seeing?

29:17.272 --> 29:19.707
I'm seeing high levels
of tau accumulation

29:19.741 --> 29:22.676
in the amygdala and in all
subcortical regions.

29:22.711 --> 29:23.888
That's where the damaged neurons are.

29:23.912 --> 29:25.246
And what does that mean?

29:25.280 --> 29:26.514
It means she has the brain

29:26.548 --> 29:29.083
of a 50yearold defensive lineman.

29:29.117 --> 29:30.885
It means you were right, Ms. Carlan.

29:30.919 --> 29:32.707
The pattern in which her brain lit up

29:32.741 --> 29:35.222
indicates an extremely high
likely that Ms. Daniels suffers

29:35.257 --> 29:37.825
from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

29:37.859 --> 29:38.659
I'm sorry.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.661
I need you to testify in a hearing

29:40.695 --> 29:43.097
so we can use this scan as evidence.

29:43.131 --> 29:44.316
This isn't FDA approved.

29:44.351 --> 29:46.100
It hasn't been tested widely enough.

29:46.134 --> 29:47.612
It'll never hold up in a court hearing.

29:47.636 --> 29:49.203
Yes, it will.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.539
We'll make sure of it.

29:56.945 --> 29:59.079
If you walk past the back door
of the library

29:59.114 --> 30:02.416
at Carver Elementary School
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

30:02.451 --> 30:04.852
you'll see a line of students.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.121
Almost anytime,
but always in the afternoon

30:07.155 --> 30:09.423
after lunch and recess.

30:09.458 --> 30:12.860
If you don't know Carver, it
looks a little odd. This line.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.063
Tucked behind a building,
pressed up against a hedge.

30:16.097 --> 30:18.699
But if you peek around the corner,

30:18.733 --> 30:19.897
you see it.

30:19.932 --> 30:22.136
You understand.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.704
A drinking fountain.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.706
Blue. Three heads.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.409
Always in the shade. Always cold.

30:29.102 --> 30:32.146
Carver opened in 1961,

30:32.180 --> 30:33.948
and nobody remembers why

30:33.982 --> 30:37.485
this drinking fountain
was put back there,

30:37.519 --> 30:41.455
but it's been a part
of the school for over 50 years.

30:41.490 --> 30:46.560
Future farmers, accountants,
mayor, an astronaut,

30:46.595 --> 30:50.264
doctors, a few lawyers.

30:50.298 --> 30:54.002
They all drank the cold water
from the library fountain.

30:54.836 --> 30:57.471
So did Theo Mars...

30:57.506 --> 31:02.076
every day for the last two years.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.677
He's seven now.

31:03.712 --> 31:09.116
Wants to be a scientist
or a racecar driver.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.452
He's still deciding.

31:11.486 --> 31:13.821
Either way, it's going to be a challenge

31:13.855 --> 31:18.192
because Theo has Leukemia.

31:18.226 --> 31:22.630
Because of the library fountain.

31:22.664 --> 31:28.602
Because Jack Lewis built a plant
next to the school

31:28.637 --> 31:32.506
and allowed toxins
to seep into the cold water

31:32.541 --> 31:34.308
that Theo and his classmates at Carver

31:34.342 --> 31:36.510
lined up to drink every day.

31:36.545 --> 31:40.014
Jack Lewis knew this water
was contaminated.

31:40.048 --> 31:44.051
He knew this contaminated water
was making kids sick.

31:44.085 --> 31:45.786
And he knew how to stop it.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.656
And Jack Lewis said no.

31:51.593 --> 31:53.661
What will you say now?

31:53.695 --> 31:56.130
Because there are only two sides here...

31:56.164 --> 32:00.134
KapplerHays or Carver Elementary.

32:00.168 --> 32:04.338
Jack Lewis or Theo Mars.

32:04.372 --> 32:06.106
The choice is yours.

32:09.210 --> 32:14.648
Carver Elementary is...
unremarkable in a lot of ways.

32:14.683 --> 32:20.688
But... it has real spirit.

32:20.722 --> 32:24.658
Heart. Character.

32:30.632 --> 32:33.334
There's a saying at the school...

32:33.368 --> 32:35.669
"Never count a Carver kid out."

32:38.807 --> 32:42.843
So... don't.

32:46.609 --> 32:48.698
Your Honor, the government
strongly objects

32:48.723 --> 32:50.721
to the admission
of any experimental tests...

32:50.756 --> 32:53.363
They weren't done by some kid
with a chemistry set.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.524
They come from one of the
world's leading CTE researchers.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.993
And while we sincerely hope they
yield results in the future,

32:59.027 --> 33:00.094
in the present,

33:00.129 --> 33:03.030
the only reliable diagnosis
of CTE is through autopsy.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.300
Well, my client prefers not to
wait for her autopsy results

33:06.335 --> 33:07.401
to mount her defense.

33:07.436 --> 33:09.570
Your Honor, if she had a diagnosis

33:09.605 --> 33:10.571
of Alzheimer's disease,

33:10.606 --> 33:12.974
we wouldn't be begging
for it to be admitted,

33:13.008 --> 33:16.144
unless this was 1983.

33:16.178 --> 33:17.378
If she were a diabetic,

33:17.412 --> 33:19.480
I could argue low insulin as a factor,

33:19.515 --> 33:21.382
but not 20 years ago.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.918
Every new thing we learn
about mental illness,

33:23.952 --> 33:27.088
we learn from a study
that started as experimental.

33:27.122 --> 33:30.391
Chloe Daniels has a disease,
and she shouldn't be punished

33:30.425 --> 33:33.027
for her bad timing in getting it.

33:33.061 --> 33:36.330
Mental illness has always
been problematic for us.

33:36.365 --> 33:39.433
At one point, schizophrenics
were burned as witches.

33:39.468 --> 33:41.836
Depressives were lobotomized.

33:41.870 --> 33:44.372
Women with anxiety were sterilized.

33:44.406 --> 33:46.541
It seems like so long ago, right?

33:46.575 --> 33:48.576
But out there, now,

33:48.610 --> 33:51.612
lives are being wasted in institutions,

33:51.647 --> 33:53.347
families broken up.

33:53.382 --> 33:57.051
People are living and dying
under overpasses

33:57.085 --> 34:01.422
because they have no idea
that a pill could fix it.

34:01.456 --> 34:06.227
Chloe Daniels has lost a marriage, a son,

34:06.261 --> 34:09.362
and, soon... her life.

34:09.398 --> 34:11.465
Even if we can show that she has CTE,

34:11.500 --> 34:13.868
a cure is a long way off.

34:13.902 --> 34:15.570
She has a disease,

34:15.603 --> 34:18.206
and letting us mount her best defense,

34:18.239 --> 34:21.809
all we're really deciding
is whether she dies of it

34:21.842 --> 34:25.580
in prison or out.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.485
They offered a deferred
prosecution agreement.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.487
Essentially a term of probation.

34:33.522 --> 34:36.958
She'll be supervised by
pretrial services for two years.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.768
That's good.

34:39.695 --> 34:41.329
You don't look good.

34:41.362 --> 34:43.598
She needs help,

34:43.632 --> 34:46.266
someone to take care of her.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.936
This disease is degenerative.
She's only gonna get worse.

34:48.971 --> 34:50.156
What about her family?

34:50.190 --> 34:52.672
Her son doesn't want anything
to do with her.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.942
She's burned every bridge.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.248
My sister was like that.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.751
I have a sister.

35:05.654 --> 35:06.787
Where is she?

35:09.891 --> 35:11.592
I don't know.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.104
Madame foreperson,

35:23.138 --> 35:25.373
how do you find
the defendant, Jack Lewis,

35:25.407 --> 35:26.874
on Count One of the Indictment,

35:26.908 --> 35:28.709
violating the Clean Water Act,

35:28.744 --> 35:30.478
guilty or not guilty?

35:34.583 --> 35:35.617
Guilty.

35:45.093 --> 35:47.495
Are we going to discover
electricity next?

35:47.529 --> 35:48.729
I know what you think.

35:48.764 --> 35:50.298
Do you? Really?

35:50.332 --> 35:52.166
I know. I'm a dinosaur.
I don't like change.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.411
I'm the mother of the Mother Court.

35:53.435 --> 35:56.971
I'm protecting all these antique
traditions and institutions.

35:57.005 --> 35:58.673
I guess you do know what I think.

35:58.707 --> 36:01.208
It's not that. I mean, that is all true.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.380
I used to take the Wheel
home every weekend.

36:06.415 --> 36:08.316
You didn't know that, did you?

36:08.350 --> 36:10.551
I'm sure it's a federal crime.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.619
It is.

36:11.653 --> 36:14.689
Larry and I couldn't decide
about a lot of things.

36:14.723 --> 36:16.724
Not big things. Little things.

36:16.758 --> 36:19.026
Where to go to dinner.
Where to go on vacation.

36:19.061 --> 36:22.196
So, I started bringing the Wheel home,

36:22.230 --> 36:25.333
and we'd write all our options
on little pieces of paper

36:25.367 --> 36:28.402
and put them in the Wheel
and the Wheel would decide.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.604
We trusted the Wheel.

36:30.639 --> 36:34.709
It got kind of addictive in our home.

36:34.743 --> 36:38.079
When Jason was deciding
where to go to college,

36:38.113 --> 36:39.180
he used the Wheel.

36:39.214 --> 36:40.255
For real!

36:40.289 --> 36:43.718
He went to Wesleyan because of the Wheel.

36:43.752 --> 36:45.753
These are bigger things.

36:47.609 --> 36:52.713
When Larry... got sick...

36:56.451 --> 37:00.587
two days before he died, he
wanted me to read him a story.

37:00.612 --> 37:04.514
He couldn't decide.

37:04.539 --> 37:07.174
So we gave it to the Wheel.

37:07.199 --> 37:11.936
And I read him
"Hound of the Baskervilles."

37:11.961 --> 37:13.461
He liked that.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.965
The Wheel was fair.

37:17.990 --> 37:23.461
It saw us through a lot of joy
and excruciating sadness.

37:23.486 --> 37:27.429
I could... take it home, Nick...

37:29.416 --> 37:31.617
but that's hard now.

37:34.482 --> 37:36.050
It belongs here.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.917
Hey.

37:49.951 --> 37:51.752
What are you still doing here?

37:51.787 --> 37:53.654
I got a trial in the morning.

37:55.457 --> 37:58.325
I'm gonna grab something to eat.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.460
If you...?

38:01.029 --> 38:02.863
I think I might be out for this one.

38:02.898 --> 38:05.599
I'm gonna finish up here
and then I got a thing later.

38:05.634 --> 38:07.768
A thing? With a girl?

38:07.803 --> 38:08.837
Hopefully.

38:08.872 --> 38:11.672
Okay, well, if you change your mind,

38:11.706 --> 38:15.876
I'll probably be watching
"Charade" in my pajamas.

38:15.911 --> 38:17.511
I'd expect no less.

38:18.914 --> 38:20.815
Good night, Kate.

38:20.849 --> 38:22.249
Good night.

38:32.761 --> 38:34.795
Jack Lewis is going to jail.

38:34.830 --> 38:36.697
KapplerHays agreed to
triple the health fund

38:36.731 --> 38:38.666
to $150 million.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.867
This is a day.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.135
You should go home. Celebrate.

38:41.169 --> 38:42.369
I'm good.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.974
I didn't think you could pull it off.

38:47.008 --> 38:48.709
I know you didn't.

38:50.846 --> 38:54.815
I never watched "Rocky." Not interested.

38:54.850 --> 38:57.685
Because I don't want to
just "go the distance."

38:58.086 --> 39:01.222
I like "Rocky IV"

39:01.256 --> 39:05.326
because he wins
against a roidedup commie.

39:10.131 --> 39:13.033
Whoever you are,
I prefer you to Seth Oliver.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.846
Hey.

39:25.881 --> 39:26.947
Hey.

39:26.982 --> 39:28.883
I won.

39:28.917 --> 39:31.018
What is this?

39:31.052 --> 39:32.353
I wanted to say thank you.

39:34.089 --> 39:35.289
Okay, Seth. Great.

39:35.323 --> 39:38.025
And also apologize.

39:40.395 --> 39:42.062
I left.

39:42.097 --> 39:44.698
It was hard, but it was
the right thing to do.

39:47.768 --> 39:48.836
I can't have it both ways.

39:48.870 --> 39:51.205
I can't leave you and then lean on you.

39:52.073 --> 39:55.075
It's not fair. It's wrong.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.381
It's not good for either of us.

40:00.415 --> 40:04.618
No matter how...
right it feels in the moment.

40:18.300 --> 40:21.802
Again... I underestimated you.

40:32.981 --> 40:36.283
And you promise you'll call me
if you need anything?

40:36.318 --> 40:38.452
Yes. Thank you.

40:40.722 --> 40:42.523
Jill?

40:42.557 --> 40:45.659
Um... you said you'd call my son?

40:47.495 --> 40:50.222
I wasn't able to reach him.

40:51.700 --> 40:55.102
But I'll keep trying. I promise.
