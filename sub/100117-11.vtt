WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.134
Sam: Not everything we did
was because of Chuck.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.396
It was us --

00:05.440 --> 00:07.181
the blood, the sweat,
the tears.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.834
That's us.

00:08.878 --> 00:12.664
There's no way that Chuck
lets us die like this.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.492
Chuck: Hi, Sam.
You're weak.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.146
We're connected
by these wounds.

00:16.190 --> 00:19.497
But all good things
must come to an end.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.022
You cannot
change my mind.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.023
God lied to me.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.154
Michael: I will help you.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.503
To bind
the spell together,

00:25.547 --> 00:26.722
the nectar from
a Leviathan blossom

00:26.765 --> 00:28.202
that only grows
in one place.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.507
Purgatory.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.508
Dean: Sam, smash it.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.858
Now!

00:32.902 --> 00:34.947
I can't.
I'm sorry. I...

00:34.991 --> 00:37.254
Sammy lost hope,
and now I'm free.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.777
Grigori.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.431
They were some of
the first angels on Earth.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.781
Sam: And they've been hunting
humans, feeding off them.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.087
It's time.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.871
-Being normal...
-Is fine.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.786
But you and me? There's zero
about our lives that's normal.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.179
If we don't fix this,

00:49.223 --> 00:50.920
we might kill each other
by accident.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.182

Yeah. Right. Sorry.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.540
And how's Eileen doing?

03:56.584 --> 03:57.802
She's hanging in there.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.282
She thinks our plan

03:59.326 --> 04:02.285
sounds a little too good
to be true.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.721
You know,
maybe she's right.

04:03.765 --> 04:07.072
I mean, how long have we been
on the road

04:07.116 --> 04:08.944
looking for some place
Garth says

04:08.987 --> 04:10.989
will supercharge our luck,
maybe?

04:11.033 --> 04:12.817
And I mean, luck?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.429
Is that really even gonna fix
our whole "problem"?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.561
Well, it couldn't hurt.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.433
And I don't know how much more
of this "normal life" crap

04:19.476 --> 04:21.304
I can take,
between the credit cards,

04:21.348 --> 04:24.916
the car trouble,
the constant freaking heartburn.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.744
Well, you know,
if you changed your diet...

04:26.788 --> 04:28.093
You...
All I'm saying

04:28.137 --> 04:29.921
is that this place --

04:29.965 --> 04:31.749
it's not even
in the lore.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.970
Other than Garth,
no one's ever even heard of it.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.624
No, it's there.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.975
It's gotta be.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.411
I mean, Chuck didn't do this
to us

04:41.455 --> 04:44.284
just to teach us
some messed-up lesson.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.938
You know,
he wants us off our game.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.853
He wants us weak.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.812
'Cause he's coming for us,
Sammy.

04:52.335 --> 04:56.121
And when he does,
if we haven't figured this out,

04:56.165 --> 04:57.775
we're DOA.

05:14.836 --> 05:15.880
Hello?

05:18.492 --> 05:20.624
Uh, yeah, uh, uh,
Jeb Evans,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.800
Sheriff's Department,
Cushing, Oklahoma.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.499
Uh, uh, I'm looking
for an FBI Agent Watts?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.196
Um, yeah,

05:27.239 --> 05:30.155
Agent Watts is working a case
in, uh, Alaska.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.462
This is Agent, uh, Lizzo.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.681
Hmm.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.160
Well, I guess a fed's a fed,
right?

05:38.425 --> 05:40.557
Listen, we got a homicide
down here,

05:40.601 --> 05:43.038
and my file says
that our suspect

05:43.081 --> 05:45.083
might be one of yours.

05:45.127 --> 05:48.086
The murderer is someone
we're looking for?

05:48.130 --> 05:51.568
It says Agent Watts started
a file on him last spring

05:51.612 --> 05:53.875
and to call
with any information

05:53.918 --> 05:57.052
regarding
a, uh, Jack Kline?

06:00.272 --> 06:01.361
Jack.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.058
That name ring
a bell?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.454
Yeah.

06:13.547 --> 06:16.114
Hey.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.594
Hey.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.381
What are we doing?
Why did we stop?

06:21.424 --> 06:24.427
Last call on food
for the next few hundred miles.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.211
Grab something
out of the cooler.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.083
Oh, yeah, no, I polished off
the last of the sandwiches

06:28.126 --> 06:30.215
while you were out.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.870
We're on a budget.

06:34.132 --> 06:37.701
What can we get
for, uh, $4.60?

06:37.745 --> 06:41.401
Um, a slice of pie
and a cup of coffee?

06:41.444 --> 06:42.445
Of course.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.620
Two forks?

06:46.144 --> 06:48.103
Damn it, I was hoping
for a cheeseburger.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.626
You can't even digest cheese
anymore.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.280
Dude. Lactaid.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.239
Alright.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.417
So, if Garth is right,

06:57.460 --> 06:59.767
we take this road,
but, honestly,

06:59.810 --> 07:03.118
it doesn't look like
there's anything up there.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.554
Hey, how long have you
lived here?

07:04.598 --> 07:05.642
All my life.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.296
Great.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.559
Can you tell us
what is up that road?

07:09.603 --> 07:10.821
No.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.344
Are you for real?

07:12.388 --> 07:13.737
Did Candy put you up
to this?

07:13.781 --> 07:14.999
No,
nobody put us up to this.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.566
We're -- We're just headed
that way

07:16.610 --> 07:17.915
and wanted to know
if there's anything up there.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.351
Um, forget it.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.483
Sounds nuts.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.180
Nuts is good.
Yeah.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.444
A couple of
Mister Freakin' Peanuts here.

07:28.317 --> 07:31.015
Okay. There's -- There's
kind of this, um, urban legend

07:31.059 --> 07:33.496
around here,
about this place

07:33.540 --> 07:34.454
in the middle
of nowhere.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.804
It's a-a pool hall

07:36.847 --> 07:40.329
that is...magic?

07:40.372 --> 07:42.200
Magic pool hall?

07:42.244 --> 07:43.985
I told ya.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.030
They say that if you get
up there and you win,

07:46.074 --> 07:47.336
then you come back lucky.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.381
Like,
hit the Powerball lucky.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.992
Sounds good to me.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.342
Except for no one
ever does.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.952
What do you mean?

07:54.996 --> 07:59.130
Um, one of our regulars,
Leonard.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.305
The bank was coming
for his house,

08:00.349 --> 08:01.959
so he went out
to find the place

08:02.003 --> 08:05.702
and he never came back.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.313
Heard he had
some sort of accident.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.100
Excuse me.
Yeah.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.496
Okay.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.628
I guess now we know
what the downside is.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.804
Eh, not from
where I'm sitting.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.720
A-A pool hall that makes you
lucky or might kill you?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.635
I mean, it sounds like a demon
or a witch or...

08:25.679 --> 08:27.724
Or it could be awesome.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.901
It's pool. The -- The --
The game of champions, kings.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.555
My game.
Hell, our game.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
How many honest-to-goodness
great memories

08:34.775 --> 08:35.906
do we have
hustling pool?

08:35.950 --> 08:37.168
Yeah,
because we had to.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.735
To eat.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.432
Okay, well, my point is,

08:40.476 --> 08:42.565
is that if pool is the way
that we get our mojo back,

08:42.609 --> 08:45.568
then maybe we ain't as screwed
as we thought.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.092
Hey, you guys drive
an Impala?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
I, uh, think you have
a flat.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.102
Sheriff Evans: Okay, you got
the video, right?

08:58.146 --> 08:59.408
Uh, yes.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.019
Okay, so, so,
vic was a local doctor,

09:02.063 --> 09:03.717
and the office security cameras
gave us

09:03.760 --> 09:05.196
a good idea
of what went down.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.415
Just an idea?

09:06.458 --> 09:07.677
Y-You'll see.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.418
Now, Dr. Sariel was
a good man.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.768
He delivered
both of my kids.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.378
Jack.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.555
This thing's got people
pretty spooked.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.960
I don't understand.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.485
Me, neither. Signal goes out
for about 2 1/2 minutes,

09:33.529 --> 09:38.142
during which time, the suspect
kills the doc in his office.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.274
Why?

09:39.317 --> 09:41.058
Keep watching.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.283
Is that...?

09:51.982 --> 09:53.636
That's his heart.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.444
Dean: Relax.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.316
We might actually have
some fun.

10:23.797 --> 10:24.841
Sam: Right.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.938
Dean, we don't even have
beer money,

10:34.982 --> 10:36.853
much less whatever
the buy-in is here.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.073
Hey,
we'll figure something out.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.118
Get you something?

10:41.162 --> 10:42.554
-Yeah.

10:42.598 --> 10:45.035
Two waters, por favor.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.824
Hey, uh...

10:50.867 --> 10:53.000
Evie.
Evie.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.306
Say, listen, if, uh,
me and my brother here

10:55.350 --> 10:56.786
wanted to get ourselves
a game...?

10:58.919 --> 11:00.790
Pax.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
Two more for ya.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.882
Hey, you remember a guy
who was in here a few weeks ago?

11:05.926 --> 11:08.145
Uh, name was Leonard?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.191
No. Sorry.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.673
Follow me.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.196
Oh.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.809
So, how'd you guys
find us?

11:19.853 --> 11:21.593
Uh, a friend.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.987
Did your, uh, friend say
how we wager?

11:24.031 --> 11:26.686
Yeah, listen, uh, money's
a little tight right now.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.470
Yeah,
we don't bet with money.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.607
We use this.

11:39.611 --> 11:43.050
Okay.
What are we looking at?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.095
Go ahead.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.097
Touch it.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.763
Not great.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.547
Not the worst, either.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.766
And that means...?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.028
Well, you see, everybody
walks in here

12:05.072 --> 12:07.596
with a certain amount
of luck.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.772
That glow --

12:09.816 --> 12:12.122
that's you.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.299
About average.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.040
Yeah,
that sounds about right.

12:17.084 --> 12:21.262
But you set that coin on --
on that table,

12:21.305 --> 12:22.872
you get yourself a game.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
And you win?

12:24.831 --> 12:27.094
You just might see
your fortune improve.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.444
And if he loses?

12:29.487 --> 12:31.446
Play again.
Have a good time.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.230
You know, keep playing.

12:33.274 --> 12:38.932
But if the coin goes blank,
that means you're out of luck.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.499
You gotta leave.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.500
Questions?

12:42.544 --> 12:43.588
Yeah.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.416
What is this place?

12:45.460 --> 12:46.766
Who owns it?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.202
I just work here.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.771
Look, if you don't like it,

12:51.814 --> 12:55.296
uh, the door's open.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.254
When I win,

12:57.298 --> 12:59.779
can I split it?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.128
The luck?

13:01.171 --> 13:02.259
It's yours.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.608
You do what you want.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.827
Yeah.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.221
Uh, just give us a second.
Thanks.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.268
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
No way.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.792
Man, I've been
slinging pool cues

13:12.835 --> 13:14.271
since before you were born.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.664
What? When you were 4?
Really?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.492
What, between nap time
and snack?

13:17.535 --> 13:20.103
Look, we barely made it out of
that monster fight club, okay?

13:20.147 --> 13:22.671
We need this.
And you know it.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.021
Now, look, you're better than me
at pretty much everything, okay?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.936
That's okay.
I'm not mad.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.460
I'm proud.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.811
But I can wipe the floor
with you when it comes to pool.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.818
Good. Alright.

13:38.861 --> 13:42.038
Okay, pal,
let's give it a go.

14:24.559 --> 14:25.908
I'm a Grigori.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.780
Each of our names
inscribed on our swords.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.914
A brotherhood of perfectly
crafted beings.

14:50.063 --> 14:53.196
So, how long are we supposed
to just wait around?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.069
You know,
if the fish aren't biting,

14:56.112 --> 14:57.374
throw 'em a little chum.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.948
I don't know, Sammy.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.384
I'm a little rusty.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.447
Go on. Rack 'er up.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.449
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.670
Decide not to play?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.673
Uh, yeah.
It's not really my thing.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.240
-Hmm.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.949
So, what's her deal?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.776
Who? Moira?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.778
Been here a while.

15:53.822 --> 15:57.608
Guess her sister's
still in a coma.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.785
So, she's playing
to wake her up?

16:00.829 --> 16:04.180
Everybody wants something.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.877
Yeah.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.014
Hey, do you ever smell
anything weird,

16:12.058 --> 16:13.973
like rotten eggs,
or...?

16:14.016 --> 16:16.976
Just Charlie.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.499
Right.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.022
What about --

16:20.066 --> 16:23.678
Have you ever noticed
little bundles laying around?

16:23.721 --> 16:25.810
Uh...no.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.899
Look, you're new.

16:27.943 --> 16:32.643
I get it. You're trying
to figure this out.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.124
I guess
it is pretty unbelievable.

16:35.168 --> 16:39.128
Places like this don't exist
for no reason.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.827
Most people think
it's a Godsend.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.873
Take that guy.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.703
Loves his wife,
but she has expensive taste.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.487
He came here
from Atlantic City,

16:50.531 --> 16:52.837
not a dime left
to his name.

16:52.881 --> 16:57.320
Or her --
Three kids, works doubles,

16:57.364 --> 16:59.496
buys a scratcher
every night.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.064
They both deserve
a lucky break.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.414
And they almost got one.

17:04.458 --> 17:08.027
They went on a streak,
could have walked away winners,

17:08.070 --> 17:10.855
but they kept on playing
till their luck went sour.

17:10.899 --> 17:13.684
They're not
actually winning?

17:13.728 --> 17:15.599
Not anymore.

17:15.643 --> 17:19.516
Like I said,
they should have walked away.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.544
Damn it.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.657
Why are you
following me?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.268
It felt like a warning,
like --

18:15.311 --> 18:16.921
like she was telling me
to cut our losses.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.967
Come on, man.
I'm on a roll.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.490
Dean, you won one game.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.927
Listen, I think this place
sucks you in, right?

18:22.971 --> 18:24.277
And if you keep playing,
you'll lose.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.626
And if you keep losing...

18:25.669 --> 18:27.236
You go all Leonard.
Exactly.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.020
Alright, so, we need
to minimize our risk

18:29.064 --> 18:31.501
and maximize our profit,
right?

18:31.545 --> 18:34.243
It's kind of like that action
we took back in Tallahassee.

18:34.287 --> 18:38.117
Remember that?
The -- The -- The "Fast Eddie"?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.422
I don't remember.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.424
It was Dad's favorite,
from the movie.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.513
Paul Newman. "The Hustler."

18:45.472 --> 18:46.429
Alright, fine.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.997
One more game. One.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.955
Okay.

18:50.999 --> 18:54.176
Now we just gotta find
our Jackie Gleason.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.672
What did you say
your name was again?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.891
Well,
my name's Dean Winchester.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.285
And I'm gonna kick
your ass.

19:19.854 --> 19:24.163
Now, what kind of name
is, uh, Joey Six?

19:24.206 --> 19:27.078
Oh, it's just something they
used to call me back in PBR.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.211
Professional
bull riding circuit.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.517
Nice.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.087
Tell me.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.655
How was that?

19:38.699 --> 19:40.483
Corner pocket.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.318
Good times.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.417
And some not so good.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.565
Double or nothing
says you miss that shot.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.266
You trying to hustle me,
Rodeo?

20:24.310 --> 20:26.877
I thought you were gonna kick
my ass.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.141
Alright.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.760
Helluva shot.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.015
Hey.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.800
Good game.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.413
Guess you can hustle
a hustler.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.285
Yeah,
I guess you can.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.343
Stay back.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.436
Damn it.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.351
Let an old man go die in peace,
huh?

21:49.395 --> 21:51.310
Wait, you're dying?

21:51.353 --> 21:53.137
Cancer.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.009
I came out here
to beat it.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.578
I did win me
an extra year.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.799
Been saving this.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.211
Yeah, I liked that leathery
son of a bitch.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.386
Yeah, when he bet
double or nothing,

22:24.430 --> 22:25.518
you cleaned him out.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.346
Okay, well, plan worked.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.347
Let's hit the road.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.652
What about everybody else?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.088
Just give me some time,
alright?

22:31.132 --> 22:32.394
I-I need
to figure this out.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.004
Dude, we're in a fight with God,
okay?

22:34.048 --> 22:36.746
And...we just got
our mojo back.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.705
You really think
there's enough luck in that coin

22:38.748 --> 22:41.229
to make up
for whatever Chuck took from us?

22:41.272 --> 22:43.666
Why don't I give it
a whirl?
How?

22:43.710 --> 22:45.712
I'll go for a quick drive.
If Baby treats me right,

22:45.755 --> 22:46.887
then I know
we're out of the woods.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.671
But when I get back,
it's adiós.

22:59.073 --> 23:02.685
Oh, uh,
Agent Liz-- Lizzo.

23:02.729 --> 23:03.730
Evans.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.688
Hi.
Glad you came.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.037
Glad you called.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.257
So, local transient
spotted our boy

23:09.300 --> 23:10.737
in some sort
of an altercation.

23:10.780 --> 23:11.912
Did they say
with whom?

23:11.955 --> 23:13.261
No.
She ran the other way

23:13.304 --> 23:16.307
when she saw the other guy
had a...sword.

23:16.351 --> 23:17.918
Looks like he used it.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.224
Are there any abandoned
buildings in town?

23:20.268 --> 23:21.312
Yeah, I-I guess.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.140
I mean, there's, uh,

23:23.184 --> 23:24.881
plenty
of old cattle barns,

23:24.925 --> 23:27.710
empty warehouses, old church,
that kind of thing.

23:27.754 --> 23:28.972
Church.
Where's the church?

23:29.016 --> 23:31.975
Uh, two blocks down
on your right.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.890
Thank you.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.719
Uh, agent?

23:36.763 --> 23:38.547
I called you
for answers.

23:38.591 --> 23:39.635
I know.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.985
And I intend
to find them.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.727
And then the Vikes
finally win the Super Bowl.

23:44.771 --> 23:45.902
Right, that's great.
It is.

23:45.946 --> 23:49.558
But is it really worth
your life?

23:49.602 --> 23:53.344
Look, man, just --
just one more game.

23:54.607 --> 23:57.261
Evie: Nice try.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.568
Too bad
no one will listen.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.396
None of us
are going anywhere.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.793
Are they trapped here?

24:06.836 --> 24:08.447
Are you?

24:08.490 --> 24:12.973
Well, car's dead. Again.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.278
Didn't even make it
out of the parking lot.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.671
This coin
blows.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.020
I think you're right.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.587
Didn't have enough juice.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.024
Hold on.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.286
No way.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.463
Hmm?

24:24.506 --> 24:25.855
At first, I thought maybe
these coins were --

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
were hexed or cursed.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.163
Like the rabbit's foot.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.599
When you win, you're --
you're taking luck

24:30.643 --> 24:32.122
from whoever you beat,
right?

24:32.166 --> 24:34.603
Right.
But Joey Six beat
how many people?

24:34.647 --> 24:36.779
30? 40? More?

24:36.823 --> 24:39.608
All of that accumulated luck
should have been passed to you.

24:39.652 --> 24:40.609
Well, tell that to Baby.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.045
Exactly. It didn't.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.613
Because what if
someone's stealing,

24:44.657 --> 24:46.702
every game,
skimming luck off the top?

24:46.746 --> 24:47.964
What -- What do you mean?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.139
Like, the house?

24:49.183 --> 24:51.402
Her. I think.

24:54.884 --> 24:58.148
"Atrox Fortuna"?

24:58.192 --> 25:00.499
She's the Roman Goddess
of Luck.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.501
Okay, say you're right.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.980
What do we do?

25:04.024 --> 25:05.155
I-I can't help you.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.505
I'm sorry.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.810
Then why warn me
in the first place?

25:07.854 --> 25:09.812
So you'd take your brother
and go.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.335
Wait,
why are you here?

25:11.379 --> 25:13.163
Does she have something
over you?

25:13.207 --> 25:14.251
I came to play.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.557
I lost.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.907
I'm only alive
'cause she lets me stay.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.343
Long as I keep working.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.736
So, if you don't play yourself
to death,

25:20.780 --> 25:23.173
you work yourself to death.
Is that it?

25:23.217 --> 25:24.348
Yeah, that's it.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.872
Is she here?

25:25.915 --> 25:27.090
I don't know.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.223
I only talk to Pax.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.619
Her son.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.410
Kabaiel:
You should heal that.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.724
I know what you are.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.247
You're powerful.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.949
Why not use it?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.951
Fight back?

26:08.262 --> 26:11.395
As a soldier,
I respect your silence,

26:11.439 --> 26:14.224
tactically misguided
as it may be.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.749
For example,

26:16.792 --> 26:21.405
when I ask
why are you killing my kind,

26:21.449 --> 26:23.712
you should answer

26:23.756 --> 26:25.801
so I won't hurt you.

26:35.768 --> 26:38.945
Why did you kill them?

26:38.988 --> 26:43.166
We Grigori have our own
frequency of angel radio.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.778
Did you know that?

26:45.821 --> 26:48.650
Before he died,
my brother called to me.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.260
Did you want him to?

26:50.304 --> 26:52.785
To draw me out?

26:52.828 --> 26:55.309
Kill me, too?

26:59.052 --> 27:00.619
Sam: Pax.

27:00.662 --> 27:03.622
Hey, uh, can I ask you
a question?

27:05.798 --> 27:08.670
Where's your mom?

27:08.714 --> 27:11.281
Fortuna!

27:11.325 --> 27:13.153
We have your son.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.335
Enough.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.687
Fortuna?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.384
That's one of my names.

27:27.428 --> 27:30.649
We know you're skimming luck
off what we won.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.128
We want it back.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.130
Or I kill him.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.479
Well, you probably could.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.568
His daddy was human.
But, no.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.222
Mom.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.963
I'm sorry, baby.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.835
I can always make
more sons.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.711
Then play me for it.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.147
I played you already.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.671
Then we go again.

27:52.714 --> 27:56.152
When I play someone,
I get a read on them.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.502
And you --

27:58.546 --> 28:00.591
you're just a beach read.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.028
Sexy, mm,

28:02.071 --> 28:03.551
but skimmable.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.162
Beach read?

28:06.206 --> 28:07.729
Lady, I'm Tolstoy.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.080
That's very funny.

28:11.124 --> 28:15.389
This one here --
He could be interesting.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.173
Wait. No, no, no.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.045
That's -- Unh-unh.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.874
Fine.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.397
Yeah, I'll play.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.532
But not for our luck.

28:28.576 --> 28:33.363
I'll play for the lives
of everybody in here.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.843
No.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.105
Only for your luck.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.499
And if you lose,
I get your lives.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.851
Come on,
you threatened my baby,

28:42.895 --> 28:44.592
my livelihood.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.768
An example must be made.

28:46.812 --> 28:50.380
So  are you in?

29:03.829 --> 29:05.482
You can't kill me.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.484
I can make you suffer.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.791
You killed
the last of my kind.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.967
You ate their hearts!

29:13.926 --> 29:17.581
This is more than fair.

29:17.625 --> 29:21.107
Fair?

29:21.150 --> 29:27.243
The last one I killed
was pretending to be a doctor.

29:30.464 --> 29:37.079
Feeding on the souls of humans
he was supposed to heal.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.125
You do it, too.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.302
Only you like children.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.926
Who told you that?

29:57.970 --> 29:59.275
Death.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.827
Jack?

30:58.247 --> 31:00.510
Guess that makes me
solids.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.749
So, why do you need this luck
so bad?

31:21.792 --> 31:23.707
Girlfriend problems?

31:23.751 --> 31:25.405
Liver failure?

31:28.408 --> 31:31.280
Accursed by God.

31:32.586 --> 31:36.024
Life's a bitch,
then you die.

31:36.068 --> 31:39.375
The God...literally
cursed us.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.550
You've met?

31:40.594 --> 31:41.943
Yeah.

31:41.987 --> 31:45.033
Little guy,
squirrelly as hell.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.817
Yeah, that's him.

31:49.777 --> 31:53.737
Well
welcome to the club.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.217
The club?

31:59.134 --> 32:01.223
Yes, the club.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.572
God created the world,

32:02.616 --> 32:04.792
but you know
who created us gods?

32:04.835 --> 32:08.665
You did. You humans.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.493
Sort of.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.238
When you apes first climbed down
from the trees,

32:16.282 --> 32:18.501
you didn't pray to him.
You prayed to the --

32:18.545 --> 32:23.158
the sun, the womb, the rain,
and the stars.

32:23.202 --> 32:27.249
Well, at first,
the creator was furious.

32:27.293 --> 32:31.427
How dare you not recognize
his beneficence?

32:34.517 --> 32:37.607
But soon enough,
he birthed us --

32:37.651 --> 32:42.786
Ra, Anu, Hera, Mixcoatl,

32:42.830 --> 32:44.136
all the rest.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.529
Why?

32:46.573 --> 32:47.617
Why?

32:49.184 --> 32:52.100
Why?

32:54.929 --> 32:56.452
To take the blame.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.714
Bad harvest?

32:57.758 --> 32:59.151
Stillborn child?

32:59.194 --> 33:02.284
Our bad. Not his.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.286
Plus, we made
for epic stories.

33:04.330 --> 33:07.637
But his ego could only
handle that for so long.

33:07.681 --> 33:11.728
Now he's happy
to hide behind whatever religion

33:11.772 --> 33:13.992
has the best
syndication deal.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.690
While we survive on scraps
in the wilderness.

33:19.780 --> 33:23.044
Most gods,
they're forgotten.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.003
But I'm old.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.482
I hold a grudge.

33:34.708 --> 33:35.709
Oh, well.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.754
What are you gonna do?

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
We're gonna fight him.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.845
Are you, now?!

33:41.889 --> 33:43.151
And when you lose...?

33:43.195 --> 33:46.024
Sam: We lose swinging.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.504
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

34:02.823 --> 34:03.867
You little minx.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.348
You got me talking.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.394
You're good.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.048
I learned
from my brother.

34:10.091 --> 34:13.051
Alright,
you know the deal.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.402
Even up.

34:16.445 --> 34:19.100
What do you say
we make it interesting?

34:19.144 --> 34:21.450
Okay?
You're gonna fight God.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.192
That's the stuff of heroes,
right?

34:24.236 --> 34:27.065
So, you're gonna need
the luck of heroes --

34:27.108 --> 34:29.937
Hercules, Cuchulain,
Gilgamesh.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.112
I helped them all.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.940
I can help you, too.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.203
What's the catch?

34:35.247 --> 34:37.379
Another game.
Double or nothing.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.946
Double.

34:38.989 --> 34:42.210
That's how
the cowboy died.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.733
Mm-hmm.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.570
Yeah.

34:54.614 --> 34:55.963
Deal.

34:57.834 --> 35:01.142
But not for more luck.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.796
For them.

35:02.839 --> 35:04.580
If I win,

35:04.624 --> 35:06.321
you have to let them go.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.497
Honey,
I'm not stopping them.

35:08.541 --> 35:11.326
Okay, then whenI win,

35:11.370 --> 35:14.112
you have to give back
the luck you stole.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.243
Close up shop.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.853
What is with you
and these loser?

35:16.897 --> 35:18.246
They're nothing!

35:18.290 --> 35:20.118
They don't matter.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.342
They matter to me.

35:27.386 --> 35:28.952
They matter to us.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.266
Well, fine.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.007
Rack 'em up.

36:26.749 --> 36:29.056
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

36:51.078 --> 36:54.212
You challenged
the Goddess of Luck
in her own joint.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.736
What did you think
was gonna happen?

36:56.779 --> 36:58.694
Well, we had to try.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.740
Well, that was stupid.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.452
Thought
she was gonna kill us.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.282
Yeah,
she doesn't have to.

37:21.326 --> 37:24.285
Our luck will do that
on its own.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.982
Dean,
we can't just --

37:26.026 --> 37:29.290
Just leave them.
No. I know.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.987
Alright, well,
let's go find some Wi-Fi

37:31.031 --> 37:32.598
and see
what kills Lady Luck.

37:32.641 --> 37:33.729
Then we'll circle back.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.389
Hey.
What -- What's going on?

37:41.433 --> 37:43.304
What happened?
-She...

37:43.348 --> 37:45.132
She shut it down.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.786
What?!
Why?

37:46.829 --> 37:48.440
Because of you.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.399
She said she thought your kind
had gone extinct.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.096
Our kind?

37:53.140 --> 37:54.924
Heroes.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.100
Like the old days.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.407
And, uh,
she gave me a message.

37:59.451 --> 38:02.280
She said,
"Don't play his game.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.325
Make him play yours."

38:42.058 --> 38:43.364
Come on.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.855
Ohh!

38:55.898 --> 38:57.857
We're back, baby!

39:07.519 --> 39:10.086
Alright, this is it.
Last scratcher.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.653
Come on, come on.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.918
What the hell?!

39:15.962 --> 39:19.357
I mean, so much for
that "Luck of Hercules" crap.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.359
So, we didn't win
the lottery.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.708
But no car trouble.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.492
Uh, credit cards work.

39:24.536 --> 39:27.016
Oh, and back-to-back
bacon double cheeseburgers

39:27.060 --> 39:28.366
didn't kill you, so...

39:28.409 --> 39:29.845
That was beautiful,
by the way.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.020
I'm just saying
would it have killed her

39:31.064 --> 39:32.587
to give us
a little extra?

39:32.631 --> 39:34.502
Well, she thinks
we're real heroes.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.025
Maybe they don't get
all the shortcuts.

39:36.069 --> 39:39.681
Friggin' gods, man.

39:39.725 --> 39:40.900
Cass?

39:40.943 --> 39:42.205
Hey.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.729
Everything okay?

39:49.735 --> 39:51.954
Hello.

39:51.998 --> 39:55.262
Jack?

39:55.305 --> 39:57.917
It's really him.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.552
Sam: Jack, you --
you ate their hearts?

40:24.596 --> 40:26.685
I...had to.

40:29.383 --> 40:33.082
And you let him?

40:33.126 --> 40:34.344
Hmm.

40:34.388 --> 40:37.435
You could have called us.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.439
Every day I wanted to come home,
but...

40:41.482 --> 40:42.918
I couldn't.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.354
Why not?

40:44.398 --> 40:46.574
Because if I don't
stay hidden,

40:46.618 --> 40:48.663
if I use my powers,
my grandfather --

40:48.707 --> 40:50.186
he'll know I'm back,

40:50.230 --> 40:53.102
and he'll try
and kill me...

40:53.146 --> 40:56.584
again.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.194
He's afraid of me.

41:01.154 --> 41:04.157
And that's why
we had to wait.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.640
Billie kept him hidden
in the Empty

41:08.683 --> 41:10.685
until Chuck
went off world.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.818
She let me out
when it was safe.

41:12.861 --> 41:15.037
Safe to what?
Eat a bunch of angel hearts?

41:15.081 --> 41:18.171
Safe to do
what I have to.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.956
The hearts,
they were just the beginning.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.829
They made me strong,
but I-I'm not strong enough.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.135
I...

41:26.179 --> 41:28.137
If I do
exactly what she says,

41:28.181 --> 41:30.662
if I follow her plan,

41:30.705 --> 41:32.968
then I'll get stronger

41:33.012 --> 41:34.230
and...

41:36.842 --> 41:39.148
I'll be able
to kill God.
