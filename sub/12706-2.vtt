WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:04.003
WILLOW:
 Isn't college cool?

00:04.038 --> 00:05.639
BUFFY:
 Just haven't had
 a whole lot of time

00:05.673 --> 00:08.676
to think about life
 at U.C. Sunnydale.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.478
Wow.
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:11.512 --> 00:13.881
Have you met
your roommate yet?
No.

00:13.913 --> 00:15.182
Oh, hi.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.417
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.353
KATHY:
 Kathy. I just know
 that this whole year

00:19.387 --> 00:21.254
is gonna be super fun.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.657
Oh! Oh! Uh...
(grunts)

00:23.690 --> 00:25.925
I'm sorry. I've forgotten my
manners in all the concussion.

00:25.958 --> 00:28.329
I'm Riley. Are you girls
taking Intro Psych or...

00:28.361 --> 00:31.265
You've taken it?
I'm a T.A. I'll be helping
the professor out.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.899
I'm Professor Walsh.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.502
Those of you who fall
into my good graces

00:34.534 --> 00:36.003
will come to know me as Maggie.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.537
Those of you who don't,

00:37.570 --> 00:39.506
will come to know me
by the name my T.A.s use

00:39.539 --> 00:41.040
and think I don't know about:

00:41.075 --> 00:43.110
The Evil Bitch Monster of Death.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.878
Officially, you no longer
have a watcher.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.414
Buffy, you know I'll always
be here when you need me.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.948
You are gonna have
to take care of yourself.

00:48.981 --> 00:50.718
(grunting)

00:54.054 --> 00:57.290
So, college not so scary
after all, huh?

00:57.325 --> 00:59.393
It's turning out to be
a lot like high school,

00:59.426 --> 01:01.862
which I can handle.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.063
At least I know what to expect.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.141
* Do you believe
in life after love *

01:13.174 --> 01:15.442
Wow, this music
is so...

01:15.475 --> 01:17.578
so...
I know.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.780
This song is super fun,
isn't it?

01:19.813 --> 01:22.483
You bet. It just gets
funner and funner

01:22.515 --> 01:25.453
every time you play it.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.155
Going out?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.289
Yeah.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.259
I'm seriously
caffeine-deprived.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.295
Figured I'd head down
to The Grotto and get a jolt

01:34.328 --> 01:35.929
and, you know, do some studying.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.466
Oh, it's late.
Won't you be up all night?

01:38.498 --> 01:41.468
Oh. Yeah, but it's cool.

01:41.502 --> 01:45.272
I'm sort of an "up"
kind of night person.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.841
I mentioned that, right?
I guess I just

01:48.876 --> 01:51.278
didn't realize you'd be coming
and going at all hours.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.146
Well, not that I mind.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.248
I'm just surprised.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.450
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
I promise.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.521
Okay.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.156
Oh. Say, Buffy...

02:02.189 --> 02:05.125
I wanted to show you this
little system I implemented.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.762
Oh, goody. A system.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.364
Just log every call
you make in here.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.931
And that way,
when the bill comes,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.766
there won't be a problem.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.603
'Cause I figure
a stitch in time...

02:15.635 --> 02:17.638
Catches the worm.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.108
You bet.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.975
Okay, then.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.377
Also...

02:24.412 --> 02:27.281
I noticed that some
of my milk was missing.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.649
Did you...

02:28.681 --> 02:31.551
Oh. Yeah, actually, I
did. I-I meant to...

02:31.585 --> 02:34.187
No, it's totally okay.
I was just wondering.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.223
Yeah, I-I was making
my coffee and I just...

02:36.257 --> 02:38.526
Buffy, it's fine.
I just wanted to make sure...

02:38.558 --> 02:40.159
(music stops)

02:42.530 --> 02:44.664
(song repeats)

02:44.698 --> 02:47.468
That we didn't have
a thief or something.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.405
Like who?
Sid, the wily dairy gnome?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.640
I don't know.
It's no big deal.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.475
I mean, please, feel free.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.409
Okay.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.246
I'm really sorry.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.549
I have to...

03:01.581 --> 03:02.181
Have a good time.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.651
Yeah.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.052
You, too.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.455
With ironing.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.592
* There's no talking to you

03:12.626 --> 03:16.396
* It's so sad
that you're leaving *

03:16.430 --> 03:18.665
(indistinct conversations)

03:18.699 --> 03:21.602
So, you're having trouble
getting past Kathy?

03:21.634 --> 03:24.704
Yup. She made big
with the questions.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.105
And you thought your days

03:26.139 --> 03:28.207
of sneaking out
of your room were over.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.210
No such luck.

03:30.243 --> 03:34.014
Kathy's nice and all,
but she's-she's sort of...

03:34.046 --> 03:36.683
I don't know, like
Mini-Mom of Momdonia.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.352
(chuckles)
(rustling)

03:38.385 --> 03:40.788
Wait. Did you
just hear something?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.423
I'm chewing my gum
kind of loud.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.223
That's not it.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.793
My sneakers are squeaky.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.860
I'm looking for something
lurky here, Will.

03:47.895 --> 03:48.996
Oh.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.966
Sorry, no.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.769
Darn. I could use
a little play tonight.

03:55.802 --> 03:59.139
Listening to the best of VH1
all day sort of put me on edge.

03:59.171 --> 04:01.308
Oh, Kathy still
spinning the divas?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.711
'Cause it's the funnest.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.612
Uh, it's no big.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.881
College is a time
of change, right?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.883
I bet before too long,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.051
she'll be trip-hopping
all over the place.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.221
Yeah. And, I mean,
this whole dorm thing

04:14.253 --> 04:17.057
is just an adjustment
we need to make.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.927
You know? I mean, my roomie
is kind of challenging, too.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.630
And what are we if not
women up to a challenge?

04:23.663 --> 04:27.435
Exactly. I mean, did we not
put the "grr" in girl?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.103
Well, here's where I get off.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.639
Say hey to Oz for me.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.641
Happy hunting.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.343
Wish me monsters.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.151
(growling)

04:53.694 --> 04:57.129
(wolf howling)

04:57.163 --> 04:59.031
*

05:51.250 --> 05:53.252
(rustling)

05:54.422 --> 05:56.423
Will?

06:00.728 --> 06:03.663
(rustling)

06:03.697 --> 06:05.098
All right.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.533
Why don't you quit hiding

06:06.567 --> 06:09.470
and come out and face me
like a... thing.

06:10.903 --> 06:14.173
Hey, I caught you.

06:14.206 --> 06:16.543
Is everything okay?
Oh, everything's super.

06:16.576 --> 06:20.548
I just decided a decaf latte
sounded like heaven after all.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.718
So you're coming along.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.553
Why not? This way

06:26.586 --> 06:28.956
you don't have to walk
these spooky paths alone.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.891
Great.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.761
That's just great.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.365
This is neat, isn't it?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.033
The fresh air, the trees,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.935
the smell of...
(growling)

06:41.968 --> 06:43.235
Aah!

06:49.009 --> 06:50.310
(grunting)

07:01.353 --> 07:02.755
(rustling)

07:04.858 --> 07:06.894
What the blizzard
was that all about?

07:06.927 --> 07:10.764
Uh, he, um...
tried to take my backpack.

07:10.798 --> 07:14.233
God, what were you thinking,
taking him on like that?

07:14.266 --> 07:16.769
Oh, I... (chuckles)
I don't know.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.838
I guess I-I panicked.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.442
I mean, it's just you could've
gotten hurt or something.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.345
God, and look at my
sweater. It's ruined.

07:25.377 --> 07:28.915
Yeah. Sorry about that.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.050
Here, we'll-we'll go
get you cleaned up.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.228
(speaking demon language)

07:53.240 --> 07:55.475
Boring. Boring.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.810
Bill. Bill.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.980
(panting)

08:01.014 --> 08:02.348
(grunts)

08:03.350 --> 08:05.218
You run?

08:05.252 --> 08:06.485
And jump.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.521
And bend.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.858
And, occasionally,
frolic.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.326
Okay... And, uh,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.663
what's with
 Motorbike and Scooter magazine?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.697
Congratulations.
You've found me out.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.000
I'm a mod jogger.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.168
Okay, you're not having one of
those midlife things, are you?

08:22.201 --> 08:24.004
'Cause I'm still going
"ick" from the last time

08:24.036 --> 08:25.471
you tried to
recapture your youth.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.540
Buffy.
Sorry.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.543
Right.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.411
Demon, last night.
Made with the pummeling,

08:31.444 --> 08:32.712
but he got away.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.081
What sort of demon?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.414
Um, he had a cloak on.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.751
Glowy green eyes,
and his skin had that,

08:38.785 --> 08:41.822
like, super bad
fake rub-on tan.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.256
Translate?

08:44.290 --> 08:45.424
Orangey?

08:45.457 --> 08:48.696
Thank you. Anything else?

08:48.729 --> 08:52.099
And my roommate Kathy was there,
but she didn't see anything.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.503
You took your roommate
patrolling with you?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.337
Well, I invited
the whole dorm,

08:58.370 --> 09:02.042
but she was the only one
that could make it.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.509
I told her I was going
for coffee

09:03.543 --> 09:06.113
and she decided to tag along.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.414
Right. Well, we should
discourage her from that habit.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.517
So, from what you describe, I'm
not familiar with the creature,

09:10.549 --> 09:12.351
but I'll look into it
and give you a ring

09:12.384 --> 09:13.687
when I find something.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.389
You know, it's nice out here.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.626
Yes. I-I take my tea
out here sometimes.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.128
What are you doing today?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.296
Uh, it's a big day
for me, actually.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.597
A friend of mine
recently acquired

09:24.631 --> 09:26.533
an original
Gutenberg Demonography,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.368
and it suddenly occurs to me
that you've never once

09:28.400 --> 09:30.070
asked me what my day's
plans were, which would

09:30.102 --> 09:31.605
lead me to inquire
whether you're feeling

09:31.639 --> 09:33.440
entirely yourself.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.075
That's not true.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.110
I ask about you all the time.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.547
Okay, well, maybe the words

09:40.580 --> 09:42.048
don't actually make it
out of my mouth,

09:42.081 --> 09:43.650
but I think about it.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.552
And it's appreciated.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.287
Still doesn't explain why
you're hanging around here

09:47.320 --> 09:50.157
instead of rushing off
as usual.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.825
It's no big.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.326
I just figured
I'd hang here, you know,

09:54.360 --> 09:57.630
until my roommate goes to class.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.932
Ah, I see.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.302
I know, it's probably
just me having a bitch attack.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.605
But it's not... me.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.408
Buffy, living with
somebody is never easy.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.243
Especially for an only child...

10:10.277 --> 10:12.278
Giles, listen to me, okay?
When she sharpens her pencils,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.246
she measures them
with a ruler to make sure

10:14.280 --> 10:16.283
they're all the same size.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.118
Which is fussy, I agree.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.820
But everybody has
their idiosyncrasies.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.588
You'd do well to learn
to tolerate them.

10:22.621 --> 10:26.525
Or I'll end up an old lady
who can only live with cats?

10:26.558 --> 10:29.663
Something like that.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.130
Okay. You know what,
you're right.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.668
Take a mental pic.
This is the new Buffy--

10:34.701 --> 10:37.636
kinder, gentler,
roommate extraordinaire.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.692
*

11:25.585 --> 11:27.586
*

11:50.210 --> 11:52.211
(indistinct conversations)

12:02.956 --> 12:05.057
Ex-boyfriend or loan shark?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.096
Excuse me?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.231
The person you're hiding from?

12:12.264 --> 12:15.034
Oh. Both.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.804
Ugly breakup.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.206
I'm sorry.
I just cut you...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.041
No, stay, stay.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.741
I'll watch your back.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.716
Freshman, huh?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.418
Is it that obvious?

12:32.451 --> 12:34.321
There are signs.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.155
For instance, people who've
been around for a while

12:36.188 --> 12:38.424
know how to use
their dining hall card.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.126
It's not for food?

12:40.159 --> 12:43.129
Work it right, and you
can get three meals' worth.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.298
Which equals fewer
punch cards used annually.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.899
Ah, and more cash from dad

12:46.933 --> 12:48.467
that you get to
keep for yourself.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.971
Right. See, the goal
is to polish off

12:51.004 --> 12:53.440
as much as humanly possible
in one sitting,

12:53.472 --> 12:55.942
enough to get you through the
rest of the day, if necessary.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.778
While chipmunking items
for future consumption.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.280
Ah, got it.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.984
Excess dry goods fit nicely

13:04.017 --> 13:06.119
in a backpack or your pocket.

13:06.153 --> 13:10.023
The-the wetter items--
macaronis, your turkey loaf--

13:10.057 --> 13:13.092
then you're into Ziplocs.
It's not for beginners.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.494
I'll just take it slow.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.806
So...

13:26.840 --> 13:30.110
So, those are my... Are you...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.144
Oh, no. I have someone waiting.

13:32.178 --> 13:35.148
Otherwise, I'd... (chuckles)

13:35.182 --> 13:37.683
Uh, Parker Abrams.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.552
I'm at Kresge Hall.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.956
Buffy Summers.
Stevenson.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.959
Ok, uh, well,
I'll see you around,

13:45.993 --> 13:48.695
Buffy Summers of Stevenson.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.398
See you, Parker Abrams.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.405
Hey.

13:59.438 --> 14:03.009
Say hi to non-college guy.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.711
Not that I mind,
but don't non-college guys

14:04.744 --> 14:07.047
usually populate the non-campus?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.981
Usually. Just thought
I'd come around

14:09.015 --> 14:11.183
and check on my girls.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.351
And eat off my plate.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.886
What's the deal,
Xand?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.687
Parents not feeding you?

14:15.721 --> 14:18.490
Sure, they do. For a price.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.927
So... spill.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.264
What was that all about
with the cutie patootie?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.232
I don't know.
Nothing serious, I think.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.168
Just random adorableness.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.236
Oh, a technique I know well.

14:30.269 --> 14:34.206
Hit the girl
with your best shot, then hasta.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.408
Got to respect the drive-by.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.411
Low rejection. Fond memories.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.846
It looked like more
than that to me.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.282
He got all googly-eyed.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.052
And that's because he
got hit by the Buffinator.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.254
Now he's powerless.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.956
You think?
No question--

14:48.989 --> 14:50.822
he'll be back.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.260
So, what else
is up with the Buff?

14:54.293 --> 14:55.794
Any vamp action?

14:55.827 --> 14:57.897
No. I did get jumped by a demon

14:57.931 --> 14:59.731
of non-specific origin
last night.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.970
Yeah? Something apocalypsy?

15:03.003 --> 15:05.471
Do we need to assemble
the Scooby Gang?

15:05.504 --> 15:08.975
No, but thank you for asking.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.577
I just got way
too excited, didn't I?

15:11.610 --> 15:12.980
You just need
to get out of the basement

15:13.013 --> 15:14.114
a little more there, Xand.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.817
Hi, everybody.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.885
Squeeze in.

15:19.918 --> 15:23.289
You all know my roomie Kathy?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.491
Hi.
Hey, Kathy.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.692
Hi.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.629
Is that my sweater?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.898
Oh, I didn't think you'd mind.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.100
I mean, you got mine all muddy.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.567
I was saving you from a...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.104
Bear.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.837
Mugger.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.109
Well, it's not
a problem, is it?

15:42.142 --> 15:45.077
I mean, I figure we're
almost like sisters now,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.114
living together and everything.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.653
No, it's... it's fine.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.121
I just wished you'd asked.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.525
XANDER:
So, where you from, Kathy?

15:59.558 --> 16:01.927
Nebraska, originally.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.530
Ah, yes.
Big sky country.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.376
I mean, can you believe her?
I mean, first she acts like

16:17.409 --> 16:19.812
she has sit privileges
at my lunch table, just because

16:19.846 --> 16:22.048
some computer decided
to make us cellmates.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.116
WILLOW: I'm sure
it's not easy for her.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.053
She's not like you.
She doesn't know anybody here.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.389
Fine, but what about my sweater?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.957
You can't believe the stuff
that I have to put up with.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.461
(people talking,
loud music playing)
Yeah, I guess it's hard.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.828
Uh, but I'm sure the sweater
thing was an accident.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.498
Sorry!
BUFFY: I don't know, Will.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.067
I don't think I can
take another day of this.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.235
I think she's coming back
from the bathroom.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.669
I'll call you back.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.509
Don't forget to log those calls.

17:01.019 --> 17:03.190
(squeaking)

17:14.233 --> 17:16.702
*

17:35.887 --> 17:37.589
Ew!

17:37.624 --> 17:38.891
Who left
their gum here?

17:40.759 --> 17:42.729
Gum gnome?

17:42.761 --> 17:45.498
It wasn't me.
It had to be somebody, Buffy.

17:46.898 --> 17:49.269
I don't know.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.529
Do you always make
that noise when you sleep?

18:25.204 --> 18:28.508
So then, after the scorpion,
the demon opened my mouth

18:28.540 --> 18:31.743
and sucked some kind of
weird light out of me.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.447
And the worst part? I wake up,
and there's Kathy staring at me

18:34.480 --> 18:36.316
like I'm some kind of freak.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.018
Well, actually, the worst part--
I'd have to go with the demon

18:39.050 --> 18:40.752
pouring the blood
down your throat.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.655
Me, too. I would
vote for that, too.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.259
But that's just a dream,
and this Kathy thing is real.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.859
I mean, all she
cared about was that

18:47.894 --> 18:49.961
her precious sleep
had been disturbed.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.432
Perhaps it would
be more productive

18:52.464 --> 18:54.166
to examine your dreams.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.969
Um, to determine
their meaning.

18:57.002 --> 19:00.707
You can read dreams?
That's neat.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.609
Giles, Kathy.
Kathy, Giles.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.111
WILLOW:
He's our grown-up friend.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.446
N-not in a creepy way.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.382
Nice to meet you, Kathy.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.982
Ditto.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.619
Maybe you can read
the dream I had last night.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.121
There was, like,
this monster,

19:15.153 --> 19:17.190
and he sat on me and did
all this stuff to me.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.891
Stuff like scorpions

19:18.924 --> 19:20.859
and Bloody Mary, minus the Mary?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.028
That's it. How'd you know?

19:22.060 --> 19:23.663
Well, I'm a good guesser.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.031
Me, too. And I'm guessing
that you need to be

19:26.065 --> 19:28.166
on your way to class,
right, Kath?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.736
(chuckles) Sounds like
somebody woke up

19:29.769 --> 19:31.671
on the wrong side
of the bed this morning.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.807
(mock chuckles) And guess what--
you were next to it.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.009
You know, I do need to dash.
My whole schedule's off

19:38.044 --> 19:39.412
because someone
kept me up all night.

19:39.445 --> 19:43.082
Well, it's been fun.
Toodles.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.182
Toodles.

19:47.118 --> 19:50.088
(clears throat)
Uh, you know what this means?

19:50.122 --> 19:52.424
Yes. Not only does she
take my sweater,

19:52.459 --> 19:54.527
but now she has to
horn in on my dreams.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.061
She is
the most ever mooch...

19:56.095 --> 19:59.065
Oh, I haven't even
gotten to the floss.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.201
Buffy, focus, please?

20:02.234 --> 20:04.336
Now, if Kathy and you
are having the same nightmares,

20:04.371 --> 20:07.073
chances are
something happened to you both

20:07.105 --> 20:08.875
when you met
the demon in the woods.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.542
So, we need to figure out
if this ritual

20:10.576 --> 20:14.413
they're dreaming about has some
special use or meaning.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.016
Cool. You guys
can do the brain thing,

20:17.048 --> 20:19.018
I'm gonna go to class.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.119
Which could also be construed
as the brain thing.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.890
Not when you're minoring
in Napping 101.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.059
Okay, so that was
the evil twin, right?

20:28.094 --> 20:29.929
'Cause she was bordering on

20:29.961 --> 20:32.531
Cordelia-esque.
Well, she's
definitely pushing

20:32.565 --> 20:34.433
the stress meter
on this Kathy thing.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.703
I concur that she's
not, uh, herself,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.605
but you know, uh,
learning to live with someone

20:39.638 --> 20:42.308
can be a... a challenge.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.711
And she hasn't been sleeping.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.247
Right, then. Nothing to get
too concerned about.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.750
Still, uh,
let me know if she, um...

20:51.784 --> 20:53.286
Hits the red zone?

20:54.252 --> 20:55.755
Yes.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.667
(speaking demon language)

21:21.614 --> 21:23.615
(chanting)

21:34.826 --> 21:38.698
* But after all
is said and done *

21:38.730 --> 21:41.468
* You're gonna be
the lonely one *

21:41.500 --> 21:44.671
PARKER:
Lots of popular artists
who don't get their dues--

21:44.703 --> 21:46.204
Madonna, Whitney.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.874
That's so totally true.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.476
Parker?

21:49.509 --> 21:52.177
Hey. Uh, I just
stopped by to say...

21:52.211 --> 21:53.712
(chuckles)
...that.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.816
Uh, and bring you...

21:56.848 --> 22:01.621
You know, uh, to maximize
your dining hall exports.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.855
Uh, they're heavy duty.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.325
Plus freezer guard.
That's so...

22:06.358 --> 22:08.661
Parker was just gonna
leave his number and go, but...

22:08.694 --> 22:10.396
(chuckles)
We just started talking.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.732
He's such a blast.
The time just flew.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.167
Time, really?
How much time?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.204
Uh, I'm not sure.
We sort of

22:19.238 --> 22:20.707
got caught up
talking Red Wings.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.474
It turns out Kathy's
a closet hockey fan.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.544
I think it's the violence.
(laughs)

22:24.576 --> 22:27.012
Quit it. I told you
that was just between us.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.381
Uh, it could be
the sweaty men.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.249
Stop.

22:30.281 --> 22:31.550
Look, if you two
are gonna rassle,

22:31.584 --> 22:33.251
do you mind taking it outside?

22:33.285 --> 22:34.586
I have a lot of work to do.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.590
Sorry. Uh, I didn't realize.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.992
No, Parker, wait.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.595
Look, I'm sorry,

22:42.628 --> 22:44.730
I-I didn't mean to...
No, it's totally cool.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.198
I should go anyway.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.601
It was great of you to stop by.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.569
M-maybe we could
do it another time?

22:52.270 --> 22:54.373
Another time, for sure.

22:55.607 --> 22:56.776
Bye, Kathy.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.210
Bye. See you.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.186
It wouldn't have killed you
to be nice, you know.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.958
Looked like you were being
nice enough for the both of us.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.059
I wasn't moving in
on your territory,

23:14.093 --> 23:15.795
if that's what you mean.

23:15.827 --> 23:18.730
Right. Just like you didn't
destroy my sweater.

23:20.332 --> 23:21.933
(squeaking)

23:30.643 --> 23:32.979
I'm cold.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.914
Well, I'm hot. Deal with it.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.784
Do you know what
your problem is, Buffy?

23:37.817 --> 23:39.719
You?
Hardly.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.953
Your problem is you're spoiled.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.590
Maybe the world revolved around
you where you used to live,

23:44.624 --> 23:46.492
but it's share time now.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.996
Share time, huh? Fine.
I'll show you share time.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.152
You're worried
about her.

24:13.184 --> 24:15.453
Yeah, both of them.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.323
I mean, what kind
of demon runs around

24:17.355 --> 24:20.125
putting ooky blood dreams
into people's heads

24:20.159 --> 24:22.961
like some kind
of nightmare fairy?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.830
It's not right.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.932
Well, I'm against it.
(loud music plays in distance)

24:26.965 --> 24:30.169
And Buffy's completely
being not herself.

24:30.201 --> 24:31.938
If it wasn't for
this English paper,

24:31.971 --> 24:33.940
I'd be there right now,

24:33.972 --> 24:37.009
um, listening, doing
the girly best-friend thing.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.644
(people laughing, whooping)
(music gets louder)

24:38.677 --> 24:42.448
Well, I can do that.
You can?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.150
Well, I'm not saying
we'll braid each other's hair.

24:44.182 --> 24:46.152
Probably, but you know,
I can hang with her.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.619
Watch for signs
she's going over the edge.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.188
You're the best.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.324
Oh, she's probably
patrolling by now.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.660
Check around the science center,

24:53.692 --> 24:56.729
and if you need me, I'll be...

24:56.762 --> 24:58.497
(glass shatters)

24:58.530 --> 25:00.365
...at the library.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.398
BUFFY:
So then, Kathy's like,

25:33.432 --> 25:35.101
"It's share time," and I'm like,

25:35.134 --> 25:37.135
"Oh, yeah? Share this."

25:38.369 --> 25:39.939
So either
you hit her,

25:39.971 --> 25:42.240
or you did your wacky
mime routine for her.

25:42.273 --> 25:44.943
Well, I didn't
do either, actually,

25:44.977 --> 25:47.046
but she deserved it,
don't you think?

25:47.078 --> 25:49.115
Nobody deserves mime, Buffy.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.450
Oh, Kathy does.

25:51.482 --> 25:53.853
She deserves to be locked
in an invisible box

25:53.885 --> 25:56.555
and blown away
by an imaginary wind and...

25:56.588 --> 25:58.790
Forced to wear
a binding unitard?

25:58.825 --> 26:00.425
Yeah, the itchy kind.
It's perfect.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.693
Just here to help.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.596
Which I appreciate,

26:03.630 --> 26:06.699
but you've never come
on routine patrol

26:06.732 --> 26:10.236
with me before, Oz.
So, what's the deal?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.270
It seemed more
interesting than homework.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.472
As long as it's an elective.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.442
I can handle myself
alone, you know.

26:16.474 --> 26:18.544
Not in question.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.811
Good.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.380
So then, I go to
the refrigerator, right?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.650
And the label queen
has managed to put...

26:23.682 --> 26:25.951
Just a... just
a thought, Buffy--

26:25.984 --> 26:27.252
do you think that
all this ranting

26:27.286 --> 26:29.055
is scaring away
potential demons?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.957
You're right.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.925
Ooh! She's even
affecting my work now.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.560
She's the Titanic.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.529
She's a crawling
black cancer!

26:40.666 --> 26:44.302
She's... other
really bad things.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.771
On the plus side,
you killed the bench,

26:45.805 --> 26:48.307
which was looking shifty.

26:48.339 --> 26:50.643
This isn't funny, Oz.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.544
Something has to be done.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.784
Agreed.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.355
(clicking)

27:14.465 --> 27:15.734
(loud clicking)

27:19.705 --> 27:21.039
(thud)

27:29.580 --> 27:32.317
(booming)

27:38.156 --> 27:40.058
("Believe" by Cher begins)

27:42.493 --> 27:45.297
* After love, after love,
after love *

27:45.330 --> 27:47.866
* After love, after love,
after love, after love *

27:47.900 --> 27:50.536
(muffled): * After love, after
love, after love, after love *

27:54.405 --> 27:56.142
* No matter how hard I try

27:56.174 --> 27:58.344
(crackling)

27:58.376 --> 28:00.011
* You keep pushing me aside

28:05.517 --> 28:07.185
*

28:17.563 --> 28:19.530
I'm going to bed.

28:19.565 --> 28:23.169
* You're gonna be
the lonely one *

28:23.201 --> 28:26.806
* Do you believe
in life after love? *

28:43.221 --> 28:45.223
Mm.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.160
(softly groaning)

28:52.131 --> 28:54.633
Oh, jeez.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.603
I do what I can,

28:57.635 --> 29:00.105
but Buffy's difficult.
She's secretive, for one thing.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.208
She comes and goes at
all hours of the night.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.643
She leaves her gum
all over the place.

29:04.675 --> 29:06.545
Uh, it sounds like
things are rough,

29:06.577 --> 29:09.915
but don't you want to
be talking to Buffy about this?

29:09.949 --> 29:13.451
I would, but she's so touchy
about all kinds of weird stuff.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.721
I mean, sometimes
I get the feeling that she's

29:15.753 --> 29:17.256
not quite normal,

29:17.288 --> 29:18.624
you know?

29:18.656 --> 29:21.359
Well, normal is relative, right?

29:26.765 --> 29:27.866
Later, okay?

29:31.136 --> 29:33.439
Why were you talking to her?

29:33.471 --> 29:36.474
Buffy, come on.
We-we were just saying hi.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.443
Yeah, that's what
she wants you to think.

29:38.477 --> 29:42.114
Buffy, this has to stop.
I mean, I get it.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.982
I have a sucky roomie, too.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.617
But you just have to deal.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.619
You're right.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.455
I've been thinking
a lot about this

29:50.489 --> 29:53.325
and it's clear to me now.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.361
Good.
That's better.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.364
Kathy's evil.
I'm an evil fighter.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.199
It's simple.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.233
I'm gonna have to kill her.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.108
You have to kill her?

30:10.142 --> 30:12.211
Don't you think you could just

30:12.243 --> 30:14.445
switch rooms or something?

30:14.480 --> 30:17.016
Well, I would, but it's not
just me in danger from Kathy.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.817
Look.

30:21.086 --> 30:23.154
Toenails?

30:23.189 --> 30:25.723
Evil toenails.
I took them off the floor

30:25.757 --> 30:27.558
last night when she was
in the bathroom.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.127
She thought I was asleep.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.729
Good thinking. 'Cause in
the middle of the night,

30:30.761 --> 30:32.830
those toenails
could have attacked you

30:32.865 --> 30:35.666
and left little half moon marks
all over your body.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.536
Don't be ridiculous.

30:37.568 --> 30:39.704
The point is I measured them
before I fell asleep

30:39.738 --> 30:41.707
and again this morning.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.375
And they grew,

30:43.409 --> 30:44.742
after they were cut.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.677
That's a demon thing.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.713
She has to be eliminated.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.582
Of course.
It makes sense now.

30:50.615 --> 30:52.984
But you'd better
show those bad puppies to Giles

30:53.019 --> 30:56.154
before you do anything.
Just to be sure.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.689
Oh, absolutely.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.590
I don't want to do
anything crazy.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.260
Uh, you hurry on to Giles',
I'll hang here

31:02.294 --> 31:04.096
and-and keep an eye on Kathy.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.231
Great. Good.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.299
Thanks, Will.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.611
Giles, I just talked
to Buffy and, yeah,

31:19.644 --> 31:23.015
I think she's feeling
a little insane.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.084
No, not-not bitchy crazy,

31:25.116 --> 31:28.119
more like
homicidal maniac crazy.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.990
So I told her
to come see you, okay?

31:33.125 --> 31:35.661
Giles?

31:37.628 --> 31:40.465
Anybody home?

31:42.300 --> 31:43.801
Hello?

31:43.835 --> 31:45.237
Oh!

31:46.837 --> 31:49.607
What are you guys doing?
This is...

31:49.641 --> 31:51.376
this is ridiculous.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.444
XANDER:
Buffy, this hurts me more
than it hurts you.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.746
Not yet, but it will.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.147
Don't say that.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.384
Oh, please don't say that.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.152
Ow!
We're doing this to stop you

32:00.185 --> 32:01.686
from making a terrible mistake.
(grunts)

32:04.589 --> 32:06.992
Clearly,
something is amiss.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.728
Yeah, something's amiss here--
a Ms. Kathy Newman.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.730
Giles... Ow.
Giles, look in my bag.

32:11.762 --> 32:14.165
Look in the bottom
pocket of my bag.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.569
She has parts that keep growing
after they're detached.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.272
She irons her jeans.
She's evil.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.142
She has to be destroyed.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.411
I fear the demon
that Buffy met in the woods

32:25.443 --> 32:27.512
has somehow possessed her.
Lite FM.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.480
Love songs.
Nothing but love songs.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.816
You think?

32:30.848 --> 32:32.584
Um, you stay
and watch her.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.020
I-I know a spell that will
make the possessing demon

32:35.054 --> 32:37.022
reveal itself so that
we can fight it,

32:37.056 --> 32:39.924
But I need to get some supplies
from the magic shop.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.660
Buffy, I...

32:43.461 --> 32:44.829
See you around.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.000
(door opens, closes)

32:52.804 --> 32:54.472
Can I come in?

32:54.506 --> 32:55.673
Sure.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.045
Where's Buffy?

32:59.077 --> 33:01.946
I don't know, exactly.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.049
But I've been
thinking--

33:04.083 --> 33:06.551
it might be a good idea
for you and Buffy

33:06.585 --> 33:09.988
to give each other
some apart time.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.289
In fact,
you might

33:11.323 --> 33:13.025
want to be, uh, apart

33:13.058 --> 33:14.826
before she gets back.

33:14.859 --> 33:17.462
What do you mean?
I should leave the room?

33:17.496 --> 33:19.065
Why should I go?

33:19.097 --> 33:21.032
It's not fair, I know.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.634
You bet it's not fair.
Having to live with someone

33:23.669 --> 33:25.136
who's obviously troubled.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.205
Someone who so
clearly needs to be

33:27.239 --> 33:29.340
in a home, not in a dorm.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.076
I don't know about that.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.811
Buffy's going through
something, yes, but...

33:33.845 --> 33:35.181
I wouldn't put it
past her to drop out

33:35.213 --> 33:36.914
or take off or something.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.483
Do something horrible
to herself.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.219
Herself?
Or worse.

33:40.251 --> 33:42.253
She's capable of it, you know?

33:42.288 --> 33:45.757
You can see it in those
shifty little eyes of hers.

33:45.790 --> 33:49.494
One of these days she might
even push somebody too far.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.130
(phone rings)

33:52.897 --> 33:55.032
Hello?

33:55.067 --> 33:56.934
It's Oz.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.404
Hi.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.672
You did?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.409
She's at Giles'? O-Okay.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.512
You know, during that...

34:07.546 --> 34:08.780
really short phone call

34:08.813 --> 34:10.849
I realized you are so right.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.918
I mean, it's not fair to make
you leave your own room.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.554
So, you're good.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.590
You just stay right there, okay?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.927
I can't believe this. After all
that we've been through

34:22.960 --> 34:25.097
together, and you guys won't
believe me when I tell you that

34:25.130 --> 34:26.532
Kathy is bad.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.266
We want to, Buff.
It's just...

34:28.300 --> 34:29.967
Shh. Don't engage.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.536
(grunts)

34:31.570 --> 34:33.105
I don't know

34:33.139 --> 34:35.440
if I tightened
those ropes enough.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.443
Well, then we'd better
go over there and check 'em.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.277
(laughs)

34:43.914 --> 34:45.251
Oh, dear God.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.456
Avoid the legs.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.659
Avoid the legs.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.762
(both grunt)

34:58.429 --> 35:00.798
Nope. Not tight enough.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.211
Kathy.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.181
Buffy.

35:17.715 --> 35:20.552
I think we need
to talk. Don't you?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.422
Absolutely.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.791
Let's talk.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.829
Oops. Look what I did.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.635
Oh, look what I did.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.175
(grunting)

35:45.710 --> 35:47.746
(growls)

35:49.681 --> 35:50.949
I knew it.

35:50.981 --> 35:52.217
(growls)

35:56.422 --> 35:58.423
(chanting in demon language)

36:15.541 --> 36:16.641
Quit it!

36:16.675 --> 36:17.909
I knew it. I knew you were

36:17.943 --> 36:19.378
one of those demon things.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.878
You know, why don't you
just stuff it

36:20.911 --> 36:22.981
and let me finish my ritual.
Ritual?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.382
"The Ritual of Mok'tagar,

36:24.416 --> 36:26.184
"a race of
transdimensional demons,

36:26.217 --> 36:28.085
"involves the forced
ingestion of animal blood

36:28.119 --> 36:31.590
while the victim slumbers."

36:31.623 --> 36:33.391
Buffy's nightmares...

36:33.425 --> 36:35.327
...were real.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.429
I left my dimension
to go to college

36:37.463 --> 36:39.530
and they sent
these guys after me.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.199
"But while the Mok'tagar can
assume many forms and guises,

36:42.233 --> 36:44.168
"including human,
they can always be recognized

36:44.202 --> 36:46.538
"by others of their kind...

36:46.572 --> 36:48.873
due to their lack of a soul."

36:48.907 --> 36:50.208
So I'm borrowing yours.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.577
Without even asking.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.210
Tonight when they come
looking for me

36:53.244 --> 36:55.681
they'll take the one
 without a soul.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.949
Oh, thank God I don't have to
watch you floss anymore.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.784
And I won't have to
live with a slob.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.289
(grunting)

37:08.659 --> 37:09.927
(growling)

37:09.960 --> 37:11.597
(yells)

37:21.407 --> 37:23.809
It's share time, Buffy.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.110
(growling)

37:28.447 --> 37:32.284
Fine. Let's start
with my sweater.

37:36.521 --> 37:37.755
Oh.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.432
Oh, why couldn't
Giles have shackles

37:47.465 --> 37:49.934
like any self-
respecting bachelor?

37:49.967 --> 37:52.771
Guys, I just saw Kathy
and she's acting...

37:52.804 --> 37:54.606
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

37:54.639 --> 37:56.907
Yeah. Buffy's got a pretty
good lead on us, though.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.244
I'll call Kathy,
tell her to get out of there.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.780
All you had to do
was write...

38:01.813 --> 38:04.449
down... your...

38:04.483 --> 38:05.182
calls!

38:05.215 --> 38:06.952
No answer.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.355
Toenails.

38:09.387 --> 38:11.856
Buffy was right.
Kathy's toenails

38:11.889 --> 38:13.492
not only keep growing
after they've been cut,

38:13.525 --> 38:16.461
they actually regenerate
if they're destroyed.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.128
And that's a demon thing?

38:18.163 --> 38:19.998
Oh, unequivocally, yes. So...

38:20.030 --> 38:21.800
Where is Buffy?

38:24.034 --> 38:27.105
Oh, dear. We have even
less time than I feared.

38:27.137 --> 38:29.507
I've looked up all known
regenerating demons,

38:29.541 --> 38:32.277
and only one species
practices the ritual

38:32.309 --> 38:33.945
that Buffy's been seeing
in her sleep.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.681
It's used to steal the soul
from a human body.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.384
Whoa, wait, are you saying
that Buffy's

38:38.416 --> 38:39.885
been doing a Linda Blair on us

38:39.918 --> 38:42.052
because Kathy's been
sucking her soul?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.621
I believe so, yes.
Excuse me, please.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.391
So Buffy
was right all along.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.458
Later on, big remorse.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.460
Now, I've found
a spell that should

38:49.494 --> 38:52.898
reverse the soul transfer
procedure immediately.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.065
Willow and I will
perform it at once.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.302
Leaving Xander and me
to help Buffy in the flesh.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.338
Hear me,
elders of the upper reaches,

39:00.371 --> 39:02.239
elders of the lower reaches,

39:02.273 --> 39:04.476
elders of the dry land,

39:04.510 --> 39:06.711
elders of the river flats.

39:06.744 --> 39:09.481
(yelling)

39:09.514 --> 39:10.916
Ah ha.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.387
(growling)

39:23.561 --> 39:25.230
(crashing)
Do you mind?

39:25.262 --> 39:28.032
People are trying to study.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.208
Ancients, I beseech you.
The soul abstracted,

39:38.242 --> 39:40.277
let it revert to its true seat.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.579
(grunting)

39:41.612 --> 39:42.981
Window's open. Happy?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.224
Open up. Let me finish.

39:53.257 --> 39:55.726
Let it be finished. Let the
unnatural vessel be emptied.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.128
Let the essence be returned
to its original host.

40:09.139 --> 40:10.775
How did you do...

40:37.469 --> 40:39.336
(growls)

40:50.949 --> 40:52.182
(screams)

41:13.371 --> 41:15.039
* Hoping

41:15.072 --> 41:17.943
* Hope that you're the one

41:17.976 --> 41:19.545
How's that?

41:19.577 --> 41:20.978
Mm-mmm. A little to the left.

41:22.347 --> 41:24.516
There. Perfect.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.952
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here, Will.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.487
I can already feel all that bad
Kathy karma just draining away.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.291
About that-- the Kathy thing.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.393
I'm sorry I doubted you.

41:35.425 --> 41:37.563
You're completely forgiven.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.731
I mean, you had reason to doubt.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.498
Except for the soul
sucking thing,

41:41.532 --> 41:43.668
I bet Kathy was pretty regular

41:43.702 --> 41:45.704
as far as roomies go.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.539
That's a pretty big "except."

41:47.572 --> 41:49.675
I guess. I'm just glad

41:49.708 --> 41:52.911
that it was Kathy's demony ways
making me no-fun Buffy.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.346
I've always thought I was
pretty easy going, you know?

41:55.380 --> 41:57.014
It's not like I have
the big issues.

41:57.047 --> 41:58.349
I don't burn incense or...

41:58.382 --> 42:00.217
You gonna finish this?

42:42.960 --> 42:45.429
Grr. Argh.
