WEBVTT

00:17.767 --> 00:19.144
Oh, my God.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.520
Fuck, Cass?

00:20.603 --> 00:22.272
Cass, fuck, are you okay?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.189
Are you hurt?
Are you--

00:23.273 --> 00:24.315
-Mm-mm.
-Oh.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.651
Okay. Um...

00:26.735 --> 00:28.945
Uh, we're gonna
need a minute

00:29.028 --> 00:30.739
or, um, many minutes,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.950
and, uh,
maybe very strong coffee.

00:34.033 --> 00:37.287
Coffee. Coffees.
Okay.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.122
God.
Okay, Annie, listen to me.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.583
I do not need the
why-are-you-fucked-up face

00:41.666 --> 00:42.834
that you're making.
I just--

00:42.917 --> 00:44.961
Please don't.
I can't do it right now.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.338
Okay, well,
you can't see my face

00:47.422 --> 00:48.673
'cause your eyes are closed,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.008
so you don't know
what my face looks like.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.385
Okay, can we just maybe
skip to the

00:52.469 --> 00:54.471
you're-disappointed-in-me
conversation

00:54.554 --> 00:56.139
'cause that's
what I deserve right now.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.391
And I--that's just--please,
just get there and move on.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.059
I know, how about
we let me decide

01:00.143 --> 01:01.311
what's going on
in my own brain.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.812
-Annie.
-Mm-hmm.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.939
I need you to get out
of my house.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.149
-No.
-Get out!

01:06.232 --> 01:07.567
-No.
-I'm not fucking around!

01:07.650 --> 01:09.360
Get out of my house now!

01:13.406 --> 01:15.033
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.120
I thought if I quit drinking,

01:19.204 --> 01:21.539
all my problems would go away
but they're all still here.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.711
And I just ended up
drunk on a beach.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.590
Okay. Well, that explains
why you're all sandy.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.634
So, mystery solved there.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.348
Okay, look, you fell off
the fucking wagon.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.184
That happened.
Now what?

01:43.603 --> 01:46.564
You know what? I'm gonna make
a list of all of the things

01:46.648 --> 01:48.942
that you can do.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.778
Okay.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.031
Wow.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.035
There's a lot of
Imperial Atlantic pens, Cassie.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.120
Are we stealing pens again?

02:01.204 --> 02:03.039
I don't deserve
to joke around right now.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.834
Jesus fucking Christ, Cass.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.419
No one expects perfection.
Okay, you made it a year.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.712
That's huge.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.883
I did not make it a year.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.802
I've been lying.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.138
I've slipped many times.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.271
-Did you hear what I said?
-Mm-hmm.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.730
I heard you.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.776
Okay, so, uh, number one,
tell the truth about drinking.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.197
Number two, clean up your...

02:36.281 --> 02:38.491
super fucked
and trashed apartment.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.412
Number three,
trust your best friend, Annie.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.833
What else?

02:49.502 --> 02:52.547
Guess I have to...

02:52.630 --> 02:56.217
apologize to Marco
for being horrible.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.844
Yes.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.930
There's also this whole
person-impersonating-you-

03:01.014 --> 03:03.099
and-doing-criminal-shit thing.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.392
Well, see,
there are other people

03:04.475 --> 03:06.144
that can solve crimes,
not just me.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.313
I'm not a CIA agent.
I'm not real.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.483
I need to just focus
on being sober.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.110
I can't do this anymore.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.946
Okay. That's huge.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.991
Decide to make
a huge life change.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.827
I mean, that's a lot more than
I can say for myself right now.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.120
What do you mean?

03:24.203 --> 03:27.248
After everything last year,
I, um, just--

03:27.332 --> 03:29.667
fuck, I just don't
trust myself anymore.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.877
I don't know,
I'm constantly afraid

03:30.960 --> 03:32.921
I'm gonna make
the wrong choice,

03:33.004 --> 03:37.133
you know, like about
the job and Max and, um, just...

03:38.509 --> 03:39.260
everything.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.887
Um, but, you know,

03:40.970 --> 03:42.555
I'm looking around
this apartment right now

03:42.639 --> 03:44.432
and thinking that we do not
need to be talking about me.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.892
Annie,
you're the best person I know.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.644
You're the best
in the whole world.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.103
I mean, just go
with your gut always.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.564
Life advice from someone
who just kissed

03:51.648 --> 03:53.608
their entire security deposit
goodbye.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.612
I really fucked up.

04:01.032 --> 04:05.078
"Oh, Annie,
you're such a good person."

04:06.204 --> 04:07.664
What happened to you?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.290
Okay, "What happened to you?"

04:09.374 --> 04:11.376
Aren't you supposed to be
all nice and kind

04:11.459 --> 04:12.961
and "perfect like me"?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.212
Oh, "All perfect like me."

04:14.295 --> 04:16.839
No, that idealistic bitch
is dead.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.842
See, every time you ignore her,
she feels more and more useless.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.346
and so now I get to be
the nightmare that you need.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.014
See, when you wipe away
all the lies

04:25.098 --> 04:26.349
and the bullshit excuses,

04:26.432 --> 04:27.725
I'm what's left.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.187
This is what you look like.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.564
God, if I were you,
I'd wish I was dead.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.988
Okay, I would like to sleep
for like a thousand hours.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.489
Oh, my God, what time is it?

04:41.572 --> 04:43.116
I'm supposed to fly back
to New York with Davey today.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.368
I'm doing the--the clean out
my mom's house, you know,

04:45.451 --> 04:47.328
and doing
the weird forgiveness letter...

04:47.412 --> 04:49.038
-The thing for your dad?
-Yes.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.832
But I can't go, right?
I can't do that now.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.251
You absolutely can go.
You should go.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.585
It's gonna be super cathartic.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.255
No, I smell like
the floor of a bar.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.757
Well, that's correct. Yeah.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.635
But look, Cass,
this is good, okay?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.722
If you aren't here, the double
can't pin anything on you

05:05.805 --> 05:07.890
and investigators
can investigate

05:07.974 --> 05:11.894
and you can just go
have some time and be Cassie.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.023
I'm way too hung over to even
think about that right now.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.151
-Cassie, this is Benjamin Berry.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.112
That's my handler.
What the fuck is he doing here?

05:21.195 --> 05:22.572
Is that
the one you slept with?

05:22.655 --> 05:23.865
There's only one
that I slept with.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.575
Okay, okay. Shh, shh.
Okay. Okay.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.035
You need to get the fuck out
of here and I will handle him.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.327
Oh, I left my car at the beach.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.829
-Get a fucking Uber, Cassie.
-Sorry.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.247
-Okay, but you can't--
-Go!

05:31.330 --> 05:33.207
Okay, I'm going out
of the back.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.793
Fuck. Okay.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.886
Wow.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.304
Well, um, excuse me.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.598
You can't just come
into someone else's home.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.933
-Who the fuck are you?
-My name is Benjamin Berry.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.101
I work with Cassie.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
-Is she here?
-No, she's not here.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.148
Um, and you can't just,
like, come over

05:57.231 --> 05:59.942
in the middle of the night
to discuss "airline" business.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.444
I thought she lived alone.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.780
Oh, you thought she lived alone?
That's interesting. Okay.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.782
Well, you guys must be
very close as colleagues,

06:05.865 --> 06:07.950
if you're so intimate
with her living arrangements.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.828
Do you have some sort of ID
or badge that could verify

06:10.912 --> 06:11.996
who you are as a human?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.456
-No.
-Okay.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.166
But there was an incident
at work, and I thought I'd--

06:16.626 --> 06:18.836
So...are we done?

07:50.052 --> 07:51.429
Hey, Rick,
are you looking for Davey?

07:51.512 --> 07:54.182
Uh, no, actually I was calling
to talk to you

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
to make sure you're okay.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.560
Oh, that's so sweet,
but what do you mean?

07:57.643 --> 07:58.853
Oh, maybe
I'm not supposed to know.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.563
Sorry.
But when Davey said

08:00.646 --> 08:02.732
he was extending his trip
in L.A. longer again,

08:02.815 --> 08:04.275
he dropped some hints
that you were really

08:04.358 --> 08:05.902
going through some stuff.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.905
Is that what he--
what he told you?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.740
I just wanted you to know
that the girls and I,

08:10.823 --> 08:12.909
we're here for you, too...

08:12.992 --> 08:14.118
in spirit.

08:14.202 --> 08:18.164
-Thank you.
-Okay, well, uh...talk soon.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.090
And you packed
your letter, right?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.968
Do you need me to go over it
or maybe proofread it for you?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.178
Okay, stop.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.512
I don't need you
to proofread my letter.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.555
It's fine.
It's not a school project.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.640
Come on. Come on.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.601
Bro, really, it's clean.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.020
And you're good to go
to Mom's after, right?

08:41.103 --> 08:43.105
I guess.
I'm fine going to Mom's

08:43.189 --> 08:44.941
to clear out
whatever she needs cleared out

08:45.024 --> 08:46.609
as long as she's not there
like we talked about.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.527
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
We've gone over this.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.446
She's away at
her meditation retreat.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.114
I mean, that's hilarious, right?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.158
Someone should tell her
it's not working.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.952
How would you know?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.912
You talk to her
once a year at Christmas.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.333
Just--Would it be so bad
if you two just, you know,

09:02.416 --> 09:03.793
sat together and talked?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.462
Oh, Davey, can we please
not talk about Mom right now?

09:06.545 --> 09:09.298
Come on.
Like, that's like way too much.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.842
-You can't fix everything.
-Okay.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.305
Flight attendants,
doors for departure,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.848
cross-check and all call.

09:28.567 --> 09:32.071
Okay, so we are boarded
and strapped in

09:32.154 --> 09:34.865
and pretty much stuck together
for the next six hours,

09:34.949 --> 09:37.243
so you cannot get mad at me.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.786
Uh, I drank last night

09:38.869 --> 09:40.705
and it's not the first time
I've slipped

09:40.788 --> 09:42.373
and I couldn't sit here
and not tell you

09:42.456 --> 09:44.583
'cause I just can't do that
and I'd feel like shit about it.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.961
And that's what happened,
and I'm sorry.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.679
The fact that you waited
till the doors were closed

09:56.762 --> 09:58.222
really...

10:01.767 --> 10:03.602
Are you all right?

10:06.022 --> 10:07.732
No.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.192
But I'm not gonna drink again.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.362
At least I'm not gonna
drink right now.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.906
Why?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.075
We shouldn't be
going on this tri--

10:18.159 --> 10:19.493
Why are we going on this trip?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.037
Well,
according to FAA regulations,

10:21.120 --> 10:22.580
we can't exactly
change our mind.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.707
And, um...

10:24.790 --> 10:26.917
I don't know,
fuck, maybe...

10:27.001 --> 10:28.377
maybe it's gonna be good
for me, you know,

10:28.461 --> 10:31.464
like, clearing out
our childhood stuff,

10:31.547 --> 10:32.840
throwing things away.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.718
It's like a... new start,

10:35.801 --> 10:37.636
clean slate,
I don't fucking know.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.764
Something like that--Carol...

10:39.847 --> 10:41.932
-Whoa. Yay. Hi.
-Hi.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.769
I'm like your lucky rabbit's
foot following you around.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.729
No, you're not lucky.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.148
You're a bad penny.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.399
You're also in C and E.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.525
You need to be
in your ticketed seats.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.902
There's no one in this seat.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.613
Sir, do not--do not
raise your voice at me.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.323
I am not your adversary.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.909
Okay. Carol. Jesus.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.037
By the way, this is the reason
we don't invite you to brunch.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.291
I hate you.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.546
It's--I'm just--

11:12.630 --> 11:15.800
It's frustrating, you know.
It's heartbreaking.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.885
You just threw away
all that work.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.430
Everything you're feeling
and everything you're saying

11:21.514 --> 11:22.765
is right.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.517
So...

11:34.693 --> 11:36.278
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:36.362 --> 11:38.155
this Imperial Atlantic flight
to New York's

11:38.239 --> 11:41.659
John F. Kennedy Airport
will be departing shortly.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.050
Come here.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.764
Baby!

12:03.848 --> 12:05.975
You sent me a note
with a customer.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.351
Oh, he doesn't know who I am.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.478
Are you even allowed
to be here right now?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.063
Yes. Of course I am.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.731
That's why I came to see you.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.360
Baby.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.531
Can I give you a hug, please?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.828
Oh. Eli.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.330
Oh, my God,
I missed you so much.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.832
-You have no idea.
-Yes, I do.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.835
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

12:32.918 --> 12:35.004
How'd you, uh--
how'd you know I worked here?

12:35.087 --> 12:37.089
Oh, I stopped by
your swim practice

12:37.173 --> 12:38.466
and your friend Jake told me
you were here.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.384
-You talked to Jake?
-Yeah.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.678
-Fuck.
-Eli. Language.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.555
-Sorry.
-And don't worry, okay?

12:44.638 --> 12:45.890
I bribed him
and I threatened him.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.101
Jesus. Um...Okay.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.644
I mean, I quit the swim team
so I could pick up

12:50.728 --> 12:52.104
an extra shift at work.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.731
Why?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.650
Listen, don't worry about it,
okay?

12:56.734 --> 12:59.361
I'm gonna stop by the house
and I'm gonna talk to Dad,

12:59.445 --> 13:01.113
and we're gonna figure
all of this out.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.659
Dad...had to sell the house.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.455
To pay the legal bills.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.915
Lost his job.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.920
I didn't know.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.173
Are you gonna disappear again?

13:21.175 --> 13:24.303
Absolutely not. Okay?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.515
-I promise.
-Okay.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.186
-Can I get another hug?
-Yeah, Mom.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.230
Missed you.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.385
Hey, dummy. It's too late.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.345
He's already dead.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.285
Hey. While you're here,

14:29.368 --> 14:30.661
why don't you do
something useful

14:30.744 --> 14:33.289
and dig a fucking hole
for yourself?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.833
Take the fucking shovel.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.629
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.636
"Dad,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.305
"you taught me
how to make eggs

14:49.388 --> 14:53.934
"and how to start a campfire...

14:54.018 --> 14:55.686
"and how to hunt.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.107
"You were fun and funny.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.860
"You were my best friend
in the whole world.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.448
"You were also an alcoholic.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.827
"You introduced me to drinking

15:11.910 --> 15:14.330
"and it made me feel
so special.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.293
"Then you died.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.923
"And all I had left of you
was the alcohol.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.386
"That's the only part
I had to remember you.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.225
"So here I am as an adult...

15:37.436 --> 15:39.647
"an alcoholic adult...

15:42.441 --> 15:47.029
reading a letter
in a fucking graveyard."

15:47.112 --> 15:48.697
Fuck.

15:50.949 --> 15:54.495
"Your little girl turned out
just like you,

15:55.913 --> 15:57.748
"and I hate that.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.377
"I hate it.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.547
"You kept going back
to drinking,

16:05.631 --> 16:08.050
"and so, I do, too.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.095
"And it makes me hate myself.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.266
"I forgive you for hurting me,

16:17.142 --> 16:20.437
"forgive you for hurting Davey,

16:20.521 --> 16:23.691
"and I forgive you
for hurting Mom.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.652
"I love you,

16:27.945 --> 16:30.322
"but I will not be you.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.368
"I will not be you.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.955
Goodbye."

16:44.169 --> 16:46.672
I think we should probably go
before I drink the gasoline

16:46.755 --> 16:48.132
out of the car.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.300
Then let's go.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.813
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.442
You should try the tea.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.943
Hmm, tea?

17:08.026 --> 17:10.946
Uh, yeah, it's, um, fennel.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.449
I don't know,
the stupid fucking package

17:13.532 --> 17:15.784
said that it was good
for calming the nerves, so...

17:15.868 --> 17:17.327
Oh, we're tea people now, huh?

17:17.411 --> 17:18.787
I don't know.
I just thought,

17:18.871 --> 17:20.789
after the whole
breaking and entering thing

17:20.873 --> 17:24.126
and then,
you know, finding Cass

17:24.209 --> 17:27.921
in full-blown
"Brokedown Palace" mode

17:28.005 --> 17:31.800
that, um,
I'd give calm nerves a shot.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.595
Yeah. She's got some stuff
to figure out.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.682
So, not for nothing,

17:38.766 --> 17:41.894
but, um, I kind of feel like

17:41.977 --> 17:45.314
we have some stuff
we need to figure out, too.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.026
I... I--Yeah, I'm--

17:49.109 --> 17:50.652
I'm sorry
I lost my temper in the car.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.987
I really am.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.573
But can we focus
on the Diazes for a sec?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.033
There's a lot of info
on this laptop

17:56.116 --> 17:57.993
and I'm just really trying
to get through it.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.661
These people
are a piece of work.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.164
I mean, different identities,
different appearances,

18:02.247 --> 18:05.125
multiple addresses,
multiple records

18:05.209 --> 18:07.753
of people they've tortured.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.339
There's nothing here that pins
'em down to who they really are.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.217
They're just fucking ghosts
and we fucked with them.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.428
So, it's kind of the part
we need to know.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.763
Wow.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.850
Well, no matter how bad
a person I think I am,

18:21.934 --> 18:24.436
I guess there's always
gonna be some insane couple

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
out there kidnapping and
torturing people

18:26.522 --> 18:28.899
to make me feel
better about myself.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.776
-Hey.
-Hmm?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.320
You're not a bad person.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.658
Yeah. Um, okay.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.829
It's just...

18:41.912 --> 18:43.413
I need you to know that I know

18:43.497 --> 18:45.541
that the ring
is important to you.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.626
-And so, it's important to me

18:47.709 --> 18:51.046
and that's why
I was wearing it. Um...

18:52.923 --> 18:54.007
So, yeah, that.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.384
I loved that
you were wearing it.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.345
I love you.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.849
And the other stuff,
that's just...

19:01.932 --> 19:04.726
that's just stuff
we're gonna figure out.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.894
Sure. And, you know,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.772
like my, um,
crippling indecisiveness

19:08.856 --> 19:11.567
isn't...about you.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.278
You know, it's not about,
um, you.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.989
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.950
Okay, um...

19:20.033 --> 19:22.911
I'm done talking about
feelings now, so, um...

19:22.995 --> 19:24.538
Yeah,
can we change the subject?

19:24.621 --> 19:26.373
No, I love this awkward side
to you. This is beautiful.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.418
Um, I love that you can
go fuck yourself.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.962
Um, so...

19:34.047 --> 19:37.050
I am gonna
go cook us lunch

19:37.134 --> 19:38.635
in that, uh, kitchen,

19:38.719 --> 19:41.138
where people make food,
um, or dinner,

19:41.221 --> 19:44.433
you know, depending on how long
that takes. We'll see.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.475
But you can't cook.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.436
You want to take that back?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.314
I mean, you don't often cook.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.065
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.734
-It's fucking on.
-Can't wait.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.486
Yeah, I'm gonna blow your mind
with what I'm about to cook.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.613
My stomach is awaiting.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.197
-It's, "Mm-mm."
-Yeah, better be.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.259
Contact name and ID number?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.511
Evans, 11-7-53.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.014
Hold for connection.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.351
Mr. Berry.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.311
People are waiting for answers

20:29.394 --> 20:31.563
because the optics aren't good.
The optics.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.691
So I'm looking for answers,
not for the fucking optics,

20:34.775 --> 20:36.485
but for the families
of our colleagues

20:36.568 --> 20:37.736
who were murdered on US soil.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.697
So how
is the investigation going?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.324
Do you have any leads?

20:42.407 --> 20:44.576
Yeah, I'm actually circling
a person of interest right now.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.453
So, you're sleeping here,
but you're not actually

20:46.536 --> 20:48.038
getting anything done.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.706
Nothing work-related, anyway.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.042
I don't know
what you're implying,

20:52.125 --> 20:53.210
but I am doing my job.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.962
You're on thin ice, Mr. Berry.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.673
Look, if you're emotionally
compromised,

20:57.756 --> 21:00.592
we can provide access
to counselors for you.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.970
Dot, I really appreciate that.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.805
Thank you so much.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.391
But please don't give me
the counselor speech

21:07.474 --> 21:08.558
like I'm some new recruit.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.143
Then stop behaving like one,

21:10.227 --> 21:11.853
or I'm noting it
in your record.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.273
Oh, and about Cassie Bowden?

21:15.357 --> 21:16.900
Leave it alone.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.784
Call me when you land?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.037
I love you.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.664
We have a lot to think about.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.376
Justin, I was going
to tell you, I swear to God.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.545
It's not even about you
not telling me that

21:36.628 --> 21:38.422
you're, like,
frickin' Jason Bourne.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.758
It's that all of a sudden,
I'm deep in a relationship

21:41.842 --> 21:45.053
with a dude who could
like...die. Okay?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.389
I am gonna try not to die.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.813
I'm sorry.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.571
Shane Evans.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.865
Agent Evans, it's Benjamin Berry
in the LA office.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.700
You were Cassie Bowden's
recruiting agent.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.243
Do you know her personally?

22:08.326 --> 22:10.620
Yeah, well, she's not
my favorite person

22:10.704 --> 22:13.290
in the world right now,
but yes, I--I--I know her.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.624
Are you aware of her
involvement

22:14.708 --> 22:17.210
with any radicalized
political groups?

22:17.294 --> 22:19.838
Of course not. No, no.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.339
No. Why would I know that?
No.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.133
So, her history suggests
she's prone

22:23.216 --> 22:25.135
to mental illness,
substance abuse.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.429
I'm asking because
she's an unusual

22:27.512 --> 22:29.014
and unpredictable person.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.976
Well, now that we've established
that Cassie is...different,

22:33.060 --> 22:35.479
I can't provide any further
illumination into her character.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.272
-Listen, I gotta run.
-Evans.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.462
Max...

23:01.546 --> 23:03.215
pull yourself away
from your laptop

23:03.298 --> 23:06.426
and come eat your words
along with this epic meal

23:06.510 --> 23:08.845
that I prepared for us.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.764
It's sort of
too late for lunch,

23:10.847 --> 23:13.266
and it's too early for dinner.
So, is this supper?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.518
Did I make supper?

23:14.601 --> 23:16.311
-Hey.
-Success.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.729
Babe, um...

23:17.813 --> 23:19.397
Okay, I said pull yourself
away from your laptop,

23:19.481 --> 23:21.733
not pull your laptop
into our first

23:21.817 --> 23:23.485
horrifyingly domestic
moment together.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.986
This is not good.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.530
Okay, I certainly know you're
not talking about this

23:26.613 --> 23:28.240
epic meal that I slaved over.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.699
It's Cassie.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.494
Cool.
That's my least favorite answer,

23:32.577 --> 23:33.745
so what does that mean?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.247
The Diazes were sending
progress reports

23:35.330 --> 23:36.373
with, like, stalker-level info

23:36.456 --> 23:37.999
on Cassie to some Korean group.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.043
They have her flight
itinerary to New York,

23:40.127 --> 23:43.421
information on Davey, and
an address for a Lisa Bowden?

23:43.505 --> 23:46.675
Fuck. Cassie was stopping
by her mom's house.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.433
-- Great.
-- You know,

23:55.517 --> 23:57.102
how about
a root beer float?

23:57.185 --> 23:58.687
I've been craving
a root beer float.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.522
You know, kind of like
we used to do, you know?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.357
A little root beer,
a little ice cream, come on.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.692
Stop talking about
root beer floats.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.110
We'll get one later, okay?
Seriously.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.237
-No, you can't...
-Let's go.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.490
You know how completely useless

24:10.574 --> 24:11.825
I am when I'm hungry.
So, let's just--

24:11.908 --> 24:13.118
You know what?
I'm just gonna come back.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.703
I'm gonna do this
by myself sometime.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.371
-I'll take care of it.
-Davey, stop, listen to me.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.914
It's okay, it's okay.
I am fine.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.083
I'm fine, I'm fine,
and you're--you're fine.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.710
We're both fine, and, you know,

24:21.793 --> 24:23.253
I'm at least
functional enough

24:23.336 --> 24:25.046
to deal with this right now.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.631
This whole starting-over trip

24:26.715 --> 24:28.341
has really been
a punch in the face.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.260
Yeah, well, it wasn't supposed
to be a starting-over trip.

24:30.343 --> 24:33.221
That's what... Ugh! God!
That's what I'm saying.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.390
I'm sorry,
and I just would like

24:35.473 --> 24:39.060
for one thing
to go as planned, you know?

24:39.144 --> 24:40.979
No weird surprises.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.357
Oh...

24:46.276 --> 24:47.527
Hey, Mom.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.909
Jesus, Davey.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.328
You might have
given me a heads-up.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.339
Voicemail.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.341
Cassie, the Diazes are feeding
information about you

25:09.424 --> 25:11.259
to their employers,
and they know where you are.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.094
You need to go
somewhere safe immediately

25:13.178 --> 25:15.388
and you need to call me, okay?

25:15.472 --> 25:16.765
Call me.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.102
-She'll call.
-Mm-hmm.

25:21.186 --> 25:25.106
I've got laundry in,
the oven's on and...

25:25.190 --> 25:26.942
This is a mess.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.777
Sorry, Mom.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.033
When I heard you scratching
at the door,

25:35.116 --> 25:36.785
I thought
it was another break-in.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.162
Wait, what?
You had a break-in?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.372
Why didn't you tell me?

25:40.455 --> 25:42.499
Oh, 'cause, you know,

25:42.582 --> 25:43.959
they didn't take anything

25:44.042 --> 25:47.003
and just came in
and made a big mess,

25:47.087 --> 25:49.130
and probably just
a bunch of kids.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.674
Yeah, my apartment
got broken in to,

25:50.757 --> 25:53.468
so I... I know the feeling.
It can be really scary.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.387
Oh, yeah, that's right.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.973
You had that, you--
you had that break-in, too.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.474
Did they ever find who did it?

25:59.557 --> 26:01.476
Yeah, we did.
We're good friends now.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.646
Davey, did Cassie ever
tell you about

26:04.729 --> 26:07.440
her "good friends"
who used to come in here,

26:07.524 --> 26:09.776
lock the door, blast the music?

26:09.859 --> 26:11.987
Always a few bucks
missing from my purse.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.615
Mom, didn't that
happen like twice?

26:15.699 --> 26:19.703
Well, now that
we're all caught up,

26:19.786 --> 26:21.288
what are Cassie and I gonna
talk about

26:21.371 --> 26:22.706
on our Christmas phone call?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.124
Jesus, Mom!

26:26.084 --> 26:27.252
I didn't know about
Davey's little plan

26:27.335 --> 26:28.420
until now, either, okay?

26:28.503 --> 26:30.338
But I'm managing
to not be mean about it.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.013
You lied to me.
Are you kidding me?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.472
You give me shit
for lying to you

26:39.556 --> 26:41.099
and then you bring me here
and bombard me with Mom?

26:41.182 --> 26:42.475
This is not good
for my life right now.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.102
-Do you understand?
-I'll talk to her.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.521
Oh, you'll go talk to her?
Oh, that'll make it better.

26:46.604 --> 26:48.356
Oh, shit.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.359
Mom.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.361
-Mom.
-No.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.948
-- Please just--
-- I don't trust her.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.241
I know.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.784
I'm sorry, I just--

26:59.868 --> 27:02.579
I don't have the emotional space
for her right now.

27:02.662 --> 27:06.166
I--I'm sorry.
I just--I don't.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.417
-You should see the--
-Okay.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.877
So, I'm not just
gonna stand out there

27:08.960 --> 27:10.295
and listen to you guys
talk shit about me.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.880
So here I am,
I'm right here and--

27:11.963 --> 27:14.299
-I'm just gonna--
-No, you're not. You're staying.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.385
Here I am.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.847
I burned
the sweet potato fries.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.391
Okay. Mom.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.770
I'm sorry you burned
the sweet potato fries.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.107
Actually, um, no, I'm...

27:32.317 --> 27:34.027
I am sorry for being
a shitty daughter.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.320
How about that?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.198
Especially after Dad died.
It was terrible.

27:38.281 --> 27:41.284
I was a dysfunctional
alcoholic teenager

27:41.368 --> 27:44.329
and I'm the one that stole
money from your purse.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.289
I'm the one that did that,
not my friends. I did that.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.209
I know.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.128
You knew that? You knew that?
She knew that. Okay.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.714
Fuck. All right. Good.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.926
Um, taking responsibility
for my life and my actions

27:58.009 --> 28:00.845
is a big part of my journey now.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.140
So, um, Mom,

28:04.224 --> 28:08.436
I'm so sorry
that I was a sad, angry kid.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.106
I should have been nicer to you.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.900
I should've been kinder.
So, I'm sorry.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.404
Okay.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.531
Okay.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.658
Okay. That's it?

28:21.741 --> 28:23.368
Well...

28:24.327 --> 28:26.621
Is that it? Because...

28:26.704 --> 28:29.040
if that is it,
I don't really think

28:29.124 --> 28:31.584
that we are addressing
the issue here.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.670
Okay, well, if you're not gonna
accept my apology,

28:33.753 --> 28:35.338
how are we ever gonna
move on with our lives?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.966
-Your apology?
-Yeah.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.219
For being a kid
in a fucked-up household?

28:41.302 --> 28:44.431
Nobody's mad at you for what
you did when you were little.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.308
Your father died.

28:48.935 --> 28:51.104
Nobody knew what to do.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.189
I could have been better.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.066
Nobody's mad at anybody

28:55.150 --> 28:57.110
for what you did
when you were little.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.946
Okay.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.157
It's what you do
when you're an adult

29:02.240 --> 29:04.492
that matters, all right?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.828
You convinced me to come
and see you in the city.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.455
So I came...

29:09.456 --> 29:11.541
and you forgot about me.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.127
I didn't know where you were.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.004
I didn't know if you were
passed out in an alley

29:16.087 --> 29:17.213
or if you were dead.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.674
I spent those days
with your doorman.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.428
Then you came here,

29:23.511 --> 29:26.181
turned on the burner,
passed out in the living room

29:26.264 --> 29:27.932
and nearly burned
my house down.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.309
-Okay--
-Then,

29:29.392 --> 29:32.395
you go out
and you get a DUI...

29:32.479 --> 29:34.355
-Okay, stop.
-after your father...

29:34.439 --> 29:36.191
-Stop.
-kills himself...

29:36.274 --> 29:37.400
-Stop talking.
-driving drunk...

29:37.484 --> 29:38.693
-Stop talking!
-as a skunk.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.111
I don't want to hear--
Just, I don't--

29:40.195 --> 29:41.070
-You don't what?
-I don't.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.197
You don't want to remember,

29:42.280 --> 29:43.239
you don't want
to talk about it,

29:43.323 --> 29:44.532
you don't want to hear about it.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.035
Why? 'Cause you're just
like your father.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.745
He's sorry.
He was always sorry.

29:48.828 --> 29:53.291
Do you think an apology
is just gonna wax it all away?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.710
I am exhausted!

30:04.219 --> 30:07.805
Let's just cut
to the chase here, okay?

30:09.766 --> 30:11.017
Cassie.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.603
Cassie!

30:15.188 --> 30:17.106
When was your last drink?

30:24.739 --> 30:26.491
Well...

30:29.202 --> 30:31.120
I guess that clears that up.

30:33.331 --> 30:38.127
You know, Mom, there are things
that when you're a kid,

30:38.211 --> 30:42.215
you learn and they get really
lodged in your brain

30:42.298 --> 30:45.093
and it's really hard
to just get rid of them

30:45.176 --> 30:46.761
and turn it off, okay?

30:46.844 --> 30:49.097
I had a lot of years with Dad
learning to do the wrong thing,

30:49.180 --> 30:53.977
and no one really stepped in
to say otherwise.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.395
Oh, oh, okay.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.605
So this is why
you brought her here?

30:57.689 --> 31:00.233
So she could blame me
for her bullshit?

31:00.316 --> 31:03.528
Davey left you! I stayed!

31:03.611 --> 31:05.822
I might have been an asshole
but I stayed. He left you.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.782
Why is he your favorite?
Why does he have a pass?

31:07.865 --> 31:08.825
Why?

31:08.908 --> 31:11.160
-David is an adult.
-Oh, my...

31:11.244 --> 31:13.538
And that is what
you are supposed to do.

31:13.621 --> 31:14.789
You're supposed to grow.

31:14.872 --> 31:16.291
-You're supposed to learn.
-Really?

31:16.374 --> 31:18.084
And you're supposed to move on.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.629
Well, I am dragging
all this shit with me, okay?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.298
That's what I've been doing.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.591
Mom, I don't blame you.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.134
I don't blame you
for not stopping Dad.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.052
I don't blame you.
I know that you can't do that.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.638
I know that people have
to try and stop themselves.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.223
You cannot force anyone to stop.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.935
Okay, I hid the booze.
I drove you to counseling

31:36.019 --> 31:38.938
and I waited so that
you didn't run out the back.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.481
And I negotiated with the school

31:40.565 --> 31:42.775
so that you could stay
in school.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.653
Now it has been
20 years since then.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.323
Are you just gonna drag
this bullshit around with you

31:48.406 --> 31:50.116
for the rest of your life?

31:50.199 --> 31:52.410
Dad made me feel special.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.663
Okay? Not super fucked up.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.999
That is true, and I know
the more that I--

31:58.082 --> 32:01.586
time that I spent with him
just kept disappointing you.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.547
And that's horrible,
and I'm sorry.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.133
Do you know what a relief
it was to leave here

32:07.216 --> 32:10.136
and not be a constant
disappointment for you?

32:10.219 --> 32:11.763
Do you understand?

32:11.846 --> 32:14.140
To not be a constant
fucking disappoint for you?

32:14.223 --> 32:15.350
So I avoided you.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.518
I still avoid you
and I drank, a lot,

32:17.602 --> 32:20.605
because I love to fucking drink.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.524
And I have clocked every bottle
in this fucking kitchen,

32:23.608 --> 32:25.693
but I'm not touching it,
I'm not drinking it.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.111
I'm doing better,
I'm doing better.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.488
What else do I have to do
to show you

32:28.571 --> 32:30.156
that I'm doing better?

32:30.239 --> 32:32.283
Oh.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.663
-Cassie...
-Hmm.

32:36.746 --> 32:37.872
Honey.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.756
I love you.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.425
I do.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.389
But I don't like you...

32:54.472 --> 32:55.682
at all.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.849
-Mom.
-David.

32:56.933 --> 32:57.809
Mo--

33:02.480 --> 33:06.567
Now, I'm sure neither one
of you have eaten.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.319
There is food in the fridge.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.157
Just put it in the microwave
and press 2.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.701
Okay?

33:16.786 --> 33:18.413
I'm going to work.

33:35.638 --> 33:36.723
-Eli.
-Hi.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.141
What's the matter,
are you okay?

33:38.224 --> 33:40.017
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, Dad.
Ah, I'm okay.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.936
Geez, man,
your message scared me.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.480
I know. I know. I'm--
I'm really okay. It's okay.

33:44.564 --> 33:48.234
I just, uh, kind of had to get
you to come down here.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.530
Mom kind of has to stay
off the radar.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.494
Hi, Bill.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.791
Go back to work.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.043
What? No, it's fine. I--

34:06.127 --> 34:08.045
Go back to work.

34:34.697 --> 34:35.865
Aw!

34:35.948 --> 34:37.575
You're so fucking awesome.

34:37.658 --> 34:40.536
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.230
Jesus, Megan. Why?

35:07.313 --> 35:10.149
Why did you do this?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.486
I don't think the answer helps.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.739
I asked.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.741
So I'd like an answer.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.371
I wanted to feel special,

35:23.454 --> 35:24.705
to be seen.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.750
I guess I wasn't feeling that
from home,

35:27.834 --> 35:30.545
and--and I'm not blaming
you, Bill. I'm not, okay?

35:30.628 --> 35:32.797
I want to be
super clear about that.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.842
You are the sweetest man ever

35:35.925 --> 35:39.512
and incredibly kind,
but we were on autopilot.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.015
We weren't--
we weren't unhappy.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.810
You weren't unhappy, Bill,
but I was.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.020
You--

35:48.104 --> 35:50.523
And this time being away,
it made me realize

35:50.606 --> 35:51.899
that the only thing that I need,

35:51.983 --> 35:55.069
the only thing
that I want is you and Eli.

35:55.152 --> 35:57.446
The, uh...

35:57.530 --> 36:00.199
The FBI has told me that

36:00.283 --> 36:02.952
I need to call them
if you come back.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.079
-What?
-Or they're gonna prosecute.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.331
And Eli is,
you know, just...

36:10.001 --> 36:11.294
I have to protect our family.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.504
How is it "our family"
without me in it?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.298
I love you.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.843
And if I could start this
whole thing over again, I would.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.929
Oh, baby, at the drop of a hat,
I would.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.348
-But we can't.
-Please.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.400
Please, baby,
listen to me, listen to me.

36:34.483 --> 36:37.194
You don't have to do this.
You don't--Please.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.864
Please. Please.
Just don't--

36:39.947 --> 36:42.950
Bill! Please!

36:44.076 --> 36:46.954
Please!

37:02.553 --> 37:04.347
What are you doing in here?

37:04.430 --> 37:06.807
What? I'm doing
what we came here to do.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.142
Really?
Fireworks?

37:08.225 --> 37:09.727
You know, I can tell you
as a flight attendant,

37:09.810 --> 37:11.979
they're probably not gonna
allow those on the plane.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.608
Yeah, I don't know why
I stopped loving fireworks.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.026
Oh, I remember.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.028
I remember Dad once had you
hold a Roman candle

37:19.111 --> 37:20.446
and you burned your hand.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.573
Are you just gonna stand there?

37:22.657 --> 37:23.950
I thought you were gonna
help me with this.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.409
Uh, no, that was before
you ambushed me,

37:25.493 --> 37:27.328
so I'm pretty sure
I'm just gonna stand here.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.833
Yeah, I'm gonna
take them with me.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.962
And if the TSA wants
to wrestle me to the ground,

37:36.045 --> 37:37.254
then let them.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.798
-Oh, you're mad at me now.
-I'm not mad.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.466
Oh, okay.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.028
I had one
just like this as a kid.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.363
I had one, too.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.201
Santal 33...

38:07.284 --> 38:08.202
Okay.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.329
I thought it was
another break-in.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.795
Fuck!

38:19.297 --> 38:20.631
Dot, hey.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.385
So, um, I'm sorry,
I owe you a huge explanation.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.346
-Um, here's the thing.
-Look, I'm trusting you here.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.849
I've been digging, and
what you witnessed in Berlin

38:29.932 --> 38:32.893
is connected
to the analysts killed in LA.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.479
And now, to be honest with you,

38:35.563 --> 38:38.733
I'm having real doubts
about our mutual acquaintance,

38:38.816 --> 38:39.900
Mr. Berry.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.069
Wait, no, Benjamin?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.404
He was actually just at my place

38:43.487 --> 38:45.197
with this, like,
cloudy-eye guy from Berlin.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.242
Officer Jones?
That's Benjamin's errand boy.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.579
What?
Wait, you saw him in Berlin?

38:51.662 --> 38:54.081
-Shit.
-He was also at Echo Park Lake.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.417
Okay, we can't talk
about this on the phone.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.169
Can you meet me
in, say, half an hour?

38:58.252 --> 38:59.420
Uh, yeah, no,

38:59.503 --> 39:00.921
I'm actually
in New York till tomorrow.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.424
You need to get back here.
And, Cassie, be careful.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.220
Okay, Annie,
what the fuck--I... I...

39:08.304 --> 39:10.264
Cassie.

39:10.347 --> 39:13.350
There's a car outside
and it's just idling.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.020
All right.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.530
-Oh. We gotta go now.
-What?

39:26.614 --> 39:27.823
Just--We got to go right now.
Let's go.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.742
-What?
-Let's go. Come on.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.789
-Shh.
-Where are we going?

39:34.872 --> 39:36.832
-Just be quiet.
-Why?

39:36.916 --> 39:39.293
-Who are those guys?
-Davey, shut up!

39:40.127 --> 39:41.587
What is this?
What's happening?

39:41.670 --> 39:43.255
Okay, so one of my friends
may have sold secrets

39:43.339 --> 39:45.007
to the North Koreans,
and then my other friend

39:45.091 --> 39:47.802
might have killed one
of the North Koreans' friends.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.261
-What?
-Yeah.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.305
Jesus, Cassie,
make better friends.

39:51.388 --> 39:53.474
Oh, my God.
Davey, are you okay?

39:53.557 --> 39:54.725
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

39:54.809 --> 39:56.018
Jesus. Get up!

39:56.102 --> 39:57.895
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm fine. I know where to go.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.230
What do you mean,
you know where to go?

39:59.313 --> 40:00.898
-Follow me!
-Oh, God.

40:05.569 --> 40:09.406
-- Where are you going?
-- Oh, shit. This way.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.910
What is this place?

40:12.993 --> 40:14.829
How do you even know
about this place?

40:14.912 --> 40:17.164
We used to camp here
for Eagle Scouts.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.958
It was near here
and then I used to sneak here

40:19.041 --> 40:22.211
-to make out with Evan Casters.
-What?

40:22.294 --> 40:24.296
How did you not tell me
about this?

40:24.380 --> 40:27.007
I mean, even for you?
The North Koreans?

40:27.091 --> 40:29.218
Okay, how about the surprise
meetup with Mom?

40:29.301 --> 40:30.845
And hey,
should I mention Rick?

40:30.928 --> 40:32.346
I told Rick that I needed time

40:32.429 --> 40:34.557
because I just didn't want
to go home yet.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.891
Rick and I are taking
some time apart.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.852
-Wait, wait, what?
-You want to know?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.270
My OCD
is getting worse.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.522
And I snapped, okay?
I snapped at Eve.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.940
One morning
she spilled an orange juice

40:43.023 --> 40:44.316
and I screamed at her.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.527
I screamed in her face,
and you should have seen

40:46.610 --> 40:48.904
the look on her face.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.156
So, I came here to LA.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.365
Instead of dealing with
my problems,

40:51.448 --> 40:52.867
I started working
on yours instead.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.577
-So, you happy now?
-No, I'm not exactly happy.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.120
Can we just agree
to not wait

40:56.203 --> 40:57.496
for the other person
to fall apart

40:57.580 --> 41:00.082
-before we help each other out?
-Fine.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.584
-Miss Bowden.
-Shh!

41:01.667 --> 41:04.712
I apologize if we startled you.

41:07.715 --> 41:12.178
We only want to ask about
our good friend, Mrs. Briscoe.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.762
So, let's chat.

41:15.472 --> 41:16.807
-What do we do?
-Okay, shh.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.727
-What are we gonna do?
-Stay. Stay right there.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.062
-Really, what are you doing?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.898
-Hold this.
-Why? I don't want this.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.149
Hold it.

41:26.150 --> 41:29.528
I think if we stay here,
we're gonna be sitting ducks.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.906
I got the...

41:34.366 --> 41:35.868
If there's gas in this thing,

41:35.951 --> 41:37.995
I think I can
create a diversion.

41:39.955 --> 41:42.124
Maybe Davey's little plan
will go wrong

41:42.208 --> 41:43.751
and it'll kill you.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.294
Problem solved.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.089
-Oh, my God, watch your face.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.425
Watch your face.
Watch your face.

41:53.427 --> 41:56.263
-Oh! Oh, my God.
-Okay, run! Run.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.390
-What?
-Come on, come on.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.192
Davey, calm down. We made it.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.069
-I know.
-Listen, I texted Annie

42:10.152 --> 42:11.862
and so she sent me back
a skull and crossbones,

42:11.946 --> 42:13.280
angry face and prayer hands.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.115
-So we're good.
-Okay.

42:15.199 --> 42:18.077
-You all right?
-Uh, um...

42:18.160 --> 42:20.663
You know,
my problems back home,

42:20.746 --> 42:22.790
they don't seem so bad anymore,
so as soon as we land,

42:22.873 --> 42:24.458
I think I'm gonna book
my return flight

42:24.541 --> 42:26.043
to Denver,
if that's okay with you.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.294
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.921
I think I'll be okay
when I get home.

42:29.004 --> 42:30.005
Okay.

42:30.089 --> 42:33.092
LA is now my home.
That's insane.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.888
What is... Does that
have something do with

42:37.972 --> 42:39.348
what North Koreans were after?

42:39.431 --> 42:40.683
Davey, my life is insane.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.142
Not everything is about
the North Koreans.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.560
Keep your voice down.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.813
What's up with the boat
registration numbers?

42:46.897 --> 42:47.898
What?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.191
The boat reg--

42:49.275 --> 42:50.818
When I went on the whale
watching trip with Jenny

42:50.901 --> 42:52.611
and she couldn't stop talking
about her boyfriend,

42:52.695 --> 42:54.571
I went and hung out
on the bridge with the crew,

42:54.655 --> 42:57.533
and I was asking 'em about
the numbers on all the boats.

42:57.616 --> 42:58.826
Boat registration number.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.452
Oh, cool.

43:06.625 --> 43:07.835
Just one...um...

43:07.918 --> 43:09.336
Hey, Shane. Hi. Hi.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.754
Are you still mad at me about
the whole Justin thing?

43:10.838 --> 43:11.880
I'm so sorry.

43:11.964 --> 43:14.341
You better be alone right now.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.801
I'm alone, I'm by myself.

43:15.884 --> 43:18.053
You--Cassie, fuck.

43:18.137 --> 43:20.723
Look, I'm gonna put a brief
moratorium on that conversation.

43:20.806 --> 43:22.808
You've got a bigger problem.

43:22.891 --> 43:26.353
Your handler called me today
to quiz me on you,

43:26.437 --> 43:28.564
and I thought to myself,
"Hmm, that's strange."

43:28.647 --> 43:31.025
And then I saw an internal memo
for a person of interest

43:31.108 --> 43:33.485
in connection with the recent
CIA-related murders.

43:33.569 --> 43:36.572
A blond woman, slim build,
travels internationally.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.532
-Sound familiar?
-Mm, yeah.

43:38.615 --> 43:40.826
-That sounds like me. So, yeah.
-Yeah.

43:40.909 --> 43:44.872
That's a big flashing billboard,
"Find Cassie Bowden."

43:44.955 --> 43:48.083
Shane, I'm just glad that you
believe me and what's going on,

43:48.167 --> 43:49.376
but Dot Karlson
wants me home now,

43:49.460 --> 43:50.836
and she knows
I didn't do any of this.

43:50.919 --> 43:53.505
No, the agency
is not your friend right now.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.050
That guy Benjamin
is poisoning the well.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.343
And even if Dot
is in your corner,

43:57.426 --> 43:58.886
you and I need to meet
before you go

43:58.969 --> 44:00.721
anywhere near the CIA.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.806
Okay, one more thing--
one of the slides

44:02.890 --> 44:05.267
on the View-Master, it's--
it's a boat registration number.

44:05.351 --> 44:06.643
Yeah, I just found out.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.145
If we can find this boat,
maybe we can get ahead

44:08.228 --> 44:09.646
of this whole thing.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.067
You know, it's like just when
I think we're on the same page,

44:13.150 --> 44:15.652
you go and say something
even more bonkers.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.987
Have we met?

44:17.071 --> 44:18.739
Okay, I'm gonna
text it to you, okay?

44:18.822 --> 44:20.074
Okay, bye. Bye.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.993
-I don't want to know, do I?
-Nope.
