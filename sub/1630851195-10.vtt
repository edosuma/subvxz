02:30.859 --> 02:33.695
Breaking news.
After days in limbo, a cruise ship

02:33.779 --> 02:36.823
with at least 21 coronavirus patients
has finally docked.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.534
All on board are facing
federal quarantine.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.495
Washington state
announcing five new deaths just today,

02:41.578 --> 02:44.039
all associated with nursing homes
and long-term care facilities.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.457
The CDC now says

02:45.541 --> 02:49.127
there are more than
420 confirmed cases nationwide…

02:49.211 --> 02:51.713
New York State sets up a containment zone,

02:51.797 --> 02:54.675
and more schools across the country
send students home…

02:54.758 --> 02:56.718
Alex is taking a personal day today.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.722
We are aware of her statements made
at Mitch Kessler's memorial.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.308
We are also aware
that they were filmed surreptitiously

03:03.392 --> 03:04.893
and without consent.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.021
We have heard the public outcry
and appreciate your concern

03:08.105 --> 03:11.233
on behalf of Alex's coworkers
who had contact with her

03:11.316 --> 03:12.943
following her return from Italy.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.905
UBA will be investigating.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.407
If we can get the eyeballs,

03:18.490 --> 03:21.118
I'm telling you,
this event is going to blow minds.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.413
The point of the event
is getting the eyeballs,

03:24.496 --> 03:25.497
getting the subscribers.

03:25.581 --> 03:29.168
Do we have any idea
what it would cost to postpone?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.378
-Jesus.
-We're not postponing.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.131
This is a launch event,
and we launch tomorrow.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.510
I am asking what will it cost
to postpone the whole launch?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.096
If you want those numbers,
we'd have them get into--

03:41.180 --> 03:44.266
Actually, can you all give Cybil and me
a minute alone?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.193
We are not gonna postpone the event.
We are not.

03:54.276 --> 03:58.655
Cory. We see the iceberg.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.034
It doesn't make you brave
to steer the ship right into it.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.327
We're not the Titanic, Cybil.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.370
We're not a luxury liner
across the Atlantic.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.540
We're a rocket ship to the moon, okay?

04:08.624 --> 04:09.750
We're Apollo 13,

04:09.833 --> 04:13.045
if they hadn't whined to Houston
and just landed on the damn moon.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.589
Don't you think
you're more Icarus than Tom Hanks?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.176
We have Tom Hanks.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.554
Why are we gonna cancel the event?
Do you want me to fail?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.640
No, of course not.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.850
I just think you will fail.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.061
The market seems to agree unfortunately.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.231
-The whole market is down.
-Not as much as we are.

04:32.314 --> 04:37.861
People are opening huge short positions
against us. But I am pulling for you.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.864
Then just let me get this off the ground.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.492
If we postpone the launch
and postpone the launch event,

04:43.575 --> 04:45.160
who knows when we'll have another window?

04:45.244 --> 04:46.537
Let me ask you something.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.039
Is this about the streaming service?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.333
Or is it about you?

04:52.584 --> 04:54.044
They are one and the same.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.760
-You're leaving?
-I shouldn't have come in at all.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.929
I'm not gonna risk getting sick

05:04.012 --> 05:07.057
just because
our prized feminist morning anchor

05:07.140 --> 05:08.892
was horny for Chester the Molester.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.937
Not blaming you. You didn't know.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.279
Do we know everyone
who came into contact with her?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.865
It's gonna be
everybody on my show basically.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.324
They're all waiting to hear what to do.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.993
I mean, if Alex even has COVID,

05:26.076 --> 05:28.120
which I'd like to point out
is statistically unlikely.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.539
We've got people threatening
advertiser boycotts.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.915
I'm not sure what to say to anyone

05:31.999 --> 05:35.335
because it's not like
it's just one thing she can apologize for.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.753
Well, after speaking with Doug,

05:36.837 --> 05:38.714
it looks like
Alex is gonna leave on her own.

05:38.797 --> 05:39.798
So--

05:39.882 --> 05:41.717
Actually, can I have everyone hold on?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.304
Hi, Alex.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.682
-Is your head feeling any better?
-You know what?

05:48.765 --> 05:52.644
Thank you. I'm actually--
I'm okay. I'm home.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.400
But I tested positive for COVID.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.568
Shit.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.821
Get everyone home, all of us. Go.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.158
Stella? Did you hear what I said?

06:06.241 --> 06:09.286
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
Is there anything we can do?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.205
I don't think so.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.249
But do I have to announce this?

06:14.333 --> 06:16.460
We need to let people know
that they've been exposed,

06:16.543 --> 06:18.587
but we won't tell them that it was you.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.671
I hope you feel better.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.256
And also, I--

06:23.800 --> 06:25.469
I gotta go,
but we need tests for everyone.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.012
See what's even possible right now.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.681
Stella! Hey!
We have to maintain employee privacy!

06:36.563 --> 06:37.648
What the hell can be going on?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.399
Hi, everyone.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.735
Come together. Can we, please?

06:41.818 --> 06:43.362
Thank you. Quickly, quickly.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.781
All right, yep. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.075
Quickly, quickly. Thank you.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.953
Thank you for your patience.
You should have received an email--

06:51.036 --> 06:54.414
-Someone's got COVID?
-Yes, unfortunately, and we're--

06:54.498 --> 06:57.292
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
-Oh, holy hell.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.711
Does someone have COVID?
Or does Alex have COVID?

06:59.795 --> 07:02.422
We can't divulge
private employee health information.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.507
Alex wasn't in today.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.592
-Bradley wasn't in today.
-It's not Bradley.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.262
Did she have a head injury,
or was she hospitalized because of COVID?

07:08.345 --> 07:09.972
Or did she hit her head because of COVID?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.682
I can't believe she would do this.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.226
-It's pretty damn careless.
-It's not careless. It's malicious.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.395
-We're gonna--
-Are we not asking very strange questions?

07:16.478 --> 07:18.272
Do we not want to wonder
if Alex is gonna be okay?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.274
-Did you know?
-I'm sorry?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.067
Guys, guys, guys!

07:24.278 --> 07:26.613
I see that you have strong emotions,
but for your own safety

07:26.697 --> 07:28.949
and the safety of everybody
who wasn't around this person,

07:29.032 --> 07:30.158
I need for you to go home.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.912
We don't yet know enough
about how this thing is transmitted.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.790
Those of you who can work remotely,
that's what we'll do.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.750
-What does that mean for me?
-We're figuring that out.

07:38.834 --> 07:42.129
We will have a show,
but we don't have all the answers yet.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.423
But this is really about your health.

07:44.965 --> 07:45.966
So for now,

07:46.049 --> 07:49.636
I need for you to go straight home
and wait for further instructions, okay?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.729
Hey, Daniel. I need you a second.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.398
You're going to anchor TMS
for the next few weeks.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.317
From home, at least at first.

08:04.026 --> 08:08.113
-No, I'm not. Is Alex fired?
-Daniel, I can't speak to that.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.823
Or are we waiting
for someone to die first?

08:09.907 --> 08:12.701
Actually, let me put it this way.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.037
If Alex wasn't a pretty white woman--

08:15.120 --> 08:17.664
Daniel, look at me. Look at me.

08:17.748 --> 08:18.749
I see you, Stella.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834
I get that you'd like me
to pick up the pieces for you

08:20.918 --> 08:22.961
because everybody else fucked you over.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.839
But right now,
I gotta take care of my own.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.258
My grandfather is in a home.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.010
He's not safe.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.554
I need to go get him out of there
and bring him back with me.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.058
I gotta find a way to get to LA
and make sure I don't catch this thing,

08:36.140 --> 08:39.144
which means no planes, no hotels.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.312
Do you get the picture?

08:40.395 --> 08:44.149
And good luck to me,
a Black man sleeping in his car.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.234
But I gotta do it.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.737
We can help. Let us help.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.323
But I need you here.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.702
Daniel, I know you felt sidelined,
and that's not okay.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.955
Show us how wrong we were.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.794
If you don't know already,
then you're never gonna know.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.712
And I'm done
trying to prove myself to you.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.757
It's not about proving yourself.
You were in China, use your expertise.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.677
This could be one of
the biggest news stories of our lifetimes.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.929
You're the right person
at the right place.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.224
-People need the news right now.
-Okay. This is the news, okay?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.684
Everyone's carrying around the news.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.436
We're just the news
for people who have too much time.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.732
Daniel, you can't just leave.
You're under contract.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.903
So everybody else can
just do what they want,

09:29.987 --> 09:31.321
but I'm under contract?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.782
Well, not anymore.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.576
I quit.

09:37.411 --> 09:41.206
And by the way, my grandpa thinks
I do have the "it" factor.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.006
You didn't.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.094
-Does Cory know about Alex yet?
-Shit.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.224
Would you consider
upping the trial to six months free?

09:59.308 --> 10:01.310
What about six years, Glen?

10:01.810 --> 10:05.731
-Kyle, what's the rest of my day?
-Last thing you have is--

10:05.814 --> 10:08.609
Paola-- Sorry, I can't pronounce
her last name, in an hour.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.236
-Who?
-Filmmaker. It's a favor to Alex.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.863
I don't have time to do Alex a favor.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.575
Just apologize, get a reel, take a look
at it and let me know if it's any good.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.659
-Got it.
-Thank you.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.453
Cory,
I think we've built something special,

10:19.536 --> 10:21.788
but we knew another streaming service
was gonna be a tough sell.

10:21.872 --> 10:25.083
-What is your point, Glen?
-Maybe we should push.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.171
People are gonna be glued to the news.
News is not UBA+.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.967
-Hey, Stella.
-What up?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.386
You ready for the news onslaught?

10:36.470 --> 10:39.431
Oh, yeah. I was born ready.

10:39.515 --> 10:42.267
I'm excited for Plus. Yeah.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.685
-Good, good.
-Yeah.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.064
We should talk about
doing a collab on a docuseries maybe.

10:47.773 --> 10:51.652
Yeah. That's a great idea.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.362
Let's set up a meeting
in the next little bit.

10:53.445 --> 10:58.951
Glen, would you give Stella and I
a minute alone, please? Thank you.

10:59.785 --> 11:00.786
Yep.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.665
And would you mind getting the door?
Thank you.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.335
Oh, my God.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.712
Well, Jesus. Is she okay?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.130
I don't-- I think so.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.549
I mean, she sounded okay.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.468
God.
If anyone has ever dug their own grave--

11:16.552 --> 11:19.513
-She dug a triple wide.
-Made space for us.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.099
-Yeah. And I-- What?
-Stella…

11:22.182 --> 11:23.475
-Are you a little close?
-What?

11:23.559 --> 11:25.936
Are you a little close? Right now?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.480
-Oh, my God. Fuck. Shit.
-I know. I don't know.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.857
It feels better.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.901
Okay, so,
I guess we have to scrap another statement

11:32.985 --> 11:37.406
and move on to version three of
our response to Alex face-fucks us again.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.532
Who else knows?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.909
Mia knows. HR knows.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.746
-All right.
-Yeah.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.248
We're gonna do that--

11:46.331 --> 11:48.458
We're gonna do the contact tracing,
whatever that is.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.210
-Is that something we do?
-I don't know!

11:50.294 --> 11:52.045
I don't know what that--
What's a contact trace?

11:52.129 --> 11:53.881
Who the fuck knows what that is?
I don't know!

11:53.964 --> 11:55.966
Trying to do all of this by myself.
Nobody knows anything.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.428
Stella, we need to sit on this news
as long as we can.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.639
Yeah. Okay.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.101
I told the whole staff and crew
that we had a positive test.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.230
Everybody assumed.
The whole world will assume.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.648
Reasonable doubt.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.151
She got back from Italy
almost 14 days ago?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.528
If she got it there-- Reckless fool.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.823
But if she got it here, then she is

12:19.907 --> 12:23.202
an unlucky grieving woman
who deserves our sympathy.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.714
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.158
What?

13:04.660 --> 13:05.827
Oh, God.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.581
Oh, shit.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.874
Okay.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.547
Oh, God.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.851
Okay. Gary.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.269
Good afternoon, Ms. Levy.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.605
Gary? Gary, how'd my dog get here?
Where was he?

13:33.689 --> 13:35.232
Charlie Black dropped him by.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.193
He took him home
when you went to the hospital.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.820
You feeling okay?

13:40.445 --> 13:43.448
I'm feeling okay. Better, thanks.

14:31.205 --> 14:34.041
But it's ready to go, right?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.878
There cannot be any outages on launch day.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.508
Yeah, okay.
The rest we can figure out later.

14:43.592 --> 14:46.136
I'm signing off for tonight.
Call me if anything comes up.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.721
Okay.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.524
It's Dr. Botz. How are you doing, Alex?

15:40.607 --> 15:44.027
I'm just awful. I feel awful,
and I don't know what this is,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.863
and I think I should go to the hospital.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.447
Are you having trouble breathing?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.494
No, not really.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.246
Okay. Not really, or no?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.586
-No.
-Then you should stay home.

16:02.671 --> 16:06.258
I am literally on fire
from the inside out.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.302
Tylenol.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.263
And for the breathing, get a spirometer.
It'll help you know.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.223
But if you can breathe,
don't go to the hospital.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.434
All you'd be doing is
putting more people at risk.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.643
There are no treatments yet.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.687
There's not really anything
they can do for you,

16:18.770 --> 16:21.398
unless you need to be intubated
and put on a ventilator.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.026
But you should keep those available
for people who need them.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.174
Mom?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.846
You know you called Chip, right?

17:34.763 --> 17:36.014
I know.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.271
Alex, I heard.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.652
I'm gonna die.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.239
You're not gonna die.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.617
You don't know this.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.454
And I don't wanna be alone.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.795
Okay, well, let's just keep talking.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.965
But I should be sleeping. And I can't.

18:10.716 --> 18:14.553
And I can't. Talking is-- It's too hard.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.809
Then we don't have to.

18:21.685 --> 18:26.231
Put your phone on a pillow or something
right next to you, and…

18:29.234 --> 18:30.569
we can just leave it open.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.905
Really?

18:34.072 --> 18:35.073
Really.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.495
I see.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.372
Oh, God.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.130
Hi.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.887
I don't know
if I'm gonna get through this, Chip.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.681
I really don't know if I can
get through this.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.601
Okay, well, you know, you just…

19:04.228 --> 19:07.689
You need something to focus on, okay?
Can you focus on something else?

19:07.773 --> 19:11.276
Do I focus on my eyes being on fire
or that I'm getting canceled?

19:13.362 --> 19:14.821
It's all I got.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.407
Alex, if I didn't cancel you,

19:18.033 --> 19:20.410
you've at least got a chance
with everyone else.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.787
Did they fire me?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.580
Can you fire a person with COVID?

19:25.123 --> 19:27.292
Well, if I infected everybody--

19:27.376 --> 19:30.671
I mean-- Oh, my God. Who the hell am I?

19:30.754 --> 19:34.299
Alex, do not go down this road, okay?

19:34.383 --> 19:38.387
I promise you, you're just gonna
end up back at original sin.

19:39.054 --> 19:42.140
Look, just close your eyes.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.643
No. No.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.062
It's gonna be okay.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.773
I don't think I'll be able
to close my eyes, but I'll try.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.733
All we can do is try.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.405
I'm not going anywhere.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.115
I'm right here.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.298
Yes, I know. I--

20:15.257 --> 20:16.842
Detective Grant, I get that.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.469
But isn't the first 48 hours
the most important?

20:19.553 --> 20:20.846
Sure, it's obviously better.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.098
Yes, the trail can go cold
after a few days,

20:23.182 --> 20:25.142
but he's a person, not a statistic.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.477
Not yet. Thanks a lot for your time.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.730
…loudly enough
or clearly enough or often enough,

20:29.813 --> 20:33.901
all countries can still change the course
of this pandemic.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.528
Some countries are struggling
with a lack of capacity.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.198
Some countries are struggling
with a lack of resources.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.409
Some countries are struggling
with a lack of resolve.

20:43.327 --> 20:47.206
And that is your eight o'clock news update
for Wednesday, March 11th, 2020.

20:47.873 --> 20:50.417
I never thought that would be
something I'd ever have to say.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.003
"The WHO declares a pandemic."

20:53.086 --> 20:56.089
And today finally marks
the launch of UBA+.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.717
All your favorite shows and stars,
new and classic,

20:58.800 --> 21:01.929
coming to you this evening
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.805
You'll be able to stream everything…

21:23.825 --> 21:25.452
Cory, I gotta talk to you about something.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.704
-Good God.
-Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.081
You want me to reach for the sky?

21:29.164 --> 21:32.292
No, I wanna pitch you a show
with this stupid bandana on my face.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.419
-Can we schedule this?
-It's kinda time-sensitive.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.047
I got a lot of time-sensitive stuff
going on right now, buckaroo.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.423
There's no instruction manual

21:38.507 --> 21:40.259
for doing what I'm doing
during a pandemic.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.135
Nobody knows what's going on
or how to handle this.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.387
That's what this show is.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.222
All right. What? What is the show?

21:45.305 --> 21:48.308
Look, a few hundred people have COVID.
A lot more people are gonna get it.

21:48.392 --> 21:52.354
What could be more informative
or more comforting to a scared nation

21:52.437 --> 21:54.690
than watching Alex get through it?

21:55.274 --> 21:56.567
What if she doesn't get through it?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.736
Cory, she's gonna get through it.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.155
So, I'm guessing
this is a limited-run series, either way?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.700
I mean, she's sick. Now's the time.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.827
And you know what?

22:06.910 --> 22:09.997
It's already being politicized,
and Alex appeals to everyone.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.082
Alex is kinda persona non grata, Chip.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.418
No, no, no. Alex is everyman.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.546
She doesn't always get it right,
but at her core, she's a good person,

22:17.629 --> 22:20.424
and she wants to get it right
before it's all over.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.344
I mean, what is more relatable than that?

22:24.428 --> 22:28.056
This makes it real.
Someone that they know has COVID.

22:28.140 --> 22:32.394
Just give her an hour on UBANC tonight.
She needs this.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.313
But we're not telling people
she has COVID.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.689
We're trying to protect her.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.899
What are we protecting?

22:36.982 --> 22:39.943
She's got COVID. She's--
She's practically canceled.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.653
This is only going one way for her.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.380
-I'm going in. I'm going in.
-Okay.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.425
-What the--
-Yeah.

23:03.509 --> 23:05.552
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah, it's to--

23:05.636 --> 23:08.388
-Fucking kidding me? Who's your guy?
-You know. HR insisted.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.807
-I mean, when's the feeding?
-For the-- You know. You don't--

23:10.891 --> 23:12.142
Do you want my routing number?

23:12.226 --> 23:14.561
-Sorry. I'm just-- This is--
-Just-- Back, back.

23:14.645 --> 23:17.689
Sorry. This is insane. This is crazy.

23:17.773 --> 23:18.815
Look.

23:18.899 --> 23:22.611
You want me to clear
an hour of prime time tonight, for Alex?

23:22.694 --> 23:24.488
I do. The money is already spent on Alex.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.740
Stella,
let's try to get something out of it.

23:27.366 --> 23:32.329
Cory, you're going to lose sponsors
if you put Alex on UBANC.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.456
It doesn't matter
if it's for some altruistic reason

23:34.540 --> 23:36.500
like informing the country about COVID.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.968
Okay. It'll go on UBA+ then.
No sponsors to lose there.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.387
You're not worried about
losing subscribers?

23:48.470 --> 23:51.014
Nobody has subscribed.

23:51.098 --> 23:54.101
So, I'll put on what I wanna put on.
It's Cory+.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.480
I subscribed.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.609
-Anyway.
-Kyle, we got one, okay?

24:03.277 --> 24:04.778
Put it on the Big Board.

24:04.862 --> 24:06.697
-Yes, sir.
-Thanks, Stella.

24:14.997 --> 24:16.039
Lizzy?

24:19.751 --> 24:20.752
Lizzy!

24:22.171 --> 24:24.006
Lizzy, you cannot be in here.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.425
-It's Chip.
-Oh, God.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.468
-Why do you keep thinking I'm a woman?
-Oh, my God.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.846
Oh, my God, Chip.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.809
I have COVID.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

24:35.893 --> 24:38.979
No, Alex. Alex, it's okay. I have COVID.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.315
Sorry, I should've called first.

24:41.398 --> 24:42.733
Oh, no.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.526
No, no.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.654
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.990
No, no, seriously. No, look, look.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.784
-This is fine. I'm fine.
-How do you feel? How are you feeling?

24:52.868 --> 24:55.162
-I actually don't feel that bad, okay?
-Really?

24:55.245 --> 24:57.331
Seriously. I might be asymptomatic, okay?

24:57.414 --> 24:59.249
-I hope so. I so hope so.
-Yeah.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.920
I swear I thought
that's what it was for me too at first,

25:03.003 --> 25:05.506
but then it just-- It hits you.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.633
It's so awful.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.260
But we're gonna--
We'll help each other through.

25:10.344 --> 25:12.471
Yes, that sounds really good.

25:13.972 --> 25:18.227
I also have some good news.
The network wants you on the air tonight.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.525
Are you joking?

25:27.110 --> 25:29.821
-I'm sick.
-I know. That's the point.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.409
So people can just watch me suffer?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.788
Sort of,
but without the sadistic overtones.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.081
No. You know--

25:41.667 --> 25:43.418
-I'm barely hanging on right now.
-No, no.

25:43.502 --> 25:45.504
Like, I'm barely-- I'm barely hanging on.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.256
I understand. But that is the point.

25:47.339 --> 25:50.008
You need something to focus on,
like we discussed. Alex, this is it.

25:51.093 --> 25:52.219
I'm feeling sick.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.430
Alex, I know.
But this show will matter, okay?

25:55.514 --> 25:57.474
Hopefully, show people
they need to take it seriously.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.519
Keep them from getting it. Or if they do,
at least help them get through.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.603
We can help people.

26:01.687 --> 26:02.813
I know. I know.

26:02.896 --> 26:03.939
It sounds a little preachy,

26:04.022 --> 26:06.441
and I don't like doing
the whole rah-rah thing.

26:08.861 --> 26:09.862
Okay.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.449
Save some for the big show.

26:15.242 --> 26:16.368
-It's not funny.
-Sorry.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.583
Oh, God.

26:27.546 --> 26:28.589
Thank you.

26:33.927 --> 26:37.598
Okay. Okay.

26:40.184 --> 26:41.185
Okay.

26:51.403 --> 26:54.531
You're gonna have to leave at 2:15 to ring
the bell at the Stock Exchange at 3:00.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.742
You've got a phoner with Wired at 6:00.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.077
-Your car's picking you up after that…
-What are you looking for?

26:59.161 --> 27:01.496
…to head to MSG for the event.
Denzel's office called.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.207
-He left it here. His favorite--
-Excuse me.

27:04.583 --> 27:05.959
Can I help you?

27:06.043 --> 27:08.128
You canceled our meeting yesterday.

27:08.212 --> 27:11.590
I spoke to your assistant.
He was very rude.

27:11.673 --> 27:12.925
-I just said--
-No.

27:13.008 --> 27:17.554
He said you had to cancel
and to send a sample of my work.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.056
I said I cannot do that,

27:19.139 --> 27:21.934
but I still would like a meeting
before I go back to Italy.

27:22.017 --> 27:26.605
He said no, you're too busy,
to call when I'm back in New York.

27:26.688 --> 27:30.108
So I drove to New Jersey, and I came back.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.278
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I'm on my way out.

27:34.821 --> 27:38.408
-I brought a sample.
-I thought you didn't have a sample.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.244
Yeah, that's what she said. She said--

27:40.327 --> 27:43.872
No. I said I didn't have a sample
I could leave.

27:44.623 --> 27:47.501
-I have to stay and watch it with you.
-He has to leave.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.837
Please, just watch two minutes.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.256
-Do you want me to get security?
-Oh, shut up.

27:52.339 --> 27:55.342
Alex Levy got me a meeting with the CEO.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.052
I never even had a meeting.

27:57.678 --> 28:00.264
So now I want you to watch my work.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.686
Look, I need you to watch this because--

28:08.397 --> 28:09.857
because it's really good.

28:09.940 --> 28:13.610
I watched it again last night,
and I was blown away.

28:15.487 --> 28:16.655
You were blown away?

28:16.738 --> 28:17.781
You're damn right.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.449
And why can't you just leave it?

28:20.117 --> 28:22.452
I can't let it out of my hands.
I promised.

28:25.289 --> 28:26.331
Two minutes.

28:32.129 --> 28:36.675
One year ago, Mitch Kessler
had an audience of six million.

28:36.758 --> 28:40.387
The last two weeks of his life,
he had an audience of one.

28:41.305 --> 28:42.890
I didn't wanna be this person.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.102
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.

28:48.187 --> 28:49.605
I didn't want people to think

28:49.688 --> 28:52.232
I was the kind of person
that could hurt someone.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.781
And now one of those women is dead.
Hannah Shoenfeld.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.755
Hey, Alex. How are you?

29:15.464 --> 29:16.548
Well, you know…

29:17.966 --> 29:19.092
bad.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.178
I'm so sorry to hear that.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.973
It's okay. It's a step up from dead.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.601
It's actually not why I'm calling.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.019
Okay.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.729
I wanted to say thank you.

29:31.563 --> 29:36.193
I asked you to keep your distance from me,
and you certainly did not do that.

29:36.276 --> 29:40.322
And I just-- Means a lot to me.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.909
You can't worry about that right now.
You need to focus on getting better.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.744
Why did you do it?

29:46.328 --> 29:47.704
Because I gave you the job?

29:47.788 --> 29:49.331
No. No, Alex.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.708
I did it because it's true.

29:53.001 --> 29:56.046
And relationships don't have to be
transactional.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.383
I did it because we're friends.

30:00.384 --> 30:02.970
Not good ones, but important ones.

30:03.554 --> 30:07.558
But good ones isn't out of the question.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.226
I'd like that.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.521
I'll do better.

30:15.357 --> 30:16.984
You're too good for me, Bradley.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.237
Please, I'm just as disappointing
as everybody else.

30:20.946 --> 30:21.947
What do you mean?

30:23.907 --> 30:27.995
Well, when I dumped
my brother off at rehab,

30:28.078 --> 30:30.247
I told him that I was done with him.

30:30.330 --> 30:33.625
He wasn't going in, and I said,
"Go in if you want to."

30:33.709 --> 30:36.962
But I left him there,
and now he's missing.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.297
Well, where is he?

30:38.380 --> 30:40.465
Alex, I don't know. He's missing.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.594
He came back to the city
a couple of days ago,

30:43.677 --> 30:46.305
and I just don't know where he is.

30:46.388 --> 30:47.890
And I don't even know if he's alive.

30:47.973 --> 30:49.850
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

30:49.933 --> 30:54.062
I've been off social for obvious reasons,
but it--

30:54.563 --> 30:58.442
Do you need me to retweet anything?

31:00.736 --> 31:02.070
I didn't post about it.

31:02.988 --> 31:03.989
What?

31:04.865 --> 31:06.825
I know, I know. It's just--

31:07.993 --> 31:10.787
Look, you weren't there that--
My brother is--

31:12.206 --> 31:15.375
My brother's having a really hard time,
and it's my family.

31:15.459 --> 31:17.336
Oh, come on, Bradley. Stop it.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.963
Families are fucked up.

31:20.047 --> 31:23.383
You know why they're fucked up?
Because they're full of people.

31:24.259 --> 31:25.594
If you wanna cut somebody off,

31:25.677 --> 31:27.346
then just cut them off
and be done with it.

31:27.429 --> 31:30.474
But if that is not an option, then…

31:32.851 --> 31:34.144
you've gotta own them.

31:35.354 --> 31:37.105
I think it's why you stuck up for me,

31:37.189 --> 31:39.274
because you're owning me and my shit.

31:40.442 --> 31:46.281
Don't let your shame of
what other people think run your life.

31:48.158 --> 31:49.159
I know. You're right.

31:49.243 --> 31:50.619
I'm always right. God.

31:50.702 --> 31:51.828
Finally.

31:54.456 --> 31:57.793
All right, I have to go.
I just wore myself out yelling at you.

31:57.876 --> 32:00.838
Well, thank you for using
your energy for that.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.965
And listen,
I'm not gonna stop calling you.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.967
I'm really worried about you.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.051
Thank you.

32:22.067 --> 32:25.320
My brother, Hal Jackson,
has been missing for two days.

32:26.154 --> 32:28.699
He was last seen
somewhere in New York City.

32:29.533 --> 32:31.994
The New York police know. They're aware.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.663
But I've been looking
in all the hospitals,

32:34.746 --> 32:38.333
and… I just--
I haven't been able to find him.

32:40.586 --> 32:43.213
I've just been exhausting myself
trying to look for him, and I--

32:43.297 --> 32:45.007
It's really, particularly concerning

32:45.090 --> 32:48.177
because of everything that's going on
in the world right now.

32:50.012 --> 32:54.433
His safety is just
the most important thing to me right now.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.436
This is what he looks like.

33:05.152 --> 33:07.154
If you see him,
will you tell him that I love him,

33:07.237 --> 33:09.239
and I just want him to come back safe?

33:10.324 --> 33:13.327
Or you can also DM me
if you have any information.

33:14.494 --> 33:15.913
There's a hotline below.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.417
Just please let me know
if anybody has seen him.

33:20.501 --> 33:21.668
I--

33:22.503 --> 33:24.671
He's just a really--
He's a really good person.

33:24.755 --> 33:28.091
He's just really struggling right now.
So, I need your help.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.721
And I really hope to see you soon
at The Morning Show again.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.350
And I want everybody to stay safe.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.644
Please, everybody.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.620
This really is very good.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.665
That's what I said, isn't it?

33:59.748 --> 34:02.292
You did. Congratulations.

34:02.376 --> 34:04.670
I just want a job.

34:04.753 --> 34:07.798
Documentary, doing news pieces. I'm open.

34:07.881 --> 34:12.302
I understand, but I think there may be
an audience for your documentary.

34:12.386 --> 34:13.804
I'm sure there is,

34:14.679 --> 34:17.724
but I'm not gonna betray him.

34:17.808 --> 34:20.393
I do not think
you would be betraying him--

34:20.476 --> 34:21.478
I promised him.

34:21.562 --> 34:25.774
I could have done something
that good before I met him,

34:25.858 --> 34:27.025
but I didn't.

34:27.525 --> 34:28.735
So I owe him.

34:28.819 --> 34:31.154
-Cory, you--
-Kyle, I need another minute.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.197
Okay, but you have to go
back to the Archer Gray,

34:33.282 --> 34:35.784
and if you don't go now,
you'll be late to Madison Square Garden.

34:35.868 --> 34:37.536
Okay, got it. Thanks.

34:37.619 --> 34:38.620
Listen.

34:40.414 --> 34:43.833
Mitch didn't say anything in there
that doesn't make me think he wasn't--

34:43.917 --> 34:46.043
Well, I'm just gonna say it, a scumbag.

34:46.128 --> 34:52.050
But maybe, maybe,
the very existence of your documentary,

34:52.134 --> 34:53.760
and what it did for you…

34:55.094 --> 34:58.807
is a living monument
for humanity's capacity for good.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.147
Anyway, food for thought.

35:06.106 --> 35:07.107
I gotta go.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.276
You've got my number.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.202
Mamma mia.

35:25.501 --> 35:26.835
Oh, my God.

35:47.689 --> 35:48.690
Yeah!

35:48.774 --> 35:50.317
Vitamin cocktail goes here.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.653
-Oh, my God. Please, Chip.
-Sorry. What?

36:13.298 --> 36:14.800
Fuck.

36:16.051 --> 36:17.052
Okay.

36:18.720 --> 36:19.805
God.

36:22.057 --> 36:25.561
Okay.

36:25.644 --> 36:27.604
There's nothing taking this away.

36:32.401 --> 36:34.319
-Streaming in three, Chip.
-Oh, shit.

36:34.403 --> 36:37.364
Okay, Alex, we are live in three minutes.
Come on. Let's do this.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.449
-Good to go here.
-Ready.

36:40.909 --> 36:41.910
Oh, shit.

36:42.494 --> 36:45.581
-What do you mean, "Oh, shit"? What?
-Take that shit. Fuck.

36:45.664 --> 36:49.126
It's not that bad. Don't tell me
you're not up for this, please. Please.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.336
No, I'm not, but isn't that the point?

36:51.420 --> 36:54.131
Who's gonna be watching this,
by the way? What do I mean?

36:54.214 --> 36:55.674
Everybody's gonna wanna watch me die.

36:55.757 --> 36:57.759
No one wants to watch you die.
Just sit. Nope.

36:57.843 --> 37:00.637
You have no idea
how mean people are, Chip. Swear to God.

37:00.721 --> 37:02.764
-What they say is unbelievable.
-Gonna put this wire on you.

37:02.848 --> 37:04.766
-Hands are a little cold. Sorry.
-I love the cold.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.226
Please, cold. Love it for a second.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.437
-Two minutes.
-I'll show you my tweets.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.480
-The people say things--
-Those people are mean.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.316
-We don't care about them, okay?
-All right.

37:12.399 --> 37:14.276
-They don't know you.
-Well, neither do I.

37:14.359 --> 37:17.112
-Shit. That's not helping.
-Yes, you do. And you're gonna tell them.

37:17.196 --> 37:18.322
Guess what? You got this, okay?

37:18.405 --> 37:20.240
-Jesus, relax.
-Okay. Come on!

37:21.241 --> 37:23.452
Okay, give me a quick level check, please.

37:24.912 --> 37:26.288
Oh, God.

37:26.371 --> 37:28.707
I hope I don't die doing this.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.709
Okay, level sounds good.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.419
Also, you're not gonna die, not right now.

37:32.503 --> 37:35.130
Chip, honestly, I really feel like
I'm having trouble breathing.

37:35.214 --> 37:37.674
It's just nerves. I get it. It's fine.

37:38.467 --> 37:41.011
It's not nerves. It's fucking COVID.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.680
Alex,
you're gonna have to trust me on this.

37:43.764 --> 37:46.391
Read the copy I wrote.
Be yourself. You're gonna be great.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.768
One minute, we're live.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.526
Hey, no, don't drink that.
Don't drink that shit.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.570
Excuse me?
Do you want me to get through this?

37:58.654 --> 38:02.074
Because I need help. And saying,
"Just be yourself" is not doing it.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.409
There she is, America's sweetheart.

38:04.493 --> 38:07.788
-Cue the music. Roll A.
-All right, here we go. Here we go. Ready?

38:07.871 --> 38:14.002
-Oh, God.
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

38:14.086 --> 38:16.964
It's gonna be awesome. Four, three…

38:17.047 --> 38:18.048
Oh, God.

38:21.802 --> 38:23.595
Good m-- Welcome.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.974
I'm so used to saying, "Good morning,"
but it's not morning.

38:27.057 --> 38:29.935
Or maybe it is where you're watching this.

38:30.018 --> 38:32.437
That is the beauty of streaming.

38:32.521 --> 38:37.526
But actually, for the last day or so,
time has had no meaning at all for me.

38:38.026 --> 38:41.280
One moment, 2:00 in the afternoon.
Next moment, 1:00 at night.

38:42.197 --> 38:46.368
I find myself on something…
of a strange journey.

38:46.451 --> 38:51.081
A journey that, unfortunately,
many people either have already

38:51.164 --> 38:52.958
or soon will embark upon.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.502
Because I learned
the difficult news yesterday

38:55.586 --> 38:59.840
that I tested positive
for the novel coronavirus.

39:00.716 --> 39:04.928
I hope you'll join me
from a safe and streaming distance

39:05.012 --> 39:06.388
as we talk about it.

39:07.347 --> 39:09.391
You got it. You got it.
Just follow the script.

39:11.727 --> 39:15.397
I wish I could tell you
I wasn't scared, but I am.

39:17.107 --> 39:23.071
Already my symptoms are more excruciating
than anything I've ever experienced.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.576
And I don't say that--
I really don't say that to scare you.

39:27.659 --> 39:31.205
But if that's what it takes
for people to take this seriously,

39:31.288 --> 39:33.916
then I'm happy to scare
the hell out of all of you.

39:34.875 --> 39:40.422
But my main concern is what I may have
put on my coworkers.

39:41.882 --> 39:44.927
That is hurting me
more than anything a virus can do.

39:48.805 --> 39:52.226
Really, I'm very sorry
for how this all played out.

39:52.309 --> 39:54.728
But in my defense,
and maybe it doesn't matter,

39:54.811 --> 39:59.650
I was tested after I returned from Italy
and received a negative result.

39:59.733 --> 40:03.946
But they're telling us that
the incubation period is up to 14 days,

40:04.029 --> 40:07.658
and I really-- I don't know
if I even got it there.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.243
I don't-- I don't know.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.454
But I have to take
responsibility nonetheless.

40:12.538 --> 40:17.584
I owe a particularly big apology
to my producer, Charlie Black,

40:19.294 --> 40:21.630
who has tested positive for COVID himself.

40:23.048 --> 40:26.468
But he's a fighter
who most definitely has a spine.

40:28.136 --> 40:29.471
One of the best spines out there.

40:30.639 --> 40:31.807
Fuck.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.601
And I know he's gonna make it through.

40:37.813 --> 40:41.066
You're listening to 96.8 WLFN,

40:41.149 --> 40:44.778
Cincinnati's only all-music,
all the time station.

40:44.862 --> 40:48.365
I'm Dennis.
I'll be spinning until the sun comes up.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.450
Here's Mark Mallman.

40:57.958 --> 40:58.959
Hey, Mia.

40:59.918 --> 41:01.795
Hey! How's your grandfather?

41:01.879 --> 41:03.422
One of the nurses is sick.

41:05.048 --> 41:06.967
-Don't know with what.
-So sorry to hear that.

41:07.050 --> 41:08.760
How long until you're--

41:08.844 --> 41:10.888
A few days. I'm only in Ohio.

41:11.513 --> 41:13.182
Well, about yesterday--

41:13.265 --> 41:14.933
Honestly,
I really don't wanna talk about it.

41:15.017 --> 41:18.145
I'm really not at peace
with the situation,

41:18.979 --> 41:20.397
but I'm at peace with my decision.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.607
Daniel, I hear that.

41:21.690 --> 41:24.318
But I wanna talk about
what went down. It was--

41:24.401 --> 41:29.948
Mia, can we just be friends
and not talk about work for once?

41:30.032 --> 41:31.366
How you holding up?

41:34.745 --> 41:38.582
Daniel, all I do is work. I don't have
things to talk about that aren't work.

41:38.665 --> 41:42.544
But having you here makes it bearable, so…

41:44.338 --> 41:46.048
I really need you to come back.

41:47.216 --> 41:48.842
Okay. Well, that's very sweet,

41:48.926 --> 41:50.344
and very stupid,

41:50.427 --> 41:52.012
and very much appreciated, but…

41:53.096 --> 41:54.097
I quit.

41:54.848 --> 41:56.016
I'm not coming back.

41:56.099 --> 41:58.310
Is it that you can't,
or you don't want to?

41:58.393 --> 42:00.854
Both. Not the way things are.

42:00.938 --> 42:03.190
I gotta start building
my own opportunities.

42:03.690 --> 42:08.362
Otherwise, I'll just keep languishing,
waiting for a seat at their table,

42:09.196 --> 42:10.989
when I can make a table of my own.

42:11.823 --> 42:13.742
Otherwise,
we'll all just keep languishing.

42:13.825 --> 42:15.536
Okay, Daniel. Here's my pitch.

42:17.538 --> 42:19.122
I get why you left The Morning Show,

42:19.206 --> 42:20.958
and if you come back
it's not gonna get easier

42:21.041 --> 42:23.752
because The Morning Show is broken.

42:23.836 --> 42:25.003
I get that.

42:25.504 --> 42:27.506
The night
before Maggie Brener's excerpt came out,

42:27.589 --> 42:30.384
I didn't sleep.
I thought-- I did the math,

42:30.467 --> 42:33.595
and I figured out that it doesn't matter
where you go as a Black person.

42:34.096 --> 42:35.556
You're gonna deal with some bullshit.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.267
It's fucked up, but it's true.

42:38.350 --> 42:40.435
And you could leave, but right now,

42:41.144 --> 42:44.773
right now, so many people will benefit

42:44.857 --> 42:48.569
by you sitting in the chair
that Alex Levy takes for granted.

42:48.652 --> 42:54.867
Your face as the lead anchor on the most
valuable news asset at UBA will mean

42:54.950 --> 42:56.535
more than you could ever imagine.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.620
No one is offering me that seat.

42:58.704 --> 43:00.581
You think it's gonna be different
someplace else?

43:00.664 --> 43:02.165
It's fucked up everywhere.

43:03.876 --> 43:05.836
We are here now.

43:06.837 --> 43:09.923
We can keep pushing. We can keep pushing.

43:11.633 --> 43:12.885
Please don't give up on that.

43:12.968 --> 43:16.513
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

43:16.597 --> 43:19.641
Tomorrow will come, someday.

43:19.725 --> 43:21.351
Well, that remains to be seen.

43:25.189 --> 43:26.773
Thanks, Mia. I'll call you.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.693
Wait. Wait. I wanna hear from Grandpa.

43:32.070 --> 43:34.072
Okay. All right. Bye.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.240
Bye.

43:36.533 --> 43:37.659
And thank you, Mia.

43:37.743 --> 43:39.328
It means the world to me.

43:43.415 --> 43:44.416
Bye.

43:50.214 --> 43:53.425
Right now, I feel like--

43:54.134 --> 43:57.012
like I'm cooking, you know,
from the inside out.

43:59.681 --> 44:03.852
In my body trying to kill this virus,
it's gonna kill me too.

44:04.436 --> 44:07.940
And the hotter I get,
the more I feel out of my body.

44:09.816 --> 44:14.238
A million more symptoms,
but I'm not gonna get into all of them.

44:14.321 --> 44:17.783
And at this point,
there's really no treatment.

44:17.866 --> 44:21.620
I called my doctor,
a great doctor, Dr. Vincent Botz,

44:21.703 --> 44:25.374
and he told me to get a spirometer,

44:26.333 --> 44:31.880
and he said unless I really,
really can't breathe that…

44:32.923 --> 44:35.008
I just have to stay home and suck it up.

44:36.426 --> 44:40.264
So in short, it's hell.

44:45.394 --> 44:46.562
Yeah?

44:46.645 --> 44:49.857
Cory, it's Glen.
I have Brian conferenced in with me here.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.525
Hey, what's going on?

44:52.025 --> 44:54.570
I just got word from Australia.

44:55.487 --> 44:57.531
Tom and Rita have COVID.

44:58.365 --> 44:59.825
Oh, shit.

45:03.370 --> 45:04.371
All right…

45:05.914 --> 45:07.124
Okay, so what do we do?

45:07.207 --> 45:10.127
Well, we could go on
from our other locations,

45:10.210 --> 45:12.296
but people are getting skittish.

45:12.379 --> 45:14.590
He's being kind. People are freaked out.

45:14.673 --> 45:16.967
For Christ's sake,
it's Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.969
If they can get it, no one feels safe.

45:19.052 --> 45:21.221
Brian, tell him
what Peter Bullard said to you.

45:21.763 --> 45:24.016
He said there was
no way in hell he was coming.

45:24.099 --> 45:26.310
They just canceled the Jazz/Thunder game.

45:26.393 --> 45:29.188
My buddy in Adam Silver's office says
they're shutting down indefinitely.

45:29.271 --> 45:32.149
Is it safe to do this event?

45:32.649 --> 45:33.901
I don't feel comfortable.

45:33.984 --> 45:36.195
All the people gathered
at these places, I mean…

45:38.822 --> 45:39.865
Shut 'em down.

45:42.618 --> 45:44.036
Glen, you'll put out a release.

45:44.536 --> 45:45.704
Of course.

46:15.067 --> 46:18.820
Hey, everybody.
I know that you haven't seen me

46:18.904 --> 46:20.572
for the past couple of days
on Morning Show.

46:21.823 --> 46:26.286
And, you know, we try to share
as much of our personal lives as we can.

46:26.370 --> 46:29.456
And so now, that spiky little fucker--

46:29.540 --> 46:31.208
-Can I say that?
-You just did.

46:31.291 --> 46:36.505
That spiky little fucker is
in a race with you, the American people,

46:36.588 --> 46:37.798
to see who can cancel me first.

46:37.881 --> 46:42.344
You know where my money is? My money
is on the spiky little fucker, that--

46:42.845 --> 46:44.388
Corona piece of shit.

46:47.140 --> 46:49.935
Because they're real.
That's real. That's--

46:54.982 --> 46:56.275
-Hey.
-Hey.

46:56.358 --> 46:58.569
I saw your post. I'm here to help.

46:58.652 --> 47:02.322
Oh, yeah. I--
Shouldn't you be at your event?

47:02.406 --> 47:04.783
You didn't hear? Canceled.

47:05.617 --> 47:07.536
I was getting ready to go now.

47:08.412 --> 47:09.413
I'll join you.

47:10.163 --> 47:13.333
Okay.

47:14.293 --> 47:18.505
But the legions of people
who want me gone? They're not real.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.592
Those people are not real.

47:21.675 --> 47:24.428
Maggie Brener's book is gonna sell what,
like…

47:25.929 --> 47:29.933
I don't know,
30,000, 40,000 if she's lucky.

47:32.519 --> 47:33.770
But I'm meant to believe that

47:33.854 --> 47:37.024
the whole world is gonna be
outraged about my behavior.

47:38.650 --> 47:41.361
Right! I believe that.

47:42.321 --> 47:44.489
Okay, we're cuing Fauci clip.

47:44.573 --> 47:47.034
That was really, really fucking good.

47:47.117 --> 47:50.579
…what you see now in an uncontained way,

47:50.662 --> 47:53.707
and although we are containing it
in some respects,

47:53.790 --> 47:57.628
we keep getting people coming in
from the country that are travel related.

47:59.505 --> 48:01.507
Oh, shit! Chip.

48:01.590 --> 48:03.425
-…when you get community spread…
-Fuck.

48:03.509 --> 48:05.928
…it makes the challenge much greater.

48:09.389 --> 48:10.390
Oh, God.

48:11.058 --> 48:14.019
Chip, I'm gonna need a fan. I'm on fire.

48:14.603 --> 48:16.313
Can you elaborate?

48:16.396 --> 48:19.566
The seasonal flu
that we deal with every year…

48:19.650 --> 48:20.984
Hey, this is Charlie Black.

48:21.068 --> 48:23.737
Hi, Charlie.
This is Marcy from Titanium Health.

48:23.820 --> 48:25.781
We finally got
a new batch of COVID tests in.

48:25.864 --> 48:27.491
Or did you find one somewhere else?

48:27.574 --> 48:28.784
No, I didn't.

48:28.867 --> 48:30.661
Great. Let me schedule one for you.

48:31.245 --> 48:33.747
Actually, you know, I don't need it.

48:34.540 --> 48:36.250
I'm confused. Did you get tested?

48:36.750 --> 48:39.086
Yes, I did. I'm negative.

48:39.169 --> 48:40.379
At least, I was.

48:41.338 --> 48:42.589
Thank you anyway.

48:42.673 --> 48:45.425
…brings the mortality rate
down to somewhere around 1%,

48:46.093 --> 48:50.764
which means it is ten times
more lethal than the seasonal flu.

48:50.848 --> 48:53.642
Ten times more lethal than the flu.

48:54.184 --> 48:57.396
Yes. What Dr. Fauci says
seems to be accurate.

48:57.479 --> 49:00.482
You never like to say this,
but many people will die.

49:07.197 --> 49:08.991
Are you afraid of dying?

49:09.074 --> 49:10.492
Afraid of dying from COVID?

49:10.576 --> 49:12.870
No, just afraid of dying.

49:12.953 --> 49:17.666
COVID, heart attack,
hunting accident, anything?

49:18.625 --> 49:20.586
I think it's natural
to be afraid of death.

49:21.753 --> 49:25.883
No. Are you afraid?
You personally, are you afraid of dying?

49:25.966 --> 49:27.551
I wouldn't say "afraid," no.

49:27.634 --> 49:31.305
As a doctor of infectious disease,
you learn to come to terms with death.

49:33.974 --> 49:36.768
What do you think happens… when we die?

49:36.852 --> 49:39.062
Do you believe that
we carry on in any way?

49:40.898 --> 49:44.526
Well, medically, it's currently unknown.

49:45.986 --> 49:49.364
But I do have faith,
and I believe this is not the end.

49:51.867 --> 49:53.702
Yeah, see, I don't think we go anywhere.

49:53.785 --> 49:56.914
I mean, if you have faith,
death shouldn't be scary.

49:57.581 --> 49:59.708
What I think
when we die is that that's it.

50:00.709 --> 50:02.628
That's so scary, you know.

50:04.630 --> 50:06.507
It's scary to be faced with something

50:06.590 --> 50:12.304
that is just beyond the mind
to understand.

50:14.097 --> 50:17.935
What does it feel like
to not even know nothingness?

50:18.018 --> 50:21.313
But you can't even feel that
because it's just, like…

50:22.648 --> 50:24.233
it's the absence of anything.

50:24.316 --> 50:25.734
The world does go on.

50:26.235 --> 50:27.236
I don't think so.

50:27.319 --> 50:30.280
I think the world will stop existing
when I die.

50:34.785 --> 50:38.121
I know everyone already thinks that
I'm self-centered, and, yeah, I am.

50:39.331 --> 50:42.668
Is there anyone out there
who is perceiving the world

50:42.751 --> 50:44.753
from somewhere other than
inside their own body?

50:44.837 --> 50:50.133
Beyond that, it's a matter of faith for me
to even believe that you exist, Peja.

50:50.217 --> 50:53.512
Well, I do exist, Alex.
I mean, this I know.

50:54.221 --> 50:55.722
I don't know, Peja.

50:55.806 --> 50:57.599
I hope you do. I really do.

50:59.101 --> 51:01.186
I think all you can do is act like…

51:03.063 --> 51:04.815
you believe it matters.

51:04.898 --> 51:07.818
You know, treat people
like you'd like to be treated

51:09.027 --> 51:10.904
and hope that it matters.

51:12.155 --> 51:16.869
Hope that you're wrong about
there being no next plane of existence.

51:18.245 --> 51:21.248
Hope you can reach enlightenment
and know the unknowable.

51:22.207 --> 51:23.417
And stop being…

51:24.751 --> 51:25.752
afraid.

51:25.836 --> 51:28.380
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Have you seen that man?

51:29.006 --> 51:31.216
Have you seen this man? He's my brother.

51:31.300 --> 51:34.178
If you see him, will you call
the number on the sheet? Thank you.

51:34.261 --> 51:35.470
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

51:35.554 --> 51:37.556
Cory, I don't know what to do.
He's not here.

51:37.639 --> 51:40.934
I feel like I've looked in every alley,
every street. I don't know what to do.

51:41.018 --> 51:43.020
-You'll find him.
-I'm starting to get hopeless.

51:43.103 --> 51:44.688
Don't. Don't.

51:44.771 --> 51:46.732
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
-Fuck.

51:46.815 --> 51:48.734
-Just take a breath, a big--
-God.

51:50.152 --> 51:52.362
-Laura's in Montana? Okay, super.
-Yes.

51:52.446 --> 51:54.615
-Right.
-Shit. It's probably best she's not here.

51:54.698 --> 51:55.699
She's--

51:56.325 --> 51:57.910
She thinks my family's crazy.

51:57.993 --> 51:59.745
She just doesn't like chaos.

51:59.828 --> 52:02.122
And… I don't know.

52:02.206 --> 52:03.498
I miss her though.

52:04.333 --> 52:05.834
I wish she could help.

52:07.252 --> 52:08.253
Fuck, I--

52:08.337 --> 52:11.131
Bradley, I have to tell you something.
This is terrible timing.

52:11.215 --> 52:12.758
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

52:12.841 --> 52:15.219
It's been eating at me.
It's something that I did,

52:15.302 --> 52:17.804
and I feel-- I'm not happy that I did it.

52:17.888 --> 52:21.058
It seemed like a means
to a justifiable end at the time.

52:21.141 --> 52:23.977
But now this pandemic has hit,
everything seems… totally different.

52:24.061 --> 52:26.063
All the things I thought were
really important--

52:26.146 --> 52:27.314
You know, like--

52:27.397 --> 52:29.566
I had things I had to win at
or die trying, you know?

52:29.650 --> 52:31.902
I may have just lost
a company a billion dollars. Oops.

52:31.985 --> 52:34.446
It all seems irrelevant,
and I just feel like I have this need--

52:34.530 --> 52:36.198
That I gotta go to confession

52:36.281 --> 52:38.325
and get my soul straight
with you about this--

52:38.408 --> 52:40.994
-You don't have to confess to me.
-It's about you.

52:43.413 --> 52:44.748
I trust you.

52:51.046 --> 52:52.297
I love you.

52:54.216 --> 52:55.259
It--

52:57.427 --> 52:59.137
I don't know what that means really.

52:59.221 --> 53:03.183
I had this feeling--
I'm not able to identify it exactly,

53:03.267 --> 53:04.810
or give it a name.

53:04.893 --> 53:08.272
But I have this sixth sense that it is…

53:09.898 --> 53:10.899
I love you.

53:12.484 --> 53:14.695
So, do with that what--

53:14.778 --> 53:15.904
You know what? Fuck it.

53:15.988 --> 53:18.824
I want that recorded
in the annals of time.

53:18.907 --> 53:23.704
I don't know what's gonna happen, okay?
Now the universe knows that I said that.

53:26.331 --> 53:27.499
I really love you.

53:29.126 --> 53:30.127
I love you.

53:41.430 --> 53:42.764
Oh, shoot.

53:44.850 --> 53:45.851
Hi, this is Bradley.

53:45.934 --> 53:48.353
Hello. I'm a nurse at Antioch Hospital.

53:48.437 --> 53:49.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:49.521 --> 53:52.524
I shouldn't be doing this,
but I saw your post.

53:52.608 --> 53:56.236
We have a patient without ID
who I think is your brother.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.988
You should get down here soon.

53:58.071 --> 53:59.907
-Oh, my God. Okay, thank you.
-What?

53:59.990 --> 54:01.992
Come on. We gotta go.
They found my brother.

54:02.075 --> 54:03.744
During the course of this broadcast,

54:03.827 --> 54:06.038
my fever has gone up quite a lot.

54:06.121 --> 54:10.834
And I know there's those of you out there
who would be saying I deserve this.

54:10.918 --> 54:13.921
"You deserve this, Alex Levy."

54:14.004 --> 54:16.715
And, you know, you might be right.
I don't know. You probably are.

54:17.257 --> 54:20.886
But my response to you is,
what's your point?

54:22.554 --> 54:27.142
Is it that if I deserve it,
it allows you to enjoy someone else's pain

54:27.226 --> 54:28.685
while feeling morally righteous?

54:29.269 --> 54:32.814
And by the way, the world's not fair.
Fair is just a man-made concept.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.943
So why do you have this opinion?

54:36.026 --> 54:37.861
Why do you have an opinion on this?

54:40.405 --> 54:41.698
Mind your own store.

54:53.836 --> 54:58.173
Did I bring this scrutiny on myself
by putting myself in the public eye?

55:01.343 --> 55:03.512
I mean, I-- You know, I--

55:04.680 --> 55:07.224
I know that makes sense
to some of you, but…

55:09.726 --> 55:10.727
Jesus.

55:12.479 --> 55:13.856
Just remember…

55:15.649 --> 55:18.402
I was a kid like anyone else.

55:20.320 --> 55:23.490
I took my first steps like anyone else.

55:24.408 --> 55:28.245
Had my first love, my first heartbreak.

55:36.211 --> 55:41.717
I just had the audacity to wanna be on TV
and try to entertain and inform you.

55:43.468 --> 55:46.471
What? Why would-- So stupid.

55:47.014 --> 55:50.934
I didn't realize when I made that choice

55:51.018 --> 55:55.397
that the thing people would find
most entertaining is not even

55:55.480 --> 55:57.858
the thing that I do that I'm good at.

55:59.026 --> 56:03.197
That I'm-- have risen
to the highest levels of.

56:03.280 --> 56:06.366
I didn't realize that the most
entertaining thing about me would be

56:06.450 --> 56:09.453
just batting me around
like a freaking piñata

56:09.536 --> 56:13.707
while… digging around,
asking questions about my sex life.

56:14.333 --> 56:16.627
God, why do I even bother doing the news?

56:16.710 --> 56:18.587
Who's your tailor sleeping with?

56:19.838 --> 56:21.006
Is he a good guy?

56:24.218 --> 56:25.928
Does it matter if your pants fit?

56:28.138 --> 56:31.808
I'm done apologizing for myself.

56:37.105 --> 56:40.776
Either get on the Alex Levy train,
or just stay at the station.

56:41.693 --> 56:43.445
Can I get some assistance, please?

56:43.529 --> 56:45.489
-Yes, what?
-Man, what's with the wait?

56:45.572 --> 56:47.950
-I mean, come on.
-Yes.

56:48.033 --> 56:49.910
Would I be waiting this long
if I had insurance?

56:49.993 --> 56:53.121
I told you that has nothing to do with
the wait time. We're grossly understaffed.

56:53.205 --> 56:55.332
-Sorry, we need your assistance.
-I'll be with right you.

56:55.415 --> 56:56.834
-I was here first.
-I understand.

56:56.917 --> 56:58.085
She needs to find her brother.

56:58.168 --> 57:01.088
We have new visitor restrictions,
but I will help you when it's your turn.

57:01.171 --> 57:02.840
I don't think you understand.
Somebody called and said

57:02.923 --> 57:04.883
he's in the emergency room,
and I don't know if it's him.

57:04.967 --> 57:06.969
I have to see him
to see if it's really him.

57:07.052 --> 57:09.596
I need you to wait.
Wait or leave. Those are the choices.

57:09.680 --> 57:14.142
Hey. If my wife didn't have COVID before,
she probably has it now.

57:14.226 --> 57:15.894
I mean, we've been here forever!

57:15.978 --> 57:17.729
-This is ridiculous!
-Sir, I will get to you--

57:56.685 --> 57:58.979
-Excuse me. What are you doing?
-I'm looking for my brother.

57:59.062 --> 58:01.899
No, you can't be here.
You have to leave.

58:02.649 --> 58:04.651
-Get security!
-Hal!

58:08.989 --> 58:12.284
I didn't use.
I swear to God, Bradley. I didn't use.

58:12.367 --> 58:14.203
Thank God you're okay.

58:15.662 --> 58:17.915
-What happened?
-I got in a fight.

58:18.957 --> 58:20.000
I got beat up.

58:20.083 --> 58:22.753
I'm so mad at you,
but I'm glad you're okay.

58:26.757 --> 58:30.385
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm not gonna leave you, okay?

58:31.053 --> 58:32.221
I promise.

58:37.392 --> 58:38.435
I love you, B.

58:42.272 --> 58:45.317
You motherfucker.
You scared the shit out of me!

58:47.819 --> 58:49.446
God.

59:00.749 --> 59:03.794
I think we can all agree that
the world seems to be at a turning point,

59:03.877 --> 59:08.757
and life right now is presenting me
with some adversity.

59:10.551 --> 59:13.428
I'm looking inward and asking myself

59:13.512 --> 59:15.305
who is it that I actually wanna be?

59:16.640 --> 59:18.392
And then I'm looking in the mirror,

59:18.475 --> 59:21.186
and I'm asking if that's actually
who I am.

59:22.563 --> 59:25.941
I think a lot of people are going
to be doing that.

59:26.024 --> 59:27.359
At least, they should be.

59:29.570 --> 59:32.656
The world's never gonna be
finished piling on.

59:32.739 --> 59:35.158
Shit's always gonna be coming at you.

59:36.577 --> 59:40.497
But life is-- It's life, you know?

59:40.581 --> 59:41.748
And I'm alive.

59:42.291 --> 59:43.959
I mean, at least I think I'm alive.

59:44.042 --> 59:45.127
I really--

59:45.669 --> 59:46.879
Stay tuned.

59:46.962 --> 59:50.340
And, you know,
if you're watching this and--

59:51.008 --> 59:52.718
Maybe-- I hope you're alive too.

59:55.387 --> 1:00:00.100
I mean, I really believe we won
the cosmic lottery, you guys, you know,

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:03.604
just to be here right now, you know?

1:00:04.521 --> 1:00:10.277
And I hope we figure it out,
whatever "it" is.

1:00:14.281 --> 1:00:17.367
You've all meant
a lot to me over the years,

1:00:18.076 --> 1:00:21.830
and I wanna thank you for that
from the bottom of my heart.

1:00:23.248 --> 1:00:26.460
So stay safe and stay sane.

1:00:30.005 --> 1:00:32.382
And I'll…

1:00:34.468 --> 1:00:35.594
see you later.
