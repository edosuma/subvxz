<b>If you lose,</b>

00:04.920 --> 00:06.480
<b>I shall take your left arm.</b>

00:06.910 --> 00:11.230
<b>Well... Instead of my left arm...</b>

00:11.990 --> 00:15.990
<b>Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?</b>

00:16.470 --> 00:17.400
<b>What?</b>

00:18.470 --> 00:19.490
<b>What do you bet?</b>

00:21.160 --> 00:22.500
<b>My life.</b>

00:23.940 --> 00:25.130
<b>Your life, was it?</b>

00:25.840 --> 00:29.000
<b>It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!</b>

00:32.770 --> 00:33.980
<b>Accept this apology.</b>

00:35.030 --> 00:38.240
<b>So this is it?</b>

00:39.260 --> 00:41.510
<b>Our golden opportunity?</b>

00:41.510 --> 00:42.360
<b>Yes...</b>

00:43.270 --> 00:45.600
<b>Our chance to infiltrate the palace.</b>

02:06.980 --> 02:11.980
<b>Knov x And x Morel</b>

02:14.650 --> 02:16.300
<b>Neferpitou has stopped</b>

02:16.300 --> 02:19.090
<b>using <i>En</i>, in order to heal the King's injury.</b>

02:19.470 --> 02:23.840
<b>Knov takes this opportunity 
to infiltrate the palace.</b>

02:27.290 --> 02:29.750
<b><i>Finally, I've gotten this close.</i></b>

02:35.290 --> 02:39.010
<b><i>Still more than one hundred meters 
to the central stairway.</i></b>

02:56.080 --> 02:58.780
<b><i>These strange trees bear very large fruit.</i></b>

02:59.620 --> 03:02.160
<b><i>Around five hundred per tree...</i></b>

03:03.400 --> 03:04.910
<b><i>And there are ten trees.</i></b>

03:05.750 --> 03:07.290
<b><i>A total of five thousand.</i></b>

03:07.900 --> 03:10.760
<b><i>Five hundred thousand people were to undergo</i></b>

03:10.760 --> 03:14.290
<b><i>the selection process each day, 
with a one-percent survival rate.</i></b>

03:15.500 --> 03:20.550
<b><i>But thanks to Killua's distractions, 
that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,</i></b>

03:21.200 --> 03:22.700
<b><i>so the numbers add up...</i></b>

03:23.770 --> 03:26.560
<b><i>These are cocoons holding the 
humans who were selected.</i></b>

03:27.410 --> 03:32.160
<b><i>Which means they will become </i>Nen<i>-wielding 
human weapons at the King's disposal,</i></b>

03:32.160 --> 03:34.060
<b><i>turning against the rest of humanity.</i></b>

03:34.540 --> 03:38.090
<b><i>Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...</i></b>

03:38.660 --> 03:42.080
<b><i>and intends to manipulate these 
soldiers per the King's will,</i></b>

03:42.080 --> 03:45.460
<b><i>expanding his conquest throughout the world.</i></b>

03:49.120 --> 03:50.830
<b><i>I will not let that happen!</i></b>

03:51.400 --> 03:55.830
<b><i>First, the far exit... is set.</i></b>

03:57.600 --> 03:58.840
<b><i>Next...</i></b>

03:58.840 --> 04:00.340
<b><i>I must get closer.</i></b>

04:01.400 --> 04:04.840
<b><i>The palace entrance looks dark...</i></b>

04:08.010 --> 04:09.220
<b><i>So far, so good...</i></b>

04:14.980 --> 04:17.840
<b><i>Middle exit... set.</i></b>

04:20.460 --> 04:22.300
<b><i>Now for the near exit.</i></b>

04:28.140 --> 04:30.370
<b><i>There aren't any guards...</i></b>

04:31.500 --> 04:34.870
<b><i>I'd imagine only a select few are inside.</i></b>

04:35.770 --> 04:36.770
<b><i>This will work.</i></b>

04:37.230 --> 04:39.540
<b><i>If I've come this far, 
I can reach the inner palace.</i></b>

04:40.940 --> 04:43.780
<b><i>The throne room is on the third 
floor, at the rear and center.</i></b>

04:43.650 --> 04:48.200
<b>King</b>

04:44.880 --> 04:48.560
<b><i>We must delay any reinforcements, 
even if by only a second.</i></b>

04:48.200 --> 04:52.160
<b>Central Stairway</b>

04:49.480 --> 04:51.700
<b><i>The first floor is too far for that.</i></b>

04:52.660 --> 04:54.270
<b><i>The central stairway, second floor.</i></b>

04:54.270 --> 04:55.640
<b><i>That's the best location!</i></b>

05:02.690 --> 05:06.160
<b><i>The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...</i></b>

05:40.580 --> 05:44.220
<b><i>To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...</i></b>

05:45.170 --> 05:48.340
<b><i>No, that would be no different 
from the one outside...</i></b>

05:49.270 --> 05:50.380
<b><i>It should at least</i></b>

05:51.020 --> 05:53.210
<b><i>be next to the first floor's central stairway.</i></b>

05:53.930 --> 05:56.570
<b><i>Then, if I can, I'll go up from 
there to the second floor...</i></b>

06:09.180 --> 06:11.100
<b>Window Opener 
Scream</b>

06:09.940 --> 06:11.100
<b><i>Scream...</i></b>

06:14.350 --> 06:15.270
<b><i>Close!</i></b>

06:43.110 --> 06:44.840
<b><i>Are any others around?</i></b>

06:46.500 --> 06:48.800
<b><i>If I'm seen, it's over.</i></b>

06:53.620 --> 06:54.720
<b><i>I'll have to retreat...</i></b>

07:06.550 --> 07:07.590
<b><i>Nothing's coming?</i></b>

07:10.040 --> 07:11.970
<b><i>Then it was alone?</i></b>

08:05.790 --> 08:06.630
<b><i>This is it.</i></b>

08:08.670 --> 08:11.510
<b><i>I can't move beyond this point...</i></b>

08:11.940 --> 08:14.090
<b><i>If I do, I'll be killed.</i></b>

08:15.470 --> 08:17.150
<b><i>What is that aura?</i></b>

08:17.930 --> 08:21.270
<b><i>It appears to be full of all 
kinds of misfortune...</i></b>

08:22.260 --> 08:24.760
<b><i>At this point, I don't fear death.</i></b>

08:25.750 --> 08:27.290
<b><i>What I fear is that,</i></b>

08:28.260 --> 08:30.280
<b><i>before killing me,</i></b>

08:30.600 --> 08:32.480
<b><i>the monsters up there</i></b>

08:32.480 --> 08:36.630
<b><i>will squeeze every drop of information 
from me that I have on the King...</i></b>

08:37.340 --> 08:41.040
<b><i>Using any brutal means necessary.</i></b>

08:41.770 --> 08:44.520
<b><i>If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...</i></b>

08:45.270 --> 08:47.040
<b><i>The aura's strength</i></b>

08:47.570 --> 08:49.130
<b><i>just confirms it...</i></b>

08:50.430 --> 08:52.210
<b><i>This is as far as I go...</i></b>

09:25.330 --> 09:29.340
<b>Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?</b>

09:29.670 --> 09:32.840
<b>My name is Leol, and don't forget it.</b>

09:33.430 --> 09:37.090
<b>I heard that I should expect 
a crayfish and wolf.</b>

09:37.520 --> 09:41.350
<b>They're dealing with the grunts you created.</b>

09:41.910 --> 09:44.100
<b>So I can fight you one-on-one.</b>

09:44.480 --> 09:47.100
<b>I appreciate that.</b>

09:48.040 --> 09:51.470
<b><i>This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.</i></b>

09:51.750 --> 09:53.960
<b><i>No, he's a little stronger.</i></b>

09:54.410 --> 09:55.610
<b>Let's get started.</b>

09:56.330 --> 10:00.370
<b><i>Right now, allowing Knov to get 
into the palace is the priority.</i></b>

10:01.390 --> 10:06.370
<b><i>Until that happens, I need to 
divert the enemy's attention.</i></b>

10:08.050 --> 10:09.380
<b>That won't help.</b>

11:12.110 --> 11:13.340
<b>This is Marcos.</b>

11:13.890 --> 11:15.000
<b>Do you have the meat?</b>

11:15.000 --> 11:17.650
<b>Yes, as requested.</b>

11:22.070 --> 11:25.000
<b><i>Refrigerated trucks are entering 
the underground warehouse...</i></b>

11:25.900 --> 11:28.160
<b><i>They're shipping in food.</i></b>

11:33.700 --> 11:35.880
<b><i>If the information Marcos 
provided was accurate,</i></b>

11:35.880 --> 11:38.450
<b><i>living women are also inside.</i></b>

11:39.050 --> 11:43.650
<b><i>Not for the King, but for the 
lecherous Secretary Bizeff.</i></b>

11:44.380 --> 11:46.300
<b><i>If everything is going as planned,</i></b>

11:46.880 --> 11:48.370
<b><i>Palm should be inside.</i></b>

12:01.790 --> 12:03.890
<b>Leave the fourth truck as it is.</b>

12:04.190 --> 12:05.200
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

12:06.530 --> 12:08.950
<b>Then we'll be leaving.</b>

13:05.710 --> 13:08.510
<b><i>Area D, of the underground warehouse.</i></b>

13:10.150 --> 13:13.710
<b><i>My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.</i></b>

13:38.490 --> 13:40.440
<b>Now, please step out.</b>

13:40.440 --> 13:42.050
<b>There's nothing to worry about.</b>

13:58.820 --> 14:01.810
<b>From now on, you will work here.</b>

14:02.550 --> 14:04.220
<b>I've prepared rooms for each of you.</b>

14:04.580 --> 14:07.270
<b>You will be provided with all necessities.</b>

14:08.170 --> 14:10.110
<b>In your spare time, you may do as you want.</b>

14:10.610 --> 14:14.330
<b>As long as you don't attempt to escape.</b>

14:18.210 --> 14:20.690
<b>Your only job</b>

14:21.480 --> 14:24.340
<b>is to follow my orders.</b>

14:25.270 --> 14:28.110
<b>When summoned, you must drop everything,</b>

14:28.110 --> 14:30.970
<b>and come to see me at once.</b>

14:31.320 --> 14:33.410
<b>Yes, Mr. Secretary.</b>

14:33.740 --> 14:34.730
<b>Excellent.</b>

14:52.410 --> 14:53.400
<b>You...</b>

14:54.460 --> 14:55.870
<b>Come with me.</b>

14:56.150 --> 14:56.900
<b>Yes.</b>

15:04.090 --> 15:07.050
<b>The rest of you can wait in your rooms.</b>

15:07.470 --> 15:08.550
<b>Yes...</b>

15:10.060 --> 15:12.750
<b>The Secretary was...</b>

15:12.750 --> 15:14.640
<b>...interested in us!</b>

15:23.860 --> 15:26.150
<b><i>I must find a way out of here,</i></b>

15:27.270 --> 15:29.760
<b><i>so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.</i></b>

15:30.850 --> 15:35.280
<b>Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe</b>

15:35.620 --> 15:38.860
<b>the current whereabouts of 
anyone she has seen previously.</b>

15:39.580 --> 15:44.250
<b>This power will allow her to keep tabs 
on the King and Royal Guard.</b>

15:44.250 --> 15:47.090
<b>The Hunters will then be able to determine</b>

15:47.540 --> 15:50.210
<b>the optimal route for the operation.</b>

15:51.880 --> 15:53.390
<b><i>Only one exit.</i></b>

15:53.800 --> 15:55.850
<b><i>I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.</i></b>

15:56.610 --> 15:59.850
<b><i>My mission is crucial for 
increasing our chances</i></b>

15:59.850 --> 16:01.810
<b><i>of defeating the King!</i></b>

16:02.530 --> 16:06.680
<b><i>What matters most isn't that I succeed...</i></b>

16:07.470 --> 16:12.320
<b><i>But that, should I fail and be captured, 
I kill myself immediately.</i></b>

16:33.810 --> 16:36.570
<b><i>I should be safe here...</i></b>

16:48.340 --> 16:49.480
<b><i>Palm...</i></b>

16:50.080 --> 16:52.030
<b><i>Don't do anything foolish!</i></b>

16:53.060 --> 16:56.290
<b><i>I managed to place the exits,</i></b>

16:56.290 --> 16:59.950
<b><i>so even if your mission doesn't succeed, 
we can still execute the operation.</i></b>

17:01.510 --> 17:03.380
<b><i>If you get caught, it's over...</i></b>

17:03.880 --> 17:04.540
<b><i>That...</i></b>

17:05.800 --> 17:06.650
<b><i>That...</i></b>

17:07.270 --> 17:08.890
<b><i>That vicious aura...</i></b>

17:10.220 --> 17:11.160
<b><i>One look</i></b>

17:12.820 --> 17:13.980
<b><i>was all it took</i></b>

17:14.520 --> 17:16.550
<b><i>to break my will...</i></b>

17:21.550 --> 17:23.900
<b><i>Gon... Killua...</i></b>

17:25.050 --> 17:29.150
<b><i>You must have seen that aura...</i></b>

17:30.200 --> 17:35.610
<b><i>You were probably even closer, 
actually touching it...</i></b>

17:38.740 --> 17:39.780
<b><i>Yet...</i></b>

17:42.690 --> 17:45.360
<b><i>How are you still able</i></b>

17:46.170 --> 17:47.580
<b><i>to face them?</i></b>

17:49.350 --> 17:51.660
<b><i>How can you bring yourself to fight?</i></b>

17:52.600 --> 17:54.530
<b><i>Is it to save your friends?</i></b>

17:55.540 --> 17:57.590
<b><i>To protect humanity?</i></b>

17:59.230 --> 18:00.440
<b><i>Why...</i></b>

18:01.260 --> 18:03.030
<b><i>Why are you still fighting?</i></b>

18:05.420 --> 18:06.630
<b><i>Palm!</i></b>

18:09.020 --> 18:10.230
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

18:11.010 --> 18:12.130
<b><i>Don't do anything foolish.</i></b>

18:12.740 --> 18:14.230
<b><i>I beg you...</i></b>

18:15.420 --> 18:17.850
<b><i>If you're caught, it's all over...</i></b>

18:20.010 --> 18:21.120
<b><i>Palm!</i></b>

18:22.450 --> 18:23.950
<b><i>I won't be able...</i></b>

18:25.080 --> 18:27.250
<b><i>to go back there...</i></b>

18:37.840 --> 18:40.910
<b>I brought you something cold to drink.</b>

18:52.630 --> 18:53.840
<b>You're dismissed.</b>

18:54.180 --> 18:56.370
<b>Wait in your room.</b>

18:56.370 --> 18:57.150
<b>Yes.</b>

19:12.760 --> 19:15.590
<b>Your lack of familiarity with the 
area has sealed your defeat.</b>

19:15.590 --> 19:19.540
<b>Though it's almost too perfect that, 
after all that running,</b>

19:19.540 --> 19:21.980
<b>you ended up in an underground church.</b>

19:23.550 --> 19:27.770
<b>In case of emergency, this place 
is used as an air shelter.</b>

19:28.330 --> 19:31.440
<b>An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.</b>

19:32.400 --> 19:36.220
<b>Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.</b>

19:36.220 --> 19:38.490
<b>I'm an atheist.</b>

19:40.160 --> 19:42.320
<b>You're a cocky guy.</b>

19:43.100 --> 19:46.540
<b><i>Let's see who's trapped whom.</i></b>

20:01.350 --> 20:03.500
<b>Cheetu told me everything.</b>

20:03.500 --> 20:06.720
<b>I hear you can mold that 
smoke into various objects.</b>

20:06.720 --> 20:09.790
<b><i>Knowing that, he still chased me in here?</i></b>

20:11.240 --> 20:12.730
<b><i>Even better.</i></b>

20:13.280 --> 20:16.200
<b><i>If he believes things are going his way,</i></b>

20:16.600 --> 20:20.240
<b><i>he won't hesitate to display his abilities.</i></b>

20:20.980 --> 20:21.900
<b><i>However,</i></b>

20:21.900 --> 20:24.470
<b><i>I've yet to meet anyone whose power</i></b>

20:24.470 --> 20:28.740
<b><i>allows them to react more 
flexibly than Deep Purple.</i></b>

20:31.280 --> 20:34.510
<b><i>I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.</i></b>

20:34.920 --> 20:38.250
<b><i>Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...</i></b>

20:38.790 --> 20:40.590
<b><i>I really dig it.</i></b>

20:41.610 --> 20:45.140
<b><i>It's common sense to defeat an opponent 
before they can use their power.</i></b>

20:45.530 --> 20:48.210
<b><i>But that isn't how men</i></b>

20:48.770 --> 20:50.930
<b><i>should fight.</i></b>

20:58.410 --> 21:01.240
<b>Hey, what are you up to?</b>

21:01.240 --> 21:03.900
<b>Voluntarily removing one of your senses?</b>

21:04.570 --> 21:07.410
<b>Have you heard of the band Black Planet?</b>

21:07.870 --> 21:11.410
<b>Their second album is super cool.</b>

21:11.920 --> 21:14.920
<b>It's a twelve-song medley.</b>

21:15.370 --> 21:19.420
<b>Listening to the whole thing's 
like reading a good book.</b>

21:19.420 --> 21:22.310
<b>When you finish it, you feel great.</b>

21:23.350 --> 21:24.680
<b>I know.</b>

21:25.220 --> 21:30.010
<b><i>And best part of all, the medley's 
exactly sixty minutes long.</i></b>

21:33.660 --> 21:35.190
<b>It's a masterpiece!</b>

21:37.260 --> 21:39.820
<b>I hate to admit it, but I agree.</b>

21:45.390 --> 21:47.940
<b>Rental, start!</b>

21:48.810 --> 21:50.170
<b><i>This could be bad...</i></b>

21:53.950 --> 21:55.710
<b><i>I have a hard time fighting</i></b>

21:56.270 --> 21:58.460
<b><i>others who share my tastes.</i></b>

23:24.710 --> 23:26.910
<b>Next time: Return x And x Retire.</b>

23:26.910 --> 23:28.040
<b>Killua!</b>

23:28.040 --> 23:29.010
<b><i>Return on.</i></b>

23:28.370 --> 23:29.680
<b>Killua!</b>

23:29.010 --> 23:29.980
<b>To the next episode preview!</b>

23:29.980 --> 23:32.390
<b>It has to be you, Killua!</b>

23:32.390 --> 23:34.220
<b>Hey, stop crying.</b>
