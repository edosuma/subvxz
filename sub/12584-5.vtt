00:33.033 --> 00:36.411
The Japanese call this poetry haiku.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.537
Yes, Bobby?

00:37.620 --> 00:39.914
Oh. I was just stretching.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.583


00:41.666 --> 00:44.085
The haiku poem has five syllables,

00:44.169 --> 00:47.088
then seven, then five... Bobby?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.006
What?

00:48.089 --> 00:51.593
There's a magnet in the ceiling,
and it has my pencil.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.636
-

00:53.720 --> 00:55.638
And the magnet just released.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.435
<i>And that</i>

01:00.518 --> 01:02.062
is how Jesus taught us

01:02.145 --> 01:04.564
not to borrow things from people,

01:04.647 --> 01:08.401
then destroy them,
then pass them off as missing.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.238
Now, if all the children of the flock
will join me on the stairs.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.951
Ohh... there's something wrong
with my eyes today.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.080
Bobby.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.665
Hello, "dere."

01:22.749 --> 01:24.584


01:29.923 --> 01:31.424
I thought I smelled corn,

01:31.508 --> 01:32.717
and this confirms it.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.641
That was not me.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.767
Dang it, Bobby.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.645
This is inappropriate
dinner table behavior.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.563
-Now, right now, I want...
I know.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.898
Go to my room.

01:47.524 --> 01:51.402
Hey, d'you ever wonder where kids went to
before they had rooms?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.197
-I mean, did caveman dads say...
-Just go.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.828
Peggy, what are we gonna do about the boy?

01:59.911 --> 02:02.080
He's cutting up at church, at school.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.374
Heck, I can't even take him
to the Mega-Lo-Mart

02:04.457 --> 02:06.626
without him trying to get
on the PA system.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.545
Hank, you cannot blame Bobby.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.589
He just has no outlet
to express his creativity.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.092
He's a boy,
he doesn't need to be creative.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.219
Our son can make people laugh.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.720
Some call that a gift.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.888
I do as well.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.017
You know, in high school, we all thought
Raul Sanders was a laugh riot.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.228
Then when he got six months in juvie

02:25.311 --> 02:28.106
and had a child out of wedlock,
we stopped laughing.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.276
School is not about being the class clown.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.610
Unless...

02:32.694 --> 02:35.071
it's a class full of clowns.

02:37.615 --> 02:41.035
They teach a class in clowning
at Arlen Community College.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.287
A clowning class?

02:42.620 --> 02:45.081
Perfect. This is just what Bobby needs.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.585
A supportive place where he can work out
all his comedy energy.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.879
Huh... it's not a bad idea.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.464
It's like running your dog
around the park for an hour

02:53.548 --> 02:55.675
to keep him from jumping
all over the furniture.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.178
But Bobby can't go to college. He's 13.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.055
Sometimes you don't have
to be college years old.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.184
There was a kid
in my history class that was 12.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.518
I liked him.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.021
Whenever I would answer
a question in class,

03:08.104 --> 03:09.355
he would laugh.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.691
I went to his birthday party.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.693
Lie down in your basket, Ladybird.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.821
Yes.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.910
A class in clowning?

03:21.993 --> 03:23.536
And you're supporting it?

03:23.620 --> 03:25.205
But here's the deal, son.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.790
The shenanigans stay in clown class,

03:27.874 --> 03:30.210
not at school or church or anyplace else

03:30.293 --> 03:31.544
that's not appropriate.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.630
Now get some sleep.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.883
Or stay up all night,
whichever makes you funnier.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.890
I think a clown class
is a great idea for Bobby.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.893
You know, I had a picture of a clown
above my bed growing up.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.604
I thought it was God for the longest time.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.440
I've done extermination
for three different Bozos.

03:52.523 --> 03:56.444
Nice guys, but do not get them started
on gay marriage.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.198
Hey.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.951
Hey, we got your ball.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.287
Hey. Ball.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.293
Gentlemen, this kickball
rolled into our lives for a reason.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.554
Well, you've still got a wicked curveball,
Boomhauer.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.640
I'm gonna have to call myself out.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.101
Bill, get ready. I'm bunting.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.269
I'm gonna get you.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.649
Ah, it's as good as I remember.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.989
So I see you're all ready
for your, uh, clown class.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.492
Can you lean back a little?
Your hair is in my blind spot.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.910
Do you think it works?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.454
I thought about wearing a hat
on top of the hair,

04:48.538 --> 04:51.541
but I couldn't decide
if that was funny or just crazy.

04:54.752 --> 04:58.047
Now, Bobby, go in there
and give everything you've got.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.883
And if you still feel funny
at the end of class,

05:00.967 --> 05:02.510
stay after for extra credit.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.970
Got it, Dad.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.903
Hi. Bobby Hill, Tom Landry class clown.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.364
Oh, hi. I am so excited.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.991
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.492
Don't you just love comedy?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.672
Great clowns are not born.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.216
They are made right here.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.844
I make clowns.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.099
If you're looking for an easy A,
think again.

05:50.433 --> 05:55.104
In fact, some refer to this class
as "Frowns for Clowns."

05:56.064 --> 05:59.233
Ah... I see some of you
are already wearing your fright wigs.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.614
The wig isn't something you wear,
it is something you earn.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.912
Do you know why the shoes wear big
or the nose be bulbous?

06:10.995 --> 06:12.455
Uh... funny?

06:12.538 --> 06:15.208
Of course, they're funny.
They're hilarious, in fact.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.879
But if you don't know why,
it is pointless.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.424
Can anyone explain this equation to me?

06:23.508 --> 06:24.967
Can you explain this?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.303
No.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.973
Until you can, dispose of your costuming.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.102
You are nowhere near funny.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.030
All right, our first lesson,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.533
textbook chapter one, funny words.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.326
You. Name a body part.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.203
-Uh... leg.
-Not funny.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.579
And here's why:

06:53.663 --> 06:55.706
no funny letters.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
Sacroiliac.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.252
Exactly.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.505
It has the K sound twice,
and the oi sound.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.798
Excellent work, Boris.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.967
Boris is taking this class
for the ninth time,

07:06.050 --> 07:07.927
and he is almost a clown.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.847
-Someday, and with your help, sir.
-Armpit?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.265
Um... no.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.933
But your attempt is pathetic,

07:14.016 --> 07:16.185
and pathos is one
of the cornerstones of comedy.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.649
John Redcorn.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.318
Joseph.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.988
Uh...

07:31.117 --> 07:32.076
Connie.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.329
Dale, I suppose.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.373
Gih. I'm picked last?

07:37.623 --> 07:41.002
But does your precious Connie
own custom kickball shoes?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.675
Hey, Bobby. How was your first day?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.260
Do you want to show us your juggling?

07:49.343 --> 07:51.929
I haven't learned how to actually juggle,

07:52.013 --> 07:56.058
but I can tell you
why juggling the fragile

07:56.142 --> 07:59.729
is almost as funny
as juggling the intractable.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.105
Oh.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.442
Professor Twilley knows
all about this kind of stuff.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.111
He's gonna help me
reach my comedic potential.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.237
Uh-huh.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.074
According to him,
Adam Sandler isn't funny.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.618
All right, son.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.704
Well, I guess I better go hit the books.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.542
He didn't make a single dumb joke.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.169
He was just... regular.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.631
Oh, God, he's doing a pratfall.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.382
No, wait, that was real.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.135
That actually looks like
a pretty nasty scrape.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.136
Attaboy.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.015
A unicycle with six wheels?

08:36.098 --> 08:38.768
Oh, the number six.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.188
Are you laughing at or with?

08:42.271 --> 08:44.440
-Uh... at?
-Wrong.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.902
Oh, Mr. Twilley,
that's why I came here today.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.779
I'm kind of not getting it.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.322
No kidding.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.783
But I've always been the funny kid.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.743
I do stuff, people laugh.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.662
I thought I was a natural.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.997
Have I been wrong all these years?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.165
Oh, definitely.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.254
But it's not your fault.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.839
You haven't been properly trained.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.259
Look at your flow chart of funny.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.804
Comedy starts with the "Ha,"

09:14.887 --> 09:17.181
which identifies the situation as comedic.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.392
The "Ha" is followed by the "Guffaw."

09:19.475 --> 09:21.310
This creates anticipation.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.439
Next, there is the "Aw,"
to condition your audience for surprise

09:25.523 --> 09:28.442
at the final element, the "Ha-Ha."

09:28.943 --> 09:30.194
Now does it make sense?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.656
Not really.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.826
But you got to believe me,
I really want to understand.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.412
I want to be the best clown I can be.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.707
I'm not going to give up on you yet.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.293
I think what you need
is some supplemental reading

09:45.376 --> 09:48.004
from my personal archives, including this.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.339
It's a copy of Steve Allen's
<i>How to Be Funny</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:52.550
that he signed for ten extra dollars.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.969
I'll start studying these right away.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.598
Uh, wait. This one's not in English.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.016
You're welcome.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.856
A kick and a miss

10:06.939 --> 10:09.859
for John "No-Scorin' Red-corin."

10:09.942 --> 10:11.527
I thought we said no bouncies.

10:16.741 --> 10:17.867
Ow!

10:19.327 --> 10:22.622
Could you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to study.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.749
You bet, son.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.083
You're out.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.254
This was my first audition
for Cirque Fantastique.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.590
It seems like just yesterday

10:32.673 --> 10:35.426
I answered to the name Dodo McGoofGoof.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.262
Ooh, here's where I do
"the pantomime of the wrong greeting"

10:38.346 --> 10:40.222
entirely in gibberish.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.726
<i>Gwata galumpus. Ig skalko menifista.</i>

10:46.562 --> 10:49.315
All right, we have established
this is funny.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.441
But why?

10:50.941 --> 10:56.364
Uh, it's funny because it follows
Aristotle's dictum. It delights.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.450
Note the gallivanting, and teaches.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.370
The bear chases you since you poked him.

11:02.453 --> 11:07.208
And it follows
the "ha, guffaw, aw, ha-ha" formula.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.959
Congratulations, Bobby.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.295
You have just proven why I am funny.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.798
-I think you're ready for character work.
-Really?

11:13.881 --> 11:16.842
Yes, we'll begin your study
of Commedia Dell'Arte.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.344
Classic clowning.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.681
Hmph. I had to take this class six times
before I got to do that.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.061
Hey, Bobby.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.896
So what's college like?

11:28.979 --> 11:31.357
Is it true the library is open all night?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.608
It's brutal.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.780
Today I have to come up
with a Commedia Dell'Arte-style character.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.115
Wow.

11:43.411 --> 11:47.623
Mild deception is
the lowest form of tomfoolery.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.709
But people will think he farted.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.211
Joseph, after taking this class,

11:52.294 --> 11:55.548
I realize that that isn't funny,

11:55.631 --> 11:59.343
and I also realize that you are not funny.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.845
Aw, man.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.140
But, Connie, you are hilarious.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.641
-Really?
-Yes.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.351
In Algebra this morning,

12:07.435 --> 12:10.479
you said Clark Peters is as dumb as a dog.

12:10.563 --> 12:16.193
But what you were really saying
is that a dog is as smart as a boy.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.319
Wonderful.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.655
Uh... yeah.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.157
Hmm.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.496
I am a dog as smart as a boy.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.999
A precocious trickster am I.

12:30.082 --> 12:35.254
They call me Tartuffe the Spry Wonder Dog.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.727
Magnificently absurd.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.604
The comedic requirements are all there.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.898
Intention communication, inopportunity,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.608
non-naturalism, prancing.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.401
It has the energy of Jacques Callot

12:57.485 --> 12:59.987
and the élan of Waylon Flowers and Madam.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.323
Yes.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.829
Don't blot my bacon, Mom.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.039
I'm celebrating.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.040
You got it.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.960
I sit at the table,

13:15.044 --> 13:18.339
yet my proper position is by your feet.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.758
What manner of scamp am I?

13:21.634 --> 13:24.470
I really don't understand
what is happening.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.972
Now, cut that out...

13:27.056 --> 13:28.557
whatever that is you're doing.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.976
Sorry, Dad. I'm just excited.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.687
See, I was starting to think
I wasn't funny.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.608
But then my teacher helped me come up
with this great new character.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.236
Uh-huh, that's fine,
just keep it in class.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.073
Up to now, you've done a pretty good job
of not being funny around here.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.157
So just keep it up.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.492
Okay, Dad.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.660
Pass the ketchup.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.994
Regular ketchup,

13:49.078 --> 13:52.414
or one that weighs 10,000 pounds?

13:54.375 --> 13:55.376
Regular.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.717
<i>Excusez-moi?</i>

14:04.176 --> 14:06.136
If you're here to nominate me

14:06.220 --> 14:08.597
for an American Clowning Award,
the petition is right here.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.225
Oh, hello, Bobby.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.478
Professor, my school talent show
is coming up.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.941
Do you think I should perform a sketch
as Tartuffe the Spry Wonder Dog?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.443
Bobby, that's an idea and three-quarters.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.863
It's moments like this
that are so much more rewarding

14:23.946 --> 14:25.990
than winning an American Clowning Award.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.622
Now, who will be attending
this talent show?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.250
Everyone in the school will be there,

14:36.333 --> 14:37.877
since we get out of class for it.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.962
Even the janitors get to come.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.423
I have always wanted to bring
classic clowning

14:42.506 --> 14:44.008
to the children of Arlen.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.010
The janitorial staff will be a bonus.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.763
Now, we must find the perfect costume
for Tartuffe.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.643
Eh. Doesn't wow me.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.063
Good eye, Bobby.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.649
You, of course, need something bolder.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.235
What about this?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.321
And these?

15:07.531 --> 15:08.365
Perfect.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.201
The middle school will be agog.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.788
I'm gonna be the most popular kid
in school.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.001
I don't know what they do.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.628
Ask him.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.005
You're in clown school.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.715
Do something funny now.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.759
Off the top of my head,

15:26.842 --> 15:30.679
there are 17 things I could do
with this globe that are funny,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.264
and two that aren't.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.974
Wow.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.894
But... you'll have to wait
until the talent show,

15:36.977 --> 15:38.854
like everyone else.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.150
Everyone play deep,
this guy swings a big leg.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.415
The ball was wet.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.668
It, it wasn't my fault.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.253
There was nothing anyone could've done.

16:04.296 --> 16:08.634
Well, balls come and balls go,
when you think about it.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.887
Well, I guess that's it.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.390
I've got to get to work anyway.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.524
I am so excited. Is my plume straight?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.026
Your plume is delightfully askew.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.113
Now, will your father
be attending the performance today?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.909
No. Dad doesn't think I'm funny.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.955
Historically, clown fathers
haven't been very supportive.

16:38.372 --> 16:43.252
It is up to I and you to break
the cycle of indifference.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.755
Strickland Propane. Hank speaking.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.509
Mr. Hill, this is Professor Twilley,
Bobby's clownology teacher.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.929
Professor? You can actually
become a professor in that?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.557
Yes. Any more questions?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.017
Uh, no.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.854
Good, because you are about to miss
your boy's shining moment.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.899
Bobby, or shall I say Monsieur Tartuffe
the Spry Wonder Dog,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.861
is about to entertain
the entire student body.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.821
<i>Bobby, practice your flouncing.</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:13.157
<i>Flouncier... Flouncier!</i>

17:13.240 --> 17:15.492
<i>Pip pip. Pip pip.</i>

17:25.085 --> 17:27.087
You've stepped in lava.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.300
Now you're moving through pudding.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.636
Bobby, you're up next.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.929
Wonderful.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.515
A seat in the front row, please.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.353
Excuse me, sir.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.897
-Do you have a ticket?
-No.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.775
I just have to give something
to my son, Bobby Hill.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.277
-It's urgent.
-Sir, if you don't have a ticket,

17:50.360 --> 17:51.320
I can't allow you to...

17:51.904 --> 17:53.572
Did he just run in my hallway?

17:53.655 --> 17:55.449
You stay here. I'll be right back.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.371
What am I doing?

18:02.498 --> 18:03.540
Go. Fight. Landry.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.084
Go. Fight.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.460
Go. Go.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.837
Fight. Fight.

18:09.129 --> 18:09.963
Bobby?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.509
Dad.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.676
You made it.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.429
I went by the house
and brought you some of your gag toys.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.182
I got your rubber chicken,
your... fake hand.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.435
Take 'em out there with you.
You've got to do your old stuff.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.063
So you think I'm funny?

18:26.146 --> 18:27.981
No, Bobby, I don't,

18:28.065 --> 18:30.442
but according to the notes
your teachers send home,

18:30.526 --> 18:31.777
your classmates do.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.239
Look, this guy's got you thinking
this jester crap is funny.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.491
It's not funny, it's just weird.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.118
And they'll think it's weird.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.495
And you still have four years
of high school

18:41.578 --> 18:42.496
with these kids.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.206
They'll find another class clown,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.834
and you'll just be that creepy kid
in the bodysuit

18:46.917 --> 18:48.502
who ruined the talent show.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.046
No thanks, Dad.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.756
I'm a real clown now.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.592
I don't need to rely on cheap props.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.889
Next up, the comedy stylings
of Bobby Hill.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.522
Huh?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.984
And now, Tartuffe the Spry Wonder Dog

19:12.067 --> 19:16.155
upsets a ladies' tea ceremony
and is severely beaten.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.489
Oh, God.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.908
Of course I'd like some tea,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.953
as long as it's not going to scald me.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.121
Ow.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.206
It scalds.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.587
Perfect. Don't be afraid of the silence.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.589
Uh...

19:33.672 --> 19:36.508
Certainly, Madam, I would like a beating.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.969
Wait. Did I say "like"?

19:39.052 --> 19:41.930
I meant to say "not like."

19:45.934 --> 19:48.729
It's not funny.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.440
You're getting a reaction, Bobby.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.400
They're booing you, son.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.402
You are almost at the Ha-Ha.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.571
The Ha-Ha, Bobby. The Ha-Ha.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.033
They look pretty creeped out,
I can see it from here.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.960
Oh, my God. What is that?

20:17.382 --> 20:21.511
Excuse me, ladies,
I had a few too many beans today.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.971
Oh.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.351
There goes my bean sandwich.

20:30.812 --> 20:34.233
What? What could possibly
be funny about fart noises?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.944
Bobby. You don't want
these kinds of laughs.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.279
This laughter is ill-informed.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.873
This was Principal Moss five minutes ago.

21:06.181 --> 21:09.142
Oh. The old "pencil in the can" bit.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
Always funny.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.812
Don't know why.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.185
-<i>I thought I smelled corn,
and this confirms it.</i>
