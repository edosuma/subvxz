TARA (OFFSCREEN): Previously,
on "Dance Academy"--

00:03.839 --> 00:05.639
-What happens to me
on the holidays?

00:05.679 --> 00:07.160
-In line with your
bail conditions,

00:07.200 --> 00:08.599
you'll be staying here.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.720
-Seriously, when was the last
time you ate something?

00:11.759 --> 00:14.199
Abigail.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.679
-Abigail.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.440
-Would it honestly be the end
of the world if you deferred

00:17.480 --> 00:19.199
until next year?

00:19.239 --> 00:23.399
Just until we can
work things out?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.600
-It's clean.

00:27.239 --> 00:27.679
-Look.

00:27.719 --> 00:28.519
You got it.

00:28.559 --> 00:29.839
-The first year scholarship.

00:29.879 --> 00:31.320
-Every week, you'll be doing
private classes with me,

00:31.359 --> 00:33.479
working harder than you
ever thought possible.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.840
-You're telling me I can stay?

00:34.880 --> 00:36.240
-Yes!

00:40.759 --> 00:42.479
[theme music]

00:54.159 --> 00:57.119
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:57.159 --> 01:01.159
Close your eyes.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.519
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.480
This is my chance.

01:11.519 --> 01:14.480
This is my chance-- my
chance to feel alive.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.760
TARA (OFFSCREEN): There was
this girl I knew from

01:30.799 --> 01:32.040
[inaudible]

01:32.079 --> 01:36.159
sort of wide eyed, awkward,
never been kissed--

01:36.200 --> 01:40.319
with an extreme talent for
embarrassing herself.

01:40.359 --> 01:44.400
I, on the other hand, have a
boyfriend who is, like--

01:44.439 --> 01:45.560
-Hey, you.

01:45.599 --> 01:48.519
TARA (OFFSCREEN): --golden,
amazing friends.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.280
And starting this week,
I can dance en pointe.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.159
This semester really is going
to be spectacular.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.199
-Hey.

02:18.240 --> 02:18.800
-You're back early.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.840
-Yeah.

02:19.879 --> 02:21.400
I have to start privates
with Ms. Raine.

02:21.439 --> 02:25.439
It's one of the requirements
of my scholarship.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.840
How are you?

02:26.879 --> 02:27.639
-(SARCASTIC) Super.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.840
Thanks for asking.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.159
-Hey.

02:34.199 --> 02:35.599
-Good holiday?

02:35.639 --> 02:38.039
-Did you know Laura in the
cafeteria hasn't spoken to

02:38.080 --> 02:39.840
Edgar the cleaner since the
passionfruit-sponge cake

02:39.879 --> 02:42.560
incident of 2002?

02:42.599 --> 02:43.759
-So climbing the walls, then?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.479
-Little bit.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.199
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): It was
the finals of the National

02:48.240 --> 02:49.639
Junior Ballet Eisteddfod.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.560
I danced perfectly.

02:51.599 --> 02:53.639
The adjudicator read
out the results--

02:53.680 --> 02:55.800
fourth, third, second--

02:55.840 --> 02:57.319
and then my mum just
started squealing

02:57.360 --> 03:00.280
because we knew I'd won.

03:00.319 --> 03:03.280
After that, Dad took us
all out for dinner--

03:03.319 --> 03:06.479
mum, my sister, me, Kat.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.800
-Kat?

03:07.840 --> 03:10.639
-Ex-best friend, now frenemy--

03:10.680 --> 03:12.199
irrelevant.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.479
We all ordered desserts--

03:13.520 --> 03:16.759
only desserts, two each.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.560
-And what about that
made you happy?

03:19.599 --> 03:21.360
Winning?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.639
Dancing perfectly?

03:23.680 --> 03:24.840
Eating whatever you wanted?

03:27.439 --> 03:31.599
-Feeling supported and sharing
with my friends and family.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.439
Adam?

03:39.479 --> 03:42.080
The strength and self belief
you've taught me makes me

03:42.120 --> 03:44.159
certain I'm ready to start
dancing on Monday.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.400
-Read me anything
you've written.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.479
I know wherever I am,
I will do my best.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.719
And that is all I will
ever ask of myself.

04:03.759 --> 04:06.319
-And is that something
you truly believe?

04:06.360 --> 04:08.120
Or is it an affirmation
you copied down

04:08.159 --> 04:11.080
from an internet site?

04:11.120 --> 04:14.120
You're being a perfect patient,
writing the perfect

04:14.159 --> 04:18.079
diary, eating the
perfect diet.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.800
But your need to control every
situation isn't helping you.

04:26.519 --> 04:30.319
You're making progress, Abigail,
and that's great.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.720
But you're not yet strong enough
to return to ballet.

04:32.759 --> 04:35.079
-I'm ready to dance.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.519
I need to dance.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.199
-Then go dancing.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.079
Dance with a friend.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.680
Dance for the love of it.

04:41.720 --> 04:45.319
No ballet, no classes, no
practicing in that studio--

04:45.360 --> 04:47.800
nothing that could trigger
unhealthy thoughts.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.279
-Yes.

04:54.319 --> 04:54.800
OK.

04:54.839 --> 04:55.959
I'll ask her.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.759
Hey, I'm teaching cha
cha again tomorrow--

04:57.800 --> 04:58.519
grandma and friends.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.720
Can you come?

04:59.759 --> 05:02.120
She wants a female
perspective.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
Can't be there.

05:03.199 --> 05:05.120
Love you.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.639
So, how was it?

05:08.680 --> 05:09.480
-Breakthrough.

05:09.519 --> 05:10.600
He hypnotized me.

05:10.639 --> 05:11.680
Made me cluck like a chicken.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.120
-Are you allowed to
go back to class?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.199
-Are you allowed to stalk me?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.360
-Stalk?

05:17.399 --> 05:18.720
-You've been here every
day of the holidays.

05:18.759 --> 05:21.319
Don't you have anything
better to do?

05:21.360 --> 05:24.680
-Not so much, no.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
-Hi, honey.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.639
I'm home.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.160
-Kat!

05:28.199 --> 05:30.399
-Whoa, slow down.

05:30.439 --> 05:31.160
-When did you get back?

05:31.199 --> 05:32.439
How was Europe?

05:32.480 --> 05:33.319
Did Natasha really ground
you in the hotel room?

05:33.360 --> 05:34.160
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Uh, yes.

05:34.199 --> 05:36.160
-Hey, how goes it, champ?

05:36.199 --> 05:37.040
-Unreal.

05:37.079 --> 05:38.639
-Roommate, meet boyfriend.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.160
Boyfriend, ditto, except
other way around.

05:41.199 --> 05:41.839
-Oh, what?

05:41.879 --> 05:42.879
We're official already?

05:42.920 --> 05:45.480
I thought we were just
holding hands.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.240
Uh, so, roomie didn't make the
second semester cut, and

05:48.279 --> 05:49.759
you're moving in with me.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.399
-There will be deeper cuts at
the end of this term, Katrina.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.279
I hope you all managed a few
classes during your break.

05:55.319 --> 05:56.480
Tara has a private lesson.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.480
Tara's balance will change
in pas de deux

06:04.519 --> 06:05.920
now she's on pointe.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.480
I suggest you spend the rest of
your holidays practicing.

06:07.519 --> 06:08.680
Are you ready?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.519
Releves in fifth position.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.399
You know, when you arrived, we
talked about choosing your

06:28.439 --> 06:29.600
friends wisely.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.639
Pose up.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.839
You didn't.

06:34.839 --> 06:36.720
Better.

06:36.759 --> 06:39.600
You need to make a decision
about what's more important--

06:39.639 --> 06:43.319
your training or other
distractions.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.839
-He's a diplobrat I picked up
in Paris who's mum's an

06:49.879 --> 06:51.800
attache case or something.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.319
Anyway, Natasha loathes him.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.319
She went crazy when he
kept turning up.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.680
What, don't you like him?

06:58.720 --> 06:59.800
-No, it's not that.

06:59.839 --> 07:01.279
Ms. Raine just gave me
the third degree.

07:01.319 --> 07:03.639
According to her, I can't hang
out with you and be serious

07:03.680 --> 07:05.600
about dancing.

07:05.639 --> 07:07.720
-She can't tell you who you
can be friends with.

07:07.759 --> 07:08.360
What is this?

07:08.399 --> 07:09.120
Primary school?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.399
-Straight down into his--

07:11.439 --> 07:14.600
-Samuel, how can you bear to
leave these arms so tragically

07:14.639 --> 07:15.199
empty?

07:15.240 --> 07:16.720
-How was Europe?

07:16.759 --> 07:20.160
-I can say, "you're grounded,
young lady" in four languages.

07:20.199 --> 07:21.800
-More junk.

07:21.839 --> 07:24.480
This semester's there's
going to be rules.

07:24.519 --> 07:25.800
-No, roomie's not coming back.

07:25.839 --> 07:27.199
So I'm moving in with Kat.

07:30.839 --> 07:34.560
-How sweet, Bambi and Thumper
together at last.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.519
-OK, thanks.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.720
Bye.

07:42.439 --> 07:43.800
-Why are you still in my room?

08:08.639 --> 08:09.839
-I'm sure the audiences
love you.

08:09.879 --> 08:12.040
I can hear them chanting,
Ethan.

08:12.079 --> 08:13.399
-Let them chant.

08:13.439 --> 08:14.600
Can't wait to see you.

08:14.639 --> 08:17.279
-Can't wait to see you either.

08:17.319 --> 08:19.160
-What shall I wear
to [inaudible]?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.120
-Um, busy.

08:20.160 --> 08:20.480
-Mmhm.

08:20.519 --> 08:20.800
I know.

08:20.839 --> 08:21.480
Hi.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.480
-Kitty Kat, long time.

08:23.519 --> 08:26.240
Heard Natasha sent you
home in disgrace.

08:26.279 --> 08:26.720
-Yeah.

08:26.759 --> 08:27.439
Bye, Ethan.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.399
She'll call you back.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.480
Trashy in a good way?

09:18.639 --> 09:19.759
-Um, you need to get
me on my leg.

09:19.799 --> 09:21.639
-I think you have
pull up more.

09:21.679 --> 09:22.200
(JOKING) Help!

09:22.240 --> 09:23.399
Help!

10:10.200 --> 10:12.799
-I hope you ate some of that.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.240
-I eat what the diet
plan specifies.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.039
-So, for one night only
I'm teaching my

10:21.080 --> 10:22.600
cha-cha class here.

10:22.639 --> 10:26.399
Studio one is now booked, and
it's only two step away, so

10:26.440 --> 10:28.840
there's no excuse not come.

10:28.879 --> 10:32.360
-Except that it's a parade
of saggy geriatric bodies

10:32.399 --> 10:35.440
shuffling around a studio.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.440
Achieving what?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.399
Grace?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.320
Beauty?

10:38.360 --> 10:39.600
Technical protection?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.639
-They don't have to
achieve anything.

10:40.679 --> 10:43.399
-That's a relief.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.399
-Look, just--

10:44.440 --> 10:47.320
just come by and watch.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.200
-Therapy's enough pointless
exercise for one day.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.799
-Cease to crunch, little one.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.600
We are going out.

10:54.639 --> 10:56.759
-Only three set to go.

10:56.799 --> 10:59.440
The Kiefers are playing
a warm up gig.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.519
-The Kiefers?

11:00.559 --> 11:02.480
-At a private club-- all ages.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.480
And our names are on the door.

11:04.519 --> 11:06.519
-But it's the first day of term
tomorrow, and we have Ms.

11:06.559 --> 11:08.320
Raine classical at 9:00 AM.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.480
-It starts at 6:00, and we'll
be back before curfew.

11:10.519 --> 11:12.159
-But we'll be wrecked.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.679
-Tara, how many times have
I said no to you?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.480
-You're going with
diplobrat anyway.

11:16.519 --> 11:17.799
Why do you even need me?

11:17.840 --> 11:19.720
-Because you don't like him.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.360
-I barely even know him.

11:21.399 --> 11:23.159
-Well, can you at least
make an effort then?

11:26.200 --> 11:29.840
Tara, when we are old, we will
look back on this as the

11:29.879 --> 11:33.799
defining moment of
our friendship.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.399
-Defining moment?

11:34.440 --> 11:35.600
-Uh-huh.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.120
-You gonna let me
dance or not?

11:51.159 --> 11:53.399
-We all want to feel you're
strong enough to cope with the

11:53.440 --> 11:55.799
extra pressure ballet
puts on you.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.720
-Is that a yes or a no?

11:58.759 --> 12:00.080
-You're not ready yet.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.320
I can see you have a
reaction to that.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.519
How do you feel when I say you
can't go back to ballet?

12:08.559 --> 12:11.480
-Fine.

12:11.519 --> 12:12.679
-Be more specific.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.720
-I feel like I eat and I
eat and I do exactly

12:23.759 --> 12:25.360
what I'm told to do.

12:25.399 --> 12:27.759
And I write my stupid
little diary.

12:27.799 --> 12:30.559
And I imagine my stupid
coping strategies.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.120
And you still won't
let me dance.

12:33.159 --> 12:33.799
-That's good.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.159
I want you to be honest.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.600
-Honest?

12:36.639 --> 12:37.840
I'll give you honest.

12:37.879 --> 12:39.480
It is unfair.

12:39.519 --> 12:40.960
I'll fall behind.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.600
There are performances at the
end of the year and someone

12:42.639 --> 12:44.200
else will get my role.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.639
-Everybody wants you
to dance again.

12:45.679 --> 12:46.679
We just want to be health--

12:46.720 --> 12:49.559
-Why are you doing this to me?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
You're just like ballet.

12:50.639 --> 12:51.519
-How am I like ballet?

12:51.559 --> 12:53.480
-I give it everything.

12:53.519 --> 12:56.600
I never get anything back.

12:56.639 --> 12:57.399
I love ballet.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.799
Ballet just doesn't love me.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.159
-Ballet doesn't have
feelings, Abigail.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.080
It can't love you
or not love you.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.720
-Are we done?

13:03.759 --> 13:06.440
-All your teachers say you're
a wonderful dancer.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.360
If you choose, you can have
a professional career.

13:09.399 --> 13:11.399
Or you can follow an unhealthy
path that'll make it

13:11.440 --> 13:12.480
impossible for you to dance.

13:12.519 --> 13:13.960
Now, today, you've
got choices.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.639
If you don't deal with this,
you're gonna lose that power.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.519
-About time.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.639
Relax, T. I'll get you home
before your pumpkin.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.600
-Hey, man.

13:31.639 --> 13:32.519
-Hi.

13:32.559 --> 13:33.720
-Uh, Lucas Hewitt.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.120
-Uh, she's with us.

13:43.159 --> 13:44.120
-It's Lucas plus one.

13:44.159 --> 13:46.039
-Casting told me to
bring a hottie.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.159
-You and one other.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.120
-We'll wait out here.

13:49.159 --> 13:49.679
You go inside and find--

13:49.720 --> 13:50.679
-Uh-uh.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.799
Plus one goes in now
or not at all.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.039
-We'll take like five minutes.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.120
You're cool with that, right?

13:56.159 --> 13:57.519
-By myself?

13:57.559 --> 13:58.399
-We'll sort it.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.480
Five minutes.

13:59.519 --> 14:01.159
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.399
-Defining moment.

14:23.399 --> 14:31.320
[cha-cha music playing]

14:31.360 --> 14:32.679
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Pick
your partners.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.159
Ladies' choice.

14:51.759 --> 14:53.679
-Excuse me.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.519
Hi.

14:55.559 --> 14:59.039
Um, my friend has my phone
and my money inside.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.440
Can I just go in and grab
them and then I'll

15:00.480 --> 15:02.320
come straight out?

15:02.360 --> 15:05.120
I'm not lying.

15:05.159 --> 15:06.559
-How about you call your mum and
tell her to come pick you

15:06.600 --> 15:07.639
up?

15:07.679 --> 15:09.440
-But my friend will
come back for me.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.279
-Look, I'll tell you
this for now.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.200
If you're not on the list,
I can't let you

15:13.240 --> 15:15.480
through the door tonight.

15:15.519 --> 15:18.240
-The thing is I didn't even
want to come tonight.

15:18.279 --> 15:21.039
And now, I'm stuck here in
the middle of nowhere.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.639
And I've got class tomorrow.

15:22.679 --> 15:23.240
KAT (OFFSCREEN): It's Kat.

15:23.279 --> 15:24.080
Don't speak.

15:24.120 --> 15:24.559
I don't want to talk about it.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.360
-Voice mail.

15:26.399 --> 15:27.799
Can I make one more call?

15:34.279 --> 15:35.240
-Hey, Ethan.

15:35.279 --> 15:36.480
It's me.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.399
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): And five,
six, seven, eight.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.200
Step back, cha cha cha.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.080
Step back, cha cha cha.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.320
Step, tap, step, tap.

15:52.360 --> 15:58.679
One, two, three, kick, back,
kick, one, two, cha cha cha.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.559
-You must be the
famous Abigail.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.799
-I was leaving.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.480
-May I have this dance?

16:09.519 --> 16:12.159
-Go on, Abigail, make his day.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.799
-Aha.

16:31.559 --> 16:34.320
Now, the gentleman is
supposed to lead.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.519
Just go with me.

16:38.559 --> 16:40.440
Lovely.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.200
-You came.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.200
-Look, not?

16:43.240 --> 16:44.399
I'm dancing.

16:55.559 --> 16:57.480
-The third game of my
first season in

16:57.519 --> 17:00.480
NRL, and I get crunched.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.399
I did my ACL right here.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.118
-Oh, that's terrible.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.400
-Yeah.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.480
My family had flown to Australia
to come and watch.

17:07.519 --> 17:10.200
They saw the whole thing.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.118
-According to Ethan, your
life's in danger.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.319
-Christian!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.160
Bye.

17:27.598 --> 17:30.599
-Bub Lieberman took
a shine to you.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.640
-[inaudible], you behave
yourself now.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.400
She thinks that you could do
with more meat on your bones.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.039
She, uh--

17:38.079 --> 17:39.680
she's offered to cook you
her special dumplings.

17:42.799 --> 17:46.160
-You have to stop hassling
me about food.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.400
-That's not what I was doing.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.440
-It makes it harder.

17:54.079 --> 18:01.640
-With last semester, what
happened, I feel responsible.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.559
-It had nothing to
do with you.

18:02.599 --> 18:05.599
-But maybe I could
have helped.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.079
-You couldn't have.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.279
No one could.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.359
-Hi, uh, my friend was
just waiting here.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.319
Yea tall, cute little dress,
big Bambi eyes.

18:20.359 --> 18:21.759
-She left.

18:21.799 --> 18:23.640
Her boyfriend came and collected
her in a cab.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.240
-20 minutes till curfew.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.440
Let's walk really slow.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.359
OK.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.519
Changed my mind--

18:42.559 --> 18:43.359
giant steps.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.599
-Giant?

18:44.640 --> 18:47.079
OK.

18:47.119 --> 18:51.079
Stop right there.

18:51.119 --> 18:53.599
Race you to the end
of the park.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.200
-All right.

18:55.240 --> 18:55.839
Ready?

18:55.880 --> 18:56.480
-You're going down.

18:56.519 --> 18:58.160
-Set--

18:58.200 --> 18:59.319
-Cheat!

19:06.359 --> 19:07.480
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Yes!

20:19.119 --> 20:22.319
-Why are you going
out with Ethan?

20:22.359 --> 20:23.480
-What?

20:23.519 --> 20:24.680
-Oh, I'm just asking.

20:27.319 --> 20:30.480
-Because he's perfect--

20:30.519 --> 20:34.160
in every way.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.400
-OK.

20:37.519 --> 20:41.039
-You may not see it, but I
feel it, and I really--

20:41.079 --> 20:42.480
-I said, OK.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.640
-Train's coming.

21:01.359 --> 21:02.160
We should get going.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.359
We'll miss curfew.

21:54.839 --> 21:56.799
-That's mine.

21:56.839 --> 21:58.240
-You're the one who
moved things.

21:58.279 --> 22:00.359
If there's a pillow
thief, it's you.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.200
-You're right.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.119
I'm sorry.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.720
I can't sleep.

22:03.759 --> 22:06.160
Kat's not home.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
-Four students didn't make
the half year cut.

22:08.440 --> 22:12.160
You'd think it'd be time
to get serious.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.359
Your bed's still empty, if you
don't want to be trampled by

22:14.400 --> 22:16.200
Kat climbing through a window.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.640
-Isn't the room tidier
without me?

22:18.680 --> 22:19.799
-Yes.

22:27.839 --> 22:29.440
COUNSELOR (OFFSCREEN):
This is important--

22:29.480 --> 22:32.799
being honest to friends about
what you need, giving up some

22:32.839 --> 22:33.680
control to let them.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.400
It's brave and strong--

22:37.440 --> 22:39.319
healthy.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.640
-Thank you.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.519
-You understand that
we support you--

22:43.559 --> 22:46.480
your parents, your teachers,
your friends?

22:46.519 --> 22:48.240
-Yeah.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.640
-Recovery isn't always smooth.

22:51.680 --> 22:54.799
If you need me, I'm here.

22:54.839 --> 22:57.240
-I know.

22:57.279 --> 23:00.640
-So when were you gonna ask
to go back to dancing?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.599
-I guess you'll tell
me when I'm ready.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.640
-I am so sorry.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.599
If it makes it any better,
standing with in the queue was

23:12.640 --> 23:13.799
the most fun I had all night.

23:13.839 --> 23:15.599
-And the Kiefers?

23:15.640 --> 23:17.160
-They didn't show.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.480
And diplobrat's friends
are really hard work.

23:19.519 --> 23:21.039
-Well, I think I'm gonna move
back in with Abigail.

23:21.079 --> 23:23.599
I feel bad leaving
her on her own.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.079
-Oh, that's OK.

23:25.119 --> 23:27.599
Our friendship probably gonna
survive us living together.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.799
I belong in small doses.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.599
-I heard you've been practicing
your cha cha.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.160
-Sammy, please, enough
with the cha cha.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.400
-Look.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.640
Ready.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.799
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I already miss
the wide eyed girl from

23:42.839 --> 23:44.279
[inaudible].

23:44.319 --> 23:46.480
Sure, she didn't have a clue.

23:46.519 --> 23:49.160
But there's a kind of
freedom in that.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.319
Not knowing stuff makes things
less complicated.

23:53.359 --> 23:55.200
-Mind if I cut in?

23:55.240 --> 23:56.559
-Oh, hi.

23:56.599 --> 23:57.640
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN):
What, did you

23:57.680 --> 23:58.400
forget you had a boyfriend?

23:58.440 --> 23:59.480
TARA (OFFSCREEN): No.
