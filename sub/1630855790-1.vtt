You uh, finish your algebra?

08:39.226 --> 08:40.025
Uh..

08:40.227 --> 08:41.027
Pony!

08:41.227 --> 08:43.966
I'll get to it, okay, if you play one with me.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.660
You just want me to play

08:46.726 --> 08:48.172
because you can beat me at this one.

08:48.238 --> 08:49.051
Um yeah, duh.

08:50.526 --> 08:51.961
Algebra is stupid anyways.

08:52.027 --> 08:54.462
It's not stupid. I happen to have a BS in math.

08:54.528 --> 08:55.591
BS, that's right.

08:57.526 --> 09:00.460
I don't need algebra, I'm going to be a graphic designer.

09:00.526 --> 09:02.461
Well you still need it for troubleshooting.

09:02.527 --> 09:05.462
It's solving the mystery of the mysterious madam X

09:05.528 --> 09:07.528
and her relationship with Mr. Y.

09:08.026 --> 09:09.214
Mysterious mystery?

09:09.726 --> 09:11.976
Well I'm a math nerd not a novelist.

09:13.026 --> 09:14.589
You need to do your taxes

09:14.676 --> 09:16.364
I'll get you to do my taxes

09:16.477 --> 09:17.512
I'm not doing your taxes.

09:17.578 --> 09:19.713
So what, you're just going to let your little niece.

09:19.779 --> 09:20.579
Oh, niece.

09:20.780 --> 09:21.580
Rot in jail.

09:21.781 --> 09:24.366
Yeah, well if it'll teach you the value of Algebra

09:24.432 --> 09:27.432
it's worth 20 years in federal prison, I think.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.976
You know what? I'll do your laundry.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.960
Lord knows you don't know the
difference between colors and darks.

09:34.026 --> 09:35.961
How are browns and blacks not colors?

09:36.027 --> 09:37.162
I don't understand that

09:37.228 --> 09:38.028
and bleach.

09:38.129 --> 09:39.077
Don't get me started.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.464
Like I have to scrub my hands
like I'm some sort of surgeon

09:41.530 --> 09:43.718
and white spots all over the shirt.

09:43.831 --> 09:44.631
So naive.

09:44.732 --> 09:45.532
So helpless.

09:45.633 --> 09:46.968
But it's okay, I got your back

09:47.034 --> 09:48.534
like you got mine, right?

09:49.026 --> 09:51.828
Wow, maybe you ought to be a lawyer instead.

09:51.894 --> 09:54.329
Oh yeah, does it mean you don't have to do algebra?

09:54.395 --> 09:56.060
No, you'd still have to do algebra.

09:56.126 --> 09:56.926
Awe.

09:57.426 --> 09:58.861
Tell you what, you finish algebra

09:58.927 --> 10:00.362
I'll give you strawberry ice cream.

10:00.428 --> 10:01.428
What am I, nine?

10:02.226 --> 10:04.161
Okay, fine. No ice cream. Forget it.

10:04.227 --> 10:05.540
No, yes to ice cream.

10:06.028 --> 10:07.263
Always yes to ice cream.

10:07.329 --> 10:08.129
Okay.

10:11.726 --> 10:12.526
Ha!

10:13.026 --> 10:13.826
Beat ya'

10:14.027 --> 10:15.465
In your face math nerd.

10:16.028 --> 10:17.966
Wow, what is that, like, twice?

10:19.426 --> 10:20.926
Um, four times actually

10:21.028 --> 10:22.341
but I'm not counting.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.960
I finally found a game that I can beat you at, huh?

10:26.026 --> 10:26.826
Yep.

10:28.226 --> 10:30.539
Wait, you didn't let me win, did you?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.126
No.

10:32.227 --> 10:33.165
Oh God, come on

10:33.726 --> 10:35.726
did I actually win any of those?

10:35.827 --> 10:36.962
What are you talking about?

10:37.128 --> 10:38.163
You won fair and square.

10:38.229 --> 10:39.204
Oh my God, I hate you.

10:40.153 --> 10:40.953
Oh hey Dawn.

10:42.926 --> 10:45.489
We're making spaghetti, do you want some?

10:45.726 --> 10:46.789
No thanks. I ate.

10:47.126 --> 10:47.926
Okay.

10:48.027 --> 10:49.340
Roscoe is working late.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.789
Oh, um, you remember uncle Saul?

10:55.226 --> 10:56.026
He used to.

10:56.427 --> 10:58.262
Take us all out for Italian food.

10:58.328 --> 10:59.128
Oh yeah.

10:59.229 --> 11:01.165
He used to play dolls with me when I was little.

11:01.231 --> 11:02.031
Yeah.

11:03.026 --> 11:05.026
He... he passed away last night.

11:09.426 --> 11:10.739
The funeral's Friday.

11:11.026 --> 11:12.339
You don't have to go.

11:14.726 --> 11:16.164
Funerals remind me of...

11:17.526 --> 11:18.326
I know.

11:21.026 --> 11:23.214
Did he have schizophrenia like dad?

11:23.726 --> 11:24.526
Yeah.

11:26.426 --> 11:28.051
It must be a family curse.

11:28.227 --> 11:30.102
It's not a family curse, okay.

11:31.228 --> 11:33.963
Even if we inherited some predisposition to it

11:34.029 --> 11:36.279
there's still environmental factors.

11:37.146 --> 11:39.521
Don't listen to Claire, she's a gossip

11:39.726 --> 11:41.289
I read this Indian story.

11:41.727 --> 11:44.790
It says mental illness is caused by dark spirits.

11:45.926 --> 11:49.614
Well, we've got a dream
catcher so that'll block them out.

11:55.230 --> 11:56.165
I still miss them.

11:56.231 --> 11:57.031
I know.

11:58.726 --> 11:59.526
Me too.

12:00.778 --> 12:03.278
I had a dream that dad finally came home

12:05.226 --> 12:06.476
and mom was so happy

12:08.026 --> 12:11.026
we even played Monopoly on the kitchen table.

12:11.926 --> 12:12.726
Yeah.

12:19.027 --> 12:20.590
Ah, come on, no, stop it!

12:20.795 --> 12:22.130
All right we'll play another one.

12:22.196 --> 12:23.631
Okay, I'm gonna whip you this time.

12:23.697 --> 12:25.132
Oh yeah? We'll see about that.

12:25.198 --> 12:26.622
Oh I'm... I'm whipping you so bad

12:26.688 --> 12:27.507
you'll be wailing.

12:27.573 --> 12:28.373
Nah.

13:04.726 --> 13:07.160
Dawn he's got no right to say it's your fault.

13:07.226 --> 13:08.960
I mean, he was the one beating her

13:09.026 --> 13:10.961
I ought to go beat his ass, see how he likes it.

13:11.027 --> 13:13.527
No, no, just leave it be... leave it be.

13:15.026 --> 13:15.826
Okay.

13:16.226 --> 13:19.160
Stop crying then, shut off the water works then, okay?

13:19.226 --> 13:20.026
Okay?

13:20.626 --> 13:21.689
Forget about him.

13:22.726 --> 13:23.526
Okay?

13:24.026 --> 13:24.826
Yeah.

13:24.927 --> 13:25.865
You got me now.

13:28.326 --> 13:29.126
Okay?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.026
All right.

13:31.127 --> 13:32.862
All right, I'm gonna see you tonight, okay?

13:32.928 --> 13:33.728
Okay.

13:33.829 --> 13:35.142
Okay, all right, bye.

13:43.526 --> 13:44.326
Oh, hey.

13:52.688 --> 13:53.501
Are you okay?

13:54.312 --> 13:55.112
Yeah.

13:55.426 --> 13:57.926
Yeah, fine, just... just life, ya' know.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.851
Your darkest fear, Poni.

14:18.126 --> 14:18.926
Hey homie.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.326
Hey.

14:23.226 --> 14:25.414
Uncle Saul was generous, he left us

14:26.076 --> 14:28.201
a bumper sticker, some old diaries

14:28.926 --> 14:29.801
an Indian poem

14:30.326 --> 14:31.764
and the deed to a mine.

14:34.526 --> 14:37.061
Oh hey, this is the rain dance
that grandma used to make me do

14:37.127 --> 14:39.377
every time I went over to her house.

14:40.526 --> 14:41.326
Huh.

15:16.426 --> 15:18.301
Your darkest fear.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.876
I am coming for you.

15:41.726 --> 15:42.601
What happened?

15:44.626 --> 15:46.561
Nothing, I just got something in my eyes.

15:46.627 --> 15:47.427
Sorry.

15:50.026 --> 15:50.826
Oh hey.

15:50.943 --> 15:51.743
Hey.

15:51.813 --> 15:52.996
Did you get my text?

15:53.062 --> 15:54.197
Rosco, he's taking us out.

15:54.263 --> 15:57.460
Yeah, it's Friday, I thought we'd, yeah, go paint the town.

15:57.526 --> 15:58.326
Sounds good.

15:58.527 --> 16:00.277
Okay, cool, we'll get ready.

16:23.026 --> 16:24.839
Trapped... trapped.

16:27.726 --> 16:29.539
Trapped... trapped.

16:46.326 --> 16:47.126
You okay?

16:48.526 --> 16:51.026
Yeah... yeah, it's just a headache, um.

16:51.127 --> 16:51.927
Maybe we should go.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.368
No, no, no, I'll just go wash my face.

16:54.729 --> 16:55.542
No, it's fine

16:57.526 --> 16:58.326
Luke.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.526
Hey Luke.

17:00.226 --> 17:01.661
You know what your problem is?

17:01.727 --> 17:03.162
You just need to get laid.

17:03.228 --> 17:04.028
No, really.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.060
How about that chick over there?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.315
She's looking at you, I could tell.

17:11.226 --> 17:12.026
Relax.

17:12.276 --> 17:14.026
Hey honey melons, over here.

17:14.626 --> 17:15.425
What?

17:15.522 --> 17:16.323
What?

17:16.577 --> 17:17.712
That's a compliment.

17:17.778 --> 17:19.213
Hey, don't be sore sweet cheeks

17:19.279 --> 17:21.013
I just want you to meet my friend.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.204
You see that nerdy guy over there?

17:23.326 --> 17:27.060
Or maybe you're looking for
something a little more ferocious.

17:27.127 --> 17:27.926
Hey buddy.

17:28.127 --> 17:29.563
Why don't you leave the lady alone.

17:29.629 --> 17:30.429
Really man?

17:30.630 --> 17:31.505
Oh really man.

17:31.631 --> 17:34.560
Hey, I think I just saw someone
drive off with Samantha.

17:34.626 --> 17:35.439
What? Really?

17:35.627 --> 17:36.427
Yeah.

17:38.826 --> 17:39.626
Thank you.

17:43.526 --> 17:46.526
It's fine, you're tripping, you're seeing things.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.401
Trapped... in your mind, your mind...

17:54.026 --> 17:55.214
Watching.

18:00.926 --> 18:04.489
I am coming, Poni, to take over your mind.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.914
You seem to know how to handle him.

18:17.576 --> 18:19.201
You're kind of a surprise.

18:19.702 --> 18:21.577
You're quiet, but you step up.

18:23.726 --> 18:25.601
Most men would just turn away.

18:27.926 --> 18:29.489
Poni's lucky to have you.

18:30.126 --> 18:30.939
Niece, right?

18:31.127 --> 18:31.927
Yeah

18:32.128 --> 18:34.816
I moved in with her parents a few years ago

18:35.326 --> 18:37.764
now Poni's the only family I have left.

18:40.575 --> 18:42.013
It's a cute name, Poni.

18:43.274 --> 18:45.142
It was her grandmother's idea.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.710
She was half Native American.

18:46.776 --> 18:47.576
Oh.

18:47.678 --> 18:48.478
Yeah.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.643
Wow, that's cool.

18:54.026 --> 18:56.089
So, you're a computer guy, right?

18:56.727 --> 18:57.527
Yeah.

18:59.226 --> 19:00.726
Do you make video games?

19:01.738 --> 19:02.538
I wish.

19:03.426 --> 19:05.801
No, I'm more of a database custodian.

19:08.226 --> 19:09.289
Why, do you play?

19:15.226 --> 19:19.160
I kind of have this unhealthy
need to kill zombies on a daily basis.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.761
Have you ever played Zombie Empire?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.390
Oh I play it all the time

19:22.726 --> 19:24.661
I hate those spider zombies though

19:24.727 --> 19:27.162
I know, right, they get me even that Hazmat suit.

19:27.228 --> 19:28.028
Oh yeah.

19:28.229 --> 19:29.464
And the tunnel of skulls.

19:29.530 --> 19:30.765
Mmm, no, I can't go in there

19:30.831 --> 19:33.366
my light always goes out and
it's just way too intense for me.

19:33.432 --> 19:34.232
No.

19:35.726 --> 19:37.161
Did you play Rogue Assassin?

19:37.227 --> 19:38.162
Or Merlin's Quest?

19:38.228 --> 19:39.041
All the time.

19:39.726 --> 19:40.526
Wow.

19:41.026 --> 19:43.589
I never would have pegged you as a gamer.

19:46.726 --> 19:48.061
Roscoe doesn't approve though

19:48.127 --> 19:50.127
so just keep it on the down low.

19:50.726 --> 19:52.414
Your secret's safe with me.

19:57.144 --> 19:59.379
I actually have been developing this game of my own

19:59.445 --> 20:00.508
called Afflicted.

20:01.926 --> 20:04.426
The idea is you go into this zombie zone

20:05.227 --> 20:07.462
and you need to collect rare plants and herbs

20:07.528 --> 20:09.963
and a specialist, you know, doctors and stuff

20:10.029 --> 20:12.010
try to create a cure to the disease.

20:12.076 --> 20:14.014
And you have 72 hours to do it.

20:14.626 --> 20:15.961
But you don't want to get killed

20:16.027 --> 20:17.962
you don't want your crew to get eaten and stuff

20:18.028 --> 20:19.263
so you have to fight that off

20:19.329 --> 20:21.560
while you're... while you're trying to make a cure.

20:21.626 --> 20:22.439
Why 72 hours?

20:23.507 --> 20:25.542
Because in the beginning of the game you get bitten

20:25.608 --> 20:29.233
and you only have 72 hours
before you turn into a zombie.

20:29.486 --> 20:31.424
So you're skills start changing

20:31.987 --> 20:33.362
your vision is blurred

20:33.576 --> 20:35.060
you have trouble hearing

20:35.126 --> 20:36.261
you start quaking, and so.

20:36.327 --> 20:37.163
That's so cool.

20:37.229 --> 20:38.029
Yeah, yeah.

20:38.131 --> 20:39.460
When does it come out?

20:39.526 --> 20:40.339
I don't know.

20:42.726 --> 20:46.289
Um, I pitched it some of
these funding places and stuff

20:46.460 --> 20:49.695
but they always want like a
track record of successful games

20:49.761 --> 20:51.324
or completed products, so.

20:51.762 --> 20:55.012
I finally started saving up money to fund it myself

20:55.163 --> 20:56.601
and Poni's dad got sick

20:58.564 --> 21:00.064
so I have hospital bills

21:00.365 --> 21:01.678
and the funeral costs

21:02.366 --> 21:03.804
and Poni's tuition, so.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.167
Sorry.

21:05.368 --> 21:07.303
Oh hey, it's, you know, it's family

21:07.369 --> 21:09.057
that's the priority, right?

21:10.626 --> 21:12.939
I should just be... happy to have a job.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.276
You shouldn't give up on
something you're passionate about.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.426
Thanks.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.427
Okay.

21:46.226 --> 21:47.101
Help yourself.

21:47.976 --> 21:48.776
Thanks.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.661
Want some milk?

21:50.727 --> 21:51.527
Yeah.

21:54.949 --> 21:56.762
This is artwork for the game.

22:00.791 --> 22:01.926
This looks amazing.

22:01.992 --> 22:02.792
Yeah.

22:03.643 --> 22:04.443
Thanks

22:04.544 --> 22:06.544
Luke, you have to get this made.

22:07.043 --> 22:07.843
Yeah.

22:07.926 --> 22:10.060
Poni said you guys inherited a mine?

22:10.126 --> 22:11.064
Oh yeah. But...

22:12.126 --> 22:14.251
It's been abandoned for 100 years.

22:14.726 --> 22:17.101
Grandpa used to call it the Hell Hole.

22:20.226 --> 22:21.660
You should take a look.

22:21.726 --> 22:24.960
Maybe you can make the money
you need to finish your game.

22:25.026 --> 22:28.776
I'm a computer nerd, I wouldn't
know the first thing to do.

22:29.243 --> 22:30.043
Yeah.

22:30.144 --> 22:30.944
Yeah?

22:31.098 --> 22:33.081
Besides, if it was worth anything, someone

22:33.147 --> 22:35.272
would have cashed in on it by now.

22:58.526 --> 23:00.194
You have to stop.

23:07.226 --> 23:08.026
No.

23:09.226 --> 23:10.601
If it goes any deeper,

23:12.226 --> 23:14.039
it's really going to hurt me.

23:23.226 --> 23:24.161
There's no barrier.

23:24.227 --> 23:25.915
You said it would be there.

23:28.726 --> 23:29.526
What?

23:29.926 --> 23:31.301
Why would it be there?

23:48.026 --> 23:48.826
Poni!

23:50.326 --> 23:51.126
Oh no!

23:51.327 --> 23:52.862
Oh... oh, it's not what it seems like.

23:52.928 --> 23:54.163
Please don't look at me.

23:54.229 --> 23:55.029
I'm sorry.

23:55.230 --> 23:56.855
She said she was in there.

24:01.026 --> 24:01.826
I'm sorry

24:02.127 --> 24:03.562
I'm sorry, I didn't want to do it.

24:03.628 --> 24:04.889
It's okay, it's all right.

24:04.955 --> 24:07.018
She wouldn't leave until...

24:07.526 --> 24:08.326
Who?

24:08.433 --> 24:10.360
She wouldn't leave until I do it.

24:10.426 --> 24:11.226
Who?

24:13.726 --> 24:14.526
Her.

24:16.881 --> 24:18.216
I'm taking you to the hospital.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.217
Oh we can't go.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.408
You need a doctor.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.476
She said if we go she will hurt you.

24:24.326 --> 24:26.389
She will make you crash your car.

24:26.526 --> 24:27.714
Listen to me, Poni,

24:28.026 --> 24:29.151
She can't hurt me.

24:29.326 --> 24:31.460
She can't hurt you if you don't let her.

24:31.526 --> 24:32.901
You control your mind.

24:34.526 --> 24:35.464
She killed dad.

24:39.226 --> 24:40.982
Stay away from her, you hear me?

24:41.048 --> 24:44.236
You want to get to her, you have to go through me.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.551
Luke?

25:32.326 --> 25:33.326
Are you kidding?

25:33.926 --> 25:36.739
She'd have killed you if I hadn't jumped in.

25:36.842 --> 25:38.155
You can't see it, but

25:38.298 --> 25:39.611
I mean, she's psycho.

25:39.726 --> 25:41.789
No, it's... it's just an episode.

25:42.027 --> 25:42.827
It'll pass.

25:45.226 --> 25:47.160
I don't want her back here, Luke

25:47.226 --> 25:48.539
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:51.126 --> 25:52.161
I don't know what to say

25:52.227 --> 25:53.562
I mean, she's a nice kid and all

25:53.628 --> 25:55.816
but you just can't trust her, okay?

25:56.429 --> 25:57.867
It's not safe for Dawn.

25:59.026 --> 25:59.826
I'm sorry.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.251
How could you not see this coming?

26:28.481 --> 26:29.916
It happened all of a sudden.

26:29.982 --> 26:31.417
She... she just had a headache.

26:31.483 --> 26:32.858
This is schizophrenia.

26:32.984 --> 26:34.419
It doesn't come on suddenly.

26:34.485 --> 26:37.048
Not even your father went down this fast.

26:37.526 --> 26:39.161
You must not have been paying attention.

26:39.227 --> 26:40.415
She's in bad shape.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.443
Look.

26:43.544 --> 26:47.669
This treatment you've requested
is still considered experimental.

26:48.226 --> 26:50.861
Well her father's doctor said
that if he had gotten this early on

26:50.927 --> 26:52.162
he might have gotten better

26:52.228 --> 26:53.163
I highly doubt it.

26:53.229 --> 26:54.964
She's only going to get worse without it.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.865
If you want this treatment so badly

26:56.931 --> 26:59.431
then transfer her to a private facility.

26:59.926 --> 27:01.261
I don't have that kind of money.

27:01.327 --> 27:05.015
Then be content with what the
government has provided you.

27:05.426 --> 27:06.989
You two have ten minutes.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.026
Hey.

27:11.526 --> 27:12.776
Oh my God, I'm sorry

27:12.860 --> 27:13.673
I'm so sorry.

27:13.861 --> 27:15.160
It's okay, it's fine.

27:15.226 --> 27:17.226
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:17.726 --> 27:19.164
I remember the outside.

27:21.026 --> 27:23.901
It's where dad went the first time, isn't it?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.060
How are you feeling?

27:27.309 --> 27:28.122
I don't know.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.060
The meds just make me tired.

27:31.726 --> 27:32.914
But when I'm alone.

27:34.926 --> 27:36.114
I know she's there.

27:37.126 --> 27:38.376
Especially at night.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.014
I'm tired but I can't sleep

27:42.127 --> 27:44.262
I'll have them give you something to help you sleep.

27:44.328 --> 27:45.128
No.

27:45.526 --> 27:47.261
That would drive her into my dreams

27:47.327 --> 27:49.827
and I won't have any place to escape to.

28:02.726 --> 28:04.914
I'm gonna get you out of this, Poni

28:05.226 --> 28:08.539
I just need you to hang on for a little while, okay?

28:10.326 --> 28:11.126
Luke?

28:11.926 --> 28:13.361
Can you promise me one thing?

28:13.427 --> 28:14.740
Absolutely. Anything.

28:15.526 --> 28:17.660
Separate your darks from your lights

28:17.726 --> 28:20.260
I can't have you coming in faded clothes.

28:20.326 --> 28:22.460
What would the other inmates think?

28:22.526 --> 28:23.961
Well you know I'm hopeless at that

28:24.027 --> 28:27.090
so you're just going to have to get better soon.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.526
White bear.

30:25.026 --> 30:25.826
Damn it!

30:32.026 --> 30:35.360
Then you could use that money
to get Poni into a better place.

30:35.426 --> 30:37.361
But we don't know if there's anything in there.

30:37.427 --> 30:38.662
You don't know if there ain't.

30:38.728 --> 30:40.026
You said they found gold, right?

30:40.092 --> 30:42.240
They didn't leave because the mine's dried up, right?

30:42.306 --> 30:44.562
I mean, there could be gold
just laying around in there.

30:44.628 --> 30:46.863
We just gotta go in there and roll it out in mine carts.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.964
There could be deposits of zinc and copper

30:49.030 --> 30:50.665
that weren't valuable then but are now.

30:50.731 --> 30:52.966
People are finding gold in
these old mines all the time.

30:53.032 --> 30:54.200
I saw this reality show

30:54.266 --> 30:55.501
where some guy made ten grand

30:55.567 --> 30:57.255
in these mines, in one day.

30:58.349 --> 31:00.284
But nobody's been there for a hundred years.

31:00.350 --> 31:01.785
What if the thing falls down?

31:01.851 --> 31:05.160
Come on, if it was going to fall,
it would have by now, you know?

31:05.226 --> 31:09.039
I'll tell you what, if you see
a tunnel that looks dangerous

31:09.426 --> 31:10.989
we'll block it off, okay?

31:12.526 --> 31:14.060
Isn't it at least worth a try?

31:14.126 --> 31:14.926
For Poni?

31:15.926 --> 31:16.864
Yeah, for Poni.

31:53.627 --> 31:55.127
Tell Luke death is near.

32:05.226 --> 32:07.789
There's no Indian curse.

32:33.087 --> 32:34.900
So that's the plan right now.

32:39.226 --> 32:41.226
You should forget about me, Luke

32:41.526 --> 32:43.214
and move on with your life.

32:48.726 --> 32:50.164
You're my family, Poni.

32:52.526 --> 32:54.214
I will do whatever it takes

32:54.327 --> 32:55.327
to get you well.

33:09.726 --> 33:10.726
You rat bastard!

33:11.926 --> 33:12.864
I'm a musician.

33:13.876 --> 33:17.189
You can't be a musician, Rod, if you never practice!

33:19.082 --> 33:20.270
I saved every penny

33:20.350 --> 33:21.285
for seven years

33:21.351 --> 33:22.726
and you go and blow it

33:22.819 --> 33:23.819
on a new guitar?

33:25.243 --> 33:26.043
Excuse me.

33:26.143 --> 33:26.943
What!?

33:27.043 --> 33:27.843
Whoa!

33:27.909 --> 33:28.709
Hey.

33:28.783 --> 33:29.596
Take it easy.

33:29.731 --> 33:30.966
Everything okay Annie Oakley?

33:31.032 --> 33:32.260
Everything is just peachy.

33:32.326 --> 33:33.264
We're not open.

33:33.726 --> 33:36.160
Do you know the road to Graveyard Valley?

33:36.226 --> 33:37.761
No, but if you hum a few bars

33:37.827 --> 33:39.077
I can give it a try.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.115
Old piano player joke.

33:42.767 --> 33:44.702
Why would you want to go to that God awful place?

33:44.768 --> 33:45.831
Oh, Um, research.

33:48.923 --> 33:50.173
About two miles down

33:50.424 --> 33:51.674
look for a dead tree

33:51.925 --> 33:53.760
and then a fence with a hole in it

33:53.826 --> 33:56.670
and then it's the second dirt road on the right.

33:56.736 --> 33:57.549
Okay, thanks.

34:33.726 --> 34:34.525
Is this it?

34:36.025 --> 34:36.826
I hope not.

34:44.926 --> 34:46.864
No cell phone service out here.

34:47.025 --> 34:49.159
We'll rent a sat phone for emergencies.

34:49.226 --> 34:50.664
No mine carts, no track

34:51.871 --> 34:53.670
I'll go to town to get supplies.

34:53.737 --> 34:54.960
I don't have much cash on me.

34:55.027 --> 34:56.965
Don't worry about it, I got it.

35:15.226 --> 35:16.026
Sorry.

35:16.127 --> 35:17.065
It's all right.

35:23.126 --> 35:24.861
So what would happen if our light went out.

35:24.927 --> 35:25.961
That would be a problem.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.090
It would get pretty dark in here.

35:28.625 --> 35:29.425
Oh yeah.

35:31.627 --> 35:35.262
Minors have been stuck in blacked
out mines for days sometimes

35:35.328 --> 35:36.328
and gotten lost.

35:37.368 --> 35:39.981
Some even died of thirst
before they found their way out.

35:40.047 --> 35:41.172
Others went crazy.

35:41.626 --> 35:44.876
One guy wrote his last words on a wall with a rock.

35:45.126 --> 35:46.361
But that won't happen to us.

35:46.427 --> 35:48.560
That's why we're stringing this rope.

35:48.626 --> 35:51.751
That way we can feel our way out if it gets dark.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.461
And we're using different colors for them.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.902
That way... that way we'll know what tunnel we're in.

36:01.726 --> 36:02.664
So this is red.

36:03.226 --> 36:04.226
We have a green.

36:06.726 --> 36:07.539
Blue, orange.

36:10.226 --> 36:12.660
And each post we put in will have a letter

36:12.726 --> 36:15.489
that way we'll know how far down the tunnel we are.

36:15.555 --> 36:17.493
Side tunnels will have numbers.

36:19.769 --> 36:22.332
So, you're part Native American, are you?

36:22.526 --> 36:23.651
Oh yeah, Shanowah.

36:24.336 --> 36:25.771
But the tribe is scattered now.

36:25.837 --> 36:27.772
There's no reservation or anything.

36:27.838 --> 36:29.401
Do you know the language?

36:30.064 --> 36:30.864
Some

36:31.576 --> 36:32.511
"kay-yo" means "come."

36:32.577 --> 36:34.460
"Tay-do" means "Don't do that."

36:34.526 --> 36:36.447
She used to make me do this crazy rain dance.

36:36.513 --> 36:40.076
She taught me about this
princess who sacrificed herself.

36:42.039 --> 36:43.727
Do you have an Indian name?

36:45.526 --> 36:46.560
Come on, you can tell me.

36:46.626 --> 36:47.689
Little White Cub.

36:48.588 --> 36:49.388
That's cute.

36:49.589 --> 36:50.389
Yeah, cute.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.864
Like, you know, my brothers were wolves and eagles

36:54.177 --> 36:55.512
and I was a white cub.

36:55.578 --> 36:59.536
Like I needed reminding that I
was the whitest kid in the family.

36:59.602 --> 37:01.602
The dyslexic runt of the litter.

37:01.926 --> 37:03.176
It's still a bear.

37:06.026 --> 37:10.339
She used to tell me that I was
going to grow up to be a great warrior.

37:11.326 --> 37:13.461
Don't tell Roscoe that, I'll never hear the end of it.

37:13.527 --> 37:14.715
Don't tell me what?

37:15.282 --> 37:17.030
Oh, um, you know, I think the green tunnel

37:17.096 --> 37:18.717
will be the best place for us to start.

37:18.783 --> 37:20.408
I'll show you where it is.

37:20.526 --> 37:21.961
What were you two doing down here?

37:22.027 --> 37:24.529
Nothing, just laying rope so we don't get lost.

37:24.795 --> 37:26.860
You keeping secrets from me now?

37:26.926 --> 37:30.301
No, it's just some nickname his grandmother gave him.

37:30.726 --> 37:31.539
It's nothing.

38:03.354 --> 38:04.917
Huh, a ventilation shaft.

38:40.926 --> 38:42.661
They don't hear what I hear.

38:42.727 --> 38:43.862
They won't see the evil.

38:43.928 --> 38:46.178
They... They won't see no evil, man!

38:49.118 --> 38:50.618
What are you looking at?

38:52.026 --> 38:53.761
I don't understand why they don't see.

38:53.827 --> 38:55.327
They don't see anything.

39:21.876 --> 39:22.676
She's mine.

40:05.526 --> 40:06.651
What's the matter?

40:06.726 --> 40:09.101
This... this guy with... with a rifle.

40:10.726 --> 40:11.526
What, where?

40:12.149 --> 40:12.949
He's gone.

40:13.850 --> 40:14.913
What did he want?

40:16.526 --> 40:17.339
I don't know.

40:25.326 --> 40:28.139
So you're telling me he saw a guy with a gun

40:29.127 --> 40:30.660
in the middle of the night

40:30.726 --> 40:31.976
and then just "poof"

40:32.376 --> 40:33.314
he disappeared.

40:33.926 --> 40:34.726
Huh?

40:35.280 --> 40:39.468
Well, come on, if they were gonna
kill us, they'd have just done it.

40:57.626 --> 40:58.439
Spooky place.

40:58.627 --> 40:59.427
Huh.

41:47.226 --> 41:49.079
It's a man's duty

41:49.145 --> 41:50.351
to protect his family.

41:54.626 --> 41:57.751
I was thinking about that guy you saw last night.

42:00.626 --> 42:03.689
I was thinking maybe it could have been a ghost.

42:05.926 --> 42:07.114
The sheriff, maybe.

42:11.626 --> 42:14.251
See, his whole family died in an epidemic.

42:14.626 --> 42:15.560
He went crazy.

42:15.626 --> 42:16.860
He walked into the desert

42:16.926 --> 42:18.864
and no one ever saw him again.

42:22.526 --> 42:24.461
I was probably still asleep at the time

42:24.527 --> 42:25.327
Luke?

42:26.426 --> 42:27.226
Luke.

42:27.426 --> 42:29.361
There's something really wrong with this place.

42:29.427 --> 42:30.552
Can't you feel it?

42:31.026 --> 42:32.061
Roscoe's more irritable.

42:32.127 --> 42:34.160
There's something wrong with your arm.

42:34.226 --> 42:37.226
I feel like someone's watching me all the time.

42:37.726 --> 42:39.351
None of us can sleep well.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.914
I really feel like we should leave.

42:43.226 --> 42:44.726
Leave? We just got here.

42:45.226 --> 42:46.351
This was your idea.

42:46.427 --> 42:47.962
I know, but maybe there's another way.

42:48.028 --> 42:49.663
There has to be another way

42:49.729 --> 42:50.964
I don't have another way

42:51.030 --> 42:52.165
I'm out of options.

42:52.231 --> 42:53.544
Poni's getting worse.

42:54.226 --> 42:55.026
And I can't.

42:57.726 --> 42:59.226
I can't let that happen.

43:14.726 --> 43:17.726
Roscoe's so stupid. He thinks...

43:20.938 --> 43:21.751
Damn coyotes.

43:30.226 --> 43:31.539
What am I doing here?

44:34.726 --> 44:35.526
I'm OK.

44:36.326 --> 44:37.126
All right.

44:37.926 --> 44:38.726
Okay.

44:39.726 --> 44:40.526
All right.

44:41.426 --> 44:42.226
Okay.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.463
Stop talking to yourself.

44:45.026 --> 44:45.826
Okay.

44:59.827 --> 45:00.627
Hey.

45:02.126 --> 45:02.926
Hey.

45:03.526 --> 45:04.464
Come on, let's go

45:13.526 --> 45:14.651
$1,900 for a rock!

45:18.626 --> 45:19.661
Hey, you worry too much.

45:19.727 --> 45:20.562
Don't shush me.

45:20.628 --> 45:21.963
I don't want anyone to hear.

45:22.029 --> 45:24.264
Hey, you know what I'm gonna do with my first million?

45:24.330 --> 45:25.130
What?

45:26.042 --> 45:26.842
Oh wait.

45:27.926 --> 45:30.489
I'm gonna open my own place, my own club.

45:31.726 --> 45:35.601
I'm gonna call it "It's about
god damn time I won something'".

45:36.826 --> 45:38.061
Oh, Hey, once you get Poni out

45:38.127 --> 45:40.127
you can start your game company.

45:40.526 --> 45:43.461
Yeah, and hire a match maker
and find the love of your life

45:43.527 --> 45:45.462
I already found the love of my life.

45:45.528 --> 45:46.341
You have her.

45:47.726 --> 45:48.526
To Samantha.

45:50.726 --> 45:52.851
I bought... I bought her from him.

45:53.110 --> 45:53.910
The Mustang.

45:54.111 --> 45:56.361
Hello, I'm covering for... oh great.

45:57.112 --> 45:58.362
Oh, hey, angry girl.

45:59.081 --> 46:00.081
I prefer Jessie.

46:01.081 --> 46:03.394
Oh, I'm Roscoe, and I'm gonna be rich

46:03.549 --> 46:05.484
I'm a rich... I'm gonna be... I'm a Richard.

46:05.550 --> 46:07.985
Yeah? You dig up something in Graveyard Valley?

46:08.051 --> 46:10.486
Uh, no, we just, you know, we're doing research

46:10.552 --> 46:15.427
and we'll... we'll write a novel about
Gravy Gulch and make a billion copies.

46:15.926 --> 46:17.989
I'm so happy for you, whoa, huge.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.060
Graveyard Valley

46:19.526 --> 46:20.839
is a dangerous place.

46:22.726 --> 46:24.414
It's no place for tourists.

46:26.526 --> 46:29.161
Don't mind him, his girlfriend died out there ages ago

46:29.227 --> 46:30.977
and it really messed him up.

46:33.647 --> 46:35.335
He says a ghost killed her.

46:35.968 --> 46:37.656
It's not a ghost, it's real

46:38.726 --> 46:40.861
And apparently his hearing is better than I thought.

46:40.927 --> 46:42.062
He saw something out there?

46:42.128 --> 46:44.066
Sagebrush sees a lot of things.

46:44.828 --> 46:47.266
Well, was it someone from the epidemic?

46:48.525 --> 46:50.713
Oh no, no there wasn't an epidemic.

46:51.648 --> 46:54.586
That's just what the locals tell the tourists.

46:55.226 --> 46:56.164
It's the curse.

46:57.726 --> 46:58.851
The curse is real.

47:01.026 --> 47:01.826
What curse?

47:03.926 --> 47:05.989
The Indians called place "Tay-do"

47:06.126 --> 47:07.061
which means cursed.

47:07.127 --> 47:10.690
So white people thought
meant as an Indian burial ground

47:10.928 --> 47:13.063
and named the place Graveyard Valley.

47:13.129 --> 47:14.879
No one wanted to live there.

47:16.184 --> 47:19.934
But then they found gold and
everyone wanted to live there.

47:20.052 --> 47:23.240
They didn't listen to me, that's why they're dead.

47:24.506 --> 47:26.256
That's why it's a graveyard.

47:27.588 --> 47:28.823
Nobody wants to listen.

47:28.889 --> 47:30.889
It's just... I don't understand.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.664
Really brightens up the place, right?

47:36.918 --> 47:38.293
He's our local artist.

47:38.519 --> 47:40.707
They tend to be a little eccentric.

47:41.614 --> 47:43.177
They found a lot of gold?

47:43.503 --> 47:44.303
Tons.

47:44.726 --> 47:45.914
It was a boom town.

47:47.426 --> 47:48.739
Thousands moved here.

47:49.488 --> 47:51.926
And then in one night that all changed.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.268
See those brothers?

47:56.526 --> 47:58.401
They owned a mine on the hill.

47:59.426 --> 48:00.239
The Dixons.

48:02.226 --> 48:04.476
They worked for months with no luck.

48:07.126 --> 48:10.001
Pushed themselves hard working day and night.

48:10.276 --> 48:12.276
Barely stopping to eat or sleep.

48:13.926 --> 48:15.239
They became paranoid.

48:16.526 --> 48:18.977
Thought people were sneaking into their mine

48:19.043 --> 48:20.454
and stealing their gold.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.208
They started hearing things

48:22.526 --> 48:23.589
and seeing things

48:24.526 --> 48:26.151
things that weren't there.

48:27.126 --> 48:28.376
Gradually going mad.

48:31.126 --> 48:32.376
So one fateful night

48:34.126 --> 48:35.387
they snuck into town and

48:35.453 --> 48:37.360
slaughtered 42 people in their beds.

48:37.426 --> 48:40.260
The sheriff heard his wife scream and he ran home

48:40.326 --> 48:41.761
but by the time he got there

48:41.827 --> 48:43.827
his whole family was slaughtered

48:44.726 --> 48:46.414
and the Dixons were gone.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.661
The sheriff and his deputies went into the mine

48:51.727 --> 48:53.227
but they never came out.

49:00.226 --> 49:01.976
What happened to the miners?

49:02.426 --> 49:04.487
Rumor has it, they hid out in the desert

49:04.553 --> 49:06.614
preparing to attack again.

49:07.426 --> 49:08.926
That freaked people out.

49:09.526 --> 49:11.839
And in two weeks it was a ghost town.

49:13.926 --> 49:15.360
You ever been out there?

49:15.426 --> 49:16.226
Yep.

49:16.426 --> 49:17.226
We all have.

49:17.808 --> 49:18.608
On dares.

49:19.614 --> 49:22.302
I dare you to walk through Graveyard Valley.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.064
I dare you to walk up to Hell Hole mine

49:25.227 --> 49:26.790
and say the miner's names.

49:27.526 --> 49:28.839
Wait, Hell Hole mine?

49:28.927 --> 49:29.727
Yeah.

49:30.726 --> 49:32.851
People have said they hear screams

49:33.426 --> 49:35.161
walking through Graveyard Valley

49:35.227 --> 49:36.477
digging in the mine.

49:37.626 --> 49:39.751
Some people have even seen ghosts.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.749
Of... of the sheriff?

49:43.226 --> 49:45.414
Sometimes, but mostly of the miners

49:47.226 --> 49:48.414
and a blonde woman.

49:49.926 --> 49:51.364
Pandora, they call her.

49:55.126 --> 49:57.761
Don't worry about it, they're just ghost stories.

49:59.526 --> 50:01.401
It's the living that haunt me.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.861
I have to get back to work

50:04.927 --> 50:07.302
but, um, if there's anything you need

50:11.226 --> 50:12.226
anything at all.

50:14.726 --> 50:16.039
I'm your huckleberry.

50:26.726 --> 50:28.351
You can't stop me.

50:36.029 --> 50:37.092
She's here, Poni.

50:40.972 --> 50:42.160
She's in our heads.

50:54.317 --> 50:55.442
We can't stop her.

51:10.710 --> 51:11.535
Stop it.

51:12.043 --> 51:12.843
Stop it.

51:13.760 --> 51:14.560
Stop!

51:15.043 --> 51:15.843
Stop!

51:18.626 --> 51:19.426
Hello?

51:19.726 --> 51:20.539
Mr. Townsend.

51:21.526 --> 51:22.714
This is Dr. Parker.

51:24.426 --> 51:25.561
Is everything okay?

51:25.627 --> 51:27.752
No. There was an incident tonight.

51:29.426 --> 51:30.489
But she's stable.

51:30.926 --> 51:31.801
She's resting.

51:32.326 --> 51:33.514
Well what happened?

51:33.593 --> 51:35.427
She claims that her roommate

51:35.493 --> 51:38.468
has been telling her that death is coming to her

51:38.926 --> 51:43.051
and that tonight, her roommate
smashed her head against the wall.

51:44.426 --> 51:46.460
So change her room or get her another roommate.

51:46.526 --> 51:49.151
Mr. Townsend, she never had a roommate.

51:51.726 --> 51:53.660
If you really want to go to another facility

51:53.726 --> 51:54.851
please do it soon.

51:56.526 --> 51:57.339
Okay, thanks.

52:39.526 --> 52:40.326
You okay?

52:42.326 --> 52:43.126
Yeah, yeah.

52:44.226 --> 52:45.026
You sure?

52:45.227 --> 52:46.027
I'm fine.

52:46.726 --> 52:47.789
Go back to sleep.

53:38.226 --> 53:39.026
Luke.

53:40.326 --> 53:41.126
You awake?

53:50.026 --> 53:50.826
Luke?

54:07.426 --> 54:08.686
Roscoe, Roscoe wake up.

54:08.752 --> 54:10.294
Something's wrong with Luke.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.095
Oh he's fine, go back to sleep.

54:12.161 --> 54:13.796
He's not fine, he's mumbling.

54:13.862 --> 54:15.197
He talks in his sleep.

54:15.263 --> 54:16.698
He's not asleep, he has a knife.

54:16.764 --> 54:18.499
Oh, the psycho miners and the ghost story.

54:18.565 --> 54:19.753
You're so gullible.

54:19.926 --> 54:20.994
It wasn't a dream.

54:21.060 --> 54:22.695
Then hit him in the head with a shovel.

54:22.761 --> 54:23.699
Leave me alone.

54:25.726 --> 54:26.789
Go back to sleep.

54:41.826 --> 54:42.626
Luke?

54:44.227 --> 54:45.415
Whoa, take it easy.

54:46.726 --> 54:47.539
Are you okay?

54:47.726 --> 54:48.526
No.

54:48.926 --> 54:50.176
What were you doing?

54:50.576 --> 54:51.376
When?

54:51.676 --> 54:53.239
A minute ago, over there.

54:54.926 --> 54:56.639
What, you think that was funny?

54:56.705 --> 54:59.643
I just went into the desert and just got back.

55:01.806 --> 55:02.740
You don't remember?

55:02.806 --> 55:03.681
Remember what?

55:10.626 --> 55:13.314
So your great grandfather was a psychopath?

55:13.726 --> 55:15.851
That's not the story we were told.

55:16.499 --> 55:17.374
I can see why.

55:18.526 --> 55:19.602
You've gotta understand,

55:19.768 --> 55:21.260
the Dixon brothers were like family.

55:22.626 --> 55:24.061
He came out west with them.

55:24.127 --> 55:25.627
When they died it was...

55:27.926 --> 55:29.677
A stagecoach driver found him

55:29.743 --> 55:32.676
wandering in the desert about a week later.

55:32.876 --> 55:34.939
So he had psychological problems.

55:35.526 --> 55:38.401
He was eventually put into a sanitarium, yes.

55:39.626 --> 55:41.189
Kind of like Poni is now?

55:43.126 --> 55:45.126
So you could snap at any minute.

55:46.726 --> 55:47.526
Dawn.

55:47.727 --> 55:48.527
Listen.

55:49.509 --> 55:50.947
I would never hurt you.

55:52.426 --> 55:53.331
You know Luke,

55:53.397 --> 55:56.176
men have been saying that to me all my life.

55:57.426 --> 55:58.489
And then they do.

56:03.626 --> 56:05.357
Wait, what-what are you doing?

56:05.423 --> 56:06.223
Come on!

56:07.326 --> 56:08.514
Oh my God, amazing.

56:08.626 --> 56:09.460
Babe, what are you.

56:09.526 --> 56:10.860
What are you, whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:10.926 --> 56:12.460
There's gold in there, I can feel it.

56:12.526 --> 56:13.360
What are you doing?

56:13.426 --> 56:14.660
Let's go, let's get in, let's.

56:14.726 --> 56:16.460
No, we can't do it, we can't go in there.

56:16.526 --> 56:17.860
Please, please, please, please.

56:17.926 --> 56:19.239
Like are you serious?

56:20.026 --> 56:22.401
All right, all right, you're so crazy.

57:00.835 --> 57:02.485
Let's go to town baby.

58:47.726 --> 58:49.539
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

58:50.226 --> 58:51.664
You think I don't know?

58:51.759 --> 58:53.693
You think I can't hear the two of you?

58:53.759 --> 58:55.693
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:55.759 --> 58:56.810
I have seen her, Victor,

58:56.876 --> 58:59.193
that blonde bitch you're screwing in here at night.

58:59.259 --> 59:01.493
There's nobody else, it's just me and you.

59:01.559 --> 59:02.493
You're the only woman.

59:34.193 --> 59:35.618
What are you doing?

59:47.726 --> 59:48.526
Amber!

59:50.526 --> 59:51.326
Amber!

59:55.326 --> 59:56.126
Amber!

01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:12.601
When are you going to let her go, man?

01:00:16.726 --> 01:00:18.101
Let's get a bottle.

01:00:19.126 --> 01:00:20.189
It's barely noon.

01:00:23.248 --> 01:00:24.373
What is it to you?

01:01:05.026 --> 01:01:06.901
Dawn, I got something for you.

01:01:07.226 --> 01:01:09.860
It's gonna help us get the coyotes
that's caused all the problems.

01:01:09.926 --> 01:01:10.860
It wasn't a coyote.

01:01:10.926 --> 01:01:12.989
Yeah, it catches people too.

01:01:14.726 --> 01:01:16.360
You want to do that to someone's leg?

01:01:16.426 --> 01:01:17.627
He's a claim jumper.

01:01:17.693 --> 01:01:19.027
This isn't the wild west, Roscoe.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.495
It's not going to cut his foot off,

01:01:20.561 --> 01:01:22.127
it's just going to scare him, you know?

01:01:22.193 --> 01:01:23.727
It's gonna scare him, he wears boots.

01:01:23.793 --> 01:01:25.094
What if he's not wearing boots?

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.894
Well it's going to teach him to wear boots.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.835
What if one of us steps in it?

01:01:29.026 --> 01:01:30.960
Why are you giving me so much flack, Dawn? Why?

01:01:31.026 --> 01:01:32.560
This is for you, for your protection.

01:01:32.626 --> 01:01:34.060
Because it's too dangerous, Roscoe.

01:01:34.126 --> 01:01:35.060
Can't you see that?

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.460
Oh I don't know what dangerous is

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.560
I'm stupid or something

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:39.560
I'm just a moron who shovels dirt for you, right?

01:01:39.626 --> 01:01:40.426
No!

01:01:40.527 --> 01:01:42.160
That what you're saying behind my back?

01:01:42.226 --> 01:01:44.360
What are you talking about? I would never said that.

01:01:44.426 --> 01:01:45.760
I'll show you what dangerous is.

01:01:45.826 --> 01:01:46.626
Wait! No!

01:01:46.693 --> 01:01:48.432
This is dangerous. Huh? Is this dangerous?

01:01:48.498 --> 01:01:49.302
Stop it! Stop!

01:01:49.368 --> 01:01:50.168
Roscoe!

01:01:50.243 --> 01:01:51.043
What?

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:52.160
Are you out of your mind?

01:01:52.226 --> 01:01:53.360
We were playing a game, man.

01:01:53.426 --> 01:01:55.364
Dawn likes it rough, okay Luke?

01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:54.826
Luke!

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:00.826
No!

01:03:18.426 --> 01:03:19.239
Come on! Come on!

01:03:20.826 --> 01:03:22.576
Where's the God damned gold!

01:03:23.526 --> 01:03:24.326
Son of a...

01:03:40.626 --> 01:03:41.426
Dawn?

01:03:42.726 --> 01:03:43.526
Dawn?

01:03:45.726 --> 01:03:46.539
Are you okay?

01:03:47.426 --> 01:03:48.364
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:49.889
Here's your water.

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:52.060
I'll take the wheelbarrow back.

01:03:52.126 --> 01:03:53.560
Are you sure? It's pretty heavy.

01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:54.426
I got it.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:55.893
Dawn, if I said something last

01:03:55.959 --> 01:03:57.709
night that I shouldn't have.

01:03:58.826 --> 01:03:59.626
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.976 --> 01:04:06.414
I know you're not like other men, Luke.

01:04:07.526 --> 01:04:09.089
But I have to be careful.

01:04:09.726 --> 01:04:11.789
Dawn, everything's gonna be okay.

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:14.439
No, it's not.

01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:52.660
Yeah, now were talking.

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:54.601
This is gonna get interesting now.

01:05:09.226 --> 01:05:10.164
Dawn?

01:05:11.926 --> 01:05:12.864
Dawn?

01:05:31.026 --> 01:05:31.826
Wait.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:03.926
Roscoe.

01:06:08.726 --> 01:06:09.526
Luke!

01:06:28.226 --> 01:06:29.026
Luke.

01:06:29.226 --> 01:06:30.414
What have you done?

01:06:50.226 --> 01:06:51.414
What are you doing?

01:06:54.026 --> 01:06:54.826
Come on.

01:06:56.726 --> 01:06:57.526
Dawn.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:06:58.601
What happened?

01:06:58.726 --> 01:06:59.660
Coyotes attacked him.

01:06:59.726 --> 01:07:00.526
What?

01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:02.601
It doesn't matter... I got it.

01:07:04.926 --> 01:07:05.726
Let's go.

01:07:05.827 --> 01:07:07.060
Let's get him on his back.

01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:08.560
It'll take him longer to bleed out.

01:07:08.626 --> 01:07:09.960
We got to get him to a hospital.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:10.826
We can't.

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:11.726
Why not?

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:12.760
I might have shot him.

01:07:12.826 --> 01:07:14.093
What were you thinking?

01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:15.093
Help me get him in.

01:07:15.159 --> 01:07:16.534
I was saving his life.

01:07:18.526 --> 01:07:19.460
Put pressure on it.

01:07:19.526 --> 01:07:20.901
I am, just go already.

01:07:21.035 --> 01:07:22.715
Keep it up sassy bitch.

01:07:40.526 --> 01:07:43.026
I have got to get out of this hell hole.

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:49.676
We should have gone to the hospital.

01:07:49.926 --> 01:07:51.460
Not with that gunshot wound.

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.760
Besides, we found him a vet

01:07:52.826 --> 01:07:53.761
patched up Luke good.

01:07:53.827 --> 01:07:55.860
Yeah, he also said we shouldn't leave him alone.

01:07:55.926 --> 01:07:57.360
What are you, his mother?

01:07:57.426 --> 01:07:58.226
He's fine.

01:07:59.526 --> 01:08:02.360
We'll check him when we get back to the motel.

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:03.860
Get a good night's sleep

01:08:03.926 --> 01:08:05.801
back to work bright and early.

01:08:06.926 --> 01:08:09.588
You can't be serious about going back there.

01:08:09.654 --> 01:08:12.029
You saw that coyote attack him, right?

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.556
I didn't see it exactly.

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:17.160
And to tell you the truth

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:19.060
I'm thinking he done it to himself.

01:08:19.126 --> 01:08:19.926
What?

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:22.160
You woke me up last night, right?

01:08:22.225 --> 01:08:23.760
Said he was acting weird, right?

01:08:23.826 --> 01:08:24.626
Yeah

01:08:24.826 --> 01:08:27.639
I'm thinking Luke might be getting, you know

01:08:28.326 --> 01:08:30.576
getting sick in the head, like Poni.

01:08:31.725 --> 01:08:32.663
Don't go there.

01:08:33.225 --> 01:08:35.413
Hey look, I'm not faulting' the guy.

01:08:35.526 --> 01:08:36.326
I'm not.

01:08:36.526 --> 01:08:38.660
If you're born that way, what are you gonna do, right?

01:08:38.725 --> 01:08:40.163
But we can't trust him.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:41.850
I gotta take over.

01:08:43.225 --> 01:08:44.350
I gotta take over.

01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:46.089
He's in no shape.

01:08:48.426 --> 01:08:49.225
Punk.

01:08:54.225 --> 01:08:55.413
Let's dance, come on.

01:08:57.426 --> 01:08:58.988
Let's dance, Dawn, come on!

01:09:01.026 --> 01:09:02.526
Come on Dawn, let's dance.

01:09:10.725 --> 01:09:13.725
You know, baby, we'll finally be alone tonight.

01:09:15.926 --> 01:09:17.113
No Luke to hear us.

01:09:19.626 --> 01:09:23.501
You must finally be getting to
be pretty horny by now, right?

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:24.526
Hmm?

01:09:25.126 --> 01:09:26.314
Roscoe... I want out.

01:09:33.026 --> 01:09:33.826
Out of what?

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:38.526
Out of us.

01:09:41.926 --> 01:09:44.238
You'll get out when I say you're out.

01:09:46.576 --> 01:09:47.376
Dance.

01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:51.225
What's wrong, Dawn, huh?

01:09:53.225 --> 01:09:55.160
Why, you wish it was his hand between your legs?

01:09:55.226 --> 01:09:56.026
Huh?

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.360
What are you talking about?

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:58.864
Like I don't have eyes.

01:09:59.026 --> 01:10:00.901
I see the way you look at him.

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:02.126
I see it!

01:10:03.726 --> 01:10:06.726
I hear you talking behind my back, the two of you.

01:10:07.226 --> 01:10:09.160
Now look, bitch, he may own that mine.

01:10:09.226 --> 01:10:10.414
But I own that ass!

01:10:12.026 --> 01:10:12.826
Got it!?

01:10:25.226 --> 01:10:26.560
Where's that artist guy?

01:10:26.626 --> 01:10:28.001
You should be resting.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.414
Where's that artist guy, Sagebrush?

01:10:32.826 --> 01:10:34.139
What happened to you?

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.401
I need to talk to you.

01:10:41.226 --> 01:10:43.539
Make an appointment with my secretary.

01:10:43.926 --> 01:10:44.864
I need to know.

01:10:45.226 --> 01:10:46.026
Back off!

01:10:46.926 --> 01:10:48.489
I need to know the truth.

01:10:49.726 --> 01:10:52.976
You can't handle the truth, do you understand that?

01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:54.339
I've seen it.

01:10:56.126 --> 01:10:56.926
Hmm, yeah.

01:11:08.126 --> 01:11:08.926
The curse.

01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:10.726
Satinka.

01:11:12.426 --> 01:11:14.676
A lot of people know her by Pandora.

01:11:17.726 --> 01:11:20.226
She was the daughter of the great chief.

01:11:21.726 --> 01:11:23.601
Sister of many great warriors.

01:11:24.526 --> 01:11:25.776
A niece to a shaman.

01:11:27.426 --> 01:11:30.301
A neighboring war tribe attacked the village.

01:11:31.226 --> 01:11:32.101
They raped her

01:11:32.526 --> 01:11:34.651
and began slaughtering our people.

01:11:34.726 --> 01:11:36.726
They were hopelessly outmatched.

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:40.851
The chief still believed he could drive them back

01:11:41.326 --> 01:11:43.514
but Satinka knew it was impossible.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:48.864
Facing total annihilation,
she made a terrible choice.

01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:52.064
A forbidden ceremony.

01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:55.589
She killed her father, the chief

01:11:59.326 --> 01:12:00.826
became a skin-walker.

01:12:01.326 --> 01:12:04.014
A creature that is not only fast and strong

01:12:05.126 --> 01:12:06.501
but able to transform.

01:12:07.976 --> 01:12:11.289
She single-handedly wiped out the whole other tribe.

01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:14.351
But her thirst for blood, it was blinding.

01:12:15.826 --> 01:12:19.326
She became crazy, and she
was attacking her own people.

01:12:23.726 --> 01:12:25.351
She killed her own people?

01:12:25.526 --> 01:12:28.160
A skin-walker forgets... They forget a family.

01:12:28.226 --> 01:12:29.260
They forget love.

01:12:29.326 --> 01:12:31.326
They lose sight of who they are.

01:12:32.926 --> 01:12:34.864
They can transform into anyone?

01:12:35.576 --> 01:12:37.201
It's a perfect imitation.

01:12:37.776 --> 01:12:39.910
Well, how can you tell if it's a skin-walker?

01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:42.789
It's weak if you flash a light in it's eyes.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.901
It's like coyote eyes.

01:12:46.526 --> 01:12:47.714
The light hurts it.

01:12:49.176 --> 01:12:51.864
It's power goes beyond the physical aspect.

01:12:52.176 --> 01:12:53.676
It whispers in your ear.

01:12:55.776 --> 01:12:57.839
It can cause things in your mind.

01:12:59.326 --> 01:13:01.076
It can cause hallucinations?

01:13:01.926 --> 01:13:02.726
Yeah.

01:13:03.426 --> 01:13:05.489
You know, it's not physical harm.

01:13:05.726 --> 01:13:06.526
It's mental.

01:13:11.526 --> 01:13:15.589
- A couple young warriors,
they, they trapped her in a cave.

01:13:18.626 --> 01:13:22.001
You can't seriously be saying that she's still alive.

01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:25.014
You said that you wanted to know the truth.

01:13:25.726 --> 01:13:28.976
You can't kill a skin-walker without destroying it.

01:13:32.376 --> 01:13:33.939
So why is it in the mine?

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:37.414
They were mining on the back side of the hill.

01:13:38.026 --> 01:13:39.714
And they dug into her lair.

01:13:41.026 --> 01:13:42.089
And let it loose.

01:13:43.026 --> 01:13:44.089
It killed Solomon

01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:45.626
Martin.

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.489
It massacred the Graveyard Valley

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:50.689
posing as Martin.

01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:54.060
Why did it go back into the mine then?

01:13:54.126 --> 01:13:57.001
It has to return to it's lair to heal itself.

01:13:59.026 --> 01:14:00.776
What about a knife or a gun?

01:14:01.776 --> 01:14:04.276
You can wound it, but you can't kill it.

01:14:05.776 --> 01:14:06.901
It's a skin-walker

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:08.470
it always heals.

01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:10.889
How do you know all this?

01:14:15.126 --> 01:14:16.689
There's this personal experience.

01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:19.826
Are you Shanowah.

01:14:20.826 --> 01:14:21.889
I'm half Shanowah.

01:14:22.326 --> 01:14:24.764
There's really no pure Shanowah no more.

01:14:26.076 --> 01:14:27.201
You're a Townsend.

01:14:28.776 --> 01:14:29.901
You have the mark.

01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:31.788
You have the curse

01:14:31.873 --> 01:14:32.770
don't you?

01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:35.301
I can feel it.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:40.351
Curse, what curse?

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:43.501
You'd have to ask Edward Townsend.

01:14:45.926 --> 01:14:49.176
All I know is all your descendants tend to go crazy.

01:14:52.926 --> 01:14:53.726
Poni.

01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:56.064
His niece is...

01:14:58.926 --> 01:15:02.051
But she's younger, does that mean it skipped him?

01:15:02.476 --> 01:15:06.039
Satinka has more power over
women because she's a woman.

01:15:07.376 --> 01:15:09.564
There must be some way to save her.

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:15.801
I searched for months.

01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:19.160
For months I searched for her.

01:15:19.226 --> 01:15:21.664
How could they think that I killed her?

01:15:21.826 --> 01:15:26.201
Sometimes at night I fool myself
into thinking she's still out there.

01:15:26.876 --> 01:15:28.376
Somewhere in the desert.

01:15:29.426 --> 01:15:31.693
I go out there and I search for her, but...

01:15:31.759 --> 01:15:32.559
Who?

01:15:33.526 --> 01:15:34.651
You can't stop it.

01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.264
You can't hide from it.

01:15:38.376 --> 01:15:39.189
Just get out.

01:15:39.277 --> 01:15:40.210
What about my niece?

01:15:40.276 --> 01:15:42.010
She's dead, don't you understand?

01:15:42.076 --> 01:15:44.810
It's your family, you're all gonna die in a nut house.

01:15:44.876 --> 01:15:46.314
Get me out! Get me out!

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.810
Get me out! Get me out!

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:48.676
No! No! No!

01:15:49.376 --> 01:15:50.176
No! No!

01:16:24.293 --> 01:16:25.973
♪ And when they lay me down

01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:29.765
in the cold, cold ground

01:16:33.085 --> 01:16:34.360
you will live on.

01:17:24.726 --> 01:17:27.910
On the stagecoach I caught that night.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.601
I met the woman I'd marry.

01:17:31.226 --> 01:17:32.026
With her

01:17:33.426 --> 01:17:35.360
it was easy to focus on our life together.

01:17:35.426 --> 01:17:37.426
Forget about any nonsense curse.

01:17:40.426 --> 01:17:42.926
Right up to the day I saw my newborn son

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.714
and the bite marks on his shoulder.

01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:48.126
Then I knew it was real.

01:18:24.335 --> 01:18:25.385
Oh, thank God.

01:19:00.076 --> 01:19:01.560
He can do it on his own.

01:19:01.626 --> 01:19:02.860
What about that thing?

01:19:02.926 --> 01:19:03.960
I killed it, remember?

01:19:04.026 --> 01:19:05.714
What if you didn't kill it?

01:19:06.126 --> 01:19:07.560
It doesn't like the light, right?

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:08.689
We've got lights.

01:19:10.076 --> 01:19:12.201
You're in no condition to do this.

01:19:13.476 --> 01:19:14.760
Hey, get to work Dawn.

01:19:14.826 --> 01:19:15.626
Here.

01:19:16.476 --> 01:19:17.698
That pile of dirt might have

01:19:17.764 --> 01:19:19.010
enough gold in it to save Poni.

01:19:19.076 --> 01:19:21.451
Have you forgotten we're here for her?

01:19:22.226 --> 01:19:23.026
Okay.

01:19:25.476 --> 01:19:27.110
Hey, I know you've been through a lot

01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:28.710
but we're almost there, right?

01:19:28.776 --> 01:19:29.710
You just stay focused.

01:19:29.776 --> 01:19:31.589
Anything happens, just holler

01:19:32.076 --> 01:19:34.451
and I'll come save you just like last time.

01:19:36.726 --> 01:19:38.914
You can't help Poni if you're dead.

01:19:40.126 --> 01:19:42.534
If you're not here when we come out for lunch

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600
I'll understand.

01:20:17.926 --> 01:20:18.739
Stupid bitch.

01:20:21.926 --> 01:20:22.726
Defying me.

01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.026
I'm the man.

01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:29.026
I'm the man

01:20:30.026 --> 01:20:31.401
And I give the orders.

01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:39.951
Oh

01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:48.018
Water.

01:20:50.643 --> 01:20:52.323
It's not exactly water but

01:20:53.376 --> 01:20:55.056
it'll do.

01:20:55.326 --> 01:20:56.126
Better than water.

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.740
It hurts. Not like water.

01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:09.960
You and your new boyfriend.

01:21:11.918 --> 01:21:12.718
We'll see.

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:14.385
We'll see, Luke.

01:23:11.726 --> 01:23:12.526
My, my.

01:23:13.226 --> 01:23:15.351
So much gold for one man to spend.

01:23:19.226 --> 01:23:21.160
Couldn't you just share a tiny bit

01:23:21.226 --> 01:23:22.289
with little old me?

01:24:01.626 --> 01:24:02.426
He's coming.

01:24:03.326 --> 01:24:04.889
The white bear is coming.

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.939
And he's going to defeat you.

01:24:16.326 --> 01:24:18.639
The doctor said to stay off that leg.

01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:20.151
I haven't got time.

01:24:20.676 --> 01:24:21.476
Luke!

01:24:21.676 --> 01:24:24.364
We're all gonna die if you don't stop this.

01:24:26.126 --> 01:24:27.564
This could take months.

01:24:27.726 --> 01:24:28.660
We don't have months.

01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:30.226
We won't survive months.

01:24:30.926 --> 01:24:31.726
Look at you.

01:24:33.226 --> 01:24:36.060
Look at... look at you, you're ready to collapse.

01:24:36.126 --> 01:24:37.314
If you do, I don't.

01:24:38.076 --> 01:24:40.139
I don't know what Roscoe will do.

01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:04.126
I never thought he could
turn into something like this.

01:25:07.526 --> 01:25:10.526
I knew he wasn't mister right, or whatever, but

01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:17.276
a girl has to take what she can get.

01:25:19.126 --> 01:25:20.751
Don't sell yourself short.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:24.639
You just need to find a good man.

01:25:26.726 --> 01:25:27.526
I did.

01:25:30.298 --> 01:25:31.098
No.

01:25:33.526 --> 01:25:37.276
No, you need someone who's...
Who's courageous and kind and

01:25:38.326 --> 01:25:40.826
doesn't drag you into his crazy schemes.

01:25:44.576 --> 01:25:47.576
Maybe I like being a part of his crazy schemes.

01:25:54.626 --> 01:25:56.064
Roscoe, we were just...

01:26:33.526 --> 01:26:34.526
You're my bitch.

01:26:35.326 --> 01:26:36.326
My bitch.

01:26:40.126 --> 01:26:41.126
Leave her alone.

01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:42.126
All right.

01:26:44.426 --> 01:26:47.051
You ever come near me again I'll kill you.

01:26:48.226 --> 01:26:49.026
Keep her.

01:26:57.526 --> 01:26:59.339
I told them not to go back in.

01:27:00.076 --> 01:27:02.076
I told them it was too dangerous.

01:27:02.626 --> 01:27:03.426
What?

01:27:04.026 --> 01:27:05.714
There were no bodies, gosh.

01:27:06.526 --> 01:27:07.589
No bodies officer

01:27:08.526 --> 01:27:10.651
ghost miners must have gotten them.

01:27:14.526 --> 01:27:16.339
I told them not to go back in.

01:27:18.926 --> 01:27:20.190
Get your stuff into the truck,

01:27:20.256 --> 01:27:21.360
I need to get my backpack.

01:27:21.426 --> 01:27:22.239
No, leave it.

01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:24.014
It's got the keys in there.

01:27:24.476 --> 01:27:25.276
It's okay.

01:27:25.726 --> 01:27:28.101
I think he's all fought out for today.

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:28.976
Be careful.

01:27:35.426 --> 01:27:39.051
Uh uh, I told them it was too
dangerous, you stupid bitch.

01:27:39.726 --> 01:27:40.789
You don't listen.

01:27:47.226 --> 01:27:48.026
Roscoe.

01:27:48.626 --> 01:27:49.426
Huh?

01:27:51.526 --> 01:27:52.326
Stop!

01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:32.814
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:36.126 --> 01:28:38.626
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?

01:28:48.226 --> 01:28:49.351
Dawn, we gotta go!

01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:55.160
Luke?

01:28:55.326 --> 01:28:56.126
Dawn!

01:29:15.526 --> 01:29:16.776
Dawn, where are you!

01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:18.976
Blue! I though you were in blue!

01:29:37.926 --> 01:29:38.726
No, no!

01:29:52.226 --> 01:29:53.026
Dawn!

01:29:53.726 --> 01:29:54.851
It's me, it's Luke.

01:29:55.126 --> 01:29:55.926
It’s okay.

01:29:56.976 --> 01:29:57.776
It's me.

01:30:04.226 --> 01:30:05.026
Come on.

01:30:22.076 --> 01:30:24.076
Oh no, no, no, I can't, I can't.

01:31:48.126 --> 01:31:48.926
I'm sorry.

01:31:55.226 --> 01:31:56.039
I'm so sorry.

01:31:56.226 --> 01:31:57.026
It's okay.

01:31:58.626 --> 01:31:59.564
I couldn't see.

01:33:02.826 --> 01:33:03.951
The town's too far.

01:33:04.276 --> 01:33:05.076
I know.

01:33:05.726 --> 01:33:07.360
Well you're not going back.

01:33:07.426 --> 01:33:08.226
I have to.

01:33:09.226 --> 01:33:10.360
The sat phone's there.

01:33:10.426 --> 01:33:11.860
What? No, that thing will kill you

01:33:11.926 --> 01:33:13.926
I'm not going in the mine, okay?

01:33:14.126 --> 01:33:15.860
I'm just gonna make a phone call.

01:33:15.926 --> 01:33:16.739
Call for help

01:33:17.126 --> 01:33:18.360
and come right back.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.760
You can leave the headlights on.

01:33:19.826 --> 01:33:21.264
No, I'm going with you.

01:33:21.726 --> 01:33:22.789
It's too dangerous.

01:33:23.376 --> 01:33:24.689
I'll take my chances.

01:33:25.776 --> 01:33:27.214
We're in this together.

01:33:34.968 --> 01:33:35.768
Okay

01:33:37.276 --> 01:33:38.076
He's coming.

01:33:39.126 --> 01:33:40.689
The white bear is coming.

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.426
We better hurry.

01:34:13.026 --> 01:34:13.826
Luke.

01:34:14.326 --> 01:34:15.660
We fought with Roscoe.

01:34:15.726 --> 01:34:16.526
Yeah.

01:34:16.726 --> 01:34:18.976
We have cuts and bruises everywhere.

01:34:19.926 --> 01:34:21.676
They'll think we killed him.

01:34:24.726 --> 01:34:26.351
You went back, didn't you?

01:34:26.426 --> 01:34:27.226
I had to.

01:34:29.502 --> 01:34:31.065
Look, that thing is loose

01:34:32.502 --> 01:34:33.440
Roscoe is dead.

01:34:35.326 --> 01:34:36.560
And our car ran out of gas.

01:34:36.626 --> 01:34:37.501
So call a cop.

01:34:38.126 --> 01:34:39.860
You know they're not going to believe me.

01:34:39.926 --> 01:34:40.761
You can't kill it.

01:34:40.827 --> 01:34:41.702
I have to try.

01:34:43.176 --> 01:34:44.110
It's killing Poni.

01:34:44.176 --> 01:34:45.801
You don't understand, man.

01:34:45.976 --> 01:34:47.289
It's a Shanowah thing.

01:34:47.527 --> 01:34:48.861
My grandmother was half Shanowah.

01:34:48.927 --> 01:34:49.865
Is that enough?

01:34:53.926 --> 01:34:54.726
White Bear.

01:34:56.126 --> 01:34:56.961
You're a Townsend.

01:34:57.027 --> 01:34:58.160
She didn't get to you.

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:00.160
Is there something wrong with your brain?

01:35:00.226 --> 01:35:01.026
What?

01:35:01.226 --> 01:35:04.039
What makes you different from your siblings?

01:35:04.126 --> 01:35:07.126
I don't know, I'm... I'm shorter, I'm dyslexic.

01:35:08.326 --> 01:35:09.326
You're dyslexic.

01:35:10.326 --> 01:35:11.701
You think differently.

01:35:12.276 --> 01:35:13.651
You can block her out.

01:35:14.818 --> 01:35:15.960
You're the white bear, bro.

01:35:18.126 --> 01:35:19.501
You're the White Bear.

01:35:20.526 --> 01:35:21.839
What do I need to do?

01:35:22.376 --> 01:35:23.376
There's a spell.

01:35:24.526 --> 01:35:26.026
There's a sacred dagger.

01:35:26.726 --> 01:35:27.851
I have everything.

01:35:29.126 --> 01:35:29.926
Hello?

01:35:30.726 --> 01:35:31.526
Hello?

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:32.826
Hello?

01:36:31.026 --> 01:36:31.826
Amber.

01:37:06.926 --> 01:37:07.726
Stop!

01:37:13.226 --> 01:37:14.026
Luke!

01:37:35.726 --> 01:37:36.568
No, no, no, no

01:37:41.226 --> 01:37:42.289
Luke, Luke, Luke!

01:37:43.426 --> 01:37:44.739
No, no, no!

01:38:08.226 --> 01:38:09.414
I know who you are.

01:38:12.467 --> 01:38:13.780
I know what happened.

01:38:14.726 --> 01:38:16.226
You became someone else.

01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:30.676
Satinka.

01:40:21.626 --> 01:40:24.001
You gave up who you were to save them.

01:40:25.526 --> 01:40:26.589
And became the curse.

01:40:30.476 --> 01:40:31.276
The fire.

01:40:37.526 --> 01:40:38.964
It wasn't a rain dance.

01:40:45.026 --> 01:40:47.089
Mystu yakienimi tsipisisiwa ai apipottaw.

01:40:49.426 --> 01:40:51.051
Taistsipisii apipotook ki.

01:40:55.726 --> 01:40:56.526
Satinka.

01:40:59.183 --> 01:40:59.983
At last.

01:41:59.426 --> 01:42:00.489
Okay, wait, wait.

01:42:00.626 --> 01:42:01.461
Try again, fire.

01:42:01.527 --> 01:42:02.777
Okay.

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:04.510
Down this way?

01:42:04.951 --> 01:42:06.660
Yeah, just pretend you're being a zombie.

01:42:08.526 --> 01:42:09.460
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

01:42:09.526 --> 01:42:10.660
Don't kill him.

01:42:10.726 --> 01:42:11.526
Okay, okay.

01:42:12.026 --> 01:42:13.026
Oh... oh my God.

01:42:15.226 --> 01:42:16.026
Over there.

01:42:16.226 --> 01:42:17.789
Now you want to get that.

01:42:18.526 --> 01:42:20.060
Oh my God, what was that?

01:42:20.126 --> 01:42:20.961
What was that?

01:42:21.027 --> 01:42:21.827
What's that?

01:42:21.926 --> 01:42:22.739
What is that?

01:42:23.926 --> 01:42:24.739
I don't know.

01:42:27.226 --> 01:42:29.160
Go in, go in through the fire, through the fire.

01:42:29.233 --> 01:42:30.392
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:42:30.463 --> 01:42:31.263
Yeah, okay.

01:42:31.338 --> 01:42:32.898
Okay, oh... oh the fire, it's very big.

01:42:32.968 --> 01:42:34.181
