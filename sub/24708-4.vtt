12:19.905 --> 12:22.616
You wanna resolve it?
Look at these photos,

12:22.616 --> 12:24.285
'cause these will prove
who's being truthful.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.413
-What are these gonna be?
-Wedding photos
of me and Jesse.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.499
-Really?
-Look.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.626
That's Father Vega
doing the ceremony.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.879
Jesse and me
cutting the cake.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.506
-That's some big cake.
-Four tiers.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.884
Best wedding
I ever been to.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.095
So, Anna,
when'd you get married?

12:43.095 --> 12:46.849
Six months ago.
Two weeks after
the divorce came official.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.435
When you say
it came official, is that
what Jesse told you?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.812
I got the papers
in my panty drawer.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.399
-Is that right?
-Now, I'm returning
my girlfriend's wallet,

12:55.399 --> 12:57.359
right, who's the manicurist
over there?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.529
Here's the other one
talking like her and Jesse
are still married,

13:00.529 --> 13:05.951
which I walked on eggshells for
that woman three and half years
while she was his legal spouse.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.204
Anna, if I sent you home
with Officer Shannon,

13:08.204 --> 13:10.998
would you be able to get
those divorce papers
and the wedding license for me?

13:10.998 --> 13:13.042
That ought to help
some people back to reality.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.295
-Uh-huh.
-You know, Jerry Springer
did a whole theme show...

13:16.295 --> 13:19.548
on what's up with her--
"Denial's Not a River in Egypt."

13:22.802 --> 13:25.429
Detective Sipowicz
from the 15th Squad.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.390
We just faxed you
some photocopies
of stolen paintings...

13:28.390 --> 13:30.518
along with the squad
phone number.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.062
Appreciate your
returning the call
from the gallery there...

13:33.062 --> 13:35.815
when you return
from your long lunch.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.359
Thanks very much.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.070
Hi, my name's Donald Carter.
I was contacted
concerning my van?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.572
-Who contacted you, sir?
-I'm Detective Simone,
Mr. Carter.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.700
-You called about my van?
-Yeah, uh, why don't we go
and have a cup of coffee?

13:46.700 --> 13:49.620
-Andy, this is Mr. Carter.
-How's it going?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.956
Was it involved
in something?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.875
-Van's not
in your possession?
-No, it was stolen.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.003
-By a guy named
Larry Duncan.
-Have a seat.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.799
He's a hod carrier.
He worked for me,
like, five years ago.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.094
Calls me last month,
and I hire him back,
jerk that I am.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.221
He must've stolen it
from the site last night.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.974
-So, this guy was away?
-Just got out of Rikers.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.394
-You're sure he took it?
-I leave the van
at the site.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.939
I seen him watch me
stash the key in the visor,
like the jerk I am.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.983
He's been stealing stuff
the last week.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.735
So why didn't you report
the van stolen this morning?

14:21.735 --> 14:25.364
I was hoping he'd do what
he had to and bring it back,
and then I could fire his ass.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.616
He do something
real bad?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.952
Your van was involved
in a robbery where
some people got hurt.

14:29.952 --> 14:34.790
The title's in my name, but I
was home with my pregnant wife.
She'll confirm it.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.376
Were the people
hurt bad?

14:37.376 --> 14:40.713
-Where can we find Duncan?
-Alls I got's a beeper number.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.557
Uh, I went out
once last night...

14:51.557 --> 14:53.851
to the grocery
for, like, 15 minutes.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.312
My wife's pregnant.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.772
All she does is eat
Tang Tang noodles.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.036
I'm at a loss.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.205
Hey, Jesse,
give me a break.
That's not your signature?

15:15.205 --> 15:17.374
It looks close.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.669
That's your signature, Jesse.
And that's where you
signed Rosario's name.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.796
What, are you taking
their side, Martinez?

15:22.796 --> 15:25.007
-Whose delegate are you?
-I'm your delegate, Jesse.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.134
Trying to get you to
acknowledge the situation.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.094
You've been telling
half-truths all day.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.305
Either come clean now,
or I wash my hands of it.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.682
You could lose your shield
and everything else.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.559
I'm on the promotion list
for a second grade.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.312
You did a forgery here.
Grade promotion
is out the window...

15:38.312 --> 15:41.440
and your freedom in general,
unless you stand up.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.862
-I'm married to Rosario.
I said that.
-Mm-hmm.

15:46.862 --> 15:51.033
We are not divorced,
and Anna and I are not married.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.160
Where did you get
the divorce papers?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.372
I made 'em up.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.377
There's no seal,
but Anna didn't know
the difference.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.462
You got a judge's name
in here. Who's that?

16:03.462 --> 16:06.298
That's the first judge
I ever won a case with.
Figured it'd bring me luck.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.094
-What about the wedding?
-It was just a big party.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.222
The priest was a friend
who's trying to be an actor.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.600
-So you tricked Anna?
-If you want to put it
in those words.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.770
Are you prepared to make some
sort of gesture towards her...

16:19.770 --> 16:21.855
not to pursue
her legal remedies?

16:23.691 --> 16:26.986
I got to be with Rosario.
She's my wife.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.738
I was gonna divorce Anna
in a few months anyway.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.617
Jesse, what are you
prepared to do for Anna
to smooth the waters?

16:33.617 --> 16:37.413
She can keep the ring.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.165
-I'll take her on a trip.
-You're not gonna
take her on a trip.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.584
Well, what's
your concept, James?
What're you going for?

16:42.584 --> 16:46.296
I'm thinking
some financial gesture
with a sincere apology.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.844
I can do that.
I'm paying two
upkeeps as it is.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.096
Okay. Okay, that's what
I'm going for...

16:54.096 --> 16:56.557

of them withdrawing
their complaints.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.727

-Beautiful.

Got it. Thanks.

two collars for grand larceny.

Detectives, there's
a Mike Roberts on the phone.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.665

he's selling raffle tickets?

the Forsmann case.

-Yeah. He gave us

He was, uh, hooked up
with Terry Norton.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.902
Now they're looking at him
for cargo hijacks.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.821

23:27.739 --> 23:29.658
You know,
"Denial's Not a River
in Egypt," right?

23:29.658 --> 23:31.493
He's gonna face
some reality now.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.204
I'm not taking
a position on this, Anna.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.332
But, uh, Jesse wants you
to know that,

23:37.332 --> 23:40.085
if you saw your way clear
of not involving the department,

23:40.085 --> 23:42.671
he absolutely intends
looking out for you.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.048
Jesse thinks he keeps
taking sex off of me,
he's dreaming.

23:45.048 --> 23:49.219
I'm talking about financially.
Jesse's got no more ideas
in that other area.

23:50.971 --> 23:51.972
No, huh?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.975
Mm-mmm.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.060
I mean, my point is, Anna,

23:57.060 --> 24:02.190
assuming he's
financially supportive,

24:02.190 --> 24:04.693
would you, uh,
keep the job out of this?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.862
Uh, altered documents
and so forth.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.408
I want a three-way conversation
before I leave this building.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.535
I want an apology
in front of his wife,

24:13.535 --> 24:16.371
that she understands
I was misled.

24:16.371 --> 24:20.292
You don't figure it'd
be better more or less
to let the waters calm down?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.669
She hears him
apologize to me,

24:22.669 --> 24:26.089
or either I blow the whistle
on him to his bosses
and everyone else.

24:26.089 --> 24:30.385
Well, the assault
complaint, that--
that you've agreed to drop?

24:30.385 --> 24:34.055
I'm her in that shop
thinking I'm still married,

24:34.055 --> 24:36.057
I'd have swung
at me myself.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.063
(exhales)
Okay, uh--

24:42.063 --> 24:44.357
Just let me set up
the apology.

We'll try not to
hold you here too long, okay?

25:53.051 --> 25:55.845
Yeah. That's why I've been

25:55.845 --> 25:59.474

-I lifted some C.D.'s.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.434

26:01.434 --> 26:04.229
Well, you weren't working
in '88 and again in '93.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.523
Some special group
you wanted to listen to?

26:07.524 --> 26:10.151
You know
a Prince Laszlo Forsmann?

26:10.151 --> 26:13.029
-What's that?
-Answer his question.

26:13.029 --> 26:17.867
-No.
-He's the gentleman squeezing
your ass here, Amelia.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.662
The prince's apartment
was robbed this morning.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.789
I didn't have
anything to do with it.

26:22.789 --> 26:26.876
You got a brother
Larry, Amelia?
Took two collars for G.L.A.?

26:26.876 --> 26:29.963
So I dated Laszlo,
and my brother's
got a record.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.465
Big deal. I--
I don't even know
where Larry is.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.302
He's right next to you
and the prince there, Amelia.

26:35.302 --> 26:38.930
That's Larry supervising
Laszlo's grab-ass.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.808
What is any of this
have to do with a robbery?
Larry didn't do anything.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.019
Cut the crap, Amelia.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.105
Larry drove the van for
the robbery, and he loaded
on the paintings...

26:47.105 --> 26:49.608
belonged to the prince's wife--
that's minimum.

26:49.608 --> 26:54.195
Girl like yourself, Amelia--
you know, frequent access
to the prince's pants.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.323
Maybe you lifted
the apartment key.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.908
-Well, I didn't.
-Well, you better tell us
what you did do, all right?

26:58.908 --> 27:02.078
Because right now
you're looking real good
for acting in concert,

27:02.078 --> 27:05.999
-and that lady might die.
-I just tried to
help some people.

27:05.999 --> 27:11.129
-Starting with who?
-My brother was working for
this guy who was gonna fire him.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.007
Larry's got a record,
and it's hard for him
to find a job.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.468
You figured to tide
Larry over with a robbery?

27:16.468 --> 27:19.846
I didn't figure anything.
Laszlo wanted
to rip himself off.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.391
His wife doesn't pay him enough,
and getting found out with me
did not help his situation.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.601
His wife's got him on
allowance?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.353
She doesn't even give him an
allowance.

27:26.353 --> 27:30.231
-(gasps)
Can you imagine?
-He has to beg her all the time.

27:30.231 --> 27:33.276
He decided he was sick of it.
So he decided to sell
some of her paintings.

27:33.276 --> 27:36.279
-But first he had
to get 'em stolen?
-He worked that out with Larry.

27:36.279 --> 27:39.199
-I don't know about that.
-And did he work out
getting her skull beat in?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.701
Laszlo wouldn't
do something like that.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.286
How 'bout Larry?

27:44.746 --> 27:48.625
Larry's got a really
bad temper. Um-- (sniffs)

27:48.625 --> 27:52.087
It always screws him up.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.381

-No.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.936
-Yeah, Sergeant Lorenzo?
-Uh-huh.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.189
-I'll tell you, he don't
throw around compliments.
-How was your day?

35:50.189 --> 35:55.194
I, uh, had
delegate business.
It was, uh, wild.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.280
Guy married to
two different women.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.576
-Wow.
-I always figured one marriage
would be complicated enough.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.996
-A detective
in this precinct?
-I don't want to say any names.

36:04.996 --> 36:09.876
I guess it's how lawyers work,
the sense I didn't approve
of this guy very much,

36:09.876 --> 36:12.920
but I still felt
he deserved a delegate.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.006
Yeah, but you're
a better guy than a lawyer.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.925
Yeah, I-- I hope so.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.097
So, I was,
uh, wondering--

36:23.097 --> 36:25.683
You know,
I don't know how you're
gonna feel about this,

36:25.683 --> 36:29.145
but I thought you might
enjoy going somewhere
after work.

36:29.145 --> 36:32.899
Just the two of us.
We could have a beer
or whatever you like.

36:32.899 --> 36:37.195
I don't drink, but I'd like
to go out with you.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.198
Would you like to get
some dinner? Enjoy
Spanish food, Italian?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.617
-That'd be great.
-All right.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.369
-I'll be through
in about 20 minutes.
-Don't rush nothing.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.831
Keep on
the sarge's good side.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.168
-I'll meet you downstairs?
-Yeah. I'll meet you on
the first floor. All right?

36:54.712 --> 36:57.423
Let me get myself
some of this woman trouble.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.811
-So, did you get over
to headquarters?
-Yeah.

37:10.811 --> 37:14.941
They'll look to hook me
into the guy one of
the next couple nights.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.236
I can work my chart though,
boss, at least till we see
where it goes.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.279
So, what's
the downside, Diane?

37:20.279 --> 37:23.115
You know, there's, uh--
There's some behavior.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.368
Not too much behavior.

37:25.368 --> 37:30.039
Not unless the guy's
ready for a hell of
a slap on his wrist.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.083
How's the prince?

37:32.083 --> 37:35.962
Wants me to ask the girlfriend
to give up the watch he gave so
he don't have to use legal aid.

37:35.962 --> 37:39.840
-She's got to go for
that proposition?
-He's got two weak cases.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.635
You call the tune
on the behavior.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.845
Right.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.889
-Good night.
-Good night, Lieu.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.603
-Call the tune on what?
-Liery.

37:52.603 --> 37:56.023
-Oh, yeah, what's his act?
-I'm a big girl, Bobby.

37:56.023 --> 37:59.068
(scoffs)
Well, what's his behavior?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.407
We're a couple micks.
We drank.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.200
Great.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.953
I'll find other ways
to keep him amused.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.040
-Good night.
-Yep, good night.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.752
Good night, Bobby.

38:18.504 --> 38:20.464
Yeah, Greg. Good night.

38:27.346 --> 38:29.682
-Hey, James.
-Hey, Greg.

38:31.767 --> 38:34.270
I hear Jesse Ortiz had you
running around all day, huh?

38:34.270 --> 38:37.440
Yeah. My grandmother
used to tell me...

38:37.440 --> 38:40.359
God couldn't think up
the trouble for us
we get into ourselves.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.528
-Yeah.
-That's what this
put me in mind of.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.655
So, did you get his
problem straightened out?

38:44.655 --> 38:47.658
I think I kept him
from getting jammed up
departmentally.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.202
Einstein couldn't
straighten his problems out.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.209
You know, I--
I think I've lost
significantly more weight.

38:57.209 --> 39:00.087
Yeah? Why don't you
step on the scale?

39:00.087 --> 39:02.256
It's right in there, James,
but I'm not getting on.

39:02.256 --> 39:06.552
No interim weight-checking
was my approach coming in,
and I'm keeping to that.

39:06.552 --> 39:10.723
And-And what's interesting,
that the discipline
I've gotten off dieting,

39:10.723 --> 39:13.267
-now makes me capable of
keeping that word.
-Oh, yeah?

39:13.267 --> 39:15.394
Things might be looking
somewhat up for me too.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.772
Yeah? Good.
In what sense?

39:17.772 --> 39:19.732
I'm taking Gina
out for dinner.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.567
Yeah? That's great, James.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.403
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Yeah.

39:24.403 --> 39:28.282
So, what-what type of a meal
do you anticipate having?

39:28.282 --> 39:31.327
Oh, we're thinking
along the lines of
Spanish or Italian.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.080
And you know what, James?
Either of those nationalities,

39:34.080 --> 39:36.624
it's absolutely feasible
to dine sensibly.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.378
Yeah. Well, anyways,
I'll let you know
how it turns out.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.421
Providing I can
still see you.

39:42.421 --> 39:46.008
James, I turn sideways,
people question where I went.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.469
-(chuckles)
Night, Greg.
-Attaboy.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.237
What did the girlfriend
say on the watch?

40:06.237 --> 40:08.489
She said the prince
could go screw himself.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.283
Did you tell her
that was an "A" answer?
(chuckles)

40:12.660 --> 40:14.995
Where'd you go with Savino
and those loan sharks?

40:14.995 --> 40:18.791
You know, Savino,
he don't think they're right.
Says they stood a good tune-up.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.876
What's the matter?

40:23.629 --> 40:26.132
They got this one
going out on an undercover.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.467
-Why?
-Some guy
she worked before.

40:28.467 --> 40:30.678
I guess he's doing some
big stuff over at Kennedy.

40:30.678 --> 40:34.014
You might want to
have a talk with her,
connection with your program.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.225
-Behind what?
-Well, let her tell you.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.313
The guy liked to drink.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.482
Hey, I don't know
how to talk to her.

40:43.482 --> 40:47.153
-I don't know how
to talk about her.
-You're in love with her,

40:47.153 --> 40:50.072
and she is back.

40:50.072 --> 40:51.907
You're trying to
work it out.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.328
Not clearing
many cases lately.

40:56.328 --> 41:00.040
Did we not just
get over on the prince?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.334
There you go.

41:02.334 --> 41:07.089
That man probably had
private tutors his whole life.
