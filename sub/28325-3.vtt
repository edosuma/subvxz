00:31.605 --> 00:33.564
<i>"Baseball's a tough racket.</i>

00:33.770 --> 00:35.336
<i>"A few bad weeks and it's back</i>

00:35.373 --> 00:37.376
<i>"to the coal mines for you, pal.</i>

00:37.843 --> 00:41.604
<i>The pressure never lets up."
Duke Yipkowski.</i>

00:41.689 --> 00:43.259
<i>Boy, he was a kind man.</i>

00:43.296 --> 00:46.291
His nickname was, uh,
the Princely Pollock.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.371
When Ty Cobb went up in the stands

00:48.390 --> 00:50.799
and tried to stomp
a handicapped guy to death,

00:50.875 --> 00:53.560
<i>Yip was the only one who did
anything about it.</i>

00:53.711 --> 00:55.044
<i>He went right up there and said,</i>

00:55.238 --> 00:57.105
"Hey, knock it off."

00:57.182 --> 00:58.891
<i>Connie Mack said it best.</i>

00:58.947 --> 01:00.907
"Yip was a damn fine second baseman

01:00.953 --> 01:02.436
until the day he wasn't."

01:02.964 --> 01:05.153
<i>"The first one,
I gripped the ball funny</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:06.490
<i>"and it carried on me.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:09.046
<i>"The second one, I was trying to beat</i>

01:09.083 --> 01:11.147
<i>"a fast runner and overthrew.</i>

01:11.661 --> 01:14.829
<i>"" On the third, I took
my time and really aimed it.</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:17.851
<i>And that's when I forgot how
to throw altogether."</i>

01:18.067 --> 01:20.147
<i>The remarkable thing
was that he could make</i>

01:20.184 --> 01:21.213
<i>all the other throws:</i>

01:21.250 --> 01:22.842
<i>home, second, third.</i>

01:22.879 --> 01:25.779
But not the simplest one. To first.

01:25.883 --> 01:28.976
<i>"-" When the ball's hit to me,
the whole crowd takes a breath</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:31.152
<i>saving up their air to laugh."</i>

01:31.193 --> 01:34.358
<i>After committing 22 errors
in ten games,</i>

01:34.485 --> 01:35.965
<i>the Senators released him.</i>

01:36.077 --> 01:38.486
Two years later, Yip's dead.

01:38.570 --> 01:39.947
Some say having the game

01:39.984 --> 01:41.984
taken from him drove him insane.

01:42.104 --> 01:44.080
I would argue it was the syphilis.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.958
And he was not the only player
from the Deadball Era

01:46.995 --> 01:49.449
to die of a sexually
transmitted disease.

01:49.601 --> 01:53.194
Hugh "The Human Pooper Scooper"
Hooper was deeply committed

01:53.271 --> 01:54.817
to the scat lifestyle.

01:54.885 --> 01:57.349
He used to like to pay
prostitutes to squat

01:57.367 --> 01:59.686
- over a glass coffee table...
- You know what, Jim?

01:59.723 --> 02:01.169
I actually think we're good.

02:03.597 --> 02:04.852
I have a little more.

02:10.192 --> 02:12.055
<i>Why can't Gabby just give the count?</i>

02:12.425 --> 02:15.069
'Cause the play-by-play man
tells the story of the game.

02:15.106 --> 02:17.251
And the heartbeat of the game
is the count.

02:17.329 --> 02:18.586
How many balls, how many strikes.

02:18.623 --> 02:20.213
Every pitch changes the at-bat.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.562
Every at-bat changes the inning.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.173
Every inning changes the game.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.080
Whether the story I'm telling
is triumph or tragedy

02:26.117 --> 02:27.901
can come down to whether
the count is 1 and O

02:27.938 --> 02:29.339
or 1 and O.

02:29.398 --> 02:31.139
You just said "one and O" twice.

02:32.511 --> 02:34.936
But, hey, you came
to a meeting this morning.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.513
And that's a good sign.

02:36.595 --> 02:38.790
So just give yourself a little time.

02:39.013 --> 02:40.182
No.

02:40.276 --> 02:41.684
I don't have time, Shirley.

02:41.721 --> 02:43.237
The yips are like a missing child.

02:43.323 --> 02:45.078
The first 48 hours are everything.

02:45.173 --> 02:46.922
You don't solve it by then,
you might as well start

02:46.959 --> 02:49.951
checking dumpsters in ever
expanding concentric circles

02:49.988 --> 02:51.604
for what's left of my career.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.745
Damn it, I thought getting
sober was supposed

02:53.782 --> 02:56.537
to solve my problems,
not invent new ones.

02:56.574 --> 02:58.827
Sobriety just reveals the
problems you've been avoiding

02:58.864 --> 03:00.995
- with drugs and alcohol.
- Seriously?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.446
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause I got, like, 40 years

03:02.483 --> 03:03.761
of problems stacked up here.

03:03.798 --> 03:05.331
I can barely get through five seasons

03:05.368 --> 03:07.560
- of "Friday Night Lights."
- Oh, you should.

03:07.665 --> 03:08.920
It's really good.

03:08.957 --> 03:10.891
Yeah, well, after I watch
"Breaking Bad."

03:11.073 --> 03:12.488
You haven't seen "Breaking Bad"?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.266
Oh, don't binge shame me, Shirley.

03:14.286 --> 03:16.220
I'm barely hanging on here.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.180
Now, Simmons struggled last year,

03:18.217 --> 03:20.248
but he spent the off season
working with a batting coach

03:20.285 --> 03:21.784
- on his swing plane.
- Did he?

03:21.901 --> 03:24.358
Oh, good thing, too,
because that swing was harder

03:24.395 --> 03:26.750
to watch than a high school
production of "Equus."

03:26.787 --> 03:28.941
Fastball misses outside,
one ball to none.

03:28.995 --> 03:31.370
Not none... no... no tracks. Strike.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.402
Sorry, folks. Counts one and...

03:33.439 --> 03:35.412
one... one... one thing about baseball,

03:35.449 --> 03:38.633
it's a sport that we're all
watching right now together.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.744
Just missed a pitch as I said that.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.366
It was inside, so we add that
to the previous ball

03:43.403 --> 03:46.329
and we get a count of... I wanna say...

03:46.662 --> 03:48.026
"Mork & Mindy."

03:50.327 --> 03:52.155
"Mork & Mindy"?

03:52.588 --> 03:54.509
Well, I think that went pretty
well after I stopped trying

03:54.545 --> 03:55.705
to give the count.

03:55.742 --> 03:57.576
Kind of a fun change of pace
for the audience,

03:57.613 --> 03:59.689
not to know what the balls
and strikes were.

03:59.753 --> 04:02.615
Add a little, uh, sense
of mystery to the proceedings.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.584
Yeah, like, "What is happening?"

04:04.661 --> 04:08.159
And, "Did that man just say
the numbers tor and nevin?"

04:08.524 --> 04:09.801
That was a great deal more blunt

04:09.838 --> 04:11.621
than it needed to be, wasn't it?

04:11.943 --> 04:15.137
How about you, Gus? Any notes?

04:15.282 --> 04:16.781
I got one or twore.

04:18.183 --> 04:19.588
I'm just kidding.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.415
We're getting fired.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.201
Jim, you know,
I've seen this happen before.

04:24.295 --> 04:26.298
The catcher on my college team
got the yips.

04:26.335 --> 04:28.792
She suddenly just couldn't
throw back to the pitcher.

04:28.829 --> 04:31.714
Just the simplest soft toss
became impossible for her.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.230
Yeah, we were all scared
it was gonna last forever.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.241
- But it didn't.
- So, what'd the coach do?

04:36.278 --> 04:37.655
Did he move her to first base?

04:37.763 --> 04:39.001
DH? What?

04:39.038 --> 04:41.417
No, she k... she killed herself.

04:41.647 --> 04:43.413
Yeah, the floor was just
littered with pills.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.907
The cops theorized
she was trying to, like,

04:44.944 --> 04:46.320
throw them in her
mouth and she just kept

04:46.357 --> 04:47.862
missing over and over.

04:47.899 --> 04:49.495
So she eventually shot herself.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.175
On the fifth try.

04:51.278 --> 04:52.656
Why would you tell me that?

04:52.717 --> 04:54.991
To let you know this is serious.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.786
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm trying to...

04:56.805 --> 04:59.042
Okay, you know what the good news is?

04:59.097 --> 05:00.859
Spring training game on the radio.

05:00.951 --> 05:04.216
I doubt very highly that
anybody was listening to it.

05:05.002 --> 05:06.258
Right?

05:06.345 --> 05:09.036
I heard that entire game. Wow.

05:09.092 --> 05:11.764
It was just an endless parade
of suffering

05:11.801 --> 05:14.219
with no one offering any help.

05:14.256 --> 05:16.673
It was like the Flint,
Michigan, of broadcasts.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.334
How about laying off of me, huh?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.471
I thought being sick
was supposed to give

05:20.508 --> 05:22.398
- a person perspective.
- Oh, it does.

05:22.453 --> 05:25.177
I had a bird's eye view
to you eating shit down there.

05:25.262 --> 05:27.142
Gabby, on the other hand,
did a fine job.

05:27.179 --> 05:29.896
I'm gonna have her do color
on tomorrow's TV broadcast.

05:29.964 --> 05:31.210
- Uh-huh.
- Because I'm gonna take

05:31.247 --> 05:32.649
her spot in your booth

05:32.686 --> 05:35.790
so I can have a ringside seat
to your self-immolation.

05:35.827 --> 05:37.992
You know, this eighth grade
bully bluster of yours

05:38.029 --> 05:40.620
might play with the little
piss-ants who flit around you.

05:40.751 --> 05:43.149
Don't hold much truck with me,
Sonny Jim.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.917
See, I remember when you were
just a utility player

05:45.954 --> 05:47.233
whose main utility was

05:47.270 --> 05:48.756
grounding out to the shortstop.

05:48.793 --> 05:49.967
Didn't impress me then.

05:50.004 --> 05:52.184
You don't impress me now,
you jumped up,

05:52.221 --> 05:54.356
- dim-witted shit heel.
- Okay, who the hell

05:54.393 --> 05:56.149
do you think you are,
talking to me like that

05:56.186 --> 05:57.787
- in my ball park?
- Oh, unbunch your panties.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.498
That was me holding back. Keep it up.

05:59.549 --> 06:01.124
Happy to give it to you both barrels.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.359
I'll tell you what, Brockmire.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.059
Your ass better be ready for tomorrow.

06:04.096 --> 06:05.792
I will put you on the spot until

06:05.829 --> 06:07.800
anybody with a radio and ears,

06:07.837 --> 06:09.408
knows you can't do the count.

06:09.516 --> 06:11.867
Get ready for your next
public humiliation.

06:11.948 --> 06:14.480
Hey, I was born ready for humiliation.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.407
My mother gave birth
to me at a Dress Barn.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.050
Outlet store. On her break.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.913
And after,
they had her mop up our mess.

06:21.025 --> 06:23.889
So suck my balls!

06:26.406 --> 06:27.851
I don't understand,
I'm doing everything

06:27.888 --> 06:29.676
I'm supposed to do, to better myself.

06:29.713 --> 06:31.881
I've been... I've been collecting
these chips for a year now.

06:31.918 --> 06:34.362
When do I get to cash them
in for a better life?

06:34.533 --> 06:36.821
AA is not Chuck E. Cheese.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.229
Yeah, I know. It's worse.

06:38.266 --> 06:40.339
And Chuck E. Cheese is a parody
of a nightmare.

06:40.376 --> 06:43.253
Look, my career's gonna be
over in 24 hours, okay?

06:43.290 --> 06:44.931
For real, I need you to just sponsor

06:44.968 --> 06:47.015
the shit out of me right now, Shirley.

06:47.287 --> 06:51.399
So, uh, help me understand
what happens with these yips.

06:52.655 --> 06:54.665
It's like all of a sudden
there's a stadium filled

06:54.702 --> 06:55.937
with people inside my head,

06:55.974 --> 06:57.318
and they're all telling me what to do,

06:57.355 --> 06:58.770
but they're all saying
different things.

06:58.893 --> 07:01.458
And they're screaming all of
this at the top of their lungs.

07:01.584 --> 07:04.138
Also, they all happen to be me,
so they're doing it

07:04.175 --> 07:06.009
in a... in a really compelling way.

07:06.530 --> 07:08.885
Yeah, as always,
your narcissism astounds.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.532
Oh, thank you.

07:10.802 --> 07:13.424
But these anxieties you're describing,

07:13.461 --> 07:16.459
they're very normal
for this stage of sobriety.

07:16.586 --> 07:19.332
The fog has lifted
from your brain and now,

07:19.369 --> 07:20.802
all these competing thoughts

07:20.839 --> 07:22.424
are trying to assert themselves

07:22.461 --> 07:24.226
over your mind and your life.

07:24.349 --> 07:26.302
You need to rework step three.

07:26.468 --> 07:27.760
Admit you're powerless

07:27.797 --> 07:29.386
and that there's
a higher power in control.

07:29.423 --> 07:31.541
I know. Well, I didn't do that step.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.842
I don't understand.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.305
Well, I'm an atheist, Shirley.

07:34.342 --> 07:36.555
You know, I reject the story
of some sky daddy

07:36.592 --> 07:38.122
whose approval I'm supposed to beg for.

07:38.171 --> 07:41.881
I skipped all the steps
that had God in 'em.

07:42.102 --> 07:44.351
- Well, but that's most of the steps.
- I know.

07:44.388 --> 07:46.084
That's why I was able to blow
through the program

07:46.121 --> 07:47.171
in record time.

07:47.208 --> 07:50.125
Because you didn't actually
work the program.

07:50.442 --> 07:53.142
See, AA only works if you work it.

07:53.422 --> 07:57.251
Jim, your yips are directly
related to this issue.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.874
You're white-knuckling it and

07:58.911 --> 08:00.731
you're trying to control your life,

08:00.768 --> 08:02.015
and your sobriety.

08:02.052 --> 08:03.700
And you can't.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.468
So you need to find a higher
power that works for you

08:07.505 --> 08:09.239
or you're not gonna be able to fix it.

08:09.353 --> 08:12.824
Okay, so all I have to do is
find God in the next 24 hours.

08:12.865 --> 08:14.038
Is that what you're telling me?

08:14.075 --> 08:16.025
Oh, well, that should be a
snap, thank you.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.171
I mean, I don't even know
where to start.

08:18.690 --> 08:20.449
You could start here.

08:20.572 --> 08:22.238
At a Catholic church?

08:22.377 --> 08:24.193
Real life Slytherin? No.

08:24.331 --> 08:25.695
No, thank you.

08:25.815 --> 08:27.619
At least with Mormons
you get magic underwear

08:27.656 --> 08:28.855
and your own planet.

08:32.219 --> 08:34.642
- Hi.
- Oh, um,

08:34.679 --> 08:36.229
so, you don't... you don't call ahead?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.453
Oh, never. No.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.975
Can't send me to voicemail if
I'm standing on your doorstep.

08:40.104 --> 08:43.434
No, um, I was wondering,
are you headed to church

08:43.472 --> 08:44.848
this morning by any chance?

08:44.917 --> 08:46.156
I am.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.146
I wonder if I might come with you?

08:48.494 --> 08:50.152
Okay, let's do this.

08:50.189 --> 08:51.856
Uh, so this is Jim Brockmire.

08:51.939 --> 08:54.029
Oh, hi. What a pleasure.
Did she tell you?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.331
I'm one of those straight men,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.192
who prefers the company of lesbians.

08:57.242 --> 08:58.445
- No what?
- No.

08:58.482 --> 08:59.580
- You know, like a... like a...
- No, no, no.

08:59.616 --> 09:00.631
Remember, I told you,
that's not a thing.

09:00.668 --> 09:01.758
Well, we're making it a thing.

09:01.795 --> 09:03.458
This is how things
become things, Gabby.

09:03.517 --> 09:05.951
Uh, he wants to come to church with us.

09:06.199 --> 09:08.090
I think I'll catch a later service.

09:08.267 --> 09:09.708
Okay, well, just out of curiosity,

09:09.745 --> 09:11.952
is it because of your
preconceived notions about me

09:11.989 --> 09:13.970
or the fact that I referenced
your sexuality

09:14.007 --> 09:16.250
- on our first interaction?
- Both.

09:16.341 --> 09:18.139
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

09:18.431 --> 09:19.620
Solid.

09:24.301 --> 09:26.082
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

09:26.119 --> 09:27.417
- What's wrong?
- Aren't we at least

09:27.454 --> 09:28.556
going to a black church?

09:28.593 --> 09:30.935
I mean, I knew today was gonna
be a total write-off,

09:30.972 --> 09:32.990
but I was at least looking
forward to some great music

09:33.027 --> 09:34.408
and some pretty impressive hats.

09:34.445 --> 09:37.062
I mean, that's nothing but a
bunch of lame-ass white people.

09:37.353 --> 09:39.262
You're lame-ass white people.

09:39.299 --> 09:40.729
I know, and I think it's pretty obvious

09:40.766 --> 09:42.082
that I hate myself.

09:42.119 --> 09:43.869
This isn't my regular church,
all right?

09:43.906 --> 09:45.889
I don't live here, either, remember?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.218
But it's Episcopalian,

09:47.255 --> 09:48.535
it's, like, ten minutes from my house,

09:48.571 --> 09:50.377
and I think I saw
a pride flag inside once.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.247
Or maybe it was just a rainbow.
I don't know.

09:52.319 --> 09:53.835
I'm doing what I can. It's Florida.

09:53.883 --> 09:55.603
All right, let's just...
let's just do this thing.

09:55.648 --> 09:57.115
All right, but before we go in,

09:57.152 --> 09:58.607
you have to promise me...

09:58.644 --> 10:00.520
promise me that you're
not gonna embarrass me.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.744
Of course I promise you.

10:01.790 --> 10:03.115
Look, I appreciate you bringing me.

10:03.152 --> 10:04.310
I know how important it is

10:04.347 --> 10:05.650
to you, I don't take it lightly.

10:05.687 --> 10:08.154
Last thing in the world
I wanna do is embarrass you.

10:11.390 --> 10:12.581
Would you mind closing the door?

10:12.617 --> 10:14.005
Of course, Pastor.

10:29.077 --> 10:30.855
Why did you bring up the holocaust?

10:30.967 --> 10:32.062
Well, the priest is the one

10:32.099 --> 10:33.435
who brought up a benevolent God.

10:33.472 --> 10:35.080
I thought that called
for a rebuttal witness.

10:35.117 --> 10:37.454
No, you called Jesus
the Mayor of Auschwitz.

10:37.491 --> 10:40.099
Well, I don't wanna work
with some thin-skinned God

10:40.136 --> 10:41.577
who can't handle a little criticism.

10:41.614 --> 10:42.913
Now, if He's all-powerful,

10:42.950 --> 10:45.213
why doesn't he grow
Himself a pair of balls?

10:45.546 --> 10:48.223
Boy, I apologize again
for my behavior back there.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.329
Right now trying to control my emotions

10:50.366 --> 10:53.063
is a little bit like trying
to leash train a feral dog

10:53.100 --> 10:55.002
who has a taste for blood and trash.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.438
People are gonna get bit and
tampons are gonna get eaten.

10:57.475 --> 11:00.309
It's a... it's a process.

11:00.346 --> 11:02.847
Jim, feral dogs get put down.

11:02.947 --> 11:04.764
You know, maybe you
should stop apologizing

11:04.801 --> 11:08.059
for doing shitty things and
just stop doing shitty things.

11:08.161 --> 11:10.068
Well, maybe I should.

11:10.238 --> 11:12.875
Thank you for being such
a straight shooter, there.

11:12.941 --> 11:14.208
And thank you for bringing me here.

11:14.245 --> 11:16.170
This is... uh, boy, this is lovely.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.076
Yeah, I forgot how nice it is.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.341
Maybe Gayle and I will bring
our kid here one day.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.556
Oh, yeah, is that, uh,

11:21.593 --> 11:23.310
a thing that'll be happening soon?

11:23.577 --> 11:25.760
Yeah, I think, um... I hope very soon.

11:25.824 --> 11:28.072
Well, I think you're going
to be an amazing mother.

11:28.159 --> 11:30.174
- Ah.
- No, you're one of the finest people

11:30.211 --> 11:31.503
it's ever been my pleasure to know.

11:31.540 --> 11:32.819
I mean that.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.893
That's why I'm a little bit
surprised that you believe

11:34.930 --> 11:37.280
in an all-powerful God
who still had to supplement

11:37.317 --> 11:39.168
His income as a carpenter.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.009
Doesn't make sense.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.636
You know, there was
this moment right before

11:43.673 --> 11:45.597
my first College World Series game.

11:45.763 --> 11:48.281
I was stressed, nervous.

11:48.377 --> 11:50.737
So I got down, just said a quick

11:50.774 --> 11:52.397
prayer for strength,

11:52.574 --> 11:54.816
and when I stepped out onto the field,

11:54.916 --> 11:58.094
immediately this calm came over me.

11:58.255 --> 12:01.652
I felt connected to everything,
to the crowd,

12:01.716 --> 12:04.590
my teammates, to the bat in my hand.

12:04.826 --> 12:06.165
When that first pitch came,

12:06.202 --> 12:07.713
I knew it was going over the fence.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.714
Knew it as it left the pitcher's hand.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.692
In that moment,
I was sure I was exactly

12:14.729 --> 12:16.105
where I was supposed to be

12:16.142 --> 12:18.260
doing exactly what I
was supposed to be doing.

12:18.297 --> 12:20.238
I don't know.
If that's not a higher power,

12:20.275 --> 12:22.427
I don't know what is.

12:22.605 --> 12:24.271
Hmm.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.438
You know, that's the first time
that anyone has ever explained

12:27.475 --> 12:29.408
God to me in a way that
actually made sense.

12:29.445 --> 12:30.962
So, thank you.

12:33.176 --> 12:34.833
Now do the holocaust.

12:34.942 --> 12:36.668
- No.
- Do it.

12:36.896 --> 12:38.879
- No.
- Please?

12:39.461 --> 12:41.281
<i>Oh, Jim, I heard that Matt The Bat's</i>

12:41.318 --> 12:43.357
coming in to end your career today.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.167
- Where'd you hear that?
- He's telling everybody.

12:46.204 --> 12:47.891
I heard it from the bat boy.

12:48.169 --> 12:49.477
- Little Joaquin?
- Yeah.

12:49.525 --> 12:51.147
With the dimples and the bowl haircut?

12:51.184 --> 12:52.634
- He's so sweet.
- I know.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.836
Joaquin said that Matt's gonna, uh...

12:54.873 --> 12:57.415
to ear hole you with his monster cock.

12:57.888 --> 12:59.777
His English has gotten really good.

12:59.871 --> 13:01.293
Yeah, we're getting fired.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.858
So I'm going to the hotel.

13:02.895 --> 13:04.654
I'm gonna finish packing.

13:05.025 --> 13:07.245
Boy, you really know how
to harsh a guy's

13:07.322 --> 13:09.557
post-picnic high, you know that?

13:17.318 --> 13:19.719
All right, Sky Daddy,
let's do this thing.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.724
Oh, boy.

13:22.028 --> 13:24.200
God, I haven't been in this
position since I was looking

13:24.237 --> 13:27.781
for Sandy Duncan's glass eye
on a bathroom floor.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.052
She wouldn't have sex with me
unless we found it.

13:30.089 --> 13:31.553
Which we never did.

13:31.642 --> 13:33.405
Had to settle for a bunch
of mouth stuff.

13:33.442 --> 13:34.814
But this is probably
not a great prayer.

13:34.851 --> 13:38.436
Okay, I don't see any way out
of this stupid thing,

13:38.473 --> 13:40.784
and I was hoping
that you could show me.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.428
Please.

13:44.098 --> 13:45.720
I'll wait.

13:49.801 --> 13:51.401
Still waiting.

13:54.114 --> 13:55.948
Oh, my God. I feel something.

13:56.314 --> 13:59.727
Oh, it's like a pressure
deep down inside of me.

14:00.052 --> 14:01.972
Oh, shit. I just have to pee.

14:03.464 --> 14:07.517
Jim Brockmire just dominating
this urinal ice.

14:07.748 --> 14:11.205
So the rumors are true.
You really do talk to yourself.

14:11.323 --> 14:13.786
Yeah, but I don't talk
to strange men on the toilet.

14:13.988 --> 14:15.596
You're born alone. You die alone.

14:15.633 --> 14:16.875
You should shit alone.

14:18.752 --> 14:20.685
I was just taking a piss.

14:21.385 --> 14:23.578
I always use the stall
when I'm in public,

14:23.615 --> 14:25.052
otherwise everybody tries

14:25.089 --> 14:27.427
to get a peek at the big show.

14:27.469 --> 14:30.524
Which I guess makes me a bigger
attraction than you

14:30.561 --> 14:32.486
in the booth and in the John.

14:32.557 --> 14:33.898
Man, what is your problem?

14:33.935 --> 14:35.182
You know what? Never mind.

14:35.317 --> 14:37.982
- Not worth it.
- No, no, no. Don't hold back.

14:38.204 --> 14:40.534
Lay into me with both barrels.

14:40.674 --> 14:41.947
All right, fine.

14:42.045 --> 14:44.271
I'm gonna carve through you
like ice at a urinal.

14:44.372 --> 14:46.464
So open wide, motherfuck.

14:46.623 --> 14:49.042
'Cause here comes my mind piss.

14:49.111 --> 14:50.226
You are...

14:51.840 --> 14:53.173
Uh, all right. Well, we...

14:53.210 --> 14:54.317
We can do this later.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.227
Or maybe not at all.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.655
I'll... I'll see you in the booth.

14:58.692 --> 15:00.388
No, no.

15:00.763 --> 15:03.275
- Say what you were gonna say.
- No.

15:03.312 --> 15:06.190
Anybody vomiting from chemo
gets a pass from me.

15:06.227 --> 15:09.899
Oh, well, I stopped
chemo two weeks ago.

15:09.995 --> 15:11.276
Well, what does that mean?

15:11.340 --> 15:13.946
No, don't pretend to care.

15:14.023 --> 15:16.487
Don't treat me differently
because I'm sick.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.213
That... that's more insulting
than anything

15:18.250 --> 15:20.133
you could possibly say to me.

15:20.188 --> 15:21.788
What... now, you don't know
what I was gonna say.

15:21.824 --> 15:24.050
I need you to be honest with me.

15:24.336 --> 15:28.461
My friends and fans, doctors, my wife,

15:28.498 --> 15:30.413
none of them are honest.

15:30.487 --> 15:31.929
Nobody kicks cancer's ass.

15:31.966 --> 15:35.718
Cancer either almost kills you
or it kills you.

15:35.836 --> 15:38.336
And it's killing me,
and none of them will admit it.

15:38.373 --> 15:42.224
So, please, do me the goddamn
courtesy of some honesty.

15:42.377 --> 15:44.036
Okeydokey.

15:46.665 --> 15:47.901
Do it!

15:47.989 --> 15:49.056
- Now!
- Okay.

15:49.093 --> 15:51.237
You're a black-hearted piece of shit

15:51.274 --> 15:52.937
who's done more coke than Stevie Nicks

15:52.974 --> 15:54.461
and David Crosby combined.

15:54.498 --> 15:55.687
All true.

15:55.818 --> 15:57.255
Continue.

15:57.292 --> 15:58.967
Oh, boy. The four luckiest...

16:01.362 --> 16:03.917
The four luckiest women
in the world are the ones

16:03.954 --> 16:06.521
who managed to heave your
aggressively sinewy body

16:06.558 --> 16:09.300
off of them long enough to divorce you,

16:09.384 --> 16:10.714
taking with them the only part

16:10.751 --> 16:11.962
of you they ever actually loved,

16:11.999 --> 16:13.403
which was your money. All right?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.515
But that... you know what?
That's blood.

16:15.552 --> 16:16.792
So, you know what? We're gonna get you

16:16.828 --> 16:17.966
to the hospital.

16:18.003 --> 16:19.384
Don't worry. Once you feel better,

16:19.421 --> 16:20.463
I'll tell you all about the time

16:20.500 --> 16:22.525
- I fucked your sister.
- Which one?

16:22.758 --> 16:24.806
I gotta give you some reason
to get better, now don't I?

16:24.843 --> 16:26.234
Now... now, come on.

16:26.442 --> 16:28.292
Gus, I need you to call an ambulance.

16:28.373 --> 16:29.955
Yeah, okay.

16:30.158 --> 16:32.575
Now, please, Assy Joe.

16:40.401 --> 16:42.835
- Wow.
- What?

16:44.580 --> 16:47.340
- That was intense.
- Oh, yeah, man.

16:47.455 --> 16:50.389
You mean, like,
to witness the frailties

16:50.426 --> 16:51.842
of the human body like that?

16:51.916 --> 16:54.183
To see the mortal coil
laid bare before us.

16:54.248 --> 16:56.048
It was devastating.

16:56.152 --> 16:59.070
I mean, thank God the man
is okay or, uh,

16:59.287 --> 17:01.896
I do not think that I could continue.

17:03.842 --> 17:06.207
Jim, I don't think I've ever
seen you happier.

17:06.402 --> 17:07.819
Now, come on, Gu... I just...

17:07.856 --> 17:10.675
I'm excited to have my solo booth back.

17:10.712 --> 17:11.781
That's all.

17:11.818 --> 17:13.218
I don't know what
you're so excited about.

17:13.253 --> 17:14.904
You still got the yips.

17:15.227 --> 17:16.669
Plus you're solo at the mics,

17:16.705 --> 17:18.843
and now you got nobody to
help you with the count.

17:18.987 --> 17:21.896
That's great producing, Gus.
Really, thanks a lot.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.777
Great. Great pep talk.

17:36.929 --> 17:39.318
Come on. You can do it, you can do it.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.095
Hello, baseball fans.

17:41.132 --> 17:43.398
<i>Jim Brockmire with you today
flying solo</i>

17:43.435 --> 17:44.935
<i>through the friendly Florida skies,</i>

17:44.978 --> 17:48.254
so put your tray tables up
and fasten your seatbelts

17:48.291 --> 17:49.911
because you are in the center seat.

17:49.948 --> 17:51.646
I am in both the aisle and the window,

17:51.683 --> 17:53.606
and I am feeling chatty.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.130
Just about ready

17:55.167 --> 17:56.884
for the first pitch
here this afternoon.

17:56.921 --> 17:59.358
Sitko making his spring debut
on the mound,

17:59.395 --> 18:02.206
looking to bounce back from,
well, a pretty disastrous

18:02.243 --> 18:05.184
season last year where he had
about as much control

18:05.221 --> 18:08.281
as an Amish kid during
the Rumspringa at Burning Man.

18:08.405 --> 18:10.597
And déjà vu all over again.

18:10.848 --> 18:13.199
He begins this year much like
he ended the last,

18:13.236 --> 18:16.778
with a fast ball way outside
for a ball one and O.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.929
One ball and O strikes,
which is the count

18:19.966 --> 18:21.846
as it currently exists.

18:21.972 --> 18:24.419
<i>Sitko misses outside again.</i>

18:24.439 --> 18:27.773
Time, two and O.
Two balls and no strikes.

18:30.084 --> 18:33.001
Folks, we got ourselves a ball
game here this afternoon.

18:33.132 --> 18:35.170
Munich red hot thus far this spring.

18:35.207 --> 18:36.400
Eight for 13.

18:36.437 --> 18:37.700
No walks, no strike outs.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.663
Definitely looking to make contact.

18:40.087 --> 18:41.820
<i>That broadcast was fantastic.</i>

18:42.012 --> 18:43.529
<i>I just got off the phone
with the owners.</i>

18:43.621 --> 18:46.517
They loved that two-inning riff
on Bob Fosse's "Cabaret"

18:46.554 --> 18:47.697
and the way that you seamlessly

18:47.734 --> 18:49.153
dovetailed it right back into the game.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.215
Well, the parallels between Andujar

18:51.252 --> 18:52.932
and Sally Bowles,
that's just low-hanging fruit.

18:52.968 --> 18:55.282
I mean, I can't be the first
person who ever noticed that.

18:55.319 --> 18:58.140
Well, they said that this was
the quintessential Brockmire

18:58.177 --> 18:59.659
they wanted when they hired you.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.382
They're giving you a solo booth.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.705
- Get out of here.
- Yep.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.981
- That's incredible.
- I know.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.732
And they're excited
because now they get to save

19:05.769 --> 19:07.530
a ton of money when they fire Gabby.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.553
- They're gonna fire Gabby?
- Yeah.

19:09.590 --> 19:10.847
And could you do that for me?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.860
Because I'm not good at confrontation.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.359
What are you good at, Gus?

19:15.545 --> 19:16.693
Four way stops.

19:16.752 --> 19:17.996
I'm good at four way stops.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.532
I always know who to yield to.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.412
That's the... that's
the saddest brag ever.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.812
<i>That's the first time
you haven't done a share.</i>

19:26.872 --> 19:28.367
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.650
I'm not hiding anything
from you, Shirley.

19:30.797 --> 19:33.056
Took your note about the whole
higher power thing,

19:33.093 --> 19:35.666
and I reached out to God,
and He got right back to me.

19:37.019 --> 19:38.797
Turns out he's the Old Testament God.

19:38.876 --> 19:41.572
He smote my enemy
and he punished the innocent.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.713
Wh... what do you think
God did, exactly?

19:43.830 --> 19:45.359
He made Mat "The Bat" sick,

19:45.396 --> 19:46.891
so he couldn't call the ball game,

19:46.928 --> 19:49.152
and He gave me my solo booth back.

19:49.827 --> 19:52.643
Hmm. What about you partner?

19:52.794 --> 19:55.252
I have to fire her tomorrow.

19:55.614 --> 19:57.836
Remind me what happened
to your last partner.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.948
I fired him so I could get
a solo booth.

20:01.469 --> 20:03.569
Why?
You think these things are related?

20:03.721 --> 20:06.706
- Very much so.
- Huh.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.915
Anywhoodles, turns out I understand God

20:09.952 --> 20:11.268
a lot better than I thought I did.

20:11.326 --> 20:12.900
He runs a protection racket.

20:13.054 --> 20:15.161
You need something and you
can't turn to anybody

20:15.198 --> 20:16.893
in the mortal realm, you call on God,

20:16.930 --> 20:18.323
you ask Him for a favor.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.051
Someday... and that day
may never come...

20:20.144 --> 20:22.204
He asks you for a favor in return.

20:22.447 --> 20:25.188
- God is not the Godfather.
- I know.

20:25.275 --> 20:27.911
Don Corleone just had
politicians in his pocket

20:27.948 --> 20:29.364
like so many nickels and dimes.

20:29.439 --> 20:31.956
God's got all of existence
on His payroll.

20:31.993 --> 20:33.918
Well, you have not found God.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.758
And you have not found
your higher power.

20:35.795 --> 20:37.962
And please, for Christ's sake,
watch another movie.

20:38.110 --> 20:41.365
But my yips went away
when I was by myself talking.

20:41.442 --> 20:44.346
Talking over the voices
is not gonna get rid of them.

20:44.428 --> 20:46.290
It's just gonna make them
scream louder to be heard.

20:46.327 --> 20:47.886
You need to work the steps.

20:47.923 --> 20:49.434
You know, this is starting
to feel a lot

20:49.471 --> 20:51.066
like brainwashing to me.

20:51.144 --> 20:53.562
I there's a brain in this
world that needs a wash,

20:53.599 --> 20:54.807
it's yours.

20:54.884 --> 20:56.458
'Cause you're gonna relapse.

20:56.496 --> 20:57.737
And you know that.

20:57.925 --> 21:00.325
Nothing's ever good enough for you,
Shirley. I mean, what do I have to do?

21:00.361 --> 21:02.433
I got my old girlfriend's
new boyfriend a job,

21:02.470 --> 21:03.834
I went to a white person church,

21:03.871 --> 21:06.413
I apologized to a freaking
French Canadian.

21:06.559 --> 21:08.479
I mean, when do I get to stop
worrying about everybody else

21:08.515 --> 21:10.100
and focus on myself again? Huh?

21:10.137 --> 21:11.620
When's it gonna be Jim's turn?

21:11.676 --> 21:14.175
When doing good things
stops feeling like a chore,

21:14.212 --> 21:16.077
then it can be Jim's turn again.

21:16.857 --> 21:19.198
Then I'll just be addicted
to helping people.

21:19.322 --> 21:21.408
And, no, that seems like
a lateral move to me.

21:21.527 --> 21:22.857
At best.

21:25.291 --> 21:27.007
Two outs tying run at the plate.

21:27.044 --> 21:29.372
Williams sets and delivers,
and misses inside

21:29.409 --> 21:31.668
with a slider low, two and...

21:32.414 --> 21:33.801
- Two and...
- Two and one.

21:33.838 --> 21:35.049
What she said.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.407
Clock skies one out to left
for the final out,

21:37.444 --> 21:39.410
and we head to the bottom
of the fifth, folks.

21:40.082 --> 21:41.997
Hey, good job, buddy.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.458
I'm glad we figured out a solution.

21:43.495 --> 21:44.702
Oh, me too.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.544
You know, it turns out all
we had to do is take that

21:46.581 --> 21:48.703
feral dog and chop his balls off.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.508
It's... it's a process.
