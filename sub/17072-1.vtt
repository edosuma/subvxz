02:19.903 --> 02:22.910
The new shipment has arrived, Master.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.660
Good, good, good...

04:12.351 --> 04:15.675
What a marvelous, wonderful,
attentive audience you are.

04:15.775 --> 04:16.702
And I may I add...

04:16.875 --> 04:18.591
... a brave one too.

04:19.392 --> 04:23.475
Now those of you who are weak willed
or coward would have fled by now.

04:23.516 --> 04:25.108
Or regurgitated...

04:25.785 --> 04:27.723
...over the seats in front of you.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.621
But why, really?

04:31.007 --> 04:33.296
This is just a theatrical presentation.

04:33.410 --> 04:34.584
A show,

04:35.434 --> 04:39.522
which offers no reality,
not a fraction of reality.

04:39.926 --> 04:41.933
And just allows us, you and me...

04:42.482 --> 04:45.047
... to tell into our deepest fantasies

04:45.048 --> 04:47.266
far beyond erotica.

04:50.003 --> 04:51.081
I'm...

04:52.008 --> 04:53.676
Sardu

04:54.168 --> 04:57.946
Master of the Theater of the Macabre.

04:58.291 --> 04:59.270
Tonight...

04:59.370 --> 05:01.531
... we begin with torture.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.031
Again I warn you...

05:04.101 --> 05:06.090
If should you find what you see...

05:06.318 --> 05:08.677
is a little upsetting to your stomachs...

05:09.502 --> 05:11.868
then just pretend we're play acting.

05:13.131 --> 05:15.729
But if you're skeptical or bored...

05:16.378 --> 05:18.952
then just pretend that what you see...

05:19.209 --> 05:21.131
is real.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.267
Are you willing to accept Sardu
as your lord and master...

05:36.268 --> 05:38.758
and obey his every whim and command?

05:40.107 --> 05:41.464
Listen...

05:41.517 --> 05:43.183
I'll do anything you want.

05:43.407 --> 05:45.507
Oh no, no, no, my dear!

05:46.266 --> 05:47.871
We've just begun.

05:48.071 --> 05:49.761
It's a trick!

05:50.408 --> 05:51.980
Who said that?

05:55.010 --> 05:58.618
Ohhh Mr. Maverick,
the famous football player.

06:00.314 --> 06:01.762
Ralphus...

06:02.568 --> 06:05.285
Would you care to try it
on Miss DeNatalie there?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.285
The lovely prima ballerina.

06:07.712 --> 06:09.830
Don't you dare!

06:11.014 --> 06:12.146
A trick?

06:15.793 --> 06:20.040
What you are about to see now is
the is the 2nd degree of torture.

06:20.383 --> 06:23.187
The iron tourniquet.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.124
She's dead, master.

07:10.586 --> 07:12.628
She is dead.

07:13.112 --> 07:14.562
Tell me, Mr. Maverick...

07:14.662 --> 07:16.266
Why are you applauding?

07:16.301 --> 07:17.920
She is a very good actress.

07:18.208 --> 07:21.394
What if I were to tell you
that she is really dead?

07:21.467 --> 07:24.038
Actually and eternally?

07:24.073 --> 07:24.982
Trash!

07:26.104 --> 07:28.421
I've seen better, years ago...

07:28.525 --> 07:30.781
in the Grand-Guignol in Paris.

07:31.344 --> 07:35.052
Ahh Mr. Creasy Silo,
the eminent critic.

07:35.864 --> 07:37.511
Not here officially...

07:37.961 --> 07:41.755
I don't review third rate magic shows.

07:41.860 --> 07:42.857
Magic?

07:43.290 --> 07:47.263
And let Mr. Silo
explain our next trick...

07:48.630 --> 07:50.492
Dismemberment.

08:46.331 --> 08:50.242
Ohh now we're getting
the proper reaction.

09:15.392 --> 09:18.022
Now the eyes, Ralphus.

09:42.489 --> 09:44.315
Call this a trick?

09:45.347 --> 09:47.066
Not a trick...

09:48.043 --> 09:49.198
Drama.

09:49.498 --> 09:51.901
Pure theater.

09:55.201 --> 09:59.029
The donation for actors, please.
Non of the actors receive any pay.

10:01.321 --> 10:04.276
The donation for actors, please.
Non of the actors receive any pay.

10:08.081 --> 10:10.066
Thank you very much, sir.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.523
A donation for the actors.

10:12.081 --> 10:13.783
Mr. Silo...

10:14.036 --> 10:15.610
A donation for the actors?

10:15.839 --> 10:16.748
Actors?

10:17.060 --> 10:20.956
No true actor would submit
to engage in such trash.

10:22.891 --> 10:25.017
But you are going
to review my show.

10:25.036 --> 10:26.571
Absolutely not!

10:26.832 --> 10:28.075
You heard me in there ...

10:28.335 --> 10:32.377
If I were to review your
so-called show even badly,

10:33.097 --> 10:37.129
I feel some of my readers
might come just out of curiosity.

10:37.566 --> 10:40.729
And I do not want to be responsible
for keeping your theater open,

10:40.948 --> 10:42.902
one more day!

10:46.379 --> 10:47.829
Then we shall see.

10:49.510 --> 10:50.418
Really ?

10:56.234 --> 10:57.309
Hey, don't listen to him.

10:57.528 --> 10:59.607
I hate critics and he is
at the top of the list.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.820
You know, I really liked your show.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.117
Thank you, Mr. Maverick.

11:04.336 --> 11:06.122
You ought to move it up town.

11:06.342 --> 11:07.333
Ohh well...

11:07.887 --> 11:10.560
And what did Miss DeNatalie
think of our show?

11:10.935 --> 11:14.098
It was just so real.

11:14.652 --> 11:16.061
That girl in the chair...

11:16.364 --> 11:17.523
She was excellent.

11:17.584 --> 11:19.696
She's a fantastic actress.
I'd like to meet her.

11:20.716 --> 11:22.703
Well, perhaps another time.

11:23.590 --> 11:25.626
She got a terrible headache.

11:26.597 --> 11:27.507
Oh, I could imagine!

11:28.020 --> 11:29.125
Good night.

11:29.237 --> 11:30.543
Thank you.

11:30.898 --> 11:31.724
Good night.

11:33.070 --> 11:36.818
Tom, will you please get me
out of here before I throw up.

12:59.428 --> 13:02.367
Don't you dare ruin my dinner!

13:35.001 --> 13:36.490
How delightful...

13:36.709 --> 13:38.739
A little after dinner music.

13:43.707 --> 13:46.404
I want Creasy Silo brought here!

13:49.498 --> 13:52.028
You want us to kidnap him, master?

13:53.741 --> 13:55.173
Yes, Ralphus.

13:55.208 --> 13:58.066
I can't do it, it's too dangerous.

13:58.326 --> 13:59.942
I'll get caught!

14:00.294 --> 14:02.817
You must do this for me, Ralphus.

14:03.368 --> 14:06.234
Then what will you do for me, master?

14:21.862 --> 14:24.600
You've been a very bad boy today.

14:24.862 --> 14:26.934
Have I really been that bad?

14:28.944 --> 14:30.850
Must I be punished?

15:05.708 --> 15:09.495
Now I find this artist makes
a very interesting statement.

15:10.056 --> 15:12.989
I beg your pardon, haven't
I seen you somewhere before?

15:37.174 --> 15:40.347
Welcome to the Theater
of the Macabre, Mr Silo.

15:41.589 --> 15:46.120
I think your appreciation of my art shall
be greatly enhanced in the next few days.

15:50.461 --> 15:51.786
I don't believe it!

15:52.171 --> 15:56.076
I don't believe it, Sardu.

15:57.169 --> 16:02.522
Thinking of all these is so trite
and kidnapping, so classical.

16:05.042 --> 16:08.728
The eminent critic has a
sense of humor in times of stress.

16:09.748 --> 16:12.478
But it won't suffice for
what is to follow, my friend.

16:13.122 --> 16:16.402
Unless of course you agree
that my theater is true art

16:16.621 --> 16:19.611
and you apologise to me
in the most sincere way.

16:20.895 --> 16:22.209
Or...?

16:23.828 --> 16:25.250
Torture.

16:29.243 --> 16:31.024
This will never work, Sardu.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.116
Allow me to show you.

16:39.781 --> 16:44.239
No. No.

17:01.299 --> 17:05.262
A most modern method
of reflex orientation.

17:06.398 --> 17:11.579
Ralphus will now induce
500 volts to her nervous system.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.425
If she does as she
is told, there is no pain,

17:44.525 --> 17:45.367
if not...

17:46.732 --> 17:48.819
excruciating agony.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.640
She will soon learn, the only
thing to alleviate her discomfort ...

17:52.740 --> 17:56.027
is her utterly correct
responses to my commands

17:56.127 --> 17:59.043
and the sound of this whistle.

18:11.997 --> 18:13.528
No. ..

18:34.568 --> 18:35.723
Master!

18:36.284 --> 18:38.607
Please don't hurt me any more!

18:39.117 --> 18:40.608
Master !

18:43.924 --> 18:45.481
I know, my dear.

18:46.449 --> 18:50.136
We will soon find many
exciting things for you to do.

18:51.281 --> 18:54.028
And in time you'll
learn to enjoy them.

18:58.215 --> 18:59.402
Gidee Up!

19:01.529 --> 19:02.717
So Creasy...

19:02.946 --> 19:08.010
look on in awe at a man who has
turned all his fantasies into reality.

19:08.636 --> 19:09.509
Not really.

19:10.070 --> 19:11.885
One still escapes you ...

19:11.903 --> 19:14.175
Success in the theater.

19:15.152 --> 19:16.848
That is about to occur.

19:17.067 --> 19:20.405
My new show
received critical acclaim.

19:20.525 --> 19:23.890
You haven't the talent to
create anything but garbage.

19:24.899 --> 19:27.431
A ballet is forming in my mind.

19:27.983 --> 19:30.545
It will combine 2 art forms...

19:30.773 --> 19:33.388
Sadism and dance.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.963
Cos the public cannot
digest eroticism alone.

19:37.564 --> 19:41.500
But to display sadism and
discipline in its purest form

19:41.629 --> 19:43.717
would on lead to imprisonment.

19:44.545 --> 19:49.177
But by simply disguising
it with a story, a minimal plot

19:49.396 --> 19:50.551
and a score...

19:51.311 --> 19:56.309
will result in my being
hailed as a creative genius.

19:56.344 --> 19:57.174
Kill me!

19:58.560 --> 19:59.724
Kill me!

20:00.058 --> 20:01.530
Oh no, my friend.

20:02.391 --> 20:06.161
You're going to be front
row, centre in my triumph.

20:06.557 --> 20:07.578
After all...

20:08.973 --> 20:11.922
what good is the show
without a critic?

20:19.072 --> 20:21.077
Have you finished your ride, Ralphus?

20:21.396 --> 20:23.168
Put her to work in the toilet.

20:28.512 --> 20:31.378
Her mouth will make
an interesting urinal.

20:39.534 --> 20:44.856
At last I'm glad to see some of the petro
dollars flowing back in this direction.

20:54.072 --> 20:57.470
I can't say I'm not doing
my bit for the economy.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.251
One million.

21:16.243 --> 21:18.613
Whoa, there's no need to count it.

21:18.648 --> 21:21.808
Your employer is an old customer.

21:21.843 --> 21:24.882
He is very pleased with
the quality of the shipment.

21:24.917 --> 21:29.813
They have done much to maintain
peace in my area of the world.

21:30.241 --> 21:34.351
You tell Henry that
he is a very fine gentleman.

21:34.386 --> 21:36.424
And a very good customer.

21:37.105 --> 21:38.911
Will I be seeing him shortly?

21:38.930 --> 21:41.031
No, not likely.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.542
At this moment, he is
flying back to the Middle east.

21:44.577 --> 21:48.918
To be on hand to supervise
the reception of the shipment.

21:49.070 --> 21:50.733
Personally!

21:51.170 --> 21:55.500
If that is agreeable
with everybody concerned.

22:29.022 --> 22:31.856
Go away!
Go away!

22:32.686 --> 22:34.971
Filthy bitches!

22:35.006 --> 22:36.003
Get back!

22:36.952 --> 22:39.598
Get back!
Away, bitches!

22:39.599 --> 22:40.585
Get back!

22:42.693 --> 22:43.840
Stay back!

22:54.153 --> 22:54.791
Stay back!

23:01.359 --> 23:02.356
Sluts!

23:04.812 --> 23:06.351
Are you hurt, master?

23:06.471 --> 23:08.099
It's just a scratch.

23:08.806 --> 23:10.269
Still untrainable!

23:10.892 --> 23:14.087
Still refuse to accept
me as your master, eh?

23:17.504 --> 23:18.510
Ralphus.

23:18.545 --> 23:19.509
Master?

23:20.615 --> 23:22.356
Starve them to bed.

23:25.412 --> 23:26.986
A dinner by candlelight?

23:27.205 --> 23:28.447
How romantic!

23:32.129 --> 23:33.454
How's the fillet?

23:34.591 --> 23:35.713
Tender?

23:36.787 --> 23:40.004
You are eating one of my
trainees that didn't quite work out.

23:42.977 --> 23:45.346
You mean I didn't spoil your appetite?

23:46.358 --> 23:49.392
Nothing you can say
or do will revolt me.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.854
My next show will.

23:55.661 --> 23:57.026
Your shows ...

23:57.246 --> 23:58.321
would revolt...

23:59.750 --> 24:00.992
anyone.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.353
It will be built around ballet.

24:06.717 --> 24:10.462
You haven't the talent
to stage a proper ballet.

24:11.165 --> 24:14.032
It will star Natasha DeNatalie.

24:19.777 --> 24:22.037
She'll never dance for you.

24:22.907 --> 24:24.566
Not willingly.

24:25.994 --> 24:27.265
Yes, master?

24:27.786 --> 24:29.060
Ralphus.

24:29.248 --> 24:33.527
Be a little chap and run along and
collect Natasha DeNatalie for me.

24:40.222 --> 24:41.003
Tom ..

24:41.221 --> 24:43.381
you do everything just so well...

24:43.600 --> 24:45.177
even make love.

24:45.921 --> 24:49.390
Well, no matter what I do, nothing
compares to you on the stage, beautiful.

24:49.984 --> 24:52.283
You make Lincoln Center just come alive.

24:55.699 --> 24:57.601
I have to get to work, though.

25:00.915 --> 25:02.591
Estonian ballerinas...

25:03.368 --> 25:04.474
- Tom.
- Hmm.

25:04.778 --> 25:07.805
Do you find me attractive
as a star of the ballet...

25:07.967 --> 25:09.293
or as a person?

25:09.411 --> 25:10.285
Both.

25:10.304 --> 25:13.006
Oh, come on, I think
you just like dancing.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.208
Not when they look like you, I do.

25:17.245 --> 25:18.419
Natasha

25:23.071 --> 25:25.247
I'll be late for rehearsal.

25:25.782 --> 25:26.804
One cup of coffee?

25:27.034 --> 25:28.025
No.

25:29.412 --> 25:30.987
Will I see you tonight?

25:31.708 --> 25:32.574
Well ..

25:32.834 --> 25:34.451
after the performance.

25:46.394 --> 25:47.416
You know, Tom ..

25:50.189 --> 25:52.224
if I had time...

25:53.738 --> 25:57.514
you would be the only person
I would spend it with in this world.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.535
Welcome.

27:08.754 --> 27:12.490
So, you've decided to leave Lincoln
Center and come to dance with me?

27:36.300 --> 27:37.521
Do you like?

27:37.835 --> 27:40.317
I like very much, master.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.572
Then do what you please with her,

27:42.591 --> 27:44.709
only don't incapacitate her.

27:45.261 --> 27:47.211
She must dance for me.

27:53.961 --> 27:55.520
Ralphus!

27:56.069 --> 27:58.103
No marks on her body!

28:29.180 --> 28:30.270
Who is this?

28:31.657 --> 28:33.191
Natasha? No, she is not here.

28:34.036 --> 28:35.194
She did what?

28:35.413 --> 28:37.197
She didn't come to the theater?

28:40.295 --> 28:41.786
How long has she been missing?

28:45.968 --> 28:47.961
Jesus Christ!

28:50.641 --> 28:52.634
Why didn't you call me earlier?

28:57.735 --> 29:01.487
Natasha DeNatalie has joined my company.

29:05.955 --> 29:08.489
Her absence will not be taken lightly.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.824
The Police will track her here.

29:11.043 --> 29:13.162
They haven't tracked anyone here yet.

29:13.589 --> 29:15.456
I've been in business for years.

29:15.674 --> 29:18.575
DeNatalie is a celebrity.

29:22.269 --> 29:24.995
Public opinion will force them...

29:27.316 --> 29:28.841
to come here.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.092
It's nothing...

29:31.448 --> 29:33.199
have it your missing high schoolgirls...

29:33.200 --> 29:34.972
whose feat is of...

29:35.201 --> 29:38.395
no interest, not even parents.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.947
Now, will you dance for me?

30:22.641 --> 30:23.848
Continue.

30:49.927 --> 30:52.036
She is stronger than we thought.

30:52.473 --> 30:57.194
24 hours without sleep, warmth,
and comfort and she still denies me.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.672
Really, I quite admire her courage.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.727
It's really quite a challenge.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.785
<i> This is the New York Police
Department emergency number 911.</i>

31:24.015 --> 31:27.312
<i> There is no one in at the moment.
You are listening to a recording.</i>

31:27.331 --> 31:30.078
<i>At the sound of the beep,
leave your name, telephone number,</i>

31:30.109 --> 31:34.185
<i>a short description of the crime
and their perpetrators.</i>

31:47.681 --> 31:49.655
Is she dead, master?

31:51.849 --> 31:53.122
Not quite.

31:55.356 --> 31:57.561
If she dies no new show.

31:57.989 --> 31:59.315
I know, idiots.

31:59.744 --> 32:01.822
And all our work will have been in vain.

32:04.422 --> 32:05.831
Call the doctor.

32:47.490 --> 32:49.274
Will she live, doctor?

32:54.298 --> 32:55.572
I've given Ralphus a prescription.

32:57.597 --> 32:59.089
How much do I owe you?

32:59.688 --> 33:02.884
My malpractice insurance is going up.

33:03.781 --> 33:06.484
How about taking it out on trade?

33:07.906 --> 33:09.701
Another operation?

33:10.964 --> 33:12.042
What kind?

33:12.723 --> 33:15.882
Ooh, you make it up.

33:27.322 --> 33:29.057
This won't hurt a bit.

33:29.886 --> 33:31.339
Pretty patient.

33:31.340 --> 33:32.341
No. ..

33:32.770 --> 33:33.793
Now...

33:34.943 --> 33:36.895
I like coming to Sardu's...

33:37.407 --> 33:41.866
'cos he lets me do anything
I want to, to the patients.

33:42.552 --> 33:43.943
Understand ?

33:48.558 --> 33:52.935
Hi, aren't we going to
have a pretty operation.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.487
I don't have many...

33:56.998 --> 33:58.532
pretty patients...

34:00.196 --> 34:02.309
because I get into a lot of trouble...

34:02.328 --> 34:04.130
and my mother doesn't like it.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.555
I live with my mother.

34:08.025 --> 34:11.058
Please.
Please don't hurt me.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.484
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:12.911 --> 34:15.225
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to cure you.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.415
Of everything.

34:20.556 --> 34:23.302
Please. Please
I'll do anything.

34:23.849 --> 34:24.931
You will?

34:29.286 --> 34:32.534
Can you do something with your mouth?

34:33.223 --> 34:35.041
I love mouths.

34:35.663 --> 34:37.337
I should have been a dentist.

34:38.141 --> 34:38.926
But...

34:39.855 --> 34:43.355
My mother said that a
doctor is much classier.

34:45.069 --> 34:46.360
You won't bite?

34:48.436 --> 34:50.540
Okay, open wide.

34:51.753 --> 34:53.504
You sure you won't bite?

34:54.960 --> 34:57.590
Let's make sure you won't bite.

35:10.683 --> 35:12.594
That's it...

35:22.839 --> 35:24.331
Now...

35:24.250 --> 35:26.445
When I was in school...

35:26.466 --> 35:28.635
they used to say that...

35:29.987 --> 35:33.255
I couldn't do that.

35:45.546 --> 35:46.622
Now...

35:46.641 --> 35:48.677
you can't bite.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.175
Doctor?

36:12.000 --> 36:15.212
Well, you're not going
to do her hair, are you?

36:15.798 --> 36:16.823
No.

36:17.820 --> 36:21.394
A little bit of a
elective neurosurgery.

39:41.190 --> 39:44.363
I was just going to see
the doctor out, master?

39:49.880 --> 39:51.203
What did you say?

39:51.973 --> 39:54.860
I was just going to see
the doctor out, master.

39:54.980 --> 39:55.929
Doctor!

39:58.192 --> 39:59.215
Get rid of him!

40:00.071 --> 40:01.148
Yes, master.

40:03.622 --> 40:04.988
Permanently.

40:18.675 --> 40:22.093
Would it be easier to
get a taxi out of Broadway?

40:22.312 --> 40:24.315
No, it's quicker this way.
You'll like it.

40:28.834 --> 40:29.993
Right here!

40:30.213 --> 40:32.580
... my office in a cab.
I'm not trying to wait for the subway!

40:32.599 --> 40:33.949
This is faster.

40:34.570 --> 40:36.384
Come on.
Right this way.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.607
Okay, I ... thank you.
Say goodbye to Sardu.

42:48.178 --> 42:50.188
Bulls eye, coming up.

44:22.229 --> 44:23.013
Who is it?

44:23.232 --> 44:25.732
Sergeant Tucci,
New York City Police Department.

44:27.071 --> 44:28.021
Come on in.

44:29.078 --> 44:30.923
You left a message on
our service, Mr Maverick.

44:30.924 --> 44:32.024
Right, right.

44:32.940 --> 44:34.115
How about a drink?

44:34.335 --> 44:35.952
No, I haven't got the time.

44:36.839 --> 44:38.580
Got another case uptown.

44:38.841 --> 44:41.164
- Listen, have you got any leads for...
- Fine place you got here!

44:42.160 --> 44:43.283
No wonder.

44:44.222 --> 44:46.839
That was some contract you just signed.

44:47.725 --> 44:50.510
I mean, keeping the chips
for the rest of your life.

44:51.869 --> 44:53.438
And those hairspray commercials,

44:54.441 --> 44:57.110
- really something!
- The DeNatalie case...

44:57.527 --> 44:58.896
Do you have any leads?

45:01.684 --> 45:03.275
Only you, QP.

45:03.494 --> 45:04.276
Me?

45:06.162 --> 45:06.987
You!

45:08.833 --> 45:10.158
I don't understand.

45:10.377 --> 45:11.968
Huh, you were sleeping with her.

45:12.655 --> 45:14.139
You could have got into
an argument or something?

45:14.140 --> 45:15.540
Hey, come on.

45:16.299 --> 45:17.750
Don't worry about it.

45:18.645 --> 45:22.004
A little money upfront and I
can prove that the mayor did it.

45:23.011 --> 45:24.484
This rotten town.

45:25.270 --> 45:26.741
What did you expect?

45:27.897 --> 45:30.639
My father worked for 25 years, for what?

45:31.239 --> 45:32.132
<i> Niente</i>

45:33.155 --> 45:35.271
He didn't live to see his pension.

45:35.290 --> 45:37.188
Now, was he was an honest cop, too?

45:37.701 --> 45:39.357
He was a clerk in the
Department of Commerce.

45:39.376 --> 45:41.494
When are you going to find Natasha?

45:41.678 --> 45:43.696
How much is it worth to you?

45:44.291 --> 45:45.240
Worth to me?

45:45.443 --> 45:47.827
Well, you son of a bitch.
She is a citizen, man.

45:47.947 --> 45:48.953
Take it easy...

45:50.099 --> 45:52.082
I know she is a citizen.

45:52.101 --> 45:53.466
So she's a citizen...

45:54.312 --> 45:56.759
Saw her pictures in a file at
the Missing Persons Bureau.

45:56.819 --> 45:58.543
They mail it to 50 police departments.

46:00.163 --> 46:01.947
Nobody is going to
bother looking for her.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.605
She will show up...

46:05.323 --> 46:06.898
dead, if she's lucky.

46:07.826 --> 46:09.486
You want to be smart, QP?

46:10.247 --> 46:12.645
Take some of this money you have...

46:13.002 --> 46:15.201
and grease the hands of justice.

46:15.462 --> 46:17.244
Make that, the wheels of justice.

46:21.551 --> 46:22.625
Alright.

46:23.303 --> 46:24.461
How much?

46:26.682 --> 46:27.786
Ten grand.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.400
Well, how is our little patient today?

46:37.101 --> 46:38.596
I won't dance.

46:39.448 --> 46:40.888
Enough of that!

46:43.150 --> 46:45.434
Time to recoup your energy.

46:46.322 --> 46:49.190
Ralphus has made
some chicken soup for you.

46:52.119 --> 46:55.696
There...
He made it especially for you.

46:59.212 --> 47:00.400
Delicious?

47:02.133 --> 47:03.749
My mother taught me...

47:03.968 --> 47:06.667
I used the whole chicken.

47:07.054 --> 47:09.522
The secret is cooking it alive.

47:19.137 --> 47:21.978
We have a little entertainment
planned for you today...

47:22.905 --> 47:24.648
some thing that may happen to you...

47:24.867 --> 47:27.485
if you still insist on not dancing.

47:29.372 --> 47:30.238
Lights!

47:31.566 --> 47:32.855
The rack.

47:33.876 --> 47:35.703
A legitimate form of punishment,

47:35.922 --> 47:39.373
legalized by both the
Church and the State.

47:42.138 --> 47:43.243
Action!

48:16.719 --> 48:21.130
This is going to go far beyond
every stretch of your imagination.

48:51.426 --> 48:53.125
Slowly, girls!

48:53.244 --> 48:54.418
Slowly!

49:46.540 --> 49:47.923
- QP?
- Yeah.

49:48.158 --> 49:49.149
Sergeant Tucci.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.444
I finally figured out what happened
to your girlfriend Natasha.

49:53.064 --> 49:53.878
What?

49:53.797 --> 49:56.951
The Times critic Creasy Silo,
disappeared last week, right?

49:57.170 --> 49:57.901
Right.

49:58.030 --> 49:59.578
Yeah, they ran off together.

50:00.256 --> 50:01.413
Bullshit!

50:01.433 --> 50:03.291
Extremely plausible.

50:03.361 --> 50:05.793
Tucci, I want my money back.

50:06.221 --> 50:08.672
It's only a theory, QP.

50:08.890 --> 50:09.764
Listen...

50:09.975 --> 50:11.215
I'm working on it.

50:11.434 --> 50:12.969
Yeah, well, you better be.

50:27.496 --> 50:29.978
Our second
demonstration, my dear.

50:30.499 --> 50:34.993
Add punishment for little girl who
refuses to take her dancing lesson.

50:42.680 --> 50:46.175
Due to her tender age,
we're being most gentle with her.

50:47.812 --> 50:49.135
Help me!

51:00.075 --> 51:01.985
Now, as long as
you do as we tell you ...

51:02.204 --> 51:04.153
the longer you'll stay alive.

51:23.311 --> 51:27.472
Open your mouth, I'm going
to put something nice into it.

51:29.151 --> 51:30.685
Good!

51:30.904 --> 51:33.020
Bite down hard.
Don't let go.

51:34.450 --> 51:36.066
You may lose your head.

51:36.618 --> 51:40.502
Now, let's see how long you can
go before you open your mouth.

51:46.412 --> 51:48.245
Why, I almost forgot...

51:51.136 --> 51:55.379
We're going to cane you for
being a very bad little girl.

52:01.773 --> 52:03.431
Help me!

53:35.339 --> 53:39.168
How many times do I have to tell you,
you're white and I'm brown, idiot!

53:40.262 --> 53:42.588
How much we play for, Master?

53:44.099 --> 53:46.735
Well, let's start off
with the finger in the pot.

54:49.284 --> 54:51.501
You don't have any more chips, master.

54:52.178 --> 54:54.338
Why is it you always win?

54:55.641 --> 54:56.550
Play on!

54:56.653 --> 54:59.136
But you don't have
any more chips, master.

55:03.107 --> 55:05.560
I bet you an arm and a leg, I do.

55:13.746 --> 55:15.944
What's this about a hunger strike?

55:18.044 --> 55:20.160
Well, I won't have it.

55:19.979 --> 55:22.995
You're as much a part
of the scene as Natasha.

55:23.218 --> 55:24.312
Ralphus.

55:25.452 --> 55:27.102
Force feed him.

55:59.916 --> 56:02.250
Allow me to introduce to you...

56:02.269 --> 56:03.710
your rival...

56:05.439 --> 56:06.463
Maya.

56:14.133 --> 56:15.663
Natasha!

56:16.912 --> 56:19.562
She will not dance for you either.

56:19.681 --> 56:20.886
Oh, yes, she will ...

56:21.116 --> 56:24.067
but she'll do a dance
of a different kind.

56:24.703 --> 56:27.864
I shall now demonstrate to
you what shall happen to you...

56:28.083 --> 56:31.117
if you do not immediately
agree to start rehearsal.

57:07.804 --> 57:12.440
I think your colleague has
hung up her dancing shoes forever.

57:22.905 --> 57:26.931
Now are you planning to
cut short your dancing career?

57:27.342 --> 57:29.243
I will dance!

57:29.279 --> 57:31.396
Oooh, she will dance.

57:33.809 --> 57:35.650
She will dance.

57:49.444 --> 57:51.133
Theater Macabre.

57:52.732 --> 57:55.831
Nope. Master Sardu
can't come to the phone.

57:57.628 --> 57:59.638
He's tied up for the moment.

58:25.746 --> 58:27.920
She shall dance.

58:31.567 --> 58:33.484
You were wrong, Creasy.

58:34.938 --> 58:36.906
She shall dance for me.

58:39.495 --> 58:41.309
Have some champagne.

58:56.738 --> 58:57.827
That's enough.

59:00.778 --> 59:03.628
"Ballerina Flips Lid For Freak Show"

59:04.564 --> 59:06.924
Your little girlfriend didn't disappear.

59:07.143 --> 59:08.635
She just went off Broadway.

59:08.978 --> 59:11.104
- Right here in Variety.
- Give me that.

59:13.308 --> 59:15.042
Christ, I don't believe it...

59:16.204 --> 59:17.676
You know broads...

59:17.705 --> 59:18.917
Come on.

59:18.918 --> 59:22.102
She wouldn't give up Lincoln Center
for that rat hole in Soho!

59:22.276 --> 59:25.153
Ooh, they kidnapped her
and tortured her.

59:25.690 --> 59:26.639
Wise up!

59:26.858 --> 59:28.806
But she's not
appearing willingly.

59:28.810 --> 59:31.602
Yeah.
Hey!

59:32.431 --> 59:34.964
What kind of show
does this guy Sardu put on?

59:35.976 --> 59:37.133
Ahh, nude ones.

59:39.105 --> 59:41.704
I wonder how much he's paying off ...

59:42.317 --> 59:44.240
I got to talk to her.

01:00:08.622 --> 01:00:10.957
Careful, Ralphus.
Careful.

01:00:11.076 --> 01:00:13.557
We want him to look
his best for opening night.

01:00:14.426 --> 01:00:16.996
No, no.

01:00:17.734 --> 01:00:21.018
You wouldn't dare
allow me appear in public.

01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:22.979
Oh, yes, I would.

01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:28.360
And you're going to have
the best seat in the house.

01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:49.542
Ok girls, take ten.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.431
Well, Ralphus, what
do you think so far?

01:00:54.393 --> 01:00:56.610
Nah! It's too long, master.

01:00:56.629 --> 01:00:57.777
Too long?

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:00.287
Then why didn't you cut
out the last Inquisition joke

01:01:00.288 --> 01:01:02.547
and make your exit on the Gestapo.

01:01:02.582 --> 01:01:03.590
Ralphus!

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.406
- Master?
- Yes.

01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:11.005
- About my billing?
- Don't talk to me about billing!

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.443
I thought you gave that all up when
you left the William Morris Agency!

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.668
Actors...

01:01:21.041 --> 01:01:23.539
Master will be with you in a moment.

01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:26.683
He's on the telephone
with his press agent.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:35.489
It's some witty place.

01:01:39.669 --> 01:01:41.177
You know something, QP?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.865
There is more in here than meets the eye.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.083
Yeah what?

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.337
I smell money.

01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:52.987
I always thought these
Off-Off Broadway gimmicks

01:01:52.988 --> 01:01:54.824
were front for something else.

01:01:55.355 --> 01:01:56.513
So for what?

01:01:57.149 --> 01:01:58.373
I don't know.

01:01:58.567 --> 01:01:59.756
Something big.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:05.276
Mr. Maverick.

01:02:07.452 --> 01:02:10.008
Well, it's certainly
nice seeing you again.

01:02:10.043 --> 01:02:10.447
Either way.

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:11.655
John Tucci.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:15.309
Sergeant John Tucci,
New York City Police Department.

01:02:15.328 --> 01:02:16.376
Really?

01:02:18.174 --> 01:02:20.333
You are both coming
to our opening tonight.

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.461
Listen...

01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:24.275
I'd like to see Natasha.

01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:27.187
Oh I'm afraid not.
She's exhausted.

01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:29.366
Rehearsal after rehearsal.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.020
You know what a perfectionist she is!

01:02:32.021 --> 01:02:34.057
Ya, I know all about that.
I just want to see her, alright.

01:02:34.176 --> 01:02:34.816
Why?

01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:39.362
I mean, we're all going to Sardis
aren't we, afterwards, to celebrate.

01:02:39.448 --> 01:02:41.742
I said I wanted to see her.

01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:44.497
Well, absolutely not.

01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:46.378
This is the theater.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.665
You know what an opening is like?

01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:52.743
In fact I can hardly afford to spend
these few moments talking to you.

01:02:53.798 --> 01:02:56.290
Produce the lady, Sardu.

01:02:56.719 --> 01:02:57.742
Please...

01:02:58.764 --> 01:03:02.004
Produce the lady
or produce your license.

01:03:02.139 --> 01:03:03.178
<i>Capish.</i>

01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:05.927
If she's not here in five minutes...

01:03:06.939 --> 01:03:09.573
there's going to be so many
violations against this place...

01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:13.123
that you won't be able to
open a can of beer tonight.

01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:16.814
If you insist...

01:03:18.578 --> 01:03:19.850
I insist!

01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:22.781
Very well.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.609
But don't take up
too much of her time.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.828
Hey there, you got a nice
way of getting things done.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.677
It's called tact.

01:03:39.711 --> 01:03:40.968
Hi, Tom!

01:03:44.466 --> 01:03:46.732
I'm sorry I didn't called you, Tom.

01:03:46.752 --> 01:03:50.337
But I've just been so
tied up with my new show.

01:03:50.781 --> 01:03:52.230
Were you here willingly?

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:53.723
Of course!

01:03:54.618 --> 01:03:58.154
I mean, Lincoln Center
it is just so boring.

01:03:58.415 --> 01:04:02.408
You know, one night Giselle act or the
other, that would be the only thing that

01:04:02.527 --> 01:04:05.654
I would have to look forward to.

01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:07.582
Believe me...

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.819
Sardu is a genius.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:14.024
This is where it's all at...

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:16.251
right here in Soho.

01:04:16.745 --> 01:04:18.677
Yeah, but this is a S & M show.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.805
It's not S & M.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.176
This is art!

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:24.520
And ..

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.171
please, will you come
to the show tonight.

01:04:28.367 --> 01:04:31.980
And now Ralphus will show
both of you gentlemen out.

01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:33.583
Don't bother, Sardu.

01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:36.291
We'll find our own way out.

01:04:37.145 --> 01:04:37.826
Come on, Tom

01:05:00.738 --> 01:05:04.586
Master...

01:05:05.779 --> 01:05:06.819
Master...

01:05:09.074 --> 01:05:09.926
Master!

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:14.919
Oh, Master, please
don't punish me, Master.

01:05:16.614 --> 01:05:17.658
Master.

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:23.507
Master..

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.335
You did very well, Natasha.

01:05:37.948 --> 01:05:40.352
Thank you, master.

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:46.816
Thank you, master.

01:05:56.495 --> 01:05:58.786
I don't know what the hell
is the matter with her.

01:05:59.214 --> 01:06:00.914
I thought I know her like a book.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.352
Something doesn't smell right in that place.

01:06:03.678 --> 01:06:04.882
Maybe she's right.

01:06:04.911 --> 01:06:07.271
Sex and sadism might be
the new thing, I don't know...

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:10.618
She was trying to tell you
something QP, and you missed it.

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.151
Like what?

01:06:13.213 --> 01:06:16.868
- She never danced Giselle...
- I know, how do you know?

01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:18.793
I am a freak for anything in a tutu.

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.602
- You?
- Uh, uh.

01:06:20.637 --> 01:06:22.792
When I was a kid,
I wanted to become a dancer.

01:06:23.142 --> 01:06:24.759
But I come from an Italian family...

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:26.971
My father wanted me to do
something honorable...

01:06:27.564 --> 01:06:29.055
so I became an honest cop.

01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.317
But I want to get this guy, Sardu.

01:06:33.054 --> 01:06:34.145
My way.

01:06:38.075 --> 01:06:39.717
What are you doing back here?

01:06:39.836 --> 01:06:42.193
I have a show opening
in less than 2 hours.

01:06:42.228 --> 01:06:43.613
Business, Sardu.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.176
Business?

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:48.968
Monkey business.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.193
I don't understand.

01:06:51.226 --> 01:06:52.416
Understand this!

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:56.978
Ralphus...

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.039
Shut up!

01:06:58.891 --> 01:07:02.177
You kill a cop in this town and
you're as good as dead, Sardu.

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:03.827
<i>Capish</i>

01:07:04.648 --> 01:07:07.048
And you have a record
a mile long, downtown.

01:07:08.655 --> 01:07:10.561
Three open murder charges.

01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:12.189
Now ...

01:07:12.866 --> 01:07:14.766
where's this place, the front door?

01:07:16.939 --> 01:07:18.863
I'll cut you in.

01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:21.065
Of course you'll cut me in.

01:07:21.276 --> 01:07:23.035
But what's going on here, Sardu?

01:07:24.087 --> 01:07:25.512
White slavery.

01:07:26.731 --> 01:07:27.973
White slavery!

01:07:28.885 --> 01:07:30.686
You were keeping years ago.

01:07:31.723 --> 01:07:33.903
My show must open tonight.

01:07:33.938 --> 01:07:36.717
How much you willing to pay
for your show to open tonight?

01:07:39.606 --> 01:07:41.473
I'll give you $50,000.

01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:44.350
$50,000?

01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:49.348
You making that money off these broads?

01:07:50.744 --> 01:07:53.788
I do volume business.
I ship all over the world.

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:55.799
International, huh?

01:07:56.668 --> 01:07:59.201
Well, I guess then we'll
have to up the ante, Sardu.

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:01.987
A 100, 000.

01:08:03.176 --> 01:08:05.794
Alright, I accept
your proposition, Tucci.

01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:06.959
Good.

01:08:07.597 --> 01:08:08.504
Tonight.

01:08:10.266 --> 01:08:11.991
I can't get my hands on that much...

01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:14.577
Well, you better get your
hands on that much cash.

01:08:15.146 --> 01:08:17.096
Now you don't keep
any money in the banks.

01:08:17.216 --> 01:08:20.228
Because the IRS will be down
here with their hands out.

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:23.647
And don't give me any garbage
about safety deposit boxes.

01:08:25.117 --> 01:08:25.941
Tonight.

01:08:27.953 --> 01:08:28.977
Tonight.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:30.997
Good

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.450
Up front...

01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:36.660
before the curtains go up, Sardu.

01:08:43.774 --> 01:08:45.482
Well, what did you find out?

01:08:45.934 --> 01:08:47.633
I hate to disappoint you, kid.

01:08:51.064 --> 01:08:52.270
He's on the up and up.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:54.490
Sardu's on the up and up.
A little weird...

01:08:54.518 --> 01:08:55.734
but on the up and up.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.176
Giselle?
What about Giselle?

01:08:57.296 --> 01:08:59.314
She did it 3 years ago, in St. Louis.

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:01.850
and she's got 8 performances next year.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.569
You know my problem is?

01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:05.988
I've been at this job too long.

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:07.937
I don't trust anyone.

01:09:08.236 --> 01:09:09.930
So it means, you're
going to drop the case?

01:09:09.932 --> 01:09:11.027
What else can I do?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:14.837
She wants to be in a freak
show.  It's a free country.

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:19.586
Hey, maybe some weirdo goes down there,
gets turned on to ballet, who knows ...

01:09:21.265 --> 01:09:23.301
Hey, cheer up.
Why don't you and I go?

01:09:23.337 --> 01:09:24.638
You don't still want to go down there?

01:09:24.673 --> 01:09:27.555
Why not?
It it's ballet, I'm on my way!

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.216
Well, who might have say,
what is art and what isn't?

01:09:32.028 --> 01:09:32.852
Let's go.

01:09:40.787 --> 01:09:42.645
Break a leg, Ralphus.

01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:45.751
Whose, master?

01:09:46.711 --> 01:09:49.497
Ralphus, that was just
a theatrical expression.

01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:52.631
Hey, Ziegfeld!

01:09:53.203 --> 01:09:54.461
You forget about me?

01:09:59.603 --> 01:10:00.528
Wait here.

01:10:00.688 --> 01:10:02.987
I'll take a look,
see what I can do.

01:10:03.206 --> 01:10:04.656
I think I'll take a look, too.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.641
I said, wait here.

01:10:35.754 --> 01:10:40.217
I promise you, you will have a
banquet before this night is through.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.218
Stay back!
Stay back!

01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:59.179
Back!

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:45.947
Excuse me.

01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:49.969
Listen...

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:52.323
Sardu is holding Natasha prisoner.

01:11:52.801 --> 01:11:53.658
What?

01:11:53.844 --> 01:11:56.342
He's got a white slavery
action, 2 -300 girls a year.

01:11:56.571 --> 01:11:57.761
Tortures them.

01:11:58.823 --> 01:12:00.096
White slavery?

01:12:00.743 --> 01:12:03.643
It's all over town, you close 'em up
on east side, they move to the west side.

01:12:03.672 --> 01:12:06.682
You close them up on Park Avenue, what
do you think, they move down to Soho.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.244
White slavery in this day and age?

01:12:10.964 --> 01:12:13.562
You haul them into court and
the judges let them go, you know why?

01:12:13.617 --> 01:12:15.683
Because they are in on the take,
like everybody else is.

01:12:16.804 --> 01:12:17.962
I don't believe it!

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:20.795
Where do you think
half the girls wind up

01:12:20.796 --> 01:12:22.628
will come into this town
belong to show business?

01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:24.448
Off, off Broadway?

01:12:25.563 --> 01:12:27.555
But this time, Sardu's gone too far.

01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:29.025
And I'm going to fix him.

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.865
That freak wants to be a celebrity.

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:33.319
Hey, hey, hey, calm down!

01:12:33.448 --> 01:12:35.973
Many innocent people here,
you want anybody get hurt?

01:12:37.078 --> 01:12:38.652
Take it easy.

01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.113
Watch the show, huh.

01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:46.663
5 minutes to deck...

01:12:46.755 --> 01:12:47.662
5 minutes...

01:12:53.514 --> 01:12:56.650
You look positively magnificent, my dear.

01:12:56.685 --> 01:12:58.308
Thank you, master.

01:12:58.768 --> 01:13:02.850
The Schubert's already inquiring
about moving our show up to Broadway ...

01:13:02.858 --> 01:13:03.599
and then...

01:13:04.484 --> 01:13:05.925
Hollywood!

01:13:19.168 --> 01:13:21.258
And the chief inquisitor said:

01:13:21.377 --> 01:13:24.873
"You must be a secret Jew,
your tongue smoked!"

01:13:35.006 --> 01:13:37.615
I thought I told you to
stop at the Gestapo joke.

01:13:37.856 --> 01:13:39.978
Listen to them,
listen to them...

01:13:40.013 --> 01:13:41.530
They love me,
they love me...

01:13:47.743 --> 01:13:49.234
Actors.

01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:01.762
And now...

01:14:01.863 --> 01:14:05.023
our prima ballerina,
Natasha DeNatalie...

01:14:05.224 --> 01:14:07.690
in a composition of my own...

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.911
"The artist, seduction and death...

01:14:11.912 --> 01:14:13.653
of a critic".

01:16:45.186 --> 01:16:46.583
Is that Creasy Silo?

01:16:46.619 --> 01:16:47.683
Quiet!

01:18:15.097 --> 01:18:16.170
Only the two of us?

01:18:21.728 --> 01:18:23.678
What about the rest of the police force?

01:18:23.697 --> 01:18:25.181
They will make too much noise.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.852
Anyway we want to keep it out
of the papers, don't we?

01:18:27.853 --> 01:18:28.912
Tucci.

01:18:31.633 --> 01:18:34.622
If I make it official, we gonna
have to cut it up too many ways.

01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:36.590
Cut what?

01:18:37.247 --> 01:18:38.939
Sardu's treasure.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:41.749
He's got a fortune
stashed away down there.

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:42.825
I mean, look!

01:18:43.212 --> 01:18:44.827
Silver certificates.

01:18:45.047 --> 01:18:47.288
He hasn't spend a nickel in years.

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:48.733
Hey, don't you have
any sense of justice?

01:18:49.051 --> 01:18:51.733
And what about the people
down in that dungeon right now?

01:18:52.222 --> 01:18:53.954
We'll take care of it.

01:18:53.989 --> 01:18:54.998
Later.

01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:05.489
Oh Christ. People ought to be
more careful of what they leave ....

01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:11.237
What the matter, kid?
Never got a little head before?

01:20:11.315 --> 01:20:12.338
Come on.

01:20:41.476 --> 01:20:43.459
You're hereby placed under arrest!

01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:44.988
You have the right to counsel,

01:20:44.989 --> 01:20:48.241
not required to make any statement
without the presence of counsel.

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:51.842
It is your right to remain silent and
anything you say maybe held against you.

01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:53.233
Understand?

01:20:53.672 --> 01:20:54.513
Good!

01:21:00.305 --> 01:21:01.339
Natasha!

01:21:26.819 --> 01:21:27.819
Ralphus

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.786
Master wants you.

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.750
Come here, you little pervert!

01:22:05.056 --> 01:22:07.158
I may have to get some of these keys.

01:22:07.193 --> 01:22:08.515
Keep your eyes on these...

01:22:09.034 --> 01:22:10.158
weirdos.

01:22:20.883 --> 01:22:22.958
Okay, Sardu, freeze!

01:22:24.986 --> 01:22:26.458
And your boyfriend...

01:22:26.493 --> 01:22:27.221
too.

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.690
- Hey, who's in there?

01:22:45.245 --> 01:22:47.545
He is making love to Creasy Silo.

01:22:47.664 --> 01:22:48.729
What?

01:22:49.958 --> 01:22:51.424
Creasy?

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:56.711
I killed Creasy during the "pas de deux".

01:23:03.807 --> 01:23:05.873
There is no .... I can take.

01:23:07.769 --> 01:23:09.173
Tucci...

01:23:09.722 --> 01:23:11.115
Do me a favor?

01:23:11.817 --> 01:23:13.408
Hit me again!

01:23:13.635 --> 01:23:15.887
If he opens his mouth again, kill him!

01:23:17.573 --> 01:23:18.631
Please?

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:41.499
Jesus Christ!

01:23:47.349 --> 01:23:50.239
Alright, ladies,
Shall we all spring you later?

01:23:54.449 --> 01:23:55.498
Shit!

01:24:00.241 --> 01:24:01.407
Cut it!

01:24:01.626 --> 01:24:04.550
There's plenty of time
to play with that later.

01:24:05.194 --> 01:24:06.789
You know how to get in though?

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.861
Okay, ladies,
We got to get a job to do.

01:24:44.783 --> 01:24:46.736
Come on.
We gotta help him.

01:24:51.975 --> 01:24:53.333
Let's get out of here!

01:24:55.228 --> 01:24:56.761
My master!

01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:59.322
You hurt my master.

01:24:59.899 --> 01:25:00.848
Come on!

01:25:52.821 --> 01:25:53.637
Come on!

01:25:54.381 --> 01:25:55.456
Come on!

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:57.824
What's the matter with you?
Come on!

01:25:58.042 --> 01:25:59.993
I must get back to my master.

01:26:03.099 --> 01:26:05.043
Come on! Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

01:26:06.285 --> 01:26:07.393
God damn it!

01:26:24.268 --> 01:26:25.134
Tom!

01:26:46.604 --> 01:26:48.707
I'm coming, master!
