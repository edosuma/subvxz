WEBVTT

01:22.876 --> 01:24.544
LAURA, YOU'RE USUALLY
THE FIRST ONE GONE

01:24.711 --> 01:27.547
WHEN CLASS IS DISMISSED.
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT?

01:27.714 --> 01:31.050
UH, NO, MA'AM. I WAS
JUST STRAIGHTENING UP
MY DESK.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.343
OH, GOOD.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.108
HENRY, HAVE YOU
SEEN MARY?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.944
RIGHT OUT THERE.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.946
OH. OH, YEAH.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.200
BET YOU CLEAN THOSE ERASERS
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.953
NOTHING TO IT
ONCE YOU GET THE HANG.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.913
KIND OF LIKE DANCING,
I GUESS.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.164
I GUESS.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.707
SEE YOU.

02:44.874 --> 02:45.917
HENRY.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.377
Mary: LAURA'.

02:49.379 --> 02:50.338
LAURA, COME ON.

02:50.505 --> 02:52.674
MA IS WAITING FOR US
AT THE POST OFFICE.

03:06.271 --> 03:07.939
Mary and Laura:
HI, MR. EDWARDS.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.524
Edwards: HI, KIDS'.

03:11.693 --> 03:12.819
Grace: THANK YOU.

03:15.655 --> 03:16.906
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. SNIDER.

03:17.073 --> 03:18.533
- MA, GUESS WHAT.
- WHAT?

03:18.700 --> 03:20.368
BERT MILLER ASKED ME
TO THE SPRING DANCE
WITH HIM,

03:20.535 --> 03:23.204
AND HE'S THE ONLY
BOY I REALLY WANTED
TO GO WITH.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.497
THAT'S NICE, MARY.

03:24.664 --> 03:26.332
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAD A GOOD DAY, MARY.

03:26.499 --> 03:27.834
OH, I DID.
COME ON, CARRIE.

03:28.001 --> 03:29.377
LET'S BEAT
THEM HOME.

03:29.544 --> 03:30.837
Laura: HELLO, MA.

03:31.004 --> 03:33.548
OH, IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE YOU HAD
SUCH A GOOD DAY.

03:33.715 --> 03:35.258
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LAURA?

03:35.425 --> 03:37.927
WELL, I'VE
BEEN THINKING...

03:38.094 --> 03:40.138
WELL, YOU
CAN HEAR FAIRY TALES

03:40.305 --> 03:42.140
AND STORIES,
AND YOU NEVER

03:42.307 --> 03:43.850
REALLY KNOW HOW
TRAGICAL THINGS ARE

03:44.017 --> 03:46.019
UNLESS YOU REALLY
FEEL THEM YOURSELF.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.520
NOW I KNOW HOW
CINDERELLA FELT

03:47.687 --> 03:49.606
WHEN NOBODY ASKED
HER TO THE BALL.

03:49.772 --> 03:53.192
OH. NOW, IT CAN'T
BE THAT BAD.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.862
WELL,
THE ONLY 2 WALLFLOWERS
AT THE SPRING DANCE

03:56.029 --> 03:57.780
ARE GOING TO BE OLD
NELLIE OLESON AND ME.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.408
OH, YOU CAN ADD
THE WIDOW SNIDER
TO THAT LIST.

04:00.575 --> 04:01.868
WHAT?

04:02.035 --> 04:04.621
WELL, MR. EDWARDS
HASN'T SAID A WORD
ABOUT TAKING ME.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.790
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT A PROCRASTINATOR
MR. EDWARDS IS.

04:07.957 --> 04:11.753
INDEED I DO. LAST YEAR
HE NEVER DID
GET AROUND TO ASKING ME.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.422
BUT MR. EDWARDS
LOVES DANCING.

04:14.589 --> 04:15.882
HE LOVES DANCING, HONEY,

04:16.049 --> 04:18.217
BUT HE DOESN'T LOVE
DRESS-UP DANCES.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.470
HE WENT FISHING INSTEAD.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.764
WELL, THERE'S STILL
A WEEK LEFT.

04:22.931 --> 04:24.265
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.142
THAT
DOESN'T HELP ME.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.393
THERE'S ONLY
WILLIE OLESON

04:27.560 --> 04:29.729
AND HENRY HENDERSON
LEFT.

04:29.896 --> 04:31.522
I'M SURPRISED WILLIE
HASN'T ASKED ANYBODY.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.233
HE ASKED EVERYBODY,
AND THEY ALL SAID NO.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.568
AND HENRY HENDERSON

04:35.735 --> 04:37.862
DOESN'T EVEN TALK
TO GIRLS.

04:43.368 --> 04:46.412
GRACE, I MAY
BE SPEAKING OUT OF TURN,

04:46.579 --> 04:47.914
BUT THAT MAN TAKES YOU

04:48.081 --> 04:50.249
ENTIRELY TOO MUCH
FOR GRANTED.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.752
IT'S HIGH TIME HE WAS SHAKEN
OUT OF HIS COMPLACENCY.

04:52.919 --> 04:54.337
I'M AFRAID IT WOULD
TAKE A BOLT

04:54.504 --> 04:56.881
FROM
THE BLUE TO DO THAT.

04:57.048 --> 05:00.551
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS ONE
SURE CURE FOR COMPLACENCY,

05:00.718 --> 05:02.220
AND THAT'S COMPETITION.

05:02.387 --> 05:04.097
WE ONLY COMPETE
AT FISHING.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.266
OH, NO. NOT THAT KIND
OF COMPETITION.

05:07.433 --> 05:11.646
COMPETITION FOR YOU--
A SUITOR.

05:11.813 --> 05:14.440
OH, CAROLINE,
ISAIAH'S THE ONLY
SUITOR I'VE HAD

05:14.607 --> 05:16.109
SINCE MY HUSBAND
PASSED ON.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.653
WHERE IN THE WORLD
AM I GOING TO FIND
ANOTHER ONE?

05:18.820 --> 05:21.990
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU FIND ANOTHER ONE.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.784
IT ONLY MATTERS
IF MR. EDWARDS
THINKS YOU HAVE.

05:24.951 --> 05:26.786
REMEMBER HOW
HE SPARKED YOUR INTEREST

05:26.953 --> 05:28.788
WITH THAT SCENTED LETTER
THAT HE SENT HIMSELF?

05:28.955 --> 05:31.666
WELL, TURNABOUT
IS FAIR PLAY.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.710
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT MIGHT WORK?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.003
I KNOW IT WOULD.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.046
WHY, IF I'D WAITED
FOR CHARLES

05:37.213 --> 05:38.631
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE,

05:38.798 --> 05:41.217
I MIGHT BE
A SPINSTER TODAY.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.469
I FINALLY TOOK
A DRASTIC STEP--

05:43.636 --> 05:45.096
STARTED MAKING
SHEEP'S EYES

05:45.263 --> 05:46.639
AT ANOTHER BOY.

05:46.806 --> 05:50.643
WELL, IF HE DOESN'T
MAKE A MOVE SOON,

05:50.810 --> 05:52.812
IT SURE CAN'T
DO ANY HARM TO TRY.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.148
Caroline: YOU KNOW,
DESPERATE SITUATIONS

05:55.314 --> 05:57.442
CALL FOR DESPERATE
MEASURES.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.818
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, CAROLINE.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.028
BYE.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.654
BYE.

06:05.116 --> 06:06.367
LAURA.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.286
DREAMING?

06:08.453 --> 06:09.829
[LAUGHS]

06:41.569 --> 06:45.615
MARY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

06:45.782 --> 06:47.241
SURE.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.244
HOW DID YOU GET BERT
TO ASK YOU TO THE DANCE?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.997
I JUST STOOD STILL
WHILE HE WAS ASKING ME.

06:53.164 --> 06:57.376
WELL, DIDN'T YOU MAKE
SHEEP'S EYES AT HIM FIRST?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.003
HA HA'.
OF COURSE NOT.

06:59.170 --> 07:02.340
WELL, YOU MUST
HAVE DONE SOMETHING.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.842
I JUST TALKED TO HIM
IS ALL.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.344
WHAT ABOUT?

07:06.511 --> 07:09.388
HISTORY, MOSTLY.
BERT'S REAL GOOD
IN HISTORY.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.724
HE LIKES TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.

07:11.891 --> 07:15.686
HENRY HATES HISTORY,
JUST LIKE ME.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.606
MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH WE HATE IT.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.567
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING HE LIKES,

07:21.734 --> 07:23.486
SOMETHING
HE'S GOOD AT.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.029
YEAH?

07:25.196 --> 07:27.740
SURE. ALL BOYS LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT
THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT.

07:30.535 --> 07:32.912
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TRY THAT.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.414
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.291
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

07:43.214 --> 07:45.883
SURE HOPE THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT HENRY'S GOOD AT.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.180
NEVER SAW YOU MISS AN EASY
SHOT LIKE THAT BEFORE.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.557
IT'S YOUR TURN, HENRY.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.517
I'LL TRADE YOU THESE FOR
THAT BIG AGGIE OF YOURS.

07:54.684 --> 07:56.435
SHH'. DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK

07:56.602 --> 07:58.938
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE
IS TRYING TO PLAY?

07:59.105 --> 08:00.940
OH, MY'. WISH I COULD
SHOOT LIKE THAT.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.400
YOU THINK
YOU COULD SHOW ME HOW?

08:02.567 --> 08:03.818
I'M NOT
PLAYING ANYMORE.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.570
YOU SHOOT
ALL RIGHT NOW.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.280
THING I LIKE
TO DO BEST IS FISHING.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.781
YOU LIKE TO GO FISHING?

08:08.948 --> 08:10.533
YEP.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.369
PA SAYS MOST GIRLS
DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.454
THEY GET ALL FIDGETY,
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S TIME

08:15.621 --> 08:17.957
TO BAIT THE HOOK
WITH A SQUIGGLY WORM.

08:18.124 --> 08:20.543
I CAUGHT MY BIGGEST FISH
USING A BRIGHT-COLORED

08:20.710 --> 08:23.045
PIECE OF YARN ON THE HOOK
AS WELL AS A GRUB.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.505
YOU EVER TRY THAT?

08:24.672 --> 08:25.590
NOPE.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.967
BEST TIME TO CATCH
A FISH IS THE DAY

08:28.134 --> 08:30.553
AFTER A FULL MOON--
THIS SATURDAY,

08:30.720 --> 08:32.180
AND IF THE DAY AFTER
IS CLOUDY,

08:32.346 --> 08:34.307
THEY'LL
BITE GOOD ON ANYTHING.

08:34.473 --> 08:35.683
I BET YOU'RE
THE BEST MARBLE PLAYER

08:35.850 --> 08:37.476
- IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL.
- MAYBE.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.978
YOU'RE A FAST RUNNER, TOO.

08:39.145 --> 08:40.980
I BET YOU'RE
THE FASTEST RUNNER.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.356
I'M NOT SO SURE.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.651
- I'M A PRETTY GOOD
RUNNER FOR A GIRL.
- YEAH.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.653
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GET TIRED
OUT WHEN I'M DANCING.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.071
I BET YOU DON'T EITHER.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.781
I DON'T DANCE.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.659
I'M TEACHING MY BABY
SISTER HOW TO DANCE.

08:53.826 --> 08:56.204
BET I COULD TEACH
ANY PERSON

08:56.370 --> 08:57.580
IF THE PERSON
WANTED TO LEARN.

08:57.747 --> 09:00.791
I SUPPOSE. I GOT CHORES
TO DO. SEE YOU.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.213
Laura:
I DID WHAT YOU SAID

09:05.379 --> 09:08.507
AND I TALKED
TO HENRY ABOUT
WHAT HE WAS GOOD AT.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.426
I EVEN LOST ALL MY
MARBLES ON PURPOSE,

09:10.593 --> 09:12.595
JUST SO HE'D
BE BETTER THAN ME.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.263
WELL, DIDN'T HE
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.765
NO. HENRY
DOESN'T TALK MUCH.

09:15.932 --> 09:19.352
I JUST STOOD STILL
AND WAITED FOR HIM
TO ASK ME.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.020
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

09:21.187 --> 09:23.022
THAT'S WHEN
HE TALKED TO ME.

09:23.189 --> 09:26.859
HE SAID,
"I GOT TO GO NOW."

09:27.026 --> 09:28.778
WELL, MAYBE
HE'LL ASK YOU TOMORROW.

09:28.945 --> 09:30.238
MAYBE.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.578
GOOD MORNING, OLESON.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.205
YEAH. GOOD MORNING, EDWARDS.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

09:39.372 --> 09:40.915
I'M ABOUT TO RUN OUT
OF CHEWING TOBACCO.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.709
WELL, WE'LL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.211
OH, GOOD MORNING,
LADIES.

09:45.378 --> 09:46.462
OH, GOOD MORNING.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.214
HEY. I MISSED YOU AT
THE POKER GAME LAST NIGHT.

09:48.381 --> 09:50.049
Harriet: SOME PEOPLE
SPEND THEIR TIME

09:50.216 --> 09:52.051
IN MORE
WORTHWHILE PURSUITS.

09:52.218 --> 09:53.970
SO WOULD I
IF I COULD THINK OF ONE.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.016
Harriet: HERE, NOW,
THIS MATERIAL--

09:59.183 --> 10:02.687
WHEN THIS FIRST CAME IN,
I SAID TO MR. OLESON,

10:02.853 --> 10:05.231
"THIS IS JUST PERFECT
FOR GRACE SNIDER."

10:05.398 --> 10:07.275
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
GRAY IS SUCH A DRAB COLOR.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.484
WELL, IT'S
SO PRACTICAL.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.403
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
SPRIGHTLIER,

10:10.569 --> 10:12.738
YOU KNOW,
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS...

10:12.905 --> 10:15.658
LIKE, UH, THE SPRING DANCE.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.787
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MR. EDWARDS?

10:19.954 --> 10:22.498
WELL, IF I
WAS GOING TO TRIP
THE LIGHT FANTASTIC,

10:22.665 --> 10:24.208
I THINK
I'D FANCY THE BLUE.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.793
PUTS ME IN MIND
OF CATTAIL LAKE

10:25.960 --> 10:27.586
JUST BEFORE SUNUP.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.171
THEN YOU LIKE THE BLUE?

10:29.338 --> 10:31.257
MM-HMM.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.009
I'LL TAKE
SOME OF THIS.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.468
HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOU OUGHT TO TRY

10:34.635 --> 10:36.053
THE FISHING UP THERE.
IT'S REAL GOOD.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.763
AIN'T GOOD FOR A MAN
TO BE COOPED UP INSIDE

10:37.930 --> 10:38.931
ALL THE TIME.

10:39.098 --> 10:40.266
OH, FOR
HEAVEN'S SAKES.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.851
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO

10:42.018 --> 10:43.602
THAN TO WASTE
YOUR TIME
GOING FISHING

10:43.769 --> 10:44.937
AND ALL THAT
NONSENSE?

10:45.104 --> 10:48.274
SURE I DO--PLAYING
POKER. HA HA'.

10:48.441 --> 10:49.608
SAY, YOU MISSED
A FUNNY STORY

10:49.775 --> 10:50.943
LAST NIGHT
AT THE CARD GAME.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.611
HANSON WAS TELLING
THIS STORY, SEE,

10:52.778 --> 10:55.406
ABOUT A COUPLE
THAT WAS CELEBRATING
25 YEARS OF WEDLOCK.

10:55.573 --> 10:58.617
SEE, THE WIFE,
SHE'S CHATTERING ON
ABOUT THE COURTSHIP

10:58.784 --> 11:00.745
AND THE WEDDING
WAY BACK THEN.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.538
FINALLY, SHE TURNS
TO HIM, AND SHE

11:02.705 --> 11:05.166
SAYS, "HORACE, DO
YOU LOVE ME STILL?"

11:05.333 --> 11:07.752
HE SAID, "MY DEAR,
THAT'S THE WAY
I LOVE YOU BEST."

11:07.918 --> 11:09.462
HA HA'. HA HA...

11:10.963 --> 11:12.465
[WHISPERS]
DISGUSTING MAN.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.134
UM, I WANT A DRESS LENGTH
AND A HALF OF THIS.

11:15.301 --> 11:18.971
I WANT THE SKIRT
REAL FULL FOR DANCING.

11:19.138 --> 11:21.974
Edwards: DANCING? OH, HEY,
SAY, LISTEN, THERE.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.809
UM, SOMETHING I BEEN
MEANING TO ASK YOU.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.686
- OH?
- YEAH. WELL...

11:25.853 --> 11:27.563
I KNOW I'M KIND OF LATE
TO GETTING AROUND TO IT.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.273
OH, WELL, BETTER
LATE THAN NEVER.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.983
WELL, I SHOULD HAVE ASKED
YOU BEFORE THE QUILTING BEE.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.027
THINGS MIGHT NOT
BE THE SAME NOW.

11:33.194 --> 11:35.279
WHAT'S THE QUILTING BEE
GOT TO DO WITH DANCING?

11:35.446 --> 11:36.989
OH, IT'S SPRING, BREEZES,

11:37.156 --> 11:39.158
KITES JUST DANCING
IN THE AIR.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.576
YOU SEE,
I NEED SOME REMNANTS

11:40.743 --> 11:42.161
FOR A TAIL FOR THE ONE
I'M MAKING FOR HALF-PINT.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.789
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME LEFT.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.375
I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND YOU SOME.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.377
WELL, I SURELY
WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.003
WELL, GOT MY TOBACCO.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.422
BEST BE GETTING ON
BACK TO WORK.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.383
YOU PUT THIS ON MY BILL.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.009
Harriet: THAT
WILL BE THE BLUE?

11:57.176 --> 11:59.929
Grace: NO. ANYTHING
BUT THE BLUE.

12:00.096 --> 12:01.597
OH.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.494
Laura, voice-over: I KEPT
THINKING ABOUT WHAT MA HAD SAID,

12:23.661 --> 12:27.748
HOW SHE MADE SHEEP'S EYES
AT SOME BOY TO MAKE PA JEALOUS.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.545
BUT WHO WAS THERE TO MAKE
HENRY HENDERSON JEALOUS WITH?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.267
LIKE MA SAID,

12:46.434 --> 12:49.603
DESPERATE SITUATIONS
CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.989
OH, SAY, MISS GRACE.

13:00.156 --> 13:01.407
YES.

13:01.574 --> 13:04.243
YOU WON'T FORGET MY
REMNANTS, WILL YOU?

13:04.410 --> 13:06.620
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T FORGET.

13:12.334 --> 13:17.089
BLAST THAT MAN'. IF THERE
WAS JUST SOMEBODY ELSE...

13:17.256 --> 13:18.966
ANYBODY ELSE.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.970
OH.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.763
GOOD DAY, GRACE.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.600
DID THAT PACKAGE OF MEDICINE
I ORDERED COME IN YET?

13:30.478 --> 13:33.606
Grace: WHY, YES. YES.
JUST THIS MORNING.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.066
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO GET IT FOR YOU.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.069
OH.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.698
OHH.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.450
GRACE, ARE YOU
FEELING POORLY?

13:44.617 --> 13:46.285
I JUST GOT THIS
STRANGE, GIDDY FEELING.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.745
JUST CAME OVER ME
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

13:47.912 --> 13:48.787
HERE. HERE.
SIT DOWN.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.456
OH, MY GOODNESS.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.003
ARE YOU IN PAIN?

13:56.170 --> 13:58.714
NO. NO PAIN.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.341
GRACE, TELL ME,
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN

14:00.508 --> 14:02.885
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN ME
PROFESSIONALLY,
OR ANY OTHER DOCTOR?

14:03.052 --> 14:04.887
OH, DEAR, I DON'T
RIGHTLY REMEMBER.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.305
TWO YEARS, MAYBE.
MAYBE MORE.

14:06.472 --> 14:07.681
WELL, THAT'S
TOO BLAME LONG.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.141
NOW, YOU'RE COMING
OVER TO MY OFFICE,

14:09.308 --> 14:10.809
AND WE'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.770
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

14:12.937 --> 14:16.273
THEY NEVER SEE A DOCTOR
UNTIL THEY'RE SICK,
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

14:40.673 --> 14:42.550
THERE, THERE, GRACE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

14:42.716 --> 14:44.718
ALL RIGHT. NOW,
JUST LEAN ON ME.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.031
Nellie: HOW ABOUT
THIS ONE--

15:06.198 --> 15:07.825
IF YOUR UNCLE'S
SISTER IS NOT
YOUR AUNT,

15:07.992 --> 15:09.535
WHAT RELATION
IS SHE TO YOU?

15:09.702 --> 15:12.204
Henry: RECKON IF I HAD
AN UNCLE, SHE'D BE MY MA.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.373
OH, HENRY,
YOU'RE SO SMART.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.917
HERE. YOU BETTER
TAKE YOUR MARBLES BACK.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.502
BUT THEY'RE YOURS.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.588
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU BACK
THE ONES I WON FROM YOU.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.007
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU MY BIG AGGIE.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.633
MY PA'S GOT MARBLES
IN THE STORE.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.343
I CAN GET ALL
I WANT.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.720
NOT LIKE MY AGGIE.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.763
MINE'S THE BEST AGGIE
IN ALL OF MINNESOTA.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.100
BET YOU WANT ME
TO DO SOMETHING
MEAN TO MY SISTER.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.977
NO. JUST A FAVOR.

15:35.144 --> 15:36.687
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

15:36.854 --> 15:40.065
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND
LIKE YOU LIKE ME,
LIKE YOU'RE MY BEAU.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.276
THAT'S NO FAVOR.
THAT'S A CHORE.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.404
I DON'T LIKE IT
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,
WILLIE OLESON.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.324
THEN HOW COME YOU
WANT ME TO DO IT?

15:48.490 --> 15:52.786
NEVER MIND WHY. YOU WANT
THE AGGIE OR DON'T YOU?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.997
HOW MUCH
DO I HAVE TO PRETEND?

15:55.164 --> 15:57.791
A LOT. LIKE YOU'RE
STUCK ON ME.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.960
WHAT?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.963
JUST FOR THE REST
OF THE WEEK,
MAYBE NOT THAT LONG.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.760
THE AGGIE
AND THE CLOUDY.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.219
WHAT?

16:15.351 --> 16:16.518
OH...

16:16.685 --> 16:18.729
OH, ALL RIGHT.
THE AGGIE AND THE CLOUDY.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.814
GIVE ME THE MARBLES.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.443
WHEN A PERSON DOES A FAVOR
FOR ANOTHER PERSON,
THE TRADE COMES FIRST,

16:24.610 --> 16:27.029
BUT WHEN A PERSON'S
PAYING FOR A CHORE,

16:27.196 --> 16:30.449
IT COMES AFTER
THE CHORE'S BEEN DONE.

16:30.616 --> 16:34.119
HOLD MY HAND.
SMILE. SMILE.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.291
NOW, DON'T FORGET,
MEET ME BY

16:39.458 --> 16:41.543
THE SWEETHEART TREE
TOMORROW.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.213
BYE.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.923
HI, HENRY.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.678
Charles: HEY, EDWARDS,
LOOK OUT.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.013
HOW YOU DOING THIS MORNING?
WORK GOING ALL RIGHT?

17:35.180 --> 17:36.974
OH, YEAH. FINE.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.184
WORKING HARD
THIS MORNING.

17:39.351 --> 17:40.644
GOT THE HOBSON
ORDER OUT.

17:40.811 --> 17:43.856
IT'S BEEN BUSIER
THAN A BEAR
IN A BEEHIVE.

17:53.657 --> 17:54.450
CHARLES'.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.993
TALK TO YOU
A MINUTE?

17:56.160 --> 17:57.911
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, DOC.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.677
AH, WHAT YOU NEED, DOC?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.360
EDWARDS, COME ON'.
WE GOT WORK TO DO'.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.825
EDWARDS'. COME ON'.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.520
- HEY, YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH. I FEEL FINE.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.855
- THE MISSIS AND THE GIRLS,
THEY FEEL ALL RIGHT?
- EVERYBODY'S WELL.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.857
YOU WORRIED ME,
YOU KNOW, GOING OVER TO
DOC BAKER'S LIKE THAT.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.610
NO. I PROMISED THE DOC
I'D MAKE HIM A HAT RACK.
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.070
OH, WELL, THAT
EXPLAINS IT, THEN.

19:13.237 --> 19:14.947
YEP. GOT TO BE
ON MY WAY.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.575
YOU, UH...
SEE GRACE SNIDER
OVER THERE, DID YOU?

19:18.742 --> 19:20.285
YEAH. SHE'S SITTING
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.120
LOOKS KIND OF
PEAKED, I IMAGINE.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.164
NO. I THOUGHT
SHE LOOKED REAL GOOD.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.833
SEE YOU.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.759
[HUMMING]

19:35.926 --> 19:37.469
WELL, GRACE,

19:37.636 --> 19:39.054
IT'S ALWAYS
ENCOURAGING TO KNOW

19:39.221 --> 19:41.139
ONE OF MY PATIENTS
IS FEELING BETTER.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.767
I'M SURE IT'S YOUR TONIC
THAT DID IT FOR ME, DOCTOR.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.060
I HOPE SO.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.645
AND THANKS FOR
BRINGING THE MAIL.

19:46.812 --> 19:48.480
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR ONE OF THOSE
LETTERS FOR WEEKS.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.441
WELL, IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.855
HOWDY, GRACE. MIGHTY
FINE DAY, ISN'T IT?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.690
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T IT
BE A FINE DAY?

20:31.857 --> 20:33.275
OH, WELL,
SPRING WEATHER, YOU KNOW,

20:33.442 --> 20:34.776
IT'S AS CHANGEABLE
AS A WOMAN

20:34.943 --> 20:36.820
IN FRONT
OF A HAT STORE WINDOW.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.197
YOU KNOW, YOU PREDICTED
THIS WEATHER
LAST WINTER.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.824
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED.

20:40.991 --> 20:41.742
THAT SO?

20:41.909 --> 20:43.660
YOU SAID
THAT WHEN TREES

20:43.827 --> 20:45.203
SPLIT THEIR
BARK IN THE WINTER,

20:45.370 --> 20:47.873
IT'S A SURE SIGN OF
A WARM, DRY SPRING,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.083
AND IT SURELY
SEEMS TO BE.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.543
I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, GRACE,

20:51.710 --> 20:53.170
YOU SURE AIN'T A WOMAN
TO COMPLAIN.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.838
WELL, WHAT WOULD I HAVE
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?

20:55.005 --> 20:56.715
OH, WELL, THERE AIN'T NO
USE IN TRYING TO HIDE IT.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.259
I AIN'T ONE TO PRY, BUT I
COULDN'T HELP NOTICING

20:59.426 --> 21:01.845
ALL THEM TRIPS YOU BEEN
MAKING TO DOC BAKER'S.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.680
WHAT, DID THE SICKNESS
COME ON YOU
ALL OF A SUDDEN, DID IT?

21:03.847 --> 21:06.058
SICKNESS? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.726
WHAT SICKNESS?

21:07.893 --> 21:11.563
WHAT DO--YOU MEAN
HE AIN'T DOCTORING YOU?

21:11.730 --> 21:13.732
WHY, NO. HE DID
GIVE ME A CHECK UP,

21:13.899 --> 21:15.567
AND HE PRESCRIBED
A TONIC,

21:15.734 --> 21:17.569
BUT HE SAYS
I'M IN FINE SHAPE.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.697
WELL, SURE DID
A LOT OF PATTING
WHILE HE WAS TELLING YOU.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.825
WELL, DR. BAKER AND I
ARE OLD FRIENDS.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.370
BESIDES, WE HAD
SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS.

21:26.536 --> 21:30.248
OH. SOMETHING YOU
FORGOT TO DISCUSS WHEN YOU
WAS OVER THERE YESTERDAY?

21:30.415 --> 21:33.418
WE DISCUSSED IT YESTERDAY,
AND WE DISCUSSED IT
TODAY. AND I--

21:33.585 --> 21:35.712
OH, WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT AIN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.589
I JUST COME BY TO SEE
IF YOU WAS ALL RIGHT.

21:37.756 --> 21:38.966
OH, ISAIAH.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.092
ISAIAH,
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.094
ISAIAH'.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.012
ISAIAH'.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.987
WAIT A MINUTE, LAURA.
I'M LOSING MY SHOE.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.739
ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU
HAVEN'T KEPT YOUR
PART OF THE BARGAIN.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.534
I MET YOU BY THE SWEETHEART
TREE, DIDN'T I?

22:05.701 --> 22:09.287
YES. BUT I'M NOT GETTING
MY MARBLES' WORTH.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.249
RECESS IS ALMOST OVER,
AND YOU HAVEN'T HELD
MY HAND ONCE.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.583
I HAD TO GO
TO THE OUTHOUSE.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.127
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO
TO THE OUTHOUSE.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.795
I CAN'T HOLD YOUR HAND
ALL THE TIME.

22:16.962 --> 22:17.879
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
IF YOU WANT THE AGGIE

22:18.046 --> 22:19.589
AND ALL YOUR
OTHER MARBLES BACK.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.299
DON'T FORGET THE CLOUDY.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.427
I DIDN'T, BUT YOU'RE
NOT KEEPING YOUR
PART OF THE BARGAIN.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.263
I CAN'T HOLD HANDS ALL
THE TIME. MY HAND GETS WET.
[BELL RINGING]

22:26.430 --> 22:28.181
MINE, TOO. COME ON.
WE GOT TO GO.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.112
Charles: AHH.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.281
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALL THROUGH WITH YOUR
HOMEWORK, HALF-PINT.

22:44.448 --> 22:46.408
WELL, WE'RE HAVING A BIBLE
QUIZ IN SUNDAY SCHOOL.

22:46.575 --> 22:50.287
OH. WELL, GOOD. I'LL
ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

22:50.454 --> 22:51.788
SEE IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.750
WHERE DO THEY MENTION
BASEBALL IN THE BIBLE?

22:54.916 --> 22:56.376
- BASEBALL?
- MM-HMM.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.420
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY PLAYED
BASEBALL IN THE BIBLE.

22:58.587 --> 23:01.048
MM-HMM. VERY FIRST LINE,
BOOK OF GENESIS...

23:02.507 --> 23:04.968
IN THE "BIG INNING." HA HA'.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.470
CHARLES.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.805
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.808
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TIME
OF DAY GOD CREATED ADAM?

23:11.975 --> 23:13.769
WHAT TIME?

23:13.935 --> 23:15.437
JUST BEFORE EVE.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.649
JUST BEFORE EVE.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.445
I'M GOING TO GO OUTSIDE
AND SMOKE MY PIPE.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.702
Caroline:
IT'S TIME FOR BED.

23:30.869 --> 23:31.870
YOU GIRLS GO AHEAD
AND GET READY.

23:32.037 --> 23:33.622
I'LL BE UP
TO TUCK YOU IN.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.760
PA, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

23:46.927 --> 23:49.054
MM-HMM. IF IT'S NOT
TOO HARD TO ANSWER.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.556
WELL, IS IT RIGHT TO
PRETEND THAT SOMETHING

23:51.723 --> 23:54.226
THAT ISN'T TRUE IS TRUE
IF IT'S IN A GOOD CAUSE?

23:54.392 --> 23:57.145
WELL, THAT ALL DEPENDS ON
WHO'S PRETENDING AND WHY.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.647
GIVE ME A "FOR INSTANCE."

23:58.814 --> 24:00.899
WELL,
THERE'S THIS PERSON,

24:01.066 --> 24:02.275
AND THIS PERSON
IS PRETENDING

24:02.442 --> 24:04.486
TO LIKE SOMEBODY
JUST SO THAT

24:04.653 --> 24:07.280
ANOTHER PERSON WOULD
TAKE NOTICE OF HER.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.199
OH, I SEE. WELL, I THINK
THIS PERSON OUGHT

24:09.366 --> 24:11.409
TO BE VERY CAREFUL
THEY DON'T HURT THAT OTHER
PERSON'S FEELINGS.

24:11.576 --> 24:14.704
YOU KNOW, MAKING PEOPLE
JEALOUS CAN BE
HURTFUL SOMETIMES.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.082
BUT SOMETIMES
IT JUST SPARKS
THEIR INTEREST,

24:17.249 --> 24:19.751
LIKE WHEN MA
MADE SHEEP'S EYES
AT ANOTHER BOY

24:19.918 --> 24:21.586
WHEN YOU TWO
WERE IN SCHOOL.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.088
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

24:23.255 --> 24:24.673
WELL, I HEARD MA
TALKING TO MRS. SNIDER

24:24.840 --> 24:27.926
ABOUT HOW TO GET
MR. EDWARDS TO ASK
HER TO THE DANCE.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.303
OH, I SEE.
WOMEN'S WILES, HUH?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.013
BUT IT DOES WORK,
DOESN'T IT, PA?

24:32.180 --> 24:33.557
MM-HMM. SOMETIMES.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.308
BUT SOMETHING YOU
HAVE TO REMEMBER.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.310
NOW, WOMEN THAT SOW
THE SEEDS OF JEALOUSY

24:37.477 --> 24:40.147
SOMETIMES REAP A LOT MORE
THAN THEY BARGAIN FOR.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.775
I GUESS.
BUT ANY CROP'S

24:43.942 --> 24:45.193
BETTER THAN
NO CROP AT ALL.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.778
[LAUGHING]
I SUPPOSE IT IS.

24:46.945 --> 24:49.406
- GOOD NIGHT, PA.
- GOOD NIGHT, LOVE.

24:49.573 --> 24:51.324
HAVE A GOOD SLEEP.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.845
HMM...THIS NEEDS
MORE SALT.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.807
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU ATE IT ALL.

25:15.974 --> 25:17.392
NO, I SHOULDN'T.
IT WAS MY TURN

25:17.559 --> 25:19.769
TO GET OUT OF BED
AND GET THE SALT.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.485
I DIDN'T REALIZE
"SILAS MARNER" WAS FUNNY.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.197
IT'S NOT "SILAS MARNER."
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT EDWARDS.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.407
OH?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.409
MMM. YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN HIM TODAY.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.244
I'VE SEEN A DOG
CHASING HIS TAIL

25:36.411 --> 25:38.121
WHO WAS HAPPIER
THAN HIM.

25:38.288 --> 25:39.706
WHAT WAS THE MATTER?

25:39.873 --> 25:42.083
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S GOT SOME SILLY
IDEA IN HIS HEAD

25:42.250 --> 25:45.337
THAT SOMETHING'S
GOING ON BETWEEN
GRACE AND DR. BAKER.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.215
HMM. I GUESS THAT'S NOT
SUCH A SILLY IDEA.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.175
GRACE IS
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

25:50.342 --> 25:51.593
I KNOW SHE'S
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN,

25:51.760 --> 25:54.638
BUT EDWARDS HAS GOT
NO REASON TO BE JEALOUS.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.724
QUESTION IS,
WHERE DID HE EVER
GET AN IDEA LIKE THAT?

25:57.891 --> 26:02.270
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION,
CHARLES. GOOD NIGHT.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.411
THERE.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.210
JIGGLE IT.

26:25.377 --> 26:28.880
YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ONE
UNLESS YOU JIGGLE IT.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.298
WHAT'S THE SENSE
OF CATCHING THEM

26:30.465 --> 26:32.259
IF MY MOTHER
WON'T COOK THEM?

26:32.425 --> 26:34.219
I'M GOING TO
HUNT ARROWHEADS.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.971
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO STICK WITH ME.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.597
I WON'T GO FAR.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.182
WILLIE'.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.784
Henry: HI.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.912
WHY, IT'S HENRY HENDERSON.
WHAT YOU DOING
UP HERE, HENRY?

27:01.079 --> 27:02.872
THIS IS THE DAY
YOU SAID THEY'D
BE BITING.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.292
OH, IT IS. LOOK'.

27:07.794 --> 27:11.089
GOLLY, LAURA.
YOU SURE CAUGHT
A MESS OF THEM.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.800
Willie: I'M STARVING.

27:14.884 --> 27:16.886
WE GOT DIBS
ON THIS SPOT, HENRY.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.930
Laura: THERE'S
ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYONE.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.765
FIRST IS FIRST.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.351
TWO IS COMPANY.
THREE IS A CROWD,

27:23.518 --> 27:25.770
AND 4 AND 5 IS 9.

27:27.397 --> 27:29.441
I'M TEACHING WILLIE
HOW TO FISH.

27:29.607 --> 27:32.110
YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING
IF YOU SET YOUR MIND TO IT.

27:32.277 --> 27:34.070
MA'S EVEN TEACHING PA
TO WALTZ.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.322
I CAN DO IT JUST AS GOOD.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.865
YOU GOT A BITE.

27:38.283 --> 27:40.118
LOOKS LIKE A BIG ONE.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.915
JERK THE POLE THAT WAY,
AND YOU'LL LOSE THEM
EVERY TIME.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.096
Kiss me
on the cheek.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.473
What?

28:01.639 --> 28:03.058
You heard me.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.559
I'll throw up.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.936
You want the aggie,
don't you?

28:09.939 --> 28:12.275
WHY, WILLIE OLESON,
MIND YOUR MANNERS.

28:12.442 --> 28:13.735
QUIT IT'.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.153
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO KISS YOU,

28:15.320 --> 28:16.946
YOU SHOULDN'T HOLD
HIS HAND ALL THE TIME.

28:17.113 --> 28:20.492
WELL, HE SHOULDN'T KISS
ME WITHOUT ASKING FIST.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.494
BUT YOU SAID--

28:22.660 --> 28:24.412
STOP IT'.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.538
SHE'S RIGHT.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.707
NOT AN HONORABLE THING
WITHOUT ASKING.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.210
SEE? HENRY KNOWS HOW TO
BEHAVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN,

28:30.377 --> 28:32.087
DON'T YOU, HENRY?

28:32.253 --> 28:35.048
A GENTLEMAN ASKS A GIRL
FOR A KISS OR FOR A DANCE,

28:35.215 --> 28:37.425
DOESN'T HE, HENRY?

28:37.592 --> 28:39.803
I RECKON,
BUT ONE THING
YOU DON'T DO

28:39.969 --> 28:41.763
IS HORN IN ON A PAIR
OF LOVEBIRDS.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.766
SEE YOU. I'LL FIND
MY OWN PLACE TO FISH.

28:50.188 --> 28:52.816
WILLIE OLESON.
SON OF A GUN.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.742
NOTHING EVER WORKS
RIGHT WITH YOU, WILLIE.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.369
BUT I JUST DID
WHAT YOU--

29:04.536 --> 29:06.204
OH, BE QUIET'.

29:09.999 --> 29:12.877
BUT I JUST DID
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO.

29:13.044 --> 29:15.088
DUMB GIRLS.

29:25.515 --> 29:26.683
Charles: HEY'.
HOW YOU DOING, DOC?

29:26.850 --> 29:28.393
HELLO, CHARLES.
THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

29:28.560 --> 29:30.687
AND SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING
WITH THAT HAT RACK.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.981
I GOT IT ALL
FINISHED. COME ON INSIDE.
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.232
GOOD'.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.029
Charles: I THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE IT.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.246
DID A FINE JOB,
CHARLES. FINE JOB.

29:48.413 --> 29:49.914
YOU DO SOME
FANCY CARVING.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.624
WELL,
SO DO YOU, DOC.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.586
WELL, MINE
REQUIRE STITCHES.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.630
YOU KNOW, NORDSTROM WANTS
AN EARLY CROP OF CORN,

29:57.797 --> 29:59.174
BUT HE'S AFRAID NATURE
MIGHT RUN

29:59.340 --> 30:01.426
A LITTLE DAB
OF WINTER BACK ON US.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:01.593 --> 30:03.386
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO
WATCH THE HICKORY TREES.

30:03.553 --> 30:04.971
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
BUD TILL WINTER'S OVER,

30:05.138 --> 30:06.389
NO MATTER HOW NICE
THE SPRING SEEMS.

30:06.556 --> 30:09.058
WELL, I'LL TELL HIM THAT.
HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

30:09.225 --> 30:10.560
AH, JUST GIVE ME
A CREDIT, DOC.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.312
I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

30:12.479 --> 30:15.690
DOC, I GOT 3 GIRLS.
WHEN ONE OF THEM GETS
SICK, THEY ALL GET SICK.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.942
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO
KNOW YOU GOT SOME CREDIT
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.111
WELL, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.279
IT IS.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.281
Caroline: DOCTOR.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.578
DR. BAKER, WOULD YOU
DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

30:28.745 --> 30:29.913
CERTAINLY. IF I CAN.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.373
WILL YOU GIVE THESE
FLOWERS TO GRACE?

30:32.540 --> 30:34.125
SHE FANCIES THEM SO.

30:34.292 --> 30:36.127
BE PLEASED TO.
THEY'RE PRETTY.

30:36.294 --> 30:37.795
THANK YOU.

30:37.962 --> 30:38.796
THANKS AGAIN, CHARLES.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.507
SO LONG, DOC.

30:47.472 --> 30:51.309
CAROLINE, I THINK I KNOW
WHO'S PUTTING THOSE
IDEAS IN EDWARDS' HEAD.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.519
HMM.

30:56.564 --> 30:57.649
[CHUCKLES]

31:04.447 --> 31:06.866
WHOA'. WHOA'.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.326
CHILDREN.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.787
DR. BAKER, CAN I HAVE
A RIDE HOME?

31:10.954 --> 31:13.373
WHY, SURE, WILLIE.
CLIMB UP.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.419
SAY, THAT'S A NICE
STRING OF FISH, LAURA.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.755
THE BIGGEST ONE
GOT AWAY.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.217
THE BIGGEST ONE
GOT AWAY.

31:24.384 --> 31:27.011
OH. MM-HMM.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.555
BYE.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.870
WHOA'. THERE YOU ARE,
WILLIE.

31:53.037 --> 31:55.206
THANK YOU, DR. BAKER.

31:55.373 --> 31:57.125
YOU'RE WELCOME.
ANYTIME.

32:14.142 --> 32:17.186
GRACE, CAROLINE INGALLS
SENT THESE TO YOU.

32:17.353 --> 32:20.315
OH. WHY,
THEY'RE LOVELY.

32:20.481 --> 32:23.067
[LOUDLY]
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BRINGING THEM OVER.

32:23.234 --> 32:26.070
I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

32:26.237 --> 32:29.198
MY PLEASURE. GRACE...

32:29.365 --> 32:31.576
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
HEARING PROBLEMS LATELY?

32:31.743 --> 32:33.661
OH, WHY, NO.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.538
OH, SAY,
I WAS WONDERING,

32:35.705 --> 32:38.499
HAVE YOU FINISHED
THE DICKENS BOOK
THAT I LENT YOU?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.169
OH, YES. YES.
I'LL BRING IT BACK

32:41.336 --> 32:43.254
TONIGHT ON MY WAY HOME
FROM DINNER AT HANSON'S.

32:43.421 --> 32:47.008
OH, NOW THAT
WOULD BE JUST FINE.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.975
OH, EASY, THERE,
EDWARDS. EASY.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.770
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A TOUCH OF INDIGESTION.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.313
YOU COME OVER
TO MY OFFICE,

33:00.480 --> 33:02.732
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO SETTLE
YOUR STOMACH.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.740
DID YOU SEE THAT? MADE ME
SWALLOW MY TOBACCO SO IT
WOULD GIVE ME INDIGESTION

33:10.907 --> 33:12.450
SO HE COULD
CHARGE ME TO CURE IT.

33:12.617 --> 33:15.244
AREN'T THESE
PRETTY, ISAIAH?

33:15.411 --> 33:17.121
SEEMS LIKE A MEDICAL MAN
OUGHT TO HAVE MORE TO DO

33:17.288 --> 33:19.290
THAN JUST DAWDLE AROUND
THE FIELD PICKING POSIES.

33:19.457 --> 33:20.667
OUGHT TO BE TENDING
TO BUSINESS.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.378
OH, ISAIAH, WAS THERE
SOMETHING SPECIAL

33:23.544 --> 33:25.004
YOU CAME IN HERE
TO ASK ME?

33:25.171 --> 33:27.340
MY COUGHING FIT MUST HAVE
KNOCKED IT OUT OF MY HEAD.

33:27.507 --> 33:30.468
ISAIAH, WHY DON'T
YOU COME OVER
AFTER SUPPER TONIGHT

33:30.635 --> 33:31.803
AND HAVE A PIECE
OF CHERRY PIE,

33:31.969 --> 33:33.262
AND THEN BY THAT
TIME, MAYBE YOU'LL

33:33.429 --> 33:34.847
REMEMBER WHAT YOU
WANTED TO ASK ME.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.307
I WAS GOING TO WORK
ON LAURA'S KITE.

33:36.474 --> 33:39.394
I'VE GOT THOSE REMNANTS
ALL READY FOR YOU.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.812
- YOU DO?
- UH-HUH.

33:42.438 --> 33:45.483
WELL...NEVER COULD
RESIST YOUR CHERRY PIE.

33:51.531 --> 33:54.325
CRACKER JACK STORY, GRACE.
CRACKER JACK.

33:54.492 --> 33:58.830
"TALE OF TWO CITIES--"
ADVENTURE, INTRIGUE,

33:58.996 --> 34:01.332
AND A LOVE STORY THAT BRINGS
TEARS TO YOUR EYES.

34:01.499 --> 34:05.044
OH, YOU KNOW, I'VE
HAD TEARS IN MY EYES
ALL AFTERNOON, DOCTOR.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.172
I THINK I MUST HAVE
A SPECK OF DUST
IN THIS ONE.

34:08.339 --> 34:11.175
WELL, THEN, COME
OVER HERE TO THE LIGHT,
AND LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

34:14.929 --> 34:18.266
NOW, BEND DOWN A LITTLE.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.351
MM-HMM. NOW UP.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.311
♪ OLD DAN TUCKER
WAS A FINE OLD MAN ♪

34:22.478 --> 34:24.272
♪ WASHED HIS FACE
IN A FRYIN' PAN ♪

34:24.439 --> 34:26.065
♪ COMBED HIS HAIR
WITH A WAGON WHEEL ♪

34:26.232 --> 34:29.569
♪ DIED WITH A TOOTHACHE
IN HIS HEEL ♪

34:29.736 --> 34:30.862
WELL, YOU...

34:32.488 --> 34:34.907
AHA'. AHA'. AIN'T THIS
A FINE HOW-DO-YOU-DO?

34:35.074 --> 34:36.409
ISAIAH,
YOU'RE EARLY.

34:36.576 --> 34:38.911
WHAT, YOU GOT THIS
WORKED OUT LIKE
A RAILROAD TIMETABLE?

34:39.078 --> 34:40.538
HE'S THE 8:00,
I ROLL IN AT 9:00?

34:40.705 --> 34:42.373
WHAT IN THE DEVIL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:42.540 --> 34:43.583
OH, DON'T PLAY INNOCENT
WITH ME.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.251
I CAUGHT THE TWO OF YOU
DEAD TO RIGHTS.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.378
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO GET A SPECK OF
DUST OUT OF MY EYE.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.297
WELL, MAYBE I OUGHT
TO PUT SOMETHING
IN YOUR EYE, LIKE A FIST.

34:49.464 --> 34:50.381
WHAT?

34:50.548 --> 34:51.799
WELL, THEN
ON SECOND THOUGHT, MAYBE

34:51.966 --> 34:53.426
I OUGHTN'T TO HIT A MAN
WHO DONE ME A GOOD TURN,

34:53.593 --> 34:55.553
SHOWED ME HOW FICKLE-HEARTED
YOU COULD BE.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.473
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAT I FOUND IT OUT NOW
THAN BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

34:58.639 --> 35:02.268
- ISAIAH'.
- NOW, JUST A MINUTE,
EDWARDS'. NOW--EDWARDS'.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.031
IT JUST ISN'T WORKING.

35:15.198 --> 35:16.574
WHAT'S NOT
WORKING?

35:16.741 --> 35:18.409
I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME
WITH WILLIE.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.328
I SHARED
MY LUNCH WITH HIM,

35:20.495 --> 35:23.206
AND I EVEN LET HENRY
SEE HIM GIVE ME
A KISS ON THE CHEEK,

35:23.372 --> 35:25.416
BUT HE'S NOT
JEALOUS AT ALL.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.001
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.
NOBODY WOULD BE

35:27.168 --> 35:30.171
JEALOUS OF WILLIE,
EXCEPT MAYBE A GOPHER.

35:30.338 --> 35:31.923
MAYBE THAT'S IT.
WELL, ANYWAY,

35:32.089 --> 35:33.841
I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING
DIFFERENT TODAY--

35:34.008 --> 35:36.344
PEAR-BUTTER SANDWICHES.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.763
FEELS LIKE
YOU GOT ENOUGH
FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.890
THAT'S BECAUSE HENRY
LIKES THEM A LOT.

35:41.057 --> 35:43.935
SO AFTER LUNCH,
HE'S JUST GOT TO ASK ME
OUT TO THE DANCE.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.020
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.
IF HE EATS ALL THOSE,

35:46.187 --> 35:48.648
DR. BAKER MAY JUST PUT
HIM TO BED FOR A WEEK.

35:48.815 --> 35:49.816
YOU REALLY
THINK SO?

35:49.982 --> 35:52.735
HA HA'. NO. I'M JUST KIDDING.

35:52.902 --> 35:55.571
SOUNDS LIKE THE BEST IDEA
YOU'VE HAD YET. GOOD LUCK.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.031
THANKS.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.288
I CAN'T FIND
MY LUNCH ANYWHERE.

36:04.455 --> 36:06.207
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY WILLIE?

36:13.089 --> 36:15.633
WAIT HERE. I THINK
I FOUND MY LUNCH.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.849
WILLIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY LUNCH?

36:23.015 --> 36:24.642
PEAR BUTTER'S
MY FAVORITE'.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.185
THERE'S NONE LEFT
FOR HENRY.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.230
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HENRY ANYMORE.

36:29.397 --> 36:31.357
I'M GOING TO DO
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED.

36:31.524 --> 36:33.234
STOP IT, WILLIE.

36:33.401 --> 36:35.486
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU ACT THAT WAY.

36:37.488 --> 36:38.614
SORRY, HENRY,

36:38.781 --> 36:40.366
BUT WILLIE ATE ALL
THE PEAR-BUTTER SANDWICHES.

36:40.533 --> 36:44.036
I HAVE SOME BROWN SUGAR
AND CINNAMON LEFT
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.830
STOP IT'.

36:45.997 --> 36:47.999
YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE SOME BROWN SUGAR
AND CINNAMON?

36:48.165 --> 36:51.085
THANKS, BUT I GOT MY OWN
BACON SANDWICHES INSIDE.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.045
WASN'T VERY HUNGRY
ANYWAY.

36:56.674 --> 36:58.551
GUESS IT REALLY
WORKED THAT TIME.

36:58.718 --> 37:00.177
HE SURE DOES LOOK MAD.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.596
HE'S NOT. I AM.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.014
NO REASON TO BE.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.267
IF HE DON'T TAKE YOU
TO THE DANCE, I WILL,

37:06.434 --> 37:08.769
BUT YOU STILL GOT
TO PAY ME MY MARBLES.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.925
LAURA, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,
YOU BETTER GET TO SLEEP.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.593
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO SLEEP

37:40.760 --> 37:42.720
IF TOMORROW'S
MY LAST CHANCE?

37:42.887 --> 37:45.139
YOU COULD GO TO
THE DANCE WITH WILLIE.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.724
I'D RATHER BE
A WALLFLOWER

37:46.891 --> 37:49.060
THAN GO TO THE DANCE
WITH WILLIE.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.229
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

37:52.396 --> 37:54.815
I HAVE TO TALK
TO MA.

37:59.362 --> 38:02.156
HEY, NOW,
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP SO LATE?

38:02.323 --> 38:03.616
YOU'RE NOT FEELING
SICK, ARE YOU?

38:03.783 --> 38:06.786
NO, PA, BUT I WISH I WAS.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.746
THEN I'D HAVE AN EXCUSE

38:08.913 --> 38:10.831
NOT TO GO
TO THE SPRING DANCE.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.416
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

38:12.583 --> 38:14.085
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED DANCING.

38:14.251 --> 38:17.922
I DO. IT'S FUN WHEN
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PARTNER.

38:18.089 --> 38:19.382
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF BOYS THERE.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.550
YOU'LL HAVE
LOTS OF PARTNERS.

38:21.717 --> 38:22.927
NOT A SPECIAL ONE.

38:23.094 --> 38:26.055
WELL,
YOU GOT ME.

38:26.222 --> 38:28.140
I LOVE YOU, PA...

38:30.101 --> 38:31.769
BUT IT'S JUST NOT LIKE
HAVING A BOY

38:31.936 --> 38:33.980
ASK YOU OUT
TO THE DANCE.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.190
WELL, THERE'S
STILL TOMORROW.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.776
MAYBE SOMEBODY
WILL INVITE YOU TOMORROW.

38:38.943 --> 38:40.653
MAYBE. BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.989
I TRIED WHAT YOU SAID.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.240
WHAT I SAID?

38:44.407 --> 38:48.035
ABOUT MAKING HIM
JEALOUS LIKE YOU
DID TO PA,

38:48.202 --> 38:50.788
LIKE YOU TOLD
MRS. SNIDER.

38:52.623 --> 38:54.625
IT WORKED
WITH PA, BUT I

38:54.792 --> 38:57.336
MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING WRONG

38:57.503 --> 39:00.464
BECAUSE IT JUST
ISN'T WORKING
WITH HENRY.

39:00.631 --> 39:02.842
WELL, I WOULDN'T STAY
UP THE WHOLE NIGHT
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

39:03.009 --> 39:05.928
YOU GET SOME SLEEP.
EVERYTHING ALWAYS LOOKS
BRIGHTER IN THE MORNING.

39:06.095 --> 39:07.847
YES, SIR. GOOD NIGHT, MA.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.975
GOOD NIGHT.
SWEET DREAMS.

39:11.142 --> 39:13.019
- GOOD NIGHT, PA.
- GOOD NIGHT, DARLING.

39:18.691 --> 39:20.651
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN SOMETHING WAS
WRONG WHEN SHE

39:20.818 --> 39:22.820
STARTED TAKING UP
WITH WILLIE OLESON.

39:23.946 --> 39:25.573
SHE MUST HAVE OVERHEARD
WHAT I SAID TO GRACE

39:25.740 --> 39:27.199
AND APPLIED IT
TO HER OWN SITUATION.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.201
FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND, IT'S NOT

39:29.368 --> 39:31.287
WORKING OUT TOO WELL
FOR GRACE EITHER.

39:31.454 --> 39:32.580
NO, IT ISN'T.

39:32.747 --> 39:35.124
I WISH I'D KEPT OUT
OF THE WHOLE THING.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.418
WELL, CAROLINE, YOU
KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

39:37.585 --> 39:38.711
FOR A WOMAN NOT
TO GIVE ADVICE ON

39:38.878 --> 39:41.255
HOW TO SNARE A MAN,
EVEN IF IT'S WRONG.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.717
WELL, AT LEAST
IT WAS SOUND ADVICE.
IT WORKED ON YOU.

39:45.843 --> 39:48.596
WELL, SURE IT DID,
UP TO A POINT.
I GOT ANGRY.

39:48.763 --> 39:50.514
JUST AS ANGRY
AS EDWARDS,

39:50.681 --> 39:56.020
OR DON'T YOU
REMEMBER THAT. HMM?

39:56.187 --> 39:57.438
OH'.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.483
I HAD FORGOTTEN.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.194
I IMAGINE
YOU ALSO FORGOT

40:03.360 --> 40:05.446
YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT ENDED UP ASKING
ME TO THE DANCE.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.325
YOU DO
REMEMBER THAT.

40:11.202 --> 40:12.244
YES.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.207
SOUND ADVICE.

40:18.292 --> 40:19.710
CAROLINE,
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,

40:19.877 --> 40:21.962
TELL THE TRUTH.

40:22.129 --> 40:23.631
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.841
AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH.

40:31.972 --> 40:34.683
Caroline: MEMORY
IS A CAPRICIOUS THING,

40:34.850 --> 40:41.816
AND SOMETIMES 2 PEOPLE
REMEMBER THE SAME THING

40:41.982 --> 40:43.692
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

40:45.236 --> 40:49.490
I MEAN, AS THE YEARS GO BY,

40:49.657 --> 40:53.035
SOMETIMES WE FORGET
THE LITTLE DETAILS...

40:54.078 --> 40:58.249
ESPECIALLY SOME OF
THE SMALL SETBACKS.

40:59.917 --> 41:02.169
LAST NIGHT,
CHARLES REMINDED ME

41:02.336 --> 41:05.840
OF THE MISSING INGREDIENT
IN THE RECIPE I GAVE YOU--

41:06.006 --> 41:08.008
OF WHAT TO DO
IF THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.970
BUT PA WAS JEALOUS.
HE SAID HE WAS.

41:11.137 --> 41:15.015
YES. HE WAS ALSO
VERY ANGRY...

41:15.182 --> 41:17.601
AND TOO PROUD TO LET ON.

41:17.768 --> 41:22.982
AND SO I HAD
TO TRACK HIM DOWN,

41:23.149 --> 41:28.028
CONFESS MY DECEPTION,
AND ASK HIM TO THE DANCE.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.321
BUT THE GIRLS

41:29.488 --> 41:31.907
AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO DO THE ASKING.

41:32.074 --> 41:35.077
ISAIAH WOULD NEVER LET
ME HEAR THE END OF IT.

41:36.996 --> 41:38.164
WELL, SWALLOWING
YOUR PRIDE

41:38.330 --> 41:40.166
DOESN'T GIVE YOU
INDIGESTION...

41:40.332 --> 41:42.376
IF IT PUTS THINGS TO RIGHTS.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.795
WELL, THE WORST
THEY CAN SAY IS NO,

41:44.962 --> 41:47.882
AND YOU'D BE NO WORSE OFF
THAN YOU ARE NOW.

42:11.197 --> 42:11.989
CHARLES.

42:12.156 --> 42:13.365
HI, GRACE.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.117
HAVE YOU SEEN ISAIAH?

42:15.284 --> 42:16.911
HE WAS HERE
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

42:17.077 --> 42:19.663
HE'S BEEN ALL OVER TOWN
"JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO"

42:19.830 --> 42:21.290
ALL MORNING LONG.

42:21.457 --> 42:24.627
WELL, I CAN'T
SPEND ANY MORE TIME
TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

42:24.793 --> 42:26.545
IF YOU DO SEE HIM,
WOULD YOU TELL HIM

42:26.712 --> 42:28.172
THERE'S A PACKAGE FOR HIM
OVER AT THE POST OFFICE?

42:28.339 --> 42:29.423
I'LL DO IT.

42:29.590 --> 42:30.966
THANKS A LOT.

42:36.597 --> 42:37.681
PSST'.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.142
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP THERE?

42:40.309 --> 42:42.686
GRACE WAS
JUST LOOKING FOR YOU.

42:42.853 --> 42:44.188
WHAT DID SHE WANT?

42:44.355 --> 42:47.524
SHE SAID SHE HAD
A PACKAGE FOR YOU
OVER AT THE POST OFFICE.

42:47.691 --> 42:51.695
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU.
SEE, I AIN'T EXPECTING ONE.

42:51.862 --> 42:55.199
THAT THERE'S JUST A TRICK
TO GET ME OVER THERE
SO SHE CAN BAWL ME OUT.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.702
WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE
A MOUNTAIN MAN

42:58.869 --> 42:59.912
WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF
FIGHTING A GRIZZLY BEAR

43:00.079 --> 43:01.497
TO BE AFRAID OF A WOMAN.

43:01.664 --> 43:04.541
AFRAID? NOW, WHO'S AFRAID?
I AIN'T AFRAID OF NOTHING'.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.543
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OVER AND PICK UP
YOUR PACKAGE, THEN?

43:06.710 --> 43:08.254
THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

43:10.798 --> 43:12.967
YOU--YOU SURE YOU DON'T
NEED SOME HELP WITH THAT?

43:13.133 --> 43:14.134
NO. I CAN HANDLE THIS
ALL BY MYSELF FINE.

43:14.301 --> 43:15.552
- YOU'RE SURE?
- MM-HMM.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.012
OH.

43:17.179 --> 43:21.892
WELL, UH...GUESS I'LL
GO PICK UP MY PACKAGE.

43:37.658 --> 43:39.702
MRS. SNIDER, I COME
FOR MY PACKAGE.

43:44.248 --> 43:45.833
THEY SAY THE WAY
TO A MAN'S HEART

43:46.000 --> 43:47.918
IS THROUGH HIS STOMACH.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.503
YOU MUST BE
COLLECTING HEARTS

43:49.670 --> 43:51.505
THE WAY GERONIMO
COLLECTS SCALPS.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.340
IT'S DOWNRIGHT
SHAMEFUL.

43:53.507 --> 43:54.925
OH, I ADMIT IT'.

43:55.092 --> 43:56.885
I HAVE BEEN SHAMEFUL,

43:57.052 --> 43:59.138
USING POOR, INNOCENT
DR. BAKER TO GET YOU JEALOUS

43:59.305 --> 44:00.514
JUST SO YOU'D BREAK DOWN

44:00.681 --> 44:02.141
AND INVITE ME TO
THE SPRING DANCE.

44:02.308 --> 44:03.934
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO ASK ME,

44:04.101 --> 44:06.603
I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK YOU.

44:06.770 --> 44:08.981
WELL, YES OR NO?

44:10.899 --> 44:12.651
NEVER COULD RESIST
YOUR CHERRY PIE.

44:12.818 --> 44:14.111
HA HA.

44:27.124 --> 44:30.044
AH, COME ON,
SLOW POKE. HURRY UP.

44:30.210 --> 44:33.922
YOU GO ON AHEAD.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
WALKING FAST.

45:05.788 --> 45:07.456
WOULD YOU
QUIT FOLLOWING ME?

45:07.623 --> 45:08.582
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE,

45:08.749 --> 45:10.584
AND I PROMISED
TO STICK WITH YOU.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.294
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANYMORE.

45:12.461 --> 45:13.420
WHY NOT?

45:13.587 --> 45:16.173
YOU JUST DON'T,
THAT'S ALL.

45:16.340 --> 45:18.801
Willie:
I WANT 2 MORE.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.095
THE AGGIE AND THE CLOUDY
WAS ALL I PROMISED.

45:21.261 --> 45:24.431
IT WILL TAKE 2 MORE
TO UNSTICK ME.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.726
THOSE 2.

45:27.893 --> 45:30.312
WELL, HURRY UP AND TAKE
THEM AND GET OUT OF HERE.

45:39.196 --> 45:42.366
HENRY, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

45:42.533 --> 45:43.909
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
KNOW-IT-ALL WILLIE?

45:44.076 --> 45:45.244
YOU'RE SO STUCK
ON HIM.

45:45.411 --> 45:46.412
I'M NOT STUCK ON HIM.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.580
I SAW YOU
GIVING HIM MARBLES.

45:51.542 --> 45:52.418
Laura: HENRY'.

45:52.584 --> 45:54.086
HENRY'.

45:54.253 --> 45:56.588
HENRY, WAIT A MINUTE.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.841
THE MARBLES I GAVE
HIM WERE FOR A TRADE.

45:59.007 --> 45:59.925
FOR WHAT?

46:00.092 --> 46:02.553
FOR YOU,
ONLY IT DIDN'T WORK.

46:02.719 --> 46:06.765
YOU SEE, I WANTED
TO GO TO THE SPRING
DANCE WITH YOU,

46:06.932 --> 46:09.309
ONLY YOU
WOULDN'T ASK ME,

46:09.476 --> 46:10.644
SO I THOUGHT THAT
IF YOU THOUGHT

46:10.811 --> 46:12.104
THAT SOMEBODY
ELSE LIKED ME...

46:12.271 --> 46:15.357
YOU MEAN YOU DID IT ON
PURPOSE ON ACCOUNT OF ME?

46:17.734 --> 46:19.027
WILL YOU TAKE ME?

46:21.238 --> 46:23.198
I RECKON...IF YOU
CAN SHOW ME SOME STEPS,

46:23.365 --> 46:25.617
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE SORE TOES.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.995
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT TOUGH TOES.

46:28.162 --> 46:29.246
SEE YOU'.

46:44.052 --> 46:46.263
[PLAYING A WALTZ]

47:16.835 --> 47:20.005
IT'S LIKE I SAID,
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS...

47:20.172 --> 47:21.173
TELL THE TRUTH.

47:21.340 --> 47:22.466
MM-HMM. THAT'S RIGHT.

47:22.633 --> 47:24.635
CHARLES, DON'T YOU
WANT TO DANCE?

47:24.801 --> 47:26.887
CAROLINE, I WAS JUST
WAITING FOR YOU TO ASK ME.
