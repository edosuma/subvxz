WEBVTT

00:09.458 --> 00:13.833
Ugh! That little shit,
treating us like Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:13.833 --> 00:16.625
Buzz again. You know that lazy B is home.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.833
Sarah, come on, honey. Please.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.583
I brought your favorite.
Entenmann's Danish.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.000
I don't want to talk,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.166
and I haven't liked Danishes
since I was ten.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.791
Please, let me in.

00:27.791 --> 00:30.833
I don't wanna be yelling on the street
like a hooligan.

00:30.833 --> 00:34.083
Well, maybe you can feed the Danish
to one of your cyber skanks.

00:34.083 --> 00:38.583
"Cyber skanks"? Her name was Deb,
and she was a class act.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.041
Paul, you know it's never too late
to spank your child.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.666
Sarah, I am your father.
You cannot just not talk to me.

00:44.666 --> 00:49.250
Hey, Walter, in your opinion,
is Paul senile or just stupid?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.208
Uh, excuse me?

00:50.208 --> 00:52.166
Because he seems very confused

00:52.166 --> 00:55.500
about what Sarah's made
perfectly fucking clear.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.750
Ugh!

00:56.750 --> 01:00.041
I had to drive to New Jersey
for this thing.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.791
You know what else belongs in the garbage?

01:02.791 --> 01:05.791
Your daughter. She's trash!

01:05.791 --> 01:07.833
Uh, Walter?

01:07.833 --> 01:09.541
That was my car.

01:09.541 --> 01:11.833
Oh, it's okay, honey.
This is all in your head.

01:11.833 --> 01:14.125
And you need a new car anyway.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.583
Is that in my head too?

01:15.583 --> 01:17.958
Shit. I don't know all the rules. Run!

Ugh! Why don't they make coffee mugs
wide enough to fit Pop-Tarts?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.541
- I need my tart wet.
- Shh!

02:02.541 --> 02:04.666
Hey. Walter and Van are going at it.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.541
No, you tell Sarah
that when her father comes to her house,

02:07.541 --> 02:09.833
you let him in the goddamn door.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.500
Nah, not gonna tell her that.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.958
It's one thing to ruin Sarah's life,
but now you're fucking up my shit.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.166
Not my problem.

02:16.166 --> 02:19.458
So you can take your hysterics
and shove 'em up your saggy ass.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.375
My ass is the opposite of saggy,

02:21.375 --> 02:25.125
and if anyone is hysterical, it's you!

02:26.958 --> 02:29.250
Ugh, Van's impossible, right?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.583
Uh, yeah.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.333
So, uh, what's your plan
for cracking that nut?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.833
I ain't cracking shit.

02:34.833 --> 02:37.416
I will not let myself
be turned into a Hate Worm.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.875
- Wait! No.
- Not again. Not this time, bitch.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.708
Sarah needs love more than ever.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.250
Uh, remember what you taught me?
"Love doubles down"?

02:44.250 --> 02:45.500
Enough, Emmy!

02:45.500 --> 02:49.458
When I said that,
I was trying to inspire a young, dumb bug.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.583
- But you're not that young anymore.
- What? Yes, I am.

02:52.583 --> 02:57.458
Paul is better off without his cruel,
selfish daughter in his life, and so am I.

02:57.458 --> 03:00.208
But Paul can't give up on Sarah.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.375
Nah, don't listen to him.
We're still young, baby.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.958
Rick, is your nose bleeding?

03:04.958 --> 03:07.666
It's that time of the month,
if you know what I mean.

03:07.666 --> 03:11.000
I mean, it's when my mom
has to change my pillowcases.

03:12.791 --> 03:15.875
No tour of Notre Shame
would be complete without visiting

03:15.875 --> 03:17.708
the Department
of Reckoning with Genocide.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.375
Ugh. What in the fuck?

03:19.375 --> 03:20.708
And if you look over there,

03:20.708 --> 03:24.041
you'll see one of our students
crumbling under the enormous pressure.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.458
I haven't slept in a week.

03:26.458 --> 03:29.083
I started drinking my own urine.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.666
Good heavens.

03:30.666 --> 03:32.958
This college is magnificent!

03:32.958 --> 03:34.708
Are you out of your fucking mind?

03:34.708 --> 03:37.333
- Connie...
- What? This place sucks.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.708
I know. Notre Shame's a fricking bummer.

03:39.708 --> 03:42.541
But shouldn't Montel decide
where they wanna go to college?

03:42.541 --> 03:44.291
No. We're the parents.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.583
And I don't wanna pay
for this fucked-up shame factory.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.000
Holy sweet shit in a mini fridge.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.500
Is that Rita St. Swithens?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.375
Yeah. Not to brag, but she once told me
I'd never amount to anything.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.000
- Um, Professor St. Swithens?
- Yes?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.791
I'm your biggest fan.

03:58.791 --> 04:02.083
I've read all your books,
and, oh, I love your coat.

04:02.083 --> 04:05.208
It's made from panda bear.
PETA hates Rita.

04:05.208 --> 04:09.125
Oh, I'm also
being mentored by Lionel.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.833
- Lionel?
- Y-Your son.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.041
You're not actually proud
to be his protégé, are you?

04:14.041 --> 04:16.625
Uh, based on your tone, I'd say no.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.000
I don't actually like him.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.291
I'm just running
an elaborate honeypot scheme

04:21.291 --> 04:24.375
where I lure him into a #MeToo scandal
and ruin his career.

04:24.375 --> 04:28.916
Darling, one must have a career
for it to be ruined.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.375
Oh my God, I made her laugh.

04:31.375 --> 04:34.375
I wanna do that every day
for the rest of my life.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.541
Ooh, I can't wait to go to Notre Shame.

04:36.541 --> 04:40.666
No! Before you decide,
you have to at least see Fuck University.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.791
Connie, it's Montel's choice.

04:42.791 --> 04:44.666
But Fuck U is where we met.

04:44.666 --> 04:48.708
It's where I became
the bad bitch I am today.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.625
Come on, honey.
Don't you wanna be a bad bitch?

04:51.625 --> 04:54.500
Oh, Connie Mommy. I already am.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.750
Okay, but did you consider

04:56.750 --> 04:58.708
I'll buy you a car if you look at Fuck U.

04:58.708 --> 05:02.833
Done. I want a Kia Soul,
and I'm gonna drive it to Chipotle.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.041
Of course she's not picking up.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.666
Sarah thinks you're moving on too fast?

05:08.666 --> 05:10.416
We'll show her moving on.

05:10.416 --> 05:13.583
<i>Heya, it's Sarah.
Leave a massage at the boop.</i>

05:13.583 --> 05:14.500
<i>Boop!</i>

05:14.500 --> 05:17.208
Sarah, it's your father, Paul.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.416
- Remember me?
- Ooh, you nailed her.

05:19.416 --> 05:22.000
I'd have preferred to tell you in person,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
<i>but, uh, it's time for me
to sell the house.</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:26.041
Is this a joke?

05:26.041 --> 05:29.916
<i>So, if you want any of your old stuff,
you need to get it this weekend.</i>

05:29.916 --> 05:32.750
<i>Again, this is your father.</i>

05:32.750 --> 05:33.833
<i>- Goodbye.
-</i> Fuck!

05:34.416 --> 05:37.125
Screw him. You are not going up there.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.625
I don't know. What about my stuff?

05:38.625 --> 05:41.333
Like old pictures and-- and--
and my old yearbooks.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.500
If any of that crap
was actually important,

05:43.500 --> 05:44.708
you'd already have it here.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.625
- Yeah. I-I guess you're right.
- I'm always right.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.541
Remember when you were a kid, and I knew

05:49.541 --> 05:51.958
that Miley and Hannah Montana
were the same person?

05:51.958 --> 05:54.833
You did. I still can't believe it.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.916
So, this is the Fuck University quad.

05:57.916 --> 06:02.333
It's where I used to hang out,
study, get my thang licked.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.875
Ooh, and this is the founder
of Fuck University,

06:04.875 --> 06:06.625
Dr. Charles Copulation.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.708
- Chuckie Fuckie.
- Yeah, the statue's also a lube dispenser.

06:09.708 --> 06:13.541
Go ahead, Montel. Yank Chuckie's dick
and put your hand under his asshole.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.083
- I'm sorry. This place is a school?
- Yeah, more or less.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.125
I <i>think</i> they gave out grades.

06:18.125 --> 06:22.416
- Oh my God! It's Connie LaCienega!
- You are a Delta Cream Pi legend.

06:22.416 --> 06:26.333
Ooh, Connie, you should do
the DCP stroll with them.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.458
- Yes!
- Please.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.416
Oh, no. I couldn't.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.791
I-I'm sure I don't even
remember the steps.

06:32.791 --> 06:34.291
Or do I?

06:34.291 --> 06:37.500
<i>Beauty and brains
Yeah, we work hard</i>

06:37.500 --> 06:40.708
<i>DCP is running this yard</i>

06:40.708 --> 06:43.875
<i>Cute, seductive, humble, and fly</i>

06:43.875 --> 06:46.750
<i>We are the sisters of Delta Cream Pi</i>

06:47.833 --> 06:50.666
Ooh, Connie, get over here
and stomp my yard.

06:50.666 --> 06:51.708
Ugh.

06:51.708 --> 06:55.750
I have been entertained, yes,
but not swayed. Ahh!

06:55.750 --> 06:57.833
Aw, man. [chuckles] Sorry, bro.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.125
Oh dear. Ooh! They grow 'em big
where you're from.

07:00.125 --> 07:03.958
I'm Clarence.
Are you in my Analinguistics class?

07:03.958 --> 07:07.458
I am not. Uh, I'm just here on a tour
with my parents.

07:07.458 --> 07:11.875
Bro, you can't see
the real Fuck U with your parents.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.541
Come on. I'll show you around.

07:13.541 --> 07:17.625
Oh, that's, uh, very kind,
but I'm actually going to a real college,

07:17.625 --> 07:20.500
like, where people drink their own urine
'cause it's so hard.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.000
So, uh, I think we'll be leaving now.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.625
Doesn't look like
your parents are ready to leave yet.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.541
We're Montel's mom and dad.

07:29.541 --> 07:30.958
Hi, sweetie!

07:30.958 --> 07:33.625
Let's get out of here
before they start rimmin' each other.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.250
Oh, great idea!

07:43.875 --> 07:45.083
Do you have a wine opener?

07:45.083 --> 07:48.083
I usually have one in my car,
but I threw it out the window at a cop.

07:48.083 --> 07:51.458
- It's not even 11:00. Are you okay?
- Obviously not.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.666
Van has totally isolated Sarah
from her father,

07:54.666 --> 07:58.208
and she won't even let her
think about her poor dead mother.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.416
- Emmy, she's not your client anymore.
- I don't care.

08:01.416 --> 08:05.291
If I could just get Sarah
to go visit her dad,

08:05.291 --> 08:07.083
I know I could help them work it out.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.458
But sadly, you're a Lovebug,
and Van can't stand Lovebugs,

08:10.458 --> 08:11.708
so she'll never listen to you.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.583
But she'll listen
to a Logic Rock.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.750
- Pete.
- What?

08:17.750 --> 08:20.750
Do you know
why I'm singing your name?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.708
It's 'cause
I'm gonna make you do a thang<i>.</i>

08:25.000 --> 08:28.375
- Hello, Van. It's me, Pete.
- Can I help you?

08:28.375 --> 08:31.375
Uh, how would you like
a free bottle of wine?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.875
It has not been opened.

08:32.875 --> 08:36.000
Why are you giving me free wine?
Where did you get it?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.666
- Um...
- Say you found it.

08:37.666 --> 08:39.291
Uh... I found it, uh...

08:39.291 --> 08:41.458
In the trash.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.583
You found this bottle in the trash?

08:43.583 --> 08:45.625
Great. She's asking questions.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.625
Okay, now get her drunk,
take off your shirt, and sit on her lap.

08:48.625 --> 08:49.791
- What?!
- <i>Come on.</i>

08:49.791 --> 08:52.750
<i>If you did that to me,
I'd do whatever you wanted.</i>

08:52.750 --> 08:54.416
- Hello?
- Um... Ugh.

08:54.416 --> 08:57.541
Look, Van, I saw Walter
blowing his top at you,

08:57.541 --> 09:00.916
and, honestly, I don't like
seeing Logic Rocks disrespected.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.125
Ugh, yeah, he needs to back
the fuck up and get off my crotch.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.791
<i>Pete, are you nude yet? I cannot see.</i>

09:06.791 --> 09:09.708
There is no way Sarah's going
to get her stuff from that house.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.875
Right. Of course.
It's just, uh...

09:12.875 --> 09:14.541
- What?
- Well, uh...

09:14.541 --> 09:16.291
I mean, it's <i>her</i> stuff,

09:16.291 --> 09:21.000
and if Paul throws it out,
he kinda gets the last laugh, right?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.166
Interesting logic.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.208
Oh my God, it's working!

09:24.208 --> 09:25.375
<i>Your nakedness is working.</i>

09:25.375 --> 09:27.166
Honestly, if it were my client,

09:27.166 --> 09:30.250
I'd have Sarah go grab her stuff,
so she can get Paul out of her life.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.458
- Right. Cut the cord.
- Rip off the Band-Aid.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.333
Walter will hate that.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.666
Thanks, Pete.
It's always nice to talk Rock to Rock.

09:37.666 --> 09:40.166
- Pete! We did it.
<i>- I</i> did it.

09:40.166 --> 09:43.083
Wait, how did you get dressed so fast?
I was hoping to catch a glimpse.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.000
- Emmy, please go.
- Okay.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.166
Oh, and there's the Wreck Area.
if you wanna get your asshole wrecked.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.666
Or your pussy. Or your mouth.

09:50.666 --> 09:52.833
Cool. Yeah. Any hole. I get it.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.916
I didn't want you to think
it was only for assholes.

09:54.916 --> 09:55.833
Woo!

09:55.833 --> 09:59.416
Um, these facilities are all very sexy,

09:59.416 --> 10:02.916
but don't you feel ashamed
wasting your parents' money

10:02.916 --> 10:05.041
on rimmin' butts and rearranging guts?

10:05.041 --> 10:08.916
Yo, fam,
I can see you're a Shame Wizard,

10:08.916 --> 10:12.458
but there's nothing shameful
about having fun in college.

10:12.458 --> 10:15.041
Making mistakes is a part of growing up.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.875
Wow, that's a surprisingly
intelligent perspective.

10:17.875 --> 10:21.416
Whoa! My dick's hard.
You wanna come to my room?

10:22.250 --> 10:24.416
Wow. [chuckles] Cool room.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.375
Anyway, shall we make
good use of my hard dick?

10:28.375 --> 10:30.708
You bet!

10:30.708 --> 10:35.333
But, um, I know I seem
like a wizard of the world,

10:35.333 --> 10:37.583
but it's actually my first time.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.625
Oh! No worries, bro.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.666
We don't have to do anything
if you don't want to.

10:42.666 --> 10:45.041
No, I want to.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.250
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.000
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.791
even when sex sucks,
it's still pretty chill.

10:51.791 --> 10:54.416
Actually, that kinda does.

10:54.416 --> 10:59.541
So, uh, wanna give me a tour
of your... butt campus?

10:59.541 --> 11:01.708
- Admission granted.
- Mm!

11:02.750 --> 11:04.208
This is so weird.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.041
I haven't been back since the funeral.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.625
Hey, I'm not gonna let
anything in there hurt you.

11:08.625 --> 11:12.125
Let's go get your "precious heirlooms"
or whatever, and get out.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.416
Hello, Sarah.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.541
I'm gonna get my stuff,
then I'll be out of your hair.

11:16.541 --> 11:17.791
- Good!
- We don't have to talk.

11:17.791 --> 11:20.291
- I don't wanna talk.
- I don't wanna talk to you either.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.208
Perfect.

11:21.208 --> 11:25.083
Me and Sarah and you two old assholes
not talking to each other.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.791
I'm not old! I am timeless!

11:27.791 --> 11:29.041
Just so you know,

11:29.041 --> 11:32.125
I have big plans, Sarah,
and they don't include you!

11:33.166 --> 11:39.125
Yes, I'd like to order a one-person pizza,
just enough for me.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.208
Yeah, you show her.

11:41.791 --> 11:43.750
In and out.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.291
- Surprise!
- What the--

11:45.291 --> 11:47.750
Jesus, you're such a fucking stalker.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.291
A stalker with presents.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.791
Damn, that's heavy.
I don't know how Santa does it.

11:53.791 --> 11:54.916
Well, probably opioids.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.458
Wait, wait, wait. Didn't we fire her?

11:56.458 --> 12:00.041
Yes, but I brought you
so many good memories,

12:00.041 --> 12:04.000
and it's all the good times
you had in this house with your parents.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.375
- Yeah, I don't wanna see that shit.
- Yes, you do.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.958
I promise, it'll make you feel better.

12:08.958 --> 12:11.541
From when you were six. Remember?

12:11.541 --> 12:13.875
- That's strange.
- Oh God. Mom.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.208
It says here, you're one inch tall.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.458
That can't be right.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.666
What? Did you steal these
from the Memory Bank?

12:19.666 --> 12:21.875
Yeah, and look. It's working.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.166
Measure me again!

12:23.166 --> 12:25.041
She was such a good mom.

12:25.041 --> 12:27.500
But you were such a bad daughter.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.541
- Oh my God!
- You weren't there for Mom

12:29.541 --> 12:30.791
when she needed you most.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.083
Sarah? She's not real. Just ignore her.

12:33.083 --> 12:36.250
Ooh, I swear it wasn't like that
in the Memory Bank.

12:36.250 --> 12:40.083
But, uh-- But don't worry.
I've got other great ones. Here.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.541
Aww. So cute. You used to play salon.

12:43.541 --> 12:46.416
But she lost all
of her hair from the chemotherapy.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.541
- Oh boy.
- Emmy, enough!

12:48.541 --> 12:49.833
Wait, no.

12:49.833 --> 12:53.458
What about your 11th birthday?
That was definitely awesome, right?

12:53.458 --> 12:55.208
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

12:55.208 --> 12:56.750
Oh my gosh. A wand.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.583
Give it a try, kiddo.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.916
Ooh!

12:59.916 --> 13:02.041
You cast a love spell.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.208
Mm.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.416
Ew! No kissing on my birthday.

13:05.416 --> 13:08.875
- Phew! Finally, a good one.
- He loved her so much, Sarah.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.916
- He did love her.
- All right, let's get outta here, before--

13:11.916 --> 13:14.041
- You abandoned him too.
- Stop it!

13:14.041 --> 13:15.791
You left him with no wife and no daughter.

13:15.791 --> 13:16.708
Shut up!

13:16.708 --> 13:19.083
And it pains me to say this
about a fellow woman,

13:19.083 --> 13:20.458
but you're a selfish cunt.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.750
- Whoa!
- Stop it!

13:21.750 --> 13:24.875
This is why I didn't wanna come here.
I can't do this.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.000
- Cool fucking memory bag, Emmy.
- I'm sorry.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.916
Sarah? Sarah, it's okay.

13:29.916 --> 13:31.708
No, you shut up too.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.791
Just leave me alone.
All of you, leave me alone.

13:34.791 --> 13:37.541
- Happy now, Emmy?
- Obviously not, Van.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.166
Fuck.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.500
Oh, there it is.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.958
That's where I dipped
my nuts in the wet cement.

13:42.958 --> 13:46.750
Ooh, look at that.
"Maury's balls were here."

13:46.750 --> 13:49.833
And I wrote that
with the tip of my young penis.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.791
Got cement in the hole.
Got very infected.

13:51.791 --> 13:56.375
Oh, Maury, isn't it sad that Montel
doesn't wanna follow in your nut-steps?

13:56.375 --> 14:00.541
This place did make me
the monster I am today.

14:00.541 --> 14:02.708
Cracked me right the fuck open.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.166
See? That's all I want for Montel.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.458
For some hot stud
to crack them wide open.

14:08.458 --> 14:12.000
Well, guess what?
You can consider me cracked.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.250
Oh, Montel. You had random sex?

14:14.250 --> 14:16.708
I sure did. But now I'm torn.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.833
The D was that big, huh?

14:18.833 --> 14:21.291
No. I mean about my future.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.666
I thought Notre Shame
was my absolute dream school,

14:24.666 --> 14:27.208
but maybe you guys are right.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.458
Maybe learning <i>is</i> stupid.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.833
- That's all we've been saying.
- I can't even read.

14:31.833 --> 14:35.541
The only book I care about
is the American flag.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.458
Oh.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.375
And if someone burns it,
I'll fucking kill them.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.000
<i>I don't give a damn if you fire me.</i>

14:41.000 --> 14:42.708
I'm confused by Bosch.

14:42.708 --> 14:46.083
The chief told him to leave the case alone
but that's not what he's doing.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.708
Oh, he's doing the opposite. Yeah.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.625
Uh, Bosch is very passionate
about his job.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.625
Walter, I fucked up! I fucked up bad!

14:54.625 --> 14:56.833
Emmy, what are you doing here?

14:56.833 --> 14:59.333
I had this whole plan to fix Sarah,

14:59.333 --> 15:03.166
but it all went sideways,
and now she's shut everybody out.

15:03.166 --> 15:07.041
Yes, very on-brand for her.
And Paul is done with that bullshit.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.166
Come on, Walter!
What about all your love lessons?

15:10.166 --> 15:13.250
You're the one who taught me
love means showing up.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.708
- It's too late, Emmy.
- No, you can't give up on this case.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.958
<i>I'm not giving up on this case.</i>

15:18.958 --> 15:22.000
- You tell 'em, Bosch.
- Oh my God!

15:22.000 --> 15:23.833
That is such a sign.

15:23.833 --> 15:27.000
- Please, please don't give up on Sarah.
- Uh, Emmy, I don't--

15:27.000 --> 15:31.166
I know she's been a pain in the ass,
but she's hurting bad, man.

15:31.166 --> 15:35.541
And you know, and I know,
even that grumpy cop on the TV knows,

15:35.541 --> 15:37.750
that Paul loves her unconditionally,

15:37.750 --> 15:42.625
and goddamn it, he's her father,
so get his ass up there!

15:43.583 --> 15:45.875
- Okay.
- Wait. My speech worked?

15:45.875 --> 15:48.125
It was a very good speech, Emmy.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.375
I'm so proud of how you've grown.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.291
Aww.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.958
Paul, honey,
could you please turn off the TV?

15:53.958 --> 15:56.541
What? But <i>Bosch</i> is... Why?

15:56.541 --> 15:59.541
Hear that? Upstairs?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.750
Sarah needs you.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.625
But... she keeps saying she doesn't.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.208
She's just scared.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.291
That's why you've gotta go
up there and fight for her.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.666
Really? But--

16:09.666 --> 16:11.875
- Trust me, boo.
- Okay.

16:11.875 --> 16:15.875
You know, Bosch also has a complicated
relationship with his daughter.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.291
Of course I don't know that, Paul.
What the fuc-- Girl.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.958
- Hey, sweet pea.
- Go away.

16:22.958 --> 16:26.291
- Walter?
- No giving up. Be like Bosch.

16:27.375 --> 16:31.583
I know you don't wanna talk to me,
and that's, um, totally okay.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.208
Don't listen to him, Sarah!

16:33.208 --> 16:35.208
Hey, Van. Back off.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.875
I fucked up, I know,
but you fucked up too,

16:37.875 --> 16:40.125
so let's give Paul a shot.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.708
But maybe...
maybe you could help me with something?

16:43.708 --> 16:47.458
I... I can't figure out
who the murderer is on <i>Bosch,</i>

16:47.458 --> 16:51.041
and-- and you've got
such a good brain for that stuff.

16:51.041 --> 16:54.583
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I think he's calming her down.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.291
He could always do that.

16:56.291 --> 17:00.625
So, the main suspect
is the owner of the apartment complex.

17:00.625 --> 17:03.458
He's played by that guy
your mom just loved.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.458
Oh, shoot, what's his name?

17:05.458 --> 17:08.625
He has, like, uh...
You know, a wide smile.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.375
- What else is he in?
- She's talking!

17:12.375 --> 17:14.208
Um, that submarine movie.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.750
Something with a...
With a month.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.666
Um...

17:17.666 --> 17:19.666
<i>The November to Remember--</i>

17:19.666 --> 17:22.083
Dad, are you talking about
<i>Hunt for Red October?</i>

17:22.083 --> 17:24.458
Yes! Yes, that's my girl.

17:24.458 --> 17:28.375
Yeah. Yeah, I... I was close.

17:28.375 --> 17:33.291
So, uh,
what's... going on with you, sweetie?

17:34.208 --> 17:35.416
You must hate me.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.375
What? I don't hate you.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.500
Wh-- Is that why you're crying?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.375
It's this whole house.

17:41.375 --> 17:44.333
- Seeing you. All of Mom's stuff.
- I know.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.958
And I-- And I wasn't there.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.166
I was just so scared
to see her and make it real, but then--

17:50.166 --> 17:51.625
Shh, shh.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.458
It's okay. It's okay.

17:53.458 --> 17:56.208
I can't believe
I didn't get to say goodbye.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.291
And, fuck, then you had
to go through all of this on your own.

18:00.291 --> 18:01.791
Hey, come on.

18:01.791 --> 18:03.666
I can't be in this house, Dad.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.541
It just reminds me how I broke everything.

18:06.541 --> 18:11.041
There's nothing you could do
to ever break this, honey,

18:11.041 --> 18:13.791
because you're all I've got.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.333
You really don't hate me?

18:16.333 --> 18:17.750
Hate you?

18:17.750 --> 18:21.416
Sarah, I have so much love for you.

18:21.416 --> 18:23.083
It's all I think about.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.583
It overwhelms me.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.458
And sometimes,
I can't even get the words out.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.875
That... That doesn't make sense.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.458
Why would he just... let her off the hook
after everything she did?

18:33.458 --> 18:36.166
Hey, logic has its limits.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.583
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, kiddo.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.375
Aww.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.791
Look at her.

18:46.791 --> 18:50.416
I only wanted to keep
Sarah from feeling pain, but...

18:50.416 --> 18:53.416
...I didn't realize how much joy
I was keeping out too.

18:53.416 --> 18:56.833
- Oh my. Are those tears I see?
- No.

18:56.833 --> 19:01.083
Come on, Van. Get in here
before you bust a fucking duct.

19:01.083 --> 19:04.375
Let's go, Walter. You too.

19:04.375 --> 19:07.291
I really don't like to be hugged.

19:07.916 --> 19:10.125
And that's why, Madam Peen,

19:10.125 --> 19:12.958
I think I'd be a real asset
to your university.

19:12.958 --> 19:14.958
And of course,
they're a legacy,

19:14.958 --> 19:17.083
so we all know how this is gonna go.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.916
Well, Montel's transcript
is very impressive, but...

19:20.916 --> 19:22.541
...there's no semen on it.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.625
Are you passionate
about sexual intercourse, Montel?

19:25.625 --> 19:29.291
Tell her about this afternoon.
How you fucked that rando?

19:29.291 --> 19:32.208
Oh, I did. I went to hump town
with a virtual stranger.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.333
Mm, I see. And was it hot?

19:34.333 --> 19:37.250
Oh, yes! [giggles] It was wild.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.708
And kinda silly.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.333
I'm sorry. The sex was "silly"?

19:41.333 --> 19:44.250
Yeah! I mean, the sounds are absurd.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.250
- Montel...
- And the parts are ridiculous!

19:47.250 --> 19:48.666
Eh... What are you doing?

19:48.666 --> 19:52.041
What? His penis was bizarre!

19:52.041 --> 19:53.916
It was a dogleg left.

19:53.916 --> 19:57.416
And, guys, when he came,
he dabbed and said, "We out here cummin'"

19:57.416 --> 20:00.750
Young monster,
are you sex-shaming your partner?

20:00.750 --> 20:02.916
What? No! Uh...

20:02.916 --> 20:05.208
Maybe, uh... I'm just being myself.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.291
Well, there's no room
for shaming of any kind at Fuck U.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.583
So, if you plan on ejaculating here,

20:10.583 --> 20:13.791
you're gonna need to get rid of that cloak
and change your attitude.

20:13.791 --> 20:16.083
Leave shame behind?

20:16.083 --> 20:20.250
Well, I-- I guess I could change
my whole personality to fit in here.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.833
Oh, no, you will not!

20:21.833 --> 20:25.375
You were perfect the moment
you shot out of your father's anus,

20:25.375 --> 20:29.750
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
this stupid Peen tell you otherwise.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.083
And that means something
coming from your mother

20:32.083 --> 20:33.916
because she didn't even want you.

20:33.916 --> 20:34.875
You're right!

20:34.875 --> 20:37.791
Madam Peen, I am a bad bitch,

20:37.791 --> 20:40.125
and I'm gonna do great things,

20:40.125 --> 20:42.916
but not here at this dumb-fuck school.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.708
I'm going to Notre Shame.

20:45.708 --> 20:49.208
Damn right! Fuck you and fuck Fuck U.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.250
That's right, Madam.

20:50.250 --> 20:54.833
You can kiss my 15-dollar-a-year
alumni donation goodbye.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.208
- Storm out!
- Storming.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.041
Oh my gosh.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.750
I forgot Mom used to buy us
matching outfits.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.291
Well, you insisted.

21:04.291 --> 21:05.666
More, more!

21:05.666 --> 21:07.375
Oh God.

21:07.375 --> 21:11.208
Remember when Mom stayed up all night
to help me finish that science project?

21:11.208 --> 21:15.708
And sweet Paul was so mad the teacher
gave his wife a B-minus.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.333
Actually, it was a B-plus,

21:18.333 --> 21:21.750
and Paul was pissed that the teacher
had called the project "inelegant."

21:21.750 --> 21:24.083
Your mother loved you so much.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.375
She did more of your homework
than you did.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.916
Aw.

21:29.916 --> 21:33.958
Oh God, Dad. I miss her so much.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.125
I can't-- I can't do this. I can't.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.791
Oh, Sarah.

21:38.791 --> 21:39.916
It comes in waves.

21:39.916 --> 21:42.916
I-- I thought-- I thought I was okay,
and then, suddenly--

21:42.916 --> 21:45.291
I know. Suddenly it hits you.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.375
- She's gone.
- Yeah.

21:49.458 --> 21:53.041
There you go. Let it all out.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.125
Who are you?

21:54.125 --> 21:57.583
Oh, this is my good friend,
Keith from Grief.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.041
It is so nice to meet you, Sarah.

22:00.041 --> 22:03.375
Yeah, he really helped me
through some scary times, honey.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.666
And I think he can help you too.

22:05.666 --> 22:08.500
Your dad has told me a lot
about your mother,

22:08.500 --> 22:10.833
and I am so sorry about your loss.

22:10.833 --> 22:12.750
I don't want it to hurt anymore.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.083
The only way out is through.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.041
Are you listening to this A student?

22:17.041 --> 22:20.000
Sarah, your dad is a mensch.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.416
He sure is.

22:22.416 --> 22:23.541
Mm.

22:23.541 --> 22:24.625
Mm.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.375
Oh, this is cozy.

22:31.875 --> 22:35.041
- What kind of soap do you use, Sarah?
- Uh, the cheapest kind?

22:35.041 --> 22:37.875
Well, it smells great.
I hope it rubs off on the wool.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.333
I'm happy you guys are all with me.

22:41.333 --> 22:44.583
- This is way nicer.
- Yeah, it is.

22:44.583 --> 22:47.208
I don't wanna jinx it,
but everything's really turning around--

22:48.291 --> 22:50.208
That fucking asshole!

22:50.208 --> 22:51.666
I was merging!

22:51.666 --> 22:53.333
Wait. I know that car.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.833
Is that asshole--

22:54.833 --> 22:57.375
Ben! Ben, the urinal guy!

22:57.375 --> 22:58.791
Go! Get him!

22:59.750 --> 23:02.041
Oh-my-God.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.625
What are the odds, right?

23:03.625 --> 23:07.083
Well, I'd say the universe
wants us to hang out again,

23:07.083 --> 23:10.083
or you hired this guy
to follow me and kill me, maybe?

23:10.083 --> 23:12.041
That does sound like something I'd do.

23:12.041 --> 23:15.583
Come on. A third meet-cute?
It's a threet-cute.

23:15.583 --> 23:19.625
This is the end of the rom-com,
where the hero lady gets banged out

23:19.625 --> 23:23.041
on the side of the highway
inside a smoking hot car.

23:23.041 --> 23:25.208
What rom-coms are you watching?

23:25.208 --> 23:28.375
I mean, this is kinda perfect, Van.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.541
I don't know.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.041
With all the grief stuff
you've been avoiding...

23:32.041 --> 23:34.958
But it's not up to me.
Emmy's leading the team now.

23:34.958 --> 23:38.291
- I am?
- Well, Emmy, what do you think?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.250
Van's right.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.958
- You should probably hang with Keith.
- Sorry, bubala.

23:42.958 --> 23:46.791
Before you go back to dipping
Ben's pen in the company stink.

23:46.791 --> 23:47.750
Um, I--

23:47.750 --> 23:52.083
I just wanna say, I'm...
I'm sorry I was such a jerk before.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.750
I... [sighs] I was dealing with some shit.

23:55.666 --> 23:58.083
I still am.
But, uh, it wasn't fair to you.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.750
Yeah. I'll have you know,
my sisters say I'm a real catch.

24:01.750 --> 24:06.166
I'd love to have another shot,
but, like, maybe in three months?

24:06.166 --> 24:09.708
Well, as long as this guy
doesn't kill me before then, I'm in.

24:10.916 --> 24:14.125
Yes, yes, I shall let them know, Mummy.

24:14.125 --> 24:18.666
Oh! And since I have you, perhaps
you and I should grab dinner next week?

24:18.666 --> 24:20.000
Uh, hello?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.291
Uh, Mummy? You still there?

24:22.291 --> 24:24.625
So, what did Rita say?

24:24.625 --> 24:28.166
Well, first, she said she'd love
to have dinner with me.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.791
A very long one actually, very soon. Yes.

24:30.791 --> 24:34.958
But more importantly, she's elated
you chose to attend Notre Shame next year.

24:34.958 --> 24:38.958
It's the perfect fit for me.
I would not last a day at FU.

24:38.958 --> 24:42.166
I'm too smart to waste my life on bad sex.

24:42.166 --> 24:45.708
Oh well, we do have bad sex
at Notre Shame too.

24:45.708 --> 24:48.583
Oh! Maybe while I'm there,
I'll fuck your mom real bad.

24:48.583 --> 24:51.916
Yes, then we'll both have fucked
each other's parents.

24:51.916 --> 24:56.666
And then, maybe we mix it up
and fuck our own parents?

24:56.666 --> 24:58.375
- I'm not into that.
- Yeah, well.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.541
Wait till Notre Shame
gets through with you.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.958
Yo! Morning treat.
Pop-Tarts and java.

25:04.958 --> 25:08.166
I figured out the Pop-Tart fits
if you break 'em in half.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.125
- Hey. Walk with me?
- Wait. What are you doing?

25:11.041 --> 25:13.083
The Sarah stuff was a wake-up call.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.750
I've been avoiding my own shit
for a long time.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, I... I kinda noticed.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.541
So, I'm gonna take some time
to sort myself out.

25:21.541 --> 25:23.875
Oh, man, that is so healthy.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.500
But also, I'm really gonna miss

25:26.500 --> 25:29.666
working with someone
who turns me on so fucking much.

25:29.666 --> 25:30.833
I know you will.

25:30.833 --> 25:36.041
Hey, I'll be thinking about you
when I'm in the tub or sleeping on a bus.

25:36.958 --> 25:38.875
Sarah's lucky to have you, Emmy.

25:38.875 --> 25:42.875
You really are... oddly compelling.

25:43.916 --> 25:47.000
Damn. What a hot fucking exit.

25:47.000 --> 25:47.958
