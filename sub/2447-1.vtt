WEBVTT

00:30.792 --> 00:34.335
Ten minutes to curtain. Ten minutes.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.506
All the world...
all the world is a stage.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.209
And all the men and women...

00:41.309 --> 00:43.923
merely players.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.982
They have exits.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.985
And they have their entrances.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.454
And they have their exits.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.388
And they have their entrances.

00:58.525 --> 01:02.561
And one man in his time
plays many parts.

01:05.230 --> 01:10.802
His acts being seven ages.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.574
Do you believe that?

01:19.145 --> 01:22.516
Was that real for you?

01:22.616 --> 01:24.094
No, be honest.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.253
Was it honest?

01:33.126 --> 01:36.497
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.633
No, it wasn't.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.970
It wasn't honest?

01:43.070 --> 01:45.841
Well, what was it then?

01:46.941 --> 01:50.444
No, not very good, no.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.546
I don't believe it.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.348
Should I try it again?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.651
The world is a stage

01:56.951 --> 01:59.654
and all men and women merely players.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.357
How about that? Any better?

02:03.457 --> 02:07.228
They have their exits
and their entrances.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.399
Were you affecting it
or were you really saying it?

02:11.499 --> 02:15.703
And one, a man in his life

02:16.003 --> 02:18.706
plays many parts.

02:19.006 --> 02:24.312
Did that mean anything to you or anyone
that ever existed in the world?

02:24.912 --> 02:27.582
Are you fooling yourself?

02:28.206 --> 02:32.687
Were you not committing
to your own instincts?

02:32.987 --> 02:35.990
What are you supposed to do?
Jump up and down?

02:36.090 --> 02:38.526
You know, do a jig?

02:38.826 --> 02:42.064
Just say your words.
Shakespeare will do the rest.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.298
- You know that.
- Five minutes.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.969
Five minutes. Five minutes.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.604
My face of masks.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.107
My tragedy and my comedy.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.943
Let's put these together tonight, buddy.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.712
I love you both.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.214
Seven ages.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.316
There are seven ages.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.015
First...

03:05.852 --> 03:07.789
his acts being seven ages.

03:07.989 --> 03:11.693
Then the... the whining school boy.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.126
And the whining...

03:15.929 --> 03:18.637
Sighing like an, oh, sighing...

03:18.737 --> 03:20.577
like a furnace.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.870
What is a man? No, that's Hamlet.

03:30.643 --> 03:31.710
Hello?

03:39.051 --> 03:40.461
Oh, no.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.370
- Open! Oh!
- Yeah?

03:44.470 --> 03:46.527
Thank God.
I just was... I was just in here.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.663
- I was... I got locked out.
- I didn't see you come out.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.999
- I'm Simon Axler.
- No, you're not.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.267
I'm Simon Axler.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.503
- I have the dressing room upstairs.
- Do you need a dollar or something?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.369
I'm in the play!

04:08.481 --> 04:10.418
- I got to be on stage.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.453
- You got to let me through.
- No, no, no.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.856
I'm in there.
I'm supposed to be on stage.

04:14.956 --> 04:16.824
The play has already started.
You're going to have to...

04:16.923 --> 04:19.125
- I'm in the play!
- Keep your voice down.

04:19.226 --> 04:22.530
I'm Simon Axler. I'm on the marquee.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.200
I'm in the lobby. The picture...
like this. Dressed like this.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.036
I'm in the show.
Why would I be dressed like this?

04:29.136 --> 04:32.239
- Please.
- No, no, no. Outside.

04:32.839 --> 04:36.243
I'm Simon Axler. I'm Simon Axler.
I'm in the play.

04:36.343 --> 04:37.745
All men... all men...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.947
And all women... are players.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.550
All men... they're... they are players.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.716
They... they... they have...

04:45.659 --> 04:48.022
I'm Simon Axler. I'm on the marquee.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.790
I play the lead.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.227
I'm Simon Axler. I'm Simon Axler.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.428
Three minutes.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.501
Did I miss my cue?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.904
I missed my cue.

05:03.004 --> 05:06.207
There is not one so young
and so villainous this day living.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.876
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.945
I'll give him his payment.
God take your worship.

05:12.573 --> 05:15.850
- 30 seconds.
- I hope I shall see an end of him.

05:15.950 --> 05:18.786
For my soul, yet I know not why,

05:18.886 --> 05:21.055
hates nothing more...

05:21.455 --> 05:24.423
The last scene of all...

05:27.393 --> 05:31.465
that ends this...

05:31.565 --> 05:36.735
strange eventful history...

05:38.138 --> 05:40.031
is...

05:40.777 --> 05:43.401
second childishness...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.406
and mere...

05:49.284 --> 05:51.140
oblivion...

05:52.052 --> 05:55.053
sans teeth...

05:56.022 --> 05:59.114
sans eyes...

06:01.628 --> 06:03.580
sans...

06:04.480 --> 06:06.316
taste...

06:08.568 --> 06:10.935
sans everything.

06:30.257 --> 06:34.895
The famous pianist, sometimes actor,
and brilliant raconteur

06:34.995 --> 06:37.665
Oscar Levant once said,

06:37.765 --> 06:42.203
"There is a thin line
between genius and insanity."

06:42.303 --> 06:44.347
And he had erased that line.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.312
In a few minutes,
we'll get you something for the pain.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.181
Did you believe that,
that moan I just did,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.451
about my pain? Did you believe that?

06:57.651 --> 06:58.753
I did.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.189
I didn't. Can I try that again?

07:02.289 --> 07:05.410
I think it can be a little more subtle.
Ready?

07:11.074 --> 07:14.201
No, that's too much.
I can bring it down a little bit.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.903
As an actor...

07:16.503 --> 07:19.240
I've come the realization that...

07:19.340 --> 07:23.366
I'm having trouble separating
a scene from a play

07:24.445 --> 07:26.580
with the realities in real life.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.616
I was out one day. I was out, I think.

07:29.716 --> 07:33.020
Did you believe that, what I just did?
What I just said?

07:33.320 --> 07:34.622
I thought I did that one.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.490
Let me say it as clearly as possible.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.695
I will never go on stage again.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.026
I love this house.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.132
14 years, it...

08:51.232 --> 08:53.109
still...

08:53.801 --> 08:55.934
looks like you haven't moved in.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.881
Oh, you...

09:08.281 --> 09:10.384
you'll get some rest.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.519
Please don't say that.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.422
I don't sleep. You know that.

09:16.066 --> 09:18.359
I don't sleep.

09:18.459 --> 09:21.695
So you don't have to say,
"Get some sleep."

09:22.293 --> 09:23.775
Well...

09:24.478 --> 09:26.432
you know...

09:26.532 --> 09:28.402
you'll call me...

09:28.502 --> 09:31.169
if you... if you get any bad ideas.

09:45.186 --> 09:47.921
Well, when I got home
after the accident,

09:48.021 --> 09:50.457
at the theater, I never...

09:50.557 --> 09:52.593
I couldn't remember what happened.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.996
Then I realized that
16 days had gone by.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.661
I don't recollect anything
that happened in those days.

10:00.334 --> 10:03.050
And did that scare you?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.874
No, it didn't.

10:07.974 --> 10:12.112
At the time, but now,
I don't know when I think about it.

10:12.892 --> 10:16.014
It's concerning.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.629
You know, I didn't have friends, really.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.432
I didn't have people I could...

10:31.932 --> 10:33.932
I could talk to.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.805
No family, of course.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.441
Maybe... I don't know how that happened.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.676
No children.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.022
No wife.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.323
I always wondered why I had a shotgun.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.759
And it that moment, I realized it.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.664
It was because of Hemingway.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.465
Hemingway blew his
brain's out with a shotgun.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.591
That had to be the only reason I had it.

11:07.691 --> 11:10.168
Because I'm not a gun person.

11:14.874 --> 11:17.709
Hemingway must have had longer arms.

11:25.050 --> 11:29.623
Jerry. Sorry to call you this late.
It's Simon.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.490
I think I'm in some kind of trouble.

11:34.102 --> 11:34.961
Yeah.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.861
And that's how we met.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.875
We're going to keep you pretty
busy here over the next 30 days.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.983
I like busy.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.959
Do I have a room?

11:52.059 --> 11:55.048
- Yes, you've got a nice room.
- Is it a single room? Am I alone?

11:55.248 --> 11:59.486
- It will be a double room for the first week.
- A double room? Oh, I don't know about that.

11:59.686 --> 12:02.022
But look, I'm famous, you know?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.525
And I'm sorry, I know,
maybe you don't know who I am,

12:04.625 --> 12:07.058
but I'm famous. And I...

12:20.673 --> 12:23.811
You got to not do that, doc,
because that just is upsetting to me.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.313
- Not do what?
- Write when I talk.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.919
It's like, you're doing a play,

12:28.019 --> 12:30.417
and all of a sudden the audience
is writing in the program.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.366
That's why I hate opening nights
because the fucking critics go in there,

12:33.466 --> 12:36.023
and they're writing,
they're writing in their pads,

12:36.123 --> 12:39.893
- and writing everywhere and you see them.
- You don't like it when people write things?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.960
Yeah, well, it bothers me.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.904
Hello, Oliver.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.740
- How are you doing?
- What are you doing?

12:52.940 --> 12:55.642
- Oh, these will help you sleep.
- No, no, that doesn't work.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.576
No, trust me. These are different.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.586
Acting is what I do.
It always came easy to me.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.889
I never had a problem with it.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.291
You know, it was just like...

13:11.391 --> 13:14.127
They say, "To the men are born."

13:14.227 --> 13:18.298
I was born with it. I love the stage.
I love being on the stage.

13:18.398 --> 13:23.561
I was always, like, myself.
You know, and I was very...

13:24.404 --> 13:27.340
natural, you know.
It was like home, being on the stage.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.744
The fall was a gradual one.

13:31.044 --> 13:35.349
I think it really started
when I lost track of...

13:35.449 --> 13:39.950
what I... what I would
call my... my craft.

13:44.056 --> 13:47.925
There are a lot of things, you know,
you can deal with, but your craft,

13:48.025 --> 13:51.298
I mean, it's sort of like a musician

13:51.398 --> 13:54.401
losing his ability to...

13:54.801 --> 13:57.070
to play the keys.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.507
I know it's happened to great
musicians before, but...

14:00.607 --> 14:02.743
how about losing your ear?

14:02.843 --> 14:06.079
And I don't mean like Beethoven,
I mean, like...

14:06.179 --> 14:09.082
that's what I felt about losing...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.950
my... my gift...

14:12.985 --> 14:14.953
my talent.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.156
It just started to recede.

14:21.256 --> 14:25.298
Mainly the desire, I think.

14:25.398 --> 14:29.300
The appetite to do it started to...

14:31.971 --> 14:34.975
fade, or... I don't know.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.744
I lost track of it.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.714
Anyway, you know, you...

14:41.114 --> 14:44.264
you're not prepared for that
kind of thing. It sort of...

14:44.364 --> 14:46.290
the writing's on the wall
for other things,

14:46.390 --> 14:49.489
like you're going to lose your friends.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.892
You know, what do they
say about athletes?

14:51.992 --> 14:54.461
First their legs go,

14:54.561 --> 14:58.932
their knees, then their money goes,
then their friends go.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.735
So, you know that stuff, but...

15:01.835 --> 15:04.471
the inability to...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.335
remember words...

15:08.841 --> 15:10.841
How did that happen?

15:13.145 --> 15:16.083
I mean, I actually would be in a play,

15:16.483 --> 15:18.785
just the other day...

15:19.185 --> 15:20.832
and I...

15:23.122 --> 15:27.260
I would be saying lines
from a play I did ten years ago,

15:27.360 --> 15:31.329
which was a totally different play.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.735
And of course,

15:34.835 --> 15:37.601
that's really unsettling.

15:38.805 --> 15:42.476
The audiences start to... to...

15:42.676 --> 15:46.548
I'm not alone here.
You're listening to what I'm saying.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.717
Does this interest you in any way?

15:50.817 --> 15:54.521
So I can go on? I feel like I'm...

15:54.721 --> 15:57.168
hogging everything here.

15:58.057 --> 16:02.195
I don't know what else I can say
except that it got really bad,

16:02.495 --> 16:04.464
worse and worse.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.398
When... when the audiences started...

16:15.474 --> 16:17.878
When the audiences started to, you know,

16:17.978 --> 16:21.012
recede and not want to...

16:23.716 --> 16:27.484
participate with me... anymore.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.224
Sensing what was happening...

16:31.324 --> 16:34.394
it was just too much to take. I...

16:34.494 --> 16:36.221
I just didn't...

16:38.931 --> 16:43.236
I lost something that I had all my life.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.772
It was gone.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.688
Like, just gone, like magic.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.792
And I...

16:54.614 --> 16:58.419
I couldn't have even conceived of
something like that happening, so...

16:58.919 --> 17:02.015
what to do? What to do?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.425
Would you mind cleaning the tables?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.961
Yes. Okay.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.030
First, leave me my drink.
What is wrong with you?

17:11.130 --> 17:13.032
This is no good, you see.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.069
Excuse me sir,
we're doing a survey on reactions.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.318
- Would you like to take part?
- Yeah, sure.

17:18.417 --> 17:21.107
Thank you. That's two points.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.542
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.612
- No, never.
- Thank you very much.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.545
Do you like it?

17:28.582 --> 17:30.751
That's another two points.

17:31.851 --> 17:36.323
Simon, would you be free
later today for a chat?

17:36.923 --> 17:39.392
Oh, I have other plans.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.631
You know, I might be able
to fit you in next Thursday.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.564
Thursday.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.503
I was just joking.

17:50.703 --> 17:54.808
I was only joking. Of course I'll
be able to have a chat with you.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.110
That was so convincing.

17:57.710 --> 18:02.015
I was the perfect wife
for the perfect 20th century,

18:02.115 --> 18:07.554
East Coast, Ivy-league educated,
well-respected, wealthy husband.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.223
Our house was just outside the city.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.994
And it was the perfect place for us
to celebrate our perfect lives.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.230
And we have two...

18:17.530 --> 18:19.747
perfect children.

18:19.847 --> 18:23.169
We have a five-year-old boy
and a seven-year-old girl

18:23.269 --> 18:26.773
to fit into our perfect lives.
Then one afternoon,

18:26.873 --> 18:31.177
I went into the city to do some shopping
and halfway there I realized

18:31.277 --> 18:34.314
that I had left my wallet
back at the house,

18:34.414 --> 18:36.249
and so I drove back home.

18:36.349 --> 18:40.086
I could only see the top
of my little girl's head

18:40.186 --> 18:44.491
from the back of the sofa
and the TV was on

18:44.691 --> 18:46.893
and the Saturday cartoons were playing,

18:46.993 --> 18:49.696
but that's what she would have been
watching under any circumstances.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.967
- I'm sorry, are you following me?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

18:54.067 --> 18:58.853
So everything was in order
except I had to wonder why

18:58.953 --> 19:02.909
the little cotton underpants
were lying on the arm of the couch.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.301
Now you probably see
where I'm going with this, but...

19:06.029 --> 19:09.749
when I got to the back of the couch
and I looked over,

19:09.849 --> 19:15.228
I was... I was not prepared to see my
rich and powerful husband's head

19:15.328 --> 19:18.692
out of sight and under
my little girl's skirt.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.195
You know, it's a terrible
thing to say, I know,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.821
but while she's talking,
all I'm thinking about is

19:25.921 --> 19:27.801
maybe this is some kind
of test, you know,

19:27.901 --> 19:33.525
like they're testing me
to see if I buy this stuff.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.060
Is this going to make me better?

19:36.160 --> 19:40.313
I mean, is this part of the therapy?

19:40.792 --> 19:44.384
You know...
the sick talking to the sicker.

19:44.924 --> 19:47.387
And I made some kind of noise,

19:47.487 --> 19:50.620
and my husband's head appeared from...

19:52.491 --> 19:54.461
from... from where it had been,

19:54.561 --> 19:58.498
and... and he looked at me, and he says,

19:58.698 --> 20:01.001
"Oh, hi.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.270
Aren't you off to the city?"

20:04.770 --> 20:08.905
And I stood there frozen,

20:09.409 --> 20:13.110
my heart turning over,
and my throat burning...

20:15.581 --> 20:18.071
and I had nothing to say.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.988
Nothing.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.798
There she is pouring her heart out

20:25.225 --> 20:30.263
and all I can do is think about
how she's doing it.

20:30.819 --> 20:33.466
I mean, how she's performing it.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.535
I don't know, I would have...
I would have...

20:35.735 --> 20:38.138
been a little bit more
emotional at this point,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.173
I had to remove myself.
You know what I'm saying?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.770
And I'm...

20:41.870 --> 20:45.643
watching her like I'm watching
a Tennessee Williams play.

20:49.281 --> 20:53.539
I need someone to kill my husband.

20:55.288 --> 21:00.047
Did you ask if she was ever
under psychiatric care before?

21:01.227 --> 21:03.932
- No.
- Weren't you curious?

21:05.531 --> 21:08.635
Well, to be honest,
it never entered my mind.

21:08.735 --> 21:12.238
I'm sure you can find... you'll be
able to find somebody that can do that.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.413
Well, you.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.213
If I was a killer,
I would tell you this.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.642
I'd do it pro bono.

21:22.742 --> 21:24.818
I'd do it, but, you know,

21:24.918 --> 21:27.620
I'm an out-of-work actor.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.891
I'd botch the job, I'm sure.

21:31.191 --> 21:33.658
So, you know...

21:37.362 --> 21:40.366
Are you serious? Are you serious?

21:40.466 --> 21:44.152
Yeah. I mean,
of course I'm willing to pay.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.974
Oh, no. Sybil, Sybil, listen.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.600
When you do a play,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.181
do you ever ask about
the character's background, past?

21:54.881 --> 21:58.551
- Of course, yeah.
- But not in real life?

21:58.851 --> 22:04.023
I saw you in that film about the man
who slaughters all his neighbors.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.126
Yeah, murders the neighbor next door.

22:06.226 --> 22:08.394
Yeah. You were so convincing.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.697
That was a fiction, Sybil. Fiction.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.267
You can't just go around asking people

22:14.367 --> 22:18.405
if they'd kill your husband for you.
It's not done.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.573
It's socially...

22:20.773 --> 22:23.243
socially awkward.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.811
- You know?
- But you're not.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.647
You're not people, Simon.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.514
- What?
- You're my friend.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.453
Yum, yum, yummy.

22:37.656 --> 22:42.829
I lost my talent for no good reason
and now just as arbitrarily,

22:43.229 --> 22:47.133
I'm losing the desire to kill myself.
Or it's... I mean, I lost it.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.971
The most important thing is you're
leaving here a stronger man.

22:51.271 --> 22:55.141
And remember, we'll continue
our private sessions on Skype.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.277
Oh, yeah, Skype.
I got that in my head, you know.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.013
- Yeah. Good.
- All the instructions in my head.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.549
Well, you know, my big worry is that

23:03.049 --> 23:07.021
every time I see a camera,
I sort of, you know,

23:07.121 --> 23:09.790
I feel the need to perform.

23:10.190 --> 23:14.592
- It's a habit.
- Don't expect any applause. It's just us.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.962
- Hi.
- Hi. May I help you?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.082
You don't remember me?

23:43.322 --> 23:46.113
Oh, man, you're kidding.

23:46.213 --> 23:47.927
Little Pegeen.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.964
How are you? Come on in. Wow.

23:51.064 --> 23:53.366
It's a delivery from my parents.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.617
Oh, gee, thanks. Wow.

23:57.817 --> 24:03.533
God. I still have this image of you
sucking at your mother's breast.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.114
Pure class.

24:08.346 --> 24:09.313
Well...

24:11.183 --> 24:13.920
You know, when I was, like,
8 and you were, like, 40,

24:14.020 --> 24:16.255
I had a massive crush on you?

24:16.355 --> 24:18.844
- You did? Whoa.
- Big time.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.444
Well...

24:21.344 --> 24:22.944
- Look at you now.
- Yeah.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.347
Do I have something on my face
or do you always space out

24:40.447 --> 24:42.849
in the direction of people
you haven't seen in a while?

24:42.949 --> 24:47.288
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was staring, wasn't I?

24:48.288 --> 24:50.089
I was a little lost. I'm sorry.

24:50.189 --> 24:55.462
Simon Axler, whose presence in a room
is as dazzling as his presence on stage.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.900
Simon Axler,
with the charisma that kills.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.590
What happened? Did you get shot?

25:06.038 --> 25:08.108
What brings you here?

25:08.208 --> 25:11.444
I live near you now.
I teach at Westcott.

25:11.744 --> 25:15.148
You teach? At Westcott Women's College?

25:15.248 --> 25:16.683
- Yeah.
- There.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.124
Theater, acting, scenic design.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.690
- Family trade.
- Precisely.

25:24.090 --> 25:28.705
You know, your mother and I co-starred
when she played Pegeen Mike

25:29.005 --> 25:31.165
- at the Bramford Theater.
- Yes, I know.

25:31.265 --> 25:35.799
I've heard all of the stories.
Old theater friends. Long before my time.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.070
So...

25:42.107 --> 25:44.712
Do you remember
the last time you saw me?

25:46.412 --> 25:48.047
Yes.

25:48.147 --> 25:52.425
- You must have been 10, 11 years old.
- You remember what you gave me?

25:53.919 --> 25:58.188
I gave you the wedding ring
I wore in Streetcar.

26:00.359 --> 26:04.397
I slept with that wedding ring
under my pillow for...

26:04.497 --> 26:06.058
What?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.770
I thought that it meant
that you would marry me.

26:11.359 --> 26:14.707
But then a couple of decades
went by and you never showed up.

26:15.207 --> 26:18.242
Well, you all moved 3,000
miles away, you know.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.683
So, tell me, how are you parents doing?

26:23.783 --> 26:26.553
I don't know.
I mostly try to avoid them.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.521
Why?

26:28.621 --> 26:32.555
They don't approve
of who I'm living with.

26:33.324 --> 26:35.541
Oh, yeah?

26:35.728 --> 26:37.764
Who is he? What is he?

26:38.564 --> 26:40.030
It's a she.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.701
She? Whoa.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.251
Well, that's okay.

26:48.351 --> 26:49.342
Great.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.440
Shit.

26:52.545 --> 26:55.313
I got to take this shit. Sorry.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.084
Okay.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.841
Hello?

26:59.941 --> 27:05.473
Oh, hi, yeah. No, I just...
I stopped by his house and we talked.

27:05.573 --> 27:08.428
Yes, we're talking. We're talking.

27:08.528 --> 27:13.466
No, I just got back. It's a nice house.
It's a really nice house. Yeah.

27:13.566 --> 27:19.171
Because basically it's none of
your goddamn business, okay?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.907
Okay, I'll talk to you
when I talk to you.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.774
I'll talk to you when I
talk to you. Okay, bye.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.144
Oh, God.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.516
Everything all right?

27:30.616 --> 27:34.820
Yeah, it's just someone's freaking out
about casting for Tuesday.

27:35.833 --> 27:39.125
- This is Sunday.
- I know. They were just being annoying.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.494
- Yeah.
- Oh, you know, maybe you could help.

27:41.594 --> 27:44.130
We're doing a contemporary
adaptation of Macbeth

27:44.230 --> 27:45.832
- and I cannot think of another actor...
- No.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.954
I'd like to try it out on more than you.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.537
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

27:51.637 --> 27:52.964
I get anxious.

27:54.139 --> 27:57.944
And here I was thinking you were
getting back your killer charisma.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.080
- Oh, no.
- This is all very unlike you.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.248
- It is?
- Yeah.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.708
You know what's like me?

28:06.285 --> 28:09.019
Yeah, I'm starting to figure it out.

28:10.621 --> 28:11.491
Well...

28:11.591 --> 28:14.691
We should get this to
run all over the house.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.565
Want to stay for dinner?

28:19.665 --> 28:21.599
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.242
Oh, no.

28:49.996 --> 28:52.062
- It's okay.
- Oh, the waiter in me.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.118
- Have some.
- Wow.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.020
We're brilliant engineers

29:14.590 --> 29:18.556
and we didn't even have
to employ... abused labor.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.032
So, what happened with your acting?

29:26.432 --> 29:32.076
I don't know.
Just it's just too tedious to discuss.

29:32.176 --> 29:36.008
Well, did something happen
or did you retire?

29:36.108 --> 29:38.344
Would you...
please don't ask me about that.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.764
You know, I've been really...

29:41.864 --> 29:46.619
spending, like, 30 days
talking about nothing else, so...

29:46.719 --> 29:48.721
- Okay, well...
- ...if we could just, you know.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.798
What do you want to talk about?

29:51.824 --> 29:53.926
Well, there's the...

29:54.126 --> 29:55.959
the signing of...

30:06.638 --> 30:09.907
- I thought you slept with women.
- I do.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.562
What do you think of her?

30:13.946 --> 30:16.348
Well, she's my friend's daughter.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.349
And she's a lesbian.

30:21.252 --> 30:22.640
You never been with a man?

30:23.356 --> 30:25.524
Not in 16 years.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.160
Oh, well...

30:28.260 --> 30:32.598
I haven't been with
a lesbian in 67 years.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.946
That you know of.

30:36.202 --> 30:41.204
Flirtatious lesbian, I might add.
However that's possible.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.962
You...

30:46.078 --> 30:47.947
I don't know what to say.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.241
You're a... you're with a woman now?

30:51.951 --> 30:54.318
Yeah. Kind... Yeah, pretty much.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.393
Why do you... why do you say that?

31:01.193 --> 31:04.363
Well, she's a lesbian
and she's flirting with me.

31:04.763 --> 31:07.301
Doesn't bother you, the age difference?

31:08.701 --> 31:11.437
I have been thinking
about you inappropriately

31:11.537 --> 31:14.823
since it was really inappropriate.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.176
Well, you're the psychiatrist.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.310
How does that track with you?

31:55.714 --> 32:00.550
But who is this who lies so very awake?

32:02.887 --> 32:06.590
It was thus when I awoke.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.995
So, what shall we do with it, my lord?

32:13.532 --> 32:17.570
For now I would say...

32:17.970 --> 32:19.072
let it be.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.040
Enjoy what time it has left.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.725
Or perhaps...

32:28.748 --> 32:30.516
we could...

32:30.616 --> 32:33.319
just talk gentle to it

32:33.419 --> 32:34.987
or...

32:35.687 --> 32:36.972
maybe just keep it

32:37.990 --> 32:41.892
warm and safe.

33:24.602 --> 33:25.404
Yeah?

33:25.604 --> 33:29.341
Be forewarned, Mr. Famous.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.577
Pegeen is desirable,

33:31.677 --> 33:35.247
she's audacious,
and she's utterly ruthless.

33:35.347 --> 33:40.017
Utterly cold-hearted, incomparably
selfish, and completely amoral.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.702
Hello?

33:56.802 --> 34:01.774
Hi. I understand Louise has been
calling you and I have to apologize.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.543
Louise?

34:03.643 --> 34:06.212
Louise Trenner,
the dean of Westcott College.

34:07.012 --> 34:11.583
Oh, so that's what those
cryptic cell calls were about.

34:11.684 --> 34:14.620
Little creepy hang-ups coming
in the middle of the night

34:14.719 --> 34:17.817
waking me out of my deep slumber.

34:28.931 --> 34:30.737
- Hello?
- She will drain you.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.806
- She will diminish your mental capacity to think.
- Who is this? Who is this?

34:34.907 --> 34:38.308
She will render you useless
and you will suffer.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.620
- Pegeen told me where you live.
- Is this Louise?

34:47.719 --> 34:50.254
- You stay away from her.
- Louise?

34:56.159 --> 34:57.630
- Yes.
- I know she's there.

34:57.730 --> 35:01.598
Why won't you put her on the phone?
Put her on the phone right now.

35:05.737 --> 35:09.241
- Hello? Hello?
- Where is she? I just want to see her.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.535
- Louise, just...
- I just... I just need to see her.

35:11.635 --> 35:13.312
- What are...
- I just... just need to talk to her.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.331
- I just need to look into her eyes...
- What are you doing?

35:15.431 --> 35:19.382
...and just ask her why.
Just ask her why.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.448
Are you alone?

35:25.357 --> 35:26.458
Oh, God. Oh.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.673
- Are you alone?
- I'm sorry. I'm alone.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.966
Okay. Miss...

35:34.066 --> 35:37.069
- Miss Trenner, I presume?
- Yes. And you...

35:37.868 --> 35:39.471
You're older than I thought.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.741
- What do you think you're doing here?
- I know. I'm trespassing.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.898
Could you lower your gun, please?
You're making me very nervous.

35:45.998 --> 35:48.915
You're making me very nervous.
You're peeping into my house.

35:49.015 --> 35:52.417
I just wanted to see where
she was going every weekend.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.991
She...

35:54.091 --> 35:59.058
she told me she'd be with me forever
and then three weeks later she was gone.

36:00.058 --> 36:03.796
I don't know why she left you for me.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.931
- Don't you?
- No, I don't.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.734
You're beautiful. You're gorgeous.
You're a valkyrie.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.037
What am I? I'm an old man.

36:11.737 --> 36:12.696
True.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.742
Good. Why don't you come
inside for a minute?

36:16.842 --> 36:19.144
Why? So you could seduce me, too?

36:19.244 --> 36:22.119
Is that your specialty, Mr. Axler,
converting lesbians?

36:22.948 --> 36:26.966
Madam, it is not I who is trespassing.

36:27.066 --> 36:29.655
It is not I who is a Peeping Tom.

36:29.755 --> 36:34.689
It is not I who is making anonymous
phone calls in the middle of the night

36:34.789 --> 36:38.030
- asking for a "Mr. Famous."
- Oh, God.

36:38.130 --> 36:41.301
- Is she worth all this?
- No. She's not even that beautiful.

36:42.101 --> 36:44.776
- She's not that intelligent.
- Okay.

36:45.204 --> 36:50.009
She's unusually childish for her age.
She's just a kid, really.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.177
So, why don't you come inside?

36:52.577 --> 36:55.184
Why do you want me to step inside?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.050
Because of the triumph it would
be to sleep with the woman

36:58.150 --> 37:00.519
that Pegeen used to sleep with?

37:01.319 --> 37:03.354
- Because I'm being polite.
- No.

37:03.454 --> 37:06.956
- Because it's cold out and you...
- You want to fuck me.

37:09.093 --> 37:12.098
You think you're safe, but you're not.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.235
When she's through playing
with you, she's going to...

37:16.735 --> 37:21.170
take you apart like a
cheap Christmas toy.

37:25.943 --> 37:29.849
I was up for the position at Westcott
and Louise wouldn't give me the job,

37:29.949 --> 37:33.652
so I met with her and then
I turned on all the charm.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.062
I was desperate. I had to.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.024
She wasn't going to give you the job?

37:39.124 --> 37:42.294
- No, that's what I just said.
- I know, but why?

37:42.394 --> 37:46.435
Had she seen you before?
Was it something about...

37:47.899 --> 37:50.975
It was possible that I might not
have been the strongest candidate

37:51.075 --> 37:53.775
that they were looking at,
but I had other things to offer,

37:53.875 --> 37:56.580
which I let her know, wink wink.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.312
She just wasn't going to give it to me.
I wasn't their top candidate.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.780
Well, how did... how did she know that?

38:02.080 --> 38:05.284
I had heard it through
the academic grapevine.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.320
It's academia, it's not the NSA.

38:08.420 --> 38:12.147
- Why are you so obsessed with this, Simon?
- I just want to know. I just want to know.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.712
Are you sure you don't like
me in my present uniform?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.952
Let me just get this.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.987
Why don't you go inside?
I'll meet you there.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.555
Okay.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.724
Yeah.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.394
Yeah. Jerry.

38:48.494 --> 38:51.997
Hi, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no. No more acting.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.166
No acting. No, no.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.837
No acting. I just...

38:57.937 --> 39:01.540
Why don't you get me a deal
writing my memoirs?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.944
Well, isn't that what
washed-up actors do?

39:05.644 --> 39:07.945
Why did you take her shopping?

39:08.045 --> 39:09.348
I don't know.

39:09.448 --> 39:15.009
Did you want her to become a woman
or just to look like one?

39:15.109 --> 39:16.989
I mean, you know,

39:17.089 --> 39:19.358
when you're enacting a role,

39:19.458 --> 39:22.494
usually you dress accordingly.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.483
Otherwise you confuse the audience.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.727
Is that what she wanted?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.068
I don't know. It's the way I saw it.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.605
You've slept with her at this point.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.609
I think so.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.153
I don't know.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.122
Yeah.

39:50.622 --> 39:51.821
- Well...
- I like it.

39:53.657 --> 39:58.597
Well, I guess this officially marks
the end of my 16-year mistake.

39:59.184 --> 40:00.834
Yeah.

40:02.134 --> 40:05.902
Did she actually say "16-year mistake"?

40:07.872 --> 40:10.475
I don't know. I'm not sure. I mean...

40:10.775 --> 40:13.712
Or is that what you wanted to hear?

40:13.812 --> 40:16.715
Well, I don't know. I'm not sure.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.517
I mean, there's a lot of things she says

40:18.617 --> 40:21.687
I'm not sure I'm hearing
what she's saying

40:21.787 --> 40:24.723
or what I'm making up that she says.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.259
I mean, I don't know.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.596
Half the ti...
I don't know how she thinks.

40:30.696 --> 40:35.067
I don't know what's on her mind.
She seems so detached.

40:35.167 --> 40:39.504
She seems so removed. And yet...

40:39.604 --> 40:42.906
when I'm with her,
there's a feeling I have.

40:44.041 --> 40:45.678
- Yeah.
- It's nice?

40:45.778 --> 40:48.447
You look a little bit like you're
still on the hanger.

40:48.547 --> 40:51.049
I think that works though
because you can...

40:51.149 --> 40:53.051
I feel like a matador.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.720
What... what's it matter?

40:54.820 --> 40:57.737
I mean, three quarters of the things
we do in life are mistakes.

40:58.223 --> 41:02.298
I mean, you know, my being an actor,
that's a fucking mistake.

41:02.398 --> 41:05.731
Could be. I mean, you get all
the awards, the accolades,

41:05.831 --> 41:09.003
the special treatment,
all that stuff, the adulation,

41:09.103 --> 41:13.138
and what do you wind up doing?
Throwing yourself off a stage.

41:13.309 --> 41:18.003
Now, come on. While trying to pull
some Hemingway-esque suicide.

41:19.144 --> 41:22.648
I mean, you know,
the other day I'm watching television

41:22.748 --> 41:27.632
and this commercial comes on,
and they're promoting Hemingway furniture.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.988
I mean, here's a guy,

41:30.088 --> 41:34.593
blew the top of his head off
because he couldn't take life anymore

41:34.793 --> 41:38.997
and now you can get a
Hemingway bedroom set.

41:39.242 --> 41:43.099
I don't know why it makes me laugh.

41:44.201 --> 41:48.773
You know? He wrote books, by the way.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.207
I know you know that, but I'm saying.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.114
She seemed pleasant.

41:59.984 --> 42:01.453
Who?

42:01.553 --> 42:04.487
The woman's that been here
from time to time.

42:05.423 --> 42:08.560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

42:08.660 --> 42:12.395
There's been someone here, hasn't there?

42:13.397 --> 42:14.500
What?

42:14.600 --> 42:18.040
There's been somebody here.
Yeah, I have someone that comes in.

42:18.140 --> 42:21.808
She comes in now and then,
you know, helps me.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.870
With my...

42:24.970 --> 42:27.369
- recuperation.
- Yeah.

42:27.946 --> 42:31.783
- Is she a massage therapist?
- Oh, no, no. No.

42:31.883 --> 42:37.153
She just, you know, has... Sometimes I
could stretch it for her, you know, she...

42:38.356 --> 42:40.926
It's okay, though. It's fine.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.862
Yeah. And she only just
comes here now and then.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.843
It's not my business.
It's not my business.

42:45.943 --> 42:50.068
No, no. I don't... No... it's...
it's fair to ask something like that.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.335
I don't want to interfere.

42:55.272 --> 42:57.343
She seems very pleasant.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.112
Yeah.

43:00.512 --> 43:03.115
Why? You... you've been talking to her?

43:03.215 --> 43:05.717
No, I just saw her.

43:05.817 --> 43:08.387
- You just exchanged hellos and stuff?
- Yeah.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.957
Nothing more than that. I mean,
you didn't ask her any questions?

43:12.557 --> 43:14.493
- No.
- Just... just for my own...

43:14.593 --> 43:19.131
- Well, I wouldn't say anything.
- Yeah, because... well, we like to keep it...

43:19.531 --> 43:21.633
like we always keep it.

43:21.833 --> 43:24.569
You mean me and you

43:24.669 --> 43:27.537
or her and me and you?

43:30.541 --> 43:34.346
- I really don't understand.
- I... I don't know, you said, "we".

43:34.446 --> 43:36.248
No, I meant in the...
you know, in the sort of...

43:36.348 --> 43:38.584
- In a general...
- In the general way.

43:38.684 --> 43:42.921
Well, you should have someone
nice coming to take care of you...

43:43.021 --> 43:44.621
at your age.

43:48.893 --> 43:50.159
Good morning.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.162
What?

43:58.436 --> 44:00.161
Good morning.

44:02.673 --> 44:05.541
Okay. Okay.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.615
I don't have Alzheimer's.

44:10.715 --> 44:13.352
I'm not demen... it's not dementia.

44:13.452 --> 44:16.154
It's something else.

44:16.254 --> 44:19.258
It's this inertia

44:19.358 --> 44:21.293
when it comes to the...

44:21.393 --> 44:23.662
We used to call it "the work".

44:23.862 --> 44:27.166
You see, so the abandonment is...

44:27.266 --> 44:31.136
is so severe and it causes such pain

44:31.236 --> 44:34.753
because... or it causes confusion,

44:34.853 --> 44:38.410
fear as I don't know where to go.

44:39.311 --> 44:42.781
Dear Simon, how are you? You look well.

44:42.881 --> 44:45.917
I need to see you again.
You're my only friend.

44:46.017 --> 44:50.222
Yours and hugs, Sybil Van Buren.

44:50.722 --> 44:53.658
Hey. Look what I found.

44:53.758 --> 44:56.761
The Seagull starring Simon Axler.

44:56.861 --> 45:00.932
Bootleg copy live from The Globe.
Can we watch it, please?

45:01.032 --> 45:03.969
I found this woman and somehow

45:04.069 --> 45:05.170
there's an appetite.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.173
I know it's...
it looks like it's tentative,

45:08.273 --> 45:10.775
It looks like it's going
to slip away from me,

45:10.875 --> 45:13.411
but at the same time, so what?

45:13.511 --> 45:16.915
I don't know what's right for me.
I don't know what's wrong for me.

45:17.015 --> 45:21.987
I have no idea, nor does anyone,
really, when it comes down to it.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.923
But I like that line from Shakespeare,

45:25.023 --> 45:27.926
- you know, "Perdition catch my soul."
- "Perdition catch my soul."

45:28.026 --> 45:30.727
- "But I do love thee."
- "But I do love thee."

45:31.929 --> 45:32.932
And...

45:33.432 --> 45:35.871
when I love thee not...

45:37.135 --> 45:40.269
chaos is come again.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.941
Okay, I'm going to take that as a "no."

45:55.626 --> 45:57.190
Simon!

46:01.359 --> 46:03.359
- Hi.
- Are you surprised?

46:06.563 --> 46:11.169
That you're suddenly here in my woods,

46:11.469 --> 46:13.505
on my property?

46:13.605 --> 46:16.172
I'm surprised. Yeah.

46:24.448 --> 46:27.152
I would rather speak privately.

46:27.252 --> 46:31.790
Do you know of someplace
quiet that we could go?

46:32.190 --> 46:35.480
Quieter than the woods? I mean...

46:36.260 --> 46:38.563
The monster is all alone with them.

46:38.763 --> 46:40.299
Yeah.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.167
That's terrible.

46:42.567 --> 46:46.535
Have you... have you given
any more thought to my offer?

46:48.472 --> 46:50.573
No, I haven't.

46:51.975 --> 46:55.244
- Not at all?
- No. I haven't.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.049
Okay.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.643
Christening.

47:07.743 --> 47:09.328
So...

47:09.828 --> 47:12.397
Oh, gee. What is that?

47:12.497 --> 47:16.301
So, Edgar goes for a walk
in these gardens every night.

47:16.401 --> 47:18.703
- Yeah.
- Okay, now, look... look, look, look

47:18.803 --> 47:22.107
- how simple it would be to climb...
- No.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.373
Simon, please.

47:25.442 --> 47:27.479
Why are you doing this to me?

47:28.079 --> 47:31.082
Because you're the only
person that I trust.

47:31.182 --> 47:33.284
Trust? You don't know me.

47:33.384 --> 47:36.288
- I don't know you. I just met...
- I know you.

47:36.888 --> 47:40.892
You're asking me to do... such a thing.

47:41.292 --> 47:42.994
- You understand?
- Yes.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.430
Why would you ask me to do such a thing?

47:45.530 --> 47:48.867
Because you have experience, Simon.

47:49.467 --> 47:51.621
- What are you talking about?
- In the movies.

47:51.721 --> 47:54.239
I know, but the movies,
they're not real.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.675
So that's not real experience.

47:56.775 --> 48:00.645
Okay, but you've held a real gun
and you've had training.

48:00.745 --> 48:02.914
Not with real bullets.

48:03.014 --> 48:06.818
Everything I do in the movies,
any actor does, is fake.

48:07.118 --> 48:08.953
- You understand? It's not real.
- Yes. But...

48:09.053 --> 48:10.622
- No, it's pretend.
- But...

48:10.722 --> 48:11.657
It's pretend.

48:11.757 --> 48:15.160
But pretend that your acting background

48:15.260 --> 48:19.199
will help when it comes time
to talk to the police.

48:21.432 --> 48:24.503
- This is ridiculous. Ridiculous, ridiculous.
- Do not call me "ridiculous."

48:24.603 --> 48:25.904
- I'm not calling you...
- I am not ridiculous.

48:26.004 --> 48:28.740
I'm saying this is ridiculous.
I am ridiculous.

48:28.840 --> 48:33.044
I've been called ridiculous
by my husband, by my family,

48:33.144 --> 48:35.547
by my friends, by lawyers, and doctors,

48:35.647 --> 48:39.050
- and everyone else but you.
- Well, I'm ridiculous, too.

48:39.150 --> 48:40.952
Simon, I just need your help.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.689
I can't. I'm sorry, I just...

48:43.889 --> 48:47.025
- I'm begging you.
- I know, darling, but I can't do it.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.327
You're going to have to go elsewhere.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.731
Please. So, I have to go back anyway.

48:52.831 --> 48:54.232
- I got things I have to do.
- Back where?

48:54.332 --> 48:56.167
- Well, I got to go back to...
- Where are you going?

48:56.267 --> 49:00.439
To my house and you go to
your house, wherever that is.

49:00.539 --> 49:02.574
I don't know where your house is.

49:02.674 --> 49:05.076
- I have no idea where you live.
- Do you want to come over?

49:05.176 --> 49:07.246
- No, I don't want to go to your house.
- Wait...

49:07.979 --> 49:10.849
You have to go elsewhere, you know.

49:10.949 --> 49:14.286
I can't... I can't help you. I'm sorry.

49:14.386 --> 49:17.121
You're b... you're busy.
You sound busy, so we'll...

49:17.421 --> 49:18.857
- We'll do this later.
- No, it's not about being busy.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.920
- Right.
- Go... go... come...

49:21.020 --> 49:22.850
you know, maybe another time.

49:23.027 --> 49:25.196
- Later on, someday.
- Pick it up. Right.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.705
Someday, long time from now.

49:27.805 --> 49:29.133
- Thursday.
- Maybe...

49:29.233 --> 49:31.040
- Like Thursday?
- No, not Thursday. No!

49:31.140 --> 49:32.904
- Another time. That's not Thursday.
- What?

49:33.004 --> 49:35.907
- Thursday's now. I mean later.
- Simon, you're yelling. I can't hear you.

49:36.007 --> 49:38.007
- Next century.
- What?

49:40.577 --> 49:44.516
As time went on, I became more
and more dependent on her.

49:45.216 --> 49:50.460
Always waiting for the sound of
that car on that gravel driveway.

50:04.101 --> 50:07.105
- Hello.
- Oh. Hey.

50:07.305 --> 50:10.308
Oh. Look at this.

50:10.408 --> 50:12.644
- This is Emily.
- Aw, Emily.

50:12.944 --> 50:14.212
Hey, beauty.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.145
- Here, let me take that.
- Thank you.

50:17.348 --> 50:20.452
Oh. Oh, my God. Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

50:20.552 --> 50:22.353
Yeah. Gee! I got this.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.990
Oh, no. Look at what happened to him.

50:25.933 --> 50:27.426
What's in here?

50:27.526 --> 50:30.684
Just some of my things, isn't it, baby?
Some of my things.

50:30.784 --> 50:33.498
You know... I was thinking...

50:33.598 --> 50:37.641
Don't you think it's time...
you told your parents about us?

50:37.741 --> 50:41.640
Oh, no, no, no.
My mother can never know about...

50:41.740 --> 50:43.713
- What?
- Anything.

50:45.009 --> 50:47.011
Why? What do you mean?

50:47.111 --> 50:50.582
Even if the two of you hadn't had a
thing for each other back in the day...

50:50.682 --> 50:54.052
What thing? Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

50:54.152 --> 50:56.921
I'm just saying I could never...

50:57.021 --> 51:00.258
I could not possibly tell her or him.

51:00.358 --> 51:04.195
Oh, God, think of the look on
Asa's face. That would be terrible.

51:04.295 --> 51:07.866
It'd just be way too painful, wouldn't it?
Oh, you want to go?

51:07.966 --> 51:10.913
- Let's get settled in.
- Yeah. I can't...

51:11.013 --> 51:14.070
- Thank you so much for trying to help.
- Thank you.

51:31.488 --> 51:33.322
I'll be okay.

51:35.692 --> 51:37.593
Oh, yes.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.236
I've come to serve you.

51:45.336 --> 51:49.205
- Is your back still hurting?
- No, dear. No.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.344
It's going to pass.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.114
This is how you played Richard III?

51:56.214 --> 51:58.516
No, this was Igor

51:58.616 --> 52:01.052
in Old Frankenstein.

52:01.652 --> 52:03.744
Well, it's very convincing.

52:03.844 --> 52:07.624
Well, I got this far.
It's just getting it down

52:07.724 --> 52:10.962
that I have to deal with. Oh, yes.

52:11.062 --> 52:13.332
Oh, yes.

52:13.832 --> 52:15.878
We have arrived.

52:16.901 --> 52:20.138
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.207
I'm not going to make it to the bed.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.442
That's fine.

52:24.542 --> 52:27.279
So this will be an all-nighter...

52:27.879 --> 52:29.414
of watching.

52:29.514 --> 52:33.451
And I'm going to read out loud to you
from the medieval miracle plays.

52:33.551 --> 52:36.521
I'm in the middle of Abraham and Isaac.

52:36.921 --> 52:40.458
Abraham's just told Isaac
that God told him to kill Isaac

52:40.558 --> 52:44.395
and Isaac, weirdly,
is telling him that it's okay.

52:44.495 --> 52:48.499
And he's saying,
"Ye have other children, one or two,

52:48.599 --> 52:54.272
"which ye should love well by kind,
I pray you, father, make ye no woe."

52:54.572 --> 52:57.373
- Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.
- Good morning, dear.

53:20.230 --> 53:23.234
You saw a man by the water?

53:23.634 --> 53:24.836
Yeah.

53:24.936 --> 53:29.440
Simon, you seem to have a lot of
people showing up on your property.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.578
There's a guy wandering
around my property.

53:33.578 --> 53:36.011
See? See there?

53:37.113 --> 53:40.585
- You see him? Oh, my.
- Maybe it's a gardener.

53:41.085 --> 53:44.055
A gardener? No. He's a black man.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.257
You wouldn't hire a black gardener?

53:46.357 --> 53:49.460
Of course I would,
but I don't have a black gardener.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.695
That's racist.

53:51.521 --> 53:52.963
What?

53:53.063 --> 53:55.800
- A little racist. Just saying.
- Racist?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.836
Oh, so Pegeen was also there.

53:59.036 --> 54:01.723
Yes, she was there.
I didn't mention that,

54:01.823 --> 54:06.018
but we went down to the little bridge,
that small little bridge by the river.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.881
Oh, my God.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.717
- Priscilla?
- Hey.

54:13.099 --> 54:14.886
Priscilla?

54:14.986 --> 54:18.589
Priscilla? I thought you said
it was a man by the water.

54:18.789 --> 54:22.527
Jesus. I can't even
look at you like this.

54:23.027 --> 54:26.197
I needed to see for myself.
I needed to be sure.

54:26.297 --> 54:29.167
- Sure of what?
- That you were sleeping with a man.

54:29.267 --> 54:31.202
Oh, my God.

54:31.302 --> 54:33.071
Am I missing something here?

54:33.271 --> 54:37.408
Am I missing something? Are you
leaving something out of this story?

54:38.108 --> 54:41.112
No, well, I mean,
they were talking about...

54:41.212 --> 54:43.214
they were talking about health insurance

54:43.314 --> 54:45.750
and that kind of stuff. Healthcare.

54:45.850 --> 54:50.421
Also, how expensive the surgery was.

54:50.521 --> 54:53.424
Are you all healed?

54:53.624 --> 54:56.394
For the most part. I go by Prince now.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.897
Prince? You got to be joking.

54:59.697 --> 55:02.692
They were living, I mean, I think they...
they were dating for something

55:02.792 --> 55:05.770
like six years. And at that time,

55:06.370 --> 55:07.705
she was Priscilla.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.672
And what happened then?

55:11.941 --> 55:15.277
Well, come inside.

55:17.814 --> 55:20.051
Simon, put the gun down.

55:20.951 --> 55:23.886
- What is this?
- He's my ex-girlfriend.

55:31.661 --> 55:34.132
How's Em... how's Emily?

55:34.232 --> 55:37.866
- She's good. She misses Amy.
- I miss her.

55:39.368 --> 55:40.571
Who's Amy?

55:40.771 --> 55:43.340
Our other cat.
We had to separate them when I left.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.340
Poor things.

55:46.743 --> 55:49.514
Who sat with you during the surgery?

55:50.014 --> 55:51.847
No one.

55:53.884 --> 55:56.352
I wish I could say I felt sorry for you.

55:57.954 --> 56:00.425
I'm not asking for your pity.

56:00.525 --> 56:02.694
It was something I had to do on my own.

56:03.894 --> 56:06.462
Not to say it wasn't lonely without you.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.131
Still is.

56:10.567 --> 56:12.971
What are you suggesting?

56:13.571 --> 56:15.473
I miss you.

56:15.573 --> 56:18.343
- And?
- And...

56:18.643 --> 56:24.379
I thought now that you're
sleeping with men...

56:25.849 --> 56:27.419
why not me?

56:28.419 --> 56:31.389
- I want you back.
- No, no. It's out of the question.

56:31.489 --> 56:34.425
You just left so abruptly

56:34.525 --> 56:37.261
after you found the pills
and looked them up.

56:37.361 --> 56:39.964
I can't believe that you
actually went through with it.

56:40.264 --> 56:44.035
I can't even think
about it without cringing.

56:44.135 --> 56:46.737
Breast removal? And not to mention...

56:47.442 --> 56:50.275
I can't even think about it.
I just cringe.

56:51.175 --> 56:54.655
You mutilated the body I loved.
You destroyed the woman I loved.

56:56.647 --> 56:59.917
Pegeen, please. Try to understand
from my point of view.

57:00.017 --> 57:02.353
Whose point of view?

57:02.453 --> 57:05.521
Prince's? I don't know you.
I don't know Prince.

57:07.490 --> 57:11.593
The woman I was with doesn't exist.

57:13.697 --> 57:16.501
Do you regret having invited him in?

57:16.601 --> 57:19.070
You know something?
I don't know what's worse.

57:19.170 --> 57:20.771
When I was here alone in my house,

57:21.071 --> 57:24.375
I was so desperate, you know. And now...

57:25.359 --> 57:30.507
I have these lunatics
showing up at my front door.

57:30.882 --> 57:32.211
I think they know I'm here.

57:33.150 --> 57:34.852
They smell me.

57:36.487 --> 57:38.056
Open up.

57:38.756 --> 57:41.592
- Lower the window. Jesus.
- Oh, it's true.

57:41.692 --> 57:44.461
- I've come to collect my daughter.
- Collect?

57:44.761 --> 57:45.963
- Get out of the car now.
- No!

57:46.063 --> 57:48.099
Get out of the car.
You're coming with me now.

57:48.199 --> 57:49.834
- Stop it!
- Excuse me.

57:50.434 --> 57:53.334
No! Pegeen.

57:55.505 --> 57:58.209
Emily! Oh, my God!

57:58.809 --> 58:01.509
- Emily!
- Who's Emily?

58:02.112 --> 58:04.015
Oh, Emily.

58:04.315 --> 58:08.486
Look what you've done.
You sad, pathetic, little old man.

58:09.289 --> 58:10.554
What a mess you've done.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.657
- How did you find out?
- How did we find out?

58:12.757 --> 58:14.925
I got a call from Louise Trenner.

58:15.225 --> 58:18.095
She began by saying she
was opportunistically

58:18.195 --> 58:20.965
exploited and deceived by you.

58:21.065 --> 58:24.302
- Is that true, dear?
- We have to go to the vet now!

58:24.402 --> 58:27.038
Just imagine what it was
like to get a call like that.

58:27.138 --> 58:30.108
I have absolutely no idea
what's going on in your life.

58:30.208 --> 58:32.010
When did you break up with Priscilla?

58:32.310 --> 58:36.280
When Priscilla decided that she wanted
to become a man, Mother, okay?

58:36.380 --> 58:39.230
And you don't think that that was news
you want to share with your own parents?

58:39.330 --> 58:41.419
What else have you been keeping from us?

58:41.519 --> 58:44.722
Look, let's just get in.
What... is she all right?

58:44.822 --> 58:47.425
Simon, you do not have a family.

58:47.525 --> 58:50.961
You don't know what it's like to find out
who's sleeping with your daughter.

58:51.061 --> 58:53.965
- Your daughter is a grown-up.
- Yeah, and you're ancient.

58:54.065 --> 58:56.734
How could you. Your own goddaughter?

58:56.834 --> 58:58.469
I mean, I know you've
been having mental issues,

58:58.569 --> 59:01.071
- but this is beyond insane.
- Get in the car, honey.

59:01.171 --> 59:03.674
What does he have to offer you?

59:03.774 --> 59:05.643
Is it money?

59:06.043 --> 59:09.180
Oh, my baby. Oh, sweet baby.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.484
You know, you look just so...

59:13.584 --> 59:16.387
- beautiful and so...
- You mean feminine?

59:16.487 --> 59:17.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:17.922 --> 59:19.388
Feminine.

59:32.669 --> 59:34.486
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, hi.

59:34.586 --> 59:37.008
Her leg got run over by a car.

59:37.108 --> 59:40.244
- Okay, let's take her in the back.
- Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.

59:40.344 --> 59:42.783
Oh, God. Not again. Oh, my God.

59:42.883 --> 59:44.795
I'm afraid you're all going
to have to wait out here.

59:47.050 --> 59:50.287
Do you have anything that you could
give him? Like painkillers or something?

59:50.387 --> 59:51.656
- No.
- He's a person.

59:51.875 --> 59:54.458
No, like what you'd give a dog,
but just for him.

59:54.558 --> 59:56.893
Like ten times more or something?

59:58.462 --> 01:00:01.532
I don't think we should tell
anybody about this, Mr. Axler.

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:04.635
And the muscle relaxers
start to kick in rather quickly.

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:07.305
Oh, yeah. A little discretion...

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:10.105
will be much appreciated.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:14.550
I think you're making a mistake.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:20.215
You've been through a breakdown
that led you to being institutionalized.

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:26.123
Now, I know that she's had these
fantasies about you since childhood.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:29.194
I know she glorified you and she...

01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:33.127
cried about you and she...

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.864
she dreamt about you, and she loved you.

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.403
And she's built up these fantasies.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.976
How would you know?

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:51.882
What?

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.151
What did he say?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.253
- How...
- What?

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:57.722
How would you know?

01:00:57.822 --> 01:01:00.658
How would you know? How would you know?

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.894
How do you know what he's saying?

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:07.131
How would I know what?
About my own daughter?

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:11.101
Because I'm her mother,
that's how I know.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:14.769
That's how I know! It's how I know!

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.545
You're getting older by the day.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.984
- Oh, really?
- You're 65 now.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:30.020
And soon, you'll be 66.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.957
And then, 67.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.292
And so on.

01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:38.396
It never stops.

01:01:38.496 --> 01:01:42.675
And it won't be long before they're just
wheeling you around in a chair.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:46.337
Well, if I had...

01:01:46.437 --> 01:01:48.439
I have no idea what he's saying.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:52.610
- If I had a child...
- What are you... what is he saying?

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.878
- What is he saying?
- What...

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:57.114
Simon, do you hear her?

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.061
I know you hear her.

01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:01.285
- Yeah.
- And this is serious.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.354
What is he saying?

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:05.723
You will stop...

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:08.659
seeing our daughter.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:11.328
- Yes.
- As of tonight!

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:16.541
- Yes.
- I never said I would not ever...

01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:20.871
No. Simon. Simon, listen. Simon.

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.240
It's not going to be good for you.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.876
Simon, it's not going to turn out well.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:28.879
And it's not going to
turn out well for her.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.581
You have to stop.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.617
Okay.

01:02:32.717 --> 01:02:35.519
Pegeen started talking to
her mother more and more.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:36.822
Click. Click the pen.

01:02:37.822 --> 01:02:40.758
No, everything's fine with my classes.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:46.885
I don't know why she would take these
Simon-bashing calls under my own roof.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:51.068
Okay. Anyway, well, love you, too.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.868
Talk to you later, Mom. Bye.

01:02:58.507 --> 01:03:00.678
So, what did your mother have to say?

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:05.149
The usual. She thinks I'm starstruck.

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:10.754
Oh, but she couldn't stop talking about
how pathetic you were at the vet.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.123
It's really her favorite topic now.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:15.993
She keeps using the word "feeble."

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:19.597
And then, she says, "He's a shell
of a man. A shell of a man."

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:24.240
It's really great. It's like a
whole new routine she's got.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.971
I wish I was there.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:30.318
So, why'd you go upstairs?

01:03:30.418 --> 01:03:33.877
I was just looking around upstairs
when she called.

01:03:34.191 --> 01:03:35.846
- Looking around?
- Yeah.

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:40.015
It's great. It's so big up here.
Why don't you ever use it?

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:45.422
I don't know. Just... I'm not ready.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.859
What do you mean you're not ready?
You've lived here for 14 years.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.662
Yeah, but I like it down here.

01:03:51.762 --> 01:03:55.899
I like it. This is like an apartment.
You know, like a New York apartment.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:58.168
It's like an apartment with a pool.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.938
Well, nothing... nothing's perfect.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.298
So, tell me about your mom.

01:04:03.398 --> 01:04:06.221
I think it gives her something
to live for. Her hating you...

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:10.114
Do you have any idea why she cares
so much about what her parents think?

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:11.916
A lot of animosity?

01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:15.386
- No, but why does this upset you?
- Well, because it's upsetting.

01:04:15.486 --> 01:04:18.388
I mean, here she is... she's... she's...

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:22.359
Shouldn't they be happy that she's getting
someone who's achieved something in life?

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:25.796
Who's done things, who's lived,
who can offer her something?

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:28.799
I mean, after all,
she's not getting any younger.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:31.902
And why does she act like this?

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:34.405
You know, Pegeen and her transformation

01:04:34.505 --> 01:04:38.655
is like this orgy of spending
and spoiling.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.911
And I'm out of money.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:45.482
I'm just... I'm just, you know.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.719
Simon, there's desperation
in your voice.

01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:51.889
Well, I'm out of money,
I can't act anymore,

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:55.625
and what am I going to do?
How am I going to keep her?

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.626
You shouldn't have to
buy Pegeen's affection.

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.700
What if I do?

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.535
So I talked to your accountant.

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:07.404
You're spending way too much
money on women's clothing.

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.940
Way too much money on women's clothing.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.060
Do you have any idea what it costs
to heat a pool in Connecticut

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.915
in the dead of winter? And on top of that,
you're giving her spending money.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:22.086
I know I'm spending too much money.
What about the book deal?

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:26.323
There's not that much interest.
There won't be enough advanced dollars.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.460
Oh. That's kind of depressing.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.931
Not that much interest in my life.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:37.101
Well, you're the one
who lost interest first.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.703
Maybe some commercials?

01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:41.575
Yeah,

01:05:41.675 --> 01:05:43.896
we'll talk again.

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:03.995
Hi.

01:06:04.495 --> 01:06:06.637
Do you ever come out?

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:09.166
You should come in.

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:12.403
I don't know, you know.
I don't think I'm dressed for it.

01:06:12.503 --> 01:06:14.905
Yeah, but... guess what?

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:19.343
You don't even have to be afraid
to swim because I'm a lifeguard.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:22.710
Certified. I could save your life.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.716
You already have.

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.188
You already have.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.369
Who is it? Who is it?

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:47.271
It's your agent!

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:50.974
Look, Simon, be happy.
Your fan mail has really picked up.

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:53.243
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean...

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:58.148
I mean, they're all from the same woman,
this Sybil Van Buren woman, but still...

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:04.021
They're going to offer you $150,000
to be the spokesperson.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:07.124
- You'll travel to Europe...
- Spokesperson? For what?

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:09.326
For a new specialized technique.

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:12.429
- It's called a "hair-ation."
- Hair-ation?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:16.066
It's a special technique
developed by a Dr. Kingsley...

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:19.136
- For?
- ...for everything in the general...

01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:20.336
hair area.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:24.574
- So, a hair loss product.
- Well, if you put it like that...

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:28.212
- Have you lost your mind completely?
- $150,000.

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:30.781
I don't care how much.
What does it matter?

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:35.753
What about my dignity?
I mean, what little of it I have left.

01:07:35.853 --> 01:07:39.323
Do something real then.
Take the role on Broadway.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:42.292
- What role?
- The King Lear role on Broadway.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.327
- King Lear?
- I've told you before.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.597
- I'm telling you again. The King Lear...
- You're telling me again?

01:07:46.697 --> 01:07:48.832
- Yes. Yes.
- This is the first time I'm hearing it.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:51.068
No, it's... no, well, King Lear...

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:53.837
They want you for King Lear on Broadway.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:55.039
Oh, they want me.

01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:57.939
I mean, you love tragedy.

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:03.113
How many times? What do I have to do?

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.149
Do you want me to say it out loud?

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:09.353
There's a buzz about you.
They want to see you.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:12.712
They want to see if you'll jump again.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.059
You know, like Spiderman.
People just went to see...

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.095
Where they're flying around
on all those cables...

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.430
- if somebody would fall.
- Sort of like the circus.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.666
You've got to do something.
You have no money.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.301
I've become a freak.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.069
- They're coming to see the freak.
- You got to...

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.736
Get me a commercial that has hair in it.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.295
My hair.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:35.845
- Yeah. Yeah. Almost.
- Okay.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.515
- No cigar.
- Right.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.917
All right. Let me try one more time.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:44.952
You know, I don't think you should.
I think you should really just rest it.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.791
Maybe...

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:50.359
Maybe we try it on the side.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.294
- Let's just...
- Okay. Okay. All right.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.966
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, oh, oh no.

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:59.536
Oh, gosh. Oh, no.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.038
Oh, this can't...
this can't be happening.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.341
Well, it is.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:06.810
Just give it a day or so, you know.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:11.081
- This thing has to loosen up, that's all.
- Sure. Sure. Of course.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.983
You know, because...

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:17.018
sometimes it takes three days,
so I got one more day left.

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:22.626
You know, I just got to get...

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.696
I got to get into the
exercise part of it, you know?

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:28.866
Get into a routine
and just do it every day.

01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:31.135
- Lie there, you know.
- Yeah.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.403
Go through the stretches.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.611
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.438
You know that... that...

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:45.883
horse tranquilizer that the vet gave me?
I mean, that... that was pretty good.

01:09:45.983 --> 01:09:50.252
- Yeah, it was so good.
- Yeah, it turned out okay that night.

01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:52.904
Yeah.

01:09:56.894 --> 01:09:59.062
Anything I can do to help here?

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.992
I don't think you fucked
the lesbian out of me yet.

01:10:07.104 --> 01:10:10.040
Are you still sleeping
with women, Pegeen?

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.509
- Just twice.
- Twice?

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:15.048
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:20.258
- With Louise?
- Yeah. No. No. Don't be crazy.

01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:23.720
Well, with whom then?

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.771
Just a couple of softball girls I found.

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.664
This isn't a love story.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:37.467
This is an object of my affection, okay?

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:42.039
A fucking cliche is what it is.
That's what I've become.

01:10:42.139 --> 01:10:44.441
I'm a love cliche.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:48.446
She's a young woman.
That whole thing, you know.

01:10:48.946 --> 01:10:52.622
At least she's a lesbian.
I wasn't that stupid.

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:55.152
I picked the right one though, didn't I?

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:57.955
I mean, this one's bound to leave me.

01:10:58.055 --> 01:11:01.459
Bound to leave me, but you know...
I do deserve it.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:05.262
Everything I get, I deserve.
And you know what?

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:07.934
I go into it with that open mind.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:11.117
Because fuck it. Give it to me.

01:11:11.217 --> 01:11:14.739
Give me all you got.
I'll take it. I wish for it.

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:17.472
I glory in it.

01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:24.948
Pegeen turned her last
girlfriend into a man.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:28.452
She turned me into a half-crazed beggar.

01:11:28.552 --> 01:11:31.188
Who knows what she's turned you into.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:34.624
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.245
Yes.

01:11:55.877 --> 01:11:58.515
Jerry, it's me.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:02.368
- I'll do it.
- Really? That's fantastic, Simon.

01:12:02.468 --> 01:12:04.822
I'll call the Broadway producers
first thing in the morning.

01:12:04.922 --> 01:12:07.357
Ever since that swan
dive into the orchestra,

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:10.427
- they've been dying for you to come back.
- No, not King Lear.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.431
The... the other one.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:18.635
Yeah, don't sound
too enthusiastic, please.

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:21.839
- No, I am. The hair product.
- Yeah, right.

01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:25.943
No, that's a good choice, too,
As long as you're back out there, right?

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:29.076
Yes. Yeah.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.756
Dr. Farr, you're not
going to believe this.

01:12:38.856 --> 01:12:42.714
- Sybil showed up again.
- What do you mean she showed up?

01:12:42.814 --> 01:12:45.829
She showed up.
I'm on my way to the commercial,

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:49.166
she's there, she's in
my driveway in the snow.

01:12:49.266 --> 01:12:52.036
She's just, she's just,
she's just stalking me.

01:12:52.136 --> 01:12:54.905
- She keeps stalking me.
- Not again.

01:12:55.005 --> 01:12:58.141
Simon, I'm a little confused.

01:12:58.241 --> 01:13:00.574
Hold on one second.

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.065
Come on out.

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:11.072
Simon, I'm just looking at a
postcard Sybil just sent me.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:14.413
She seems to be in Florida right now.

01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:16.226
Here.

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:18.560
- What's that?
- Money.

01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:21.164
Money? For what?

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:23.400
You know damn well what it's for.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.153
I refuse to come near that.
Now, please stay away with that money.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:32.376
- It's too late, Simon.
- Oh, yeah? And why is that?

01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:35.178
Because you've already agreed
to kill my husband.

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:36.914
- You're an accomplice now.
- No. No.

01:13:37.014 --> 01:13:39.758
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No, no, no.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:41.218
You saw pictures.

01:13:41.318 --> 01:13:44.754
You are deep into this, mister.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.357
- You and I have an understanding.
- We don't have anything.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:51.127
You're going to be... you know the play
Harvey when he has an invisible rabbit?

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:52.288
- Yes.
- That's what you are.

01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:53.861
I will you out of my life.

01:13:53.961 --> 01:13:55.332
- Great.
- You're willed out.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.900
Simon, I don't understand.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.985
Why are you referencing the play Harvey?

01:14:00.085 --> 01:14:04.441
He was an invisible rabbit.
He existed in Elwood's mind.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.543
Was Sybil there?

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:10.144
Or was she not there?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.383
Sybil's a stalker.

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.619
She's crazy.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:19.855
She somehow... all the fan mail
and every... she got it in her head.

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.099
What are you doing?

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:34.151
I am just trying to find
a place in your new life.

01:14:34.251 --> 01:14:35.451
Well, there isn't one.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:38.306
Why can't there be?
We have a beautiful history together.

01:14:39.109 --> 01:14:41.812
What does he have to
offer you that I don't?

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:44.981
I'm younger than him
and more attractive.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:46.416
And in some ways more masculine.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:49.584
Enough, Priscilla.
I am not a heterosexual woman.

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:56.193
I'll be right back.
I have to use the bathroom.

01:14:56.393 --> 01:14:59.360
- Which... which one?
- Simon!

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:01.962
What is wrong with you?

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:06.737
I'm sorry. I'm just, you know...

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:11.939
I don't see why we had
to invite your ex to lunch.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.680
I'm not going to do any commercials.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.580
I'm going to stay home.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:25.589
You're under no obligation to me
what you do when I'm not there.

01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:28.992
It has nothing to do with
the reality you and I share.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.561
That's indecipherable.

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:34.711
So what about you? Are you going to take
a real business trip one of these days

01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:38.018
to the stage or are you
just going to keep wallowing

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:41.644
in your own angst and self pity forever?

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:45.475
I'm sorry, that was mean of me,
what I said back there,

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:49.579
but I don't want to be with somebody
who just gives up on his career.

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:53.372
You don't have to go out there
every night, face an audience

01:15:53.472 --> 01:15:56.153
night after night and lie to them.

01:15:56.253 --> 01:16:00.354
I think you could try harder.
I think you could try harder for me.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:05.462
Show me the man
that is not passion's slave,

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:08.565
and I will wear him in my heart.

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:12.430
Yes. In my heart of hearts.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:17.040
When the mind's free,
the body's delicate,

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.578
the tempest in my mind
doth from my senses

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.546
take all feeling else.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:25.212
Lear.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.683
Let go.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.761
What?

01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:39.529
- Pegeen?
- Yes?

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.665
- She killed him.
- What?

01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:44.534
Sybil Van Buren killed her husband.

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.969
- I can't believe it.
- Really?

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:51.004
Oh, God. She told me
I was an accomplice.

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:54.778
We met at a mental institution.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:17:00.483
She gets out of the hospital,
she comes to my town,

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:03.853
she sends me letters,
she comes to my house.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.922
You know, she became a stalker.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:10.216
And each time I told her, "Please go away.
I want nothing to do with this."

01:17:10.316 --> 01:17:15.331
Mrs. Van Buren said that you encouraged her
to find someone else to kill her husband.

01:17:15.559 --> 01:17:17.099
That's not the way I said it.

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:20.334
But you did say to her, "You ought
to find a professional hitman"?

01:17:22.103 --> 01:17:25.041
Well, yes. Well, yes, I said, but...

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:28.044
Therefore you were encouraging her
to find a way to kill her husband.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.081
- You're twisting the logic. I'm sorry.
- Am I correct?

01:17:30.181 --> 01:17:33.216
I don't mean, you know...
impose on your work.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:36.453
I mean, but that's not... Pegeen?

01:17:36.553 --> 01:17:39.987
- I mean, could you help me here?
- That won't be necessary.

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:44.628
- Okay.
- Were you sexually involved with Sybil?

01:17:44.728 --> 01:17:47.130
No. Please. No.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:52.461
I mean, this is a young woman
in her early 30s at best.

01:17:56.739 --> 01:18:01.676
No. I just... She was a misguided fan.
That's what she was.

01:18:07.048 --> 01:18:09.420
Before you go, I want to let you know

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.146
that I've been doing some
reorganization of your playthings.

01:18:12.246 --> 01:18:13.308
- What playthings?
- Playthings?

01:18:13.408 --> 01:18:16.660
- They shouldn't be left laying around.
- Yes, I agree, Mrs. Rutledge.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.397
Now, the... the mechanical
electronic devices,

01:18:20.497 --> 01:18:25.091
the magic wand,
the G-spot vibrator, and the...

01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:28.337
Jack rabbit, they should
be oiled at least once a month.

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.572
- Yeah, right.
- That's true.

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:32.453
And the pigtail butt plug

01:18:32.553 --> 01:18:35.506
and the... the double dong,
and the fisting mitt,

01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:39.449
- they're going in the washer.
- You're absolutely right, Mrs. Rutledge.

01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:42.182
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:49.023
- Thanks, folks. You have a great evening now.
- You too. Thank you.

01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:54.728
I'm going to be right back.

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:56.899
Okay.

01:18:56.999 --> 01:19:00.403
Oh, I should've known.
I should've known.

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:04.305
The minute Pegeen got up from the table.
I should've known.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:10.680
- No, really?
- Three times to quit.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.516
That's so cute to think
of you in a pick-up truck.

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:15.552
- Are you ready?
- I love that.

01:19:15.652 --> 01:19:16.986
- What?
- You ready?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:20.023
Oh, Simon. This is Tracy.

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:21.925
- Hi.
- Yeah. Hi.

01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:25.061
Wait. Are you that actor?

01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:27.730
Wow. You were really great in this movie

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.300
that I used to watch
when I was really little.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:34.071
- What was it called?
- I don't know.

01:19:34.171 --> 01:19:37.441
You know, the one with the tarantula.

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:40.736
I've never made a
movie with a tarantula.

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:42.311
- Are you sure?
- No.

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:44.814
- Yes he was.
- Isn't she adorable?

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:46.420
Yeah.

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.118
Shall we?

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:52.388
Oh, actually,
we're having so much fun here.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.657
I can... could I get
a ride home from you?

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:57.360
- Yeah. Yes.
- With your truck? She has a truck.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.596
- I drive a truck.
- You can go on home if you want.

01:20:00.392 --> 01:20:03.664
I'll catch up later. We'll be fine.

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:31.327
- Hi.
- Hi, Simon.

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:33.630
Hi, girls. Have a nice time?

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:34.931
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:38.034
We had a really nice time.

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:40.170
Sure you did.

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:43.907
I was going to give Tracy
the grand tour of the house.

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:46.175
Oh. Be my guest.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:49.209
- Well, I want you to come.
- Yeah.

01:20:49.309 --> 01:20:51.349
- You know, go ahead.
- No.

01:20:51.449 --> 01:20:54.219
I don't know. I'm doing all right here.
Why don't you do it?

01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:57.554
- No, come. No, I want you to come.
- Yeah, all right. I will come.

01:20:57.654 --> 01:20:58.989
- Yay.
- Come this way.

01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:01.024
Go down this hallway.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.094
What are we going to do?

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:08.631
Take human playthings into our bed now?

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.422
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

01:21:11.522 --> 01:21:14.304
Come on. Don't be such a bore.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.304
Live a little.

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.050
Look, I have something for you.

01:21:58.782 --> 01:22:00.709
Hey, Simon.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.318
Still trying to think of
the name of that movie.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.524
What?

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:10.824
I was going to give Tracy
a tour of the house.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.262
Okay.

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.335
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:22.069
- Bye.
- Isn't this great?

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:26.243
Hello, Doc, hi.

01:22:26.343 --> 01:22:29.875
You'll never guess...
the turn of events.

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:33.583
Well...

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:36.218
she told me that she...

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:39.488
she wanted me to be
the father of her child.

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:42.325
I never heard you
talk about a child before.

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:46.563
I mean, Pegeen has been
planning our lives together.

01:22:46.663 --> 01:22:48.665
Are you sure that's
what she actually said?

01:22:48.765 --> 01:22:50.560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:53.770
I don't like the sound of this, Simon.

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:57.707
I want you to come in and see me
for a face to face session.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:01.700
To be honest, I find the inconsistencies
of what you're telling me

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.351
to be very disturbing. So, please,

01:23:05.451 --> 01:23:09.285
come by my office.
Don't neglect this, Simon.

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:12.238
I'm very concerned about you.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:16.259
I'm Simon Axler.
I'm having my sperm tested.

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:21.395
Well, this is dermatology.
Fertility is three flights up.

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:25.465
- Have a seat.
- Thank you very much.

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:29.019
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:23:29.706 --> 01:23:30.907
I got lost.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:33.476
That's okay.
You're under so much pressure.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:35.377
Yeah.

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:38.269
Well, here it is.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:41.671
You know, I'm closing in on 70.

01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:43.353
That's still young.

01:23:43.453 --> 01:23:47.459
When this child is 10,
I'll be pushing 80.

01:23:48.057 --> 01:23:50.894
Who knows, by that time...

01:23:51.094 --> 01:23:54.795
- I may not be your choice.
- You'll always be my choice.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.970
Yeah. Well...

01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:04.105
That's good to know.
That's really good to know.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:08.545
I'm going to be bald in a wheelchair

01:24:08.645 --> 01:24:12.048
with this spine of mine.
Believe me, I'll be in a wheelchair.

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:15.617
And then what? Probably dead.

01:24:17.019 --> 01:24:20.257
Maybe I'm not suited to be a father.

01:24:20.757 --> 01:24:22.372
Maybe...

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.092
it was too late.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:28.795
Another missed opportunity.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.903
I've missed so many in my life.

01:24:34.003 --> 01:24:37.805
You know, I missed everything.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.914
Gave up my life.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.812
You didn't. Here you are embracing life.

01:24:47.912 --> 01:24:50.635
We're going to have a baby,
and you're going to get back surgery,

01:24:50.735 --> 01:24:53.758
and we're going to be in love
for the rest of your life.

01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:57.594
I can't believe...

01:24:57.894 --> 01:24:59.896
that you're saying these things.
I mean...

01:24:59.996 --> 01:25:03.566
I mean, that everything...

01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:05.969
would come to this. I mean...

01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:09.003
Things would take on
this turn of events.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.578
Yeah.

01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:18.281
Well, here I am.

01:25:18.381 --> 01:25:20.950
Ready to go back to work,
resume my career,

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:23.712
and if all goes well today...

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.954
impregnate you. Right?

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.294
I am old now.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:39.469
And these same crosses...

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:41.736
spoil me.

01:25:44.505 --> 01:25:47.341
And these same crosses...

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.713
Hello?

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.650
Hello?

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:59.055
Who is this?

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:01.107
I want to say some things to you, Simon.

01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:04.294
- Carol?
- I want to say some things to you.

01:26:05.294 --> 01:26:06.995
- What?
- And then I want you to stay away

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.599
- from my daughter.
- Are you crazy?

01:26:09.699 --> 01:26:11.934
Carol, I'm rehearsing here.

01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:15.726
Do you have any idea what I'm
doing next week? I'm opening.

01:26:15.826 --> 01:26:18.508
Having trouble remembering
your lines, Simon?

01:26:19.308 --> 01:26:23.346
It's not surprising since... Why should
you be able to remember your lines

01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:25.912
when you can't even remember your life?

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:28.800
What's that supposed to mean?

01:26:28.901 --> 01:26:32.362
Do you remember what we were
doing the year before you and Asa

01:26:32.462 --> 01:26:35.079
did Godot in New Jersey?

01:26:36.092 --> 01:26:39.596
- We were doing a play.
- And Asa... what was Asa doing?

01:26:39.696 --> 01:26:42.665
- Asa?
- Asa, my husband, your friend.

01:26:42.765 --> 01:26:45.401
He was in the hospital.

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:47.203
And what were we doing, Simon?

01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:49.405
- We?
- You and I.

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:53.515
- We were doing a play.
- And what else?

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.245
What else? I don't know what else.

01:26:56.345 --> 01:26:59.757
- We were screwing, Simon.
- Okay.

01:26:59.857 --> 01:27:02.419
That's what we were doing.
We were screwing.

01:27:02.519 --> 01:27:05.054
Like rats or sailors.

01:27:05.154 --> 01:27:08.191
Okay. We were just... I mean...
I don't know. It was...

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:12.129
the play was one night.
We were drunk and...

01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:13.797
No, no. Eight times.

01:27:13.897 --> 01:27:15.665
- Eight times?
- Eight times.

01:27:15.765 --> 01:27:17.634
- You were counting?
- It's in my diary.

01:27:17.934 --> 01:27:21.034
Carol, this was decades ago.

01:27:21.134 --> 01:27:24.974
What are you talking about?
I mean, you know, the play was over.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:27.708
Yes, and we never
spoke about it, did we?

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:30.480
- No.
- No.

01:27:30.764 --> 01:27:34.150
And then I had the lovely
baby girl I always wanted.

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.884
And Asa and I were... we were all right.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.823
Yes. It was a happy ending.

01:27:41.023 --> 01:27:45.828
Except the lovely baby girl grew up
to be a rather eccentric creature.

01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:49.532
A confused creature with
some troublesome traits.

01:27:49.632 --> 01:27:51.765
You know, probably genetic.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:56.570
You should talk to her
father about that.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.945
- Bullshit.
- My God, you're dense.

01:28:03.045 --> 01:28:05.714
- Bullshit.
- You're so dense.

01:28:05.854 --> 01:28:09.452
You know, whenever people write about
what a brilliant observer you are,

01:28:09.552 --> 01:28:14.481
I tend to laugh hysterically. Have you
never, never noticed the similarities?

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.964
- I don't believe you.
- I'll send you her DNA.

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:25.700
God. It's such a shame that...

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.469
King Lear died of a broken heart.

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:31.207
What do you mean?

01:28:31.307 --> 01:28:35.210
Well, the ending could have been
so much more theatrical.

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:47.353
I knew you wouldn't have
the guts to do it yourself.

01:28:53.994 --> 01:28:55.654
Good work.

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.665
Good work.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:08.110
Simon, you okay?

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:10.246
Oh, yeah.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:12.212
That was good.

01:29:37.173 --> 01:29:39.871
Hello, this is Simon. Leave a message.

01:29:40.676 --> 01:29:42.511
Simon?

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:44.711
Simon, are you li...

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:47.816
Oh, man.

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:50.353
I can't believe this.

01:29:50.653 --> 01:29:53.222
They're waiting for the
freak to show up again.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:58.060
Stop reading that. Seriously,
put it away. Those guys are jerks.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.862
You're going to be amazing tomorrow.
Don't read those people.

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:10.273
And we, too...

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.715
I don't know the words.

01:30:13.376 --> 01:30:15.475
I don't know the words.

01:30:24.484 --> 01:30:26.542
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean what am I doing?

01:30:26.642 --> 01:30:28.175
What's...

01:30:29.558 --> 01:30:32.328
- What are you doing?
- I'm, like, five minutes late. Why are you mad?

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:34.630
This is... the car's been
waiting here for half an hour.

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:37.266
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.101
What'd you do with your hair?

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:41.375
I don't want to talk about it.
It doesn't matter.

01:30:41.475 --> 01:30:44.473
- But it looks different.
- Yeah, well...

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:50.713
It's not easy for me to go shopping
for this kind of dress alone.

01:30:50.813 --> 01:30:56.882
It's not easy for me to look into the mirror
and wonder if this is who I am now.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.591
Oh. So you choose this time
to have an identity crisis.

01:31:02.991 --> 01:31:04.793
- Yes.
- At this moment?

01:31:04.893 --> 01:31:07.263
- Yes.
- Well, that's thoughtful of you.

01:31:07.663 --> 01:31:12.835
Sybil Van Buren continues to express
disappointment with stage actor Simon Axler,

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:16.221
a friend, who, according to
Mrs. Van Buren, promised to help,

01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:18.107
but never quite came through.

01:31:18.257 --> 01:31:22.545
Mrs. Van Buren had accused her husband
of improper treatment of their daughter,

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:25.848
although she has never specified
what she meant by that.

01:31:25.948 --> 01:31:28.017
She has said she won't
give any further comment

01:31:28.117 --> 01:31:31.451
until she receives
a visit from Simon Axler.

01:31:32.509 --> 01:31:34.122
Simon? Simon?

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:37.994
Simon, please tell us, do you think
you'll be able to pull off this comeback...

01:31:38.094 --> 01:31:40.763
- ...after your emotional breakdown on stage?
- I got to get backstage. I'm sorry.

01:31:40.863 --> 01:31:43.332
- What's your relationship with Sybil Van Buren?
- I got to get backstage.

01:31:43.432 --> 01:31:46.790
How do you feel knowing that he may
be involved with another woman?

01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:50.673
Repeatedly shown disregard
for anything I want.

01:31:50.773 --> 01:31:52.074
What the hell do you mean by that?

01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:55.077
- Are you asking for an example?
- Sure.

01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:57.474
You brought that girl to my house.

01:31:58.074 --> 01:31:59.748
Did you consult me?

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.917
What, I'm supposed to ask
for your permission now?

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:05.754
Why don't you just suck the fun and
spontaneity out of everyone's life?

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:07.290
Permission?

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.425
You didn't even ask me what I thought.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:14.797
My opinion.
It's... the frustrating thing

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:18.534
is that I was so looking forward

01:32:18.634 --> 01:32:21.103
to sharing my news with you.

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:24.340
That's... that's what's frustrating.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.008
What news?

01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:28.108
"What news"?

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.894
That's what I mean.

01:32:32.994 --> 01:32:36.185
You know? That's what I...
You don't even remember.

01:32:36.285 --> 01:32:39.121
Remember? I had a surprise.

01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.223
What is it?

01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:43.926
Forget it. I... I... I...

01:32:44.026 --> 01:32:46.662
It's just not the right time.

01:32:46.762 --> 01:32:49.663
What is it?

01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:56.338
- I had my sperm tested.
- What the fuck?

01:32:56.508 --> 01:32:59.241
I can have a baby. I can have a child.

01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:02.075
- Oh, my God.
- I can have a baby.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.514
Are you kidding me?

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:12.388
No. What's going on? What is this?

01:33:12.488 --> 01:33:16.625
You gave me a pamphlet that tells
me that you can have a baby?

01:33:16.725 --> 01:33:18.393
No, it told me I could have a baby.

01:33:18.493 --> 01:33:22.531
- Where did you get this idea from?
- You. I mean you clearly wanted a child.

01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:25.234
No, I don't. I never said that.
I never said that.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:27.770
- You never said that?
- No.

01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:30.736
- Okay.
- I'm not ready. I don't want to.

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.877
Oh, well.

01:33:34.977 --> 01:33:37.713
You know, you are something.

01:33:38.013 --> 01:33:42.250
You know, I always thought
that you had it in you to be selfish.

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.453
- What?
- But this...

01:33:44.553 --> 01:33:48.182
This is, as they say,
it beats the clock.

01:33:48.282 --> 01:33:50.758
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me
right now with this shit?

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:53.527
- That's all you are is about yourself.
- You come to me with your fucking brochure

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.264
that tells you you can have babies,

01:33:55.364 --> 01:33:57.600
- I'm supposed to suddenly...
- The brochure doesn't tell me...

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:02.871
Fuck this. You know what? Fuck this.
I'm not going to be someone I'm not for you.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:06.702
- I'm done pretending to be that person.
- What was I? What was I? Was I an experiment?

01:34:06.802 --> 01:34:10.712
- I can't believe you're asking me this question.
- Was I some... some out-of-town try-out?

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.922
What was I? Oh, you're leaving?
Oh, that's great.

01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:16.018
- Yeah.
- That's great. It's my opening night.

01:34:16.618 --> 01:34:19.721
- Okay.
- I just can't... I just can't keep doing this.

01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:22.557
- I can't keep doing this act for you.
- I'm supposed to stop you from leaving now.

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:26.295
- Is that it? Don't go.
- No. Please don't stop me from leaving.

01:34:26.395 --> 01:34:29.131
I don't want you to stop me from
leaving because I'm leaving.

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:32.935
- No, you're not leaving. You can't do that.
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:36.238
- You're delusional. Seriously.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:39.641
Why? Because I turned you into something
that is close to being a woman?

01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:41.610
- Oh, my God. Fuck you.
- Okay.

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:44.212
- Fuck you and your show.
- Back at you. Back at you.

01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:46.248
You know what?
I don't even... it's not even...

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:49.851
- It's not worth it. Okay? Bye.
- It's not worth... Don't leave me. Pegeen.

01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:51.787
- What?
- Do not leave this theater!

01:34:51.987 --> 01:34:54.536
- You can't leave me.
- Yes, I can.

01:34:54.636 --> 01:34:56.795
You can't leave me! I'm opening tonight!

01:34:56.895 --> 01:34:59.200
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going out on stage!

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.309
I'm going to do King Lear!
I'm doing Shakespeare!

01:35:02.409 --> 01:35:03.965
- Did you ever hear about...
- Why are you yelling at me?

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:06.068
- Why are you yelling at me like this?
- William Shakespeare!

01:35:06.168 --> 01:35:08.738
- Oh, my God.
- I never want to see you again.

01:35:08.838 --> 01:35:11.807
- This... this...
- Bye. You are a destructive force!

01:35:11.907 --> 01:35:14.376
This is the most energy
I've ever seen you have,

01:35:14.476 --> 01:35:18.080
- so congratulations, use it for Lear.
- Why don't you go in front of the house,

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.449
in the audience
and you'll see real energy?

01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:23.752
I wouldn't waste it.
I keep it for the stage.

01:35:23.852 --> 01:35:26.522
I keep it for out there.
Go out there tonight and see me...

01:35:26.622 --> 01:35:29.825
- see me and you'll see real emotion.
- You just keep telling yourself that.

01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:31.894
- You know what? I am more...
- Real love!

01:35:31.994 --> 01:35:36.758
...than just a baby maker, by the by.
I am also a professor,

01:35:36.858 --> 01:35:39.055
- and a woman, and I don't give a shit...
- You're not a woman.

01:35:39.155 --> 01:35:43.271
- what your weird, old man needs are.
- You're a... you're a baby pony!

01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:45.707
- Oh, shut up, a baby pony?
- You're a furlong!

01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:48.076
That doesn't even make sense.
You know what?

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.846
- I can't even believe people...
- I'm blowing my voice!

01:35:50.946 --> 01:35:53.382
- I can't believe people are paying to watch you.
- I'm blowing my voice!

01:35:53.482 --> 01:35:55.750
I would pay someone to not...

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.823
- ...be with you ever again.
- You belong in a zoo!

01:35:57.923 --> 01:36:00.622
You know what?
Good luck with your great sperm.

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:04.115
Come back! Come back!

01:36:04.215 --> 01:36:06.659
Shane!

01:36:07.494 --> 01:36:11.364
Come back, Shane!

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:31.052
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:35.321
Let us away to prison.

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:40.151
We two alone...

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:44.199
will sing like birds in the cage.

01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:46.577
And...

01:36:46.977 --> 01:36:49.905
when thou dost ask of me blessing...

01:36:50.005 --> 01:36:55.244
I will kneel down and ask
of thee forgiveness.

01:36:55.444 --> 01:36:57.110
And...

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:03.282
so we'll live...

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.719
and pray...

01:37:08.356 --> 01:37:10.323
and sing...

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:14.060
and tell old tales...

01:37:16.464 --> 01:37:18.368
and laugh.

01:37:19.568 --> 01:37:21.351
And...

01:37:22.251 --> 01:37:24.673
we will take upon us

01:37:24.773 --> 01:37:27.643
the mystery of things

01:37:27.743 --> 01:37:30.844
as if we were God's spies.

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:38.659
And we'll wear out, in a walled prison,

01:37:38.759 --> 01:37:42.529
packs and sects of great ones...

01:37:42.791 --> 01:37:46.592
That ebb and flow by the moon.

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:54.801
We will take upon us
the mystery of things...

01:37:57.405 --> 01:38:00.473
as if we were God's spies.

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:08.627
A plague upon you, murderers...

01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:11.218
traitors all.

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:15.591
I might have saved her.

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:21.471
Now... Cordelia, stay a little.

01:38:22.298 --> 01:38:24.833
Her voice was ever soft,

01:38:25.133 --> 01:38:25.999
gentle...

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:32.939
Thou'lt come no more.

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.464
Oh...

01:38:38.764 --> 01:38:41.915
thou'lt come no more.

01:38:42.617 --> 01:38:44.343
Never,

01:38:44.443 --> 01:38:47.689
never, never...

01:38:47.789 --> 01:38:50.727
never, never,

01:38:50.827 --> 01:38:52.427
never.

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.677
I pray you, sir...

01:39:09.321 --> 01:39:11.611
undo this button.

01:39:18.553 --> 01:39:20.019
Thank you, sir.

01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:33.099
Do you see this?

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:37.903
Look on her...

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.577
Look...

01:39:42.377 --> 01:39:44.444
her lips.

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.049
Look there...

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:55.721
Look there.

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.032
That's not in the play.

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:12.875
This is who he is.
This is why he is who he is.

01:40:12.975 --> 01:40:14.608
No, he's dying.

01:40:16.843 --> 01:40:20.816
He's not dying. This is a genius.
You're looking at a genius.

01:40:20.916 --> 01:40:24.052
I'm telling you,
the genius is killing himself.

01:40:24.152 --> 01:40:28.490
There is no knife in this scene.
King Lear dies of grief.

01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:33.226
It doesn't matter.
He's taking it to a whole other level.

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:38.832
What the hell is going on here?

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:51.981
What comfort to this great decay
may come... shall be applied.

01:40:52.281 --> 01:40:54.416
For us, we will resign.

01:40:54.516 --> 01:40:59.184
During the life of this old majesty...
to him our absolute power.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.997
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:49.237
Yes! Yes!

01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:50.570
Bravo!

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.858
It's... it's okay.

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:12.494
My lord... My lord.

01:42:12.694 --> 01:42:16.598
- Look up, my lord.
- Vex not his ghost, oh, let him pass.

01:42:16.698 --> 01:42:18.133
He hates him much...

01:42:18.233 --> 01:42:22.805
that would upon the rack of this
rough world stretch him out longer.

01:42:23.305 --> 01:42:25.795
He is gone indeed.

01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:28.510
The wonder was he hath
endured so long...

01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:31.724
he but usurped his life.

01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:36.051
The weight of this
sad time we must obey.

01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:40.456
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

01:42:40.556 --> 01:42:43.859
The oldest hath borne most.
We that are young...

01:42:43.959 --> 01:42:48.317
shall never see so much,
nor live so long.
