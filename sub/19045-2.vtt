Okay. Just pull.
I'm tryin' to pull it, dude.

[ Dee ]
Pull harder, Dennis.
If I pull harder,

00:05.840 --> 00:07.039
it's gonna dig
into his leg.
Don't yell at me.

the shears farther down--
Jam 'em in there!

00:19.854 --> 00:22.388
You want the cast off?
That's what you wanted. That's
what you were asking for.

- You're not part of our gang.

You're not part
of the gang either, Dee,
so forget that.

Yes, I am.
You're not. The gang is me, Mac

- Dennis, let your sister
be part of the gang.
- She can't be part of the gang.

Is she part of the gang?

- Israel.

No, there's no Superdome.

20:01.166 --> 20:06.304
â™ª Then you wouldn't
have to say â™ª

20:06.306 --> 20:09.340
â™ª That you love me â™ª

20:09.342 --> 20:16.280
â™ª 'Cause I'd already know â™ª

20:16.282 --> 20:20.184
â™ª What would you do â™ª

20:20.186 --> 20:22.320
â™ª If I â™ªâ™ª
All right,
so this here...

20:22.322 --> 20:23.721
is the pillar
that I want to remove.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.857
I want to get this
out of here so there's
a nice wide open space...

20:26.859 --> 20:28.759
when people walk
into the bar.
What are you doing, Dad?

20:28.761 --> 20:32.830
In a second, Dennis.
And, uh, go into the bathroom.
Check out the fixtures.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.665
I'll be in in a second.
[ Scoffs ]

20:34.667 --> 20:38.436
What the hell's going on?
He's renovating my bar.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.738
- Your bar?
- Yeah, my bar.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.608
You see, the property
that I just purchased...

20:43.610 --> 20:47.878
extends from Morgan Street
all the way to right here.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.414
What the hell are you
talking about?
The property you bought?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.583
The building you blew up.
The building you set on fire.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.220
What'd you think,
I wasn't gonna find out
about that? Hmm!

20:56.222 --> 20:58.522
I'll give you two choices.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.658
I'm part of the gang...

21:00.660 --> 21:03.461
or I send your asses
to jail.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.130
I would rather go to jail
than work with you.
Yes!

21:06.132 --> 21:08.733
Just for the record,
I would rather not
spend my life in jail.

21:08.735 --> 21:12.136
I will tear this bar
to the ground.
I will kick the pillars in!

21:12.138 --> 21:13.771
Nobody's kicking anything.
She will kick
the pillars!

21:13.773 --> 21:17.608
- I will tear--
- Okay, here's what we're
gonna do! Everyone, relax.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.344
Frank, congratulations.
You're captain of the gang.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.313
[ Dee ] No! Charlie--
[ Dennis ]
Charlie, shut your mouth!

21:22.315 --> 21:25.349
Why can't you just die
and leave your money
to your kids...

21:25.351 --> 21:27.218
like normal parents
of America?

21:27.220 --> 21:31.422
- You sound like your mother.
- You say that to my face!

21:31.424 --> 21:34.692
- Excuse me.
- I will kick and tear--

21:34.694 --> 21:37.561
Excuse me!

21:37.563 --> 21:41.265
Thank you.
We're looking
for the owners.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.500
Oh. We're the owners.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.369
I'm Detective Tanner.
This here is Detective Volpe.

21:45.371 --> 21:49.407
Gentlemen, we're gonna
have to talk to you
for a moment.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.775
About what?

21:50.777 --> 21:55.880
You gentlemen know anything
about this?

21:57.649 --> 22:01.786
Uh--

22:01.788 --> 22:04.689
Oh,

22:04.691 --> 22:06.824
shit.
