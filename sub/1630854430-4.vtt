WEBVTT

00:09.643 --> 00:10.944
So, you a new driver?

00:10.944 --> 00:13.081
I just relocated
from New York.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.882
I went to New York once
in the '80s.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.617
- The heyday.
- Parents and I got mugged

00:16.617 --> 00:18.219
by a guy with a samurai sword.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.853
It's not for everybody.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.256
So, you're at the light
taking your driver's test,

00:22.256 --> 00:23.891
- and then...
- Down!

00:23.891 --> 00:25.559
You know we ran your name
through the system.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.828
- Then you know I'm a Leo.
- He's free to go.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.730
Part of a bigger investigation.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.066
What are you doing here
in Cow Patty, Oklahoma?

00:32.066 --> 00:35.403
Stopping bad guys from
blowing up our country.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.671
Tough day at the office.

00:37.671 --> 00:41.709
Tulsa is one of the ATF's
many versions of Siberia.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.045
What's that?
Look like "FR" to you?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.248
Place about five miles
from here.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.350
- Mrs. Fennario?
- Miss Devereaux.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.918
Car was stolen
and set on fire,

00:50.918 --> 00:53.020
and I found this
in the backseat.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.789
- I'm a private investigator.
- Right, and I'm an astronaut.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.591
Well, do you mind
if I ask around?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.960
On my property?
Yeah, I do mind.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.762
Fair enough.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.511
Oh, Ritchie, easy.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.648
Keep her under 160,
for Christ sake.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.683
Come on Manny, she ain't
even gonna break a sweat.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.752
She's got a baby race
in three days.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.888
I want a little sugar left
in the tank still come Saturday.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.291
Seems like you're gearing her
more for a hay ride.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.493
Yeah, well, it ain't you
getting ripped a new one

01:32.493 --> 01:35.028
if she goes flat
ahead of the stretch.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.031
Ten more minutes,
then cool her down.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.968
- You headed out?
- Yeah, I'll be back.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.171
Just got some shit
at home to deal with.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.773
<i>♪ I'm living
paycheck to paycheck ♪</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:48.676
<i>My money's all gone ♪</i>

02:04.558 --> 02:06.194
Hey, babe.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.396
I'm gonna swing by WinCo
after I drop the boys.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.731
You want anything?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.767
Thinks it's a fucking joke.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.336
Okay, well, don't complain

02:15.336 --> 02:17.605
when I don't remember
what cereal you wanted.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.907
- What?
- I'll be back in a bit.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.879
Motherfucking bastard.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.317
Fucking hit him.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.387
- Close the trunk.
- Jesus, I knew it.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.888
I fucking knew it.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.692
Get on your knees.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.731
I'm gonna say a name,

02:43.731 --> 02:45.599
and you're gonna answer me
yes or no.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.034
It's very simple. Chickie.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.002
Chickie?
What about Chickie?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.405
- Turn around.
- I don't...

02:51.405 --> 02:53.474
Better start talking
or I promise your brains

02:53.474 --> 02:55.376
are gonna be all over
this fucking kitchen.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.745
Chickie what?
I got no fucking idea

02:57.745 --> 02:59.347
what you're asking me.
Chickie what?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.249
Just tell me and
I'll tell you, please.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.452
Did he send you here
to kill me, yes or no?

03:04.452 --> 03:07.921
No! No, I haven't even
seen Chickie in over 20 years.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.258
- So, who hired you?
- Hired me?

03:10.258 --> 03:12.059
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.861
You gonna tell me
that wasn't you

03:13.861 --> 03:16.129
who tried to take me out
the other day?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.271
- Who sent you?
- You came here to kill me.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.573
What the fuck was I supposed
to do, wait?

03:25.573 --> 03:27.341
I got a wife, I got kids.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.677
When I saw you at the mall,
I figured Chickie's the one

03:29.677 --> 03:31.279
who sent you here to kill me.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.586
I got no beef with you, Dwight.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.589
Not you, not New York,
not fucking anybody.

03:41.589 --> 03:45.793
But Jesus Christ, why the fuck
else would you be in Tulsa?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.000
- Sugar?
- What?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.568
You got sugar?

03:55.536 --> 03:58.038
No, we have--
what do you call it, agave.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.442
- The fuck's that?
- No idea.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.312
So, let me get this right.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.716
I'm here in
the middle of nowhere,

04:08.716 --> 04:12.853
and just by some coincidence,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.988
you're here too,
and you try to shoot me

04:14.988 --> 04:17.591
because you think
I'm here to shoot you?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.427
Is that the line of defense
you're going with?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.962
On my kid's eyes,
I fucking swear,

04:21.962 --> 04:23.631
it's the Gods honest truth.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.067
My wife's gonna be home
any minute now.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.703
- She doesn't know anything.
- I'll leave a note.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.606
Tico Tavares.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.207
- What?
- Tico Tavares.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.577
- What about him?
- In prison, they set you up.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.546
I tried to warn you
but I couldn't get through.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.881
You said they tried
to set me up.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.650
- Who's they?
- Pete.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.352
My Pete?

04:44.352 --> 04:47.154
- You fucking liar.
- He was afraid you'd flipped.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.357
Fucking 25 years, come on.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.958
Nobody does that kind of time.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.893
- I did.
- I know you did,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.595
but most of these guys...

04:54.595 --> 04:57.898
I was afraid they'd kill me
because of what I knew.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.500
That's why I skipped town.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.136
I've been here 19 years, Dwight.
I built a life.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.506
Pete...

05:15.148 --> 05:17.117
You mow your lawn?

05:17.117 --> 05:20.988
- What?
- Do you mow your grass?

05:20.988 --> 05:24.091
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, I've never...

05:25.292 --> 05:28.762
mowed a lawn, never.
Not once in my entire life.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.631
You grew up in Brooklyn, so.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.767
Dwight, I'm sorry.
I didn't rat on anybody.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.438
I didn't want to hurt nobody.
I just wanted out.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.476
You know that
ain't the way it goes, right?

05:42.476 --> 05:45.513
Our thing,
25 years ago, Armand,

05:45.513 --> 05:48.449
you fucked up,

05:48.449 --> 05:52.085
and I went away for what became
a third of my life.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.422
And then you...

05:55.155 --> 05:57.224
tried to put
a bullet in my head.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.726
I-- I swear to God,

05:58.726 --> 06:01.294
- I was just trying...
- I'm talking.

06:02.430 --> 06:06.066
You work for me now, understand?
Like you always have.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.635
I expect an envelope
every Saturday.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.437
We'll start
at 300 bucks a week.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.905
Dwight, this ain't New York.
It's fucking Tulsa.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.874
I didn't tell you to move here.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.511
Of course,
the one time I am running late.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.215
I'll send over some sugar.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.456
Oh my God.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.539
You know
you're doing that wrong.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.808
Your form.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.114
Hey, pal.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.250
- Sorry.
- Buddy.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.552
The kettlebells.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.219
You're not lifting them right.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.221
Really?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.690
- Soft knees.
- Mm-hmm?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.825
You got to hinge your hips.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.128
Keep your body
in a standing plank position.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.198
- And lift.
- I'll tell you what.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.667
Let's make it interesting.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.168
You stand in front of me,

08:21.168 --> 08:24.638
and if I can't put
you to sleep with one swing,

08:24.638 --> 08:27.975
I'll donate a grand
to your favorite charity.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.209
Deal?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.612
Or should I go
back to doing it wrong?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.888
Blue Dome Haberdashery.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.223
Custom tailoring.
Let's try that.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.893
I wanna drop these suits off
to get altered.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.261
What the hell's that?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.998
It's a transponder.
For tolls.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.300
- It's like an easy pass.
- Get rid of it.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.135
They just gonna take a picture
of the license plate,

08:55.135 --> 08:56.336
send a bill in the mail.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.738
You don't get rid of that.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.840
I hope they get
my good side.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.945
Let's not make it
too easy for them.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.615
Let's see what we got here.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.850
- Okay.
- All right.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.853
You know, Kenny Rogers used to
shop here when he was in town.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.922
- Kenny who?
- Seriously?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.824
The guy's in the Hall of Fame.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.693
Know when to hold them.
Know when to fold them.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.161
Let's see what we got here.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.331
I seem to have
expanded a little bit.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.099
Can I be honest with you?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.235
We're in Tulsa.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.639
How about something
a little more modern?

09:31.639 --> 09:34.541
More in keeping
with the local style?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.846
A jacket like this
with a Stetson

09:38.846 --> 09:41.214
and a pair of Lucchese Boots,
hoo-wee,

09:41.214 --> 09:43.884
you would look
like a million bucks.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.452
There's alligators up
on that motherfucker, man.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.954
Yeah, it's an alligator.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.289
You can't turn that down,
it's got the alligators.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.091
Alligators don't work on this.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.727
Work your magic.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.663
- Just make them fit.
- Done.

09:55.663 --> 10:00.067
However, the man who only suits
himself has a fool for a tailor.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.335
- I've been called worse.
- You know, a couple Grammys ago,

10:02.335 --> 10:05.706
Puffy pulled up with
the paisley Dolce and Gabbana.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.942
You know you'd be
fly as shit in that, man?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.510
Can you step
a little bit closer?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.579
- Hey, what's up?
- Bang. Zoom.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.749
Thank you, Bert.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.759
Hey, look at this guy.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.295
Hm. What'd he do?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.398
- Nothing yet.
- What does that mean?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.566
What do you mean?

10:33.566 --> 10:36.203
- Is he a perp?
- No, he's on Tinder.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.038
Wow.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.573
So happy to see our hard earned
tax dollars at work.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.976
- Oh, you're not online?
- No, I'm not.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.444
Come on, it's not terrible.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.013
It's kind of like
panning for gold.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.580
Sometimes you find a nugget.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.016
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.551
I actually have to get
my dick picks in person.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.320
Oh, how's that going?

10:55.355 --> 10:58.358
Come on, Stacy,
you get out there a little bit.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.127
Yeah, I was out there recently.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.730
It didn't go great.
I'm fine.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.032
Hey, don't make me
worry about you.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.735
Any trouble
getting these things?

11:07.735 --> 11:10.003
Fuck no.
Nitrous is overseen

11:10.003 --> 11:11.739
by the Food and Drug Administration.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.975
Not exactly the agency that
strikes fear in one's heart.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.410
- Not exactly.
- No, right?

11:17.410 --> 11:18.912
Dwight, we ready?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.850
Tyson is on his way.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
You guys want
something to drink?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.619
- Yes.
- No, we're working.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.288
- Come on.
- Okay.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.424
Hey, Dwight,
you remember Bad Face?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.461
Yeah, the psycho neurotic
from the weed farm.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.063
Yeah.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.766
He's in town for the next
couple days making some drops.

11:39.566 --> 11:43.336
So, I thought maybe
you'd want to avoid him.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.273
No, no, no,
I got no issue with Bad Face.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.676
You gotta see this guy, he's
definitely off the reservation.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.111
- Who is he?
- He's a Creek Indian

11:51.111 --> 11:53.446
with a staring problem.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.416
- Serious staring problem.
- Sounds fun at parties.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.852
- Yeah, war parties.
- Ready to roll out?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.921
All right, throw that stuff
in the trunk

12:00.921 --> 12:02.555
and go out there
and make some money.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.925
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.994
Go get 'em kids.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.797
Fucking Bad Face.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.807
- Ice-cold patties.
- Here you go, that's 10 bucks.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.108
Hey, hold it at the tip,

12:21.108 --> 12:23.310
you gonna lose
all the good stuff, now.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.179
- Look at these motherfuckers.
- Business is booming.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.015
Oh, yeah.
You guys want a balloon?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.883
Who the fuck said
you could set up here?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.318
The parking lot?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.053
No, like, who gave you
permission to sell?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.454
Nobody gave us permission
to sell.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.123
'cause we ain't
asking for permission.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.490
This is our territory.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.392
You want to buy something?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.035
Bye-bye.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.852
Fifteen years
since I had my last drink,

13:04.852 --> 13:06.486
so thank you for that.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.691
Right before Devin
was born, yeah.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.630
- Will he kill us?
- Not you and the kids.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.167
- No.
- That's what Boise was about?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.675
So, what have you left us?

13:28.675 --> 13:31.611
What do you mean?
Like, the house? Life insurance?

13:31.611 --> 13:33.580
No, us. You and me.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.916
Because how am I supposed
to believe anything

13:35.916 --> 13:37.951
that you tell me
from this point out?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.452
'Cause you're a fucking liar, Manny.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.189
- Is that even really your name?
- It's Armand.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.224
- You know that.
- Do I?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.360
Oh, come on, would you
fucking stop, please, Clara?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.929
I'm sorry.
You're right.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.398
I should've told you everything
when we first met,

13:51.398 --> 13:54.301
about my past, but the further
down the line we got,

13:54.301 --> 13:57.037
the less necessary it felt.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.906
It was like
ancient history

13:58.906 --> 14:03.944
that I, frankly,
I wanted to forget.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.545
It's ugly.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.116
I know now.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.490
Now I do.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.515
How'd it go?

14:46.153 --> 14:47.454
We went through
all ten of the tanks.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.189
- Yeah.
- We could've sold more

14:49.189 --> 14:51.624
- if we had them.
- Laughing gas.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.260
Laughing all the way
to the bank, huh?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.395
Mm-hmm.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.997
Something going on tonight?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.265
Yeah, and tomorrow night, too.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.799
All right,
let's swing by Mitch's

14:59.799 --> 15:01.969
and pick up some more tanks.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.470
Here.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.306
Buy yourself
something pretty.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.543
I might get me
one of them rings.

15:12.845 --> 15:17.050
You know what?
This one has lost its luster.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.486
- Here, take it.
- You serious?

15:19.486 --> 15:21.254
Yeah, take it.
Come on, you earned it.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.822
Fuck.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.759
Wow.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.901
So...

15:37.037 --> 15:39.706
if I'm hearing right--
and lads, by all means,

15:39.706 --> 15:41.841
jump in and stop me
if you feel different.

15:41.841 --> 15:46.213
You and Davy here,
you just let them waltz on in.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.881
Come in,
come in and you let them

15:49.016 --> 15:51.018
take the food
right off our table.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.353
- Did I get that right?
- We didn't think it wise

15:53.353 --> 15:55.088
to start any shit without
checking with you first.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.589
Weak fucking links.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.194
They're unreliable, indecisive,

16:01.194 --> 16:03.596
and now revealed
to be total pussies.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.398
Weak fucking links.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.135
Easily exploited
by interloping hippies.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.671
I mean, who are we if we can't
protect what's ours?

16:13.073 --> 16:15.275
They've left us all exposed.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.776
This.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.780
It's no minor fuck up. No.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.518
This is a threat

16:25.518 --> 16:29.289
to our very existence.

16:47.074 --> 16:50.677
You interrupted
my breakfast for this?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.980
Dwight, it's an antique.
It's like 19th century.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.583
Pure copper.
You ever see <i>American Pickers?</i>

16:56.583 --> 16:58.318
People go crazy for this shit.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.554
Sure, what household couldn't
live without one of these?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.889
I'm just saying,
you could sell it,

17:02.889 --> 17:04.524
could be worth, like, 20 grand.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.293
- So, you sell it.
- I can't sell it,

17:06.293 --> 17:07.627
they'll know I stole it.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.597
If I sell it,
they'll think I stole it.

17:11.931 --> 17:15.635
I think shoveling horse shit
has affected your brain, Armand.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.737
Come on, Dwight, please.
I'm trying over here.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.973
I'm really trying.
Give me a break.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.510
Take it back there
before someone looks up

17:23.510 --> 17:25.478
and sees it's missing.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.749
Cash, Armand.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.252
I nearly broke my neck
getting that thing down.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.156
Fuck!

17:39.426 --> 17:40.993
When's the wedding?

17:42.195 --> 17:43.996
- What?
- Are you telling me that ain't

17:44.131 --> 17:45.765
an engagement ring
on your finger?

17:45.765 --> 17:49.836
Oh, you got-- you funny.
You got jokes today, right?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.739
It was-- it was my boss'.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.774
- What you mean "was"?
- He gave it to me

17:54.774 --> 17:57.210
to acknowledge the hard work
I've been putting in.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.612
As a chauffeur?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414
It's more than
a chauffeur, Dad, I'm--

18:01.414 --> 18:05.218
- I'm also like security, too.
- Protecting him from what?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.221
Whatever, you know,
he's a successful guy, you know.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.989
People get jealous of him.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.893
- This man a mobster?
- Mark.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.662
Why would you even
say something like that?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.930
Only two types of people
wear pinky rings--

18:17.930 --> 18:20.400
mobsters
and British aristocracy.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.602
And something tells me
your boss ain't no aristocrat.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.571
That's some real prejudiced shit
right there, I don't know...

18:24.571 --> 18:28.308
- Hey, language at my table.
- Mark, let the boy eat.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.076
Tyson knows right from wrong.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.383
- That a real diamond, Ty?
- Of course it is.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.052
Whatever you say, Dad.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.560
<i>Hello?</i>

18:47.560 --> 18:48.795
Jo, it's me.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.763
Christ, you sound old.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.999
<i>It's great
hearing your voice, too.</i>

18:54.534 --> 18:55.968
Twenty-five years.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.738
<i>What do you expect?</i>

19:04.677 --> 19:06.513
- I heard you called Tina?
- Yeah.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.381
<i>Well, if you're looking
for me to intervene,</i>

19:08.381 --> 19:10.683
<i>you're barking up
the wrong tree.</i>

19:10.683 --> 19:13.019
<i>I hardly ever see her myself.</i>

19:14.254 --> 19:16.556
Truth be told, I'm gonna see her
in a couple of hours.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.391
<i>Yeah?</i>

19:18.391 --> 19:21.661
That's-- that's nice, good.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.330
<i>It's Joe.</i>

19:25.565 --> 19:27.234
He's got lymphoma.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.504
And we all take turns
doing shifts.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.507
Should--should I come?

19:34.507 --> 19:37.043
What for?
Now?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.279
He's still my brother.
Our brother.

19:39.279 --> 19:43.416
What are you,
in some bullshit step program

19:43.416 --> 19:44.951
doing your apology tour?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.555
You want to stop busting
my balls for about five seconds?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.490
<i>So I'm gonna ask you again.</i>

19:50.490 --> 19:52.759
Why now?

19:52.759 --> 19:56.162
Honestly, I don't know.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.268
I don't know anything.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.504
You're a real fucking beaut,
you know that?

20:04.504 --> 20:08.441
<i>Radio silence for 25 years.</i>

20:11.311 --> 20:13.280
I'll keep you posted about Joe.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.857
Hey, heads up, y'all.
Hey, look,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.293
we told y'all motherfuckers
that we--

20:26.293 --> 20:27.760
Come on, man.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.967
Come on! Come on!

20:50.049 --> 20:53.052
I scheduled a Zoom
with a real estate agent...

20:53.886 --> 20:55.488
from Ocala, Florida.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.526
Oh yeah?
That's-- that's horse country.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.163
Yeah, I'm not
promising anything.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.599
It's just...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.370
worth a conversation,
that's all.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.548
Fucking unbelievable.

21:25.352 --> 21:31.358
So, these are the same guys
that said you needed permission?

21:31.358 --> 21:33.125
The guys from the other night?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.462
It was them,
and it was five other guys.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.729
Six.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.198
They took our tanks,
our cash, all of it.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.667
I'm so sorry about that, man.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.269
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.973
You held your ground, you lost.
Now it's time to regroup.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.643
- They say who they work for?
- No.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.581
No, but a couple of guys had

21:54.581 --> 21:58.217
Black Macadam
embroidered on their jackets.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.520
A local biker gang.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.857
- They anything?
- Well, they ain't nothing.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.394
All right,
so what we finna do?

22:07.394 --> 22:08.928
What are we gonna do?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.563
We're gonna do
the obvious thing.

22:10.563 --> 22:14.601
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna get our tanks,

22:14.601 --> 22:16.469
and then we're gonna get
our money.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.671
- I don't do violence.
- We're not doing violence.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.241
We're using our head.
You ever read <i>The Art of War?</i>

22:22.241 --> 22:23.643
Wouldn't you say that war

22:23.643 --> 22:25.878
falls under
the violence category here?

22:25.878 --> 22:32.218
Quote, "the greatest victories
are obtained without battle."

22:32.218 --> 22:35.622
End quote.
We're gonna use our heads.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.123
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.628
Fine, but I'm gonna
bring Bad Face just in case.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.998
Yeah, Dwight?

22:45.998 --> 22:47.767
<i>I need you
to meet me at seven tonight</i>

22:47.767 --> 22:49.469
<i>at the Bred-2-Buck.
You know it?</i>

22:49.469 --> 22:51.170
- What's up?
<i>- What's up?</i>

22:51.170 --> 22:52.872
<i>I'm giving you a chance
to pay back</i>

22:52.872 --> 22:54.340
<i>some of what you owe me.</i>

22:54.441 --> 22:56.443
No, no, no,
thank you, but...

22:56.443 --> 22:58.177
<i>Seven, Armand.</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:04.116
This is what I worked
my ass off for.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.453
- Send you to college.
- I just got into a fight, Dad.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.954
Bullshit.
This happened

23:07.954 --> 23:09.756
'cause you work
for that goddamn criminal.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.191
- Mark, we don't know that.
- No, maybe you don't know.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.894
But I do.
And Tyson sure does.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.729
Tell your mom Tyson, hm?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.731
Look in her eye
and lie to her face,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.467
'cause that's how
you do now, right?

23:20.467 --> 23:21.834
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.803
All right, so enlighten me.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.906
Enlighten me.
What was this big fight about?

23:31.711 --> 23:32.945
Hm?

23:32.945 --> 23:34.947
Is this your security work?

23:34.947 --> 23:36.516
'Cause if it is,
it looks to me

23:36.516 --> 23:38.050
like you're the one
need protecting.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.819
You always thinking
that I can't handle my own.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.554
Like I can't handle
any type of pressure...

23:41.554 --> 23:43.189
No, no, no, you don't get
to turn this

23:43.189 --> 23:44.557
into you're the victim.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.759
- Pick a lane, son.
- I tried, it's true.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.328
I tried to go to college.
My major was too imbecilic.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.864
Was I wrong?
You didn't even finish.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.601
Made nothing out of every
opportunity we provided you.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.870
- I'm trying, Dad.
- By driving some gangster's car?

23:57.870 --> 23:59.972
You're 25, Tyson.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.042
How long are your mother
and I supposed to wait

24:03.042 --> 24:05.077
before we see
a return on our investment?

24:05.077 --> 24:07.246
Oh, you want a return, huh?

24:07.246 --> 24:08.581
Oh, I got
a return for you.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.517
How about this?
How is that?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.685
- Tyson.
- You got five seconds

24:12.685 --> 24:16.523
to get your ass
and that out of my sight.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.529
Tyson.
Tyson!

24:33.540 --> 24:36.408
- That's catchy.
- Oh, just a little fiddling.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.848
Maisie's gonna cover for me.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.716
What time you think
we're gonna be back?

24:43.716 --> 24:45.317
From where?

24:45.317 --> 24:47.920
- From the concert.
- Aren't you on parole?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.989
You don't think you're going
without me, do you?

24:49.989 --> 24:53.459
No, no, you gotta stay here.
You're not getting busted.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.028
Work your magic behind the bar.
We got this.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.835
Hey, hey.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.571
Hey, haven't
seen you in a minute.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.673
Eh, I've mostly been drinking

25:06.673 --> 25:09.776
with my close friend,
the couch, lately.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.177
Trying to break the cycle.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.412
Happy to help you process.
Casamigos, rocks?

25:13.412 --> 25:14.947
Yes, please.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.850
Is it possible
to get that in a large size?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.919
Let me see
if I can find you a Big Gulp.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.728
Oh, thank you.
You are doing God's work.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.130
No need, your friend at the end
of the bar covered it.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.605
Order up!

25:40.673 --> 25:42.975
Dwight.
Where's Mitch?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.310
Why?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.613
I mean, you know,
it just feels like a bad omen.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.380
It's not a bad omen.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.517
I told you
this is gonna be surgical.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.053
Nonviolent, we're using
our head.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.622
Trust me on that.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.089
- Mr. D?
- Yeah.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.391
I ain't got a lot
of friends, so this means

25:59.391 --> 26:02.629
a lot to me that you've included
me in this beat down.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.731
<i>- Hoka hey.
- Hoka hey.</i>

26:04.731 --> 26:06.165
I'm ready to roll.
Let's get it cracking.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.300
- Got everything?
- It's already in the car.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.669
All right, let's do it.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.007
- Tyson.
- Oh, shit.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.976
Who's that?

26:16.976 --> 26:20.012
Just give me one second, Dwight.
Let me handle this real quick.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.814
What the hell are you doing?
Did you follow me here?

26:21.814 --> 26:24.784
No, I just set my GPS
to dumbass motherfucker.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.686
Dad, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.855
- You can see that, right?
- Which is what, exactly?

26:28.855 --> 26:30.990
- Wrap it up.
- Don't tell my son what to do.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.725
Whoa, whoa, chill, Dad.
Relax a little bit.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.727
Your son works for me.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.263
My boy is decent,
raised right.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.700
Your boy ain't a boy anymore,
he's a man.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.201
And like I said,
he works for me.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.770
- You coming or not?
- Dad, we...

26:43.770 --> 26:45.337
Who put that beating on my son?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.706
It's being taken care of.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.074
Is that where
you're off to now?

26:48.074 --> 26:49.909
- To take care of things?
- It's on the list.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.944
- Then I'm coming too.
- Dad, what do you mean?

26:51.944 --> 26:56.849
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

26:58.885 --> 27:02.088
And if this is the army
you're bringing into battle,

27:02.088 --> 27:05.424
then trust me, you need all
the friends you can get.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.427
He's serious.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.697
- You a father?
- Mm-mmm.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.098
Then why are you
asking questions

27:12.098 --> 27:13.800
you already know the answer to?

27:19.739 --> 27:21.841
Dwight.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.377
How you doing?
Mark.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.281
Let's hit it, Mark.
Come on!

27:31.918 --> 27:33.585
So, the New York girl
comes to Oklahoma

27:33.720 --> 27:35.187
to fight the bad guys.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.356
Yeah, just like
in the fairy tales.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.758
Mm.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.562
You're pretty.

27:47.599 --> 27:52.805
So, what's your story, Colton?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.874
What you see
is what you get.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.143
Oh, really?
Okay, yeah, well, what is that?

27:57.143 --> 28:00.112
- Good time with a good guy.
- Are you a good guy?

28:00.947 --> 28:02.448
I like to think I am.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.618
All right.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.220
Come on the show's
almost over.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.922
We should go on ahead in.
What's going on?

28:09.922 --> 28:12.358
Ashpet, let 'em collect
our money first.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.760
- Dwight?
- Yeah.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.294
There's twelve of them.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.996
That's my lucky fucking number.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.264
There's only eight of us.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.066
You seriously
counting yourself?

28:20.066 --> 28:21.868
Dwight, tell me you have a plan
that doesn't involve

28:21.868 --> 28:23.069
me getting punched
in the face again.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.771
I got a plan, relax.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.438
I'd like to propose something.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.606
Sure, Fred, what is it?

28:27.606 --> 28:28.941
Clint and I are gonna go in,

28:28.941 --> 28:30.342
rile 'em up,
start talking shit.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.979
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Shut up. All right.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.482
When they advance on us,
we give a signal, okay?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.785
Y'all come in from the flank
and you can take them out

28:38.785 --> 28:40.019
at the fucking knees, all right?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.821
- I like it, Fred.
- Right?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.255
- Yeah.
- No!

28:43.255 --> 28:45.491
Dwight, please tell me
you have an actual plan.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.426
The general's got a plan, Bodhi.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.511

31:53.879 --> 31:56.115
I'm afraid
this isn't the bonding moment

31:56.115 --> 31:57.783
you think it is, son.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.220
Mark.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.658
Thank you
for your participation.

32:06.658 --> 32:07.994
Here you go.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.401
All right.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.505
You always have a home, Tyson,

32:19.505 --> 32:22.441
unless you choose not to.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.810
So, make your choice.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.020
- Tonight was actually...
- Cathartic.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.027
I'm gonna head home,
if that's all right.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.394
Hold up.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.932
Should probably put that
towards what I owe you.

32:47.033 --> 32:50.636
No, no, no, here.
That's apples, this is oranges.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.374
Buy a new lawnmower.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.049
- Armand.
- Yes?

33:03.049 --> 33:04.950
Our arrangement still holds.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.098
Fuck.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.307
- Hey.
<i>- Hey. I'm sorry,</i>

33:28.307 --> 33:29.641
<i>I know it's really early.</i>

33:29.641 --> 33:32.078
No, it's okay.
I'm here, I'm fine.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.813
<i>If you want to talk to Joe,

33:34.813 --> 33:37.583
<i>- that you do it right now.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.821
- Can he talk?
<i>- No.</i>

33:42.821 --> 33:45.591
<i>But everyone's
on their way over.</i>

33:45.591 --> 33:49.195
<i>He's dying, Dwight.
He's shutting down.</i>

33:49.195 --> 33:52.731
<i>Our brother Joe is dying.</i>

33:54.766 --> 33:57.769
<i>He can hear us,
so you-- you just talk.</i>

33:57.769 --> 34:01.673
<i>And he squeezed my hand before
when I asked him</i>

34:01.673 --> 34:04.243
<i>if he wanted me
to call you.</i>

34:04.243 --> 34:08.714
<i>Just talk to him.
He's your little brother.</i>

34:08.714 --> 34:10.916
Okay.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.720
Hey, Joey.

34:15.821 --> 34:19.225
Joe.
It's your brother, Dwight.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.562
Hey, I'm sorry
you're not feeling good.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.499
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.839
I was thinking
the other day about Easter.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.243
You remember that time

34:37.243 --> 34:40.946
Pops had us pick up some
of those anise cookies?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.150
From Mrs. Milano?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.153
And I took that shortcut.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.490
There was-- there was this guy.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.627
He was heavy set, you know...

34:56.828 --> 35:00.766
dressed in white, you know,
white beard, white hair.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.968
Do you remember
what you asked him?

35:02.968 --> 35:05.904
<i>Yes. Look, he hears you.</i>

35:05.904 --> 35:08.874
You asked him if he was God.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.813
Remember what he said?

35:17.349 --> 35:20.652
We were both standing there,
looking at him like a mirage.

35:20.652 --> 35:25.724
And he said,
"Well, if you say I'm God,

35:27.259 --> 35:32.364
when you saw him,
then that's who he must be."

35:33.632 --> 35:35.066
Anyway...

35:37.403 --> 35:38.970
if you see this guy...

35:43.242 --> 35:44.843
I think he's okay.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.116
And I think
you should go with him.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.019
And...

35:55.787 --> 35:57.223
you and me...

36:00.826 --> 36:02.894
we'll catch up later, Joe.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.703
Manny, where the hell
have you been all night?

36:44.703 --> 36:47.439
Get back in the house.
Larry!

36:51.277 --> 36:53.312
Larry.

37:01.487 --> 37:05.557
<i>♪ I ain't gonna stop

37:05.557 --> 37:08.727

37:35.053 --> 37:36.822
I'm thinking about
dyeing my hair.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.325
- What color?
- Amber.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.062
So, do it.
Go ahead, be yourself.

37:44.062 --> 37:47.198
- Why not?
- Be myself.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.935
Be yourself.

37:49.935 --> 37:53.071
I like that.
Be myself.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.359
and I used to think about
the good old days...

38:14.593 --> 38:17.396
the good old days
were not really that good.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.367
Now, I realize what I missed--

38:22.100 --> 38:25.404
seeing my daughter grow up,
get married.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.374
And she did all that
without me protecting her.

protects the ones
they're responsible for.
