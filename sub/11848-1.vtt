You've always got to expect the unexpected and do the unexpected

12:03.557 --> 12:06.476

want to put on hurt you

12:07.603 --> 12:09.938

12:30.292 --> 12:31.376
You can take a branch of tree and manufacture a sling

Or you can pick up a short stick to get someone's eyes.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.301

they said it real bad lord, really

29:26.058 --> 29:27.392
Did you bring any candy?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.394
I like when they bring candy

29:30.020 --> 29:33.315

29:40.989 --> 29:41.990
your friend is pretty

29:42.699 --> 29:46.328
you must think you both special£¬
he didn't kill you like the last two

29:46.537 --> 29:48.247
they were bad girls

29:48.330 --> 29:49.873
kind of malicious,, you know

29:50.958 --> 29:52.960
I guess they all deserved it

29:54.086 --> 29:55.462
did you know what they did£¿

29:56.338 --> 29:59.132
they want to do sexy things with him

29:59.633 --> 30:03.095
they said they did anything he want
if he didn't hurt them

30:03.220 --> 30:05.138
but he doesn't want sexy things

30:05.472 --> 30:06.473
those things are bad

30:07.140 --> 30:09.434
You see so many bad things in your life

30:09.893 --> 30:11.895
It comes in through your eyes

30:12.521 --> 30:15.315
and sometimes your eyes lie to you

30:16.066 --> 30:18.402
and show you things you don't want to see

30:20.904 --> 30:22.823

31:18.295 --> 31:19.671
why he don't kill us£¿

31:21.006 --> 31:21.882

31:22.633 --> 31:24.760

31:26.345 --> 31:27.095
he might be busy

31:27.638 --> 31:31.099
after all£¬
he must move the cars miles away and dump them

31:31.350 --> 31:33.352
so no one can ever find us

31:34.603 --> 31:35.854
