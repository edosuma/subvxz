WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:07.590
{\an4}Motion sensor video games are
the future, and the future is
now.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.176
Calibrate robot
lobster claws.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.478
{\an1}FYI-- I'm pinching
your head off.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.731
Dad said
don't do that!

00:22.814 --> 00:26.025
{\an1}Can't hear you,
dancing on your corpse.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.195
Dad said don't
do that either!

00:29.279 --> 00:31.239
{\an1}Just tell me
what you got for him.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.281
You'll find out
tomorrow.

00:32.365 --> 00:36.119
{\an1}Excuse me-- dancing on
my brother's corpse here.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.078
{\an1}Shush!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.538
I'm trying to find out
what Stephanie got Dad

00:38.621 --> 00:40.457
{\an1}for their first
wedding anniversary.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.625
{\an1}I bet it's way better than
whatever he got for her.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.420
An anniversary is a moment
to celebrate love,

00:45.503 --> 00:46.671
not a competition.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
{\an1}But yours
is better, right?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.091
Uh, yeah!

00:51.217 --> 00:52.886
I bet Dad's
will be better.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.555
A few years ago Dad
got our mom a giant candle

00:55.638 --> 00:56.306
{\an3}shaped like
a mushroom.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.017
{\an1}That was their
last anniversary.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.104
{\an1}Dad, what's your anniversary
present for Stephanie?

01:03.188 --> 01:07.650
Number one,
she's standing right here.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.069
And, number two, definitely
not a mushroom candle.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.784
{\an4}Gabby's been trying to wheedle
the same thing out
of me all day.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.243
Stop being
so nosey.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.246
Anniversary gifts are
between a husband and a wife.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.706
But yours is
better, right?

01:21.790 --> 01:22.415
Uh, yeah!

01:22.499 --> 01:26.461
â™ª

01:53.446 --> 01:56.407
{\an8}Hi, hi, hi!

01:56.491 --> 01:58.535
{\an7}Charlie!

01:58.618 --> 02:01.162
{\an8}Oh, good, you're here.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.582
{\an8}I need to make sure that
you are not the average man.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.669
{\an7}You don't know me
like that.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.005
{\an8}The average man
does not know

02:11.089 --> 02:14.676
{\an8}what to get his wife
on her first anniversary.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.388
{\an8}Thank you, but I'm pretty sure I
got Stephanie the perfect gift.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.725
{\an8}The perfect gift
includes diamonds.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.855
{\an8}Does your gift include diamonds,
Charlie?

02:26.938 --> 02:27.981
{\an8}No, no, no.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.276
{\an8}The first anniversary gift
is traditionally paper.

02:31.359 --> 02:35.572
{\an8}Well, as long as that "paper" is
wrapped around some diamonds,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.867
{\an8}we're good.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.078
{\an8}Do you know what my husband
is doing for me?

02:42.161 --> 02:43.413
{\an8}Yes,
and I fixed it.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.748
What?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.458
He's driving all the way
to McMurray

02:47.542 --> 02:49.669
and getting me a giant
stuffed moose head.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.588
As long as that moose head
is stuffed with--

02:51.671 --> 02:55.758
{\an3}I get it!

02:55.842 --> 02:58.887
{\an1}My company is planning a party
with a Canadian theme.

02:58.970 --> 03:03.516
Guess I'll head for
the Great White North, eh?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.893
Bye.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.939
So, you're throwing
a moose party?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.232
There's no party.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.443
{\an1}That animal head warehouse
went out of business.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.694
You don't say?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.614
{\an1}I sent Charlie on
a wild moose chase.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.533
{\an1}I gotta get rid of him for the
day so that Vince can come over.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.951
{\an3}Vince?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.913
Good-looking
ex-boyfriend Vince?

03:24.996 --> 03:27.999
{\an1}No, a-long-long-time-ago
Vince.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.292
Well,
you know

03:29.375 --> 03:32.128
the first anniversary gift
is paper, not panky.

03:32.211 --> 03:36.758
{\an1}Mom, Vince is
a professional AV installer,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.135
who is putting in
a full-house system

03:39.218 --> 03:41.596
and giving me an incredible
price.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.600
Baby, nobody
does nothing for nothing.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.893
We are just
old friends--

03:46.976 --> 03:49.103
and, honestly, I am tired
of all of your negativity.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.481
(gasps)
Fine!

03:51.564 --> 03:54.651
You will not hear another
"negative" word from me.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.985
Great.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.365
{\an1}I'm positive Vince wants
to plug in your subwoofer!

04:03.201 --> 04:06.079
So, that's
the whole house.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.705
Not bad,
Mrs. Dr. Phillips.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.625
Oh, thank you.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.793
{\an1}Well, you do
your work,

04:11.876 --> 04:13.962
and the kids and I will
stay out of your hair.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.505
Look at you--
three kids?

04:16.589 --> 04:20.927
{\an1}You must be the hottest mom
in the carpool line.

04:21.010 --> 04:25.348
{\an1}A hot mom who wants
to give her husband a nice gift

04:25.431 --> 04:29.018
on our anniversary
of being married...

04:29.102 --> 04:30.019
{\an1}happily!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.522
All right, now,
don't rub it in.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.692
{\an1}But, hey, at least you are
giving me this one last chance.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.822
{\an1}Uh, one last chance
to... what?

04:40.905 --> 04:41.990
{\an3}You know!

04:42.073 --> 04:44.283
Get a little something for
myself out of all of this.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.413
{\an1}Hey, Steph, I--
Oh!

04:48.496 --> 04:51.124
{\an1}Wow.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.167
Um, Vince, this is
my stepdaughter Gabby

04:53.251 --> 04:57.964
from my sacred vows
of matrimony.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.549
{\an1}And, Gabby,
this is Vince,

04:59.632 --> 05:00.341
{\an1}who is putting in
a sound system

05:00.425 --> 05:03.511
{\an1}for your dad's
anniversary present.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.183
{\an1}(giggling nervously)
Well... I...

05:14.147 --> 05:15.773
{\an1}So, how's
it going--

05:15.857 --> 05:18.359
James, why is your
brother tied up...

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
{\an1}this time?

05:20.528 --> 05:21.988
I'm a human yoyo.

05:22.071 --> 05:22.488
{\an3}Check it.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.659
Okay, all right.

05:26.743 --> 05:31.247
How about you put the cable away
and let Vince do his work.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.206
{\an3}Can't.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.416
I'm his assistant.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.042
{\an5}(Vince)
James, insulated
long nose?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.043
{\an1}Insulated
long nose.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.046
Insulated
long nose.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.174
I'm subcontracting.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.259
These guys are the best crew
I've ever had.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.093
I found
my calling--

05:44.177 --> 05:46.846
electrical home
installations.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.600
Good news, I won't be needing
school anymore.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.393
I might still need
a little math.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.647
Vince is teaching me
wiring,

05:56.731 --> 05:58.775
and I'm teaching him
how to work six hours

05:58.858 --> 06:00.610
and charge
for 12.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.445
We're kinda
learning from each other.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.782
{\an1}Of course, sometimes
you charge for only parts,

06:05.865 --> 06:09.577
{\an1}'cause you're hoping the job
pays off in other ways.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.957
Well, would you look
at the time?

06:15.041 --> 06:18.461
My doctor husband's almost home
to continue our marriage.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.380
{\an1}Guess we better
get on it.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.257
{\an1}Let's go check
the intercom signal.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.926
Cool-- all my dad knows how
to do is heart transplants.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.304
Yeah,
who needs that?

06:32.558 --> 06:33.851
No negative.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.478
No sarcastic
positive,

06:35.561 --> 06:37.355
a double-negative still
counts as a negative,

06:37.438 --> 06:40.024
and don't even think about
a fake double-positive.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.570
(nickers)

06:44.654 --> 06:46.489
Oh, I get it.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.657
Now you're not saying
anything at all.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.119
{\an1}Mm-hmm!

06:51.202 --> 06:52.286
{\an3}Okay, fine.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.956
{\an1}I may have gotten myself
in over my head with Vince.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.541
Mm-hmm?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.959
I can cover it up.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.420
I mean, nobody else has to know
that Vince is my ex-boyfriend.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.215
{\an1}<i>Stephanie?</i>

07:04.298 --> 07:05.550
James?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.009
{\an1}<i>Vince got the intercom</i>
<i>working,</i>

07:07.093 --> 07:09.637
{\an1}<i>so we kind of heard</i>
<i>everything you just said.</i>

07:09.720 --> 07:11.556
"We?"

07:11.639 --> 07:13.850
{\an1}<i>Me, Gabby,</i>
<i>and Aaron.</i>

07:13.933 --> 07:15.560
{\an1}<i>(all)</i>
<i>Hi, Stephanie!</i>

07:22.984 --> 07:24.068
Three years
to college,

07:24.152 --> 07:27.363
three years to college,
three years to college.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.948
Everybody enjoying
their popsicles

07:29.031 --> 07:29.782
an hour
before dinner?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.160
You know it.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.369
What's the catch?

07:33.452 --> 07:34.370
{\an3}No catch.

07:34.453 --> 07:37.123
You don't want us
to tell Dad about Vince.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.167
And I'm willing
to pay.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.335
I just wanna hear
all about you and Vince.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.046
You can pay me in details,
girlfriend.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.674
There is
nothing to hear.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.051
That's why I don't want you
to tell your dad.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.386
Because
hearing about nothing

07:50.469 --> 07:52.138
can make you think
it's something.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.055
Gotcha.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.391
We'll talk when
the kids are in bed.

07:55.474 --> 07:57.059
Whatever.
James--

07:57.143 --> 07:59.687
{\an4}You had me
at "pay."

07:59.770 --> 08:02.023
Outstanding.

08:02.106 --> 08:05.776
But we'll need to
make it unanimous.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.239
Sorry, Stephanie,
I can't keep a secret.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.741
What are you
talking about?

08:11.824 --> 08:14.702
{\an1}You keep secrets from your dad
and me all the time.

08:14.785 --> 08:18.706
You kept a live squirrel
in your room for a week.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.418
And a dead one
for another week.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.295
I know,
but those are kid secrets.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.465
Keeping a grownup secret
freaks me out.

08:27.548 --> 08:31.260
Do it
without me.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.345
Do you not understand
what unanimous means?

08:32.428 --> 08:37.475
No, I was gonna ask,
but we went past it.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.769
{\an1}Stephanie, I'll help
Aaron keep this secret

08:39.852 --> 08:42.020
{\an1}if you pay me
his share.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.356
Deal.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.691
Don't worry, honey,
once Vince is gone,

08:45.775 --> 08:47.610
it won't even be
a secret anymore.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.571
This will all become something
that everybody forgets about.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.614
Like curfews.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.782
And homework.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.992
And that Vince is
Stephanie's boyfriend.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.717
Your loving husband
is home, triumphant.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.096
{\an3}Wow.

09:15.179 --> 09:19.350
{\an1}You're back with that moose
head I said I wanted.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.477
And it wasn't
easy to get.

09:21.560 --> 09:26.190
{\an1}That place you sent me to--
out of business.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.652
{\an1}But I went to the County Clerk
to locate the former owner,

09:29.735 --> 09:31.028
{\an1}had to drive another
three hours into the country,

09:31.112 --> 09:33.572
but I got it

09:33.656 --> 09:35.908
{\an1}and strapped it
to the roof.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.703
Almost hit a deer
on the way back.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.913
{\an1}Wouldn't that
have been ironic?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.332
Wow.

09:43.416 --> 09:43.958
Excellent work.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.294
Thank you.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.964
{\an1}So, while your father
was out hunting big game,

09:50.047 --> 09:51.257
how was your day?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.591
{\an1}Full of
surprises.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.511
Really?
Like what?

09:55.594 --> 09:57.013
Well,
Stephanie--

09:57.096 --> 09:59.682
Ow!

09:59.765 --> 10:00.099
{\an3}Oops,
sorry.

10:00.182 --> 10:03.102
Overshot it.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.937
{\an1}Okay.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.314
What's going on?

10:06.397 --> 10:08.107
(together)
Nothing.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.442
Stephanie
has a secret.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.737
It's not really
a secret.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.530
I'm gonna tell your dad
right after dinner.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.866
{\an1}You are?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.910
{\an1}Come on,
what is it?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.746
{\an1}Stephanie brought
this guy over--

10:21.829 --> 10:26.834
To put in a fancy sound system
for your anniversary present.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.212
Sound system?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.715
{\an1}I can't wait to go
push all the buttons!

10:32.798 --> 10:33.966
{\an1}Thank you,
sweetie.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.676
{\an1}I knew I married you
for a reason.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.554
Whew!

10:38.637 --> 10:40.306
That was touch-and-go
for a minute.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.684
{\an1}I know--
I almost blew it.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.562
{\an1}But it's all
over now.

10:46.645 --> 10:51.067
{\an5}(Charlie)
Let's get this
party started!

10:51.150 --> 10:54.111
(slow classical music
plays)

10:55.279 --> 10:58.240
{\an1}Yeah,
let's party!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.743
Like it's 1699.

11:01.994 --> 11:02.995
You still have
to tell me about Vince.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.122
Okay, later.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.085
{\an1}James, here is
your hush money.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.544
Pleasure doing
business with you.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.754
See you at your next
screw-up.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.050
{\an1}(Charlie on intercom)
<i>"Today I consider myself</i>

11:16.133 --> 11:17.343
<i>"the luckiest man</i>

11:17.426 --> 11:22.014
{\an1}<i>"on the face of</i>
<i>the earth... earth... earth."</i>

11:22.098 --> 11:24.308
<i>Honey, I'm already</i>
<i>thinking upgrades.</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:26.602
<i>You have got to get me</i>
<i>the number of the guy</i>

11:26.685 --> 11:28.521
<i>who put this in!</i>

11:29.563 --> 11:31.816
And here we are.

11:34.902 --> 11:39.907
{\an1}Steph, have I mentioned today
how much I love my gift?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.283
{\an1}And I'm gonna
love it even more

11:41.367 --> 11:45.621
{\an1}after Vince comes back to
install my kitchen flat screen.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.706
Maybe more Vince
is not a good idea.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.126
I mean, with his prices,
this stuff could be hot.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.210
{\an3}Like Vince.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.255
{\an1}(whispering)
Shut up.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.799
{\an1}Do you think he would put
speakers in my car?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.135
{\an1}I wanna see
my windows shake.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.929
Knock, knock.

12:02.012 --> 12:02.847
{\an6}Vince!

12:02.012 --> 12:02.847
Vince!

12:02.930 --> 12:04.557
I'm Charlie--
it's great to meet you.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.561
I love what you did
with my wife.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.189
With the
sound system.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.315
And I want more.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.483
A lot more.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.152
Follow me.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.528
Listen, we have the small flat
screen in my bedroom,

12:17.611 --> 12:20.739
but I like to sleep
on my side.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.285
Time to pay up.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.328
{\an1}I want the whole story
of you and Vince-

12:26.412 --> 12:28.998
{\an1}the romance, the passion,
the heartbreak.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.082
{\an1}Go.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.459
{\an3}Okay.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.626
{\an1}We met at a bar, we went out
for a couple of months,

12:32.710 --> 12:35.838
{\an5}but it didn't
work out.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.838
{\an1}Uh-uh.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.755
{\an1}If you don't want me
to tell Dad,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.675
{\an1}you're gonna have
to do better than that.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.134
{\an3}Fine.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.678
{\an3}You got me.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.681
It was summertime
in Vienna--

12:45.764 --> 12:47.016
{\an1}Europe,
so romantic.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.018
{\an3}Yep.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.354
I had just gotten a job
as a governess

12:52.438 --> 12:54.982
for a handsome widower
with seven kids.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.777
You took care
of seven kids?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.778
Yeah,
it was okay.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.029
We sang a lot.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.906
{\an1}Oh.

13:01.989 --> 13:02.239
{\an1}Get to
Vince.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.033
{\an3}Right.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.368
He was
a bike messenger,

13:06.452 --> 13:11.081
{\an1}who showed up every day with
a telegram just to see me.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.374
{\an1}Telegram?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.709
{\an1}That's a long
time ago.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.211
{\an1}How old
were you?

13:15.294 --> 13:19.882
I was 16,
going on 17.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.883
{\an1}Wait.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.928
{\an1}That's not you,
that's "The Sound of Music."

13:24.011 --> 13:25.054
{\an1}Hey, Dad!

13:25.137 --> 13:27.223
Gabby,
I am so sorry.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.891
I can't give you
what you want.

13:28.974 --> 13:29.558
We went out,
we split up.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.477
It wasn't
a great romance.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.146
{\an1}He broke your heart,
didn't he?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.147
{\an3}What?
No!

13:35.231 --> 13:37.274
He crushed you.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.651
{\an1}Of course, that
explains everything.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.653
No, Gabby, he did
not crush me.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.654
You poor thing.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.199
{\an1}I will keep your secret
to the grave.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.743
Then, yes,
he crushed me.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.745
I am
a broken soul.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.414
{\an1}Oh, it's good
to get it out, girlfriend.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.751
{\an1}That's how
you heal.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.421
Agh!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.382
Keeping secrets will make my
head feel like a balloon.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.593
No, a balloon animal.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.346
I know exactly
what you mean.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.889
Why couldn't you have given him
something simple

14:08.973 --> 14:10.057
like a mini horse?

14:10.140 --> 14:13.143
We could all know
about a mini horse.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
Aaron, sweetie, would
another popsicle help?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.856
Popsicles aren't always
the answer, Stephanie.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.860
But, yes,
please.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.782
(clears throat)

14:26.865 --> 14:29.118
I know,
I know.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
{\an1}Mm-hmm?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.831
{\an1}It's gonna be awkward,
but I gotta get rid of Vince.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.749
Mm-hmm!

14:37.418 --> 14:40.629
(clearing throat)

14:40.713 --> 14:42.214
{\an1}What?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.675
Mm-hmm.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.386
And you were right.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.472
Ah!

14:50.556 --> 14:53.642
(loud music playing)

14:56.228 --> 14:57.438
Feel that bass?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.772
Oh, I feel it,
Vince.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.025
{\an3}I feel it!

15:03.902 --> 15:05.487
Oh, babe, get in
the bed with us.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.449
You gotta
experience this!

15:08.532 --> 15:10.159
Oh, no, no, no.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.910
I-I'm good
right here.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.121
But, honey,
the boom-boom.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.084
{\an1}I take my break, and
you guys start without me?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.756
{\an1}I need to
talk to you.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.215
{\an3}About what?

15:25.299 --> 15:27.176
Honey, just try
the headphones.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.344
I wanna try
the headphones.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.804
{\an1}James, give the headphones
to your father.

15:30.888 --> 15:31.764
It's cool.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.973
{\an1}There's another pair
over there.

15:33.057 --> 15:33.974
Oh, okay.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.358
{\an1}Look, I need to ask you
for a huge favor.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.735
What, all this work for
nothing isn't enough?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.320
{\an1}No, that's
the favor.

15:46.403 --> 15:46.862
{\an1}Enough.

15:46.945 --> 15:47.863
{\an1}Finish up
and quit.

15:47.946 --> 15:51.659
{\an1}And if my family calls you
again, you're busy.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.243
{\an1}It is never going to
happen between you and me.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.037
Ow!

15:56.330 --> 15:58.540
{\an3}You and me?

15:58.624 --> 15:59.583
What are you
talking about?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.210
I'm married.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.544
I don't want you.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.422
I want
your husband.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.467
{\an1}I beg
your pardon?

16:08.550 --> 16:11.261
{\an1}To recommend me to all the
other doctors at the hospital.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.223
It's a huge,
new market for me.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.976
Oh, so you were
just "using" me?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.728
Say what,
Miss Below-cost?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.980
I'm sorry,
"Mrs." Below-cost.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.484
{\an1}Whoops.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.945
{\an1}Okay, um, how about
I recommend you

16:28.028 --> 16:30.906
{\an1}to all the doctors'
wives and girlfriends?

16:30.989 --> 16:35.828
{\an1}The same jobs, but we can put
a merciful end to this.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.205
Whoo!

16:44.795 --> 16:45.796
Bye, Gabby.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.130
It was great
meeting you.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.800
{\an3}Pig.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.884
{\an1}What?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.594
Off to break
someone else's heart?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.430
Stephanie
wasn't enough?

16:54.513 --> 16:55.097
{\an1}Huh?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.849
{\an1}Stephanie broke up
with me.

16:56.932 --> 16:57.808
{\an3}No way.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.895
She dumped you,
but married Dad?

17:01.979 --> 17:04.940
{\an1}He's mature, responsible,
thoughtful.

17:05.022 --> 17:08.068
{\an1}Me-- I'm just some guy
you meet in a club.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.490
I gotta start
going to clubs.

17:14.157 --> 17:14.782
Where's
my boss going?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.411
I'm supposed
to clock out.

17:17.493 --> 17:19.038
You clocked out when
I clocked your boss out.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.665
Does this mean I have to go
back to school?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.209
Because I might have
burned a few bridges.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.549
{\an6}Thank you.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.549
{\an1}Thank you.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.218
Charlie, everything
looks so good.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.180
{\an1}Why don't you order
for both of us?

17:36.263 --> 17:39.808
You can't read the menu without
your reading glasses, can you?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.269
{\an1}Oh,
all right.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.939
What's this?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.108
These aren't
my glasses.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.361
{\an1}It must be
your gift.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.864
Smooth,
Dr. Phillips.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.660
{\an1}First anniversary
is paper.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.080
Charlie, don't
play with me.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.541
{\an1}Read it,
read it.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.214
{\an3}Charlie.

18:10.297 --> 18:14.051
{\an1}This is the note I left
on your car when I dinged it.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.594
{\an1}Dinged?
Ha-ha.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.892
"Dear owner
of fancy car.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.478
"I am so sorry.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.148
"I tried to put
the headlight back in..."

18:30.442 --> 18:32.778
"Please don't report
this to my insurance

18:32.861 --> 18:36.031
{\an1}"because
I don't have any.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.574
"Here's my number.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.617
{\an1}"Thanks.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.037
"Stephanie Turner."

18:42.120 --> 18:44.540
Honey, this is
so romantic.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.208
I can't believe
you kept it.

18:46.291 --> 18:50.379
{\an1}Well, first,
it was evidence.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.714
{\an1}But then I fell
in love.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.341
{\an3}Oh.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.888
Charlie, I have
something to confess.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.558
I used to go out
with Vince.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.144
{\an1}My Vince?

19:06.770 --> 19:07.980
{\an3}Yes.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.232
But it was all over
years before I met you,

19:10.315 --> 19:11.942
and I only called him

19:12.025 --> 19:13.777
because I knew he would
give me a great discount.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.280
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
you told me.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.242
{\an1}But it's not
really that big of deal.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.119
{\an1}We both had lives before
we got married.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.371
Hey, I used to have
that wife, remember?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.250
Sometimes life
can be messy.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.044
But I'm confident in the
strength of our marriage,

19:31.128 --> 19:34.214
{\an1}and we should never feel
like our future

19:34.298 --> 19:36.425
is threatened
by our past.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.135
Wow, really?

19:39.052 --> 19:40.929
That is
so beautiful.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.265
Happy anniversary,
sweetie.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.391
Happy anniversary.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.646
Hey, you know that
steam shower you wanted?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.857
I used to go out with this
guy who can really--

19:51.940 --> 19:54.902
Absolutely not.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.113
Check this out.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.615
Picture
in picture

19:59.698 --> 20:02.075
in picture!

20:02.159 --> 20:03.160
{\an1}Wow!

20:03.243 --> 20:06.997
{\an1}I could watch three episodes
of "Sponge Bob" at once!

20:07.080 --> 20:09.708
The new guy did a real
good job with the system.

20:09.791 --> 20:13.128
Yeah, I'm just glad Stephanie
finally told you about Vince.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.965
Actually, buddy,
I already knew.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.343
Vince told me
as soon as we met.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.386
But don't tell
Stephanie.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.223
It'll be our
little secret.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.352
(screams)

20:31.897 --> 20:33.315
{\an8}â™ª
