WEBVTT

00:23.273 --> 00:25.859
We are, of course, missing Daniel LaRusso

00:25.942 --> 00:28.194
as current senseis
cannot serve on the board.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.321
But we have a lot to discuss.

00:30.905 --> 00:35.076
Last year's tournament was epic.
It's time to take it to the next level.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.287
We want to make sure
that karate in the Valley

00:37.787 --> 00:41.166
gets the respect
and the honor it deserves.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.086
Can we please just calm down
and keep this professional?

00:45.170 --> 00:48.923
-We cannot spend money we don't have.
-Enough of this bullshit!

00:49.007 --> 00:50.967
Oh, it might be bullshit to you,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.094
but some of us
actually care about tradition.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.763
Oh, don't go there again, George.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.849
Clearly the blue mats
led to a surge in attendance.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.018
-Come on!
-Why would we go back to red mats?

01:00.101 --> 01:04.272
As you can see, our core demo
are middle aged men and their sons.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.193
But we have seen an uptick
in young female interest.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.487
We need to speak to that audience.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.198
How about instead of karate
we put on a baking class?

01:13.281 --> 01:16.076
It's a wonder
you've been divorced three times, George.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.203
Ooh!

01:18.286 --> 01:21.456
I've said it in years past,
and I'll say it again.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.542
We have a vibrant
and active community of local celebrities.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.712
What about a grand marshal?
Or a musical performance?

01:27.796 --> 01:30.757
One of the dads on my son's fencing team,
he's a talent agent.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.010
Oh God. This is the Malcolm-Jamal Warner
debacle all over again.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.137
We all had egg on our faces that day.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.348
First of all, this is nothing like that.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.642
-I'd go through the proper channels--

01:40.725 --> 01:43.770
You couldn't get Louie Anderson
to show up for a free buffet, Ron.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.814
-You're out of order, Daryl.
-You're not a judge.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.524
-Why do I have this gavel?
-Not anymore.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.902
-Just put the gavel down.
-Drop this thing right now!

01:50.985 --> 01:51.903
You drop it!

01:58.576 --> 02:00.411
Let me get something straight.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.456
We're sanctioning an event
where boys are encouraged

02:03.540 --> 02:05.416
to kick and punch girls?

02:06.543 --> 02:11.297
Have any of you thought for a moment
this could be perceived as… problematic?

02:20.723 --> 02:24.769
Remember, this proposal
will revolutionize the tournament.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.729
This is our legacy.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.651
By a show of hands,
do we all agree on the changes?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.381
The motion passes by unanimous support.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.758
It's time to step into the future.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.678
Send out the letters.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.181
God help us all.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.148
Easy. Save some for Cobra Kai.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.358
If we're ever allowed to stand up to them.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.694


03:14.777 --> 03:17.113
Hey, everyone, gather round. I have news.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.075
The All Valley committee just announced
big changes for the tournament.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
What kind of changes?

03:22.577 --> 03:26.122
Well, see for yourself.
It's a whole new ball game.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.209
-They're introducing skills competitions?
-Yep.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.212
Kata, board breaking, weapons display?

03:32.295 --> 03:35.757
And there's gonna be
a separate girls' division. So that means…

03:35.840 --> 03:38.134
There'll be two All Valley champs.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.720
What does that mean
for the bet with Cobra Kai?

03:40.803 --> 03:44.557
There's a Grand Champion trophy
for whichever dojo wins the most points.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.726
All I know is the girls' division is mine.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.564
That just leaves the skills and the boys.
I'm counting on you guys.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.775
Who, us?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.194
Yeah, we're a bunch of Rudys.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.155
Sure, we're good
for the occasional inspirational moment,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.741
but we're not exactly center mat material.

04:01.824 --> 04:05.495
-We were better off with Miguel and Hawk.
-Or he who shall not be named.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.413
Rhymes with "Dobby."

04:08.081 --> 04:10.959
Look, I know
you're missing some of your friends.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.628
And of course I wish Robby was here.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.924
But it's time to put the past
behind us, all right? Don't worry.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.801
By the time the tournament comes around,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.470
you're gonna realize this was
the best thing that could've happened.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.349
This is the worst thing
that could've happened.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.601
Skills competition, bullshit.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.603
Kata isn't karate. It's dancing.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.856
What's this girls' division?
Thought they were all about women's lib.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.234
They ought to man up
and take a punch like the rest of us.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.903
Sensei, it sounds like
we could use some female students.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.571
Fine.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.491
Do any of you know any girls?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.495
Of course you don't.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.790
-There's this girl from the debate team.
-Debate team?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.459
We need killers, not more nerds.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.171
All right, go run some laps.
Maybe it'll jog your memories.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.008
Try not to breathe too much.
There's black mold in the corner.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.554
Look, Sensei, I-I know
things got heated at Miyagi-Do,

05:04.637 --> 05:08.182
but with these new changes, I think
having Sam on our team would really help.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.351
Maybe if you talk to Mr. LaRu--

05:10.435 --> 05:13.313
I have nothing to say to him.
We're better off without him.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.940
It's time for us
to take care of our own business.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.192
We'll find a girl champ, don't worry.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.029
-All right, now get running.
-Yeah.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.199
Ah, this is just--

05:25.283 --> 05:26.159
Perfect.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.413
First LaRusso
and Johnny Lawrence split, now this.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.498
Manna from heaven, baby.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.376
Neither have the fighters
to compete in both divisions.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.628
We're gonna win this tournament
before it even starts.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.798
-Where would you like this?
-What's all this?

05:41.382 --> 05:45.219
Top-of-the-line gear to go
with our new state-of-the-art equipment.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.597
These kids need to see
we settle for nothing but the best.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.015


05:49.098 --> 05:52.852
Now is the time
to show our strength and reinforce.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.771
May I?

05:55.813 --> 06:00.902
Cobra Kai is gonna be the only destination
for karate in the Valley.

06:00.985 --> 06:04.447
I want our logo on billboards, T-shirts--

06:04.530 --> 06:07.283
And on the backs
of both All Valley champions.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.535
Now we're talkin'.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.300
You're a hard girl to find.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.554
Avoiding your Auntie Kandace now,
sweetheart? Ignoring my calls?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.014
Yeah, what do you want?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.557
Well, to see you, of course.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.645
And to ask
if my sister's disability came in yet.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.148
What, need funding for another scam?
That money's for us.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.693
Come on. My sister always promised
to take care of me. She taught you better.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.987
She taught me
to recognize a low-class leech.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.031
Mind your manners.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.076
When your mom kicks the bucket,
who do you--

06:51.077 --> 06:53.371
Ooh. Quick temper.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.706
Just like your old man.

06:58.793 --> 07:04.006
When your mother passes… gracefully,
then what?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.843
You think your daddy's
just gonna show up out of the blue?

07:07.885 --> 07:08.970
I'm all you got.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.722
You don't give a shit about us.
You want her survivor benefits.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.101
I was at little Bobby's
fourth birthday party just last year.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.311
Brandon is eight.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.480
And next year I'll be 18.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.903
Hey. Who do you think's
gonna win a custody battle, huh?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.531
You're a high school dropout
and a criminal.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.325
-So are you.
-Yeah, but I know how to play the game.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.037
A judge is gonna take one look at you

07:35.121 --> 07:37.457
and laugh you straight outta court.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.293
See ya at the funeral, sweetheart.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.170
Tick tock.

07:48.759 --> 07:52.138
Okay. This is it. This is where
most of the girls' teams practice.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.267
-Sure you'll be able to convince 'em?
-Please.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.145
When I went to this school, the only thing
I was better at than karate,

07:59.228 --> 08:01.772
and I was pretty good at karate,
was talking to chicks.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.484
Watch and learn, Diaz. Watch and learn.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.196
Teen girls wanted.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.199
You gotta be under 18 or it's a no-go.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.036
No, not like that!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.539
Let me guess, posting photos on Facebook?

08:18.623 --> 08:20.708
You know what photos would look rad?

08:20.791 --> 08:23.002
A photo of you
kicking someone in the face.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.547
We meet out
at the old Webber Industrial warehouse.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.716
We're looking for badass chicks
just like you.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.759
An abandoned factory

08:29.842 --> 08:33.721
smack dab between the pipe supply
and the burned-down Chuck E. Cheese…

08:37.099 --> 08:40.061
-Trust me, the chicks are gonna love this.
-Hey, too much!

08:40.144 --> 08:42.021
You gotta get it into every groove.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.191
It's about molding highlights
to emphasize curvature.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.694
Hey, ladies, wanna work up a real sweat?
Where's your beach ball?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.030
Here's the beach ball.

08:51.739 --> 08:55.159
Try Eagle Fang Karate,
the most bitchin' dojo in the…

08:56.494 --> 08:57.328
Valley.

08:57.411 --> 09:01.082
And the best part is we have
a whole stable of hot young dudes,

09:01.165 --> 09:02.875
like my man Miguel over here.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.880
You like what you see?
He's not even in the top five.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.341
We got babes and everything,
whatever floats your boat.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.884
I'm asexual.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.971
All right, he's a sexual too.
Check him out. Total stud.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.308
So what do you say?
You ready to become an Eagle?

09:21.602 --> 09:24.772
I don't get it. I thought girls today
were supposed to be tough.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.653
-Why can't we find anyone for our team?
-Maybe not everyone needs karate.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.989
Especially girls
who are already on sports teams.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.699
Hey, Miguel.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.992
Hey, Moon, what's up?

09:36.075 --> 09:39.579
Some perv was creeping on the track team
so we're gonna practice inside.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.374
-What are you doing here?
-Recruiting for our new dojo.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.667
Eagle Fang Karate.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.253
Yeah. You know, you should join, actually.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.006
Really? Okay. Yeah, that sounds like fun.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.593
Wait. Do… Do I have to hit anyone?

09:53.676 --> 09:54.844
Hell yeah, you do.

09:55.469 --> 09:59.473
Oh, no, then I-I'm out. I… I can't do
the whole physical aggression thing.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.434
You should ask my ex.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.393
Hawk? Yeah--

10:02.476 --> 10:03.894
No, my… My other ex.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.607
She's the best athlete in school
and she's not afraid to get into a fight.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.443
Sounds like the badass babe
we've been looking for.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.446
Yeah, you might want
to take a different approach with her.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.448
Want some pointers?

10:16.115 --> 10:16.949
Absolutely.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.455
Hold on, I'm coming.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.711
Oh. So you're knocking this time.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.007
Mrs. LaRusso, I… need your help.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.386
Okay. Come on in.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.014
You remember the way?

10:43.434 --> 10:46.479
So the principal said
he'd consider letting me back into school

10:46.562 --> 10:48.564
because of my situation at home,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.691
but your family would have to sign off.

10:52.234 --> 10:56.155
Well, I'm glad
you wanna get your life back on track.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.908
Going back to school is a big step.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.372
-But I need you to promise me something.
-I'll stay away from Sam. I swear.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.540
That's great. But, um…

11:09.168 --> 11:10.711
I want you to get support.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.297
Talk to someone.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.841
You've been dealing with a lot.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.843
You have been. For a while.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.056
You should… talk to a therapist,
a guidance counselor,

11:22.139 --> 11:23.933
the Dalai Lama, it doesn't matter.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.936
Just someone who isn't karate related.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.980
I… Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.733
I need this.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.612
So today was a setback,
but the boys, they're gonna improve.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.823
You're gonna be fighting
lots of new opponents.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.533
-And--
-What?

11:40.616 --> 11:42.326
What the hell is she doing here?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.881
-Where the hell have you been?
-How'd you even get in here?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.843
Uh, your mom's left the key
under the gnome since kindergarten.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.721
You should think about
increasing the security given,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.222
you know, the karate war.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.975
-But that's not important now.
-What's so important?

12:06.058 --> 12:09.270
Didn't you hear? The All Valley
has separate gender divisions.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.773
I mean, do I look like Miyagi-Do's
best hope at defeating Robby Keene?

12:13.357 --> 12:17.528
I mean, Mr. LaRusso says that anyone
can be the hero, but I'm not Batman.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.904
I'm more like Alfred.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.197
You're Batman.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.871
Oh right, I forgot, you're not a DC guy.
Whatever. Forget Batman, you're the Hawk.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.166
Yeah, not anymore. So…

12:31.667 --> 12:34.628
Hey, at least it looks better
than the last time I saw it.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.632
Everyone at school knows what happened.
It's embarrassing.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.094
Who cares what they think?
Besides, it'll grow back.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.137
It doesn't matter.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.726
I ruined my reputation, talked a big game,
and just proved I was an asshole.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.896
To Moon, to Miguel,

12:51.979 --> 12:53.147
and especially you.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.066
I got what I deserved.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.779
Hey, I forgave you, remember?

12:59.862 --> 13:04.074
And I don't care
if you have a Mohawk, or a mullet,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.910
or pigtails,

13:06.410 --> 13:07.787
Miyagi-Do needs you.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.705
I'm not going back to Miyagi-Do.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.460
That's great. You're choosing Eagle Fang
over your best friend.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.212
I'm not going back to Eagle Fang either!

13:20.841 --> 13:22.259
I-I'm done with karate, man.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.513
I quit.

13:35.397 --> 13:39.151
-I mean, she's fast, she's strong…
-Girl's a natural Eagle.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.402
Oh, which one is yours?

13:41.237 --> 13:44.323
Well, that one looks good to me.
Haven't talked to her yet though.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.159
I'm still working on my approach.
Got any advice?

13:49.995 --> 13:53.374
-Okay, remember what Moon told you?
-Yes, I will be awake.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.917
Uh, no. No, no, no. Be woke.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.797
Hey, Piper. I wanted
to introduce you. This is--

13:59.880 --> 14:02.383
Sensei John Lawrence of Eagle Fang Karate.

14:02.967 --> 14:07.012
Let me tell you why my dojo is perfect
for a modern young woman like yourself.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.849
We live in a world
where you gotta be an alpha to survive.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.184
You're either a killer
or you're dead meat.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.310
You gotta be a man.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.357
At Eagle Fang we confront that phrase
and make it empowering for all.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.069
We teach anyone who identifies as female
to embrace their queenly strength

14:22.152 --> 14:26.240
and tear down the neo-masculine hierarchy
to confront internalized sexism.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.660
Sounds inclusive. But what about
non-binary and gender fluid?

14:29.743 --> 14:31.036
Yes, fluids are crucial.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.289
If you don't hydrate,
it affects performance.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.957
-And he's funny.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.877
Well, actually,
I have been meaning to join a dojo.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.337
I don't wanna be the last person
who doesn't know karate.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.423
Then today is your lucky day.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
Hey, Piper. Come check this out.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.223
-Okay, cool. I'll be there.
-All right.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.937
I can't believe you pulled that off. Did
you know what any of those terms meant?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.731
Do I look like I pee sitting down?

15:03.027 --> 15:06.363
What were you even thinking?
She didn't smash up the house enough?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.198
I know this is difficult, but--

15:08.282 --> 15:11.535
You wanted her to go to jail
and now you want her back in school?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.288
I don't want this rivalry
dominating your life anymore.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.373
Dad can't get along
with his high school rival

15:16.457 --> 15:19.335
and I'm supposed to go to school
and be best friends with a psycho?

15:19.418 --> 15:22.046
Johnny's and my differences
have nothing to do with--

15:22.129 --> 15:25.090
Yes, it does. Because you guys
just do whatever you want.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.344
You don't stop to think
that maybe I liked training with Johnny,

15:28.427 --> 15:30.471
or I don't wanna get
my face torn off again.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.973
As long as she's in school,
she has something to lose.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.600
She's not going to hurt you.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.851
You're just gonna believe her?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.355
You'll listen to what she has to say,
but nobody listens to what I have to say?

15:39.855 --> 15:40.689
God!

15:44.902 --> 15:47.196
-Thanks for the backup.
-Hey, Amanda.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.200
I mean, she has a point.
Why are you helping this girl?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.163
Did I tell you
about the time I was arrested?

15:57.122 --> 16:00.209
-Sure. What? It was a high school prank.
-Right.

16:00.292 --> 16:05.130
And by "prank," I meant I took
a baseball bat to my math tutor's car.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.758
With her in it.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.845
You… what? Why?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.264
She was having an affair with my dad.

16:16.350 --> 16:20.312
My parents' marriage was falling apart,
I thought the world was ending,

16:20.396 --> 16:23.065
and I blamed her
for taking it all away from me.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.154
I know you didn't get along
with your dad, but I did… I had no idea.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.866
I was charged
with misdemeanor reckless endangerment.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.577
I didn't walk my graduation.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.872
And then my parents divorced anyway.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.958
Why did you never tell me?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.044
Just worked hard to put it behind me.

16:45.796 --> 16:49.008
And it's not exactly a first date story.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
Or an any date story.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.850
I was young and upset.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.020
And I'm lucky it didn't ruin my life.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.106
Tory's young and upset.

17:05.524 --> 17:09.611
-And maybe she's a lost cause, but…
-We'll never know if we don't try to help.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.322
All I want to do
is try to break the pattern, Daniel.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.493
Kids like Tory get the same messages
delivered to them over and over again

17:16.577 --> 17:17.870
the same exact way.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.956
Sometimes they just need a wake-up call to

17:22.249 --> 17:23.375
change course.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.087
She's not the only one
who needs a wake-up call.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.134
You can't quit.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.678
I already told you, I made up my mind.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.016
Hey, you're the one
that got me into karate, remember?

17:40.350 --> 17:43.479
I was perfectly happy
playing <i>Dungeon Lord </i>after school,

17:43.562 --> 17:46.398
but you put me in a situation
where I had to join a dojo.

17:46.982 --> 17:47.983
And you know what?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.944
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.365
I got stronger, gained confidence,

17:55.449 --> 17:57.409
got the girl of my dreams…

17:57.493 --> 18:01.080
Even if she ends up leaving me
for some hot Aussie dude she meets there.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.500
Hell, I'm actually excited
about the All Valley tournament.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.627
I never thought I'd say that.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.588
But it's not gonna be as exciting
if you're not there.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.140
Okay, you're gonna make me do this.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.103
Excuse me…

18:24.978 --> 18:26.271
You said you deleted these.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.564
Oh, I say a lot of things.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.650
Which tends to be
a polarizing attribute of mine.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.549
-Why are you showing me these?
-Because this is who you are.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.217
A loser?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.468
My best friend.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.390
I know you think that
that Mohawk defined who you are,

19:02.015 --> 19:03.225
but it didn't.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.018
Not to me.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.105
Eli, Hawk…

19:08.605 --> 19:10.816
hell, call yourself Cornelius
for all I care.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.486
None of that changes the fact
that you're my Binary Brother.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.407
Whether you're number one, or a zero.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.128
What's up?

19:44.057 --> 19:44.892
Robby.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.645
Of course.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.315
-This'll only take a minute.
-I can save you that minute.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.109
You realized you're training
a bunch of wimps

19:54.193 --> 19:55.485
and you need a male champion.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.616
Let me guess, your sales pitch is,
"I'm here to rescue you."

20:00.699 --> 20:04.786
"This isn't who you are, Robby.
I can help." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.081
I've said all that before.
It's time to break the pattern.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.085
I heard what you did to Eli.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.131
-I just gave him what he deserved.
-I'm not here to judge you.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.509
I'm here to tell you
what's gonna happen to you next.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
Terry Silver popped up
out of the blue, right?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.973
He did the same thing to me.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.435
He'll seem decent enough,
show you a few moves,

20:28.518 --> 20:30.229
and then he'll worm his way in.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.232
Chip away at you.
And push you past your limits.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.984
You'll become stronger
than you thought possible,

20:36.652 --> 20:38.987
but Silver won't stop there. Okay?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.782
This man is sick and twisted,

20:41.865 --> 20:44.868
and when he's done with you,
you won't be you anymore.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.121
One day you'll find yourself
with some kid's blood all over your shirt

20:48.205 --> 20:50.582
and you'll hope
it's not too late to change course.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.709
He's not interested, Mr. LaRusso.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.714
New equipment just got in.
Why don't you go check it out?

21:10.769 --> 21:13.730
It's considered unethical
to poach students.

21:14.523 --> 21:18.735
You had your opportunity with Robby,
now he's with us. You should respect that.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.570
Respect. Res--

21:23.156 --> 21:24.574
You are not a sensei.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.119
You're a con man.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.539
Manipulating people to turn them
into something they're not.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.125
I didn't turn you
into anything, Danny Boy.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.961
I brought out what was already inside.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.088
That's bullshit. You tortured me.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.883
Please.
You were a hothead.

21:41.967 --> 21:46.513
All I had to do was wind you up
and get out of the way.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.015
And…

21:50.517 --> 21:52.477
if you're being honest with yourself,

21:54.187 --> 21:55.564
you know you liked it.

21:56.690 --> 22:00.193
You were powerful, free.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.824
You just don't wanna admit there's always
been a little Cobra Kai in you.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.619
We'll settle this on the mat.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.789
And when we win,

22:12.873 --> 22:16.501
Cobra Kai, and you,
will be out of business.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.421
One of us will be.

22:22.632 --> 22:26.136
If you're gonna use this place
as a conference room, buy something.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.600
T-Take your time.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.815
All right, so she's a little late,
no big deal. Just a few minutes.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.360
Uh, 20 minutes, actually.

22:43.236 --> 22:45.989
Okay, uh, look, I-I'll DM her.
See where she is.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.532
Okay…

22:51.411 --> 22:53.497
-Oh no.
-What?

22:53.580 --> 22:54.498
Uh…

23:00.420 --> 23:01.505
<i>Cool!</i>

23:01.588 --> 23:05.509
<i>Nothing but the best for the best.</i>
<i>Can't wait to kick ass with Cobra Kai.</i>

23:05.592 --> 23:07.344
She joined Cobra Kai?

23:08.178 --> 23:11.556
Uh, looks like they made designer gear
for all the new students.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.850
-They got a bunch of new recruits.
-Yeah, great.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.978
That was a big waste of time.
I even learned feminism.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.105
We can't give up.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.066
If we want first place,
we have to compete in the girls' division.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.069
With who? We don't have Cobra Kai's money.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.113
We have no chance at finding a champion.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.492
I wasn't a champion when you met me. Okay?

23:30.575 --> 23:32.828
You made me one,
saw something in me that no one else did.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.498
Maybe you just have to see that
in someone else.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.708
We just have to think outside of the box.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.548
Everybody start thinking outside the box!

23:46.591 --> 23:47.801
Whatever that means.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.205
Sam?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.040
Surprise?

24:21.793 --> 24:24.254
I can't believe
you drove all the way to Santa Barbara.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.882
I can't believe you live in Santa Barbara.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.468
-Your house is beautiful.
-Thanks.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.471
My dad got a job offer from UCSB
that he just couldn't pass up.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.266
Wait, so the fight at school
had nothing to do with it?

24:36.892 --> 24:40.312
Oh, it had plenty to do with it.
My parents were pissed.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.774
I broke a kid's nose.
Who knew these things were lethal weapons?

24:45.692 --> 24:48.153
You didn't drive two hours
to talk about the butts I've kicked.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.488
What's going on?

24:50.447 --> 24:53.909
It's just that Tory wants
to come back to West Valley.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.162
My parents want me to be cool about it.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.748
We're talking about
the same overprotective LaRussos

24:59.831 --> 25:02.167
who made me wear a helmet
on your trampoline?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.710
She sold them some sob story.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.341
I just feel like
I don't have control of my life.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.678
When I started my new school,

25:13.762 --> 25:17.224
there was this girl
in my homeroom, pink for days.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.851
Looked like she walked out
of a Malibu Barbie beach house.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.271
She gave me a look that I'd seen before.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.732
I just knew
she was gonna be my next bully.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.276
But I wasn't gonna let
the cycle repeat itself.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.904
So I walked up to her,
and you know what I did?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.698
Is this gonna be
another front wedgie story?

25:34.449 --> 25:35.659
I introduced myself.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.953
I told her I liked her shoes.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.914
I didn't, but it seemed
like the polite thing to do.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.377
I told her I was new,
asked if she could introduce me around.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.545
How did that go?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.296
She's my bestie.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.383
My new school bestie.
You'll always be the OG.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.262
I attacked my problem head on.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.222
I struck first.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.392
Just like Johnny taught you.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.853
My parents moved here
to get me away from the karate drama,

26:03.937 --> 26:07.315
but they can't stop me using the lessons
I learned from Sensei Lawrence.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.442
I set my own terms.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.527
Set yours.

26:18.034 --> 26:21.538
Capital punishment is a legal penalty
of the US state of California.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.872
As of March 2019,

26:22.956 --> 26:25.834
further executions are halted
by an official moratorium

26:25.917 --> 26:27.544
ordered by government officials.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.338
What are you doing here?
Debate was for nerds.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.591
It is. Which is why we're ditching it.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.844
You're right. I'm not giving up
on the girls' competition.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.805
-I'm thinking outside the box. Look.
-Okay.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.105
-Sensei, uh…
-You ever see the movie <i>Ladybugs?</i>

26:48.023 --> 26:50.233
I had to sit through it
with a babe, long story.

26:50.317 --> 26:53.069
Anyway, this coach,
the guy gets no respect,

26:53.153 --> 26:55.864
he's got this all-girls soccer team
that totally sucks.

26:55.947 --> 26:59.159
He gets his stepson to dress
like a chick and they start winning.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.913
-You want me to dress like a girl?
-What? No.

27:03.997 --> 27:07.334
I need you to win the boys' competition.
I'm thinking of Penis Breath.

27:07.417 --> 27:11.087
Not the best fighter, but he stands a shot
against the chicks. What do you think?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.674
A lot of things.
I don't know where to start.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.760
My opponent is full of crap.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.554
His evidence is garbage,
his arguments don't make sense,

27:19.638 --> 27:20.972
and I was bored to death.

27:21.556 --> 27:25.101
Which is ironic, considering
we're debating the death penalty.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.104
Uh, you're not gonna deduct points
for lack of decorum?

27:28.188 --> 27:29.522
Screw decorum.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.650
Wanna know what I really think
of the death penalty?

27:34.944 --> 27:36.196
-My book!

27:37.197 --> 27:38.156
Choke on it.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.534
I cede my time.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.207
Sensei, that's the girl I told you about.
She loves extracurriculars.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.124
Can it, Bert.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.004
I just found
the most badass girl in the Valley.

28:00.053 --> 28:03.556
Gentlemen, welcome
to the All Valley tournament.

28:04.724 --> 28:08.061
I know you've been in fights before,
but a tournament is different.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.021
There's no backup coming.

28:10.605 --> 28:14.401
It's just you,
on your own, in the spotlight,

28:14.484 --> 28:16.528
with the crowd cheering your name.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.446
Demetri, be the hero. Come on.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.534
The spotlight is yours.
Everyone you know is counting on you.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.745
-I'm the hero.
-Meat, Meat, Meat! Meat, Meat, Meat!

28:25.829 --> 28:28.873
-Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat!
-Ready?

28:28.957 --> 28:31.543
-Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat!
-Fight!

28:33.128 --> 28:34.421
Hi-yah!

28:40.135 --> 28:42.637
-Dammit!
-No! No. That was great.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.933
That kick was awesome, all right? You just
have to be careful you don't expose your--

28:47.892 --> 28:48.727
Well,

28:50.270 --> 28:51.980
look who decided to come back.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.694
It's good to see you, Eli.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.029
Or is it Hawk?

29:00.113 --> 29:03.992
Oh, doesn't matter. I'm just here
to do what I can to help out the team.

29:04.993 --> 29:05.869
That's good.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.329
The more help, the better.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.874
But first, you need a gi.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.377
Good to have you back, man.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.303
Oh, hey. I didn't know you were in here.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.555
I didn't want to interrupt your boys club.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.223
Hey, Sam.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.478
-About yesterday--
-No, Dad, it's fine.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.229
You and mom were right.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.107
It's time to leave
the past behind us, right?

29:37.025 --> 29:39.652
Yeah. I'm proud of you, Sam.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.697
It's never easy being the bigger person.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.288
Okay, you're good to go.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.214
It's her.

30:04.469 --> 30:08.056
I heard you let me back in, LaRusso.
So I guess I should--

30:08.139 --> 30:11.810
I don't know what game you're playing,
but I'm not scared of you.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.229
You're not in control here. I am.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.940
My parents might fall for your bullshit,

30:18.274 --> 30:22.904
but if you so much as look at me funny,
I will kick your ass for a third time.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.741
I'm coming for you, bitch.
