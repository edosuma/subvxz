What's your emergency?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.806
-Help me get her some air.
-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

Catch all-new episodes

We need your help,
even if we don't trust you.

Only on Fox.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.495
DISPATCHER:
Sir, are you there?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.399
Sir, can you hear me

00:31.432 --> 00:33.567
Sir?

00:41.209 --> 00:43.544
We've been here before.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.780
-Before you joined us, kid.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.719
-HEN: Chimney,

00:51.752 --> 00:53.354
you're almost there!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.955
Coming. Coming. Coming.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.759
Help me out here.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.428
All right, watch her head.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.664
Okay. Got it.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.903
Why would she do something
like this?

01:13.006 --> 01:15.376
I'm sorry.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.446
DANFORD: Whatever it was,
we could have talked about it.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.449
I could have helped her.
I loved her.

01:21.482 --> 01:25.119
I imagine she wasn't eager
to run into your loving arms.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.121
We had our differences.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.956
Clearly.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.762
Now, my wife liked to use
this tree for target practice.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.466
-DANFORD: I'm not gonna ask you
again.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.001
Where were you last night?
Do not walk away from me.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.437
Hey!

01:43.471 --> 01:45.473
You do this to yourself.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.441
You realize that?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.777
What do you want to hear, honey?

01:49.810 --> 01:52.646
Huh

01:52.680 --> 01:54.682
That I screwed his brains out
in the car?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.185
Will that make you feel better
for hitting me?

01:59.853 --> 02:01.189
Why would you get a gun?

02:01.222 --> 02:04.258
Don't take another step, Dan.
I will shoot you.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.494
I swear I will.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.230
Well, look at you.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.500
All brave.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.468
Oh, I'm not brave.

02:14.502 --> 02:18.839
I'm just so pissed
at myself for letting you

02:18.872 --> 02:21.375
rip me away from my life
and control me!

02:21.409 --> 02:23.377
Pull the trigger.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.613
Go ahead, pull the trigger.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.315
Shoot.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.350
Shoot, shoot, shoot! Damn it...

02:37.157 --> 02:39.059
You want out so bad,

02:39.092 --> 02:42.230
you're gonna have
to shoot yourself, not me.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.173
DANFORD:
Look.

02:53.207 --> 02:57.245
-It's still standing.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.580
And she's not.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.353
MAN:
I really can't explain it.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.556
Fungus took hold,
spread like cancer.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.158
Was she exposed
to any foreign objects?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.662
DANFORD: She got sick
after being struck by a bullet.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.665
MAN:
That's weird. Tree this size?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.166
Come on.
There's nothing you can do?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.935
MAN: Truth be told, she should
have been leveled months ago.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.737
It's a damn shame.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.539
A lot of good memories
with this tree.

03:25.573 --> 03:29.243
Well, I can get you an estimate
by the end of the day.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.944
Don't bother.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.393
*

04:21.695 --> 04:23.230
The bullet she fired at him...

04:23.263 --> 04:27.301
Did it fly out of the tree
when he blew it up?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.676
Karma's a bitch.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.814
*

04:44.552 --> 04:47.187
So I want to thank everybody
for donating today.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.289
I don't know
if you know this or not,

04:49.323 --> 04:51.859
but 90% of all the blood
given to patients

04:51.892 --> 04:55.128
in the Los Angeles area
comes from volunteers.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.831
I know that we all
put our asses on the line

04:57.865 --> 05:00.468
in the field every day
to save people,

05:00.501 --> 05:03.337
but today, you're saving people,

05:03.371 --> 05:06.106
and all it's taking is
a tiny prick of a needle.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.877
So simple, even Mr. Buckley
can't mess that up.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.380
How'd you do? -Incredible.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.182
Everyone donated. Some people
even came in on their day off.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.317
That's great. All right,
well, let's wrap it up.

05:17.351 --> 05:20.020
-We got to start our shift.
-Uh, hold up.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.356
Looks here
like I am two pints shy

05:22.390 --> 05:24.024
of my goal for the day.

05:24.057 --> 05:28.228
Well, that'll give you something
to work towards next time.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're
the captain of this house,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.333
and you're the only one
who didn't participate.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.235
I don't like needles,
end of story.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.805
Oh, come on.
Captain, come on.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.073
You got to donate.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.376
I don't give blood.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.645
All right? I never give blood.
When I was a kid,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.980
they tried to take my blood,
and I bit the doctor.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.549
-It's not funny.

05:48.582 --> 05:52.052
And the one time someone tried
to take my blood as an adult...

05:54.522 --> 05:56.524
...didn't go well.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.394
Bobby? Bobby, hold...
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.997
All right, listen, I get it.
I really do, okay?

06:04.031 --> 06:07.668
But I really need you
to do this for me, all right?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.437
Look...

06:09.470 --> 06:13.874
I'm alive because that rebar hit
my head at just the right angle,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.544
and because I had the best damn
fire and rescue team

06:16.577 --> 06:18.045
to get me to the hospital

06:18.078 --> 06:20.347
and the best surgeons
in the world once I got there.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.551
But I got ten pints of blood,
donated blood,

06:23.584 --> 06:26.386
given by the very generous
people of this city.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.921
Now, I told you, I just...

06:27.955 --> 06:30.891
I wanted to do this blood drive
'cause I wanted to give

06:30.924 --> 06:32.893
a little something back
of what I was given.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.295
And expressing my gratitude
like this--

06:35.328 --> 06:37.531
it balances me out
with the universe.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.033
Now, you and everybody else here

06:40.067 --> 06:42.736
asked me how they could help
with my recovery.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.905
Well, this is how.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.213
-I hate all of you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.148
-You love us.
-Here, you're gonna need this.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.452
-Just squeeze it. -CHIMNEY:
All right, let's stick him!

07:00.020 --> 07:02.490
All right, let's get it.

07:04.357 --> 07:08.261
Hey. All right,
get in there. Get in there.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.830
-There you go.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.364
Mwah.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.586
-Hey.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.354
I am proud of us.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.991
What we're trying
to do here-- I tell you.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.794
And what is it exactly
we trying to do?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.863
Because I keep forgetting.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.799
Well, be a family,
for better or worse.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.536
Adapt to our circumstance.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.804
You know, everyone says that

07:50.838 --> 07:54.875
they put their kids first,
but we are actually doing it.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.611
I want to take the kids out
this weekend.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.212
-Yeah.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.515
Please. We've already
taken them to your mother's.

08:01.549 --> 08:05.519
Athena, I've been seeing
Glenn now for some time,

08:05.553 --> 08:08.989
and I want the kids to meet him.
I-I want you to meet him.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.491
Absolutely not.
They say you should wait a year

08:11.525 --> 08:13.527
before you introduce
your kids to someone,

08:13.561 --> 08:16.229
and that's under
the best of circumstances.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.999
What, you think they're ready
to see you sitting at dinner

08:19.032 --> 08:21.001
holding hands with another man?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.737
Well, they need
to see me for who I am.

08:23.771 --> 08:27.074
Says who? Look, I know you're
ready to come out and change

08:27.107 --> 08:29.409
your whole world,
but the rest of us aren't.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.179
God, it's not like
he's moving in.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.347
You know, I just thought
that if we all go out

08:34.381 --> 08:36.316
for ice cream
and maybe have a conversation...

08:36.349 --> 08:39.152
And then what? Is he coming over
for Sunday dinner?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.388
Opening presents
under the Christmas tree?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.857
-He's a stranger to us.
-So I guess you want

08:43.891 --> 08:46.026
to have a background check
before he's around the kids?

08:46.059 --> 08:48.361
Couldn't hurt.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.867
I met him
on the Wilshire project.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.769
He's a contractor.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.672
Went to USC. He's decent.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.842
Barely drinks.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.678
Doesn't smoke, no drugs.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.547
And I am hoping

09:07.581 --> 09:10.250
that's he's not a stranger
for long.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.722
We agreed that
this family would change shape,

09:14.755 --> 09:17.257
and that we would work together

09:17.290 --> 09:20.928
to mold it into something
that works for all of us.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.565
I'm trying to move forward,
Athena.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.367
Move with me.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.104
Then stop moving so fast.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.923
Okay, so I came in early
to turn in my keys

09:49.957 --> 09:51.458
and-and pick up my paycheck.

09:51.491 --> 09:55.262
He actually fired me yesterday.
It's a whole story.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.666
Anyway, I, um...
I smelled something burning.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.640
We all kept trying to tell him
to get it fixed.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.911
Oh, my God.
I didn't think to do that.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.613
-I don't know. He's the owner,

10:13.647 --> 10:16.784
so sometimes he comes in before
we even open, so two hours,

10:16.817 --> 10:19.119
-What do you
think, Chim

10:19.152 --> 10:21.288
Worse. I think he's alive.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.290
Why the hell
didn't he just get out?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.292
-Might have had a stroke.
-He's 32.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.961
We need to know. -I don't know.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.530
32, may have had a stoke; drugs
could be an underlying cause.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.335
-He was stacking.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.973
He's in V-tach!

10:40.007 --> 10:42.676
Starting compressions.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.317
CHIMNEY:
No. He's gone.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.953
-Oh, my God.
-Whoa, whoa. Easy.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.488
It's just too freaky. I mean,
after what happened with Mindy.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.726
I told him. I said, "Barry,
what goes around comes around."

10:58.759 --> 11:00.527
Who's Mindy?

11:00.560 --> 11:03.196
(rock music playing
over truck stereo)

11:10.237 --> 11:11.739
-Barry. Hey.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.673
-You can't leave Mindy in there.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.508
No, I won't be long.
I'm just doing chest.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.845
-She's fine. I cracked the
window. -Barry, it's not enough.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.013
Why did you even bring her? Why
didn't you just leave her home?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.248
'Cause you know
how hyper she gets.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.183
She barks all day.
The neighbors have complained.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.219
-I'm not supposed to have a dog.
-Barry, she is gonna bake.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.687
It's 70 degrees out.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.557
PETA says on a 70 degree day,
temperatures inside a parked car

11:30.590 --> 11:32.860
-can reach a hundred.
-Carrie, she's fine.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.862
-She's got water. -Barry,
dogs can die from heatstroke.

11:34.895 --> 11:38.698
And she's not your dog. You're
supposed to be behind the desk.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.743
* I always cross the line

11:49.777 --> 11:51.378
* Tightened our belts

11:51.411 --> 11:53.413
* Abuse ourselves

11:53.446 --> 11:55.548
* Get in our way...

11:55.582 --> 11:58.385
Carrie.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.087
What are you doing?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.721
The tanning bed's
fritzing again.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.056
The timer's stuck.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.192
No. I told you there's
nothing wrong with it.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.594
You just got to jiggle it.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.600
Oh.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.602
* What comes around
goes around. *

12:17.437 --> 12:20.707
No, no, no.
What the hell did you do?!

12:20.740 --> 12:23.310
I saved your dog.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.279
Here. You're welcome.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.647
You know what?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.083
You come pick up your final
paycheck tomorrow morning.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.451
You're fired!

12:36.289 --> 12:39.960
-Yep. Karma's a bi...
-Please, don't.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.265
This is Bobby.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.976
I-I don't understand
why you can't just tell...

12:56.009 --> 12:58.111
-Okay, thanks.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.580
That was Cedars.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.915
Is someone sick?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.183
The blood I donated--

13:03.216 --> 13:04.985
they sent it to a lab
and had it tested, so...

13:05.018 --> 13:07.420
Well, it's the first time you
donated; they have to do that

13:07.454 --> 13:09.022
before they release it
to the blood supply.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.157
They found something in it.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.659
What do you mean,
"found something"?

13:12.692 --> 13:13.927
They wouldn't tell me
over the phone.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.396
They said they'd rather do it
in person.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.976
BOBBY: I got to show you
something, Father.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.945
I haven't shared this
with anyone else.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.514
Your prayer book?

13:34.547 --> 13:37.717
I guess it is my prayer book
in a way.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.721
A list of names.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.156
62, so far.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.226
62 of 148.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.328
One hundred and forty-eight.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.630
The number of people who died
because of me.

13:50.663 --> 13:55.002
These 62 names, these are people
whose lives you've saved.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.937
Yeah.

13:58.738 --> 14:03.476
This job, it's the only way I
know how to balance the ledger.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.880
Not that I can ever
really do that.

14:06.914 --> 14:10.550
But 148 lives,
I owe at least that much.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.721
And then I can go.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.262
Bobby, you're aware of the
Church's position on suicide.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.932
-You're against it. -It would
cost you your eternal soul.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.701
-I believe in God's justice.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.539
How about his sense of humor?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.008
There's something in my blood.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.776
Something unusual.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.746
The doctor wouldn't tell me
over the phone.

14:39.779 --> 14:43.283
-He wants to break it to me
in person. -I'm sorry.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.352
So I guess the irony is,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.787
I may not live long enough
to make it to 148,

14:47.820 --> 14:50.457
and that scares the hell
out of me.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.192
Because that is your penance.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.528
And I don't know if my soul will
ever be able to rest in peace

14:55.562 --> 14:57.897
if it goes unpaid.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.934
("Instant Karma"
by John Lennon playing)

15:02.769 --> 15:05.272
* Instant karma's
gonna get you *

15:06.573 --> 15:08.641
* Gonna knock you
right in the head *

15:10.510 --> 15:14.081
* You better get yourself
together *

15:14.114 --> 15:18.085
* Pretty soon
you're gonna be dead *

15:18.118 --> 15:22.422
* What in the world
you thinking of? *

15:22.455 --> 15:26.659
* Laughing in the face of love

15:26.693 --> 15:29.596

you trying to do? *

15:29.629 --> 15:32.099

16:12.372 --> 16:14.507
Ow!

16:32.592 --> 16:34.694
I hope nothing was breakable
in your package.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.363
I don't know.
I'm sure it's fine.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.231
Not that you couldn't return it,
but the hassle, you know.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.900
Just get me to the hospital.
Why aren't we leaving?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.635
We're just not sure if you have
a spinal cord injury,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.871
-and so we're trying to
stabilize you. -I told you,

16:44.904 --> 16:46.206
I can feel my legs.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.475
I can feel it too much.
It hurts!

16:51.578 --> 16:53.313
The cops don't need to be here.
I'm fine.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.048
I-I don't want to go
to the hospital.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.816
You guys find I.D. on her?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.052
Uh...

16:59.086 --> 17:01.588
This must have fallen out of
her pocket. Who called you?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.390
One of the neighbors.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.896
Are you trying
to suggest that I'm...

17:09.929 --> 17:11.998
There are days when I'd actually
enjoy whatever tall tale

17:12.031 --> 17:13.766
you're on the cusp
of spitting my way.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.435
Where I'd be entertained
letting you think

17:15.468 --> 17:18.538
that you're smarter than me,
even if only for a minute.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.673
But today is nowhere close
to being one of them.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.875
I'm the victim here.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.878
-I have to get to the hospital.
-Oh, you'll get there.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.081
-They'll fix your busted hip.
-Femur, actually.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.383
And then you'll be charged
with grand theft.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.120
-Trespassing, too.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.287
Oh.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.755
Your car is still running.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.126
Your driver's license says
you live in Van Nuys.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.194
Now, I know you're in agony.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.764
You want them to fix that femur
in a timely fashion?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.600
You cut the crap and confirm
what I already know.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.037
I don't keep anything.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.606
I just like taking 'em.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.543
I'm supposed to go to a rehab
in Arizona,

17:56.576 --> 18:00.413
but they won't take
my insurance.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.715
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

18:02.749 --> 18:06.153
Let me guess, if that bee
in your bonnet had a name,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.854
it'd be Michael.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.561
The guy he's seeing, he wants
to start bringing him around,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.963
to get to know the kids,
and I guess me.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.432
Well, maybe that might be worth
giving him a chance.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.769
-Hell no. -It might take away
a little of the pressure.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.305
Athena, look,
I'm just saying this.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.607
Maybe this guy is not all bad.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.909
Michael has a okay
track record picking 'em.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.112
I wouldn't care if he's dating
the Dalai Lama.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.914
I know.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.250
Michael being with somebody else
is a hard thing.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.253
What's hard is that somehow
we done decided

18:40.287 --> 18:42.922
that's what's best for the kids
is that we stay together

18:42.955 --> 18:44.691
and try to play
happy, modern family.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.260
All that means to me
is that Michael gets to keep

18:47.294 --> 18:50.197
having the cake of living
in my house and eating it, too,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.631
coming and going as he pleases.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.766
As far as I can see,
the only one doing

18:53.800 --> 18:56.102
any heavy emotional
lifting here is me.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.038
I'm the one who has to keep
pushing my feelings

18:59.071 --> 19:00.840
to the side every day.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.010
You got bigger problems
than Glenn, Athena.

19:04.043 --> 19:07.013
Kids love their daddies,

19:07.046 --> 19:09.282
but they follow
their mother's lead.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.818
No matter how good Michael is
with those kids,

19:11.851 --> 19:15.788
if you hate him...
they're gonna hate their daddy.

19:15.822 --> 19:20.059
I know, relationship problems
is going around, trust me.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.961
-You don't even want to know.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.297
Guys, you think we can
hit the road, please?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.633
She's second-guessing everything
I'm doing in here.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.735
It's kind of hurting
my feelings.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.170
I'll call you later.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.172
All right.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.679
BOBBY: You don't have to
be here with me, you know.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.314
Yeah, well,
this is all only happening

19:41.348 --> 19:44.183
because I'm the one who made you
get your blood drawn.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.518
I feel obligated.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.320
Listen, I'm here for you,

19:47.354 --> 19:50.223
-no matter what that doctor has
to say, right

19:52.259 --> 19:54.093
-Mr. Nash.
-Yeah.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.095
Thank you for coming in
so quickly.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.331
There are some findings
in your blood work

19:58.365 --> 19:59.999
that are time sensitive.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.534
He's good.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.336
You can speak freely
and directly.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.937
No need to sugarcoat.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.138
Please.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.683
Have you ever heard
of rhesus disease?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.286
Uh, no. How bad is it?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.455
It's terrible.
Fatal in most cases.

20:22.489 --> 20:25.024
But you don't have it.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.728
It only effects pregnant women
and their fetuses.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.097
I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.367
There are some 4,000 cases
of rhesus

20:34.401 --> 20:36.035
in newborns each year.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.905
You are almost
an identical match

20:38.938 --> 20:41.374
to a man in Australia
named James Harrison.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.544
For decades, his donated blood
saved the lives

20:44.577 --> 20:46.212
of more than
two million children.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.948
They call him the man
with the golden arm.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.319
Now, it seems you have one, too.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.587
If you would fill this out.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.989
We would love to get you

20:57.023 --> 20:59.125
into our rare donor's program
as soon as possible.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.394
We could set up
regular donations.

21:01.428 --> 21:05.565
There are babies at this
very moment who need you.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.401
Thank you.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.404
Congratulations.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.407
Yeah.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.244
Well, dude, I guess
you're gonna have to get over

21:18.277 --> 21:22.248
your fear of needles, huh?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.023
We can't see the tigers,
Uncle Sean.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.125
They're hiding behind the tree.

21:33.159 --> 21:36.162
All right, all right, all right.
Hang on.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.632
Okay.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.471
-SEAN: There we go.
-ADAM: Direct hit.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.475
Hang on. I'll get him moving.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.218
-Did-did you just throw
something

21:59.251 --> 22:01.187
-You're not supposed to taunt
the animals. -We're not.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.189
My-my nephew's just trying
to get a picture, that's all.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.891
-Oh, uh...

22:04.924 --> 22:07.026
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the one I want.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.695
SEAN:
Uh, come on.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.630
I got to take a leak.
Let's go. Go.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.981
Hey! Hey, what happened?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.517
Hey!

22:30.550 --> 22:32.519
What happened?!

22:32.552 --> 22:34.721
Boys?!

22:59.278 --> 23:02.214
ABBY:
911. What's your emergency?

23:09.422 --> 23:11.758
-He's, uh...
he's just staring at me.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.360
He won't take his eyes off me.
It's-it's like he's...

23:14.393 --> 23:16.629
It's like he's studying me.
Th-This isn't good.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.198
Zoo security's been alerted.
They're on their way to you now.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.633
Now's not gonna be
soon enough, okay?

23:20.667 --> 23:23.803
I've been on safari. I know
how fast these things can move.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.438
Sean, I'm being
told your best course

23:25.472 --> 23:27.206
is to remain very still.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.918
Sean, tell me what's happening.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.455
-Oh, God!

23:42.489 --> 23:45.124
I made it! I'm in the, uh...
the-the flamingo thing.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.627
Tell the zoo security I'm in
the flamingo thing, all right?

23:51.698 --> 23:54.400
-Oh, crap.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.569
-East side of the park.

23:56.603 --> 23:59.138
Nowhere near where we're going.
He's got a visitor pinned.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.573
Shoot team's en route now.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.742
You're gonna shoot him?
That's just not right.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.478
Protocol is to tranquilize
first, if at all possible.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.747
How did the tiger escape
in the first place?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.249
CARL: Apparently, he was able
to jump to the top of the wall

24:10.282 --> 24:12.251
-and gain enough leverage to
pull himself out.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.921
Tiger's trainer tried to
wrangle him after he got loose.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.255
This ain't pretty.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.659
It's, uh...
it's called degloving.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.862
The-the cat actually peels
the skin back with his claws.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.965
-Hen, saline.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.333
Sir, we have to disinfect
this wound.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.101
-How come it didn't
just kill you

24:29.135 --> 24:31.337
I've known Kobe
since he was a cub.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.139
He didn't want to hurt me.
He was just...

24:33.172 --> 24:35.474
He was just confused.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.777
Okay, if we're real careful,
we can preserve the skin.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.880
A little plastic surgery,
you're gonna be good as new.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.315
ABBY : All units
responding to Barnsdale Zoo.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.952
I have an adult male in
distress, east side of the park.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.788
He identified himself
as Sean Coopertino, 47,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.623
of Riverside.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.792

Show 727-L-30 responding.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.964
Can't be the same guy, can it?
That'll just be too weird.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.131
Same guy as what?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.901
Sean Coopertino.
The dentist from Riverside.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.240
Dr. Coopertino, how much did
you pay the illegal poachers?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.508
You knew the area
was a protected reserve.

25:09.542 --> 25:10.977
Were you aware
that Ellie was being tracked

25:11.010 --> 25:12.078
and studied
by the University of Oxford?

25:12.111 --> 25:13.479
I had no idea it was
a protected reserve.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.148
It was a legal hunting trip.
Now leave me alone.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.193
Cancel all my appointments.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.998
Get my lawyer on the phone.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.366
("You Oughta Know"
by Alanis Morissette playing)

25:48.881 --> 25:51.684
Oh.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.353
*

25:54.386 --> 25:56.188
* Oh-oh, oh-oh

25:56.222 --> 25:57.857
-* Oh-oh
-ABBY: Sean.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.360
-* You, you, you oughta know.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.395
Oh, God. Sean.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.698
SEAN:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.034
Stay where you are.
Security has your GPS location.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.102
-They're on their way
to you now. -Yeah, okay.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.538
I, uh... I don't see it anymore.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.507
I-I think I outsmarted it.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.319
*

26:40.432 --> 26:44.103
SHARPSHOOTER:
I got the tiger.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.948
I don't see him. Do you?

26:55.982 --> 26:58.450
I think I see him
hiding back there.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.389
ATHENA:
I'm not so sure he's hiding.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.458
Tranq him.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.465
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

27:13.499 --> 27:16.936
-SHARPSHOOTER: Yeah, he's down.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.281
HEN:
That's a beautiful animal.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.551
Chances are he's gonna have
to be put down after this.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.053
Maybe not.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.388
Guess who he had for lunch.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.724
Hmm?

27:37.757 --> 27:40.392
That's that idiot
that killed Ellie the Lion.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.729
-Mm-hmm.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.966
I think public sentiment
is gonna be with the kitty.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.701
You know what karma is.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.569
-A bitch.
-No.

27:50.602 --> 27:54.941
She's a wild animal,
and she won't be caged.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.584
-Hey. It's too quiet up in here.

28:07.619 --> 28:10.089
Your dad's waiting on you
downstairs with the Pictionary.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.024
Are you on your way out to work?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.961
Yeah, in a little while.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.098
Are you guys having a hard time
being with your dad?

28:19.131 --> 28:22.101
No. That's your problem.

28:23.770 --> 28:27.439
Uh, you know, what's going on
with your dad and me

28:27.473 --> 28:29.108
is complicated.

28:32.979 --> 28:36.515
What he's doing is...

28:36.548 --> 28:38.450
is brave,

28:38.484 --> 28:42.721
and all of us
need to support him.

28:42.755 --> 28:48.360
Your dad and I are trying
to keep this family together.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.796
Why?

28:49.829 --> 28:52.631
How is all of us being here,
living with you and Dad

28:52.664 --> 28:55.134
mad at each other,
helping our family?

28:55.167 --> 28:58.971
Dad being gay was hard at first,
but we love Dad.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.773
That's not the problem.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.109
So what is?

29:03.142 --> 29:05.577
Making us fake it every day.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.413
And for what?

29:07.446 --> 29:09.715
So you two can pretend
that you didn't mess up

29:09.748 --> 29:11.017
by marrying each other?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.522
We prefer honesty.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.626
Isn't that what
you always taught us?

29:23.495 --> 29:25.464
Hey, Bobby!

29:25.497 --> 29:27.466
So, that guy in Australia,
you know,

29:27.499 --> 29:30.302
the one with
the same blood makeup as you,

29:30.336 --> 29:32.471
says here, in 1999,
he was awarded

29:32.504 --> 29:34.673
the Medal
of the Order of Australia

29:34.706 --> 29:36.342
for saving those kids.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.010
And what would be
our equivalent?

29:38.044 --> 29:40.779
It's got to be the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, right?

29:40.813 --> 29:42.949
We should, like, totally put you
up for one of those, you know?

29:42.982 --> 29:45.317
-I mean, like, at some point.
-I gave some blood, Chim.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.519
It doesn't merit a medal.
All right?

29:47.553 --> 29:50.089
-Let's just drop it.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.092
It's the Presidential Medal
of...

29:57.029 --> 29:58.464
All right.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.466
You want to tell me
what's chafing you?

30:00.499 --> 30:03.202
Look, I get it.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.670
You don't like needles.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.873
But you're a lifesaver;
that's what you do.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.140
You're a hero, man.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.608
And somebody just told you
you have

30:09.641 --> 30:11.143
the opportunity
to save thousands,

30:11.177 --> 30:12.344
maybe millions of kids.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.813
They're the wrong kids!

30:14.847 --> 30:16.715
I want my kids!

30:18.350 --> 30:20.652
Yeah, I'm some lifesaver,
aren't I?

30:20.686 --> 30:22.521
That's what I was put
on this Earth to do,

30:22.554 --> 30:24.690
but I couldn't save my family.

30:24.723 --> 30:27.026
Couldn't protect them from me.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.161
A hundred and forty-eight.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.397
That's the number of lives
that I owe

30:31.430 --> 30:33.632
for the mistakes that I made.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.403
And once I pay that debt,
I get to be with them again.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.638
And I was halfway there, Chim.
I was halfway there.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.241
I was going to see my kids
again. That was the deal.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.876
Deal with who, Bobby?

30:43.910 --> 30:46.578
The deal I made with God.

30:49.715 --> 30:52.484
I don't think it's God
you made a deal with, Cap...

30:52.518 --> 30:54.186
And I got that phone call

30:54.220 --> 30:56.188
about my blood test,
and I thought,

30:56.222 --> 30:59.658
"Here we go. Here it is.
Here's my punishment: cancer."

30:59.691 --> 31:02.428
And for all the prayers
I sent up there,

31:02.461 --> 31:04.696
so I could live long enough...

31:06.065 --> 31:09.701
You're not talking about
killing yourself, are you?

31:09.735 --> 31:11.470
Yeah.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.942
I want out.

31:15.975 --> 31:19.078
I want to see my kids again.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.949
And I want this pain to end,
but it's not gonna end.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.117
It's never gonna end.

31:25.151 --> 31:28.955
'Cause God's not punishing me
by killing me.

31:28.988 --> 31:33.625
He's punishing me
by forcing me to stay alive.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.497
Wait, wait, Bobby. Bobby.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.475
ATHENA:
Mm.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.410
Something wrong with that cola?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.612
Hey. Nah.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.448
I keep a cooler in the truck
for washing blood

31:56.482 --> 31:58.417
away from the scenes
once we're done with them.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.253
Cola is the only thing
that really works.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.788
It's not in the job description,

32:02.821 --> 32:05.958
but I feel like
it's the right thing to do.

32:05.992 --> 32:09.095
Victim was D.O.A., by the way.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.097
Victim and suspect.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.900
Guy robs the joint, and then
gets hit by a dump truck

32:14.933 --> 32:16.468
a few feet from the store.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.937
-Hey, what was that thing

32:18.971 --> 32:21.173
you wanted to talk to me about?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.911
Athena...

32:25.944 --> 32:27.946
I messed up big-time.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.116
Work or personal?

32:30.149 --> 32:31.817
-Personal.
-Hmm.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.619
Money or sex?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.556
:
Sex.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.699
I slept with Eva.

32:47.733 --> 32:48.834
The hell?

32:48.867 --> 32:51.170
I thought
your ex was still in prison.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.539
Paroled, a few weeks ago.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.507
I don't know what came over me.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.943
It was, it was the night
of that full moon.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.712
I haven't been able to look
Karen in the eye since then.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.449
-Well, you got to tell her.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.551
I'm never gonna do it again.
It was a mistake.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.121
If anything, it just reminded me
that I want to be with my wife.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.791
I told you, I don't want
to screw this relationship up.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.827
Your relationship
is screwed up already.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.564
You don't cheat
on a healthy relationship.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.467
What you did is just evidence
of how bad it is.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.637
Now, your telling Karen
is your chance at fixing it.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.307
It's only when secrets
are revealed that we know

33:28.340 --> 33:30.342
how good or bad a marriage is.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.045
Now, trust me...

33:33.079 --> 33:35.247
I know.

33:35.281 --> 33:38.550
Sometimes you got to...

33:38.584 --> 33:42.754
wreck it in order to save it.

33:42.788 --> 33:47.226
There's a lot of love
between the two of you.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.596
-Thanks, Athena.
-Mmm.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.299
And let me know how it goes.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.935
Thanks for the cola.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.441
Huh?

34:35.474 --> 34:39.145
Oh. Hi, baby.
What time is it?

34:39.178 --> 34:41.380
Half past 11:00.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.350
-Mm.
-We need to talk.

34:47.986 --> 34:50.789
This is the hardest thing
I've...

34:50.822 --> 34:54.326
I've ever done, but I need to...

34:54.360 --> 34:57.095
do it now
while I still love you.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.510
Okay. What is this?

35:11.543 --> 35:14.180
The name and number
of my divorce attorney.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.648
Oh, no, Athena. No.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.017
Whoever you get should call him.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.119
-Athena.
-I love you.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.595
:
You're my man,

35:29.628 --> 35:34.266
the father of my children,
my best friend.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.536
This family... is changing.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.104
It is what it is.

35:39.137 --> 35:43.775
But us staying together
like this, living in this house,

35:43.809 --> 35:47.579
holding on
to some picture of what was...

35:49.515 --> 35:52.184
:
...it's making me hate you.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.152
If we don't really move on,

35:54.186 --> 35:57.189
that hate is gonna be
the only thing I feel

35:57.223 --> 35:58.857
when I think about you.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.159
Well, what about the kids?

36:01.193 --> 36:02.794
I spoke to them.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.030
This is what they want and need.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.932
Ah.

36:13.439 --> 36:15.441
I'm sorry, Athena.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.879
I'm so sorry for hurting you.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.449
I am.

36:33.058 --> 36:36.562
I will never regret
marrying you.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.367
I would do it all over again,
everything.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.937
And to have those children
and you as a friend,

36:45.971 --> 36:51.577
I would suffer all of it
a million times.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.082
*

37:46.097 --> 37:47.666
You're late.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.302
I'm sorry. I was, I was...

37:50.336 --> 37:52.804
just driving around.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.310
I needed to, um...
to get my mind right.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.145
About Eva?

38:07.886 --> 38:10.356
She's suing for custody.

38:10.389 --> 38:13.425
That's impossible.
Our-our lawyers said that...

38:13.459 --> 38:15.661
According to her,

38:15.694 --> 38:19.331
we have an unstable home that's
unsuitable to raise a child.

38:19.365 --> 38:24.836
And she's saying
the proof of this unstable home

38:24.870 --> 38:28.239
is that you slept with her.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.187
Listen, baby, I-I'm sorry.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.390
Let me just, let me,
let me just, let me explain.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.591
I'm gonna go pack some things.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.726
-I'm taking Denny to
my parents'. -Let me just ex...

38:47.759 --> 38:51.997
You put our family at risk.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.401
I don't know what it is
that you went there looking for,

38:55.434 --> 38:57.636
but I hope you got it.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.105
And I hope it was worth it.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.350
Oh, no, I didn't order this.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.085
From the gentleman.

39:14.119 --> 39:17.155
Oh.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.325
Um...

39:20.358 --> 39:22.227
Oh, God.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.195
*

39:27.933 --> 39:30.769
-I'm Aaron.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.704
Um, Athena.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.906
I hope you don't mind me
sending that over.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.708
Oh, well, no. I just...

39:36.742 --> 39:38.043
:
I just didn't realize

39:38.076 --> 39:39.344
that people still did this.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.413
Sending drinks over
to break the ice?

39:41.447 --> 39:43.615
I'm pretty sure
they haven't stopped doing that.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.086
So how long have you been out
of all of this?

39:48.119 --> 39:51.557
Um... it's-it's been a while.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.559
-Recently separated.
-Mm-hmm.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.728
-Two days.

39:56.762 --> 40:00.799
We've been working our way
towards it for a while now.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.068
I mean, no hard feelings.

40:03.101 --> 40:06.104
He's, um... he's at home
with our kids,

40:06.137 --> 40:10.108
so I-I decided to, you know,
just get out the house.

40:10.141 --> 40:14.446
Went to a movie...
and then I got thirsty.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.650
-I just didn't feel like
drinking alone. -Mm.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.251
I highly doubt
that you being alone

40:20.285 --> 40:22.253
is anything
you ever have a problem with.

40:22.287 --> 40:25.223
Ooh. Well, aren't you
Mr. Smooth?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.627
I would've guessed
that was your middle name.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.395
No, no. It's, uh, Chester.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.797
For real?

40:31.830 --> 40:34.432
Oh, your parents
hated you right away.

40:37.669 --> 40:40.338
What's your full name?

40:40.371 --> 40:42.641
Aaron Chester Brooks.

40:42.674 --> 40:45.343
Mm. Date of birth?

40:45.376 --> 40:48.814
April 18, 1980.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.816
What are you typing?

40:50.849 --> 40:52.818
Well, I'm a cop.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.487
Sending it to one of my friends
at the station,

40:55.521 --> 40:57.656
run a check on you.

40:57.689 --> 41:00.325
-Mm-hmm.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.694
If we're gonna spend the night
talking and drinking,

41:02.728 --> 41:06.264
I want to know I'm not wasting
my time with a bad egg.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.835
-We can toast to that.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.674
Hey, Chimney?

41:15.707 --> 41:17.342
What's going on?
You all right?

41:17.375 --> 41:21.613
Uh... come on.
I want to show you something.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.414
Come on.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.168
MAN:
Her name's Asha.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.037
-She's our first.
-Uh, this is Steven.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.873
I told him
I was bringing you by,

41:47.906 --> 41:50.208
-and he begged me
to let him talk to you. -Bobby.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.477
We never thought
we would get to meet her.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.046
Instead, she's starting
out life healthy

41:55.080 --> 41:57.215
-and disease-free.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.184
That's because of you.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.419
That's your blood
they rushed over here.

42:01.452 --> 42:05.557
-Thank you.
-* You got the will of a wild

42:05.591 --> 42:07.358
* A wild bird...

42:07.392 --> 42:09.761
Take care.

42:12.931 --> 42:15.400
CHIMNEY: Now you tell me
that's the wrong kid.

42:15.433 --> 42:19.537
Look, you're gonna see
your own kids again.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.707
I do believe that.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.541
But right now,

42:23.575 --> 42:26.612
Asha and a thousand others
just like her--

42:26.645 --> 42:28.880
they're your kids, too.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.682
That's your blood
in their veins.

42:30.716 --> 42:34.019
So you look at her, you look
at her and those young parents,

42:34.052 --> 42:37.188
and you tell me
if that feels like a punishment.

42:37.222 --> 42:40.058
No, Chim.
It's a blessing.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.129
Exactly.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.632
I think you better either
throw that book of yours away

42:46.665 --> 42:49.534
or get yourself a bigger one,
'cause it seems to me

42:49.567 --> 42:51.703
like you're here to stay.

42:51.737 --> 42:53.271
Looks that way.

42:53.304 --> 42:57.375
And just think, you'll only
have to give blood once.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.778
-Every eight weeks.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.648
-For the rest of your life.
-Oh, God.

43:02.681 --> 43:05.817
Could you explain to me again
how God's not punishing me?

43:05.851 --> 43:08.053
-Oh, he's just teasing you.
-Yeah.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.921
* You got some kind...

43:09.955 --> 43:14.492
Considering who I work with, he
must figure I can take a joke.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.294
* You got some kind

43:17.763 --> 43:20.899
* You got some kind of love

43:20.932 --> 43:23.368
* You got some kind

43:24.703 --> 43:27.639
* You got some kind

43:27.673 --> 43:29.507
* You got some kind of love.

44:12.718 --> 44:14.686
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.388

to check out from Fox.

We work side-by-side.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.902
