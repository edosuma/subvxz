Where are you going?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.230
[shouting] Who's gonna take our luggage?

10:48.022 --> 10:52.402
Pogo called it a promotion, but now
I have two jobs for the price of one.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.736
And I got his office

10:53.820 --> 10:56.573
but the fucker left me to clean it out.
And poor Rosie--

10:56.656 --> 11:00.201
-Look, Frank, I'm sorry but I called you--
-Jesus Christ.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.536
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

11:01.619 --> 11:02.579
-Yes.
<i>-Frank,</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:04.622
the slide projector isn't working.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.957
It works fine. Just jiggle it.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.542
Jiggle it? That's for the toilet.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.419
No, no, the jiggle's for everything.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.712
Bouillon cubes?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.463
Frank, I need help.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.048
This is my big day.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.509
I know it is, honey,
and I'm rooting for you.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.052
Just jiggle it. It's easy.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.804
Up, down, up, up, down. Hold.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.390
Hold. Down, up, shimmy, up, up, down.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.600
I can't remember that.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.811
Ask Maureen. You can do it, honey.
I love you. Knock 'em dead. Bye-bye.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.231
Jesus Christ, just jiggle
the fucking thing.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.484
Do I call you when the planes don't land?
Figure it out.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.654
[Bob over intercom]
<i>Why is my skycap not at his post?</i>

11:36.738 --> 11:38.740
[Frank] Oh, Christ, where's Rosie?

11:40.241 --> 11:44.204
Up, down, up, up, down. I--
Oh, I can't remember--

11:44.287 --> 11:45.872
-Hey, you, big dummy.
-Ah!

11:45.955 --> 11:50.126
I walk in your house without knocking
just like neighbor on TV show.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.836
But no applause.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.588
Oh, Nguyen-Nguyen.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.882
Oh, my God, I'm so glad
you could come today.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.634
Here's the merchandise.

11:57.884 --> 12:02.764
Hot from the greasy two-fingered hands
of Nikos at the Plast-A-Ware factory.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.059
[gasps] I still can't figure out
how you got Nikos to make

12:06.142 --> 12:07.936
so many so fast
and all under the table.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.564
It just took a little extra persuasion.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.607
[all chuckle]

12:13.191 --> 12:16.402
<i>Oh... you village whore.</i>

So here's an easy and fun way to remember
the order of operations.

Ooh, you're busted.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.240
[all laugh mockingly]

13:03.700 --> 13:08.288
Fourteen years I sweated my ass off
humping baggage at that place.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.373
Yeah, fuck that hotel.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.792
I worked at the airport, asshole.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.795
Look, man, I'm just trying
to keep you drinking, okay?

13:16.045 --> 13:16.879
[Frank] Hey, Rosie.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.091
I'm not in the mood, Frank.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.385
Listen, I know you're upset. However--

13:22.468 --> 13:24.345
Hey, it's the rubber man.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.973
-All right, rubber man.
-Hey, it's the rubber man, all right.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.308
Y'all got cherry?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.561
-Sorry, guys. Not the rubber man anymore.
-[all] Aw.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.273
Great, Frank, my wife's having a baby.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.358
No kidding, me too!

13:37.442 --> 13:39.694
My old lady's fixing to drop.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.195
I'm having twins.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.698
Wow! Must be something in the water.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.909
Look, Rosie, what went down today
was wrong, plain and simple.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.536
But Pogo screwed me too.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.538
That fat fuck has me doing two jobs

13:50.621 --> 13:53.499
-for the price of one.
-Well boo-motherfucking-hoo.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.335
Do birds shit on your office?

13:55.793 --> 13:59.005
I've been next in line for that job
ever since I trained you for it.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.089
I'm done.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.216
Come on, you're not done.
You don't really mean that.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.551
The fuck I don't.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.802
I got options.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.638
There's plenty of other places I can work
where I'll be appreciated.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.600
I got a cousin in Kentucky
who jacks off racehorses

14:10.683 --> 14:13.269
and he's been begging me
to come down to be his bucket man.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.815
You don't think I can understand what
you're going through because I'm white--

14:17.899 --> 14:21.569
Frank if you bring up that fucking
potato famine one more time...

14:21.652 --> 14:22.695
Okay, I won't.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.239
I'm just saying.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.240
A million people died.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.159
They came over here.
They were indentured servants,

14:28.242 --> 14:29.660
which is really
only one rung above slavery.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.579
That's one big motherfucking rung.

14:31.913 --> 14:32.955
Fair enough. Fair enough.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.749
Listen, uh...

14:35.124 --> 14:37.126
I brought Pogo with me.
He's out in the car.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.255
He wants to come in and clear this up...
And use the restroom.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.510
Let's play again.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.845
But if you want to beat me,
you have to hit it harder.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.223
I thought I was hitting it hard.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.267
About time. The cleaner finally got here.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.436
Brace yourself.

Why isn't it working?
You're not doing it the way Dad said.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.940
I'm the one who taught him.

21:15.024 --> 21:15.941
[thunder crashes]

21:16.025 --> 21:17.526
[all] Ooh.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.945
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.989
-I have to go.
-I haven't finished yet.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.658
Sue, they'd rather walk home
in a lightning storm

21:24.742 --> 21:26.869
-than hear any more of this.
-Nobody leaves!

21:30.289 --> 21:32.374
The Forkoontula does it all.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.753
Don't you realize
you can't live without it?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.630
It means everything to you.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.632
It's the key to your happiness!

21:40.090 --> 21:43.302
And the ability to cut pizza on the road!
Now who's taking one home?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.224
I said, who's taking one home?

21:55.147 --> 21:58.067
Come on, kid, let her pull you out.
You're gonna get electrocuted.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.568
I'm fine with that.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.615
I guess I have to repeat this lesson
just for you, Mr. Murphy.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.533
[Nuber chuckles]

22:05.616 --> 22:09.078
X is the variable, rock star.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.913
Solve for X.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.081
Just give me back my book.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.374
Solve for X!

22:13.457 --> 22:15.042
-[Nuber] Yeah, solve for X!
-[all laugh]

22:15.125 --> 22:16.377
I can't!

22:16.460 --> 22:20.089
Maybe if you weren't wasting time writing
your nursery rhymes, you would get it.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.716
-This is why you're in summer school!
-Well, you're here too!

22:22.800 --> 22:23.926
Oh, shit.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.847
Maybe if you were smarter,
you wouldn't be stuck in a sweat box

22:27.930 --> 22:29.390
teaching a dildo like me!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.141
Oh, shit!

22:31.225 --> 22:33.352
I'm here because I care, Mr. Poetry Man!

22:33.435 --> 22:35.396
I think you're here
'cause you need the money,

22:35.479 --> 22:37.481
judging by that hole in your slacks,
Mr. "Jerkin"!

22:37.565 --> 22:40.359
-This kid's got balls!
-There is a word that rhymes with Durkin!

22:40.442 --> 22:43.362
This hole is from when I got shot
last semester.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.781
What about the garbage bag
on your car window?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.157
Oh, my God!

22:47.241 --> 22:49.451

22:55.416 --> 22:57.251
[cheering]

22:58.127 --> 23:00.504
[Nuber] I have newfound respect for you.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.632
Ah!

23:03.716 --> 23:05.676
One, two, three, heave!

23:08.929 --> 23:12.141
Hey look!
That kid's got a fucking stinger!

23:12.224 --> 23:14.518
Check out his little front tail!

23:14.602 --> 23:15.561
[crowd laughs]

23:15.644 --> 23:16.687
And he's playing with it!

23:18.022 --> 23:19.064
Look at him go!

23:19.148 --> 23:20.524
[all laughing]

23:23.235 --> 23:24.069
[Frank] Rosie...

23:24.945 --> 23:28.157
Look, I can't blame you if you never want
to set foot in that airport again.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.868
But I'd miss you.
You're the best man I know.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.414
And eating lunch with you
is the only decent part of my day.

23:36.290 --> 23:40.252
Frank, I know you mean well
and I love you like a brother.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.714
But I think I've had
enough of white people for one day.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.132
Okay.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.134
I get it.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.304
Maybe I don't.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.181
See you around.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.936
[door opens and closes]

23:59.104 --> 24:01.065
So, uh, you going to Kentucky?

24:01.148 --> 24:05.569
No. They know I'm coming back
to that airport tomorrow.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.780
I got a wife. I got kids...

24:08.197 --> 24:10.449
which means I got no choice.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.912
Can I get your cousin's phone number?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.839
My fucking life is over.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.841
It's over.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.426
It's fucking over.

24:29.969 --> 24:30.844
[Bridget] Hey, you.

24:31.679 --> 24:32.513
Hey.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.807
You streaked the whole pool.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.100
Yup.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.812
-You're such a badass!
-Huh?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.815
You don't give a shit
what anybody thinks, do you?

24:42.898 --> 24:46.110
Uh, nope. That's me. Don't give a shit.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.029
-Want to walk home with me?
-Sure.

24:49.113 --> 24:49.989
Yeah.

Hanging out with girls now, you fairy?

24:52.950 --> 24:55.119
Go shit in your fist, fuck face!

24:55.202 --> 24:56.370
Ah!

24:57.204 --> 25:00.207
Whoa, you're kind of a badass too.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.418
-Aw, shut up.
-[chuckles]

25:02.501 --> 25:04.378
-[grunts]
-Come on.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.306
Your mommy had a big win today.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.267
A big win.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.853
I sold five Forkoontulas.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.604
Even Maureen bought one.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.857
I can't wait to tell your dad.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.692
He should be home any minute now.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.154
[radio announcer]<i> And that</i>

-[pounding on door]
-Jesus!

25:56.764 --> 25:58.474
Hey, soldier. How you doing?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.976
Chet, it has been one hell of a day.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.729
Hey, if you got a few minutes,
I've been thinking about that baby room

26:03.812 --> 26:06.648
we're gonna build for you.
Jotted down a few ideas.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.068
Jesus, when did you have time
to do all this?

26:09.151 --> 26:10.778
Yeah, I don't sleep that good.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.738
Hey, maybe later
we could talk about the plans.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.323
After you unwind with your family.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.246
How about right now?

26:21.330 --> 26:22.247
[Chet] All right then.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.500
One cold brew reporting for duty.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.544
So, kind of getting my initial thoughts
down for this here room

26:27.628 --> 26:29.630
and I know early on
we're gonna have a baby room.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.008
So, you get your crib chair and get
your folding table, changing table,

26:33.092 --> 26:35.094
and then, as that boy gets older,

26:35.177 --> 26:37.930
well bam, you got yourself 
a gun rack area right here.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.640
Plenty of space on that there wall

26:39.723 --> 26:42.184
to hang up them animal trophies
from when y'all go hunting.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.354
And then, maybe even a sink in this area.
Plumbing's my specialty.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.439
Don't you even think about price.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.234
You can do the skinning right there,
skin them animals, bring them back raw.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.277
These are just spit-firing ideas,
of course.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.612
Then I thought we could turn it

26:53.695 --> 26:55.489
into a thing
where you can kind of bolt the door.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.241
Maybe have an interrogation table--

26:57.324 --> 26:59.952
We like to call it
the "What really happened" table. Uh...

27:00.035 --> 27:01.578
And of course,
you get all the tools for that.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.665
You know, all the little spikes
and nails and needles and glue

27:04.748 --> 27:07.126
and all the shit you need
to get them to truth talkers.

27:07.209 --> 27:10.212
Other option, option B, is you go ahead

27:10.295 --> 27:13.841
and you kind of make yourself
a when-the-world-ends room.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.635
So, you get some slot holes in here,
gun holes in here.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.595
Run it up your flag pole,
see if you salute it.
