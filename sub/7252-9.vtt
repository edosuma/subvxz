'CAUSE THE PIPES GOT TRASHED

10:54.154 --> 10:56.573

10:58.283 --> 11:00.952
INSTALLING THE TOWEL RACK,

11:00.952 --> 11:02.954
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

11:00.952 --> 11:02.954
THE WHOLE BATHROOM'S DEMO'D.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.205
BECAUSE OF THE TOWEL RACK?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.416
I GOT VERY ANGRY

11:04.205 --> 11:06.416
AT THIS TOWEL RACK.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.626

16:08.175 --> 16:10.010
OH, RATS.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.010
I HAD THAT FOR LUNCH.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.597
WELL, THAT SEEMS TO BE

16:10.010 --> 16:12.597
ALL I HAVE IN HERE.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.350
ROBERT'S SHOPPING SKILLS LEAVE

16:12.597 --> 16:16.350
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.977
SO, GRANDPA --

16:16.350 --> 16:17.977
WAIT!

16:17.977 --> 16:20.563
I THINK I HAVE

16:17.977 --> 16:20.563
SOME CANNED PEACHES.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.231
YOU'VE REALLY MADE IT

16:20.563 --> 16:22.231
COMFORTABLE OUT HERE.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.858
HUH. PEARS.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.152
NICE.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.152
LIKE A VACATION SPOT.

16:26.152 --> 16:31.491
YOU KNOW, FUN AND ALL YOURS --

16:26.152 --> 16:31.491
NOT PERMANENT, BUT FUN FOR NOW.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.911
YES, WELL, FUN FOR NOW IS

16:31.491 --> 16:34.911
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.954
SO, IT'S NOT PERMANENT?

16:35.954 --> 16:37.538
WHAT?

16:35.954 --> 16:37.538
THE POOL HOUSE.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.874
IT'S NOT PERMANENT.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.874
YOU JUST SAID "FUN FOR NOW."

16:39.874 --> 16:42.376
DID I?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.376
I MUST HAVE HEARD IT SOMEWHERE.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.962
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.672
IT'S GOOD TO SHAKE THINGS UP

16:43.962 --> 16:45.672
EVERY NOW AND THEN --

16:45.672 --> 16:47.632
YOU KNOW, PUT A LITTLE PAINT

16:45.672 --> 16:47.632
ON THE HOUSE,

16:47.632 --> 16:49.509
MOVE THE FURNITURE AROUND

16:47.632 --> 16:49.509
THE DEN, GO BLOND --

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
BUT AFTER YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT,

16:51.344 --> 16:55.055
IT CAN ALSO BE NICE TO GO BACK

16:51.344 --> 16:55.055
TO SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE,

16:55.055 --> 16:58.977
SOMETHING YOU'VE DEPENDED ON

16:55.055 --> 16:58.977
FOR, LET'S SAY, 40 YEARS.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.687
I MEAN, IF SOMETHING'S BEEN

16:58.977 --> 17:00.687
AROUND THAT LONG,

17:00.687 --> 17:02.563
IT MUST BE FOR A REASON,

17:00.687 --> 17:02.563
RIGHT?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.357
YOU'RE A LOVELY GIRL.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.900
I HAVE GOOD GENES.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.778
OH! I THINK I REMEMBER SEEING

17:05.900 --> 17:08.778
A FROZEN PIZZA IN HERE.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.613
REALLY?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.613
AHA!

17:10.613 --> 17:12.824
NOW...

17:12.824 --> 17:15.368
THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS DISCOVERY

17:12.824 --> 17:15.368
IS THAT SINCE ROBERT

17:15.368 --> 17:17.077
IS CURRENTLY DOING

17:15.368 --> 17:17.077
ALL THE SHOPPING,

17:17.077 --> 17:18.579
THIS PIZZA

17:17.077 --> 17:18.579
COULD HAVE BEEN HERE

17:18.579 --> 17:20.874
SINCE LORELAI'S

17:18.579 --> 17:20.874
10th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.543
THE UPSIDE, HOWEVER, IS THAT

17:20.874 --> 17:23.543
THERE IS CHEESE IN THE CRUST.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.379
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A "GLASS IS

17:23.543 --> 17:26.379
HALF FULL" KIND OF GAL MYSELF.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.130
ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.883
HERE GOES NOTHING.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.927
Stupid little -- I can't find --

17:29.883 --> 17:32.927
ridiculous.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.638
He should have taken...

17:35.638 --> 17:37.807
WHAT, MOM?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.807
OH, NOTHING.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.393
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE

17:37.807 --> 17:40.393
A PROPER DRINK.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.562
SORRY ABOUT THE CHANGE

17:40.393 --> 17:42.562
OF PLANS.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.731
OH, PLEASE. I'M AS FLEXIBLE

17:42.562 --> 17:44.731
AS THE NEXT PERSON.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.941
RORY THOUGHT THAT SINCE DAD'S

17:44.731 --> 17:46.941
MOVED OUT TO THE POOL HOUSE,

17:46.941 --> 17:49.027
WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH TIME

17:46.941 --> 17:49.027
WITH EITHER OF YOU, SO --

17:49.027 --> 17:50.110
I GUESS I COULD USE THE ICE

17:49.027 --> 17:50.110
IN THE FREEZER,

17:50.110 --> 17:51.863
THOUGH IT'S PROBABLY OLD.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.032
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- A

17:51.863 --> 17:54.032
LITTLE NOTICE ENSURES FRESH ICE.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.616
I'M SORRY.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.616
WHO SAYS THAT?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.202
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO HAVE

17:55.616 --> 17:58.202
SCOTCH NEAT.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.202
SUPER.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.248
I'D OFFER YOU WINE, BUT ALL THE

17:58.202 --> 18:02.248
WINE I HAVE HAS TO BREATHE.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.584
AND THAT REQUIRES NOTICE.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.965
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

18:10.965 --> 18:12.466
NOTHING.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.011
IT'S JUST -- ISN'T --

18:12.466 --> 18:15.011
ISN'T THIS WEIRD TO YOU?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.721
WHAT?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.721
SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER?

18:16.721 --> 18:17.972
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MOVE?

18:17.972 --> 18:19.974
NO, IT'S FINE.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.974
IT'S JUST...CLOSE.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.685
WILL YOU EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN

18:19.974 --> 18:22.685
WHY WE ARE DOING THIS?

18:22.685 --> 18:25.312
I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE YOU

18:22.685 --> 18:25.312
USUALLY SIT OVER THERE.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.024
I'M TALKING ABOUT RORY BEING

18:25.312 --> 18:28.024
IN THE POOL HOUSE, LORELAI.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.776
RORY JUST THOUGHT WE SHOULD

18:28.024 --> 18:29.776
SPLIT UP TONIGHT,

18:29.776 --> 18:33.153
GET IN SOME QUALITY...

18:29.776 --> 18:33.153
COUCH TIME.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.530
IT SEEMS VERY SILLY.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.949
WE HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD SYSTEM

18:34.530 --> 18:35.949
WORKED OUT.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.076
I DON'T KNOW

18:35.949 --> 18:38.076
WHY WE CHANGED IT.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.076
MMM.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.330
SO, MOM, DO YOU THINK YOU AND

18:40.787 --> 18:43.330
DAD ARE GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

18:43.330 --> 18:45.374
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.374
OKAY, GOT ANY PEANUTS?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.960
YOUR FATHER HAS PROVEN TO ME

18:45.374 --> 18:46.960
ONCE AND FOR ALL

18:46.960 --> 18:48.377
HE'S MOVED ON WITH HIS LIFE.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.712
YOU DON'T THINK THE MOVING ON

18:48.377 --> 18:49.712
WITH HIS LIFE

18:49.712 --> 18:51.422
WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY

18:49.712 --> 18:51.422
INCLUDED MOVING?

18:51.422 --> 18:52.966
NO.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.966
OKAY.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.134
WE ATTENDED THE DORMAN SCHOOL

18:52.966 --> 18:55.134
BAZAAR LAST WEEK.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.596
IT WAS A BIG, FORMAL GATHERING.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.596
ALL OUR FRIENDS WERE THERE.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.307
AND AT DINNER, HE MADE ME REACH

18:58.596 --> 19:01.307
FOR THE BUTTER.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.725
WHAT?

19:02.725 --> 19:04.143
IT WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE

19:02.725 --> 19:04.143
IN FRONT OF HIM,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.020
AND YET HE DIDN'T OFFER ME

19:04.143 --> 19:06.020
THE DISH.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.605
HE BUTTERED HIS OWN ROLL,

19:07.605 --> 19:10.399
OFFERED THE DISH TO THE MAN NEXT

19:07.605 --> 19:10.399
TO HIM, AND THAT WAS IT.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.944
AND THAT'S WHY YOU THINK

19:10.399 --> 19:12.944
HE'S MOVED ON?

19:12.944 --> 19:14.946
IT WAS A TOTAL DISREGARD

19:12.944 --> 19:14.946
FOR MY NEEDS.

19:14.946 --> 19:18.074
I MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE HAD

19:14.946 --> 19:18.074
A ROLL IN FRONT OF ME AT ALL.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.451
WELL, MOM, I'M SORRY.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.202
IT'S VERY UPSETTING.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.246
BUT AT SOME POINT,

19:22.202 --> 19:24.246
YOU HAVE TO FACE THE FACTS,

19:24.246 --> 19:26.165
AND THE FACTS ARE

19:24.246 --> 19:26.165
HE'S MOVED ON,

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
AND THEREFORE,

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
I SHOULD MOVE ON ALSO.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.628
ABSOLUTELY.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.628
moveon.org.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.590
I THINK IT'S TIME

19:32.296 --> 19:34.590
FOR ME TO DATE.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.300
OH, MY GOD!

19:36.300 --> 19:37.802
I WANT TO GO ON A DATE.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.261
WITH...A MAN?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.387
NO, A WEASEL.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.387
OF COURSE WITH A MAN.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.973
I'M NOT HEARING THIS.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.183
WHY SHOULDN'T I DATE?

19:41.973 --> 19:44.183
I'M STILL A VIABLE COMMODITY.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.977
I NEED A PAPER TOWEL

19:44.183 --> 19:45.977
AND A VALIUM, PLEASE.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.603
THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN

19:45.977 --> 19:47.603
AT THE CLUB

19:47.603 --> 19:49.772
WHO, IN THE PAST, HAVE MADE

19:47.603 --> 19:49.772
THEIR INTERESTS IN ME KNOWN.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.899
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW

19:49.772 --> 19:51.899
TO RECIPROCATE THEIR FEELINGS.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.818
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

19:51.899 --> 19:53.818
WITH MEN.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.236
HOW DO YOU LET THEM KNOW

19:53.818 --> 19:56.236
THAT YOU'RE AVAILABLE?

19:56.236 --> 19:58.614
WELL, ONE OF THOSE BENCH ADS

19:56.236 --> 19:58.614
USUALLY DOES THE TRICK.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
LORELAI, STOP IT.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
I NEED HELP HERE.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.493
IT'S BEEN YEARS

20:00.908 --> 20:02.493
SINCE I DID THIS,

20:02.493 --> 20:04.912
AND I DON'T REMEMBER

20:02.493 --> 20:04.912
THE PROPER PROCEDURE.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.123
NOW, TAKE ME THROUGH THIS

20:04.912 --> 20:07.123
STEP BY STEP.

20:07.123 --> 20:11.418
YOU SEE A MAN, YOU WALK UP

20:07.123 --> 20:11.418
TO HIM, AND YOU SAY...

20:11.418 --> 20:12.545
HELLO.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.629
IS THAT TOO FORWARD?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.214
NO, IT'S THE APPROPRIATE WAY

20:15.214 --> 20:17.591
TO INDICATE YOU'RE OPEN

20:15.214 --> 20:17.591
TO A SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.886
UNLESS, HOWEVER, YOU ARE

20:17.591 --> 20:19.886
APPROACHING A WEASEL.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.554
THEN I BELIEVE

20:19.886 --> 20:21.554
THE PROPER SIGNAL

20:21.554 --> 20:23.639
IS JUST TO OFFER HIM

20:21.554 --> 20:23.639
YOUR HINDQUARTERS.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.727
HEY.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.727
MY NIGHT WAS GREAT.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.436
OH.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.355
GRANDPA MADE FROZEN PIZZA.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.315
GRANTED, HE MADE IT

20:31.355 --> 20:33.315
ON A CEDAR PLANK,

20:33.315 --> 20:35.317
WHICH WAS NOT WHAT THE

20:33.315 --> 20:35.317
MANUFACTURER INTENDED,

20:35.317 --> 20:37.862
BUT I GOT A CHANCE TO SAY

20:35.317 --> 20:37.862
A LOT OF THINGS TO HIM --

20:37.862 --> 20:40.614
THINGS ABOUT LIVING IN THE POOL

20:37.862 --> 20:40.614
HOUSE AND ABOUT HIM AND GRANDMA,

20:40.614 --> 20:42.491
AND THOUGH I USED

20:40.614 --> 20:42.491
VEILED REFERENCES,

20:42.491 --> 20:45.703
I KNOW HE GOT MY POINT, AND HE

20:42.491 --> 20:45.703
IS DEFINITELY THINKING ABOUT IT.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.746
HOW DID YOU DO?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.247
GRANDMA WANTS TO DATE.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.247
WHAT?!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.999
SHE WANTS TO DATE MEN

20:48.247 --> 20:49.999
WHO HANG OUT AT THE CLUB

20:49.999 --> 20:51.876
AND WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST

20:49.999 --> 20:51.876
IN HER IN THE PAST.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.419
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

20:51.876 --> 20:53.419
SHE WANTS TO DATE?

20:53.419 --> 20:54.962
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE HER

20:53.419 --> 20:54.962
WANT TO DATE.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.130
YOU WERE SUPPOSED

20:54.962 --> 20:56.130
TO MAKE HER WANT

20:56.130 --> 20:57.882
TO GET BACK TOGETHER

20:56.130 --> 20:57.882
WITH GRANDPA!

20:57.882 --> 21:00.009
HEY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO MAKE ME

20:57.882 --> 21:00.009
HAVE DINNER ALONE WITH HER.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.301
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

21:01.301 --> 21:02.887
I SAID, "ARE YOU GETTING BACK

21:01.301 --> 21:02.887
WITH DAD?"

21:02.887 --> 21:04.513
AND SHE SAID

21:02.887 --> 21:04.513
HE WOULDN'T BUTTER HER ROLL.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.682
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.682
I'M SORRY.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.682
I TRIED.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.767
YOU DID NOT TRY.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.309
I DID TRY.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.309
I JUST SUCKED AT IT.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.145
LOOK, SHE PROBABLY

21:09.309 --> 21:11.145
DIDN'T MEAN IT, OKAY?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.147
SHE'S JUST MAD AT DAD,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.147
AND SHE WAS JUST TALKING.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.440
NEXT WEEK WE'LL SWITCH.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.942
YOU CAN HAVE DINNER

21:14.440 --> 21:15.942
WITH MY MOTHER,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.193
AND I'LL MARRY MY DAD OFF

21:15.942 --> 21:17.193
TO A NICE BARONESS.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.070
DON'T JOKE.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.070
DON'T HATE ME.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.864
I DON'T HATE YOU.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.864
I CAN'T HATE THE PATHETIC.
