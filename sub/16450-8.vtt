Craboo.

Got it!

They'll be here soon.
We have to hurry.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.633
[ Sighs ] Well,
if you love something,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.201
you got to
let it go, I guess.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.536
We'll all miss you, Craboo.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.504
You were a heck of
a lot of fun.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.373
You're a good friend,
Craboo.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.175
I'll never forget you.

[ Grunts ]

19:48.755 --> 19:50.323
Go.

Secure the perimeter!

20:22.289 --> 20:23.790
I want this beach on lockdown.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.958
All right,
where's the fugitive?

20:25.992 --> 20:27.427
He's gone.
Gone?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.362
Female officer: Sir,
I think I found something.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.097
It looks like
some kind of starfish.

Hey, put me down!

with you bears.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.704
I demand you arrest them!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.038
They don't have
the fugitive.

The trail's gone cold.
Nothing we can do.

Oh, nothing you can do?

20:42.309 --> 20:43.810
You're the police!
I demand justice!

20:43.843 --> 20:45.478
Sir, you're being
disorderly.

If you don't calm down,
I'm gonna have to detain you.

right now!

All right, boys,
let's go.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.010
Phew.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.946
Well, at least we just
got community service.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.383

it'll take to do 500 hours?

Hey, I miss him, too.
