WEBVTT

00:10.467 --> 00:13.867
- I hope you're all ready
for tonight's Model U.N.

00:13.967 --> 00:17.367
You'll get a window
into world politics.

00:17.467 --> 00:20.500
You'll be graded on
how well you represent

00:20.600 --> 00:22.333
your assigned country.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.133
- GIDEON: Hey!

00:26.233 --> 00:28.867
Shhh.

00:28.967 --> 00:32.733
- Hey...girl.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.733
- We've talked about
this, Gideon.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.233
So, the whole point
of Model U.N.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.800
is to achieve world peace.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.000
- You'll get no
peace from Greenland!

00:43.100 --> 00:45.800
Thanks to world pollution,
our ice is melting

00:45.900 --> 00:49.433
and our polar bears
"no-bear" to go.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.367
And I'll keep dropping bad puns
until the madness stops.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.233
- Oh, Mrs. Austin,
look what I can do!

01:04.333 --> 01:07.067
Wah! Wah! Guh! Guh!
Guh! Guh! Guh!

01:07.167 --> 01:09.567
- Do you need to go
to the nurse's office?

01:09.667 --> 01:12.433
- Guh! Guh! Guh!

01:12.533 --> 01:14.133
- That was close.

01:14.233 --> 01:17.767
- That was so not worth it!

01:22.167 --> 01:23.867
- Nice flip, Phoebe.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.933
You from a circus family?

01:26.067 --> 01:27.600
- Mrs. Austin, I'm sorry
I missed class.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.700
- I don't know what's
going on with you lately,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.267
but you're about to flunk.

01:31.367 --> 01:33.433
That means you'll have to make
this class up in night school.

01:33.533 --> 01:35.833
- I don't wanna go
to school at night.

01:35.933 --> 01:37.233
- Tell you what.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.067
If you, as Argentina,

01:39.167 --> 01:42.767
bring peace to
Model U.N., you pass.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.233
- Wait, didn't you say last week
that no one's ever done that?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.400
- Yeah, it's impossible.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.200
Good luck!

01:49.767 --> 01:53.567
- *

01:53.667 --> 01:56.800
- So, why were you
late to class this time?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.833
- Max adopted
a thousand hamsters.

01:58.933 --> 02:00.433
- Aw, cute.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.600
- To power a doomsday device.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.067
- Ooh, sinister.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.400
- I've been so busy trying to
save Hiddenville from him,

02:07.500 --> 02:09.333
I can barely keep
up with school.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.267
Although, I did
figure out a way

02:11.367 --> 02:14.400
to keep him contained
for awhile.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.200
- The hamster has
become the hamstee.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.300
There you are!

02:20.400 --> 02:24.367
- It also came filled
with a little bit of helium.

02:24.467 --> 02:25.800
- You may have won
the battle, Phoebe,

02:25.900 --> 02:27.800
but the war isn't over!

02:31.800 --> 02:33.933
- *

02:34.067 --> 02:35.200
* What you see

02:35.300 --> 02:36.667
* Is not what you get

02:36.767 --> 02:40.067
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:40.100 --> 02:41.733
* We fit right in

02:41.833 --> 02:43.200
* Bet you never guessed

02:43.300 --> 02:44.733
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:44.833 --> 02:46.333
* Just like all the rest

02:46.433 --> 02:48.067
* A picture
perfect family *

02:48.167 --> 02:50.200
* Is what we try to be

02:50.300 --> 02:51.367
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:51.467 --> 02:53.200
* The crazy things we do

02:53.300 --> 02:54.900
* This isn't
make believe *

02:55.067 --> 02:56.433
* It's our reality

02:56.533 --> 02:58.100
* Just your average family

02:58.200 --> 03:01.233
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:01.333 --> 03:04.867
* Livin' a double life *

03:09.267 --> 03:10.733
- Cherry, what am
I gonna do?

03:10.833 --> 03:12.467
If I don't pass, I have
to go to night school.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.333
And night school's filled
with creepers and weirdos.

03:14.433 --> 03:15.933
- It's not so bad.

03:16.067 --> 03:18.133
I took a night class on
how to improve your memory.

03:21.133 --> 03:22.800
Anyway...

03:22.900 --> 03:24.467
I don't know how I'm
supposed to get world peace

03:24.567 --> 03:26.300
with Allison in our class.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.333
I once fought a guy with
a crab claw for a hand--

03:28.433 --> 03:30.567
and she's scarier!

03:30.667 --> 03:32.300
- And between her and Max,

03:32.400 --> 03:33.867
you totally have
your hands full.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.533
- Ha! Ha! I'm a wrecking
ball now, Phoebe!

03:40.700 --> 03:43.567
- I hate that he's
having so much fun in there.

03:48.667 --> 03:52.300
Hey, what if I set Max and
Allison up on a date tonight?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.833
Then they would both
be outta my hair.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.067
- Speaking of your hair,

03:55.167 --> 03:57.533
is it like shinier
than usual?

03:57.633 --> 03:59.500
- New conditioner.
- Love it!

03:59.600 --> 04:02.533
But your plan's horrible.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.767
Allison and Max don't
even like each other.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.400
- But what if I just
told them that they did?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.533
- Well, then that
would be lying.

04:09.633 --> 04:13.600
- Um, I prefer the term
"creative coupling."

04:13.700 --> 04:16.467
Allison, what's up, sister?
- Hi, Phoebe.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.400
I'm just writing some
chants for Model U.N.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.633
No peace! No way!
We don't care what you say!

04:22.733 --> 04:25.100
- You know who else loves
yelling in my face?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.967
My brother Max.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.067
- Oh, I know Max.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.067
I don't like him at all.

04:31.167 --> 04:33.467
- That's 'cause you
don't know the real Max.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.633
In fact, he's researching
forms of clean energy--

04:35.733 --> 04:37.433
like hamster power.

04:37.533 --> 04:41.067
- I love hamsters!
- So does he!

04:41.167 --> 04:42.667
Check it out!

04:42.767 --> 04:45.067
- Oh, ho, ho,
look at the little guy.

04:45.167 --> 04:48.067
- And I know for a fact
he has a crush on you.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.400
So, what do ya say?

04:49.500 --> 04:52.300
You wanna go out
with hamster boy?

04:52.400 --> 04:54.433
- I guess one night
out won't hurt.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.667
- I can't. Model U.N.,
remember?

04:57.767 --> 04:59.567
- Oh, you didn't
get the email?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.167
Mrs. Austin moved
it to tomorrow.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.067
- Yeah.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.233
- Splatburger, 7:30, bye!

05:05.333 --> 05:09.933
- *

05:11.200 --> 05:13.467
Max?

05:13.567 --> 05:15.167
Ice? That's weird.

05:15.267 --> 05:17.400
- MAX: Three, two, one!

05:17.500 --> 05:20.367
- MAX & COLOSSO:

05:21.867 --> 05:24.067
- MAX: Woo!
- COLOSSO: Oh, yeah!

05:24.167 --> 05:26.100
New record.

05:27.467 --> 05:29.400
- Never.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.733
What are you doin'
down here?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.067
Get out.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.233
- Fine. I was just
gonna tell you about

05:37.333 --> 05:39.233
a hot girl who
has a crush on you.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.567
- Hot girl. Crush.
I'm listening.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.900
- It's a trap!
- Shush. Shush. Shush.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.633
Who?
- Allison.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.667
- It was a trap.
I don't wanna date her.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.633
She's trying to
save the world.

05:49.733 --> 05:51.367
I'm trying to destroy it.

05:51.467 --> 05:54.233
- True, but she's
super into you.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.200
- Well...

05:56.300 --> 05:58.167
I guess we have
that in common.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.567
- So, are you good
with tonight?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.900
- Let me check
with my assistant.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.167
- Hm...

06:06.267 --> 06:07.767
Tonight we have the thing

06:07.867 --> 06:09.900
we were gonna destroy
with the thing.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.833
- Allison said she'd pay.
- Cancel the thing.

06:12.933 --> 06:16.600
- Perfect. Splatburger.
7:30. Bye!

06:16.700 --> 06:18.900
- See if she has
an evil pet!

06:19.067 --> 06:22.833
Unless it's a cat.
I don't date cats.

06:22.933 --> 06:25.067
And I'm not ready
to talk about it.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.500
- All right, guys,
we're heading out.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.067
Max and Phoebe have plans.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.967
But Cousin Blobbin should
be here any minute.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.900
- I don't know why
we need a babysitter.

06:35.067 --> 06:38.600
Surprise attack!

06:38.700 --> 06:41.067
- That's why.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.933
- COLOSSO: Hey,
why can't I babysit?

06:43.067 --> 06:45.067
- 'Cause Chloe can
teleport to anywhere

06:45.133 --> 06:48.867
at any time and you...
you can't hold a cup.

06:50.767 --> 06:54.233
- Don't judge him.
It's harder than it looks.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.067
- Also, we don't trust you

07:00.100 --> 07:01.633
because you are
an evil villain.

07:01.733 --> 07:05.067
- Max is evil.
He babysits all the time.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.667
- Max is not evil.
He's just going through a phase.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.900
- It's not a phase!
I'm evil!

07:14.933 --> 07:17.067
- Oh, Blobbin says he's
about to drop in.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.567
- Thunderman!

07:23.667 --> 07:25.167
- NORA & BILLY: Blobbin!

07:25.267 --> 07:26.833
- Blobbin, why did you
jump out of a plane

07:26.933 --> 07:28.433
without using
a parachute?

07:28.533 --> 07:29.900
- Oh, I didn't
come by plane.

07:30.067 --> 07:33.600
My scientists at Blob-Co
catapulted me here.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.967
Being indestructible
is fun!

07:36.067 --> 07:39.267
Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

07:39.367 --> 07:41.167
Oh, my goodness.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.267
Is this Chloe?
- Mm-hm.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.633
- Aww...

07:44.733 --> 07:47.733
Do you have a hug for
your Cousin Blobbin?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.733
- Filthy.

07:49.833 --> 07:52.833
- Cousin Blobbin!
- Ohhhh...

07:52.933 --> 07:54.500
- Oh, Hank and I have
so much trouble

07:54.600 --> 07:57.100
leaving our babies behind.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.633
Right, Hank

07:59.733 --> 08:01.800
- Oh, okay, I guess
we're leaving.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.567
Okay. All right, kids.
Be good!

08:04.667 --> 08:06.667
- Don't worry.
They're in safe hands.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.233
Hey, who wants to launch
a rocket tonight?

08:11.333 --> 08:14.433
- BILLY & NORA: I do!
- BLOBBIN: Yay!

08:14.533 --> 08:19.567
- *

08:19.667 --> 08:22.567
- Uh, ha. Let me guess.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.733
Your country is Turkey.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.200
Well, that changes things.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.067
- Oh, you'll like this.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.933
Uh, I just brokered a deal
between Scotland and Norway.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.833
Gideon wanted that
Viking shield

08:40.933 --> 08:42.767
and Wolfgang wanted
that sweet bagpipe.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.867
- Oh, by the way, I brought
a peace cake for later,

08:49.967 --> 08:53.067
so that everyone
can have a "peace" of cake.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.667
Yeah, the woman at the bakery
didn't laugh either.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.200
- It's a good thing
that Max and Allison

08:59.300 --> 09:02.933
agreed to go on that date,
even if you did have to lie.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.867
- I really don't wanna
go to school at night.

09:05.967 --> 09:09.600
- Phoebe, Russia
has demands.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.867
It's me, Oyster.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.633
I will sign peace,

09:14.733 --> 09:17.067
if Turkey gives me
turkey sandwiches.

09:17.133 --> 09:20.600
Mother Russia skipped
lunch today.

09:22.067 --> 09:25.233
I could get you one of
Australia's stuffies.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.100
- Gobble. Gobble.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.967
- *

09:31.067 --> 09:32.700
- NORA & BILLY: Whoa!

09:32.800 --> 09:35.900
- Cool rocket.
Can I ride it?

09:36.067 --> 09:37.867
- No, Chloe, it's dangerous.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.300
Also you didn't
call dibs. Dibs!

09:40.400 --> 09:43.167
- Sorry, I can't let
any of you ride it.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.433
- Just a quick spin
around the Milky Way?

09:45.533 --> 09:48.933
- Nora, it's for traveling
through space, not milk.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.300
- The Milky Way
is the name of our galaxy.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.333
- I thought it was Herman.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.267
- Blob-Co built this
to send care packages

09:55.367 --> 09:56.867
to my space station.

09:56.967 --> 10:00.900
That's right,
I have a space station.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.967
- Let's blast it, already!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.633
- On the count of three--
- NORA: Three!

10:20.733 --> 10:22.700
Oh, no!

10:22.800 --> 10:24.533
Did she get in
the rocket?

10:24.633 --> 10:27.733
- ALL: Chloe-e-e-e-e!

10:27.833 --> 10:30.133
- She belongs to
Herman now.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.300
- I have to save her.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.267
She must be so scared.

10:39.933 --> 10:44.767
- I know. We were
a terrible couple.

10:44.867 --> 10:48.333
- You can do better.

10:48.433 --> 10:52.267
- Soon they will see Colosso
is a more responsible

10:52.367 --> 10:56.700
babysitter than
Blobbin will ever be!

10:56.800 --> 11:00.067
Don't touch that!

11:00.133 --> 11:06.567
- *

11:06.667 --> 11:09.767
Hey.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.200
- Hank, please don't
tell me I got dressed up

11:11.300 --> 11:14.900
so we could eat
at Splatburger.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.400
- Got ya!

11:19.200 --> 11:22.233
Oh, no, no, we are
eating someplace nice.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.933
Cancel my tube.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.533
- And, if you press these two
buttons at the same time,

11:31.633 --> 11:33.233
it'll order fresh vegetables

11:33.333 --> 11:35.467
for all these stinking
meat-eaters!

11:39.733 --> 11:43.333
- Whoa. You just
made vegetables cool.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.100
- So, Phoebe said
you invented a way

11:45.200 --> 11:48.167
to use hamsters as
a clean energy source?

11:48.267 --> 11:50.767
- Hm, no. I invented
a way to enslave them

11:50.867 --> 11:53.133
to run a doomsday device.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.267
- You can't enslave hamsters.

11:55.367 --> 11:56.733
- Actually, they'll do
just about anything

11:56.833 --> 11:59.067
for a pocket full
of raisins.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.067
- Oh, my gosh,
you're a madman.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.433
- You know, for someone
who has a crush on me,

12:04.533 --> 12:06.067
you sure are fight-picky.

12:06.133 --> 12:09.167
I do not
have a crush on you.

12:09.267 --> 12:11.367
Phoebe said you
had a crush on me.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.367
- Ha! Not a chance.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.400
- A simple "no" would
have been just fine.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.800
Why would she lie to
get us on a date?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.067
- Good question.

12:20.133 --> 12:22.400
Let's see where she's
at on the Chirper.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.100
All right and gotcha.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.667
She's at Model U.N.?

12:26.767 --> 12:28.867
Nerd!

12:28.967 --> 12:31.400
- I'm supposed to
be at Model U.N.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.200
- Nerd!

12:34.300 --> 12:36.833
- She said it
was tomorrow.

12:36.933 --> 12:38.367
She tricked me.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.733
- She tricked us both.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.733
We have to get revenge.
- Yes! Revenge!

12:42.833 --> 12:44.900
The polar bears
will not be silenced!

12:45.067 --> 12:46.400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.167
Are you saying you have access
to talking polar bears?

12:49.267 --> 12:52.567
Because we can
use them for revenge.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.433
You're looking at me

12:54.533 --> 12:58.233
like you don't have
talking polar bears.

12:58.333 --> 13:01.300
- *

13:01.400 --> 13:02.800
- Once Oyster finishes
your sandwich,

13:02.900 --> 13:06.667
everyone will sign the treaty
and, boom, world peace.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.800
- Not on Greenland's watch!

13:11.100 --> 13:14.300
- That's right and meet
my Vice-President.

13:15.233 --> 13:20.833
- Hello, international
house of nerds!

13:20.933 --> 13:22.833
- Nations of the world,

13:22.933 --> 13:25.333
Greenland is melting
and it's your fault.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.800
There will be
no world peace

13:26.900 --> 13:29.133
until Russia stops
making oil,

13:29.233 --> 13:30.900
Norway stops making coal,

13:31.067 --> 13:33.100
and Scotland stops
making that face.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.100
- But you keep
making yours.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.433
- Max, please don't
ruin this.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.667
If I don't make peace,
I have to go to night school.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.933
Well, you'll fit right in

13:53.067 --> 13:54.900
with all those creepers
and weirdos.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.800
- Hey, is this
Intro to Pet Groomin'?

13:58.900 --> 14:02.200
- Uh, sorry, night
school starts next week.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.667
- I told you
it was next week!

14:08.700 --> 14:11.567
- I wonder if that guy will take
you to night school prom?

14:14.967 --> 14:17.067
- Allison, I'm so close
to world peace.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.133
What do I have to do
to get you to sign my treaty?

14:19.233 --> 14:21.433
- You don't get it.
I didn't come to sign it.

14:21.533 --> 14:24.900
I came here to tear it up.
- Hey!

14:25.067 --> 14:27.133
You crumpled my treaty.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.633
You're lucky Italy
has a printing press.

14:30.733 --> 14:34.100
- That treaty is written in
the tears of polar bears!

14:34.200 --> 14:36.800
Give up your polluting
ways or no peace!

14:36.900 --> 14:40.167
No way! Polar bears
will make you pay!

14:47.667 --> 14:52.567
- Want me to take
her aside and talk turkey?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.700
- Thanks, but I don't
think you'll have to.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.933
Allison made one mistake--
making Max her V-P.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.233
We just have to
wait patiently

14:59.333 --> 15:01.067
until Max does
something dumb.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.867
And, oh, yeah, see?
There he goes.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.833
- Oyster, Norway
totally stole your doll.

15:14.933 --> 15:16.167
Not cool, Wolfgang.

15:16.267 --> 15:17.833
Vas is dollz zen?

15:19.133 --> 15:22.167
More like Vasis steals it.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.933
- Wolfgang didn't
steal that doll.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.567
Max set him up.

15:27.533 --> 15:28.800
- Crikey!

15:33.533 --> 15:35.300
- We talked about
getting revenge.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.933
- We never said anything
about sabotage.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.800
- It doesn't matter
what ya said,

15:39.900 --> 15:41.600
it's what ya did.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.333
- She's right, Greenland.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.833
Model U.N. does not
tolerate international

15:45.933 --> 15:48.467
backzen stabzen.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.067
You're outta here.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.967
- But I didn't--

15:52.067 --> 15:53.667
- But ya did.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.467
- Thanks a lot, Max.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.067
- All right, who's
ready to celebrate

16:03.100 --> 16:04.533
with some peace cake?

16:04.633 --> 16:06.367
- OTHERS: [cheering,
applauding]

16:06.467 --> 16:10.867
- Oh, how could I launch
Chloe into space?

16:10.967 --> 16:12.967
- Oh, no, it looks like

16:13.067 --> 16:16.400
someone needs to babysit
the babysitter.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.667
- Look for anything
that will shoot Blobbin

16:18.767 --> 16:20.633
into space to save Chloe.

16:20.733 --> 16:21.867
- I found fireworks!

16:21.967 --> 16:24.067
- And I found spray cheese!

16:24.167 --> 16:25.800
- Bring it all!

16:25.900 --> 16:27.733
And grab crackers!

16:31.067 --> 16:33.733
- Okay, Chloe, you can
come out now.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.867
- Not until you
hear the fire engines.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.667
- Allison, wait!

16:45.767 --> 16:48.400
You can't just walk out
on your Vice-President.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.867
- Of course, I can.
You abused my trust.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.900
Now I'm going to
abuse you!

16:53.067 --> 16:54.300
- Ow!

16:54.400 --> 16:58.200
Wait, hold on. It's just
some dumb assignment.

16:58.300 --> 17:02.067
- Wow, you sound
just like my parents.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.733
"Why are you always trying to
save the world, Allison?"

17:04.833 --> 17:08.333
"When are you gonna
grow outta this phase, Allison?"

17:08.433 --> 17:09.933
- They say you're
going through a phase?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.967
- Well, it's not
a phase, is it?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.533
- ALLISON: No, it's not.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.533
The real world needs
all the help it can get--

17:18.633 --> 17:20.700
especially with all
you Thundermans

17:20.800 --> 17:22.367
running around in it.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.600
- What's that
supposed to mean?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.967
- It means you and Phoebe
make me sick.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.400
You're both selfish.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.233
You don't care what you
do or who you hurt,

17:29.333 --> 17:31.633
as long as you get
what you want.

17:34.633 --> 17:37.067
- Okay.

17:37.167 --> 17:40.100
I guess I see where
you're coming from.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.067
It is kinda my fault.

17:42.167 --> 17:45.467
You're sorry?

17:45.567 --> 17:47.100
- Yeah.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.133
And, for the record,

17:49.233 --> 17:51.167
that's not something
I usually say.

17:51.267 --> 17:53.867
- Technically,
you still haven't said it.

17:53.967 --> 17:55.400
- [sighing,
clearing throat]

17:55.500 --> 17:58.567
I'm...
sorry.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.767
- Well, it's kinda
too late.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.533
I'm already kicked
out of the U.N.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.900
- But we can't give up.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.067
Let's go back in there
and talk to Mrs. Austin

18:08.133 --> 18:09.700
and stop the treaty
the right way.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.733
- Why do you care
all of a sudden?

18:12.833 --> 18:14.333
- I care because...

18:14.433 --> 18:16.333
I know what it feels
like to be told

18:16.433 --> 18:18.267
you're going through a phase.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.567
My parents tell me
the exact same thing.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.067
- That you're going
through what--

18:22.167 --> 18:23.333
an awesome hair phase?

18:23.433 --> 18:26.800
Something like that.

18:26.900 --> 18:31.067
So, what do you say
we go back in there?

18:31.133 --> 18:33.500
- Let's do this!

18:33.600 --> 18:37.067
- Wait, so, diggin'
the hair, huh?

18:37.100 --> 18:38.900
- Don't get cocky.

18:44.700 --> 18:49.467
- *

18:49.567 --> 18:51.767
- Are you sure this
is gonna work?

18:51.867 --> 18:54.367
- BILLY & NORA: Nope!

18:54.467 --> 18:57.933
- Start main engines!

18:58.067 --> 19:00.533
- Fire thrusters!

19:03.667 --> 19:06.533
Rocket boosters, go!

19:06.633 --> 19:09.233
- You're indestructible!
You're indestructible!

19:09.333 --> 19:12.167
You're indestructible!

19:12.267 --> 19:14.533
- Hi, guys,
what's goin' on?

19:14.633 --> 19:17.800
- Hold on, Chloe.
We're comin' to save you.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.733
- BILLY, NORA, BLOBBIN:
Chloe!!

19:19.833 --> 19:22.233
- Abort lift off!
Abort lift off!

19:22.333 --> 19:23.367
- It's too late!

19:23.467 --> 19:25.233
- And blast off!

19:31.933 --> 19:34.133
- Yay, Cousin Blobbin!

19:38.200 --> 19:39.767
- Exactly what happens

19:39.867 --> 19:42.767
when you leave your children
with a nincompoop.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.767
- Well, I'll always take
a nincompoop over a villain,

19:45.867 --> 19:49.300
especially an indestructible
one who works for free.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.367
Blobbin, you can babysit
any time you want.

19:52.467 --> 19:53.833
- BILLY & NORA: Yay!

19:53.933 --> 19:55.967
- BLOBBIN: Yaaaaayyy!

19:56.067 --> 19:58.733
- Here come the fire engines!

19:58.833 --> 20:00.667
- I win!

20:00.767 --> 20:04.500
- *

20:04.600 --> 20:07.300
- Australia is dope
to be the last country

20:07.400 --> 20:09.400
to sign this ripper
of a treaty

20:09.500 --> 20:12.000
and bring world
peace, mates!

20:12.100 --> 20:13.267
- Kelsey, stop.

20:13.367 --> 20:16.100
- Looking super
cute--again.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.367
- I'll sign that treaty.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.267
- No treaties
will be signed.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.033
Especially yours, Gideon.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.700
- Phoebe, what are
you doing?

20:24.800 --> 20:26.633
You're this close
to passing.

20:26.733 --> 20:29.133
- I don't deserve to pass.

20:29.233 --> 20:31.267
Nations of the world,

20:31.367 --> 20:34.233
this treaty
is based on lies.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.367
I told Allison that
Model U.N. was cancelled

20:36.467 --> 20:38.233
because I cared more
about my grade

20:38.333 --> 20:40.400
than doing the right thing.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.733
Argentina now stands
with Greenland

20:42.833 --> 20:45.500
in their mission
to save the polar bears.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.900
- You promised us peace cake.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.100
- I threw the cake out.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.300
- No caken, no peace!

20:57.333 --> 20:59.800
- Nobody attacks
a polar bear ally!

20:59.900 --> 21:01.333
- Oh!

21:03.600 --> 21:06.100
- Food now!
- Watch it, Mother Russia!

21:06.200 --> 21:07.567
- What'd you say
about my mother?!

21:07.667 --> 21:09.567
- OYSTER: Whoa!

21:09.667 --> 21:11.100
- ALL: [shouting,
screaming]

21:11.200 --> 21:13.167
- Save the koalas!

21:13.267 --> 21:15.067
- Look at that--

21:15.100 --> 21:18.267
total chaos and I didn't
have to lift a finger.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.267
- Thanks for standing
up for me, Phoebe.

21:20.367 --> 21:22.300
- It was wrong of me
to silence you.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.900
And super wrong of me

21:24.067 --> 21:25.833
to send you on a date
with my butthead brother.

21:25.933 --> 21:28.067
- You see me standing
here, right?

21:28.167 --> 21:30.500
- Uh-huh.
There's the treaty.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.533
Would you like to
do the honors?

21:32.633 --> 21:36.133
- Victory feels so good!

21:36.233 --> 21:38.333
Ow!

21:38.433 --> 21:39.867
A flying shark

21:39.967 --> 21:42.367
I thought you were better
than that, Tonga!

21:42.467 --> 21:45.067
- ALL: [shouting,
chattering]

21:45.167 --> 21:47.067
- I think I like
that girl.

21:47.133 --> 21:48.567
- Me, too.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.333
She deserves a victory.

21:53.233 --> 21:54.833
- Way to go, Canada!

21:54.933 --> 21:57.900
- Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date to finish.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.500
- Viva la Greenland!

22:04.600 --> 22:07.933
- ALL: [shouting,
screaming]

22:10.800 --> 22:26.667
- *
