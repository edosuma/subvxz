WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.205
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:11.312 --> 00:13.714
Oh, Emma?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.449
What?

00:15.483 --> 00:16.517
What is it?

00:16.550 --> 00:17.551
Ja.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.120
Can I do... can
I do something?

00:19.153 --> 00:20.921
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:22.623 --> 00:24.658
What's the problem?
You tell me.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.927
What do you mean?
What's the emergency?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.662
You were like,
"ja, ja!"

00:28.696 --> 00:32.333
Babe, that means
"yes" in Swedish.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.701
I can't believe
you don't know this.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.469
I mean, you've been
here for six months now.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.371
Okay, well where I come from
we only use that sound

00:37.405 --> 00:38.772
when something horrible
is happening,

00:38.806 --> 00:40.141
like someone's having
a heart attack.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.375
Okay, but what sound
do you make

00:41.409 --> 00:42.576
to show that you're
listening, then?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.811
We don't make any sound,

00:43.844 --> 00:45.012
that's the whole point
of listening.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.281
Okay, in Sweden you
need three sounds:

00:47.315 --> 00:50.584
Ja, Mm, and
(Gasp) "Jah".

00:50.618 --> 00:52.720
If you those,
you're all set, okay?

00:54.622 --> 00:58.759
Okay... "ja, mm,

00:58.792 --> 00:59.793
(Gasp) jah."

00:59.827 --> 01:01.729
(Music)

01:01.762 --> 01:04.665
* We're not living in America

01:04.698 --> 01:08.136
* But we're not sorry

01:08.169 --> 01:09.870
* I knew there was something

01:09.903 --> 01:11.972
* That we never had

01:12.005 --> 01:14.908
* We don't worry

01:14.942 --> 01:18.212
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:18.246 --> 01:22.049
* But we're not sorry, no

01:22.082 --> 01:25.519
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:25.553 --> 01:28.322
* We're not sorry

01:28.356 --> 01:29.957
* For you

01:31.459 --> 01:35.596
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:35.629 --> 01:36.564
* Aahh

01:39.467 --> 01:41.869
Okay, which one?

01:41.902 --> 01:45.339
Oh, I... would go
with the... blue one?

01:45.373 --> 01:46.607
Come on,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.476
I'm presenting my report
to the CEO today.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.611
It's a big deal.
Either one is fine.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.313
Gustaf:
I wouldn't wear either of those.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.514
You need to peacock,

01:53.547 --> 01:55.616
like in the game.
You know the book?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.351
Oh, I'm amazed.
You read a book.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.086
No, someone
told me about it.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.355
Gustaf:
You know, when
they go to a bar
to pick up women

02:01.389 --> 02:03.424
they wear something
really colourful and big

02:03.457 --> 02:06.327
like a big cowboy
hat or something.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.996
Bruce?
Actually,
he has a point.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.431
Yeah, I have a point.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.466
Maybe you should
go with something
a little more "oomph".

02:12.500 --> 02:14.368
"Umf".
You think?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.470
If you want to make
an impression.
Impression.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.605
I'll be right back.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.675
I wonder what mom and dad
are doing right now.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.076
They're probably
just eating breakfast.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.111
I bet they're
really sorry

02:24.144 --> 02:26.914
about the way
they treated me.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.115
They look at
the little bowl

02:28.148 --> 02:30.884
that I used to
eat cereals from.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.153
And the little spoon.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.722
And they think about
how they missed

02:34.755 --> 02:37.325
what's really
important in life.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.059
(Sobbing)
Me.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.029
(Sobbing)

02:42.062 --> 02:44.298
Yeah, or they're just
eating breakfast.

02:44.332 --> 02:47.067
You have a cold
heart, Bruce.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.169
How long are you planning
on staying with us?

02:49.203 --> 02:52.273
How long are you planning
on having this apartment?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.542
Okay, what about this one.
Is it to much?

02:54.575 --> 02:59.413
Three words:
Cow, Boy, Hat.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.814
I think it's
perfect, honey.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.383
Thank you.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.219
Hey honey,
you know what?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.054
We should probably
call my parents tonight,

03:07.087 --> 03:08.121
tell them the big news.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.457
Let's not jump the gun.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.092
Let's see if they'll
like the report first.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.327
It's not what
I'm talking about.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.596
No, so what are
you talking about?

03:15.629 --> 03:17.164
We're getting married...?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.899
Oh, the news.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.968
The news!
We're getting married.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.536
We should call
them tonight.
(Loud kiss)

03:22.570 --> 03:23.571
Got to run.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.839
That's what I was...
Okay.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.575
That's what I said.

03:27.608 --> 03:33.681
(Music)

03:33.714 --> 03:35.416
You want to
hang out today?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.185
No, I've got
to take care of
Jason Priestly.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.587
The Beverly Hills guy?

03:39.620 --> 03:40.954
Yeah.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.189
Dylan?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.591
No the other one.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.958
Why do you have
to take care of him?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.694
Because I'm the guy.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.262
What do you mean,
the guy?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.663
You know when
you go to Rome,

03:49.697 --> 03:51.765
there's a guy
that shows you around.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.133
I've never been to Rome.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.235
No but the concept,
the guy who helps you out

03:55.269 --> 03:56.437
when you're in Rome.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.005
That's the guy.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.407
But you live in Stockholm.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.475
Yeah, I'm going to be
the Stockholm guy.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.577
So why do you keep
talking about Rome?

04:03.611 --> 04:06.013
You know what?
Never mind.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.915
Celebrities are going
to pay me a lot of money

04:07.948 --> 04:09.817
to set them up
and show them around.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.953
In Rome?
You know,
forget Rome.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.021
I've been to
Norway once.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.756
That has no relevance
whatsoever.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.124
I am heading this way.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.059
It's a lot of
Norwegians there.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.128
Yeah I...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.262
(Sighing)

04:22.296 --> 04:23.997
Okay, so I was thinking
maybe we would start

04:24.031 --> 04:25.833
at the top of Globen?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.568
They have this
sky-tour up there,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.837
you could see all of
Stockholm from there.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.572
You can see
Kungsholmen,

04:31.605 --> 04:32.773
you can see Norrmalm
and back...

04:32.806 --> 04:35.208
Amy didn't tell you
why I'm here?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.144
No, not specifically.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.414
I'm here for
Ingmar Bergman.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.449
Right... the...

04:41.482 --> 04:42.483
The filmmaker...?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.251
Filmmaker, yeah.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.653
I know who he is.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.220
And I can probably

04:47.254 --> 04:49.657
arrange a meeting
with you and him.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.858
Really?
Yeah.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.092
You could do that?
Yeah,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.126
I'm the guy.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.328
That would be
impressive.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.430
I am impressive.
(Wheezing laugh)

04:56.464 --> 04:57.998
People say that
sometimes.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.601
I mean, I'm the guy
who fixes things for people.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.635
I show them around...

05:01.669 --> 05:04.237
Bergman's dead.
Yep.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.674
He died in 2007.
Right.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.842
That's why it's going
to be a little
more complicated.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.844
Obviously.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.413
So what else
do you want to do?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.848
Well, I'd like to go visit
some of the locations

05:14.882 --> 05:16.950
where he shot his films.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.686
Maybe visit
the island of Fårö.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.288
Yeah, Fårö.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.592
Få-a-å-a-rö-o-ö-o.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.027
That's the island
where Bergman lived.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.429
And died,
because he's dead.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.997
And I mean,
I know it's off season

05:30.030 --> 05:31.399
but maybe you could arrange
a private screening for me

05:31.432 --> 05:32.766
in his theatre there.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.334
I can try to do that.
Yeah, definitely.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.604
And I'd like to meet
somebody that
Bergman worked with,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.171
you know, find out
what he was really like,

05:38.205 --> 05:40.608
how he... how he
talked to actors.
Stuff like that.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.377
Okay, yeah.
I can do that.
I'll make some calls.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.446
Okay, great.
Yeah, great.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.881
And, so, which film
specifically

05:47.915 --> 05:49.617
like, is your
favourite?

05:49.650 --> 05:52.252
I think maybe
the "Seventh Seal".

05:52.285 --> 05:53.454
"Seventh Seal".
Yep.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.688
Me too.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.458
That was the one
with the, uh...

05:57.491 --> 05:59.527
With Bergman's
most famous scene.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.294
With the Knight
playing chess with death.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.363
Chess with death.
(Wheezing)

06:03.397 --> 06:04.932
Who can forget that.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.500
Masterpiece, right?

06:06.534 --> 06:07.701
What did you
like about it?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.769
What did I like
about it?
Yeah.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.838
Hm, everything.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.273
The whole thing.
Start to finish.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.876
It was that moment when
it was like, oh hey,

06:15.909 --> 06:18.311
there's six seals, right?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.713
And then...

06:19.747 --> 06:23.183
"What? Here comes
the seventh seal!"

06:23.216 --> 06:24.652
(Sighing)

06:24.685 --> 06:26.720
The beginning was
also really good
when it... when it started

06:26.754 --> 06:29.457
and you had no idea
what was going to
happen at that point.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.692
End was a little
unexpected...

06:31.725 --> 06:32.926
You haven't seen it,
have you?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.195
I will watch it tonight.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.397
I'll watch it
tonight, I promise!

06:38.699 --> 06:43.837
(Music)

06:43.871 --> 06:46.807
(Speaking in Swedish)

07:25.312 --> 07:27.447
Emma:
And then he tried
to steal my project.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.016
He tried to steal
your project?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.484
Yes and everything
I said,

07:30.518 --> 07:32.653
he repeated, just
to make it seem
like his idea.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.922
Everything you said
he repeated to make
it seem like his idea?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.357
Hey!
Sorry.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.226
Sucks that he's tried
to steal your project

07:39.259 --> 07:41.361
but what does that have to do
with opening doors for people?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.663
isn't that just
common courtesy?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.832
No, that's a sign you
don't see men and women

07:44.865 --> 07:46.233
as true equals.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.836
Huh. You want this
last piece of pie?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.571
This is exactly
what I am talking about.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.605
That's condescending.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.173
It is?
Yeah,

07:53.206 --> 07:55.275
like I need your
approval to take
the last piece of pie.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.545
Like I couldn't take it
myself if I wanted to.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.112
Okay, fine.
Hey!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.515
Now you assume
that you should have
the last piece of pie

08:01.549 --> 08:02.916
just because
you're a man.

08:02.950 --> 08:03.951
You said you didn't
want the pie.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.920
Huh, so typical.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.121
You know what
we should do?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.189
Burn your bras?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.457
We should call
your parents

08:10.490 --> 08:12.125
and tell them that
we're getting married.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.360
No, no, no, no,

08:13.393 --> 08:15.095
that's going to be
like a three-hour project.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.364
Really?
Yeah, it's going to be
a huge deal for them.

08:17.397 --> 08:18.899
Plus I have to watch
this movie tonight.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.467
Yay, movie night.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.903
Yes, "Seven Seals".

08:22.936 --> 08:24.304
By Ingmar Bergman.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.775
No... movie night
for me. At all.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.043
I'm already super
depressed, honey.

08:30.077 --> 08:38.518
(Music)

08:39.987 --> 08:41.154
Okay, I did it.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.923
I saw the whole movie,
everything,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.457
even up to the closing
credits, so go ahead,

08:44.491 --> 08:45.525
ask me anything
about it.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.594
So do I get to meet someone

08:46.627 --> 08:48.128
who actually worked
with Bergman?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.162
(Sighing)
You know what, I tried.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.197
I called around

08:50.230 --> 08:51.431
and everyone
seems to be dead.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.700
It doesn't seem
to be anyone that's...

08:52.733 --> 08:55.202
I thought you
were the guy.
I am the guy.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.137
You know, when
I was in Rome,
there was a guy.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.839
Yeah, I've heard
about the guy in Rome.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.473
He hooked me up
with one of Fellini's
assistant directors.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.209
It took him, like,
five minutes.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.410
Fellini...?

09:03.443 --> 09:04.477
Fellini,
the film director...

09:04.511 --> 09:06.246
Film director,
yes.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.781
"8 1/2",
"Amarcord".

09:07.815 --> 09:09.583
All that stuff.
Yeah.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.785
Do you know if there's
someone else in Stockholm
I can talk to?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.253
Somebody who can actually
make something happen?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.722
No, no, no, no,
I'm the guy.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.157
Okay, I will fix this
for you. Okay?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.726
As Fellini would say:

09:18.759 --> 09:22.462
"Niente problemas."

09:22.495 --> 09:24.131
Because he was...

09:24.164 --> 09:25.866
Italian.
Italian, right?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.434
I'll fix it, okay?

09:27.467 --> 09:28.636
Can I grab a cigarette
off of you?

09:28.669 --> 09:29.603
No.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.373
Mm, hej.
Hej.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.977
(Speaking in Swedish)

11:03.463 --> 11:11.204
(Music)

11:11.238 --> 11:12.605
All right, I'm just
going to say it.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.208
There's a celebrity in town
and I want you to meet him.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.276
An American?

11:16.309 --> 11:17.477
Yeah, it's
Jason Priestly.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.747
Oh my god.
I love his work.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.882
You're a 90210 fan?
No, no.
His film work.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.251
Film work?
(Sounds like "whew")
Jo.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.186
Okay, there's just
one thing, all right?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.088
I need you to pretend
that you're an
assistant director

11:28.121 --> 11:29.990
to Ingmar Bergman.
Oh my god!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.224
I know,
I'm so sorry.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.994
Such an honour,
the role of my life.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.395
Okay, don't
overdo it, okay?

11:35.428 --> 11:37.130
I'm going to tell him
that you only have
15 minutes

11:37.164 --> 11:38.331
and that you're in
the middle of a shoot.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.733
What should I wear?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.835
Are you sure
you can do this?
Jo.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.370
Are you okay?
Jo.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.604
What is that sound?

11:44.637 --> 11:45.806
This? Jo?
Yeah?

11:45.839 --> 11:47.040
It means "yes".

11:47.074 --> 11:48.942
Where?
In northern Sweden.

11:48.976 --> 11:49.977
How long have
you been here?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.245
Oh my god, there's
another sound?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.514
How does it go,
like, shhho?
No.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.548
Pshh.
No.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.583
Shuu?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.551
Hhh!
No, that's not it.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.890
(Speaking in Swedish)

12:49.536 --> 12:54.074
(Music)

12:54.107 --> 12:57.210
You're letting Bengt
play Bergman's
assistant director?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.778
Honey, I had
no choice, okay?

12:58.812 --> 13:00.347
If Jason tells
everyone I'm crap,

13:00.380 --> 13:01.714
then I'm not going
to be the guy,

13:01.748 --> 13:02.950
I'm not going to
have any money,

13:02.983 --> 13:04.517
I'm not going to be
able to contribute...

13:04.551 --> 13:06.453
Shh, shh, shh.
There's Hans.
Bruce:
What?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.021
Emma:
Our CEO at work.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.056
Who?
Hans!

13:09.089 --> 13:12.392
(Speaking in Swedish)

13:23.336 --> 13:24.271
Hi.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.046
Ja-a-a. Psshht.

13:38.618 --> 13:42.789
Emma:
(Laughing)
Mm. Ja-a-a.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.757
(Resumes in Swedish)

13:49.762 --> 13:50.697
Psshht.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.204
Ja-a-a.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.939
What was up with
that "psht" thing?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.507
Ah, you didn't think
I knew that one?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.943
Right? It's from
northern Sweden,
it means yes.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.012
No, it doesn't.
Yes, it does: Psht.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.814
No that's "Jo".
That's what I said.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.883
(Huffing)
What does that mean?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.985
That you're an idiot.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.720
Seriously?

14:13.753 --> 14:21.461
(Music)

14:21.494 --> 14:25.532
We shot the theatre scenes
in "Fanny and Alexander"
in this studio.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.666
Jason:
Wow.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.237
So, what was he like
to work with?

14:30.270 --> 14:33.006
Well I have to say,
he was a bit tired.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.309
You know, this was
his last film so,

14:36.343 --> 14:38.578
he left a lot
of decisions
to me, actually.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.847
He did?
Yeah.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.749
You know, I love
"Fanny and Alexander".

14:42.782 --> 14:45.185
I love the juxtaposition
of darkness and light.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.920
Thank you, Jason.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.689
It was much darker
at first.
It was?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.125
Yeah. Then
I said to him,
"Bergie!

14:52.159 --> 14:54.227
"You got to stop
that depressing crap.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.496
You're a funny guy,
make them laugh
for once."

14:56.529 --> 14:59.432
Then he said,
"But, Bengt, I'm the
prince of darkness."

14:59.466 --> 15:01.868
I told him,
"No, you're not.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.705
I'm the master blender
of dark and light."

15:05.738 --> 15:08.475
And then he changed
the script.
Really?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.743
Okay, I think they need
you back on set now.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.680
No, they called me,
the shoot is cancelled
today, so no hurry.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.747
Yeah, but then
they called me

15:14.781 --> 15:16.316
and they said the shoot
is back on, so.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.450
And when was that?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.252
After they called you.
Don't think so.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.054
Anyway,
where were we?

15:21.088 --> 15:22.455
You were telling
me how...

15:22.489 --> 15:23.790
I'm sorry,
I just need to talk
to him for one second.

15:23.823 --> 15:24.924
I'm sorry, Jason.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.395
Okay, you have
to leave now.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.862
He's getting
suspicious.
No way.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.131
Are you kidding?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.365
You told him
you practically
directed the movie,

15:32.399 --> 15:33.866
you don't think
he's getting suspicious?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.368
I didn't say
I directed it.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.704
I was very clear
I was just an
assistant director.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.939
Although in reality
I think a little
lot more than that.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.042
Oh my god, now you're
starting to believe
your own lies.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.776
It's called
method acting, Bruce.

15:43.810 --> 15:44.877
All the great
ones do it.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.713
Stallone,
Schwarzenegger,
Van Damme.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.648
Okay, you have
to leave now.

15:48.681 --> 15:49.849
Remember who
you're talking to.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.084
I know exactly
who I'm talking to.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.185
It's uncle Bengt!

15:52.219 --> 15:54.021
Assistant director
to Ingmar Bergman.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.123
I demand you to treat
me with respect!

15:56.156 --> 15:58.891
You're not an assistant
director, you've never...
you're nothing.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.161
This is ridiculous.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.462
What's going on here?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.433
Okay...
(Sighing)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.635
You know what,
I'm going to have
to come clean.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.203
Listen...
No!

16:10.237 --> 16:11.404
You listen.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.041
This man worked
for Ingmar Bergman,

16:14.074 --> 16:17.144
one of the greatest
filmmakers of all time.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.612
You better start showing
him a little respect.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.750
Okay.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.685
You're right,
I was out of line.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.719
I'm sorry.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.988
Well, nobody's perfect.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.557
Osgood Fielding,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.792
"Some Like it Hot",
director?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.027
Billy Wilder.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.996
Yeah. Just go and
get us some coffee.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.702
Okay, coffee
coming right up.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.437
Did I hear "Sir"?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.373
Hey, don't push it...

16:46.406 --> 16:47.340
s-sir.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.179
Uh...

16:52.212 --> 16:55.148
(Speaking in Swedish)

16:58.951 --> 17:01.020
(Sucking noises)

17:47.767 --> 17:50.703
(Tablet ringing)

17:54.541 --> 17:55.742
Gustaf's crib, yo.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.678
Oh. Gustaf.
Hi, it's Nancy.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.247
Hi.
Hi.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.882
Is, uh, is Bruce
there? I'd like
to talk to Bruce.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.285
Yeah, he lives here too
but he's not at home.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.686
They're really
busy right now.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.489
Oh, well I guess so,

18:09.522 --> 18:13.660
because I keep trying
to call him and
he's never home.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.728
It's the wedding
and everything, you know?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.865
Right, the wedding.
Whose wedding?

18:18.898 --> 18:21.301
Their wedding,
Bruce and Emma's.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.035
Say again?
Their wedding.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.937
Wedding,
Bruce and Emma's.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.740
Bruce and Emma?
Yeah.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.108
They're getting
married?

18:29.142 --> 18:31.043
Yeah, they haven't
told you?

18:31.077 --> 18:32.945
No, we haven't
heard a thing.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.681
Wow, that's crazy.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.949
It's almost like
they're trying to keep
it a secret from you.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.685
Are they mad at you
or something?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.454
Well, gosh
darn it! Wayne!

18:41.488 --> 18:42.855
They're getting
married!

18:42.889 --> 18:46.326
Hello? Bruce mom?

18:46.359 --> 18:47.727
Bruce mom,
I have to ask you.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.630
Is... is marijuana
legal where you live?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.267
(Knocking on door)

18:55.768 --> 18:58.705
(Speaking in Swedish)

19:35.742 --> 19:37.210
(Tapping)

19:51.324 --> 19:52.792
(Imitating cocking
and shooting a shotgun)

19:55.328 --> 19:58.164
(Imitating thump of a
rocket-propelled launcher)

19:58.197 --> 20:01.033
(Imitating click, explosion)

20:01.067 --> 20:03.002
(Laughing)

20:10.610 --> 20:11.644
(Door closing)

20:11.678 --> 20:13.380
Bruce:
Honey, I'm home.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.947
Hello.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.384
Hey. Wow,
look at this.
Yeah.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.351
Look at you.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.853
We're celebrating
something?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.154
Well nothing special,

20:22.188 --> 20:23.990
just that I have the best
boyfriend in the world

20:24.023 --> 20:27.460
and that I will be
on the board of
directors some day.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.362
Wow! Great.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.397
And I'm still the guy.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.964
No way!
Way.

20:31.998 --> 20:35.268
And right now, the guy
just wants to have dinner
with his girl,

20:35.302 --> 20:36.336
please.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.938
(Door opening)
Ohh, god!

20:38.971 --> 20:41.541
I must have slept
for like, five, hours.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.742
What's for dinner?

20:42.775 --> 20:45.545
Um, I actually planned
candle light dinner.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.579
Great.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.848
For the two of us.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.618
Why? Is Bruce
going somewhere?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.052
For me and Bruce,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.254
so you have to go away
for a couple of hours.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.792
This is so unfair.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.762
You don't appreciate
all the stuff I do for you.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.532
Like... what?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.933
Like...

21:06.966 --> 21:09.001
Like today,
your mom called

21:09.035 --> 21:10.570
and I told her that
you're getting married

21:10.603 --> 21:13.540
and she was really upset
because she hasn't
heard from you

21:13.573 --> 21:14.574
and I tried
to console her.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.975
No, no, no, no,
oh god no.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.077
That... that
is so bad.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.979
Do I hear a thank you?

21:20.012 --> 21:23.616
No, I got to
call my mother.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.518
So...

21:25.552 --> 21:27.219
does this mean
I can have dinner?

21:27.253 --> 21:28.187
(In Swedish)

21:37.564 --> 21:38.931
Nancy: (On phone)
You're getting married.

21:38.965 --> 21:39.966
Mm-hm.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.534
Without telling
me or your dad.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.769
Mm-hm.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.004
I mean, what kind of
a crazy person are you?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.573
What have we done?
Ja.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.307
What have we done
to deserve this?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.709
Just tell me why...
Ja.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.778
you think so little
of me and daddy.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.080
What were you doing
that was so important

21:54.113 --> 21:56.148
that you didn't have time...

21:56.182 --> 21:57.550
Jo.
...to call
your mother.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.786
And tell her that
you were getting married.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.220
Shooo.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.722
Wait a minute, I think
the line is breaking up.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.858
I'm hearing like
a strange shushing sound.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.293
Shooo.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.161
Is that...
Can you hear that?
Shooo.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.530
It's all I'm hearing now.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.964
Can you hear that sound?
Shooo.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.900
Is there water rushing in?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.903
It sounds like a water
rushing in sound, Bruce.
Shooo.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.905
(Sobbing)
Bruce, are you okay?
Ja.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.874
* We're not living in America
