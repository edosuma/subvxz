01:42.701 --> 01:43.701
You know,
I just realized

01:43.701 --> 01:45.100
that we've got
someone in this house

01:45.100 --> 01:46.968
that eats,
lies around all day,

01:46.968 --> 01:49.767
and does
absolutely nothing.

01:49.767 --> 01:52.200
Aw, Buck is cute.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.334
I was talking
about you, Peg.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.934
But the dog's
pretty useless too.

01:59.934 --> 02:01.834
You know, something else
just dawned on me.

02:01.834 --> 02:05.334
That people can shower
during the week?

02:05.334 --> 02:07.634
No, love of my life.

02:07.634 --> 02:09.434
No, that there's no one
in this damn house

02:09.434 --> 02:10.701
does anything for me.

02:10.701 --> 02:12.100
Now, I'm the breadwinner.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.133
I deserve better treatment.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.767

02:14.767 --> 02:16.534
The next time
I come home from work,

02:16.534 --> 02:19.267
I want someone
to bring me my slippers.

02:19.267 --> 02:20.467
The question is who.

02:20.467 --> 02:23.701
Actually, when it comes
to your slippers,

02:23.701 --> 02:27.067
the question is how...

02:27.067 --> 02:29.734
As in how can a man
make his slippers

02:29.734 --> 02:33.167
smell even worse
than his feet?

02:33.167 --> 02:37.334
Hey, I sweat the sweat
of the dead, Peg.

02:37.334 --> 02:38.567
Anyhow, getting back

02:38.567 --> 02:40.734
to who's going to bring me
my slippers, you...

02:40.734 --> 02:42.067
Well, I think
you're untrainable.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.801
The kids don't care
if I live or die,

02:45.801 --> 02:48.534
so...I guess that leaves Buck.

02:48.534 --> 02:50.601
Maybe everybody can learn
from him.

02:50.601 --> 02:55.400
Well, that is how
we toilet-trained the kids.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.601
Of course, Bud was 5

02:57.601 --> 02:59.100
before he stopped
getting excited

02:59.100 --> 03:00.601
every time he saw a tree.

[BOTH LAUGH]

in kindergarten are for.

Now, Buck,

03:10.167 --> 03:12.334
you just saw Rin Tin Tin
save an entire nation.

03:12.334 --> 03:14.400
Pretty inspiring, wasn't it?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
The least you can do

03:15.400 --> 03:17.000
is lift your head
and look at me,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.467
you shiftless, lazy--

03:18.467 --> 03:19.467
I can't believe it.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.667
You must be the laziest dog--

03:20.667 --> 03:22.801
Where does he learn this from?

03:24.934 --> 03:27.834
Peg, get up.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.434
Is dinner ready?

03:30.434 --> 03:32.334
Buck, you're gonna learn
to get Daddy's slippers.

03:32.334 --> 03:35.601
Now, I'm gonna pretend
that I just got home from work.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.400

Oh, boy, am I tired.

03:57.234 --> 03:59.234

03:59.234 --> 04:01.434
Boy, would I like to have
some slippers

04:01.434 --> 04:03.167
to go on my feet.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.534
Al, forget about the dog.

04:10.534 --> 04:12.501
So you said you made 75 cents?

04:12.501 --> 04:14.000
Oh, God.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.968
Peg, I'm not giving up.

04:16.968 --> 04:17.968
See the problem is

04:17.968 --> 04:19.000
Buck doesn't know
my slippers,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.666
so I'm going to
show them to him

04:20.666 --> 04:22.000
and then give him
the scent.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.567
Honey...

04:23.567 --> 04:27.434
the whole neighborhood
knows the smell of your feet.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.634
Remember that incident

04:28.634 --> 04:31.634
with the burning Air Wick
on the front lawn?

04:31.634 --> 04:33.367
Go ahead, yuk it up, Peg,

04:33.367 --> 04:35.367
but as soon as Buck learns
how to make Tang,

04:35.367 --> 04:37.167
you're on the first bus.

04:39.501 --> 04:40.534

04:40.534 --> 04:41.734
why is Buck
rubbing his nose

04:41.734 --> 04:44.234
back and forth
on the ground?

04:44.234 --> 04:47.601
It's a sign of pride
in male dogs.

04:47.601 --> 04:48.968
How was school today, Bud?

04:48.968 --> 04:50.767
Not that I care.

04:50.767 --> 04:52.601
I'm glad
that you asked that, Dad,

04:52.601 --> 04:54.200
because I'm not being
all I can be.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.434
Now, you know what
we need in this house?

04:56.434 --> 04:59.167

coming through the vents?

04:59.167 --> 05:00.934
He only thinks
of himself.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.534
What do we need, dear?

05:02.534 --> 05:04.367
A computer.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.367
Okay.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.734
Al, write him
a check.

05:07.734 --> 05:08.734
Oh, yeah, sure.

05:08.734 --> 05:09.901
Hey, even better,
you know,

05:09.901 --> 05:11.901
go to the vault
where we keep the gold bars

05:11.901 --> 05:14.801
and chip off what you need.

05:14.801 --> 05:16.801
If anybody wants me,
I'll be at the country club.

05:16.801 --> 05:20.601

Don't you want Bud

05:25.567 --> 05:27.634
to have all the things
you never had?

05:27.634 --> 05:30.000
You know, an education,
a good job,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.467
a happy wife?

05:31.467 --> 05:34.901
You can't tell me that seeing
me up to my armpits in misery

05:34.901 --> 05:35.767
doesn't make you happy.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.000
Now, we're not
getting a computer.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.434
Computers are ruining
the country.

05:40.434 --> 05:42.767
Computers and women.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.434
Yes, and they're
quite similar, Al,

05:45.434 --> 05:48.467
because you don't know
how to turn on either one.

05:51.801 --> 05:55.000
I'm not interested
in either one.

05:56.601 --> 05:58.234
Mom, can I have
a computer?

05:58.234 --> 05:59.767
Of course
you can, dear.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.000
What color
would you like?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I must be dead.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.734
I speak.
No one hears me.

06:04.734 --> 06:07.734
Al, we have to get Bud
a computer.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.534
He has a chance to be
the first Bundy ever

06:10.534 --> 06:11.534

06:11.534 --> 06:13.567
My Uncle Edwin went to college.

06:13.567 --> 06:18.634
He was a cadaver
for the pre-med students.

06:18.634 --> 06:20.167
and what about Kelly?

06:20.167 --> 06:21.467
She could use one.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.567
You know, she might wanna
go to college, you know?

06:23.567 --> 06:26.300
Oh, God.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.267
Remedial reading
test tomorrow.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
I mean, what do I care

06:31.200 --> 06:34.033
if Jack and Jill
fell down a hall?

06:36.901 --> 06:39.234
I mean, why were they
even in the building?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.634
Kelly, we're getting
a computer.

06:45.634 --> 06:47.267
Oh, cool.
What color?

06:47.267 --> 06:49.601
Well, I was
thinking blue.

06:49.601 --> 06:51.200
You know,
we really need one too.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.367
What do they do?

06:55.501 --> 06:57.400
Al, do you know

06:57.400 --> 07:00.501
your dog is burying himself
in your backyard?

07:00.501 --> 07:01.734
Well, I hope

07:01.734 --> 07:03.133
it's not the spot
by the hose,

07:03.133 --> 07:05.567
because that
little plot's for me.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.200
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades,
we're getting a computer.

07:08.200 --> 07:13.534
Oh, Steve, a computer.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.934
I remember
our first computer.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.701
To buy it, we each decided
to give up something,

07:18.701 --> 07:20.067
to sacrifice,

07:20.067 --> 07:21.667
so that we could have
our little computer.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.934
Steve gave up
getting a new car

07:23.934 --> 07:25.734
for another year, and I--

07:25.734 --> 07:28.534
I gave up my class
on napkin-folding.

07:32.167 --> 07:34.067
Steve just let me.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.267
Now he's got
a new Mercedes,

07:35.267 --> 07:38.267
and I'll never know
how to make a napkin hat.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.901
Thanks, Steve.

07:40.901 --> 07:45.467
But I'm working
that out in therapy.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.100
Meantime, you're
getting a computer?

07:50.534 --> 07:51.801
We don't need a computer

07:51.801 --> 07:53.200
And I'll tell you
what would happen

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
if we got one.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.601
Just like
when we had the kids,

07:55.601 --> 07:57.734
everybody oohs and ahs
the first couple of days.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.534
Then after
the novelty wears off,

07:59.534 --> 08:00.801
it just sits there,
collects dust,

08:00.801 --> 08:03.334
and cries for food.

08:03.334 --> 08:05.868
No, I'm telling you,
nobody needs kids.

08:05.868 --> 08:08.834
No. I mean,
a computer.

08:11.334 --> 08:14.100
I used to be like you, Al.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.667
Well, not just like you.

08:15.667 --> 08:21.701
I mean, I cared about
personal hygiene and...

08:21.701 --> 08:24.601
had change for a dollar...

08:24.601 --> 08:26.601
but I too
doubted the computer.

08:26.601 --> 08:27.767
No longer, Al.

08:27.767 --> 08:29.968
The computer
can be your friend...

08:29.968 --> 08:31.033
especially
on those long nights

08:31.033 --> 08:32.433
when your wife
isn't talking to you

08:32.433 --> 08:33.833
because you can't
fold a stinkin' napkin.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.534
Well, I need something
on those long nights

08:37.534 --> 08:40.734
when my wife
is talking to me.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.967
Much like a family,
what will a computer do for me?

08:42.967 --> 08:44.801
It can do all sorts of things,

08:44.801 --> 08:46.367
like keeping up
with sports scores.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.868
Newspaper.

08:47.868 --> 08:48.868
Social events.

08:48.868 --> 08:50.868
 <i>TV Guide.</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:55.834
Organizing recipes.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.934
Don't eat.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.801
Doctors' appointments.

09:01.801 --> 09:04.267
Don't care.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.334
Maybe we're talking
to the wrong person.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.334
Peggy, a computer can be

09:07.334 --> 09:08.734
the most wonderful thing
in the world.

09:08.734 --> 09:10.033
I'm sold.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.067
No, really--

09:11.067 --> 09:12.100
I don't care.
I'm sold.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.400
Let's get one.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.734
Hey...

09:14.734 --> 09:16.501
Hey, I make the decisions
around here...

09:16.501 --> 09:17.701
BUD: I want
a laser printer.

09:17.701 --> 09:18.868
And I'm telling you

09:18.868 --> 09:20.701
that there will not be
any computers in this--

09:20.701 --> 09:23.701
And I want my dinner.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.901
And my slippers.

09:25.901 --> 09:29.067
Because I'm the boss here,
damn it!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.801
At least there's one place
that I'm still the king.

09:44.734 --> 09:48.868
Boy, what a hard day at work
I had today.

09:48.868 --> 09:52.667
My feet are killing me.

09:52.667 --> 09:56.434
Wish I had some nice slippers
to put them in.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.534
Well, it's not quite it, Buck,

10:06.534 --> 10:09.367
but try to remember this
for when we go to the beach.

10:11.501 --> 10:13.501
Okay, I don't think
I'm explaining it to you right.

10:13.501 --> 10:15.567
Come on up here on the couch.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.400
Good boy. Stay.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.701
I'm gonna go over here
and show you how it's done.

10:20.701 --> 10:22.734
You stay there and be me.

10:22.734 --> 10:26.234
I'll show you
what a real dog's like.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.267
Oh, look, my master's home.

10:28.267 --> 10:31.634
Curse the luck that brought him
to that foul woman.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.334
I'll bet he'd be
much more comfortable

10:35.334 --> 10:36.534
with his slippers.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.400
I'll go get them for him.

10:44.968 --> 10:47.033
See?

10:47.033 --> 10:48.667
See?

10:48.667 --> 10:49.567
Huh?

10:55.067 --> 10:56.734
Um, Mom...

10:56.734 --> 10:59.934
is this truly the end?

10:59.934 --> 11:02.801
Because if it is,
I'm not walking him.

11:02.801 --> 11:04.667
Don't worry, honey.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.667
If Daddy the dog
is anything like Daddy the man,

11:07.667 --> 11:09.467
he'll just put a newspaper
under his paw

11:09.467 --> 11:12.167
and lock himself in a tree
for an hour.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.434
Dad, wait till you see
what we got.

11:18.434 --> 11:19.434
Al, you're
gonna be proud

11:19.434 --> 11:20.434
of what I did.

11:20.434 --> 11:22.234
I saved you $200.

11:22.234 --> 11:24.200
Thanks, Steve.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.834
Yep, they wouldn't
give you anything off

11:25.834 --> 11:27.033
on the $1200 model,

11:27.033 --> 11:28.400
so I said,
"No way, Jos\

11:28.400 --> 11:30.767
I am not leaving here
without a discount."

11:30.767 --> 11:31.767
So I got them

11:31.767 --> 11:34.167
to give you
a $200 rebate

11:34.167 --> 11:37.167
on this $2100 model.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.501
Peg, you spent $1900?

11:43.501 --> 11:46.467
No. I spent $2100,

11:46.467 --> 11:48.634
because with the $200
we saved you,

11:48.634 --> 11:52.033
I bought this dress.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.667
So, actually,
this dress was free.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.300
And you got
a $200 rebate.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.567
Yeah, I guess that's what
my horoscope meant

12:04.567 --> 12:08.200
when it said, "Kaboom."

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
Al, what you're overlooking

12:09.200 --> 12:11.601
is all the things
this model can do.

12:11.601 --> 12:14.167
This...is a muscle machine.

12:45.968 --> 12:47.067

we're flat broke

why we need it.

he's hiding money from us.

dust it off, though.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.834
 <i>Okay, I'll just sit here</i>

20:54.834 --> 20:55.868
 <i>and run</i>
 <i>your electricity bill</i>

20:55.868 --> 20:57.133
 <i>through the roof.</i>

20:57.133 --> 20:58.133
 <i>* Dum-dee-dum **</i>

20:58.133 --> 20:59.133
 <i>That's about a quarter.</i>

20:59.133 --> 21:00.133
 <i>* Doo-dee-doody-doo **</i>

21:00.133 --> 21:01.200
 <i>37 cents.</i>

21:01.200 --> 21:03.601
 <i>Whoa! Ho, that's</i>
 <i>a power surge.</i>

21:03.601 --> 21:05.734
 <i>That's a buck.</i>

21:05.734 --> 21:07.567
 <i>Felt good, though.</i>

21:07.567 --> 21:09.067
 <i>Aw, come on, Al.</i>

21:09.067 --> 21:10.334
 <i>It's not just you.</i>

21:10.334 --> 21:11.467
 <i>Me and my kind</i>

21:11.467 --> 21:13.567
 <i>are really of no use</i>
 <i>to a regular family.</i>

21:13.567 --> 21:15.467
 <i>I'm the pet rock</i>
 <i>of the '80s, buddy.</i>

21:15.467 --> 21:16.667
 <i>[CHUCKLES]</i>

21:16.667 --> 21:18.634
 <i>Aw, come back, Al.</i>

21:18.634 --> 21:20.567
 <i>I really can do great things.</i>

21:20.567 --> 21:21.868
 <i>Listen,</i>

21:21.868 --> 21:23.667
 <i>why did the shoe salesman</i>
 <i>buy a computer?</i>

21:23.667 --> 21:24.901
 <i>Give up?</i>

21:24.901 --> 21:26.834
 <i>Because he's married to</i>
 <i>an idiot.</i>

21:26.834 --> 21:28.701
 <i>[LAUGHS]</i>

21:30.701 --> 21:32.734
 <i>Al.</i>

21:32.734 --> 21:34.934
 <i>What are you doing?</i>

21:34.934 --> 21:36.167
 <i>Peggy?</i>

21:36.167 --> 21:37.334
 <i>Kids?!</i>

21:37.334 --> 21:38.534
 <i>What am I worried about?</i>

21:38.534 --> 21:39.601
 <i>No one's stupid enough</i>

21:39.601 --> 21:40.467
 <i>to break a $2500--</i>

21:53.701 --> 21:55.067
Now...

21:55.067 --> 21:58.601
Let's talk about
those slippers.

22:03.534 --> 22:05.901
* Dum-dee-dum-dee
Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum *

22:09.133 --> 22:11.467
* Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum **

22:21.801 --> 22:23.367
[SIGHS]

22:25.367 --> 22:29.100
Now...I am truly king.

22:41.801 --> 22:43.834
