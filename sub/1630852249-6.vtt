WEBVTT

00:24.280 --> 00:25.800
What are you doing?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.720
Have you been revising all night?

00:27.720 --> 00:30.200
My history dates!
Oh, no!

00:30.200 --> 00:31.680
Let me help. Sorry.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.480
Leave them.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.600
Where's the fire? There is no fire,
Alicia, just a beautiful day

00:40.600 --> 00:44.080
with a challenging test
to look forward to.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.200
And against my better judgment,
Miss Grayling has decided

00:48.200 --> 00:50.640
that the half term dance...

00:50.640 --> 00:52.080
..WILL go ahead later.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.920
Matron, can we play this? It's super
snappy, so even you'll be dancing.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.880
Hmm.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.920
I think a sedate bit of waltzing
will do for you, madam.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.920
Ellen, come on.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.040
You must know it all now.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.160
Poor you. It must be rotten
being a scholarship girl.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.760
Excuse me?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.320
Only you have to come top.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.960
One bad result, and, well,
it's bye-bye, Ellen.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.120
Breakfast? Uh, one second,
can you look at this?

01:59.880 --> 02:03.640
"How to save Malory Towers."
One, find Lady Jane's treasure,

02:03.640 --> 02:06.320
"2, write to parents asking them
to donate."

02:06.320 --> 02:11.080
That's a great idea. Except
it's still a secret, so we can't.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.960
And then Gwen told me...
Told you what?

02:13.960 --> 02:17.280
Gwen, diaries are private.
Not if they're about me.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.280
Anyone could read it and find out.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.160
Find out what?
Gwen, I was winding you up.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.320
Come on, Sally.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.560
Ellen, buck up, you can't miss
breakfast, it's not allowed.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.320
But the test. History dates
are bound to come up.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.280
Can you cover for me, please?

02:44.280 --> 02:45.800
I have to do well.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.480
My aunt said I'd never get
a scholarship here, but I did.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.920
I got here.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.080
I can't go back.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.560
If I do, I'm stuck looking
after her forever.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.880
She doesn't even like me.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.240
I'll cover.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.440
I'll bring some toast back. Thanks.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.800
"Richard I - 1189 to 1199.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.680
"King John, 1199 to 12...

03:16.200 --> 03:18.480
..16."

03:18.480 --> 03:21.320
OFF-SCREEN: Ellen's looking terribly
dead. She must be really tired.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.680
I told you about my father
in the strictest confidence.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.240
And I only told Mary Lou
because I thought it would help.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.920
And now you've written it
in your diary.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.000
Will you stop going on about
my diary. The only people I know are

03:33.000 --> 03:35.680
me, you, Mary Lou - nobody else.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.840
Oh, Gwen, I've managed to mislay
that half crown Miss Grayling

03:43.840 --> 03:45.440
gave you for costumes and props.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.560
There's a sherbet Dip Dab
for whoever finds it.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.760
Spread the word. Will do.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.520
Oh, how's your father? Any news?

03:51.520 --> 03:55.680
Ever so sweet of you to ask, but I'd
really rather not talk about it.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.080
Understood. Chin up.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.480
Well, let...let's run lines
after class, and you'll need to get

03:59.480 --> 04:02.080
started on the posters, too.
They really should be up by now.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.680
Oh, and programme notes?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.560
Good luck with the test.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.200
Who's that for?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.600
Who's what for?

04:15.360 --> 04:18.640
Ellen Wilson, I have not seen her
eating breakfast, where is she?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.840
She came down really early.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.800
You must have passed her
in the corridor. Mm.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.120
You're bound to ace this.
You've worked so hard.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.600
So, the moment of truth.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.680
If everybody's ready,
you may turn your papers

04:48.680 --> 04:50.400
over and start the test.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.160
SHE HUMS TO HERSELF

05:43.160 --> 05:50.480
SWING MUSIC PLAYS

05:59.720 --> 06:02.600
# Doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo-doo! #

06:02.600 --> 06:03.880
SHE CHUCKLES

06:03.880 --> 06:07.120
SHE SIGHS

06:22.360 --> 06:26.240
OK, we have just a few
more seconds left.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.560
Time's up, pencils down, please.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.840
Did you finish it?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.120
No.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.960
I really thought I'd flunk it,
but I even had time to check it all.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.200
What did you get for the question
about Newton?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.040
The one with G and acceleration?
Yeah.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.800
I think the G meant gravity.
I put 32 feet per second.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.000
Well, at least I got the gravity
bit.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.400
Actually it's 32 feet
per second per second.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.280
Acceleration is equal to twice
the distance travelled

07:01.280 --> 07:02.600
by the square of time.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.560
You took the words right
out of my mouth.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.640
So, what did you put for the
question on the Trojan War?

07:11.640 --> 07:15.960
What? You know, the same page
as those hideous trig equations?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.800
Trig equations. There weren't any.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.560
Could you have missed a page?

07:21.760 --> 07:24.000
I must have...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.960
..failed. I've actually made...

07:25.960 --> 07:27.480
Oh, it was a mistake - that's all.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.960
I'm sure Mr Parker will understand.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.880
That test was ridiculous. Who cares?
We're free now until the dance.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.680
Gwen? What?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.440
I wasn't doing anything.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.640
You'll be better off
learning your lines.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.120
Come on, let's celebrate.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.680
Miss Rivers, may I request
your hand for a dance?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.960
Gwen, it's private. Hands off.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.320
Gwen, are you ready to rehearse?

08:08.320 --> 08:12.400
Of course. But did you find that
half crown for the costumes?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.440
No, not yet.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.800
Well, we must.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.000
I suppose you're right.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.280
Let's look in the dining hall.
I definitely had it there.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.520
Actually, you make a start
in the classrooms.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.880
Sorry.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.640
Watch it. Sorry.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.720
Everyone, Ellen ran off after the
test. I can't find her anywhere.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.840
Why? She aced it.
Except she didn't.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.560
Poor thing.
She somehow missed a chunk.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.240
That sounds like the sort
of thing I would do.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.640
Oh, should we tell Mr Parker?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.800
No, we should find her first.
She can't have gone far.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.720
Ellen's always wound up tight.
Maybe she just needs some time.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.280
You didn't see how upset she was.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.320
Darrell, Alicia and I will check
outside,

08:51.320 --> 08:53.080
the rest of you,
search the school.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.120
Gwendolyn, what are you doing?

09:05.080 --> 09:07.040
I'm looking for something.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.520
Well, could you look later? I need
some quiet to mark your tests.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.600
Yes.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.440
About that test.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.800
The questions - they just...
They didn't go my way.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.440
Hmm. It's funny how often that
happens to you.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.720
That half a crown?

09:23.720 --> 09:26.760
Is it yours? Only, that's what I've
been looking for.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.760
It was on the floor.
I found it earlier.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.280
It's Georgina's. She's been looking
for it everywhere.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.840
May I take it to her?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.080
OFF-SCREEN: You sure,
we looked everywhere?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.960
OFF-SCREEN: Oh, we haven't tried the
changing rooms. You sure?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.240
Yes, let's try.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.600
She's not here.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.200
Maybe we should check outside again.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.280
Perhaps she's just got her head
stuck in some book.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.080
I hope she doesn't run away. That's
the last thing Miss Grayling needs.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.360
Why?

10:00.360 --> 10:03.200
What's wrong with Miss Grayling?

10:03.200 --> 10:07.080
Uh, maybe, maybe we should just try
the tennis courts again?

10:07.080 --> 10:10.360
Count me out. I've got better things
to do than look for Ellen.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.080
Really, Gwen, you could have started
on the posters.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.240
What are you doing?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.720
I'm looking for the missing money.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.600
Georgina, look. There I found it.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.640
Oh, that's brilliant, Gwen.
You win the sherbet Dip Dab.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.760
Now, we can rehearse.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.360
I can't possibly rehearse.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.320
The dance is soon and Miss
Grayling was most insistent

11:25.320 --> 11:26.760
that we looked our best.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.160
You understand.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.280
I can't possibly let her down.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.280
Well, I suppose
if Miss Grayling said,

11:32.280 --> 11:34.520
but we'll really have to motor
tomorrow.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.000
Absolutely.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.200
Is this yours?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.520
You know, you don't want
to leave a diary around.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.840
Anyone might read it.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.080
You're right. Thank you.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.560
Don't worry. When they make me leave
I'll try and take you, too.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.520
What's wrong?

12:18.520 --> 12:19.880
Nothing.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.800
I could get someone?

12:23.800 --> 12:25.680
I mean, if you want?

12:25.680 --> 12:27.440
No, don't.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.200
I came to see the cat.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.040
I'm fine, honestly.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.720
Ron? Oh, Darrell.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.520
Is everything all right?

13:04.520 --> 13:07.960
I'm not sure. There's a girl.
She's in your year.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.760
She looks really upset.
Wait, is Ellen?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.280
Yeah. We're looking for her.
She's in the potting shed.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.240
Don't worry - we'll sort it.
You're a total brick. Thanks, Ron.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.440
Ellen?

13:20.440 --> 13:23.680
Where have you been?
We've all been looking for you.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.400
Please, just leave me alone.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.360
Well, you really can't stay here.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.800
I failed.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.080
Don't you see? I failed the test.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.960
I can't lose my scholarship.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.400
They'll make me leave.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.240
That would be really rotten
and unfair. We'll speak up for you.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.800
Darrell's right. We will.
Come on.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.200
We really need to get you inside.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.000
"How to save Malory Towers."

15:09.960 --> 15:11.920
Ellen Wilson, why are you shaking
like that?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.960
Maybe she's got a temperature?

15:13.960 --> 15:17.520
Darrell, you're father may well be a
doctor, but you certainly are not.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.560
Everything's gone wrong. Everything.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.360
Well, now, it's the san for you.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.000
Now, don't you worry,
I'll keep an eye on you.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.200
Well, we could come and keep
her company?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.560
Well, she's got me, doesn't she?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.680
Now, you two go and get ready for
the dance.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.120
Now, then, Ellen.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.240
Little bit of quiet time tucked up
warm in bed.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.360
You'll soon be right as rain.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.160
Oh, dear. Come along now.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.640
OFF-SCREEN: No, I was going
to say that.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.480
Someone looks serious.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.320
I'm afraid I am.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.240
There's some terrible news.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.480
We found Ellen.
She was in the potting shed.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.240
What? She's safe now.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.080
We left her with matron.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.040
Give that back.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.120
I will not.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.560
How dare you dabble with us.
Keeping a secret like that.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.680
What secret?

16:09.680 --> 16:11.560
Are you going to tell them,
or shall I?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.760
If it was in Darrell's diary,
you shouldn't have looked.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.560
You'll be pleased I looked
when you hear. Gwen, please stop.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.920
No! I won't!

16:17.920 --> 16:20.480
It was utterly disgraceful
of you to keep this from us.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.520
Seems like we need to know. Gwen?

16:24.880 --> 16:28.000
Miss Grayling's run out of money.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.600
Malory Towers is going to close.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.840
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

16:47.840 --> 16:49.080
Matron?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.320
SHE GASPS

16:57.040 --> 16:59.680
I think you were resting your eyes.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.440
That's it. That's the thing I
do, cos it focuses my thoughts.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.440
I'm just going to have a word
with Ellen.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.680
I've been speaking to Miss Grayling
about you.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.440
We're both of the same mind.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.400
How could I tell you? I shouldn't
have known, let alone all of you.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.200
You see, there it is.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.480
Darrell was only worried about
getting herself into trouble.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.720
How selfish.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.160
That's not fair, Gwen. I knew, too.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.160
You told Sally?!
We both agreed.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.760
We didn't want to scare you all.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.000
That's a lot of worry to carry
around.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.360
You can't feel sorry for them.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.320
You shouldn't have read Darrell's
diary in the first place.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.240
Well, I thought she was writing
about me.

17:44.240 --> 17:48.040
Even if she was, you still shouldn't
have read it.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.880
Of course, take Darrell's side
as usual.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.520
Quelle surprise!

17:58.320 --> 17:59.800
I've let you down.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.800
You and Miss Grayling and Matron
have all been so kind.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.840
Ellen, you need to listen.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.720
Scholarship girls can't fail tests.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.320
You want me to leave, don't you?

18:09.320 --> 18:12.520
Ellen, what did Mr Parker just say?

18:12.520 --> 18:15.520
No-one will ever
take your scholarship.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.120
Really? Miss Grayling and I are
concerned about you, though.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.280
You've had an attack of the nerves.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.920
We understand why you've
concentrated on your classwork,

18:25.920 --> 18:28.560
but being here isn't
just about being clever.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.280
Do you mean sport?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.680
I'm not great at that,
but I will try.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.600
You don't need to get into a team,
Ellen,

18:34.600 --> 18:39.160
but we would like you to be open
to new experiences.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.160
There's far more to Malory Towers
than the classroom, and there's

18:42.160 --> 18:43.920
far more to you, too.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.920
Now, there's to be no more
school work until Matron says so.

18:47.920 --> 18:53.240
You need to get better,
and you need to stop worrying.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.800
And enjoy being here.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.600
The treasure hunt.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.760
It was real, wasn't it?

19:08.760 --> 19:11.200
It really mattered. Well, we
thought if we find the treasure,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.800
we could give it to Miss Grayling.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.440
And save the school.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.880
If it's really as bad as you think,

19:16.880 --> 19:19.240
we'll have to go to new schools.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.800
We'll never see each other.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.000
Don't say that. Miss Grayling
will fight for this.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.720
We just have to trust her.
Darrell's right.

19:25.720 --> 19:30.080
We've still got the dance.
I don't feel like dancing now.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.680
Let's go and see what snacks
they've got.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.360
We need cheering up.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.960
Come on, Jean.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.320
It might really happen, and, then,
unless there's a miracle...

19:50.360 --> 19:52.000
..no more Malory Towers.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.160
SHE SNORES

20:54.320 --> 20:56.080
Pick it up with two fingers.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.760
DOOR CREAKS

21:27.760 --> 21:29.320
DOOR OPENS

21:29.320 --> 21:31.640
Ellen, how are you feeling?

21:31.640 --> 21:32.920
So much better now.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.680
That's why I sneaked out.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.840
Mr Parker says they won't take my
scholarship.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
See, we did try to tell you.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.640
I really did think I had to be
the best.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.600
Well, I'm the best, obviously.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.440
Er, I thought it was me.
What did I get in French again?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.400
Oh yes, D minus.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.680
From now on, I want to be part
of everything.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.960
What is it?
Did I...did I say something wrong?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.880
We've had some bad news.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.160
The school's run out of money.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.440
It might close.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.000
Is that why you're not dancing?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.080
Well, we didn't feel like it.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.280
Well, I think we should.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.720
We deserve to enjoy ourselves even
more so now.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.560
OFF-SCREEN: I have just the thing.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.800
I sneaked into Matron's room
and took this back.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.040
Come on, Darrell.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.640
SWING MUSIC PLAYS

22:32.640 --> 22:34.400
Come on, Ellen.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.240
Come on, Gwen. Who knows when we
might get to dance again?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.080
That's it. Yeah.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.280
THEY GIGGLE

22:50.920 --> 22:52.120
Are we ready?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.320
ALL: Woo!

22:54.320 --> 22:56.160
Again! ALL: Woo!

23:16.240 --> 23:18.040
What in heaven's name?

23:19.760 --> 23:21.200
MUSIC STOPS

23:21.200 --> 23:24.320
I told you to stay in bed.
You need rest.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.400
You should not be galumphing
about with the rest of the dorm.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.640
Isn't this the one I confiscated?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.120
Er, I have a copy, too.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.760
It really is quite the thing,
Matron.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.880
Here, Matron, you simply must try
one.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.360
They're really good.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.920
Matron, I promise I'll rest.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.800
And Miss Grayling was terribly
keen on the dance.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.360
Well, I suppose a bit of dancing
is fine,

23:55.360 --> 23:58.240
as long as Ellen stays on the sofa.

23:58.240 --> 24:02.160
You see, when we work together,
we can do anything.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.760
MUSIC STARTS

24:04.760 --> 24:08.800
Good show!

24:04.760 --> 24:08.800
THEY GIGGLE

24:18.520 --> 24:21.120
THEY LAUGH
