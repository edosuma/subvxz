00:08.667 --> 00:11.542
(male #1)
'10 minutes to the
biggest dance contest'

00:11.625 --> 00:13.166
'South Philly's ever seen.'

00:13.250 --> 00:14.792
'So get those
platforms polished'

00:14.875 --> 00:16.583
'cause it's gonna be far out.'

00:16.667 --> 00:19.250
'The Bell's giving 1000
bucks to the winner.'

00:19.333 --> 00:22.458
'You heard me 1000 big ones!'

00:22.542 --> 00:24.333
Outta sight!

02:27.750 --> 02:29.709
(female #1)
'Gas and Power guys
were fixing a leak'

02:29.792 --> 02:32.333
'found partial remains
about six feet down.'

02:32.417 --> 02:33.583
In an old disco?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.458
Was an old
disco, The Bell.

02:35.542 --> 02:37.375
Off Lansing
Boulevard,
real eyesore?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.875
That's the spot. Twenty two
people were killed there

02:39.959 --> 02:41.667
in a fire, 1978.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.208
Ruled as arson.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.500
Twenty third was presumed dead
remains were never found.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.375
You thinking this
must be the guy?

02:48.458 --> 02:50.709
- John Doe.
- That's all that's left of
him?

02:50.792 --> 02:53.667
Skull's all I need to get an
ID. Man had excellent teeth.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.166
If he burned up in the fire
why
didn't we find him back then?

02:56.250 --> 02:58.125
Well, apparently he
was deep underground

02:58.208 --> 03:01.000
where the VIP room was.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.375
Plus, there's that.

03:03.458 --> 03:07.625
Slug's been rolling
around in his brain
pan.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.417
(Lilly)
'Right between the eyes.'

03:09.500 --> 03:10.875
Shooter must have
been close up.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.792
Can we get rifling
off this slug?

03:12.875 --> 03:14.166
My guess is it's a .38.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.750
Should have
distinctive
markings.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.083
This guy was probably shot
before the fire ever got to
him.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.959
Well, maybe our doer started
the blaze, covered his
tracks.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.834
Hide one murder,
cause 22 others.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.959
We don't got a cold one here.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.625
We got 23 of them.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.458
Dental records
were conclusive.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.417
This is our John Doe.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.959
Benjamin Issac Rosen.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.291
Twenty two.

04:08.375 --> 04:11.041
I remember the news
coverage of The Bell fire.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.333
Cryin' families,
burned bodies.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.500
Bulldozers come in
quick,
demolish the place?

04:15.583 --> 04:17.041
Yeah, what was
left standing

04:17.125 --> 04:19.458
was considered
a safety hazard.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.333
So maybe they did a rush
job finding all the
remains.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.417
Explains why they
didn't find him.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.125
You, uh, ever hang
out
at this disco, boss?

04:28.208 --> 04:30.000
Oh, not me, but I
think Jeffries

04:30.083 --> 04:32.291
was a beat cop
in South at the time.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.333
I wonder what he
did Saturday nights.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.709
<i>a</i>
the

04:38.792 --> 04:40.333
Lines around the
block to get in.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.834
Lot of feathered hair,
gold chains, polyester..

04:43.917 --> 04:47.291
Sounds like you got some
familiarity there, Will.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.000
I was there once.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.458
William Disco Jeffries.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.208
Come on, Will, bust
a move for us.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.709
(Nick)
'Yeah, do the
hustle, baby.'

04:54.792 --> 04:57.875
You know, if it's all
the same, I'd rather not.

04:57.959 --> 05:00.875
Those were regrettable times.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.792
The arson report
says
the blaze started

05:02.875 --> 05:04.542
in the "White Room"
do you know what that
was?

05:04.625 --> 05:06.917
VIP lounge, where all
the cocaine was snorted.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And where Ben Rosen's
remains were found.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.291
So, maybe he
started the fire.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.125
Right after he got
shot in the face?

05:12.208 --> 05:13.500
That's a point.

05:13.583 --> 05:15.750
So who was with Ben
in the White Room?

05:15.834 --> 05:18.500
Chief suspect in the arson
was the owner of the place.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.834
Neil Chaney?

05:19.917 --> 05:21.709
'Torched his own club
for the insurance?'

05:21.792 --> 05:23.417
You'd think he'd wait
till after hours.

05:23.500 --> 05:27.166
Looks like they dug, but
didn't
get far with that theory.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.458
We got partial
rifling on the bullet.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.542
- It was a .38.
- Good enough to find a match?

05:31.625 --> 05:34.583
Yep, we find the gun
that matches this slug

05:34.667 --> 05:35.583
could lead us to the doer.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.417
I'd call that new direction.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.709
Vera, Disco Will

05:38.792 --> 05:41.000
'have a conversation
with Neil Chaney.'

05:41.083 --> 05:43.333
- Meantime..
- We'll go to the Rosens.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.500
(female #2)
'You found Benny..'

05:48.583 --> 05:51.208
...after all these years?

05:51.291 --> 05:53.375
I always hoped, prayed

05:53.458 --> 05:57.709
he got out of that
conflagration somehow.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.667
'Ran away or something.'

06:01.542 --> 06:03.750
Foolish. I know.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.041
Benny lived at
home with you?

06:05.125 --> 06:07.083
He was going to go
to dental school.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.875
'Top of his class.'

06:08.959 --> 06:11.750
Smart. Sweet.

06:11.834 --> 06:14.583
He have any enemies
you know of?

06:14.667 --> 06:16.625
I thought he
died
in the fire.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.709
I'm afraid he was
murdered, Mrs. Rosen..

06:19.792 --> 06:21.125
'...before the fire started.'

06:21.208 --> 06:22.667
Murdered?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.542
Was he in any
kind of trouble?

06:24.625 --> 06:26.458
How should we know?

06:26.542 --> 06:28.458
Benny was an open
book before

06:28.542 --> 06:31.625
he started playing
that so-called
music.

06:31.709 --> 06:35.125
'After, he shut us out.'

06:35.208 --> 06:37.041
He knew we disapproved.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.875
Why? Shouldn't I
have disapproved?

06:39.959 --> 06:42.125
That disco
ruined
his life.

06:42.208 --> 06:46.875
We, uh, kept some of his
things in his room.

06:46.959 --> 06:49.041
Maybe you'd like to see?

07:02.792 --> 07:05.500
Salutatorian of his
high school class.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.041
(Myra)
'Adorable right.'

07:13.125 --> 07:15.625
There something you want
to tell us, Myra?

07:15.709 --> 07:18.709
Something you didn't
want
your husband to hear?

07:18.792 --> 07:20.417
No, of course not.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.917
''Cause I got the
feeling there was.'

07:26.583 --> 07:28.333
We know this is difficult.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.583
Doesn't have to leave this room.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.709
There was something.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.542
It's something I
never told my husband.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.625
What was that?

07:44.709 --> 07:48.125
I came home from temple
early one night, uh..

07:48.208 --> 07:49.917
...on account of my arthritis.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
'This was a week
before the fire.'

07:52.083 --> 07:53.500
'And, uh..'

07:55.625 --> 07:57.625
I saw them together.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.166
'My Benny'

07:59.250 --> 08:02.208
<i>shiksa.</i>

08:02.291 --> 08:03.834
Like you.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.542
- Mmm, not here, baby.
- Come on.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.417
My folks won't be
back for hours.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.250
But if we want to win
this competition

08:35.333 --> 08:36.959
we got to practice.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.458
I don't got the
rhythm
like you do.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.291
You got it where
it counts, baby.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.583
You're far out.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.500
When you gonna tell
your
parents we're engaged?

08:43.583 --> 08:45.375
'Aah, soon.'

08:45.458 --> 08:47.542
You are such a foxy mama.

08:48.792 --> 08:51.417
- Benny.
- Hey.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.917
You know I want
to marry you

08:54.000 --> 08:56.500
spend my whole life
dancin' with you.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
We don't have to make it
now if you don't want to.

09:05.750 --> 09:10.000
We'll practice, then
we'll make it, huh?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.291
I love you, hot stuff.

09:13.709 --> 09:16.125
'They were in love.'

09:16.208 --> 09:20.083
At least my Benny had
that before he died.

09:20.166 --> 09:23.792
Did Benny ever talk about
his wedding plans?

09:23.875 --> 09:25.542
He was probably afraid to.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.458
His father would
have hit the roof.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.458
You know what happened
to this girl, Sonya?

09:30.542 --> 09:33.125
She got burnt in the fire.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.917
I visited her once
at Saint Ignatius..

09:36.000 --> 09:38.542
...she was all doped up.
Never knew I was there.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.959
And your husband still
doesn't know about her?

09:41.041 --> 09:43.125
'He needs more heartache?'

09:43.208 --> 09:47.542
'It's bad enough feeling his
son betrayed him over disco.'

09:59.458 --> 10:01.417
Sonya Witkowski?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.083
Yes.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.583
'Detectives Rush and Valens.'

10:05.667 --> 10:08.250
We're here about
Benjamin Rosen.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.834
Benny?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.250
'I'll be right back.'

10:20.250 --> 10:22.917
I lost Benny in
The Bell fire.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.834
(Scotty)
'Part of his remains were
recently found, Sonya.'

10:25.917 --> 10:30.625
It appears he was killed
before the fire started.

10:30.709 --> 10:33.250
Someone killed him?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.792
I'm afraid so.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.083
'We understand you
two were engaged.'

10:38.166 --> 10:41.291
'We were gonna get married
after the dance competition.'

10:42.458 --> 10:44.834
That was such
a long time
ago.

10:44.917 --> 10:48.417
Was there anything
unusual
going on in Benny's life

10:48.500 --> 10:49.542
right around then?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.208
Fights? A threat?

10:51.291 --> 10:54.750
No. I mean..

10:54.834 --> 10:56.125
You sure
he was murdered?

10:56.208 --> 10:58.750
Anything you can tell
us could really help.

11:01.709 --> 11:05.208
A couple of days
before
the dance contest

11:05.291 --> 11:07.166
I got there
early
to practice..

11:26.166 --> 11:29.250
Hey, foxy mama,
let's hustle.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.750
What did Chaney want?

11:31.834 --> 11:33.959
- Nothing.
- Didn't look like nothing.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.750
Look, are we talking
or are we dancing?

11:35.834 --> 11:37.709
You deal blow for Chaney,
Benny, I'll dump your ass.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.041
I'm not dealin' blow.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.542
I swear.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.834
You wouldn't lie to me?

11:44.917 --> 11:46.792
I'd rather die.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.625
Hey, after we win that 1000
bucks, baby, let's elope.

11:56.709 --> 11:59.917
We'll go to Manhattan, get
married at Studio 54.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.125
- We got to win first.
- We'll win.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.583
You're the best disco
dancer in Philly.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.709
Philly? Is that all?

12:06.792 --> 12:08.709
In America.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.792
The whole world.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.959
He was the love
of my life, you know?

12:16.041 --> 12:17.291
The real deal.

12:17.375 --> 12:20.166
What were Benny,
and Mr. Chaney fighting
about?

12:20.250 --> 12:21.500
I don't know.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.792
Benny used to give
private dance
lessons

12:23.875 --> 12:27.041
to some of Chaney's clients

12:27.125 --> 12:29.208
but it seemed like
something more serious.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.834
Are you sure it ain't
possible
Benny was dealing for him?

12:32.917 --> 12:34.750
He said he wasn't.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.917
On the off chance
that he was, Sonya

12:40.000 --> 12:41.458
you think Chaney
was the kind of man

12:41.542 --> 12:43.709
who could murder someone?

12:43.792 --> 12:46.000
I know he had a gun.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.667
Used to show it off like
some kind of big shot.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.166
We're still looking
for Neil Chaney

12:52.250 --> 12:54.417
but he did have
a permit for a .38.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.208
Which he fired in '77.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.083
Shot a
burglar
at The Bell.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.750
A year before
Benny was shot.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.083
File's coming over from South.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.041
We find the slug he
shot at that burglar

13:03.125 --> 13:04.750
match it to the one
we got on this job.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.917
Makes Chaney a good
bet for the doer.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
We're talking about
finding a bullet

13:08.583 --> 13:10.125
fired 26 years ago
from a gun

13:10.208 --> 13:12.041
we don't even know
exists anymore.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.250
Registered to a
man
we can't find.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.458
'Yeah.'

13:15.542 --> 13:17.709
The word "Longshot"
comes to mind.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.166
We like a challenge.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.875
Well, you got one.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.709
File from South IDs the guy
Chaney shot as Mark Rigley.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.083
Tried to rob a disco at closing.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.083
Chaney popped him.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.625
Shooting was ruled self-defense.

13:36.709 --> 13:38.291
Maybe Rigley knows what
happened to the slug.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.875
- He doin' time someplace?
- Uh-uh.

13:39.959 --> 13:43.208
Custodial detail at the
River Rink, Penn's Landing.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.041
Know how we been having
trouble findin' Chaney?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.542
'It's 'cause County's
six months behind'

13:46.625 --> 13:48.375
processing death certificates.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.417
Chaney's dead?

13:49.500 --> 13:50.458
'Three months ago.'

13:50.542 --> 13:51.583
Cirrhosis of the liver.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.000
- Crap.
- 'So what?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.667
We still have 23
unsolved murders.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.083
We can't talk
to the father we'll settle

13:58.166 --> 13:59.583
for the son, he's
not dead, is he?

13:59.667 --> 14:02.834
No. Paul Chaney owns
a shop in Center City.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.208
Good. Out on the street, boss.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.959
'We should try this.'

14:10.041 --> 14:12.125
'We should give it a try..'

14:14.917 --> 14:16.417
'Uh, excuse me
just one second.'

14:16.500 --> 14:17.875
'Enjoy yourselves.'

14:20.166 --> 14:22.208
What's up, folks?

14:22.291 --> 14:24.417
'You want a pipe?'

14:24.500 --> 14:25.834
Depends what's in it.

14:25.917 --> 14:29.125
Tobacco the new marijuana.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.792
That's far out, Paul.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.417
Tobacco's legal, remember?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.125
Hey, you wanna check
the pipes, be my
guest.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.542
- Uh, we ain't narcs.
- We're homicide.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.667
Homicide? What do
you want with me?

14:41.750 --> 14:44.792
Your father, he had
a permit for a .38.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.458
We thought you might know
where that gun is now.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.041
Uh, excuse me.

14:49.125 --> 14:52.041
You mind just stepping
over here for a second?

14:55.250 --> 14:56.458
Why? What's this about?

14:56.542 --> 14:57.875
The Bell.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.375
A man was killed
there that night

14:59.458 --> 15:00.667
before the
fire broke out.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.291
And you want to
pin
it on my old man

15:02.375 --> 15:03.375
who's trying
to rest in
peace?

15:03.458 --> 15:04.667
We're trying
to solve a murder.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.625
Don't you mean murders?

15:06.709 --> 15:09.500
Look, I been through
this a hundred times.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.166
Twenty three people burned
to the crisp.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.125
Everyone blamed
my dad for it.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.041
That's why he
drank
himself to death.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.125
You don't think he was
responsible?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.333
My father loved The Bell.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.834
The idea of his torching it,
it's just craziness.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.792
So what about that .38, Paul?

15:25.875 --> 15:29.041
I threw it into the
Delaware,
like, a decade ago.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.500
I was worried my dad was
going to turn it on
himself.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.875
You remember a guy
named Benny Rosen?

15:34.959 --> 15:37.500
Yeah, yeah,
sure.
Benny the Rose.

15:37.583 --> 15:38.834
Everybody knew him.

15:38.917 --> 15:41.500
'Someone killed him
that night.'

15:41.583 --> 15:42.667
Shot him.

15:42.750 --> 15:46.333
No.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.834
Well, come on.
It wasn't my
dad.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.333
I was by his side the whole
night, at the judges' table.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.500
Who else at that disco
had it in for Benny?

15:53.583 --> 15:55.333
Benny was the king.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.291
People worshipped him.
Specially the women.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.375
The guy was a
real
Don Juan-Stein.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.542
He caught up in any
romantic triangles?

16:04.625 --> 16:07.500
Nah! No, he had
a serious girl.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.375
But you know them two
had a fight that day.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.667
'Now I know about this 'cause'

16:12.750 --> 16:14.750
I was doing something
you might think
unsavory

16:14.834 --> 16:18.750
but try to remember, I
was
just a horny kid at the
time.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.417
'Oh, yeah..'

16:25.500 --> 16:28.792
Do it for me, foxy fox.

16:31.709 --> 16:32.875
- This is the ladies room--
- Sonya.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.125
- Get the hell out!
- Don't cry.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.875
You're a
jerk
you know?

16:35.959 --> 16:37.959
I'm just having second
thoughts about eloping.

16:38.041 --> 16:39.375
It's putting too much
pressure on winning.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.709
I don't want it
to effect our dancing.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.917
You don't wanna elope 'cause

16:43.000 --> 16:44.458
<i>shiksa.</i>

16:44.542 --> 16:46.083
That ain't true.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.667
I thought you said
you'd
rather die than lie to
me?

16:47.750 --> 16:49.375
You know how my father is.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.458
'It's 1978, for God's sake.'

16:51.542 --> 16:55.041
- We can do what we want.
- I know, but he'd kill me.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.375
Well, waiting
is killing me.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.667
So you got
a choice to
make.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.959
It's either him or me.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.917
I should kill you, making
a slut out of me.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.166
You know, I was a virgin
before I met you!

17:18.166 --> 17:20.041
Oh, man, what an
idiot that guy
was.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.417
'Turning away a piece
of ass like that?'

17:22.500 --> 17:25.875
Believe me,
I wouldn't
have.

17:25.959 --> 17:28.000
I believe you, Paul.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.834
(Will)
'Mark Rigley?'

17:34.917 --> 17:36.750
- Who's askin'?
- 'Philly PD.'

17:36.834 --> 17:39.125
'Your parole officer said
we might find you here.'

17:39.208 --> 17:40.959
My crummy boss
telling lies again?

17:41.041 --> 17:42.583
What?

17:42.667 --> 17:44.667
This is about him in that
borrowed car incident, right?

17:44.750 --> 17:46.166
That was two months ago.

17:46.250 --> 17:50.125
- It was an emergency--
- No. It's not about that.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.625
Just walkin' the straight
and narrow here, man.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.250
Pushing a broom
for minimum wage.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.166
'Mark, in 1977 you were
shot at The Bell disco?'

17:58.250 --> 17:59.458
Yeah. So?

17:59.542 --> 18:01.792
Oh, we were kinda
hoping that, uh

18:01.875 --> 18:04.083
you kept that slug maybe
as a souvenir or something.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.125
We're trying to match it
to a bullet on another
case.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.917
You bet I know
where that slug
is.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.250
Right here.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.834
'For 27 years.'

18:14.917 --> 18:17.291
'Sets off metal
detectors like crazy.'

18:17.375 --> 18:19.000
The docs couldn't take it out?

18:19.083 --> 18:20.333
'Uh, not back then.'

18:20.417 --> 18:22.959
Maybe now, modern medicine.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.625
You'd be willing
to give it a go?

18:25.709 --> 18:27.417
I'm civic-minded.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.208
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to assist Philly's finest.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.709
'Course, uh.'

18:31.792 --> 18:33.291
Philly's finest
gotta assist me.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.500
Assist how?

18:34.583 --> 18:35.667
How much you think
it's worth going

18:35.750 --> 18:37.709
under the knife?

18:37.792 --> 18:39.000
A couple grand?

18:39.083 --> 18:41.750
That's mighty civic-minded
of you, Mark.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.417
Hey, capitalism made this
country great, my friend.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.834
That two grand?

18:46.917 --> 18:49.041
That ain't gonna happen.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.917
Then no deal.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.208
You guys wanna buy
my ass bullet.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.291
You know where I work.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.417
- 'You lied to us, Sonya.'
- Lied?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.709
You said you and Benny
were gettin' married

19:04.792 --> 19:06.208
but you broke up
with him that
night.

19:06.291 --> 19:09.250
In the ladies room.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.375
No.

19:11.458 --> 19:14.083
'I mean..'

19:14.166 --> 19:16.375
...we would have
worked it out.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.959
"I should kill you,
makin' a slut outta me."

19:19.041 --> 19:23.083
'Two hours later Benny ends
up with a bullet in his
head.'

19:23.166 --> 19:26.250
Benny was the love of my life.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.834
How do you know
what I said, anyway?

19:30.917 --> 19:33.000
Where were you when the
fire started, Sonya?

19:33.083 --> 19:34.125
On the floor.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.417
It was Doreen blabbin',
wasn't it?

19:36.500 --> 19:40.083
That nosy bitch knew
everything 'bout everything.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.125
Who's Doreen?

19:41.208 --> 19:43.542
Doreen Di Nova.

19:43.625 --> 19:46.417
Had a real thing for Benny.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.166
Always trying
to steal him from me.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.375
That right?

19:49.458 --> 19:52.750
She was competitive
with me over everything

19:52.834 --> 19:56.083
Benny, dancing,
you name it.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.792
'Was she in the dance
contest that night?'

19:57.875 --> 19:59.583
Yeah. Her, and
her partner Ken

19:59.667 --> 20:01.750
were our main
competition.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.250
She would have done
anything to win.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.333
(male #1)
'Last chance
for a practice dance.'

20:15.417 --> 20:17.208
'One hour till
starting time .'

20:17.291 --> 20:18.542
'You heard me, baby.'

20:18.625 --> 20:20.583
'One hour.'

20:25.250 --> 20:27.458
Oh, my heels.

20:27.542 --> 20:30.041
That's okay. I
got
another pair.

20:35.375 --> 20:36.959
Come on, Benny.
Dance with me.

20:37.041 --> 20:37.959
No. I got a partner.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.333
It's not too late
to switch.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.208
We won last year.
We could do it again this
year.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.625
I'm with
Sonya
now, Doreen.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.834
I'm better than her.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.333
That don't
matter.
I love Sonya.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.458
And I love Kenny.

20:46.542 --> 20:47.917
But you and me,
we could go places,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.792
win real competitions
in Manhattan and the like.

20:50.875 --> 20:51.792
Get it outta your head.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.166
It's not going to happen.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.625
Hey, Doreen.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.542
Got your
headlights
on, I see.

20:57.625 --> 20:58.834
Why you got to be
so selfish, Sonya?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.041
You already got
Benny in the sack.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.583
Why can't I have him
on the dance floor?

21:01.667 --> 21:02.792
Why should I?

21:02.875 --> 21:05.750
'Cause you can't keep up
with him and I can.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.500
- I ain't heard no
complaints.
- I ain't made any.

21:08.583 --> 21:09.709
Fine, be that way.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.583
You're not gonna be the
king forever, Benny.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.375
A lot could happen between
now and the contest.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.709
What is that
supposed to mean?

21:14.792 --> 21:17.125
It means I'm going home
wearing that tiara.

21:17.208 --> 21:20.083
- Problem, baby?
- No, there's no problem
here.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.750
Come on, hot stuff.
You're too foxy to fight.

21:22.834 --> 21:24.625
- Polack.
- Slut.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.959
'"A lot can happen between
now and the contest."'

21:29.041 --> 21:30.125
And that's a quote.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.625
You think it
was a threat?

21:31.709 --> 21:33.709
I just know
she was dying

21:33.792 --> 21:36.458
to be dancing queen
two years running.

21:42.834 --> 21:43.875
'Doreen Di Nova?'

21:43.959 --> 21:45.083
Yeah?

21:45.166 --> 21:48.208
We need to talk to
you
about Benny Rosen.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.875
Benny the Rose? Ooh!

21:50.959 --> 21:52.709
There's a blast
from the past.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.208
You remember
threatening
him?

21:54.291 --> 21:55.875
What?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.333
Uh, Gloria.

21:59.417 --> 22:01.208
Hang on a second.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.291
I need a smoke.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.667
You been talking to Sonya.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.917
Huh, right?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.417
What is she a fatty
now or what?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.083
Make good on
that threat, Doreen?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.333
''Cause Benny was
murdered that night.'

22:24.417 --> 22:27.417
Oh, yeah? Well,
that's news to
me.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.875
Where were you when
the fire started?

22:28.959 --> 22:33.083
On the floor,
with my partner
Ken.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.458
What, did Sonya tell
you I whacked Benny?

22:35.542 --> 22:36.667
You denying you made a threat?

22:36.750 --> 22:38.417
'I might have
said something'

22:38.500 --> 22:40.250
as a psych-out.

22:40.333 --> 22:43.166
- To win the contest?
- Yeah.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.834
A 1000 bucks was like
a million to us back then.

22:46.917 --> 22:49.667
And Ken needed
that money, bad.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.542
Why's that?

22:52.500 --> 22:54.417
This is ancient history, right?

22:54.500 --> 22:57.792
I can't get in trouble for
breakin' any narcotics laws?

22:57.875 --> 23:00.792
We're homicide.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.458
Well, back then

23:02.542 --> 23:04.959
coke was the drug of choice.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.250
Hey, Hoover, save
a bump for me.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.542
Don't worry,
baby,
I got more.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.500
Damn!

23:19.583 --> 23:21.250
You're out.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.125
You snorted it all?

23:24.208 --> 23:27.875
Crap!
I'm in trouble,
baby.

23:27.959 --> 23:29.792
- Real trouble.
- What do you mean?

23:29.875 --> 23:30.959
I was supposed to deal
that all that blow.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.458
I'm into Chaney for thousands.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.750
Well, you should have
thought of that before

23:33.834 --> 23:37.333
you snorted up
all his merchandise.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.250
I'm screwed.
Chaney's gonna kill me.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.959
You guys got the studio
upstairs reserved?

23:48.041 --> 23:49.834
That's right.

23:49.917 --> 23:51.000
Well, if you aren't
gonna use it I thought

23:51.083 --> 23:52.166
maybe I'd get in
some practicing.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.500
We're gonna use it.

23:59.291 --> 24:01.583
Doreen, that stuff throws off
your timing, makes you sloppy.

24:01.667 --> 24:04.667
If I were you, I'd be worried
about Sonya's two left hoofs

24:04.750 --> 24:06.417
'and not my timing.'

24:06.500 --> 24:09.000
You used to be
good, dedicated.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.834
How come you don't practice
no more like you used to?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.709
What do you
care, bagel
boy?

24:12.792 --> 24:15.417
We're still gonna wipe
the floor with you and
Sonya.

24:23.667 --> 24:24.792
I guess I should've

24:24.875 --> 24:28.083
realized Ken was
an addict but, uh

24:28.166 --> 24:29.375
at the time everybody
was snorting

24:29.458 --> 24:30.709
'like there was no tomorrow.'

24:30.792 --> 24:32.208
'You still in contact with Ken?'

24:32.291 --> 24:36.875
Nah. Fire busted us all apart.

24:36.959 --> 24:40.208
Burning of The Bell was the
day
disco died in South Philly.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.083
Was Ken an anti-semite
along with being an
addict?

24:43.166 --> 24:47.083
Instead of Benny the Rose, he
called him Benny the Nose, so.

24:47.166 --> 24:49.583
So, Ken could have done
something to Benny that
night.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.583
'Maybe to knock him
out of the contest'

24:51.667 --> 24:55.041
win that grand to
pay
off his coke debt?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.208
Though Sonya says you

24:57.291 --> 24:59.250
were the one who was
so desperate to win.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.750
Aah, well, that figures.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.250
I mean, me and the
Polish American Princess

25:03.333 --> 25:06.709
weren't exactly
soul sisters.

25:06.792 --> 25:10.041
But I wasn't a coke
fiend like Ken

25:10.125 --> 25:13.333
and I wasn't into Chaney
for thousands of dollars.

25:20.959 --> 25:22.417
'The bullet's still in him?'

25:22.500 --> 25:24.667
'Says it's a pain in
his ass, literally.'

25:24.750 --> 25:26.583
And, he'll only
cooperate for a price.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.542
- What price?
- Neighborhood of two grand.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.000
We don't live in
that neighborhood.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.291
Can't we compel him
to give us the bullet?

25:32.375 --> 25:34.583
- Get a search warrant?
- Check with the lawyers.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.250
Doreen's partner,
Ken Mazzacone, served a stint

25:37.333 --> 25:39.625
at Camp Hill in '82
for dealing coke.

25:39.709 --> 25:40.709
Went straight,
got a license

25:40.792 --> 25:42.875
with the city,
drives a cab now.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.125
Want to go see him?

25:44.208 --> 25:45.625
Where are you with
Doreen and Sonya?

25:45.709 --> 25:47.208
Both got motive,
both got alibis.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.667
They say they were on the dance
floor when the fire broke out.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.250
Witness statements
from '78 back that
up?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.500
Yeah, I'm on it.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.333
You two, see if you can
find this cab driver.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.208
Lil, go
visit
ADA Kite

25:57.291 --> 25:58.709
and find out about
that search warrant

25:58.792 --> 26:00.875
for Mr. Rigley's backside.

26:14.458 --> 26:15.667
Gotta take
the first hack in line.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.125
You're the
hack
we want, Ken.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.250
Do us a favor,
step
on out of there.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.917
You remember
"Benny the Nose" Ken?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.083
From The Bell?

26:29.166 --> 26:30.667
- Yeah, I remember Benny.
- Yeah.

26:30.750 --> 26:33.709
Turns out he was murdered
before the fire broke out.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.500
- That's a shame.
- Ain't it?

26:36.583 --> 26:37.834
What's it got
to do with me?

26:37.917 --> 26:39.500
We heard you
didn't like
him.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.166
That a crime?
He was uppity.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.667
'Cause he was a Jew?

26:42.750 --> 26:45.625
'Cause he was a drag.
A real goody two-shoes.

26:45.709 --> 26:48.667
Wouldn't deal coke
for Chaney, right?

26:48.750 --> 26:50.500
Relax, this
isn't drug
bust.

26:50.583 --> 26:53.875
Well, yeah. Chaney didn't like
a lot of people telling him no.

26:53.959 --> 26:55.291
He liked you, though.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.375
Hey, I ain't denying I
made a little extra cash

26:58.458 --> 27:00.041
selling merchandise
for Mr. Chaney.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.166
Except you used
more than you
sold.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.709
Ended up owing Chaney
a lot of money.

27:03.792 --> 27:06.875
Heard you had a real love
affair
going with the nose candy.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.375
Yeah, well, I'm off
of that particular

27:08.458 --> 27:10.458
diet plan now, as
you can see.

27:10.542 --> 27:11.709
Thousand bucks, though.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.291
Go a long way to
paying
off your debt.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.375
All you had to do was
eliminate the competition.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.792
I've eliminated nobody.
Didn't need to.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.208
I was just as good
a dancer as Benny was.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.709
We heard Benny
was the king.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.333
Then you heard wrong.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.542
Where were you when
the fire broke out, Ken?

27:26.709 --> 27:29.000
I was on the floor,
warming up with Doreen.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.375
Who's the rabbi?

27:54.458 --> 27:55.542
'That's Benny's dad.'

27:55.625 --> 27:57.041
- You sure?
- Yeah, Mr. Rosen.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.625
He comes into
the cleaners sometimes.

27:58.709 --> 28:01.083
- I'm gonna go say hello.
- Why?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.750
Because he's looking
for Benny

28:02.834 --> 28:05.166
and I'm going to point him
in the right direction.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.208
Mess with The Nose's head.

28:09.583 --> 28:13.166
Mr. Rosen, Doreen Di Nova
from the Fluff and Fold.

28:15.083 --> 28:17.750
- Have you seen my son?
- Sure.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.417
He's in the White Room. Come on.

28:20.834 --> 28:23.667
Know why they call it
the White Room, Mr. Rosen?

28:23.750 --> 28:25.583
'Cause that's where
they do all the blow.

28:26.709 --> 28:28.750
Cocaine.

28:28.834 --> 28:31.166
You better stop
talking, young
man.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.583
Or?

28:32.667 --> 28:35.000
You don't want
to know "or."

28:37.125 --> 28:38.333
Right in there.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.750
<i>shalomy</i>
to Benny for us.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.542
Man was pissed going
into that room.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.208
I wouldn't want to be
Benny at that moment.

28:49.291 --> 28:51.875
And you're positive
it was Benny's
father?

28:51.959 --> 28:53.792
Hey, who else would be
at The Bell hanging out

28:53.875 --> 28:55.500
with a Frisbee
on his head?

28:59.917 --> 29:01.625
- Not a chance.
- Don't say that, Kite.

29:01.709 --> 29:03.792
'No judge is gonna sign
a search warrant'

29:03.875 --> 29:06.291
for a guy's body
cavity
to remove a bullet.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.125
- Just won't happen.
- So that's it?

29:08.208 --> 29:10.000
- That's it. No sale.
- Out of luck.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.750
- Try again tomorrow.
- Just like the exhumation.

29:13.834 --> 29:16.000
You're still
smarting
about that?

29:16.083 --> 29:17.959
We're supposed to be
on the same team here.

29:18.041 --> 29:21.583
'We are. And my job
as your teammate'

29:21.667 --> 29:24.208
is to let you know
what's
legally plausible.

29:24.291 --> 29:25.709
This isn't.

29:25.792 --> 29:29.875
How about the city offering
some cash as incentive?

29:29.959 --> 29:32.500
What is-what is
this case anyway?

29:32.583 --> 29:34.333
'It's a..'

29:34.417 --> 29:36.500
...disco murder.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.333
- Disco?
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.417 --> 29:40.709
Okay, look it..

29:46.208 --> 29:47.875
- Stop that. Kite.
- We should go dancing.

29:47.959 --> 29:50.834
- We should go dancing.
- No, no.

29:50.917 --> 29:53.250
I'll take that
as a maybe, huh?

29:53.333 --> 29:54.333
Whoo!

29:55.667 --> 29:56.667
Kite, honestly..

29:56.750 --> 29:59.542
...this could be
a deal breaker.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.834
Eh, this, uh..

30:05.917 --> 30:07.834
...this guy, the, uh..

30:07.917 --> 30:09.792
...with the
slug
in his ass

30:09.875 --> 30:11.834
is he in any
trouble
with the law?

30:11.917 --> 30:14.417
Out on parole for a B and E.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.000
Let me talk to
his
parole officer.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.041
See if he'll go
for reduced
parole

30:18.125 --> 30:20.250
in exchange for
getting
that slug taken out.

30:20.333 --> 30:23.792
Do I have to do
anything in return?

30:23.875 --> 30:26.041
Dance.

30:28.041 --> 30:29.375
'Why didn't you tell us'

30:29.458 --> 30:33.542
'you were at the disco
that night, Mr. Rosen?'

30:33.625 --> 30:36.875
I didn't see
how it mattered.

30:36.959 --> 30:40.291
'Your wife know you went
to see Benny that night?'

30:40.375 --> 30:44.583
In orthodox temples,
men and women sit apart.

30:44.667 --> 30:48.041
I was gone, and back before
the service was over.

30:48.125 --> 30:50.750
'She didn't know.'

30:50.834 --> 30:52.583
What did you say to your son?

30:52.667 --> 30:53.583
That's private.

30:53.667 --> 30:55.250
'Not good enough, Mr. Rosen.'

30:55.333 --> 30:56.750
Don't you want to know
who killed your boy?

30:56.834 --> 30:58.000
The 22 other people?

30:58.083 --> 30:59.417
Unless you already know.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.959
We know you got a temper.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.667
And how betrayed
you felt by Benny.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.375
You think I killed my own son?

31:05.458 --> 31:07.333
You had
opportunity,
and motive.

31:07.417 --> 31:10.291
You disapproved of him.
You said so yourself.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.417
For good reason.

31:18.959 --> 31:20.166
'Dad.'

31:20.250 --> 31:22.208
What are you doing here?

31:26.125 --> 31:28.166
How can you pray
in this cesspool?

31:28.250 --> 31:29.959
What's it matter
where I pray, huh?

31:30.041 --> 31:31.125
As long as I pray?

31:31.208 --> 31:32.417
And what are
you praying
for?

31:32.500 --> 31:35.375
To win a
ridiculous
dance contest?

31:35.458 --> 31:37.792
Or to get your
hands
on more blow?

31:37.875 --> 31:39.792
I don't do that, Dad.

31:39.875 --> 31:41.000
Come to temple with me.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.000
It's Friday
night.
<i>Sabbath.</i>

31:43.083 --> 31:45.291
I'm not going to temple.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.208
I'm not going to dental
school either, Dad.

31:51.959 --> 31:54.500
You choose this degradation
over your heritage?

31:54.583 --> 31:56.750
This is my heritage now, Dad.

31:56.834 --> 31:59.041
- Disco.
- Disco's a fad.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.959
Your family, the temple
that's your life.

32:02.041 --> 32:04.166
Disco's my life, Dad.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.500
Alright? It's not a fad.

32:07.583 --> 32:10.417
It's here to stay.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.208
And so am I.

32:13.291 --> 32:14.667
In fact..

32:14.750 --> 32:17.834
I'm gonna marry
my dance partner

32:17.917 --> 32:19.500
the girl I love.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.333
<i>shiksa.</i>

32:28.792 --> 32:32.834
You do, and you'll never step
foot in my house again.

32:38.709 --> 32:41.125
Fine.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.208
Fine.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.333
Then you're no longer my son.

32:53.875 --> 32:55.750
I renounce you.

32:58.333 --> 33:01.542
It's why I didn't tell you.

33:01.625 --> 33:05.083
Why I never told my wife.

33:05.166 --> 33:08.875
Those were the last words
I ever spoke to my son.

33:11.083 --> 33:14.166
"I...renounce...you."

33:18.041 --> 33:21.083
Where'd you go after you left
the White Room, Mr. Rosen?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.750
I went back
to the
temple.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.625
And while I was praying

33:25.709 --> 33:29.166
my son was murdered

33:29.250 --> 33:31.000
burned to death.

33:43.542 --> 33:46.709
Kite did us a solid, swinging
that deal with Rigley.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.166
Rigley went for
it
pretty quick

33:48.250 --> 33:50.583
when he found out he
could miss a day of
work.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.792
Sweeping up cigarette butts
in 20-degree weather

33:52.875 --> 33:54.542
or taking an easy
outpatient procedure.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.333
I can see taking
curtain number two.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.625
Slug's in pretty good
condition, considering.

33:58.709 --> 34:01.375
Is it a match
to Benny's bullet?

34:01.458 --> 34:03.250
Congratulations,
Detectives.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.667
You have twins.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.208
Nice.

34:08.291 --> 34:10.792
16 witness statements say Chaney
was at the judges' table

34:10.875 --> 34:12.333
all the way up
until the fire.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.000
His gun, but he
didn't use it.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.000
What about our two dancing
queens, Sonya and Doreen

34:16.083 --> 34:17.959
and the cabbie, Ken Mazzacone?

34:18.041 --> 34:20.750
Alibi's held up. People saw
them all on the dance floor.

34:20.834 --> 34:22.583
And we verified David
Rosen was back in temple

34:22.667 --> 34:24.458
before the fire broke out.

34:24.542 --> 34:26.125
Who are we overlooking?

34:26.208 --> 34:27.959
'Witnesses put Chaney
at the judges' table'

34:28.041 --> 34:29.709
but what about
his son, Paul?

34:29.792 --> 34:31.375
No statements about
his whereabouts.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.542
'Just his own, right? Said he
was with his father all
night.'

34:33.625 --> 34:35.625
A father who's
conveniently dead.

34:35.709 --> 34:38.125
Little weasel like him, he'd
know where his dad kept his
gun.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.625
And he'd have access
to the White Room.

34:39.709 --> 34:42.500
Now, we've only
one problem, motive?

34:42.583 --> 34:44.792
Why would Paul want
to kill Benny Rosen?

34:44.875 --> 34:48.667
'Paul Chaney was
a little perv.'

34:48.750 --> 34:51.000
He have any beef
with Benny?

34:51.083 --> 34:53.333
Paul kind idolized Benny.

34:53.417 --> 34:55.166
Wanted to dance like him.

34:56.583 --> 34:57.917
He any good?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.333
Total klutz.

34:59.417 --> 35:02.917
He was always showing off
for Benny, "Watch me"

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
like an annoying
kid brother, you know?

35:05.083 --> 35:07.333
He show off for Benny
the night of the fire?

35:09.500 --> 35:12.667
Earlier that day he did.

35:12.750 --> 35:14.667
We were rehearsing a number.

35:36.625 --> 35:37.625
Hey, Benny

35:37.709 --> 35:39.542
'can I cut in?'

35:39.625 --> 35:41.542
We're kind of working
on a move here, Paul.

35:41.625 --> 35:44.500
'I know, the Argentinean Tango.'

35:44.583 --> 35:46.333
I can do it.

35:46.417 --> 35:47.542
Watch me.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.041
- That's not bad.
- Really?

35:55.125 --> 35:56.834
'You think I could dancer
one day like you, Benny?'

35:56.917 --> 35:59.583
Yeah, Paul. Just
you keep
practicing.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.667
I will, 'cause, one day

36:01.750 --> 36:03.792
I'm gonna be
the king like you.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.458
'Hey, Doreen.'

36:07.542 --> 36:10.166
Benny says I'm
a good dancer.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.542
Don't let it go to your head.

36:11.625 --> 36:13.709
He thinks Sonya's good, too.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.125
Dance with me, Doreen.

36:24.291 --> 36:26.083
Yeah, alright.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.166
Come with me.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.750
Why would a disco queen like

36:57.834 --> 37:00.250
Doreen let Paul feel her up?

37:00.333 --> 37:01.959
Owner's son, maybe.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.834
Where was Doreen
taking the kid?

37:03.917 --> 37:05.583
Toward the White Room.

37:08.208 --> 37:11.291
Me and that little twerp?

37:11.375 --> 37:12.834
What, are you nuts?

37:12.917 --> 37:15.792
According to Sonya, you guys
were all over each other.

37:15.875 --> 37:18.375
He was all over
me,
more like it.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.333
Why'd you let Paul
grope you like that?

37:20.417 --> 37:22.458
I felt sorry for him.

37:22.542 --> 37:25.166
You take him back
to the White Room?

37:25.250 --> 37:28.166
We talked to your old
dancing partner Ken.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.041
Oh, yeah?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.375
How's he?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.792
Fat.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.500
Ken says he can't remember
you being

37:34.583 --> 37:37.291
on the dance floor with him
before the fire started.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.333
I don't believe this.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.709
You're trying to pin
Benny's murder on me?

37:46.792 --> 37:47.917
You got motive.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.291
And without an alibi,
you got opportunity.

37:50.375 --> 37:51.750
Unless you give us
good reason not to.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.291
'We're going to have
to arrest you.'

37:53.375 --> 37:54.834
The hell you are.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.083
I didn't kill Benny.

37:58.709 --> 37:59.667
Then who did?

37:59.750 --> 38:02.208
I don't know.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.375
I swear.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.625
I just wanted to win.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.750
Here's the deal,
you little horn dog.

38:15.834 --> 38:17.667
I'm listening.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.250
So, Benny always comes in here
right before dancing, right?

38:20.333 --> 38:21.417
Right.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.083
While he's doing
whatever he does

38:23.166 --> 38:25.125
you sneak in wearing
a ski mask

38:25.208 --> 38:27.709
whack him one
on the knee.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.875
Use a baseball
bat, a tire iron

38:29.959 --> 38:31.125
anything that'll
do the job.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.250
And you'll let me
make it with you?

38:35.959 --> 38:37.166
You knock Benny
out of the contest

38:37.250 --> 38:39.333
I'll let you do
whatever you want.

38:42.125 --> 38:45.166
The only thing the little
twerp was supposed to do

38:45.250 --> 38:47.250
was wallop Benny on the leg

38:48.333 --> 38:49.709
'put him out
of commission.'

38:49.792 --> 38:51.291
But instead he killed him.

38:51.375 --> 38:53.041
Then torched the place.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.291
I don't know what
Paul did or didn't do.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.291
I was on the dance floor

38:58.375 --> 39:00.417
'like I told you.'

39:00.500 --> 39:03.709
Oh, God.

39:03.792 --> 39:06.583
I didn't want any permanent
harm to come to Benny.

39:08.458 --> 39:11.250
But the thought of that
talentless bitch Sonya

39:11.333 --> 39:13.250
winning the contest,
and wearing the tiara.

39:13.333 --> 39:17.041
I couldn't let that happen.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.000
You gotta understand.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.041
I was better than her.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.166
Way better.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.959
Twenty three counts of murder
in the first degree, Paul.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.125
I want a lawyer.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.500
I don't blame you.

39:30.583 --> 39:32.125
Won't make a difference.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.709
We got physical evidence.

39:34.792 --> 39:37.125
That's the slug from
Benny Rosen's skull.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.041
Here's a slug from
your dad's gun

39:39.125 --> 39:40.667
one you threw
in the Delaware.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.333
'Maybe you forgot'

39:42.417 --> 39:43.959
you shot a Burglar
back in '77.

39:44.041 --> 39:46.125
They're a perfect match, Paul.

39:50.291 --> 39:51.542
- So?
- So.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.500
We know the bullet
that killed Benny

39:53.583 --> 39:55.041
came from your
dad's gun.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.500
Which you had access to.

39:56.583 --> 40:00.625
Plus Doreen told us
about your little deal.

40:00.709 --> 40:04.250
'Knock Benny out of the
contest,
get some action in return'

40:04.333 --> 40:05.667
Except you knocked
him out permanently.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.792
'How do you live
with yourself, Paul?'

40:07.875 --> 40:09.875
Knowing you killed
the disco king you worshipped

40:09.959 --> 40:11.500
not to mention
22 other people?

40:11.583 --> 40:14.583
Twenty three if you count your
dad who drank himself to death.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.375
I didn't kill those people.

40:22.458 --> 40:23.875
Forensics says you did.

40:23.959 --> 40:25.583
So does Doreen.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.250
It wasn't my fault.

40:28.333 --> 40:29.875
Whose was it?

40:32.166 --> 40:34.083
It was..

40:34.166 --> 40:36.208
It was Benny's fault.

41:29.417 --> 41:30.625
Paul, what the hell?

41:30.709 --> 41:33.709
Benny, I can explain.

41:33.792 --> 41:34.750
Get off of
me,
you little
twerp

41:34.834 --> 41:36.709
before I kick your ass.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.750
What are you calling
me that for, Benny?

41:44.834 --> 41:46.667
All I ever wanted
to do was be like you.

41:46.750 --> 41:48.750
You, like me?

41:48.834 --> 41:50.959
You're the worst
disco dancer in Philly.

41:57.792 --> 41:59.083
'You think you're
such hot stuff'

41:59.166 --> 42:01.917
hogging up all the
foxes for yourself.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.458
Well, you aren't such
hot stuff now, are
you?
