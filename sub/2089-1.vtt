Yes, he is. The major
wants to talk to you.

01:12:31.675 --> 01:12:33.209
Major? Hope I'm not in trouble.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.877
I hope not either.

01:12:34.878 --> 01:12:36.979
Yeah, Major?

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.232
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
You knocked it

01:12:39.233 --> 01:12:41.484
out of the park. Thank
you for saving Karly.

01:12:41.485 --> 01:12:46.189
Well, thank you very much, sir.
I told you I'm a professional.

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:49.492
That you are, son. That you are.

01:12:49.493 --> 01:12:53.196
Yeah, well, any time you have any
trouble, you know who to call,

01:12:53.197 --> 01:12:56.232
except it's not going to be cheap.
I've got a partner now.

01:12:56.233 --> 01:12:58.534
[JOSE CHUCKLES]

01:12:58.535 --> 01:13:00.420
And there's a little
business about my, uh...

01:13:00.421 --> 01:13:02.305
my truck. I made some
modifications to it.

01:13:02.306 --> 01:13:04.240
Alex.

01:13:04.241 --> 01:13:07.377
And I'm not sure that the insurance
at the company's going to cover it.

01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:09.077
Alex.

01:13:16.786 --> 01:13:18.788
Major, I'm going to
have to call you back.

01:13:18.789 --> 01:13:21.290
Alex, can we get out of here?

01:13:21.291 --> 01:13:25.093
I'm sorry, Jose. I live to kill.

01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:27.028
Okay.

01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:30.532
I got your back, babe.

01:13:31.234 --> 01:13:32.235
Hey, Jose.

01:13:32.236 --> 01:13:34.003
What?

01:13:34.004 --> 01:13:36.606
You remember that conversation
we had in the... in the truck?

01:13:36.607 --> 01:13:37.707
Which one?

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:39.075
The one about the spinneret.

01:13:39.076 --> 01:13:41.711
We're going to shoot
it in the butt.

01:13:41.712 --> 01:13:42.945
Find me that bazooka!

01:13:42.946 --> 01:13:45.514
You got it, Alex.

01:13:51.454 --> 01:13:54.456
You want some of the Ex?

01:14:01.097 --> 01:14:03.698
Alex! I'm coming.

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:13.543
Throw it to me.

01:14:13.544 --> 01:14:16.611
Watch out, Alex! Wake up, Alex!

01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:32.127
Up yours.

01:14:53.015 --> 01:14:55.116
[MEN CHEERING]

01:14:58.321 --> 01:15:00.622
Yeah!

01:15:14.437 --> 01:15:16.172
Nicely done.

01:15:16.173 --> 01:15:20.409
I told you I'm a pro. I'm a pro.
Oh, look at you, you're gross.

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:21.511
Oh.

01:15:21.512 --> 01:15:23.412
You've got web all over you.

01:15:23.413 --> 01:15:25.081
You're one to talk.

01:15:25.082 --> 01:15:27.316
Well, it looks like we're
stuck together for a while.

01:15:27.317 --> 01:15:28.718
Is that a problem?

01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:30.353
No, I don't have a
problem with that.

01:15:30.354 --> 01:15:33.422
Well, what should you do with
the rest of your day off?

01:15:33.423 --> 01:15:36.091
I can think of a few things.

01:15:43.332 --> 01:15:45.468
All right, you guys.

01:15:45.469 --> 01:15:46.969
[CHUCKLES]

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:50.739
Okay. Hey, come on, guys.
Get a room. Okay?

01:16:11.794 --> 01:16:15.794
Alex, I'm afraid we
have a little problem.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:19.819
What's the biggest
cockroach you ever saw?

01:16:20.305 --> 01:16:26.901
