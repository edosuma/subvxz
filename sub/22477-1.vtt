00:29.040 --> 00:31.880
The oceans seemingly limitless,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.320
invoke in us a sense of awe and wonder
and also sometimes fear.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.320
They cover 70% of the surface
of our planet,

00:41.680 --> 00:45.120
and yet they are still
the least explored.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.640
Hidden beneath the waves
right beneath my feet,

00:51.080 --> 00:54.160
there are creatures
beyond our imagination.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.320
With revolutionary technology,
we can enter new worlds...

01:19.520 --> 01:21.200
and shine the light on behaviours

01:21.280 --> 01:24.440
in ways that were impossible
just a generation ago.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.080
We've also recognized
an uncomfortable fact.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.000
The health of our ocean is under threat.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.080
They're changing at a faster rate
than ever before in human history.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.480
Never has there been a more crucial time

01:47.560 --> 01:52.000
to reveal what is going on
beneath the surface of the seas.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.000
In this first episode,

02:10.840 --> 02:15.960
we will journey across the globe
from the warm waters of the tropics

02:19.000 --> 02:21.800
to the coldest around the poles.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.760
To bring us a new understanding
of live beneath the waves.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.720
This is Blue Planet II.

03:38.680 --> 03:43.800
The surface of the ocean conceals
the many creatures that live beneath

03:55.760 --> 03:58.560
but not all.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.040
Bottlenose dolphins.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.840
They're extremely intelligent.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.760
And with this intelligence
comes playfulness.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.040
They surf.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.680
And as far as we can tell,
they do so for the sheer joy of it.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.480
But to properly appreciate
their true character,

05:09.640 --> 05:14.040
you have to travel with them
into their world.

05:27.240 --> 05:32.360
A pod of bottlenose dolphins is visiting
a coral reef in the Red Sea.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.240
For the youngsters,
there are things to be learned here.

05:47.440 --> 05:52.200
The adults lead a calf
to a particular bushlike coral

05:52.600 --> 05:54.960
called a Gorgonian.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.040
And here, the adults behave
rather strangely.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.720
They deliberately rub themselves
through the fronds.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.640
Their calf seems reluctant to do so.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.680
By watching his elders,

06:51.760 --> 06:55.760
he may be realizing
that this is something he ought to do.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.240
Gorgonia fronds, in fact,
are covered with a mucous

07:06.360 --> 07:10.960
that can have antiinflammatory
and antimicrobial properties.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.520
So maybe the adult dolphins
are doing this

07:18.600 --> 07:20.720
to protect themselves from infection.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.640
The dolphins' intimate knowledge
of the reef

07:35.720 --> 07:40.120
is spurring us to search
for new medicines here, too.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.000
Tropical coral reefs

07:51.080 --> 07:55.200
occupy only a tenth of one percent
of the ocean floor.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.240
But their shallow warm waters
and stable year round conditions,

08:02.360 --> 08:05.920
support some of the most crowded
and varied communities

08:06.040 --> 08:08.600
to be found anywhere in the oceans.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.640
And there are new discoveries to be made
on every one of them.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.799
One creature
on Australia's Great Barrier Reef

08:39.919 --> 08:44.280
is challenging our understanding
of fish intelligence.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.320
A tusk fish.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.320
And you can see why it gets its name.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.600
He does something
few would have believed a fish could do.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.160
Every morning,
he travels to the edge of the reef.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.200
He's searching
for something special to eat

09:26.280 --> 09:28.760
amongst the coral and sand.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.240
Here's one.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.840
A small clam.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.600
But how to crack it open
and get to the meat?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.920
He takes it all the way back

10:09.880 --> 10:11.600
to his special kitchen.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.120
A bowlshaped coral

10:22.560 --> 10:27.240
that has a particular bump on the inside
that he always uses.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.040
It's not easy if you have no hands.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.320
Whoops.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.840
There he goes again.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.600
But he's got great determination

11:12.880 --> 11:14.960
and surprising accuracy.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.800
At last.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.880
So here is a fish that uses tools.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.240
Some fish are much cleverer
than you might suppose.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.200
The density of the animals
on tropical reefs

12:08.320 --> 12:11.840
makes competition
inevitable and extreme.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.040
Not only for those that lived
within the reef,

12:17.320 --> 12:19.800
but for the birds that fly above them.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.880
During the dry season,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.360
over half a million terns

12:27.480 --> 12:30.960
crowd onto this remote atoll
in the Indian Ocean.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.360
Their chicks are still
in their dark, juvenile plumage.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.760
They vary in age.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.440
Whilst the more advanced chicks
take to the air,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.080
others aren't quite ready yet.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.200
Those just starting to learn to fly

13:33.280 --> 13:37.080
use the shallow lagoon
that occupies the centre of the atoll

13:37.160 --> 13:38.880
as their training ground.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.120
It's difficult for some of them
to stay aloft for long.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.680
Giant trevallies.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.720
Usually, they're solitary hunters,

14:26.920 --> 14:30.920
but about 50 of them have come here
from neighbouring reefs

14:31.040 --> 14:34.520
attracted by this abundance
of potential prey.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.600
The fledglings stay out of the water
if they can,

14:47.560 --> 14:49.560
they even drink on the wing.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.760
If the trevally are to catch one now,

15:10.760 --> 15:12.680
they have to up their game.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.600
So there is a fish here that amazingly

15:25.680 --> 15:29.760
has a brain capable of calculating
the airspeed,

15:29.840 --> 15:33.040
altitude and trajectory of a bird.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.320
The time comes when every fledgling
has to take to the air

16:08.440 --> 16:10.480
and collect food for itself.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.760
Their parents lead them
to the training grounds.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.240
If they're to survive,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.480
they must learn quickly.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.120
After a month of practising
over the lagoon,

18:28.240 --> 18:30.080
the youngsters start to leave

18:30.160 --> 18:33.200
and take their chances
out over the open sea.

18:40.520 --> 18:46.040
The oceans hold 97% of all the water
in the world.

18:48.680 --> 18:52.320
As the sun warms their surface,
water evaporates.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.360
The vapour rises into the sky

18:55.440 --> 18:59.280
until it cools and condenses
into towering clouds.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.360
And they generate huge storms.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.520
The spin of the earth
deflects these storms

19:12.600 --> 19:15.800
north and south into cooler latitudes.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.360
As they travel across the sea,

19:26.560 --> 19:30.600
stormdriven winds create huge swells.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.160
When the swells reach shallower waters,

19:45.480 --> 19:48.920
they rise into gigantic waves.

20:06.320 --> 20:10.640
In its lifetime,
a large storm can release energy

20:10.720 --> 20:14.800
that is the equivalent
of 10,000 nuclear bombs.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.400
These are the seasonal seas.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.200
And when they warm in spring,

20:47.440 --> 20:50.280
they can suddenly explode with life.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.240
Mobula rays have gathered
in Mexico's Sea of Cortez

21:09.360 --> 21:11.040
in vast numbers.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.800
Why do they leap?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.880
Is it to tell others that they're here?

21:28.360 --> 21:29.840
No one knows.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.720
They feed mostly at night

21:35.840 --> 21:40.840
for that is when vast swarms
of plankton rise from the depths.

21:46.920 --> 21:51.440
The disturbance in the water stimulates
many of the planktonic creatures

21:51.520 --> 21:53.120
to luminesce.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.600
Only now do we have the technology
to record their faint glow.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.080
The feasting rays swim through them

22:11.160 --> 22:15.600
creating an extraordinary ballet
of life and death.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.240
The richness of these waters
is based on microscopic plants,

23:08.600 --> 23:10.000
phytoplankton,

23:10.320 --> 23:14.600
which bloom on such a massive scale
they benefit us all.

23:17.920 --> 23:21.360
They, together with seaweeds
and seagrasses,

23:21.520 --> 23:23.280
produce as much oxygen

23:23.360 --> 23:27.240
as all the forests
and grassy plains on land.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.840
Every spring off New Zealand,

23:40.920 --> 23:44.640
the seasonal bounty
draws in rare visitors.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.080
False killer whales.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.600
They're relatives of the orca,

24:00.720 --> 24:03.880
six metres long
and weighing over a tonne.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.000
They appear to be searching
for dolphins.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.240
And there are many
in these coastal waters.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.480
Here, bottlenose dolphins stick together

24:34.560 --> 24:37.720
constantly chattering
with whistles and clicks.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.560
Such a din carries for miles underwater.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.200
The false killers have detected them.

25:22.360 --> 25:26.080
Travelling at ten knots,
the killers quickly close in on them.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.840
But then,
something truly extraordinary happens.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.440
The dolphins turn

25:56.600 --> 25:59.440
as if to greet their pursuers.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.800
They seem to change their course.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.080
Could it be that they're attempting
to communicate?

26:24.600 --> 26:27.560
Scientists studying
this annual encounter,

26:27.680 --> 26:31.520
now think that individuals
may recognize one another.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.920
Almost unbelievably,
it seems that these different species

26:39.000 --> 26:41.040
appear to be old friends.

26:48.520 --> 26:52.000
Together they're gathering
as one unified army

26:52.080 --> 26:54.040
up to a thousand strong.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.040
This formidable hunting party
now harvests the riches

27:06.280 --> 27:08.400
that come with New Zealand's summer.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.560
All across the higher latitudes,

27:33.800 --> 27:37.520
seasonal seas flourish
under the summer sun.

27:40.640 --> 27:44.120
Here in Alaska,
sea otters lounge in the canopy

27:44.200 --> 27:46.600
of great submarine forests.

27:53.680 --> 28:00.640
Giant kelp, the biggest seaweed of all
is home to all kinds of life.

28:02.040 --> 28:06.480
On the forest floor, spiny
sea urchins munch through the kelp.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.520
Elsewhere there are continuously hungry
sea cucumbers.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.120
And in the tangled undergrowth,

28:18.240 --> 28:21.640
wonderfully camouflaged sea dragons.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.640
In the underwater forests
of northern Japan,

28:36.760 --> 28:38.760
the residents of this sunken wreck

28:38.840 --> 28:43.880
are waiting for the summer temperatures
to reach 16 degrees Celsius.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.600
That for some is the time for mating.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.360
A kind of giant wrasse called a Kobudai.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.080
This is a male.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.720
And in female terms,
he's particularly handsome.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.880
He's a metre long and weighs 15 kilos.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.880
Much larger than the diminutive female,

29:55.800 --> 29:58.160
and he is ready to breed.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.920
He attempts to mate with her

30:04.280 --> 30:08.640
and with any of the dozen or so females
that live in his territory,

30:10.280 --> 30:12.120
whenever he gets the chance.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.720
But females from around ten years old

30:29.880 --> 30:32.840
take little notice of his advances.

31:00.320 --> 31:05.000
This is because when any large female
reaches a critical body size,

31:05.520 --> 31:08.920
she can begin a dramatic transformation.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.200
Over just a few months,

31:28.320 --> 31:32.560
particular enzymes inside her body
cease to work,

31:34.560 --> 31:38.200
and male hormones start to circulate.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.800
As time passes,

31:45.080 --> 31:46.720
her head expands

31:47.400 --> 31:49.320
and her chin gets longer.

31:52.360 --> 31:56.280
A she has changed into a he.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.640
And with this comes a change
in temperament.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.320
The old male who rules
all the females here

32:20.520 --> 32:22.960
is challenged to a face off.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.240
The more bulbous the head,

32:31.760 --> 32:34.840
the more it intimidates an opponent.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.160
The territory has a new ruler.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.760
Only the largest females transform
themselves in this way.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.760
But the change enables them
to have more mates,

33:30.080 --> 33:34.040
so they will have many more offspring
carrying their genes.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.640
But a new male can't afford
to be complacent.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.680
Inside the body of every Kobudai female,

33:49.560 --> 33:52.320
there is a new male in waiting.

34:11.840 --> 34:16.719
The closer we travel towards the poles,
the colder the seas become.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.840
Icebergs appear.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.639
Huge slabs that have broken away

34:24.719 --> 34:26.760
from glaciers that are sliding
into the sea.

34:28.560 --> 34:32.120
And then the surface starts to freeze.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.480
While the lights of the aurora
play above,

34:45.719 --> 34:47.560
even in the depths of midwinter,

34:48.159 --> 34:51.679
there are a few places
well north of the Arctic circle

34:51.800 --> 34:53.239
that are still open.

35:04.360 --> 35:08.040
The fjords of northern Norway
remain ice free

35:08.120 --> 35:11.000
because a giant current,
the Gulf Stream,

35:11.080 --> 35:12.960
flows up here from the south

35:13.040 --> 35:16.160
bringing warmth all the way
from the Caribbean.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.520
And every winter,

35:21.600 --> 35:24.960
billions of herring
come here for shelter.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.600
And following them...

35:33.160 --> 35:34.360
Orca.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.680
There are up to a thousand of them.

35:50.480 --> 35:54.680
It's possibly the greatest gathering
of orca on the planet.

36:04.520 --> 36:08.680
The herring maybe plentiful
but in these winding fjords

36:08.760 --> 36:11.520
they're not always easy to track down.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.200
These particular orca, however,

36:18.600 --> 36:21.000
are fish hunting specialists.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.320
They work as a team,

36:31.440 --> 36:35.920
coordinating their approach
by calling loudly to one another.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.640
They herd the herring
into tighter and tighter shoals.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.160
They swim below them,

37:01.240 --> 37:03.720
trapping them against
the surface of the sea.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.320
And now the orca deploy
their special weapon.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.560
They beat their tails with such force,

37:24.680 --> 37:27.480
that the shock waves stun the herring.

37:30.160 --> 37:34.240
And then the senseless victims
are easily collected.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.080
But all this underwater noise
attracts others.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.640
Humpback whales.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.680
They move in on the action.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.960
They approach the shoal from beneath
and then lunge upwards,

38:44.320 --> 38:48.680
gathering up to a hundred kilos
of herring in a single mouthful.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.360
The humpbacks are comparative newcomers.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.640
They only started coming here
within the last decade.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.600
But these polars seas are so rich

39:28.720 --> 39:31.520
that there appears to be enough food
for everyone.

39:53.760 --> 39:57.000
Nonetheless, few if any of these riches

39:57.120 --> 40:00.560
would be here were it not
for the Gulf Stream.

40:09.640 --> 40:14.280
Ocean currents, in fact, are crucial
to the well being of our planet.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.400
They distribute the sun's heat
towards the poles

40:22.480 --> 40:24.080
all the way from the equator,

40:26.640 --> 40:31.000
maintaining a climate favourable
for life almost everywhere.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.720
From creating the weather
to producing oxygen,

40:40.800 --> 40:43.600
the seas keep our world healthy.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.200
But there are now worrying signs

40:55.320 --> 40:56.880
that conditions in the oceans

40:56.960 --> 40:59.760
that have remained relatively stable
for millennia

41:00.160 --> 41:01.960
are changing radically.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.360
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Arctic.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.560
Here in the past 30 years,

41:11.680 --> 41:16.280
the extent of the ice in summer
has been reduced by 40%.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.120
This sudden warming,

41:19.280 --> 41:22.080
most likely a consequence
of human activity,

41:22.440 --> 41:26.160
is having a profound impact
on its wildlife.

41:33.080 --> 41:37.000
Walruses are among those
that are seriously affected.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.280
Every adult female
needs to find a safe place

41:50.680 --> 41:53.360
where her 80kilo pup can rest.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.840
The sea ice is retreating

41:57.920 --> 42:00.560
from much
of the walrus' traditional range,

42:00.760 --> 42:03.920
so they now have
to haul out on dry land.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.680
But a herd of hundreds
of quarrelsome mothers,

42:12.760 --> 42:16.800
some weighing almost a tonne,
is not an ideal nursery.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.760
Walruses on land stick together
for good reason.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.280
Polar bears.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.000
A full grown male walrus is gigantic,

42:41.080 --> 42:43.840
too big for even a polar bear to tackle.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.200
So the bear is looking
for a walrus baby.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.560
The scent of the bear
spreads alarm through the colony.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.320
The walruses retreat into the sea.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.840
The bear knows it won't be able
to catch them there.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.480
But she too has young ones to feed.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.680
What is a mother to do?

44:02.720 --> 44:05.560
A mother walrus still needs
to find a place

44:05.680 --> 44:07.280
where her young can rest.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.200
A melting iceberg might do,

44:18.520 --> 44:21.640
but she is not the first
to find this one.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.040
Suitable places are already taken.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.960
Other mothers don't want to share.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.240
They, too, need a patch of ice
where they can protect their young.

45:22.480 --> 45:27.160
A desperate mother has no choice
but to barge her way in.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.200
So this time everyone loses.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.480
Finding the right place
on these melting shores

46:21.720 --> 46:24.480
gets harder and harder.

46:59.080 --> 47:04.840
Solving these problems together
helps create a bond so strong

47:04.920 --> 47:09.600
that the mother will stay in contact
with her young for the rest of her life.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.800
But who knows now
what their future will be.

47:38.600 --> 47:41.920
As we understand more
about the complexity

47:42.080 --> 47:44.400
of the lives of sea creatures,

47:45.720 --> 47:49.840
so we begin to appreciate
the fragility of their home.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.360
Our blue planet.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.760
Blue Planet II has been
four years in the making.

48:35.560 --> 48:38.120
The teams have explored every ocean,

48:38.240 --> 48:41.120
seeking extraordinary untold stories,

48:41.200 --> 48:42.880
many new to science.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.760
Bringing a new understanding
of life beneath the waves.

49:04.400 --> 49:08.680
The latest diving technology
producing no bubbles or noise

49:08.800 --> 49:12.560
has allowed our teams
longer and closer encounters.

49:19.400 --> 49:22.760
To explore our final frontier,
the deep,

49:22.840 --> 49:26.240
we have spent a thousand hours
in submersibles

49:26.360 --> 49:29.040
over half a mile below the surface.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.400
Innovative new camera technology

49:35.480 --> 49:39.160
makes it possible to film moments
never seen before.

49:41.480 --> 49:46.920
Lowlight cameras capture magical events
almost invisible to the naked eye.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.200
Probe cameras
give a completely fresh perspective

50:01.280 --> 50:03.760
into the lives of tiny creatures.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.040
Here he comes, here he comes.

50:06.160 --> 50:11.280
While suction cameras take us
on a giant's eye view of the ocean.

50:18.280 --> 50:22.520
But the sea is an unpredictable
and dangerous place to work.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.640
Nowhere more so than the so called
wild coast of South Africa.

50:34.920 --> 50:37.320
Home to surfing dolphins.

50:42.920 --> 50:47.280
The team's mission here
is to ride alongside the dolphins

50:47.360 --> 50:51.880
and record their surfing behaviour
in closer detail than ever before.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.440
These are treacherous seas,

50:57.560 --> 51:01.960
so the film crew enlists local
professional surfers to guide them.

51:10.680 --> 51:15.160
But this year, the waves are bigger
than anyone had anticipated.

51:16.960 --> 51:21.080
A daunting prospect for surf cameraman,
Chris Bryan.

51:22.600 --> 51:25.440
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty nervous,
the...

51:25.640 --> 51:27.160
It's a big swell out there.

51:27.640 --> 51:30.960
Really big swell.
Like there's 20foot waves out there,

51:31.040 --> 51:35.600
and, um, yeah this will probably be
the biggest seas I've ever been out in.

51:36.280 --> 51:38.560
No risks, no reward, I guess.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.120
Chris has a highspeed camera

51:42.200 --> 51:45.680
to shoot super slow motion action
in the waves.

51:50.560 --> 51:54.960
The challenge is to get as close
to the waveriding dolphins as possible.

51:57.960 --> 52:01.920
The good news is that the dolphins
have been spotted on the horizon.

52:07.160 --> 52:10.880
Um, they said this was gonna be
the biggest swell of the year and...

52:11.360 --> 52:13.400
Hey, I've never seen anything like this.

52:13.480 --> 52:16.280
This is much bigger
that I'd possibly imagined.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.520
In these waves,

52:24.600 --> 52:28.480
the only way to get out to the dolphins
is with a jet ski.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.800
It's gonna be enough
of a challenge for them

52:31.880 --> 52:33.360
to just kind of weave their way out.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.080
At last,
the driver's detailed knowledge

53:01.160 --> 53:03.600
gets them safely
through the massive breakers,

53:06.280 --> 53:08.880
but the dolphins are nowhere to be seen.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.440
Leaving the crew to face
the hairraising task

53:15.520 --> 53:17.040
of getting back to shore.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.320
Keep going, keep going!

53:43.400 --> 53:44.520
Whoa!

53:48.120 --> 53:49.640
How was that?

53:49.720 --> 53:51.520
That was pretty wild, yeah.

53:51.720 --> 53:54.360
The wave actually hit
the back of the sled,

53:54.760 --> 53:57.176
and I was like, "Go, go.
Get out of here, guys. Get out of here."

53:57.200 --> 53:58.760
Heard a big bump and almost bounced off

53:58.800 --> 54:01.880
trying to hold the camera
and, um, just rode out of there,

54:01.960 --> 54:03.400
but, yeah, it was hectic.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.640
Just another day at the office.

54:11.760 --> 54:15.680
The next day brings
a sudden change in conditions.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.720
Plenty of dolphins...

54:22.520 --> 54:24.080
but a calmer sea.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.800
We've got a complete lack
of any wave at all.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.200
Look out, look out, look out.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.960
As so often in the ocean,

54:37.040 --> 54:38.960
if you know you're in the right place,

54:39.040 --> 54:42.400
you just need the patience
to wait for the perfect moment.

54:49.880 --> 54:52.960
A week later and a storm
is once again brewing

54:53.040 --> 54:57.280
off the wild coast and surf is building.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.080
Feel like a nervous excitement.

54:59.160 --> 55:03.280
The conditions are absolutely perfect.
It's what we've been waiting for.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.640
And the dolphins seem to know it.

55:08.480 --> 55:11.560
But Chris is struggling
to get a steady shot.

55:15.480 --> 55:16.760
Look at that.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.920
Hello, gentleman. This is tricky.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.880
Little tricky no the jet ski,
just trying to get the right angle.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.376
So, I'm gonna have a go on the zodiac

55:25.400 --> 55:27.400
and hopefully have better luck
on that one.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.360
The inflatable boat
gives Chris a larger,

55:42.440 --> 55:44.680
more stable filming platform.

55:47.720 --> 55:52.520
At last, he's in exactly the right place
at exactly the right time.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.920
And the results are spectacular.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.080
That's amazing!

56:11.320 --> 56:12.800
Mission accomplished.

56:19.760 --> 56:22.720
And this intimate footage
is now available

56:22.800 --> 56:25.640
as part of wider scientific studies.

56:29.400 --> 56:32.120
Supporting evidence that dolphins surf

56:32.240 --> 56:35.600
to strengthen friendships,
develop social skills

56:35.680 --> 56:39.360
and for the sheer exhilaration of it.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.240
Next time.

56:52.440 --> 56:53.800
The deep.

56:54.880 --> 56:57.800
A world richer
than we ever though possible,

56:59.200 --> 57:00.640
where creatures thrive,

57:02.400 --> 57:05.840
in the most extreme conditions on earth.
