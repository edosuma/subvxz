(buzzing)

03:44.804 --> 03:46.971
(buzzing)

04:51.530 --> 04:53.524
- We could be out here forever.

04:53.524 --> 04:56.040
- We've been out here forever.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.410
- Drax thinks there's one
out here so we have to look.

04:58.410 --> 05:01.110
- Even if we do find one, would it matter?

05:01.110 --> 05:02.850
Would it make a difference?

05:02.850 --> 05:04.930
It all seems so hopeless.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.230
- Hope is all we have now.

05:43.611 --> 05:47.947
I don't believe my eyes,
we finally found one.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.400
(dramatic music)

05:50.400 --> 05:51.833
Maybe now we have a chance.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.640
Radio the compound.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.602
- This is Scout Party Seven to compound.

05:57.602 --> 05:59.023
We have good news.

05:59.023 --> 06:02.356
We have found a robot, down, but intact.

06:06.647 --> 06:08.169
(thunder cracking)

06:08.169 --> 06:10.919
(dramatic music)

07:28.686 --> 07:31.436
(dramatic music)

07:37.250 --> 07:40.173
- You may rise and report your findings.

07:50.819 --> 07:53.069
(whizzing)

08:02.130 --> 08:04.273
- Today is Caesar's unlucky day.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.672
(buzzing)

08:19.080 --> 08:20.010
Report this.

08:20.010 --> 08:24.140
Don't move an inch, Mr.
Supreme Leader Caesar.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.320
Your rule has come to an end.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.790
Today the fighter's take the tide.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.467
You're nothing without your robots.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.549
- Perhaps so.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.803
(whizzing)

08:54.140 --> 08:55.173
That's better.

08:56.190 --> 08:57.790
We can accomplish nothing with you

08:57.790 --> 09:00.120
waving that crossbow in my face.

09:01.061 --> 09:03.200
- What the hell have you done to me?

09:03.200 --> 09:06.807
- Prove to you I can fight
just as well without robots.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.970
Why are you here, besides the obvious?

09:11.970 --> 09:14.143
- Trying to stop the reign of terror.

09:15.110 --> 09:16.663
- You failed.

09:16.663 --> 09:18.637
All of you have failed.

09:18.637 --> 09:23.113
The fighters are nothing,
scattered, beaten.

09:24.260 --> 09:27.060
Surrender and join our family.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.334
- We'd never submit to your cult

09:28.334 --> 09:31.913
of brainwashed death troopers.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.327
- Maybe Drax thinks otherwise.

09:39.725 --> 09:40.632
(beeping)

09:40.632 --> 09:42.421
- What is it?

09:42.421 --> 09:46.265
- I have something that
belongs to you, Drax.

09:46.265 --> 09:47.627
- Uh, Caesar.

09:47.627 --> 09:49.690
Damn you, let him go.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.843
- It's hopeless.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.730
Surrender to me or he dies.

09:55.973 --> 10:00.707
Then my robot, the
all-powerful robot, will march

10:00.707 --> 10:05.164
towards your base and bring
final death and destruction!

10:05.164 --> 10:07.160
- We'll never give in to you.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.073
We'll fight to the last
man and woman standing.

10:11.150 --> 10:12.207
- As you insist.

10:13.042 --> 10:16.187
- This is your last
chance to join our family.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.022
The next time we meet you will be begging

10:19.022 --> 10:23.240
for mercy on your your knees
and I will show you none!

10:23.240 --> 10:26.020
- Next time I see you, I'll
be sticking a robot's arm

10:26.020 --> 10:28.753
so far up your ass you'll
be spitting titanium!

10:28.753 --> 10:30.745
(beeping)

10:30.745 --> 10:31.722
(dramatic music)

10:31.722 --> 10:34.269
(cracking)

10:34.269 --> 10:37.102
(groaning softly)

10:39.799 --> 10:43.716
- Remove this groveling
human from the chamber.

10:58.037 --> 11:01.001
(beeping)

11:01.001 --> 11:06.001
My magnificent machine, soon
you will fulfill the destiny

11:06.444 --> 11:10.056
you were made for and destroy
the remaining fighters

11:10.056 --> 11:13.556
so we can be supreme rulers of this world!

11:22.858 --> 11:25.030
- Oh, damn him!

11:25.030 --> 11:25.863
- Drax, what is it?

11:25.863 --> 11:28.160
- Our mission to sabotage the robot

11:28.160 --> 11:31.140
and assassinate Caesar has failed!

11:31.140 --> 11:33.660
He's sending his robot
here to finish us off.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.660
We have to leave and hide for the hills.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.970
- We should do no such thing.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.036
- We'll be massacred.

11:39.036 --> 11:41.370
What chance do we have?

11:41.370 --> 11:43.920
- I say let's fight fire with fire.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.160
- What do you mean?

11:45.160 --> 11:47.823
I'm tired, stop talking in riddles.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.382
- Search party found a bot.

11:50.382 --> 11:51.420
- What?

11:51.420 --> 11:53.050
Fantastic, where?

11:53.050 --> 11:56.030
- In the Forbidden Zone, near
the core mine we call Janus.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.550
- That's one of the Class B mining bots.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.112
What do you think?

12:00.112 --> 12:02.440
What condition is it in?

12:02.440 --> 12:04.490
- It's in one piece, but it has suffered

12:04.490 --> 12:06.690
some damage due to the nuclear storms.

12:06.690 --> 12:07.550
- What's your opinion?

12:07.550 --> 12:08.733
Is it worth fixing?

12:09.630 --> 12:10.690
- It's worth a try.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.069
- Okay, I'll assemble a team.

12:12.069 --> 12:14.813
You be ready shortly so we
can assess the situation.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.940
Squirrel, hey, Squirrel.

12:59.010 --> 12:59.960
- Oh, hey, Drax.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.940
I finally got those
phaser plugs straightened.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.790
- Oh, don't worry about that.

13:02.790 --> 13:06.496
We've got a bigger matter to take care of.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.040
- What is it, Drax?

13:08.040 --> 13:09.929
- We found a bot in the Forbidden Zone.

13:09.929 --> 13:13.011
I need you to come with a
recon team to assess the unit

13:13.011 --> 13:15.660
to see if we can get it functional again.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.057
- It's probably been there a long time

13:17.057 --> 13:19.320
and corroded from all the storms.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.410
- Yeah, I know, but if
anybody can fix it you can.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.518
What do you say?

13:23.518 --> 13:25.282
- Of course, absolutely.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.740
I could be ready shortly.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.620
- Thanks and, Squirrel?

13:28.620 --> 13:29.453
- Yeah, boss?

13:29.453 --> 13:32.360
- If we don't get this bot
functioning, it's all over.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.359
Caesar's sending his
robot and death squads

13:34.359 --> 13:37.331
will arrive soon for a final annihilation.

13:37.331 --> 13:40.081
(dramatic music)

14:13.431 --> 14:16.890
- Almighty ones, you
have ordained this moment

14:16.890 --> 14:21.890
before time began, a time when I, Caesar,

14:21.953 --> 14:26.158
supreme leader of all, will march into

14:26.158 --> 14:29.403
final victory against the resistance.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.200
You have given us the mighty robots,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.513
metal saviors who bathe
in the task of ridding

14:36.513 --> 14:39.963
this broken world of
vermin and unworthy ones.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.787
We will rebuild a new world, a bold world

14:45.130 --> 14:48.150
where robots walk and I lead.

14:50.121 --> 14:54.130
As we pray, fill us
with your divine energy

14:54.130 --> 14:56.333
so we may complete this task at hand.

15:11.587 --> 15:14.337
(dramatic music)

15:15.238 --> 15:17.405
(beeping)

15:30.210 --> 15:32.377
(beeping)

15:54.670 --> 15:57.020
- Hey, Drax, is it true?

15:57.020 --> 15:59.220
You found a robot in the Forbidden Zone?

15:59.220 --> 16:00.053
- Yeah, we did.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.390
I'm assembling a team
now to go check it out.

16:03.390 --> 16:04.223
- I'm going, too.

16:04.223 --> 16:07.830
- No, I'd rather you stay here
and prepare for our defenses.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.141
- We are as fortified as we can get.

16:10.141 --> 16:13.990
Please let me go, for my father's sake.

16:13.990 --> 16:16.490
- Luna, I'm sorry about your father.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.630
- Then I can go?

16:17.630 --> 16:19.080
- Luna, I don't--

16:19.080 --> 16:22.630
- You know that I can bring
these robots back to life.

16:22.630 --> 16:25.383
My father built many of them
and I grew up helping him.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.601
- Okay, okay.

16:28.601 --> 16:31.450
Be ready in 10 minutes.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.571
- Alright, thanks, you won't regret it.

16:33.571 --> 16:34.980
- I already do.

16:34.980 --> 16:37.246
This time, Luna, it's due or die.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.425
- Alright, Drax.

16:38.425 --> 16:41.175
(dramatic music)

16:54.700 --> 16:57.907
- Yes, what do you have to report?

17:04.019 --> 17:05.910
- The fighters have found a bot.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.460
- Where?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.090
- In the Forbidden Zone.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.018
The fighters are checking out there,

17:10.018 --> 17:12.683
to see if it could be repaired.

17:12.683 --> 17:17.230
- This is very interesting
news, but don't worry.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.189
The search party won't make it back alive

17:19.189 --> 17:22.960
and the robot will remain non-functional.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.319
See to both

17:24.319 --> 17:25.670
- Yes, sir.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.210
- I will send out a greeting party

17:27.210 --> 17:29.683
to help them celebrate
their momentous find.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.790
- Let's take the Sector Seven pass.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.240
- Okay, everybody stick close.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.073
Follow, Luna.

17:38.073 --> 17:40.400
- Okay, I won't let her outta my sight.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.233
- I'm ready.

17:42.244 --> 17:44.994
(dramatic music)

19:12.495 --> 19:14.810
We better take shelter for a while.

19:14.810 --> 19:17.270
The sun is at its hottest
and our protective clothing

19:17.270 --> 19:19.670
won't keep us from being
burned for much longer.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.553
- Yeah, she's right.

19:23.772 --> 19:24.855
- Over there!

19:26.750 --> 19:28.103
Come on, that'll do!

19:44.702 --> 19:47.452
(dramatic music)

20:01.350 --> 20:02.653
Go easy on that.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.350
- Sure thing, Drax.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.290
- Who woulda thought the
world would come to this?

20:09.290 --> 20:11.683
- It was bound to happen sooner or later.

20:12.850 --> 20:14.660
Superpowers trigger-happy to be the

20:14.660 --> 20:17.840
last man standing and everyone falls.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.329
- Except the robots.

20:19.329 --> 20:23.420
- The robots, another one
of Man's great blunders.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.371
- Not so, they were built to aid Man,

20:25.371 --> 20:26.840
not go to war for him.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.480
- Well, it didn't turn
out that way, did it?

20:28.480 --> 20:32.713
- What do you know about
Caesar, what makes him tick?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.720
- He's like any other lunatic despot.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.627
Power-hungry, crazy with
a dark drive to conquer.

20:40.627 --> 20:41.750
(thunder cracking)

20:41.750 --> 20:44.810
Looking at Man as an obstacle rather

20:44.810 --> 20:47.320
than a bridge to a better world.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.689
- You have to admit, we
didn't do a very good job.

20:49.689 --> 20:53.980
- I suppose not, but, maybe we
can learn from our mistakes,

20:53.980 --> 20:55.650
make a better world.

20:55.650 --> 20:58.580
- Rebuild the world in a field of ashes?

20:58.580 --> 21:00.920
Almost sounds like a joke.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.590
- No more comedic than Caesar and his cult

21:03.590 --> 21:05.575
of robot worshipers.

21:05.575 --> 21:08.520
- I wonder what the fascination is?

21:08.520 --> 21:11.210
- Maybe he just like playing with toys.

21:11.210 --> 21:12.850
- Giant toys.

21:12.850 --> 21:14.780
Those robots were built to mine elements

21:14.780 --> 21:16.600
out of the Earth's core.

21:16.600 --> 21:21.550
- I just wonder what the rest
of the world is doing now.

21:21.550 --> 21:23.800
- We may be the rest of the word.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.980
- There may be other
survivors on other continents,

21:25.980 --> 21:28.090
fighting to survive just like us.

21:28.090 --> 21:32.280
- Billions were killed during
the Great Nuclear Exchange.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.920
Survivors slowly were killed
off by the radiation poison.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.050
- We made it.

21:38.050 --> 21:39.003
- We were lucky.

21:39.983 --> 21:42.840
- I think the lucky ones died first.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.790
We have to see it through to the death.

21:55.754 --> 21:58.504
(dramatic music)

22:14.728 --> 22:17.860
(sighs)
It's over there all right.

22:17.860 --> 22:19.960
In pretty rough shape though.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.240
- Hey, as long as it has enough power

22:21.240 --> 22:24.107
to stop Caesar where he
stands I'll be happy.

22:24.107 --> 22:26.040
- Halt, drop your weapons.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.781
- Now what?

22:34.781 --> 22:35.948
- Now you die.

22:49.393 --> 22:50.226
- Now!

22:54.813 --> 22:57.340
(weapon firing)

22:57.340 --> 23:00.007
(weapon firing)

23:01.964 --> 23:04.279
(groaning)

23:04.279 --> 23:06.946
(weapon firing)

23:08.602 --> 23:11.661
(groaning)

23:11.661 --> 23:14.328
(weapon firing)

23:22.833 --> 23:25.166
(exploding)

23:39.671 --> 23:42.421
(engine revving)

23:45.396 --> 23:46.229
- Damn.

23:51.251 --> 23:53.470
I tried to get him, but he got away.

23:53.470 --> 23:54.303
- No worries.

23:54.303 --> 23:56.700
We've bought ourselves enough time.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.810
- I thought for a second, Squirrel,

23:57.810 --> 24:00.720
you were running away
with him, not after him.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.553
- Very funny.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.970
- You work on the robot, we'll
take care of these bodies.

24:06.970 --> 24:07.920
- You got it, boss.

24:09.184 --> 24:10.884
- Here, we can bury him over here.

24:11.948 --> 24:14.698
(dramatic music)

24:27.942 --> 24:29.970
- Hey, Squirrel, what do you think?

24:29.970 --> 24:31.082
- This baby's seen better days,

24:31.082 --> 24:33.740
but I think I can get it functioning.

24:33.740 --> 24:34.800
- Great.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.202
- Don't celebrate too fast.

24:36.202 --> 24:37.680
It can't be moved.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.270
We'll have to repair it here.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.330
- Okay.

24:40.330 --> 24:41.741
Well, I'll have the equipment and tools

24:41.741 --> 24:43.740
brought by another team member.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.650
Finish up and let us know what you need.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.483
- Will do.

24:49.039 --> 24:51.040
- He thinks he can fix it.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.189
Once he's done with his inspection,

24:52.189 --> 24:54.863
we'll radio back to the
base for parts and tools.

24:55.970 --> 24:58.533
- Finally, a stroke of
luck for the good guys.

25:09.452 --> 25:10.285
- My lord.

25:11.712 --> 25:15.500
- You bring good news of
the fighter's extermination?

25:15.500 --> 25:18.073
- We were defeated, taken by surprise.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.164
- I see, no worries.

25:22.164 --> 25:26.003
Our robot will finish the
job where you have failed.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.483
(electric crackling)

25:32.490 --> 25:34.730
And what of our great defender, the robot?

25:34.730 --> 25:37.320
- It will be operational and ready

25:37.320 --> 25:39.405
for extermination shortly.

25:39.405 --> 25:40.340
- Very good.

25:40.340 --> 25:44.240
Now, please, clean up this mess.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.073
- Yes, my lord.

25:48.094 --> 25:53.094
(dramatic music)
(wind howling)

26:28.340 --> 26:30.743
- Drax needs these tools to fix the bot.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.300
They shouldn't be too much farther.

27:16.806 --> 27:18.967
- You know, I've always wondered what one

27:18.967 --> 27:22.290
of these things looked
like underneath that mask.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.207
- Go ahead.

27:27.107 --> 27:28.320
- Oh.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.039
- Oh!

27:30.039 --> 27:32.353
- Oh, it's hideous!

27:32.353 --> 27:34.940
Is this what Caesar has planned for us?

27:34.940 --> 27:37.100
- We won't be captured to
be one of his cult members.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.582
We'll be killed!

27:38.582 --> 27:41.523
- Well, I'd prefer that than
becoming one of these things.

27:50.987 --> 27:52.159
- The battle bot is ready.

27:52.159 --> 27:53.742
We await your word.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.092
- Destroy them!

27:58.133 --> 27:59.423
- [Henchman] Yes, my lord.

28:04.711 --> 28:05.544
- Yes.

28:06.542 --> 28:07.375
Yes.

28:11.519 --> 28:13.686
(beeping)

28:31.982 --> 28:34.230
- What is it, Scorpion?

28:34.230 --> 28:36.713
Can't seem to take your eyes off Squirrel.

28:37.693 --> 28:40.010
What do you have a crush
on him or something?

28:40.010 --> 28:41.200
- Far from it.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.683
I prefer Drax myself.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.543
- Mm, so would I.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.813
Hopefully we won't have to fight over him.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.170
- I don't think we have
to worry about that.

28:52.170 --> 28:53.823
He barely notices us.

28:54.790 --> 28:59.120
But, Squirrel, I just don't trust him.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.688
- He's harmless.

29:00.688 --> 29:02.653
Eccentric, but harmless.

29:03.838 --> 29:05.483
He's a damn good mechanic.

29:07.059 --> 29:08.303
- Maybe he's more.

29:13.032 --> 29:14.672
- Well, I'm just about ready.

29:14.672 --> 29:16.172
- We have company.

29:31.677 --> 29:33.930
What's the range on that remote?

29:33.930 --> 29:34.949
- I had to stay pretty close.

29:34.949 --> 29:38.053
The signal might get
interrupted, it's pretty old.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.820
- Alright, people, this is it.

29:56.176 --> 29:58.926
(dramatic music)

30:12.391 --> 30:14.150
(weapon firing)

30:14.150 --> 30:16.260
- Do we have lasers on our back?

30:16.260 --> 30:17.333
- We sure do.

30:17.333 --> 30:18.803
- Then use them!

30:20.761 --> 30:21.908
(weapon firing)

30:21.908 --> 30:24.107
(sparking)

30:24.107 --> 30:29.107
(weapons firing)
(exploding)

30:32.708 --> 30:34.166
(weapons firing)

30:34.166 --> 30:36.018
(exploding)

30:36.018 --> 30:38.768
(weapons firing)

30:40.694 --> 30:43.027
(exploding)

31:00.192 --> 31:02.859
(weapon firing)

31:07.557 --> 31:09.413
(sparking)

31:09.413 --> 31:12.080
(weapon firing)

31:15.169 --> 31:17.836
(weapon firing)

31:18.976 --> 31:21.309
(exploding)

31:52.997 --> 31:55.247
(clanging)

32:27.341 --> 32:28.850
(clanging)

32:28.850 --> 32:29.770
(buzzing)

32:29.770 --> 32:30.603
- Oh no!

32:30.603 --> 32:31.560
- What is it?

32:31.560 --> 32:33.800
- One of the fuel cell
catalysts is damaged.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.210
- What does that mean?

32:35.210 --> 32:37.330
- We lost power to the main brain control.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.495
It can't function.

32:38.495 --> 32:40.750
- Damn.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.000
(clanging)

32:55.003 --> 32:57.170
(buzzing)

33:04.891 --> 33:05.808
Take cover!

33:07.590 --> 33:08.507
- This way!

33:18.204 --> 33:20.706
(groaning)

33:20.706 --> 33:22.956
(smashing)

33:27.346 --> 33:29.596
(smashing)

33:30.795 --> 33:31.628
Let me go!

33:35.360 --> 33:37.610
(smashing)

33:41.473 --> 33:42.306
- Luna!

33:43.290 --> 33:44.997
- Don't, you'll shoot her!

34:01.699 --> 34:03.366
- Oh, they got Luna.

34:04.630 --> 34:05.580
- Where's Squirrel?

34:06.520 --> 34:07.745
- He must have been crushed by the robot

34:07.745 --> 34:09.880
or kidnapped with Luna.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.280
- Who would want him?

34:11.280 --> 34:13.947
- Well, he understands bots,
that makes him valuable.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.288
- What now?

34:15.288 --> 34:16.132
It's hopeless.

34:16.132 --> 34:17.502
- Let's head back to the base and

34:17.502 --> 34:19.770
get our weapons and fighters and let's

34:19.770 --> 34:22.659
launch one last assault on Caesar's base.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.743
- Damn straight.

34:26.571 --> 34:29.321
(dramatic music)

34:31.250 --> 34:32.083
- Let me go!

34:34.540 --> 34:36.382
- In due time, my dear.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.601
- You're insane!

34:39.601 --> 34:40.434
A madman.

34:41.293 --> 34:44.513
- You'll change your mind
in that regard, as well.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.469
- Never.

34:47.469 --> 34:49.120
Where are the others?

34:49.120 --> 34:50.333
- We believe they may have fled

34:50.333 --> 34:53.150
after your robot was defeated.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.286
Or they were killed in the attack.

34:55.286 --> 34:57.014
We're still searching.

34:57.014 --> 35:00.932
Either way, the revolt
is over, for all of you.

35:02.666 --> 35:07.310
- If anyone survived, they will be back.

35:07.310 --> 35:10.357
We will fight until the last person.

35:10.357 --> 35:12.400
- I love that spirit.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.823
Don't lose it when I make you my bride.

35:16.709 --> 35:17.926
- What?

35:17.926 --> 35:19.256
Bride?

35:19.256 --> 35:21.498
- You belong to me now.

35:21.498 --> 35:24.250
I am taking you as my bride.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.484
A plush ceremony will be held in our honor

35:26.484 --> 35:30.545
after we crush the remaining fighters.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.174
Sparing your life will be a wonderful

35:32.174 --> 35:35.137
wedding present, won't it?

35:35.137 --> 35:38.358
- Never, I would never agree to that!

35:38.358 --> 35:41.525
- I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!

35:43.047 --> 35:46.868
Like it or not, you will be my bride.

35:46.868 --> 35:50.560
Revel in the fact that you
will at least be alive.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.727
Take her away!

36:16.805 --> 36:18.819
- You can do this, not much further.

36:18.819 --> 36:19.842
Come on.

36:19.842 --> 36:22.493
Come on, you can do this.

36:22.493 --> 36:23.716
Keep moving, come on.

36:23.716 --> 36:25.466
Come on, up, come on.

36:26.503 --> 36:27.336
Come on.

36:27.336 --> 36:28.548
We got this.

36:28.548 --> 36:30.715
Not much further, come on.

36:48.425 --> 36:50.960
- I wondered when you would get here.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.800
- I put on a good show for the fighters.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.174
- That robot they found was
a lot tougher than yours,

36:56.174 --> 37:00.400
but I made sure it was
only operating at 30%.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.593
- You've done well my treacherous friend.

37:03.593 --> 37:07.221
- I'll be rewarded, like you promised?

37:07.221 --> 37:12.221
- Yes, but I have one
more thing for you to do.

37:12.238 --> 37:14.988
(dramatic music)

37:15.961 --> 37:16.983
(static buzzing)

37:16.983 --> 37:19.150
(beeping)

37:20.677 --> 37:22.594
- Transmission started.

37:23.548 --> 37:27.900
This is MAP227, freedom fighter.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.990
We've been trying to
connect with you for weeks,

37:29.990 --> 37:32.980
but these droids, they
have us pinned down.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.290
We're in an old building somewhere

37:34.290 --> 37:36.550
in the middle of a town, a city.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.150
We don't even know where, we're just.

37:38.150 --> 37:40.560
We're trying to reach somebody, anybody.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.690
If you receive this transmission, please,

37:43.690 --> 37:46.340
please get a hold of us.

37:46.340 --> 37:48.400
Find us, help us.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.130
There's very few of us and we can't

37:50.130 --> 37:52.241
hold these droids off any more.

37:52.241 --> 37:56.750
We tried, we desperately
tried to make a difference,

37:56.750 --> 37:59.640
to fight for the cause of humanity.

37:59.640 --> 38:04.640
To defeat this crazy overlord
of the New Order, Caesar.

38:05.188 --> 38:06.910
We've heard rumors.

38:06.910 --> 38:11.477
We've heard rumors of one last
attempt to overthrow Caesar.

38:13.770 --> 38:17.610
You need to find a robot
somewhere out there.

38:17.610 --> 38:21.180
There are robots that
can be programmed, manned

38:21.180 --> 38:22.918
and fight back.

38:22.918 --> 38:27.520
We hope with all our heart
that you're doing this,

38:27.520 --> 38:29.680
that it has already been done.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.240
We simply don't know.

38:31.240 --> 38:36.240
Once again, this is MAP207 from somewhere,

38:36.340 --> 38:39.970
somewhere in the United
States, seeking help.

38:39.970 --> 38:41.913
Please, come quickly.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.323
Come quickly.

38:46.323 --> 38:48.409
(static buzzing)

38:48.409 --> 38:52.002
(flames crackling)

38:52.002 --> 38:54.752
(dramatic music)

38:55.921 --> 38:57.193
- We're too late.

38:59.290 --> 39:01.390
- [Drax] Caesar's goons were already here.

39:03.110 --> 39:06.233
- There's no one left, everyone's dead.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.063
- We could do no more here.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.920
- This is a suicide mission,
we won't make it back.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.550
- At least we'll go down fighting.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.400
There's nothing left to come back to.

39:25.150 --> 39:27.900
(fire crackling)

39:29.310 --> 39:32.060
(dramatic music)

40:08.089 --> 40:10.339
(groaning)

40:22.093 --> 40:24.373
- I can't eat without my hands.

40:26.020 --> 40:27.800
You're gonna have to untie me.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.680
- Uh.
(spitting)

40:34.680 --> 40:39.680
Uh, what is that, you bastard?

40:41.037 --> 40:45.337
Uh.
(spitting)

40:54.997 --> 40:57.997
- Save your energy, my pretty bride.

41:02.268 --> 41:05.018
- Cycle tracks, they go this way.

41:10.124 --> 41:12.139
Squirrel!

41:12.139 --> 41:13.388
Squirrel.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.221
- Hey.

41:20.277 --> 41:22.262
- Squirrel, are you okay?

41:22.262 --> 41:24.023
- What happened?

41:24.023 --> 41:26.880
- During the fight I was
captured along with Luna,

41:26.880 --> 41:29.411
but I managed to escape.

41:29.411 --> 41:31.090
- Where is she?

41:31.090 --> 41:33.120
- Caesar's compound, I guess.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.860
- Then that's where we're headed.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.250
Not alone.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.320
- What do you mean?

41:37.320 --> 41:39.560
- If we can, we'll get the robot fixed

41:39.560 --> 41:41.540
for one final assault.

41:41.540 --> 41:42.890
- It's probably inoperable.

41:43.790 --> 41:45.960
- That's what you'll find out for us.

41:45.960 --> 41:46.793
Come on.

41:57.125 --> 41:59.875
(dramatic music)

42:03.497 --> 42:06.214
- I don't buy his story.

42:06.214 --> 42:07.737
- You're very suspicious of him.

42:07.737 --> 42:09.479
What are you thinking?

42:09.479 --> 42:11.486
- Well, I find it hard
to believe he escaped

42:11.486 --> 42:14.390
from Caesar's sentries on his own.

42:14.390 --> 42:15.830
And I noticed when he was working

42:15.830 --> 42:19.069
on that bot he wired a
few things backwards.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.609
- Wait, he fixed it, didn't he?

42:21.609 --> 42:25.470
- Yeah, he fixed it alright,
he fixed it to lose.

42:25.470 --> 42:26.970
Did you ever think about that?

42:28.010 --> 42:30.170
I don't know, I don't trust him.

42:30.170 --> 42:31.220
Keep your eye on him.

42:52.326 --> 42:55.440
- There it is, no sentries in sight.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.540
- I'll look for the controller

42:56.540 --> 42:59.850
while you guys figure out
what's wrong with our tin giant.

42:59.850 --> 43:01.083
- We'll be on the lookout.

43:50.537 --> 43:51.370
- Yes!

43:54.110 --> 43:55.860
Mission accomplished.
- Fantastic!

43:55.860 --> 43:58.672
We think the failure
was due to bad wiring.

43:58.672 --> 44:01.096
Let's let Squirrel work his magic.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.193
- I'll get to it.

44:13.078 --> 44:15.328
(groaning)

44:33.820 --> 44:36.293
Squirrel to Caesar, this
is Squirrel to Caesar.

44:38.015 --> 44:40.220
(buzzing)

44:40.220 --> 44:41.657
- Who were you talking to?

44:41.657 --> 44:43.441
- No one, Drax.

44:43.441 --> 44:45.350
- We heard you?

44:45.350 --> 44:47.040
We heard you say Caesar.

44:47.040 --> 44:48.700
Are you in bed with him?

44:48.700 --> 44:51.010
- You don't understand,
it's not what it looks like.

44:51.010 --> 44:52.471
- It looks like you're a traitor.

44:52.471 --> 44:54.760
- How could you double cross us?

44:54.760 --> 44:59.320
Caesar only wants to kill
us, all of us, including you.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.010
- He promised me power and great wealth.

45:02.010 --> 45:04.100
- He lied to you and when he gets done

45:04.100 --> 45:06.170
with you he's gonna kill you, too!

45:06.170 --> 45:08.249
- He won't, I brought him.

45:08.249 --> 45:09.543
- You gave him who?

45:10.490 --> 45:11.547
- I brought him Luna.

45:11.547 --> 45:13.750
She's to be his bride.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.277
- You're not getting an invitation!

45:15.277 --> 45:17.944
(weapon firing)

45:19.670 --> 45:21.600
The bastard deserved it.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.070
- What now, boss?

45:23.070 --> 45:24.520
- Get the bot functional and pointed

45:24.520 --> 45:26.422
towards Caesar's compound.

45:26.422 --> 45:28.050
- What are you gonna do?

45:28.050 --> 45:31.060
- I'm gonna go ahead
and try and rescue Luna.

45:31.060 --> 45:34.240
You start the assault
whether I'm back or not.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.073
- Got it.

45:35.073 --> 45:35.906
Be careful.

45:45.098 --> 45:47.348
- Fool, your time has come.

45:55.554 --> 45:58.694
Send out a greeting
party to finish off Drax.

45:58.694 --> 46:01.730
Then go after the girl
when they have the bot.

46:01.730 --> 46:05.647
My wedding will not be
interrupted by infidels.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.190
(groaning)

46:34.684 --> 46:36.737
You are so beautiful.

46:36.737 --> 46:41.737
I hope in time you come to
desire me the way I desire you.

46:42.144 --> 46:44.630
- I would kill myself
first opportunity I got

46:44.630 --> 46:46.883
before I even let you touch me.

46:47.939 --> 46:51.530
- I plan on doing more than
touching you, my flower.

46:51.530 --> 46:53.750
You will bear our children so we can

46:53.750 --> 46:56.047
create a monarchy all our own.

46:57.430 --> 47:00.703
- You're crazy, the
fighters are gonna stop you!

47:01.740 --> 47:05.061
- I hardly think so, they
are all but destroyed.

47:05.061 --> 47:07.487
The remaining few are being dealt with.

47:07.487 --> 47:11.850
You are all that is left
of the fledgling rebellion!

47:11.850 --> 47:13.140
- You're lying!

47:13.140 --> 47:15.470
- You don't have to believe me,

47:15.470 --> 47:17.310
but think on it.

47:17.310 --> 47:19.198
I'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.

47:19.198 --> 47:21.948
(dramatic music)

47:47.171 --> 47:49.838
(weapon firing)

47:52.830 --> 47:54.470
- That was close.

47:54.470 --> 47:56.269
- I was about to tear him apart!

47:56.269 --> 47:58.170
- From my vantage point, it looked like

47:58.170 --> 47:59.840
they were ready to tear you apart.

47:59.840 --> 48:02.330
- I had it under control.

48:02.330 --> 48:04.780
It looks like you got
the robot under control.

48:04.780 --> 48:06.980
- I still have some modifications to make.

48:06.980 --> 48:08.623
I was just sliding in the laser.

48:18.251 --> 48:21.001
(dramatic music)

48:35.363 --> 48:39.017
- Oh, finally.

48:39.017 --> 48:41.017
Get the hell outta here.

49:18.461 --> 49:23.260
(groaning)
(growling)

49:23.260 --> 49:25.343
- Sleep, my bride, sleep.

49:48.211 --> 49:50.961
(dramatic music)

50:15.316 --> 50:18.233
- Alright, big boy, let's move out.

50:37.170 --> 50:40.170
(crickets chirping)

51:01.581 --> 51:06.581
(waves crashing)
(upbeat music)

51:41.220 --> 51:44.073
- Squirrel to Caesar, this
is Squirrel to Caesar.

51:45.182 --> 51:47.590
(buzzing)

51:47.590 --> 51:49.500
- Who were you talking to?

51:49.500 --> 51:51.150
- No one, Drax.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.760
- We heard you.

51:52.760 --> 51:54.450
We heard you say Caesar.

51:54.450 --> 51:56.110
Are you in bed with him?

51:56.110 --> 51:58.440
- You don't understand,
it's not what it looks like.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.170
- It looks like you're a traitor.

52:00.170 --> 52:02.180
- How could you double cross us?

52:02.180 --> 52:06.830
Caesar only wants to kill
us, all of us, including you.

52:06.830 --> 52:09.410
- He promised me power and great wealth.

52:09.410 --> 52:11.157
- He lied to you and when he gets done

52:11.157 --> 52:13.221
with you he's gonna kill you, too!

52:13.221 --> 52:15.310
- He won't, I brought him.

52:15.310 --> 52:17.023
- You gave him who?

52:17.880 --> 52:21.120
- I brought him Luna,
she's to be his bride.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.740
- You're not getting an invitation!

52:22.740 --> 52:25.407
(weapon firing)

52:46.658 --> 52:49.241
- Lord Caesar wants to see you.

52:50.730 --> 52:52.980
(groaning)

53:10.807 --> 53:13.443
- Luna, my soon to be bride,

53:14.340 --> 53:17.140
I want to offer you some
entertainment before our union.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.831
Look, my magnificent machine is marching

53:20.831 --> 53:23.090
to annihilate what's left
of your fighter friends,

53:23.090 --> 53:27.791
and their third world
serves just to hold us back.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.541
- I don't wanna look.

53:30.890 --> 53:34.963
- You can do as you like,
but the finale is here.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.683
- Drax, he's still alive.

53:44.810 --> 53:46.400
- Not for long.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.990
He's only being prolonged
for the sake of mankind.

53:49.990 --> 53:51.791
He knows it's all over.

53:51.791 --> 53:52.624
Finished.

53:53.548 --> 53:55.313
- We'll just see how this ends.

53:57.210 --> 53:58.573
- Yes, we shall.

54:12.481 --> 54:16.231
- Here we go, rock 'em,
sock 'em battle bots.

54:40.674 --> 54:45.117
Oh, what the hell.

54:45.117 --> 54:48.181
(weapons firing)

54:48.181 --> 54:50.431
(sparking)

54:52.322 --> 54:55.072
(weapons firing)

54:59.537 --> 55:04.537
(weapons firing)
(exploding)

55:06.074 --> 55:11.074
(weapons firing)
(exploding)

55:26.996 --> 55:29.746
(weapons firing)

55:33.952 --> 55:35.959
(crackling)

55:35.959 --> 55:40.959
(weapons firing)
(exploding)

55:51.768 --> 55:54.018
(clanging)

56:13.741 --> 56:15.991
(clanging)

56:45.266 --> 56:47.516
(clanging)

57:03.003 --> 57:06.243
- Send out a party to eliminate her, now!

57:07.270 --> 57:08.103
- Immediately.

57:09.820 --> 57:11.720
- Things aren't going as planned, huh?

57:12.800 --> 57:15.157
- Our battle bot is undefeatable!

57:16.930 --> 57:21.930
- Oh yeah, that's why you sent
out a contingency plan then.

57:21.982 --> 57:22.815
- Silence!

57:51.624 --> 57:54.848
- That was easier than I thought.

57:54.848 --> 57:56.422
Now to find Luna.

57:56.422 --> 57:59.172
(dramatic music)

58:35.021 --> 58:37.271
(clanging)

58:47.518 --> 58:49.685
(buzzing)

58:52.174 --> 58:54.841
(weapon firing)

59:11.662 --> 59:13.603
- This can't be happening!

59:13.603 --> 59:16.290
The battle bot is going berserk!

59:17.753 --> 59:20.353
- Hopefully he'll come back
here and finish the job.

59:33.770 --> 59:36.757
Oh my lord, I have a surprise for you.

59:38.998 --> 59:40.698
- What is it?

59:40.698 --> 59:41.531
- This!

59:42.718 --> 59:44.438
(weapon firing)

59:44.438 --> 59:46.605
(buzzing)

59:54.415 --> 59:55.248
- No!

59:56.811 --> 59:57.978
I want to rule

59:59.566 --> 01:00:00.399
forever!

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.533
- What a shocker.

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:16.330
- I don't, I don't even wanna know.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.890
- It's over, it's finally over.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.480
- The robot!

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.050
The sentries took out Scorpion.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.170
Our bot is out there unmanned!

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:26.540
- Then we have to get to
it and finish the job.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.473
They aren't far.

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:49.684
- Over there!

01:00:51.954 --> 01:00:54.704
(weapons firing)

01:00:57.275 --> 01:00:59.516
(groaning)

01:00:59.516 --> 01:01:02.183
(weapon firing)

01:01:03.508 --> 01:01:05.758
(groaning)

01:01:06.688 --> 01:01:09.355
(weapon firing)

01:01:18.686 --> 01:01:20.936
(clanging)

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:50.125
(clanging)

01:01:53.985 --> 01:01:56.418
- It doesn't have much life in it, but.

01:01:56.418 --> 01:01:57.300
- What?

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.460
- If their bot stays directly behind ours,

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.663
I think I can expel enough
exhaust here to burn theirs up.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:08.683
- Do it!

01:02:28.057 --> 01:02:30.307
(clanging)

01:02:38.441 --> 01:02:40.691
(clanging)

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:09.973
- Now!

01:03:11.216 --> 01:03:13.549
(exploding)

01:03:23.252 --> 01:03:24.455
(weapon firing)

01:03:24.455 --> 01:03:29.455
(exploding)
(flames crackling)

01:03:30.115 --> 01:03:32.782
(weapon firing)

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.480
Is it really over?

01:03:56.943 --> 01:03:59.110
- No, it's just beginning.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.700
(dramatic music)

01:06:39.675 --> 01:06:42.258
(upbeat music)

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:06.536
(dramatic music)

01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:39.485
