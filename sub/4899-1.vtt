03:37.120 --> 03:40.204
- Colonel Sandurz!
- What is it, Sergeant Ricco?

03:42.457 --> 03:46.373
You told me to let you know the moment
Planet Druidia was in sight, sir.

03:46.503 --> 03:49.043
- So?
- Planet Druidia's in sight, sir.

03:50.007 --> 03:52.047
You're really a Spaceball.

03:52.177 --> 03:54.798
- You know that, don't you?
- Thanks, sir.

03:54.929 --> 03:58.380
- Have you notified Lord Helmet?
- Yes, sir. He's on his way.

03:58.514 --> 04:00.555
Make way for Dark Helmet.

04:00.683 --> 04:03.769
All rise in the presence of Dark Helmet.

04:52.652 --> 04:54.893
I can't breathe in this thing!

04:55.904 --> 04:58.573
- We're approaching Planet Druidia, sir.
- Good.

04:59.157 --> 05:02.112
I'll call Spaceball City
and notify President Skroob.

05:02.244 --> 05:05.280
I already called him, sir.
He knows everything.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.743
What?

05:08.875 --> 05:11.247
You went over my helmet?

05:11.378 --> 05:14.212
Not exactly over, sir.
Uh, m-m-more to the side.

05:14.338 --> 05:18.039
I'll always call you first.
It'll never happen again. Never, ever!

05:19.886 --> 05:21.712
Oh, shit!

05:21.846 --> 05:23.887
No, no, no, no! No, no!

05:24.016 --> 05:27.265
Please, please, please! No, no, not that!

05:28.727 --> 05:30.553
Yes, that.

05:49.373 --> 05:51.413
- Sandurz!
- Sir?

05:51.542 --> 05:53.748
I don't see Planet Druidia. Where is it?

05:53.877 --> 05:57.791
We have it on the radar screen.
Shall I punch it up for you?

05:57.923 --> 06:00.628
- Nah, I'll do it myself.
- Very good, sir.

06:04.554 --> 06:08.219
What's the matter with this thing?
You call that a radar screen?

06:08.351 --> 06:10.888
No, sir. We call it... Mr Coffee.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.643
Care for some?

06:13.772 --> 06:15.230
Yes!

06:15.358 --> 06:18.227
- I always have coffee when I watch radar.
- Of course.

06:18.359 --> 06:21.147
- Everybody knows that.
- Of course we do, sir.

06:23.031 --> 06:26.531
Now that I have my coffee,
I'm ready to watch radar.

06:26.659 --> 06:28.486
Where is it?

06:28.620 --> 06:31.538
- Right here, sir.
- Switch to teleview.

06:32.748 --> 06:34.990
There it is. Planet Druidia.

06:35.126 --> 06:38.246
And under the air shield
10,000 years of fresh air.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.334
- We must get through the shield.
- We will, sir.

06:41.465 --> 06:46.887
Once we kidnap the princess, her father'll
give us the combination to the air shield,

06:47.012 --> 06:51.259
thereby destroying Planet Druidia
and saving Planet Spaceball.

06:51.391 --> 06:53.431
Everybody got that?

06:53.937 --> 06:57.519
- Good. When will the princess marry?
- Within the hour, sir.

06:57.649 --> 07:02.274
Well, I hope it's a long ceremony,
cos it's gonna be a short honeymoon.

07:09.993 --> 07:13.160
Hot! Too hot!

07:29.095 --> 07:32.429
Oh, if only your mother
were alive to see this day.

07:32.558 --> 07:34.596
- Everyone ready?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

07:34.727 --> 07:38.557
- No. Where's my droid of honour?
- Oh, dear, yes! Where's Dot?

07:38.688 --> 07:40.098
Dot!

07:40.231 --> 07:42.271
Dot Matrix!

07:42.399 --> 07:44.440
Oh, thank God.

07:44.944 --> 07:46.983
- Where have you been?
- Here I am.

07:47.113 --> 07:49.189
Sorry. I had to make a pit stop.

07:49.323 --> 07:52.028
I'm so excited, I couldn't hold my oil.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.029
All right, people. It's magic time.

07:55.162 --> 07:57.782
Right, everyone starting on the left foot.

07:57.915 --> 08:01.117
- Daddy, that's your right foot.
- It's too late. Keep going.

08:14.723 --> 08:16.762
Daddy?

08:17.559 --> 08:21.770
- Must I go through with this?
- I'm sorry, my dear. You have to.

08:31.572 --> 08:33.611
But, Daddy?

08:34.491 --> 08:36.318
I don't love him.

08:36.452 --> 08:39.866
I'm sorry, Vespa.
He's the last prince left in the galaxy.

08:50.549 --> 08:55.507
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
on this most joyous occasion

08:55.637 --> 08:59.717
to witness Princess Vespa,
daughter of King Roland,

08:59.851 --> 09:04.228
going right past the altar,
heading down the ramp, and out the door!

09:04.564 --> 09:07.730
Stop her! Someone, stop her! Stop her!

09:08.400 --> 09:11.186
Hey, wait! You forgot to get married.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.063
Will you stop?

09:13.196 --> 09:17.195
- What are you doing?
- No questions, Dot. Get in!

09:27.376 --> 09:30.164
Where is she going?! Where is she going?

09:34.425 --> 09:36.501
Come ba...

09:36.635 --> 09:38.047
..ck!

10:35.360 --> 10:37.400
Barf...

10:39.906 --> 10:41.945
Barf.

10:43.158 --> 10:45.197
Ba-arf!

10:46.286 --> 10:47.485
Huh?

10:51.542 --> 10:54.459
- Barf?
- Always when I'm eating.

10:59.924 --> 11:01.965
Barf!

11:03.887 --> 11:05.927
- What can I do you for?
- Where you been?

11:06.056 --> 11:08.428
- Grabbin' a snack. Want some?
- No.

11:08.558 --> 11:11.762
- Little hair of the dog?
- No! Listen, answer that for me.

11:11.895 --> 11:13.935
- Will you watch that?
- Oh, sorry.

11:14.064 --> 11:17.894
I'll just throw on your audio.
That way they won't see you.

11:18.026 --> 11:21.560
- Y'hello!
- Hello, Lone Starr.

11:21.696 --> 11:23.321
Sorry, wrong switch.

11:23.448 --> 11:25.773
Hello, Vinnie. What do you want?

11:25.909 --> 11:29.657
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not what I want.

11:29.788 --> 11:32.742
It's what he wants.

11:35.335 --> 11:38.003
Pizza The Hutt!

11:38.128 --> 11:41.214
Well, if it isn't Lone Starr

11:41.340 --> 11:44.009
and his sidekick, Puke.

11:44.552 --> 11:48.466
- That's Barf.
- Barf, Puke, whatever!

11:49.098 --> 11:53.345
- Where's my money?
- Don't worry. You'll have it by next week.

11:53.477 --> 11:56.051
No, no. I gotta have it by tomorrow.

11:56.688 --> 11:59.774
A hundred thousand space bucks...
by tomorrow?!

11:59.900 --> 12:01.939
A hundred thousand?

12:02.443 --> 12:05.648
No way! You forgot late charges,

12:05.781 --> 12:09.778
which brings it up to,
uh... one million space bucks.

12:09.911 --> 12:13.278
A million?! That's unfair.

12:13.412 --> 12:15.572
Unfair to the pay-or,

12:15.707 --> 12:17.829
but not to the pay-ee.

12:20.546 --> 12:22.834
But you're gonna pay it

12:22.965 --> 12:24.589
or else.

12:25.549 --> 12:29.050
- Or else what?
- Tell him, Vinnie.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.220
Or else Pizza

12:33.349 --> 12:36.054
is gonna send out for you.

12:43.276 --> 12:44.901
You're delicious.

12:45.028 --> 12:47.067
Ciao, boys.

13:11.053 --> 13:13.093
Can we talk?

13:13.221 --> 13:16.258
OK, we all know Prince Valium is a pill.

13:16.391 --> 13:20.804
But you could've married him for your
father, then had a headache for 25 years.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.771
Will you turn that thing off?

13:29.028 --> 13:30.856
What?

13:31.197 --> 13:33.024
What is it?

13:33.158 --> 13:36.444
I was saying,
do you realise what you've done?

13:36.578 --> 13:38.820
Yes! And I'm glad.

13:38.955 --> 13:42.040
Glad, glad, glad, glad, glad.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.743
I wonder if she's glad.

13:53.636 --> 13:55.675
Don't be ridiculous!

13:55.805 --> 13:59.968
As president of Planet Spaceball,
I can assure both you and your viewers

14:00.101 --> 14:03.849
that there's absolutely
no air shortage whatsoever.

14:03.979 --> 14:07.348
Yes, of course.
I've heard the same rumour myself.

14:07.482 --> 14:11.646
Yes, thanks for calling
and not reversing the charges. Yes, bye.

14:12.695 --> 14:14.735
Shithead!

14:30.337 --> 14:32.663
President Skroob?

14:32.799 --> 14:33.998
Yes?

14:34.134 --> 14:37.503
This is Central Control.
Commanderette Zircon speaking, sir.

14:37.637 --> 14:39.048
What is it?

14:39.179 --> 14:42.763
Lord Helmet has just notified us
that Princess Vespa is in sight.

14:42.892 --> 14:46.178
- And Spaceball One is closing in on her.
- Good, good.

14:46.312 --> 14:50.262
We have both ships coming up
on the Teledar, sir, if you wish to observe.

14:50.399 --> 14:55.061
- I'll be down immediately.
- Shall I have Snotty beam you down, sir?

14:55.195 --> 14:58.066
I don't know about that
beaming stuff. Is it safe?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.816
Oh, yes, sir.
Snotty beamed me twice last night.

15:01.951 --> 15:04.359
It was wonderful.

15:04.496 --> 15:08.446
All right, I'll take a shot at it.
What the hell, it works on "Star Trek".

15:12.880 --> 15:14.707
Snotty!

15:14.839 --> 15:17.924
- Beam him down.
- Yes, sir. Immediately, sir.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.561
Great beasties! His head!

15:33.692 --> 15:37.855
- It's on backwards!
- Well, this is terrible! Do something!

15:37.987 --> 15:42.448
I'm sorry, sir. There must have been
a micro-converter malfunction.

15:43.701 --> 15:46.655
Why didn't somebody tell me
my ass was so big?

15:49.373 --> 15:52.458
Hold on, sir. We'll try to reverse the beam.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.826
Could be the interlocking system.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.046
Lock one. Lock two. Lock three.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.587
Loch Lomond.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.686
Are you all right, Mr President?

16:15.815 --> 16:17.854
Fine, fine, no thanks to you.

16:17.984 --> 16:22.030
- We'll beam you back, sir.
- Forget it, forget it. No more beaming.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.195
This time I'm gonna walk!

16:27.827 --> 16:30.116
President Skroob! Salute!

16:30.245 --> 16:32.653
Hail, Skroob!

16:33.874 --> 16:37.374
- Hello, President Skroob.
- Oh, uh...

16:37.504 --> 16:39.994
- Hello, Charlene.
- I'm Marlene!

16:40.131 --> 16:42.836
- Hello, Marlene.
- I'm Charlene!

16:42.967 --> 16:45.090
Chew your gum.

16:45.220 --> 16:47.793
- Where's the princess?
- Right there, sir.

16:47.930 --> 16:52.638
To the left, approaching Spaceball One
at 1500 light leagues per minute.

16:52.767 --> 16:55.438
Good, good! She's almost in our grasp.

16:55.562 --> 16:58.646
Tell Dark Helmet
he must take the princess alive.

17:05.821 --> 17:08.573
Princess Vespa's spaceship within range.

17:08.700 --> 17:13.279
Good.
Fire a warning shot across her nose.

17:15.748 --> 17:17.161
What's going on?

17:17.291 --> 17:21.207
It's either the Fourth of July,
or someone's trying to kill us!

17:24.089 --> 17:27.127
Hey, I don't have to put up with this.

17:27.259 --> 17:29.299
I'm rich.

17:29.846 --> 17:32.680
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling my father.

17:33.098 --> 17:36.136
1 - 800 - DRUIDIA.

17:38.981 --> 17:42.681
Careful, you idiot!
I said across her nose, not up it!

17:43.276 --> 17:45.564
Sorry, sir. Doing my best.

17:46.362 --> 17:48.983
- Who made that man a gunner?
- I did, sir.

17:49.115 --> 17:50.906
He's my cousin.

17:51.033 --> 17:53.274
- Who is he?
- He's an Asshole, sir.

17:53.411 --> 17:58.369
- I know that! What's his name?
- That is his name, sir. Major Asshole.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.330
- And his cousin?
- An Asshole, too. Gunner Phillip Asshole.

18:02.459 --> 18:05.082
How many Assholes
we got on this ship anyhow?

18:05.213 --> 18:07.253
Yo!

18:09.468 --> 18:11.959
I knew it. I'm surrounded by Assholes.

18:13.805 --> 18:16.095
Keep firing, Assholes!

18:17.977 --> 18:20.015
Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!

18:20.145 --> 18:22.434
There are laser blasts all around us!

18:22.563 --> 18:24.437
I'm scared.

18:25.483 --> 18:30.145
King Roland to Lone Starr!
King Roland to Lone Starr! Are you there?

18:30.447 --> 18:35.489
Lone Starr, you've got to help me. My
daughter's being attacked by Spaceballs.

18:35.618 --> 18:38.074
Spaceballs? Forget it. Too dangerous.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.988
Besides, I'm already numero uno
on Dark Helmet's hit list.

18:42.124 --> 18:45.161
Look, Your Highness,
it's not that we're afraid.

18:45.295 --> 18:48.995
It's just that we've got this thing
about death. It's not us.

18:49.131 --> 18:52.548
You're the only ones that can save her!
I'll give you anything!

18:52.677 --> 18:54.717
Did you hear me? Anything!

18:55.387 --> 18:57.794
- Anything?
- Yes, anything!

18:59.140 --> 19:03.637
- OK, we'll do it for... a million.
- A million!

19:03.772 --> 19:06.523
Oh, you're starting to fade,
Your Highness.

19:06.648 --> 19:09.518
All right, I'll pay it. Only find her, save her.

19:09.652 --> 19:12.023
All right, King. You just made a deal.

19:12.154 --> 19:14.609
One princess for one million space bucks.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.024
- What's she driving?
- A brand-new white Mercedes 2001

19:18.159 --> 19:21.694
SEL limited edition.
Moonroof, all-leather interior.

19:21.829 --> 19:24.072
I got it at a good price. I paid cash.

19:24.208 --> 19:27.541
My cousin Prince Murray has
a dealership. He was very nice to me.

19:27.669 --> 19:30.243
We get the idea.
Where was she last seen?

19:30.380 --> 19:33.583
- She was just passing Jupiter Two.
- We'll find her.

19:33.716 --> 19:35.756
Please, bring her back safely!

19:36.803 --> 19:40.218
And if it's at all possible,
try to save the car.

19:42.309 --> 19:45.178
One million space bucks!
We can pay off Pizza!

19:45.311 --> 19:46.936
Gimme paw!

19:53.903 --> 19:55.942
What's happening?

19:56.906 --> 19:59.148
What's that glow?

19:59.283 --> 20:02.404
- We're not moving.
- Oh, we're moving all right.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.576
Backwards!

20:09.001 --> 20:11.206
There's our princess. She's got company.

20:11.336 --> 20:15.381
Oh, no. Spaceballs. And they've
got her in their magnetic beam.

20:15.506 --> 20:18.543
Oh, well, we're too late.
I'll just reverse and we'll go.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.085
Barf! No. Bad.

20:21.221 --> 20:25.005
Why are we risking our lives
for a princess? I know we need money...

20:25.142 --> 20:28.225
Listen!
We're not just doing this for money.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.475
We're doing it for a shitload of money!

20:33.608 --> 20:36.525
Oh, you're right.
And when you're right, you're right.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.277
And you're always right.

20:38.405 --> 20:42.319
OK, we save her, but how?
They're gonna spot us on their radar.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.446
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.573
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.991
Uh-uh, not if we jam it.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.994
Aha! You're right.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.364
- Down scope!
- Down scope.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.549
Radar about to be

21:00.676 --> 21:02.087
jammed.

21:23.697 --> 21:26.105
Sh...

21:26.243 --> 21:27.867
..it!

21:33.375 --> 21:34.785
Sir?

21:34.918 --> 21:38.916
- What is it?
- Can I talk to you for a moment, sir?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.499
- Well?
- Trouble with the radar, sir

21:44.634 --> 21:46.960
You don't need that, Private. What is it?

21:47.096 --> 21:49.670
Trouble with the radar, sir

21:49.806 --> 21:51.966
- What is it?!
- Trouble with the radar.

21:52.101 --> 21:55.055
- What's wrong?
- I've lost the bleeps, sweeps and creeps.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.302
- The what?
- The what?

21:56.439 --> 21:58.478
You know. The bleeps:

22:01.110 --> 22:03.149
The sweeps:

22:04.737 --> 22:06.778
And the creeps:

22:07.991 --> 22:10.031
That's not all he's lost.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.913
Sir. The radar, sir. It appears to be

22:14.707 --> 22:16.534
jammed!

22:17.418 --> 22:19.456
Jammed.

22:22.631 --> 22:24.919
Raspberry.

22:25.676 --> 22:30.420
There is only one man
who would dare give me the raspberry.

22:31.515 --> 22:33.554
Lone Starr!

23:01.418 --> 23:05.202
- What was that?
- Never mind that. What was that?

23:07.257 --> 23:08.668
Hi.

23:08.801 --> 23:11.126
- Who are you?
- Barf.

23:11.261 --> 23:13.503
Not in here, mister. This is a Mercedes.

23:13.638 --> 23:15.844
No, that's my name. Barf.

23:15.974 --> 23:18.429
Barf? What are you?

23:18.559 --> 23:23.601
I'm a mog. Half man, half dog.
I'm my own best friend.

23:23.732 --> 23:25.143
What do you want?

23:25.276 --> 23:28.893
Your father hired Lone Starr and me
to save you. We gotta go.

23:29.028 --> 23:33.107
- Good. Quick. Hurry. Follow the dog.
- Mog. I'm a mog.

23:33.241 --> 23:35.482
Wait. What about my matched luggage?

23:41.166 --> 23:43.455
Hey, stop looking up my can.

23:43.584 --> 23:45.411
Sorry.

23:53.635 --> 23:55.462
Checking in?

23:55.596 --> 23:57.719
What the hell is all that?

23:59.684 --> 24:02.435
Her Royal Highness's matched luggage!

24:02.561 --> 24:04.185
What?

24:04.312 --> 24:06.685
Her Royal Highness's matched luggage.

24:07.192 --> 24:11.769
Oh, matched luggage, huh? What's
she think this is, a Princess Cruise?

24:12.488 --> 24:16.105
- Well, she wouldn't go without it.
- Oh, yeah?

24:19.661 --> 24:23.577
Now hear this! The minute we get
outta here the first thing we do is

24:23.707 --> 24:25.746
dump the matched luggage!

24:26.668 --> 24:28.707
Who was that?

24:29.088 --> 24:31.957
Now you hear this, whoever you are.

24:32.089 --> 24:34.546
You will not touch that luggage

24:34.675 --> 24:37.426
And, furthermore,
I want this pigsty cleaned up.

24:37.554 --> 24:40.804
I will not be rescued in such filth.

24:40.932 --> 24:44.301
Listen! On this ship,
I don't take orders, I give 'em.

24:44.436 --> 24:47.187
This is my dreamboat, sweetheart

24:47.313 --> 24:50.018
- Sweetheart?
- Uh-oh.

24:50.942 --> 24:53.267
How dare you speak to me that way!

24:53.401 --> 24:56.653
You will address me as
"Your Royal Highness"

24:56.781 --> 25:02.654
I am Princess Vespa.
Daughter of Roland, King of the Druids.

25:04.913 --> 25:06.953
That's all we needed.

25:07.081 --> 25:09.538
A Druish princess.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.335
Funny, she doesn't look Druish.

25:51.208 --> 25:55.336
Now we will show her
who is in charge of this galaxy.

25:55.672 --> 25:57.083
Hold it!

25:57.214 --> 25:59.670
I'll handle this personally.

26:00.802 --> 26:02.841
Jawohl, Lord Helmet.

26:05.972 --> 26:08.049
So, Princess Vespa,

26:08.184 --> 26:11.849
you thought you could outwit
the forces of Planet Spaceball.

26:12.563 --> 26:14.638
Well, you were wrong.

26:14.774 --> 26:19.518
You are now our prisoner. And you
will be held hostage until such time

26:19.652 --> 26:23.353
as all of the air is transferred
from your planet

26:23.489 --> 26:25.529
to ours.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.075
She's not in there!

26:36.919 --> 26:41.462
Radar repaired, sir. We're
picking up the outline of a Winnebago

26:41.591 --> 26:43.418
Winnebago?

26:43.551 --> 26:45.591
Lone Starr.

26:46.595 --> 26:48.636
Lone Starr...

26:53.770 --> 26:58.430
- Uh-oh, here comes the Badyear blimp.
- We'd better get outta here in a hurry.

26:58.565 --> 27:02.148
- Switch to secret hyper jets.
- Switching to secret hyper jets.

27:02.277 --> 27:05.978
Buckle up back there,
we're going into... hyperactive.

27:13.372 --> 27:16.822
We're closing in on them, sir.
Soon Lone Starr will be ours.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.579
Good. Prepare to attack.

27:19.711 --> 27:21.122
Prepare to attack!

27:21.254 --> 27:23.663
On the count of three.

27:23.799 --> 27:25.459
One

27:25.592 --> 27:27.502
two

27:27.636 --> 27:30.209
late! What happened? Where are they?

27:30.346 --> 27:32.754
I don't know, sir.
They must have hyper jets.

27:32.891 --> 27:35.926
- And what have we got? A Cuisinart?
- No, sir.

27:36.059 --> 27:38.302
- Well, find them! Catch them!
- Yes, sir!

27:38.438 --> 27:41.807
- Prepare ship for light speed.
- No, no, light speed is too slow.

27:41.941 --> 27:45.191
- Light speed too slow?
- Yes. We're gonna have to go right to

27:45.320 --> 27:48.237
- ludicrous speed.
- Ludicrous speed?

27:48.364 --> 27:51.401
We've never gone that fast.
Maybe the ship can't take it.

27:51.533 --> 27:54.819
What's the matter, Colonel Sandurz?
Chicken?

27:56.413 --> 27:58.703
Prepare ship...

27:58.833 --> 28:01.619
Prepare ship for ludicrous speed.

28:01.752 --> 28:04.873
Fasten all seat belts.
Seal all entrances and exits.

28:05.005 --> 28:08.587
Close all shops in the mall.
Cancel the three-ring circus.

28:08.717 --> 28:13.379
- Secure all animals in the zoo...
- Shut up, you petty excuse for an officer!

28:14.265 --> 28:17.467
Now hear this. Ludicrous speed!

28:17.601 --> 28:20.472
- Sir, hadn't you better buckle up?
- Oh, buckle this!

28:20.604 --> 28:23.274
Ludicrous speed! Go!

28:46.337 --> 28:48.910
What have I done?

28:50.174 --> 28:54.504
My brains... are going into my feet.

29:05.897 --> 29:08.139
What the hell was that?

29:08.692 --> 29:10.731
Spaceball One.

29:11.444 --> 29:13.686
They've gone to plaid!

29:15.532 --> 29:19.031
We passed them! Stop this thing!

29:19.537 --> 29:22.157
We can't stop. It's too dangerous.

29:22.288 --> 29:24.411
We've got to slow down first.

29:25.209 --> 29:26.619
Bullshit!

29:26.752 --> 29:30.085
Just stop this thing! I order you!

29:30.213 --> 29:33.048
Stop!

29:48.022 --> 29:50.478
Here, sir, here. Let me help you, sir.

29:52.527 --> 29:55.860
- Are you all right, sir?
- Fine. How have you been?

29:55.989 --> 29:57.612
- Fine, sir.
- Good.

29:57.741 --> 30:00.195
- Good thing you were wearing a helmet.
- Yeah.

30:00.325 --> 30:02.365
What shall we do now, sir?

30:02.494 --> 30:05.531
- Well... Are we stopped?
- We're stopped, sir.

30:05.663 --> 30:07.704
Good.

30:07.833 --> 30:11.452
- Why don't we take a five-minute break?
- Very good, sir.

30:12.087 --> 30:14.126
Smoke if you got 'em.

30:17.091 --> 30:21.090
- Take her out of hyperactive.
- Takin' her out of hyperactive.

30:23.348 --> 30:26.931
Congrats, boss. We did it.
They must've overshot us by a week.

30:27.059 --> 30:30.976
- OK. Set a course for Druidia.
- Setting a course for Drui-i-i-i...

30:31.106 --> 30:33.644
- What's that?
- I don't know. We're losin' power.

30:33.775 --> 30:35.813
We're out of gas!

30:35.943 --> 30:39.526
- Must have burned it up in hyper.
- Should've put more than $5 worth in!

30:39.655 --> 30:43.404
OK, we'll have to set her down.
Prepare for an emergency landing.

30:43.533 --> 30:47.199
- Quick, give me a reading.
- "Our Father, who art in heaven..."

30:47.329 --> 30:48.954
Stop that!

30:49.206 --> 30:51.912
Keep your seat belts on.
You OK, Princess?

30:54.377 --> 30:57.415
No, you idiot!
Where'd you learn how to fly?

30:57.547 --> 30:59.872
OK, Eagle Five coming in.

31:21.237 --> 31:24.108
Go left. Right! I mean right! Whoa!

31:35.919 --> 31:40.165
- Where are you going?
- I am going to tell him off once and for all.

31:40.924 --> 31:44.007
W-w-w-wait!
We'll need him to get us out of here.

31:44.135 --> 31:48.796
Called me an idiot? I'm goin' back there
and explain a few things to her.

31:48.931 --> 31:52.631
Besides, he's got a sexy voice.
He might be cute.

31:53.519 --> 31:57.683
- You haven't seen what she looks like.
- I have. All princesses look the same.

31:57.815 --> 32:01.149
Cute! I know these space bums.
They're all alike.

32:01.276 --> 32:04.028
- Fat, ugly,
- Bucktoothed, knock-kneed,

32:04.155 --> 32:07.357
- beer-swilling pigs.
- horse-faced space dogs.

32:07.491 --> 32:10.575
Normally I'd...
Ooh! That's gonna leave a mark.

32:11.203 --> 32:12.911
Now, listen, you...

32:14.706 --> 32:19.914
You listen. On this ship you're to refer
to me as "idiot", not "you Captain".

32:20.045 --> 32:23.628
- I mean... You know what I mean.
- And you will not call me "you".

32:23.842 --> 32:26.247
You will never address me as "you".

32:26.384 --> 32:29.006
You will call me "Your Royal Highness"!

32:29.137 --> 32:31.592
You are a royal pain in the...

32:31.723 --> 32:33.762
- Whoa! Hold it. Time.
- What?

32:33.892 --> 32:38.055
May I make a suggestion? Any minute
the Spaceballs will make a U-turn,

32:38.188 --> 32:40.477
head back this way and make us all dead.

32:40.606 --> 32:42.433
He's right. Let's go.

32:42.567 --> 32:44.641
Wait. My things.

32:44.777 --> 32:47.350
Now, listen, you royal...

32:47.488 --> 32:48.899
..Highness.

32:49.032 --> 32:52.566
Take only what you need to survive.

33:13.055 --> 33:17.182
Please, slow down.
I'm getting sand up my gears.

33:19.936 --> 33:22.807
Gee, I hope she didn't forget anything.

33:27.653 --> 33:31.816
All right, wait a minute, Barf. Put it down.

33:32.239 --> 33:34.696
- What the hell's in this thing?
- I dunno.

33:38.871 --> 33:43.117
What's this?
I said take only what you need to survive.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.999
It's my industrial-strength hair dryer.

33:46.128 --> 33:48.536
And I can't live without it!

33:49.800 --> 33:54.260
OK, Princess, that's it.
The fairy tale is over.

33:54.553 --> 33:56.795
Welcome to real life.

33:56.931 --> 34:00.845
You want this hot-air machine,
you carry it.

34:01.143 --> 34:02.970
You pick that up.

34:03.812 --> 34:05.936
You pick that up.

34:06.064 --> 34:09.268
How dare you, you insolent peasant!

34:09.400 --> 34:12.485
Nobody talks to me that way. Nobody!

34:12.612 --> 34:14.237
Nobody!

34:14.364 --> 34:17.449
Well, what have we got here?
Will you look at her?

34:17.951 --> 34:21.699
Those flashing eyes, those
flushed cheeks, those trembling lips.

34:21.830 --> 34:24.071
You know something, Princess?

34:24.206 --> 34:26.661
You are ugly when you're angry.

34:26.793 --> 34:28.916
- Uh-oh.
- That's it.

34:29.045 --> 34:32.248
- You and your dog are...
- Please, please,

34:32.382 --> 34:34.670
total humans, droids, if I may.

34:34.801 --> 34:38.051
It'll be dark soon,
so I suggest we find a place to camp.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.217
Come, darling.

34:46.020 --> 34:50.433
- See? It's lighter.
- Oh, yeah. This is the best.

34:51.775 --> 34:54.445
I could have carried two or three of these.

34:56.364 --> 34:58.403
Have you found them yet?

34:58.532 --> 35:01.155
No, Lord Helmet.
They're still not on the scanner.

35:01.285 --> 35:03.325
Well, keep looking for them.

35:12.546 --> 35:14.788
Pardon me, sir. I have an idea.

35:15.090 --> 35:18.838
Corporal, get me the video cassette
of "Spaceballs: The Movie".

35:18.968 --> 35:21.008
Yes, sir.

35:23.391 --> 35:26.724
"The Producers", "Blazing Saddles",
"Young Frankenstein"...

35:26.936 --> 35:30.553
- Colonel Sandurz, may I speak with you?
- Yes, sir.

35:30.689 --> 35:34.188
How can there be a cassette
of the movie? We're still making it!

35:34.317 --> 35:37.936
True, sir. But there's been a breakthrough
in home-video marketing.

35:38.071 --> 35:40.692
- There has?
- Yes. Instant cassettes.

35:40.824 --> 35:43.991
They're out in stores
before the movie is finished.

35:44.118 --> 35:46.325
- Nah!
- Here it is, sir.

35:46.996 --> 35:50.578
- "Spaceballs".
- Good work, Corporal. Punch it up.

35:54.838 --> 35:57.921
- Prepare to fast-forward.
- Preparing to fast-forward.

35:58.049 --> 36:00.505
- Fast-forward!
- Fast-forwarding, sir.

36:18.985 --> 36:23.862
No, no, no, go past this. Past this part.
In fact, never play this again.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.991
Try here. Stop.

36:39.589 --> 36:42.874
What the hell am I looking at?
When does this happen in the movie?

36:43.009 --> 36:47.469
Now. You're looking at now. Everything
that happens now is happening now.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.221
- And then?
- We passed then.

36:49.348 --> 36:51.591
- When?
- Just now. We're at now, now.

36:51.726 --> 36:52.970
- Go back to then.
- When?

36:53.102 --> 36:53.884
- Now.
- Now?

36:54.021 --> 36:55.480
- Now!
- I can't. We missed it.

36:55.605 --> 36:57.479
- When?
- Just now.

36:57.607 --> 37:00.524
- When will then be now?
- Soon.

37:01.443 --> 37:04.481
- How soon?
- Sir, we've identified their location.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.072
- Where?
- The moon of Vega.

37:06.198 --> 37:08.439
- Prepare for our arrival.
- When?

37:08.575 --> 37:11.445
- 1900 hours.
- By tomorrow they'll be our prisoners.

37:11.579 --> 37:13.618
Who?!

37:30.847 --> 37:34.892
- No, thank you. I'm perfectly all right.
- Take it. It's freezing.

37:35.018 --> 37:37.057
If you insist.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.811
- Won't you be cold?
- Nah, cold never bothers me.

37:53.328 --> 37:56.114
I can't seem to find Druidia.

37:56.246 --> 37:57.871
It's right there.

37:57.999 --> 38:02.211
- Where?
- There. It's that bright blue one. See?

38:03.672 --> 38:06.541
Oh, yeah, but it's so far a...

38:07.258 --> 38:09.167
..away.

38:09.385 --> 38:11.626
Don't worry. I'll get you there.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.968
- Which one's yours?
- Who knows?

38:15.097 --> 38:19.225
- You don't know where you're from?
- No. I was found outside a monastery.

38:19.352 --> 38:23.267
- Monastery? Where?
- Somewhere in the Ford Galaxy.

38:23.982 --> 38:26.437
Didn't the monks say
who your parents were?

38:26.568 --> 38:29.320
They couldn't. They took a vow of silence.

38:29.445 --> 38:32.115
All I got was this. It was around my neck.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.864
- What is it?
- I don't know.

38:33.991 --> 38:38.737
I've taken it to every wise man in the
universe. Nobody can tell me what it says.

38:39.998 --> 38:42.240
It's beautiful.

38:42.875 --> 38:44.500
You know, I...

38:47.256 --> 38:49.294
It's beautiful.

38:53.303 --> 38:56.054
So, how come you ran away
from your wedding?

38:57.181 --> 39:01.427
Well, if you must know,
I wasn't in love with the groom.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.431
- Why were you gonna marry him?
- Because!

39:04.564 --> 39:07.849
I'm a princess
and I have to marry a prince.

39:07.984 --> 39:11.932
Ah! And he doesn't do it for you, huh?

39:12.070 --> 39:15.071
No, he doesn't do it for me.

39:19.161 --> 39:21.201
I really must go back.

39:22.372 --> 39:24.780
I shouldn't have run away.

39:25.167 --> 39:30.790
I realise now that love
is one luxury a princess cannot afford.

39:30.922 --> 39:33.045
You're probably right.

39:33.175 --> 39:37.007
I know now that I must learn to live
without... love.

39:37.137 --> 39:38.761
I guess so.

39:38.889 --> 39:42.757
- Besides, love isn't that important.
- Nah, it never was.

39:42.893 --> 39:46.307
I could be perfectly happy
the rest of my life without...

39:47.688 --> 39:49.312
..love.

39:49.439 --> 39:51.517
Sure you could.

39:52.776 --> 39:55.065
Without physical contact.

39:55.989 --> 39:57.531
Yeah.

39:57.698 --> 40:00.070
Without being held.

40:00.201 --> 40:02.028
Yeah.

40:02.955 --> 40:05.194
Or kissed.

40:11.837 --> 40:13.876
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

40:14.007 --> 40:16.248
Women and mogs first!

40:16.966 --> 40:19.126
We'll have none of that, mister.

40:19.262 --> 40:22.712
- How far did he get? What'd he touch?
- Nothing happened.

40:22.847 --> 40:26.050
- What the hell was that noise?
- That was my virgin alarm.

40:26.183 --> 40:28.971
It's programmed to go off before you do.

40:29.103 --> 40:32.389
You get back to bed, miss.
And as for you, sex fiend...

40:32.524 --> 40:37.020
All right, let's all just get some sleep.
We gotta get moving before dawn.

40:37.153 --> 40:40.025
- Why so early?
- Because we're in the middle of a desert,

40:40.156 --> 40:44.532
and we aren't gonna get very far
once that blazing sun gets overhead.

40:48.915 --> 40:50.908
Nice dissolve.

41:00.134 --> 41:02.173
Water. Water.

41:03.053 --> 41:04.879
Water.

41:12.939 --> 41:14.978
Oil. Oil.

41:16.734 --> 41:19.818
Room service. Room service.

41:25.158 --> 41:27.400
Chief, that's it.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.910
I can't... I can't go any further.

41:33.709 --> 41:36.910
- I can't go any further.
- Come on, Barf, old buddy.

41:37.045 --> 41:39.084
- No!
- Just one more dune to go.

41:39.213 --> 41:42.049
No! You said that three dunes ago.

41:43.009 --> 41:45.048
I got no more left.

41:46.179 --> 41:48.468
Oh, waiter. Check, please.

41:51.267 --> 41:53.142
Must go on.

41:53.269 --> 41:55.307
Must go on!

41:56.147 --> 41:58.186
Must go on...

41:59.191 --> 42:01.018
Who am I kidding?

43:01.502 --> 43:03.542
Oh. Thanks, little guy.

43:05.298 --> 43:07.456
Oh, thank you.

43:09.634 --> 43:11.794
Did I miss something?

43:11.928 --> 43:14.170
When did we get to Disneyland?

43:31.990 --> 43:36.402
- I don't see them, Sandurz.
- I've sent the troops on ahead, sir.

43:36.537 --> 43:39.407
- Good. Get moving.
- Driver, prepare to move out.

43:39.540 --> 43:41.946
What are you preparing? Just go!

43:42.083 --> 43:43.282
- Just go.
- Yes, sir.

43:43.419 --> 43:45.457
Sir, shouldn't you sit down?

44:04.271 --> 44:08.019
- What are they saying?
- They want us to go with them.

44:17.868 --> 44:22.079
- What is this place?
- It looks like the Temple of Doom.

44:22.205 --> 44:24.364
Well, it ain't Temple Beth Israel.

44:24.707 --> 44:27.626
Come on. I think we better follow 'em.

44:39.390 --> 44:41.629
Oh-oh, I think we woke it up.

44:42.599 --> 44:45.804
- Goodbye. Let me know how it turns out.
- Come back, Dot!

44:45.937 --> 44:49.056
- Come on, we gotta keep goin'.
- We need you.

44:55.071 --> 44:58.605
- What's gonna happen now?
- Don't ask. Maybe it won't.

44:58.740 --> 45:02.026
- What if it does? I'm all for leaving!
- Barf, no!

45:02.162 --> 45:05.363
I think we get outta here now
while the going's good!

45:06.290 --> 45:08.117
Silence!

45:08.251 --> 45:13.874
Who dares enter the sacred and awesome
presence of the everlasting know-it-all,

45:14.006 --> 45:16.046
Yogurt?

45:16.425 --> 45:18.251
Yogurt?

45:27.685 --> 45:32.147
- You heard of me?
- Heard of you? Who hasn't heard of you?

45:32.274 --> 45:34.101
Yogurt, the wise.

45:34.234 --> 45:37.400
- Yogurt, the all-powerful!
- Yogurt, the magnificent.

45:37.862 --> 45:41.990
Please, please, don't make a fuss.
I'm just plain Yogurt.

45:42.115 --> 45:44.156
- But you're the one...
- Yes!

45:44.285 --> 45:47.406
I am the keeper of a greater magic.

45:47.538 --> 45:50.161
A power known throughout the universe

45:50.292 --> 45:51.703
- as the...
- Force?

45:51.834 --> 45:54.407
No. The Schwartz.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.834
The Schwartz.

45:57.005 --> 45:58.749
Yes.

45:58.882 --> 46:00.709
The Schwartz.

46:04.096 --> 46:08.308
But, Yogurt, what is this place?
What is it that you do here?

46:08.434 --> 46:12.017
- Merchandising.
- Merchandising. What's that?

46:12.146 --> 46:14.517
Merchandising. Come, I'll show you.

46:14.648 --> 46:16.272
Open up the store.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.901
Come! Walk this way! Take a look.

46:24.032 --> 46:27.567
We put the picture's name on everything!

46:27.703 --> 46:30.372
Merchandising! Merchandising!

46:30.497 --> 46:33.166
Where the real money
from the movie is made.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.992
"Spaceballs" - the T-shirt.
"Spaceballs" - the colouring book.

46:37.128 --> 46:41.506
"Spaceballs" - the lunchbox.
"Spaceballs" - the breakfast cereal.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.673
"Spaceballs" - the flame thrower!

46:44.760 --> 46:46.967
The kids love this one.

46:47.098 --> 46:50.631
Last, but not least. "Spaceballs" - the doll.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.641
Me.

46:52.769 --> 46:54.926
May the Schwartz be with you

46:57.648 --> 46:59.474
Adorable.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.704
- President Skroob.
- What is it?

47:16.834 --> 47:20.417
I have an urgent message from
Lord Helmet. He's lost the princess.

47:20.546 --> 47:22.835
- Where?
- Somewhere in the sands of Vega.

47:22.965 --> 47:26.712
Tell them to comb the desert,
do you hear me? Comb the desert!

47:26.843 --> 47:28.882
Yes, sir.

47:33.933 --> 47:35.973
- Sir?
- What?

47:37.479 --> 47:40.978
- Are we being too literal?
- No, you fool, we're following orders

47:41.108 --> 47:44.392
We were told to comb the desert,
so we're combing it

47:44.819 --> 47:47.143
Found anything yet?

47:47.279 --> 47:49.319
Nothing yet, sir.

47:50.909 --> 47:53.281
How about you?

47:53.412 --> 47:55.451
Not a thing, sir.

47:58.082 --> 48:00.158
What about you guys?

48:00.292 --> 48:02.332
We ain't found shit!

48:05.423 --> 48:09.088
It's a big mystery. None of the wise men
could tell me what it means.

48:09.218 --> 48:13.429
Wise men, pshaw. Wise guys, you mean.
What do they know?

48:13.555 --> 48:15.595
Here, let me take a look.

48:24.650 --> 48:27.935
- You can read it!
- No, I was just clearing my throat.

48:28.069 --> 48:30.109
Here, let me take a...

48:30.863 --> 48:33.402
Ah. Ooh, yes.

48:33.534 --> 48:35.859
Yes, yes, of course!

48:35.994 --> 48:37.619
- You understand it?
- Yes.

48:37.746 --> 48:40.414
- What's it say?
- I cannot tell you that now.

48:40.540 --> 48:45.285
- It'll be revealed to you at the proper time.
- Great.

48:45.420 --> 48:48.670
Don't be disappointed.
Back to your Schwartz training.

48:48.799 --> 48:52.381
Here, take the ring.
Point it at that big statue.

48:52.509 --> 48:57.552
OK, but I still don't understand how I'm
gonna lift a big statue with this little ring.

48:57.681 --> 49:02.058
Never underestimate
the power of the Schwartz!

49:02.186 --> 49:04.891
Come on, concentrate. Here we go.

49:06.356 --> 49:08.017
Concentrate.

49:21.037 --> 49:23.707
Lone Starr, you're doing it!

49:23.832 --> 49:25.457
You're doing it!

49:26.334 --> 49:28.742
I can't believe it. The Schwartz is working!

49:28.880 --> 49:30.504
Yes! Yes!

49:30.631 --> 49:32.837
Hey, boss, how'd you do that?

49:37.511 --> 49:40.086
Give me the ring. Give me the ring, quick!

49:41.015 --> 49:45.013
Upsee-dahzee, upsee-mahzee,
upsy-daisy!

49:51.151 --> 49:53.189
Sorry, Barf.

49:58.324 --> 50:00.363
Keep searching.

50:01.870 --> 50:07.029
- It's no use. We've searched everywhere.
- Wait. I feel the presence of

50:07.166 --> 50:08.578
the Schwartz!

50:08.709 --> 50:10.583
- The Schwartz?
- Yes.

50:10.711 --> 50:14.791
It's coming from somewhere... down

50:14.924 --> 50:16.750
there!

50:18.470 --> 50:21.553
You're right, sir.
There's a secret entrance here.

50:21.679 --> 50:24.634
And look at this insignia. It's a "Y".

50:25.559 --> 50:27.931
Yogurt! Yogurt!

50:28.062 --> 50:31.726
I hate yogurt! Even with strawberries.

50:31.857 --> 50:34.775
- I'll call for the attack squad.
- No, we can't go in.

50:34.901 --> 50:37.570
Yogurt has the Schwartz.
It's too powerful.

50:37.696 --> 50:40.269
But, sir, don't you have the Schwartz, too?

50:40.407 --> 50:43.990
He got the upside, I got the downside.
Each Schwartz has two sides.

50:44.119 --> 50:46.870
Then how are we gonna go in there
and get her?

50:48.330 --> 50:50.786
We will not go in there.

50:50.916 --> 50:54.201
She will come out to us.

51:05.473 --> 51:09.387
Vespa, Vespa, my child

51:09.517 --> 51:11.345
Where are you?

51:11.478 --> 51:12.889
Daddy?

51:13.021 --> 51:17.067
Vespa, it's your father, King Roland

51:17.193 --> 51:20.311
- Come to me
- Daddy?

51:20.446 --> 51:23.364
I hear you. I hear you. Where are you?

51:23.490 --> 51:25.530
Follow my voice

51:26.743 --> 51:28.867
Come to me

51:29.579 --> 51:31.619
Come to me

51:33.959 --> 51:35.668
Vespa, where are you going?

51:35.794 --> 51:38.795
Vespa, come to me.

51:42.842 --> 51:45.677
Daddy! Is it really you?

51:45.804 --> 51:49.752
Yes, my dear. I guarantee it.

51:50.433 --> 51:52.473
Would I lie?

51:54.520 --> 51:55.719
Daddy!

51:56.773 --> 51:58.599
No, Vespa, don't!

51:59.817 --> 52:01.228
No.

52:01.902 --> 52:03.941
Fooled you.

52:06.991 --> 52:11.154
Take them both aboard
and put the princess in my quarters.

52:11.287 --> 52:13.326
Now she is mine.

52:13.956 --> 52:17.241
- What are they saying?
- They've taken the princess!

52:26.718 --> 52:28.545
Spaceballs. Too late.

52:28.887 --> 52:31.343
Don't worry, boss. We'll get her back.

52:31.973 --> 52:33.800
Yeah.

52:35.102 --> 52:37.592
- Thanks for the gas, Yogurt.
- You're welcome.

52:37.729 --> 52:41.227
And here. Just in case you get hungry.

52:42.066 --> 52:43.893
- A fortune cookie?
- Yes.

52:44.027 --> 52:47.976
Remember: open it before you eat it.

52:48.114 --> 52:50.439
Thanks. Well, we better get going.

52:50.574 --> 52:53.197
I wonder...
Will we ever see each other again?

52:53.327 --> 52:57.407
Who knows? God willing,
we'll all meet again in "Spaceballs Il:

52:57.539 --> 52:59.578
The Search for More Money".

53:00.376 --> 53:03.246
- Goodbye, Lone Starr.
- Goodbye, Yogurt.

53:04.588 --> 53:06.961
The ring of the Schwartz!

53:07.090 --> 53:10.460
- No, no, I can't take this.
- Take it, take it.

53:10.760 --> 53:14.094
- You might need it.
- Thanks.

53:14.222 --> 53:16.261
I'll never forget you.

53:17.268 --> 53:19.094
Wish me luck.

53:41.750 --> 53:47.170
So, Princess Vespa,
at last I have you in my clutches

53:47.297 --> 53:51.081
to have my way with you
the way I want to.

53:51.217 --> 53:55.261
No! No! Please, leave me alone.
No, you are mine.

53:55.388 --> 53:58.258
Not so fast, Helmet. Lone Starr!

53:58.390 --> 54:02.139
Yes, it's me.
I'm here to save my girlfriend. Hi, honey.

54:02.270 --> 54:04.642
Now you are going to die. Psst!

54:04.771 --> 54:07.014
Oh, oh! Oh!

54:07.149 --> 54:11.811
What'd you do to him? The same thing
I'm going to do to you, big boy. Oh!

54:11.945 --> 54:14.105
And you, too. Oh! Argh!

54:14.239 --> 54:18.189
Now, Princess Vespa, at last we are alone.

54:18.327 --> 54:21.162
Oh, no, I hate you. Leave me alone.

54:21.289 --> 54:25.535
Yet I find you strangely attractive.
Of course you do.

54:25.668 --> 54:29.616
Druish princesses are often
attracted to money and power.

54:29.754 --> 54:32.708
And I have both. And you know it.

54:32.841 --> 54:36.886
Oh, leave me alone. No, kiss me!
No! No! Yes! No!

54:37.011 --> 54:39.051
No! Yes! No! Yes!

54:42.474 --> 54:45.727
Oh, your helmet is so big.

54:46.271 --> 54:47.894
- Lord Helmet.
- What?

54:48.022 --> 54:51.639
- You're needed on the bridge, sir.
- Knock on my door! Knock next time!

54:51.776 --> 54:53.815
- Yes, sir.
- Did you see anything?

54:53.945 --> 54:56.270
No, I didn't see you
playing with your dolls.

54:56.405 --> 54:58.233
Good.

55:16.384 --> 55:18.009
President Skroob.

55:18.135 --> 55:21.884
I told you never to call me on this wall!
This is an unlisted wall.

55:22.014 --> 55:26.093
Sorry, sir, but it's very important.
The princess is in your office

55:26.225 --> 55:28.551
and Lord Helmet is awaiting you there.

55:28.686 --> 55:32.685
- All right, all right. I'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.

55:44.369 --> 55:48.746
Helmet, you fiend! What's going on?
What are you doing to my daughter?

55:48.872 --> 55:52.622
Permit me to introduce
the brilliant young plastic surgeon,

55:52.752 --> 55:54.580
Dr Phillip Schlotkin.

55:54.712 --> 55:59.588
The greatest nose-job man
in the entire universe and Beverly Hills.

55:59.717 --> 56:03.132
- Your Highness.
- Nose job? She's already had a nose job.

56:03.262 --> 56:05.301
It was her Sweet-16 present.

56:05.431 --> 56:09.013
No, it's not what you think.
It's much, much worse.

56:09.142 --> 56:12.725
If you do not give me
the combination to the air shield,

56:12.855 --> 56:15.773
Dr Schlotkin will give your daughter back

56:15.900 --> 56:18.057
her old nose!

56:18.193 --> 56:21.278
No!

56:22.697 --> 56:26.861
- Where did you get that?
- All right, I'll tell. I'll tell.

56:26.993 --> 56:30.612
- No, Daddy, no! You mustn't.
- You're right, my dear.

56:30.747 --> 56:35.042
I'll miss your new nose, but I will not
tell him the combination, no matter what.

56:35.586 --> 56:39.452
Very well. Dr Schlotkin, do your worst.

56:39.589 --> 56:41.628
My pleasure.

56:44.636 --> 56:46.676
No! Wait! Wait!

56:47.389 --> 56:49.963
I'll tell. I'll tell.

56:50.391 --> 56:52.515
I knew it would work.

56:52.644 --> 56:54.885
All right. Give it to me.

56:56.021 --> 56:58.062
The combination is

56:59.650 --> 57:00.432
one.

57:00.568 --> 57:01.896
- One.
- One.

57:02.028 --> 57:02.858
Two.

57:02.987 --> 57:04.101
- Two.
- Two.

57:04.238 --> 57:04.937
Three.

57:05.072 --> 57:06.187
- Three.
- Three.

57:06.324 --> 57:07.023
Four.

57:07.158 --> 57:08.439
- Four.
- Four.

57:09.618 --> 57:10.401
Five.

57:10.536 --> 57:11.995
- Five.
- Five.

57:12.581 --> 57:17.455
So the combination is
one, two, three, four, five.

57:18.086 --> 57:20.920
That's the stupidest combination
I ever heard!

57:21.047 --> 57:23.288
It's what an idiot has on his luggage.

57:23.424 --> 57:25.296
Thank you, Your Highness.

57:25.675 --> 57:28.213
- What did you do?
- I turned off the wall.

57:28.346 --> 57:30.754
- No, you turned off the movie.
- Wrong button.

57:30.889 --> 57:33.261
- Well, put it back up!
- Yes, sir!

57:33.892 --> 57:37.760
You gotta get that thing fixed! We're back,
and we have the combination.

57:37.896 --> 57:39.936
- Schlotkin!
- What?

57:40.065 --> 57:43.399
We're done. Go back to the golf course
and work on your putts.

57:43.859 --> 57:48.737
Let's go, Arnold. Come, Gretchen.
Of course I'll still have to bill you for this.

57:52.117 --> 57:54.989
Oh! I bet she gives great helmet.

57:57.916 --> 58:01.117
- Did it work?
- Yes, sir. We have the combination.

58:01.252 --> 58:06.079
Great! Now we can take every last breath
of fresh air from Planet Druidia.

58:06.215 --> 58:09.299
- What's the combination?
- One, two, three, four, five.

58:09.426 --> 58:11.466
- One, two, three, four, five?
- Yes.

58:11.594 --> 58:15.344
That's amazing. I've got
the same combination on my luggage.

58:15.473 --> 58:19.258
- Prepare Spaceball One for departure.
- Yes, sir.

58:19.395 --> 58:22.065
And change the combination
on my luggage.

58:28.861 --> 58:31.779
There it is. Spaceball City straight ahead.

58:31.906 --> 58:33.946
Good. I'm taking her in.

58:36.912 --> 58:39.154
What the hell is that thing?

58:39.581 --> 58:42.535
Looks like a Winnebago with wings. Jeez.

58:42.667 --> 58:45.206
Hey, you can't park here!

58:45.337 --> 58:48.338
Yeah. Can't you guys read? "No Parking".

58:52.969 --> 58:55.008
That son of a...

58:58.015 --> 59:02.393
All right, hands up.
You're under arrest for illegal parking.

59:02.520 --> 59:04.346
Yeah!

59:26.626 --> 59:31.204
Warden Miller, Warden Miller
You're wanted in V17

59:31.339 --> 59:36.085
Attention, attention
Section C scanners, report

59:36.887 --> 59:38.298
Nah.

59:42.308 --> 59:46.056
- She's gotta be in one of these cells.
- Yeah, but which one?

59:47.729 --> 59:49.272
- No.
- No.

59:52.569 --> 59:55.024
- It's coming from here.
- That can't be her.

01:00:05.039 --> 01:00:06.865
It's her!

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.838
She's a bass!

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.270
- What do you want?
- It's me!

01:00:29.187 --> 01:00:31.761
- It's us!
- Lone Starr!

01:00:31.898 --> 01:00:35.267
- How did you find us?
- No time to talk. Come on.

01:00:35.402 --> 01:00:37.893
- We gotta move.
- Barf, how'd you do it?

01:00:40.615 --> 01:00:42.654
Come on.

01:00:58.507 --> 01:01:01.711
Hey, those are the guys
that stole our uniforms!

01:01:01.844 --> 01:01:04.086
And beat the shit out of us, too!

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.849
Uh-oh, we got company!

01:01:15.398 --> 01:01:17.190
Watch out!

01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:21.693
Dammit! That's our only way out.

01:01:21.821 --> 01:01:24.064
- We're trapped!
- I hate these movies.

01:01:27.035 --> 01:01:30.619
- Oh. I'm out of ammo!
- Get back! I'll hold 'em off!

01:01:32.373 --> 01:01:34.200
I got an idea!

01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:36.540
- What are you doing?
- What's he doing?

01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:52.635
Good work.
Uh-oh, more ping pongs! Run for it.

01:01:52.768 --> 01:01:54.845
Let's go!

01:01:58.064 --> 01:02:00.105
It's closing!

01:02:01.569 --> 01:02:04.772
- The door's closing!
- Go for broke!

01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:15.577
Don't move, or you're dead. Stand up!

01:02:15.916 --> 01:02:17.956
Captain, we've got them.

01:02:21.672 --> 01:02:24.508
Spectacular stunt, my friends.

01:02:24.634 --> 01:02:26.672
But all for naught.

01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:28.841
Turn around, please.

01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:31.260
Ah, what a pity.

01:02:31.556 --> 01:02:33.597
What a pity.

01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:38.263
So, Princess, you thought you could
outwit the imperious force of...

01:02:41.483 --> 01:02:44.649
You idiots! These are not them!

01:02:44.778 --> 01:02:47.446
You've captured their stunt doubles!

01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:51.155
Search the area. Find them!

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:53.441
Find them!

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:02.332
- Open the door!
- I can't. It's fused.

01:03:02.462 --> 01:03:04.169
- And this one?
- It's locked.

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:06.004
- The keys?
- Inside.

01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:08.374
- Oh, great!
- Duck!

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:15.846
- Here, you hold 'em off. I'll get the door.
- I'm not shooting this thing. I hate guns.

01:03:18.477 --> 01:03:21.348
My hair! He shot my hair.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.562
Son of a bitch!

01:03:35.118 --> 01:03:37.157
Holy shit!

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:44.833
- How was that?
- Not bad.

01:03:44.961 --> 01:03:48.661
- Not bad... for a girl.
- Hey, that was pretty good for Rambo.

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:50.957
Let's blow this joint.

01:04:02.478 --> 01:04:04.636
President Skroob!

01:04:04.772 --> 01:04:07.441
- Salute!
- Hail, Skroob!

01:04:09.027 --> 01:04:11.778
The ship is too big.
If I walk, the movie'll be over.

01:04:11.904 --> 01:04:14.193
- Sir.
- Yes? Ooh!

01:04:14.323 --> 01:04:17.240
Never have that damn thing down
in front of me!

01:04:17.366 --> 01:04:20.239
How do I know you're not
making faces at me under that?

01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.705
President Skroob.
There it is. Planet Druidia.

01:04:23.999 --> 01:04:26.038
Ah, Planet Druidia.

01:04:26.168 --> 01:04:28.920
And 10,000 years of fresh air.

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:32.047
- Way he runs things, it won't last 100.
- What?

01:04:32.174 --> 01:04:36.041
- Preparing ship for metamorphosis, sir.
- Good. Get on with it.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:38.217
Ready, Kafka?

01:04:44.394 --> 01:04:46.635
Look, it's Spaceball One.

01:04:47.855 --> 01:04:52.185
- They've reached the air shield
- And it's opening

01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:56.819
The ship's too big

01:04:56.948 --> 01:04:59.949
How they gonna get the air out?
I don't see any hoses.

01:05:05.331 --> 01:05:07.370
What's happening?

01:05:09.961 --> 01:05:12.497
The ship... is changing.

01:05:26.477 --> 01:05:28.516
Oh, my gosh.

01:05:28.646 --> 01:05:30.934
It's not just a spaceship.

01:05:31.063 --> 01:05:33.102
It's a Transformer!

01:05:43.452 --> 01:05:47.402
- It's changing into
- A gigantic

01:05:47.539 --> 01:05:52.081
- Maid?
- With a vacuum cleaner

01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:55.413
So that's how
they're gonna get the air out

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.441
Metamorphosis completed, sir.

01:06:18.569 --> 01:06:20.857
Spaceball One has now become

01:06:25.158 --> 01:06:26.568
Megamaid.

01:06:26.952 --> 01:06:29.408
- Good.
- Remarkable.

01:06:29.537 --> 01:06:32.028
Now, commence Operation

01:06:32.165 --> 01:06:33.790
Vacu-Suck!

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.590
Suck. Suck. Suck!

01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:59.770
Goodbye, little Vespa.

01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.984
My... little...

01:07:04.113 --> 01:07:06.402
..baby... Vespa.

01:07:13.498 --> 01:07:16.416
- The air bag, it's almost full!
- What'll we do?

01:07:20.254 --> 01:07:23.254
We've gotta act fast.
Step one: we reverse the vacuum

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.457
and blow the air back on to the planet.

01:07:25.593 --> 01:07:29.091
Step two: we destroy that thing.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.054
- But isn't that dangerous?
- Extremely. Plus,

01:07:33.976 --> 01:07:37.013
I don't know
how the hell we're gonna do it.

01:07:37.145 --> 01:07:40.478
- What about that ring Yogurt gave you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:40.607 --> 01:07:43.181
- But...
- Come on, boss. Give it a shot.

01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:45.774
OK. Here goes nothing.

01:07:55.247 --> 01:07:57.488
- Look at that
- Wow!

01:07:58.248 --> 01:08:00.372
It's working!

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.704
Come on, Schwartz.

01:08:03.837 --> 01:08:07.752
Come on, Schwartz. Come on, Schwartz!

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.923
- Helmet, what's going on?
- Sandurz, what's going on?

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.885
It's Megamaid.

01:08:18.018 --> 01:08:20.140
She's gone from suck to blow.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.429
What? They're getting their air back.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.604
- Do something.
- Do something.

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.312
Do something!

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:44.413
I'm breathing.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.913
Air.

01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:50.006
Air!

01:08:58.057 --> 01:09:00.383
- Dim the lights.
- Dimming the lights.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.841
- Go to infrared.
- Going to infrared.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:06.102
- Pray to God.
- Praying to God.

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:18.154
Careful. Careful.

01:09:24.959 --> 01:09:26.785
What are you doing?

01:09:26.919 --> 01:09:28.957
Scanning.

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:39.179
There's gotta be a self-destruct
mechanism in the central brain area.

01:09:43.769 --> 01:09:46.520
- I think we just found it.
- Where?

01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:48.685
Watch.

01:09:52.568 --> 01:09:55.523
Bingo! There it is.

01:09:56.155 --> 01:09:58.398
It's right below us.

01:09:58.533 --> 01:10:01.950
- Put her in hover, Barf.
- Putting her in hover.

01:10:02.536 --> 01:10:05.537
- I'm going down there.
- He's going down there.

01:10:06.207 --> 01:10:08.246
I wouldn't.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:51.581
What the hell are you doing?

01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:55.041
The... Vulcan neck pinch?

01:10:55.171 --> 01:10:57.793
No, no, no, stupid.
You got it much too high.

01:10:57.924 --> 01:11:00.759
It's down here
where the shoulder meets the neck.

01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:03.554
- Like this?
- Yeah!

01:11:06.182 --> 01:11:08.221
Thanks.

01:11:12.938 --> 01:11:15.855
Handprint identification, please

01:11:15.984 --> 01:11:18.652
Handprint identification, please

01:11:19.069 --> 01:11:21.441
Handprint identification, please

01:11:22.072 --> 01:11:23.899
Handprint

01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:27.742
Thanks again.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:37.909
Is that you, Mylar?

01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:50.258
Who are you? What are you doing?

01:11:50.392 --> 01:11:52.219
This.

01:11:56.981 --> 01:11:58.808
Sweet dreams.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:18.917
Not so fast, Lone Starr.

01:12:19.045 --> 01:12:20.455
Helmet!

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:25.131
So, at last we meet for the first time,
for the last time.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:32.055
Before you die, there is something
you should know about us, Lone Starr.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.218
What?

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:40.432
I am your father's brother's nephew's
cousin's former roommate.

01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:46.519
- What's that make us?
- Absolutely nothing!

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.989
Which is what you are about to become.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.906
Prepare to die.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.120
You have the ring.

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:05.338
And I see your Schwartz is as big as mine.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:10.798
Now let's see how well you handle it.

01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:35.526
Um... He did it.

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:38.075
What?

01:13:53.928 --> 01:13:57.511
Shit! I hate it
when I get my Schwartz twisted.

01:13:58.099 --> 01:14:01.184
OK, maybe if I put my leg up on yours,

01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:03.350
we could split apart like...

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.767
Good, yeah. One, two, three, go!

01:14:48.523 --> 01:14:52.437
So, Lone Starr,
Yogurt has taught you well.

01:14:53.694 --> 01:14:57.396
If there's one thing I despise,
it is a fair fight.

01:14:57.531 --> 01:15:01.696
But if I must, then I must.
May the best man win.

01:15:02.536 --> 01:15:04.575
Put 'er there.

01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:12.251
The ring! I can't believe
you fell for the oldest trick in the book!

01:15:12.379 --> 01:15:16.757
What a goof!
What's with you, man? Come on!

01:15:16.884 --> 01:15:19.208
You know what?
Let me give it back to you. Oh!

01:15:19.344 --> 01:15:23.638
Oh, look at that. You fell for that, too.
I can't believe it, man.

01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:30.811
So, Lone Starr, now you see
that evil will always triumph

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.181
because good is dumb.

01:15:42.783 --> 01:15:48.159
Very impressive, Lone Starr. Too bad
this isn't the Wide World of Sports.

01:15:49.124 --> 01:15:52.409
Use the Schwartz, Lone Starr
Use the Schwartz

01:15:52.544 --> 01:15:54.620
I can't. I lost the ring.

01:15:54.754 --> 01:15:57.623
Forget the ring. The ring is bupkis

01:15:57.757 --> 01:16:00.426
I found it in a Cracker Jack box

01:16:00.552 --> 01:16:04.252
The Schwartz is in you, Lone Starr
It's in you!

01:16:04.389 --> 01:16:06.512
All right. I'll try.

01:16:06.641 --> 01:16:09.643
Say goodbye to your two best friends.

01:16:09.769 --> 01:16:12.556
And I don't mean
your pals in the Winnebago.

01:16:21.656 --> 01:16:24.325
Thank you for pressing
the self-destruct button

01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:27.534
This ship will self-destruct
in three minutes

01:16:32.164 --> 01:16:35.700
What's going on?
Where the hell are we? Paris?

01:16:35.835 --> 01:16:37.663
Thank you for pressing the button

01:16:37.796 --> 01:16:42.791
This ship will self-destruct
in exactly two minutes and 45 seconds

01:16:42.926 --> 01:16:45.085
Stop it. Is there any way to stop it?

01:16:45.219 --> 01:16:47.344
I can't. It's irreversible.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:49.096
Like my raincoat.

01:16:49.225 --> 01:16:52.923
Attention, this is Colonel Sandurz
in forward command. Abandon ship!

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.264
Abandon ship!
All personnel proceed to escape pods.

01:16:56.731 --> 01:16:59.436
Close down the circus. Evacuate the zoo.

01:16:59.567 --> 01:17:04.027
The self-destruct mechanism
has been activated. Abandon ship.

01:17:04.363 --> 01:17:06.653
Sandurz! Sandurz, you gotta help me.

01:17:06.783 --> 01:17:10.732
I don't know what to do.
I can't make decisions. I'm a president!

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:15.663
This is your two-minute warning. This
ship will self-destruct in two minutes

01:17:15.791 --> 01:17:18.875
Launch all escape pods
once they are filled.

01:17:19.003 --> 01:17:20.912
What's happening? Where is he?

01:17:21.297 --> 01:17:23.455
Spaceballs

01:17:23.592 --> 01:17:25.631
Watch out!

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:29.504
- Where is he?
- Here.

01:17:29.638 --> 01:17:32.674
We got a minute and 40
before the end of the world. Hang on!

01:17:32.807 --> 01:17:34.846
Spaceballs

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.052
Full throttle.

01:17:38.188 --> 01:17:40.513
- Go to hyper jets.
- Going to hyper jets.

01:17:41.692 --> 01:17:45.902
If you're livin' in a bubble
And you haven't got a care

01:17:46.029 --> 01:17:49.232
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Pizza to go!

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:53.493
Then you're gonna be in trouble
Cos we're gonna steal your air

01:17:56.623 --> 01:18:00.573
Cos what you've got is what we need
And all we do is dirty deeds

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:03.083
We're the Spaceballs

01:18:03.254 --> 01:18:04.202
Watch out

01:18:04.338 --> 01:18:07.422
We're the Spaceballs

01:18:11.304 --> 01:18:13.794
Hey, that's my escape pod. Who are you?

01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:17.015
I'm the bearded lady.
What are you, one of the freaks?

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.599
Hey, come back! That's my pod! No!

01:18:26.193 --> 01:18:29.111
Come back, you fat, bearded bitch!

01:18:29.987 --> 01:18:31.614
One pod left.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.409
And three of us.
And I'm the president.

01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:38.996
Well, boys, it's a very lovely ship.
I think you should go down with it.

01:18:39.372 --> 01:18:41.411
Goodbye.

01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:46.250
What's the matter with this belt?

01:18:54.013 --> 01:18:55.589
Spaceballs

01:18:55.722 --> 01:18:58.295
This ship will self-destruct in 20 seconds

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:01.350
It's your last chance
to push the cancellation button

01:19:01.477 --> 01:19:03.718
Cancellation button? Hurry!

01:19:05.147 --> 01:19:07.472
Spaceballs

01:19:07.608 --> 01:19:09.649
Watch out!

01:19:11.529 --> 01:19:14.316
- Where is it? Where is it?
- It's gotta be here.

01:19:14.448 --> 01:19:17.899
- Out of order.
- Fuck! Even in the future nothing works.

01:19:18.035 --> 01:19:21.239
This ship will self-destruct
in exactly ten seconds

01:19:22.331 --> 01:19:23.955
Counting down

01:19:24.082 --> 01:19:26.206
Ten, nine,

01:19:26.335 --> 01:19:28.162
eight, six

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.335
Six? What happened to seven?

01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:32.291
Just kidding

01:19:32.592 --> 01:19:34.631
There's the other end. Faster!

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.760
Six, five, four,

01:19:37.888 --> 01:19:40.889
three, two, one

01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:44.060
- Have a nice day
- Thank you.

01:19:55.029 --> 01:19:56.856
We did it!

01:20:03.454 --> 01:20:05.494
We all did it.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:28.727
So I guess you might call that
a case of man bites droid?

01:20:31.481 --> 01:20:34.352
On a sadder note, Pizza The Hutt,

01:20:34.485 --> 01:20:37.236
famed half-man, half-pizza,

01:20:37.361 --> 01:20:41.692
was found dead earlier today
in the back seat of his stretch limo

01:20:41.909 --> 01:20:48.113
Evidently, the notorious gangster became
locked in his car and ate himself to death

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:52.199
Coming up:
Pongo's review of "Rocky Five

01:20:52.335 --> 01:20:54.791
Thousand" Pongo?

01:20:56.297 --> 01:20:58.705
Did you hear that?
Pizza kicked the bucket.

01:20:58.841 --> 01:21:03.219
Now we don't have to pay him the million.
We can keep it for ourselves.

01:21:03.387 --> 01:21:05.215
Yeah.

01:21:22.781 --> 01:21:25.866
- Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
- Oh, Vespa, my darling.

01:21:25.993 --> 01:21:29.824
I thought I'd never see you again.
Oh, my sweet little daughter.

01:21:29.955 --> 01:21:32.197
I'm so happy that you're home and safe.

01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:36.873
And, little Vespa, here's someone else
who's happy to see you.

01:21:39.548 --> 01:21:41.754
Oh, hello.

01:21:41.883 --> 01:21:44.125
Where have you been?

01:21:58.817 --> 01:22:00.857
Thanks, hon.

01:22:12.413 --> 01:22:14.240
Hiya, big stuff.

01:22:14.374 --> 01:22:15.784
Hi, dream.

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:20.124
- What'll you have?
- We're just gassing up, so what's ready?

01:22:20.254 --> 01:22:22.579
I got the space soup or the space special.

01:22:22.715 --> 01:22:25.798
- Um, I'll have the soup.
- OK.

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:28.583
I'll have the cleavage. Uh, the special.

01:22:29.805 --> 01:22:33.091
OK, one special and one soup.

01:22:36.311 --> 01:22:39.680
- Ready to order?
- Hi. Yes, we'll both have the lunafish.

01:22:39.814 --> 01:22:43.231
Anything to drink?
Hey, watch where you stick that thing!

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.151
Huh? Oh, look, it's got a mind of its own,
sweetheart. I can't do a thing with it.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.994
- Jeez!
- What?

01:22:55.121 --> 01:22:58.489
No, we were lost.
None of us knew where we were.

01:22:58.624 --> 01:23:03.334
And then Harry began feeling around
on all the trees.

01:23:03.462 --> 01:23:06.832
Then he said "I got it. We on Pluto".

01:23:06.966 --> 01:23:11.675
And we said "Harry, how can you tell?"
He said "From the bark, you dummy!"

01:23:11.804 --> 01:23:13.843
From the bark!

01:23:17.309 --> 01:23:19.135
Is he all right?

01:23:21.439 --> 01:23:24.108
- Hey, what's wrong with this guy?
- I don't know!

01:23:27.528 --> 01:23:29.983
- Bring him some water!
- Water, my ass!

01:23:30.113 --> 01:23:32.403
Bring this guy some Pepto-Bismol!

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:36.075
Waitress! Waitress! What did he order?

01:23:36.203 --> 01:23:39.287
- Oh, he had the special.
- The spe... That's my order!

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:42.285
- Change my order to the soup.
- Good move.

01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:52.632
Oh, no.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.800
Not again.

01:24:05.982 --> 01:24:08.353
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey

01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:10.312
Hello, my ragtime gal

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.776
Send me a kiss by wire

01:24:12.906 --> 01:24:15.146
Baby, my heart's on fire

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:17.691
If you refuse me Honey, you'll lose me

01:24:17.826 --> 01:24:20.827
Then you'll be left alone
Oh, baby, telephone

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:24.323
And tell me I'm your own

01:24:27.002 --> 01:24:29.244
Check, please.

01:24:39.222 --> 01:24:41.760
Five minutes to magic time.

01:24:41.892 --> 01:24:45.011
Are you all right, my dear?
You look a little... flighty.

01:24:45.145 --> 01:24:48.679
Don't worry about me, Father.
I'm completely over him.

01:24:49.064 --> 01:24:54.060
Huh! Didn't even stay for the wedding.
Just grabbed his million bucks and ran.

01:24:54.612 --> 01:24:56.901
He didn't take the million.

01:24:57.033 --> 01:24:58.859
- He didn't?
- No.

01:24:59.368 --> 01:25:03.200
He just took 248 space bucks
for lunch, gas and tolls.

01:25:13.798 --> 01:25:19.302
I can't believe you refused the money. But
we could've stayed for food. I'm starving.

01:25:19.429 --> 01:25:21.717
- Have you got anything to eat?
- Nah.

01:25:22.641 --> 01:25:26.090
Oh, wait a minute.
Yogurt gave me that fortune cookie.

01:25:26.226 --> 01:25:28.267
- Here, chow down.
- Wow, thanks.

01:25:28.396 --> 01:25:30.222
- I'll split it.
- No.

01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:32.182
OK.

01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:37.650
- Yogurt!
- Hello, boys.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.315
Well, you opened your fortune cookie,
so here's your fortune.

01:25:41.451 --> 01:25:45.281
Lone Starr, you know
that medallion that you wear,

01:25:45.411 --> 01:25:48.578
but you don't know what it means?
Here's what it means.

01:25:48.915 --> 01:25:51.832
It's a royal birth certificate. Yes!

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.375
Your father was a king,
your mother was a queen,

01:25:55.504 --> 01:25:59.169
which makes you a certified prince.

01:25:59.426 --> 01:26:01.797
Hey, I'm a prince.

01:26:01.927 --> 01:26:04.086
I'm a prince! Which means...

01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:08.385
Which means if you hurry
there could be a princess in your future.

01:26:08.517 --> 01:26:11.305
If you wanna stop her
marrying Sleeping Beauty,

01:26:11.437 --> 01:26:14.723
there's a special can of fuel
in your glove compartment.

01:26:14.858 --> 01:26:16.897
- Good luck, boys.
- Bye, Yogurt.

01:26:17.026 --> 01:26:18.853
And, Yogurt,...

01:26:18.986 --> 01:26:21.227
- ..thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:26:21.363 --> 01:26:27.567
And may the Schwartz be with youuuuu!

01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:30.409
Oh, what a world.

01:26:30.539 --> 01:26:34.585
- Barf, open that glove compartment.
- You got it... Your Highness.

01:26:37.962 --> 01:26:40.668
Wow! Liquid Schwartz!

01:26:40.798 --> 01:26:43.123
- Quick, pour it in the tank.
- Right.

01:26:47.389 --> 01:26:49.429
Look at that!

01:26:50.475 --> 01:26:52.384
- Done.
- Hang on, Barfo,

01:26:52.518 --> 01:26:55.093
we're gonna make space tracks.

01:27:47.322 --> 01:27:50.940
Dear me, what are those things
coming out of her nose?

01:27:52.243 --> 01:27:54.283
Hey, hey, watch my helmet.

01:27:57.499 --> 01:27:59.326
Spaceballs!

01:27:59.626 --> 01:28:02.710
Oh, shit. There goes the planet.

01:28:05.632 --> 01:28:09.961
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together...

01:28:10.594 --> 01:28:12.005
..again.

01:28:12.138 --> 01:28:15.637
- You didn't say he refused the money.
- It wasn't important.

01:28:16.225 --> 01:28:20.306
- May I continue, please?
- Besides, he asked me not to tell you.

01:28:21.022 --> 01:28:22.849
Thank you.

01:28:22.983 --> 01:28:28.272
To join Princess Vespa
and Princess Valium...

01:28:29.238 --> 01:28:31.609
I'm sorry, it's the hair.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.566
Prince Valium

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.109
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

01:28:36.245 --> 01:28:39.282
I see it all now.
Don't you see he loves me?

01:28:39.664 --> 01:28:43.829
I'm trying to conduct a wedding here,
which has nothing to do with love. Quiet.

01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:45.585
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:28:45.712 --> 01:28:48.332
- I'm sorry, too.
- Don't be sorry, be quiet.

01:28:48.465 --> 01:28:50.707
I'm sorry!

01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:59.677
To join Princess Vespa and Prince Valium
in the bonds of holy...

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:01.007
..moly!

01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:07.640
Uh... matrimony.

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:10.230
That's him.
I know it's him. He's come back!

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.397
That's it. No more chances.
We're doing the short version.

01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:16.735
Prince Valium, do you take
Princess Vespa to be your wife?

01:29:16.868 --> 01:29:18.066
Uh-huh.

01:29:18.203 --> 01:29:22.449
- Do you take Valium to be your husband?
- Uh... well, I...

01:29:22.582 --> 01:29:25.617
I suppose. Well, oh, I don't know.

01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:27.992
- No! She doesn't.
- What?

01:29:33.425 --> 01:29:36.760
- Who the hell are you?
- Prince Lone Starr.

01:29:37.387 --> 01:29:39.546
- Prince?!
- I just found out.

01:29:39.932 --> 01:29:43.382
That's what this says.
I'm an honest-to-God prince.

01:29:43.518 --> 01:29:45.142
Will you marry me?

01:29:45.688 --> 01:29:47.727
Well, let me think about it.

01:29:49.191 --> 01:29:50.600
Yes!

01:29:50.734 --> 01:29:54.780
I'm sick of this. I don't care who it is,
but I'm gonna marry somebody today.

01:29:54.905 --> 01:29:57.905
- Who are you?
- I'm the best man, Barf.

01:29:58.033 --> 01:30:00.358
- Full name?
- Barfolomew.

01:30:00.743 --> 01:30:02.782
- Are you getting married?
- No.

01:30:02.912 --> 01:30:04.536
Then get over there!

01:30:04.872 --> 01:30:08.288
OK, here we go. The short, short version.

01:30:08.417 --> 01:30:10.244
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:30:10.378 --> 01:30:11.576
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:14.382
Good. You're married. Kiss her!

01:30:14.507 --> 01:30:17.177
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:30:28.396 --> 01:30:31.147
Well, goodbye, Virgin Alarm.

01:32:48.197 --> 01:32:52.693
If you're livin' in a bubble
And you haven't got a care

01:32:55.830 --> 01:33:00.292
Then you're gonna be in trouble
Cos we're gonna steal your air

01:33:03.254 --> 01:33:07.002
Cos what you've got is what we need
And all we do is dirty deeds

01:33:07.132 --> 01:33:09.339
We're the Spaceballs

01:33:09.886 --> 01:33:10.751
Watch out!

01:33:10.886 --> 01:33:13.804
We're the Spaceballs

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.716
We're the masters of space

01:33:16.852 --> 01:33:20.552
-Hey, don't mess around
-With the Spaceballs

01:33:29.989 --> 01:33:34.401
Going cruisin' in a spaceship
We're so good at being bad

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:42.288
We'll destroy your little planet
If you ever get us mad

01:33:44.878 --> 01:33:49.042
We're mothers of the galaxy
You better scatter when you see

01:33:49.173 --> 01:33:51.213
The Spaceballs

01:33:51.508 --> 01:33:52.458

-Say what? Don't mess around
-With the Spaceballs

01:34:02.979 --> 01:34:05.019
Watch out!

01:34:33.425 --> 01:34:35.833
We're mothers of the galaxy

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:40.298
We're gonna take the air you breathe

01:34:40.849 --> 01:34:44.348
Oh! Spaceballs

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.426
Watch out!

01:34:45.562 --> 01:34:48.397
We're the Spaceballs

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.733
We're the masters of space

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.643
Don't mess around with the Spaceballs

01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.730
Watch out!

01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:59.438
We're the Spaceballs

01:35:00.577 --> 01:35:03.114
We're the masters of space

01:35:03.245 --> 01:35:07.030
Don't mess around with the Spaceballs

01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:07.997

01:35:08.126 --> 01:35:10.367
We've got a bossin' metal ship

01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:13.918
So you better watch your lip

01:35:15.507 --> 01:35:18.426
Cos we're the Spaceballs

01:35:18.553 --> 01:35:19.582
Watch out!

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.175
You may think that you are bad

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.224
But believe you can be had

01:35:27.019 --> 01:35:29.725
By the Spaceballs

01:35:29.855 --> 01:35:30.804
Watch out!

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:33.560
We're the Spaceballs

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.790
Watch out!

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.559
We're the Spaceballs

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.833
We're the masters of space

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.555
Don't mess around with the Spaceballs

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.116
We're so bad and mean

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.278
We make nightmares out of dreams

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.673
We're the Spaceballs

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.193
We're the Spaceballs

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.392
So you'd better watch out!

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.476
Hee-hee, ha-ha!
