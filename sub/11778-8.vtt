09:29.902 --> 09:31.612
- TWO HOURS REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.530
TWO HOURS.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.825
- I CAME UP
WITH A NEW-SCHOOL ANCHOR.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.201
- JIME GOT SOME THIGHS
ON HIM.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.995
{\an8}- THIS KIND OF REMINDS ME
TO STAY TRUE TO MYSELF

09:39.078 --> 09:40.705
{\an8}AS AN ARTIST.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.998
{\an8}- I THOUGHT
I WOULD PICK JIME,

09:42.081 --> 09:43.708
{\an8}BUT I DIDN'T WANNA TRY
AND DO NEW-SCHOOL.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.793
{\an8}I'M REALLY SURPRISED
HOW JIME DID THIS TATTOO.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.420
{\an8}NEW-SCHOOL AND PROPORTION
DON'T REALLY FIT TOGETHER.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.006
HE'S SHOOTING HIMSELF
IN THE FOOT.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.842
- FIVE, FOUR,

09:52.925 --> 09:55.594
THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.513
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP, EVERYBODY.

09:57.596 --> 10:00.099
MACHINES DOWN.
NO MORE INK.

10:00.182 --> 10:03.019

[bleep] YEAH.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.146
- JOEY, WHAT EXACTLY
IS THAT?

10:05.229 --> 10:06.397
- IT'S THE INK MASTER
GOLD SKULL.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.816
- THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE EYES,
THE NOSE, THE TEETH,

10:08.899 --> 10:10.943
EVERYTHING SHOWS
REALLY NICE PROPORTION.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.570
AND THE FLOWER'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.487
- CRAIG.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.155
- THIS THING KINDA HAS
NEW-SCHOOLY,

10:14.238 --> 10:15.531
CARTOONISH EFFECT TO IT.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.534
IF THIS THING LOOKED
MORE REALISTIC,

10:18.617 --> 10:19.160
YOU WOULD BE ABLE
TO FOLLOW THAT PROPORTION

10:19.243 --> 10:21.412
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.371

10:22.455 --> 10:24.415
- PROPORTION--
THE SHADOW UNDERNEATH IT

10:24.498 --> 10:25.207
IS PROPORTIONATE
OF THE BALL.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.293
- IT'S A SINGULAR ITEM,

10:27.376 --> 10:28.669
BUT IT'S PROPORTIONED
TO ITSELF.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.796
- THAT'S A REACH.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.881
- JACKIE.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.007
- I DREW UP A GRENADE

10:33.090 --> 10:34.383
AND THEN PLACED THE PIN
IN FRONT OF IT,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.552
SHOWING THAT IT EQUALS UP.

10:36.635 --> 10:37.928

10:39.472 --> 10:41.557

WITH THIS CHALLENGE.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.725
- JIME.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.517
- THE IDEA OF IT IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE RULES

10:43.601 --> 10:44.560
BEFORE YOU CAN BREAK
THE RULES.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.395
UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THE PROPORTIONS ARE,

10:46.479 --> 10:48.939
I KNOW HOW MUCH
I CAN EXAGGERATE IT.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.067
- DEFINITELY HAS
THAT NEW-SCHOOL, WACKY SHAPE,

10:51.150 --> 10:52.485
WHICH I THINK
KIND OF DRAWS IT

10:52.568 --> 10:55.029
OUT OF THE GAME
FOR PROPORTION.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.823
- BABY, YOU SEEMED PRETTY HAPPY
TO BE PAIRED UP WITH JIME.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.619
- I WAS JUST HAPPY
I DIDN'T GET JOSH.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.245
- FOR THIS CHALLENGE,
I THINK IT GOES ALONG

11:03.329 --> 11:04.914
THE SAME THING WHAT I SAID
ABOUT JIME.

11:04.997 --> 11:05.623
IT DOESN'T REALLY FOLLOW

11:05.706 --> 11:07.792
THE GUIDELINES
OF PROPORTION.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.377
{\an8}- IF IT DIDN'T HAVE PROPORTION,

11:09.460 --> 11:11.128
{\an8}THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE

11:11.212 --> 11:12.546
- KYLE.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.881
- YOU ENDED UP WITH ONE
OF THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNERS

11:13.964 --> 11:17.635
TO DO THAT DESIGN 'CAUSE
THE LINE WORK IS ALMOST PERFECT.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.095
- AS FAR
AS THE PROPORTION GOES,

11:19.178 --> 11:22.139
EVERYTHING IS
THE RIGHT SIZES.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.432
- JOSHUA.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017

OF PROPORTION,

11:25.101 --> 11:26.644
NOT JUST THE TWO HANDS
WITH EACH OTHER

11:26.727 --> 11:28.604
BUT EVERY FINGER
AGAINST THE OTHER FINGER.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.897
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.607
{\an8}- WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:31.690 --> 11:32.525
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.152
{\an8}AS FAR AS HITTING THE NAIL
ON HEAD,

11:35.236 --> 11:37.321
{\an8}I FRICKIN' DID IT FOR SURE.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.201
{\an8}- YOUR CANVASES THIS WEEK
MIGHT LOOK FAMILIAR.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.869
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].

11:43.953 --> 11:46.997
YOU'RE DEFINITELY ONE PERSON
THAT I DO NOT WANNA TATTOO.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.874
- THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

11:56.966 --> 11:57.967
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.302
PROPORTION CHALLENGE.
WHO WOULD BE THE BOTTOM?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.597
JIME AND TATU BABY
AND JASON AND JACKIE.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.474
- YEAH.
- JASON DID THE DARUMA DOLL.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.642
- IF THERE WAS ANOTHER
RELATIVE-SIZE ITEM NEXT TO IT,

12:06.725 --> 12:09.019
IT WOULD'VE BROUGHT IT OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.314
- BUT IT IS MORE PROPORTION
THAN TATU BABY AND JIME.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.483

12:14.567 --> 12:17.153

12:17.236 --> 12:20.030

JOEY-CRAIG AND KYLE-JOSHUA.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.323
- CORRECT.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.617
- KYLE'S DRAWING,
HAVING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS

12:23.701 --> 12:25.578
AND HAVING IT BE REALISTIC
IS THE KEY.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.331
- JOSHUA, ARE THOSE HANDS
IN PROPORTION TO THE BRUSH?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.166
- THE BRUSHES ARE
DIFFERENT SIZES,

12:30.249 --> 12:32.626
SO IT'S A PASS
THAT YOU GET AWAY WITH.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.045

JIME AND TATU BABY,

CRAIG TO THE SAME STANDARD

12:39.091 --> 12:40.176

YOU GUYS GOOD?

- YEAH, LET'S TELL 'EM.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.474

THE CRITERIA.

TO MEET YOU.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.852
- CLINT.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.479
- SARAH, YOU COULD TAKE
A SEAT,

17:43.562 --> 17:46.398
BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY ONE PERSON
THAT I DO NOT WANNA TATTOO.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.568
- THAT'S FINE, I WOULDN'T HAVE
CHOSEN YOU ANYWAY.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.402
- WHAT UP, MAN?
- WHAT'S UP?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.154
HOW YOU DOING?
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.406
- MY IDEA IS A WOMAN
SITTING IN A CHAIR,

17:54.490 --> 17:56.033
A MACHINE IS IN HER HAND,

17:56.116 --> 17:57.242
AND SHE IS HAVING
AN INK-GASM.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.496
FEMALES SEEM TO LIKE TO [bleep]
WHILE I'M TATTOOING 'EM.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.663
- OH, YEAH, THAT--
THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.081
{\an8}I DEFINITELY DON'T CONNECT
WITH THAT KIND OF ARTWORK,

18:03.165 --> 18:04.416
{\an8}SO I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE PICKING HIM.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.585
{\an8}I WISH YOU LUCK.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.003
{\an8}I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY AWESOME TATTOO.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.047
{\an8}- JOSHUA'S PLAYING IT SAFE,
BUT GROW A PAIR, BUDDY.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.884
{\an8}- SWITCH ROOMS,
PLEASE, ARTISTS.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.344
{\an8}- IS A LOT
OF THIS STUFF OLDER?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.054
{\an8}- SOME OF IT IS.
THAT'S ALL--

18:17.137 --> 18:18.013
{\an8}- THIS LOOKS NEWER.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.890
{\an8}- HER PERSONA LAST YEAR
WAS NOT AN ACT.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.267
- DOWN MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

18:22.351 --> 18:26.188
MIND IF I DID A QUICK SKETCH?
- NO.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.190
BITCH, WHO THE [bleep]
ARE YOU?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.651
- I WANNA DO A COLOR
ARMY GIRL PINUP ON MY THIGH.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.652
- [bleep] YEAH.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.237
- I'VE GOT DRAWINGS
THAT I'VE DONE ALREADY.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.405
I WILL LET YOU KINDA DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT...

18:35.489 --> 18:39.493
- KINDA TIE THEM TOGETHER.
- BECAUSE I LOVE YOUR STUFF.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.081
- KYLE AND JOSHUA, BECAUSE
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

18:44.164 --> 18:46.041
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHOOSE
YOUR OWN CANVASES.

18:46.125 --> 18:46.750
KYLE, LET'S START
WITH YOU.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.587
WHO DO YOU PICK
TO TATTOO?

18:50.671 --> 18:52.756
- SARAH.

18:54.883 --> 18:55.968
SARAH CAME DAMN CLOSE
TO WINNING.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.053
SHE CAN HELP ME
WITH THE DESIGN.

18:58.136 --> 19:01.473
- JOSHUA, WHICH CANVAS
HAVE YOU CHOSEN?

19:01.557 --> 19:02.683
- I'VE CHOSEN TJ.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.519
{\an8}- HE FOUND A NICE DESIGN
THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO DRAW,

19:05.602 --> 19:07.229
{\an8}AND HE'S GONNA DO
WHAT JOSH DOES BEST,

19:07.312 --> 19:08.188
{\an8}JUST COPY.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.648
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

19:09.731 --> 19:11.233
THE REST OF YOU
WILL CHOOSE A SKULL

19:11.316 --> 19:12.860
TO DETERMINE
YOUR PICKING ORDER.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.028
LET'S START WITH MARK.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.905
- NUMBER ONE.
- RON.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.241
- ONE OF MY BIGGEST IDOLS
IS HERE, JIME LITWALK.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.534
I LOVE NEW-SCHOOL WORK.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.661
{\an8}IF THE TATTOO GODS
ARE ON MY MOTHER[bleep] SIDE,

19:22.744 --> 19:24.830
{\an8}THAT'S WHO I'M GETTING
TATTOOED BY.

19:24.913 --> 19:25.789
NUMBER FIVE.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.083
- KAY.
- TWO.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.043
- CEE JAY.
- THREE.

19:30.127 --> 19:33.422
- CLINT?
- NUMBER FOUR.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.382
- SO, NICK,
YOU'RE NUMBER SIX.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.801
MARK, YOU PICKED
SKULL NUMBER ONE.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.760
GO AHEAD AND CHOOSE
YOUR ARTIST.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.847
- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND ROCK WITH JIME.

19:41.930 --> 19:42.639
{\an8}- IT'S MOTHER[bleep] MARK.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.975
{\an8}[bleep] ASS[bleep].

19:45.058 --> 19:46.894
{\an8}- KAY KUTTA,
YOU PICKED SKULL NUMBER TWO.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.270
{\an8}GO AHEAD AND SELECT
YOUR ARTIST.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.189
{\an8}- I WANT TATU BABY, BUT
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WANTS ME.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.610
{\an8}- PLEASE DON'T PICK ME.
PLEASE DON'T PICK ME.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.154
- I'MA GO WITH CRAIG.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.239
- CEE JAY, GO AHEAD
AND PICK YOUR ARTIST.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.949
- I'LL GO WITH THE GUY
IN THE BLUE SHIRT.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.076
- CLINT, SKULL NUMBER FOUR.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.536
- I'MA GO
WITH MY GIRL BABY.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.787
- RON, SKULL NUMBER FIVE.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.039
- I'M GONNA GO
WITH JASON.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.374
- SO, NICK,
BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION,

20:09.458 --> 20:10.459
THAT MEANS THAT JACKIE
IS YOUR ARTIST.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.460
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.046
- YOUR CANVASES KNOW
TATTOOING FIRSTHAND.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.924
THEY WILL BE
YOUR HUMAN CANVAS JURY,

20:17.007 --> 20:18.842
AND THESE GUYS ARE SURE
TO BE BRUTAL.

20:18.926 --> 20:23.472
THEY WILL PUT ONE OF YOU UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.932
YOU HAVE THE REST
OF THE EVENING

20:25.015 --> 20:25.933
TO CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644
TOMORROW,
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

20:28.727 --> 20:30.812
TO COMPLETE
YOUR PINUP TATTOO.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.648
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.108
GOOD LUCK.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.277
{\an8}- TODAY, WE'RE GONNA
TEST PROPORTION

20:37.361 --> 20:39.237
{\an8}THROUGH OUR FAVORITE THING:
PINUPS.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.115
PINUPS ALWAYS REQUIRE
SOME MANIPULATION.

20:42.199 --> 20:42.658
- WE GOT THIS [bleep].
- YEAH.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.826
- I'M EXCITED.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.328
- YOU HAVE TO EXAGGERATE
CERTAIN THINGS

20:46.411 --> 20:49.081
TO MAKE AN APPEALING,
ATTRACTIVE, BEAUTIFUL FIGURE

20:49.164 --> 20:50.666
WITH A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.875
- WHAT WOULD YOU REALLY
LIKE TO DO?

20:51.959 --> 20:55.545
- I ENJOY DOING PINUPS, SO
I'M GOING TO KILL IT EITHER WAY.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.506
- SO BLACK AND GRAY, CLASSIC.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.299
LET'S SEE,
THERE'S, LIKE, ARMY GIRLS,

20:59.383 --> 21:01.134
SAILOR GIRLS,
PIRATE GIRLS.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.511
- I'D BE HAPPY
WITH, LIKE, A PIRATE

21:02.594 --> 21:04.012
'CAUSE I'M INTO PIRATES,
THAT'S ALL.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.723
- OH, LET'S DO A HOT PIRATE.
- YEAH, I MEAN, DEFINITELY.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.307
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT DIRECTION?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.809
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:08.892 --> 21:10.269
- I'D LIKE TO SEE
MORE EYES.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.645
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THE FACE.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.938
I LIKE BIG [bleep] HEADS ALSO.
I MEAN, THAT'S...

21:13.021 --> 21:14.314
- THE TRICK IS PROPORTION.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.650
IF I MAKE HER HAVE BIGGER EYES
THAN WHAT SHE'S GOT,

21:16.733 --> 21:17.567
THEN IT WON'T BE
OUT OF PROPORTION.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.695
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA GET ME
KICKED OFF, DUDE.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.029
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'RE GONNA LET ME PUT

21:21.113 --> 21:23.365
SOME BIG-ASS HEAD ON THERE
LIKE THAT

21:23.448 --> 21:24.157
WITH SOME BIG-ASS EYEBALLS.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.410
THE THING
FOR THE CHALLENGE

21:26.493 --> 21:28.120
FOR THIS THING
IS PROPORTION.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.162
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GET
A NEW-SCHOOL PINUP.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.330
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT THE [bleep]
I WANT.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.748
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT THE [bleep]
I'M GONNA GET.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.542
IF I DON'T LIKE IT,
I'M GONNA WALK THE [bleep] OUT.

21:33.625 --> 21:37.587
- THIS SUCKS.
I TOTALLY FEEL SCREWED.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.895
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HOW'S IT LOOK?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.732
YOU WANNA CHANGE SOMETHING?

21:56.815 --> 21:57.733
- YEAH.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.484
THIS?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.486
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.071
THE BREASTS ARE NOT
WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.323
THE FACE IS JUST JACKED.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.950
BOY, I'M FREAKING OUT.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.704
YOU HAD A REALLY NICE DRAWING
YESTERDAY.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.247
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN FIND THAT BOOK?

22:12.330 --> 22:16.084
- I MEAN, I CAN CHECK
THROUGH THE TRASH.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.045
- OH, BOY.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.629
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:19.713 --> 22:22.924
- NAH, I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS I'M ALL--100% WRONG.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.885
{\an8}- I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA COME IN
AND BE BOSSY

22:24.968 --> 22:25.969
{\an8}AND TRY TO TAKE
THE STEERING WHEEL FROM KYLE.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.597
HE'S DEFINITELY [bleep].

22:28.680 --> 22:31.516
[laughing] ARE YOU
SECOND-GUESSING YOUR CHOICE?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.101
- LITTLE BIT.
LITTLE BIT.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.936
- [laughs]

22:35.020 --> 22:36.313
- I AIN'T GOT 'EM, SARAH.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.939
- YOU WANNA DRAW
YOUR OWN TATTOO?

22:38.023 --> 22:38.815
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

22:38.899 --> 22:40.525
I AM NOT GETTING
A [bleep] TATTOO.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.111
{\an8}- DID KYLE NOT WATCH
THE SECOND SEASON OF <i> INK MASTER?</i>

22:43.195 --> 22:44.613
WE ALL KNOW
SARAH'S A CONTROL FREAK.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.490
DOESN'T HE KNOW WHAT
HE'S ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF INTO?

22:46.573 --> 22:48.033
- I KNEW
SHE WAS GONNA DO THAT.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.619
[both laugh]

22:50.702 --> 22:52.704
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO GIVE YOUR CANVAS

22:52.788 --> 22:56.291
A HOT PINUP
WITH SEXY PROPORTION.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.211
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS...

22:59.294 --> 23:01.671
NOW.
- [mouths]

23:01.755 --> 23:03.757
{\an8}- WE HAVE SOME KEY WORDS
IN THIS CHALLENGE:

23:03.840 --> 23:05.550
{\an8}PINUP, PROPORTION, SEXY.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.344
YOU CAN EXAGGERATE
THEIR SIZE,

23:07.427 --> 23:08.512
MAKE 'EM MORE VOLUPTUOUS,

23:08.595 --> 23:10.055
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE DONE
IN PROPORTION

23:10.138 --> 23:11.348
TO THE REST OF THE DESIGN.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.766
AND IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING
APPEALING TO LOOK AT,

23:12.849 --> 23:13.767
YOU'RE OUT.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.060
- PERFECT.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.437
THAT WORKS.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.981
- READY FOR A TATTOO?
- YEAH, YEAH.

23:20.065 --> 23:20.816
{\an8}- IF RON DOES NOT LIKE
THIS DESIGN,

23:20.899 --> 23:22.984
{\an8}HE'S GONNA WALK.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.487
I THINK THIS'LL BE COOL.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.117
- I CAN DO THAT. I WAS
[bleep] NERVOUS AS HELL, DUDE.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.202
I'M LIKE, "MAN, IF I DON'T
LIKE IT, I'M NOT GONNA GET IT."

23:32.285 --> 23:34.913
- THAT WOULD'VE SENT ME HOME IF
I DIDN'T HAVE NOBODY TO TATTOO.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.790
AND THIS MIGHT
SEND ME HOME ANYWAYS, HONESTLY,

23:36.873 --> 23:37.999
BECAUSE IT'S NEW-SCHOOL.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.459
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IT'S LIKE, "DUDE,

23:39.543 --> 23:41.711
I CAN'T LET YOU DOWN."

23:41.795 --> 23:42.963
[tattoo machine buzzing]
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.382
- ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

23:45.465 --> 23:49.386
[tattoo machines buzzing]

23:49.469 --> 23:52.430
{\an8}- HAVING A DARKER CANVAS
DOES NOT GIVE YOU

23:52.514 --> 23:54.349
{\an8}THE ABILITY TO DO
BRIGHT COLORS.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.976
I'M A COLOR SPECIALIST,

23:56.059 --> 23:58.937
SO I HOPE TO JUST
KIND OF PASS BY ON THIS ONE.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.063
- THE CANVAS,
SOMETIMES, THEY ASK FOR THINGS

24:00.147 --> 24:03.275
THAT YOU REALLY
DON'T WANNA DO.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.734
- CRAIG'S WEAKNESS
IS GRAY WASH.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.361
{\an8}AND IF YOU CAN'T
DO GRAY WASH,

24:06.444 --> 24:09.406
{\an8}YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE
AN INK MASTER.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.618
- JUST GONNA MAKE SURE THE LINES
ARE SUPER CLEAN AND TIGHT.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.871
THAT'S A NICE LINE
RIGHT THERE.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.331
{\an8}AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT
HE WAS COMFORTABLE,

24:18.415 --> 24:21.084
{\an8}HE DEFINITELY HAS SOME NERVES
AND WOBBLY LINES.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.711
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
SINGLE-PASS LINES.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.630
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE THEM LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE SINGLE-PASS.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.841
- I FEEL AS THOUGH
SARAH MIGHT BE HAPPIER

24:27.924 --> 24:29.551
WITH THE MACHINE
IN HER OWN HAND.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.594
- BALLS TO THE WALL.
GO IN.

24:30.677 --> 24:35.891
GET HER DONE.
- IT'S THROWING ME OFF MY GAME.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.894
- FOUR HOURS REMAIN.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.356
[tattoo machines buzzing]

24:43.440 --> 24:46.109
- THESE PAST FEW CHALLENGES
HAVE BEEN REALLY TOUGH.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.486
I'M JUST HAVING
A REALLY TOUGH TIME BEING HERE.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.864
- YEAH, I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING
A TATTOO, WE GOTTA LIVE WITH IT,

24:50.947 --> 24:52.115
BUT WE'RE HELPING
YOU GUYS OUT.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.576
THIS COULD EASILY HELP YOU
OR HURT YOU IN A WAY.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.912
- I WOULD REALLY HOPE
THAT THIS PINUP REDEEMS ME.

24:56.995 --> 25:01.791
THERE'S NO EXCUSE
WHY I SHOULDN'T DO WELL.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.171
{\an8}- TJ DREW OUT-OF-PROPORTION,
COMIC-BOOK-STYLE DESIGNS.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.547
SO I FIXED
THE PROPORTIONS

25:07.631 --> 25:10.759
TO MAKE IT MORE BELIEVABLE
AS A PINUP.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.344
YEAH, THIS IS DEFINITELY
COMING OUT LIKE A TATTOO

25:12.427 --> 25:14.596
THAT I WOULD DO AT HOME,
WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.890
EVERYBODY'S GONNA CALL ME OUT
FOR NOT DRAWING THIS DESIGN,

25:16.973 --> 25:18.433
BUT NOBODY'S GONNA APPRECIATE
THE FACT

25:18.516 --> 25:19.851
THAT I'M ABLE TO TAKE SOMETHING
THAT'S OUT OF PROPORTION

25:19.935 --> 25:21.603
AND PUT IT
INTO PROPORTION.

ON THE BACK SHOULDER,

BECAUSE IT'S SUCH
AN UNAPPEALING TATTOO.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.937
- THIS THING IS JUST GRAY.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.273
THESE SOLID,
DARK FIELDS OF IT DON'T DO

33:45.356 --> 33:47.108
ANYTHING FLATTERING
FOR THE WOMAN'S COMPOSITION.

33:47.191 --> 33:50.319
- SHADING VERSUS COLORING
IS [bleep] KILLING CRAIG.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.655
- HOW ABOUT BOTTOMS
IN TERMS OF POOR PROPORTION?

33:52.739 --> 33:54.115
- JOSHUA JUST LOST IT.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.744
THIS ARM TUCKED IN HER HIP
IS SO OUT OF WHACK.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.246
THE LACK OF DEPTH MAKES IT LOOK
LIKE A LITTLE MIDGET ARM.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.206
- BETWEEN JOSHUA'S FACE
AND TATU BABY'S FACE,

34:02.290 --> 34:03.291
WHICH ONE IS
MORE LIFELESS?

34:03.374 --> 34:04.959
- THEY'RE BOTH JUST--
- DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS.

34:05.042 --> 34:07.628
- AS FAR AS TATU BABY,
THIS TATTOO,

34:07.712 --> 34:08.588
SHE'S NOT SEXY.

34:08.670 --> 34:09.672
SHE'S NOT APPEALING.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.467
- SHE'S NOT COMMITTED
TO THIS COMPETITION FULLY.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.594
SHE IS OUTSIDE
OF HER COMFORT ZONE

34:14.677 --> 34:16.512
DOING THINGS THAT ARE
COMPLETELY HER STYLE.

34:16.596 --> 34:17.638
- OKAY, I'M CURIOUS
TO SEE

34:17.722 --> 34:18.931
WHAT THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
COMES UP WITH

34:19.014 --> 34:21.559
BECAUSE WE SEEM
TO BE TEETERING

34:21.641 --> 34:23.018
ON WHICH TATTOO
IS THE MOST UNAPPEALING

34:23.101 --> 34:25.146
AND WHICH ONE SHOWED
THE LEAST USE OF PROPORTION.

34:25.228 --> 34:26.313
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT TOO.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.483
{\an8}- YEAH.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.735
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO SEE
WHO HAS THE WORST TATTOO.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.904
- CRAIG DID THIS TATTOO.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.280
IT'S A LADY GETTING OFF,
HAVING AN INK-GASM.

34:34.362 --> 34:35.697
- LOOKS LIKE A LADY TAKING
A [bleep].

34:35.782 --> 34:37.658
- SHE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF A POTBELLY, DON'T YOU THINK?

34:37.742 --> 34:39.159
- I THINK THE ANATOMY
IS DEAD-ON.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.745
I WOULD LIKE SOME PARTS
TO HAVE BEEN DARKER.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.163
- THIS IS A NEW-SCHOOL ARTIST.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.748
HE KILLED THIS BLACK AND GRAY.
- HE NAILED IT.

34:44.831 --> 34:46.708
- BOTTOM LINE:
HE AIN'T GOING HOME.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.668
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.545
JOSH DID IT.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.838
- IS ANYBODY ELSE
KINDA WEIRDED OUT

34:50.922 --> 34:52.632
BY THAT SUPER SMALL
FRONT FOOT

34:52.715 --> 34:55.092
WITH THAT REALLY LONG ANKLE?

34:55.176 --> 34:56.219
- IT'S BENT REAL HARD.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.762
- THE ONLY THING THAT'D
REALLY CORRECT THAT NOW

34:57.845 --> 35:00.765
IS PUT A HANDICAP PLACARD
SOMEWHERE ON HER.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.100
YOU HANDED HIM A SOLID PIECE
TO WORK OFF OF.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.061
IF HE WOULD'VE DONE YOUR TATTOO,
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE

35:05.144 --> 35:06.938
TALKING ABOUT YOU BEING
IN THE BOTTOM.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.064
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT BOILED DOWN TO HIM

35:08.147 --> 35:09.524
NOT BEING
MENTALLY STRONG ENOUGH

35:09.607 --> 35:11.192
TO BE ABLE
TO WIPE OFF ALL THE CRITICISM

35:11.275 --> 35:12.610
HE'S BEEN GETTING
ABOUT BEING A TRACER.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.362
- BASICALLY, YOU GAVE HIM
A WINNING LOTTERY TICKET,

35:14.445 --> 35:17.490
AND HE TOOK IT
AND THREW IT AWAY.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.449
- MY ARTIST WAS JASON,

35:18.533 --> 35:20.451
AND I ASKED
FOR A NEW-SCHOOL GEISHA.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.285
THAT FOOT IS [bleep].

35:21.369 --> 35:22.787
- WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PROPORTION.

35:22.870 --> 35:23.955
YOUR FOOT DON'T SIT LIKE THAT

35:24.038 --> 35:24.664
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING
ON YOUR FEET.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.999
THAT FOOT'S LIKE...

35:27.083 --> 35:29.043
- IT'S THE PINKIE TOE ON
THE GROUND AND THE BIG TOE UP.

35:29.126 --> 35:32.046
THINK ABOUT HOW HARD
THAT WOULD BE TO ACCOMPLISH.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.214
- MAN, THIS IS NOT
A BUNK TATTOO.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.715
TJ'S DEAD-ASS BOTTOM.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.843
- TO ME,
RON'S DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A PINUP.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.010
- NO.
PROPORTION CHALLENGE--

35:38.094 --> 35:39.387
- IT WAS
A PINUP CHALLENGE TOO.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.346
- TECHNICAL PROBLEMS,
PROPORTION PROBLEMS.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.390
- IT HAD TO BE SEXY,
HAD TO BE PRETTY.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.725
- I'M SORRY, THIS IS A LITTLE
BIT CUTER THAN YOUR ONE.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.477
- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGHT
FOR MY BOY.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.895
- HE CHOSE YOU.
HE CHOSE YOUR DRAWING.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
- I AGREE, I AGREE.
- HE CHOSE YOUR IDEA.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.315
I GUESS
WE'VE REACHED A VERDICT.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.275
- YEAH.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.197
[door closes]
- AW, [bleep].

35:58.281 --> 36:00.908
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.660
WE DECIDED.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.037
WE WANNA SEE JIME...

36:05.121 --> 36:08.207
JOSHUA...

36:08.291 --> 36:11.711
CRAIG...

36:11.794 --> 36:13.838
AND TATU BABY.

36:13.921 --> 36:14.714
SEE Y'ALL DOWN
AT THE SHOP.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.258
- THEY ASKED CRAIG TO GO DOWN?
- YEAH.

36:17.341 --> 36:20.928
- [bleep].

36:21.012 --> 36:21.971
- THERE'S THREE STRONG PEOPLE
GOING DOWN.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.097
SOMEBODY'S NOT COMING BACK.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.432
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO IT IS.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.059
EVEN IF WE DON'T LIKE
EACH OTHER, IT MAKES ME SAD.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.185
- LET'S GO FACE
THE FIRING SQUAD.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.105
- [sighs]

36:34.358 --> 36:37.570
- TODAY, WE TESTED YOUR ABILITY
TO USE PROPORTION

36:37.653 --> 36:39.989
TO MAKE PINUP TATTOOS
INSANELY HOT.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.073
ONE OF YOU WOWED US,

36:41.157 --> 36:44.201
BUT THREE OF YOU
WERE LESS THAN PERFECT.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.870
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

36:45.953 --> 36:50.374
THAT THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY...

36:50.458 --> 36:52.168
GOES TO JIME.
[applause]

36:52.251 --> 36:53.628
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.296
- THE DIFFERENT TRICKS
THAT YOU PULLED OFF

36:55.379 --> 36:56.797
ARE WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR

36:56.881 --> 36:58.174
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY

36:58.257 --> 36:58.591
TO HOLD THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.385
- THANK YOU.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.305
- JOSHUA, CRAIG,
TATU BABY,

37:04.388 --> 37:05.765
YOUR GIRLS WERE
NOT SO HOT,

37:05.848 --> 37:10.228
AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE PACKING
YOUR MACHINES.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.312
JOSHUA, ONCE AGAIN,

37:11.395 --> 37:15.066
YOU ARE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

37:15.149 --> 37:19.111
VOTED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.072
- I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE,

37:21.155 --> 37:22.323
AND I HAVE TO STAND UP
FOR WHAT I DID.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.450
- THIS TATTOO JUST LOOKS
SO UNFINISHED.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.202
THE BROWN OUTLINE
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.995
IF IT'S BROWN,
WHY NOT MAKE IT BLACK?

37:28.079 --> 37:30.373
- I'VE REALLY JUST LET MYSELF
DOWN HERE BECAUSE...

37:34.835 --> 37:36.003
I FEEL LIKE
I'M DISAPPOINTING MY FAMILY.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.171
BUT THOSE ARE MY CHOICES,

37:37.254 --> 37:40.841
AND I'VE DONE THE TATTOOS
THAT I'VE DONE.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.636
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
[sniffles]

37:43.719 --> 37:46.347
[sniffles]

37:46.430 --> 37:47.348
- CRAIG.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.600
- THE TATTOO IS JUST NOT
APPEALING TO ME.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.768
- I DID MY BEST
WITH THE CANVAS

37:50.851 --> 37:51.852
AND THE PIECE
I HAD TO DO.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.771
- BUT THE SHADING,
ALL THESE LIGHT GRAYS

37:53.854 --> 37:54.689
SCRIBBLED ROUGHLY
IN HERE,

37:54.772 --> 37:56.816
IT'S KNOCKING IT DOWN
EVEN FURTHER.

37:56.899 --> 37:57.608
- TATU BABY.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.027
- THIS THING HAS
BAD PROPORTION,

38:00.111 --> 38:01.988
MISSING SHOULDER,
JACKED-UP HAND.

38:02.071 --> 38:02.989
- THIS IS BECOMING

38:03.072 --> 38:04.323
AN ALL TOO FAMILIAR SPOT
FOR YOU DOWN HERE.

38:04.407 --> 38:07.618
- I'VE BEEN HAVING
A REALLY HARD TIME PERSONALLY,

38:07.702 --> 38:09.870
SO IT'S BEEN REFLECTING
ON MY WORK.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.122
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.540
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
TATU BABY?

38:12.623 --> 38:15.167
- I'M THANKFUL FOR EVERYBODY
WHO VOTED FOR ME,

38:15.251 --> 38:18.504
BUT MY HEART AND HEAD
ARE NOT IN THIS GAME.

38:18.587 --> 38:18.963
I GOTTA DO WHAT'S RIGHT,

38:19.046 --> 38:22.758
AND I HAVE TO...

38:22.842 --> 38:24.969
GO HOME.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.931
- WOW, BABY.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.057
YOU REALLY WANNA QUIT?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.225
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL GOOD
WITH QUITTING?

38:31.308 --> 38:33.310
- I'VE NEVER, EVER GAVE UP
ON ANYTHING,

38:33.394 --> 38:34.186
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT
FOR WHAT I DO.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.896
- OKAY, BUT NOW--
- I FEEL LIKE...

38:35.980 --> 38:37.023
- HOLD ON.
- I'M SORRY.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.608
- NOW THAT YOU'VE OPENLY
ADMITTED YOUR SITUATION,

38:39.692 --> 38:41.027
CAN YOU COME OUT
OF YOUR TAILSPIN?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.111
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.780
EVERY [bleep] CHALLENGE,
IT'S LIKE, "SUCK IT UP."

38:44.864 --> 38:48.743
DEALING WITH ALL THIS STRESS,
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.995
- YOU DON'T WANNA JUST
THROW AWAY THIS OPPORTUNITY

38:51.078 --> 38:52.246
TO BE INK MASTER.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.248
I'VE HAD TO WORK SO HARD
TO GET WHERE I'M AT,

38:54.331 --> 38:56.000
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.127
IF I HAVE A OPPORTUNITY
TO REACH A PINNACLE

38:58.210 --> 39:00.254
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING
SO HARD FOR,

39:00.337 --> 39:01.505
I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING
DETER ME.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.592
IF YOU WERE ABLE
TO PUT EVERYTHING BEHIND YOU,

39:04.675 --> 39:06.218
I THINK YOU WOULD
REALLY GAIN THE RESPECT

39:06.302 --> 39:07.303
FROM YOUR PEERS
TO SEE YOU STAY HERE.

39:07.386 --> 39:11.057
- BABY, NONE OF THE FOUR OF US
ARE IN THIS ROOM

39:11.140 --> 39:12.808
BECAUSE WE WALKED AWAY
FROM ANYTHING.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.268
- I JUST--

39:14.351 --> 39:17.229
I WANNA SHOW YOU GUYS
A TATU BABY TATTOO.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.440
AND I LEAVE IT
UP TO YOU GUYS.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.901
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE TOUGHEST DECISION

39:21.984 --> 39:24.612
THAT WE'VE HAD
'CAUSE YOU SHOULD ALL GO.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.197
- WHEN I LOOK
AT THESE THREE TATTOOS,

39:26.280 --> 39:27.990
THERE'S FLAWS
IN ALL THREE OF 'EM.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.992
JOSHUA,
YOURS IS THE PRETTIEST,

39:30.076 --> 39:33.037
BUT YOU MADE
BAD DECISIONS ARTISTICALLY.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.663
TATU BABY,
ALL OF YOUR SHORTCOMINGS

39:34.747 --> 39:36.457
COULD'VE BEEN CORRECTED
WITH A SECOND LOOK

39:36.540 --> 39:39.126
ON THIS DESIGN BEFORE YOU EVEN
STARTED TATTOOING.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.878
CRAIG, MAN,
I LOOK AT YOUR TATTOO,

39:40.961 --> 39:42.129
AND IT'S JUST
NOT APPEALING.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.173
AND THEN, ONCE I GET
INTO THE TECHNICAL PART OF IT,

39:44.256 --> 39:45.674
THERE'S A LOT
OF FLAWS.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.803
THIS IS THE [bleep]
MOST DIFFICULT DECISION

39:48.886 --> 39:51.514
THAT WE'VE HAD
TO MAKE.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.517
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:58.479 --> 39:59.522
CRAIG...

39:59.605 --> 40:01.816
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.818
- CRAIG, THE ISSUE IS

40:03.901 --> 40:04.985
IF YOU CAN'T DO
BLACK AND GRAY,

40:05.069 --> 40:07.113
YOU CAN'T BE INK MASTER.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.073
IT'S YOUR ACHILLES' HEEL.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.660
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.578
- I'M PISSED OFF.
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.747
HE JUST TOLD
A REALLY TALENTED ARTIST

40:16.831 --> 40:17.832
THAT HE [bleep] UP

40:17.915 --> 40:19.166
WHEN JOSH'S ARTISTIC SKILL

40:19.250 --> 40:20.918
IS JUST NONEXISTENT.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.963
IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF BULL[bleep].

40:25.089 --> 40:27.883
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:27.967 --> 40:29.301
- OH, [bleep].

40:29.385 --> 40:33.389
- YOU MUST CARVE A DESIGN
INTO A HUMAN SKULL.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.099
- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE FUN.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.517
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
I DO IT BETTER.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.476
- I DON'T [bleep] LINES UP
OR SHADING, AND YOU DO.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.395
- I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
BETTER THAN YOU.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.396
THAT'S JUST
THE [bleep] FACT.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.940
- YOU [bleep] SUCK
AS AN ARTIST.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.693
- MY MOM GOT MONTHS LEFT,
WEEKS LEFT POSSIBLY.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.611
MY MOM'S THE BIGGEST REASON
WHY I'M HERE.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.864
I DEFINITELY
WANNA MAKE HER PROUD.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.158
- YOU JACKED IT UP.
- YOU WANNA WIN OR NOT?

40:52.241 --> 40:55.119
WHY ARE YOU IN THE BOTTOM?
BAD DECISIONS.
