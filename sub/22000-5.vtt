00:01.635 --> 00:03.535
Hey, Mr. Kim. How's it going?

00:03.704 --> 00:06.038
Ah, you know, same, same.
Nothing new.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.173
I notice you're running
a little low

00:08.175 --> 00:11.110
On my particular
brand of literature.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.013
Yeah, well, you know,
you is almost

00:14.015 --> 00:16.548
Only customer
who still buy magazine.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.217
Everybody else looking online.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.418
No, not me.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.254
Every time you log on,
they're watching you.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.623
They know every click,
every swipe.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.058
Yeah?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.794
This way, no one knows
what I'm looking at.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.330
- Except me.
- Except you.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.465
- And me.
- Oh.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.601
Hi, Mrs. Kim,
I didn't see you there.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.837
Good recipe for
lemon meringue pie, page 14.

00:40.508 --> 00:41.573
Thanks for the tip.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.343
- Okay, see you.
- Okay.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.314
You charge him for magazine
inside the magazine?

00:49.316 --> 00:51.216
Yeah, I see everything.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.619
Yeah, me, too.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.188
Because you never clear
browser history.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.798
How you clear browser history?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.788
Pink shirt? Bold choice, appa.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.624
Not pink. Salmon. Like a fish.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.759
It's a special for tonight.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.827
That's sweet.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.462
And it's definitely pink.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.796
Okay, I go change.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.864
No, you look good.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.365
I think it's really
nice that you guys

01:40.367 --> 01:41.600
Are still excited
about date night.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.668
Yeah.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.536
When umma first suggest,
I think,

01:44.538 --> 01:46.138
"eh, it's a stupid idea."

01:46.474 --> 01:48.474
Turns out, it's the best thing
for marriage.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.642
Umma, let's go!

01:51.178 --> 01:52.744
Okay. Okay.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.314
Wow, you look amazing.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.916
More amazing if I have
10 more minutes.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.218
Where are you guys going?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.519
Dancing and the driving range.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.187
- Wow, big night.
- Yeah.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.156
I go dancing,
he go driving range.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.757
Wait, you guys
aren't going out together?

02:05.759 --> 02:08.393
Yeah, I take her to bus stop.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.895
I have four
more chapters left.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.163
Bye, Janet.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.232
Uh...

02:14.768 --> 02:16.201
Yo. Ready to shoot
some hoops?

02:16.203 --> 02:17.369
Yeah, one sec.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.404
What are you doing?

02:19.406 --> 02:21.373
Oh, these shoes don't
play basketball.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.958
They're basketball shoes.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.542
You can tell by the little man
playing basketball on them.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.645
No, your shoes are
basketball shoes.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.547
My shoes are
collector's items.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.915
And I intend to
keep 'em that way.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.350
Ah, guess it will be bad
if you got

02:31.352 --> 02:32.551
Some burrito juice
on them sneaks, huh?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.652
Get that burrito away from me!

02:33.654 --> 02:35.587
Get your shoes away from
my special edition burrito.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.189
Dude, I'm not joking!

02:37.191 --> 02:38.757
These shoes,
they're my legacy.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.528
Relax. See? Done. Happy?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.396
Whoo!

02:44.398 --> 02:45.848
What the hell?

02:45.849 --> 02:47.299
That was interference.
I would have made that shot.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.734
Dude, that's burrito juice.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.402
It's like mustard,
ink and spaghetti sauce

02:50.404 --> 02:51.470
All in one.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.771
You can't even see it.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.240
It's the only thing I can see!

02:55.242 --> 02:58.343
Dude, what is your problem?
I'll get you another pair.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.612
You just can't walk in
a store and buy these.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.315
I was on a wait list
for six months!

03:03.317 --> 03:06.451
I made some great friends
on that wait list.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.920
I don't even know
how I'm gonna tell

03:07.922 --> 03:09.354
Brody and Denise!

03:09.356 --> 03:11.323
Dude, you have,
like, 40 other pairs!

03:11.325 --> 03:13.525
Of different sneakers!

03:13.527 --> 03:16.328
I can't even look at you.
Get out of my room!

03:18.966 --> 03:21.200
- You want the tide pen?
- Yes!

03:30.644 --> 03:32.311
- Hey, how was your night?
Fine.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.612
Did you have fun?

03:33.614 --> 03:36.548
So much fun
dancing all by myself.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.983
I was kind of wondering
how that worked

03:37.985 --> 03:39.952
With appa golfing.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.920
For three week,
I dancing with Mr. Gill.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.956
So light on his feet.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.891
But then his wife
fully recovered.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.292
So unlucky for me!

03:47.294 --> 03:48.760
Yeah, too bad.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.929
I guess most people
go as couples.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.332
How I am supposed to improve

03:53.334 --> 03:56.435
When every week I have
a different dance partner?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.537
Mr. Young, Mr. Wilson...

03:58.539 --> 04:00.739
Oh, Mr. Chopra, he was good.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.841
But then he have a stroke.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.744
So now he's always dancing
to the left, to the left.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.546
Sometimes I want to
dance to right side!

04:07.548 --> 04:08.880
Why don't you just ask appa?

04:08.882 --> 04:11.683
It would be nice to have
a regular dance partner.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.285
Like your husband.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.787
Appa don't like dancing.
He like golf.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.389
What about what you like?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.959
I like Mrs. Gill have shingles
just one more month.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.363
But I never get what I want.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.278
Hey, just wondering about
those month-end reports.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.613
Yeah, just working on 'em now.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.650
That is a-mall-zing.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.786
I don't know
if you've noticed,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.354
But there's a big wall
of glass between us,

04:49.356 --> 04:51.523
So I kind of know
you're shoe shopping.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.859
Oh, yeah, kind of.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.995
Hey, love me a shoe shop,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.730
But I'm wearing
the boss hat.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.267
Which means I have to tell you
no shopping during work hours.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.736
They're not for me.
They're for him.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.372
Careful. He'll destroy
everything you love.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.708
Is he okay?

05:09.710 --> 05:10.809
He was screaming
into the trunk

05:10.811 --> 05:12.311
Of a Sebring earlier.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.479
He collects sneakers
and I kind of ruined a pair.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.481
Mourning the loss
of great shoes,

05:16.483 --> 05:17.849
I know that pain.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.519
They're, like, $400.
I had no idea.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.987
I guess you've already checked

05:21.989 --> 05:24.623
Craigslist, Kijiji, eBay,
Etsy, Amazon?

05:26.694 --> 05:27.860
Just foot locker.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.027
Oh, my god!
Cancel my 3:00.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.796
I'm just kidding.
I can't cancel.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.564
It's my dentist and they've
got a very strict policy.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.367
- May I?
- Yeah. Sure. Be my guest.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.571
Okay.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.775
Mmm-hmm.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.944
Oh, no,
I do not think so, sir.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.616
And <i>voila.</i>

05:51.618 --> 05:53.618
Yeah, this is the guy, Kelly.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.088
He's close.
Shoes are in good condition.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.790
And he writes in all caps,
which means...

05:59.626 --> 06:00.726
That he's yelling?

06:00.728 --> 06:01.993
He's over 60.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.996
And maybe he's yelling.
I don't know.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.698
But I can talk him down.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.433
- Really?
- Absolutely.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.470
But not right now.
We should get back to work.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.939
I forgot
- I have my boss hat on.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.074
I'm picturing a sombrero?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.343
Close.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.548
(on PA) <i>everything you love.</i>

06:23.951 --> 06:25.016
It's date night.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.485
That's the point
of date night.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.520
People go out together
on a date.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.389
Twenty-eight year ago,
we date.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.391
Now we're married.
We stopped dating.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.059
Appa,
you know what I...

06:34.061 --> 06:35.127
You know what I...

06:35.562 --> 06:37.662
- That's not funny.
- Mmm, kind of funny.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.065
I'm serious.
Umma was really sad.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.500
It's like
you're leaving her dateless

06:41.502 --> 06:42.868
On prom night week after week.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.935
What you talking?

06:43.937 --> 06:45.170
She tell to me

06:45.172 --> 06:47.005
She don't want me
take her dancing.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.774
Clear as a bell. Bing.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.456
Uh-huh. What happened
on her last birthday?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.977
We have a good time.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.079
- And what did you get her?
- Nothing.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.680
She say
she don't want present.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.482
But what did she want?

06:57.484 --> 06:58.550
Present.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.452
See, you need to...

07:00.454 --> 07:01.520
Appa, I...

07:01.655 --> 07:02.788
huh?

07:02.790 --> 07:03.889
Appa... Ugh!

07:09.797 --> 07:10.929
Okay, all finished.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.034
So, I have to dance
with Mrs. Maggie.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.669
- Mmm.
- But she don't understand

07:17.671 --> 07:19.571
We're only counting
up to eight.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.607
She just keep going.
Nine, 10, 11, 12.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.842
Yeah, I just go
to driving range.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.910
Have no problem.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.411
- Mmm.
- Just a good time.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.047
You want the last one?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.017
- No, no, you have.
- No, I don't want.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.019
- You sure?
- Yeah.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.620
I say I don't want.

07:36.824 --> 07:37.923
Okay, I have.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.659
Mmm.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.528
Why you say you don't want
if you want?

07:43.897 --> 07:45.764
Well, I only want
if you don't want.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.898
No, you have.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.235
If you want something,
say you want.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.071
Okay, I want the last mandu.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.042
Mmm.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.078
Also, I want you
to clear table.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.646
I want you to do laundry.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.549
Okay, okay. You don't have to
say everything you want.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.851
I want you to fix faucet.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.185
I want you to stop.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.477
If all else fails

08:15.478 --> 08:16.861
And we still don't have
the price we want,

08:16.864 --> 08:17.929
We walk away.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.465
No, no, no.
We need those sneakers.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.833
You don't understand
Kimchee's collection.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.068
We can't walk away.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.705
No, we don't walk away.
We walk away.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.508
Okay, I could tell that you're
hearing a difference, but...

08:29.510 --> 08:31.510
The "walk away"
is a haggling technique.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.879
Remember my
mustard yellow leather jacket?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.780
- It's hard to forget.
- I know.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.517
When I tried it on, I said,
"mmm, definitely not me."

08:38.519 --> 08:39.751
I just walked away.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.120
The salesman thought
I was leaving, which I was,

08:42.122 --> 08:44.589
And so, bam,
he lowered the price.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.924
- So you got a deal?
- Not yet.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.025
I said, "no thank you."

08:47.027 --> 08:48.793
I started to walk away again,

08:48.795 --> 08:50.862
And he gave me
an even better price.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.848
So I just told him the truth.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.833
"Sir, this jacket is ugly
and poorly made."

08:54.835 --> 08:57.135
- But you bought the jacket.
- I know.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.172
Some deals
you just can't walk away from.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.743
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.611
I'm Shannon.
We emailed about the sneakers.

09:06.613 --> 09:07.679
Right. Right.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.615
Um... <i>Konichiwa.</i>

09:10.884 --> 09:12.817
I'm sorry.
It's the only oriental I know.

09:12.819 --> 09:13.885
Uh, come on back.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.770
Oh. Yeah, these are perfect.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.673
Ooh, they look like
they've been worn.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.975
Well, once or twice.
My son had a growth spurt.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.276
As soon as you drive a car
off the lot,

09:38.278 --> 09:39.878
It loses half its value.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.212
There was a better price
on eBay.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.582
Laceofbase86 had a good deal.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.617
Hang on.
I'll take 20 bucks off.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.885
Sounds good.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.620
Well, I know
you people like a bargain.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.722
"You people"?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.290
Downtowners.
We love a bargain. Right?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.925
No, that's not what I meant.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.027
Chinese. You like pinching
your pennies.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.862
Okay, first of all,
he's Korean.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.798
Uh, was that $20 off
we said?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.333
And secondly,
no pair of sneakers

10:01.335 --> 10:04.102
is worth doing business
with a racist.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.237
- What?
- Would you excuse us a sec?

10:08.241 --> 10:09.608
Oh, my god.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.875
I can't believe that racist.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.310
You were about to lose
my shoes.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.613
- But he's a racist.
- Okay.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.680
Right now I have a choice of

10:15.682 --> 10:17.299
Putting up
with this for five minutes,

10:17.300 --> 10:18.917
Or dealing with a hostile
roommate for months.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.019
But the things
that he's saying.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.387
What do you want me to do?
Beat him up?

10:22.389 --> 10:23.788
He's just ignorant.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.090
- Why are you defending him?
- I'm not.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.258
I just want
to take my shoes and go.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.327
Fine,
but I'm not comfortable

10:29.329 --> 10:31.396
Doing business with a racist.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.131
I have no idea
what you're saying.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.738
Well, you were right
about umma.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.008
She need a dance partner.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.810
Great. You're gonna love
dancing together.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.978
I'm not dance with her.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.313
- But you just said.
- Janet.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.715
Your appa is very brave.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.918
You remember the time
I eat 60 chicken wing?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.353
Cool hand Luke only eat 50.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.288
- I think he ate eggs.
- Yeah.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.124
Baby chicken.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.092
- I eat a full-grown chicken.
- Wings.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.895
Whose hand is cooler now, huh?

11:03.897 --> 11:06.064
What does this have to do
with dancing?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.066
I have so much courage.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.436
But dance in front of people
make me nervous.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.072
Just do it for her.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.074
Or I can take her golfing.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.709
- Problem solved.
- Appa.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.977
And a very nice dinner.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.445
Appa, go to the class.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.081
If you're nervous
I can help you.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.883
I got some moves.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.192
Janet, you're
a very good daughter,

11:34.194 --> 11:37.262
But worst dancer
in the whole family.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.384
So you're gonna go with her?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.466
Okay. Okay.
If you stop doing that.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.134
Oh, what, this?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.403
- No, other one.
- This one?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.305
No, like this.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.010
Yeah, that's not a move
I make.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.278
With the face...

11:53.280 --> 11:55.046
what is that?

12:00.253 --> 12:01.286
Yep, all good.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.821
Hey, you're feeling better,
sweetheart?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.155
Yep.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.423
Must be that time
of the month.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.859
Excuse me?

12:07.860 --> 12:09.906
Oh, come on. Give us a smile.
You'd be pretty if you smiled.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.130
"Pretty" is not exactly
what I'm going for right now.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.298
Well, mission accomplished.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.166
Okay, you know what?
We're not buying these shoes.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.234
Let's go.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.836
- Oh, come on.
- Not interested.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.870
You're right.
It's not worth it.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.938
- But you said...
- Okay, okay.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.406
- I'll take $30 off.
- We said no.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.907
I'm proud of us.
We're being the change.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.042
Exactly.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.110
Forty bucks.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.144
Got to play
to our better angels.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.812
- Yep.
- Fifty.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.990
<i>Cha-cha one. Step. Step.</i>

12:39.493 --> 12:42.227
<i>Side to side one. Forward.</i>

12:42.229 --> 12:44.195
<i>- And remember...</i>
- Forward. Back.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.296
<i>...The secret
to the cha-cha...</i>

12:45.298 --> 12:46.431
Yeah, remember.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.068
<i>...Is this place right here.
Your heart.</i>

12:50.070 --> 12:51.936
<i>- Forward. Back.</i>
- Forward.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.839
<i>- Cha-cha. Side one. Back.</i>
- Side. Cha-cha.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.509
<i>Forward. Cha-cha side one.</i>

12:57.511 --> 12:59.811
Okay, nothing to see here.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.112
<i>- Cha-cha one...</i>

13:01.982 --> 13:04.015
No, keep going.
You were looking good.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.317
- Okay, don't joke.
- Who's joking?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.888
Dancing takes time,
practice and a lot of courage.

13:09.890 --> 13:10.922
It was the hardest thing

13:10.924 --> 13:12.557
To teach ginger
next to shake a paw.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.427
Because I was thinking,
you know,

13:16.429 --> 13:17.796
Maybe by learn,

13:17.798 --> 13:20.999
I can surprise Mrs. Kim
at that dance class.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.135
That is the most romantic
thing you've ever said to me.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.071
- Now, show me what you've got.
- No.

13:27.073 --> 13:31.810
Come on, it's me, Mr. Chin.
I understand. I'll be gentle.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.046
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:36.550 --> 13:39.083
Forward, back. Side...

13:40.921 --> 13:41.986
I always forget.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.455
Forward, back, side,
I don't know.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.257
These are too many step.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.592
Keep it simple.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.196
Instead of
- forward, back, side,

13:51.198 --> 13:54.966
Try, uh, bread, milk,

13:56.136 --> 14:00.205
Gum, go to chip, pickle, chip.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.874
Go to bread.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.944
Milk. Gum.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.980
Go to chip. Pickle, chip.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.550
- Go to bread, milk, gum.
- Go to bread, milk, gum.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.587
Go to chip, pickle, chip.

14:15.589 --> 14:19.123
- Go to milk, bread, gum.
- Bread, gum.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.159
- Go to chip...
- Go to chip...

14:22.162 --> 14:25.063
- Maybe I come back later.
- No, we just, uh...

14:26.266 --> 14:29.067
Go on. I want you
to finish that sentence.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.268
What did it look like?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.904
- You really want to know?
- Okay, we stop.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.274
You think you can do better?
Prove it.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.376
I could dance circles
around both of you

14:38.378 --> 14:39.544
With my hands tied,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.279
My eyes blindfolded
and a broke foot.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.147
Okay, okay.
Here's you scratch & win.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.415
Freebie?

14:45.285 --> 14:47.318
You say nothing.
You pay nothing.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.122
This better be a winner.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.096
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.600
Uh...

15:36.202 --> 15:38.336
- What are you doing here?
- I come to dance.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.371
- What?
- Shall we?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.240
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.408
Mmm. I want to do that.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.044
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.413
Okay.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.421
- This way. Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.460
- You're not moving.
- You're not moving.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.295
That's because
you're supposed to lead.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.131
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.301
Bread, milk, gum.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.470
Go to chip. Pickle. Chip.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.486
- What are you saying?
- Stop talking.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.076
Bread. Milk. Gum. Go to chip.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.011
- Pickle...
- Why are you counting food?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.246
Sorry. Sorry.
Yeah, okay. We start again.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.082
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Come on, it's okay. Bread...

16:24.084 --> 16:25.724
<i>Yobo, yobo.</i>
It's okay. It's okay. <i>Yobo...</i>

16:27.354 --> 16:29.687
<i>Yobo...</i> Why are you here?

16:30.457 --> 16:31.956
You want me here.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.058
You just sad and lonely
on a prom night.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.095
- Who said that?
- Janet.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.663
She say I say that?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.531
She say you say
you don't want me here,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.101
But you really want
a present for your birthday.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.920
Yeah, she's right.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.205
No, no, she say you want me
come dancing with you.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.376
Why all of a sudden
you listening to her?

16:52.712 --> 16:55.279
Every time I ask,
"come dancing..."

16:55.281 --> 16:57.215
...You make that sound.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.417
I don't wanna dance
with someone

16:59.419 --> 17:00.551
Who make that sound.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.987
I don't want to
make that sound.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.158
I love you
- and I love to dance.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.161
But I don't love to dance
with you.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.364
I love watching you dance.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.533
And you love golf.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.335
Yeah. You want to come
golfing with me?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.403
See?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.638
Now you make that sound.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.608
I don't want to golf,
you don't want to dance.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.744
So there's no problem.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.579
Maybe the only problem
is Janet.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.250
Yeah, she get you to dance.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.419
Mmm. And Mr. Chin helped.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.687
Also, I stepped
on lots of bread.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.222
You have to order more.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.398
- These are amazing.
- Hey, I got my hook-ups.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.800
Best knockoffs I've ever seen.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.802
Those are not knockoffs.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.304
They're great quality.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.272
But the stitching's off,
tread pattern is wrong,

17:55.275 --> 17:56.741
And I'm pretty sure
"Air Jorgen"

17:56.743 --> 17:58.709
Never played in the NBA.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.711
Are you kidding me?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.413
How much you paid? Fifty?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.415
Sixty? Not more than 70.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.217
- No.
- -You did, didn't you?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.219
Bring it in!

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
And I can still
totally use these.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.424
To work,
to wear to play ball in,

18:13.426 --> 18:14.725
To wear in public washrooms.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.793
You know what,
I'll replace them.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.061
I said I'd do it
and I'll do it.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.362
It's okay.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.064
New pair comes out Friday.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.906
But you're gonna
wanna be in line by Wednesday.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.668
I'll bring my thermos.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.570
Oh, no liquids. Trust me.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.411
So, how did it go last night?

18:35.998 --> 18:38.415
- Janet, you're never right.
- Talk to umma.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.353
Okay, I take it
dancing didn't go well?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.088
Of course
dancing didn't go well.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.490
Appa is terrible dancer.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.358
Janet is still worse!

18:47.594 --> 18:49.393
Thanks, appa!

18:49.395 --> 18:51.162
You said
you wanted a dance partner.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.197
I do. Just not appa.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.266
We spend whole life together.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.667
We work together,
we eat together.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.202
We need apart time.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.537
A part time what?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.205
Apart time. Time apart.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.607
It'd give us
something to talk about.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.509
Yeah.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.550
You can't miss each other
if you're always together.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.313
- Okay, I go.
- Mmm.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.816
- Miss me.
- I will.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.418
- Miss me, too.
- No.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.493
Hey, so,
did Kimchee like the shoes?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.661
He loved them. Thank you.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.896
Oh, I didn't do anything.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.866
Yeah, you're probably right.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.133
I mean, I did find them,
negotiate, drive you there,

19:30.136 --> 19:31.802
And teach you
the whole "walk away,"

19:31.804 --> 19:33.538
Which is kind of
my signature move.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.839
I owe you a thank you lunch.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.141
Okay, let's do it.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.811
There it is.
The "walk away" jacket.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.813
The one and only.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.775
You know, it's really
just the color that's ugly.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.784
All I see is a good deal.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.688

Well, maybe not anyone,
but I know.
