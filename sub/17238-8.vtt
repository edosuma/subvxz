Bitter End Brandon. Last, but not least.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.125
Why don't you just hand it in now? It's good.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.500
It's probably great, right? You don't have to proof

02:21.166 --> 02:23.500
everything.

-Technically, yes you have 'til the end of the class.

02:27.792 --> 02:31.125
I said that, but I actually wrote it shorter on purpose.

02:31.166 --> 02:34.458
I need to keep going. I'm not even close to being finished.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.041

Hey

Alright.

I'm just going to grab my bag, I'm gonna wait by the door.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.625
Okay? And now we should speed it up.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.792
We still have time to get home early, okay?

02:49.834 --> 02:51.959
-No, you actually took the easiest page.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
-Okay, alright. Let's do this, let's switcheroo.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.917
Let's trade an easy page...

02:56.959 --> 02:59.542
And I'll take the hard page.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.834
Okay:Alright, thank you.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.041
We have fifteen minutes and we can have...

03:04.083 --> 03:06.333
I can beat traffic. I can get out of here.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.625
-This one's all crinkled, and I can't read it.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.959
It's very hard to read. -Well, un...Uncr...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.041
-Big mess now.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.375
-Not getting home early.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.875
-Hello, my Simon. -Ah! Oh! Mmm.

03:24.917 --> 03:27.208
Do you know what tomorrow is? -Oh, I don't know.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.417
Maybe just our five month anniversary!

03:29.458 --> 03:31.667
-You remembered! -You know I did.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.166
-That's very romantic that you remembered.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.458
-Oh, uh oh. -There's no one in the hall.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.000
-No, no, no, no. -It's...Come here.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.041
-No, no, no, no. -This is very sexy.

03:41.083 --> 03:45.083
-No, no, no, no. Just da da da da, da. Good, Sorry.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.709
-It's okay. -I just want our first kiss

03:45.125 --> 03:47.709
to be special.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.542
-Yeah, but you've been saying that for like...Months.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.834
I'm just wondering when it's going to be special enough.

03:52.875 --> 03:57.750
-Well, I don't know. Maybe after a super special dinner tomorrow

03:52.875 --> 03:57.750

04:00.792 --> 04:03.125
That sounds super special! Yeah, I can wait!

04:03.166 --> 04:06.875

04:06.917 --> 04:09.625
And some of the most succulent ceviche you've ever tasted.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.625
I'm talkin' shrimp, I'm talkin' etc.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.625

04:17.083 --> 04:19.417

04:17.083 --> 04:19.417
: Ohhh!

04:19.458 --> 04:21.709
-I'm keeping it.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.875
: Great.

04:26.917 --> 04:29.625
: That's Mary.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.834
She's subbing for a few days.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.458
-Oh my gosh! We never have hot subs!

04:34.500 --> 04:37.417
Every day I wake up, I say, I hope someone's away and

04:34.500 --> 04:37.417
we have a hot sub.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.709
Never happens. Until today. Oh boy.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.083
-Now, I swoop in and do my thing, Trudy.

04:44.125 --> 04:47.709
'Cause I'm a full time teacher and full time teachers are like

04:44.125 --> 04:47.709
celebrities to subs.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.625
-Except that you're not full-time.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.375
I come here every single day.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.375
All day.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.875
-As a sub. -Full-time sub.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.834
-Full-time whack job.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.041
: Hi Mary, I'm Gerry.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.959
Full-time sub here, heads up. So if you need anything...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.875
I'm your man. -Great, nice to meet you.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.500
-And I am a full-time guidance counsellor.

05:10.542 --> 05:14.750
-Nobody asked what you did. -Oh, well you guys are so lucky

05:10.542 --> 05:14.750
to have full time positions.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.917

05:19.917 --> 05:22.709

Frank was just telling me about the staff weekly drinks that are

05:29.250 --> 05:32.792
happening today after school.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.792
-Gerry never comes for drinks. -Normally. No.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.166

05:38.208 --> 05:42.000

05:49.917 --> 05:52.000
-He's disabled.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.875
I'm not sure there's anything going on below the waist there.

05:57.917 --> 06:01.250
Just sayin'. : Kay.

06:01.291 --> 06:04.041
: Whaddya want? -I already called dibs on that,

06:01.291 --> 06:04.041
Gerry.

06:04.083 --> 06:07.625
: Oh! Oh, you're serious. You might want

06:04.083 --> 06:07.625
to check with her first.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.792
'Cause I'm pretty sure it's a no, Frank.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.750
It's got nothing do do with the fact that you can't walk.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.917
So don't try and play that I'm being sort of insensitive to

06:11.792 --> 06:14.917
your disability.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.792
It's purely based on your height and your looks.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.125
She's a ten and you're a five.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.750
-This five's goin' into that ten, twice.

06:22.792 --> 06:25.291
What are you...?

06:25.333 --> 06:28.750
: Why the hell are there

06:25.333 --> 06:28.750
two hot subs here?

06:28.792 --> 06:32.625
-Two hot subs in one day.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.792
-Looks like we've got a bit more competition.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.750
-Looks like I have more competition. Simon.

06:36.792 --> 06:38.917

06:36.792 --> 06:38.917

06:38.959 --> 06:42.458

06:42.500 --> 06:46.917
-Well, I need you to keep hot sub Shane away from hot sub

06:42.500 --> 06:46.917

06:46.959 --> 06:50.291
-What have I said about

06:46.959 --> 06:50.291
best friend projects?

06:50.333 --> 06:53.208
-Best friends don't question best friends' projects. That

06:50.333 --> 06:53.208
makes sense.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.375
-Just do it. -It's good.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.834
Project Hot Sub is officially a go.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.125
-I just told you to watch them.

07:02.166 --> 07:04.917
And you start to leave. -I got class, Gerry.

07:04.959 --> 07:08.166
-Class is secondary to this. This is far more important.

07:04.959 --> 07:08.166
-That's more important.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.500
: Okay.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.458
I'm going to need a hot sub to watch my class while I'm

07:10.542 --> 07:13.458

07:13.500 --> 07:15.917
-Yeah, but it can't be her. -You know what that makes

07:13.500 --> 07:15.917

07:15.959 --> 07:19.375

-Nice, nice.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.959
-Hey.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.125
Well, not when you're teaching Alex McKenzie.

I swear that guy wakes up in the morning, just to ruin my day.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.792
-Rampant Reinforcement. Every day I compliment every student.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.792
-Right.

07:36.834 --> 07:40.083
-Promotes their positivity and self-esteem, makes them feel

07:36.834 --> 07:40.083

08:09.834 --> 08:14.083
giving him another second.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.875

08:21.917 --> 08:23.875
-That's just an excuse to give him an edge.

09:52.542 --> 09:56.709
French test.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.917
Don't stare at him. That's the last thing he needs right now.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.625
: Ahhh, Lori. So nosy! Brandon has a sickness.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.917
Got an anxiety disorder, he can't write tests without

10:05.667 --> 10:08.917
panicking.

10:08.959 --> 10:13.166
I'm trying to make it more comfortable for him to write a

10:08.959 --> 10:13.166
test, because he panics.

10:13.208 --> 10:17.291
And I want him to be finished quickly. Stop staring at him!

10:17.333 --> 10:20.500
You're making him feel weirder than he is.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.250
Now get to work, quietly.

10:23.834 --> 10:26.125
Oh, almost forgot.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.917
: There ya go, Brandon.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.417
-Um, Louise, you are a treat to teach.

10:36.458 --> 10:40.333
Your smile lights up this classroom everyday.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.583
Thank you. Okay.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.500
Jared, come on up here.

10:44.542 --> 10:48.041
Okay. Jared, you bring out the best in people.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.458
Your kind ways make us all better people. Thank you.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.625
Alright, who's next.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.250
Ugh...Alex, come up here.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.500

Hey Frank! -Morning Bobbi.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
-Everybody, it's Frank!

11:24.041 --> 11:26.333
: What's up? -Oh, just I need to stall.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.875
I'm doing Dwyer's Rampant Reinforcement thing.

11:28.917 --> 11:31.041
-I like the rough stuff too, but we're in school.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.458
-No, you weirdo! It's when you start the day with compliments.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.041
And then that breeds positivity and self-esteem.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.583
-That sounds really great. I'm going to try that too.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.875
-It's not as easy as it sounds, Frank. I got this one student

11:38.625 --> 11:41.875
that's like...

11:41.917 --> 11:44.208
: Miss! Are we doing this or what?!

11:44.250 --> 11:46.667
-Hold your horses Alex, I'll be right with you.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.917
This one kid...Kay...

11:48.959 --> 11:52.375

11:56.000 --> 11:58.500
: Alright, alright, alright. How's it goin' Brandon?

11:58.542 --> 12:01.041
-I'm almost finished.... -Oh, yes! Thank you!

12:03.667 --> 12:06.583
How is that possible? -It's really hard to focus in

12:03.667 --> 12:06.583
here.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.208
This is test heaven!

12:09.250 --> 12:11.959
What more could I do for you? -The waterfall is really loud.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.041
-Well then I'll turn it off. -Okay, thank you.

12:14.083 --> 12:18.458
Um and I like looking at the clock to see how long I've got

12:14.083 --> 12:18.458
left...

12:18.500 --> 12:20.917
But the flower? It's in my way and I can't.

12:20.959 --> 12:24.083
-Then move the flower! -Oh, that's a good idea, I

12:20.959 --> 12:24.083
should have thought of that.

12:24.125 --> 12:28.375
They smell

12:24.125 --> 12:28.375
like my dead grandmother.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.959
: Okay. -Which is distracting.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.375
-God rest her soul.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.542
You know, the first time she went blind...

12:38.667 --> 12:41.041
-I was scared to bother you. -You're not bothering me.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.959

12:43.000 --> 12:45.417
-Hey, Mary. -I was just going to head

12:43.000 --> 12:45.417

12:45.458 --> 12:48.000

12:50.083 --> 12:53.792
-No, that is unnecessary.

12:53.834 --> 12:58.125
-Nope, if anyone tries to buy you a drink you say "No, Gerry

12:53.834 --> 12:58.125
already bought me a drink."

12:58.166 --> 13:00.333
: Okay? -I mean, if you insist.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.333
Six dollars You know what?

13:00.375 --> 13:03.333

13:12.917 --> 13:14.542

16:02.792 --> 16:06.125
relaxing, to be honest.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.667
-It's more of a restaurant bar,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.667
really.

16:08.709 --> 16:11.333
This is more relaxing then what I set up for you at school?

16:11.375 --> 16:14.250
My mom, she likes the sauce, you know? Bit of a drinker.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.792
Kind of grew up in bars. Yeah. Hey dude.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.333
