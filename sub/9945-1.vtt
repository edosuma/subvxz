00:07.760 --> 00:10.279
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:10.280 --> 00:14.079
they were given by 'im upstairs.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.759
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.839
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:20.840 --> 00:23.519
kids needing money
or wives in your face.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.559
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:26.560 --> 00:30.559
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.239
To calm us all down
to stop us going mental.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.599
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.119
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes,

00:44.360 --> 00:46.319
you shit on our head,

00:46.320 --> 00:50.319
but you pay the taxes.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.999
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:56.040 --> 00:58.479
who'd come on your
face for the price of a beer.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.479
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.439
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:06.440 --> 01:08.759

01:36.480 --> 01:39.279

01:39.280 --> 01:41.279
This is fucking ridiculous.

(SLURPS)

01:43.440 --> 01:45.599
It's a Friday night.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.599
Oh, for fuck's...

01:52.000 --> 01:55.999
CHATTING, DANCE MUSIC

02:00.200 --> 02:01.559
MUSIC STOPS

02:01.560 --> 02:02.839
(ALL) Hey!

02:02.840 --> 02:06.359
All right, fuck the law.
You can smoke inside.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.919

02:11.920 --> 02:14.519
(MAN) Why? Why? Why would ya
go and lie to me?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.599
Listen, listen, listen....

02:15.600 --> 02:17.279
Listen, listen, listen....
No, I'm not listening!

'Look at them.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.239
Oi!

03:20.240 --> 03:23.639
This is your last fucking warning.
Get it sorted by tomorrow,

03:23.640 --> 03:25.039
or you're a dead man.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.559

Oi! Arsehole!

What was all that about?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.999
What was all that about?
Don't know. I've never
seen him before.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.279
Honest, I haven't. Some fucking
dickhead handing out death threats
to the wrong people.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.039
Oh, hello.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.359
The Ugly Police been using batons?

03:44.360 --> 03:46.639
Fuck off!

03:46.640 --> 03:48.799
Norma's doing the cake.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.839
Mm!

03:49.840 --> 03:53.839
Learnt to bake in jail, says it kept
her in tobacco the whole stretch.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.639
Yvonne's doing the curry. Lillian's
girls are making the sandwiches,

03:57.640 --> 04:00.599
and Karen's throwing
in sausage rolls and chicken wings.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.899
You should stick on a cover charge,
you might make a profit.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.619
So what time d'you
think I should arrive?

04:08.620 --> 04:10.539
I want you there at the start.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.499
Then people'll know we're together.

04:12.500 --> 04:16.099
Then people'll know we're together.
I'll be 16 and we'll be legal.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.939
Yeah,
but they'll think it started before.

04:19.940 --> 04:23.939
So what? You can't control what
other people think, so why bother?

04:25.740 --> 04:29.739
I'm not bothered.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.699
(EASTERN EUROPEAN ACCENT)
Church is strong, big numbers.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.099
Many people from
east of Europe come.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.099
EU great for Catholics.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.099
Yeah, cos that's what
the country needs,

04:42.100 --> 04:44.219
more religious fundamentalists(!)

04:44.220 --> 04:47.219
Exactly. Not weak,
like Church of England,

04:47.220 --> 04:51.219
with lady priests and embracing
of the...homosexualists.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.619
Baptism very serious business.

04:54.620 --> 04:58.619
We do understand. We take religion
very seriously. Don't we, Frank?

04:59.020 --> 05:02.899
Oh, yeah, yeah. Fish on Friday,
drink the blood of virgins,

05:02.900 --> 05:04.859
self-flagellate on a regular basis.

05:04.860 --> 05:08.099

(CLEARS THROAT)

05:09.620 --> 05:11.299
What is this?

05:11.300 --> 05:15.019
Baptismal vows I wrote myself.
We were hoping, you know,

05:15.020 --> 05:17.219
to personalise
the service a little bit.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.539
What are you?Hippy or something?

05:19.540 --> 05:22.499
No, we're not into peace,
or anything like that.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.499
Do you promise to renounce Satan,
and all his works, and all his pomp,

05:27.500 --> 05:30.419
blah, blah, blah...

05:30.420 --> 05:34.419
Do you promise to shower
this child with a rainbow of love,

05:35.900 --> 05:39.899
and sprinkle on her head
the stardust of each wondrous day?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.459
We do.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.339
Oh, very much so, we do.

BABY CRIES

05:45.460 --> 05:47.619
Excuse me, Father.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.899
She's not feeding
very well at the minute.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.899
Oh, no, please - allow me to
reluctantly drag myself away(!)

05:53.940 --> 05:57.499
Carry on, Father. It gets better.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.059
All right, settle down.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.979
You see what you're responsible for?

06:02.980 --> 06:05.579
Pope fucking Pious
Head Up His Arse in there?

06:05.580 --> 06:08.139
And you won't thank us for it,
will ya,

06:08.140 --> 06:10.459
when you'll be drinking cider on
street corners like all the rest.

06:10.460 --> 06:14.459
when you'll be drinking cider on
street corners like all the rest.
(STELLA) Would you blame me?

06:22.260 --> 06:23.419
Hello?

06:23.420 --> 06:26.179
All this crap about
showering me wi' love,

06:26.180 --> 06:29.459
it's just words to you, innit?

06:29.460 --> 06:31.099
Oh, yeah, very funny(!)

06:31.100 --> 06:34.019
Rip the piss out of
the sleep-deprived new father.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.659
The only sleep-deprivation
you've ever suffered

06:36.660 --> 06:40.179
has been caused by popping too many
E's of a night in The Jockey.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.379
Babies enter life pure,

06:43.380 --> 06:47.379
but they lose their innocence when
they're exposed to people like you.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.979
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

06:50.980 --> 06:53.339
Bit early to be mashed, innit, Dad?

06:53.340 --> 06:57.339
No. Y-Yeah.
Y-You're probably right.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.579
You ought to be sterilised,
the lot of ya.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.579
Being a parent should be
a privilege, not a right.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.539
Course it should.

07:07.540 --> 07:11.539
I-I-I'll just leave this with ya.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.179

for such blaspheming!

07:16.180 --> 07:16.939
(MONICA) But, Father!

07:16.940 --> 07:20.939
(MONICA) But, Father!
No buts. My decision is made.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.139
Absolutely not.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.539
No personal vows, tradition only.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.459
But, Father...!

07:29.460 --> 07:30.899
But, Father...!
And think very carefully.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.179
Not every Tom, Dick and
Jerry can be godfather.

07:33.180 --> 07:37.099
Not every Tom, Dick and
Jerry can be godfather.
I could be godfather!

07:37.100 --> 07:39.899
It's like communism
never fucking happened.

07:39.900 --> 07:43.499
Frank?

07:43.500 --> 07:47.219
Yeah... What? Yeah. W-What?

07:47.220 --> 07:49.939
Our baby,
growing inside your belly.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.779
We'll even have a picture
after today, won't we?

07:52.780 --> 07:54.299
It's only a scan, Shane.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.819
It's like an X-ray of a peanut.

07:56.820 --> 08:00.819
Tell you whatismiraculous though,
I've got piles already.

08:01.260 --> 08:04.499
God knows what they'll be like
when I'm the size of a gable-end.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.139
I'm sure your tits
are getting bigger.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.819
I'm sure your tits
are getting bigger.
Easy, tiger!

08:07.820 --> 08:11.339
Your 10.30's in, love. I should be
charging you ground rent.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.459
I'm security.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.059
With a face like that,
you should beinsecurity.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.379
With a face like that,
you should beinsecurity.
Best make myself scarce, then.

08:17.380 --> 08:20.899
Come on, Shane,
we've talked about this.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.779
They pay extra cos I'm up the duff.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.099
We'll need the cash.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.139
You and this baby mean
everything to me, to all of us.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.739
I know.
I'll see you later for the scan.

08:29.740 --> 08:33.379
OK.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.359
(STELLA) There's been a mistake.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.519
I shouldn't be with you and her.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.519
Look at the pair of ya.
This estate, what chance have I got?

08:43.080 --> 08:44.839
The same as anybody else.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.079
Exactly - none.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.999
Oh, no, please don't say that!

08:49.000 --> 08:52.159
What, you can hear her as well?

08:52.160 --> 08:53.679
Of course I can.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.559
I'm her mother.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.839
Well, thank you very much
for fucking sharing.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.079
I thought I was going off my dinger!

09:02.080 --> 09:04.319
I thought I was going off my dinger!
Well, what was I supposed to say?!

09:04.320 --> 09:06.879
"Oh, hello. Sorry, Frank,
but I'm communing

09:06.880 --> 09:09.199
"with the spirit of
Caspar the Grumpy Baby?"

09:09.200 --> 09:10.239
I'm a listener.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.479
Only when you're not talking.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.599
Only when you're not talking.
You talk all the fucking...

09:12.600 --> 09:16.599
Only when you're not talking.
You talk all the fucking...
Oi, role models!
Stop arguing for two minutes.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.519
The deal's off.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.879
I'm not feeding, I'm not sleeping.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.879
I'm just gonna...go.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.719
Oi, nip it, you!

09:27.720 --> 09:30.039
You're upsetting your mother.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.799
She carried you around
for nine months, didn't she?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.679
All right, fair point.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.639
She did manage to stay off
the pills and the booze...mostly.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.559
Tell you what, you find me
five good men on the Chatsworth,

09:42.560 --> 09:45.479
show that there's something
decent about the place

09:45.480 --> 09:49.479
and I'll stick around, give it a go.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.639
Well, how do we prove that? You want
signed confirmation, or what?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.959
Hello?! I'm trying to establish
the rules of the game here.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.319
She's been doing this for days,
talking, then going quiet.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.599
All right, all right.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.599
Five good men - or women, I presume -
on the Chatsworth? No sweat.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.519
Salt of the earth, round here.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.999
It's hardly a curry, Debbie,
without garam masala.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.119
Just a bit of cardamom and chilli.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.719
I know, but our toilet was
like Piccadilly on a Saturday
for two days after.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.719
All right.
I'll keep it mild.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.919
Something else?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.919
Something else?
No.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.799
Everything all right, Tom?

10:36.800 --> 10:40.159
Yeah, just the new
Community Initiative.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.279
No trouble in the precinct?

10:42.280 --> 10:43.559
No, it's been dead.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.959
Stan didn't say owt
about a new initiative.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.359
No, it's a secret. No-one knows.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.359
You're Debbie Gallagher, aren't you?

10:49.360 --> 10:51.319
You're Debbie Gallagher, aren't you?
That's right.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.199
Didn't I hear that you've got
a birthday coming up?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.679
Didn't I hear that you've got
a birthday coming up?
My sixteenth.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.679
What you doing? I know that you go
out with each other. Stan told me.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.719
What?

11:01.720 --> 11:02.919
He's my partner, Tom.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.719
We tell each other everything.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.719
This is so embarrassing.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.519
Debbie, wait!

11:14.520 --> 11:16.639
That was so humiliating.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.719
I know.
I thought we could trust Stan.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.719
That's not the point. It's bizarre,
pretending we don't know each other.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.079
If Yvonne knows,
everyone probably does.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.279
Trust me, it'll be worth it,
they'll be off our backs.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.439
Trust me, it'll be worth it,
they'll be off our backs.
No-one is on our backs, Tom.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.279
Love's young dream!

12:02.640 --> 12:05.119
Are you determined to become
a human punchbag, or what?

12:05.120 --> 12:08.359
Are you determined to become
a human punchbag, or what?
Sorry. I weren't paying attention.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.799
You don't look right good, mate.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.239
You don't look right good, mate.
Just a little freaked out
from last night.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.479
Want me to see what I can find out?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.079
Want me to see what I can find out?
No, leave it. It's not worth it.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.039
You don't have to pay me
or owt like that.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.039
I could do with t' practice.

12:19.040 --> 12:23.039
I could do with t' practice.
Nah. Cheers, though.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.039
What's the wood for?

12:26.040 --> 12:30.039
It's a secret project. For Kelly.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.399
Ian!

12:38.400 --> 12:38.919
It's not him!

12:38.920 --> 12:39.799
It's not him!
What?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.879
It's not him!
What?
It's the wrong fucking geezer.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.879
How is that red hair?!

12:55.040 --> 12:57.039
Shit!

13:01.520 --> 13:05.519
I came as soon as I heard.
I've had me mobile off all day.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.759
Oh, my God. He's in a coma!

13:07.760 --> 13:11.759
No, he's not. They put him to sleep,
to help his body get over the shock.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.359
He had a miraculous escape.No
broken bones or internal bleeding,

13:15.360 --> 13:16.519
just stitches.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.639
Was it the guy who
nutted him outside The Jockey?

13:19.640 --> 13:20.679
I got the plate.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.799
We don't want any trouble.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.799
No. I'll just have a little chat
with him about the Highway Code.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.079
Ian, love.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.639
How d'you feel?

13:32.640 --> 13:34.479
Ian, son,

13:34.480 --> 13:38.479
it's me, your adoptive father.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.879
Can you talk?

13:40.880 --> 13:44.879
Liam, get a doctor.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.959
Ian, say something.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.439
Yeah, you're freaking us out.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.439
Who the fuck's Ian?

14:00.160 --> 14:04.159
I should be so lucky,
lucky, lucky, lucky...

14:04.840 --> 14:08.479
After ten o'clock, put 5p on a packet
of 10, 10p on a packet of 20...

14:08.480 --> 14:12.159
Hope you're hungry.
Nothing like a tea-time fry-up.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.039
Something wrong?

14:14.040 --> 14:15.879
It's just we're fasting, Stan.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.079
It's not Ramadan.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.719
It's not Ramadan.
It's Sawm.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.839
We do it every year for a week.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.479
It don't matter. We're not
looking to impose.No.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.479
I'll do it as well. We're a family
unit. Got to support each other.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.759
For fuck's sake, Shane!

14:37.440 --> 14:41.439
Twenty a day. Trying to keep the baby
small, cos I'm too posh to push.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.479
'What team do you support?'

14:47.480 --> 14:48.639
I don't know.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.759
United.City.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.759
Maybe something more cultural.
Erm...

14:54.080 --> 14:57.759
What's your favourite uniform,
firefighter or Household Cavalry?

14:57.760 --> 15:00.999
Yeah, something a bit closer to home.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.079
Do you remember your
middle name, son?

15:03.080 --> 15:06.399
That's a trick question.
He hasn't got one.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.599
We didn't give him a middle name?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.999
Fuck, how poor were we?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.519
Why aren't you dressed?

15:11.520 --> 15:14.999
There's nothing wrong with you,
bar a few stitches.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.759
We've had worse playground
accidents.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.679
We've had worse playground
accidents.
But he hasn't got a memory.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.439
I don't remember Saturday night,
but you don't see me hogging a bed.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.919
Come on! Chop chop! If you want
R&R, check into The Priory.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.719
Oh yeah! You'd love that!

15:27.720 --> 15:31.599
Clear the wards, replace them
with high-priced rehabilitation

15:31.600 --> 15:33.599
for the working classes, which...

15:33.600 --> 15:36.359
Yeah, whatever.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.839
Give him his clothes.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.719
He hasn't got any.
They cut them off him.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.279
He hasn't got any.
They cut them off him.
Didn't you bring any spare?

15:40.280 --> 15:41.439
Did you?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.839
You know what the weirdest thing is?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.959
I don't know any of you.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.679
Don't know who my mates are.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.679
Couldn't even say if I
had a girlfriend or not.

15:57.880 --> 15:58.879
We'll have to tell him.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.999
We'll have to tell him.
No, we don't.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.119
This could be a second chance.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.119
This could be a second chance.
Second chance for what?

16:03.120 --> 16:06.279
Not to be a poof. He might
not remember he fancies blokes.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.279
It's not a choice, it's part of you,
like the colour of your eyes, or...

16:11.360 --> 16:13.559
Your favourite curry or something.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.519
Mum, you know when you was a dyke?
Did you choose it,

16:16.520 --> 16:18.319
or was it in your genes.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.959
Ah, discussing the
girlfriend problem, are we?

16:20.960 --> 16:24.959
Well, I've no idea how you
tell someone they're too Plug

16:25.240 --> 16:27.479
to have ever had a bird.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.159
I suggest

16:29.160 --> 16:32.799
we keep it between ourselves,
shall we?

16:32.800 --> 16:36.519
Oh, look at you!

16:36.520 --> 16:37.919
He looks like an old man.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.839
Who give you that shirt?Oxfam?!

16:39.840 --> 16:43.079
I don't give a toss.
Get here in 20 minutes.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.279
Terrible thing, amnesia.
Imagine not being able to

16:46.280 --> 16:50.279
remember your loved ones,
or what kind of pies you like.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.079
He might be fine,
back to normal.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.479
Not with brain injuries.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.919
They can completely
change your character.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.439
I'm so sorry. I've been
looking for you everywhere.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.159
I went to hospital
with Ian Gallagher.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.239
I went to hospital
with Ian Gallagher.
We heard.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.519
How is he?

17:04.520 --> 17:06.358
He don't know if it's
Christmas or Crackerjack.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.358
He don't know if it's
Christmas or Crackerjack.
Crackerjack!

17:11.599 --> 17:12.919
Well?

17:12.920 --> 17:14.118
What?

17:14.119 --> 17:16.959
The scan.
I want to see a picture of the baby.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.398
They didn't do it. Needs
two of you there. I'm tired

17:20.400 --> 17:24.398
And what's wi' sawdust?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.079
Terrible thing, amnesia.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.799
Imagine not being able to
remember your loved ones,

17:32.800 --> 17:36.799
or what kind of pies you like.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.719
Easy! Stitches!

17:45.720 --> 17:48.079
Sorry. I'm Mandy,

17:48.080 --> 17:49.759
your brother's ex-partner,

17:49.760 --> 17:52.439
mother of your niece.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.439
And mate.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.959
I'm gonna have to start
writing this down.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.959
This is the kitchen.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.279
And this is the kettle.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.199
I know what stuff is.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.199
Listen. I'm shattered
and I wouldn't mind a kip.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.079
Of course, love.
Well, show him his room, then.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.159
Get him some clothes. It's his memory
he's lost, not his fashion sense.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.759
Get him some clothes. It's his memory
he's lost, not his fashion sense.
I've got some magazines to show you.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.279
Not the ones with the animals.
Don't wanna confuse him.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.079
Did the baby feed?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.879
Not a drop.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.999
Been upstairs a couple of hours.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.199
I've checked on her, but
she's just lying there awake.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.119
How 'bout her?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.319
She's all right.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.759
Or her?

18:37.760 --> 18:41.759
Look, just give us a rest, will you?

18:58.240 --> 18:59.759
Franny Gower?

18:59.760 --> 19:03.759
Boiled his neighbour's parrot on
the stove. Said it were abusive.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.839
Xavier O'Neill?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.759
Cut his mother up in the bath.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.759
What about old Aggie Palmer? Nobody's
ever had a bad word to say about her.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.599
They kicked her out
the sheltered housing.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.799
Turned out she never needed
that wheelchair.Fuck!

19:18.800 --> 19:20.279
There must be somebody!

19:20.280 --> 19:22.479
I mean good's a relative concept.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.479
So if we could get her to be
more specific, or lower the number.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.719
'Fine. One good person.
Not five. One.

19:30.720 --> 19:34.439
'That's all you need to find and
you'll be up shit creek with that.'

19:34.440 --> 19:38.439
Hey, language! No swearing before
you're six months. She's right.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.879
What does "good" mean?

19:41.880 --> 19:45.799
One person's good man
is another person's arsehole.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.999
Look at Terry Waite. Moaning bastard.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.319
'Tick, tock...'

19:49.320 --> 19:50.839
It's not a game!

19:50.840 --> 19:52.759
'Tick, tock, tick...'

19:52.760 --> 19:56.439
Eh! Alexander the Great ruled half
of Asia by the time he was your age.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.119
Stop wasting your mystical,

19:59.120 --> 20:03.119
fucking talking baby
powers tormenting us!

20:03.360 --> 20:04.719
What you doing?

20:04.720 --> 20:07.559
New parenting
technique, all the rage.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.559
Compare your baby to figures from
history. It helps them be achievers.

20:12.120 --> 20:16.119
We're off out.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.519
How are you feeling?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.679
Fine.Norma.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.879
Live in the Dormobile out back.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.279
Why?

20:26.280 --> 20:30.279
Oh, this should be good.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.879
Oh, hi.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.999
MUSIC

20:58.760 --> 21:01.439
Anyone there? Please let me out!

21:01.440 --> 21:05.439
Let me out. It wasn't me.
You've got the wrong man.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.719
Honestly, it wasn't me.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.599
How d'you get on?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.679
Fuck all.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.279
What?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.999
What?
You?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.999
(SIGHS)

21:22.800 --> 21:24.239
I know!

21:24.240 --> 21:27.599
Old Harry. He ran the
Scouts and the Boys' Club.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.519
Harry, Lollipop Man.Yeah.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.479
OBE!

21:32.480 --> 21:33.879
Would you like a sweetie?

21:33.880 --> 21:36.839
Oh, for fuck's sake!

21:36.840 --> 21:40.839
Thanks a fucking bunch, Harry.
You were my safe bet.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.079
Hiya, Carl.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.679
You all right?

21:52.680 --> 21:55.079
You're popular.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.079
Patsy Bell. Gave four of us a seeing
to last summer, behind the Reccy.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.799
Not as popular as you.
You're a right shagger.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.359
The girls round
here are totally into you.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.039
Surprised you're not
a Dad ten times over.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.719
Bollocks.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.319
Lick it, you buy it. All right?!

22:12.320 --> 22:15.879
Like her.
She was mad into you for ages.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.039
Husband left cos of it.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.199
Did we...?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.599
Yeah, all the time.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.399
Hiya, love. How's your head?

22:23.400 --> 22:24.919
Cool.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.119
Just getting back to myself.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.399
Just gonna go for a walk.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.559
Maybe once I'm back
on my feet,

22:34.560 --> 22:38.559
we can... spend some
time together.

22:39.800 --> 22:43.799
Whatever it is you've been
saying to him, pack it in!

22:48.160 --> 22:50.959
What you doing?

22:50.960 --> 22:52.599
Nothing.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.999
Not cruising for company, are ya?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.359
Not got an itch to scratch?

22:57.360 --> 23:00.159
No.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.119
You're a homo.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.119
What?

23:05.120 --> 23:08.839
A homosexual. A man
who fancies other men...

23:08.840 --> 23:10.919
Yeah, I know what a homosexual is.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.919
Well, that's you.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.119
You're full of shit.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.599
It's true!

23:18.600 --> 23:20.319
You were one even before I was.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.319
Well, before I admitted it.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.159
So, how come I've
shagged all those women?

23:25.160 --> 23:26.359
What women?

23:26.360 --> 23:28.759
The one at the shop,
she were one of them.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.359
I saw her a minute ago.
She was totally into me.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.279
Who? Yvonne?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.879
Who? Yvonne?
Yeah.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.119
You never shagged her.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.919
You shagged her husband.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.999
You're sick.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.839
You did!

23:44.840 --> 23:47.359
And you loved him.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.359
And his name was Kash.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.199
Have you got a pink car?

23:59.200 --> 24:03.199
Have you got a pink car?
You're remembering.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.099
What you doing?

24:15.100 --> 24:19.099
Taking in the air.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.299
Has it all coming flooding back?

24:23.300 --> 24:27.299
Not really.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.219
A bit.

24:30.220 --> 24:34.059
It's bizarre,
I keep getting this feeling,

24:34.060 --> 24:37.059
I don't know if I'm happy
or if I'm not.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.659
Nobody's happy.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.139
It's only in retrospect,
looking back, you think

24:42.140 --> 24:43.819
"Fuck, that was a good time."

24:43.820 --> 24:47.819
So, how do I know if I'm doing
the right thing, with my life?

24:47.940 --> 24:49.379
Do I look like Oprah?

24:49.380 --> 24:53.379
Who?

24:53.460 --> 24:55.659
Just follow your gut,
see where it takes you.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.659
Is that what you did?

25:00.380 --> 25:04.379
I have the face I deserve son,
make your own judgement.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.419
What does that mean?

25:08.420 --> 25:12.419
Fucked if I know.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.659
You've got to show support.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.339
I mean, Yvonne's great.

25:20.340 --> 25:23.419
Never been any pressure
for me to convert or anything.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.979
It's the least I can do.

25:25.980 --> 25:29.019
And besides, it's got to stand
me in good stead, hasn't it?

25:29.020 --> 25:31.419
Brownie points in the...
personal stakes.

25:31.420 --> 25:34.619
What, sex?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.699
No monkey business
during fasting, Stanley.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.659
Didn't she tell ya?

25:39.660 --> 25:43.539
It's about self-control, patience,

25:43.540 --> 25:47.539
atonement for us faults and
misdeeds, cleansing your inner soul.

25:48.900 --> 25:52.899
I gave up chocolate for Lent
16 years running, but no sex?

25:53.060 --> 25:56.019
The whole point of being
in a relationship is that...

25:56.020 --> 25:57.299
It'll be worth it, Stan,

25:57.300 --> 26:01.139
you'll feel better about
yourself, and you'll have
earned it when it comes.

26:01.140 --> 26:03.779
What?

26:03.780 --> 26:06.819
The food, or the other?

26:06.820 --> 26:08.459
Both.

26:08.460 --> 26:12.459
At the same time?

26:14.860 --> 26:18.859
What's the big mystery?

26:19.100 --> 26:21.379
Did somebody die?

26:21.380 --> 26:24.459
Just, er, sit down.

26:24.460 --> 26:28.419
This is Caley Quigley,
she's an Aislingeach.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.459
I'm sorry, I'm none the wiser.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.459
A Dreamer, an Irish visionary.

26:33.460 --> 26:36.179
She sees things other people can't.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.179
Still don't get it.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.339
She can tell us about the baby,

26:39.340 --> 26:43.339
if he's healthy, and happy
and what sex he might be.

26:43.860 --> 26:46.579
And all she'll have to do
is put her hands on your belly.

26:46.580 --> 26:49.179
She will fucking not!

26:49.180 --> 26:51.619
Wait,
Kel, come on this is important.

26:51.620 --> 26:54.939
Her mother was an Aislingeach,
and her grandmother before that.

26:54.940 --> 26:57.939
Caley has dreamt of every
child born into this family.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.299
Her hands know my womb
better than I know it meself.

27:01.300 --> 27:05.299
Please.

27:08.380 --> 27:12.379
Fine.

27:16.740 --> 27:20.739
Grope away.

27:21.980 --> 27:23.819
Relax.

27:23.820 --> 27:26.819
You'll probably feel
a wee tingling go through you,

27:26.820 --> 27:30.819
but it's nothing
to be alarmed about.

27:31.700 --> 27:35.659
It's very early in the pregnancy.

27:35.660 --> 27:39.659
If I could just...

27:48.900 --> 27:52.739
I see a boy.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.459
A big, healthy, hairy, boy.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.139
I knew it! >

27:57.140 --> 28:01.139
The seed of my son is strong!

28:10.340 --> 28:14.339
I am so tired me eyeballs feel like
they've been dipped in vinegar.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.259
D'you think we're sick?

28:18.260 --> 28:21.659
That's not easy to say.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.579
Some people think you're
born with it, others think

28:24.580 --> 28:26.539
that it's nurture over nature.

28:26.540 --> 28:30.539
With you, being a dyke was more
lifestyle choice, wasn't it?

28:32.180 --> 28:34.219
I'm not talking about Norma
and me,

28:34.220 --> 28:36.139
I'm talking about us.

28:36.140 --> 28:40.139
Our daughter's talking to us,
through some sort of baby telepathy.

28:40.220 --> 28:44.219
I think it means
we are good parents.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.459
I feel...

28:48.460 --> 28:51.859
that I have a particularly
strong bond with her.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.859
So, er, what's her middle name?

28:54.860 --> 28:58.859
It's something weird, in't it?

28:58.980 --> 29:02.659
Brian?

29:02.660 --> 29:06.659
Mum, she's freaking me out,
she keeps staring all the time.

29:08.820 --> 29:12.379
Iana.

29:12.380 --> 29:16.379
Her middle name's Iana.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.579
Think I prefer Brian.

29:20.580 --> 29:24.179
Jamie, get yourself
into that dusky cellar,

29:24.180 --> 29:26.059
and remove a crate
of your finest champagne

29:26.060 --> 29:27.979
and none of your
sparkling wine shite.

29:27.980 --> 29:28.739
What's the occasion?

29:28.740 --> 29:32.739
It's a boy.
A healthy, bouncing, baby boy.

29:32.860 --> 29:33.779
You're looking well on it.

29:33.780 --> 29:35.139
How far gone are you?

29:35.140 --> 29:36.339
Thirteen weeks.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.379
Caley Quigley were over
and everything

29:38.380 --> 29:40.539
is exactly as it should be.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.219
Well, congratulations again, Debbie.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.299
I, I better be going.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.099
Nonsense, you're going nowhere.

29:47.100 --> 29:50.499
Get yourself and this lovely
girlfriend of yours a drink on me.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.939
In fact, drinks all round.

29:52.940 --> 29:54.299
She's not my girlfriend.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.339
Of course she is.
You've been seeing each other for...

29:57.340 --> 30:00.219
For months. What are you doing?

30:00.220 --> 30:04.219
Oh, my God.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.539
Does everybody know?

30:13.540 --> 30:14.699
It seems like it.

30:14.700 --> 30:17.539
Well, this is a disaster.

30:17.540 --> 30:21.499
You're only concerned with
what other people think.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.259
We've only been going
out a few months.

30:23.260 --> 30:26.499
It should be young
and carefree and fun.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.819
It is fun.

30:27.820 --> 30:31.819
When was the last time you
surprised me, did something wild?

30:31.900 --> 30:34.339
I do wild things.

30:34.340 --> 30:35.579
No, you don't.

30:35.580 --> 30:38.699
You act like you're...

30:38.700 --> 30:39.979
old.

30:39.980 --> 30:43.979
VOICE OVER THE RADIO

30:47.540 --> 30:50.219
I have to go.

30:50.220 --> 30:54.219
Thanks, doctor.

30:54.460 --> 30:57.459
That was about as useful
as an echo in a coffin.

30:57.460 --> 31:01.459
He says there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.819
We could always take her to casualty.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.019
What, on a weekend,
in the Chatsworth?

31:06.020 --> 31:07.819
She's really still.

31:07.820 --> 31:11.819
Her eyes don't even
follow you when you move.

31:12.140 --> 31:15.659
'You couldn't find one, could ya?

31:15.660 --> 31:19.219
'Not one good person
on this whole estate.'

31:19.220 --> 31:21.259
We're still trying.

31:21.260 --> 31:25.019
'Don't waste your time. I'll
be gone, and we can all move on.'

31:25.020 --> 31:27.659
Why don't you have a little milk

31:27.660 --> 31:30.019
and then a nap, and we can
carry on looking tomorrow?

31:30.020 --> 31:31.939
Why are you saying stuff to her?

31:31.940 --> 31:35.939
We're communicating, son.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.139
Just...just listen.

31:38.140 --> 31:42.099
'It's nothing personal, you know?
I don't hate you. It's just...

31:42.100 --> 31:43.699
'I'd hoped for more.'

31:43.700 --> 31:47.699
Will you try, baby?

31:49.060 --> 31:50.619
Talk to us, sweetheart.

31:50.620 --> 31:54.219
Whatever it is...

31:54.220 --> 31:58.219
..I promise too.

32:20.740 --> 32:23.219
Anything?

32:23.220 --> 32:25.939
I'm sorry if I hurt ya.

32:25.940 --> 32:27.939
It were a long time ago.

32:27.940 --> 32:31.939
And you were... you are a good lad.

32:33.220 --> 32:36.179
Weren't down to you.

32:36.180 --> 32:38.379
Doesn't look like
the venue for the high point

32:38.380 --> 32:39.979
in anybody's life though.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.259
Were it?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.779
I can remember it.

32:42.780 --> 32:46.779
Ian,
stop reminiscing and come with me.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.459
Shane got the licence plate.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.379
Couple of phone calls.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.739
Present from the family.

32:58.740 --> 32:59.859
What am I supposed to do with them?

32:59.860 --> 33:03.859
Anything,they tried to kill you.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.019
Which one first?
Left or right?

33:07.020 --> 33:07.499
What?

33:07.500 --> 33:09.819
You know, eeny-meeny-miney-moe.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.819
No.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.459
I can do 'em, if it bothers you?

33:12.460 --> 33:14.899
Me Dad and Shane normally
do this sort of stuff,

33:14.900 --> 33:16.659
but how hard can it be?

33:16.660 --> 33:17.739
No, I mean...

33:17.740 --> 33:19.819
I might not know who I am,

33:19.820 --> 33:21.819
but I know I'd rather
fuck them than chop 'em up.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.699
What?

33:23.700 --> 33:25.459
Is this what my life's been like?

33:25.460 --> 33:27.979
Sneaking around,
scared to tell anyone I'm gay,

33:27.980 --> 33:29.899
but happy to
get involved in murder?

33:29.900 --> 33:33.659
No, not the murder bit.
We mainly keep that in the family.

33:33.660 --> 33:36.619
I don't want this, Micky.

33:36.620 --> 33:38.259
Why would I want to remember this?

33:38.260 --> 33:39.819
But they're hoodlums.

33:39.820 --> 33:41.859
Not them, everything.

33:41.860 --> 33:45.859
All of it.
My whole fucking so-called life.

33:46.820 --> 33:50.259
Ian!

33:50.260 --> 33:52.259
Hello?

33:54.620 --> 33:57.819
Please, baby, please.

33:57.820 --> 34:01.819
You're mother's in there throwing up
rings round herself with worry.

34:02.060 --> 34:06.059
We'll try, we will try.

34:06.060 --> 34:08.899
I mean we've been trying...

34:08.900 --> 34:12.739
Please, please, please...

34:12.739 --> 34:14.579
♪ Don't go breaking my heart

34:14.580 --> 34:17.259
♪ I won't go breaking your heart

34:17.260 --> 34:20.059
♪ Don't go breaking my heart

34:20.060 --> 34:24.059
♪ I won't go breaking your heart... ♪

34:37.820 --> 34:39.699
If I could have your attention.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.498
Sorry for interrupting
your drinking,

34:41.500 --> 34:45.498
but I'd like you to join me
in extending your best wishes
to the Birthday Girl...

34:47.420 --> 34:51.059
and my girlfriend, Debbie Gallagher.

34:51.060 --> 34:55.059
CHEERING

34:55.980 --> 34:58.139
Time to open the gifts, I think...

34:58.140 --> 35:02.139
me first.

35:03.380 --> 35:04.619
For fuck's sake, hurry up!

35:04.620 --> 35:08.619
Go on.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.379
It's a key to our flat.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.939
I put down a deposit this evening.

35:16.940 --> 35:20.939
Who says I can't be wild, eh?

35:21.900 --> 35:25.539
Say something.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.539
I don't want to live with you, Tom.

35:37.940 --> 35:41.939
Debbie, wait!

35:45.380 --> 35:46.939
What do you mean
you don't want to live with me?

35:46.940 --> 35:48.579
What made you think I would?

35:48.580 --> 35:49.939
Well, you love me, don't you?

35:49.940 --> 35:52.939
Of course I do.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.939
But I'm not ready for that
commitment.

35:54.940 --> 35:57.579
How am I supposed to know
what you want, Debbie?

35:57.580 --> 36:00.579
You know, do something wild,
surprise me, you said.

36:00.580 --> 36:01.419
Yeah, but not like this.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.219
Then like what?

36:04.220 --> 36:08.219
It's like dealing
with a child sometimes.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.619
I don't, I don't mean that.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.659
Well, I do...

36:13.660 --> 36:15.299
A bit.

36:15.300 --> 36:19.299
You want to be wild and carefree
and passionate and unpredictable,
fine.

36:19.980 --> 36:23.739
But I've got a job
and concerns and responsibilities.

36:23.740 --> 36:27.619
Now you can laugh at me for
trying to get us off on a respectable

36:27.620 --> 36:30.739
footing with the people who live
round here, but one of us has to.

36:30.740 --> 36:31.819
I'm 16.

36:31.820 --> 36:35.179
I don't care about
being respectable.

36:35.180 --> 36:37.219
Well, I do.

36:37.220 --> 36:39.059
I've never had it.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.299
I never grew up with a family.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.179
You want to wing it
and be a teenager, I don't.

36:44.180 --> 36:47.419
I've been there, and truth be told,
I didn't really enjoy it

36:47.420 --> 36:51.219
the first time round.

36:51.220 --> 36:55.219
So, what do we do?

36:55.500 --> 36:59.499
I don't think I even have to say it.

37:03.700 --> 37:07.699
No, don't follow me.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.339
Come wi' me.

37:21.340 --> 37:25.339
Since when did you turn into
an international man o' mystery?

37:26.660 --> 37:30.179
I don't know if I can take
any more surprises, Shane.

37:30.180 --> 37:31.379
Come on.

37:31.380 --> 37:34.619
Jamie!

37:34.620 --> 37:37.219
This is why all the sawdust.

37:37.220 --> 37:41.219
Inside of my mouth's been like
a butcher's floor
for the past few days.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.139
Da-da.

37:46.140 --> 37:50.139
I wanted to build him one meself,
before anybody bought him one.
It needs a...

37:51.580 --> 37:55.579
I'm not pregnant, Shane.

37:56.220 --> 37:59.819
It's a pseudocyesis,

37:59.820 --> 38:03.339
a phantom pregnancy...
like hysterics get.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.179
What about the dream?

38:05.180 --> 38:09.179
She must have been dreaming about
somebody else. I had the scan, Shane.

38:11.420 --> 38:15.339
Here's the baby.

38:15.340 --> 38:17.339
It's non existent, Shane.

38:17.340 --> 38:20.579
It's an empty fucking space.

38:20.580 --> 38:23.899
Seems I'm having some kind
of breakdown.

38:23.900 --> 38:27.899
I either want a baby too much,
or I don't want one at all,
they can't tell me.

38:28.420 --> 38:32.419
All they do know is,
my fucking stupid body made it up,

38:32.540 --> 38:36.539
so I'm sorry, but I can't give you
a son, or a daughter, or anything.

38:37.380 --> 38:40.179
No, don't touch me.

38:40.180 --> 38:44.179
Mum.

38:45.780 --> 38:49.779
(SOBS)

39:00.140 --> 39:04.139
How you doing?

39:05.900 --> 39:08.619
You shouldn't be going
steady at your age, any road.

39:08.620 --> 39:12.619
At least not with someone who's
old enough to be your grandfather.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.779
I just feel so stupid,

39:17.780 --> 39:21.219
getting so teary over a boy.
You're the one with real problems.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.659
getting so teary over a boy.
You're the one with real problems.
Cheers.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.059
You know what I mean.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.019
I'm remembering stuff.

39:26.020 --> 39:27.579
Well, some stuff.

39:27.580 --> 39:30.699
And...?

39:30.700 --> 39:32.859
I can't believe that's all there is,

39:32.860 --> 39:36.539
that I've settled for what I've got.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.139
You haven't settled.

39:38.140 --> 39:40.659
Everyone thinks
the sun shines out your arse.

39:40.660 --> 39:44.659
Not about what other
people think, though, is it?

39:54.380 --> 39:56.059
Carl's right.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.299
No, he's not!

39:57.300 --> 40:00.099
About the gay thing.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.459
About it being a second chance.

40:02.460 --> 40:06.459
I've got to make changes, Debs.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.379
Get shot of the carrots, Ches.

40:17.380 --> 40:20.219
After sundown, all bets are off.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.419
What have you got?

40:21.420 --> 40:24.779
What have I not got. Must have
nearly every dish on Ashoka's menu.

40:24.780 --> 40:28.339
Have you really had nothing to
eat or drink, sunrise to sunset?

40:28.340 --> 40:31.539
Two days now. I'm really
starting to feel the benefit.

40:31.540 --> 40:33.499
Didn't think you were up to it.

40:33.500 --> 40:37.219
I can understand supporting us
during Ramadan, but Sawm's voluntary.

40:37.220 --> 40:39.979
That's going the extra mile.

40:39.980 --> 40:43.979
Voluntary?

40:48.100 --> 40:50.779
Sawm is voluntary.
Not compulsory, voluntary.

40:50.780 --> 40:51.859
Yeah, I know.

40:51.860 --> 40:54.579
Chicken jalfrezi and a lamb bhuna.
Get upstairs.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.579
But...Now!

40:58.820 --> 41:02.819
Mum?

41:03.020 --> 41:07.019
Debbie!
Please, we have to talk.

41:08.380 --> 41:12.379
Debbie!

41:13.620 --> 41:16.779
Oi, I've got a baby
sleeping in there, or not sleeping.

41:16.780 --> 41:18.139
She's still in there.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.579
I want to talk to her.

41:19.580 --> 41:22.339
That's a woman's prerogative, son.
Lesson number one.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.459
That's a woman's prerogative, son.
Lesson number one.
I said, I want to talk to her!

41:24.460 --> 41:25.699
Agh!

41:25.700 --> 41:27.979
What did you do that for?

41:27.980 --> 41:30.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:30.420 --> 41:33.459
Just...
Because you picked the wrong night.

41:33.460 --> 41:37.459
There's been enough crying
round here. I'm not having it.

41:38.140 --> 41:39.699
I've got a gun.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.619
Yeah, and I don't give
a monkey's fart if you use it.

41:42.620 --> 41:46.619
I've got a wife and a daughter
in there, both of whom are going to
need scraping off the floor later.

41:47.820 --> 41:51.819
So go on, do your worst.

41:53.300 --> 41:56.139
Fine.

41:56.140 --> 42:00.139
I'll use it on myself.

42:00.740 --> 42:01.979
Dad?

42:01.980 --> 42:04.939
Go inside, Carl.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.179
You don't understand.

42:06.180 --> 42:07.539
I can't make you out,
you've got the...

42:07.540 --> 42:10.659
I can't make you out,
you've got the...
You don't understand. I love her.

42:10.660 --> 42:14.659
I've got nine kids
by two different women,

42:15.300 --> 42:19.299
both of whom are beautifully demented
in their own unique manner.

42:20.140 --> 42:22.699
You think I haven't shed tears?

42:22.700 --> 42:25.419
We could have made it
if it wasn't for everybody else.

42:25.420 --> 42:28.139
We could have made it
if it wasn't for everybody else.
There's always someone to blame.

42:28.140 --> 42:31.419
I'll tell you something
I do know, though.

42:31.420 --> 42:33.259
When it goes bad,

42:33.260 --> 42:37.259
no matter how hard you try,
you'll never get it back again.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.379
Never!

42:39.380 --> 42:42.059
So just gather yourself up,
and move on.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.339
I'd rather die.

42:43.340 --> 42:45.979
Then, think on this, Constable.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.299
That is my daughter in there,

42:48.300 --> 42:50.779
and if you ruin her life

42:50.780 --> 42:54.779
by blowing your charming,
but deeply flawed, Celtic brains

42:55.980 --> 42:57.899
all over my back yard,

42:57.900 --> 43:01.899
I will piss on your grave
each and every fucking day.

43:03.220 --> 43:07.219
That I promise ya.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.739
Don't be a daftie, give me that.

43:11.740 --> 43:13.139
Is everything all right?

43:13.140 --> 43:17.139
Yeah. Yeah.

43:17.660 --> 43:21.019
Think there's a lad could
do with an escort home, Stan.

43:21.020 --> 43:24.019
Of course.
I'll just get dressed.

43:24.020 --> 43:28.019
Come in, Tom.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.419
Oh, how...?

43:50.420 --> 43:54.419
I don't know.
She wouldn't stop crying,

43:54.700 --> 43:58.699
and I didn't know what else to do,
and she hasn't come up for air.

43:59.020 --> 44:03.019
Oh.

44:05.260 --> 44:09.259
So what's the story, morning glory?

44:12.340 --> 44:16.339
I'm proud of ya, Dad.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.299
I baptise you
Stella Iana Princess Gallagher,

44:28.940 --> 44:32.939
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

44:33.420 --> 44:34.659
Amen.

44:34.660 --> 44:37.419
Thought you might want these.

44:37.420 --> 44:38.859
Only if you two will be godparents.

44:38.860 --> 44:40.459
Only if you two will be godparents.
Can I be the bloke?

44:40.460 --> 44:44.459
I don't mind.

44:45.340 --> 44:49.219
Do you promise to shower this child

44:49.220 --> 44:52.179
with a rainbow of love,
and sprinkle on her head

44:52.180 --> 44:55.299
the star-dust of each wondrous day?

44:55.300 --> 44:59.299
(BOTH) We do.

45:12.420 --> 45:14.339
What are you doing?

45:14.340 --> 45:15.939
What are you doing?
I'm going away for a bit.

45:15.940 --> 45:17.659
You haven't had your stitches out.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.179
They're dissolving ones.
It'll be fine.

45:19.180 --> 45:21.179
They're dissolving ones.
It'll be fine.
Where are you going?

45:21.180 --> 45:22.899
I don't know yet.

45:22.900 --> 45:26.899
I've got some money in the bank,
or so the statement says.
I'll see where I end up.

45:27.140 --> 45:28.299
Do you hate us?

45:28.300 --> 45:30.619
Do you hate us?
God, no. I love ya.

45:30.620 --> 45:34.619
It's just remembering stuff
you'd forgotten about yourself.

45:35.500 --> 45:39.099
It's exciting,
but it's disappointing, too.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.979
And I don't want disappointments.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.619
Will you write to us?

45:43.620 --> 45:47.539
I'll phone you. It's not the
18th-fucking-century.

45:47.540 --> 45:48.939
Shouldn't you tell the rest of them?

45:48.940 --> 45:50.899
Shouldn't you tell the rest of them?
You tell them for me.

45:50.900 --> 45:54.899
They've had a rough few days.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.019
But you'll come back?
Course I will.

45:57.020 --> 45:58.659
You fucking better.

45:58.660 --> 46:02.659
Oi! Just cos you're 16,
don't mean you can swear.

46:09.900 --> 46:13.899
So maybe the tabloids are wrong
and we, yes, we are not all so bad.

46:15.700 --> 46:19.699
So what if we wear our hearts
and our appetites on our sleeves?

46:19.700 --> 46:21.339
Who's to judge? You?

46:21.340 --> 46:24.019
Life shouldn't be bland.

46:24.020 --> 46:26.179
You get one shot.

46:26.180 --> 46:28.819
Life should be devoured
like the feast that it is.

46:28.820 --> 46:32.819
Keith Richards on a bender,
and that's why I'm sticking around.
