Truffle guy, Niki-san.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.393
When I first saw her...

06:34.477 --> 06:37.229
I didn't think such a small girl

06:37.313 --> 06:41.609
would be able to cook at our restaurant.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.779
I even made fun of her for it
in the beginning.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.950
I told her it was like
she was playing chef.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.953
She was very upset. "This is not play,"
she said. "I'm very serious."

06:53.913 --> 06:56.332
Niki is very petite and very pretty.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.627
When she first started
working at my restaurant,

06:59.711 --> 07:01.170
she became a mascot.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.054
It is rare for a female chef

07:10.137 --> 07:16.060
to work in a Japanese restaurant.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.731
We say, "Ask if you don't understand,

12:54.816 --> 12:57.151
watch and learn the rest."

12:57.234 --> 12:59.736
This is the best way to become a chef.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.758
When a customer returns to my restaurant,

13:21.843 --> 13:25.054
I already know
what they are going to order.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.807
So I serve something as they sit down,

13:28.891 --> 13:30.392
they are always surprised.

13:31.768 --> 13:33.938
They ask me, "How did you know?"

13:34.021 --> 13:36.357
To which I answer,
"You are my customer...

13:37.399 --> 13:39.526
of course I remember what you like."

17:24.585 --> 17:26.587
Of course you did!

19:47.353 --> 19:49.020
What is this?

19:49.104 --> 19:52.441
That's the book I made Niki
for her birthday.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.444
Niki turns 39 years.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.578
5:30 people and 6:00 people.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.668
Kaiseki is a course meal

27:07.751 --> 27:09.795
consisting of seven or eight dishes,

27:09.878 --> 27:13.131
presented in a very precise order.

27:15.425 --> 27:20.847
Course meals usually start at a low point
and rise to the main dish.

27:20.931 --> 27:24.851
The dessert at the end sort of
comes back down like this.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.478
It's really very melodic.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.835
I went to her restaurant
twice in one week.

37:34.919 --> 37:39.507
She served a completely different menu
both times.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.303
It's not easy to do,
and she pulled it off like it was nothing.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.556
She surprised me.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.267
It was truly exceptional.
