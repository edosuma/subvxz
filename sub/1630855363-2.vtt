Let's just, let's not
talk about it, actually.

00:26.412 --> 00:27.514
I don't wanna talk about it.

00:27.547 --> 00:28.850
It's like the third time
you mentioned it.

00:28.883 --> 00:29.785
You sure you don't
wanna talk about it?

00:29.818 --> 00:32.056
Yeah, 'cause it's like
a vibe, you know.

00:32.089 --> 00:33.493
-What's the vibe?
-The vibe is just like,

00:33.526 --> 00:34.595
it's off, something's off.

00:34.628 --> 00:36.899
Like, he'd be happier
if I was a plumber or something.

-Huh. Corner.
-Corner.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.165
Look, it's probably hard
for your dad to be supportive

00:53.198 --> 00:55.637
because he doesn't understand
that this job doesn't pay much.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.274
It doesn't amount
to anything and, uh,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.177
it doesn't make
a whole lot of sense,
you know.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.515
Uh, hey, how are
we doing, Chefs?

01:01.548 --> 01:02.484

01:27.132 --> 01:28.536
They're hand cast in Italy.

01:28.569 --> 01:30.507
Yeah, and we're in Illinois.

01:30.540 --> 01:32.377
Ugh, what about the Danish teak?

01:32.410 --> 01:34.515
Hmm. Those are 3K,
which you said cost 2K.

01:34.548 --> 01:35.550
The bronze brutalist?

01:35.583 --> 01:36.619
Those are actually 2K.

01:36.652 --> 01:38.155
You can have
the Naperville Nickel.

01:38.188 --> 01:39.391
Are you feeling okay, Nat?

01:39.424 --> 01:40.960
By the way,
you look a little pale.

01:40.993 --> 01:42.163
Is it the Naperville Nickel?

01:42.196 --> 01:44.033
I'm fine. Just, uh...

01:44.066 --> 01:46.472
Sometimes
I look like February.

01:46.505 --> 01:47.507
Sure.

-Oh.

01:58.061 --> 01:59.932
Marcus just broke it.
Can you order a new one?

Sure. You can
shove it up your ass.

If it makes you feel any better,

my sister doesn't think
I'm a genius, so...

02:10.085 --> 02:11.322
It doesn't hurt.

02:11.355 --> 02:12.958
...have your sandpaper
attached to your pole.

02:12.991 --> 02:15.463

...any uneven spots.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.513
Alright.

02:23.546 --> 02:24.648
Alright, gentlemen.

02:24.681 --> 02:26.151
I'm taking over this operation.

02:26.184 --> 02:28.121
Now before we can
execute a deep clean,

02:28.154 --> 02:29.090
we gotta peel all this paint.

02:29.123 --> 02:30.092
That's what I just said.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.529
Yeah, but what you didn't say,

02:31.562 --> 02:33.131
what you didn't say
is that there's no reason

02:33.164 --> 02:35.336
to move these lockers twice.

02:35.369 --> 02:36.505
Marcus, we got putty?

02:36.538 --> 02:38.008
We have to move everything out

02:38.041 --> 02:39.076
before we scrape.

02:39.109 --> 02:40.246
Richie, you're not listening.

02:40.279 --> 02:41.047
Look, I don't
wanna choose sides,

02:41.080 --> 02:42.216
but it seems
like moving the lockers

02:42.250 --> 02:43.419
is the best way to do this.

02:43.452 --> 02:45.256
Wow, Marcus, I never
thought I'd see the day

02:45.289 --> 02:47.460
where you would form
an actual alliance
with Neil Geoff.

02:47.493 --> 02:49.598
Alright, Richie,
it's not an alliance.
It's just like common sense--

02:49.631 --> 02:50.733
It sure sounded
like an alliance.

02:50.766 --> 02:51.702
No, no. It's just like
common sense.

02:51.735 --> 02:52.570
Move the lockers first.

02:52.604 --> 02:54.975
I'm watching a guy
who does this shit

02:55.008 --> 02:56.412
all the fuckin' time.

02:56.445 --> 02:57.447
He just tarps over.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.451
I'm trying to save you lizards
some moves here.

02:59.484 --> 03:01.522
I'll tell you what,
you take half the guys
in the dining room--

03:01.555 --> 03:03.058
-There's only three guys.
-Dude, I need

03:03.091 --> 03:04.595
all the hands to move
the lockers out right now.

03:04.628 --> 03:06.332
Okay, fine.
We'll do it your way.

03:06.365 --> 03:08.001
You take, uh, two guys--

03:08.034 --> 03:09.271
-It's still your fuckin' way.
-RICHIE: Good? Go.

03:09.304 --> 03:10.473
No, it's not my fuckin' way.

03:10.506 --> 03:11.742
There's not sides!

03:11.775 --> 03:14.013
There's one way,
it's the fuckin' right way!

03:14.046 --> 03:15.114
Watch this.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.154
-Nat?
-You just, you called Mom?

03:18.187 --> 03:19.691
-You called Mom?
-Yes, honey.

03:19.724 --> 03:22.129
Okay, listen, so...

03:22.162 --> 03:24.233
Okay, I just wanna do it right.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.170
And I do think that we need
to move the lockers out first

03:26.203 --> 03:27.105
before we scrape.

03:27.138 --> 03:29.210
So then move
the lockers first, my love.

03:29.244 --> 03:30.413
Then we're just gonna
move them right back

03:30.446 --> 03:31.715
where they are, Natalie.

03:31.748 --> 03:33.218
Why fuck 'em up?

03:33.252 --> 03:35.188
Don't start bossing
people around, please.

03:35.723 --> 03:37.794
Natalie, I'm trying
to head up this operation.

03:37.827 --> 03:39.731
I'm trying to
assert myself, okay?

03:39.764 --> 03:42.437
I don't know what they teach you
about leadership at the bank,

03:42.470 --> 03:45.643
but in this kind of a situation,
what you need is an alpha,

03:45.676 --> 03:47.012
and that is not Fak.

03:47.045 --> 03:48.282
They can smell his pheromones.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.219
They are weak as shit.
That's just chemistry.

03:50.253 --> 03:52.088
Move the fucking lockers.

03:53.459 --> 03:54.695
-Are you alright?
-SUGAR: I'm fine.

03:54.728 --> 03:55.597
You want a Sprite?

03:55.630 --> 03:58.034
-You look kinda green.
-SUGAR: Mm-mmm.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.477
For real, you're shitty.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.779
-I didn't wanna do it wrong.
-You're shitty.

04:03.812 --> 04:04.715
I didn't wanna do it wrong.

04:04.748 --> 04:06.050
You did call Mom, though.

04:06.083 --> 04:06.785
Thank you, Marcus.

04:06.818 --> 04:08.121
Yeah, but you were wrong.

04:08.154 --> 04:09.457
What? You were.

04:12.397 --> 04:13.665
(quietly) Move 'em.

04:14.199 --> 04:17.039
Okay, Chefs, we are
three months out from open

04:17.072 --> 04:19.210
and I want everybody
to stay sharp.

04:19.244 --> 04:22.350
So we're gonna be sending
you guys to culinary school.

04:24.788 --> 04:26.325
But I already know
how to do it.

04:26.358 --> 04:28.228
Oh, well,
it's not about that, Chef.

04:28.262 --> 04:30.132
It's about, you know,
repetition, right?

04:30.165 --> 04:32.069
And it's already
built into the budget,

04:32.102 --> 04:33.239
so you'll still be paid hourly.

04:33.272 --> 04:35.142
Oh, I'm in.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.078
Let's do it, baby!

04:38.549 --> 04:40.853
Uh, Ebra, this is gonna be
a really great way

04:40.886 --> 04:43.057
to take advantage
of our time here.

04:44.828 --> 04:46.332
I don't want
to wear a uniform.

04:46.365 --> 04:48.736
Okay. Well, you can
discuss that with the school.

04:48.769 --> 04:50.472
It's not that kinda uniform.

04:50.806 --> 04:52.276
SYDNEY: This is exciting.

04:53.312 --> 04:54.514
I accept.

04:54.547 --> 04:55.850
Great. Okay. Yeah.

04:55.883 --> 04:57.186

-(loud thud)

05:03.197 --> 05:04.501

-FAK: I'm going left!

05:04.534 --> 05:05.536
You gotta go right.

05:05.569 --> 05:07.507
No, it's-it's the fridge handle.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.210
The fridge handle,
it keeps, um...

05:09.244 --> 05:11.415
It's breaking.
Yeah, it's breaking off, yeah.

05:11.448 --> 05:12.617
-FAK: Okay!
-Not left.

05:12.650 --> 05:14.388
-FAK: Pick it up!
-Come on.

but can you please
shut the fuck up.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.728
-RICHIE: Yo. Cousin.
-FAK: Carmy, I wanted
to do it the right way--

05:34.761 --> 05:36.865
I had this shit all dialed
and then this cucumber,

05:36.898 --> 05:38.736
-he's gotta tell Mom--
-...and he made it his.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.640
I can't get a grip
on the lockers 'cause
Mikey's is still locked.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.211
Alright. Hey. Got it.
Thank you. Thank you.

05:55.603 --> 05:57.707

05:57.740 --> 05:58.876

05:58.909 --> 05:59.877

-I need more, um, inspiration.
-What do you mean?

07:11.688 --> 07:12.957

09:49.002 --> 09:50.037
Um...

09:50.772 --> 09:52.844
And your brain
does this weird thing

09:52.877 --> 09:56.818
where it just bypasses
any sense of joy.

09:56.851 --> 09:59.590
It just like
attaches itself to dread.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.062
And, um, I don't know,
after those ten seconds,

10:02.095 --> 10:03.632
I had to turn over
a really slow table

10:03.665 --> 10:04.834
'cause the, uh,

10:04.867 --> 10:06.538
entire United Nations

-Yo, can we switch?

10:33.659 --> 10:34.861
You can see fine

10:34.894 --> 10:35.829

Don't freak out
and go calling for Mom, okay?

11:01.815 --> 11:03.519
This is scary.
This could ruin everything.

11:03.552 --> 11:04.921
Listen, it is scary, okay?

11:04.954 --> 11:06.992
And I will grant you
that it's gained some traction

11:07.025 --> 11:08.127
in recent media cycles.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.931
Mold is a buzzword,
yeah, for sure.

11:09.964 --> 11:11.735
But if you go call Mom,
she's gonna call in

-Yeah, like,
what's your middle name?
-Lawrence.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.130
Well, Richard Lawrence,
I'm telling Mom now.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.867
Don't you fucking dare.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.069
I'm gonna call Mom right now.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.673
-Don't you fucking dare.
-I dare. I dare.

11:30.706 --> 11:31.608

Actually, I dare you.

11:31.641 --> 11:33.545
-I dare right now.
-I dare you. Call Mom.

11:33.578 --> 11:34.948

11:36.050 --> 11:37.052
-Call Mom. Call Mom.
-Mom. Mom.

11:37.085 --> 11:37.987
-See what happens.
-Mom. Mom.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.257
-She can't hear you.
-(whispering) Nat...

11:39.290 --> 11:40.492
See what happens
when you call her.

11:40.526 --> 11:42.095
-Want me to do it loud?
-See what happens
when you call her.

11:42.128 --> 11:43.030
I'll get louder.
I'll get louder.

11:43.063 --> 11:45.201
RICHIE: Get louder
and see what happens.

11:45.234 --> 11:46.505
Mom!

11:46.538 --> 11:47.005
(muffled screams)

11:51.146 --> 11:53.519
You should have all received
your student login

11:53.552 --> 11:55.088
after the Zoom orientations.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.858
I'll be sending you
a link to the board

11:56.891 --> 11:58.529

12:13.325 --> 12:15.563
Uh, veal chop demi-glace.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.533
I was thinking like
hamachi crudo,
but that might be...

12:17.566 --> 12:19.203
-I don't know.
-No, that's good.

12:19.236 --> 12:20.137

12:21.006 --> 12:22.242

12:25.649 --> 12:27.185

12:29.122 --> 12:30.826
-Cherry?
-Cherry vinegar?

12:30.859 --> 12:32.897
-(whistles, pops tongue)
-Cherry vinegar.

12:49.263 --> 12:50.699
TINA:
You got this, baby.

12:50.732 --> 12:51.801
You got this.

12:52.903 --> 12:53.938
Yes, Chef.

12:58.113 --> 13:00.719
Hey, um,
can I ask you something?

13:00.752 --> 13:02.021
You can tell me to fuck off.

13:03.925 --> 13:04.827
Yeah?

13:04.860 --> 13:07.031
Really want
one of these bullshit stars?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.336
Yeah.

13:11.106 --> 13:12.243
Yeah, I really do.

13:12.276 --> 13:14.781
You're gonna have to
care about everything.

13:14.814 --> 13:15.916
More than anything.

13:25.269 --> 13:28.942
The, um, last dinner that I did
with Sheridan Road

13:28.975 --> 13:31.113
was this fundraiser
at this lady's house,

13:31.146 --> 13:33.285
and she was so mean

13:33.318 --> 13:34.954
and she wanted...

13:34.987 --> 13:37.091
demanded fresh pasta.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.031
So, you know me,
I'm like, yeah, let's-let's go.

13:40.064 --> 13:44.139
And then I get there
and it's dried out.

13:44.172 --> 13:47.914
Ev-ev-everything that I try
to roll out is crumbling

13:47.947 --> 13:49.250
and clock is ticking.

13:49.283 --> 13:50.953
And I've got this beautiful,

13:50.986 --> 13:53.057
I mean, like this gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous lamb ragu.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.994
I've been working on it
for, like, 72 hours.

13:55.027 --> 13:56.129
It was perfect...

13:57.900 --> 13:59.304
but I didn't have any pasta.

13:59.337 --> 14:04.314
So I spooned that shit
over King's Hawaiian rolls.

14:04.347 --> 14:05.416
Sounds delicious.

14:05.449 --> 14:06.952
It wasn't bad.

14:06.985 --> 14:08.322
Was that before you
moved in with your dad?

14:08.355 --> 14:09.924
That is why
I moved in with my dad.

14:09.957 --> 14:11.428
-Oh, shit.
-SYDNEY: Oh, yeah.

14:11.461 --> 14:14.968
-That was the one, huh?
-That was the one.

14:15.001 --> 14:16.871
Well, at least
you can rely on him.

14:20.211 --> 14:21.380
Is your mom cool?

14:22.750 --> 14:23.818
Yeah.

14:27.393 --> 14:29.930
-It's lacto ferment?
-SYDNEY: Yeah, yeah.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.074
Oh, fuck.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.412
-SYDNEY: Mm. Mm-mm.
-Oh, my God.

14:38.982 --> 14:40.184
Chef, that's way too much acid.

14:40.217 --> 14:41.888
-Oh, my God.
-Holy shit.

14:41.921 --> 14:43.392
Did I fuck up your recipe or--

14:43.425 --> 14:45.930
No. I must've just given you
the wrong count, it's fine.

14:45.963 --> 14:47.266
Wait, do you need
a Rolaid or something?

14:47.299 --> 14:48.200
Did I give you heartburn?

14:48.233 --> 14:50.038
-'Cause I... That's fucked.
-CARMY: No.

14:50.071 --> 14:51.841
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's, um...

14:51.874 --> 14:53.043
I'm sorry.

14:53.411 --> 14:57.018
In sign, uh,
two of my old chefs
used to do it.

14:57.051 --> 14:58.822
You know, if they were angry,

14:58.855 --> 15:00.225
fighting on the line,
it helped.

15:00.259 --> 15:01.795
It was like their version of,

15:01.828 --> 15:03.731
"Let's talk about this later,"
you know.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.704
It didn't matter if one
tore the other one apart.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.042
It always got them
through service.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.388
It's good.

15:17.259 --> 15:18.895
(clears throat)

15:24.874 --> 15:25.843
You know,
your dad, he, um...

15:25.876 --> 15:28.146
Yo. Sorry. Um...

15:29.517 --> 15:31.254
The frozen concord grapes.

15:31.287 --> 15:34.394
We do like a beef consommé
type thing.

15:34.427 --> 15:36.297
Smoked bone marrow?

15:38.501 --> 15:39.771
That's something.

15:39.804 --> 15:41.006
It's something.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.446
I don't even really know.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.884
-Mikey died and...
-(toilet gurgles)

15:47.286 --> 15:50.259
I just never wanted
to be in this place at all.

15:50.292 --> 15:52.263
Then my other brother
started running the place,

15:52.296 --> 15:54.534
and now I wanna
be here all the time.

15:54.567 --> 15:56.304
Fucking disgusting.

15:56.337 --> 15:57.306
Is that healthy?

15:57.339 --> 15:58.909
(toilet gurgles)

15:58.942 --> 16:00.879
So much is about to change.

16:01.414 --> 16:04.453
Am I just here to try
and force everything
to stay the same?

16:06.223 --> 16:10.398
But then I think I could
be good at this, you know.

16:10.932 --> 16:13.104
But as adults,
we never try new things

16:13.137 --> 16:17.178
because it just
becomes so easy to keep
doing the same exact thing

16:17.211 --> 16:19.484
with the same exact people.

16:19.517 --> 16:21.153
Who doesn't want easy?

16:21.186 --> 16:24.259
Who doesn't wanna
just fucking be okay?

16:26.597 --> 16:28.066
-Like...
-(toilet gurgles)

16:28.801 --> 16:31.072
I haven't even told
anyone I'm pregnant.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.809
(toilet gurgles)

16:33.912 --> 16:35.048
There. Okay.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.417
The photo
should have uploaded.

16:37.886 --> 16:39.891
No, I definitely
already sent the one

16:39.924 --> 16:41.895
of the flush valve gasket.

16:41.928 --> 16:43.332
I don't even think
that's where the issue is

16:43.365 --> 16:45.803
'cause the drip's coming
from the shut-off valve.

16:45.836 --> 16:47.472
-(toilet gurgles)
-Yeah, no, I know.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.979
Okay, fine, Gene, yes.

16:51.012 --> 16:54.520
You are the plumber.
Uh-huh.

16:54.553 --> 16:56.222
Okay, I'll send it over. Bye.

how to fuckin' watch stuff?

-No, we don't.

17:16.597 --> 17:18.134

Uh, it wasn't a question.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.238
A guy just returned our call
about a mold problem

17:20.272 --> 17:22.476
and said it's definitely
a mold problem.

17:22.509 --> 17:26.618
Well, I wonder how the fuck
some guy would suspect us

17:26.651 --> 17:28.120
of having a mold problem.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.124
I don't know.

did you call a mold man?

-No.
-Fak.

17:33.998 --> 17:34.967
-Richie.
-Richie.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.203
Natalie, relax.

17:36.236 --> 17:37.573
It's under control, alright?

17:37.606 --> 17:39.944
These ceilings,
they're practically Styrofoam.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.213
Were we to have mold,

17:41.247 --> 17:43.116
they would collapse

Okay, here's one.

18:50.285 --> 18:52.589
It was our third date

18:52.990 --> 18:57.399
and we were maybe 20?

18:57.800 --> 19:00.037
Uh, just getting
to know each other,

19:00.070 --> 19:02.342
we liked each other,
but it was still early.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.714
We were going to a party.

19:04.747 --> 19:06.985
I borrowed
a friend of mine's car

19:07.018 --> 19:11.192
and we hit a rock or something
and popped the tire.

19:11.927 --> 19:14.567
And, young lady,
I can only admit this now

19:14.600 --> 19:19.142
because I can change a tire
faster than anybody ever could.

19:19.175 --> 19:21.447
But you didn't know
how to change a tire?

19:21.480 --> 19:24.052
Not at all.
I was trying to figure it out.

19:24.085 --> 19:25.689
-SYDNEY: Okay. Okay.
-Fast!

19:25.722 --> 19:29.196
And so I get underneath the hood
and I'm stalling, and I'm acting

19:29.229 --> 19:31.334
and-and I'm pretending
like I'm doing something,

19:31.367 --> 19:33.471
and she's just calm
in the car.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.642
So I walk out
of the car and I say,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.713
"I think it might be
the radiator."

19:37.746 --> 19:40.319
And she goes, "Oh, no."

19:40.352 --> 19:42.155
-She does not go, "Oh, no."
-EMMANUEL:
Your mama, your mama...

19:42.188 --> 19:43.592
Your mama was like
a southern belle.

19:43.625 --> 19:46.497
A Black southern belle.
"Yes, Beauregard."

19:46.530 --> 19:48.768
And so she gets out of the car,

19:48.801 --> 19:50.372
-she opens the hood...
-SYDNEY: Uh-huh.

19:50.405 --> 19:53.110
...she looks inside
and she says,

19:53.143 --> 19:56.451
"Huh. Uh-huh.
It's definitely the radiator."

19:56.484 --> 20:00.759
And I was like,
"Uh, yeah! Yeah."

20:00.792 --> 20:04.534
-No.
-EMMANUEL: So then she walks
to the back of the car,

20:04.567 --> 20:07.639
changes that damn tire
in ten seconds.

20:08.173 --> 20:11.481
Then gets in the car
and looks at me smiling.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.285
(Sydney laughs)

20:13.318 --> 20:15.455
You didn't know
her dad was a mechanic.

20:15.488 --> 20:18.060
I absolutely had no idea.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.463

21:09.263 --> 21:10.465
Claire. Hey.

21:11.567 --> 21:12.636
You-you got there.

21:12.669 --> 21:13.638
CARMY:
Yeah, it took me a sec.

21:13.671 --> 21:14.807
Took you a second, yeah.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.277
It's been, uh...

21:16.310 --> 21:17.546
CLAIRE: Forever.

21:17.579 --> 21:20.151
-Forever. Definitely.
-CLAIRE: Yeah.

21:20.184 --> 21:22.823
You, uh, making a sundae?

21:22.856 --> 21:26.264
Sundae? Oh, yeah.
A nice veal stock sundae.

21:26.297 --> 21:27.800
With vanilla ice cream?

21:27.833 --> 21:29.370
That actually
sounds delicious.

21:29.403 --> 21:30.772
-Yeah.
-(Claire chuckles)

21:32.809 --> 21:35.114
So how's your life been,
Berzatto?

21:35.147 --> 21:36.584
(clicks tongue)

21:36.885 --> 21:38.219
I have no idea.

21:41.827 --> 21:43.096
How about you?

21:44.433 --> 21:45.668
I have no idea.

21:54.887 --> 21:57.158
RICHIE:
You guys really don't
have to help me clean up.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.263
MARCUS: Yes, we do.

21:59.296 --> 22:01.433
It's not your fault.
It's the mold's.

22:05.174 --> 22:06.477
Thanks, Neil.

22:11.354 --> 22:13.558
You know, you did
the, uh, right thing

22:13.591 --> 22:16.297
when you placed
the anonymous call
to the mold people.

22:16.631 --> 22:18.435
I... I didn't.

22:18.468 --> 22:19.670
MARCUS: I did.

22:20.772 --> 22:22.275
What, I was trying to tell you.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.851
Alliance.

22:26.884 --> 22:28.287
MARCUS: Alliance.

22:28.788 --> 22:30.558
-Thanks.
-MARCUS: Alliance.

22:30.925 --> 22:32.730
SYDNEY:
So, yeah, we're just
finishing up the menu now,

22:32.763 --> 22:34.199
but it's really cool.

22:34.232 --> 22:35.335
Um, we're just
trying to make sure

22:35.368 --> 22:37.473
that we, you know,
are familiar,

22:37.506 --> 22:38.842
but obviously operating
at a higher level,

22:38.875 --> 22:40.345
you know what I mean?

22:40.378 --> 22:42.683
Um, and insane but cool.

22:42.716 --> 22:44.587
We want a star.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.893
It's personal victory and it's
also very good for business.

22:47.926 --> 22:50.197
Like, more than worth
the detour, like plan a trip--

22:50.230 --> 22:52.201
And-and how many
do you guys want?

22:52.536 --> 22:55.308
Oh. Um, one, I think.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.880
Yeah, that'll keep us
consistent, low to the ground,

22:57.913 --> 22:59.784
but obviously,
like a little bit above it.

22:59.817 --> 23:01.754
Uh, do you get paid the same?

23:01.787 --> 23:04.760
Well, TBD for a month
there'll be payment

23:04.793 --> 23:07.633
and then right now it's built
into the business plan

23:07.666 --> 23:09.336
that that'll take
a bit of a pause

23:09.369 --> 23:11.607
just so that the rest of
the team can definitely be paid.

23:12.909 --> 23:15.916
So... you have a job
for a month,

23:15.949 --> 23:18.220
then not a job.

23:18.254 --> 23:19.890
I will have a job.

23:19.923 --> 23:22.763
It's just that payment
will be deferred for six months

23:22.796 --> 23:24.366
and I'm not
the only one doing it.

23:24.399 --> 23:26.203
So is Carm, and also Natalie.

23:26.236 --> 23:28.475
Well, I... I can
tell you're excited

23:28.508 --> 23:31.747
and I am glad you're excited.

23:34.253 --> 23:35.555
Okay.

23:35.588 --> 23:41.267
I also want you to know
that Cousin Monty

23:41.300 --> 23:45.509
-always has a job
for you at Boeing...
-Okay.

23:45.542 --> 23:47.746
...if you decide
to make a change.

23:47.779 --> 23:49.650
If I decide to make a change
and just go like this

23:49.683 --> 23:51.654
at the airport
for the rest of my life, like--

23:51.687 --> 23:53.258
Honey, honey, it's-it's...

23:53.291 --> 23:54.927
It's a different beast,
that's all I'm saying.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.632
A different beast
than-than what?

23:59.870 --> 24:02.543
I read about
restaurants in the papers.

24:02.576 --> 24:05.282
-Oh, my God. What are you
reading in the papers?
-EMMANUEL: They're hard.

24:05.315 --> 24:06.551
And a lot of them--

24:06.584 --> 24:08.120
Yeah, a lot of them
don't work out.

24:08.153 --> 24:10.425
-Yes, we've actually
had this conversation before.
-I'm-I'm saying they...

24:10.458 --> 24:11.961
I'm saying they-they don't,

24:11.994 --> 24:14.834
that doesn't mean
that-that you-you won't.

24:14.867 --> 24:17.672
So then what does it mean?
Why are you bringing it up?

24:17.906 --> 24:19.242
(Emmanuel sighs)

24:19.676 --> 24:22.716
It's just interesting
that the backup plan

24:22.749 --> 24:24.920
is now the only plan.

24:26.457 --> 24:28.527
Okay. This is not last time.

24:28.861 --> 24:32.703
-I know it's not last time.
-I'm in a different place
in my life,

24:32.736 --> 24:34.607
in a, in a better place,
I think.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.410
And I know what I'm doing.

24:36.443 --> 24:37.980
I've learned a lot of lessons.

24:38.013 --> 24:40.752
I'm still learning,
which is actually a good thing.

24:40.785 --> 24:42.990
And also, I'm not alone,
like in your house.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.993
-I have a partner.
-And you trust him?

24:47.465 --> 24:48.601
Yes?

24:48.634 --> 24:49.836
I'm just asking.

24:50.772 --> 24:51.840
SYDNEY: Okay.

25:00.023 --> 25:01.293
You okay?

25:04.600 --> 25:05.968
It's weird, you know.

25:07.071 --> 25:08.707
I think I like...
(scoffs)

25:09.643 --> 25:10.812
I don't know.

25:12.515 --> 25:15.321
I just realized I'm, like,
older than her now, you know.

25:19.095 --> 25:20.698
But just as wonderful.

25:27.913 --> 25:29.850
I gotta go wash my hands.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.778
(exhales)

25:43.811 --> 25:45.649
I hear you're a doctor now.

25:45.682 --> 25:47.352
CLAIRE:
I... Almost a doctor.

25:47.385 --> 25:49.623
I have six months left
in my residency.

25:49.656 --> 25:50.692
And what kinda doctor?

25:50.725 --> 25:52.563
Uh, emergency medicine.

25:52.596 --> 25:53.664
Wow.

25:54.065 --> 25:57.806
That sounds, um... intense.

25:57.839 --> 25:59.510
-It isn't chill.
-CARMY: Right.

25:59.543 --> 26:00.845
Mm-hmm.

26:01.714 --> 26:03.049
So how did you, um...

26:03.784 --> 26:06.056
Is that something
like you get to pick that?

26:06.089 --> 26:07.492
You do.

26:07.525 --> 26:08.727
You, uh...

26:09.161 --> 26:12.502
Do you, uh, remember
Katie from Roosevelt?

26:13.437 --> 26:15.842
Hmm... maybe.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.815
When we were, like, six,
she, uh, fell off a fence
and broke her arm

26:18.848 --> 26:20.952
and it scared
the shit out of everybody?

26:21.454 --> 26:26.496
Except me,
I just, like, sat there
and stared at her arm.

26:27.465 --> 26:28.767
'Cause you wanted to fix it?

26:29.269 --> 26:30.771
I wanted to understand it.

26:32.742 --> 26:33.878
Right.

26:37.017 --> 26:39.590
That was at, uh,
that was Roosevelt or...

26:39.623 --> 26:41.794
Uh, no, Mrs. Kelly's.

26:41.827 --> 26:43.665
-CARMY: Mrs. Kelly?
-Yeah.

26:43.698 --> 26:45.000
CARMY:
That's so crazy. She, um...

26:45.033 --> 26:48.574
She emailed me, like,
a couple of years ago.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.146
She was asking advice,
her, uh, her son

26:51.179 --> 26:52.716
wanted to become a chef.

26:52.749 --> 26:54.586
And what did you tell him?

26:54.619 --> 26:57.024
I told him don't,
don't do that.

26:57.057 --> 26:58.995
-That sounds right. Right?
-CARMY: I think it's right.

26:59.028 --> 26:59.830
Yeah.

26:59.863 --> 27:01.634
CARMY: Yeah,
I should really, um...

27:01.667 --> 27:03.570
I should really
listen to myself.

27:04.204 --> 27:05.575
CLAIRE:
Why? What are you doing?

27:07.011 --> 27:08.714
Opening a restaurant.

27:11.152 --> 27:12.689
What?

27:12.722 --> 27:14.926
You're, uh,
you're doing the thing.

27:16.497 --> 27:18.434
Trying to, yeah.

27:18.467 --> 27:20.404
CLAIRE: I still...
I-I love the name.

27:20.671 --> 27:21.807
The name?

27:23.644 --> 27:25.582
You-you don't remember the name.

27:25.615 --> 27:26.617
Of course,
I remember the name.

27:26.650 --> 27:27.986
No, I don't think we even...

27:28.588 --> 27:29.990
We didn't even tell anybody
what the name was.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.260
You one hundred percent
told me the name.

27:31.293 --> 27:34.032
I bet you one million dollars
that you don't know the name.

27:34.065 --> 27:36.703
Prepare to be
out of a million dollars, dude.

27:37.305 --> 27:40.445
How could you
remember the name?

27:40.478 --> 27:42.849
Because you're The Bear
and I remember you.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.881
(sighs) I guess it's just like,
how am I getting my money now.

27:59.983 --> 28:02.020
-For sure. Um...
-Mm-hmm.

28:03.924 --> 28:05.929
Can you Venmo a million dollars?

28:05.962 --> 28:07.865
I feel like
that would be really shady.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.104
Yeah, somebody
somewhere would be like,

28:10.137 --> 28:11.941
that's-that's fucked up,
right?

28:11.974 --> 28:14.513
Somebody somewhere
would be, like,
really watching your ass.

28:14.546 --> 28:15.581
CARMY: Sure.

28:15.615 --> 28:17.919
Which is your choice
if you want that, you know.

28:17.952 --> 28:21.159
Um... why don't you just
wire it to be safe?

28:21.192 --> 28:23.063
Deal. Yeah, no,
that's-that's clean.

28:23.096 --> 28:24.533
CLAIRE: Yeah, that's clean.

28:24.566 --> 28:27.839
I'll just, uh, get
your contact information.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.509
CARMY: Yeah, it's, um...

28:30.345 --> 28:33.584
seven, seven, three,
five, five, five...

28:33.617 --> 28:34.919
CLAIRE: Five, five, five...

28:36.857 --> 28:38.126
...zero, nine...

28:38.159 --> 28:39.562
CLAIRE: Zero, nine...

28:40.865 --> 28:43.202

28:43.570 --> 28:45.173
