23:03.217 --> 23:05.136
Only through the newspapers.

23:05.137 --> 23:06.267
It is not what it was.

23:07.267 --> 23:10.277

23:12.137 --> 23:13.227

23:17.147 --> 23:19.367

so I came to this place.

23:20.287 --> 23:23.277
I waited for your return
from the Interior.

23:24.207 --> 23:25.316
How'd you know I'd return?

23:25.317 --> 23:29.176
Because you can't die until
you've served your purpose.

better because you are ill,

Do you understand that?

33:45.327 --> 33:48.156
- No exceptions.
- Yes.

33:48.157 --> 33:49.336
Do you understand that you are ill?

33:49.337 --> 33:52.276
Not bad, not unworthy, just ill.

Yes.

33:55.297 --> 33:56.326
Are your hands dry?

33:56.327 --> 33:58.206
- Yes.
- Then perhaps you should

33:58.207 --> 33:59.246
invest in some hand cream

33:59.247 --> 34:01.327
and save yourself the
expense of seeing me.

You mean your husband has money.

I have no husband.

34:07.327 --> 34:09.235
I have family money.

A small inheritance.

34:10.337 --> 34:13.206
Small or large, really?

34:13.206 --> 34:15.136
Large.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.266
My late father was a solicitor.

34:16.266 --> 34:18.177
Then why did you say small?

34:21.137 --> 34:22.295
I don't know.

34:22.297 --> 34:23.335
Politeness, I suppose.

34:23.337 --> 34:25.216
Is it impolite to have money?

34:25.217 --> 34:26.295
I don't know!

34:26.297 --> 34:28.216
DR. SEWARD: I don't
care about politeness.

34:28.217 --> 34:29.366
There are no manners here.

34:29.367 --> 34:32.216
If you want to scream like
an animal, you should.

34:32.217 --> 34:33.306
Or cry. Or yell.

34:34.137 --> 34:37.136
There are no emotions
unwelcome in this room,

34:37.137 --> 34:38.286

doesn't appeal to you,

34:38.286 --> 34:40.137
the door is there.

34:46.147 --> 34:47.347
You don't want me to leave.

34:48.266 --> 34:49.335
Why not?

34:49.337 --> 34:52.295
Because I scratch my hand.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.326
You find that telling.

34:54.337 --> 34:56.347
Those phobias that interest you.

34:58.157 --> 34:59.247
Do you interest me?

35:00.227 --> 35:01.187
I might.

35:01.317 --> 35:03.266
You're not sure.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.166
You don't need the 10 shillings.

35:05.167 --> 35:07.187
But you do need interesting people.

35:08.187 --> 35:09.187
Why?

35:09.188 --> 35:10.316
- To collect.
- To cure.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.157
Is there a difference?

35:22.167 --> 35:23.256
We've met before.

35:23.257 --> 35:25.166
DR. SEWARD: I'm sure not.

I mean, I've known
someone very like you.

35:29.317 --> 35:32.167

35:33.197 --> 35:35.196
My family name is Clayton.

35:35.197 --> 35:36.226

35:39.267 --> 35:40.346
Yes.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.207

35:43.147 --> 35:44.236
But that's immaterial.

more, understood?

35:46.317 --> 35:48.136

35:48.137 --> 35:50.197
And every other day at the same time.

35:53.167 --> 35:55.237
We'll begin our sessions?
We already have.

35:57.177 --> 35:58.356
But... (SCRIBBLING)

35:58.357 --> 36:01.146
but, don't you want to
know what's wrong with me?

36:01.147 --> 36:02.326
I already know what's wrong with you.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.226
You're unhappy.

36:04.227 --> 36:06.196
You're isolated.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.166
You think you're the cause
of this unhappiness

36:08.167 --> 36:11.206
and are unworthy of affection
so you've few friends.

36:11.207 --> 36:14.236
Recently you lost something
you think very important.

36:14.237 --> 36:17.316
Your lover, your faith,
your family, or all three.

36:17.317 --> 36:18.326
You blame yourself for this,

36:18.327 --> 36:20.296
so it makes you neurotic,
and you don't sleep

36:20.297 --> 36:23.206
and don't eat anything healthy anyway.

36:23.207 --> 36:24.276
You used to take care
of your appearance,

36:24.277 --> 36:27.356
but you've lost interest in
that, so you avoid mirrors.

36:27.357 --> 36:30.196
Sunlight bothers you,
so you avoid that too,

36:30.197 --> 36:31.246
about which you're guilty

36:31.247 --> 36:32.286
because you think it's unhealthy

36:32.287 --> 36:34.296
and even immoral not to like the sun.

36:34.297 --> 36:36.246
You're not a woman of convention

36:36.247 --> 36:38.246
or you wouldn't be here, but
you like to pretend you are

36:38.247 --> 36:39.811
so people don't notice you.

36:40.147 --> 36:41.326
But you sometimes like that as well,

36:41.327 --> 36:43.186
and can dress to draw the eye.

36:43.187 --> 36:45.246
But then you think the men
who look at you are fools,

36:45.247 --> 36:48.326
or worse, to be taken in by
such an obvious outward show.

36:48.327 --> 36:51.346
So, instead you're drawn
to dark, complicated,

36:51.347 --> 36:53.236
impossible men,

36:53.237 --> 36:56.156
assuring your own unhappiness
and isolation because,

36:56.157 --> 36:58.277
after all, you're happiest alone.

36:59.177 --> 37:01.176
But not even then because you can't

37:01.177 --> 37:03.136
stop thinking about what you've lost,

37:03.137 --> 37:05.256
again, for which you blame yourself.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.356
So the cycle goes on,

37:06.357 --> 37:09.237
the snake eating its own tail.

37:11.227 --> 37:14.227
Or you can just have your teeth fixed.

37:16.287 --> 37:18.136
I'll come tomorrow.

37:18.137 --> 37:19.317
First, you've something to do.

37:21.177 --> 37:23.226
Break the cycle for this one day.

37:23.227 --> 37:25.286
Do something you've never done before.

37:25.287 --> 37:26.326
Right now.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.366
Doesn't matter what it is.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.286
Eat something new.

37:29.287 --> 37:31.177
Go somewhere different.

37:31.327 --> 37:33.206
Tell me about it tomorrow.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.336
You understand?

37:34.337 --> 37:36.186
Yes.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.327
Pay my secretary on the way out.

37:38.337 --> 37:39.327

38:07.217 --> 38:09.247
DR. JEKYLL: So this is
where your Lily was born.

38:26.367 --> 38:28.197
What a thing, Victor.

38:29.227 --> 38:31.237
To have created life.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.306
Such a miracle.

38:34.307 --> 38:37.177
Yes, my miracle.

38:38.237 --> 38:39.337
Bringing forth horrors.

38:40.217 --> 38:43.137
And every act of my hideous creations,

38:44.177 --> 38:46.356
their every sin, hangs on me.

38:46.357 --> 38:48.306
You wonder why I turn to the needle.

38:48.307 --> 38:49.366
'Twas that or the noose.

38:49.367 --> 38:51.196
You're no suicide.

38:51.197 --> 38:52.236
You think too much of yourself.

38:52.237 --> 38:53.316
Ah, well, if that's what you...

38:53.317 --> 38:56.326
I haven't heard a bloody peep
from you in over five years,

38:56.327 --> 38:58.346
which caused me no small amount of pain,

38:58.347 --> 39:00.256
while we're at it,

39:00.257 --> 39:02.286
as I was never precisely
abundant with friends,

39:02.287 --> 39:04.136
if you remember.

39:04.137 --> 39:07.336
And now you call me here
and tell me all this,

39:07.337 --> 39:12.227
all these dreadful, gorgeous secrets.

39:13.327 --> 39:14.327
Why?

39:14.328 --> 39:15.366
I need your skills.

39:15.367 --> 39:17.246
You need my friendship first, Victor.
Look at you.

39:17.247 --> 39:19.247
That doesn't matter, don't you see?

39:20.287 --> 39:23.247
Only the evil I have spawned matters.

39:26.327 --> 39:28.227
You must help me destroy her.

39:32.167 --> 39:33.346
You want me to help you kill Lily?

39:33.347 --> 39:35.326
Yes. You will do that.

39:35.327 --> 39:37.137
You will help me.

39:37.237 --> 39:39.216
I have no one else.

39:39.217 --> 39:40.346
I am not a killer.

39:40.347 --> 39:42.137
Are you not?

39:43.267 --> 39:46.156
That despised half-caste boy I knew,

39:46.157 --> 39:47.176
crying himself to sleep.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.236
That shunned little wog

39:48.237 --> 39:50.256
who had not a friend in
the world aside from me.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.296
He could kill.

39:51.297 --> 39:53.206
God, he wanted to.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.236
You remember late at night in
our room, over the hookah,

39:55.237 --> 39:57.296
listing the names of all the
boys who had insulted you?

39:57.297 --> 40:00.136
The recitation of your
potential victims.

40:00.137 --> 40:01.257
Your nightly prayers.

40:02.347 --> 40:04.267
That anger inside you,

40:04.357 --> 40:06.226
all that rage.

40:06.227 --> 40:07.256
Have you lost it?

40:07.257 --> 40:09.177
I have learned to control it.

40:12.197 --> 40:15.246
That is the essence of my work now.

Don't flatter me.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.247
I know what I am.

40:28.227 --> 40:30.227
And you're right to acknowledge it.

40:32.267 --> 40:34.287
But I know you better
than you think, old man.

40:35.347 --> 40:39.247
The lonely boy I met at school
was, above all, romantic.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.366
His heart stirred to poetry

40:42.367 --> 40:45.197
even more than anatomy and Galvanism.

40:46.347 --> 40:48.226
You're still that boy, Victor.

40:48.227 --> 40:51.317
Be honest with yourself and with me.

40:53.187 --> 40:57.267
You don't want to kill Lily,
you want to love her.

(CHUCKLES)

40:59.267 --> 41:00.276
That's impossible.

41:00.277 --> 41:03.257
You have no idea of the
depths of her depravity.

41:05.247 --> 41:07.207
What if I could make her as she was?

41:07.277 --> 41:09.286
Before she turned on you?

41:09.287 --> 41:11.197
Before her evil emerged?

41:12.157 --> 41:13.237
What then?

41:15.197 --> 41:18.157
What if I could tame her?

41:19.267 --> 41:20.367
Domesticate her.

41:22.227 --> 41:25.277
Leave her purring like
a kitten on your lap.

41:26.327 --> 41:27.357
What then?

41:29.217 --> 41:30.277
Would you want that?

41:35.167 --> 41:36.206
Can you?

41:36.207 --> 41:37.237
Answer me.

41:37.337 --> 41:39.136
Yes.

41:39.137 --> 41:40.297
Then shall we attempt it?

41:41.347 --> 41:43.247
You and I, brother?

41:45.247 --> 41:46.267
Yes.

41:50.367 --> 41:52.227
I have to go to work now.

41:53.197 --> 41:56.137
But on Saturday I will take
you to my humble laboratory

41:57.207 --> 42:00.226
and you can witness my miracles.

42:00.227 --> 42:01.287
But hear me.

42:02.197 --> 42:04.136
If we should fail,

42:04.137 --> 42:06.296
if we prove incapable of helping her,

42:06.297 --> 42:08.137
we destroy her.

42:08.367 --> 42:10.217
Utterly.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.266
Albinoism is exceedingly rare in nature,

The absence of color, that is...

45:23.287 --> 45:25.206
signifying what?

45:25.207 --> 45:26.346
Bloodlessness. Uniqueness.

(SOFTLY) Beware.

He's from the Sudan. I think it's a he.

be the most dangerous,

45:38.367 --> 45:40.347
with his enormous claws.

45:41.287 --> 45:42.356

45:48.237 --> 45:49.326
That's what draws most people in.

The fear. You don't see them lining up

45:51.257 --> 45:54.206
to look at the sheep, more's
the pity, glorious animals.

- Your hobby.

No.

46:35.217 --> 46:37.197
Though I practiced it as a child.

46:38.157 --> 46:39.236
So did I.

46:39.237 --> 46:41.306
That's where I fell in
love with all this.

46:41.307 --> 46:44.256
A harmless hobby giving way to, what?

46:44.257 --> 46:46.287
A calling, I suppose.

46:47.357 --> 46:50.246
Did you know there are
certain deep-sea fish

46:50.247 --> 46:51.316
that create their own light

46:51.317 --> 46:54.316
and feed on lethal volcanic gasses?

46:54.317 --> 46:56.247
That's supposed to be impossible.

46:57.237 --> 47:00.366
And bats in Australia as large as dogs.

47:00.367 --> 47:03.316
And that American coyotes mate for life.

47:03.317 --> 47:06.146
And enormous octopi that
can squeeze their bodies

47:06.147 --> 47:08.297
through holes no larger
than a ha'penny coin.

47:09.267 --> 47:11.237
Can you imagine that?

47:12.347 --> 47:17.167
If only we would stop
and look and wonder.

47:19.147 --> 47:20.207
And wonder.

47:21.287 --> 47:23.336
Do you have a favorite?

47:23.337 --> 47:25.296
Not meant to.

All the broken and shunned creatures.

47:38.327 --> 47:40.366
Someone's got to care for them.
