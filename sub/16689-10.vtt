WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:03.326
Tonight on
"Kitchen Nightmares,"

00:03.326 --> 00:05.386
Gordon goes head to
head with the most

00:05.386 --> 00:08.206
stubborn chef he's ever met.

00:08.206 --> 00:10.306
That's a matter of opinion.

00:10.306 --> 00:12.206
And
unearths The Secret

00:12.206 --> 00:15.456
Garden's dirty little secrets.

00:16.456 --> 00:18.376
Gordon cooks up a rescue plan.

00:18.376 --> 00:20.226
We will make this is a success.

00:20.226 --> 00:22.316
But this
French chef fights back.

00:22.316 --> 00:23.416
Is everything perfect
in your kitchen?

00:23.416 --> 00:26.426
Don't you  dare
start lecturing me.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.376
This is the lowest day
of this restaurant's life.

00:29.376 --> 00:30.000
Pick up now.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.366
Pick up now.

00:30.366 --> 00:32.396
Can Gordon
save The Secret Garden?

00:32.396 --> 00:34.326
Who the  are you
to turn around and tell

00:34.326 --> 00:36.396
me when you work like a pit.

00:36.396 --> 00:38.186
You,  pig!

00:38.186 --> 01:00.000
Find out tonight
on "Kitchen Nightmares."

01:00.000 --> 01:05.386
Find out tonight
on "Kitchen Nightmares."

01:05.386 --> 01:08.226
Moorpark, California,
gateway to wine

01:08.226 --> 01:11.416
country, luxury golf courses,
and booming real estate.

01:11.416 --> 01:14.216
A great location
for a restaurant,

01:14.216 --> 01:17.296
but The Secret Garden is on
the brink of financial ruin.

01:18.236 --> 01:19.346
Thank you for calling
The Secret Garden.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.386
How may I help you?

01:21.386 --> 01:22.436
My name is Michel.

01:22.436 --> 01:26.166
I'm the chef and owner
at The Secret Garden.

01:26.166 --> 01:27.376
Am I a good chef?

01:27.376 --> 01:29.276
I think so.

01:29.276 --> 01:30.000
He's French.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.216
He's French.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.266
That's his biggest problem.

01:31.266 --> 01:32.226
He's French.

01:32.226 --> 01:36.306
So you're going to have
to excuse my arrogance.

01:36.306 --> 01:38.296
I'm not cooking with the
stuff that's in there.

01:38.296 --> 01:40.426
When I lose my temper,
it's time for you to run.

01:40.426 --> 01:42.166
You told me already.

01:42.166 --> 01:43.336
We're going to comp it,
and they have to leave.

01:43.336 --> 01:47.316
Michel just may or blow up
and say, what are you doing?

01:47.316 --> 01:48.376
You want to push
me in the kitchen,

01:48.376 --> 01:50.386
I will scream at everybody.

01:50.386 --> 01:51.336
Michel's arrogant.

01:51.336 --> 01:52.436
He's French.
He's a chef.

01:52.436 --> 01:53.456
All chefs are arrogant.

01:53.456 --> 01:54.416
You know what?

01:54.416 --> 01:56.196
Stop repeating, OK?

01:56.196 --> 01:58.246
French people enjoy
the quality of life

01:58.246 --> 02:00.000
a little more than
the Americans.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.216
a little more than
the Americans.

02:01.216 --> 02:01.555
I spill.

02:01.555 --> 02:05.356
Michel can be very, very
difficult to work with.

02:05.356 --> 02:06.296
Jane?

02:06.296 --> 02:07.436
Michel?

02:07.436 --> 02:08.396
Serve that.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.336
That cannot sit.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.406
He's got an ego
the size of France.

02:11.406 --> 02:13.216
As soon as it's ready!

02:13.216 --> 02:14.276
Come on, I got two.
Let's fix it.

02:14.276 --> 02:15.216
No, no, no, no.

02:15.216 --> 02:17.316
I'm getting frustrated.

02:17.316 --> 02:20.376
The atmosphere here
is definitely geared

02:20.376 --> 02:24.366
toward a more mature crowd.

02:24.366 --> 02:27.286
This is the kind of restaurant
that you take your grandma out

02:27.286 --> 02:29.346
for a nice meal.

02:29.346 --> 02:30.000
It's not really the happening
Saturday night spot.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.326
It's not really the happening
Saturday night spot.

02:33.326 --> 02:35.406
Michel is having a tough
time making ends meet.

02:35.406 --> 02:39.166
I can only imagine what
his books must look like.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.276
We need $200.

02:41.276 --> 02:42.426
That's not gonna
pay the bills again.

02:42.426 --> 02:47.206
I have about $300,000
to $320,000 in debt.

02:47.206 --> 02:48.446
That's a lot of
money to pay back.

02:48.446 --> 02:50.226
This is depressing.

02:50.226 --> 02:51.166
Look at that.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.256
If the restaurant keeps
going the way it's going,

02:53.256 --> 02:55.356
I won't be able to
keep the doors open.

02:55.356 --> 02:56.296
I need help.

03:01.296 --> 03:04.366
The Secret Garden, fine dining.

03:04.366 --> 03:06.436
Gordon
Ramsay has just one week

03:06.436 --> 03:09.386
to uncover the problems,
to devise a plan,

03:09.386 --> 03:11.316
and to turn this
restaurant around.

03:14.256 --> 03:17.236
Place is locked.

03:17.236 --> 03:18.386
Where's the entrance?

03:24.346 --> 03:27.226
That's locked, as well.

03:27.226 --> 03:29.326
God.

03:29.326 --> 03:30.000
A door.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.266
A door.

03:30.266 --> 03:31.206
Right.

03:36.436 --> 03:37.376
Bloody hell.

03:45.176 --> 03:45.515
God.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.316
Where is everybody?

03:52.316 --> 03:53.256
Hello?

03:53.256 --> 03:54.356
Is anyone here?

03:58.266 --> 03:59.436
Who wants to sit
and eat in front

03:59.436 --> 04:00.000
of that fat little bastard?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.436
of that fat little bastard?

04:02.436 --> 04:05.206
Morning.

04:05.206 --> 04:06.176
Hello.

04:06.176 --> 04:06.555
How are you?

04:06.555 --> 04:08.196
And you are?
-Jane.

04:08.196 --> 04:08.535
Jane.

04:08.535 --> 04:09.436
Good to see you.

04:09.436 --> 04:10.376
Where's chef?

04:10.376 --> 04:11.416
Chef's here.

04:11.416 --> 04:12.406
-OK.
-Michel.

04:12.406 --> 04:13.376
Good morning.
Welcome.

04:13.376 --> 04:15.216
How are you?
-Michel, how are you?

04:15.216 --> 04:16.246
Yes.
Nice to meet you.

04:16.246 --> 04:17.186
Good to see you.

04:17.186 --> 04:18.166
Well, I finally got in.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.166
Couldn't find the front door.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.336
The front door is
off the parking lot.

04:20.336 --> 04:22.246
Well, I mean, I
couldn't find it.

04:22.246 --> 04:23.346
So it's the best kept
secret in Moorpark.

04:26.296 --> 04:28.336
And you've been running the
restaurant for seven years?

04:28.336 --> 04:29.366
-Seven years, yes.
-Got it.

04:29.366 --> 04:30.000
And how long has
it been quiet for?

04:30.000 --> 04:30.276
And how long has
it been quiet for?

04:30.276 --> 04:31.216
Seven years.

04:34.246 --> 04:38.246
OK, well I'll go and
sit in the restaurant.

04:38.246 --> 04:41.196
I feel like I'm at
Buckingham Palace.

04:41.535 --> 04:43.336
What is that?

04:43.336 --> 04:46.276
That's a-- it's a doily.

04:46.276 --> 04:47.316
People love those.

04:47.316 --> 04:48.296
-People love those?
-Mm-hm.

04:48.296 --> 04:49.236
Really?

04:49.236 --> 04:50.366
You've got all that
fancy crap on there,

04:50.366 --> 04:52.206
and yet the glass is dirty.

04:52.206 --> 04:53.436
Ugh, god.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.396
I feel like inviting my
gran round for lunch.

04:59.396 --> 05:00.000
Could you not have
got a bigger basket?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.166
Could you not have
got a bigger basket?

05:02.166 --> 05:04.176
I feel sorry for that poor
lonely bread roll in there.

05:04.176 --> 05:05.376
Let me just have a look
at it before you serve it.

05:05.376 --> 05:06.316
Oh.

05:06.316 --> 05:08.416
I feel like saying a prayer.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.286
So--

05:10.286 --> 05:12.186
A lunch menu and a dinner menu.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.406
Ooh la.

05:13.406 --> 05:15.326
Greens with sunflower
seeds, dried cranberries,

05:15.326 --> 05:16.456
and Montrachet cheese.

05:16.456 --> 05:18.396
God, is there anything
plain on here, Jane?

05:18.396 --> 05:20.236
I think it's all good.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.186
Thank  on that.

05:23.186 --> 05:24.266
Is the crab fresh?

05:24.266 --> 05:25.356
-No, it's canned.
-It's canned.

05:25.356 --> 05:26.296
Mm-hm.

05:26.296 --> 05:27.266
We'll can that one then.

05:27.266 --> 05:28.376
Baby spinach salad
with strawberries,

05:28.376 --> 05:30.000
goat cheese, asparagus,
hard boiled egg,

05:30.000 --> 05:30.406
goat cheese, asparagus,
hard boiled egg,

05:30.406 --> 05:32.236
and grilled garlic shrimp.

05:32.236 --> 05:33.246
Strawberries and shrimps?

05:33.246 --> 05:36.226
Mm-hm.

05:36.226 --> 05:38.186
I'll start with that,
please, as my appetizer.

05:38.186 --> 05:40.166
Absolutely.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.396
I've got to think about a
chef's perception of food

05:42.396 --> 05:43.436
when he starts to
put strawberries

05:43.436 --> 05:48.226
with fresh garlic shrimps.

05:48.226 --> 05:49.276
We'll see how he likes it.

05:49.276 --> 05:50.256
He's a customer.

05:50.256 --> 05:52.446
Customer is almost always right.

05:52.446 --> 05:54.266
Dear God, for what
we're about to receive

05:54.266 --> 05:56.196
may the Lord not kill
me with food poisoning.

06:02.456 --> 06:04.236
That's disgusting.

06:04.236 --> 06:07.196
I'll wait from the next course.

06:07.196 --> 06:08.256
Are you done?

06:08.256 --> 06:10.196
Yeah, I'm-- yeah.

06:10.196 --> 06:13.406
Sadly the prawns are stone
cold and under cooked.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.176
OK.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.276
Your prawns are
undercooked, I'm told.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.226
When he sent the
first dish back,

06:19.226 --> 06:21.346
I knew that we were going
to have a little problem.

06:25.226 --> 06:26.166
Thank you.

06:26.166 --> 06:26.505
OK, bon appetit.

06:29.186 --> 06:30.000
A very dirty,
greasy, chipped plate,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.346
A very dirty,
greasy, chipped plate,

06:31.346 --> 06:36.326
and a big overgrown ball of
hair deep fat fried.

06:36.326 --> 06:38.356
I'll be  if I'm
eating that  for sure.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.226
As tough as old boots.

06:46.296 --> 06:47.346
God.

06:47.346 --> 06:48.286
Oh.

06:51.426 --> 06:52.456
Damn.

06:52.456 --> 06:53.396
Raw carrot.

06:53.396 --> 06:57.176
Fine if you're a  rabbit.

06:57.176 --> 06:57.515
How was your steak.

06:57.515 --> 06:59.196
Carrots were raw.

06:59.196 --> 07:00.000
Steak was tough, and that was
just a big ball of grease,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.376
Steak was tough, and that was
just a big ball of grease,

07:03.376 --> 07:10.406
and the plate was interesting,
especially with the chip.

07:10.406 --> 07:13.376
Gordon gave us a
scathing review.

07:13.376 --> 07:15.456
Thank you.

07:15.456 --> 07:16.406
It's lazy.

07:16.406 --> 07:19.306
It's dirty, and it's just bad.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.446
I mean, really crap.

07:20.446 --> 07:22.376
Your carrots were raw.

07:22.376 --> 07:26.266
Your steak was tough, and
your shoestring potatoes

07:26.266 --> 07:27.376
was a big ball of grease.

07:27.376 --> 07:29.356
A big ball of grease?

07:29.356 --> 07:30.000
Nightmare in grandma's
house.  me.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.356
Nightmare in grandma's
house.  me.

07:33.356 --> 07:35.186
Thank god she's dead.

07:35.186 --> 07:38.306
Michel definitely does
not respond to criticism.

07:38.306 --> 07:39.426
He likes to be the man.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.286
You seem proud of that food.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.226
You seem quite--

07:42.226 --> 07:43.336
-Yeah, I like it.
-You like it?

07:43.336 --> 07:44.296
Yeah, I think it's good.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.236
I mean--

07:45.236 --> 07:46.316
Don't take this personally.

07:46.316 --> 07:47.296
Yes.

07:47.296 --> 07:50.346
I thought your food was crap.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.266
Tasteless, bizarre.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.336
Your food was long
winded, boring,

07:53.336 --> 07:57.166
and just, you know, badly done.

07:57.166 --> 08:00.000
Honestly, I've never seen
anyone talk to Michel in

08:00.000 --> 08:00.216
Honestly, I've never seen
anyone talk to Michel in

08:00.216 --> 08:01.456
the way Ramsay talked to him.

08:01.456 --> 08:04.386
As a waitress, I don't get
complaints about the food.

08:04.386 --> 08:09.166
The only complaint I might
get is a food's cold.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.406
Jane, I'm not asking you to
blow smoke up his.

08:11.406 --> 08:14.306
I've just sat there
for the last hour

08:14.306 --> 08:16.186
and had one of the worst
meals I've ever eaten.

08:16.186 --> 08:18.226
That's a matter of opinion.

08:18.226 --> 08:19.336
God.

08:19.336 --> 08:21.316
Are you that  arrogant?

08:21.316 --> 08:22.336
A matter of opinion?

08:22.336 --> 08:23.406
No, I'm not being
that arrogant.

08:23.406 --> 08:25.276
If you're such a
passionate chef,

08:25.276 --> 08:27.406
and you are a natural because
you're French, and, you know,

08:27.406 --> 08:28.376
you love cooking--

08:28.376 --> 08:29.316
Yes.

08:29.316 --> 08:30.000
Why are you serving
tinned crab meat.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.356
Why are you serving
tinned crab meat.

08:32.356 --> 08:33.346
Tinned crab?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.396
The main reason is because
the restaurant is quiet.

08:36.396 --> 08:39.196
I buy fresh crab, it
goes bad really fast,

08:39.196 --> 08:41.406
so I have to buy
this-- this crab.

08:41.406 --> 08:42.456
I'm trying to get
inside your mind

08:42.456 --> 08:44.176
so I can start breaking down--

08:44.176 --> 08:44.555
OK.

08:44.555 --> 08:47.456
To how stupid you are.

08:47.456 --> 08:50.326
I don't think he likes Michel.

08:50.326 --> 08:52.416
We've got a lot of work to do
in a very short period of time.

08:52.416 --> 08:53.166
OK.

08:53.166 --> 08:53.505
That's fine.

08:53.505 --> 08:55.336
All I need is not some
form of French arrogance.

08:55.336 --> 08:58.296
I just need your support.

08:58.296 --> 09:00.000
And more importantly, your
honesty, but I don't feel

09:00.000 --> 09:00.266
And more importantly, your
honesty, but I don't feel

09:00.266 --> 09:01.206
you're honest.

09:01.206 --> 09:01.545
Oh, I'm honest.

09:01.545 --> 09:03.376
Thank For for that.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.236
Thank you for the critique.

09:05.236 --> 09:07.166
What an arrogant.

09:07.166 --> 09:12.176
He's so far up his own ,
he can't even breathe anymore.

09:12.176 --> 09:12.515
Coming up.

09:12.515 --> 09:13.436
Mold is festering.

09:13.436 --> 09:16.206
Gordon finds
the dirty little secrets.

09:19.266 --> 09:21.246
Leading to a fiery food fight.

09:21.246 --> 09:22.246
That's how you work.

09:22.246 --> 09:24.406
Is everything perfect
even in your kitchen?

09:24.406 --> 09:27.166
Don't you  dare
start lecturing me.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.000
And later, will
this French be the one to push

09:30.000 --> 09:30.276
And later, will
this French be the one to push

09:30.276 --> 09:32.326
Gordon Ramsay over the edge?

09:32.326 --> 09:34.256
Who the  are you
to turn around and tell

09:34.256 --> 09:35.386
me when you work like a pig?

09:35.386 --> 09:36.326
I--

09:36.326 --> 09:38.166
You,  pig!

09:50.206 --> 09:51.266
Day two.

09:51.266 --> 09:53.376
After being disappointed
with the food,

09:53.376 --> 09:56.286
Gordon now inspects the kitchen.

09:56.286 --> 09:58.166
OK, Michel's not here.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.286
I want to have a good
look around and just

09:59.286 --> 10:01.256
find out what's in the fridges.

10:01.256 --> 10:04.206
Ugh, that's now-- Ugh.

10:04.206 --> 10:06.196
When was the last
time that was cleaned?

10:06.196 --> 10:07.256
Oh my god.

10:07.256 --> 10:08.196
It's so dirty.

10:10.366 --> 10:11.306
Ugh.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.276
Ugh.

10:22.336 --> 10:23.406
My goodness me.

10:27.166 --> 10:30.366
The food's been in this fridge
for so long, even the fridge

10:30.366 --> 10:32.306
has now started to get moldy.

10:32.306 --> 10:34.376
Look just here.

10:34.376 --> 10:38.186
It's like mold caked on.

10:38.186 --> 10:41.206
This thing hasn't been
cleaned for years.

10:41.206 --> 10:42.186
Look.

10:42.186 --> 10:42.749
It's real mold.

10:42.749 --> 10:44.446
It's real mold.

10:44.446 --> 10:48.376
it's been here that long
even the bottle's moldy.

10:48.376 --> 10:51.336
Place is a health hazard.

10:51.336 --> 10:54.306
So potentially dangerous in
terms of poisoning someone.

10:54.306 --> 10:56.356
This place can't stay open.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.336
The place is disgusting.

11:03.406 --> 11:05.246
Oh, god.

11:19.436 --> 11:20.386
Hi, Gordon.

11:20.386 --> 11:21.326
Michel.

11:21.326 --> 11:22.406
How are you doing?

11:22.406 --> 11:24.456
Who organizes this place?

11:24.456 --> 11:26.196
The cooks and myself.

11:26.196 --> 11:27.446
When was the last time it
had a really good sort out?

11:31.266 --> 11:32.216
Yesterday.

11:32.216 --> 11:32.555
Yesterday?

11:32.555 --> 11:33.396
Yes.

11:33.396 --> 11:37.406
Look underneath here the
amount of mold that's growing.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.336
Look.

11:40.336 --> 11:42.749
It's really important that
you're honest with me.

11:42.749 --> 11:43.316
It's really important that
you're honest with me.

11:43.316 --> 11:46.246
Every time I say something to
you, all you do is smile at me.

11:46.246 --> 11:47.186
Because--

11:47.186 --> 11:48.386
When are you going
to get serious, Michel?

11:48.386 --> 11:49.456
I am.

11:49.456 --> 11:50.416
I am serious.

11:50.416 --> 11:53.286
Well, show me some
seriousness then, will you?

11:53.286 --> 11:54.416
Because if you were
serious, you wouldn't

11:54.416 --> 11:56.346
be having this up there.

11:56.346 --> 11:58.196
What the  is that?

12:01.256 --> 12:02.296
That's how you work?

12:02.296 --> 12:04.246
There's finger marks
in there were someone's

12:04.246 --> 12:05.346
gone in with their hands.

12:05.346 --> 12:07.276
That's how you work?

12:07.276 --> 12:08.246
Sometimes, yeah.

12:08.246 --> 12:09.296
Sometimes.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.256
You don't care anymore, do you?

12:11.256 --> 12:12.749
Is everything perfect
even in your kitchen?

12:12.749 --> 12:13.446
Is everything perfect
even in your kitchen?

12:13.446 --> 12:14.386
I don't think so.

12:14.386 --> 12:16.256
It's  clean.

12:16.256 --> 12:17.196
What do you mean?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.226
He's going with
the attitude that

12:18.226 --> 12:19.206
has no idea what's going on.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.196
Insults me.

12:20.196 --> 12:23.166
Tells me that he
doesn't have to,

12:23.166 --> 12:24.396
you know-- his
restaurant.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.206
I don't want you
to come and tell

12:26.206 --> 12:27.296
me how everything is awful.

12:27.296 --> 12:28.396
Look, you
hate the truth?

12:28.396 --> 12:29.446
No, I don't
hate the truth.

12:29.446 --> 12:30.336
You hate the truth.

12:30.336 --> 12:32.176
I don't want you to tell
me that everything is awful.

12:32.176 --> 12:32.515
You know what?

12:32.515 --> 12:35.356
I can give , too.

12:35.356 --> 12:36.386
How long?

12:36.386 --> 12:37.426
Listen.
Yeah. look.

12:37.426 --> 12:38.366
Let me--

12:38.366 --> 12:40.266
Thomas Keller doesn't
run a kitchen like this.

12:40.266 --> 12:41.206
No, he doesn't.

12:41.206 --> 12:42.749
Thomas Keller is one of the
most amazing chefs in America.

12:42.749 --> 12:43.456
Thomas Keller is one of the
most amazing chefs in America.

12:43.456 --> 12:45.416
He'd be  embarrassed
if he saw this?

12:45.416 --> 12:46.356
Maybe, maybe not.

12:46.356 --> 12:47.326
This is extraordinary.

12:47.326 --> 12:50.336
It was good for
him to be humbled.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.326
Michel was of the
opinion that, hey,

12:52.326 --> 12:54.426
if I want to serve dog
on a plate and the customer

12:54.426 --> 12:56.216
doesn't like it, too bad.

12:56.216 --> 12:58.456
The restaurant is not
doing that bad, OK?

12:58.456 --> 13:00.256
I make decent money.

13:00.256 --> 13:03.246
How much money have
you made in seven years?

13:03.246 --> 13:04.356
How much money
have I made where?

13:04.356 --> 13:06.436
In the restaurant
in seven years?

13:06.436 --> 13:07.436
What do you mean?

13:07.436 --> 13:12.166
How much money have
you made in seven years?

13:12.166 --> 13:12.505
Sorry.

13:12.505 --> 13:12.749
It's a big question.

13:12.749 --> 13:13.436
It's a big question.

13:13.436 --> 13:15.196
You need to make it smaller.

13:15.196 --> 13:17.266
How much profit have
you made in one year?

13:20.236 --> 13:22.246
You're hiding from me.

13:22.246 --> 13:23.316
No, not really, but--

13:23.316 --> 13:24.316
You don't want my help.

13:24.316 --> 13:25.386
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

13:25.386 --> 13:26.346
I want your help.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.436
I want your help, but you
know, I want good help.

13:28.436 --> 13:31.336
Don't  dare
start lecturing me

13:31.336 --> 13:33.416
what you want me to tell you.

13:33.416 --> 13:35.176
I'm here to help.

13:35.176 --> 13:37.376
The quicker you understand
that, the better for all of us.

13:37.376 --> 13:39.246
Right now, every time
I tell you something

13:39.246 --> 13:42.206
it's the man that's just
ignoring everything I say.

13:42.206 --> 13:42.749
I've met some stubborn
in my time,

13:42.749 --> 13:43.386
I've met some stubborn
in my time,

13:43.386 --> 13:44.386
but you take the piss.

13:52.426 --> 13:54.186
For the
rest of the day,

13:54.186 --> 13:56.416
The Secret Garden was
busier than usual--

13:56.416 --> 13:59.236
not cooking, but cleaning.

13:59.236 --> 14:00.336
Clean
kitchen, clean food.

14:00.336 --> 14:01.276
Yeah?

14:01.276 --> 14:03.406
I want it spotless.

14:03.406 --> 14:06.236
I think that the
kitchen looked gross.

14:09.356 --> 14:11.386
It's good to
see Michel scrubbing.

14:11.386 --> 14:12.749
He's beginning to show
some skills in the kitchen.

14:12.749 --> 14:13.396
He's beginning to show
some skills in the kitchen.

14:20.356 --> 14:22.256
Now that the
cleanliness of the kitchen

14:22.256 --> 14:25.226
is up to Gordon's standards,
it's time for him to check

14:25.226 --> 14:28.426
out a full dinner service.

14:28.426 --> 14:31.446
Well, maybe not a
full dinner service.

14:31.446 --> 14:35.176
The feeling when you walk
in and there's nothing,

14:35.176 --> 14:37.236
it's kind of like
a slap in the face.

14:39.436 --> 14:40.376
Good.

14:40.376 --> 14:41.336
Customers.

14:41.336 --> 14:42.749
A little on the stale side,
but customers nonetheless.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.336
A little on the stale side,
but customers nonetheless.

14:45.336 --> 14:49.316
What the hell kind of
puny appetizer is that?

14:49.316 --> 14:50.326
What is that, Michel?

14:50.326 --> 14:51.276
This is a canape.

14:51.276 --> 14:52.236
Canape?

14:52.236 --> 14:53.176
Yes.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.216
We've been doing
it for a while.

14:57.216 --> 14:58.406
People love it.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.186
Did you lot decide?

15:06.236 --> 15:08.186
OK, I'll
get those for you.

15:08.186 --> 15:09.416
Thank you.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.206
Can I have a potato
bisque, please?

15:14.186 --> 15:17.246
The food all takes too long to
cook, so when I take my order

15:17.246 --> 15:20.306
it will be at least 25 minutes
before it's on the table.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.266
My belief is, you
know, it's nice to sit

15:22.266 --> 15:23.246
down and enjoy yourself.

15:23.246 --> 15:25.286
Spend two, three
hours in a restaurant.

15:25.286 --> 15:28.296
That's a difference
between America and France.

15:28.296 --> 15:30.256
People eat a lot slower in
France than they eat America.

15:30.256 --> 15:30.600
In America--.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.296
As customers
continue to wait,

15:36.296 --> 15:39.306
Gordon's discovered Michel's
over complicated dishes

15:39.306 --> 15:42.326
are taking too long to prepare.

15:42.326 --> 15:42.749
Michel,
you're fascinated

15:42.749 --> 15:43.386
Michel,
you're fascinated

15:43.386 --> 15:50.246
by crusted items and
stuffing things, aren't you?

15:50.246 --> 15:52.386
Look at the menu.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.426
Macadamia nut mahi mahi.

15:54.426 --> 15:56.336
Crusted.

15:56.336 --> 15:57.326
The scallops.

15:57.326 --> 15:58.376
Crusted.

15:58.376 --> 16:01.196
You can have the chili
garlic crusted salmon.

16:01.196 --> 16:02.296
Crusted.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.256
Soft chicken.

16:03.256 --> 16:04.196
Crusted.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.166
-The pork chop.
-Crusted.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.246
And then the fillet.
That's--

16:07.246 --> 16:08.186
Stuffed.

16:08.186 --> 16:09.166
I like good food.

16:09.166 --> 16:09.538
I like rich food.

16:13.366 --> 16:14.386
It's a matter of opinion.

16:14.386 --> 16:16.366
You know, nobody likes
everything everybody does.

16:20.406 --> 16:24.336
Oh dear, it's going
to be a long night.

16:24.336 --> 16:27.286
God, this guy is
unbelievable.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.256
You know, there's one
thing about being bad.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.286
That's solvable, but
being in complete denial

16:32.286 --> 16:34.276
throughout-- it's extraordinary.

16:34.276 --> 16:38.266
I've never met such a
hard ass stubborn

16:38.266 --> 16:39.296
in all my life.

16:42.336 --> 16:42.749
This is going
to be way overcooked.

16:42.749 --> 16:43.456
This is going
to be way overcooked.

16:43.456 --> 16:45.436
-No.
-Medium rare.

16:45.436 --> 16:46.376
Cooked perfect.

16:46.376 --> 16:48.326
Even with few
diners in the dining room,

16:48.326 --> 16:50.416
Michel's stubbornness
continues to create

16:50.416 --> 16:53.366
problems in the kitchen.

16:53.366 --> 16:55.316
Actually what table is
it on the fillet pickup?

16:55.316 --> 16:57.256
That's the
soup you ordered.

16:57.256 --> 16:58.206
Are we picking up seven?

17:00.386 --> 17:05.166
Michel wants to be
the star of the show.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.396
I could have been
doing so much more,

17:06.396 --> 17:08.326
but the Michel wouldn't let me.

17:08.326 --> 17:11.176
I got you.

17:11.176 --> 17:12.749
If a chef is to good, Michel
does get a bit jealous.

17:12.749 --> 17:14.226
If a chef is to good, Michel
does get a bit jealous.

17:14.226 --> 17:16.166
I'm gonna go see what's
happening in the dining room.

17:18.366 --> 17:21.176
With Michel headed
towards the dining room,

17:21.176 --> 17:23.316
sous chef Devon takes over.

17:23.316 --> 17:24.316
I know what I'm doing.

17:24.316 --> 17:28.376
I'm a machine, and I'm
all over the place.

17:28.376 --> 17:32.386
And the food
is finally getting out.

17:32.386 --> 17:36.226
But where is Michel?

17:36.226 --> 17:37.316
First time or you've
been here before?

17:37.316 --> 17:38.256
Yes, it is.

17:38.256 --> 17:39.336
First time?

17:39.336 --> 17:42.416
I like to go to the customers
because it's great for my ego.

17:42.416 --> 17:42.749
What are we drinking?

17:42.749 --> 17:44.296
What are we drinking?

17:44.296 --> 17:45.316
Oh, pinot noir.

17:45.316 --> 17:46.316
Yeah, I forgot.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.286
I think I know the guy
that sells that wine.

17:49.286 --> 17:53.316
Michel does tend to
talk an awful lot.

17:53.316 --> 17:54.316
Yeah.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.446
I hope it's good.

17:55.446 --> 17:56.396
Nothing's consistent.

17:56.396 --> 17:58.206
No one's taken anything.

17:58.206 --> 18:01.266
No one has got any passion, and
Is thing the French have got,

18:01.266 --> 18:02.206
it's passion.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.366
Here zero.

18:05.366 --> 18:07.326
After
observing dinner service,

18:07.326 --> 18:10.306
Gordon has come to a conclusion.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.749
OK, so let me tell
you what I have

18:12.749 --> 18:14.366
OK, so let me tell
you what I have

18:14.366 --> 18:16.366
seen and witnessed all day.

18:16.366 --> 18:20.436
I've seen a man that I think is
far more in love with himself

18:20.436 --> 18:23.396
than he is with his restaurant.

18:23.396 --> 18:25.316
Tomorrow we start
working together.

18:25.316 --> 18:26.256
No arguing.

18:26.256 --> 18:27.286
Clear understanding.

18:27.286 --> 18:30.326
Chef to chef, and I want
to see some passion.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.176
Do you understand the
word passion, because I

18:32.176 --> 18:33.306
haven't seen any of it.

18:33.306 --> 18:35.276
He tells me that I don't
give a  about people.

18:35.276 --> 18:37.176
I care only about myself.

18:37.176 --> 18:37.555
This is all.

18:37.555 --> 18:40.196
You can do much better.

18:40.196 --> 18:42.749
This is all.

18:42.749 --> 18:44.186
This is all.

18:44.186 --> 18:44.525
Coming up.

18:44.525 --> 18:46.186
Have all the
specials gone, Michel?

18:46.186 --> 18:49.226
Chaos in the
kitchen has Gordon seeing red.

18:49.226 --> 18:50.366
Any food?

18:50.366 --> 18:52.176
Is this table four.

18:52.176 --> 18:52.548
I don't have it.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.206
It is, quite frankly, the
most disorganized restaurant.

18:55.206 --> 18:56.446
How was your appetizer?

18:56.446 --> 18:58.216
I never received it.

18:58.216 --> 18:58.555
It's pathetic.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.396
It's embarrassing.

18:59.396 --> 19:01.436
Who the  are you
to turn around and tell

19:01.436 --> 19:04.186
me when you work like a pig?

19:04.186 --> 19:04.525
Yeah.

19:04.525 --> 19:06.196
You,  pig.

19:06.196 --> 19:07.256
And is
The Secret Garden

19:07.256 --> 19:09.386
doomed to be a secret forever?

19:20.436 --> 19:22.216
Day three.

19:22.216 --> 19:25.256
Gordon is determined to get
through to this stubborn chef

19:25.256 --> 19:27.246
with help from a
little shock therapy.

19:32.436 --> 19:34.296
OK, new day, and I'm
determined that this guy

19:34.296 --> 19:35.406
is going to finally
start listening

19:35.406 --> 19:36.366
to what I'm trying to say.

19:36.366 --> 19:38.296
So this morning I've
shut the place down.

19:38.296 --> 19:39.236
I've boarded it up.

19:39.236 --> 19:41.336
I'm going to make him understand
if he doesn't start changing

19:41.336 --> 19:43.853
and listening to what I'm trying
to say that's the end result.

19:43.853 --> 19:45.306
and listening to what I'm trying
to say that's the end result.

19:45.306 --> 19:47.206
And that's a sign no
restaurant wants to see.

20:03.246 --> 20:05.356
I'm not closing down.

20:05.356 --> 20:08.286
This.

20:08.286 --> 20:09.306
Good morning.

20:09.306 --> 20:10.316
This is not funny.

20:10.316 --> 20:11.336
I'm pissed.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.396
-Good.
-Good.

20:12.396 --> 20:13.853
You've got every
reason to be pissed.

20:13.853 --> 20:14.166
You've got every
reason to be pissed.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.176
I'm glad you're angry.
-Yeah.

20:15.176 --> 20:16.226
Finally woken up.

20:16.226 --> 20:17.346
Now I've done
this for a reason.

20:17.346 --> 20:23.166
Just think how bad it would
be for your business to close.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.216
I don't see
anything constructive here.

20:25.216 --> 20:26.246
It's a small town.

20:26.246 --> 20:27.406
10 people drove
by and guess what?

20:27.406 --> 20:29.216
They're going to be
advertising on TV,

20:29.216 --> 20:32.216
oh, the restaurant
is not doing well.

20:32.216 --> 20:33.276
OK, let's go, big boy.

20:33.276 --> 20:35.316
If the restaurant
were to close down,

20:35.316 --> 20:36.456
I don't know what I would do.

20:36.456 --> 20:39.306
I'd feel almost ashamed.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.346
But for
this restaurant

20:40.346 --> 20:43.436
to truly turn around,
it starts with the menu.

20:43.436 --> 20:43.853
Simple food.

20:43.853 --> 20:44.416
Simple food.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.356
No frills.

20:45.356 --> 20:46.296
Straightforward.

20:46.296 --> 20:48.316
Good flavor and getting
customers coming back

20:48.316 --> 20:50.276
once a week, not once a year.

20:53.326 --> 20:54.296
Hey, everybody.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.366
Every time we touch
something tonight

20:55.366 --> 20:56.326
we're going to be tasting.

20:56.326 --> 20:57.306
Yes, chef.

20:57.306 --> 20:58.266
Everything.

20:58.266 --> 20:59.426
Now Gordon
is going to teach

20:59.426 --> 21:03.346
Michel some simple, moneymaking
specials to put on the menu.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.406
OK, the first dish is
going to be a roast chicken.

21:05.406 --> 21:07.286
Roasted, simple, and bang, out.

21:07.286 --> 21:08.226
Yeah?

21:08.226 --> 21:09.366
Nothing fancy.

21:09.366 --> 21:10.366
Nice and easy.

21:10.366 --> 21:12.286
There's a lot of things
just because we've

21:12.286 --> 21:13.853
been doing them forever
does not mean we've

21:13.853 --> 21:14.266
been doing them forever
does not mean we've

21:14.266 --> 21:16.216
been doing them the right way.

21:16.216 --> 21:17.356
Nothing too expensive.

21:17.356 --> 21:20.276
That's not difficult,
is it guys?

21:20.276 --> 21:26.296
Try to simplify, and we work
faster, cleaner, and better.

21:26.296 --> 21:28.316
There are the four specials.

21:28.316 --> 21:32.376
Onion gratin, tuna
nicoise, roasted chicken,

21:32.376 --> 21:36.236
and a fresh, local
asparagus warm tart.

21:36.236 --> 21:37.266
Yes?

21:37.266 --> 21:38.246
Any questions?

21:38.246 --> 21:40.226
Is he the great cook?

21:40.226 --> 21:41.166
No.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.196
I was voted best chef
in Conejo Valley.

21:51.296 --> 21:54.166
Saturday night is
the one night that The Secret

21:54.166 --> 21:56.306
Garden is busy
and a perfect time

21:56.306 --> 21:57.446
to test Gordon's new specials.

21:57.446 --> 22:01.316
I've got some fantastic
specials to tell you about.

22:01.316 --> 22:02.326
Tuna nicoise.

22:02.326 --> 22:04.186
A warm asparagus tart.

22:04.186 --> 22:04.535
A roasted chicken.

22:04.535 --> 22:06.166
It's very moist.

22:06.166 --> 22:06.505
It's very good.

22:06.505 --> 22:09.406
It's all crisp
and very delicious.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.366
We've got some customers
in under the age of 50.

22:11.366 --> 22:13.296
It's exciting.

22:13.296 --> 22:13.853
And what can I
get for you, sir?

22:13.853 --> 22:15.216
And what can I
get for you, sir?

22:15.216 --> 22:16.416
The French onion
soup, the special.

22:16.416 --> 22:18.216
The special.

22:18.216 --> 22:19.226
The asparagus tart.

22:19.226 --> 22:20.266
Oh, music to my ears.

22:20.266 --> 22:21.286
Right here, please.

22:21.286 --> 22:22.226
Right away.

22:22.226 --> 22:23.166
Table 43.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.216
How was everything?

22:24.216 --> 22:24.555
It was excellent.

22:24.555 --> 22:25.426
It was so good.

22:25.426 --> 22:26.386
Oh my.

22:26.386 --> 22:29.306
It was the perfect tenderness,
and it was the perfect size.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.316
Gordon Ramsay
is brilliant,

22:35.316 --> 22:37.456
because the responses I
got off all my customers

22:37.456 --> 22:40.216
is the food is great here.

22:40.216 --> 22:41.186
We love it.

22:41.186 --> 22:41.525
Cheers.

22:41.525 --> 22:43.376
Cheers.

22:43.376 --> 22:43.853
Over an hour into
meal service, and the specials

22:43.853 --> 22:46.246
Over an hour into
meal service, and the specials

22:46.246 --> 22:49.266
are proving to be very popular,
but orders are starting

22:49.266 --> 22:50.386
- to back up in the kitchen.
- 24.

22:50.386 --> 22:52.176
- I need table three.
- No, no, no.

22:52.176 --> 22:52.515
Not yet.

22:52.515 --> 22:54.446
Is this table four?

22:54.446 --> 22:56.326
Is this table four?

22:56.326 --> 22:57.266
Table four?

22:57.266 --> 22:58.236
What is table four?

22:58.236 --> 22:59.216
Is this table four?

22:59.216 --> 23:00.186
I don't know?

23:00.186 --> 23:01.176
It's not table four.

23:01.176 --> 23:03.316
People was making
mistakes on which

23:03.316 --> 23:04.386
tables to run the food to.

23:04.386 --> 23:05.326
This is not right.

23:05.326 --> 23:06.276
This is not right.

23:06.276 --> 23:07.386
Are they communicating
with you, Michel?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.376
No.

23:08.376 --> 23:10.316
They're talking too
much, not communicating.

23:10.316 --> 23:11.366
No, that's good.

23:11.366 --> 23:12.326
All right.

23:12.326 --> 23:13.853
Table 16 is going to
order something else, OK?

23:13.853 --> 23:15.186
Table 16 is going to
order something else, OK?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.236
Let me worry about it.

23:16.236 --> 23:18.186
You told me already you
were going to comp it,

23:18.186 --> 23:18.535
and they have to leave.

23:18.535 --> 23:20.396
We've been here for
like an hour and a half

23:20.396 --> 23:21.336
and haven't eaten.

23:21.336 --> 23:22.276
I know.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.316
I'm going to say-- the
communication wasn't

23:24.316 --> 23:25.306
quite there from the kitchen.

23:29.406 --> 23:31.216
And no one
is communicating.

23:31.216 --> 23:32.396
Will you tell her that
you have nothing left?

23:32.396 --> 23:34.276
They're still ordering them.

23:34.276 --> 23:35.396
Yeah, I don't
know what happened.

23:35.396 --> 23:37.236
I've got some specials
to tell you about.

23:37.236 --> 23:39.166
We've got a warm asparagus tart.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.296
It's topped with a mixed greens.

23:40.296 --> 23:41.236
Very delicious.

23:41.236 --> 23:43.176
The specials already
sold out within 40

23:43.176 --> 23:43.853
minutes of being
on the menu, and

23:43.853 --> 23:44.246
minutes of being
on the menu, and

23:44.246 --> 23:45.346
now Michel's not communicating.

23:45.346 --> 23:49.196
They're ordering food, and
we haven't even got it.

23:49.196 --> 23:53.246
I have an asparagus tart that
was ordered for table two.

23:53.246 --> 23:54.336
I don't have it.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.416
What else is 86'd
I don't know about.

23:59.416 --> 24:02.376
Let me worry about it.

24:02.376 --> 24:07.266
Who's in charge of that
dining room out there?

24:07.266 --> 24:10.286
Chaos in the kitchen
has resulted in angry customers

24:10.286 --> 24:11.266
in the dining room.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.416
How was your appetizer?

24:12.416 --> 24:13.853
I never received it.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.216
I never received it.

24:14.216 --> 24:15.276
Oh, you
haven't received it?

24:15.276 --> 24:16.286
Why not?

24:16.286 --> 24:17.226
No?

24:17.226 --> 24:18.176
I keep asking.

24:18.176 --> 24:19.246
I'm getting a little cranky.

24:19.246 --> 24:22.436
Even though it's the kitchen's
fault, we take the brunt of it,

24:22.436 --> 24:24.256
and we take the
brunt of the anger.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.396
I can only hope
that you forgive us.

24:25.396 --> 24:27.356
I know that you haven't
had your entree yet.

24:27.356 --> 24:29.306
Customers were pissed.

24:29.306 --> 24:31.396
They were really,
really pissed at us.

24:31.396 --> 24:32.366
Send a manager.

24:32.366 --> 24:34.236
Send a manager out here.

24:34.236 --> 24:35.216
Yeah.

24:35.216 --> 24:36.196
Send a manager.

24:36.196 --> 24:37.286
It's cold.

24:37.286 --> 24:41.326
Listen, all I can do at this
point is give you your food.

24:41.326 --> 24:42.446
I can't do anything else.

24:46.166 --> 24:47.246
And now,
instead of turning

24:47.246 --> 24:50.306
a profit with their new specials
they're giving food away.

24:50.306 --> 24:51.346
Yeah, you know what?

24:51.346 --> 24:53.336
You're going to have to
hold back five minutes.

24:53.336 --> 24:54.346
It was just chaos.

24:54.346 --> 24:56.196
Everybody panicked.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.356
I'm getting frustrated.

24:58.356 --> 24:59.436
You want to push
me in the kitchen,

24:59.436 --> 25:02.186
I will scream at everybody.

25:02.186 --> 25:03.286
So wait five minutes.

25:03.286 --> 25:07.276
When I lose my temper,
it's time for you to urn.

25:07.276 --> 25:09.356
Let me worry about it.

25:09.356 --> 25:10.296
What-- are we--

25:10.296 --> 25:11.376
You know what?
Serve the food.

25:11.376 --> 25:12.316
I don't care.

25:12.316 --> 25:13.396
Serve that.

25:13.396 --> 25:13.853
Michel is just glowering
at me the whole damn day,

25:13.853 --> 25:17.166
Michel is just glowering
at me the whole damn day,

25:17.166 --> 25:18.216
and I didn't deserve it.

25:22.226 --> 25:23.166
Won't have anymore?

25:23.166 --> 25:25.366
It's a bit demoralizing
when he's like that.

25:25.366 --> 25:28.296
As soon as it's ready, OK?

25:28.296 --> 25:29.276
Go get out.

25:29.276 --> 25:31.176
Go In the dining room,
take care of the customers.

25:31.176 --> 25:33.276
It is, quite frankly,
the most disorganized

25:33.276 --> 25:36.216
restaurant in America tonight.

25:36.216 --> 25:37.306
Pick up!

25:37.306 --> 25:39.296
Jane.

25:39.296 --> 25:40.266
I'm loaded over.
No.

25:40.266 --> 25:41.236
No.
No.

25:41.236 --> 25:42.206
No.
No.

25:42.206 --> 25:42.545
Damn it!

25:42.545 --> 25:43.386
Come here.

25:43.386 --> 25:43.853
You have no guts.

25:43.853 --> 25:44.326
You have no guts.

25:44.326 --> 25:45.266
Where's Jane?

25:48.326 --> 25:49.336
Jane's not OK.

25:49.336 --> 25:51.426
It all got blown up
in our face today.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.246
I just am a little
bit overwhelmed.

25:53.246 --> 25:54.186
What table?

25:54.186 --> 25:55.356
Whatever the table is.

25:55.356 --> 25:58.406
They we were getting their
handed to them.

25:58.406 --> 26:00.456
I'm mad, because everyone's
gotten their entree,

26:00.456 --> 26:02.256
and I haven't gotten anything.

26:02.256 --> 26:05.396
It's tough.

26:05.396 --> 26:06.396
You know what?

26:06.396 --> 26:10.386
Cause I'm going
to find a manager.

26:10.386 --> 26:13.853
To me, this is the lowest
day of this restaurant's life.

26:13.853 --> 26:14.226
To me, this is the lowest
day of this restaurant's life.

26:14.226 --> 26:15.376
It's up now.

26:18.216 --> 26:20.366
Still ahead, when
customers mow down the door--

26:20.366 --> 26:22.356
Where there's a
will, there's a way.

26:22.356 --> 26:24.356
Michel struggles
to stay out of the weeds.

26:24.356 --> 26:25.356
I'm getting frustrated.

26:25.356 --> 26:27.196
Oh, come on.

26:27.196 --> 26:28.346
But old
habits die hard.

26:28.346 --> 26:30.326
You run a
hole of a kitchen.

26:30.326 --> 26:31.336
And Gordon loses it.

26:31.336 --> 26:33.336
Oh, I have a  kitchen?

26:33.336 --> 26:34.336
Yeah, is it?

26:34.336 --> 26:35.306
Well, it's your kitchen.

26:35.306 --> 26:36.326
Then clean it, you lazy!

26:36.326 --> 26:37.266
No!

26:47.822 --> 26:48.822
Jane?

26:48.822 --> 26:50.662
Janes' not OK.

26:50.662 --> 26:51.662
No, no, no, no, no.

26:51.662 --> 26:53.532
Where is Jane?

26:53.532 --> 26:55.722
To me, this is the lowest
day of this restaurant's life.

26:55.722 --> 26:56.682
Kitchen is closed.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.682
Come on.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.682
Out.

27:00.682 --> 27:02.762
Even though Gordon's
new specials got them off

27:02.762 --> 27:06.732
to a good start, the dinner
service ended in disaster,

27:06.732 --> 27:09.642
and Michel and his
staff were exposed.

27:09.642 --> 27:13.035
I observed tonight, and
I was watching everything.

27:13.035 --> 27:13.732
I observed tonight, and
I was watching everything.

27:13.732 --> 27:16.752
Waiters were picking up food
that didn't belong to them,

27:16.752 --> 27:20.632
taking orders with specials
on them that we no longer had.

27:20.632 --> 27:22.642
Communication, Michel, was zero.

27:25.542 --> 27:28.582
I think everybody can
communicate properly over here.

27:28.582 --> 27:31.592
There was no control, Michel.

27:31.592 --> 27:32.742
This is all , OK?

27:32.742 --> 27:35.652
My restaurant is doing
better than this.

27:35.652 --> 27:38.802
Do you think this
is a  game?

27:38.802 --> 27:39.772
Let me tell you.

27:39.772 --> 27:41.552
Now, my thing is--

27:41.552 --> 27:43.035
Shut up!

27:43.035 --> 27:43.722
Shut up!

27:43.722 --> 27:44.742
Enough for tonight.

27:44.742 --> 27:47.642
I want to move on.

27:47.642 --> 27:49.532
We will make this a success.

28:02.582 --> 28:03.792
Day
four-- relaunch day,

28:03.792 --> 28:07.532
and time for Gordon to
start implementing his plan,

28:07.532 --> 28:10.642
starting with The Secret
Garden's outdated decor.

28:10.642 --> 28:11.582
Look around.

28:15.722 --> 28:19.742
This is like walking
into a funeral parlor.

28:19.742 --> 28:21.682
What does this do
in a restaurant?

28:21.682 --> 28:22.762
Look at the mess of it.

28:22.762 --> 28:25.562
I think it gives the
charm of the antique.

28:25.562 --> 28:26.662
It's not.

28:26.662 --> 28:27.762
This is going.

28:27.762 --> 28:29.532
That is going.

28:29.532 --> 28:30.572
I want to get rid of that stuff.

28:30.572 --> 28:30.911
Here we go.

28:30.911 --> 28:32.682
The chef right behind you there.

28:32.682 --> 28:34.672
I'm opening up your eyes.

28:34.672 --> 28:35.792
I'm making the
room more spacious.

28:35.792 --> 28:36.732
I don't like it.

28:36.732 --> 28:37.822
You don't like it?

28:37.822 --> 28:39.822
No.

28:39.822 --> 28:42.812
Bye, grandma.

28:42.812 --> 28:43.035
Next step,
Gordon's design team

28:43.035 --> 28:45.582
Next step,
Gordon's design team

28:45.582 --> 28:48.672
moves in to bring the restaurant
into the 21st century,

28:48.672 --> 28:50.772
redecorating the
dining room, replacing

28:50.772 --> 28:53.702
the old fashioned sign, and
restoring the main entrance.

28:57.592 --> 28:58.572
OK, good.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.612
New menu.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.682
Unstuffy dining room.

29:00.682 --> 29:02.552
Big, big, big night tonight.

29:02.552 --> 29:04.822
Now get in here, Chef
Michel, with your team,

29:04.822 --> 29:06.612
and look at your new decor.

29:10.612 --> 29:11.552
Very pretty.

29:11.552 --> 29:13.035
Oh my goodness.

29:13.035 --> 29:13.532
Oh my goodness.

29:13.532 --> 29:14.672
This is gorgeous.

29:20.812 --> 29:21.782
The room is bigger.

29:21.782 --> 29:25.562
We've got depth, and
we've got clarity.

29:25.562 --> 29:25.901
There's no clutter.

29:25.901 --> 29:28.532
How beautiful.

29:28.532 --> 29:30.722
Michel,
first impressions?

29:30.722 --> 29:31.662
Completely different.

29:37.792 --> 29:39.742
Do you think the
dining room looks younger?

29:39.742 --> 29:40.712
- Yes, it does.
- Yes.

29:40.712 --> 29:41.762
Are you
worried about that?

29:41.762 --> 29:42.712
Uh, big time.

29:42.712 --> 29:43.035
I don't want to destroy
the what I have.

29:43.035 --> 29:44.592
I don't want to destroy
the what I have.

29:44.592 --> 29:45.782
I want to improve what I have.

29:45.782 --> 29:48.732
Can you give me two minutes
please with chef Michel?

29:48.732 --> 29:50.572
The few
customers that we have,

29:50.572 --> 29:50.911
I think they're
going to come in.

29:50.911 --> 29:52.712
They're going to go, you
know, this is different.

29:52.712 --> 29:53.652
I don't like it.

29:53.652 --> 29:56.572
Instead of helping my business,
you might hurt my business.

29:56.572 --> 29:57.652
Give me a chance.

29:57.652 --> 29:59.682
Give me a  chance.

29:59.682 --> 30:01.602
I'm not too crazy
about the changes,

30:01.602 --> 30:02.802
but let's see what
he can do, what

30:02.802 --> 30:04.672
he can bring to the restaurant.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.742
With only a
few hours to the relaunch

30:06.742 --> 30:09.752
of the restaurant Gordon
unveils the most important

30:09.752 --> 30:11.652
part of his plan, the menu.

30:11.652 --> 30:13.035
We'll go through it together.

30:13.035 --> 30:13.632
We'll go through it together.

30:13.632 --> 30:15.542
For tonight's
dinner service,

30:15.542 --> 30:18.642
gone are the crusted dishes,
stuffed dishes, and the garlic

30:18.642 --> 30:20.712
shrimp and strawberry salad.

30:20.712 --> 30:21.812
And in their place are--

30:21.812 --> 30:24.672
I've done the fillet
mignon, the tuna nicoise,

30:24.672 --> 30:26.822
the local beet salad, the pan
roasted chicken breast, and

30:26.822 --> 30:28.642
then the double cut pork chop.

30:28.642 --> 30:29.672
And any questions on the menu?

30:29.672 --> 30:30.612
That's brilliant.

30:30.612 --> 30:31.552
I know.

30:31.552 --> 30:33.552
That's a brilliant idea.

30:33.552 --> 30:35.742
I was concerned with that
menu because, you know,

30:35.742 --> 30:38.752
I'm used to my old menu,
and I'm sure people

30:38.752 --> 30:41.612
are going to ask for it.

30:41.612 --> 30:43.035
For tonight's
grand reopening,

30:43.035 --> 30:43.712
For tonight's
grand reopening,

30:43.712 --> 30:46.762
Gordon has invited local
celebrities, and dignitaries,

30:46.762 --> 30:49.612
and one very influential guest.

30:49.612 --> 30:50.812
Big, big, night, yes?

30:50.812 --> 30:53.542
Tonight is the beginning
of a new chapter

30:53.542 --> 30:54.542
in Secret Garden's, yes?

30:54.542 --> 30:55.622
Tonight is the night.

30:55.622 --> 30:57.672
We set the standards,
tonight, yes?

30:57.672 --> 31:00.592
If we do get busy,
we do not panic.

31:00.592 --> 31:01.572
All right.

31:01.572 --> 31:01.911
Now.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.672
Knowing that there was
a food critic, I was nervous.

31:10.672 --> 31:12.782
I mean, this is not
going to be Michel.

31:12.782 --> 31:13.035
This is different.

31:13.035 --> 31:14.562
This is different.

31:14.562 --> 31:15.562
What are they going to say?

31:15.562 --> 31:16.762
How they going to like it?

31:16.762 --> 31:18.532
You don't know.

31:18.532 --> 31:18.881
Good luck, everybody.

31:24.602 --> 31:26.762
Now that Gordon's
plan has been put into effect,

31:26.762 --> 31:30.742
it's up to Michel and
his staff to execute.

31:30.742 --> 31:32.532
We have a reservation for Lisa.

31:35.582 --> 31:36.792
Finally some life
in this place.

31:36.792 --> 31:37.732
Hallelujah.

31:37.732 --> 31:40.602
Table seven, tuna
and soup, let's go.

31:40.602 --> 31:42.612
I was nervous.

31:42.612 --> 31:43.035
This is an important night.

31:43.035 --> 31:43.772
This is an important night.

31:43.772 --> 31:45.812
We have important people
in the restaurant.

31:45.812 --> 31:47.782
Miss California
has just turned up.

31:47.782 --> 31:50.552
Wow.

31:50.552 --> 31:53.682
Mike, table six only half
of the appetizers are gone.

31:53.682 --> 31:56.662
It is so important to keep
our cool in the kitchen

31:56.662 --> 31:58.612
because that's when
it's difficult.

31:58.612 --> 31:59.652
Are you listening, Mike?

31:59.652 --> 32:02.812
And that's when you
make the mistakes.

32:02.812 --> 32:06.542
With a sudden
rush of customers,

32:06.542 --> 32:08.762
Michel's nerves are
being put to the test.

32:08.762 --> 32:10.762
We got a bus or 24
people that came.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.702
Unexpectedly--

32:13.732 --> 32:17.732
--from a local vineyard,
so it's caused pandemonium.

32:17.732 --> 32:19.762
Michel, can you make sure they
don't start panicking now.

32:19.762 --> 32:20.702
Yes.

32:20.702 --> 32:23.632
We're right in the middle of
this crucial  night.

32:23.632 --> 32:24.612
Just go over there.

32:24.612 --> 32:25.702
I need to get cooking now.
Thank you.

32:25.702 --> 32:26.642
Not tonight, guys, yes?

32:26.642 --> 32:28.662
Quiet in the kitchen tonight.

32:28.662 --> 32:31.622
If Gordon gets in my
way-- give me the knife.

32:31.622 --> 32:33.562
I'll take care of it-- I
promise I'll make him suffer.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.532
It's relaunch
night at The Secret Garden,

32:44.532 --> 32:45.772
and the onslaught
of new customers

32:45.772 --> 32:48.592
is putting Michel and
his team to the test.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.672
Mike, come right here, please.

32:50.672 --> 32:51.612
Right away.

32:51.612 --> 32:52.672
This is an important night.

32:52.672 --> 32:53.642
We have food critics.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.672
We have important people
in the restaurant.

32:55.672 --> 32:56.732
We cannot fall apart.

32:56.732 --> 32:57.672
Unexpectedly--

32:59.582 --> 33:02.562
--from a local vineyard,
so it's caused pandemonium.

33:02.562 --> 33:04.692
A bus of 24 people that came?

33:07.782 --> 33:08.256
It's craziness.

33:08.256 --> 33:08.772
It's craziness.

33:08.772 --> 33:10.692
It's-- it's happening.

33:10.692 --> 33:11.632
Seven.

33:11.632 --> 33:12.572
Onion soup order in.

33:12.572 --> 33:13.722
Onion soup order in.

33:17.652 --> 33:19.732
Michel has
cleared his first hurdle,

33:19.732 --> 33:22.682
and the rush of customers
has been taken care of,

33:22.682 --> 33:27.642
but The Secret Garden
faces another challenge.

33:27.642 --> 33:30.552
Jane, have you spotted
a food critic yet?

33:30.552 --> 33:31.592
Any idea who she is?

33:31.592 --> 33:32.532
No?

33:32.532 --> 33:35.552
Yeah, she's actually-- she's
actually on a table of five

33:35.552 --> 33:35.891
now.

33:35.891 --> 33:36.802
She's joined four other people.

33:36.802 --> 33:38.256
Oh really?

33:38.256 --> 33:38.702
Oh really?

33:38.702 --> 33:39.642
Yes.

33:43.542 --> 33:44.652
Order in, chef.

33:44.652 --> 33:45.592
Bring it here.

33:45.592 --> 33:46.702
That's for the
food critic table.

33:46.702 --> 33:49.702
OK, in one minute.

33:49.702 --> 33:50.642
Tuna.

33:56.822 --> 33:59.572
Take that out.

34:29.672 --> 34:30.642
And over seasoned.

34:30.642 --> 34:32.582
It was just over seasoned.

34:32.582 --> 34:33.542
Thank you very much.

34:33.542 --> 34:33.914
Thank you.

34:37.652 --> 34:38.256
Oh, no.

34:38.256 --> 34:38.622
Oh, no.

34:38.622 --> 34:39.802
No, no.  off.
No.

34:39.802 --> 34:41.712
It was salty, and--
What's that, the tuna?

34:41.712 --> 34:42.822
-The tuna.
-Michel?

34:42.822 --> 34:44.552
I don't know what happened.

34:44.552 --> 34:45.562
Come on, guys.

34:45.562 --> 34:48.672
When some of the food came
back, the tuna was over salty.

34:48.672 --> 34:49.672
I was sweating.

34:49.672 --> 34:50.632
I was shivering.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.572
No, but let's offer them
something else instead.

34:52.572 --> 34:52.944
I did.

34:52.944 --> 34:55.562
They don't want anything else.

34:55.562 --> 34:58.612
The new menu-- it's good,
but it's not good enough.

34:58.612 --> 34:59.662
We have to make it good enough.

34:59.662 --> 35:00.672
Yeah, I apologize for that.

35:00.672 --> 35:02.792
If I give you one of
my signature dish,

35:02.792 --> 35:05.672
on are going to make you
feel a little bit better.

35:05.672 --> 35:07.742
You know, something just
to balance the tartness.

35:07.742 --> 35:08.256
You know, the--
Uh-huh.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.532
You know, the--
Uh-huh.

35:09.532 --> 35:09.904
Thank you very much.

35:09.904 --> 35:11.632
Thank you for giving
me another chance.

35:11.632 --> 35:12.772
I'll get a little
more used to the menu.

35:12.772 --> 35:14.592
It's a brand new
menu for me, also.

35:14.592 --> 35:15.802
Not an excuse, but it's
always a little harder.

35:15.802 --> 35:16.822
-Yes.
-So, thank you.

35:16.822 --> 35:17.762
Thank you.

35:17.762 --> 35:18.712
Thank you.

35:18.712 --> 35:19.732
Thanks.

35:19.732 --> 35:20.762
I'm pissed.
Come on.

35:20.762 --> 35:21.702
That's his food.

35:21.702 --> 35:22.762
He's the one sending it out.

35:26.772 --> 35:29.652
Gordon, your menu is
not better than mine.

35:29.652 --> 35:32.602
Oh, , no.

35:32.602 --> 35:34.682
After over
seasoning the tuna,

35:34.682 --> 35:36.742
Michel is abandoning
the new menu.

35:36.742 --> 35:38.256
He's now preparing to send
his stuffed fillet of beef,

35:38.256 --> 35:39.712
He's now preparing to send
his stuffed fillet of beef,

35:39.712 --> 35:41.742
and Gordon is not happy.

35:41.742 --> 35:43.592
Hey, come on.
Please, yeah?

35:43.592 --> 35:44.582
-Yes, yes.
-Yeah, I know.

35:44.582 --> 35:45.622
No, but I can see
it on your face,

35:45.622 --> 35:48.532
but I am not going to start
here and let you send.

35:48.532 --> 35:48.871
Not tonight.

35:48.871 --> 35:49.712
No way.

35:49.712 --> 35:50.742
I'm getting frustrated.

35:50.742 --> 35:52.682
Oh, come on.

35:52.682 --> 35:56.602
Mister big chef shouldn't
be in the kitchen.

35:56.602 --> 35:58.652
The guy's not a chef.

35:58.652 --> 36:00.762
With the restaurant
on the verge of success,

36:00.762 --> 36:04.692
chef Michel is insisting on
reverting back to his old ways,

36:04.692 --> 36:06.792
and Gordon has reached
his breaking point.

36:06.792 --> 36:07.752
-Thank you very much.
-OK.

36:07.752 --> 36:08.256
I think it's great.

36:08.256 --> 36:08.692
I think it's great.

36:09.632 --> 36:10.702
You don't care anymore, do you?

36:10.702 --> 36:11.822
Get straight to
the  answer.

36:11.822 --> 36:13.742
No, I'm not cutting no.
I'm telling you how--

36:13.742 --> 36:15.532
Get straight to
the  answer.

36:15.532 --> 36:15.911
-OK, all right.
-OK.

36:15.911 --> 36:16.772
All right, good.

36:16.772 --> 36:18.622
Your menu is not
better than mine.

36:18.622 --> 36:18.966
You know?

36:18.966 --> 36:19.642
You're a donkey.

36:22.632 --> 36:23.692
- What?
- Yeah.

36:23.692 --> 36:24.552
This is--
-No, hold on.

36:24.552 --> 36:24.887
No, hold on.
Hold on.

36:24.887 --> 36:25.241
Hold on.
Hold on.

36:25.241 --> 36:25.812
Let me finish.
-Don't point your finger.

36:25.812 --> 36:27.552
-Let me finish.
-Don't push the finger.

36:27.552 --> 36:28.612
You put your
hands up here.

36:28.612 --> 36:29.652
Listen to me.

36:29.652 --> 36:31.622
You run a  hole of a
kitchen.  yourself.

36:31.622 --> 36:32.582
-No.
-OK?

36:32.582 --> 36:32.934
No.
No.

36:32.934 --> 36:33.742
No.

36:34.742 --> 36:36.652
Who the  are you
to turn around and tell

36:36.652 --> 36:37.722
me when you work like a pig?

36:37.722 --> 36:38.256
Yeah.

36:38.256 --> 36:38.662
Yeah.

36:38.662 --> 36:39.762
You,  pig.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.582
Yeah, you know what?

36:41.582 --> 36:41.921
You have big words.

36:41.921 --> 36:42.692
You're so
full of.

36:42.692 --> 36:43.802
Open your eyes and
have a look around.

36:43.802 --> 36:44.822
Big mouth.
Big.

36:44.822 --> 36:45.772
Mouth.

36:45.772 --> 36:46.712
You're not happy?

36:46.712 --> 36:47.722
I'm  happy.

36:47.722 --> 36:48.812
-You can get out.
-Go on.

36:48.812 --> 36:49.752
You can get out.

36:49.752 --> 36:50.702
yourself.

36:50.702 --> 36:51.642
You can get out.

36:51.642 --> 36:52.812
- It's my  kitchen.
- Yeah, is it?

36:52.812 --> 36:54.722
Well, if it's your
kitchen, then clean it,

36:54.722 --> 36:55.762
you lazy.

36:55.762 --> 36:56.702
No!

37:06.632 --> 37:08.752
It's relaunch
night at The Secret Garden,

37:08.752 --> 37:12.692
and chef Michel is insisting on
reverting back to his old ways,

37:12.692 --> 37:14.652
and Gordon has reached
his breaking point.

37:14.652 --> 37:15.772
You don't
care anymore, do you?

37:15.772 --> 37:17.622
Get straight to
the  answer.

37:17.622 --> 37:18.652
No, I'm not cutting no.

37:18.652 --> 37:19.592
I'm telling you--

37:19.592 --> 37:20.672
Get straight to
the  answer.

37:20.672 --> 37:21.552
-OK, all right?
-OK.

37:21.552 --> 37:22.572
All right.
Good.

37:22.572 --> 37:23.692
Your menu is not
better than mine.

37:23.692 --> 37:24.822
You run a
hole of a kitchen.

37:24.822 --> 37:25.762
OK.

37:25.762 --> 37:26.712
You  pig.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.812
- You can get out.
- Go on.

37:27.812 --> 37:28.752
You can get out.

37:28.752 --> 37:29.692
Go  yourself.

37:29.692 --> 37:30.682
You can get out.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.419
It's my  kitchen.

37:31.419 --> 37:31.692
It's my  kitchen.

37:31.692 --> 37:32.632
Yeah, is it?

37:32.632 --> 37:33.652
Well if it's your
kitchen, then clean it,

37:33.652 --> 37:34.682
you lazy.

37:34.682 --> 37:36.632
No!

37:36.632 --> 37:37.742
I've got to
get some air before I

37:37.742 --> 37:39.552
do something I really regret.

37:43.612 --> 37:47.582
The way Ramsay did this
incredible diatribe on Michel,

37:47.582 --> 37:51.692
and he was just blown
away, flabbergasted.

37:51.692 --> 37:53.592
An extraordinary
day to day, but I've

37:53.592 --> 37:55.782
never seen anything quite
as shocking as that,

37:55.782 --> 37:58.552
and that guy clearly doesn't
care about his customers,

37:58.552 --> 37:59.642
his food, or his dining room.

37:59.642 --> 38:01.419
He just cares about himself--
one selfish.

38:01.419 --> 38:04.552
He just cares about himself--
one selfish.

38:04.552 --> 38:06.592
Where's the train station?

38:06.592 --> 38:08.652
I seriously thought
about walking away,

38:08.652 --> 38:10.742
but there were other
people relying on me.

38:10.742 --> 38:14.602
I had to finish the job.

38:14.602 --> 38:15.722
After
cooling off, Gordon

38:15.722 --> 38:18.602
decides to return to
prevent the old menu

38:18.602 --> 38:20.672
dish from leaving the kitchen.

38:20.672 --> 38:21.672
-Chef to chef?
-Yes.

38:21.672 --> 38:22.612
Hey.

38:27.662 --> 38:29.662
I agree.

38:29.662 --> 38:30.662
Yes.

38:30.662 --> 38:31.419
Every table is
a VIP table, yes?

38:31.419 --> 38:31.802
Every table is
a VIP table, yes?

38:31.802 --> 38:33.622
Yes.

38:33.622 --> 38:35.712
Jane, can we get
rid of that food,

38:35.712 --> 38:37.762
please, finally, yeah,
for the fifth time?

38:37.762 --> 38:39.732
Good.

38:39.732 --> 38:41.752
Michel, please don't panic.

38:41.752 --> 38:42.692
No, everyone's--

38:42.692 --> 38:43.632
Jane?

38:43.632 --> 38:44.762
No one is panicking, yes?
-No.

38:44.762 --> 38:45.702
Yeah?

38:45.702 --> 38:46.772
Please keep it together.
-All right.

38:46.772 --> 38:47.712
Up, up, and away.

38:47.712 --> 38:48.812
Let's go, yeah?

38:48.812 --> 38:50.652
That's
for the VIP table.

38:50.652 --> 38:53.802
That's for the
food critic's table.

38:53.802 --> 38:56.732
Finally, the food
critic was given a proper dish

38:56.732 --> 38:57.722
from the new menu.

39:05.592 --> 39:06.532
Oh.

39:09.652 --> 39:10.592
Thank you.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.722
Even though the food
critic was happy with the dish

39:15.722 --> 39:18.782
from the new menu, Michel
was still not convinced.

39:18.782 --> 39:20.732
You going to go out
there and see them.

39:20.732 --> 39:22.712
I'm going to go to every table.

39:22.712 --> 39:24.762
When I go to the customers,
they're my real critics.

39:29.652 --> 39:31.419
Oh, it's fantastic.

39:31.419 --> 39:31.602
Oh, it's fantastic.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.642
And the salmon was
the best I've ever had.

39:33.642 --> 39:35.612
Really?

39:35.612 --> 39:36.662
-Yes.
-Excellent.

39:36.662 --> 39:37.702
Thank you.

39:37.702 --> 39:39.642
How do you like
the new dining room?

39:39.642 --> 39:40.592
It's beautiful.

39:40.592 --> 39:42.632
When I asked the customers,
they say they love it.

39:42.632 --> 39:43.742
The food was exquisite.

39:43.742 --> 39:46.682
It was delicious.

39:46.682 --> 39:48.722
Now, I'm wondering
what I do wrong.

39:48.722 --> 39:50.802
How was the people
when they left?

39:50.802 --> 39:52.642
Everyone loved it.
Everyone--

39:52.642 --> 39:53.582
Yes?

39:53.582 --> 39:54.562
Not an angry face.

39:54.562 --> 39:54.901
OK.

39:54.901 --> 39:55.742
It was really good.

39:55.742 --> 39:57.602
But I want to make
sure that not angry

39:57.602 --> 39:58.572
doesn't mean they loved it.

39:58.572 --> 39:59.632
I want to make
sure that they left

39:59.632 --> 40:00.682
and they said
everything was great.

40:04.762 --> 40:07.602
But if Michel needed
a little more convincing,

40:07.602 --> 40:09.742
the answer was in
the cash register.

40:09.742 --> 40:12.752
You know, for 60 customers,
we did $50 per person,

40:12.752 --> 40:15.552
so we've done a bit more
than $3,000 of revenue.

40:15.552 --> 40:16.582
This is great.

40:16.582 --> 40:19.782
It was great to
have the business.

40:19.782 --> 40:21.802
After an
evening of ups and downs,

40:21.802 --> 40:24.672
the relaunch was a
success, but there is still

40:24.672 --> 40:26.692
one question left unanswered.

40:26.692 --> 40:29.572
Did Gordon truly get
through to Michel?

40:29.572 --> 40:31.419
It is difficult
to do changes.

40:31.419 --> 40:31.552
It is difficult
to do changes.

40:31.552 --> 40:33.642
Maybe not for
everybody, but for me.

40:33.642 --> 40:35.822
I'm so wrong.

40:35.822 --> 40:37.582
-Are you just saying that?
-No, no.

40:37.582 --> 40:38.712
I mean it.
I mean it.

40:38.712 --> 40:40.802
The customers loved the changes.

40:40.802 --> 40:42.762
I liked the way
the food came out.

40:42.762 --> 40:45.692
It was clean, and
we made a profit.

40:45.692 --> 40:46.712
I think it's exciting.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.652
I know how stubborn you are.

40:48.652 --> 40:49.592
Yes.

40:49.592 --> 40:50.732
And it's not the
first time in my career

40:50.732 --> 40:52.592
I've come across someone
as stubborn as you.

40:52.592 --> 40:57.592
However, tonight was much
better than the other nights.

40:57.592 --> 40:59.732
You put you first
foot on the ladder.

40:59.732 --> 41:01.419
Now, you gotta keep on climbing.

41:01.419 --> 41:01.642
Now, you gotta keep on climbing.

41:01.642 --> 41:02.582
Yes.

41:02.582 --> 41:04.582
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

41:04.582 --> 41:05.562
Well done.

41:05.562 --> 41:08.582
Now that you know, don't stop.

41:08.582 --> 41:10.642
I won't.

41:10.642 --> 41:12.692
With Gordon's
help, The Secret Garden

41:12.692 --> 41:14.692
was functioning as
a restaurant should,

41:14.692 --> 41:16.662
and as the week
progressed, changes

41:16.662 --> 41:17.802
clearly began to take hold.

41:17.802 --> 41:20.802
If we all spend half
an hour cleaning,

41:20.802 --> 41:23.592
this kitchen becomes spotless.

41:23.592 --> 41:26.562
Michel is
committed to kitchen hygiene.

41:26.562 --> 41:28.582
He also promoted
Jane to manager.

41:28.582 --> 41:29.822
I think she needs the
keys to the restaurant

41:29.822 --> 41:30.762
with the manager title.

41:30.762 --> 41:31.419
Congratulations.

41:31.419 --> 41:31.742
Congratulations.

41:34.762 --> 41:37.612
Now I'm the manager, I am
in the bitch of the place.

41:37.612 --> 41:39.612
Gordon's
plan was a success,

41:39.612 --> 41:42.742
and now The Secret Garden is
no longer a kitchen nightmare

41:42.742 --> 41:45.702
and more importantly,
customers are leaving happy.

41:45.702 --> 41:46.732
I'm feeling the love.

41:46.732 --> 41:47.672
Cheers.

41:47.672 --> 41:48.612
Cheers.

41:50.782 --> 41:52.682
You really do have
something special.

41:52.682 --> 41:55.722
Please, do not screw it up.

41:55.722 --> 41:58.612
The restaurant has
improved immensely.

41:58.612 --> 41:59.612
Ramsay succeeded.

41:59.612 --> 42:00.572
Dude.

42:00.572 --> 42:01.419
Thank you, chef.

42:01.419 --> 42:01.532
Thank you, chef.

42:01.532 --> 42:02.792
Manager.

42:02.792 --> 42:06.712
If we can't be successful
now, then we're all idiots.

42:06.712 --> 42:07.652
All right, darling.

42:07.652 --> 42:08.682
Thank you so much.

42:08.682 --> 42:09.622
Well done.

42:09.622 --> 42:11.652
It was very sad to
see Gordon leave.

42:11.652 --> 42:12.802
He's really helped us.

42:12.802 --> 42:15.742
I think we are at the
beginning of a very,

42:15.742 --> 42:17.562
very successful year.

42:17.562 --> 42:18.642
-No regrets.
-Thank you.

42:18.642 --> 42:18.980
No regrets.
-Promise?

42:18.980 --> 42:19.722
Promise.

42:19.722 --> 42:21.712
Still hate me?

42:21.712 --> 42:23.542
Yes, good.

42:23.542 --> 42:24.822
It was a very
stressful few days,

42:24.822 --> 42:27.552
but I think we all survived.

42:27.552 --> 42:28.762
I think it's all for the better.

42:28.762 --> 42:31.419
The secret is out.

42:31.419 --> 42:32.582
The secret is out.

42:32.582 --> 42:34.532
Michel finally
learned the cardinal rule

42:34.532 --> 42:35.702
of being a restaurateur.

42:35.702 --> 42:39.602
You serve your
customers, not yourself.
