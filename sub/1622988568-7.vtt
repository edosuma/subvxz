14:13.686 --> 14:15.229
To give you that rush too.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.316
I'd rather have you than the rush.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.820
And I would rather have it all.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.948
And I think you would too.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.577
So what...?

14:31.161 --> 14:32.079
What do we do?

14:34.790 --> 14:35.624
I don't know.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.502
[Trina] Hello! Anyone home?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.380
Oh, shit. I invited them over
to celebrate.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.632
-The promotion you didn't know about?
-Yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.468
-Hi!
-Congratulations, Cooper.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.846
-Thank you.
-We brought bubbly.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.431
Put her there, partner.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.724
Thanks, buddy.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.310
And Trina made her famous seven-layer dip,

14:54.393 --> 14:56.896
and there are a lot of things
that I love about this woman,

14:56.979 --> 14:59.440
but this dip is why I put a ring on it.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.775
This is it.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.860
[Trina] Aww.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.361
Stop.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.240
[kids laughing]

15:10.701 --> 15:12.036
So?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.330
How are you doing?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.542
And, uh, how is it going with the sexy ex?

15:19.460 --> 15:23.130
When you called me looking for Cooper,
you sounded so distraught, I wondered if--

15:23.213 --> 15:26.050
Um, no, that was a misunderstanding.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.509
And the, um...

15:28.928 --> 15:32.097
stuff with the ex is, um, ancient history.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.974
And Cooper and I...

15:35.017 --> 15:36.894
are really focused on each other now.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.437
[speaking indistinctly]

15:43.943 --> 15:46.862
Yeah. You guys look deliriously happy.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.076
Listen, what...

15:53.577 --> 15:56.205
exactly did you mean
the other day about, um...

15:57.373 --> 16:00.084
you know, marriages falling into a rut

16:00.167 --> 16:06.090
and needing to spice things up,
but then doing it together?

16:06.173 --> 16:07.216
Oh, girl.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.972
Do you really think you're ready for this?

16:14.014 --> 16:17.434
At this point, I think we're ready
for just about anything.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.940
-Can you get a sitter for tonight?
-I could call Sasha.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.276
'Cause Devon and I are gonna
blow your mind.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.029

16:31.657 --> 16:33.659

16:43.419 --> 16:45.963
Oh, I know. Been dying to work with you

16:46.046 --> 16:48.632
ever since I heard what you did
on Willow McKenna's album.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.718
She said the whole experience was...

16:51.343 --> 16:52.636
transformative.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.639
You're friends.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.559
Well, friendly enough that she warned me
not to sleep with you.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.103
-Yeah, that was a long time ago.
-Not what I heard.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.023
-Let's get to work, okay?
-Yeah.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.649
Let's do it.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.653

Um, this is Brad.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.792
Brad, these are my parents. Vivi--

18:04.875 --> 18:07.377
You can just call us "Mom" and "Dad."

18:08.545 --> 18:11.924
Oh, I am so happy to finally meet you.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.346
Daddy and I were so sorry
to hear about the baby.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.183
But, please, don't let this keep you
from trying again.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.268
-Mom.
-You know Melanie Bennett.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.980
She had three miscarriages
until she got little Jasper.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.817
And just look at that sweet boy.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.443
He's delicious, huh?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.654
Yeah, he really is.

18:33.737 --> 18:37.783
Don't mind your mother.
You know how she gets ahead of herself.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.160
Well, I just don't want you
to give up is all.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.162
And, well, although--

18:42.246 --> 18:44.623
This will be the last time I'll say it,

18:44.706 --> 18:48.001
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world to get married first.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.419
Mom, enough.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.756
The ceremony's about to start.
Uh, we should go get seats.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.967
So glad you came, honey.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.468
Yeah, me too.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.558
I'm so sorry.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.936
Can we just erase the last five minutes?

19:06.019 --> 19:08.981

I am so done with you.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.048
Billie, wait.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.842
No. You've been freaking out
ever since we lost the baby,

20:18.926 --> 20:22.095
which makes no sense because
you never wanted it in the first place.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.972
-That's not true!
-You said so!

20:24.056 --> 20:27.601
Okay, maybe it was true at the start,
but then I was all in. Hey!

20:28.143 --> 20:30.854
You don't even know how all-in I was.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.483
If your idea of all-in is making out
with some random chick

20:34.566 --> 20:36.693
at my cousin's wedding, I don't need it.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.446
Oh, we're going through
some dark shit right now, okay?

20:39.529 --> 20:41.281
-I've had too much to drink.
-Bullshit!

20:41.365 --> 20:43.575
You knew exactly what you were doing.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.286
You wanted me to catch you,
so you could walk out on me

20:46.370 --> 20:48.413
the same way
that your dad walked out on you.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.416
This is what you do, Brad.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.336
You said so yourself,
and for far too long now,

20:54.419 --> 20:56.129
it is what I have let you do.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.260
I'm not gonna let you anymore.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.765
Billie, please--

21:09.184 --> 21:11.270
It's my fault we lost the baby.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.028
What are you talking about?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.908
I'm not worthy of being a father.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.330
Even the fucking universe agrees.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.959
Is that what you think?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.923
I don't wanna lose you, B.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.098
I'm just--

21:49.474 --> 21:51.643
I'm so fucked up right now.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.814
You know what?

22:00.068 --> 22:01.653
I actually believe you.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.865
That's what's so frustrating.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.911
Sasha thinks I'm crazy for hanging in,
thinking that you'll...

22:10.620 --> 22:13.623
ever get past what happened with your dad.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.626
But...

22:17.252 --> 22:18.795
I know who you really are.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.757
Who you wanna be.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.554
You just get scared, and then you act out

22:27.637 --> 22:32.017
in these incredibly hurtful ways
to avoid dealing with those feelings,

22:32.100 --> 22:33.810
but you have to, Brad.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.939
You have to face them and your father.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.861
I can't be with you unless you do.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.367
I did find him.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.788
When I thought I was gonna be a dad.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.793
[groans] I thought
it might bring us closer together.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.757
He lives in Wyoming now.
