STEVE: Meet Ben Pollard,
long-time resident

03:43.527 --> 03:45.007
of Kaneohe
Psychiatric Hospital.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.662
His body was found
in the bottom of a ravine

03:47.705 --> 03:49.316
about a mile away
from the facility.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.275
Now, the staff reported this
as an accident,

03:52.319 --> 03:54.756
but according to Noelani,
Mr. Pollard suffered

03:54.799 --> 03:57.541
a depressed skull fracture
prior to the fall.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.586
Someone cracked him on the skull

03:58.629 --> 03:59.848
and threw his body
in the ravine.

03:59.891 --> 04:00.936
Yeah.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.459
Do the folks
at Kaneohe have any idea

04:02.503 --> 04:04.069
what this guy was doing
outside the hospital?

04:04.113 --> 04:05.201
No. They're
suggesting that he

04:05.245 --> 04:06.724
must have taken off
on his own.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.726
I assume we're not buying that.Well, I'm not buying it,

04:08.770 --> 04:10.032
and I'll tell you why.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.339
Mr. Pollard has
been a resident at the hospital

04:12.382 --> 04:15.298
for over eight years,
and never once has this man

04:15.342 --> 04:16.604
even tried to leave the grounds.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.909
Right, what are we
thinking, then?

04:17.953 --> 04:19.520
Something happened
within the hospital,

04:19.563 --> 04:21.348
he leaves, and then he's
followed out by somebody?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.437
Right now, that seems to be
the most likely scenario.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.266
Trouble is, the staff has really
circled the wagons on this one.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.051
HPD went in, did a bunch
of interviews, got nowhere.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.445
Sounds like we need somebody
on the inside.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.447
That's right, Junior, it does.
And lucky for us,

04:33.490 --> 04:35.449
Kaneohe happens to have
an opening for an orderly

04:35.492 --> 04:37.277
at the moment.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.539
Eric is gonna
doctor up a résumé,

04:38.582 --> 04:39.670
which means
it shouldn't be too hard

04:39.714 --> 04:40.758
to put one of you guys under.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.369
Well, do you think
this is gonna be

04:42.412 --> 04:43.674
a long-term
assignment, sir?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.241
I don't know. Maybe.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.721
Okay.

04:46.764 --> 04:50.202
Well, I-I think this is
totally in Tani's wheelhouse.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.553
Oh.I'm sorry, what

04:52.596 --> 04:54.729
Uh, you know,
the-the purpose of an orderly

04:54.772 --> 04:56.383
is to maintain order, and, uh,

04:56.426 --> 04:57.949
that's kind of, like,
lifeguard adjacent.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.951
That's a good point.TANIA: Oh, yeah,
that's a great point.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.039
You see what
he's doing here, right?

05:01.083 --> 05:02.040
Making a good point?

05:02.084 --> 05:03.607
No. He-he's... he's worried

05:03.651 --> 05:05.087
that he's gonna get stuck
working

05:05.130 --> 05:06.915
a long-term undercover op,
and he's trying to justify

05:06.958 --> 05:08.830
why I'm the one
who's supposed to do it.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.745
That's not true.That is true.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.224
You know what else is true

05:12.268 --> 05:14.749
The job of an orderly
is traditionally a man's job.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.054
Whoa.
Whoa.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.229
Now, I don't think jobs
should be gender-biased.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.101
No?But that's the world we live in.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.755
In which case,
I think Junior's right for it.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.018
Okay. How about this?
I don't care what you guys do--

05:23.061 --> 05:25.194
flip a coin, Rochambeau,
have a... have an arm-wrestle--

05:25.237 --> 05:26.848
but one of you is going under.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.676
I'll do it.
What's that?

05:28.719 --> 05:30.939
I said I'll do it.
What? I can do this.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.941
I got a badge, too, you know?

05:32.984 --> 05:34.246
Yeah, you don't have
to convince us.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.248
You really
want this, Jerry?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.601
All right, it's yours.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.254
Really?
Yeah.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.300
Thanks, buddy.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.520
You put your faith
in me, Commander.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.608
I'm not gonna
let you down.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.306
I know you're not.
I know that.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
All right, so where are we at?
What's going on?

05:52.395 --> 05:54.354
Have you searched
the victim's room yet?

05:54.397 --> 05:55.964
I thought HPD already did that.

05:56.007 --> 05:59.141
They did, but that doesn't mean
there's nothing there.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.317
Jerry, a good cop
stays awake at night

06:01.361 --> 06:02.666
thinking
that they missed something.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.755
You know, they lose sleep
over that kind of stuff.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.322
And sometimes they're right.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.325
The thing is, they got me
assigned to a different wing.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.632
If I start showing up,
it may, you know,

06:11.675 --> 06:12.633
raise some questions.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.199
Jerry, look, I know you've only

06:14.243 --> 06:16.637
been under a short while,
and your instincts are correct.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.465
Okay, you don't want to
get made, but here's the thing.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.814
The more time that passes,

06:19.857 --> 06:22.164
the less chance we have
of solving this thing.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.601
I mean, people's
recollections get hazy.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.950
Any physical evidence
that's out there,

06:25.994 --> 06:27.822
it's already degrading.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.606
Gotcha. We're on a clock here.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.260
We are.
We're on a clock, okay?

06:31.303 --> 06:33.262
And, Jerry, right now
we got nothing.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.698
I mean, we got no leads.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.831
We don't even know
what this thing's about.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.442
Okay? We need intel,
and it's your job to get it.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.009
So be resourceful.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.924
In other words, I gotta
start thinking like you.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.187
Well, I mean, if Danny were
here, he'd say absolutely not,

06:45.230 --> 06:46.667
but yeah, basically,
that's what I'm saying.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.277
Think like me a little bit.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.237
Use that Ortega charm
that you have in spades, huh?

06:52.281 --> 06:54.849
If you can't find
a staff member to talk to,

06:54.892 --> 06:56.894
find a patient.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.896
All right?
Call me if you need me.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.516
He'll be right out.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.908
Thank you.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.393
Hi. Hi.
Hey, sis.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.003
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.222
Thanks.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.745
I feel good.
Yeah?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.530
Better than I have
in a long time.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.966
All right, let's go.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.271
Where are your bags?

07:26.315 --> 07:27.534
Yeah, about that.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.274
Um...

07:29.318 --> 07:31.407
I'm not leaving.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.495
What's going on?

07:32.539 --> 07:34.149
I thought you were done.No, I am,

07:34.192 --> 07:36.717
but they sort of
offered me a job here.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.022
I'd be working
as a counselor,

07:38.066 --> 07:39.154
doing some
other stuff.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.678
They think I'd be
really good at it.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.854
I'm sorry I made you drive
all the way out here,

07:43.898 --> 07:46.248
but it's been so long--
I kind of wanted to see you.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.076
It's fine.
Sorry, I'm just, like...

07:48.119 --> 07:49.904
I'm just really thrown by that.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.994
That's... that's really good.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.343
That's really good.

07:54.386 --> 07:57.346
Yeah. It's a chance to
help people, you know?

07:57.389 --> 08:00.523
Sometimes just having
someone who believes in you,

08:00.567 --> 08:03.091
it's what gets you
to the other side.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.051
I know that made the
difference for me.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.231
Okay, are you trying to make me
cry here? This is like...

08:13.275 --> 08:15.712
Well, hey, at least this time,
it's for a good reason, right?

08:17.714 --> 08:18.889
Come here.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.587
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.762
Thank you.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.851
I'm so proud of you.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.113
Really.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.549
And, you know,
if Daddy were here,

08:26.593 --> 08:27.985
he'd be proud of you, too.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.082
Howzit, Frank?

08:38.126 --> 08:40.302
Uh, still kind of bummed about
that softball game yesterday.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.565
I mean, it's bad enough
we give up 13 runs,

08:42.609 --> 08:44.654
but did it have
to be to the HFD?

08:44.698 --> 08:45.786
It's pathetic.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.744
We need Iosa back
in that lineup.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.051
Otherwise, it'll be
the same thing next week.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.096
You ask me, our hitting
is not the problem.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.272
Our guys can't
field for crap.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.970
Can't make that many errors
and still...

09:12.029 --> 09:13.901
Hey.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.380
What's up? Any luck
tracking him down?

09:15.424 --> 09:16.860
What's going on?Uh, no, not yet.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.819
Uh, Tani's trying to ping
Sergeant Lukela's phone,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.560
but it looks like
he turned it off.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.952
Man, this is odd.
Does anybody have

09:21.996 --> 09:23.171
any idea what the hell

09:23.214 --> 09:24.520
this was really about?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.218
No, but, uh, Sergeant Bellina
says that one minute

09:27.262 --> 09:29.786
him and Sergeant Lukela
are making small talk...

09:29.830 --> 09:32.223
50,000 volts later,
he's waking up on the floor.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.617
Says that Sergeant Lukela
walks in and asks to pull

09:34.661 --> 09:37.098
an evidence box
from an open murder case.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.579
We checked that box. It doesn't
look like it's been touched.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.364
Okay, well, he was obviously
doing something here.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.105
Let's check all the other
boxes. Let's dust them all

09:44.148 --> 09:45.410
for his fingerprints.
We got security footage.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.326
Pull it up, see what aisle
he was going down.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.372
On another note, let's have CSU
focus on any cases

09:50.415 --> 09:51.765
that Duke's been working on,
all right?

09:51.808 --> 09:53.331
Anybody reach out
to Duke's family?

09:53.375 --> 09:54.637
Well, Tani's doing that
right now.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.638
All right.
That's good.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.770
Maybe they know something.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.206
GROVER: Yeah, well,
let's hope so,

09:58.249 --> 09:59.294
'cause this is nuts.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.904
Duke is as straight
as they come.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.515
This is a guy that would rather
read a mosquito its rights

10:03.559 --> 10:05.648
instead of swatting it.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.954
It just ain't him.

10:06.997 --> 10:07.955
So, why'd he do it?

10:07.998 --> 10:10.174
Hell, Junior, I don't know.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.959
So we have to follow
every option,

10:12.002 --> 10:13.395
no matter how crazy it sounds.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.439
Yeah.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.025
Help you?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.287
Hey. I'm new here.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.028
Hector Gomez.Mila.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.639
What can I do for you,
Hector Gomez?

10:39.682 --> 10:43.164
Uh, administration wants
Ben Pollard's room packed up.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.470
So, um, I'll come back and
pick these up in an hour?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.213
Is there a problem?

10:49.257 --> 10:51.476
Mm, it's just that
I'm kind of on my lunch break.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.391
Could you maybe
come back a little later?I don't know.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.002
They said
they wanted it done ASAP.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.745
Tell you what--
I'll cut you a deal.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.703
I'll box up the stuff for you.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.837
And what do you want in return?

11:15.457 --> 11:17.459
♪

11:33.518 --> 11:36.304
♪

11:46.140 --> 11:47.924
Hey, is there anyone

11:47.968 --> 11:49.621
that Ben used to
play chess with?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.754
Figured they might want
this clock as a memento.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.408
Oh, that's sweet.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.758
Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact,
a patient named Harris Stubman.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.673
He and Ben used to play
together every day.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.762
Harris Stubman.
You know where I can find him?

11:59.806 --> 12:01.764
Uh, yeah. His room
is down the hall, 5B.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.026
But he's got group now.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.289
He won't be out
for another 40 minutes.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.943
Cool. Thanks.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.641
Oh, and tell your mom I want
that chicken salad recipe.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.165
Okay.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.821
DANNY: All right,
all right, all right. Thanks.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.953
Hey, yo. Grover just
looped me in on Duke.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.346
What's going on?
What's the latest?Okay, listen.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.913
So HPD's sitting
on his house right now.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.479
He has not been home.
Looks that way.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.916
His car is still
in the driveway.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.787
They checked his financials--
no hits, no nothing.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
This isn't Duke. I mean,
none of this makes any sense.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.443
By the way, if Duke doesn't
want us to find him,

12:28.486 --> 12:29.879
we ain't gonna find him.
You know that, right?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.141
No, I know.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.578
Guys, I think I have something.

12:33.622 --> 12:36.494
So I contacted Duke's wife
and daughter this morning.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.714
They both claimed that
they hadn't spoken to him.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.889
What do you mean, "claimed"?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.325
You have reason
to believe they're lying?

12:41.369 --> 12:43.632
Well, I do, after I checked
their phone records.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.416
Look at this.
Looks like his daughter

12:45.460 --> 12:46.809
placed a call to HPD
this morning--

12:46.853 --> 12:48.332
Duke's direct line--

12:48.376 --> 12:50.204
and the call lasted
for over two minutes.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.163
Why would she lie to you?

12:54.469 --> 12:56.819
So, how can I help?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.778
Well, for starters,
you have any idea

12:58.821 --> 13:00.649
why your father would do
something like this?

13:00.692 --> 13:02.782
I'm sorry. No.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.653
TANI: Have you noticed
any unusual behavior?

13:05.915 --> 13:07.264
Anything he might
have done or said?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.613
A phone call he
might have received?

13:08.657 --> 13:09.614
Anything?
No.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.008
This thing...

13:12.052 --> 13:14.054
it was totally
out of the blue.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.099
Uh, when was the last time
you spoke to your dad?

13:17.535 --> 13:20.582
Uh, it was a couple of days ago.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.975
I've been so busy.STEVE: Mmm.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.849
Carrie, we know that you spoke
to him this morning.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.417
No, that's...

13:29.460 --> 13:30.722
I'm sorry, you're...
you're mistaken.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.376
TANI: Carrie, we pulled
your phone records.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.292
We know that you spoke
to him before 9:00.

13:35.336 --> 13:38.861
Then you spoke again
at 9:08 and 9:21.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.648
I really don't want
to say anything else.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.520
Look at me, please.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.217
I've known you
and your father for years.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.828
Okay? He's a good man.
I know that,

13:48.871 --> 13:50.177
for a fact, he would never

13:50.220 --> 13:51.874
do something like this
unless he had a good reason.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.093
Whatever this is,

13:53.136 --> 13:55.008
whatever's going on
with you, with him,

13:55.051 --> 13:56.487
we want to help you,

13:56.531 --> 13:58.750
but you have got to tell us
what you know.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.491
Carrie, you know me.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.276
You can trust me.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.932
It's Akela.
Your daughter?

14:06.367 --> 14:07.629
STEVE:
What about her?

14:07.672 --> 14:09.587
They took her.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.980
Coming.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.639
What are you doing?!

14:21.121 --> 14:22.949
Akela, no!

14:22.992 --> 14:24.124
Mommy!

14:24.167 --> 14:25.473
Let her go!

14:26.822 --> 14:28.171
Who

14:28.215 --> 14:29.390
Carrie, who took her?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.870
I don't know. I don't know.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.220
But they told my dad,
if he got anyone else involved,

14:33.263 --> 14:34.612
that they would kill her.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.056
CARRIE:
I called my dad right away.

14:43.099 --> 14:44.840
And then, by the time
I got him on the phone,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.146
they had already contacted him.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.277
And they warned him

14:47.321 --> 14:48.713
not to get anyone else involved

14:48.757 --> 14:50.280
and that he would get
instructions soon.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.978
STEVE:
Okay. Have any idea

14:52.021 --> 14:53.240
how they contacted him?

14:53.283 --> 14:55.198
Um, he got a package at work.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.026
There was a cell phone inside.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.160
And... my dad told me
not to say anything.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.249
And then he came straight
to my house after that.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.904
And when he got there,
that's when they called.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.602
LUKELA:
What do you want?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.822
A key?

15:10.866 --> 15:12.912
What... what key?

15:12.955 --> 15:15.349
And they didn't ask
for a ransom?

15:15.392 --> 15:16.654
No, they just wanted some key.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.396
I understand.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.137
I'll get it for you. Just...

15:21.181 --> 15:23.096
don't hurt her, please.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.358
Please.

15:25.750 --> 15:30.712
Honey... honey, I need you
to do something for me.

15:32.061 --> 15:35.195
My dad told me that I needed
to stay at home,

15:35.238 --> 15:36.936
and if anyone showed up
asking questions,

15:36.979 --> 15:40.113
I was just supposed
to act like everything was okay.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.550
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.638
Forget about that, please.

15:43.681 --> 15:44.639
You were doing

15:44.682 --> 15:46.075
what your father
asked you to do.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.642
GROVER:
Okay, Carrie.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.992
Before Duke left,
did he mention anything

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
about what kind
of key they wanted

15:52.038 --> 15:53.517
or what they wanted it for?

15:53.561 --> 15:54.866
No.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.868
Just that he was gonna do
whatever they asked.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.348
TANI:
Have you heard
from your dad

15:58.392 --> 15:59.523
since he left your house?

15:59.567 --> 16:00.829
No.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.483
DANNY: Carrie, if your
dad calls you, you gotta

16:02.526 --> 16:04.702
tell him to call one of us.
We can help him.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.009
He doesn't have to
do this by himself.STEVE: Danny's right, okay?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.793
You guys are ohana.
We look out for each other.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.492
I need you to go home.
There's gonna be a couple

16:11.535 --> 16:12.972
of plain-clothed officers
waiting for you

16:13.015 --> 16:14.190
and somebody from CSU.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.626
We need to process your house,

16:15.670 --> 16:17.759
but we need to do it discreetly
in case the kidnappers

16:17.802 --> 16:19.369
are still watching,
so they're gonna come in

16:19.413 --> 16:21.154
through the back door.
Don't be spooked.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.198
Okay.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.460
Hey, listen to me.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.027
We're gonna do
everything we can

16:25.071 --> 16:26.376
to get Akela
back safe, okay?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.030
Hey, I promise.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.205
Thank you.
Okay.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.554
All of you.

16:30.598 --> 16:31.816
Yeah.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.035
Come on, I'll walk you out.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.341
Lou.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.560
Grab Tani. Go on down
to the HPD evidence room.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.519
I want you to go through
every case-- see if any of them

16:38.562 --> 16:40.042
have a key logged in
as a piece of evidence.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.609
Danny, do me a favor.
Call HPD.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.480
Tell them to stand down.
Duke is no longer

16:43.524 --> 16:45.047
a person of interest.
He's not to be touched.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.527
From this moment on,
this is a Five-O matter.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.834
I always knew Duke
meant a lot to you guys,

16:49.878 --> 16:52.098
but after what he did,

16:52.141 --> 16:54.056
for McGarrett
to stick by him...

16:54.100 --> 16:55.753
That's McGarrett.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.451
That's just who he is.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.540
He's a guy that'll never
turn his back on family,

16:59.583 --> 17:00.802
no matter what.

17:08.244 --> 17:11.769
I mean, you can understand
something like that, right?

17:11.813 --> 17:13.989
Yeah, I think I can.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
Harris. Hey there. I'm...

17:23.129 --> 17:24.608
It's, uh, not 3:00.

17:24.652 --> 17:25.783
Excuse me?

17:25.827 --> 17:27.959
I usually get my meds at 3:00.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.265
Mmm.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.093
One, two, three, four.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.964
Well, I'm new here.
I thought I'd introduce myself.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.444
I'm Hector Gomez.
Mmm.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.276
Mmm, mmm.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.496
Mmm. One, two,
three, four.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.975
One, two, three, four.Can I come in?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.064
I hear you like chess.

17:48.676 --> 17:51.461
Mmm. That's Ben's clock.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.333
Do you know him? Mmm.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.249
No, but I heard you guys used to
play, so I figured you might...

17:56.292 --> 17:58.251
When is Ben coming back?

17:58.294 --> 18:00.949
Um, I'm not sure if he is.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.476
I'm sorry.
Should we play?

18:07.999 --> 18:10.785
Is 20 minutes okay?

18:12.178 --> 18:14.223
One, two, three, four.All right.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.747
Don't hold back.
I'm pretty good.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.315
I don't mean to brag,
but I was Kukui High

18:19.359 --> 18:21.274
Chess Club Champion
my senior year.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.408
Oh. Queen's Gambit, eh?

18:27.628 --> 18:30.413
So, you and Ben were buds, huh?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.154
Like two peas in a pod.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.590
That's what Ben says.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.377
Sometimes I
let him win.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.248
No one likes to
lose every time.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.423
That's what Ben says.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.165
Yeah, I can understand that.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.690
Checkmate.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.214
Want to play again?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.129
One, two, three, four.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.087
One, two, three, four.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.178
So, uh, what else
would you and Ben like to do?

18:56.222 --> 18:57.875
Mmm.

18:57.919 --> 19:01.488
We play chess every day
for two hours.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.185
Sometimes I let him win.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.665
Then we go to lunch.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.495
Ben has a ham and mustard
sandwich-- no lettuce.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.672
Ben doesn't
like lettuce.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.064
Lettuce is for rabbits.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.109
That's what Ben says.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.850
Ben says, "I am not a rabbit."

19:19.245 --> 19:22.378
Mmm. Then Ben goes and
watches TV in his room.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.727
Price Is Right,

19:23.771 --> 19:25.686
Wheel of Fortune,
Let's Make a Deal.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.557
Would you watch with him?No!

19:27.601 --> 19:29.429
I don't like TV.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.432
I like chess.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.089
Then we go to group.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.743
Then we go to dinner.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.441
Then it's lights-out.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.878
Same routine every day?

19:43.921 --> 19:45.140
Every day.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.011
Ben likes things
the same.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.230
Same thing every day.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.798
We all have our quirks. Ha-ha.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.669
Sure.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.584
So, when was the last time
you saw him?

19:58.153 --> 20:00.242
A few days ago.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.897
We had lunch. Then he
didn't show up for group.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.595
Mmm.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.425
So it was in between...

20:09.469 --> 20:10.774
when he went to go watch...

20:10.818 --> 20:12.254
Hang on a second.
Checkmate.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.908
Want to play again?

20:15.518 --> 20:17.216
One, two, three, four.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.913
Uh, sure.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.046
Uh, you said Ben would watch TV

20:22.090 --> 20:23.831
in his room
every day after lunch?

20:23.874 --> 20:25.789
Every day.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.443
Price Is Right,
Wheel of Fortune,

20:27.487 --> 20:29.097
Let's Make a Deal.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.186
Ben likes everything the same.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
We all have our quirks. Ha-ha.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.804
Figured you could
use one of these.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.023
Oh, God, you're an angel.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.503
Oh, wait. Leaded or unleaded?

20:43.546 --> 20:44.939
Leaded, definitely.

20:48.203 --> 20:51.293
Oh, so the paperwork
for Ben Pollard's room

20:51.337 --> 20:52.947
said there was a TV in there,

20:52.990 --> 20:55.297
but I didn't see one
when I was boxing up his stuff.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.126
I mean, last thing I want is the
boss thinking that I swiped it.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.302
Oh, you're fine.
I'm pretty sure it broke down.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.173
I remember maintenance
showed up a few days ago

21:02.217 --> 21:03.479
and hauled it off for repairs.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.438
Well, that probably
didn't go over too well.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.048
Harris said Ben
loved his TV time.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.702
Oh, yeah, there was drama
that morning.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.486
But there's a TV
in the common room.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.575
I'm pretty sure Ben
just watched his shows there.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.362
NARRATOR :
For the time being,

21:16.405 --> 21:19.278
none of the lions
is really prepared to risk

21:19.321 --> 21:21.149
the full-on violence of a fight
between adult males.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.847
It can take months
for a takeover to succeed.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.981
But they're already sizing
each other up.

21:27.024 --> 21:30.114
ANNOUNCER: Now, from
the Bob Barker Studio at CBS

21:30.158 --> 21:34.597
in Hollywood,
it's The Price Is Right!

21:37.034 --> 21:40.211
Almease Davis, come on down!

21:41.343 --> 21:44.694
Simba wisely retreats
from the skirmish

21:44.738 --> 21:46.305
and re-marks his territory.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.181
But the two new males stay
in the area.

21:55.792 --> 22:00.014
And Curtis Braswell,
come on down!

22:01.102 --> 22:03.539
Don't. Don't do that.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.063
Why not?
Ben said it was okay.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.717
Ben?

22:07.761 --> 22:09.153
No.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.372
Don't listen to him.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.592
You shouldn't change it.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.985
Everything okay here?

22:15.029 --> 22:17.510
You giving this fella
a hard time, Chad?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.468
It's fine.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.948
Really, everything's
under control.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.473
Okay.
Well, if you need my help,

22:24.517 --> 22:26.257
I'm right over there.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.087
You need to turn it back.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.917
What

22:33.961 --> 22:35.266
Please.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.746
You don't...

22:36.790 --> 22:38.748
You don't want
to get him angry.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.969
Get who angry?

22:45.102 --> 22:46.408
Kosaki.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.721
What happens
when Kosaki gets angry?

22:56.853 --> 22:58.115
Did he have a run

23:00.466 --> 23:01.945
Come on. You can tell me.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.600
Or maybe I should go over
and ask him what you meant.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.602
No.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.126
Ben...

23:09.170 --> 23:11.041
Ben came in here
the other day,

23:11.085 --> 23:12.608
put on The Price Is Right.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.957
Kosaki got mad.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.959
He pushed Ben.
He pushed him.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.308
What did Ben do then?

23:17.352 --> 23:18.832
Ben got upset.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.051
Said he was gonna tell
the doctors on Kosaki.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.270
Maybe even call the police.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.620
What did Kosaki do
when Ben said that?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.840
Kosaki got angry.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.538
Like... like, quiet angry.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.411
Then the orderlies came
and said to stop fighting,

23:32.454 --> 23:33.629
so... so Ben left.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.326
He left.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.894
And he ain't been
back here since.

You following me?

No, I just think we're

♪

24:31.339 --> 24:32.732
Hi. Come on.What is it?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.211
Junior got a lock
on Duke's burner.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.039
How did he do that?I have no idea.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.128
It was very technical, and I
don't understand these things

24:38.172 --> 24:40.087
'cause I'm 40, so... let's go.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.350
Hey. I don't know
how you did that,

24:42.393 --> 24:44.395
but I'm impressed.Oh, it was nothing, sir.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.049
I just had a hunch
that Sergeant Lukela

24:46.093 --> 24:48.443
had a burner on him when he
walked into the evidence room,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.532
so then I just checked
the HPD's router

24:50.576 --> 24:52.229
to see if the phone connected

24:52.273 --> 24:53.535
to the station's
public Wi-Fi.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.798
It did. Then it was just
a simple matter of going

24:55.842 --> 24:57.060
through the different
IP addresses...

24:57.104 --> 24:58.409
Junior. Where is he?

24:58.453 --> 24:59.715
Oh, uh...

24:59.759 --> 25:00.934
Waikiki Beach, sir.

25:01.761 --> 25:02.936
All right, keep tracking him.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.638
All right, Junior,
we're almost there.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.074
Any change in his position?Negative.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.207
He hasn't moved since
the first time I pinged him.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.557
All right, he's probably just
waiting to hand off the key.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.385
Yeah, which means
we can't go in hot.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.300
Okay, there's an alleyway
on your left.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.606
The signal's coming from there.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.869
All right,
we got Duke's car here.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.449
JUNIOR:
You're standing right on top

25:38.493 --> 25:39.450
of the signal.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.191
So, where's Duke?
Where is he?

25:44.151 --> 25:45.935
The trunk, Steve.

25:49.809 --> 25:50.940
Duke.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.209
Steve, I'm sorry.
I had no other choice.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.168
Look, we-we gotta
get out of here.Wait a minute.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.517
Just hold-hold on.
Hold on a second.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.997
It's okay.
We know about Akela, all right?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.868
You gotta tell us what's
going on, Duke. What happened?

26:05.912 --> 26:08.610
The key they had me steal--
it was to one of these lockers.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.004
They didn't know which one.
They just told me to go

26:11.047 --> 26:12.832
to whatever number
was on that key.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.616
I opened up the locker.
There was a bag inside.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.922
I unzipped the bag.
There was at least

26:15.965 --> 26:17.314
a million dollars inside, easy.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.665
I zipped the bag back up
and took it to the car.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.841
They were going to call me
with more instructions.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.277
But when I was putting the bag

26:23.320 --> 26:26.019
inside the trunk,
somebody came up behind me.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.368
STEVE: I mean, what,
the kidnappers jumped you?

26:27.411 --> 26:29.022
That doesn't make any sense.Why would somebody

26:29.065 --> 26:31.372
stuff you in a trunk? He just
said wait for instructions.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.201
Not to mention, where's the kid?
Where's Akela if it was them?

26:34.244 --> 26:35.855
Who is it?

26:35.898 --> 26:37.596
It's them.Put it on speaker.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.774
DISTORTED VOICE:
Do you have my money?

26:41.817 --> 26:43.689
Kidnappers don't have the money.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.560
I'll have Junior run a trace.All right.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.040
Stall him. Stall him.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.737
Look...

26:48.781 --> 26:50.217
I'll get your money,

26:50.260 --> 26:51.871
but I haven't been
to the lockers yet.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.525
HPD is looking for me,
and if they catch me,

26:54.569 --> 26:56.963
you won't be able
to get what you want.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.791
That'd be unfortunate
for your granddaughter.

26:58.834 --> 27:04.013
You have one hour. If you don't
have it by then, she's dead.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.928
I... I need to know she's okay.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.104
Let me... let me speak to her.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.019
AKELA: Papa?I'm here, sweetie.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.630
I'm here.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.196
Papa, I want to go home.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.894
It's going to be okay, ku'u lei.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.765
Just try to be brave.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.201
One hour.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.463
Uh-huh.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.161
Danny?No, not even close.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.989
We need to figure out
who else knew there was

27:23.032 --> 27:25.426
a big bag of money
in that locker.DANNY: Duke, how did that key

27:25.469 --> 27:27.210
end up in evidence
in the first place?

27:27.254 --> 27:28.951
Belonged to a drug dealer
named Tyler Musako.

27:28.995 --> 27:32.259
HPD picked him up the other day
on a hit-and-run.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.956
He had the key on him
when he was brought in.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.349
He's being held
in Halawa, no bail.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.046
All right, we need to go talk
to this guy right now.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.395
Already have.STEVE: What are you
talking about?

27:38.439 --> 27:39.658
When

27:39.701 --> 27:40.963
Right after the kidnappers
called me.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.312
Thought maybe he was
involved or at least

27:42.356 --> 27:43.487
could tell me who was.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.707
But he said he
didn't know anything.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.491
And my sense was
he was telling the truth.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.623
STEVE:
Duke, even if he

27:48.667 --> 27:49.885
wasn't involved,
through that phone call,

27:49.929 --> 27:51.017
you tipped him off,

27:51.060 --> 27:52.061
and somebody else
knew there was

27:52.105 --> 27:53.280
a bunch of money
in these lockers

27:53.323 --> 27:54.716
and was trying
to get their hands on it.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.109
DANNY: If I'm that guy,
the second you leave,

27:56.152 --> 27:57.806
what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna call somebody

27:57.850 --> 27:59.721
and tell him to keep eyes
on this locker, right?All right,

27:59.765 --> 28:01.418
we gotta look at the Halawa
phone records for this morning.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.942
Right?
Whoever Tyler Musako called,

28:02.985 --> 28:04.291
that's who we talk to next.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.640
Duke, follow us.
Come on.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.604
Oh, good.

28:13.648 --> 28:16.433
Look, I don't know
who you are, but know this:

28:16.477 --> 28:18.479
I'm a lawyer,
I know my rights,

28:18.522 --> 28:20.133
and I'm going to have
both your badges.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.612
TANI: The only thing
you're gonna have

28:21.656 --> 28:23.876
is my foot in your throat
if you don't shut up.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.965
GROVER:
Wait a second.
You're...

28:26.008 --> 28:27.618
Tyler Musako's lawyer, right?

28:27.662 --> 28:28.837
So?

28:28.881 --> 28:31.971
So... your client
had somebody rob a cop

28:32.014 --> 28:34.321
of a very large sum of money.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.627
What am I telling you for?
You already know that, right?

28:38.238 --> 28:41.632
Look, even if what you're saying
about Mr. Musako is true,

28:41.676 --> 28:44.026
how would I
possibly know about it?

28:44.070 --> 28:45.462
TANI:
Well...

28:45.506 --> 28:47.551
this morning, Mr. Musako
made one phone call from jail,

28:47.595 --> 28:49.205
and that phone call
was to you.

28:49.249 --> 28:52.208
So you either arranged
to have the money stolen

28:52.252 --> 28:53.601
or you just stole it yourself.

I-I suspect

28:56.430 --> 28:58.258
I'm not the first person
in this room

28:58.301 --> 29:01.217
to utter these words, but, um...

29:01.261 --> 29:03.132
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.352
Well, we kind of think you do.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.833
And you're gonna tell us
where that money is.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.967
Well, if you think
I'm involved in this,

29:12.011 --> 29:13.534
then, uh, prove it.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.971
Oh, wait.
Uh, prisoner phone calls

29:16.015 --> 29:18.582
between a lawyer and his client
aren't recorded, so...

29:18.626 --> 29:20.106
I guess you can't.

29:20.149 --> 29:23.805
Looks like your evidence
is entirely circumstantial.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.286
Mmm, maybe, yeah.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.679
But what we could do
is we could get a warrant,

29:28.723 --> 29:30.072
and we could dump
your phone,

29:30.116 --> 29:31.595
and we could find out the name

29:31.639 --> 29:34.207
of whatever scumbag you hired
to pull the job.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.513
GROVER: See, the problem
with doing that is, see,

29:36.557 --> 29:38.559
by then, it'll be too late.

29:38.602 --> 29:42.432
You see, someone else
is after that money.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.609
And they want it so bad

29:45.653 --> 29:47.437
that they were
willing to kidnap

29:47.481 --> 29:49.918
a cop's granddaughter
just to get it.

29:49.962 --> 29:53.443
So, here's how this
is gonna go down.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.489
You're either gonna tell us
where that money is--

29:55.532 --> 29:57.970
and I mean right now--
or you can keep acting

29:58.013 --> 29:59.710
like a smug little
wise-ass lawyer,

29:59.754 --> 30:01.451
and you're gonna find yourself
an accessory

30:01.495 --> 30:03.236

not so much.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.766
Take a right.

And you-- I'm guessing
orderly pay wasn't cutting it,

33:56.295 --> 34:00.560
so, uh... Mr. Shu offered
you a way to make some cash.
