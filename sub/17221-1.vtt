IS A FLIGHT RISK, NOT AN
AUDITION FOR A FEW GOOD MEN?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.721

CON TODO.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.956
- MM-HMM.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.825
DON'T WORRY, IT'S MILD.
- OH.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.894
- MM-HMM.
both: MMM.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.629
- YOU LIKE THAT?
- [chokes]

08:48.662 --> 08:51.198
MILD?
FOR WHO, THE DEVIL?

08:51.231 --> 08:52.600
[coughs]
GENE SIMMONS?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.835
I FEEL LIKE I JUST MADE OUT
WITH GODZILLA.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.670
IT'S MUY CALIENTE.
- [laughs]

08:56.704 --> 08:58.906
- WHOA, OKAY.
PERSONAL SPACE, DUDE.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.641
THAT ONE'S ON YOU.
HMM?

09:00.674 --> 09:01.775
- WHATEVER.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.943
- * HUMP DE BUMP, DOOP BODU

09:02.976 --> 09:05.112
* HUMP DE BUMP, DOOP BOP

09:05.145 --> 09:06.714
* HUMP DE BUMP

09:06.747 --> 09:08.081
- HEY, YOUR HONOR.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.917
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
THE BACK WAY.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
JUDGE HERNANDEZ
IS WAITING ON YOU.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.953
YOU SHOULD HAVE FILED
THAT MOTION.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.255
HE'S "OLD GUY ON THE VERGE
OF A ANEURYSM" MAD.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.924
OKAY?
HE'S LIKE...

09:16.957 --> 09:18.926
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I DEAL
WITH MENTALLY UNSTABLE CRIMINALS

09:18.959 --> 09:20.628
ALL DAY LONG,
AND I'M SURE I CAN HANDLE

09:20.661 --> 09:22.162
A SLIGHTLY IRRITATED
JUDGE HERNANDEZ.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.197
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.233
- OH.
I'M EATING A BOMB-SICLE.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.868
SECURITY SAYS WE HAVE
TO GO OUTSIDE TO EAT THEM

09:27.901 --> 09:29.336
BECAUSE IT INVOLVED
THE WORD "BOMB."

09:29.369 --> 09:30.771
CRAZY, RIGHT?

09:30.804 --> 09:33.841
2014 IS A TRIP.
- WORD.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.242
- LATER.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.177
- WELL, HEY, HEY, HEY.
- HEY.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.948
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW...

09:40.981 --> 09:42.950
- WHAT?
- ACCIDENTALLY RUN INTO ME LIKE,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.652
"OH, REBECCA, HEY.
WHAT'S UP, GIRL?"

09:44.685 --> 09:45.953
- NO, SMITH V. CLARK.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.120
YEAH, TESTIFYING
FOR THE DEFENSE.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.656
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
YOUR EGO.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.790
I MEAN, YOUR HONOR.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.791
- OUCH.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.659
- REALLY?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.627
- NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
I DON'T CARE.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.628
DO WHAT YOU WANT.
- A LITTLE BIT.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.796
YOU CARE A LITTLE BIT?
- UNH-UH.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.364
- COME ON.
BURN THROUGH A BOX OF CONDOMS

09:57.397 --> 09:59.900
AND A JUG OF TEQUILA,
YOU'LL COME CRAWLING BACK.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.201
- WHOA-HO, DON'T HOLD YOUR
BREATH, MY FRIEND.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.838
- WE'LL SEE.
- OH, COME--COME ON, GARY.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.273
HEY, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

10:06.306 --> 10:09.977
THIS IS YOUR HICKEY!

10:10.010 --> 10:12.680
THAT'S A SONG, YOU GUYS.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.814
* IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER *

10:13.847 --> 10:14.915
* THIS IS YOUR HICKEY, GARY

10:14.948 --> 10:17.117
* OH, OH

10:17.150 --> 10:18.418
[elevator bell rings]
- KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CASE

10:18.451 --> 10:19.687
BACK IN 1983--

10:19.720 --> 10:21.689
- MM-HMM.
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T

10:21.722 --> 10:22.990
LITTLE MISS TRAINWRECK.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.825
- THERE YOU ARE,
JUDGE HERNANDEZ.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.026
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.096
- JUDGE WRIGHT, I SPECIFICALLY
ASKED YOU TO FILE THAT MOTION.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.097
- I KNOW, SIR.
I'M SO SORRY.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.298
I HAD AN EMERGENCY COME UP.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.000
- NO, LYING.
SEE, THAT IS A LIE.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.736
SHE WAS OUT THERE
HELPING HER AT-RISK YOUTH.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.337
MIGHT I SUGGEST
AN OFFICIAL SANCTION?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.238
[phone rings]

10:38.271 --> 10:40.173
- COULD BE ANY CLOSER TO ME
RIGHT NOW?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.341
- SORRY.
- OH, SIR,

10:41.374 --> 10:42.342
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
JUST ONE MOMENT,

10:42.375 --> 10:43.744
I'VE GOT
TO TAKE THIS CALL.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.913
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DO NOT TAKE THAT CALL.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.682
YOU ARE A JUDGE,
NOT A SOCIAL WORKER.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.884
- FINE, OKAY.
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

10:50.918 --> 10:53.687
YOU CAN'T BLAME ROBBY FOR ME
NOT FILING THAT MOTION, OKAY?

10:53.721 --> 10:55.956
I WANTED THIS TO BE
A SURPRISE--THANK YOU, TOM.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.891
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- BUT I GOT TAPPED

10:57.925 --> 11:00.060
TO GIVE THE DUNHAM LAW
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.795
I'VE BEEN KIND OF LOST
IN MY SPEECH WRITING.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.396
- OH, YOU'RE THE KEYNOTE?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.298
- I AM.
- I'M A TRUSTEE.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.167
- YES, I KNOW THAT, SIR.
- I'LL BE THERE.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.468
- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
- OH, ME TOO.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.938
MAYBE WE SHOULD CAR POOL.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.873
LET'S JUST--WE'LL ALL MEET--
I'M GOING TO SEE HIM THERE TOO.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.074
OH, YOU JUST WORMED YOUR WAY

11:14.107 --> 11:15.809
OUT OF NOT FILING THAT MOTION.
- YEAH, I DID.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.878
- YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T
FILE THAT MOTI--

11:17.911 --> 11:19.312
HE'S GONE.
- GOD, YOUR GRASP--

11:19.346 --> 11:21.782
YOUR GRASP IS ALWAYS
JUST EXCEEDING THE REACH.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.183
OH, OH, OH, THAT MUST SUCK, HUH?
[phone rings]

11:23.216 --> 11:26.119
OH, LOOK, I GOT A CALL
FROM LINCOLN ELEMENTARY.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.989
I GOT TO TAKE IT.
JUDGE WRIGHT.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.323
- [mocking tone]
JUDGE WRIGHT.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.159
- I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY
JUDGE WRIGHT IS HERE

11:32.192 --> 11:33.761
FOR THIS MEETING.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.262
I MEAN,
IT IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.866
- MS. WRIGHT IS A MENTOR
AND A VERY IMPORTANT JUDGE.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.067
- [belches]

11:40.100 --> 11:41.802
EXCUSE ME, SO SORRY.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.236
I HAD WINE AND CAKE
FOR BREAKFAST.

11:43.270 --> 11:47.174
SO WHICH GANG
RECRUITED ROBBY?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.442
- A GANG?
THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.

11:49.476 --> 11:53.213
ROBBY DREW
AN OFFENSIVE PORTRAIT.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.750
- OKAY, APPARENTLY
I WAS MISLED AGAIN.

11:56.784 --> 12:00.387
MAY I SEE THE PICTURE,
PLEASE?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.922
OH.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.791
IT'S YOU, MR. THORPE.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.993
EXCEPT YOUR HEAD
IS A PENIS.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.095
ACTUALLY IT'S VERY GOOD.
HE REALLY GOT YOU.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.396
I MEAN,
DID YOU EVALUATE THIS?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.931
- I DID EVALUATE IT, YES.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.265
- SO, HERE'S THE STORY.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.769
ROBBY IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME
IN HIS GROUP HOME.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.838
HE'S A VICTIM OF BULLYING
AND FIGHTING.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.808
AND SO I'M SURE THIS
IS JUST A CRY OUT FOR ATTENTION.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.475
RIGHT, ROBBY?
- NO.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.878
I JUST THINK MR. THORPE'S HEAD
LOOKS LIKE A DONG.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.046
- THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.548
- MR. THORPE,
CAN WE JUST LOOK AT THIS

12:28.581 --> 12:32.052
AS AN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION
OF A FRUSTRATED CHILD

12:32.085 --> 12:33.954
WHO WOULD BENEFIT MORE
FROM GUIDANCE

12:33.987 --> 12:36.389
AND UNDERSTANDING
RATHER THAN PUNISHMENT?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.358
- I DON'T LIKE IT.
- I UNDERSTAND.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.962
- I REALIZE I HAVE
AN ODDLY SHAPED HEAD.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.296
BUT I'M SENSITIVE ABOUT IT.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.832
- MR. THORPE, I UNDERSTAND,

12:44.865 --> 12:48.501
AND IF YOU'LL JUST
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS,

12:48.535 --> 12:50.938
I PROMISE YOU
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.472
THANKS SO MUCH, AND YOU MIGHT
WANT TO JUST CONSIDER

12:52.505 --> 12:54.174
SWITCHING YOUR PART.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.542
MIGHT HELP COVER
THE CURVATURE.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.576
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.812
- I'D BE HAPPY TO DO
PORTRAITS OF YOUR FAMILY.

12:58.846 --> 13:02.515
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
- OH, COME ON NOW.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.783
[grunts]

13:15.228 --> 13:17.865
- FIRST OFF, YOU GOT TO STOP
LYING TO GET ME TO SHOW UP.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.566
IT'S NOT COOL.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.069
SECOND, YOU GOT TO NOTIFY
THE HEAD OF THE GROUP HOME,

13:22.102 --> 13:23.370
DOCUMENT THE BULLYING,

13:23.403 --> 13:25.873
AND THEN FILE
A POLICE REPORT.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.044
ALL RIGHT.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.413
WHEN THIS KID ALFONSO
COMES AT YOU,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.916
YOU HOLD UP YOUR HANDS
LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID TO FIGHT.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.085
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
AND THEN BOOM!

13:38.118 --> 13:41.621
YOU PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.125
NOTHING SCARES A BULLY
LIKE SEEING HIS OWN BLOOD.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.928
HMM?
- YOU KNOW,

13:47.961 --> 13:49.562
THAT'S THE BEST ADVICE
A GROWN-UP'S GIVEN ME

13:49.596 --> 13:51.932
IN A LONG TIME.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.400
- REALLY?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.235
YOU THINK I'M A GROWN-UP?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.237
- WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME,

13:57.270 --> 13:58.638
THEN YOU REALLY
GOT PROBLEMS.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.241
- NICE.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.043
ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE
YOUR RIGHT.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.177
AGAIN, HARDER.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.345
YEAH.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.214
GET OUT OF MY VAN.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.616
MR. RILLER,
BEFORE I PRONOUNCE SENTENCING,

14:09.649 --> 14:12.385
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
OR ANYONE ON YOUR BEHALF

14:12.419 --> 14:14.321
WOULD LIKE TO SAY?
- YOUR HONOR,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.423
MRS. RILLER AND MRS. RILLER
HAVE AGREED

14:16.456 --> 14:19.659
TO PETITION THE COURT
FOR LENIENCY.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.628
- YOUR HONOR,
I KNEW DOUGLAS RILLER

14:21.661 --> 14:24.197
AS A LOVING HUSBAND
AND FATHER TO MY TWO CHILDREN

14:24.231 --> 14:25.899
FROM A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.935
- YOUR HONOR,
I TOO KNEW DOUGLAS RILLER

14:27.968 --> 14:31.404
AS A LOVING HUSBAND
AND FATHER TO OUR TWO DOBERMANS.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.308
AND ALTHOUGH I AM
NOT HAPPY ABOUT HIS LIES,

14:35.342 --> 14:38.111
I HAVE TO SAY THAT HE'S
ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME

14:38.145 --> 14:41.048
WHEN I'M SICK,
AND SUPPORTIVE WHEN I WAS DOWN.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.917
- HE WAS ALSO THERE FOR ME
WHEN I WAS SICK,

14:43.951 --> 14:45.452
AND SUPPORTIVE
WHEN I WAS DOWN,

14:45.485 --> 14:48.355
EXCEPT FOR A FEW TIMES WHEN SHE
WAS SICK AT THE SAME TIME.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.157
THEN IT GOT TRICKY.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.658
- WOW.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.994
I'M SORRY.
PLEASE CONTINUE.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.930
- THE POINT IS
DOUGLAS WAS THERE FOR US.

14:56.964 --> 14:57.998
DID HE LIE?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.067
DID HE DECEIVE?
YES.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.535
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ISN'T ANY RELATIONSHIP,

15:02.569 --> 15:05.205
ROMANTIC OR OTHERWISE,
ABOUT SHOWING UP FOR SOMEONE

15:05.238 --> 15:06.974
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

15:07.007 --> 15:10.210
ABOUT SOMEONE BEING THERE FOR
SOMEONE WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.312
HOW MANY OF US
HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THAT?

15:12.345 --> 15:13.680
WELL, I HAVE.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.582
AND I'M THANKFUL FOR IT.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.352
- SO PLEASE,
SHOW DOUGLAS MERCY, PLEASE.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.688
- OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.124
EFFED UP ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.259
- MR. RILLER, I SENTENCE YOU
TO TIME SERVED

15:26.293 --> 15:28.228
FOR THE CHARGES OF BIGAMY,
AND ONE MONTH

15:28.261 --> 15:31.164
FOR THE CHARGE OF FALSIFYING
IDENTITY AND FRAUD.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.565
ADDITIONALLY I SENTENCE YOU

15:32.599 --> 15:35.002
TO TAKE A COURSE
IN FEMINISM,

15:35.035 --> 15:38.505
THE COLLEGE OF YOUR CHOICE
WHILE WEARING THIS T-SHIRT

15:38.538 --> 15:40.073
TO CLASS EVERY DAY.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.976
- WHAT?
HOW AM I GONNA PICK UP GIRLS?

15:46.413 --> 15:46.546
.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.015
- [muttering]
CONGRATULATIONS.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.050
BUT THE EXHILIRATING AND
TERRIFYING TRUTH IS THAT--

15:50.083 --> 15:52.419
[knock at door]
NOT NOW, GO AWAY, BAD TIME.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.354
[knocking continues]
I SAID GO AWAY.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.622
ARE YOU DEAF?

16:00.427 --> 16:03.196
- I PUNCHED ALFONSO
LIKE YOU SAID.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.431
- DUDE, I MEAN YOUR TIMING--

16:04.464 --> 16:06.699
YOUR TIMING
IS NOT VERY GOOD.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.201
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF WRITING A SPEECH.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.502
I GOT TO GO.
- HE'S GOT BROTHERS,

16:09.536 --> 16:12.105
AND COUSINS,
AND ONE REALLY BIG,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.341
AND I MEAN BIG,
BIG SISTER.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.276
- ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.
YOU CALL YOUR CASE WORKER.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.377
ALL RIGHT?
TELL HER TONIGHT.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.446
AND THEN I WILL DEAL
WITH THIS TOMORROW, FIRST THING.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.581
- THEY SAID THEY'RE SENDING ME
TO EDGEWATER.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.017
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.452
- EDGEWATER?
- YEAH.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.254
- NO.
EDGEWATER'S AW--

16:27.287 --> 16:29.756
EDGEWATER IS FOR SUPER,
SUPER VIOLENT KIDS.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.358
THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.460
- YOU TOLD ME TO HIT HIM.
- I KNOW. I KNOW I DID, OKAY?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.461
IT'S MY FAULT.
I'M GONNA FIX IT.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.029
I'M GONNA FIX IT.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.131
- I'LL STAY AT YOUR PLACE.
- NO, NO, YOU WON'T.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.267
NOBODY LIVES WITH ME.
I MEAN, I DON'T KEEP ANYTHING--

16:40.300 --> 16:41.434
I KILLED A CACTUS.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.336
- ALL I NEED IS A WARM GARAGE

16:43.370 --> 16:45.172
AND A COLD PIZZA.
- [sighs]

16:45.205 --> 16:47.440
COME ON, I GOT TO GO.
LET'S GO.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.043
ROBBY, HONEY, DUDE,
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY THINK

16:50.077 --> 16:51.578
I'M THIS, YOU KNOW,
AWESOME JUDGE

16:51.611 --> 16:53.446
WHO HAS IT ALL TOGETHER.
- NOPE.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.381
I THINK YOU'RE A MESS.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
BUT YOU OWE ME ONE.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.351
- OH, WHAT I OWE YOU, SIR,
BY LAW,

16:58.385 --> 17:00.453
IS A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT
FOR THE NEXT 58 DAYS

17:00.487 --> 17:01.254
UNTIL YOUR MOM GETS OUT.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.057
I AM NOT A SUITABLE ANYTHING,
OKAY?

17:04.091 --> 17:05.492
I'M A WORKAHOLIC FREAKSHOW.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.162
I EAT CRAP ALL DAY,
I DRINK UNTIL I DROP, YOU KNOW?

17:09.196 --> 17:11.064
I MIGHT
BINGE-WATCH LOCK-UP,

17:11.098 --> 17:12.765
'CAUSE I PUT
HALF OF THOSE GUYS IN THERE.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.068
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I HAVE
TO TIE A ROPE

17:15.102 --> 17:16.436
FROM MY ANKLE TO THE BED

17:16.469 --> 17:17.737
'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I DO AT NIGHT.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.140
- SO YOU GET TO KEEP
WRECKING MY LIFE?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.741
FIRST, YOU PUT
MY PARENTS AWAY,

17:21.774 --> 17:24.444
THEN YOU GOT ME KICKED OUT OF
A HALFWAY DECENT GROUP HOME,

17:24.477 --> 17:27.847
AND NOW I HAVE TO GO LIVE
WITH VIOLENT GUYS?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.449
COME ON, JUDGE.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.220
CAN'T YOU JUST PUT ME BACK
THE WAY YOU FOUND ME?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.488
- [knocking]

17:37.424 --> 17:38.691
- LET'S JUST STICK
TO THE PROTOCOL

17:38.725 --> 17:40.860
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT,
AND YEAH,

17:40.893 --> 17:41.861
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
- I NEED A FAVOR.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.096
- ONE SECOND.
- YEAH, YEAH.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.097
- DON'T THANK ME, MAN.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.398
HEALING IS A TEAM SPORT.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.866
- OKAY, I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WATCH YOU PRETEND

17:46.899 --> 17:49.736
TO BE ON THE PHONE
WITH PATIENTS.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.271
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY CRAWL HERE,

17:51.304 --> 17:53.273
BUT YOU'RE HERE.
OH, AND YOU BROUGHT A DATE.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.441
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY TAKING
THIS WHOLE COUGAR THING

17:54.474 --> 17:55.642
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.478
- ALL RIGHT, ROBBY SHOEMAKER,
DR. GARY BOYD.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.647
I NEED A LETTER
FROM AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD

18:00.680 --> 18:03.650
STATING THAT ROBBY
IS NOT A VIOLENT CHILD,

18:03.683 --> 18:06.386
BUT THAT HE WAS ACTING
IN SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST A BULLY

18:06.419 --> 18:08.121
SO THAT HE CAN STAY
IN HIS CURRENT GROUP HOME,

18:08.155 --> 18:09.189
AND NOT GET TRANSFERRED
TO EDGEWATER.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.623
- OOH, EDGEWATER?
YIKES.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.226
- 58 DAYS, MAN.
IT'S THE HOME STRETCH.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.195
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP YOUR
HANDS TO YOURSELF FOR THAT LONG?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.397
- IN MY SLEEP. I'M NOT LIKE
THE JUDGE OVER HERE.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.466
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- RIGHT, LET'S GO. WE'RE LATE.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.134
- GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

18:21.168 --> 18:25.472
THE EXHILARATING
AND TERRIFYING TRUTH IS THAT

18:25.505 --> 18:29.542
NOTHING ADEQUATELY PREPARES YOU
FOR HOW IT FEELS

18:29.576 --> 18:31.344
TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.879
IS THERE A CHANCE
THAT YOU WILL BE

18:32.912 --> 18:35.448
SWALLOWED WHOLE
BY YOUR JOB?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.784
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.419
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'LL BE USING

18:39.452 --> 18:41.321
THE NEAREST TEASPOON
AS YOUR MAKEUP MIRROR,

18:41.354 --> 18:44.257
OR TO ADJUST THE KNOT
IN YOUR TIE.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.426
AND IT'S GONNA FREAK YOU OUT
AT FIRST, BY THE WAY,

18:46.459 --> 18:50.163
BECAUSE NO ONE TELLS YOU
THAT YOU APPEAR UPSIDE DOWN

18:50.197 --> 18:52.332
IN A SPOON, BUT YOU DO.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.933
AND IT'S AN
EXCELLENT REMINDER

18:53.966 --> 18:57.404
BECAUSE THE VERY SPIRIT
OF THE LAW

18:57.437 --> 19:01.308
IS ABOUT MAKING THINGS
RIGHT SIDE UP

19:01.341 --> 19:05.345
AND DOING WHATEVER YOU CAN
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

19:05.378 --> 19:10.350
[applause]

19:10.383 --> 19:12.252
- OH, WHAT'S UP?
THERE'S MY MAN.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.287
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU--
NO, HE CAN'T BE IN HERE.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.288
HE UNDERAGED.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.325
- HERE'S MY I.D.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.526
- GIVE ME THAT.
- LOOKS OFFICIAL TO ME.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.596
- OH, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR
MEDICAL DEGREE, DR. LEE TRANG?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.531
- HEY, GUYS.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.300
YOU KNOW MARY HARMON
FROM CHILD SERVICES?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.336
- YOU GOT HIM IN A BAR, REBECCA?
AT 10:00 P.M.?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.903
- I THOUGHT IT WAS 9:30.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.374
- AND THIS WILL KEEP ROBBY
OUT OF EDGEWATER PERMANENTLY.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.410
- NICE.
DRINKS ON THE HOUSE, EVERYONE.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.578
THE JUDGE IS BUYING.
- WHAT?

19:38.611 --> 19:39.746
NO, I'M NOT BUYING.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.381
I'M NOT BUYING DRINKS.
I'M VERY CHEAP.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.315
ALL RIGHT, OH, HEY, HEY.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.651
DON'T FORGET THIS, ALL RIGHT?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.753
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JUDGE.
- YOU GOT IT.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.754
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

19:47.787 --> 19:48.588
- OKAY.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.458
- AND YEAH, YEAH,
CALL ME ANYTIME.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.892
ANY TIME AT ALL, ROBBY.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.794
PREFERABLY DURING
BUSINESS HOURS.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.829
HEY, HEY, HEY,
JUDGE HERNANDEZ.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.298
THAT WAS ROBBY SHOEMAKER.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.466
YEAH, I KEPT HIM
OFF THE STREETS,

19:59.499 --> 20:01.434
OUT OF JUVIE, TURNS OUT.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.404
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TAKE THE CALL.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.938
- HOW CAN I BE MAD
AT YOU

20:05.972 --> 20:07.407
AFTER THAT GREAT SPEECH
YOU GAVE TONIGHT?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.909
- OH.
- TRULY.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.378
IN FACT, I'M GONNA
BUY YOU A ROUND.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.379
- OH.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.780
- ANYTHING YOU LIKE...

20:13.813 --> 20:16.516
FROM THE TWO BOTTOM SHELVES.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.718
- BARTENDER, HI.
CAN YOU GET THE McALLISTER 24,

20:18.751 --> 20:20.720
THROW THAT ON THE BOTTOM SHELF,
GET US A ROUND?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.955
MAKE HERS A DOUBLE.
- SEE, GARY?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.991
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE
MY FAVORITE GARY.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.894
WELL, ACTUALLY BUSEY IS.
GARY BUSEY'S STRONG.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.596
BUT YOU'RE SECOND.
- BUSEY? HE'S GONNA BEAT ME?

20:29.629 --> 20:32.399
- YES.
THANK YOU FOR THE LETTER.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.600
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.802
[The Donnas' Dancing With Myself
plays]

20:35.835 --> 20:37.404
- THIS SONG.
I LOVE THIS SONG.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.938
- OH! GIVE HER SOME ROOM.
GIVE HER A WIDE BERTH, GUYS.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.540
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE HER
SOME PERSONAL SPACE.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.309
- YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.
- OH!

20:42.342 --> 20:43.376
- [scatting]
- JUDGE, YOU GOTTA STOP THAT.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.411
- ALL RIGHT.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.379
ACTUALLY, I KIND OF HURT
MY NECK.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.680
[laughter]
ALL RIGHT.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.781
ANYWAY.
HERE'S TO US.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.383
- YEAH!
- HEY!

20:50.417 --> 20:51.451
- * DANCING WITH MYSELF

20:51.484 --> 20:52.619
* OH OH OH

20:52.652 --> 20:54.521
* DANCING WITH MYSELF

20:54.554 --> 20:55.522

20:55.555 --> 20:57.957
* DANCING WITH MYSELF
