04:28.790 --> 04:35.120
climb at the bottom of the ocean with my

04:30.500 --> 04:47.590
bare hook can I open it I think it's

04:35.120 --> 04:56.140
going to be that was something maybe

04:47.590 --> 04:56.140
cover maybe you should ask me something

04:58.150 --> 05:12.070
we should probably go get go the-- she's

05:08.300 --> 05:15.610
her itching my teas are itchy

05:12.070 --> 05:18.040
she says that's a good sign means it's

her scar

05:39.160 --> 05:44.530
it matches the keyhole yeah and it looks

05:41.230 --> 05:46.390
like a dragon bite to me oh it is but

05:44.530 --> 05:48.180
she doesn't like to talk about it she

05:46.390 --> 05:50.770
doesn't like to talk about anything oh

05:48.180 --> 05:53.950
that's why she writes in the dirt with

05:50.770 --> 05:55.990
her stick that was just like her thing

05:53.950 --> 05:58.090
yeah like snotlout being a woman

repelling babies the stick to itch the

05:58.090 --> 06:02.860
teeth what are you going after her

06:00.850 --> 06:05.380
we have to find out what kind of Dragon

06:02.860 --> 06:08.410
made that scar it could be the key to

06:05.380 --> 06:10.350
opening the dragon I hold on I have ways

06:08.410 --> 06:13.050
of making her talk

06:10.350 --> 06:14.360

06:38.949 --> 06:48.349
now tell me about this bite mark I was a

06:44.960 --> 06:51.740
turkey neck teenager

06:48.349 --> 06:54.650
sorry I had their longing to climb

06:51.740 --> 06:57.830
glacier island to find pure glacial

06:54.650 --> 07:03.379
water known for its healing properties

06:57.830 --> 07:07.509
so I went with two vegetables baking

07:03.379 --> 07:07.509
sorry I'm a bit rusty

07:09.940 --> 07:15.140
we had only been at a summit for a few

07:13.040 --> 07:19.430
hours we were hit by a terrible

07:15.140 --> 07:25.370
snowstorm that's when it attacked it was

07:19.430 --> 07:28.000
vicious relentless and impossible to see

07:25.370 --> 07:28.000
in the White House

ever

08:11.560 --> 08:17.260

08:14.470 --> 08:22.750

08:51.640 --> 08:56.470
Wraith I get that but you also remember

08:54.580 --> 08:59.380
how it was to be my age to want to

08:56.470 --> 09:01.630
explore to need to see what else is out

08:59.380 --> 09:03.830
there to get answers to questions you

09:31.839 --> 09:37.390
doesn't have any information on it can

09:34.210 --> 09:39.010
you believe this a brand new dragon it's

sorry excited about the new dragon

09:44.110 --> 09:48.279

09:45.970 --> 09:50.920
wiped out Goofy's entire search party

09:48.279 --> 09:52.660
that would be correct so worth the long

09:50.920 --> 09:54.220
flight speak for yourself

09:52.660 --> 09:56.940

of here

12:55.529 --> 13:00.449
that looks like a huge storm no we

12:58.470 --> 13:02.879
should dig in here and wait for the snow

13:00.449 --> 13:06.300
race to show itself remember it likes to

13:02.879 --> 13:08.660
attack when you can't see it great just

15:06.089 --> 15:10.170
I have a question hiccup what exactly is

15:08.220 --> 15:12.209
our plan to get a snow Wraith to take it

15:10.170 --> 15:14.730
out of one of our dead bodies augers

15:12.209 --> 15:15.629
well be rough Nets dead body and the

15:14.730 --> 15:17.550
Wraith teeth

15:15.629 --> 15:20.699
well not quiet go if he wants to tell us

15:17.550 --> 15:23.750
something she says we should have left

15:20.699 --> 15:23.750
when we had the chance

15:26.220 --> 15:33.690
[Music]

15:30.410 --> 15:36.440
don't you worry Agner I've seen her with

15:33.690 --> 15:41.340
this stomach here up a thousand times

15:36.440 --> 15:51.630
one dab I have yak will that be one eye

15:41.340 --> 15:52.200
or a dab of an eye drink this three

15:51.630 --> 15:54.270
times a day

15:52.200 --> 15:57.420
and come back and see me if it doesn't

15:54.270 --> 16:02.130
kill you huh I'm just kidding

15:57.420 --> 16:03.600
oh okay that thing was gnarly Astrid are

16:02.130 --> 16:06.270
you okay yep

16:03.600 --> 16:08.670
barely hiccup you know I want to shot at

16:06.270 --> 16:10.290
this as badly as you but maybe we should

16:08.670 --> 16:12.330
get out of here we're just sitting ducks

16:10.290 --> 16:13.020
in the store I went wait a minute what

16:12.330 --> 16:15.090
did you just say

16:13.020 --> 16:18.510
he said we're sitting ducks and for once

16:15.090 --> 16:21.000
I agree with him sitting ducks yes yes

16:18.510 --> 16:23.940
yes that's exactly what we need to be

16:21.000 --> 16:25.920
excuse me what if we could make the snow

16:23.940 --> 16:28.680
race think it sees us when we're not

16:25.920 --> 16:30.840
here you can make yourself invisible as

16:28.680 --> 16:32.460
he get to do all the cool stuff and I

16:30.840 --> 16:35.040
used to just sit here with you as a

16:32.460 --> 16:37.140
sister will you two be quiet for 10

16:35.040 --> 16:39.300
second toughs not that far off

16:37.140 --> 16:41.460
look the snow race didn't have any

16:39.300 --> 16:43.470
trouble seeing us until snotlout got

16:41.460 --> 16:45.480
buried in the snow and then go 'they

16:43.470 --> 16:47.670
said it couldn't find her when she fell

16:45.480 --> 16:50.370
into a snowbank I think that's because

16:47.670 --> 16:52.110
it sees body heat in the same way

16:50.370 --> 16:53.730
toothless can find things with sound

16:52.110 --> 16:55.950
we'll use this to our advantage to

16:53.730 --> 16:58.080
confuse it then whilst distracted will

16:55.950 --> 17:00.399
net it and get that tooth and you're

16:58.080 --> 17:04.390
sure it will work

17:00.399 --> 17:06.699
of course not I hate you you know that

17:04.390 --> 17:09.779
yes I am aware of that all right gang

17:06.699 --> 17:09.779
let's get to work

17:11.069 --> 17:15.878
pretty good now if I'm right when we

17:14.259 --> 17:18.159
light these on fire the snow Wraith will

17:15.878 --> 17:19.868
think they're us and attack then we'll

17:18.159 --> 17:21.220
have a drop on it what am I wait well

17:19.868 --> 17:23.259
you know realistically gorgeous my

17:21.220 --> 17:26.559
statue is I can't in good conscience

17:23.259 --> 17:28.148
send that into flames I'll work through
