WEBVTT

00:06.330 --> 00:08.366
-Your last deal
came to about $2.2 mil.

00:08.410 --> 00:11.493
I want half
or the entire score
will be seized.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.149
- Hey, Niclq. It's your father.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.991
I need you
to move these funds.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.116
-That's not gonna happen!
-They're gonna kill me.

00:17.160 --> 00:21.324
-What if there was a currency
with no borders, no threat
of confiscation?

00:21.370 --> 00:23.827
-With the money I am
prepared to give you, we can
turn this into something

00:23.910 --> 00:25.992
that has the power
to change the world.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.149
-Hi, GenCoin.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.821
-Jey-Jey will want
me to waste him.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.036
-You got big dreams,
huh, Big Ronnie?

00:32.080 --> 00:33.616
You're making moves
with that money or what?

00:34.910 --> 00:36.116
-Where's your dad?

00:36.160 --> 00:38.617
-There's no record of you
here in our system.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.535
-Help!

01:04.580 --> 01:06.150
-Help!

01:06.250 --> 01:08.241
Help!

01:09.660 --> 01:11.446
Help!

01:13.040 --> 01:15.611
Help!

01:36.160 --> 01:38.037
-Okay. Okay.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.819
What did I do?

01:41.830 --> 01:43.536
-Shh, shh.
-Where am I?

01:43.620 --> 01:45.110
Just tell me what I did.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.036
Damn.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.616
You ever been hit
like that before, dawg?

02:09.410 --> 02:10.570
Throw ya off your shit,
don't it?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.569
Makes you all woozy.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.195
You know why
I brought ya out here?

02:20.500 --> 02:24.652
Hey, yo!
South Beach, you with me?

02:24.660 --> 02:27.197
Only reason anybody
come out here...

02:27.290 --> 02:30.157
is to catch a gator
or feed a gator.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.993
And I don't care for gator meat.
You chew that shit forever.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.190
-This is a mistake.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.320
This is a mistake.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.746
-You're Nick, ain't you?

02:46.200 --> 02:50.614
Your bitch-ass daddy,
he say he could
take our cash,

02:50.660 --> 02:53.072
clean it up, make it safe.

02:54.410 --> 02:55.991
Next thing you know,
the money gone.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.366
Ain't that some shit?

03:01.500 --> 03:02.615
So, here's what's up...

03:03.660 --> 03:05.491
You tell me where
your old man at...

03:06.950 --> 03:08.827
or you turn into gator food.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.617
It'll makes no difference to me.
I know I'mma get that shit
eventually.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.651
When I'm done with you...

03:13.660 --> 03:15.946
I'm goin' right on
down the line.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.444
Every sorry-ass bitch
you care about,

03:17.500 --> 03:20.697
right down to the nigga
that does your dry cleaning.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.401
You, I'll probably
shoot you at the back
of the head right there.

03:24.450 --> 03:25.656
Just be done with it.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.110
But your loved ones?

03:30.620 --> 03:31.609
Shit.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.196
You should see what I can
do with a blade.

03:41.830 --> 03:45.197
It's amazing how long
you can stay alive

03:45.290 --> 03:47.110
-with your guts
all hangin' out--
-I have your money.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.035
I have your money.

04:28.540 --> 04:29.689
-Oh, shit!

04:31.870 --> 04:33.246
- Isabelle!
- Sorry.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.746
It's that circuit board again.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.111
I've been meaning
to get a new one.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.240
Marta!

04:38.290 --> 04:40.406
-_ Isabelle!
- I got It, Ma. Hang on!

04:40.450 --> 04:43.157
-I was in the middle of
e-mailing. Now I have
to start over?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.440
It happens.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.149
-Only when you're
here, it happens.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.077
Marta,
settle down, okay?

04:48.120 --> 04:50.941
Oh, yeah.
Don't walk away from me.
- Mom, just chill. Okay?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.696
- Okay.
- End of the week, Chica.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.866
End of the week.
I want you out end
of the week.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.493
Seriously,
the power went out again?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.070
What happened?

05:09.660 --> 05:11.821
- Hello?
Where are you
right now?

05:37.080 --> 05:38.490
It's open!

05:39.700 --> 05:42.828
Izzy, this is Ronald.
Ronald, Izzy.

05:42.830 --> 05:47.369
Um, it turns out
some of the money
that I gave you...

05:47.410 --> 05:50.322
belonged to Ronald
and he would very much
like it back.

05:50.370 --> 05:52.326
-How much is some?

05:52.330 --> 05:55.117
Uh, $300,000.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.991
Did you bring your laptop?

05:59.160 --> 06:00.570
- Should we do the pitch?

06:01.830 --> 06:03.070
-What are you talking about?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.991
- Fucking GenCoin!

06:06.040 --> 06:08.497
-I don't think he gives
a fuck about GenCoin.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.655
-Listen, Ronald,

06:12.700 --> 06:15.533
Nick went ahead and invested
your money In a startup.

06:15.580 --> 06:18.117
My startup, GenCoin.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.321
It's the future of currency.

06:20.370 --> 06:21.530
Here, let me just show you.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.865
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Wait, wait.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.866
Wait, wait, wait.
-Easy. Easy.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.320
Easy.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.321
-It's just my laptop
and a prospectus.

06:34.950 --> 06:37.032
Just-- just hear me out.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.826
Please, just--

06:38.910 --> 06:42.152
that three hundred,
it started off as cash,
yeah? I'm assuming.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.118
Under some floor board
or mattress or whatever!

06:46.500 --> 06:49.287
Believe me, I know.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.824
My family, we used to be
clipped up with the Cuban Mafia
back in the day.

06:53.870 --> 06:56.748
IfI had created
GenCoin back then,
they would have been

06:56.790 --> 07:02.399
moving money internationally,
locally, completely undetected.

07:02.450 --> 07:05.578
Forget scamming the bank.
They would have been the bank.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.406
Look.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.448
If you invest in GenCoin,
help us make this a real thing,

07:13.500 --> 07:16.321
okay, your money, it turns
into a digital currency.

07:16.330 --> 07:20.289
It's untaxed,
unregulated, untraceable.

07:20.330 --> 07:23.948
Suddenly, you're not
on_ some corner
slinging rocks.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.822
You're moving whatever you want,
in the comfort of your own home.

07:27.830 --> 07:31.038
It's_the future--
not just of crIme,

07:31.080 --> 07:32.445
but of commerce.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.539
It's the future
of a truly free market.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.787
The question is, Ronald...

07:43.910 --> 07:45.320
do you wanna be
a part of it?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.240
-Come here.

08:04.410 --> 08:06.492
Sit.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.116
-I am sitting.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.570
-I just wanna talk.

08:11.750 --> 08:12.899
-Just do what he says.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.150
-What you say
your name was, again?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.781
-Izzy.
-Izzy.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.616
Is it short for Isabelle?

08:37.660 --> 08:39.366
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

08:40.950 --> 08:42.156
That's pretty.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.826
I want my money, Isabelle.

08:45.910 --> 08:49.152
-I can-- I-- I can make
a transfer to any bank account.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.287
-No, no, no. Come on!

08:51.330 --> 08:54.993
You don't wanna do all that.
Just give me the cash.
You feel me?

08:55.040 --> 08:58.612
-Yeah, but no bank
has that much cash on hand.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.742
I need a couple of days.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.280
-Couple of days?

09:05.580 --> 09:06.649
Hmm.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.866
Here's the thing, Isabelle.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.696
I need cash.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.570
A'ight?

09:14.660 --> 09:17.037
If it's sitting
in some bank somewhere,
that shit ain't my problem.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.496
That shit's your problem.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.360
That shit is
South Beach problem.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.657
24 hours.
We meet back here.

09:26.660 --> 09:29.493
You give me my three hundred...

09:29.500 --> 09:31.650
in cash.

09:31.660 --> 09:32.991
If you don't do that...

09:34.450 --> 09:35.439
Well...

09:38.450 --> 09:39.439
shit.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.496
-I'm sorry.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.115
Hey, good morning.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.616
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.280
What time did you
get in last night?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.611
-Rea|ly late.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.652
Eric was just so wasted.
I had to drive him.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.656
-Um, do you know
where my socks are?

13:19.700 --> 13:22.692
-Mmm. Probably in a box.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.650
-Do you know what box?
-No.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.533
-All right.
-There's so many boxes.

13:27.620 --> 13:31.499
Mmm. Okay, I'm up!

13:31.540 --> 13:34.612
-Um, your phone
has been ringing
off the hook.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.406
-Sorry.
-That's fine.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.610
Mmm.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.362
-That sort of client
information is-- well,

13:52.410 --> 13:53.616
I need a subpoena.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.742
I-- I hope you understand.
-No, that's fine.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.941
Of course. But listen,
if anyone does hear
from Andrew, then, uh...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.649
please call me,
immediately.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.748
And, uh, I'll be back
with that subpoena.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.900
-Come again.
-All right.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.194
-I'm sorry, I wish
I could do more--

14:06.250 --> 14:08.536
-No, please.
You're just doing your job.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.326
You are, right?
-Yeah.

14:10.370 --> 14:12.326
-Just doing your job?
-That's right.

14:12.370 --> 14:13.655
-Fine job it is.
-Thank you.

14:13.660 --> 14:14.649
-Take care, Carl.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.742
-You sure this is gonna work?

14:21.790 --> 14:24.941
You mean, he can just trade us
a bunch of routing numbers
for cash and that's it?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.991
Huh? How do you
know this guy?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.860
-Stop talking.

14:30.910 --> 14:33.617
-Okay. Well,
it's just 300 grand is a lot
to come up with in one day--

14:33.660 --> 14:35.070
-Well, you should
have thought about that

14:35.120 --> 14:36.826
before you took
the money from
some Haitian gangster.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.610
-Hey, you didn't
want to know. Okay?

14:38.660 --> 14:40.537
-Nick, if he hadn't
seen my face,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.901
you would be
on your own right now.
-You took the money, Izzy.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.070
You took the money,
just remember that.
You took the money.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.151
-Rea|ly?
-What the hell?

14:47.160 --> 14:49.902
Hey! What are you doing?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.149
Izzy!

14:54.500 --> 14:55.819
Hey, where are you going?

14:57.450 --> 14:58.997
Where are you going?
-For a walk.

15:00.830 --> 15:03.993
-Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't know it was his.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.491
-So who gave you that money?
-My dad.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.656
He works in finance.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.362
He launders money
through his bank.
-For Haitians?

15:12.410 --> 15:15.652
-For anyone.
Just literally anyone
who will pay him.

15:15.700 --> 15:19.079
-You gave me the money to hide.
-No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.441
I gave it to you
because I believe in this.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.071
I want to do it. I swear.
-Okay.

15:24.160 --> 15:28.039
-Look, I've spent
my entire life watching
this man line his pockets,

15:28.080 --> 15:30.150
so he could
fly his mistresses
around the world.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.650
I swore I would
never be that person.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.320
Okay, so are we good?

15:48.290 --> 15:49.359
So, we're good, then?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.900
You don't need
a subpoena for that.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.821
-To pull all those
clients' accounts?
Yeah, I do.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.246
-All those
clients' accounts?
-Hmm.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.319
-You crazy?

16:14.370 --> 16:15.826
You look at this?

16:15.830 --> 16:17.695
Christ! It's like two ounces
of chicken in this thing.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.439
-Well, I gotta
turn over every stone.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.401
Tell them, this is
a guy who once stashed
Russian mob money

16:22.450 --> 16:24.998
in a non-profit
for disabled kids.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.240
-That's not funny.

16:27.830 --> 16:30.742
Look, he can't move
the money that quick.
No one can.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.610
-So, what do you
want me to do, huh?

16:32.660 --> 16:34.036
Help me help you.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.786
-All right, well,
your boy Judge Frankel.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.445
-Nah! I can't go over
Learmont's head like that.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.570
- You do it all the time.
- Yeah, not for you.

16:43.120 --> 16:48.649
Look, there's a reason
that your division is still
over in the old HQ building.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.321
Think about that.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.150
Can I finish my lunch?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.781
-Knock yourself out.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.072
-You pulled out
in front of me, man!

18:01.120 --> 18:03.532
You didn't see me coming?

18:03.580 --> 18:06.697
Why you pull over
like that? No signal.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.241
Just-- just fixed
that bumper, man.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.155
-Mmm-hmm.
Shh, shh, shh.
-Jesus!

18:11.200 --> 18:12.497
-I'm sorry.
-Get the fuck away, man!

18:12.540 --> 18:16.408
-No,no.
Come on. Hey. Come on.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.992
Come on.
It's okay.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.490
You all right?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.651
It's just a car.
It's just a car.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.327
All right? Calm.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.497
I'm all right.
You're all right.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.400
This?
Who cares?

18:32.950 --> 18:36.283
Oh, see this?

18:36.330 --> 18:39.322
It's metal and glass.
That's all it is.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.946
Just metal and glass,
my friend.

18:49.450 --> 18:51.190
Just metal and glass.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.572
That's metal
and that's glass

18:55.660 --> 18:58.322
and that's metal
and that's glass.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.820
-This is where he lives?

19:51.830 --> 19:52.990
-Yo, Elon.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.537
-Who's that?
-He's good.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.241
-I'm good.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.030
-He, uh--
Nick, come here.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.695
Don't fucking
point a gun at me.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.946
-He's good, all right?
He's a friend.

20:25.870 --> 20:28.498
--Let me see it.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.658
-I put everything we need
in that one, second to last.

20:51.370 --> 20:53.497
-How much
are you cashing out?
-All of it.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.939
-Three hundred?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.820
I can't do three hundred.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.070
Busy month.
I'm tapped out.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.286
I got 80.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.649
I can do 80.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.070
That's it.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.076
- Dada!

21:33.120 --> 21:34.109
-Huh?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.280
-Dada!

21:36.330 --> 21:37.786
-Dad have biz.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.149
-Want to make a little tinkle.

21:48.870 --> 21:51.031
-Take your life in your
hands goin' in there.
-Ew!

21:51.120 --> 21:54.328
--Ew, Daddy.
Stinlq. Mom!

21:54.330 --> 21:56.400
-Ah! You're Trapped!

21:56.450 --> 21:59.829
-You are wrong for that.
You know_that line.
No, I just--

21:59.830 --> 22:03.288
-Hey, where's Touie?
-Oh, he said he, uh,
went to go play basketball.

22:03.330 --> 22:04.490
Yeah.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.110
Oh, did you see
the picture that she sent?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.037
She sent it to you,
too, right?

22:18.370 --> 22:21.407
-Here. Some kinda shit,
my nigger. Try this.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.990
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

22:24.830 --> 22:27.492
Feeling like grown-ass man,
aren't you?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.947
Got the tank top on.
You swole, aren't you, huh?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.366
--All right,
I got you there, though.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.156
Pass that right there. Yeah.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.243
Messing with you, boy.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.491
-Put that away.
Put that away. Dad!

22:43.580 --> 22:45.286
-What they do,
Big Ronnie?

22:47.370 --> 22:49.611
-Why you tell
your mom you was going
to play basketball?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.742
-We did. We went
and played basketball early.

22:51.790 --> 22:52.939
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

22:53.950 --> 22:54.939
-Come on. Get.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.571
-Dad, we just hangin'.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.360
-Maybe these ain't the cats
I want you hangin' with.

23:00.410 --> 23:03.072
- Shit, it's all good, big man.
- Stay outta this.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.571
-So you're gonna tell me
who my friends are now?

23:10.660 --> 23:11.786
For real, Pap?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.320
-You okay?

23:40.370 --> 23:41.325
-I'm good.
-Are you okay?

23:41.370 --> 23:42.906
-I'm good.
-Stay down.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.365
-Let's go.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.360
- Touie, call an ambulance!

24:53.080 --> 24:54.149
-Hey, Dave.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.248
-How's the hand, Hulk?
-Eat a dick, Arlo.

25:06.290 --> 25:08.827
-Good morning, sunshine!
-Hey, sugar.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.821
-Agent Rask?
-Hmm.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.690
-Special Agent
Madeline Pierce.

25:18.790 --> 25:19.996
I just transferred
down from DC.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.035
-Pleasure.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.781
-Beautiful city.

25:22.830 --> 25:24.821
-Miami?
-Right.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.655
It's an upgrade for me.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.991
I won‘t miss
the wmters.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.490
-Mmmmmm.

25:30.580 --> 25:33.822
-Well, I, uh, just wanted
to introduce myself.
-Gotcha.

25:33.870 --> 25:36.282
-I'm at your disposal,
so let me know if there's
anything I can do.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.819
-Had a good cafecito, yet?

25:39.910 --> 25:42.117
-I don't know
what that is.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.650
-Oh, really?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.031
Let's go get one.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.991
-Right now?
-Right now.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.156
-Okay, I'll--
I'll get my bag.
-Sure.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.649
-There you go.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.036
-Thanks, Pauly.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.490
-Mmm, wow!

25:56.540 --> 25:57.859
That is strong.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.110
-That's good shit, huh?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.616
Pauly makes
the best stuff
In town.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.446
-See you later.
-Thank you.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.826
-Next.

26:04.870 --> 26:07.282
-So, the Andrew Talman file--

26:07.330 --> 26:08.649
you seen that one?

26:08.660 --> 26:11.151
-Yup. Read that one.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.320
-And, uh, The Sarkisian
Cruise Liner...
-Hmm.

26:13.410 --> 26:15.241
-And The Golden Phoenix
chain with the Triads.

26:15.290 --> 26:16.939
-So, you read
all of them?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.572
- Of_course.
Many times over.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.827
-Well, today is all
about Andrew Talman.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.577
I'm not sure
how it works in D.C.,

26:25.620 --> 26:27.440
but down here
it's a little different.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.741
-I've heard.
-See, this town--

26:29.790 --> 26:32.827
all this _is built
on finanCIal crime,

26:32.870 --> 26:35.191
right up to the top officials.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.400
There are people
who are working very hard
to make sure that

26:37.500 --> 26:40.116
people like you and me
don't get a fair shot
at bringin' them down.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.822
But if they play dirty,
you know,

26:42.830 --> 26:44.991
means we can play
a little dirty, too.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.327
Touie,
you can't go! Touie,
I ain't letting you leave.

27:12.370 --> 27:14.907
Touie, get over here!
Touie, come here!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.865
-Touie, Touie!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold up, son!

27:16.910 --> 27:19.572
-Step off, Pa.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, son. Hold up.

27:19.660 --> 27:20.945
-He's fixin' to get
himself killed.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.786
-You're tryin'
to start some shit?

27:22.830 --> 27:23.945
Huh?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.446
Hey.
-Yeah, Pop, that's what's up!

27:26.500 --> 27:27.865
Oskar hit me up.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.612
Said he got
them OT niggas pinned.
Needs some backup.

27:30.660 --> 27:32.946
-And you wanna
go at it with them?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.444
Is that what's up?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.320
You wanna feel big, huh?

27:36.330 --> 27:38.366
You wanna feel
like a man, huh?
-The killed Jules!

27:38.410 --> 27:40.241
-You wanna feel like
a real man, huh?

27:40.290 --> 27:42.281
Is that what you want? Huh?

27:43.410 --> 27:45.571
I look at you.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.748
I'm lookin', I'm lookin',
I'm lookin'. This ain't
the boy that I raised.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.695
I didn't raise
this boy.
-Yeah?

27:51.750 --> 27:53.695
Some "do what I say
not what I do" bullshit?

27:55.700 --> 27:57.691
-I do what I have to,

27:57.750 --> 27:59.695
'cause that's the way
that shit ended up for us.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.996
But I'm tryin'
to change that.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.326
I'm tryin' to change that
for you, tryin' to change--
-Some bullshit!

28:05.330 --> 28:06.649
What!

28:12.080 --> 28:14.742
-Rona|d!
-Mom!

28:14.790 --> 28:16.997
-Rona|d
-Come here.
Calm down.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.440
-Come here!
-Rona|d. Ronald!

28:21.500 --> 28:23.616
-Come here.
Come here.
-Rona|d!

28:23.660 --> 28:27.539
-Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.743
Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.

28:36.410 --> 28:39.072
I was this close.
You understand me?

28:39.160 --> 28:41.537
This close to losing you today.

28:42.910 --> 28:44.992
You don't know what
that's like as a father.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.787
You can't know
what that's like.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.496
Tomorrow might
not be so lucky.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.446
It might be Elsie.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.070
It might be your mom.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.748
You run around
starting fires with Oskar...

29:07.700 --> 29:09.531
and this whole place
gonna burn.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.320
Touie...

29:20.370 --> 29:21.746
you feel me?

29:23.410 --> 29:24.741
Come here.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.616
Come here.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.326
-Shit.

29:55.370 --> 29:57.691
Don't you have friends
that you can ask or something?

29:57.750 --> 29:59.490
-To what?
Just_ hand over
a pile of cash

29:59.500 --> 30:01.320
by sundown? No.
-Yeah!

30:01.370 --> 30:03.326
-No, I don't know
anyone that would willingly

30:03.370 --> 30:04.997
give me a pile of cash
by sundown.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.905
There is this.
Let me throw this out there.
-Throw it out.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.149
-All right.
It's called smurfing.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.320
It's a structured
money movement.

30:09.370 --> 30:11.656
Now, we need
220 grand by tonight,

30:11.700 --> 30:13.827
but we can't go to a bank
and withdraw that much.

30:13.870 --> 30:18.113
However, we can walk into
a bunch of different banks

30:18.160 --> 30:19.991
and ask for a little bit.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.321
It will have to be less than
$10,000 in each withdrawal,

30:22.410 --> 30:25.072
otherwise they will file
a Currency Transaction
Report with FINCen,

30:25.120 --> 30:26.860
and we can go to jail
for a long time.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.117
But less than ten,
they're not gonna do that.
-No, uh, wait, wait.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.741
No one's going
to notice that?

30:30.790 --> 30:32.781
-Well, if we do
the same bank
different branches,

30:32.830 --> 30:35.902
after a few they could file
a Suspicious Activities Report,
but that would take

30:35.950 --> 30:39.192
weeks to go through
and I think we would--
well, we'd be alive.

30:39.250 --> 30:42.151
-Well, that-- no, no, no, no.
That's a good idea.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.156
I can cover our tracks.
-Yeah?

30:44.200 --> 30:47.078
-Yeah. I'll take the remaining
220, I'll run it through
my foreign shells,

30:47.160 --> 30:49.071
drop it right back
into your personal account,

30:49.160 --> 30:51.993
smurf the shit out of it,
and then weeks from now,
when they come asking for it,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.036
it just looks like me and you
are starting a company together.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.496
-Well, we are.
Aren't we?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.319
All right.
We'll smurf.

31:19.450 --> 31:22.032
-All right, Liebowitz runs
the investment side
with Talman.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.537
I struck out
because the guy is a
40-something straight man.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.821
-So, you think
I'll do better?

31:26.830 --> 31:28.991
- I know
you'll do better.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.328
Look, he doesn't have to do
anything without a subpoena
but the decision is still his,

31:32.330 --> 31:34.821
and I guarantee you
he won't be able
to resist that face.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.071
-This doesn't feel right,
doing it like this.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.156
-Now, I know.
But it's 48 hours at best

31:42.250 --> 31:44.320
until the judge
signs that warrant.

31:44.330 --> 31:48.619
In that time, Talman could have
moved his money three times
and then we are fucked.

31:50.290 --> 31:51.655
-Yeah, you're right.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.036
Okay.
-Hang on.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.865
It'll help.

32:07.330 --> 32:08.695
- Here it goes!

32:26.620 --> 32:27.939
-You gotta be kidding me.

32:31.790 --> 32:33.610
Ma! Ma!

32:33.660 --> 32:35.196
Are you serious?
-Hey, hey, hey!

32:35.250 --> 32:37.241
-What is all that shit?
-This isn't your
garage, mija.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.076
-I have something
time sensitive.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.997
-It's a hundred degrees in here!
-Go inside.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.440
It's okay, Mom.
We'll do it in the yard.
No, no, no.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.697
We got everything
right here, mija.
-Mom, it's fine!

32:46.750 --> 32:49.036
It's fine.
We'll just do it outside.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.650
-Don't worry.
You're not bothering us.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.156
-Yeah, you're bothering me.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.440
Okeechobee, left,
then Miracle Mile.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.819
-Okay, bye.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.827
Dude, I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.650
-Drive a little faster.
Stop drIVIng like
a white person.

34:06.410 --> 34:07.695
-Oh, my God!

34:09.700 --> 34:12.328
-Hack into the traffic lights?
What do you think I have
going on in here?

34:29.160 --> 34:31.401
- It's 72 grand.

34:31.450 --> 34:35.159
-Okay.
That's good.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.747
That's 152.
That's more than half.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.076
- I think we should
go to the police.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.247
-No.
-Yes.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.532
-I promise you it is going
to be better than what he
is going to do to us.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.536
-No. I promise you,
we're not going to the police.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.116
That's more than half.
It's a good gesture.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.037
-A gesture?
-Yes, a gesture.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.822
-Well, so it's like
a fruit basket?

34:54.870 --> 34:56.826
It's like an Edible
Arrangement?

34:56.830 --> 34:58.991
-We have to be
at your dad's soon.
So how about you man up?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.149
-Oh, God.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.651
Oh, God!
This was a bad idea.
Nick, you idiot.

35:04.660 --> 35:07.197
-What's a bad idea?
We're out of time.
It's the best we could do.

35:07.290 --> 35:09.611
-No. All of it, all of it.
I shouldn't have called you.

35:09.660 --> 35:11.321
I should never
have taken that money.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.618
-But you did.
You called me.

35:14.660 --> 35:15.991
You said we would
change the world.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.649
Remember?
Now you're scared?

35:17.700 --> 35:20.692
-Yeah. Can you tell?
Does it show?

35:20.750 --> 35:22.149
-Why am I not surprised?

35:22.200 --> 35:25.283
-I mean, I know we have
the gesture, but still.

35:25.330 --> 35:26.490
-Such a little girl.
It's cool.

35:26.540 --> 35:28.326
All right,
when all this is over,

35:28.370 --> 35:31.533
I'm gonna go my way
and you can go back
to your cushy vanilla life,

35:31.580 --> 35:34.151
where you feel
real comfortable
and not scared.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.656
-I'm scared there, too.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.536
-Hola, Corazon.
-Hey.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.863
- We gotta send a message!
- Let everybody know

36:23.950 --> 36:25.781
from Overtown
to Carol City.

36:25.830 --> 36:30.153
If a nigga think he gonna
fuck with us in our hood,
little Haiti,

36:30.200 --> 36:33.112
we're gonna come
at you ten times bigger.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.493
You kill one of us,
we gonna kill ten of y'all.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.899
You light up a little crib,

36:37.950 --> 36:41.784
we gonna burn down your
damn neighborhood, nigger!

36:41.830 --> 36:44.697
We're gonna cover
the streets of Overtown
In blood!

36:46.540 --> 36:47.609
Yeah!

37:21.250 --> 37:23.320
-Could you point that
elsewhere, please?

37:26.040 --> 37:27.109
You know how
to use that?

37:28.660 --> 37:30.696
-My dad used to take me
shooting out in the swamps.

37:32.660 --> 37:33.786
My little sister, Delfi...

37:34.830 --> 37:36.240
she used to get so jealous.

37:36.290 --> 37:38.906
She said, "Papi,
why can't I shoot, too?"

37:44.330 --> 37:45.536
He'd tell her,

37:45.580 --> 37:47.491
"Corazon. ..

37:47.540 --> 37:49.940
"you're not gonna need
a gun to take care of you.

37:51.790 --> 37:52.825
"You'll have a man.

37:54.450 --> 37:57.499
Izzy, she's gonna need
to take care of herself."

38:00.080 --> 38:01.240
-Oh.
That's messed up.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.069
-That it?

38:50.330 --> 38:51.490
-Okay, that's some of it.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.037
-We're gonna get
the rest tomorrow.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.116
-Ah !

38:57.160 --> 38:58.866
No, you're not.

38:58.910 --> 39:00.537
You ain't gonna do that.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.901
You're gonna
put it back...

39:09.000 --> 39:10.536
in your coin thing.
Put it back.

39:11.830 --> 39:12.990
All of it.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.155
-Are you looking to invest?

39:20.330 --> 39:22.821
-Nah. I want
more than that.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.365
I wanna be your partner.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.611
Sit down.
Sit down.

39:37.620 --> 39:39.941
-Ah, I'm--
I'm confused.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.786
You were just
fixin' to kill us.

39:54.450 --> 39:56.327
-You got me thinking...

39:56.370 --> 39:58.281
with your little speech,
Isabelle.

40:00.450 --> 40:03.829
Some next level shit.
You know?

40:03.830 --> 40:06.822
And for an LH7
like myself...

40:12.870 --> 40:15.942
things been rough for us,
last few years.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.399
Watchin' everybody
else come up.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.782
The Dominicans,
the Ricans,

40:20.830 --> 40:23.287
and the Haitians?

40:23.330 --> 40:25.150
Don't nobody
wanna let us have ours.

40:26.580 --> 40:27.740
But this...

40:31.500 --> 40:33.946
This is where
it's at right here.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.786
What you got
going on, right here.

40:37.830 --> 40:38.819
And, Nick...

40:40.000 --> 40:41.786
I know I was rough with you.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.821
It's how I gotta do sometimes.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.287
You feel me?

40:46.330 --> 40:48.491
_But this _ain't me _
forcmg y'all Into nothIng.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.868
It's just me,
Ronald Dacey,
businessman,

40:53.910 --> 40:56.492
husband,
father of two,

40:56.540 --> 40:58.781
telling both of y'all
I believe in what
y'all doing

40:58.830 --> 41:00.366
and I want
to be a part of it.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.780
Look”.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.499
Nick gave you
laundered drug money
to start your company.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.325
You a smart girl.

41:14.330 --> 41:15.945
Pretty face.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.491
Why not go out there
and ask for the real thing?
-I did.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.610
I asked everyone.
-That's right.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.321
And they all said...

41:24.410 --> 41:25.650
'llNo."

41:26.660 --> 41:28.321
-And why is that?

41:29.790 --> 41:31.655
-Because they're scared.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.867
They're scared what GenCoin
can do to the financial system.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.189
-Boom!

41:38.790 --> 41:40.109
You know who
aIn't scared?

41:41.870 --> 41:43.656
This nigger.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.997
People I know.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.361
Oh, I, uh...

41:48.410 --> 41:50.241
I mean, that sounds
really dangerous.

41:50.330 --> 41:52.696
-These are legit business folks
I'm talkin' about, not just
street thugs.

41:52.750 --> 41:56.652
-No, of course.
-Hey, look, bro.
We in Miami.

41:56.700 --> 42:01.034
Them dudes sittin' up
in them Ivory Towers
on Brickell?

42:01.120 --> 42:03.497
Ain't much difference
between them and
the dudes I know.

42:16.620 --> 42:17.826
I like it.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.326
You do?

42:22.410 --> 42:25.072
-We still need $8 million
to get GenCoin on its feet.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.611
Where else are
we gonna get It?

42:27.660 --> 42:31.152
-Well, you know, I got
a lot of phone calls to make.
I know a lot of people.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.822
- And so does he,
why not give him a shot?
One more thing.

42:33.870 --> 42:37.158
The rest of that money
you got from your old man--

42:37.200 --> 42:39.156
where did that come from?

42:42.290 --> 42:45.498
-Sti|| unclear.
-Right.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.788
So when them folks come looking
for your skinny white ass
same way I did...

42:50.500 --> 42:52.491
you might want
some muscle around you.

42:59.580 --> 43:02.743
- All right now, dirt between
my fingernails, stronger
at my stomach

43:02.790 --> 43:05.247
I'm throwing things.
I'm changing what
is destined

43:05.290 --> 43:09.249
I used to seek affection, fame
and fortune, now I'm begging
for abortions

43:09.290 --> 43:12.748
For the victim, I'll pay
respect, tell me who's gonna
mourn for ya, huh?

43:12.830 --> 43:15.742
I'm holding on for dear life,
excuse me, Jesus Christ

43:15.830 --> 43:18.822
It's obvious I'm helpless,
it took a couple tries

43:18.870 --> 43:22.033
My tears fly dry,
fiddy, cut your mouth

43:22.120 --> 43:25.283
But me no fort, not no funk,
it's my bright side

43:25.330 --> 43:28.288
Threw a punch, go deluxe,
get lunch and roll a blunt

43:28.330 --> 43:31.788
Flip the channel
to the newsman down
at Ferguson

43:31.830 --> 43:34.947
My niggers outraged,
the government's corrupted

43:35.000 --> 43:38.322
So I don't trust a body
riding shiny convict dropper

43:38.370 --> 43:41.578
Bottle of the Hen, now,
off it I'm a hero

43:41.620 --> 43:44.692
Regrets and consequences,
I blame it on the lip, yo

43:44.750 --> 43:47.787
Pointing several fingers,
attack retaliation

43:47.830 --> 43:50.822
My tolerance is zero, dawg,
I had it up to here

43:50.870 --> 43:54.033
Overlook, well prepared,
big kid on training wheels

43:54.080 --> 43:57.197
Flyin' through
the messy things,
tryin' to maintain

43:57.250 --> 44:00.651
Spazzing on the white man,
blaming him for my sins

44:00.700 --> 44:03.942
I'm ignorant and terrified,
but yet I sacrifice, right?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.992
Focus on the victory,
wonder what I'm gonna be

44:07.000 --> 44:10.322
Playing with
my destiny, right

44:10.410 --> 44:13.618
Focus on the victory,
wonder what I'm gonna be

44:13.660 --> 44:16.572
Playing with
my destiny, right

44:18.250 --> 44:19.740
My rally cried to victory

44:19.790 --> 44:21.439
Get off your knees
and on your street

44:21.500 --> 44:24.492
Hit the jade
and toss shit out

44:24.540 --> 44:26.496
But they were wrong
all along

44:26.540 --> 44:29.577
Faking boys making sound,
never catch 'em,
let's get baked
