<i>Laura?</i>

00:51.536 --> 00:53.635
<i>Laura!</i>

00:58.977 --> 01:01.143
<i>Laura, just don't...</i>

01:02.414 --> 01:06.651
- <i>Laura, do you hear me?</i>

01:43.621 --> 01:48.092
<i>You'll beat my ass?
She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!</i>

01:48.192 --> 01:50.862
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass.</i>

01:51.262 --> 01:55.333
- <i>Beat her up!</i>
- <i>Good girl Val's gonna beat my ass.</i>

01:55.433 --> 01:57.902

- Hey. Hey, baby.
- <i>What's up? You okay?</i>

02:25.897 --> 02:30.769
- <i>You sound, like, a little down.</i>
- Oh. No, no, no, no. I'm great.

02:30.869 --> 02:32.734
<i>Okay.</i>

02:35.607 --> 02:38.311
I got something to show you.

02:39.143 --> 02:42.332
<i>I'm excited. Hang on real quick.
I'm gonna pee.</i>

02:43.548 --> 02:47.134
- Mitch.
- <i>Hey. I'm here.</i>

02:48.019 --> 02:50.522
I got something to show you.

02:50.622 --> 02:53.658
- <i>You doing your demon voice again?</i>
- Yeah.

02:53.758 --> 02:56.260
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- You like them?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.096
<i>Yeah. Oh, that's so hot.</i>

02:58.296 --> 03:02.916
It's getting me there. And feet, too.
I love just the top of toes.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.704
What, you... wait.
You don't like them, do you?

03:05.804 --> 03:09.274
No, it's just, you know, there's
other things I wanna see more of.

03:09.374 --> 03:12.143
Yeah, it was worth a shot.
I think I know what you want.

03:12.243 --> 03:15.880
Yeah, let's keep moving up.
There we go. That's closer.

03:15.980 --> 03:17.582
My bruised knees.

03:17.682 --> 03:19.884
- No. No, I don't wanna live there.
- No? That's not it?

03:19.984 --> 03:21.986
I don't wanna live there.
I wanna live higher.

03:22.086 --> 03:25.356
Come on. You're a real estate agent.
Sell this to me.

03:25.924 --> 03:31.536
Well, you are now looking at the outside
of a human's right leg.

03:33.197 --> 03:36.000
You know what? You should just let me
come over and show you how it's done.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.169
No, you can't.

03:38.269 --> 03:40.171
What do you mean, I can't?

03:40.271 --> 03:43.408
No. My dad would kill you.

03:43.508 --> 03:47.809
That's easy. Fine.
That's worth it. I'd die for you.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.817
You're worth it.

03:53.217 --> 03:56.151
I want you to take that shirt off.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.340
Make me.

04:08.733 --> 04:12.070
Take that shirt off before I cut it off.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.805
That's really violent.

04:13.905 --> 04:18.245
Take the shirt off, or I'll cut it off.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.348
Hey, that worked.

04:24.448 --> 04:27.407
That does it for you? All right.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.422
Keep going. Keep going, you're...

04:31.522 --> 04:34.355
Faster. Come on.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.795
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want those hands down there.

04:37.895 --> 04:40.765
No, no, no. Back down.

04:40.865 --> 04:45.291
And I want those panties off,
or you're gonna lose them.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.740
You're adorable.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.908
- And really sexy when you're violent.
- Yeah?

04:58.916 --> 05:00.785
What?

05:00.885 --> 05:02.954
What, Miss Blue Baller?

05:03.054 --> 05:05.189
Hey, girls get them, too.

05:05.289 --> 05:07.458
Don't... I don't wanna hear about
your balls. That's so gross.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.462
- No, you know what I mean. Like...
- I don't know what you mean.

05:10.562 --> 05:13.798
I just have this mental picture
of balls, but no.

05:13.898 --> 05:18.602
Well, I feel like you. I don't want
to experience that anymore.

05:19.302 --> 05:21.338
Which is...

05:22.840 --> 05:24.976
- Why...
- Do you have a little speech planned?

05:25.076 --> 05:26.744
I...

05:26.844 --> 05:29.047
Stop!

05:29.147 --> 05:31.916
- What?
- I wanna make prom night the night.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.245
Yeah?

05:34.752 --> 05:36.820
You're serious?

05:37.755 --> 05:40.855
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- No.

05:41.325 --> 05:44.028
You wouldn't lie to me? You're serious?

05:44.128 --> 05:48.865
- No, I'm not lying to you.
- That's great. That is...

05:50.134 --> 05:52.904
That's finally the reaction
I was looking for.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.506
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

05:55.606 --> 05:59.277
Your boobies!
Your, your, your, your boobies!

05:59.377 --> 06:04.916
Yeah. Let's keep this show going.
I wanna see what I'm getting.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.382
Prom night. I got something
to look forward to.

06:07.985 --> 06:08.853
Hey, we'll call him back.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.888
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.722
- It's just getting good.
- Get the knife.

06:15.193 --> 06:17.128
Get the knife, baby.

06:17.228 --> 06:19.163
Let's see the whole show.

06:19.263 --> 06:21.332
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, shit!

06:21.432 --> 06:23.334
What's going on?

06:23.434 --> 06:25.870
- Someone's in their chonies!
- What did we walk in on?

06:25.970 --> 06:29.073
- A little cybersex!
- Someone's in their chonies!

06:29.173 --> 06:32.209
Blaire, you're a dirty girl.
You're going to hell now.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.045
- What?
- What are you guys doing?

06:34.145 --> 06:36.848
- Going to hell with the rest of us.
- Nothing. What's up?

06:36.948 --> 06:38.449
- Hey, guys.
- Where are you coming from, man?

06:38.549 --> 06:42.052
Hey, Mitch. Why do you have
such a big boner, bro?

06:42.754 --> 06:44.889
- What are you talking about?
- I totally missed it.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.724
- Shut up.
- Hey, Blaire.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.560
- Hey, Ken. How are you?
- Blaire, your blouse, babe.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.062
What?

06:51.162 --> 06:53.097
What are you calling
my girlfriend "babe" for?

06:53.197 --> 06:55.233
Hey, Mitch, who's your buddy?

06:55.333 --> 06:58.168
- What?
- Who's your buddy?

06:59.403 --> 07:02.540
- That's not with us.
- What kind of sex were you guys having?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.742
- I thought you guys brought that in.
- Ken, we were not having sex.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.577
- No, wasn't us.
- Were you having a three-way?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.946
No. What? Who is that?

07:09.546 --> 07:11.983
- I just tried to hang up on him.
- Cyber three-way!

07:12.083 --> 07:13.384
- Ken?
- Yeah?

07:13.484 --> 07:15.386
I tried to hang up on this thing.
It wouldn't let me.

07:15.486 --> 07:19.257
- You take turns?
- Honestly, he is not in with us.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.292
That came with you guys.

07:21.392 --> 07:24.359
- It's not working.
- All right.

07:25.463 --> 07:27.265
All right.

07:27.365 --> 07:30.469
- What do you mean?
- Let's just call each other back. Yeah?

07:32.736 --> 07:34.959
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:28.953 --> 09:31.422
Hi!

09:31.522 --> 09:33.257
- Hi!
- Why is this fucker still here?

09:33.357 --> 09:35.759
What, Mitch's boner?

09:37.028 --> 09:42.433
- What is this person's problem?
- Guys, guys, it's definitely a hacker.

09:42.533 --> 09:45.069
He's spying to get info on farts
and boners, okay?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.737
Is that what today's agenda is?

09:46.837 --> 09:52.540
Well, we haven't hit the farts yet,
but thanks to the Ken's famous salsa,

09:53.010 --> 09:54.879
the gas will be rolling tonight, baby.

09:54.979 --> 09:57.782
- Guys, hey. All right, stop.
- You're so gross.

09:57.882 --> 10:00.349
Can we get rid of this person?

10:02.320 --> 10:07.224
How about I call Blaire back,
and then we'll go from there.

10:07.324 --> 10:09.290
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.599
What's up?

12:39.699 --> 12:41.709
It's still there.

12:42.146 --> 12:45.883
- So, were you guys really cybering?
- No.

12:45.983 --> 12:48.486
Is that, like, a thing you do?

12:48.886 --> 12:50.488
It's...

12:50.588 --> 12:52.356
- It's really cute.
- It's still here.

12:52.456 --> 12:54.922
You guys are so cute.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.995
- Hey, guys.
- Heyo!

13:02.733 --> 13:04.971
It's still here.

13:05.936 --> 13:07.571
Whatever, fuck it.

13:07.671 --> 13:10.474
- It's just probably a glitch.
- How do we know that?

13:10.574 --> 13:12.710
Yeah, I can't call the number
or anything like that...

13:12.810 --> 13:17.581
Shit! Three stars, motherfuckers!
Suck on that!

13:17.681 --> 13:20.217
Yo, so I talked to Kyle about Friday.

13:20.317 --> 13:23.653
And I got the weed,
but he's out of molly. So...

13:53.450 --> 13:55.283
What?

18:16.179 --> 18:20.741
Blaire, come back!
Blaire! Where'd you go?

18:21.385 --> 18:24.922
- Stop looking at porn!
- Shut up, for, like, a second.

18:25.022 --> 18:30.591
- Are you talking to boys?
- Hey, I'm writing an email. Stop.

18:30.828 --> 18:33.429
...from the horse's mouth.

19:23.346 --> 19:24.982
Guys, did you talk to Val tonight?

19:25.082 --> 19:27.771
Dude, when we were at Adam's party,
she was telling people

19:27.871 --> 19:30.254
- I had a drinking problem.
- You do.

19:30.354 --> 19:33.856
- I'm gonna add her.
- Can I just be honest? I don't like Val.

19:34.157 --> 19:36.493
- Nobody likes Val.
- Can I just be honest? I don't like her.

19:36.593 --> 19:42.038
- The only person that likes Val is Val.
- Is Val. Yeah. You just get me, Jess.

19:43.634 --> 19:44.935
Hi, Val.

19:45.035 --> 19:47.871
- Hey, Val.
- Hey, Val.

19:47.971 --> 19:52.340
Val. Turn up the sound, you dumb bitch.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.745
Val!

19:54.845 --> 19:57.848
- Can you hear me now, Ken?
- Yeah, there you are, you floozy.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.384
Hi, yeah. You know,
when you talk and it's muted,

20:00.484 --> 20:04.779
I can still hear you on your end.
So I don't appreciate "dumb bitch."

20:05.355 --> 20:10.093
Okay. Did you guys buy your tickets,
like, two weeks ago like I asked you?

20:10.193 --> 20:14.197
- No, you said you were gonna get 'em.
- No, you didn't. No, I told you to buy them.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.534
So now I'm hearing that you guys
are gonna be seated in the balcony,

20:17.634 --> 20:19.636
and three of us are gonna have
to sit in the orchestra.

20:19.736 --> 20:21.939
So, maybe you should have bought
your tickets sooner like I told you.

20:22.039 --> 20:24.074
- All right. What? I don't care.
- That's too bad.

20:24.174 --> 20:28.211
- I wish you bought your ticket earlier.
- Which seats are better, balcony or orchestra?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.913
- Balcony.
- Balcony.

20:30.013 --> 20:31.181
- I'll take orchestra.
- Okay, you're in balcony.

20:31.281 --> 20:33.417
I can take one more in balcony.

20:33.517 --> 20:36.753
- I'll take it in the orchestra.
- I'm sure you will.

20:36.853 --> 20:38.689
Jess.

20:39.189 --> 20:41.858
- Oh, my God!
- You're the only one that got that.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.164
- Val.
- What?

20:47.264 --> 20:49.132
- Wait. What?
- Looking good.

20:49.232 --> 20:51.201
Thank you.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.103
- No.
- I got a haircut, like, two days ago.

20:53.203 --> 20:57.240
No. I mean, you look good right now, too,
but check your Facebook.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.139
What?

21:02.045 --> 21:03.914
These are intense. Hold on.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.816
- Did you give Jess permission?
- Jess! What the shit?

21:05.916 --> 21:08.151
- Dude!
- Why would you post that?

21:08.251 --> 21:09.853
This is the first time I'm seeing these.

21:09.953 --> 21:12.089
- These are incredible.
- Oh, my God. It just came from your account.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.457
- I've never seen these before.
- Jess!

21:13.557 --> 21:16.059
These are amazing.
Val, I didn't know you were so much fun.

21:16.159 --> 21:20.831
Oh, my God! A bong? Okay, seriously,
I'm friends with my mom on here.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.132
- All right.
- Come on!

21:22.232 --> 21:24.868
- Should I look at these? Is this worth a look?
- What the hell! Delete these!

21:24.968 --> 21:27.371
- Jess, take these off. They're not good.
- Dude, I didn't...

21:27.471 --> 21:30.541
- Delete them, Jess.
- I didn't do this, okay?

21:30.641 --> 21:34.411
- I don't know why you're getting so pissed.
- You trashy little bitch. Delete them.

21:34.511 --> 21:37.347
Wait. Wait, did you just call me trashy?

21:37.447 --> 21:38.882
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, Jess.

21:38.982 --> 21:41.818
So, you're asking me for a fucking favor,
to take down these photos

21:41.918 --> 21:45.722
- that I didn't post in the first place...
- I'm asking for a favor? I'm asking for...

21:45.822 --> 21:47.257
- You posted them.
- Yeah, I didn't fucking do it, okay?

21:47.357 --> 21:52.729
So you can be nice to me and I can
help you or you can suck my fucking dick...

21:52.829 --> 21:55.533
- ...fucking party.
- ...and piss off.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.301
Close your trashy little mouth for,
like, one second and listen to me.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.338
I will beat your ass any goddamn day
if you come over here.

22:01.438 --> 22:04.741
- I'm so sure. I'm so sure.
- Listen, we are not ghetto.

22:04.841 --> 22:06.866
- No. Okay, how about this? Mitch...
- Blaire, really?

22:06.966 --> 22:10.580
- Do you want me to fucking delete them or not?
- Yes! Delete them now.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.584
I'll come pick you girls up and we can go
fight outside of a Wendy's or something...

22:13.684 --> 22:15.786
- Ken, not helping.
- Ken. Stop, you're not helping.

22:15.886 --> 22:19.323
We can go to a Taco Bell parking lot
and you guys can slap-fight it out.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.725
- I'll pick both of you up.
- Thank you, Jess.

22:21.825 --> 22:23.793
You wish.

22:24.227 --> 22:26.964
I am so wet right now.

22:27.064 --> 22:29.333
- They're still here, Jess.
- It's, like, not working.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.502
Why are you so quick to assume that
I posted these when I'm telling you...

22:32.602 --> 22:35.673
- Who else would have?
- I've never fucking seen these photos before.

22:35.773 --> 22:38.809
Oh, my God! Shut up.

22:39.109 --> 22:43.013
I try to hit delete, and it disappears.
I reload the page, it's still there.

22:43.113 --> 22:47.084
I hit delete. I'm trying. I'm fucking
trying to help you. Okay, Val?

22:47.184 --> 22:50.817
You have a headache, Ken?
You have a headache?

22:51.421 --> 22:55.292
- Okay, it looks like it's working.
- Thank you.

22:56.092 --> 22:57.361
Okay.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.996
Unbelievable that you would think
that would be fine.

23:00.096 --> 23:02.162
Okay, they're gone.

23:03.734 --> 23:05.736
- No, they're not.
- No. Adam po...

23:05.836 --> 23:08.705
- You owe me a thank you.
- Adam! What the shit!

23:08.805 --> 23:11.274
- What?
- You posted some now, too?

23:11.374 --> 23:15.412
- Did you just copy and paste them?
- No. I didn't fucking post anything.

23:15.512 --> 23:17.414
You guys need to stop.

23:18.114 --> 23:20.584
- I'm a bitch, Jess?
- Chill out, Val.

23:20.684 --> 23:23.686
Don't... you're doing
your nails right now.

23:23.786 --> 23:27.324
- You're so innocent. I'm a bitch? Really?
- Anger issues much?

23:27.424 --> 23:30.160
Dude, I'm not even fucking typing.
I don't know what to say.

23:30.260 --> 23:34.598
- What is happening right now?
- What the fuck? I've dated, like, two guys.

23:34.698 --> 23:36.700
- I didn't type that.
- Fuck you, okay?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.069
- I didn't type that.
- Bullshit.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.904
Hey... somebody let me know
when it's fucking over.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.473
I love that you think I'm a fucking slut,
and your ass is drunk...

23:43.573 --> 23:46.640
- I didn't type that!
- Girls, stop.

23:47.143 --> 23:48.378
- Please.
- Okay, yeah, Blaire.

23:48.478 --> 23:53.283
- Just take Jess' side. Of course.
- I love you girls so much. Let's be...

23:53.383 --> 23:56.019
- Blaire, you're just gonna take Jess' side?
- No, I'm not on Jess' side.

23:56.119 --> 23:59.556
- You just typed that.
- I don't think she should've put these... What?

23:59.656 --> 24:03.591
- No, I didn't type anything!
- If you didn't type it, then who did?

24:09.132 --> 24:11.234
Well, who the fuck is Billie?

24:11.334 --> 24:14.404
- I told you I didn't post those photos, Val.
- Guys, who is this?

24:14.504 --> 24:15.639
- I don't know.
- He was here the whole time?

24:15.739 --> 24:18.408
Ken, you said it was just a glitch.

24:18.508 --> 24:21.476
Well, the glitch just typed!

24:29.719 --> 24:30.721
Brucer.

24:30.821 --> 24:32.723
Dude, I bet this guy's
been here the whole time.

24:32.823 --> 24:36.059
I do not know a Billie,
but he apparently hates Val.

24:36.159 --> 24:38.992
This is Laura's account.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.597
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

24:45.402 --> 24:46.603
Not Laura Barns?

24:46.703 --> 24:50.763
Yes, I'm still friends with her on here.
I never, like, deleted it.

24:55.512 --> 24:57.474
Seriously?

24:59.482 --> 25:02.143
Who is doing this?

25:04.321 --> 25:07.355
Maybe it's Laura.

25:08.858 --> 25:10.093
Ken.

25:10.193 --> 25:12.559
Who hacks a dead girl?

25:12.829 --> 25:16.799
- Maybe it's her brother or something.
- Why would he do that, Jess?

25:16.899 --> 25:18.799
He was a weirdo.

25:18.899 --> 25:21.266
Not that weird!

25:42.993 --> 25:45.929
It's probably just,
like, a troll or something.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.697
What is a troll?

25:47.797 --> 25:51.401
An Internet troll? Like, someone
that just harasses people online.

25:51.501 --> 25:54.334
They just wanna get reactions
out of people.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.909
Can we hang up on him?

25:59.009 --> 26:02.679
- No, I can't. I can't hang up on him.
- If we can't... Fine, I'll take care of him.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.282
Hi, Billie, listen, sweetheart.

26:05.382 --> 26:08.084
You're a fucking asshole, and if you
don't take these down right now,

26:08.184 --> 26:11.652
I'll come over there and knock
the trash out of your ears!

26:15.859 --> 26:18.271
Who the fuck is this guy?

26:26.803 --> 26:28.204
Okay.

26:28.304 --> 26:31.408
All right, let's stop fucking around.
Everyone, hands up, right now.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.276
Who's doing this?

26:33.376 --> 26:35.977
- Not me.
- Adam, here we go.

26:46.389 --> 26:50.157
I told you it wasn't me,
that's all I can say.

26:51.461 --> 26:55.131
- All right, let's hang up on him.
- There's, like, no... there's no button.

26:55.231 --> 26:57.167
- There is no button.
- What do you mean?

26:57.267 --> 26:59.533
There's no button to hang up on him.

27:06.576 --> 27:09.316
Guys, he's, like, sending me something.

27:13.283 --> 27:16.553
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

27:16.653 --> 27:19.489
This is fucked up, do you hear me?

27:19.589 --> 27:21.024
- Val, what is it?
- Brucer, shut up!

27:21.124 --> 27:24.327
- Calm down, Val.
- No, I can't calm down, this is messed up!

27:24.427 --> 27:28.298
Val, I told you not to snapchat
your boobs.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.634
Oh, really?

27:31.334 --> 27:33.837
Really? That's a threat.
Yeah, you know what?

27:33.937 --> 27:37.204
Yes, asshole, good news,
I'm calling the cops.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.507
Congratulations, dipshit.

27:41.611 --> 27:44.581
- I'm calling.
- Val, you don't need to call the cops.

27:44.681 --> 27:46.549
- Just calm down.
- Yes, I do. I do need to call the cops.

27:46.649 --> 27:50.083
Okay? It's a threat. Hi. Hi.

27:50.853 --> 27:53.289
Listen, my name
is Valerie Rommel, I'm online

27:53.389 --> 27:56.725
and there's some asshole
making direct threats against me.

27:57.327 --> 28:00.230
- Brucer! Yeah. Hold...
- Yep.

28:00.330 --> 28:03.366
Ken, I swear to God, if I find out
this is you, I will burn you alive.

28:03.466 --> 28:05.899
- You understand me?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

28:06.202 --> 28:10.373
Thanks for stopping by, Val.
Real nice lady, real nice chick.

28:10.473 --> 28:12.840
She said she was gonna
burn me alive, dude.

28:14.511 --> 28:16.246
- This isn't you, Jess?
- Jess, it's not you?

28:16.346 --> 28:20.216
- No way. Not worth my time.
- She can't do a powerpoint presentation...

28:20.316 --> 28:24.120
It's more... more than likely,
it's some girl that she's pissed off,

28:24.220 --> 28:26.823
and she's getting fucking scared,
and she fucking deserves it.

28:26.923 --> 28:27.872
I'm sorry. She takes a shit...

28:27.972 --> 28:31.127
Should we take screen grabs
of the stuff that he was saying?

28:31.227 --> 28:34.164
It's "Billie" with an I-E.
It's definitely a girl.

28:34.264 --> 28:37.434
- It's kind of threatening, right?
- He's been listening this whole time.

28:37.534 --> 28:40.504
- It's not letting me take a screen grab.
- Yeah, me neither.

28:41.204 --> 28:43.173
- Let's just get out of here.
- Let's just hang up.

28:43.273 --> 28:46.142
All right. I'll see you guys
tomorrow. Hey!

28:46.242 --> 28:48.622
- Come over, Adam, and we'll go see...
- Kyle?

28:48.722 --> 28:51.514
- We'll go across the tracks.
- All right, I'm down.

28:51.614 --> 28:54.581
- Wait.
- What?

28:55.118 --> 28:58.852
- I just got an email from him.
- What is it?

28:59.222 --> 29:00.957
- This is Laura's email.
- What'd they say?

29:01.057 --> 29:04.094
- It's a link.
- It's just a stupid troll, dude.

29:04.194 --> 29:07.063
Obvious troll is obvious.

29:08.298 --> 29:10.901
Just send it to Ken
so he can find out who it is.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.335
Just forward it to me.

29:12.435 --> 29:15.969
Let Ken, like, try to find
the IP address or something.

29:16.806 --> 29:20.376
Okay, either I'm going crazy,
or there's no forwarding button.

29:20.476 --> 29:22.278
It's at the bottom,
if you click on, like, "reply all."

29:22.378 --> 29:24.226
- No, I know where it is, baby, but...
- You in Gmail?

29:24.326 --> 29:25.849
Yeah.

29:25.949 --> 29:28.351
Oh, my God, Blaire, do you know
how to use a fucking computer?

29:28.451 --> 29:32.220
- Fucking open it!
- Share me your screen.

29:33.589 --> 29:38.161
Jesus. Just forward the shit on to Ken
so we don't have to deal with this again.

29:38.261 --> 29:40.463
- My God.
- Adam.

29:40.563 --> 29:42.332
See, look.

29:42.432 --> 29:46.161
It literally doesn't exist. There's no
"forward" button. Do you see it?

29:47.273 --> 29:49.082
No.

29:49.853 --> 29:53.695
Dude, weird computer shit
happens to me all the time.

30:02.518 --> 30:05.185
Click the fucking link, dude!

30:13.896 --> 30:16.332
- Yikes.
- Oh, Val.

30:16.432 --> 30:19.454
Val, you're fucking sick!

30:20.837 --> 30:23.907
In Val's defense, her comment wasn't
completely unwarranted, okay?

30:24.007 --> 30:27.243
Nobody wants to talk about it,
but I'll give you the Ken-pinion.

30:27.343 --> 30:28.978
Laura fucking sucked.

30:29.078 --> 30:34.214
She was a big bully, okay, and she deserved
all the shit she got from that video.

30:34.717 --> 30:38.685
Ken, dude. Come on.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.192
- Ken.
- What?

30:42.292 --> 30:45.625
Sorry. I'm sorry,
that was in poor taste.

33:36.466 --> 33:41.263
"They should lock you up."
"You monster"?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.848
What the...

33:56.319 --> 34:01.035
Okay, you're a fucking creeper.
What do you want?

34:06.963 --> 34:09.599
Val, what'd the cops say?

34:09.899 --> 34:12.933
- What is it?
- I think it's frozen.

34:17.106 --> 34:20.447
Hey, Val, you stupid bitch,
say something.

34:21.010 --> 34:23.371
Did you guys hear her call?

34:34.456 --> 34:36.489
I'm calling her.

34:38.460 --> 34:42.496
Guys, look at her mirror.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.502
- Do you guys see the mirror?
- The mirror's fucked up. Yeah.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.969
What's going on over there?

34:48.971 --> 34:51.860
- Val!
- Val?

34:52.275 --> 34:55.777
Dude, maybe she's doing this shit.
Like, for attention.

34:55.878 --> 34:57.112
- Blaire, is it going through?
- You think of that?

34:57.213 --> 35:01.251
Yeah, I... Look, look at it!
It's right there.

35:01.951 --> 35:05.221
- She's not...
- Holy shit.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.420
Wait...

35:19.735 --> 35:21.304
- What was that?
- Holy shit.

35:21.404 --> 35:23.472
- Shit.
- Val?

35:24.573 --> 35:26.339
What?

35:27.643 --> 35:30.480
- Val!
- What the hell?

35:30.580 --> 35:34.147
What just happened?
Did she close the computer? Did it drop?

35:43.025 --> 35:44.394
- Anyone home?
- Hello?

35:44.494 --> 35:46.596
- Hello?
- Hello?

35:46.696 --> 35:48.965
- Hello?
- Hey.

35:49.065 --> 35:53.570
Fresno County sheriff's office.
Somebody called 911?

36:00.543 --> 36:02.111
- Hello?
- Can they hear us?

36:02.211 --> 36:04.714
Hello, hey! Down at the computer!

36:04.814 --> 36:06.382
- Hello?
- Hello?

36:06.482 --> 36:07.850
- Hey!
- Dispatch, we got a...

36:07.950 --> 36:11.020
- Hello? Hello, can you hear us?
- Wait, what'd they say?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.323
10-35?

36:13.723 --> 36:15.658
- I heard 10-25.
- Which one?

36:15.758 --> 36:18.127
- 10-30.
- 10-25.

36:18.227 --> 36:20.961
- What is that?
- 10-35...

36:22.798 --> 36:25.758
- No, it's a time check, so...
- That's insane.

36:26.902 --> 36:29.038
5250?

36:29.138 --> 36:32.180
5250? I didn't hear 5250.

36:32.908 --> 36:35.678
No, it's a mental...

36:36.178 --> 36:39.182
- No shit.
- Val used to have seizures!

36:39.282 --> 36:41.217
- Yeah, we'll start around the...
- Guys, she...

36:41.317 --> 36:44.487
- Are you sure? I don't remember.
- Yeah, she told me, like, a long time ago.

36:44.587 --> 36:46.989
She had this sickness
that causes seizures.

36:47.089 --> 36:51.060
- Maybe she just had a frickin' seizure.
- Have you ever seen her have a seizure?

36:51.160 --> 36:54.897
- Jesus. This is a 10-55.
- No, dude, they said 10-55.

36:54.997 --> 36:58.652
- 10-55?
- 10-55?

36:59.368 --> 37:01.539
10-55...

37:01.639 --> 37:06.576
10-55 is suicide.
Did they really just say 10-55?

37:06.676 --> 37:08.678
- Val?
- Oh, my God.

37:08.778 --> 37:11.248
- Hello? Hello?
- Shit.

37:12.048 --> 37:13.082
Okay. All right, I'm calling.

37:13.182 --> 37:16.216
- Does anyone know her parents' number?
- I'll try to get her back, okay?

37:34.470 --> 37:36.654
Nobody accept.

37:37.139 --> 37:39.126
No one accept it.

38:14.276 --> 38:16.042
What...

38:20.816 --> 38:22.824
Who are you?

38:31.694 --> 38:33.796
What did he send you guys?

38:33.896 --> 38:35.595
What?

38:43.205 --> 38:45.817
I can't fucking shut it off.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.981
- We gotta get him out.
- Who cares? We have to go over and help Val.

38:52.081 --> 38:54.550
- We can do this shit after.
- Wait, hold on. The cops are with Val.

38:54.650 --> 38:58.387
- We're doing this shit after.
- What's the point?

38:58.487 --> 39:01.854
What are you guys gonna do
that the cops can't do?

39:03.059 --> 39:05.565
Fuck this! We're not doing this here.
Everyone, just fucking stop.

39:05.665 --> 39:08.497
- Pick up your phone, mute your computers.
- I don't know where my phone is, guys.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.433
- Seriously, please don't do this.
- Hold on, Jess...

39:18.474 --> 39:20.507
Fuck, guys.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.119
Guys?

39:30.219 --> 39:32.422
- Whatever he's doing, it can wait, okay?
- ...Val's in five minutes.

39:32.522 --> 39:36.125
Guys, I can hear you. He can hear you.
He can turn your mics on.

39:36.225 --> 39:38.360
Guys, can you just
fucking trust me, okay?

39:38.460 --> 39:41.363
Install this program
and I'll find out who it is.

39:41.463 --> 39:45.134
Who cares, dude? Val's in fucking
trouble. You just saw her.

39:45.234 --> 39:47.403
Ken can get him out, okay?
We need to stop this guy.

39:47.503 --> 39:50.840
- Billie, just let us leave, okay?
- You guys wanna know who this is or not?

39:50.940 --> 39:53.476
Yeah, we're ready to play, Billie.

39:53.576 --> 39:56.064
- Jess, we're gonna play a game.
- I don't know what's happening!

39:56.164 --> 39:59.015
We're gonna play a game, okay?
You wanna play the game.

39:59.115 --> 40:01.317
You wanna play the game.
Jess, you wanna play the game.

40:01.417 --> 40:03.253
Okay.

40:03.753 --> 40:05.187
- Okay, is it fixed?
- What is it?

40:05.287 --> 40:08.621
It's just a game. We're just all
gonna download it and play it, right?

40:10.693 --> 40:13.760
I'm not doing anything, man.
I just wanted to play a game.

40:14.764 --> 40:17.467
You like games. You seem to like games.
Dude, I thought we were gonna play.

40:17.567 --> 40:20.002
All right. I have a fucking
great game for you, man.

40:20.102 --> 40:22.735
- Okay, you guys got it?
- Yeah.

40:23.305 --> 40:25.539
Okay. I just launched it.

40:29.245 --> 40:31.781
I got something for you, Billie.

40:31.881 --> 40:33.382
Fucking shit.

40:33.482 --> 40:35.618
Okay, okay, okay. Is it searching, guys?

40:35.718 --> 40:38.788
- Did everybody download it?
- Mine's got something. Mine's got something.

40:38.888 --> 40:42.189
Okay, good. Wait till everybody
got something.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.531
Is it flagging? Has everybody got some flags?
It should be more than one, too.

40:46.631 --> 40:48.045
- It should be multiple.
- Yeah.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.011
- Okay, cool.
- Yes.

40:50.111 --> 40:53.803
Hit "trash." Trash all of those and then
empty your recycling bins, okay?

40:53.903 --> 40:56.939
Yeah, empty your recycling bin
after you trash it. Do not save them.

40:57.039 --> 40:59.677
Everything. Everything that's flagged.

41:02.378 --> 41:05.982
- It's not gonna delete these.
- Just fucking listen to me. Trust me, dude.

41:06.082 --> 41:08.250
- Shit. Shit.
- Okay.

41:08.350 --> 41:11.453
Is it deleted? What's going on?
Keep me updated, guys.

41:11.553 --> 41:14.757
- Okay. Okay, Adam's is done. Mitch?
- Mine's the same.

41:14.857 --> 41:16.325
- Okay, Jess?
- Mine's done.

41:16.425 --> 41:18.457
Okay, Blaire?

41:18.961 --> 41:21.463
- Blaire? Blaire!
- Shit.

41:21.563 --> 41:25.201
There's a lot in my recycling bin.
I don't know how to make it go faster.

41:25.301 --> 41:27.503
- What?
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

41:27.603 --> 41:29.038
Adam, don't make him mad.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.540
- Adam, you are overreacting.
- He's got...

41:31.640 --> 41:33.008
- It's gonna be fine. We just need...
- Just stop.

41:33.108 --> 41:37.021
We're just waiting on Blaire's bin, guys.
Everything is gonna be cool, I promise.

41:37.121 --> 41:39.682
- Blaire...
- There's a pinwheel, I don't...

41:39.782 --> 41:43.185
- Why is he counting down?
- Don't worry about it. Just get it done.

41:43.285 --> 41:46.388
- Okay. It's cool, Blaire.
- It's done! Everything's... it's done.

41:46.488 --> 41:48.591
- It's done? It's gone?
- Yes.

41:48.691 --> 41:49.792
Thank God.

41:49.892 --> 41:51.794
- Is it gone?
- Is he out?

41:51.894 --> 41:54.363
Yeah. Yeah.

41:54.463 --> 41:56.899
Fuck you, Billie. Suck on that, bitch!

41:56.999 --> 41:59.268
Thank you, Ken.

41:59.368 --> 42:01.804
Adam, you pulled out a fucking gun!

42:01.904 --> 42:04.140
Dude, what the hell was that?

42:04.240 --> 42:06.242
- Did you load that thing?
- Yeah, man.

42:06.342 --> 42:09.511
You were flinging it around!
It's going to go off.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.712
I can't believe it. What were you
gonna do, shoot through the computer?

42:12.812 --> 42:18.053
- Guys! Guys, I saved your life.
- We just... Val used to get seizures.

42:18.153 --> 42:20.322
- We should call the cops.
- That's the only thing I can think of.

42:20.422 --> 42:21.890
Okay.

42:21.990 --> 42:24.724
I had a conversation on my computer...

43:16.378 --> 43:18.247
<i>911, please state your emergency.</i>

43:18.347 --> 43:23.385
Yeah, hi, there's someone
threatening me and my friends online,

43:23.485 --> 43:26.388
and they also threatened
our friend, Valerie Rommel.

43:26.488 --> 43:28.958
You sent some officers over there
earlier to her house,

43:29.058 --> 43:33.362
but they didn't see what we saw,
and there's a lot more to the story. So...

43:33.462 --> 43:35.931
<i>What is your friend's address?</i>

43:36.031 --> 43:37.967
- What?
- <i>Her address.</i>

43:38.067 --> 43:40.735
Guys? Guys, what's her address?

43:40.835 --> 43:44.571
- Hold on, I have it in my desk. Hold on.
- One sec.

43:46.442 --> 43:49.812
10705 East Bauer.

43:49.912 --> 43:52.314
Yeah, it's 10705 East Bauer.

43:52.414 --> 43:55.151
And he keeps threatening us,
and he won't leave us alone, and...

43:55.251 --> 43:57.686
<i>Where are you right now, sir?</i>

43:57.786 --> 44:01.256
I'm at home. Online, with my friends.

44:01.356 --> 44:04.226
- <i>Are you safe?</i>
- Yeah.

44:04.326 --> 44:06.392
<i>All of you?</i>

44:07.696 --> 44:09.064
Yeah, we're good.

44:09.164 --> 44:11.998
- <i>Even Ken?</i>
- What?

44:13.468 --> 44:16.072
- <i>Don't hang up.</i>
- What?

44:16.172 --> 44:18.204
But what just happened?

44:23.679 --> 44:27.326
<i>I said, "don't hang up."</i>

44:27.716 --> 44:29.818
Who did you call?

44:29.918 --> 44:33.552
Fuck! It's this fucking asshole!

44:48.737 --> 44:51.528
Hey, genius, we can see you!

44:54.743 --> 44:57.276
Hey! Hey, buddy!

45:02.751 --> 45:03.986
You know what?

45:04.086 --> 45:07.289
What is that?
It's behind, like, a lattice?

45:07.389 --> 45:11.749
- Like, a crate or something? Like...
- It's not letting me hang up.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.309
Wait, Ken! Ken!

45:21.837 --> 45:24.540
- What?
- Wait, come back.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.539
What?

45:28.844 --> 45:30.679
Back up a little bit.

45:30.779 --> 45:33.546
- Why?
- Just do it, dude.

46:33.675 --> 46:36.509
Ken, what the fuck's going on?

47:14.516 --> 47:16.182
Ken.

47:23.192 --> 47:25.694
- What the fuck?
- Ken? Ken?

47:25.794 --> 47:28.127
- Don't kill me!
- Ken!

47:29.264 --> 47:32.067
Is he okay? Ken!

47:33.302 --> 47:37.506
- Oh, my God! Ken! Ken...
- Ken, come on! Ken, stop fucking around!

47:37.606 --> 47:40.275
Oh, my God! No! Don't...

47:40.375 --> 47:42.010
- Guys...
- Holy shit!

47:42.110 --> 47:46.212
- What was he doing?
- What the fuck just happened? Ken?

47:46.848 --> 47:48.117
Shut up, Jess! Just shut up!

47:48.217 --> 47:50.520
- What the fuck?
- Shut up, Jess! Fuck!

47:50.620 --> 47:52.654
- This is so fucked up!
- This isn't funny anymore!

47:52.754 --> 47:57.025
Fuck this shit! Okay?
I'm fucking out of here! You hear me?

47:59.094 --> 48:00.960
Fuck.

48:15.043 --> 48:16.806
Fuck.

48:17.646 --> 48:19.815
Hey, babe, go lock your door.
Go lock your door.

48:19.915 --> 48:23.104
What? I think it is locked.

48:28.123 --> 48:29.956
Hello?

48:31.726 --> 48:33.428
Hello?

48:33.528 --> 48:35.494
Oh, fuck.

48:40.835 --> 48:43.638
What do you see? Adam?

48:43.738 --> 48:45.474
Adam, what do you see?

48:45.574 --> 48:47.352
Guys...

48:54.816 --> 48:57.719
There's fucking no one here.

48:57.819 --> 49:00.222
I'm gonna go check it out.

49:00.322 --> 49:02.391
- No, no, no. Don't. Don't.
- No, don't do it.

49:02.491 --> 49:05.258
- No, Adam, no!
- What?

49:07.195 --> 49:09.262
What the...

49:12.033 --> 49:13.335
- Is it locked?
- Lock the door.

49:13.435 --> 49:15.834
- Lock your door.
- Yeah, I fucking...

49:16.538 --> 49:20.011
Who's there? Hey!

49:22.878 --> 49:25.171
Who's here?

49:26.381 --> 49:29.561
I have a fucking gun! You hear me?

49:31.486 --> 49:34.987
Fuck. What the fuck?

49:45.800 --> 49:48.834
What do you want?

49:55.777 --> 49:57.973
What video?

49:58.947 --> 50:01.383
- <i>What the fuck?</i>
- <i>You better slap that ho!</i>

50:01.483 --> 50:05.387
- <i>Yeah, whore, I will beat your ass.</i>
- <i>You'll beat my ass?</i>

50:05.487 --> 50:07.723
<i>She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!</i>

50:08.623 --> 50:12.093
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass!
Val is gonna beat my ass!</i>

51:13.655 --> 51:15.457
- No, this isn't on us, man.
- This isn't our fault.

51:15.557 --> 51:17.623
This is not on us.

52:45.814 --> 52:48.413
- What?
- What?

52:50.285 --> 52:53.021
No. No, fuck this. I'm not...

52:53.121 --> 52:56.181
I'm not fucking playing any fucking...

52:57.592 --> 53:00.322
- Adam! Adam, stop!
- What? What?

53:12.173 --> 53:14.408
Like the drinking game?

53:20.248 --> 53:22.951
What? Wait, how do you play?
How do you play?

53:23.051 --> 53:25.650
I'm not playing your fucking games.

53:26.888 --> 53:30.058
Why don't you fucking explain it.
It's your fucking game, man!

53:30.158 --> 53:32.561
Somebody just tell me how to play!
Guys... Jess, how do you...

53:32.661 --> 53:36.131
Dude... okay, you put up five fingers,
and then if you've done something,

53:36.231 --> 53:38.844
you have to put your finger down.

53:42.904 --> 53:44.937
That's how it works.

53:51.045 --> 53:54.124
This is the dumbest fucking thing.

53:54.583 --> 53:57.285
What... Why are you... why?

53:57.385 --> 53:59.718
I'm gonna lose.

54:00.889 --> 54:03.655
- Are we doing this?
- I don't wanna play.

54:07.396 --> 54:10.198
Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!

54:10.298 --> 54:13.766
Just fucking do it.
Fine, all right, five fingers up, fine.

54:20.742 --> 54:24.010
- Who did that?
- Wasn't fucking me.

54:25.246 --> 54:28.013
Okay, fuck, it was me, okay?

54:28.750 --> 54:31.920
- You said it was Val.
- Okay, I lied, all right?

54:32.020 --> 54:33.488
You...

54:33.588 --> 54:35.924
It's not like there's not
some kind of truth in there!

54:36.024 --> 54:38.310
- What are you doing?
- Dude, it's not my fault!

54:38.410 --> 54:40.929
You're the one who's like,
"I'm not hungry, I already ate."

54:41.029 --> 54:43.295
- All that shit.
- Do not do this right now.

54:49.037 --> 54:52.540
- It wasn't fucking me.
- It was one of you guys?

54:52.640 --> 54:54.516
Jess, stop it!
Don't attack people right now.

54:54.616 --> 54:56.278
I'm sorry, it was me, okay?

54:56.378 --> 54:58.780
We were drunk, and it happened,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

54:58.880 --> 55:03.184
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm sorry, Jess.

55:03.284 --> 55:05.787
- Great friend, Blaire.
- I have apologized.

55:05.887 --> 55:09.424
She's not apologized for starting
this rumor thing about me.

55:09.524 --> 55:12.988
- That is not true, by the way.
- Hey! We're keeping together on this.

55:13.088 --> 55:14.364
Stop it.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.233
That was me. Easy.

55:22.170 --> 55:25.106
It was last year. She kissed me.
I threw her off. Nothing happened.

55:25.206 --> 55:27.272
It's fine.

55:30.479 --> 55:34.549
What? No, no, please tell me
he's lying, Jess, you fucking bitch!

55:34.649 --> 55:37.454
- Fuck you. It wasn't me, okay?
- Shut up. Shut up! It was me, man.

55:37.554 --> 55:39.252
- It was me. I'm sorry.
- It was you?

55:39.352 --> 55:41.059
- Yeah.
- What? Why?

55:41.159 --> 55:42.858
What do you mean, "What? Why?"
Does it really fucking matter?

55:42.958 --> 55:46.160
Yeah, it does to me, Mitch!
They put me in fucking handcuffs, man!

55:46.260 --> 55:50.398
I almost had a record! My fucking dad
almost disowned me for that!

55:50.498 --> 55:54.135
It was gonna be both of us or one of us,
and I would do the same shit for you.

55:54.235 --> 55:55.470
- So let me take the rap?
- Hey, it doesn't matter!

55:55.570 --> 55:59.183
- It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
- Oh, my fucking hero, Mitch.

55:59.283 --> 56:01.174
- Knock it off!
- My hero!

56:04.245 --> 56:08.349
- Fuck. You guys are fucked up, man!
- Like you don't have enough fucking money.

56:08.449 --> 56:11.052
- Keep it, bitch!
- Fucking asshole.

56:11.152 --> 56:16.505
Yeah, let's listen to Blaire again, 'cause
that keeps working out so fucking well.

56:32.440 --> 56:34.272
What?

56:34.475 --> 56:36.790
Guys, are you serious?

56:37.712 --> 56:40.568
None of us did that.
We wouldn't do that.

56:41.482 --> 56:43.818
- Blaire?
- What?

56:43.918 --> 56:47.188
- Blaire, did you do that?
- No!

56:47.288 --> 56:51.860
- How do we know?
- Hey! It's not her. It's not her.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.728
- I... we wouldn't do that.
- Put down a finger and we'll see.

56:53.828 --> 56:56.779
- She already said it. Stop pushing her!
- Yeah, I heard her say that!

56:56.879 --> 56:59.467
- She always tells the truth, Mitch?
- Yeah! Yeah.

56:59.567 --> 57:02.837
Oh, she does?
She always tells the truth, right?

57:02.937 --> 57:06.107
'Cause you always
tell the truth, right, Blaire?

57:06.207 --> 57:09.074
You always tell the truth.

57:16.818 --> 57:18.920
Fine, it was me.

57:19.020 --> 57:20.722
- Adam, Jesus!
- You piece of shit!

57:20.822 --> 57:22.941
You're a fucking piece of shit.
You know that?

57:23.041 --> 57:25.160
Fuck you! You're a piece of shit!

57:25.260 --> 57:26.894
- I'm just nothing to you, Adam.
- You piece of shit.

57:26.994 --> 57:30.832
Fuck you! He said if I traded you
that the three of us could live.

57:30.932 --> 57:33.801
- I was trying to save your life, Mitch.
- No! No!

57:41.609 --> 57:44.880
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you, Adam!

57:44.980 --> 57:48.817
'Cause you guys are all so
fucking perfect, right? Yeah?

57:48.917 --> 57:52.406
- Wait. Guys, guys, guys. Come on, please.
- Okay. All right. I see.

57:52.506 --> 57:54.189
- You know what? Fuck this.
- Guys, come on.

57:54.289 --> 57:59.147
I got an idea. Hey, Billie,
why don't you lay off? I got this one.

57:59.947 --> 58:02.697
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Easy one.

58:02.797 --> 58:06.565
Never have I ever had sex.

58:07.569 --> 58:11.205
- Hey, Billie, can we get a timer, please?
- What are you doing right now?

58:11.705 --> 58:15.977
There goes my finger. Hey, Jess,
you only need to put down one, not 50.

58:16.077 --> 58:19.148
- Fuck you, Adam.
- Okay.

58:20.048 --> 58:22.784
Hey, that's weird.
The timer's still going.

58:22.884 --> 58:26.187
- Billie, why's the timer still going?
- What are you doing?

58:26.287 --> 58:27.856
- What are you doing, Adam?
- Tick-tock...

58:27.956 --> 58:30.224
- The round ain't over.
- What are you doing?

58:30.324 --> 58:32.895
Someone hasn't answered.

58:32.995 --> 58:35.563
- Hello?
- What are you...

58:35.663 --> 58:37.665
I'm sorry.

58:37.765 --> 58:40.769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

58:40.869 --> 58:43.471
- I'm sorry, Mitch.
- What do you mean?

58:43.571 --> 58:46.007
- Okay, new question.
- I'm sorry...

58:46.107 --> 58:48.643
Never have I ever...

58:48.743 --> 58:53.014
- fucked my boyfriend's best friend.
- What are you doing, Adam?

58:53.114 --> 58:55.183
- There. You happy, Blaire?
- Why are you doing this?

58:55.283 --> 58:58.420
- What are you doing? Is he serious?
- Mitchie, I'm so sorry. Don't...

58:58.520 --> 59:01.289
- Are you serious? He's telling the truth?
- God damn it, Adam!

59:01.389 --> 59:04.122
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- It was an accident. It was an accident!

59:04.222 --> 59:07.262
- I didn't mean to do that.
- It was an accident? Oh, my God!

59:07.362 --> 59:10.265
- I was drunk, okay? It just...
- Oh, my God. What were you doing?

59:10.365 --> 59:14.269
- I'm sorry, it just... I hate you, Adam!
- How? How? I don't get it. How?

59:14.369 --> 59:18.473
- Fuck you, Blaire.
- Stop talking, Adam! Stop it!

59:18.573 --> 59:20.909
It doesn't matter, remember, Mitch?

59:21.009 --> 59:24.746
- It doesn't fucking matter, right?
- It does matter. It does matter, because...

59:24.846 --> 59:29.016
We might all fucking die, but we're
better than you, you piece of shit!

59:30.451 --> 59:33.614
Guys, stop. Guys, please stop.

59:43.598 --> 59:46.799
- Any other guy I liked treated me like shit.
- I'm gonna fucking win this thing.

59:46.899 --> 59:49.313
I'm gonna win this thing.
Never... never have I ever...

59:49.413 --> 59:52.841
Everyone's hands up! We're still playing!
We're still playing here!

59:52.941 --> 59:56.775
Never have I ever roofied Ashley Dane!

59:57.078 --> 59:59.547
- Fuck you, man! Okay?
- Guys, what are we doing?

59:59.647 --> 01:00:02.317
- Look at that! Finger's down!
- We were drunk. She's a fucking liar.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:05.686
- That's how you wanna play? All right. Fine.
- Guys, come on. Please, let's stop!

01:00:05.786 --> 01:00:08.523
Don't talk to me. I don't wanna hear
from you, slut. Fucking slut.

01:00:08.623 --> 01:00:13.094
- Don't call me that. Do not call me that.
- How many guys? How many guys?

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:16.597
No more, I swear! Do you think
I'm a slut? Are you kidding me?

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.732
You swear? Like you swore you love me?

01:00:20.768 --> 01:00:23.938
No! Mitchie, I love you!

01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:25.706
Perfect fucking Blaire.

01:00:25.806 --> 01:00:28.342
You don't even know!
It only lasted, like, a second!

01:00:28.442 --> 01:00:31.079
- Fuck you, Blaire!
- Right, Adam?

01:00:31.179 --> 01:00:33.314
Why would you tell me that?
That doesn't make shit better.

01:00:33.414 --> 01:00:36.751
I'm sorry. I don't know
what else to say. I'm sorry.

01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:37.952
- Mitch, I...
- Fucking...

01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:42.524
Never... never have I ever forced
Ashley Dane to get an abortion!

01:00:42.624 --> 01:00:47.495
- Stop doing this, guys. I'm sorry, okay?
- Oh, it's four! It's four!

01:00:47.595 --> 01:00:51.332
- What are you...
- Don't fucking do this, man.

01:00:51.432 --> 01:00:54.603
Fuck you! You fucking took my girl,
and you took her for yourself.

01:00:54.703 --> 01:00:57.906
- No, he didn't. I'm still...
- It wasn't like that. It wasn't like that!

01:00:58.006 --> 01:01:02.273
- It wasn't? It wasn't like that?
- No, it wasn't! It fucking wasn't!

01:01:07.949 --> 01:01:12.520
Why is this happening?
Why are you showing this?

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.590
Mitchie, don't watch!
Just don't watch, okay?

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:19.127
Don't read into her shit, okay?
Don't watch.

01:01:19.227 --> 01:01:24.246
It didn't... Baby, it didn't mean anything.
I love you. Stop watching.

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:27.668
Look at me, Mitch. Mitch, look at me!

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:31.172
I didn't mean it. Guys?

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:33.475
We were drunk, Mitch, okay?
It was my birthday.

01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:37.629
I sent you a fucking card,
you piece of shit.

01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:43.818
- No!
- No! Bullshit. Fuck you!

01:01:43.918 --> 01:01:48.723
I'm ready for you, motherfucker!
You hear me? I'm fucking ready for you!

01:01:48.823 --> 01:01:53.061
Come on over! Now!
I'll fucking kill you!

01:01:53.761 --> 01:01:55.729
I'm gonna...

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.430
Fuck.

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.452
It's my printer.

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:13.147
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What? What, Adam?

01:02:13.247 --> 01:02:14.815
- What is it?
- What is it?

01:02:14.915 --> 01:02:16.485
- Fuck.
- What is it?

01:02:16.585 --> 01:02:19.253
It says I'm not supposed
to tell you what it says.

01:02:19.353 --> 01:02:22.957
Come on, Adam. Don't do this to us.
Don't do this to us!

01:02:23.057 --> 01:02:25.290
Please don't do this to us!

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.562
What's it say?

01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:31.065
Tell us right now, you piece of shit.
You fucked my girl.

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:34.736
- I fucking told you I loved you. Fuck...
- Mitch. You're never gonna find out, okay?

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:39.226
So get your narrow fucking head
around that, you hear me?

01:02:44.979 --> 01:02:47.248
What's it say?

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:50.615
- What is it?
- I can't.

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.054
I can't.

01:02:53.154 --> 01:02:54.927
I can't.

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:58.545
You can't? Adam and Blaire
with another secret.

01:02:58.645 --> 01:03:01.362
- No, no, no. No. It's not like that.
- It's not like that. You don't understand.

01:03:01.462 --> 01:03:03.664
- I'm fucking finished. I'm signing off.
- Mitch, it's not like that, baby.

01:03:03.764 --> 01:03:05.733
No, no, no! She'll kill you!

01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:07.368
- She'll kill you. Stop it!
- You're gonna kill me?

01:03:07.468 --> 01:03:10.271
If you're gonna kill me,
you better fucking kill me right now!

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:13.739
No! Stop, baby. Stop, okay?
Just calm down.

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:17.445
Just... just calm down, okay?
Everybody just calm down.

01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:19.814
Okay? Everybody just...

01:03:19.914 --> 01:03:23.870
Baby? It's okay. It's... I'm sorry.

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.821
- I can't tell you.
- Look at me. Look at me.

01:03:26.921 --> 01:03:30.424
You have one minute. Say what you want.

01:03:30.524 --> 01:03:32.193
What?

01:03:32.293 --> 01:03:37.062
Okay, okay, okay. It... it just...

01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:41.669
We met up one more time to see
if it was a fluke or something more.

01:03:41.769 --> 01:03:43.804
- Where was this?
- It was at my house.

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:47.909
- You shut up! Where? When?
- Let me talk to him. Just let me talk to him.

01:03:48.009 --> 01:03:52.480
It was in September right before
we went back to school, okay?

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.315
We just...

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:58.820
We started to do it, but then we stopped
because it was really clear, okay?

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.788
- It didn't... It didn't...
- She's not lying, man.

01:04:00.888 --> 01:04:02.557
Shut up! Shut up!

01:04:02.657 --> 01:04:05.527
Did he touch you again?
Did he touch you again down there?

01:04:06.227 --> 01:04:10.807
- Just for a second. Just for a second.
- She's not lying, Mitch. She's not, okay?

01:04:10.907 --> 01:04:13.000
Now show me the paper.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.304
- You don't want me to show you the paper.
- No, I do, Blaire. Show me the paper.

01:04:16.404 --> 01:04:18.472
- No, Mitch, why are you doing this?
- No more fucking secrets.

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:21.809
Blaire, I'm not fucking around.
Show me the paper. Or I walk!

01:04:21.909 --> 01:04:23.671
- I walk! That's it, Blaire.
- No, no, no! Please don't leave me!

01:04:23.771 --> 01:04:26.547
- Show me the paper...
- You gotta understand...

01:04:26.647 --> 01:04:30.218
I'm not fucking around, here!
Show me that paper!

01:04:30.318 --> 01:04:35.022
- Sit the fuck... Get back here, Mitch!
- What are you... No, no, no!

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:37.758
Oh, my God!

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.093
No! No! No! No!

01:04:45.099 --> 01:04:47.296
Adam!

01:04:50.037 --> 01:04:52.848
You stupid bitch!

01:04:52.948 --> 01:04:56.010
- I'm sorry, Jess.
- You killed him.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.188
I didn't know what to do.

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:08.222
<i>Hello. Can I share a secret with you?</i>

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:11.792
<i>It's just three words. Free live cams.</i>

01:05:11.892 --> 01:05:13.795
<i>Free live cams are the absolute best.</i>

01:05:13.895 --> 01:05:18.065
<i>Having beautiful women all over the Internet
just waiting to fulfill your every desire.</i>

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:21.869
- <i>There's simply nothing better than that.</i>
- I'm not gonna just sit here, guys.

01:05:21.969 --> 01:05:24.272
Adam... Adam was right, okay?

01:05:24.772 --> 01:05:28.873
We can't listen to her.
I'm gonna make this right, guys, okay?

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.311
- I didn't do anything.
- Jess, just do not answer, do not give in!

01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:35.650
What?

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:40.134
Don't answer.
Whatever you do, do not answer.

01:05:42.056 --> 01:05:45.093
Oh, my God! Jess? Jess, just run.

01:05:45.193 --> 01:05:48.028
Just hide, Jess.
Just hide in your bathroom.

01:05:48.128 --> 01:05:50.009
I'm gonna get you help!

01:05:59.206 --> 01:06:00.505
God.

01:06:05.279 --> 01:06:08.949
Yes! Okay. Hi! Guys, listen, look at me!

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.185
Hey, look at me. Hi, hi.

Hi. Hi.

01:06:41.849 --> 01:06:43.825

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:46.368
Hi, can you hear me?

01:06:47.021 --> 01:06:51.158
Hi. Hi. My name is Blaire Lily,

01:07:16.317 --> 01:07:18.449
Stop being pricks!

01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:21.452
Oh, God!

01:07:24.892 --> 01:07:27.828
- Hello?

01:07:27.928 --> 01:07:29.630
- Are you okay?
- I... listen, I...

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.165
There's something happening.

01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:34.268
My friend is being attacked.
She needs your help.

01:07:34.368 --> 01:07:36.437
- How can I help? Can I help you?
- Yes, yes.

01:07:36.537 --> 01:07:40.474
Can you call the Fresno,
California police and tell them that...

01:07:40.574 --> 01:07:43.744
My name is Blaire Lily.
Look, here's her address.

01:07:43.844 --> 01:07:47.311
- Look, look. Here's her address...
- Okay, one second.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.847

Okay, one minute.

01:07:52.186 --> 01:07:55.323

- Hi, there's this girl, and she's online,

01:07:55.423 --> 01:07:59.894
and she says that there's someone
attacking her. She's in Fresno, California.

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:04.365
- Who's attacking you?
- Who? I don't know.

01:08:04.465 --> 01:08:06.067
- There's something in my house...
- She's just yelling a lot.

01:08:06.167 --> 01:08:07.668
...and we're being attacked.

01:08:07.768 --> 01:08:10.171
She says there's something in her house
and she's being attacked,

01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:13.552
and it's her boyfriend
and all of her friends.

01:08:15.876 --> 01:08:18.712
- Just tell them to come to that address.
- You know who's attacking you?

01:08:18.812 --> 01:08:22.584
Okay. She says just come to the address.
Wait, what is it again?

01:08:23.584 --> 01:08:26.620
- What's the address?
- Yes... I'm sending it to you right now.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.799
Sorry, one minute.

01:08:31.258 --> 01:08:33.709

Okay. So the address
is 4478 Winslow Avenue.

01:08:39.966 --> 01:08:44.202
- And she said it was in Fresno, California.
- Tell them to get here! Are they coming?

01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:48.175
- Are you...
- They're going to send a car.

01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:52.488
- They are? They are? Thank you!
- Okay. Okay, great.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:56.984
- Yeah, they said they're five minutes away.

Okay, Jess. There's a car coming.
The cops are coming.

01:09:00.287 --> 01:09:01.756
They're going to be there in 5 minutes.

01:09:01.856 --> 01:09:04.689
- Why are they taking so much...
- The cops are coming.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.662

01:09:08.763 --> 01:09:11.432
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jess?

01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:16.067
Jess! Jess! Just run.
Jess, just run, okay? Just...

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:30.548
Jess!

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:41.895
No. Jess? Jess?

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.035
No! No! Oh, my God!

01:09:54.174 --> 01:09:55.907
What?

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:08.385
I'm so...

01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:16.961
Oh, my God!

01:10:21.335 --> 01:10:23.168
Mitch?

01:10:25.706 --> 01:10:27.672
Oh, my God.

01:10:31.245 --> 01:10:33.513
Oh, my God!

01:10:41.355 --> 01:10:43.621
What are you doing?

01:11:11.214 --> 01:11:13.051
Mitchie.

01:11:18.592 --> 01:11:20.658
Do you see...

01:11:33.641 --> 01:11:36.643
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:43.648
What is that?

01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:48.789
It's an alarm I set for tomorrow.
We have a test.

01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:52.156
- We do?
- Yeah, it's...

01:11:52.926 --> 01:11:55.633
Mitch, do you hate me?

01:11:57.231 --> 01:11:59.142
- I don't hate you, Blaire.
- You don't?

01:11:59.242 --> 01:12:01.001
No, I don't hate you.
I love you so much.

01:12:01.101 --> 01:12:02.704
I love you.

01:12:09.276 --> 01:12:12.379
- That wasn't us, Laura!
- Laura, please.

01:12:12.479 --> 01:12:15.749
It was not us, I promise you.
It wasn't us.

01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:17.715
It wasn't us.

01:12:20.554 --> 01:12:23.615
Please, Laura. It wasn't us!

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:31.348
- I'm scared.
- Laura, I promise you.

01:13:30.624 --> 01:13:31.817
Mitch!

01:13:38.265 --> 01:13:42.000
Why did you do... Mitch? Mitch?

01:13:43.403 --> 01:13:46.000
Mitch!

01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:49.877
What?

01:13:49.977 --> 01:13:53.102
Guys, I'm so sorry! Why did you do that?

01:13:53.202 --> 01:13:56.247
Why did... what... who was...

01:14:00.921 --> 01:14:02.753
What?

01:14:03.256 --> 01:14:05.122
What?

01:14:11.965 --> 01:14:15.869
No, no, no. Why are you
still counting down?

01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:18.168
Why are you...

01:14:18.605 --> 01:14:20.941
What do you want from me?

01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:24.149
What do you think I did?

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:35.692
We were sisters, Laura.
Don't you know it? I loved you.

01:14:35.792 --> 01:14:37.655
Look.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:43.127
Look at us. No, look at us.
Look! Look at us.

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:47.465
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

01:14:52.272 --> 01:14:55.277
I'm so sorry we drifted apart.

01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:03.848
What?

01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:18.196
No!

01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:46.793
<i>I got her.</i>

01:15:46.893 --> 01:15:48.926
I'm sorry.

01:16:32.172 --> 01:16:33.971
No!

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:36.741
Laura?
