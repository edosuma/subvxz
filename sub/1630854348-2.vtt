WEBVTT

00:11.458 --> 00:12.375
Graveyards,

00:12.875 --> 00:14.041
cemeteries,

00:14.125 --> 00:15.541
the ultimate collection.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.958
Layers of earth separate ancient burials,

00:19.458 --> 00:21.416
both pagan and holy.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.083
A witch,

00:23.166 --> 00:24.333
a warlock,

00:24.416 --> 00:25.500
a saint.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.916
And the soil is full of secrets

00:28.416 --> 00:29.291
and treasure.

00:31.083 --> 00:36.583
For the vermin that chews
indifferently on wood or bone,

00:36.666 --> 00:38.250
it means nourishment.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.791
And for the humankind, bounty.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.666
Our tale today is "The Graveyard Rats,"

00:45.750 --> 00:48.916
and its director is Vincenzo Natali.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.541
Oh!

02:05.625 --> 02:06.750
She's a beaut.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.416
Sure is.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.500
A lady
of refined disposition, I'd hazard.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.833
By the looks of her, even in this state,

02:18.416 --> 02:20.333
I'd say she was a pretty one.

02:29.041 --> 02:32.750
Hey, but you'd never get
a class act like this one

02:32.833 --> 02:34.000
while she's breathin'.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.541
-Me, I take what I can get.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.000
As do I.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.333
The bag, if you will.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.541
The name's Masson.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.041
I am the steward
of this garden of remembrance

02:59.125 --> 03:01.750
from which you've so brazenly thieved.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.166
-Nothing to say for yourselves?
-Have a heart.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.458
-We're stupid and don't know no better.
-Yeah.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.708
Permit me to enlighten you.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.375
Are you aware
that the very foundations of society

03:14.458 --> 03:17.208
are built on the respectful interment
of the dead?

03:17.791 --> 03:20.916
We stopped being apes
when we dug our first graves.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.583
It was the birth of civilization.

03:24.791 --> 03:29.041
And it will be its end when we cease
to honor those that came before.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.000
Now,

03:33.500 --> 03:34.416
off with you.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.708
You ain't gonna hand us over
to the local const--

03:43.875 --> 03:45.458
Pathetic.

03:55.791 --> 03:57.458
Let's take a look at you.

03:58.791 --> 04:00.333
Here we go.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.583
Oh, yes. Yes!

04:06.916 --> 04:07.916
Here we go.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.083
Ooh.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.000
Oh.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.458
Foundations of society indeed.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.041
Agh.

04:28.625 --> 04:29.583
All right.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.041
-Oh, come--

04:38.125 --> 04:39.166
-Ow!

04:39.250 --> 04:40.500
-Oh!

04:40.583 --> 04:42.166
Oh! Oh.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.333
Oh, you! Yah!

05:08.958 --> 05:09.833
Good morn.

05:11.875 --> 05:12.916
Over here.

05:15.541 --> 05:16.708
Yeah, keep going.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.166
Well?

05:25.916 --> 05:28.125
-That's it?
-What do you mean?

05:28.208 --> 05:30.750
There's more than enough
to satisfy this month's installment.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.958
There ain't enough here
to cover the interest.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.916
Ah, that locket is sterling silver.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.375
It's pewter.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.500
Silver.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.500
Pewter.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.541
This is the third time you come up short.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.541
I'd give you the benefit of the doubt,

05:53.041 --> 05:56.083
but my employers
take a less charitable view.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.041
They're beginning to think

05:58.875 --> 06:01.458
maybe you're keeping
the best for yourself.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.083
You offend my honor, sir.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.041
The Massons have
always been good for their debts.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.500
I'm merely the victim
of misfortune at the card table,

06:08.583 --> 06:10.416
and I have every intention of repaying it.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.166
The problem's the rats.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.041
-The rats?
-Yes, the rats.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.500
They… They've infested my cemetery.
The beasts steal the bodies

06:17.583 --> 06:20.083
before I have a chance
to extract my stock-in-trade.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.708
Why, often is the time
that after digging for hours

06:22.791 --> 06:25.333
in the dampness and cold
of a miserable night, I reach my prize

06:25.416 --> 06:27.916
only to discover
that it's merely a… an empty box!

06:28.000 --> 06:32.083
So you's telling me
rats is stealing bodies out of coffins.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.583
What'd I just say? It's an epidemic.

06:34.666 --> 06:37.458
My... My monthly returns
are a fraction of what they once were.

06:37.541 --> 06:40.083
Ah, well… rats can't do that.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.416
Oh, my dear fellow,
they most certainly can.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.625
And Salem's rats are no ordinary rodents.

06:44.708 --> 06:48.666
No, they come from far-off lands.
Have done for hundreds of years.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.541
As long as the port has existed,

06:50.625 --> 06:55.916
stowaways on trading ships returning
from Malaysia, China, the Ivory Coast,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.458
and other exotic lands
where these creatures' ubiquitousness

06:58.541 --> 07:00.375
have inspired entire religions.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.500
I am, if nothing, a student of history.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.916
And it is well known that in the old days,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.166
when Cotton Mather
hunted Salem’s evil cultists,

07:11.250 --> 07:14.875
there existed a network of caverns
beneath these fair streets.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.875
Black churches

07:17.583 --> 07:20.250
that hosted ghastly orgies

07:20.333 --> 07:24.041
and... and perverted sacraments
to unspeakable entities.

07:24.125 --> 07:27.333
God in Heaven only knows
what’s… what's breeding down there.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.666
They're rats.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.291
-Just kill 'em.

07:31.791 --> 07:35.791
I have employed both guile
and brute force to destroy these pests.

07:36.458 --> 07:39.708
Traps, poison, even gas.
Nothing has stopped them.

07:39.791 --> 07:42.625
Their warrens are complex
and… and… and well fortified.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.833
Not to mention I’m a claustrophobe.
Small spaces are unbearable.

07:45.916 --> 07:48.000
The result of a childhood incident
in an ice box.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.458
It's not your concern.
My point is that I’m unable

07:50.541 --> 07:53.000
to penetrate the enclosures
where they congregate.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.041
And all the while the brutes get bolder.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.208
I mean, this…
this is the result of a rat bite

07:57.291 --> 08:00.541
I suffered while attempting to acquire
the items you have in your possession.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.333
The pain, let me tell you, was unbearable,

08:02.416 --> 08:05.500
but it was nothing compared
to what I endured from my physician

08:05.583 --> 08:08.583
in the form of countless needles
to inoculate me against disease.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.333
As you can see, I'm at my wits' end,

08:10.416 --> 08:13.208
and I beg you and your employer
to please, <i>please,</i>

08:13.291 --> 08:14.958
show me just a modicum of mercy,

08:15.041 --> 08:17.625
or at least patience
as I contend with these issues.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.791
You's already used up my patience,

08:22.875 --> 08:25.958
standing here, listening to you's yammer.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.833
As for my employers,

08:30.166 --> 08:32.666
they'll give you one week,

08:32.750 --> 08:34.875
so if I was you, Mr. Masson,

08:35.458 --> 08:36.708
I'd pay what you owe.

08:38.166 --> 08:39.000
Otherwise,

08:40.458 --> 08:43.125
you won't be
in the cemetery business anymore.

08:44.125 --> 08:46.333
You will <i>be </i>the business.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.625
Keep the pewter.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.250
Go away.

09:25.125 --> 09:25.958
Dooley!

09:27.166 --> 09:28.000
Dooley!

09:28.916 --> 09:29.750
Gah.

09:35.125 --> 09:38.041
-Is he in?
-I told you never to come here.

09:38.125 --> 09:38.958
Well, is he?

09:39.458 --> 09:42.958
No, thank goodness,
out attending to some business,

09:43.041 --> 09:45.291
but he might be back any time,
so make it quick.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.625
I need to know
if you've got anything promising.

09:47.708 --> 09:50.875
Nothing this week. Nothing of consequence.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.625
-Could I have a look?
-Absolutely not.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.458
You don't understand,
this is a matter of life or death.

09:56.541 --> 09:58.166
I only deal in the latter,

09:58.250 --> 10:01.666
and in this case,
there are only paupers and vagrants.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.125
No one of particular value.

10:04.208 --> 10:08.125
Perhaps there is an unfortunate soul
who, like myself, knew better times

10:08.208 --> 10:11.666
and procured gold fillings
before a fall from grace.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.333
-It would only take me a minute to check.
-No.

10:15.416 --> 10:16.875
Come, Dooley,

10:17.583 --> 10:18.583
dear fellow.

10:19.208 --> 10:23.041
How many times
have I… assisted you in the past?

10:23.541 --> 10:25.250
Not to mention lined your pockets,

10:25.333 --> 10:27.500
more than was bargained for,
I might add.

10:28.583 --> 10:33.750
Only one thing can convince me
to let you examine those cadavers.

10:34.541 --> 10:35.666
Oh, Dooley.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.125
I expected more.

10:38.916 --> 10:40.041
The Devil's Elixir.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.625
If only you could muster
the will to abstain.

10:43.708 --> 10:47.416
So many find their end
in its dark pleasures.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.458
I pray you don't one day
count yourself among them.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.041
Having said that,

10:53.625 --> 10:55.000
I did come prepared.

11:13.541 --> 11:14.541
Here we go.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.791
We're still looking for the head.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.166
Found in a bath.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.916
It was like soup.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.166
-Ugh.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.416
Looks like the old gal
still took good care of her teeth though.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.666
Wooden dentures.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.458
Some fine workmanship there.

11:56.541 --> 12:00.750
-Sadly underrated on the open market.
-Oh, damn it all to hell!

12:01.291 --> 12:02.208
I told you.

12:02.291 --> 12:05.583
All they left to the world
was their mortal remains.

12:05.666 --> 12:08.583
-What's that? What's in there?
-Nothing of value to you.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.458
Come on. You've had your look. Let's go.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.041
All right.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.666
Leave that one alone. It just came in.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.416
The coroner hasn't had a chance
to examine it.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.833
-Oh, hallelujah!
-Are you out of your mind?

12:26.916 --> 12:27.916
He's important.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.916
-Wealthy shipping merchant.
-Yup.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.125
One scratch on him
and the coroner will know.

12:32.208 --> 12:35.833
Then he'll start asking questions,
and do you know how soon it'll be

12:35.916 --> 12:38.625
before he figures out
the particulars of our arrangement?

12:38.708 --> 12:42.083
-I need those teeth.
-Wait until tomorrow, and I'll let you--

12:42.166 --> 12:43.958
Tomorrow could be too late.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.875
Once he's in the ground,
the rats'll get him.

12:48.291 --> 12:49.291
This way, madam.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.208
Oh!

13:03.291 --> 13:04.333
Oh, Lord.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.083
Oh!

13:07.125 --> 13:10.458
Dear… Dear Winston.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.791
There, there, Mother.

13:13.541 --> 13:14.708
Forgive me, but he…

13:15.416 --> 13:17.291
he seems almost alive.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.666
As if he were
having his afternoon respite.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.875
Do as you must,
but please preserve his appearance.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.833
For the presentation,
I would have him dressed in his finest.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.583
All of his medals
will be affixed to his breast, and…

13:35.458 --> 13:36.666
in his hand

13:37.291 --> 13:40.375
will be the saber
gifted to him by King George,

13:41.500 --> 13:43.166
his most prized possession.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.250
Are you sure, Mother?

13:46.333 --> 13:49.625
It's priceless.
Once interred, it is lost to you forever.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.958
Shame, child.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.416
Your father would have it no other way.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.166
No cost is too great
for this final tribute.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.250
A most pleasant evening to you, madame.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.458
And sir.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.041
Fuck off.

14:42.541 --> 14:45.208
"Long is the way and hard,

14:46.541 --> 14:48.500
that out of Hell leads up to light."

14:49.750 --> 14:51.833
Truer words were never written.

14:55.958 --> 14:58.958
He'll only be in the ground
for a few hours before I reach him.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.625
Surely those… pests
can't get to him that quickly.

15:06.916 --> 15:07.833
Oh, Lord.

15:09.916 --> 15:10.791
Please…

15:11.875 --> 15:13.000
show me mercy.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.666
If only this one time.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.208
No! No! Oh, God!

16:08.833 --> 16:09.750
Huh!

16:49.166 --> 16:50.708
-Hmm?

16:55.458 --> 16:57.333
"Our love is buried with you."

16:57.916 --> 17:00.375
Such a touching epitaph

17:01.666 --> 17:03.375
will remain with him forever.

17:04.833 --> 17:05.666
Madame,

17:06.375 --> 17:07.750
the name's Masson.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.625
I'm the caretaker
of your husband’s final resting place.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.541
I shall make it my personal mission

17:14.625 --> 17:18.791
to ensure its integrity
is preserved in perpetuity.

17:19.916 --> 17:20.750
Please.

17:37.666 --> 17:40.333
Lord, our God,
you are the source of life.

17:40.833 --> 17:44.750
In you, we live and move
and have our being.

17:45.458 --> 17:49.416
Lead us to your kingdom through
your son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.416
Keep us in life and death,

17:52.916 --> 17:54.500
in your love,

17:55.000 --> 17:56.416
and by your grace.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.041
Amen.

18:03.041 --> 18:03.958
Almost there.

18:07.875 --> 18:08.708
Oh.

18:09.541 --> 18:11.250
Oh, that's it. That's it.

18:20.416 --> 18:21.833
Oh… Oh…

18:21.916 --> 18:22.916
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.375
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.041
Lord, don't let it be too late.

18:33.875 --> 18:34.708
Oh.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.125
-What?

18:40.208 --> 18:41.041
Ah!

18:41.125 --> 18:42.375
No, no! What? No!

18:45.583 --> 18:46.875
Oh, agh!

19:01.041 --> 19:03.250
Ah! Oh! No!

19:03.333 --> 19:04.625
No, no, please!

19:05.833 --> 19:07.458
Ah! No!

19:07.541 --> 19:08.625
No, God, no!

19:08.708 --> 19:10.708
No, no, no, no, please!

19:10.791 --> 19:12.333
No! No!

19:12.416 --> 19:13.541
No!

19:49.666 --> 19:50.791
Oh, God.

20:01.541 --> 20:03.250
Hah! Ah! Agh.

20:06.625 --> 20:11.750
Come on, Masson,
this is your pride, your prize, come on.

20:14.083 --> 20:14.958
Yup.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.541
I got you. I got you!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.708
Ah! Ah! Oh, God!

21:04.250 --> 21:05.791
Ah!

21:07.041 --> 21:09.041
-Agh!

21:25.750 --> 21:26.625
Oh!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.625
Cold, oh cold!

21:38.708 --> 21:41.833
Oh, cold! Oh, darkness! Oh, God! Oh God!

21:41.916 --> 21:42.958
Oh, God!

21:43.041 --> 21:45.250
Oh, God, oh, God! No, no!

21:45.333 --> 21:46.333
Oh!

21:47.791 --> 21:51.000
Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.666
You… You will survive this.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.541
You will. You will.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.666
Where are you?

22:08.416 --> 22:10.208
I will have my vengeance!

22:11.708 --> 22:12.916
Mark my words!

22:13.416 --> 22:16.666
Lest I will return with hellfire
for each and every one of you

22:16.750 --> 22:18.708
and your pestilent kin!

22:21.916 --> 22:23.916
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

22:31.958 --> 22:34.875
Smart. Smart, Masson, smart.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.416
Never give up. Never give up!

22:42.125 --> 22:46.166
That's how you're gonna beat them.
That's how you're gonna beat them.

22:53.625 --> 22:54.625
What?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.916
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

22:57.000 --> 22:59.125
No! Oh, God!

22:59.208 --> 23:01.416
God! No!

23:01.500 --> 23:03.166
God, no!

23:04.708 --> 23:06.583
What? No, no!

23:09.208 --> 23:11.916
God! No! No!

23:39.791 --> 23:40.750
Oh!

23:41.416 --> 23:42.791
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

23:48.375 --> 23:49.208
Wh…

26:00.333 --> 26:01.833
Aghh!

26:02.500 --> 26:03.875
Oh! Agh!

26:05.041 --> 26:05.916
Ah!

26:07.666 --> 26:09.291
Agh! No!

26:16.041 --> 26:17.875
-Ooh!

26:23.416 --> 26:24.958
Oh, God! Ah!

26:41.541 --> 26:44.333
Oh!

26:44.416 --> 26:45.833
Holy Jesus!

26:47.250 --> 26:48.083
Oh!

26:49.625 --> 26:50.458
Oh!

26:54.000 --> 26:54.833
Oh!

26:55.958 --> 26:59.041
Oh, Masson, Masson! You lucky bastard.

26:59.125 --> 27:00.000
Ohh.

27:02.916 --> 27:04.541
Ah! Oh!

27:18.250 --> 27:19.208
Hah.

27:26.458 --> 27:27.375
Oh!

27:52.750 --> 27:53.750
Black church.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.208
Oh.

28:37.291 --> 28:38.416
Glory be!

28:44.416 --> 28:46.333
Yeah. Oh.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.166
Oh. Come to me, darling.

28:53.416 --> 28:54.416
Okay.

28:58.166 --> 29:01.416
Here we go. Come, come, come, come, come.

29:07.833 --> 29:08.666
Come.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.708
Oh. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

29:13.791 --> 29:16.083
Hallelujah!

29:17.416 --> 29:18.250
Gotcha!

29:48.125 --> 29:49.500
Mine.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.083
Ah! Ah!

29:59.916 --> 30:01.041
Mine!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.541
Mine!

30:09.250 --> 30:10.583
Mine!

30:10.666 --> 30:12.208
Mine!

30:20.375 --> 30:22.083
Mine.

30:25.833 --> 30:27.916
Ah!

30:35.416 --> 30:37.083
Oh, God! Oh, God!

30:41.541 --> 30:45.458
Oh, Jesus, God above!
I swear to you my eternal piety!

30:46.208 --> 30:48.875
I will commit my heart
to you and only you!

30:49.833 --> 30:51.625
Please pity poor Masson.

30:53.750 --> 30:54.666
Oh!

30:55.250 --> 30:56.708
Ah! Yes!

31:11.750 --> 31:13.750
Oh!

31:29.250 --> 31:30.500
Come on, come on!

31:32.791 --> 31:33.833
Agh!

31:35.458 --> 31:36.333
Ah!

31:38.708 --> 31:41.333
Come on, fall, blast you!

31:44.875 --> 31:45.708
Agh!

32:54.666 --> 32:55.833
Ahh!

33:20.333 --> 33:22.291
Mine. Mine.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.166
Mine!

33:29.208 --> 33:30.500
Mine!

33:38.958 --> 33:39.791
Light!

33:41.916 --> 33:42.916
Oh my God!

33:43.833 --> 33:44.708
Oh my…

33:45.208 --> 33:48.833
Thank you, Jesus! I repent!

33:48.916 --> 33:50.958
A new Masson arises!

33:55.250 --> 33:57.666
"Long is the way and hard,

33:58.625 --> 34:00.958
that out of Hell leads up to light."

34:03.291 --> 34:05.166
"Long is the way and hard,

34:06.208 --> 34:08.375
that out of Hell leads up to light."

34:11.833 --> 34:15.041
"Long is the way and hard,

34:15.125 --> 34:17.458
that out of Hell leads up to light."

34:18.958 --> 34:25.125
"Long is the way and hard,
that out of Hell leads up to light"!

34:39.583 --> 34:40.458
No!

34:42.166 --> 34:43.000
No, no, no!

34:44.083 --> 34:46.291
No, no, no, no, no!

34:46.916 --> 34:49.250
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:49.333 --> 34:51.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

34:51.583 --> 34:53.500
No, no, no, no.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.000
No, no!

34:55.083 --> 34:57.333
No, no, no, no, no!

34:57.416 --> 34:59.583
-No!

35:02.875 --> 35:05.750
No! No!

35:05.833 --> 35:07.291
-No!

35:09.708 --> 35:11.166
No! No, no!

35:11.250 --> 35:13.583
Ah! Oh, God!

35:13.666 --> 35:14.708
Ah!

35:30.791 --> 35:31.916
Hey.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.208
Isn't that…

35:35.041 --> 35:36.291
Well, I'll be damned.

35:37.833 --> 35:38.666
It is.
