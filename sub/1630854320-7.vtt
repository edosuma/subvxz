WEBVTT

00:18.000 --> 00:20.219
(Ship horn blares)

00:20.319 --> 00:21.738
(Seagulls cawing)

00:21.838 --> 00:23.917
(Quiet suspenseful music)

00:37.390 --> 00:39.389
Is it them?

00:47.185 --> 00:49.184
(Engine ticking over)

01:03.936 --> 01:05.935
Why is it turning?

01:36.399 --> 01:38.518
(Boat engine idling)

02:37.567 --> 02:39.566
(Distant shouting)

02:41.285 --> 02:43.644
(Eerie music)

02:51.879 --> 02:53.878
(Suspenseful music)

03:36.496 --> 03:38.935
(Dramatic music)

04:00.843 --> 04:02.842
(Phone ringing)

04:03.402 --> 04:05.401
(Phone vibrating)

04:06.440 --> 04:07.540
Luan.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.858
(Luan) It's done.
We have Asif's heroin.

04:10.958 --> 04:13.436
All 140 million of it.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.389
(Elliot) You know how it feels
to be powerless.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.426
To be a pawn
in someone else's game.

04:36.344 --> 04:41.422
The things it makes you do...
just to hold on to some kind of life.

04:42.301 --> 04:44.540
That's all my dad ever knew.

04:45.779 --> 04:51.277
Throwing fights for money,
night after night.

04:51.377 --> 04:53.435
(Charlie)
Elliot.

04:53.535 --> 04:58.053
- What do I always say?
- (Both) Pawns can't be kings.

04:59.772 --> 05:02.830
(Elliot) He was my dad,
so I believed him,

05:02.930 --> 05:05.489
but it took me years
to understand.

05:06.728 --> 05:08.707
That's how he found his dignity.

05:08.807 --> 05:10.307
Ah, Jesus!

05:10.407 --> 05:14.144
(Elliot)
But I... I couldn't accept it.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.483
- (Distant cheering)
- I needed to know.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.539
What does it feel like

05:25.639 --> 05:27.018
to be a king?

05:27.118 --> 05:29.476
(Deep breath out)

05:46.907 --> 05:48.886
(Scream fades)

05:48.986 --> 05:51.045
(Phone vibrating)

05:51.145 --> 05:53.144
- (Police radios)
- (Siren wailing)

05:56.582 --> 05:57.562
Hello?

05:57.662 --> 06:00.940
(Merwan) Sean,
Asif's shipment was stolen.

06:01.740 --> 06:05.498
The heroin is gone.
Somebody betrayed us.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.135
Sean?

06:29.925 --> 06:31.104
Fuck!

06:31.204 --> 06:33.763
- Sean, what's going on?
- The heroin's gone.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.701
All 1.3 fucking tons of it.

06:36.801 --> 06:38.900
(Footsteps running down stairs)

06:39.000 --> 06:42.138
- Look, it's just one shipment.
- No, no. It's more than that.

06:42.238 --> 06:43.777
Koba and I made a statement.

06:43.877 --> 06:45.616
We made it clear London was ours

06:45.716 --> 06:47.855
and someone just decided
the fuck it wasn't!

06:47.955 --> 06:49.954
Who knew the routes?

06:51.633 --> 06:53.332
- Merwan and Koba.
- Right, Merwan, then.

06:53.432 --> 06:55.251
- Retaliation for Lale.
- No. He doesn't know.

06:55.351 --> 06:58.310
He doesn't know that...
He doesn't know.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.888
And he's made peace with us
using Asif's heroin.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.427
- He knows it's a necessity.
- So Koba?

07:06.266 --> 07:08.844
Koba has nothing to gain
from weakening our position.

07:08.944 --> 07:11.623
But he has everything to gain
by weakening yours.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.699
I am aware of my situation.

07:21.857 --> 07:23.856
(Billy)
Sean...

07:25.815 --> 07:27.814
(Sean)
Koba. We have a problem...

07:30.493 --> 07:32.492
Koba and Merwan.

07:33.251 --> 07:36.090
They aren't the only two people
who know the route.

07:37.569 --> 07:40.987
- You know it.
- What did you say?

07:41.087 --> 07:43.486
- I said you know the routes.
- No.

07:44.526 --> 07:47.064
You just accused me
of betraying my own son.

07:47.164 --> 07:49.543
You didn't like the deal
Sean made with Koba.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.261
You want to see
the Wallaces on top. Singular.

07:52.361 --> 07:55.500
I'm just asking you if maybe
you aren't being entirely honest

07:55.600 --> 07:57.599
about which Wallace that is.

08:00.077 --> 08:02.076
Jesus, Billy!

08:09.672 --> 08:12.111
I've really failed you,
haven't I?

08:26.224 --> 08:29.522
(Asif on phone) We aren't
talking days. We're talking weeks.

08:29.622 --> 08:32.700
- Minimum three.
- (Koba) Fu-u-uck!

08:33.620 --> 08:35.819
How did you let this happen?

08:36.858 --> 08:41.695
We didn't let anything happen.
Someone on your side betrayed us.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.694
(Asif) Or one of you
betrayed the other.

08:50.011 --> 08:52.550
We need to fix this now, Asif.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.928
Not in three weeks.
Now.

08:56.008 --> 08:58.187
(Sean) This is as much
your problem as it is ours.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.906
(Asif)
How so?

09:00.006 --> 09:02.684
Because of the price I paid you.

09:03.484 --> 09:05.483
Because I gave you Lale.

09:05.843 --> 09:07.982
We can't claim a monopoly
on the drugs trade

09:08.082 --> 09:09.781
if we don't have
any fucking drugs to sell.

09:09.881 --> 09:12.579
I'm here in Lahore.
There is no product yet.

09:12.679 --> 09:14.678
What do you want me to do?

09:18.476 --> 09:21.774
Give me a reason not to send Merwan
and a team of Kurds to Lahore

09:21.874 --> 09:23.873
to wipe out you and your family.

09:27.671 --> 09:29.670
(Sean)
Clock's ticking, Asif.

09:33.828 --> 09:35.367
All right.

09:35.467 --> 09:40.025
I made a delivery to Bibi Agostini
in Paris. A week ago, maybe.

09:41.064 --> 09:44.023
No way they could have moved
even 20% yet.

09:44.662 --> 09:47.981
So we go to Paris and take
the rest from this French fuck.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.098
Agostini's one of the biggest
players in France.

09:52.738 --> 09:56.296
You don't take from Agostini.
You make a deal.

09:57.456 --> 09:59.654
(Upbeat Algerian music)

10:02.933 --> 10:04.932
(Bubbling)

10:05.851 --> 10:07.850
(Saba)
What's it about?

10:09.569 --> 10:11.568
Here, this is for you.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.503
(Saba) Rasha Zidane?
(Scoffs)

10:21.603 --> 10:23.602
What is this for?

10:24.721 --> 10:27.040
(Sighs) You're going home
for a few days.

10:29.919 --> 10:31.918
Paris? Why?

10:36.595 --> 10:38.494
Koba asked for you again.

10:38.594 --> 10:42.092
Him and Sean Wallace are going
over to make some big deal.

10:42.192 --> 10:44.191
They want you there as a translator.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.289
Is this a fucking joke?

10:47.389 --> 10:49.688
You tell me you're going to make
Sean pay for Basem.

10:49.788 --> 10:52.027
And now you want me
to work for him?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.701
You work for me, Saba.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.359
You understand?

11:06.459 --> 11:08.938
So that means you work
for Sean Wallace now.

11:12.216 --> 11:14.215
It's the way it goes.

11:15.814 --> 11:17.813
Don't look at him, look at me.

11:19.932 --> 11:21.751
Koba asked for our help.

11:21.851 --> 11:23.850
Hm?

11:26.569 --> 11:28.808
Do you understand me?

11:29.847 --> 11:31.846
(Hakim)
That's good for us.

11:40.082 --> 11:42.081
(Hakim)
Saba.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.198
Don't fuck this up.

11:53.195 --> 11:55.194
(Door opens)

11:56.753 --> 11:58.752
(Door closes)

12:07.587 --> 12:09.586
(Car engine stops)

12:17.302 --> 12:19.301
We've got Sean
and Koba's heroin.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.859
Luan intercepted it,
and we're going to distribute it.

12:25.058 --> 12:28.676
Marian told Dad that Sean
and Koba are going to Paris

12:28.776 --> 12:30.995
to buy more
from a dealer out there.

12:31.095 --> 12:33.114
When?

12:33.214 --> 12:35.213
- Tomorrow.
- Where?

12:36.412 --> 12:39.271
Where?
Her office?

12:39.371 --> 12:42.309
Club, restaurant,
Agostini's fucking house? Where?

12:42.409 --> 12:44.648
- I don't know. I'll find out.
- Thank you.

12:47.246 --> 12:49.245
Elliot, are you sleeping?

12:50.165 --> 12:51.824
You're not thinking clearly.

12:51.924 --> 12:54.662
After you kill Sean,
what you gonna do?

12:54.762 --> 12:56.841
Look, I want you
to come out of this alive.

12:58.281 --> 13:01.859
When Marian Wallace finds out
her son's dead because of you,

13:01.959 --> 13:03.958
what are you gonna do?

13:11.793 --> 13:16.791
If we do this right, it doesn't
just end with Sean and Koba dead.

13:19.150 --> 13:22.908
You and me. We could build
something together.

13:30.344 --> 13:32.682
But if you're not in the right shape
for that, then we should wait...

13:32.782 --> 13:35.601
They can't cross international borders
with an army of mercenaries.

13:35.701 --> 13:37.760
They'll be vulnerable out there.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.338
And I got people in Paris.
They won't see me coming.

13:58.509 --> 14:01.627
(Ed) We should move on this, fast.
What's our plan?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.604
We need to get ahead
of this Agostini problem.

14:07.704 --> 14:11.742
Luan, contact your men
and get them to move this now.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.899
(Birds cawing)

14:34.890 --> 14:36.889
(Marian)
To weaken Koba's position...

14:37.728 --> 14:40.467
we sell to the gangs
for half price.

14:40.567 --> 14:44.385
Flood the market with our heroin
before Sean and Koba do.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.184
- (Ed) Agreed.
- (Luan) Yes.

14:46.284 --> 14:48.283
(Marian) Okay.
Let's get to work.

14:48.882 --> 14:50.881
(Eerie music)

14:56.278 --> 14:58.517
(Engine starts)

15:02.075 --> 15:04.834
(Dramatic music)

15:12.510 --> 15:14.589
(Engine starts)

16:31.228 --> 16:33.227
(Ringing)

16:35.746 --> 16:37.745
(Gun clicks)

16:44.102 --> 16:46.101
The phone.

17:03.771 --> 17:05.510
(Phone beeps)

17:05.610 --> 17:07.190
(Ringing)

17:07.290 --> 17:09.288
(Phone rings)

17:13.446 --> 17:15.505
- Billy?
- It's Luan.

17:15.605 --> 17:17.604
- Billy found the heroin.
- What?

17:25.600 --> 17:27.499
(Luan)
Marian.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.598
What do you want
me to do with him?

17:32.037 --> 17:34.035
Um...

17:40.072 --> 17:42.071
(Luan)
Understood.

17:43.071 --> 17:45.070
Get in.

17:46.389 --> 17:49.008
Luan, you can't lock me
in a van filled with heroin.

17:49.108 --> 17:52.226
I'm not. Your mother is.
Get in.

18:05.819 --> 18:10.057
Luan, whatever she's paying you,
Sean will double it.

18:10.896 --> 18:12.935
He'll... He'll double it.

18:13.815 --> 18:15.753
Luan! Luan!

18:15.853 --> 18:18.952
- Please! Please, Luan!
- (Banging)

18:19.052 --> 18:22.070
Luan, he'll double it.
Don't leave me in here!

18:22.170 --> 18:24.169
Luan!

18:25.608 --> 18:27.807
(Container doors closing)

18:37.802 --> 18:40.960
(Yelling) Please! Luan!

18:43.839 --> 18:46.557
(Bell tolling)

19:05.987 --> 19:08.006
Beautiful city.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.004
- Nice to be home?
- I'm from Saint Denis.

19:11.104 --> 19:13.103
This is no more my home
than Buckingham Palace.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.819
Regarde les pâtisseries!

19:32.693 --> 19:34.592
Okay.

19:34.692 --> 19:38.190
What the fuck?
This is recon, you can't do this now!

19:38.290 --> 19:39.789
Fucking tourists

19:39.889 --> 19:41.988
and cops everywhere!

19:42.088 --> 19:44.167
(Quiet suspenseful music)

19:47.645 --> 19:50.804
(Muffled voice on police radio)

19:53.642 --> 19:55.821
(Classical music playing softly)

19:55.921 --> 19:57.920
Merci.

20:13.911 --> 20:15.730
Merci.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.829
Merci.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.508
(Koba)
Merci.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.662
Bibi Agostini.

20:34.541 --> 20:37.599
(Bibi speaking in French)

20:37.699 --> 20:39.858
(Saba translating)
We can order. It's her place.

20:43.896 --> 20:46.814
(Chuckles)
Well, Bibi, it's a pleasure.

20:47.654 --> 20:49.473
I believe you know
why we're here?

20:49.573 --> 20:54.170
(Bibi speaking in French)

20:55.250 --> 20:57.948
Someone stole your heroin and
you'd like some of hers to replace it?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.247
So, how about it?

21:02.006 --> 21:08.023
- (Bibi speaking in French)
- (Saba) I don't like waste.

21:08.123 --> 21:10.182
(Saba)
So I only order what I need.

21:10.282 --> 21:11.821
(Bibi continues
speaking in French)

21:11.921 --> 21:13.540
Which means I need what I order.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.779
It's a temporary measure.
We'll replace it before you miss it.

21:15.879 --> 21:19.657
(Bibi continues
speaking in French)

21:19.757 --> 21:21.796
Unless they steal the next load.

21:26.713 --> 21:30.331
- (Bibi laughs)
- Is that it, then?

21:30.431 --> 21:32.510
- Hm?
- (Sean) Au revoir.

21:35.748 --> 21:40.406
(Bibi speaking in French)

21:40.506 --> 21:43.724
Finn Wallace would have burned
this fucking place down if he was here.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.843
That sounds like him.

21:45.943 --> 21:49.581
(Bibi continues
speaking in French)

21:53.739 --> 21:56.058
After spending an hour
trying to fuck her.

21:57.057 --> 22:00.855
That definitely sounds like him.
Luckily, I take after my mother.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.113
(Bibi)
Not too much, I hope.

22:04.213 --> 22:09.391
So... (continues
speaking in French)

22:09.491 --> 22:12.529
The heroin. How much do you want?
How much are you willing to pay?

22:14.568 --> 22:17.327
We want half of it,
and we're paying nothing.

22:18.806 --> 22:21.065
(Bibi speaking in French)

22:21.165 --> 22:23.164
It must be my birthday.

22:23.803 --> 22:26.262
(Sean)
We're proposing a partnership.

22:26.362 --> 22:28.780
Our cities have never
worked together.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.839
(Saba translates)

22:35.797 --> 22:37.536
(Sean)
We have no pay masters.

22:37.636 --> 22:39.935
(Saba translates)

22:40.035 --> 22:43.893
It's an advanced system that sees
the money flow faster, one way.

22:43.993 --> 22:47.970
(Saba translates)

22:48.070 --> 22:51.249
We own the ports, the routes
and the infrastructure.

22:51.349 --> 22:55.826
(Saba translates)

24:02.911 --> 24:05.070
- (Sean) I like her.
- (Koba) Hm.

Let's see what she wants
in return.

24:19.742 --> 24:21.781

You go see your old friends
but be there 8:30.

You fucking liar.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.347
I'm doing this for Sean.

25:28.106 --> 25:30.705
Bullshit. That's bullshit.

ends one way.

consigned to history.

25:55.692 --> 25:59.190

you'd be the Wallace on top.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.529
You thought it was finally your turn.

26:03.248 --> 26:07.046
But since he came back, it's fucked
everything up for you, hasn't it?

26:09.165 --> 26:11.344

come back at all.

46:45.194 --> 46:47.634
This is why we don't want
to do business with London.

46:48.473 --> 46:49.453
Deal's off!

46:49.553 --> 46:50.652
Come on, let's go.

46:50.752 --> 46:52.751
- Fuck's sake!
- Go!

46:53.950 --> 46:55.948
- (Door closes)
- Oh.

47:01.426 --> 47:03.425
(Elevator pings)

47:04.425 --> 47:06.504
(Gunfire)

47:12.461 --> 47:14.460
There he is.

47:22.176 --> 47:24.035
(Men shouting)

47:24.135 --> 47:26.133
(Panicked cries)

47:32.890 --> 47:35.249
He's back here. Go, go, go!

47:58.357 --> 48:00.295
What happened?
Whoa!

48:00.395 --> 48:02.394
- Where's the girl?
- Fuck!

48:09.151 --> 48:11.149
Give me your phone.

48:16.267 --> 48:18.426
Come on.

48:20.545 --> 48:22.203
Look at it.

48:22.304 --> 48:24.303
Look at it.

48:29.899 --> 48:31.899
"Wrong room. Abort."

48:33.138 --> 48:35.136
You're working with Elliot?

48:36.696 --> 48:38.694
(Whimpering)

48:39.015 --> 48:41.993
Who else are you
fucking working with? Hm?

48:42.094 --> 48:44.392
(Whimpering) No one. Just him.

48:44.492 --> 48:46.431
I don't expect to have to ask twice.

48:46.531 --> 48:48.590
(Yelling) Who else
are you fucking working with?

48:48.689 --> 48:52.048
(Crying) I swear to you.
I don't even know him.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.886
I don't even know the fucking...

48:57.246 --> 48:59.663
Please. Please.

48:59.764 --> 49:01.803
Sean. Not here.

49:05.881 --> 49:08.140
Our heroin's stolen,

49:08.240 --> 49:11.238
an attempt made
on our life in two days.

49:13.797 --> 49:15.796
We have a traitor.

49:17.234 --> 49:22.073
Believe me, she's going
to tell me who the fuck it is.

49:30.388 --> 49:32.386
Fucking English!

49:33.466 --> 49:35.046
(Elevator pings)

49:35.145 --> 49:37.544
(Suspenseful music)

49:55.255 --> 49:57.254
(Phone buzzing)

50:06.408 --> 50:08.148
(Elliot) It's fucked, Shannon!
It's fucked!

50:08.247 --> 50:10.787
Sean will know by now it was me
and he'll trace that back to you.

50:10.886 --> 50:13.366
You got to get Danny and run.

50:14.444 --> 50:16.823
I'm not going anywhere.

50:16.924 --> 50:20.042
No. Shannon, I'll fix it. I promise.
I just need to figure out how.

50:22.721 --> 50:26.399
I know how. Elliot, I know
how you can get to Sean.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.756
Tonight.

50:50.026 --> 50:52.825
Do you believe
there are any rules in this world?

50:55.384 --> 50:57.381
I only know one.

51:03.419 --> 51:08.457
People suffer because they mean
nothing to the powerful.

51:09.456 --> 51:11.455
My dad.

51:11.975 --> 51:15.252
You.
It's all the same world.

51:15.933 --> 51:21.649
They don't even feel like sacrifices.
They just mean nothing.

51:25.127 --> 51:26.907
Tell me I'm wrong.

51:27.006 --> 51:29.006
Tell me they pay for their sins.

51:32.004 --> 51:35.002
I want them to know fear.

51:37.162 --> 51:39.160
To be powerless.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.638
To feel it in their bones.

51:46.916 --> 51:49.395
(Eerie music)

51:52.513 --> 51:54.532
(Footsteps approaching)

51:54.631 --> 51:58.830
But how do you do that? Hm?

52:02.268 --> 52:07.705
How do you turn a king into a pawn?

52:16.461 --> 52:18.460
(Heavy, metallic scraping)

52:36.850 --> 52:39.589
It was going well
until Elliot stormed the building

52:39.689 --> 52:41.688
in an attempt to assassinate us.

52:46.885 --> 52:48.884
(Sean sighs)

52:50.523 --> 52:52.761
Somehow he knew
we were in Paris.

53:02.397 --> 53:04.995
(Discordant music)

53:06.714 --> 53:09.313
We have a traitor, Mum,

53:09.953 --> 53:12.810
one with inside knowledge
of the routes and the meeting.

53:12.911 --> 53:14.910
(Knocking)

53:22.026 --> 53:24.024
(Knocking)

53:28.863 --> 53:30.862
(Knocking)

53:48.971 --> 53:50.971
(Door closes)

53:53.810 --> 53:55.809
(Sean)
Who sent Elliot to Paris?

53:58.487 --> 54:01.526
Clearly the Algerian girl
was working with him.

54:03.165 --> 54:06.643
But how could they know
we'd be there? Hm?

54:10.761 --> 54:14.078
Mum,
do you have anything to say?

54:21.314 --> 54:23.314
Mum?

54:32.269 --> 54:34.268
Well?

54:37.227 --> 54:39.225
Sean.

54:57.696 --> 54:59.694
Sean.

55:14.807 --> 55:17.006
(Sound distorting)

55:25.881 --> 55:27.939
(Marian)
Sean.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.319
(Dramatic music)
