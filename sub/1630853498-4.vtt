WEBVTT

00:20.360 --> 00:22.280
Couldn't Bodhi
have come with us at least?

00:22.360 --> 00:24.760
I want you and Ari
to spend some time together,

00:24.840 --> 00:26.320
it would be good for you.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.000
Do you honestly think he
wants to be around me?

00:28.080 --> 00:28.960
No, he doesn't.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.040
Marlon!

00:30.480 --> 00:32.760
He still blames me
for the accident.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.120
He actually said that?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.600
He doesn't
have to say anything.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.920
He picked a fight with me,
remember?

00:44.040 --> 00:47.840
You know Ari, I know it's been
a really tough year for you,

00:47.920 --> 00:49.680
but you know,
the past is the past,

00:49.760 --> 00:50.760
it's done now.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.000
You say "Sorry",
and you move on.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.200
I have nothing to say sorry for.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.280
All right!?

00:59.040 --> 01:00.920
-Yo!

01:16.720 --> 01:18.600
I don't even want to look
at the rankings right now.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.400
I really need big
scores this weekend.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.680
Bods, you're going to be great.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.360
You always kill at Jackson Bay.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.560
I just never know
which board to use.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.200
I was thinking the 6, but the
6'1 felt good the other day too.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.600
Yeah who could tell?
Big decisions.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.520
Anyway, what's the
move with tonight?

01:31.600 --> 01:32.960
Is there an afterparty
or something?

01:33.040 --> 01:35.560
If by afterparty you mean
Marlon's mum separating

01:35.640 --> 01:37.840
the girls and boys and sending
us all to bed by 7 o'clock.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.600
But it's cool. We'll just
hang out in our room.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.720
Let me guess. Give each other
mani-pedis and talk about boys.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.240
Sorry, is that what you
usually do at sleepovers?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.400
No.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.000
I don't know.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.840
Honestly, I don't really do
the whole female bonding thing.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.080
Girls are way too much drama.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.760
Um, have you spent any
time with Ari and Marlon?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.640
Compared to those drama queens,
we're chill.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.280
You know what
chills out drama queens?

02:00.360 --> 02:01.920
Big-ass parties!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.080
Ah hello,
supervising adult here.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.560
There'll be no big parties
this weekend, not on my watch.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.840
This is a getaway
for you Summer,

02:07.920 --> 02:08.960
but we're here to compete.

02:09.040 --> 02:09.920
So am I.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.640
No, for real!

02:12.640 --> 02:14.800
I thought you just told Ari's
parents that so he could come.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.440
I did, at first.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.640
But then I was like,
whatever I may as well do it.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.560
Wait, you actually
entered the competition?

02:20.640 --> 02:21.840
What?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.720
How hard could it be?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.080
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

02:41.160 --> 02:41.960
Shoulder's good.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.600
Yeah, I will, I will.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.960
Okay, look I've got to go,
we're about to warm up.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.680
All right,
love you too Mum, bye.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.520
Sorry.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.840
Hey, you never apologise
for taking the time

02:54.920 --> 02:56.160
to tell your mother you
love her, all right?

02:56.240 --> 02:58.200
But you could have warned me
Summer was going to surf today.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.760
I didn't think she was actually
going through with this.

03:00.840 --> 03:01.680
She's mental.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.640
-Marlon.
-This is ridiculous.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.760
Can't we complain or
something?

03:05.320 --> 03:08.600
He's a pain, but he's the judge!
Getting angry doesn't help.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.520
I just don't get that guy...

03:10.720 --> 03:12.200
Hey, what's going on?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.880
That judge, Roberts,

03:13.960 --> 03:15.880
he doesn't like the way
that Marlon surfs.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.040
Every time, he scores me down.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.560
Hey look, you can't control
what the judges do, yeah?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.320
So just focus on
what you can control.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.440
I'm just saying
if I lose today,

03:24.520 --> 03:25.400
it's not my fault.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.800
-What?

03:26.880 --> 03:28.520
No, no, nothing.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.080
All right, all right you two.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.360
Poppy's about to start her heat.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.360
Let's get behind her, yeah?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.680
Let's go, Pops!

03:53.560 --> 03:55.360
Tetanui
all power on this wave

03:55.440 --> 03:57.800
and posts another
impressive score.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.120
She's going to be
hard to beat now.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.520
Come on stupid rope.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.960
This comp
is the second round

04:03.040 --> 04:04.280
of the state championships.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.000
These groms determined
to improve their rankings

04:07.080 --> 04:09.600
and give themselves every
chance to make the state team.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.160
Hey, could you just run
through the rules again?

04:11.240 --> 04:12.080
Which ones?

04:12.160 --> 04:14.920
Just, all of them.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.840
Oh okay, you got four
competitors, 20 minutes,

04:20.920 --> 04:22.640
and only your best two
waves count, all right?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.520
Now the key rule is priority.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.960
So, the first person to catch
a wave gets first priority

04:28.040 --> 04:30.680
and the second person to catch
a wave gets next priority.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.640
Now, even if you
don't have priority,

04:32.720 --> 04:34.120
you can still
catch a wave, right?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.280
As long as you don't obstruct
the person in front of you

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
and just...

04:39.400 --> 04:40.560
Hey, you know what?

04:40.640 --> 04:42.240
Just have fun
out there, yeah?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.400
-Hey, Pops!

04:44.480 --> 04:46.280
...for heat one
of the Under 16 Girls,

04:46.360 --> 04:49.800
Tetanui, Lineker,
advancing to the quarters.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.560
Now stick around because
heat two's up next

04:51.640 --> 04:55.160
with a very special competitor
all the way from the U.S. of A.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.400
You won't want to miss this.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.680
It's not too late to pull out.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.320
No one would think less of you.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.000
You worried I might
beat you or something?

05:03.080 --> 05:06.560
I'm just saying, some people
might think it's disrespectful.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.520
People train really
hard for these comps.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.840
They're serious.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.720
Says the girl who puts
on a full face of makeup

05:11.800 --> 05:13.920
before getting in the water.

05:14.000 --> 05:14.920
Hey Sheridan.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.320
Can she even surf?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.880
You're about to find out.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.080
Get in my way and I will break
more than just your skateboard.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.240
Our heat two
competitors are in position.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.280
We're just seconds away now.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.840
Tran and Morehouse aren't
wasting a second here.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.880
Morehouse currently
leading the state ranking

05:53.960 --> 05:55.960
and it's easy to see why.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.600
Mercer goes again just
clinging to second place.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.240
Torres in red
finally makes her move

06:07.320 --> 06:09.920
and ouch, oof, okay.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.840
Torres goes head first
into the soup again.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.280
Time's running out if she
wants to post a score.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.920
Hey, where'd you
find her, Tetanui?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.800
Should ask for a refund.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.920
Nice try Summer,
next one's yours.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.320
Torres, I'm told,

06:33.400 --> 06:35.960
is the daughter of the
surf legend Margot Torres.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.800
I guess I can see
the resemblance.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.480
Great ride from Morehouse there,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.480
knocking Bodhi Mercer
into third.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.880
She'll need an eight or better

06:43.960 --> 06:47.280
to have any chance of
making the quarter finals.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.200
Not so easy, is it?

06:48.280 --> 06:50.560
Not doing so well
yourself, princess.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.280
Get out of her way!

07:02.360 --> 07:04.680
Whoa, Torres
with a blatant drop in there,

07:04.760 --> 07:06.600
so the score won't even count.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.800
That's how we do it
in NYC baby, yeah!

07:21.400 --> 07:23.520
Bodhi Mercer
and Summer Torres are out.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.160
Yo, I got one!

07:31.840 --> 07:33.480
Hey, good job.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.160
Yo, what's her problem?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.640
We were just having fun.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.880
Third place means she's
out of the comp, Summer.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.760
You just massacred her chances
of making the state team.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.880
Nice work, America.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.880
Was that bad?

07:55.480 --> 07:56.680
It wasn't good.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.560
Did you see him
out there, though?

07:59.640 --> 08:02.040
You know, sometimes
I wish I could care

08:02.120 --> 08:03.040
as little as you do.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.280
Maybe I'll teach
you sometime.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.640
-Oh my God!

08:05.720 --> 08:06.720
Now the
waves are firing

08:06.800 --> 08:08.600
and the Under 16 Boys
are ready to go.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.160
Hey boys, where'd
you get her from?

08:32.240 --> 08:36.640
Even for a Shorehaven kook,
that chick was bad.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.240
Let's smoke 'em.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.240
Three finalists in the house
tonight baby, let's go!

08:57.000 --> 08:58.200
-Nice brother.
-Thanks.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.800
-Hey Poppy, need a hand?
-Come dance with me.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.080
Come on,
don't let me dance on my own.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.280
Hey, don't beat
yourself up, all right?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.160
You picked the right waves,
you just got unlucky.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
That's one word for it.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.000
Hey, but here's to
Summer's first comp.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.160
A little bit unorthodox,

09:20.240 --> 09:21.960
but everyone loves
a kook slam, right?

09:22.040 --> 09:24.080
Hey, I do what I can.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.840
Are you seriously
sending us to bed?

09:28.920 --> 09:30.000
It's still light out.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.520
Our finalists need their rest.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.560
I don't want tired
surfers there tomorrow

09:34.640 --> 09:37.240
and I don't want my
sister-in-law's house destroyed.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.280
You heard the boss.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.440
Oh, and I will be
sleeping in the hallway

09:43.520 --> 09:45.720
so there's no funny business.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.880
I can't believe this.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.920
See what we mean?

09:48.000 --> 09:48.800
Told you.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.160
Goodnight boys,
goodnight girls.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.640
Lights out.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.520
What, no cuddling?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.200
Maybe I should sleep
on the couch then.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.960
Sure, sounds good.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.000
Come on man, when is
this going to stop?

10:12.480 --> 10:14.640
You jumped, I didn't.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.640
You need to get over it.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.280
You seriously think that's
what I'm hung up on?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.320
So, what is it then?

10:26.640 --> 10:28.000
Is it the Bodhi thing?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.640
Hit the lights
when you're done.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.440
So I kind of screwed up
your heat today, huh?

10:44.680 --> 10:45.440
Look, you didn't help

10:45.520 --> 10:47.880
but I would have needed
a pretty amazing score

10:47.960 --> 10:49.200
on that last wave anyway.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.080
I just wasn't good enough.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.600
Must be tough going up
against Poppy all the time.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.960
No, I love seeing her win.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.760
Poppy's always been
the big talent.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.080
I've got my own
relationship with surfing.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.960
You mean posting body
shots for internet creeps?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.160
You might think it's cheap,

11:07.240 --> 11:09.840
but my photography is my
way of expressing myself.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.240
It makes me feel good.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.760
Plus personal branding's
a huge part

11:12.840 --> 11:14.680
of pro surfing these days.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.640
It's how people make
a career out of it.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.160
Must be cool to know what
you want to do with your life.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.480
I have no idea.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.520
What are you two talking about?

11:27.600 --> 11:31.720
Oh, you know,
just mani-pedis, boys.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.120
Girly stuff, right Summer?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.920
Yeah, right.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.240
Come on.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.840
Shh.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.920
Come on, we're sneaking out.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.840
No way, I got finals tomorrow
and if I don't win,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.920
my chances of making
the state team are shot.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.440
Ari, remember I said I'd
teach you to care less?

12:18.520 --> 12:19.440
This is lesson one.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.400
Nice jammies, by the way.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.320
Shut up.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.920
I knew it'd
be a full moon.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.160
I could feel it all day.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.600
It's been ages
since we snuck out.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.200
I think the last
time was midnight,

12:31.280 --> 12:32.840
skinny dipping for my birthday.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.080
Yeah, that was right before...

12:39.160 --> 12:41.920
Yeah, a lot's
changed since then.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.720
Okay seriously, you guys
need to talk some stuff out,

12:44.800 --> 12:46.040
because this whole

12:46.120 --> 12:47.440
'don't mention the
before times' routine

12:47.520 --> 12:49.120
is getting super boring.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.680
Summer, this isn't New York.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.760
We don't all go to therapy
every five minutes.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.400
What?

12:54.480 --> 12:55.920
Who said anything about therapy?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.520
I've got something way better.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.280
It's a game I played back home.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.560
It's called 'Shame'.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.720
You say something like,
I don't know,

13:02.800 --> 13:03.960
"I've never read the poetry

13:04.040 --> 13:05.880
Ari hides in the
shoebox under his bed".

13:05.960 --> 13:07.240
Oi, that is private.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.000
Because I have,
I write an 'S' on my forehead.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.440
First mark of 'Shame'.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.320
First one to get the full
word on their head loses.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.240
Who's in?

13:20.160 --> 13:21.680
You have not
seen a ghost, Poppy.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.320
I have.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.240
Okay.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.160
All right, I've never peed
during a competition heat.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.520
Um, everyone does that.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.360
Not me.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.600
Okay come on guys,
these questions are lame.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.280
I want the dirt.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.520
How about, I've never had a
crush on someone on this roof.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.520
Obviously.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.160
I saw that, Poppy.
Who is it?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.320
Hey, no follow-up questions.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.200
Is it me?

13:48.280 --> 13:49.360
I mean, I could
hardly blame you,

13:49.440 --> 13:50.600
I'm like a total 10.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.080
Yeah Summer, it's you.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.080
Who's next?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.400
Hold on, not Ari?

13:59.680 --> 14:01.160
Come on, next question.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.200
-Oh man, this is too good.
-It's too good.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.400
Marlon, leave it.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.280
What?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.000
Don't be a jerk.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.640
Me? You're the one who's
been acting like a tool

14:10.760 --> 14:11.960
ever since you came back.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.360
Hey, come on, next question.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.680
Yeah, all right,
how about this one?

14:15.760 --> 14:17.560
I've never left a friend
lying in hospital for months

14:17.640 --> 14:19.200
without once coming to visit.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.080
Anyone?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.240
Marlon told us you
didn't want any visitors.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.160
I, I thought...

14:35.240 --> 14:36.480
I can't believe you.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.320
Ari, we would have come.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.560
He told us you didn't
want to see anyone.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.880
Yeah well, I did.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.840
I'm going back to bed.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.360
Ari, come on.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.720
Come on, man.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.600
Ari.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.840
Marlon?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.000
I'm okay.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.000
What on earth?

15:08.080 --> 15:11.280
What, what is
going on here?

15:12.280 --> 15:14.240
Oh my God!

15:20.120 --> 15:21.160
Well folks,

15:21.240 --> 15:23.800
after some thrilling
semi-finals yesterday,

15:23.880 --> 15:25.400
it all comes down to this.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.240
Some amazing skills
on display so far.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.000
I reckon we're in for
a bit of a treat today.

15:30.080 --> 15:30.920
Look at this.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.360
How are you going
to perform today, hmm?

15:36.840 --> 15:38.040
A set of car keys

15:38.120 --> 15:40.240
have been handed in at
the registration tent.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.040
It's pretty
flat out there

15:42.120 --> 15:43.280
so you're going to have
to take your chances

15:43.360 --> 15:44.400
when they come, all right?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.240
And try and hold back
off those big cutbacks,

15:46.320 --> 15:48.120
otherwise that wave's going
to race right past you.

15:48.920 --> 15:49.880
Guys?

15:55.640 --> 15:56.720
Look, I don't know what
happened last night,

15:56.800 --> 15:59.480
and to be quite honest,
I don't care.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.280
What really gets me
is that you guys

16:02.360 --> 16:03.800
are the most talented
bunch of groms

16:03.880 --> 16:05.600
that have come out of
Shorehaven in years.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.040
So don't waste it guys, okay?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.240
Now walk it off and get
your heads in a game.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.160
Let's go, up, up,
up, up, up, up, up.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.440
Come back when you're
ready to focus.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.440
Hey, crazy night.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
You know, for someone who
thinks girls are too much drama,

16:27.560 --> 16:30.640
you sure like to stir
a lot of it up yourself.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.560
Maybe it's good
all that stuff came out.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.400
You know the truth now

16:33.480 --> 16:35.840
and you can start
working things out.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.520
If Ari ever talks to us again.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.080
So, I moved around a
lot when I was younger.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
It was hard to make
friends stick, you know?

16:47.240 --> 16:50.120
I just think it's cool how you
guys have each other's back.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.920
I've never really
had that before.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.720
Summer, are you saying

16:54.800 --> 16:56.320
you've caught friend
feelings for us?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.400
Ooh.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.440
You don't have to
make it sound so lame.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.760
-So Ari, for real?
-Oh shut up.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.200
Yeah?

17:04.280 --> 17:05.840
Hey, rip it up, Pops.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.840
Good surf chat, right?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.320
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.920
After a slow start,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.960
Tetanui's starting to
build some momentum

17:18.040 --> 17:20.480
against heavy favourites
Tran and Morehouse.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.080
Morehouse
lets that one go.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.320
Is it just me, or are
the Anchor Cove girls

17:31.400 --> 17:32.840
looking a bit spooked?

17:54.360 --> 17:56.600
And it's official,
your Jackson Bay

17:56.680 --> 17:59.560
Under 16 Girls winner
is Poppy Tetanui.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.760
On ya, Pops!

18:26.120 --> 18:28.520
Poppy's looking good
for state selection, hey?

18:32.240 --> 18:33.680
Cool that she likes you.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.120
You two would be good together.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.680
Hopefully the ankle holds up.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.440
Can't believe Summer made
us play that stupid game.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.840
Are you serious?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.280
Nothing's ever
your fault, is it?

18:54.360 --> 18:57.560
It's always the judges
or the waves, now Summer.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.240
Nothing is ever on you.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.440
Do you know how much it sucked
being stuck in that bed?

19:05.880 --> 19:07.600
Why would you tell everyone
I didn't want to see them?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.960
Why didn't you come?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.480
I don't know.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.480
You don't know,
that's it?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.560
Competitors
in the Under 16 Boys final,

19:22.640 --> 19:23.840
this is your
three minute warning.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.360
Boys, you're up,
let's go.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.680
Good luck out there.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.320
The Anchor Cove boys

19:35.400 --> 19:36.960
are putting on a
clinic here today

19:37.040 --> 19:39.000
in the Under 16 Boys final.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.560
Reigning champ Griff Temple
still the one to beat.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.040
He's been pretty
unstoppable this season.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.160
Gibson's placed at
a comfortable score

19:51.240 --> 19:54.320
but Sousa's been looking a
little sluggish out there today.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.560
I don't know, man.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.920
You can stay if you want.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.080
I'm going to go get pitted.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.000
Let's jump together.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.160
One.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
Two.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.880
Three.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.880
Ari?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.040
Bit of a lull here.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.680
Temple still with a
narrow lead over Ahmed

21:02.760 --> 21:05.800
and the boys from Shorehaven
have serious ground to make up.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.160
I was scared, okay?

21:13.240 --> 21:14.920
That's why I didn't come.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.320
I thought you blamed me
for what happened at Stairway.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.160
Why would I blame you?

21:20.240 --> 21:21.600
I'd blame me.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.760
And I thought if everyone
came and saw you,

21:24.840 --> 21:28.240
spoke to you,
they'd blame me too.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.280
I never blamed you
for the accident.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.760
I blamed you for disappearing,
for the next year.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.760
I'm really sorry, Ari.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.720
I should've been there.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.880
Yeah, you should have.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.160
Look man, it's your priority.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.360
You can still post one.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.360
Go get it, go for it.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.120
With just
seconds left in the final,

22:10.200 --> 22:13.280
Sousa pips Temple for
a nice three-footer.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.680
Can he pull off
a big upset here?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.680
Griff Temple
takes another big step

22:39.760 --> 22:42.000
towards retaining
his state title.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.960
Marlon Sousa with
a valiant second,

22:44.040 --> 22:45.520
and Gibson in third.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.960
Son, are you okay?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.680
What happened,
was it your ankle?

22:50.760 --> 22:51.960
No, my ankle's fine.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.040
Oh, well the judging
was ridiculous.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.720
That last wave was easily
a 10, that judge...

22:56.800 --> 22:58.160
I'm going to put
a stop to this...

22:58.240 --> 23:01.360
Stop, it's no one
else's fault, okay?

23:01.440 --> 23:02.280
It's mine.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.680
All right,
give it up for your champions,

23:11.760 --> 23:13.880
Griff Temple and Poppy Tetanui.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.720
On ya Pops, nice work!

23:19.800 --> 23:21.640
That's my girl,
yes Poppy!

23:22.320 --> 23:24.000
Let's go!

23:26.080 --> 23:28.080
Tetanui on the podium.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.240
Talk about a freak accident.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.560
Your haircut is
the freak accident.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.640
Yeah!

23:44.160 --> 23:46.320
Hey fellas,
can I get a photo?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.280
Hey, do you want
to ride with us?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.520
I think I'll stick
with the girls.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.520
Yo, you can go if you want.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.360
No, it's cool,
I'll come with you.
