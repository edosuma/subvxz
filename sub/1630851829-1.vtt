00:08.608 --> 00:11.578
<i>This year
in the Outer Banks,</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:16.049
<i>why do they call it the
Graveyard of the Atlantic?</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:17.584
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:17.617 --> 00:19.085
Hit the gas!
Hit the gas, dude!

00:19.152 --> 00:21.354
Whoo!
Scary.

00:21.421 --> 00:25.225
<i>It's home to
more than 2,000 shipwrecks.</i>

00:26.059 --> 00:28.261
BOBBY This place
eats boats up, dude.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.231
<i>A shifting ocean floor.</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:33.233
Am I on the bottom?

00:33.266 --> 00:36.169
<i>Brutal conditions.</i>

00:36.269 --> 00:38.004
JIMMIE Got
too much speed going.

00:38.071 --> 00:41.608
It's a good way to die.
It's a great way to die.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.712
Hang on!

00:45.745 --> 00:50.016
<i>And water so cold

00:50.083 --> 00:53.019

00:54.821 --> 00:57.657
<i>Earning a living here
is a matter of life.</i>

00:57.724 --> 00:59.926
The boat caught fire.
It's all gone.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.729
<i>And death.</i>

01:07.000 --> 01:11.271
<i>This season, the captains face
their harshest conditions ever.</i>

01:12.205 --> 01:16.276
<i>It's time to looks danger
in the eye and go fishing.</i>

01:16.676 --> 01:18.044
There he is.
We're on!

01:18.111 --> 01:20.046
Hell yeah!
Booyah!

01:20.113 --> 01:22.148
That's the meat!
Heartbreaking.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.416
Go, go, go, go!

01:23.483 --> 01:26.586
Keep going.
Just keep on going.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.290
<i>As the world looks

01:30.323 --> 01:32.425

01:32.492 --> 01:34.160
Stress level 20.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.696
<i>These fishermen
face the dead of winter.</i>

01:36.763 --> 01:38.765
It's kind of like
a horror film out here.

01:46.973 --> 01:49.576
Hold on!
Hold on!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.614
Going fishing!

01:56.049 --> 01:57.684
Whoa!

01:58.151 --> 02:00.620
Watch out!

02:03.723 --> 02:06.526
Please!

02:07.160 --> 02:09.162
Hit him!

02:10.730 --> 02:12.532
Stick him!

02:17.437 --> 02:18.104
Big boy!

02:18.171 --> 02:19.906
Big boy!

02:21.474 --> 02:24.177
Yeah!
Whoo!

02:24.277 --> 02:26.446
Bam!

02:26.813 --> 02:30.116
<i>This is
Outer Banks.</i>

02:38.291 --> 02:40.493
NICK
Let's get out there.
Everybody's gonna be going.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.128
It's been a little choppy,
but not too bad.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.230
I'm happy to be back out.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.865
So here we are.
We're headed out.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.767
Start of the season.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.771
This is the first year the
northern boats hadn't come.

02:51.838 --> 02:56.509
So basically every
boat we're competing
against is a local boat.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.012
So the competition is tight.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.414
We got Cliff and
Brandan returning with me,

03:01.481 --> 03:03.383
the best mates in the ocean.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.151
Last two years
that we've done it,

03:05.218 --> 03:06.519
we've done really well.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.322
We've finished second
twice, but this year,

03:09.422 --> 03:12.225
we'll be number one.

03:13.159 --> 03:16.596
GREG Let's show
'em how it's done, shall we?

03:16.696 --> 03:17.864
DIRTY
First morning.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.599
We're all a little
bit excited here.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.669
GREG Happy day.
Happy, happy day.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.805
It's wintertime,
it's bluefin season.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.807
We got to go.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.144
Not ideal, but hopefully,
we'll make it out here.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.880
It just won't be the prettiest
ride we've had before.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.083
That's why we wait
and we all go together.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.085
Little Shell is
right there ahead of us.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.688
I got Bed Bugs and Outlaw,
they're coming from Wanchese

03:41.721 --> 03:44.424
behind us and you don't
want to go around this place

03:44.457 --> 03:47.560
without any local knowledge
if you're not going with
somebody else,

03:47.627 --> 03:51.164
so get out here
and give it a whirl.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.272
NICK I'm nervous.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.574
I'm really watching all
of my system right now.

04:01.641 --> 04:05.745
My radar, my depth finder,
just hoping that we get out

04:05.812 --> 04:08.948
the Inlet unscathed.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.486
That's something the Offshore
Outlaw boys know all about.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.389
Little
says negative 1.5 foot.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.591
That is shallow!

04:18.658 --> 04:21.127
Just gonna go
with my gut feeling.

04:21.227 --> 04:22.328
I'm nervous.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.764
I'm always nervous navigating
through Oregon Inlet,

04:24.831 --> 04:27.467
especially the bridge.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.136
A couple of years
ago, we lost steering,

04:30.203 --> 04:32.505
hit the bridge.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.042
Water came pouring
in and the bow of the
boat was demolished.

04:36.142 --> 04:40.113
Luckily, everything was
fixable for the right price.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.483
I thought I might lose
the boat financially.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.418
Commercial fishing is the
hard way to make a living,

04:45.518 --> 04:47.887
but it's my passion.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.788
All right.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.790
Bobby coming up on
your port side here.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.060
He's coming with a
doggone mansion this year.

04:55.428 --> 04:58.331
BOBBY I'll
follow Outlaw and hope
the new boat makes it.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.333
I don't know why, man,
every time we start out,

05:00.366 --> 05:02.635
my nerves are just.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.271
This place is
just deadly, man.

05:06.172 --> 05:08.007
We have a new Reel E' Bugging
this year.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.076
The old boat was a 53 Hatteras.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.378
The new boat is a
60-foot Hatteras,

05:12.445 --> 05:14.447
it's a big jump,
there's a learning curve.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.283
It's massive.
It's a beast.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.353
(bleep), Adam, that's
all you got, eight knots?

05:20.386 --> 05:24.824
I'm gonna let
Bobby lead the way.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.659
Y'all better hold on.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.461
He kicks up a
little bit bigger swell.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.263
And we're getting
passed already.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.564
Hold on, Adam.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.032
Hold on.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.300
Here we go.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.302
Whoo! Yeah.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.174
She got a
whippin' current, man.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.278
If he makes it,
we know we're good.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.679
Yeah.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.747
All right, split 'em.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.583
All right, yup.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.586
That wasn't
as bad as it looked.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.955
All right.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.658
Here comes Rasta.

05:58.691 --> 06:02.662
Gonna buzz us. Woo!

06:02.695 --> 06:06.499
We got the
Outlaw beside of us.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.235
He waited to go across the
bar for some safe light.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.604
And we want to be safe too.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.140
We got families
to come home to.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.942
Hope them boys are bundled up.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.244
Oh, my God, can you
imagine how cold they are,

06:18.311 --> 06:20.413
31 degrees this morning.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.782
Oh, me.

06:23.783 --> 06:24.984
There they go.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.453
Man, if I had that
boat, I'd shoot right
straight through there.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.421
If you had that boat,

06:28.454 --> 06:31.324
we'd be knocking
icicles off our faces.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.062
Now, what, bro?

06:36.162 --> 06:37.330
Is that the bar or a boat?

06:37.363 --> 06:40.867
Where is the
freaking wreck though?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.102
NICK From the
bridge to the bar,

06:43.169 --> 06:45.104
it takes about
10 or 15 minutes.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.806
Complicating that now this year,

06:46.873 --> 06:50.276
there's an old steel wreck
from the '80s that the channel

06:50.376 --> 06:52.645
is narrowing towards.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.748
So you got about 75 yards from
shallow water with dangerous

06:55.815 --> 07:00.186
rough sea breaking, and then a
steel trawl boat that's been

07:00.253 --> 07:03.122
wrecked since the
'80s that you have to
kind of snake through.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.124
And it's, a couple boats have
hit that trawl boat already

07:05.191 --> 07:07.193
and it ends their season.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.929
It's not something
you're gonna fix overnight.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.266
If you're lucky, you
escape that with your life.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.368
Somebody got a
little guidance here?

07:15.401 --> 07:18.037
Do you know
where the wreck is?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.939
Yeah.
Where is it?

07:20.039 --> 07:21.574
<i>GREG Are you
following the buoys?</i>

07:21.674 --> 07:23.476
Is there
any buoys out here?

07:23.509 --> 07:25.211
Nope! All right.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.847
Hey, feel free to
share that with me.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.582
Which way should I be going?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.317
<i>GREG The wreck
will be on the west side.</i>

07:31.384 --> 07:32.785
<i>On the west side,
there's plenty of room.</i>

07:32.852 --> 07:34.020
Yeah.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.789
<i>GREG The
east side's fine, but you
got plenty of room now.</i>

07:36.856 --> 07:38.958
Where's east?
Where's east?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.029
There's Rasta?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.865
Who?
Rasta.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.435
Hey, Rasta,
you're gonna cut me off?

07:49.502 --> 07:50.670
Follow him.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.673
Yeah, but he
drafts 14 inches.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.775
<i>GREG Just about
abreast of the buoy now.</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:57.543
All right, where's
the poly ball, dude?

07:57.610 --> 07:58.611
Go ahead,
I'll look through it.

07:58.711 --> 07:59.712
<i>GREG Just coming
past it now.</i>

07:59.812 --> 08:01.347
There it is.
Where?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.416
Right over there. 10:00.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.885
Oh, that's a
little ass poly ball, bro.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.986
I'm good though.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.087
Yeah, you're good.
You're good.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.257
me, dude.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.467
At least we
got to worry about one
thing and that's the bar.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.537
ERIC
Welcome to Oregon Inlet.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.173
ADAM
The worst part about
this place is the bar.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.109
If you hit it wrong, it
could tear your boat up.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.478
You bust your windows out.
It's just dangerous.

08:32.545 --> 08:34.380
All right, boys here we go.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.983
Hold on.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.992
Hold on, guys.
Breaker. Yeah.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.763
Hold on.

08:50.863 --> 08:55.134
Yeah, boys!
We're out, boys.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.571
Yeah!
We are back, baby.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.772
Woo, if that
don't get your heart going

08:59.872 --> 09:02.775
first second in the morning,
I don't know what will.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.524
Rigging a ballyhoo
is like skinning a cat.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.860
Say everybody
does this different.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.429
A lot of folks down here
use ballyhoo as baits because

09:23.529 --> 09:24.897
they're long and skinny.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.799
They'll actually swim
like they're alive.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.501
Them tunas just
can't resist it.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.770
I've got two of the best
mates in the business on here.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.505
I've got Billon Hollingsworth.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.340
There's a
little bit of an art to it.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.810
And Jason Futch,
AKA Dirty Jay.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.079
Burr, my
hands are frozen.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.781
They got a
great work ethic.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.649
No matter when I say
we're going fishing,

09:43.716 --> 09:44.984
they're ready to go.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.454
It's really good to have two
mates that I can depend on.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.556
See what we got.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.891
GREG
First day out.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.559
Nobody knows where
the fish are feeding.

09:53.626 --> 09:57.263
So we're all spread
out looking for them.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.800
Hey!
I got birds up here.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.268
Let's get baits.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.936
These are ballyhoos.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.838
GREG You know,
it didn't make any sense to
go to one spot.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.908
We got 20 miles of boats
looking for these fish.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.444
Nailed it, Drew!
You nailed it.

10:11.477 --> 10:15.281
We are set up, dudes.
Let's do it.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.650
BRIAN
Bluefin or bust.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.453
GREG All of us are
looking for the gold rush,

10:20.486 --> 10:21.954
the Gulf Stream.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.824
The Gulf Stream is
basically an offshore river.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.226
The water is heated down in
the Gulf of Mexico and it

10:27.293 --> 10:28.861
wants to go north.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.963
It goes to where
the cold water is.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.566
Look, look, look.
Look right there.

10:33.599 --> 10:37.503
Good God!

10:37.603 --> 10:40.506
GREG And it
carries its own life cycle.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.042
There's all kinds of bait,
fish, birds, mammals

10:43.109 --> 10:45.244
that all follow the stream.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.679
Where's
the bluefin, Chopper?

10:49.115 --> 10:51.417
DANIEL
Back on the ground.

10:51.517 --> 10:54.787
Put something
in the water they may
have not seen before.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.889
GREG The Gulf
Stream influences everything.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.691
It's the lifeblood
of our fishing here.

10:58.791 --> 11:02.528
Everybody's just kind of
searching for that first fish.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.597
BILLON
We are fishing.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.966
GREG
I'm ready to get a bite.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.334
We're all out here to
trying to make a living.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.236
We're trying make
money, but we're fishing.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.604
We're always competing.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.373
And I always considered
Nick my top competition.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.075
He's pushing to
get that first fish.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.811
He wants to prove something.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.015
Where's the Little Shell?

11:24.283 --> 11:27.553
CLIFF
Little Shell's coming for you.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.355
Opening day of the season.

11:29.388 --> 11:33.192
If we catch a fish early
this morning and get one
first again this year,

11:33.292 --> 11:35.027
it'll definitely
give my guys a boost.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.096
We're gonna get 'em.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.465
NICK The market on
bluefin tuna has steadily been

11:39.565 --> 11:41.634
declining over
the last few years.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.936
And now this pandemic has
hit and they're not shipping

11:44.003 --> 11:46.405
things overseas
like they did before.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.641
Oh boy, we're
gonna get a bite.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.644
And my worst fear is to make
the least amount of money for

11:51.677 --> 11:53.679
my two guys and me.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.281
You know, I have
grown man bills.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.383
Mortgage, I have
a little girl.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.585
And then Cliff and
Brandan have all the same,

11:59.652 --> 12:02.021
three times multiplied.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.923
What the is that?

12:03.956 --> 12:04.924
What is that?

12:04.957 --> 12:06.058
What's that
sound, Brandan?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.560
Let me see.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.228
This is not good.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.764
I'll get
down there and look.

12:11.864 --> 12:12.598
(bleep), dude.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.133
We suck?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.969
The boat didn't
get used in the last what,
a month and a half.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.406
I'm gonna tell you
right now that's steering.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.877
We are pouring fluid out.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.580
We got a steering leak.

12:27.613 --> 12:28.881
Right here.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.450
What are you thinking?

12:31.717 --> 12:33.519
There's nothing we
can do, now. We gotta go in.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.355
We got to take what fluid
we got and got to go in.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.958
I just need to know
if I can start heading west.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.159
Yes.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.827
Secure your deck, Brandan.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.731
NICK This is gonna
cost us money and time,

12:45.798 --> 12:48.100
both of things we
can't afford to give up.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.336
Not being able to fish on day
one of the season because of

12:50.369 --> 12:53.439
mechanical issues, it
makes me pissed off.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.341
Terrible start to our season.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.644
You know, we're
out here to earn money
because we need it.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.813
And well, just bad luck.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.815
Just part of, part
of being on a boat.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.484
Part of working with
boats, they break.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.486
It breaks my heart to go
in there without a fish.

13:07.553 --> 13:11.390
But best thing to do
is to go in right now.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.292
Damn it.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.928
I really wanted
that first fish.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.569
There's a
few marks here.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.871
Hopefully we'll get a
bite here any minute.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.409
Hey!
Wolf pack!

13:31.210 --> 13:33.279
I have not marked any.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.648
That doesn't mean
they're not here.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.949
We got the lines out.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.417
You got to put us on the fish.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.852
Don't want
to stay tonight.

13:39.885 --> 13:40.853
No.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.589
Look.
Marking 'em.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.591
Come on, Minnie, do
the thing for us.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.493
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.495
That'll
be the lucky one.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.965
Boys, bluefin season's
officially started now.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.501
We are in
the right spot.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.502
Come to papa.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.703
We've got high hopes.

13:57.803 --> 14:01.307
Come on tune.
It's gonna happen, guys.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.610
There he is.
There he is, Drew.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.779
There he is.
Meat. All right.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.881
Tight, boys!
There he is.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.783
We're tight!
There he is.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.451
Yeah, son!

14:12.518 --> 14:13.619
Drew, you want to
move it to there?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.920
Yeah.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.256
All right, let's go.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.724
All right, there she is.

14:18.791 --> 14:24.530
All right, boys.
yeah.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.266
Yo, we're tight.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.901
<i>BOBBY
Yeah. We're tight.</i>

14:28.934 --> 14:30.903
Bobby is
hooked up right now.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.005
He's just to the
north of us a little bit.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.274
We are working our way
that direction.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.011
Good for Buggings.
Waiting our turn.

14:39.078 --> 14:42.381
Okay.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.085
Really, Greg?
You got to get a bite here.

14:46.752 --> 14:50.489
Now, let's
make sure we don't suck.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.092
Booyah!
Let's go, boys.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.127
It's tuna weather right here.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.395
He's down and tight.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.398
Good?
Yeah, that's good.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.034
Starting to blow.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.203
I don't like that
lines whipping up in the.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.404
Yeah, let's
shorten the leash.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.238
I'm ready, dude.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.840
See how that thing's
flapping around?

15:07.873 --> 15:10.109
Yeah, he's coming
to the surface, dude.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.243
See him way out there.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.244
Yeah.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.479
He's coming up, Bobby.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.948
All right, we're
coming to him right now.

15:16.048 --> 15:19.051
Let's dance.
Let's dance.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.320
He's all on the top.
Come on, Brian.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.123
He's all on the top.
Kick his ass country.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.891
Might be like
tail wrapped or something.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.893
It might be.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.229
He's acting real weird.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.431
It's a critical
part of the fish fight.

15:32.498 --> 15:33.799
We got the fish up and down.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.702
You know, first
fish of the year.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.004
This is where things
get dicey, you know,

15:39.071 --> 15:42.074
you just, you got to pucker
up and focus right now.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.809
Until you stick him.

15:43.909 --> 15:47.012
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

15:48.547 --> 15:49.515
Spin left, Bobby.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.416
Come up.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.617
I will.
You get us straight,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.520
I'll come up.
We got color.

15:54.553 --> 15:55.921
Nice long fish.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.022
All right, Drew.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.357
Hurry up.
Get up there.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.426
He's right there.
Hurry up.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.560
Where is he, bro?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.928
He's right here, Bobby.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.097
I lost
him in the waves.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.833
Right here.
Right there!

16:09.001 --> 16:11.370
Booyah!

16:11.437 --> 16:12.938
Get a gaff on him.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.473
He ain't done.
He ain't done, dude.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.908
Let him go.
Let him go.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.576
Whoa, he's
swimming, dude.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.911
Big wave.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.213
Hold on!

16:21.947 --> 16:24.016
That harpoon line
is rubbing on this line.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.317
I can feel it.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.485
No

16:26.552 --> 16:27.853
Grab it on the
other side of the leader.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.388
Grab the harpoon line.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.023
Watch this line
right here, Bobby.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.591
There we go, bro.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.559
Get ready.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.661
When I hit him with a gaff,
he's gonna go nuts.

16:35.761 --> 16:36.762
Come on.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.964
We're gonna lose
this fish, bro.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.233
BRIAN He just
came off. He's gone!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.502
Yeah, he's gone, bro!

16:57.049 --> 16:58.851
That harpoon line
is rubbing on this line.

16:58.884 --> 16:59.985
I can feel it.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.087
No
Here we go, bro.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.255
Get ready when I
hit him a gaff,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.524
he's gonna go nuts.

17:05.591 --> 17:06.592
Come on.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.527
We're gonna lose
this fish, bro.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.995
He just came off.

17:10.062 --> 17:11.063
He's gone.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.999
Just handline him.
Help me move this.

17:14.066 --> 17:15.434
I'm gonna
help you out, Bri.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.902
Bro, we're about to
lose this fish, dude.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.903
I know.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.271
And we've had
100 chances to get him.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.873
I know. Right.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.107
It's
amateur hour.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.375
Brian, I
can't see that line.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.443
Where is it?

17:24.510 --> 17:29.281
Little bump,
little bump. Ah!

17:31.283 --> 17:32.451
We're handlining, dude.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.386
Oh, we got a
mess going on here, dude.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.654
Just don't
get caught in here.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.823
Yeah, that's
what I was worried about.

17:37.890 --> 17:42.094
Ah. Ah.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.470
There he is. Color.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.039
Captain Drew.
Yeah.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.308
Put a tail
wrap on this fish.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.643
I'm going over.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.411
Get another
harpoon, pull that.

17:59.478 --> 18:03.015
Grab a gaff.
Tie that off.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.050
Drew, today, bro.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.753
Yeah, sometime today.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.955
Just grab that,
I love you, man.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.857
Oh my God, bro.
There you go.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.060
All right.
Cinch him up.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.328
yeah.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.497
Wow, that feels good.
Bed Bugs!

18:18.564 --> 18:22.067
Yeah, buddy!
It wasn't pretty.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.570
I got to tell
you, it feels amazing.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.971
First fish of the year.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.773
Typical bedbug style.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.777
It was a demon fish, 25 things
could have went wrong there,

18:31.810 --> 18:34.246
22 of them did.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.617
<i>BOBBY We got the
first fish. We're back.</i>

18:38.684 --> 18:41.453
The champ.
Yeah.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.056
Coming back
to get his crown.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.992
It appears
Bobby's got the first fish.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.795
I guess the tuna gods were
on his side this morning.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.164
Good for him, bad for us.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.066
I really wanted
that first fish.

18:54.099 --> 18:56.902
Bobby struck first.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.804
That might be a lucky boat.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.106
All right.
Well, let's get him in, Bobby.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.443
BOBBY
We legally can't keep a
bluefin less than 73 inches.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.012
Because at that point they
would have had a chance to

19:07.079 --> 19:09.381
spawn and make more bluefin.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.016
That's a fatty, bro.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.851
BOBBY
Luckily we don't have a
problem with this fish.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.386
You ready?

19:14.453 --> 19:15.487
Yeah.

19:15.554 --> 19:16.989
96 inches.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.291
Yeah, Brian.
You got it, buddy.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.660
Oh, baby.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.936
NICK We're behind
the game right now,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.938
so we just need to get
everything finished,

19:33.038 --> 19:34.840
and then take off.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.308
CLIFF We ain't
caught nothing but hell.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.143
Everything has
been fighting us.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.313
Gonna fix this steering
and we'll get back out there.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.783
I don't want to
be behind everybody.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.518
This is not what we do.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.654
Last year, we had 15.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.756
Bobby Bugging Bed Bugs had
five and he's bragging about

19:50.789 --> 19:51.957
catching one.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.258
Is he?

19:53.325 --> 19:54.693
So, he,
damn right he is.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.861
You know him.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.496
Yeah, that sucks.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.064
It's early
and it's one fish,

19:59.131 --> 20:01.700
but, you know, it
hurts me right here,

20:01.800 --> 20:04.703
my heart, my pride.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.606
We're gonna fix it up
and we're gonna do what we do,

20:07.673 --> 20:08.907
we're gonna catch fish.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.243
We're gonna end up on top
and that's just the way it is.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.612
You know
what boat stands for?

20:13.712 --> 20:15.981
Yeah, "Bust. Out.
Another. Thousand."

20:16.081 --> 20:17.149
That's exactly right.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.251
All right, guys.
I got to hurry up.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.453
We got to get out there.
The guys are all fishing.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.688
BRANDAN
We're working on it, Cap.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.357
NICK All right,
just do what you can.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.463
Yeah, that's the
Doghouse right there.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.799
BRITTON
Yo, frenzy!

20:33.832 --> 20:35.634
GREG Shack is
always someone who,

20:35.701 --> 20:38.070
he's been out here
every year with us.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.838
You know, most days that
we're out here fishing,

20:39.905 --> 20:41.273
Shack is here.

20:41.306 --> 20:43.008
So he pays
attention to detail.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.576
He knows where to be.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.545
He knows where the
fish are moving.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.548
He's a good fisherman.

20:49.848 --> 20:50.916
BRITTON
Feels good.

20:50.949 --> 20:52.918
Start of the season.
We're ready.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.953
Time to go fishing.
You're ready?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.455
Yeah, I'm ready.

20:56.488 --> 21:00.025
Getting everything set up
to deploy the bird and start.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.860
I'm excited.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.396
Been sitting around
the house way too long.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.731
BRITTON I'm
Britton Shackelford,

21:05.764 --> 21:07.399
captain and owner
of the Doghouse.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.034
I've got a brand
new crew this year.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.969
Bo has fished for a long time.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.038
Multi-different
species of fish,

21:13.138 --> 21:15.941
very, very observant.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.311
Catlin comes from a
long line of fishermen.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.114
I am jacked up.
Hopefully today is the day.

21:22.147 --> 21:24.049
Today's the day.

21:24.149 --> 21:28.754
BRITTON
Me getting to know them is
vital for me to be successful.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.157
That's the bird that
keeps everything tight.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.694
And once we hook the
stick to it, it'll lift it up.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.897
Bo has not fished
with the stick and Catlin has

21:38.964 --> 21:42.634
never done it, so we got the
stick out just so they can

21:42.701 --> 21:44.970
kind of get
acclimated with that.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.639
BRITTON Down here
in the South, the bluefin are
constantly moving,

21:47.706 --> 21:49.975
looking for bait near
the surface of the water.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.978
So a lot captains troll with
the green stick to keep the

21:53.011 --> 21:54.980
baits up high.

21:55.013 --> 22:00.285
The stick has got a really
heavy what we call the bird,

22:00.352 --> 22:03.922
that keeps tension on
this main line coming
off of this bandit.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.091
And this line
that comes from the top of...

22:06.191 --> 22:07.993
the stick connects
to that bandit...

22:08.026 --> 22:11.630
and pulls the baits up so all
your baits are just dangling.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.000
These are the drops.
We got five of them.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.836
They're just squids with hooks
in them and they dangle and

22:17.936 --> 22:20.739
hop across the
top of the water.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.809
Hopefully that's
what the tuna grab.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.377
Man, it'd
be cool to get one.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.813
Yeah.
My bank account would like it.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.282
BRITTON Keep
your eyes open now.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.286
GREG Man,
this is unbelievable.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.755
We are really sucking.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.957
I'm just gonna keep working up
to the northeast and hopefully

22:39.024 --> 22:42.594
find some water, warmer water
and maybe find some fish.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.963
Bobby's bite was
in warmer water.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.766
And right now, that's
all the info we have,

22:47.833 --> 22:50.702
so we're gonna ride around
here and see what we can find.

22:51.069 --> 22:51.970
Hurry up and wait.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.338
That's the name of it.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.340
GREG There's a
bubble of warmer water there.

22:55.407 --> 22:56.508
It's something.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.511
I just want one.
I just want one.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.680
Come on, baby.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.617
Single mark at 12 fathom.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.787
All right.
Come on, baby!

23:11.523 --> 23:13.792
We're on!
Yeah, baby!

23:13.892 --> 23:16.695
We're on!
We are on.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.997
All right,
finally got us a bite.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.432
Feels like a good one.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.434
GREG I know
Bed Bugs caught a fish,

23:22.534 --> 23:24.803
he's down about
ten miles below us.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.739
Guys, I would really
hate to lose to Bobby,

23:27.806 --> 23:29.441
so let's start
this season right.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.809
Okay, cool.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.244
It's like riding a bike.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.346
You can get in
the corner if you want.

23:34.379 --> 23:36.548
GREG Bobby
won one year in a row.

23:36.615 --> 23:39.885
Hey, for four seasons, I
was the top boat down here.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.454
I'm always right there.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.089
It's all right,
nice and easy.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.357
Take your time.

23:45.390 --> 23:46.658
GREG I got
a reputation to uphold.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.293
People are always
looking at the red boat.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.561
They want to know
where I'm going.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.129
They want to know
what I'm catching.

23:51.196 --> 23:54.032
He's not very far away right
now, but he's up high.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.667
A lot of times, big
fish will do that.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.002
They'll stay up high.

23:57.035 --> 23:59.004
Big fish don't
get smart from being dumb.

23:59.037 --> 24:00.572
Dumb fish don't live long.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.908
GREG No.
This year's no different.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.510
Now, I've got a bunch of local
guys I got to deal with and

24:05.577 --> 24:08.213
we're all on a level
playing field now,

24:08.313 --> 24:09.481
it's our backyard.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.783
Down and dirty right now,
just how we like it.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.118
Let him fight that rod.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.053
The bend of that
rod wears him out.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.221
Yo-yoing, baby.

24:16.688 --> 24:18.323
GREG So
I want to catch fish.

24:18.423 --> 24:19.958
I want to make some
money for my crew.

24:20.058 --> 24:23.295
But above all, I want
to be the top boat at
the end of the season.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.765
There he is. Boom.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.700
GREG I want to
make sure everyone knows that

24:28.767 --> 24:31.870
the Fishin' Frenzy is the top
boat in the Outer Banks.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.238
Might get a shot here.

24:33.338 --> 24:34.973
Come on.
Come over here.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.141
There you go.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.943
This fish is crazy.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.312
Hold on. Hold on.
He's going deep.

24:40.345 --> 24:41.613
He's mad!

24:46.084 --> 24:47.619
Nice lovely headshot.

24:47.719 --> 24:50.789
Come on, baby.
This fish is crazy!

24:50.822 --> 24:52.991
Ah, come on.
Come over here.

24:53.091 --> 24:56.728
There we go.
Hold on. Hold on.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.263
He's going deep.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.098
He's mad.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.700
Come over this way.
Pull, pull, pull, pull!

25:01.733 --> 25:02.901
I'm pulling on him.
I'm pulling.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.469
That's right.
Okay, got him.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.370
To my left. The left.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.838
To my left.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.574
That's the way
we like it, boys!

25:09.641 --> 25:11.910
That's how you do it.
Way to start the season.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.345
That's the way to start.
One for one.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.579
Right out of the gate.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.014
Hell yeah, that's
a beautiful fish.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.082
GREG
The team's clicking.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.850
Everything's
going our way so far.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.452
I hope it continues.

25:20.485 --> 25:22.020
Very nice-shaped fish.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.555
Yeah, I like that.
That's nice.

25:23.588 --> 25:24.856
92.

25:24.923 --> 25:26.658
What a way
to do it, dude.

25:26.758 --> 25:27.993
That's the way
to start the season.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.028
I like it, I like it, I like it.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.197
You like it,
we like it, sensei.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.567
<i>GREG
Heading to the west.</i>

25:39.504 --> 25:41.239
I was watching.
Good going.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.308
Looked like a right
nice one from here.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.377
But then again, we're still
technically...

25:45.410 --> 25:46.778
tied until you get
to the dock.

25:47.412 --> 25:48.680
That's right.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.949
I fished with little Jimmie's
dad before he was born.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.953
Kind of funny to think I've
been doing it for that long.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.621
JIMMIE I want to
sack these guys up.

25:56.688 --> 25:58.857
Young guns.
Here we go.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.159
GREG But
Big Jim has pretty much
retired and Jimmie's

26:01.226 --> 26:03.395
started running the
boat a couple years ago.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.964
And Jimmie's got
a big fast boat.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.432
Faster than my boat.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.334
Jimmie's gonna be
tough to deal with.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.436
We've definitely got
something to prove this year

26:11.536 --> 26:13.238
being the young
guns in the fleet.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.073
I know we can do it, we just
need to prove that we can do

26:15.140 --> 26:17.042
it by doing it.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.710
Put us on
the meat, Jimmie.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.445
I'll try.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.514
JIMMIE
I'm Jimmie Horning.
I'm captain of the Hog Wild.

26:22.547 --> 26:23.915
I'm 22 years old.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.183
Born and raised here
on the Outer Banks.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.252
And fishing is what I do.

26:27.285 --> 26:28.620
It's what I grew up doing.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.821
It's what I've always done.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.289
It's the only thing
I know how to do.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.557
It's what I love.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.559
I love everything about it and
it's just what I've always done.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.461
It's my life.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.563
I'm getting wet.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.365
My mates,
I've got Trey and Ellis.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.267
Take me a minute
to get my sea legs back,

26:42.300 --> 26:43.935
get back in the
groove of things.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.203
Ellis is a
great fisherman,

26:45.270 --> 26:46.738
I've known him for a while.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.206
You like my pet chicken?

26:48.273 --> 26:50.075
And Trey, he's been
fishing with me ever since I

26:50.108 --> 26:52.377
started running the
boat five years ago.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.846
The advantage of being
young is we're all full of

26:54.946 --> 26:57.282
piss and vinegar.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.688
Catching some tuna.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.290
Here, fishy, fishy.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.502
Man, did it get cold.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.104
Yeah, it did.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.706
I think I got
frostbite and my toes fell off.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.676
SHANE We
have to be tough to deal
with big oceans all the

27:24.776 --> 27:27.779
time, rain, 30-degree weather.

27:28.780 --> 27:31.149
I'm so cold right
now I can barely talk.

27:32.684 --> 27:33.785
SHANE
This is what we do.

27:33.885 --> 27:35.120
This is how we
make a paycheck.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.322
100% of our income comes
from commercial fishing.

27:39.524 --> 27:42.961
Be nice to catch one,
we could end it and go home.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.008
Wow, that came up fast.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.644
Wow, 7 foot, 6 foot.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.647
This place will give you
a flipping heart attack, man.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.283
Five-eight.

28:07.085 --> 28:10.255
It was a rough year for me
personally in regards to

28:10.288 --> 28:13.191
my boat, you know.

28:13.258 --> 28:16.361
We were heading down to the
Outer Banks early October.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.996
I was moving down here.

28:18.029 --> 28:21.766
We had everything onboard.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.635
I had 30 years'
worth of tackle.

28:23.668 --> 28:26.671
I had 28 fishing
rods and reels.

28:26.738 --> 28:30.108
And the boat caught fire.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.677
Fired up the mayday.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.579
Threw down some
survival suits.

28:34.646 --> 28:37.115
And we got in and we
worked our way to the bow.

28:37.215 --> 28:40.018
You know, by the time we threw
the life raft off the bow,

28:40.051 --> 28:42.687
the entire boat was ablaze.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.492
BOBBY We were
40 miles offshore and

28:47.592 --> 28:51.963
from the first time I smelt
smoke to jumping in a life raft

28:52.030 --> 28:54.599
was about 12 minutes.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.669
After you get pulled out of
the water in a helicopter,

28:57.702 --> 29:00.405
you're soaking wet
and it's all gone.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.941
And, you know, we
were in New Jersey in a,

29:02.974 --> 29:07.045
in a private
airport with no shoes,

29:07.078 --> 29:11.449
no money, no cell phones
and you just can't digest it.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.052
Devastating.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.354
I mean, last year
was just awful.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.091
So catching the first fish
this season is a godsend.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.962
<i>♪ I've got the gold
in my hands</i> ♪

29:23.995 --> 29:26.231
<i>Second place will never do ♪</i>♪

29:26.264 --> 29:27.832
Get ready.
How was your day?

29:27.899 --> 29:28.900
Epic.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.968
Congratulations on the first fish.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.369
It's a demon fish.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.537
Why don't we come
take a look at him?

29:32.637 --> 29:33.538
Let's do it.

29:33.638 --> 29:34.472
<i>♪ I want the power
and the glory</i> ♪

29:34.539 --> 29:35.974
<i>And it ain’t no sin ♪</i>

29:36.007 --> 29:37.542
<i>I’m the new sensation ♪</i>

29:37.642 --> 29:40.445
<i>Came to win, win, win ♪</i>♪

29:40.478 --> 29:42.113
Dennis,
what does she weigh?

29:42.180 --> 29:44.449
477 pounds, guys.

29:44.549 --> 29:45.617
Oh!
Yeah!

29:45.650 --> 29:46.751
Yeah.
Yeah! We knew it.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.853
We knew it, bro.
We knew it.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.921
We knew it
was a big fish.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.122
We knew.
We needed that.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.257
Let's go see
how it grades out.

29:52.290 --> 29:52.991
Yes.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.260
Can't wait
to see it, Dennis.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.199
Well, you guys
are off to a really
good start this year.

30:01.266 --> 30:05.303
BOBBY The buyer's
looking for a tail sample with
a thick band of fat

30:05.370 --> 30:09.741
just below the skin and marbled
fat clearly visible in the meat.

30:09.774 --> 30:11.209
It's like butter,
the meat in there.

30:11.276 --> 30:12.744
It's all loaded up
with fat in there,

30:12.777 --> 30:13.878
you can see that.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.213
Oh yeah look at that.
Yeah.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.948
Well let's see what
the core color looks like.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.851
Come on, baby.

30:20.218 --> 30:23.221
BOBBY And
in the core sample taken
deep within the tuna,

30:23.288 --> 30:25.323
the buyer's looking for a
consistent red color

30:25.390 --> 30:28.660
that's also shiny
and translucent.

30:28.693 --> 30:31.229
Well, it does look
like there's a little meat burn.

30:31.296 --> 30:34.232
You can see the tail is nice
and red but the core sample is

30:34.332 --> 30:36.401
kind of cloudy and opaque.

30:36.434 --> 30:38.503
You know, the
restaurant business is shaky.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.338
The market's very fragile.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.974
And the customers, they
don't want to take a fish
that they can't sell.

30:43.074 --> 30:45.076
What's the
best you can do?

30:49.814 --> 30:51.549
I can pay you
$7 a pound tonight.

30:51.616 --> 30:52.984
All right.
We'll take that.

30:53.051 --> 30:53.918
We'll take it.
Yeah.

30:53.985 --> 30:54.986
We'll take it.
First ones on the board.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.087
Every dollar counts.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.422
All right, look,
I'm not happy with it,
but we'll take it.

30:57.455 --> 30:58.623
We need it all.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.691
Thank you, Dennis.
Good luck.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.726
All right,
Dennis, be well.

31:01.826 --> 31:03.061
All right,
let's get another one.

31:03.094 --> 31:04.696
Yeah, man.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.202
Well, he pressed
start new track this morning,

31:11.269 --> 31:12.470
so it should saved it.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.373
It should be
showing everything.

31:15.473 --> 31:18.943
We was on our way in
and we have a track line that...

31:19.010 --> 31:22.213
saves on our GPS
everyday that we go out.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.949
And this is the first time
we've been out of the Inlet...

31:25.016 --> 31:28.753
this year and for some reason,
our track line hasn't saved.

31:29.754 --> 31:33.391
It just deleted it.
We're pretty much stuck.

31:34.492 --> 31:37.462
The new way that we got to
come in and out of the bar...

31:37.495 --> 31:41.566
there's a big shipwreck right
there and it's pretty dicey.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.569
And we don't want to bust
in there in the dark and...

31:44.602 --> 31:46.037
not know where we're at.

31:46.604 --> 31:50.308
I have a chance of hitting
that wreck and sink and...

31:50.408 --> 31:55.313
possibly, you know, possibly
lose our life or something.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.315
We don't want to do that.

32:00.685 --> 32:03.521
ZACK We're gonna
need some help if we're gonna
make it through the night.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.424
How about the
Outlaw, you on this one?

32:08.059 --> 32:10.261
Because it's thirty degrees out
here and we are...

32:10.328 --> 32:12.263
layered up to the tee.

32:12.330 --> 32:16.434
We got about ten more hours
until the sun comes up.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.170
Yeah, come on, Adam...

32:25.410 --> 32:27.445
You standing by, Adam?

32:37.422 --> 32:39.891
ZACK
It's gonna be a long night
on the Rasta Rocket.

32:45.196 --> 32:48.299
ZACK How about the
Outlaw, you on this one?

32:50.535 --> 32:53.371
It's gonna be along night on
the Rasta Rocket because it's

32:53.438 --> 32:56.474
30 degrees out here and
we're pretty much stuck.

32:56.574 --> 33:00.011
And we got about 10 more
hours until the sun comes up.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.813
Yeah, come on, Adam.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.583
<i>ADAM Yeah,
I'm standing by.</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:07.318
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:07.385 --> 33:08.853
Our plot line deleted.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.755
I guess we are gonna stay.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.191
You got an extra towel
on there maybe?

33:13.224 --> 33:15.560
You don't have
any blankets or anything?

33:15.593 --> 33:18.329
I got one
that the dog is in.

33:19.063 --> 33:21.332
She's
pissed off right now.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.035
I got two blankets,
a sleeping bag,

33:24.068 --> 33:25.336
a towel, and a beanbag.

33:25.403 --> 33:26.070
<i>ZACK Sure.</i>

33:26.137 --> 33:27.605
You're all life savers.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.243
We're idling over
here to the Outlaw.

33:32.977 --> 33:34.412
ZACK They're
gonna help us out.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.847
That's how we do
it in the South.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.682
No man left behind.

33:37.782 --> 33:39.150
That's got
to be him right there.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.085
That bright
light coming toward us?

33:42.720 --> 33:46.991
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.695
These are nice and warm.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.897
Just came out the dryer.

33:52.997 --> 33:54.732
All right. Ready,
here's the towel.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.235
Thank you.
Appreciate y'all.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.971
This is going to be
one we ain't going to forget.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.340
All right, fellas.
Appreciate it.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.374
Thank you.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.009
If y'all
get too bad off now,
let us know.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.278
All right.
Burr!

34:08.813 --> 34:11.282
Outlaw saves the day.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.759
GREG First
day of the season. We're
coming in with the meat.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.194
It feels good.

34:23.294 --> 34:24.262
Dennis!

34:24.295 --> 34:26.731
I was really hoping we'd set
the tone with the first fish,

34:26.764 --> 34:28.199
but we got number two.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.400
Well, let's
see what you got.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.302
All right, cool.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.271
Our first trip out,
we got a fish,

34:33.304 --> 34:35.106
but we were just a
little bit late.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.041
But anything we can
get on the market now,

34:37.108 --> 34:39.744
there's not much there, so
it's gonna be worth some money.

34:39.777 --> 34:40.945
What kind of weight we got?

34:41.045 --> 34:42.780
404 pounds dressed, guys.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.216
I love that.
For a 92 incher!

34:45.283 --> 34:47.318
That is the ones
we're looking for.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.286
Hell yeah.

34:48.319 --> 34:49.387
So let's see
what the color is like.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.789
All right.
Sounds good to me.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.332
Not a bad specimen for
your first fish of the season.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.700
We like to hear that.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.969
Right now I'm seeing
some pretty nice red tail color.

35:05.069 --> 35:07.071
It's not jammed,
jammed up with fat,

35:07.138 --> 35:09.807
but I'm hoping a nice red core
here will get you a good price.

35:09.874 --> 35:13.511
Let's see what we got.
Oh yeah, there we go.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.979
Drumroll, please.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.248
It's
actually really clear.

35:17.315 --> 35:18.249
So what do you think?

35:18.316 --> 35:20.351
I mean, what kind of
price we got on here?

35:20.418 --> 35:22.453
I wish it
had a little more fat,

35:22.520 --> 35:25.056
but it's a decent fish
for our New York market.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.624
$8 a pound.

35:26.724 --> 35:29.260
Hey you know something?
Three grand.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.429
A lot of boats out there
that aren't getting paid.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.263
Yeah.
That's true.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.065
I'm happy to have it.
Yeah. Me, too.

35:34.098 --> 35:35.433
Alright. That's good,
Dennis. Thank you.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.467
We'll see in you
in the morning.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.735
Sounds good.
Thank you.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.470
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.639
It doesn't make a
difference who's got the first,

35:41.739 --> 35:43.808
it's who's got the
most at the end of the year.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.010
That's what
we're shooting for.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.919
Night fishing is awesome.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.020
If you're night fishing,

35:56.120 --> 35:57.755
that means you didn't
catch one during the day,

35:57.822 --> 35:59.924
so you're stuck out
here all damn day.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.660
And all night.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.766
All right.
We did a good deed.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.569
So maybe the tuna
gods will respect that.

36:11.669 --> 36:15.406
Maybe we'll get paid
back for trying to do good.

36:16.407 --> 36:19.944
What is it, Chopper?
Smell them tuna fish?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.785
Awfully long day.

36:27.852 --> 36:31.055
We really need to get us
a bite because we need
to get on the board.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.590
We can't be falling behind.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.791
I like night fishing.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.494
I don't mind
staying night out here.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.764
Getting rigged
up with Boston Mackerel
for fishing tonight.

36:39.797 --> 36:43.334
We're gonna drift these
baits along all night, you know.

36:43.401 --> 36:46.337
Maybe some of these
fish will feed at night.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.806
Sometimes it's a little bit
better at night drifting.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.076
We're here so we'll
see what happens.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.178
We're just some young kids
out here trying to prove that

36:54.245 --> 36:55.546
we've got what it takes.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.081
So if that means staying out
here all night then that's

36:57.181 --> 36:58.783
what we're gonna do.

36:58.816 --> 37:01.552
Give him a kiss
before you send him off.

37:01.619 --> 37:05.056
That's nasty.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.259
JIMMIE We're only
allowed one fish per day.

37:08.359 --> 37:10.061
If we bring the fish
in after midnight,

37:10.094 --> 37:12.563
that prevents us from fishing
that following day because

37:12.630 --> 37:14.799
technically that fish
was landed on that day.

37:14.832 --> 37:17.535
So say we were to catch
a fish at 9:00 at night,

37:17.568 --> 37:19.003
we could hurry up,
get in here,

37:19.103 --> 37:20.805
get our fish
offloaded before midnight.

37:20.838 --> 37:23.007
That still leaves us
open to fish the next day.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.909
Every single fish counts.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.550
I'm about
to fall asleep.

37:38.556 --> 37:40.658
Where'd all
the big tunas go?

37:40.725 --> 37:44.095
Where did they go, Trey?

37:44.962 --> 37:47.131
We're gonna
get one, Choppy boy.

37:50.234 --> 37:51.869
Oh, there's a mark.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.205
Hey, hey, hey!
There he is! There he is!

37:54.238 --> 37:55.740
There he is!
There he is!

37:55.773 --> 37:56.841
We're hooked up!

37:56.874 --> 37:58.509
Crank it! Crank it!
Crank it! Crank it!

37:58.576 --> 38:01.145
All right, boys.
All right, got him on.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.147
Hooked up, baby.
We got one on.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.249
Let's make it count here.

38:05.316 --> 38:06.617
All right.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.252
This could be the right one.

38:08.319 --> 38:09.620
Where you want to go?

38:09.687 --> 38:11.055
I wanna put
over on that side.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.323
You ready?

38:12.356 --> 38:13.791
Yup.

38:13.891 --> 38:16.427
Oh boy, I love
those wake up calls.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.328
Right here?

38:17.361 --> 38:19.530
No, right behind you.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.332
There you go. All right.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.700
All right, we
got our night bite.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.069
Let's make it count.

38:25.903 --> 38:27.772
It's starting
to become a really long night.

38:27.805 --> 38:28.606
Yeah.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.979
Huh?
Hey, hey, hey.

38:35.012 --> 38:38.349
There he is.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.819
Adam! Adam! Fish on!

38:43.554 --> 38:45.790
That the right one?
I think so.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.725
Come on, be the one.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.160
Be the one.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.361
Got something on.

38:50.461 --> 38:53.030
Rod ain't bent very much.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.299
Damn, he's smoking it.

38:55.366 --> 38:57.001
Yeah, it's a tuna, man.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.104
It's got to be.
What else could it be?

39:00.204 --> 39:02.373
He took a lot of line.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.475
This is a
big fish, fellas.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.545
Definitely fighting
like a good-sized fish.

39:07.578 --> 39:08.846
Bust his ass, Trey.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.314
Pull on him.
Pull on him. Pull on him.

39:10.381 --> 39:11.916
Pull on him.
Pull on him.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.017
Getting close now.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.852
Yeah.
I see it.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.387
I see, I see,
I see color.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.421
All right.
Let's get him.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.389
Hey, let's, uh.

39:18.422 --> 39:19.423
Yeah, yeah,
let's get him.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.592
Yeah. Oh, Please, baby.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.594
Please, please,
please, please, please.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.563
Please.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.965
Woo!
Yeah, baby!

39:28.032 --> 39:30.134
This is what I
dream about right here.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.502
We got him on.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.137
We're just trying to
close the gap a little bit,

39:33.237 --> 39:35.239
get some of this
string back on the reel.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.975
Try and get back
some mono at least.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.410
He's got a
lot of line stretched out.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.145
It puts more drag on him.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.214
Easy to pull the hook or
something could break.

39:43.247 --> 39:45.082
Oh me!

39:45.149 --> 39:47.218
This is the real
nervous part of it.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.320
Woo!
Yeah, baby!

39:49.353 --> 39:50.721
All right.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.423
Getting a little
something on him now.

39:52.456 --> 39:53.524
You gaining on him?

39:53.624 --> 39:54.959
Yup.
All right.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.961
Haven't
done this in a while.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.629
Oh, boy, I'm stressed out.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.264
Here's your swivel right here.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.999
Come on, baby!

40:02.066 --> 40:03.634
Don't put the cart
before the horse,

40:03.734 --> 40:05.970
just get him up here.

40:06.971 --> 40:07.805
4th quarter now, John.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.974
You got to pay attention.

40:10.007 --> 40:14.111
Man, my chest hurts we
need this one so bad.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.380
Yeah, we spent a lot of
money to get this boat ready

40:16.447 --> 40:18.382
for this season.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.551
Crank it, John.
Crank, crank, crank, crank.

40:20.651 --> 40:23.821
Crank, crank, crank.
He's coming.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.756
Hit him now, Jimmie.

40:25.823 --> 40:28.626
That's too deep, man.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.295
Good shot.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.197
He's running, the
dart could pull out!

40:33.297 --> 40:34.465
You didn't hit him
very good there.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.566
I know,
I know, I know.

40:35.666 --> 40:36.634
I should have waited.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.569
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.772
Just pulled out of him.
Oh,

40:45.576 --> 40:49.947
Hit him now, Jimmie.
He's too deep, man.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.849
Good shot.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.051
He's running,
the dart could pull out.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.052
You didn't hit him
very good there.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.220
I know,
I know, I know.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.221
I should have waited.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.590
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.593
Just pulled out of him.
Oh,

41:02.660 --> 41:04.028
No, it didn't. No, no.

41:04.061 --> 41:05.129
No, no, it
didn't, it didn't.

41:05.162 --> 41:07.231
I still got him on.
Got him?

41:07.331 --> 41:09.300
Not yet.
I'm close.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.434
He's fighting.

41:10.501 --> 41:11.402
All right, Ellis.

41:11.435 --> 41:13.037
Get ready.
Get me that gaff.

41:13.070 --> 41:17.708
Get his tail.
Quick! Quick! Get his tail.

41:17.808 --> 41:22.346
To my left, Trey.
To my left, Trey.
To my left, Trey.

41:22.446 --> 41:23.447
I ain't got
him good in the head.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.348
Get the rope.

41:24.448 --> 41:26.717
I know. I know.

41:26.784 --> 41:28.352
You got him?
I got him.

41:28.452 --> 41:32.890
Hey!
we're going home!

41:32.957 --> 41:34.091
We're going home!

41:34.158 --> 41:34.992
Pretty work!

41:35.092 --> 41:39.263
We did it! Woo!
Pretty work, boys.

41:39.363 --> 41:42.466
Heck yeah.
Put this down on the tail.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.002
95 here.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.570
All right.
Keep going, boys.

41:46.637 --> 41:49.006
We're going home.
Thank God.

41:49.106 --> 41:52.009
I'm a little stressed
about the midnight.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.811
I mean, we're gonna make it.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.480
I just wanna make
sure that we make it.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.550
We'll make it.
We're gonna make it.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.188
ADAM Now
we're getting on him.

42:04.288 --> 42:05.556
4th quarter now, John.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.091
You got to pay attention.

42:07.124 --> 42:09.026
Alright, leader.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.594
Got color! Got color!

42:10.661 --> 42:11.929
Tail wrapped!
He's tail wrapped!

42:11.996 --> 42:12.997
Tail wrapped!

42:13.030 --> 42:15.399
Grab that leader.

42:15.766 --> 42:18.402
Stick him!
Stick him!

42:18.502 --> 42:20.471
Stick him with some power.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.940
Shove it in him, Eric.

42:24.408 --> 42:28.512
Got him? Got him?

42:28.579 --> 42:30.047
He's ours.

42:30.147 --> 42:31.749
Pull it tight.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.050
You got a gaff?
You got a gaff?

42:33.117 --> 42:38.589
He's ours.
We got him, Choppy.

42:38.689 --> 42:39.690
Woo!

42:39.790 --> 42:41.425
Yeah! Yeah!

42:41.492 --> 42:45.696
We got it, baby!
Contact, baby! Contact!

42:45.763 --> 42:47.431
Put a smile on my face.

42:47.498 --> 42:50.167
Damn, man.
9:00. 9, 10, 11.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.635
3 hours.

42:51.702 --> 42:53.537
There ain't no way.
No way, man.

42:53.604 --> 42:54.972
Can we
make it in three hours?

42:55.072 --> 42:56.340
There ain't no way.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.908
Man that's just.

42:57.975 --> 43:00.077
Well that
is one disadvantage of
having a slow boat.

43:00.177 --> 43:02.613
Once it hits
12:00 and one second,

43:02.646 --> 43:05.049
that's your fish
for the next day.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.650
Yeah.
One two three!

43:06.717 --> 43:08.552
Come on! Pull!

43:08.619 --> 43:11.255
Oh, man.

43:11.355 --> 43:13.824
What a fish. What a fish.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.359
Wow.

43:15.459 --> 43:16.727
That's a good one.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.562
And he's a butterball.

43:18.629 --> 43:20.631
There we go, baby.

43:20.664 --> 43:22.733
What is it?

43:22.833 --> 43:24.101
101.

43:24.201 --> 43:27.538
Yeah!
We got a 100 incher, baby!

43:27.571 --> 43:29.940
Told you that fat thing
was gonna take up some room.

43:30.007 --> 43:33.010
Woo!

43:33.944 --> 43:36.480
ADAM That is
the Outlaw's fish.

43:42.486 --> 43:43.687
JIMMIE Oh, boy.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.656
We beat the midnight
a few minutes before,

43:45.689 --> 43:47.391
so we get to go
fishing tomorrow.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.393
We need every day we
can get right now.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.463
First one of the year is gonna
be a big one for us, I hope.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.498
I'm here.

43:54.598 --> 43:55.933
Jimmie, it's
good to see you.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.301
You made it just in
the nick of time.

43:57.334 --> 43:58.202
We did.

43:58.235 --> 44:00.137
We made it before midnight.

44:00.237 --> 44:01.305
Good fish.

44:01.405 --> 44:02.506
I can't wait to see him.

44:02.606 --> 44:05.109
Let's bring up here
and check him out.

44:05.843 --> 44:07.244
I feel really good
about the fact that we got a

44:07.311 --> 44:08.679
bite, period.

44:08.712 --> 44:11.248
So feels good to be back
at the dock with a fish,

44:11.315 --> 44:14.585
and it's the first day and I
hope we have a great season.

44:14.618 --> 44:17.254
We're gonna have a
kick butt season.

44:18.622 --> 44:20.424
What do we got for a weight?

44:20.491 --> 44:22.793
436. All right.
Good deal, guys.

44:22.860 --> 44:24.228
Pretty work.
Pretty work.

44:24.261 --> 44:28.165
Let's check him
out and see what he looks
like on the inside.

44:32.069 --> 44:34.738
So what have we been
looking at for prices lately?

44:34.805 --> 44:37.007
Well, COVID, you know,
has been affecting the market.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.542
A lot of
restaurants are closed.

44:38.609 --> 44:42.346
People aren't going out.
The prices are soft for sure.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.748
However, there's not very many
fish on the market right now

44:44.815 --> 44:48.185
and this got a nice
meat texture and I like
the color there.

44:48.285 --> 44:50.387
You know, unfortunately,
I don't see tons of fat,

44:50.454 --> 44:51.922
like I'm a
little disappointed.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.357
Let's take a look at the core.

44:53.390 --> 44:54.291
I like that.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.459
Oh, it looks nice.

44:55.559 --> 44:56.360
It looks
like raspberry jelly.

44:56.460 --> 44:57.761
That's a really
beautiful core.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.930
Yeah, it's really nice.
It's a nice fish, Jimmie.

44:59.997 --> 45:01.165
Well,
what do you think?

45:01.198 --> 45:02.299
Happy to have him.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.936
I feel like...

45:06.003 --> 45:08.038
I can get y'all $8
a pound for this.

45:08.105 --> 45:09.673
All right, cool.
We'll take $8.

45:09.740 --> 45:10.841
We'll take 8 bucks.

45:10.908 --> 45:11.909
Yeah, I'm
happy to have it.

45:11.942 --> 45:13.844
I'll take another one just like
it tomorrow if you can do it.

45:13.911 --> 45:15.579
I hope we're
right back here tomorrow.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.047
All right.
I hope it's earlier.

45:17.114 --> 45:18.315
I hope I see you
in the morning.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.650
That'd be great.

45:19.683 --> 45:21.385
Really, really
fortunate that we got a bite.

45:21.485 --> 45:24.188
And I feel like my team
kinda came together
for me at the end.

45:24.221 --> 45:27.124
It's a really, really good
feel to have a fish this early

45:27.224 --> 45:29.593
in the season and be ahead
of a bunch of the boats.

45:29.693 --> 45:30.594
We're the Hog Wild.

45:30.694 --> 45:33.664
We're big fast
and first class.

45:53.684 --> 45:56.987
Dear Lord, we got
a drizzly overcast morning,

45:57.054 --> 45:59.790
but it's a great
morning for a bite.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.726
<i>BRITTON Well, we
know we got a special place in
your heart because</i>

46:02.793 --> 46:06.363
<i>so many of your
disciples were fishermen.</i>

46:06.430 --> 46:10.000
<i>So you know us better
than anybody and we
thank you for that.</i>

46:11.101 --> 46:12.970
BRITTON Saying
a prayer over the radio is
something that

46:13.003 --> 46:15.072
was started years ago.

46:15.105 --> 46:17.474
And it started a tradition
and that tradition gradually

46:17.541 --> 46:21.545
expanded to different
people saying the prayer.

46:21.645 --> 46:23.280
It's what we do.

46:23.380 --> 46:24.748
It's a southern thing.

46:24.815 --> 46:26.750
It's the way that we
got to start the day.

46:26.817 --> 46:28.752
<i>BRITTON We ask
that you be with our loved ones.</i>

46:28.819 --> 46:31.121
<i>We ask Lord that you just
watch out and put your hand of</i>

46:31.188 --> 46:33.190
<i>protection around them.</i>

46:33.290 --> 46:36.760
<i>I ask and pray these and
all things in the sweet
precious name of Jesus.</i>

46:36.827 --> 46:37.828
<i>Amen.</i>

46:37.861 --> 46:39.730
<i>GREG Amen, Shack.
Thank you.</i>

46:39.763 --> 46:41.832
<i>ADAM Amen, Shack.
Amen.</i>

46:41.865 --> 46:43.467
<i>GREG Doghouse,
Britton Shackleford.</i>

46:43.500 --> 46:45.569
<i>BRITTON Yes,
Fishin' frenzy.</i>

46:45.669 --> 46:46.770
Where are you?
What are you doing?

46:46.837 --> 46:48.138
How was your evening?

46:48.639 --> 46:50.007
It was a nice evening.

46:50.941 --> 46:53.477
We did not catch a
fish. Need one today.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.479
Okay. I got you.
How about the Rocket?

46:55.579 --> 46:56.780
They didn't spend
the night, did they?

46:56.847 --> 47:00.317
They did, man.
Miserable night for him.

47:00.417 --> 47:02.519
Yeah, I bet they
could use a little shelter.

47:02.586 --> 47:05.122
<i>ZACK You could
say that again.</i>

47:05.155 --> 47:07.691
<i>GREG That's awful.</i>

47:07.791 --> 47:11.228
Yeah, last night
was absolutely miserable.

47:11.295 --> 47:13.864
If we can make this
happen and catch a fish,

47:13.897 --> 47:15.966
it'd be worth it paying off.

47:16.066 --> 47:17.501
That's for sure.

47:17.534 --> 47:19.536
Right now,
we're out here just...

47:19.603 --> 47:21.438
in the general area,
of where the...

47:21.505 --> 47:23.440
Gulf Stream is going
to be each day.

47:23.874 --> 47:25.709
The stream
moves because of...

47:25.776 --> 47:28.312
the winds and
the currents changing...

47:28.812 --> 47:33.417
but it's generally in the same
area throughout the day.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.052
We got any ballyhoos out?

47:35.085 --> 47:36.453
Oh yeah.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.189
About time
to catch us a tuna.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.000
What you got there, Shane?

47:50.067 --> 47:51.468
I don't
know what it is.

47:53.203 --> 47:53.904
It's fightin'.

47:54.905 --> 47:56.907
You want
me to reel him in?

47:56.940 --> 47:58.008
You ready?

47:58.108 --> 47:59.943
Yup.

48:02.279 --> 48:04.848
A few people got
a jump on us yesterday.

48:04.915 --> 48:07.017
We really need
this to be a bluefin.

48:07.117 --> 48:10.754
It'd make the whole
miserable night worthwhile.

48:10.854 --> 48:13.857
If anybody in this
fleet's due one, it's us.

48:13.924 --> 48:15.359
You good, Daniel?

48:15.392 --> 48:17.828
I'd feel
better if we get her.

48:18.595 --> 48:20.130
Fingers crossed.

48:20.230 --> 48:22.833
It'll be our ticket home.

48:26.236 --> 48:29.773
Oh, that was a
tuna, I'm pretty sure.

48:33.510 --> 48:36.313
That's our ticket home.

48:40.150 --> 48:45.255
Be right for us, baby.
I'm pretty tired.

48:46.390 --> 48:50.427
Oh, that was a
tuna, I'm pretty sure.

48:51.862 --> 48:53.430
I know you're out
of it, but dude,

48:53.530 --> 48:55.132
that's our ticket home.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.600
Got to keep
the pressure on him.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.502
Come on,
seventy-four incher.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.605
Bump it. Color.

49:01.638 --> 49:05.609
Big one, ain't he?
Big bite.

49:06.410 --> 49:09.179
There he is.
Put a dart in him.

49:10.647 --> 49:15.285
Tail gaff. Head gaff him.
Whatever.

49:15.719 --> 49:19.022
Here. Over in him.

49:19.089 --> 49:21.358
Tail rope.
Tail rope. Tail rope.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.293
Where's the tail rope?

49:31.034 --> 49:35.839
Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on, man.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.841
Cinched!

49:37.941 --> 49:42.579
Woo! Woo!
That's what it's about!

49:42.646 --> 49:45.382
Yeah!

49:45.449 --> 49:48.585
Stick and stay, make it pay!

49:48.652 --> 49:50.654
Hell yeah, brother.

49:50.687 --> 49:52.189
Good job.

49:52.222 --> 49:53.657
Good job, dude.

49:53.757 --> 49:57.227
Woo! On the board.

49:57.294 --> 49:59.129
Ready?

49:59.229 --> 50:00.931
Yeah.
One two three.

50:00.964 --> 50:02.232
Oh, yeah.

50:02.332 --> 50:04.201
Bigger than
we thought he was.

50:04.234 --> 50:08.839
Oh yeah, he is
now property of the
Rasta Rocket, boys.

50:08.872 --> 50:10.674
Welcome aboard, big fella.

50:10.774 --> 50:15.846
Man, what is that?
92 inches. Yeah, boys.

50:15.879 --> 50:20.250
If there's one thing that dog
loves more than chicken nuggets,

50:20.350 --> 50:22.085
it's a tuna in the boat.

50:22.152 --> 50:23.620
Yeah, baby!

50:23.687 --> 50:26.523
Now there's only one thing to
do but take this behemoth

50:26.590 --> 50:29.092
back to Wanchese.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.367
Back in business, boys.

50:37.434 --> 50:38.802
Outlaw ain't playing around.

50:38.902 --> 50:40.737
Chopper!

50:40.804 --> 50:42.072
How's it going, Scotty?

50:42.172 --> 50:43.173
Long time no see.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.541
Yes, sir.
It's been awhile.

50:44.641 --> 50:46.009
You can't keep the
Outlaws away, huh?

50:46.076 --> 50:47.177
Yup, we're
glad to be back.

50:47.244 --> 50:48.278
We got a nice one.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.813
Looks pretty big, too, man.

50:49.913 --> 50:51.281
Wanna get this thing
up and check it out?

50:51.348 --> 50:53.650
Yeah, let's do it.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.286
Look at that, Scotty.

50:56.386 --> 50:59.022
Chopper,
what do you think, buddy?

50:59.089 --> 51:01.725
Chopper wanted him, too.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.533
That's the
smaller version.

51:09.566 --> 51:11.201
What do we got, Scott?

51:11.268 --> 51:14.404
We're looking
at 469 pounds dressed.

51:14.471 --> 51:15.205
Yeah!

51:15.305 --> 51:16.406
Nice.
There you go.

51:16.473 --> 51:18.742
Yeah!
I told you, yeah!

51:18.842 --> 51:21.745
For the first fish, baby!
Come on! Woo!

51:21.845 --> 51:23.146
Well, how about
we check this thing out?

51:23.213 --> 51:27.317
Yes, sir. Let's do it.
Let's do it.

51:32.122 --> 51:34.591
There's just a
lot of fat in this fish.

51:34.691 --> 51:36.426
So much fat and
it's so greasy.

51:36.493 --> 51:37.494
There you go.

51:37.561 --> 51:39.429
You know, look at
Chopper's eyes and nose.

51:39.496 --> 51:40.597
He's
drooling already.

51:40.697 --> 51:42.032
Yeah, it's a good fish.

51:42.065 --> 51:43.700
Good fat.
Good color.

51:43.767 --> 51:46.703
But this is what
really matters.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.939
You guys might be
all right here.

51:48.972 --> 51:51.174
All right.
Good news.

51:51.241 --> 51:52.342
You guys
did pretty good.

51:52.442 --> 51:54.144
I hope to keep
seeing fish like this.

51:54.177 --> 51:55.679
What are you
thinking, Scotty?

51:55.712 --> 51:57.514
You guys
are looking at.

51:57.581 --> 51:59.883
First fish, Scotty.

52:03.153 --> 52:04.521
11 bucks a pound.

52:04.588 --> 52:07.824
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

52:07.891 --> 52:10.460
Come one! Woo!

52:10.527 --> 52:12.362
We're really
happy we caught this fish.

52:12.462 --> 52:13.597
It's a diamond.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.198
We're excited to get back out
and try and catch another one

52:15.265 --> 52:16.633
just like it.

52:16.733 --> 52:18.168
This is our first
fish of the season.

52:18.268 --> 52:19.469
We're not stopping here.

52:19.536 --> 52:22.005
So these boys
better get ready.

52:22.072 --> 52:24.908
ERIC
Dinner is on me, Choppy.

52:28.545 --> 52:29.446
ZACK Well, boys.

52:29.479 --> 52:32.816
We got it done, it may have
took two days but we did it.

52:32.916 --> 52:36.353
We got a tuna.
We ain't wussies.

52:36.386 --> 52:37.921
There you go.

52:38.021 --> 52:39.823
Bill!
Boys!

52:39.856 --> 52:41.191
What's going on, man?

52:41.224 --> 52:43.226
What's up?
Always love seeing you guys.

52:43.293 --> 52:45.662
Number one is
on the books and boy,

52:45.729 --> 52:46.930
it was a miserable trip.

52:46.997 --> 52:47.864
Cold.

52:47.931 --> 52:48.932
Can you
feel your fingers?

52:48.999 --> 52:50.400
I don't think
she can feel her paws.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.102
I'm trying to warm
them up for her.

52:52.135 --> 52:53.570
Well, let's go ahead and
get this thing up here and get

52:53.637 --> 52:54.938
Minnie warmed up.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.139
Let's do it.

52:56.206 --> 52:58.408
As long as she's fat.
Definitely a round fish.

52:58.508 --> 52:59.843
There you go.

52:59.943 --> 53:03.013
ZACK Conditions
the past two days have been
absolutely brutal.

53:03.046 --> 53:06.249
I'm talking about
miserable of the miserable.

53:06.316 --> 53:10.120
We stuck it out, so
I mean I'm over the
moon right this second.

53:10.153 --> 53:12.789
What we
looking like, Bill?

53:12.856 --> 53:15.325
408 pounds.
Yeah!

53:15.392 --> 53:17.394
Hey, good job, guys.

53:17.427 --> 53:19.963
Well, let's see
how much it's really worth.

53:20.063 --> 53:21.398
Let's do it.

53:25.335 --> 53:29.072
Guys, wow, this is a really
nice looking tail cut.

53:29.139 --> 53:30.974
Look how thick that
wall is right there.

53:31.074 --> 53:32.075
Yes.

53:32.142 --> 53:34.344
And you got a fat all
through the minors coming a

53:34.444 --> 53:36.346
little bit up into the majors.

53:36.446 --> 53:38.081
That's just a
really oily fish.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.984
Let's see what
the old core looks like.

53:41.084 --> 53:42.352
Ooh, Man.

53:42.452 --> 53:44.054
Oh, moi-gosh.

53:44.087 --> 53:45.522
Look how
translucent it is.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.824
Yeah, this is
just a killer fish.

53:47.891 --> 53:52.462
The markets, they haven't
seen a whole lot yet,
all that said...

54:01.204 --> 54:02.839
ZACK Come on, now.
You're killing me.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.641
What's the price?

54:08.545 --> 54:10.647
BILL Yeah, this
is just a killer fish.

54:10.747 --> 54:13.483
The markets, they haven't seen
a whole lot yet, all that said.

54:19.322 --> 54:22.225
Come on now.
You're killing me.

54:22.292 --> 54:23.727
What's the price?

54:23.760 --> 54:24.828
$14 a pound.

54:24.861 --> 54:27.197
Yeah, dude.
Definitely.

54:27.230 --> 54:28.832
To start it out, I mean.

54:28.865 --> 54:30.033
Yeah. Good job, guys.
Good job.

54:30.133 --> 54:31.301
Good job, dude.
See you tomorrow.

54:31.334 --> 54:32.669
Hey, y'all
be safe out there.

54:32.769 --> 54:33.737
Pleasure, dude.

54:33.770 --> 54:35.772
Congratulations, guys.
First fish.

54:35.839 --> 54:37.607
Way to start it off strong.

54:37.674 --> 54:39.142
ZACK We're the
underdog and we know it,

54:39.242 --> 54:44.247
but $14 at 400 pounds
that could be enough
to set us on top.

54:44.314 --> 54:45.982
And that's a big statement.

54:46.049 --> 54:48.418
We're here to prove that we're
just as good as all of these

54:48.485 --> 54:51.488
bigger boats and keep rocking
it because that's how the

54:51.521 --> 54:53.523
Rasta Rocket does.

54:55.325 --> 54:57.961
There's only one thing
left do, ice up, gas up,

54:58.061 --> 55:00.130
and get back out there
and get you another one.

55:00.163 --> 55:02.232
That's right.

55:10.507 --> 55:11.641
Someone needs to let
the tunas know that they're

55:11.708 --> 55:13.276
supposed to give us a bite.

55:13.343 --> 55:15.345
Someone needs
to send them a memo.

55:15.378 --> 55:16.880
They ain't got it yet.

55:16.913 --> 55:19.182
No.

55:19.249 --> 55:23.086
This is right here,
our plot line where
we stayed all morning

55:23.186 --> 55:26.256
around these bites, so hopefully
we'll get us a bite here.

55:26.289 --> 55:28.558
Get that stick out.

55:28.658 --> 55:31.094
Aye, aye, Cap.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.163
I'm in
the mark right now.

55:33.930 --> 55:36.099
BO Being the first
mate on the Doghouse means I do

55:36.199 --> 55:38.535
whatever the Captain says.

55:38.568 --> 55:41.805
The Doghouse is a
very tight ship.

55:41.838 --> 55:44.107
Britton is very easy
to get along with.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.910
I have enjoyed working
with him for the last year.

55:46.943 --> 55:48.745
One, two.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.114
BRITTON Definitely
want to catch a fish.

55:51.214 --> 55:54.317
We need to catch a fish,
just get back in the pack.

55:54.384 --> 55:59.489
Just a tremendous amount of
expense getting ready to go

55:59.556 --> 56:01.324
for the season.

56:01.391 --> 56:02.926
Need a fish for my boys.

56:02.959 --> 56:06.396
Need a fish to get
rid of some bills.

56:08.131 --> 56:09.699
I got some
porpoise over here.

56:09.766 --> 56:11.501
Mammals are a
really good sign.

56:11.568 --> 56:13.403
You catch tunas
around mammals a lot.

56:13.503 --> 56:15.405
They feed on the same food.

56:15.505 --> 56:18.708
But mammals are too
smart to eat our baits,

56:18.775 --> 56:21.344
but the tunas, the tunas will.

56:21.411 --> 56:23.880
You catch tunas around
dolphin and whales a lot.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.082
CATLIN The
conditions are never the same,

56:26.149 --> 56:29.419
so being able to
adjust to what the
conditions are each day.

56:29.452 --> 56:31.955
It's not something you
can just guess about.

56:31.988 --> 56:33.356
You have to know
exactly what you're doing.

56:33.423 --> 56:34.991
You have to have a
certain instinct.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.326
Without Britton doing his job,

56:36.359 --> 56:38.728
Bo and I don't even get
a chance to perform.

56:39.896 --> 56:42.599
Mark right there.
Single fish mark right there.

56:42.632 --> 56:43.900
Come on, land hit it!

56:44.000 --> 56:45.635
Here comes another mark.

56:45.702 --> 56:48.004
BRITTON
Being a captain is a
lot of responsibility.

56:48.071 --> 56:53.877
It's making sure that my boat
is in good working condition.

56:53.910 --> 56:56.913
It's making sure
that my crew are happy,

56:57.013 --> 57:00.283
that they're safe, that
they're fishing hard.

57:00.350 --> 57:03.386
But there is a question in
your mind when you start with

57:03.453 --> 57:06.623
a new crew about whether
that crew is gonna mesh.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.926
Here you go.
Follow this thing.

57:09.993 --> 57:12.495
So far I'm super
impressed with both of them.

57:12.562 --> 57:15.031
There might be three or four
different packs of them,

57:15.098 --> 57:17.033
I don't know.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.768
Hey, those are
bluefins right there, dude.

57:18.835 --> 57:21.104
Look, bluefins
right here, dude.

57:21.137 --> 57:23.773
Those are tunas right there.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.575
I'm getting.
I'm putting you on 'em.

57:25.642 --> 57:28.311
A ton of bluefins
on the surface right
here beside us.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.480
About to drag our
squids right over top of it.

57:30.513 --> 57:31.948
BRITTON So you
want to jig the stick,

57:32.015 --> 57:34.217
pulling up and down on the
line to make the plastic

57:34.284 --> 57:36.853
squids look alive
to the bluefin.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.056
Come on, Lord.
Give me something here.

57:40.924 --> 57:42.859
There he is!

57:42.959 --> 57:45.962
Oh (bleep)!
Get away from that thing.

57:46.029 --> 57:49.232
(bleep)!

57:49.966 --> 57:51.601
Stop the boat.
Stop the boat!

57:51.668 --> 57:53.670
What was that?

57:53.703 --> 57:56.773
Oh (bleep)!
What happened there?

57:56.806 --> 57:58.541
The main line snapped.

57:58.608 --> 58:01.411
I don't like that.
I don't like that at all.

58:01.444 --> 58:03.680
That line is
just floating out there.

58:03.713 --> 58:04.814
All right.

58:04.881 --> 58:05.949
We got to get
around and get the ball.

58:05.982 --> 58:07.517
Yeah, get
around get the ball.

58:07.617 --> 58:10.887
This is not good.

58:13.690 --> 58:15.625
BRITTON The
main line is attached to the
bandit reel on one end,

58:15.692 --> 58:18.361
and the bird and
poly-ball on the other,

58:18.428 --> 58:21.731
but with it broken, the fish
still has the hook in his mouth,

58:21.798 --> 58:24.367
but the only thing attached
is that bird and poly-ball.

58:24.467 --> 58:26.469
We got to get out there,
grab it with a gaff,

58:26.536 --> 58:29.005
and reconnect it to the bandit
reel before that fish takes

58:29.072 --> 58:31.741
off and takes the bird
and poly-ball with it.

58:32.909 --> 58:34.477
What are
we gonna do here, Bo?

58:34.544 --> 58:36.079
Crank everything on backwards.

58:36.112 --> 58:37.280
Okay.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.282
Gaff that ball.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.184
What part did it break?

58:41.217 --> 58:42.485
Halfway down the spool.

58:42.552 --> 58:47.290
It just decided it didn't want
to be with us no more, so.

58:47.657 --> 58:50.927
Cap, slow down.
We're coming up to the ball.

58:52.595 --> 58:58.134
Getting close.
Getting close now.

58:59.836 --> 59:02.038
Careful guys.
We don't wanna lose it.

59:03.673 --> 59:06.476
We need this one, man.

59:12.015 --> 59:13.783
BO Gaff that ball.

59:13.850 --> 59:16.686
Getting close.
Getting close now.

59:16.753 --> 59:20.890
Careful guys.
We don't want to lose it.

59:22.625 --> 59:24.527
I don't like that mess.

59:24.594 --> 59:26.963
We need
this one, man.

59:28.031 --> 59:30.700
Yeah,
we're getting there.

59:30.767 --> 59:31.868
All right. Hold that.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.236
We circled back
around and got the ball.

59:33.269 --> 59:35.805
We're going backwards on
him, but this is very,

59:35.872 --> 59:38.541
very peculiar to do.

59:38.608 --> 59:40.076
Get it straight!

59:40.176 --> 59:42.045
Oh, I got him hooked up.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.247
That fish doesn't
have that weight or that

59:44.280 --> 59:46.916
poly-ball floating him,
so we're just floating it

59:46.983 --> 59:50.253
straight on the line here now.

59:50.286 --> 59:52.555
We're good right here.
Everything is good, okay.

59:52.622 --> 59:54.624
About 50 feet away.

59:54.724 --> 59:56.092
We got color.

59:58.995 --> 1:00:01.364
Forward.
Yeah, stick his ass.

1:00:01.464 --> 1:00:04.167
Throw it!
Throw it!

1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:05.735
It's in there.

1:00:05.802 --> 1:00:09.005
Good job, Cap.

1:00:09.072 --> 1:00:10.840
Gaff that one.
Okay.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.576
Oh, that
looks like a good one.

1:00:13.643 --> 1:00:16.012
Got him?
Got him.

1:00:16.112 --> 1:00:18.114
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on now.

1:00:18.181 --> 1:00:20.316
Hurry up.

1:00:20.383 --> 1:00:22.318
Get me another
gaff in his head.

1:00:22.385 --> 1:00:25.388
Come put the
live line on him.

1:00:35.398 --> 1:00:36.766
Got him, Cap?

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:39.202
Let him go.
I got him.

1:00:39.235 --> 1:00:41.604
I got to get
up on this cleat here.

1:00:43.406 --> 1:00:44.307
Awesome job.

1:00:44.407 --> 1:00:45.875
Good job.

1:00:45.942 --> 1:00:48.578
For the catastrophe
we were dealt, that
went pretty good.

1:00:48.611 --> 1:00:50.313
Welcome to bluefining, Catlin.

1:00:50.346 --> 1:00:51.714
I wouldn't
have it any other way.

1:00:51.781 --> 1:00:53.516
I'm excited. Happy.

1:00:53.616 --> 1:00:55.885
Glad to be
playing the game now.

1:00:55.952 --> 1:00:57.887
First fish of the season.

1:00:57.987 --> 1:01:00.990
We've got to really concentrate
on catching a quality fish now

1:01:01.057 --> 1:01:03.526
because we don't know
how the market's gonna be.

1:01:03.626 --> 1:01:06.129
And that's why we got him on
this swim hook right here.

1:01:06.162 --> 1:01:11.000
A swim hook that fish
will gradually calm down.

1:01:11.067 --> 1:01:13.603
That amino acid
will leave their meat.

1:01:13.636 --> 1:01:17.607
And the quality of the
meat's gonna be much better.

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:21.377
Ready?
Oh, butterball.

1:01:21.444 --> 1:01:24.714
Butterball, boy!
Woo, welcome to it.

1:01:24.747 --> 1:01:26.282
Yes sir.
Huh.

1:01:26.349 --> 1:01:28.284
50 different things that
could have gone wrong.

1:01:28.351 --> 1:01:30.186
My guys handled it.

1:01:30.253 --> 1:01:35.658
No hoot and hollering,
oh my gosh, whatever,
just go to work.

1:01:35.725 --> 1:01:38.895
Let's measure this thing.

1:01:39.195 --> 1:01:42.465
94, buddy. 94.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:46.569
That's a nice.
Nice first.

1:01:46.636 --> 1:01:47.770
Nice first one, buddy.

1:01:47.837 --> 1:01:49.205
Good job.
Great job.

1:01:49.272 --> 1:01:50.673
We're
playing the game now.

1:01:50.740 --> 1:01:52.575
Thank you, Jesus.
We're in the game.

1:01:52.642 --> 1:01:55.311
I'm happy.

1:02:07.323 --> 1:02:10.059
BRITTON
Show me the money.

1:02:10.793 --> 1:02:12.762
Micah, Eric, what's happening?

1:02:12.795 --> 1:02:14.330
Hey, Doghouse.
How's it going, fellas?

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:15.331
So good to see y'all.

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:17.333
Yeah, welcome back.

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.501
First fish of the season.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:19.502
We earned it.

1:02:19.569 --> 1:02:20.703
Check it out.
Check it out.

1:02:20.770 --> 1:02:22.772
Get it off the boat.

1:02:22.805 --> 1:02:25.041
I got a new crew.
Cat and Bo.

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:28.211
They did exceptionally well.

1:02:36.519 --> 1:02:38.154
What do you got, Micah?

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:41.257
368.
368. Yeah.

1:02:41.357 --> 1:02:44.727
Awesome, guys.
See what you got.

1:02:45.528 --> 1:02:49.165
Beautiful fish, fellas.
Beautiful fish.

1:02:53.102 --> 1:02:54.804
Not bad.

1:02:54.837 --> 1:02:56.339
Let's take a
closer look at this.

1:02:56.372 --> 1:02:58.975
It's got a deep red color,
which is beautiful.

1:02:59.008 --> 1:03:00.376
We love that cherry color.

1:03:00.443 --> 1:03:02.011
We love that dark, dark red.

1:03:02.078 --> 1:03:04.280
There is a lot of fat.

1:03:04.347 --> 1:03:06.115
So like when you're in the
grocery store and see you the

1:03:06.182 --> 1:03:08.751
fat in a rib eye, that's
exactly what we see here.

1:03:08.818 --> 1:03:10.453
This is a premium fish.

1:03:10.553 --> 1:03:11.821
Thank you.
Bottom line.

1:03:11.921 --> 1:03:14.290
Bottom line...

1:03:14.390 --> 1:03:16.025
I'm gonna pay you
$15 on this fish.

1:03:16.092 --> 1:03:17.827
15 bucks.
Awesome.

1:03:17.860 --> 1:03:19.295
Better than five grand.

1:03:19.395 --> 1:03:22.765
Yeah.
Really appreciate it.

1:03:22.832 --> 1:03:24.467
Thank you so much.
Good job, guys.

1:03:24.567 --> 1:03:25.401
Thank you.

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:27.036
Hopefully we'll
see y'all tomorrow.

1:03:27.136 --> 1:03:28.404
All right, we'll
see you guys. Thanks.

1:03:28.471 --> 1:03:29.572
Y'all
have a good night.

1:03:29.672 --> 1:03:32.141
BRITTON It's our
first fish, 15 bucks a pound.

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:33.676
Better than five grand.

1:03:33.743 --> 1:03:36.846
You know, we spent a lot
of money trying to get the
boat ready to go.

1:03:36.879 --> 1:03:39.949
This is gonna pay that and
both of my crew are gonna

1:03:40.049 --> 1:03:41.784
have a nice check.

1:03:41.851 --> 1:03:42.885
It's huge.

1:03:42.952 --> 1:03:44.854
It's a wonderful,
wonderful way to start.

1:03:44.954 --> 1:03:50.226
You cook, he'll drive, and
I'll just sit inside and look

1:03:50.293 --> 1:03:53.029
out the windows.

1:03:55.798 --> 1:03:58.901
<i>As the season opens,
the smallest boat in the fleet,</i>

1:03:58.968 --> 1:04:01.671
<i>Rasta Rocket
gets the largest payday.</i>

1:04:01.704 --> 1:04:05.675
<i>But less than $200 behind is
the Doghouse followed by</i>

1:04:05.708 --> 1:04:08.978
<i>the helping hands of
Offshore Outlaw.</i>

1:04:09.045 --> 1:04:12.915

Hog Wild have a respectable
first showing,</i>

1:04:12.982 --> 1:04:15.885

Reel E' Bugging,</i>

1:04:15.985 --> 1:04:18.888

1:04:25.061 --> 1:04:27.697
BRITTON
I'm competing for the guys
in the cockpit and the

1:04:27.730 --> 1:04:29.532
bills on the table.

1:04:29.565 --> 1:04:32.201
So fishing hard, being
blessed with a catch,

1:04:32.268 --> 1:04:34.437
all of that is vital.

1:04:34.470 --> 1:04:37.373
When I'm catching, I
wanna keep on catching.

1:04:37.473 --> 1:04:39.175
I wanna keep on producing.

1:04:39.208 --> 1:04:41.210
I wanna be a gracious winner.

1:04:41.277 --> 1:04:43.112
GREG I've got
a reputation to uphold.

1:04:43.212 --> 1:04:44.647
I've always
caught a lot of fish,

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:47.216
I always push hard,
and this year,

1:04:47.283 --> 1:04:49.585
I got some boats that are
definitely gonna be pushing,

1:04:49.652 --> 1:04:51.721
but I've won four season here.

1:04:51.754 --> 1:04:55.224
It's no secret that I'm
one of the top boats.

1:04:56.359 --> 1:04:58.828
NICK My slow start
sucked, but I've been low,

1:04:58.861 --> 1:05:00.496
I've been last,
and I've come back.

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:03.499
Here we go, it's
just getting started.

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:08.104
Yeah, we'll have to go
out there in rough weather.

1:05:08.137 --> 1:05:09.772
Stay out in the ocean,
live out in the ocean.

1:05:09.872 --> 1:05:14.777
Some kind of crazy
and that's bluefining.

1:05:16.779 --> 1:05:18.948
BOBBY
There's a lot on the
line personally for me.

1:05:18.981 --> 1:05:21.250
We showed up here and we
competed two years ago and

1:05:21.317 --> 1:05:22.585
we won this thing.

1:05:22.618 --> 1:05:25.855
And then we come out
the following year
and we came in last.

1:05:25.888 --> 1:05:29.759
If we can come back this year
and spank all the competition.

1:05:29.792 --> 1:05:33.262
I know I can catch as
many fish as anybody
in the fleet, period.

1:05:34.864 --> 1:05:36.065
JIMMIE Being the
young guns, we're gonna be the

1:05:36.132 --> 1:05:37.867
future to this industry.

1:05:37.900 --> 1:05:39.268
These guys aren't
gonna be around forever.

1:05:39.335 --> 1:05:40.903
Somebody's got
to take it over.

1:05:40.970 --> 1:05:44.340
We just want to prove to them
that we have what it takes.

1:05:44.807 --> 1:05:47.610
ADAM Everybody
fishing in this competition
wants to win

1:05:47.710 --> 1:05:50.179
like there's not a
doubt in my mind.

1:05:50.246 --> 1:05:52.815
So, if we can pull this off
and take the number one spot,

1:05:52.915 --> 1:05:54.650
it would be quite
an accomplishment.

1:05:54.717 --> 1:05:55.918
Woo!

1:05:55.985 --> 1:05:57.920
ZACK We look to
beat all of them this year.

1:05:57.987 --> 1:06:00.289
We don't have a
target on anybody's back.

1:06:00.356 --> 1:06:04.994
We're running our own race and
we want to win just as bad as

1:06:05.094 --> 1:06:08.197
any of these other guys, but
you got to be a little crazy

1:06:08.297 --> 1:06:10.666
to get the job done.
