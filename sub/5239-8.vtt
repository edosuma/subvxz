12:26.588 --> 12:29.839
[sighs] I emailed him a long
apology and he hasn't written back.

12:29.841 --> 12:31.875
I can't bear to have him angry with me.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.210
It'll pass. I promise.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.712
He's very forgiving.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.714
I almost gave him an overdose

12:37.716 --> 12:39.432
and now he calls me his son.

12:39.434 --> 12:41.718
You know, I met Walter
when I was 12 years old.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.553
What? How is that possible?

12:44.940 --> 12:47.557
He came to my school to
judge an essay contest

12:47.559 --> 12:50.860
and he chose mine as the prizewinner.

12:50.862 --> 12:54.280
- Hmm.
- It was about apartheid.

12:54.282 --> 12:56.449
- You were against it?
- Of course.

12:56.451 --> 12:58.701
Yeah.

12:58.703 --> 13:00.737
Well, does Walter know about this?

13:00.739 --> 13:02.405
No, I never told him.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.958
My dad died about a
month before I met Walter,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.911
and it was like everything was black

13:07.913 --> 13:10.213
and my eyes were closed all the time.

13:10.215 --> 13:13.716
And this famous man, this war hero,

13:13.718 --> 13:16.252
comes and chooses my essay

13:16.254 --> 13:17.921
and puts his hand on my
shoulder for a picture

13:17.923 --> 13:20.974
and the world wasn't black anymore.

13:20.976 --> 13:22.642
You really should tell Walter.

13:22.644 --> 13:25.728
No, I'll seem like a stalker.

13:25.730 --> 13:28.982
I've been sort of
following him for 25 years.

13:28.984 --> 13:30.600
That is a long time.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.652
You can't tell anyone what a freak I am.

13:32.654 --> 13:35.772
- Do you promise?
- I promise. I'll never tell anyone.

13:35.774 --> 13:39.993
Also, you should know,
I don't judge freaks.

13:39.995 --> 13:43.496
I mean, I judge me,

13:43.498 --> 13:46.366
but I don't judge you.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.280
Bronson is upset.

13:54.282 --> 13:56.166
They had a meeting in New York.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.753
It was just a talk at a college, Bob.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.373
And the Internet has
turned me into a plagiarist

14:03.375 --> 14:06.176
through innuendo and misinformation.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.345
- God.
- It's just like the Dreyfus affair.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.046
Richard Dreyfuss is having an affair?

14:10.048 --> 14:13.600
No, the Dreyfus affair.
Paris, 19th century.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.352
Whatever. Bronson read
<i>The Huffington Post</i>

14:15.354 --> 14:16.720
and he wants you to release a statement.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.389
What is ironic is that the
speech I eventually gave

14:19.391 --> 14:23.360
was about how the Internet is
destroying verifiable journalism.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.562
Newspapers are dead and we're next.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.697
- Don't say that.
- <i>Well, you know it's true.</i>

14:27.699 --> 14:31.401
And I am running out of
time to get my message across

14:31.403 --> 14:34.120
instead of having to
deal with this bullshit!

14:34.122 --> 14:37.791
Everything will be okay. This
will blow over, I know it.

14:37.793 --> 14:41.244
But he's being ridiculed
and it's all my fault.

14:41.246 --> 14:44.414
Yeah, it is. But it's... it's okay.

14:44.416 --> 14:47.167
We all support you, Celia. I support you.

14:47.169 --> 14:49.586
[sighs] Thanks, Shelly.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.087
It's just a little bit to the right.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.756
Oh, sure.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.507
Mmm.

14:54.509 --> 14:58.561
Oh, that feels so chocolaty.

14:58.563 --> 15:00.480
Mmm.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.266
You know, I had a dream
about you last night.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.403
We were wearing the same top again

15:06.405 --> 15:09.105
and I was unlocking my bike

15:09.107 --> 15:12.325
and suddenly we were kissing.

15:12.327 --> 15:15.111
- Oh, that's funny.
- Yeah.

15:15.113 --> 15:17.697
I guess because of your
problems with Walter,

15:17.699 --> 15:20.533
I was trying in my dream to comfort you.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.286
- Mmm.
- Also I used to be bisexual.

15:23.288 --> 15:26.623
- Oh.
- Yeah, in college.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.625
And I think I miss it.

15:30.178 --> 15:33.513
'Cause I can't cum with men.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.265
Oh, dear.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.935
Yeah, but with girls, it was always easy.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.805
I was less self-conscious, you know?

15:41.807 --> 15:44.691
Or, you know, orgasms can be elusive.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.777
Sometimes just a hot bath can be nice.

15:47.779 --> 15:50.730
When I woke up this morning,

15:50.732 --> 15:53.650
I was sad that it was just a dream.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.201
Mmm.

15:55.203 --> 15:58.705
So, yoo-hoo.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.623
Should we kiss right now?

16:00.625 --> 16:02.826
Shelly, you're making
me very uncomfortable.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.994
You know that I have porous boundaries.

16:04.996 --> 16:09.382
Just a little kiss before we start working.

16:09.384 --> 16:11.417
Like a cup of coffee.

16:11.419 --> 16:14.304
Teddy was lucid on Saturday

16:14.306 --> 16:15.638
when we were at the doctor,

16:15.640 --> 16:20.260
but then on Sunday he was confused again.

16:20.262 --> 16:22.679
I've had to take away his car keys.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.265
Oh, that sounds really hard, Rosalie.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.433
I wish I could help you somehow.

16:27.435 --> 16:31.488
You do by listening to me.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.023
I really value our friendship.

16:34.025 --> 16:35.909
Me, too.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.529
But sometimes I just... I feel so confused.

16:39.531 --> 16:43.449
You know, not... not about
us, but about everything.

16:43.451 --> 16:47.203
My life. I'm going to be 28 soon.

16:47.205 --> 16:49.672
28.

16:49.674 --> 16:52.292
Martin, I want you to know
that I don't want to put

16:52.294 --> 16:54.294
any restrictions on you.

16:54.296 --> 16:56.462
You're young and need to feel free.

16:56.464 --> 16:58.882
I know. I mean, I don't have a Teddy,

16:58.884 --> 17:01.601
but I have other special friends.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.887
You do?

17:06.858 --> 17:08.808
Jim, I just came from Gardner's office.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.362
We have to release a statement
about this Foster Wallace debacle.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.513
- Ah, shit.
- Yes.

17:13.634 --> 17:17.400
I'm an innocent man who has
to declare his innocence.

17:17.402 --> 17:20.904
So let's get Celia and craft
something really strong.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.539
I'll get you your coffee, sir.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.906
Uh, Walter?

17:23.909 --> 17:26.576
Celia feels really terrible
about what happened.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.411
Well, she should.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.917
Celia! Shelly!

17:33.919 --> 17:35.501
What the hell are you two doing?

17:35.503 --> 17:37.554
It's only 9:30 in the morning.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.055
No, it's not what it looks like.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.424
Shelly had a dream and
I can't say no. [scoffs]

17:41.426 --> 17:44.010
Celia, you have turned
your office into a boudoir.

17:44.012 --> 17:46.429
I have not turned my office into a boudoir.

17:54.689 --> 17:56.940
Who kisses so early in the morning?

17:56.942 --> 18:00.777
Major, Vivian and Bertie are down
in the lobby and on their way up.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.946
What? Why?

18:02.948 --> 18:05.531
There's been some kind
of trouble at the school.

18:05.533 --> 18:07.951
A boy told Bertie you
copied someone's homework

18:07.953 --> 18:09.452
and Bertie struck the lad.

18:09.454 --> 18:12.088
Oh, my God.

18:12.090 --> 18:16.009
This plagiarism fiasco has
even reached a preschool.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.044
He's only been suspended for today,

18:18.046 --> 18:20.930
but if he misbehaves like this
again, Walter, it won't be good.

18:20.932 --> 18:22.548
He can even be kicked out.

18:22.550 --> 18:24.968
- Kicked out of preschool?
- BERTIE: No, no!

18:24.970 --> 18:27.520
Children roughhouse. It's part of life.

18:27.522 --> 18:30.807
Not at Westlake. It's
postracial and gender-neutral.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.643
You know that. Bertie
shouldn't have hit that boy.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.561
He's never been violent before.

18:35.563 --> 18:37.780
I fault the parents of the child he hit.

18:37.782 --> 18:39.532
They should not have been talking about me.

18:39.534 --> 18:42.035
I am proud of Bertie. He defended my honor.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.987
No, you cannot encourage
that sort of thing.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.155
He told that boy he hit
that he was a samurai.

18:46.157 --> 18:47.991
He said that?

18:47.993 --> 18:49.659
Did you show him a
violent movie or something?

18:49.661 --> 18:51.494
- Of course not.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

18:51.496 --> 18:53.579
Listen, Vivian, um...

18:53.581 --> 18:54.998
I have a lot of work.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.966
Can I come around this evening

18:56.968 --> 18:59.752
and then I can talk to Bertie
properly about all of this?

18:59.754 --> 19:02.005
- BERTIE: Faster!
- Oh, I win!

19:02.007 --> 19:03.890
Banzai!

19:05.394 --> 19:09.178
Okay, we need to draft a statement.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.180
First of all, I'm so sorry.

19:11.182 --> 19:13.733
I don't need apologies,
Celia, I need ideas.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.569
Well, I was thinking that in
addition to your statement,

19:16.571 --> 19:17.904
you should tackle this head-on.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.189
You gave a great speech,
but the blogosphere

19:20.191 --> 19:22.692
hijacked your message
with this phony accusation.

19:22.694 --> 19:23.450
What are you suggesting?

19:23.570 --> 19:26.029
Well, I've contacted the chief media writer

19:26.031 --> 19:28.197
at the <i> LA Times</i> and put
him on hold for this evening.

19:28.199 --> 19:31.501
And you can discuss with him
how your stoning on the Internet

19:31.503 --> 19:33.586
is an example of what you
warned about in your speech.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.621
Rosalie, Jim, what do you two think?

19:35.623 --> 19:37.674
- I think it's strong.
- Me, too.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.759
- Excellent approach, Celia.
- Thank you, Walter.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.011
But I have something else on my mind.

19:42.013 --> 19:44.180
I am not a prude, as you all know,

19:44.182 --> 19:48.267
but I think people should stop using
their offices for sexual encounters.

19:48.269 --> 19:50.887
<i>I mean, you all</i>
<i>work very hard,</i>

19:50.889 --> 19:53.856
but there are other ways to relieve stress.

19:53.858 --> 19:56.976
- Masturbation.
- Not during business hours.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.646
What about affection and spooning?

20:00.648 --> 20:03.232
That can still go on within reason.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.201
What about towel whipping, Major?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.953
That's not sexual, Harry.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.072
It's not?

20:10.542 --> 20:14.577
So are you and Shelly a couple now?

20:14.579 --> 20:16.746
No, I was trying to help her.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.632
- She missed being bisexual.
- <i>WALTER: Welcome back.</i>

20:19.634 --> 20:22.752
We are here with media writer David Frisch

20:22.754 --> 20:27.673
of the <i> Los Angeles Times</i> to
discuss the events surrounding me

20:27.675 --> 20:29.258
in the last 48 hours,

20:29.260 --> 20:32.979
which is a perfect example
of the kind of lynchings

20:32.981 --> 20:37.016
the Internet favors over
real, fact-based journalism.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.601
Welcome to <i> Blunt Talk,</i> David.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.153
Thank you, I'm very happy to be here.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.605
- Last weekend I gave a speech...
- Yeah.

20:42.607 --> 20:45.274
At the Annenberg School of Journalism

20:45.276 --> 20:49.996
and by mistake one of my assistants
gave me her research notes

20:49.998 --> 20:53.616
instead of the lecture we
had been working on together.

20:53.618 --> 20:56.285
Yes, I read your statement
on the matter, and...

20:56.287 --> 20:59.622
you may or may not be aware of it,
but there were two grammatical errors.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.258
Well, so much for the
British educational system.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.093
[both laugh]

21:04.095 --> 21:06.796
Anyway, included in her notes

21:06.798 --> 21:09.849
was David Foster Wallace's wonderful speech

21:09.851 --> 21:14.353
given at Kenyon College, and
by mistake I began to read it.

21:14.355 --> 21:17.723
Now, clearly, I would never plagiarize

21:17.725 --> 21:20.860
a well-known speech given
by such an eminent writer.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.362
But the Internet decided...

21:23.364 --> 21:26.232
So you're... you're saying
that you would never plagiarize

21:26.234 --> 21:29.152
- because you yourself are a published author?
- Exactly.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.070
And, you know, to prepare
for this interview,

21:31.072 --> 21:33.873
I read your book <i>A Soldier's Lament</i>

21:33.875 --> 21:36.876
and, uh, I found a passage in
it that I think is very relevant

21:36.878 --> 21:39.295
to this discussion. Do you mind?

21:39.297 --> 21:42.915
Well, I can't imagine I touched
much on the Internet 30 years ago,

21:42.917 --> 21:44.300
but, no, please, go ahead.

21:44.302 --> 21:48.254
"In war our elders may give the orders,

21:48.256 --> 21:50.173
but it is the young who have to fight.

21:50.175 --> 21:54.177
<i>It is the young soldier who</i>
<i>must bear the deepest wounds</i>

21:54.179 --> 21:56.846
and scars of war."

21:56.848 --> 21:58.815
Do you remember writing this?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.817
Actually, no, I don't.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.436
Though these are sentiments
that I stand by today.

22:03.438 --> 22:05.988
You don't remember writing this

22:05.990 --> 22:09.158
- because you didn't write this.
- I'm sorry?

22:09.160 --> 22:12.829
These words were lifted and combined
from General Douglas MacArthur

22:12.831 --> 22:15.781
and T.H. White, the author of <i>
The Once and Future King.</i>

22:15.783 --> 22:19.418
Well, I have never read
anything of General MacArthur,

22:19.420 --> 22:21.838
though T.H. White is one
of my favorite authors.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.873
Oh, is that why you
chose to steal from him?

22:23.875 --> 22:26.175
<i>WALTER: What are you doing?</i>

22:26.177 --> 22:28.044
Are you another one of those

22:28.046 --> 22:30.847
jumping on the social
media merry-go-round

22:30.849 --> 22:32.765
hoping to make a name for
yourself at my expense?

22:32.767 --> 22:35.268
[laughs] No, I am merely practicing

22:35.270 --> 22:37.220
the thing that you just said was dying...

22:37.222 --> 22:39.388
fact-based journalism.

22:39.390 --> 22:42.058
And you can read all about
it later on my Tumblr.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.060
Well, of course that explains everything.

22:44.062 --> 22:47.196
Look, if I combined the
words of General MacArthur

22:47.198 --> 22:49.815
and T.H. White over 30 years ago,

22:49.817 --> 22:52.034
- I did so unwittingly.
- So you're saying you did it.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.870
- Thank you, Mr. Frisch.
- That's news.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.821
You can return to your pleasant pastime

22:55.823 --> 22:58.541
of castrating writers who
have more to say than you do.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.326
We'll be right back after this.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.831
You, sir, can go fuck yourself!

23:05.833 --> 23:08.885
It was your idea, Celia,
having him on the show.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.554
He sandbagged me. You
didn't vet him properly.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.474
Walter, it's not a fuck-up.
You handled him beautifully.

23:15.476 --> 23:17.426
I loved the castration line.

23:17.428 --> 23:18.928
- Really?
- Yeah, me, too. It was great.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.479
Yeah, you really nailed that jerk.

23:20.481 --> 23:22.765
- Really?
- Walter, I'm so sorry we brought him on.

23:22.767 --> 23:23.767
I can't believe this happened.

23:23.887 --> 23:25.637
Well, I can believe it, Celia.

23:25.639 --> 23:28.423
You have been unfocused and
out of control for weeks.

23:28.425 --> 23:30.141
Weeks? It's just a couple of days.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.010
Dr. Weiss hasn't helped at all.

23:32.012 --> 23:34.062
I am very disappointed in you.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.999
- Disappointed?
- Yes.

23:36.119 --> 23:38.762
I mean I... I never know
what's going on with you.

23:38.882 --> 23:40.053
Sir, don't say that.

23:40.344 --> 23:42.344
She hates to disappoint you.

23:42.641 --> 23:44.872
She's loved since she was twelve.

23:44.992 --> 23:48.076
Jim! I can't believe...

23:48.078 --> 23:50.745
and if you are disappointed
and you want to fire me,

23:50.747 --> 23:52.581
then don't worry because I quit.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.249
I quit <i> Blunt Talk.</i>

23:54.251 --> 23:57.002
- Celia!
- Celia!

23:57.004 --> 23:59.588
Both of you just leave me alone.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.625
<i>♪</i>

24:09.933 --> 24:12.133
That boy was mean about you.

24:12.135 --> 24:14.135
I know, Bertie. I know.

24:14.137 --> 24:18.690
But the thing in life is to try to be kind.

24:18.692 --> 24:21.109
You know, Shakespeare said,

24:21.111 --> 24:24.779
"Love all, do wrong to none."

24:24.781 --> 24:27.148
- Shakespeare?
- Yes.

24:27.150 --> 24:29.868
Now, do you think you can be kind

24:29.870 --> 24:31.736
to the silly boy who was mean?

24:31.738 --> 24:34.072
- Mm-hmm.
- And no more hitting.

24:34.074 --> 24:36.157
- Okay.
- Good.

24:36.159 --> 24:37.742
But now it's time for sleep.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.160
Okay.

24:44.635 --> 24:47.969
I thought you should see this, sir.

24:47.971 --> 24:50.138
Found it in the scrapbooks.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.146
Oh, Lord.

25:02.352 --> 25:05.070
We've got to get her back, Harry.

25:05.072 --> 25:08.323
Yes, Major.

[groaning] [grunting]

25:13.066 --> 25:17.032
You've got this all wrong, Harry.
This is no way to carry a piano.

25:17.034 --> 25:19.200
Well, how should we carry it then, sir?

25:19.202 --> 25:20.919
I didn't know you were an expert.

25:20.921 --> 25:22.671
I am not an expert, Harry,

25:22.673 --> 25:24.172
but I know more than you.

25:24.174 --> 25:27.375
Yeah, you know more about complaining.

25:27.377 --> 25:30.211
Harry, I don't like your insolence.

25:30.213 --> 25:32.047
I don't like yours, sir.

25:32.049 --> 25:33.381
Yeah, careful. Careful!

[groaning, shouting]

25:37.304 --> 25:38.720
Look what you made me do!

25:38.722 --> 25:40.221
That was not my fault.

- Jim.

- Jim. Oh, my God.

25:49.816 --> 25:50.949
You all right, Jim?

25:50.951 --> 25:52.984
Steady now. That's it.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.452
Easy as she goes.

25:58.792 --> 26:01.493
I...

26:01.495 --> 26:04.996
I was in the wrong. I lost my temper.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.881
Do you think you can forgive me?

26:06.883 --> 26:08.917
You had your reasons, Walter.

26:08.919 --> 26:12.253
I've let too much of the confusion
in my mind leak out at work.

26:12.255 --> 26:15.840
You see, what you need
to do is compartmentalize.

26:15.842 --> 26:19.094
That's what people who are
talented and disturbed do.

26:19.096 --> 26:21.062
- That's what I do.
- Right.

26:21.064 --> 26:24.149
But I think part of my problem

26:24.151 --> 26:27.685
is that I've always
put women on a pedestal.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.405
I was a mother's boy.

26:30.407 --> 26:32.774
I expect women to be perfect.

26:32.776 --> 26:34.442
And that's not fair.

26:36.113 --> 26:39.293
- I've been too hard on you.
- Yeah. Well, I understand.

- Am I still there?
- Yes.

Sometimes you get off it, but
then you always get back on.
