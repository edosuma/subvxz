How sure are we
your father is in there?

00:17.120 --> 00:19.420
SABINE: Well, our spies
in the capital say he's here,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.750
and they've been
right so far.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.620
Sabine, doesn't it seem
suspicious that the Empire

00:32.620 --> 00:34.880
would move your father
so far from the capital?

00:34.880 --> 00:36.880
SABINE: My father has
many friends.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.830
He's not just
important to me.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.540
The Empire probably
locked him up out here
to prevent someone

00:41.540 --> 00:44.120
from attempting to do
what we're about to do.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.420

but I'd put nothing past

do away with her

I... I cannot
even guarantee

03:19.120 --> 03:20.540
we can hold the tower.

I know how stubborn
Clan Wren can be.

That's why I've dispatched

Where's your father?

05:32.330 --> 05:34.250
The outpost is empty.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.080
There's no one here.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.580
This was a trap set
to lure you in.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.170
Your mother
received this intel,

05:48.170 --> 05:49.880
but she couldn't
get word to you.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.040
The Empire was jamming
all transmissions.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.250

to reinforce you.

she's on her way.

Kanan and Ezra, this is
Lady Bo-Katan of House Kryze.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.210
Her sister, Satine,
once ruled Mandalore.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.420
Bo-Katan was made
regent by the Jedi

06:10.420 --> 06:12.290
before the end
of the Clone War.

06:12.290 --> 06:15.960
She's still seen by many
as Mandalore's rightful ruler.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.250
So what happened?

06:19.250 --> 06:22.330
After the Empire took over,
I refused to obey the Emperor

06:22.330 --> 06:24.750
and was betrayed
by the Saxon clan.

06:28.580 --> 06:32.210
Your commitment
to Mandalore's freedom
is legendary, my lady.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.040
This belongs to you.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.750
I had my chance to rule,
and I failed.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.040
I am not my sister.

I am not the leader
you seek.

You know,
your home planet is
very different from mine.

Once upon a time,
these plains were
covered with grass,

07:39.380 --> 07:42.080
but I never saw it.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.420
This destruction happened
before I was born.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.120
And it never grew back?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.120
Never had a chance to.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.330
This is what
continuous war
has done to my home.

changed their plan.

They're moving
your father back
to the capital

08:24.710 --> 08:26.670

a chance.

you could have
freed him by now.

What's the outlook?

(SIGHS) The Empire is
moving Sabine's father

08:50.420 --> 08:53.000
to the Mandalorian
capital of Sundari.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.920
Only chance
we've got for a rescue
is to ambush the convoy

08:55.920 --> 08:57.420
before it gets there.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.580
What's the status
of the Imperial occupation?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.830
Mandalore is
under complete lockdown.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.210

I'm sorry.

09:04.380 --> 09:06.380

but sounds like
the planet is lost.

is important,

I need you to come back.

overthrowing the Empire
without me?

an important asset
to the rebellion.

about the mission?

no armor in
the center transport,

SABINE: If we attack
the lead vehicle,

10:25.380 --> 10:27.830
my father's transport
will fall back.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.540
Then someone could sneak up
and sabotage its controls,

10:30.540 --> 10:32.250
forcing it to stop.

the rest of the convoy
will be too far ahead

is there a problem
with the prisoner?

The renegades
and their Jedi allies
attacked my convoy

16:34.040 --> 16:36.500
and were able
to liberate Alrich Wren.

They planned well.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.040
Withdraw all
remaining forces.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.920
I am going to deploy
the weapon.

they will all kneel
before The Duchess.

that you had returned,

And...

17:27.750 --> 17:30.830
Sabine,
you are my daughter.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.920
I was pleased then.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.670
Even more now.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.500
Well, we would never
leave you in the hands
of the Empire.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.790
Oh, that was fine.

17:51.790 --> 17:53.960
I meant
your artwork.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.790
You've progressed.

17:55.790 --> 17:57.960
Your use of color
and line is better.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.080
Better?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.670
What do you mean, better?

18:00.670 --> 18:01.960
It's great.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.790
(HESITATING)
It's getting there.

18:04.790 --> 18:06.830
Your design aesthetic
is still derivative

18:06.830 --> 18:08.790
of the Pre-Exile Masters.

18:08.790 --> 18:11.420
Ah, Tojnun was
an influence, obviously,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.210
but I made it my own.

18:13.210 --> 18:15.620
I thought you had
a sharper eye.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.960
Now I see where
Sabine gets her
creative side.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.920
Oh, no, Master Jedi.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.170
Sabine's artistry
comes from her mother.

18:22.170 --> 18:24.120
Ursa knows
how to destroy
her enemies

18:24.120 --> 18:27.500
in so many
creative ways.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.040
And here I thought
we were rescuing
another warrior.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.330
Hmm.

18:31.330 --> 18:34.380
My dad fights
with his art.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.960
We need to get moving.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.750
We're too exposed here.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.750
FENN: Countess Wren,
we've rescued your husband.

18:39.750 --> 18:40.960
Alrich is free.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.790
URSA: Then we have
two victories today.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.880
Saxon's forces
are in retreat.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.960
TRISTAN: Hold on.
They're not all running.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.040
Looks like
we've got an incoming
Imperial transport.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.420
Reinforcements
to cover their retreat?

19:04.420 --> 19:06.330
TRISTAN: They've deployed
a single scout walker,

19:06.330 --> 19:07.920
with no other support.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.540
It's moving into
attack position.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.250
URSA: Laughable.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.750
Destroy it.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.040
(ELECTRONIC HUMMING)

19:14.040 --> 19:16.330
SABINE: That sound...
It can't be.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.420
Tristan, get out of there!

19:19.420 --> 19:20.460
Now!

19:26.880 --> 19:29.080
(LOUD RUMBLING)

19:29.080 --> 19:31.920
Mother? Tristan?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.620
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

19:33.620 --> 19:35.420
What is that?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.040
No...

19:42.710 --> 19:45.330
Let's go, Chop.
(GRUNTING)

20:00.710 --> 20:02.000
No.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.960
No.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.880
What happened here?

20:18.380 --> 20:21.120
Where are the survivors
of this battle,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.960
the wounded, the victors?

20:23.960 --> 20:27.460
I see only the defeated.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.920
Mandalorian armor?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.620
What could do this?

20:37.620 --> 20:39.790
A weapon did this,

20:39.790 --> 20:42.920
a weapon created
by my daughter.
