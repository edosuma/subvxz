"The desire to take medicine
is perhaps the greatest feature...

02:06.342 --> 02:10.536
...which distinguishes man from animals."
Sir William Osler

02:28.700 --> 02:31.100
Feeling low?

02:31.745 --> 02:35.030
Tossing and turning all night?

02:35.249 --> 02:38.593
Having trouble going beddy-bye?

02:38.877 --> 02:42.411
Know what?
You've got a headache.

02:42.631 --> 02:47.777
Try the new painkiller Nipsarin, the
pill 9 out of 10 doctors prescribe,

02:47.877 --> 02:50.671
and get instant relief.

02:54.017 --> 02:57.053
Painful sinuses got you down?

02:58.063 --> 03:02.154
Nasal passages clogging up on you?

03:02.254 --> 03:06.829
Don't give it another thought! Try,
new doctor-prescribed Nauseadrine,

03:06.929 --> 03:09.733
with the new,
magic ingredient N.U. 202,

03:09.833 --> 03:13.392
and smash your troubles away.

03:19.084 --> 03:23.068
Tummy feel crummy? You bet it does!

03:23.297 --> 03:27.105
And there you go,
taking those rotten tablets.

03:27.205 --> 03:29.679
Nothing happens,
they just lay there.

03:29.779 --> 03:33.434
Now watch wonder-working
Garbagine go to work.

03:33.534 --> 03:37.053
See how much faster the new-formula,
better-than-ever

03:37.153 --> 03:41.511
Garbagine tablets are
than that no-good brand.

04:16.058 --> 04:19.461
George, breakfast!

04:24.817 --> 04:27.223
Good morning, Arnold.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.558
Mrs. Kimball?

04:35.869 --> 04:39.521
Hi, Ernie. - Isn't it
a lovely morning? - Oh, it is cute.

04:39.748 --> 04:43.483
Yoghurt, carrot juice, cottage cheese,

04:43.711 --> 04:48.931
organic honey,
non-fat, and eggs, fertile.

04:49.031 --> 04:54.285
The Fishers on Maple St. Got
a new car today. Only it's 2nd hand.

04:54.513 --> 04:58.841
Don't breathe a word of this,
but you know the Bullards?

05:13.407 --> 05:16.940
Now, remember,
don't spread this around.

05:35.554 --> 05:36.954
George!

07:48.187 --> 07:51.506
Hey Nash, it's Vito, the cleaner.

07:53.942 --> 07:56.680
Hey Daddy-O, I got your cleaning.

07:58.530 --> 07:59.530
Ruth!

08:36.652 --> 08:39.390
Need a hand, Mrs. Kimball?

09:03.429 --> 09:06.629
Judy?
- I heard you, you said "ooh."

09:07.808 --> 09:11.673
Doesn't it concern you,
I have this pain in my chest?

09:11.895 --> 09:14.669
I'm always concerned.

09:15.941 --> 09:20.518
It's just that I've had such
a morning. You would not believe it.

09:20.738 --> 09:24.437
I called Dr. Morrissey.
I'm going to have a complete check-up.

09:24.658 --> 09:29.650
It's probably nothing serious.
- But you just had one 2 weeks ago!

09:29.872 --> 09:33.523
In 2 weeks a body can turn on you.
Just like that.

09:33.751 --> 09:37.533
While it's turning, eat breakfast.
- Not until Ralph looks me over.

09:37.755 --> 09:42.830
At least have a piece of toast.
It won't show up in the X-ray.

09:43.052 --> 09:48.494
It's roughage.
- I don't know why I bother to cook.

09:48.724 --> 09:51.331
Well, maybe one piece of toast.

09:57.441 --> 10:01.092
Have I got something to tell you!
Guess what.

10:03.489 --> 10:06.440
The Bullards are getting a divorce.

10:06.658 --> 10:11.520
The Bullards?
- The milkman told me. - Who are they?

10:11.747 --> 10:15.363
They live on the next block.
I don't know them,

10:15.584 --> 10:17.860
but I expected it.

10:18.087 --> 10:20.956
You did? Although you don't know them?

10:22.049 --> 10:26.329
I know all about them.
Marjorie told me at bridge.

10:26.553 --> 10:31.711
That poor thing! There must be
really something wrong with him.

10:31.934 --> 10:35.384
How do you know? Maybe
there's something wrong with her.

10:35.604 --> 10:41.095
Oh, no. She's very nice.
I met her at the supermarket.

10:41.420 --> 10:46.615
She may be nice at the supermarket,
but not nice at home.

10:46.842 --> 10:51.870
You know ... - No butter!
It's loaded with cholesterol.

10:52.097 --> 10:57.173
2 years ago you'd never heard
of cholesterol. Now it's a big thing!

10:57.394 --> 11:02.470
Laugh if you want, but men my age
are dropping like flies!

11:02.691 --> 11:06.343
Do you read the obituary page?
It's enough to scare you to death.

11:06.570 --> 11:10.850
Then why do you read it?
- Should I bury my head in the sand?

11:11.075 --> 11:15.688
No. But why do you think you have
every disease you hear about?

11:16.205 --> 11:18.113
What do you mean by that?

11:18.833 --> 11:24.454
Come on! Remember
when they operated on Whitey Ford?

11:24.672 --> 11:28.205
You thought
you had bone chips in your elbow.

11:28.801 --> 11:32.666
There definitely was pain there.

11:34.139 --> 11:36.249
Your hypochondria's showing.

11:37.226 --> 11:40.510
I am not a hypochondriac.
Listen,

11:40.855 --> 11:45.882
someday when I'm lying in hospital,
then you'll change your tune.

11:47.987 --> 11:52.765
You better hurry,
you'll miss your train. Bye!

11:53.993 --> 11:56.648
What's today?
- Friday.

11:56.871 --> 12:01.863
Maybe I better cancel lunch
with Winston Burr, the way I feel...

12:03.377 --> 12:07.112
Darling,
I think you could risk a cup of tea.

12:10.092 --> 12:15.452
I don't suppose a cup of weak tea
would hurt me, whatever's wrong.

12:19.476 --> 12:23.626
Your call to Mrs. Bullard, Mr. Burr.
- Thank you. - Bullard?

12:23.856 --> 12:27.341
Is she the one getting a divorce?
- Yeah. How did you know?

12:27.568 --> 12:30.437
We have the same milkman.
- Watch this,

12:30.654 --> 12:35.066
the Winston Burr patented procedure
for potential divorcees:

12:35.868 --> 12:37.811
Hello, Linda.

12:38.037 --> 12:41.072
Winston. Winny Burr.

12:41.290 --> 12:46.448
Linda, I heard the horrible news.
Well, I'm just heartbroken.

12:46.670 --> 12:51.698
Yeah. I always considered
you and David my best friends.

12:52.092 --> 12:56.421
If there's anything I can do,
you mustn't hesitate to call me.

12:56.639 --> 13:01.050
Yeah. The next couple of weeks
are going to be very tough.

13:01.268 --> 13:04.505
You'll be... lonely.

13:04.730 --> 13:09.426
Yeah. Say, why don't we have
a quiet little drink together tonight?

13:09.652 --> 13:14.561
Maybe I could think of something
to bring you and David back together.

13:15.074 --> 13:20.019
Okay, I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.
Tonight. How's that?

13:20.246 --> 13:23.363
Alright, little darling.
And... cheer up.

13:27.545 --> 13:32.822
You are a 100%,
non-shrinkable, no-money-back ratfink!

13:34.093 --> 13:36.700
Yeah, but a bachelor ratfink.

13:38.848 --> 13:42.499
I'll see you at the club tomorrow.
Good luck with your doctor.

13:42.726 --> 13:44.836
Check, please!

13:57.867 --> 14:00.190
Ooh boy, am I pooped!

14:02.246 --> 14:05.233
I made 8 house calls this morning.

14:05.457 --> 14:09.655
Why in blazes didn't I specialize,
so I could get some sleep?

14:09.879 --> 14:12.748
Like those lucky allergists.

14:12.965 --> 14:17.376
They keep hours just like a banker,
and make the same kind of money, too.

14:17.595 --> 14:23.915
I know one of them, built a
$100,000 house on ragweed alone.

14:24.143 --> 14:27.095
When the pollen count goes up,
just like the stock market...

14:27.313 --> 14:31.462
Ralph, I have this pain...
- Thank goodness it's Friday.

14:31.692 --> 14:36.637
I'm going fishing this weekend.
A friend of mine has a cabin cruiser.

14:36.864 --> 14:41.062
Gastroenterologist. He'd look
at anything but gall bladders.

14:41.285 --> 14:44.569
He is absolutely cleaning up.

14:44.788 --> 14:47.526
You'll be on a boat the whole weekend?
- That's right.

14:47.750 --> 14:52.244
Can't you be reached in an emergency?
- Emergency?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.119
What emergency?

14:55.341 --> 15:01.413
No, 90% of my patients have
absolutely nothing wrong with them.

15:01.639 --> 15:06.417
And the 10% that have
something seriously wrong,

15:06.644 --> 15:10.094
I send them to a specialist.

15:11.190 --> 15:14.723
Now, what is the trouble?
- What?

15:14.944 --> 15:18.762
Oh, well, I have this pain...
- Can you show me

15:18.989 --> 15:23.483
where it is? - Right here. It hurts
like the Devil when I press it.

15:23.702 --> 15:27.651
Then don't press it.
Now George,

15:27.873 --> 15:31.822
tell me, is it a sharp pain,
is it a dull pain,

15:32.044 --> 15:34.616
or does it grip, like a vice?
- Yes.

15:34.839 --> 15:36.616
No. Pick one.

15:39.468 --> 15:42.586
I'd say it was more of a sharp pain.

15:43.556 --> 15:46.543
I guess we'd better take a listen.

15:46.767 --> 15:51.629
Do you have any idea what it might be?
- Not yet.

15:51.856 --> 15:57.263
It's probably nothing serious.
You know how Judy worries.

16:01.657 --> 16:04.099
Take a deep breath.

16:04.326 --> 16:05.726
Exhale.

16:07.913 --> 16:09.313
Inhale.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.607
Exhale.

16:16.797 --> 16:18.197
Inhale.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.452
Exhale.

16:34.940 --> 16:39.802
You can button up now, George.
- What's the bad news?

16:40.029 --> 16:44.606
What? - This pain in my chest,
is there a medical term for it?

16:45.117 --> 16:46.117
Yes.

16:47.328 --> 16:49.686
It's called indigestion.

16:49.914 --> 16:52.023
I want you to take

16:52.249 --> 16:56.696
these pills. One before each meal
and again before retiring.

16:56.921 --> 17:01.201
What kind of pills are they?
- You wouldn't know if I told you.

17:03.093 --> 17:07.077
Oh, Ralph...
That cardiogram you took...

17:07.306 --> 17:11.835
Yeah, what about it?
- That's what I was going to ask.

17:12.060 --> 17:15.012
What are you talking about?
- How did it turn out?

17:15.231 --> 17:18.964
I don't know. The results aren't due
from Dr. Peterson for another week.

17:19.193 --> 17:21.931
He's had it for 2 weeks.

17:22.154 --> 17:27.230
Isn't he studying it for a long time?
- Dr. Peterson is a very busy man.

17:28.077 --> 17:32.855
Biggest cardiologist in the city.
Got a regular goldmine there.

17:33.082 --> 17:36.781
Well, in your opinion,
everything is Okay?

17:37.962 --> 17:41.412
George, you are sound as a bell.

17:41.632 --> 17:47.171
I wish all my patients
were as healthy as you are.

17:47.388 --> 17:52.048
Speaking non-professionally, that is.
- And this pain in my chest?

17:52.268 --> 17:54.674
I can just live a normal life?
- I would.

17:54.895 --> 17:58.262
You can take
one of those pills now if you want.

17:58.482 --> 18:02.597
Right now? Is it so urgent?
- It doesn't make any difference.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.887
No, I'll take it now
if it's that important.

18:12.204 --> 18:15.109
Is that my chart, Ralph?

18:16.750 --> 18:20.734
Aren't you writing an awful lot
for just indigestion?

18:20.963 --> 18:25.327
The more I write,
the more money I charge.

18:25.551 --> 18:26.866
Oh, good.

18:33.058 --> 18:36.758
Hello? Oh yes, he is, Doctor.

18:50.659 --> 18:55.936
I appreciate how busy you've been.
That's why I didn't press you on it.

18:56.165 --> 18:58.156
Whose cardiogram?

18:58.542 --> 19:00.651
William Mallone's?

19:00.878 --> 19:05.539
Yes, I've been worried about him.
He's getting on in years.

19:06.383 --> 19:09.787
What does
the cardiogram show, Dr. Peterson?

19:10.638 --> 19:11.638
What?

19:13.265 --> 19:15.422
Oh, that's really a shame.

19:15.643 --> 19:20.386
But, still, what can you do?
Give him a few pills

19:20.606 --> 19:24.140
to ease the pain in his chest.

19:25.820 --> 19:30.064
Not much you can do
when the old ticker goes, eh?

19:31.450 --> 19:36.193
How much time do you figure he's got,
Doctor? Few weeks.

19:37.957 --> 19:42.024
Yes, I've seen them go just like that.

19:43.629 --> 19:48.824
No, I'm not going to tell him.
I think he's better off not knowing.

19:49.051 --> 19:50.330
Alright.

19:50.553 --> 19:57.087
Fine, you have a nice weekend too,
Doctor. Bye-bye.

20:08.988 --> 20:12.105
I'm back, Ralph.
- Good.

20:16.704 --> 20:22.064
Do you still want me to take these
pills? - Yes, to ease your chest pain.

20:25.045 --> 20:26.245
Ralph?

20:27.923 --> 20:31.872
Do you mind
if I ask you some questions?

20:32.094 --> 20:35.663
Not at all, go ahead.
- Well,

20:35.890 --> 20:39.293
suppose you had a patient

20:39.518 --> 20:42.838
and found out
he only had a few weeks to live.

20:43.063 --> 20:46.632
I mean, he could go just like that.

20:46.859 --> 20:50.558
Would you tell him?
- Well, offhand I would say, but

20:50.779 --> 20:54.431
it'd all depend on the circumstances.
- Circumstances? - Yes.

20:54.658 --> 20:59.651
If I knew the man's affairs
were in order, his will made out,

20:59.872 --> 21:06.027
his insurance paid up, no loose ends,
well, I'd see no reason to tell him.

21:06.879 --> 21:11.290
Well, suppose he were an old friend,
like me.

21:11.509 --> 21:15.789
Are your affairs in order,
will made out, insurance paid up?

21:16.013 --> 21:20.875
The I wouldn't tell you. Anything else
I can do for you, George?

21:27.149 --> 21:29.472
Goodbye, Mr. Kimball.

21:33.155 --> 21:35.929
See you in church!

21:42.540 --> 21:44.740
Judy?
Yeah?

21:45.960 --> 21:50.323
Come on, we're teeing off at 2:30.
- Just a second. - What are you doing?

21:50.548 --> 21:54.413
Making George's sleeping pills.
- What are you, a pharmacist?

21:54.635 --> 21:58.038
I'm a very smart wife.
You know George.

21:58.264 --> 22:02.793
He's convinced he can't sleep
without a pill, but I know it's sugar.

22:03.018 --> 22:06.385
And it works? - It has for 5 years.
You know something else?

22:06.605 --> 22:10.720
When he takes two
he goes to sleep twice as fast.

22:10.943 --> 22:14.559
That's a story for a medical journal!
- That'd ruin everything. - Why?

22:14.780 --> 22:17.649
He reads it every week.
- Oh, no!

22:25.166 --> 22:27.323
Hi, George.
- Hello, Arnold.

22:27.543 --> 22:32.654
Ruth is flying to her mother's,
the kids are in camp, and I'm alone.

22:33.716 --> 22:35.992
And unafraid.

22:36.844 --> 22:39.713
What are you doing?
- Eating.

22:40.139 --> 22:44.123
Nuts? George Kimball? Cholesterol?

22:45.603 --> 22:49.337
What's the matter?
You seem kind of down.

22:51.859 --> 22:57.266
Arnold, can I take you into my
confidence? - You can, George.

22:58.032 --> 23:02.276
Well,
I've just heard some rather bad news.

23:02.495 --> 23:07.522
You've got to promise to keep quiet.
I wouldn't want it to get around.

23:07.750 --> 23:12.659
It's nothing that's going to
affect property values, is it?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.989
No, I wouldn't think so.

23:15.674 --> 23:19.374
That's a relief. What, then?

23:19.595 --> 23:23.543
You know this little pain in my chest
I've been complaining about?

23:23.766 --> 23:28.260
You mean your indigestion?
- Well, it's not indigestion.

23:29.104 --> 23:30.104
No?

23:31.065 --> 23:33.970
It's curtains, Arnold.

23:34.193 --> 23:35.508
Curtains?

23:36.362 --> 23:39.682
What do you mean, "curtains"?
- I just came from the doctor's.

23:39.907 --> 23:43.476
He only gives me a few weeks to live.
- Oh, come on!

23:49.166 --> 23:53.364
I don't believe it.
- It's true. It's the ticker.

23:55.047 --> 23:56.847
Holy cow!

23:58.634 --> 24:01.434
Are they sure?

24:01.720 --> 24:04.768
I had Peterson,
the biggest cardiologist in the city.

24:06.308 --> 24:08.477
Holy cow!

24:10.271 --> 24:15.049
Gee, George,
I don't know what to say.

24:15.276 --> 24:18.809
This is so sudden, you...

24:19.446 --> 24:23.395
George, I...
I believe I better have a drink.

24:23.617 --> 24:27.067
I'd like to have one with you,
if you don't mind.

24:27.288 --> 24:29.527
Certainly not.

24:48.392 --> 24:52.969
I'd like a martini.
- Same. Double.

24:56.025 --> 24:58.264
George?
- What?

25:01.030 --> 25:04.396
How are you going to tell Judy?
- Judy?

25:05.075 --> 25:09.819
Oh, I'm not going to tell her. - No?
- No. I couldn't bear it.

25:10.039 --> 25:14.568
She'd probably go to pieces,
all that weeping and wailing.

25:14.793 --> 25:18.825
You know Judy. - Yeah, I remember
how she was when the dog died.

25:19.048 --> 25:24.325
I don't mean there'd be a comparison.
This would be much worse.

25:25.179 --> 25:27.537
You know what I mean.

25:28.390 --> 25:33.466
Of course, Arnold.
- George, is there anything I can do?

25:33.687 --> 25:37.755
Not as a lawyer, but as
your best friend. - I don't know.

25:37.983 --> 25:42.015
Somebody has to
take care of the funeral details.

25:42.738 --> 25:44.895
Do you want to do that?
- I'll do it.

25:47.243 --> 25:49.103
I'll do it.

26:29.451 --> 26:32.771
What's the matter with him?
- It's so nice to see you.

26:32.997 --> 26:35.439
It's good to see you, George.

26:41.172 --> 26:44.159
How is everything?
- Everything's just fine.

26:44.383 --> 26:47.370
That's wonderful, wonderful.

26:49.555 --> 26:52.424
Hi, Arnold. - Hi.
- Ruth get off alright?

26:52.641 --> 26:55.511
Like a rocket.
- Good.

26:55.728 --> 26:57.920
How are you, Judy?

26:59.565 --> 27:02.517
What are you taking,
George's vitamin pills?

27:03.944 --> 27:07.727
Dear, I want you to know you can
always count on me. - Thanks, Arnold.

27:07.948 --> 27:12.526
I think we should drive Arnold home.
He can pick up his car tomorrow.

27:13.370 --> 27:17.734
Judy, do you know
what type of man you're married to?

27:17.958 --> 27:21.942
Thinking of the other guy, even at
a time like this. - A time like this?

27:24.048 --> 27:28.162
He means, at a time when
he forgets where he parked his car.

27:29.011 --> 27:32.247
You can ride with us, Arnie. Come on.

27:34.225 --> 27:36.583
That was brilliant.

27:54.787 --> 27:56.529
Come on, Arnold.

28:17.101 --> 28:21.714
Judy, I just wanted to tell you,
I live right next door, alright?

28:21.939 --> 28:26.765
Right, Arnold. - If you need me
for anything, day or night,

28:26.986 --> 28:29.807
that's where I'll be, right next door.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.982
Thanks a lot, Arnold.

28:44.211 --> 28:47.412
Oh, was he bombed.
What's he had to drink?

28:47.631 --> 28:51.496
Hello, Mrs. Kimball. For you
we put it through special.

28:51.719 --> 28:56.877
That is something! Almost as wild
as this morning's outfit, huh?

28:57.099 --> 28:58.899
Bye, now.

28:59.602 --> 29:02.803
Pretty fresh kid.
- Oh, he's just friendly.

29:03.022 --> 29:05.724
Friendly? Bet he makes out
pretty good in this neighborhood.

29:08.486 --> 29:12.683
Oh, darling? Joe at the gas station
gave me back this check.

29:12.907 --> 29:17.235
He said it's the wrong amount
and I should make out a new one.

29:17.453 --> 29:22.860
The bill was 45.58 and,
I don't know why, but I wrote 78.60.

29:23.083 --> 29:29.536
The figure's not $78.60, it's 7-8-6-0.
You paid your license plate!

29:29.757 --> 29:33.408
You're kidding. That's an odd one.

29:34.678 --> 29:40.335
Now, anybody can make a mistake...
- I'd like to talk to you. Judy?

29:40.559 --> 29:42.598
How would you like
to go to night school?

29:43.979 --> 29:48.094
Where? - Night school.
Just a couple of nights a week.

29:48.317 --> 29:51.851
To learn banking,
bookkeeping, a little accounting.

29:52.071 --> 29:56.434
That's just... Why? - Because
these things keep our ship afloat.

29:56.659 --> 30:01.153
For example: What does
"amortization of a mortgage" mean?

30:01.372 --> 30:04.323
I don't care.
- But you've got to care.

30:04.542 --> 30:07.493
That's your department.
- But it's important for you to know.

30:07.711 --> 30:10.829
Why should we both know the
same things? - Judy, please.

30:11.048 --> 30:14.126
Will you let me get dinner going?
- That's what I want to talk about.

30:14.385 --> 30:18.748
How much is a pound of ham?
- I don't know, I didn't buy a pound.

30:18.973 --> 30:22.458
How much did you buy? - A half pound.
- How much was it?

30:22.685 --> 30:25.636
If I don't know that either.

30:25.855 --> 30:29.258
How do you know they're not cheating
you, if you don't know the prices?

30:29.483 --> 30:32.720
Would you tell me why you're
getting so worked up about ham?

30:32.945 --> 30:39.100
It's not just ham,
it's the whole principle.

30:42.913 --> 30:47.656
George, you didn't lose your job?
- No, I didn't lose my job.

30:47.877 --> 30:53.201
I'll have it the rest of my life.
- Then what are you worried about?

30:53.424 --> 30:57.324
You better check on Arnold.
See if he wants to have dinner, huh?

30:57.553 --> 31:00.042
We can eat in half an hour.

31:08.022 --> 31:11.258
What does "amortization" mean?

31:22.661 --> 31:28.069
Hindus had the right idea. When
the husband died, the wife went too.

31:28.292 --> 31:32.324
Threw herself on the funeral pyre.
And he didn't have to worry about her.

31:32.546 --> 31:36.329
I've been thinking, and
I want to do this, so don't say no.

31:36.550 --> 31:41.958
Fact is, I consider it a privilege.
- What? - I want to deliver a eulogy.

31:42.181 --> 31:47.090
That'd be fine. - And don't worry,
I'll give you one gorgeous send-off.

31:47.311 --> 31:51.758
I'm sure you will. Just wish
I could be around to hear it.

31:51.982 --> 31:54.815
Maybe I can knock out
a rough draft before you go.

31:56.362 --> 32:00.511
You know something, Arnold?
Judy will never make alone.

32:00.741 --> 32:04.357
Look at it this way, George:

32:04.578 --> 32:09.606
Judy's young, she's attractive,
she'll probably get married again.

32:10.459 --> 32:12.118
I'm sorry,

32:12.336 --> 32:15.952
I shouldn't say a thing like that,
with you not gone yet.

32:16.173 --> 32:18.247
It's alright, Arnold.

32:18.467 --> 32:24.006
Of course it's a possibility.
Judy might get married again.

32:24.223 --> 32:28.041
Suppose she married the wrong man,
like poor Janet Hart. Remember her?

32:28.561 --> 32:32.675
Who? - Janet and Bill Hart.
Don't you remember? - No.

32:32.898 --> 32:38.259
After Bill died Janet needed somebody
to lean on, so she took the first guy.

32:38.487 --> 32:42.519
One week after the funeral
she ran off with a bongo player.

32:42.741 --> 32:44.484
A bongo player?
- Yeah.

32:44.702 --> 32:47.938
Took her for every cent.
- Is that going to happen to Judy?

32:48.164 --> 32:52.741
Who knows? She could turn to the first
man that comes along. - Holy cow!

32:52.960 --> 32:56.410
Arnold? There's no question:

32:56.630 --> 33:02.750
Judy should marry again, but to
the right man. I've got to find him.

33:05.181 --> 33:07.836
Another husband? Who, George?

33:08.058 --> 33:10.251
I don't know. I'll find somebody.

33:11.645 --> 33:13.921
I'm a married man, George.

33:14.148 --> 33:19.769
Not you. Woods must be
full of eligible bachelors.

33:49.141 --> 33:52.461
Did it come yet, baby?
- What, mio amore?

33:52.686 --> 33:56.302
The 50 thou,
the old boy's life insurance.

34:02.071 --> 34:04.477
Is that enough, Vito?
- For now.

34:04.698 --> 34:08.896
If we need more we can sell the joint.

34:43.779 --> 34:46.684
Mr. Kimball is here, Mr. Atkins.

34:46.907 --> 34:50.310
You phoned us about
the purchase of a final resting place.

34:50.536 --> 34:53.025
Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

34:53.246 --> 34:57.860
This has been a busy morning.
Did you see the Archers? - Who?

34:58.294 --> 35:01.779
The Archers on Meadow Rd.
Do you know them? - I don't think so.

35:02.256 --> 35:07.248
They're a family of 8. They
were all in. Wonderful to see them.

35:07.469 --> 35:10.540
You don't get
those big families anymore.

35:11.182 --> 35:17.218
I can understand your point of view.
- Do you know Green Hills? - Pardon?

35:17.438 --> 35:20.722
Do you have anyone residing with us?
- Not as yet.

35:20.941 --> 35:25.221
You saw our advertising campaign.
- No, I must have missed it.

35:25.446 --> 35:29.975
I think I have a copy somewhere.
Oh, there it is.

35:30.201 --> 35:32.393
There she be.

35:33.579 --> 35:36.151
Sure hits you in the eye, doesn't it?

35:36.582 --> 35:39.273
Yes, it sure does.
- We suggest

35:39.502 --> 35:43.450
the entire family all go out
and select the final resting place.

35:43.672 --> 35:47.491
The kids love it. They have a ball!
- I'll bet they do.

35:47.718 --> 35:53.541
If you'll notice, all monuments
in Green Hills are the same height,

35:53.766 --> 35:58.213
4 feet. As you see, it gives
a wonderful impression of uniformity.

35:58.979 --> 36:01.136
A sort of Levittown of the hereafter.

36:02.650 --> 36:05.050
I like that.

36:05.903 --> 36:09.519
"The Levittown of..." - Mr. Atkins,
could we get down to business?

36:09.740 --> 36:14.187
Yes Siree-Bob.
As soon as I find the old order pad.

36:14.411 --> 36:16.403
Here we are!

36:16.622 --> 36:19.823
Now, how many in your family,
Mr. Kimball?

36:20.042 --> 36:22.531
Just my wife and myself.

36:23.879 --> 36:25.988
Oh, well. That's alright.

36:27.258 --> 36:30.162
Chance of any little additions, maybe?

36:31.011 --> 36:33.785
Well, there might be
another man along later.

36:34.974 --> 36:36.419
I beg your pardon.

36:36.642 --> 36:39.677
Mr. Atkins, let me ask you a question.

36:39.895 --> 36:44.923
Assuming the husband goes first,
and then later on the wife remarries.

36:46.694 --> 36:51.603
Then the wife goes next, and she's
buried alongside her first husband.

36:53.284 --> 36:57.481
When the second husband goes,
is he buried alongside the other two?

36:57.705 --> 37:00.193
I mean, are they all put in together?

37:01.667 --> 37:03.824
Yes, that happens.

37:04.044 --> 37:07.198
Well, make it for three.

37:07.423 --> 37:10.114
Alrighty, reservations for three.

37:10.676 --> 37:15.004
Now, how much is this?
- $1,000. - $1,000?

37:15.222 --> 37:18.507
We throw in the 1st year's gardening.
How's that get you?

37:19.977 --> 37:21.177
Swell.

37:22.480 --> 37:28.136
I'd like write the check to cash.
- Suit yourself.

37:29.403 --> 37:33.138
You see, I'd rather
my wife didn't know about this.

37:34.617 --> 37:37.308
You want to surprise her.
- Yes.

37:37.536 --> 37:40.227
This'll give her a real thrill!

37:40.456 --> 37:44.274
It makes a very thoughtful gift.
Let me show you.

37:45.044 --> 37:48.364
We've got a lovely layout.

37:50.299 --> 37:53.950
I think we'll put you in K-1, 2 and 3.

37:54.178 --> 37:58.245
Sunset Hill,
right next to Folded Wings.

37:58.474 --> 38:01.081
Oh, you're lucky.

38:01.310 --> 38:04.511
That's nice high ground.
Lovely view from here.

38:04.730 --> 38:08.014
Sounds marvellous.
- It's a honey.

38:08.234 --> 38:13.724
When is it available? - It's kept
in tip-top shape at all times.

38:13.948 --> 38:16.555
Whenever you're ready,

38:16.784 --> 38:20.483
we're ready.
- That's comforting.

38:22.873 --> 38:28.198
Thank you, Mr. Atkins. - There's one
more thing I think you should know.

38:28.420 --> 38:33.199
What's that? - It's not of immediate
concern, but there are plans

38:33.425 --> 38:37.575
for a state highway
that would go through Green Hills.

38:37.805 --> 38:41.705
A state highway? - Not until 1980,
and that's not definite.

38:41.934 --> 38:45.918
But in the event it does
come to pass, we'll see to everything

38:46.147 --> 38:50.510
at our expense. - What does that mean?
- We'll either move you

38:50.734 --> 38:54.303
or, if you wish,
put you deeper under the freeway.

38:55.086 --> 38:56.283
I see.

38:57.283 --> 39:01.141
Either way,
whatever the others do, I'll go along.

39:01.308 --> 39:02.810
Fine and dandy.

39:03.038 --> 39:05.640
I'll get the deed to you
in a day or so.

39:07.722 --> 39:13.920
You really enjoy your work, don't you?
- I wouldn't want to do anything else.

39:14.800 --> 39:20.505
I like people.
- Well, goodbye. - Oh, Mr. Kimball!

39:21.933 --> 39:23.757
Your green stamps.

39:26.562 --> 39:30.926
I'll change. Meet you in 15 minutes.
- I don't think I'll play today.

39:31.150 --> 39:33.924
Oh, George!
- No, I don't think I'd better.

39:34.153 --> 39:38.849
Oh honey, I hate to play alone.
- I'll meet you on the ninth green.

39:39.075 --> 39:40.075
Okay.

39:53.089 --> 39:56.539
Arnold, I did it.
- Yeah?

39:56.759 --> 40:02.665
I bought a cemetery plot.
- Good. Use it in good health.

40:02.890 --> 40:07.135
I'm sorry.
I'm not in very good shape today.

40:07.353 --> 40:11.052
I've just one more thing to attend to,
then I'll stop this gallivanting,

40:11.274 --> 40:15.174
and go to bed and wait.
- What's that?

40:15.403 --> 40:17.928
A husband for Judy. Look:

40:18.156 --> 40:21.689
I made a list of all
the eligible bachelors around here.

40:21.909 --> 40:25.977
Good morning Arnold, George.
- Hi. - Hi, Sam.

40:26.205 --> 40:29.821
How about old Sam Scheffing?
- He hasn't got a quarter.

40:30.042 --> 40:35.118
Never could stand him, anyway.
- Judy needs a wealthy man.

40:35.339 --> 40:38.457
How about Paul Pendergrass?
He's playing tennis here today.

40:43.931 --> 40:46.753
He's reasonably good-looking.

40:48.144 --> 40:50.550
Not as reasonable as you, but...

41:07.955 --> 41:09.436
I'm sorry.

41:12.668 --> 41:14.778
There's Harry Hanson.

41:15.713 --> 41:19.863
Plays a great handicap. Two.
Is he on your list? - No.

41:20.092 --> 41:24.421
Put him on the list. Fine competitor.

41:34.482 --> 41:35.482
Fore!

41:38.277 --> 41:42.807
You're a fraud, Harry Hanson!
- Shh, quiet. Sit down and be quiet.

41:43.032 --> 41:47.182
You should be exposed!
- Come on, let's find Judy.

42:07.431 --> 42:10.751
It's a little discouraging, isn't it?
- A bit.

42:10.977 --> 42:15.009
I said it yesterday:
The woods are full of them.

42:15.231 --> 42:19.844
What woods, George?
- What's the difference? Any woods.

42:22.071 --> 42:25.581
What's that?
- Time for my pill.

42:26.200 --> 42:29.401
It hardly seems
worthwhile to take a pill.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.988
I'm sorry, George.

42:42.136 --> 42:44.661
Help! Look out, George!

42:46.849 --> 42:48.425
Look out, George!

42:48.643 --> 42:51.548
Judy, wait! Arnold, hurry.

42:53.147 --> 42:55.139
No, go that way.

43:11.207 --> 43:13.067
Faster, Arnold!

43:14.669 --> 43:16.197
Look out!

43:21.259 --> 43:24.828
I can't stop! I'm sorry.

43:31.602 --> 43:34.673
Somebody, stop this thing!

43:34.897 --> 43:37.054
Step on it!
- I am!

43:49.954 --> 43:52.941
Thank you.
- It's alright, you're safe now.

44:00.173 --> 44:02.946
What's the matter with you?

44:07.388 --> 44:10.162
Now, just a minute...
- Judy!

44:12.018 --> 44:13.018
Bert!

44:13.811 --> 44:17.048
Bert Power!
- Judy Heppleway!

44:21.194 --> 44:26.732
Gosh, you look pretty as ever!
- I'm sure I look terrible!

44:26.949 --> 44:31.692
Judy Heppleway.
- George, George Kimball!

44:31.913 --> 44:34.983
Maybe we should go, we're intruding.
- Bert,

44:35.208 --> 44:40.319
meet my husband George and our
good friend and neighbor Arnold Nash.

44:40.546 --> 44:45.989
Fellas, this is Bert Power, my
college ... - Sweetheart. Hi, Arnold.

44:46.219 --> 44:49.752
George. - Oh, excuse me,
I thought you were the good friend.

44:49.972 --> 44:53.847
I'm not her good friend,
I'm her husband. For now, anyway.

44:54.018 --> 44:56.886
So, you married little Judy Heppleway.

44:57.563 --> 45:02.888
Yes, I did. - No offence.
Judy was always the campus queen.

45:03.111 --> 45:06.746
I figured she'd wind up marrying
someone like Cary Grant.

45:08.574 --> 45:12.523
No, she just married me.
- I think she did just fine.

45:12.745 --> 45:18.188
So do I. - And so do I.
- Little Judy Heppleway.

45:18.418 --> 45:23.576
If you don't mind, her name's Kimball,
because she married me.

45:23.798 --> 45:28.790
Now, that's a perfectly good name.
- Bertie, what are you doing here?

45:29.011 --> 45:33.541
Just flew in from Phoenix for
a little business swindle. - Swindle?

45:33.766 --> 45:37.750
You should put on dry clothes.
Let's go to your little country club

45:37.979 --> 45:40.752
and some lunch, so we
can really talk. - Oh, marvellous!

45:40.982 --> 45:44.681
I'm so glad to see you.
- Are we invited too?

45:45.653 --> 45:48.605
Oh, sure, come along.
- Come on, George.

45:56.330 --> 46:02.366
Tell me, what do you do these days?
- As a matter of fact, I'm in oil.

46:02.587 --> 46:05.029
Oil? Isn't it fascinating?

46:05.256 --> 46:07.579
It's marvellous tax-wise.

46:07.800 --> 46:12.627
The first 27.5 percent
go right into your pocket. - Really?

46:12.847 --> 46:18.124
People always belly-aching about
needing money should all get into oil.

46:18.352 --> 46:21.589
It would certainly wipe out poverty.

46:22.148 --> 46:24.921
What's your line of business, George?

46:25.151 --> 46:30.262
I'm with Connell Electronics.
- Are you on the big board? - No.

46:30.698 --> 46:32.642
We're not on the little board either.

46:33.201 --> 46:36.734
It's a small company,
Bert, but it's very important.

46:36.954 --> 46:40.358
They manufacture a little transistor
about this big.

46:40.583 --> 46:42.383
This big.

46:43.795 --> 46:46.568
Anyway,
as George said in a speech once:

46:46.798 --> 46:50.164
Without it, a whole city
like Pittsburgh would be blacked out.

46:50.384 --> 46:54.713
From what I've seen of Pittsburgh,
it'd look better blacked out.

46:54.931 --> 46:59.793
It's true. - Tell me, Bert,
did your wife come with you?

47:00.019 --> 47:01.837
My wife? I'm not married.

47:02.105 --> 47:05.638
What? Bert Power, I don't believe you.
- Well, it's true.

47:05.858 --> 47:09.095
How did you escape?
- Well, if you really must know,

47:09.320 --> 47:11.596
it's partly your fault, passion girl.

47:12.407 --> 47:13.649
Mine?
- Yeah.

47:14.075 --> 47:17.608
After you threw me over
I couldn't settle for second-best.

47:17.829 --> 47:21.861
Excuse me, please.
I'll powder my nose. George,

47:22.625 --> 47:26.739
your nose needs a little powder too.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:32.927 --> 47:36.578
I'll be right back. Why don't you
order for me, passion girl?

47:36.806 --> 47:40.790
I'd like the chef salad,
vinegar, no oil.

47:46.107 --> 47:49.557
What is it? - Our worries are over.
- What? - We found a man for Judy.

47:49.777 --> 47:50.777
Who?

47:51.320 --> 47:54.356
Who? Bert Power, of course.

47:54.574 --> 47:59.352
Are you mad? Judy, married to
that cornball? Why, I'd live first!

47:59.579 --> 48:04.108
Judy doesn't think he's a cornball.
And he's loaded, George, loaded!

48:04.333 --> 48:07.511
Do you want everybody here to know?
- How much time do you have to look?

48:07.611 --> 48:10.360
I'm sorry. But,
even if you find somebody you like,

48:10.590 --> 48:15.535
how do you know he'll go for Judy?
- Are you kidding? That's impossible.

48:15.762 --> 48:20.505
Nothing's impossible. Two girls
turned me down before Ruth said yes.

48:20.725 --> 48:23.712
One even laughed in my face.

48:25.396 --> 48:26.796
Well...

48:30.860 --> 48:34.394
It should make Judy happy.

48:37.533 --> 48:39.109
And you know...

48:39.327 --> 48:44.687
Welcome back, gentlemen.
- Glad to be back, Bert old man.

48:45.541 --> 48:48.411
There's a dinner dance here tonight.

48:48.628 --> 48:52.492
Why don't you come along
as my and Judy's guest?

48:53.132 --> 48:58.575
That's very kind of you,
considering I'm not even deductible.

48:59.750 --> 49:02.785
I'll take care of the champagne.
- Great!

49:03.100 --> 49:05.043
Just great!

49:05.894 --> 49:10.258
I've never seen anything greater
than Bert's backhand.

49:10.482 --> 49:15.640
And those drives off the tee,
every one was over 350 yards.

49:15.863 --> 49:19.064
Wasn't it a pleasure,
playing bridge with him?

49:19.283 --> 49:22.852
Did you ever see
such a polished player? - Oh,

49:23.078 --> 49:26.612
he's alright.
- Alright?

49:26.832 --> 49:31.445
Why are you acting so nonchalant?
You were very happy to see him.

49:31.670 --> 49:33.910
Of course I was happy,

49:34.256 --> 49:38.536
very surprised. - Come on,
you couldn't keep your eyes off him.

49:38.761 --> 49:42.626
How could I help it? He was there
all afternoon. Remember, darling,

49:42.848 --> 49:47.840
it was your suggestion
to play tennis and golf and bridge.

49:48.062 --> 49:52.639
As a matter of fact, you insisted.
Didn't you?

49:56.403 --> 49:59.474
What's gotten into you?
- What?

49:59.698 --> 50:03.433
Normally, if I spent so much time
with a man you'd be wildly jealous.

50:03.661 --> 50:06.067
Me?
- You always have been.

50:06.288 --> 50:08.944
I'm not the jealous type at all.

50:09.406 --> 50:13.187
Remember the Brinkhoff's party,
when Larry helped me on with my coat?

50:13.354 --> 50:17.303
Helped you on with your coat?
He was helping himself.

50:17.494 --> 50:21.909
You see, you were jealous.
- Of course I was jealous.

50:22.137 --> 50:26.798
And wouldn't you be furious
if I weren't? - Heck, yeah.

50:30.943 --> 50:35.381
Hey, I have to get my shower.
- Not yet.

50:46.370 --> 50:51.113
If I don't hurry we'll miss the dance.
- Wouldn't be the first one we missed.

50:51.333 --> 50:53.773
You shouldn't have invited Bert.

51:05.600 --> 51:12.966
Your loving husband,
the late George Kimball.

51:18.238 --> 51:20.477
In here, Arnold.

51:21.825 --> 51:27.363
I need help, I can't manage this.
- Later. I want you to hear something.

51:27.580 --> 51:30.318
What are you doing?
- Listen.

51:31.167 --> 51:33.609
One... two... three...

51:33.837 --> 51:37.038
What's this?
- Wait.

51:40.927 --> 51:43.203
"My dearest Judy,

51:43.847 --> 51:47.166
by the time you hear this tape,
I will be dead.

51:48.184 --> 51:52.049
Yes,
my hypochondria has finally paid off.

51:54.482 --> 52:00.768
Forgive the jest, but as you see,
I retain my sense of humor to the end.

52:03.658 --> 52:05.944
My darling, I want to tell you
how much I love you

52:08.580 --> 52:13.240
and how much happiness
you gave me during our marriage.

52:13.460 --> 52:17.076
When I found out that I was dying
I had great anxieties

52:17.297 --> 52:19.952
about you and your future welfare.

52:20.175 --> 52:23.541
It was for this reason
that I felt you should remarry,

52:23.762 --> 52:27.580
and that Bert
would make an ideal husband.

52:27.807 --> 52:31.174
I'm telling you all this
so you'll feel no guilt whatsoever

52:31.394 --> 52:33.338
about marrying Bert.

52:33.563 --> 52:40.097
After whatever is considered
a decent interval by your bridge club.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.975
And now, my dearest,

52:43.198 --> 52:45.686
I must close.

52:45.909 --> 52:50.058
With sincerest wishes
for your future happiness,

52:51.164 --> 52:53.689
your loving husband,

52:53.917 --> 52:58.031
the late George Kimball."

52:58.713 --> 53:00.372
Oh, it's beautiful,

53:00.799 --> 53:03.454
It's just beautiful.

53:09.349 --> 53:13.463
Hey, Arnold, would you take it easy?
You've been hitting the bottle hard.

53:13.686 --> 53:18.714
Yes, and I'll keep hitting it too.
I don't know how else to handle this.

53:18.942 --> 53:22.308
Quiet. Judy's upstairs.
- I'm sorry.

53:23.321 --> 53:27.934
George?
- What? - Do me. - Yeah. Come on.

53:30.286 --> 53:33.986
I want to tell you
how proud I am of you.

53:34.207 --> 53:40.576
The wonderful thing you're doing
for Judy. So unselfish and ennobled.

53:41.673 --> 53:46.084
I mean, actually fixing your wife up
with another man.

53:54.185 --> 53:59.213
Does it bother you
that Judy may marry this guy and,

53:59.441 --> 54:02.511
you know, the...
- You mean?

54:02.736 --> 54:06.020
Yeah.
- No, Arnold!

54:07.282 --> 54:10.187
She wouldn't think of it.

54:10.410 --> 54:13.943
All she needs now is a companion.

54:14.164 --> 54:20.449
Someone to walk with,
over the hill and down the other side.

54:20.670 --> 54:23.408
That's a beautiful thought.

54:23.631 --> 54:28.292
I'm going to miss you, bud.
- I know you will, buddy.

54:32.015 --> 54:35.880
You know something, old buddy?
The fact that the end is near

54:36.102 --> 54:41.723
seems to have sharpened my senses.
See this tree here, Arnold?

54:46.446 --> 54:48.888
Not too well, George.

54:49.366 --> 54:52.057
It's beautiful.

54:53.161 --> 54:55.961
Such strength.

54:57.582 --> 54:59.656
It's magnificent.

55:00.335 --> 55:02.611
And this table.

55:05.632 --> 55:09.165
It feels so good
just to run your hand over it.

55:09.886 --> 55:13.040
It's so smooth and cool.

55:14.974 --> 55:19.718
Well, all this is coming
a little late for me, this awareness.

55:20.563 --> 55:24.215
Why couldn't I have felt like this
every day of my life?

55:24.442 --> 55:27.845
But you still
have life ahead of you, Arnold.

55:30.782 --> 55:35.110
Arnold? Wake up! Feel alive,
appreciate the beauty around you.

55:35.328 --> 55:38.446
Don't you understand what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.

55:38.665 --> 55:42.945
Every chance I get,
I'm going to feel a table.

55:44.754 --> 55:46.354
Oh, boy,

55:47.382 --> 55:48.782
smooth.

56:10.989 --> 56:16.183
Do you know that
we haven't danced once? - I know.

56:16.646 --> 56:18.465
What's the matter?

56:18.747 --> 56:24.107
Aren't you feeling well? - I'm fine.
- Then why don't you ask me to dance?

56:24.335 --> 56:28.118
I mean, for me I feel fine. That's not
what you'd really call fine.

56:29.674 --> 56:33.706
Why don't you ask Bert to dance again?
- We've danced ... - He's marvellous!

56:33.928 --> 56:36.002
Oh really? Have you danced with him?

56:36.222 --> 56:37.222
No.

56:37.945 --> 56:42.731
He must be a marvellous dancer.
He does everything so well.

57:15.804 --> 57:19.776
Hi, are you with us? - Sure.
- Darling, do you know George Kimball?

57:19.933 --> 57:22.884
No.
- George, this is Linda Bullard.

57:24.700 --> 57:28.269
It's so nice to meet you.
I've met your wife at the supermarket.

57:28.496 --> 57:30.984
Yes, she mentioned it.

57:31.540 --> 57:35.868
Would you boys excuse me a minute?
I must phone the sitter at home.

57:36.086 --> 57:38.860
I won't be a minute, Darling.

57:49.391 --> 57:54.586
Why don't you ask me how
it's going? - Alright, how's it going?

57:54.814 --> 57:56.214
A-Okay.

57:56.899 --> 57:58.099
Green.

57:59.860 --> 58:02.682
If you here of any prospects,
let me know.

58:02.905 --> 58:07.316
Saturday dance night at the club
is always good for a split-up or two.

58:12.540 --> 58:17.817
You appreciate the life around you?
Do you, John?

58:18.212 --> 58:23.868
I mean, did you ever really look
at a tree? John!

58:24.093 --> 58:26.250
It's magnificent.

58:26.971 --> 58:29.413
Did you ever feel a table?

58:29.640 --> 58:33.707
Wake up! Live your life!

58:33.936 --> 58:39.925
Hi, George. I love you, George.
- She's such a sweet little woman.

58:40.151 --> 58:43.636
She's just like Judy.
- Who, George?

58:44.488 --> 58:49.646
She's falling into the trap
of that small-time lecher.

58:49.869 --> 58:51.895
What time, George?

58:52.913 --> 58:58.108
I should do something. - Do what?
- Just one good deed before I go.

58:58.335 --> 59:01.655
Go where, George?
- Strange, the way

59:01.881 --> 59:06.410
facing the great adventure
changes all your moral values.

59:06.635 --> 59:08.911
How, George?

59:09.138 --> 59:12.458
I'm going to do it.
- Do what, George?

59:12.761 --> 59:15.076
When, George?

59:19.807 --> 59:22.676
It's so smooth.

59:22.893 --> 59:26.379
I won't be home any later than 1:30.

59:26.606 --> 59:29.427
Alright. Fine. Bye-bye.

59:29.942 --> 59:33.476
May I talk to you for a moment,
please, in private?

59:34.155 --> 59:38.269
Of course, Mr. Kimball.
- Good. In here.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.696
Does this have a familiar ring?
- What?

59:48.920 --> 59:52.868
"Look, I know your next few weeks
are going to be tough.

59:53.090 --> 59:57.122
You're going to be lonely.
Say, how would it be

59:57.345 --> 01:00:03.665
if we had a nice quiet little drink
together some night?"

01:00:06.562 --> 01:00:09.253
Please go on, Mr. Kimball.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:22.192
Mr. Kimball, you just don't know
how grateful I am to you.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:27.902
You prevented me from making
a complete fool of myself.

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:33.069
How can I ever thank you?
- Oh, you don't have to thank me.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:37.115
I'll never forget you for this. Never.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:46.643
Judy!

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:52.088
May I help you, Mr. Kimball?
- No. Judy!

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:03.649
Judy, wait! Please, let me explain.
- That'll take some explaining.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:09.230
Kissing that woman in the checkroom!
- That was Linda Bullard. - What?

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.651
Yes. I was trying to tell her...

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:14.284
No wonder
the Bullards are splitting up!

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:17.113
Judy, this isn't our car.

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:21.747
Don't try to change the subject.
- Judy, wait.

01:01:21.971 --> 01:01:26.916
Probably by now the
whole town knows. Everybody but me.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.505
What on earth are you talking about?
- It all fits now.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:35.008
What fits now?

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:41.847
Shoving me off on Bert, so you
don't feel guilty with another woman.

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:45.061
What do you mean?
- Trying to send me to night school,

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:50.693
so you can have your evenings free.
- You're making a terrible mistake.

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:54.865
I'm leaving you, George Kimball!
I won't spend another night

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:58.906
under the same roof with a swinger.
- Swinger? - You're a playboy

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:02.784
and an adulterer!
- Judy, I have something to tell you.

01:02:03.012 --> 01:02:06.332
Give me those keys!
- Move over.

01:02:08.643 --> 01:02:13.339
Then say it. And please
take the lipstick off your face.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:19.764
I didn't want to tell you this,
but you have to know the truth.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:24.055
I won't have you thinking
I'm unfaithful to you. Especially now,

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:27.021
at the ebb-tide of my life.

01:02:27.245 --> 01:02:31.691
It's true,
I was trying to match you with Bert.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:38.237
But for a completely unselfish reason,
that I wanted you to have somebody.

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:41.120
Have somebody?
- After I'm gone.

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.502
So that's it.
You're going away with Linda Bullard,

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.333
that's what.
- I'm not going with anyone.

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:53.839
Remember yesterday, when I saw
Dr. Morrissey about my chest pain?

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.472
You mean your indigestion?

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:57.691
Yes.

01:02:58.109 --> 01:03:00.348
Well, I lied to you.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:01.569
Judy,

01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:05.013
my time is up.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:11.526
That's right, time for another pill.
- I'm serious. I'm dying. The ticker.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.575
George, if you don't stop...

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:17.918
It's true.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.746
Call Ralph, he'll tell you.

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:25.996
I may only have
a few more weeks to live.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:42.596
There, there. Chin up.

01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:47.850
Isn't it better
than having another woman?

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:04.489
It's enough, Arnold.
I'll park here for a while.

01:04:04.717 --> 01:04:11.002
Arnold, turn me around a bit.
I'd like to look at my tree.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:17.094
That's fine. - If you need anything,
I'll be mowing your back lawn.

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:21.890
I already mowed your front lawn.
- Oh, that is beautiful, Arnold.

01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:38.862
Hi, darling.
- Hi. - How are you feeling?

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:42.321
Well, perhaps
a little weaker than yesterday.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.988
I think sitting here is weakening me.

01:04:45.216 --> 01:04:48.785
But we put you in it to conserve
your strength. - I know, but...

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:52.995
And I've got the tickets.
Flight 17, leaving at 7:45 a.m.

01:04:53.224 --> 01:04:55.500
When we arrive in Rochester
there'll be

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:58.508
a limousine at the airport to take us
directly to the Mayo Clinic.

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:01.555
I think it's useless.
- Useless? George, nothing is useless!

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:04.387
It'll be so costly.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:09.556
I don't care. - It'll just prolong it.
I'll just lie there and linger.

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:13.351
One of the most expensive things
is to linger.

01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:19.614
I don't care about expense.
We'll spend every cent if we have to.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:21.774
Arnold!

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.284
Thank you, Arnold.

01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:37.628
Did you reach Dr. Morrissey?
- No.

01:05:37.852 --> 01:05:44.055
Not even his answering service.
- You've kidding! - No.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.802
Oh, Arnold.

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:51.348
And to think that
I accused him of being unfaithful,

01:05:51.574 --> 01:05:57.065
when his motives
were so unselfish, so noble.

01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:01.231
That's one heck of a guy
you got there, Judy.

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:06.451
When they made George Kimball
they threw away the mold.

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:14.076
Still no answer. I dialled right
through to Dr. Morrissey. - Me too.

01:06:14.305 --> 01:06:19.796
At a time like this he goes fishing!
Doesn't care for George at all.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:22.792
Just wait till I see him.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:31.643
Sit up, sweetheart.
It's good and hot.

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:35.765
Alright, now back. Okay?

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:40.147
Judy, you really surprise me.
- Do I?

01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:46.196
You've always been so dependent,
and you're taking this like a Trojan.

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.570
I never had to do it before.
You always took care of everything.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.709
Know something? If I had known
I would have told you right away.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.997
You should have. Promise you'll never
keep anything from me again.

01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:01.826
I won't.

01:07:12.488 --> 01:07:16.022
We certainly have had
wonderful times, haven't we?

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:18.842
So wonderful.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:22.896
Remember the little Chinese restaurant
just off Grant Avenue?

01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:29.196
Yes. Where we first met.
- Met? It was a pick-up.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.454
Was not.
- Was too.

01:07:32.675 --> 01:07:36.125
You were just sitting there alone
trying to decide what to order...

01:07:36.345 --> 01:07:40.080
And you walked over and said,
"Excuse me, I'm here with two friends,

01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:45.846
and we're entitled to wan-tan soup,
barbequed ribs and almond duck.

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:51.506
But if we have a fourth,
we also get chicken Canton..."

01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:53.336
You see?

01:07:55.615 --> 01:07:58.602
Yeah,
I guess it was a pick-up.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.751
Be right back, sweetheart.

01:08:33.361 --> 01:08:38.223
Hi. I saw your lights on, and thought
I'd see if you want some fish.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:40.642
No, thank you, Ralph.

01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:46.064
Please, Judy, you've got to take some.
I've got a carload out there.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.740
Oh, really, Ralph?
How nice for you.

01:08:49.961 --> 01:08:54.028
Isn't it wonderful that you can forget
everything and go off like that?

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:59.118
Yeah, it doesn't happen often.
Fortunately, I had nothing urgent.

01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:04.502
Nothing urgent? A patient
who may be dying isn't urgent?

01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:07.251
What?
- Look, all I can say is,

01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:12.554
I have never been so disillusioned
with anyone in my whole life.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:18.680
And you may as well know the truth:
I'm taking you off the case.

01:09:18.906 --> 01:09:22.724
You're taking me off what case?
- That's right.

01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:26.770
I guess I've been
out in the hot sun too long.

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:29.736
The fact that you
didn't want to tell me is one thing.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:33.279
But to go off and leave George
when he's...

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.872
dying.

01:09:36.549 --> 01:09:39.916
Oh, Ralph!
- Did I hear you right, Judy?

01:09:40.136 --> 01:09:43.752
Did you say George was dying?
- Oh, stop it, Ralph!

01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:50.127
I know all about it. I'm flying
him to the Mayo Clinic tomorrow.

01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:51.554
But...

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.187
Ralph Morrissey, how can you laugh
at a time like this?

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:07.443
I've encountered hypochondriacs
in my time, but never one like him!

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:12.243
Ralph,
you mean it isn't true?

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.993
He had a complete check-up
just two weeks ago. - I know.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:19.913
George Kimball will outlive us all,
unless he worries himself to death.

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:22.753
Then there's nothing wrong with him?
- Absolutely nothing.

01:10:22.929 --> 01:10:26.498
I told him that
in my office on Friday.

01:10:28.517 --> 01:10:32.846
Oh, how could he do this to me?
Why would he say he's dying?

01:10:33.064 --> 01:10:35.968
I don't know.
I'm not a psychiatrist.

01:10:36.192 --> 01:10:40.603
But, boy, they make a fortune!
- What possible reason could he have?

01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:45.564
Well, maybe... I don't know!
- Why did he say a thing like this?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.071
Oh. Of course...

01:10:56.295 --> 01:11:00.623
Of course!
- What? - I'll tell you why.

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:04.790
Because I suspected him of
having an affair with another woman.

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:09.673
And when I accused him he thought
he could cover it up with this lie.

01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:14.635
My advice to any wife in this
situation is, forget it. - Forget it?

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:17.911
Although, to the best of my knowledge
nobody's ever accepted that advice.

01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:20.424
And I won't be the first.
- That's what I thought.

01:11:20.653 --> 01:11:23.770
Would you like some fish?
They're awfully good for you!

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:26.099
No, I hate fish!

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:30.854
Then I guess I'll have to
eat the little fellas myself.

01:12:34.018 --> 01:12:38.844
Oh, my darling,
are you having another nightmare?

01:12:39.065 --> 01:12:43.476
No, honey, I...
- There, sweetheart.

01:12:43.694 --> 01:12:46.516
I think somebody hit me.

01:12:46.739 --> 01:12:50.723
It's alright, darling,
I'm here now.

01:12:50.952 --> 01:12:55.019
It's such a hot night,
I'll slip into something comfortable.

01:12:55.248 --> 01:12:56.448
Yes...

01:12:57.625 --> 01:13:00.114
I suddenly feel so warm.

01:13:01.379 --> 01:13:03.179
And damp.

01:13:03.798 --> 01:13:07.598
Oh, you poor angel!

01:13:08.678 --> 01:13:12.081
Isn't that the perfume
I gave you for our anniversary?

01:13:12.306 --> 01:13:13.549
Almost.

01:13:13.766 --> 01:13:18.628
The one I exchanged
for the one you gave me.

01:13:24.652 --> 01:13:27.425
It's such a hot night.

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:49.324
Remember our 5th anniversary?
- Remember? I made notes!

01:13:53.139 --> 01:13:55.296
We came home right after dinner.

01:13:56.767 --> 01:13:59.209
It was a night just like tonight.

01:13:59.437 --> 01:14:01.437
Full moon.

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:05.428
We had champagne on the patio.

01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:13.814
Isn't it a shame we can't
do the same tonight? - Why not?

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:19.987
Darling, your condition.
You don't have the strength.

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:23.408
Believe me, I'll find the strength.

01:14:24.795 --> 01:14:26.195
Well...

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:31.041
I think there's champagne
in the refrigerator. I'll get it.

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:33.369
I'll get it!

01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:36.239
Darling,

01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:39.257
didn't we have music?

01:14:39.477 --> 01:14:41.800
No, but I think I hummed a little.

01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:26.885
You're sweet,
I really don't need a wheelchair.

01:15:27.108 --> 01:15:30.225
Darling,
you need to conserve your strength.

01:15:34.615 --> 01:15:37.140
You're a sweetheart...

01:15:55.052 --> 01:15:57.541
Judy, let me in!

01:15:57.763 --> 01:16:00.086
Judy, What's going on?

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:29.160
Will you let me in?
- Stop that banging down there.

01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:31.370
What are you doing?

01:16:31.589 --> 01:16:33.698
You'll wake the... dead!

01:16:33.925 --> 01:16:35.619
But what's wrong?

01:16:35.843 --> 01:16:37.703
Ask Dr. Morrissey!

01:16:42.224 --> 01:16:45.591
What'd you do that for?
Will you let me in?

01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:50.217
I'll catch my death of a cold.

01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:53.049
Good. Be sure to give it to Linda!

01:17:13.798 --> 01:17:16.868
Oh, my cold pills.

01:17:37.697 --> 01:17:39.142
Hey, George.

01:17:41.576 --> 01:17:44.445
Thanks.
- Would you open up the door?

01:17:45.288 --> 01:17:48.109
You want to come in?
- Yes.

01:17:48.332 --> 01:17:50.359
I'll open the door.

01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:55.906
I love champagne.
How did you know I ran out of booze?

01:17:56.132 --> 01:17:59.535
How'd you get so wet? - Oh, shut up,
and get me some dry pyjamas.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.460
I just finished your eulogy.
Let me read it to you.

01:18:03.681 --> 01:18:05.841
I don't want to hear it.
- Yes, you do, listen:

01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:11.503
"They needed a good sport in heaven,

01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:16.178
so they sent for George Kimball. Yes,

01:18:16.944 --> 01:18:20.644
George Pommerton Kimball..."
- Arnold! - "the best..."

01:18:20.865 --> 01:18:23.223
I don't want to hear it.

01:18:23.576 --> 01:18:28.354
We're rather testy, aren't we?
- Yes, we certainly are.

01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:34.194
Well, I guess

01:18:35.046 --> 01:18:38.828
I'll have to
make a little change here.

01:18:39.884 --> 01:18:42.871
"Unfailing good humor."

01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:46.663
Sorry, George.

01:18:46.891 --> 01:18:51.135
Judy has thrown me out of the house.
- Judy, George?

01:18:51.979 --> 01:18:56.426
Thrown you out of the house, George?
Why, George?

01:18:59.195 --> 01:19:04.353
Is that the best you've got?
- Yes, till the laundry comes back.

01:19:04.575 --> 01:19:07.812
I know Judy.
She wouldn't do that without a reason.

01:19:08.037 --> 01:19:12.614
Well, she saw a woman
kissing me in the checkroom.

01:19:17.588 --> 01:19:22.165
"Faithful and devoted husband."
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:19:22.385 --> 01:19:25.289
It was all perfectly innocent...

01:19:26.138 --> 01:19:31.000
Well,
it's too long a story to go into now.

01:19:31.227 --> 01:19:32.589
I'm going to

01:19:33.271 --> 01:19:36.970
sleep in the kids' room, Okay? - It's
being painted while they're gone.

01:19:37.191 --> 01:19:41.341
You'll have to shack up with me.
- Oh, marvellous!

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:46.729
The least a man can ask
is to die in his own bed.

01:19:47.577 --> 01:19:53.019
Which side do you sleep on? - I sleep
here, Ruth sleeps by the window.

01:19:55.793 --> 01:19:57.156
So does Judy.

01:19:57.962 --> 01:20:01.578
What are you doing?
I like fresh air when I'm sleeping.

01:20:01.799 --> 01:20:06.044
I will not be poisoned
by damp night air.

01:20:08.389 --> 01:20:12.290
"Courtesy and consideration."

01:20:22.903 --> 01:20:27.647
Egad, you've got cold feet!
- Complaints, nothing but complaints!

01:20:27.867 --> 01:20:32.859
I could complain a little, too!
You ever cut your toenails?

01:20:39.253 --> 01:20:44.792
There she is,
probably sleeping peacefully.

01:20:45.426 --> 01:20:50.537
And she has the nerve to accuse me...
- I don't know, George.

01:20:50.765 --> 01:20:55.876
Methinks you complain too much.
- Don't play holier-than-thou!

01:20:56.103 --> 01:21:01.345
You weren't just making eyes
at that waitress in Miami.

01:21:02.193 --> 01:21:06.722
I have a good mind
to tell Ruth when she gets back.

01:21:09.242 --> 01:21:11.683
"Loyal friend."

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:16.189
Keep it up, buddy. You'll have
the shortest eulogy on record.

01:21:38.396 --> 01:21:39.396
Who?

01:21:40.898 --> 01:21:41.898
What?

01:21:43.109 --> 01:21:44.109
Yeah,

01:21:45.403 --> 01:21:49.814
Douglas 2-0-0-2-4.
- That's my number!

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:53.768
That's what he wanted.
- Who?

01:21:54.328 --> 01:21:57.446
Winnie. Winnie Burr.
- Winnie Burr?

01:21:57.665 --> 01:22:01.115
What'd you give it to him for?

01:22:25.693 --> 01:22:27.091
Hi, Winnie.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:31.517
I heard the horrible news.
Well, I'm just heartbroken.

01:22:35.912 --> 01:22:38.021
Who told you?

01:22:38.915 --> 01:22:40.822
The milkman?

01:22:44.253 --> 01:22:47.407
Yes, Winnie, I'm afraid it's true.

01:22:48.299 --> 01:22:52.497
No, no, I don't think there's
anything you can do to patch it up.

01:22:55.139 --> 01:22:58.922
Well, I guess
the next few weeks will be tough.

01:23:00.561 --> 01:23:01.959
Lonely?

01:23:04.065 --> 01:23:06.091
I imagine I will be.

01:23:08.611 --> 01:23:10.768
Quiet drink?

01:23:12.615 --> 01:23:14.215
Tonight?

01:23:16.786 --> 01:23:21.030
Look, Winnie,
will you call back later? The nerve!

01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:30.409
Oh, good morning, Mr. Kimball.
Excuse me for laughing, but

01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:34.249
you look great for a doomed man.
- How do you know ... - Dr. Morrissey.

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:38.086
Would you give this to Mr. Nash?
Thank you.

01:23:38.307 --> 01:23:40.963
I'm sure it'd look better on him.

01:23:44.772 --> 01:23:47.344
Milkman! Good morning.

01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:16.336
Of course I'm glad I'm going to live.

01:24:16.554 --> 01:24:19.423
But it's just one lousy way
of finding out.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.134
You doctors should have a way
to tell a patient nothing's wrong

01:24:24.353 --> 01:24:28.136
so he's sure there's nothing wrong!
Does Judy know?

01:24:28.983 --> 01:24:29.983
What?

01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:34.013
She thinks I'm covering up an affair.

01:24:34.238 --> 01:24:36.727
No, I don't want any fish!

01:24:38.117 --> 01:24:42.944
I took off so much, I'd better
put some back in. - Forget it.

01:24:43.164 --> 01:24:47.784
What's the matter, George?
- I'm going to live.

01:24:48.127 --> 01:24:51.411
That's the way to talk.
That's the old fighting...

01:24:51.631 --> 01:24:56.539
You don't understand. Dr. Morrissey
just told me I'm perfectly alright.

01:24:56.761 --> 01:24:58.669
There's not a thing wrong with me.

01:25:00.598 --> 01:25:05.626
You mean, you're not dying?
- That's right. - That's wonderful.

01:25:05.853 --> 01:25:08.722
Oh, thank heavens, George.

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.390
Was it a mistake in the X-rays?
They discover a new drug?

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:16.724
It was all a misunderstanding.
It was all my fault.

01:25:16.948 --> 01:25:20.647
But you told me the old ticker...
- I know, but I was wrong.

01:25:21.494 --> 01:25:23.318
And I'm sorry.

01:25:23.537 --> 01:25:28.137
You should be! Damn it!

01:25:28.584 --> 01:25:32.782
I've been drinking for 3 days on
account of you, I'm just recovering.

01:25:33.005 --> 01:25:36.823
On top of that I spent 2 days
and 2 nights writing your eulogy.

01:25:37.051 --> 01:25:39.824
And now you're not even dying!
- I'm sorry.

01:25:40.054 --> 01:25:45.130
Well, I feel like an idiot!
Crying, drinking, writing and mowing.

01:25:45.351 --> 01:25:49.798
Arnold, I said I'm sorry. - It's a
horrible thing to do to a friend!

01:25:50.022 --> 01:25:53.259
News flash:
She's packing to leave for Reno.

01:26:04.704 --> 01:26:07.739
Listen, he's got to go some time.

01:26:09.667 --> 01:26:16.404
"Your loving husband,
the late George Kimball."

01:26:18.634 --> 01:26:24.339
When was that dashed off? Right after
you concocted that wild dying bit?

01:26:24.557 --> 01:26:28.208
No, Judy, I...
- An affair is bad enough,

01:26:28.436 --> 01:26:33.713
but to cover it up with this lie!
To think he almost made a fool of me.

01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:37.593
I was taking him to the Mayo Clinic.
- You were a real brick, Judy.

01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:42.397
I'll tell my wife when she's a brick.
- Bert, what did he hope to gain?

01:26:42.617 --> 01:26:49.021
He knew he'd be found out eventually.
Couldn't he see I'd get suspicious?

01:26:49.248 --> 01:26:54.988
Judy, I told you, I took a pill...
- How could he get out of this?

01:26:55.212 --> 01:26:59.624
Sooner or later he'd give you
the old story of a mistake in X-rays

01:26:59.842 --> 01:27:05.997
or the discovery of a new drug.
- And I would've believed it too.

01:27:06.223 --> 01:27:09.923
But one thing went wrong,
didn't it George?

01:27:10.144 --> 01:27:15.718
The Doctor went fishing and couldn't
back up your "old ticker" story.

01:27:15.942 --> 01:27:19.593
And by accident, you saw
Dr. Morrissey first. - Exactly!

01:27:21.822 --> 01:27:25.226
Do you mind if I put some clothes on?

01:27:33.918 --> 01:27:36.787
Why can't you wear shoes,
like everybody else?

01:27:49.684 --> 01:27:53.632
Well, she's really leaving me.
- Tonight the window stays open.

01:27:54.272 --> 01:27:57.805
Arnold, you're a lawyer.
You've seen these things.

01:27:58.025 --> 01:28:01.392
How can a man convince his wife
that he's not having an affair?

01:28:01.612 --> 01:28:05.015
He can't. - But I'm not having one.
- Doesn't make any difference.

01:28:05.241 --> 01:28:10.399
Isn't a man innocent until proven
guilty? - Look, boy, it's your wife.

01:28:10.621 --> 01:28:15.614
You mean there's nothing I can do?
- There is one thing. - What?

01:28:15.835 --> 01:28:18.407
Confess. And ask her to forgive you.

01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:21.664
For what? - For the affair.
- When I'm not having one? - Right.

01:28:21.882 --> 01:28:25.368
Guys lie out of affairs, but
I'd be the first guy to lie into one.

01:28:25.595 --> 01:28:29.662
Face the facts. You know you're not
having an affair, she's sure you are.

01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:34.468
Why be stubborn? Admit it.
- Well, I don't know...

01:28:38.566 --> 01:28:42.716
Judy loves you. But she's a woman.
What woman doesn't want to see

01:28:42.945 --> 01:28:46.728
her husband crawl?
- Do you really think it would work?

01:28:46.949 --> 01:28:52.736
Yes! Women spend their lives trying
to get something on their husbands!

01:28:52.955 --> 01:28:57.616
Alright, Arnold, I'll take the advice.
I'll confess that I've had an affair,

01:28:57.835 --> 01:29:02.115
beg her forgiveness,
and that'll be that. - It's not easy.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.413
What more does she want?

01:29:04.634 --> 01:29:10.384
Plenty. They always want to know:
Who was she? How does she look?

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:14.789
How old is she? Do you love her?
Did any of Judy's friends

01:29:15.019 --> 01:29:17.508
see you together?
- They ask all that?

01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:24.182
Yes. And what is most important:
Was it worth it?

01:29:25.279 --> 01:29:28.599
Was it?
- No, no matter how great it was,

01:29:28.824 --> 01:29:31.397
you say it wasn't so good.

01:29:32.536 --> 01:29:34.444
I can't answer those questions.

01:29:34.705 --> 01:29:36.945
You've got to. If you hem and haw

01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:40.533
she'll think you have dozens,
and can't keep them straight.

01:29:40.753 --> 01:29:44.070
No, Sir,
you've got to snap out those answers.

01:29:44.257 --> 01:29:47.574
Just like that? - I'm telling you
what can happen when you cop a plea.

01:29:48.552 --> 01:29:52.371
I'm not copping a plea.
I'm an innocent man.

01:29:57.561 --> 01:30:00.431
Arnold, she's really leaving!

01:30:07.863 --> 01:30:11.183
I've got to stop her.
- Wait, bud. Let's take my car.

01:30:19.917 --> 01:30:22.276
Alright, Arnold.

01:30:45.693 --> 01:30:49.143
"Just confess. Confess everything.

01:30:49.363 --> 01:30:52.932
Lay it on good and thick.
She'll eat it up."

01:31:39.789 --> 01:31:44.366
Judy, don't do anything wrong!
- Let go! - Don't do anything rash!

01:31:44.585 --> 01:31:49.577
I lied to you
and I've decided to confess everything

01:31:49.799 --> 01:31:52.490
and beg for your forgiveness.

01:31:52.718 --> 01:31:56.334
Judy, please. - I was right.
You are having an affair.

01:31:56.555 --> 01:32:00.255
Yes, and I'm a rat.
- Oh, you are! - Judy, please.

01:32:00.476 --> 01:32:05.587
Let go of me. - Isn't it better
to discuss it like civilised people?

01:32:05.815 --> 01:32:08.470
Oh yes, it's better, dear.

01:32:08.693 --> 01:32:12.059
It happened to me, and I...
- Will you keep out of this?

01:32:18.744 --> 01:32:23.487
Alright, let's discuss it. - You ask
and I'll snap out the answers.

01:32:26.168 --> 01:32:29.286
Alright. Who is she?

01:32:30.089 --> 01:32:33.207
And it isn't Linda Bullard.
- It isn't Linda?

01:32:33.426 --> 01:32:39.130
No. I spoke to Linda, and she told me
all about Winston Burr.

01:32:39.348 --> 01:32:41.465
As a matter of fact, he called me too.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.305
But that's beside the point.
Who is she?

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:48.103
Her name is Dolores.

01:32:50.949 --> 01:32:52.311
Dolores who?

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.700
Dolores...

01:32:58.414 --> 01:32:59.657
Yellowstone.

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:03.318
Dolores Yellowstone?
- Yes.

01:33:04.462 --> 01:33:08.956
Where did you meet her?
- At a health food restaurant.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.377
Is she young?
- Yes.

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:19.792
What is she, a chorus girl,
a stripper or something?

01:33:20.019 --> 01:33:25.131
Certainly not! She's a
marine biologist at the aquarium.

01:33:25.775 --> 01:33:29.011
Did any of my friends see
you two together? - Of course not.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.976
And, by the way,
she wasn't worth the trouble.

01:33:33.533 --> 01:33:38.774
Oh, who asked you for that? - No one.
I just threw it in as a bonus.

01:33:38.997 --> 01:33:41.901
When will you see her again?
- Never. - Never?

01:33:42.125 --> 01:33:44.994
It's over, finished. We broke up.

01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:48.946
Do you expect me to believe that?
- Well, it's true.

01:33:49.174 --> 01:33:52.043
Don't you know
I can always tell when you're lying?

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.496
I'm telling the truth.
I'm never going to see her again.

01:33:55.722 --> 01:34:00.584
I repent. I loathe her.
- I don't believe you've broken up.

01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:05.471
It's true. I sent Dolores to New York,
to start a new life.

01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:09.473
What do you mean?
- Well, she didn't want to go.

01:34:09.694 --> 01:34:12.646
She was broke.
I insisted that she go.

01:34:12.864 --> 01:34:16.231
I gave her money,
and put her on that plane.

01:34:17.619 --> 01:34:21.733
Oh, really, George? - Yes.
- How much did you give her?

01:34:22.332 --> 01:34:26.150
Well, I don't remember exactly.

01:34:26.377 --> 01:34:28.653
Yes, I do. I'll prove it to you.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.119
Here it is, a check made out to cash.

01:34:31.341 --> 01:34:34.660
$1,000, and that's the end of Dolores.

01:34:36.095 --> 01:34:41.088
What? And you were nagging
about the price of ham!

01:34:41.392 --> 01:34:45.211
It was worth it to save our marriage.
- Well, it won't work,

01:34:45.438 --> 01:34:47.797
I'll tell you that right now.
- What do you mean?

01:34:48.024 --> 01:34:51.925
I was waiting to buy a ticket.
I was on my way to see a lawyer.

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:55.936
But then I started to think,
am I doing the right thing?

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:58.231
George has never lied before.

01:34:59.077 --> 01:35:03.524
Maybe I should believe him.
So I didn't buy a ticket.

01:35:03.748 --> 01:35:07.993
But now that you confessed,
George, it's all over.

01:35:08.545 --> 01:35:13.703
I can't live with you another minute.
There's just no love left.

01:35:13.925 --> 01:35:16.164
I feel nothing for you but...

01:35:17.595 --> 01:35:18.595
pity.

01:35:19.889 --> 01:35:20.889
Yes,

01:35:22.684 --> 01:35:25.291
I certainly am to be pitied.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.141
I don't suppose it would do any good
if I deny the whole thing over again?

01:35:31.985 --> 01:35:36.134
What? - If I tell you
I never had another woman,

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:40.858
and I just made it up hoping you'd
forgive me? - Please, don't do it!

01:35:41.077 --> 01:35:46.105
You'd just show your contempt
for me. I'm going home to pack.

01:35:46.332 --> 01:35:50.197
And don't you try to follow me!
Goodbye, George.

01:35:56.634 --> 01:36:01.792
Where are you, George?
There you are. Well, it worked, huh?

01:36:02.015 --> 01:36:06.544
I told you to confess and it worked.
It didn't work?

01:36:06.769 --> 01:36:10.385
Not even a bit? It failed totally?
You're going to hit me, right?

01:36:10.607 --> 01:36:15.599
No, you're not going to hit me.
But you'll hurt me. George, please!

01:36:24.329 --> 01:36:27.280
Excuse me, is Mr. Kimball in?
- No. - Are you Mrs. Kimball?

01:36:27.499 --> 01:36:32.989
Yes, but I'm very busy. - If you
don't mind, I'll handle this with you.

01:36:33.213 --> 01:36:37.825
This is the deed. Since he gave us
this check for $1,000 made out to cash

01:36:38.051 --> 01:36:40.706
I thought he should have this receipt.

01:36:42.138 --> 01:36:47.084
He gave you a $1,000 check?
- Yes, he did. - For what?

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.758
For your plot in Green Hills.
You must go up there with your hubby.

01:36:51.981 --> 01:36:55.431
It's lovely now. Everything's
in bloom. - Just a minute, please.

01:36:55.652 --> 01:37:00.561
My husband bought a cemetery plot?
- Yes. Didn't he tell you?

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200
No.

01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:09.610
Oh dog-gone it! I could tear my tongue
out! He wanted it to be a surprise.

01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:15.656
I hope this doesn't take the joy out.
- No, not at all.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.916
So, he did make up that confession.
There is no other woman.

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:26.465
No. But he
made arrangements for another man.

01:37:26.683 --> 01:37:31.094
Mr. Kimball was very thoughtful.
He made provisions for a 2nd husband.

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:36.641
It's a very unique idea. In fact,
we're using it in our advertising.

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:41.721
I hope Mr. Kimball won't be angry
because I let this slip out.

01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:48.529
Oh, I got it, Mr...? - Akins.
- Suppose we don't tell him?

01:37:48.746 --> 01:37:52.861
Just mail these to him, Okay?
He'll never know that I found out.

01:37:53.084 --> 01:37:57.946
Good! Then he can still surprise you.
- Yes. - You're a good egg! Thank you.

01:37:58.173 --> 01:38:03.034
Thank you, Mr. Akins. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:38:03.261 --> 01:38:06.581
Don't worry, I'll slip out the back.

01:38:07.599 --> 01:38:10.254
Don't be a stranger.

01:38:19.652 --> 01:38:23.471
Will you at least let me
drive you to the station?

01:38:24.699 --> 01:38:28.648
Suppose I told you
I changed my mind about leaving you?

01:38:29.078 --> 01:38:32.232
What about my affair with Dolores?

01:38:34.459 --> 01:38:39.535
I've decided to forgive you.
- You have? - Yes.

01:38:48.014 --> 01:38:50.539
Don't you move!

01:38:53.269 --> 01:38:55.343
Hi, Ju... George!

01:39:00.693 --> 01:39:02.767
Who was that?

01:39:05.657 --> 01:39:09.060
It was the florist. Sort of.

01:39:13.039 --> 01:39:15.991
Oh, George, what was that?
- A thorn.

01:39:16.209 --> 01:39:19.992
Have we got any iodine?
- No.
