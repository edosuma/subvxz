00:46.918 --> 00:49.002
Marina, Marina. Up.

00:54.248 --> 00:57.467
Wow! This looks so beautiful!

01:01.968 --> 01:05.488
Everybody, move around in your positions.
Marcus, come closer to Marina.

01:24.956 --> 01:29.556
That's good, guys. Stay right there.
Perfect. Eyes back. Stay with me in the eye.

01:46.087 --> 01:48.145
You know what is interesting?

01:48.175 --> 01:51.598
After 40 years of people
thinking you're insane

01:51.628 --> 01:54.186
and you should be put
in mental hospital,

01:54.216 --> 01:58.515
you finally actually get
all these acknowledgements.

01:59.585 --> 02:02.765
It takes such a long time
to take you seriously.

02:02.795 --> 02:07.481
There. Right there. Right there.
Don't move anything. Right there.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.703
It's a long way.

02:12.721 --> 02:15.971
Welcome to the Arts portion of our
program. Kind of the highbrow part.

02:16.001 --> 02:19.552
In fact, it's the Museum of Modern Art,
this exhibit we're talking about.

02:19.582 --> 02:22.627
But it might raise your eyebrows
is what this one might do

02:22.657 --> 02:23.971
in addition to being highbrow.

02:24.001 --> 02:26.498
You have to decide if it's highbrow or not.
Monica Morales went to see it.

02:26.528 --> 02:29.819
There are 3 pieces in particular
that are nude. Here's the first one.

02:29.849 --> 02:33.286
It's called "Imponderabilia"
by artist Marina Abramovic.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.574
- The name of the artist is Marina?
- Marina. Yeah.

02:36.604 --> 02:38.862
- Her last name.
- Don't know.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.294
- Abramovic. - OK, right.
- Like, you know, Eastern European.

02:42.324 --> 02:45.274
- You did tell me once, yes.
- Marina Abramovic.

03:44.606 --> 03:48.386
Ladies and Gentlemen, do not run.
Do not run. Thank you.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.370
I want whatever pass you have.

04:52.530 --> 04:56.341
My mother dressed me as a devil when I
was 4 years old for the little party

04:56.371 --> 05:00.364
My first party ever.
Everybody was dressed very happy.

05:00.394 --> 05:04.659
In the princesses and cowboys.
And I was looking so miserable

05:04.689 --> 05:06.822
just... really

05:06.852 --> 05:10.652
little kid with a very sad,
black devil dress with the two horns.

05:15.511 --> 05:19.761
I have no idea why she dressed me as
a devil. I think that marked my life.

05:20.705 --> 05:23.905
- So we are re-creating this image.
- Eyes back at me.

05:24.843 --> 05:27.734
Only 60 years later!

05:28.231 --> 05:32.559
I mean, after the show, I have to put
some more attention to sex in my life.

05:32.589 --> 05:34.499
So I have to really look for it.

05:34.529 --> 05:37.526
If I put advertising like that,
do you think that will...

05:37.556 --> 05:40.006
that will, uh, attract some, some guys?

05:43.242 --> 05:48.242
Semi-intellectual, artist on the top of
her career, looking for the single male.

05:50.513 --> 05:51.767
Ok.

05:54.658 --> 05:57.857
So basically you are
looking at many Marinas.

05:57.887 --> 06:01.865
You're looking the Marina who is
product of the two partisan parents

06:04.105 --> 06:08.657
two national heroes, no limits, will power.
Any aim she put in the front of her.

06:10.831 --> 06:14.756
And then, right next to this one,
you have the other one

06:14.786 --> 06:19.062
who is like a little girl, who, you know,
mother never give her enough love, and

06:19.092 --> 06:24.202
very vulnerable and unbelievably
disappointed and sad.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.060
And there is another one who have
this kind of spiritual wisdom

06:30.649 --> 06:33.682
and can go above all that.

06:35.803 --> 06:38.353
And this is actually my favorite one.

06:46.023 --> 06:48.925
Stop there. Come towards me a bit.

06:52.239 --> 06:53.839
This side on the line.

06:54.049 --> 06:55.920
He have to make from over...

06:55.950 --> 07:00.887
Oh, he's there. Hello?
We can... we can... Ok.

07:01.049 --> 07:03.585
Now we have to start.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.018
- I guess that was the...
- Yeah, yeah. Does look cooler.

07:07.048 --> 07:09.698
- OK. And then back to here.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.860
But here I have 10 pieces
already. Which is plenty.

07:15.181 --> 07:17.331
Yeah, but it's whether they work.

07:18.934 --> 07:23.084
I love your name, August. It's amazing.
Do you have a brother September?

07:24.302 --> 07:27.113
No, but who is writing the text?

07:27.914 --> 07:30.659
- That would be Klaus and his team.
- That be Klaus. - Yeah.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.961
- All right. So...
- I'll just be putting it on the wall.

07:32.991 --> 07:37.174
Oh, that's great to know. I like Times.
Just to tell you of the letter set.

07:37.204 --> 07:40.093
And I like Russian type
of letter setting.

07:40.123 --> 07:42.826
- But we can choice together some things.
- OK, great.

07:42.856 --> 07:44.852
- OK. That's great.
- Thank you. All right.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.841
It's too red, everything.

07:49.273 --> 07:52.973
Well, we talked about, uh,
making it black and white yesterday.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.810
Yeah, you know, there will
be color, actually. - OK.

07:56.352 --> 07:59.060
One time in my life I would
like to show everything.

07:59.090 --> 08:02.088
What it takes you to make
art and to be an artist.

08:02.185 --> 08:04.087
How much correspondence, how much e-mails,

08:04.117 --> 08:06.185
how much faxes, how much letters,

08:06.215 --> 08:08.613
how much plane tickets, how much...

08:08.643 --> 08:10.759
All this structure is just enormous.

08:10.789 --> 08:14.377
What is actually physical work which
has nothing to do with creativity

08:14.407 --> 08:16.396
but just administration.

08:18.115 --> 08:20.165
Marina Abramovic's office. Ehi.

08:21.403 --> 08:23.715
In MoMA, I have whole sixth floor. Wow.

08:23.745 --> 08:26.609
Which is big deal, I tell you.
It's big deal. - Unbelievable.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.973
I feel pain in my back
already just to think about.

08:30.003 --> 08:33.019
So it start chronological.
So this is the beginning, you know.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.239
It's the beginning,
my early work. You know...

08:35.269 --> 08:38.049
this work is, it's called
"Artist Is Present."

08:38.182 --> 08:42.730
So only is focusing on performance
where artist is literally present.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.853
Doesn't include my transitory objects,
doesn't include my sound pieces

08:45.883 --> 08:48.570
doesn't include my, uh,
objects, uh, with crystals.

08:48.910 --> 08:52.509
Just performance. Pure performance.
It's all about performance.

08:52.539 --> 08:56.036
If we have the video, we don't, we don't
show anything except video, you know.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.331
It's very radical.

08:57.361 --> 09:01.357
So for me, it's like that's why the show
in MoMA is historical for me, important,

09:01.387 --> 09:04.435
to really put the kind of
things in the right place.

09:04.465 --> 09:07.315
Because performance never
been regular form of art.

09:07.345 --> 09:09.327
It's been alternative since I was born.

09:09.357 --> 09:13.435
So I want to really to be real form
of art and respect. Before I die.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.841
Bye. And you. Kiss.

09:20.689 --> 09:22.634
So let's start with the exhibition.

09:22.664 --> 09:25.876
You are re-performing your own
performance? - No, new piece.

09:25.906 --> 09:28.221
- You're... you're making...
- I'm making new piece.

09:28.251 --> 09:31.538
- One new piece or several new pieces?
- Just one new piece. "Artist Is Present."

09:31.568 --> 09:33.996
And all the rest are
people re-performing my...

09:34.026 --> 09:35.926
my... 5 historical pieces.

09:37.029 --> 09:40.751
And so I think your first performance
was also in a museum

09:41.969 --> 09:42.828
in Belgrade.

09:42.858 --> 09:43.858
Is that...

09:44.350 --> 09:48.083
- No, you know, it's actually...
- No, but, but what kind of venues...

09:51.835 --> 09:55.987
And Marina, the element of sound is
imminent in "Relation in Movement"

09:57.427 --> 10:00.827
where you were driving a van
around a square for 16 hours

10:01.129 --> 10:03.192
and shouting numbers
through a megaphone.

10:03.222 --> 10:07.388
Yeah. - You substituted your persona
with that of a prostitute, yeah?

10:07.682 --> 10:10.851
And, "Rhythm 2" where you
took psychoactive drugs

10:10.955 --> 10:14.194
to challenge social attitudes
toward female mental illness.

10:14.224 --> 10:17.706
And "Rhythm 5, " where you lay
inside a wooden 5-pointed star

10:17.931 --> 10:21.220
set on fire and then fainted
from the lack of oxygen.

10:22.788 --> 10:27.580
Now these pieces, you have often been
threatened and threatened your own body,

10:27.719 --> 10:30.529
and I know you're probably
sick of these questions

10:30.559 --> 10:33.270
but I just want to touch on it
briefly before we can move on.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.958
There is only one question I
didn't hear since 10 years:

10:35.988 --> 10:37.202
Why is this art?

10:37.538 --> 10:40.463
This is, was the main question
since I start performances,

10:40.493 --> 10:44.321
people asking me, and I could not take it.
And now actually I'm missing it, like...

10:44.351 --> 10:47.633
nobody ask me, why is not art?
Because maybe it's my age so they,

10:47.663 --> 10:50.764
they kind of get it finally or
they just pretend to get it.

10:50.794 --> 10:55.687
If you're alternative when you're young,
when you're 18 and 19 and 20,

10:55.717 --> 10:59.717
and you're still alternative with 29
and you're alternative with the 30.

10:59.747 --> 11:02.965
And you're alternative with the 40.
And you're alternative with the 50.

11:02.995 --> 11:07.231
But excuse me, I am 63. I don't
want to be alternative anymore!

11:10.003 --> 11:14.711
Many people think of her as the
grandmother of performance art.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.510
Art must be beautiful.
Artist must be beautiful.

11:25.345 --> 11:29.645
Performance emerged in the sixties as
a result of a challenge to painting.

11:31.071 --> 11:34.571
Whatever it was, it was not
something you hung on the wall.

11:45.261 --> 11:47.962
It's a form of art where
the medium is the body.

11:50.182 --> 11:53.033
In the case of Marina,
she used the human body

11:54.087 --> 11:57.087
to make statements can
sometimes be quite violent.

11:58.847 --> 12:01.381
Can sometimes be provocative.

12:02.627 --> 12:04.698
She is directly and boldly...

12:05.789 --> 12:07.489
challenging an audience.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.059
What is at the heart of her artworks

12:14.537 --> 12:16.287
is the shared experience

12:17.483 --> 12:19.760
of the audience

12:19.790 --> 12:21.495
and the performer.

12:24.590 --> 12:27.190
Many of Marina's works
are interventions.

12:29.201 --> 12:32.429
When she did "Rhythm 0" in
Naples, with the objects

12:32.459 --> 12:35.209
and people could use the
objects against her.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.969
That is like the Stanford
Experiment, right?

12:37.999 --> 12:40.549
That is kind of a scientific
experiment

12:40.899 --> 12:42.699
that reveals human nature.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.557
But what is art other than
revealing human nature?

12:47.767 --> 12:51.484
It's like a murder mystery. It's like a
Hitchcock. Is she going to get murdered?

12:51.571 --> 12:52.921
There the gun is.

12:53.847 --> 12:57.316
What's going to happen?
Who's walking in? Who's walking out?

12:57.963 --> 13:00.819
The veneer of civilization is very thin.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.666
And what's absolutely terrifying
is how quickly a group of people

13:06.827 --> 13:10.227
will become bestial if you
give them permission to do so.

13:11.150 --> 13:15.619
And some of Marina's early
performances were about that.

13:16.269 --> 13:19.225
It's playing with that
edge of the knife...

13:19.870 --> 13:22.370
that allows her to
create the intensity...

13:24.390 --> 13:27.304
of the performances that
makes them transcendent.

14:04.865 --> 14:07.590
Basically, it's the workshop
called "Cleaning the House"

14:07.620 --> 14:10.069
and it's preparation
for the show in MoMA.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.574
Let's cut together. As fast as we can.

14:12.604 --> 14:15.604
Because we have to cut all this,
put in the soup

14:16.140 --> 14:17.240
before 2:00.

14:17.494 --> 14:19.597
My generation artist
not performing anymore.

14:19.627 --> 14:21.954
I'm one of the maybe
two or 3 still left.

14:22.158 --> 14:25.334
And I was thinking, I,
is my task to make history straight.

14:25.855 --> 14:30.105
So when I now asked to make a perspective
on the performance work in MoMA,

14:30.903 --> 14:34.544
I was really thinking that it would
be important for me to let it go

14:34.574 --> 14:35.999
also for my own ego

14:36.029 --> 14:39.660
and give 5 historical pieces to other
younger artists to be re-perform.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.404
So now they're coming and
I am cooking the soup.

15:20.581 --> 15:24.034
She said something like, we're not going
to eat or speak for 3 days. She's like:

15:24.064 --> 15:28.538
you'll hate me at the time but you'll love
me forever after and do whatever I want.

15:29.081 --> 15:31.616
What do you look so worry about?

15:31.646 --> 15:33.746
She wants us to fast for 3 days

15:34.540 --> 15:38.454
and she's mentioned some other
exercises that we'll be doing.

15:39.352 --> 15:41.737
Like, I'm going with my instincts on
this

15:41.767 --> 15:44.236
and it feels right to trust her.

15:44.757 --> 15:46.998
So you can make your last phone call.

15:47.028 --> 15:48.421
Last phone call.

15:48.845 --> 15:52.194
You know, you'll be free
for 3 days. It's amazing.

15:52.224 --> 15:55.121
- So what's, what's happening?
- We'll let you know later. Don't worry.

15:55.151 --> 15:58.613
- It doesn't matter.
- It's... it's just a little bit different.

15:58.643 --> 16:02.752
They can take this experience and can do
everything they want with their own life.

16:03.932 --> 16:06.434
But probably they will hate me anyway.

16:06.602 --> 16:08.093
At least in the beginning.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.011
Is very simple structure, you know,

16:10.300 --> 16:12.866
and the whole idea is to slow down,

16:13.109 --> 16:17.307
to slow down with your body and
your mind into zero gravity

16:17.427 --> 16:18.675
if it's possible.

16:18.705 --> 16:21.175
So, you know, the first
ritual will be to wake up

16:21.205 --> 16:24.397
and do some simple exercises
like, like a kind of,

16:24.427 --> 16:27.827
you know, little jumping and little
bit of the energy releasing.

16:27.857 --> 16:30.945
I will show it to you. It's very simple.
And then we go to the river.

16:30.975 --> 16:34.428
Anybody who have a problem with nudity,
please take a swimming suit...

16:34.458 --> 16:35.608
one bikini...

16:35.876 --> 16:39.253
one side, two sides, whatever you
want, or naked. I don't care.

16:39.489 --> 16:43.902
The purpose of this whole thing is that
they really have to perform 3 months,

16:43.932 --> 16:47.297
which is very big, um,
kind of obligation.

16:48.397 --> 16:51.397
So they have to create
their own charismatic space

16:51.856 --> 16:55.118
and for that you, you have
to consider some training.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.259
The proposition here is
just empty yourself.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.696
Be able to be in a present time.

17:07.868 --> 17:09.983
Put your mind here and now.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.241
And then something emotional open.

17:14.271 --> 17:17.539
And that's what we are
looking for in this work.

17:18.554 --> 17:21.935
In performance, you have to
have emotional approach.

17:23.558 --> 17:27.738
It's a kind of direct energy dialogue
with the public and the performer.

17:33.357 --> 17:37.507
And if you're performing in that way,
that you're there, at least 100 percent,

17:39.164 --> 17:42.214
there is emotional moment
arrive to everybody.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.466
There's no way out. Everybody feel it.

17:48.348 --> 17:51.155
Artist have to be warrior.

17:51.601 --> 17:55.751
Have to have this determination and
have to have the stamina to conquer,

17:56.841 --> 18:01.046
not just new territory but
also to conquer himself

18:03.120 --> 18:05.107
and his weaknesses.

18:06.871 --> 18:10.063
So doesn't matter what kind of
work you are doing as an artist,

18:10.093 --> 18:14.313
the most important is from which state
of mind you're doing what you're doing.

18:18.956 --> 18:21.976
And performance is all
about state of mind.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.300
So...

18:43.909 --> 18:44.726
wait and see.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.690
Marina Abramovic:
The Artist Is Present" means...

19:12.831 --> 19:14.231
that from March 9

19:15.376 --> 19:16.897
to May 31...

19:17.512 --> 19:20.234
whenever you enter the
museum during opening hours,

19:20.264 --> 19:24.103
it may be at 9:30 in the morning
or at 5:00 in the afternoon...

19:24.133 --> 19:25.633
she will be present.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.002
How I imagine "Artist
Is Present" in Atrium,

19:30.032 --> 19:32.945
I actually imagine more
like a kind of...

19:33.196 --> 19:34.255
film set.

19:36.437 --> 19:38.372
There is a huge square of light.

19:38.477 --> 19:42.471
And just that square, you know,
like "Lost in Translation" in some way.

19:42.702 --> 19:45.681
In the middle of that square is
placed a table and two chairs.

19:45.864 --> 19:47.907
It's so simple. It's like nothing there.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.541
It's just a artist sitting
like mountain, you know.

19:50.571 --> 19:53.342
I want to be just like a
rock there. Only 3 months.

19:53.802 --> 19:56.610
And looking you in the eyes.

19:57.662 --> 20:01.412
We are talking 3 months.
Every single day.

20:02.030 --> 20:04.265
If you are performing 3 months,

20:04.295 --> 20:06.709
it's really performance
become life itself.

20:10.938 --> 20:13.510
People don't understand that
the hardest thing is to...

20:13.540 --> 20:16.440
actually do something
which is close to nothing.

20:17.447 --> 20:20.865
It's demanding all of you because
there's no story anymore to tell,

20:20.895 --> 20:23.218
there's no objects to hide behind.

20:23.248 --> 20:25.618
There's nothing.
It's just your pure presence.

20:25.648 --> 20:28.974
You have to rely on your own
energy and nothing else.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.776
7 1/2 hours.

20:31.265 --> 20:32.967
6 days a week.

20:34.647 --> 20:35.697
Motionless.

20:37.631 --> 20:38.631
Wow!

20:39.612 --> 20:41.312
I have nothing to say.

20:42.213 --> 20:43.269
No comment.

20:43.791 --> 20:44.927
Only respect.

20:46.007 --> 20:49.007
I could imagine it being
unbearable to sit there.

20:50.177 --> 20:51.477
She's gonna try.

20:54.977 --> 20:57.477
I don't know whether it's going to work.

20:57.852 --> 20:59.152
Can I show you?

20:59.399 --> 21:03.406
When she had this idea, I said, "Oh,
God, she's going to kill herself."

21:03.638 --> 21:08.086
And I said, "Marina, I don't know if
I want to have "the responsibility

21:08.190 --> 21:11.230
of having "given you the
permission to do that.

21:13.254 --> 21:15.519
Think about it for two days."

21:15.691 --> 21:19.148
And then she called me the next morning,
she said, "I can do that."

21:20.551 --> 21:23.643
The moment that Klaus Biesenbach
came with the title of the show

21:23.673 --> 21:25.161
"Artist Is Present, "

21:25.191 --> 21:28.679
it was like a destiny. Click,
like right away. Artist Is Present.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.271
There's no anyway out.

21:30.375 --> 21:33.482
I wanted to show you.
I mean, isn't this fantastic?

21:33.795 --> 21:35.729
- It's the aesthetic...
- No one will ever see it except...

21:35.759 --> 21:39.477
And it's nothing to do with the museum,
not to get flooded for sure.

21:41.162 --> 21:44.342
I mean, maybe I don't use it
at all. I just have to...

21:44.372 --> 21:47.707
Oh, I'm very much counting on you
never using it. You promised.

21:47.737 --> 21:50.856
No, because, because is, it's like the
whole idea about, you know, security...

21:50.886 --> 21:52.810
Men don't get it. So I think it's fine.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.888
He doesn't want to hear...
to deal with reality.

21:55.918 --> 21:58.609
No, I think that's fine.
I think that's a brilliant solution.

21:58.855 --> 22:03.207
I have no idea why I have to do harder
and harder, it's like something in me.

22:03.312 --> 22:05.876
You know, I can perfectly
make retrospective,

22:05.906 --> 22:08.062
36 people re-performing my piece.

22:08.564 --> 22:10.616
We have wonderful dinner, celebration,

22:10.646 --> 22:12.757
go home and work is done.

22:12.861 --> 22:15.052
But why I have to do this?

22:15.082 --> 22:17.503
This is like my, my cross,
I am carrying it.

22:17.533 --> 22:21.905
It's insane. So,
God help me to finish this one.

22:28.124 --> 22:31.798
When you're watching a Marina
Abramovic performance,

22:31.902 --> 22:36.902
you are engaging with her physical
presence, which is very striking.

22:38.202 --> 22:42.402
The clear evidence that she has a lot
of physical stamina and strength,

22:42.992 --> 22:45.742
which the public and
its presence gives her,

22:48.173 --> 22:51.142
but clearly, physically,
it's innate. She can take...

22:51.906 --> 22:55.013
sitting still or doing very little or...

22:55.117 --> 22:58.267
whatever she's doing in the
performance for long periods of time.

22:58.297 --> 23:00.160
Which most people cannot.

23:05.341 --> 23:08.962
So, my both parents are national
heroes from the Tito time,

23:08.992 --> 23:12.567
you know, in the Second
World War in ex-Yugoslavia.

23:13.744 --> 23:15.848
I had a such a terrible...

23:15.969 --> 23:18.400
real control at home, which I hated.

23:18.653 --> 23:21.603
Everything was like, um,
disciplined, scheduled.

23:21.848 --> 23:24.225
I was trained to be soldier, literally.

23:24.255 --> 23:27.839
My mother would even wake me in the middle
of the night if my bed was not straight

23:27.869 --> 23:31.430
because I am sleeping too messy.
I mean, that kind of insanity.

23:31.574 --> 23:33.232
It was no love there, you know.

23:33.262 --> 23:37.129
I never remember my mother kissing me
or holding me in any possible way.

23:37.159 --> 23:40.233
And much later in my life when I ask her:
"But why, you know, you never kiss me?

23:40.263 --> 23:42.649
She was so surprised at
the question. She said:

23:42.679 --> 23:45.316
"Of course, I didn't kiss you,
not to spoil you."

23:45.346 --> 23:47.963
And she really didn't spoil me but...

23:48.067 --> 23:51.726
On other side, it was the grandmother
who was loving and always there

23:51.756 --> 23:54.825
and she was spiritual and spending
all the time in the church,

23:54.855 --> 23:57.843
and I was with her when I was a child
because most of them was doing...

23:57.873 --> 24:00.373
political career, never had time for me.

24:00.635 --> 24:03.590
So there's a kind of strange
mixture between spirituality

24:03.620 --> 24:05.873
and that Communist discipline.

24:06.030 --> 24:08.834
Looking now back,
it was very important to me

24:08.938 --> 24:12.779
and actually, this is what
make me what I am now.

24:21.478 --> 24:24.886
Nice to meet you.
You are welcome to Florence.

24:25.473 --> 24:28.961
I went to this,
bathroom in aeroport,

24:29.419 --> 24:31.820
and there was a fantastic discovery.

24:31.925 --> 24:35.490
Two pages with illustrations:

24:35.594 --> 24:39.368
"How to wash the hands
by water and soap."

24:39.582 --> 24:43.604
It's, "Come lavare i mani
con acqua e sapone."

24:44.756 --> 24:45.756
Brilliant.

24:48.745 --> 24:51.045
Today we are here for the important

24:52.625 --> 24:54.463
Lorenzo Magnifico award

24:54.868 --> 24:56.895
to Marina Abramovic.

24:56.925 --> 24:58.975
Thank you. Thank you very much.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.840
So I need the microphone. All right.

25:04.339 --> 25:07.730
And now, you know, I was thinking
last I would give a lecture.

25:07.834 --> 25:11.205
And I don't feel in this occasion
getting prize to give a lecture.

25:11.235 --> 25:14.802
I would like to actually have a
more dialogue with the public.

25:14.832 --> 25:18.332
And before I do this, I would
like to read you my manifest.

25:21.586 --> 25:24.986
So, my manifest, I think I
wrote really out of my heart

25:26.947 --> 25:29.797
and is also is actually
funny in the same time.

25:31.284 --> 25:32.384
But is true.

25:32.936 --> 25:35.936
An artist should not lie
to himself or to others.

25:42.788 --> 25:46.326
An artist should not steal
ideas from the other artist.

25:46.594 --> 25:51.044
An artist should not compromise for
themselves or in regard to the art market.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.290
An artist should not kill
another human being.

26:02.665 --> 26:05.997
An artist should not make
themselves into an idol.

26:06.202 --> 26:09.370
An artist relation to his love life...

26:14.117 --> 26:15.889
No, love life, love... amore.

26:20.327 --> 26:22.007
I apologize...

26:26.222 --> 26:29.955
An artist should avoid falling
in love with another artist.

26:30.451 --> 26:34.346
An artist should fall, avoid to
falling in love with another artist.

26:34.376 --> 26:38.326
An artist should fall, avoid to
falling in love with another artist.

26:47.703 --> 26:51.253
The very first moment we met
was when she came to Amsterdam.

26:53.370 --> 26:56.201
She was to do a performance.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.576
I met her just before that one.

27:00.437 --> 27:02.777
The performance was
called "Thomas Lips."

27:02.881 --> 27:06.561
It came down to that she would
cut a pentagram in her stomach

27:06.665 --> 27:09.924
with a razor blade and
she would whip herself.

27:11.285 --> 27:14.469
And I said, "No, no, maybe not."

27:14.614 --> 27:17.064
Afterwards, I start nursing her wounds.

27:18.832 --> 27:21.932
I didn't lick her wounds
but I cared for the wounds

27:22.326 --> 27:25.364
and cleaned it and, you know,
put something on it.

27:25.766 --> 27:28.216
And I think that was the crucial point.

27:30.679 --> 27:34.169
At the time we met, there was
immediately a fascination.

27:34.415 --> 27:37.316
Type-wise, character-wise,
personality-wise,

27:37.346 --> 27:40.745
the work we had been doing
singularly, she and me.

27:42.292 --> 27:45.804
You know, there was a recognition like you
have found a lost brother or a lost sister

27:45.834 --> 27:47.284
or something like this.

27:47.314 --> 27:50.398
Plus, that we were born on the
same day, November the 30th,

27:50.428 --> 27:52.228
both Sagittarius. Obvious.

27:53.426 --> 27:55.670
You know, destiny brought us together.

27:57.759 --> 28:01.309
I really loved him, I mean,
loved him like more than myself.

28:03.201 --> 28:06.263
And for me, was when we start
working together, this was forever.

28:06.293 --> 28:10.022
I was thinking, this is the relation,
this is work and it will never stop.

28:10.218 --> 28:15.052
It was like two twins connected with the,
with the body together, and soul.

28:16.711 --> 28:18.761
We were lovers, we were friends

28:20.038 --> 28:21.438
we were performers

28:22.222 --> 28:23.677
all at once.

28:24.028 --> 28:26.267
And our love was always on top of it.

28:29.017 --> 28:33.167
I think Marina and Ulay's relationship
is one of the great love stories.

28:33.959 --> 28:37.659
Marina is very hardcore and she
had met someone who was equally

28:37.784 --> 28:40.434
prepared to go to any
lengths for his art.

28:41.294 --> 28:45.245
And that must have impressed her
enormously because she had met her equal.

28:49.016 --> 28:51.588
When Marina and Ulay came
together and started

28:51.618 --> 28:54.205
the group of works known
as the Relation Works,

28:54.294 --> 28:57.494
there had been nothing like
it in performance before.

28:58.862 --> 29:03.200
We would engage our bodies
in a confrontational way

29:03.304 --> 29:06.745
we wanted to get to the point
about male/female conflicts,

29:07.304 --> 29:09.890
traumatic experiences about relation.

29:10.192 --> 29:14.160
Afterwards, often we were black
and blue.  

29:14.190 --> 29:14.994
 But it didn't hurt.

29:35.777 --> 29:39.471
Our 12 years that was as
intensive and as heavy

29:39.625 --> 29:42.675
as powerful as other people's
whole life, I guess.

29:45.722 --> 29:50.202
We went through so many stages: falling in
love, having this relation of 12 years.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.795
Now we are talking 23 full years

29:52.942 --> 29:56.442
that we are able first time
ever to be under the same roof.

29:59.985 --> 30:01.806
Ulay should be here at 2:00.

30:01.962 --> 30:06.113
The first time that Ulay comes in in
this specific apartment in New York

30:08.090 --> 30:11.486
Never here, never Upstate.
They've been separate since many years

30:11.516 --> 30:14.266
so we are getting together
to talk about it.

30:16.020 --> 30:19.784
And I have no idea what will come
out but be for sure interesting.

30:20.417 --> 30:21.417
For sure.

30:24.837 --> 30:25.837
Hello.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.470
- How you doing?
- Doing fine.

30:31.650 --> 30:34.214
I've just been with psychoanalyst.

30:34.244 --> 30:36.650
Dr. Glimour. Very special lady.

30:37.389 --> 30:39.380
Really strict. I like strict. 

30:39.410 --> 30:41.894
  I mean,
she doesn't have uniform, but almost.

30:42.324 --> 30:45.782
So she told me emotionally,
I am not doing so bad.

30:46.030 --> 30:48.890
I should go more into my childhood,

30:49.621 --> 30:53.272
look into the patterns not to
repeat for the next relationship.

30:53.794 --> 30:57.672
I told her about Ulay and she think
maybe it's going to be easy...

30:58.384 --> 30:58.978
maybe not

30:59.095 --> 31:01.467
the whole thing.
You know, we don't know.

31:01.497 --> 31:03.647
OK, let me have a glass of water.

31:05.888 --> 31:09.283
We both are in third act of our life.

31:11.051 --> 31:13.692
There's no other moment,
you know, to get closer

31:13.722 --> 31:15.533
and somehow forgive each other.

31:15.563 --> 31:19.414
To really kind of peacefully, find OK,

31:19.722 --> 31:22.572
it was really horrible
and painful and hateful

31:22.716 --> 31:26.101
and everything else together.
But it was creative at the same time

31:26.131 --> 31:28.554
and we should just forgive each other.

31:30.458 --> 31:31.836
Are you in the wrong building?

31:31.866 --> 31:34.403
- No, it's the...
- The Performing Garage is right here.

31:34.433 --> 31:36.001
- No, this is my building.
- Hi, dear. - How are you?

31:36.031 --> 31:39.277
What shall I call you?
"The Grandmother of Performance Art?"

31:39.307 --> 31:42.179
- Or "the Diva of Performance Art?"
- No, come in, come in.

31:42.209 --> 31:43.959
I think I still love her.

31:44.408 --> 31:48.047
 I can live with it. I'm happy
I do, rather than hating her.

31:48.348 --> 31:49.574
So this my loft.

31:50.568 --> 31:54.170
- This is Davide. Davide you know?
- No shit. - My assistant. - Hi, Davide.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.739
You met before, no?

31:55.769 --> 31:58.629
- Yeah, I think up in the
office, isn't it? - Yes.

31:58.659 --> 32:01.553
And you were the one who
sends the e-mails? - I do.

32:01.583 --> 32:04.863
Davide is young artist.
And good one, too. From Torino.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.950
- David-ay. - Yeah, not David.
- Davide. - Davide.

32:08.235 --> 32:11.381
- So, how you doing?
- I am doing fine. Look at me.

32:11.574 --> 32:12.441
Totally.

32:12.471 --> 32:14.471
If I can be of help, pleasure.

32:16.074 --> 32:19.524
If I can do something for her,
pleasure. Depends what, but

32:20.201 --> 32:22.651
you know, speaking now, yes, of course.

32:23.296 --> 32:26.249
I can do only two things.
Help, or be good.

32:26.457 --> 32:29.965
It's an amazing place, Davide.
Are you often here, Davide?

32:30.070 --> 32:31.784
Yes, pretty pretty often here, yes.

32:31.814 --> 32:35.262
Yeah, I would, I would try to do
the same, ya. It's a great place.

32:35.292 --> 32:37.628
Maybe she still loves me. I don't know.

32:38.446 --> 32:41.869
We will figure out tomorrow something.
Tomorrow after tomorrow.

32:41.981 --> 32:43.164
And maybe...

32:43.827 --> 32:46.149
put a finger on her teeth.

32:47.086 --> 32:48.196
Put a finger on her teeth?

32:48.226 --> 32:51.276
Yeah, that means to make
something sensitive. Yeah.

33:02.044 --> 33:05.505
Marina, are you nervous about the show
at the MoMA? Or are you not nervous?

33:05.535 --> 33:07.893
Incredibly. I'm always nervous
even if I give a speech.

33:07.923 --> 33:10.335
- I sit in the toilet for days.
- Good.

33:10.710 --> 33:14.509
If I'm not nervous, then I'm
nervous why I'm not nervous.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.022
And when you are sitting in the chair

33:18.052 --> 33:20.073
are you going to move on
the chair a little bit,

33:20.103 --> 33:22.650
leaning backwards and forwards, or you...

33:23.364 --> 33:25.508
planning on staying
in the exact same position?

33:25.538 --> 33:27.362
Exact same position. Not moving at all.

33:27.392 --> 33:29.800
Just looking straight.
What are you looking at right there?

33:29.830 --> 33:31.451
Anybody who sit in front of me.

33:31.481 --> 33:33.382
Oh, there's another
chair in front of you.

33:33.412 --> 33:36.307
Yeah, because anybody from audience
can sit as long as they want.

33:36.337 --> 33:37.518
In front of you.

33:37.548 --> 33:40.598
And it's between 11,000 and
15,000 people at MoMA, so...

33:41.067 --> 33:43.557
it's just The Gaze.

33:48.119 --> 33:52.191
Marina seduces everybody she ever meets.

33:52.684 --> 33:55.458
But that's not the case for me
because I went through that process

33:55.488 --> 33:57.188
and now we are divorced.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.372
We are great friends,
but we are divorced.

33:59.402 --> 34:02.826
So she would never try to seduce me,
because we are divorced.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.187
With Marina, I always try
to subtract the performer

34:12.478 --> 34:15.239
from the person I have a
working relationship with.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.951
And I try to deal with her
as if she was a sculpture.

34:17.981 --> 34:20.652
I look at her work as
if it was an object.

34:21.981 --> 34:24.804
I try to be incredibly
matter-of-fact with her

34:24.835 --> 34:29.835
because I don't want her "performance
persona" to get into the way.

34:32.242 --> 34:35.418
Because with Marina,
she's never not performing.

34:43.212 --> 34:45.112
Marina, you don't need this?

34:46.362 --> 34:47.599
You sure?

34:50.168 --> 34:51.301
He makes the wine disappear.

34:51.331 --> 34:54.918
I can teach you one that
you can also do that's fun.

35:05.514 --> 35:08.880
I just meet recently somebody
that so many people told me

35:08.910 --> 35:12.697
I should meet, I should meet,
and that just happened in MoMA, and

35:12.727 --> 35:15.961
so we came here and had,
uh, a little drink.

35:16.065 --> 35:18.752
And it's this quite interesting, you know,
guy. 

35:18.782 --> 35:21.050
 He's a magician, David Blaine.

35:26.043 --> 35:28.174
He was thinking we can
maybe do something,

35:28.204 --> 35:31.799
during that my... my,
... performance in MoMA.

35:32.165 --> 35:36.546
You know there's always those axes in the
glass in case of emergency, you know.

35:36.793 --> 35:40.243
So, I was thinking if somehow
I got into using this alco...

35:40.338 --> 35:43.674
this substance that she has,
and gagging her face with it,

35:43.704 --> 35:46.038
and people would think
it was pretty strange.

35:46.068 --> 35:49.206
And then breaking the glass
open and then taking an axe

35:49.236 --> 35:50.603
and just gutting her.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.508
And then come emergency,
they put a blanket over me,

35:53.576 --> 35:57.849
blood all over the place. And you know,
the police come, take him to prison.

35:57.879 --> 36:01.991
She's laying there and the exhi...
the whole exhibition is over.

36:02.354 --> 36:05.413
And people, they don't know what
happened...was accident, not accident?

36:05.443 --> 36:08.427
Questioning, you know,
maybe reality is not reality.

36:08.457 --> 36:12.684
- And I'll just hack her violently.
- You've done this before?

36:13.177 --> 36:14.177
No.

36:16.281 --> 36:18.317
If I do it twice, it's an illusion.

36:18.347 --> 36:21.947
But when you do it one time,
it's... it's crazy.

36:22.051 --> 36:26.151
I mean, the amazing thing is, Marina,
that it's going to be in at MoMA.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.976
Those people are the perfect
people to do it to. - Absolutely

36:31.006 --> 36:32.159
Yeah. You know.

36:33.320 --> 36:37.500
- What do you really think?
- I think it's a really bad idea.

36:37.965 --> 36:38.899
Why?

36:38.929 --> 36:42.845
Because he's a really interesting
guy and he does amazing things.

36:43.357 --> 36:45.750
But the fact of the matter is, you know

36:45.780 --> 36:48.547
some people culturally call
people like that magicians

36:48.577 --> 36:51.643
but I am sure he would prefer
to be called an illusionist.

36:51.904 --> 36:54.333
And that really tells you
all you need to know.

36:54.363 --> 36:58.028
Your work doesn't have anything to
do with illusionism. It's all real.

36:58.386 --> 37:01.870
And to make the connection between
those two bodies of work in MoMA

37:01.900 --> 37:03.818
on the occasion of the
most important show

37:03.848 --> 37:07.003
you've made to date in your
career would be a disaster.

37:07.033 --> 37:09.873
I think it's completely the wrong
thing to do. Totally wrong.

37:09.903 --> 37:12.590
I would oppose it with
every fiber of my being.

37:12.620 --> 37:15.170
- How about that?
- Done! You're right.

37:15.512 --> 37:18.240
- I accept.
- Done. - Ok, thanks.

37:18.270 --> 37:22.501
We've worked with 9 galleries now.
And now Marina is such a giant.

37:23.005 --> 37:26.390
But Sean is the one that came
when no one wanted to deal with...

37:26.568 --> 37:31.021
all the blurry problem... problems
of having a performer artist in a...

37:31.644 --> 37:34.452
in a gallery context.

37:34.684 --> 37:36.478
Let me ask you a question.

37:36.704 --> 37:39.118
If you, if you do blue or, or... or red

37:40.669 --> 37:43.319
which you would choose?

37:43.349 --> 37:45.999
- Like, like first feeling you had.
- Red.

37:47.519 --> 37:50.691
Klaus just choose blue but,
but everybody want red.

37:51.212 --> 37:54.283
Obviously, performance is by
its very nature ephemeral.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.915
So, what we did was that
we very carefully selected

37:56.945 --> 37:59.356
one photograph to
represent each performance

37:59.386 --> 38:02.757
and then we made those into
editions and we sold them.

38:03.288 --> 38:04.417
That looks amazing.

38:04.447 --> 38:07.446
And we did them in very small editions.

38:07.871 --> 38:10.676
You have to remember this
is 20-odd years ago, so...

38:11.073 --> 38:14.523
we were selling them for between
$ 2,000 and $ 5,000 each.

38:15.781 --> 38:19.786
And now, you know, they're, they're very
sought after and if you could find them

38:19.816 --> 38:22.676
they would be between $
25,000 and $ 50,000 each.

38:22.706 --> 38:24.293
There's a certain drama to those pieces.

38:24.323 --> 38:26.587
The model that we created for Marina

38:26.617 --> 38:29.331
and the way that we
created the market for her

38:29.361 --> 38:31.970
has become something of a standard

38:32.374 --> 38:34.524
that other people have looked at.

38:34.554 --> 38:35.750
So there's that.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.681
In the 70s with Ulay

38:50.711 --> 38:54.008
we took this such a radical
decision to just live in the car.

38:54.306 --> 38:58.221
We don't need to pay telephone bills,
electricity bills, rent bills.

38:58.579 --> 39:00.300
And we didn't have no money at all.

39:00.330 --> 39:03.364
But we didn't want to do
anything else but performing.

39:03.394 --> 39:06.627
Igor, this is the van where I live.

39:07.466 --> 39:10.458
I live all this time and,

39:10.954 --> 39:14.581
two days ago, you said: "How cute!" And
I said: "Cute is when it's in a museum

39:14.611 --> 39:17.607
but it was tough life.
It was not cute at all."

39:18.074 --> 39:19.444
So, let's go inside.

39:20.427 --> 39:22.961
I didn't see this car
for more than 30 years.

39:23.066 --> 39:24.928
And when arrive in the museum,

39:24.958 --> 39:27.807
it hits me completely
unexpected like in my stomach.

39:28.330 --> 39:32.480
It was something that, that like an
entire past life just rushing to me.

39:34.433 --> 39:36.010
We have to go in the countryside.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.940
We have to live with
shepherds, milk the goats.

39:39.218 --> 39:41.909
We have to go with the empty
bottle with mineral water

39:42.033 --> 39:44.777
and borrow gasoline on the stations.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.660
I knew every shower in every
gasoline station in Europe.

39:48.827 --> 39:51.577
Anyway, I am very
sentimental about this van.

39:53.331 --> 39:55.695
Oh, God. It really breaks my heart.

39:55.725 --> 39:57.631
Looking at this car inside. And how...

39:58.033 --> 39:59.252
really...

39:59.282 --> 40:03.033
how much belief and
hope and innocence our life,

40:03.136 --> 40:05.192
you know, was dealing with in that time.

40:05.222 --> 40:07.822
This is incredible happy time
of my life...

40:08.556 --> 40:09.412
in this place.

40:10.098 --> 40:13.438
It was everything I always wanted.
The man I loved, and...

40:13.468 --> 40:16.177
and work together and be radical and

40:16.483 --> 40:18.834
not making any compromise whatsoever.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.322
And Two of us, and the
dog and...

40:23.517 --> 40:24.667
and Universe.

40:25.511 --> 40:27.411
Show me that incredible road

40:28.140 --> 40:30.072
from living there to here.

40:30.967 --> 40:32.399
It's been long way.

40:36.185 --> 40:38.685
I have to go and put the show
together.

40:39.581 --> 40:41.185
 I have no time.

40:43.153 --> 40:46.053
Marina was knitting sweaters
for the both of us.

40:46.405 --> 40:50.805
I was repairing the car. I drove the car
all the time. Marina couldn't drive.

40:52.409 --> 40:56.929
So it was really basic, basic,
basic, basic. Like modern nomads.

40:57.672 --> 40:59.423
But it was the best time.

40:59.803 --> 41:03.562
And from that, we got a lot
of energy, a lot of power.

41:08.475 --> 41:11.525
- So this is Hudson River?
- This is Hudson, yeah.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.350
Straight ahead. Red light stop.

41:18.575 --> 41:20.716
Green light go.

41:20.956 --> 41:24.153
Let's stop right here somewhere
because I would like to drive now.

41:24.183 --> 41:28.383
It's my historical moment. I'm going
to drive you. First time in my life.

41:28.596 --> 41:30.596
I'm willing to sit beside you.

41:36.629 --> 41:37.629
Wow, Ulay.

41:39.616 --> 41:42.519
We would never think it
would come to this point.

41:42.549 --> 41:43.455
  Ever.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.980
- Do we have light?
- To the right.

41:49.091 --> 41:51.338
- No, do we have light?
- Yeah, the light is on.

41:51.368 --> 41:53.898
- Oh, that is great.
- I put the light on already.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.428
Is the brake down? Oh, brake is up.

41:56.458 --> 42:00.104
- Brake is up. Now it is down.
- Thank you. I knew something was wrong.

42:03.992 --> 42:05.894
Let's go. Let's ride.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.775
You're going to be my hands now.

42:09.271 --> 42:13.169
Yeah, I was afraid so.
Turn to the right a little more.

42:13.564 --> 42:17.264
Little more. Stop, stop.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go, go, go.

42:17.294 --> 42:19.408
It's perfect. Perfect. Just perfect.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.297
Go further.

42:23.198 --> 42:26.220
One meter you can go,
or we have to go through this door.

42:27.226 --> 42:31.316
Well, well, I'm a little
shaky but I'm, you know,

42:31.550 --> 42:33.345
shaken but very much taken.

42:34.104 --> 42:35.604
OK, from 1-10, Ulay,

42:36.880 --> 42:38.887
- what do you think? 5?

42:38.917 --> 42:39.704
More.

42:39.734 --> 42:40.550
- 6?

42:40.580 --> 42:41.356
- More.

42:42.212 --> 42:44.812
- OK, we go for 7 1/2.
- No, we go for 7.

42:45.083 --> 42:48.130
Yeah, we go for 7. 7 is a good number.

42:48.790 --> 42:49.459
Great.

42:57.850 --> 42:59.913
- Well done.
- Well done. - Abramovic.

42:59.943 --> 43:00.993
Abramovic.

43:01.110 --> 43:03.110
Yeah, you, you work like hell.

43:03.243 --> 43:05.904
- That's the only thing I know.
- That's true.

43:05.934 --> 43:08.934
I'm going to make zucchini
sauce, with this pasta.

43:09.794 --> 43:13.444
Our relation was very much to
do with the really male/female

43:13.895 --> 43:16.166
kind of separation of the duties.

43:16.196 --> 43:18.125
He would do everything
with this external world

43:18.155 --> 43:21.438
you know, getting grants,
finding the money, going to the bank.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.753
And I would do cleaning, washing,
and taking care of the dog.

43:24.862 --> 43:27.799
And I remember when we split,
I didn't have a bank account.

43:27.829 --> 43:30.029
I had no idea how that all worked.

43:30.577 --> 43:33.666
Took me a long time to learn
everything from the zero.

43:34.459 --> 43:36.642
- And you have opener?
- Yes.

43:37.193 --> 43:40.133
After our more simplistic life

43:40.589 --> 43:42.054
she became very ambitious.

43:42.084 --> 43:45.462
Both in the work and in the
manifestation of her ambition.

43:45.617 --> 43:49.071
Meaning image and wealth.

43:51.259 --> 43:54.209
And I maybe went in a more
stable, straight line

43:54.385 --> 43:55.735
after separation.

43:55.895 --> 43:59.106
And she climbed a huge mountain

43:59.893 --> 44:01.606
with a lot of success.

44:02.433 --> 44:05.614
Maybe it sounds strange, but I don't
have the time to do this effort

44:05.770 --> 44:06.797
to make this...

44:07.927 --> 44:08.993
possible...

44:09.153 --> 44:10.203
for myself.

44:11.110 --> 44:13.693
But anyhow, I don't have to
make it possible for myself,

44:13.723 --> 44:15.887
I'm just going to marry her.

44:16.727 --> 44:19.077
Is this OK if I make a little bit...

44:20.906 --> 44:22.709
- spicy?
- Yes.

44:22.843 --> 44:24.360
Pepperoncini?

44:24.419 --> 44:27.119
There are not so many artists, I
believe...

44:28.046 --> 44:29.316
 who are working so hard,

44:30.029 --> 44:31.847
like Marina does.

44:31.951 --> 44:33.751
But she is always very... 

44:34.168 --> 44:35.833
very elegant.

44:37.155 --> 44:38.155
And ...

44:38.696 --> 44:41.619
And I look... I look like
a worker in the field.

44:41.649 --> 44:44.399
Of course I am a worker
in the field of art.

44:44.602 --> 44:47.552
But I look like a worker
but I do much less work.

44:50.456 --> 44:52.706
So, you know, you know what I mean.

44:54.641 --> 44:55.841
I'm just lazy.

45:01.193 --> 45:04.243
"Nightsea Crossing" consisted
of a man and a woman

45:04.273 --> 45:06.643
sitting opposite each
other on two chairs.

45:06.778 --> 45:08.230
Sitting motionless 

45:08.365 --> 45:09.365
silent.

45:11.388 --> 45:12.388
Fasting.

45:14.458 --> 45:16.208
What it mainly was about,

45:16.543 --> 45:19.668
tremendous dislikes in Western society.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.951
Inactivity, inaction is discredited.

45:24.501 --> 45:28.319
Silence is discredited.
And fasting is discredited.

45:28.423 --> 45:32.019
So these are the 3 things which
could upset people pretty much,

45:32.049 --> 45:36.669
especially when you went for 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

45:37.185 --> 45:40.046
13, 14, 15, 16 days.

45:40.660 --> 45:43.559
Inactive, silent, fasting,

45:43.589 --> 45:45.959
absolutely motionless,

45:46.063 --> 45:47.913
which is almost impossible.

45:51.523 --> 45:55.255
We did "Nightsea Crossing" for
90 days, non-consecutive days.

45:55.373 --> 45:56.952
Once I stood up.

45:58.689 --> 45:59.839
I had enough.

46:02.205 --> 46:04.372
Woman can sit better than man

46:04.402 --> 46:05.852
because of anatomy.

46:07.149 --> 46:09.249
And I got up after 13 or 14 days

46:10.335 --> 46:11.685
because my ribs... 

46:12.282 --> 46:14.532
 were pushing
so hard on my spleen

46:15.043 --> 46:17.688
that I went to the hospital and they said:

46:17.718 --> 46:19.968
"Well, you should stop fasting."

46:21.306 --> 46:24.075
I lost then already 24 pounds.

46:24.244 --> 46:26.113
So that was...

46:26.143 --> 46:29.007
 just over the limit,
I think, on my part.

46:29.126 --> 46:30.376
Once.

46:32.777 --> 46:34.915
One of the reasons that he
said that he could not sit,

46:34.945 --> 46:37.413
he was so skinny that he
was sitting on his bones

46:37.443 --> 46:39.438
and it was just penetrating
through his skin.

46:39.468 --> 46:41.879
OK, Yogi guys do the same.
But he didn't.

46:41.909 --> 46:44.826
So anyway, and then he said,
"You have to stand up

46:44.856 --> 46:47.281
because performance
can't be without me."

46:47.364 --> 46:49.212
And I, I didn't see the reason.

46:49.391 --> 46:52.249
That's why in this "Nightsea
Crossing" I'm continue.

46:52.279 --> 46:54.119
I always... I'm continue,

46:54.149 --> 46:55.899
but there is empty chair.

47:08.176 --> 47:11.585
I never have had a
relation with a woman,

47:11.817 --> 47:13.322
neither with a man,

47:13.450 --> 47:15.939
of such a degree of...

47:16.083 --> 47:17.828
 symbiotic quality.

47:18.175 --> 47:20.575
So 12 years, well, we were burning up.

47:28.970 --> 47:31.085
The Marina-Ulay collaboration,

47:31.410 --> 47:34.641
in a simple, direct and profound way,

47:35.411 --> 47:37.611
expressed the male-female dynamic

47:38.890 --> 47:41.690
and then reaches this
kind of epic conclusion

47:42.529 --> 47:44.930
with the walk on the Great Wall of China...

47:45.029 --> 47:46.899
called "The Lovers."

47:47.357 --> 47:49.172
It's beyond operatic

47:49.202 --> 47:50.602
in its proportion.

47:54.278 --> 47:55.537
"The Lovers, "

47:56.017 --> 47:59.367
in which Marina and Ulay walked
the Great Wall of China,

48:00.229 --> 48:01.762
was an epic.

48:02.801 --> 48:05.894
The 3 months process of
walking...

48:05.924 --> 48:07.772
  towards each other...

48:09.083 --> 48:10.251
very simple,

48:10.813 --> 48:12.197
really pared down,

48:12.560 --> 48:14.710
and extraordinary in its clarity.

48:20.154 --> 48:23.884
This was the last of
their Relation Works.

48:26.463 --> 48:27.637
And, of course,

48:27.667 --> 48:30.711
the way the Great Wall walk ended...

48:30.741 --> 48:32.641
was with their splitting up.

48:37.233 --> 48:40.687
We very soon become
this great art couple

48:40.887 --> 48:43.914
and everybody was projecting
like a perfect image.

48:43.944 --> 48:46.173
In reality, he was not
happy with his position

48:46.203 --> 48:50.046
and somehow the more better pieces
we'd been doing in the performance,

48:50.216 --> 48:53.567
the worse our relation
will get in private.

48:54.865 --> 48:57.996
And later on, it's like his interest
was different than my interest

48:58.026 --> 49:00.286
and he was really kind
of experiencing life,

49:00.316 --> 49:02.666
go for drinking, go for the drugs.

49:02.889 --> 49:07.030
And then he became unfaithful,
which was very hard for me.

49:08.272 --> 49:10.337
We were monogamous.

49:10.367 --> 49:12.062
Till a certain point

49:12.166 --> 49:16.031
when the tightness of that
ideology  

49:16.061 --> 49:17.611
  started to unravel,

49:18.477 --> 49:19.627
started to...

49:21.342 --> 49:22.994
 disintegrate a little bit.

49:24.484 --> 49:26.903
Then she had at the same time...

49:26.933 --> 49:29.767
a sexual adventure with
somebody like I had.

49:30.757 --> 49:31.995
The same time.

49:32.817 --> 49:35.867
Except she did it with a
friend of ours. I didn't.

49:36.237 --> 49:37.237
Wow.  

49:37.542 --> 49:39.392
I shouldn't have said that.

49:45.373 --> 49:48.528
Took us about 8 years of
negotiations to get permission

49:48.558 --> 49:50.060
to walk the Chinese Wall,

49:50.090 --> 49:52.883
and during the negotiations,
many times he had to take a trip to China.

49:52.913 --> 49:54.537
And she was a translator.

49:54.939 --> 49:58.942
And when we finished Chinese walk,
he told me that she was pregnant.

49:59.046 --> 50:01.993
And he asked me, "What I should do?"
And I said, "What you should do..."

50:02.023 --> 50:04.973
you know, I leave and you
do whatever you want."

50:05.831 --> 50:07.882
So, they married.

50:09.234 --> 50:13.149
It is like, you know, like it began.
It ended like it began.

50:13.179 --> 50:16.331
It began like this and
it ended like this.

50:18.465 --> 50:19.515
That's all.

50:24.430 --> 50:26.377
After I split with Ulay 

50:26.407 --> 50:29.207
it was the
most dramatic moment of my life.

50:29.337 --> 50:32.443
I remember writing in
my diary, I was 40,

50:32.853 --> 50:34.853
I was fat, ugly, and unwanted.

50:35.945 --> 50:39.922
And I said, God, I lost man
I love and I lost my work

50:39.952 --> 50:41.427
because it was working together.

50:41.457 --> 50:43.691
It was nothing there. It was empty.

50:43.956 --> 50:47.453
And I was like, new beginning or
I am going to totally, you know,

50:47.483 --> 50:50.033
go down and destroy
myself in depression.

50:52.163 --> 50:56.413
And this was the moment that I went
first time get some money in Paris

50:56.504 --> 50:59.386
and I bought first designer clothes.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.318
And I felt so good.
I went to hairdresser,

51:02.626 --> 51:04.776
I went to the pedicure, manicure.

51:05.206 --> 51:06.500
I was like, wow.

51:06.832 --> 51:09.369
Wow, so what is, like,
price for this kind of jacket?

51:09.399 --> 51:11.552
This is unpayable. You can't pay this.

51:12.011 --> 51:15.444
Price... the price of couture,
they start from 8,000 to...

51:16.440 --> 51:18.536
can go to 200,000 300,000 400,000 Euro.

51:18.566 --> 51:20.893
- Depends.
- Yeah, depends on the pieces.

51:20.929 --> 51:24.773
And all this stuff, you know,
I made all this work. I, I'm fine.

51:24.941 --> 51:27.191
Why not feel good and wanted again?

51:27.761 --> 51:31.297
And, and since then, I really say,
"Oh, God, I really love fashion."

51:31.327 --> 51:34.453
And, and it was a kind of secret desire.

51:34.862 --> 51:36.737
I mean, this looks amazing.

51:37.151 --> 51:39.323
What do you think? Really. Wow.

51:40.444 --> 51:44.004
Being a performance artist in the
seventies to mid-eighties is poverty.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.056
Point. Full-stop.

51:47.915 --> 51:51.540
Bye-bye, extremes.

51:54.432 --> 51:57.682
After we broke off,
she got into theater productions

51:58.825 --> 52:00.525
because there was money.

52:04.318 --> 52:07.618
Bye-bye, Ulay!

52:10.519 --> 52:14.779
I mean, the new works of her,
a highly formalist aesthetic.

52:18.452 --> 52:21.652
So she clearly had made a
step to the theater world.

52:23.305 --> 52:24.949
Very much staged.

52:25.170 --> 52:27.026
With theatrical touch to it.

52:32.080 --> 52:36.618
Marina is a much more theatrical,
a much more emotional, a much more...

52:37.859 --> 52:39.285
dramatic artist...

52:40.049 --> 52:42.286
than this show shows.

52:45.830 --> 52:50.105
The risk at the MoMA
exhibition will be...

52:50.865 --> 52:54.101
how far it goes into being theatrical.

52:56.434 --> 52:58.559
Marina often says there's a difference:

52:58.589 --> 53:01.745
when you perform, you have a
knife and it's your blood;

53:02.234 --> 53:05.430
when you are acting, it's ketchup
and you don't cut yourself.

53:06.941 --> 53:09.298
If we lose that in the MoMA performance,

53:09.328 --> 53:12.593
if it's just a fake knife
and ketchup, then we lost.

53:24.481 --> 53:26.181
I've been in bed 6 days.

53:28.611 --> 53:30.451
In bed, that's it.

53:32.781 --> 53:36.634
Shit, shit, shit, shit. I didn't
leave this bed since 6 days now.

53:38.118 --> 53:40.132
I was so desperate,
I was taking everything.

53:40.162 --> 53:42.512
Anything anybody bring me, I take it.

53:42.958 --> 53:45.122
But then I discovered
this syrup with Codeine.

53:45.152 --> 53:46.730
This is amazing stuff.

53:47.226 --> 53:50.411
I never take drugs but the
Codeine really makes you happy.

53:50.687 --> 53:52.755
I slept like a baby yesterday, actually,

53:52.785 --> 53:55.383
With a smile through
all night on my face.

53:56.377 --> 53:57.259
Like idiot.

53:58.323 --> 54:00.049
Anyway, there I am.

54:00.359 --> 54:01.908
I think red is very good here,

54:01.938 --> 54:04.053
because I always think
that red gives strength.

54:04.083 --> 54:07.733
So if I have red color,
red bed sheets, red shawl, red pajama,

54:08.597 --> 54:11.097
red oranges, I, I maybe get better soon.

54:14.256 --> 54:15.011
OK.

54:16.956 --> 54:18.378
That was my monologue.

54:28.477 --> 54:30.177
How are you doing today?

54:30.581 --> 54:33.525
Shit hit the fan, that's how.

54:35.810 --> 54:37.939
I'm really freaking out.
There's no show.

54:37.969 --> 54:39.643
We're, we're getting ready.

54:39.812 --> 54:42.662
Is it possible for Marina
to see a projection?

54:42.734 --> 54:44.780
Let me see one projection. Any kind.

54:44.810 --> 54:47.137
- We don't have power. - Huh?
- We don't have power.

54:47.167 --> 54:50.480
And we don't even have the
source to play them on anyway.

54:50.510 --> 54:53.361
Or the players. Sorry. Not yet.

54:54.504 --> 54:56.815
There's nothing. There's nothing.

54:56.845 --> 55:00.378
I mean, it's 5 days before the show.
Looks like there's no show.

55:01.199 --> 55:03.699
What makes me most nervous is this room.

55:04.630 --> 55:07.233
The walls are not even in place.

55:08.217 --> 55:10.813
- Can we start rehearsals?
- Yeah. -That's the most important.

55:10.843 --> 55:12.553
Can we get everybody there?

55:12.583 --> 55:13.962
Please come. Hello.

55:13.992 --> 55:16.623
Ahhh... yes, fine. Come.

55:19.184 --> 55:22.634
So can we sit down two seconds?
I wanted to see everybody.

55:24.984 --> 55:25.984
Ok

55:31.472 --> 55:32.360
Hello.

55:33.204 --> 55:37.154
It's so different than our workshop
in the countryside, I tell you.

55:37.184 --> 55:38.226
I'm going through hell.

55:38.256 --> 55:41.435
And you know, one thing is so important
to be open about all this shit

55:41.465 --> 55:44.930
because it's like I can't pretend
now I am in Zen shit, but I am not

55:44.960 --> 55:49.110
And also, you know, I didn't even have
personal contact with any of you.

55:49.358 --> 55:53.160
I have to trust you with my life,
for this show, for this 3 months.

55:53.190 --> 55:55.692
There's no other way.
Because it's like, you know...

55:55.722 --> 55:59.422
I have to be really, have all
my energy to make my own piece,

56:00.067 --> 56:02.617
knowing that everything
is fine upstairs.

56:10.614 --> 56:13.577
Thank you very much for
coming to MoMA tonight.

56:13.886 --> 56:17.149
I'm the curator for the Marina
Abramovic retrospective.

56:18.162 --> 56:20.967
And that said, I would
like to introduce Marina.

56:30.402 --> 56:32.843
So... Thank you very much to Marina.

56:32.873 --> 56:36.101
We thought we should open
the podium for questions.

56:36.366 --> 56:39.576
One last chance to ask
her something directly,

56:39.817 --> 56:42.226
otherwise you have to wait until June.

56:43.203 --> 56:47.377
I suggest it's so late,
let's have 3 real good questions.

56:48.433 --> 56:50.255
- And at least one personal.

56:50.285 --> 56:52.072
- How do we know that before?

56:54.320 --> 56:57.820
Personal question.
You seem happy. Are you?

57:00.206 --> 57:02.079
Depends.

57:02.336 --> 57:06.586
You know, so what I can say, I just...
I'm very happy that I am by myself

57:06.992 --> 57:10.978
because who I can live with to do
this next 3 months what I want to do.

57:11.095 --> 57:13.422
There's no human being
who will stay with me.

57:13.452 --> 57:16.952
Because I, because I'm like in
a military drill, you know.

57:17.199 --> 57:19.782
I'm in this real complete concentration

57:19.812 --> 57:21.812
about doing this 3 months' work.

57:21.842 --> 57:24.677
Because it looks like simple,
I'm just in Atrium

57:24.707 --> 57:27.935
and having one position and a chair.
But it's not like that.

57:27.965 --> 57:31.454
It's extremely difficult because you
have to really be like a mountain.

57:31.484 --> 57:34.597
I want to create some kind of
stillness in the middle of the...

57:34.627 --> 57:36.127
of the, of the hell.

57:36.250 --> 57:39.502
And... and for that, I have
to be in right state of mind,

57:39.532 --> 57:42.178
so I have to restrict
myself with everything.

57:42.208 --> 57:44.207
And it's winter.

57:44.237 --> 57:46.564
When I come out,
it's going to be summer.

57:46.757 --> 57:49.761
Because that will be 31st of May.

57:55.020 --> 57:57.121
Marina is one of the
most significant artists

57:57.151 --> 57:59.847
of the second part of the 20th century.

58:00.828 --> 58:03.988
What is so amazing about Marina is that
she's really, you know...

58:04.018 --> 58:06.768
invents situations where nobody has been yet.

58:06.985 --> 58:08.477
Her practice is extreme.

58:08.507 --> 58:10.757
54 between Fifth and Sixth, please.

58:12.249 --> 58:15.143
In New York, tens if not
hundreds of thousands of people

58:15.173 --> 58:18.277
will be invited to make an experience
they've never made before.

58:26.090 --> 58:28.886
MoMA is the most significant
context in the world

58:28.972 --> 58:31.398
for any living artist to make a show.

58:38.348 --> 58:42.552
I really see the chance that the
performance art become mainstream art.

58:42.861 --> 58:46.840
And with this kind of show in the Museum
Modern Art what never happened before,

58:47.087 --> 58:48.637
it's the big chance.

58:49.689 --> 58:52.439
That incredible feeling
of responsibility...

58:52.834 --> 58:56.332
for performance in general.
It's not just for myself.

59:00.653 --> 59:03.453
I'm feeling like Marie Antoinette
going to...

59:04.580 --> 59:06.080
to cut her head off.

59:06.910 --> 59:09.634
The inability to keep going,

59:10.069 --> 59:12.236
the potential of giving up

59:12.626 --> 59:15.576
will become part of the
performance if it occurs.

59:16.265 --> 59:18.237
It could be a fiasco.

59:18.380 --> 59:20.250
I mean, there are no rules.

59:25.745 --> 59:29.577
"The Artist Is Present" is
a hugely courageous piece.

59:30.127 --> 59:32.722
Because it's a piece that can fail.

59:36.390 --> 59:37.790
Klaus...

59:38.170 --> 59:39.170
I love you.

59:40.096 --> 59:42.416
- Is this OK?
- You look beautiful.

59:42.855 --> 59:43.855
Thank you.

01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.911
That was, uh, 5 years living.

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:43.661
5 years living.

01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:47.022
Isn't it great?

01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:48.649
Yeah. It is.

01:01:14.977 --> 01:01:18.385
Yeah. That's the other one.

01:01:19.624 --> 01:01:21.224
They are simultaneous.

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:17.820
Now, Ulay is not there.
Now there is no life's partner.

01:05:18.964 --> 01:05:21.714
Now the audience is,
in quotes, "her lover."

01:07:18.257 --> 01:07:21.318
You've been a very bad girl. A very...

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:24.620
Well, that was Beyonce in a
new video with Lady Gaga.

01:07:24.909 --> 01:07:28.554
And Sandy Rios does not like
Lady Gaga's latest video.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.268
This should be outlawed.
It should be banned, personally.

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:33.505
There is a limit to what
we should tolerate.

01:07:33.535 --> 01:07:37.224
You know, I find it interesting because
you've got this Lady Gaga video out now

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:41.593
and, and literally in today's "New York
Post, " there's an article about...

01:07:42.007 --> 01:07:44.959
this exhibit at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

01:07:45.764 --> 01:07:49.057
where daring patrons squeeze
through two live nude performers

01:07:49.473 --> 01:07:53.073
alternating couples, opposite and same-sex,
who stand in a narrow doorway

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:57.619
of the new exhibit, which is by some
Yugoslavian-born provocateur.

01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:02.137
As you listen to the sound of this woman's
constant, guttural screaming and moaning.

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:05.274
That they say is art! And it's at MoMA!

01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:14.841
They want to film the galleries.
No. Do we have an interview? No.

01:08:14.871 --> 01:08:19.520
I sent them the statement and our still
images, like 4 images from the exhibition.

01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.352
You know, we're not trying
to stop the coverage.

01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:23.960
We're just not going to
have a circus going on.

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:25.077
Inside.

01:09:44.942 --> 01:09:48.335
Friday we had some... some, you know,

01:09:48.365 --> 01:09:50.464
weirdos but... we were expecting it.

01:09:51.943 --> 01:09:56.402
It's a definite... some people is starting
to understand that it's possibly a stage.

01:09:56.432 --> 01:10:00.114
You know, possibly an important window.

01:10:00.144 --> 01:10:02.150
The problem of the day was

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.300
that we established a signal
of emergency for Marina.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.482
So if she raise her hand...

01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:09.509
It could mean many things,

01:10:09.659 --> 01:10:12.867
but essentially it means, please ask the
person that is sitting with me to leave

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.374
- for some reason.
- Yes.

01:10:14.404 --> 01:10:17.145
I don't feel comfortable.
I am scared. I don't feel well.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.802
Many different reasons. Yeah.

01:10:20.845 --> 01:10:24.780
This thing that she's like sort of
cleaning the, cleaning the thing.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.114
And then boom!

01:10:26.144 --> 01:10:28.944
It's like It
reconnect and it's only for you.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:32.562
So each and every one, had like a clean

01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:35.142
unique and personal contact with
Marina.

01:10:35.938 --> 01:10:37.592
Boom. Like a magnet.

01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:56.193
What is so beautiful about
the MoMA performance...

01:10:57.393 --> 01:11:01.234
she's treating, actually,
every human being she is encountered

01:11:01.453 --> 01:11:04.533
with the same attention and same
respect. That's pretty shocking.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.570
And some people are... shocked by this

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:11.681
and some people anyways think
they deserve this attention,

01:11:11.865 --> 01:11:14.361
and they are finally
where they should be.

01:11:14.836 --> 01:11:17.485
And others fall in love with her.

01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:30.437
There's so many different reasons why
people come to sit in front of me.

01:11:34.432 --> 01:11:36.692
Some of them, they're angry.
Some of them curious.

01:11:36.722 --> 01:11:39.444
Some of them just want
to know what happen.

01:11:43.111 --> 01:11:44.735
Some of them...

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:46.620
they're really open

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.216
and you feel incredible pain.

01:11:51.231 --> 01:11:53.381
So many people have so much pain.

01:11:59.395 --> 01:12:02.852
When they're sitting in the front of me,
it's not about me anymore.

01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:09.820
It's very soon, I'm just the
mirror of their own self.

01:12:40.873 --> 01:12:44.638
Somebody told me the other day
that for most masterpieces,

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.350
people stand in front
of it for 30 seconds.

01:12:47.433 --> 01:12:49.292
"Mona Lisa"... 30 seconds.

01:12:49.684 --> 01:12:52.323
People come and sit here all day.

01:12:58.589 --> 01:13:01.164
The world is moving so fast now.

01:13:01.915 --> 01:13:04.220
People barely have an
attention span at all.

01:13:05.058 --> 01:13:07.803
She slows everybody's brain down.

01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:12.209
She asks us to stay there
for quite a length of time,

01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:14.982
which we are not used to doing.

01:13:17.774 --> 01:13:21.070
She transforms us as a result.

01:13:32.438 --> 01:13:35.874
Marina's an artist that visualizes time.

01:13:37.487 --> 01:13:41.336
Using her body in the
space with the audience.

01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:47.401
By the mere duration she
brings time

01:13:47.736 --> 01:13:49.091
 in as a weight.

01:13:49.749 --> 01:13:52.565
The weight on the performer's shoulders,

01:13:54.915 --> 01:13:58.115
taking a piece out of the
performer's life as a value.

01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:05.551
Time is not an ephemeral
just rushing by.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.283
Just imagine...

01:14:11.023 --> 01:14:12.023
time...

01:14:12.408 --> 01:14:15.709
as an unbearably large
object you cannot move.

01:14:15.739 --> 01:14:17.816
And you are caught in.

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:40.842
The performance is finished.
We are closing the space. Thank you.

01:15:44.989 --> 01:15:46.351
We're closed. Thank you.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.296
- We open at 10:30 tomorrow.
- My, my last one.

01:15:49.326 --> 01:15:51.629
No, no, no. Come back
tomorrow. Be with me.

01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:54.759
- Come back tomorrow, OK?
- You give me a chance?

01:15:54.836 --> 01:15:57.038
When you come back tomorrow,
we'll talk about it.

01:15:57.068 --> 01:15:59.256
- You'll give me a chance.
- No, I'm not give you a chance.

01:15:59.286 --> 01:16:01.838
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- You said so. - No, I didn't say so.

01:16:01.868 --> 01:16:04.629
- I've got my witness.
- Ladies, let's, let's move.

01:16:05.297 --> 01:16:08.430
You OK? You want me to get a wheelchair?

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.536
No, no. My foot's asleep.

01:16:11.551 --> 01:16:13.350
It's coming back.
Just give me a couple seconds.

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:17.133
- OK. Hi, Tony.
- I was sitting on the ground a long time.

01:16:54.723 --> 01:16:57.078
Kids, this is about limit.

01:16:59.117 --> 01:17:00.869
Even for me.

01:17:08.361 --> 01:17:09.161
Oh, God.

01:17:17.942 --> 01:17:21.247
It was strange today.
I had this enormous pain

01:17:21.277 --> 01:17:23.821
but at the same time when
announcement arrive,

01:17:24.352 --> 01:17:26.340
I was thinking it was, it was mistake.

01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:29.218
It was incredibly...
I was expecting another 3 hours.

01:17:29.602 --> 01:17:32.007
I was thinking it was so short.

01:17:32.284 --> 01:17:33.712
I don't know.

01:17:33.773 --> 01:17:35.538
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Today.

01:17:36.405 --> 01:17:38.069
I saw her having pain.

01:17:38.099 --> 01:17:41.746
I saw and heard the guards
saying that they are worried.

01:17:42.353 --> 01:17:45.888
So, I say, "If you think
you ruin your health;

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.213
"if you think you damage your body,

01:17:48.879 --> 01:17:50.979
then I offer you officially
now

01:17:52.515 --> 01:17:53.672
to end the performance."

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:56.095
So, so painful.

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:02.846
She just say, "No, it would never
be an option." So she was like...

01:18:03.438 --> 01:18:06.994
not even considering it, not even
listening to the end of my sentence.

01:18:07.024 --> 01:18:10.611
She was just saying, "No,
I would never, never consider this."

01:18:36.752 --> 01:18:40.352
There is pain, but the pain is
like a kind of keeping secret.

01:18:41.853 --> 01:18:44.659
The moment you really go
through the door of pain

01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:46.939
you enter to another state of mind.

01:18:53.252 --> 01:18:56.763
This feeling of beauty and unconditional
love and this feeling of...

01:18:56.793 --> 01:19:00.493
there is no kind of borders
between your body and environment.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.701
And you start having this
incredible feeling of lightness...

01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:07.689
and harmony with yourself

01:19:08.678 --> 01:19:12.514
It's something become like a,
like a holy. I can't explain.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:22.075
And that other state of mind is
exactly what public start feeling

01:19:22.162 --> 01:19:24.524
that something is different.

01:19:49.355 --> 01:19:51.712
Performance is all about state of mind.

01:20:01.247 --> 01:20:03.532
The public is like a dog. 

01:20:03.562 --> 01:20:05.698
They can
feel insecurity, they can feel fear,

01:20:05.728 --> 01:20:07.828
they can feel you are not there.

01:20:09.282 --> 01:20:12.978
So the idea is how you can bring
performer and the audience

01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:16.541
in the same state of
consciousness, here and now.

01:21:55.848 --> 01:21:58.469
- Would you...
- Take this table.

01:21:58.499 --> 01:22:01.499
- Would you move it with me?
- Can I put this down?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.652
What is under the, the feet?
What is under it?

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.741
It's nothing.

01:22:10.027 --> 01:22:11.751
It's just a little glue
to keep it in position.

01:22:11.781 --> 01:22:13.866
Stay, Marina. Don't move.

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:27.436
It's so interesting that I could not do
without table in the first two months.

01:22:27.466 --> 01:22:30.155
I need to have structure.
I need to have the table.

01:22:30.185 --> 01:22:33.311
And the table have to kept there
until I really got to the point

01:22:33.341 --> 01:22:37.091
- that I actually don't need the table.
- Let's switch it off.

01:22:39.463 --> 01:22:41.902
And once this table is removed,

01:22:41.932 --> 01:22:44.716
- it's so much more direct.
- I'm, I'm gonna open it for you.

01:22:44.746 --> 01:22:47.657
How do you feel about it?
What do you think is the difference?

01:22:47.687 --> 01:22:50.695
The difference is that there is no
buffer from security point of view

01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:53.115
there is no buffer between two of them.

01:22:53.145 --> 01:22:55.686
You know, like if somebody
is going to do something

01:22:55.716 --> 01:22:58.409
there's nothing preventing
someone from doing something.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:02.185
That's the only thing I feel but
we're just going to instruct everyone

01:23:02.215 --> 01:23:06.466
that has to sit in front of her that you
cannot move, touch or do anything.

01:23:10.095 --> 01:23:13.595
She makes herself so much more
vulnerable. It's so much more direct.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.969
There's no obstacle between her and
the audience. So she was right.

01:23:18.698 --> 01:23:20.578
Priest doesn't need the cross.

01:24:53.001 --> 01:24:54.941
- Put your numbers out.
- What is this?

01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:58.711
This is the self-imposed number
system for Marina Abramovic.

01:25:00.754 --> 01:25:02.204
We are almost done.

01:25:02.879 --> 01:25:04.868
You said this in April, too.

01:25:06.029 --> 01:25:09.856
These are details. You cannot grab
a few minutes here and there.

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:13.124
- Few minutes?
- What's one month, year,

01:25:13.228 --> 01:25:16.128
- one week here, one week there.
- You bastard!

01:25:17.023 --> 01:25:20.314
- Don't need to concentrate on the...
- On the details. - The details.

01:25:20.344 --> 01:25:21.913
- You need to...
- Big picture.

01:25:21.943 --> 01:25:25.013
- Keep focused on the big picture.
- That's right.

01:25:28.358 --> 01:25:29.558
OK, I am fine.

01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:33.144
You're fine?

01:25:36.388 --> 01:25:39.838
The museum is now open. Walk!
Walk, please! Walk! Walk.

01:25:50.336 --> 01:25:53.786
- I think I'm 5?
- She's 5, I'm 4.

01:25:54.909 --> 01:25:55.909
Allora

01:25:56.123 --> 01:25:58.885
One... Two... Three

01:26:05.998 --> 01:26:09.758
I stand in the line several days,
and I didn't get...get in.

01:26:09.788 --> 01:26:11.839
- You've been sitting there?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:11.869 --> 01:26:15.500
When? - Yesterday I was there at 5:00
in the morning. I didn't make it.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:17.518
It's very...

01:26:18.905 --> 01:26:21.091
now at the end, it's very competitive.

01:26:26.343 --> 01:26:29.029
People camping out all
night, and waiting,

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:34.214
it throws open the whole kind of rock
star question. Performance star. And...

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.329
basically, a groupie question.

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:41.823
You know, I think what's fantastically
interesting about her work and this work

01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:44.313
is the blank slate aspect of it.

01:26:44.436 --> 01:26:47.536
What it brings out in
everyone from the art world,

01:26:47.566 --> 01:26:50.922
people that claim they
know the work very well...

01:26:51.026 --> 01:26:53.364
- (Which one is she?)
- people that are part of this vocabulary

01:26:53.394 --> 01:26:54.863
and this language

01:26:54.893 --> 01:26:57.048
and then outright strangers.

01:26:57.078 --> 01:27:00.311
And people that come in and go,
"Well, why is she doing this?"

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:04.102
And that's endlessly interesting because
what you're really seeing is this

01:27:04.507 --> 01:27:08.326
giant canvas also of projections.

01:27:49.887 --> 01:27:52.569
Marina's connection to the audience

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:58.179
comes out of this extraordinary lack
that she feels, or she felt as a child.

01:28:02.294 --> 01:28:05.363
She desires to be loved,
she desires to be needed.

01:28:16.498 --> 01:28:19.315
Marina does have the experience

01:28:19.345 --> 01:28:23.155
that she needs the audience

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:24.928
like air to breathe.

01:28:27.944 --> 01:28:30.344
That's the gasoline she is running on.

01:28:31.568 --> 01:28:34.568
She lives for her art.
She lives for the audience.

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:39.196
When I met her...

01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:43.214
I thought: "Oh, God,
she's in love with me."

01:28:43.714 --> 01:28:46.064
And it took me a while

01:28:46.237 --> 01:28:49.239
to understand that she is
in love with the world.

01:28:49.943 --> 01:28:51.493
So it's not personal.

01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:53.936
"Don't take it personal.
I'm in love with the world.

01:28:53.966 --> 01:28:56.082
I'm not in love only with you."

01:28:57.266 --> 01:29:00.316
I realize she is repeating
this misunderstanding

01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:03.590
with every single person in the atrium.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:25.109
You OK, Mom?

01:29:27.455 --> 01:29:29.115
What's the matter?

01:29:29.723 --> 01:29:31.473
I'm OK. I'm proud of you.

01:29:36.009 --> 01:29:38.459
I don't know if the public idolize me.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:42.523
It's, it's their own thing how
they project, but it's not my aim.

01:29:43.174 --> 01:29:47.124
It's like, you know, if you come to
the certain point of your career

01:29:47.563 --> 01:29:50.564
you are idolized, you have
the money and you are famous,

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:53.747
but this is not the aim of the art.
It's just a side effect.

01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:58.110
It's like a B-product.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.860
I love B-product!

01:30:11.167 --> 01:30:15.015
In a way, like, everybody's around,
and you're kind of aware of them, but...

01:30:16.295 --> 01:30:18.902
the connection with Marina is
so strong that it doesn't...

01:30:18.932 --> 01:30:22.158
- Really pushes it away. - It's...
- (Is she acting, do you feel?)

01:30:22.188 --> 01:30:25.389
No, but it's that... I mean,
if you say it's acting, it's...

01:30:27.474 --> 01:30:29.982
only thing maybe that's similar is
that there are people watching you.

01:30:30.012 --> 01:30:33.094
The sacrifice of oneself
for a performance,

01:30:33.124 --> 01:30:36.472
it seems that that's always
involved in acting. - Maybe. Maybe.

01:30:36.502 --> 01:30:38.439
- Are you an actor?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:30:38.469 --> 01:30:41.569
OK. You have that sense of...
you have that presence.

01:30:41.809 --> 01:30:42.947
Yeah, good.

01:30:44.457 --> 01:30:48.107
May I have your attention, please?
The museum is now closed.

01:30:48.662 --> 01:30:52.085
Please return your MoMA audio
program units to the desk

01:30:52.115 --> 01:30:55.015
on the ground floor and
collect your belongings.

01:31:12.889 --> 01:31:17.889
You know that Tunji told me that
750,000 people saw the show?

01:31:18.823 --> 01:31:20.773
This is like almost million!

01:31:22.647 --> 01:31:26.730
I feel like we should prolong it for some
month more so we can get the million.

01:31:32.957 --> 01:31:36.405
Let's go. Let's go. This is for the,
from the cook? The cook?

01:31:36.435 --> 01:31:39.035
- Yes, yes, yes.
- He's genius, this guy.

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:45.325
Who was this look, look,
good-looking Asian man?

01:31:46.683 --> 01:31:48.059
I like him.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:53.447
Can we get some telephone numbers here?
He was really nice. Sexy.

01:31:54.325 --> 01:31:56.317
We are close to end!

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.335
After I saw Marina's
exhibit the first time

01:32:01.365 --> 01:32:04.715
I am, like, really inspired
to get into performance art.

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:08.072
To make my own performance
art and to... to do it.

01:32:08.176 --> 01:32:12.045
And I feel like being here is actually,
like, kind of a piece in itself, like...

01:32:12.075 --> 01:32:14.636
dedicating this much commitment to her.

01:32:17.419 --> 01:32:20.835
We are there, kids. Almost there.

01:32:22.772 --> 01:32:26.622
Next time Saturday, I'm in the country.
Which is really something.

01:32:28.975 --> 01:32:31.675
I wish I had a number
but I don't have one.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.519
I came all the way from
Australia to sit with Marina.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.396
Do you need a number?

01:32:42.422 --> 01:32:45.017
I am sad and happy... all together.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:56.270
Marina, we're taking you past 53rd so
you can see the queue.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.680
For the last time.

01:32:57.710 --> 01:33:00.415
They started, I think,
Wednesday night, or Thursday night.

01:33:00.445 --> 01:33:03.493
One girl had the great
idea to come at...

01:33:03.924 --> 01:33:05.623
around 10 P.M.

01:33:05.784 --> 01:33:06.853
What? God.

01:33:06.883 --> 01:33:10.197
And then for the day after, people just
don't, they don't leave the place.

01:33:10.227 --> 01:33:12.557
People that are like,
they are up to sit.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:16.044
They just get out of the museum and
sit in front until the morning.

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:36.689
My God, this is amazing.
This is the last day, you know.

01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:39.886
I don't think anybody imagined... this.

01:33:40.184 --> 01:33:43.611
What time is now? What time?
It's now 10:13... 10:15.

01:33:43.715 --> 01:33:46.281
- Can, can we do the chairs?
- Sure. - We can do the chairs.

01:33:46.311 --> 01:33:49.333
We already... we are already
planning. I know what to do.

01:33:49.509 --> 01:33:52.513
I'll give ya a piece of paper and
then we'll do 15-minute intervals.

01:33:52.543 --> 01:33:54.789
You'll just go out,
tap the person on the shoulder

01:33:54.819 --> 01:33:56.408
and tell them their time is expired.

01:33:56.438 --> 01:33:58.235
Your time is up. Performance is over.

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.330
The museum is not going
to open until 10:30.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.469
But we are going to let 40 people in.

01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:05.789
If you are not planning to sit in front
of Marina, you don't have to come in now

01:34:05.819 --> 01:34:09.580
You can wait until we open the museum
so that we can give enough people...

01:34:43.399 --> 01:34:46.534
21 times sitting with Marina
has this powerful meaning

01:34:47.328 --> 01:34:50.467
Were you expecting to be
transformed or did you just

01:34:50.497 --> 01:34:52.540
No, it was just, when I saw
it the first time, I came

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:54.934
and, you know, wanted to
experience it and then,

01:34:54.964 --> 01:34:57.334
you know, everything,
everything happened.

01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:31.170
Get him back down.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.791
We have come to sit with Marina,
Whore of Babylon, and confess.

01:35:41.551 --> 01:35:45.225
Speech superfluous,
pure form against pure form,

01:35:45.721 --> 01:35:48.368
the reflection of an
emptiness full of value.

01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:52.706
We have come as the last
spectators before the Crucifixion.

01:35:53.281 --> 01:35:55.942
We sit as Apostles at her table.

01:35:56.412 --> 01:35:59.546
And our nonchalance betrays her.

01:36:01.042 --> 01:36:03.525
And look, it's like,
it's a matter of time

01:36:03.555 --> 01:36:06.273
before firing someone in
the face is gonna be art.

01:36:10.345 --> 01:36:12.812
You're going to sit across
from the artist in silence.

01:36:12.842 --> 01:36:15.783
There are no distractions
distractions of any sort.

01:36:16.397 --> 01:36:19.738
No gestures, don't speak to the
artist, don't move your hands.

01:36:19.768 --> 01:36:22.018
- What's the matter? Are you all right?
- Yeah. - You nervous?

01:36:22.048 --> 01:36:23.916
- We've been waiting 16 hours.
- OK, well...

01:36:23.946 --> 01:36:25.865
your moment is coming up shortly.

01:36:25.895 --> 01:36:28.135
All right, I'll let you know. Thank you.

01:37:14.982 --> 01:37:16.091
Yep. Let's go.

01:37:20.809 --> 01:37:21.809
Just finish

01:37:21.839 --> 01:37:24.426
OK, we need... we need
somebody sitting, please

01:37:24.627 --> 01:37:26.997
Come on, let's go.
I know, I know, I know.

01:37:27.599 --> 01:37:30.956
We need to get... the performance needs to
continue. Then you've got to wait for Tunji.

01:37:30.986 --> 01:37:33.222
Really? We need... the
performance needs to continue.

01:38:33.483 --> 01:38:36.939
I think there's maybe still hope that I'll
get upstairs so I'm like, I don't know

01:38:36.969 --> 01:38:39.119
if you guys should be filming me.

01:38:40.072 --> 01:38:41.072
So...

01:38:41.352 --> 01:38:43.214
I would love to just
sit across from her.

01:38:43.244 --> 01:38:45.952
I mean, I didn't know it was
a rule. I didn't realize.

01:38:45.982 --> 01:38:49.806
And I would have obvi... I would
have obeyed the rule if I had known.

01:38:49.836 --> 01:38:52.608
But I wanted it to be spontaneous.
I didn't want anybody to know.

01:38:52.638 --> 01:38:55.706
You know, I wanted it to be like
my own thing and special with her.

01:38:55.736 --> 01:38:59.141
And I thought in that space,
in that square, like, you get your own,

01:38:59.171 --> 01:39:01.891
you know, it's like the,
the audience is part of the art.

01:39:01.921 --> 01:39:04.093
You know, and, and, and we bring to it,

01:39:04.123 --> 01:39:08.276
and I just wanted to be as vulnerable to
her as she makes herself to everyone else.

01:39:13.331 --> 01:39:16.092
I actually think the
exhibition is a self-portrait.

01:39:16.232 --> 01:39:19.783
That's her. There she sits
and she gives it all.

01:39:24.032 --> 01:39:26.532
She always talks about the here and now.

01:39:26.859 --> 01:39:31.122
But this piece, the title,
"Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present"

01:39:31.152 --> 01:39:32.802
that's a self-portrait.

01:39:40.156 --> 01:39:42.406
She did create a charismatic space.

01:39:42.965 --> 01:39:45.675
A little rent in the
fabric of the universe

01:39:45.773 --> 01:39:48.607
that was wholly her
own that she occupied.

01:39:49.969 --> 01:39:53.269
And she did it in a room
filled with many, many people.

01:39:53.421 --> 01:39:56.913
And many, many people felt that
charismatic space...

01:39:56.943 --> 01:39:58.093
as a reality.

01:39:59.233 --> 01:40:01.533
That's an extraordinary achievement.
