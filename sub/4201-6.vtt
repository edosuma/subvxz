WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:03.536
April:
PREVIOUSLY ON
CHASING LIFE...

00:03.571 --> 00:07.307
YOU AND I ARE
ACTUALLY COMMITTING TO
SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES,

00:07.341 --> 00:09.609
POTENTIALLY THE VERY
FEW DAYS WE HAVE LEFT,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.378
TIED DOWN
TO ANOTHER PERSON.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.413
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL THAT GRAHAM'S
COMING TO THE WEDDING?

00:13.446 --> 00:15.249
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HAVE A HOT GUY

00:15.282 --> 00:18.184
ON MY ARM TO SHOW
THAT WARBY-PARKER
BESPECTACLED PESCATARIAN

00:18.219 --> 00:19.687
THAT I HAVE MOVED ON.

00:19.719 --> 00:23.123
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HER,
AND I DO WANT HER BACK.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.091
LEO!

00:27.094 --> 00:28.763
CAN I TAKE YOU OUT
FOR AN OFFICIAL
THANK-YOU LUNCH?

00:28.795 --> 00:30.498
NOW'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.167
Looks like I'm going
to be busy for a while.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.737
-(bells pealing)
-April's voice:  WHEN YOU
HOLD ONTO LEO HENDRIE'S HAND,

00:37.771 --> 00:40.274
YOU HOLD ONTO LIFE ITSELF.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.276
HE LIVES EVERY MOMENT
WITH PASSION,

00:42.308 --> 00:44.110
- AND INFECTS
THE WORLD WITH JOY.
-(cell phone buzzes)

00:44.145 --> 00:45.813
OOH, MAYBE NOT
THE WORD "INFECT."

00:46.045 --> 00:48.448
NOT THAT EVERYONE
WON'T ALREADY BE THINKING
ABOUT SICKNESS.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.484
I MEAN, HELLO.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.387
I SHOULD AVOID MAKING
ANYONE THINK ABOUT CANCER,

00:53.420 --> 00:55.756
EVEN THOUGH CANCER
DID BRING US TOGETHER.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.125
MAYBE THAT'S A WEIRD WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.194
- I NEED A NEW VERB.
-(keyboard clicking)

01:00.226 --> 01:03.197
-(gasps)
-NOT TO STARTLE YOU, BUT...

01:03.229 --> 01:05.665
YOU'VE GOT THE LEAD ROLE
IN THIS PRODUCTION.

01:05.698 --> 01:08.168
GET THAT BRIDAL BUTT UP HERE!

01:08.201 --> 01:09.537
SORRY!

01:09.569 --> 01:11.539
HAVE I MENTIONED HOW GREAT
IT IS THAT YOU'RE HERE?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.206
IT'S SO GREAT THAT YOU'RE HERE.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.646
YOU'VE GOT FANS.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.515
YOUR GIRLS
DO WONDERS FOR MY EGO.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.685
I'M JUST SORRY
MAE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.820
WELL, SHE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.856
THIS WAY I GET
A LITTLE ALONE TIME
WITH THE CARVER WOMEN.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.158
AFTER THE MUSIC
AND THE READINGS,

01:32.192 --> 01:33.394
WE'LL MOVE ONTO THE VOWS.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.162
YOU'VE WRITTEN
YOUR OWN, CORRECT?

01:35.195 --> 01:37.397
YES, AND THEY'RE
GONNA BLOW YOUR MIND.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.165
HOWEVER AWESOME
YOU THINK THE BIBLE IS--

01:39.200 --> 01:40.266
AND I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S AWESOME,

01:40.301 --> 01:42.135
BUT THESE ARE GONNA
BE EVEN AWESOMER.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.271
PRETTY CONFIDENT, ARE WE?

01:44.305 --> 01:47.140
OH NO, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MINE.
I'M TAKING ABOUT YOURS.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.575
SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL WRITER.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.411
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
PLENTY OF TISSUE IN THE SEATS,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.445
BECAUSE TOMORROW,
HER VOWS

01:52.479 --> 01:54.215
ARE GOING TO DESTROY.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.783
(Leo and April chuckle)

01:58.618 --> 02:01.822
-(theme music playing)
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

02:01.855 --> 02:04.858

02:04.891 --> 02:09.796

02:09.830 --> 02:14.768

02:19.205 --> 02:20.373
(laughter)

02:20.407 --> 02:22.342
OH, THIS REHEARSAL DINNER
NEEDS AN AFTER-PARTY.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.444
-I'M PUTTING YOU IN CHARGE.
-(gasps)

02:24.478 --> 02:27.348
I'M THE QUEEN
OF AFTER-PARTIES. PERFECT.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.883
NAT AND I CAN THROW SOMETHING
TOGETHER AT OUR PLACE.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.484
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.818
OH, NOTHING TOO ADULTY.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.521
HMM.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.756
I'LL SHOOT A TEXT
TO EVERYONE I KNOW
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A MORTGAGE.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.393
Leo: SO, YOU GUYS SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING? IT'S

02:39.425 --> 02:42.228
ALL PRELIMINARY,
BUT I TOLD YOUR FATHER

02:42.263 --> 02:43.597
WHAT AN ASSET YOU'D BE.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.199
I'M SORRY, AN ASSET FOR...

02:45.231 --> 02:46.766
WHAT, EXACTLY?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.368
A NEW PHILANTHROPIC ELEMENT

02:48.401 --> 02:49.502
TO OUR COMPANY--

02:49.537 --> 02:50.771
A COMMUNITY OUTREACH

02:50.804 --> 02:52.706
AND ACTIVISM DIVISION.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.741
OH, RIGHT, OKAY, AND YOU NEED ME

02:54.775 --> 02:56.710
TO COME UP WITH A SEXIER NAME

02:56.743 --> 02:57.745
FOR IT, IS THAT IT?

02:57.777 --> 02:59.780
DON'T DROWN THE MOMENT
IN SARCASM, LEO.

02:59.812 --> 03:02.782
YOUR FATHER WANTS YOU
TO RUN THE WHOLE DIVISION.

03:02.816 --> 03:06.687
I'VE SEEN YOUR ROBIN-HOOD
SENSIBILITIES UP CLOSE.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.656
YOU'VE TOUCHED
A LOT OF LIVES, SON.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.425
WHAT WOULD I BE DOING, EXACTLY?

03:11.457 --> 03:14.260
SHAPING THE DEPARTMENT,
HOW IT OPERATES.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.263
I'D BE PROUD TO HAVE YOU
ON OUR TEAM.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.831
SO, THINK ABOUT IT

03:18.865 --> 03:20.800
AND GET BACK TO ME
OR MY ASSISTANT

03:20.834 --> 03:22.735
WHEN YOU'VE MADE
YOUR DECISION.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.204
(Leo clears throat)

03:27.740 --> 03:29.276
-SO, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE IT?
-I DON'T KNOW.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.712
I MEAN, I CAN HARDLY SAY
THE WORDS "HENDRIE AFFILIATED"

03:32.746 --> 03:34.581
WITHOUT THROWING UP
IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.750
-(groans)
-IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH BILE.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.719
IT COULD BE A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY, THOUGH.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.622
YOUR LAST JOB WAS IN PARIS,

03:41.655 --> 03:43.691
WAKING UP AT 2:00 A.M.
TO ROLL CROISSANTS.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.925
OH, IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED
"KWA-SANS."

03:45.960 --> 03:47.427
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.764
BUT YOU LOVED
THAT BAKERY JOB.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.667
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO PUT
A SUIT AND TIE ON EVERY DAY

03:53.700 --> 03:55.368
AND CALL YOUR DAD "BOSS"?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.871
THERE ARE DEFINITELY
PROS AND CONS.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.875
BUT... THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A WHILE. THERE'S NO RUSH.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.846
-YEAH.
-IT IS RIDICULOUS

04:05.878 --> 04:07.580
HOW MANY MORE RESPONSIBILITIES

04:07.615 --> 04:09.483
MAIDS OF HONOR HAVE
THAN BEST MEN.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.884
I'M SURE FRANKIE'S DOING
A LOT FOR LEO, TOO, HONEY.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.387
SHE TOLD ME MOST
OF HER JOB TOMORROW

04:13.419 --> 04:15.556
IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT LEO WEARS SOCKS.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.257
HEY, YOU WERE DAD'S
BEST MAN, RIGHT?

04:18.292 --> 04:22.262
YEAH, BUT IT WAS A...
UNIQUE SITUATION.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.396
HOW WAS IT UNIQUE?

04:23.430 --> 04:25.699
LOTS OF BEST MEN ARE BROTHERS
OF THE GROOM.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.468
(laughs)

04:28.502 --> 04:29.769
YOU'VE KEPT IT A SECRET

04:29.802 --> 04:32.338
HER WHOLE LIFE FOR SOME REASON.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.274
WHAT HARM COULD IT DO?

04:35.776 --> 04:39.713
(chuckles) IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

04:39.747 --> 04:43.417
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, BEFORE
I EVEN MET YOUR FATHER,

04:43.449 --> 04:44.951
GEORGE AND I DATED.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.855
-SERIOUSLY?
-MMM. (chuckles)

04:48.889 --> 04:51.057
I SWEAR, THIS FAMILY BELONGS
ON  GAME OF THRONES.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.761
WELL, IT WAS SO LONG AGO, AND...

04:53.793 --> 04:56.764
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT, THEN YOUR
MOTHER MET THOMAS.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.831
SO IT ONLY HAPPENED
THAT ONE TIME, RIGHT?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.803
WAIT! NO, NO! NEVER MIND!

05:03.836 --> 05:05.773
I ACTUALLY-- I WANT ZERO DETAILS

05:05.805 --> 05:07.740
ABOUT MY MOM AND UNCLE'S
SEX LIVES.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.810
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
OPEN WITH YOU.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.077
WELL, THAT WAS WAY TOO OPEN.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.812
YOU NEED TO CLOSE IT BACK UP.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.815
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HELP, HONEY?

05:15.848 --> 05:18.786
WATCHING  EATEN ALIVE  WITH ME
ONE LAST TIME.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.653
STOP SAYING, "ONE LAST TIME."

05:20.687 --> 05:21.889
IT'S DEPRESSING.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.023
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.891
EMMA'S GOING AWAY
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.526
SO, HOW ARE YOU DOING

05:26.560 --> 05:28.028
WITH SO MUCH CHANGE SO QUICKLY?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.663
DOES THIS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

05:31.764 --> 05:34.735
WELL, YOU--
IF YOU EVER NEED ME,

05:34.768 --> 05:36.470
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.872
THANK YOU, GEORGE.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.709
THAT MEANS MORE TO ME THAN
YOU PROBABLY REALIZE.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.014
-(laughing)
-ALL RIGHT, DON'T SHOOT
THE MESSENGER,

05:47.047 --> 05:48.781
-BUT IT'S 11:30.
-(rock music playing)

05:48.816 --> 05:50.417
-OHH...
-YEAH.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.951
ALL RIGHT. WELL...

05:51.985 --> 05:53.987
GO BACK TO OUR PLACES
AND GET OUR BEAUTY SLEEP.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.488
YOU GUYS
KEEP DRINKING, THOUGH.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.057
DRINK UNTIL YOU HEAR SEMISONIC.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.358
-THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.
-(laughs)

05:59.393 --> 06:01.394
ARE YOU GUYS DOING THE WHOLE
NOT SEEING EACH OTHER UNTIL
THE "WEDDING MARCH" THING?

06:01.427 --> 06:03.529
OH MY GOD. THE NEXT TIME
YOU TWO SEE EACH OTHER,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.966
YOU'RE GONNA BE
BRIDE AND GROOM!
OH, I LOVE THAT.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.935
ALL RIGHT.
LEO, SINCE I AM YOUR D.D.,

06:08.968 --> 06:10.903
I'D BETTER "D" YOU HOME.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.639
OKAY. YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.675
OH, WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS KISS
LAST UNTIL TOMORROW.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.980
-(both moan)
-LET THE MAN BREATHE, APRIL.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.082
-(laughter)
-AHEM! OKAY.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
-BYE.
-BYE.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.822
-SEE YA.
-BYE.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.524
(chattering)

06:31.557 --> 06:34.495
APRIL, DID YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE A LITTLE RASH
ON YOUR SHOULDER BLADE?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.795
OH YEAH, I SAW IT YESTERDAY.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.031
IT'S A POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECT
OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL,

06:38.064 --> 06:40.033
SO OF COURSE
ONE SHOWS UP NOW.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.802
BUT AT LEAST IT'S--
IS THAT GRAHAM?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.906
-ANYONE WITHOUT A MORTGAGE.
-(chuckles)

06:48.776 --> 06:53.447
-HEY, GRAHAM.
-HELLO... EVERYONE.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.014
I'M SORRY
I'M A LITTLE LATE.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.050
BUT I BROUGHT YOUR GIFT
A LITTLE EARLY.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.653
-OH. A MORTAR AND PESTLE.
-NOW YOUR HOMEMADE HUMMUS

06:59.685 --> 07:00.987
WILL BE AS AUTHENTIC
AS POSSIBLE.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.524
NO MORE MACHINE-GROUND
CHICKPEAS FOR YOU.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.425
-(both laugh)
-IT'S JUST WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.829
SO, IS DOMINIC
COMING TONIGHT?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.531
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CATCH UP WITH HIM,

07:10.564 --> 07:12.966
BUT I FEEL LIKE MY TEXTS
ARE GOING TO A BLACK HOLE.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.067
YEAH, I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT GUY.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.702
HE'S A MYSTERY
WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA

07:16.737 --> 07:18.672
WRAPPED IN A HENLEY,
AM I RIGHT?

07:18.704 --> 07:20.574
YEAH, HE'S A QUESTION MARK.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.543
(kissing)

07:24.812 --> 07:27.447
WELL, IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE DRINKING ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE APARTMENT.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.824
- ♪ 'Cause I know you
want it just as bad as I do ♪
-(April knocks on door) DOMINIC?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.026
♪ Come on, baby ♪

07:39.058 --> 07:41.627
DOMINIC, I CAN HEAR
YOUR MUSIC THROUGH THE DOOR.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.862
(music stops)

07:49.870 --> 07:52.572
HEY, COME ON IN.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.612
-HEY.
-HEY.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.716
OH MY GOD, YOUR EYE!

08:02.749 --> 08:03.916
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:05.786 --> 08:08.588
OH, IT'S NOTHING.
I WENT ON A BIKE RIDE
THIS MORNING,

08:08.622 --> 08:12.125
AND YOU KNOW THOSE LAMPPOSTS
BY THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.927
-I CLIPPED ONE.
-YOU CLIPPED A LAMPPOST?

08:14.961 --> 08:17.264
YEAH, I KNOW,
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.165
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T MAKE IT
TO YOUR PARTY, BY THE WAY.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.535
I'VE BEEN UNDER A ROCK LATELY
BETWEEN THE BOOK AND  THE POST.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.004
-IT'S ALL PILING UP.
-I GET IT.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.908
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.110
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
CHECK ON ME THE NIGHT
BEFORE YOUR WEDDING.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.511
YES, I DID. LOOKING AROUND
THE PARTY TONIGHT

08:32.546 --> 08:34.147
AND NOT SEEING
YOU THERE MADE ME...

08:34.181 --> 08:36.950
REALIZE SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.124
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.662
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE THERE
FOR EACH OTHER'S MILESTONES,

08:48.695 --> 08:51.664
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU
AND LEO ARE BECOMING FRIENDS.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.836
NOW THAT YOU BRING IT UP...

08:57.604 --> 08:59.972
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT
TOMORROW EITHER.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.277
NINA NEEDS
THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS
ON MONDAY, AND...

09:03.309 --> 09:07.681
I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GO TO SOCIAL EVENTS
RIGHT NOW.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.049
(mutters)
"SOCIAL EVENT."

09:12.985 --> 09:15.154
WELL, YOU'LL BE MISSED.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.725
I GUESS, UM,
I'LL SEE YOU.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.036
GOOD LUCK TOMORROW.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.148
-OH.
-IS THAT BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.917
-YEAH, HAPPY WEDDING DAY.
-(chuckles)

09:43.951 --> 09:46.119
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU UP?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.587
-SHOULDN'T YOUR JET LAG GO
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION?
-UGH.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.124
DIDN'T REALLY
SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.927
HONESTLY,
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON...

09:55.928 --> 09:57.364
COULDN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.799
-HERE YOU GO.
-THANK YOU.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

10:00.801 --> 10:01.802
WELL...

10:02.802 --> 10:05.238
I KNOW YOUR FEELINGS
TOWARD HIM...

10:05.272 --> 10:07.307
ARE COMPLICATED
AND I GET THAT,

10:07.341 --> 10:10.376
BUT HIS LOVE
FOR YOU WAS... IMMENSE,

10:10.610 --> 10:13.613
AND I JUST WISH HE COULD
BE HERE TODAY. THAT'S ALL.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.015
HE WAS SO PROUD OF YOU.
(chuckles)

10:16.048 --> 10:17.750
THAT'S ARGUABLE.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.056
NATALIE FOUND A MANUSCRIPT
FOR A BOOK HE WAS WORKING ON.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.692
THERE WERE PARTS
THAT IMPLIED HE DIDN'T THINK
I WAS MUCH OF A WRITER.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.096
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOUR DAD AT ALL.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.099
AND ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN
TRUST THIS MANUSCRIPT?

10:32.131 --> 10:37.070
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
MOST OF THE CHARACTERS
ARE DEFINITELY INSPIRED BY US.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.408
BUT THEN AGAIN,
IT'S ABOUT A COLD WAR SPY

10:41.640 --> 10:43.275
WHO'S SECRETLY PLANNING
HIS OWN DEATH.

10:44.811 --> 10:49.349
WELL, I WOULDN'T
PUT TOO MUCH STOCK
IN AN UNFINISHED SPY NOVEL.

10:49.383 --> 10:52.284
AND BESIDES,
WHATEVER YOUR FATHER BELIEVED,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.086
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE WRITER.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.188
ALL OF BOSTON
KNOWS THAT FACT.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.957
THANKS.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.059
REPORTING'S DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

11:00.092 --> 11:05.131
IT'S LIKE THESE VOWS.
THEY REQUIRE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PART OF MY BRAIN,

11:05.164 --> 11:06.899
ONE THAT APPARENTLY...

11:06.932 --> 11:08.802
-(whispers) IS NOT WORKING.
-WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
YOU PRETEND

11:08.835 --> 11:10.703
TO BE A REPORTER AGAIN
FOR A SECOND.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.440
YOU ALWAYS USED TO ASK
THE "W" QUESTIONS, RIGHT?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.442
-AND "H"-- HOW.
-YEAH.

11:15.674 --> 11:19.413
WELL, I ALREADY KNOW THE HOW,
THE WHERE, THE WHEN,
AND THE WHO, SO...

11:19.446 --> 11:20.846
TELL ME THE WHY.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.884
WELL...
THE EASY ANSWER IS

11:24.918 --> 11:26.153
'CAUSE WE'RE IN LOVE.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.355
WE MAKE
EACH OTHER STRONGER...

11:29.789 --> 11:31.924
AND WE HAVE A BOND
THAT FEW PEOPLE CAN SHARE.

11:31.957 --> 11:35.227
WE BOTH HAVE HAD
TO EMBRACE LIFE
WHILE FACING DEATH.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.165
I WAS THINKING
A LOT ABOUT DEATH

11:39.198 --> 11:42.101
WHEN I FIRST REALIZED
I MIGHT NOT GET A WEDDING,

11:42.134 --> 11:45.772
BUT... LEO IS DETERMINED
NOT TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.974
WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.010
IS IT, THOUGH?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.780
GOD, IT SOUNDS
LIKE HE PROPOSED OUT OF PITY.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.784
NO, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
WILL THINK THAT.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.155
JUST DRINK YOUR CAFFEINE.
YOU'VE GOT A BIG DAY
AHEAD OF YOU.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.296
I WANT, LIKE,
THE SMOKIEST EYE POSSIBLE.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.432
I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE ME
AND THINK FOREST FIRES.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.469
-"MIDNIGHT RACCOON."
-THAT SHOULD WORK.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.772
HEY, FORD,
THANKS FOR VOLUNTEERING
TO BE AN USHER.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.041
OH, SURE, YEAH.
I'M ONLY IN IT
FOR THE FREE MAKEOVER.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.744
I REALLY NEED HELP
EVER SINCE SEPHORA
BANNED ME FOR LIFE.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.913
THEY SAID, "NO TRAVELING
UNTIL THE HIP REPLACEMENT,"

12:27.947 --> 12:30.850
SO, IT'S JUST ME THIS TIME.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.052
BUT ARTIE SENDS HIS BEST.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.221
OKAY, I GOTTA HEAD BACK
TO LOGAN AND PICK UP MAE.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.490
-I'LL BE BACK
IN A BIT, OKAY?
-OKAY.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.892
-HOPE HER FLIGHT'S
NOT LATE.
-OKAY.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.094
-YUP.
-(both giggle)

12:41.128 --> 12:44.264
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
I HAVE TO GO STEAM "THE DRESS."

12:44.297 --> 12:46.799
-LADIES, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
-(gasps)

12:46.832 --> 12:49.836
-GRANDMA! YOU MADE IT!
-OH, DARLING. OH!

12:49.870 --> 12:53.173
TODAY IS GOING TO BE
ONE OF THE BEST DAYS
OF YOUR LIFE!

12:53.206 --> 12:56.076
WELL, BRENNA IS
CERTAINLY MAKING IT
ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.777
-BRENNA.
-HI.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.947
OH! AND--
OH, NATALIE.

13:01.981 --> 13:06.086
IT HAS BEEN SO LONG
SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.288
UH, I SMELL
WHITE DIAMONDS. HELP ME!

13:08.321 --> 13:10.289
Emma:
ACTUALLY, LYNN,

13:10.322 --> 13:12.491
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER
IS THE OTHER BRUNETTE.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.929
I'M YOUR SON'S
SECRET SHAME, REMEMBER?

13:16.962 --> 13:20.366
OKAY. WOULD YOU STILL
LIKE A HUG?

13:20.399 --> 13:24.336
SURE. THAT'LL MAKE UP
FOR SEEING ME ONCE
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.106
-(scoffs)
-YOU TWO JUST NEED SOME TIME

13:27.139 --> 13:29.509
TO CATCH UP
AND GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER.

13:29.543 --> 13:33.145
I THINK YOU'LL
BE SHOCKED BY HOW MUCH
YOU HAVE IN COMMON.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.980
FOR EXAMPLE...

13:35.014 --> 13:38.250
LYNN IS ALSO GOOD
WITH NASTY COMMENTS.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.453
YOU WANT MY HELP OR NOT?

13:42.455 --> 13:45.392
I GUESS A QUARTER OF MY GENES
DO COME FROM YOU,

13:45.424 --> 13:48.894
SO... THERE MUST BE A COUPLE
OF THINGS WE BOTH LIKE.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.096
AND DON'T LIKE.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.033
OKAY, FINE,

13:54.067 --> 13:57.437
BUT I'M DOING THIS
NATALIE STYLE.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.014
SO, OUR SUITS ARE
NICE, CLEAN, AND CRISPY.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.417
I'M THINKING A STRONG
MONOCHROMATIC PALETTE,

14:10.450 --> 14:13.953
LIKE REGIS PHILBIN,
WILL SHOW BETH THAT
I'VE MOVED ON.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.289
-LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS.
-LET YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.025
I DECIDED I'M NOT GOING.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.261
WHAT? COME ON,
IT'S A HENDRIE WEDDING.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.197
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY,
ORNATE, AND WASTEFUL,

14:24.230 --> 14:25.599
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO JUDGE IT.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.134
I DON'T THINK I CAN
WATCH HER STAND UP THERE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.972
SHE CAME BY LAST NIGHT,
AND IT WAS SO CLEAR--

14:33.005 --> 14:35.008
WE HAD SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL ONCE.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.644
AND THE FEELINGS
NEVER GOT ANY CLOSURE.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.513
YOU NEVER HAD
BREAK-UP SEX.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.582
-THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
-SO, YOUR TIME RAN OUT.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.085
SHE PICKED THE OTHER GUY,
AND IT BLOWS,

14:45.118 --> 14:47.187
BUT THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS BE A GOOD FRIEND

14:47.220 --> 14:48.455
AND SUPPORT HER
ON HER WEDDING DAY.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.293
-I CAN'T DO IT.
-ALL RIGHT, FINE.

14:53.326 --> 14:57.330
HEY, CAN A PLUS-ONE
STILL SHOW UP WITHOUT
THE ORIGINAL REAL GUEST?

14:57.364 --> 15:01.067
BECAUSE I NEED TO ROCK
THIS REEGE TONIGHT, BUDDY.
I NEED TO.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.206
AND... I THINK
WE HAVE THE WINNER.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.643
OH. EXCELLENT.
APPLY IT WITH A TROWEL
IF YOU NEED TO.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.111
-HI.
-HEY, FRANKIE.

15:12.144 --> 15:15.014
-HEY.
-THE HAIRDRESSER'S NOT
QUITE READY FOR ME YET,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.149
BUT I WAS TOLD I HAVE
EXACTLY 26 MINUTES.

15:17.182 --> 15:19.451
-YEAH, IT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
-TAKE A SEAT.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.421
Beth:
HOW'S ALL THE BEST MAN STUFF
GOING TODAY?

15:21.453 --> 15:25.024
WELL, THE GROOM'S WEARING SOCKS,
SO MY WORK'S COMPLETE.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.659
-(chuckling)
-THANK YOU.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.695
AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING
THE BACHELOR PARTY HAPPEN
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:28.927 --> 15:31.563
-YEAH.
-HOW'D IT GO?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.033
IT WAS FINE.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.537
HOW WAS DOMINIC?
WAS HE FINE?

15:37.570 --> 15:40.105
I MEAN, I THINK SO.
WHY? DID HE SAY SOMETHING?

15:40.139 --> 15:43.375
NO, BUT I VISITED HIM
LAST NIGHT, AND HE HAD
A BLACK EYE.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.245
YOU VISITED DOMINIC
LAST NIGHT?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.380
YEAH, HE TRIED
TO TELL ME IT WAS A BIKE INJURY,
BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ONE,

15:48.414 --> 15:51.951
AND HE'S BEEN OFF EVER
SINCE THE BACHELOR PARTY,

15:51.985 --> 15:55.120
-SO I FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING WENT DOWN.
-HMM.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.725
TALK TO YOUR FIANCEE.
I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.096
GET IN THE MIDDLE
OF WHAT, THOUGH?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.032
FRANKIE, WHAT HAPPENED?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.136
(sighs)
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.405
LEO PUNCHED DOMINIC
IN THE FACE.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.142
-WHAT?
-SERIOUSLY?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.644
(sighs)
I CAN'T BELIEVE
LEO WOULD DO THAT.

16:18.677 --> 16:22.182
ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE
DISAPPOINTED WITH LEO.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.482
WHAT'S THAT NOW?

16:25.351 --> 16:28.053
BETH, WHY DON'T YOU
GO AND CHECK AND SEE
IF THE HAIRDRESSER'S READY.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.293
SHOUT IF YOU NEED
ANY BACKUP.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.327
(clears throat)

16:36.696 --> 16:39.231
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
I DON'T "HAVE THE RIGHT"?

16:39.264 --> 16:42.601
YOU WEREN'T THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

16:42.634 --> 16:45.105
AND MAYBE INSTEAD OF SIDING
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.005
YOU GIVE YOUR FIANCEE
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.174
WELL, IT WOULD BE EASIER
TO GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT

16:49.209 --> 16:51.009
IF YOU WOULD JUST TELL ME
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.278
OH MY GOD!
I HATE WHEN GIRLS
GET LIKE THIS.

16:53.312 --> 16:56.081
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO EVERYONE CONNECTED
TO THE PROBLEM

16:56.115 --> 16:58.084
EXCEPT FOR THE PERSON THAT
YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.254
OKAY, SORRY I DON'T LIVE UP TO
YOUR HIGH BAR FOR WOMANKIND,

17:01.287 --> 17:03.789
BUT LEO OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T
WANT ME TO KNOW ABOUT THIS,

17:04.022 --> 17:05.525
AND I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.627
HE WASN'T THE ONE
WHO VISITED AN EX
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.064
DOMINIC IS MY FRIEND,
THAT'S ALL.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.699
WHATEVER.

17:12.731 --> 17:15.402
JUST SEEMS PRETTY UNGRATEFUL,
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
LEO'S DOING FOR YOU.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.605
I'M NOT A CHARITY CASE!

17:18.637 --> 17:21.106
THIS WEDDING IS SOMETHING
LEO AND I BOTH WANT.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.542
LOOK... TALK TO LEO.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.113
I THINK I SAW
A BLOW DRY BAR
BY THE HOTEL.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.662
WOW. YOU'RE ON TRACK
TO BEAT THE RECORD I SET
ON SPRING BREAK.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.230
(both laugh)

17:44.263 --> 17:46.499
OH, DO YOU
DRINK COMPETITIVELY?

17:46.532 --> 17:48.601
NO! THAT WAS A JOKE.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.775
OH, I WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT APRIL'S HEALTH.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.679
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS CLINICAL TRIAL.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.382
MAYBE YOU CAN
ANSWER THEM FOR ME.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.849
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:05.785 --> 18:09.455
YOU FINALLY GET SOME TIME
ALONE WITH THE GRANDDAUGHTER
THAT YOU KNOW THE LEAST,

18:09.489 --> 18:11.124
AND YOU'RE USING IT TO...

18:11.156 --> 18:13.125
GET DIRT ON ONE
OF THE OTHER ONES?

18:13.159 --> 18:16.195
NO. I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOU, TOO.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.531
OH, I JUST--
I HATE BEING OUT OF THE LOOP.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.471
I WAS OUT OF YOUR LOOP...

18:24.503 --> 18:26.205
FOR TWO DECADES.

18:26.239 --> 18:30.210
I RECENTLY READ
SOME OF THE LATER WORKS
THAT YOUR SON WROTE,

18:30.242 --> 18:32.778
AND HE DIDN'T SEEM
TO THINK TOO MUCH OF ME.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.547
I GUESS YOU DON'T EITHER.

18:36.148 --> 18:36.883
(sighs)

18:40.586 --> 18:42.855
(panting)

18:51.897 --> 18:54.867
Dominic's voice:
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR US

18:54.901 --> 18:57.604
-WHILE I'M GONE?
-IT'S FOUR MONTHS.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.708
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL OVER THE PLACE,
DIFFERENT TIME ZONES,

19:01.740 --> 19:05.612
MEETING PEOPLE.
I WANT YOU TO JUST
ENJOY THAT...

19:05.644 --> 19:08.515
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME OR ANYTHING.

19:09.848 --> 19:13.185
-BUT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I DON'T KNOW.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.589
I HAVE A LOT OF STUFF
TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW,
AND I THINK IT'S...

19:17.624 --> 19:19.925
PROBABLY BETTER THAT
I DO THAT ON MY OWN.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.712
SO, EVEN THOUGH
HE PUNCHED DOMINIC

19:40.747 --> 19:43.182
AND KEPT IT FROM ME,
I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO JUST...

19:43.215 --> 19:45.684
SHUT UP AND BE HAPPY
BECAUSE I'M THE CANCER BRIDE?

19:45.718 --> 19:48.954
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT.
THE ONLY ONE THAT'S CALLED YOU
"CANCER BRIDE" IS YOU.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.823
IS THIS WHAT
THEY CALL COLD FEET?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.459
APRIL, YOUR FIANCEE
IS HERE,

19:53.492 --> 19:55.862
AND I GOTTA SAY
WAY TO GO!

19:55.894 --> 19:57.564
LEO'S HERE? WHY?

19:57.596 --> 20:01.233
HE CAN'T COME UPSTAIRS!
HE CAN'T SEE APRIL!

20:01.267 --> 20:03.469
ACTUALLY, I JUST--
I JUST WANNA TALK TO APRIL,

20:03.502 --> 20:05.305
BUT I'LL--
I'LL STAY IN THE HALLWAY.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.943
-DON'T LOOK.
-(mutters) OKAY, OKAY.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.250
(sighs)
SO, I HEARD...

20:18.617 --> 20:21.621
YOU AND FRANKIE HAD THE KIND
OF CONVERSATION THAT...

20:21.653 --> 20:23.990
RICH LADIES ON REALITY SHOWS
USUALLY HAVE.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.960
(sighs)
WE EXCHANGED SOME WORDS,

20:26.992 --> 20:29.261
BUT AT LEAST
SHE TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.765
-WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU PUNCHED DOMINIC?
-(sighs)

20:32.798 --> 20:36.234
-I'M ABOUT TO BE YOUR WIFE.
-BECAUSE DOMINIC...

20:40.272 --> 20:43.509
HE WAS DRUNK,
I WAS DRUNK,
IT WAS JUST...

20:43.542 --> 20:45.877
ALPHA MALE ASSERTIVENESS
AT ITS WORST.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.380
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.284
BUT, IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THINGS WE SHOULDN'T
DO BEFORE WE GET MARRIED...

20:51.317 --> 20:52.951
(scoffs)

20:52.986 --> 20:55.020
WHY DID YOU
VISIT HIM LAST NIGHT?

20:56.722 --> 20:58.857
I WAS JUST CHECKING
ON A FRIEND.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.395
LEO... I LOVE YOU.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.798
YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANNA BE WITH.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.704
I HATE THAT WE'RE KEEPING
SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

21:12.739 --> 21:16.875
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-IT MEANS WE'RE HUMAN.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.980
YOU WANT HONESTY?
ASK ME SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.622
ARE YOU MARRYING ME
AS A GIFT?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.057
BECAUSE I'M DYING?

21:33.692 --> 21:35.994
(crying)
AM I ONE OF YOUR
ROBIN HOOD PROJECTS?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.034
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME?

21:42.067 --> 21:43.568
OF THIS WEDDING?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.940
(whispers)
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.011
(sighs)

21:53.046 --> 21:56.883
OKAY, LOOK...
COUPLES FIGHT ALL THE TIME,

21:56.915 --> 21:59.986
AND THEY...
WORK THROUGH IT.

22:00.019 --> 22:03.321
THIS IS JUST A BUMP
IN THE ROAD, RIGHT?

22:03.355 --> 22:04.824
RIGHT.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.492
A BUMP IN THE ROAD.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.066
I WANT TO MARRY YOU, APRIL.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.935
I WANT TO MARRY YOU, TOO.

22:24.943 --> 22:25.944
(sighs)

22:28.548 --> 22:30.415
(knocks on door)

22:31.983 --> 22:34.619
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR APRIL OR BRENNA,
THEY'RE NOT IN HERE.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.855
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU,

22:36.888 --> 22:41.760
BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK
FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.365
IT'S AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.037
SO I GOT NERVOUS,
AND THEN I DRANK.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.771
IT DOESN'T NEED
TO BE AWKWARD.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.074
JUST BE MY GRANDMA,
LIKE YOU'RE THEIR GRANDMA.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.009
(sighs)
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.880
I JUST...

23:00.913 --> 23:04.884
I JUST DON'T FEEL INCLUDED
WHEN I'M OUT HERE.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.689
EMMA, SHE LIVES
WITH APRIL AND BRENNA,

23:09.721 --> 23:12.491
SO SHE'S A PART
OF THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.994
BUT I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH THAT.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.932
ALWAYS COMING
IN SECOND PLACE?

23:21.933 --> 23:24.737
YEAH, I--
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.405
(whispers) YEAH.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.113
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

23:34.146 --> 23:36.982
I'LL TEXT YOU
UPDATES ON MY LIFE.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.984
I'LL SEND PHOTOS
AND EVERYTHING.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.087
THANK YOU.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.656
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.027
(clicking)

23:48.059 --> 23:49.996
-LET ME GET THAT.
-OH, THANK YOU.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.131
-THAT'S SO...
THERE YOU GO.
-THANK YOU.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.932
THERE YOU GO.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

23:53.965 --> 23:57.869
(gasps)
YOU TWO LOOK FANTASTIC.

23:57.903 --> 24:02.441
THANK YOU, AND SO DO YOU,
MOTHER OF THE BRIDE.

24:02.474 --> 24:05.644
-THANKS SO MUCH
FOR LETTING US CHANGE HERE.
-NO, OF COURSE.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.515
AND THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING HIM WARM
OVER THERE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.986
-(both chuckle)
-ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE CHURCH.

24:14.019 --> 24:15.020
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.154
-SEE YOU.
-OKAY.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.660
-(door opens)
-(whispers) "KEEPING HIM WARM"?

24:20.692 --> 24:21.760
(door closes)

24:21.794 --> 24:23.695
(rock music playing)

24:36.976 --> 24:38.845
DON'T FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.219
(people chattering)

24:46.251 --> 24:48.054
-THIS PLACE LOOKS INCREDIBLE.
-I KNOW.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.922
IT LOOKS LIKE PINTEREST
EXPLODED IN HERE.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.892
PLEASE ENJOY
THE OLD-FASHIONED
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN PAIN.

24:52.924 --> 24:54.926
THE PEWS DON'T GOT CUSHIONS.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.830
-OKAY.
-NICE.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.835
HEY.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.640
COME ON. I KNOW YOU CAN
USE MORE TONGUE THAN THAT.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.044
OKAY. OKAY. WHY IS IT
YOU ONLY GET EXTRA HANDSY

25:12.077 --> 25:13.546
WHEN DEATH CAB
OVER THERE SHOWS UP?

25:13.578 --> 25:15.748
I MEAN, CLEARLY,
SOMETHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.554
WELL, YEAH, WE USED TO DATE,
BUT IT'S BEEN OVER FOR MONTHS.

25:21.586 --> 25:25.924
AND YET YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT MAKING HIM JEALOUS
THAN BEING REAL WITH ME.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.627
THAT'S... NOT TRUE.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.832
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU TWO
OR HOW YOU ENDED IT,

25:32.865 --> 25:35.034
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN BEING USED.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.701
WAIT.

25:44.943 --> 25:48.047
-OKAY.
-EVERY BOX IS CHECKED.

25:48.079 --> 25:51.017
-THIS WEDDING IS A GO.
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:55.121 --> 25:58.723
YOU LOOK
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.

26:03.061 --> 26:06.898
BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING MISSING.
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY.

26:08.667 --> 26:13.306
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL
THIS OVERPOWERING JOY,

26:13.338 --> 26:15.607
THAT I'VE NEVER
FELT BEFORE, BUT...

26:17.076 --> 26:18.877
WHAT'S WRONG?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.846
IS THIS MEANT TO BE?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.950
IS LEO MY ONE TRUE LOVE?

26:23.982 --> 26:26.751
I FEEL LIKE I USE TO HAVE
THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS,

26:26.786 --> 26:29.087
BUT IN THE PAST 24 HOURS...

26:29.121 --> 26:30.957
I LOST THEM.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.694
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS
NO "ONE TRUE LOVE."

26:36.895 --> 26:39.298
-I'M ON MY SIXTH TRUE LOVE.
-(Sara laughs)

26:39.332 --> 26:41.834
-(laughs)
-YOU HAVE TO REALIZE

26:41.866 --> 26:44.670
MARRIAGE ISN'T ABOUT FINDING
THE EXACT PERFECT PERSON

26:44.703 --> 26:46.305
DESTINED TO BE
YOURS FOREVER.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.075
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT NO ONE'S EVER
GONNA COMPARE TO THEM,

26:49.107 --> 26:51.344
AND IT DEFINITELY
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA FIGHT.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.181
IT MEANS THAT
YOU'RE WILLING TO...

26:55.213 --> 26:57.215
PUT IN THE TIME
AND EFFORT...

26:58.217 --> 27:00.019
TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

27:02.387 --> 27:05.191
MARRIAGE ISN'T ABOUT ROMANCE.

27:06.224 --> 27:07.759
IT'S ABOUT COMMITMENT.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.863
COMMITMENT IS ROMANTIC.

27:18.703 --> 27:21.941
(rock music playing)

27:36.021 --> 27:39.025
("Wedding March" playing)

28:10.021 --> 28:11.891
-(sighs)
-YOU OKAY?

28:11.923 --> 28:13.092
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.994
-(people gasp)
-OH! APRIL!

28:16.028 --> 28:18.396
-(music fades)
-(murmuring)

28:42.153 --> 28:43.422
Hamburg: DIZZINESS,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH,

28:43.455 --> 28:44.923
COLLAPSED.
ANYTHING ELSE?

28:44.957 --> 28:46.424
I DON'T KNOW.
WE JUST NEED HER CONSCIOUS.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.232
(door opens)

28:54.266 --> 28:56.367
(panting)

28:56.402 --> 28:58.203
(door shuts)

29:06.178 --> 29:08.480
I ONLY STARTED
TO LOSE MY BREATH
A FEW MINUTES BEFOREHAND.

29:08.513 --> 29:11.750
-I THOUGHT IT WAS NERVES.
-AND WHAT ABOUT THE RASH?

29:11.784 --> 29:14.019
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.855
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.124
RASHES WERE LISTED
AS POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
ON THE WEB SITE.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.859
WELL, IT MAY BE A SIDE EFFECT,
AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
DETERMINE THAT,

29:20.893 --> 29:22.795
AND I CAN'T IF YOU DON'T
COMMUNICATE WITH ME.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.762
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT YOU'VE BEEN UNDER

29:24.797 --> 29:26.164
AN EXCEPTIONAL AMOUNT
OF STRESS LATELY,

29:26.198 --> 29:27.465
BUT OTHER
THAN WEDDING PLANNING,

29:27.500 --> 29:30.201
ARE THERE ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

29:30.236 --> 29:33.806
WELL, BERMUDA,
AND WE WENT TO RHODE ISLAND.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.907
AND A STRIP CLUB...

29:37.076 --> 29:39.444
-AND JAIL.
-APRIL, ARE YOU
WEARING A MASK

29:39.478 --> 29:42.147
IN ANY OF THESE
GERM-PRONE PLACES?

29:42.181 --> 29:45.518
I'LL WEAR ONE
ON OUR FLIGHT TO ITALY.
OUR HONEYMOON'S NEXT WEEK.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.186
APRIL, YOU CAN'T TRAVEL,
NOT IN THIS CONDITION.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.089
A CLINICAL TRIAL
IS NOT A FREE PASS.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.358
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO STOP LIVING MY LIFE
JUST BECAUSE I'M SICK.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.561
IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE
OF YOUR HEALTH, THERE WON'T
BE A LIFE LEFT TO LIVE.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.865
I'M GONNA RUN SOME TESTS
AND GET YOU SOME FLUIDS.

30:01.866 --> 30:02.968
YOU NEED A REST.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.111
(inhales sharply)

30:13.979 --> 30:15.280
I'M SORRY.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.486
(crying) I'M SORRY
I RUINED THE WEDDING,
AND I'M S...

30:20.519 --> 30:24.088
-I'M SORRY I'M SICK.
-HEY. HEY.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.925
HEY.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.094
I DO NOT ACCEPT
YOUR APOLOGY.

30:31.529 --> 30:34.133
YOU ASKED ME TODAY
IF I PROPOSED TO YOU

30:34.165 --> 30:35.901
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE DYING.

30:40.038 --> 30:43.375
(crying) I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION...

30:45.176 --> 30:46.412
IS, "YES, I DID."

30:51.150 --> 30:54.353
WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO THINGS
FASTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE...

30:55.954 --> 30:57.623
BUT I'M SO MADLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

30:57.855 --> 31:00.259
AND I KNEW
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

31:00.291 --> 31:02.228
THAT I WANTED
TO MARRY YOU SOMEDAY.

31:05.597 --> 31:08.500
SOMEDAY JUST CAME
SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.904
YOU'RE NOT JUST GRANTING
A DYING GIRL HER LAST WISH?

31:12.938 --> 31:14.339
(laughs)

31:19.345 --> 31:23.249
MARRYING YOU...
IS MY DYING WISH.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.365
THEY SHOULD'VE FIGURED
IT OUT BY NOW.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.667
I'M SURE THEY'RE DOING
ALL THEY CAN.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.670
Brenna:
IT'S SO DUMB,
BUT I JUST THOUGHT

31:44.903 --> 31:47.673
THAT IF TODAY
WENT PERFECTLY, THEN...

31:48.906 --> 31:51.910
IT WOULD ERASE THE CANCER
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.949
WELL, SOME THINGS ARE
BEYOND OUR POWER, DEAR.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.384
IT'S SO UNFAIR.

31:58.416 --> 32:02.320
NO, IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT SUCKS.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.557
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO APRIL,

32:05.590 --> 32:08.460
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOUR SISTER,

32:08.493 --> 32:11.029
AND YOU'RE
GONNA BE OKAY,

32:11.063 --> 32:15.166
BECAUSE YOU
ARE THE STRONGEST
KIND OF WOMAN--

32:15.200 --> 32:17.036
A REBEL WOMAN.

32:17.068 --> 32:21.307
-I'M A REBEL WOMAN?
-YEAH, FROM A LONG LINE
OF REBEL WOMEN.

32:21.339 --> 32:24.009
YOU HAVE THAT SPIRIT, BRENNA,

32:24.042 --> 32:26.010
BUT I CAN'T HIT THE ROAD

32:26.045 --> 32:29.347
WITHOUT YOU KNOWING
HOW STRONG YOU ARE.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.383
ARE YOU SURE
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE?

32:31.416 --> 32:35.054
(scoffs)
YOUR MOM'S STILL HERE.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.122
I'D RATHER TALK
TO A REBEL WOMAN.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.691
(laughs)

32:38.723 --> 32:43.061
YOU MEAN NOT YOUR MOM,
WHO GOT HORIZONTAL
WITH YOUR UNCLE?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.663
SHE'S DEFINITELY
A REBEL WOMAN.

32:45.698 --> 32:48.733
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
YOU ASK HER

32:48.967 --> 32:52.237
ABOUT THE SPRINGSTEEN
CONCERT IN 1983.

32:54.073 --> 32:58.344
-I'LL DEFINITELY BE SAVING
THAT INFORMATION FOR LATER.
-(both laugh)

33:01.145 --> 33:03.615
I'M SO GLAD
THAT WE HAD THIS TALK.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.192
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-I HEARD ABOUT APRIL.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.695
-I WANTED TO SEE
HOW SHE'S DOING.
-SHE'S CONSCIOUS AND STABLE.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.498
-OKAY.
-BUT SHE'S GOING
TO BE HERE FOR A WHILE,

33:19.530 --> 33:21.567
-SO THEY'RE
GETTING HER A ROOM.
-OKAY.

33:21.599 --> 33:25.136
I... THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
COMING TO THE WEDDING,

33:25.170 --> 33:27.038
BUT HERE YOU ARE,
ALL DRESSED UP.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.142
I GUESS YOU REALIZED
WHAT I ALREADY KNEW.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.679
I'VE DONE
A LITTLE SOUL SEARCHING.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.281
COME ON.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.386
(knocks on door)

33:45.356 --> 33:48.292
HEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

33:48.326 --> 33:51.462
JEEZ, CAN'T A GIRL COLLAPSE
AT HER OWN WEDDING

33:51.497 --> 33:53.298
WITHOUT EVERYONE
GETTING ALL WORKED UP?

33:55.099 --> 33:57.102
(chuckles)
I'M OKAY.

33:58.269 --> 33:59.704
JUST BEEN A CRAZY DAY.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.242
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR FIGHT WITH LEO.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.112
-YOU DID?
-YEAH.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.181
I'M SORRY.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.483
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
LEO'S BIGGEST FAN,

34:12.518 --> 34:14.052
AND I GET IT.

34:15.219 --> 34:18.222
BUT... I LOVE HIM.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.097
WELL...

34:26.764 --> 34:28.266
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.369
I AM.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.273
THEN I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.112
YOU'RE IN A SUIT.
WERE YOU GONNA COME
TO THE WEDDING?

34:40.144 --> 34:41.480
I...

34:42.648 --> 34:44.550
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MILESTONES

34:44.583 --> 34:47.686
AND... HAD A LAST MINUTE
CHANGE OF HEART.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.458
I WAS HOPING I WOULDN'T
BE TOO LATE, BUT...

34:53.458 --> 34:55.260
I GUESS I WAS.

35:00.364 --> 35:01.567
GET SOME REST.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.215
I'M TAKING YOU
OFF THE CLINICAL TRIAL.

35:17.248 --> 35:19.585
SO, IT--
IT WASN'T WORKING?

35:20.585 --> 35:23.554
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
THE CAUSE OF YOUR RASH
OR YOUR RESPIRATORY ISSUES,

35:23.588 --> 35:25.590
BUT WE REALLY CAN'T
RISK IT RIGHT NOW.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.293
SO, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.661
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO
STAY HERE A FEW DAYS
UNDER OBSERVATION,

35:30.695 --> 35:33.197
AND TAKE IT VERY, VERY EASY.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.436
(crying)

35:39.538 --> 35:41.773
DOCTOR, COULD I SPEAK
TO YOU PRIVATELY
FOR A SECOND?

35:44.909 --> 35:46.878
(whispering)

35:54.219 --> 35:57.456
HEY, HEY.
I'LL SEE YOU IN ONE HOUR.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.590
(crying)

36:00.192 --> 36:02.628
LOVE YOU.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.331
I'LL GET DESSERT
FROM THE CAFETERIA.

36:07.365 --> 36:10.335
-AND LEO MENTIONED FLOWERS.
-I'LL STEAL SOME FROM
THE COMA WARD.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.739
NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:13.771 --> 36:16.507
BREAK-UP SEX WAS
TOTALLY NECESSARY.

36:16.541 --> 36:19.510
YEAH, CLOSURE, RIGHT?
I THINK IT'S-- IT'S IMPORTANT.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.413
-YEAH, RIGHT.
-YEAH.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.884
-THANKS FOR BRINGING
THE CHAMPAGNE.
-OH YEAH. SURE.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.952
-THANKS FOR--
YOU'RE GONNA--
-OKAY.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.887
SORRY.
I'M ACTUALLY THIS WAY.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.489
-WHY DON'T YOU GO--
-OKAY.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.791
OKAY.

Emma:
AS OF SEVEN MINUTES AGO,

37:00.652 --> 37:04.389
I CAN LEGALLY OFFICIATE
AT THIS SHINDIG,

37:04.422 --> 37:06.291
-SO LET'S DO IT.
-(chuckling)

37:06.324 --> 37:07.326
UM...

37:09.460 --> 37:12.764
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO READ

37:16.434 --> 37:17.735

SO LET'S CUT
TO THE GOOD STUFF--
THE VOWS.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.840
LEO, YOU'RE UP.

37:29.780 --> 37:30.949
(laughs)

37:32.451 --> 37:34.853
WHEN I FIRST MET APRIL,

37:34.885 --> 37:36.855
I HAD A DEATH SENTENCE

37:36.887 --> 37:41.393
THAT I ACCEPTED,
BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER
THAN TRYING TO FIGHT.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.929
BUT THEN I SPENT
SOME TIME WITH APRIL CARVER...

37:46.697 --> 37:50.869
AND... EVERY DAY SHE FINDS

37:50.902 --> 37:52.903
NEW WAYS TO SHOW ME HOW...

37:53.905 --> 37:57.342
SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT...

37:58.443 --> 38:03.447
AND ABSOLUTELY
MIND-BLOWING LIFE CAN BE.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.789
WHY WOULD I NOT WANT
TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

38:10.822 --> 38:12.923
WITH THE PERSON
WHO TAUGHT ME WHY

38:12.958 --> 38:14.960
IT WAS WORTH FIGHTING FOR?

38:16.862 --> 38:18.730
I LOVE ADVENTURES.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.701
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER ONE...

38:23.969 --> 38:25.503
THAN LIFE WITH YOU.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.483
I'M SO HAPPY THE WEDDING'S
IN THIS ROOM.

38:40.385 --> 38:44.021
IT'S IN THIS VERY PLACE
THAT I TRIED TO HIDE
FROM MY FEARS.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.992
WHEN THINGS
GOT TOO HARD,
I RAN AWAY.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.661
I RAN HERE.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.063
AND RIGHT HERE...

38:53.532 --> 38:54.833
IS WHERE YOU FOUND ME.

38:56.534 --> 39:00.405
AND YOU TAUGHT ME
THAT COURAGE ISN'T
ABOUT BEING UNAFRAID.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.407
IT'S ABOUT...

39:02.440 --> 39:05.911
GIVING YOURSELF
NO OTHER OPTION THAN
TO FACE YOUR FEARS.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.782
A BRILLIANT WOMAN
ONCE TOLD ME THAT

39:11.817 --> 39:14.351
THE FOUNDATION
OF MARRIAGE IS LOVE...

39:15.387 --> 39:16.954
BUT THE REALITY OF IT
IS COMMITMENT.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.525
I'M SO LUCKY,
AND SO THANKFUL

39:21.559 --> 39:24.061
THAT I GET TO COMMIT
MYSELF TO SOMEONE

39:24.096 --> 39:28.699
WHO MAKES ME HAPPIER,
MORE COURAGEOUS,

39:28.733 --> 39:31.902
AND MORE EXCITED
ABOUT EVERY NEW MINUTE
OF MY LIFE.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.981
-(applause)
-WHOO!

39:46.418 --> 39:48.887
HEY, I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.088
GEORGE, YOU HAVE
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH
THE LEITENBERG TRIAL, RIGHT?

39:51.123 --> 39:53.391
YEAH. I HAD
A FEW PATIENTS
ON IT, YEAH.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.693
ANY CHANCE THAT YOU CAN
ASSIST WHILE WE FLUSH IT
FROM HER SYSTEM

39:55.726 --> 39:58.663
-AND DETERMINE
THE NEXT STEP?
-WELL... YEAH.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.532
YEAH, I CAN STICK AROUND
A FEW EXTRA DAYS.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.534
WE SHOULD ALSO DISCUSS
THE GENOME SEQUENCING,

40:02.567 --> 40:04.503
HELP US NARROW DOWN
HER OPTIONS.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.871
GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT,
I NEED TO COUNTERACT

40:06.905 --> 40:08.773
THAT CHAMPAGNE IN MY SYSTEM
WITH BURNT, BLACK COFFEE.

40:08.806 --> 40:10.809
-ANYONE CARE TO JOIN ME?
-THE MORE BURNT THE BETTER.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.043
-OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.983
WE'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

40:18.016 --> 40:20.918
TO FIGURE OUT
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.824

IF I NEEDED YOU, AND YOU ARE.
