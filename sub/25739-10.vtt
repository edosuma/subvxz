-Hey, man.

00:30.625 --> 00:31.666
You looking for
tickets or what?

00:31.749 --> 00:33.124
Oh, no, no.
I'm buying at the door.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.124
Thank you very much.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.791
Dude, this is Roachella!

00:35.874 --> 00:37.749
It's like the
animal kingdom's
Woodstock!

00:37.832 --> 00:38.874
No offense,
old Woodstock.

00:38.957 --> 00:41.500
(coughing)
Show me your tits! Whoo!

00:41.583 --> 00:42.749
Fuck off, creep!

00:42.832 --> 00:44.999
This show's been
sold out for, like, ever.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.500
Oh! This is not only
my first concert,

00:46.583 --> 00:48.083
but it is
a testing of my faith

00:48.166 --> 00:49.666
and I am
ready for that test.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.041
What--what are you,
like, Amish?

00:51.124 --> 00:53.083
-What is it?
Holy God.
-Yeah.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.583
I'm on my Rumspringa.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.124
Kid, I was gonna scam you.

00:56.208 --> 00:58.916
These tickets are just
fruit roll-ups I drew on.

00:58.999 --> 00:59.916
What's your name?

00:59.999 --> 01:01.791
Oh, Sherman.
Sherman Tortreform.

01:01.874 --> 01:02.749
Tortreform?

01:02.832 --> 01:04.416
Isn't that
some obscure law?

01:04.500 --> 01:07.041
It's a family name
passed down for many centuries.

01:07.124 --> 01:08.500
My cousins
married my cousins

01:08.583 --> 01:09.625
and my brothers...

01:09.707 --> 01:10.916
-Annie.
-Wonderful to meet you, Annie.

01:10.999 --> 01:12.416
Okay, Sherman.
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.957
I'm gonna wait
on line with you,

01:14.041 --> 01:15.458
to make sure you get in

01:15.541 --> 01:17.625
and don't immediately
get attacked and die

01:17.707 --> 01:19.583
because, let's face it,
you need someone.

01:19.666 --> 01:21.583
Okay. Thank you
for helping me.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.500
Praise be this Rumspringa!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.707
Roachella! Whoo!

01:25.791 --> 01:26.874
Jesus. Chill out.

01:28.416 --> 01:29.749
It says Roachella
right there!

01:29.832 --> 01:31.083
No, no, no! Dude,
it's a fucking
fruit roll-up!

01:31.166 --> 01:32.500
Look. See?
It's strawberry,
you prick!

01:32.583 --> 01:35.208
What the fuck?
I paid some bunny
300 bucks for this.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.957
Dude, putting on
a concert's a lot of work.

01:37.041 --> 01:38.124
-I don't like it.
-Yeah, man.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.291
Wayne's World 2
is a crock of shit.

01:39.375 --> 01:40.625
And honestly,
it's not even that good.

01:40.707 --> 01:42.166
Why don't we just
forget about the tickets?

01:42.249 --> 01:43.666
-Who cares?
-Yes!

01:43.749 --> 01:44.957
I mean, it kind of contradicts
the whole Roachella message.

01:45.041 --> 01:46.375
It's supposed to be
for everybody.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.957
One festival, one day.
All species, all genres.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.583
-Except math rock, obviously.
-Amen.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.458
Let's just let everybody
come in and do whip-its.

01:52.541 --> 01:53.874
Oh, my God.
That sounds so much better.

01:53.957 --> 01:55.291
Phil:
Everybody, come on in!

01:55.375 --> 01:58.124
Mr. Organbarf,
tear down that wall!

01:58.208 --> 01:59.707
Whoo!

01:59.791 --> 02:00.957
-Hey, my bosses.
-Hey!

02:01.041 --> 02:02.500
-Hey! There he is!
-Tim, how's it going, dude

02:02.583 --> 02:03.957
Good, good.
Thanks for having me on board.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.666
I'm excited to meet
the, uh, security squad.

02:06.749 --> 02:07.999
-Am I...
-Is that a band or something?

02:08.083 --> 02:09.208
Is that
Jared Leto's band?

02:09.291 --> 02:10.375
No, that's Suicide Squad,

02:10.458 --> 02:11.666
and that's a movie he's in.

02:11.749 --> 02:12.874
-Got it.
-Hold on a second.

02:12.957 --> 02:14.541
I'm not the whole
security staff, am I?

02:15.291 --> 02:16.999
I'm the whole thing?
I have one concern, though.

02:17.083 --> 02:20.166
-Sure.
-The ratio of
concertgoers to me...

02:20.249 --> 02:22.166
-Security.
-...is a good 10,000 to one.

02:22.249 --> 02:24.500
Well, think about these
poor public school teachers

02:24.583 --> 02:25.999
who've got, like,
classrooms with like,

02:26.083 --> 02:27.916
-40 kids in 'em and stuff.
-That's devastating.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.874
-They're the real heroes.
-They're not paid enough.

02:29.957 --> 02:32.333
-Yeah, so, you're good?
-Feel like you got everything?
Everything's clear?

02:32.416 --> 02:34.999
No, I don't.
I don't feel good
about the afternoon.

02:35.083 --> 02:35.957
-Sure.
-All right.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.541
That guy has
a laser pointer.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.957
That is the assault weapon
of juvenile mischief.

02:40.041 --> 02:42.500
All right, gotta go.

for us to be
like a tough guy,
bad dude gang,

04:36.541 --> 04:38.791
and I really think that
we need to acknowledge
that, all right?

04:38.874 --> 04:40.999
-Psycho: That's enough!
-Hawk: All right, guys. Later.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.416
Did I come on too strong?

04:42.500 --> 04:43.999
It was a little
heavy-handed, but it's fine.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.208
Heavy-handed,
what's that mean?

04:45.291 --> 04:46.500

-Uh-huh.

-Yeah.
-I know you're smart.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.749
-Yeah. I am.
-I can't believe
I'm dating a wolf.

04:52.832 --> 04:55.791
I can't believe

04:55.874 --> 04:57.249

thank you so much.

04:58.707 --> 05:00.999
I feel pretty lucky, myself.
I mean, you know.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.083

-That's right.

05:10.124 --> 05:11.666
You know what? Hey.
I'm gonna go fly around

05:11.749 --> 05:13.832
and scout some
weak security points.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.083
-Yeah.
-No, that's perfect.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.500

have eyes like a...

05:17.583 --> 05:19.166
Have eyes like a what?

05:19.249 --> 05:20.666
-Forget it.
-Eyes like Steve Buscemi.

05:20.749 --> 05:22.458

like a hawk, Hawk.

05:28.874 --> 05:29.916

05:30.916 --> 05:33.375
-Okay, so this is beer.
-Okay.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.957
You're just gonna
take a little sip

05:35.041 --> 05:36.458
and you just drank
the whole thing.

05:36.541 --> 05:39.999
What is this witch's brew
that's cast a spell on me?

05:47.458 --> 05:48.874
All right, let's
take it easy, buddy.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.874
I just wanna kiss
your sweet little paw.

05:50.957 --> 05:53.041
Sherman, you gotta ask me
if you can kiss my paw.

05:53.124 --> 05:55.375
You know, people cut these off,
keep them on key chains.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.208
Give it.
Give it up.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.333

Two for the VIP, please.

Yeah. We didn't
wanna say it

08:05.916 --> 08:07.416
'cause we didn't wanna
embarrass you.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.666
We've already got
some Amish royalty in there.

08:09.749 --> 08:11.500
-We're maxed out.
-(laughing)

08:11.583 --> 08:13.166
I'm so wasted!

08:13.249 --> 08:15.166
Put your boobies
in my face again!

08:15.249 --> 08:16.166
That's Bishop Thrustle.

08:16.249 --> 08:17.291
-You know that guy?
-Yeah.

08:17.375 --> 08:18.874
-Weird.
-He is closest to God.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.291
Well, he's definitely close
to them titties, right now.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.916
Okay, you know what?
You, not you.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.041
Okay, so she's cool.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.666
I'm not cool
is what you're saying.

08:25.749 --> 08:27.375
-This is the whole package.
This is the whole look.
-Yeah.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.083
-This is VIP material.
-Right, right.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.707
-What I'm looking at, here...
-No, I actually

08:30.791 --> 08:32.625
exactly understand
his thought process.

08:32.707 --> 08:33.874
I'm gonna go in,

08:33.957 --> 08:35.333
scope it out,
I'll be back in five minutes.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.707
All right?
Just wait here for me.

08:36.791 --> 08:37.791
Have fun, Annie!

08:37.874 --> 08:39.208
Yeah, fuck, yeah!

08:39.291 --> 08:42.124
VIP!
Where the Cristal at?

08:43.041 --> 08:45.124
-(crowd booing)
-Farts on my dead dad!

08:45.208 --> 08:46.874
The next act
is stuck in traffic.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.541
-Shit. Fuck.
-Dude, and they were a big get.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.166
They were huge
and they're big animals.

08:50.249 --> 08:51.707
Physically big animals.
What are we gonna do?

08:51.791 --> 08:53.375
We gotta stall for time,
or something.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.166
And I don't
wanna go out there.

08:55.249 --> 08:57.083
Okay, well, I don't
wanna go out there.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.208
-Hey, Tim!
-Tim!

08:58.291 --> 08:59.707
-How's it going, dude?
-Hey, dude!

08:59.791 --> 09:01.458
So we got a real big security
issue on stage right now.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.999
I don't know if you could tell,
but there's nobody up there.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.249
So, we just need you...
You're a standup
comedian, right?

09:06.333 --> 09:07.707
-I'm not.
-You're hilarious.

09:07.791 --> 09:09.124
Just go out there
and let one rip.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.416
Get out there, buddy!
Good boy, good boy.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.541
Tim (clears throat):
Okay.

09:13.625 --> 09:17.249
Hi, I'm, uh...
My name is Tim.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.791
I'm doing security here.

09:18.874 --> 09:20.124
And, uh...

09:20.208 --> 09:21.458
here goes the comedy.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.166
(clears throat)

09:24.249 --> 09:26.083
You guys like Frisbees?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.791
What's up with those things?

09:27.874 --> 09:29.416
(crowd laughing)

09:29.500 --> 09:32.083
This is... This is going
surprisingly well.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.625
I'm not gonna lie.
What else?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.625
-Burger King Kids Club,
remember that?
-(crowd laughs)

09:35.707 --> 09:38.041
Wheels?
They named him Wheels.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.458
-That was crazy.
-(crowd laughing)

09:39.541 --> 09:41.749
I did not think
I had this kind of set ready.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.291
But I'm clearly killing it.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.666
(Psycho grunts)

09:45.916 --> 09:47.666
Hey, boss.
How's it going?

09:47.749 --> 09:48.957
You try that
veggie patty truck?

09:49.041 --> 09:50.416
It tastes like actual meat!

09:50.500 --> 09:51.458
So good!

09:51.541 --> 09:53.749
Why am I,
the leader of the gang,

09:53.832 --> 09:55.041
and also a wolf,

09:55.124 --> 09:56.957
the one climbing
up the scaffolding

09:57.041 --> 10:00.124
to place our ominous
devices everywhere?

10:00.208 --> 10:02.500
Well, you said, like, me
and the rest of the gang

10:02.583 --> 10:03.791
should have fun till sundown.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.333
It's kind of, like,
magic hour right now.

10:05.416 --> 10:06.791
-So we all went out...
-Okay, you can fly

10:06.874 --> 10:09.500
and I am just so sweaty
in my leather jacket...

10:09.583 --> 10:10.791
I'm sorry,
I'm getting cranky.

10:10.874 --> 10:12.500
I'm just... I'm just
a little nervous

10:12.583 --> 10:13.832
for our big performance.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.083
Hey, Psych.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.208
We practiced,
like, two times.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.583
You've got this in the bag.

10:18.666 --> 10:19.957
We should've rehearsed more.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.083
Listen, I may be just
a dental hygienist from Paramus,

10:23.166 --> 10:25.583
but I know a star
when I see one.

10:25.707 --> 10:27.832
And, Psych,
you are awfully bright.

10:27.916 --> 10:30.416
Hey, excuse me.
Can I have a kiss?

10:30.500 --> 10:33.666
Goddamnit, Hawk.
You're always so damn sweet.

10:33.749 --> 10:34.916
Get over here!

10:36.166 --> 10:39.124
And also, I thought
you were a school teacher
for dumb horses.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.249
All right,
gotta go, honey!

10:41.333 --> 10:43.583
And... done.

10:43.666 --> 10:47.249
-Let the countdown begin.
-(chuckles sinisterly)

10:48.500 --> 10:50.249
All right,
this is going great.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.832
Mike:
Everybody, let's
give it up for Tim, huh?

10:51.916 --> 10:54.041
-Tim: All right.
-Phil: Give it up
for Tim, everybody!

10:54.124 --> 10:56.583
Annie?
Annie?

10:56.666 --> 10:59.541
(sobs) I can't
even see anything!

10:59.625 --> 11:00.832
Check it out,
someone's coming out!

11:00.916 --> 11:04.416
Curse you, Annie,
for leaving me here alone!

11:04.500 --> 11:06.999
Annie:
Hey, can I grab
this mic from you...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.583
Gotcha, gotcha.
What are you gonna do now?

11:08.666 --> 11:10.375
You gonna run?
You gonna run?

11:10.458 --> 11:11.666
I got you.

11:11.749 --> 11:13.166

11:56.999 --> 11:58.957

-(cheering)
-Oh, my God!

12:08.707 --> 12:11.749
-Annie!
-Yeah, that was
pretty sick, right?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.458
What happened?

12:13.541 --> 12:16.333
Yeah, you know, I figured
I'd make your first concert
something memorable.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.208
'Cause you are
VIP to me.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.541
Plus those rats

12:19.625 --> 12:22.874
do not know how to run
a music festival, like, at all.

12:22.957 --> 12:24.916
I should not have
gotten up here this easy.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.083
Everybody!
I had an epiphany.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.458
I am gonna extend
my Rumspringa indefinitely.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.249
You hear that,
Bishop Thrustle?

12:32.333 --> 12:35.375
I'm out, baby!
I am gone, you sick fuck!

12:35.458 --> 12:36.583
-Peace!
-Aah!

12:36.666 --> 12:38.124
Remember when
you got drunk

12:38.208 --> 12:40.666
and kissed my hand
and called me baby?

12:40.749 --> 12:42.999
-Yeah, baby.
-You wanna kiss my face?

12:43.083 --> 12:44.749
Crowd (chanting):
Sherman! Sherman!

12:44.832 --> 12:48.291
The time is nigh,
my Wayword Sons.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.832
Yeah!
The time is night!

12:49.916 --> 12:52.041
-Oh, my God.
I'm so nervous.
-You're great.

12:52.124 --> 12:54.500
-You're gonna do fine.
-It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.208
There is no going back.

12:56.291 --> 12:57.625
-Now!
-(explosion)

12:57.707 --> 12:59.625
(screaming)

12:59.707 --> 13:01.625
(electronic voice):
All righty, then!

13:01.707 --> 13:03.124
Smokin'!

13:03.208 --> 13:04.666
I can't lie to my so!

13:04.749 --> 13:07.124
-Fuck, yeah!
-Yeah!

13:07.208 --> 13:08.333
(Psycho cheering)

13:08.416 --> 13:10.957
-Go, go!
-Jim Carreys everywhere!

13:11.041 --> 13:12.666
Sherman, I know you've
been living under a rock.

13:12.749 --> 13:14.583
There was this
huge trial between...

13:14.666 --> 13:16.333
Yeah, Jim Carrey
versus Adam Sandler.

13:16.416 --> 13:18.291
It's, like, the trial
of the century. I know.

13:19.583 --> 13:21.999
(high-pitched humming)

13:22.083 --> 13:23.249
-What?
-What the fuck happened?

13:23.333 --> 13:25.041
-What's going on?
-I can't understand you!

13:25.124 --> 13:26.249
I can't understand you!

13:26.333 --> 13:27.749
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

13:27.832 --> 13:31.208
-Yo, listen up!
-We have hacked
all grand communicators,

13:31.291 --> 13:33.749
-silencing all
of you like--
-You!

13:33.832 --> 13:36.500
Hold on!
Like we've been silenced.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.832
Who are we?
We are the Wayward Sons

13:39.916 --> 13:41.208
of Carrey!

13:41.291 --> 13:44.208
Carry on,
my Wayward Sons!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.041
Get it?

13:46.749 --> 13:48.791
They're not laughing.
I thought that
would get a big...

13:48.874 --> 13:50.458
No, hey,
it's the house.

13:50.541 --> 13:51.916
It's not you,
I promise.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.707
We're here to protest
the unjust result of the trial.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.541
Jim Carrey
is the superior actor!

13:58.625 --> 14:00.999
Like there was
any doubt!

14:01.083 --> 14:03.916
-Ace Ventura alone!
-This again?

14:03.999 --> 14:05.500
This was already litigated.
I was there!

14:05.583 --> 14:07.416
You guys,
he fucking lost.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.874
Get over it!

14:08.957 --> 14:13.249
Jim Carrey's award show jokes
is a genre in it of itself!

14:13.333 --> 14:17.083
Goddamn genius!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Psych, watch out!

14:17.166 --> 14:20.124
-(barking)
-Guinea Pig:
Motherfucker!

14:20.208 --> 14:22.041
Jim Carrey rules.
He can paint and stuff.

14:22.124 --> 14:23.791
I like that guy.
I like that guy a lot.

14:23.874 --> 14:25.957
-Anyway,
taste my riffs, duck!
-Quack!

14:26.041 --> 14:28.999
Jim Carrey taps into
our universal funny bone.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.458
It is universal.
He is for the people!

14:31.541 --> 14:32.583
I mean, animals!

14:32.666 --> 14:34.707
Annie:
Ace Ventura
does not hold up!

14:34.791 --> 14:36.083
Hawk:
Are you kidding me?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.249
The Mask,
Cameron Diaz?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.333
She is glowing in that!

14:40.416 --> 14:42.832
Well, now it's back to
the state of things, I guess.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.874
Everything's insane.
Chaos reigns, et cetera.

14:44.957 --> 14:46.249
Let's just bring out
the headliner.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.416
Yeah, let's do it.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.957
Did you even see
The Majestic?

14:49.041 --> 14:50.832
It was unfairly maligned.

-Shh, it's okay.
-You were right.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.666
I-I have to admit
something to you.

17:35.749 --> 17:37.874
That you're a flamingo?
Yes, that's pretty
obvious, Hawk.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.749
-But that's okay.
-I'm also bald.

17:39.832 --> 17:41.208
-This is a toupee.
-Mm-hmm.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.375
I also can't speak Japanese.
I was just making up sounds.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.124
-I could tell.
-I'm also a virgin.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.707
I have no idea
how wolves do it,

17:46.791 --> 17:48.832
but I'm pretty sure
us birds just stand
on each other's backs

17:48.916 --> 17:50.749
and dance.
That's why I'm doing that.

17:50.832 --> 17:52.249
Hawk!
It's okay.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.249
-(missile whistling)
-Whoa, whoa.
Wait, what is that noise?

17:54.333 --> 17:55.333
Hawk:
Uh...

17:55.416 --> 17:57.083
This is great.
New standup career.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.416
My whole life
ahead of me.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.166
Ten bucks in my pocket
and what the hell is that?

18:00.249 --> 18:01.749
That's an
approaching nuclear bomb.

18:01.832 --> 18:02.957
Donna Lewis:
Wait, wait!

18:03.041 --> 18:06.041
Stop my amazing song,
look at that!

18:06.124 --> 18:07.458
-Shit.
-Oh, God.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.333
This is the end.
Psycho, quick.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.791
Before I die,
can I dance on your back?

18:11.874 --> 18:14.083
-Uh, okay.
-Yeah!

18:14.166 --> 18:15.791
Yeah, does that feel good?

18:15.874 --> 18:18.124
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, dance on mine.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.166
Is this how you do it?

18:19.249 --> 18:20.500
(both moan)

18:20.583 --> 18:22.124
-They're really sharp.
I love you!
-I love you!

18:22.208 --> 18:24.208
-(whistling)
-It's just like the dinosaurs.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.083
Animals ran
New York City for three years

18:26.166 --> 18:27.625
and it was great,
but looks like everything

18:27.707 --> 18:29.999
comes to an end,
like Dinosaurs,
the TV show.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.625
-Goodbye, old friend.
-No, what?

18:31.707 --> 18:33.083
-Now is the time.
-Now is the time.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.333
Now's the time.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.874
(whooshing)

18:42.041 --> 18:43.458
-Look at that.
-Wow!

18:43.541 --> 18:45.333
-All right, good!
We're not dead!
-That's convenient.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.458
-We're still alive.
-Aah, fuck.

18:47.541 --> 18:48.832
The Orb saved us!

18:48.916 --> 18:51.333
The fucking dirty
GrabBags were right.

18:51.416 --> 18:52.832
The Orb is God!

18:52.916 --> 18:54.375
All hail the Orb!

18:57.874 --> 18:59.625
(coughing)

18:59.707 --> 19:01.208
Is that nuke alive?

19:01.291 --> 19:03.666
Oh, my God.
He's adorable!

19:03.749 --> 19:05.291
-I want kids.
-What?

19:05.375 --> 19:08.625
Aah! Oh, my God!
What the heck! Whoa!

19:08.707 --> 19:10.333
What the shoot!
This is weird.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.500
This feels weird.
This looks weird.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.583
Everything is weird!

19:13.666 --> 19:15.874
What the freaking
Dinosaur Jr.!

19:15.957 --> 19:17.333
(screams)

19:17.416 --> 19:18.874
Receipt:
Hey!

19:18.957 --> 19:21.416
Hey everyone, listen up!
Hey, over here!

19:21.500 --> 19:24.874
The Orb has powers beyond
your recognition, animals.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.874
It created me
and several others like me.

19:27.957 --> 19:30.208
Quick, someone give me
your Grand Communicator

19:30.291 --> 19:31.500
so he can hear us.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.166
What? What's this for?

19:33.249 --> 19:34.208
What are you doing?

19:34.291 --> 19:35.458
Oh, my goodness.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.541
He's hearing
for the first time!

19:37.625 --> 19:39.707
It's like those deaf baby
YouTube videos.

19:39.791 --> 19:41.583
-Instant fucking tears!
-I'm bawling.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.832
Even thinking about
those videos, I'm bawling.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.333
Now, it's in.

19:47.291 --> 19:50.166
Papa? Are you my...
Are you my papa?

19:50.249 --> 19:51.249
Crowd:
Aw!

19:51.333 --> 19:53.541
You wanna go
in the bouncy castle, buddy?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.625
Boy, do I?

19:54.707 --> 19:57.083
Hey, can my name
be Mike?
I wanna be Mike.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.375
Is that cool?
I'm just vibing with Mike.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.208
Really? Of course
you can be Mike, little guy.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.083
Yeah. Nuke Mike.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.458
(Receipt sighs)

20:05.541 --> 20:06.749
I wish I had better news.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.541
I've seen this before.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.583
He's got 24 hours
and then he's gonna

20:10.666 --> 20:13.832
return to his
inanimate state
and explode.

20:13.916 --> 20:15.541
-It's just like Birch!
-He's gonna Birch.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.249
Huh! Did the kid explode
at the end of Simon Birch?

20:18.333 --> 20:19.583
No, but,
you know, he dies.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.375
-Dude!
-Spoilers! Come on!

20:21.458 --> 20:23.957
But Dr. Mouth Move,
what do we do?

20:24.041 --> 20:25.208
Talk to him.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.583
But more specifically,
talk to the GüPrü

20:27.666 --> 20:28.707
attached to his back.

20:28.791 --> 20:30.416
-Nuke: Yeah!
-I did some inspecting

20:30.500 --> 20:33.249
and it seems as though
it's some sort of
live stream

20:33.333 --> 20:35.957
where the humans
were planning on nuking
New York City

20:36.041 --> 20:37.916
and eradicating
all you animals.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.291
Wait, there's still humans?

20:39.375 --> 20:40.957
Hell yeah.
All over!

20:41.041 --> 20:42.333
That sucks.
I thought they died,

20:42.416 --> 20:43.791
like Dinosaurs,
the TV show.

20:43.874 --> 20:45.999
Holy cow!
Donna Lewis?

20:46.083 --> 20:47.957
Hey, Donna!
Big fan, love you!

20:48.041 --> 20:50.083
Listen, when my friends
turned inanimate,

20:50.166 --> 20:51.916
I brought them back
to where we came from.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.541
The Orb. And in my
professional opinion,

20:54.625 --> 20:56.458
I think a similar
course of action

20:56.541 --> 20:57.832
with Nuke
would be prudent.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.458
Send that motherfucker
back to New Jersey.

21:00.541 --> 21:01.874
(crowd applauds)

21:02.333 --> 21:04.083
All right,
and we're live.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.458
Whaddup, humans?
You pieces of shit!

21:06.541 --> 21:07.874
Phil:
Hello, human beings!

21:07.957 --> 21:09.791
First time, long time.
How you guys been, huh?

21:09.874 --> 21:11.458
Bunch of pervy
dudes getting outed

21:11.541 --> 21:12.749
and a bullshit president?

21:12.832 --> 21:14.083
Figures, 'cause you suck!

21:14.166 --> 21:16.583
You tried to destroy
our little animal kingdom.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.541
But guess what?
We already did, motherfucker!

21:18.625 --> 21:20.249
-We did.
-Look at us!
There's no kings, here!

21:20.333 --> 21:21.625
There's no class system, here!

21:21.707 --> 21:23.625
We had a music festival
with a bunch of animals!

21:23.707 --> 21:25.166
-It was so sick!
-It was so sick!

21:25.249 --> 21:27.083
-It's so sick!
-Sure, sure.

21:27.166 --> 21:30.124
It got derailed a little bit
by a Jim Carrey activist group.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.666
-Yeah. That was us!
-Sorry, guys!

21:31.749 --> 21:33.666
All things considered,
it went pretty smoothly.

21:33.749 --> 21:35.500
Yeah, exactly.
We're all friends!

21:35.583 --> 21:37.707
-Fun day.
We had a good time.
-Good time.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.583
You motherfuckers
tried to nuke us?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.083
Well, guess what?
We're gonna eat you.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.874
That's right.
We're gonna eat your kids.

21:42.957 --> 21:44.458
We're gonna eat
your money.

21:44.541 --> 21:45.791
we're gonna eat
your military,

21:45.874 --> 21:47.458
We're gonna bite
your fucking heads off!

21:47.541 --> 21:49.916
Because you drew
first blood, not me!

21:49.999 --> 21:51.999
-They drew first blood!
-They drew first blood!

21:52.083 --> 21:53.291
Both:
They drew first blood!

21:53.375 --> 21:56.166
Boom, baby!
We comin' for ya!
Ha ha!

21:56.249 --> 21:58.957
Sorry, dudes!
It's me, Nuke Mike.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.333
Remember you made me
to destroy all the animals.

22:01.416 --> 22:02.832
Well, now,
I'm on their side

22:02.916 --> 22:04.999
and I also just
learned a new word,

22:12.249 --> 22:13.500
-They're coming this way.
-No.
