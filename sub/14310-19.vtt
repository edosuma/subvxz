WEBVTT

00:05.089 --> 00:08.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.089
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.109 --> 00:15.019
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.230
They were good.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.140
[theme music]

00:22.120 --> 00:26.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.149 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.050
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.039 --> 00:36.159
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.179 --> 00:38.140
[evil laughter]

00:38.159 --> 00:39.149
Unh!

00:39.170 --> 00:41.100
Oh, I'll get you.

00:41.119 --> 00:44.140
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.159 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.200
And if you are good,
you may just

00:53.219 --> 00:56.200
catch a glimpse
of the Smurfs.

01:03.170 --> 01:06.189
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

01:06.209 --> 01:10.159
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

01:10.180 --> 01:13.090
They call themselves Smurfs.

01:13.109 --> 01:15.060
They were good.

01:15.079 --> 01:17.210
[theme music]

01:20.200 --> 01:24.210
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.069
He was bad.

01:26.090 --> 01:28.129
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

01:29.219 --> 01:32.099
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

01:32.120 --> 01:35.000
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

01:35.020 --> 01:36.219
[evil laughter]

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Unh!

01:38.020 --> 01:39.170
Oh, I'll get you.

01:39.189 --> 01:42.210
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

01:42.229 --> 01:45.099
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

01:45.120 --> 01:49.150
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

01:49.170 --> 01:52.039
And if you are good,
you may just

01:52.060 --> 01:55.030
catch a glimpse
of the Smurfs.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.019
[theme music]

02:03.200 --> 02:05.189
[theme music]

02:15.030 --> 02:17.110
[roaring in distance]

02:24.159 --> 02:26.219
[bird squawks]

02:27.000 --> 02:28.069
[squeals]

02:34.229 --> 02:36.229
[roaring]

02:45.060 --> 02:47.060
And the great knights
of the Round Table

02:47.079 --> 02:49.219
were the most virtuous
and courageous of all.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.120
In fact,
I wrote "An Ode to a Knight."

02:52.139 --> 02:53.219
[clears throat]

02:54.000 --> 02:58.120
"O knight so bold
in the night so cold what is--"

02:58.139 --> 03:00.120
I could've been
the greatest knight of all

03:00.139 --> 03:01.229
if I wasn't a Smurf.

03:02.009 --> 03:04.050
What's wrong with being a Smurf?

03:04.069 --> 03:07.199
Oh, nothing. But have you ever
seen a Smurf knight?

03:07.219 --> 03:11.020
I hate knights. And days.

03:11.039 --> 03:13.129
There's no maiden
I couldn't rescue.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.210
No dragon I couldn't slay. No--

03:15.229 --> 03:18.079
Oh, look!

03:18.099 --> 03:20.180
(Greedy)
'The bridge
over the River Smurf.'

03:20.199 --> 03:22.000
Come on!

03:22.020 --> 03:23.219
I hate fires.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.020
I'll, uh, tell Papa Smurf.

03:32.110 --> 03:34.189
[all clamoring]

03:39.210 --> 03:42.120
Smurf some more water
on that tree, Hefty.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.229
Clumsy, it's flaming up
on your left.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.030
Uh, my left?

03:49.050 --> 03:52.009
The left, Clumsy, the left.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.110
Uh, oh!

03:54.129 --> 03:56.039
Not funny, Clumsy.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.090
- Faster, faster!
- We need more water.

03:59.110 --> 04:00.150
(Vanity)
Smurf it up, Brainy.

04:00.169 --> 04:01.229
(Grouchy)
I hate fire.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.219
[all clamoring]

04:31.060 --> 04:35.100
Ah! Boy, that was some fire.
I'm so tired, I could go to..

04:35.120 --> 04:36.180
[snores]

04:38.069 --> 04:41.120
How did that terrible fire
start, Papa Smurf?

04:41.139 --> 04:43.040
I don't know, Smurfette.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.110
I'm just glad
it didn't reach the village.

04:45.129 --> 04:46.180
[bell ringing]

04:46.199 --> 04:50.060
- That's the fire alarm.
- The village, quickly.

04:50.079 --> 04:52.199
Handy, Hefty,
get the fire truck.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.209
The rest, form a line
from the well.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.149
Oh, uh, gee. Uh..

05:02.170 --> 05:05.209
Thank you, Clumsy,
for putting out my beard.

05:05.230 --> 05:09.129
Huh? Oh, uh, right.
Anytime, Papa Smurf.

05:09.149 --> 05:10.230
[explosion nearby]

05:11.009 --> 05:13.220
(Papa)
'All my chemicals, my books.'

05:14.000 --> 05:15.209
(Hefty)
'Look out, Papa Smurf!'

05:24.029 --> 05:27.009
(Handy)
What in smurf's name
started these fires?

05:27.029 --> 05:28.129
Well, whoever it was

05:28.149 --> 05:30.180
I'd like to teach them
a few things. I'd like to--

05:30.199 --> 05:34.120
(Brainy)
Papa Smurf.
Papa Smurf, come quick.

05:34.139 --> 05:37.220
Look what I found.
What kind are they?

05:39.230 --> 05:42.019
These are the footprints
of a dragon.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.019
(all)
A dragon?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.079
And it could return any time.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.060
We must have
an emergency meeting.

05:49.079 --> 05:52.120
These books are all I saved
from my laboratory.

05:52.139 --> 05:54.110
And without my potions
and formulas

05:54.129 --> 05:57.060
our village has little
protection from the dragon.

05:57.079 --> 06:01.009
'So we must start building
our new armament now.'

06:01.029 --> 06:04.129
What we really need is a knight
to protect us, Papa Smurf.

06:04.149 --> 06:07.019
Yes, Poet. But I don't know
of any knights

06:07.040 --> 06:08.220
that would protect a Smurf.

06:09.189 --> 06:11.149
[whispering indistinctly]

06:11.170 --> 06:13.139
Are you serious, Hefty?

06:13.160 --> 06:15.180
Absosmurfly.

06:18.089 --> 06:20.199
Would someone tell me
what we're waiting for?

06:20.220 --> 06:23.149
I'm missing my beauty sleep.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.189
[yawns]
Did some Smurf say..

06:25.209 --> 06:28.129
[snoring]

06:28.149 --> 06:30.100
I hate waiting.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.170
Hefty just said to be here,
and that it was important.

06:35.090 --> 06:38.029
[playing off-key]

06:38.050 --> 06:44.149
Lady and gentlesmurfs,
may I present Sir Hefty.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.170
[all gasp]

06:45.189 --> 06:48.120
Hefty, what are you doing?

06:49.110 --> 06:52.110
I am going to slay the dragon.

06:52.129 --> 06:55.220
(all)
Slay the dragon?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.170
Slay the dragon?

06:57.189 --> 07:00.230
Hefty, have you gone stark
raving smurf?

07:01.009 --> 07:04.100
You're no match
for a big, nasty old dragon.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.120
Ha! You mean
he's no match for me.

07:07.139 --> 07:08.199
[laughs]

07:08.220 --> 07:11.199
This is a joke. Right, Hefty?
Tell me it's a..

07:11.220 --> 07:13.000
[laughs]

07:13.019 --> 07:14.100
A joke.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.199
It's no joke. I'm going to save
the village from the dragon.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.199
(Smurfette)
'Be careful, Hefty.'

07:20.220 --> 07:23.230
(all)
'Bye, Hefty. Good luck.'

07:24.009 --> 07:27.050
And remember,
don't tell Papa Smurf.

07:27.069 --> 07:29.110
(all)
'We promise, Hefty.'

07:35.050 --> 07:36.050
Hmm.

07:36.069 --> 07:38.079
Now, how do I find the dragon?

07:38.100 --> 07:41.079
He probably heard I was coming
and it scared him off.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.189
[dragon roaring in distance]

07:43.209 --> 07:46.209
Then again, maybe he didn't hear
I was coming.

07:46.230 --> 07:51.040
[stammers]
Look out, Mr. Dragon,
here comes Hefty.

07:53.189 --> 07:57.090
Alright, Hefty, let's see
how brave you really are.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.189
[gasping]

08:02.160 --> 08:04.139
[roaring]

08:09.019 --> 08:10.079
Yee-ow!

08:12.129 --> 08:13.160
Yee-ow!

08:14.149 --> 08:17.029
[roaring]

08:19.139 --> 08:22.120
Smurf up to it, Hefty.
You're only a little Smurf.

08:22.139 --> 08:25.139
A three-apples-high,
blue-faced Smurf.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.199
You'll never be a real knight.

08:28.220 --> 08:32.139
When I get back to the village,
all the Smurfs are gonna laugh.

08:32.159 --> 08:36.149
O smurf is me! What'll I do?
[horse neighs nearby]

08:36.169 --> 08:39.000
What's that?

08:39.019 --> 08:43.120
A knight. A real knight.

08:43.139 --> 08:46.009
[Hefty coughing]

08:46.029 --> 08:48.070
[Hefty sneezes]

08:48.090 --> 08:50.220
I wonder if he would
protect a Smurf.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.029
There's only one way
to find out.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.029
[hoofbeats nearby]

09:00.029 --> 09:04.049
They still be after me.
A hideout is what I need.

09:06.049 --> 09:07.120
[panting]

09:09.019 --> 09:12.090
Not even enough
to buy meself a meat pie.

09:12.110 --> 09:17.179
Ah, what I wouldn't give for
a good meal and a bit of grog.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.009
(Hefty)
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Knight.

09:20.029 --> 09:22.090
Who's there? Show yourself.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.149
Uh, me, Hefty Smurf.

09:24.169 --> 09:27.190
Blimey, a talking mouse.

09:27.210 --> 09:30.120
I'm not a mouse, I'm a Smurf.

09:30.139 --> 09:34.070
A Smurf? Uh, are you alone?

09:34.090 --> 09:35.220
(Hefty)
'Yes, sir.'

09:36.000 --> 09:37.059
Good.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.220
[clatter]

09:40.000 --> 09:41.230
Are you a real knight?

09:42.009 --> 09:47.039
Of course. I'm Sir Lancelout
of the king's Round Table.

09:47.059 --> 09:50.049
A knight of the Round Table?

09:50.070 --> 09:52.139
The very same.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.009
Oh, um..

09:54.029 --> 09:56.139
Then you probably
wouldn't be interested in a job.

09:56.159 --> 10:00.019
What kind of a job,
my little friend?

10:00.039 --> 10:04.159
- Protecting my village.
- Is your village well hidden?

10:04.179 --> 10:08.049
Oh, yes, sir. No one can find
our village.

10:08.070 --> 10:11.090
Uh, uh, what of food and drink?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.200
All you want.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.159
[laughs]
Then I accept.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.139
Oh, thank you,
Sir Lancelout. Thank you.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
[snoring]

10:25.019 --> 10:27.139
Lazy, hasn't Papa Smurf
told you..

10:27.159 --> 10:29.120
[horse whinnies]

10:29.139 --> 10:32.200
[Smurfette gasps]
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

10:35.000 --> 10:40.220
Smurfs, this is Sir Lancelout,
knight of the Round Table.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.009
[all exclaiming]

10:43.029 --> 10:46.059
And he's going to protect
our village from the dragon.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.210
(all)
'Hooray!'

10:47.230 --> 10:51.179
Dragon?
You never mentioned a dragon.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.049
Oh, you know

10:53.070 --> 10:55.230
he's just one of the ordinary,
fire-breathing kind.

10:56.009 --> 10:58.110
'No problem for you,
Sir Lancelout.'

10:58.129 --> 11:00.129
[Smurfs cheer]

11:00.149 --> 11:05.230
Ah, Papa Smurf,
isn't he absosmurfly wonderful?

11:06.009 --> 11:07.070
Mm.

11:08.159 --> 11:11.149
[humming]

11:11.169 --> 11:13.200
Hi, Greedy. What are you making?

11:13.220 --> 11:17.000
Delicious, mouthwatering cakes,
Smurfette.

11:17.019 --> 11:20.009
Ooh. Could you make one
for little old me?

11:20.029 --> 11:22.190
I want to give one
to Sir Lancelout.

11:22.210 --> 11:26.179
Sorry, Smurfette, but these are
all for Sir Lancelout.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.179
'I think he's the smurfiest.'

11:35.149 --> 11:38.019
Hi, Poet, what you doing?

11:38.039 --> 11:41.120
Creating, Smurfette, creating.

11:41.139 --> 11:44.049
Ooh. Could you do me
a big favor

11:44.070 --> 11:46.220
and write me a poem
for Sir Lancelout?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.039
Oh, no. I'm already
giving him a poem.

11:50.059 --> 11:52.129
It's called
"Ode to the Knight."

12:02.000 --> 12:03.190
How's that, Sir Lancelout?

12:03.210 --> 12:06.070
I'd say that was perfect,
shorty.

12:06.090 --> 12:09.210
Uh, Handy. My name's Handy.
Anything else I can do for you?

12:09.230 --> 12:13.200
Yes. Knock all the dents
out of my armor.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.049
[humming]

12:17.039 --> 12:20.230
Hey, Handy, what in smurf's name
are you doing?

12:21.009 --> 12:23.230
Sir Lancelout wants me
to knock out the dents.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.210
But he wants me to shine it.

12:25.230 --> 12:28.080
Knocking out dents
is more important.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.190
[armor rumbling]

12:29.210 --> 12:33.090
Hey, Handy! Stop! Stop!

12:33.110 --> 12:34.179
[humming]

12:36.190 --> 12:39.220
My cakes! My beautiful cakes!

12:42.080 --> 12:45.019
Actually, old chap
perhaps tomorrow would be

12:45.039 --> 12:47.029
a better day
to hunt the dragon.

12:47.049 --> 12:49.139
I'm tired from my journey.

12:49.159 --> 12:53.000
But that's what you said
yesterday, Sir Lancelout.

12:53.019 --> 12:56.200
[chuckles]
Yes, well, it was
a long journey.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.220
Hmm.

13:02.019 --> 13:05.120
Handy? Hefty?
Where is every Smurf?

13:05.139 --> 13:08.019
Hmm, I'll bet I know
where they are.

13:08.039 --> 13:11.039
Ah, this is the life.

13:18.029 --> 13:20.210
When are you gonna fight
the dragon, Sir Lancelout?

13:20.230 --> 13:22.190
Soon, shorty, soon.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.169
But first I must rest up.

13:24.190 --> 13:28.200
Vanquishing a dragon takes
great strength and courage.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.110
(all)
'Ooh! Aah!'

13:31.129 --> 13:36.039
Something tells me this knight
isn't all he says he is.

13:36.059 --> 13:37.179
Here, Mr. Knight.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.200
[giggling]

13:39.220 --> 13:43.220
- For me? What is it?
- It's a surprise.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.200
[giggles]

13:45.220 --> 13:48.019
(Brainy)
'Sir Lancelout, no!'

13:51.210 --> 13:54.179
My smurfberry surprise.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.230
Heh-heh. Sorry
about that, Jokey.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.179
No Smurf is perfect.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.059
Enough, enough.
I want to sleep now.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.139
I called this secret meeting
because our village

14:13.159 --> 14:16.139
could be attacked again
at any time by the dragon.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.120
But I am here to talk to you
about Sir Lancelout.

14:19.139 --> 14:21.220
I believe he is not
a knight at all

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
but a common thief
and a coward..

14:25.019 --> 14:25.230
Huh?

14:26.009 --> 14:27.029
...who has no intention

14:27.049 --> 14:29.100
of ever fighting the dragon.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.009
[all muttering]

14:32.029 --> 14:35.120
- But, Papa Smurf--
- 'Wait, Hefty, hear me out.'

14:35.139 --> 14:40.139
I have a plan that will tell us
the truth about Sir Lancelout.

14:40.159 --> 14:43.110
'We'll build a fake dragon
to attack the village.'

14:43.129 --> 14:45.220
(Papa)
'And what our so-called
knight does..'

14:46.000 --> 14:47.220
'...will tell us the truth
about him.'

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
'We'll get to work on our plan
first thing in the morning.'

14:51.019 --> 14:52.110
A plan, is it?

14:52.129 --> 14:57.049
Well blimey,
I'll just see about that.

15:00.090 --> 15:04.200
Hefty, how would you like to be
my knight's apprentice?

15:04.220 --> 15:07.200
[stammers]
Knight's apprentice?

15:07.220 --> 15:10.190
Yes. Which means
you must be virtuous

15:10.210 --> 15:14.019
and honorable
and always tell the truth.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.149
Always tell the truth?

15:16.169 --> 15:21.000
(Lancelout)
'Otherwise, you can never
become a knight.'

15:21.019 --> 15:22.000
Oh.

15:22.019 --> 15:23.039
(Handy)
'Alright, Clumsy'

15:23.059 --> 15:24.169
'pull that lever on the right.'

15:24.190 --> 15:26.100
(Clumsy)
'Uh, okay, Handy.'

15:29.159 --> 15:33.169
(Handy)
No, no, Clumsy. The lever
on the right, the right!

15:33.190 --> 15:36.000
Uh, okay, Handy.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.169
That's a smurfy-looking dragon,
Handy.

15:38.190 --> 15:43.019
I'm just testing him now,
Papa Smurf. Any time, Clumsy.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.179
Lazy, let's hear the roar.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.210
[Lazy snores]

15:49.230 --> 15:51.200
Uh, as you can see,
Papa Smurf

15:51.220 --> 15:54.159
I've got some rough spots
to iron out.

15:54.179 --> 15:57.039
But it'll be ready to go
this afternoon.

15:57.059 --> 15:58.179
Very good, Handy.

16:07.070 --> 16:11.019
Well, if that dragon ever
shows up again, we'll be ready.

16:11.039 --> 16:14.149
With or without Sir Lancelout.

16:14.169 --> 16:16.210
I don't know
what I'm gonna do, Smurfette.

16:16.230 --> 16:19.139
Papa Smurf said to keep
the fake dragon a secret.

16:19.159 --> 16:23.129
But now that I'm a knight's
apprentice, I feel like, uh..

16:23.149 --> 16:26.169
- You should tell Sir Lancelout?
- Yeah.

16:26.190 --> 16:30.029
Hefty, you have to do
what Papa Smurf says.

16:30.049 --> 16:31.179
Papa knows best.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.080
Yeah, I guess you're right.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.159
[moans]

16:39.190 --> 16:42.059
That's the way, Hefty. Ha ha.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.090
You'll make a chipper
of a knight.

16:44.110 --> 16:48.080
You're brave, honorable,
you always tell the truth.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.019
No, I don't, Sir Lancelout.

16:50.039 --> 16:52.190
(Lancelout)
Oh? Um..

16:52.210 --> 16:57.019
It's a secret. I can't tell you
about the fake dragon.

16:57.039 --> 16:59.070
(Lancelout)
A fake dragon, eh?

16:59.090 --> 17:03.200
So they're putting me
to a little test, huh?

17:03.220 --> 17:08.118
Uh, don't worry, Hefty.
I'll pass with flying colors.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.098
[Lancelout chuckling]

17:13.200 --> 17:15.180
(Lancelout)
'Egad, hurry it up, Hefty.'

17:15.200 --> 17:17.180
'I've got a dragon to slay.'

17:17.200 --> 17:20.049
[Lancelout laughing]

17:20.069 --> 17:21.049
[grunts]

17:21.069 --> 17:22.140
Here, Sir Lancelout.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.230
[panting]

17:25.089 --> 17:29.069
I'm ready. Bring on
the bloody dragon.

17:29.089 --> 17:32.029
You're not gonna hurt it,
are you Sir Lancelout?

17:32.049 --> 17:36.059
Hurt it? Of course not. I just
want to scare it a little.

17:36.079 --> 17:38.029
[to himself]
And teach them a lesson.

17:38.049 --> 17:39.220
[laughing]

17:44.089 --> 17:46.069
[whistling]

17:46.089 --> 17:49.019
They're ready. Brainy,
you're on.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.200
Don't worry, Papa Smurf,
I won't let you down.

17:51.220 --> 17:56.049
You can always count on me,
Papa Smurf. I always say--

17:56.069 --> 18:00.059
- Go, Brainy.
- Yes, Papa Smurf.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.109
Smurfette, tell the others
to get ready

18:02.130 --> 18:04.140
'and listen
for the alarm bell.'

18:04.160 --> 18:06.049
Yes, Papa Smurf.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.009
I hope I'm right.

18:09.029 --> 18:10.059
[snoring]

18:10.079 --> 18:12.119
(Brainy)
'Sir Lancelout! Sir Lancelout!'

18:12.140 --> 18:16.099
- 'The dragon's coming!'
- Huh? What?

18:16.119 --> 18:19.000
The-the dragon.
The-the dragon.

18:19.019 --> 18:21.000
You've gotta save us,
Sir Lancelout.

18:21.019 --> 18:25.039
Oh, it's a disaster.
Oh, it's terrible.

18:25.059 --> 18:28.150
But of course I will.

18:28.170 --> 18:31.210
You will? I mean,
"Oh, you will."

18:31.230 --> 18:35.039
Hefty, my sword.

18:35.059 --> 18:36.140
(Hefty)
Whoa!

18:36.160 --> 18:37.130
[Hefty panting]

18:37.150 --> 18:39.180
Wait here, my little friends

18:39.200 --> 18:43.000
whilst I slay
this dastardly dragon.

18:43.019 --> 18:46.210
Hey, maybe he really is
a knight of the Round Table.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.059
Not maybe, he is.

18:49.079 --> 18:51.039
(Handy)
'Turn right, Clumsy.'

18:51.059 --> 18:53.029
(Clumsy)
'Uh, right, Handy.'

18:54.119 --> 18:56.200
(Handy)
'Right, Clumsy, right.'

18:56.220 --> 18:59.089
(Clumsy)
'Uh, yeah, right. Hah-ha!'

18:59.109 --> 19:01.200
(Handy)
'Lazy, get ready to roar.'

19:01.220 --> 19:04.009
[Lazy snoring]

19:04.029 --> 19:05.190
(Handy)
'Lazy!'

19:05.210 --> 19:08.019
(Lazy)
'Wha.. Oh, uh, yeah.'

19:08.039 --> 19:10.089
[Lazy roars]

19:10.109 --> 19:13.029
(Handy)
'Is the fire breath ready,
Greedy?'

19:13.049 --> 19:15.130
(Greedy)
'No problem. Watch this.'

19:18.069 --> 19:20.190
[roars]

19:20.210 --> 19:23.039
(Handy)
'Good roar, Lazy.'

19:23.059 --> 19:24.220
(Lazy)
'Roar?'

19:25.000 --> 19:26.190
(Handy)
'What are we stopping for?'

19:26.210 --> 19:30.069
We bumped into
a big scaly tree.

19:30.089 --> 19:33.069
(all)
'Scaly tree?'

19:33.089 --> 19:36.200
(Lazy)
'Uh, better make that
a big scaly dragon.'

19:36.220 --> 19:38.049
[roaring]

19:40.039 --> 19:42.059
(all)
'Let's smurf out of here!'

19:46.160 --> 19:47.220
[snorts]

19:49.119 --> 19:52.049
[roaring nearby]

19:52.069 --> 19:54.099
Here they come. Get ready.

19:54.119 --> 19:57.109
Ah, I look perfect.

19:57.130 --> 20:00.079
[roaring]

20:00.099 --> 20:03.220
Alright, my little Smurfs.
You know what to do.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.059
Make it look real.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.069
(Jokey)
It's the dragon.

20:07.089 --> 20:10.029
(Poet)
Help! Help! The dragon's coming.

20:10.049 --> 20:11.210
(Vanity)
Smurf for your lives.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.170
(Grouchy)
I hate dragons.

20:13.190 --> 20:16.089
[all screaming]

20:16.109 --> 20:18.140
No, no, the dragon..

20:18.160 --> 20:22.170
Oh, please, spare me,
great scaly beast.

20:22.190 --> 20:24.200
Let's not overdo it, Vanity.

20:24.220 --> 20:27.190
Come on, you miserable lizard.

20:27.210 --> 20:30.049
You've finally met your match.

20:30.069 --> 20:34.200
Am I wrong? Impossible.
I'm hardly ever wrong.

20:34.220 --> 20:36.049
[roaring]

20:39.119 --> 20:41.180
Watch where
you're smurfing, Handy.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.150
Handy, is that you?

20:45.170 --> 20:48.170
Papa Smurf,
that's the real dragon.

20:48.190 --> 20:51.000
I must warn my Smurfs.

20:51.019 --> 20:52.099
[all screaming]

20:54.039 --> 20:57.160
Run, my little Smurfs.
That dragon is real.

20:57.180 --> 20:58.190
(all)
Real?

20:58.210 --> 21:01.160
[dragon roaring]

21:01.180 --> 21:04.049
Smurf for your lives!

21:04.069 --> 21:05.200
(Greedy)
The dragon's real?

21:05.220 --> 21:07.099
(Clumsy)
Ah! Let me out of here.

21:07.119 --> 21:12.039
Hefty! The dragon, it's real!
Papa Smurf said.

21:12.059 --> 21:15.210
Oh, no! Sir Lancelout thinks
it's a fake.

21:15.230 --> 21:19.150
Come and meet your master,
miserable beast.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.200
Sir Lancelout, the dragon's
not a fake, it's real.

21:25.220 --> 21:28.039
Real? Do you mean..

21:30.039 --> 21:32.079
(Hefty)
Look out!

21:32.099 --> 21:34.079
Real?

21:34.099 --> 21:37.180
Blimey, let me out of here!

21:37.200 --> 21:40.130
(Hefty)
'He-he really isn't a knight.'

21:40.150 --> 21:43.119
He's nothing but a-a coward.

21:43.140 --> 21:45.180
(Smurfette)
'Hefty, look out!'

21:52.109 --> 21:54.009
[screams]

21:54.029 --> 21:57.019
Don't worry, Smurfette,
I'll protect you.

21:58.190 --> 22:01.170
Oh, Hefty, be careful.

22:03.109 --> 22:06.170
Ready, aim, fire!

22:11.130 --> 22:13.059
[roars]

22:17.220 --> 22:19.039
[roars]

22:20.009 --> 22:21.089
[giggles]

22:21.109 --> 22:24.180
Here, Mr. Dragon.
It's a surprise.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.180
[giggles]

22:28.220 --> 22:31.130
[roaring]

22:38.099 --> 22:40.009
I've gotta get him
outta the village

22:40.029 --> 22:43.029
or he'll destroy
the whole place.

22:46.160 --> 22:50.140
You're nothing but a big pile
of scales, dragon.

22:51.029 --> 22:53.019
[roars]

22:53.039 --> 22:55.109
Smurf me if you can.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.069
Smurfette, tell Papa Smurf
to open the dam

22:58.089 --> 23:01.029
when I reach the bridge.

23:01.049 --> 23:03.029
Okay, Hefty.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.150
This is the end of the line,
big fella.

23:05.170 --> 23:08.000
Time for you to cool off.

23:11.009 --> 23:12.130
[whistles]

23:23.230 --> 23:27.130
(Smurfette)
Oh, boo-hoo! Poor Hefty.

23:27.150 --> 23:30.109
He sacrificed himself for us.

23:30.130 --> 23:33.119
He was a brave Smurf.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.160
[all crying]

23:38.210 --> 23:40.059
[sneeze nearby]

23:41.200 --> 23:43.049
(all)
'Hefty!'

23:43.069 --> 23:45.170
- What happened?
- We thought you were dead.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.059
[all chattering]

23:48.079 --> 23:49.150
[sneezes]

23:51.049 --> 23:56.130
I dub thee Sir Hefty,
knight of the Smurf Table.

23:56.150 --> 23:58.119
Three cheers for Hefty.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.089
- Hip, hip..
- Hooray!

24:00.109 --> 24:02.049
- Hip, hip..
- Hooray!

24:02.069 --> 24:04.140
- Hip, hip..
- Hooray!
