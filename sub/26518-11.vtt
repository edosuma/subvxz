00:00.900 --> 00:05.130
(phone ringing)9-1-1, what's your emergency?

00:05.330 --> 00:08.620
(man)
There's someone trying
to break into my house.

00:08.620 --> 00:09.330
I think it's--

00:09.330 --> 00:10.700
I think they're after my--
(glass breaking)

00:10.700 --> 00:13.370
They're in the house.Who is in the house, sir?

00:13.370 --> 00:16.580
No!
Hello, can you please send--

00:16.580 --> 00:19.990
Hello!
I've gotta get out of here.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.660
You?!

00:34.830 --> 00:36.200
Late night?
(sighs)

00:36.200 --> 00:39.200
Just catching up on all
this undercover work

00:39.200 --> 00:40.740
Zapata had with Keaton.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.030
Still can't believe she's back.

00:43.030 --> 00:46.910
I still can't believe
that she kept us in
the dark about their op.

00:46.910 --> 00:48.200
On paper, I almost get it.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.780
They felt like they
couldn't take any chances.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.910
Yeah, but in reality...

00:53.910 --> 00:57.950
I feel completely betrayed
and backed into a corner.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.780
Now I got no choice
but to send Zapata back

00:59.780 --> 01:01.870
out on a mission
I never even authorized,

01:01.870 --> 01:03.530
all while keeping
the CIA off her back.

01:03.530 --> 01:08.330
Yeah, but, just remember.
She wasn't calling the shots.

01:08.330 --> 01:09.120
Keaton was.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.830
And with him still in a coma,
this is all on you now.

01:12.830 --> 01:14.120
This must be how
Phil Jackson felt

01:14.120 --> 01:17.910
when he was brought in
to turn the Knicks around.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.870
He got fired, didn't he?

01:20.870 --> 01:22.080
Don't remind me.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.830
(laughing)
Sorry.

01:23.830 --> 01:26.030
How's Jane doing?

01:26.030 --> 01:27.830
She's good.

01:27.830 --> 01:28.950
She's really good...

01:28.950 --> 01:31.450
considering everything
she's going through.

01:31.450 --> 01:33.370
The doctors,
they keep telling me

01:33.370 --> 01:34.870
I gotta give her
breathing room

01:34.870 --> 01:40.080
so she can figure out
what her "new normal" is.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.990
I would love me some
"normal" right about now.

01:42.990 --> 01:43.530
Same.

01:43.530 --> 01:47.280
Zapata's supposed to be meeting
with Del Toro right this second.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.280
Natasha...
(shrieks)

01:49.280 --> 01:51.660
The CIA would like a word.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.700
You don't seem too worried
that she's meeting up

01:53.700 --> 01:56.160
with a dangerous
cartel hacker.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.660
(car tires screeching)

01:59.660 --> 02:01.410
(banging)

02:01.410 --> 02:02.580
(tires skid)

02:02.580 --> 02:05.700
If I've learned one thing,
it's that Zapata

02:05.700 --> 02:09.450
has no problem
taking care of herself.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.530
Hey, listen,
you don't understand.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.160
Unh!

02:20.410 --> 02:22.240
(Patterson)
The ZIP you were
injected with

02:22.240 --> 02:24.490
has never fully
left your system.

02:24.490 --> 02:26.990
It's killing you.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.780
(Shepherd)
If this Kallisto person
is still out there

02:29.780 --> 02:33.740
he might have a way
to reverse the effects of ZIP.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.870
It's too late.

02:43.410 --> 02:43.990
Whoa...

02:43.990 --> 02:46.990
Was it something
he said?
(sighs)

02:46.990 --> 02:48.740
Kind of.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.120
It's weird.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.450
When I first
came out of that bag

02:51.450 --> 02:54.160
and discovered
all the things
I could do, the...

02:54.160 --> 02:57.080
fighting styles,
the languages--

02:57.080 --> 02:59.830
The helicopter flying?
Hm.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.740
It was all muscle
memory, instinct.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.410
But now?

03:03.410 --> 03:06.080
Every hit brings a rush
of memories of every hit

03:06.080 --> 03:10.160
before it, every workout,
every lesson, it's, uh...

03:10.160 --> 03:12.240
Overwhelming?

03:12.240 --> 03:12.990
A little, yeah.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.870
But I'd take Remi's
training memories over...

03:16.870 --> 03:19.950
almost everything
else she did.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.410
Well, speaking of your...

03:22.410 --> 03:23.530
health situation.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.240
Please tell me that
contains the stem cells

03:25.240 --> 03:28.330
that are gonna
save my life.
Not quite.

03:28.330 --> 03:32.240
But this is...
A bracelet.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.410
I was going to say

03:34.410 --> 03:38.370
this is a "custom-designed
ultra-smart health monitor."

03:38.370 --> 03:40.450
But, sure, "bracelet"
works, too.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.160
Okay.
Dr. Roga identified

03:43.160 --> 03:45.280
a dozen key
indicators associated

03:45.280 --> 03:47.620
with the progression
of ZIP poisoning.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.490
This tracks all of them.

03:48.490 --> 03:53.410
Everything from heart rhythms
to oxygen saturation.

03:53.410 --> 03:55.530
It even analyzes
the content of your sweat.

03:55.530 --> 04:00.910
So, uh, it monitors how close
I'm moving towards death.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.620
That's a little dark.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.870
Don't think
of it like that.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.120
Think of it like
it's your own

04:06.120 --> 04:07.910
personal Patterson
with you at all times.

04:07.910 --> 04:11.370
And that green light is
basically me waving at you,

04:11.370 --> 04:14.620
saying, "Hi, hello,
everything's fine."

04:14.620 --> 04:16.200
Thank you.
You're welcome.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.950
Okay, now you have to
teach me that combo move.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.990
(chuckles)
Okay.
(chuckles)

04:21.990 --> 04:24.740
All right.
Thank you.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.780
Edgar! Hey...
Ooh!

04:27.780 --> 04:29.620
Jeez, I did not see you there.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.740
Sorry, Rich.
You're saying "sorry"

04:30.740 --> 04:32.280
and yet I feel like
you're kind of blaming me

04:32.280 --> 04:35.410
for what just happened--
Briana, thanks.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.700
Where's the fire, Rich?

04:36.700 --> 04:37.780
Long Island...

04:37.780 --> 04:39.450
And it's not a fire.
It's a homicide.

04:39.450 --> 04:41.160
An author of some repute
has wound up dead

04:41.160 --> 04:42.910
and we need to get to
the crime scene, ASAP.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.200
I don't understand.
Is that a tattoo
connection?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.120
Uh, you could say that.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.030
(Rich)
I believe this was
Jane's coming out party.

04:50.030 --> 04:51.780
Times Square bomb scare?

04:51.780 --> 04:52.950
Boy, try saying that
five times fast.

04:52.950 --> 04:56.580
Times Square bomb scare,
Times Square bomb scare.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.660
So, this is your
"tattoo connection"?

04:58.660 --> 05:01.780
Several of these articles
are about corrupt officials

05:01.780 --> 05:04.240
that were taken down
as a result of tattoo cases.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.910
Methinks Jane
has a secret admirer.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.700
Or not.
None of them actually
mention her.

05:07.700 --> 05:11.700
Most of these articles
have nothing to do
with the tattoos.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.780
They're not even
FBI cases, Rich.

05:16.330 --> 05:18.160
So he was propped up...

05:18.160 --> 05:20.030
Pen put in his hand,
post-mortem.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.660
Killer trying to send
a message?

05:21.660 --> 05:24.160
Well, maybe they didn't
like his last novel.
Yeah.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.160
(Reade)
Tell me about the victim.

05:26.160 --> 05:26.990
Uh, Winston Pear.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.660
Became a bestselling author
when when he latched onto

05:29.660 --> 05:31.370
the whole
true crime fad.

05:31.370 --> 05:34.410
I wouldn't say that
"he latched onto it."

05:34.410 --> 05:35.780
More like he started it.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.370
Kurt has all of his books.
Read two on our honeymoon.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.490
But I read 'em on the plane,
okay, just to be clear.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.450
Uh, "Winston Pear is
internationally renowned

05:43.450 --> 05:46.910
"for his genre-bending novels
where fictional detectives

05:46.910 --> 05:47.740
solve real crimes."

05:47.740 --> 05:49.120
Oh, come on,
that is totally cheating.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.280
He's also "renowned" for his
inability to write women.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.660
They're either victims
or sex objects or usually both.

05:55.660 --> 05:58.030
His writing is
a little "dated."

05:58.030 --> 06:01.450
But his books have led
to actual arrests.

06:01.450 --> 06:03.530
The Hell's Kitchen
diamond thieves.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.030
The Coney Island
kidnappers--

06:05.030 --> 06:06.410
They get it,
you're a super fan.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.280
I'm not a super fan.
Whatever you say.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.620
The blood spatter indicates
he was killed right there.
And with that.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.080
Then the killer
went through the house

06:14.080 --> 06:16.280
and trashed everything
looking for something.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.870
Or trying to make it look like
they were looking for something

06:18.870 --> 06:21.700
to hide the fact that it was
actually a crime of passion?

06:21.700 --> 06:23.990
Ooh!
Or a suicide.

06:23.990 --> 06:26.240
Huh? See now we're writing
a mystery novel.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.030
There's no computer.
Maybe the killer took it?

06:28.030 --> 06:30.450
No, he was really
old school.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.450
He only ever
used typewriters.

06:32.450 --> 06:33.950
Ugh, pretentious.
No, I mean, he thought

06:33.950 --> 06:38.120
that it helped him connect
to the words more, like...

06:39.490 --> 06:40.990
Yeah, all right,
I might be a super fan.

06:40.990 --> 06:44.910
(Rich)
Okay, uh, speaking of being
connected to the words more.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.870
Here is something
that might help us.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.490
A voice from beyond
the grave.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.700
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

06:49.700 --> 06:52.620
(Winston)There's someone trying
to break into my house.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.330
I think it's--

06:53.330 --> 06:54.870
I think they're after my--
(glass breaking)

06:54.870 --> 06:57.030
They're in the house.
Who is in the house, sir?

06:57.030 --> 06:58.450
Sir? Are you still there?

06:58.450 --> 07:00.620
Oh, I thought this
would be longer.
Wait, play it again.

07:00.620 --> 07:04.370
9-1-1, what's your emergency?
There's someone trying
to break into--

07:04.370 --> 07:06.910
Stop.
At the beginning.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.200
That "tick" sound.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.950
It almost sounds
like a... um...

07:12.950 --> 07:15.660
(clock ticking)

07:15.660 --> 07:17.240
Huh.
(loud ticking)

07:17.240 --> 07:21.280
Winston was right here
when he first made the call.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.370
9-1-1, what's your emergency

07:22.370 --> 07:24.370
There's someone trying
to break into my house.

07:24.370 --> 07:27.120
But the other sound
on that recording

07:27.120 --> 07:28.620
could be that latch.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.200
(Winston)
There's someone trying
to break into my house.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.280
(loud ticking)

07:39.160 --> 07:40.700
A manuscript?

07:40.700 --> 07:41.870
The plot thickens.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.200
"Inked to Death:

07:44.200 --> 07:46.030
A Jane Doe Mystery."

07:46.030 --> 07:48.530
(Patterson)
It's about Jane?

07:48.530 --> 07:51.450
No, it's about
all of us.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.370
(clock ticking)

07:54.370 --> 07:57.080
If he was killed because
of what he was writing...

07:57.080 --> 07:58.160
And the book is about us...

07:58.160 --> 08:00.240
Then we just found ourselves
smack dab in the middle

08:00.240 --> 08:03.330
of an old-fashioned
murder mystery.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.200
Looks like we're dealing
with a serial killer.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.530
And not just any run-of-the-mill
Ted Bundy-type...

08:19.530 --> 08:21.830
This is the work
of The New York Ripper.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.240
Making this
his 35th victim.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.490
And making him
the deadliest serial killer
in this state's history.

08:27.490 --> 08:30.490
(long whistle)
Life goals.

08:30.490 --> 08:31.370
I'm sensing something.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.580
There's a pattern
to these murders.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.620
Jane's right.
Sorry I'm late.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.580
The Nikkei opened
down 5% today

08:37.580 --> 08:38.910
and my investors
are freaking out.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.330
Such is the life when
you're an FBI super agent

08:41.330 --> 08:44.240
and the CEO
of a major tech company.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.080
Hmm.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.160
If you connect the dots
to his kill sites,

08:49.160 --> 08:53.410
they match the shaded area
to Jane's centaur tattoo.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.120
(Jane's voice)
Nice work, Peterson.
Nice work.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.200
(Reade)
Kurt Walker,
Edgar Reece.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.030
Rich DotBiz.

09:02.030 --> 09:05.410
And he even got Special Agent
Peterson's first name right.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.280
These "fictional
detectives" are us.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.950
Except that I don't
have a centaur tattoo.

09:08.950 --> 09:12.240
We've never worked a case
with a "New York Ripper."

09:12.240 --> 09:14.120
I've never even heard
of that serial killer.

09:14.120 --> 09:14.910
Also "Life goals"?

09:14.910 --> 09:17.330
I mean, isn't death goals
the obvious joke?

09:17.330 --> 09:19.240
(Patterson)
Who does science
in 6-inch heels?

09:19.240 --> 09:21.450
Why does he spend all this time
describing women's shoes?

09:21.450 --> 09:24.240
Why not spend a paragraph
on Rich's loafers?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.990
But he kind of did
get our essence.

09:25.990 --> 09:29.660
(scoffs)
Whatever, Mr. "Billowing
biceps, threatening

09:29.660 --> 09:31.030
to rip through
his shirt."

09:31.030 --> 09:32.700
(Reade)
Winston Pear invents
a serial killer

09:32.700 --> 09:34.580
and a tattoo to go with it
just to put us

09:34.580 --> 09:36.330
in a story?
How does he even know us?

09:36.330 --> 09:39.620
Invented a tattoo? Yes.
A serial killer, maybe not.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.490
The reason we've never heard
of "The New York Ripper"

09:41.490 --> 09:43.620
is because it's a name
coined by Winston.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.950
He has a theory that
three dozen

09:45.950 --> 09:46.950
real murders in Long Island

09:46.950 --> 09:48.240
have been committed by
the same person.

09:48.240 --> 09:51.740
Check out this tweet from
Winston's publisher:

09:51.740 --> 09:54.580
"Next summer, Winston Pear
is going to unearth

09:54.580 --> 09:55.700
New York's deadliest mystery."

09:55.700 --> 09:58.990
Sounds like he was
ready to name a person
that matches his theory.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.700
Yeah, a name the real killer
doesn't want getting out.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.660
Then why don't we just
skip to the end?

10:04.660 --> 10:07.160
"As the team races the clock
to stop this anonymous

10:07.160 --> 10:10.870
killing machine from taking
another life..." Oh.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.240
It just stops.
It's not complete.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.990
"Anonymous killing machine"
doesn't real help.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, it looks like
we need to figure out

10:16.280 --> 10:18.120
how Winston was planning
on ending his book.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.450
That's not gonna be easy.
His whole life was analog.

10:20.450 --> 10:26.240
No computer, no cell phone.
His car has an 8-track.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.780
Let's just hope Winston didn't
take the killer's identity

10:28.780 --> 10:30.530
to the grave with him.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.410
Rich, coordinate with
local police and get

10:36.410 --> 10:38.530
as much evidence as you can
back to our office.

10:38.530 --> 10:41.530
I want a list of every suspect
they've got for all 35

10:41.530 --> 10:44.160
of those murders.
Okay.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.370
Looks like word got
out who died here.

10:48.660 --> 10:51.280
(indistinct radio chatter)

10:53.700 --> 10:55.200
Hey...

10:55.200 --> 10:58.160
You see that guy on my six?

10:58.160 --> 10:59.120
Could just
be a lookie-loo.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.910
It could also be the killer
looking for the manuscript.

11:02.910 --> 11:06.370
Sir? FBI.

11:06.370 --> 11:07.620
Stop!
Got a runner!

11:07.620 --> 11:10.990
(Weller on radio)
Jane, do you have eyes
on him?!

11:11.280 --> 11:14.410
(high-pitched ringing)

11:14.410 --> 11:16.910
(muted)I need you to intercept him!

11:16.910 --> 11:18.740
Jane!

11:22.580 --> 11:24.370
(both grunting)

11:25.160 --> 11:26.700
(muted sound)
(Weller)
FBI!

11:26.700 --> 11:29.700
But I didn't do anything.
That's why you ran?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.330
That's it.
Come on.

11:31.330 --> 11:35.330
(distorted sound)

11:45.020 --> 11:46.680
Are you okay?
Yeah.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.680
Yeah, it's just
a little denim burn

11:48.680 --> 11:50.270
from when
I side-tackled that guy.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.890
I'm talking about
before the tackle.

11:52.890 --> 11:54.810
C'mere.
Hmm?

11:54.810 --> 11:57.180
Patterson said that
your vitals spiked.

11:57.180 --> 12:00.890
So, what was that?
Like, a migraine?

12:00.890 --> 12:03.520
Not exactly.
More like a...

12:03.520 --> 12:05.730
ear-piercing drone
followed by silence,

12:05.730 --> 12:08.520
but it only lasted
a couple seconds.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.730
A couple of seconds?
Jane...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.640
I still got the guy,
didn't I?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.350
Patterson said she's okay
with me being out

12:14.350 --> 12:15.600
in the field as long
as I got this on.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.810
But if you think I should
dial back on my activity--

12:19.810 --> 12:22.600
No, I don't want you
to do anything for me.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.020
All right, you gotta
do it for yourself.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.350
Trust your gut.
(cell phone buzzes)

12:28.350 --> 12:32.140
Suspect is ready for us
in the interrogation room.

12:32.140 --> 12:34.060
Get this.
He's an agent.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.270
CIA? NSA?

12:35.270 --> 12:37.600
Nope, try again.

12:37.770 --> 12:40.350
I'm telling you,
I'm just his literary agent.

12:40.350 --> 12:43.230
When I heard about Winston,
I went right down there.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.060
To steal evidence?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.600
No, to make sure someone
was looking after

12:45.600 --> 12:47.100
my client's
best interests.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.060
Your dead client.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.890
(sighs)
Now, that book,

12:49.890 --> 12:52.310
that'd be worth millions,
wouldn't it?

12:52.310 --> 12:54.350
Probably more now.

12:54.350 --> 12:55.600
Wait.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.430
You think I killed him?

12:57.430 --> 12:58.770
No, no, no.

12:58.770 --> 12:59.850
Okay, you're right.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.810
I did want to get my hands
on the manuscript.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.020
It is worth a lot,
but only

13:03.020 --> 13:04.600
if it's delivered
to the publisher.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
I was just gonna borrow it,

13:05.600 --> 13:08.020
make a copy
and then put it back.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.060
That's not still
an option, is it?

13:10.060 --> 13:10.560
No.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.520
But if you tell us everything
you know about the book,

13:12.520 --> 13:15.140
maybe we'll keep you
out of jail.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.810
Winston had been trying
to write

13:16.810 --> 13:17.890
about the Ripper for years,

13:17.890 --> 13:20.140
but he could never find
a way into the story.

13:20.140 --> 13:24.270
Until Times Square
got evacuated because
of a bomb scare

13:24.270 --> 13:26.810
a couple years ago,
you remember that?

13:28.930 --> 13:29.930
It sounds vaguely familiar.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.520
Winston thought it was weird
that there was never

13:31.520 --> 13:34.890
any follow-up about it,
so he pinged his NYPD contacts,

13:34.890 --> 13:36.100
got in touch
with the beat cops

13:36.100 --> 13:37.890
and bomb squad guys
that were there.

13:37.890 --> 13:41.810
And that's when he found out
about... this naked lady

13:41.810 --> 13:45.930
who came out of a bag,
covered in tattoos from h...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.930
Holy...

13:51.930 --> 13:53.430
You're her, aren't you?

13:53.430 --> 13:54.770
Focus, Ronnie.

13:54.770 --> 13:55.480
That was it.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.810
He couldn't get that image
out of his head.

13:57.810 --> 13:58.890
He had to write about it.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.060
Where does the Ripper
come in?

14:00.060 --> 14:02.520
The perfect mystery
needs the perfect

14:02.520 --> 14:04.430
crime-solving team,
right?

14:04.430 --> 14:07.350
For Winston,
she-- you--

14:07.350 --> 14:10.060
were the ideal foil
for the Ripper.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.060
You're not represented,
are you?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.640
I'm thinking
about getting into...

14:13.640 --> 14:15.140
How does the book end?

14:15.140 --> 14:15.890
I can't tell you.

14:15.890 --> 14:19.480
I'm pretty sure that Winston's
not gonna fire you.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.430
Well, I can't tell you
because I don't know.

14:22.430 --> 14:24.350
He only trusted
a few select people

14:24.350 --> 14:26.310
with the details
of his works-in-progress.

14:26.310 --> 14:30.180
Like?
Like Frankie, his editor.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.680
I don't know any other names
specifically.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.140
They may be
in his notebook.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.350
What notebook?

14:36.350 --> 14:40.980
Winston kept all his notes
and research in a red Moleskine.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.890
His theories.

14:41.890 --> 14:42.980
Who he talked to
about the case.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.810
It was like an extension
of his brain.

14:44.810 --> 14:47.390
Never saw him
without it.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.810
I've been looking through
all the murders

14:49.810 --> 14:52.100
Winston attributed
to the Ripper.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.020
No consistent M.O.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.390
Some of them
look ritualistic,

14:54.390 --> 14:55.560
others look
completely random.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.390
The cops have over a hundred
suspects for them in total.

14:58.390 --> 15:01.270
Why did Winston think
these were all done

15:01.270 --> 15:02.430
by the same person?

15:02.430 --> 15:05.100
Only one way
to find out.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.350
You want me to do
a book report?

15:06.350 --> 15:07.980
It's the best lead
we got going.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.100
Make copies for everyone.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.770
Hey, have you heard
from Zapata?

15:12.770 --> 15:13.520
Not yet.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.680
(Rich)
So this is very, very bad.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.230
(Weller)
Oh, yeah?
What's bad?

15:16.230 --> 15:17.680
We've hit a dead end.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.310
Literally.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.100
The Agents that went to pick
up Winston's book editor

15:20.100 --> 15:22.770
found her
a little less than alive.

15:22.770 --> 15:23.600
And unlike Winston,

15:23.600 --> 15:25.850
whose murder was interrupted
by a 911 call,

15:25.850 --> 15:28.140
looks like the Ripper really
took his time with this one.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.180
(Jane)
Her lips are sewn shut.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.140
It's not too hard to figure out
what that means.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.810
He's silencing anyone
connected to the manuscript.

15:33.810 --> 15:35.350
What about Winston's notebook?

15:35.350 --> 15:36.480
Talked to local PD.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.850
Not only was it
not taken into evidence,

15:37.850 --> 15:40.930
but CSU didn't even list one
in their crime scene inventory.

15:40.930 --> 15:43.520
So, either they haven't
found one yet, or...

15:43.520 --> 15:44.180
Someone took it.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.390
If the Ripper has
Winston's notebook,

15:45.390 --> 15:46.770
that means
he's got a road map

15:46.770 --> 15:50.100
to everyone he needs
to kill next.

15:53.270 --> 15:57.020
(suspenseful music plays)

16:04.870 --> 16:06.240
The placement
of the murder weapon,

16:06.240 --> 16:10.530
the wealth of physical
evidence...

16:10.530 --> 16:12.240
These crime scenes,

16:12.240 --> 16:17.330
they're almost...
too perfect.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.660
(gasps)

16:21.060 --> 16:23.770
I can't.
We can't.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.100
We can.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.600
Not here, not again.

16:29.930 --> 16:31.770
I just keep thinking
about your wife.

16:31.770 --> 16:34.140
Oh, to hell with
my disinterested wife!

16:34.140 --> 16:35.930
Shh!

16:38.730 --> 16:41.890
Maybe this will help
set the mood.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.270
(romantic music plays)

16:48.640 --> 16:51.310
"The forbidden lovers share
a toast before embracing.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.640
Their bodies intertwining
like two snakes in a pit of--"

16:54.640 --> 16:55.890
Oh, my God.
Okay.

16:55.890 --> 16:56.850
Well, you get the picture.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.770
Yeah, I would like
to send it back.

16:58.770 --> 16:59.930
Also, it says
I have a wife.

16:59.930 --> 17:02.180
Okay, first of all,
if I was married,
which I never would be,

17:02.180 --> 17:04.520
I would have multiple wives
and a husband.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.600
And what does it even mean
for a crime scene

17:06.600 --> 17:07.980
to be "too perfect"?

17:07.980 --> 17:08.850
Speaking of not having

17:08.850 --> 17:10.890
any grounding in reality,
listen to this.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.850
"Rich DotBiz, willing to put
his criminal past behind him

17:13.850 --> 17:14.930
"and work with the Feds

17:14.930 --> 17:16.390
"not out of a desire
for redemption,

17:16.390 --> 17:18.480
"but out of
a desire for friendship.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.270
"True friendship.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.640
"Something that's
always been lacking

17:20.640 --> 17:22.890
in the life of this spastic
emissary of chaos."

17:22.890 --> 17:25.520
Where does he come up
with this crap?!

17:25.520 --> 17:26.350
Yeah, where does he?

17:26.350 --> 17:29.600
Okay, talking to his usual
law enforcement contacts,

17:29.600 --> 17:31.100
I can see how Winston
figured out

17:31.100 --> 17:32.230
much of the stuff
in this book.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.350
But the fact that you
don't have any friends?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.770
Hey, okay,
I have friends, all right?

17:36.770 --> 17:38.480
They're just... in Canada.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.560
And how the hell
does Winston Pear

17:41.560 --> 17:43.310
know where I keep
my celebratory reserve?

17:43.310 --> 17:46.060
Hmm, I see what you're saying.
Let's get drunk.

17:46.060 --> 17:49.270
No.
No, we have a rat.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.710
Is the book that bad?

18:00.710 --> 18:03.670
No. Well, yes.
(chuckles)

18:03.670 --> 18:05.630
That's not
what's bothering me.

18:05.630 --> 18:08.250
All this reading in
this fluorescent light

18:08.250 --> 18:11.330
is just killing my eyes.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.830
You okay?

18:13.830 --> 18:15.790
Do you wanna keep going?

18:15.790 --> 18:16.710
Yeah, yeah.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.330
Check out the size
of these forensics reports.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.500
It's pretty extensive.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.630
When's the last time
you saw a forensics report
that complete?

18:24.630 --> 18:25.290
Uh, never.

18:25.290 --> 18:28.000
It's as though
every piece of evidence

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
CSU would expect
to find was left

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
right where they would
expect to find it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.250
The Ripper has to be a cop.

18:34.420 --> 18:37.880
Someone in the office
was talking to Winston.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.500
What?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.130
The devil is literally
in the details.

18:40.130 --> 18:43.540
What's in the drawers.
Who's keeping secrets.
Jane's migraines--

18:43.540 --> 18:45.210
Wait, he wrote about
my ZIP poisoning?

18:45.210 --> 18:46.920
No, I think he thinks
you're pregnant.

18:46.920 --> 18:47.500
Or psychic.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.080
Or pregnant and your baby's
gonna be psychic?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.540
The only way Winston
could know this stuff

18:50.540 --> 18:54.170
is from someone who is
in very close proximity to us.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.830
But who?

19:00.380 --> 19:01.630
Uh, class,
if you would, please,

19:01.630 --> 19:05.500
turn to page 77
in your textbooks.

19:06.710 --> 19:07.630
I can't believe this.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.830
Did I step out of bounds?
Step out of bounds?

19:09.830 --> 19:12.500
I think you just broke
this whole case wide open.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.000
We need to talk to you.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.080
(Reade)
It can wait.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.500
(Weller)
Rich has got something.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.330
No, Briana's got
something.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.290
It's incredible.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.670
You came up with this
on your own?

19:25.670 --> 19:27.710
No, you guys had
most of the pieces,

19:27.710 --> 19:30.330
I just... filled in
the blanks.

19:30.330 --> 19:31.960
People say
I'm a perfectionist,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.460
that I dot every "I,"
cross every "T."

19:34.460 --> 19:35.750
It's just that
when I see

19:35.750 --> 19:37.420
even the smallest
detail missing,

19:37.420 --> 19:39.460
it's like a black hole,
sucking me in.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.960
I guess that,
where everyone else

19:41.960 --> 19:43.380
sees the world
as it is,

19:43.380 --> 19:45.460
I see the world
as it isn't.

19:45.460 --> 19:46.580
I see what's not there.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.710
Well, you're wasting
your talents behind a desk.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.540
You need to be
in the field.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.330
With a gun and a badge.

19:55.460 --> 19:59.460
(Reade)
"Welcome to the
Big Leagues, Briana."

19:59.460 --> 20:00.790
Should I keep reading,
or do you have

20:00.790 --> 20:03.290
something to tell us?
Oh, my God.

20:03.290 --> 20:05.080
I'm so sorry.

20:05.080 --> 20:05.920
I thought I was just...

20:05.920 --> 20:08.920
Winston Pear reached out to me
to help him with the research.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.380
I didn't realize...

20:10.380 --> 20:12.420
How much trouble am I in?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.210
Why did you do it?

20:13.210 --> 20:14.920
I-- I didn't realize
what I was doing.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.500
When he first reached out,
he was just asking about
protocol, procedure.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.290
When he started
to ask about you guys,

20:20.290 --> 20:22.130
I thought
it was off the record.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.210
How did he even find you?

20:23.210 --> 20:25.580
I went to college
with his stepdaughter.

20:25.580 --> 20:26.460
I thought it was weird

20:26.460 --> 20:28.420
when he reached out to me
of all people.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.170
It just felt good
to be useful, you know?

20:31.170 --> 20:34.670
He said that I was helping
to catch a dangerous criminal!

20:34.670 --> 20:36.750
We catch criminals here
every day.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.790
No,youcatch criminals
here every day.

20:39.790 --> 20:40.960
I get people
to sign things.

20:40.960 --> 20:44.290
(Weller)
How long had you two
been talking?

20:44.290 --> 20:45.500
About a year.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.790
The deeper he got
into the book,

20:46.790 --> 20:49.380
the more he'd call.
(cell phone chimes)

20:49.380 --> 20:50.460
Patterson's got something.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.250
See if Briana here
knows something

20:52.250 --> 20:55.080
that'll help us
catch this guy.

20:56.580 --> 20:57.580
Break in the case?

20:57.580 --> 20:59.790
In the book,
the FBI was fixated

20:59.790 --> 21:01.130
on specific cuts found
on the victims.

21:01.130 --> 21:04.040
So we looked for cuts in
the real world, and we found...

21:04.040 --> 21:08.210
every victim has incisions made
with a scalpel-like knife.

21:08.210 --> 21:09.630
The cuts were
surprisingly precise,

21:09.630 --> 21:12.000
slicing the dermis but not
the subcutaneous tissue.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.920
Suggesting that the killer has
a medical background.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.130
You don't need to go
to medical school to be
good with a scalpel.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.330
No, but it helps.

21:18.330 --> 21:19.630
And it gave us
another vector

21:19.630 --> 21:21.330
in our hunt for
Winston's suspect.

21:21.330 --> 21:23.750
Vector one--
Long Island residents

21:23.750 --> 21:25.000
who work
in law enforcement.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.380
(Rich)
It's a long list.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.880
Vector two--
Have a medical background.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.880
(Rich)
Slightly shorter list.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.710
Vector three--
Have worked or lived

21:32.710 --> 21:34.000
near the murder clusters.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.830
That's a very short list.
How short?

21:35.830 --> 21:37.670
One name--
Gerald "Geri" Savitt.

21:37.670 --> 21:40.880
He's a detective with
the Suffolk County PD.
Former paramedic.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.420
The best part, as a child,
he had a history

21:43.420 --> 21:44.540
of abusing animals.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.040
I don't know why I said that
with a smile on my face.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.880
It's a hallmark
of burgeoning serial killers.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.880
How positive are you
that this is the guy

21:49.880 --> 21:51.630
Winston ID'd as the Ripper?

21:51.630 --> 21:52.460
I found a Post-It note

21:52.460 --> 21:54.210
with the words
"Falcon Head" written on it.

21:54.210 --> 21:56.040
Falcon Head happens to be
the name of a ranch

21:56.040 --> 21:59.540
owned by Savitt's parents,
where he grew up, so...

21:59.540 --> 22:01.210
73%.
1,000%.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.170
What are you gettin'
mad at me for

22:03.170 --> 22:04.830
Have a little
confidence.

22:04.830 --> 22:06.580
(cell phone vibrates)

22:06.580 --> 22:10.540
(Weller)
Did he ever talk to you
about his theory?

22:10.540 --> 22:12.080
Who he thought did it?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.710
Not specifically.

22:13.710 --> 22:16.710
But he did once
refer to the killer as "GS."

22:16.710 --> 22:17.630
(Jane)
He did?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.500
It was during the last call
that I got from him.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.040
It was...
It was a different kind of call.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.540
He didn't ask
about you guys.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.040
He just wanted to talk.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.670
He sounded frustrated
and a little drunk.

22:28.670 --> 22:33.000
He said that he was having
doubts about his "GS" theory.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.210
What kind of doubts?

22:35.210 --> 22:37.420
He had just gotten ahold of
some kind of travel records.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.790
He said that they gave "GS"
too many alibis.

22:39.790 --> 22:43.080
Winston was worried that he'd
have to go back to square one

22:43.080 --> 22:45.170
or abandon the entire book.

22:45.170 --> 22:45.710
Great.

22:45.710 --> 22:49.130
So the book might not
just be incomplete.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.290
It could be worthless.

23:02.330 --> 23:03.830
Rise and shine,
sweetheart.

23:03.830 --> 23:06.040
Look, I'm telling you,
you got this all wrong.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.880
(tasing, men groaning)

23:09.580 --> 23:12.000
(stun guns buzzing)

23:17.540 --> 23:18.380
We need to hurry.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.500
There are more CIA operatives
on the way.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.330
I'm a friend
of Madeline's.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.420
Let's go!

23:32.920 --> 23:36.540
I can feel the Ripper
slipping away from us.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.790
Every lead drying up.

23:38.790 --> 23:42.580
He's gonna kill again soon,
and what are we doing?

23:42.580 --> 23:44.330
Just chasing our tails.

23:44.330 --> 23:47.170
I don't like what this case
is doing to you.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.080
Yeah, well...

23:48.080 --> 23:50.210
You wanna catch
a monster...

23:50.210 --> 23:53.130
sometimes you gotta
become a monster.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.330
Well, before you do
anything rash,

23:55.330 --> 23:58.420
you might want
to take a look at this.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.170
Is that...?
It is.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.790
Does that say...?
It does.

24:09.790 --> 24:12.460
Took two tests
just to be sure.

24:12.460 --> 24:15.330
We're going to be
parents.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.670
I "glove" you.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.880
(Rich)
"I glove you"?

24:24.880 --> 24:25.880
There's typos in this.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.080
Why are you still
reading that drivel?

24:27.080 --> 24:29.040
The killer is still out there,
primed to strike again.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.500
Nothing in that book
is gonna stop him.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.250
All right.
Wait a second.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.210
What if they're not typos?

24:33.210 --> 24:36.380
What if it was
a mechanical failure?

24:36.380 --> 24:37.000
Holy crap.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.250
I'm not following--
No time to explain!

24:41.380 --> 24:42.710
Oh, hey.
Rich.

24:42.710 --> 24:43.670
Oh, yeah, you know what?

24:43.670 --> 24:45.080
You got me and Patterson
all wrong.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.000
Also, I have friends, okay?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.080
You would know that
if you came

24:47.080 --> 24:48.670
to my Cinco de Mayo party
last September.

24:48.670 --> 24:49.960
Also, I'm sorry
I didn't invite you

24:49.960 --> 24:53.130
to my Cinco de Mayo party
last September.

24:54.380 --> 24:55.580
Briana.

24:55.580 --> 24:56.130
Hi.

24:56.130 --> 24:59.580
Now, she's been talking
to Winston... a lot.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.830
Yes.
So I gathered.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.010
So we thought maybe
looking at some evidence

25:04.010 --> 25:06.800
might help her remember
some useful information

25:06.800 --> 25:08.340
from their conversations.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.180
How do we know
if Winston's research

25:10.180 --> 25:11.130
is even useful anymore?

25:11.130 --> 25:13.340
These are copies
of the travel records

25:13.340 --> 25:14.680
he got ahold of
last week.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.550
They show that
Gerald Savitt traveled

25:16.550 --> 25:19.090
(high-pitched ringing)
for criminology lectures
around the country

25:19.090 --> 25:22.180
and wasn't even in the state
for most of the murders.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.510
So he was right
to abandon that theory.

25:23.510 --> 25:26.840
So you're saying
that the Ripper killed
Winston for nothing?

25:26.840 --> 25:29.050
Just because of a tweet
that said he knew who did it?

25:29.050 --> 25:29.970
(Weller)
I don't buy it.

25:29.970 --> 25:31.590
Something in Winston's
investigation

25:31.590 --> 25:33.010
spooked the Ripper.
(ringing continues)

25:33.010 --> 25:34.940
Someone he talked to.
Someplace he went.

25:34.940 --> 25:35.650
(Rich)
Behold!

25:35.650 --> 25:37.940
I give you Winston's
primary typewriter.

25:37.940 --> 25:39.650
It's in nearly every photo
taken of him.

25:39.650 --> 25:41.190
Now, when they found it,
there was no paper in it

25:41.190 --> 25:45.190
and the ribbon was clean,
so kind of a dead end, right?

25:45.190 --> 25:47.230
Not really a lead.

25:47.230 --> 25:48.280
Check this out.
(typing)

25:48.280 --> 25:49.820
Huh.
(hitting keys)

25:49.820 --> 25:50.400
Huh?

25:50.400 --> 25:53.400
The "L" and the "G"
typebars...

25:53.400 --> 25:56.900
are stuck together.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.690
So Winston switched
typewriters.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.730
Each ribbon makes an imprint
for every keystroke.

26:01.730 --> 26:03.730
So, if we can just get our hands
on the right typewriter,

26:03.730 --> 26:06.610
we could figure out what Winston
was typing on his last days.

26:06.610 --> 26:08.980
Including whatever
didn't make it in
the final manuscript.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.940
You know, some pages
could have been discarded.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.780
Maybe the killer
took some out.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.650
Now, based on the slight

26:13.650 --> 26:14.940
typeface differences
in the final chapter,

26:14.940 --> 26:17.280
it's clear that Winston
switched to an IBM Selectric.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.360
I already called Nassau PD,
they said a Selectric

26:19.360 --> 26:21.190
was found at the scene
of the crime.

26:21.190 --> 26:22.190
I told them not to touch it,

26:22.190 --> 26:23.130
that I'd be right up there
to get it.

26:23.130 --> 26:25.080
As long as you guys are cool
with me driving up there.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.040
Fine, but you can't go alone.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.420
Do I get to pick
my away team?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.460
I'll-- I'll go with him.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.290
You sure?
Yeah.

26:29.290 --> 26:31.830
I could use some fresh air
and sunlight right about now.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.040
(Rich)
All right! Keys?

26:34.040 --> 26:34.880
Be careful.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.630
Shotgun. Driving.
Okay. Just...

26:40.280 --> 26:41.650
Aren't you curious
on who just saved your life?

26:41.650 --> 26:45.190
You're Dominic Masters,
security consultant,

26:45.190 --> 26:46.360
and Madeline's first hire

26:46.360 --> 26:48.650
after she took over
HCI Global.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.360
You've spent the better
part of two decades

26:50.360 --> 26:52.190
working for oil companies,

26:52.190 --> 26:53.150
setting up
their operations

26:53.150 --> 26:54.650
in hostile regions
around the world.

26:54.650 --> 26:56.900
But I got the picture
you weren't the kind of guy

26:56.900 --> 26:58.730
who liked getting
his hands dirty.

26:58.730 --> 27:01.360
My hands look dirty to you?

27:02.320 --> 27:03.730
So how long were you
tailing me?

27:03.730 --> 27:05.940
Madeline just sent me
here today.

27:05.940 --> 27:06.980
Really?

27:06.980 --> 27:09.730
Just today, huh?

27:09.730 --> 27:11.030
You just so happened
to be there

27:11.030 --> 27:12.980
when I got nabbed
by the CIA?

27:12.980 --> 27:13.530
Yeah.

27:13.530 --> 27:15.940
Actually it was the cartel
she was worried about.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.030
You're lucky I was there.

27:17.030 --> 27:20.320
Now let's get you safely
back to the States.

27:20.320 --> 27:20.940
No. No!

27:20.940 --> 27:24.570
I need to get back for
that meeting with Del Toro.

27:24.570 --> 27:25.280
Not gonna happen.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.400
You missed your meet
with Del Toro,

27:26.400 --> 27:27.570
and guys like that
don't wait around.

27:27.570 --> 27:29.030
For what Madeline's offering
his boss, he might.

27:29.030 --> 27:31.440
And if there's any chance
he's still there,

27:31.440 --> 27:33.230
I have to take it.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.440
We both know what'll happen

27:34.440 --> 27:36.110
if I show up to Madeline
empty-handed.

27:36.110 --> 27:40.320
Yeah, I do.
Which is why I need
to bring you back.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.280
(stun gun powering up)

27:41.280 --> 27:42.400
I'm going back
with or without you.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.650
So you can show up
with nothing,

27:43.650 --> 27:46.900
or you can show up
with me and Del Toro.

27:47.940 --> 27:48.730
Fine.

27:48.730 --> 27:51.360
One stop before
the airport.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.280
(Weller)
What is Falcon Head?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.110
Savitt's childhood home.

27:56.110 --> 27:58.980
It was a major clue
that Winston was zeroing in

27:58.980 --> 28:00.610
on Savitt as
his prime suspect.

28:00.610 --> 28:01.820
But we already
ruled him out,

28:01.820 --> 28:03.320
so unless he's got
an evil twin...

28:03.320 --> 28:05.440
Can you pull up
the persons-of-interest list

28:05.440 --> 28:07.690
on all 35 murders?
Yeah.

28:07.690 --> 28:13.030
One... super long
persons of interest list.

28:13.030 --> 28:16.110
Hmm, more like men
of interest list.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.070
There's no women on it.

28:18.070 --> 28:22.860
Well, statistically,
85% of serial killers are...

28:23.980 --> 28:25.440
Oh, my God.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.570
Briana, you're a genius.
I am?

28:27.570 --> 28:30.150
What if Winston was
so blinded by the stats,

28:30.150 --> 28:31.570
not to mention his own
unconscious bias,

28:31.570 --> 28:34.480
that he missed a suspect?
(papers shuffling)

28:34.480 --> 28:36.480
Someone who shared geography
with Gerald,

28:36.480 --> 28:37.400
who crossed paths with

28:37.400 --> 28:39.400
the same people
he crossed paths with.

28:39.400 --> 28:43.360
Someone who spent a lot of time
at Falcon Head.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.730
I thought you were
just kidding

28:44.730 --> 28:46.190
about the whole
evil twin thing.

28:46.190 --> 28:50.530
I was.
But Gerald has a stepsister.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.030
Iris Bricklemyer.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.900
(Weller)
As a kid, she lived with
Gerald for half the year.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.190
They were roommates for
a chunk of their adulthood.

28:58.190 --> 28:59.320
She's a cop, too.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
Auxiliary officer, SFPD.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.980
(Reade)
Please tell me her day job
was in medicine.

29:04.150 --> 29:07.780
Uh, no,
but she did do this.

29:09.530 --> 29:10.360
(Weller)
That's cute.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.610
(Reade)
Yeah, in a horrifying kinda way.

29:11.610 --> 29:13.610
Yeah, and it's much
harder than it looks.

29:13.610 --> 29:15.190
Making these dioramas
requires

29:15.190 --> 29:17.900
a hobby knife
and surgical precision.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.690
Hobby knife's a lot
like a scalpel.

29:19.690 --> 29:20.650
(Patterson)
Exactly.

29:20.650 --> 29:23.070
No wonder these crimes
look staged.

29:23.070 --> 29:24.570
The victims were posed.

29:24.570 --> 29:25.320
She was making art.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.190
Life-sized versions
of her dioramas.

29:27.590 --> 29:29.220
(Weller)
We can't afford
to be wrong again.

29:29.220 --> 29:32.930
Can you check to see
if she ever traveled
with her brother?

29:41.630 --> 29:43.880
(high-pitched ringing)

29:44.480 --> 29:46.320
Jane.
You okay?

29:46.520 --> 29:50.180
I-- I don't know.
My vision's
getting all...

29:50.180 --> 29:52.100
Your vision's
all what?

29:52.100 --> 29:54.780
(distorted sound)

29:54.780 --> 29:57.030
Rich...
I can't see.

29:57.030 --> 29:58.320
What? Should we go
to the hospital?

29:58.320 --> 29:59.480
We should go to
the hospital, right?

29:59.480 --> 30:00.730
No, no, no.
We're already here.

30:00.730 --> 30:03.190
Just get the typewriter
ribbon first.
Really?

30:03.190 --> 30:04.650
Yeah, you want to come
all the way

30:04.650 --> 30:05.780
back out
to Long Island?

30:05.780 --> 30:08.730
Okay, you make
a valid point.
I'll be quick.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.670
Oh...

30:11.670 --> 30:13.630
(panting)

30:28.030 --> 30:29.900
Iris never traveled
with her brother,

30:29.900 --> 30:32.370
which means his alibis
are not hers.

30:32.370 --> 30:33.240
And look at this.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.990
All those times
the police were called

30:34.990 --> 30:36.490
to Gerald's house
as a kid

30:36.490 --> 30:37.490
for animal abuse.

30:37.490 --> 30:38.700
They match
the custody schedule

30:38.700 --> 30:39.660
his parents had
for Iris.

30:39.660 --> 30:42.120
Gerald was covering for
his stepsister.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.280
Send that photo
to Jane and Rich

30:43.280 --> 30:44.740
of our new
prime suspect.

30:44.740 --> 30:46.160
Yep, sending it now.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.080
(beeping)

30:47.080 --> 30:48.120
Whoa, wait a second.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.410
Jane's vitals just spiked.

30:49.410 --> 30:50.910
What do you mean,
"spiked"?

30:50.910 --> 30:52.240
She's in distress.

30:54.870 --> 31:00.330
(phone vibrating
and beeping)

31:00.330 --> 31:01.580
(Weller)Jane, you okay?

31:01.580 --> 31:03.080
No, she's not.
She's blind.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.910
And that woman you just
sent us a picture of?

31:04.910 --> 31:09.120
I'm pretty sure
she just took her.

31:12.830 --> 31:17.160
(distorted sounds)

31:17.160 --> 31:20.910
(Iris)
Winston thought my brother
was the killer?

31:20.910 --> 31:21.950
Geri?

31:21.950 --> 31:24.030
So Winston
had no clue

31:24.030 --> 31:27.080
who I am,
which means

31:27.080 --> 31:31.660
once you're dead,
no one will.

31:31.830 --> 31:35.870
You kill me, the entire FBI
will be looking for you.

31:35.870 --> 31:37.490
Let them try!

31:37.490 --> 31:40.780
What I've got planned,
it'll be worth it.

31:41.330 --> 31:42.580
(Jane)
Why?

31:42.580 --> 31:44.160
What did all those victims
do to you?

31:44.160 --> 31:48.620
They're not victims.
They're subjects.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.530
They should feel honored

31:50.530 --> 31:53.240
that I chose
to immortalize them.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.660
Honored?
You murdered them.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.780
We all die, Jane.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.410
Only a lucky
few of us

32:00.410 --> 32:04.370
get to do it with purpose
and intent like you.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.620
Doesn't Jane's health monitor
use a cell chip

32:07.620 --> 32:08.830
to send you data?
Yes.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.080
But to triangulate
her position,

32:10.080 --> 32:11.580
the phone needs to ping
three cell towers.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.370
Right now it's pinging only
one in a very rural area.

32:14.370 --> 32:16.780
The search area is at least
100 square miles.

32:16.780 --> 32:18.240
The signal's glitching
pretty bad.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.830
(Rich)
Oh, I never should have
left her.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.490
I should've stayed in the car.
I should've taken her

32:21.490 --> 32:22.910
to the hospital.
This is all my fault.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.280
(Weller)
What if it's not glitching?

32:24.280 --> 32:26.330
What is she's
sending us a message?

32:26.330 --> 32:28.620
(beeping)

32:30.660 --> 32:31.830
(beeping)

32:31.830 --> 32:33.280
Thank God
for Morse code.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.280
(beeping continues)

32:37.780 --> 32:39.910
(tires screeching)

32:40.450 --> 32:41.950
(tires skid)

32:43.780 --> 32:45.080
No!
Stay here.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.530
It's bad enough that
I'm getting here late.

32:46.530 --> 32:48.700
I show up with a face
Del Toro isn't expecting,

32:48.700 --> 32:49.740
I'll lose him for sure.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.280
You remember
what happened last time

32:51.280 --> 32:53.030
you showed up here alone?

32:53.030 --> 32:55.580
I don't have a choice.

33:09.910 --> 33:13.080
(phone ringing)

33:19.450 --> 33:21.370
(ringing stops)

33:24.530 --> 33:25.620
Del Toro.

33:25.620 --> 33:26.990
(distorted voice)You're late.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.330
Yeah, I, uh...I don't care.

33:29.330 --> 33:30.910
The only reason
I still have my freedom

33:30.910 --> 33:32.740
is because I know when not
to walk into a room.

33:32.740 --> 33:35.740
And my gut tells me
to stay the hell away from you

33:35.740 --> 33:37.660
and your friend
in the car.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.870
Hey, come on a...
a deal's a deal.

33:39.870 --> 33:41.580
I help up my end,
now it's your turn.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.030
The deal was
for a set meet

33:43.030 --> 33:44.830
at a set time
and you missed it.

33:44.830 --> 33:47.620
Tell your boss you can find
a new hacker.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.620
(line disconnects)

34:03.780 --> 34:05.870
So what happened?
Was he there?

34:05.870 --> 34:06.580
No.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.870
But this was.

34:08.870 --> 34:09.780
He's in.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.530
Gonna meet us
in New York.

34:12.530 --> 34:14.410
Guess I'm your lucky
rabbit's foot.

34:14.410 --> 34:15.530
You get to fly back alive

34:15.530 --> 34:17.450
and give Madeline
the good news.

34:17.450 --> 34:18.700
For a second there,

34:18.700 --> 34:21.200
I thought you were
really screwed.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.240
(engine starting)

34:27.660 --> 34:29.990
(stairs squeaking)

34:29.990 --> 34:32.080
It's a shame
Winston called 9-1-1.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.780
I didn't get a chance
to complete my work on him.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.160
(distorted sound)

34:36.160 --> 34:39.660
What a stupid, wrong-headed
name to give me.

34:39.660 --> 34:42.120
"The Ripper."

34:42.830 --> 34:45.160
Animals rip.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.410
I create.

34:48.660 --> 34:53.780
When you die...
Jane Doe.

34:53.780 --> 34:54.580
(distorted sound)

34:54.580 --> 34:59.870
What story do you want
your body to tell?

35:00.330 --> 35:02.200
I don't know.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.910
Maybe something
like this!

35:04.910 --> 35:07.080
(grunting)

35:07.410 --> 35:09.950
(breathing heavily)

35:09.950 --> 35:11.410
(beeping)

35:11.410 --> 35:14.120
(Rich)
"West. Route 27.
Five miles. Turn north."

35:14.120 --> 35:15.580
That must be all she
could have figured out

35:15.580 --> 35:17.160
about her location
as her vision was failing.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.740
(stammering)
So how much does
that narrow

35:18.740 --> 35:19.830
the search area?
Not enough.

35:19.830 --> 35:23.410
Briana, let's get every
agent we can out there,
all hands on deck.

35:23.410 --> 35:26.200
Iris has to own some
property out there.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.660
Like a cabin, lodge,
something.

35:27.660 --> 35:31.120
Wait, her aunt and uncle
own a vineyard out there.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.450
It's closed
for the season.

35:33.450 --> 35:35.030
Let's move.

35:46.660 --> 35:49.120
(stone clatters)

35:49.580 --> 35:50.830
(saw banging)

35:50.830 --> 35:51.780
(Iris chuckling)

35:51.780 --> 35:52.910
If you want
to play games,

35:52.910 --> 35:54.490
why don't you come
a little closer?

35:54.490 --> 35:56.910
You really think
you can stop me

35:56.910 --> 35:59.280
with that little thing?

35:59.280 --> 35:59.950
Watch me.

35:59.950 --> 36:03.200
(glass shatters,
Jane and Iris grunting)

36:16.780 --> 36:19.740
(Iris shouting,
both grunting)

36:19.740 --> 36:21.240
Unh!

36:27.410 --> 36:31.370
(helicopter overhead)

36:31.370 --> 36:33.200
Kurt...

36:48.280 --> 36:50.620
(monitors beeping softly)

36:50.620 --> 36:52.490
Hey.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.740
You still can't
see anything?

36:57.740 --> 37:01.280
No.
Just darkness.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.950
It's happening,
isn't it?

37:03.950 --> 37:06.530
What Patterson warned us
about after Tokyo.

37:06.530 --> 37:10.580
My body's starting to forget
how to function.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.370
No.
(stammering)

37:12.370 --> 37:14.910
We don't know that
that's what it is.

37:14.910 --> 37:15.740
Rich and Patterson,

37:15.740 --> 37:19.450
they're off talking
to the doctors and...

37:21.120 --> 37:24.830
...we're gonna
work this out.

37:28.950 --> 37:30.990
Can I get you
anything?

37:30.990 --> 37:31.780
No.

37:31.780 --> 37:35.620
No, just...
keep talking to me.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.870
Okay.
(chuckles)

37:37.870 --> 37:41.240
How about...
(grunting)

37:41.240 --> 37:42.620
How about I read you
something

37:42.620 --> 37:45.620
from this
really great book.

37:45.620 --> 37:48.620
"Inked to Death:
A Jane Doe Mystery."

37:48.620 --> 37:49.280
No.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.580
(both laughing)
No.

37:50.580 --> 37:52.990
Okay.
(both chuckling)

37:52.990 --> 37:55.740
That guy was wrong
about everything.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.450
Not everything.
He knew that

37:57.450 --> 37:59.530
you were gonna
take down the Ripper.
Mm.

37:59.530 --> 38:02.370
And, I guess he knew how much
we "glove" each other.

38:02.370 --> 38:04.740
(both laughing)

38:04.740 --> 38:08.030
I do "glove" you.
Mm.

38:08.030 --> 38:09.660
I do.

38:11.450 --> 38:15.700
I can't see
how worried you are...

38:15.700 --> 38:17.990
but I can feel it.

38:22.490 --> 38:24.740
Can you feel that?

38:25.200 --> 38:28.120
That's all you need
to worry about.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.160
(sighs)

38:31.240 --> 38:33.780
We've been
through worse.

38:34.830 --> 38:37.910
And we will
get through this.

38:37.910 --> 38:40.370
I promise.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.200

Your communications

38:52.200 --> 38:54.450
with Winston
were irresponsible,

38:54.450 --> 38:55.280
they were misguided,

38:55.280 --> 38:58.240
and a complete
breach of trust.
I understand.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.080
I wasn't finished,
Briana.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.160
They also
were not illegal.

39:05.160 --> 39:09.410
No actual classified
information was shared, so...

39:09.410 --> 39:11.410
Wait.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.530
So, I'm not fired?

39:17.130 --> 39:18.130
No, you're suspended.

39:18.130 --> 39:19.630
But the real punishment
begins when you get back

39:19.630 --> 39:22.010
and you have to earn the trust
of your colleagues again,

39:22.010 --> 39:23.880
which won't be easy.
Thank you.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.470
I won't
let you down again.

39:25.470 --> 39:28.760
Yeah, well, everyone
deserves a second chance.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.720
Get out of here.
Thank you.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.300
(watch beeps)

39:33.300 --> 39:38.510
W-Wait, Briana.
Question, um...

39:38.680 --> 39:40.470
You spoke to Winston
for a year,

39:40.470 --> 39:42.010
gave him details about
the entire team,

39:42.010 --> 39:45.220
but Zapata didn't show up
in the book at all.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.930
How come you didn't
tell him about her?

39:47.930 --> 39:48.800
I did.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.220
Winston said that,
as a character,

39:50.220 --> 39:54.510
Zapata was too combustible,
too self-destructive.

39:54.510 --> 39:57.430
He wanted to give the cops
in his story a happy ending,

39:57.430 --> 40:00.800
but for Zapata he just
couldn't find one.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.220
For her, or anyone
close to her.

40:06.130 --> 40:08.220
Thank you.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.970
(phone beeps)

40:41.630 --> 40:45.220
I-Is she...?
No. She had
a grand mal seizure,

40:45.220 --> 40:47.680
but she's in recovery.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.300
She's stable now.

40:49.300 --> 40:51.180
Things were a little scary
for a minute,

40:51.180 --> 40:54.130
but... she's okay.

41:02.470 --> 41:04.720
What is it, Patterson?

41:05.010 --> 41:06.800
Grand mal seizures
were listed

41:06.800 --> 41:08.970
in Dr. Roga's files.

41:08.970 --> 41:12.760
Combined with Jane's
hearing and vision loss,

41:12.760 --> 41:14.090
all signs point
to the ZIP

41:14.090 --> 41:15.970
having reached
her parietal lobe.

41:15.970 --> 41:20.180
Which means she doesn't
have much time left.

41:20.180 --> 41:22.220
How much?

41:22.220 --> 41:25.050
Weeks? Months?

41:25.930 --> 41:28.970
No.
As in, days.

41:28.970 --> 41:30.800
Maybe less.

42:25.470 --> 42:27.550
(man)
Greg, move your head.
