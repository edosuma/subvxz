00:00.800 --> 00:02.995
( door opens )

00:14.380 --> 00:16.701
( door closes )

00:16.750 --> 00:19.116
What am I going to do
about this?

00:21.180 --> 00:22.579
Huh?

00:22.620 --> 00:24.440
Tell me.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.550
Ain't nothing a little time
and elbow grease

00:27.590 --> 00:29.126
can't make right.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.458
We've been
through worse, chre.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.729
Have we?

00:50.580 --> 00:53.413
( music plays )

00:53.450 --> 00:54.849
* Dreams never die

00:54.880 --> 00:57.110
* Take flight
as the world turns *

00:57.150 --> 00:58.640
* Dreams never die

00:58.690 --> 01:01.158
* Take flight
as the world turns *

01:01.190 --> 01:02.680
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:02.730 --> 01:05.085
* Take flight

01:05.130 --> 01:07.257
* Dreams never die

01:12.640 --> 01:16.167
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:16.210 --> 01:19.236
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

01:26.580 --> 01:28.218
How'd you sleep?

01:30.890 --> 01:32.448
Good enough.

01:32.490 --> 01:33.855
Ralph:
Hey.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.778
We need to go y'all.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.424
They said it was
a hurricane.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.724
I mean, what kind
of damage can we expect?

01:39.760 --> 01:42.888
It's not unusual to get 15,
16 inches of rain

01:42.930 --> 01:44.591
this time of year.

01:44.630 --> 01:48.794
But we got 17 inches
in 24 hours.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.331
Prosper said we should
pump that off.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.873
Remy:
I told you we don't need to.

01:53.910 --> 01:55.707
I bred my cane
to withstand flooding.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.549
It's going to be fine.

01:57.580 --> 02:00.708
We fought too damn hard
to get all 200 acres planted

02:00.750 --> 02:02.889
before the storm hit
to lose it, Remy.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.617
Look, I say pump it,
just to be safe.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.356
Look, this is all talk
till we know what we're
dealing with.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.389
( soft knocking )

02:23.440 --> 02:24.668
Nova:
Hey.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.678
_ I wanted to see
If you wanted to go out.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.873
See what we can do
to repair the garden.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.618
Ain't you leaving?

02:37.650 --> 02:40.756
Can't. Roads are closed.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.849
The van is stuck.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.490
Guess you'll have to put up
with me a little longer.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.858
Aunt Vi,
you're worrying me.

02:59.610 --> 03:00.679
You okay?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.249
I'll help out.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.316
It'll feel healing to get
back into your garden.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.824
Baby, what's the point?
It's all ruined.

03:16.860 --> 03:20.318
Those plants that were ripped
from the ground can regrow.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.459
Put them back
in the dirt.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.897
They'll take root again.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.908
Okay? You'll see.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.721
Auntie Vi, you can wear
the gloves, if you want.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.024
Oh, no, baby.
You can keep them.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.869
You're doing a good job,
you know that?

03:57.900 --> 03:59.390
Yup.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.641
Yeah.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.639
I don't know why my mom
said those things to you
last night.

04:17.650 --> 04:20.483
We said some pretty hurtful
things to each other.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.756
Micah:
If it's still cool,
I would like to stay with you

04:25.790 --> 04:27.894
when I start school.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.898
If it's okay with you.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.898
Baby, I would love
nothing more.

04:31.930 --> 04:34.364
But it's up
to your mama.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.436
But I'm the one
gorng to school.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.609
She just wants
what's best for you.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.804
Everything was doing so well.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.045
Nova:
It'll all grow back, Aunt Vi.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.745
Remy:
Hey, this looks pretty good.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.041
Ralph:
Seriously?

04:52.090 --> 04:54.388
Yeah. It's honestly
going to be fine.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.854
I was expecting more
flooding than this.

04:56.890 --> 04:59.051
Ralph:
What if it rain again, Remy?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.297
Remy:
Then we'll see what
that looks like.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.024
What about the new cane?

05:04.070 --> 05:05.822
There's pools of water
everywhere.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.896
Look, if harvest
were this week,

05:08.940 --> 05:10.908
with all this mud,
we'd be in trouble

05:10.940 --> 05:12.669
trying to get tractors
and trucks in here.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.974
But there's hardly
any water on the cane.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.807
Yeah, thank God.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.039
I guess.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.391
What?

05:32.430 --> 05:33.829
Is...?

05:33.860 --> 05:35.088
( flies buzzing )

05:35.130 --> 05:36.893
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

05:36.930 --> 05:38.727
Yo, what?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.128
Remy:
Oh, no. No, no.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.638
Charley:
Who are they?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.601
Deputy:
So, you're the last owner

06:22.650 --> 06:24.641
we haven't spoken to,
Miss Bordelon.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.148
Charley:
You know what
the motive was?

06:27.180 --> 06:30.047
Deputy:
Seeing as they didn't have
any valuables or wallets--

06:30.090 --> 06:32.456
Baby, what you doing
back here?

06:34.790 --> 06:36.109
I'm just trying to--

06:36.160 --> 06:38.583
That's got nothing to do
with you, Ralph Angel.

06:38.630 --> 06:41.656
You should be out there
talking to the deputy.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.962
You might have something

06:43.000 --> 06:44.661
that can help them
catch whoever did this.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.531
No, I don't know anything.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.162
I don't know nothing.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.634
So, what you going to do?

06:51.670 --> 06:53.934
Run every time
you see the law?

06:53.980 --> 06:55.675
Huh?

06:59.110 --> 07:01.840
You don't know how it is.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.786
They're going
to ask for you.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.984
Sitting back here makes it
look like you got something
to hide.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.552
So come on.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.865
Ralph Angel...

07:27.980 --> 07:30.107
( indistinct chatter )

07:30.150 --> 07:33.916
Remy:
...in enough time
to get home safely.

07:33.950 --> 07:37.545
Deputy:
So, they were still
out there working

07:37.590 --> 07:39.649
with the storm bearing down
on the parish?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.850
Yes.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.529
Hmm.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.096
Deputy, I already gave
my statement to the sheriff

07:49.130 --> 07:50.825
back at the farm.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.169
Well, two men are dead,
Mrs. West.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.862
They had plenty of time
to get to cover.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.036
Deputy:
Mm-hm.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.503
So, just to confirm,

07:59.540 --> 08:02.179
you recognized
the two victims, correct?

08:02.210 --> 08:05.509
They both worked
on the farm.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.074
Deputy:
And the two dead men,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.782
what were their names?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.663
I-- uh--

08:24.700 --> 08:27.134
I guess their names
slipped my mind.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.899
I'm sorry.

08:32.910 --> 08:36.004
Miss Bordelon,
did you know
the men's names?

08:36.040 --> 08:37.905
I'm sorry.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.679
I don't.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.281
Deputy:
Look, it's not
a big deal, y'all.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.914
We'll fingerprint them,
see what comes up.

08:45.950 --> 08:46.814
So that's it?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.782
- ( cell phone vibrates )
- For now.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.056
Excuse me.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.553
Leland.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.693
Deputy: Mm-hm.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.631
( horn honks )

09:09.210 --> 09:10.677
Got it?

09:10.710 --> 09:12.302
This should be heating.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.648
( upbeat music plays
over truck radio )

09:22.320 --> 09:23.924
Boogie, boy.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.793
What you doing
around these parts?

09:26.830 --> 09:29.958
Well, we came through
the storm in good shape,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.321
so Keke and me_ said
we were gonna ride by,
see about y'all.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.065
What's going on here?

09:34.100 --> 09:36.091
Hollywood:
Yeah, yeah,
that ain't for us.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.132
Couple of guys got killed
over at Ernest's property.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.808
Vi's niece found them.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.149
- You lying.
- Wish I was.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.977
Keke.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.170
Hey.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.313
Hey, Blue.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.272
Hi.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.208
Blue, you growing faster
than a cane stalk.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.615
I need you to stop.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.013
( laughs )

10:00.860 --> 10:02.725
You better put a hat on
before you catch heatstroke.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.989
That boy from California.
He all right.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.361
What, they don't have
caps in California?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.231
Well...

10:09.270 --> 10:10.999
Violet: _
Hey, Boogie!

10:11.040 --> 10:13.099
Hey, Keke.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.630
- Vi.
- Miss Violet.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.136
Violet:
I see you met Micah.

10:17.980 --> 10:19.948
I got friends
that follow you on IG.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.709
Really?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.980
You looked taller
In pictures.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.147
( laughs )

10:26.190 --> 10:27.418
Um...

10:27.460 --> 10:29.257
- ( laughing )
- Violet: Keke, baby.

10:29.290 --> 10:32.020
Come on.
Help me with my garden.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.260
Over here, Boog.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.426
Come on, Micah.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.233
Keep your eyes
to yourself, boy.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.396
-(laughs)
- Hey, yeah.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.908
You tell him again.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.775
So, you back in the Ninth?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.103
You go by my house?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.674
And everyone else
make it okay?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.414
( sighs )

10:58.450 --> 11:00.987
No, I do not know
when the roads will reopen.

11:01.020 --> 11:04.387
Actually, something's up.
Sheriff's at my auntie's house.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.352
I'll talk to you
about it later.

11:06.390 --> 11:09.154
Yeah, okay.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.792
Bye, Chantal.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.389
Deputy Conroe.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.135
Before you leave,
I'm curious.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.333
Y'all have this kind of thing
happen around here often?

11:19.370 --> 11:22.339
Deputy:
Ain't too many
homicides in St. Jo.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.870
It ain't like the big city.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.775
So you are going
to talk to the folk

11:25.810 --> 11:27.949
in the migrant community
about what happened.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.813
Look, we get our share
of petty crime,

11:30.850 --> 11:33.182
we hear about some robberies
now and then.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.858
A large percentage
of the migrant workers,

11:34.890 --> 11:36.926
they get paid in cash.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.450
And since they don't bank,
they're like walking ATMs.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.948
- Are you writing
something on this?
- I'm a reporter. Habit.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.719
Just to be clear, I ain't
accusing y'all of having
undocumented workers,

11:44.770 --> 11:46.931
_ but I have an uncle
In the sugarcane busrness

11:46.970 --> 11:48.790
and from what I hear,
the government is making it

11:48.840 --> 11:50.967
really hard to hire
guest workers.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.379
Think you'll catch
who did it?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.145
Maybe.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.978
We'll do what
we can to find them.
It's a heinous crime.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.113
Nobody deserves
to get killed for
a little bit of money.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.116
But...?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.082
Hell.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.223
We can't help those people
if they don't talk to us.

12:13.260 --> 12:16.093
Sounds like there's
a lack of trust there.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.768
Listen, we're just
trying to do our jobs.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.529
If they don't trust us,
it's on them.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.333
Right.

12:26.170 --> 12:27.376
You have a good day.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.139
Yeah.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.000
You, too.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.795
Darla: Do you got any fives?
Blue: Go fish.

12:46.830 --> 12:50.027
Darla:
"Go fish" again?

12:50.070 --> 12:53.938
Blue:
My turn?
What about sevens?

12:57.570 --> 13:00.004
What is she
still doing here?

13:03.010 --> 13:04.546
Roads are still blocked.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.912
She can't go nowhere,
and you know it.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.220
Y'all didn't know
the names of the workers
that were killed?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.927
Nah.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.194
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

13:30.470 --> 13:34.372
Aunt Vi, you real selective
with your sympathies.

13:34.410 --> 13:35.536
( scoffs )

13:35.580 --> 13:37.548
( drops spoon )

13:46.250 --> 13:47.581
( turns hose off)

13:49.890 --> 13:52.927
So are you really friends
with Jaden Smith?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.394
Yeah, we...

13:55.430 --> 13:57.295
our parents know each other.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.560
Hmm.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.206
What, you got a crush
on him or something?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.259
- No.
-(laughs)

14:06.310 --> 14:07.572
( gunshot)

14:07.610 --> 14:09.305
- What the hell was that?
-(laughs)

14:09.340 --> 14:11.479
It's deer season.

14:11.510 --> 14:15.014
Thirty-aught-six
hunting rifle.
About a mile off.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.115
You ever shot a gun before?

14:20.620 --> 14:22.508
Of course I have.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.989
Paintballs don't count.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.918
( laughs )

14:31.300 --> 14:32.961
Jokes.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.602
Nova:
Charley.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.875
Hey.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.312
You okay?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.123
Hey.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.664
How could I not
know their names?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.473
- They worked for me.
- They worked for us.

15:14.510 --> 15:15.977
No.

15:19.050 --> 15:21.678
I forced them to keep working
before the storm hit.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.081
If they had left sooner,
then".

15:27.390 --> 15:29.119
maybe they'd be alive
right now.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.650
You ain't God.

15:30.690 --> 15:35.354
When your number is called,
ain't no stopping that.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.699
You said it yourself.

15:40.740 --> 15:44.961
What we're doing here is...
it's like slavery, right?

15:47.210 --> 15:49.235
Replacing the black
with the brown.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.977
I say a lot of things.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.984
- What about Daddy?
- Nova: Charley, don't do that.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.454
Don't put the blame
on yourself.

16:04.490 --> 16:05.718
He tried.

16:07.160 --> 16:10.095
He tried to get me
to come back and help.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.329
I wouldn't listen.

16:18.470 --> 16:20.074
I used to be
a good person.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.134
Come on, now.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.400
You're not a bad person.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.270
You have no idea.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.786
You remember that woman?

16:33.820 --> 16:36.618
That prostitute
that Davis was seeing?

16:36.660 --> 16:38.628
Of course.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.062
I leaked her name
to the press.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.434
And Davis's teammates...

16:49.670 --> 16:51.228
they did rape her.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.346
And I ruined her life.

16:57.380 --> 16:58.677
For what?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.250
You know, I wanted
to ruin her life

17:09.290 --> 17:11.224
like she ruined mine.

17:13.830 --> 17:16.424
What kind of a person
does that?

17:18.600 --> 17:20.739
You had a card to play...

17:23.570 --> 17:25.663
and you played it.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.552
So, you surf?

17:45.590 --> 17:47.854
Oh, my God.
Why does everybody here
ask me that?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.165
Because you a California boy.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.339
And I know
you don't shoot.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.434
Um...

17:57.470 --> 18:00.473
yeah, I used to go
to surf camp when
I was a kid.

18:00.510 --> 18:01.670
See?

18:01.710 --> 18:04.406
( laughs )
I knew it.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.304
Surf camp?

18:06.350 --> 18:07.840
Where that at, Malibu?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.313
Malibu, yeah.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.410
So you got yourself
a Malibu girlfriend too?

18:16.620 --> 18:18.588
Nope, not anymore.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.319
Y'all just broke up?

18:23.500 --> 18:24.660
Yeah.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.396
This past month
has really sucked.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.668
Big time.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.258
( horn honks )

18:30.310 --> 18:33.302
Boogie:
Keke, let's get a move on.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.543
Gots to go.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.549
Yeah.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.782
Hey, um...

18:44.820 --> 18:48.483
it was really cool
hanging out with you.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.149
You're just happy
you had help cleaning
your auntie's garden.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.350
( laughs )
No.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.551
Well, it's not
done yet, so...

18:59.500 --> 19:02.469
Yeah, well, that's all
the free help you
going to get.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.832
Boogie's got his
scrap metal.

19:04.870 --> 19:07.600
You won't see me
unless you want to.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.138
- What?
- ( both laugh )

19:19.550 --> 19:21.654
Follow me on IG.

19:21.690 --> 19:22.884
@Keketwirl.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.627
"Keketwirl,"
like one word?

19:25.660 --> 19:27.252
Two together.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.528
( Micah laughs)

19:28.560 --> 19:30.289
- I got you.
- Just "Keketwirl."

19:30.330 --> 19:31.866
- Keketwirl.
- Got it?

19:31.900 --> 19:34.733
Okay. Bye, "Cali boy."

19:34.770 --> 19:36.397
Bye.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.779
Boogie:
All right,
let's get out of here.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.539
( engine starts )

19:48.580 --> 19:52.584
* And I_ will follow
where thIs takes me *

19:55.590 --> 20:00.527
* In a world uncertain,
say you'll be my stone *

20:04.270 --> 20:06.568
Vi. Vi, get down.
I got this. I got this.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.831
No, Hollywood, you been
going 90 miles an hour
all day.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.337
You ain't hardly
stopped to rest.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.701
- I'm fine.
- I'm okay. I got it.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.401
Sit. Just sit down.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.447
Woman, sit down, please.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.319
Ralph Angel's
still pressuring me

20:35.360 --> 20:37.396
to sign them
guardianship papers.

20:37.430 --> 20:40.729
And look what would have
happened ifI had.

20:40.770 --> 20:42.863
Darla waltzing in here,

20:42.900 --> 20:46.802
trying to mess
that child up again.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.705
No way I'm signing them now.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.378
I just won't.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.541
And I know something's going on
between the two of them.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.309
I can feel it.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.614
But if Ralph Angel

20:58.650 --> 21:01.380
want to go on back to Darla
after what she did,

21:02.720 --> 21:04.927
But as far as I see it,

21:04.960 --> 21:07.599
I was right not to sign
them papers

21:07.630 --> 21:09.825
if that's how
it's going to be.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.597
Now you know
I'm right about that.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.538
No, Vi.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.538
You wrong.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.904
Look, it ain't Blue
you're struggling with,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.975
trying to let go.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.911
Ralph Angel ain't
your baby boy no more.

21:31.850 --> 21:35.616
Now, I'm gonna tell you
this one the last time.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.720
You're going to have to
let him live his life.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.900
Ralph:
Appreciate it.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.771
How well you know
them, Ralph?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.117
Ignacio and Arturo?

22:03.150 --> 22:05.414
Ain't like we're friends,

22:05.450 --> 22:07.611
but I know they work hard.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.849
Nova:
At least you know
their names.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.388
I'm thinking about
talking to them.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.965
Learning more about
the men who died

22:21.000 --> 22:22.968
and where they came from.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.002
Like a story?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.803
Maybe.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.808
Ralph:
Shit, Nova.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.946
They don't even know yet.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.845
Ain't nobody told them.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.576
You got to be kidding.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.781
No. No.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.725
What's going on?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.557
We need to tell them
about their friends.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.864
They-- They have no idea
what happened.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.866
Charley,
you speak Spanish,
right?

22:56.900 --> 22:59.505
Well, barely.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.531
I mean, I can't give them
this news in broken Spanish.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.777
They'll have questions.
I won't be able to answer them.

23:07.050 --> 23:08.870
I know somebody who can.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.566
( speaking Spanish )

23:29.000 --> 23:30.661
What'd he say?

23:30.710 --> 23:33.201
He thinks you've
invited him to your home

23:33.240 --> 23:35.936
because you're not happy
with his work.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.514
Maybe we should just wait.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.689
We need to just
tell them.

23:45.950 --> 23:48.089
Your...

23:48.120 --> 23:52.682
Your friends,
Miguel and Alejandro,

23:52.730 --> 23:55.858
We think when they
cut across the field

23:55.900 --> 24:00.564
to go off to the next farm
in order to catch the bus...

24:03.140 --> 24:05.802
somebody robbed...

24:05.840 --> 24:07.535
and killed them.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.832
The sheriffs
are looking into it.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.478
( Reyna translates
in Spanish )

24:25.290 --> 24:27.087
( speaking Spanish )

24:29.300 --> 24:31.461
No, no, no.

24:41.910 --> 24:45.073
We're very, very sorry.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.812
( speaking Spanish )

25:00.600 --> 25:02.921
We would like to know more
about these men.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.031
Did they have children?
Where were they from?

25:11.910 --> 25:13.901
( speaks Spanish )

25:25.320 --> 25:27.515
( speaks Spanish )

25:58.820 --> 26:00.856
Reyna:
Miguel was married...

26:02.690 --> 26:06.057
and was a father of three.

26:06.090 --> 26:07.318
Alejandro just got married,

26:07.360 --> 26:10.090
and was expecting
his first child.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.588
A boy.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.033
Can you tell them
I'm a journalist...

26:23.910 --> 26:26.799
and I would like to write
a story about your friends.

26:26.850 --> 26:29.011
And if it's okay
ifI record

26:29.050 --> 26:31.939
what they're saying
about Miguel and Alejandro?

26:35.290 --> 26:37.110
( translates in Spanish )

26:49.340 --> 26:51.069
Man:
S.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.930
Man #2:
S.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.734
( sighs )

26:55.780 --> 26:57.873
( speaking Spanish )

27:12.330 --> 27:14.628
( Spanish continues )

27:33.080 --> 27:34.411
They were brothers.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.247
Uncles.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.713
Fathers.

27:39.190 --> 27:43.752
They didn't make
these sacrifices
for citizenship.

27:43.790 --> 27:47.419
There's no path for that
when you're a guest worker.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.099
They did it to give
their family a better life.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.139
( speaks Spanish )

28:07.050 --> 28:09.109
They'd like to pray
for their friends.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.151
( sniffles )

28:19.230 --> 28:21.095
( praying in Spanish )

28:46.820 --> 28:51.086
I appreciate the call,
Deputy.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.257
No, really, really.
Thank you.

28:54.430 --> 28:57.149
Okay. Bye.

28:58.130 --> 29:00.098
Well, what'd he say?

29:00.130 --> 29:01.836
The sheriff
arrested someone.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.394
VVho?

29:03.440 --> 29:07.262
Meth addict
tryIng to score.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.438
Oh, my God.
How senseless.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.402
He had a gun that matched
the murder weapon

29:12.450 --> 29:15.271
and he had
Alejandro's ID card on him.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.111
I want Miguel
and Alejandro's remains

29:21.160 --> 29:22.889
returned to their families.

29:24.290 --> 29:25.848
That's not going
to be easy.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.893
It's going to cost
a whole lot of money, too.

29:28.930 --> 29:30.750
I don't care.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.439
It's the right thing to do.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.398
- ( door opens )
- Nova: Aunt Vi?

29:44.580 --> 29:46.445
Yeah, baby?

29:48.180 --> 29:49.772
You all right?

29:51.090 --> 29:52.785
I will be.

29:54.420 --> 29:57.514
Time takes care
of just about everything.

29:59.390 --> 30:01.449
Like all that water
that fell last night.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.299
you need to let that
wash on away from here.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.963
And I feel like
maybe you're putting

30:09.000 --> 30:11.036
_too much time
Into Hollywood,

30:11.070 --> 30:13.834
and Blue,
and Ralph Angel.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.842
Maybe you need to put
some more time into you.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.274
What you talking about?

30:22.320 --> 30:25.141
They can't hold
all you got to give.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.146
Not because
they bad folk,

30:27.190 --> 30:30.318
but because they were
never meant to hold it.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.290
You got to put that weight
where it's meant to be.

30:36.630 --> 30:37.995
And where is that?

30:38.030 --> 30:39.964
Inside your purpose.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.399
My purpose?

30:41.440 --> 30:42.532
( laughs )

30:42.570 --> 30:43.901
God.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.908
Shoot, Nova,

30:45.940 --> 30:49.205
when I was growing up,

30:49.240 --> 30:51.549
caring for the folks
you care about

30:51.580 --> 30:52.877
was your purpose.

30:52.910 --> 30:54.343
Your be-all and end-all.

30:54.380 --> 30:58.612
And we felt satisﬁed
to be able to do that.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.208
Yeah.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.979
And I respect that.

31:08.130 --> 31:10.291
This your time, Aunt Vi.

31:12.970 --> 31:14.995
Take it.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.095
I could watch him
all night.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.020
How he breathes
up and down.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.531
So precious.

31:53.070 --> 31:56.005
- I know it sounds stupid.
- Ralph: No, it don't.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.248
Blue will do that to you.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.271
Little things about him

32:01.320 --> 32:03.413
make you just want
to fight the whole world

32:03.450 --> 32:05.918
just so he won't have to.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.493
Thank you.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.698
For what?

32:25.740 --> 32:28.277
Everything.

32:28.310 --> 32:29.572
Today.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.578
Yesterday.

32:32.710 --> 32:34.644
Keeping me out
of the storm.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.611
For what you said
to Violet.

32:40.790 --> 32:43.315
For a whole day with Blue.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.055
Especially that.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.593
Every day's a good day
with Blue.

32:49.630 --> 32:52.190
( laughs )

32:52.230 --> 32:54.198
I got to admit, though,

32:54.240 --> 32:57.334
I am more tired
after one day with him

32:57.370 --> 32:59.008
than I am at the end
of a whole work week.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.632
( both laugh )

33:01.540 --> 33:03.735
He don't stop, do he?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.645
That boy can go.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.418
I wish I could
see hIm more.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.187
I really do.

33:19.260 --> 33:21.421
Do you think I could?

33:25.530 --> 33:27.521
You got a car seat?

33:29.240 --> 33:30.764
No, but I could get one.

33:32.770 --> 33:35.170
But the size, or...?

33:35.210 --> 33:37.132
- I'll take care of it.
-(laughs)

33:37.180 --> 33:39.740
It's a booster.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.270
It's real simple.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.209
But I'll show you
how to use it.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.515
I would like that.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.628
Yeah, we could work
something out.

33:55.660 --> 33:56.695
( sighs )

33:56.730 --> 33:59.164
You know it's not going
to be all the time, Darla,

33:59.200 --> 34:01.532
but...

34:01.570 --> 34:04.038
we can work
something out.

34:11.110 --> 34:15.217
Would you mind giving me
a ride back to the farm

34:15.250 --> 34:16.740
so I can get my car?

34:18.450 --> 34:20.179
If you're not
too tired?

34:23.890 --> 34:26.051
No.

34:27.260 --> 34:28.796
Okay.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.232
I'm off.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.319
( sighs )

35:26.320 --> 35:27.878
Thank you, Remy...

35:27.920 --> 35:29.717
for everything.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.289
For all the work
on the farm.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.360
Well, I told you
we'd be all right.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.220
Mm-hm.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.464
You know,

35:41.500 --> 35:44.867
from now on,
whatever you say,

35:44.910 --> 35:46.400
I say, "Yes, sir."

35:46.440 --> 35:48.635
( laughs )

35:52.680 --> 35:54.545
Now you know you ain't
never said "Yes, sir"

35:54.580 --> 35:56.673
to nobody not a day
in your life.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.317
You're right, I haven't.

36:00.350 --> 36:01.817
( both laugh )

36:06.930 --> 36:09.148
Remy:
Oh, boy.

36:13.330 --> 36:17.437
Well, we're not totally
out of the woods yet.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.199
What do you mean?

36:19.240 --> 36:21.629
Well, because sometimes
water and humidity

36:21.680 --> 36:26.276
can add up to borers
and whitefly.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.286
We'll still need to keep
a close eye on the crop.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.510
So last night...

36:34.560 --> 36:36.858
You don't need
to say anything.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.465
What if somebody sees?

36:50.500 --> 36:52.866
Everybody around here
is grown.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.607
Including us.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.901
Let them see
if they want to look.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.745
And what will they see
if they do look?

37:09.960 --> 37:12.827
A good man telling
an extraordinary woman

37:12.860 --> 37:16.352
that he don't want
to be her friend.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.793
That ain't enough.

37:23.840 --> 37:27.503
Things are so complicated
right now.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.236
They were for me
for a long time, too.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.676
They're becoming
less so every day.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.956
And I think
that's your fault.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.636
So...

37:57.670 --> 37:59.535
you know where I am.

37:59.570 --> 38:02.300
And you know
where I live.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.999
I'm here when you're ready.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.965
( car door opens
and closes )

38:33.710 --> 38:35.701
( car engine starts )

38:40.810 --> 38:44.689
* I've been loving you *

38:44.720 --> 38:46.915
* Too long

38:49.490 --> 38:51.981
* I've been loving you *

38:52.030 --> 38:53.452
* For...

38:55.860 --> 38:58.363
( music plays )
