00:48.146 --> 00:49.281
Hi.

00:51.249 --> 00:53.250
Hi.

00:53.252 --> 00:56.385
I'm here for the, uh,
the online management position.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.622
Okay.

00:58.624 --> 01:00.126
Yes.

01:02.995 --> 01:06.263
Cool, man.
Uh, let's go. Alright?

01:06.265 --> 01:10.837
Um, how do you see
music's impact on social media?

01:13.104 --> 01:15.240
Music's impact on social media.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.108
Uh, well, wouldn't that be

01:19.110 --> 01:22.916
uh, social media's impact
on... on music?

01:24.550 --> 01:26.485
It works both ways.

01:29.187 --> 01:31.056
Well, uh...

01:33.791 --> 01:36.628
When somebody shares a song
on, uh, Facebook...

01:38.731 --> 01:41.467
...you know, that would change
its, uh...

01:42.700 --> 01:45.769
...it would change
its analytics.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.170
Like, if someone
is... is... is sharing a song

01:48.172 --> 01:51.540
then the, uh, the users,
or... or rather Facebook

01:51.542 --> 01:55.846
would, um, be changing
its format

01:55.848 --> 02:00.117
you know, to be, uh,
more... more music oriented.

02:00.119 --> 02:01.885
Mm, no.

02:03.321 --> 02:05.688
But that...
that was a cool answer.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.958
Cool. I like it. But, no.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.631
Like, let's take for example
the acronym YOLO.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.136
- YOLO?
- YOLO.

02:19.003 --> 02:21.370
YOLO, you only live once.

02:21.372 --> 02:23.606
Hashtag YOLO from Drake's song.

02:23.608 --> 02:25.642
I mean,
people were emailing YOLO

02:25.644 --> 02:26.942
signing off texts with it.

02:26.944 --> 02:30.112
Its proliferation
on social media was so voracious

02:30.114 --> 02:33.016
that suddenly
the meanin' flipped.

02:33.018 --> 02:36.118
Instead of representing
cool people and cool events

02:36.120 --> 02:39.456
it was suddenly hashtagged
by stupid people, stupid events

02:39.458 --> 02:40.589
and it was, like, oh, my God.

02:40.591 --> 02:43.493
Why are old people
using YOLO?

02:43.495 --> 02:46.196
I did not mean
that to be rude or offensive...

02:46.198 --> 02:47.763
- Oh, no, no, no.
- In any way.

02:47.765 --> 02:49.933
I love everyone no matter
what age they were born.

02:49.935 --> 02:51.167
We're all equal.

02:51.169 --> 02:53.202
And you can choose
what gender you wanna be.

02:53.204 --> 02:56.273
So that's excitin'.

02:56.275 --> 02:59.176
Um, there are a lot
of young people workin' here

02:59.178 --> 03:01.878
so what is...

03:01.880 --> 03:05.548
Like, you could bring something
unique and cool to this.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.083
What is that?

03:07.085 --> 03:09.486
I bring a very deep knowledge
and love of music.

03:09.488 --> 03:12.122
Ah, I love music too.

03:12.124 --> 03:14.857
They all love music,
like, what is...

03:14.859 --> 03:17.226
I... I'm talking about,
like, what unique thing

03:17.228 --> 03:19.164
do you bring to the table?

03:22.835 --> 03:24.170
Uh...

03:26.305 --> 03:28.404
Look, all I know is that
when I was 11 years old

03:28.406 --> 03:30.540
I heard Led Zeppelin IV

03:30.542 --> 03:32.676
and it blew my mind.

03:32.678 --> 03:35.077
I never heard music
like that before.

03:35.079 --> 03:37.947
I didn't even know music
like that was possible.

03:37.949 --> 03:40.816
And so I caught the fever,
and what I wanna do

03:40.818 --> 03:43.587
is pass that fever
down to the next generation.

03:43.589 --> 03:48.225
Yeah. That is so true.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.126
I love that, Leonard.
I mean...

03:50.128 --> 03:52.229
Like, who, who is

03:52.231 --> 03:54.167
who is the new Led Zeppelin?

03:56.033 --> 03:57.801
- The new Led Zeppelin?
- Yes.

03:57.803 --> 04:00.303
Like, what new artist
are you digging right now?

04:00.305 --> 04:01.574
Like...

04:15.721 --> 04:17.586
DriverX?

04:17.588 --> 04:19.524
No, I got my own car.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.541
- Am I alive?
- Yes.

04:36.941 --> 04:38.374
Am I part of the animal kingdom?

04:38.376 --> 04:39.612
Yes.

04:41.013 --> 04:43.345
- Am I a pet?
- No.

04:58.429 --> 05:00.797
Boys have it pretty lucky,
don't they, dad?

05:00.799 --> 05:01.831
What do you mean, honey?

05:01.833 --> 05:04.066
Because they don't have
to be smart.

05:04.068 --> 05:07.039
They don't have to get jobs.
They just have to get married.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.141
- Hi.
- How was work?

05:11.143 --> 05:13.944
Oh, God.
I am so over this job.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.444
I mean, I'm glad I
have one and everything

05:15.446 --> 05:18.547
it's just my boss, oh, my God.

05:18.549 --> 05:20.449
Am I being a bitch
if I can't stand up

05:20.451 --> 05:22.919
when someone asks for something

05:22.921 --> 05:25.792
that isn't supposed to be
a question but a command?

05:27.426 --> 05:28.859
He's always like,
"W... Would you, uh

05:28.861 --> 05:30.259
mind answering the phone,
please?"

05:30.261 --> 05:31.460
Instead of just
answer the phone.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.696
Have some balls
and say what you want.

05:33.698 --> 05:34.833
Own it.

05:35.967 --> 05:38.835
- Right.
- Am I being a bitch?

05:38.837 --> 05:40.470
No. No, of course not.

05:40.472 --> 05:41.804
"Star Wars!"

05:41.806 --> 05:44.708
- Oh, is that you?
- Yes.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.175
- Is that what you want?
- Mm-hmm.

05:46.177 --> 05:47.544
- Are you my Jedi Knight?
- Yes!

05:47.546 --> 05:49.916
Oh, you are. I thought so.

05:53.184 --> 05:54.650
How did
the Pop Fizz interview go?

05:54.652 --> 05:56.319
Hard to say.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.254
You know, good, I think.

05:58.256 --> 06:00.122
<i>I'm twice as old
as everybody there.</i>

06:00.124 --> 06:01.557
I really don't know
if I'd be a good fit.

06:01.559 --> 06:03.259
You know what though, they...
they need people like you.

06:03.261 --> 06:04.960
They need someone
who's been around the block.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.429
Yeah, tell them that.

06:07.431 --> 06:08.598
Do you think you have a chance?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.833
- Mom.
- A chance? Yeah, yeah, sure.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.102
- Okay.
- Mom, I made this for you.

06:13.104 --> 06:17.139
You did? Oh, it smells divine.

06:17.141 --> 06:20.112
<i>Thank you so much, sweetheart.</i>

06:23.482 --> 06:25.514
<i>Okay, I want you to eat 3 more
beans and you guys can go.</i>

06:25.516 --> 06:27.117
- <i>I don't like them.</i>
- Oh, come on.

06:27.119 --> 06:28.718
Eat a couple of pieces
and we'll get outta here.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.153
Okay.

06:30.155 --> 06:34.290
So I'm starting
a juice cleanse on Monday.

06:34.292 --> 06:36.059
But 2 days before

06:36.061 --> 06:38.561
I'm gonna eat nothing
except raw foods.

06:38.563 --> 06:41.564
Just salads, vegetables.

06:41.566 --> 06:44.266
- Forty-eight hours.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

06:44.268 --> 06:46.869
Six meals, eight snacks.

06:46.871 --> 06:49.838
Mm-hmm, you should do it.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.141
Yeah.
I can't keep eating like this.

06:54.345 --> 06:56.211
- Okay. That's good.
- There you go.

06:56.213 --> 06:57.646
Five minutes,
then it's bath time.

06:57.648 --> 06:59.915
- Okay.
- Five.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.923
I need to talk to you.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.357
About what?

07:08.359 --> 07:10.893
- We're out of money.
- What do you mean?

07:10.895 --> 07:13.965
Property tax is due and...

07:15.566 --> 07:17.537
...I don't know
how I'm gonna pay for it.

07:20.272 --> 07:21.670
We'll take it out
of the savings.

07:21.672 --> 07:22.941
What savings?

07:24.575 --> 07:25.842
Well, I thought with Emma going
to kindergarten...

07:25.844 --> 07:27.276
We're not paying
for Pre-K anymore

07:27.278 --> 07:29.045
but if nothing is coming in
on your part

07:29.047 --> 07:30.713
it's just, we're...

07:35.020 --> 07:37.754
Get a job. Any job.

07:37.756 --> 07:39.588
You know I can't work
at Starbucks.

07:39.590 --> 07:42.694
- It would be the death of me.
- I'm not asking you to do that.

07:46.832 --> 07:48.965
How much is it?

07:48.967 --> 07:51.237
Well, it comes to about 10,000.

07:54.338 --> 07:55.437
- We could sell the house.
- No, no.

07:55.439 --> 07:57.342
- We're not selling the house.
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:59.143 --> 08:01.910
Look, I'm almost done
digitizing the CD

08:01.912 --> 08:04.347
and record collection
from the store. The primo stuff.

08:04.349 --> 08:05.782
<i>I'm sure I can get around
that much.</i>

08:05.784 --> 08:06.982
You sure?

08:06.984 --> 08:09.485
Honey, the collection
is worth at least 15.

08:09.487 --> 08:11.453
I... I'm talking everything.
You know, the posters

08:11.455 --> 08:13.523
the LPs, the CDs,
all the best stuff.

08:13.525 --> 08:15.124
Whatever.
Uh, money's due in 3 weeks.

08:15.126 --> 08:17.295
Okay. I got it.

08:18.797 --> 08:19.795
Okay.

08:19.797 --> 08:21.196
In the meantime

08:21.198 --> 08:23.365
let's get rid of Jose.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.934
- You're gonna cut the grass?
- Yeah.

08:25.936 --> 08:28.638
What, my old man used to do it.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.639
No, no, no. I... I'm sorry.

08:30.641 --> 08:33.275
When did we become the kind of
people who needed a gardener

08:33.277 --> 08:35.410
or... or... or a pool man,
for that matter?

08:35.413 --> 08:39.448
Oh-oh. So you're gonna get rid
of Rob, too.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.351
Middle class people
like you and me

08:41.352 --> 08:42.885
used to do
all of this sort of stuff.

08:42.888 --> 08:45.155
Well, so,
just so I'm clear though

08:45.157 --> 08:48.357
so... so you're,
you're gonna cut the grass

08:48.359 --> 08:50.226
and clean the pool?

08:50.228 --> 08:51.761
- Yeah.
- Mm.

08:51.763 --> 08:53.929
Anything that I don't know
how to do, I'll google it.

08:53.931 --> 08:55.901
That's how I fixed
the dishwasher last month.

09:40.311 --> 09:41.446
Fuck.

09:51.856 --> 09:55.224
We're going through some tough
financial times and...

10:27.425 --> 10:30.260
<i>Hello. How was school, ladies?</i>

10:30.262 --> 10:31.660
- Good.
- Good.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.729
<i>Tell me
what did you learn today?</i>

10:33.731 --> 10:37.132
<i>Did you know that blind people
can still see by using echoes?</i>

10:37.134 --> 10:38.300
- <i>Echoes?</i>
- Yes.

10:38.302 --> 10:39.868
They click their tongues
like this.

10:41.406 --> 10:42.805
<i>Oh.</i>

10:42.807 --> 10:44.841
<i>Hey, so what did you learn,
Emma?</i>

10:44.843 --> 10:47.609
I learned about animals.

10:47.611 --> 10:49.212
<i>What'd you learn about animals?</i>

10:49.214 --> 10:51.981
We have to save the tigers.

10:51.983 --> 10:53.415
<i>The tigers?</i>

10:53.417 --> 10:55.785
<i>Yeah.
They're almost all dead.</i>

10:55.787 --> 10:56.888
<i>Oh.</i>

11:03.094 --> 11:04.129
Hey.

11:05.363 --> 11:07.697
So, what's the tally?

11:07.699 --> 11:09.902
I'll give you 800 for this.

11:13.738 --> 11:15.007
What?

11:16.474 --> 11:18.440
W... what are you talking about?
What about all this?

11:18.442 --> 11:20.742
That's worthless.

11:20.744 --> 11:23.112
I mean, I can move it
on to places like VA Hospitals

11:23.114 --> 11:25.147
and retirement homes.

11:25.149 --> 11:27.717
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.719
Um, what about this?

11:30.721 --> 11:33.122
I know,
that Eyeless In Gaza CD

11:33.124 --> 11:35.123
is an import
in pristine condition.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.793
- Yes.
- Magnificent music.

11:36.795 --> 11:38.664
- Exactly.
- Nobody cares.

11:40.798 --> 11:42.265
You're wrong.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.601
Dude, these are coasters.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.368
Okay, you don't seem
to understand.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.871
See, I want to move
this music along.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.975
You know, I wanted somebody else
to be able to discover it.

12:01.319 --> 12:03.352
Look.

12:03.354 --> 12:05.655
Your girls are really cute
and they're well behaved.

12:05.657 --> 12:07.593
I'll give you 850.

12:21.239 --> 12:22.438
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:22.440 --> 12:25.607
Come on, girls, sit down.
It's dinnertime.

12:25.609 --> 12:27.843
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:27.845 --> 12:29.782
- How'd it go?
- Well...

12:31.682 --> 12:35.351
Turns out young people aren't
buying CDs and records anymore.

12:35.353 --> 12:37.523
It's a lesson I've had to learn
the hard way twice now.

12:40.992 --> 12:42.125
- <i>Mommy.</i>
- I'll fix this.

12:42.127 --> 12:44.626
Look at you ladies.

12:44.628 --> 12:47.597
- Hello. How was your day?
- Hi. Good.

12:47.599 --> 12:50.599
- <i>You guys have a good time?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh, we did.</i>

13:25.970 --> 13:28.070
- What the fuck is this?
- <i>Huh?</i>

13:28.072 --> 13:30.074
- What happened to Jose?
- Oh, well...

13:31.643 --> 13:33.843
We let him go for a few months.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.781
Well, so he's still
cutting our grass, right?

13:36.815 --> 13:37.947
Yeah.

13:37.949 --> 13:39.515
I mean,
I'm... I'm... I'm assuming so.

13:39.517 --> 13:41.383
We didn't say anything
about yours.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.319
Oh. Alright. Okay.

13:44.321 --> 13:46.189
<i>It's good exercise, actually.</i>

13:46.191 --> 13:48.690
- What?
- Cutting the grass.

13:48.692 --> 13:51.461
Alright. Okay, man.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.063
- I'll catch you later.
- <i>Alright, see you, Harry.</i>

13:59.738 --> 14:00.773
Huh.

14:17.287 --> 14:18.257
Thanks.

14:19.257 --> 14:21.223
<i>Welcome to DriverX.</i>

14:21.225 --> 14:23.458
<i>Drivers are our most
important members</i>

14:23.460 --> 14:26.628
<i>and at DriverX,
we truly value a good X.</i>

14:26.630 --> 14:29.498
<i>When you DriverX,
you're able to go online</i>

14:29.500 --> 14:31.434
<i>whenever you want
and find people</i>

14:31.436 --> 14:34.069
<i>who need rides
anywhere in your city.</i>

14:34.071 --> 14:37.240
<i>You will swipe a button
that says Go Online.</i>

14:37.242 --> 14:40.609
<i>Once you're online, you start
to receive trip requests.</i>

14:40.611 --> 14:44.514
<i>When a rider requests a trip,
the Xer closest to that rider</i>

14:44.516 --> 14:47.049
<i>automatically receives
the request.</i>

14:47.051 --> 14:48.918
<i>Your Xs will throb blue</i>

14:48.920 --> 14:51.753
<i>bathing your vehicle
in a pleasant light.</i>

14:51.755 --> 14:53.691
<i>Swipe the tab to accept.</i>

14:58.263 --> 15:01.030
- Wow.
- What the hell is this?

15:01.032 --> 15:04.099
DriverX. I'm employed.

15:04.101 --> 15:06.702
DriverX, the taxi?

15:06.704 --> 15:08.907
It's a little different.
You use your own car.

15:11.109 --> 15:13.208
Wh... when did you even
interview?

15:13.210 --> 15:15.277
I didn't.
I just applied online.

15:15.279 --> 15:17.479
Never even met a human being.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.615
Nothing
but an online background check.

15:19.617 --> 15:21.687
That's creepy.

15:24.321 --> 15:26.258
Well, how much money
can you make?

15:26.990 --> 15:28.460
I don't know.

16:51.808 --> 16:53.478
Come on.

17:22.272 --> 17:24.906
It was so weird.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.309
There were gates

17:26.310 --> 17:29.611
and there was, like, a lot
of Jewish stuff in the house.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.713
- <i>And I was, like...</i>
- Hi.

17:31.715 --> 17:35.283
...place to have a, you know.

17:35.285 --> 17:36.654
I mean...

17:37.955 --> 17:40.755
<i>Hold on.
What took you so long?</i>

17:40.757 --> 17:42.992
<i>You were right next to me
when I requested.</i>

17:42.994 --> 17:44.926
I'm sorry,
I... I missed the turn

17:44.928 --> 17:47.062
and then I had to double back
all the way around

17:47.064 --> 17:49.000
to come back in here.

17:51.135 --> 17:52.335
No.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.837
No, the... the fiancee girl
was cute

17:54.839 --> 17:57.005
<i>the husband was not.</i>

17:57.007 --> 17:59.642
She was, like, you and I can

17:59.644 --> 18:05.681
but, like, only
if you and my fiancee first.

18:05.683 --> 18:08.453
<i>And I was, like,
"I don't know."</i>

18:09.553 --> 18:10.988
<i>He was short.</i>

18:12.389 --> 18:13.725
Where to?

18:16.694 --> 18:19.865
Hi, guy.
I already input the address.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.534
Oh.

18:26.737 --> 18:29.173
Oh, oh, I... Okay, I see.

18:30.308 --> 18:31.874
Okay.

18:31.876 --> 18:33.045
Okay.

18:34.478 --> 18:37.546
<i>Anyway, I took like
all these weird selfies</i>

18:37.548 --> 18:39.348
in their bathroom.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.684
Yeah, I, like, got up
on the counter

18:41.686 --> 18:43.819
<i>and, like, yeah.</i>

18:43.821 --> 18:45.687
<i>I'll totally send you some.</i>

18:45.689 --> 18:47.359
Okay. Bye.

18:52.096 --> 18:54.833
You're supposed to ask me my
name before you start the drive.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.466
Excuse me?

18:58.468 --> 19:01.404
To verify
I'm the correct person.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.709
<i>A lot of people get ripped off,
you know?</i>

19:06.144 --> 19:09.214
- What's your name?
- It's a little late now.

19:10.881 --> 19:13.281
And you're not supposed
to be driving with your phone

19:13.283 --> 19:15.219
in your hand. That's illegal.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.953
Is this your stop up here
on the left?

19:18.955 --> 19:20.359
Yes.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.493
Uh, you know, you just crossed
two double lines.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.663
Can I, uh, drop you right here?

19:27.665 --> 19:30.068
Yes, this is fine. Stop.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.245
Are you gonna stop the ride?

20:11.676 --> 20:13.908
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.412
- Uh, name, please?
- Name?

20:16.414 --> 20:18.313
Uh, yeah.
I need your name to match...

20:18.315 --> 20:20.351
You just picked me up
at my house.

20:21.651 --> 20:25.020
Right. Right.
Sorry about that.

20:25.022 --> 20:26.187
Uh, you know, it's been awhile
since I've been

20:26.189 --> 20:27.223
this high up in the hills.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.290
Would you mind, please

20:28.292 --> 20:30.227
guiding me down a bit?

20:32.629 --> 20:34.463
Make a right, uh, up ahead.

20:34.465 --> 20:36.400
Stay right at the fork up ahead.

20:38.002 --> 20:39.467
How long you been driving?

20:39.469 --> 20:42.137
Actually, it's my first night.

20:42.139 --> 20:44.272
So what else do you do?

20:44.274 --> 20:46.274
Uh, did, actually.

20:46.276 --> 20:47.909
I owned a record store
over on Woodman

20:47.911 --> 20:49.412
for the past quarter century.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.347
It was called
The Last Record Store.

20:51.349 --> 20:53.816
Prophetic.

20:53.818 --> 20:56.588
Actually, it was a reference
to a Little Feat album.

20:58.321 --> 21:00.425
Can you make a living
doing this?

21:01.225 --> 21:03.792
I have no idea.

21:03.794 --> 21:05.828
I mean, this is only temporary,
you know.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.762
I had a, uh, interview

21:07.764 --> 21:10.566
in a management position,
uh, at Pop Fizz.

21:10.568 --> 21:11.767
I... I think
it went pretty well.

21:11.769 --> 21:13.003
<i>Oh.</i>

21:16.808 --> 21:18.941
What if you don't get it?

21:18.943 --> 21:20.878
- Oh, the... the job?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

21:23.747 --> 21:26.348
Uh, I don't know.

21:26.350 --> 21:28.983
I haven't really
thought about it.

21:28.985 --> 21:30.519
Good luck.

21:30.521 --> 21:32.488
Make a right
at Sunset Boulevard.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.056
Uh-huh.

21:34.058 --> 21:36.361
And I hope you know
where Sunset Boulevard is.

21:49.005 --> 21:50.438
Hey.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.973
Can you get me back to Van Nuys?

21:51.975 --> 21:54.542
Uh, Woodman and Burbank.

21:54.544 --> 21:56.180
<i>That I can do.</i>

21:59.317 --> 22:01.082
How you doing tonight, Leonard?

22:01.084 --> 22:03.886
Uh, good, Julio.

22:03.888 --> 22:05.119
How you doin' tonight?

22:05.121 --> 22:07.490
I'm good.
Thank you for asking.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.961
I've not taken a sip of alcohol
in 40 days.

22:11.561 --> 22:13.028
- Huh?
- <i>Okay.</i>

22:13.030 --> 22:14.965
- It's a good night.
- <i>Alright.</i>

22:23.307 --> 22:25.574
How long you been married?

22:25.576 --> 22:27.643
- Fifteen years.
- Whoa.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.648
Shit, that's a long time.
You got me beat.

22:30.915 --> 22:32.850
You hate your wife yet?

22:37.821 --> 22:38.924
Sometimes.

22:40.891 --> 22:42.691
I hate mine.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.460
<i>But we've got
a beautiful little boy</i>

22:44.462 --> 22:45.994
and he keeps me in the marriage

22:45.996 --> 22:49.397
or he keeps her
in the marriage. I...

22:49.399 --> 22:51.032
<i>So, what, am I supposed
to wish my wife dies</i>

22:51.034 --> 22:52.166
<i>so I could get out
of the marriage?</i>

22:52.168 --> 22:54.235
<i>I don't wanna be that guy, so...</i>

22:54.237 --> 22:56.171
What are you gonna do?

22:56.173 --> 22:59.241
- You have kids?
- I got... I got two girls.

22:59.243 --> 23:00.376
<i>So you know
what I'm talkin' about.</i>

23:00.378 --> 23:01.743
- Yeah, yeah, I do.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

23:01.745 --> 23:03.611
That's what saves the marriage.

23:03.613 --> 23:05.583
That and Chinese massages.

23:07.685 --> 23:10.618
I go to this place.
It's called Happy Foot.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.155
There's, like, 12,000 of them
in the valley.

23:13.157 --> 23:16.125
Check it out next time you're
there. You'll notice them.

23:16.127 --> 23:18.930
It's clean, professional.
No fluids exchanged.

23:20.497 --> 23:22.630
<i>Monogamy doesn't work.</i>

23:22.632 --> 23:25.099
<i>It's unnatural.</i>

23:25.101 --> 23:27.104
When everything is said
and done...

23:29.005 --> 23:30.941
...all you have is Happy Foot.

23:32.676 --> 23:34.612
And Happy Foot is okay.

23:41.118 --> 23:43.722
I'm not going far.
I'll show you.

23:44.821 --> 23:46.090
Okay.

23:50.194 --> 23:52.129
Make a left at the light.

23:57.901 --> 23:59.837
How are you tonight?

24:05.141 --> 24:07.411
Um, I'm good. Thank you.

24:12.449 --> 24:14.686
Uh, how are you?
How are you doing tonight?

24:16.520 --> 24:19.523
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

24:21.292 --> 24:23.061
Oh, bummer.

24:41.411 --> 24:43.447
Oh, yeah,
it's a right turn here.

24:48.452 --> 24:50.622
<i>And, uh, I'm at the end
of the street.</i>

24:52.055 --> 24:53.457
<i>Perfect.</i>

25:00.231 --> 25:02.630
Thank you so much.

25:02.632 --> 25:04.568
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- You're welcome.

25:16.981 --> 25:19.651
I'm drunk.

25:24.421 --> 25:28.223
I have been drinking,
like, a lot.

25:28.225 --> 25:29.526
Oh.

25:31.762 --> 25:33.130
Yes.

25:48.545 --> 25:49.912
Okay.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.789
Mm. Mm.

26:32.022 --> 26:33.390
Don't.

27:19.102 --> 27:21.537
- Have you seen my keys?
- In the green bowl.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.575
Kids? Breakfast. Pancakes.

27:27.878 --> 27:30.044
- Huh?
- No.

27:30.046 --> 27:32.213
I'm scaling back on all that.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.218
Detoxing. Remember?

27:40.523 --> 27:42.624
What time did you get home
last night?

27:42.626 --> 27:44.829
Uh, 1:30.

27:50.167 --> 27:52.403
- How did it go?
- It was alright.

27:54.504 --> 27:56.640
I'm a little tired,
but it was okay.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.482
Any weirdos or...

28:06.015 --> 28:07.317
No.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.923
Well, did you talk to anyone?

28:13.456 --> 28:15.426
Well, you sorta have to. I...

28:17.127 --> 28:19.194
Yes, I mean, it was...
it was a little weird

28:19.196 --> 28:21.163
having strangers
in the car at first.

28:21.165 --> 28:23.635
But, I, uh,
I think I'm over it now.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.876
How much money did you make?

28:37.080 --> 28:39.950
Thirty-seven,
a... and some change.

28:43.186 --> 28:45.189
It was my first night.

28:47.224 --> 28:49.156
Well, it's Friday night tonight.

28:49.158 --> 28:51.094
Right? That should be better.

29:52.156 --> 29:54.225
You been doing DriverX long?

29:55.591 --> 29:58.126
- Uh, about a week.
- Oh.

29:58.128 --> 30:00.896
- Maybe that's what it is, man.
- Mm-hmm.

30:00.898 --> 30:02.431
<i>W... what is?</i>

30:02.433 --> 30:05.634
Why your DriverX rating
is so low?

30:05.636 --> 30:08.169
I mean,
you seem like a nice guy.

30:08.171 --> 30:10.371
My... my DriverX rating is low?

30:10.373 --> 30:13.140
Yeah, it's so low that
we almost solicited a driver

30:13.142 --> 30:15.109
from further away.

30:15.111 --> 30:18.813
Wait, you mean, you mean
a 2.45 out of 3X's isn't good?

30:18.815 --> 30:20.514
Nah, you want
like a 2.8 or higher.

30:20.516 --> 30:23.484
- No less than a 2.7.
- 2.7, yeah. Definitely not.

30:23.486 --> 30:25.386
- Wow. I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.856
Yeah, you know,
you should get some waters too.

30:27.858 --> 30:29.857
People get drunk.
You know, they go out.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.059
- They get dehydrated.
- They're dehydrated. Yeah.

30:32.061 --> 30:34.261
And, uh, gum or Altoids.

30:34.263 --> 30:36.330
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah, everybody does it.

30:36.332 --> 30:39.100
- <i>And get a phone charger.</i>
- <i>Auxiliary cable.</i>

30:39.102 --> 30:41.869
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. Drunk people
love to listen to their music.

30:41.871 --> 30:44.473
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And dress nice, man.

30:44.475 --> 30:45.941
Nice, casual.

30:45.943 --> 30:47.876
Yeah, I didn't mean
not just nice, nice.

30:47.878 --> 30:50.080
<i>Don't overdo it though.
Just cool, you know.</i>

30:51.115 --> 30:53.718
That should cover it, right?

30:56.253 --> 30:58.220
- Geez, thanks, guys.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31:24.648 --> 31:26.114
Wait a second.

31:26.116 --> 31:28.082
<i>That's it. I got it.</i>

31:28.084 --> 31:30.117
You had that record store
on Woodman.

31:30.119 --> 31:32.521
That, uh, what was it called?

31:32.523 --> 31:34.556
- The Last Record Store.
- The Last Record Store!

31:34.558 --> 31:36.060
- That's right.
- Yeah.

31:37.427 --> 31:40.061
Man, I spent years of my life
in that place.

31:40.063 --> 31:41.829
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:41.831 --> 31:44.465
Sorry that that business
went the way it did.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.335
I hung on way too long.

31:47.337 --> 31:50.638
<i>God, uh,
y... you had everything.</i>

31:50.640 --> 31:54.076
I... I discovered the Pixies
in that 4AD section.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.676
- Back right corner.
- That's right.

31:55.678 --> 31:57.748
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.015
You used to do this thing

32:01.017 --> 32:03.217
a... a... and I think you did it
with a lot of people

32:03.219 --> 32:04.453
but it was brilliant.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.687
You would, you would give me

32:06.689 --> 32:10.024
an LP or a CD
and try it out for free.

32:10.026 --> 32:12.226
<i>And I only had to pay for it
if I actually liked it.</i>

32:12.228 --> 32:15.230
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

32:15.232 --> 32:17.435
I think I paid
for every single one.

32:19.168 --> 32:22.136
Oh, you, you had a gift.

32:22.138 --> 32:24.942
You had this uncanny ability
to match-make with music.

32:26.776 --> 32:29.046
- Thanks, man.
- <i>It was a great store.</i>

32:31.180 --> 32:32.649
Yeah, it was.

32:36.619 --> 32:39.320
I always hoped that that store
was gonna be my legacy

32:39.322 --> 32:42.089
for my daughters, you know.

32:42.091 --> 32:44.594
They'd be able to wander up
and down the aisles and...

32:46.396 --> 32:48.331
...pick stuff up
and say, "What's this?"

32:49.699 --> 32:51.436
Discover new music.

32:53.236 --> 32:55.038
But now, you know...

32:56.005 --> 32:57.941
...CDs, records, all that...

32:59.510 --> 33:01.446
...it's not gonna be around
when they grow up.

33:03.946 --> 33:06.815
I sold my collection
for pennies on the dollar.

33:06.817 --> 33:08.753
My entire library is now...

33:09.953 --> 33:11.355
...in a computer.

33:29.039 --> 33:31.138
Miranda?

33:31.140 --> 33:32.275
Good girl.

33:37.781 --> 33:39.517
Up, up, up. Come on.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.669
Your girls are throwing sand.

34:01.671 --> 34:03.070
<i>Hey, stop that! Stop that!</i>

34:03.072 --> 34:05.240
Did you throw sand
at that woman's kid? Hey.

34:05.242 --> 34:07.145
Hey. Girls?

34:09.612 --> 34:10.612
Nice.

34:10.614 --> 34:13.348
Ah, I know, I know.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.063
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Oh, hey, Harry.

34:29.065 --> 34:30.301
Hey.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.509
- You fire Rob too?
- Yeah.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.350
My old man used to do all this.

34:47.451 --> 34:50.150
Yeah, that was in 1975.

34:50.152 --> 34:53.357
Well, what the hell difference
does that make?

34:55.491 --> 34:57.294
He was a man.

34:58.761 --> 35:01.228
I thought you two had
a rough time.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.167
Yeah, we did and we didn't.

35:04.634 --> 35:06.571
It was the fucking '70s.

35:12.942 --> 35:16.210
You know, Leonard,
if, if you need something

35:16.212 --> 35:19.313
money, you could take
your time paying back.

35:19.315 --> 35:20.750
Harry, we're okay.

35:25.621 --> 35:27.558
You know, sometimes
a wakeup call's a good thing.

35:29.525 --> 35:32.126
But thank you, man.

35:32.128 --> 35:33.764
- What...
- I appreciate it.

35:35.098 --> 35:37.268
You sure?
I mean, I'm serious. It's...

35:39.402 --> 35:41.973
I know. I'm positive.
We're okay.

36:16.272 --> 36:18.441
Come on.
I'm gonna go take a shower.

36:19.476 --> 36:21.212
You wanna come?

36:23.212 --> 36:25.749
Uh, why don't you go get clean
and I'll meet you in bed.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.451
No shower?

36:30.252 --> 36:32.455
You know, that's not
the sexy spot for me.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.099
Actually, though, I did try
and get laid last night.

37:19.101 --> 37:22.302
- Oh, my crimson river.
- Eww. No.

37:22.304 --> 37:24.072
No, he was actually
a gentleman about it.

37:24.074 --> 37:26.708
He said, literally said,
word-for-word.

37:26.710 --> 37:29.210
- Okay.
- "Aren't we both adults here?"

37:29.212 --> 37:30.779
- Can't we just...
- That's great. That's great.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.280
And then I was, like,
"You don't mind if I bleed?"

37:33.282 --> 37:36.016
And he said, "That's what
the towels were for."

37:36.018 --> 37:37.786
Okay, so what happened?

37:37.788 --> 37:40.755
Well, I mean, the lubrication.
Oh, on point.

37:40.757 --> 37:42.556
- That much was golden.
- Okay.

37:42.558 --> 37:45.759
But, however, I was...

37:45.761 --> 37:48.730
You know, I was crampy.
So I was like super cloggy.

37:48.732 --> 37:50.831
Oh, god. Gross.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.567
Just vibe that shit out.

37:52.569 --> 37:54.501
Why are we even
having this conversation?

37:54.503 --> 37:56.371
Because mine's broken.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.907
Why don't you go to the store?

37:58.909 --> 38:01.278
I will. I'm just a lazy bitch.

38:02.878 --> 38:04.179
- Sir?
- Hmm?

38:04.181 --> 38:06.947
Uh, do you mind if I,
if I roll a blunt back here?

38:06.949 --> 38:08.886
Not to smoke, just prep.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.487
- Uh, sure.
- Oh, you're a sweetheart.

38:13.489 --> 38:14.721
How do I look?

38:14.723 --> 38:17.625
Oh, my God. You look,
you look super-hot.

38:17.627 --> 38:20.527
- Like hip hop hot, you know.
- That comfy slutty.

38:20.529 --> 38:22.529
Comfy slutty.
That is exactly what this is.

38:22.531 --> 38:24.032
Like, this is such
a slutty dress

38:24.034 --> 38:25.500
but, like, I'm really
comfortable in it.

38:25.502 --> 38:26.601
You know what I mean,
and then I'm like

38:26.603 --> 38:29.070
literally wearing sneaker heels.

38:29.072 --> 38:30.672
Like, it's magical
if you could do both.

38:30.674 --> 38:32.840
It's magical
if you can get laid.

38:32.842 --> 38:34.976
Ah, excuse me.

38:34.978 --> 38:36.945
Could you have an AUX cord?

38:36.947 --> 38:39.213
- Oh, uh, yeah.
- Ah!

38:39.215 --> 38:41.551
- Right here.
- I just love you.

38:42.819 --> 38:45.018
Perfect.

38:45.020 --> 38:48.056
Okay. Let's get ready to rage.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.449
DriverX?

39:15.451 --> 39:17.751
- Tom?
- Whoo-whoo.

39:17.753 --> 39:19.587
What's up?

39:19.589 --> 39:22.123
- How you doin' tonight?
- What's going on, my dude?

39:22.125 --> 39:26.293
- <i>Como se llama?</i>
- <i>Me llama Leonardo.</i>

39:26.295 --> 39:28.730
Leonardo. What?

39:28.732 --> 39:32.032
Leonardo in the house!

39:32.034 --> 39:33.934
That's right.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.304
- Oh, did you get the address?
- Yeah, yeah, I... I did.

39:36.306 --> 39:38.275
- It's navigating right now.
- Oh, cool.

39:39.743 --> 39:41.511
So I'm from China.

39:42.878 --> 39:44.746
Wonderful.

39:44.748 --> 39:47.047
How are things in China?

39:47.049 --> 39:49.683
A little crowded, I think.

39:49.685 --> 39:51.485
- <i>So where are you from?</i>
- Miami.

39:51.487 --> 39:52.954
- <i>Yeah? Born and raised?</i>
- No.

39:52.956 --> 39:54.688
I'm born in Pittsburgh,
raised in Miami, Florida.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.893
Cool. And, like, what brought
you to Los Angeles?

39:59.795 --> 40:02.031
Dreams and happiness, my friend.

40:03.232 --> 40:05.233
What better place to do it
than LA.

40:05.235 --> 40:07.936
- Whoo-whoo, right?
- Yeah.

40:07.938 --> 40:10.237
Oh, yo, I moved to Los Angeles

40:10.239 --> 40:11.838
because I was dating
this actress.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.440
Yeah. California girl

40:13.442 --> 40:15.643
grew up in Newport Beach
or whatever.

40:15.645 --> 40:17.545
I don't know.

40:17.547 --> 40:20.848
- She wound up dumping me.
- What? Bitch.

40:20.850 --> 40:24.184
That's right,
motherfucking biatch.

40:24.186 --> 40:26.123
How long ago was that?

40:26.956 --> 40:30.291
Uh, 5 years ago.

40:30.293 --> 40:32.263
Something. I don't know.

40:34.397 --> 40:36.998
She ruined me real good.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.936
<i>Her name was Cheyenne.</i>

40:40.804 --> 40:43.173
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.748
Oh, hey, you wanna, like, listen
to some music or anything?

40:53.750 --> 40:56.451
Uh, yeah, that depends.
What do you got?

40:56.453 --> 41:00.087
W... why, are you picky?
You don't like shit or what?

41:00.089 --> 41:02.190
No, it's... it's not that.
It's just I'm a...

41:02.192 --> 41:04.726
I'm a little, well, old school
in a weird way.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.261
Wait, weird? What?

41:07.263 --> 41:08.933
Not old, it's just...

41:11.234 --> 41:13.270
You know, I have
a Peter Frampton live album.

41:15.170 --> 41:16.270
Frampton Comes Alive.

41:16.272 --> 41:18.208
And when I pull it off
the shelf...

41:19.942 --> 41:21.409
...you can just feel it.

41:21.411 --> 41:22.909
You know,
the card stock is thick.

41:22.911 --> 41:25.145
It's heavy, shiny,
and when you open it up

41:25.147 --> 41:27.415
you hear the, the crack
of the crease.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.516
You look inside,
you can see the band members

41:29.518 --> 41:32.152
you could, you know,
read the liner notes.

41:32.154 --> 41:33.621
And then when you flipped it
on the front

41:33.623 --> 41:37.058
there's Peter's face,
his blond hair.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.192
And when you flip it down

41:38.194 --> 41:40.427
his hands are clutching
that Gibson guitar.

41:40.429 --> 41:42.996
60,000 people at the Coliseum
are watching him play

41:42.998 --> 41:44.998
and you can feel it.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.402
And all that's happening before
you even put the record on.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.340
You're already experiencing it.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.540
Yeah.

41:52.542 --> 41:54.141
Yeah?

41:54.143 --> 41:55.610
- Fuck, yeah.
- Fuck, yeah is right.

41:55.612 --> 41:56.811
- I'm buyin' that.
- Yeah.

41:56.813 --> 41:59.179
Shit. Sold.

41:59.181 --> 42:00.982
Amazon tonight. On it.

42:03.219 --> 42:05.520
Oh, but, alright.

42:05.522 --> 42:07.654
Truth be told,
there's still a lot

42:07.656 --> 42:09.556
of bitchin' music out there
these days, Leonard.

42:09.558 --> 42:10.757
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:10.759 --> 42:13.229
You just gotta... look for it,
you know.

42:15.397 --> 42:18.301
- Hey, is this you up ahead?
- Oh, shit! Yeah.

42:26.576 --> 42:28.442
Leonard, I like you.

42:28.444 --> 42:31.311
Tom, I like you too.

42:31.313 --> 42:32.813
Uh, Leonard.

42:32.815 --> 42:34.715
Goddammit, give me your number.

42:34.717 --> 42:36.851
When I get done here,
I wants to call you.

42:36.853 --> 42:38.786
You is who I wants to call.

42:38.788 --> 42:40.253
I... I appreciate that

42:40.255 --> 42:41.788
but we're really not supposed
to do that sort of thing.

42:41.790 --> 42:43.090
Look, you... you already
paid me on the app.

42:43.092 --> 42:44.692
No, look, look, I'll call you

42:44.694 --> 42:45.992
and you come right up next to me

42:45.994 --> 42:48.829
and then I'll request you
on my phone.

42:48.831 --> 42:50.000
Can't miss.

42:58.540 --> 42:59.674
Are you, uh...

42:59.676 --> 43:00.775
Looking for something
to write on, man.

43:00.777 --> 43:02.275
Oh, you're going old school,
huh?

43:02.277 --> 43:04.112
I could just put it up
in my phone if you want to.

43:04.114 --> 43:05.315
Here you go.

43:07.417 --> 43:08.916
Hmm.

43:08.918 --> 43:10.921
There you go, man.

43:12.188 --> 43:14.788
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Okay.

43:14.790 --> 43:19.025
- Bon voyage, Leonardo!
- Bon voyage.

43:20.830 --> 43:23.130
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:23.132 --> 43:24.799
Oh, why did I do that?

43:59.502 --> 44:01.201
- <i>Chelsea.</i>
- Chelsea?

44:01.203 --> 44:03.103
<i>Alright. Wait, no, no, no.
Down here, down here.</i>

44:03.105 --> 44:05.505
Where are you going?

44:05.507 --> 44:07.175
- <i>Alright. Everybody in?</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

44:07.177 --> 44:09.409
- <i>It's disgusting.</i>
- It's fine. It's a car.

44:09.411 --> 44:12.712
- <i>Doesn't matter.</i>
- <i>You're such an asshole.</i>

44:12.714 --> 44:14.282
- <i>God.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

44:14.284 --> 44:16.284
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

44:16.286 --> 44:18.152
- <i>Hey, come on.</i>
- <i>Let's go.</i>

44:18.154 --> 44:19.753
- Go!
- Alright.

44:19.755 --> 44:21.221
Are we... are we all in?
We all in?

44:21.223 --> 44:22.422
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Alright, let's go.</i>

44:22.424 --> 44:23.958
Where are you go...
Where are we going?

44:23.960 --> 44:25.992
- <i>We're not going home.</i>
- Where are we going?

44:25.994 --> 44:27.561
Ah, yes, please,
where are we going?

44:27.563 --> 44:29.663
- We're going to a bar.
- I wanna go home.

44:29.665 --> 44:31.132
- I want to go home.
- No.

44:31.134 --> 44:33.266
- Why? It's 3:00...
- My fucking back hurts.

44:33.268 --> 44:34.634
- My fucking back hurts.
- Alright, alright, alright.

44:34.636 --> 44:35.735
- First we're gonna...
- So you wanna go home?

44:35.737 --> 44:37.137
First, we're gonna go to a CVS

44:37.139 --> 44:39.674
so we can get some BENGAY
for her back.

44:39.676 --> 44:41.576
- For Chelsea.
- I...

44:41.578 --> 44:44.978
Go to, um,
fucking Main Street?

44:44.980 --> 44:47.380
<i>Wait, wait.
So... so no... no CVS.</i>

44:47.382 --> 44:48.449
- No!
- No!

44:48.451 --> 44:49.851
- Uh, Main Street then.
- Uh, McKinney.

44:49.853 --> 44:52.052
Just take me to where
there's no fucking old people.

44:52.054 --> 44:53.253
- Yeah.
- Duh.

44:53.255 --> 44:54.788
This fuckin' old creep
that's not gonna think

44:54.790 --> 44:56.123
she's gonna be in a movie.

44:56.125 --> 44:58.326
<i>And this fucking skank.</i>

44:58.328 --> 45:01.094
I was joking.
I wasn't being serious with him.

45:01.096 --> 45:04.665
Uh-huh. She's like,
"Can I be in your movie?"

45:04.667 --> 45:07.335
Yeah, they're gonna put me
as an extra in his movie.

45:07.337 --> 45:08.869
Okay, I'm gonna be
in the background.

45:08.871 --> 45:11.005
You're gonna be so important.

45:11.007 --> 45:14.041
Yes, I am.
You know, get discovered, okay?

45:15.545 --> 45:17.344
Stupid.

45:17.346 --> 45:19.480
<i>My legs are so hairy.</i>

45:19.482 --> 45:21.382
Oh, my gosh.
Your legs are so soft.

45:21.384 --> 45:24.251
- <i>No, they're so hairy.</i>
- You're so sexy.

45:24.253 --> 45:26.554
You're, like,
the hottest person ever.

45:26.556 --> 45:28.389
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Your legs are so sexy.

45:28.391 --> 45:32.592
Oh, my God!
Stop flirting with me, you slut.

45:32.594 --> 45:35.228
- I'm not a lesbian.
- I'm not a lesbian.

45:35.230 --> 45:37.732
- You guys are gonna scissor.
- Not now.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.266
No. We don't do that.

45:39.268 --> 45:41.835
- I like boys.
- <i>I like wiener.</i>

45:41.837 --> 45:43.840
<i>That's good 'cause I got one.</i>

45:47.509 --> 45:49.342
- I don't feel good.
- What?

45:49.344 --> 45:50.378
What do you mean
you don't feel good?

45:50.380 --> 45:51.411
I'm fine.

45:51.413 --> 45:52.545
- I'm fine.
- Are you gonna puke?

45:52.547 --> 45:54.315
- I was kidding.
- Dude, switch places with him.

45:54.317 --> 45:55.483
- Are you gonna fucking puke?
- No.

45:55.485 --> 45:57.351
Switch places with him
and puke out the window.

45:57.353 --> 45:58.920
Hey, roll down the window, man.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.420
- Oh, my God. She's gonna...
- I'm fine.

46:00.422 --> 46:01.922
- Should we pull over?
- No.

46:01.924 --> 46:02.989
- I was kidding.
- Oh, my God!

46:02.991 --> 46:05.192
It was a, it was a false alarm.

46:05.194 --> 46:08.895
Can you get a handle on her?
Jesus Christ.

46:08.897 --> 46:11.032
<i>Is she okay?</i>

46:11.034 --> 46:15.969
I'm gonna buy everybody in here
one of those, uh...

46:15.971 --> 46:17.170
E... even you, dude.

46:17.172 --> 46:19.974
I'm gonna buy everybody
bacon-wrapped hot dogs

46:19.976 --> 46:21.675
<i>or whatever the fuck
it's called.</i>

46:21.677 --> 46:24.978
Hey, just drop us off
on the corner here.

46:24.980 --> 46:26.079
What?

46:26.081 --> 46:28.683
D... drop us off
on the corner here.

46:28.685 --> 46:30.116
- Just over here?
- Yes!

46:30.118 --> 46:32.286
- Alright. Alright.
- God.

46:32.288 --> 46:34.587
<i>Am I not speaking English?
Jesus.</i>

46:37.527 --> 46:39.092
<i>I wanna get out.</i>

46:39.094 --> 46:40.994
<i>I wanna get out.
I wanna get out.</i>

46:40.996 --> 46:43.399
- <i>I wanna get out.</i>
- <i>Shh. Shh.</i>

46:44.567 --> 46:45.636
Ugh.

46:47.069 --> 46:51.771
Hey, is, um, is there a way
to tip you on the app?

46:51.773 --> 46:53.206
<i>No.</i>

46:53.208 --> 46:56.143
No? It's $4.

46:56.145 --> 46:57.911
What does he mean, no tip?

46:57.913 --> 47:00.146
Look at this price.
It's 4 fucking dollars.

47:00.148 --> 47:01.849
I know. It's good.
Thank you, Leonard.

47:01.851 --> 47:04.317
- No. Without a tip.
- Come on.

47:04.319 --> 47:05.686
- Why do you do it?
- Chelsea, come on.

47:05.688 --> 47:07.654
Seriously, dude.
Why do you do it?

47:07.656 --> 47:09.591
Why do you do it?

47:12.661 --> 47:13.696
<i>Idiot.</i>

48:30.306 --> 48:31.572
Just take me to the Denny's.

49:09.878 --> 49:11.714
- Leonard?
- <i>Tammy?</i>

49:12.982 --> 49:15.018
- Front or back?
- <i>Uh, whichever you like.</i>

49:23.759 --> 49:25.829
- Get the address?
- Yep.

49:27.063 --> 49:29.532
What time is it?

49:31.701 --> 49:33.634
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:33.636 --> 49:35.272
You bet. No problem.

49:42.645 --> 49:44.581
So how's your day going?

49:45.413 --> 49:47.783
Um, good.

49:49.518 --> 49:50.654
And yours?

49:52.822 --> 49:54.188
Tired.

49:54.190 --> 49:57.056
- Ready to stop drinking.
- Mm.

49:57.058 --> 49:59.626
But it, it seems like
you're going to continue.

50:01.163 --> 50:04.864
Leonard, it's like
you already know my shit.

50:15.177 --> 50:16.545
I'm sorry.

50:18.281 --> 50:20.516
Uh, no, that's, uh,
it's not a problem.

50:26.087 --> 50:27.820
What happened to the girls
behind us?

50:27.822 --> 50:29.489
What's that?

50:29.491 --> 50:31.692
The girls.
I thought they were behind us.

50:31.694 --> 50:33.059
- In the car?
- Yes.

50:33.061 --> 50:34.594
- Uh, no.
- What?

50:34.596 --> 50:36.230
- Were there other girls...
- Are you kidding me?

50:36.232 --> 50:37.697
- Yes!
- No, no.

50:37.699 --> 50:38.799
You were alone
when I picked you up.

50:38.801 --> 50:40.300
Oh, my God,
did we leave them behind?

50:40.302 --> 50:41.402
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

50:41.404 --> 50:42.402
For God's sake,
we can totally go back...

50:42.404 --> 50:44.340
No! No! No!

50:47.976 --> 50:50.045
We're going all the way.

50:51.581 --> 50:55.552
Just you and me.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.822
We're doing it.

51:01.357 --> 51:03.393
- Yeah, we are.
- Hmm.

51:11.900 --> 51:13.002
Ready.

51:17.973 --> 51:19.375
Let it go.

51:21.877 --> 51:23.344
Let go.

51:25.581 --> 51:27.584
Yeah. Like, let's go.

51:30.853 --> 51:31.851
What?

51:34.824 --> 51:36.991
Oh, my G...

51:36.993 --> 51:38.058
Let go.

51:42.031 --> 51:43.833
<i>Oh.</i>

51:48.471 --> 51:50.840
♪ Na na na na ♪

51:52.340 --> 51:54.543
♪ Na na na na ♪

51:55.677 --> 51:58.080
♪ Na na na na ♪

51:59.081 --> 52:01.014
♪ Na na na na ♪

52:01.016 --> 52:03.317
Oh, yeah.

52:03.319 --> 52:04.851
Oh, my God. No.

52:04.853 --> 52:06.387
Stop. I'm just kidding.

52:13.429 --> 52:15.865
- Guys hate me.
- What?

52:17.366 --> 52:18.467
Why?

52:21.304 --> 52:23.506
A little too much for them,
I guess.

52:28.610 --> 52:29.746
<i>Oh.</i>

52:33.014 --> 52:34.348
Ah.

52:44.326 --> 52:47.196
- Are we here?
- Yeah, um, yeah.

52:49.197 --> 52:50.496
Oh.

53:01.076 --> 53:02.909
Bye.

53:02.911 --> 53:04.313
You have everything?

53:19.228 --> 53:21.231
Oh, I think you look younger
without the beard.

53:25.467 --> 53:27.136
FYI, this place has been...

53:28.036 --> 53:29.168
...debugged.

53:29.170 --> 53:30.105
Huh.

53:31.540 --> 53:33.373
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

53:33.375 --> 53:34.507
<i>Well, how long has it been</i>

53:34.509 --> 53:36.446
<i>since your last confession,
my son?</i>

53:44.185 --> 53:45.953
Is it Dawn?

53:45.955 --> 53:47.891
<i>I noticed a little tension
over dinner.</i>

53:51.127 --> 53:54.594
Look, last year...

53:54.596 --> 53:57.331
...I felt like Jackie and I
were gonna split.

53:57.333 --> 53:58.335
<i>And we...</i>

53:59.467 --> 54:00.768
<i>...we disliked each other.</i>

54:00.770 --> 54:02.636
<i>No other way to put it.</i>

54:02.638 --> 54:04.840
We barely spoke for weeks
at a time.

54:06.409 --> 54:08.345
I thought we were toast
for sure.

54:09.545 --> 54:12.179
<i>You know, so, we go to therapy</i>

54:12.181 --> 54:14.748
<i>one last time
to try to save our marriage.</i>

54:14.750 --> 54:17.351
<i>And all this therapist
really did was</i>

54:17.353 --> 54:20.520
give us 5 words
for how to talk to one another.

54:20.522 --> 54:22.791
I mean, 5 words
to save our marriage.

54:25.161 --> 54:26.492
Okay, I'll bite.

54:28.230 --> 54:32.900
Um, let's say, uh, Dawn
is going off on you about...

54:32.902 --> 54:34.668
Oh, pick a fucking topic, right?

54:34.670 --> 54:37.603
And the, uh, pettiness
of her complaint

54:37.605 --> 54:39.405
makes your blood boil.

54:39.407 --> 54:41.844
<i>Next thing you know,
full-blown argument.</i>

54:42.944 --> 54:44.913
All you have to do is say...

54:46.815 --> 54:50.250
"...Babe, you're crazy

54:50.252 --> 54:52.786
but I still love you."

54:52.788 --> 54:56.290
Honey, you're a, a raging
fucking cunt

54:56.292 --> 54:58.525
<i>but I still love you.</i>

54:58.527 --> 55:01.695
Sweetheart, I love my beard.

55:01.697 --> 55:03.063
I wanna keep it.

55:03.065 --> 55:06.269
I will shave it for you
because I love you.

55:07.703 --> 55:10.404
- Come on.
- Fucking works.

55:10.406 --> 55:12.873
Honey, I wanna murder you
right now

55:12.875 --> 55:16.576
but I can't because I hate
the idea of hurting you.

55:16.578 --> 55:18.645
<i>I just love you too much.</i>

55:18.647 --> 55:21.614
<i>See, you can just switch it
around. Improvise.</i>

55:21.616 --> 55:25.018
But the point is, you finally
get to tell her the truth

55:25.020 --> 55:27.056
as long as you still remind her
that you love her.

55:28.491 --> 55:30.056
<i>The therapist explained
it had to do</i>

55:30.058 --> 55:32.458
with the primitive part
of the brain

55:32.460 --> 55:35.161
amygdala or lizard brain.

55:35.163 --> 55:36.432
Fight or flight.

55:38.132 --> 55:40.169
And don't underestimate
the power of words.

55:41.603 --> 55:43.136
<i>And you don't even
have to mean 'em.</i>

55:43.138 --> 55:45.271
<i>But I guarantee you</i>

55:45.273 --> 55:47.474
<i>once you start saying
I still love you</i>

55:47.476 --> 55:49.412
you can't help
but fall back in love.

55:58.753 --> 56:00.920
<i>You know, uh</i>

56:00.922 --> 56:03.926
<i>if you think this DriverX
business is gonna help...</i>

56:04.759 --> 56:05.994
...forget it.

56:07.228 --> 56:10.264
Yeah.
Yeah, I know about DriverX.

56:10.266 --> 56:11.965
Didn't you think
Jackie would tell me

56:11.967 --> 56:13.933
that you picked her up
from her cousin's?

56:15.203 --> 56:16.969
Is that why
you didn't wanna say anything?

56:16.971 --> 56:19.373
You think she's bangin' someone
on the side?

56:19.375 --> 56:21.311
That would be
none of my business.

56:23.511 --> 56:25.481
Uh, I appreciate that.

56:27.917 --> 56:29.886
Driving's my dirty secret.

56:34.656 --> 56:36.757
What am I doin'?

56:36.759 --> 56:37.994
<i>At my age.</i>

56:39.395 --> 56:41.397
Last night,
I almost got into trouble.

56:44.165 --> 56:45.534
Like, real trouble.

56:48.002 --> 56:49.338
So I don't know. I...

56:51.540 --> 56:54.373
I'm just freakin' trippin'.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.311
I don't know where I fit
in the world anymore.

56:57.446 --> 56:58.878
Same old shit.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.913
It's called getting older.

57:00.915 --> 57:02.282
Hey, think about
how our parents felt

57:02.284 --> 57:04.418
when personal computers blew up.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.320
I just don't wanna
give up the reins.

57:06.322 --> 57:08.258
I don't wanna hand it over yet.

57:10.826 --> 57:11.925
You know,
I've been gettin' to know

57:11.927 --> 57:14.161
the next generation recently.

57:14.163 --> 57:15.596
<i>And I don't even know if they
can get their fucking noses</i>

57:15.598 --> 57:16.730
<i>out of their iPhones.</i>

57:16.732 --> 57:19.398
Well, then it's your job
to teach them how.

57:19.400 --> 57:21.034
How to live.

57:21.036 --> 57:22.902
And don't make fun of them.

57:22.904 --> 57:24.804
Help them...

57:24.806 --> 57:26.042
...asshole.

57:32.413 --> 57:35.114
- Ow, careful.
- No, no, just sit on it.

57:35.116 --> 57:36.916
Okay.

57:36.918 --> 57:39.518
You... you're not hard yet.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.456
Well, rub it a little bit.

57:43.225 --> 57:45.125
That's it.

57:45.127 --> 57:46.293
Wait a minute.
Oh, goddammit.

57:46.295 --> 57:47.360
My foot's crampin' up.

57:49.130 --> 57:50.663
Ah. Mm.

57:50.665 --> 57:52.498
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57:52.500 --> 57:53.666
You alright?

57:53.668 --> 57:55.605
- Good?
- Yeah. Is that good?

57:56.705 --> 57:57.840
Okay.

58:06.014 --> 58:08.750
I'm scared about the future.

58:17.393 --> 58:18.761
Yeah, I know.

58:22.230 --> 58:24.530
Let's, let's say we fix this.

58:24.532 --> 58:26.132
I mean, what are we
gonna do in 6 months

58:26.134 --> 58:28.071
when we have to pay again?

58:35.344 --> 58:37.280
I am scared about that too.

58:38.846 --> 58:40.015
Hey.

58:43.284 --> 58:44.451
Well, for short term

58:44.453 --> 58:48.154
we could drop
all the premium channels.

58:48.156 --> 58:50.626
You know,
just go back to basic cable.

58:54.730 --> 58:56.132
Mm-hmm.

58:57.632 --> 58:59.565
I can get rid of the girls'
iPad plans.

58:59.567 --> 59:01.536
That's 60 bucks a month
right there.

59:08.476 --> 59:10.779
Drop down
to streaming on Netflix.

59:15.984 --> 59:18.321
You know, fuck Netflix.
I can go to the library.

59:23.458 --> 59:24.726
Long term...

59:38.773 --> 59:40.139
- Hello.
- Uh, hi.

59:40.141 --> 59:42.942
- What's the name, please?
- It's not for me, actually.

59:42.944 --> 59:44.911
Uh, there's a woman.

59:44.913 --> 59:46.746
Uh, she'll be here shortly.

59:46.748 --> 59:48.982
- She's intoxicated.
- Mm-hmm.

59:48.984 --> 59:50.116
Not angry.

59:50.118 --> 59:52.184
- She's just emotional.
- Okay.

59:52.186 --> 59:56.757
Her father got married tonight
and it was emotional for her.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.791
Right. You mentioned that.

59:58.793 --> 01:00:00.295
Here she comes.

01:00:03.098 --> 01:00:05.665
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:07.603
Stop. Are you kidding me? Stop.

01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:11.273
- Hi.
- <i>Hi.</i>

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.909
<i>We're not driving far.
Make the first...</i>

01:00:16.911 --> 01:00:19.411
<i>You know what, I told you
not to let me drink.</i>

01:00:19.413 --> 01:00:21.815
- Shh, it's okay.
- Don't "shh" me!

01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:23.717
I've got some water bottles
back there if you need 'em.

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:25.985
She hasn't even been gone
a year.

01:00:25.987 --> 01:00:27.487
- Drink this.
- You drink it!

01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:28.954
- Okay, stop! Enough!
- It's just...

01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:31.257
- Enough!
- No, not enough!

01:00:31.259 --> 01:00:33.192
Yes! Enough!

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.828
Do you understand
what happened in there?

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.467
Do you understand
what happened in there?

01:00:45.406 --> 01:00:46.605
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:00:46.607 --> 01:00:48.440
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Ugh!

01:00:48.442 --> 01:00:49.875
- What?
- <i>Oh!</i>

01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:52.145
- What? Oh, no!
- No!

01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.712
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh-oh.

01:00:53.714 --> 01:00:54.780
Oh, God.

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:57.750
Call 911.

01:00:57.752 --> 01:01:00.353
- Call 911!
- Do not call 911.

01:01:00.355 --> 01:01:01.456
Oh.

01:01:05.793 --> 01:01:07.797
Okay, honey. Come on.

01:01:09.063 --> 01:01:10.132
Let's go.

01:01:11.799 --> 01:01:13.002
Thank you.

01:02:40.956 --> 01:02:43.723
Where were you last night?

01:02:43.725 --> 01:02:46.025
I fell asleep in the car

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:47.826
with the garage door wide open.

01:02:47.828 --> 01:02:50.496
- Oh, my God.
- I had an accident last night.

01:02:50.498 --> 01:02:51.764
You know what, you know what,
I can't.

01:02:51.766 --> 01:02:52.898
I'm sorry. I just...

01:02:55.002 --> 01:02:57.670
- Hey, goodbye, girls.
- Goodbye, mom.

01:02:57.672 --> 01:02:58.804
- Love you.
- Have a good day.

01:02:58.806 --> 01:03:00.542
- Okay, love you.
- Bye.

01:03:05.514 --> 01:03:08.014
<i>So how much to fix it?</i>

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:10.319
- <i>It's got a lease or own it?</i>
- <i>I lease it.</i>

01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:14.154
Approximately 1600.

01:03:14.156 --> 01:03:15.721
- 1600?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:15.723 --> 01:03:17.157
Are you kidding me? Why so much?

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.628
Hang on.

01:03:54.596 --> 01:03:56.829
Hello, my name is Doris.

01:03:56.831 --> 01:03:58.234
<i>May I help you?</i>

01:03:59.801 --> 01:04:01.668
Uh, yeah.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.240
Hi, Doris. Um...

01:04:07.976 --> 01:04:09.742
I... I'm a driver.

01:04:09.744 --> 01:04:11.911
<i>Uh, I had an accident.
My name is...</i>

01:04:11.913 --> 01:04:15.150
Please place your thumb
anywhere on my screen.

01:04:18.587 --> 01:04:20.286
Thank you, Leonard Moore

01:04:20.288 --> 01:04:23.023
X-rating 2.86.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.592
Uh, I'm here a... about...

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:28.328
Email sent regarding
the back bumper issue.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.764
Yes.
A... and also the tail light.

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:33.833
Did you receive the text
response from DriverX support?

01:04:33.835 --> 01:04:37.003
I did, uh, but even though
the trip was completed

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:40.273
and there were no riders,
I was still on the job.

01:04:40.275 --> 01:04:41.608
It was green.

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.175
Be that as it may

01:04:43.177 --> 01:04:45.645
because you had already
completed the trip

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:49.148
<i>you'll need to submit a claim
with your personal insurance.</i>

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:52.284
Doris, I'd like to speak
to a manager.

01:04:52.286 --> 01:04:54.186
There is no manager.

01:04:54.188 --> 01:04:57.223
We are all simply members.

01:04:57.225 --> 01:04:59.858
That's great. Um, I... I need
to talk to someone.

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.998
Uh... uh,
someone who can help me.

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:06.469
Please walk this way.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:38.163
Hello, Leonard.
I know why you're here.

01:05:38.165 --> 01:05:41.534
Let me begin by saying, your
profile is quite impressive.

01:05:41.536 --> 01:05:44.938
A 100% acceptance rate.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.507
You're on pace to break
the great acceptance streak

01:05:47.509 --> 01:05:50.713
held for over 6 months
by a partner in Seattle.

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:53.645
<i>I can see why you're confused</i>

01:05:53.647 --> 01:05:56.382
but technically,
you weren't working for us

01:05:56.384 --> 01:05:59.485
when you backed the Prius
into that pole.

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:01.954
<i>We are meeting here today
as peers, Leonard.</i>

01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:03.389
I am not your boss.

01:06:03.391 --> 01:06:07.092
I'm only your boss when you have
riders in your vehicle.

01:06:07.094 --> 01:06:10.195
At all other times,
you're working for yourself.

01:06:10.197 --> 01:06:11.630
She threw up in my car.

01:06:11.632 --> 01:06:14.933
And you have been awarded
an X bonus

01:06:14.935 --> 01:06:17.272
along with a free
car wash coupon.

01:06:19.074 --> 01:06:22.041
<i>You are at the leading edge
of a movement</i>

01:06:22.043 --> 01:06:24.376
<i>the Gig Revolution.</i>

01:06:24.378 --> 01:06:27.212
No more boss,
no more 9:00 to 5:00.

01:06:27.214 --> 01:06:30.051
Work as you please.
True freedom.

01:06:32.087 --> 01:06:35.020
We value our partners here
at DriverX.

01:06:35.022 --> 01:06:37.924
We would be nothing without you.

01:06:37.926 --> 01:06:40.763
<i>And you are the type of partner
that we hold dear.</i>

01:06:42.697 --> 01:06:44.633
<i>Thank you, Leonard Moore.</i>

01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:47.436
Thank you.

01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.880
Hey.

01:07:01.882 --> 01:07:02.951
Hey.

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:23.973
- Can I do anything?
- I don't know, can you?

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:26.641
Hmm?

01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:30.275
Sorry. I got it.

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:31.446
How was work?

01:07:34.648 --> 01:07:35.817
Not bad.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.788
Sort of weird, actually.

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.456
<i>Josefina started this cleanse.</i>

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:45.257
And, I don't care, really.

01:07:45.259 --> 01:07:48.061
It's just, I just find it
a little ironic

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.695
'cause she's so competitive,
you know.

01:07:49.697 --> 01:07:51.496
So I just feel like
if I start one now

01:07:51.498 --> 01:07:52.931
it just seems like
it's in reaction to her.

01:07:52.933 --> 01:07:54.002
So, what?

01:07:56.971 --> 01:07:59.404
I don't know.
It's a work thing.

01:07:59.406 --> 01:08:02.544
I don't... feel like
talking about it.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.562
<i>What? It's not even open.</i>

01:08:23.264 --> 01:08:25.567
- You don't have to open it.
- Of course, you do.

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:28.102
They would have called.

01:08:38.578 --> 01:08:40.014
I'm sorry.

01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:45.886
I don't wanna live like this.

01:08:48.589 --> 01:08:49.822
What do you mean?

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:53.562
It means, I don't wanna live
like this anymore.

01:08:54.795 --> 01:08:55.795
Poor?

01:08:55.796 --> 01:08:58.334
Uh, uh, no. Not just that.

01:09:00.267 --> 01:09:01.667
We don't get to see each other.

01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:03.368
I... I barely saw the kids
as it is.

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:05.438
<i>I just, I feel like
we're work shifts and it's...</i>

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:08.041
Okay. What...
So... so what do you want?

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:11.411
Do you want me to work
or do you want me to be around?

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:14.380
I want you to get a job!

01:09:14.381 --> 01:09:16.384
- I have a job!
- A real job!

01:09:17.919 --> 01:09:19.952
DriverX isn't a job, okay?

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:21.886
I... I don't know what it is.

01:09:21.889 --> 01:09:23.323
You know what?

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.060
I'm gonna go off
to my non-job job.

01:09:28.062 --> 01:09:30.529
And you know what I'd like
now that I am working?

01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:32.131
How about you not leave
your shit all around the house?

01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:33.899
<i>Why don't you pick up after
yourself? Believe it or not</i>

01:09:33.901 --> 01:09:35.435
<i>there are 2 people working
in this house.</i>

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.135
Oh, really?
'Cause I'm so messy.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:39.270
You have no clue.

01:09:39.273 --> 01:09:41.707
And I tell you what,
if I have a little extra time

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:43.876
I will put a juice machine
right next to the bed

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.545
and shove a fucking tube
right up your ass.

01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:47.078
<i>Because if I have to hear
one more time</i>

01:09:47.081 --> 01:09:48.279
about you going on a cleanse

01:09:48.282 --> 01:09:49.549
without actually
going on a cleanse

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:50.948
I'm gonna lose my shit.

01:09:50.951 --> 01:09:52.350
Really? 'Cause it
kind of looks like

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:54.288
you're already losing your shit.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:58.192
Fuck. Hey.

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.868
I... What do you wanna do
about dinner?

01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:08.871
I don't know.

01:10:10.338 --> 01:10:11.473
Figure it out.

01:10:19.047 --> 01:10:21.383
There's lasagna and salad
leftover in the fridge.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.256
<i>Tom.</i>

01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:40.225
- I knew you'd come.
- <i>Hey, man, you alright?</i>

01:11:40.227 --> 01:11:42.260
Ah, I'm better now, man.

01:11:42.262 --> 01:11:43.798
- Get on in, man.
- Okay.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.933
Oh.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.702
There you go. Buckle up.

01:11:49.704 --> 01:11:50.739
God!

01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:54.308
That place was fucking crazy.

01:11:55.509 --> 01:11:56.943
- Was it?
- Yeah, man.

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:59.311
It was, like,
pretty hardcore aggressive.

01:11:59.313 --> 01:12:01.413
- And...
- Like, uh, crazy what?

01:12:01.415 --> 01:12:03.015
They're doin' crazy shit
or what?

01:12:03.017 --> 01:12:05.051
I fucking got in there,
they fucking grabbed me.

01:12:05.053 --> 01:12:06.085
Like they grabbed your nuts?

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:07.953
No, they like grab you
and they're like

01:12:07.955 --> 01:12:10.957
"Hey, you want to get
special dance in VIP room?"

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.792
- Oh, that's hard to pass up.
- Exactly my sentiment.

01:12:13.794 --> 01:12:16.028
So I was, like, yeah, I'll go.

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.663
So I went with her into
the dance room, in the VIP room

01:12:18.665 --> 01:12:20.332
and she's, like, dancing
and being, like, all

01:12:20.334 --> 01:12:21.501
grabby and everything.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.435
And then she, like,
started talking to me

01:12:23.437 --> 01:12:24.970
about the fees for options.

01:12:24.972 --> 01:12:27.305
And she was, like,
"Uh, we can go

01:12:27.307 --> 01:12:30.342
to where the manager
can't see us for 700 bucks."

01:12:30.344 --> 01:12:31.844
- $700?
- Yeah.

01:12:31.846 --> 01:12:35.014
And I was like, "No. Wh... what
the fuck you talking about?"

01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:36.181
She's talking about
having sex with you.

01:12:36.183 --> 01:12:38.184
No. That's what
she makes it seem like

01:12:38.186 --> 01:12:39.484
and I was thinking, you know

01:12:39.486 --> 01:12:41.921
I only came here with, like,
$60 in my pocket.

01:12:41.923 --> 01:12:45.390
So, I was like, nah,
I'm married, which I am.

01:12:45.392 --> 01:12:47.659
And I probably shouldn't be
going to strip clubs

01:12:47.661 --> 01:12:49.862
in the first place, but,
you know, it was guys' night.

01:12:49.864 --> 01:12:51.197
- Guys' night.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:53.232
And we went to, like,
5 or 6 other places bef...

01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:57.670
What?

01:12:57.672 --> 01:12:59.404
Oh, shit!

01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:00.973
When I was in the room
with the girl

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:03.542
and she was talking to me

01:13:03.544 --> 01:13:05.411
my fucking wife started calling.

01:13:05.413 --> 01:13:07.380
- And I was like, "Shit."
- No.

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:09.549
Uh, s... sorry, honey.
I... I can't hear you.

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.283
It's too loud here
in Seventh Heaven.

01:13:11.285 --> 01:13:13.118
Hey, sugar.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.720
How much, how much money you
think we can spend right now?

01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:18.424
No, no, no.
She only said it was $700.

01:13:20.294 --> 01:13:22.862
So I just got like 20 bones

01:13:22.864 --> 01:13:25.430
and I got 'em in ones
and I chilled out

01:13:25.432 --> 01:13:28.600
and then
I got the fuck out of there.

01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:30.336
- Oh, wow, man.
- I don't know.

01:13:30.338 --> 01:13:32.070
I don't like strip clubs, man.

01:13:32.072 --> 01:13:34.640
They make me feel inadequate.

01:13:34.642 --> 01:13:36.311
Oh, shit. Hold on.

01:13:38.045 --> 01:13:39.744
Oh.

01:13:39.746 --> 01:13:42.316
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:44.483
Aww.

01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:45.751
Hello?

01:13:49.022 --> 01:13:50.456
What? Wow.

01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:54.659
What was that?
Did you hear that shit?

01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:56.528
Baby, are you there?

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.698
<i>It's not okay.</i>

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.501
- It... it's not okay?
- <i>It's not okay.</i>

01:14:02.503 --> 01:14:04.369
Oh, okay. Alright.

01:14:04.371 --> 01:14:06.905
Uh, I'm... I'mma be there,
uh, super quick.

01:14:06.907 --> 01:14:08.674
I'll be there
in, like, 2 minutes or so.

01:14:08.676 --> 01:14:11.277
<i>Oh, I don't feel good.</i>

01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:13.578
- <i>I don't feel very...</i>
- Oh, no.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.081
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:17.085
- <i>Come home.</i>
- <i>Fuck.</i>

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:20.653
She went on a girls' night.

01:14:25.526 --> 01:14:28.594
Of course,
she's fucking wasted, man.

01:14:28.596 --> 01:14:30.528
Oh, alright.

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:32.530
- Uh, third house on the right.
- Alright.

01:14:32.532 --> 01:14:33.634
Ah.

01:14:36.771 --> 01:14:39.404
Oh, uh, shit.
I almost forgot.

01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:41.640
Uh, new music. Mix tape.

01:14:41.642 --> 01:14:42.975
- Alright.
- Oh, hey, thanks, man.

01:14:42.977 --> 01:14:45.043
Cool.
Hey, uh, listen to it, okay?

01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:46.714
Talk to you soon.

01:14:47.882 --> 01:14:50.850
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:14:50.852 --> 01:14:54.386
- Uh, fuck.
- You okay?

01:14:54.388 --> 01:14:56.988
Ah, shit.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:59.225
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.
I got this.</i>

01:14:59.227 --> 01:15:01.226
<i>I got it. Thanks, Leonard.</i>

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:32.457
<i>I think I met a guy
who does voices for the show.</i>

01:15:32.459 --> 01:15:33.958
<i>Which character?</i>

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.362
<i>Uh, I can't remember.</i>

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:38.532
- Maybe Lovie Loser.
- Maybe.

01:15:40.067 --> 01:15:42.734
Hors d'oeuvres, ladies?

01:15:42.736 --> 01:15:43.838
Hey.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:45.840
Oh!

01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:53.345
Thank you.

01:15:53.347 --> 01:15:54.880
I didn't pick 'em up
till quarter to 6:00

01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:56.681
That's why they're watching TV.
I woke up late.

01:15:56.683 --> 01:15:58.216
I didn't know where I was,
but they're good.

01:15:58.218 --> 01:15:59.754
Everything is great.

01:16:05.526 --> 01:16:08.230
- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah. I am.

01:16:12.365 --> 01:16:13.868
Any particular reason?

01:16:15.602 --> 01:16:17.138
Uh, I can't.

01:16:19.874 --> 01:16:21.076
I don't know.

01:16:28.615 --> 01:16:30.551
How much did you make
last night?

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:37.324
I'm tired of you
asking me that...

01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:40.695
...but I still love you.

01:16:41.562 --> 01:16:43.498
I'm sorry. You're tired?

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:46.532
- I'm concerned.
- <i>I know.</i>

01:16:46.534 --> 01:16:48.070
You're always concerned.

01:16:49.236 --> 01:16:51.903
But, I still love you.

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:54.806
Why the fuck are you
talking to me like that?

01:16:54.808 --> 01:16:58.042
You're angry,
but I still love you.

01:16:58.044 --> 01:16:59.345
Okay, you know what?
What is this?

01:16:59.347 --> 01:17:03.681
Some technique you got
from some men's magazine?

01:17:03.683 --> 01:17:07.252
I don't like it
when you belittle me, but...

01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:08.386
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:08.388 --> 01:17:09.889
- I still love you.
- I still love you.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:11.927
- I know. I got it. Thanks.
- Alright.

01:17:19.032 --> 01:17:22.536
This is so s... stupid.

01:17:27.874 --> 01:17:29.810
Dinner will be ready in 10.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.236
I love you.

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:07.212
We are going to Bossa Nova.

01:18:07.214 --> 01:18:08.680
Sure. I can do that.

01:18:08.682 --> 01:18:10.181
And from this point on

01:18:10.183 --> 01:18:12.618
anywhere the girl
in the back decides.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.854
- Whoop!
- Okay.

01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:19.593
- So how's your night?
- It's good. Thank you.

01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:22.260
And yours?

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:24.498
Mm, it's goin' okay.

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:29.801
- You have a good voice.
- Oh.

01:18:29.803 --> 01:18:32.007
Um, thank you.

01:18:33.307 --> 01:18:37.042
Something like, uh...

01:18:37.044 --> 01:18:40.179
- Like...
- Something like a doctor?

01:18:40.181 --> 01:18:42.547
Doctor. Yeah.

01:18:42.549 --> 01:18:45.417
- You get that a lot.
- I do get that a lot.

01:18:45.419 --> 01:18:47.689
- That's why you said that.
- That is why I said that.

01:18:49.056 --> 01:18:52.390
- Are you a doctor?
- No. No.

01:18:52.392 --> 01:18:56.528
You said that with a subtext,
like, I wish.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:58.730
Uh, no, no, no. It just...

01:18:58.732 --> 01:19:01.000
Actually, I... I used to be
really queasy around

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.868
uh, blood, guts,
that sort of thing.

01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:05.373
I don't like it either.

01:19:06.773 --> 01:19:08.274
But then I had somethin'
happen to me

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:11.143
that, uh, changed it, actually.

01:19:11.145 --> 01:19:12.577
Really?

01:19:12.579 --> 01:19:15.648
- Was it a girl's period?
- What the fuck?

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.582
Uh, uh, no.

01:19:17.584 --> 01:19:20.286
No, it wasn't.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.688
- Was that a good guess?
- Yeah, that was a good guess.

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:23.689
That was a good guess.

01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:25.291
It was actually when my, my wife

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.893
gave birth to my first daughter.

01:19:27.895 --> 01:19:31.296
Uh, I'm in the operating room
and the... and the doctor said

01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:33.698
"Come around and take a look.
This is incredible."

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.871
And, uh, I said, "No, I...
I don't think I can do that."

01:19:38.539 --> 01:19:40.204
You know, I... I didn't know
if I was gonna be, like

01:19:40.206 --> 01:19:42.608
one of those pussy-ass guys who,
like, you know, just passed out

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:43.545
and, um...

01:19:44.712 --> 01:19:45.844
But I did.

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:48.415
I wound up comin' around
and takin' a look and...

01:19:51.118 --> 01:19:53.053
You know, what I saw was...

01:19:54.821 --> 01:19:57.424
You know, I'm... I'm... I'm not
particularly religious...

01:19:59.293 --> 01:20:00.759
...but...

01:20:00.761 --> 01:20:03.831
Did you see an angel?

01:20:05.465 --> 01:20:07.332
No, no.

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:09.471
But, but what I did see was...

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.043
I... I saw my baby
come out of my wife.

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:19.880
And when I saw her head crown...

01:20:21.147 --> 01:20:24.315
...it just hit me
like a ton of bricks.

01:20:24.317 --> 01:20:28.119
This is a miracle.
I mean, like a real miracle.

01:20:28.121 --> 01:20:30.225
How is this possible? How?

01:20:32.258 --> 01:20:34.225
How did I not know
about this before?

01:20:34.227 --> 01:20:36.427
It's crazy.

01:20:36.429 --> 01:20:40.498
I mean, a human body
coming out of a human body.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.237
Yeah. Unbelievable.

01:20:45.606 --> 01:20:48.273
So I... I, I...

01:20:48.275 --> 01:20:51.409
I... I mean, I... I almost
found God, you know?

01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:53.481
Uh, I mean, right there.

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:59.417
You did find God.

01:20:59.419 --> 01:21:03.891
Your child is a blessing.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.128
Trust me.

01:21:09.163 --> 01:21:10.996
The second one's
not too bad either.

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:18.005
And the wife.

01:21:38.392 --> 01:21:41.560
I was lost. They found me.

01:21:41.562 --> 01:21:43.694
- This is fucking incredible.
- You're a good man, Leonard.

01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:46.765
Oh, my God!

01:21:46.767 --> 01:21:49.201
<i>DriverX is after a shift
in thinking.</i>

01:21:49.203 --> 01:21:51.302
<i>They want the people
in the cities to realize</i>

01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:54.806
<i>that using DriverX
is less than owning a car.</i>

01:21:54.808 --> 01:21:58.042
But so what? The best minds
of the younger generation

01:21:58.044 --> 01:22:01.246
are... are flocking
to Silicon Valley

01:22:01.248 --> 01:22:03.881
and working their asses off,
but for what?

01:22:03.883 --> 01:22:05.384
<i>These kids,
they... they really think</i>

01:22:05.386 --> 01:22:07.418
<i>they're solving
a really hard problem.</i>

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.855
They're just actually
solving the easiest problem

01:22:10.857 --> 01:22:15.426
which is how do you extract
money from the middle class

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:19.700
and give it to some
obscenely rich Jew people.

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:52.997
Hey, man. Just listened
to your CD. It's awesome.

01:22:52.999 --> 01:22:55.167
<i>Oh?</i>

01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:56.201
Tom?

01:22:58.571 --> 01:23:02.006
<i>Ralph's. Ralph's bathroom.</i>

01:23:02.008 --> 01:23:03.911
Shit. Which one?

01:23:10.551 --> 01:23:13.385
- Tom.
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:23:18.392 --> 01:23:19.725
Come on, you gotta unlock
the door, Tommy.

01:23:19.727 --> 01:23:22.161
<i>Miracle. Ah, it's a miracle.</i>

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:24.462
Tommy, wake up.
You gotta unlock the door.

01:23:24.464 --> 01:23:26.698
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.802
<i>Fine.</i>

01:23:29.136 --> 01:23:30.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:33.141
- Oh?
- I got you. I got you.

01:23:41.382 --> 01:23:43.916
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on,
I gotta... I gotta request.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.184
- No, no, no...
- Come on, I gotta...

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:47.952
No, no, no, no.
This one's on me.

01:23:47.954 --> 01:23:50.891
Oh, thanks, man.

01:23:59.232 --> 01:24:00.368
You good?

01:24:02.169 --> 01:24:03.771
In heaven, Leonard.

01:24:05.739 --> 01:24:08.573
<i>You know, you could be like
Los Angeles lore.</i>

01:24:08.575 --> 01:24:12.109
Like, hey, you wanna see LA?

01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:15.382
Take a ride with Leonardo.

01:24:16.749 --> 01:24:20.085
That should be the rallying cry
of Angelenos everywhere

01:24:20.087 --> 01:24:24.021
<i>because you've earned this.</i>

01:24:24.023 --> 01:24:26.427
Because you, Leonard...

01:24:28.262 --> 01:24:32.363
...are every other dogs'
best friend.

01:24:32.365 --> 01:24:35.967
<i>You're that person, man.
Important.</i>

01:24:35.969 --> 01:24:38.737
The best DriverX ever.

01:24:38.739 --> 01:24:40.241
Thank you, my friend.

01:24:45.012 --> 01:24:46.414
Thank you.

01:24:49.282 --> 01:24:51.750
Hey, you okay? Tom?

01:24:57.156 --> 01:24:58.392
Don't worry.

01:25:00.893 --> 01:25:02.829
I'll get you home safe.

01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:07.466
- Alright, we got steps.
- Okay.

01:25:07.468 --> 01:25:08.800
- Ready, one.
- One.

01:25:08.802 --> 01:25:10.068
- Two.
- Two.

01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:19.644
- What?
- Girls' night out.

01:25:19.646 --> 01:25:22.780
Jesus. Don't you
guys ever go out together?

01:25:22.782 --> 01:25:24.718
Why would we do that?

01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:27.789
- Bingo.
- There we go.

01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:32.591
Okay.

01:25:32.593 --> 01:25:34.326
- Oh! It's okay.
- Sorry.

01:25:34.328 --> 01:25:36.431
Alright. One, two, three.

01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:18.670
Listen, take them
to this address.

01:26:18.672 --> 01:26:21.305
They are a Ukrainian rock band.

01:26:21.307 --> 01:26:24.710
They do not speak English.
Nothing.

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.912
Take them to hotel.

01:26:26.914 --> 01:26:28.116
Nowhere else.

01:26:29.282 --> 01:26:30.752
Good luck.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.293
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.

01:26:42.295 --> 01:26:44.061
No smoking in the car, please.

01:26:44.063 --> 01:26:46.698
Could... could you tell them
no smoking in the car?

01:26:49.136 --> 01:26:51.438
Really? Really, no English?

01:26:52.472 --> 01:26:53.704
No, thanks.

01:26:55.142 --> 01:26:56.174
Yeah.

01:26:56.176 --> 01:26:59.543
Sexy. Sexy, huh?

01:26:59.545 --> 01:27:01.479
What?

01:27:01.481 --> 01:27:03.748
- Sexy? No, you wanna...
- Sexy!

01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:06.184
- Sexy. Alright. Yeah.
- Sexy.

01:27:11.023 --> 01:27:13.759
Oh! Oh!

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:16.364
You want a strip club?
Strip club?

01:27:29.276 --> 01:27:31.579
- <i>Sexy!</i>
- <i>Sexy!</i>

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:53.198
Sexy! Oh!

01:27:55.002 --> 01:27:56.501
Hey! Hey!

01:27:56.503 --> 01:27:58.737
What the fuck!

01:27:58.739 --> 01:28:00.475
Get... get off of me!

01:28:02.676 --> 01:28:04.379
Get out of here!

01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:08.846
Get out! Get out of here!

01:28:31.271 --> 01:28:33.204
What is it?

01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:36.107
I... I, I can't take anything
if I don't know what it is.

01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:38.275
X.

01:28:38.277 --> 01:28:40.047
- Ecstasy?
- X.

01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:11.408
Whoo!

01:30:50.377 --> 01:30:51.646
<i>Nina!</i>

01:32:30.343 --> 01:32:34.045
"All children, except one,
grow up.

01:32:34.047 --> 01:32:35.579
"They soon know
that they will grow up

01:32:35.581 --> 01:32:38.416
"and the way Wendy knew
was this.

01:32:38.418 --> 01:32:39.917
"One day
when she was two years old

01:32:39.919 --> 01:32:41.920
"she was playing in a garden

01:32:41.922 --> 01:32:45.924
<i>"and she plucked another flower
and ran with it to her mother.</i>

01:32:45.926 --> 01:32:48.426
"I suppose she must have looked
rather delightful

01:32:48.428 --> 01:32:51.432
"for Mrs. Darling put her hand
to her heart and cried...

01:32:54.767 --> 01:32:57.038
"'...Oh, why can't you remain
like this forever?'

01:33:00.706 --> 01:33:04.309
"This was all that passed
between them on the subject

01:33:04.311 --> 01:33:07.114
"but henceforth, Wendy knew
that she must grow up.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.818
"You always know
after you are two.

01:33:12.886 --> 01:33:14.888
<i>Two is the beginning
of the end."</i>

01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:21.594
- You okay, Daddy?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:25.432
Yeah, Daddy loves you very much.

01:33:28.101 --> 01:33:29.570
I can take over.

01:33:34.106 --> 01:33:35.241
Okay.

01:33:46.052 --> 01:33:48.255
I don't think you should drive
so late, okay?

01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:54.058
2 o'clock,
and I'll turn into a pumpkin.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.262
Okay.

01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:08.409
Miranda, why don't you read
to your sister?

01:34:09.642 --> 01:34:10.844
Okay.

01:34:12.445 --> 01:34:14.581
Mommy, can you lay with me?

01:34:18.017 --> 01:34:20.685
I will in a minute,
okay, sweetie?

01:34:20.687 --> 01:34:21.989
Okay.
