09:21.440 --> 09:24.720
and she wants to know
what the toilet situation is in there.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.200
Tammy, Miranda?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.480
- It's just chips, Abby.
- Everyone deserves chips.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.720
Uh, it's not about chips.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.840
Margaret found this over on the island.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.120
Wow, that's a... cool earring, eh?

09:36.120 --> 09:37.760
Yeah. I've never seen
an earring like that before.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.200
OK, well, you have, because you were
wearing one exactly like it

09:40.200 --> 09:42.480
the morning you discovered Trent's body.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.280
Fuck! You know what's happened there?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.040
It was that massive kelp gull.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.440
Yeah. He must have
flown it over to the island.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.520
Look, I don't care
if you ever go over there,

09:51.520 --> 09:53.640
but if Margaret finds out
it's happening again,

09:53.640 --> 09:56.400
she's going to do more than
just give you a warning.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.960
Listen, have either of you ever
seen anyone else over on the island?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.520
No, because we
never even been out there.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.640
Oh, my God, whatever. Um, just go home.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.720
I'll leave you some chips.
They're shit chicken

10:11.720 --> 10:12.960
Thank you.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.240
- [Miranda] Fuck, Tammy!
- [Tammy] We'll be OK.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.280
Let's just go for a walk.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.480
[man screaming]

10:22.240 --> 10:24.160
Johnson, we got a KLOF out
on Skye O'Dwyer?

10:24.160 --> 10:26.200
- [man] Yes, sir.
- Commissioner,
I am telling you it's not her.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.240
Connell, get out of here.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.360
- [men exclaim]
- Jesus! Fuck!

10:29.360 --> 10:30.480
- Fuck!

10:30.480 --> 10:32.440
- Fuck me dead!
- Fucking hell!

10:35.640 --> 10:38.840
Jesus. Oh, my God. Someone get Dr Rahme
out of the locker cell!

10:38.840 --> 10:41.280
[Hastings] Jesus, Phil!
What happened, mate?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.040
- He's bleeding!
- Why is he not on the bus?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.280
- [Phil groaning]
- I don't know.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.880
- Or something's happened
to the fucking bus!
- Abby, get hold of that passenger list.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.040
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's been shot! It's a chest wound!

10:49.040 --> 10:50.840
The blood is from his tongue, Shane.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.760
[groans] His fucking tongue's
been cut out!

10:52.760 --> 10:55.320
- [Dulcie] Phil, you're OK.
Don't try and talk.
- That psycho fucking bitch!

10:55.320 --> 10:58.360
Don't try and talk, just nod.
Did you walk from the bus?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.560
Get back, Connell.
You're not part of this investigation.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.880
Shane, if he walked from the bus,
then it's probably still nearby!

11:03.880 --> 11:05.440
- Which bitch did this to you, mate?
- [screams]

11:05.440 --> 11:07.040
The killer could be on the bus, Shane!

11:07.040 --> 11:09.480
- [Aleyna] Coming through, please.
- Stay with me, Phil.
Get her out of here!

11:09.480 --> 11:11.040
She'll try and finish the job
her mate started.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.240
I'm a doctor.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.680
I have a duty of care
even to Phil fucking McGangus.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.960
Tip your head forward, Phil,
and keep breathing.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.600
Commissioner, the bus
hasn't arrived at its destination.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.080
- Phil, mate, has Skye O'Dwyer
hijacked the bus?
- Call Ray.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.720
- Detective, call Ray!
- Yeah.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.680
- Is it Skye O'Dwyer?
- The killer is a man, Shane!

11:25.680 --> 11:27.520
He was probably on the bus already.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.920
Was she on the fucking bus, mate?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.720
- He can't talk, Shane!
- Agh! [screams]

11:31.720 --> 11:33.760
Davo, get him to type on your phone.
Hurry up!

11:33.760 --> 11:36.400
[man] I don't know how!
Work just switched us over to Galaxies.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
Oh, shit! I switched it off!

11:38.000 --> 11:40.120
Phil, Phil, just fucking type into mine.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.920
- Where is the bus, Phil?
- [groans]

11:41.920 --> 11:43.520
- [Aleyna] Fuck!
- Is she executing the men?

11:43.520 --> 11:44.920
Come on, Tom, come on, come on.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.560
- Come on!
- Wake up, you pigeon-chested fuck!

11:47.560 --> 11:49.360
- [Aleyna grunts]
- It's Tom. Just text me.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Oh, my God!

11:50.360 --> 11:52.400
- [Hastings] Where's the bus?!
- G'day, it's Ray. Well, um...

11:52.400 --> 11:53.640
It's me on my voicemail.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.520
He's unconscious. Has someone
called a fucking ambulance?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.640
[Hastings] We need to find
that fucking bus!

11:58.640 --> 12:01.000
- [Aleyna] Stay with me.
- Come on.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.200
Come on, Ray.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.240
[Hastings] Listen up.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.080
At 1930 hours, 18 men and boys
boarded a bus out of Deadloch,

12:09.080 --> 12:11.120
headed for safety.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.760
In the intervening hours,
our prime suspect, Skye O'Dwyer,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.480
has hijacked that bus.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.320
Digital are pulling a location from
the phones as we speak, but, men...

12:20.320 --> 12:21.320
[phone buzzes]

12:21.320 --> 12:23.520
...we need to prepare ourselves
for the worst.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.040
We're gonna need to nut-up.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.720
We don't know what we're
going to find on that bus.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.280
This could be the Geeveston Party Bus
disaster all over again.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.480
[all complain indistinctly]

12:34.480 --> 12:36.760
I want everyone fully armed.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.960
Who knows what that psycho bitch
is capable of?

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
[man] Shit.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.320
OK, fellas, we need to move out
when their location comes in.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
So get yourselves ready,
'cause it's gonna get fucking ugly.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.680
[men shout indistinctly]

12:48.680 --> 12:51.760
What the fuck are you doing?
You're gonna get fucking caught in here.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.160
Oh, none of them
are going to come in here.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.760
They're all terrified of female urine.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.040
Well, what if I want to do a shit?
I don't want you fucking listening.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.880
Well, then I will pop on a song.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.080
- [murmurs] Ugh... My God...
- Come on, Tom, answer your phone.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.160
- What the fuck is
this fucking bus psycho up to?
- [phone rings]

13:03.160 --> 13:06.800
I don't know, but he's not taking them
on a hop-on, hop-off winery tour, is he?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.600
Oh!

13:08.600 --> 13:10.320
- Oh...
- [Abby] Just me, ma'ams.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.520
Here's a list of
all the passengers on the bus.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.640
I also stole Nadiyah's phone
from the police station.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.720
Abby, you cannot just steal a phone.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.640
OK, yes, but, also, you can't just
run an illegal investigation

13:19.640 --> 13:22.080
out of a toilet cubicle, ma'am.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.120
Well, OK, then.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.520
I just thought that Nadiyah might have
a tracking app for Tom,

13:25.520 --> 13:27.720
just like James used to have for me.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.520
- [door bangs]
- Oh!

13:29.520 --> 13:31.640
[Sven] Oh, whoops,
this is the ladies' bathroom.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.400
Oh, no, I had no idea.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.120
OK, so, William Carruthers' passport
hasn't been used since 2016.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.120
- What?
- Yeah. It's super weird.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.480
Big Eyes, you're absolutely sure that

13:40.480 --> 13:42.240
William Carruthers isn't
one of the bobbing bodies?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.800
Very sure. He disappeared
before the killer started killing.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.320
OK. OK. Uh...

13:46.320 --> 13:49.520
You two find out whatever you can
about William Carruthers' whereabouts.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.320
Our priority right now is
finding the people on the bus.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.480
- Oh, give me that phone.
- No.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.760
You're not going to guess
Nadiyah's password.
Let's start with the classics, 69 69 69.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.000
- It's Tom's birthday.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.360
Nadiyah's such a nice lady, isn't she?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.520
- [Sven] She is.
- Yeah, she is.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.480
I doubt she would have
a tracking app on...

14:03.480 --> 14:05.480
Ah, no. OK.
She does. There is it.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.760
[Sven] Mm. Anxious-attachment style.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.680
Oh, my God,
the reception in here is terrible!

14:09.680 --> 14:11.960
[Eddie] Alright.
Let's look at this passenger list.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.080
What have we got here?
Mike, Hunter, Dolph...

14:15.080 --> 14:17.960
We've got Ray... Ah...

14:17.960 --> 14:19.920
- [phone beeps]
- I got a location on Tom's phone.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.240
[Hastings] Right, fellas, listen up.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.000
Hurry up, Collins,
something's going on out there.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.040
What? Wait. No, that can't be right.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.840
What?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.120
Telco coordinates show

14:28.120 --> 14:30.560
the men are in the middle of the ocean,
headed to Melbourne.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.040
And, as suspected, so is Skye O'Dwyer.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.360
Her phone is on the boat too.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.280
- [man] Shit.
- That's right.

14:38.280 --> 14:43.480
Man-hijacker Skye fucking O'Dwyer
has the bus on the Bass Strait ferry.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.160
- [men exclaim angrily]
- Jesus fucking Christ!

14:45.160 --> 14:47.240
- What a fucking bitch.
- [Hastings] I know.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.920
She's fucking diabolical.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.520
Helicopters are standing by
to chopper us out to sea

14:51.520 --> 14:53.400
to rescue the men from that woman.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.560
OK, fellas, let's move out.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.880
[men shout and cheer]

14:57.880 --> 14:59.520
Oh, no. No, I don't want this, thanks.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.600
- I do... I don't want any of this.
- [Eddie whispers] Hey! Oi! Oi!

15:01.600 --> 15:02.960
- Go, Sven.
- [Hastings] Come on, fellas!

15:02.960 --> 15:06.040
- Call me, call me.
- [Sven] Oh... Um...

15:06.040 --> 15:07.080
- Go, go.
- OK.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.760
[sirens wail]

15:21.280 --> 15:22.880
[Eddie] So, according to Skye's
phone data,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.800
she left Deadloch and drove inland.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.320
And then she called Tom
and backtracked towards the coast.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.880
Right. And somewhere along
Settler Highway,

15:28.880 --> 15:33.120
her mobile started pinging off the same
phone towers as the phones on the bus.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.520
So, what? Skye's Subaru
just intercepted the bus

15:35.520 --> 15:38.320
and then she just
started travelling with the men?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.920
It looks that way.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.400
So, Skye did hijack the bus?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.160
No, no!

15:43.160 --> 15:44.880
Maybe. Uh...

15:44.880 --> 15:46.560
No. No.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.200
Skye is a hothead. She...

15:48.200 --> 15:50.160
She drove off angry,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.440
came to her senses,
called Tom to apologise,

15:52.440 --> 15:55.520
and then went to wherever the bus was.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.920
But why would she get on the bus?

15:57.920 --> 16:00.520
Look, maybe sh... I don't know.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.880
Let's just hope that the interception
point answers that question,

16:02.880 --> 16:05.080
because right now,
it makes no bumming sense.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.200
[slow humming]

16:16.840 --> 16:20.240
[Vic continues humming slowly]

16:26.240 --> 16:28.440
No. What's that tune?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.280
That's Happy Birthday again, hun.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.480
- Ah.
- Keep going. You're doing really well.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.080
- [chuckles]
- [door opens]

16:35.920 --> 16:37.960
You've been released. You're free to go.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.640
[women murmur happily]

16:40.920 --> 16:42.760
No. Just you.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.680
No, darling,
it's supposed to be everyone.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.240
Well, my goodness, I don't know how...

16:47.240 --> 16:48.720
This... This is a mistake.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.640
- Oh, bullshit.
- Darlings, I'll get you out of here.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.320
I won't rest until it happens.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.680
That fucking cunt.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.760
[Abby] So, no sign of him?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.040
OK, thanks.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.480
- [door opens]
- [Margaret] I'm fine.
I can see my car waiting.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.599
[exhales]

17:07.599 --> 17:09.920
[Abby] Excuse me, Mrs Carruthers?

17:11.040 --> 17:14.480
Mrs Carruthers, William's not in Ubud.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.240
Is there any chance
he never left Deadloch?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.880
Uh...

17:20.880 --> 17:23.000
Well, I... I don't see how.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.319
Abby, is he
a victim of the serial killer too?

17:27.319 --> 17:29.000
- Um...
- Is he in the lake?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.320
It's possible.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.040
My poor William.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.000
Thank you. Thank you for telling me.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah, hm.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.240
Um, sorry, ma'am,

17:43.240 --> 17:46.320
unfortunately, we don't have enough
resources to search the entire...

17:46.320 --> 17:47.920
Of course not. Of course.
No, I assumed as much.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.000
- ...the lake fully
to locate William's body.
- Don't apologise.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.960
But if you would like to
fund a search, then...

17:52.960 --> 17:57.200
I think that, um, the lake,
it's so deep,

17:57.200 --> 18:00.080
and, um, the resources
that it would take to search,

18:00.080 --> 18:02.240
and then, even then, it's likely
we'd never find him, would we?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.240
Well, obviously, it's up to you.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.080
Um, but if you'd...

18:06.080 --> 18:07.800
[engine starts]

18:18.520 --> 18:20.560
So, Collins, this bit of the road

18:20.560 --> 18:23.080
is where Skye met the men
and hijacked the bus?

18:23.080 --> 18:25.320
[Dulcie] Yeah, according to the telcos.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.960
Agh, my reception is...

18:27.960 --> 18:29.760
Ugh.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.680
So, where the fuck's her car, then?

18:31.680 --> 18:34.000
That's a good question.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.200
Ha!

18:35.200 --> 18:37.160
You can't take a bus
on the Bass Strait ferry.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.280
What?
OK, look, see, you can...

18:39.280 --> 18:41.200
- Hey, wh... Hold still!
- Yeah, OK, you can take...

18:41.200 --> 18:43.920
You can horse floats,
jet skis, amphibious cars,

18:43.920 --> 18:46.000
but you cannot take a full-sized bus.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.280
The bus isn't on the boat.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.440
[phone rings]

18:52.440 --> 18:54.280
What have you got for me, Sven?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.480
OK, my phone battery's about to die,
but super quick:

18:56.480 --> 18:58.320
Hastings' men stormed
the Bass Strait ferry,

18:58.320 --> 18:59.760
and you'll never believe it...

18:59.760 --> 19:01.080
The bus isn't on the boat?

19:01.080 --> 19:02.800
The bus isn't on the boat. Yeah.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.000
Fuck.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.560
- [softly] Hey, you got a phone charger?
- [woman] No, sorry, it's in the car.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.760
Uh, anyway, everyone seems
genuinely shocked by that.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.400
One of the cops
punched the side of a truck,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.920
which was, like, very masc of him.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.000
They did manage to find
Skye's car, though.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.200
Guess what was in the boot.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.920
Was it 19 mobile phones?

19:17.920 --> 19:19.480
It absolutely was, yes.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.000
So where the fuck are the men, then?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.640
Um, they're searching the ship
for them now.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.680
They're currently doing a sweep
of the onboard cinema.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.200
[Dulcie] Oh. Oh, the cinema?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.760
So, where does Hastings
think they're hiding,

19:27.760 --> 19:30.280
under the seats
like a bunch of old Jaffas?

19:30.280 --> 19:31.880
[silence]

19:31.880 --> 19:33.200
[both] Sven?

19:33.200 --> 19:34.800
- Sven?
- His battery's dead.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.720
Oh, fuck. Fuck, no!

19:36.720 --> 19:38.640
We fucked it, Collins.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.200
Oh, we fucked it!

19:40.200 --> 19:41.560
I knew I should have stayed with Ray.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.280
It's just like fucking Bushy
all over again!

19:43.280 --> 19:44.640
No, hey, it's not like Bushy.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.080
The killer's thrown him overboard.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.080
Ray's body will be fucking shark chum,

19:48.080 --> 19:49.880
just like Bushy's body
was fucking croc chum!

19:49.880 --> 19:52.400
- Ray is not going to be chum.
- He will be! He will be.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.800
The sharks will be
fucking chumming it

19:53.800 --> 19:56.640
up over my man's tight little bod
and his tight little butt,

19:56.640 --> 19:57.760
and his beautiful fucking...

19:57.760 --> 20:00.520
Stay away from me, Collins.
You'll get chummed too.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.080
Everyone I fucking care about
turns into fucking chum!

20:03.080 --> 20:04.760
- Stop saying "chum".
- Chum!

20:04.760 --> 20:06.800
- Stop it!
- Chum!

20:06.800 --> 20:08.040
[exhales]

20:09.680 --> 20:11.560
Do you really think...

20:11.560 --> 20:15.040
that 18 men were smuggled
onto the ferry in Skye's Subaru?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.080
I don't know.
Maybe she got the fucking boot involved!

20:17.080 --> 20:19.280
Oh, come on. Subarus are roomy.
They're not that roomy.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.640
Oh...

20:20.640 --> 20:21.800
Listen...

20:21.800 --> 20:23.280
[exhales]

20:27.080 --> 20:28.280
Look at me.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.240
The phones are in Skye's car.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.000
The people are on the bus.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.480
And the bus is not on the boat.

20:42.760 --> 20:48.160
Phil made it back to town on foot
and completely nude.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.880
Bus can't be that far away.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.080
Mona's is right up there. It's a servo.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.720
I'm too sad for a second pie, Collins.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.920
They might have vision of the road
from last night.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.480
Come on, chop-chop.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.880
- I need a grank.
- Yeah, well, grank at home.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.200
If you're gonna arrest me too,
you're gonna have to babysit Indi,

21:10.200 --> 21:11.560
'cause there's no-one else to do it.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560
Fay, I'm not here to arrest you.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.640
I need to ask you some questions
about Margaret's brother.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.960
The walk didn't work at all.
I'm stressing out.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.280
Margaret's going me because
I rejected her scholarship, right?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.480
- She's going to ruin my life!
- [Fay and Abby continue indistinctly]

21:24.480 --> 21:26.680
Margaret's not going to do anything
right now, sis. She's in jail.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.560
Let's just watch
the 2019 AFLW grand final.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.040
- It'll help you relax.
- [Abby] ...found Miranda's earring
on the island...

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
- Crows vs Carlton.
- Shh!

21:33.040 --> 21:35.440
- [Abby] ...I know the girls
have been out there.
- I'm dead meat, you see?

21:35.440 --> 21:37.960
[Fay] No, Abby. My kids didn't go
out there. That would be that kelp gull.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.240
Gets all about.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.400
Look, if anyone's been
out at the island, we need to know,

21:41.400 --> 21:43.160
because we're trying to find William.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.080
Fay, when was the last time
you saw William Carruthers?

21:46.080 --> 21:49.720
I don't know.
I reckon I haven't seen him since...

21:49.720 --> 21:52.000
That meeting about the island
six years ago.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.160
Why?

21:53.160 --> 21:56.720
Abby, is he the one doing these murders?
Did he attack Phil?

21:56.720 --> 21:59.160
Ted saw Phil running
past the glamping tents.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.680
He said he looked like
a human sacrifice.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.080
OK. Um...

22:03.080 --> 22:06.120
We think that the killer
may have hijacked the bus.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.360
- Shit! Tom's on that bus!
- [Miranda gasps]

22:09.360 --> 22:11.080
Tam, fuck!

22:11.080 --> 22:15.200
What if the dude we saw pissing
on the island that night Trent died

22:15.200 --> 22:16.760
is William Carruthers?

22:16.760 --> 22:19.600
No, it was probably just
a dodge abalone diver.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.920
Aunty Fay said the killer
was keeping a boat out there.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.280
Nah, that wasn't... That was just...

22:26.120 --> 22:27.400
Fuck!

22:27.400 --> 22:29.360
We saw a murderer piss, didn't we?!

22:29.360 --> 22:30.760
Shit! Come on!

22:30.760 --> 22:32.280
He could have 'em at the island!

22:32.280 --> 22:33.880
Where are you going? Tammy!

22:33.880 --> 22:36.400
Fay, can I ask, was it Carruthers Island

22:36.400 --> 22:39.080
that caused the fight
between William and Margaret?

22:39.080 --> 22:41.240
Yeah. According to Margaret,

22:41.240 --> 22:43.320
he wouldn't let us mob
anywhere near the island,

22:43.320 --> 22:44.800
and wouldn't sign it over.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.280
Why are you asking?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
I found this beanie
in William Carruthers' car.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.680
That's one of Aunty Joy's.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.760
But why would William Carruthers
have owned one of her beanies?

22:57.760 --> 22:59.680
Margaret said he didn't like us.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.560
I think William wanted to
give back the island, not his sister.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.800
I reckon Margaret's been
lying her ring off about it for years.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.120
You don't say?

23:09.480 --> 23:11.680
This is Dulcie Collins.
Leave a message.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.320
- [beep]
- Hi, ma'ams.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.960
I really feel like William Carruthers

23:14.960 --> 23:17.640
doesn't have anything to do with
these murders.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.560
I don't know where he is,
but Margaret does, and...

23:20.560 --> 23:22.760
she really doesn't
want him coming back.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.600
Wherever he is, he's not our guy.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.240
[Eddie] Just answer the question, OK?

23:41.240 --> 23:44.400
Are there any security cameras
around this joint?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.600
I don't know anything
about security cameras.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.440
OK, Mona, well, have you seen any buses
leaving Deadloch in the last 15 hours,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.680
specifically a white bus
with a blue trim?

23:52.680 --> 23:55.960
- A blue bus with white trim?
- No, a white bus with a blue trim.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.760
Are you sure it was white?
That's be very hard to keep clean.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.240
I am. I am incredibly sure, Mona, yep.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.040
No, I didn't see any buses last night.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.080
- OK. OK.
- [whispers] Fuck.

24:06.080 --> 24:10.120
Except for that white bus that
whizzed by last night, towards Deadloch.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.480
- Wait, towards?
- Shit a brick, Mona!

24:13.480 --> 24:14.520
Towards?

24:14.520 --> 24:18.080
I remember because
the driver was in a costume.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.280
What kind of costume?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.680
Ah, sorry, Ruth.

24:20.680 --> 24:21.880
I'll just serve Ruth.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.200
- Um, no, no. Stay back, Ruth.
- No, not now.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.640
[Mona] Ruth, how are you?

24:25.640 --> 24:27.880
Just have the petrol, thanks, Mona.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.120
Also, do you sell Fruit Tingles?

24:30.120 --> 24:34.560
Look, I've ordered some, but last week
the lolly truck went over in a hairpin.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.160
- What about Clinkers,
do you have Clinkers?
- OK, alright. Shush up, Ruth.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.160
What do you mean that the driver
was in a costume?

24:39.160 --> 24:41.880
Well, they were wearing a mask,
weren't they?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.840
- You tell us, Mona.
- What kind of mask?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.880
Fucking animal mask?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.000
A fucking "Point Break"
fucking Richard Nixon mask?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.320
A mask from the movie "The Mask" mask?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.640
What kind of mask?

24:49.640 --> 24:51.080
It was a gas mask.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.680
You don't see many of them.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.640
You don't, Ruth.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.160
He's gassed the men. That'd be
the fastest way to knock them out.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.720
Oi.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.360
Petrol lady, the... the passengers
on the bus,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.240
did they look awake
when you saw them, or... or...

25:05.240 --> 25:07.280
...or not... awake?

25:07.280 --> 25:10.320
I don't know.
I was chasing after the kindling sign.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.360
It blew halfway to Hobart.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.880
Do you want me to check
our security cameras?

25:16.880 --> 25:20.320
- You said you didn't know
anything about security cameras.
- Do we want you to check the se...?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.520
- Oh, fuck.
- [Ruth] Well, I don't.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.040
My husband Alan knows
how to take out the cassettes.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.720
But he's staying with his sister,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.320
because of the serial killer
in Deadloch.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.760
Have you heard about that?

25:29.760 --> 25:31.840
Abby, get to the Gas and Milk.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.160
I need you to look at
Mona's security footage.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.800
Rescuing a bunch of white boys.
How has this become my fucking day?

25:42.080 --> 25:44.320
Should we just tell the cops?
Let them deal with it.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.360
No! We've got too much at stake
to get done for trespassing.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.080
And, at this point, I only trust you,
all the aunties, and...

25:51.080 --> 25:52.280
Kevin the seal.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.560
True. Plus, we're saving the dudes now,
anyway.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.800
Yeah, so everyone can shut up.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.120
This is actually pretty big of us.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
Mm.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.160
[starts engine]

26:13.280 --> 26:16.800
[Dulcie] OK, so if he's gassed the men,
they're probably still alive.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.560
There's only one road
in and out of town,

26:18.560 --> 26:20.440
so, where's he taken them?

26:20.440 --> 26:24.040
Now, the bus that Mona saw
was headed towards Deadloch.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.160
So, obviously, somewhere,
it turned around and backtracked.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.800
- What does that mean?
- I don't know! OK?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.080
I am very fucking stressed.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.040
Well, there's been no sight of the bus
in Deadloch,

26:31.040 --> 26:33.680
so I think it's still in the area
between town and Mona's.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.120
[Eddie] Yeah, but where, Collins?

26:35.120 --> 26:38.160
It's bush on one side and fucking
vertical cliff and ocean on the other.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.400
[phone rings]

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
Sven.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
Hi. OK, lovely woman
lent me her charger.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.000
- Thank you so much!
- [woman] Not a problem at all!

26:44.000 --> 26:46.720
So, Hastings' men couldn't find
a single trace of Skye or the men

26:46.720 --> 26:48.480
on the Bass Strait ferry.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.080
Hastings now says that
the men are still on the bus.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.920
- Mm.
- Yeah. Fuck. Duh.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.040
I can give you a lift.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.920
- [woman demurs]
- No, I'm driving that way anyway.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.640
Sorry. Yeah, They realised that you
couldn't even take a bus on the ferry,

26:58.640 --> 27:02.240
which, like, feels like a conversation
you'd have beforehand, but, um...

27:02.240 --> 27:04.680
Hastings is briefing the men now.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.280
They're sourcing infrared cameras.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.960
[Eddie] What the fuck's happened there?

27:07.960 --> 27:08.960
...sniffer dogs.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.160
They're bringing in bees,
those biosecurity bees from the airport.

27:12.160 --> 27:16.160
Oh, and, yeah, Dulce, uh,

38:11.400 --> 38:13.640
I can't hear you,
but I think you know her, Dulce.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.280
Dulce?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.480
[Miranda] Tom!

38:19.480 --> 38:21.640
- [Tammy] Any kidnapping
happening out here?
- [Miranda] Mike?

38:21.640 --> 38:23.400
Other... dudes?

38:23.400 --> 38:24.920
[Tammy] Come on. There's no-one here.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.560
Let's go before an old-timey ghost
possesses us.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.120
[Margaret, faintly] Darling...

38:30.280 --> 38:32.400
- Shit.
- Mrs Carruthers?

38:32.400 --> 38:35.120
- [struggles to breathe]
- [Tammy] Sis, sis, look!

38:35.120 --> 38:36.600
Tiger!

38:36.600 --> 38:39.560
Fuck! She's been bitten!
Has your phone got reception?

38:39.560 --> 38:41.480
[Tammy] Nup. Nothing.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.760
[Margaret wheezes]

38:42.760 --> 38:44.320
OK, go on, suck the poison out!

38:44.320 --> 38:46.560
- No, I'm not sucking the poison out.
- Well, I'm not sucking it out!

38:46.560 --> 38:48.160
You don't suck poison out!

38:48.160 --> 38:50.080
So, what? We piss on her?

38:50.080 --> 38:52.280
No, we immobilise her until help comes.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.880
Who's gonna help us?

38:53.880 --> 38:56.000
- This dude?
- Um...

38:56.000 --> 38:59.440
Mrs Carruthers,
you've been bitten by a tiger snake.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.840
So stay calm.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.680
How are we gonna
get her back to the boat?

39:03.680 --> 39:04.840
I'll get her down.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.360
- [both grunt]
- [Tammy] Come on!

39:08.360 --> 39:11.120
[both groan]

39:11.120 --> 39:15.280
I'll carry you down to the tinny
like a dead ball.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.800
- Tammy, you can't!
- Yes, I can!

39:17.800 --> 39:19.680
Because I'm cut as shit.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.840
And I'm a fucking exceptional
young lady!

39:22.840 --> 39:24.600

39:24.600 --> 39:25.840
Tammy...

39:26.840 --> 39:28.640
Those runners...

39:28.640 --> 39:31.160
Those are from the painting
at her house.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.520
Those are...

39:32.520 --> 39:34.120
William Carruthers' runners.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.160
What exactly are you
doing out here, Margaret?

39:39.160 --> 39:41.880
[Tammy] What the fuck?
She's digging him up!

39:41.880 --> 39:43.080
Ugh!

39:43.080 --> 39:45.480
Fucking shame job, Margaret!

39:45.480 --> 39:46.680
Ugh!

39:51.400 --> 39:53.880
It wasn't him that
didn't want us coming out here.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.200
It was you.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.840
[wheezes, speaks indistinctly]

39:57.840 --> 40:01.600
You killed your own brother

40:01.600 --> 40:03.920
instead of giving back our land?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.160
I...

40:05.160 --> 40:07.440
We didn't even want the whole thing!

40:07.440 --> 40:10.280
I mean, of course we fucking did, but...

40:10.280 --> 40:12.560
We were willing to share!

40:12.560 --> 40:14.320
- [cocks gun]
- Look out!

40:14.320 --> 40:15.320

40:40.440 --> 40:42.080

40:43.600 --> 40:45.680
Yeah, sis.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.320
That racist is dead.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.320
Ah, yeah, thanks, Hannah.

40:58.520 --> 41:01.560
You said that was Louise McEwan. W...

41:01.560 --> 41:03.160
What's going on over there?

41:03.160 --> 41:04.640
I don't know, ma'am.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.040
[Dulcie] No, I...

41:06.040 --> 41:07.800
[quietly] Is that the one
that Collins...

41:08.840 --> 41:11.320
Um, I think so.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.640
OK, thanks.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.160
Uh... Uh, thank you. Bye. Bye.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.200
[sighs]

41:21.200 --> 41:23.120
- Um...
- Oh, the new Adele album!

41:23.120 --> 41:24.440
Yeah! Is that right?

41:24.440 --> 41:25.440
- Very good.
- OK.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.400
Uh, so, my friend Hannah, who...

41:29.640 --> 41:32.920
Yes, yes, she is the woman that
I had an affair with, OK?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.360
Let's move on.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.080
Uh, so, Louise McEwan was a sex worker.

41:37.080 --> 41:40.360
And she was tranquilised and strangled
just like our victims.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.640
So, I thought the case had gone cold.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.920
But, apparently, a few years ago,
another sex worker came forward,

41:45.920 --> 41:48.200
and she'd been attacked around
the same time, and in the same manner.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.160
But she managed to fend him off

41:50.160 --> 41:52.760
and provide a description
of the attacker.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.920
Maybe the name Louise McEwan
is just a coincidence,

41:54.920 --> 41:57.360
but Hannah's sending through
an Identikit image now.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.520
To your phone, Abby,
because my reception is really crappy.

42:00.520 --> 42:04.160
But, listen, our killer isn't
targeting female sex workers

42:04.160 --> 42:06.960
like Jacko the Bondi Ripperoo
in Sydney, is he?

42:06.960 --> 42:08.480
He's targeting dog-shit men.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.640
So...

42:11.280 --> 42:14.440
What? What?

42:14.440 --> 42:16.080
They're still undesirables.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.480
Exactly, ma'am.

42:17.480 --> 42:21.080
Oi, psychic twins, let me in.
Involve me.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.440
Serial killers who target sex workers

42:23.440 --> 42:26.320
often believe they have a mission
to eliminate society's undesirables,

42:26.320 --> 42:27.680
people who are...

42:27.680 --> 42:30.320
who are traditionally deemed to be
morally reprehensible:

42:30.320 --> 42:31.760
sex workers, gay people.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.800
OK.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.320
But society's changing.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.800
Maybe our killer
got himself a new mission.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.840
- Shitbags.
- Dog-shit men.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.760
When did this, um...

42:45.760 --> 42:47.320
When did this Sydney stuff happen?

42:48.320 --> 42:51.120
Oh, look, it was years ago,
and I was in a really bad...

42:51.120 --> 42:53.440
- The murders, not the fucking affair.
- ...vulnerable place, and I...

42:53.440 --> 42:55.600
Right, uh... Uh, OK.
So, that was...That...

42:55.600 --> 42:57.120
The last attack was
five and a half years ago.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.600
- OK, well, that fits the timeline.
- Mm-hm.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.280
- OK.
- So, what are we thinking, the...

43:00.280 --> 43:02.960
the Sydney killer,
he moved to Deadloch, he...

43:02.960 --> 43:04.800
he got a new MO,

43:04.800 --> 43:06.520
had a little bit of a fucking revamp?

43:06.520 --> 43:07.880
Is that what we're thinking?

43:07.880 --> 43:10.200
I mean, Deadloch is a place
to reinvent yourself.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.520
What did you say?

43:16.520 --> 43:17.640
[rustling]

43:17.640 --> 43:19.360
What was that?

43:19.360 --> 43:20.840
Collins, grab your torch.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.680
- Grab your torch!
- Yeah.

No, Skye, in Sydney,
when I was your pastry chef,

45:01.120 --> 45:04.800
you taught me about feminism
and about toxic masculinity,

45:04.800 --> 45:06.960
and it changed my whole outlook.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.880
You could see that
I was struggling with my faith,

45:09.880 --> 45:11.120
and with my purpose.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.720
You said, "Move to Deadloch, Ray.
Have a little tree-change."

45:13.720 --> 45:16.600
You know, "Come in and work with Mum."
Do you remember? Eh?

45:16.600 --> 45:19.320
It's just so funny
how it all turned out.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.400
And then your dad was my first mission,
which was just so special.

45:22.400 --> 45:23.480

- Yeah?

the Mt Mountain National Park
