WEBVTT

00:09.527 --> 00:12.519
Well, listeners, flu season
is upon us again.

00:12.687 --> 00:13.881
As is customary,

00:14.047 --> 00:18.120
KACL is offering its employees
and their families free flu shots.

00:18.327 --> 00:21.080
Now, in order to show the importance
of getting a flu shot,

00:21.287 --> 00:24.006
I am going to put aside
my lifelong fear of needles

00:24.167 --> 00:27.637
and be inoculated right here
over the air when we come back.

00:29.327 --> 00:31.716
I've been sitting out here
a half an hour. I got places to go.

00:31.887 --> 00:34.117
Well, Dr Claman is on his way, Dad.

00:34.327 --> 00:35.919
Frasier, are you really
afraid of needles?

00:36.087 --> 00:38.317
Not really. I just say that
to encourage people that are.

00:38.487 --> 00:39.636
Well, they can use the help.

00:39.847 --> 00:41.963
You know, those needles they use
are about this long,

00:42.127 --> 00:44.402
- and if it hits a nerve when it's going...
- Stop it, Roz.

00:44.607 --> 00:47.167
Shots are perfectly harmless.
You got nothing to worry about.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.562
Oh, sure, you hear
the occasional story

00:49.727 --> 00:51.957
about someone getting
an air bubble in their vein

00:52.127 --> 00:55.756
or the needle getting stuck in a bone
and the tip breaking off,

00:56.167 --> 00:57.919
but that's the exception.

00:58.127 --> 00:59.799
Oh, that's it. We're out of here.

01:00.007 --> 01:02.441
But what about my flu shot?
I always get a flu shot.

01:02.647 --> 01:05.525
You're not getting one today. You told
me you'd drop me off at McGinty's.

01:05.687 --> 01:07.518
Now, I told Duke I'd meet him
at 5:00 sharp,

01:07.687 --> 01:09.439
and he pouts if I'm not there on time.

01:09.647 --> 01:11.285
Sits there with his bottom lip
stuck out

01:11.447 --> 01:14.325
and eats all the Brazil nuts out of the
bowl because he knows I like them.

01:14.527 --> 01:16.199
So come on, let's go.

01:16.367 --> 01:20.360
It's nice to know men in bars still settle
their disputes the old-fashioned way.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.364
- Dr Crane.
- Oh, Dr Claman.

01:22.527 --> 01:24.279
Sorry I'm late.
My last patient was a bleeder.

01:24.447 --> 01:26.039
Oh.

01:27.007 --> 01:29.885
- Fifteen seconds.
- Where are my manners?

01:30.047 --> 01:32.242
Perhaps... Perhaps you should
get inoculated first.

01:32.447 --> 01:34.005
I already had my shot,

01:34.167 --> 01:36.965
but I could sure use a check-up.

01:37.927 --> 01:39.076
- You're on.
- Oh, right.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.078
All right, folks. Uh, we're back, um.

01:42.247 --> 01:44.715
Joining us for this last minute
of our show is Dr Morris Claman,

01:44.887 --> 01:47.685
who is going to give me my,
my flu shot.

01:47.887 --> 01:49.445
But you know, what's the rush?

01:49.647 --> 01:51.365
Perhaps we'd be interested
in finding out

01:51.527 --> 01:54.405
what strains of flu
you've isolated this year.

01:54.607 --> 01:56.199
Primarily Singapore,
Rangoon and Malayan.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.516
Would you roll up your sleeve?

01:57.687 --> 02:00.201
And how do you suppose
they travelled here?

02:00.407 --> 02:01.886
No idea. Roll up your sleeve.

02:02.047 --> 02:04.356
Could it have been
a careless tourist?

02:04.527 --> 02:06.961
A, a baggage handler? A tainted wok?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.276
Dr Crane, we're almost out of time.

02:09.447 --> 02:10.925
You do wanna get that shot,
don't you?

02:11.167 --> 02:12.202
Yes, yes.

02:12.367 --> 02:15.086
All right. First, I'm just gonna swab
the area with a little alcohol,

02:15.247 --> 02:16.919
and then I'm gonna
give you the shot.

02:17.087 --> 02:18.122
There, that's done.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.285
Really?

02:20.447 --> 02:22.722
Well, that didn't hurt at all.

02:22.887 --> 02:26.163
This is the newly immunised
Dr Frasier Crane signing off.

02:26.367 --> 02:29.518
No, no, that was just the alcohol.
This is the needle.

02:29.687 --> 02:32.281
[SCREAMS]

02:36.447 --> 02:38.563
[CHATTER]

02:38.727 --> 02:39.796
NILES: Ah!

02:39.967 --> 02:42.117
Well, you're late.
All the tables are taken.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.198
No, there's one right there.
Dibs on that table.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.356
Roz, Niles was here first.

02:45.527 --> 02:47.643
No, but I'm meeting someone.
Please, guys?

02:47.847 --> 02:51.635
Oh, who is it? Another one of your
till-dawn-do-us-part relationships?

02:51.847 --> 02:54.839
No, twerp. This is a guy
who I think really has a chance.

02:55.047 --> 02:57.242
I can sense a lot of chemistry
between us.

02:57.647 --> 02:58.921
- Morris!
- Hi.

02:59.127 --> 03:01.721
Dear God! When did you two
even get out of my sight?

03:01.927 --> 03:04.760
You blacked out for 30 seconds
after he gave you the shot.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.638
Well, no one is budging.
We could be here forever.

03:07.807 --> 03:12.244
Well, Niles, I suppose
we could share a table.

03:12.407 --> 03:14.125
There's a couple of seats
available there.

03:15.807 --> 03:17.923
Oh, good Lord. We can't sit
with strange women.

03:18.127 --> 03:20.118
Why not?
We married strange women.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.561
It's... I know.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.156
- Really, I'm not in the mood.
- You know, just try to relax.

03:24.327 --> 03:26.397
Do you good to do something
spontaneous for a change.

03:26.567 --> 03:29.001
Yeah, I just... I just...
I wouldn't know what to say.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.840
- And besides, I'm a married man.
- Oh, Niles, please.

03:32.007 --> 03:33.838
When will you get rid
of that tired old excuse,

03:34.007 --> 03:37.204
your off-again, off-again
relationship with Maris? Come on.

03:37.407 --> 03:39.602
Hello, ladies. Excuse me.

03:39.807 --> 03:42.719
Would you mind terribly if we joined
you until another table opens up?

03:42.927 --> 03:44.326
Oh, please do.

03:44.527 --> 03:47.121
Oh, thank you so much.
That's very kind.

03:47.287 --> 03:51.644
I'm Frasier, and this gentleman dusting
for fingerprints is my brother, Niles.

03:52.927 --> 03:54.519
I'm Laura, and this is Beth.

03:54.687 --> 03:55.881
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

03:56.047 --> 03:59.084
Laura. Niles. Beth. Niles.

03:59.287 --> 04:01.562
What do you two ladies do?

04:01.727 --> 04:04.719
Oh, you don't wanna hear about it.

04:04.927 --> 04:05.916
- Well...
- Why don't we?

04:06.087 --> 04:08.521
Oh, it's just boring.
To the guys, anyway.

04:08.727 --> 04:11.958
Their eyes just glaze over
when the subject comes up.

04:12.167 --> 04:13.202
Oh, come on, come on.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.039
We're not your average bozos
off the street.

04:15.207 --> 04:17.118
Why don't you try us.

04:17.286 --> 04:19.482
We design kitchens.

04:21.406 --> 04:24.080
On the contrary, I am always ready
to debate the merits

04:24.247 --> 04:28.035
of downdraught cooktops
and ceramic-tile backsplashes.

04:28.207 --> 04:31.517
Whoa. Whose little boy
are you? Ha!

04:31.927 --> 04:33.042
As in just the mention

04:33.207 --> 04:36.404
of a double-bowl stainless-steel sink
with integral drainboards

04:36.567 --> 04:39.843
makes me hum
like a subzero freezer.

04:41.167 --> 04:44.603
You know, I think the key
to a good kitchen is comfort.

04:44.807 --> 04:47.879
Well, that's a whole current trend,
a living-room feel in the kitchen.

04:48.047 --> 04:49.480
Except, of course, with our father,

04:49.647 --> 04:52.115
who favours a kitchen feel
in the living room.

04:53.407 --> 04:55.238
That's funny.

04:56.727 --> 04:58.718
You're very witty.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.836
Thank you.

05:01.047 --> 05:03.117
- Look, Niles, a table's opened up.
- No, don't. Stay.

05:03.287 --> 05:04.845
Yeah, this is fun.

05:05.007 --> 05:07.123
Well, yes, it is fun, isn't it, Niles?

05:07.327 --> 05:09.158
Well, I told you it would be.

05:10.287 --> 05:11.640
Why don't I go get us some coffees.

05:12.207 --> 05:15.802
Uh, you know. I, uh. I uh...

05:16.927 --> 05:18.758
I'll help.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.082
I knew you'd panic.

05:21.247 --> 05:23.556
Well, I'm sorry. This is still
a little new for me.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.405
And besides, those two are
coming on to us.

05:25.807 --> 05:28.037
- You know, they are very attractive.
- I know.

05:28.207 --> 05:29.879
Maybe we should ask them out.

05:30.487 --> 05:33.047
On a date? We just met.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.926
Good point, Niles. Perhaps we should
go out with them a few more times

05:36.087 --> 05:37.998
before we ask them on a date.

05:38.527 --> 05:40.802
I just mean it seems a little rash.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.878
Well, that's exactly
why we should do it.

05:43.047 --> 05:44.844
We're being spontaneous today.
It will do us good.

05:45.047 --> 05:47.083
I am enjoying this, and...

05:47.247 --> 05:49.522
All right, I'll do it. Oh, but wait!

05:49.687 --> 05:51.120
We're making an assumption here.

05:51.327 --> 05:53.124
We could both be interested
in the same woman.

05:53.327 --> 05:54.999
Good Lord, I hadn't thought of that.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.646
All right, I'll declare...

05:57.607 --> 05:58.835
...l'm interested in Beth.

05:59.047 --> 06:00.958
Good, good.
We really dodged a bullet there.

06:01.407 --> 06:04.046
- Oh, which one's Beth?
- Oh, it's this one here.

06:04.207 --> 06:05.765
- Great!
- Okay.

06:08.807 --> 06:11.002
- And here we are.
- Yeah.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.397
Oh, Frasier, what a great apartment.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.956
Well, it's just a little something
I threw together.

06:16.127 --> 06:18.960
<i>You know, an objet here,
an antique there.</i>

06:20.367 --> 06:22.676
And there's the chair.

06:22.847 --> 06:25.156
Wow, he wasn't kidding.

06:25.367 --> 06:26.436
- Oh, hi!
- Dad.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.764
Dad, meet Beth Armstrong
and Laura Paris.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.116
- Martin Crane.
- How are you?

06:31.287 --> 06:32.845
Please have a seat. Sit down. Yeah.

06:33.007 --> 06:35.646
So you've been out
on a double date, huh?

06:35.807 --> 06:36.956
Well, sort of.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.078
We met this afternoon,
and the next thing we knew,

06:39.247 --> 06:42.239
your sons were taking us out to dinner
and then to the Seattle Rep.

06:42.447 --> 06:44.244
<i>- What'd you see?
- The Man Who Came to Dinner.</i>

06:44.407 --> 06:47.126
It's about a bad-tempered invalid
that moves into these people's house

06:47.287 --> 06:49.437
and just drives them crazy.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.285
- Comedy?
- I used to think so.

06:53.727 --> 06:54.921
Well, Mr Smart-Aleck,

06:55.087 --> 06:57.476
as a matter of fact,
I was just about to do a favour for you.

06:57.687 --> 06:59.917
Sherry and I can't make it
to the mountains this weekend,

07:00.127 --> 07:02.925
and the cabin's already paid for.
I thought maybe you'd like to use it.

07:03.127 --> 07:04.321
Oh, thank you, Dad.

07:04.487 --> 07:06.398
But Laura and I have plans
to go to the symphony.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.041
How about you, Niles?

07:08.247 --> 07:09.760
Beth and I are attending
an art opening.

07:09.927 --> 07:11.485
Well, if you hear of anybody...

07:11.647 --> 07:12.796
Nice meeting you, ladies.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.685
I'm really glad
the boys brought you over.

07:14.887 --> 07:17.276
And it's been a long time
since I said that and meant it.

07:19.207 --> 07:22.677
Well, Dad wasn't really thrilled
with the women we married.

07:22.847 --> 07:25.759
Yes. Fortunately, my taste
has improved a lot since then.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.480
I think your taste is fabulous.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.400
I'm referring to the brandy, of course.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.235
Velvety texture, great body.

07:33.407 --> 07:35.125
I'm not.

07:36.287 --> 07:39.836
Well, in honour of what happened
today, a toast.

07:40.287 --> 07:41.720
To winging it.

07:43.647 --> 07:47.276
What greater thrill is there
than going down an unknown path,

07:47.447 --> 07:49.358
not quite sure where it will lead.

07:49.527 --> 07:53.236
Just enjoying the way
that path wends and

07:53.407 --> 07:54.840
- NILES: And, and, uh...
- Uh-huh.

07:55.007 --> 07:59.683
And what it looks like and,
and where it goes off to, uh...

08:01.367 --> 08:03.358
Perhaps you should have left
a trail of bread crumbs

08:03.527 --> 08:05.006
before you started down that toast.

08:09.087 --> 08:11.647
You know, Frasier, I hate to see you
miss a weekend in the country

08:11.807 --> 08:13.877
just to take me to the symphony.
We can go next week.

08:14.047 --> 08:15.685
Wait a minute. I have a thought.

08:15.847 --> 08:17.883
Spirit of spontaneity
has carried us this far.

08:18.047 --> 08:19.685
Why don't we postpone our plans

08:19.847 --> 08:22.236
and all go to the cabin together
this weekend.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.039
- I'd love that.
- Sounds like fun.

08:26.527 --> 08:28.324
Well, then, it's settled.

08:28.527 --> 08:31.325
Saturday morning we ride
the high country.

08:31.807 --> 08:33.399
Say, you two have been here
five minutes,

08:33.567 --> 08:35.046
you haven't seen
Frasier's kitchen yet.

08:35.207 --> 08:38.005
- There's really nothing special...
- Let's let the professionals judge.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.880
- I am kind of curious to take a peek.
- Well, peek away. Peek away.

08:41.047 --> 08:45.882
Yes, someday, when you speak of his
faux-granite countertops, and you will,

08:46.287 --> 08:48.084
be kind.

08:48.647 --> 08:51.036
You are so funny.

08:52.927 --> 08:55.999
- What's going on?
- Well, things are going rather fast.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.885
Just going out this evening
was a big step,

08:58.047 --> 08:59.878
but something that involves
packing a suitcase,

09:00.047 --> 09:01.719
- and given my situation, I can't...
- Niles.

09:01.927 --> 09:03.918
When are you gonna stop
letting Maris be an anchor?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.197
That's the most tortured metaphor
you've come up with.

09:06.367 --> 09:08.437
- Maris, an anchor?
- Oh, please, Niles.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.603
Well, the woman is light weight,
for God's sake.

09:10.807 --> 09:12.684
Oh, just stop it.
You're changing the subject.

09:13.207 --> 09:15.163
This afternoon,
for the first time in your life,

09:15.487 --> 09:17.443
a perfectly lovely woman
whom you don't even know

09:17.607 --> 09:20.167
has agreed to go away with you
on a weekend.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.161
Isn't that exactly the kind of scenario
you've always dreamed of?

09:25.527 --> 09:27.245
Yes.

09:29.727 --> 09:32.844
And if you pass it up,
won't you regret it?

09:33.047 --> 09:34.765
Yes.

09:35.367 --> 09:40.316
Well, then, for once
in your timid, risk-free life,

09:40.487 --> 09:43.285
don't you think it's time
you grabbed for that brass ring?

09:43.487 --> 09:44.840
It's a great kitchen, Frasier.

09:45.007 --> 09:46.918
You guys feel like firing up
the cappuccino maker?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.406
Yes!

09:50.727 --> 09:54.242
Of course, if I have that much caffeine
at this hour, it'll probably be... Yes!

10:00.527 --> 10:02.165
FRASIER: Ah, there we are.

10:02.327 --> 10:03.840
After you, ladies.

10:04.007 --> 10:06.475
Oh, this place is perfect.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.162
And don't you just love this air?
Oh, I am going to sleep like a baby.

10:10.327 --> 10:11.476
Me too.

10:11.687 --> 10:13.962
Jeez, I hope you two don't mind
roughing it.

10:14.127 --> 10:15.765
There's no radio or television.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.606
Well, I guess we'll just have to make
our own entertainment.

10:18.767 --> 10:21.565
We should be able to manage that.
Come on, let's go look around outside.

10:22.807 --> 10:24.559
We'll start the fire,
and we'll be right out.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.843
- Yes.
- BETH: Okay.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.475
Well, Niles, I think things are going
rather well, don't you?

10:29.647 --> 10:32.036
Yes, they are, and thank you
for twisting my arm.

10:32.247 --> 10:33.566
Feel like a new man, do you?

10:33.767 --> 10:34.836
I feel like a new woman,

10:35.007 --> 10:37.157
and thank God
I remembered to pack one.

10:40.647 --> 10:44.037
You know, I just wish I were sure that
Beth and I were on the same page.

10:44.247 --> 10:45.999
I've forgotten how to
read all the signals.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.556
Niles, you don't need a decoder ring
to understand the phrase

10:48.727 --> 10:51.685
- "make our own entertainment."
- I know.

10:52.047 --> 10:55.357
Then again, there was that other
statement about sleeping like a baby.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.240
Exactly. They could be
thinking platonic.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.398
The two of them in one room
sleeping like babies.

11:00.607 --> 11:03.644
The two of us in another
crying like babies.

11:04.607 --> 11:06.086
Well, we're all adults.

11:06.247 --> 11:08.636
I suppose we could just
ask them what they have in mind.

11:08.807 --> 11:11.037
That'd be the worst thing we could do.
What if they're not interested?

11:11.207 --> 11:13.641
Then we'd all be embarrassed.
It would ruin the entire weekend.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.600
I know. Their luggage will tell us.

11:17.487 --> 11:21.878
We'll put my bag in with your date's
and your bag in with my date's.

11:22.047 --> 11:23.162
They'll see the mistake.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.800
- Right.
- How they correct it will tell

11:24.967 --> 11:27.527
with whom they were planning to
spend the night, each other or us.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.803
And either way, it'll all look like
a misunderstanding.

11:30.007 --> 11:31.998
You've done this before!

11:33.407 --> 11:36.046
Only on my honeymoon.
Now, hurry.

11:36.607 --> 11:40.077
Niles, this is idiotic.
We're both trained psychiatrists.

11:40.287 --> 11:42.198
Yes, and finally it's paying off.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.522
- Oh, Frasier, this place is heaven.
- FRASIER: Yes.

11:45.727 --> 11:49.402
Why don't we open up a bottle of wine
and watch the sunset?

11:49.567 --> 11:52.764
You know, the sun won't be setting
for a little while yet.

11:52.927 --> 11:57.205
Just think how much more we'll enjoy it
if we got all our unpacking done first.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.005
Oh, that can wait.

11:59.807 --> 12:02.116
By the way, Beth and I were talking,

12:02.287 --> 12:05.279
and I don't know what you guys
had in mind for tonight,

12:05.487 --> 12:07.079
and sorry if this sounds
kind of forward,

12:07.247 --> 12:09.886
but we would like to avoid an awkward,
uncomfortable situation

12:10.047 --> 12:12.481
by getting this out in the open
right now.

12:13.367 --> 12:16.404
When we go out to dinner tonight,
it's on us.

12:18.287 --> 12:19.276
Oh.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.723
- Well, that's, that's awfully nice of you.
- Very. Yes.

12:23.167 --> 12:27.638
Um, speaking of awkwardness...
Um, uh, you know...

12:27.807 --> 12:29.479
Look at that sunset.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.486
- Are you as crazed by this as I am?
- It's driving me out of my mind.

12:35.647 --> 12:37.877
All right then. We're gonna settle this
once and for all.

12:38.047 --> 12:39.685
Now, just follow my lead.

12:44.207 --> 12:47.279
Yes, that is lovely, isn't it?

He says I've got...

13:18.927 --> 13:21.566
Oh, what was that medical term
he used?

13:21.847 --> 13:24.645
Oh, I remember. Flu.

13:26.207 --> 13:29.199
God, I'm really sorry I didn't let you
get that flu shot.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.927
Is there anything at all
that I can do for you?

13:32.127 --> 13:34.960
Well, when I was a little girl
and got sick,

13:35.127 --> 13:37.277
Grammy Moon used to read me
to sleep.

13:37.447 --> 13:39.119
- It was a great comfort.
- Oh.

13:39.327 --> 13:41.158
- Is this what you're reading?
- Mm-hmm.

all that unpacking to do.

too many clothes this weekend.

one clear signal?

about our dating other people

I, I know that we're allowed
to see other people.

17:53.967 --> 17:58.199

are we allowed to see?

taken a lover herself,

of alleviating her guilt.
