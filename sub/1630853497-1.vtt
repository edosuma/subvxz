20:19.301 --> 20:20.428
We should talk later.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.305
These stairs is nice.
Bitch, I feel like we're plus one.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.808
LUKE: What's the address?
I wanna order thousands of 'em.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.892
How you doing?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.478
Bitch, you're on snacks. I'm on drinks.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.563
-Go.
-Okay.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.897
-A shot, please.
-I got this.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.649
-Let me just do it.
-I was a bartender.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.693
-You were a bar-back.
-LUKE: Semantics.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.071
NOAH: You wanna slow down.
It's like night one. Jesus.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.741
Excuse me, Dad.
Did you not hear Erin before?

20:41.824 --> 20:44.452
-We have to make the most of this night.
-Fair point.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.831
Oh, my God.
Bitch. Look at all of this cheese.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.916
Bring that here.
I can use that as a garnish.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.043
Guess you guys aren't bottoming tonight.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.839
LUKE: Actually, I'm one of the cleanest
ever, I've been told, bottom-wise.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.633
Can you cut limes right now?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.719
-KEEGAN: Cut limes?
-We can handle knives, right?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.053
KEEGAN: Yeah, why not?

21:03.137 --> 21:05.181
HOWIE: He starts, <i>Gays in Space.</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:08.142
And Jason Bateman
is surprisingly a good gay person.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.477
In like a very happy way.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.561
(LAUGHS)

21:10.644 --> 21:12.772
-You have to see it. It's like...
-Okay.

21:12.855 --> 21:15.983
-...really important.
-NOAH: Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

21:16.066 --> 21:19.779
I was just explaining this <i>SNL</i> sketch.
He's never seen <i>Gays in Space.</i>

21:19.862 --> 21:23.365
Honestly, the way you explained it,
I don't even wanna watch the sketch now.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.826
-You should probably watch the sketch.
-I refuse to.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.328
-Why are you being...
-Adamantly.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.915
Charlie. Have you seen Will?
I can't find him. He's hiding.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.125
Oh. Um...

21:33.793 --> 21:37.546
No, I haven't. But, uh... If you will
excuse me, I'll be right back.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.469
Cooper, have you heard of <i>Gays in Space?</i>

21:43.552 --> 21:45.554
-(CHUCKLING)
-COOPER: Is that like <i>Spaceballs?</i>

21:48.557 --> 21:51.769
Girl, please tell me you have not spent
the entire conversation

21:51.852 --> 21:53.729
walking him through old <i>SNL</i> sketches.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.358
Shut up. It's a classic.
But, no, it's been nice.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.778
He's a pediatrician,
isn't that so adorable?

22:00.861 --> 22:04.156
Sure. But is he a top or bottom,
does he eat ass, is he on PrEP?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.158
Have you gained no vital information?

22:06.242 --> 22:10.788
It's not like that.
I think he just likes talking to me.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.790
Then what the fuck are we doing here?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.501
These people are not our people.
I was talking to one of them.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.045
He thinks Lindsey Graham
was in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:19.171
Yikes.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.714
I gotta pee.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.640
Lindsey Graham in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>
I would watch that.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.942
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

22:44.738 --> 22:45.739
<i>Hmm.</i>

22:46.657 --> 22:48.826
<i>Let's see what Charlie's working with.</i>

22:48.909 --> 22:51.996
CHARLIE: He hasn't asked me for drugs.
It just feels special.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.748
And he is nothing like Rhys,
I will say that for him.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.710
WILL: Yeah, well, you just met him,
so it's kind of hard to know.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.671
CHARLIE: He hasn't asked me
what I'm into one time.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.298
It's so nice.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.885
WILL: Okay. I'm just saying
you've been single for what? A month?

23:05.968 --> 23:09.388
CHARLIE: Calm down.
I think that he's cute and funny.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.931
-WILL: Great.
-That's all I said.

23:11.015 --> 23:14.935
NOAH: <i>Translation.</i>
<i>He wants to dick my friend down.</i>

23:15.019 --> 23:17.438
-WILL: What about his friends?
-CHARLIE: They're nice.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.857
WILL: They're clearly using us
for free liquor.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.901
Have you seen the way they're drinking?

23:21.984 --> 23:25.738
CHARLIE: (CHUCKLES) Okay, yeah.
They're a little quirky, but, um...

23:26.530 --> 23:28.574
-What about Noah?
-WILL: He's fine.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.827
He's not hot enough
to be that annoying, though.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.955
CHARLIE: I'm so glad I invited you.
You're always so positive.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.332
WILL: Why am I here, Charlie?

23:36.415 --> 23:39.168
CHARLIE: Because Cooper's just
a family friend,

23:39.251 --> 23:41.378
and I wanted a real friend with me.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.671
Is that so bad?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.590
WILL:
I want you to be careful, that's all.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.801
You're a good person, and people
take advantage of that all the time.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.845
Especially the kind of people
that come here.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.180
CHARLIE: What does that mean?

23:51.263 --> 23:55.726
WILL: This place is a playground
for superficial, vapid morons.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.939
Will, promise me
you'll try to have a good time.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.400
Okay.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.329
-Everything has buckles on it now.
-Shade is good on him. It's his color.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.498
-We were just talking about you.
-Oh, I know.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.460
Yeah, they were wondering
where you got your Speedo from.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.046
It's so cute. Did you get it on Amazon?

24:24.129 --> 24:27.967
No, it's an heirloom.
It's been in my family for generations.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.344
-What?
-Mine's this little boutique brand.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.263
-You probably haven't heard of them.
-Is it Charlie?

24:33.347 --> 24:36.850
Because it says "Charlie"
in big, bold letters on your ass.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.436
-(CHUCKLES)
-I'm sorry, am I being annoying?

24:40.062 --> 24:42.940
-Yeah.
-(CHUCKLES) We have a problem.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.901
(LUKE AND KEEGAN SQUEALING)

24:47.569 --> 24:49.697
Are they bringing cheese
into the hot tub?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.699
So sorry.
We'll take them home right now.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.450
No, you stay. We got this, right?

24:53.534 --> 24:57.037
Absolutely. Thank you.
We had such a great time.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.373
Wonderful party. (CHUCKLES)

24:59.665 --> 25:02.334
(GASPS) Put that brie down!
No, not in the water!

25:02.418 --> 25:04.878
Hey, what is going on with you tonight?

25:05.796 --> 25:08.173
Listen. Do you like that guy?
Is he nice to you?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.176
Has he expressed
any interest in kinky sex?

25:11.260 --> 25:13.178
Yes. Yes. No.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.597
Then it doesn't matter
what's going on with me.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.682
You got this.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.394
But whatever you do,
do not let these people think

25:20.477 --> 25:23.063
they are better than us,
because at the end...

25:23.147 --> 25:24.273
-(RETCHES)
-(ALL GASP)

25:24.356 --> 25:25.649
KEEGAN: That is nasty.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.818
Damn, bitch.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.611
(RETCHING)

25:30.738 --> 25:34.033
ERIN: One of them stole this speaker.
I don't know where it goes.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.035
(SOFTLY) Disgusting.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.327
Never mind.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.329
KEEGAN: Girl, get that shit out.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.622
He's on PrEP.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.583
-You okay?
-LUKE: Oh, my God, no.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.626
-NOAH: Party's over, babe.
-KEEGAN: Come on.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.336
-LUKE: I threw up.
-NOAH: I told you.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.339
LUKE: I puked. Yes. Thank you.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.675
KEEGAN: Just think about
how skinny you will be, girl.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.136
You guys ever see <i>Gays in Space?</i>

25:54.219 --> 25:56.388
LUKE: They hate me now!

25:58.140 --> 25:59.349
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

26:05.355 --> 26:06.648
NOAH: <i>That's my girl.</i>

26:11.487 --> 26:13.447
Hey, did Howie make it home last night?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.240
No, if you can believe it.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.408
That little whore.

26:16.492 --> 26:20.370
Our little Howie with a doctor. It'll be
like having health insurance again.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.706
Okay, chill out.
It's just a one-night thing.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.334
Yeah, like, we don't even know
if anything happened.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.711
-Maybe they killed him.
-NOAH: Okay. Don't be bitter.

26:27.795 --> 26:31.673
-Did anybody bother to text him?
-MAX: I did. But it went to green.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.050
Maybe Keegan's right.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.011
Although, you are more likely
to get murdered in your own home.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.263
-LUKE: It's why I never host.
-Fuck. Uh...

26:38.972 --> 26:40.808
You know what? I bet his phone died.

26:40.891 --> 26:41.892
I'll go get him.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.321
Excuse me. Um, can we help you?

26:54.404 --> 26:56.198
Seriously, this again?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.783
Oh, my God. Howie?

26:58.325 --> 27:00.119
Oh, my God. Hi.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.455
See, Braden, I'm a friend.
Is Howie still here?

27:04.039 --> 27:06.166
He is, poor thing.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.627
I think he drank
a little too much last night.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.296
Top-shelf stuff
hits a little different than well.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.756
Can I go check on him?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.804
Last night, literally last night.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.684
(DOOR OPENS)

27:25.769 --> 27:26.770
Hey.

27:27.896 --> 27:28.981
You're back.

27:30.232 --> 27:33.068
Yep. Just came to check on my friend.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.988
-Uh, your friend's upstairs, I think.
-Great.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.322
Uh, wait.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.122
Here. He might need this.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.206
Thanks.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.377
I also just wanted to say sorry
about last night.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.838
Braden wasn't super welcoming. So...

27:52.921 --> 27:57.134
-Braden? You're apologizing for Braden?
-I don't understand.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.303
Little tip. The tap water here,
safe to drink.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.472
You don't have to pollute the oceans
or waste your money with bottles.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.433
-(BIN OPENS)
-(SCOFFS)

28:08.729 --> 28:09.730
You're right.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.607

28:13.692 --> 28:14.693
Noted.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.153
(SCOFFS)

28:16.320 --> 28:17.321
Nice.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.165
Look at you, superstar.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.333
(HOWIE GROANS)

28:29.708 --> 28:32.544
I want to die.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.714
What happened? I haven't seen you
like this since your Four Loko days.

28:35.797 --> 28:39.676
I think it's the expensive booze.
Guess my body is used to well.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.221
Where are people getting this?
That's not science.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.806
(GROANS) I'm humiliated.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.350
Oh, no.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.728
I take it you didn't make it happen
with the doctor last night?

28:49.811 --> 28:53.148
No. I spent most of the night in here.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.652
But he did stay up with me, though.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.820
Well, that's good.
It means he's into you.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.823
But it is day two. I think we should
start looking into other options.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.535
Yeah. Totally. I'm sure
there's tons of cute guys on this island

29:05.619 --> 29:08.830
who would miss a party to watch me puke.

29:08.914 --> 29:12.251
Well, he is a doctor,
so he sort of has to.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.878
Right.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.839
He did this thing, though,

29:19.591 --> 29:22.469
where he was rubbing my back
while I was sick,

29:22.552 --> 29:25.138
and I don't know how to explain it,

29:26.765 --> 29:29.101
but it felt really intimate.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.020
I don't know. I'm being stupid.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.273
No, you're not being stupid.
It's just...

29:34.356 --> 29:36.817
Don't get sucked into one guy's orbit.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.901
Right.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.028
CHARLIE: Knock, knock.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.823
Hi. Sorry.
Will told me you were up here.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.783
I just came to check on our patient.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.786
Well, he's pregnant
and he's not raising this baby alone.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.079
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

29:49.246 --> 29:50.580
HOWIE: I'm fine.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.583
Thank you again for everything.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.504
Of course. Don't mention it.
Honestly, my back feels incredible.

29:57.587 --> 30:01.091
I might just start sleeping
on the bathroom floor every night.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.808
Charlie, do you wanna come
and eat dinner at our house tonight?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.310
As, like, a thank you.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.729
You don't have to do that.

30:13.812 --> 30:18.191
NOAH: Oh, please. You took such
good care of Howie, let us repay you.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.694
Uh, can I invite the rest of my house?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.821
That could be fun, right?

30:24.948 --> 30:26.033
NOAH: Sure.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.368
The more the merrier.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.830
ERIN: Why did you spring
a dinner on me like this?

30:31.913 --> 30:33.373
You love throwing dinner parties.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.751
It makes it really stressful
to be friends with you.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.420
For you, I could put out
a platter of uncooked hotdogs

30:38.503 --> 30:40.130
and you kids would eat it right up.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.049
-We wouldn't.
-We can cancel if you want.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.592
I would rather die.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.635
Go to the Pantry. I'll text you a list.

30:45.719 --> 30:50.015
Find anything dented, label-less
or on the brink of expiration.

-All right.

-Let's go.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.939
Guys, if you wanna keep those jocks
white, I would move. Get out of the way.

53:12.022 --> 53:15.484
-Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
-I'm a little busy right now.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.528
-Okay. Just be careful.
-NOAH: What?

53:17.611 --> 53:19.029
Dex is not a good guy.

53:19.113 --> 53:21.281
-Why, because he has an OnlyFans?
-What? No.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.575
He doesn't have great things
to say about you either.

53:23.659 --> 53:26.954
Did I see you two naughty boys
come out of the dark room together?

53:27.037 --> 53:28.080
NOAH: <i>Perfect.</i>

53:28.163 --> 53:30.582
It's so weird, Will,
because he was just saying tonight

53:30.666 --> 53:32.543
how he wasn't into you at all and now...

53:32.626 --> 53:35.337
I didn't say that.
I'm not, for the record, but...

53:35.421 --> 53:36.588
Do my eyes look crazy?

53:37.214 --> 53:39.466
My eyes look crazy.
They're completely black.

53:39.550 --> 53:42.177
No. They're fine...
Actually, they are kind of weird.

-NOAH: What?

53:54.982 --> 53:57.359

53:57.568 --> 53:59.278

53:59.361 --> 54:01.155
COOPER: That's Charlie's ex, Rhys.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.866
We just flew him out this morning.

54:03.949 --> 54:06.827
Well, I guess not "ex" anymore.

54:06.910 --> 54:09.621
Yeah, Dex is the one
I gotta watch out for.

54:09.705 --> 54:11.123
I gotta find Howie.

-Come on.

54:17.671 --> 54:20.424
Um, you're gonna take this
into the bathroom, fill it up,

54:20.507 --> 54:22.843
and drink until you feel normal. Okay?

54:22.926 --> 54:24.094
I am fine.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.513
And smart.

54:27.264 --> 54:28.265

Ah.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.948

So, did you ever find Charlie?

54:56.376 --> 54:58.003
-You saw him with that...
-Oh, yeah.

54:58.086 --> 55:01.340
That fucking Zac Efron-looking guy
he's dry humping?

55:01.423 --> 55:04.802
No, good for him. I love <i>Neighbors 2.</i>

55:04.885 --> 55:07.971
It's the rare sequel
that surpasses the original.

55:08.806 --> 55:09.848
Are you okay?

55:09.932 --> 55:12.559
I mean, you saw the guy. It's game over.

55:12.643 --> 55:14.436
No. The night is young. You...

55:14.520 --> 55:18.816
-Yeah, I can fuck anybody I want.
-Oh.

55:19.191 --> 55:23.904

-No, the ground is the new chair, baby!

55:24.530 --> 55:26.156
Oh, fuck Charlie.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.034

to someone in my league.

55:29.117 --> 55:30.869
-No, that's not...
-Girl.

55:30.953 --> 55:33.330

56:12.870 --> 56:13.871
Hey.

56:16.081 --> 56:19.126
If you're looking for your friends,
they just got on a water taxi.

56:19.209 --> 56:23.463
What? Those bitches.
I'm the one without a phone.

56:23.547 --> 56:26.550
I think it was the last taxi out
and they panicked.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.510
I told them I'd come find you.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.555
I know where they're going,

56:31.638 --> 56:34.308
we'd just have to
cut through the Meat Rack.

You coming or what?

56:46.028 --> 56:48.447
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck!

56:49.323 --> 56:52.951
For somebody who reads so much,
you have a very narrow vocabulary.

56:53.035 --> 56:54.411
You're really boring, you know?

56:54.494 --> 56:56.371
Because I don't speak like
a 13-year-old?

56:56.455 --> 56:59.374
No. Because you're rude,
elitist, smug, hella judgmental...

56:59.458 --> 57:01.585
You seem to have
a lot of opinions about someone

57:01.668 --> 57:03.253
you've only known for three days.

57:03.337 --> 57:06.673
That's funny. You had a lot of opinions
about me after what? Three hours?

57:06.757 --> 57:09.092
-What're You talking about?
-God, how did you put it?

57:09.176 --> 57:11.511
"He's not hot enough
to be that annoying"?

57:11.595 --> 57:13.013
Did Charlie tell you I said that?

57:13.096 --> 57:14.640
That's what you're concerned about?

57:14.723 --> 57:17.601
-No, I'm sorry, I just...
-No, Charlie didn't tell me.

57:17.684 --> 57:18.810
Are you happy?

57:18.894 --> 57:20.437
God, say what you will about me,

57:20.520 --> 57:23.106
but you barely even met Howie
before you and your crew

57:23.190 --> 57:25.150
decided he wasn't good enough
for Charlie.

57:25.233 --> 57:28.654
And then to pull this shit. Literally
airdropping in his ex from Manhattan.

57:28.737 --> 57:29.780
That's psychotic.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.741
I didn't have anything to do with Rhys
coming here. That was Cooper.

57:32.824 --> 57:35.702
I can't stand Rhys.
For the record, I like your friend.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.829
Anything I did,
I was doing to protect Charlie.

57:37.913 --> 57:41.458
Protect Charlie? From who? From Howie?

57:41.541 --> 57:45.128
Have you met him? I should've been
protecting him from all of you people.

57:45.212 --> 57:48.006
"You people"? What do I have in common
with any of them?

57:48.090 --> 57:51.259
I've never met somebody
who made it so clear, so immediately,

57:51.343 --> 57:53.762
that they think they're so superior
than everybody else.

57:53.845 --> 57:55.847
First I thought
it was because you were rich,

57:55.931 --> 57:57.599
but it's actually deeper than that.

57:57.683 --> 58:00.811
You think if you let everybody know
how miserable you are being gay,

58:00.894 --> 58:02.729
it'll make you less of a faggot than us.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.272
I don't think I'm better than you.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.233
-You don't have to, everybody else does.
-Who?

58:06.316 --> 58:09.277
The whole fucking world.
Dude, look at us.

58:09.361 --> 58:11.905
Okay, you're this big,
rich, successful lawyer

58:11.989 --> 58:14.032

And I'm not.

58:14.116 --> 58:15.659
You are spectacular.

58:15.742 --> 58:18.245
You think you've got
the whole world figured out,

58:18.328 --> 58:20.747
but all you're doing
is assuming the worst.

58:20.831 --> 58:23.667
Makes it easier for you.
You expect everyone to reject you,

58:23.750 --> 58:25.836
so when somebody
comes along and actually does,

58:25.919 --> 58:27.421
it doesn't hurt so much.

58:29.381 --> 58:31.174
The reality is, Noah,

58:32.884 --> 58:34.845
no one's thinking that much about you.

what you think about me.

1:04:37.374 --> 1:04:38.541
We have a situation.

1:04:39.250 --> 1:04:40.835
What the fuck is he doing here?

1:04:40.919 --> 1:04:43.088
He showed up
saying he needed to talk to Howie.

1:04:43.171 --> 1:04:46.091
They're in the one place
that's impossible to eavesdrop on.

1:04:46.174 --> 1:04:49.219
-NOAH: (SIGHS) When did Howie get back?
-A little while ago.

1:04:49.302 --> 1:04:51.346
Did something happen between you two?

1:04:51.429 --> 1:04:55.016
I don't know. I think he...
I think he blames me for that.

1:04:55.100 --> 1:04:58.311
But I told him from the start,
don't get sucked into one guy's orbit.

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:00.230
Especially that guy.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:04.234
And I've been focused all week on him
and his happiness and getting him laid.

1:05:04.317 --> 1:05:06.861
And I didn't think
it would solve all his problems,

1:05:06.945 --> 1:05:09.781
but I thought I could make him feel hot
and powerful for a week.

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:11.950
Is sex what makes you feel
hot and powerful?

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:14.077
No. I'm hot and powerful,
so I have a lot of sex.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:16.955
I just thought I could
reverse-engineer it a little bit.

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:20.834
But... I think I can still fix this.
I just...

1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:24.129
(SIGHS) I don't know. It's complicated.

1:05:24.212 --> 1:05:26.339
"Complicated"? Please.
Wanna know what I think...

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:29.551
Babe, I love you,
but this is me and Howie. It's serious.

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:31.928
Oh. Fuck you. Listen.

1:05:32.011 --> 1:05:34.764
I know you all think I'm some old,
ridiculous burnout,

1:05:34.848 --> 1:05:39.227
but I had a whole life before I met you,
and it used to look a lot like yours.

1:05:39.310 --> 1:05:41.438
I had lovers, and friends,

1:05:41.521 --> 1:05:44.023
summers in Cherry Grove
with lesbians my own age.

1:05:44.107 --> 1:05:47.694
-And I thought I had it all figured out.
-Babe, I know all your stories.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:50.864
Yes, the fun ones.
Not the ones where I fucked it up.

1:05:50.947 --> 1:05:54.325
I tried to fix everyone,
but what I was doing is, over time,

1:05:54.409 --> 1:05:56.911
slowly pushing
everyone I cared about out of my life.

1:05:56.995 --> 1:06:00.248
Until my only friends
were a group of boys half my age

1:06:00.331 --> 1:06:03.001
who only put up with me
because I have a house on Fire Island.

1:06:03.084 --> 1:06:04.627
That's not true. We love you.

1:06:04.711 --> 1:06:07.797
That's sweet.
But you're missing the point.

1:06:07.881 --> 1:06:10.175
Howie doesn't need anyone to fix him.

1:06:10.258 --> 1:06:13.261
Not you, not this island, not anything.

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:16.139
He just needs a friend.

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:18.057
He'll be just fine. You'll see.

1:06:23.188 --> 1:06:24.898
Oh, my God! My baby's drowning!

1:06:30.195 --> 1:06:34.240

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:36.075

-ERIN: Please.

Yolanda Hadid has?

1:06:39.204 --> 1:06:44.083
Yeah, he just found out.
And, now, Charlie, you know...

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:49.339
Wants to be supportive
because he says it's really serious.

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:51.549
NOAH: Oh, my God.
That's clearly bullshit.

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:53.092
You saw that guy last night. He...

1:06:53.176 --> 1:06:55.970
Yeah, Charlie probably
made it up because he feels bad.

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:59.849
-No, that's not what I was gonna say.
-What difference does it make?

-Hey, weirdo.

1:07:58.074 --> 1:07:59.993
You dropped your ice cream back there.

1:08:00.702 --> 1:08:01.703
Oh.

1:08:02.370 --> 1:08:03.955
I wasn't sure you'd want to see me.

1:08:04.038 --> 1:08:06.165
So you ran away?

1:08:07.709 --> 1:08:08.668

1:08:09.335 --> 1:08:10.461
I got your letter.

1:08:12.213 --> 1:08:13.256

1:08:14.007 --> 1:08:15.842
-So are we...
-Good?

1:08:17.176 --> 1:08:18.219
We're good.

1:08:18.886 --> 1:08:22.557
I am, however, a little pissed
at your friend right now. Lyme disease?

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:24.475
You kidding me?
Does he even like that guy?

1:08:24.559 --> 1:08:27.854
I don't know. Can we...
Can we talk about something else?

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:30.523
Sure. Let's talk about Dex.

1:08:30.607 --> 1:08:33.568
You send me this weird letter
like a Victorian ghost,

1:08:33.651 --> 1:08:36.321
filled with all these vague details
about the past.

1:08:36.404 --> 1:08:38.156
It's not really my story to tell.

1:08:38.406 --> 1:08:41.159
But look at this,
and it'll give you a clearer picture

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:43.453
of the kind of person he really is.

1:08:43.536 --> 1:08:45.413
He has an Instagram. What a villain.

1:08:46.414 --> 1:08:48.791
Okay. So he has some thotty pictures.

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:51.878
But it doesn't make him
a bad guy necessarily.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:54.380
-Oh.
-Just be careful.

1:08:55.423 --> 1:08:56.883
You have to trust me.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:58.676

Something like that.

1:09:01.971 --> 1:09:04.140
-I'm not an easy guy to be friends with.
-Shocking.

1:09:04.223 --> 1:09:05.808

then sent it to Jonathan!

1:15:57.178 --> 1:16:00.056
Probably half the cater-waiters
on the Lower East Side have seen it.

1:16:00.139 --> 1:16:02.475
There's not much to do
between courses besides jerk off.

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:04.435
This is bad, that's my whole face.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:07.188
Did he tell you he was gonna do that?
If it was okay?

1:16:07.271 --> 1:16:08.355
What do you think?

1:16:08.439 --> 1:16:10.274
I don't know. I don't remember.

1:16:10.357 --> 1:16:13.235
I was so fucked up
I barely remember having sex with him.

1:16:13.319 --> 1:16:14.320
This is not cool.

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:16.947
But I remember I woke up
in the morning and he was there.

1:16:17.031 --> 1:16:19.200
And we spent
the whole day mostly fucking,

1:16:19.283 --> 1:16:21.202
which I definitely consented to that.

1:16:21.285 --> 1:16:24.330
And I thought the whole thing
was kind of romantic until right now.

1:16:24.413 --> 1:16:26.248
-NOAH: Give me that.
-What are you gonna do?

1:16:26.332 --> 1:16:28.834
Please don't do anything insane.
Just have him take it down.

1:16:28.918 --> 1:16:31.754
I don't want him mad at me,
so don't be all Noah about it.

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:33.047
NOAH: <i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:34.131
Sure.

1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:38.094
-Luke, I'm so sor...
-What the fuck! That is so fucked up!

1:16:38.719 --> 1:16:40.471
You'll be happy to know you were right.

1:16:40.554 --> 1:16:42.598
I'm gonna be honest.
This feels like a trap.

1:16:45.226 --> 1:16:47.561
-Why am I looking at pornography?
-Look closer.

1:16:49.897 --> 1:16:53.776
-I'm gonna kill him.
-No, wait. I said that. That's my thing.

1:16:56.779 --> 1:16:58.697
-Hey, what's up?
-Fucking little shit!

1:17:02.827 --> 1:17:04.870
-What the fuck?
-Look familiar?

1:17:04.954 --> 1:17:05.955
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1:17:06.038 --> 1:17:08.791
Okay. I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding, okay?

1:17:08.874 --> 1:17:10.042
You don't get to be dry.

1:17:10.126 --> 1:17:13.045
If you're pissed because
I fucked your friend instead of you,

1:17:13.129 --> 1:17:14.839
-the least you could've...
-Nice try.

1:17:14.922 --> 1:17:18.300
I'm pissed because you're a loser and
a fraud who takes advantage of people.

1:17:18.384 --> 1:17:20.302
He was willing.
More than I can say for you.

1:17:20.386 --> 1:17:22.680
He didn't know
you'd put this online! That's...

1:17:22.763 --> 1:17:23.764
WILL: A crime.

1:17:25.182 --> 1:17:27.685
Without some sort of
written waiver of consent,

1:17:27.768 --> 1:17:31.105
this meets the criteria under
New York state law for revenge porn.

1:17:32.189 --> 1:17:36.402
Add in the illegal substances involved
and you're looking at jail time,

1:17:36.485 --> 1:17:39.613
a hefty fine,
and registration as a sex offender.

1:17:39.697 --> 1:17:42.116
-Hold on. We do not have...
-Speaking with the victim,

1:17:42.199 --> 1:17:44.535
I think we can resolve
this matter right now.

1:17:46.912 --> 1:17:47.913
How?

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:51.709
WILL: Delete the video on your phone
and your website for starters.

1:17:51.792 --> 1:17:52.877
Now.

1:17:54.295 --> 1:17:56.046
WILL: I would make it
my personal mission

1:17:56.130 --> 1:17:59.133
to make sure
these videos disappear forever.

1:17:59.216 --> 1:18:01.093
And you have to delete your Instagram.

1:18:01.177 --> 1:18:03.971
-What? No way!
-I don't think we can make him do that.

1:18:04.054 --> 1:18:06.390
If a judge saw the Instagram,
they'd be on my side.

1:18:07.474 --> 1:18:08.851
Fuck, just check his phone.

1:18:14.273 --> 1:18:15.816
Awesome. We're done here.

1:18:19.278 --> 1:18:22.448
-Those are waterproof now, you know.
-Don't ruin this for me.

1:18:23.073 --> 1:18:25.201
NOAH: Shut the fuck up!
You made that up?

1:18:25.284 --> 1:18:30.247
Some of it. Some of it was
a little bit of an exaggeration.

1:18:30.331 --> 1:18:32.333
Holy shit! You <i>Legally Blonde'd</i> him.

1:18:32.416 --> 1:18:34.710
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry, I don't know what that is.

1:18:35.878 --> 1:18:37.046
You don't know what...

1:18:37.129 --> 1:18:40.841
Oh, my God! We were having such a nice
moment, and you had to ruin it.

1:18:40.925 --> 1:18:41.926
(CHUCKLES)

1:18:42.009 --> 1:18:45.137
Is that what you do in L. A.?
Big trial lawyer like the...

1:18:45.221 --> 1:18:47.514
No, I work for a nonprofit.

1:18:48.599 --> 1:18:51.810
Mostly tenants' rights stuff,
wrongful evictions.

1:18:51.894 --> 1:18:53.103
Nothing sexy.

1:18:54.563 --> 1:18:55.606
Yeah. Sure.

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:58.692
I'm just happy
that I could help, you know?

1:18:59.777 --> 1:19:00.819
Dex, he...

1:19:02.112 --> 1:19:06.367
He's never really been concerned
about enthusiastic consent.

1:19:06.450 --> 1:19:09.286
Just... I couldn't do much last time.

1:19:09.370 --> 1:19:11.080
My friend, he was embarrassed, I think,

1:19:11.163 --> 1:19:13.457
and didn't want us to talk about it,
so we didn't.

1:19:13.540 --> 1:19:15.334
And Dex got to keep his image.

1:19:15.793 --> 1:19:18.462
Yeah, well,
people will talk about it now.

1:19:18.963 --> 1:19:20.339
I've got a real big mouth.

1:19:20.422 --> 1:19:23.175
I don't know how things work in L. A.,
but in New York,

1:19:23.259 --> 1:19:24.927
we've ostracized people for way less.

1:19:25.636 --> 1:19:27.096
That's something, at least.

1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:31.183
Hey, um...

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:34.687
Seriously, thank you. I owe you one.

1:19:40.109 --> 1:19:41.819
<i>Time on Fire Island...</i>

1:19:46.782 --> 1:19:49.535
<i>Sometimes it feels</i>
<i>like it stretches on forever.</i>

1:19:56.333 --> 1:19:57.418
LUKE: Hey!

1:19:58.168 --> 1:19:59.253
So, what happened?

1:20:00.170 --> 1:20:01.338
I'll be up in a minute.

1:20:02.089 --> 1:20:03.090
LUKE: Come on.

1:20:06.677 --> 1:20:07.928
Sure you don't wanna come up?

1:20:08.012 --> 1:20:11.432
Yeah, no,
I'm not very good at parties. So...

1:20:11.515 --> 1:20:14.268
-What? You're not good at parties?
-Uh...

1:20:14.768 --> 1:20:16.937
-Not Will! No.
-All right.

1:20:17.021 --> 1:20:19.732
-Not good at parties? What?
-Calm down. (CHUCKLES)

1:20:31.618 --> 1:20:33.162
So I pushed him in the pool,

1:20:33.245 --> 1:20:35.331
and he looked up at me
and said, "I love you."

1:20:35.414 --> 1:20:37.666
And I said,
"You don't know what love is."

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:39.460
And then I realized, "You're ugly."

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:41.754
Can't believe
you're letting him tell your story.

1:20:41.837 --> 1:20:45.299
Yeah, I think this is just
his way of processing things.

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:47.968
Where did Will go?

1:20:48.427 --> 1:20:49.553
Why would I know that?

1:20:49.636 --> 1:20:52.306
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to worry about me.

1:20:52.389 --> 1:20:54.183
You can fuck whoever you want.

1:20:54.266 --> 1:20:57.311
Okay, that is definitely
not what I am looking for.

1:20:57.394 --> 1:21:00.147
And by the way,
I'm not done worrying about you.

1:21:00.230 --> 1:21:02.858
If I hadn't pushed you,
literally pushed you, then...

1:21:02.941 --> 1:21:05.736
I told you,
I'm fine with the Charlie of it all.

1:21:05.819 --> 1:21:08.280
-And honestly...
-Are you talking about me?

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:10.824
No. We're talking
about our other friend Charlie.

1:21:11.492 --> 1:21:13.452
He died in a fire.

1:21:13.535 --> 1:21:14.912
It's really sad.

1:21:15.162 --> 1:21:17.039
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1:21:17.289 --> 1:21:19.541
-Ignore him. Did you have fun?
-(CHUCKLES)

1:21:19.708 --> 1:21:22.586
I did. Yes.
We don't usually go to karaoke.

1:21:22.753 --> 1:21:27.633
Just the parties. So, I was glad
that you showed it to me before Rhys...

1:21:27.716 --> 1:21:31.095
Choo-choo, where's my vodka soda?
Baby's thirsty.

1:21:31.762 --> 1:21:32.763
Uh...

1:21:32.846 --> 1:21:36.975
Sorry, you guys don't know each other.
Rhys, this is Howie and Noah.

1:21:37.059 --> 1:21:40.270
Oh, my God, cute. Boyfriend twins!
It's like looking in a mirror.

1:21:40.354 --> 1:21:42.189
CHARLIE: Sweetie,
they're not boyfriends.

1:21:42.272 --> 1:21:43.941
Come on, let's go in and dance.

1:21:44.024 --> 1:21:45.984
(WHISPERING) I'm horny, okay?

1:21:46.777 --> 1:21:48.195
CHARLIE: I'll see you guys later?

1:21:48.695 --> 1:21:50.280
-COOPER: Later, hons.
-CHARLIE: Bye.

1:21:50.364 --> 1:21:53.867
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and scrub my eyeballs out.

1:21:53.951 --> 1:21:55.702
Yeah, probably a good plan. Hey.

1:21:57.037 --> 1:21:59.373
(BOTH MOUTHING)

1:22:01.875 --> 1:22:03.669
You know what?
Actually, let's do it later.

1:22:03.752 --> 1:22:04.878
No. We're doing it now.

1:22:07.423 --> 1:22:08.590
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:22:08.966 --> 1:22:11.093
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hey. Um...

1:22:11.385 --> 1:22:12.428
How are you doing?

1:22:13.137 --> 1:22:15.681
Look, you did not have to do that
for me before.

1:22:16.557 --> 1:22:17.641
Especially for me,

1:22:17.724 --> 1:22:19.560
'cause I'm such a bitch
to you all the time.

1:22:19.643 --> 1:22:22.104
I know we're friends,
but things are obviously different...

1:22:22.187 --> 1:22:25.357
It's not even that we're friends, Luke.
We're more than that.

1:22:25.441 --> 1:22:29.736
We're family, right?
Like, that means something to me.

1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:31.321
Because you two and...

1:22:31.405 --> 1:22:34.741
All you guys, you're, like, all I have.

1:22:38.871 --> 1:22:42.124
Whatever. Are we gonna hug
and wrap this up? How does this end?

1:22:42.207 --> 1:22:44.084
Why don't we get fucked up and dance?

1:22:44.918 --> 1:22:46.712
Come on. You're gonna be okay.

1:22:46.795 --> 1:22:48.213
LUKE: Oh, I am?

1:22:48.297 --> 1:22:49.756
-Are we gonna hug?
-NOAH: No.

1:22:52.634 --> 1:22:53.635
(GRUNTS)

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:01.852
What are you doing?

1:23:04.021 --> 1:23:05.022
Don't be mad.

1:23:06.482 --> 1:23:07.816
Howard.

1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:11.528
I can't do it.
I can't stay and see him...

1:23:12.654 --> 1:23:14.740
Or see them together like that.

1:23:14.823 --> 1:23:17.367
Oh, my God. You cannot end
your vacation because of one guy.

1:23:17.451 --> 1:23:21.663
It's not just about Charlie.
It's a lifetime of Charlies.

1:23:23.207 --> 1:23:26.668
I'm 30 and I've never had a boyfriend.
I've never been in a relationship.

1:23:26.752 --> 1:23:28.462
-I've never...
-We've been through this.

1:23:28.545 --> 1:23:31.340
Monogamy was created by straight people
to make us less interesting.

1:23:31.423 --> 1:23:35.427
Yeah, I've heard your TED talk.
Listen. Please.

1:23:38.305 --> 1:23:39.306
Okay.

1:23:45.812 --> 1:23:47.397
You're the only person I know

1:23:48.357 --> 1:23:51.360
who understands
how shitty it can be sometimes

1:23:52.486 --> 1:23:55.822
to feel unwanted like this.

1:23:57.407 --> 1:23:59.993
And I'm so glad
that you've found a way to feel good

1:24:00.077 --> 1:24:03.247
despite all the fucked-up shit
we deal with.

1:24:03.705 --> 1:24:07.960
But you think that if you're vulnerable
for just one second,

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:10.254
that it's all gonna come crashing down.

1:24:10.337 --> 1:24:15.425
And maybe that's true for you,
but it's not true for me.

1:24:16.969 --> 1:24:18.595
I want to be vulnerable.

1:24:19.638 --> 1:24:21.348
Even if it hurts.

1:24:23.559 --> 1:24:26.520
Your rules, they don't work for me.

1:24:27.813 --> 1:24:31.483
And honestly, I don't know
that they're working for you either.

1:24:33.694 --> 1:24:35.696
So let me be sad about this,

1:24:36.738 --> 1:24:40.826
and deal with it
and figure it out my own way.

1:24:46.248 --> 1:24:48.959
Yeah, but my way you get to cum a bunch.

1:24:49.042 --> 1:24:52.087
Oh, my God, I'm gonna masturbate
so much when I get home.

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:55.674
What the fuck... (SIGHS)

1:24:56.133 --> 1:24:57.259
When are you leaving?

1:24:57.926 --> 1:24:59.011
Five o'clock ferry.

1:24:59.094 --> 1:25:02.097
Oh, my God, you couldn't even stay
for one last sunset?

1:25:02.639 --> 1:25:05.350
This is the last time
we're gonna be in our home together.

1:25:05.434 --> 1:25:08.061
Our friendship isn't just
limited to this island.

1:25:08.604 --> 1:25:11.106
You know,
you've never come to visit me in S. F.

1:25:11.189 --> 1:25:13.108
I'm not flying Spirit for you, bitch.

1:25:13.191 --> 1:25:14.192
(SCOFFS)

1:25:15.277 --> 1:25:16.278
(SNIFFLES)

1:25:18.113 --> 1:25:19.823
-Does Charlie know?
-No.

1:25:19.906 --> 1:25:22.159
Probably give me
another pity conversation.

1:25:22.242 --> 1:25:25.662
And at this point, it would
make me feel even more pathetic.

1:25:25.746 --> 1:25:27.039
Or he could,

1:25:28.081 --> 1:25:30.667
you know, do one of those
pre-9/11 rom-com moves,

1:25:30.751 --> 1:25:33.420
you know, where somebody
rushes through an airport

1:25:33.503 --> 1:25:35.255
and stops you from getting on the plane.

1:25:35.339 --> 1:25:38.759
And then, you kiss and it's awesome.

1:25:38.967 --> 1:25:41.637
I thought you didn't want
the rom-com bullshit for me.

1:25:42.095 --> 1:25:45.223
Babe, all I want is for you to be happy.

1:25:46.058 --> 1:25:47.100
Always.

1:25:50.103 --> 1:25:52.481
Promise me you won't tell Charlie.

1:25:54.191 --> 1:25:55.192
I promise.

1:25:56.151 --> 1:25:57.152
Charlie!

1:25:57.235 --> 1:25:59.029
<i>I mean, you had to</i>
<i>see that coming, right?</i>

1:25:59.112 --> 1:26:00.781
-Can we help you?
-Help me? Yeah.

1:26:00.864 --> 1:26:03.033
You could get a new
fucking line, Braden. Jesus.

1:26:03.241 --> 1:26:05.118
Wait, he's leaving? Why?

1:26:05.202 --> 1:26:06.411
Do you need a hint?

1:26:06.495 --> 1:26:09.956
Okay. Fair. Um, look, the timing of this
is just really shitty.

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.542
-Fuck the timing. Go and stop him.
-It's not that simple.

1:26:12.626 --> 1:26:15.337
I've known Rhys
since before I came out, and I owe him.

Listen, I get it. I get your whole
nice guy schtick, all right?

1:26:19.257 --> 1:26:22.469
But you have the chance
at something real with Howie.

1:26:22.552 --> 1:26:24.888
Something great. I don't really get it.

1:26:24.971 --> 1:26:27.224
But what the fuck do I know?
I've been wrong before.

1:26:27.307 --> 1:26:28.558
I've been wrong a lot.

1:26:29.017 --> 1:26:33.480
This week, especially,
about people and situations and...

1:26:36.566 --> 1:26:39.820
Stuff, okay?
Maybe I was even wrong about you.

1:26:39.903 --> 1:26:42.155
Maybe you're not the idiot
that I thought you were.

1:26:42.239 --> 1:26:43.740
Prove me wrong. Go and do something,

1:26:43.824 --> 1:26:46.118

it's game over.

likes that little Asian guy?

1:26:56.461 --> 1:26:58.797
-Rhys.
-I mean, come on. He's joking, right?

-You're the Amy Schumer one?
-Enough.

-RHYS: But...
-CHARLIE: I said, enough.

1:27:02.342 --> 1:27:05.220

-Yeah, I think I get the gist.

1:27:06.430 --> 1:27:08.432
-Noah, I'm sorry.
-You know what's funny?

1:27:08.515 --> 1:27:10.058
I am the only person this week

1:27:10.142 --> 1:27:12.561
who stopped to consider
whether you deserved him.

1:27:14.312 --> 1:27:15.939
You were right about this place.

1:27:20.777 --> 1:27:23.113

1:27:30.454 --> 1:27:32.038
It's just not right.

-HOWIE: You'll barely notice I'm gone.
-Not true.

1:27:37.419 --> 1:27:40.046
Probably taking one of Max's
little walks in the Meat Rack.

1:27:40.130 --> 1:27:42.799
For your information,
I'm looking at constellations.

1:27:42.883 --> 1:27:44.384
Oh, sweetie, give it a rest.

your ass ate in the dunes.

Are you sure this is how you wanna go?

1:27:56.313 --> 1:27:57.397
Yeah. I am.

1:28:01.568 --> 1:28:02.986

all the wrong stuff is changing.

1:29:13.974 --> 1:29:14.975
So, what's our plan?

1:29:15.058 --> 1:29:18.270
To sort of stand here sadly
in the direct sun all day, or...

1:29:18.353 --> 1:29:20.105
You couldn't even give us a minute.

1:29:20.188 --> 1:29:23.233
I know Howie. He would not want us
to sit here and mope on the dock.

1:29:23.316 --> 1:29:25.819
He would want us
to do bumps of K by the pool.

1:29:25.902 --> 1:29:27.237
-So let's go.
-Fuck!

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:29.364
Did he get on? Did I miss him?

1:29:29.447 --> 1:29:32.117
-What the fuck are you doing here? Hi.
-Hey.

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:34.828
-I thought I could stop him.
-You fucked that one up, buddy.

1:29:34.911 --> 1:29:38.790
-He's halfway to the mainland by now.
-So what should I do? Should I call him?

1:29:38.874 --> 1:29:41.960
If you wanted to fix this,
you'd have to do something really big,
