WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:04.210
I'm Cat Chambers.
It's been five years
since I left the Reef.

00:04.210 --> 00:05.540
 And you're
the hot local detective,

00:05.540 --> 00:07.120
and I'm supposed to
figure

00:07.120 --> 00:09.080
you're safe
for a one-night stand.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.580
In my old life, I
was a professional-
surfer-turned-thief

00:11.580 --> 00:13.750
with a soon-to-be ex-husband
who is FBI.

00:13.750 --> 00:14.960
I need your help.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.500
The last time you said that,
killed my career.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.120
Uh, no, marrying me
while you were undercover

00:18.120 --> 00:19.540
killed your career.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.670
But now I'm back...
There's a boathouse.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.170
If you ever need a place
to stay, it's yours.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.830
...and it looks like
I may stay awhile.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.120
Would like to put you
on a retainer.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.380
Some problems,
you need a --

00:27.380 --> 00:28.670
A fixer?

00:28.670 --> 00:29.920
Works for me.

00:34.170 --> 00:35.710
Now, you listen to me.

00:35.710 --> 00:38.080
After today, there is no deal.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.460
A 90-year-old woman
with Coke-bottle cataracts

00:40.460 --> 00:42.330
could ID your boss
in this video.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.960
The price is $3 million,
my Cayman account,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.080
end of business today.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.880
Do I sound like I'm negotiating?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.710 --> 01:26.040
Can't believe you conned
Carter Eastland

01:26.040 --> 01:27.290
out of his daughter's
beach house.

01:27.290 --> 01:29.080
I'm a very good con woman.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.830
Maybe we should stop
doing this.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.620
And why would we
do that?

01:37.620 --> 01:39.040
I'm a cop.
You're a --

01:39.040 --> 01:40.670
What, a thief?
Criminal?

01:42.620 --> 01:44.670
Well, last I recall,
when we hooked up,

01:44.670 --> 01:46.210
you ditched me
to go surfing.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.120
Uh, well, lucky for you,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.290
today...

01:51.290 --> 01:53.420
is spring tides.

01:53.420 --> 01:58.620
Wind swells less than
10...seconds...apart.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.210
Mm.
-Mm.

02:00.210 --> 02:01.830
I don't know
what that means.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.500
That means...

02:03.500 --> 02:06.170
no surfing.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.710
Mm.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.169
Give me 15 minutes.

02:16.210 --> 02:19.170
Well, if it isn't
FBI Agent Jake Elliot.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.330
No, we are not serving
any liquor

02:21.330 --> 02:23.620
in this establishment
on a Sunday morning.

02:23.620 --> 02:25.210
You think I'm wearing
a wire?

02:25.210 --> 02:27.210
Would be fun to see you
making cases again.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.330
Not today.

02:30.330 --> 02:31.620
No beer on Sunday?

02:31.620 --> 02:33.880
I'm busy today, Red.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.210
You sell dog treats?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.580
Aisle 4.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.420
You bought a puppy...

02:45.420 --> 02:47.920
or finally realized
your cooking is that bad?

02:47.920 --> 02:50.920
Ha! My milkshakes are legendary
on this island.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.000
Only because you can't burn
ice cream.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.380
Ouch.
Antihistamines.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.330
Uh, strong ones --
makes you drowsy.

02:57.330 --> 03:00.210
Next aisle...
to your right.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.080
Ah.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.790
Who's having
trouble sleeping?

03:05.790 --> 03:07.250
Just following a lead.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.250
On a Sunday morning?

03:09.250 --> 03:11.250
Will you stick it on
my house tab, will you?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.120
We're gonna settle this now!
I don't want to talk about it!

03:19.120 --> 03:20.710
Hey, hey, don't --
don't you walk away from --

03:20.710 --> 03:22.540
Get off!
Get off me!

03:22.540 --> 03:23.540
Hey!
You leave her alone!

03:23.540 --> 03:25.000
Come on, man!

03:25.000 --> 03:26.790
Leave her alone.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.710
You okay?
-I will be...

03:28.710 --> 03:31.170
...as soon as you give me
what I came here for.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.120
Whoever sent you,
I can pay you double.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.040
The diamonds.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.120
How'd you know
about those?

03:41.250 --> 03:42.960
They're in
the briefcase.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.920
Fine.
Have it your way.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.420
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! No!

04:05.420 --> 04:08.000
Aah!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.170
Ow.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.830
Get the briefcase.

04:12.830 --> 04:14.670
Single up the lines.
Ready to go.

04:22.420 --> 04:26.000
Aha.
I see you found the key.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.540
I'm glad you're here,
and I meant what I said.

04:28.540 --> 04:32.380
You are welcome here as often
and for as long as you like.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.420
Oh, calm down.
It's just a place to sleep.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.830
It's not like we're related
or anything.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.420
There's nothing in here.
Oh, well, you got wheels.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.080
Why don't you go shopping,
like a big girl?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.210
No, not anymore.
The cops took my minibike.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.040
Guess they don't like it when
you park on the sidewalk.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.710
Your boyfriend's
a cop, right?
Okay, whoa.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.920
Hold up right there.
Wyatt is not my boyfriend.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.580
We are...friends
with...benefits.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.040
Well, if he's
a friends-with-benefits,

04:56.040 --> 04:57.170
then he can
get my bike back.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.290
Mm, it doesn't really work
that way.

04:59.290 --> 05:00.710
What, you think
I can just, you know,

05:00.710 --> 05:02.960
ask him for the RPD
impound lot key

05:02.960 --> 05:04.250
and waltz out of there
with your minibike

05:04.250 --> 05:06.250
because I happen to be
sleeping with him?

05:06.250 --> 05:08.000
You owe me.
What do you think
all this is?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.210
If I don't get
my bike back,

05:09.210 --> 05:10.790
I'll have to hitchhike
everywhere.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.620
Guess you'll just have
to take the bus, then.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.710
9 ball, corner pocket.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.710
I could've shot you.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.880
Not the way you aim.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.080
How did you know?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.580
Oh, well, it was
your random grocery shopping.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.960
Red called me.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.830
Antihistamines and a truckload
of dog treats?

06:29.830 --> 06:31.250
You don't have a dog.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.250
How did you know
it was Doc's house?

06:33.250 --> 06:35.080
He's the only drug kingpin
on the island

06:35.080 --> 06:36.880
with killer guard dogs.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.790
You always were
the better criminal.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.620
I did put in
my 10,000 hours.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.170
What are we looking for?
Uh, no.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.120
We are not looking
for anything.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.580
Maybe I can help.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.000
No.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.290
It's not even here.

06:50.290 --> 06:53.620
So, how do you know
Doc's not in town?

06:53.620 --> 06:55.380
Oh,
he landed an hour ago.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.710
I had him arrested just before
the seat belt sign went off.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.420
Ah, so it's not
that you didn't have time

06:59.420 --> 07:00.880
to find a judge
to give you a search warrant.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.670
You just didn't want anyone
to know you were here.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.670
I could never fool you.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.750
Well, except for that time you
pretended to be a criminal,

07:06.750 --> 07:09.000
married me,
and then forgot to tell me

07:09.000 --> 07:11.830
that you were an undercover
FBI agent until our honeymoon.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.380
Wanna play 20 questions?

07:18.380 --> 07:19.460
Oh, absolutely not.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.880
You loved that game.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.290
Yeah, well, that was because
we were both very drunk

07:22.290 --> 07:24.750
and it always ended up
with something...

07:24.750 --> 07:27.080
inventive.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.670
Okay.
I'm just saying --

07:29.670 --> 07:30.960
-What?
-Whoa.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.920
Wyatt?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.210
-Hey.
-How -- How did you --

07:35.210 --> 07:38.830
Neighbor reported a middle-aged
man lurking by the gate.

07:38.830 --> 07:42.120
I was not lurking.
I -- What about Cat?

07:42.120 --> 07:43.580
Oh, Cat.
Cat's a ghost.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.290
No one ever sees
her coming.

07:45.290 --> 07:48.080
So, brief me on your casework
here, Special Agent,

07:48.080 --> 07:49.460
because nothing you find

07:49.460 --> 07:51.330
is gonna be admissible
in a court of law.

07:51.330 --> 07:52.960
Thanks for the legal advice,
Skippy.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.460
This --
This is why you rushed me?

07:54.460 --> 07:56.330
To help him with a B&E?
For the record,

07:56.330 --> 07:57.790
he was doing
the breaking and entering.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.420
I was just
shooting the breeze.

07:59.420 --> 08:02.040
Cole, here.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.540
Hey, it's Cat.

08:03.540 --> 08:05.620
Yeah.
You got aviation up?

08:05.620 --> 08:07.170
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm not busy.

08:07.170 --> 08:08.880
I'm on en route.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.210
Okay, I'm on my way.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.460
Don't worry.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.210
I'm sure yours
will ring soon, too.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.670
 Dax Melvoy.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.380
Lawyer, mouthpiece,
high-end lowlife.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.170
He was grabbed
and his yacht was hijacked

08:29.170 --> 08:32.380
two hours ago
from the marina.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.210
So, my mission,
should I choose to accept it,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.169
is to find Dax Melvoy?

08:37.169 --> 08:38.169
Why do you need me
for that?

08:38.169 --> 08:40.039
Dax is not
what's important here.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.330
The laptop that was taken
along with him is.

08:42.330 --> 08:44.330
Ahh.
What's on it?

08:44.330 --> 08:46.750
A video file that he tried to
sell the Governor this morning

08:46.750 --> 08:48.710
for $3 million.
Hmm.

08:48.710 --> 08:52.000
Then Carter Eastland offered
to pay $3.5 million.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.170
Let's just say that did not sit
well with the Governor.

08:54.170 --> 08:55.540
Interesting.

08:55.540 --> 08:56.670
You want to know
what your mission is?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.710
Yeah.

08:57.710 --> 08:59.080
Retrieve the laptop.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.210
Destroy the file
and all the copies.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.790
Put a smile
on the Governor's face.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.380
And above all,
do not let that file

09:04.380 --> 09:06.580
anywhere near
Carter Eastland.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.790
So, you guys think, what,
Eastland's behind this?

09:09.790 --> 09:11.540
First Law
of the Reef --

09:11.540 --> 09:13.250
whenever smoke blows
in the Governor's face,

09:13.250 --> 09:15.380
there's a good chance
Eastland set the fire.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.580
So, are you in?

09:18.580 --> 09:22.460
A kidnapping, a stolen yacht,
and secret video file

09:22.460 --> 09:25.670
that Eastland and the Governor
are in a race to find?

09:25.670 --> 09:27.540
Oh, yeah. I'm in.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.250
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.710
What is she
doing here?

09:37.710 --> 09:39.880
Cat's gonna be joining
the search and rescue operation

09:39.880 --> 09:42.120
in a consulting capacity
for the Governor's Office.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.290
Like a work release
program?

09:44.290 --> 09:46.500
You're joking, right?
Do I look like I'm joking?

09:46.500 --> 09:49.580
I love being in the middle
of all this brother/sister
sibling-rivalry stuff.

09:49.580 --> 09:50.790
Half-siblings.
Half-siblings.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.790
I could've given her a ride --
save the taxpayers some money.

09:54.790 --> 09:55.880
Ride from where?

09:55.880 --> 09:57.250
Hello?

09:57.250 --> 09:58.580
I have to take this.

09:58.580 --> 10:01.460
Still wondering what you
and your former lover

10:01.460 --> 10:02.620
were doing
at Doc Yulo's house.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.000
He's not my lover.
You are.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.790
He's my ex-husband.

10:05.790 --> 10:08.170
Listen, do I have
to pull rank on you?
You heard your sister.

10:08.170 --> 10:09.750
I want to see
the surveillance footage.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.960
This is the Reef.
People pay big money

10:11.960 --> 10:13.500
to make sure no one's filming
when they dock in the marina.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.880
Who is that?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.920
That is
Richard Stuyler --

10:16.920 --> 10:18.420
Carter Eastland's
Head of Security.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.880
You know, multi-billionaire
whose daughter's beach house

10:20.880 --> 10:22.210
you're currently
residing in.

10:22.210 --> 10:24.380
He certainly doesn't look like
your average rent-a-cop.

10:24.380 --> 10:26.670
He's not.
Ex-mercenary.

10:26.670 --> 10:28.620
Left a lot of dead bodies
in exotic locations.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.580
And now he does the same
for Carter Eastland?

10:30.580 --> 10:32.250
Not that anyone can prove...
yet.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.920
Detective Cole.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.000
Mr. Stuyler,
as I've already informed you,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.120
this is an active investigation
for police personnel only.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.380
Which one is she --
police or personnel?

10:41.380 --> 10:43.330
She's here at the
express request of the
Governor's Office --

10:43.330 --> 10:45.290
She is standing right here
and has a name and everything.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.790
Cat Chambers.
You're the so-called surfer

10:47.790 --> 10:50.170
who ratted out her pals
to avoid jail time.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.670
And you're
the so-called mercenary

10:51.670 --> 10:54.380
who does a bunch of shady stuff
for Carter Eastland.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.710
I think I'm gonna enjoy
getting to know you.

10:56.710 --> 10:57.920
Well, most people do.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.290
What is this, anyway?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.080
 Pinging off
Dax's briefcase.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.290
We're gonna send
a search party out.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.880
Well,
that's Hercules rock.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.210
So?

11:08.210 --> 11:10.460
So this is the place
us surfers refer to

11:10.460 --> 11:12.290
as the Reef's own
Bermuda Triangle.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.790
It's one of the few places
on Earth

11:13.790 --> 11:15.210
that a compass points
true north.

11:15.210 --> 11:16.420
As opposed to?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.830
Magnetic north.

11:18.830 --> 11:21.420
Oh, right -- your search party
is off by about 10 degrees.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.670
Sarge!

11:24.670 --> 11:25.750
Sarge.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.210
You're welcome.

11:45.380 --> 11:47.120
Hey!

11:47.120 --> 11:48.790
Ready out, guys.
Ready out.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.080
Alright, let's go.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.000
Hey! Hey!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.540
I'm over here!

11:53.540 --> 11:55.580
I'm here!

11:55.580 --> 11:56.580
Hey!

12:11.420 --> 12:13.830
Don't you have hell
to raise somewhere?

12:13.830 --> 12:16.500
Not today.
Cops took my minibike.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.250
I'm sorry, kid.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.790
Don't be sorry.
Help me get it back.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.620
Yeah, I would,
but I-I have a strict

12:24.620 --> 12:27.420
"don't help people if it's gonna
land you in jail" policy.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.380
Yeah, but you don't have
to come to the station.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.790
I just need someone
to help me pay the fine,

12:30.790 --> 12:32.750
and you have 500 bucks,
right?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.620
What life lesson
would you be learning

12:34.620 --> 12:38.080
if I just handed out 500 bucks
with no strings attached?

12:38.080 --> 12:40.750
Oh, I see. So, I'm supposed
to learn about life

12:40.750 --> 12:43.250
from a career criminal
with fast food running
through his veins.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.960
Just because
I don't play by the rules

12:44.960 --> 12:46.290
doesn't mean I don't know
what they are.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.620
Besides,
you need sweet-talking?

12:49.620 --> 12:52.290
I'm not your guy.
Ask Cat.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.380
I did.
She said no.

12:56.330 --> 12:58.120
She'll do it.
Didn't seem that way.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.170
Yeah, well,
there will be a price.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.710
But she'll get
your bike.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.210
Look, man, they may not have
been wearing eye patches

13:08.210 --> 13:10.290
and, uh, sporting parrots
on their shoulders,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.750
but they were pirates.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.380
They dumped me and took off
across the high sea.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.460
I'm lucky I didn't die.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.250
It was a salt spray gun?
They broke the skin.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.880
You ever heard
of staph infection?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.120
What'd they take?

13:24.580 --> 13:27.790
Uh, a bag of diamonds.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.750
Not the kind you take
out of Grandma's safety
deposit box, either.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.330
Someone tipped them off.

13:32.330 --> 13:34.330
Says here you were
an attorney.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.670
It also says that you filed for
Chapter 11 three years ago

13:36.670 --> 13:38.750
and you've been on the run
from the IRS ever since.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.250
Listen to me.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.790
The kind of enemies
I have,

13:43.790 --> 13:46.710
they don't leave you alive
in the middle of the ocean.

13:46.710 --> 13:49.710
There is something else
going on here.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.000
If this is the same crew,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.120
it's the seventh attack
in the past two years.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.380
But always at sea,
before this.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.000
Hmm.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.330
Alright.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.040
Maybe...

14:03.040 --> 14:04.330
they knew what was on
that laptop

14:04.330 --> 14:06.290
and that's why
they changed their M.O.

14:06.290 --> 14:08.920
Well, in the past, they robbed
cash and high-end goods --

14:08.920 --> 14:10.790
spoils of wealth.

14:10.790 --> 14:12.880
Okay,
so Dax mentioned...

14:12.880 --> 14:14.830
diamonds.
Mm-hmm.

14:14.830 --> 14:17.210
Maybe they didn't know
what was on the laptop

14:17.210 --> 14:19.670
and they just took it
by mistake.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.960
You know what's on that laptop,
don't you?

14:21.960 --> 14:24.000
I have an idea.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.380
Do you want to share it
with me?

14:27.670 --> 14:29.500
Guess that's a "no."

14:29.500 --> 14:32.580
Trust issue.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.540
Thanks.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.170
That was Doc Yulo.
Who?

14:55.170 --> 14:56.500
He walked
right past you.

14:58.210 --> 14:59.880
I didn't notice.
-You didn't notice?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.330
You throw him in jail,

15:01.330 --> 15:04.120
break into his house,
ransacked his house,

15:04.120 --> 15:07.080
and you don't notice him
2 feet away from you?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.960
What are you
doing here, anyway?

15:08.960 --> 15:11.420
Oh, hey, I could ask you
the same thing.
Mm.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.960
I mean, I thought you
were trying to stay out
of police stations.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.380
Well,
this is the only place

15:15.380 --> 15:17.080
I can find myself
a vintage minibike.

15:20.790 --> 15:23.000
Last known location
was 4th Street.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.460
You pick up any prints?

15:24.460 --> 15:25.580
Unfortunately, not.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.120
But we did get this.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.420
Take a look.
CCTV picked him up 3rd --

15:29.420 --> 15:32.170
Hey. You got a minute?
Not really.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.250
Oh, well,
I need to talk to you.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.960
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.330
Oh, you don't mind,
right?

15:37.330 --> 15:39.170
I was just getting
a cup of coffee.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.540
You want one?
-I want one.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.540
Now you got a minute.
You think talking to Tolan's
all I have to do today?

15:45.540 --> 15:46.920
Probably not,
but I have no plans,

15:46.920 --> 15:48.290
so I can stand here
and talk to you all day.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.750
What do you want?
You remember Petra,

15:49.750 --> 15:51.500
that -- that girl
I bailed out?
Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.330
Well, her minibike
was impounded, okay?

15:54.330 --> 15:55.420
You let me wheel it
outta here,

15:55.420 --> 15:57.170
I'll leave you alone
in peace and quiet.

15:57.170 --> 15:59.830
You know, as great as that
sounds, I can't really do that.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.460
Wyatt, I told you.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.120
I have a complicated history
with Petra.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.290
I just -- I want to get
this bike back for her.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.460
Please help me.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.500
You're serious,
aren't you?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.710
Hey!

16:26.710 --> 16:28.580
Otter!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.330
To what do I owe
the honor?

16:33.330 --> 16:36.120
Well, as a matter of fact,
I did you a solid,

16:36.120 --> 16:40.500
and I got Petra's minibike out
of the impound and back for her.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.000
But before I give it to her,
I need a favor from you.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.290
Ha!

16:44.290 --> 16:45.750
Yeah, well, uh,
whatever you want,

16:45.750 --> 16:48.580
that's Petra's bill to pay,
not mine.
Fine.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.380
I'll just take it right back
to the police station,

16:50.380 --> 16:52.250
have them put it back
in the impound lot,

16:52.250 --> 16:54.040
then I'll tell Petra
that the reason

16:54.040 --> 16:55.790
she doesn't have
her beloved minibike

16:55.790 --> 16:57.920
is because of
her good friend Otter.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.500
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.790
See, Petra already hates me,
so I've got nothing to lose.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.460
But you...

17:04.460 --> 17:08.210
she thinks of you as -- as
a father figure and a friend.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.540
But don't worry.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.420
She can always find another one
of those on the street.

17:14.619 --> 17:17.829
Fine.
What do you want?

17:17.829 --> 17:20.170
Talk to me
about the pirates.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.710
They're stealing
high-end goods.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.250
Some of it must've moved
through you.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.420
I want to know
everything you know.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.040
Robin Hood stuff.
Mm.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.960
Okay, stealing from rich folk
to survive.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.380
Living off the grid.
How far off the grid?

17:37.540 --> 17:39.670
The last honest-to-goodness map
of the Reef

17:39.670 --> 17:41.210
before Eastland
started, uh,

17:41.210 --> 17:43.170
rewriting geography
to hide his oil.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.920
Where the hell
did you get this?

17:44.920 --> 17:46.880
Well, remember when the Eastland
mansion was burgled

17:46.880 --> 17:48.040
a few years back?

17:48.040 --> 17:49.920
You're telling me
you moved stolen loot

17:49.920 --> 17:53.330
from Carter Eastland's mansion
through this dump?

17:53.330 --> 17:55.620
Otter, I'm impressed.
You got guts.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.040
Yeah.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.420
My guts are all fast food.
Ew.

17:59.420 --> 18:02.580
But whoever did left some
very nice rugs back there.

18:02.580 --> 18:05.580
I guess they thought this
roughed-up piece of paper
wasn't worth anything.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.790
Yeah, well...

18:07.790 --> 18:10.540
I guess this roughed-up
piece of paper

18:10.540 --> 18:12.500
is worth one minibike.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.000
Nice work, Otter.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.540
Just make sure
she gets it!

18:16.540 --> 18:18.170
I will.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.330
See ya!

19:20.540 --> 19:22.880
Really, Cat?
Stealing a boat?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.620
What,
are you following me?

19:25.620 --> 19:27.460
You're under arrest.
Really?

19:27.460 --> 19:29.290
Absolutely.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.750
It's interesting
what you didn't say.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.920
Wait, what?

19:33.920 --> 19:35.670
Stop.

19:35.670 --> 19:36.670
Wh--

19:47.420 --> 19:49.670
Bit of burglary yesterday,
some grand theft today.

19:49.670 --> 19:50.750
What am I meant
to do with you?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.250
Well, I thought I made
that pretty clear --

19:52.250 --> 19:54.670
but we can go over our safeword
again, if you'd like.

19:54.670 --> 19:57.120
Any chance that you just tell me
what the plan is?
Nope.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.580
Look, I get it.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.120
You walk
between the raindrops,

20:00.120 --> 20:02.210
but you are going to need me --
maybe sooner than you think.

20:02.210 --> 20:03.880
Now, is that your attempt
to scare me?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.000
Because you are standing
on my boat...
That you stole.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.880
...not arresting,
and I wonder why that is.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.420
Well, I don't know. You seem
to have all the answers.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.250
 Maybe it's because you're
seven acts of piracy in,

20:11.250 --> 20:13.080
RPD doesn't have any leads,
I do,

20:13.080 --> 20:15.710
and you want to ride
my coattails.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.250
Okay.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.880
You can come.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.500
But you gotta throw your radio
and your phone overboard.

20:21.500 --> 20:25.040
I don't want RPD
following us.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.710
Wow, you're more desperate
than I thought.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.420
A little.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.040
What's up, Doc?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.710
Is that why
you threw me jail?

21:07.710 --> 21:10.880
To give you time to come up
with such a clever line?

21:10.880 --> 21:13.710
Never was much
of a wordsmith.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.880
More a man of action.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.540
"Was" being
the operative word here.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.790
Hmm.

21:19.790 --> 21:22.380
Now it seems...

21:22.380 --> 21:25.170
we have
some new business.

21:25.170 --> 21:27.620
Really?

21:27.620 --> 21:31.830
DEA wasn't notified
that you were in custody.

21:31.830 --> 21:33.170
We both know
that they've held

21:33.170 --> 21:36.170
an open warrant on you
for years.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.250
I'm looking for a watch,

21:38.250 --> 21:40.790
and you got the biggest
collection on the Reef.

21:40.790 --> 21:42.620
You're shaking me down
for a watch?

21:45.830 --> 21:48.750
You and I both know
that you risked your warrant

21:48.750 --> 21:50.040
to see your daughter.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.080
It'd be a real shame
if she got caught up

21:52.080 --> 21:54.750
in some kind of illegal
harboring-a-fugitive situation.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.380
Remind me again.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.580
Which watch in particular
were you looking for?

22:08.120 --> 22:10.460
We'll finally get to spend
the morning together.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.120
Well...was it everything
you imagined it would be?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.880
Check it out.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.880
If I'm being honest,
there were less...

22:16.880 --> 22:18.620
nautical charts
involved.

22:18.620 --> 22:22.880
I've marked where all the
previous attacks took place.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.540
You know, my experience comes
from actual police work,

22:24.540 --> 22:26.290
not binge-watching
"Law & Order."

22:26.290 --> 22:27.710
Yeah, well, mine
comes from Nancy Drew.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.330
That girl was a badass.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.920
Based on a description of their
boat and their fuel consumption,

22:31.920 --> 22:33.330
there's not a single reef
close enough

22:33.330 --> 22:34.420
for them to use
as a base.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.750
Maybe not on your map.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.830
Way back in the day,
Carter Eastland's father

22:38.830 --> 22:40.250
doctored all those maps

22:40.250 --> 22:42.960
to omit certain beneficial
geographic locations

22:42.960 --> 22:45.830
so he could corner
the Reef's oil market.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.670
Ran across a few back when I was
looking for new spots to surf.

22:50.290 --> 22:51.420
That's your plan.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.210
The two of us --
we storm an island?

22:53.210 --> 22:55.500
My plan
was to fly solo.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.210
I think your plan
was to get me out here

22:58.210 --> 23:01.040
in the middle of nowhere
and take advantage of me.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.170
Well, here we are, Romeo.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.880
Yes.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.040
Yes, I understand
the timely nature f--

23:11.040 --> 23:13.750
Absolutely, Governor.
Talk soon.

23:16.420 --> 23:19.380
You wanted to see me?

23:19.380 --> 23:20.880
Sober.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.290
I can handle it.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.420
I look forward to the day
when you can handle

23:26.420 --> 23:28.710
more than a bottle
of beer.

23:28.710 --> 23:30.120
Like doing your job.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.250
Oh, don't you worry
about my job.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.880
You worry about yours,
handling Cat.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.500
You don't think
I can handle her.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.080
No one can.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.040
Not me. Not you.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.210
And certainly not
that little brother of yours.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.500
This assignment -- it's very
important to the Governor,

23:48.500 --> 23:51.120
but I am having some trouble
communicating with her.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.210
Well, get used to it.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.460
Welcome to the unruly world
of Cat Chambers.

24:12.460 --> 24:13.500
Here we are.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.880
Where?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.540
Ground zero
for the pirate attacks.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.620
So, what, we decoy them
into attacking us?

24:19.620 --> 24:20.750
Sounds promising.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.960
Take it easy, John Wick.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.170
None of the attacks happen
before noon.

24:25.170 --> 24:27.170
They're pirates.
They like their sleep.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.170
Ah, so what
you're saying is...

24:29.170 --> 24:30.920
make hay
while the sun shines.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.750
No one has said that
for like 50 years.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.000
Not even --

24:39.540 --> 24:43.620
Well, it looks like
we've got a shadow.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.170
Come here.
Check it out for yourself.

24:50.170 --> 24:51.620
They're not doing anything,
though.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.210
Oh, no. See?
That's just our backup.

24:59.210 --> 25:00.920
I ditched my phone
and my radio

25:00.920 --> 25:03.040
but not the tracking device
on my belt.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.420
Oh.
Well, that's a good thing.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.210
You're gonna need
a ride home.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.120
-Hey!
-Sorry!

25:13.120 --> 25:15.040
Wait!
You need backup.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.710
Well, you know, I also need
to get to that stolen briefcase

25:17.710 --> 25:21.210
before anyone else,
including you.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.580
No.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.460
Cat. Hey!

25:25.460 --> 25:26.500
Cat!

25:26.500 --> 25:28.710
Whew. Okay.

26:02.540 --> 26:04.880
Oh, uh, hey.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.330
Uh, c-can I help --

26:06.330 --> 26:08.960
Oh, okay. Yeah, um...

26:08.960 --> 26:11.250
Where is she?

26:11.250 --> 26:13.080
Where is Cat Chambers?

26:59.750 --> 27:01.710
-Did she follow us here?
-Didn't follow us.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.880
We've never seen her before.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.170
How did you find us?

27:18.380 --> 27:20.830
Well, I used to be
kind of a pirate myself.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.330
 Thanks for
the change of clothes.

27:28.330 --> 27:30.460
Aero got anything?

27:30.460 --> 27:32.830
 No, but the trees
are so dense on these islands,

27:32.830 --> 27:34.330
they could be 10 feet over
and not know.

27:34.330 --> 27:35.580
Get another patrol
on the search grid.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.880
Hire locals
if you have to.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.380
Roger that.

27:39.380 --> 27:42.290
Wait, wait.

27:42.290 --> 27:43.960
Here.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.080
There's nothing there.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.250
Trust me. Let's go.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.460
Call the SWAT.
Copy that.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.790
Alright, let's get all units.
All units.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.920
Whoa. Cat Chambers.
The surfer, right?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.880
From the
Shorepound Syndicate?
Yeah.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.750
I remember ditching school
for weeks to watch that trial.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.420
You're a real badass.
Wow. Well, thank you.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.040
Seems like you're doing
pretty well yourself

28:19.040 --> 28:21.380
in that department.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.540
Who are you?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.880
I'm Raven.
These are my people.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.120
So you decided
to start over?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.710
Like the First Reefers.

28:34.710 --> 28:37.000
Except the First Reefers
weren't committing armed robbery

28:37.000 --> 28:38.540
and stealing
uncut diamonds.

28:38.540 --> 28:41.120
We only take what we need to
keep ourselves clothed, fed,

28:41.120 --> 28:42.830
and functioning
off the grid.

28:42.830 --> 28:44.380
Hey, I hear you.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.210
There was a time
not very long ago

28:46.210 --> 28:48.420
where I was
a lot like you guys.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.170
I wanted
to leave it all behind,

28:50.170 --> 28:53.120
shun society,
didn't trust anyone.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.750
And now?

28:54.750 --> 28:58.080
Now I'm easing my way back in.
I'm, uh, freelancing.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.290
Whole different
skill set.

28:59.290 --> 29:01.250
And who pays for that?

29:01.250 --> 29:03.420
Today, the Governor.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.420
Your last score,
you took something.

29:05.420 --> 29:07.120
He wants it.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.330
Must be special
if he sent you to get it.

29:10.330 --> 29:12.290
In a briefcase,

29:12.290 --> 29:15.420
next to those uncut diamonds
you stole,

29:15.420 --> 29:18.120
is a laptop
with a file on it.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.620
What's on it?

29:19.620 --> 29:21.040
I don't know.

29:38.750 --> 29:40.750
I'm gonna look at
the last file he opened.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.080
You know...I think I should
watch it first,

29:50.080 --> 29:52.000
just for
your own safety, okay?

29:59.880 --> 30:01.250
Oh, the Governor.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.210
You shouldn't see
what's on this computer.

30:10.210 --> 30:12.580
No one should.
For your own protection.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.580
But the money I can get you
for what's on here,

30:14.580 --> 30:17.040
it'll keep you guys afloat
for a long time.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.960
I know how to negotiate
with these people.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.420
I can get you
a lot of money.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.880
But you said you worked
for the Governor.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.080
You know, I-I work
for my conscience.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.420
And the Governor's price to
rent, it just went way up.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.830
I can help you.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.210
But you have to trust me.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.380
Deal?

30:37.790 --> 30:40.750
Everyone, on the ground now!
On the ground!

30:40.750 --> 30:42.960
On the ground!

30:44.170 --> 30:46.290
Get on the ground!

30:46.290 --> 30:47.500
On the ground now!

30:47.500 --> 30:49.580
Stuyler.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.380
Cat Chambers!

30:51.380 --> 30:54.500
Get your ass out here now!

30:54.500 --> 30:57.670
And bring me that computer.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.330
Shoot.

30:59.330 --> 31:02.080
I'll start shooting
in 10 seconds.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.170
Nine...
-I'm gonna give him the laptop.

31:05.170 --> 31:06.750
No, no.
That's a bad idea.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.380
I'm not letting
my people die.
...seven...

31:08.380 --> 31:10.250
-You said it's worth millions.
-It is.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.670
That's why Stuyler is not
allowed to get his hands on it.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.210
Listen.

31:14.210 --> 31:15.750
You said you would trust me,
right?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.000
So what do we do?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.420
...three...

31:19.420 --> 31:20.210
two...

31:22.830 --> 31:24.750
...one!
This one is on you, Cat!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.880
Hey!

31:26.880 --> 31:29.920
Why don't you and your thugs
get out of here?

31:29.920 --> 31:32.000
There's nothing for you.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.080
You have something
that Mr. Eastland wants.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.380
How'd you find me,
anyway?

31:37.380 --> 31:40.880
Your pal Otter.
He gave you up for a song.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.750
A song or a sandwich?

31:42.750 --> 31:46.040
Otter's notorious
for his cheap prices.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.710
Laptop. Now.

31:50.210 --> 31:51.880
You want it now?

31:51.880 --> 31:53.540
He wants the laptop!

32:02.290 --> 32:04.710
It's worthless.

32:04.710 --> 32:06.920
Copy of that file is already
on its way to the Governor.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.500
See, in this game, if you're
not first, you're last.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
This place
hasn't got electricity.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.540
Let alone Internet.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.380
Password.

32:17.620 --> 32:19.830
Flare.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.250
A-R-E or A-I-R?

32:27.040 --> 32:28.080
Now!

32:37.170 --> 32:38.460
Flares!

32:38.460 --> 32:40.080
Let 'em have it!

32:40.080 --> 32:41.460
What the hell
were you thinking?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.920
RPD!
Put your guns down!

32:45.920 --> 32:47.620
RPD!
Put your guns down!

32:47.620 --> 32:49.540
Guns down!

32:49.540 --> 32:51.210
 Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

32:51.210 --> 32:53.330
-RPD. Guns down.
-Stand down.

32:53.330 --> 32:54.750
-Show me your hands.
-Stand down.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.710
I can't believe you let Stuyler
beat you here.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.670
I did leave you a map.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.290
Yeah, then you
took it with you.

33:00.290 --> 33:01.500
Oh, yeah.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.540
-Evacuate these hostages.
-Secure!

33:02.540 --> 33:04.120
-Back it up, Mr. Stuyler.
-Backing up.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.330
We're leaving.

33:05.330 --> 33:07.710
Nice job.
Yeah.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.040
Nice doing business
with you.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.710
You're a real badass.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.580
Well, likewise.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.080
Take care.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.750
It's like it's Christmas
over here.

33:48.750 --> 33:49.750
My bike!

33:49.750 --> 33:51.710
Bike.

33:51.710 --> 33:54.330
Well, I figured the bus system
on the Reef kind of sucks.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.880
And anyway...

33:55.880 --> 33:58.710
I know it's more than just
transportation to you.

33:58.710 --> 34:01.420
Yeah, actually, my dad gave it
to me for my 10th birthday.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.420
As I recall, it's so you would
stop bugging him for rides.

34:11.330 --> 34:12.960
You know,
you can't buy me off.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.580
Oh, come on.
Just this once?

34:14.580 --> 34:16.620
I mean,
I got your bike back.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.670
Be careful!

34:39.500 --> 34:42.330
How did you find me?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.920
Duty Sergeant
said you'd be here.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.920
He will answer for that.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.420
I just wanted to let you know
my Cat situation worked out.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.540
Somehow.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.580
Told ya.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.250
It's nice here.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.120
It's so quiet.
No phones, no e-mails.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.710
You should try it
sometime.

35:01.710 --> 35:03.620
Maybe.
In my next life.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.920
I'll be here.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.460
That all
you came here for?

35:11.460 --> 35:12.880
See you later, Jake.

35:18.460 --> 35:20.040
Just a sec.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.290
 Hi.
Hey.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.380
Heard you kinda
saved the day today.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.580
Kinda, maybe.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.040
Sort of.
A little bit.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.000
Are you looking for me?
No.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But it is a pleasure,
as always, sis.

35:43.330 --> 35:44.670
Hey.

35:44.670 --> 35:45.880
Don't tell me.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.830
The Duty Sergeant ratted me out
to you, too.

35:48.830 --> 35:50.500
No, it was actually
the "Gone Fishing" sign

35:50.500 --> 35:52.210
that gave you away.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.540
You, uh, catch anything?

35:54.540 --> 35:57.500
That's not really the point.
Take a seat.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.960
Well...

35:58.960 --> 36:00.380
So, what is it
with this, uh,

36:00.380 --> 36:02.170
"Old Man and The Sea"
routine, huh?

36:02.170 --> 36:04.210
Peace and quiet.

36:04.210 --> 36:07.000
Just came by to make sure
after Doc Yulo's...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.210
you, me, and Cat --
we're cool, yeah?

36:09.210 --> 36:10.420
It's none of my business.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.620
And hey.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.380
I'd like to keep it
that way.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.080
Been asking around
about you.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.920
Why don't you tell somebody
who gives a damn?

36:22.920 --> 36:24.170
You're quite a legend
around these parts.

36:24.170 --> 36:25.670
Well, legends are born
of myths,

36:25.670 --> 36:27.170
and myths are born
of fairy tales.

36:27.170 --> 36:29.250
You believe in fairy tales,
Detective?

36:29.250 --> 36:31.250
I think there's a little truth
in everything.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.710
Cases you solved,
the ladies you romanced,

36:33.710 --> 36:35.170
the benders you went on
afterwards.

36:35.170 --> 36:36.620
Okay, so this is
where you ask me,

36:36.620 --> 36:38.750
"Didn't I used to be
Jake Elliot?"

36:38.750 --> 36:40.210
No.

36:40.210 --> 36:41.540
No, I think he's
still in there somewhere.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.620
Boy, do you know how to spoil
a perfectly good --

36:44.620 --> 36:46.330
Hang on.
I know why you're here.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.040
You're here
because you're worried

36:49.040 --> 36:52.380
that you might turn into
something like me.

36:52.380 --> 36:54.880
No.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.000
No, I don't think so.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You're damn right.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.710
You gotta earn
your reputation first

37:00.710 --> 37:02.330
before you can lose it.

37:06.210 --> 37:07.540
What are you using,
live bait?

37:07.540 --> 37:09.580
Octopus?
Yeah. Yep.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.790
Should try a lure
next time.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.210
Might get a bite.

37:13.210 --> 37:14.920
So you're not just a pretty face
after all, huh?

37:17.040 --> 37:19.330
You find Jake Elliot
in there,

37:19.330 --> 37:21.580
tell him we finally could use
someone like him again.

37:33.790 --> 37:37.790
So, my first official mission
for the Governor's Office.

37:37.790 --> 37:41.040
How did I do?

37:41.040 --> 37:43.380
I see a pattern
forming here.

37:43.380 --> 37:46.170
I ask you to do one
thing, you do something
completely different.

37:46.170 --> 37:49.290
Well, you hire Cat Chambers,
you get all of Cat Chambers.

37:49.290 --> 37:51.500
I assume the Governor's
happy with my result.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.170
Stuyler wound up
with egg on his face

37:53.170 --> 37:54.460
and a first-degree burn.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.750
The Governor thinks
you're Erin Brockovich.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.750
He's agreed the pirates
will be left alone,

37:58.750 --> 38:01.330
as long as they keep their
Robin Hood act off the Reef.

38:01.330 --> 38:03.500
And Dax
is going stateside.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.290
It's nice to know
the Reef's still willing

38:05.290 --> 38:08.080
to observe the occasional
U.S. law, like blackmail.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.210
Mission accomplished.

38:11.210 --> 38:13.380
Did you see what was on the file
before it was destroyed?

38:13.380 --> 38:14.580
No.

38:14.580 --> 38:15.880
You're a good liar.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.420
You know...
one time a long time ago,

38:23.420 --> 38:27.120
I stole a really nice watch
off a really bad man,

38:27.120 --> 38:29.960
and I gave it to the man
I loved.

38:29.960 --> 38:33.210
But I knew he wouldn't take it
if he knew where it came from,

38:33.210 --> 38:36.210
so I made up this whole story
about where I got it.

38:36.210 --> 38:37.380
It was really corny.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.210
Something about
my mom and my dad

38:39.210 --> 38:41.290
and their wedding day.

38:41.290 --> 38:42.380
Did he buy it?

38:44.750 --> 38:47.170
Let me guess.
Jake Elliot?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.210
I will see you around.

39:18.330 --> 39:20.880
Hi.
I didn't think you'd come.

39:43.210 --> 39:47.750
Well...the success of your --
of your mission.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.420
Well, you could've just sent me
a congratulations emoji.

40:02.750 --> 40:06.120
Oh, my gosh.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.250
You got it back.

40:08.250 --> 40:11.170
It turns out Doc's
quite the romantic.

40:13.420 --> 40:16.710
Well, I haven't seen this...
since that night.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.420
Yeah, yeah.
I r--

40:18.420 --> 40:20.540
I remember I --
I woke up.

40:20.540 --> 40:23.080
I hear--
I heard something.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.830
Went to check
what time it was.

40:24.830 --> 40:27.120
And that's when the shooter
came in.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.330
Yeah, and, uh...
the bullet...

40:30.330 --> 40:32.670
was a couple
of inches...

40:32.670 --> 40:34.080
from my heart.

40:36.750 --> 40:39.290
Reaching for this watch
saved your life.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.380
No, Cat.

40:43.380 --> 40:44.460
You saved my life.

40:47.540 --> 40:51.210
I-I-I remember the story,
um, you told me

40:51.210 --> 40:53.500
when you surprised me
with this.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.330
Uh, how your -- your mom
gave it to your father

40:56.330 --> 40:57.580
on their wedding day

40:57.580 --> 41:00.380
and how she sold
her diamond earrings to get it.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.710
Yeah, that's --

41:03.710 --> 41:06.380
Yeah.
Mm.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.880
You are a sucker
for a good story.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.380
Um...

41:10.380 --> 41:11.710
You know, I...

41:11.710 --> 41:13.920
I know it...

41:13.920 --> 41:16.420
might be...

41:16.420 --> 41:18.000
too late for us,
but...

41:21.540 --> 41:26.830
...you...here
on the Reef --

41:26.830 --> 41:28.250
seeing you again...

41:30.830 --> 41:32.920
...it made me remember...

41:32.920 --> 41:37.880
the man I was and --
and it gave me a hint...

41:37.880 --> 41:39.250
to the man
I might yet be.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.830
Thank you.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.580
I want you to keep this.

41:50.580 --> 41:52.790
No, no.
No, you keep it.

41:55.170 --> 41:56.830
You know,
that way, um...

41:59.170 --> 42:00.710
...I'll have an excuse
to come by

42:00.710 --> 42:02.210
whenever
I want to wear it.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.750
Well, alright, then.
