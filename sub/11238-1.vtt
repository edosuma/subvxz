Pika.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.360
Pi.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.640
Pikachu.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.560
Well, Pikachu, we're here.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.520
lt's a Pokémon paradise.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.720
-This looks like tons of fun.
-Yeah, the Pokémon love it.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.720
Just keep your eye on
Togepi, okay, Pikachu?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.280
Come on, come on, come on

01:49.560 --> 01:51.280
Let's go

02:02.160 --> 02:04.640
Vacation, need a little sun

02:04.920 --> 02:08.759
I'm going to get my friends
together and have a little fun

02:09.080 --> 02:12.680
Ain't nobody going to
tell us what we going to do

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Because today it's up to me and you

02:17.360 --> 02:19.840
Temptation calling out to me

02:20.120 --> 02:23.120
A little relaxation I'll be free to be

02:23.400 --> 02:25.560
Come on and wicky-wicky lou

02:25.880 --> 02:28.200
I do believe it'll start now

02:28.480 --> 02:30.160
Kick it back to the track

02:32.480 --> 02:35.480
Vacation's where I want to be

02:35.760 --> 02:38.760
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

02:39.080 --> 02:42.960
We don't need a holiday
to start to celebrate

02:43.280 --> 02:48.040
Repeat after me: I need a vacation

02:53.960 --> 02:55.520
Let's go

03:02.760 --> 03:05.840
Vacation's where I want to be

03:06.120 --> 03:09.240
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

03:11.280 --> 03:13.360
We don't need a holiday
to start to celebrate

03:13.680 --> 03:17.640
Because I need a break,
I need a vacation

03:17.920 --> 03:20.880
Vacation's where I want to be

03:21.160 --> 03:24.160
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

03:25.360 --> 03:28.400
Pokédex observation unit
now activating.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.440
My function: Monitor
Pokémon activity...

03:31.720 --> 03:35.080
...to understand behavioral
patterns of the Pokémon...

03:35.360 --> 03:39.040
...when they are in a state
of total relaxation.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.560
Togepi, the Egg Pokémon.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.640
It exhibits a low
tolerance for hunger.

04:11.640 --> 04:17.360
It is able to communicate this
condition in a very effective manner.

04:25.600 --> 04:30.160
Pika, Pika. Pikachu.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.160
Squirt.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
Saur.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.880
Psy.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.040
Bulbasaur

05:41.440 --> 05:45.920
Bulba, bulba

05:46.200 --> 05:48.800
Bulbasaur

05:50.600 --> 05:55.800
This is the first known recording
of ''Bulbasaur's Bulbabye. ''

06:02.320 --> 06:03.880
Bellsprout.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.560
Bellsprout.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.120
Activating Pokémon database.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.880
Snubble, a newly discovered Pokémon.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.160
A Ground-type Pokémon, Cubone.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.800
Cubone-bone-bone.
Cubone-bone-bone-bone.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.400
Raichu, the evolved form of Pikachu.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.600
Marril.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.280
Marril, a Water-type Pokémon.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.600

07:13.840 --> 07:15.000
Rai.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.400
-Squirtle.
-Bulbasaur.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.720
Pokémon do not battle unless
directed by their trainers.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.800
Translation activated.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.760
''Let's set a good example
for the baby. ''

08:20.600 --> 08:21.840
lKarp.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.920
Togepi.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.560
Slooooooooow.

11:10.320 --> 11:15.200
Pokémon enjoy competition,
but not always in Pokémon battles.

11:15.480 --> 11:20.640
It's not uncommon for Pokémon to
challenge each other in contests.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
Oh come on, try to catch me

11:43.520 --> 11:45.960
Oh catch me if you can

11:47.080 --> 11:49.440
Oh come on, try to catch me

11:49.720 --> 11:51.560
Oh catch me if you can

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
-Exeggutor.
-Oddish.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.040
-Exeggutor.
-Oddish.

13:54.280 --> 13:59.440
Pikachu and Raichu are both
Mouse Pokémon of the electric variety.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.520
Combined voltage approaching
shockingly dangerous levels.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.320
This is the perfect place
for a comfy catnap.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.120
What's that?

15:16.760 --> 15:19.640
What's the rush?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.680
Farfetch'd, Farfetch'd....

15:32.400 --> 15:34.880
Hitmonlee.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.080
Chansey, Chansey.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.800
lKeep it down!

17:44.960 --> 17:46.440
Mag.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.680
Magne. Ma.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.760
Magnemites!

20:15.480 --> 20:19.360
Cubone earned its classification
as the Lonely Pokémon...

20:19.640 --> 20:23.440
...from its usual attitude
of caring only...

20:23.720 --> 20:25.280
...for itself.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.080
l told you to keep quiet!

21:29.240 --> 21:32.640
Well, this ought to
shut you all up, you--

21:42.360 --> 21:43.520
Duck.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.840
l think l'll take my nap right here.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.440
Good night.

22:13.680 --> 22:18.560
Preliminary analysis: Pokémon,
by nature, are friendly creatures...

22:18.840 --> 22:22.160
...and prefer cooperation
to confrontation.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.560
Final conclusion:

23:07.880 --> 23:09.720
Despite earlier uncertainties...

23:10.000 --> 23:13.880
...Pokémon vacations are
highly recommended.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.760
Pokédex observation unit
now deactivating.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.960
Pikachu, it's time to leave!

23:36.600 --> 23:38.760
Goldeen! Staryu! Psyduck!
Come on back!

23:39.080 --> 23:43.200
Geodude! Onix! Zubat!
Vulpix! We got to go!

24:33.720 --> 24:35.640
Did you have fun?

25:50.560 --> 25:51.960
Life.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.840
The great miracle and
the great mystery.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.240
Who am I?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.040
Since the beginning...

26:07.280 --> 26:12.440
...humans and Pokémon alike
have searched for its meaning.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.600
What am I? What am I?

26:16.840 --> 26:20.120
Many strange and wondrous
legends evolved...

26:20.360 --> 26:23.560
...from the pursuit
of life's mysteries.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.800
Where am I? Where am I?

26:31.960 --> 26:35.120
But none is stranger
than this tale...

26:35.360 --> 26:39.160
...of the most powerful
Pokémon of all.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.560
I am ready...

26:44.720 --> 26:46.280
...to be, to be....

27:09.120 --> 27:10.720
Where...

27:11.920 --> 27:13.680
...am I?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.440
This is not the same.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.400
Was everything before just a dream?

27:26.400 --> 27:28.840
Why?

27:33.280 --> 27:36.600
-Doctor, look at this.
-What?

27:36.920 --> 27:39.680
lts brain waves, they're surging!

27:39.920 --> 27:42.160
-Let me see!
-She's right!

27:42.400 --> 27:45.400
-Let's run another scan.
-lts mind is racing!

27:47.760 --> 27:49.080
Those voices.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.680
l hope we don't lose this one!

27:51.560 --> 27:53.080
They're outside.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.400
We can't!

27:55.000 --> 27:57.280
Where I must be.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.920
Tell Giovanni what's happened!

28:12.160 --> 28:13.640
Quiet!

28:14.320 --> 28:17.240
Let us hear its psychic powers.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.480
Psychic powers?

28:21.080 --> 28:26.720
For years we struggled to successfully
clone a Pokémon to prove our theories.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.720
You're the first specimen to survive!

28:29.960 --> 28:32.680
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokémon.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.760
From its DNA we created you, Mewtwo.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.680
Mewtwo?

28:40.400 --> 28:44.880
Am l only a copy?
Nothing but Mew's shadow?

28:45.320 --> 28:46.880
You are greater than Mew.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.640
lmproved through the power
of human ingenuity.

28:51.440 --> 28:56.440
We used the most advanced techniques
to develop your psychic powers.

28:57.680 --> 29:01.920
So l am simply the end
result of your experiment.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.520
What becomes of me now?

29:05.840 --> 29:09.240
Our experiment isn't over!
lt's just beginning!

29:09.480 --> 29:11.320
Now the serious testing begins.

29:11.880 --> 29:16.040
These humans, they care
nothing for me.

29:16.440 --> 29:20.280
Congratulations. We've
done an excellent job.

29:20.520 --> 29:25.520
-We'll observe Mewtwo for mutations.
-ls the new tank ready?

29:26.320 --> 29:29.240
We'll have to come up
with a cage for it.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.800
Excellent. We'll start testing.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.600
Is that my purpose?

29:42.440 --> 29:45.080
Am Ijust an experiment?

29:45.520 --> 29:47.840
A laboratory specimen?

29:48.240 --> 29:51.920
This cannot be my destiny!

30:35.320 --> 30:39.280
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

30:42.120 --> 30:44.520
...and we succeeded.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.880
Behold my powers.

31:21.320 --> 31:25.680
l am the strongest Pokémon in the world.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.960
Stronger even than Mew.

31:40.040 --> 31:44.920
Those fools thought you
were a science experiment...

31:45.240 --> 31:49.120
...but l see you as
a valuable partner.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.840
Partner?

31:54.720 --> 31:58.000
With your psychic powers
and my resources...

31:58.240 --> 32:00.920
...together we can control the world.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.720
l do not need your help
for that, human.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.240
A wildfire destroys
everything in its path.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.440
lt will be the same with your
powers unless you control them.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.440
l can help you do that.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.320
How?

32:16.640 --> 32:19.840
l'll show you a way
to focus your powers...

32:20.080 --> 32:22.520
...that will make you invincible.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.440
Show me!

32:52.920 --> 32:56.680
You say this armor protects my body...

32:56.920 --> 32:59.800
...yet it suppresses my powers!

33:00.040 --> 33:04.120
Your powers are not being
suppressed. They're being focused.

33:04.360 --> 33:08.840
Learn to use them to
accomplish your purpose.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.600
What is that?

33:10.840 --> 33:15.320
Patience, my friend. Your
purpose will become clear.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.640
So this is my power.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.240
l am in control now.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.440
Alakazam!

34:14.120 --> 34:16.040
lKazam!

34:39.040 --> 34:42.320
But why am l here?

35:02.320 --> 35:06.080
Now l fully perceive my power.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.880
But what is my purpose?

35:11.120 --> 35:16.080
To serve your master.
You were created to fight for me.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.440
That is your purpose.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.840
That cannot be.

35:21.280 --> 35:26.360
You said we were partners.
We stood as equals.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.520
You were created by humans
to obey humans.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.280
You could never be our equal.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.240
Humans may have created me...

35:36.480 --> 35:39.440
...but they will never enslave me.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.520
This cannot be my destiny!

35:44.200 --> 35:45.680
Stop this now!

35:46.440 --> 35:50.400
l was not born a Pokémon!
l was created.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.520
My creators have used and betrayed me.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.640
So l stand alone.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.120
Who am l?

36:44.880 --> 36:48.880
What is my true reason for being?

36:51.080 --> 36:54.320
l will find my own purpose.

36:54.840 --> 36:59.400
And purge this planet
of all who oppose me.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.480
Human and Pokémon alike.

37:04.200 --> 37:08.400
The world will heed my warning.

37:09.440 --> 37:14.640
The reign of Mewtwo will soon begin.

37:45.880 --> 37:51.520
Today, Ash, Brock and Misty are taking
a break from their Pokémon adventures.

37:52.680 --> 37:57.240
As always, Ash is determined
to become a Pokémon master.

37:57.480 --> 38:02.680
And, as always, he's ready to endure
any hardship, bear any burden...

38:03.120 --> 38:08.320
...with strength, stamina
and a will of steel.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.960
Hungry. Need food.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.480
Oh, Ash! You haven't
done a thing all day!

38:14.760 --> 38:17.280
l'm too weak to work, Misty.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.680
l haven't eaten since breakfast.

38:21.720 --> 38:25.040
This lunch is going to
be just perfect for you.

38:25.560 --> 38:28.480
lt's my lazy-boy ''no-chew'' stew.

38:40.320 --> 38:45.720
You there! l'm looking for a Pokémon
trainer named Ash from Pallet Town.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.560
-You know him?
-Yeah, he's me.

38:49.920 --> 38:54.760
Let's have a match.
Unless you're afraid to lose!

38:55.320 --> 38:58.440
l'm afraid you're going
to lose this one!

38:58.840 --> 39:01.840
Ash, you just said you
were too weak to work!

39:02.120 --> 39:06.360
l am too weak to work, but
a Pokémon battle isn't work!

39:06.600 --> 39:10.320
That's progress. At least
his mouth is working.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.520
I want to be the very best

39:29.040 --> 39:31.800
Like no one ever was

39:33.040 --> 39:36.560
To catch them is my real test

39:36.800 --> 39:40.800
To train them is my cause

39:41.240 --> 39:44.160
I will travel across the land

39:44.400 --> 39:47.280
Searching far and wide

39:48.480 --> 39:52.320
Teach Pokémon to understand

39:52.600 --> 39:54.920
The power that's inside

39:56.800 --> 40:00.000
Inside Pokémon

40:00.560 --> 40:01.880
It's you and me

40:03.200 --> 40:07.200
I know it's my destiny

40:07.720 --> 40:09.880
You're my best friend

40:10.440 --> 40:14.040
And the world we must defend

40:15.840 --> 40:17.880
Our hearts are true

40:19.400 --> 40:22.360
Our courage will pull us through

40:22.600 --> 40:26.720
You teach me and I'll teach you

40:27.000 --> 40:29.040
Pokémon

40:31.120 --> 40:35.520
Got to catch them,
got to catch them all

40:40.400 --> 40:44.400
Great job, Bulbasaur! You did it!

40:47.360 --> 40:50.680
You can challenge along the way

40:50.920 --> 40:54.200
Encourage our faith

40:54.880 --> 40:57.800
I will battle everything

40:58.600 --> 41:02.000
About the place

41:02.800 --> 41:06.320
Come with me, the time is right

41:06.600 --> 41:10.240
There's no better team

41:10.680 --> 41:14.080
Arm in arm we'll win the fight

41:14.320 --> 41:16.600
It's always been our dream

41:22.320 --> 41:24.400
It's you and me

41:25.320 --> 41:27.920
I know it's my destiny

41:29.040 --> 41:31.960
You are my best friend

41:32.200 --> 41:34.520
In a world we must defend

41:38.600 --> 41:40.920
A heart so true

41:41.400 --> 41:44.080
Our courage will pull us through

41:44.680 --> 41:48.080
You teach me and I'll teach you

41:53.040 --> 41:55.200
Got to catch them

41:57.040 --> 41:59.680
Got to catch them all

42:13.920 --> 42:15.800
We did it!

42:17.040 --> 42:19.480
Well, that sure was a shocking ending.

42:19.720 --> 42:23.240
Shocking that Ash moved so fast.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.520
Another credit on Pikachu's
''charge account!''

42:33.760 --> 42:35.480
We've got to grab it!

42:35.840 --> 42:39.000
l know we must grab rare
Pokémon for the Boss...

42:39.240 --> 42:43.920
...but it wouldn't be a bad idea
if we grabbed a bite to eat.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.640
We didn't come here to steal a meal!

42:47.880 --> 42:51.040
l'd settle for a taste
of that Pika-chow.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.080
l'm starving.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.240
l can cook something.

43:00.680 --> 43:05.880
The last time you cooked, you
wiped out eight of my nine lives.

43:41.920 --> 43:47.120
Master, shall l extend an
invitation to these trainers as well?

43:47.840 --> 43:49.920
As you wish.

44:30.160 --> 44:33.040
Watch where you're flying.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.920
Something for me?

44:44.240 --> 44:47.640
Greetings, Pokémon trainers.
I bear an invitation.

44:47.880 --> 44:50.640
She's really small,
but really pretty!

44:50.880 --> 44:56.080
You've been chosen to join a group of
Pokémon trainers at a gathering.

44:56.360 --> 45:01.120
It will be hosted by my master, the
world's greatest Pokémon trainer...

45:01.360 --> 45:03.760
...at his palace on New Island.

45:04.120 --> 45:07.120
A ferry will leave Old Shore Wharf...

45:07.360 --> 45:10.120
...to take you to the island
this afternoon.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.720
Only trainers with this
invitation will be admitted.

45:13.960 --> 45:18.200
If you decide to attend,
you must reply at once.

45:18.440 --> 45:20.560
My master awaits you.

45:25.320 --> 45:28.080
ls there a rewind button?

45:28.320 --> 45:32.480
-Should we go?
-Of course! l've got to meet her!

45:32.720 --> 45:37.920
l guess the world's number-one trainer
wants to challenge me to a match!

45:38.440 --> 45:42.520
-We've got to let him know right away.
-l'm saying yes!

45:55.080 --> 46:00.280
What's so special about
the twerp trio's special delivery?

46:04.120 --> 46:05.440
Hey, look!

46:05.680 --> 46:07.920
''Yes''? To what?

48:11.840 --> 48:13.480
Raticate!

48:16.160 --> 48:17.920
Chill out, Raticate!

48:18.280 --> 48:21.520
lKingler! Save your energy!

48:21.760 --> 48:24.200
This is going to be so cool!

48:24.440 --> 48:27.200
Officer Jenny, report to
the ferry entrance.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.160
Officer Jenny to
the ferry entrance.

48:34.440 --> 48:37.440
Togepi's totally soaked!

48:37.880 --> 48:41.440
l can't believe how
fast the storm came up.

48:46.120 --> 48:49.520
What?! The ferry is canceled?!

48:49.760 --> 48:52.120
But l've got to get to New lsland!

48:53.160 --> 48:57.560
-lt's only a little rain!
-lt's more than just rain.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.040
The harbor manager thinks
this could be the worst storm ever.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.040
Listen to me.

49:03.280 --> 49:07.600
The prophets have predicted
the return of the Winds of Water.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.400
For years...

49:09.640 --> 49:14.840
...l prayed mankind would never
witness that deadly storm ever again.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.280
lsn't that just a legend?

49:17.680 --> 49:22.880
Ancient writings tell of the storm
wiping out all but a few Pokémon.

49:23.240 --> 49:24.680
ln their sorrow...

49:24.920 --> 49:29.720
...the water of their tears restored
the lives lost in the storm.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.560
But there are no Pokémon tears today.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.160
Just waters which no one can survive.

49:36.440 --> 49:39.960
That's why the ferry
has been canceled.

49:40.240 --> 49:45.440
l'm going to New lsland anyway!
All my Pokémon are Water-type!

49:46.000 --> 49:48.400
We'll just swim over to that palace!

49:48.640 --> 49:53.240
l warn you, the waves will
be savage! You will never make it!

49:53.480 --> 49:57.200
lf you try that stunt and
your Pokémon got hurt...

49:57.440 --> 50:01.880
...you'd be out of luck because
we closed the Pokémon Center.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.480
How come?

50:03.720 --> 50:07.640
The nurse in charge of
the center disappeared last month.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.840
lf any of you see her,
please contact me at once.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.440
That's a picture of her
over there on the wall.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.120
She's cute.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.280
She sure looks familiar.

50:44.600 --> 50:48.280
Come back here, or
l'll place you under arrest!

50:52.520 --> 50:53.840
Come back!

50:54.240 --> 50:57.280
Some trainers have no fear.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.360
To them, this is just
one more challenge.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.800
They follow their hearts.

51:04.040 --> 51:09.000
That is what sets them apart
and will make them Pokémon masters.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.160
Good luck to all of you.

51:25.200 --> 51:29.000
The world's greatest Pokémon
master is waiting for me.

51:29.360 --> 51:33.280
Let's use our Pokémon
to get to that island.

51:33.560 --> 51:38.720
Our Pokémon aren't strong enough.
They can't handle waves like this.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.320
Guess you're right.

51:47.360 --> 51:51.120
You vant to cross maybe?
Ve take you?

51:51.360 --> 51:53.720
Ve Vikings are used to big vaves.

51:53.960 --> 51:58.400
Ve get you to New lsland faster
than you can say fahrvergnügen.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.400
Stroke!

52:00.680 --> 52:02.880
Stroke!

52:04.320 --> 52:06.840
Stroke! Stroke!

52:09.120 --> 52:10.800
l think l'm going to have one.

52:11.040 --> 52:16.240
-l didn't know Vikings still existed.
-They mostly live in Minnesota.

52:16.640 --> 52:20.920
Something's not right.
Are you sure this boat's safe?

52:22.040 --> 52:25.720
Don't vorry. This ship
von't let you down.

52:25.960 --> 52:29.880
Ve alvays sail in da
rough veather. Don't get upset.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.240
Tell my stomach.

52:32.760 --> 52:37.000
Heave! Heave! Heave!

52:38.520 --> 52:41.920
lt's all right, Togepi.
We're going to be okay.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.720
-Those aren't Vikings.
-lt's Team Rocket.

53:08.080 --> 53:12.800
l knew there was something fishy
about them besides the smell!

53:13.920 --> 53:17.720
-Prepare for trouble.
-Make it double.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.840
Forget the motto.
We're going to have to....

53:35.960 --> 53:37.960
Ash! Misty!

53:43.400 --> 53:47.160
-Have you seen Ash and Pikachu?
-Not yet.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.960
Stay together. lt's our only hope.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.320
Look!

56:20.600 --> 56:23.600
My master bids you
welcome to New lsland.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.360
lKindly present your invitation.

56:29.040 --> 56:30.480
Here it is, miss.

56:32.880 --> 56:37.120
The bearers of this invitation may
be admitted.

56:38.360 --> 56:41.200
l knew l recognized that face.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.920
What?

56:45.000 --> 56:48.440
Aren't you the nurse
from the treatment center?

56:48.840 --> 56:50.960
You do look just like her.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.920
l fear you are mistaken.

56:53.160 --> 56:58.360
l've always dwelt on this island
and been in the service of my master.

56:58.960 --> 57:01.640
Please, come this way.

57:02.640 --> 57:05.760
My master awaits your arrival.

58:49.520 --> 58:51.680
With you here, all trainers...

58:51.920 --> 58:55.640
...worthy of an audience with
my master are present.

59:03.400 --> 59:05.080
There's only three of them.

59:05.320 --> 59:07.880
Aren't we waiting for the others?

59:08.120 --> 59:11.960
Only the trainers capable
of braving the storm...

59:12.200 --> 59:14.640
...are worthy in my master's eyes.

59:14.920 --> 59:18.320
Do you mean that storm
was some kind of test?

59:18.560 --> 59:23.080
Release your Pokémon from
their Pokéballs and join the others.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.920
lt won't be long before
my master's intentions are clear.

59:39.360 --> 59:43.200
Now we'll never know what
kind of party we're missing!

59:43.440 --> 59:45.840
We'll just have to crash that party.

59:46.080 --> 59:50.120
-You know another way in?
-Look over there.

59:56.080 --> 59:59.760
But how are we going
to swim up that thing?

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.520
Pretend you're a catfish.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.560
-Something wrong, Jessie?
-No. Come on. Let's get going.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.880
l think this plan's all wet.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.480
Psy-ya-ya duck.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.080
What took you guys so long?

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.600
How did you get here?

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.400
l decided to fly over.
lt was easy.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.320
Hurricane winds are
a breeze for Pidgeotto here.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.680
Guys, say hello.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.160
Those are my Pokémon.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.560
lt was no problem
getting through that storm.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.320
l rode over on Gyarados' back.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.320
l heard it takes a lot
of skill to train Gyarados.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.720
Yes, but once you train it, it's
the most dependable Pokémon there is.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.640
You haven't met my
Pokémon. Over there.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.240
You are about to meet my master.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:52.120
The time has come to encounter
the greatest Pokémon master on Earth.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.680
What's that?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.000
Yes. The world's greatest
Pokémon master...

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.640
...is also the most
powerful Pokémon on Earth.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.760
This is the ruler of New lsland
and soon the whole world.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.280
Mewtwo.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.680
Mewtwo.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.440
A Pokémon can't be
a Pokémon master! No way!

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.000
Quiet, human. From now on,
l am the one who makes the rules.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.880
-How's it talking?
-lt's psychic.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.120
We'll show you! Let's go, Gyarados!

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.000
Gyarados, Hyper-Beam attack!

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.960
Gyarados!

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.080
Child's play.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.440
Your usefulness has ended.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.760
Nurse Joy!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.280
Where am l? And how
in the world did l get here?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.320
You have been under my control.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.880
l transported you here
from the Pokémon center.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.400
Your knowledge of Pokémon
physiology proved useful to my plan.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:22.080
l have cleansed your tiny human
brain of memories from the past weeks.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.680
Who are you?!

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.440
l am the new ruler of this world...

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.880
...the master of humans
and Pokémon alike.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.200
You're just a bully!

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.880
Look at these.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.360
They're Pokémon.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.120
Are they real?

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.400
l was hoping there'd be a party.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.200
This is the Pokémon replication
system. System activated.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.920
Pokémon based on genetic analysis.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:58.280
Pokémon DNA sampling
sequence now in progress.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.880
Put me down.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.280
What are you--? Let go!

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.280
-Help!
-Grab him!

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.200
Help me!

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.720
l made it. But just by a hair.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.120
Look, there's your hair.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.080
Analyzing Pokémon biomaterial sample.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.960
Analysis complete.
Pokémon identified.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.480
Begin replication sequence.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.480
-Who's that Pokémon?
-lt's Meowth.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.360
Meowth!

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.800
But l'm Meowth.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.880
-So is the one in the tank.
-Your clone.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.280
I haven't got much time.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.960
I pray this record of
our experiment survives.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.560
A year ago we discovered...

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.680
...the remains of
the ancient Pokémon, Mew.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.359
There was sufficient
genetic material to replicate Mew.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.680
Giovanni insisted on super-clones...

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.920
...more powerful than
any living Pokémon.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.800
Finally our experiments
proved successful.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.240
We produced a living Pokémon.
We called it Mewtwo.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.080
But the creature's anger
is out of control.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.600
With its psychic powers,
it's destroying our laboratory.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.120
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.800
...and we succeeded.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.920
-Sounds like a real Pokénstein.
-Sure does.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.000
One bad cat!

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.479
So this must be the lab.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.279
But if Mewtwo destroyed it....

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.720
-Somebody rebuilt it.
-Yes, but who?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.720
You humans are a dangerous species.

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:24.640
You brought me into your world
with no purpose but to be your slave.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.120
But now l have my own purpose.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:32.439
My storm will create my own world...

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.040
...by destroying yours.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:41.479
So you hate all humans? And you're
going to destroy us to save Pokémon.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.359
No.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.120
Your Pokémon will not be spared.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.479
They have disgraced
themselves by serving humans.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.720
Those Pokémon are nothing but slaves.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.200
So, you say l am wrong?

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.080
You are not this human's servant?
You are his friend?

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.520
You are as pathetic as the rest.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.960
Humans and Pokémon
can never be friends.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.640
Are you okay?

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.600
Don't pick on Pikachu.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.040
lf you are Pokémon, there's
no reason l can't capture you.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.800
Go, Rhyhorn.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.560
-No! Rhyhorn!
-Fools!

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.960
Your Pokémon attacks cannot
weaken me. My powers are too great.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.520
No trainer can conquer me.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.560
You won't mind proving it
in a real match!

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.640
ls that a challenge?

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.360
You bet it is!

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.960
They're awake!

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.760
Blast.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.600
Saur.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.360
-l'm scared.
-Me too.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.520
Like most Pokémon trainers...

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.640
...l too began with Charmander,
Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.800
But for their evolved forms...

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.320
...l used their genetic material
to clone even more powerful copies.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.360
-Copies!
-They're clones.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.440
A stadium! Mewtwo
planned this all along.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.160
Your fake Venusaur
can't beat my real one!

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.920
Right, Bruteroot?

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.640
We'll blow away that Blastoise,
won't we Shellshocker?!

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.400
lt may not have a nickname,
but l do have a Charizard.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.760
l choose you!

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.880
Charizard, l didn't say start.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.520
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.800
Which of you will oppose me first?

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.440
Saur.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.400
l underestimated you last time,
but that won't happen again!

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.560
Go, Bruteroot! Razor Leaf!

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.440
Vine Whip.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.240
Bruteroot!

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.480
lt looks like l'm up.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.400
Go, Shellshocker!

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.200
Blastoise.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760
Blast.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.920
Shellshocker, Hydro Pump!

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.320
Shellshocker!

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.840
You better forfeit, Ash.
Those clones are too powerful.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.360
l'm not giving up.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.000
Charizard, use your speed,
not power, and you'll win.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.080
All right, go!

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.600
-Can't Charizard move any quicker?
-The clone is too fast.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.280
-Charizard's in trouble!
-Finish it.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.280
No, Charizard! No!
Are you okay?

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.200
As the victor, l now claim my prize:

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.200
Your Pokémon.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.280
Wait!

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.080
What will you do with those Pokémon?!

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.640
l will extract their DNA
to make clones for myself.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.720
They will remain safe
on this island...

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.560
...while my storm destroys the planet.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.160
You can't do this!

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.080
Yes, Mewtwo! We won't let you!

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.760
Do not attempt to defy me.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.840
This is my world now.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.920
Let's go!

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.440
Gyarados!

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.560
l know!

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.000
Mewtwo can't catch them
if they're inside their Pokéballs.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.680
Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.560
lt's no use.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.960
lt's futile to try
and escape my power.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.080
Never mind the Pokéballs.
Carry them away!

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.360
Give back my Psyduck!

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.320
Vulpix!

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.080
Run, Pikachu!

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.600
lKeep running, Pikachu!

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.000
You're not going to get Pikachu!

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.200
There goes Alakazam.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.160
Dewgong.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.120
Vileplume.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.360
Sandshrew. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.120
But me, l got a special
place in my tail for this one.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.080
Look there!

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.480
l don't have time for
your dumb motto today.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:13.160
Who's that Pokémon? lt's Pikachu!

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.480
Let go! Stupid machine.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.080
Give me back my Pikachu!

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.720
What's happening?

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.520
l'm so glad you're okay.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.280
The copies are hatching!

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.480
-They're fabulous fakes!
-Send in the clones!

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.680
But where are the real ones?

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.360
-l wonder if they feel....
-Clonesome?

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.360
The Poké originals!

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.600
Squirtle's back!

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.200
You're all okay!

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.840
Humans, you have served my purpose.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.320
l am sparing your lives,
for the moment.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.440
But you cannot escape your fate.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:17.880
The hour of my vengeance draws near.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.520
Behold!

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.360
With Pokémon and humans eliminated...

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.320
...the clones shall inherit the world.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.920
You can't do this. l won't let you.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.520
-lt's Ash!
-All right!

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.080
-Psyduck!
-Vulpix!

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.360
lt is useless to challenge me.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:21.120
lt's not going to end like this,
Mewtwo. We won't let it.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.720
You're mine!

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.560
-Ash, no!
-Look out!

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.480
What?

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.480
Can it be?

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.800
-What is that?
-l don't know.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.600
Mew. So finally we meet.

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.280
l may have been
cloned from your DNA...

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.760
...but l will prove that Mewtwo
is better than the original.

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.200
Superior to Mew.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.320
Mew and Mewtwo!

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.720
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.160
This world is too small for two of us.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.880
Why do you flee from me?

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.480
Are you afraid to
find out which of us is greater?

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.240
So you do have some fight in you.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:18.200
But l have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.880
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:28.200
Or your pathetic group
of spineless inferior Pokémon?

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.120
We were created with powers
far stronger than the originals.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.160
-Mew's got a good point.
-What's it saying?

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.360
You don't prove anything by
showing off a lot of special powers.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.120
And that a Pokémon's
real strength comes from the heart.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:00.520
My clones don't need
their powers to prove their worth.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.960
l will block all the Pokémon's
special abilities...

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.200
...using my psychic powers.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:24.080
Now we shall see who triumphs. Go!

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:37.080
Pokémon aren't meant to fight.
Not like this.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.120
lt's useless.
What can come out of it?

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.560
Nothing but pain.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:51.080
Can't Mewtwo understand it's
not right to force Pokémon to battle?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.920
They're all living creatures.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.920
This just proves
that fighting is wrong.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.240
l was prepared for trouble,
but not for this.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.600
Make that double for me.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.440
Now l can see how
horrible fighting really is.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.760
Even the best of friends
will fight sometimes.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.760
l'll promise never to
fight again if you will.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.760
What am l doing?

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.880
Let's get something straight!

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.680
You-owth ain't pushing Meowth around.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.120
You mean, we don't have
to fight with each other?

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.600
But how can l trust you?
You was born different.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.280
l almost made a clawful mistake.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.640
How do l know you're not
going to pull a fast one on me?

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.880
You're right, we
do have a lot in common.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:18.320
The same earth, the
same air, the same sky.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.480
Maybe if we started
looking at what's the same...

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.160
...instead of always looking at
what's different, who knows?

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.320
Quit it! Please, stop!

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.600
Are you okay?

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.480
We got to stop this.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.680
How? Mewtwo wants to prove
how strong those super-clones are.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.960
l'd rather risk my life
out in Mewtwo's storm...

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.280
...than watch Pokémon
destroy each other.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.280
Me too.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.160
l wish there were some way to
stop them. l don't know what to do.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:52.120
l don't think they'll ever stop.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.160
Those Pokémon are ready
to fight to the death.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.960
That's a fight that
nobody's going to win.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.280
Someone's got to take a stand.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.200
Someone's got to say no
and refuse to fight.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:11.200
Just like Pikachu.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.640
Ash, wait!

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.160
You've got to stop right now!

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.880
Stop!!

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:39.880
Oh, no!

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.560
Fool, trying to stop our battle.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.920
Please, no!

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.520
The human sacrificed
himself to save the Pokémon.

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.000
l pitted them against each other.

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.800
Only when they set aside
their differences...

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.600
...did l see the true power
they all share deep inside.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.760
l see now that the circumstances
of one's birth are irrelevant.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.840
lt is what you do with
the gift of life...

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:22.040
...that determines who you are.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.800
Mewtwo, where are you going?

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.160
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.120
What transpired here,
l will always remember.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.280
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.760
-This could be the worst storm ever.
-You must listen to me.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.120
You have got to find shelter.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.320
Excuse me, please.

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.240
The Pokémon Treatment Center
will open as a shelter.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.640
Anyone who needs a place
to stay should come with me.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:20.960
Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny
are really great.

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.560
They keep getting more beautiful
every time l see them.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.640
Guys, how did we wind up
in this place anyway?

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:34.200
Well, l guess we're
just here because we're here.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.040
Yes, let's eat.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.640
Look, it's a miracle!

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.800
l can't believe it.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.120
-The storm disappeared.
-That's so weird!

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.360
lt's good to have things clear again.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.320
What's that?

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.200
What's what?

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.040
-l don't see anything, Ash.
-Except the sky.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.960
The day l started
my Pokémon journey...

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.760
...l saw a really rare Pokémon.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.600
And just now, l thought
l saw another one.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.800
Maybe you're just seeing things, Ash.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.800
Maybe he's not.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.720
Maybe we'll see.

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.200
Many strange legends
surround the mysteries of Pokémon.

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.840
Just as many adventures
await our heroes...

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.560
...as they continue on their quest.

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:12.880
For Ash and his friends,
the journey's just begun.

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.200
l don't know how we
got here, but who cares?

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.480
-This is paradise!
-For once, a happy ending.

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.920
Team Rocket's signing off again!

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.880
Have any unscreen?

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.240
I'd really like to go sailing
in one of them catamarans.

01:49:42.305 --> 01:49:48.545
