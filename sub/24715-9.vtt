Hey, Michael,

00:04.087 --> 00:06.464
-you’re supposed to be in school.
-I’m just cuttin’ this one day.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.842
Ah, we'll talk about this later,
all right. My car’s outside.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.135
I'll meet you there in a second.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.053
Your dad’s coming, too.
We’re all gonna have a conversation.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.139
I took a day off, man.
What’s the big deal?

00:14.222 --> 00:15.598
What you did today was wrong, Michael.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.893
-You don’t want me around my dad.
-I just don’t want you to start slippin’.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.229
Michael knows what’s up.
He know what you’re about.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.523
You’re damn right he does.
I’m on his side.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.860
Nah, he knows the only reason
you been kissin’ his ass

00:26.943 --> 00:29.404
is to try to get him to lie
and say I killed his mother.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.198
That sounds more like
what you’ve been puttin’ into his head.

-Sorry, I totally lost track of the time.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.859
So the concert is over with,
in other words?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.402
The recital’s actually tonight,

01:09.486 --> 01:11.654
which is why I’m in this frantic
practice mode.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.574
-You just move in here?
-Yeah, I’m subletting.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.659
Well, just to let you know,
I need my sleep.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.329
You gonna practice your clarinet,
you do it during the day.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.955
I... I understand.
I... I’m putting it away.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.000
-(SIGHS)
-It’s a bassoon.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.045
Excuse me?

01:27.128 --> 01:29.089
The... the instrument I play
is the bassoon.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.758
(SCOFFS) Thanks for clearing that up.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.472

-(GROANS) Idiot next door.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.188
It’s okay, though. Go back to sleep.

(EXHALES) A bassoon player.

Couldn’t have been someone
who works for an airline moves in,

01:53.238 --> 01:55.031
could maybe do us some good.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.617
(GRUNTS) Nothing wrong with having

01:57.700 --> 02:00.036
a little... (INHALES)

02:00.120 --> 02:03.623

roughed up the husband,

02:37.740 --> 02:39.826
made off with a bunch of stuff,
she didn't say what.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.703
-Where’s the husband?
-Took him to St. Vincent’s

02:41.786 --> 02:43.705
with chest pains.
He’s retired off the job.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.081
Name’s Roy Shaughnessy.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.668
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO)

02:51.629 --> 02:54.340
I’m Detective Sipowicz.
This is Detective Clark.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.135
I worked with your husband at the 2-0.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.470
(EXHALES) I’d like to go to the hospital
and be with him.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.181
ANDY: We’ll have someone
run you over there.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.849
We just need you to tell us what happened.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.643
We were in bed, asleep.
I heard Oliver barking.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.812
Roy went into the living room
to see what it was

03:07.937 --> 03:09.564
and the next thing I know, I hear yelling.

03:09.772 --> 03:14.485
I come in here, and I see,
a guy with a knife to Roy’s throat

03:14.903 --> 03:17.030
and the other guy tying him to the chair.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.324
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-What do you remember about them?

03:19.741 --> 03:24.495
They wore masks. Uh... (INHALES DEEPLY)
...probably in their twenties,

03:24.621 --> 03:26.456
white or Spanish, I’m not sure which.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.626
One of them, I think,
had, like, an army jacket on.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.002
What’d they do when they saw you?

03:31.169 --> 03:33.421
The one with the knife
grabbed me by the hair.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.548
I said, "Take anything you want."

03:36.216 --> 03:39.761
He, uh, pushed me back into the bedroom,
dumped out the dresser.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.137
He said he wanted the guns.

03:41.471 --> 03:45.391
I told him we had no guns,
and, uh, that’s when I got this.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.686
I gave him about 1,000 dollars in cash,

03:49.270 --> 03:52.774
a necklace that was my mother’s...
(SNIFFLES) ...my wedding ring.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.153
(SIGHS) A signed letter
that General Patton had written

03:57.237 --> 04:00.490
that I bought Roy off the internet
and two of his guns.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.245
(SOBS) All replaceable, I guess.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.040
Yeah. You both handled this
as well as you could.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.835
(EXHALES) It’d be good if you mentioned
that to Roy, when you see him.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.546
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Well,
we’ll have somebody take you

04:15.672 --> 04:17.423
-to the hospital now.
-JACKIE: Thanks.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.595
-What kind of guy was he on the job?
-Stand-up, tough.

04:22.845 --> 04:26.182
It’s definitely gonna be more
about the pride than the money.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.060
Uh... these old-timers.
Now I know why they move to Florida.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.273
Old-timers?
I was in the academy with this guy.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.735
All-timers. I said "All-timers,"
as in "All-time great cops."

-Oh, right.

06:08.826 --> 06:12.622
Hi, nice to meet you.
I’m kind of in a hurry right now.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.082
I just wanted to say I was sorry

06:14.207 --> 06:16.334
for practicing so late last night
and waking you guys up.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.212
And I see that you’re a police officer.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.090
I sure am. And you didn’t wake me up.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.717
-I guess that was your...
-Husband.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.553
Ah... Well, uh, to make up for it,

06:27.720 --> 06:31.140
I wanted to leave, uh, two tickets
to tonight’s recital.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.434
-Oh, you don’t have to do that.
-It's my pleasure,

06:33.559 --> 06:34.852
I don’t know if you like classical music,

06:34.936 --> 06:37.397
but we’re performing
one of Vivaldi’s lesser known works,

06:37.605 --> 06:39.399
And it’s a really terrific
chamber ensemble.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
Well, thank you.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.861
It’s a concerto in F major, 571,
in case you’re wondering.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.489
-Oh, I’m not familiar.
-That’s why it’s lesser-known.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.034
(INHALES) Anyway, Lawrence Tempra Hall,
eight o'clock.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.913
-It says on the ticket.
-Oh, right. Well, I hope you can make it.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.666
-You and your husband, of course.
-CONNIE: Okay, thanks.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.598
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-I heard the alarm go off,

07:12.723 --> 07:15.268
and by the time I realized that
it was my car,

07:15.476 --> 07:16.936
it was already in flames.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.938
All right, the fire marshal says
it was definitely Arson.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.107
-(SCOFFS)
-Any idea who’d wanna torch it?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.775
-None.
-No enemies?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.735
-No!
-People don’t usually set fire

07:24.819 --> 07:27.363
-to cars on a random basis.
-Well, you’re the experts.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.033
We’d like you to come into
the 15th precinct, Mr. Tytell.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.996
We need to ask you some questions.
It’s best not to do it out here in public.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.873
Okay, I totally understand that.
Let me take care

07:37.165 --> 07:38.166

<i>"Only Schmucks Pay Income Tax."</i>

07:54.390 --> 07:55.391
Huh.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.318
I didn’t wanna go to this place,
but I think I have to. I have to consider

08:05.401 --> 08:08.529
that my ex-wife
might have had something to do with this.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.406
Has she ever done anything violent
in the past?

08:10.698 --> 08:12.325
Overtly violent, no, but,

08:12.408 --> 08:15.745
there’s a lot of bitterness, resentment.
As I’ve become more successful,

08:15.828 --> 08:17.246
I think it's fair to say
it’s gotten worse.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.999
-Any threats?
-No overt threats.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.377
-Anything else you can think of?
-I’ve been racking my brain.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.796
Carolyn’s the only one
who makes any sense at all.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.842
-So, your book?
-Why, you skeptical?

08:30.009 --> 08:33.221
Well, I... I just don’t get why millions
of people pay taxes,

08:33.304 --> 08:35.973
-when they don’t have to.
-BARRY: They are misinformed.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.392
-Oh.
-The government, through the tax code,

08:38.476 --> 08:41.103
deceives us into thinking
income taxes are mandatory.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.688
In fact, they’re strictly voluntary.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.398
In other words, you don’t have to pay
if you don’t want to.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.735
-That is exactly right.
-What happens then?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.112
-You get to chapter nine?
-No.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.822
In chapter nine,
I take you through the consequences

08:51.906 --> 08:52.907
on how to deal with them,

08:53.032 --> 08:55.952
including the "Voluntary nature
of the audit."

08:56.118 --> 08:59.205
-(CHUCKLES) The whole thing.
-I... I... I just keep coming back to

08:59.330 --> 09:00.915
why this hasn’t seen the light of day?

09:01.082 --> 09:04.710
BARRY: The most important function
of government is the propagation of myth.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.588
Income taxes are strictly voluntary
and that’s the law.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.800
Yeah, uh, you should tell us
where we could find your ex-wife.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.594
Yeah. She works at Bed &amp; Bath Works,
Second Avenue.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.014
I can’t tell you how much I hope
she is not responsible.

09:17.223 --> 09:21.143
-Well, we’ll let you know.
-BARRY: (SIGHS) Thanks.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.366
-Hey, Ken, how you doin’?
-I need to talk to you.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.451
Yeah, sure.

09:39.996 --> 09:45.251
-So, a pretty interesting concept, huh?
-Very interesting and very absurd.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.296
Well, that’s your opinion.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.009
I know you’ve been pretty involved
with Michael’s situation.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.510
What’s goin’ on?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.055
I’m sending Michael back
to social services.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.183
-Why?
-He’s a good kid.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.980
-Just not equipped.
-BALDWIN: For what? what did he do?

10:06.397 --> 10:09.317
Michael’s father showed up,
a bunch of times.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.277
In the morning,
before Michael left for school,

10:11.444 --> 10:15.406
around supper time.
We have two other kids. We can’t do it.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.619
-Has Michael’s father threatened you?
-This just isn’t a good situation for us.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.204
If he’s made any threats,
we can do something about it.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.291
-No threats.
-But he’s intimidated you.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.586
We’re not comfortable.
My wife doesn’t feel safe.

10:29.003 --> 10:33.132
I’ll talk to Michael’s father.
Believe me, I’ll work it out.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.885
We’re done. I’m sorry.

10:36.677 --> 10:40.014
My wife and I are both pretty torn up
having to do this.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.725
She couldn’t even bring herself
to come down here.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.852
BALDWIN: Okay.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.315
I told her you’d find someplace else
for him.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.361
Maybe someplace
his father doesn’t know about.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.779
Yeah.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.035
-ANDY: No pattern to the home invasion.
-TONY: What about his gun?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.954
25-caliber Beretta and A colt .357.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.581
Make sure the alarms transmitted
on the guns.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.042
-That’s done, boss.
-Let it be known on the street

11:08.167 --> 11:10.127
there’s buy money for whatever else
they might be trying to get rid of.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.046
We’ll confirm what was stolen
with Shaughnessy

11:12.213 --> 11:14.757
-as soon as we talk to him.
-You haven’t done that yet?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.134
They had him under observation
on account of his heart,

11:17.218 --> 11:20.596
-but I think he’s all right.
-Or It might be something you wanna know.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.475
Okay, well, how about the last we heard
he was all right?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.477
He should be on his way in, Lieu.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.895
Yeah, good.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.736
He’s a little raggy, huh?

11:36.153 --> 11:39.281
Andy, any interest in going
to a concert tonight?

11:39.448 --> 11:43.077
-Is that a trick question?
-The guy next door gave me two tickets.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.664
The fruit that woke me up?
How come he gave them to you?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.290
I was the only one home.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.835
-Oh.
-It’s chamber music.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.129
-Which means what?
-It's like classical.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.716
Did you hear him playin’ this morning?
It sounded like somebody beatin’ a moose.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.300
So, going to this wouldn’t be anything
you’d like to try?

11:58.467 --> 12:00.553
Hey, It’s gonna be hell gettin’ a sitter.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.596
I mean, if you’re dyin’ to go
to this thing...

12:02.763 --> 12:05.474

It’s no big deal.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.822
Any help I can be, obviously.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.074
This is my partner, John Clark.
Roy Shaughnessy.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.784
JOHN: Hi, Roy. Nice to meet you.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.494
-Have a seat.
-Yeah.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.706
You, uh, get the serial number
of the guns?

12:28.789 --> 12:30.124
-Yeah.
-(ROY CLEARS THROAT)

12:30.708 --> 12:35.171
Well, the wedding ring’s a gold band
with our initials engraved on the inside.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.673
The necklace has got
some kind of green jewels on it

12:37.840 --> 12:38.966
with, uh, little, tiny diamonds.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.510
What about that, uh,
letter signed by Patton?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.638
Yeah, he, uh, wrote it to the widow
of a tank commander

12:44.722 --> 12:45.848
killed in North Africa.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.350
It’s worth about 1,500 dollars,
if you know what it is.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.144
Since they took it,
they’re probably gonna fence it.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.229
Not many places
will fence that kind of thing,

12:52.313 --> 12:54.982
So it’s a good place to start.
We got a couple of guys to talk to.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.066
Good.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.696
-Could have been worse, Roy.
-Well, absolutely. (SCOFFS)

13:00.946 --> 13:02.323
My wife could have been violated.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.158
She could have been hurt
a lot worse than she was.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.535
We’re checking on cases
with similar MOs in the area.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.455
We’ll also have some photos
of known burglars.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.332
Maybe one of ’em may ring a bell.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.543
Good, yeah. I appreciate the effort, guys.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.546
Roy, I know you probably wanna handle
this yourself.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.466
No, no, no. Those days are gone.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.635
Jackie and me,
we’re talkin’ about movin’ to Florida.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.929
-Yeah.
-ROY: When are you gettin’ out, Andy?

13:25.012 --> 13:28.265
-Not any time soon.
-It’s all changed so much, though.

13:28.474 --> 13:32.895
Look who they let on the job.
No offense, but in our days,

13:33.020 --> 13:35.940
most guys had military backgrounds,
families.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.942
We looked at the job as a step up

13:38.025 --> 13:40.820
as opposed to just a paycheck
and benefits.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.781
-I admire you for hangin’ in there.
-Yeah.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.408
Come on, Roy, I’ll get you set up
with those mug books.

14:05.469 --> 14:09.139
-That little prick Barry sent you to me?
-Well, he didn’t make any accusations.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.475
-We just have to talk to you, that’s all.
-Yeah, right.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.020
He... he said, "He couldn’t imagine you
doing anything along these lines,

14:15.187 --> 14:17.857
"but since the acrimony of the divorce..."
(EXHALES)

14:17.940 --> 14:22.278
-Was there someone he could imagine?
-Uh, no one else that came to mind.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.655
Tell him to think a little harder,
the big brain.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.532
Well, is there someone you’re aware of?

14:26.740 --> 14:29.743
I’m not pointing any fingers.
I’m just gonna tell you

14:29.952 --> 14:32.538
that there’s people he’s burned
and plenty of ’em.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.748
-Well, how’d he burn them?
-(SIGHS)

14:34.832 --> 14:38.502
Look, all I know
is he got cursed out in restaurants,

14:38.627 --> 14:42.256
and we had to change our phone number,
because of late-night hang-up calls.

14:42.423 --> 14:47.303
-This is in response to... his tax book?
-Not so much the book.

14:47.469 --> 14:52.224
It’s more the body slam,
these poor idiots got from the IRS

14:52.349 --> 14:55.686
after they filed their "Screw you,
Uncle Sam" return.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.271
So, his system doesn’t work?

14:57.396 --> 15:00.149
Something wasn’t working
for some of these people,

15:00.232 --> 15:01.942
’cause they were very pissed off.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.905
Because your ex-husband’s
system was flawed

15:05.988 --> 15:09.074
or they didn’t follow Instructions?
Because he’s very specific...

15:09.158 --> 15:11.785
Uh... where were you around seven o'clock
this morning, Carolyn?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.203
Doing quarterly inventory.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.080
We need to confirm that with your manager.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.790
Fine, be my guest.

15:17.333 --> 15:21.253
I set fire to Barry’s car,
he’s gonna be in it.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.598
Gents.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.560
We’re lookin’ for some old stuff,
maybe World War II era.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.938
Don’t have that, but if I know people,
and I do,

15:39.021 --> 15:41.148
this guy right here is a Springsteen fan.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.733
-Am I right?
-How’d you guess?

15:42.816 --> 15:45.194
I got a jacket from the ’84 tour 1,500.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.656
-Yeah, that’s a little steep.
-Van Halen, you got to like Van Halen.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.241
One of Michael Anthony’s basses,
signed by the band.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.409
I can let you have it for 1,000.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.537
So you only deal
with rock and roll memorabilia?

15:55.871 --> 16:00.084
You... don’t say it ’cause I know.
Major Frankie Valli fan, right?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.377
(CHUCKLES)

16:01.543 --> 16:04.588
(CLEARS THROAT) We’re lookin’
for something non-music-related.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.507
Cole Porter, Benny Goodman? Talk to me.

16:06.590 --> 16:10.135
How about a letter from George Patton
to the widow of a Tank Commander?

16:10.427 --> 16:11.845
Can’t help you.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.431
You got a bill of sale
for that Springsteen jacket?

16:14.515 --> 16:15.599
What kind of question is that?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.643
The kind that comes
with a set of handcuffs attached.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.311
-Where is this comin’ from?
-JOHN: People tell us,

16:19.395 --> 16:21.939
you’re the man to see
for stolen memorabilia.

16:22.773 --> 16:26.110
-That’s way in the past.
-Hey, this is a police investigation.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.904
That means if any of this crap
in here is stolen,

16:29.071 --> 16:31.240
we padlock the store
and you’re under arrest.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.866
I run a legitimate business now.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.493
Wanna keep runnin’ it,
better beat the bushes.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.080
Get the word out, come up with some info
on that letter by the end of the day.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.583
-Got it.
-And Cole Porter was 20 years

16:41.875 --> 16:43.669
before my time, pal.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.840
(SCOFFS) Cole Porter.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.141
I’m shooting for a million in sales
this year.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.268
An... and that’s just from
<i>Only Schmucks Pay Taxes?</i>

16:59.435 --> 17:02.312
No, I carry a number of titles.
<i>The Myth Of Compulsory Education,</i>

17:02.396 --> 17:04.815
<i>How To Beat A Drunk-Driving</i>
<i>Charge Without Paying A Lawyer,</i>

17:04.898 --> 17:06.442
<i>Play The Piano Without Reading Music.</i>

17:06.525 --> 17:08.819
Your ex-wife seems to think
you have some enemies from your business.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.488
-(SCOFFS) It is so like her to say that.
-It’s not true?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.781
BARRY: Enemies? No.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.867
There have been business disputes
with people come in here

17:14.992 --> 17:16.869
with unreasonable expectations
and been disappointed?

17:16.952 --> 17:19.747
I won’t say that’s never happened,
but no one I call an enemy.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.749
When you say "Disappointed,"
you mean like, uh,

17:21.832 --> 17:23.876
someone didn’t beat drunk-driving charges,

17:23.959 --> 17:25.502
or they didn’t learn,
how to play the piano

17:25.586 --> 17:28.005
-without reading music?
-or got popped for not paying their taxes?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.758
BARRY: No one who has followed my advice,
I mean, followed to the letter,

17:30.966 --> 17:32.885
has wound up owing the government a dime.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.180
Yeah, I... I have to tell you,
I still can’t understand how that can be.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.849
You understand how the Fifth Amendment
protects us against self-incrimination?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.976
-Right.
-Well, tax returns, therefore,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.978
have to be voluntary by nature.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.105
GREG: The law says,
"You have to file a tax return."

17:45.272 --> 17:46.273
How's that voluntary?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.192
The law says you "must" file a tax return.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.318
What’s the difference?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.946
Because, in the law,
"must" actually means "may."

17:53.322 --> 17:55.824
You’re allowed to pay taxes.
You’re not required to pay taxes.

17:56.283 --> 18:00.954
(SCOFFS) I can’t believe it.
All these years I’ve been payin’ taxes.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.208
-Everyone I know has been payin’ taxes.
-BARRY: How about if we do this?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.668
I prepare your return personally.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.797
I use the language
that provides ironclad protection

18:09.880 --> 18:13.342
against the IRS prosecuting.
You pay zero dollars in taxes

18:13.425 --> 18:16.637
and absolutely nothing will happen to you.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.765
-How much?
-BARRY: Gratis.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.934
Wanna show your appreciation?
Tell your friends.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.562
It doesn’t look your ex-wife had anything
to do with settin’ your car on fire.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.856
(SIGHS) Well, to tell you the truth,
I’m glad to hear it.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
I put in for the insurance claim.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.068
I’d just assumed it was an act
of random urban violence.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.486
All right, well that doesn't
put it to bed.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.446
We’ll need, uh, names of anybody
you had a beef with.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.156
I honestly can’t think of a soul.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.201
Keep thinkin’. Hey, Greg?
I got to make a stop, okay?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.994
-GREG: Yeah.
-BARRY: Here, detective.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.372
<i>Buy An Apartment Building</i>
<i>At A Government Auction.</i>

18:53.173 --> 18:54.716
The guy’s name is J.J.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.261
-And where do we find him?
-That I can’t tell you.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.304
-So, just J.J.?
-Right.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.640
Yeah, we ought to be able to pin him down
real good with that.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.392
I don't think we need anything else.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.186
What do you want from me?
I put out the word to my colleagues

19:06.270 --> 19:08.730
that I needed this, uh,
Patton letter if it turns up.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.567
Half-hour later,
an anonymous middleman comes in,

19:11.817 --> 19:14.153
says, uh, his contact bought it off
a guy named J.J.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.404
for 100 bucks.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.323
That’s all he knew.
I paid the 100 and I come right down here.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.160
And you figured what,
that would be the end of it?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.870
Actually, I was thinkin’
I might hear somethin’

19:22.953 --> 19:25.289
along the lines of "Thank you,
Mr. Oppoulito.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.207
"Now, let’s get you reimbursed."

19:27.291 --> 19:29.793
A guy comes in off the street
you never seen before?

19:30.210 --> 19:32.004
That’s why I wanted to deal
with someone in authority.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.382
We need you to identify
which colleague you got it from.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.844
I don’t know, but you might start runnin’
with this J.J., all right?

19:39.094 --> 19:41.013
-More than that, I don’t know.
-All right, we have him

19:41.096 --> 19:42.806
for receiving stolen property?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.350
Lock him up and turn him over to the DA
as noncooperative.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.103
I brought in the fricken letter,
how am I noncooperative?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.105
-Stand up.
-If I knew, you were gonna break out

19:50.189 --> 19:51.773
the dump screws,
I never would have come in.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.443
Yeah, run the nickname J.J.
see if you get any prints off the letter.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.162
-(DOOR KNOCKING)
-What?

20:05.662 --> 20:07.247
Dropping off the case folders
you asked me for.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.249
On the desk. (EXHALES)

20:16.131 --> 20:19.134
Rita... Close the door.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.600
(INHALES DEEPLY) I’m off the list
for Captain’s money.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.936
-You’re kidding.
-A little payback for the trial.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.022
-Internal affairs?
-This comes from higher up.

20:32.105 --> 20:36.109
-Police commissioner’s office, probably.
-I’m really sorry.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.197
Eddie Gibson, he got promoted to sergeant.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.949
Well, now you know it’s just a joke.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.617
-My career, you mean?
-Boss.

20:43.867 --> 20:47.537
I’ve hit the wall.
This is as far as I’ll go on the job.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.707
-Give ’em a year.
-I’ve already given ’em 18.

20:52.125 --> 20:57.631
But, hey, that’s my problem.
Thanks for listening.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.732
All right, folks,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.651
Three guesses what this brother
does for a livin’.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.236
-Let’s take a walk, Craig.
-Nope.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.821
-I ain’t askin’.
-Where we goin'?

21:20.904 --> 21:24.324
-In the back. Come on.
-I ain’t that kind of guy, Chief.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.744
So you got Michael kicked out
of his foster home.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.413
This is what you wanted, I'm asking.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.873
Sorry to hear that,
but he didn’t like ’em much anyway.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.083
He liked ’em fine.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.918
You haven't figured out yet,
that he tells you one thing

21:35.085 --> 21:37.045
and everybody else another.
Thought you were supposed

21:37.212 --> 21:39.131
-to have a trained mind.
-for picking up on that kind of thing.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.800
-Why you messin’ up Michael’s life?
-I could ask you the same thing.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.635
Helpin’ him out, gettin’ him
a place to live? That's messing with him?

21:43.844 --> 21:46.763
I'm talking about you tryin’ to turn him
into a white boy like yourself.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.349
Go ahead, white boy.

21:50.225 --> 21:54.062
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

21:56.356 --> 21:57.441
That’s what you want.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.571
That’s how you think you’ll get rid of me.

22:05.282 --> 22:09.411
Assault charge.
Sue the department. Sue me.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.371
I’m just here havin’ a cocktail.

22:13.665 --> 22:17.169
Enjoy it. I’ll see you around.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.363
-It’s definitely Carolyn.
-This the, uh, poisonous variety?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.949
-A blue krait? Oh, yeah.
-How tough are they to come by?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.952
Not tough, if you’re workin’
as a choke setter in Sri Lanka.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.662
When was the last time
Carolyn contacted you?

22:52.788 --> 22:54.915
I saw her a couple of weeks ago,
in the store where she works.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.209
-You went to see her?
-Yeah. I needed bath towels.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.252
I don’t see, why I should be foreclosed
from a bargain

22:59.336 --> 23:00.837
just ’cause she works at that store.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.298
-We’re good here.
-All right, thanks.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.805
Just keep it away.
She knows I’m deathly afraid of snakes.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.808
Yeah. We’ll, uh,
try and lift some prints off the box,

23:12.891 --> 23:14.559
though I doubt
if we can get anything useful.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.729
(EXHALES) By the way,
I’m preparing my standard return for you.

23:17.854 --> 23:21.525
All I need is the correct spelling
of your last name, your earning statement

23:21.650 --> 23:22.818
and zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.738
-Uh, I’d love to believe that...
-Now, listen to me,

23:26.947 --> 23:28.740
you submit the return
exactly as I’ve prepared it.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.242
The government will not come after you.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.868
They will not take on
a challenge to their authority.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.620
You owe them nothing.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.581
-Come on, let’s go, Greg.
-Yeah.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.461
-Nothing.
-M-E-D-A-V-O-Y.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.681
BALDWIN: Goin’ back at the ex-wife’s
a waste of time.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.392
I don’t understand,
why you’re so dug in, Baldwin.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.145
Her alibi held the first time,
there’s no history of harassment.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.771
And the only reason
why you wannna believe this huckster

23:59.855 --> 24:01.690
is 'cause you think he’s gonna save you
money on your taxes.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.651
You... you...
you get your mind made up, that’s it.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.280
Yeah, the guy’s running a scam
with the taxes. Case closed.

24:08.488 --> 24:12.492
New information doesn’t matter.
An embittered ex-spouse doesn’t matter.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.872
That the guy makes a reasoned argument
that maybe taxes are voluntary,

24:17.164 --> 24:19.499
-that doesn’t matter.
-This fax came for you.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.210
-BALDWIN: Thanks, John.
-What’s that?

24:22.752 --> 24:25.130
It’s parking citation,
where his car got burned.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.633
You’ll rummage through parking tickets
before you’ll take a man at his word.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.011
-Yep.
-So, Sherlock?

24:31.261 --> 24:34.556
Oh, a van with commercial plates
got a ticket for being double-parked.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.102
Oh, great. That’s more promising
than an ex-wife who knows

24:39.186 --> 24:40.979
that he’s squeamish about reptiles.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.608
A van with commercial plates
registered to a pet store.

24:57.412 --> 25:01.166
Hey, uh, Andy, latent prints got a hit
from that frame the Patton letter was in,

25:01.458 --> 25:04.836
comes back to that J.J.
Do you know that guy?

25:06.546 --> 25:09.090
-No.
-Why don’t you head on home, Roy?

25:09.174 --> 25:10.592
-We’ll keep you updated.
-(EXHALES DEEPLY)

25:10.675 --> 25:13.136
I must have said that to 2,000 people,
when I was on the job.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.680
Never understood how frustrating it was
to hear until now.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.226
-You know this is our top priority.
-Yeah, keep me updated.

25:21.811 --> 25:26.274
-(EXHALES) What got him off the job?
-Disability. I think he had 22 years.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.401
-Legit claim?
-Yeah, he fell through the floor

25:28.485 --> 25:30.111
of an abandoned building,
chasing a junkie.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.947
Even with the time that he had in, uh,

25:32.030 --> 25:34.115
he was one of those guys
who wasn’t ready for retirement.

25:34.282 --> 25:38.119
Well, it sure caught my dad flat-footed
when he put in his papers.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.248
-So, we got a place to look for this J.J.?
-Yeah.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.333
-Let’s run it for the boss.
-Good.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.763
Thanks.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.810
So, uh, they gonna try and find
another foster family for Michael?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.896
-Well, Michael’s aunt is taking him in.
-Where’s she been up till now?

26:05.105 --> 26:07.065
Scared to death of Michael’s dad.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.818
Having her sister get killed,
I guess you can’t blame her.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.236
Yeah.

26:15.991 --> 26:20.203
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, uh, Detectives Medavoy and Jones.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.539
Would you happen to know

26:22.622 --> 26:24.499
who was driving
your store van this morning?

26:24.791 --> 26:27.377
-What happened? Was there an accident?
-Well, it’s possible

26:27.460 --> 26:29.546
that it was nearby
to where an accident occurred.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.799
We’d just like to talk to the driver.
Find out if he saw anything.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.385
Well, I was driving.
Didn’t see an accident.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.306
-Okay, then.
-Uh... you the, uh, resident snake expert?

26:39.389 --> 26:40.515
What do you need?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.934
Lookin’ for something in the way
of a blue krait.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.978
-No can do.
-Why not?

26:45.228 --> 26:48.023
-Poisonous.
-You don’t sell poisonous snakes?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.567
Right. I have a reticulated python.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.612
I have an emerald tree boa.
I have a few corn snakes.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.197
Uh... I kind of had my heart set
on a kraits.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.200
-I was told they make good companions.
-They don’t... They’re poisonous.

26:59.451 --> 27:03.496
They can’t be brought into the country.
They can’t be sold. Sorry.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.833
We need you to take a ride with us, Ralph.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.545
I’m kinda workin’.
-Well, we need to talk to you about, uh,

27:10.670 --> 27:12.881
a blue krait,
that somebody found this morning.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.591
So you’re not really here
about an accident?

27:14.841 --> 27:17.302
-Right.
-I really hate being lied to.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.095
I wish people would just say
what’s on their mind.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.265
-Say what they want... Just say it!
-Let’s go.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.686
Mark, I’ll be back in a while.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.329
Yeah?

27:44.496 --> 27:47.415
Detectives, lookin’ For J.J.
James Flaherty.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.334
-They just took him.
-Who did?

27:49.417 --> 27:51.169
Some old guy busts the door open,

27:51.252 --> 27:53.630
puts a gun at J.J.'s head
and hauled him out of here.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.382
What did he look like,
this guy who busted in?

27:55.548 --> 27:56.716
Older, he looked like a cop.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.635
Did he say he was a cop?
Did he say his name?

27:58.802 --> 28:02.222
No. He was pissed, though.
And he just took J.J. right out of here.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.307
-Who’s J.J. been pullin’ jobs with?
-What jobs?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.726
-You know what I’m talkin’ about!
-He’s never told me.

28:06.851 --> 28:10.146
All right, this "older" cop is somebody
that J.J. ripped off.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.858
Now, the fact that he dragged J.J.
out of here instead of just killin’ him,

28:13.942 --> 28:15.735
tells us that he wants
whoever your boyfriend

28:15.819 --> 28:17.987
is pullin’ jobs with. Now, who is it?

28:18.363 --> 28:21.241
I don’t know names.
J.J. keeps me out of that.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.382
-Have you heard from Roy?
-No, I thought he was with you.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.758
Do you recognize this guy?

28:40.885 --> 28:44.013
-(VOICE BREAKING) Yeah. It’s J.J.
-How do you know him?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.015
He does odd jobs for us. What’s going on?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.309
Roy grabbed J.J. up about a half hour ago.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.686
Oh, my God.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.147
We think he’s going to pick up
who J.J. robbed you with.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.190
-Do you know who that would be?
-No.

28:54.274 --> 28:57.068
-No. Let me try Roy’s cell phone.
-We’ve been tryin’. It’s not on.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.112
-How well do you know J.J.?
-JACKIE: Not very.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.991
Uh... Roy hired him to, um,
retile the bathroom.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.076
J.J. listened to Roy’s stories,

29:05.160 --> 29:07.620
so Roy kept hiring him to do things
he could have done himself.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.039
There’s a running buddy
J.J. took a collar with,

29:10.206 --> 29:11.791
Nicholas Richmond.
Does that name ring a bell?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.378
-No. I’m sorry.
-All right, Stick by the phone.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.256
If Roy calls you,
you get ahold of us immediately.

29:19.632 --> 29:23.845
-You’re not gonna hurt him, right?
-No. Just stick by the phone.

Hey!

29:34.314 --> 29:35.940
-You J.J.?
-J.J.: Yeah.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.943
I was abducted by this crazy
son of a bitch, Roy Shaughnessy.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.279
-The guy you robbed this morning?
-I don't know what you're talking about,

29:41.362 --> 29:43.156
-I was just chillin’ in my apartment...
-Where is Shaughnessy now?

29:43.239 --> 29:45.700
He went to go get my buddy, Nicky.
I’m telling you, that old man is crazy.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.286
-Where’s Nicky live?
-Three-B, but I’ve been hearing

29:48.369 --> 29:49.496
yellin’ coming from the roof.

29:49.579 --> 29:53.833
Hey! Hey, tell Nicky,
he had a gun to my head!

29:53.917 --> 29:56.878
-(GRUNTING)
-Hey!

29:58.296 --> 30:02.008
-Hey!
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

30:02.175 --> 30:06.763
Hey! Hey! Touch that gun, you’re dead!

30:06.930 --> 30:08.431
This guy chased me up here,
waving his gun.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.600
He’s crazy!
I didn’t know what he was gonna do.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.018
JOHN: Whatever you say, Nicky.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.938
It’s his gun, man.
I took it away from him.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.981
-Get up.
-(PANTS)

30:21.611 --> 30:23.279
Probably not the best way
you could have handled it, Roy.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.448
You know what happened,
I got the drain over there.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.700
I didn’t see it, I lost my balance,
that’s how he got my gun.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.410
Yeah, drains come up on you sometimes.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.788
I had the drop on the son of a bitch.
That hadn’t happened,

30:31.871 --> 30:33.832
I’d have walked them
right into the house, both of them.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.042
-All by yourself.
-Not like I haven’t done it before...

30:36.292 --> 30:39.212
Bringin’ ’em in two at a time, huh?

30:39.879 --> 30:42.799
All right, we’re gonna need to go in
and sort this out.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.592
They hit my wife...

30:46.427 --> 30:50.473
right in the face.
(EXHALES) I couldn’t do anything.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.810
-It’s all right, Roy.
-I had to beg them not to hit her again.

30:53.893 --> 30:57.647
-I had to beg them.
-It’s okay. Come on.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.985
-(EXHALES) You gonna cuff me?
-No.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.238
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

31:23.840 --> 31:26.926
-What were you doing this morning, Ralph?
-Picking up stuff at a wholesaler’s.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.720
-Where are they located?
-Various places.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.222
-Give us two.
-RALPH: One’s in Jackson Heights.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.224
And one’s over by the Kosciusko Bridge.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.310
Uh... why did you get a ticket
over on St. Mark’s place

31:35.393 --> 31:37.061
if you were goin’ by the Kosciusko Bridge?

31:37.270 --> 31:40.523
You guys never work in personal aspects
in the course of business?

31:40.732 --> 31:43.693
-What kind of personal aspects?
-A chick, all right?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.653
-Where’s she live?
-By there.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.034
-Name and address, Ralph.
-Come on, man.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.411
I give that up,
I ain’t gonna be goin’ back there.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.498
-Name Barry Tytell mean anything to you?
-No.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.337
(SIGHS) Here’s what’s gonna happen, Ralph,
we’re gonna lift the prints

32:02.420 --> 32:05.006
off the box in Barry Tytell's office,
the one the blue krait came in.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.549
We’re gonna trace the import records

32:06.633 --> 32:08.801
and find out if this type of snake
can be traced back to you.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.679
And the longer you lie to us,
the harder it’s gonna be for us to help.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.974
The fact that nobody got hurt
is gonna work in your favor.

32:16.643 --> 32:20.939
-What happened, Ralph?
-My old man had a pet store.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.068
He lost it, when he got nailed
for tax evasion.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.029
-Where is he now?
-RALPH: Danbury Federal Prison.

32:29.030 --> 32:32.492
-Did he read Tytell's book?
-My mother said, "Don’t do it."

32:32.575 --> 32:34.994
I said, "Don’t do it."
Everybody said, "Don’t do it."

32:35.161 --> 32:36.496
He’s a stubborn bastard, though,

32:36.663 --> 32:39.082
And busted his ass
for every buck he ever earned.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.918
This "No taxes" thing,
was too good for him to pass up.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.253
All right, so you set Tytell’s car
on fire.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.547
I asked that prick for help.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.884
He said my dad must have made a mistake
when he filed his returns.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.803
And the snake in the mailbox?

32:52.428 --> 32:54.389
I could have put a black mamba in there,
you know?

32:54.847 --> 32:57.475
I could have put in a taipan
or a carpet viper.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.228
I put in a krait
so he’d have a good chance of surviving.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.272
Huh, We... we’ll see that
that’s taken into account.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.817
And nothin’ happens
to this asshole, Tytell,

33:06.359 --> 33:08.403
even though he ruined my dad’s life?

33:10.822 --> 33:13.199

until we sort this out.

you work for Mr. Shaughnessy,

You bring Nicky in for lookout,
then you break in,

you threaten the Shaughnessys
with your knife

into my apartment, puts a gun to my head
and takes me over to Nicky’s.

-JOHN: Yeah,

34:10.590 --> 34:13.009
and very bad for you.
You know, it took about two minutes.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.969
The promise of a pack of cigarettes
and a cold drink

34:15.053 --> 34:16.054
and he laid it at your feet.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.057
-Sure, whatever you say.
-You knew the apartment.

34:19.140 --> 34:22.185
You knew the people who lived there,
you knew where the valuables were.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.729
-Nicky was just watchin’ the door.
-We should be talkin’ about

34:24.812 --> 34:28.858
how Shaughnessy busted Into my apartment
and put a nine millimeter to my head.

34:28.941 --> 34:31.736
Cop to the home invasion,
that will be your bargaining chip.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.197
You stonewall us
and Shaughnessy coming into your apartment

34:34.322 --> 34:35.573
never happened.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.995
All right... (BREATHES HEAVILY)
...I’ll talk...

34:41.829 --> 34:43.831
when I see what Nicky’s writin’,
when it’s in front of me.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.333
It’s just gonna make you feel bad,

34:45.500 --> 34:48.836
’cause if he gets it on record first,
it’s gospel. You’ll be suckin’ hind tit.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.005
Show me his statement and then we’ll talk.

34:51.172 --> 34:55.134
Yeah, we’ll be talkin’ about
how you’re goin’ to prison for 20 years.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.852
(DOOR CLOSING)

35:05.394 --> 35:08.147
J.J. was the lookout.
He tipped you to the Shaughnessy’s.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.734
-You pulled the job.
-No, other way around.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.953
Yeah, J.J.’s writing it up,
Nicky’s idea, Nicky was the muscle.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.372
Now, you see that, you stupid idiot?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.374
I told you that guy would fold
and now where are you?

35:26.499 --> 35:29.293
I don’t know. (EXHALES)
I... I don’t know. I got to think.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.670
You’ve been thinkin’.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.713
You’ve been overthinkin’
and look where it’s got you.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.632
I wanna see what J.J. wrote up.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.175
The hell with that.
We’ll use J.J.’s statement.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.219
-Hold up, hold up!
-No, we’re done holdin’ up.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.929
Do you want the deal or not?

35:40.096 --> 35:42.056
I’ll tell you my part
in what happened this morning.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.643
J.J. can say what he wants.
Do I still have time?

35:45.935 --> 35:47.019
Get on it.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.648
J.J. came to me with the plan
since he knew Shaughnessy.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.191
He got a little too high beforehand.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.693
Who had the knife?

35:53.985 --> 35:56.863
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
I did, but I didn’t use it.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.365
-Who punched Mrs. Shaughnessy?
-J.J. did.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.034
J.J. with no violent priors,
he did the smackin’ around?

36:02.410 --> 36:05.454
-(BREATHES HEAVILY) We both did.
-Simultaneously?

36:05.872 --> 36:08.666
She kept screaming.
I could have done worse, right?

36:10.293 --> 36:13.713
Why don’t you start with
when J.J. came to you with the plan?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.340
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

36:17.592 --> 36:20.595
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:23.222 --> 36:26.726
-So, news?
-BALDWIN: Yeah. Ralph Basset did it on

36:26.809 --> 36:29.061
account of his dad going to prison
for following your book.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.563
(SIGHS) Oh.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.441
On that subject, first off,
Kudos on the police work.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.152
I’m gonna sleep a lot easier tonight,
thanks to you guys.

36:36.402 --> 36:38.487
As far as Alvin Basset goes,
I do feel bad.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.156
I mean, how could I not?

36:40.239 --> 36:43.492
If the son reimburses me
for the damage to my car,

36:43.576 --> 36:44.577
I won’t press charges.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.913
Oh, ’cause you got such a big heart.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.707
What’s with that tone, detective?
I’m the crime victim here.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.168
The only reason you’re dropping charges,
cause you don’t want It getting out

36:52.460 --> 36:54.837
that someone who followed your advice
wound up in jail, but, guess what,

36:54.921 --> 36:56.881
I’m gonna do my best
to make sure it does get out.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.967
It’s the federal government
That wants to keep this hushed up, not me!

37:00.092 --> 37:01.886
I’m calling my friend
in the U.S. Attorney’s Office

37:01.969 --> 37:03.471
and one of these days,
the federal government’s

37:03.638 --> 37:05.640
gonna be knockin’ on your door.

37:05.848 --> 37:09.644
-Scumbag. I gotta go pick up Michael.
-Yeah, I’ll wrap this up.

37:11.979 --> 37:16.776
So... I guess...
Does that mean you don’t want this?

37:17.276 --> 37:21.739
Properly prepared tax return in your name,
that ensures you won’t pay a red cent?

37:22.031 --> 37:25.034
-File that right there.
-BARRY: Fine.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.079
You keep working for Uncle Sam,
January to June.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.165
Me? I’m gonna go piss away
some of my tax savings

37:31.249 --> 37:33.626
on two Ukrainian hookers
and a T-bone steak.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.253
You do that.

37:41.467 --> 37:45.137
-You cut deals with them?
-No, they’re gonna do straight time.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.893
(SIGHS)
I feel like one of them old police dogs

37:50.977 --> 37:53.896
out at Rodman’s neck,
run up to the fence and bark, you know,

37:53.980 --> 37:56.607
but most of the time,
they just lay around and wait to get fed.

37:56.857 --> 38:00.903
-You’re not that old, Roy.
-Yeah, tell me all the old slogans, Andy.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.072
"Growing old’s a bitch,
but it beats the alternative."

38:03.572 --> 38:05.741
There’s a certain amount of truth
to those.

38:06.784 --> 38:10.162
"You need to get out of the house, honey.
You need to pick up a hobby, Sweetheart."

38:10.246 --> 38:13.541
-How’s that gonna sound to you, Andy?
-Like good advice.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.670
-Everything okay?
-Oh, yeah.

38:19.005 --> 38:22.758
-Well, uh, thanks for your help.
-JOHN: Hey, Roy, take care.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.948
-You glad about going to your aunt’s?
-Ain’t nothin’ I can do about it.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.118
You know, I talked to her on the phone
and she seems like a nice person.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.872
-I don’t even really know her.
-Well, she seems nice.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.209
So, my dad scared off Mr. and Mrs. Gross?

38:57.877 --> 39:01.881
(INHALES) I don’t know, uh, that...
that may have factored in a little.

39:02.214 --> 39:05.343
Once he knew where I was livin’,
I told him not to come by,

39:05.426 --> 39:06.594
but he wouldn’t listen.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.513
I don’t know why
he screwed that up for me.

39:09.722 --> 39:13.059
You know, in thinking about it,
your dad acting the way he is,

39:13.601 --> 39:16.062
it’s like he thinks
I’m trying to take you away from him.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.105
So, what does that mean?
You backin’ out, too?

39:18.314 --> 39:23.194
No. No. Nothing’s changed
as far as you and me are concerned.

39:24.487 --> 39:28.324
I’m just... just trying to figure out
why your dad’s doing this.

39:28.657 --> 39:29.784
Yeah.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.954
Michael... look at me.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.125
I’m serious. I’m not backing out.

39:39.835 --> 39:40.836
(DOOR KNOCKING)

39:42.213 --> 39:44.715
-Michael’s aunt is here.
-All right. Thanks, John.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.888
Give me a minute, all right?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.441
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

40:03.526 --> 40:07.613
-Uh... Tammy, hi, I’m Detective Jones.
-Hi. Where’s Michael?

40:07.696 --> 40:11.659
Uh... he’ll be out in a second.
But I... I appreciate you doing this.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.286
I would have taken him in before,
when my sister died,

40:14.370 --> 40:17.915
but I got three kids of my own
and only two bedrooms, so...

40:18.499 --> 40:20.876
Well, I’m sure you know Michael’s,
uh, he’s a great kid.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.379
-Yeah, he’s good. He’s good.
-He’s a little nervous, though.

40:23.963 --> 40:29.051
Yeah, so am I, ’cause, uh...
I can’t have any problems with his dad.

40:29.635 --> 40:30.719
Right, that’s my only condition.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.180
I’m gonna give you my home
and pager number.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.766
If his father tries to contact you
for any reason, call me.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.811
That’s fine and all, but make sure
he doesn’t come to my place.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.605
Craig’s only allowed prearranged,
supervised visits.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.607
Other than that,
he’s in violation of his parole

40:43.816 --> 40:45.776
and he can be sent back to prison.
He knows that.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.195
But those visits,
don’t take place in my apartment.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.864
No. That will happen at social services.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.116
All right. As long as Craig knows

40:52.199 --> 40:53.617
that if he ain’t gonna make
no problems for me,

40:53.701 --> 40:55.494
I ain’t gonna make no problems for him.
