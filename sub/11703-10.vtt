WEBVTT

00:00.054 --> 00:02.807
I'm stepping down.
Because of me, Ferguson

00:02.872 --> 00:05.605
is picking you off one by one.
You can't stop now, Bea.

00:05.634 --> 00:10.347
I won't let you.
What's this?

00:10.473 --> 00:13.163
I don't know.
This is all you.

00:13.234 --> 00:17.466
This is your fault because you
started a fight you can't win.

00:17.494 --> 00:19.370
I'm fucked and so is my parole.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.332
I'm going to help you stop
self-sabotaging, Franky.

00:22.458 --> 00:26.087
I'm gonna help you get out of here.
Yeah, well, stick round, cos I'm

00:26.169 --> 00:27.963
gonna be leaving here in a coffin.

00:28.046 --> 00:30.465
I fucking killed Meg Jackson.

00:30.487 --> 00:34.615
She shat on me like Mum did.
What's going on?

00:34.671 --> 00:36.995
Back away from the fence, Doyle.
What about my parole?

00:37.006 --> 00:38.956
I'm never going to get out of here.
You'll be right.

00:38.966 --> 00:43.764
When Ferguson goes down, be careful
you don't get sucked down with her.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.303
Any particular reason
I'm on cleaning duty?

01:41.348 --> 01:43.520
Just do it, Doyle.

01:43.626 --> 01:46.322
Apparently not.

02:03.728 --> 02:10.167
Ohh! Oh, fuck!

02:33.991 --> 02:37.643
Doyle! You alright?

02:37.652 --> 02:39.706
Yeah.
You just crept up on me.

02:39.814 --> 02:42.147
Governor wants to see you.

02:43.636 --> 02:45.074
OK.

02:45.085 --> 02:48.746
This way.

02:54.823 --> 02:57.199
Mr Jackson?

03:34.221 --> 03:36.827
Mr Fletcher?
I'm not interested.

03:36.838 --> 03:39.523
You said that Ferguson
tried to kill you, yeah?

03:39.532 --> 03:41.655
Don't you want to do
something about that?

03:41.666 --> 03:43.386
No.
I don't blame you for being

03:43.396 --> 03:45.680
pissed off with me, but you've
gotta look at the bigger picture.

03:45.689 --> 03:48.216
I'm a walking dead man.
I can't do anything.

03:48.226 --> 03:49.735
No, but your job is
to look after these women.

03:49.801 --> 03:53.141
Stop fucking with me.
I'm not your saviour.

03:57.272 --> 03:59.075
Well, that went well.

03:59.084 --> 04:01.982
No shit, Wonder Woman.

04:04.373 --> 04:07.109
You wanted to see me?
Yes, sit down.

04:09.202 --> 04:13.066
Your parole hearing.

04:13.146 --> 04:14.595
What about it?

04:17.814 --> 04:19.625
Well, due to ah,

04:19.745 --> 04:23.086
various circumstances there's
been a scheduling change.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.656
It's been postponed?

04:24.736 --> 04:27.553
No, it has been moved forward.

04:27.674 --> 04:32.744
Tomorrow morning at,
ah, 10.00 AM.

04:32.865 --> 04:36.205
That a problem?
Does... does Ms Westfall know?

04:36.326 --> 04:38.901
Everyone who needs to
be informed has been.

04:39.022 --> 04:40.471
What, were you concerned
about preparation time?

04:40.551 --> 04:42.443
Nah, it's all good.

04:42.563 --> 04:46.627
10.00 AM then.
I'll look forward to it.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.157
What do you mean?

04:48.277 --> 04:51.497
I'll be making my own statement,
considering the merits for parole

04:51.578 --> 04:54.072
in your particular case.

04:54.153 --> 04:56.206
Well, see you then.

04:56.286 --> 04:58.459
You shall.

05:05.703 --> 05:08.761
Governor, we'll need to consider
working arrangements in the kitchen.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.377
When Doyle gets parole.

05:11.498 --> 05:14.918
Well, let's just wait
and see first, shall we?

05:14.999 --> 05:16.889
You don't think she'll get parole?

05:16.971 --> 05:19.063
I didn't say that.

05:33.582 --> 05:35.513
Hi.
Hi.

05:37.123 --> 05:39.498
You wanted to see me.

05:39.577 --> 05:42.034
I owe you an apology.

05:44.771 --> 05:47.146
I suspect you're right
about Governor Ferguson.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.400
What made you change your mind?

05:51.010 --> 05:53.062
I think Ferguson

05:53.183 --> 05:55.678
left the pencil
in Jodie Spiteri's cell.

05:57.329 --> 05:59.382
Can you prove it?
No.

06:00.991 --> 06:03.971
But I read your notes on Ferguson.

06:04.051 --> 06:06.828
Why is she victimising Jodie?

06:06.908 --> 06:09.002
I think Jodie's just a pawn.

06:09.122 --> 06:12.463
Psychopaths often take an elaborate
path to get to their real target.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.683
Why haven't you gone to the Board?
Because I can't prove it.

06:15.803 --> 06:20.352
Ferguson made sure that Jodie
Spiteri is not a viable witness.

06:20.473 --> 06:23.531
So we just have to wait for
her to do something else?

06:25.223 --> 06:28.442
If I find proof
and I go to the Board with it,

06:30.093 --> 06:33.876
will you support me?
Absolutely.

06:33.996 --> 06:37.217
But after Franky Doyle's
parole is granted.

06:40.116 --> 06:41.765
You're aware that Doyle's hearing's

06:41.886 --> 06:44.179
been brought forward?
No, I wasn't.

06:45.991 --> 06:47.682
It's tomorrow, 10.00 AM.

06:49.615 --> 06:52.028
Is she ready?

06:55.572 --> 06:59.637
What the fuck!
Are you going to close that?

07:11.108 --> 07:13.643
Nuh. No way.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.496
Well, Franky...
I don't have time for this shit,

07:15.576 --> 07:17.548
Soph. Get your stuff and go.

07:17.628 --> 07:19.601
Franky, I thought...

07:19.682 --> 07:21.372
What'd you think?

07:21.493 --> 07:25.477
Well, you and me.
Why?

07:26.589 --> 07:28.925
Doesn't matter.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.912
Look, the Freak's trying
to fuck with my parole.

07:33.032 --> 07:36.213
I haven't even started
writing up my statement.

07:36.334 --> 07:39.193
Better get your gear on, eh?
Come on.

07:39.273 --> 07:41.609
Well, can you not look at me?

07:47.446 --> 07:49.098
I'm sorry, OK?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.702
Cute girl in my bed,
usually I'd be all over it.

07:58.883 --> 08:01.380
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:05.004 --> 08:07.058
I don't know, Doyle, alright?

08:07.178 --> 08:09.716
Come on, Mr Fletcher.
I need time to prepare.

08:09.836 --> 08:11.930
Well, lunch shift has
already started

08:12.010 --> 08:13.581
and you're rostered on.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.112
Yeah, and the crew'll
be fine without me.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.527
They know what they're doing.
You've squared that away with them?

08:17.608 --> 08:19.863
Yeah. Booms?

08:19.985 --> 08:21.796
What?
You're good with me missing

08:21.918 --> 08:24.132
lunch shift, aren't ya?
Be a fuckin' pleasure.

08:24.253 --> 08:28.400
They're good.
I've been training them up for this.

08:28.521 --> 08:32.466
OK. But if lunch is late,
it's your arse on the line.

08:40.802 --> 08:43.972
You changed your mind?
Nah.

08:43.982 --> 08:48.251
Nah, we're all good.
Thanks, boss.

08:53.847 --> 08:55.612
What the fuck!
What are you doing?

08:55.623 --> 08:58.962
You're acting like a little kid.
I'm not doing anything.

08:59.083 --> 09:02.264
You are bringing shit
through the kitchen. I saw it.

09:02.384 --> 09:05.205
What if I am, huh?
What do you care?

09:05.325 --> 09:08.546
It's my kitchen. They trace it
back here, there goes my parole.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.641
Your parole?

09:10.721 --> 09:12.614
I fucking loved you, Franky.

09:12.735 --> 09:15.674
Oh, look I never made you
any promises, OK?

09:15.794 --> 09:18.534
Now you know what Red thinks
about drugs. You thought about that?

09:18.654 --> 09:22.077
Not everyone dances
to her tune anymore.

09:22.198 --> 09:26.063
And you're still pining after that
shrink, so unless you're gonna lag,

09:26.183 --> 09:29.002
you can fuck off
and leave me alone.

09:29.123 --> 09:33.472
I am just saying, do not screw
up your life because of me.

09:33.553 --> 09:35.929
Doyle?

09:36.050 --> 09:39.784
Thought you had to prepare
for your parole hearing. Huh?

09:39.795 --> 09:43.247
Yes. I'm just going.

09:43.257 --> 09:44.626
Back in the kitchen.

10:24.451 --> 10:26.465
Jesus! Fuck!

10:38.585 --> 10:43.045
How are there drugs
in this prison again?

10:43.055 --> 10:45.300
Did you search her?

10:45.310 --> 10:48.089
Nothing on her, Governor.
Toss her cell.

10:48.209 --> 10:50.453
There's more where this came
from and I want it found.

10:50.464 --> 10:52.991
Yes, Governor.
Now!

10:53.001 --> 10:54.049
Yes, Governor.

11:14.815 --> 11:16.784
You wanted to see me, Governor?

11:19.482 --> 11:21.451
What is this, Mr Fletcher?

11:23.787 --> 11:27.446
Ah, it's bread.
Take a closer look.

11:33.805 --> 11:36.942
Clearly the heroin responsible
for prisoner Lou's overdose arrived

11:37.062 --> 11:39.357
here, delivered to
the kitchen this morning.

11:39.477 --> 11:43.812
During your shift, Mr Fletcher.
Did you search the deliveries?

11:43.822 --> 11:45.471
Yes.
Thoroughly?

11:45.591 --> 11:48.649
Apparently not.
And why not?

11:48.771 --> 11:52.110
Well, there was just
a lot of produce.

11:52.230 --> 11:55.440
A woman is dead because
of your incompetence,

11:55.449 --> 11:57.541
and the others are at further risk.
I'm sorry.

11:57.662 --> 12:01.042
This is not a sheltered
workshop, Mr Fletcher.

12:01.163 --> 12:03.052
But you are going to end up
in one if you don't find

12:03.173 --> 12:04.906
the rest of this contra-band.
Is that clear?

12:07.116 --> 12:08.685
Look at me.

12:08.806 --> 12:12.105
Do as I say. I will speak
slowly so you understand.

12:12.225 --> 12:17.337
Toss the kitchen workers' cells
immediately.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.186
You can start with
Doyle's unit first.

12:20.836 --> 12:22.928
Now!
Attention compound.

12:23.049 --> 12:26.429
All prisoners return to their units
immediately for lockdown.

12:28.199 --> 12:31.861
Kim! What have you done?

12:35.201 --> 12:36.246
Oh, fuck.

12:38.861 --> 12:42.390
Do you know anything about
these drugs coming in?

12:42.401 --> 12:44.764
Well, do you?

12:44.775 --> 12:47.864
What's going on?
Well, call me paranoid...

12:47.873 --> 12:50.679
What?
Did you see Kim?

12:50.690 --> 12:52.581
Yeah.

12:54.391 --> 12:57.649
Franky...
Fuck!

13:01.553 --> 13:02.638
Shit.

13:02.719 --> 13:04.490
Flush 'em.

13:04.611 --> 13:06.099
Close the door!
OK, it's a cell toss, ladies.

13:06.179 --> 13:08.110
You know the drill.

13:09.921 --> 13:13.903
Smith, back to your cell.
The fuck!

13:14.023 --> 13:17.244
Let me know if you
need anything, Franky.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.813
Doyle, open the door.
She's not feeling very good,

13:18.933 --> 13:22.837
Mr Fletcher.
I don't give a shit, Smith.

13:22.957 --> 13:24.525
There's been an OD and I'm
getting the blame for it.

13:24.646 --> 13:27.583
Well, why're you picking on us?
We're clean, alright?

13:27.704 --> 13:29.675
That'd be why you got
another seven years, right?

13:29.757 --> 13:32.009
I'm opening the door, Doyle, now.

13:32.090 --> 13:34.545
What the fuck!

13:34.665 --> 13:36.958
I was taking a dump!
Out.

13:38.888 --> 13:41.052
God!

13:41.062 --> 13:45.006
Why don't you hurry it up? I've
got a parole hearing to prep for.

13:45.086 --> 13:47.972
Ms Miles.

13:47.982 --> 13:50.799
Mr Fletcher.

13:51.644 --> 13:54.540
When I entered the unit
the prisoner's door was closed.

13:54.661 --> 13:57.035
I opened the door
and observed Doyle.

13:57.155 --> 14:00.696
She appeared to be hiding
something in her tracksuit pants.

14:00.817 --> 14:05.847
I'm not sure what it is, but
I reckon that she's banked it.

14:07.494 --> 14:09.948
Well, let's hope your
assumption is correct.

14:10.068 --> 14:13.329
I'm holding you responsible
for those drugs. Slot her.

14:25.801 --> 14:29.141
Doyle, your permission is
required for a body cavity search.

14:29.261 --> 14:32.037
You are not obliged to submit
to a search but your refusal will

14:32.158 --> 14:34.531
indicate you are holding.
Is that clear?

14:34.652 --> 14:37.429
No fucking way.
I take it you are refusing?

14:37.548 --> 14:39.400
What do you think?
Very well.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.744
You will stay here in isolation
until you do submit to a search.

14:43.865 --> 14:47.769
If you agree in a timely manner,
and prove yourself innocent,

14:47.889 --> 14:49.982
you will be able to attend your
parole hearing in the morning.

14:50.103 --> 14:55.291
And don't think that you can get
rid of anything without us knowing.

14:55.373 --> 14:58.390
Twenty four hour observation,

14:58.469 --> 15:00.762
and there's a grate in the latrine.

15:02.373 --> 15:04.223
You know, I have to say, Doyle,

15:04.304 --> 15:07.443
I expected better of you.

15:07.564 --> 15:11.667
But I s'pose you can't help
but self-destruct, can you?

15:26.869 --> 15:31.493
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

15:36.899 --> 15:38.153
Thanks.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.994
Hey, Dor, are you OK?
No, I'm not.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.077
What happened to your
'no drugs' policy, eh?

15:43.161 --> 15:46.261
I don't want Josh
seeing this ugly shit.

15:46.382 --> 15:48.393
He's just a baby, Dor. He
wouldn't have even registered it.

15:48.624 --> 15:52.006
Not yet, but in a year's time,
he will. I don't want him in a

15:52.127 --> 15:55.104
place where he's going to see dead
bodies and junkies shooting up.

15:56.716 --> 15:59.211
Look, I took my eye off the ball.

15:59.331 --> 16:00.860
But I've shut it down now.
It's going to stop.

16:00.982 --> 16:03.638
Really?
Yeah.

16:09.715 --> 16:12.211
Have Anderson brought up to see me.

16:12.332 --> 16:15.311
After what's happened with Nash,
I'm completely freaked out.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.128
I can't even talk to him.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.785
I know.
Anderson.

16:20.865 --> 16:22.799
Governor wants to see ya.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.997
Just be careful.

16:36.242 --> 16:38.616
Hey, everyone. Oh, don't worry.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.790
Just here to see Kim.

16:40.870 --> 16:43.970
Pay our condolences for Cindy Lou.

16:45.582 --> 16:47.755
Yeah, big loss.

16:50.169 --> 16:51.981
Oh, we were wondering
what you were doing in H2?

16:52.061 --> 16:54.153
What?

16:54.273 --> 16:57.243
Oh, I just wanted to see if
Boomer wanted to come and...

16:57.254 --> 16:59.588
Oh, so you weren't planting
drugs on Franky, then.

17:01.399 --> 17:03.050
No way. Is that what she's saying?

17:03.170 --> 17:04.057
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:04.178 --> 17:05.625
Yeah, is it because
she ditched you?

17:05.705 --> 17:07.395
She's such a bitch.

17:07.476 --> 17:09.691
No.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.025
Bea, I haven't done anything.

17:12.106 --> 17:13.796
I'm not into drugs, you know that.

17:13.877 --> 17:15.568
Don't fuckin' lie to me.

17:15.648 --> 17:17.742
You know my policy.

17:17.863 --> 17:20.317
You're gonna pay, Kim.
So will your little mates.

17:20.479 --> 17:23.900
You won't know when I'm coming
for you but when I do, I'm gonna smash you.

17:23.980 --> 17:26.960
Now fuck off!

17:33.043 --> 17:34.735
I'll be mother, shall I?

17:36.467 --> 17:37.959
Sugar?

17:38.079 --> 17:40.615
Two, thanks.
Well, that's not best for baby.

17:40.697 --> 17:42.511
Let's make it one.

17:43.597 --> 17:45.410
Where is he?

17:45.490 --> 17:47.544
With Jess Warner, Governor.

17:52.056 --> 17:56.448
The police have charged Nash
Taylor with drug trafficking.

17:56.569 --> 17:59.266
He's looking at
another seven years.

18:00.918 --> 18:03.898
I don't believe it
was him, Governor.

18:04.019 --> 18:07.153
Yeah, it's difficult isn't it when
there's been such a breach of trust.

18:07.162 --> 18:12.318
Betrayal of any kind
can be so destructive.

18:16.063 --> 18:18.400
Jianna.

18:18.481 --> 18:20.857
You remember her?

18:20.938 --> 18:23.236
She made a number of poor choices.

18:23.355 --> 18:26.900
Who she was involved with,
what she put into her body,

18:26.980 --> 18:28.631
that sort of thing.

18:28.712 --> 18:31.534
I couldn't save her, or her baby.

18:33.184 --> 18:36.365
I would hate to see
such a tragedy repeated.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.279
I'm not involved in
anything like that,

18:41.399 --> 18:43.454
and I don't believe Nash
was either, Governor.

18:43.576 --> 18:46.152
Well, unfortunately
the facts say otherwise.

18:46.274 --> 18:48.167
And I see, despite my
warnings, you continue

18:48.248 --> 18:49.739
to associate with Bea Smith.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.446
Well, it's hard to avoid her,
Governor. She's in my unit.

18:53.527 --> 18:55.822
But I'm not her crew.

18:55.943 --> 18:59.848
All I want to do is look after
my baby. That's my only interest.

19:02.952 --> 19:04.563
Try the biscuit.

19:04.642 --> 19:06.455
Go on.

19:09.397 --> 19:11.450
Oh, the police are
satisfied that you're not

19:11.530 --> 19:13.102
involved in Mr Taylor's scheme.

19:13.222 --> 19:17.209
But they have requested that
you undergo drug testing.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.313
Just to be sure.

19:21.198 --> 19:23.052
And, Doreen, your samples will have

19:23.172 --> 19:25.346
certain trace hormones due to
the fact you're breastfeeding.

19:25.467 --> 19:29.980
If there's any attempt to switch,
it will be fairly obvious.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.322
Let's not have a repeat
of last time, hmm?

19:44.050 --> 19:46.946
Oh, God, Dor!

19:47.030 --> 19:49.601
Oh, lovey. Are you right?

19:50.646 --> 19:53.702
Oh, honey, are you OK?

19:55.312 --> 19:58.367
Ferguson's gonna try
and take Joshua away.

19:58.449 --> 20:01.103
But she can't do that.

20:01.223 --> 20:04.880
Oh, you don't reckon? She's
put me in for a drug test, Liz.

20:04.961 --> 20:07.173
But you don't use drugs.

20:07.293 --> 20:11.397
I think she set me up. I mean,
she gave me something to eat.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.204
What? Why?

20:13.284 --> 20:15.416
I don't know.

20:15.537 --> 20:19.155
Maybe she wants me, maybe she
wants my baby. I don't know.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.145
How're you doing in there?

20:25.227 --> 20:27.600
Oh, yeah, OK.

20:27.721 --> 20:30.978
Here, I'm done.
Thanks, Doreen.

20:31.098 --> 20:33.793
We'll have the results
back as soon as we can.

20:33.873 --> 20:36.166
The Governor's insistent on that.

20:36.246 --> 20:39.100
Ah, Ms Atkins?

20:39.218 --> 20:40.426
Mm?
Can I talk to you?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.275
Yeah.

20:48.548 --> 20:54.570
He's so beautiful, Doreen.
I'm absolutely rapt for you.

20:54.580 --> 20:57.302
Look at that little mouth.

20:57.313 --> 20:59.968
It's absolutely perfect.

21:01.498 --> 21:04.512
Dor, what's wrong?

21:09.297 --> 21:11.107
Look, things are bad here.

21:12.956 --> 21:15.238
Will you...

21:15.249 --> 21:17.983
Would you take Josh?

21:19.791 --> 21:22.527
What do you mean, take him?

21:22.647 --> 21:25.702
Take him where?
Just away from here.

21:25.823 --> 21:27.993
Can you look after him for
me, just until I get out?

21:28.116 --> 21:30.287
Dor!
Look, I know

21:30.407 --> 21:33.342
it's a big ask, and you need
some time to think it over.

21:33.463 --> 21:38.812
Just don't take too long, OK?
But he's only two weeks old.

21:38.892 --> 21:41.344
At least keep him for a few months.

21:41.465 --> 21:44.278
You know, you're breastfeeding.
I know.

21:44.399 --> 21:47.206
But every day he stays
in here he's in danger,

21:47.215 --> 21:50.590
and that's worse, much,
much worse. I need him safe.

21:53.206 --> 21:56.826
Please say you'll think about it.
Please.

21:58.555 --> 22:00.604
Yep.

23:05.488 --> 23:06.845
Well?

23:06.855 --> 23:09.903
You said I could leave if I gave
permission for a cavity search.

23:09.914 --> 23:14.300
Yes.
Get it over with.

23:18.203 --> 23:21.704
Leave us.

23:23.838 --> 23:26.734
Shouldn't I stay?
Go.

23:42.871 --> 23:45.727
Off they come.

23:50.676 --> 23:54.459
Are you OK?
What do you think?

23:58.684 --> 24:02.385
Booms.
What?

24:05.202 --> 24:09.025
I really need a favour.

24:37.031 --> 24:39.759
That should do the trick.
Thank you, Booms.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.212
Pear juice and canola.

24:42.223 --> 24:46.678
You've swallowed them, haven't ya?
Well, I didn't have much choice,

24:46.688 --> 24:48.892
did I?
Karma's a bitch, eh?

24:48.902 --> 24:52.645
The mother of all bitches.

25:00.089 --> 25:03.098
Just piss off and leave me to it.

25:03.107 --> 25:06.528
Fine.

25:39.685 --> 25:42.812
I've accepted that
what I did was wrong,

25:42.822 --> 25:45.399
and I'm a good person.

25:50.750 --> 25:54.683
I have taken an Advanced Diploma
in Legal Studies at Callum Uni.

25:54.694 --> 25:57.821
I've undertaken leadership
positions in all my work details.

25:57.832 --> 26:02.097
And I've encouraged
other inmates to do the same.

26:06.001 --> 26:10.417
Now fuckin' hell.
And I've completed all

26:10.427 --> 26:14.331
anti-recidivist programs
available to me.

26:16.503 --> 26:18.706
I'm not a good person!

26:18.716 --> 26:22.690
I am a good person and I am
a responsible member of society.

26:22.701 --> 26:30.578
I fucking killed Meg Jackson!
She shat on me like Mum did,

26:30.588 --> 26:34.360
and that's what I hang onto when I
see her dying. I pretend it was Mum.

26:34.370 --> 26:39.268
I've accepted that what I did
was wrong. I'm responsible.

26:39.278 --> 26:41.763
There's no question of that.

26:41.773 --> 26:46.712
And that's what I hang onto when
I see her at night. I pretend it was Mum.

26:46.722 --> 26:49.096
Thank you for your time.

27:10.543 --> 27:14.635
Hey, what's going on? Boomer tells
me you've got a gutful of heroin.

27:14.645 --> 27:16.972
It's none of your business.
Yeah, it is.

27:16.981 --> 27:18.819
You've got to get yourself
to Medical now.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.190
Uh uh. No, doing more time
is better than dying.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.201
I'd rather die.

27:22.211 --> 27:24.616
Well, I'm not going to
let you do that. Franky!

27:24.628 --> 27:28.247
Get up.
You ready, Doyle?

27:29.254 --> 27:30.903
Yep.

27:37.381 --> 27:39.353
Ms Bennett.

27:41.849 --> 27:46.305
How long's this going to take?
What's it to you, Smith?

27:46.315 --> 27:50.702
See you on the flipside, Red.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.740
Francesca Doyle.

28:59.750 --> 29:03.041
Your Honour.
Do you feel you're ready to be

29:03.050 --> 29:07.426
a responsible member of society?
Yes. Yes, I am.

29:07.437 --> 29:13.463
I've, um, I've accepted that what I
did was wrong, and I've worked hard

29:13.474 --> 29:16.330
to earn the right
to an early release.

29:28.081 --> 29:32.737
I'm taking an Advanced Diploma in
Legal Studies at Callum University

29:32.747 --> 29:36.651
and I've assisted other...
Oh...

29:45.019 --> 29:49.074
I've, um...

29:49.084 --> 29:53.782
Ms Doyle, are you alright?
Yeah. I'm sorry.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.402
I've, um...

29:59.507 --> 30:03.802
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:03.811 --> 30:08.470
Yeah, God.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.890
I'm not gonna lie to ya.

30:11.899 --> 30:17.051
I don't know.

30:20.712 --> 30:25.933
I know why I chucked hot oil at
that guy, and it had nothing

30:25.944 --> 30:31.174
to do with him. It was about me.

30:33.065 --> 30:38.780
I was an angry person and
that anger had control of me.

30:40.027 --> 30:45.570
I realised I had a lot to change and
I've worked bloody hard to do it.

30:45.579 --> 30:49.272
Maybe not hard enough.

30:49.281 --> 30:53.578
But I do know that I don't ever want
to go back to being that angry girl

30:53.588 --> 30:56.887
in the kitchen.

30:58.455 --> 31:01.060
That's the truth.

31:01.070 --> 31:05.931
Thank you. You can take a seat.
Thank you.

31:05.942 --> 31:09.835
Ms Westfall, your statement please?

31:09.844 --> 31:13.336
I have worked in Corrections
for nearly twenty years now,

31:13.346 --> 31:16.433
so I am no new hand here.

31:16.444 --> 31:20.457
But I have never treated a client
with such potential as Franky

31:20.466 --> 31:25.809
Doyle. You know, she has been
utterly honest with you here today.

31:25.819 --> 31:32.248
Maybe too honest. But she has faced
up to herself, and acknowledged

31:32.258 --> 31:37.600
that no-one has complete control.
She is a work in progress and she

31:37.610 --> 31:42.629
understands that. I think that is
important. I believe she's as ready

31:42.640 --> 31:48.224
for parole as anyone could be.
Thank you, Ms Westfall.

31:48.234 --> 31:52.164
Ms Ferguson?

31:52.174 --> 31:55.546
No objection to parole,
Your Honour.

31:55.555 --> 31:57.438
Thank you for your brevity,
Governor.

31:57.447 --> 32:03.916
Ms Doyle, is there anything
else that you'd like to add before this...

32:03.925 --> 32:09.910
Ms Doyle.
Ms Doyle, are you not well?

32:09.920 --> 32:15.948
I think I... Can I...
Can I be excused, please?

32:15.958 --> 32:19.688
Can I... Can I please be excused?

32:19.698 --> 32:24.678
I think perhaps we should suspend
this hearing, Your Honour.

32:24.688 --> 32:27.665
Escort her to Medical.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.142
What?
Where do you think you're going?

32:55.151 --> 32:58.610
I'd rather spew in my own cell,
thank you very much.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.867
Come here.
What the hell?

33:09.878 --> 33:12.200
You remember this, Franky?
Let go!

33:12.211 --> 33:14.012
You remember this, Franky?
Mr Jackson? Fucking careful!

33:14.022 --> 33:20.693
Mr Jackson, please!
Come on! You. You killed my wife!

33:20.702 --> 33:23.278
What? Don't fuckin' try to
fuckin' deny it, alright?

33:26.898 --> 33:29.142
Go on, Franky, admit it.

33:29.153 --> 33:33.568
Fucking admit it! Tell the truth
for once in your life, Franky.

33:33.578 --> 33:39.051
Just tell the truth, please.
You did it, didn't you? Hey?

33:45.047 --> 33:52.601
It was an accident. Just do it.
Do it. I don't blame you.

33:52.612 --> 33:57.591
I'd do the same. I've looked you
in the eyes that many times and

33:57.602 --> 34:06.293
I've seen your pain. I deserve it.
Just do it. I don't deserve...

34:15.790 --> 34:18.202
No.

34:49.146 --> 34:52.003
I'm sorry, Mr Jackson.

35:05.634 --> 35:08.733
Have you guys seen Doreen?
Yeah, she's having a visit

35:08.742 --> 35:11.851
with her sister, love.
Why didn't she tell me?

35:11.881 --> 35:15.785
What, answering to you now, is she?
No, I just wanted to know

35:15.795 --> 35:18.298
where she was.
Hey.

35:19.145 --> 35:21.232
Franky.

35:21.243 --> 35:25.360
Hey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:25.435 --> 35:28.219
Are you sure?
Yes, for fuck's sake!

35:30.068 --> 35:34.699
Hey, Jess, I've got a
plumbing job for you.

35:34.709 --> 35:38.414
What?
Hey, Franky. Don't flush.

35:38.424 --> 35:40.844
I don't want to.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.570
Mr Fletcher, can we please talk?

35:51.580 --> 35:53.385
How many times do I have to
tell you, I'm not interested?

35:53.396 --> 35:56.696
OK, those drugs you're after?
The ones that Ferguson's holding

35:56.706 --> 36:01.338
you accountable for. What if I told
you where you could find them, hmm?

36:01.348 --> 36:04.486
Can we talk then?
Please, please believe me!

36:04.495 --> 36:09.368
No, I don't know how that shit
got into my mattress, OK?

36:09.378 --> 36:14.332
It's not mine. Someone planted it!
Please, I'm telling the...

36:14.342 --> 36:17.480
I don't even do drugs!
You're full of surprises,

36:17.489 --> 36:22.253
Mr Fletcher.
Try and keep up the good work.

36:35.006 --> 36:38.093
Sis.

36:40.136 --> 36:42.733
Sorry.

36:42.742 --> 36:46.419
No, you're right.
Um...

36:46.430 --> 36:52.150
you said you signed all the papers?
Yeah. The nurse was really helpful.

36:52.161 --> 36:56.078
She explained it's just temporary
custody, not like adoption.

36:56.087 --> 37:01.289
She said it's really common, Dor.
Happens all the time.

37:01.298 --> 37:04.853
Lots of women don't think prison's
a good place for their baby.

37:04.863 --> 37:11.026
I'll bring him as often as I can.
It's a long way from Albury

37:11.036 --> 37:15.755
with a baby.
Oh, sis, we'll manage.

37:15.764 --> 37:20.976
And by the time he's
walking, you'll be out.

37:25.184 --> 37:27.336
Now, you're alright
for money, yeah?

37:27.347 --> 37:31.507
We'll be fine.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.321
OK. I don't think
I've forgotten anything.

37:35.764 --> 37:38.920
Nappies. I'll get
some more tomorrow.

37:38.930 --> 37:44.662
Reckon he'll be needing
this bloke, won't he?

37:52.675 --> 37:55.041
Oh, sis.

37:57.927 --> 38:01.334
It's OK.

38:09.270 --> 38:13.557
We'd better get going, Dor.
Gotta make that train.

38:26.704 --> 38:29.828
I'm sorry. I can't.

38:31.793 --> 38:37.964
I just... I can't do it. I can't.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.240
That's OK. That's OK.

38:42.251 --> 38:48.064
I'm sorry. I can't.

38:50.751 --> 38:52.794
I can't.

38:59.166 --> 39:02.685
Thank you.
Everything alright, Mr Jackson?

39:02.694 --> 39:04.285
It's all fine.

39:04.295 --> 39:06.528
You look like you've
had a rough day.

39:06.538 --> 39:12.271
Governor...
Don't... touch me! Thank you.

39:21.049 --> 39:23.402
I really mucked her around.

39:23.412 --> 39:27.570
I am sure she understands. And if

39:27.580 --> 39:31.058
you ever find you're struggling,
you could elect to share custody.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.501
Maybe even go for
a weekend sign out.

39:33.511 --> 39:36.107
No, Josh stays with me.
I won't be changing my mind again.

39:36.118 --> 39:42.240
OK. Your drug test came back clean,
by the way. So that's good news.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.884
I was looking all over for you.

39:44.894 --> 39:47.249
Bea said you were
going to send Joshy away.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.694
Doreen's actually decided that
she's going to be keeping Josh

39:49.704 --> 39:51.978
with her at Wentworth...
How could you even consider doing that?

39:51.987 --> 39:54.182
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.868
Well, it's really up to
Doreen and her sister, Jess.

39:56.879 --> 40:00.637
But I'm his other carer.
Yes, and you're not his mother.

40:00.646 --> 40:03.050
Thank you, Ms Atkins.
You've been really kind.

40:07.298 --> 40:08.780
Right, let's go.

40:09.824 --> 40:13.059
See, this is what I was afraid of.

40:13.068 --> 40:17.628
You know, she's really struggling.
What do you mean?

40:17.638 --> 40:21.115
Well, sending her baby off
with a complete stranger. That

40:21.124 --> 40:24.813
beautiful boy's not safe with her.

40:50.101 --> 40:52.534
Alright, there's no-one else here.

40:52.544 --> 40:56.383
Kim Chang?
Slotted.

40:56.393 --> 40:58.468
Yeah.

40:58.478 --> 41:03.485
So you ready to
take on Ferguson, then?

41:05.650 --> 41:08.656
I hope you've got a
bigger army than me.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.958
Hey.

41:23.967 --> 41:28.244
Love, you right?

41:28.253 --> 41:33.814
I did something today that made me realise
what I put Su Yun through before she died.

41:33.824 --> 41:38.025
Oh.
And what I put you through.

41:38.036 --> 41:46.091
And all the people I've hurt. Mr
Jackson, Su Yun, Boomer, Kim, you.

41:50.175 --> 41:56.739
And I'm sorry, Liz.
I don't deserve parole.

41:56.749 --> 41:59.344
I'm not worthy.

41:59.355 --> 42:04.885
Come here. Come on.
Come here.

42:06.809 --> 42:08.532
Oh, love.

42:16.868 --> 42:21.387
Now listen, OK.

42:21.397 --> 42:26.119
You have more than done
your time here. You have.

42:26.130 --> 42:34.853
Listen, listen. And you have had
a big change of heart and mind.

42:34.863 --> 42:38.501
And I reckon that's what makes
you worthy for parole, love.

42:38.511 --> 42:46.515
That's what makes you worthy, OK?
That's what makes you worthy.

42:46.526 --> 42:49.970
Yeah?

43:01.635 --> 43:05.443
You're a good Mum, Liz.
Oh, darlin'.

43:07.326 --> 43:12.768
And Soph's a good kid.
Yeah, well, you've been the one

43:12.777 --> 43:14.894
looking after her, because she
wouldn't let me do it, would she?

43:14.904 --> 43:20.232
Yeah, but she needs her Mum.
And so did you, love.

43:23.797 --> 43:30.051
Oh, that's an old excuse, and
it's not good enough anymore.

43:33.978 --> 43:36.183
Thank you.

43:44.598 --> 43:46.402
It's alright.
