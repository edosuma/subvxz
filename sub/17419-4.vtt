WEBVTT

00:02.177 --> 00:04.493
Skate, you... skate, you lazy...

00:04.578 --> 00:06.278
Goddamn it.

00:06.364 --> 00:09.248
Have you ever seen a
more heartbreaking sight?

00:09.300 --> 00:11.050
A grown man living

00:11.085 --> 00:12.718
<i>in abject squalor.</i>

00:12.753 --> 00:14.336
<i>This...</i>

00:14.422 --> 00:16.221
this is my brother Josh.

00:16.257 --> 00:20.207
<i>He subsists on a diet of ramen, weed,</i>

00:20.209 --> 00:22.428
<i>and frozen chimichangas.</i>

00:22.463 --> 00:25.548
<i>He's been wearing the same pair
of pants for a decade. He has</i>

00:25.633 --> 00:27.816
no education and can barely read or write.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.436
Hey, what? I-I can do both those.

00:30.521 --> 00:33.472
When Josh was dating
Maggie, he ate regular meals

00:33.524 --> 00:35.607
and washed his private parts.

00:35.693 --> 00:38.327
<i>But since she dumped him, his condition has</i>

00:38.412 --> 00:40.612
<i>steadily declined.</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:42.665
Right now things are bleak.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.117
But you can make a difference.

00:45.153 --> 00:48.120
Please call his number
today and date my brother.

00:48.205 --> 00:50.723
Liz, I really don't
think this is necessary.

00:50.758 --> 00:52.441
Make no mistake, dating my brother would be

00:52.526 --> 00:54.259
a true act of charity.

00:54.295 --> 00:56.445
He smells like shit.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.487
What?

00:57.489 --> 00:59.848
Like, I think he literally
might have shit himself.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.383
Did you shit yourself, Josh?

01:01.469 --> 01:04.019
No. Would you just mind your own business?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.560
I didn't... Who invited you here anyway?

01:06.562 --> 01:08.507
I'm-I'm running shit.

01:08.593 --> 01:10.476
- Did you shit yourself?
- Would you just mind your own business?

01:10.561 --> 01:11.727
- You did, didn't you?
- Stop...

01:11.812 --> 01:13.696
- You shit in your pants.
- helping.

01:13.781 --> 01:16.365
Please help. There's no one
on Earth more desperately

01:16.450 --> 01:18.817
- in need of a girlfriend.
- Liz, I told you,

01:18.903 --> 01:21.687
I don't know that I
want a girlfriend, okay?

01:21.772 --> 01:23.489
I just got out of a very long-term thing.

01:23.574 --> 01:25.240
I'm kind of happy just being...

01:25.326 --> 01:27.042
Oh, no.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.961
Oh, please, please

01:28.996 --> 01:30.379
date my brother.

01:30.464 --> 01:31.830
No.

01:31.882 --> 01:34.249
Oh, my God.

01:34.335 --> 01:37.553

I did. I-I am here.

02:11.288 --> 02:13.205

02:13.290 --> 02:14.957
- Yeah, you-you as well.
- Thank you.

02:15.042 --> 02:18.010
Oh, hey, uh, Leo, I didn't,
uh, realize you were in town.

02:18.045 --> 02:21.073
Yeah. Just came in for
the weekend. I had to see

02:21.075 --> 02:21.948
this little number.

02:21.950 --> 02:23.716
Oh, yeah, 'cause apparently
he missed me or something.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.717
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

02:25.803 --> 02:27.186
- Gonna turn around.
- Kiss me.

02:27.221 --> 02:29.021
Stare over here.

02:29.056 --> 02:31.140
Cool.

02:31.225 --> 02:33.308
Let me introduce you to everyone.

02:33.394 --> 02:34.693
- Oh, holy... smokes, yeah.
- Everybody here.

02:34.728 --> 02:37.312
Uh, this is Kurt and Katie.

02:37.398 --> 02:38.781
Zach and Xander.

02:38.866 --> 02:40.732
And Tim and Tam.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.067
Hi. Hi, gang.

02:42.153 --> 02:43.318
ALL: Hey.

02:43.404 --> 02:45.287
Wow. I...

02:45.372 --> 02:47.456
I-I... Like, I-I
can't help but feel

02:47.541 --> 02:50.292
like I'm the only single
person here tonight.

02:50.377 --> 02:52.244
- (knocking)
- Hmm. Interesting.

02:52.296 --> 02:53.962
What? Wait, what-what's happening?

02:54.048 --> 02:56.081
Why-why are you being mysterious?

02:56.133 --> 02:58.550
- It's... Maude! Hi!
- Hi!

02:58.586 --> 03:01.253
You look pretty, you look so pretty.

03:01.338 --> 03:02.671
Thank you, thank you.

03:02.756 --> 03:04.339
(clears throat) This is... this is Josh,

03:04.425 --> 03:08.010
my brother I was telling
you... I was telling you about.

03:08.095 --> 03:10.646
You told her...

03:10.731 --> 03:13.816
Don't mind me. (chuckles)

03:16.203 --> 03:18.303
- So, how do you know Liz?
- Um,

03:18.339 --> 03:20.772
- we work together.
- Oh.

03:20.858 --> 03:22.491
D...

03:22.576 --> 03:23.859
(overlapping intrusive questioning)

03:23.944 --> 03:25.661
You love her, right?

03:25.746 --> 03:27.246
I know you like her.
You should be dating her.

03:27.281 --> 03:28.747
(questioning continues)

03:28.782 --> 03:29.615
(grunts)

03:29.667 --> 03:30.582
Here's your seat.

03:30.618 --> 03:31.783
It's just one seat.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.002
You guys seem pretty cozy over there.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.738
KURT: Yeah, it's like, "Slow it down,

03:35.823 --> 03:38.006
- you two."
- (laughter)

03:44.065 --> 03:46.465
- Oh.
- Leo,

03:46.550 --> 03:49.935
would you join me in the
kitchen to help me with the food?

03:49.970 --> 03:51.720
LEO: Oh. Of course.

03:51.805 --> 03:52.471
Xander,

03:52.523 --> 03:53.805
would you join me

03:53.858 --> 03:55.057
in the living room to get some

03:55.142 --> 03:57.476
of the, um, other foods?

03:57.528 --> 03:59.194
Of course.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.146
Tam, would you join me in the bathroom

04:01.232 --> 04:04.149
to help me with
the-the-the-the...

04:04.235 --> 04:06.235
I know what you guys
are trying to do, so...

04:06.320 --> 04:08.620
the helping me to shit?

04:08.656 --> 04:10.155
Of course.

04:10.207 --> 04:11.823
- My God.
- KURT: And, uh,

04:11.909 --> 04:14.409
we'll leave you two alone.

04:14.495 --> 04:17.411
The hell?

04:17.498 --> 04:19.665
- Okay.
- (chuckles)

04:22.887 --> 04:24.836
Do you like salad?

04:24.922 --> 04:28.674
Uh, y-yeah. I guess.

04:28.759 --> 04:30.342
(whispering): Oh, my God, they
both like salad. It's working out.

04:30.427 --> 04:32.177
What are the odds that
they both like salad?

04:32.263 --> 04:34.897
- Oh, my God.
- I knew they had so much in common.

04:34.982 --> 04:36.348
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.066
Oh, they look so good
together, they look so good.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.819
I think that's everyone that was just here.

04:40.854 --> 04:42.521
- They're on to us.
- I hope, I hope he kisses her.

04:42.606 --> 04:43.989
Seal the deal, Josh.

04:44.024 --> 04:47.693
- (whispering continues)
- Um, so, uh...

04:47.778 --> 04:51.747
You-you a fan of, um, movies?

04:51.832 --> 04:53.782
(grunting) Oh, my God!

04:54.986 --> 04:56.585
Enough small talk!

04:56.670 --> 04:58.525
We've given you plenty of time.

04:58.739 --> 04:59.955
And now...

05:00.040 --> 05:01.840
you must join us.

No.

- Holy shit.
- Mm-hmm.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.148
That dinner was so awkward.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.767
That was, like, a lot of pressure.

Yeah, well, that-that...
Welcome to my life.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.275
Why do I need to settle down?

06:18.277 --> 06:20.786
What's wrong with being
young and just messing around?

06:20.871 --> 06:22.587
- That's... Exactly.

Well, uh, they're giving
me a bit more to do at work.

07:02.246 --> 07:04.363

- Oh.

07:04.449 --> 07:05.581
bit of a step up.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.916
Anything else?

07:07.001 --> 07:10.202
Maybe something about a young lady?

- Well, Liz

07:13.007 --> 07:15.291
told me you really hit it off with Maude

07:15.376 --> 07:17.009
at the dinner.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.929
Mom, it's really... it's not a big deal.

07:20.014 --> 07:21.213
- Not a big deal?
- No.

07:21.265 --> 07:23.549
My son's new girlfriend

07:23.601 --> 07:27.269
- is not a big deal?
- She's not my girlfriend. She's not...

07:27.355 --> 07:29.555
- (stammers)
- We... I don't really want

07:29.607 --> 07:31.390
- to talk about it.
- Okay, I get it.

07:31.442 --> 07:34.727
- Mom's always the last to know.
- There's nothing to know.

07:34.812 --> 07:36.612
But I will say

07:36.698 --> 07:40.199
I look forward to meeting the elusive Maude

07:40.234 --> 07:42.651
whenever the time is right.

07:42.737 --> 07:45.571
- Thank you. Thank you, Mom.
- Here, have some iced tea.

07:45.623 --> 07:47.406
- I'm okay.
- No, it's very good.

07:47.492 --> 07:48.741
It's got mint in it.

07:48.826 --> 07:49.992
- All right.
- It's got mint in it.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.494
Yeah, okay. You keep saying that

07:51.579 --> 07:52.995
- like it's a huge selling point.
- Go on.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.580
- Drink it up.
- Okay.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.250
Mmm.

07:58.302 --> 07:59.552
Ugh.

07:59.587 --> 08:02.054
It, um, tastes kind of bitter.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.556
- Yeah.
- There's a bit of a, uh...

08:03.591 --> 08:06.008

08:30.785 --> 08:32.333
Hello, Joshie.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.863
- Mom?
- We tried this

08:33.865 --> 08:35.203
the easy way.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.659
You didn't want to cooperate.

08:37.660 --> 08:38.794
So now

08:38.797 --> 08:41.710
we're gonna do it the hard way.

08:41.796 --> 08:44.046
Last chance.

08:44.131 --> 08:46.031
- Tell me about Maude.
- Th-There's

08:46.067 --> 08:47.466
really nothing to tell.

08:47.552 --> 08:49.385
No, no, no, no! (shouting)

08:50.555 --> 08:52.888
(moaning)

08:52.974 --> 08:55.357
- That was a two.
- (groans)

08:55.443 --> 08:56.743
You don't want to find out

08:56.745 --> 08:58.778
what a ten feels like.

08:58.813 --> 09:00.735
Now, you are gonna

09:00.737 --> 09:04.228
tell me every last detail about you

09:04.230 --> 09:05.901
and this new girl

09:05.987 --> 09:08.645
you're seeing. But first

09:08.647 --> 09:10.227
how are you in the chair?

09:10.229 --> 09:12.241
- Are you comfortable there?
- What?

09:12.326 --> 09:13.993
No, is your back supported?

09:14.078 --> 09:15.377
- K-Kind of.
- Okay.

09:15.463 --> 09:17.997
No, no, no! (shouting)

09:18.082 --> 09:20.166
Back to Maude.

09:20.218 --> 09:23.252
I want information now.

09:23.337 --> 09:26.005
Okay, okay. We-we just hooked up

09:26.057 --> 09:27.673
a few times. I swear. That's it.

09:27.725 --> 09:29.391
Well, what does "hooking up" mean?

09:29.477 --> 09:32.311
- Is it kissing? Sex?
- Oh, God.

09:32.346 --> 09:33.762
- Something else?
- (stammers) I don't know. I don't know.

09:33.848 --> 09:35.931
It can mean a lot of different things.

09:36.017 --> 09:37.349
What about dating?

09:37.435 --> 09:40.121
I read in a magazine that young people

09:40.123 --> 09:42.021
all just go out in groups now.

09:42.073 --> 09:43.446
Is that true?

09:43.448 --> 09:44.657
Is it all groups now?!

09:44.692 --> 09:45.858
What are you talking about?!

09:45.910 --> 09:48.694
(shouting)

09:48.746 --> 09:51.197
(panting)

09:51.249 --> 09:52.615
Where am I?!

09:52.700 --> 09:54.250
Oh, this is your old bedroom, sweetie.

09:54.335 --> 09:55.367
I turned it

09:55.419 --> 09:57.636
- into a torture chamber.
- Come on.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.872
- You changed my room without asking me?
- Well,

09:59.924 --> 10:01.792
it wasn't like you were using it.

10:01.794 --> 10:03.542
Maybe if you came to visit more!

10:03.594 --> 10:05.544
(shouting)

10:05.596 --> 10:07.296
Back to Maude.

10:07.381 --> 10:08.848
When can I meet her?

10:08.883 --> 10:10.132
(mumbling): Go to hell.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.300
What did you say?

10:11.385 --> 10:12.768
Go to hell.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.573
- What did you say?
- I said

10:14.575 --> 10:16.722
go to hell, Mom!

10:16.774 --> 10:18.974
Oh, wrong answer.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.360
(shouting)

10:21.395 --> 10:22.561
(static)

10:24.448 --> 10:25.614
Hey, hon?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.733
The TV's on the fritz!

10:27.818 --> 10:29.318
PATTI: I'm torturing Josh!

10:29.403 --> 10:30.569
Oh.

10:30.621 --> 10:32.037
Hi, Josh!

10:32.073 --> 10:33.205
JOSH: Hi, Tom.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.041
You are one tough cookie.

10:36.077 --> 10:37.877
But...

10:37.912 --> 10:41.071
I have a secret weapon:

10:41.683 --> 10:43.649
My Dell.

10:43.701 --> 10:45.500
You still have that thing?

10:46.754 --> 10:49.588
Now, tell me how to sign onto Facebook

10:49.640 --> 10:50.890
and show me Maude.

10:50.925 --> 10:52.675
(laughing)

10:57.398 --> 10:59.481
Oh, I'd like to, Mom. I really would.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.267
Only one slight problem:

11:01.319 --> 11:04.103
Maude and I are so not a thing,

11:04.188 --> 11:06.599
I'm not even Facebook friends with her.

11:06.601 --> 11:07.740
(sighs)

11:07.775 --> 11:09.108
(laughing)

11:10.026 --> 11:11.544
But I am.

11:11.862 --> 11:12.945
Liz.

11:13.030 --> 11:13.598
LIZ: Hope you don't mind me

11:13.600 --> 11:15.364
just dropping in like this.

11:15.449 --> 11:17.082
You piece of shit.

11:17.118 --> 11:19.084
Mmm.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.953
- Mom's lentil soup.
- Ugh!

11:21.038 --> 11:23.088
- Oh... no!
- Hi, Mom.

11:23.124 --> 11:24.540
PATTI: There's my girl!

11:24.625 --> 11:26.342
Let's get you in here.

11:26.427 --> 11:29.128
Logging into my account...

11:29.180 --> 11:31.046
M-A-U-D-E.

11:31.132 --> 11:32.298
Maude Metzger.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.466
Metzger?

11:34.518 --> 11:36.268
Oh, she's a doll!

11:36.304 --> 11:37.386
Get away from her profile!

11:37.471 --> 11:39.271
Ooh, she's as cute as a button!

11:39.307 --> 11:40.389
Just don't look at her profile!

11:40.474 --> 11:41.440
PATTI: Ooh, she grew up

11:41.475 --> 11:42.725
in Northbrook!

11:42.810 --> 11:44.360
Does she know the Stevensons?

11:44.445 --> 11:45.477
Do they know each other?

11:45.563 --> 11:47.363
Do they all know each other?

11:47.448 --> 11:48.981
(sobbing): I don't know.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.282
"Dear Maude..."

11:50.318 --> 11:51.784
No...

11:51.819 --> 11:53.652
"This is Josh's mother

11:53.738 --> 11:55.821
- via the Internet."
- No, don't do that!

11:55.873 --> 11:58.657
"I can't wait

11:58.743 --> 12:00.125
to meet you!"

12:00.161 --> 12:01.493
Please don't.

12:01.545 --> 12:02.995
It's really not that
serious; we just started

12:03.047 --> 12:04.463
- hanging out.
- Now, to send.

12:04.498 --> 12:06.215
Don't do it, please.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.890
Leo proposed to Liz!

12:14.976 --> 12:16.508
What?!

12:16.560 --> 12:17.476
- Yeah.
- LIZ: He's lying.

12:17.511 --> 12:18.594
Don't listen to him.

12:18.679 --> 12:20.729
Got her a ring. Secret ring.

12:20.815 --> 12:22.014
Do not listen to him!

12:22.066 --> 12:23.682
No, he-he did. He...

12:23.734 --> 12:24.850
It was romantic but secret.

12:24.935 --> 12:26.101
- (chuckles)
- No...

12:26.187 --> 12:27.353
Wedding.

12:27.405 --> 12:28.320
He's lying!

12:28.356 --> 12:30.239
Big ring. Big everything.

12:30.324 --> 12:32.274
I'm your little girl.
Would I never not tell you?

12:32.360 --> 12:33.692
- Oh, God, she's got the look.
- Wedding.

12:33.778 --> 12:34.693
- JOSH: Yeah.
- LIZ: Oh, God, it's the look.

12:34.745 --> 12:36.612
No. Josh...

12:36.697 --> 12:38.530
It's not for at least
two, two and a half years.

12:38.582 --> 12:40.699
No, Mom, no!

12:42.169 --> 12:43.669
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

12:43.704 --> 12:45.004
(Liz screams in distance)

12:45.039 --> 12:46.705
- Hey, Joshie.
- Hi.

12:46.757 --> 12:49.508
So your mother tells me
you've got a new lady friend.

12:49.543 --> 12:51.677
Yeah, I-I don't really want to
talk about it that much, so...

12:51.712 --> 12:53.045
Neato.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.214
Yeah, okay.

12:55.299 --> 12:56.515
- PATTI: When can we go dress shopping?
- Oh, birdie!

12:56.550 --> 12:58.931
- And taste cakes?
- LIZ: No!

12:59.776 --> 13:01.375
(animal noises)

13:01.461 --> 13:02.594
Yo, dude. You want to do

13:02.596 --> 13:04.795
a bunch of mushrooms and go to the zoo?

13:04.881 --> 13:07.498
Ah, man, I would, but I got a booty call.

13:07.583 --> 13:08.916
Oh, nice.

13:08.968 --> 13:10.468
(laughing, singsongy): Booty call.

13:10.553 --> 13:12.253
- Mm-mm-mm...
- Maude and I

13:12.305 --> 13:14.472
are going out to dinner with
her cousins and their husbands,

13:14.557 --> 13:16.090
after which the whole group of us

13:16.175 --> 13:18.426
are going to this little
out-of-the-way gelato place

13:18.511 --> 13:20.061
that's meant to be impossibly cute.

13:20.096 --> 13:21.679
After that, Maude and I

13:21.764 --> 13:24.561
split off from the herd,
go to an improv show,

13:24.563 --> 13:26.650
and then it's booty time.

13:27.904 --> 13:29.737
Josh, uh...

13:29.772 --> 13:30.509
You know the difference

13:30.511 --> 13:33.607
between a booty call and a date, right?

13:33.693 --> 13:36.327
Yeah.

13:36.412 --> 13:38.279
(weakly): Oh, yeah...

13:38.364 --> 13:40.381
Yeah?

13:40.450 --> 13:41.782
This is a date, isn't it?

13:41.868 --> 13:43.033
Oh, my God.

13:43.119 --> 13:44.752
Oh, man,

13:44.787 --> 13:47.538
how did this get so serious?

13:47.623 --> 13:48.871
- Wow, that was so funny.
- Yeah.

13:48.873 --> 13:51.759
Like, I'm going to start
going to improv all the time.

13:51.794 --> 13:53.210
Because that was so funny.

13:53.212 --> 13:55.229
- Wasn't that funny? Right?
- Uh...

13:55.265 --> 13:57.932
I mean, they must have
secret scripts somewhere.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.767
Like, do you think that that...

13:59.802 --> 14:02.303
that guy that yelled out
"lettuce" was a plant?

14:02.355 --> 14:04.105
Because that lettuce stuff was so funny.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.357
Yeah, I don't... I don't, uh, I don't know.

14:06.442 --> 14:07.975
- Yeah.
- (laughing)

14:08.060 --> 14:10.144
Do you want to take a cab back to my place?

14:10.196 --> 14:12.563
Uh, I'm really tired tonight

14:12.648 --> 14:14.899
and I have to work tomorrow.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.484
Maybe we should hang out this weekend?

14:16.536 --> 14:18.652
(gasps) We can go see that show again!

14:18.738 --> 14:20.321
And see if the same
guy yells out "lettuce."

14:20.406 --> 14:22.289
(laughing nervously): Oh, shit...

14:22.325 --> 14:23.240
- (laughs)
- Uh...

14:23.326 --> 14:24.825
Maude, I gotta,

14:24.877 --> 14:26.794
I gotta... say something.

14:26.829 --> 14:28.879
- Yeah?
- I-I, uh... I don't...

14:28.965 --> 14:31.499
don't know that I'm feeling...

14:31.584 --> 14:34.084
uh, don't know if we should keep...

14:34.170 --> 14:36.804
- I've been so stressed...
- Josh.

14:36.839 --> 14:38.721
I understand completely.

14:39.142 --> 14:40.307
We have to get out of the city!

14:40.343 --> 14:42.009
Did someone say "camping trip"?

14:42.094 --> 14:43.477
- No, not... not at all.
- Yes!

14:43.513 --> 14:45.879
Oh, my gosh, Josh, this
is such a perfect idea

14:45.965 --> 14:47.314
because it was my friend Jenn's birthday

14:47.350 --> 14:48.849
and we were already talking about camping

14:48.935 --> 14:50.734
and her boyfriend/fiancé

14:50.820 --> 14:53.938
knows how to play almost
every Train song on the guitar

14:54.023 --> 14:55.272
and I don't want to brag

14:55.358 --> 14:57.858
but I have the most amazing voice,

14:57.944 --> 15:01.695
and this is just gonna
be an epic sing-along.

15:01.781 --> 15:03.330
How do I get out of this?

15:03.366 --> 15:05.699
- Uh, just stop texting her.
- What?

15:05.751 --> 15:07.418
Just never text her again.

15:07.503 --> 15:10.538
I mean, that seems,
like... kind of sketchy.

15:10.623 --> 15:12.006
- Are you and her a couple?
- No,

15:12.041 --> 15:14.458
but I know her cousins now.

15:14.544 --> 15:15.926
Have you used any of these terms:

15:16.012 --> 15:18.846
boyfriend, girlfriend,
relationship, exclusive?

15:18.881 --> 15:20.264
None of those.

15:20.349 --> 15:21.382
Then you don't owe her anything.

15:21.434 --> 15:22.683
Huh.

15:22.718 --> 15:25.219
I... I think you might be right.

15:25.304 --> 15:26.687
- I know I'm right.
- Wow.

15:26.722 --> 15:27.721
Thanks for this.

15:27.773 --> 15:28.973
Mm-hmm.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.891
(phone buzzing)

15:31.234 --> 15:32.775
_

15:34.363 --> 15:37.231
She just texted a... kind of a joke.

15:37.283 --> 15:38.966
I guess I have to reply "LOL."

15:38.968 --> 15:40.734
No! Don't respond to anything, okay?

15:40.786 --> 15:41.937
Just stay the course.

15:41.939 --> 15:44.205
When she sees you're not
responding, she'll get it.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.313
Okay.

16:09.398 --> 16:10.931
I think they've subsided. I...

16:10.983 --> 16:12.766
I think maybe she gets it.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.134
(knocking at door)

16:15.354 --> 16:16.737
MAUDE: Josh, are you in there?

16:16.772 --> 16:18.739
Shit!

16:18.791 --> 16:20.557
MAUDE: I didn't know
if you wanted a sun hat

16:20.643 --> 16:22.559
or a visor, so I got both.

16:22.645 --> 16:24.445
Don't worry about it. I got you, bro.

16:24.497 --> 16:26.280
- MAUDE: Josh? Open the door.
- Take this dram.

16:26.332 --> 16:28.449
- Take this what?
- Dram. I got it at the apothecary

16:28.534 --> 16:30.367
- next to the Jamba Juice.
- (knocking at door)

16:30.453 --> 16:31.785
MAUDE: Josh? Can I come in?

16:31.837 --> 16:32.870
What-what... what does it do?

16:32.955 --> 16:34.421
It lets you fake your own death.

16:34.457 --> 16:36.340
Yeah. Turns you pale, stops your pulse.

16:36.425 --> 16:38.175
When she sees your corpse, she will get it.

16:38.261 --> 16:40.511
I don't know. It seems kind of sketchy.

16:40.596 --> 16:42.630
MAUDE: I brought a
tambourine for the sing-along!

16:42.715 --> 16:44.465
- Man...
- Yeah.

16:44.550 --> 16:45.215
- Hey, uh...
- MAUDE: Hey, Josh?

16:45.301 --> 16:47.635
Whoa. That's, uh...

16:47.687 --> 16:49.136
there's a smell to it.

16:49.221 --> 16:50.137
Yeah. It's gross.

16:50.189 --> 16:51.021
- Yep.
- Yep.

16:51.107 --> 16:52.856
Down the hatch.

16:52.942 --> 16:53.974
(gurgling): Oh, wow...

16:54.026 --> 16:54.858
Ugh...

16:54.944 --> 16:57.011
Coriander...

16:57.079 --> 16:58.479
Yeah... oh.

16:58.531 --> 17:00.481
He's dead.

17:00.566 --> 17:02.695
My friend is dead!

- This was a very,

17:33.883 --> 17:35.164
very bad idea. Do you know what it's like,

17:35.166 --> 17:38.052
- waking up in a coffin?
- Hey, just stay the course, bro.

He wasn't a wealthy man

18:19.929 --> 18:23.427
or interesting...

18:24.934 --> 18:25.733
or cool.

18:25.768 --> 18:27.267
What the...?

18:27.319 --> 18:29.603
(crying): But he was
a really good brother...

18:29.655 --> 18:31.105
(laughs)

18:31.140 --> 18:32.324
and a wonderful son

18:32.326 --> 18:35.615
and a wonderful boyfriend to Maude.

18:36.762 --> 18:38.245
I love you, Joshie.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.781
Please light the pyre.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.504
What pyre?

18:43.836 --> 18:45.085
A gentleman

18:45.121 --> 18:47.004
is now an angel.

18:48.841 --> 18:50.290
Uh...

18:52.344 --> 18:53.127
What the...?

18:56.632 --> 18:58.549
This is gonna be super awkward.

18:58.634 --> 18:59.717
Oh, man.

19:02.972 --> 19:04.388
- Oh!
- (guests screaming)

19:05.641 --> 19:06.690
Aah!

19:08.978 --> 19:09.943
Josh!

19:13.315 --> 19:14.481
Whew!

19:14.567 --> 19:15.482
(screams)

19:15.568 --> 19:17.735
Oh, dear God.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.787
It's, uh...

19:19.822 --> 19:21.989
it's not a bad turnout, I guess.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.457
Hi, gang.

19:23.492 --> 19:25.459
I have something to say.

19:25.494 --> 19:28.495
Uh... Maude, I don't think

19:28.581 --> 19:30.130
we should go camping this weekend.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.832
Or... or... or any weekend.

19:31.884 --> 19:33.584
Um... it's...

19:33.669 --> 19:34.138
I just don't think

19:34.140 --> 19:36.637
we're right for each other.

19:36.672 --> 19:39.006
Okay.

19:39.091 --> 19:40.894
Why didn't you just tell me that?

19:42.678 --> 19:44.144
I-I don't know.

19:45.848 --> 19:48.182
You're kind of sketchy.

19:49.636 --> 19:53.403
I am very disappointed in you, Joshie.

19:53.489 --> 19:56.273
I expected a lot more.

19:56.358 --> 19:57.491
So did I.

19:57.526 --> 19:58.492
So did I.

19:58.527 --> 19:59.526
Oh, for...

20:02.414 --> 20:03.997
Uh, thank-thanks, Tom.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.866
Very immature.

20:05.951 --> 20:07.918
You put "temp" on there?

20:10.372 --> 20:12.039
So, uh, dude,

20:12.091 --> 20:13.760
I wasn't quite sure when to bring this up,

20:13.762 --> 20:17.371
but, uh, you owe me 30 bucks for that dram.

20:24.587 --> 20:26.303
Uh, you know what?

20:26.388 --> 20:28.522
It's cool, man. This one's on me.

20:28.557 --> 20:30.474
Oh. Good.
