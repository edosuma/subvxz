- Where?

21:36.947 --> 21:39.428
- Tijuana, Mexico.
By the border.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.865
- What's he doing there?

cross into the states,

21:46.174 --> 21:48.089
we've got to get to him first.

- Not really.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.068
- What does that mean?

25:48.111 --> 25:50.940
- Means you made a mess
of things down in Bolivia.

Three dead cops.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.857
Chief of Police,
for Christ's sake.

25:56.990 --> 26:00.776

They had to die.

Well, I'm gonna have

you're a difficult asset

26:25.409 --> 26:27.629

Subtlety is no longer
your strong suit.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.591
Wanna tell me what's
going on, John?

26:32.634 --> 26:35.028
- I'm the best solo asset
you've got and you know it.

51:58.071 --> 51:59.116
- Who was the guy?

52:00.769 --> 52:04.991
- Edgar...Edgar some--something.
I don't remember.

52:08.690 --> 52:09.474
- Edgar Mann.

52:18.918 --> 52:21.834
This yours?
- Yeah.

52:21.877 --> 52:22.878
- Unlock it.

52:28.406 --> 52:29.929
- So...so you know him, right?

52:32.018 --> 52:36.283
- Yeah. We've met. So
how did he contact you?

52:38.024 --> 52:39.156
- Baysanos Bar.

52:39.199 --> 52:40.244
He has people that work there.

52:43.464 --> 52:44.900
So you guys are cool, right?

52:53.953 --> 52:55.302
Right, you guys are cool?

52:56.608 --> 52:57.304
You guys are friends?

52:59.001 --> 52:59.741
- Actually, no.

53:01.830 --> 53:06.400
[muffled cry]
[gun fired]

53:33.079 --> 53:35.386

[groans]

53:51.271 --> 53:54.013
[rapid gun fire]

53:55.884 --> 53:57.799
- I...I can pay you.

53:57.843 --> 53:59.236
I--I--I have money.

54:00.672 --> 54:02.108
Please, please, please.

54:03.849 --> 54:05.459
I beg. I beg.

54:05.503 --> 54:05.851
Please, please don't shoot
me. I can pay. Please.

54:10.682 --> 54:11.596
- Get down.

54:13.337 --> 54:15.034
- Please.
- Get down!

54:16.557 --> 54:21.258
- Please. [Rousseau
speaking in French]

54:35.054 --> 54:36.403
- Are you married?

54:40.364 --> 54:41.626
Are you married?!

55:01.341 --> 55:05.824
[Rousseau speaking in French]

55:05.867 --> 55:06.651
- She's dead.

55:08.174 --> 55:13.179
And the lady, break failure.

55:15.442 --> 55:18.315
The car company said
it was 'driver error.'

55:22.493 --> 55:26.105
Bullshit. Manufacturing defect.

55:27.933 --> 55:29.630
I hacked into the
file to prove it.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.939
That is what they do, you see.

55:35.462 --> 55:36.942
They make as much
money as possible.

55:36.985 --> 55:38.509
And fuck you if
you're in the way.

55:40.772 --> 55:42.121
There is no accountability.

55:44.776 --> 55:46.386
The government,
they are pussies.

55:48.910 --> 55:49.737
It is why I do.

55:51.522 --> 55:54.568
I fill the void when
they are murderers.

55:57.876 --> 55:59.094
I hold up the mirror.

56:05.797 --> 56:10.497
[sniffles] It was three
years ago when they died.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.939
Maybe... it is over.

56:26.165 --> 56:27.775
Maybe now it is finished.

56:37.829 --> 56:38.612
- Get in the car.

[sniffling]

[car door closes]

57:20.480 --> 57:22.787
- What's this all about anyways?

57:26.051 --> 57:26.573
- Silver.

57:28.096 --> 57:31.622
He behaves like a
king but he's a thug.

57:31.665 --> 57:35.234
He has built an empire
but with mob connections

57:35.277 --> 57:39.586
and insider trading,
anything crooked.

57:39.630 --> 57:43.285
But he's stupid and greedy.

57:45.157 --> 57:49.857
Now, all his holdings are
only worth something on paper.

57:52.512 --> 57:54.122
- Yeah.

57:54.166 --> 57:56.255
- And he plans on selling it
all to the highest bidder.

57:56.298 --> 57:57.125
- Exact demo.

57:59.127 --> 58:00.259
He did is toxic.

58:01.782 --> 58:05.699
So I use some leverage
on one of his guys inside

58:05.743 --> 58:09.181
using some of
Silver's own money.

58:09.224 --> 58:13.925
And I've got some data that
explains exactly how much

58:15.100 --> 58:17.102
in the red he actually is.

58:17.145 --> 58:19.757
I encrypted it and I
hid it on the internet.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.454
Now he wants his data back.

58:22.586 --> 58:24.979
- And you can decrypt this data?

58:25.023 --> 58:27.895
- Oh, yeah. Not a problem.

58:27.939 --> 58:29.375
- How?

58:29.418 --> 58:31.899
- Using codes in my head.

58:38.558 --> 58:40.691
- [John] So how much
are you paying Sykes?

58:41.953 --> 58:42.736
- 100 grand.

58:44.825 --> 58:48.176
- You've got a million-dollar
purse on your head.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.264
How long do you
think she was going

58:49.308 --> 58:50.657
to pretend to protect you?

58:59.057 --> 59:00.885
- Okay. What is your plan?

59:02.843 --> 59:05.019
- Get to the border.

59:05.063 --> 59:07.413
I'll get you to the U.S.
Marshals in San Diego.

59:08.327 --> 59:09.546
They can protect you.

59:11.069 --> 59:12.374
- Thank you for not shooting me

59:12.418 --> 59:15.029
but I don't want
to be prosecuted.

59:15.073 --> 59:18.163
- You got a much better chance
of making your case in court

59:18.206 --> 59:20.600
than you do out here.

59:20.644 --> 59:23.908
Do you have any idea how
many hitmen are after you?

59:23.951 --> 59:26.911

to kills for him.

- Yeah, like gloves.
Funny accent.

- So Henrik Botha from
London. You know him?

59:38.183 --> 59:38.966
- I used to.

am I going to go, huh?

- Just look natural.
I'll be back.

- What?

- Did Sykes put a GPS
tracker in the car?

- I don't know. It is possible.

wasn't such a good idea.

There's too many operators.
Too many variables.

detail contacted us yet?

she'll make the exchange.

make you a rich man, Henrik.

- I lost him.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.311
- Lost him? I thought
you were gonna kill him.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.703
- Yeah.

01:11:56.747 --> 01:11:59.489
About that, we're taking
the Marshall's bounty.

- [Mann] That's a
fraction as much?!

- We're taking it.

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.496
- I told you to 'be subtle.'

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.280
Not 'go soft.'

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.412
But look, I'm glad you called.

01:12:10.978 --> 01:12:12.458
There's been a wrinkle.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:15.896
It seems that Rousseau has
held on to some of the codes

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.551
to decrypt the data that
he stole from Silver.

01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:20.074
And now Silver wants it back.

01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:23.382
- So I've heard.

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:26.733
Sykes must be holding
Rousseau for a ransom.

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.735
That's why she didn't just
put a bullet in his head

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:30.650
when she had the chance.
- Yeah.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:33.740
And I don't think he's
gonna be willing to pay her.

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.786
- He may think we have
the codes at this point.

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:38.310
Are you safe?

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.137
- Am I safe?

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.922
[laughs] I'm an enigma.

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:43.576
I'm a mystery.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.535
I'm the fucking needle
in the haystack, baby.

01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:47.275
Nobody can find me.

01:12:47.319 --> 01:12:49.843
- [John] Yeah. Yeah.
How do I find Rousseau?

01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:52.542
- I don't think that's
gonna be too hard.

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:54.718
I've been looking
at his website.

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:58.112
I think he took him to the
De La Rosa development.

01:12:58.156 --> 01:12:59.331
It's private.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.114
It's one of those developments.

01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:01.115
It isn't finished.

01:13:01.159 --> 01:13:02.334
Never gonna be finished.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.205
But he's got a
million-dollar view.

01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:07.905
It's a great place to hide
out and issue ransom demands.

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.211
I think he posted something
with his smartphone trying

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:11.822
to send us a message.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:14.302
But look, there's something
more you should know.

01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:15.565
Where are you right now?

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:21.179
- At the Dead Drop.

01:13:22.876 --> 01:13:25.662

01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:27.272
Listen to me very carefully.

01:13:27.315 --> 01:13:30.231
I want you to get up and I want
you to get out of that bar.

01:13:30.275 --> 01:13:31.885
Do you understand me?

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:34.671
Silver has widened the
contract to anybody associated

01:13:34.714 --> 01:13:35.889
with this job.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:37.891
He's burning the whole project.

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.850
He's gonna fill your
lap with locals.

01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:42.592
He's sending in an enforcer
after Sykes and Rousseau.
