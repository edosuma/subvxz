<i>Bill and Marty here in
the middle of another</i>

00:56.955 --> 01:00.008
<i>Fourth of July weekend
Shock Jock Talk Block.</i>

01:00.043 --> 01:05.007
<i>All weekend long, we'll be counting down
the top 500 wacky sound effects of all time.</i>

01:05.042 --> 01:06.723
<i>And here is #499.</i>

01:06.758 --> 01:10.058
<i>Where were you when you first heard this?</i>

01:10.093 --> 01:13.860
<i>I'll tell you where I was. I was out eating....</i>

01:13.895 --> 01:15.669
<i>I think I had kung pao...</i>

01:15.704 --> 01:17.898
<i>and I ended up on the...</i>

01:18.963 --> 01:21.028
I can't listen to this anymore.

01:22.592 --> 01:24.574
Nobody shuts out my blather!

01:29.989 --> 01:32.457
Homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.459
They don't look like
the stabby kind.

01:34.494 --> 01:37.921
Mom, you said all hitchhikers
were drug-crazed thrill-seekers.

01:37.956 --> 01:43.468
I said they were thrill-crazed drug-seekers.
Don't put words in my mouth.

01:44.769 --> 01:46.435
Thanks for stopping.

01:47.704 --> 01:51.016
This is my girlfriend, Beatrice.

01:53.962 --> 01:56.131
Aw... young love.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.616
Were we ever that stupid?

01:59.651 --> 02:01.861
Of course we were.

02:03.113 --> 02:05.740
TWENTY YEARS EARLIER

02:06.418 --> 02:09.222
Marge, I thought of a new thing.
It's called "biking out."

02:09.257 --> 02:11.605
It's a combination of
biking and making out.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.885
I don't know.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.359
Come on. All the teens
on bikes are doing it.

02:27.567 --> 02:31.373
Howdy-do, strangers. Hop on in before
you become a couple runneth over.

02:31.408 --> 02:33.979
Ned, are you sure?
They're covered with mud.

02:34.014 --> 02:37.105
And in that mud, I'm planting
the seed of friendship.

02:38.087 --> 02:39.275
Name's Ned Flanders.

02:39.310 --> 02:42.110
As the elephant said to the peanut
vendor, toss those in my trunk.

02:42.145 --> 02:44.556
Marge, I love this guy.

02:44.591 --> 02:45.850
Put her there, muddy buddy.

02:45.885 --> 02:48.408
Oh, he rhymes! Oh, happy day.

02:50.153 --> 02:52.861
So, are you two engaged?
Engaged to be engaged?

02:52.896 --> 02:55.098
Well, we thought we'd
wait a little while.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.939
Really, not married?

02:56.974 --> 02:59.035
And you were bicycling two abreast?

02:59.070 --> 03:01.587
I wish. We were bicycling to a lake.

03:02.409 --> 03:04.105
Wordplay. Never cared for it.

03:04.140 --> 03:07.734
But it's never too soon for
you two to join the "I do" crew.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.137
Now, I'm not saying it's
all Jell-O with Cool Whip.

03:10.172 --> 03:12.071
She'll nag you. She'll try to change you.

03:12.106 --> 03:15.747
You'll be fighting the same basic
fight for years and years and years...

03:15.782 --> 03:18.438
Ned, don't you think you're
exaggerating just a bit?

03:18.473 --> 03:21.629
I think I'd like to finish my sentence.

03:21.664 --> 03:22.955
And years.

03:24.181 --> 03:25.898
Um, how longhave you two been married?

03:25.933 --> 03:28.949
Since 2:00 this afternoon.
Welcome to our honeymoon.

03:30.722 --> 03:34.424
Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?

03:34.459 --> 03:38.633
Homer Simpson, I would be
delighted not to marry you.

03:38.668 --> 03:41.956
Then, I now pronounce us just dating.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.354
I love kissing you.

03:46.389 --> 03:48.343
I never want to knock it off.

03:49.292 --> 03:53.022
Knock it off! How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings.

03:53.057 --> 03:55.376
Bart, don't you dare take
your eyes off that GameBoy.

03:55.411 --> 03:56.411
Yes, sir.

03:56.446 --> 03:57.769
CEREAL KILLER

03:58.050 --> 03:59.188
Avast, you!

04:05.755 --> 04:07.551
I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!

04:07.586 --> 04:10.985
Video games: the reason this
generation of Americans is

04:11.020 --> 04:12.283
the best ever.

04:13.848 --> 04:16.019
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS
THANKS FOR NOTHING

04:16.053 --> 04:18.225
GRAND OPENING

04:19.235 --> 04:20.235
FIVE YEARS EARLIER

04:20.269 --> 04:23.414
I can't believe Homer
ruined another family picnic.

04:23.449 --> 04:25.917
Hey, everybody pees in the pool.

04:25.952 --> 04:28.495
Not from the diving board.

04:28.530 --> 04:31.335
Why did we have to have
these two jerks along?

04:31.370 --> 04:33.108
You're driving too fast.

04:33.143 --> 04:35.732
- You're losing your hair.
- You sneeze like a girl.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.969
Your neck looks like a sideways ass.

04:38.004 --> 04:39.004
That's it!

04:40.818 --> 04:42.892
Eat gravel, hags!

04:42.927 --> 04:45.689
Homer, that was rude and shortsighted.

04:45.724 --> 04:49.347
- Patty and Selma have the map.
- I have the situation under control.

04:49.382 --> 04:51.410
The compass needle is pointing east.

04:51.445 --> 04:53.074
That's the fuel gauge.

04:55.450 --> 04:58.097
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

04:58.132 --> 04:59.881
You haven't said you're sorry.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.912
I know, I was hoping
the number might be zero.

05:09.589 --> 05:10.925
Can we use your phone?

05:10.960 --> 05:14.570
Of course, it's just past the
sushi bar, behind the limbo pit,

05:14.605 --> 05:16.479
right in front of the blackjack table.

05:16.514 --> 05:19.279
And feel free to stay. We just put out the cheese.

05:19.314 --> 05:21.554
We have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.749
and cubes of orange and yellow.

05:24.928 --> 05:28.735
A really fun party full of colored
cheeses and awesome stuff to do?

05:28.770 --> 05:31.603
Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge.

05:31.638 --> 05:34.288
We'll stay for one
hand roll or two nigiri.

05:34.323 --> 05:36.325
Then, we have to get back to the kids.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.120
Oh, let my dad enjoy
them a little longer.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.209
Stop!

05:45.261 --> 05:47.583
- Stop!
- Where are the cookies?

05:47.618 --> 05:49.837
- I don't remember.
- Wrong answer.

06:00.876 --> 06:02.271
Oh, for me?

06:02.306 --> 06:04.431
No, get two of your own.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.356
You're a funny one.

06:06.672 --> 06:09.418
That's strong. Are you
trying to get me drunk?

06:09.453 --> 06:11.707
No, I'm trying to get me drunk.

06:11.742 --> 06:15.628
You know, my horoscope said I'd
meet the man of my dreams tonight.

06:15.663 --> 06:19.429
Well, a horoscope would never
lie to a pretty girl like you.

06:19.464 --> 06:22.962
You are adorable.
Are you alone?

06:22.997 --> 06:25.078
No, I'm talking to you
at this great party.

06:25.113 --> 06:27.059
Well, then, would you like to limbo?

06:27.094 --> 06:30.767
Limbo? You mean the dance or that
place where unbaptized babies go?

06:30.802 --> 06:32.104
Either way, I'm in.

06:36.586 --> 06:38.971
# Every limbo boy and girl #

06:39.289 --> 06:41.557
# All around the something world #

06:42.086 --> 06:44.185
# Gonna do the limbo rock #

06:44.699 --> 06:46.896
# Something something limbo something #

06:48.368 --> 06:50.274
# Limbo lower now #

06:50.792 --> 06:53.194
# How low can you go? #

06:53.342 --> 06:55.374
That's how low you can go!

06:55.409 --> 06:57.662
Why are you dancing with that strange woman?

06:57.697 --> 06:59.707
She's not strange. She's fun.

06:59.742 --> 07:02.915
And she doesn't get jealous
when I talk to other women.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.424
Well, then, she can
have you all to herself!

07:13.401 --> 07:15.111
How about a sushi fight?

07:15.819 --> 07:17.177
Sushi fight!!

07:19.269 --> 07:21.121
These fish died for nothing!

07:25.019 --> 07:29.063
Homer Simpson,
I wish I'd never met you.

07:31.085 --> 07:34.929
TONGUE-KISS POINT

07:34.964 --> 07:36.334
Thanks for the lift.

07:36.369 --> 07:38.043
What a cute couple.

07:38.078 --> 07:41.779
She's gonna take him for a lot of money.

07:44.303 --> 07:45.413
Here we are.

07:48.686 --> 07:51.277
A log cabin? What am I, Davy Crockett?

07:51.312 --> 07:54.213
- Also, who's Davy Crockett?
- Kids, this place has

07:54.248 --> 07:56.674
very special memories
for your mother and me.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.549
Well, leaving right now will
become a special memory for me.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.900
They have a pedal car.

08:02.935 --> 08:06.597
- Pedal cars suck.
- They're worse than walking.

08:06.632 --> 08:10.061
I'll put 100 bucks in your college fund.

08:10.096 --> 08:12.328
I'll take ten bucks now.

08:12.363 --> 08:15.193
I'll steal it back when you're sleeping.

08:26.341 --> 08:28.178
Well, when the sun goes down, it means God's

08:28.213 --> 08:31.618
gone to China to watch
over those good folks.

08:31.653 --> 08:33.595
Time for some shut-eye.

08:33.630 --> 08:36.277
Why, Flanders, you rogue.

08:36.312 --> 08:41.082
All Marge and I need are a queen-sized
bed and a king-sized "do not disturb" sign.

08:43.548 --> 08:47.767
Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate
accommodations for you notly-weds.

08:47.802 --> 08:50.367
What? But I have urges.

08:50.402 --> 08:52.405
That's just your trouser devil talking.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.191
He's not talking. He's yelling.

08:58.823 --> 09:00.346
Good night, Marge.

09:05.474 --> 09:07.928
Sweet dreams, my new best friend.

09:14.525 --> 09:16.571
Oh, what better way to
celebrate our wedding night

09:16.606 --> 09:19.420
than by keeping an
unmarried couple apart.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.175
Oh, Maude.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.499
Your dead grandmother's pajamas.

09:25.534 --> 09:27.701
You know what that does to me.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.777
I never thought I'd say
this, but... stupid Flanders.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.712
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

09:42.747 --> 09:46.951
I'm in my own room, being
chaperoned by an actual Christian.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.379
Well, I just don't trust that Homer Simpson.

09:49.414 --> 09:53.612
He's that rare combination of up
to something and good for nothing.

09:54.742 --> 09:57.336
Good one. We should put that in the file.

09:57.371 --> 09:59.755
HOMER INSULTS

10:01.117 --> 10:02.117
Nice.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.901
Madame, perhaps I can
be of some assistance.

10:21.891 --> 10:26.726
But I can't take a dress from a man
who looks so good and smells so clean.

10:26.761 --> 10:30.269
Please... when you came through the
door tonight, I instantly imagined you

10:30.304 --> 10:33.776
in a ruched burgundy bias-cut
evening gown with a wolverine hem

10:33.811 --> 10:36.417
and a contrasting
cerise tulle décolletage.

10:36.986 --> 10:40.272
- Really, me? You did?
- Oh, yes, with a pair

10:40.307 --> 10:42.965
of saffron brocade diamond mink pumps.

10:44.699 --> 10:46.917
Pumps are shoes.

10:46.952 --> 10:48.596
That explains a lot.

10:53.192 --> 10:55.273
Marjorie, you look beautiful.

10:55.308 --> 10:57.054
Let me take you for a ride.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.231
Or, should I say, "glide"?

10:59.943 --> 11:01.953
I'm just happy you're talking again.

11:01.988 --> 11:04.791
You didn't say a word for 45 minutes.

11:13.185 --> 11:14.330
Marge?

11:14.365 --> 11:17.702
You don't need her, baby.
Sylvia's got everything you want.

11:17.737 --> 11:21.488
- Do you have a pineapple pizza?
- Pineapple and pepperoni.

11:21.523 --> 11:23.547
Oh. This is all going so fast.

11:25.607 --> 11:27.903
We should be getting back to the party.

11:27.938 --> 11:32.376
Marjorie, that party was beneath a woman of your elegance and sophistication.

11:32.411 --> 11:34.793
You... Oh, look, a budget motel!

11:40.137 --> 11:43.627
I see the word vacancy is lit, and the word no is not.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.598
Let us pray the no is not broken, huh?

11:50.309 --> 11:53.550
Alberto, I'm not sure if this is such a good idea.

11:54.085 --> 11:56.932
First we make love, then we
decide if it was a good idea.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.708
That's the European way.

12:06.145 --> 12:08.034
I came here once with Marge.

12:08.069 --> 12:10.147
Are you Marge, Sylvia?

12:10.182 --> 12:13.486
Homer, I can be whoever you want me to be.

12:18.273 --> 12:20.655
I want you to be Marge.

12:22.566 --> 12:23.566
Marge?!

12:25.643 --> 12:28.705
- Marge, is that you?
- My husband!

12:28.740 --> 12:31.400
Why do married women
always have husbands?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.639
Marge, what are you doing here?

12:39.003 --> 12:41.150
Uh, the same thing you're doing here.

12:41.185 --> 12:42.805
You better not be!

12:42.840 --> 12:44.357
I mean, great!

12:44.392 --> 12:47.132
We both came to rekindle
our precious memories

12:47.167 --> 12:49.751
of when we were young
and in love, right?

12:49.786 --> 12:53.643
We sure did. Rekindle, rekindle.
Okay, let's go.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.991
I have a better idea. Let's spend
the night together right here.

12:59.957 --> 13:04.456
Fine, but I don't want to sleep
in the same room with that chest.

13:04.491 --> 13:07.345
I feel the same way about that lamp.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.910
Okay, but first the chest.

13:10.945 --> 13:11.945
Okay.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.016
There you are!

13:17.051 --> 13:19.333
Homie, what's taking so long?

13:19.368 --> 13:21.686
Listen, you're a classy lady
and a great sushi fighter,

13:21.721 --> 13:23.813
but you're going in the box.

13:23.848 --> 13:26.544
- Homie?
- Coming, Marge!

13:38.976 --> 13:41.718
- Good evening. I am Alberto.
- Sylvia.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.767
Let's get out of this
chest and go have a drink.

13:43.802 --> 13:48.051
Actually, I am quite comfortable here.
There is a flask of cognac in my pocket.

13:48.086 --> 13:50.382
<i>- Do you think you can reach it?
- Okay.</i>

13:50.417 --> 13:52.099
<i>Uh, is this it?</i>

13:52.134 --> 13:54.290
<i>No, but don't stop twisting.</i>

13:55.927 --> 14:00.040
Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet...

14:00.955 --> 14:01.955
Kids?!

14:02.879 --> 14:06.904
I'm through baby-sitting
these monsters! Good night.

14:07.802 --> 14:11.413
- We won! He's asleep!
- And we'll stay up forever!

14:15.987 --> 14:18.455
Well, that takes care of those three.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.605
Want to go for a lakeside snuggle?

14:21.640 --> 14:24.393
Homer Simpson, you devil!

14:28.177 --> 14:30.761
Well, that takes care of those three.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.952
Want to go play some a lakeside snuggle?

14:33.987 --> 14:36.647
Homer Simpson, you devil!

14:37.770 --> 14:40.035
But I think we should unpack first.

14:42.372 --> 14:46.212
Hmm. All right. The trick is to ease them off.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.910
What is this dump?

14:56.945 --> 15:01.104
Ah, Ruthie, this dump is
where your mother and I met.

15:01.139 --> 15:03.767
It was a tale of betrayal, redemption,

15:03.802 --> 15:06.400
and a lovely continental breakfast.

15:08.296 --> 15:10.731
Homer, those are our wedding bungees!

15:13.856 --> 15:15.294
- Marjorie?!
- Homer?

15:15.329 --> 15:19.013
It's so good to see you. We
owe you two a debt of thanks.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.344
Homer, if I hadn't come
to this motel with you,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.078
I never would have met Alberto.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.283
And Marjorie, if you had
completed your seduction of me,

15:27.318 --> 15:29.468
I never would have met Sylvia.

15:30.648 --> 15:34.123
I can't believe one of the most
beautiful moments in our marriage

15:34.158 --> 15:36.247
is based on lies!

15:36.282 --> 15:38.085
You're just as bad as me!

15:38.120 --> 15:41.364
And you used to be better,
so that makes you worse!

15:41.399 --> 15:44.697
I don't think we can ever
trust each other again.

15:44.732 --> 15:47.479
Ruthie, kick me away
from this nightmare.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.514
Okay.

15:49.734 --> 15:52.366
I wish I'd never met you! Or you!

15:59.090 --> 16:01.079
Why can't you just admit we're lost?

16:01.114 --> 16:03.897
I'll tell you what's lost: your sense of adventure.

16:03.932 --> 16:06.160
Just ask those guys for directions.

16:06.576 --> 16:09.715
Hmm. Anti-nuclear activist
Dr. Helen Caldicott?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.324
Director Julie Taymor?

16:11.359 --> 16:14.251
- Do you love these women?
- They're okay, I guess.

16:14.286 --> 16:16.557
Let's just skip to the Windsor knot instructions.

16:16.592 --> 16:20.135
Excuse me, boys. My brother
is lost, and kind of a jerk.

16:20.170 --> 16:23.055
If he'd brought a map of
the grounds as I suggested,

16:23.090 --> 16:24.598
then we would...

16:24.787 --> 16:28.246
Lisa, do you know why I spend
every day after school in detention?

16:28.281 --> 16:30.262
So I don't have to come home to you!

16:30.297 --> 16:33.759
Oh, Bart, don't say things you can't take back.

16:33.794 --> 16:35.464
It's out there. Deal with it!

16:36.344 --> 16:38.604
Oh, great. Now you woke the baby.

16:38.639 --> 16:40.778
I told you we should have
left her with your mother!

16:40.813 --> 16:44.425
My God, Bart, what happened to us?

16:45.219 --> 16:46.459
We grew up.

16:51.251 --> 16:53.857
So, I'm sure you
missed Marge last night.

16:53.892 --> 16:56.624
Yeah. I missed her, like, five times.

16:56.659 --> 16:58.584
What a charming single entendre.

16:58.619 --> 17:01.661
Now, look, I know marriage is scary,
but if you really think she's the one,

17:01.696 --> 17:03.879
it gives you two a shot at forever.

17:03.914 --> 17:07.095
Forever? That would be awesome.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.403
Okay, here she comes. Why
don't you take Marge for a walk,

17:10.438 --> 17:12.477
open your heart and see what pours out?

17:12.512 --> 17:16.381
I suppose you and Maude will
be coming along, as well?

17:17.195 --> 17:21.633
Don't you think I got better things to
do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?

17:22.896 --> 17:26.084
Red Dog, this is Mustache One. We
have possible male/female interaction.

17:26.118 --> 17:29.005
Be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact.

17:31.562 --> 17:34.371
- Ready with the ice water.
- Lock onto his wiener.

17:34.406 --> 17:36.094
We have wiener-lock.

17:36.129 --> 17:39.068
Marge, when I'm with
you, I get that feeling

17:39.103 --> 17:42.548
like when I got that smart
kid's report card by mistake,

17:42.583 --> 17:46.223
and for a minute, I
thought I had all As,

17:46.258 --> 17:48.932
and that my namewas Howard Simberg.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.200
You make me feel that way, too.

17:51.235 --> 17:53.393
I know we'll get married some day,

17:53.428 --> 17:55.668
and to prove it, I'll
carve our names on this tree

17:55.703 --> 18:00.402
so all who are hopelessly
lost in the woods can see it.

18:01.523 --> 18:04.698
Oh, I hate other people's love.

18:15.217 --> 18:18.735
MARGE + HOME
4EVER

18:20.660 --> 18:23.566
So that wasn't Marge's glider

18:23.601 --> 18:26.010
parked outside the motel five years ago!

18:26.045 --> 18:29.139
I'm getting out of this marriage
while I'm still young and handsome.

18:31.829 --> 18:33.227
MARGE + HOME
4EVER

18:34.316 --> 18:35.896
4EVER.

18:36.865 --> 18:41.443
I couldn't even keep a promise I made to a tree.

18:41.478 --> 18:42.923
Maybe it's not too late!

18:42.958 --> 18:44.813
Maybe I can still save our love.

18:44.848 --> 18:47.242
If I just show her that carving.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.524
- What are you doing?
- Saving our marriage!

18:56.346 --> 18:57.805
Don't be silly.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.377
Our marriage can weather any storm,

19:00.412 --> 19:01.734
just like this tree.

19:07.076 --> 19:09.972
Help! Fat man hanging from a tree!

19:13.292 --> 19:14.601
That's for fires.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.437
Take my hand!

19:17.472 --> 19:20.023
I don't want to let go
of our special carving!

19:20.058 --> 19:22.915
Homer, our marriage
isn't on a piece of bark!

19:22.950 --> 19:25.696
It's in us! Now take my hand!

19:46.122 --> 19:48.290
Marge, I don't want to die
with us mad at each other.

19:48.325 --> 19:49.842
Me neither, Homie.

19:49.877 --> 19:52.023
I know parts of our
marriage are based on lies,

19:52.058 --> 19:55.373
but so are a lot of good things:
religion, American history.

19:55.408 --> 19:59.383
I know. We had a fight.
We were both tempted.

19:59.418 --> 20:02.277
We're human. The important
thing is we love each other.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.096
Now we wait for the river to freeze.

20:09.131 --> 20:11.577
If my theory of global cooling is correct.

20:11.612 --> 20:13.994
Hey, you guys want a
lift in my pedal boat?

20:14.029 --> 20:16.468
It's not a pedal boat. It's a pedal car

20:16.503 --> 20:18.031
that Bart drove into the river.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.849
Because he knows a shortcut
that's not on the map.

20:20.884 --> 20:23.283
How'd you like a shortcut
to the bottom of the river?

20:23.318 --> 20:26.458
If it's your shortcut,
I'll be high and dry.

20:30.856 --> 20:33.179
- Knock it off back there.
- But we're married.

20:33.214 --> 20:35.961
- Okay, but keep it PG.
- How about R?

20:35.996 --> 20:38.982
- PG-13.
- Adult situations!
