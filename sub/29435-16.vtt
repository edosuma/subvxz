Art was never married,
had no children

04:55.382 --> 04:56.861
and lists no next of kin.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.214
Art served 30 years
with a spotless record.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.652
Then, after retirement,
he stayed in off-base housing

05:04.695 --> 05:07.132

the National Museum of the Navy.

there the last 17 years.

Nice suit, old photo.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.071

of food and water.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.206

was locked from the inside.

after a neighbor heard

05:40.122 --> 05:43.125
the car running and saw exhaust
through the garage windows.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.083
And then there is
the suicide note.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.476

05:46.520 --> 05:48.870
Matches samples we found
from the deceased.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.568

are all stuffed

05:51.612 --> 05:53.048

06:11.327 --> 06:12.763
at the Museum of the Navy.

06:12.807 --> 06:16.463
Art's a volunteer. And a friend.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.247
Can you tell me what's going on?

06:26.168 --> 06:28.213
Oh, Art.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.259
Did he tell you
about doing this?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.303
No.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.524
But when I got
to the museum today,

06:34.568 --> 06:37.092
I found this note on my desk.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.485
It's from Art,

06:38.528 --> 06:40.704
asking me to take care
of his dog, Sonny Lee.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.358
Which I'm more
than happy to do.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.927
But I also found this
in the envelope.

06:45.970 --> 06:49.931
The note said he wanted it
donated to the museum.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.237
So I knew there was a problem.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.717
There's a problem
with the silver dollar?

06:53.761 --> 06:55.545
I take it none of you
are numismatists?

06:55.589 --> 06:58.026
I was raised Catholic.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.637
A numismatist studies currency.

07:00.681 --> 07:04.859
And this is an 1870 S Seated
Liberty Dollar.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.688
It's one of the most valuable
coins in the world.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.125
We're talking
a seven-figure valuation, easy.

07:10.168 --> 07:13.128
What is a retired sailor doing
with a million-dollar coin?

07:13.171 --> 07:15.173
I have no idea.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.707
MARIE:
Art never mentioned
this coin before.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.839
As far as I know,
he wasn't even a collector.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.406
Doesn't make sense.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.016
The coin have Navy significance?

07:32.060 --> 07:34.454
No. Its value to the museum
is purely monetary.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.151
We'd likely sell it at auction.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.806
Art knew we've been facing
serious budget cuts.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.895
You're government-funded.Which means the
Naval History

07:40.938 --> 07:42.940
and Heritage Command
is subject to the same

07:42.984 --> 07:45.421
congressional whims as NCIS.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.163
To compensate, we have to
close a few exhibits next week.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.774
Mostly late Vietnam War era.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.167
That's when Art served.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.169
Naturally, he was upset
about the closings.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.998
I mean, not enough
to kill himself.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.000
Although, his donation would

07:59.043 --> 08:01.785
keep those exhibits open
indefinitely.

08:01.829 --> 08:02.830
If it's even real.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.441
You're in luck.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.531
I just got off the phone with my
coin collector contact Connie.

08:08.575 --> 08:12.448
We confirmed this Seated Liberty
is the real deal.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.058
The 1870 S gets its name

08:14.102 --> 08:15.756
from the tiny S on the back.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.845
Signifying it was struck
in the San Francisco mint.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.456
12 of these coins are believed
to still be in existence.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.458
So we looked for one matching
this description and grade.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.894
Get a match?

08:23.938 --> 08:27.550
Nope. Which makes this coin
lucky number 13.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.944
Also means we can't
trace its origins.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.511
Well, not using
a numismatist, anyway.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.165
But Connie did estimate
this coin's value

08:34.209 --> 08:36.951
at around
$1.4 million.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.562
That's incredible.
But I can't take it.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.913
Afraid you'll accidentally
use it in a vending machine?

08:42.957 --> 08:44.306
The museum can't accept a gift

08:44.349 --> 08:45.960
without knowing
where it came from.

08:46.003 --> 08:49.703
That coin is worth more than
Art made in a lifetime.

08:49.746 --> 08:53.141
I have no reason to believe he
was into something shady, but...

08:53.184 --> 08:56.536
But it sure seems like Art
was into something shady.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.103
He knew that dollar
would raise suspicions.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.365
Art must have left
something behind

09:00.409 --> 09:01.584
to show where it came from.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.977
You just have to find it.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.588
Please.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.897
I know just the man for the job.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.681
"Ephemera."

09:11.725 --> 09:16.033
Written or printed memorabilia
for short-term use.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.906
From the Greek ephemeros:

09:18.949 --> 09:20.647
to last for a day.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.912
Yeah, 'cause then you are
supposed to throw it away.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.131
Yeah, Art didn't throw
anything away. Look at all this.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.438
Old receipts, letters.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.658
Ooh. Hi-fi stereo instructions.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.312
Or a takeout menu
from 1972.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.792
Why keep this crap?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.141
Time travel.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.709
An item that might
seem worthless to us

09:39.753 --> 09:42.059
could trigger memories
for Arturo.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.453
Clearly, he kept
all of this for a reason.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.802
What, like a hoarding disorder?

09:45.846 --> 09:49.632
This ephemera was stored
in boxes and cabinets.

09:49.676 --> 09:53.288
That suggests deliberate action,
not compulsion.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.072
Well, it doesn't look
deliberate to me.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.249
These are just thrown together
in no particular order.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.338
Yeah, and now we've got to sort
it all in the hopes of finding

10:00.382 --> 10:02.906
something in here that explains
our mystery coin.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.082
This is impossible.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.345
Like getting vomit
out of a Berber carpet.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.653
Or filling out 20 pages
of medical insurance forms.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.830
Dr. Palmer was telling me
that you're all suffering

10:13.874 --> 10:15.310
from an acute case

10:15.353 --> 10:16.659
of the blahs.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.443
The blah-est.

10:18.487 --> 10:22.578
Yeah, well, this task might
prove to be the perfect remedy.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.493
What, ephemera gets out stains?

10:24.536 --> 10:27.670
No. But it might
offer an escape.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.586
Every scrap of paper
in this garage

10:30.630 --> 10:33.850
could transport you
to another time.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.158
Where you could
become someone else.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.594
Why would I want
to be anyone else?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.901
Stay with me, Torres.

10:40.944 --> 10:45.122
This is a chance for all of you
to picture yourselves

10:45.166 --> 10:46.689
living another life.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.170
You can be free.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.043
And by "free",

10:53.087 --> 10:55.002
I mean
you're stuck here,

10:55.045 --> 10:57.265
whether you time travel or not.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.232
Burns, Doc?

11:08.276 --> 11:09.364
Yeah, from decades ago.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.887
Unrelated to the cause of death.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.760
Which was carbon
monoxide poisoning.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.022
Car exhaust.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.241
And nearly impossible
with today's cars,

11:17.285 --> 11:19.026
as they all have
catalytic converters.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.767
A '70 Oldsmobile
doesn't.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.640
Yeah.
So, our retired master chief

11:24.684 --> 11:26.250
inhaled deeply,

11:26.294 --> 11:29.471
passed out, and succumbed
to acute toxicity.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.038
Suicide.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.517
Which you already knew.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.085
What you don't know
until I tell you, is...

11:35.129 --> 11:36.608
What?

11:36.652 --> 11:39.263
It was cancer.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.265
These are Art's brain scans
from the VA.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.312
And that is a glioblastoma
on his temporal lobe.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.400
Tumor.

11:45.443 --> 11:49.056
Inoperable. Terminal.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.232
This man would have less
than a year to live,

11:51.275 --> 11:53.321
and that year
would have been...

11:55.453 --> 11:57.281
...year would
have been rough.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.848
Who, Jim?

12:00.894 --> 12:02.504
My Nana Palmer.

12:04.071 --> 12:08.292
Gibbs, it was the same
glioblastoma, same location.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.773
She started having
trouble speaking,

12:10.817 --> 12:12.514
understanding
language.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.909
And then we
just... watched.

12:15.952 --> 12:20.261
As her memories
faded, until...

12:20.304 --> 12:21.610
she wasn't Nana anymore.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.004
Yeah. Scary as hell.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.049
Especially for her.

12:28.399 --> 12:32.055
Art's way out may have been
the cleaner exit.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.145
[birds singing]

12:35.189 --> 12:36.190
[children chattering
in distance]

12:36.233 --> 12:38.279
Oh, my God, check this out.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.369
I just found a ticket stub
to the original Star Warsmovie.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.244
No one else thinks this is cool?

12:47.288 --> 12:48.376
I found something better.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.856
The ticket to
Empire Strikes Back?

12:49.899 --> 12:54.121
A brochure for
a 1968 Mustang. Fastback.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.992
And the price

12:56.036 --> 12:57.385
is cheaper than my rent.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.474
[scoffs]Too soon?

12:59.517 --> 13:01.693
I thought we were
supposed to look for stuff

13:01.737 --> 13:02.825
related to the coin.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.348
Hey, Ducky said to escape;

13:04.392 --> 13:07.047
and right now, I'm escaping
in a two-tone V8, baby.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.266
Yeah, and you're gonna
swing by, pick me up,

13:09.310 --> 13:11.094
and we're gonna catch
a Star Warsmatinee.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.923
I most definitely
will notbe picking you up.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.316
Wait, stop.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.318
Fine. I will drop off the nerd

13:17.361 --> 13:18.928
at the imaginary movie theater.

13:18.972 --> 13:22.714
No... stop, I think
I found something.

13:22.758 --> 13:23.846
Is it about the coin?

13:23.890 --> 13:28.503
It's a love letter
from 1972,

13:28.546 --> 13:30.244
signed "Annie."

13:30.287 --> 13:32.594
The photo Art was
holding when he died.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.726
This letter talks about

13:34.770 --> 13:36.946
the night Art
and Annie first met

13:36.990 --> 13:38.730
at a Navy gala.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.167
It's very romantic.

I found another letter.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.724
Let me see.

15:44.204 --> 15:47.511
Sir. I am in love
with your daughter.

15:50.036 --> 15:53.822
And I'd like your blessing
before asking her to marry me.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.435
MAN:
I always wanted
a daughter.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.092
And now, you are asking me
to give her away.

[chuckles]

16:08.445 --> 16:10.360
Arturo...

16:12.362 --> 16:14.321
You see this coin?

16:14.364 --> 16:18.325
It is very rare
and it's very valuable.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.414
Like my daughter, it's special.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.332
You agree?

16:25.375 --> 16:27.725
Annie is special, right?Yes, sir.

16:27.769 --> 16:31.164
Then you know that she deserves

16:31.207 --> 16:33.383
someone just as special.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.953
I'm not giving her away
to a poor sailor.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.521
Sir, I grew up with nothing.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.784
But the Navy made me
into something.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.571
It still doesn't change
the fact that

16:47.615 --> 16:49.530
you are ordinary.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.620
Common.
An everyday quarter.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.277
And a tarnished one.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.325
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.544
You know
what this means?

17:03.587 --> 17:05.241
Annie's father
was a dick.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.983
Well, that too,
but the letter mentions

17:08.027 --> 17:09.245
"father's
silver dollar."

17:09.289 --> 17:10.681
That's got to be
our mystery coin.

17:10.725 --> 17:11.943
So how did Art get it?

17:11.987 --> 17:13.858
I might be able to answer that.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.557
NCIS.
Can we help you?
Uh,

17:16.600 --> 17:18.124
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.777
But my name is Spencer Downing,

17:19.821 --> 17:21.605
and the coin you found,

17:21.649 --> 17:25.783
was stolen from my family
almost 50 years ago.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.490
This coin belonged
to my father.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.100
He always thought Art
was some kind of gold digger,

17:38.144 --> 17:40.755
but I never did, until now.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.365
You said this coin was stolen?

17:42.409 --> 17:45.890
This silver dollar went missing
in March of 1972.

17:45.934 --> 17:48.110
Did you suspect Art back then?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.765
Father did, but he could never
prove a thing.

17:50.808 --> 17:54.551
[sighs] I'm only glad my
little sister isn't here to...

17:54.595 --> 17:57.206
hear the truth.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.948
It would've broken her heart.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.254
Annie?
Mmm.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.342
And where is she now?

18:02.385 --> 18:05.127
She passed away in '72, uh...

18:05.171 --> 18:07.129
shortly after
the coin went missing.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.217
McGEE:
Sorry to hear that.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.089
What, uh, what'd she die from?

18:10.132 --> 18:12.221
Thyroid disease.
The same thing that

18:12.265 --> 18:14.223
killed our mother
when Annie and I were kids.

18:14.267 --> 18:18.227
You have proof
this coin's your dad's?

18:18.271 --> 18:21.230
Appraisals and, uh,
insurance records

18:21.274 --> 18:23.580
to prove provenance.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.061
I dug them out of storage
when I had to sell Father's

18:26.105 --> 18:27.628
coin collections last year.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.934
The Downing
family business

18:29.978 --> 18:31.632
isn't exactly
what it used to be.

18:31.675 --> 18:32.807
What business is that?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.113
Downing Fabrication

18:34.156 --> 18:36.071
used to be
the leading manufacturer

18:36.115 --> 18:37.812
of industrial
printing presses.

18:37.855 --> 18:41.903
We're now a repair business
for the machines still in use.

18:41.946 --> 18:45.689
Nowadays, most people
get their news online.Mm.

18:45.733 --> 18:49.693
Which is, uh...
why the company's in debt,

18:49.737 --> 18:52.479
and currently in danger
of shutting down completely.

18:52.522 --> 18:56.091
But selling that last coin
could change things.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.180
You're still gonna need to prove
how Art ended up with it.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.923
I get that, but this,
this coin can save,

19:01.966 --> 19:03.229
can save jobs.

19:04.491 --> 19:09.191
These are people's lives
we're talking about.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.193
WOMAN:
These insurance documents
are authentic?

19:11.237 --> 19:12.368
BISHOP:
Mm-hmm.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.197
I don't know why
I got my hopes up.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.504
Suppose I didn't want
to believe Art was a thief.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.506
Well, we don't know
that he was.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.595
Thieves usually steal
for profit.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.510
And Art
never sold that coin.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.033
His car was
50 years old,

19:25.076 --> 19:26.643
along with everything
else in his house,

19:26.687 --> 19:30.647
and thieves usually
don't dedicate their lives

19:30.691 --> 19:32.214
to the Navy.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.522
Or become
museum volunteers?

19:35.565 --> 19:38.220
This was his
favorite wing.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.180
I'd often find Art
in this very spot,

19:41.223 --> 19:42.964
humming to himself.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.358
So, this exhibit's closing?Yes.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.361
Unless you're telling me
I should get my hopes up again.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.623
I am telling you that we still

19:49.666 --> 19:51.190
have a lot of questions
to answer.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.629
You will be
glad to hear

19:55.672 --> 19:58.284
this is the last load.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.373
From Art's garage to ours.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.244
Mm, the only way to
get through all this

20:02.288 --> 20:04.028
is with more space
and more eyeballs.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.856
Oh, don't worry.
With this lot,

20:05.900 --> 20:08.555
it's all hands on deck.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.644
Whoa. Ha-ha.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.254
I'm glad to see

20:12.298 --> 20:16.258
that you have embraced
the escape of ephemera.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.609
Ah. Did you identify
with the young lovers?

20:19.653 --> 20:22.003
What? [scoffs]
No way.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.005
Well, we're only tracking
their relationship

20:24.048 --> 20:25.354
to find out what happened
with the coin.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.051
We don't care about the romance.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.923
Oh, my God,
he bought her a ring!Shut up.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.405
Cathedral setting,
diamond solitaire,

20:32.448 --> 20:35.321
$1,200.I told you
Art had game.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.018
Or...

20:37.061 --> 20:40.239
the ring was merely
a small investment

20:40.282 --> 20:43.154
in his attempt to steal
a million-dollar coin.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.287
Oh, come on.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.463
No, that's
a fair point.N-- Mm.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.423
It-it all depends
whether you believe

20:50.466 --> 20:53.426
that this was a con...

20:53.469 --> 20:55.471
or a love story.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.430
Hmm?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.519
CARTER:
You got to
be kidding.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.304
What's the matter with you?

21:02.348 --> 21:05.438
Nothing, Dad,
I'm... I'm getting married.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.354
What are you doing?

21:10.181 --> 21:11.966
Dad!

21:12.009 --> 21:13.489
It's for your own good.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.274
BERTHA: I've
heard that before.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.798
Father said the same,
didn't he, dear brother,

21:17.841 --> 21:19.800
when you wanted
to marry Florence?

21:19.843 --> 21:23.325
You leave my wife out of this,
God rest her saintly soul.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.720
Believe me, cutie,
Flo wasn't such a saint.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.331
But you married her anyway.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.593
I loved her.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.726
And I love Arturo,
so what's the difference?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.945
She's got a good point
there, Carter.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.730
What do you care, Bertha?

21:36.773 --> 21:39.385
With your liver, you won't live
to see a wedding.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.431
I'm pickled.
I'll last forever.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.303
You want to marry that man,

21:44.346 --> 21:46.348
you don't need a ring
or your father.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.395
All I need is Art.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.444
He will hold you back.

21:55.488 --> 21:59.056
Every time Art gets reassigned,
you will have to move.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.624
Every time he deploys,
you'll have to worry.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
Personally, financially,

22:03.409 --> 22:05.324
you will have
to take care of him.

22:08.196 --> 22:12.418
No. We will take care
of each other.

22:12.461 --> 22:15.334
But I guess you forgot
that's what marriage is.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.475
"I've never spoken
to my father like that,

22:26.519 --> 22:28.999
but even Aunt Bertha
couldn't talk sense to him."

22:29.043 --> 22:30.697
I like this Bertha woman.

22:30.740 --> 22:31.915
Who?

22:31.959 --> 22:33.395
Weren't you listening?

22:33.439 --> 22:36.398
We found another love letter
that Annie sent to Art.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.358
We also found proof
of the ring, theater programs

22:39.401 --> 22:42.578
and plenty of restaurant
receipts, so it's clear

22:42.622 --> 22:44.319
that the lovers kept dating.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.321
Don't tell me about love,
tell me about the coin.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.714
Always the romantic,
aren't you?

22:47.757 --> 22:49.411
Jack, did Art steal it
or not?

22:49.455 --> 22:50.934
We're working on it.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.414
There's a lot of ephemera
to go through,

22:52.458 --> 22:56.375
and the writing on these letters
is very hard to read.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.115
The lost art of penmanship.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.508
Got more love letters?No.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.031
Because I haven't been
going through Art's crap,

23:01.075 --> 23:03.033
I've been going
through MPD's crap.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.470
Police report
on the stolen coin.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.342
If the family filed one,
MPD can't find it.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.780
All they had on the name
Downing was this.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.869
Domestic disturbance.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.784
Between Art and Annie.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.961
This fairy-tale letter stuff
might be too good to be true.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.487
Our guy could be
a thief after all.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.664
[muffled]: I can't believe
you're just gonna leave.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.448
No, you're not even listening
to what I'm saying.No, you told me

23:26.492 --> 23:28.711
you were gonna stay; I can't
believe you're gonna leave.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.452
...at stake right now...[loud knock on window]

23:30.496 --> 23:32.323
Excuse me!

23:32.367 --> 23:33.890
Roll down your window, sir.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.894
Is there a problem, Officer?

23:41.158 --> 23:42.725
You tell us.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.466
We got a call from
some restaurant patrons

23:44.510 --> 23:47.164
saying that they saw a man
attacking a woman in a car.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.818
What? No, there was no attack.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.472
You sure about that,
Ricky Ricardo?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.561
Everything okay, ma'am?

23:52.605 --> 23:53.910
Looks like you've been crying.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.565
I'm fine. We-We've just
been arguing, that's all.

23:59.568 --> 24:02.397
No sign of violence
or contraband.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.659
Sir, step out of the car.

24:03.703 --> 24:04.921
What? What she just said...

24:04.965 --> 24:06.183
Hey, are we gonna have
a problem here?

24:06.227 --> 24:08.447
I said,

24:08.490 --> 24:10.057
step out of the car.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.631
Put your hands on the hood.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.685
He clean?

24:31.078 --> 24:32.949
Yeah, he's clean.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.561
Nothing but a stick of gum
and an old silver dollar.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.087
So when police searched him,

24:40.130 --> 24:42.306
Art had a silver dollar
in his pocket.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.525
Rule 39.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.048
So he did steal the coin.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.615
Annie could have found out.
That might have been

24:46.659 --> 24:47.660
what they argued
about in the car.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.183
Well, why didn't she
tell anyone?

24:49.226 --> 24:51.446
I think I know why. I just
spent the last three hours

24:51.490 --> 24:53.056
digging up Annie Downing's
medical records.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.667
Why?I told him to.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.886
Covering all the bases.
Smart move, boss.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.758
I went back through
a list of Annie's symptoms.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.543
Now, she absolutely could have
died of thyroid failure.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.066
After all,
there is a family history.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.112
Except?While alopecia

25:05.155 --> 25:06.635
is related to thyroid issues,

25:06.679 --> 25:08.202
a sudden burning on the tongue

25:08.245 --> 25:09.595
and the bottom
of the feet is not.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.597
She also has gastrointestinal
disturbances,

25:11.640 --> 25:13.207
polyneuritis, encephalopathy,

25:13.250 --> 25:14.556
skin eruptions...What's the point?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.166
Thyroid failure
only accounts

25:16.210 --> 25:17.907
for about half
of these symptoms.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.997
I came up with a diagnosis that
explains all of the symptoms.

25:21.041 --> 25:23.565
This was heavy metal toxicity.Poison?

25:23.609 --> 25:27.177
I'm pretty sure
Annie Downing was murdered.

25:36.317 --> 25:37.623
This is crazy, McGee.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.538
Yeah, when Nick and I
left last night,

25:39.581 --> 25:42.497
all we had was the robbery,
and now we have a murder?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.020
No way Art did this.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.370
What, steal a million-dollar
coin or poison his girlfriend?

25:46.414 --> 25:47.763
Both.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.939
Well, we've got proof
that Annie's father owned

25:49.983 --> 25:51.506
this Seated Liberty dollar,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.900
and a police report that shows
Art had one in his pocket.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.554
You can't prove
it's the same one.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.381
Well, there's only
a dozen of 'em in the world,

25:57.425 --> 25:59.470
let alone two
in the tri-state area.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.168
Well, coincidence may be
a Gibbs Rule,

26:01.211 --> 26:02.691
but it still does not
prove anything.

26:02.735 --> 26:03.953
TORRES: This man grew
up with nothing.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.652
He dedicated his whole life
to the Navy.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.262
He wouldn't give that up.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.351
His last wish was to save
a museum wing.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.005
Does that sound like
a criminal to you?

26:12.048 --> 26:14.921
No, but it sounds like you two
are taking it personally.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.184
Ducky told us to see ourselves
as someone else.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.359
Imagine if that was you.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.187
Would you want
to be remembered

26:20.230 --> 26:21.275
as a thief or a killer?

26:21.318 --> 26:22.842
No, which is why
I agree with you.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.408
I don't think that
Art did it either.

26:24.452 --> 26:27.368
Oh. Really?

26:27.411 --> 26:31.154
No. Art was on a tour of duty
in Vietnam when Annie got sick.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.200
So he couldn't have killed her.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.593
Unless he poisoned her

26:34.636 --> 26:37.465
before his deployment,
or hired someone to do it

26:37.508 --> 26:38.422
while he was gone.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.641
Is that what
you think happened?

26:39.685 --> 26:41.208
Of course not.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.471
What we need is evidence
that proves that.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.168
Then let's find some.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.867
Well, for starters,
we're gonna need more than

26:47.910 --> 26:49.433
Jimmy's opinion to prove murder.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.652
Start with the body.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.436
I've already got the court order

26:52.480 --> 26:53.437
and the paperwork needed

26:53.481 --> 26:55.048
for Annie Downing's remains.

26:55.091 --> 26:57.833
Digging up bodies.
Ooh, that's all you guys.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.314
Actually, we don't have to dig.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.449
Ah...

27:06.842 --> 27:08.583
No one's been in here
for decades.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.108
Yeah, it's not exactly
a chill-- ooh-- hangout.

27:13.893 --> 27:16.722
Got Mom and Dad over here.

27:18.506 --> 27:21.117
Here she is.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.652
[grunts]

27:35.566 --> 27:38.657
All right, you push on three,
right?

27:40.397 --> 27:42.704
You okay?Yeah, it's just, um,

27:42.748 --> 27:46.142
after reading
her personal letters,

27:46.186 --> 27:47.883
I feel like I know her.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.493
Well, then,
let's solve her murder.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.717
[Jimmy grunts]

27:58.589 --> 28:00.548
Hello, Annie.

28:00.591 --> 28:03.116
All right, let's get a look
at these fingernails.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.248
See the erosion
at the proximal folds?

28:08.817 --> 28:10.689
This woman was definitely
poisoned.

28:10.732 --> 28:11.864
What kind of poison?

28:11.907 --> 28:14.344
For that, we'll need
a tissue sample.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.524
Wait a minute.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.875
You find something else?

28:22.918 --> 28:25.834
A cathedral-setting
diamond solitaire.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.405
She's wearing Art's
engagement ring.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.233
I thought her dad
threw that in the fire.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.670
He did.

28:39.979 --> 28:42.851
So how did Art's ring
get on Annie's corpse?

28:42.895 --> 28:45.201
Wrong question.
How does it help us?

28:46.463 --> 28:48.727
Well, Art and Annie's
relationship...

28:48.770 --> 28:50.250
[phone ringing]...obviously didn't end

28:50.293 --> 28:52.121
with the fight in the car,

28:52.165 --> 28:54.776
which means that there is
no motive for murder.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.169
You need to get that?
No.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.953
Just another lawyer.

28:57.997 --> 29:00.347
The brother wants his coin back.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.131
You gonna mention
his sister was killed?

29:02.175 --> 29:03.437
No. Not until we know more.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.047
We know more.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.267
Yeah? What do you got, Nick?More letters.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.138
From Vietnam?

29:09.182 --> 29:11.619
I've seen Art's
service file,

29:11.662 --> 29:14.665
but reading it
in his own words...

29:14.709 --> 29:16.015
This guy went through hell.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.234
How did Art end up
with his own letters?

29:18.278 --> 29:21.672
I don't know, but
you should read this one.

29:23.631 --> 29:26.460
[gunfire]

29:26.503 --> 29:28.679
Anyone in here?

29:30.812 --> 29:32.422
Hey! I got you.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.597
I'm gonna get you out of here.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.512
[straining]

29:36.687 --> 29:39.386
[crying out]

29:39.429 --> 29:40.691
[clangs]

29:40.735 --> 29:42.868
Come on. [grunts]

29:42.911 --> 29:45.218
[straining]
Come on.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.002
[electricity crackling]

29:51.311 --> 29:52.268
Down here!

29:52.312 --> 29:53.835
Hey!

29:53.879 --> 29:55.663
Hey, grab my arm.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.798
The burn scars.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.582
Art saved his buddy's life.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.063
Yeah, and check this out.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.978
These letters were not
sent to Annie.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.545
Yeah, they're all addressed
to Bertha Jones-Delacroix.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.199
Aunt Bertha.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.679
She must have been
a go-between.

30:11.722 --> 30:15.335
Whatever happened between
Art, Annie and that coin,

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
Aunt Bertha might know.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.642
Find her.If she's still alive.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.688
I want everything
on the rest of her family.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.863
On it.

30:21.907 --> 30:25.649
Annie Downing was poisoned
with thallium,

30:25.693 --> 30:27.608
a toxic element that is
lethal when ingested

30:27.651 --> 30:29.088
or absorbed through the skin.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.220
Thallium.
Why does that sound familiar?

30:31.264 --> 30:32.700
You read Agatha Christie,

30:32.743 --> 30:34.484
or watch a lot of
Forensic Files?

30:34.528 --> 30:35.659
In fact, I do.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.096
Then you know it's
the perfect poison.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.098
Colorless, odorless, tasteless,

30:39.141 --> 30:40.534
and dissolvable
in water.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.232
In high doses,
thallium can kill you quick.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.495
Except Annie's death took weeks.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.846
Which means her doses were
small and consistent.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.586
Likely on a daily basis.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.937
And she kept getting sicker,
even while in the hospital.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.896
Which means the killer
kept giving her the poison.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.550
So they needed to be nearby.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.292
Well, that rules out Art.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.163
Ooh, you thought
he killed his boo?

31:01.207 --> 31:03.252
No, but it's nice
to finally have proof.

31:03.296 --> 31:06.560
We're looking for someone with
access to Annie's hospital room.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.605
Doctors, nurses...Family members.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.479
We found these letters
that said Annie's father

31:12.522 --> 31:13.784
never left her side.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.699
Dad didn't want her
to get married,

31:15.743 --> 31:17.266
so he killed his own daughter?

31:17.310 --> 31:18.746
You haveseen a lot
of Forensic Files.

31:18.789 --> 31:21.009
Okay, all right, well,
if it wasn't the dad,

31:21.053 --> 31:22.837
who had motive for murder?

31:26.797 --> 31:28.669
Boss, I got a theory.Okay.

31:28.712 --> 31:29.888
Let's hear it, McGee.

31:29.931 --> 31:32.151
Well, per your orders,
we pulled everything

31:32.194 --> 31:34.196
on the Downing family
we could find,

31:34.240 --> 31:35.806
including some old
news articles.

31:35.850 --> 31:40.072
Found one from 1972 that
mentions Downing Fabrication.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.378
The family built
printing presses.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.947
But in the early '70s,
they tried briefly expanding

31:45.991 --> 31:47.688
to industrial
scrap machines.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.864
And guess who Dad put in charge?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.301
GIBBS:
The daughter.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.824
Older brother got passed over.

31:53.868 --> 31:54.869
That's motive.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.697
Then Annie started
getting sick.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.699
Funny that Spencer
never mentioned that.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.441
Maybe because the
timing was suspicious?

32:01.484 --> 32:02.746
[metal clatters]

32:03.747 --> 32:06.663
Geez. Duck, are you good?

32:06.707 --> 32:08.709
Damn thing wouldn't budge.

32:08.752 --> 32:12.104
Uh, I noticed something
behind the drawer.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.106
The oft-forgotten

32:14.149 --> 32:15.934
Gibbs Rule 20.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.936
Always look under.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.286
That another letter from Annie?

32:20.329 --> 32:21.722
DUCKY:
It appears so.

32:21.765 --> 32:24.072
Yes, she wrote to
her beloved Arturo

32:24.116 --> 32:26.988
every day from
her hospital bed.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.859
This one is postmarked

32:28.903 --> 32:32.733
March 29, 1972.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.126
That's the day before she died.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.345
Making this
the last letter

32:36.389 --> 32:39.827
that Annie Downing ever wrote.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.491
[laughs softly]

32:54.450 --> 32:57.845
You don't have to stay, Dad.
I'll be fine.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.890
I want to be here.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.894
Though seeing you like this...

33:04.983 --> 33:07.202
Reminds you of losing Mom?

33:10.379 --> 33:15.341
The hardest thing
I ever did in my life

33:15.384 --> 33:16.864
was letting your mother go.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.866
Dad.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.912
You did everything you could.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.393
You took really
good care of her.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.052
You know, I think
we took good care of each other.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.923
That's what marriage is, right?

33:36.623 --> 33:40.540
Annie, I am so sorry.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.415
Hmm.

33:51.899 --> 33:54.380
[laughs softly]

33:54.423 --> 33:56.382
After the fire,

33:56.425 --> 33:59.428
I-I had to get it reset.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.825
When Art gets home...

34:08.916 --> 34:10.961
...and when you get better...

34:12.920 --> 34:14.530
Dad...

34:18.447 --> 34:20.449
[sniffles]

34:25.933 --> 34:28.240
McGEE:
"Spencer brought chrysanthemums.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.851
He's allergic to them, but
he knows they're my favorite..."

34:30.894 --> 34:32.809
Oh, wow.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.855
Well, I-I mean,
not about the flowers.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.378
About the engagement ring.
That explains why

34:36.422 --> 34:37.684
Annie was buried with it.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.729
Her father had
a change of heart.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.775
Yeah, something else
the brother forgot to mention.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.472
I mean, first motive
and now this?

34:43.516 --> 34:44.691
Whole lot of lies.

34:44.734 --> 34:45.996
You think Spencer Downing's
our killer?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.607
Wrong question.

34:47.650 --> 34:52.916
If Spencer was involved,
how do we prove it?

34:58.748 --> 35:01.099
Well, Annie's last letter.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.102
She and Art would've
gotten married after all.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.668
Until someone killed her.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.975
Ducky was right.
All this paper told a story.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.933
Too bad it ended in tragedy.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.110
Spencer Downing. Go.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.112
Big brother got dissed by Daddy.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.374
BISHOP:
Annie was put
in charge

35:15.417 --> 35:16.984
of the family company,

35:17.027 --> 35:18.594
so he definitely
had motive for murder.

35:18.638 --> 35:19.769
We need more than that.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.162
How about even more lies?

35:21.206 --> 35:24.165
Did some
forensic accounting here.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.471
Turns out
Spencer's story

35:25.514 --> 35:27.516
about saving jobs was total BS.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.344
He said the company
was in debt.

35:29.388 --> 35:32.130
Yeah, it is, but only because
Spencer has been secretly

35:32.173 --> 35:33.609
transferring money
into overseas accounts.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.785
So he's a liar anda crook.[phone ringing]

35:35.829 --> 35:37.787
Yeah, but how do we prove
that he's a killer?

35:37.831 --> 35:39.180
[phone continues ringing]

35:39.224 --> 35:42.183
Hmm, more angry lawyers?

35:42.227 --> 35:43.489
Yeah, Kase.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.187
I know how Annie Downing
was poisoned.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.536
I was going back through
her medical records

35:47.580 --> 35:48.755
and her love letters.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.235
In addition
to her other symptoms,

35:50.278 --> 35:52.367
Annie wrote about being
constantly thirsty.

35:52.411 --> 35:55.196
So I'm thinking oral ingestion.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.719
Poison in her food or water.

35:56.763 --> 35:59.548
Except Annie was so sick
she refused to eat.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.289
And if her water had been
poisoned, she was drinking

36:01.333 --> 36:03.422
so much she would
have been dead fast.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.381
So, how else could
Annie have unknowingly

36:06.425 --> 36:09.167
put small amounts of
poison into her own mouth?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.038
Every day for weeks on end.Exactly.

36:11.081 --> 36:12.953
It's an impossible riddle
to solve.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.303
Unless you into Agatha Christie.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.435
Let's hear it, Miss Marple.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.697
Well, I remembered

36:17.740 --> 36:21.266
Annie did something else
every day

36:21.309 --> 36:25.139
for weeks on end.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.923
Yeah, she wrote love letters.

36:26.967 --> 36:30.318
The same letters that we have
been reading this whole time.

36:33.408 --> 36:36.237
Damn. Stamps were poisoned.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.847
The backs were laced
with thallium.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.371
So every time she licked one,

36:39.414 --> 36:41.286
she ingested
a small amount of poison.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.331
Can we prove it was the brother?

36:43.375 --> 36:45.333
That's entirely
up to you, Poirot.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.772
I don't believe it. You-you
think Annie was murdered?

36:49.816 --> 36:52.732
No, we don't think. We know.

36:52.775 --> 36:56.388
Older male heir passed over
for little sister?

36:56.431 --> 36:59.260
Must have been humiliating.
So you killed her.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.132
Me? Hold on.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.006
[sneezes]

37:06.049 --> 37:08.138
[grunting]

37:09.488 --> 37:10.619
[exhales]

37:10.663 --> 37:12.142
Thank you.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.537
I didn't kill anyone.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.974
You gave Annie poisoned stamps
for her love letters.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.498
That's a cold move.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.629
Successful.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.241
But a lot has changed
since 1972.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.330
Disco died,
the Wall came down,

37:25.373 --> 37:29.899
Netflix took over the world
and DNA testing was invented.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.292
Found two
distinct profiles

37:31.336 --> 37:33.076
on the back
of more than 20 stamps.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.470
The DNA was perfectly preserved
in the adhesive.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.864
Now, one of those profiles
belongs to Annie.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.474
And the other belonged
to the killer.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.085
Now we just need a DNA sample
to prove it was you.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.436
Forget it.
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.525
You already have.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.136
Hey.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.356
You can't steal my snot.

37:51.399 --> 37:55.316
Once you threw it in the trash,
it became the property of NCIS.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.405
I'm willing to bet
that's how your DNA

37:57.449 --> 37:59.494
got on the stamps
in the first place.

38:01.148 --> 38:03.716
You sneezed while you were
lacing them with poison.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.199
[sneezes]

38:09.243 --> 38:11.941
The chrysanthemums
in Annie's letter.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.987
She mentioned
Spencer was allergic.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.684
Annie helped solve
her own murder.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.164
Love story saved the day.

38:17.207 --> 38:18.905
Story's not over.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.734
Well, we haven't solved
the case of the missing coin.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.605
It still looks
like Art was a thief.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.259
BERTHA:
Ah! Excuse me.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.392
He was no such thing.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.523
SLOANE:
Team,

38:28.567 --> 38:30.612
meet Bertha Jones-Delacroix.

38:30.656 --> 38:31.613
Aunt Bertha?

38:31.657 --> 38:33.354
Alive and kicking.

38:35.574 --> 38:36.966
SLOANE:
Gin martini.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.577
Two olives.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.884
My favorite. How did you know?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.801
I can see why you think
Art took the coin.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.412
The family certainly did.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.543
And he didn't?

38:48.587 --> 38:50.806
No, cutie.
The Navy changed his life.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.026
He'd have never
thrown that away.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.810
I knew it.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.246
I said it. I said it.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.858
It was Annie who stole the coin.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.556
My aunt was right.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.431
We don't need my father
or a ring to get married.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.737
All we need
is each other.

39:08.781 --> 39:12.698
And maybe this...

39:12.741 --> 39:14.700
[laughs softly]

39:14.743 --> 39:16.528
Annie, what did you do?

39:16.571 --> 39:18.704
We can't take this.

39:18.747 --> 39:23.143
We can sell it
and go far away from my family.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.493
Come on.
It'll be an adventure.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.452
One we can go on together.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.149
And we will.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.499
When I get back.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.196
What do you mean?

39:33.240 --> 39:36.678
Annie, uh, I got orders.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.419
To deploy.Have you seen

39:38.463 --> 39:40.465
the-the protests and the news

39:40.508 --> 39:42.336
coming out
of that place?It doesn't matter.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.555
How can you say that?

39:43.598 --> 39:45.121
Because I made
a commitment to the Navy.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.950
I can't just walk away.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.736
[speaking indistinctly]

39:50.779 --> 39:52.520
That's why they started arguing.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.914
BERTHA:
Yes. And by the time
Art came back,

39:54.957 --> 39:56.524
Annie had left.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.440
Or I should say, was taken.

39:59.484 --> 40:00.920
McGEE:
So, Art kept

40:00.963 --> 40:02.704
the coin this whole time?

40:02.748 --> 40:04.880
BERTHA:
No. He gave it back to
Annie that same night.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.404
Oh-- So if he didn't steal it

40:06.447 --> 40:07.492
and if Annie didn't
give it to him,

40:07.535 --> 40:09.450
how did Art
still end up with it?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.496
Me.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.591
I thought you'd be here.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.770
What do I do?

40:30.515 --> 40:32.995
[sighs]

40:33.039 --> 40:36.999
As hard it seems right now,

40:37.043 --> 40:39.306
you live the rest of your life.

40:44.485 --> 40:48.576
Annie, uh, wanted you
to have these back.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.754
Thank you.

40:55.670 --> 40:59.239
Uh, she asked me to, uh,

40:59.282 --> 41:00.762
give you something else.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.983
Demanded, actually.
You know how she was.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.812
No. No.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.945
What we had was not about money.

41:09.989 --> 41:13.775
I'm sure you'll figure
out what to do with it.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.530
MARIE:
I'm confused.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.531
Isn't that stolen?

41:30.575 --> 41:32.533
It's long story.

41:32.577 --> 41:33.752
Suffice to say,

41:33.795 --> 41:35.710
the old executor

41:35.754 --> 41:39.148
of the Downing estate
is going to prison for murder.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.063
And the new one is, uh,

41:41.107 --> 41:42.674
a generous woman

41:42.717 --> 41:47.113
who wants to honor
Arturo's final wishes.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.550
Coin belongs to the museum.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.421
[exhales]

41:51.465 --> 41:53.162
I don't know what to say.

41:53.206 --> 41:58.080
Other than this means Art's
favorite wing can stay open.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.734
Permanently.

41:59.778 --> 42:03.390
Did Arturo say why
this was his favorite?

42:03.433 --> 42:06.698
Well, I just assumed it was
because he served in Vietnam.

42:06.741 --> 42:09.831
Ah.Dr. Mallard, as
NCIS historian,

42:09.875 --> 42:13.443
might I interest you in
a private tour of our archives?

42:13.487 --> 42:15.184
That would be delightful.

42:15.228 --> 42:16.708
Care to join us, Agent Gibbs?

42:16.751 --> 42:19.493
No. I'm gonna look around here.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.408
