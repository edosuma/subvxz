00:08.300 --> 00:10.500
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.800
I'm married,

00:11.900 --> 00:14.100
I live in a small town,

00:14.200 --> 00:16.000
and I own an antique shop.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.000
I might be just like you.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.800
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:19.900 --> 00:22.500
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.600
It's all right, honey.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.906 --> 00:29.400
They're stuck here, because they have
unfinished business with the living,

00:29.504 --> 00:33.201
and they come to me for help.

00:34.803 --> 00:40.208
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:44.701 --> 00:46.109
So how long were they married?

00:46.209 --> 00:49.403
Just a few months.
He was so crazy about her.

00:49.506 --> 00:51.301
How come he never brought her
into the store?

00:51.408 --> 00:55.801
I don't know. Maybe he was just tryin'
to buy her things to surprise her.

00:55.906 --> 00:59.103
He is a great customer and so sweet.

00:59.205 --> 01:03.603
Anyway, we don't have to
stay that long.

01:05.507 --> 01:07.800
Jake.

01:08.105 --> 01:10.603
How are you?

01:10.707 --> 01:13.200
You remember my friend Melinda.

01:13.308 --> 01:14.502
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.801
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

01:16.906 --> 01:20.601
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:29.406 --> 01:32.402
That's his wife?

01:33.206 --> 01:35.503
Tell me about it.

01:35.607 --> 01:37.602
What's wrong with this picture?

01:37.706 --> 01:43.703
I land the richest guy in Driscoll
County, and my heart gives out.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.401
This is like poetic injustice.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.100
I'm sorry.

01:52.908 --> 01:54.501
Are you interested in crossing over?

01:54.607 --> 01:56.100
- You mean that light?
- Yeah.

01:56.206 --> 01:59.302
I really think you should go into
that light, you'll find peace there.

01:59.408 --> 02:00.702
Peace.

02:00.806 --> 02:02.001
I'm thirty...

02:02.108 --> 02:03.800
28 years old.

02:03.905 --> 02:06.801
What do I want with peace?

02:06.907 --> 02:09.402
Besides, I...

02:09.508 --> 02:11.500
I really did love him.

02:11.605 --> 02:14.403
Everything ok?

02:14.805 --> 02:18.701
You didn't tell me that
his wife was so youthful.

02:18.807 --> 02:20.101
I thought you knew.

02:20.205 --> 02:21.901
Nice jacket.

02:22.005 --> 02:26.303
- She likes your jacket.
- Oh, thank...

02:27.705 --> 02:30.201
- No.
- Yes.

02:30.306 --> 02:31.903
- Is that supposed to happen?
- What?

02:32.008 --> 02:34.900
The light, it's... it's like...

02:35.006 --> 02:39.502
it's not so bright anymore, like
there's something getting in the way.

02:39.606 --> 02:41.602
- Oh, that's freaky.
- What is?

02:41.706 --> 02:45.802
I'm gonna go hang somewhere else.
This is too creepy.

02:45.907 --> 02:47.703
What's going on?

02:47.807 --> 02:49.301
I'll tell you later.

02:49.407 --> 02:53.303
Gonna go find the ladies' room.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.400
Stop crying. I'm not dead!

02:56.507 --> 02:59.402
I'm right here! Look at me!

02:59.505 --> 03:03.302
What is wrong with you people?

03:15.708 --> 03:19.603
You're very confused right now.

03:19.907 --> 03:21.102
It's a difficult time.

03:21.206 --> 03:23.103
How come you can see me and they can't?

03:23.206 --> 03:25.303
That's a long story.

03:25.408 --> 03:27.900
The important thing is...

03:28.007 --> 03:31.902
there's a better place for you.

04:37.507 --> 04:40.300
EPISODE 2x20

04:42.505 --> 04:44.201
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

04:44.307 --> 04:48.103
Are you sure the guy you saw
was talking to a ghost,

04:48.206 --> 04:49.200
not just talking to himself,
and the ghost...

04:49.307 --> 04:51.900
I know what I saw.
They were interacting, ok?

04:52.008 --> 04:55.903
Ghost to human, human to ghost.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.500
Well, that means there's
someone else out there...

04:59.606 --> 05:01.102
Like me? I know.

05:01.207 --> 05:03.603
Ok, there's always been
my grandmother and my mom

05:03.706 --> 05:05.902
with whatever abilities she has,
but I have always wondered

05:06.007 --> 05:09.303
what it would be like to have
a friend who saw what I saw,

05:09.407 --> 05:12.103
who felt what I felt.

05:12.206 --> 05:13.301
Well, I mean, this is weird, Mel.

05:13.406 --> 05:16.000
What are the chances
that there are 2 people like...

05:16.108 --> 05:16.903
in Grandview?

05:17.008 --> 05:19.402
I know, which is why
I'm all questions right now,

05:19.505 --> 05:21.101
and I have to talk to this guy.

05:21.207 --> 05:22.702
I'm gonna go back to that
funeral home tomorrow

05:22.806 --> 05:25.601
and see if they at least have
a guest book that I can look at.

05:25.706 --> 05:29.501
I'm never gonna sleep tonight.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.600
What?

05:51.108 --> 05:53.802
Who are you?

05:56.006 --> 05:58.502
Wait. I remember you.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.501
You were on the plane.

06:00.608 --> 06:03.703
- I made a mistake.
- I know.

06:03.807 --> 06:05.501
You didn't cross over.

06:05.607 --> 06:09.001
Don't let them find me.

06:12.908 --> 06:15.900
We call it the Harold and Maude
syndrome, from the movie.

06:16.008 --> 06:18.403
People who hang around
wakes and funerals.

06:18.505 --> 06:21.203
- So have you ever seen him before?
- I've seen him a bunch of times,

06:21.305 --> 06:23.401
at the cemetery, too.

06:23.507 --> 06:25.203
Has he ever spoken to you?

06:25.308 --> 06:29.701
Once or twice. Nice guy.
Seems harmless.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.102
Damn.

06:33.207 --> 06:36.102
Would you mind?

06:37.307 --> 06:39.502
So,

06:39.606 --> 06:40.901
what did he say to you?

06:41.007 --> 06:44.901
Oh, you know, the usual questions.
Did I know I was dead? How did I die?

06:45.006 --> 06:47.303
Do I know other dead people?
Blah, blah, blah.

06:47.405 --> 06:50.103
I said, "Look, I like it here.
I have no intention of leaving.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.403
"You wanna be a do-gooder, go help
that confused old lady over there

06:52.507 --> 06:54.300
who doesn't even know she's dead,
poor thing. "

06:54.408 --> 06:56.401
Could I check your guest book?

06:56.505 --> 06:58.100
Sure.

06:58.207 --> 07:00.602
So does he ever know the people
who are being waked?

07:00.705 --> 07:02.700
I don't think so.
And it's usually young ones.

07:02.805 --> 07:05.302
He never pays much attention
to the old people.

07:05.407 --> 07:07.803
I just don't get all this
fascination with the dead.

07:07.908 --> 07:11.301
For me, it's almost like being alive,
except a lot less expensive,

07:11.406 --> 07:12.700
and I never get asked for directions.

07:12.806 --> 07:15.902
That alone was almost worth
keeling over for.

07:16.005 --> 07:18.103
Can I help you with something?

07:18.208 --> 07:23.902
Oh. I realized that I forgot
to sign the book yesterday, so...

07:24.805 --> 07:26.501
Look at that.

07:26.607 --> 07:28.900
Done.

07:30.905 --> 07:32.502
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Buster.

07:32.608 --> 07:34.802
When I ran this place,
there was never one crooked tie.

07:34.908 --> 07:36.801
I am sick of doing your job,

07:36.908 --> 07:38.502
sick of it.

07:38.606 --> 07:40.202
Close your mouth.

07:40.308 --> 07:41.500
I don't know that I can.

07:41.608 --> 07:43.303
I recommend it for your next class.

07:43.408 --> 07:45.200
How are you not jumping out
of your skin over this?

07:45.308 --> 07:46.900
I don't know anything
about this guy, ok?

07:47.008 --> 07:48.900
He could be a friend or a foe.
It could be a hoax.

07:49.006 --> 07:51.601
Hoax? Hoax?
Melinda, listen to yourself.

07:51.706 --> 07:53.400
You sound just like all those
frightened little people

07:53.508 --> 07:55.101
that have doubted you your whole life.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.801
You were one of those
not too long ago.

07:56.908 --> 07:59.401
I'm a scientist. It's my job to doubt
you and be frightened all the time.

07:59.508 --> 08:02.401
That's my job. And quite frankly, when
I doubted you, my life was a lot simpler.

08:02.505 --> 08:04.601
- Doubt was my friend.
- Doubt was your crutch.

08:04.705 --> 08:06.303
Are we gonna find this ghost guy,
or are we gonna write bumper stickers?

08:06.408 --> 08:08.901
I'm trying to find him,
but I don't know anything else except

08:09.005 --> 08:11.201
his name is Gabriel, and he likes to

08:11.308 --> 08:13.302
hang out at funeral homes
and cemeteries.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.501
Ok, great. So he doesn't have
a lot of colorful clothing.

08:15.607 --> 08:16.801
That narrows it down. What else?

08:16.906 --> 08:18.503
Why would a guy like this
pop up in Grandview?

08:18.605 --> 08:19.800
I don't know, but I wanna find out.

08:19.907 --> 08:21.900
Maybe you guys were meant to find
each other for some reason.

08:22.104 --> 08:22.501
For what reason?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.308
Maybe you have to find him
cheerier hobbies.

08:25.401 --> 08:27.709
Ok, look, in case this guy
turns out to be the real deal,

08:27.809 --> 08:29.602
will you just look this
stuff up for me, ok?

08:29.707 --> 08:31.403
Same ability, same place, same time.

08:31.507 --> 08:33.701
Yes, I will, but listen.
The second you find this guy,

08:33.807 --> 08:35.903
you bring him right here immediately.
Do you understand?

08:36.008 --> 08:38.303
That's exactly what I'll do.

08:38.408 --> 08:40.303
Were you being sarcastic?

08:40.405 --> 08:43.400
Was that sarca...

08:45.406 --> 08:49.102
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

08:49.205 --> 08:51.302
- Hey, good morning.
- Sorry I'm late.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.300
Is everything ok?

08:52.405 --> 08:54.803
Yeah, I was just a little distracted.
How are you?

08:54.907 --> 08:55.302
Good.

08:55.407 --> 09:00.102
You know, we never really got a chance
to talk about what happened yesterday.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.803
Weird, huh?

09:02.906 --> 09:06.803
So you're saying that the ghost
of Jake's wife was at the wake,

09:06.907 --> 09:08.602
like literally in the room.

09:08.707 --> 09:10.800
Yeah. Ghosts usually go to
their wakes and funerals.

09:10.908 --> 09:13.003
They like to see who came,
check out what they look like.

09:13.105 --> 09:15.303
Hair, clothing, the whole deal.

09:15.408 --> 09:17.801
Really?

09:20.105 --> 09:24.900
And you actually have conversations
like we're having right now?

09:25.007 --> 09:28.901
Delia, why are you asking me this?
You know that it makes you crazy.

09:29.007 --> 09:32.001
It's just that when I think about
ghosts and, you know, stuff like that,

09:32.108 --> 09:34.400
I imagine them to be kind of cloudy,

09:34.506 --> 09:38.801
transparent people
dragging chains, you know.

09:38.908 --> 09:43.100
I get some of those, too, believe me.

09:45.805 --> 09:49.601
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

10:18.406 --> 10:21.203
I need help.
I have to get out of here.

10:21.305 --> 10:23.603
Who are you? You're not
the one who can help me.

10:23.705 --> 10:26.701
I can help you,
but you have to let me.

10:26.808 --> 10:28.700
There's a better place for you.
I can help you get there,

10:28.807 --> 10:31.503
but you have to want it.

10:31.607 --> 10:33.501
She's the one.

10:33.606 --> 10:37.100
She's the one who can help me.

10:37.205 --> 10:38.900
Oh, hi.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.402
Didn't see you standing there.
You must think I'm crazy.

10:42.507 --> 10:45.000
Sometimes I talk to myself.

10:45.105 --> 10:48.500
Good way to get locked up, right?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.403
Do you see the light?

10:50.505 --> 10:53.300
Do you see it?

10:53.705 --> 10:55.302
I'm not sure.

10:55.406 --> 10:59.303
There's something in the way.
I can't get close.

10:59.407 --> 11:03.102
Are you sure that there are not people
waiting for you, like family or...

11:03.205 --> 11:04.901
No. They're not.

11:05.006 --> 11:08.501
Tell me what you can see.

11:18.006 --> 11:20.101
Hey, you can't just walk off like that.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.400
- What do you want? Who are you?
- My name is Melinda Gordon.

11:22.508 --> 11:24.303
- Who are you?
- Gabriel Lawrence.

11:24.406 --> 11:26.201
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Look, you know what?

11:26.306 --> 11:31.601
You and me have something that we need
to talk about, don't you think?

11:31.705 --> 11:35.100
I promise I won't bite.

11:35.507 --> 11:37.401
So where did you live
before you came here?

11:37.506 --> 11:40.900
Denver. Yeah, a small neighborhood
called Rosemont.

11:41.006 --> 11:43.601
When my parents died,
my uncle John took me in.

11:43.708 --> 11:46.203
We traveled all over,
every corner of the world.

11:46.308 --> 11:47.502
Did your uncle know?

11:47.605 --> 11:48.701
No, no.

11:48.806 --> 11:52.100
I realized pretty fast that this
was something I had to keep to myself,

11:52.205 --> 11:54.800
and so stopped trying,
learned to live with it.

11:54.905 --> 11:57.702
Besides, I didn't care
if people understood me.

11:57.807 --> 11:59.802
You know, I never really
trusted the living anyway.

11:59.907 --> 12:03.703
The dead made much better friends.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.802
So did you have,
regular dead friends?

12:06.908 --> 12:09.603
Absolutely.

12:10.107 --> 12:15.800
When I was a kid, I'd invite
my ghost friends for sleepovers.

12:16.008 --> 12:19.400
Yeah, I took 'em with me to school,
camping, trips.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.302
I'd cry when they would
finally cross over.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.403
I wished they would
stay with me forever.

12:23.505 --> 12:25.403
I was afraid to acknowledge them.

12:25.507 --> 12:29.200
I mean, not the ghosts, but I was
afraid what other people would think.

12:29.305 --> 12:30.502
Me, too.

12:30.608 --> 12:34.803
You tell people anything, you're
a thief, you have a contagious disease,

12:34.907 --> 12:37.403
you know the meaning of life,
but nothing...

12:37.505 --> 12:40.702
quite matches the look you get
when you say you can see ghosts.

12:40.805 --> 12:42.301
Exactly.

12:42.407 --> 12:46.901
It's like people always think
that you're after something.

12:47.006 --> 12:50.103
Are you after something, Gabriel?

12:50.206 --> 12:51.600
I mean, come on.

12:51.707 --> 12:54.202
The two of us living in the same town.

12:54.306 --> 12:56.903
It's a little weird.
You have to admit it.

12:57.006 --> 13:02.001
Maybe, but I have a different
weird threshold than most.

13:02.108 --> 13:03.402
Well, don't you?

13:03.508 --> 13:08.002
Have you noticed a shift
in the spirit world?

13:08.108 --> 13:11.702
- Is this a test?
- Maybe.

13:12.307 --> 13:14.702
Uh, actually, I have,

13:14.806 --> 13:18.600
like they're getting stronger.

13:19.207 --> 13:21.100
You felt it, too?

13:21.205 --> 13:22.903
Yeah. They can do more.

13:23.006 --> 13:27.701
It's like they can affect us
in ways they couldn't before.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.402
Like the flight attendant.

13:30.506 --> 13:33.300
Look, when that plane
came down, there was...

13:33.406 --> 13:35.502
a very dark spirit here

13:35.606 --> 13:39.901
who was trying to get as many souls
as possible to stay earthbound.

13:40.005 --> 13:43.900
He was able to convince a lot of souls,
including her, that...

13:44.007 --> 13:45.603
they belonged here,

13:45.808 --> 13:47.801
that there was something
they were meant to do.

13:47.905 --> 13:49.800
Now she's terrified of crossing over.

13:49.907 --> 13:53.400
I just think she doesn't know
who to trust.

13:53.506 --> 13:56.802
There's something keeping her
from crossing.

13:56.908 --> 13:58.603
Maybe she could talk to me again.

13:58.707 --> 14:04.001
- Now, that I know...
- Us. Maybe she could talk to us.

14:04.207 --> 14:05.903
I'm not trying to take over
your corner.

14:06.007 --> 14:07.200
I don't have a corner.

14:07.307 --> 14:10.900
I just have history with this spirit.

14:11.007 --> 14:14.603
Well, strength in numbers.

14:30.408 --> 14:32.601
Are you gonna get that?

14:32.706 --> 14:35.002
Rick.

14:36.407 --> 14:38.601
Yes.

14:38.905 --> 14:40.102
Yes. Hello.

14:40.207 --> 14:42.302
I met him.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.302
Yep. He was at our house.

14:44.407 --> 14:45.703
Seems great...

14:45.806 --> 14:47.200
funny, smart.

14:47.306 --> 14:49.803
Yeah. And he's a double capricorn.
He likes long walks on the beach.

14:49.907 --> 14:52.702
Skip the personal ad.
Is he the real deal or not?

14:52.805 --> 14:55.503
I think so.

14:56.307 --> 14:59.400
So what do you guys talk about?
Just compare notes, talk shop?

14:59.507 --> 15:01.302
In a way.

15:01.407 --> 15:03.601
I don't know if I can
totally trust him yet.

15:03.708 --> 15:06.102
You know, I have a weird thing
about coincidences.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.003
You're so suspicious.
I love that about you.

15:08.108 --> 15:12.901
Then again, that's what
I love about me, so...

15:14.005 --> 15:17.201
We're gonna go back to
where it all started.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.700
Plane crash site, tomorrow night.

15:20.807 --> 15:23.301
See if we can find
the flight attendant.

15:23.407 --> 15:25.900
Tomorrow night.

15:26.006 --> 15:29.102
You're not thinking of going out
with her tomorrow night, are you?

15:29.208 --> 15:31.100
I can't go tomorrow night.
I have a lecture.

15:31.207 --> 15:32.902
Oh, good, 'cause you're not invited.

15:33.005 --> 15:36.303
Well, good, 'cause
you're not invited, either.

15:36.407 --> 15:37.703
I'll let you know how it goes.

15:37.808 --> 15:41.703
Good night.

16:11.405 --> 16:15.300
It's weird being up here again.

16:17.007 --> 16:19.003
Think she'll be here?

16:19.107 --> 16:23.101
I like to go back to the beginning,
where they died.

16:23.205 --> 16:25.601
Sort of like me in that way...

16:25.708 --> 16:27.700
go after them, try to help 'em.

16:27.805 --> 16:30.801
I don't exactly go after them.
They usually come to me.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.200
I like finding them.

16:32.307 --> 16:33.801
I like chasing them, too.

16:33.906 --> 16:35.901
Sometimes I compete with myself,

16:36.006 --> 16:40.202
how many can I send off in one night.

16:41.707 --> 16:44.103
Your husband's a good man.
He understands you.

16:44.205 --> 16:47.400
Yeah. I'm very lucky.

16:47.505 --> 16:52.002
Never known anyone I could trust that way.

16:53.007 --> 16:56.500
- I'm not going back.
- Where?

16:56.605 --> 16:59.402
To that place with those people.

16:59.507 --> 17:01.400
I think it was hell or something.

17:01.506 --> 17:05.201
Are there spirits still
blocking the light?

17:05.307 --> 17:08.200
Maybe you have some unfinished business
or someone who

17:08.307 --> 17:09.702
you need to say good-bye to.

17:09.805 --> 17:11.102
There's no one.

17:11.207 --> 17:12.801
You must have some family.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.603
I never wanted any of that.

17:14.707 --> 17:17.602
How about your parents?

17:17.705 --> 17:20.602
They wanted me to be just like them,

17:20.704 --> 17:21.902
to never leave,

17:22.007 --> 17:24.300
and I wouldn't, so now they hate me.

17:24.407 --> 17:25.801
No, they don't.

17:25.905 --> 17:30.100
They do, because I left, and I died.

17:31.207 --> 17:33.403
Amy,

17:34.007 --> 17:36.300
I know what it's like to be alone,

17:36.408 --> 17:38.801
to have no attachments,

17:38.907 --> 17:41.802
no one pulling on your heart.

17:41.906 --> 17:45.702
You and I are more alike than you know.

17:45.807 --> 17:51.900
There's a difference between being
lonely and being alone, am I right?

17:52.007 --> 17:54.303
You just have to decide

17:54.407 --> 17:57.900
that you don't wanna be
alone like that anymore,

17:58.007 --> 18:00.103
and whatever blocks the light now

18:00.208 --> 18:02.803
will move.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.503
Amy,

18:05.608 --> 18:08.702
I can show you a place

18:08.808 --> 18:12.401
where you'll be very happy.

18:13.007 --> 18:15.703
Who's that?

18:18.206 --> 18:22.001
Please don't let them find me.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.903
Gabriel!

18:43.806 --> 18:47.003
Stop! He is my friend!

18:47.206 --> 18:48.402
Look, I'm sorry. I...

18:48.507 --> 18:50.801
I didn't mean to scare you off.
I just... I couldn't resist.

18:50.906 --> 18:53.003
- What the hell is this?
- It's a kirlian camera.

18:53.108 --> 18:54.702
It measures auras. It's nothing.

18:54.808 --> 18:58.302
- That's property of the university.
- Is this some kind of a joke, huh?!

18:58.407 --> 18:59.600
Some kind of cheap trick?!

18:59.708 --> 19:01.402
Look, I didn't know
he was gonna be here, I swear.

19:01.506 --> 19:05.601
Now you know why I prefer the dead.

19:09.908 --> 19:14.101
You're not gonna believe what I saw.

19:16.307 --> 19:19.001
I can't believe you followed me.
What are you, 12?

19:19.105 --> 19:20.400
It was in the name of science.

19:20.508 --> 19:22.203
Listen, my lecture let out at 5, so...

19:22.307 --> 19:24.002
Do you have any idea
what this makes me look like?

19:24.105 --> 19:26.600
Yeah, tell me about it. I was running
like a girl, holding this camera.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.902
I fell down. That guy grabbed me,
and he almost...

19:29.006 --> 19:30.200
Thank goodness he didn't
break this camera,

19:30.308 --> 19:31.602
'cause this thing is not cheap,
and I am.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.301
Did you notice he's got
quite a temper on him?

19:33.405 --> 19:35.403
Yeah. You always seem to
bring out the best in people.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.503
Yeah, I consider myself sort of
like a truth serum,

19:37.608 --> 19:40.703
except without the needles
or the C.I.A.

19:40.805 --> 19:45.103
All right, luckily,
I always keep a backup.

19:45.207 --> 19:46.900
You remember our friend?

19:47.005 --> 19:49.603
- Kirlian camera?
- Yeah. It reads auras.

19:49.706 --> 19:54.500
Energy fields, like the kinds
your friends the spirits give off.

19:54.607 --> 19:56.302
Here you go.

19:56.408 --> 19:58.802
- Would you like to guess
what those are? - Spirits.

19:58.905 --> 20:01.502
Spirits. Spirits!
This place is lousy with 'em!

20:01.608 --> 20:03.002
Yeah. It's a haunted field.

20:03.105 --> 20:06.403
There are lots of spirits that
didn't cross over in the plane crash.

20:06.508 --> 20:08.903
Oh, well, how come kirlian can
see them all and you can't?

20:09.006 --> 20:11.002
You know why?
Because that sees energy,

20:11.106 --> 20:14.602
and spirits can choose to manifest.
I can't make them show themselves.

20:14.708 --> 20:18.403
All right. Really? Well,
why don't you take a closer look.

20:18.505 --> 20:21.203
Here you go.

20:21.808 --> 20:24.703
Look at these orbs around him.
They follow him wherever he goes.

20:24.806 --> 20:29.601
They're attached to him.
When he chased me, they came with him.

20:29.708 --> 20:33.802
Look at that.
Those are his ghosts.

20:48.107 --> 20:50.503
I came to apologize for last night.

20:50.605 --> 20:53.602
I sort of lost it,

20:53.707 --> 20:57.700
and I want us to start over again.

21:05.808 --> 21:10.300
There's something
I want you to see first.

21:11.407 --> 21:12.501
They're spirits.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.201
Attached to you.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.802
How do you know
they're not attached to you?

21:15.907 --> 21:17.200
Stop playing with me.

21:17.308 --> 21:19.102
- Why don't you trust me?
- I don't know why.

21:19.207 --> 21:20.102
But you don't.

21:20.207 --> 21:22.401
Why did you come to Grandview?

21:22.508 --> 21:24.900
Did you know that I was here?

21:25.005 --> 21:28.301
I came here because
I felt I had to be here.

21:28.407 --> 21:30.403
I was drawn here.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.500
Maybe it was you.

21:34.805 --> 21:37.203
Or maybe it was them.

21:37.306 --> 21:42.102
Maybe it's just because
I feel I can help here.

21:42.308 --> 21:43.502
Look,

21:43.608 --> 21:45.002
we have to work together.

21:45.105 --> 21:47.603
All right, we were both
put here for a reason.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.502
- We have to find out what it is.
- How?

21:50.607 --> 21:52.403
Find your flight attendant,

21:52.505 --> 21:56.200
and we need to know
what she sees on her side.

21:56.307 --> 22:02.602
If you wanna work with me, meet me
tonight at the funeral home at 9:00.

22:16.205 --> 22:18.702
Maybe I was too hard on Gabriel.

22:18.806 --> 22:22.803
I mean, he does try to help spirits.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.903
He even goes and looks for them,

22:25.005 --> 22:28.300
unlike me, who tries to avoid them
whenever I can.

22:28.408 --> 22:30.802
That's because...

22:30.908 --> 22:33.502
he doesn't have anything else.

22:33.605 --> 22:35.600
Who am I to judge him...

22:35.708 --> 22:37.101
or not to trust him?

22:37.205 --> 22:39.800
Do you have any idea
who this guy really is?

22:39.907 --> 22:42.402
- Have you checked on him?
- There's no phone listing.

22:42.507 --> 22:45.401
Not here, before that,
before Grandview. Didn't he...

22:45.506 --> 22:48.300
- Didn't he say something about Denver?
- Yeah. He said he lived with his uncle.

22:48.406 --> 22:50.200
He told me his name, but...

22:50.308 --> 22:52.602
John.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.903
Right. Right.

22:55.008 --> 22:57.300
John.

23:09.205 --> 23:12.500
Ok. There's only one John Lawrence,
and he's a

23:12.608 --> 23:17.302
doctor and the director
at Rosemont hospital.

23:17.905 --> 23:19.403
Rosemont.

23:19.507 --> 23:22.703
That's where Gabriel said he lived.

23:22.806 --> 23:25.800
I realize it's just about
quitting time where you are,

23:25.907 --> 23:27.900
but I really need to
speak to dr. Lawrence.

23:28.006 --> 23:32.800
It's urgent that I speak with him.
I promise that I'll be very brief.

23:32.906 --> 23:34.202
I thought so.

23:34.308 --> 23:37.300
Thank you, yes. I will hold.

23:37.406 --> 23:40.901
- Isn't it a little late?
- I'm sorry. It'll just be a minute.

23:41.007 --> 23:43.201
- Isn't this what you have an office...
- Thank you.

23:43.308 --> 23:45.003
- Hello.
- Dr. Lawrence?

23:45.105 --> 23:45.900
Yes. Who is this?

23:46.007 --> 23:49.800
Hi. My name is professor Richard Payne,
Rockland university.

23:49.905 --> 23:53.502
Your nephew Gabriel Lawrence applied
for a job here in my building,

23:53.606 --> 23:55.603
so I wanted to call and
ask you some questions,

23:55.706 --> 23:58.101
just so I could fill in some
of the blanks on his application.

23:58.206 --> 24:00.500
I don't have a nephew.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.801
Well, that's not what
my papers here tell me.

24:03.906 --> 24:07.403
It says Gabriel Lawrence is your
nephew. He's mid-twenties, he's dark,

24:07.505 --> 24:09.303
and you raised him from
the time he was 9 years old.

24:09.407 --> 24:12.200
I think you might be talking
about Gabriel Hastings.

24:12.307 --> 24:15.001
He's not my nephew.
He was my patient.

24:15.107 --> 24:16.703
Sorry, did you say, "patient"?

24:16.806 --> 24:20.401
This is a psychiatric hospital.
He came to us as a child.

24:20.505 --> 24:23.902
He basically grew up here,
but I really shouldn't say too much.

24:24.008 --> 24:26.602
With all due respect, doctor,
I think I have every right in the world

24:26.708 --> 24:30.800
to know whether or not the person
I'm about to hire is dangerous.

24:30.906 --> 24:33.401
He was severely delusional as a child,

24:33.506 --> 24:39.501
came a long way, and he was released to
his own custody when he became an adult.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.501
That's really all I can say.
Please tell him to call me.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.501
Will do. Thank you. Bye-bye.

24:44.607 --> 24:48.002
So much for uncle John.

24:48.508 --> 24:50.401
Hey, what's the matter?

24:50.505 --> 24:52.802
That could have been me.

24:52.908 --> 24:57.102
Severely delusional,
kid that sees ghosts.

24:57.205 --> 25:00.403
I wonder how many people there
are like that,

25:00.506 --> 25:03.203
you know, who just get put away
because of what they can do.

25:03.308 --> 25:05.100
Melinda, this is nothing like you, ok?

25:05.206 --> 25:07.502
This guy went psycho
because he saw ghosts.

25:07.605 --> 25:09.601
I know. I just don't know
what to believe.

25:09.706 --> 25:12.903
And I have to talk to him,
'cause maybe I can help him.

25:13.005 --> 25:16.102
No. No, I forbid it.
No, you cannot.

25:16.205 --> 25:21.001
This isn't a stray dog, Melinda.
This guy's trouble, ok?

25:21.108 --> 25:25.101
Let's take a break. I'm thirsty.
I'm really thirsty. Who wants a drink?

25:25.207 --> 25:28.300
- Not me.
- I will.

25:32.508 --> 25:35.102
He's very concerned about you.

25:35.205 --> 25:38.400
I remember when he used to be
that concerned about me.

25:38.505 --> 25:42.301
Must've lasted at least the first
few weeks of our marriage.

25:42.405 --> 25:46.100
I'm sorry, but it's really
not what it seems.

25:46.206 --> 25:47.603
It's all right.

25:47.705 --> 25:51.701
Doesn't really matter now anyway.

25:52.306 --> 25:55.303
So what's our next step?

25:55.406 --> 25:58.300
You know, this is really
none of my business, but...

25:58.407 --> 26:02.303
why didn't you tell me
your wife was dead?

26:02.406 --> 26:04.401
Because I don't deal with it very well.

26:04.505 --> 26:07.103
Maybe it's time to.

26:07.207 --> 26:11.602
- What happened to her?
- It's nothing. She died in her sleep.

26:11.705 --> 26:14.300
That is so him.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.300
I was killed driving past
a construction site.

26:17.406 --> 26:21.602
A crane collapsed onto my car.
I was trapped for over 2 hours,

26:21.707 --> 26:26.302
and I died just before
they cut me free, but...

26:26.406 --> 26:30.703
it's too tough for him to think about.

26:31.508 --> 26:34.202
She's here.

26:35.505 --> 26:36.901
Why?

26:37.005 --> 26:38.801
I kept a journal.

26:38.905 --> 26:41.601
Third shelf behind the textbooks.
He should read it.

26:41.705 --> 26:47.101
She has a journal, third shelf.
She wants you to read it.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.000
I knew it.

26:50.105 --> 26:55.402
I just knew it. Things have been moving
around for months, and I hear her.

26:55.506 --> 27:00.303
I smell her perfume
when I come home sometimes.

27:00.507 --> 27:04.100
Just make sure he reads it.

27:04.706 --> 27:08.603
There are things he should know.

27:13.408 --> 27:16.101
She's gone.

27:17.107 --> 27:21.203
She really wants you
to read that journal, ok?

27:21.306 --> 27:24.902
You call me if you need to.

29:22.507 --> 29:25.002
Help me.

29:46.307 --> 29:47.803
Hey,

29:47.907 --> 29:49.201
glad you made it.

29:49.308 --> 29:52.003
So much that's about to happen.

29:52.106 --> 29:55.501
It's a great party, huh?

29:55.607 --> 29:56.802
Miss, please.

29:56.907 --> 29:59.201
Where you been?

29:59.308 --> 30:02.003
You're the only reason
I wish I wasn't dead.

30:02.108 --> 30:03.803
I'm not crossing over!

30:03.905 --> 30:06.303
Party!

30:19.206 --> 30:22.802
So how long you been dead?

30:31.007 --> 30:33.103
You stood me up.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.601
What is this?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.502
What are you doing
with all these spirits?

30:36.606 --> 30:37.803
Having fun.

30:37.907 --> 30:39.403
They're my family.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.700
You can't do this. You can't just
keep them all trapped here.

30:42.807 --> 30:46.902
Trapped? They're anything but trapped.
They're more free than they've ever been.

30:47.007 --> 30:48.701
You lied to me.

30:48.808 --> 30:49.401
Did I?

30:49.505 --> 30:52.601
Yeah. I spoke to your uncle John,
who was never your uncle.

30:52.706 --> 30:54.003
So what?

30:54.107 --> 30:56.401
- You would lie, too, in my place.
- No, I wouldn't.

30:56.508 --> 30:58.003
Come on, Melinda.

30:58.105 --> 31:01.200
This thing we do makes us liars.

31:01.305 --> 31:03.502
You lie every single day,

31:03.605 --> 31:07.200
every time you make an excuse for
why you're talking to yourself

31:07.305 --> 31:11.002
or when you backpedal to explain
how you know something you shouldn't

31:11.108 --> 31:15.003
or when you're looking
right at somebody

31:15.107 --> 31:17.700
that no one else can see.

31:17.806 --> 31:20.000
Lying is second nature to us.

31:20.105 --> 31:22.003
Lying...

31:22.107 --> 31:24.802
is survival.

31:25.008 --> 31:30.103
Is that what got you out
of the institution? Lying?

31:31.405 --> 31:34.801
You bet your ass it is.

31:41.805 --> 31:43.902
Look, I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

31:44.006 --> 31:46.503
I didn't grow up with
a family like yours.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.000
I don't have a partner like you have.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.802
My support system was a tray of me
to make it all go away.

31:51.907 --> 31:53.501
Look, you owe it to them
to cross them over.

31:53.608 --> 31:58.200
- And you owe it to the families...
- Don't tell me what I owe the living.

31:58.306 --> 32:02.502
There has never been one living person
who made me feel I was worth anything,

32:02.605 --> 32:07.002
who made me feel I wasn't
just some nut to be locked away.

32:07.107 --> 32:09.800
I'm here for the dead, not the living.

32:09.905 --> 32:13.100
They know they can trust me,
and they know I trust them.

32:13.207 --> 32:16.700
This isn't just some
lonely hearts club, Melinda.

32:16.807 --> 32:17.701
We're getting ready.

32:17.807 --> 32:20.603
- For what?
- For what's coming.

32:20.707 --> 32:22.800
We're blocking the light,

32:22.906 --> 32:25.800
and soon no one's gonna get through.

32:25.907 --> 32:30.400
These aren't your grandmother's
ghosts anymore.

32:30.507 --> 32:33.001
We're kindred souls, you and I,

32:33.105 --> 32:35.200
2 sides of the same coin.

32:35.306 --> 32:39.802
Just imagine how powerful we'd be
if we linked up.

32:39.907 --> 32:44.401
Or you could just risk
losing everything.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.602
What are you saying?

32:46.707 --> 32:50.102
I want you to leave your life.

32:50.207 --> 32:53.202
Why do you think we met?

32:53.307 --> 32:55.602
You said it yourself.

32:55.707 --> 32:59.301
This can't be an accident.

33:19.507 --> 33:23.100
Please take me out of here.

33:23.708 --> 33:26.603
- Do you see a light?
- No.

33:26.706 --> 33:31.003
Well, look for it.
You have to want it.

33:31.807 --> 33:33.003
I see it.

33:33.107 --> 33:36.403
There are still people in front of it.
I can't get close.

33:36.508 --> 33:39.001
I think that's because you're
scared and confused.

33:39.107 --> 33:40.400
They're using it against you.

33:40.507 --> 33:42.203
So what do I do?

33:42.308 --> 33:45.702
Can you think of anybody,
like a grandparent or friend who

33:45.808 --> 33:47.800
might still be in the light?

33:47.905 --> 33:51.302
I've never really lost anyone.

33:51.407 --> 33:55.001
Even my dog is still alive.

33:55.508 --> 33:58.600
Ok. Well, you know what?

33:58.707 --> 34:01.003
Why don't you think of yourself
as a little girl,

34:01.108 --> 34:05.700
8 or 9, you know.
Maybe it's your birthday party.

34:05.808 --> 34:07.800
We always had a birthday party.

34:07.908 --> 34:09.103
With your parents?

34:09.206 --> 34:11.202
Yeah, my aunts and uncles.

34:11.304 --> 34:14.101
Do they make you feel safe and loved?

34:14.206 --> 34:17.400
Yeah. I looked forward to it all day.

34:17.507 --> 34:19.402
They're all watching me now.

34:19.505 --> 34:22.802
They're smiling at me.

34:23.206 --> 34:26.802
Do you feel like nothing bad
could ever happen to you?

34:26.907 --> 34:30.001
Yeah, like they're always
gonna keep me safe.

34:30.105 --> 34:32.802
They loved me so much.

34:32.906 --> 34:36.701
They can't block you
when you feel those things.

34:36.804 --> 34:38.402
You're right.
They're starting to move.

34:38.505 --> 34:40.199
The light's getting bigger.

34:40.306 --> 34:42.800
So there's nothing stopping you now.

34:42.907 --> 34:45.203
Go into it.

34:45.306 --> 34:47.699
It is so beautiful.

34:47.804 --> 34:52.303
Now I can see everything
there is to see.

35:01.105 --> 35:02.503
Ok.

35:02.607 --> 35:06.402
Crossed her over going 60,
and never took my foot off the gas.

35:06.507 --> 35:11.402
How's that for your
grandmother's ghost, Gabriel?

35:16.106 --> 35:18.602
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me tonight.

35:18.707 --> 35:21.803
It ain't over yet.

35:34.607 --> 35:39.703
It was right where she said it
would be. Feel free to read aloud.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.800
"Almost told him tonight,

35:41.905 --> 35:43.803
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

35:43.906 --> 35:49.002
Should I just leave without
saying anything or just leave a note?

35:49.107 --> 35:52.302
Will he even notice?

35:52.606 --> 35:56.402
I keep waiting for him to tell me
that he knows about the affair.

35:56.506 --> 36:00.502
Could it be he actually doesn't?
Is he that unconscious? "

36:00.608 --> 36:03.801
- It gets better.
- I am so sorry.

36:03.905 --> 36:07.903
I don't understand the appeal
of this unfinished business.

36:08.007 --> 36:10.402
I think I would have been all right
without that piece of closure.

36:10.508 --> 36:13.603
It's like everything has
just turned upside down.

36:13.707 --> 36:15.402
Think Gabriel had something
to do with this?

36:15.506 --> 36:18.703
I went to Gabriel's house tonight,
and he had like this...

36:18.805 --> 36:22.101
I don't know. Army of souls
at some never-ending party.

36:22.208 --> 36:25.403
I knew the ghosts that were there,
'cause they hadn't crossed over.

36:25.507 --> 36:27.203
Was Kate there?

36:27.308 --> 36:29.002
I didn't see her.

36:29.108 --> 36:33.303
But there were others, you know,
from the plane crash, even before that.

36:33.407 --> 36:36.502
- Ghosts from the past?
- Yes.

36:36.606 --> 36:38.602
"When the forgotten return."

36:38.705 --> 36:42.400
"Death will be twice closer."

36:42.507 --> 36:43.702
Hello. Translation?

36:43.808 --> 36:45.200
It's the 5 signs.

36:45.306 --> 36:48.600
The dead dove on the doorstep.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.003
The bee.

36:51.107 --> 36:54.400
Writing on jim's back.

36:54.808 --> 36:57.100
What is it, Mel?

36:57.207 --> 36:58.903
The dead will rise.

36:59.006 --> 37:01.903
And now the forgotten have returned.

37:02.008 --> 37:03.603
So all 5 of those things have happened.

37:03.708 --> 37:07.203
No, not all of them. Not the writing
on your back, "mors dilecti".

37:07.306 --> 37:12.500
It was latin. It translates to
"death of a loved one".

37:13.505 --> 37:15.802
Ok, you know what?
We have to go and talk to Gabriel.

37:15.907 --> 37:17.502
You think Kate will be there?

37:17.605 --> 37:22.700
I don't know, but he better
tell us what's going on.

37:56.406 --> 37:58.903
Upstairs.

38:22.805 --> 38:25.301
In here.

38:52.305 --> 38:56.602
He's been watching you this whole time.

38:56.907 --> 39:00.100
Couple of pictures of you up here, Jim.
Few of me.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.103
I've always hated that picture of me.

39:02.208 --> 39:06.800
He's been planning this
for quite some time.

39:07.007 --> 39:11.000
No. This is bigger than just him.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.702
I hear someone.

39:29.407 --> 39:31.201
Kate?

39:31.306 --> 39:32.703
What are you doing here?

39:32.807 --> 39:34.202
She's here?

39:34.305 --> 39:35.803
He used me.

39:35.908 --> 39:38.001
- Who did?
- Gabriel,

39:38.106 --> 39:39.202
all of them.

39:39.307 --> 39:40.702
Where did they go?

39:40.808 --> 39:43.201
I don't know, but they left me here.

39:43.308 --> 39:45.502
Why?

39:47.506 --> 39:51.501
Because I feel so bad about what I did.

39:51.605 --> 39:55.200
I should never have hurt you
like that, Rick.

39:55.308 --> 39:59.401
I shouldn't have told you about
the diary, but they wanted me to.

39:59.507 --> 40:03.101
She's saying that Gabriel
wanted her to hurt you.

40:03.208 --> 40:06.402
He wants to hurt everybody
who helps you.

40:06.505 --> 40:07.601
Why?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.103
He wants to make you weak.

40:09.208 --> 40:12.200
Why is he collecting souls? Why
does he want them to stay earthbound?

40:12.308 --> 40:15.203
It's not just him.

40:15.308 --> 40:18.103
It's happening all over.
They're planning something.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.103
- Who is?
- Everyone on this side.

40:21.208 --> 40:24.000
What do they want?

40:24.108 --> 40:27.703
They want to make the dead
stronger than the living.

40:27.807 --> 40:29.302
They want to take over.

40:29.408 --> 40:31.202
What's happening, Melinda?
What is she saying?

40:31.306 --> 40:32.300
Wait.

40:32.406 --> 40:33.601
She'll tell you.

40:33.706 --> 40:37.300
I never meant for it
to be this way, Rick.

40:37.406 --> 40:39.701
I'm sorry.
Would you tell him I'm sorry?

40:39.807 --> 40:42.300
She's saying that she's sorry.

40:42.408 --> 40:44.702
Gabriel wanted her to hurt you

40:44.806 --> 40:47.102
because you're close to me.

40:47.206 --> 40:49.900
So it was all a lie, then,
the journal and the affair.

40:50.005 --> 40:52.203
No.

40:52.405 --> 40:55.202
No, that's true, and I'm sorry.

40:55.305 --> 40:56.800
Is that the only reason she haunted me?

40:56.905 --> 41:00.203
No. No, not at first.

41:01.606 --> 41:06.103
Just moving things around,
making noises,

41:06.505 --> 41:09.202
I just felt like I was getting
more of your attention dead

41:09.306 --> 41:11.701
than I did when I was alive.

41:11.805 --> 41:14.303
I just...

41:14.708 --> 41:18.201
I just wanted you to know
how lonely I felt.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.902
How much I loved you

41:21.006 --> 41:25.201
and needed you and hated losing you.

41:27.605 --> 41:30.201
And then...

41:30.308 --> 41:32.302
Gabriel found me,

41:32.408 --> 41:34.901
told me that I was gonna be punished

41:35.007 --> 41:36.702
for what I'd done
if I tried to cross over.

41:36.805 --> 41:42.600
He said I should stay here and help him.
He said then the pain would go away.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.302
What is she saying now?

41:44.406 --> 41:48.300
She was haunting you because
she wanted you to pay attention,

41:48.406 --> 41:51.601
and she knows that she made a mistake,

41:51.705 --> 41:57.100
and she feels terrible about it,
and that's why Gabriel left her behind.

41:57.205 --> 42:01.402
How did we let it get to this, Rick?

42:01.808 --> 42:04.401
I did love you.

42:04.506 --> 42:08.600
I know you love me.
I know you did.

42:10.105 --> 42:13.403
How did we lose that?

42:17.306 --> 42:20.001
Will you...

42:20.608 --> 42:23.801
Will you forgive me?

42:24.705 --> 42:28.103
She wants to know
if you can forgive her.

42:28.206 --> 42:33.101
It's what she needs to find peace
and cross over.

42:40.207 --> 42:42.401
No.

42:43.105 --> 42:45.402
What?

42:46.408 --> 42:48.601
No.

42:49.008 --> 42:50.503
I could say it, but I'd be lying.

42:50.608 --> 42:52.702
I could say the words
if that's what you want.

42:52.806 --> 42:55.802
You'll never get
another chance like this.

42:55.905 --> 42:57.303
You have to know that.

42:57.406 --> 43:01.101
No.

43:01.108 --> 43:03.000
She should have come to me.
We should've spoken about it.

43:03.105 --> 43:07.702
