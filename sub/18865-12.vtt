Johnny: Oh, Moira, kids...
this is so unnecessary.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.205
- What is it?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.841
- It's a gift from us
to your father.

00:09.876 --> 00:11.943
- Okay. Yeah, I rather not
attach my name to a gift

00:11.978 --> 00:13.812
that I had no hand in selecting.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.648
Oh, God.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.285
- Oh my God.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.087
Where'd you find this, honey?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.256
- Well, Moira told me it was
down at the post office--

00:24.291 --> 00:26.391
- I was talking to my wife.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.560
- The Van Housens found it
in their storage room

00:28.595 --> 00:30.729
and thought that we should
have it.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.164
- (Shocked gasps)

00:32.199 --> 00:34.032
Who's that in the back?

00:34.067 --> 00:35.867
- That's Moira.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.670
- Flattering.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.205
- It's a family portrait,
Roland.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.374
- Oh...you...

00:42.409 --> 00:44.309
You all look like cartoons.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.710
- Wow.
- It's so weird,

00:45.745 --> 00:47.145
I don't even remember
posing for this.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.547
- Because you didn't.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.148
You were in rehab
when we sat for this.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.250
- I wasn't in rehab,

00:52.285 --> 00:55.020
I was at rehab visiting Stavros.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.488
- Oh, that's right.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.391
We had your face painted
on the body of my assistant.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.560
- Hm. That's why
you look so good.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.161
- (Fake chuckle)

01:03.196 --> 01:05.330
- Well, I love it.

01:05.365 --> 01:07.265
Let's get this inside.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.301
David.
- Huh? What?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.071
- $20 bucks, I'll give you
a hand taking it in.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.273
- Oh yeah. David.
- What?!

01:15.308 --> 01:16.708
- $30 buck, I'll help you
in with it.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.143
- Right. David!

01:18.178 --> 01:20.212
- I don't know what!
What? What? What?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.613
What do you want?

01:21.648 --> 01:23.715
- $40 buck and I'll help you
in with in.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.217
I can keep going up.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.751
Can play this game all day, pal.

or if the portrait
is very, very big.

01:41.301 --> 01:44.769
- Well, I think it's quite
possible that both are true.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.037
- (Sighs)

01:46.072 --> 01:48.707
Do you think the Van Housens
had it enlarged?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.443
- No, this is the actual size.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.812
Remember, Reiner wanted
to paint it twice as big.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.081
- Oh, look at it, John.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.750
- Well, don't worry, we'll...
we'll find a place for it.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.720
You know, we can take things
off a wall,

02:01.755 --> 02:04.523
or rearrange some furniture.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.425
Maybe move some wigs.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.564
- Oh John, I know how nostalgic
you still get for the old days,

02:12.599 --> 02:16.468
and I just wanted to do
something thoughtful for you.

02:16.503 --> 02:19.538
- Oh, Moira, this portrait
is a wonderful reminder

02:19.573 --> 02:22.807
of your generous spirit

02:22.842 --> 02:24.743

02:42.429 --> 02:43.795
- No. Technically, I think
it's our juice

02:43.830 --> 02:45.797
because you just took it
from the fridge

02:45.832 --> 02:47.432

02:47.467 --> 02:48.934

you have a clean mouth so...

Yeah. Some people have nice,
clean mouths,

03:02.782 --> 03:05.884

have sloppy mouths.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.822
So, hey, I was thinking
about our launch party,

03:10.857 --> 03:13.592
and I think we should
take out like a full page

03:13.627 --> 03:15.360
in the local news,
and just make it-

03:15.395 --> 03:17.195

I just think if we're going
big, let's go big.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.338
- Yeah. 'Cause um,
'cause I was thinking

03:26.373 --> 03:28.139
what if we did like a soft
launch.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.342
Um, and you know, just test
the store out

03:30.377 --> 03:31.710
on a small group of people.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.412

03:35.949 --> 03:38.650
a friends and family discount
as incentive.

- Ha, now it's sounding like

03:40.120 --> 03:41.953
you don't think people
will show.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.622
- No, I do.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.024
I do think
that people will come.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.593
It's just, you know,
I look to like Gwyneth

03:48.628 --> 03:50.495
who soft-launched the goop
newsletter

03:50.530 --> 03:52.464

03:56.870 --> 03:58.603
Either way you need to call
the electrician

03:58.638 --> 04:01.673
to hang these lights that were
supposed to be up a week ago.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.508
- Yeah. Yeah. I was waiting

04:03.543 --> 04:05.510
I was waiting for a call back
from him.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.545
Hm. But you know
what I'm gonna do?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.014
I'm gonna follow up.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.548
- Sure.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.783
- Can I have my juice back,
please?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.718
- No. You've got a sloppy mouth.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.757
- Hey, did Mrs. Syzlak call?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.558
She's late for her appointment.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.794
- Um yeah. She cancelled.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.829
She said that her cat
is better.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.998
- She doesn't have a cat.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.967
- Okay. Sorry,
who am I thinking of?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.503
Um, somebody isn't coming
in today

04:31.538 --> 04:33.705
and someone's cat is better.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.875
Oh, and someone's something
may be worse...

04:38.311 --> 04:39.678
- Is everything okay?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.012
You usually take down
the messages,

04:41.047 --> 04:42.447
even if you forget to give
them to me.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.316
- It's just that my grades
are being posted today

04:44.351 --> 04:46.418
so I'm just kind of avoiding
the computer.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.553
- Oh. O-o-okay.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.755
Well, that's not really
an option

04:50.790 --> 04:53.558
so how about I just look
for you.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.827
- No, it's okay, I can do it.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.595
It's just that if I fail

04:57.630 --> 04:59.664
I may need the afternoon off.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.700
- Also not an option,

05:01.735 --> 05:04.102
but I will be here for you
if it's bad news.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.471
- Oh my God, Ted.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.506
I passed!
- Really?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.842
- Yeah. I got a 60 and a 65!

05:10.877 --> 05:12.744
- Alexis, those are the class
averages.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.113
You got a 63 and a 68!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.548
- Oh my God!

05:16.583 --> 05:18.116
(Happy laughter)

05:22.922 --> 05:25.223
- Well... Congrats.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.458
- Um. Thank you.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.728
Um, I'm just...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.696
I'm just gonna call Mrs. Syzlak.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.432
And just make sure that
her cat is doing okay.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.001
- It's Mrs. Syzlak and
she doesn't have a cat.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.036
But you should call her back.
and I, in the mean time,

05:38.071 --> 05:40.872
will go to get back to...
work-o.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.540
- Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.578
Hmm. Okay.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.717
- Hi, so I wanted to talk
to you about--

05:52.752 --> 05:54.319
Oh my God.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.720
- Yeah. I know.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.955
We're still looking
for a place to hang it.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.356
- Did it grow?

05:58.391 --> 06:01.259
Can we cover it with
something or...?

06:01.294 --> 06:02.927
- I tried. The sheets
aren't big enough.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.629
- Can we help you, David?

06:04.664 --> 06:06.531
- Uh, yes.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.933
Actually I wanted you to be
the first to know

06:08.968 --> 06:11.503
that Patrick and I will
be launching the store

06:11.538 --> 06:12.837
this Friday.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.239
- (Claps) Ooh!

06:14.274 --> 06:15.940
- Oh great new!
A grand opening.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.976
- Hm. We've doing more of
a soft launch.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.645
- I don't like the sound
of that.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.113
- Why?

06:22.148 --> 06:23.982
It's actually a very effective
business strategy.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.785
And it's always better
to go under.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.153
- Go under?
- No.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.854
- David, if the business
is foundering

06:29.889 --> 06:31.756
it's best to tell us now.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.825
- No! When it comes
to expectations

06:33.860 --> 06:36.928
It's always to go under
than over.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.596
- Yeah, I don't know
if that's true, son.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.232
Every Rose video we opened
had fireworks.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.268
Day or night.
People love pizzazz.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.236
- Okay, well, this is gonna
be the opposite of that.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.806
We're inviting a select
group of VIP's,

06:47.841 --> 06:51.209
and offering a 25 percent
friends and family discount.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.344
- Well, that sounds meek.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.646
- Okay.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.681
- Friends are getting the same
discount as family?

06:56.716 --> 06:58.016
That doesn't sound right.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.384
- Well, that's what we're doing.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.919
- Well, what if your mother
and I go in

07:00.954 --> 07:02.253
and buy something together?

07:02.288 --> 07:04.088
Does that mean we get
a 50 percent discount?

07:04.123 --> 07:07.759
- Why would you wanna spend
less money at my store?

07:07.794 --> 07:09.928
- David, we are happy to support

07:09.963 --> 07:12.230
this modest little vigil
you're hosting

07:12.265 --> 07:14.065
but to hand out discounts

07:14.100 --> 07:15.700
before the store
has even been birthed

07:15.735 --> 07:17.669
it sounds a tad defeatist.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.972
I hope you don't mind if I keep
this information to myself.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.107
- I don't want you
to share the news.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.310
The smaller the better.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.846
- Oh, rarely has that been
a recipe for success.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.114
- I'm really glad I came
in here.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.719
- We love you!
- Keep reaching, son!

07:36.155 --> 07:37.589
(Light knock)

07:38.958 --> 07:40.325
- Hello.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.826
Um, I called Mrs. Syzlak,

07:41.861 --> 07:43.127
and sorted it all out.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.562
She will be in tomorrow.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.564
So, I'm just gonna go back
to my desk.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.466
Which is where I work.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.470
- We should talk
about the kiss.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.138
- Definitely.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.941
Personally, I don't think
it was that a big deal.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.443
- Yeah. Neither do I.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.711
- We're adults.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.446
We should be allowed
to have an adult kiss

08:01.481 --> 08:02.847
from time to time.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.649
- Totally. An adult kiss.
- Yes!

08:04.684 --> 08:07.085
- Like when your parents kiss
their friends...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.853
on the mouth.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.289
- Yes. Like kissing your
parents.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.958
That's exactly what I was
going to say.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.527
- Yeah. I mean,
we're friends so...

08:15.562 --> 08:17.161
- Agreed.

08:18.598 --> 08:19.898
Oh! Here's something.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.332
Speaking of friend stuff.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.168
David is doing this friends
and family discount

08:24.203 --> 08:25.937
for his store opening.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.472
And I know that you love
discounts.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.241
So. I was thinking that maybe
we could go...

08:30.276 --> 08:31.809
- Yeah. That sounds--

08:31.844 --> 08:34.245
- As friends.
- Yeah.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.146
- I would go as family,
and you would go as friends...

08:35.181 --> 08:37.081
of the family.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.317
- Well, I do love discounts.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.487
That I had to delete groupon
from my phone last week.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.090
Just 'cause three vacuums
is enough... Vacuums.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.459
- Yeah. Cool. Okay.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.896
So um... Back to work-o.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.066
- Watch out! Oh.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.568
(Light thud) Oh!

08:56.603 --> 09:02.373
♪ ♪

09:05.612 --> 09:07.011
- Oh my God.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.513
- Isn't it something?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.315
Huh? (Chuckles)

09:10.350 --> 09:12.417
I always felt something
was missing in here

09:12.452 --> 09:14.118
and then it occurred to me

09:14.153 --> 09:16.020
that a lot of family-run
businesses

09:16.055 --> 09:18.957
hang a portrait of the family
in the workplace.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.459
- Oh. That reminds me,

09:21.494 --> 09:25.563
I've been meaning to have my
family portrait airlifted in...

09:25.598 --> 09:27.699
- Well, I know it's a little
arresting at first.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.968
But I think with time

09:30.003 --> 09:31.836
You won't even know it's here.

09:31.871 --> 09:35.473
- Hm. I don't think
that's gonna happen.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.844
- You don't look very
happy in this.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.646
- Well, it wasn't the style
to look happy.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.082
The motivation was
to look successful.

09:44.117 --> 09:48.086
You know this used to hang in
the great hall of our house.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.655
- Oh, now this seems a little
understated for a great hall.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.358
- I'd look at it every morning.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.227
The family often wasn't
all together back then,

09:56.262 --> 09:59.597
but I could look at this
and there we were.

09:59.632 --> 10:03.401
- Well, you're together
like all the time now.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.570
So who needs this, right?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
- Well, that's true.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.442
But this happens to be one
of the only possessions

10:11.477 --> 10:13.378
that wasn't sold off.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.682
- Really? You'd think there'd
be more of a market

10:17.717 --> 10:21.486
for oversized paintings
of other people's families.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.393
Why does it seem like
Mrs. Roses eyes

10:28.428 --> 10:30.161
are following me?

10:30.196 --> 10:31.829
- Oh, she paid extra for that.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.171
Twyla: Here you go.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.539
Two tuna melts.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.041
- Oh. I didn't order tuna melts,

10:43.076 --> 10:44.475
but I don't have time--

10:44.510 --> 10:46.811
- Oh, by the way,
I hope you don't mind,

10:46.846 --> 10:47.945
but I told a few people about
your big store opening.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.481
- Big store opening?

10:50.516 --> 10:52.650
- Isn't it a friends
and family sale.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.686
- Yes.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.891
Which is why you would be
invited as a friend.

10:59.926 --> 11:03.127
Um, who told you
about our little--

11:03.162 --> 11:04.662
- David,

11:04.697 --> 11:06.497
just the guy I wanted to see.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.133
Listen, Gwen wanted me
to ask you

11:09.168 --> 11:12.437
if we both have plus-ones
for the opening,

11:12.472 --> 11:15.173
or if we have to be each
other's plus-ones.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.874
- Who's Gwen?

11:16.909 --> 11:18.676
- (Laughs)

11:20.913 --> 11:22.313
That's very funny.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.849
- Oh, my mother's boyfriend
wanted to bring his secretary.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.150
- He did.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.120
Why not.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.521
Um, I'm gonna go.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.724
But I'm really glad that
someone told you.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.961
And Bob. And Gwen.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.531
(Car rumbles)

11:40.566 --> 11:42.467
(Footsteps thud)

11:42.502 --> 11:44.368
(Door creaks open)

11:44.403 --> 11:46.537
- Uh...

11:46.572 --> 11:49.674
how many people did
you tell about Friday?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.776
- Just the names on my
pre-approved list. Why?

11:51.811 --> 11:54.579
- Because I have been
approached by a lot of people

11:54.614 --> 11:56.614
who are not on the pre-approved
list.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.316
- Well, you know,
sometimes when you tell

11:58.351 --> 12:00.384
everyone that it's exclusive,

12:00.419 --> 12:02.019
then everybody just wants in.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.888
Like how many people
are we talking about?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.623
- Uh, I don't know.
Twyla's whole family.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.625
So, like, 75?

12:07.660 --> 12:09.026
- (Inhaling whistle)

12:09.061 --> 12:10.728
I should've ordered
more food and wine.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.397
Looks like this soft launch
is firming up a bit, huh.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.333
- But it's not supposed
to be firm.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.667
- Well, with this many people

12:16.702 --> 12:18.269
it's definitely at least
semi-firm.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.338
- Okay. Well, as long as it
doesn't get hard.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.706
And that's something,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.274
that's what I just said
to you, so...

12:27.380 --> 12:29.747
What?

12:29.782 --> 12:32.950
(Low hum of excited laughter
and chatter)

12:34.420 --> 12:36.654
Oh my God.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.090
- Hey, back of the line, bro!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.858
- Hey! No cutting!

12:40.893 --> 12:43.394
- Excuse me, this is my store.
Who are you?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.729
- I'm Darleen's cousin.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.197
Who the fuck are you?

12:46.232 --> 12:47.598
- My God.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.033
That kind of language, folks,

12:49.068 --> 12:52.103
will not be tolerated
at Rose Apothecary.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.472
Thank you.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.474
This is a safe place.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.609
(Doors creak open and shut)

12:58.644 --> 13:01.746
Uh, so I was just verbally
assaulted

13:01.781 --> 13:04.982
by a very off-brand customer
in line outside.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.586
- Well, David, I have really
underestimated you.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.521
- How so?

13:10.556 --> 13:11.989
- Who knew you had so many
friends.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.825
Or family members,
for that matter.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.793
- Okay. What do we do?

13:15.828 --> 13:17.361
I for one blame Gwyneth.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.865
- David, relax.
it's going to be fine.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.601
- Oh my God, the lights!

13:23.636 --> 13:25.136
I didn't call the electrician.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.737
(Light clicks on)

13:26.772 --> 13:28.639
- I watched a lot of youtube
tutorials.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.474
- This is very impressive.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.912
- Well, there's a good chance
I didn't wire that properly,

13:34.947 --> 13:35.813
so that's why I also
got the insurance

13:35.848 --> 13:37.982
that you forgot to get.
- Okay.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.184
Ah, there is only do so much
that I can do in a day.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.019
So... um...

13:43.456 --> 13:44.755
Are we ready for this?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.224
- Open the doors.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.992
- Okay...

13:51.230 --> 13:52.697
- Softly.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.232
- Okay.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.337
(Loud hum of chatter)

13:59.372 --> 14:00.872
(Jazz music plays)

14:03.309 --> 14:04.909
- Find everything okay?

14:04.944 --> 14:06.444
(Door creaks open)

14:06.479 --> 14:07.745
(Loud hum of chatter)

14:07.780 --> 14:09.513
(Jazz music plays)

14:09.548 --> 14:10.882
(Cash register rings)

14:10.917 --> 14:12.483
John: Wow.
Moira: Wow.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.786
- David did all this?

14:15.821 --> 14:17.488
- I can't believe it.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.424
He's managed to create
in this town

14:20.459 --> 14:22.693
something truly winsome.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.062
I would shop here, John.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.999
Even without a nagging
sense of obligation.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.637
- And look at, look at the
labels on everything.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.939
'Rose Apothecary.'

14:34.974 --> 14:38.910
- The Rose name on another
plucky young business.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.580
- We should go congratulate him.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.981
- We should.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.284
But our son is very hard
at work.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.926
- Here you go.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.627
And the scarf.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.798
- So um, this says foot cream
on it.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.733
What happens if I use it
on my hand?

15:02.768 --> 15:06.103
- Um, I'm pretty sure your
hands are gonna be fine.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.972
- Okay, and it's like
50 percent off

15:08.007 --> 15:10.341
if Jocelyn and I both
buy it at the same time?

15:10.376 --> 15:12.009
- Um, n-no.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.878
Have you been talking to my dad
about the discount?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.013
- Roly, you can bargain later.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.149
Um, David, I need to ask you
a little question

15:18.184 --> 15:20.885
about this baggy
of Joshua tree tea?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.453
- Sure.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.955
- Is it drugs?

15:23.990 --> 15:27.358
- Uh, no.
It's loose leaf tea.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.227
- Okay. Because it smells
exactly like--

15:30.262 --> 15:32.396
- (Sniffs)
Oh, come on! Wow!

15:35.101 --> 15:36.968
Geez, I didn't realize this
place was a front.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.769
- It's not a front.

15:38.804 --> 15:40.404
That is a tea that Mr. Hockley

15:40.439 --> 15:42.873
makes out of a greenhouse
on his farm.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.141
And now that I've said it
out loud,

15:44.176 --> 15:45.710
I might have to double check.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.144
- Hmm. Well, honey,

15:47.179 --> 15:49.981
why don't we grab a few bags
of Mr. Hockley

15:50.016 --> 15:51.916
- Okay then. I love tea.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.086
- Yeah, I'm a big tea
drinker now.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.355
I started drinking tea
in high school.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.025
(Birds chirp)

16:01.060 --> 16:02.493
- Cedar dragon.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.928
(Spritzes)

16:03.963 --> 16:05.429
(Sniffs) Hm. well,
that's different.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.365
What do you think?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.233
- Hm.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.435
You know? I don't know.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.005
I mean, it's nice
but I also, I don't know.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.107
I think you should probably
get it

16:16.142 --> 16:18.142
or not, whatever...

16:18.177 --> 16:20.444
- Oh! Look who's here!

16:20.479 --> 16:22.113
- Alexis! And...

16:22.148 --> 16:24.215
- Ted.
- Ted.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.117
- Good to see you,
Mr. and Mrs. Rose.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.886
I take it Alexis
has told you the big news?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.321
- Big news?

16:30.356 --> 16:32.823
- Uh, well, it wasn't that big
a deal,

16:32.858 --> 16:35.960
but the other day at work
Ted and I went to hug--

16:35.995 --> 16:39.597
- Actually I was talking about
you passing your exams.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.532
- Honey! You passed!

16:42.968 --> 16:44.735
(Laughing)

16:44.770 --> 16:48.239
- Alexis, what a delightful
surprise!

16:48.274 --> 16:50.007
Not that I'm surprised.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.876
I had nothing but doubts...

16:51.911 --> 16:54.111
No doubts.
That you could do this.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.548
- Well, I'm just glad
to be done.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.286
♪ ♪

17:02.321 --> 17:03.954
- Well, this has been quite
the day, Moira.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.457
- Mhm.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.292
- You know, I had an idea about
what to do with the portrait.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.529
- Oh, it's still there,
waiting for us.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.997
Isn't it?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.932
- I was thinking,
to save space,

17:14.967 --> 17:17.201
we could cut our faces out

17:17.236 --> 17:20.171
and make four smaller,
individual portraits.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.339
- We could,

17:22.374 --> 17:24.875
here's another thought:

17:24.910 --> 17:27.278
we bid it farewell.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.948
- Are you kidding?

17:32.651 --> 17:34.151
- It doesn't fit, John.

17:34.186 --> 17:37.154
And I don't just mean
literally.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.723
We aren't those people anymore.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.992
We are, but we aren't.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.661
- You know, you might be right.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.330
It's funny when I look
at that portrait now,

17:46.365 --> 17:48.332
I find myself wondering...

17:48.367 --> 17:50.935
Were we really that happy
back then?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.438
- Yes.
- We were.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.173
- Oh, deliriously happy.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.309
- I miss that beach house.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.211
- Oh my God, I still dream
that we wake up

18:00.246 --> 18:02.046
in our old bed.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.447
Nothing is changed.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.015
- No.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.218
No. We can't go down that road,
Moira.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.588
We have to focus on
what we do have.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.693
No?
- Yes.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.829
Yes.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.500
(Car rumbles)

18:28.474 --> 18:29.940
- Hey, Alexis? I, uh...

18:31.410 --> 18:33.277
- Oh, right.
You were going that way.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.579
- No, no. I want to say,

18:35.614 --> 18:37.181
that I got you a little
something

18:37.216 --> 18:38.749
for passing your exams.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.050
- Oh.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.288
Oh, Ted!

18:44.323 --> 18:46.323
You picked up a stick.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.593
- No, it's a pencil shaped
like a twig.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.562
I got it at the store.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.664
- Wasn't that was sneaky of you.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.066
I will definitely try
to use this.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.170
It looks very delicate.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.639
- Yes. A lot more expensive
than I thought too.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.407
I hate it when they don't
put price tags on things.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.977
- Thank you, Ted.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.517
Oh, no... I... I didn't mean.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.320
That was supposed to be like,

19:16.355 --> 19:18.355
like a thank you adult kiss.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.791
- Yeah, the thing is...

19:20.826 --> 19:24.228
I think maybe we should just
avoid kisses for a while.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.864
Even adult ones.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.365
- Of course.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.402
- Probably better
if we just adult hug

19:31.437 --> 19:33.938
and adult work together.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.140
- I totally get that.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.841
- Okay.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.677
- Great.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.614
Adult high five?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.482
(Hands clap)
- Yeah.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.860
(Light Jazz song plays)

19:58.397 --> 19:59.663
- Well, this was a success.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.765
- I would say so. Yeah.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.667
Although, you know,
we'd be 25 percent richer

20:03.702 --> 20:05.269
if we just done a hard launch.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.804
But hey, I'm just a numbers guy.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.038
- Mhm.

20:08.073 --> 20:09.573
Uh, but had we not done
the soft launch

20:09.608 --> 20:12.176
we wouldn't have lured
all those people.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.178
- Hm. Well, you know,
the best thing is

20:14.213 --> 20:15.679
that we never have
to talk about it again

20:15.714 --> 20:17.248
because we've officially open.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.550
- That is true.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.151
- Congratulations, man.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.886
- Congratulations to you.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.292
(Lights flicker)

20:30.562 --> 20:32.029
- I can fix that.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.297
- Okay. Yeah.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.666
I was just gonna say that
that might need fixing.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.737
- Well, it fits here.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.573
- I wonder what else
the Van Housens took from us.

20:42.608 --> 20:43.907
- Don't waste your time thinking

20:43.942 --> 20:45.776
about those human vultures.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.078
- I think they did us a favor.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.446
They sent us a reminder

20:49.481 --> 20:52.683
that it's not always good
to hold onto the past.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.885
- Speak for yourself,
I look super cute.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.820
- Okay, that's not actually
your body though.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.822
- Okay, but it's my face, David.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.424
- Okay, let's go.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.795
- There's something really
weird happening

21:04.830 --> 21:07.564
with mom's eyes.
It's like they're following me.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.366
- Oh, they are.
- Oh God.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.868
- (Chuckles)
