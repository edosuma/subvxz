for weeks for that fall.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.927
Yeah, she's Jessica Alba's stunt double.

08:19.963 --> 08:22.129
RUDY: All right, Meanie.
We've got you outnumbered.

08:22.165 --> 08:24.065
- Okay, I give up!
- Really?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.566
Yeah, I know when I'm beat.

08:25.602 --> 08:27.668
Just gonna get a quick
sarsaparilla for the road.

08:27.704 --> 08:29.236
Make it real quick.

08:29.272 --> 08:30.338
Oh, I will.

08:30.373 --> 08:31.472
Fling!

08:31.507 --> 08:32.974
Ow!

08:33.009 --> 08:34.442
You jerks. (crying)

08:34.477 --> 08:36.943
Hey, can I get my badge and key back?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.245
Uh, thank you.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.513
Mom, you got Meanie.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.182
You fought my battles for me.

08:41.217 --> 08:42.950
(gasps) Mom?

08:42.986 --> 08:44.184
Mom?

08:44.220 --> 08:45.720
No!

08:45.755 --> 08:47.054
She got me, Rudy.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.289
She got me right in the gut.

08:48.324 --> 08:49.390
But...

08:49.425 --> 08:51.125
I think this is it for me.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.160
But, no.

08:52.195 --> 08:53.661
Damn these rubber bands.

08:53.884 --> 08:55.529
Damn them to hell!

08:55.565 --> 08:57.498
What will I do without you?

08:57.533 --> 08:58.599
Oh, Rudy.

08:58.635 --> 08:59.600
You'll live.

08:59.636 --> 09:01.302
'Cause I raised you to live.

09:01.337 --> 09:03.304
(crying)

09:03.339 --> 09:06.140
Always remember how great your mom was.

09:06.417 --> 09:10.259
And always remember to
breathe harder than others.

09:10.313 --> 09:12.736
Adios, much...

09:13.116 --> 09:14.715
(wheezing): ... chacho.

09:14.751 --> 09:17.685
She's got asthma, too.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.420
(crying)

09:19.455 --> 09:21.122
(deep, wheezing breath)

09:21.157 --> 09:23.991
(coughing and crying)

09:24.027 --> 09:27.328
LOUISE: The town with no moms was
gonna have to go by a different name.

09:27.363 --> 09:30.095
Because of one mom,
who saved all the moms,

09:30.120 --> 09:32.333
they named it Momtown.

09:32.368 --> 09:33.567
(sneezes)

09:33.603 --> 09:34.669
Momtown.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.504
What a tearjerker.

09:36.539 --> 09:38.205
I know. You can see why I haven't

09:38.241 --> 09:39.573
been doing my homework lately.

09:39.609 --> 09:42.176
I've been so focused on that play.

09:42.211 --> 09:45.137
It was very impressive
to see, in person.

09:45.162 --> 09:46.414
Yeah. (whistles)

09:46.449 --> 09:48.082
Mm-hmm. (whistles)

09:48.117 --> 09:49.880
Tina, what'd your class do?

09:49.905 --> 09:53.421
Um, it's all so fresh, I'm still
kind of remembering what we did.

09:53.456 --> 09:55.511
But Gene's got that
"Let me go next" face.

09:55.536 --> 09:56.394
Do I?

09:56.419 --> 09:57.625
You definitely do, Gene.

09:57.660 --> 10:02.163
We did kind of a skit song
with xylophones and clouds.

10:02.198 --> 10:04.498
It was called "Eternally Maternal."

10:04.534 --> 10:06.100
Ooh, a skit song.

10:06.135 --> 10:08.602
I was completely in
sync with everyone else,

10:08.638 --> 10:09.921
in case you were wondering.

10:09.946 --> 10:11.272
Ah. Sure.

10:11.307 --> 10:13.340
GENE: I played a god named Yingo.

10:13.376 --> 10:16.110
My brothers Yango and Yongo and I

10:16.145 --> 10:18.612
created the universe
and everything in it.

10:18.648 --> 10:20.548
We made clouds, TV, breadsticks,

10:20.583 --> 10:21.716
unlimited breadsticks.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.772
We had it good, real good.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.487
Hey, check out what I made
with the Staff of Creation.

10:26.522 --> 10:27.688
A banana-ffalo.

10:27.724 --> 10:29.962
It's half banana, half buffalo.

10:29.987 --> 10:32.159
Wait, what mythology is this?

10:32.195 --> 10:33.594
Uh, it's kind of a mishmash.

10:33.629 --> 10:36.497
Greek, Roman, Pokémon,
Tex-Mex, you know.

10:36.532 --> 10:37.565
Sure, sure.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.166
Anyway.

10:39.202 --> 10:41.736
Boy, do we have it good, except...

Yeah. We need, uh, healthy limits.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.835
Hey, uh, Yingo. Let me see that Staff
of Creation real quick. No reason.

11:14.871 --> 11:16.646
Oh, okay, sure.

11:17.082 --> 11:19.540
Ha, ha, ha! You're never creating a mom.

11:19.575 --> 11:20.708
Hey, give it back.

11:20.743 --> 11:22.488
No. (grunts)

11:22.513 --> 11:24.423
GENE: And they played
Keep Away over the audience

11:24.447 --> 11:25.513
and people went crazy.

11:25.548 --> 11:28.644
I'm throwing this across the universe.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.489
(grunts) No!

11:31.942 --> 11:33.886
LINDA: Oh, that Yango and Yongo.

11:33.911 --> 11:35.110
Why don't they want a mom?

11:35.145 --> 11:36.812
- Little punks.
- I know.

11:36.847 --> 11:38.613
Yingo's pretty great, though, right?

11:38.649 --> 11:40.660
Gene, go on with your
incredibly accurate accounting

11:40.684 --> 11:42.150
of what happened earlier tonight.

11:42.186 --> 11:44.052
I will. There I was,

11:44.087 --> 11:47.211
searching the universe
for the Staff of Creation.

11:47.236 --> 11:50.539
Ugh! Why did I have to
make the universe so huge?

11:50.564 --> 11:51.860
I can't find anything.

11:51.895 --> 11:53.128
I want that staff.

11:53.163 --> 11:55.258
I want to have someone like a mom.

11:55.283 --> 11:57.165
COURTNEY: You mean like me?

11:57.201 --> 11:59.034
(angelic voices sing)

11:59.069 --> 12:02.070
Wait, how'd you create her
without the Staff of Creation?

12:02.105 --> 12:03.839
I didn't. She's a vision.

12:03.874 --> 12:05.166
Ooh, vision.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.808
But if I was real,

12:06.844 --> 12:08.743

Mombo, you're fading.

12:41.879 --> 12:43.545
Because I'm not real.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.113
I'm just a vision.

12:45.148 --> 12:46.581
(quietly): Vision, vision.

12:46.617 --> 12:48.717
I need that Staff of Creation!

12:48.752 --> 12:50.118
You don't need the staff.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.820
You just need to believe.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.088
If you believe,

12:53.123 --> 12:55.724
put your hand under
your armpit and squeeze.

12:55.759 --> 12:56.825
(fart noise)

12:56.860 --> 12:58.593
It makes a funny sound.

12:58.629 --> 13:00.729
That's the sound of believing.

13:00.764 --> 13:03.131
Everyone, believe with me.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.267
(fart noises)

13:05.302 --> 13:06.668
(thunder crashes)

13:06.703 --> 13:08.336
There was thunder and lightning

13:08.372 --> 13:09.971
and crashing cymbals.

13:10.007 --> 13:11.740
And steel drums, I want to say.

13:11.775 --> 13:13.275
And Mombo became real.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.343
And everyone was dancing on the ceiling,

13:15.379 --> 13:18.013
and this was way before Lionel Richie.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.214
I'm real.

13:19.249 --> 13:20.916
This is amazing.

13:20.951 --> 13:23.184
I'm so much better than a dad.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.319
What's a dad?

13:24.354 --> 13:26.121
Oh, let me tell you about dads.

13:26.156 --> 13:28.290
They're hairy, they've got no rhythm,

13:28.325 --> 13:31.070
they can't tape a school
play to save their lives,

13:31.095 --> 13:33.662
they smell weird, their
knees are backwards...

13:33.697 --> 13:35.130
Okay, Gene, we get it.

13:35.165 --> 13:37.132
(humming)

13:37.167 --> 13:38.600
Oh, that's catchy.

13:38.635 --> 13:40.484
And the production sounds impressive.

13:40.509 --> 13:41.670
All those wires.

13:41.705 --> 13:42.904
Yeah, that's the crew kids.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.180
They don't want speaking roles.

13:44.207 --> 13:46.141
They express themselves through pulleys.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.944
Okay, I think I'm ready to
remember what my class did.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.613
Ooh, all right. (retches)

13:51.648 --> 13:54.049
We did a little play called
"Moms Are out of This World".

13:54.084 --> 13:55.984
It took place out of this world.

13:56.019 --> 13:57.752
TINA: I played a tough
lady named Sigourney,

13:57.788 --> 14:00.355
with a complicated backstory
and a great jumpsuit.

14:00.390 --> 14:02.958
I was on a mission with a
couple spunky space marines

14:02.993 --> 14:05.742
to wipe out an incredibly
dangerous alien species

14:05.767 --> 14:07.992
that had a thing for jumping
out of people's chests.

14:08.017 --> 14:09.601
- LINDA: Yuck.
- TINA: I know, right?

14:09.626 --> 14:12.499
In order to exterminate the aliens,
we have to take out their queen.

14:12.524 --> 14:13.671
Which won't be easy.

14:13.707 --> 14:15.673
Yeah, it will, 'cause we got the guts.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.942
And we got the tools. Ha! Come on.

14:17.978 --> 14:19.944
Yeah, take that, alien.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.446
We'll need to be careful and brave,

14:21.481 --> 14:22.981
because this alien is super tough.

14:23.016 --> 14:24.515
It's got acid for blood,

14:24.551 --> 14:26.329
so it can hurt you even
after you've killed it.

14:26.353 --> 14:28.164
- Which is annoying.
- Like stepping on a dead bee.

14:28.188 --> 14:30.288
Y'all ever done that? One time...

14:30.323 --> 14:32.068
TINA: But before they entered
into the fight of their lives,

14:32.092 --> 14:33.625
they had to do something real quick.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.137
... that stinger's
about four inches long.

14:35.161 --> 14:36.439
We could trip over these space crates.

14:36.463 --> 14:37.913
I'd better move 'em.

14:37.938 --> 14:39.308
Let me just strap
into this super strong,

14:39.332 --> 14:41.231
robotic exoskeleton loader.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.022
Hold on a second.

14:43.047 --> 14:44.670
Uh, yeah, sure.

14:44.695 --> 14:46.616
TINA: Maybe this will
come back later. Who knows?

14:46.640 --> 14:48.072
LINDA: Robotic loader?

14:48.108 --> 14:49.139
Flamethrowers?

14:49.164 --> 14:51.354
What kind of budget did
you have for these plays?

14:51.378 --> 14:53.591
Mmm. I think it was about $50,000.

14:53.616 --> 14:56.614
- They fired a gym teacher.
- And we had a bake sale.

14:56.650 --> 14:58.416
Okay. Let's get this mother.

14:58.451 --> 14:59.617
Oh.

14:59.653 --> 15:01.452
Also, I forgot to tell you.

15:01.488 --> 15:04.188
There are reports of scientific
anomalies on this planet.

15:04.224 --> 15:07.425
- A-Anomalies?
- Yeah. Scientific ones.

15:07.460 --> 15:09.127
Because of the, uh,

15:09.162 --> 15:11.029
terraforming... station.

15:11.064 --> 15:12.697
And the hyper unit something.

15:12.732 --> 15:14.499
Uh, all right.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.367
What are these things? Space tulips?

15:16.403 --> 15:18.069
Negative. Those are pods.

15:18.104 --> 15:19.370
With alien babies in 'em.

15:19.406 --> 15:21.139
We have to take out the alien queen mom,

15:21.174 --> 15:22.573
if we can figure out where she is.

15:22.609 --> 15:24.042
- Uh...
- Oh, there she is.

15:24.077 --> 15:25.343
(screams)

15:25.378 --> 15:27.078
Game over, man. Game over.

15:27.113 --> 15:28.379
(Zeke grunts)

15:28.415 --> 15:30.281
TINA: This was a big moment

15:30.317 --> 15:32.650
when we revealed the
alien queen costume/puppet.

15:32.686 --> 15:34.752
There were a lot of kids
working behind the scenes

15:34.788 --> 15:37.288
to make this thing look
like an egg-laying monster.

15:37.324 --> 15:38.423
Some parents screamed.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.590
One lady fainted.

15:39.626 --> 15:41.092
Dad, talking about you.

15:41.127 --> 15:42.438
Damn it! How am I supposed to kill you

15:42.462 --> 15:44.006
when these trained
space marines couldn't?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.997
- You're so strong.
- Whatever.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.166
How am I supposed to
not be killed by you

15:48.201 --> 15:51.002
with your flamethrower and
your advanced technology?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.370
You're so smart.

15:52.405 --> 15:54.005
What? That's crazy.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.440
You're the perfect organism.

15:55.475 --> 15:57.075
Ugh. You have it so much easier than me.

15:57.110 --> 15:58.343
Nuh-uh.

15:58.378 --> 16:00.278
I have slimy hands and two weird mouths.

16:00.313 --> 16:02.280
Your hands are only a little slimy

16:02.315 --> 16:03.781
and you came here on a spaceship.

16:03.817 --> 16:06.017
You have it easier than me.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.686
BOTH: I wish I could be you for a day.

16:08.722 --> 16:10.488
TINA: And then we switched bodies.

16:10.523 --> 16:12.233
I mean, you know, we switched costumes.

16:12.258 --> 16:14.258
But the idea was, we switched bodies.

16:14.294 --> 16:15.493
We body-switched!

16:15.528 --> 16:16.850
(gasps) The anomaly.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.014
Wait, what?

16:18.039 --> 16:19.451
The scientific anomaly.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.199
Because of the terraforming...

16:21.234 --> 16:23.701
- hyper unit something.
- Whatever.

16:23.737 --> 16:25.981
Hey, check out my hair when I run.

16:26.006 --> 16:27.271
Ah.

16:27.307 --> 16:28.573
I thought this was Alien.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.069
Now it's a body-switching story?

16:30.094 --> 16:32.019
It's Freaky Friday-liens.

16:32.044 --> 16:34.078
I remember all of this.

16:34.114 --> 16:35.680
Me, too. But, uh, what happens again?

16:35.715 --> 16:37.582
Tina, go on, go on.

16:37.617 --> 16:39.317
TINA: I was the queen,
and I decided to take

16:39.352 --> 16:40.718
my new body out for a spin.

16:40.754 --> 16:42.064
I jumped. I whipped my tail around.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.187
I climbed a wall.

16:43.223 --> 16:44.322
The big three.

16:44.357 --> 16:45.757
Ah.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.592
Super cool.

16:47.627 --> 16:49.460
(alien baby cries)

16:49.496 --> 16:51.562
Huh? Oh, a baby. Right.

16:51.598 --> 16:53.698
I'm totally a mom.

16:53.733 --> 16:56.067
Aw, look at you.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.469
You probably want a host
body to suck the life out of.

16:58.505 --> 17:00.371
(shushing)

17:00.407 --> 17:02.106
Don't shush me. (continues crying)

17:02.142 --> 17:04.175
Okay. I'm going to put you back

17:04.210 --> 17:05.777
- in your egg-a-majig.
- (babies crying)

17:05.811 --> 17:08.813
Oh, more babies. I have so many babies.

17:08.848 --> 17:11.848
(groaning): I don't know how to
take care of all these babies.

17:11.885 --> 17:15.038
Ah... Mommy's gonna
be back in just a sec.

17:16.422 --> 17:19.709
- Man, that alien sure was tough.
- I know.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.983
- And so totally smoking hot.
- Do what?

17:23.009 --> 17:24.837
Yeah, I wouldn't say it was hot.

17:24.872 --> 17:26.338
I mean, it wasn't ugly, but...

17:26.374 --> 17:28.422
Yeah, it was ugly. It was a monster.

17:28.454 --> 17:30.680
That seems closed-minded.

17:30.705 --> 17:32.555
Sigourney, you're acting weird.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.279
Weird like cool weird?

17:34.315 --> 17:35.948
Like I just got a lot cooler recently?

17:35.983 --> 17:37.116
Um...

17:37.151 --> 17:38.684
Psst.

17:38.719 --> 17:40.030
(whispering): Can I
talk with you real quick?

17:40.054 --> 17:42.078
Ugh. Back in a sec, guys.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.757
I just got to go, um,
stretch my human legs out.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.191
I'll be right back.

17:46.227 --> 17:48.127
- I want to switch back.
- What? Already?

17:48.162 --> 17:49.617
No way.

17:49.642 --> 17:51.208
Come on. It's hard being in your body.

17:51.232 --> 17:53.098
I'm loving being in your body.

17:53.134 --> 17:54.833
It's so much more compact.

17:54.869 --> 17:56.335
And I love these eye guards.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.904
- I feel like they make me look smart.
- Uh-huh, but...

17:58.939 --> 18:00.372
And human boys, I love them.

18:00.408 --> 18:02.531
They have so few teeth. It's cute.

18:02.556 --> 18:05.244
Listen, we got to say "I want
to switch back" at the same time,

18:05.279 --> 18:06.812
so the scientific anomaly can happen.

18:06.847 --> 18:08.280
Ready? And...

18:08.315 --> 18:10.649
- I want to switch back.
- I'm not switching back.

18:10.685 --> 18:12.151
(sighs) I was afraid of this.

18:12.186 --> 18:14.053
Um, I'm gonna have to
force you to switch back

18:14.088 --> 18:15.387
with my alien strength.

18:15.423 --> 18:17.122
- (growls)
- Ow.

18:17.158 --> 18:18.924
TINA: And then it was a full-on battle

18:18.959 --> 18:20.993
with that loader you
might remember from before.

18:21.028 --> 18:22.995
How do you even use this thing?

18:23.030 --> 18:24.396
Um, you just hold onto the...

18:24.432 --> 18:26.398
- Never mind, I got it.
- Okay, good.

18:26.434 --> 18:29.301
(grunting)

18:29.336 --> 18:31.403
TINA: So we were
fighting. And the audience

18:31.439 --> 18:33.216
was really into it, and
they weren't just being nice

18:33.240 --> 18:35.107
'cause it was a school play. Right, Dad?

18:35.142 --> 18:37.643
It was... it was...

18:37.678 --> 18:39.945
It was like Avenue Q meets Caligula

18:39.980 --> 18:41.914
meets a fight outside of a Dairy Queen.

18:41.949 --> 18:43.415
Yes. Right. E-Exactly.

18:43.451 --> 18:46.085
- Wait, you saw Caligula?
- You saw Caligula?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.352
Wait, what's Caligula?

18:47.388 --> 18:49.922
Come on, I don't want to hurt you.

18:49.957 --> 18:51.390
- Switch back.
- No.

18:51.425 --> 18:53.058
(grunts)

18:53.094 --> 18:54.782
(growls)

18:54.807 --> 18:56.895
I'm never changing back.

18:56.931 --> 18:58.731
(alien babies cry)

18:58.766 --> 19:01.133
- Sweeties?
- (alien babies cry)

19:01.168 --> 19:03.302
Aw. They need me.

19:03.337 --> 19:04.937
(sighs) Okay, let's switch back.

19:04.972 --> 19:06.171
Oh, phew.

19:06.207 --> 19:07.306
But after we switch back,

19:07.341 --> 19:08.774
my babies will need a host body

19:08.809 --> 19:10.375
to feed off of as a life source.

19:10.411 --> 19:11.877
Will you be that host body?

19:11.912 --> 19:13.278
Um, maybe?

19:13.314 --> 19:14.858
I mean, after we switch.
Let's switch first.

19:14.882 --> 19:16.014
Okay.

19:16.050 --> 19:18.177
One, two, three...

19:18.202 --> 19:20.511
BOTH: I want to switch back.

19:22.289 --> 19:24.456
- Come here, alien babies.
- (babies crying)

19:24.492 --> 19:26.191
Come to mama.

19:26.227 --> 19:28.026
- Ow.
- Okay, bye.

19:28.062 --> 19:29.995
I'll get back to you
about that host body thing.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.997
Everyone lived happily ever after.

19:32.032 --> 19:34.247
Then the crew kids struck the
set real fast and that was that.

19:34.368 --> 19:35.434
So, wow.

19:35.469 --> 19:36.869
There you have it, Lin.

19:36.904 --> 19:38.303
Pretty much how it went at school.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.205
You mean exactly much.

19:40.241 --> 19:42.935
Oh, my God. I can't believe I missed it.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.701
If I was as strong as those
mothers in your stories,

19:45.726 --> 19:47.713
I would have gone and
just sneezed all over

19:47.748 --> 19:49.381
everyone's dumb faces.

19:49.416 --> 19:51.936
What? Mom, you are the
mothers in those stories.

19:51.961 --> 19:53.428
- I am?
- Yeah.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.388
You would take a rubber
band to the gut for us.

19:56.423 --> 19:58.390
You stand up for us all the time.

19:58.425 --> 19:59.639
Well, yeah, I guess.

19:59.664 --> 20:01.928
And you're not a god,
but you're god-like.

20:01.953 --> 20:03.362
That's true.

20:03.397 --> 20:06.198
And you're a badass
protective queen bee alien

20:06.233 --> 20:07.800
with acid for blood, right?

20:07.835 --> 20:09.168
Kinda, yeah, maybe.

20:09.203 --> 20:10.736
And you'd forgive your husband

20:10.771 --> 20:12.271
for messing up on some videotaping.

20:12.306 --> 20:15.474
- Geez, Dad. Got to weasel in, huh?
- Trying.

20:15.509 --> 20:17.776
Get in here. Mother's Day weekend hug.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.378
I don't think we should be touching.

20:19.413 --> 20:20.846
(phone buzzes)

20:20.881 --> 20:23.081
Hey. The school just sent a link

20:23.117 --> 20:24.732
to a recording of the performance.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.118
Oh. Um...

20:26.153 --> 20:27.419
Should we watch it?

20:27.454 --> 20:29.021
KIDS: Uh...

20:29.056 --> 20:31.079
You know what? I don't want to watch it.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.859
I already know I like
your version better.

20:33.894 --> 20:37.111
Got to say, this was a pretty
great Mother's Day gift.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.269
What else did you get me?

20:38.294 --> 20:40.161
KIDS AND BOB: Uh...

20:41.269 --> 20:44.504
LINDA: ♪ Oh, what a feeling ♪

20:44.529 --> 20:48.164

21:10.501 --> 21:12.960
Everyone's upside-down.
The blood's rushing to my head.
