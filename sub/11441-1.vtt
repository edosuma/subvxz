WEBVTT

00:53.156 --> 00:54.865
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

00:55.533 --> 00:59.369
<i>A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?</i>

01:15.011 --> 01:17.137
<i>A moment of pain, perhaps.</i>

01:26.397 --> 01:29.441
<i>Something dead
which still seems to be alive.</i>

01:39.786 --> 01:42.662
<i>An emotion suspended in time.</i>

01:47.710 --> 01:49.711
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

01:59.597 --> 02:02.182
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

03:48.497 --> 03:51.541
THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE

04:06.974 --> 04:09.225
We'll be there soon.

05:10.121 --> 05:11.579
What the...?

05:27.888 --> 05:31.391
It fell quite a while ago,
but it never exploded.

05:32.351 --> 05:35.895
They came, they defused it,

05:36.022 --> 05:39.190
and they left it there.
Nobody can move it.

05:46.866 --> 05:48.616
Follow me, please.

05:51.287 --> 05:52.996
Carlos...

05:53.122 --> 05:56.207
Wait for me here. We won't be long.

05:58.753 --> 06:00.378
Who are those people outside?

06:00.504 --> 06:03.214
The caretaker
and two men who help him.

06:05.426 --> 06:08.636
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.389
They're building a chicken coop.

06:21.817 --> 06:23.526
What's going on out there?

06:25.029 --> 06:27.947
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Dominguez again?

06:30.284 --> 06:32.202
Yes. Ayala's wounded.

06:34.455 --> 06:36.498
They're always in trouble.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.668
They've brought another boy.

06:48.052 --> 06:50.553
As if we didn't have
enough already.

06:55.684 --> 06:57.227
Let's go.

08:18.058 --> 08:19.851
Are you a new kid?

08:22.396 --> 08:24.564
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?

08:25.900 --> 08:29.485
I'm Galvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he sure sees a lot.

08:30.905 --> 08:32.488
I'm Carlos.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.952
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?

08:38.996 --> 08:41.748
No, but I've got
some comics and toys.

08:41.874 --> 08:43.707
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.

08:45.794 --> 08:49.505
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.

08:49.632 --> 08:52.634
I can barely feed the ones
who are here. I'm sorry.

08:55.095 --> 08:57.764
He's the son of a comrade
killed at the front.

08:58.807 --> 09:01.768
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.

09:01.894 --> 09:04.520
Your husband was a leftist,
a brave man.

09:04.647 --> 09:07.232
Oh, no! I'm the brave one.

09:08.192 --> 09:10.735
Ricardo was a man of books,
of ideas.

09:11.445 --> 09:14.822
He decided to die and leave me here
to defend his ideals.

09:16.659 --> 09:19.869
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.414
Reds looking after Reds' children.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.291
Not to mention this!

09:26.335 --> 09:29.420
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy...

09:29.546 --> 09:31.381
take the rest of the gold.

09:32.216 --> 09:33.925
There are 10 ingots left.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.843
At least you can buy guns.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.888
I can't even buy bread with it.

09:39.014 --> 09:41.724
- Take it away.
- We can't.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.560
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.

09:44.687 --> 09:47.605
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.

09:52.278 --> 09:54.904
Class time! Come on!

10:01.245 --> 10:02.954
Look, Owl, a comic book!

10:04.832 --> 10:06.749
I'll swap you.

10:08.377 --> 10:11.796
Look at this marble.
It's my favourite. It's from China.

10:12.423 --> 10:14.257
Or look at this one.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.342
Owl made it himself.

10:16.468 --> 10:19.637
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.

10:21.765 --> 10:23.808
Hey, you! That's mine!

10:23.934 --> 10:26.019
- Are you here to stay?
- No.

10:26.770 --> 10:28.646
Then why are you here?

10:29.398 --> 10:31.607
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.

10:33.235 --> 10:36.946
- What the hell's a tutor?
- He looks after me when my father's away.

10:37.072 --> 10:40.867
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.

10:41.577 --> 10:44.120
Take the comic from me. Go on.

10:44.246 --> 10:46.122
Take it away. Come on.

10:53.339 --> 10:54.922
Carlos, look!

10:56.759 --> 10:58.426
Mr Ayala.

11:02.431 --> 11:04.807
Your tutor's leaving you, you queer!

11:39.134 --> 11:43.262
Stay with him for a while.
He seems quite meek.

11:44.139 --> 11:45.890
I'm sure you'll get along.

12:02.950 --> 12:04.826
We'll have to fix it.

12:06.954 --> 12:08.496
The Count of Monte Cristo.

12:09.665 --> 12:12.166
Has Edmond Dantes
broken out of prison yet?

12:13.502 --> 12:17.004
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.

12:17.131 --> 12:19.841
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.

12:19.967 --> 12:22.218
Why don't you read on,
then tell me?

12:25.139 --> 12:29.142
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.

12:29.268 --> 12:31.602
She teaches maths and reading.

12:32.062 --> 12:35.022
And the elegant lady you saw,
remember?

12:35.149 --> 12:36.941
Her name is Carmen.

12:37.067 --> 12:39.777
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.

12:39.903 --> 12:41.821
Why did they leave me here?

12:43.532 --> 12:47.076
- Why can't I be with my father?
- Carlitos...

12:47.202 --> 12:50.496
You're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.249
So be patient.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.549
Your soap has to last you all year.

13:02.050 --> 13:03.593
Be careful with it.

13:03.719 --> 13:06.596
Or you'll be punished
with two weeks of extra tasks.

13:09.433 --> 13:12.560
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.

13:28.494 --> 13:30.369
This is your bed.

13:30.496 --> 13:32.079
Number 12.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.542
Why are there so many empty beds?

13:36.668 --> 13:39.504
Some boys run away,
but I wouldn't advise it.

13:40.714 --> 13:44.675
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...

13:53.727 --> 13:55.353
For your locker.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.397
Do you understand?

13:58.857 --> 14:01.901
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.

14:21.255 --> 14:23.214
See where they put the new kid?

14:25.717 --> 14:27.843
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!

14:36.270 --> 14:39.438
Pig and I think that
even though you complain a lot...

14:39.565 --> 14:41.232
you're all right here.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.443
Far away from the war,
well hidden.

14:45.195 --> 14:46.946
Well looked after.

14:47.573 --> 14:49.824
- What could be better?
- Granada.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.952
Why go to Granada?

14:53.078 --> 14:54.704
We're getting married.

14:56.081 --> 14:58.416
We'll buy a farm.

15:00.168 --> 15:01.752
Sure.

15:02.212 --> 15:03.796
Granada!

15:05.841 --> 15:09.343
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?

15:09.469 --> 15:11.345
I don't need anyone.

15:12.973 --> 15:15.516
I've managed fine
on my own so far...

15:16.018 --> 15:17.643
Right.

15:17.769 --> 15:19.103
And without parents.

15:22.608 --> 15:26.694
- Those Reds were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.

15:26.820 --> 15:29.071
That's why they eat so well here...
too much gold.

15:30.657 --> 15:33.826
You don't believe me now,
but you will.

15:34.703 --> 15:37.997
I'll try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.

15:38.123 --> 15:41.083
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?

15:42.336 --> 15:44.754
- No.
- All right, so long.

15:56.183 --> 15:58.017
I don't like those two.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.229
They make me sick.

16:03.273 --> 16:05.399
This place makes me sick.

16:10.739 --> 16:12.365
When I was a kid...

16:13.367 --> 16:16.869
I'd stand here
in the middle of the yard...

16:17.371 --> 16:20.164
and I'd look up at the sky.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.126
I dreamed of getting out of here.

16:24.711 --> 16:26.379
I prayed to become rich...

16:26.505 --> 16:29.173
so I could buy this dump
and tear it down.

16:30.676 --> 16:32.426
Forget it now.

16:40.394 --> 16:42.895
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.

16:45.148 --> 16:47.108
Well, I'm glad you came back.

16:55.450 --> 16:58.244
Let's go to my room.
It's getting cold.

18:01.099 --> 18:03.768
San... ti...

18:31.880 --> 18:33.380
Who are you?

19:52.210 --> 19:53.627
What are you doing?

19:53.753 --> 19:56.922
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.926
The fucking new kid
spilled our water.

20:07.350 --> 20:08.809
Come on.

20:09.561 --> 20:11.854
You'll have to get more
from the kitchen.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.898
Isn't that off limits?

20:14.024 --> 20:16.358
No one's ever been caught.

20:16.484 --> 20:18.485
What about the "one who sighs"?

20:19.946 --> 20:22.948
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?

20:23.074 --> 20:24.950
Who's the "one who sighs"?

20:28.079 --> 20:30.664
- You're chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.042
You're a shit, a queer.

20:34.377 --> 20:36.420
All right, I'll go.

20:36.546 --> 20:38.964
But you're coming with me.

20:39.090 --> 20:41.175
We'll each fill a jug.

20:42.302 --> 20:44.470
But if you're scared...

21:09.704 --> 21:11.747
They say it's switched off.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.750
But I don't believe it.

21:18.797 --> 21:21.924
Put your ear against her,
you'll hear ticking.

21:25.845 --> 21:27.721
That's her heart.

21:28.181 --> 21:30.099
She's still alive.

21:31.810 --> 21:34.061
And she knows we're here.

21:36.982 --> 21:38.816
Hide!

22:04.009 --> 22:05.968
That one.

22:33.705 --> 22:35.080
Come on.

23:14.788 --> 23:16.747
See you outside.

24:26.234 --> 24:29.069
"No one's ever been caught. "
Bastard.

26:00.245 --> 26:01.745
Shit!

27:37.091 --> 27:38.258
Hello?

28:52.834 --> 28:54.626
Who are you?

28:55.920 --> 28:58.004
Do you live down here?

29:50.683 --> 29:54.644
Many of you will die.

30:15.958 --> 30:17.626
Jaime!

31:38.874 --> 31:40.709
What are you up to?

31:54.140 --> 31:58.059
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.

31:58.185 --> 32:01.396
"It flatters pity...

32:01.522 --> 32:05.567
"It flatters pity not to be able to hide.

32:08.112 --> 32:10.530
"Let your lips bear witness

32:10.656 --> 32:12.949
"to the blaze in your heart.

32:13.075 --> 32:16.828
"No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.

32:16.954 --> 32:20.332
"He who cares for his well-being
keeps not his feelings silent.

32:22.877 --> 32:25.503
"My grief is greater than I.

32:26.047 --> 32:28.381
"And that being so,

32:28.507 --> 32:33.887
"it will be easier...

32:34.764 --> 32:36.848
"for it to defeat me...

32:36.974 --> 32:39.517
"than for me to command it.

32:42.563 --> 32:46.232
"Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.

32:46.359 --> 32:50.111
"He is not a brave prisoner
who dares not break down his jail. "

33:16.597 --> 33:18.348
A grain of strength.

33:29.694 --> 33:34.114
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?

33:38.911 --> 33:41.162
He's not going to tell.

33:42.707 --> 33:45.625
He'll squeal in the end.
Just wait and see.

33:45.751 --> 33:47.627
You understand?

33:49.588 --> 33:51.631
Then, for the last time,

33:52.591 --> 33:55.760
who was with you last night?

33:55.886 --> 33:57.887
I was alone.

34:01.434 --> 34:03.601
That boy won't talk.

34:03.728 --> 34:06.396
If we want to know
who was with him,

34:07.982 --> 34:11.525
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.

34:11.652 --> 34:13.402
Perfect.

34:13.529 --> 34:16.822
Very well. You may begin.

34:23.748 --> 34:27.417
They think Carlos has told,
but they don't care.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.670
They're ravenous.
Look at how they're eating.

34:32.089 --> 34:36.092
The first one to look up
from his plate is his accomplice.

34:38.929 --> 34:43.516
Marcos, Galvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here!

34:47.480 --> 34:49.856
I knew you wouldn't squeal.

34:49.982 --> 34:52.192
Dr Casares tricked me.

34:52.318 --> 34:54.527
Just what I said.

34:55.737 --> 34:58.198
It isn't your fault we were punished.

34:58.991 --> 35:02.160
- Dr Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!

35:05.623 --> 35:07.457
Careful.

35:08.167 --> 35:10.126
Come on, Owl.

35:12.004 --> 35:15.423
Shit, for a dead guy,
he sure weighs a lot!

35:19.136 --> 35:20.970
Well, well!

35:21.096 --> 35:24.349
Christ in the yard
and John the Baptist in here.

35:24.934 --> 35:27.352
Are things that bad?

35:27.478 --> 35:31.314
If the new Spain
is Catholic and apostolic...

35:34.777 --> 35:36.569
Try it now.

35:44.078 --> 35:46.037
I told you.

35:46.789 --> 35:48.832
- Dance with me.
- No.

35:48.958 --> 35:52.126
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.

35:53.045 --> 35:54.963
I can't dance.

36:02.221 --> 36:04.180
Ayala said so.

36:05.391 --> 36:07.350
Catalonia is about to fall.

36:08.394 --> 36:11.396
Then Madrid will fall, and then...

36:14.859 --> 36:17.318
There's talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?

36:17.444 --> 36:19.362
Yes.

36:19.864 --> 36:23.074
Sometimes I think
that we are the ghosts.

36:23.742 --> 36:27.954
Galvez, last night, you didn't shoot.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.164
That's right.

36:32.793 --> 36:35.461
- Wow, that's great!
- It's for you.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.887
Why are they laughing?

36:45.514 --> 36:47.056
Fuckers.

36:53.314 --> 36:56.107
Go back to Argentina,
while you still can.

36:56.233 --> 36:58.693
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.

36:59.361 --> 37:02.780
England or France
might still intervene.

37:04.283 --> 37:06.951
That's just wishful thinking.

37:07.077 --> 37:09.412
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.

37:10.205 --> 37:12.498
No, I'm not like him.

37:12.625 --> 37:15.627
Twenty years ago,
I found the place for me.

37:19.298 --> 37:21.257
And I stayed.

37:22.092 --> 37:23.968
That's all.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.472
Look at it jump!

37:32.937 --> 37:34.812
Where's the new kid?

37:46.241 --> 37:48.743
Are you the "one who sighs"?

37:51.622 --> 37:53.706
Do you live down there?

37:57.419 --> 37:59.128
Listen.

38:07.930 --> 38:10.932
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr Casares.

38:11.058 --> 38:12.934
Arse-licker!

38:15.896 --> 38:18.189
Throw him down! Go on!

38:24.780 --> 38:26.781
He can't swim!

38:46.343 --> 38:48.720
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!

39:14.121 --> 39:15.705
There he is!

39:17.541 --> 39:19.459
Grab him! Careful!

39:37.853 --> 39:40.063
What's going on?

39:41.899 --> 39:43.775
What have I told you?

39:43.901 --> 39:46.277
And you, eh?

39:46.403 --> 39:49.113
What the fuck are you doing
down here?

39:52.493 --> 39:55.036
Whose is this?

39:56.121 --> 39:57.997
It's mine.

40:02.252 --> 40:05.296
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.

40:10.094 --> 40:11.552
Get out!

40:14.848 --> 40:16.599
Out!

40:24.650 --> 40:29.153
Say a word about this
and I'll cut you in half. Got that?

40:41.333 --> 40:42.792
There you go.

40:43.627 --> 40:45.795
Our Carlos has been here
five minutes,

40:45.921 --> 40:48.214
and already he's in trouble.

40:49.133 --> 40:51.551
Have you read any more
of Monte Cristo?

40:52.177 --> 40:54.762
Do you believe in ghosts?

40:55.722 --> 40:57.765
There aren't any in the novel.

41:00.269 --> 41:03.020
I think I saw one, here.

41:05.190 --> 41:07.483
Carlos, as you can see,

41:08.527 --> 41:10.695
I'm a man of science.

41:10.821 --> 41:13.948
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.

41:14.992 --> 41:17.994
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.913
And that, in turn,
makes us see things.

41:21.039 --> 41:22.456
In town...

41:23.458 --> 41:25.168
...they call this...

41:27.045 --> 41:28.838
"the Devil's Backbone. "

41:28.964 --> 41:30.423
They say a lot of things.

41:30.549 --> 41:33.467
That this happens to children
who shouldn't have been born.

41:33.594 --> 41:36.512
"Nobody's children. " But that's a lie.

41:36.638 --> 41:39.599
Poverty and disease. That's all it is.

41:41.727 --> 41:44.729
The liquid they're in
is called "limbo water".

41:44.855 --> 41:50.401
In the old days, it was made
with various spices, cloves, rum.

41:51.236 --> 41:55.031
So this is very, very old rum.

41:55.157 --> 41:59.452
I sell it in town, and the money
keeps the school going.

41:59.578 --> 42:01.037
Do they drink it?

42:01.163 --> 42:06.125
They say it helps to cure blindness,
kidney ailments,

42:06.251 --> 42:10.171
and also, apparently... impotence.

42:10.297 --> 42:15.927
Rubbish, but you know, after 60,
men will pay anything just to...

42:16.053 --> 42:17.637
You know.

42:17.763 --> 42:22.099
So if you're going to believe
in ghosts and all that rubbish,

42:22.226 --> 42:26.437
you should have a sip of this
to heal your wound.

42:26.563 --> 42:30.566
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?

42:31.276 --> 42:33.110
Yes, of course.

42:34.613 --> 42:36.739
And be more careful!

43:07.396 --> 43:09.063
Calm down.

43:09.189 --> 43:11.190
I'm not going to hit you.

43:11.817 --> 43:13.818
So don't make any noise.

43:15.237 --> 43:19.156
Carlos, get out your comics
so we can look at them.

43:29.668 --> 43:31.919
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.

43:32.045 --> 43:35.965
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.

43:36.091 --> 43:38.509
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.

43:39.970 --> 43:41.470
Look.

43:42.556 --> 43:45.224
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.

43:45.350 --> 43:48.853
She's a looker! Who drew this?

43:49.438 --> 43:51.605
Her pussy's the wrong way round.

43:51.732 --> 43:55.609
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you lot know?

43:57.446 --> 43:59.280
Look, a slice of fig cake.

43:59.406 --> 44:02.199
It's a bit squashed
but it tastes good.

44:02.326 --> 44:05.870
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.

44:06.872 --> 44:08.581
All right.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.917
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.

44:14.796 --> 44:16.505
You're a real artist.

44:16.631 --> 44:18.466
When I grow up, I want to draw comics.

44:18.592 --> 44:21.719
- Like mine?
- No, much better.

44:21.845 --> 44:24.055
With more fights, more treasures.

44:24.181 --> 44:26.140
And big ships
with lots of cannons.

44:26.266 --> 44:29.977
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?

44:31.521 --> 44:33.981
Did you hear that?

44:34.107 --> 44:35.941
A sigh.

44:36.443 --> 44:38.027
I didn't hear it.

44:38.153 --> 44:40.529
I heard it too.

45:08.266 --> 45:10.184
Don't kiss me.

45:13.814 --> 45:15.981
Right, I forgot.

45:20.779 --> 45:23.030
This is the last time.

45:24.074 --> 45:26.242
"This is the last time. "

45:26.368 --> 45:28.369
Same old story.

45:41.049 --> 45:43.259
Don't make any noise.

45:44.219 --> 45:48.222
- Scared the old man will hear?
- I've never been scared.

45:50.142 --> 45:52.476
I'm ashamed.

45:54.312 --> 45:56.439
Right...

45:57.232 --> 46:00.484
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.

46:01.069 --> 46:02.945
He's a gentleman.

46:04.531 --> 46:07.158
What a pity that isn't enough.

46:12.038 --> 46:14.498
You need a hard cock as well.

46:15.041 --> 46:17.293
And your husband and the doctor...

46:18.211 --> 46:20.254
Tough luck.

46:28.430 --> 46:30.347
The old man looks at you
with love.

46:30.474 --> 46:33.642
He did that even when
your husband was alive.

46:33.768 --> 46:35.394
I was 17.

46:35.520 --> 46:38.731
By then, they took care
of the poetry,

46:38.857 --> 46:41.066
and I of the flesh.

46:45.155 --> 46:46.655
This leg...

46:49.201 --> 46:51.702
I don't like to think
about this leg.

46:53.413 --> 46:55.289
It hurts.

46:56.958 --> 46:59.043
Some days I can't bear it.

47:01.463 --> 47:04.215
But I need it to stay on my feet.

47:46.132 --> 47:49.009
I saw those lights again today
in the sky.

47:49.135 --> 47:51.178
That's the war. It'll never end.

47:51.304 --> 47:53.138
The war's shit.

47:53.265 --> 47:55.266
Well, I like it.

47:55.392 --> 47:56.976
You like it, dickhead?

47:57.102 --> 48:00.145
Yeah, because you see
the planes doing this.

48:01.690 --> 48:06.735
My mother says that the earth's
so dry here and the air's so hot,

48:06.861 --> 48:09.905
that the dead get stuck
halfway to heaven.

48:10.031 --> 48:13.450
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs".

48:15.287 --> 48:17.871
Not that again, you little shit!

48:23.420 --> 48:26.088
Even if it annoys him,
there's a ghost.

48:26.214 --> 48:29.758
The day the bomb fell,
a boy disappeared. Santi.

48:29.884 --> 48:32.595
Since then, no one has dared
to take Jaime on.

48:32.721 --> 48:34.888
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.

48:35.015 --> 48:37.224
Shit, I'm telling the story.

48:38.143 --> 48:40.811
The teachers think that
when the bomb fell,

48:40.937 --> 48:43.564
Santi got scared and ran away,

48:43.690 --> 48:46.817
and maybe some shepherds
found him and he's alive.

48:46.943 --> 48:49.612
Or a cutthroat got him
and took his blood.

48:49.738 --> 48:50.904
Yeah.

48:51.031 --> 48:54.908
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.

48:55.035 --> 48:57.119
And where's the ghost?

48:57.245 --> 48:58.912
It came with the bomb.

48:59.039 --> 49:01.498
Maybe if you ask it...

49:31.738 --> 49:33.447
Take that one.

49:39.913 --> 49:41.914
Out of the way.

49:51.091 --> 49:53.634
Put those in, but be careful!

49:54.469 --> 49:56.428
Don't break them.

50:31.923 --> 50:33.632
Miss.

50:36.261 --> 50:38.220
Look, I found this.

50:39.013 --> 50:41.265
I thought you'd like it.

50:43.435 --> 50:45.436
Open the gate, Jaime.

50:46.563 --> 50:48.272
It's lovely.

50:51.568 --> 50:53.777
It may look like gold, but it isn't.

50:53.903 --> 50:56.989
Well, for me, it is.

50:58.491 --> 51:00.492
It's beautiful.

51:00.618 --> 51:02.119
Thank you.

51:13.423 --> 51:14.840
What's that?

51:15.884 --> 51:17.760
Kids' stuff.

51:36.571 --> 51:40.991
Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?

51:42.827 --> 51:44.578
- Galvez?
- A pig.

51:46.289 --> 51:48.248
Well, a boar.

51:49.334 --> 51:51.168
Why not a giraffe?

51:51.920 --> 51:54.379
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.

51:54.506 --> 51:58.217
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.

51:58.343 --> 52:00.135
Very good.

52:02.222 --> 52:04.348
Your tutor taught you that.

52:04.474 --> 52:06.809
In those days,
men had to act in groups.

52:07.685 --> 52:10.270
No one could give up.

52:11.689 --> 52:14.566
Imagine the death of a mammoth.

52:14.692 --> 52:16.360
It must have been terrible.

52:16.486 --> 52:19.196
A mammoth steak, great!

52:22.492 --> 52:24.493
When you get to draw your comics,

52:24.619 --> 52:27.913
I could help you write the stories.

52:30.124 --> 52:31.750
I don't need anyone.

52:31.876 --> 52:34.586
My stories and my drawings
are mine, got that?

52:35.630 --> 52:39.591
Tomorrow, we'll continue
with the second part of prehistory.

52:40.510 --> 52:43.762
Leave your things in the dormitory.

52:46.266 --> 52:48.559
Then it's recess.

54:11.768 --> 54:13.435
Santi...

54:19.025 --> 54:21.234
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.

54:22.111 --> 54:24.446
Here you go.

54:24.572 --> 54:26.615
There isn't much.

54:26.741 --> 54:29.868
Hey, you! Bastards!

54:31.162 --> 54:32.746
What's going on?

54:32.872 --> 54:34.498
International Brigade.

54:34.624 --> 54:37.793
Two Spaniards,
six Canadians, one Chinaman.

54:37.919 --> 54:40.963
What the fuck's a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?

55:14.664 --> 55:18.125
You, look at your damn feet!
Against the wall!

55:34.726 --> 55:36.643
A friend of yours, Doc?

55:45.236 --> 55:49.197
Bomb, if you're alive,

55:49.323 --> 55:51.658
tell me where Santi is.

56:21.355 --> 56:23.148
Santi.

56:26.110 --> 56:27.944
Talk to me.

56:29.864 --> 56:32.199
I don't want anyone to die.

56:38.164 --> 56:41.500
Many of you will die.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.337
Please.

59:58.489 --> 01:00:00.490
A grain of strength...

01:00:08.749 --> 01:00:11.418
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.

01:00:11.544 --> 01:00:14.629
I need to talk to you,
but I don't want the boys to hear.

01:00:14.755 --> 01:00:17.674
Things are very bad out there.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.260
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.225
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.

01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:29.436
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?

01:00:29.562 --> 01:00:32.480
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.

01:00:32.606 --> 01:00:34.024
Go where?

01:00:35.609 --> 01:00:38.278
To Marseille, with the Ricards.

01:00:38.404 --> 01:00:41.698
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!

01:00:41.824 --> 01:00:45.744
Very well, we'll take them,
as many as we can.

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.122
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.

01:00:49.248 --> 01:00:52.000
Fuck the cause, Carmen,
fuck the cause!

01:00:52.126 --> 01:00:54.544
I always thought
there'd be an afterwards.

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:57.213
There is no afterwards!

01:01:00.343 --> 01:01:04.137
Carmen,
if anything happened to you...

01:01:04.263 --> 01:01:06.014
Doctor.

01:01:06.807 --> 01:01:10.310
The boys are waiting
for your permission to have breakfast.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.281
I'll need some papers.

01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:25.825
But we'll go.

01:01:31.874 --> 01:01:34.626
Boys, you may start.

01:01:34.752 --> 01:01:39.130
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.

01:01:39.256 --> 01:01:42.467
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.

01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:45.929
She's coming for me soon.

01:01:46.639 --> 01:01:48.890
Last night I saw the "one who sighs".

01:01:49.016 --> 01:01:50.809
Last night?

01:01:50.935 --> 01:01:53.228
You're making it up.

01:01:56.065 --> 01:01:58.650
It's Santi. I'm sure.

01:02:12.456 --> 01:02:14.624
Are you leaving?

01:02:15.584 --> 01:02:17.585
Where are you going?

01:02:21.966 --> 01:02:23.675
What about me?

01:02:26.429 --> 01:02:28.721
Fuck me, right?

01:02:37.481 --> 01:02:39.482
That's good.

01:02:39.608 --> 01:02:43.403
I want you to finish breakfast,
but while you're doing so,

01:02:43.988 --> 01:02:47.740
listen very carefully
because I have to tell you something.

01:02:47.867 --> 01:02:50.869
You may go,
but the gold stays here.

01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:53.455
The gold?

01:02:54.248 --> 01:02:57.417
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.

01:03:00.504 --> 01:03:02.130
What are you doing?

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.431
I hid you here so you wouldn't die
outside with no one to mourn you.

01:03:11.557 --> 01:03:13.183
Give me the key.

01:03:14.685 --> 01:03:16.686
You know what?

01:03:16.812 --> 01:03:20.023
Of all the orphans,
you were always the saddest.

01:03:20.149 --> 01:03:23.693
The lost one.
A prince without a kingdom.

01:03:23.819 --> 01:03:25.361
Shut up!

01:03:25.488 --> 01:03:28.239
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!

01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:31.159
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you!

01:03:34.997 --> 01:03:38.249
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.295
Will this weapon work?

01:03:44.215 --> 01:03:48.468
You know that while you whisper
sweet things to this old hag,

01:03:48.594 --> 01:03:51.054
I'm the one who has to screw her?

01:04:00.231 --> 01:04:03.066
And now... get out.

01:04:46.902 --> 01:04:49.279
What did you see?

01:04:49.405 --> 01:04:51.322
You know already.

01:04:51.448 --> 01:04:53.992
I don't know anything. Tell me.

01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:58.496
Santi.

01:04:58.622 --> 01:05:00.999
Santi's the "one who sighs".

01:05:03.168 --> 01:05:05.336
He's dead, isn't he?

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:20.518
Come on, boys.

01:05:20.644 --> 01:05:22.061
Conchita...

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:25.773
Would you bring me
a few cans of gas for the journey?

01:06:38.347 --> 01:06:40.139
Please, no!

01:06:56.198 --> 01:06:59.033
You'll all travel in the back
of the truck.

01:07:00.035 --> 01:07:02.161
It'll be a long journey.

01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:05.164
The older boys will have
to look after the little ones.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:08.626
If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.

01:07:16.552 --> 01:07:18.636
What are you doing?

01:07:51.253 --> 01:07:53.755
Are you all right, madam?

01:07:53.881 --> 01:07:55.882
It's my bad leg.

01:07:56.884 --> 01:07:58.885
It's heavier than ever.

01:08:09.146 --> 01:08:12.356
Did you think someone
would just give us a farm?

01:08:13.942 --> 01:08:15.943
What are you doing with that?

01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:21.365
You're crazy. They're all inside.

01:08:23.035 --> 01:08:25.118
Are you going to shoot me?

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.085
Please...

01:09:07.912 --> 01:09:09.497
- What was that?
- The children!

01:09:09.622 --> 01:09:12.416
Get them out! It's going to blow up!

01:09:15.504 --> 01:09:18.381
Get out! Outside!

01:09:31.937 --> 01:09:33.520
Carmen?

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.193
Alma, leave it be, come on!

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.825
Get out! All of you!

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.941
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.

01:12:24.067 --> 01:12:26.318
Don't move, don't look.

01:12:26.445 --> 01:12:28.279
Is it bad?

01:12:52.054 --> 01:12:54.930
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!

01:13:15.452 --> 01:13:17.828
They won't have heard
the explosion in town.

01:13:17.954 --> 01:13:21.957
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.

01:13:23.627 --> 01:13:26.670
If I walk all night,
I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.

01:13:40.102 --> 01:13:41.769
I've...

01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:44.396
I've got something to tell you.

01:13:45.023 --> 01:13:48.442
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.

01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:50.569
I couldn't...

01:13:50.695 --> 01:13:53.614
I can't hear you.
So, please...

01:13:54.533 --> 01:13:58.577
This time... let me do the talking.

01:14:00.872 --> 01:14:03.666
- I've learned a new poem.
- Yes.

01:14:04.334 --> 01:14:06.502
A poem.

01:14:09.047 --> 01:14:12.133
"Stay by my side
as my light grows dim,

01:14:12.259 --> 01:14:14.593
"as my blood slows down,

01:14:15.554 --> 01:14:18.597
"and my nerves shatter
with stabbing pain,

01:14:19.766 --> 01:14:22.101
"as my heart grows weak,

01:14:22.853 --> 01:14:25.688
"and the wheels of my being
turn slowly.

01:14:27.566 --> 01:14:29.650
"Stay by my side

01:14:29.776 --> 01:14:32.862
"as my fragile body is racked by pain,

01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:36.031
"which verges on truth...

01:14:37.909 --> 01:14:40.077
"and manic time,

01:14:40.203 --> 01:14:43.080
"continues scattering dust,

01:14:43.206 --> 01:14:46.333
"and furious life bursts out in flames.

01:14:48.587 --> 01:14:50.129
"Stay by my side

01:14:51.173 --> 01:14:52.923
"as I fade...

01:14:54.176 --> 01:14:57.469
"so you can point
to the end of my struggle...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.434
"and the twilight...

01:15:06.313 --> 01:15:08.105
"of eternal days...

01:15:12.068 --> 01:15:15.404
"at the low, dark edge of life. "

01:15:24.748 --> 01:15:26.248
Miss!

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.133
A grain of strength.

01:16:07.874 --> 01:16:09.416
Carlos, look.

01:16:14.422 --> 01:16:16.298
Dr Casares.

01:16:34.526 --> 01:16:36.568
That son of a bitch.

01:16:43.201 --> 01:16:45.869
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

01:16:45.996 --> 01:16:47.830
But he'll be back.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.874
And I'll be here...

01:16:51.668 --> 01:16:53.627
...waiting for him.

01:16:55.672 --> 01:16:57.089
Carlitos...

01:16:58.341 --> 01:17:03.012
Bring me my records, my music.

01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:07.099
I need them. All right?

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:44.762
Are you hungry?

01:17:44.888 --> 01:17:47.473
"Eat beans, good for the heart.

01:17:47.599 --> 01:17:49.600
"The more you eat,
the more you fart. "

01:17:52.103 --> 01:17:54.188
My stomach's all upset.

01:17:54.314 --> 01:17:57.066
But the little ones might be hungry.

01:18:03.615 --> 01:18:05.657
Could you kill someone?

01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:10.621
I could.

01:18:10.747 --> 01:18:14.375
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.

01:18:15.752 --> 01:18:18.379
But I didn't kill him.

01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:20.631
- I thought...
- I was with him.

01:18:22.801 --> 01:18:25.052
I saw everything.

01:18:25.887 --> 01:18:28.389
It started in the pit.

01:18:28.515 --> 01:18:33.268
I dared him to come down with me
at night to gather slugs.

01:19:16.104 --> 01:19:18.147
Run, Jaime. Jacinto's here.

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.291
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

01:19:37.417 --> 01:19:39.293
- Did you see the safe?
- No.

01:19:45.425 --> 01:19:47.050
Did you see the safe?

01:19:50.346 --> 01:19:52.639
Why the fuck are you in here?

01:19:54.184 --> 01:19:55.726
Who was with you?

01:20:11.451 --> 01:20:16.371
Get up.

01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:13.799
<i>I was a coward.</i>

01:23:15.093 --> 01:23:17.844
<i>I was always afraid of Jacinto.</i>

01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:21.306
<i>Very afraid.</i>

01:23:22.016 --> 01:23:24.017
But not anymore.

01:23:27.105 --> 01:23:29.106
The next time I see him...

01:23:29.732 --> 01:23:31.692
I know I'm going to kill him.

01:24:06.185 --> 01:24:08.186
Look who's here.

01:24:11.733 --> 01:24:14.151
Let's see how he handles her.

01:24:22.994 --> 01:24:24.995
Say you're sorry and get in the car.

01:24:27.665 --> 01:24:29.750
I'm not scared of you.

01:24:29.876 --> 01:24:32.836
You're making me look like a fool.

01:24:32.962 --> 01:24:36.089
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at us.

01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:41.052
I'm not afraid of you.

01:24:51.147 --> 01:24:53.064
Say you're sorry.

01:24:58.821 --> 01:25:00.781
You're an animal.

01:25:57.004 --> 01:25:59.881
Doctor, I did what you told me.

01:26:00.007 --> 01:26:04.427
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.

01:26:06.556 --> 01:26:08.056
Conchita.

01:26:11.602 --> 01:26:13.687
Someone's coming.

01:26:16.107 --> 01:26:17.983
Someone's coming, Doctor!

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:21.069
Help me on my feet.

01:26:21.195 --> 01:26:23.196
Jaime, put on the record.

01:26:23.948 --> 01:26:26.783
Turn the horn towards the window.

01:26:51.392 --> 01:26:53.685
Didn't you say he was dead?

01:26:55.021 --> 01:26:56.313
Bastard!

01:26:58.733 --> 01:27:01.943
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.

01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:17.208
They're leaving.

01:27:30.181 --> 01:27:35.268
All my life I've always stopped short,
left things unfinished.

01:27:37.063 --> 01:27:40.398
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.

01:27:43.277 --> 01:27:46.237
I will never leave this place.

01:28:14.141 --> 01:28:16.309
We'll wait for you upstairs.

01:28:35.705 --> 01:28:37.747
I'm not going to run away.

01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:41.459
I want to talk to you.

01:28:52.263 --> 01:28:53.805
Nothing.

01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:56.099
They must have driven on.

01:29:21.917 --> 01:29:24.878
Tell me, what do you want?

01:29:25.379 --> 01:29:27.422
Jacinto.

01:29:31.635 --> 01:29:34.596
Bring him to me.

01:29:35.598 --> 01:29:37.515
I understand.

01:29:40.352 --> 01:29:42.520
I'm going to help you.

01:29:44.315 --> 01:29:47.734
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.878
I had to break
the old man's fingers.

01:30:08.339 --> 01:30:10.965
Even dead, he's stubborn.

01:30:17.098 --> 01:30:19.140
Hurry up! Come on!

01:30:26.982 --> 01:30:28.733
There's something here!

01:30:28.859 --> 01:30:31.152
Marcelo! Out of the way!

01:30:37.493 --> 01:30:41.246
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.

01:30:51.382 --> 01:30:53.424
This is yours, isn't it?

01:31:38.762 --> 01:31:40.889
We have to get out of here.

01:31:47.021 --> 01:31:50.106
One of us has to climb
through the window.

01:31:53.068 --> 01:31:54.819
And then open the door.

01:31:54.945 --> 01:31:57.197
And what then?

01:31:57.323 --> 01:32:00.909
What's wrong? You scared?

01:32:01.035 --> 01:32:04.829
Yes, I am, arsehole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.

01:32:05.372 --> 01:32:08.374
You're not bleeding.
You're not even hurt.

01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:11.377
Santi is dead.

01:32:11.503 --> 01:32:13.421
Jacinto killed him.

01:32:14.715 --> 01:32:17.050
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:22.013
Do you want to sit and wait?

01:32:22.139 --> 01:32:24.515
You think he'll let us go?

01:32:25.684 --> 01:32:28.436
That it'll all work out if we behave?

01:32:30.814 --> 01:32:35.360
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.

01:32:42.284 --> 01:32:44.911
Yes, but there's more of us.

01:33:02.429 --> 01:33:03.972
Wait!

01:33:13.565 --> 01:33:16.526
Wait.
Check if they're still working.

01:33:25.577 --> 01:33:28.579
- Go on.
- All right.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.388
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?

01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:49.475
A bit.

01:34:04.116 --> 01:34:06.993
Fuck! Look again!

01:34:08.203 --> 01:34:11.831
There's nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!

01:34:14.543 --> 01:34:17.086
One of us has to go out
and get Galvez.

01:34:17.963 --> 01:34:20.423
- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.

01:34:20.549 --> 01:34:24.177
No, not you. I'll go. I'm skinnier.

01:34:43.113 --> 01:34:45.114
Who opened it?

01:35:01.006 --> 01:35:03.341
Dr Casares opened the door.

01:35:06.345 --> 01:35:09.972
He said I'd be all right,
and that we should be brave.

01:35:20.359 --> 01:35:23.778
There's no fucking gold here.
You hear me?

01:35:24.488 --> 01:35:27.740
You and your fancy ideas. Fuck!

01:35:30.285 --> 01:35:32.120
Gold, gold... My arse!

01:35:39.711 --> 01:35:41.587
My father.

01:35:41.713 --> 01:35:43.714
He was from Calanda.

01:35:45.134 --> 01:35:47.552
He was an accountant.
Quite elegant. Look.

01:35:51.098 --> 01:35:52.974
My mother was from Toledo.

01:35:54.601 --> 01:35:56.769
And that's me.

01:35:56.895 --> 01:35:59.230
It's blurred because I moved.

01:36:00.232 --> 01:36:01.774
But that's me.

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:04.026
We're leaving tomorrow.

01:36:04.153 --> 01:36:09.407
Pig, do you think your brother
in Portugal could put us up?

01:36:09.533 --> 01:36:11.659
We don't have much time.

01:36:16.748 --> 01:36:20.460
"How lonely,
the prince without a kingdom,

01:36:20.586 --> 01:36:23.045
"the man without warmth.

01:36:23.172 --> 01:36:26.048
"Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga. "

01:36:35.726 --> 01:36:37.852
I saw that gold.

01:36:37.978 --> 01:36:39.562
It's here.

01:36:39.688 --> 01:36:41.689
We just have to look for it.

01:36:46.153 --> 01:36:48.779
We'll find it,
and tomorrow we'll burn everything.

01:36:48.906 --> 01:36:52.116
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.

01:36:52.242 --> 01:36:55.203
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?

01:36:57.873 --> 01:36:59.707
We're at war.

01:37:00.751 --> 01:37:03.503
A drop in the ocean.

01:37:07.049 --> 01:37:08.382
Look, Jacinto.

01:37:08.509 --> 01:37:11.302
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.

01:37:11.845 --> 01:37:14.722
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.

01:37:32.658 --> 01:37:35.409
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.

01:37:36.537 --> 01:37:38.329
I'll need a hand.

01:37:40.374 --> 01:37:42.208
Come on, Pig.

01:38:29.298 --> 01:38:31.090
You're crazy, arsehole!

01:38:31.842 --> 01:38:33.801
Fuck you!

01:38:35.429 --> 01:38:38.139
No, fuck you! It's all for me.

01:39:08.795 --> 01:39:10.838
Son of a bitch!

01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:09.105
What a joke!

01:40:24.705 --> 01:40:26.706
Galvez, you go over there.

01:40:37.676 --> 01:40:40.010
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!

01:40:59.322 --> 01:41:00.865
Santi...

01:42:44.469 --> 01:42:46.804
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:50.933
<i>A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?</i>

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:55.896
<i>A moment of pain, perhaps.</i>

01:43:02.779 --> 01:43:06.448
<i>Something dead
which still seems to be alive.</i>

01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:13.581
<i>An emotion suspended in time.</i>

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.174
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

01:43:33.935 --> 01:43:36.770
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

01:43:52.829 --> 01:43:54.455
<i>A ghost.</i>

01:43:55.332 --> 01:43:57.333
<i>That's what I am.</i>

01:44:05.759 --> 01:44:07.885
TO MY PARENTS
