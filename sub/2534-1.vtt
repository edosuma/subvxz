00:39.447 --> 00:42.022
Fat Dog, you've finally appeared

00:42.022 --> 00:44.628
If I don't catch you today, I can't report back to base

00:55.004 --> 00:58.186
After being in the force for this long,
have I ever arrested the wrong person?

00:58.186 --> 01:01.241
I'll leave that question for the judge

01:01.241 --> 01:04.421
My philosophy is that ...

01:05.236 --> 01:06.996
Cops catch felons

01:53.955 --> 01:57.779
Before the 1997 Handover

02:13.412 --> 02:14.140
4 fives

02:14.140 --> 02:15.105
Open

02:15.105 --> 02:17.487
Drink!
-This time doesn't count

02:17.487 --> 02:20.032
Come, again ... this bottle

02:20.264 --> 02:21.122
7 sixes

02:21.122 --> 02:22.592
You lost again
- Do you know how to play?

02:22.592 --> 02:24.231
Waiter, give her the rule book

02:51.759 --> 02:53.267
Let me introduce you.  My younger brother, 'Tiger'

02:53.267 --> 02:54.488
Brother Shan

02:54.925 --> 02:56.930
Hello, Brother Shan
- Hello

02:56.930 --> 02:58.912
You're sweating a lot

03:04.368 --> 03:06.716
That's my adopted brother .. Zha

03:12.577 --> 03:16.015
I have a lot of stuff to move.  There are many smugglers who can do it

03:16.015 --> 03:18.316
- You want to a contract deal
- If you want to do Vietnam ...

03:18.316 --> 03:20.580
If must be us 3 brothers

03:20.580 --> 03:23.652
Who would know the place better than us?
We are Vietnamese

03:23.652 --> 03:25.713
However you want to split it, we'll go along with it

03:25.713 --> 03:27.223
That's all there is to it

03:33.991 --> 03:35.617
I lost again

03:35.617 --> 03:37.975
It doesn't count.  Again, again

03:39.475 --> 03:41.677
4 ones, I don't care.
-4 ones?

03:41.677 --> 03:43.187
Is that right?

03:43.187 --> 03:45.347
Just because you don't think so

03:49.325 --> 03:51.345
Police checking ID.
Move in

03:53.059 --> 03:54.569
Check ID

03:57.072 --> 03:59.549
You.  Get out here

04:05.166 --> 04:08.832
I threw that bottle

04:09.914 --> 04:11.587
So what?

04:12.237 --> 04:14.492
My apologies

04:33.109 --> 04:36.892
Flashpoint

04:37.870 --> 04:39.395
1996, January 2nd

04:39.395 --> 04:43.501
Mongkok, [?] Stanley St, whilst checking ID,
you assaulted a person

04:43.501 --> 04:47.125
And broke the criminal's pelvis in 3 places

04:47.125 --> 04:48.763
He spent 2 months in hospital.
How do you plead?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.808
1997, February 17th

04:52.808 --> 04:56.759
Yaumatei, Miu St, Triad activity.
You assaulted another person

04:56.759 --> 04:59.165
The criminal sustained serious head injury

04:59.165 --> 05:02.128
According to the doctor, has permanently lost his sense of taste

05:02.128 --> 05:04.182
How do you plead?

05:05.268 --> 05:08.253
1996 ...
- That’s enough

05:08.253 --> 05:08.896
I'm guilty

05:08.896 --> 05:12.159
In the first half of this year,
on average you have been involved in 14 cases per month

05:12.159 --> 05:15.226
In each case, you have injured, on average, 2.8 people

05:15.728 --> 05:18.528
Half a year.  You have already broken your record from last year

05:18.528 --> 05:20.692
What's the problem with police apprehending criminals?

05:20.692 --> 05:22.464
The person making the complaint is me

05:22.464 --> 05:25.323
Are we here to arrest criminals, or police?

05:25.323 --> 05:28.943
Inspector Ma, I know that you are an outstanding officer

05:28.943 --> 05:31.533
You have the highest number of solved cases

05:31.533 --> 05:32.773
But I want to remind you ...

05:32.773 --> 05:36.084
You need to pay attention to your attitude and the way you operate

05:36.084 --> 05:37.787
I don't think there is a problem

05:38.637 --> 05:40.739
OK, you can leave

05:44.514 --> 05:45.889
I've timed it

05:45.889 --> 05:48.716
From when I came in, you've talked for 1 hour

05:48.716 --> 05:51.400
Who knows, perhaps in an hour, I could have solved a case

05:51.400 --> 05:54.079
Do you think you need to reconsider you operating standards

05:54.079 --> 05:56.386
Don't waste everyone's time

06:05.407 --> 06:06.973
Good

06:06.973 --> 06:09.566
That's $50k.  You want to bet with me?

06:09.566 --> 06:12.025
Betting so big with me, you'll lose everything

06:15.345 --> 06:18.742
Tiger ... that's not how you play golf

06:18.742 --> 06:21.307
It's not martial arts, where you use that stance

06:21.307 --> 06:22.423
Here, I'll teach you

06:22.423 --> 06:25.129
It’s simple.  You hold the club

06:25.129 --> 06:28.337
Most important is that your thigh and shoulder is level

06:28.337 --> 06:31.925
Look where you're aiming, then look at the ball

06:31.925 --> 06:34.104
Then swing through hard

06:39.045 --> 06:41.162
That's what you shouldn't do

06:45.924 --> 06:48.170
Again, again

06:48.318 --> 06:50.748
Brother Zha. something's not right

06:58.325 --> 07:00.142
Hold on

07:00.354 --> 07:02.479
These friends don't know anything

07:02.479 --> 07:04.533
You leave first

07:08.766 --> 07:10.664
I asked you to move the stuff to Vietnam.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.779
But if you're not blaming it on tornados, 
then it’s because of storms

07:12.779 --> 07:16.258
It’s been 2 months, friend.  You trying to send it to the moon?

07:16.258 --> 07:18.337
You screwing with me?
- Friend ...

07:18.337 --> 07:20.383
Big winds and big waves are inevitable

07:20.383 --> 07:22.528
How about you?

07:22.528 --> 07:24.372
The blame will be on you if the ship sinks

07:25.266 --> 07:28.416
The shipment was worth $80 Mil.  
[?] You've only paid back $2k

07:29.332 --> 07:31.762
You should have told me earlier, I would have sent it by courier

07:31.762 --> 07:33.299
It’s just a few days by plane

07:33.299 --> 07:35.604
If your shipping it by sea, of course it will take a few months

07:35.604 --> 07:37.426
Go home and wait

07:37.681 --> 07:38.918
What did you say?

07:41.623 --> 07:43.252
Don't be stupid now

07:43.252 --> 07:45.918
Otherwise, I'll kill you

07:46.480 --> 07:49.552
You trying to scare me?  Which one are you?

07:49.642 --> 07:52.481
Your boss won't come out, and leaves you flunkies here instead 

07:52.481 --> 07:54.475
Get Tony out here!

07:56.744 --> 07:57.796
Mother fucker

08:16.528 --> 08:18.992
This is how we work

08:33.267 --> 08:36.383
Don't do that in public

08:37.928 --> 08:39.381
Put on some suntan lotion

08:43.181 --> 08:45.661
Don't be like that.  Is this revenge?

08:45.661 --> 08:49.264
Wait for me.  You two are always bickering

08:49.940 --> 08:50.855
Tan

08:50.855 --> 08:52.607
Don't let him play cool all the time

08:52.607 --> 08:54.089
If you're going to arrest someone, then just arrest them

08:54.089 --> 08:57.153
You're always bashing people up.  Yeah, we know you can fight

08:57.897 --> 09:01.601
Every time something happens you come looking for me.
Each time you come looking for me, you want me to save you

09:01.601 --> 09:04.087
And if something bad happens, you put it on me.
What do you want me to do?

09:04.087 --> 09:05.669
What are you still complaining about, muscle man?

09:05.669 --> 09:07.135
Taking off your clothes all day, showing your arse

09:07.135 --> 09:10.643
Last time you injured my arm, the doctor said that there would be complications

09:10.882 --> 09:12.962
You threw a whole bottle of wine in my face

09:12.962 --> 09:15.007
If I didn't do something, everyone would be suspicious

09:15.007 --> 09:16.482
You fought back, remember

09:16.482 --> 09:18.965
You hit me, of course I would retaliate.
You want me to lose my street cred?

09:18.965 --> 09:20.599
Street cred?! You're a cop! Street cred.

09:20.599 --> 09:22.742
Why don't you scream it out louder, idiot

09:22.742 --> 09:26.036
We're all on the same side here, you shouldn't have been so heavy handed

09:26.036 --> 09:28.365
And you.  You know that he is a loose cannon, and you still go light a fire under him

09:28.365 --> 09:29.668
Who else would do that?

09:29.668 --> 09:31.628
When you got me into this, you made it sound good

09:31.628 --> 09:33.593
[?]

09:33.593 --> 09:35.892
- How long do I need to stay undercover?

09:35.892 --> 09:38.772
Don't talk about the past.  Let's talk about the facts

09:38.772 --> 09:40.700
Who is your superior here?

09:40.700 --> 09:41.970
Oh, this again

09:41.970 --> 09:44.420
What? There's such thing as a chain of command

09:44.420 --> 09:47.500
Stop arguing.  The two of you will probably never work together again anyway

09:47.711 --> 09:49.192
Really?

09:49.300 --> 09:50.735
The Complaints department report is out

09:50.735 --> 09:53.303
You remain team leader, but next month you report to the music department

09:53.303 --> 09:55.401
No need to be that harsh

09:55.401 --> 09:57.853
You said it yourself.  There's a chain of command

09:58.503 --> 09:59.969
I want to appeal

10:10.414 --> 10:12.326
Keep at it.  It's up to you now

10:12.326 --> 10:14.679
Same to you

10:14.807 --> 10:17.867
Try not to be so picky.  Do whatever you want to do

10:18.243 --> 10:19.675
If I die, then I die

10:19.675 --> 10:22.524
I've lived my fill

10:59.568 --> 11:01.139
What sort of playing is that?

11:01.139 --> 11:02.740
Wrong four times out of four

11:02.740 --> 11:04.172
When was I wrong?

11:04.172 --> 11:06.651
12th section, after the 6th note, the E sharp

11:06.651 --> 11:09.745
We didn't hear anything wrong, except for your shouting

11:10.244 --> 11:12.033
As officers, we should take things seriously

11:12.033 --> 11:14.707
You think we are mucking around?  If you want to do that, leave

11:14.707 --> 11:16.846
Not everyone does things your way, Inspector Ma

11:16.846 --> 11:19.241
You ..
- You must have been wrong

11:19.241 --> 11:20.955
If an officer makes a mistake

11:20.955 --> 11:24.462
They will ruin someone else’s life, or their own

11:24.462 --> 11:27.212
Take it seriously, and improve your work

11:27.320 --> 11:28.585
What are you doing here, mum?

11:28.585 --> 11:31.467
I knew that you were here, and wanted to let you know ..

11:31.467 --> 11:33.362
I'm going back to the country

11:33.827 --> 11:35.684
Wait till I have a bit of free time, and I'll take you back

11:35.684 --> 11:37.940
I've already waited

11:37.940 --> 11:40.670
Waited until Auntie ChangZhou is dead

11:40.775 --> 11:42.788
I'll go back to pay my respects

11:42.788 --> 11:46.389
If I like it there, I won't come back

11:46.389 --> 11:47.573
Don't be like that, mum.

11:47.573 --> 11:50.186
I'm very lonely here by myself

11:50.186 --> 11:54.449
You worry all day, and have no time for me

11:55.214 --> 11:59.079
Take care.  You shouldn't risk so much going after crooks

11:59.079 --> 12:03.036
What's the most important thing?  It's preserving your own life

12:03.036 --> 12:05.976
Without your life, how can you be a person

12:07.383 --> 12:10.201
Take care.  I'm leaving now

12:38.286 --> 12:40.447
Everyone's just after a living

12:40.447 --> 12:42.267
You took Shan's stuff

12:42.267 --> 12:45.010
He called you out to negotiate, and you turn it to a fight

12:45.010 --> 12:48.713
And now you ask us to ignore it.  Why?

12:49.031 --> 12:50.917
Shan will disappear

12:50.917 --> 12:54.444
If in the end, it is found that you are involved, it won’t be good

12:54.444 --> 12:57.083
If you leave it alone, nothing will happen

12:57.285 --> 13:00.482
If it wasn't for the 3 of you, nothing would have happened

13:00.482 --> 13:02.893
Its better if you don't mess up our place

13:02.893 --> 13:05.141
If we didn't take you in ...

13:05.141 --> 13:07.566
You'd still be floating in the sea

13:09.556 --> 13:12.374
Our family was stuck in a refugee camp

13:12.374 --> 13:14.306
It wasn't much different to living in prison

13:14.306 --> 13:16.323
Why did we riot?

13:16.323 --> 13:19.022
Because we wanted a place of our own

13:19.987 --> 13:23.347
If there are those that don't want us around

13:23.347 --> 13:25.999
Then we go to war

13:34.706 --> 13:35.630
Boss

13:35.630 --> 13:37.822
How is it?  All done?

13:37.822 --> 13:39.233
No good?

13:39.233 --> 13:40.556
No yet

13:40.556 --> 13:42.992
It's not that the talks have broken down, but they haven't started yet

13:42.992 --> 13:46.789
Don't do anything for now, otherwise there'd  be nothing to discuss

13:47.996 --> 13:50.133
Don't be unreasonable now.

13:51.479 --> 13:53.609
That's it.  Just do it

13:53.609 --> 13:54.709
Wait ...

13:54.709 --> 13:57.209
You talk to them

13:59.503 --> 14:02.490
Four eyes, your wife takes your kid to school so early

14:02.490 --> 14:03.768
It'd be unfortunate if they died

14:03.768 --> 14:04.618
Are you threatening me?

14:04.618 --> 14:07.896
Of course I'm threatening you, otherwise I wouldn't be shouting you breakfast [??]

14:09.267 --> 14:11.236
I also don't want to hurt everyone’s feelings

14:11.236 --> 14:15.456
If we can work this one out, 
there will be a lot more opportunities for us in the future

14:19.488 --> 14:21.701
The four eyed woman in red ...

14:21.701 --> 14:25.230
taking her dopey four eyed kid

14:25.337 --> 14:28.806
When I tell you to run over them, I want you to floor the gas

14:28.806 --> 14:30.087
OK

14:31.030 --> 14:33.244
Quickly, have you thought it over?

14:33.386 --> 14:36.817
Your 4 eyed kid is about to reach the entrance

14:39.827 --> 14:42.780
I can't hear anyone answering me

14:46.027 --> 14:47.860
We will ignore the situation with Shan

14:47.860 --> 14:50.913
That's too quiet, he won't be able to hear you

14:55.982 --> 14:57.801
We will ignore the situation with Shan

14:58.532 --> 15:01.519
Don't be careless now, y'hear

15:03.301 --> 15:06.036
Zha, this is Da Xia

15:06.036 --> 15:09.274
Let's go out for drinks when you're free, we're all friends here

15:09.274 --> 15:11.895
You should have said from the start

15:19.332 --> 15:20.814
Have breakfast

15:20.814 --> 15:24.408
I've spent the money to buy it ... are you not giving me any face?

15:26.955 --> 15:29.162
Run over them

15:29.498 --> 15:30.444
OK

15:35.876 --> 15:37.038
Turn

15:41.836 --> 15:43.806
Are you a dog?  So obedient

15:43.806 --> 15:46.294
Just because I said it, you'd do it?
You could have killed someone

15:46.294 --> 15:48.166
How can you be so dumb?

15:51.279 --> 15:53.978
Hey, it's my shout for your birthday tonight

15:54.793 --> 15:56.732
I going to meet some friends

15:56.732 --> 15:59.124
What? You have friends?

15:59.448 --> 16:01.180
Yes
-OK

16:03.325 --> 16:05.790
Here, have fun

16:05.790 --> 16:06.962
- Thank you, Boss

16:28.673 --> 16:30.513
Lily?

16:31.057 --> 16:34.353
It's me.  Are you free?  Come over

16:35.601 --> 16:37.366
What are you saying?

16:37.366 --> 16:38.992
Why are you shouting at me out of the sudden?

16:39.626 --> 16:42.574
Hi May, I'm looking for your daughter

16:42.820 --> 16:45.286
She's dead?

16:45.989 --> 16:47.402
I'm so sorry ...

16:47.402 --> 16:50.717
Bobby?  Its Wilson

16:50.717 --> 16:53.470
What's up?  It's my birthday today

16:54.863 --> 16:57.374
Don't talk about that stuff

16:57.374 --> 17:01.455
I won the lottery, I want to spend it up

17:01.455 --> 17:03.078
Hello? Hello?

17:05.402 --> 17:07.076
Hi, is Julie there

17:07.230 --> 17:09.329
Happy birthday

17:11.946 --> 17:13.633
Thank you

17:14.913 --> 17:16.598
Have you finished work?

17:16.598 --> 17:18.494
Not yet.  I'll come over after work

17:18.494 --> 17:20.470
OK, bye

17:20.470 --> 17:22.125
Bye

17:53.391 --> 17:55.486
It’s been a while

17:55.486 --> 17:59.443
It hasn't been that long.  We met half a year ago

18:00.424 --> 18:02.047
Have you been to Vietnam recently?

18:02.047 --> 18:04.245
If you're going, you should be careful

18:04.245 --> 18:06.418
You might get caught

18:07.244 --> 18:10.172
Even if I'm just going there for a bowl of noodles?

18:10.172 --> 18:13.155
I thought you wanted to stop selling alcohol,
Why are you still doing it?

18:14.178 --> 18:15.802
Do you think I like it?

18:15.802 --> 18:17.650
What else can I do?

18:17.650 --> 18:19.948
Unless ...

18:20.190 --> 18:21.943
You want me to be a prostitute?

18:24.257 --> 18:28.716
Don't say that.  Do something respectable

18:29.969 --> 18:32.086
You know that 'Blue Girl' (beer)

18:32.086 --> 18:35.014
[?] got popular because she sold herself

18:35.014 --> 18:36.914
How about Carlsberg?

18:37.789 --> 18:39.294
He was unfortunate

18:39.294 --> 18:41.703
He sold himself until he was an old man
before he got the brand

18:41.703 --> 18:44.778
Otherwise it wouldn't have been called 'Uncle Carls' (phonetic pun)

18:48.607 --> 18:49.872
How about mine?

18:50.414 --> 18:52.521
[?] Now, it’s wrong to say that threes no future in living large

18:52.521 --> 18:57.055
[?] It was only because he lived large, that he got the Johnnie Walker brand

18:58.706 --> 19:01.807
I'll let myself out later.  Let's have a shower

19:41.823 --> 19:44.119
Tiger, are we going to do this

19:44.395 --> 19:46.110
This is not for you

20:02.725 --> 20:04.037
Where so you want to go later?

20:04.037 --> 20:06.129
I want to go for a picnic
-OK

20:10.804 --> 20:12.677
Take our daughter away from here

20:37.149 --> 20:38.924
Cops!  Get in!

20:38.924 --> 20:40.042
You're lucky

21:00.683 --> 21:02.875
You can leave hospital at anytime

21:02.875 --> 21:04.770
If you keep fighting, I won't let it go so easily

21:04.770 --> 21:06.927
If you want to die, do it far away from me.
Don't keep involving me

21:06.927 --> 21:09.588
I want to turn state witness

21:21.847 --> 21:23.260
Come in

21:24.366 --> 21:26.467
Inspector Wong, we've bought the criminal

21:36.220 --> 21:37.760
That hurts, Inspector Wong

21:38.705 --> 21:41.015
Do you have something to drink?  It’s hot.

21:41.015 --> 21:43.495
Shan's spilled the beans about Tony

21:44.148 --> 21:46.428
That’s great, go arrest him then

21:46.428 --> 21:48.351
[?] We have to prepare

21:48.568 --> 21:50.945
Those guys are insane, if they wanted revenge, 
the first to die would be you

21:50.945 --> 21:53.559
I know, I'm more scared than you

21:54.100 --> 21:56.918
Inspector Wong, please don't tell me you're leading the team on this one

21:56.918 --> 21:59.254
Relax, I won’t be leading.  I'm not the one 
that has been keeping tabs on those Vietnamese kids

21:59.254 --> 22:01.295
Get them to call back that handsome and outstanding officer

22:01.295 --> 22:03.070
This is a time when the department needs him the most

22:03.070 --> 22:05.080
It's you who needs him the most

22:05.253 --> 22:06.022
Yes

22:09.977 --> 22:11.523
Inspector Wong

22:11.799 --> 22:13.136
Shut the door

22:13.326 --> 22:14.460
What are you doing?

22:14.460 --> 22:16.349
Do you want me to die, opening the door so wide

22:16.814 --> 22:20.092
This time just speak your mind if there is anything

22:20.092 --> 22:22.519
Fine, otherwise, why would we call you back?

22:22.519 --> 22:24.893
Help us out, solve this case, 
and we can all go swimming OK?

22:24.893 --> 22:26.086
Yes, Inspector Wong

22:26.086 --> 22:27.702
Here, put this on your head

22:28.843 --> 22:29.977
Put it on

22:29.977 --> 22:32.710
Let me finish my smoke
- Forget it, put it out

22:32.710 --> 22:34.077
You won't get any girls

22:34.077 --> 22:38.062
Put it on, you fuckwit

22:38.062 --> 22:40.304
Inspector Wong, he's not co-operating

22:40.304 --> 22:41.836
Take him out for a beating, then

22:41.836 --> 22:45.262
We're about to have the '97 Handover, 
can you guys take things a little more seriously?

22:46.081 --> 22:47.887
It’s their mother's big birthday tonight

22:47.887 --> 22:49.959
The 3 will definitely come out tonight

22:49.959 --> 22:52.310
First we take care of their associates

22:55.990 --> 22:59.958
Four eyes, we want to interview you back at the station about the Vietnamese case

23:02.637 --> 23:03.746
OK

23:04.085 --> 23:06.162
Brother Wilson

23:06.398 --> 23:07.876
Brother Wilson

23:08.469 --> 23:10.313
Eat, try a bit
-This way Sir

23:10.313 --> 23:12.862
It smells good, try it
- Auntie

23:13.482 --> 23:16.626
Wishing you fortunes deeper than the Eastern Sea,
happiness higher than the Southern mountains

23:16.626 --> 23:19.606
That you become prettier year by year,
and that you are forever youthful

23:19.606 --> 23:21.502
Thank you ..
- Thank you

23:21.502 --> 23:22.545
Auntie, is your appetite good today?

23:22.545 --> 23:26.051
Stop talking to her, she’s stopped eating

23:26.217 --> 23:27.452
OK
- Leave

23:27.452 --> 23:29.482
Auntie, enjoy your meal

23:29.749 --> 23:31.281
If they don't return the calls, then keep calling

23:31.281 --> 23:34.665
You don't need me to tell you that.  
What time is it already?  Nobody's here

23:34.665 --> 23:37.533
- Have a bite
- Mother fucker, go!

23:39.544 --> 23:41.702
Here, have a bit

23:43.488 --> 23:44.740
Tiger

23:45.020 --> 23:46.258
Come here

23:48.482 --> 23:50.659
You're so loud that mothers' not eating any more

23:50.659 --> 23:52.056
Kneel

23:53.350 --> 23:55.083
Apologize to mother

23:55.858 --> 23:58.894
Mother, please eat some

24:05.890 --> 24:07.894
Everyone's here

24:07.894 --> 24:13.049
If no one goes to see Zha,  
who will be there to celebrate their mother's birthday?

24:13.241 --> 24:15.102
Have a mouthful

24:15.102 --> 24:17.075
Eat

24:18.406 --> 24:21.021
If you don't want this, then what do you want?

24:30.254 --> 24:31.766
You don't like it?

24:31.766 --> 24:34.695
We'll order something else, OK?  Sea cucumber?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.865
Abalone?  You don't like it?

24:37.865 --> 24:40.213
Then I'll order Birds Nest Soup for you

24:40.509 --> 24:42.172
Sharks Fin?

24:42.291 --> 24:44.774
Big Brother, something's wrong

24:44.774 --> 24:47.981
What's more important than mother not eating?

24:50.214 --> 24:50.949
Eat

24:50.949 --> 24:53.209
Tiger, feed mother

24:53.497 --> 24:55.993
Time to work ...

24:56.432 --> 24:58.708
Stay here tonight

24:58.708 --> 25:00.416
Someone will take care of you

25:01.494 --> 25:03.914
You must catch them, Inspector Ma

25:08.216 --> 25:09.284
Here

25:12.719 --> 25:14.670
Have a mouthful

25:16.418 --> 25:18.655
The food here doesn't suit you

25:18.655 --> 25:20.085
I'll take you somewhere else, OK?

25:20.085 --> 25:21.510
- Tiger
-Where?

25:21.510 --> 25:22.732
Don't worry, let's go

25:22.732 --> 25:24.818
Wilson, come here

25:24.818 --> 25:26.092
Coming

25:26.315 --> 25:27.759
They're all waiting for you there
- Quickly

25:27.759 --> 25:28.573
OK

25:28.573 --> 25:30.549
Manager

25:35.017 --> 25:36.239
Did you drive today?

25:36.239 --> 25:39.151
Which car?  Where is it parked?

25:49.253 --> 25:50.252
Hello?

25:50.252 --> 25:52.066
Tony, go and get the money

25:52.066 --> 25:53.982
I'll leave with mother first.  We'll meet at the pier

25:53.982 --> 25:55.453
Understood

25:57.301 --> 25:58.660
Where to, Tony?

25:58.660 --> 25:59.949
To the garage

26:00.478 --> 26:02.799
Second brother, what’s happening?

26:09.788 --> 26:11.936
- Have you seen these people?
- What time was that at?

26:12.798 --> 26:13.956
- Inspector Ma
- What's the situation?

26:13.956 --> 26:15.647
There is someone injured, an ambulance is coming

26:19.637 --> 26:20.749
Xiao Ying

26:21.070 --> 26:22.235
- Check his vehicle rego
-Yes

26:22.235 --> 26:23.592
- Xiao Ya, tie up the loose ends here
-Yes

26:27.003 --> 26:27.870
Hello?

26:27.870 --> 26:31.092
Where are you? I'm at your front door

26:31.092 --> 26:33.585
I’m busy.  I'll call you back later

26:35.734 --> 26:38.014
I can wait here for you to come back

26:38.014 --> 26:39.829
Not tonight

26:39.829 --> 26:41.212
I've already made a spare key for you

26:41.212 --> 26:43.733
I'll give it to you next time

26:44.783 --> 26:46.795
Can you not talk on the phone

26:46.795 --> 26:48.170
Sorry

27:00.466 --> 27:03.524
Da Pao, the target vehicle is a dark green Mazda MPV

27:03.524 --> 27:05.796
Registration JL2933

27:05.796 --> 27:07.494
Also, a maroon Acrua

27:07.494 --> 27:09.583
Registration DE3654

27:48.817 --> 27:51.080
Help out

28:18.877 --> 28:21.208
Brother Tiger, did you lock the door?

28:21.323 --> 28:22.160
Oh yeah

28:22.160 --> 28:25.071
I'll do it, you get in the car first

28:37.694 --> 28:40.199
They're leaving with the money, call you later

28:57.192 --> 28:58.522
We can go now, Brother Tony

28:58.522 --> 29:00.820
- Have you locked it?
- I have

29:10.467 --> 29:12.121
Sit in the back

29:12.806 --> 29:14.242
OK

29:30.691 --> 29:32.834
That's the car

29:40.784 --> 29:44.673
Wilson, give me your phone

29:51.444 --> 29:52.932
Brother Tony

30:10.849 --> 30:13.477
Mother, sit tight

30:14.272 --> 30:15.960
Don't drive so fast

30:42.620 --> 30:44.471
Pull over

30:44.471 --> 30:45.950
I said, pull over

30:48.079 --> 30:49.561
Mother, sit tight

30:56.423 --> 30:58.134
Jia Hui, ChangAn direction

30:58.451 --> 31:00.342
Are you alright.  Hang in there

31:00.342 --> 31:03.104
- I want to vomit.
- Vomit in here

31:03.104 --> 31:05.052
You'll feel better after you bring it up

31:05.118 --> 31:07.137
It's alright

31:12.345 --> 31:13.971
We in the chemical factory district

31:50.895 --> 31:52.734
Get out

32:24.258 --> 32:27.120
We're going to the pier

33:13.609 --> 33:15.651
Have a look

33:22.161 --> 33:23.974
Hey, Sir

33:23.974 --> 33:25.092
Are you alright?

33:28.757 --> 33:30.178
- How's Wilson?
- Inspector Wong

33:30.178 --> 33:32.168
Don't know yet, they're working on him

33:32.339 --> 33:34.643
If he can be saved then it’s alright.  Stay calm

33:37.749 --> 33:38.730
Hey, what are you doing?

33:38.730 --> 33:40.434
I won't let you off

33:40.434 --> 33:41.096
What are you doing?

33:41.096 --> 33:42.531
What's it to you

33:42.818 --> 33:43.970
Are you Julie?

33:43.970 --> 33:45.401
Assaulting a police officer, I can charge you

33:45.401 --> 33:46.728
So what if you're a cop?

33:46.728 --> 33:48.729
Wilson is my partner

33:52.955 --> 33:55.030
He is also a cop

34:31.801 --> 34:34.141
What are you in for?  Triad activity?

34:34.393 --> 34:35.505
I'm not a Triad member

34:35.505 --> 34:37.920
No? Then follow me

34:38.895 --> 34:41.687
Call me Brother Zha

34:42.145 --> 34:43.681
Do it

34:43.851 --> 34:45.358
Brother Zha

34:46.989 --> 34:49.603
Have you ever seen your 3 son's beating up others?

34:49.603 --> 34:52.670
I have 3 sons?

34:54.367 --> 34:57.139
I've never seen it

34:57.492 --> 35:02.798
Sir, can you call the police for me?

35:04.230 --> 35:07.370
Sir, call the police for me

35:09.222 --> 35:13.109
My son is missing

35:17.191 --> 35:19.653
No one will come to see her on holidays

35:19.653 --> 35:22.367
Perhaps, never at any other time either

35:22.539 --> 35:25.966
Take care of her for me.  She tends to wander

35:33.279 --> 35:37.283
It's my birthday.  I'm 80.  You should have come earlier

35:37.283 --> 35:40.426
I'm 80 ..

35:43.383 --> 35:46.435
Xian Wei Zha, there is sufficient evidence to show

35:46.435 --> 35:49.344
That during the period from 1992 to Feb 1997

35:49.344 --> 35:53.373
you were involved in smuggling, aggravated assault, and Triad activities

35:53.373 --> 35:56.119
Those are the charges.  How do you plead?

35:56.637 --> 35:58.691
Not guilty

35:59.290 --> 36:01.344
Hearing is set for May this year

36:01.344 --> 36:03.707
Transfer the case to the North Kowloon courts

36:03.707 --> 36:07.096
Use this time to gather your reasons

36:07.096 --> 36:09.224
You are denied bail or permission to leave the country

36:09.224 --> 36:12.280
All your assets are now frozen

36:12.280 --> 36:13.696
Until sentence is passed

36:14.989 --> 36:16.000
You're putting it all on me

36:16.032 --> 36:17.985
You think you can convict me?

36:18.428 --> 36:19.182
Let's go

36:19.182 --> 36:21.781
Take your wandering hands off me 

36:22.152 --> 36:23.291
I'll sue you for sexual assault

36:23.291 --> 36:24.544
Let's go

36:27.794 --> 36:29.623
3 months later

36:37.654 --> 36:39.401
I won't be able to keep up with you soon

36:39.401 --> 36:41.434
Then I'll slow down to wait for you

36:41.434 --> 36:44.254
Take it slowly.  You'll get used to it

36:44.590 --> 36:46.150
Of course it will be slow

36:46.360 --> 36:49.177
I've lost the use on a leg,
you think I'll get used to that?

36:49.964 --> 36:52.221
Everything's sorted out for you

36:52.221 --> 36:55.953
Next week, you'll be changed to a desk job

36:56.078 --> 36:57.562
Desk job?

36:57.562 --> 37:00.054
Why don't you get the HK government
to pay me some compensation?

37:00.054 --> 37:03.723
Not only won't they pay,
but and I have to cough up my own legal fees 

37:04.056 --> 37:07.744
Are you kidding me?
Is this what you call 'everything's sorted'?

37:07.744 --> 37:10.218
You know everything I've done for the force

37:10.218 --> 37:12.237
What have I got out of it?

37:12.237 --> 37:17.108
When I am out, which path will lead to wealth?

37:17.869 --> 37:20.812
There are so many colleagues waiting for your return,
why don't you persevere for a bit longer?

37:20.812 --> 37:23.017
I'm persevering now

37:23.519 --> 37:27.055
How many people are waiting for my return,
just one?

37:27.969 --> 37:30.739
I've forgotten something,
don't wait for me

37:35.815 --> 37:37.396
Slowly ...

37:53.064 --> 37:57.782
Big brother, Tiger and I will return before your trial

37:58.438 --> 38:02.592
I won’t give Wilson or Shan the opportunity to testify

38:17.294 --> 38:18.562
Tiger

38:31.794 --> 38:33.219
Mother

38:36.246 --> 38:39.363
3 sons

38:40.352 --> 38:42.601
I'll take you home

38:45.355 --> 38:48.805
Mother, do you remember this place?

38:48.805 --> 38:50.738
We used to live here

38:50.738 --> 38:54.034
After I pickup Big brother,
we can leave HK

39:34.253 --> 39:35.625
Give me

39:36.145 --> 39:36.903
What are you smiling about?

39:36.903 --> 39:40.043
Nothing.  Perhaps injuring your leg wasn't completely a bad thing

39:40.043 --> 39:41.522
This way you can't run amok every day

39:41.522 --> 39:43.623
And can stay home a keep me company

39:44.188 --> 39:45.717
You've taken care of me for so long

39:45.717 --> 39:47.798
You must like me a lot

39:47.798 --> 39:49.468
Don't you know that in the DNA of every woman

39:49.468 --> 39:52.363
is encoded a natural ability to care for others

39:53.041 --> 39:56.062
On behalf of your godly inherited ability,

39:56.062 --> 39:58.084
I hope that it will be like this forever

39:58.084 --> 39:59.056
Thanks

39:59.056 --> 40:01.101
Don't mention it

40:13.466 --> 40:14.864
They're here

40:16.061 --> 40:17.219
I want to get changed

40:17.219 --> 40:19.153
- Careful
- Quickly

40:21.431 --> 40:22.257
- Hello
- Hello

40:22.257 --> 40:23.675
Delivery

40:25.476 --> 40:27.315
Be careful

40:28.233 --> 40:30.384
Come and have a look.  It's good stuff

40:35.534 --> 40:36.398
Is it that good?

40:36.398 --> 40:37.614
Its heavier than a throne

40:37.614 --> 40:40.201
How can you live on the roof?
I'm so tired

40:40.201 --> 40:41.688
We only helped carry it

40:41.688 --> 40:43.878
Jun, he bought it and delivered it

40:43.878 --> 40:45.594
Where do you want it?

40:46.621 --> 40:47.849
Over there

40:48.096 --> 40:49.264
OK

40:49.264 --> 40:51.944
Move over

40:52.107 --> 40:54.224
Put some muscle into it

40:55.046 --> 40:57.228
Slowly, don't scratch it

40:57.228 --> 40:59.586
That cost over $30k.  He paid for it himself

40:59.586 --> 41:01.994
That's sincerity.  Accept it

41:02.158 --> 41:03.965
Do you have a power board?
- Yes

41:04.216 --> 41:07.379
Here, let me do that.  You guys are so useless

41:07.950 --> 41:09.352
Where's the power point?

41:13.730 --> 41:16.144
I know you're no good with English,
so it's in Chinese

41:16.144 --> 41:18.901
Like driving, it's automatic

41:18.901 --> 41:20.843
Try using this button

41:22.052 --> 41:23.677
You always said that your leg hurt

41:23.677 --> 41:26.164
This can help improve the circulation to your leg

41:26.164 --> 41:30.239
The blood moves freely to the leg,
but the leg itself can't

41:32.616 --> 41:34.830
Walking should be simple for a person
with your intelligence and constitution,

41:34.830 --> 41:37.956
Train your right leg to be as mobile as your
left leg, and you'll be fine

41:40.388 --> 41:41.747
What did you say?

41:41.747 --> 41:44.258
A joke

41:48.821 --> 41:51.670
It’s so funny, but no-ones laughing.
Forget it.

41:56.049 --> 41:57.457
I'll get it

42:00.202 --> 42:01.520
Takeaway delivery

42:03.953 --> 42:05.393
Smells good

42:06.763 --> 42:07.887
What is it?

42:07.887 --> 42:09.018
Something good

42:15.177 --> 42:18.377
Actually as a cop, there's a lot of pressure

42:18.377 --> 42:20.374
Why don't you have a think about
doing something else?

42:21.139 --> 42:24.655
Have a good think about it.
Whatever you do, include me

42:28.635 --> 42:31.747
I'm scared that you'll just hit everything

42:39.418 --> 42:41.402
Actually, the most important thing is having a family

42:41.402 --> 42:43.075
I envy you

42:43.289 --> 42:45.760
What's more important than family?

42:45.866 --> 42:48.511
If you're like me, you'll be happy

42:49.233 --> 42:51.127
Come over and eat

42:58.848 --> 43:00.585
Wait, let's take a picture first

43:00.585 --> 43:01.567
OK, take a picture as we eat

43:01.567 --> 43:03.020
No, picture first

43:03.020 --> 43:04.686
This is my only request

43:05.448 --> 43:06.414
Picture with the chicken?

43:06.414 --> 43:08.650
Whatever, just go with it

43:08.879 --> 43:10.116
Come

43:23.180 --> 43:25.124
The chicken is a bit cold.

43:25.316 --> 43:26.393
Wait

43:26.870 --> 43:27.809
Let's heat it up

43:27.809 --> 43:29.510
If we don't improve our standards, 
how can we become better people?

43:29.510 --> 43:31.862
It doesn't matter, we can still eat it

43:33.075 --> 43:35.724
It’s so easy to heat it up

43:43.819 --> 43:46.307
Chicken, 200 degrees

43:46.307 --> 43:48.570
- I'll go help Inspector Wong
- (So don't eat it, Da Pao)

45:19.268 --> 45:21.190
Is Julie alright?

45:24.040 --> 45:26.194
She's staying for observation

45:31.863 --> 45:33.862
Are you alright?

45:39.147 --> 45:42.006
I'm temporarily standing in for Inspector Wong

45:44.323 --> 45:47.212
For security reasons, you are all placed on leave

45:49.892 --> 45:53.531
They're killing police, and killing witnesses

45:53.910 --> 45:57.174
Even a retard would know that those Vietnamese are behind it.
And you want us to take a break?

45:57.174 --> 45:59.185
I'm worried for your safety

45:59.521 --> 46:01.018
We're all risking our lives

46:01.018 --> 46:03.057
You step in charge, 
and the first thing you do is put us on leave?

46:04.729 --> 46:07.707
You're feeling confused and emotional right now,
please leave

46:09.537 --> 46:12.812
When I was undercover,
I was living under the cover of fear every day

46:12.812 --> 46:14.936
I thought that once I mangled my leg
that I would never have another good day

46:14.936 --> 46:16.850
But even then, they blow up my home

46:16.850 --> 46:18.898
Now you want me to leave?
Madam,

46:18.898 --> 46:21.762
The uniform you're wearing 
was not meant to be so casually abused

46:21.762 --> 46:23.950
If there is sufficient evidence, 
I will arrest the people involved

46:23.950 --> 46:26.257
Do you have any evidence?

46:33.178 --> 46:35.540
You guys ask Madam, 
what else needs to be done

47:43.260 --> 47:46.140
Where is Tony?

47:50.879 --> 47:52.968
Enough!  You're going to kill him

47:55.755 --> 47:57.814
Give me your gun 
Give me your gun

47:57.814 --> 47:59.088
Give me your gun

47:59.898 --> 48:01.114
Give me your gun

48:05.116 --> 48:05.933
Give me your gun

48:05.933 --> 48:09.939
He doesn't know.  Go to court tomorrow

49:36.610 --> 49:39.703
Madam, what do we do now?

49:42.070 --> 49:44.936
The most important thing now,
is to find out what happened to Tony

49:45.368 --> 49:48.291
The most important thing now
is to protect Wilson in hospital

49:48.690 --> 49:50.224
He is the only witness

49:52.219 --> 49:53.325
Xiao Ying, let's go

49:53.325 --> 49:55.389
Let's go, Xiao Ya
What are you still writing?

49:58.213 --> 50:01.150
My mother has a place in the country

50:02.025 --> 50:04.232
I really want to return to Song Flower River

50:05.575 --> 50:07.937
Do you know why it is called Song Flower River?

50:10.175 --> 50:13.366
There was a story from long ago

50:13.366 --> 50:16.337
The Song tree used to be able to bloom

50:16.719 --> 50:21.579
The people from my area, all had to leave to earn a living

50:21.579 --> 50:25.653
Before they left, they would pluck a Song Flower as a memento

50:25.884 --> 50:30.025
They told the tree that they were just borrowing it,
and would definitely come back to return it.

50:31.243 --> 50:33.865
But as they left, one by one

50:33.865 --> 50:36.658
None of them ever returned

50:37.664 --> 50:40.688
In the end, the Song Flower could not blossom

50:41.199 --> 50:43.939
In order to remember it

50:43.939 --> 50:47.390
The people there named the river, the Song Flower River

50:52.103 --> 50:54.201
You're sick of this place?

50:57.071 --> 50:59.895
Actually, living in HK for this long

50:59.895 --> 51:02.537
I've never felt that this place was home

51:07.269 --> 51:09.653
Mother said that she would like us to return

51:10.593 --> 51:13.296
The 3 of us

51:18.390 --> 51:20.647
It's 2 months now

51:28.603 --> 51:31.294
You don't like it?

51:45.723 --> 51:47.462
Everyone entering the hospital must be searched

51:47.462 --> 51:50.760
All the exits, doorways, backdoors, back stairs, toilets,

51:50.760 --> 51:52.482
Must all have men posted.  Understood?

51:52.482 --> 51:53.429
Yes

51:53.429 --> 51:55.862
Nothing must happen to Wilson before he goes to court

51:57.265 --> 51:59.635
The baby's hungry

51:59.761 --> 52:02.027
Should we give it something to eat?

52:02.818 --> 52:05.300
I'll go buy something for you to eat

52:10.202 --> 52:12.393
Don't go anywhere

52:59.698 --> 53:01.549
Inspector Ma, wait

53:01.549 --> 53:03.836
Wilson, Inspector Ma told you not to go anywhere

53:03.836 --> 53:05.423
Thanks

53:17.848 --> 53:20.531
Police!  Move

53:31.891 --> 53:33.360
Shots fired inside elevator.
The elevator is heading for the roof

53:33.360 --> 53:34.951
Get backup.  Quickly

55:10.316 --> 55:11.432
She's here with me

55:11.432 --> 55:12.995
OK

55:12.995 --> 55:14.815
What do you want?

55:15.512 --> 55:16.959
You're scared?

55:16.959 --> 55:18.952
Yes, yes

55:18.952 --> 55:21.820
Whatever you want, just say it.  I'll do anything

55:32.088 --> 55:34.562
Watch out.  You have a death wish?

56:03.898 --> 56:05.410
Move

56:12.493 --> 56:14.098
Mummy

56:16.122 --> 56:17.919
Throw the gun over here

56:18.509 --> 56:20.662
Put the child down

56:20.724 --> 56:22.650
I said throw the gun over

56:24.589 --> 56:26.262
Can you hear me?

56:26.318 --> 56:28.035
Put the child down

56:28.035 --> 56:30.427
Do you want her to die?

59:17.953 --> 59:20.158
Inspector Ma, what's the situation?

59:21.233 --> 59:22.975
Inspector Ma

59:57.913 --> 01:00:00.779
It’s time to go to court

01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:39.126
Hello?

01:00:39.126 --> 01:00:41.078
Wilson, where are you?

01:00:41.078 --> 01:00:42.400
I'm heading off to court

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.504
Did something happen to your Julie?

01:00:46.835 --> 01:00:47.999
Yes

01:00:49.094 --> 01:00:52.611
Don't believe them.  They'll never just let her go

01:00:54.644 --> 01:00:56.565
I have no choice

01:00:57.025 --> 01:00:58.610
How can you not have a choice?

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.536
You've chosen to help those bastards

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.382
I don't want anything to happen to her

01:01:03.382 --> 01:01:05.061
I don't want anything to happen to the both of you

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.607
Do you want to die with her?

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.107
You need to record a statement

01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:46.912
You beat the criminal to death

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.713
Then arrest me

01:01:57.258 --> 01:01:59.883
Witness.  You can now testify

01:02:26.021 --> 01:02:28.370
I don't remember anything

01:02:34.442 --> 01:02:36.211
[?] My judgment is 

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:39.786
The witness is unable to testify because he claims amnesia

01:02:39.786 --> 01:02:42.714
All charges against the accused ...

01:02:42.714 --> 01:02:46.442
are dropped due to lack of evidence

01:03:17.577 --> 01:03:19.072
Tony

01:03:19.582 --> 01:03:21.886
I'm out

01:03:41.393 --> 01:03:44.544
Speak.  Where?

01:03:44.544 --> 01:03:45.767
South ShengWei

01:03:47.077 --> 01:03:50.813
Come quickly.  I'll be waiting

01:03:52.308 --> 01:03:54.621
Stop it.  Don't hit him

01:03:56.012 --> 01:03:57.813
Stop hitting him

01:03:57.813 --> 01:03:59.752
Wilson

01:04:00.157 --> 01:04:02.190
Wilson

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.824
I never thought that I would be able to leave

01:04:06.824 --> 01:04:09.877
I just want you to let her go

01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:13.471
Wilson

01:06:31.124 --> 01:06:33.335
Shoot, shoot him, Tony

01:06:35.496 --> 01:06:37.660
Come on, you scared?

01:06:37.965 --> 01:06:40.484
Drop the gun, drop the gun

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:41.566
Your momma ...

01:06:41.566 --> 01:06:42.719
- Bastard
- Shoot

01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:44.087
Don't talk about my mother!

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:07.623
Boss

01:07:35.827 --> 01:07:37.137
I'm going to kill you two bastards

01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:42.136
Fuck

01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:31.359
I'll drive

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:46.493
Open the door

01:09:46.493 --> 01:09:48.682
What are you thinking?  Open the door

01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:50.349
What are you doing?

01:09:50.808 --> 01:09:54.033
Leave with me.  Don't go back

01:09:54.264 --> 01:09:57.381
Leave with me.  You promised you wouldn't go

01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:15.298
Ma Jun, come out and fight

01:10:35.153 --> 01:10:36.563
Fuck you

01:10:38.907 --> 01:10:40.217
Ammo

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:11.150
Mother

01:15:12.984 --> 01:15:17.097
I have three sons, they're missing

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:20.060
Have you seen them?

01:15:30.474 --> 01:15:33.993
I've lost my 3 sons

01:15:33.993 --> 01:15:37.650
Can you help find them for me?

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:43.073
Have you seen them?  I have 3 sons ...

01:15:43.073 --> 01:15:46.373
I have 3 sons ...

01:15:47.508 --> 01:15:50.556
Have you seen them?

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.116
You're finished, Tony

01:22:57.298 --> 01:23:00.464
All the time I've been in the force,
have I ever arrested the wrong person?

01:23:00.464 --> 01:23:03.372
This question, I'll leave to the judge

01:23:03.372 --> 01:23:06.403
My philosophy is ...

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:08.582
that cops catch crooks

01:23:08.582 --> 01:23:11.420
Everything that I've done ...

01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:14.132
Has been to maintain the peace.
