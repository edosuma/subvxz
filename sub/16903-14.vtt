00:21.839 --> 00:23.077
Lemon.

00:23.145 --> 00:25.087
When you were watching me
after my oral surgery,

00:25.155 --> 00:27.331
Did I put a toaster waffle
into my dvd player?

00:27.398 --> 00:29.273
You did. You watched it
for about an hour,

00:29.341 --> 00:30.916
Said nicole kidman should get
an oscar for it,

00:30.983 --> 00:32.387
Then you turned it off.
Yikes.

00:32.459 --> 00:33.663
Thanks for babysitting me.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.504
I did my best,
but you were pretty far gone.

00:35.572 --> 00:38.279
You kept trying to order
home massages off of craigslist.

00:38.347 --> 00:40.321
[gasps]
good thing you were here.

00:40.389 --> 00:41.527
[knock at door]

00:41.595 --> 00:43.468
Hey, somebody order
a massage?

00:43.536 --> 00:44.505
Oh, brother.

00:44.573 --> 00:46.009
[masculine voice]
you're too late!

00:46.077 --> 00:47.816
I already killed her!

00:47.884 --> 00:49.320
[groans]

00:49.388 --> 00:51.027
Well played, lemon.

00:52.198 --> 00:53.468
[door opens]

00:53.538 --> 00:55.375
You went running?
I thought you'd left.

00:55.443 --> 00:57.047
Who else is out there
this early?

00:57.115 --> 00:58.653
Almost exclusively women
that look like me.

00:58.721 --> 01:01.093
If the pervert community
gets wind of morning jogging,

01:01.160 --> 01:02.263
[grunts]
god help us.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.499
Have you seen this?

01:03.569 --> 01:07.111
They keep talking
about sheinhardt selling nbc

01:07.179 --> 01:09.218
To, uh, kabletown.
That's never gonna happen.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.958
How could a company
from philadelphia

01:11.026 --> 01:13.098
Buy a company
from new york?

01:13.166 --> 01:15.071
That would be like vietnam
defeating the United States

01:15.139 --> 01:16.308
In a ground war.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.214
I don't know, jack.
My sources...

01:18.282 --> 01:19.653
Well, I'm telling you
that don geiss and I

01:19.721 --> 01:21.991
Spoke about this,
and that sale is dead.

01:22.058 --> 01:23.293
Look, I read
his autobiography,

01:23.361 --> 01:24.964
<i>Geiss cubes,</i>
whatever that means.

01:25.031 --> 01:28.137
It means the book is filled
with cubes of knowledge.

01:28.205 --> 01:29.473
It's a good title.

01:29.541 --> 01:31.476
The principles in this book
are timeless.

01:31.544 --> 01:33.479
I could open to any page...

01:33.547 --> 01:35.514
"because a woman's brain
has fewer folds--"

01:35.583 --> 01:37.285
Okay, hang on.

01:37.353 --> 01:39.792
"the negroid musculature..."

01:39.859 --> 01:42.665
Nobody's buying anybody.

01:43.835 --> 01:45.437
Hey.
Where is frank?

01:45.505 --> 01:47.109
He still hasn't rewritten
the olympic sketch

01:47.177 --> 01:50.216
About the <i>lindsey vonn</i> who won
the <i>gold medal for skiing.</i>

01:50.283 --> 01:52.788
Oh, mr. Rossitano called
to say he overslept,

01:52.856 --> 01:54.659
And I should make up
an excuse for him.

01:54.727 --> 01:56.028
So here goes--

01:56.096 --> 01:58.533
On his way to work,
he found some magic beans,

01:58.601 --> 02:00.203
And because he believed
in them--

02:00.271 --> 02:01.206
Ship up.

02:01.273 --> 02:04.446
Frank, frank, frank.

02:04.513 --> 02:05.548
What is this?

02:05.617 --> 02:06.918
"future husband"?

02:06.986 --> 02:08.655
Who did you put
in your address book

02:08.723 --> 02:09.757
As "future husband"?

02:09.824 --> 02:12.026
I have absolutely no idea.

02:12.094 --> 02:13.861
Well, whenever I find
something weird

02:13.929 --> 02:15.564
In my cell phone,
I can usually trace it back

02:15.632 --> 02:16.933
To the last time
I was drunk.

02:17.001 --> 02:20.073
Oh, my god,
the dentist's office.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.408
Oh, your dentist gets drunk
with you too?

02:21.476 --> 02:23.245
No! When I was
under the anesthesia,

02:23.313 --> 02:25.382
I did a bunch of stuff
I don't remember.

02:25.450 --> 02:28.756
[gasps] including meeting
the man of your dreams?

02:28.824 --> 02:31.961
Oh, miss lemon,
it's so romantic,

02:32.029 --> 02:34.432
Just like that movie I only saw
the first ten minutes of,

02:34.500 --> 02:35.701
<i>Fatal attraction.</i>

02:35.769 --> 02:37.805
Liz, you have to call him.

02:37.873 --> 02:40.476
What? No. I was out of my mind
on painkillers.

02:40.543 --> 02:42.379
I have zero memory
of this guy.

02:42.447 --> 02:44.382
I don't know what he looks like.
He could be a serial killer.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.921
[gasps]
he could wear a thumb ring.

02:46.988 --> 02:49.558
Miss lemon,
you're such a pessimist.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.395
You know
what my motto is?

02:51.462 --> 02:53.666
Everything always works out
for the best.

02:55.369 --> 02:57.906
Watch this.

02:57.974 --> 02:59.108
[tires screech, crash]

02:59.175 --> 03:01.311
I just threw my wallet
out the window,

03:01.379 --> 03:03.115
But I'm not worried.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.755
Why? Because everything always
works out for the best.

03:06.822 --> 03:07.990
I'm sorry.

03:08.058 --> 03:09.993
How is that supposed
to make me call this guy?

03:10.061 --> 03:11.763
Be an optimist,
miss lemon.

03:11.831 --> 03:13.299

03:40.312 --> 03:41.914
I think we got it.

03:41.982 --> 03:43.416
Okay.
Good first take.

03:43.484 --> 03:44.752
Maybe we go one more time.

03:44.820 --> 03:45.887
Excuse me?

03:45.954 --> 03:47.321
Do you know
who you're talking to?

A future tony-nominated actor.

That's right.

It is tony-eligibility season.

And I'm going for the "t"

03:56.293 --> 03:58.893
Really?
You've been cast on broadway?

03:58.961 --> 04:00.694
I'm doing a one-man show.

04:00.761 --> 04:02.262

Tonight.

I'm gonna keep it loose,
liz lemon.

Jonathan!

04:12.972 --> 04:15.073
Jonathan, why is it
so quiet in here?

04:15.140 --> 04:16.940
Why aren't the phones ringing?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.608
Is it senior executive
skip day?

04:18.676 --> 04:19.774
That's usually in the spring,

04:19.843 --> 04:21.942
So we can go
to an amusement park.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.012
No, sir,
I don't understand.

04:24.079 --> 04:25.780
Maybe we're the last people
on earth.

over there, huh?

04:35.422 --> 04:36.422
What do you mean?
Come on.

04:36.490 --> 04:38.390
The nbc buyout.
What's happening today?

04:38.458 --> 04:40.592
I'm sorry.
You're calling me as a source?

04:40.660 --> 04:41.726
How are you going to explain

04:41.794 --> 04:43.428
Your unnamed executive
to your producer?

04:43.496 --> 04:45.062
I'll tell him it's a guy
I'm having sex with.

04:46.598 --> 04:48.465
We really don't have time
to do it right anymore.

04:48.533 --> 04:49.666
So what do you want
to know?

04:49.734 --> 04:51.235
Okay, I know the deal
is happening today.

04:51.302 --> 04:52.769
The board's having
a secret meeting.

04:52.837 --> 04:53.770
I just need a confirmation.

04:53.838 --> 04:55.071
Wait, what?
No.

04:55.139 --> 04:56.639
I already told you
this morning.

04:56.707 --> 04:58.741
There's no deal.
Oh, my god.

04:58.809 --> 05:00.142
You really don't know
what's going on.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.610
They cut you
out of the loop, jack,

05:01.678 --> 05:02.711
Because you're against it.

05:02.779 --> 05:04.012
No, no, no,
I'm not out of the loop.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.313
I just can't talk about it.

05:05.381 --> 05:07.281
I'm actually finishing up
a meeting right now.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.149
Rhubarb, rhubarb,
golf, prostate.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.617
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

05:10.684 --> 05:12.418
[phone clicks]

05:12.486 --> 05:15.887
Jonathan,
I want you to go down

05:15.954 --> 05:17.754
Into your little
assistant underworld

05:17.822 --> 05:19.322
And find out
where everybody is.

05:19.390 --> 05:20.390
I don't care
what it takes.

05:20.457 --> 05:22.859
This is a matter of life...

05:22.927 --> 05:24.260
Or death.

05:24.328 --> 05:27.029
Yes, sir. But if anything
should happen to me,

05:27.097 --> 05:29.031
I want you to read
<i>oh, the places you'll go!</i>

05:29.099 --> 05:30.400
At my funeral.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.470
I'm not doing that.

05:33.538 --> 05:34.605
Rinse, please.

05:34.673 --> 05:37.241
Well, you're healing
very nicely.

05:37.308 --> 05:40.143
You may continue to experience
sensitivity for a few more days.

05:40.211 --> 05:43.079
When can I start eating
hard cheeses again, doctor?

05:43.147 --> 05:46.581
I've had this pamphlet
printed up.

05:46.649 --> 05:48.816
It was expensive,
but I'm really tired

05:48.884 --> 05:51.152
Of discussing this with you.

05:51.219 --> 05:52.252
Huh.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.821
Dr. Kaplan,
the last time I was here,

05:54.889 --> 05:58.157
I think I made
a gentleman friend.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.126
But because of the anesthesia,
I can't remember

06:00.193 --> 06:01.226
Where or how.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.527
Well, there was
another patient

06:02.595 --> 06:04.629
In the recovery room with you.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.466
And I remember you were
both laughing quite a bit.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.033
Okay.
So, uh, who is he?

06:10.101 --> 06:11.435
What does he look like?

06:11.503 --> 06:14.206
He has some gum recession--
four pockets on 14 and 15,

06:14.274 --> 06:17.509
But, overall, very good teeth,
especially for an englishman.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.644
Ooh, he's english?
I've said too much.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.712
I really can't tell you
anything about him--

06:21.780 --> 06:24.214
You know,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

06:24.282 --> 06:27.817
Ah, come on. I mean,
you're not really a doctor.

06:27.885 --> 06:29.185
Well, if that's
how you feel,

06:29.253 --> 06:30.587
Then you're not really
a patient.

06:30.654 --> 06:31.821
And people who aren't patients

06:31.889 --> 06:34.457
Don't get toys
from the treat bucket.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.558
But there's a batman in there!
Yeah.

06:36.626 --> 06:39.294
And if you wind him up,
he swims in the bath.

06:39.362 --> 06:40.762
Damn you, kaplan!

06:42.163 --> 06:43.063
Who's here?

06:43.264 --> 06:45.464
I need someone to be
outraged too.

06:46.965 --> 06:48.765
uh... I'm here, miss Maroney.

06:48.766 --> 06:52.266
I actually slept here because
my house keys are in my wallet.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.567
It wasn't to bad.

06:53.568 --> 06:55.268
Late at night these two little twin girls

06:55.269 --> 06:56.269
 told me they wanted
to play with me forever.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.050
Have you seen this?

06:59.118 --> 07:01.552
Is that a macy's
thanksgiving day parade pun?

07:01.620 --> 07:02.820
In March?

07:02.888 --> 07:04.555
It's a rave review...

07:04.623 --> 07:05.889
For tracy.

07:05.957 --> 07:07.891
It's as if
claps-giving yay ha-rade

07:07.959 --> 07:09.893
Has lost all meaning.

07:09.961 --> 07:12.262
I did it.
I'm a broadway star.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.764
Jenna, could you accept my tony
on my behalf?

07:14.832 --> 07:16.332
June is a tough month for me

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
Because
I begin lifeguarding again.

07:18.468 --> 07:19.901
You know, renting a theater
for one night

07:19.969 --> 07:21.269
And babbling on stage
for an hour--

07:21.337 --> 07:22.303
Five hours.

07:22.371 --> 07:23.805
Doesn't make you
an actor.

07:23.872 --> 07:25.573
I don't know.
People seem to like it.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.741
Well, it certainly
doesn't get you a tony award.

07:27.809 --> 07:29.209
I know the tony rules,

07:29.277 --> 07:30.844
Because I've been petitioning
for them to add a category

07:30.911 --> 07:33.412
For living theatrically
in normal life.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.080
And I know for a fact
you have to do your show

07:35.148 --> 07:37.816
A minimum of eight times
to be eligible.

07:37.884 --> 07:38.950
Wait.
The same show?

07:39.018 --> 07:41.652
[laughing]
of course the same show.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.188
But I can't do that.
I'm a spontaneous actor.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.423
I never do
the same thing twice.

07:46.491 --> 07:48.291
Action.

07:48.359 --> 07:50.193
Honey, I'm home.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.661
Pac-man, I'm jewish.

07:52.729 --> 07:55.630
Jeffrey,
we lost the tournament.

07:55.698 --> 07:58.799
I can't do
seven more performances.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.367
Well, then you better think
of something else

08:00.435 --> 08:02.269
That starts with "t"

17:31.572 --> 17:34.308
Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.045
To sit in darkness
in a sharp, sharp shop

17:37.112 --> 17:39.013
In darkness and sitting
in the sharp.

17:39.081 --> 17:41.381
This is stupid.
This is not stupid.

17:41.449 --> 17:44.785
These are the building blocks
of the craft of acting--

17:44.853 --> 17:47.120
Something I have dedicated
my life to

17:47.188 --> 17:50.624
Ever since my very first job
as baby stuck in well

17:50.692 --> 17:52.060
In a commercial
for well guards.

17:52.128 --> 17:53.462
[clears throat]

17:53.530 --> 17:55.297
Well guards--

17:55.365 --> 17:57.633
Guard your well...

17:57.700 --> 17:59.067
Well.

17:59.135 --> 18:01.403
I remember
that commercial.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.706
You were a fat baby.

18:03.774 --> 18:06.242
Well, maybe we're
just gonna have to agree

18:06.310 --> 18:08.077
To disagree
on the acting process.

18:08.145 --> 18:09.845
You have no process.

18:09.913 --> 18:11.914
Acting is the discipline
of being someone else

18:11.982 --> 18:13.082
At all times.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.383
I don't know.

18:14.451 --> 18:16.185
When I'm acting,
I just do me,

18:16.252 --> 18:17.753
And people seem
to love it.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.188
Well, then I guess
you don't need my help.

18:19.255 --> 18:21.489
Go out there
and be yourself.

18:21.557 --> 18:25.920
Go onstage and read the damn
phone book for all I care.

18:25.988 --> 18:27.887
What are you gonna do,
mr. Jordan?

18:27.954 --> 18:30.152
Do you think you can repeat
your performance?

18:30.220 --> 18:31.818
Your performance.

18:33.354 --> 18:35.622
Liz...

18:35.690 --> 18:37.058
Do you work here?
Yeah.

18:37.126 --> 18:38.493
Remember, at coffee,

18:38.561 --> 18:40.061
You said you hadn't seen
the show,

18:40.129 --> 18:41.229
But you'd heard bad things.

18:41.296 --> 18:43.464
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?

18:43.532 --> 18:45.466
I'm supposed to meet
kenneth parcell.

18:45.534 --> 18:46.467
I found his wallet.

18:46.535 --> 18:48.169
What?

18:48.236 --> 18:51.705
You must be
my wallet angel.

18:51.772 --> 18:53.439
No.
This is not possible.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.641
But it is.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.175
I knew my wallet
would turn up.

18:56.243 --> 18:57.677
And it did.

18:57.744 --> 19:01.680
No, kenneth, this is wesley
from the dentist's office.

19:01.747 --> 19:02.980
Oh, my goodness.

19:03.048 --> 19:05.948
This is the guy
from the dentist's office.

19:06.016 --> 19:08.350
He found my wallet.

19:08.418 --> 19:09.651
[chuckles, grunts]

19:09.719 --> 19:12.354
I'm either very happy
right now,

19:12.422 --> 19:14.255
Or I'm having
a pretty bad donkey spell.

19:14.323 --> 19:16.557
[brays like a donkey]

19:16.625 --> 19:19.762
I'm okay.
It'll pass.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.331
This is crazy.

19:22.399 --> 19:24.434
I guess we have to give it
another shot.

19:24.501 --> 19:27.103
I guess we do.

19:27.171 --> 19:29.072
Dinner tonight?
Perfect.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.274
Do you like tex-mex?

19:31.342 --> 19:33.610
No, I don't.

19:33.678 --> 19:36.947
See you there.

19:37.014 --> 19:38.582
The fcc will now investigate

19:38.649 --> 19:40.884
This large-scale,
multimillion-dollar sale

19:40.951 --> 19:41.918
To kabletown.

19:41.985 --> 19:44.286
And now
the $5.6 billion question--

19:44.354 --> 19:45.454
Who will take the reins

19:45.522 --> 19:47.422
Of the cable giant's
new acquisition?

19:47.490 --> 19:50.257
According to my sources,
the clear frontrunner--

19:50.325 --> 19:53.060
Current g.E. Executive
jack donaghy.

19:53.127 --> 19:55.863
The people I'm talking to
say he's the only guy out there

19:55.931 --> 19:58.934
With the programming experience,
business savvy,

19:59.001 --> 20:01.803
And piercing blue eyes
of a siberian husky

20:01.871 --> 20:03.472
That the job requires.

20:03.539 --> 20:04.506
[phones buzzing and ringing]

20:04.574 --> 20:05.907
I'm told donaghy
was instrumental

20:05.975 --> 20:07.976
In making this deal happen,
and I spoke to him earlier.

20:08.044 --> 20:11.613
He refused to speculate but
did say, and I'm quoting here,

20:11.681 --> 20:14.816
"I'm going to celebrate
by buying my lady friend

20:14.884 --> 20:16.418
"that necklace she pointed out

20:16.485 --> 20:19.387
And then cooking her
a western omelet."

20:19.455 --> 20:20.555
End quote.

20:20.623 --> 20:22.758
And then I'm gonna braid
your hair.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.228

Bravo!
Triumph!
