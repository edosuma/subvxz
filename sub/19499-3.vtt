WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:02.132
- I need you to check on someone.

00:02.601 --> 00:04.383
A character called John Spode.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.793
He may be Resistance, so draw a pistol,

00:06.910 --> 00:08.259
and keep your wits about you.

00:08.310 --> 00:11.244
He doesn't have the experience
to handle a case like this.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.462
It is too dangerous for him.

00:15.751 --> 00:17.549
Why was I invited here this evening?

00:17.852 --> 00:21.274
We need nothing of you,
except loyalty to your country.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.346
Have you heard the rumours
that the King is unwell?

00:23.372 --> 00:25.322
You can't be thinking of
trying to free him?

00:26.121 --> 00:28.360
I'm telling you, don't go back there
and say, "No deal."

00:28.630 --> 00:29.749
What if I did?

00:29.858 --> 00:30.986
Then they'd kill you.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.909
Gallant British patriots.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.617
- Are you proud of them?
- Jimmy!

00:34.743 --> 00:35.949
This is your doing.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

01:00.699 --> 01:02.418
- Archer!
- General Kellermann.

01:05.826 --> 01:09.171
Molotov, Von Ribbentrop
and Goebbels.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.514
What a trio.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.225
Putting all your eggs
in the basket, yes?

01:15.854 --> 01:17.156
But after the Mall incident,

01:17.182 --> 01:20.606
I am sure the Army will be
keeping a tighter watch.

01:24.894 --> 01:26.637
Hauptsturmfuhrer Schroder.

01:29.212 --> 01:30.329
<i>Ich finde es ganz wunderbar,</i>

01:30.353 --> 01:33.108
<i>dass Sie jetzt die Reichsleitung
der NSDAP hier vertreten.</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:36.020
<i>Ich habe Ihre Rede gehrt,
anfang des Monats.</i>

01:38.070 --> 01:39.917
<i>Ausgezeichnet. Klar und...</i>

01:40.441 --> 01:41.595
<i>visionr.</i>

01:42.080 --> 01:43.240
<i>Weiter so.</i>

03:55.842 --> 03:59.949
Do you think Marx's corpse will
prefer the mausoleum in Moscow?

04:00.473 --> 04:01.712
The Russians think so.

04:01.807 --> 04:03.079
Isn't that what's important?

04:04.983 --> 04:06.062
Take a seat.

04:06.156 --> 04:07.196
Thank you, sir.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.780
Are you an angler, Superintendent?

04:13.660 --> 04:14.661
No, sir.

04:14.723 --> 04:15.724
Pity.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.058
I caught that fellow, Superintendent.

04:21.283 --> 04:22.380
Really, sir?

04:26.860 --> 04:31.179
Standartenfuhrer Huth, on the
other hand, is a ski champion.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.120
He went to Garmisch
for the 1936 Olympics.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.581
For the combined downhill
and slalom event.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.288
He won no medals.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.031
But it is a distinction to compete?

04:46.578 --> 04:47.555
Of course, sir.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.796
The sport a man chooses tells you
a lot about his personality.

04:51.272 --> 04:53.915
Standartenfuhrer Huth
is always in a hurry.

04:55.905 --> 04:57.313
I am never in a hurry.

04:58.494 --> 05:00.212
Do you understand, Superintendent?

05:07.180 --> 05:08.907
It takes patience...

05:09.949 --> 05:12.293
to make a lure that works...

05:13.405 --> 05:17.296
that the fish will swallow
without even knowing it.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.315
Are you sure you won't have cream?

05:28.354 --> 05:30.035
The Reichsfuhrer-SS, Heinrich Himmler,

05:30.060 --> 05:33.115
was asking me about developments
on this murder you're working on,

05:33.140 --> 05:34.508
the one in Shepherd Market.

05:36.107 --> 05:37.303
Developments?

05:38.020 --> 05:39.056
Yes, sir.

05:40.395 --> 05:41.947
The death of a good policeman.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.408
Investigating what?

05:43.869 --> 05:47.108
A photograph of a Professor Frick
and his colleagues

05:47.655 --> 05:49.212
was found in the suspect's house.

05:51.706 --> 05:52.713
Well...

05:53.466 --> 05:56.794
what do you think this all means?
Who is this Professor Frick?

05:57.540 --> 05:59.115
An atomic expert.

05:59.298 --> 06:00.642
Like Dr. Spode was.

06:03.005 --> 06:05.791
So this explains Standartenfuhrer
Huth's arrival, do you think...

06:05.817 --> 06:07.122
the atomic business?

06:08.406 --> 06:09.677
I suspect so, yes.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.734
I'd like to be kept up-to-date
on all this, Superintendent.

06:16.257 --> 06:19.443
You are doing a fine job
assisting Herr Dr. Huth,

06:19.581 --> 06:23.398
but please don't exclude the leader
of your police force?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.616
Good fellow.

06:35.425 --> 06:37.540
- Here he is.
- Yeah.

07:03.952 --> 07:05.163
Go on, then... say it.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.562
I went over.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.540
Told his mother.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.190
Jimmy was her last boy left.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.574
- Whoever did this...
- No, it's you, Doug.

07:20.581 --> 07:21.605
You did this.

07:22.121 --> 07:23.161
Right.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.799
Cos I should have stuck with you.

07:28.462 --> 07:29.850
They'd have left you alone.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.277
Cos you're one of them.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.586
Get me the fingerprinting kit.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.566
Even I know it takes all sorts
to make up the Resistance, Harry.

07:46.303 --> 07:49.115
There are those that put sugar
in German petrol tanks,

07:49.215 --> 07:52.614
and those that scrawl anti-Nazi
slogans on walls. Fine.

07:53.419 --> 07:56.049
But then there are those that are
willing to kill boys like Jimmy,

07:56.361 --> 07:58.939
just to get a point across
to their own bloody people.

07:59.757 --> 08:03.267
Can you not understand
people's anger?

08:03.519 --> 08:04.634
They feel helpless.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.068
They see us working with
the Germans and they lash out,

08:07.094 --> 08:09.340
- and can you really blame them?
- Yes, I bloody can!

08:11.300 --> 08:12.428
Then you're a fool.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.520
And you're out of touch,
and that will ruin you as a copper.

08:18.941 --> 08:20.466
For Christ's sakes, Harry.

08:21.592 --> 08:24.096
What they did is no better
than the bloody Nazis.

08:30.909 --> 08:32.860
So what do you believe in, Dougie?

08:33.578 --> 08:34.654
Justice.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.182
Was this justice for Jimmy?

08:38.721 --> 08:40.221
I don't know these people.

08:42.169 --> 08:43.634
Well, they're bloody animals.

08:48.693 --> 08:49.879
<i>Who do you know?</i>

08:56.753 --> 08:58.660
It's too dangerous for
you, too, isn't it?

09:00.767 --> 09:02.167
Maybe it's time to quit.

09:02.940 --> 09:03.955
I'd understand.

09:03.980 --> 09:05.100
Not on your life.

09:08.002 --> 09:09.479
There are no prints on this.

09:10.813 --> 09:12.326
They've wiped it clean.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.315
So much for the heat of anger.

09:15.340 --> 09:16.380
Like I said...

09:17.222 --> 09:19.686
I do not know these people.

09:20.837 --> 09:22.077
Well, that's a shame.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.660
Cos I'd like to think...

09:27.980 --> 09:29.820
you'd have helped me
try and get them.

09:34.645 --> 09:35.979
There's nothing I can do.

09:40.276 --> 09:43.555
These people will turn on
anyone they start to doubt.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.155
Yeah, well, don't you worry about me.

09:45.391 --> 09:47.215
- Like I said...
- I'm not worried about you.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.985
You know where she is.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.702
Tell Sylvia she should get out.

10:02.463 --> 10:05.102
Join that cousin of yours
in the unoccupied zone.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.500
She won't listen to me.

10:14.020 --> 10:15.460
Let me try and persuade her.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.940
Where is she?

10:21.122 --> 10:22.162
You won't like it.

10:49.660 --> 10:50.700
Hello?

10:58.718 --> 10:59.813
It's all right.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.020
I'm alone.

11:03.342 --> 11:04.502
What do you want?

11:05.948 --> 11:06.948
Help.

11:09.695 --> 11:11.470
Not going to kick me out, then?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.426
I don't see any harm in you being here.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.039
It's not a crime scene any more.

11:17.628 --> 11:19.948
I was the one who helped you
get away, remember?

11:23.736 --> 11:25.262
Who killed Jimmy Dunn?

11:25.794 --> 11:27.662
- I don't know anything.
- You know too much.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.288
And if the Germans catch you,
they'll make sure they know it, too.

11:32.408 --> 11:34.603
And take great pleasure in it, I'm sure.

11:45.598 --> 11:47.103
Don't stay here, Sylvia.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.150
Leave the controlled zone...
go to the Lakes.

11:50.623 --> 11:51.848
You sound like Harry.

11:52.397 --> 11:53.699
He's worried about you.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.195
And these people you think
are your friends...

11:58.220 --> 11:59.420
Shut up about it, OK?

12:03.669 --> 12:04.972
If you were going to visit...

12:05.710 --> 12:07.286
you could have brought some food.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.452
Goodbye, Sylvia.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.235
No! No!

12:59.260 --> 13:00.515
Let him go!

13:00.738 --> 13:02.035
Let him go!

13:05.942 --> 13:07.590
We know what we're doing.

13:13.537 --> 13:14.952
Let him go!

13:33.550 --> 13:35.525
Scotland Yard duty officer, please.

13:37.714 --> 13:39.073
Is that the duty officer?

13:40.769 --> 13:43.129
This is Detective Superintendent
Douglas Archer.

13:44.340 --> 13:46.391
Something might be coming for me
in the second post.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.537
It's very important...
can you look out for it for me?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.329
Yes.

13:55.446 --> 13:56.486
Thank you.

15:27.220 --> 15:28.260
You all right?

15:29.270 --> 15:30.688
Call Scotland Yard,

15:32.300 --> 15:33.853
tell them to collect a body,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.580
and cut the power!

17:01.031 --> 17:03.271
Some of the teachers haven't
come back to the school yet.

17:05.103 --> 17:06.275
Any idea where they are?

17:07.140 --> 17:08.201
No.

17:10.757 --> 17:11.926
That smart, does it?

17:13.775 --> 17:14.913
I'll live.

17:16.623 --> 17:18.164
It's a nasty one, all right.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.080
Why did he attack you?

17:25.660 --> 17:26.811
You know why.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.964
Some people think police
are helping the Germans.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.915
If your Tom hadn't signed up
with the army reservists,

17:38.940 --> 17:40.464
he'd be in the same position.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.854
Why didn't you sign up, Mr. Archer?

17:51.100 --> 17:52.473
I wasn't allowed...

17:55.020 --> 17:56.434
reserved occupation.

18:04.957 --> 18:08.231
Well, I'd rather have Tom here
than him being a hero.

18:10.740 --> 18:11.952
Not that, I mean...

18:15.060 --> 18:16.299
I know what you mean.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.996
- Thank you, Mrs. Sheenan.
- No, well...

18:27.617 --> 18:29.042
I like this record.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.096
I first heard it with my wife.

18:38.587 --> 18:41.743
We were at the Old Florida Club,
in Bruton Mews.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.406
Snakehips Johnson played that night.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.061
It went on till five in the morning.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.396
I thought the Germans
had banned this music.

19:00.255 --> 19:01.420
They have.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.115
They label it degenerate,

19:06.105 --> 19:07.535
but secretly they love it.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.681
I got this from a Feldwebel.

19:13.608 --> 19:16.442
I swapped it, like a kid in school.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.800
You're lucky you still have
something to hear it with.

19:28.940 --> 19:31.220
- Got any more for upstairs?
- Thank you.

19:33.174 --> 19:34.369
Any post for me?

19:34.660 --> 19:35.860
Yes, sir.

19:40.058 --> 19:41.818
- All right?
- Right you are.

20:13.739 --> 20:16.033
Anything interesting in the second post?

20:20.358 --> 20:22.189
Dunn was looking for leads on Frick.

20:22.501 --> 20:24.823
It seems the Professor's been
written out of history.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.045
But why use the mail?

20:29.231 --> 20:31.497
Jimmy must have seen that
he was being followed...

20:31.990 --> 20:34.415
wanted to make sure this didn't fall
into the wrong hands.

20:34.847 --> 20:37.219
A caution, no doubt, instilled by you.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.646
It might be a bitter pill to swallow,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.805
but you're very much like us,
Superintendent.

20:44.293 --> 20:45.293
Excellent.

20:45.684 --> 20:47.595
Have some "wanted"
posters made from that.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.315
We'll put every name on that photograph

20:49.340 --> 20:50.905
on a primary arrest sheet.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.715
For the murder of Dr. Spode?

20:52.740 --> 20:54.635
For questioning in connection
with the murder.

20:54.660 --> 20:57.361
But aren't we assuming they're under
the protection of the German Army?

20:57.385 --> 20:59.905
That will force the Army
to actually admit it.

21:02.445 --> 21:03.486
What's that?

21:04.038 --> 21:06.198
That's just an index from
the photo library.

21:08.914 --> 21:10.342
Do you have anything else?

21:11.257 --> 21:12.257
Nothing.

21:16.557 --> 21:17.986
Time is a sickle, Archer.

21:18.325 --> 21:19.591
This fellow must be caught.

21:19.799 --> 21:20.799
Of course.

21:35.989 --> 21:37.056
Papers.

21:37.620 --> 21:38.740
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

22:04.900 --> 22:05.911
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

22:06.282 --> 22:07.231
Hello.

22:07.257 --> 22:08.860
Superintendent Douglas Archer.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.605
Captain Hesse.

22:10.631 --> 22:14.044
You wish to visit the issuing
department, that's correct?

22:14.582 --> 22:16.225
If I could.

22:18.261 --> 22:21.408
Do you have a willing workforce
here, Captain?

22:21.690 --> 22:23.755
We have British and Allied officers

22:23.937 --> 22:25.980
of the rank of brigadier and upwards...

22:26.596 --> 22:28.891
making artificial limbs
provides work for them.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.803
And I wish to meet
one of their customers.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.354
Who gets limbs here?

22:38.596 --> 22:42.251
British ex-servicemen who live in
the southeastern control zone.

22:42.518 --> 22:45.035
And what documentation do they
need to get through that door?

22:45.060 --> 22:47.515
No-one gets past even the outer
gate without a pay-book,

22:47.540 --> 22:49.554
proving discharge from the British Army.

22:50.464 --> 22:52.756
When was the last time you sent
someone to try and gain access

22:52.780 --> 22:53.913
without those papers?

22:55.289 --> 22:56.808
Do you want me to alert the sentries?

22:57.391 --> 22:59.756
No, that's the last thing I want.
I want my man to get through.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.804
Where do you keep
your elbow-joints and pivots?

23:02.740 --> 23:04.195
Is that a joke?

23:04.260 --> 23:06.440
No. When I make jokes, I waggle my ears.

23:06.721 --> 23:09.123
There should be an elbow-pivot
here for John Spode.

23:18.140 --> 23:19.782
I'm hoping to make an arrest, Captain.

23:21.502 --> 23:22.901
I hope not here.

23:23.548 --> 23:25.214
This is an army establishment...

23:25.380 --> 23:28.215
it's nothing to do with
the Civil Police or the SS.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.930
But I'm investigating a murder.

23:30.391 --> 23:32.555
The British Army always allowed
the Civil Police...

23:32.580 --> 23:34.572
I'm not interested in ancient history.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.435
This camp, it's under
German Army jurisdiction,

23:38.460 --> 23:39.948
and you have no powers here.

23:40.790 --> 23:41.804
Fine.

23:43.220 --> 23:47.140
Then I'll wait outside the gate
and arrest him off army property.

23:48.729 --> 23:52.540
You would be in grave danger of
being shot down by my sentries.

23:57.940 --> 23:58.940
Why?

23:59.660 --> 24:00.954
I won't be using a gun.

24:09.988 --> 24:11.053
Herr Archer...

24:12.942 --> 24:14.329
there's no need for this.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.275
These walls are secure.

24:18.564 --> 24:20.475
Much safer to arrest your man here.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.721
I will make an exception.

24:46.579 --> 24:47.699
You must be hungry.

24:49.056 --> 24:50.078
<i>Danke.</i>

25:24.812 --> 25:27.127
How long do you plan on
keeping up this vigil?

25:28.580 --> 25:30.324
Why not let us take over?

25:31.740 --> 25:34.740
You go back and, if he comes,
we will apprehend him.

25:36.053 --> 25:37.313
Well, that's not your job.

25:40.125 --> 25:41.282
And he will come.

26:38.874 --> 26:40.075
Listen to me. Listen to me!

26:40.100 --> 26:41.955
We don't have much time.
I can help you, Spode.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.497
I know you burned the plans.
Did you make copies? Photographs?

26:44.620 --> 26:46.431
You know who I am. I can help you.

26:47.349 --> 26:48.349
You?

26:50.509 --> 26:51.878
You fool.

26:58.069 --> 26:59.435
John Spode, you're under arrest.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.405
For what?

27:00.431 --> 27:01.500
Murder.

27:03.168 --> 27:06.328
I warn you, anything you say may be taken
down and used in evidence against you.

27:07.660 --> 27:08.700
Come on.

27:15.100 --> 27:19.712
Are you John Spode,
and is your brother William?

27:21.020 --> 27:23.180
Yes, yes...

27:26.246 --> 27:27.594
How did you get on to me?

27:30.220 --> 27:32.180
The pivot for your false arm.

27:34.060 --> 27:36.190
I found it at the flat
at Shepherd's Market.

27:38.380 --> 27:40.661
You must have been in quite
a hurry, to leave that behind.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.609
You're the great detective.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.666
Do you deny killing your brother?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.277
How could I?

27:55.420 --> 27:56.784
I wouldn't have hurt your son.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.111
I just needed a way
to get you to listen,

28:01.509 --> 28:02.669
so you'd help us.

28:05.660 --> 28:08.315
And all everyone told me was
that you were incorruptible.

28:08.340 --> 28:09.875
For the purposes of this interview,

28:09.900 --> 28:12.020
we're only concerned with
the killing of your brother.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.081
Has anyone got a cigarette?

28:20.980 --> 28:22.180
I have some.

28:23.940 --> 28:26.155
What do you prefer, Superintendent?

28:26.980 --> 28:29.940
I have French, Turkish, American...

28:31.700 --> 28:34.123
It's been a long time since I tasted
a French cigarette.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.522
I'll need you to make
your confession in writing.

28:49.587 --> 28:51.267
Do you permit the prisoner to smoke?

29:13.620 --> 29:14.755
Why did you do it?

29:16.820 --> 29:19.753
You have your confession...
isn't that enough?

29:26.768 --> 29:29.166
This is the best cigarette
I've tasted in an age.

29:31.851 --> 29:34.379
Won't find anything like this
in prison, I expect.

29:40.740 --> 29:45.527
It's not my job to chase
Resistance fighters.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.027
You lost your arm taking on a Panzer...

29:52.957 --> 29:54.135
a friend of mine told me.

29:55.599 --> 29:57.005
Were you in the fighting too?

29:58.822 --> 29:59.822
No.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.004
You didn't miss anything.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.071
It was all over before it began.

30:06.412 --> 30:08.915
Only a bloody fool tries to jam
the sprocket wheel of a Mark IV

30:08.940 --> 30:09.990
with a tyre lever.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.319
He went past me without even noticing...

30:13.460 --> 30:14.980
and took my arm with him.

30:20.740 --> 30:23.377
You being there wouldn't have made
much difference, Superintendent,

30:23.401 --> 30:24.401
believe me.

30:28.163 --> 30:32.225
Is it a confession you wanted,
or absolution?

30:34.837 --> 30:36.183
Understanding.

30:39.157 --> 30:42.546
Your brother had his corneas
burned by radiation.

30:47.824 --> 30:49.150
Was he dying?

30:51.100 --> 30:52.886
So, you put him out of his misery.

30:53.932 --> 30:56.572
But why did you leave the pivot
from your elbow behind?

31:00.740 --> 31:02.660
Erm, d-do you have it with you?

31:21.980 --> 31:23.476
You found this in the room?

31:27.776 --> 31:28.933
Yes.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.755
Spode.

31:39.780 --> 31:40.884
Spode?

31:42.140 --> 31:44.195
Jesus.

31:44.220 --> 31:45.995
Get him some water!
Your medical section!

31:46.020 --> 31:47.275
He needs cardiac stimulants.

31:50.144 --> 31:51.731
Cyanide capsules.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.804
I have seen it on a man
straight after Armistice.

31:56.085 --> 31:57.437
I should have searched him.

32:02.699 --> 32:03.912
What do you care?

32:06.340 --> 32:10.515
Like he said, you have
got your confession.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.540
You can close the file now, can't you?

32:17.340 --> 32:20.757
You just stood there
and watched him, you stupid pig.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.285
And this half-witted army officer,
Hesse, watched too?

32:24.801 --> 32:25.843
Yes.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.435
<i>Any chance that
he passed him the capsule?</i>

32:30.460 --> 32:31.490
No, sir.

32:33.420 --> 32:34.995
<i>So from the moment you arrested Spode,</i>

32:35.020 --> 32:37.435
<i>was there even the briefest
opportunity for this damned</i>

32:37.460 --> 32:39.779
<i>army officer, Hesse, to pass him
anything at all?</i>

32:42.100 --> 32:43.275
No chance at all, sir.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.275
If we get this one wrong,
Superintendent Archer,

32:46.300 --> 32:47.885
you'll find yourself in Dachau.

32:48.780 --> 32:50.155
Do you know what Dachau is?

32:50.180 --> 32:51.713
I've heard the rumours, sir.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.021
<i>They are all true, believe me.</i>

33:10.460 --> 33:12.100
Canonbury 7946.

33:14.425 --> 33:15.520
Harry...

33:15.608 --> 33:18.115
<i>Look, Dougie, I heard
about the Tube attack.</i>

33:18.140 --> 33:19.315
<i>- Yeah?
- I should've...</i>

33:19.340 --> 33:21.497
Don't worry, it wasn't your fault.
I'm fine.

33:22.820 --> 33:26.628
Look, I want you to check on
an army artillery officer,

33:27.171 --> 33:28.754
Captain Hesse.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.681
Find out all you can.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.435
Call me back in 15 minutes.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.955
<i>Right you are. At Wittenham?</i>

33:34.980 --> 33:35.980
All right.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.275
Yeah?

34:13.302 --> 34:15.077
Yeah, I checked with
the boys at Hendon...

34:15.179 --> 34:17.275
Hesse is Army Intelligence.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.599
But why would they want
to keep a man down there?

34:19.820 --> 34:22.172
<i>I don't know, but I'm going to find out.</i>

34:22.668 --> 34:23.710
All right, thanks.

36:05.258 --> 36:06.618
Hello, handsome.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.699
I want to speak with Captain Hesse.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.479
Superintendent Archer,
you'd better come in.

36:36.116 --> 36:37.613
It's all right, he's one of mine.

36:40.420 --> 36:42.751
Colonel Mayhew, what a surprise!

36:43.020 --> 36:44.573
How the devil did you find this place?

36:48.780 --> 36:51.715
Captain Hesse here doesn't check
his rear-view mirror quite as often

36:51.740 --> 36:54.428
as one would imagine a man who
just committed murder might.

36:56.432 --> 36:58.378
He gave Spode a cyanide cigarette.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.562
What's this?

37:00.340 --> 37:01.475
You're imagining things.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.740
I have the cigarette.

37:04.051 --> 37:06.915
It seems it was more important
to the Army that Spode be silenced

37:06.940 --> 37:09.010
than let him to fall into
the hands of the SS.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.008
What were you afraid he'd tell them?

37:13.140 --> 37:15.396
Archer. Archer!

37:16.743 --> 37:18.555
We have more important
matters at hand here.

37:18.580 --> 37:19.970
More important than murder?

37:22.500 --> 37:24.395
What exactly are you doing here?

37:29.979 --> 37:31.229
Hesse...

37:41.165 --> 37:42.306
Well?

37:43.780 --> 37:46.215
These men are all
German Army Intelligence, yes?

37:48.060 --> 37:49.260
What the hell's going on?

37:54.540 --> 37:56.709
Miss Barga tells me
that I should trust you,

37:58.207 --> 37:59.702
but I'm not sure that I can.

38:02.409 --> 38:04.052
You haven't answered my question.

38:04.660 --> 38:07.643
What the hell are you doing here
with German Army Intelligence?

38:09.220 --> 38:10.507
We're in talks.

38:11.269 --> 38:12.284
Talks?

38:12.310 --> 38:13.444
About His Majesty.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.235
The fact is that some of them
feel it's incompatible with

38:16.260 --> 38:18.756
the honour of the German Army
that the King of England should be

38:18.780 --> 38:20.997
in custody, guarded by SS units.

38:21.820 --> 38:24.647
I know, old-fashioned buggers,
aren't they?

38:24.734 --> 38:25.791
More's our luck.

38:28.542 --> 38:31.035
Remember our conversation
about Rear Admiral Connolly,

38:31.060 --> 38:32.373
over there in Washington?

38:33.460 --> 38:37.035
If the King were free, and able to
confirm publicly Connolly's rank

38:37.060 --> 38:39.988
and position, it would transform
Britain's position in the world.

38:41.380 --> 38:42.980
You're not seriously suggesting

38:43.362 --> 38:45.716
that the German Army are going
to try and help free the King?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.955
A certain few will do
everything they can to help,

38:47.980 --> 38:49.438
save getting into a fight.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.811
What do they get out of it?

38:52.420 --> 38:55.595
The escape of the King from
SS custody would disgrace the SS

38:55.620 --> 38:57.635
and consolidate the Army's
Commander-in-Chief

38:57.660 --> 38:59.252
in his position of power here,

38:59.980 --> 39:01.355
and not just here...

39:01.900 --> 39:04.206
the repercussions would be felt
all the way to Berlin.

39:04.580 --> 39:06.861
We have the support of
the general staff in this business.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.559
What's the catch?

39:16.663 --> 39:18.437
The General will see you both now.

39:46.828 --> 39:49.893
So, the younger Spode is dead too?

39:50.140 --> 39:51.416
As I understand it, yes.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.635
And your police officer
followed Captain Hesse here?

39:54.660 --> 39:55.660
That's right.

39:56.540 --> 39:57.934
I will come to you later.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.940
Now, you listen to me, Major.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.075
If you want my co-operation,

40:06.580 --> 40:08.362
you're going to have to woo me,

40:10.300 --> 40:11.835
and I'm very difficult to please.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.436
You have the impertinent manner
of the revolutionary.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.115
It will get you nowhere.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.355
Let me remind you of your position...

40:19.380 --> 40:21.583
No. Let me remind you of your position.

40:46.140 --> 40:48.153
If there's any explaining to be done,

40:49.500 --> 40:50.619
then you'll do it.

40:54.940 --> 40:57.315
You're playing a dangerous game,
Superintendent.

40:57.340 --> 40:59.510
Not nearly as dangerous
as the one you're playing.

40:59.820 --> 41:03.172
If I submit a full report about
young Spode's murder this afternoon,

41:03.774 --> 41:05.949
the German C-in-C of Great Britain

41:06.410 --> 41:09.521
will likely find it very healthy
to distance himself from you,

41:09.780 --> 41:11.715
as will your colleagues in Berlin.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.380
You're not out of here yet.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.637
My car is equipped with
a radio telegraph.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.635
I wouldn't come into
a notorious district like this,

41:21.660 --> 41:23.720
late at night,
without taking precautions.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.580
What have you said?

41:31.830 --> 41:33.390
Nothing that can't be unsaid.

41:37.540 --> 41:42.420
Congratulations on apprehending
Dr. Spode's killer, Superintendent.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.808
Well, he was denied a trial,

41:48.189 --> 41:49.760
so we'll never really know, will we?

41:51.300 --> 41:53.795
Did he make a copy of
the calculations his brother

41:53.820 --> 41:55.675
stole from Bringle Sands?

41:56.460 --> 41:57.572
I asked him.

41:58.223 --> 41:59.318
He denied it.

41:59.891 --> 42:01.051
Did you believe him?

42:08.300 --> 42:11.155
In that case, I will hold you
personally responsible

42:11.180 --> 42:13.220
if a copy falls into the wrong hands.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.038
I had a feeling you'd say
something like that.

42:19.380 --> 42:24.275
Captain Hesse must not be included
in any reports to your authorities,

42:24.300 --> 42:27.660
or the King has no chance of freedom.

42:38.979 --> 42:40.219
Well, Archer?

42:45.260 --> 42:46.398
Very well.

42:46.660 --> 42:47.660
Good.

42:48.420 --> 42:51.235
I'll need to know how you would
dispose of His Majesty.

42:51.260 --> 42:54.435
Our honour requires that
his safety be assured.

42:54.460 --> 42:56.593
We'll fly him out of a disused airfield.

42:56.700 --> 42:59.065
Your staff are advising us
on which one to choose, sir.

42:59.420 --> 43:00.638
Will you go too?

43:00.740 --> 43:02.049
I've no orders as yet, sir.

43:02.103 --> 43:06.460
If we do decide to proceed,
be ready to move fast.

43:09.957 --> 43:11.070
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

43:30.140 --> 43:33.109
An aeroplane flying out
of a disused airfield?

43:34.648 --> 43:36.556
Now, was that just for the Huns,
or is that really the best way

43:36.580 --> 43:38.476
we've got of getting the King
out of the country?

43:38.500 --> 43:39.630
Have you got a better idea?

43:42.020 --> 43:43.835
Ship him out as diplomatic mail.

43:45.900 --> 43:47.900
You're a political innocent, Archer.

43:50.460 --> 43:51.859
Forged documents, then...

43:53.335 --> 43:56.116
ones that would make the Germans think
he was a diplomatic consignment.

43:56.140 --> 43:57.100
Worse.

43:57.126 --> 43:59.555
The escape of the King will be in
every history book ever written.

43:59.579 --> 44:01.815
Do you want it recorded that
the only way we could get him out

44:01.839 --> 44:04.466
of the country was by forging
the signature of a foreigner?

44:06.201 --> 44:08.316
The same reason we can't have him
do anything ridiculous,

44:08.340 --> 44:09.955
like dress up as a chambermaid,

44:09.980 --> 44:13.635
or pretend to be a German
lavatory attendant.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.163
You operate in a very
strange world, Colonel.

44:19.620 --> 44:21.300
You have no idea.

44:26.832 --> 44:28.112
Goodnight, Archer.

45:30.689 --> 45:32.829
A swordstick? It's so British.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.780
It was worse than that...
it was an umbrella-stick.

45:36.420 --> 45:38.057
I'm glad you didn't die that way.

45:38.740 --> 45:39.780
Me too.

45:41.644 --> 45:43.635
And thanks for nursing my ear.

45:43.660 --> 45:46.260
It's the least I could do.

45:52.143 --> 45:53.780
No feeling, sadly.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.700
You won't get me that way.

45:57.060 --> 45:59.755
Isn't the way to an Englishman's
heart through his lobes?

46:17.081 --> 46:18.782
Do you think he killed his own brother?

46:25.109 --> 46:29.469
I didn't know him long enough
to really decide.

46:31.999 --> 46:33.460
Both brothers dead...

46:35.540 --> 46:37.121
You knew the Spodes, didn't you?

46:46.831 --> 46:48.479
You met them before the war,

46:49.260 --> 46:52.244
when you were writing an article
on Professor Frick and his work,

46:54.820 --> 46:58.275
and I assume one of them contacted
you with the plan to get

46:58.300 --> 47:00.828
the atomic calculations into
American hands,

47:02.909 --> 47:05.589
and that's what you were doing,
coming to collect the film that day.

47:07.646 --> 47:09.099
You're very clever,

47:10.300 --> 47:13.591
though you seemed to have confused
interrogation with seduction.

47:17.740 --> 47:20.226
I hope you're not saying I had
anything to do with the murder?

47:21.245 --> 47:23.045
I'd still like to seduce you...

47:24.940 --> 47:26.262
but I want to know.

47:33.180 --> 47:34.210
Yes. You're right.

47:34.532 --> 47:36.869
I interviewed the older one
for the piece on Frick.

47:36.990 --> 47:38.165
He remembered me.

47:38.191 --> 47:39.391
I'm not surprised.

47:40.940 --> 47:44.326
I asked Bernard Staines about
the Spodes before I came out here.

47:44.702 --> 47:46.695
Suddenly, I'm up to my neck
in the Resistance.

47:48.300 --> 47:51.023
Yeah, things have been going
pretty fast for the two of us.

47:52.460 --> 47:56.980
In the last 48 hours,
I've lost one man, killed another...

47:58.900 --> 48:01.020
Made love to me for the first time.

48:02.388 --> 48:03.757
How can I forget?

48:08.776 --> 48:10.044
You seem different.

48:10.638 --> 48:11.724
Maybe I am.

48:12.412 --> 48:13.558
I like you more.

48:14.917 --> 48:16.362
Is the interrogation over?

48:24.068 --> 48:25.667
Just one last thing.

48:30.460 --> 48:33.315
You know, someone on that
inaugural flight from New York

48:33.340 --> 48:34.608
did a bit of smuggling.

48:34.940 --> 48:36.110
Really?

48:40.477 --> 48:42.204
Now, a hatbox like this

48:44.362 --> 48:47.000
would be perfect for
hiding away a newsreel.

48:50.980 --> 48:54.180
You seem to be more interested
in false bottoms than real ones.

48:55.545 --> 48:56.677
Well...

48:58.052 --> 48:59.722
we can't have that, can we?

49:08.420 --> 49:11.300
This ceremony tomorrow is
going to be bloody tedious.

49:12.780 --> 49:16.036
Apparently, the Russians are even
more long-winded than the Jerries.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.835
I assume you're a guest of honour,
darling.

49:23.174 --> 49:25.835
Disinterring Karl Marx and
mailing him back to Moscow

49:25.860 --> 49:26.905
is quite the story,

49:28.300 --> 49:30.807
but I'm sick of peddling
their propaganda.

49:38.340 --> 49:40.058
Let's find excuses.

49:40.934 --> 49:42.572
We could have a morning together.

49:53.134 --> 49:54.395
I can't.

50:14.247 --> 50:16.835
So you were all ready to pass on
the atomic plans to somebody

50:16.860 --> 50:18.007
at the American Embassy?

50:22.404 --> 50:23.444
Does it matter?

50:25.476 --> 50:26.756
Yes, it does.

50:29.140 --> 50:32.215
The guy I knew and trusted at
the embassy just moved back home,

50:32.977 --> 50:35.872
so I was going to have
to play it by ear.

50:35.959 --> 50:39.359
Ha! You have an answer
for everything, don't you?

50:41.328 --> 50:45.325
It only seems that way because you
never stop asking me questions.

50:52.660 --> 50:54.220
I'm not a spy, Douglas.

50:56.660 --> 50:58.700
I hear people lie to me all the time.

51:01.300 --> 51:03.486
So you can tell when
I'm telling the truth?

51:04.820 --> 51:06.235
You are cleverer than most.

51:12.260 --> 51:13.922
And that's why you like me.

51:14.740 --> 51:16.482
Well, that's one of the reasons.

51:23.620 --> 51:27.795
Have you heard anything
about a plot to free the King

51:27.820 --> 51:29.220
and take him to America?

51:32.046 --> 51:33.306
Maybe I have,

51:34.932 --> 51:36.648
but I don't give it much credence.

51:38.380 --> 51:39.971
Or, at least, the American part.

51:41.670 --> 51:42.670
Why not?

51:45.188 --> 51:48.468
Because your King would be
a liability to America.

51:51.420 --> 51:54.315
Do you think Roosevelt wants to
go into the schoolbooks as the man

51:54.340 --> 51:56.894
who invited the King of England
back to the US of A?

51:58.460 --> 52:02.995
Don't go thinking Roosevelt is
some kind of fanatical Anglophile.

52:03.577 --> 52:07.180
He's a politician, and back home,
that means a wily bird.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.028
Well, of course,
it's politically sensitive.

52:12.140 --> 52:13.718
Politically, it's suicide.

52:14.140 --> 52:16.875
Every politician is promising
he won't get American boys

52:16.900 --> 52:18.424
into a foreign war.

52:19.500 --> 52:21.624
Do you think anyone's going
to invite your King there,

52:21.940 --> 52:24.736
when he's the focal point of
the whole European wrangle?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.034
Wrangle?

52:31.220 --> 52:32.635
Over here, we call it war.

52:32.660 --> 52:34.195
You can call it anything you like,

52:34.220 --> 52:36.769
but for most people back home,
it's in the past tense.

52:37.540 --> 52:40.353
And the Germans...
they changed the tense.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.255
Sorry, Doug.

52:59.460 --> 53:01.231
I needed to know where you stood.

53:02.541 --> 53:03.770
Did it work?

53:22.242 --> 53:24.020
I wasn't just joking around.

53:25.740 --> 53:28.557
It's not going to be easy
to draw America into the war.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.035
No.

53:35.349 --> 53:37.084
But with those calculations...

53:40.411 --> 53:41.879
they might have woken them up.

53:45.474 --> 53:46.900
I guess we'll never know.

53:57.060 --> 53:58.318
Hello, Arthur.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.420
Hello, Superintendent.

54:06.340 --> 54:08.215
Any special instructions?

54:08.300 --> 54:10.523
Over or under development?

54:10.740 --> 54:14.300
The only special instruction is
keep your mouth shut about it.

54:15.592 --> 54:16.627
Righto.

54:16.925 --> 54:18.152
Good man. Thanks.

54:29.368 --> 54:30.489
Archer!

54:31.474 --> 54:32.772
General Kellermann.

54:34.960 --> 54:39.645
Molotov, Von Ribbentrop
and Goebbels. What a trio!

54:40.264 --> 54:42.344
Putting all your eggs
in the basket, yes?

54:44.460 --> 54:46.355
But after the Mall incident,

54:46.380 --> 54:49.690
I am sure the army will be keeping
a tighter watch.

54:54.044 --> 54:55.700
Hauptsturmfuhrer Schroder.

56:29.940 --> 56:32.395
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

56:45.532 --> 56:47.315
You're going to go
to the unoccupied zone.

56:47.340 --> 56:48.515
You'll be safer there.

56:50.860 --> 56:53.725
- It's starting.
- What is?

56:57.340 --> 56:58.355
The crackdown.

56:58.380 --> 57:02.515
Do you want to stay with me, Archer,
on my personal staff?

57:03.298 --> 57:05.243
You can come all the way to the top.

57:06.740 --> 57:09.488
Harry Woods didn't turn up for
a meeting with the Crime Super.

57:09.780 --> 57:11.525
You don't think
he could've been picked up?

57:11.752 --> 57:13.478
They're arresting thousands

57:13.658 --> 57:15.955
and drafting in interrogators
from everywhere.

57:15.980 --> 57:18.475
The Germans seem damn close
to producing an atomic bomb.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.915
We have no option but to go in
and raid Bringle Sands.

57:20.940 --> 57:23.155
Still, we can sabotage the rest.

57:23.180 --> 57:25.660
You want me to get the King
to Bringle Sands?

57:25.661 --> 57:25.761
