09:37.000 --> 09:38.834
A HUSBAND/WIFE
SOFTBALL GAME,

09:38.834 --> 09:40.367
BELIEVE ME,
I'D BE THERE.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.400
BUT IT'S NOT,
THANK GOD.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
IT'S A FATHER/SON GAME.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.834
LOOK, WE'RE JUST
ASKING YOU

09:45.834 --> 09:48.700
TO GET US
OFF THE HOOK.

09:48.700 --> 09:49.934
NO. THIS IS YOUR HOOK,

09:49.934 --> 09:54.700
AND YOU'RE GONNA HANG ON IT
LIKE THE WORMS YOU ARE.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.967
MOM, YOU'RE NOT
WALKING OUT ON US

09:56.967 --> 09:58.100
FOR GOOD, ARE YOU?

09:58.100 --> 10:00.400
I'M GOING TO THE BANK.
YOUR HEARTLESS FATHER

10:00.400 --> 10:02.467
ASKED ME TO DEPOSIT
HIS PAYCHECK

10:02.467 --> 10:05.033
SO WE COULD PAY THE BILLS.
OH, THE NERVE.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.400
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.567
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:07.567 --> 10:09.500
NO, HONEY. THERE'S
LONG LINES AT THE BANK,

10:09.500 --> 10:10.700
AND THERE'S
NO PLACE TO SIT.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.867
IT'D BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME
AND MORE FUN FOR YOU

10:12.867 --> 10:15.600
IF YOU STAYED HERE
AND PLAYED WITH YOUR TOYS.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.934
I'M GOING TO
THE BANK WITH MOMMY.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.767
OK, ERIC.
YOU'RE OLDER.

10:23.767 --> 10:25.934
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO GET US OUT OF THIS.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.700
I CAN DO IT.
I KNOW YOU CAN.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
I'VE GOT IT.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.767
I KNEW YOU COULD!

10:29.767 --> 10:31.600
LOOK, IT'S THE
FATHER/SON GAME, RIGHT?

10:31.600 --> 10:34.000
NOT THE FATHER/SONS
GAME.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
A LOOPHOLE.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.867
ONLY ONE OF US
HAS TO GO.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.100
RING, RING.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.100
HELLO?

10:40.100 --> 10:42.667
IT'S THE GOVERNOR.
WE'RE SAVED!

10:42.667 --> 10:43.667
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

10:43.667 --> 10:45.367
YES, I AM. HEY,
GOOD LUCK AT THE GAME.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.734
REMEMBER,
WHEN ALL DAD'S FRIENDS

10:46.734 --> 10:49.133
GO UP AND TOUSLE YOUR HAIR
AND CALL YOU "TIGER,"

10:49.133 --> 10:52.200
HERE'S WHAT A SINCERE
SMILE LOOKS LIKE.

10:55.033 --> 10:58.133
TIME OUT, TOOTH BOY.
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO?

10:58.133 --> 10:59.300
LOOK, CORY, I'D GO,

10:59.300 --> 11:01.500
BUT WHAT IF DAD AND I
STARTED TALKING ABOUT GOLF,

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
TALKED ABOUT HOW SOMEONE
BROKE HIS DRIVER

11:03.500 --> 11:05.367
IN THE BACKYARD
HITTIN' ROCKS WITH IT?

11:05.367 --> 11:06.467
YOU WOULDN'T.
I WOULD.

11:06.467 --> 11:07.467
YOU WOULDN'T.
I WOULD.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.600
OK, FINE.
I'M GONNA GO.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.300
BUT WAIT. WHAT IF DAD
STARTS JOKING AROUND

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
ABOUT HOW NERVOUS HE IS
THAT YOU'RE GETTING

11:14.200 --> 11:15.834
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE
NEXT YEAR?

11:15.834 --> 11:17.300
I'D HAVE TO CALM
HIM DOWN BY SAYING

11:17.300 --> 11:19.000
"ERIC'S DRIVEN YOUR CAR
AROUND THE BLOCK

11:19.000 --> 11:21.033
1,000 TIMES, AND NOTHING
HAS EVER HAPPENED."

11:21.033 --> 11:22.100
YOU WOULDN'T.
I WOULD.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.300
YOU WOULDN'T.
I WOULD.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
YOU WOULDN'T.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.867
WHAT ARE YOU, NEW?

11:26.867 --> 11:27.934
LOOK,
I'M NOT GOING.

11:27.934 --> 11:28.967
WELL,
I'M NOT, EITHER.

11:28.967 --> 11:30.100
I GUESS
THE ONLY FAIR WAY

11:30.100 --> 11:31.100
IS TO LET DAD DECIDE.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
FINE.
FINE.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.133
MAY THE BEST
EXCUSE WIN.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.300
DAD!
DAD!

11:35.300 --> 11:38.700
[BOTH SHOUTING AT ONCE]

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
HEY, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.734
START ALL OVER AGAIN...
THIS TIME IN ENGLISH.

11:43.734 --> 11:46.133
[BOTH TALKING AT ONCE]

11:46.133 --> 11:48.000
WHOA, WHOA.
NO, TRY AGAIN.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.233
ONE AT A TIME.
YOU FIRST.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.200
LOOK, DAD, I CAN'T PLAY IN
THE SOFTBALL GAME TOMORROW.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.767
SEE, VICKI AND I HAVE THIS
REALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT

11:54.767 --> 11:56.200
DUE NEXT WEEK,
AND, WELL, WE'VE HAD

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
THIS STUDY DATE PLANNED
SINCE, LIKE, 1942--

11:58.800 --> 12:01.367
WHAT SUBJECT?
SCIENCE.

12:01.367 --> 12:02.600
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE SAME CLASS.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.000
WE HAVE
IDENTICAL PROJECTS

12:04.000 --> 12:05.233
DUE ON THE SAME DAY, OK?

12:05.233 --> 12:06.734
OH, AMAZING
COINCIDENCE.

12:06.734 --> 12:07.967
ISN'T IT?
LOOK, ANYWAY,

12:07.967 --> 12:10.300
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET HER
AT THE LIBRARY TOMORROW--

12:10.300 --> 12:11.367
MEET HER ON SUNDAY.

12:11.367 --> 12:12.567
THE LIBRARY'S
CLOSED SUNDAY.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.300
NOT ANYMORE.
THEY CHANGED THE HOURS.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.934
GUYS, I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.700
DAD, UNBELIEVABLY,
MY LEFT LEG

12:17.700 --> 12:19.500
HAS TO BE TESTED
FOR RADON TOMORROW.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.567
I JUST GOT
A PHONE CALL.

12:21.567 --> 12:22.800
YEAH,
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

12:22.800 --> 12:25.133
BUT I'M THE LAST GUY
TO ENDANGER MY FAMILY,

12:25.133 --> 12:26.367
AND THE TESTING'S FREE.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.367
THE GAME
HAS BEEN CANCELED.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.233
AND I TOLD THEM,
"TAKE THE LEG OFF,

12:30.233 --> 12:31.233
"BECAUSE, DARN IT,

12:31.233 --> 12:34.500
I GOT A SOFTBALL GAME
WITH MY DAD!"

12:34.500 --> 12:37.600
THEY COULDN'T GENERATE
ENOUGH INTEREST.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
THAT STINKS.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.600
YEAH, I WAS PSYCHED.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.867
AH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

12:40.867 --> 12:43.900
THERE'LL BE
OTHER GAMES.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.000
HEY, IS THE LIBRARY
REALLY OPEN ON SUNDAY?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.400
HOW DO I KNOW?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
NOT BAD.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.233
SO, HOW WAS
YOUR WEEKEND?

12:58.233 --> 13:00.500
AH, ONE OF
THE ALL-TIME GREATS.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.000
I SLEPT IN,
I WATCHED TV,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.400
I RELAXED,
I PLAYED VIDEO GAMES.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.233
AND SUNDAY,
I TOOK IT EASY.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.600
HI, CORY.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.133
HEY, LOOK WHO JUST
BEAMED DOWN.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.300
HI, TOPANGA.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.500
I MISSED YOU
AT THE GAME SATURDAY.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.500
WHAT GAME?

13:16.500 --> 13:17.834
YOUR FATHER'S
GROCERY STORE

13:17.834 --> 13:19.233
AGAINST MY FATHER'S
BOOKSTORE.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.500
UH, TOPANGA,
IN THIS DIMENSION,

13:21.500 --> 13:22.867
THERE WAS NO GAME.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.834
YES, THERE WAS.
I PLAYED.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.467
TOPANGA,
THAT GAME WAS CANCELED.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.567
YOU WISH.
WE WERE KILLING YOU

13:29.567 --> 13:31.133
UNTIL YOUR FATHER'S
ASSISTANT MANAGER

13:31.133 --> 13:33.567
TRIED TO THROW THE BALL HOME
FROM CENTER FIELD

13:33.567 --> 13:34.700
AND SPRAINED
HIS ELBOW.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.200
THE AMBULANCE HAD TO COME
AND TAKE HIM AWAY.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.500
THERE'S ALWAYS
AN AMBULANCE.

13:39.500 --> 13:43.667
MY FATHER TOLD ME
THAT GAME WAS CALLED OFF.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.000
WELL, IT WASN'T.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.400
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
MAYBE YOUR DAD

13:48.400 --> 13:49.800
JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE PLAYING.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.233
MAYBE HE DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE PLAYING ALONE.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.867
[MUSIC PLAYING]

13:59.233 --> 14:01.200
[SIGHS] OK.
I'M HERE. WHAT?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.400
MOM,
THIS IS BAD.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.400
LOOK, THERE WAS

14:03.400 --> 14:05.367
A FATHER/SON SOFTBALL
GAME ON SATURDAY.

14:05.367 --> 14:06.834
OH, SHOCKER.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.400
YOU KNOW?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.467
SHE KNOWS.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.233
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY'D DAD TELL US

14:11.233 --> 14:12.934
THE GAME
WAS CANCELED?

14:12.934 --> 14:13.934
GEE, GUYS, I'M NOT SURE.

14:13.934 --> 14:15.400
DID YOU GIVE HIM
ANY INDICATION

14:15.400 --> 14:16.800
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO PLAY?

14:16.800 --> 14:18.200
NO WAY.
NO WAY.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.867
WE WERE
COMPLETELY COOL.

14:19.867 --> 14:20.934
COMPLETELY COOL.

14:20.934 --> 14:21.934
HE KNEW IMMEDIATELY.

14:21.934 --> 14:22.934
HE KNOWS
EVERYTHING.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.767
OBVIOUSLY HE PICKED UP
ON THE FACT

14:24.767 --> 14:25.934
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO PLAY

14:25.934 --> 14:28.200
AND HE'S THE ONE
WHO LET YOU OFF THE HOOK.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.567
WORMS.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.567
WE'RE WORMS.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.400
WE MADE OUR FATHER
FEEL BAD.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.467
MOM, CAN YOU
GET US OUT OF THIS?

14:34.467 --> 14:36.367
YOU KNOW,
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE?

14:36.367 --> 14:37.400
HMM. CAN'T.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
THE FAT LADY HAS SUNG
AND GONE HOME.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.900
SHE'S IN HER KITCHEN
EATING CHEESECAKE.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.033
COME ON, MOM.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.967
WE MADE OUR FATHER
FEEL BAD.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.734
WELL, HE'S A BIG BOY.
HE'LL GET OVER IT,

14:47.734 --> 14:50.000
BUT HOPEFULLY YOU GUYS
LEARNED SOMETHING

14:50.000 --> 14:51.233
FOR THE NEXT TIME.

14:51.233 --> 14:53.100
I HAVE.
I REALLY HAVE.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.867
GOOD. THEN YOU
GET OVER IT, TOO.

14:55.867 --> 14:58.600
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.100
I'LL NEVER GET OVER IT.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.367
DAD REALLY WANTED TO PLAY,
AND HE KNEW WE DIDN'T,

15:02.367 --> 15:03.934
SO HE DUMPED
THE GAME FOR US.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.367
IT'S LIKE
<i>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI, </i>

15:06.367 --> 15:09.133
EXCEPT WE DIDN'T
GET HIM ANYTHING.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.400
ARE WE BAD SONS, ERIC?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.100
RIGHT NOW WE ARE.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.800
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.500
I HAVE APPENDICITIS.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.200
THAT'S NOT
YOUR APPENDIX,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.400
THAT'S YOUR HEART.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.500
I HAVE AHEARTICITIS.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.567
[BANGING]

15:31.100 --> 15:33.500
MR. MATTHEWS.
MR. MATTHEWS.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
LEONARD SPINELLI.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.667
I WORK
FOR YOUR FATHER

15:35.667 --> 15:36.767
DOWN AT
THE GROCERY STORE.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.100
WE KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, LENNY.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.300
WE'RE THE ONES
THAT CALLED YOU.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.300
YEAH, I KNOW.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.400
AND IT WAS
A RARE TREAT,

15:41.400 --> 15:43.400
BUT, SINCE YOU NEVER
CALLED ME BEFORE,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.100
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE
YOU ONE LAST CHANCE

15:45.100 --> 15:46.767
TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT
THE RIGHT GUY.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.967
DID YOU GET THE STUFF
WE ASKED YOU FOR?

15:48.967 --> 15:50.000
YES, I DID.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
THEN WE GOT
THE RIGHT GUY.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.200
OK, LET'S SEE.
GROUND CHUCK.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.967
HAMBURGER BUNS.

15:55.967 --> 15:58.100
YOU MAY BE WONDERING
HOW I SPRAINED MY ELBOW.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.200
LENNY, WE KNOW YOU GOT HURT
AT THE SOFTBALL GAME.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.367
WHAT GAME?

16:02.367 --> 16:03.734
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAME.

16:03.734 --> 16:08.400
I HURT MYSELF GETTING OUT
OF A TURTLENECK THAT SHRUNK.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.934
WE KNOW ABOUT
THE GAME, LENNY.

16:09.934 --> 16:12.867
JUST DON'T LET DAD KNOW
WE KNOW ABOUT THE GAME.

16:12.867 --> 16:13.867
YEAH.

16:13.867 --> 16:15.867
OH, BOY. OK, LET'S RECAP.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.734
YOUR FATHER SAYS
THERE WAS NO GAME,

16:17.734 --> 16:20.000
BUT KNOWS THERE WAS ONE.
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A GAME,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.967
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR FATHER TO KNOW YOU KNOW.

16:21.967 --> 16:24.200
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS--
DON'T YOU THINK HE KNOWS

16:24.200 --> 16:28.367
YOU KNOW HE KNOWS YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW HE KNOWS, YOU KNOW?

16:28.367 --> 16:31.867
YOU GOT TO EXCUSE ME,
I'M ON PAINKILLERS.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.667
ROOT BEER.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.033
PICKLES AND CHIPS.

16:35.033 --> 16:36.500
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE FIRST OCCASION

16:36.500 --> 16:38.667
I'VE EVER DONE MYSELF
PHYSICAL DAMAGE

16:38.667 --> 16:40.000
THAT I CAN REMEMBER.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
KETCHUP.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.867
OF COURSE, I CAN
REMEMBER MANY OCCASIONS

16:42.867 --> 16:46.233
WHEN I'VE DONE MYSELF
VAST EMOTIONAL DAMAGE.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.033
PIMENTO LOAF?

16:48.033 --> 16:49.400
DID WE ASK FOR THIS?

16:49.400 --> 16:50.767
NO, BUT I THREW
THAT IN

16:50.767 --> 16:52.233
'CAUSE I REALLY
LOVE IT.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.233
WHAT?

16:53.233 --> 16:54.300
NOW WE GOT
EVERYTHING WE NEED

16:54.300 --> 16:57.000
FOR THAT ALL-GUY
PARTY YOU DESCRIBED.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
LENNY--

16:58.000 --> 16:59.300
ABOUT THAT PARTY,
LENNY. SEE--

16:59.300 --> 17:01.467
VAST EMOTIONAL
DAMAGE.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.367
WE'D BE DELIGHTED
IF YOU COULD ATTEND.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.400
THANK YOU.
DELIGHTED TO BE HERE.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.400
I'LL GO TURN OFF MY CAR.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.100
IS THIS THE BEST TIME
YOU COULD EVER HAVE?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.500
JUST COOKING BURGERS
IN THE BACKYARD...

17:15.500 --> 17:16.734
DAD AND HIS BOYS...

17:16.734 --> 17:19.233
AND HIS DAD'S
ASSISTANT MANAGER.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.667
TIME OF MY LIFE.

17:20.667 --> 17:25.200
I'D APPLAUD,
BUT I'D PASS OUT.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.300
SALAD'S DONE.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.400
GOOD-LOOKING SALAD.
REAL MEN NEED A SALAD

17:31.400 --> 17:33.033
THEY CAN EAT
WITH THEIR HANDS.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.567
YEAH, YOU JUST
PICK IT UP

17:34.567 --> 17:36.300
AND DUNK IT
IN THE DRESSING.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.600
AH, NO DIRTY
DISHES...

17:37.600 --> 17:38.900
NO NAPKINS,
NO UTENSILS...

17:38.900 --> 17:42.400
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED,
WE JUST HOSE DOWN THE PORCH.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.567
MAN MEAL.
END OF STORY.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.734
BOY, YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

17:46.734 --> 17:48.233
SOMEDAY,
WHEN I HAVE A FAMILY,

17:48.233 --> 17:49.367
I'M GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.133
UNLESS MY WIFE DIVORCES ME
AND MY KIDS HATE ME

17:52.133 --> 17:53.600
BECAUSE SHE POISONED THEM
AGAINST ME

17:53.600 --> 17:55.800
AND I HAVE TO SEND
MY ENTIRE WEEKLY PAYCHECK

17:55.800 --> 17:57.667
TO SUPPORT
THE BLOOD-SUCKING LEECHES

17:57.667 --> 18:01.300
WHILE I LIVE
IN SQUALOR AND DESPAIR.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.600
DID I MENTION
I'M ON PAINKILLERS?

18:05.934 --> 18:07.567
ROOT BEERS ALL AROUND?

18:07.567 --> 18:09.400
OH, RIGHT.
WE'RE HAVING FUN NOW.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.934
YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME, DAD?

18:10.934 --> 18:13.000
HEY, GREAT.
WHAT COULD BE BETTER?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.900
YEAH. WHAT COULD
BE BETTER?

18:14.900 --> 18:15.900
YEAH.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.100
COULD I SEE YOU?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.000
YEAH.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.500
HE HATES IT.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.367
HE DOESN'T HATE IT.
HE'S HAVING A NICE TIME.

18:25.367 --> 18:26.767
NICE ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH, ERIC.

18:26.767 --> 18:29.500
REMEMBER HOW PSYCHED HE WAS
ABOUT THE SOFTBALL GAME?

18:29.500 --> 18:30.834
THAT WAS THE TIME
HE WANTED.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.767
HE WANTED ONE LOUSY
SOFTBALL GAME,

18:32.767 --> 18:34.100
AND WE DIDN'T
GIVE IT TO HIM.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.200
WE GAVE HIM DINNER.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.834
WE GAVE HIM
DINNER...

18:36.834 --> 18:38.367
WHICH HE'S
GIVEN US, WHAT,

18:38.367 --> 18:40.100
ONLY EVERY NIGHT
OF OUR LIVES.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.567
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
SUCH A BIG DEAL.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.500
I GUESS WE SHOULD'VE
JUST GIVEN HIM THE GAME.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.800
YEAH. WE SHOULD'VE JUST
STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE

18:47.800 --> 18:50.100
AND SAID, "I PLEDGE
ALLEGIANCE TO MY DAD,"

18:50.100 --> 18:52.300
AND SWUNG FOR THAT
GAME-WINNING HOME RUN.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.600
THINK THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN BETTER THAN TONIGHT?

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
HEY, YOU GUYS.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.000
COME OUT AND GET
SOME PIMENTO LOAF.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.667
I JUST NOTICED
THE EXPIRATION DATE.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.367
OH, YEAH.
MUCH BETTER THAN TONIGHT.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.934
ALL RIGHT, CLASS, WHEN WE WERE
LAST IN SOCIAL STUDIES,

19:09.934 --> 19:13.600
WE WERE ADDRESSING
THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL DISSENT.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.700
MISS LAWRENCE?

19:14.700 --> 19:17.500
I'VE THOUGHT OVER MY
POSITION, MR. FEENY.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.767
AND NOT ONLY
DO I NOT WANT

19:18.767 --> 19:20.100
TO SAY THE PLEDGE
OF ALLEGIANCE,

19:20.100 --> 19:23.200
BUT I ALSO DO NOT
WANT TO WEAR SHOES.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.600
WE WHO SIT
BEHIND YOU OBJECT.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.867
MR. MATTHEWS,

19:28.867 --> 19:31.033
YOU WERE A PRO-PLEDGER
AS I RECALL.

19:31.033 --> 19:33.734
YEAH, I WAS,
BUT I THOUGHT IT OVER.

19:33.734 --> 19:36.800
OH? YOU'VE CHANGED
YOUR POSITION?

19:36.800 --> 19:37.800
NO. I HAVEN'T,

19:37.800 --> 19:40.000
BUT I CAN ARGUE IT
BETTER NOW.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.900
REALLY? WELL, THEN,
THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.200
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD JUST SAY IT

19:51.200 --> 19:54.200
BECAUSE IT WAS A TRADITION,
AND IT'S THE FLAG,

19:54.200 --> 19:55.467
BUT NOW I THINK IT'S DUMB

19:55.467 --> 19:57.767
TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT KNOW
WHY YOU DO IT.

19:57.767 --> 20:01.300
AND WHAT CONCLUSION
HAS THAT LED YOU TO?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.600
THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CARE ABOUT,

20:03.600 --> 20:07.300
LIKE THE COUNTRY YOU LIVE IN
OR THE FATHER YOU HAVE,

20:07.300 --> 20:10.600
THEN ALLEGIANCE,
WHICH MEANS,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.500
"NOUN. LOYALTY OR DEVOTION
TO A GOVERNMENT

20:13.500 --> 20:15.567
OR A GROUP OR A PERSON."

20:15.567 --> 20:18.834
ALLEGIANCE IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD SHOW.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.500
SO, THEN YOU BELIEVE

20:20.500 --> 20:22.000
THAT YOU
SHOULD RESPECT

20:22.000 --> 20:24.300
THE TRADITIONS
OF THAT GOVERNMENT

20:24.300 --> 20:26.200
OR GROUP OR PERSON.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.300
YEAH. I SHOULD'VE.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.467
OR TEACHER?

20:29.467 --> 20:31.000
[BELL RINGS]

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
OR A TEACHER.

21:03.734 --> 21:05.400
WHY AREN'T
YOU GUYS ASLEEP?

21:05.400 --> 21:06.700
WE COULDN'T SLEEP, DAD.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.500
WE GOT SOMETHING
ON OUR MINDS.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.500
YEAH, AND IT'S REALLY
DRAGGING US DOWN.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.200
OH, COME ON, GUYS.
FORGET IT.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.967
YOU THREW ME
A BARBECUE.

21:13.967 --> 21:14.967
WE'RE EVEN.

21:14.967 --> 21:16.767
NO. WE'RE WAY PAST
THAT GUILT.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.233
WE NEVER FOUND OUT
THE SCORE

21:18.233 --> 21:20.100
OF THE FATHER/SON
SOFTBALL GAME.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.400
OH, WELL,
WE GOT CREAMED.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.467
18-3.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.767
YOU LET THOSE
SANDAL-WEARING,

21:25.767 --> 21:26.767
CRYSTAL-PACKING,

21:26.767 --> 21:28.367
BROWN RICE-EATING
VEG HEADS

21:28.367 --> 21:29.734
WALK ALL OVER YOU?

21:29.734 --> 21:31.700
[LAUGHS] HEY,
I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.600
WELL, WHOSE FAULT
IS THAT?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
YOURS.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.934
NO, IT ISN'T.

21:35.934 --> 21:36.934
OH, IT ISN'T?

21:36.934 --> 21:38.600
NO. BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY,

21:38.600 --> 21:41.000
IT'S THE SON'S PART OF
THE GAME TO NOT WANT TO GO.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.133
AND IT'S THE FATHER'S
PART OF THE GAME

21:43.133 --> 21:44.133
TO MAKE US GO.

21:44.133 --> 21:45.133
YOU DIDN'T MAKE US GO.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.133
YOU DIDN'T PLAY
THE GAME.

21:46.133 --> 21:48.200
YOU BROKE
THE TRADITION, DAD.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.200
AND I FIGURE
THAT'S WHY WE LOST.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.367
YOU DO?

21:51.367 --> 21:53.500
YEAH, BUT SEEING AS
WE'RE BUCKING TRADITION,

21:53.500 --> 21:55.200
WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT
A WHOLE YEAR

21:55.200 --> 21:56.700
TO PLAY ANOTHER
FATHER/SON GAME?

21:56.700 --> 21:58.400
YEAH. HOW ABOUT
WE CHALLENGE

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
THE UNICORN
RAINBOW BOOKSTORE

22:00.400 --> 22:03.467
TO ANOTHER GAME
RIGHT NOW?

22:04.700 --> 22:05.734
WELL, UH,

22:05.734 --> 22:07.900
I AM FREE
NEXT WEEKEND.

22:07.900 --> 22:08.900
SO ARE WE.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.800
NO MATTER
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.100
ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT A GAME.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.200
WE GOT A GAME.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.667
WE GOT A GAME.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.734
OH, DAD...
HMM?

22:19.734 --> 22:21.834
ON ONE CONDITION.
WHAT?

22:21.834 --> 22:24.200
LOSE THE DOLL.
YEAH.

22:32.734 --> 22:33.967
YES! VICTORY!

22:33.967 --> 22:37.000
CARNIVORES 36,
BRUSSELS SPROUTS 9.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.133
HUT HUT!

22:39.133 --> 22:41.600
AND HERE'S THE
GAME-WINNING FATHER NOW.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.400
GREAT SLIDE
INTO HOME, DAD.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.133
HEY, HIGH FIVE.

22:45.133 --> 22:46.133
ALL RIGHT.

22:46.133 --> 22:47.500
YEAH, THAT WAS
A GREAT GAME.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.900
I HAD A TERRIFIC TIME.
I CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.667
AH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.967
YEAH, THE BOOKSTORE
WANTS TO GO

22:53.967 --> 22:54.967
BEST 2 OUT OF 3.

22:54.967 --> 22:56.600
WE GOT A REMATCH
NEXT WEEK.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.600
HEY, THAT'S NICE.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.500
ISN'T THAT NICE?

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
