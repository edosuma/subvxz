00:01.543 --> 00:05.005
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:08.300
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:11.220
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:14.097
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:17.976
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.355
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.190
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.441
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:38.455
<i>And now the History Channel</i>
<i>presents</i> American Inventor,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.707
<i>the true story of Henry Ford.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:44.962
<i>This is my Jew-flattening machine.</i>
<i>It will flatten any Jew.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:48.340
<i>Simply climb behind the wheel,</i>
<i>drive it towards a Jew and flatten him.</i>

00:48.423 --> 00:51.301
<i>Could you also use it just to drive</i>
<i>from place to place and stuff?</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:54.137
<i>It's a Jew-flattening machine,</i>
<i>it's not what it's designed for.</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.765
<i>- But you could use it that way?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, you could...</i>

00:56.849 --> 01:00.018
<i>Yeah, you can also use the Mona Lisa</i>
<i>as a place mat. God!</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:02.187
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Quagmire.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.647
How was marching band practice?

01:03.856 --> 01:06.191
Peter, you know
this is a pilot's uniform.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.360
It represents years
of specialized training.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.029
Yeah, well, you know what else takes
years of specialized training?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.281
Crossing your eyes.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.327
-Too far! Too far!
- Hold still.

01:21.206 --> 01:25.419
Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.
You've earned your nickel this week.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.422
- Where you coming from, Quagmire?
- I had to fly to Aruba,

01:28.505 --> 01:31.258
so I brought my mom along
with my "friends and family" discount.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.886
- Did you...
- Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.306
Where do you even put
all those magnets, Joe?

01:37.389 --> 01:41.310
You know I have that fridge in the garage
with bags of blood in my blood type.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.563
What's "friends and family"?

01:44.771 --> 01:48.358
Oh, airline employees can get discounted
tickets for family and close friends.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.736
What? How come you've never
done that for us?

01:50.861 --> 01:54.239
If I'm being honest, I've also got
a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.742
I don't know. I guess I just figured
you guys always have to work

01:56.825 --> 01:59.745
or you're with your kids,
but sure, I could take you somewhere.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.914
I'm going to San Francisco next week.
You guys wanna come?

02:01.997 --> 02:03.332
San Francisco?

02:03.415 --> 02:06.335
That city from
<i>And the Band Played On</i> and <i>Milk?</i>

02:06.418 --> 02:08.629
- I'm in.
- Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.214
Oh, wow, this will be great.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.965
Hey, can you make us X-Men?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.638
What a surprise.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.645
Well, I'm off to San Francisco
with the guys.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.980
Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head
with the girls.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.065
You what?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
Peter, I told you about this
a month ago.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.570
I'm going with Bonnie and Donna
to Donna's sister's timeshare.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.073
We can't both go on a trip
at the same time.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.117
I'm sorry, Peter,
but I already have a taxi waiting.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.079
All right, I'll go tell the guys
I'm not going.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.957
Why is he taking his suitcase
to tell the guys?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.959
You guys, come on, we gotta go now!
Let's go, move it!

02:47.042 --> 02:48.168
I'm in the shower!

02:48.252 --> 02:49.962
It doesn't matter.
We're stealing Lois' cab.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.923
Son of a...

02:53.090 --> 02:54.967
And the idiot took my suitcase.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.596
Aw, he was taking me with him.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.939
Ah, San Francisco.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.358
San Francisco!

03:11.900 --> 03:14.862
- So what are we gonna do first?
- I wanna see the Golden Gate Bridge.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.031
- I wanna see Lombard Street.
- I wanna see Ghirardelli Square.

03:18.115 --> 03:22.077
Guys, guys, let's get lesbian haircuts
and see 'em all!

03:42.556 --> 03:45.642
All right, the gay jokes are out of
the way, now, let's get down to business.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.525
Okay, guys. "This is the original
Levi jeans factory

03:53.609 --> 03:56.904
"created by Levi Strauss
in the year 1853

03:56.987 --> 04:00.073
"so that gold miners could wear
a comfortable yet durable fabric."

04:00.157 --> 04:03.035
- This is boring.
- Well, then you plan the vacation!

04:03.160 --> 04:05.954
- Peter, Peter, calm down. It's okay.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.208
- We'll do whatever you want.
- All right, if you promise.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.585
I was thinking we could
tuck our shirts into our pants,

04:11.668 --> 04:13.837
put on huge helmets and ride Segways.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.132
We're not from here!
We're not from here!

04:20.552 --> 04:24.097
You guys, look, it's Golden State
Warriors star, Steph Curry.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.351
Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan!

04:27.434 --> 04:28.727
Thanks, it's nice to meet you.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.979
Hey, I know we just met
but can I sit on your lap

04:31.063 --> 04:33.190
during your next post-game
press conference?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.858
Sure. I don't see why not.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.110
This is exciting
for the whole Bay area

04:37.194 --> 04:39.321
to be just four games away
from the Championship.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.739
Dad, I duked.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
The other team's
not just gonna go away, though.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.077
We've gotta stay focused,
keep doing what we've been doing.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.621
Fat lady. Dad, Dad, a fat lady.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.331
Yeah, I see her, Peter.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.000
- Make her go.
- That's not how we talk to people.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.961
- Make her go!
- I'll leave.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.255
Yay! I'm learning bad lessons!

05:02.177 --> 05:04.596
Wow. So that was San Francisco.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
I didn't realize how hilly
it was gonna be.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.726
Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.812
Hey, no problem.
You know, we're here early.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.731
- You guys want a little tour of the plane?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.483
Normally, I just go to Hudson News

05:16.567 --> 05:18.652
and pretend to be
the most important guy there.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.070
Can I help you?

05:20.153 --> 05:24.241
Yes, I will have eight Dasanis
and a J.D. Power and Associates.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.874
Wow, this place is cool.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.586
Yeah, what do all these buttons do?
Like, what's this red one?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.838
That's a voice filter,
so the passengers always think

05:37.921 --> 05:40.591
the pilot is a 60-year-old
Midwestern white man.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.634
What? That's impossible.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.928
Hi, y'all. This is Cleveland.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.138
<i>Good afternoon, folks.</i>

05:46.221 --> 05:48.557
<i>This is Captain Darrell Clarke</i>
<i>up here on the flight deck.</i>

05:48.932 --> 05:50.851
We're way up in the air.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.021
<i>We've reached our cruising altitude</i>
<i>of 37,000 feet.</i>

05:54.313 --> 05:56.899
Y'all get ready to watch
<i>Big Momma's House.</i>

05:57.024 --> 06:00.694
<i>Our in-flight entertainment today</i>
<i>will be</i> Under the Tuscan Sun.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.487
- Oh, I like that.
- I hear it's good.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.199
Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?

06:05.282 --> 06:07.951
Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself
when I need a break.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.537
What do you mean "a break"?
You don't have to fly the plane?

06:10.621 --> 06:12.873
Of course, I do. I just take
a short break sometimes.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.876
"Short break"? It looks like you had
time to put together

06:15.959 --> 06:18.295
the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.048
You don't have to touch it, Joe.
You can just say you noticed it.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.635
- And what's this booth over here?
- Oh, that's my "back in time" box.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.054
I go inside,
magically go back in time,

06:27.137 --> 06:29.473
and then come out and react
to the fact that we're flying.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.769
My God, we're levitating!

06:33.977 --> 06:37.064
- That's just a box full of costumes.
- It's my "back in time" box!

06:37.314 --> 06:38.524
What the hell, Quagmire?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.817
So basically, your job
is just goofing off.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.028
- That's not true.
- I broke Gandalf in half.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.446
It's Dumbledore.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.740
Screw you guys!
You know, being a pilot is hard work.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.826
Look, I tried to be nice
and take you fellas on a free trip.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.120
And all you could do
is crap all over my job!

06:52.204 --> 06:55.791
I was a Navy Pilot, you jerks.
Get the hell out of my cockpit!

06:58.752 --> 07:01.421
Joke's on him. I farted
just before he kicked us out.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.965
Oh... Oh, God!

07:09.012 --> 07:11.098
All right, let's see what's in
the in-flight magazine.

07:11.682 --> 07:15.686
Muscular old guy,
already-filled-in crossword puzzle...

07:15.853 --> 07:18.146
Ooh, this is food
for different routes I'm not on.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.025
All right, time to use the potty.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.777
Don't say "potty." You're an adult.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.661
Okay, nobody move!

07:32.953 --> 07:35.873
Oh, my God,
those guys in first class have guns!

07:35.956 --> 07:38.917
Cleveland, just be happy with what
you have. Don't envy people.

07:39.001 --> 07:42.087
No, Peter, we're being hijacked.
Close the cockpit door!

07:46.508 --> 07:48.385
This plane now belongs to us.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.555
You move, you're dead.
So nobody try to get smart.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.058
Hmm, page 100. Hmm.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.150
Control tower, this is flight 364.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.819
We have a hijacking in progress.
Our flight has been...

08:07.112 --> 08:08.864
Damn it, they jammed the transmission.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.325
I'm gonna have to go
to the backup communication system.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.456
<i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

08:17.539 --> 08:20.083
<i>This is flight 364.</i>
<i>We're being hijacked.</i>

08:20.250 --> 08:21.543
I can hear you...

08:26.840 --> 08:30.511
This is your last chance.
Open the door or your copilot gets it.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.596
No! I'm landing
at the closest airfield

08:32.679 --> 08:34.389
which is less than an hour away.

08:34.473 --> 08:37.476
So just let him go, 'cause you're
not getting control of this plane!

08:39.144 --> 08:40.562
Jimmy! Oh, my God!

08:40.896 --> 08:42.189
Why are you doing this?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.815
America needs to be punished

08:43.899 --> 08:46.985
for supporting the other side
of my country's civil war.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.571
- Which country?
- Do you really wanna know

08:49.655 --> 08:53.033
or are you just asking because
we're gonna be on the plane for a while

08:53.116 --> 08:55.160
and you think
you should make small talk.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.828
The second thing.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.164
Open the door
or I'll start executing passengers!

09:01.333 --> 09:04.378
Man, coming on this trip
was a terrible idea.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.382
I know. Now I wish I'd just stayed home
and finished my remake of <i>Inside Out.</i>

09:08.924 --> 09:11.343
- I'm Joy.
- I'm Sadness.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.470
- I'm Anger.
- I'm Disgust.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.222
I'm Poo.

09:17.099 --> 09:20.018
Oh, I need to use the bathroom.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.562
<i>Yay! I win!</i>

09:27.776 --> 09:29.778
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>with a special report.</i>

09:29.862 --> 09:31.905
<i>A flight from San Francisco to Quahog</i>

09:31.989 --> 09:34.449
<i>has lost contact</i>
<i>with air traffic control.</i>

09:34.533 --> 09:37.119
Oh, my God.
That's your father's flight!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.746
<i>Government officials are monitoring</i>
<i>the situation closely.</i>

09:39.830 --> 09:42.416
<i>I'll be here to update you</i>
<i>as the story progresses.</i>

09:42.499 --> 09:45.460
<i>Coming up on the Midday News,</i>
<i>a couple in their 30s gets married</i>

09:45.544 --> 09:47.337
<i>without their dog</i>
<i>being in the wedding.</i>

09:47.421 --> 09:49.214
<i>You're not gonna believe their story.</i>

09:52.551 --> 09:53.719
What's it gonna be?

09:53.802 --> 09:56.805
Are you going to open this door
or am I going to start killing people?

09:56.889 --> 09:58.140
I'm not opening it.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.184
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask
the mom behind me

10:00.267 --> 10:03.145
who told me to stop watching
<i>Game of Thrones</i> on my laptop,

10:03.228 --> 10:06.190
if I'm still the worst person
on this plane?

10:06.857 --> 10:08.400
You, fat guy, get up here!

10:11.445 --> 10:14.323
Last chance. Open the door
or this idiot gets it.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.366
Don't open it, Quagmire.
It's not worth it.

10:16.450 --> 10:20.162
- Okay.
- Wait... Wait, what? That was quick.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.915
I'm sorry, Peter, but I have
to think about the whole plane.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.209
There's over 150 passengers
back there,

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
several of whom
are in our commander's club,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.630
and to them, I'd like to issue
a special welcome.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.757
Oh, man, we gotta help Peter.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.259
Those crazy European guys
are gonna kill him.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.345
You know, I have a gun
in the bag I checked.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.096
If we can get to the galley,

10:38.180 --> 10:40.849
we can take the elevator down
to the cargo hold.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.142
Good idea, Joe.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.854
Oh, man, it feels like we're in
one of those hijacking movies.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.022
You're right, it does.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.734
There's even an impatient businessman
who really wants to reach his destination,

10:50.817 --> 10:52.694
so he can conduct more business.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.696
Can't you see how important I am?

10:54.780 --> 10:56.865
My shirt is blue
but the collar is white.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.408
It's the same shirt!

10:58.492 --> 10:59.910
Quick. He's distracted.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.587
Get off my plane.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.631
Get off my plane.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.800
- What's that now?
- Hmm? Nothing.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.303
Always bet on black.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.222
Always bet on black.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.307
- Did you say something?
- I don't think so.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.269
Double trouble!

11:25.352 --> 11:26.687
That's it, we found it.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.606
What the hell? Hey!

11:29.690 --> 11:31.441
Two of the passengers are missing.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.319
Okay, you guys watch the main cabin.
I'll go find them.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.905
I'll take this fat guy
as a human shield.

11:36.989 --> 11:40.534
Oh, nice. Last guy picked for dodgeball,
first guy for human shield.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.083
Everybody be quiet.
There's another update.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.877
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

11:49.960 --> 11:53.297
<i>The search for a missing airliner</i>
<i>continues as speculation grows</i>

11:53.380 --> 11:55.007
<i>that the plane has been hijacked.</i>

11:55.090 --> 11:57.259
Oh, this is all so awful.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.345
What will our lives be like
if our husbands don't make it?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.725
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

12:06.310 --> 12:09.146
<i>Traveled down the road</i>
<i>and back again</i>

12:10.063 --> 12:11.857
<i>Your heart is true</i>

12:11.940 --> 12:15.485
<i>You're a pal and a confidant</i>

12:17.196 --> 12:23.368
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

12:25.913 --> 12:28.540
Oh, my God. Now I want Dad to die!

12:33.212 --> 12:36.590
Hey, Joe, look at me.
Do I look like Mickey the Mouse?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.300
Get out of people's stuff.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.718
Ah, here's my bag.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.225
Hey, what are you two doing down here?

12:48.977 --> 12:52.356
Oh, someone's shipping live lobsters. Yum.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.816
Prepare to die. You first.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.360
That's what you think.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.657
Peter, grab onto something!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.201
Uh-oh. I grabbed my own belt.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.516
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>
<i>I know we're being hijacked</i>

13:27.599 --> 13:29.434
<i>but I would be remiss</i>
<i>if I didn't point out</i>

13:29.518 --> 13:32.229
<i>that we're presently passing over</i>
<i>Yosemite National Park.</i>

13:33.063 --> 13:35.816
Wow, that is truly awe-inspiring.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.067
It certainly is.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.278
And you know what you don't see
from up here?

13:39.611 --> 13:40.612
Borders.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.580
Die in hell, Eurotrash!

13:49.997 --> 13:51.164
Hang on, Peter!

13:54.459 --> 13:56.003
Holy crap, that was close.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.630
Joe, how'd you know that lever
would open the landing gear?

13:58.714 --> 14:00.257
Wheels are my expertise, Peter.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.385
I notice every wheel in a room
as soon as I enter.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.600
Special delivery from the US of A.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.146
Rats. My bullets
are in my shaving kit.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.780
Get off my... Double trouble!

14:23.864 --> 14:25.490
- Sorry.
- Come on, man!

14:27.826 --> 14:30.120
Oh, my God. You guys did it.
We're saved!

14:30.329 --> 14:33.582
Yep. We wrapped this up quicker
than the treaty-signing at Appomattox.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.752
So if I sign this, the war is over,

14:36.835 --> 14:40.130
we surrender and we still
get to be dicks forever?

14:40.422 --> 14:42.549
Okay, you win.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.801
You can all relax now, everybody.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.804
We're ten minutes away from landing
in an airfield in Nevada.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.724
Looks like you'll make
that business meeting after all.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.352
Great. Thanks for keeping us
in the sky, boys.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.938
Now, reach for it.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.941
- You're one of the hijackers, too?
- Yes.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.735
I was in reserve
in case the plan went awry.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.739
And now I can finally get into
the cockpit and execute our plan,

15:06.031 --> 15:09.535
crashing this plane into the ultimate
symbol of American materialism,

15:09.785 --> 15:11.203
Las Vegas.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.747
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas

15:13.830 --> 15:16.166
but I never thought
I'd lose my life there.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.794
- Did you just think of that?
- Yeah, just now.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.712
You know, you are
seriously funny, man.

15:20.796 --> 15:23.632
I know I crap on you a lot
but sometimes when I'm driving,

15:23.715 --> 15:25.759
I think about
stuff you say and I laugh.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.886
- Thank you, Peter.
- No, thank you.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.355
Very good. We are less than 20 minutes
from Las Vegas.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.067
Get ready to say goodbye
to your precious Rita Rudner.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.945
Is your plan just to kill Rita Rudner?

15:45.153 --> 15:48.574
No, we're going to crash
into the biggest hotel on the Strip.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.077
Killing Rita Rudner will just be
the custard on the dumpling.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.539
You know, we never quite nailed down
what region you guys are from.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.505
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker,</i>
<i>with the latest on the hijacking crisis.</i>

16:03.589 --> 16:05.424
<i>As you can see</i>
<i>I've taken off my blazer</i>

16:05.507 --> 16:07.342
<i>to show the severity of the situation.</i>

16:07.426 --> 16:09.887
<i>We understand the plane</i>
<i>has been found by satellite.</i>

16:09.970 --> 16:11.763
<i>It's apparently</i>
<i>veered off its flight plan</i>

16:11.847 --> 16:13.682
<i>and is headed for Las Vegas.</i>

16:13.765 --> 16:17.019
<i>The government, fearing the worst,</i>
<i>is considering shooting it down.</i>

16:17.102 --> 16:18.979
<i>Now here's an over-the-top</i>
<i>news graphic.</i>

16:34.912 --> 16:37.539
Oh, look, there's one guy
who slept through this whole thing.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.209
Hey, buddy, wake up.
We're all about to die.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.002
What? What are you talking about?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.796
Yeah, I thought I should wake you up.
Nobody wants to die in their sleep.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.549
Oh, my God. No! I have a family!

16:47.633 --> 16:48.926
There you go.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.179
Only a few more minutes
until your country pays

16:52.262 --> 16:54.264
for its imperialistic sins.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.933
Us? What about you?

16:56.016 --> 16:59.645
Like, how come you Eastern European
guys can't be quieter in pornos?

16:59.728 --> 17:02.439
I mean, nobody's ever been, like,
"Yeah, yeah, more guy noises."

17:02.523 --> 17:06.109
They ask us to do that to cover up
the sound of children playing nearby.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.278
Now shut up and get ready to die!

17:16.912 --> 17:17.913
So, uh...

17:18.247 --> 17:20.290
- You ever been to Vegas before?
- No.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.752
Well, I think you're gonna
flip for it!

17:23.836 --> 17:25.379
Yeah!

17:32.219 --> 17:34.638
Attention, passengers, the plane...

17:37.266 --> 17:39.852
Oh, come on! Doesn't anybody
pay attention to the sign?

17:44.523 --> 17:46.275
That was some quick thinking, Glenn.

17:46.358 --> 17:49.069
And look, even that plane
with all the missiles is impressed.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.366
Missiles? That's a military fighter jet.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.951
He's here to shoot us down!

17:56.034 --> 17:57.911
- Or she.
- What?

17:57.995 --> 18:00.163
They must think the hijackers
still control the plane.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.748
And our communications are jammed,

18:01.832 --> 18:03.584
so we can't even tell them
everything's okay.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.419
Don't worry, I'll signal to him.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.130
Hey, we knocked out all the bad guys.

18:08.714 --> 18:09.965
See, we don't need your help.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.176
We kicked their asses
and we have their guns.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.178
<i>I've got a visual</i>
<i>on the terrorists.</i>

18:14.261 --> 18:17.014
<i>They've got a hostage in a blue shirt</i>
<i>with a white collar.</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:18.724
<i>He must be an important businessman.</i>

18:18.807 --> 18:20.767
<i>Copy that, prepare to engage.</i>

18:23.395 --> 18:24.688
Oh, good, he's moving away.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.107
No, he isn't.
He's getting in position to fire.

18:27.191 --> 18:30.277
He thinks we're gonna crash into
the Strip. Everybody in your seats!

18:52.090 --> 18:54.426
Frank Caliendo does
a five o'clock show.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.011
Quagmire, land this plane.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.103
We've been hit!

19:06.772 --> 19:09.024
Oh, God, this is it. We're gonna die!

19:09.107 --> 19:11.360
Like hell we are. We're gonna make it.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.794
We're going too fast!
We're gonna crash into that lake!

19:29.127 --> 19:30.629
Oh, no, we're not.

19:42.850 --> 19:44.935
Yeah, right there. That's good.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.521
And now to discharge
the plane's fire retardant.

19:48.814 --> 19:49.982
Giggity.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.871
Wow, Quagmire,
thanks for saving all of our lives.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.914
We're sorry for saying
your job was easy.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.083
Yeah, you're the best damn pilot
in the world.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.128
He's right.
What you did up there was amazing.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.130
Thanks, guys. That means a lot.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.757
- That was quite a trip, wasn't it?
- It sure was.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.927
And we learned a lot about blue jeans,
didn't we, guys?

20:19.011 --> 20:20.596
- Yes, yes, we did.
- That's right, Peter.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.639
Thank you for planning
a wonderful day.

20:27.811 --> 20:28.854
Cleveland!

20:28.937 --> 20:30.355
- Joe!
- Peter!

20:36.612 --> 20:39.823
Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled
a record of your credit card purchases

20:39.907 --> 20:41.950
in San Francisco and I saw some things

20:42.034 --> 20:43.952
I think you'd prefer to keep private.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.955
- We'll talk later, Chris.
- I think we will.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.041
I do believe we will.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.334
Well, let's head home.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.170
I know I, for one, am ready
to put all this behind us.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.463
Sounds good.

20:54.546 --> 20:57.883
Oh, yeah. In case we didn't say,
this was Spirit Airlines.
