WEBVTT

00:28.985 --> 00:30.291
What do we
got, Malone?

00:30.334 --> 00:32.249
DOA under the bushes
over there.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.903
No I.D. No personal property.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.905
-Any signs of foul play?
-No.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.603
-You found the body?
-Jogger over here did.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.562
Name's Elon Lubin.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.042
He was jogging,
checked his watch,

00:42.085 --> 00:44.087
then noticed him
-under those bushes.
-Thanks.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.393
Mr. Lubin?

00:45.436 --> 00:48.483
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.006
Is this your typical
jogging route?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.181
-It is.
-Did you know

00:51.225 --> 00:52.922
the deceased,
you ever seen him before?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.141
No.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.012
You see anything unusual
when you found it?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
Somebody near the
body, running away?

00:58.101 --> 01:00.712
No, it was early.
There was nobody else out here.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.236
Did you touch
him at all?

01:02.279 --> 01:04.107
No. I just called 911.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.109
He's probably
from the Grand Hotel.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.069
Grand Hotel? Isn't
that a high-end hotel?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.940
Used to be.
I think the city

01:10.983 --> 01:13.551
turned it into
a homeless shelter after COVID.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.336
-Uh-huh.
-Homeless hotel.

01:15.379 --> 01:18.121
Yeah. Guess he
checked out.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.691
Good morning.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.432
Ooh. Don't you
look spiffy.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.781
You have a hot date?

01:25.824 --> 01:27.478
Nope, this is for me.

01:27.522 --> 01:30.177
Oh, table for one,
please? I like it.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.482
A little self-love.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.789
We can all use a little more
of that these days.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.791
Can I ask you something?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.315
If you didn't know me,
would you make me for a cop?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.100
Maybe, but not definitely.

01:40.143 --> 01:43.407
If I was at the bar and you
had to guess my occupation,

01:43.451 --> 01:45.322
what would it be?

01:45.366 --> 01:47.150
Hmm.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.762
Baseball umpire.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.242
Baseball umpire?

01:52.286 --> 01:53.765
Where the hell
-did that come from?
-I don't know.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.550
I just can picture you
behind the plate

01:55.593 --> 01:59.249
kicking dust on people,
saying, "You're out of here!"

01:59.293 --> 02:01.773
I'll say this for you, Reagan,

02:01.817 --> 02:03.775
you know how
to brighten up a room.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.516
Now, what's bothering you?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.257
This clown at the bar last night

02:07.301 --> 02:10.086
took one look at me and assumed
that I was a mobster.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.609
I mean, do you
believe that?

02:11.653 --> 02:14.438
After a lifetime
of law enforcement?

02:14.482 --> 02:17.485
Were you wearing
a Sergio Tacchini sweat suit?

02:17.528 --> 02:19.487
Ha-ha-ha. Very funny.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.053
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.055
I mean, there I was,
uh, minding my own business,

02:23.099 --> 02:25.319
having a couple of pops,
and some guy plops down

02:25.362 --> 02:27.451
next to me and starts
talking to me crazy

02:27.495 --> 02:29.366
like I'm some kind of a wiseguy.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.499
Well, maybe you
misunderstood him.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.631
I mean, what exactly did he say?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.764
He asked me to kill his wife.

02:37.331 --> 02:41.770
Wow, Anthony, you really buried
the lede there, didn't you?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.862
Are you gonna read him
the riot act?

02:46.905 --> 02:49.821
The riot act was used to address
a mob of 12 or more.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.693
We just have the one.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.521
But it's not like
it's a nothing thing.

02:53.564 --> 02:54.826
It's definitely something.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.219
Yeah, he shot himself
in the foot,

02:56.263 --> 02:57.612
and the shot's gonna ricochet.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.266
Lot of collateral damage.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.876
Gonna be.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.183
Sorry I'm late.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.488
Your draft

03:04.532 --> 03:06.490
for the First Friday Club.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.275
I'll let you two catch up.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.319
Sid.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.715
What's going on?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.675
Ah. That?

03:17.719 --> 03:20.025
Yes. That.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.984
Sid had a good point.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.421
Just that the rank and
file ain't too happy

03:24.465 --> 03:26.989
about you throwing the boss
under the bus like that.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.121
I didn't throw him
under the bus.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.993
I didn't throw you
under the boss.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.039
"To be Frank, we can do better."

03:34.083 --> 03:34.997
Come on.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.390
After all this time,

03:36.433 --> 03:38.696
you guys don't know boilerplate
when you see it?

03:38.740 --> 03:41.133
I do, but I
sure don't see it here.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.657
What am I supposed to say?

03:42.700 --> 03:45.442
"No other police department
can hold a candle to us"?

03:45.486 --> 03:47.357
Like the sound of that
a little better, to be honest.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.185
It's a good thing
you don't have my job,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.578
'cause the second
I pat ourselves on the back,

03:50.621 --> 03:54.364
they point out every zit,
mole and wart we got.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.584
Okay. You got a point.

03:56.627 --> 03:57.585
Thank you.

03:57.628 --> 03:58.977
But I've got one, too.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.631
It's hard enough
on our people out there

04:00.675 --> 04:04.156
without them having to read
over their morning coffee

04:04.200 --> 04:05.897
you slapping them around.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.247
I did not slap them around.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.945
I know you didn't.
But they don't.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.990
Walk it back.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.284
How'd you afford to stay here
on a cop's salary?

04:44.327 --> 04:45.720
It was New Year's.
I think it was

04:45.763 --> 04:47.896
-a thousand bucks a night.
-Thou...

04:47.939 --> 04:50.159
Thousand bucks? Well,
it's not that expensive anymore.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.248
Yeah, you think?

04:52.988 --> 04:54.337
Excuse me, ma'am?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.339
Detective Reagan.
My partner Detective Baez.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.993
Do you know this man?

04:58.036 --> 04:59.342
That looks like Billy.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.735
Do you know
his last name?

05:00.778 --> 05:02.693
No.

05:02.737 --> 05:03.607
Sandy.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.609
Do you know
Billy's last name?

05:06.393 --> 05:09.613
Hey. Anyone know
Billy's last name?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.485
I think it's Rucker.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.269
No, no, no. Rutledge.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.488
Billy Rutledge.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.924
Billy stay here often?

05:15.967 --> 05:17.795
It's a first come,
first serve situation,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.406
but yeah,
he stayed here quite a bit.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.103
-And when he wasn't here?
-On the streets

05:21.146 --> 05:22.583
or in the park.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.193
Billy was a bit of a loner.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.282
He liked the open space
of the park.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.197
Even more than a nice,
warm bed, huh?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.503
Billy would have been
better served

05:29.546 --> 05:31.287
by a hospital than a hotel.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.288
Did something happen to him?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.768
I'm afraid
he passed away.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.857
He was found in the park
this morning.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.293
Did you know him well?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.512
Not really.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.731
Anybody know
where he was from?

05:40.775 --> 05:42.080
Next of kin?

05:42.124 --> 05:43.560
-I think

05:43.604 --> 05:46.824
I remember him saying
something about St. Louis.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.175
St. Louis?

05:51.481 --> 05:54.354
Long way from New York.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.706
I'm very sorry
to have to be the one

05:58.749 --> 06:00.795
to share this news
with you.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.405
I'm sure he was
a wonderful person.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.364
All of his friends say
the same thing.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.801
Yes, all very good things.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.368
Of course. If we learn
of anything else,

06:08.411 --> 06:11.327
we will definitely
give you a call.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.720
Very good, yes.

06:12.763 --> 06:16.419
Again, I am very sorry
for your loss. Bye.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.813
I mean, did you think
I was ordering takeout?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.815
No, but this is important.
You got to see this.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.948
Can it wait two minutes? I mean,
that was the grieving mother.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.559
I'm sorry, but this is relevant.

06:25.602 --> 06:28.562
-What am I looking at?
-Okay, this name.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.781
Elon Lubin.
That's the jogger

06:30.825 --> 06:33.697
who found our deceased
homeless person.
And?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.830
It's the third deceased
homeless person

06:35.873 --> 06:38.398
-he's found in the last year.
-What?

06:38.441 --> 06:41.531
Yes. He found one here,
here and here.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
That's a super weird
coincidence.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.537
Or not a coincidence at all.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.500
No, thank you.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.719
Why don't you want
to do it?
I'm not interested.

06:55.763 --> 06:59.157
-But I am.
-I can see that.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.942
So you should do it.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.900
Because you want to?
Yes.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.642
-How's that work?
-It's called marriage, Jamie.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.818
You do stuff for
each other.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.821
Great. The thing that I
want to do is not do that.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.041
By your logic, you should
not do it with me.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.869
Doesn't work like that.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.392
I didn't think so.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.742
Yours is a not.
That's negative.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.658
Mine is a do,
and that's positive.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.225
You realize we can
still be us

07:23.268 --> 07:26.228
while at the same time
remaining both me and you.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.534
Cognitive dissonance.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.318
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.929
-This is why we have to do this.
-Why?

07:31.973 --> 07:35.498
Because I don't understand what
you're saying half the time.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.718
Trust me, that may just be
the key to a happy marriage.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.763
At least, that's
what Churchill said.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.635
Winston Churchill
didn't say that.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.201
No, but he said that
spouses shouldn't

07:43.245 --> 07:44.768
see each other before lunch;
it's the same difference.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.422
You're continuing to
prove my point.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.945
I'm thoroughly confused.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.904
Okay, let me clear
the confusion for you.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.949
I have no idea what
a love language is.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.517
Really, no idea what
my love language is.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.258
But most importantly,
I have zero interest

07:56.301 --> 07:57.651
in figuring out what it is.

07:57.694 --> 07:58.565
But I do.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.305
Then you take the quiz.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.570
Jamie...

08:03.613 --> 08:06.921
Our neighborhood used to be
a quiet family community.

08:06.964 --> 08:10.925
It is now overrun
with homeless vagrants.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.667
Just the other day,
someone overdosed

08:13.710 --> 08:16.539
in the supermarket aisle
right next to a mother

08:16.583 --> 08:17.584
and her children.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.586
It is time for the city

08:19.629 --> 08:21.457
to shut this place down.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.938
That interview is
from last month?

08:23.981 --> 08:27.332
Yeah. He ran for city
council two years ago.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.682
A real politician.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.554
"Elon Lubin is a proud
progressive who is humbled

08:31.598 --> 08:33.948
"to be fighting for the rights
of all New York City residents

08:33.991 --> 08:37.342
"with a focus on diversity
and the underserved

08:37.386 --> 08:38.822
members of the community."

08:38.866 --> 08:40.607
Yeah, more like, "Give me
your tired, your poor,

08:40.650 --> 08:43.305
your hungry, just keep 'em
out of my neighborhood."

08:43.348 --> 08:44.828
Let's go pay him a visit.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.578
Hello, Detectives.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.537
You don't seem surprised
to see us.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.627
Surprised that New York's finest
is once again

09:00.670 --> 09:01.976
jumping to conclusions?

09:02.019 --> 09:03.630
No, not surprised at all.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.980
Well, when a guy who says he
hates having a homeless shelter

09:06.023 --> 09:08.243
in the neighborhood finds three
dead homeless people

09:08.286 --> 09:11.507
on three separate occasions,
it raises a few questions.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.988
I didn't do anything.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.076
Great. Then you won't mind

09:15.119 --> 09:16.556
coming down
to the squad room with us?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.906
I'll get my coat.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.218
Okay...

09:27.262 --> 09:28.611
anything else?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.352
That's the full lid, boss.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
Actually, there was
that other thing.

09:32.397 --> 09:35.531
Oh, yes, the other thing.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.186
That other thing.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.840
The clean-up on aisle six.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.537
The Garrett thing?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.191
I have read the paper
cover to cover,

09:43.234 --> 09:45.672
and for the life of me, I can't
find what I'm looking for.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.369
This is about that?

09:47.412 --> 09:49.414
I can't find any evidence

09:49.458 --> 09:52.635
of you walking back
a certain something.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.029
I thought about it.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.900
And then I decided
against it.

09:56.944 --> 10:00.600
Well, that explains why
I couldn't find it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.167
Any particular reason why?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.172
It wasn't sitting
well with me.

10:08.216 --> 10:11.436
And there it is.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.569
Okay,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.702
since Garrett is
technically a civilian,

10:15.745 --> 10:18.052
perhaps two of you
could explain to him

10:18.095 --> 10:21.403
the consequences of ignoring
a direct order.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.752
A charge of insubordination.

10:22.796 --> 10:26.016
You catch holy hell,
and you have it coming.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.409
That was a direct order?

10:27.452 --> 10:28.976
-Yes.
As I recall,

10:29.019 --> 10:31.326
you said something
along the lines

10:31.369 --> 10:33.067
of <i>maybe</i> I should walk it back.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.068
I did not say "maybe."

10:34.111 --> 10:35.417
I'm pretty sure you did.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.027
He did not say "maybe."He did not say "maybe."

10:37.071 --> 10:39.595
Well, okay, then.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.683
I stand corrected.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.424
Point is still the same, though.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.947
Which is?

10:43.991 --> 10:45.688
Frank, you don't want me
to walk it back.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
-I do want you to walk it back.
-You don't.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.039
-But I do.
You don't

10:49.083 --> 10:50.171
because it's a nonstory.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.868
Front page of the <i>Post.</i>

10:51.912 --> 10:54.175
Two days ago.
Literally yesterday's

10:54.218 --> 10:55.872
yesterday's news.
Second I walk it back,

10:55.916 --> 10:58.962
it becomes tomorrow's news.
I won't do it.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.445
You won't?

11:03.488 --> 11:06.187
But not in service of myself.
I'm doing it for you.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.277
Gee, it's been a long time

11:09.320 --> 11:12.541
since someone tried to sell me
on "this is gonna hurt me

11:12.584 --> 11:14.325
more than it does you."

11:14.369 --> 11:16.632
Get it done.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.635
That's an order.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.638
Okay.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.647
Just so's we're all clear,

11:31.691 --> 11:33.780
you're giving me a direct order

11:33.823 --> 11:35.825
to make matters worse.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.446
Am I under arrest?

11:48.490 --> 11:50.535
Should you be?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.103
You're filming me.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.280
Standard procedure. We record
all our conversations in here.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.325
I understand.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.326
What are you doing?

11:58.369 --> 11:59.849
Standard procedure.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.330
I record all my conversations
with police.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.723
Not in here, you don't.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.247
I'll turn off mine
if you turn off yours.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.860
-Suit yourself, smart guy.
-You think I'm smart?

12:10.904 --> 12:13.167
No, what I think is that
it's an incredible coincidence

12:13.210 --> 12:15.604
that you just happened to find
three dead homeless people

12:15.647 --> 12:17.084
in a few short months.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.868
I can see why you'd think that.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.217
-Mm-hmm.
You have to admit,

12:20.261 --> 12:21.349
the probability

12:21.392 --> 12:23.046
of something like that
is pretty low.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.440
-I do admit that.
So you understand why we wanted

12:25.483 --> 12:27.659
to bring you down here and ask
you a few questions about it.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.487
-I do.
And you

12:29.531 --> 12:30.924
can see that it's

12:30.967 --> 12:33.187
nearly impossible to believe
that one person

12:33.230 --> 12:35.624
could actually find
three dead homeless people

12:35.667 --> 12:37.278
and not somehow be involved.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.149
I was involved.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.325
You were involved?

12:42.065 --> 12:43.675
Great. Tell us
how you were involved.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.156
I was the one
who found them dead.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.592
Yeah, we know that part

12:47.636 --> 12:48.811
already,
but how were you involved

12:48.855 --> 12:49.899
in their deaths?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.161
That's how I was involved.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.946
I was the one who found them.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.512
Okay, you want to play games.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.036
Well, I'll tell you what I think

12:56.079 --> 12:57.646
and how I think you're involved.

12:57.689 --> 12:58.995
I think you're the one

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
that maybe killed
those homeless people.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.651
I can see
why you would think that.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.826
I'm sure you can.

13:03.870 --> 13:04.827
Where were you in the hours

13:04.871 --> 13:05.915
leading up to his death?

13:05.959 --> 13:07.264
I'm training for a marathon.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.048
I was jogging.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.659
-For two hours?
-Yes.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.226
Do you have a jogging partner

13:12.269 --> 13:14.837
or anyone
who can corroborate your story?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
-I run alone.
-Course you do.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.841
What is that supposed to mean?

13:18.885 --> 13:21.801
It means
you're free to run along.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.803
Goodbye.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.987
You really marched him
out of here quick.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.206
He told the officer on the scene
that he was looking

13:36.250 --> 13:38.556
at his smartwatch
when he saw the dead body.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.949
Yeah, so?

13:39.993 --> 13:41.951
Means his app
was tracking him with GPS.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.953
We want to find out
what he was doing

13:43.997 --> 13:45.868
and where he was
before the time of death,

13:45.912 --> 13:48.262
all we got to do
is look at his phone.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.047
You really think that guy's
just gonna hand it over?

13:51.091 --> 13:52.962
No.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.881
Yes, Baker.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
Incoming.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.060
I can't not speak up.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.891
By all means, then.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.066
This is a mistake.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.763
What, you barging in here
like this?

14:11.807 --> 14:14.462
No, my walking
the comments back.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.594
It's my job and, yes,

14:16.638 --> 14:18.553
even my calling to do

14:18.596 --> 14:20.816
what I think is best
for you and the department.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.122
Whether I like it or not.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.993
Whether you recognize it or not.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.952
Garrett, to be blunt, your job

14:25.995 --> 14:28.737
is to offer your opinion.
Nothing more.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.043
In that case,

14:30.086 --> 14:32.045
it's my considered opinion

14:32.088 --> 14:34.961
that you should tell your ego
to sit this one out.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.789
Right back at you.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.226
I have no skin in this game.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.489
Oh, the hell you don't.
You put us both out there

14:41.532 --> 14:43.491
on the cover of the <i>Post.</i>

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
You know what?

14:45.101 --> 14:47.582
Maybe there was a time
you'd be right about that.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.671
Inserting myself

14:49.714 --> 14:50.933
in the story.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.761
But those days are long gone.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.241
And where did they go?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.417
I'm living
a more authentic life.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.984
I can't even imagine

14:58.027 --> 15:00.029
the question
that's an answer to.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.423
That question would be
"how have you changed?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.729
How have you grown?"

15:04.773 --> 15:06.209
Actually, you've shrunk.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.777
I'm talking
about personal growth.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.170
I know that.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.736
Holding honesty
in higher regard.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.042
Living more truthfully.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.522
I know that, Garrett.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.177
But that's neither here
nor there on this matter.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.135
If the world
thinks we're at odds,

15:19.179 --> 15:20.702
then we're at odds.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.833
But we're not.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.052
How many times have you stood

15:23.096 --> 15:24.749
right there on that spot

15:24.793 --> 15:28.318
and preached to me
that perception trumps reality?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.105
Mm.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.369
Garrett?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.159
Okay.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.863
Okay, can you say
something into the mic?

15:51.907 --> 15:53.474
Test it out?

15:53.517 --> 15:54.866
You think I'm funny?

15:54.910 --> 15:56.825
I make you laugh?
I amuse you?

15:56.868 --> 15:57.826
That's perfect.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.523
I don't get it.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.831
Forget it.
I'm just getting into character.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.181
All right. Well, if you do
see him in the bar again,

16:05.225 --> 16:06.835
make sure to get
close enough.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.011
If he says anything,
it will be recorded.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.926
Not the first time
I'm wearing a wire.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.449
Just a friendly reminder.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.235
We usually only get one
crack at these things.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.888
Gonna nail this guy
to the wall, Erin.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.890
-Mark my words.
-No vague terms.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
No mobster movie lingo.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
All right?
Anything ambiguous

16:22.677 --> 16:24.461
will not hold up in court.

16:24.505 --> 16:25.723
Got you.

16:25.767 --> 16:29.379
Aw. I love when you guys
play cops and robbers.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.164
Danny. What are you doing here?

16:31.207 --> 16:32.600
He's here for a subpoena

16:32.643 --> 16:34.297
or a warrant. Mark my words.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.995
That's the only reason why

16:36.038 --> 16:38.736
-he ever comes around.
-Actually, I came
to see you, Anthony.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.870
Was wondering if you could
give me that, uh, low-carb diet

16:41.913 --> 16:43.524
that you've been
telling me about.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.266
It's called Rogaine.
You should try it sometime.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.963
Ah. I already do try that.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.139
Okay, so what's the case, Danny?

16:50.183 --> 16:52.620
I literally just said
I'm not here for that.

16:52.663 --> 16:53.925
And I literally grew up
in the bedroom

16:53.969 --> 16:55.144
across the hall from you.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.754
She's a human lie detector.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.060
So what's the case?

16:58.104 --> 17:00.758
Okay, since you asked,
there is a guy,

17:00.802 --> 17:04.980
an Upper West Side elite
who pretends to be a politician

17:05.024 --> 17:06.764
who cares for the homeless
and the poor,

17:06.808 --> 17:09.071
until a homeless shelter
opens up in his neighborhood

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
and then he goes
on a rampage.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.553
Then, suddenly, three
dead homeless people

17:12.596 --> 17:16.383
materialize and he happens
to find all three bodies.

17:16.426 --> 17:21.866
So, he kills them, and then
he reports the dead bodies?

17:21.910 --> 17:24.565
Don't you have a sandwich
you should be eating somewhere?

17:24.608 --> 17:28.090
You know, my badge is the same
-shade of gold as yours, pal.
-Oh...

17:28.134 --> 17:30.745
Mm, I didn't notice it
under your waistline.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.051
More body shaming.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.443
You know, at five-eight,
you would think

17:33.487 --> 17:35.619
you wouldn't want
to stoop any lower.

17:35.663 --> 17:39.580
All right, Lord, will you
little boys please knock it off?

17:39.623 --> 17:41.103
-He started it.
-Oh, my God.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.235
I literally hate you both
right now.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.106
-Yeah,

17:44.150 --> 17:45.890
he always starts it.
You always start it.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.109
-Well, now I'll finish it.
-Yeah.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.371
And take your hair with you.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.677
-You should take a hike, too.
-Get out of here.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.982
Burn a few.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.129
Affirmations is her love language.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.479
But he's acts of service.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.265
We're literally speaking
different languages.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.571
Exactly.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.226
You, try again.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.797
What I appreciate the most is

18:22.840 --> 18:25.278
that I always come home
to a clean and neat home.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.497
Aw. Really?

18:28.759 --> 18:30.979
You do an amazing job.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.373
That's really great, you guys.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.984
Officer Janko,

18:36.027 --> 18:37.681
can I see you
for a minute?

18:37.725 --> 18:40.597
Hang on a second,
just-- keep it up.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.170
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.868
Hi.
Hi.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.175
Is something wrong?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.873
Could you not do that here?

18:55.917 --> 18:57.005
Not do what?

18:57.048 --> 18:58.615
Whatever that was.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.923
That was me helping people
resolve conflict.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.229
By playing Oprah?

19:04.273 --> 19:06.406
I'll have you know
that when I responded

19:06.449 --> 19:10.018
to their apartment, those two
were at each other's throats.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.629
So you refer them
to family court.

19:12.673 --> 19:13.674
Which I did.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.197
And yet here they are.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.460
Oh, don't worry, Jamie,
social services is on their way.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.940
They'll be there
in three months.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.550
That's how
backed up they are.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.770
So you decided to give them
a relationship quiz

19:22.813 --> 19:24.337
from a fashion magazine instead?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.555
Whatever works.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.209
Eddie, this is
a police precinct.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.080
-So?
-So what's next?

19:29.124 --> 19:30.821
"Do I look fat in these jeans?"

19:32.258 --> 19:34.869
You know what, Jamie,
I'm pretty sure

19:34.912 --> 19:37.654
I know your love language
is physical touch.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.438
Okay, so?

19:38.481 --> 19:40.657
So here you go, lover.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.335
Morning, Elon.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.816
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.121
Why?

20:10.165 --> 20:11.819
It's a free country,
last I checked.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.255
This is harassment.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.910
-You're recording me again, huh?
-That's right.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.825
Well, I'm afraid
you can't do that this time.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.609
In fact, give me the phone,
please.

20:19.653 --> 20:20.567
The hell I will.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.090
If you don't give me the phone,

20:22.133 --> 20:23.091
I'm gonna take the phone.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.266
You can't do that.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.313
Actually, I can.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.271
A warrant?

20:29.315 --> 20:31.142
Happy trails.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.195
Can I be honest with you?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.066
I'm kind of nervous.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.112
That's perfectly normal.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.766
Just relax, tell me
what's going on.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.943
Well, I'm not really sure
how this works.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.292
How does it work?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.554
Well, when we were in here
the other night,

20:51.598 --> 20:53.295
you approached me
and asked me for help

20:53.339 --> 20:55.906
with a certain problem you had.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.952
So why don't you walk me
through exactly

20:57.995 --> 21:01.347
what you're looking for,
and I'll see if I can help.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.742
Well, I've been married
a long time.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.222
Nearly 20 years.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.658
That is a long time.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.140
She was the love of my life.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.447
Still is, if I'm totally
honest with myself.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.100
So what's the problem?

21:16.144 --> 21:19.147
She don't love me anymore.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.975
I come home from work,

21:21.018 --> 21:22.846
there's never a kind word.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.894
I try to make things
romantic.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.069
She's not interested.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.463
It's like I...

21:30.506 --> 21:33.117
I don't know what
I did wrong. You know?

21:33.161 --> 21:34.554
Look, it happens.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.033
You're married
a long time and all.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.775
-You know, these things happen.
-It's all my fault.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.821
I let myself go.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.389
I got fat and lazy.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.000
I stopped thinking of fun things
for us to do.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.654
It's no wonder

21:47.697 --> 21:50.787
she started sleeping
with my brother.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.487
Your brother? Your wife is
sleeping with your brother?

21:54.530 --> 21:56.184
-Yeah.
-No, no, no.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.273
No, no, no, no, d-don't
cry like that, come on.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.362
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

22:00.406 --> 22:03.496
for wasting your time.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.585
I don't want to kill my wife.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.892
Oh... I still love her.

22:08.936 --> 22:12.374
I love her more than anything.
I just want her

22:12.418 --> 22:14.507
to love me back.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.204
It's okay, folks.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.597
He just had a few too many.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.860
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.427
Come on, pull yourself
together, man.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.429
There's people all over
the place here.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.356
Once I jailbreak the phone,
I'll have full and complete

22:37.399 --> 22:39.227
access to any and all
information on its contents.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.098
Just the fitness app.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.578
That's all we have
access to.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.232
She knows, and I know.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.016
Just making sure you know.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.714
Oh, I do know.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.455
I also know that
he thought he was

22:49.498 --> 22:50.760
so much smarter than us.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.502
Well, it certainly sounds
like you showed him.

22:53.546 --> 22:57.027
I did show him. You should have
seen the look on his face

22:57.071 --> 22:58.812
when I took the phone
from his hand

22:58.855 --> 23:00.204
and replaced it
with a warrant.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.468
Well, let's just hope we
find something useful.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.426
We will. A smoking gun.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.037
-I hope so.
-But you don't think so.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.518
I don't know.
I said I hope so.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.085
You want to bet?

23:11.128 --> 23:12.695
No, I don't want to bet.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.044
I sincerely hope so.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.525
Sincerely <i>hope</i> so.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.049
-Doesn't sincerely <i>think</i> so.
-Detectives...

23:19.093 --> 23:21.312
there's a map of his run.

23:23.097 --> 23:26.622
Two and a half hours,
no stops, no detours.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.407
No smoking gun.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.147
I know.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.412
Got a minute?

23:33.455 --> 23:35.196
Sure.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.765
Ah, both of you.

23:38.808 --> 23:39.809
That okay?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.637
Depends. Are you armed?

23:42.943 --> 23:45.336
What'd you do with
all your stuff?

23:45.380 --> 23:48.514
I'm in the process
of letting go.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.472
Of stuff, of old ways...

23:50.516 --> 23:52.561
You're gonna get
let go of your job

23:52.605 --> 23:53.823
if you don't wake up.

23:53.867 --> 23:54.911
Metro editor
of the <i>Post</i> just called

23:54.955 --> 23:56.217
for the commissioner.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.828
A newspaper editor
made a phone call?

23:58.872 --> 24:00.917
This is a bulletin why?

24:00.961 --> 24:02.266
That call was about you.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.443
Frank asked me to
speak with him.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.488
A direct order,
if you remember correctly.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.882
Right. And those orders were
to walk those comments back.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.753
Not to put it to bed.

24:10.797 --> 24:15.236
"My apologies to the men
and women of the NYPD

24:15.279 --> 24:17.673
"who took my challenge to
do better as a criticism.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.110
"As a man who's on his
fourth marriage,

24:20.154 --> 24:21.938
"you'd think by now
I would have learned

24:21.982 --> 24:23.592
to keep my mouth shut."

24:23.636 --> 24:26.116
I thought a touch of humor
might lighten the tone.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.031
I think maybe wasn't
your only goal.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.294
What are you getting at?

24:30.338 --> 24:31.426
Even I could see
what you were really

24:31.470 --> 24:32.819
doing with that statement.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.124
And what was that?

24:34.168 --> 24:35.299
Letting the
reporter know that

24:35.343 --> 24:36.823
you were taken
to the woodshed.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.128
By the commissioner.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.652
And you weren't too
happy about it.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.524
Hmm. Maybe I'm not as good
a liar as I used to be.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.135
Well, it's your job.
Get back in shape.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.355
You know what, Sid,

24:47.398 --> 24:49.618
you might be onto something.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.273
Maybe I don't want
to lie anymore.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.144
What could be less authentic

24:54.188 --> 24:56.495
than working to be
a better liar?

24:57.191 --> 24:58.671
Can I just say something?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.501
I think everyone in this office
has done a pretty good job

25:02.544 --> 25:04.633
supporting you on this journey.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.809
Losing the weight,
addressing the drinking.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.811
The new weird way of talking.

25:08.855 --> 25:12.772
We're not just happy for you.
We're proud of you.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.164
But?

25:14.208 --> 25:17.298
This is still police
headquarters.

25:17.341 --> 25:20.170
He is still our
police commissioner,

25:20.214 --> 25:24.261
and all of us still
work for him.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.657
Well, I sure didn't
see that coming.

25:28.701 --> 25:29.789
Neither did I,

25:29.832 --> 25:32.008
nor did the
thousand-dollar-an-hour

25:32.052 --> 25:34.445
surveillance team
that I signed off on.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.100
Not my fault
the guy started blubbering.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.842
A far cry from ordering
a hit on someone.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.496
No pun intended.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.020
Cry, cry? Get it?

25:44.064 --> 25:46.196
Oh, right. Wonderful.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.328
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.329
I feel bad for the guy.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.373
His wife stepping out on him

25:49.417 --> 25:50.461
with his own brother.

25:50.505 --> 25:51.506
There are eight million stories

25:51.550 --> 25:53.464
in the naked city, Anthony.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.162
We're just not supposed to
put surveillance

25:55.205 --> 25:56.642
on every single one of them.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.861
I-I said I was sorry.
What more do you want from me?

25:58.905 --> 26:02.169
Nothing. I just wish we had
something to show for it.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.649
Something to show for what?

26:03.692 --> 26:05.694
No, no, no, no, no.
You get out.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.566
What are you talking about?
What'd I do?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.785
You're coming around
looking for a warrant.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.787
Forget it, pal,
we gave at the office.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.572
You're just gonna let him
turn me away like that?

26:13.615 --> 26:15.835
No, actually, I'd like to
do it myself.

26:15.878 --> 26:19.316
Read my lips, you are not
getting another warrant.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.623
I don't want another warrant.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.147
-Okay, sorry.
-Don't fall for it.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.235
What do you need?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.672
I'd like you to ask the judge

26:26.715 --> 26:28.064
to broaden the scope

26:28.108 --> 26:29.718
of the warrant that
you already gave me.

26:29.762 --> 26:30.806
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You get out! Get out!

26:30.850 --> 26:32.242
-What?
-I told you.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.330
Told her what?

26:33.374 --> 26:35.681
Get out before I
start screaming.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.271
Before you say anything,
please hear me out.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.317
Okay.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.059
A year and a half ago,
I set out to lose some weight.

27:06.102 --> 27:10.150
A few months later,
did away with booze.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.109
And I'm proud of you.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.764
Started lifting weights,
keeping a journal.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.071
I even picked up meditation.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.160
I reinvented.

27:20.203 --> 27:23.903
I... grew.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.774
I changed.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.343
Okay.

27:29.386 --> 27:32.128
You like things one way.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.870
Usually the old way,
and always your way.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.656
You're not gonna
lay this off on me.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.135
I didn't mean it that way.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.702
I meant...

27:41.921 --> 27:44.575
...consistency
is your North Star.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.577
And that's a bad thing?

27:46.621 --> 27:48.492
Not at all.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.452
You have exactly the same lunch,

27:51.495 --> 27:54.324
wearing a version
of the same suit,

27:54.368 --> 27:56.979
at precisely the same time

27:57.023 --> 27:59.678
every day.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.549
Your weekend revolves around

28:01.592 --> 28:03.682
a dinner every single Sunday

28:03.725 --> 28:06.162
with people you've known
your entire life, and...

28:06.206 --> 28:08.730
Garrett, I'm gonna
stop you here.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.041
Please turn around.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.703
Thank you.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.705
You dispute what I'm saying?

28:29.577 --> 28:31.971
No, it's all true.

28:32.014 --> 28:35.975
And you're right, change can
be good for a person.

28:36.018 --> 28:39.456
You're also right that
we can do better in some areas,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.371
like you told the newspapers.

28:41.415 --> 28:42.982
Then why are you pushing back?

28:43.025 --> 28:47.073
Garrett, I need to think of you
as a pit bull.

28:47.116 --> 28:51.730
One who I can snap my fingers
and sic on whoever

28:51.773 --> 28:54.820
or whatever I think needs
to be chased off.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.214
If I can't...

29:00.869 --> 29:03.132
I'm no longer of use?

29:04.917 --> 29:08.398
You're a bright, talented man,

29:08.442 --> 29:10.966
and a good friend.

29:14.274 --> 29:19.453
But you're not gonna be able
to reinvent what you do here.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.803
It is what it is.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.197
It's not gonna change.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.334
Could you pass
the green beans?

29:34.642 --> 29:35.861
Erin, the green beans?

29:35.904 --> 29:37.688
Oh, sorry, you want this?

29:37.732 --> 29:39.778
That's why he asked you
three times.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.129
Okay, well, I didn't hear him.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.261
I'm sorry, Jamie,
here you go.
That's okay.

29:45.305 --> 29:48.656
Maybe she just thinks you're not
deserving of the green beans.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.007
Everything okay between you two?

29:52.051 --> 29:54.183
-Fine by me.
-Not buying it.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.577
Danny thinks it's
"bring your work home

29:56.620 --> 29:58.274
to family dinner" day again.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.102
Maybe you could tell Erin
that the job isn't finished

30:00.146 --> 30:01.930
till the bad guy's behind bars.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.802
And maybe you can tell Danny

30:03.845 --> 30:05.151
that he's being a sore loser.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.153
I'm your father,
not your referee.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.894
Sounds like these two
could use a little help

30:08.937 --> 30:11.331
in the love language department.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.072
Ow.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.508
Everything okay over there?

30:14.551 --> 30:16.118
All good.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.511
Boy.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.035
I'm not a sore loser. Bull crap.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.126
What was that,
Mr. "can I borrow the car today,

30:24.170 --> 30:25.171
please, Dad"?

30:25.214 --> 30:28.435
Father is as gracious
in victory

30:28.478 --> 30:29.828
as he is in defeat.
Yeah.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.613
Will someone please fill me in?

30:32.656 --> 30:36.573
Apparently, Erin is refusing
to give Danny a warrant.

30:36.617 --> 30:37.836
No, I already gave him one.

30:37.879 --> 30:38.967
Oh, you struck out.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.360
No, I didn't strike out.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.492
Okay, he struck out,
but now he wants one

30:42.536 --> 30:43.493
with broader scope?

30:43.537 --> 30:44.451
There you go.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.844
Can I just say

30:45.887 --> 30:46.932
that three homeless people
have been found

30:46.975 --> 30:48.411
dead in three months,

30:48.455 --> 30:51.327
and the guy who I like for it,
who just happens to hate

30:51.371 --> 30:53.329
having homeless people
in his neighborhood,

30:53.373 --> 30:55.941
is the guy that found
all three of the bodies.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.899
Am I barking up
the wrong tree here?

30:57.943 --> 30:59.292
No one said you were wrong.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.511
So you agree with me
and still won't help.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.773
That's even worse.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.340
It's not my job to help you.

31:04.384 --> 31:07.213
Exactly what's wrong with the
criminal justice system.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.345
Actually, that's what's
right with the system.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.347
Okay, jury,

31:11.391 --> 31:13.045
what say you?

31:14.220 --> 31:15.264
Team Erin.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.746
-Erin.
-Danny.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.357
Team Erin.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.185
I mean, I-- Danny.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.447
Team Danny.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.796
No, no, no, no, no.
That's jury tampering.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.754
I didn't say a word to him.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.016
Francis,

31:28.060 --> 31:30.149
you have the deciding vote.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.983
The obstacle is the way, Danny.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.202
I don't know
what that means, Dad.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.596
I think it means
that I won.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.902
It means...

31:43.945 --> 31:45.904
you don't have it yet.
Mm.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.428
But you will get it.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.706
Hello?

32:05.749 --> 32:07.490
Anyone home?

32:07.534 --> 32:09.362
Hey. Thanks for coming.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.059
Thanks for inviting me.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.235
You know how much I love
to spend Sunday nights

32:13.279 --> 32:14.367
in the squad.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.934
I know. I'm sorry.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.849
But I brought you a plate from
Sunday dinner if that helps.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.982
-Thanks, that was thoughtful.
-Yeah.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.288
You're welcome.

32:22.331 --> 32:24.594
Do you remember the woman Sandy

32:24.638 --> 32:26.857
-from the homeless hotel?
-No.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.773
The one who told us that the
deceased was from St. Louis.

32:29.817 --> 32:30.992
Sort of.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.167
I pulled her file.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.603
She spent most of her adult life

32:33.647 --> 32:36.476
in and out of mental hospitals.

32:36.519 --> 32:38.565
Borderline personality disorder,
schizophrenia,

32:38.608 --> 32:41.307
violent tendencies,
three suicide attempts.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.962
That's not uncommon
in the homeless population.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.267
Sad and true.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.616
Doesn't mean
she had anything to do

32:46.660 --> 32:47.966
with Billy Rutledge's murder.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.316
She said she barely knew him,
remember?

32:50.359 --> 32:51.839
Yeah.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.102
About Billy Rutledge's murder.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.846
We already saw this.

32:58.889 --> 33:01.196
Yeah, except we didn't see
this part.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.986
That's Billy.

33:10.466 --> 33:13.339
And that's Sandy.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.210
And that's a problem.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.624
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.104
Anything you say can

33:39.147 --> 33:41.062
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.324
You have the right
to an attorney.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.326
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

33:44.370 --> 33:46.502
one will be provided for you.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.983
Do you understand the rights
I've just read to you?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.985
I do. Do you?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.987
I watch a lot of TV.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.293
So you're clear
on your rights?

33:54.336 --> 33:56.469
You understand
what's happening here?

34:00.168 --> 34:01.822
You know what?

34:01.865 --> 34:03.389
You want to know the truth?

34:03.432 --> 34:04.477
I'm relieved.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.392
Because we're here?

34:07.784 --> 34:09.482
Billy was one of the good ones.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.006
He didn't deserve
what she did to him.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.616
Who is "she"?

34:14.530 --> 34:17.229
The bad one inside of me.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.842
Okay.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.844
Well, maybe we'll get her
some help.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.367
Sound like a plan?

34:27.804 --> 34:30.155
Come on, Sandy.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.982
Come on.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.120
Excuse us.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.562
Excuse us.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.360
I don't know about this,
Anthony.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.492
Come on,
you're the one that said

35:03.536 --> 35:05.755
you wish we had something
to show for all our work.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.714
Well, I meant making a case.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.890
Well, we're making a difference.
Same thing.

35:09.933 --> 35:13.154
I don't know that this qualifies
as making a difference.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.288
At the end of the day our job
is to help people, right?

35:17.593 --> 35:19.117
Yeah, I suppose.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.597
So that's what we're doing.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.776
Is that your friend Lenny?

35:26.820 --> 35:28.604
Yeah, and his brother Jerome.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.087
Be careful.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.319
Hey, watch it, pal!

35:47.362 --> 35:49.538
Oh, I'm sorry
about that, Jerome.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.931
"Jerome"?

35:50.974 --> 35:52.454
Do we know each
other or something?

35:52.498 --> 35:54.717
Nah, you don't know me,
Jerry, but I know you.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.893
I know things about you
even you don't know.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.112
Hey, I don't want
any problems.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.505
Oh, it's too late
for that, Jerry.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.463
'Cause I'm one big,
fat, giant problem

36:01.507 --> 36:04.814
that just fell
into your weaselly little lap.

36:04.858 --> 36:05.989
What's going on here?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.730
What's going on is...

36:07.774 --> 36:09.210
you upset the people I work for.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.343
And believe me, Jerry,

36:11.386 --> 36:13.171
you don't want
to upset those people.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.216
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.131
You don't know this,
but your brother's an honored

36:17.175 --> 36:19.742
and well-respected friend
of my boss.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.135
Lenny?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.441
That's right.

36:22.484 --> 36:25.139
And when you disrespect Lenny,

36:25.183 --> 36:27.054
you disrespect
my boss.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.838
And that's when I show up

36:28.882 --> 36:30.275
to deliver a message.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.234
No, no, no, no, don't shoot!

36:34.017 --> 36:35.193
Look at that.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.977
Look familiar?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.848
Look what you've done!

36:38.892 --> 36:41.024
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.417
I'll never
do it again.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.027
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.377
Your own brother,

36:45.420 --> 36:47.727
you snively little creep.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.393
Hey, babe.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.438
That blouse
looks beautiful.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.657
It does?

37:04.700 --> 37:06.789
You always make me laugh.

37:06.833 --> 37:07.877
I do?

37:07.921 --> 37:09.009
Hair looks great, too.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.010
You get a cut and color?

37:10.053 --> 37:11.533
Did I get a cut and color?

37:11.577 --> 37:13.492
Do I <i>ever</i> get a cut and color?

37:13.535 --> 37:15.885
See, that's
what I love about you.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.322
You're 100% natural.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.801
Jamie, what the hell's going on?

37:18.845 --> 37:20.716
What?

37:20.760 --> 37:22.805
Nothing's going on.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.678
Oh, you got me

37:25.721 --> 37:27.810
daisies?

37:27.854 --> 37:29.029
Your favorite, right?

37:29.072 --> 37:30.944
Mm... lilies.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.555
Oh, oops. My bad.

37:33.599 --> 37:34.774
It's okay.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.254
It's, um, just fine.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.777
Oh, sorry.
That's okay.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.213
Ow! Could you not?

37:39.257 --> 37:40.562
Sorry. Too hard?

37:40.606 --> 37:41.824
What are you doing?

37:41.868 --> 37:43.043
You know what I thought
we could do tonight?

37:43.086 --> 37:44.827
Watch TV and pass out?

37:44.871 --> 37:47.047
No, head to Central Park

37:47.090 --> 37:49.092
for a hike.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.878
Jamie, I just worked
a double.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.401
Would you rather
we do a spa day?

37:55.795 --> 37:57.100
Oh.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.102
Oh, I see what's happening.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.757
You complimented my hair.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.237
Words of affirmation.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.065
There's a frittata
on the stove.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.154
Acts of service.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.025
You got me flowers--
gifts.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.245
You gave me a massage.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.681
Physical touch.

38:12.725 --> 38:15.075
And a hike in the freezing
cold-- quality time.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.512
You got all five love languages.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.993
Well, I didn't know which was
your language, so I...

38:20.036 --> 38:21.473
tried to do all five.

38:21.516 --> 38:24.302
It was a little much.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.827
Well, maybe...

38:27.870 --> 38:30.264
you were right, maybe...

38:30.308 --> 38:33.311
we should just start
with English.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.965
In that case, I'm sorry.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.315
You're sorry?

38:37.358 --> 38:40.405
I don't want to be
the husband that...

38:40.448 --> 38:42.929
belittles his wife
when all she's trying to do

38:42.972 --> 38:44.931
is make us better.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.498
Have more fun.

38:48.238 --> 38:50.458
Oh, God.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.462
You did it.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.376
Did what?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.769
This whole time I've been trying

38:56.812 --> 38:59.511
to figure out
what my love language is,

38:59.554 --> 39:02.340
and you just showed me.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.777
Words of affirmation.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.169
Oh...

39:09.564 --> 39:11.958
-I'm actually acts of service.
-Mm.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.047
And I have one act...

39:14.090 --> 39:16.005
Don't ruin this moment for me!

39:16.049 --> 39:17.659
Okay.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.854
Heard you were looking for me.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.987
Yes.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.989
I, uh...

39:43.032 --> 39:45.295
I stopped by your office.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.734
I wanted to give this to you

39:48.777 --> 39:50.388
in person.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.871
I don't want this.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.570
You don't know what it is.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.747
-It's a sealed envelope.
-So?

40:01.790 --> 40:04.663
I don't want anything that comes
from you in a sealed envelope.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.883
You and I, we talk--
that's what we do.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.713
Look.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.586
You unloaded quite
a bit the other day.

40:14.629 --> 40:15.674
I did.

40:15.717 --> 40:16.805
So did you.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.633
I did.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.156
Uh...

40:20.200 --> 40:22.507
there is one thing

40:22.550 --> 40:24.422
I would like to walk back.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.425
Look, I've been at this
a long time.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.470
I've been blessed
to have great partners

40:29.514 --> 40:31.864
when I was on the job.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.693
And here in this job,

40:34.736 --> 40:38.000
there is no one
I would rather have

40:38.044 --> 40:40.786
ride shotgun with me than you.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.616
Thank you.

40:44.659 --> 40:47.053
What about our conversation
does that walk back?

40:47.096 --> 40:49.359
What might've appeared
to be an ultimatum

40:49.403 --> 40:51.710
about you staying on here.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.233
Ah.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.713
Again...

40:54.756 --> 40:56.932
if you and I got something
to say to each other,

40:56.976 --> 40:58.804
we just say it.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.415
Formal notices are for lawyers
and landlords.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.764
It's...

41:03.635 --> 41:06.246
Last minute of the Channel Two
news last night

41:06.289 --> 41:07.769
was one of those
heartwarming stories

41:07.813 --> 41:09.510
they like to tuck you in with.

41:09.554 --> 41:12.513
A prison guard at Attica
who moonlights volunteering

41:12.557 --> 41:15.821
as a yoga instructor
for special needs kids.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.913
That's a long day.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.872
Got me to thinking.

41:23.916 --> 41:26.484
No reason a pit bull
can't also be, say,

41:26.527 --> 41:28.529
a healthy teetotaler

41:28.573 --> 41:31.314
who meditates
and keeps a journal.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.799
But...

41:37.843 --> 41:41.673
a pit bull with the highest
regard for honesty?

41:43.588 --> 41:45.459
"Highest" is
a relative term when you're

41:45.503 --> 41:47.461
ten feet down in the trenches.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.811
It is what it is.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.685
Then what's in here?

41:53.728 --> 41:57.297
Copy of my letter
to the metro editor at the <i>Post,</i>

41:57.340 --> 41:58.603
walking my remarks back.

41:58.646 --> 42:01.301
Stuffing them
in the trunk of a car

42:01.344 --> 42:04.913
and backing that car
into a swamp.

42:08.177 --> 42:11.311
You know I thought this was
a resignation letter.

42:11.354 --> 42:12.965
I know.

42:13.008 --> 42:15.010
I'm glad to say it isn't.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.276
I'm glad to hear it.
