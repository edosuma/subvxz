WEBVTT

00:55.388 --> 00:56.347
<i>And of course,</i>

00:57.057 --> 01:00.310
there I was at the foot of the stage,

01:00.393 --> 01:04.230
beating my breasts
and howling at the sky…

01:05.065 --> 01:10.153
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!"

01:10.236 --> 01:11.863
-And then…

01:11.946 --> 01:15.742
suddenly, the rest of the play was gone.

01:15.825 --> 01:19.079
I could hear them whispering,
"Good heavens!"

01:19.162 --> 01:21.748
"He's forgotten his lines!"

01:22.290 --> 01:24.292
And then, it happened again

01:24.375 --> 01:25.502
in St. Louis.

01:25.585 --> 01:29.130
And the next night in Galesburg,
until finally I said,

01:29.714 --> 01:33.468
"Len Bronley, you must do something!"

01:34.177 --> 01:37.305
You're very full of yourself, aren't you?

01:37.388 --> 01:39.099
I do beg your pardon?

01:39.182 --> 01:42.435
No one cares why you're here.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.106
You forgot your lines.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.107
So what?

01:47.190 --> 01:49.984
Maybe you're just growing old.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.488
I was a legend.

01:54.572 --> 01:58.034
A household name all over Europe.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.706
I have played every opera house
from La Scala to the Bolshoi.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.085
I have sung every great soprano role,

02:07.168 --> 02:09.879
from Brünnhilde to Turandot.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.340
I am here…

02:13.842 --> 02:15.718
because I have no choice.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.266
My melancholia…

02:22.934 --> 02:24.686
has gotten the better of me.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.606
I wake up in strange places…

02:30.400 --> 02:33.194
…not knowing how I got there.

02:36.197 --> 02:41.035
When I read about
Dr. Hanover's miracle procedure

02:41.119 --> 02:44.038
in <i>The San Francisco Chronicle, </i>huh…

02:46.374 --> 02:49.210
…I knew I had to give it a chance.

02:50.128 --> 02:55.175
I am hoping the procedure
evens me out a little bit.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.634
Also…

02:59.262 --> 03:01.598
I really need to quit smoking.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.187
Hello.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.438
What's your name?

03:10.690 --> 03:11.524
Peter.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.109
It's nice to meet you, Peter.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.068
I'm Lily.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.532
What brings you to see Dr. Hanover,

03:19.991 --> 03:21.451
if you don't mind me asking?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.036
My mom says I daydream.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.147
Friends.

03:52.273 --> 03:56.736
Today, we stand together
on the precipice of history.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.781
It is truly a momentous day.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.659
Nurse Ratched will get you prepped
while I scrub in.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.743
Here are your gowns.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.331
And a reminder, the procedure
will require some mild sedation.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.667
See you on the other side.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.086
Oh, I nearly forgot.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.506
There will be some observers
in the operating theater today.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.009
Just some government officials
and a reporter.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.220
Nothing for you
to concern yourselves with.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.057
I'm sorry, a reporter?

04:26.557 --> 04:30.186
I was hoping that the details
of my condition would remain confidential.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.771
What? That you're a lesbian?

04:31.854 --> 04:33.398
That much is plain.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.692
It's made obvious
by your facial structure.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.075
I refuse to wear this!

04:44.158 --> 04:46.869
My entire backside will be exposed!

04:46.953 --> 04:49.747
Any glimpse of your backside,
Mr. Bronley, will be brief,

04:49.831 --> 04:53.167
as it would cause even the most hardened
observer to promptly avert their eyes.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.550
Dr. Hanover has asked you to put on
the gowns and prepare to be sedated.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.679
Following the procedure,
you will be woozy.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.681
That's normal.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.935
And there may be some dried blood
at the site of incision.

06:33.059 --> 06:33.893
Sorry I'm late.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.228
Hi, Reggie.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.479
Glad you could make it.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.772
Where's the governor?

06:37.855 --> 06:38.773
Campaign trail.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.108
San Jose this morning.

06:40.191 --> 06:44.070
How is this a major press event
when the governor sends his secretary?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.698
You know full well
that I speak for the governor, Reggie.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.119
And I'm confident you'll find
today's event worth your time.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.161
Oh.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.789
It is already worth my time.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.803
That took forever.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.389
Hello, Mrs. Briggs.

07:11.472 --> 07:15.101
Good morning. Reggie, this, of course,
is Secretary Randall Berglund,

07:15.184 --> 07:17.103
head of the State Detentions Bureau,

07:17.186 --> 07:18.312
and Miss Annie Hardcastle,

07:18.396 --> 07:22.233
administrative Aassistant to the director
of state finance, Stan Powers.

07:24.735 --> 07:28.281
The governor believes this facility
can become a shining example,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.950
not just of what we can accomplish
as a state,

07:31.033 --> 07:32.952
but what we're capable of as a nation.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.664
And now… the main event.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.920
Here's Dr. Hanover,
a visionary who, like the governor,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.715
believes that our correctional system
should do exactly that:

07:45.798 --> 07:47.758
correct rather than penalize.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.722
This is just very exciting.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.224
Nurses, take your seats, please.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.526
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:06.068 --> 08:07.820
you're about to witness history.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.740
I present to you the lobotomy.

08:11.699 --> 08:16.078
In 1935, Portuguese neurologist
António Egas Moniz

08:16.162 --> 08:20.082
first attempted a procedure
that I now wish to make commonplace.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.418
A procedure so straightforward,

08:22.502 --> 08:27.632
it can be performed on all four subjects
in a quarter of an hour.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.760
The brain's frontal lobe
is the seed of its neuroses.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.678
Juvenile distraction,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.263
mania,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.223
memory loss,

08:35.306 --> 08:36.516
lesbianism.

08:37.141 --> 08:41.604
All of these maladies can be subdued,
if not reversed,

08:41.687 --> 08:45.566
by surgically disrupting a series
of neural connections

08:45.650 --> 08:47.068
in the brain's white matter.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.697
As you can see, the patients have received
only the lightest sedation…

08:53.658 --> 08:56.327
and will awaken, though slightly groggy,

08:56.953 --> 08:58.704
as brand-new individuals

08:58.788 --> 09:02.166
unencumbered by the mental illness
that brought them to this place.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.002
Now, I encourage you to sit back,

09:05.711 --> 09:10.007
relax, and bear witness
as I touch the mind.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.094
First, the incision.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.652
You'll notice that
the patient feels nothing.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.282
Next, the trepanning.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.252
Oh, my. Oh, my.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.353
Now, we rotate the instrument,

10:04.437 --> 10:07.064
creating a circular lesion in the brain.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.696
You'll observe that
the subject is still totally insensate.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.370
A reminder that these are
involuntary movements that emerge

10:21.454 --> 10:23.205
as the neural connections are severed.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.292
And the procedure is complete.

10:31.130 --> 10:31.964
Miss Hardcastle!

10:32.757 --> 10:33.883
Reggie, please.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.176
Miss Hardcastle?

10:35.259 --> 10:38.137
Nurse Ratched,
if you could quickly attend to our guest,

10:38.220 --> 10:40.097
I'd like to proceed with today's program.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.435
Now, on to the next patient.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.386
Who are you?

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
A friend.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.269
My name is Mildred Ratched,

12:09.103 --> 12:12.189
and I work with Dr. Hanover
at Lucia State Hospital.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.735
We're housing an inmate there.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.779
Edmund Tolleson.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.073
Do you recognize that name?

12:22.658 --> 12:24.243
Yes...  ...yes, I do.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.996
What do you want with me?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.873
I drove an hour and a half to tell you

12:28.956 --> 12:31.625
that I'm trying to get Mr. Tolleson
fit to stand trial,

12:31.709 --> 12:35.296
so that he can be punished
for what he did to those priests.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.257
And to you, his only surviving victim.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.468
I don't want to talk about this.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.178
I know what you've been through.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.430
About your nervous breakdown.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.223
I don't want to talk about this.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.728
You see, Father…

12:52.521 --> 12:53.898
I'm a Catholic.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.192
But when I read
about what Mr. Tolleson did…

12:58.194 --> 12:59.862
it destroyed my faith.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.158
Help me, Father.

13:04.575 --> 13:08.871
Help me cleanse the Lord's creation
of this evil.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.207
How?

13:13.834 --> 13:17.379
By having an interview with Dr. Hanover
and telling him what you saw.

13:30.559 --> 13:35.898
It is Dr. Hanover's evaluation
that will determine whether Edmund dies.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.362
Or if he's allowed to live out
the rest of his days…

13:43.781 --> 13:48.077
in lavish, extravagant luxury.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.245
No.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.665
No, Church teaching is very clear on this.
I don't believe in…

13:53.791 --> 13:55.835
-putting anyone to death.
-Nor do I.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.171
Except in this case.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.550
We cannot trust the system.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.219
If he is allowed to live,
he will kill again.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.555
I know it.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.683
Please, Father.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.727
Tell Dr. Hanover.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.150
Not only the facts, but how it felt.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.986
I can't.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.239
I've already told the story.

14:27.408 --> 14:31.245
I'm scheduled to… speak
to the state prosecutors in--

14:31.328 --> 14:32.162
When?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.749
In two weeks' time, I'm…

14:36.709 --> 14:39.211
I'm just…
I'm not well enough.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.088
I just can't.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.506
I understand, Father.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.052
Here.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.641
My mother gave this to me
on the morning of my first communion.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.519
And I want you to have it…

14:58.022 --> 15:01.817
so you know there is another child of God
out there who is praying for you.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.402
<i>Why is he building a barn?</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:46.737
I don't understand it.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.738
I have no idea.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.782
Is it to house the patients?

15:49.865 --> 15:51.909
No, it's an actual barn,

15:51.992 --> 15:53.369
with animals.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.955
I mean, it's like a real,
functioning, actual barn.

15:57.581 --> 16:01.377
I overheard Dr. Hanover talking
about buying an Arabian stallion.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.630
So I've looked into getting
riding lessons,

16:04.713 --> 16:08.008
because maybe that's something
he and I could do together.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.469
I haven't found the right teacher yet,
but I will.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.428
Excuse me.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.389
You're eating my peach.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.015
I haven't eaten anything.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.434
All right, you're holding my peach.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.269
-So?
-So it's mine.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.605
The peach in your hand.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.898
I don't see your name on it.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.900
-And who would do that?
-Do what?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.944
Put their name on a peach?

16:27.027 --> 16:28.821
Somebody who really wanted it.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.407
-And how would one go about such a thing?

16:31.865 --> 16:32.700
I don't know.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.410
Felt-tip?

16:34.493 --> 16:37.162
No one has ever put their name on a peach
with a felt-tip.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.956
-I've seen it done.
-No, you haven't.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.125
Maybe a pen.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.169
You could gouge your name into it
with a pen.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.671
That's my peach.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.881
I brought it here.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.383
And I brought it here.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.634
I paid for it.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.386
-Maybe you stole it.
-Maybe I didn't.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.221
Well, what if you did?
Then whose peach is it?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.180
It's still mine.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.516
I don't know.

16:58.267 --> 17:03.439
What I do know is I saw it rolling around
in the icebox, so I brought it here.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.440
So now it's mine.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.233
She kind of does have a point.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.737
I mean, in a situation like this,
the peach is sort of like cash,

17:09.820 --> 17:11.572
so it belongs to whoever is--

17:11.655 --> 17:13.574
No one is talking to you.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.367
Ooh, someone's cranky.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.286
She sure could use a peach.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.787
That is my peach.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.791
No, it's a peach in my mouth.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.252
Sorry.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.587
You are not sorry.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.714
But you will be.

17:28.797 --> 17:29.673
Oh, really?

17:34.511 --> 17:36.847
What? What are you gonna do about it?

17:37.973 --> 17:38.932
What are you, deaf?

17:39.016 --> 17:39.892
No.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.021
I'm just thinking of all the things
I'm going to do about it.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.151
Ladies, your attention, please.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.571
I was appalled by yesterday's surgeries.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.657
The lobotomies did not go at all
how I had hoped,

17:55.741 --> 17:57.451
and I alone am to blame.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.788
Therefore, I will be demonstrating
an alternative procedure

18:00.871 --> 18:03.123
in the operating theater in 15 minutes.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.167
I expect to see you all there.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.762
I obtained these cadavers
from the Oakland County morgue.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.349
Upon viewing the reaction
of our guests yesterday,

18:20.432 --> 18:22.476
I realized the trepanning of the skull

18:22.559 --> 18:25.896
by boring through the sphenoid bone
with a hand drill

18:25.979 --> 18:29.650
might be a bit too graphic
to be accepted by the general public.

18:30.234 --> 18:35.989
I recalled the observations of
the Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.284
He complained that
the prefrontal lobotomy

18:39.368 --> 18:41.954
requires drilling through the skull
at its thickest point,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.373
only to access
the site of the frontal lobe,

18:44.915 --> 18:47.626
while its quivering underbelly
can be more easily accessed

18:47.709 --> 18:50.254
through one of the skull's
thinnest points…

18:51.380 --> 18:52.214
the eye socket.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.423
Oh, no.

18:54.049 --> 18:57.177
Behold… the transorbital lobotomy.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.598
As if designed to comfort
any queasy onlookers,

19:01.682 --> 19:05.227
the procedure benefits from
the everyday nature of its instrument.

19:05.769 --> 19:10.107
A simple tool that John and Jane Q. Public
already have around the home.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.192
An ice pick.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.319
-God…
-Would you stop that?

19:20.576 --> 19:21.410
Wait. Uh--

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
Are you going to stick that in her eye?

19:24.663 --> 19:25.873
Above the eye,

19:25.956 --> 19:29.126
against the thin layer of bone
at the top of the eye socket.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.752
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna be sick.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.879
Just stop.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.506
And we tap the ice pick,

19:34.590 --> 19:37.509
driving it five centimeters
into the frontal lobe.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.764
-Oh, look.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.266
My peach.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.185
I'm sorry.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.978
I'm so sorry.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.982
That is unacceptable!

19:52.900 --> 19:54.610
Are you a nurse, Miss Bucket?

19:54.693 --> 19:56.445
Or a lily-livered hausfrau?

19:56.778 --> 19:59.031
If you don't have the stomach
for a procedure

19:59.114 --> 20:01.450
that could revolutionize
the field of medicine,

20:01.533 --> 20:03.619
perhaps you should find other employment!

20:05.287 --> 20:07.206
Now, go change a goddamn bed pan!

20:07.289 --> 20:08.332
Both of you!

20:21.970 --> 20:25.182
Dr. Hanover, please continue.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.812
The ice pick is driven
through the top of the eye socket.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.243
Once inside…

20:44.868 --> 20:47.246
the ice pick is pivoted 40 degrees…

20:48.997 --> 20:51.458
…then returned to a neutral position,

20:51.792 --> 20:54.044
and driven a further two centimeters.

20:58.173 --> 21:02.427
And pivoted around 30 degrees each side,
cutting outwards…

21:03.303 --> 21:04.263
and inwards.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.975
The sequence is repeated
in the other lobe.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.980
And the procedure is complete,
with no noticeable bleeding.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.481
Simple.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.275
Elegant.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.989
Thank you.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.907
That will be all, you're all dismissed.

21:40.090 --> 21:40.924
Excuse me.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.978
I feel as if I've seen the future.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.314
Oh.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.274
You have.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.152
I'm happy to be sharing this with you,
Mildred.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.880
You're not like those other women.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.299
You're different.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.219
That's something my mother
used to say about me.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.806
And while I don't believe
she meant it as a compliment…

22:31.892 --> 22:33.310
I certainly do.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.070
One thing does occur to me, Dr. Hanover.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.531
The refinement, the…

22:46.615 --> 22:48.992
sophistication of this procedure,

22:49.076 --> 22:52.579
is not reflected in some
of the other practices

22:52.662 --> 22:54.790
in place at this hospital.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.168
There's a patient here, Edmund Tolleson.

22:59.211 --> 23:04.341
While other patients are allowed
to shower under armed guard,

23:04.424 --> 23:05.967
Edmund remains shackled.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.971
<i>Lathered up and hosed down</i>
<i>like a circus animal.</i>

23:13.809 --> 23:15.477
Well, frankly, it seems barbaric.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.309
Hi.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.227
Hi.

23:58.103 --> 23:58.937
Here.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.942
From now on, you'll be allowed to shower
like every other patient here.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.611
Under armed guard, of course, but

24:06.695 --> 24:10.198
you won't be blasted with a fire hose,
and you'll be able to lather up yourself.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.701
I kind of like that part.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.287
I like feeling them soap up my balls.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.539
Don't be vulgar.

24:18.373 --> 24:21.168
This may not seem like much,
but it's a first step.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.170
I'm going to get you out of here.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.131
But you have to control yourself.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.008
Okay?

24:29.426 --> 24:30.260
Okay.

24:30.844 --> 24:31.845
Don't do that.

24:31.928 --> 24:32.888
Mm.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.351
Gate, please.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.500
Hi.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.002
You don't know me.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.962
We haven't been officially introduced.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.589
I know exactly who you are.

25:08.924 --> 25:09.883
Mildred Ratched.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.135
Gwendolyn Briggs.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.638
This is slightly odd.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.431
I put a sack lunch here.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.891
Would someone have thrown it away?

25:17.974 --> 25:19.267
Nurse Bucket ate it.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.020
Ah.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.940
You're welcome to the other half
of my bologna sandwich.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.858
Oh, no, I couldn't. Thank you.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.527
I really don't mind.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.278
No, I mean I don't eat bologna.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.404
Why?

25:32.155 --> 25:34.115
It's perfectly nutritious.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.450
-I'm sure.
-Very filling.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.494
I just don't eat extruded meats.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.703
No offense.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.582
Bologna is my favorite food.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.585
You can't be serious.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.962
I am completely serious.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.389
So are you from the area?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.267
No.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.103
Well, it's a beautiful part of the world.

26:03.186 --> 26:06.606
The views from this stretch of coastline
are simply magnificent.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.068
Yes. I have a lovely view
from where I stay.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.863
Of course, I don't get to see it much.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.782
My work is very stressful,

26:15.865 --> 26:17.576
so I try to go to bed early.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.538
So…

26:22.747 --> 26:24.249
how about you let me show you around?

26:26.918 --> 26:27.752
I'm sorry?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.130
I'm driving down to Monterey
this afternoon.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.757
Would you care to join me?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.884
No. Thank you.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.178
Monterey is nothing but longshoremen

26:37.262 --> 26:39.139
and morphine addicts
trying to sell their poetry.

26:41.808 --> 26:42.851
You sure?

26:43.351 --> 26:44.978
It's a stunner of a drive.

26:45.729 --> 26:49.065
And there's an oyster bar just off Route 1
I've been dying to try.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.191
Oyster bar?

26:50.775 --> 26:51.610
Yeah.

26:58.908 --> 27:01.453
Well, won't there be a gentleman
accompanying you?

27:02.454 --> 27:03.288
No.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.167
<i>Come on, it'll be an adventure.</i>

27:23.183 --> 27:26.144
"Brutal" is the word
that kept running through my mind.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.563
This procedure is sadistic,

27:28.647 --> 27:31.483
and Governor Wilburn is staking
his entire reelection on it,

27:31.566 --> 27:35.028
something that I don't know
that voters are able to accept.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.821
Then the voters are foolish.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.824
- Hm.
-Dr. Hanover is a true genius.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.452
The governor is wise
to be following his lead.

27:43.953 --> 27:44.788
Enjoy.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.623
Thank you.

27:48.958 --> 27:49.793
I, um…

27:53.505 --> 27:55.632
I'm not sure
how I'm even meant to do this.

27:57.050 --> 27:57.884
Well…

27:58.802 --> 28:00.303
allow me to demonstrate.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.099
First, a few drops of lemon.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.897
Then you take this little fork…

28:11.898 --> 28:16.111
and loosen the oyster from his shell.

28:18.238 --> 28:22.325
Then cocktail sauce, if you're a boor
who likes hookers and cigars.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.288
I prefer just a splash of mignonette.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.500
And then…

28:31.501 --> 28:33.503
you just let it slide into your mouth.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.214
It's like making love to the ocean.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.179
Mm.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.813
I'm sorry, I think the fact
that it's still alive as you eat it is--

28:51.896 --> 28:52.731
Here.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.316
Let me help you.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.031
Just… open your lips.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.500
Now swallow.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.013
It's tasty.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.189
So you believe in it?

29:35.565 --> 29:36.399
What?

29:36.483 --> 29:37.692
The lobotomy.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.028
You really believe in it?

29:40.111 --> 29:43.448
If it does what they say it does,
yes, absolutely.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.578
A disordered mind cannot ease
its own suffering.

29:48.661 --> 29:53.124
A person can be burdened
by certain impulses and drives…

29:54.167 --> 29:55.877
that are destroying their lives.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.757
But then aren't we playing God?

30:01.508 --> 30:04.469
Aren't we saying
there's one feeling that's right,

30:04.552 --> 30:05.845
and another feeling that's wrong?

30:05.929 --> 30:10.308
Well, there are rights
and there are wrongs, Mrs. Briggs.

30:10.725 --> 30:11.893
I believe that.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.229
I believe it because I've seen it.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.864
I believe there are some things
that are worse to feel

30:24.948 --> 30:26.616
than simply feeling nothing.

30:29.077 --> 30:29.911
You know what?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.039
I could go for a nightcap.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.542
What do you say?

30:39.087 --> 30:41.214
Yes. I would like that.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.428
- I think I want another one.
-Do you?

30:47.512 --> 30:48.346
I do!

31:08.324 --> 31:10.410
Are you sure you know where you're going?

31:31.598 --> 31:32.932
What is this place?

31:33.016 --> 31:35.643
Oh, it's just…
a little hole in the wall.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.271
Relax.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.648
It's an adventure, remember?

31:44.319 --> 31:45.695
Well, this is lovely.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.031
Isn't it?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.408
What'll you have? It's on me.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.243
Oh, I don't know, just…

32:10.803 --> 32:12.388
I'm sorry. I have to go.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.433
Mildred!

32:16.267 --> 32:17.477
Mildred, come on.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.313
-Mildred, what is the matter?
-What is this place?!

32:21.564 --> 32:22.732
It's a women's bar.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.025
Why did you bring me here?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.652
I asked you if you wanted a nightcap.

32:25.735 --> 32:28.237
No, why did you bring me <i>here</i>?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.992
Because I thought you were one of us.

32:34.535 --> 32:35.578
One of <i>you</i>?

32:37.497 --> 32:39.207
I don't even know what that means.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.333
I think you do.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.005
And what would have given you
that impression?

32:47.423 --> 32:48.508
Aren't you married?

32:50.551 --> 32:51.636
Look, I'm sorry.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.057
I'm sorry if I… made an assumption.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.645
It seemed quite clear to me
what was going on between us,

33:00.728 --> 33:04.607
but I understand if that's not something
you're ready to face yet.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.861
I don't like what you're insinuating,
Mrs. Briggs,

33:08.945 --> 33:10.405
and I don't like your tone.

33:10.905 --> 33:11.781
All right, fine.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.950
I'm sorry. Let's just go.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.660
No, thank you,
I will find my own way home.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.662
Mildred, don't be ridiculous.
I'll drive you home.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.831
I will ask the bartender
to call me a taxi.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.249
-Do not touch me!
-Mildred--

33:44.188 --> 33:45.148
Hello, Edmund.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.691
Thank you, Harold.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.277
You can unshackle his hands
and wait outside the door.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.236
My pleasure, sir.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.156
Mm. I don't want to miss dinner.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.742
They keep taking me away,
and when I come back,

33:55.825 --> 33:58.286
they say I already ate,
but I didn't get nothing, you know?

33:58.369 --> 34:00.705
And that's not fair
'cause everybody else already ate.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.794
Take a seat, Edmund.

34:16.054 --> 34:16.888
Here?

34:24.687 --> 34:26.272
How are you feeling today, Edmund?

34:26.355 --> 34:29.776
Oh, just real warm, I guess,
'cause I'm feeling a little nervous.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.612
Well, Edmund,
there's nothing to be nervous about.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.697
I'm just here to get to know you.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.699
Okay, yeah, but lots of the times
folks say that,

34:36.783 --> 34:38.618
and then they try to read your mind.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.369
That's why I'm so nervous, and…

34:40.870 --> 34:43.790
that window's got a migraine,
and it's giving me one too.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.502
Those ladies at the A&P,
they were always trying to read my mind.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.253
-That's why I killed them.
-Who?

34:50.171 --> 34:51.798
Uh, those girls you say I killed.

34:51.881 --> 34:55.051
Maybe I did on account of them trying to
switch my thoughts around behind my back.

34:55.134 --> 34:58.346
I'm sorry, what girls are you meant
to have killed, Edmund?

34:58.429 --> 34:59.889
Those girls you say I killed.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.974
They all lived together in a house.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.562
They were ballet dancers,
and I followed them inside.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.732
Says to 'em, "I ain't gonna kill you,"
but then you says I did kill them, so…

35:09.816 --> 35:10.775
Edmund.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.277
Those were four men you murdered.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.071
They were priests.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.117
See, this is what I'm talking about.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.036
That's why I gotta talk to the dentist.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.038
Why would you need to see a dentist,
Edmund?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.414
Because I got radio mouth.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.376
I got radio mouth real bad, a bad case.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.837
And you're listening in too.
I heard your voice before.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.797
You're listening in
and whispering these numbers,

35:32.880 --> 35:35.049
but you don't know I can hear you
'cause the antenna's so good.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.551
What is "radio mouth"?

35:36.634 --> 35:37.969
Well, see, I told them all before.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.013
These guys come into the rooming
house where's I was staying,

35:41.097 --> 35:43.641
four or five of 'em, they said,
"We want to sell you something,"

35:43.724 --> 35:45.101
and I said, "I got a bus to catch,"

35:45.184 --> 35:47.770
and then one of them said,
"Well, we already put it in there."

35:47.854 --> 35:49.105
And they showed me.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.859
And they put a little, tiny,
metal radio antenna under my back teeth,

35:52.942 --> 35:54.235
right behind the gums,

35:54.318 --> 35:57.363
and then when I'm sleeping,
these wires come out of my mouth

35:57.446 --> 36:00.449
here, here, and here, and here.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.201
-And back here.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.581
The landlady downstairs says, "No, we took
those out while you were sleeping."

36:06.664 --> 36:09.834
But I says, "Well, how come I keep pulling
wires out of my mouth, then?"

36:09.917 --> 36:10.751
You know?

36:11.586 --> 36:13.462
And she… she has one too.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.007
They give 'em little receivers,
they tell 'em not to tell me,

36:16.090 --> 36:18.593
they listen to what I'm thinking,
then they switch it all around,

36:18.676 --> 36:21.345
and then they sell it…
to somebody else in the organization.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.472
-So it goes on and on and on.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.188
Let's sit somewhere more comfortable,
Edmund.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.148
Okay.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.080
I'm sorry, people listen to your thoughts

36:48.164 --> 36:50.625
as you have them, and change them?

36:50.708 --> 36:53.753
Mm-hm, mm-hm. They're doing it right now,
'cause it tingles.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.517
And who do you think
is changing your thoughts right now?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.269
I think it's the army.

37:11.020 --> 37:11.854
Edmund.

37:12.772 --> 37:17.151
The person I see before me exhibits
multiple symptoms of schizophrenia,

37:17.235 --> 37:21.781
or perhaps schizoaffective mood disorder
with psychotic features.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.742
You're experiencing
paranoid hallucinations,

37:24.825 --> 37:27.787
both auditory and tactile.

37:27.870 --> 37:32.583
Your delirium, the dementia,
your grossly disorganized speech,

37:32.667 --> 37:34.794
the delusion of thought-broadcasting.

37:34.877 --> 37:39.382
Your fears of an inchoate, unseen
conspiracy plotting against you.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.176
These are all prototypical features
of schizophrenia.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.844
Mm-hm, well, okay. Sure.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.144
They're somewhat too prototypical,
actually.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.774
So perfectly presented,
they actually strain credulity.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.660
Could I have a cigarette?

38:10.371 --> 38:12.748
Well, see, Edmund,
I don't believe you're schizophrenic,

38:12.832 --> 38:15.668
despite the show
you're so adeptly putting on.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.841
And I also don't believe
in the death penalty.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.428
It's barbaric, ineffective as a deterrent,

38:25.511 --> 38:28.306
and it debases the moral character
of our society.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.642
It's a cause of social dysfunction,
not a solution to it.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.521
I've seen crimes so heinous
they beggar the imagination,

38:35.604 --> 38:39.066
but not one that I felt
warranted state-sanctioned murder.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.235
I believe that the human mind can crack.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.780
I believe a person can snap
when experiencing certain stimuli,

38:44.864 --> 38:45.740
specific traumas.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.951
A person can quite literally lose control

38:49.035 --> 38:52.288
and commit unspeakable acts
of violence and depravity.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.460
They can rape and mutilate one priest,
stab another,

38:57.543 --> 39:01.339
shatter the skull of a third,
and nearly decapitate a fourth,

39:01.422 --> 39:04.508
and still they are not necessarily insane,

39:04.592 --> 39:07.553
nor are they beyond rehabilitation.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.439
You're not fooling me, Edmund.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.942
I can help you,

39:22.026 --> 39:23.861
but you have to help me.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.074
You want to help me?

39:28.407 --> 39:29.367
Yes.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.577
But you're going about this wrong.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.122
I can keep you out of the gas chamber,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.708
but you have to start
being honest with me.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.712
I need to know about the moment of rage.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.506
What caused you to snap.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.841
I don't want to be in this room anymore.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.511
I think someone's trying to come in
through the window.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.139
-Harold.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.486
Think about what I said, Edmund.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.253
And are you experiencing
any physical discomfort?

40:29.343 --> 40:30.177
Peter?

40:34.014 --> 40:34.932
Yes?

40:35.015 --> 40:36.142
Any pain?

40:40.604 --> 40:41.439
No.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.482
"No, ma'am."

40:44.358 --> 40:47.987
And are you experiencing
any of the symptoms that brought you here?

40:49.363 --> 40:50.656
Scattered thoughts?

40:51.323 --> 40:52.408
Distraction?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.788
I don't have any thoughts at all.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.014
Get out!

41:32.907 --> 41:33.824
Hey, Ratched.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.826
Private call on line three.

41:35.910 --> 41:36.994
Who is it?

41:37.077 --> 41:40.289
I'm not your secretary.
Pick up the phone and ask them yourself.

41:42.541 --> 41:43.375
<i>Hello?</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:46.587
<i>I got your flowers.</i>
<i>They're wonderful.</i>

41:47.588 --> 41:48.756
Father Andrews.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.674
They really brighten up the room.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.468
Well, I'm just delighted to hear that.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.761
<i>I hope you know</i>

41:53.844 --> 41:56.680
your faith is very inspiring to me,
Mildred.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.475
Is there something I can help you with?

41:59.558 --> 42:00.809
I'll tell my story.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.437
Tell you what I saw.

42:05.856 --> 42:06.815
<i>Are you sure?</i>

42:11.779 --> 42:12.780
Yes, I'm sure.

42:13.364 --> 42:17.243
<i>That monster… needs… to be punished.</i>

42:17.576 --> 42:18.786
<i>He must be put away.</i>

42:19.954 --> 42:21.163
<i>Forever.</i>

42:21.247 --> 42:22.081
Very well.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.167
I know just the place.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.772
Dr. Hanover will be the only one
with access to this information.

42:49.108 --> 42:49.942
Thank you.

43:01.203 --> 43:02.705
Tell me what you remember, Father.

43:07.626 --> 43:08.919
Did you see his face?

43:11.213 --> 43:12.214
Edmund Tolleson?

43:18.596 --> 43:21.056
Would you recognize it if you saw him?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.774
From under the bed,
I couldn't see his face.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.279
I watched… him…

43:36.155 --> 43:37.740
mutilate the monsignor.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.413
It seemed like it took hours.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.172
To calm your nerves.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.185
Then suddenly I realized he was gone.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.026
I knew that they were dead.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.030
<i>I went to get help.</i>

44:26.914 --> 44:28.415
That's when I saw his face.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.715
<i>Standing there, smoking.</i>

44:37.841 --> 44:39.635
<i>Just staring at me.</i>

44:42.805 --> 44:44.139
And then he just walked away.

44:44.223 --> 44:46.308
He didn't-- he didn't--
he didn't even run.

44:48.185 --> 44:51.021
Oh, God.
What if I'm next?

44:52.940 --> 44:54.233
Finish your tea, Father.

44:58.779 --> 44:59.613
That's it.

45:02.408 --> 45:03.534
Finish it up, now.

45:10.999 --> 45:11.917
Mm.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.835
Good.

45:24.471 --> 45:25.764
I don't feel so well.

45:28.684 --> 45:31.019
It's all right, Father. Easy, now.

45:34.773 --> 45:36.066
You've seen too much.

45:37.484 --> 45:38.610
You're suffering.

45:42.156 --> 45:42.990
Easy.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.792
I'm going to relieve that suffering.

46:17.483 --> 46:18.734
You see, Father…

46:20.778 --> 46:22.613
Edmund Tolleson is my brother.

46:25.407 --> 46:26.992
He wasn't born a monster.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.704
Somebody turned him into one.

46:46.845 --> 46:48.222
God bless you, Father.

46:51.141 --> 46:54.812
He took a weekend trip
with a young woman several weeks ago,

46:54.895 --> 46:57.439
and ever since
he just hasn't been himself,

46:57.523 --> 46:59.107
but he's much more serene.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.902
The night terrors have stopped,
and he's put on some weight,

47:01.985 --> 47:03.946
so we do feel like he's progressing.

47:04.029 --> 47:04.863
Right this way.

47:10.077 --> 47:13.580
Father Andrews,
we're from the state attorney's office.

47:14.039 --> 47:17.334
We're representing the people
in the Edmund Tolleson murders.

47:18.877 --> 47:21.255
We need you to provide an affidavit.

47:22.422 --> 47:23.799
Do you know what that is?

47:36.979 --> 47:39.064
Father Andrews, can you hear us?

47:42.276 --> 47:45.279
Let's go.
We're not gonna get anything out of him.

47:45.779 --> 47:47.698
Sister, could you show us out?
