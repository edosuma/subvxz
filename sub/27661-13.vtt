- I-I have to make a call.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.422
- Oh go ahead, it'll give me a
chance to get a hold of myself.

18:57.422 --> 18:59.297
They have chicken and waffles!

18:59.297 --> 19:01.130
There goes my entire plan.

19:02.547 --> 19:04.630
(Phone rings)

19:04.630 --> 19:06.005
(Door slams shut)

19:06.005 --> 19:08.005
(Phone buzzes)

19:10.547 --> 19:12.463
- Hello?
- We got Tru Air?

19:12.463 --> 19:14.213
- Hell yeah, we did.

19:14.213 --> 19:15.797
(Chuckles) It's ours!

19:15.797 --> 19:17.380
<i> I tried calling you earlier.</i>

19:17.380 --> 19:19.047
- Wait, but Victoria--
- Went nuts?

19:19.047 --> 19:20.963
Yeah, they told her
like an hour ago.

19:20.963 --> 19:24.213
She flipped out on them.
- Wow.

19:24.213 --> 19:25.922
<i> - Yeah, job's ours.</i>

19:25.922 --> 19:28.380
Contingent on us working
together, of course.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.255
But I told them that wasn't
gonna be a problem.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.172
Are you okay?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.630
- Yeah, I guess
I'm just shocked.

19:34.630 --> 19:37.130
I mean, last night was--
- Yeah.

19:37.130 --> 19:40.297
<i> Yeah, listen about that,</i>

19:40.297 --> 19:42.047
<i>I've got a proposition for you.</i>

19:42.047 --> 19:43.713
- Kate, what do you want?

19:45.088 --> 19:46.422
I don't wanna pick for ya.

19:46.422 --> 19:48.838
- Just uh, just gimme a sec!

19:48.838 --> 19:50.297
- I'm on my way to Cabo
right now,

19:50.297 --> 19:52.088
and I want you to come meet me.
- Wait, what?

19:52.088 --> 19:53.755
You mean for work?

19:53.755 --> 19:55.713
- Well, I mean, I guess we
could get some work done.

19:55.713 --> 19:58.130
(Chuckles) I was thinking
it would be more for us.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.755
<i> Take advantage of the perks</i>
<i> of the job.</i>

19:59.755 --> 20:01.880
- Oh my God.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.797
<i> - Come meet me, Kate.</i>

20:03.797 --> 20:05.338
- Kate, what about a family
pack?

20:05.338 --> 20:06.797
It comes with a Bundt cake.

20:06.797 --> 20:09.213
- Kinda fun, right?

20:09.213 --> 20:11.588
- Too much? No Bundt cake?

20:11.588 --> 20:13.338
Okay, I-I'll figure it out.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.005
- Hello?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.422
Kate, you there?

20:16.422 --> 20:18.213
- Yeah, no I am. I am.

20:18.213 --> 20:20.255
- What, do you not want this,
too?

20:20.255 --> 20:22.047
- I just--

20:22.047 --> 20:24.255
I don't know that I can
give you what you need.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.880
- Listen, I don't need
to be taken care of.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.463
I'm good.

20:29.463 --> 20:31.797
But I do think that we would
be good together.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.922
<i> And I'd like to see you happy.</i>

20:33.922 --> 20:36.005
<i> I can definitely do better</i>
<i> than your current situation.</i>

20:36.005 --> 20:37.838
- Are you pitching me
right now?

20:37.838 --> 20:39.713
- Yeah, you gonna tell me
it's not a good pitch?

20:39.713 --> 20:41.588
- No.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.630
- So what's it gonna be?

20:43.630 --> 20:45.713
[Nathan] Kate, what's it gonna
be? Come on!

20:45.713 --> 20:48.422
- Oh, I uh, I, I don't know.

20:48.422 --> 20:49.963
- Kate, come meet me.

20:49.963 --> 20:51.922
- I'll get you anything
