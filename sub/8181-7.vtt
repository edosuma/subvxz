02:25.644 --> 02:27.478
SUGAR CREEK DOESN'T

02:41.944 --> 02:42.643
EITHER WAY, DON'T CALL.

YOU KNOW WHY?
NO ARBY'S.

03:58.804 --> 04:00.387

04:27.766 --> 04:29.751
WELL, YOU MUST BE TIRED

04:29.819 --> 04:31.385
SO LET'S GET YOU

04:32.454 --> 04:33.955
I PUT YOU IN NUMBER 7.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.524
I HOPE YOU LIKE
ANTIQUE DOLLS.

04:36.592 --> 04:38.827
I DO, JUST AS LONG
AS THEIR EYES CLOSE.

04:48.670 --> 04:52.023
PEOPLE WERE A LOT
SMALLER A LONG TIME AGO.

04:58.347 --> 04:59.531
HERE WE ARE.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.100
HUH? HUH?!

05:03.168 --> 05:04.369
OH, IT'S ADORABLE.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.903
OH, LOOK! A FIREPLACE!

05:05.971 --> 05:07.939
ACTUALLY, WE HAD
TO SEAL THAT UP.

05:08.006 --> 05:09.474
THE SQUIRRELS WOULD
CRAWL IN THERE

05:09.542 --> 05:11.543
AND GET TRAPPED
IN THE FLUE

05:11.610 --> 05:12.359
AND THEN, WELL...

05:12.511 --> 05:14.712

HAD PLENTY OF TOWELS.

05:19.434 --> 05:20.968
AND IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING,

05:21.036 --> 05:21.969
I WOULD-

05:22.037 --> 05:22.970
OH!

05:27.709 --> 05:28.593
ED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:28.661 --> 05:31.262
I TOLD YOU
WE HAD GUESTS COMING.

05:31.329 --> 05:33.098
WELL, THEY'RE EARLY.

05:33.165 --> 05:36.567
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST USE
THE SHOWER DOWNSTAIRS?

05:36.635 --> 05:38.002
YOU KNOW THAT
DOCTOR TOLD ME

05:38.070 --> 05:40.004
I'M SUPPOSED
TO SOAK IT.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.674
WELL, JUST GET OUT.

05:43.742 --> 05:45.376
ALL RIGHT.

05:45.444 --> 05:46.644

05:46.711 --> 05:47.645
ED SEEMED NICE.

05:47.712 --> 05:48.896

05:50.048 --> 05:51.065
YES.
YEAH.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.018
SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

05:54.086 --> 05:55.019
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

05:55.087 --> 05:56.987
THAT'S MY HUSBAND ED. AH!

05:57.056 --> 05:58.006
WELL, ANYHOO,

05:58.073 --> 05:59.290
DINNER'S AT 5:00,

05:59.358 --> 06:00.891
AND THEN OUT COME
THE BOARD GAMES.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.026
I HOPE YOU TWO
AREN'T SHY,

06:02.094 --> 06:03.227
BECAUSE ED AND ME

06:03.295 --> 06:05.829
PLAY A MEAN GAME
OF BALDERDASH.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.833
BALDERDASH.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.735
THAT WASN'T EVEN
IN THE BROCHURE.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.390
YOU DO LIKE IT HERE,
RIGHT?

06:15.457 --> 06:16.391
YEAH.

06:16.458 --> 06:17.892
IT'S FINE.

06:17.959 --> 06:18.843
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:18.994 --> 06:21.095
I LOVE YOU FOR
THINKING OF IT.

06:26.534 --> 06:28.636
NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

06:36.027 --> 06:37.962
THEN GENERAL PATTON
TURNED TO ME AND SAID,

06:38.029 --> 06:40.565
"THAT'S THE BEST DAMN
CUP OF COFFEE I EVER HAD.

06:40.632 --> 06:43.267
NOW, LET'S WIN THIS WAR."

06:43.335 --> 06:44.568
OH, ARTHUR.

06:44.637 --> 06:48.006
I MEAN, WHAT AN
- WHAT AN AMAZING LIFE YOU'VE LED.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.607
I GO WHERE
THE STARS NEED ME.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.976
NOW, LET ME FRESHEN
YOUR GRASSHOPPER.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.011
OH.

06:56.098 --> 06:57.698
WOULD YOU
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT?

07:02.470 --> 07:03.821
HEY, ARTHUR...

07:05.791 --> 07:06.791
HEY!

07:10.111 --> 07:11.762
WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON
IN THERE, MY MAN?

07:11.830 --> 07:12.763
I BOUGHT HER DINNER.

07:12.831 --> 07:13.764
I'M GETTING HER
LIQUORED UP.

07:13.832 --> 07:14.832
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON?

07:14.899 --> 07:15.833
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

07:15.900 --> 07:16.867
I'LL GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.102
LOOK, CARRIE SAID
YOU NEEDED SOME MILK,

07:18.170 --> 07:19.103
SO...

07:19.171 --> 07:20.104
ALL RIGHT.

07:20.172 --> 07:20.971
HEY...

07:21.039 --> 07:22.723
PLAY ON, PLAYER.

07:25.294 --> 07:26.644
WHO WAS THAT?

07:26.712 --> 07:28.179
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

07:28.246 --> 07:29.246
NOW THEY GIVE YOU MILK.

07:29.314 --> 07:30.815
LIKE THAT'S GONNA
TURN ME AROUND.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.385
ARTHUR, IT'S-
IT'S GETTING LATE.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.020
I THINK I SHOULD BE GOING.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.188
NO, NO.

07:37.255 --> 07:39.039
I WANT YOU TO HEAR
ROBERT MITCHUM

07:39.107 --> 07:40.875
"SINGS CALYPSO."

07:40.942 --> 07:42.910
IT'S POSITIVELY SAVAGE.

07:42.978 --> 07:44.111
OH.

07:44.179 --> 07:47.065
BUT WON'T YOUR CHILDREN
BE HOME SOON?

07:47.132 --> 07:47.881
WHAT?

07:47.949 --> 07:48.966
CHILDREN?

07:50.035 --> 07:51.069
I LIVE ALONE.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.303
OH, WELL, J-

07:52.370 --> 07:54.538
JOSEPHINE TOLD ME
THAT, UM...

07:54.606 --> 07:56.874
THAT THIS HOUSE
BELONGS TO

07:56.942 --> 07:58.876
YOUR DAUGHTER
AND SON-IN-LAW.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.311
JOSEPHINE
ALSO THINKS

08:00.379 --> 08:02.613
HER FISH STICKS
TALK TO HER.

08:04.717 --> 08:05.650
HA HA.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.585
NO, NO. I-
I LIVE ALONE.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.904
OH, WELL, I THINK
I SHOULD BE GOING.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.089
UH, UH-

08:11.156 --> 08:12.724
PLEASE, ANNETTE,

08:12.791 --> 08:13.474
IT GETS SO LONELY

08:13.541 --> 08:16.994
IN THIS BIG,
COMPLETELY-PAID-OFF HOUSE.

08:17.062 --> 08:18.429
AND...

08:18.497 --> 08:21.566
YOUR LAUGHTER HAS
MADE IT COME ALIVE.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.486
I DON'T WANT
THAT TO END.

08:25.553 --> 08:27.271
OH, WELL...

08:27.338 --> 08:29.874
THERE IS A...

08:29.942 --> 08:31.609
MIDNIGHT BUS.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.434
SO, WHEN ARE THE REST OF
THE GUESTS COMING DOWN?

08:57.502 --> 08:58.853
OH, YOU TWO
ARE IT.

09:02.474 --> 09:03.574
FOR THE WHOLE
WEEKEND?

09:03.642 --> 09:04.742
MM-HMM.

09:04.810 --> 09:05.977
YEAH, IT'S BEEN
LIKE THIS

09:06.044 --> 09:08.646
EVER SINCE THEY OPENED
THAT DAMN HYATT.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.115
THERE'S A HYATT?

09:13.018 --> 09:13.767
YEAH, RIGHT OVER THERE

09:13.919 --> 09:15.653
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WOODS.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.722
IT'S A DISGRACE.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.090
THEY EVEN TORE DOWN
THE SMELTING PLANT

09:20.158 --> 09:23.160
JUST TO ADD
A LUXURY SPA.

09:24.446 --> 09:25.613
A SPA?

09:27.382 --> 09:28.482
WHAT'S UP?

09:30.685 --> 09:32.987
MARMALADE REALLY
LIKES YOU, DOUG.

09:33.055 --> 09:33.755
HE DOES?

09:33.822 --> 09:35.239
IS THERE AN AREA
WHERE HE EATS?

09:35.307 --> 09:37.775
OR, YOU KNOW...

09:37.843 --> 09:39.977
YOU KNOW WHY MARMALADE
LIKES HIM SO MUCH,

09:40.045 --> 09:40.978
DON'T YOU?

09:41.046 --> 09:42.346
WHO DOES DOUG
LOOK JUST LIKE?

09:42.414 --> 09:43.380
I DON'T KNOW.

09:43.448 --> 09:44.782
YES, YOU DO.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.583
DOUG IS
THE SPITTING IMAGE

09:46.651 --> 09:47.651
OF ED JUNIOR.

09:47.719 --> 09:49.120
WELL, THAT'S
OUR SON.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.487
DOES ED JUNIOR HAVE
THE SAME APPETITE

09:50.555 --> 09:51.956
THIS ONE'S GOT?

09:52.024 --> 09:53.824
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
ED JUNIOR.

09:53.892 --> 09:54.641
OK.

09:57.128 --> 09:59.646
WHEN HE WALKED OUT
OF HERE 12 YEARS AGO,

09:59.714 --> 10:02.216
WE STOPPED HAVING A SON.

10:02.284 --> 10:03.567
ED!

10:03.635 --> 10:05.102
BETTY.
ED!

10:05.170 --> 10:06.203
BETTY!

10:08.740 --> 10:10.308
WHAT'S UP WITH
THAT LAST DRUMSTICK?

10:10.375 --> 10:11.342
OH.

10:11.409 --> 10:12.794
COMING RIGHT UP.

10:12.861 --> 10:14.429
IT'S NOT TOO DRY THEN?

10:14.496 --> 10:15.430
OH,
IT'S DELICIOUS.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.264
OH. I'M SO RELIEVED.

10:17.332 --> 10:20.935
YOU KNOW, THIS TURKEY WAS
STILL FROZEN THIS MORNING.

10:21.002 --> 10:23.971
SO, I HAD TO PUT IT
IN THE TUB UPSTAIRS

10:24.039 --> 10:25.589
TO DEFROST.

10:40.655 --> 10:41.889
UGH!

10:41.957 --> 10:44.992
I AM STILL TASTING
THAT TURKEY.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.493
I'M STILL TASTING ED.

10:52.267 --> 10:53.534
WELL, WE...

10:53.601 --> 10:54.635
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAD DOWNSTAIRS.

10:54.702 --> 10:56.170
WHAT?

10:56.238 --> 10:57.838
WE GOT CHUTES AND LADDERS
IN 5 MINUTES.

11:00.676 --> 11:02.360
CHUTES AND LADDERS?

11:02.427 --> 11:03.828
DOUG, THE ONLY
LADDER I WANT TO SEE

11:03.929 --> 11:05.529
IS THE ONE THAT'S GETTING
ME OUT THAT WINDOW.

11:05.597 --> 11:06.730
OH, COME-

11:06.798 --> 11:08.315
COME ON, SO WE HAD
A LITTLE TUB TURKEY.

11:08.383 --> 11:10.400
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY
AND MOVE PAST IT.

11:10.468 --> 11:11.051
WHAT ARE YOU-
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:11.119 --> 11:13.036
YOU ACTUALLY WANT
TO STAY HERE?

11:13.104 --> 11:15.139
I WANTED THIS WHOLE WEEKEND
TO BE GREAT FOR YOU.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.291
AND IT CAN BE GREAT,
HONEY...

11:17.359 --> 11:19.493
AT THE HYATT.

11:28.403 --> 11:29.971
DOUG, IS THAT YOU?

11:32.841 --> 11:34.641
YEAH, UH, FIRST OFF,

11:34.709 --> 11:36.143
JUST, I WANT-
LOVE THAT PLACE!

11:36.211 --> 11:37.945
AND WE LOVE HAVING YOU.

11:38.013 --> 11:39.746
YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

11:39.814 --> 11:42.383
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

11:42.451 --> 11:44.085
THE WAY BUSINESS
HAS BEEN,

11:44.152 --> 11:45.186
ED AND ME THOUGHT

11:45.253 --> 11:47.388
WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO
SHUT DOWN FOR SURE.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.992
AND THEN GOD HAS SENT US
YOU AND CARRIE-

11:51.059 --> 11:54.161
OUR TWO ANGELS...

11:54.229 --> 11:55.796
GIVING US HOPE.

12:11.746 --> 12:13.914
OK, come on.
She's sleeping.

12:17.368 --> 12:18.602
Shh!

12:27.346 --> 12:28.646
Ooh!

12:32.985 --> 12:33.917
Ooh!

12:33.986 --> 12:36.287
Shh!

12:36.355 --> 12:37.288
Oh.

12:48.183 --> 12:50.334
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

12:50.402 --> 12:52.920
I have a splinter
in a bad place.

12:54.839 --> 12:55.772
Crap!

12:55.840 --> 12:58.109
Their stupid truck
is blocking us.

12:58.176 --> 12:59.743
HUH?!

12:59.811 --> 13:02.129
SOMEBODY OUT THERE?!

13:02.196 --> 13:03.314
Let's go.
Let's just go.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.715
What about the car?

13:04.783 --> 13:05.916
We'll get a new one.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.254
How far
is this place?

13:10.322 --> 13:11.255
I don't know.

13:11.323 --> 13:12.657
Just a little
further this way.

13:12.724 --> 13:13.658
How much farther?

13:13.725 --> 13:14.692
I don't know.

13:14.759 --> 13:15.893
Would you just
stop talking?

13:17.996 --> 13:19.129
What is wrong with you?

13:20.666 --> 13:21.999
SERIOUSLY,
I NEED TWEEZERS

13:22.067 --> 13:23.668
AND A SMALL MIRROR.

13:23.735 --> 13:24.669
DOUG, COME ON.

13:24.736 --> 13:26.170
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.572
I SEE LIGHTS
FROM THE HOTEL.

13:27.639 --> 13:28.673
COME ON.

13:29.741 --> 13:30.774
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

13:34.246 --> 13:35.813
MARMALADE!

13:35.880 --> 13:37.815
THAT FREAKING CAT
FOLLOWED YOU!

13:37.882 --> 13:39.917
HE THINKS I'M ED JUNIOR.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.519
MARMALADE!

13:41.587 --> 13:43.137
MARMALADE!

13:44.940 --> 13:47.124
OK, COME ON,
LET'S GO.

13:51.963 --> 13:54.031
Oh, crap!

13:58.703 --> 13:59.837
OOF.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.038
I'M OK.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.713
CARRIE!

14:09.781 --> 14:14.718
MARMALADE!

14:18.223 --> 14:19.790
DOUG?

14:19.857 --> 14:20.975
FOUND HER.

14:21.043 --> 14:21.976
NICE GOING!

14:22.127 --> 14:25.329
YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF
A TURKEY SANDWICH.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.757
OH, GOOD MORNING,
ARTHUR.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.025
OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE?

14:57.796 --> 15:01.047
I'M MAKING YOU
SOME EGG BEATERS.

15:01.115 --> 15:02.099
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.400
NOW, LET ME
RETURN THE FAVOR

15:03.468 --> 15:05.002
BY ESCORTING YOU
TO THE BUS.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.170
OH, I'M...

15:06.237 --> 15:07.454
I'M IN NO RUSH.

15:07.522 --> 15:09.323
ANNETTE, NO ONE
LOOKS FORWARD TO

15:09.391 --> 15:10.391
THE WALK OF SHAME,

15:10.458 --> 15:12.159
BUT THE SOONER,
THE BETTER.

15:12.227 --> 15:13.160
OH.

15:14.329 --> 15:16.247
ARTHUR, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT

15:16.315 --> 15:18.782
WHAT YOU ASKED ME
TO DO LAST NIGHT.

15:18.850 --> 15:19.633
AGAIN...

15:19.701 --> 15:21.419
IT WAS MERELY
A SUGGESTION.

15:21.486 --> 15:23.454
WE DID FINE WITHOUT IT.

15:23.522 --> 15:24.254
OH, NO, NO, NO.

15:24.406 --> 15:27.307
WHEN YOU-WHEN YOU SAID
HOW LONELY YOU ARE

15:27.375 --> 15:28.475
IN THIS BIG HOUSE,

15:28.543 --> 15:31.278
AND YOU NEVER WANTED
ME TO LEAVE.

15:31.345 --> 15:33.347
OH, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE CREME DE MENTHE TALKING.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.801
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

15:37.869 --> 15:39.236
YES.

15:39.303 --> 15:42.272
I'LL MOVE IN
WITH YOU.

15:42.991 --> 15:44.341
I...

15:44.409 --> 15:46.009
I- I...

15:46.077 --> 15:48.379
I'M OVERWHELMED.

15:51.099 --> 15:52.950
LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING, DOUG?

15:53.018 --> 15:53.701
OH.

15:53.769 --> 15:55.719
UH, NO, JUST...

15:55.787 --> 15:57.455
CHECKING OUT
YOUR LAWN DWARVES.

15:57.522 --> 15:59.323
UH...

16:00.459 --> 16:01.592
WE WERE THINKING
OF GETTING SOME.

16:01.659 --> 16:02.860
YOU HAPPY WITH 'EM?

16:02.927 --> 16:04.428
I GUESS.

16:05.897 --> 16:08.165
HERE'S YOUR TOAST,
DOUG.

16:08.233 --> 16:08.849
OH, GREAT.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.567
NOW, ARE YOU SURE
I CAN'T INTEREST YOU

16:10.635 --> 16:12.436
IN A NICE TURKEY OMELET?

16:12.504 --> 16:14.437
NO, I'M STICKING
WITH THE TOAST.

16:14.505 --> 16:16.123
THANKS.

16:16.941 --> 16:19.526
MR. BOOTS,
FOR THE LAST TIME,

16:19.594 --> 16:21.361
STAY OUT OF THE BUTTER!

16:22.380 --> 16:23.447
OH.

16:29.754 --> 16:31.037
SO...

16:31.105 --> 16:33.474
CARRIE STILL HASN'T
COME DOWN YET?

16:33.541 --> 16:34.925
UM, YEAH, SHE'S
UH, YOU KNOW,

16:34.993 --> 16:36.026
PUTTING ON HER FACE.

16:36.094 --> 16:37.261
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THAT TAKES.

16:37.328 --> 16:38.629
HA HA.

16:38.697 --> 16:39.980
WISH THIS ONE WOULD TAKE
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

16:40.047 --> 16:43.217
SHE JUST ROLLS ON DOWN
LOOKING LIKE HELL.

16:45.837 --> 16:47.220
GOOD MORNING!

16:51.443 --> 16:52.276
HI.

16:53.478 --> 16:55.879
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE UPSTAIRS, DEAR.

16:57.131 --> 16:58.732
OH, UH...

16:58.800 --> 17:00.367
YEAH, I JUST-
I GOT UP EARLY,

17:00.435 --> 17:03.170
AND JUST WENT
FOR A WALK.

17:03.237 --> 17:05.321
WELL, YOU'RE JUST
IN TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.508
OH, I JUST-
I ALREADY HAD BREAKFAST.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.077
I, UH,
I PICKED SOME...

17:10.145 --> 17:11.295
SOME BERRIES.

17:15.266 --> 17:18.202
WOULD YOU GUYS
EXCUSE ME...

17:18.269 --> 17:19.301
PLEASE?

17:20.771 --> 17:22.372
WHY CAN'T YOU
DRESS LIKE THAT

17:22.440 --> 17:23.807
TO PICK BERRIES?

17:29.530 --> 17:30.781
OK.

17:30.849 --> 17:31.699
WE CAN TEAR
THE WALL OUT,

17:31.766 --> 17:33.450
GIVE YOU GRANITE
COUNTERTOPS,

17:33.518 --> 17:34.418
A TILE BACKSPLASH,

17:34.485 --> 17:35.585
AND THE ISLAND YOU WANTED.

17:35.653 --> 17:38.588
AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT
FOR UNDER 30,000.

17:38.656 --> 17:39.523
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ARTHUR?

17:39.591 --> 17:40.991
SOUNDS REASONABLE.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.178
UH, PETE,

17:44.329 --> 17:46.096
I WANT YOU TO COME LOOK
AT THE LIVING ROOM.

17:46.164 --> 17:49.566
I'M THINKING WE SHOULD
GUT THE WHOLE THING...

17:51.436 --> 17:53.170
WHAT'S THAT BIG TARP
DOING IN THE BACK YARD?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.805
APPARENTLY, WE'RE
PUTTING IN A GAZEBO.

17:57.675 --> 17:58.942
WHAT?!

17:59.010 --> 17:59.877
OH, HELLO AGAIN!

17:59.945 --> 18:01.061
YEAH, HI.

18:01.128 --> 18:01.995
LOOK-

18:05.166 --> 18:06.783
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

18:06.851 --> 18:09.502
ARTHUR, WHY DOES THIS MAN
KEEP COMING OVER?

18:11.539 --> 18:14.458
TRUTH IS, HE'S MY
PAROLE OFFICER.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.277
WHAT?

18:17.345 --> 18:20.431
I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU
FOR WALKING AWAY RIGHT NOW.

18:20.498 --> 18:21.982
OH, NO, ARTHUR.

18:22.049 --> 18:23.717
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

18:23.785 --> 18:27.755
I CAN TELL YOU'RE
A GOOD MAN AT HEART.

18:27.822 --> 18:29.723
HE'S ALSO...

18:29.791 --> 18:31.308
MY LOVER.

18:36.113 --> 18:37.314
IS THIS TRUE?

18:37.382 --> 18:38.598
YEAH, I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

18:42.019 --> 18:43.603
WELL, IT'S NOT IDEAL.

18:43.671 --> 18:46.089
JUST TRY AND MAKE SURE

18:46.157 --> 18:49.192
HE LEAVES THE HOUSE
BEFORE I GET HOME.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.968
HEY, BABE, WHERE'S
THE BIG SUITCASE?

18:58.036 --> 18:59.269
IT'S IN THE WOODS.

18:59.337 --> 19:00.620
WHY'D YOU LEAVE IT
IN THE WOODS?!

19:00.688 --> 19:03.423
WHY'D YOU LEAVE ME
IN THE WOODS?!

19:03.491 --> 19:05.041
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA CATCH UP.

19:05.109 --> 19:07.077
I WAITED AND WAITED
FOR YOU AT THE HOTEL.

19:07.144 --> 19:09.045
I WAS WORRIED SICK.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.134
WAIT, WHAT'S THAT INK
ON YOUR HAND?

19:14.202 --> 19:15.152
OH, UM...

19:15.303 --> 19:17.837
A PEN EXPLODED
IN MY PURSE.

19:17.905 --> 19:20.758
IT'S A STAMP.
IT SAYS "CLUB NEON."

19:22.260 --> 19:23.993
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

19:24.061 --> 19:25.028
OH, OH!

19:25.096 --> 19:26.029
IT WAS A DISCO...

19:26.097 --> 19:27.564
HA, IN THE HOTEL.

19:27.632 --> 19:28.482
YOU WENT DANCING?!

19:28.549 --> 19:29.799
WELL, DOUG,

19:29.867 --> 19:30.717
ONCE I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T COMING,

19:30.785 --> 19:31.785
WHAT DID YOU
WANT ME TO DO,

19:31.853 --> 19:32.886
STAY IN THAT BIG SUITE
ALL BY MYSELF?

19:32.954 --> 19:33.987
YOU-

19:34.055 --> 19:35.338
YOU GOT A SUITE?!

19:35.407 --> 19:37.207
FINE, YOU KNOW, YEAH.
YOU DESERVE A SUITE.

19:37.275 --> 19:38.409
AFTER A TOUGH NIGHT
OF DANCING,

19:38.476 --> 19:39.743
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
BACK TO A REGULAR ROOM.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.761
OH! HONEY,
COME ON.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.997
WE CAN STILL HAVE
A GREAT WEEKEND.

19:44.065 --> 19:45.098
OK, LOOK.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.166
I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS

19:46.234 --> 19:47.868
AND MAKE UP SOME
EXCUSE TO...

19:47.936 --> 19:50.003
TO CAT LADY
AND TUB BOY

19:50.071 --> 19:51.004
AND WE ARE OUT
OF THIS DUMP

19:51.072 --> 19:52.206
AND INTO THE HYATT!

19:52.273 --> 19:54.074
ALL RIGHT?

19:54.142 --> 19:55.442
NO. NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:55.510 --> 19:57.011
YOU GO TO YOUR
FANCY HOTEL.

19:57.078 --> 19:58.395
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE
WITH ED, BETTY,

19:58.463 --> 20:01.164
AND MARMALADE.

20:01.232 --> 20:03.901
YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY LIKE
ME FOR WHO I AM,

20:03.969 --> 20:05.101
NOT WHERE I CAN TAKE THEM.

20:05.169 --> 20:07.304
THEY THINK...

20:07.371 --> 20:09.272
I'M AN ANGEL.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.746
OK, THERE'S A HAM
FLOATING IN THE BATHTUB.

20:51.265 --> 20:52.332
OH, MY GOD.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.633
ED.
