01:13.770 --> 01:16.200
- Hey, this is great!
- What are you guys doing?

01:16.290 --> 01:19.159
Checking to see
if these ice skates fit Mark.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.760
- So, if he falls out, they don't fit?
- Right.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.260
Put him down.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.240
Randy, come on over here
and help me load up some firewood.

01:27.329 --> 01:31.520
- Your mom's really cold.
- How come Mom is always cold?

01:31.609 --> 01:35.079
Guys, I'm gonna tell you
something about women.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.359
They're always cold.

01:37.450 --> 01:43.319
It's our job as hot-blooded men
to heat the women up.

01:43.409 --> 01:47.599
If men are hot-blooded,
are women cold-blooded?

01:50.970 --> 01:54.319
Out of the mouths of babes.

01:54.409 --> 01:58.240
Hey, Dad, maybe we should get Mom
a heater for her birthday.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.879
Birthday!

01:59.970 --> 02:02.839
- Dad forgot Mom's birthday.
- Did not.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.280
- Did too.
- Did not.

02:05.369 --> 02:08.158
Are we gonna do something special
for her birthday on Saturday?

02:08.250 --> 02:10.759
Yeah, Saturday. Yeah!

02:10.848 --> 02:13.309
Oh! We'll have a big party.

02:13.409 --> 02:16.839
We'll cater some food, her favorite
restaurant, balloons, everything.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.000
- Won't she be disappointed?
- Why?

02:19.089 --> 02:21.550
Her birthday is Friday.

02:25.089 --> 02:28.790
Oh! Honey, this is the season…

02:28.889 --> 02:31.960
Jack frost nipping at my nose.

02:32.050 --> 02:34.760
This is the season
for somebody's birthday.

02:34.849 --> 02:38.079
- You remembered.
- Of course I did.

02:39.530 --> 02:41.879
Which one of the boys told you?

02:41.970 --> 02:45.480
Come on.
Honey, I'm insulted.

02:45.569 --> 02:47.319
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:47.409 --> 02:50.720
You've been so busy at work.
I figured you'd for sure forget.

02:51.930 --> 02:57.359
As a matter of fact
I had to remind the boys
it wasn't Saturday, it was Friday.

02:57.450 --> 02:59.440
It is Saturday.

03:02.290 --> 03:04.319
- Gotcha.
- What?

03:04.409 --> 03:06.680
- It's Friday.

03:07.809 --> 03:09.119
Well…

03:09.210 --> 03:12.319
now that we have
the day established.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.079
Let's move on
into the gift category.

03:15.169 --> 03:17.550
Oh, honey,
you don't have to get me anything.

03:17.649 --> 03:22.319
Let's say I was gonna get you something.
What would you want me to get you?

03:22.409 --> 03:25.800
If I have to tell you what to get.
I might as well go out and buy it myself.

03:25.889 --> 03:28.450
Now you're talking.

03:30.809 --> 03:36.909
You put that money back in your pocket, or
I'll break both your legs. Oh, Tim, come on.

03:37.010 --> 03:41.240
We've been married 12 years and every
year I put a lot of thought into your gift.

03:41.329 --> 03:45.599
I tune in to who you are,
and I get you something you really want.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.069
- I do that, too.
- Oh, yeah?

03:48.169 --> 03:51.599
This is how you tuned in to me last year.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.119
A pressurized window washer?

03:55.530 --> 03:58.760
It shattered a window.

03:58.849 --> 04:02.159
Every piece was clean, though -
all of them.

04:02.849 --> 04:05.879
- What about this thing?
- You never even used it.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.200
I didn't know what it was.
I was afraid it might eat me.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.079
Honey, honey.
It's a de-nubber.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.119
It de.

04:13.210 --> 04:16.440
It de-nubs things,
forget about this thing.

04:16.529 --> 04:21.279
Tim… a gift doesn't have to be
any kind of a big deal.

04:21.369 --> 04:26.440
You should just close your eyes
and think of who I am.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.399
- A tape deck.
- Tim.

04:28.490 --> 04:31.200
A waffle iron.

04:31.290 --> 04:34.319
- Ukulele.
- Stop it.

04:34.409 --> 04:39.760
I want you to get me something thoughtful,
just something from your heart.

04:39.849 --> 04:41.760
Arteries.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.599
We have a special guest
on Tool Time.

04:44.690 --> 04:49.480
As you all know, we're in the midst of our
project house in Keego Harbor Heights.

04:49.569 --> 04:55.800
I've got the owner of the house. Eugene
Ingram. Give him a big grunting welcome.

05:00.290 --> 05:03.319
- Hi. Eugene. How you doin'?
- Just call me Ink.

05:03.409 --> 05:06.200
My friends all call me Ink.

05:08.129 --> 05:10.280
Ink, you live up there
in Keego Harbor Heights…

05:10.369 --> 05:13.440
That's right.
We're a planned community.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.909
48 peas in a pod.

05:16.889 --> 05:21.879
Right. And we're gonna make
your pod a little more distinctive

05:21.970 --> 05:25.720
by pushing out a wall and adding a huge
living room onto an existing porch for you.

05:25.809 --> 05:30.930
Actually, it's for my wife. See, she wants
a little more space in the living room.

05:31.010 --> 05:33.159
Did she tell you that,
or did you have to guess?

05:33.250 --> 05:36.950
- Oh, no. She tells me what she wants.
- Does she?

05:37.050 --> 05:39.040
We call her Pink.

05:39.129 --> 05:40.720
Pink and Ink, see?

05:40.809 --> 05:43.270
I've got a picture of Pink
standing right in front of the house.

05:43.369 --> 05:46.520
- Let's take a look at that house.
- Actually, it's a little hard to see the house.

05:46.609 --> 05:49.599
She's a… a lotta woman.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.760
Yeah, a whole lotta woman.
We'll see you there Friday. Ink.

05:53.849 --> 05:56.280
- It'll be good to get started on your house…
- Hey, Al!

05:56.369 --> 05:58.639
Here's something
you don't see every day.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.680
This is Pink last summer
on the old Slip 'N Slide.

06:02.770 --> 06:05.599
Boy, she went like a rocket.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.069
Now, no one was hurt in this.

06:08.169 --> 06:12.359
Those kids lying there
were just, uh, stunned.

06:15.250 --> 06:19.079
Maybe we shouldn't have spent
all our allowance on these baseball cards.

06:19.169 --> 06:24.559
- Hey, we had to get the Tiger infield.
- Yeah. But now we're broke.

06:24.649 --> 06:28.680
Where are we gonna
get money for Mom's gift?

06:28.770 --> 06:31.149
- Play along.
- Yeah.

06:31.250 --> 06:35.399
Hey, Mark.
You know, you're a real smart kid.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.790
- You saved your money.
- Thanks.

06:38.329 --> 06:41.869
Now you have enough
to pay your little-brother tax.

06:42.849 --> 06:43.829
My what?

06:43.930 --> 06:47.399
The younger brother pays the older brother
a tax when he's seven.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.480
I'm not paying you anything.

06:50.569 --> 06:53.079
fine. Have it your way.

06:53.169 --> 06:56.790
but we just might hide some
strange animals in your bed.

06:56.889 --> 07:01.040
- Unless you pay the tax.
- How much is it?

07:01.129 --> 07:05.319
- How much you got?
- $4.77.

07:05.409 --> 07:07.200
Sorry. It's $5.OO.

07:07.290 --> 07:12.440
Come on, Randy. He's our little brother.
Give him a break.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.639
OK.

07:16.730 --> 07:19.520
- We'll help you empty this thing out.
- Yeah.

07:19.609 --> 07:22.440
- Thanks, guys.
- Don't run in the house.

07:24.169 --> 07:26.470
Honey. I said
stop running in the house.

07:26.569 --> 07:28.559
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:29.730 --> 07:33.079
- Got a little list of things for your birthday.
- You haven't gotten me a gift yet?

07:33.169 --> 07:36.079
Yeah, sure I have. I just wonder
if you can guess which one it is.

07:36.169 --> 07:38.359
Why don't you surprise me?

07:38.450 --> 07:41.839
At your age,
the surprise could kill you.

07:44.409 --> 07:47.440
Well. let me give you a hint.

07:47.530 --> 07:51.200
Never give a woman
anything she has to plug in.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.599
Tim.

08:00.690 --> 08:05.159
I want you to be
completely honest with me.

08:06.050 --> 08:10.990
Do I look, like, a whole lot older
than when you met me?

08:12.010 --> 08:15.159
- A whole lot older?
- Just answer the question.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.000
Of course you don't look
a whole lot older.

08:17.089 --> 08:20.319
Well, you have to admit I'm not
that same skinny little peanut you married.

08:20.409 --> 08:22.119
Yeah. I know.

08:25.089 --> 08:28.629
You look better. That's what I meant.
No, you look a lot better. You do.

08:28.730 --> 08:32.429
- You don't think I'm too fat?
- No.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.909
You look perfect.

08:38.010 --> 08:42.119
Don't lie to me. You wish that
I looked like that for my birthday.

08:43.129 --> 08:46.280
That would be for my birthday.

08:46.369 --> 08:49.399
Come on, honey! Come on…

08:49.490 --> 08:53.480
Dad, did you get Mom
another dorky birthday gift this year?

08:53.569 --> 08:56.839
Yeah, should I make room for it
in the closet?

08:59.169 --> 09:02.790
Real funny. What'd you two brainiacs
get her that was so wonderful?

09:02.889 --> 09:07.159
Well, Brad and I got her
this really neat perfume.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.680
You sure you got enough of it?

09:12.770 --> 09:16.040
Ohh! Treasure Island perfume.

09:16.129 --> 09:21.559
This came in a gift set, didn't it?
Little parrot and a peg leg for her?

09:21.649 --> 09:23.760
Arr, matey! Arr!

09:23.849 --> 09:26.839
Look like a pirate,
and I smell like one, too.

09:26.930 --> 09:31.869
I made her a crayon drawing,
and I used every color in the box.

09:31.970 --> 09:36.399
That's good, see? It's nice to make stuff
for her. You tuned right in to her, Mark.

09:36.490 --> 09:40.159
I tuned in to her, too.
I got her a neat gift, too.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.800
What?

09:41.889 --> 09:44.639
You know how
she's been exercising, right?

09:44.730 --> 09:50.079
Well. I got her a lifetime membership
at that Galaxy Health Spa.

09:50.169 --> 09:54.399
Can't wait to see the look
on her face when she opens that.

09:54.490 --> 09:57.000
Here she comes. Sit down.

09:57.089 --> 09:58.599
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.760
Happy birthday!

10:03.329 --> 10:08.349
- What's the matter?
- I am never ever going to exercise again.

10:11.649 --> 10:15.399
I was actually thinking
of joining a health club.

10:15.490 --> 10:19.399
That'll be a cold day in Detroit.

10:20.250 --> 10:24.159
- Mom, open our gifts.
- Yeah. Dad, you want to go first?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.959
It's her birthday all day,
why give her every gift at once?

10:30.050 --> 10:33.560
- You didn't get me anything, did you?
- He did. He got you…

10:33.649 --> 10:36.760
Haµµy birthday to yo4

10:36.850 --> 10:40.120
Haµµy birthday to yo4

10:40.209 --> 10:44.160
Haµµy birthday, dear Mom

10:44.249 --> 10:47.439
Haµµy birthday to yo4

10:51.569 --> 10:55.039
Al, what am I gonna do?
I have to get Jill a birthday present.

10:55.129 --> 10:58.959
It's got to come from the heart.
I can't plug it in and I can't rewire it.

10:59.050 --> 11:01.879
- What the heck does that leave?
- Tim, concentrate.

11:01.970 --> 11:06.680
We're going on the air live in a minute.
Now, where's the owner. Mr Ingram?

11:06.769 --> 11:11.319
I don't know. He's supposed to meet us
here. We'll go without him if he's not here.

11:11.410 --> 11:14.600
- Here we go. In five…
- Think about a gift for me.

11:14.689 --> 11:16.600
Gift, gift. gift, gift.

11:17.609 --> 11:21.200
Hi, everybody. I'm Tim Taylor. Welcome
to this special edition of Tool Time.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.560
here at our project house
in beautiful Keego Harbor Heights.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.280
- Howdy, Al.
- Howdy, Tim.

11:26.370 --> 11:27.720
Al, what are we doing today?

11:27.810 --> 11:32.359
Well, Tim, we'll be expanding the Ingrams'
living room out here onto the porch.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.240
But first we get
to dismantle the existing porch.

11:35.330 --> 11:38.120
We'll be carting the debris away in this -

11:38.209 --> 11:42.999
the beautiful Tool Time truck.
Blood. Sweat, and Gears.

11:44.330 --> 11:50.080
This is not your standard Detroit issue.
We've made a few engine modifications.

11:50.169 --> 11:53.760
Of course, when you say "we"
you mean "you".

11:55.410 --> 12:01.399
That's right, Al, because if I left it up to you,
we'd be on a skateboard and a moped.

12:04.930 --> 12:10.050
Hear that? That's a Big-Block Chevy. 454,
two four-barrel carburettors

12:10.129 --> 12:15.149
nestled on aluminum high-rise
manifold headers, and dual exhaust.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.359
- Let's back her into position, Al.
- All right.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.789
We'll be back live
right after these messages.

12:31.569 --> 12:33.120
Tim. I'm going back to the truck.

12:33.209 --> 12:35.839
Oh, come on, Al.
I need a second opinion. Come on.

12:35.930 --> 12:37.149
Well, it's…

12:37.249 --> 12:41.479
It's just I feel a little awkward. I've never
been in the women's department before.

12:41.569 --> 12:43.120
Hi, Al.

12:43.209 --> 12:47.919
- Why did that woman say hi to you?
- Maybe I remind her of someone.

12:49.249 --> 12:54.560
Remind her of someone named Al, who
looks like you, with a hammer in his belt?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.839
Hi, Al.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.680
OK. I'm not gonna to lie to you.

13:03.769 --> 13:06.680
Sometimes I come here
to try and meet women.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.039
What?!

13:08.129 --> 13:11.120
- Hi, Al.
- Hi. Mrs Chapman.

13:11.209 --> 13:13.560
I just wanted to mention
there's a sale tomorrow

13:13.649 --> 13:16.640
in the full-figured ladies' department.

13:16.729 --> 13:21.919
- Maybe you're not interested in that type.
- No, my mother was quite large.

13:22.490 --> 13:24.240
Good luck.

13:40.129 --> 13:42.640
You scare me, Al.

13:42.729 --> 13:47.439
Well, what do you expect me to do?
Dating's tough. I go where the women are.

13:47.530 --> 13:51.200
Art galleries.
Laundromats, immigration.

13:52.050 --> 13:54.399
Don't tell me this stuff. OK?

13:54.490 --> 13:56.479
Let's get…

13:57.530 --> 13:59.959
Immigration?

14:03.410 --> 14:06.479
Let's… let's try to tune in to my wife Jill.

14:06.569 --> 14:09.080
Look around. Do you think
she'd like anything in here?

14:09.169 --> 14:13.800
Well, if I were Jill.
I'd like any of these things.

14:15.129 --> 14:17.120
Al, please'

14:18.490 --> 14:24.120
Now, what about these dresses? I'm a little
confused. Six, eight, ten, twelve…

14:24.209 --> 14:26.560
Does that mean twelve inches?

14:26.649 --> 14:29.560
Well, that doesn't sound right.

14:35.050 --> 14:39.399
Let's figure this…
I've got a 32 waist, right? I wear a 32 pant.

14:39.490 --> 14:42.240
Jill's smaller than me.
She's got to be… 20.

14:42.330 --> 14:46.160
Well, here.
That would be this.

14:48.569 --> 14:51.399
You look like a hang-glider, Al.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.839
Well, a more personal gift
would be lingerie.

14:54.930 --> 14:58.879
- Hey! Bingo! Jill loves lingerie.
- Yeah?

14:59.370 --> 15:02.640
How do you know if it's her?
Or anybody?

15:02.729 --> 15:05.680
Could you picture her in this?

15:05.769 --> 15:07.760
Not now.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.870
Excuse me,
are you looking for a gift?

15:15.330 --> 15:20.120
- I need some help. What do wives like?
- I'm not sure. I'm not married myself.

15:25.850 --> 15:29.160
Oh. I'm so sorry. Is the smell
of my perfume bothering you?

15:29.249 --> 15:32.280
No. It's a lovely fragrance.

15:32.370 --> 15:35.560
- What's it called?
- Available.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.919
Really?

15:40.010 --> 15:43.519
We have a full line of men's cologne.
Would you be interested?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.560
Yes, I am.

15:46.569 --> 15:48.720
Al, you're gonna help me.

15:48.919 --> 15:52.070
- You know. I haven't seen you here before.
- Al?

15:52.159 --> 15:54.990
This is a temp job.
Actually. I'm an actress.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.860
Really? I'm on television.
I have my own show.

16:05.960 --> 16:11.149
OK, boys. I'm going out for some aspirin
and some Epsom salts.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.990
When your daddy comes home,
tell him that I'll be right back.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.269
Mom, since you're going out.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.990
why don't you wear
some of our Treasure Island perfume?

16:19.080 --> 16:20.429
Yeah.

16:20.519 --> 16:23.750
Well. I was saving that
for a special occasion.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.620
Well, there's plenty of it here.
You can wear it all the time.

16:32.399 --> 16:33.620
Yeah.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.669
l could do that, couldn't I?

16:36.759 --> 16:39.629
Well… go ahead.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.179
OK. I will.

16:46.759 --> 16:48.190
Whoa!

16:48.279 --> 16:51.149
That is so unique.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.230
Ohh! It tingles.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.230
And burns.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.230
Well, you know, that is always a sign
of a really good perfume.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.069
Well. I'm glad you like it.
We almost didn't buy it.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.670
Yeah. We were gonna buy you flowers.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.990
Oh. Well…

17:09.079 --> 17:11.868
I guess I really lucked out,
cos flowers die.

17:11.960 --> 17:15.868
and this I'm gonna have forever.

17:17.519 --> 17:19.549
Wilson, Wilson!

17:19.640 --> 17:22.910
- Hi-de-ho, neighbor.
- Oh, Wilson, great.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.269
You gotta help me.
I'm in big, big trouble.

17:26.358 --> 17:28.819
It's Jill's birthday, right?

17:28.920 --> 17:33.549
Yeah, and she wants me to get something
that's in tune with her and from the heart.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.630
and I don't know what to do, Wilson.

17:35.720 --> 17:40.150
- Tim. I am reminded of a story.
- Wilson. I don't have time for this.

17:40.240 --> 17:44.269
Well, neighbor,
what is time but "Tim" with an e?

17:44.359 --> 17:45.950
Huh?

17:51.359 --> 17:56.750
Anyway, there once was this little boy in
Africa who wanted to give his teacher a gift.

17:56.839 --> 17:58.950
but he had no money.

17:59.039 --> 18:04.710
So he walked two days to the ocean,
and he picked up a handful of sand.

18:04.799 --> 18:08.339
and walked two days back,
and he gave it to her.

18:09.359 --> 18:12.390
She was greatly moved by the gift.

18:12.480 --> 18:16.670
but she said.
"It was so far for you to walk:'

18:16.759 --> 18:22.230
And he said. "Teacher,
the journey is part of the gift."

18:23.440 --> 18:26.269
Yeah, but Wilson.
I've been on the journey.

18:26.359 --> 18:29.710
It's the destination. It's the sand.
I don't know what to get her.

18:29.799 --> 18:32.150
Well, Tim,
maybe you're just trying too hard.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.230
And she's not being any help.
She's being so sensitive about this.

18:35.319 --> 18:39.019
Well, sometimes birthdays
only remind us of how old we are.

18:40.480 --> 18:46.390
Maybe Jill needs to be reminded of all
the simple joys she had in getting there.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.789
- What kind of gift would do that?
- Well. I don't know, Tim.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.150
You'll have to listen to that little voice
inside you. It'll tell you what to do.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.700
What's it sound like?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.750
It sounds… like this.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.430
What are you doing?

19:20.519 --> 19:23.430
Dad wants to talk to you.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.269
Mark and I were talking out in the garage.

19:25.359 --> 19:29.509
Do you guys know anything
about a little-brother tax?

19:32.039 --> 19:33.869
No.No.

19:33.960 --> 19:39.190
Maybe I should tell you about
the large-angry-father tax.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.509
All right, all right.
We'll pay Mark back.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.910
You're darn right you'll pay him back. Next
mo weeks, your allowance goes to Mark.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.950
Come on. Let's go.

19:49.039 --> 19:54.829
I want you to go upstairs and tell
your mom to come down here right away.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.390
Mom! Dad wants you!

19:59.480 --> 20:01.940
I could have done that!

20:12.960 --> 20:16.910
- What are you up to?
- I finished your birthday gift.

20:18.599 --> 20:21.589
- You gave me… tools.
- No.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.309
Open it up.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.750
All right.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.920
- This is the gift.
- What…?

20:33.000 --> 20:38.190
Too often in our lives we look at birthdays
as just a signpost of the years we lived.

20:38.279 --> 20:42.670
instead of relishing the wonder
of the journey to get the sand.

20:42.759 --> 20:44.750
What?

20:47.400 --> 20:48.430
Watch.

21:06.519 --> 21:11.029
- Oh, my gosh. Where did you get that?
- Watch, watch.

21:11.119 --> 21:15.190
Oh, that's the first time
I ever saw the ocean.

21:16.279 --> 21:19.789
And there I am in my princess dress.

21:20.799 --> 21:24.950
And that's my cat. Samantha.
I called her Sammy.

21:25.039 --> 21:26.259
And… Oh.

21:26.359 --> 21:28.349
Who is that?

21:30.680 --> 21:35.069
That's a man you'll meet years later
and marry, and he loves you very much.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.150
That is so…

21:38.920 --> 21:43.230
- What is that?
- I had to record over this gladiator movie.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.230
There's that pause button I slipped off.
Stick him. Demetrius! Get him!

21:50.640 --> 21:55.349
Honey, this is the best gift I ever got.
I can't believe you did this.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.430
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.990
It burns.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.869
Hello? Hi. Ink.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.029
You heard about it, huh?

22:31.119 --> 22:35.869
That truck took off like a rocket,
just like Pink on the Slip 'N Slide.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.269
We didn't stun any kids, though.
Al and I will be by Monday. Uh-huh. Early.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.950
We'll finish up that living room then.
OK, thanks.

23:12.799 --> 23:17.990
Hear that? That's a Big-Block Chevy. 454,
mo four-barrel carburettors

23:18.079 --> 23:23.019
nestled on aluminum high-rise
manifold headers, and dual exhaust.

23:24.119 --> 23:27.630
- Let's back her into position, Al.
- All right.
