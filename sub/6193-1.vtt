00:28.320 --> 00:32.598
THEY LIVE

02:54.360 --> 02:57.989
JOB OPPORTUNITIES

03:10.320 --> 03:14.552
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.992
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.119
They lost 14 banks in one week.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.556
There's nothing available for you,
right now.

03:42.120 --> 03:47.911
They use their tongues to
deceive you. Venom is on their lips.

03:48.120 --> 03:54.116
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.472
The fear of God
is not before their eyes.

03:58.680 --> 04:06.439
They have taken
the hearts and minds of our leaders.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.632
They have blinded us to the truth.

04:09.840 --> 04:15.676
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?

04:15.880 --> 04:21.591
Outside the limit of our sight
they're feeding off us.

04:21.800 --> 04:28.353
Perched on top of us
from birth to death, are our owners.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.236
They have us. They control us.
They are our masters.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.194
Wake up.
They're all around you.

05:01.640 --> 05:08.113
<i>Sometimes when I watch TV</i>
<i>I stop being myself. I'm a star. </i>

05:08.320 --> 05:13.952
<i>I have my own talk show. Or I'm</i>
<i>on the news getting out of a limo. </i>

05:14.160 --> 05:19.109
<i>All I ever have to do is be famous. </i>
<i>People watch me. </i>

05:19.320 --> 05:22.676
<i>And they love me. </i>

05:22.880 --> 05:28.273
<i>I never grow old, and I never die. </i>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.432
Excuse me,
do you need anybody?

05:51.080 --> 05:54.755
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.519
This is a union job.

06:04.320 --> 06:11.749
May I please speak
with the shop steward, sir?

06:46.560 --> 06:51.554
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.753
Excuse me, when do I get paid?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.394
Thursday.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.038
Do you need a place to stay?

07:13.240 --> 07:19.679
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.953
I don't like being followed
unless I know why.

07:51.160 --> 07:56.712
I don't turn up with anybody
until I see where he's going.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.755
They'll be serving food up soon.

08:32.960 --> 08:39.149
This is Gilbert. Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.432
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.

08:43.640 --> 08:49.192
If you can use them,
you can fix the shower over there.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.597
Let's get something to eat.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.349
- More?
- Yeah.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.312
I've got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.593
I haven't seen them in six months.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.636
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.

09:38.440 --> 09:45.278
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.959
The golden rule: He who has the gold
makes the rules.

09:55.480 --> 10:00.918
If they close one more factory, we
should take a sledge to their foreign cars.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.989
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.513
The whole deal
is some kind of crazy game.

10:11.720 --> 10:16.271
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.

10:16.480 --> 10:22.828
Only everyone is out for themselves
and looking to do you in.

10:23.040 --> 10:29.479
You do what you can, but I'm going
to do my best to blow your ass away.

10:34.840 --> 10:41.279
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.678
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.430
Everybody has got
their own hard times, these days.

11:12.800 --> 11:18.750
<i>You thought press-on nails would</i>
<i>impede all the active things you do. </i>

11:18.960 --> 11:24.193
<i>We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, </i>
<i>easy-to-apply nails. </i>

11:24.400 --> 11:28.313
<i>There's seven different colors... </i>

11:29.840 --> 11:32.559
<i>Our impulses are being redirected. </i>

11:32.760 --> 11:38.039
<i>We live in an artificially-induced</i>
<i>state of consciousness. </i>

11:38.240 --> 11:43.109
Goddamn hacker. That's the second
time tonight that asshole has cut in.

11:43.320 --> 11:47.871
<i>The movement began eight months ago</i>
<i>by a group of scientists. </i>

11:48.080 --> 11:53.029
<i>They accidentally discovered</i>
<i>these signals being sent... </i>

11:56.040 --> 11:59.112
That thing's giving me a headache.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.949
It must have taken him months
to figure out how to do this.

12:03.160 --> 12:09.429
<i>The under-class is growing. </i>
<i>Human rights are non-existent. </i>

12:09.640 --> 12:17.194
<i>In their repressive society, we</i>
<i>are their unwitting accomplices. </i>

12:18.680 --> 12:23.800
<i>Their intention to rule rests with</i>
<i>the annihilation of consciousness. </i>

12:24.000 --> 12:30.678
<i>We have been lulled into a trance. </i>
<i>They have made us indifferent. </i>

12:30.880 --> 12:36.193
<i>We are focused</i>
<i>only on our own gain... </i>

12:43.560 --> 12:48.315
<i>They are safe</i>
<i>as long as they are not discovered. </i>

12:48.520 --> 12:53.878
<i>That is their method of survival. </i>
<i>Keep us asleep. Keep us selfish. </i>

12:54.080 --> 12:59.473
<i>- Keep us sedated. </i>
- Blow it out of your ass.

14:21.520 --> 14:27.709
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.877
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.

14:43.520 --> 14:49.914
<i>The sleeping middle-class</i>
<i>is suddenly becoming poor. </i>

14:50.120 --> 14:56.036
<i>We are their cattle. </i>
<i>We are being bred for slavery. </i>

14:56.920 --> 15:02.278
- Not again.
<i>- We cannot break their signal. </i>

15:02.480 --> 15:07.793
<i>The signal must be shut off</i>
<i>at the source. </i>

15:08.000 --> 15:10.912
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.

15:14.520 --> 15:20.038
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.236
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP

17:07.119 --> 17:09.839
There's nothing wrong with it.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.675
Only a few seconds got on the air.

17:15.880 --> 17:20.510
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.

17:20.720 --> 17:27.068
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work. We've discussed this.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.158
We have no other choice.

17:37.680 --> 17:44.119
Robbing banks. Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.433
We've got to find strong people
who'll work with us.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.993
I'm just leaving. Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.513
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.837
Now your hands.

18:38.040 --> 18:42.511
You're a working man.
The revolution...

18:42.720 --> 18:48.078
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.

18:49.040 --> 18:54.114
This world may have blinded me,
but the Lord let me see.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.471
You'll be back.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.832
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.396
An epidemic of violence
is what they're saying.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.149
I was talking
to one old boy from San Anselmo.

19:26.360 --> 19:32.435
He says up there they're talking
end-of-the-world kind of stuff.

19:47.040 --> 19:51.238
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.

19:51.440 --> 19:58.198
A whole lot of people going crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.869
The truth is, this kind of shit
happens at the end of every century.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.153
It's just people
afraid to face the future.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.354
What's happening?

20:21.560 --> 20:27.669
I was inside there. It's full of boxes
and some kind of lab setup.

20:27.880 --> 20:31.998
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.

20:34.440 --> 20:39.070
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.795
Gilbert is in there helping them.

20:47.640 --> 20:52.794
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.393
I don't bother nobody. Nobody bothers
me. You should do the same.

21:05.080 --> 21:11.155
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.956
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

22:04.080 --> 22:08.517
Step down. Easy. This way.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.918
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.152
Go, go!

24:36.160 --> 24:38.151
Frank!

25:22.560 --> 25:27.998
Leave us alone.
We know you.

25:40.720 --> 25:46.795
"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil."

27:12.400 --> 27:17.076
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.836
Did somebody start WW III?

28:02.080 --> 28:08.076
<i>Oman's collection</i>

28:08.280 --> 28:12.478

Thank you, sir.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.433
Here you are, sir. Thank you.

Are you going to pay for that?

34:06.320 --> 34:07.673

34:08.280 --> 34:13.717

She didn't even go to Lamas class.

34:57.720 --> 35:02.669
I told her,
for yourself and the baby, go.

35:36.000 --> 35:43.315
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas! So dated!

35:52.080 --> 35:56.232
- I'm so depressed. What do I do?
- Go for it, man.

35:56.440 --> 36:00.831
That's easy for you to say,
you got the promotion.

36:01.640 --> 36:08.318
<i>The feeling is definitely there. </i>
<i>It's a new morning in America. </i>

<i>The old cynicism is gone. </i>
<i>We have faith in our leaders. </i>

<i>We're optimistic</i>
<i>as to what becomes of it all. </i>

36:16.600 --> 36:22.630
<i>It really boils down</i>
<i>to our ability to accept. </i>

36:22.840 --> 36:28.312
<i>- There are no limits. </i>
- I figured on something like this.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.632
Excuse me.

36:33.560 --> 36:38.554
You look like your head
fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.954
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.

36:48.160 --> 36:52.711
I take these glasses off,
she looks like a regular person.

36:52.920 --> 36:58.438
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.872
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.990
I've got one that can see.

37:16.200 --> 37:21.433
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.599
I don't like this one bit.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.234
Not one bit.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.155
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.

37:57.200 --> 38:02.718
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?

38:02.920 --> 38:06.674
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.639
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?

38:12.840 --> 38:16.913
You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

38:17.120 --> 38:22.274
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.

38:23.920 --> 38:30.917
You stumbled onto something here,
but maybe we can all benefit from it.

38:32.680 --> 38:36.958
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk this over.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.510
You bastards die just like we do.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.631
I have come here to chew bubblegum
and kick ass.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.956
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

40:11.640 --> 40:18.193
Near the entrance. Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s. Long hair.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.269
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.671
And who are you?

40:53.400 --> 40:58.269
Come to show them where I am.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.438
Drop it.

41:09.680 --> 41:13.116
Drop it.

41:19.120 --> 41:21.839
Beat it.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.028
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.478
Close the door.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.750
Drive.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.273
Not too fast.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.278
They're gone.

42:55.120 --> 42:58.715
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?

42:58.920 --> 43:02.151
- Are you married?
- Yes.

43:04.440 --> 43:09.070
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.479
Live alone?

43:15.000 --> 43:18.709
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.

43:18.920 --> 43:23.152
I'm afraid I must insist.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.836
Hi, Holly!

44:28.520 --> 44:34.390
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.676
It's like a drug. Wearing
these glasses makes you high...

44:40.880 --> 44:43.314
...but you come down hard.

44:43.520 --> 44:49.390
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.

44:50.480 --> 44:55.838
I'm sorry,
but I needed you to get away.

44:56.040 --> 45:03.799
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.

45:05.640 --> 45:13.115
We're in trouble. They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.

45:13.320 --> 45:18.394
We're being controlled by these things
and we've got to stop them.

45:18.600 --> 45:25.836
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

45:26.040 --> 45:29.828
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

45:32.360 --> 45:38.117
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.

45:40.880 --> 45:46.398
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.

45:46.600 --> 45:51.674
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.

45:56.320 --> 46:03.908
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way... It's your way.

46:42.640 --> 46:48.556
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.315
Go ahead.

47:15.080 --> 47:20.757
I'm sorry I have to be here.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.797
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.

47:41.280 --> 47:45.831
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?

47:48.480 --> 47:52.473
Assistant program director. Cable 54.

47:52.680 --> 47:58.949
A TV station? They're sending
signals out of TV sets.

48:12.680 --> 48:17.071
No, I'm all right.

48:25.400 --> 48:30.633
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.876
Yes, I'll hold.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.399
Frank?

50:51.600 --> 50:56.799
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.629
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?

51:00.840 --> 51:04.276
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.119
You ain't showing me nothing.

51:07.320 --> 51:11.359
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.076
Get out of here.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.315
No!

53:08.520 --> 53:15.039
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.989
Wait!

53:22.200 --> 53:25.431
You'd better find someplace to hide.

53:25.640 --> 53:28.791
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!

53:29.000 --> 53:33.312
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.

53:38.760 --> 53:42.992
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

53:43.200 --> 53:47.432
You can't even save yourself.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.997
I'm giving you a choice. Put these on
or start eating that trash can.

53:56.800 --> 54:00.588
- Not this year.
- Okay.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.469
Come on.

54:25.520 --> 54:30.116
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.754
Put on the glasses.

54:54.720 --> 54:58.190
I told you
I didn't want to be involved.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.839
Dirty motherfucker.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.879
Take a look. Put them on.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.237
No!

57:08.200 --> 57:10.919
I'm sorry.

57:27.160 --> 57:30.596
Put the glasses on. Put them on!

57:52.440 --> 57:55.193
Fuck you!

58:49.400 --> 58:51.595
Look! They're everywhere.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.951
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.

58:56.680 --> 59:01.800
Hold on. You aren't the first one
to wake up out of a dream.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.355
What's that?

59:12.280 --> 59:18.549
Brother, life's a bitch...
and she's back in heat.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.074
I want a room.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.710
Ain't love grand?

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.838
CONFORM

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.510
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.074
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.751
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.317
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.956
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.757
When you get your master plan,
you let me know.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.957
If we can see, we've got to find
the people who made these.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.590
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.036
A long time ago,
things were different.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:30.310
Daddy took me down to the river and
told me about the power and the glory.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.159
I was saved.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:40.675
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.598
I ran away when I was 13.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.750
He tried to cut me once
with a big old razor.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.832
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:08.310
He kept moving back and forth,
like he was sawing down a tree.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:18.079
Maybe they've always been with us,
those things out there.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.593
Maybe they love it,
seeing us hate each other.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.999
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.318
I've got news for him.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.229
There's going to be hell to pay.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.434
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.868
Frank?

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:28.354
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.750
The world needs a wake-up call.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.190
We're going to phone it in.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.795
Hey brothers...

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.830
There's something new going down.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:35.279
They're using candyfloss packaging
to cover up a toxic waste dump.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:52.551
Frank, glad you made it. Take your
glasses off. We're all human in here.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.159
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.915
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.279
Go ahead.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.471
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.753
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.036
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.994
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:00.753
Promotions, bank accounts,
new houses, cars.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.159
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:15.157
<i>Fluorocarbons have increased since</i>
<i>1958. Earth is being acclimatised. </i>

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.558
<i>They are turning our atmosphere</i>
<i>into their atmosphere. </i>

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.515
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.670
The earth is just another developing
planet. Their third world.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.759
<i>... deplete the planet, </i>
<i>move on to another. </i>

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:41.911
<i>They want benign indifference. </i>
<i>We could be pets or food. </i>

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.317
<i>But all we really are is livestock. </i>

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:53.228
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.639
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.559
Once.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.753
- What's that?
- One of their watches.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.954
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.633
They've got secret code.
They push a button...

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:26.676
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.910
Listen up. We're obviously
not getting to enough people.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.911
There should be twice as many people
here. We're getting too sloppy.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:45.036
Their detection
is becoming more effective.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:51.314
Stay aware. Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.990
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:02.390
Stop talking about it. It's time
we started spilling some blood.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.153
Wait a minute! We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:13.148
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:18.036
We locate their signal
and shut it off.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:25.078
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.033
KRDA is clear.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.791
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.910
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal is coming from.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.874
I've got to talk to someone.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:07.156
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.070
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:20.393
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.357
I just want to...

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.878
Can we...?

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.470
Get out!

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.470
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.239
There's nothing you can do out there.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.958
If I can get this working,
I can listen in.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.149
- Frank...
- What?

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.477
- Get set.
- Shit!

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.119
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.750
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear...

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.635
Move! Down there!

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.598
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.600
Two seconds.
One second.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.197
If you need assistance
in finding your destination. - 

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.269
- Bilingual instructions
are posted in each corridor.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.909
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.033
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.074
Some kind of underground base.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.877
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:14.235
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.953
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.199
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.600
I'm hearing something.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.233
By the year 2025,
America and the entire planet -

01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.070
- Will be under the protection
of this power alliance.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:08.197
The gains have been substantial for us
and for you, the human power-elite.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:24.153
You have given us the resources
we need for our expansion.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.353
In return, the per-capita income
of each of you has grown.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.429
This year alone,
it's an average 39%.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.395
I've received word that our forces
have won a major victory.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.391
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.513
The situation is normal again.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.269
Hi boys, I didn't know
you'd been recruited.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.110
You should have dressed
for the party now you can afford it.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.639
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.755
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:28.072
I knew we had a lot in common
the first time we met.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.917
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.798
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.791
I know it's only for emergency,
but they're so much fun.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.912
You think that's something,
take a look at this.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.271
- Take a closer look.
<i>- Attention, commuters. </i>

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.554
<i>Flight Alpha</i> 7 <i>to Andromeda</i>
<i>is now ready. </i>

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.150
That's where they come from.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:38.278
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:44.316
It puts a bend in the light and
you move from place to place.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.991
The whole thing
works like one big airport.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:57.273
They've got their act together,
believe you me.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.716
Evening, boys. Looking sharp.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.435
Wait till you see
what I'm going to show you now.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.832
Here's the brains of the operation.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.352
The signal goes out through
the satellite all over the world.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:36.236
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.749
This is as far as we go.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:07.354
Can you get us inside? I've never
seen the inside of a TV studio.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.430
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.599
Those boys over there
are friends of mine.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.796
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.357
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.915
Right here.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.072
Watch the door.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.914
- Soundproof. Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:52.269
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.631
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.868
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:07.235
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.319
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.991
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.990
If we help them, they'll leave us
alone to make some money.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.479
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.832
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.955
We all sell out every day,
might as well be on the winning team.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.635
See you, boys.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.436
Let's go.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.074
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.795
What the hell is going on?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.670
Down!

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.638
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.077
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.193
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program... something.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.713
Security alert. Sections Delta
and X-ray report to the fourth floor.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.275
Who's Holly?

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.230
Shit!

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.677
I hate to interrupt. Could you
tell me how to get to the roof?

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:14.557
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.749
There's got to be more than one way
to get up there.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.032
Security 950. They're on the move.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.952
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st. We've got them.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.913
Holly!

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.030
Come on!

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:12.190
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.755
Frank! Are you and Holly clear?

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.431
I'm clear, are you?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.560
Don't do it.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.713
Don't interfere. You can't win.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.429
Drop your weapon.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.431
Stand away from the dish
or we'll open fire.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:29.909
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds. Nine...

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.953
Eight. Seven.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.669
Six.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.034
<i>The Oscar winners</i>
<i>give a press conference... </i>

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.712
<i>- Gloria, you look like shit. </i>
<i>- What happened? </i>

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:31.631
<i>All the sex and violence on the</i>
<i>screen has gone too far for me. </i>

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:38.473
<i>I'm fed up with it. Film makers</i>
<i>have to show some restraint... </i>

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.676
<i>What's wrong, baby? </i>
