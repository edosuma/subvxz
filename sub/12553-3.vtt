she'd seen someone suspicious.

a hand changing a tire?

It's like your dad said,
your mum's just seeing things.

Androvax is a genocidal killer
who destroyed 12 worlds.

Let alone the nasty habit
he has of jumping into
other peoples' bodies.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.870
So if he is here,
that can only be trouble.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.206
Which is why
we should ask Mr Smith
for help now.

I met a Bookan pirate

13:31.443 --> 13:34.980
who'd acquired
the activator disc
to a vault here on Earth.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.982
That's where the ship
now rests.

13:37.049 --> 13:40.319
Hold on, who puts a crashed
space ship into a vault?

13:40.386 --> 13:41.987
Just how big is that gonna be?

13:42.054 --> 13:44.223
The vault needs two discs.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.859
I need Mr Smith to help me
crack the vault's second code.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.427
You've got to help me.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.698
I have destroyed
12 planets, 12 civilisations,

13:52.765 --> 13:54.800
please help me save just one.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.173
You can't trust him,
Sarah Jane. You of all people
know that.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.543
Of course I do.
Androvax taking control
of my body

14:04.610 --> 14:08.547
was one of the worst
experiences of my life,
but I was inside his mind

14:08.614 --> 14:10.749
just as much as he
was in mine.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.551
I felt his pain. His grief.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.653
He raged against the universe
for taking his people.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.222
And almost destroyed Earth.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.157
I know.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.260
But if that is a vault,
and there is a chance
of saving a species,

14:21.327 --> 14:24.430
whatever Androvax has done,
I can't ignore them!

14:26.232 --> 14:27.199
Hello, Sarah.

much time for flying saucers.

a cup of tea on board, and
actually we are in a hurry.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.725
We understand that there's
been an alien sighting.

14:52.791 --> 14:56.262
Mum?
It was someone messing about.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.030
I know what I saw, Rani.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.300
There was an alien,
and it ran right up
your drive, Sarah.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.102
Well, I'm very proud
of my begonias.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.937
I didn't realise
they were a cosmic must-see.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.773
We're very used to
scepticism, Miss Smith.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.875
They just want to do
some tests.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.344

through the outer layer

-(DEVICE WHIRRING)
-It's an asylum.

Judging from the signs
outside, someone
still owns this place.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.183
RANI: Along with
a vault big enough to hide
a spaceship?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.552
SARAH JANE: Well, the vault
must be hyper-dimensional.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.554
Which means, exactly?

16:28.620 --> 16:30.556
Well, the entrance
might be here on Earth,

16:30.622 --> 16:32.958
but the vault itself
is somewhere else.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.860

a whole race

some terrible things,

his entire species
is better off extinct.

could save his species,

in a hyper-dimensional vault.

anything about that, Mr Dread?

(MACHINE BUZZING)

25:17.415 --> 25:19.885
It's picking up aliens!
It's working.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.823
(SCREAMING)

25:26.491 --> 25:27.926

(GROANS)

25:40.005 --> 25:42.374
Wait till B.U.R.P.S.S.
hear about this.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.143
-They'll kill my mum.
-But we will save
your planet.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.745
You want to get
a new motor, mate.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.981
Thank you, I'll take this one.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.017
You mean, if something's
going to happen,
it's going to happen?

Yeah.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.891
You don't need my mum,
you can take me.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.195
Will you still help me

26:04.262 --> 26:08.066
when the rebirth
of my civilisation means
the end of yours?
