00:33.408 --> 00:34.159
- I HAD A TERRIBLE DREAM
LAST NIGHT

00:34.242 --> 00:36.494
WHERE VERA WAS A DOUBLE AGENT,

00:36.578 --> 00:38.079
RUFUS WAS A KIDNAPPER,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
AND FABIAN'S GODFATHER
WAS A MOLE.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.627
- A DIFFERENT KIND OF MOLE,
AMS.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.379
- I WISH I COULD SAY IT WAS
ALL A DREAM.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.341
- OH, GRIM FACES.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.260
WELL, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.554
- WELL,
FIRST YOU CAN GROVEL.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.681
THEN YOU CAN HELP US GET TRUDY
AND OUR DOLLHOUSE BACK.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.017
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD THEM,
JEROME.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.560
- HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO

01:00.643 --> 01:01.978
IF YOU'D BEEN HONEST WITH ME.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.897
- I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT YOU
IN DANGER.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.066
TRUDY GOT TOO INVOLVED,
AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.693
I WAS TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

01:08.777 --> 01:09.944
- SAFE, SHMAFE.

01:10.028 --> 01:10.653
WE'RE GONNA BUST HER OUT,
AREN'T WE?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.489
- LOOK, JASPER,

01:12.572 --> 01:13.448
WE KNOW RUFUS.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.201
WE GO WAY BACK.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.869
HE'S PURE EVIL.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.245
- WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
YOUR HELP.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.291
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US,
AREN'T YOU, JASPER?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.338
- EVERYONE HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.381
AND THE COLLECTOR'S
IS ANTIQUITIES.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.510
THE ONE THING HE WANTS
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

01:33.593 --> 01:34.427
IS THE MASK OF ANUBIS.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.596
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU CAN TELL HIM

01:36.679 --> 01:38.014
TO GET IN LINE.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.183
- NO; BUT IF JASPER TELLS HIM
HE HAS THE MASK OF ANUBIS,

01:40.266 --> 01:42.435
THEN HE'LL WANT TO GO
AND MEET HIM.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.686
AND THEN WHILE HE'S GONE,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.313
WE CAN RESCUE TRUDY.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.524
- GREAT PLAN.
TINY FLAW.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.691
- WHAT?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.444
- WE DON'T HAVE THE MASK.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.199
- BUT RUFUS DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.701
- WE CAN USE THE REPLICA.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.079
NINA, YOU--

02:01.162 --> 02:03.122
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.169
- GIVE US A HAND WITH THESE
BOOKS, WILL YOU, GUYS?

02:12.715 --> 02:14.175
- OKAY, ALFIE.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.718
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE THE REPLICA
A SPRAY JOB.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.803
MAKE IT LOOK CONVINCING.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.388
- ART ROOM, HERE I COME.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.058
- WHAT IF RUFUS KNOWS
IT'S ONLY A REPLICA?

02:22.141 --> 02:22.976
- WELL, IF ALFIE DOES
A HALF-DECENT JOB,

02:23.059 --> 02:24.352
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.230
NO ONE'S SEEN THE ORIGINAL,
NOT EVEN HIM.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.565
- SO LET'S JUST MAKE THIS CLEAR.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.858
JEROME, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
FABIAN, ME,

02:29.941 --> 02:32.402
AMBER, AND ALFIE TO THE BARN

02:32.485 --> 02:34.737
ONCE ALFIE GIVES JASPER
THE MASK.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.865
THEN WE WAIT WHILE JASPER

02:36.948 --> 02:38.616
LURES RUFUS
TO THE MASK.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.993
- OKAY.

02:40.076 --> 02:40.994
- PATRICIA, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T MIND

02:41.077 --> 02:42.287

02:42.370 --> 02:43.454
- YEAH.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.998
I'LL JUST ATTRACT ATTENTION

03:00.471 --> 03:01.848

03:20.867 --> 03:22.493
- WELL, I'M GUESSING SINCE HE'S
WRITING UNDER A BLOG

03:22.577 --> 03:27.749

IT'S PROBABLY AN ALIAS.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.125

03:29.208 --> 03:31.002

ARTICLES ANONYMOUSLY.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.588

I DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHO HE IS.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.349

LOOK AT ME.

04:07.038 --> 04:07.830
IT'S NO BIGGIE.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.921
SEE, I KNOW I SHOULD GIVE UP,

SOMETHING JUST DRAWS ME BACK IN.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.346
RIGHT LOSER,
AREN'T I?

04:23.429 --> 04:27.016
- NO.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.476
- SO WHAT DO I DO?

04:32.105 --> 04:36.526
- MY MUM USED TO SAY
THAT PROBLEMS ARE LIKE WEEDS.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.195
THEY JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE
UNTIL YOU DIG DOWN,

04:39.278 --> 04:41.364
FIND THE ROOT,
AND YANK IT OUT.

04:41.447 --> 04:46.160
SO WHAT'S THE ROOT

FIND IT,
SOLVE IT,

05:03.511 --> 05:05.596
HOW DID IT TURN OUT?
IS IT OKAY?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.724
- I LIKE TO LET MY ART
SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.392

THAT I'M DOING MAKEOVERS

05:09.475 --> 05:11.102

THERE WILL BE REPERCUSSIONS.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.387

06:31.140 --> 06:33.267
AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING

06:59.293 --> 07:01.629
OR IT'S DETENTION FOR NINA TOO.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.721

07:10.805 --> 07:13.599
ONE: WHY ARE NINA AND ALFIE
NOT HERE YET?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.601
AND "B:" WHY DO YOU
OWN BINOCULARS?

SORRY, AMBER.

YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO FEND FOR YOURSELVES.

THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.412
- TRUDY.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.455
DID RUFUS DO ANYTHING
WITH THE DOLLHOUSE?

11:04.538 --> 11:07.124
- OH, HE WAS FASCINATED BY THAT.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.584
A BIT ODD, THOUGH:

11:08.668 --> 11:10.252
GROWN MAN PLAYING WITH
A DOLL'S HOUSE.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.087
- NEVER MIND THAT.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.004
- TRUDY, HAVE YOU SEEN A GEM?

11:12.088 --> 11:14.215
- LOOK, WE'VE GOT TRUDY NOW.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.257
LET'S JUST GO.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
- LOOK, SHE'S RIGHT, JEROME.
COME ON.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.677
[car doors slamming]

11:18.761 --> 11:19.804
- SOMEONE'S COMING.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.565
- RUFUS!
- LET US OUT!

11:31.649 --> 11:33.275
- RUFUS!

11:33.359 --> 11:34.652
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

11:34.735 --> 11:35.736
WE KNOW IT'S YOU.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.695
- RUFUS!

11:36.779 --> 11:37.196
- WRONG GUESS.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.573
YOU LOSE.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.243
- LET US OUT!

11:42.326 --> 11:43.244
- RUFUS!

11:43.327 --> 11:46.247
[grunts]

11:46.330 --> 11:47.456
&gt;&gt; THE WINDOWS ARE BARRED.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.624
IT'S NO GOOD.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.959
WE'RE TRAPPED.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.962
&gt;&gt; ONCE AGAIN, AGENT MILLINGTON
STEPS UP TO THE PLATE.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.213
WHAT'D YOU DO WITHOUT ME?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.298
THIS IS MY LAST ONE.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.925
YOU CAN USE IT
TO PICK THE LOCKS.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.302
JUST KEEP ME AWAY FROM ALL
MIRRORS AND CAMERAS UPON EXIT.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.930
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THANKS, AMBER,

12:03.013 --> 12:04.348
BUT THE LOCKS ARE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.642
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.643
- TECHNICALLY TRUE.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.979
- TRUDY,
WE WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.730
- WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
DON'T WORRY.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.898
- ACTUALLY, IF IT COMES TO IT,

12:12.982 --> 12:15.734
I AM HAPPY FOR ALL OF US
TO GET OUT SEPARATELY.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.903
I DON'T EVEN MIND GOING FIRST.

12:17.987 --> 12:18.863
JUST SAYING.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.781
- MAN UP, CLARKE.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.830
- PLEASE, JUST LET US GO,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.165
AND WE'LL GET
ALL THE REFLECTORS.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.624
I PROMISE.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.460
- WE JUST NEED TO HELP
OUR FRIENDS FIRST.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.628
- NO, THE LAST CHAMBER
IS WITHIN OUR REACH.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.213
INTO THE CONSTELLATION.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.173
&gt;&gt; BUT WE CAN'T.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.841
VICTOR HAS THREE
OF OUR REFLECTORS.

12:38.924 --> 12:43.846
- THE MAN HAS INTERFERED
TOO MANY TIMES.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.806
HE SHALL DO SO NO LONGER.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.314
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.940
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.526
BUT WE NEED TO HELP ALFIE.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.822
- IT'S NO USE.
IT WON'T BUDGE.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
- YES, WE WILL.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.243
- LISTEN.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.705
LISTEN!

13:09.788 --> 13:10.706
IT'S AN ENGINE.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.291
- IT'S RUFUS.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.001
HE'S BACK.

13:14.084 --> 13:18.172
- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HIS CAR.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.840
- IT'S GETTING CLOSER.

13:19.924 --> 13:20.966
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE.

13:21.050 --> 13:21.967
- HEY!
- HELP!

13:22.051 --> 13:22.718
[yelling]

13:22.801 --> 13:24.720
HELP!
- HELP US!

13:24.803 --> 13:26.430
HELP!
- HELP!

13:26.514 --> 13:28.015
WAIT! WHOA!
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.309
- HELP!

13:30.392 --> 13:31.644
- DON'T YOU THINK...
WE SHOULD...

13:31.727 --> 13:32.895
MAYBE...

13:32.978 --> 13:34.813
OH, MY GOSH!

13:34.897 --> 13:38.234
[crashing]

13:38.317 --> 13:40.945
- YES!
[laughs]

13:41.028 --> 13:42.279
HOW COOL WAS THAT?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.448
- I KNEW YOU'D COME, ALFIE!

13:44.532 --> 13:45.491
- OH, NICE ONE, ALFIE.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.617
- OH, NO.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.910
- WHAT IS IT?
- [gasps]

13:47.993 --> 13:49.995
- NO.
- TRUDY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.038
- ALFIE HELP ME!

13:51.121 --> 13:51.413
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.333
- ALFIE!

13:54.416 --> 13:56.585
- MY DAD.
MY DAD.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.087
- WHERE AM I?

13:58.170 --> 13:58.587
- OH, NO.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.255
- [gasps]

13:59.338 --> 14:02.341
MY DOLLHOUSE!

14:02.424 --> 14:04.426
OH, NO.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.473
- WELL, HE'S STILL IN ONE PIECE.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.059
WHAT'S HE DOING?

14:12.142 --> 14:14.603
- LOOKS LIKE HE'S FOLLOWING
THE CLUE FROM THE MOSAIC...

14:14.687 --> 14:15.938
OR THE GOBLET.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.607
AND YOU REALLY THINK SENKHARA
WANTS TO ROUGH HIM UP?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.109
BECAUSE, TO BE HONEST,
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.236
- NO!

14:22.319 --> 14:24.154
I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
HURT, OKAY?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.282
WE NEED TO GET
THOSE REFLECTORS OFF HIM

14:26.365 --> 14:28.659
FOR HIS SAKE
JUST AS MUCH AS FOR OURS.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.662
BUT FIRST
LET'S GET TO THAT BARN.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.831
[doors slam]

14:33.914 --> 14:34.873
- OH, NO.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.000
- ALFIE, GET THE PILLOWS.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.251
- GO, GO, GO.

14:37.334 --> 14:37.793
CUSHION.
- OKAY.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.169
- MY SIDE FIRST.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.799
SLOWLY.

14:43.882 --> 14:47.595
- [breathing heavily]

14:47.678 --> 14:50.014
WHERE AM I?

14:50.097 --> 14:50.556
WHY AM I ON THE SOFA?

14:50.639 --> 14:53.976
- UM, UH...

14:54.059 --> 14:55.811
- WHY ARE YOU ALL STARING AT ME?

14:55.894 --> 14:57.313
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.064
- REMEMBER WHAT?

14:59.148 --> 14:59.732
- UH-OH.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.609
CONTROL ALT DELETE.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.235
TRUDY'S LOCKED UP.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.322
- WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT IS GOING ON?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.657
TRUDY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.993
- YOU WERE GOING FOR A WALK
IN THE WOODS...

15:11.076 --> 15:12.369
AND THERE WAS...

15:12.453 --> 15:13.287
THERE WAS A...

15:13.370 --> 15:15.331
BIG BRANCH.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.540
YEAH, THE BIG BRANCH
FELL ON YOU.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.292
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

15:18.375 --> 15:20.502
- MAYBE.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.796
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.922
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

15:24.006 --> 15:24.923
- YEAH.
- YES.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.008
- OH, YEAH.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.177
- WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.138
- DON'T BOTHER HER
WITH QUESTIONS NOW, VICTOR.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.682
- THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER WAS...

15:40.230 --> 15:41.857
WHO WON THE BAKE-OFF?

15:41.940 --> 15:44.735
- OH.
[laughs]

15:44.818 --> 15:45.694
- YOU DID, DEAR.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.446
IT WAS A TRIUMPH.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.074
- OH, GOOD.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.950
THANK YOU.

15:58.499 --> 16:02.378
[clicking]

16:06.632 --> 16:08.050
- VERA!
- [gasps]

16:08.133 --> 16:09.218
OH, RUFUS.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.428
YOU GAVE ME A FRIGHT.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.554
- IS THIS REALLY
THE BEST PLACE TO MEET?

16:12.638 --> 16:15.474
THOSE KIDS--
- ARE BACK AT ANUBIS HOUSE.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.642
TRUDY TOO.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.768
- WHAT IF THEY TELL SOMEONE
WHAT THEY SAW?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.853
- WELL, WHAT COULD THEY SAY?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.814
THEY NEVER SAW EITHER OF US.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.358
TRUDY CAN BARELY REMEMBER
HER OWN NAME.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.026
SO DON'T KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.278
JASPER HAD AN ARTIFACT FOR YOU.

16:28.362 --> 16:28.696
- YEAH, HE DID.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.489
- WELL?

16:30.572 --> 16:32.866
WAS IT THE MASK?

16:32.950 --> 16:34.785
- THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER
YOU ARE SOMEONE

16:34.868 --> 16:35.911
WHO CAN BE TRUSTED OR NOT.

16:35.994 --> 16:39.873
SO I WILL TELL YOU
ALL IN GOOD TIME

16:39.957 --> 16:42.710
AFTER I HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.587
WHEN--IF I HAVE THE MASK,

16:45.671 --> 16:51.468
I WANT TO SHARE THAT POWER,
THAT STATUS,

16:51.552 --> 16:54.012
WITH YOU.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.097
- [sighs]

16:55.180 --> 16:55.931
OH, RUFUS.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.642
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.772
YES.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.276
WE'LL BE RICH.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.111
- MONETARY WEALTH IS TRIVIAL

17:09.194 --> 17:12.156
COMPARED TO THE MASK'S
TRUE POWER.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.366
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT IMMORTALITY.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.786
JOIN ME IN THE CEREMONY
OF ANUBIS, VERA.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.080
YOU AND I WILL HAVE
THE POWER OF GODS.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.792
- OH, GOODNESS.
THAT'S QUITE AN OFFER.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.128
- YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

17:27.212 --> 17:28.213
AND YOU THINK VERY QUICKLY.

17:32.050 --> 17:35.471
- I JUST WANTED
TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.307
EVELYN MERIDIAN MARTIN.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.477
JUST LET HER KNOW
THAT HER GRANDDAUGHTER CALLED,

17:41.560 --> 17:45.272
AND THAT I'LL COME VISIT
REALLY SOON.

17:45.355 --> 17:48.609
THANKS.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.819
HAVEN'T BEEN TO VISIT
IN FOREVER.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.154
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.991
- NO, NINA, YOU CAN'T BE
IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.744
YOU VISIT WHEN YOU CAN,
AND SHE KNOWS THAT.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.996
THERE'S OTHER NEWS.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.878
WHEN ALFIE BROKE DOWN
THE BARN DOOR,

18:07.961 --> 18:12.841
THE DOLLHOUSE--
- [gasps]

18:12.925 --> 18:15.219
- IT'S BEYOND REPAIR.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.137
I SAVED YOU THAT PART.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.979
- ELIXIR VITA.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.565
YES.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.693
TIS WITHIN MY GRASP.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.780
JUST NEED THAT FINAL INGREDIENT.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.366
- AND THEN WE CAN ESCAPE
ALL THIS TOGETHER, VICTOR?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.701
- YES.

18:39.785 --> 18:44.039
[whispery indistinct muttering]

18:44.122 --> 18:46.917
WHO'S THERE?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.377
SHOW YOURSELVES.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.295
- VICTOR, IT'S SO COLD.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.429
- I DEMAND
THAT YOU SHOW YOURSELVES.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.144
- VICTOR...

19:06.228 --> 19:06.645
WHAT IS IT?

19:06.728 --> 19:08.605
- THIEVES!

19:08.689 --> 19:11.817
THE PRIZE IS MINE!

19:11.900 --> 19:13.151
[clattering]

19:13.235 --> 19:14.486
ABANDON YOUR SEARCH,

19:14.570 --> 19:17.531
OR YOU WILL KNOW NO MERCY.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.659
- [screams]

19:25.330 --> 19:26.331
- [sighs]

19:30.586 --> 19:34.381
OH...

19:34.464 --> 19:36.258
JUST A DREAM.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.767
- COMING TO BREAKFAST, JOY?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.019
- YEAH, I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.020
JUST CHECKING MY MAIL.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.480
I GOT A NEW ONE
IN FROM JACK JACKAL.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.565
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.942
- HUH?

19:54.026 --> 19:57.821
- UM, REALLY?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.281
WOW.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.116
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHO IT IS YET?

20:01.199 --> 20:02.284
- NO.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.285
AND I DON'T CARE EITHER.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.912
THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT

20:04.995 --> 20:07.706
IS THAT THIS WEBSITE HAS HAD
MORE HITS THAN IT EVER HAD.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.875
- WOW.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.585
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.171
- I MEAN, IT'S MOSTLY DUE
TO MY EXTREME MAKEOVER,

20:14.254 --> 20:18.175
BUT THE APPEARANCE
OF JACK HAS HELPED.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.720
PEOPLE LOVE HIM,
SO I'M KEEPING OUT OF IT.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.722
- RIGHT.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.142
UM, I'LL SEE YOU
DOWNSTAIRS THEN.

20:30.228 --> 20:34.441
- "AMERICAN STUDENT CUTS CLASS
AND ABANDONS OWN GRANDMOTHER."

20:34.524 --> 20:37.861
YANK THAT ROOT RIGHT OUT.

20:37.945 --> 20:38.946
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WHAT IS THIS?

20:39.029 --> 20:40.447
THERE SHOULD BE STUFF HERE.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.909
RIGHT WHERE THIS TABLE IS,
THERE SHOULD BE FOOD.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.243
- WHERE IS VERA?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.745
- IT'S NOT LIKE HER
TO BE EVEN TEN SECONDS LATE

20:46.828 --> 20:48.497
FOR ANYTHING.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.250
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.752
- OH, NO VERA?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.170
I'LL MAKE BREAKFAST.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.004
LEAST I CAN REMEMBER HOW
TO DO THAT.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.674
- TRUDY, YOU SHOULD BE RESTING.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.218
- OH, IT'S A GREAT WAY
TO RECOVER.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.012
YOU KNOW, FAMILIARITY
AND PANCAKES AND SO ON.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.014
TRUDY, YOU REMEMBER HOW
I LIKE MY BACON, RIGHT?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.683
HM?

21:07.766 --> 21:11.645
&gt;&gt; NINA MARTIN, I HAVE JUST HAD
A PHONE CALL FROM MR. SWEET.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.438
YOU ARE TO GO
AND SEE HIM DIRECTLY

21:13.522 --> 21:16.358
BEFORE SCHOOL,
WHICH IS NOW.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.694
- HEY, SURE IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.861
- YEAH.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.655
I MEAN, WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG?

21:21.738 --> 21:25.200
UNLESS YOU COUNT LYING
AND STEALING AND SKIPPING SCHOOL

21:25.283 --> 21:27.160
TO FOLLOW
A 3,000-YEAR-OLD QUEST.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.371
- FAIR ENOUGH.
- [sighs]

21:29.454 --> 21:31.289
- AH, WHERE IS VERA?

21:39.798 --> 21:41.800
VERA!

21:53.812 --> 21:57.107
VERA.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.276
VERA, ARE YOU UP HERE?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.084
OH, VERA, NO.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.211
WHAT'S HAPP--
