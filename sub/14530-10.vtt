00:00.734 --> 00:01.767
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:05.070
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:07.539
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:07.541 --> 00:10.376
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:10.378 --> 00:12.378
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.613
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:19.318
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:21.687
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:24.323
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:24.325 --> 00:27.126
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:30.031 --> 00:33.065
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:36.135
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:37.637 --> 00:39.638
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:42.041
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:42.043 --> 00:43.642
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:43.644 --> 00:46.311
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:59.626 --> 01:01.727
Coffee, thanks.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.795
Okay.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.800
(phone ringing)

01:11.504 --> 01:13.639
Here you go.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.386
Watch it, man!

01:37.297 --> 01:38.330
(car honks)

01:38.332 --> 01:39.631
(distorted):
Hey! Get out

01:39.633 --> 01:40.866
Of the street, man.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.208
(woman screams)

01:49.210 --> 01:50.309
Man:
Get an ambulance!

01:50.311 --> 01:52.377
Man 2:
I'll call 911.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.615
Cleveland coroner
sent this scan

01:56.617 --> 01:58.183
Of victim carl bruno.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.485
Male.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.121
36.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.423
C.O.D. Was blunt force trauma
from vehicular impact.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.725
Witnesses described him
as being disoriented

02:06.727 --> 02:08.327
And possibly hallucinating

02:08.329 --> 02:11.797
How did mr. Bruno's death get
on the fda's radar?

02:11.799 --> 02:15.734
This prescription bottle
was found at the accident scene.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.136
They're drugs purchased

02:17.138 --> 02:18.370
From an online
canadian pharmacy.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.739
Jpbpharmacy.Com.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.774
The federal drug administration
has been tracking this pharmacy

02:22.776 --> 02:24.643
For about two weeks
based on complaints

02:24.645 --> 02:26.411
Coming in
to our medwatch hotline.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.313
The callers all have
similar stories.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.448
Bad reactions to drugs

02:29.450 --> 02:30.582
They've purchased online.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.817
No one's died until now.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.919
The fda has
an investigative arm, oci.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.654
Why come to cyber?

02:35.656 --> 02:40.425
Are fraudulent ads on
the medical web site, scrollmd.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.828
<i>Over 800,000 people visit</i>
<i>the site a day,</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:45.397
<i>Most seeking a second opinion,</i>

02:45.399 --> 02:47.699
<i>Searching for general</i>
<i>health conditions,</i>

02:47.701 --> 02:49.334
Others for specific drugs.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.203
The site users are being lured

02:51.205 --> 02:53.472
To jpbpharmacy.Com
through these unauthorized ads.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.474
Ryan:
<i>The ads are redirecting</i>
<i>site users</i>

02:55.476 --> 02:56.842
<i>To what could be</i>

02:56.844 --> 02:58.277
A fictitious pharmacy.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.212
Sounds like
a click-baiting scheme.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.814
Tramizor is the drug
carl bruno ordered.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.183
It's used to treat
heart disease,

03:04.185 --> 03:05.717
But...

03:05.719 --> 03:07.719
The victim's

03:07.721 --> 03:09.855
Arterial walls show
considerable plaque build-up.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.723
The drug was ineffective.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.926
Because it had little to
no pharmacological ingredient.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.761
Carl bruno was duped into buying
what he thought

03:15.763 --> 03:18.564
<i>Was real tramizor,</i>
<i>when in fact it was placebo.</i>

03:18.566 --> 03:20.566
Ortega:
<i>Not just a placebo.</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:25.204
There's signs of inflammation
in the brain.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.539
Tox report revealed
trace amounts of aflatoxins.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.874
Fungus?

03:28.876 --> 03:29.908
Along with oxycodone.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.778
A pain reliever, mood enhancer.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.379
So the victims felt
like they were getting better

03:34.381 --> 03:35.747
While they were taking
the drugs,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.282
When actually they weren't.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.418
Carl bruno's death

03:39.420 --> 03:41.386
Wasn't an accident.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.289
It was homicide.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.261
What's the latest
on the scrollmd web site?

03:49.263 --> 03:50.862
Html injection.

03:50.864 --> 03:51.964
Check it out.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.398
Someone hacked a curtain ad

03:53.400 --> 03:54.666
On the scrollmd site.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.635
It looks like
a normal ad, right?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.804
And this is the code
for the ad,

03:58.806 --> 04:00.739
But peekaboo.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.476
Two codes written right on top
of each other.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.677
Nelson:
A click-baiting scheme.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.012
Right, like avery predicted,

04:07.014 --> 04:10.515
And if you toggle between them,
the fake ad

04:10.517 --> 04:12.251
Is masking
the legitimate ad.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.353
The target had to breach
the scrollmd servers

04:14.355 --> 04:15.821
To inject this code.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.689
So scrollmd wasn't aware
of the intrusion?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.858
No, and it's not just
about the ads.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.860
It's about how people
are getting to the ads.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.496
So if you search
"heart disease,"

04:24.498 --> 04:26.398
Like our vic,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.900
You get
the heart disease info page.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.602
Fine, okay,

04:30.604 --> 04:32.938
But if you search
general symptoms like "fatigue,"

04:32.940 --> 04:35.440
Or "nausea" and you click
around long enough,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.609
You end up...

04:37.611 --> 04:38.810
At the heart disease info page.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.412
Nelson:
Yeah, I tried it, too.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.847
I got this rash on my elbow.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.715
It-it's not on his elbow.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.384
Look, I searched "rash,"

04:45.386 --> 04:47.853
Then it took me down some
wormhole of related symptoms,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.888
And then eventually,
I ended up on a page

04:49.890 --> 04:51.723
That said I had cancer.
The algorithm takes

04:51.725 --> 04:53.992
<i>Any symptom and links it up</i>
<i>with a bunch of others.</i>

04:53.994 --> 04:55.494
<i>You type in "fatigue,"</i>

04:55.496 --> 04:57.863
<i>"insomnia," "dizziness,"</i>

04:57.865 --> 04:59.698
<i>You get "heart disease."</i>

04:59.700 --> 05:01.667
Next thing you know, you're
paranoid, self-diagnosing,

05:01.669 --> 05:03.669
Thinking you have symptoms
you don't even have.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.704
Taking advantage of the closet
hypochondriac in all of us.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.805
Exactly.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.373
Except in your case, nelson.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.708
I'd get that, uh,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.943
Elbow rash checked out.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.346
(softly):
What?

05:15.682 --> 05:18.083
So, our phony pharmacy is
not just selling tramizor.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.319
We've discovered
nine other drugs.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.587
<i>I got damitrol</i>
<i>for high blood pressure.</i>

05:22.589 --> 05:24.723
<i>Anfedril, that's diabetes.</i>

05:24.725 --> 05:27.025
<i>Lindrexia, that's that miracle</i>
<i>cancer drug.</i>

05:27.027 --> 05:28.960
How do you know so much
about prescription drugs?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.963
You know,
I like to stay informed.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.465
(chuckles)
you're a hypochondriac.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.033
No.
(grunts)

05:35.035 --> 05:37.002
As much as I love
being psychoanalyzed,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.870
We've got a target
that needs to be profiled.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.872
Okay, he, like you,
is organized,

05:40.874 --> 05:43.742
Ambitious, sophisticated,
tech-savvy.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.811
The drugs he's chosen
to distribute

05:45.813 --> 05:47.079
Are the most expensive

05:47.081 --> 05:48.814
And sought after
in their categories.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.982
Modern day snake
oil salesman.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.352
You know, it used to be these
guys were selling their wares

05:53.354 --> 05:54.853
Out of car trunks, and now...

05:54.855 --> 05:56.722
Well, this guy's masquerading
on the internet.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.390
He could have links
to organized crime.

05:58.392 --> 06:02.027
Gangs and cartels already have
distribution networks.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.662
Well, penalties

06:03.664 --> 06:05.030
For counterfeiting
pharmaceuticals

06:05.032 --> 06:07.799
Are less severe
than trafficking narcotics.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.035
You think he's trying to lure
people into the deep web?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.536
You know, that's the scary part.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.938
He doesn't have to.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.474
He's operating almost entirely
on the surface web,

06:15.476 --> 06:17.676
Where he can reach millions
of everyday citizens.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.111
Well, does that give us
a better chance

06:19.113 --> 06:20.979
Of drawing him
into the real world?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.914
Not necessarily.
Guys like him

06:22.916 --> 06:26.051
Know how to operate out in
the open without getting caught.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.019
Which, in a way,
makes him more elusive

06:28.021 --> 06:29.454
(phone rings)
and more dangerous.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.889
Sifter.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.958
Wait, who?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.926
She's here now?

06:34.928 --> 06:37.028
Uh, escort her up.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
(elevator bell dings)

06:43.703 --> 06:45.604
Mrs. Bruno,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.539
I'm assistant deputy
director simon sifter.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.008
This is special agent
avery ryan.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.977
The fda told me you were
handling my husband's case.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.944
Right, I am so sorry

06:52.946 --> 06:54.546
For your loss,
but I'm afraid

06:54.548 --> 06:56.148
We don't have
any answers yet.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.949
I had... I had to come.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.653
It's only natural
you'd have questions.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.855
It was me.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.957
I'm responsible
for my husband's death.

07:10.563 --> 07:13.064
I was the one who bought
the tramizor for carl.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.536
And his doctor prescribed
tramizor to prevent another one.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.704
Our insurance
plan changed.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.073
They didn't cover
this particular medication.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.042
We had to decide.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.045
Pay for carl's meds
or buy groceries.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.814
<i>So I went online.</i>

07:28.816 --> 07:30.982
<i>When I saw the ad for the</i>
<i>pharmacy, I was so relieved.</i>

07:30.984 --> 07:33.952
I just assumed that
because it was on scrollmd,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.153
It was safe.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.891
Carl was skeptical.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.761
He thought it was
too good to be true.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.196
But we were desperate,

07:44.198 --> 07:46.498
And when the pill
looked identical

07:46.500 --> 07:47.766
<i>To the real thing...</i>

07:47.768 --> 07:49.067
Sifter:
<i>Did you ever speak</i>

07:49.069 --> 07:50.469
With anybody or attempt

07:50.471 --> 07:52.737
To contact the pharmacy
by phone or...?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.840
My only contact was online.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.242
I was so stupid to trust
this web site,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.978
And I printed every receipt
and e-mail.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.747
I looked for anything
to help your investigation.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.550
Jpb pharmacy.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.818
We were on a monthly plan.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.920
They delivered
that package yesterday.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.622
Hmm, no return address,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.224
But there is a return zip code.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.162
Nelson:
<i>This is what we got?</i>

08:17.164 --> 08:19.898
562 I.P. Addresses on a map?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.567
To hunt down one zip code
on a postmark?

08:22.569 --> 08:24.803
Yep, avery wants us
to filter this down

08:24.805 --> 08:26.538
To the one machine
that stamped this package

08:26.540 --> 08:28.240
By the time she lands
in san antonio.

08:28.242 --> 08:29.875
Okay.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.810
Tell you what.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.011
We'll take turns
filtering the data.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.679
First one to get stumped

08:34.681 --> 08:36.581
Takes the late shift
for three weekends straight.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.250
Okay, I'll go first.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.852
Let's nix all the machines
with I.P. Addresses

08:40.854 --> 08:43.889
Executive assistants
and guys in the mail room

08:43.891 --> 08:46.191
Probably aren't
counterfeit drug lords.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.227
218 gone.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.963
The machines record the weight
and postage of each package.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.766
So let's just eliminate all the
ones that only sent out letters.

08:59.839 --> 09:00.939
Bam.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.073
Beat that.
Okay.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.875
Package cost $1.82.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.645
We just eliminate any machine
that didn't record $1.82.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.179
Okay?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.849
Okay, big bro,
let me run with that.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.951
The meter stamp also has a date,

09:12.953 --> 09:14.286
And since we already
know the postage,

09:14.288 --> 09:16.021
$1.82.
We can eliminate

09:16.023 --> 09:18.056
Any machine that didn't record
that amount

09:18.058 --> 09:19.024
On this same date.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.825
That's only four left.

09:20.827 --> 09:21.993
I got this.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.995
I got this, I got this.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.331
Package weighs

09:26.333 --> 09:27.933
5.3 ounces.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.869
Meter machine is accurate
to a tenth of an ounce.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.137
So which of the remaining
four machines sent out

09:32.139 --> 09:34.973
A package costing $1.82
weighing 5.3 ounces

09:34.975 --> 09:36.141
On this exact date?

09:36.143 --> 09:39.044
Mm-hmm.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.280
(grunts)

09:42.282 --> 09:43.281
Yeah!
That's what

09:43.283 --> 09:47.218
Go ahead and pull up that
internet service provider, man.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.120
Okay, I'm getting the
hard location for
the I.P. Address now.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.355
Looks like you're gonna be

09:50.357 --> 09:51.823
Enjoying the late shift,
my friend.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.758
Who, me?
Yeah, you.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.994
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.330
Oh, got an address.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.865
Avery, it's me.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.034
<i>545 oakland way, san antonio.</i>

10:05.771 --> 10:07.839
â™ª

10:16.115 --> 10:17.616
Fbi! Open up!

10:23.122 --> 10:25.190
â™ª

10:44.777 --> 10:46.978
Ryan:
Show me your hands!

10:51.951 --> 10:54.019
Turn around slowly.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.700
Ryan:
<i>I have a theory, paul.</i>

11:08.702 --> 11:11.136
You tell me
if I'm in the ballpark.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.139
You're involved with an illegal
prescription drug ring,

11:14.141 --> 11:16.074
Scamming people
over the internet.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.877
You're not the boss,
you're just a middleman.

11:18.879 --> 11:22.847
You took this job
not for the money,

11:22.849 --> 11:24.315
But because you need access

11:24.317 --> 11:26.184
To the same drugs
you're distributing.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.687
I'm assuming
lindrexia?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.455
You have cancer?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.757
Oh, congratulations.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.092
You get a gold star.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.226
Mundo:
Paul, the drugs
you're taking

11:35.228 --> 11:37.162
Are counterfeit.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.830
They're full
of toxic contaminants

11:38.832 --> 11:40.031
That are making you sicker.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.133
That's not true,
I'm feeling better.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.369
That's because they're
also laced with oxycodone.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.438
That's what's
relieving your pain,

11:46.440 --> 11:47.872
Making you feel euphoric.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.408
I'm getting better.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.476
I know I am.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.013
Have to be.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.048
How were you first contacted
about this job?

11:57.050 --> 12:00.885
I met a guy on a cancer support
chat group online.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.756
Said he had access
to black market lindrexia

12:04.758 --> 12:06.091
And said I could have some

12:06.093 --> 12:07.759
If I helped him
distribute it.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.928
Did you ever meet
with him in person?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.229
No. Never.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.130
It was always a dead drop.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.432
No one was
ever there.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.035
Lung cancer.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.105
Kicked it twice.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.440
It came back a third time.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.276
I asked my doctors
for lindrexia,

12:25.278 --> 12:27.445
And they said no.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.115
See, the thing is,
it's a miracle drug,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.816
But that miracle's
only approved

12:31.818 --> 12:34.152
For first and
second-line patients.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.855
If you're a third-timer like me,

12:36.857 --> 12:39.124
Well, you're crap out of luck.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.193
Doctors say
I'm a lost cause.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.528
Well, it's not just
phony lindrexia

12:43.530 --> 12:45.196
That you're shipping out.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.331
There are nine other drugs,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.199
One of them a heart medication.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.200
Killed a man

12:49.202 --> 12:53.037
Well, the packages I get
are already sealed.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.974
My job is just to stamp 'em
and ship 'em out.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.842
Well, this is, this is
just supposed to be

12:57.844 --> 12:59.911
A way around the drug companies.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.049
I just wanted to help people.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.255
(crying):
Just wanted to help people.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.458
And now you're telling me
I killed a man?

13:15.561 --> 13:17.162
Guy who died?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.265
How old was he?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.133
He was about your age.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.068
Figures.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.039
Death always finds a way.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.176
(coughing)

13:31.178 --> 13:33.444
Are you okay, paul?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.013
I'm fine.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.182
I'm gonna get you some water.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.152
I just need a minute.

13:53.599 --> 13:54.599
(thud)

13:54.601 --> 13:56.601
(glass shattering)

13:56.603 --> 13:58.136
No, no, no, no!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.103
No, no!
We need some help in here!

13:59.105 --> 14:01.906
(cell phone dialing)
yeah, I need an ambulance.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.608
545 oakland way.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.276
Paul:
Ah... No...

14:08.981 --> 14:10.415
Stay with me, paul,
stay with me.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.016
Paul, stay with me!

14:16.388 --> 14:22.594
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

14:24.463 --> 14:30.235
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

14:30.237 --> 14:34.405
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

14:34.407 --> 14:37.942
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

14:37.944 --> 14:42.313
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

14:42.315 --> 14:45.984
â™ª and miles...

14:45.986 --> 14:48.353
â™ª oh, yeah.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.009
(indistinct radio transmission)

15:17.549 --> 15:18.917
You okay?

15:19.685 --> 15:21.252
Yeah.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.621
Our target's a twisted
son of a bitch.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.556
He's not just
cheating sick people,

15:25.558 --> 15:27.525
He's using the most desperate
ones to do his dirty work.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.461
Why hire a guy like paul?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.196
Because he was hopeful.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.999
Paul wasn't doing it
for the money.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.501
He wouldn't ask any questions.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.669
He just wanted to live.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.404
He just wanted everyone to live.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.140
Which tells me that
our target is a sociopath,

15:42.142 --> 15:44.442
Lacking empathy
and remorse.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.945
He didn't care that paul
was a cancer victim;

15:46.947 --> 15:49.580
He just saw him as a pawn
that could be manipulated

15:49.582 --> 15:51.582
And controlled.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.017
You still think
our target's part of

15:53.019 --> 15:54.619
An organized crime ring?
If he were,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.956
He'd have a member of his crew
doing that job.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.659
Our target is running
a much leaner operation.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.398
So lean our only lead
is on his way to the icu.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.568
Well, maybe paul's phone
could do the talking.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.507
Paul mentioned something
about a dead drop,

16:16.509 --> 16:18.476
Where he was picking up
the pills.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.348
I'll pull up his
"frequent locations."

16:23.350 --> 16:24.382
Show me "journey mode."

16:25.451 --> 16:26.551
You're checking for a pattern.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.618
Yeah.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.464
There.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.565
On the days that
paul left his house,

16:40.567 --> 16:42.567
He never left
before noon.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.035
Looks like
he averaged

16:44.037 --> 16:45.636
Five or six stops.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.572
Mundo: Except right here.
Once a week, he'd leave

16:47.574 --> 16:48.673
The house, make one
stop at 9:00 a.M.,

16:48.675 --> 16:51.175
Drive directly back.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.578
Ryan:
That's got to be

16:53.580 --> 16:54.712
The address of
the dead drop location.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.481
Mundo:
According to this schedule,

16:56.483 --> 16:57.482
Next pickup's not
for another three days.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.386
We have to pull the traffic cam
footage of the area.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.720
If paul was picking up drugs,

17:02.722 --> 17:03.788
Someone was dropping them off.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.156
Do you think
this is where

17:05.158 --> 17:06.324
Our target surfaced
in the real world?

17:06.326 --> 17:09.093
There's only one way
to find out.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.666
And you're sure about this?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.802
Yeah. My techs
confirmed it today.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.171
It's an html
injection on your site

17:20.173 --> 17:23.674
That's causing site visitors
to access malicious ads.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.678
Well, my network security
is top-notch.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.214
We'll have to look into this
and make sure it's accurate.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.250
Marcus,

17:32.252 --> 17:34.185
All due respect--
it's accurate.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.087
Your security has gaping holes.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.723
Look, I'm here as a friend.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.060
But I just felt this
was something best explained

17:42.062 --> 17:43.261
In person.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.329
Well, pardon me
if I hesitate to thank you.

17:45.331 --> 17:49.133
Look, I don't want scrollmd
to face any undo embarrassment,

17:49.135 --> 17:52.670
So just, please, take down
the infected ads immediately

17:52.672 --> 17:54.739
And have your techs
scrub your servers

17:54.741 --> 17:56.174
For any other malicious code.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.509
Sure, fine.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.710
Anything else?

17:59.712 --> 18:00.678
Uh, yeah, actually.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.246
Consider reaching out

18:02.248 --> 18:04.415
To the victim's wife,
jane bruno.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.716
Extend your
condolences.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.652
Most importantly,

18:07.654 --> 18:10.588
Issue a public warning
on your home page.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.723
That's the most efficient way
of reaching people

18:12.725 --> 18:14.692
Who might have these drugs
currently sitting

18:14.694 --> 18:15.760
In their medicine
cabinets.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.596
No, that's a step
too far, simon.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.834
A-a public warning
saying that we were breached?

18:22.836 --> 18:25.503
It would create a pr
nightmare for us.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.271
Not to mention it opens
us up to liability.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.372
The widow could sue.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.208
I could lose millions
in sponsors.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.110
A man died because
of your web site.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.412
And I feel badly about that.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.646
But scrollmd was a victim, too.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.316
Our web site
was attacked.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.717
I can't issue that warning.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.452
You can't or you won't?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.787
(sighs)

18:42.789 --> 18:44.422
I won't.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.366
It shows the entrance
to the dead drop location.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.701
Take me back to the time
of the last pickup.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.703
Okay.

19:05.277 --> 19:06.310
Mundo:
There's paul.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.812
9:00 a.M. On the dot.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.782
We're looking for anyone else
going in or out that door.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.919
There.
Rewind that.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.755
Play that back.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.292
Mundo:
You gotta be kidding me.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.794
The target's using
an ir led array.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.497
Makes his license plate
unreadable to cameras.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.701
Can we make an id?

19:30.703 --> 19:31.903
Let's see here...

19:37.809 --> 19:38.809
No.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.879
Can't see his face.
Too far away.

19:43.815 --> 19:44.815
What is it?

19:48.820 --> 19:50.755
Our target was driving
a newer model suv,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.523
Probably equipped
with bluetooth.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.493
Mundo:
<i>All four tires give off</i>
<i>bluetooth signals</i>

19:55.495 --> 19:56.661
<i>To report when they're</i>
<i>low on pressure.</i>

19:56.663 --> 19:57.795
Ryan:
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

19:57.797 --> 20:00.231
See that little
white box right there?

20:01.366 --> 20:02.900
It's a department
of transportation

20:02.902 --> 20:04.602
Traffic monitoring
system.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.738
<i>Picks up bluetooth signals</i>
<i>to report traffic patterns.</i>

20:07.740 --> 20:09.607
<i>The d.O.T. Keeps a record</i>

20:09.609 --> 20:11.342
Of every bluetooth device
it pairs with.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.344
That's our digital
fingerprint.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.646
We match that to the
suv's vin number,

20:15.648 --> 20:18.916
And we get the driver's id
and registration from the dmv.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.451
Yeah, only one problem--

20:20.453 --> 20:22.520
The d.O.T. Only keeps
the data for 20 minutes.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.855
(chuckling):
You really believe that?

20:29.394 --> 20:31.729
Bluetooth is
a hacker's best friend.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.898
What time was the ir
led flash detected

20:33.900 --> 20:34.765
By the traffic cam?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.534
6:49 a.M.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.536
Sifter:
Can you put the newscast
on the big screen?

20:38.538 --> 20:41.539
Okay, these are the bluetooth
devices that paired

20:41.541 --> 20:44.542
With the d.O.T. Traffic
box at the same time.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.978
170? We making
another wager?

20:46.980 --> 20:48.946
Looks like it.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.816
You should be able to trust
the web sites you visit.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.751
They should be responsible

20:53.753 --> 20:57.255
For the content of the ads
that are on their sites.

20:57.257 --> 21:01.259
My husband is dead because
someone was negligent.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.928
Today I went
to scrollmd headquarters.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.563
No one would talk to me.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.398
They escorted me out.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.899
They say they're
all about helping people,

21:08.901 --> 21:10.968
But all they care about is
the bottom line.

21:13.405 --> 21:17.441
Krumitz:
Hey, I've got
something here.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.676
All right,
talk to me.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.677
We just ran
the vin number

21:19.679 --> 21:22.813
Through the texas dmv database
and got a hit.

21:22.815 --> 21:23.981
All right, get avery
on the phone.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.785
Nelson, I've got
a job for you.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.954
Come see me in my
office after this.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.989
You don't want krumitz
to come, too?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.891
I mean, because we've been
tag-teaming everything.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.326
Just you.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.527
Krumitz:
Simon?

21:37.929 --> 21:38.929
Avery,

21:38.931 --> 21:41.699
We found the driver of the suv.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.868
Target's name is randall fung.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.892
Fbi!

22:07.894 --> 22:08.959
Go, go, go!

22:09.895 --> 22:10.961
My side's clear!

22:10.963 --> 22:12.863
Shooters come out.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.700
All clear, sir,
totally clear!

22:16.635 --> 22:18.703
(glass shatters)

22:29.715 --> 22:31.048
Fbi!

22:31.050 --> 22:32.717
Hands up, let me
see your hands!

22:32.719 --> 22:33.884
Fbi! Don't move!

22:33.886 --> 22:35.052
Get down, get down!
On your knees!

22:35.054 --> 22:36.487
Do not move!

22:36.489 --> 22:38.022
(agent shouts
indistinctly)

22:38.990 --> 22:40.591
Hands behind your back!

22:45.464 --> 22:46.897
Randall fung,
turn around.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.133
Hands behind
your back.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.042
Mold.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.810
The aflatoxins.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.812
This is what's making
the victims sick.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.013
I've seen some nasty-ass crap,

23:03.015 --> 23:04.749
But this is disgusting.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.763
You keep looking at the pills,
not the computer.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.164
You know what
that tells me?

23:20.166 --> 23:24.135
That you're a trained chemist,
not a cyber criminal.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.570
Which means you're
only half this operation.

23:26.572 --> 23:30.007
Randall, we got you
on fraud, conspiracy,

23:30.009 --> 23:32.676
Trafficking counterfeit goods,
and a man died

23:32.678 --> 23:34.078
Because of
what you did.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.814
You're looking at murder
and a hell of a lot of jail time

23:36.816 --> 23:38.916
Unless you can tell us
where your better half is.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.086
Now, if you talk,
maybe we can make a deal.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.560
Bag the computers and devices
and bring them back to d.C.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.896
We're still looking
for the head of this snake.

24:08.513 --> 24:11.081
(car chirps)
marcus:
What the hell did you do, simon?

24:11.083 --> 24:16.187
Is this a discussion we should
be having by my parking space?

24:16.189 --> 24:17.988
My entire web
site is down.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.757
Every time I text, try
to get it back online,

24:19.759 --> 24:21.559
It crashes again.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.895
Sounds like a distributed
denial of service attack.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.164
Ah, those can take days,
weeks to sort out.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.033
I can certainly have
my team look into it.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.035
Your team? You
son of a bitch.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.171
And I'm guessing you
also had something to do

24:34.173 --> 24:36.207
With the media attack carl
bruno's wife has been waging.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.742
Hey, look at that,
you do know the victim's name.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.077
What do you
want, simon?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.745
Same thing
jane bruno wants--

24:41.747 --> 24:43.747
For you and scrollmd
to be held accountable.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.049
And maybe if you spoke
with her

24:45.051 --> 24:47.051
Instead of just
escorting her out...

24:47.053 --> 24:49.086
I am not gonna
negotiate with you.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.755
You know, marcus,
in the next few weeks,

24:51.757 --> 24:53.757
It's gonna be more than
your site that's crashing.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.192
That's not a threat,
that's reality.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.727
Who knows
what's next?

24:56.729 --> 24:58.095
Dirty vaccines?

24:58.097 --> 24:59.697
Tainted antibiotics?

24:59.699 --> 25:02.700
Millions of people visit
your site every month.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.868
And whether
they get cured

25:03.870 --> 25:07.204
Or they get killed
might just depend on you.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.093
Look, I know they scrubbed
these devices of mold and spores

25:29.095 --> 25:32.696
And whatnot, but, uh, I am
starting to itch a little bit.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.100
Wait.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.835
Wait, w-wait.
Hold up.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.670
Go back.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.238
Look familiar to you?

25:43.141 --> 25:45.976
Both paul and randall had the
exact same online poker site

25:45.978 --> 25:47.278
Bookmarked on
their devices.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.712
Could be
a coincidence.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.014
Yeah, we were
thinking that, too.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.016
Until we checked the user
history on both devices,

25:52.018 --> 25:53.551
We stopped
thinking that.

25:54.986 --> 25:56.587
Mundo: All right,
for the last two months,

25:56.589 --> 25:57.688
Both these guys logged on

25:57.690 --> 26:00.691
To the same poker site
every Saturday.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.226
Were they playing each other?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.895
No, but look where they sat.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.931
Mundo:
A no-limit, heads-up table.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.999
<i>Means they each played</i>
<i>an opponent one-on-one.</i>

26:18.743 --> 26:21.078
Krumitz: <i>And for no more</i>
<i>than three minutes.</i>

26:21.080 --> 26:22.580
Three minutes?
Mm-hmm.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.114
That's barely enough time
to play one hand.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.116
True, but that's
all they ever play.

26:26.118 --> 26:30.120
I mean, you log in, sit,
play a hand, win, log out.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.590
(snaps) paul and randall
weren't playing poker.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.626
<i>They were getting paid</i>
<i>for their services.</i>

26:37.963 --> 26:41.031
<i>This is how our target</i>
<i>pays his crew.</i>

26:54.079 --> 26:56.914
I bet this is also
how our target washes his money.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.983
Hackers love using online poker
to launder funds.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.317
It's hard to track.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.386
But not impossible.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.168
You still want to argue
you're not a hypochondriac?

27:18.170 --> 27:20.170
This is not about me.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.840
Oh, my wife, she hates shots.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.209
And the doctor put her
on these pills for the flu.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.778
A preventative measure because
of her weakened immune system.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.280
I don't know, just being
cautious, I guess.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.851
Kathryn's doctor
prescribed her phony meds?

27:33.853 --> 27:35.352
Hearing jane
bruno's story,

27:35.354 --> 27:37.354
I mean, this could
happen to anyone.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.257
Yesterday, I met an
intelligent qualified doctor

27:40.259 --> 27:42.092
Who fell down a
slippery slope

27:42.094 --> 27:44.194
And ended up in
the target's trap.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.964
There's a nationwide
shortage of doxaflu.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.265
Yeah, it's just
hard to believe

27:48.267 --> 27:50.067
Your only option was
an online pharmacy.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.369
I have high-risk
patients--

27:52.371 --> 27:54.104
Children,
pregnant women,

27:54.106 --> 27:55.939
The elderly.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.042
I wanted to make sure
that my patients were protected.

27:58.044 --> 28:01.311
Yeah, I mean, look, I
know we need to be able

28:01.313 --> 28:05.115
To trust in certain
things-- doctors, medicine.

28:05.117 --> 28:09.186
When our target's taking
advantage of that trust.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.189
And now, besides the nine
pharmaceutical drugs

28:12.191 --> 28:13.857
Our target was
distributing,

28:13.859 --> 28:16.360
He's escalated to a
common flu medication.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.295
He's expanding
his business.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.198
Sounds to me like
he's looking for a big payday

28:21.200 --> 28:22.700
So he can cash out
and run.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.368
Yeah, how do we get
to him before he does?

28:24.370 --> 28:27.137
So, based on your previous
psychological profile

28:27.139 --> 28:29.807
Of the target, can you build
a physical description?

28:29.809 --> 28:31.308
Well, our target is
most likely male

28:31.310 --> 28:35.012
<i>Based on his tech skills</i>
<i>and his sociopathic tendencies.</i>

28:35.014 --> 28:36.914
He sees people as dollar signs.

28:36.916 --> 28:40.017
He has no empathy,
no conscience.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.752
Age range?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.287
Coders fall into one
of four categories--

28:43.289 --> 28:45.856
Young adolescents, college
students, professionals,

28:45.858 --> 28:49.026
Or mature and reformed
ex-virus writers.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.495
But our target is
a professional.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.398
Which puts him in the early 20s
to mid-40s range.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.300
He's made an art
of blending in.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.001
Hiding in plain sight.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.170
He's average looking,
inconspicuous.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.773
He won't wear his hair
too long or too short.

29:02.775 --> 29:05.109
He's likely to have
poor social skills.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.111
A recluse.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.113
He won't want to leave home
unless he has to.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.281
He likes to live his life
behind a computer screen.

29:11.283 --> 29:14.017
But if he does leave the house,
he'll want to disguise himself.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.320
But nothing that draws
too much attention.

29:16.322 --> 29:17.488
Glasses.

29:17.490 --> 29:18.922
<i>With thick frames.</i>

29:18.924 --> 29:20.424
<i>He likes to have a barrier</i>
<i>between himself</i>

29:20.426 --> 29:22.459
And the rest
of the world.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.994
It gives him
a false sense of security.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.462
All right, what
do we got?

29:25.464 --> 29:28.398
Male, 20s to 40s, glasses,
hair medium length.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.200
That is not a whole
lot to go on.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.201
It's enough.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.503
We will know him
when we see him.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.404
Now we just have
to give him a reason

29:34.406 --> 29:36.273
To pop out
into the real world.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.474
How do you propose
we do that?

29:37.476 --> 29:39.476
Money.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.011
I need $250,000.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.280
Uh, for what
exactly, avery?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.449
A little game
of poker.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.293
All right, everybody, listen up.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.828
Time to put your game face on.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.496
Once our target

29:59.498 --> 30:00.430
Receives a big payment,

30:00.432 --> 30:01.565
He's gonna launder it using

30:01.567 --> 30:03.066
The same online poker site

30:03.068 --> 30:04.234
He used to pay his crew.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.805
And he's gonna be fast,
but we're gonna be faster.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.506
Avery, you sure this is
a good idea?

30:09.508 --> 30:11.074
Our target's gonna know
we're not a doctor's office.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.342
He's gonna trace
that quarter mil

30:12.344 --> 30:15.379
Our raid on his pill factory
put him on the ropes.

30:15.381 --> 30:18.515
He's gonna want
to cash out and run,

30:18.517 --> 30:20.484
Even if he knows
it's government coin.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.320
He's compulsive,
overconfident and self-serving.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.322
He's always looking
for his next big score.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.857
And you think
he's gonna make a mistake?

30:26.859 --> 30:28.392
A mistake born of greed.

30:28.394 --> 30:31.161
He made a fortune preying
on the weaknesses of others.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.329
And we're gonna catch him

30:32.331 --> 30:35.032
Because his weakness
is he's cocky.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.333
(grunts)

30:36.335 --> 30:38.468
Here goes nothing.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.939
We just bought
$250,000 worth of drugs.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.341
Krumitz, you're up.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.176
Okay.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.046
Our target uses
a dollar dispatch account

30:49.048 --> 30:50.280
For his pharmacy transactions.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.416
No previous history.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.550
It's a one-off account.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.519
Nelson:
Uh-huh.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.523
Krumitz: Nobody freak out.
It's about to disappear.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.391
Nelson:
Our target is opening
a new dollar dispatch account

31:01.393 --> 31:03.527
For every drug transaction.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.362
Nelson?
All right.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.496
Here we go. So, our target's

31:06.498 --> 31:08.098
Favorite online poker site.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.566
Now, we have full
administrative privileges,

31:09.568 --> 31:11.401
Which means
we're like the pit boss.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.936
We can see whatever screen
we want.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.338
Pull up the lobby.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.307
Go to the no limit,
heads-up tables.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.509
The target should buy in
for $250k.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.515
Wait for it.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.535
There he is! Phantom23.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.503
(group cheering)

31:49.307 --> 31:51.208
He's at table 26.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.216
He's going all in
on that first hand.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.389
Nelson: He just folded

32:05.391 --> 32:06.456
On a full house.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.258
Remember, every time he loses,

32:08.260 --> 32:09.960
He's really losing to himself.

32:09.962 --> 32:12.296
With every hand, he's laundering
the money one step further.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.164
Odyssey45 is just another handle

32:14.166 --> 32:15.599
He created for himself

32:15.601 --> 32:17.467
In the poker game.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.707
All right, he's on the move.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.342
Who's got eyes on odyssey45?

32:25.344 --> 32:28.312
I do. He's at table 84.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.579
Krumitz:
He's on the move again

32:29.581 --> 32:31.081
As emerald62.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.316
There he is, table nine.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.419
Wait, he's not going
all in anymore.

32:38.423 --> 32:39.656
Ryan: Sneaky sucker.
He divided the money

32:39.658 --> 32:41.291
So it's harder to track.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.993
He's jumping tables again.

32:51.102 --> 32:54.571
Nelson: Damn it. Look,
there's, like, four of them.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.707
Remember, he's playing
against himself.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.086
Krumitz:
<i>He's playing at more tables.</i>

33:10.621 --> 33:13.523
Nelson:
<i>That's six.</i>

33:15.259 --> 33:16.593
Now eight.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.595
16.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.730
He's using an algorithm.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.533
Just stay with him.
Just isolate

33:23.535 --> 33:24.601
The games our target's playing.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.069
He's moving too fast.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.304
Do not lose him.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.538
Wait, look at his bets.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.240
He's going all in again there
and there.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.575
Sifter: Yeah, he's recombining
his laundered assets.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.311
He's getting ready to cash out.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.718
Look for a player
who starts to dominate.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.753
I think I got him, hydrus99.

33:42.755 --> 33:45.655
Earnings just climbed
to $159,000.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.724
Krumitz, trace the
bank account link to hydrus99.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.127
He'll have to show
at the bank in person

33:50.129 --> 33:51.795
To cash out.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.297
I can't. There's a, there's
a separation of privileges

33:54.299 --> 33:55.732
On this server.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.168
Green's what the players
can access,

33:58.170 --> 33:59.503
Yellow's administrator access,

33:59.505 --> 34:00.670
And red's where the
bank accounts are stored.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.707
We should have access
to both yellow and red.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.042
I specifically asked for it.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.744
I know,
but I can't access the red.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.513
There's a whole extra layer
of encryption.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.415
Wait, wait, wait.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.783
I think I can get in, but it's
gonna have to authenticate me.

34:12.785 --> 34:14.451
It's gonna take some time.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.552
Mundo:
Time we don't have.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.621
He's up to $184,000.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.796
$202,000.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.335
Guys, come on,
he hits 250, he's gone.

34:32.337 --> 34:33.603
Look, we don't have time.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.704
Look, we have to hack it.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.473
Just do it.
There's a bridge

34:36.475 --> 34:39.776
We have to ride one of them
from yellow to red.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.812
Yeah.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.423
Mundo: He did it.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.658
He hit $250,000.

35:12.710 --> 35:15.745
Did we get it?

35:15.747 --> 35:18.715
Sorry, we, uh,
we couldn't, um...

35:20.885 --> 35:22.752
Mundo:
Wait a minute.

35:22.754 --> 35:23.820
That's it? It's...

35:23.822 --> 35:25.622
He's gone? It's over?

35:41.706 --> 35:44.608
No. No.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.843
There still might be
a trace of him in the system.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.179
Because his winnings
in the yellow zone

35:49.181 --> 35:51.381
With his bank account
in the red zone.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.816
That's our bridge.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.751
We need to plant a bug
in that line of communication.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.919
We can ride it into the red

35:55.921 --> 35:59.256
Ryan: Infect the
firewall with a virus.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.811
Yeah! Holy crap, we did it.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.213
(applause)

36:23.215 --> 36:24.781
The target's bank account

36:24.783 --> 36:26.883
Is at keymark bank,
lexington, kentucky.

36:26.885 --> 36:27.784
Yes.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.288
Woman:
Nice work, nelson.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.289
(laughter)

36:32.291 --> 36:34.624
Good work.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.193
It's after banking hours,

36:36.195 --> 36:38.695
Which means our target can't
cash out till the morning.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.230
Let's be there when he does.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.646
I'd like to close
my account.

36:56.648 --> 36:57.681
Your account number?

37:03.688 --> 37:05.522
That's a lot of money.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.790
Looking to make
a fresh start.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.559
I'd like that in
a cashier's check.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.019
(gasps)

37:36.721 --> 37:38.021
(screams)

37:39.657 --> 37:40.857
(grunting)

37:42.260 --> 37:43.793
Okay, okay.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.003
Shawn morris,

37:53.005 --> 37:56.573
Looks like the last life
you gambled away was yours.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.765
All right, hey!

38:21.767 --> 38:23.033
To an epic win today.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.401
Cheers!

38:24.403 --> 38:27.070
Cheers.
Sifter:
Good work, people.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.039
All right, you know
we made the same toast

38:29.041 --> 38:30.807
When we busted you, right?
(chuckles)

38:30.809 --> 38:34.511
Look, I'm nothing like
the guy we arrested today, okay?

38:34.513 --> 38:36.012
Shawn morris,
guy's like a sociopath.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.347
Probably still lives
in the basement

38:37.349 --> 38:38.815
With his parents,
never been near a girl,

38:38.817 --> 38:41.885
And hacking the new york stock
exchange was any different?

38:41.887 --> 38:42.919
It was.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.688
His code killed people; my code

38:44.690 --> 38:45.955
Just made bankers
and stockholders mad

38:45.957 --> 38:47.957
For a day or two.
So, then he was a black hat

38:47.959 --> 38:50.060
With bad intentions,
and you were what?

38:50.062 --> 38:51.695
An innovator.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.762
A revolutionary.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.897
Sounds like you're just a guy

38:53.899 --> 38:55.065
Talking a whole bunch of smack.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.100
Smack!
See, you got to know

38:57.102 --> 38:59.069
What it's like on the other side
to know what I'm talking about.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.737
But don't get me wrong,
it feels good to know

39:00.739 --> 39:03.606
That we did save lives by,
you know, getting over a hundred

39:03.608 --> 39:05.075
Contaminated drugs
off the streets.

39:05.077 --> 39:07.544
Yep, stopped it
before it became an epidemic.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.745
That's how we do, son.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.014
That's right, baby.
Mm.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.349
Got to go.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.750
I got daddy duty.

39:13.752 --> 39:14.984
Good work.
All right.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.920
Man's a superhero with a kid.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.955
(chuckles)
hey, I thought
you drank everything

39:18.957 --> 39:21.057
In those 82-ounce cups.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.892
They're not that big.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.096
Marcus:
Today I am proud to announce

39:26.098 --> 39:28.765
That scrollmd will be
the first web site

39:28.767 --> 39:31.468
Of its kind to issue
a public warning

39:31.470 --> 39:35.105
On its home page alerting users
to the dangers

39:35.107 --> 39:37.006
Of fraudulent
online advertising.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.575
We will also lead

39:38.577 --> 39:40.610
An initiative in congress

39:40.612 --> 39:43.580
To ensure that
all health web sites maintain

39:43.582 --> 39:44.581
A higher level of security.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.116
That was you, wasn't it?

39:46.118 --> 39:47.417
Anchor:
We'll be following that story
as it progresses...

39:47.419 --> 39:48.818
Well, I did apply

39:48.820 --> 39:50.620
A little pressure.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.123
And how is kathryn? Is she
still under the weather?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.824
I just texted her.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.660
She's-she's much better, thanks.
Yeah, I may be

39:57.662 --> 39:59.062
Coming down
with the same thing she's got.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.096
I got kind of an itchy throat.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.998
You know?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.501
Oh, please, don't start.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.770
(chuckles)
to our health.
