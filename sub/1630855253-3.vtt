WEBVTT

00:18.560 --> 00:20.061
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:21.563 --> 00:22.522
Get over it.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.773
Up. Up.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.610
No time. I'm going through it.
-You're what?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.071
It's not just a watch list.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.699
That NSA facility's been monitoring
everything we do.

00:32.782 --> 00:36.036
We gotta expose their lies
and the people who are telling them,

00:36.119 --> 00:38.163
starting with that guy in charge,
Robert Vance.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.998
They have Vance's son.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.751
Who sent you here? Michaela?
You tell that traitor--

00:42.834 --> 00:44.127
-Ah!
-Let him go!

00:45.628 --> 00:47.005
You're from 828 too?

00:48.381 --> 00:51.301
Yeah. You seeing what I'm seeing?

00:52.594 --> 00:55.055
I'm not ready to die, Bill. Please.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.974
-Who said anything about dying?

01:35.845 --> 01:38.098
I understand that her case
is officially closed,

01:38.181 --> 01:40.850
but I have new information
that proves my daughter is alive

01:40.934 --> 01:42.769
and possibly still in New York.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.230
No, no, no, don't transfer me.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.067
I've already talked to that division.
They won't see me until--

01:49.567 --> 01:51.069
Idiots. No offense.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.695
Well, I'm not NYPD anymore.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.199
Can Zeke force someone else
to feel empathy?

01:56.282 --> 01:59.661
It's not how his skills roll,
but I can call him and tell him--

01:59.744 --> 02:02.705
What I need is the police
to follow this lead before it gets cold.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.792
-Have you tried calling Jared again?
-Yeah. Again and again and again.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.710
Okay. Well, look, I'm here for you.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.213
Cal and Olive,
they're ready to jump in and--

02:13.842 --> 02:15.718
You didn't hear that, the thunder?

02:15.802 --> 02:16.845
I didn't hear a thing.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.644
It must have been a Calling, then.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.313
It has nothing to do with Eden.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.233
How can you say that? You just had
a Calling that led you to Eden.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.819
No, a Calling took me
a few feet away from Eden.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.155
-It could've taken me straight to her.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.616
I figured out Eden was staying at Anna's
because of Aaron Glover and your husband,

02:38.700 --> 02:41.452
but now we have
real-world information to follow.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.086
-Sending that to Saanvi?
-Mm-hmm.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.631
You know, that scar looks pretty badass.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.634
Kinda like a tough guy, you know?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.553
Makes you look streetwise.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.929
It really doesn't.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.766
Henry told me that I was a dragon
before this transferred to me.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.727
I think you'd make a cool dragon.

03:05.810 --> 03:09.981
Well, I'm a guy who disappeared
and then came back five years older

03:10.064 --> 03:13.401
with no memory of where I was
or why I was there.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.862
Doesn't sound too dragon-y to me.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.699
Well, maybe the scar's
supposed to help you figure that out.

03:19.782 --> 03:24.204
I don't know. Just feels like
I'm treasure hunting without a map.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.372
So you're saying<i>…</i>

03:45.266 --> 03:47.644
I was teaching that to Eden before.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.687
God, I feel awful

03:50.313 --> 03:52.482
that I told Dad to let go,

03:53.274 --> 03:55.652
to accept that Eden's gone.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.153
We both did.

04:01.783 --> 04:06.329
When you were gone,
no matter what anybody said,

04:06.412 --> 04:07.622
I…

04:08.915 --> 04:11.334
I always knew
that you were still out there.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.087
I knew that you were still alive.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.923
With Eden,

04:17.840 --> 04:20.009
I've never felt that.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.345
Still don't.

04:22.845 --> 04:27.558
Hey. Team Attic needs more coffee. Stat.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.771
No, they need it drinkable, so I got this.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.983
Uh, how's it going up there?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.445
Do you hear that thunder?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.863
Yeah, how could I not?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.616
Oh. Maybe because I didn't.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.119
What do you think it's about?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.246
Well, I don't know,

04:48.329 --> 04:50.415
but Saanvi's been on me
to come to the Bird Nest.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.625
Something about the black box.
Could that be it?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.585
-Yeah, it's worth checking out.
-Okay.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.963
Back in a bit.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.257
No! You rat!

04:59.340 --> 05:01.217
No. I'm a dragon.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.721
No, I've got it.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.435
Ben! Jared's here! Thank you.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.021
I knew my day off was toast
after his fourth phone call.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.147
Yeah.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.275
Finally. I've got a new lead on Eden.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.777
But NYPD won't meet with me
until next week.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.363
Ben, they closed the missing persons case.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.615
Well, they're wrong, and now I have proof.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.200
Eden drew these.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.580
And this is another passenger's house.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.623
Eden and Angelina stayed here
just days ago.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.917
Wait, what? Which passenger?

05:35.835 --> 05:36.753
Anna Ross.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.714
We have everything we need
for a new investigation.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.675
-The precinct's gonna push back on this.
-Jared.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.138
The day I buried Grace, I made a promise
that I'd bring our baby home.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.807
I've never been this close.
We have to move now.

05:51.142 --> 05:54.062
We gotta bypass the precinct.
Meet me at the Registry in an hour.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.022
The Registry?
No, they are not gonna help us.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.691
Eden's not even a passenger,
and her case is with missing persons.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.027
There's no law enforcement agency
that'd be more aggressive

06:01.110 --> 06:03.029
in tracking down a passenger
wanted for murder.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.949
And an ex-partner of yours has the juice
to put it right at the top of their pile.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.666
This is amazing.
I need to take a sample of this.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.045
Before you come at me with a scalpel,
you had news?

06:20.755 --> 06:23.466
Henry said that he brought
the black box back for you.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.926
You should be the first to hear it.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.677
You found something else?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.013
<i>I still own my truth. Slower.</i>

06:29.097 --> 06:31.432
-You can hear this? Vance couldn't.
-<i>Slower.</i>

06:31.516 --> 06:34.060
-Okay.
-<i>Go back. Save her.</i>

06:34.143 --> 06:36.270
-<i>Save him. Own my truth.</i>
-Uh, Saanvi.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.939
-<i>Last chance.</i>
-<i>Set them free.</i>

06:38.022 --> 06:40.233
-<i>It's all connected.</i>
-<i>It's all connected.</i>

06:41.859 --> 06:43.236
Are you okay?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.906
All right, I think it's safe
to say we're onto something.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.451
Okay, so how did the Callings
end up recorded on the black box?

06:51.035 --> 06:55.123
They're hidden in a 6.2-second segment
of ultra-low frequency waves, ULF.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.999
They were recorded
in the middle of the flight.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.794
Something about these six seconds
is clearly having an effect on you.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.256
So we just need to figure out
what happened that moment on the flight.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.259
Well, exactly, but the question is how.

07:13.057 --> 07:13.891
Hey.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.437
I'd give you a big, sloppy hug,
but I think someone's probably watching.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
-Probably.
-Where's your brother?

07:20.064 --> 07:24.235
Well, his car is filled with Eden posters
and garbage, so we drove separately.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.362
Jared said this lead's legit.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.867
Yeah. Yeah, I think it is,
that this could be it.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.620
Oh my gosh. Is that Dillon's Coffee?
Oh my gosh, I love that place.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.458
Weird. The only way I came across it was
'cause it was across from Jared's house.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.128
It's weird you'd go
so far out of your way for a coffee.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.922
-Damn.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.967
Zip it. If he finds out you've known
the whole time, he's gonna freak.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.302
Uh-huh.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.845
-Morning.
-Hey.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.514
-Mikami, you up to speed?
-Mm-hmm.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.516
All right. Now what?

07:56.225 --> 07:57.935
I'll take your report.
We file a complaint.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.062
Then we're clear to investigate.
When we get there,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.899
you're hauled in for questioning,
all right? We're not friends. Got it?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.276
All right, let's go.

08:27.381 --> 08:30.051
What? Amuta? The 828 copilot?

08:30.134 --> 08:31.219
What about him?

08:31.928 --> 08:32.762
He's the thunder.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.556
-I gotta talk to him.
-That's not why I'm here, Mick.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.643
We got Ben. You got the Lifeboat.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.603
Amuta'll be out in, like, five minutes.
You go.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.563
Okay. Take care of him.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.564
Yeah.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.857
Right this way.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.541
No one likes the Registry.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.045
But if we do what they ask
and we keep our appointments,

09:06.128 --> 09:07.547
then they leave us alone.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.590
And I can stay as long as I want?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.175
That's the whole point.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.052
We took this whole boarding house

09:13.135 --> 09:15.346
and made it a safe haven
for any passengers.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.771
Thank you. I've been so alone.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.065
There's so much good
to be done in this place.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.986
We garden, we harvest honey,
and we protect each other.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.325
Remember, if you have any Callings,
you have the power to ignore them.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.078
We have to be strong.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.247
Is there someone upstairs?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.420
I left the window open up there.
Probably a squirrel. I'll check.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.053
Good morning, little one.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.555
Hi.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.851
Eden, this is the nice man
who saved the doctor

10:01.934 --> 10:03.352
who then saved your life.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.730
Pulled him out of the water
when he was drowning.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.940
And now he's helping you again.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.942
Helping us.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.115
-I'm sorry about the door. I didn't--
-You need to be quiet.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.410
All day my people
are in and out right below.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.828
I know. I just thought we could--

10:20.911 --> 10:22.663
They can't know you're here.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.957
They won't understand,
and I won't ask them to.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.462
How about I wash that for you?

10:29.545 --> 10:31.380
Oh, that's okay. I just--

10:32.173 --> 10:33.174
All dirty.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.802
Remember, you're not here.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.977
Uh, Captain. Michaela Stone.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.688
Stone. Right, the detective.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.858
Not anymore,
but it looks like you're still flying.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.151
Private jets now.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.111
Boss brags he's got an 828 pilot

10:54.195 --> 10:57.198
and puts up with the fact
that I have to get rubber-stamped here

10:57.281 --> 10:58.949
every time I touch down in New York.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.912
Look, I know you saw what I saw.
The lightning. We're sharing a Calling.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.873
I'm due at Teterboro.
I have a plane to fly.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.250
This isn't something
that we can just turn our backs on.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.919
I'm sorry. I don't have time for this.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.045
Amuta, please!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.506
Amuta! Come on. No--

11:19.887 --> 11:22.348
And here's a list of the clothes
she had with her.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.433
Wait.
Anna Ross lives in Forest Hills, right?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.851
-Yeah.
-Check out this.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.396
A librarian out there
reported a stolen phone.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.398
The suspect is
a distressed woman with a toddler.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.234
Caucasian, early 20s, 5'1",
brown eyes, blonde hair.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.278
No, Anna said Angelina
still has long auburn hair.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.240
All right, suspect left bleach marks
and a hair bleach kit in the bathroom.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.366
Maybe it is her.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.785
Maybe she's on the run.
Makes sense she'd change her look.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.578
Library. Let's hit it.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.128
Look, I know it's an impossible ask,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.630
but we're gonna need you to hang back
so we can do our job.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.340
For real. We good?

11:56.924 --> 11:57.883
Yeah.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.020
Hey!

12:10.813 --> 12:11.856
Who are you?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.191
Do you know where my daughter is?

12:22.825 --> 12:23.993
828 freak.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.997
You truly have a way with words.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.916
We ought to do a prison Shakespeare
production. You'd make a great--

12:32.793 --> 12:33.836
Yeah!

12:37.423 --> 12:40.926
So I just had a passenger refuse
to follow a shared Calling with me.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.219
Sorry.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
Hey, do you know where Dad is?

12:44.263 --> 12:45.973
He's with Jared and Drea following a lead.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.560
A good one.
What are you guys on the hunt for?

12:49.643 --> 12:54.106
Saanvi found a section of the black box
that has recorded all of the Callings.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
-Up until the plane disappeared at Eureka.
-What?

12:56.275 --> 12:59.987
Yeah. Yours, mine, Ben's, Cal's,
a dozen more, all on top of each other,

13:00.070 --> 13:01.989
but it is only six seconds.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.492
Trying to figure out
what happened to 828 at that moment.

13:04.575 --> 13:05.910
We're focusing on the weather maps

13:05.993 --> 13:07.828
because we know
it was during the turbulence.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.622
When the lightning hit the plane.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.832
And all the thunder.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.253
The passenger who blew me off
was the copilot.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.048
-The Calling was thunder and lightning.
-We need to talk to him.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.551
Yeah, I tried, but he's about
to board a plane at Teterboro.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.345
Well, is there any way to stop him?

13:24.428 --> 13:25.763
That's actually why I'm here.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.641
NYPD. Your phone was stolen, ma'am?

13:29.141 --> 13:32.144
I thought it would be days
before I heard back, if ever.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.188
Do these folks look familiar to you?

13:34.271 --> 13:38.150
Well, that's the woman I saw.
And this looks like the little girl.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.488
Missing for two years? But her mother--

13:42.571 --> 13:43.614
That's not her mother.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.410
Her family is eager for any leads.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.496
I almost didn't report the stolen phone,

13:50.579 --> 13:53.290
but something about
the young woman's demeanor

13:53.374 --> 13:56.544
and the hair dye in the bathroom
concerned me.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.003
You were right to call.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.757
I see a lot of down-and-out folks,
but the child stood out.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.219
So sweet. In fact, she gave me a gift.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.766
She drew this while her mom--

14:11.475 --> 14:13.769
the woman used that computer.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.068
Browsing history has been wiped.

14:21.151 --> 14:25.030
Do you mind if we borrow the computer?
Have NYPD forensics dig a little deeper?

14:25.114 --> 14:28.367
-I'd have to get permission.
-We don't have time. Please.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.828
Have at it.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.040
I've got you an open port
through the APIS firewall.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.750
Okay. I need five minutes.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.793
And you got two.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.296
I need two minutes.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.553
Suspended pending in-person authorization.

14:47.636 --> 14:52.099
Captain Amuta,
report to FAA, special cases, located at…

14:52.892 --> 14:55.436
Alonzo, do you mind putting in
the address for the Bird's Nest?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.479
Wow, you're sending him here? Naughty.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.774
Capt. Clarke, you are
no longer cleared for takeoff.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.863
All clean for you, Eden.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.658
Mm, still warm. What do we say?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.076
Thank you.

15:15.372 --> 15:19.501
I've been thinking,
maybe we can call in an anonymous tip.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.379
You know, at least
let the Stones know she's alive.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.423
-Maybe even reunite them.
-Um…

15:27.343 --> 15:30.471
I'm the only family
this little girl knows.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.139
She and I are meant to be together.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.892
Because you took her?

15:36.602 --> 15:41.523
Eden and I are connected
in a way that transcends blood.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.361
I think we're even starting
to share the same Callings.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.865
I'm supposed to protect the people here,

15:49.949 --> 15:52.576
and harboring a fugitive
puts them in danger.

15:53.786 --> 15:58.374
I'll give you some food, cash,
but in the morning, you need to go.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.445
I am so close, Grace.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.197
I swear.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.379
Eden?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.635
It's you.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.147
-Let's play a little game.
-Okay.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.193
Come on. Come on, Eden. I'm here.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.195
Daddy's here.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.365
No.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.117
No, no, no, no, no!

17:15.200 --> 17:16.452
Eden!

17:17.661 --> 17:18.829
Eden!

17:19.997 --> 17:21.081
Eden!

17:26.003 --> 17:29.506
The Callings were all in our heads,
so how do they even get recorded?

17:29.590 --> 17:30.966
Uh, ULFs.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.135
Ultra-low frequencies.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.973
-This is gonna hurt, isn't it?
-Well, it's not gonna not hurt.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.602
What have you done?
This sure as hell isn't the FAA.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.146
Amuta, you know Dr. Bahl,
and this is Gabriel.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.525
How dare you meddle in my flight plans,
put my livelihood at risk?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.404
I'm trying to protect the passengers,
and as an 828 pilot,

17:52.488 --> 17:53.405
that is also your duty.

17:53.489 --> 17:57.034
Like hell. My duty ended
when I stepped off that plane.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.119
Well, the Callings
don't actually agree with that.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.872
We think your Callings are related
to the storm 828 flew through.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.333
There are only two people
who saw what was coming,

18:04.416 --> 18:07.336
who took us through to the other side.
You and Capt. Daly.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.799
I don't talk about Bill Daly.

18:12.299 --> 18:16.053
Clear my flight status,
or I'm calling the Registry to report you.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.055
We have the black box.

18:22.392 --> 18:27.523
If you can just take one moment to listen,
I promise I'll fix your flight.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.073
Okay, honey, this is the game.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.493
Mommy's gonna draw a picture,
and I want you to think really hard

18:39.576 --> 18:41.620
and try and draw the same picture.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.622
Okay.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.049
Okay, let me see.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.595
All right, that was a really good try.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.098
We're gonna try again. Okay?

19:04.810 --> 19:05.978
I'm hungry.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.565
Eden, come on. You've done this before,
so I know you can do it with me.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.526
We're connected.
I just need you to find it.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.737
Okay? Now think about
what Mommy's drawing and draw that.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.864
Can you do that?

19:39.303 --> 19:42.598
Why aren't you listening?
Just draw what Mommy draws.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.475
No.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.520
Come on, Eden. I'm here.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.522
Eden, Daddy's here.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.960
If you're not gonna do it right,
we're not going to draw.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.046
You can't just draw what you want.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.509
Everything okay here?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.845
Oh, I didn't know you were here.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.351
Thanks so much.

20:27.976 --> 20:31.813
Eden's a bit hungry and cranky.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.107
You know how kids can get.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.413
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like this. You?</i>

20:48.497 --> 20:51.375
<i>Never. Get over it. Up. Up.</i>

20:51.458 --> 20:53.085
Why am I listening to this?

20:53.168 --> 20:54.169
We're almost there.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.755
<i>No time. I'm going through it.</i>

20:57.339 --> 20:58.340
<i>You're what?</i>

20:58.840 --> 21:01.051
<i>Accelerating airspeed to 300 knots.</i>

21:01.593 --> 21:03.011
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

21:03.095 --> 21:04.513
Please turn it off!

21:08.392 --> 21:09.726
I could have stopped him.

21:11.144 --> 21:14.523
Right then, I knew we should have flown
over the storm, not through it,

21:14.606 --> 21:17.484
but I did nothing.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.403
I ruined nearly 200 lives.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.780
-There's no way that anyone--
-Stop.

21:21.863 --> 21:26.118
There's nothing you can say
that will make me not regret that moment.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.746
-Can I go?
-Can you just wait?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.541
We found something
buried under the recording,

21:32.624 --> 21:34.167
and we need you to hear it.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.421
<i>Slower.</i>

21:38.588 --> 21:39.464
<i>Slower.</i>

21:39.548 --> 21:41.800
<i>Go back. Save her.</i>

21:41.883 --> 21:44.219
<i>Save him. Last chance. Own my truth--</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:47.431
Every single Calling
is captured in the black box.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.598
But…

21:49.433 --> 21:50.309
but how?

21:50.892 --> 21:52.978
Flight 828, the gift that keeps on giving.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.356
Do you remember what happened
during those few seconds of the storm?

21:58.108 --> 22:00.027
I know exactly what happened.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.447
That was the moment we died.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.534
How do you know that?

22:09.369 --> 22:10.954
Amuta, what are you not telling us?

22:11.038 --> 22:15.083
The lightning was everywhere,
hitting us over and over.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.626
<i>And then, up ahead,</i>

22:16.710 --> 22:19.963
<i>all the lightning combined</i>
<i>into this massive ball of pure light,</i>

22:20.047 --> 22:21.256
<i>and we flew right into it.</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:23.675
<i>There's no way we could have survived.</i>

22:25.427 --> 22:26.762
That must have been terrifying.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.806
It was beautiful.

22:30.557 --> 22:34.853
I felt overwhelmed by a sense of peace.
A calm I'd never felt before.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.190
During the storm?
I mean, I was pretty terrified.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.608
Because you didn't see it.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.612
Only Daly and I did.
He was the only one who understood.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.656
And now he's gone.

22:47.949 --> 22:48.867
Maybe not.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.452
What do you mean?

22:50.952 --> 22:52.037
Two years ago.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.831
<i>Help me!</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:02.255
Where is he?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.591
We don't know exactly.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.986
After 828 landed,

23:25.779 --> 23:28.156
Daly became completely obsessed.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.991
With proving his innocence.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.120
No. It was more than that.
He wanted to go back.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.539
He wanted to feel
that sense of peace again.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.834
He hounded me to join,

23:38.917 --> 23:41.837
but the more unhinged he became,
the more I pulled away.

23:43.922 --> 23:48.051
I mean, I spent a lot of time
with Daly after 828. He was single-minded.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.845
He was incapacitated.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.222
Do you know what a copilot's job is?

23:52.305 --> 23:55.142
To take over
when the pilot is incapacitated.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.393
I didn't do that.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.438
Not on the plane
when I knew he was gonna kill us,

23:59.521 --> 24:02.524
and not afterwards when I could've
talked him out of his obsession.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.943
No one knew how far
he was gonna take that.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.236
I did.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.322
He called the morning
before he stole that plane.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.742
I didn't pick up because
I couldn't deal with him anymore.

24:14.703 --> 24:19.082
I should have been there for him.
I could have saved him. Saved that woman.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.003
I live with that every day.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.338
You know, I, um…

24:26.131 --> 24:28.049
I failed someone I loved once.

24:29.217 --> 24:34.431
It was my best friend. She lost her life,
and I will never forgive myself.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.349
You know what's awful?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.186
Even after what he did…

24:41.188 --> 24:42.022
I miss him.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.108
We'd been so close before everything.

24:47.277 --> 24:50.280
You can't imagine what it's like
to fly without your pilot.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.467
-Oh, thanks, Olive.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.676
Welcome.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.764
So, Dad, I've been looking
into myths about lost children--

25:15.847 --> 25:17.891
Please, Olive, I don't have time for this.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.479
Well, it actually may be helpful.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.147
You know, Eden was near a river--

25:24.231 --> 25:26.024
Jesus, Olive!

25:27.943 --> 25:29.694
-I'm Sorry. I was just trying to--
-What?

25:30.278 --> 25:33.782
Trying to show me pictures in a book?
Just take this all away from me.

25:35.742 --> 25:39.120
-Well, I'll help--
-No, just-- I need to be alone.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.104
Dad?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.069
Dad, what are you doing?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.863
I need to preserve the drawings
before they're gone again.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.323
Dad, please…

26:15.407 --> 26:17.909
I'm connecting to Eden.
Don't you see that?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.077
No.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.581
No, I don't. I don't see what's going…

26:27.544 --> 26:28.920
X marks the spot.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.882
Circle with a dot.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.386
Spiders crawling up your back.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.430
We were singing that this morning.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.852
Dad, I can feel her.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.607
I can feel her!

26:52.777 --> 26:56.615
Okay, so when Eden gets a Calling,
she… she draws them?

26:56.698 --> 26:57.782
Just like Cal did.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.288
Here's the windmill
she shared with me in a Calling.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.001
I'm not sure what this one is.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.670
Aunt Mick's cherry blossom Calling.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.632
Right. So this must be
the cloud of ash I saw.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.595
She must have been terrified.
I wish I could have been there with her.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.847
Wherever she is.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.644
What would you want her to draw?

27:27.979 --> 27:28.980
Seriously.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.526
Put it up there.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.172
-What are you giggling at, silly goose?

27:59.969 --> 28:02.889
No, it's-- Is he talking to you?

28:02.972 --> 28:06.726
Eden, you don't have a dad.
I told you that.

28:07.310 --> 28:11.147
Why are you connecting with that man?
You're connected to me!

28:16.319 --> 28:19.489
Erika! Hurry up!
This whole railing is gonna fall!

28:20.907 --> 28:23.618
You guys have made it
impossible for us to get a job.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.204
The world don't revolve around you.
You missed too many check-ins.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.915
-Can I just talk to someone?
-Yeah. How about your cellmate?

28:32.502 --> 28:35.004
Stop staring. They barely let you in here.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.173
Gotta be hard
working in a place like this,

28:37.257 --> 28:38.550
watching how they treat people.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.803
It's not my favorite,
but you've been undercover before.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.889
That was a band of wing nuts.
This is a whole different ball game.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.351
Yeah, it's the same kind of ball game that

28:49.310 --> 28:52.021
had my grandmother being forced
to sleep in a horse stall

28:52.105 --> 28:54.858
at the Santa Anita racetrack
during World War II.

28:55.859 --> 29:00.029
I'm just doing for 828ers what I wish
someone on the inside had done for her

29:00.613 --> 29:02.031
before it came to all that.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.491
Understood.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.623
What happened to you?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.962
I accidentally bumped into a fist.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.423
Happens a lot around here.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.841
I'm sorry.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.680
Guessing you're not here
for the cucumber water.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.515
What gives?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.601
I'm in a difficult situation.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.311
He says to the guy in prison.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.106
There's someone I'm helping,

29:35.190 --> 29:37.609
and I don't know
if I should be helping her.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.611
I thought you helped everyone.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.614
She must've done something pretty bad
for you to question.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.742
It's Angelina?

29:46.451 --> 29:49.996
Oh damn.
You're hiding manic pixie murder girl?

29:50.079 --> 29:53.124
I was roped in by a Calling,
and she has a child with her.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.334
Ben Stone's kid?

29:56.753 --> 30:01.132
I said they could stay for a night,
but Angelina, she's erratic.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.801
The little girl was drawing spiders,

30:02.884 --> 30:06.221
and Angelina flipped out,
crumpled the paper up. It was aggressive.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.807
I think I need to turn her in.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.266
Probably a good idea.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.398
Although… she may implicate you
in the murder.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.819
I didn't do anything.
She misinterpreted what I said.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.821
You might get a sympathetic jury.

30:22.904 --> 30:27.534
It's not like they're gonna seize
your compound and arrest everyone, right?

30:28.701 --> 30:29.744
I can't risk that.

30:32.956 --> 30:33.790
What do I do?

30:33.873 --> 30:35.291
You don't have a choice.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.962
You need to keep Angelina and the kid
at the compound hidden from everyone.

30:39.045 --> 30:39.879
No.

30:39.963 --> 30:43.424
You turn in Angelina, you put everyone
at the compound in danger.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.635
You make Angelina and Eden leave,

30:46.177 --> 30:48.888
you put that little girl in danger.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.431
Stay the course.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.101
-Until we can figure something out.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.435
Come on. Let's go.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.147
Thanks.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.401
We gotta stick together.

31:01.484 --> 31:04.612
There aren't enough of us
who know how evil the Callings really are.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.384
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.928
So, I'm trying to figure out

31:29.012 --> 31:31.723
why you didn't wanna tell anybody
what you saw or what you felt.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.976
Would you reveal that you had
an overwhelming sense of peace

31:35.059 --> 31:38.688
while flying 200 people
into what you believed was certain death?

31:38.771 --> 31:41.524
They would never let you step foot
in a cockpit again.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.027
But why not try talking to the passengers?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.487
I mean, we've all experienced things
no one else understands.

31:46.571 --> 31:50.533
But no one else saw what Daly and I saw.
We were the only ones.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.619
Actually, you weren't.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.705
-Gabriel, I think that we--
-It's okay. We can trust him.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.333
I'm Cal Stone.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.128
I was on 828, and I saw the same thing.

32:03.046 --> 32:07.258
I saw that light,
and everything just made sense.

32:08.676 --> 32:12.931
Huh, yes. That's exactly it.
It all just made sense.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.352
But it was in front of us.
How could you have seen it?

32:17.435 --> 32:19.938
I saw it out my window
a while before the turbulence hit,

32:20.021 --> 32:22.649
in the distance, this bright white glow.

32:22.732 --> 32:23.983
Not how storms work.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.779
They don't catch up to you
while you're going 500 miles an hour.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.114
Unless…

32:31.449 --> 32:33.451
-Unless it was chasing us.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.662
-Oh my God.
-You didn't fly into the storm.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.163
It flew into us.

32:37.914 --> 32:38.748
It chose us.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.876
Two years ago, I touched the tail fin
and disappeared again.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.713
I think I went back there,
back into that light we saw.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.257
I need to remember what happened. Please…

32:48.341 --> 32:50.301
I don't know how to help you.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.388
Well, you said
you and Daly talked about it.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.597
What did you discuss?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.600
The calm, the confusion
after the… the brightness.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.060
We had a phrase for it.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.063
A line from a poem about flying.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.524
We called it
the long, delirious, burning blue.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.109
The what?

33:08.027 --> 33:10.029
The long, delirious…

33:10.113 --> 33:11.656
…burning blue.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.450
Do you see it?

33:15.743 --> 33:17.370
Isn't it amazing?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.082
Why go back?

33:21.165 --> 33:22.917
-My mom.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.712
Something's happened to her. She's hurt.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.131
You can't save her. You know that.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.674
I need to go back for my family.

33:29.757 --> 33:34.178
But if you go, you'll forget everything
you see, everything you now know.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.263
Let him go.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.351
It's okay to go back, Cal.
You already have the answer.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.857
-Wait! You're supposed to be here.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.275
No, he's not.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.485
There's more to do.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.499
I know what happened
after I touched the tail fin.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.545
I was back on 828 again
with Daly and… and Fiona.

34:07.628 --> 34:08.838
Wait. Are you sure?

34:08.921 --> 34:11.549
Daly, he didn't want me to leave.
He grabbed me.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.719
Is that why he came back the same time
as you? He came back with you?

34:14.802 --> 34:16.763
Maybe. I don't think he meant to.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.015
-Are you sure that's where you were?
-I <i>know </i>it.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.683
It was all so familiar.

34:21.392 --> 34:22.977
Daly, he was worried.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.980
-Worried I'd forget something.
-What?

34:26.564 --> 34:27.565
I'm not sure.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.984
Fiona said I already had the answer.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.489
It made sense at the time,
but now I don't know. It…

34:34.572 --> 34:36.365
-We're gonna figure it out.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.875
Looks like my flight status
has been magically restored.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.960
I think that's the only thing today
that's not magic.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.879
You'll be cleared for takeoff
in a couple hours.

34:49.962 --> 34:50.963
Thank you.

34:52.548 --> 34:53.466
Hey.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.760
Let go of your guilt, Amuta.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.262
Capt. Daly and Fiona,
they're still out there.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.016
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm glad you grounded my plane.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.227
It's not personal, I swear.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.563
It's… it's for us.
It's for the passengers.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.649
Spoken like a true captain.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.568
Flight 828 is lucky
to have you at the helm.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.612
I don't know about that, but…

35:15.905 --> 35:16.906
I do.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.967
Just say it.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.011
Look, we checked every search
on the computer.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.263
Okay? It was all dead ends.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.101
-What about the cell phone towers?
-We tracked everything.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.270
Look, we'll keep looking, okay,
but for now…

35:47.937 --> 35:48.938
Thanks.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.124
We're gonna find her, Dad.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.377
I know.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.715
Mind putting this back up?

36:18.301 --> 36:19.343
Not there.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.182
It is a Calling.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.768
It belongs with the rest of them.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.813
It took me a while
to start having faith again.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.611
Callings just might
save your sister after all.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.331
Tickle, tickle.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.219
Aw, what do we say?

37:01.886 --> 37:02.720
Thank you.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.770
You can stay for now.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.564
You made the right decision.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.150
Eden's our guardian angel.

37:23.449 --> 37:26.911
This is our new home, baby girl.
Our forever home.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.803
I heard.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.846
How are you holding up?

37:47.306 --> 37:49.850
I had a Calling. It was awful.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.689
Everything was swallowed
by ash and destruction.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.818
And then this happened. It was…

38:00.987 --> 38:01.821
beautiful.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.199
Like she was right here.

38:08.744 --> 38:11.289
That's great. It means
you're getting closer and closer.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.625
Yeah, but why didn't the Calling
just lead me right to her?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.086
I mean, they've helped
so many other people.

38:18.754 --> 38:19.588
I don't know.

38:20.339 --> 38:23.426
See, this is why you were
so much better at leading the Lifeboat

38:23.509 --> 38:25.803
because if someone were to ask you that,

38:25.886 --> 38:29.640
you would have said something inspiring
or reassuring there, and I…

38:29.724 --> 38:31.892
I was a different person back then.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.147
No. No, you're the same person.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.860
You're just buried under a lot of grief.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.614
828 wasn't an accident.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.119
We're supposed to
save the passengers together.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.545
I'm having a hard time without my copilot.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.173
I made a promise to Grace.

39:03.507 --> 39:07.803
I swore to her that I would find Eden.
I can't give up on her. I can't.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.850
I wouldn't ask you to.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.355
But I know we're gonna find Eden.
I have no doubt.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.987
So I just hope that <i>when</i>
you fulfill your promise to Grace,

39:26.864 --> 39:28.199
I get my copilot back.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.309
Hey, Prof. Plain Vanilla.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.520
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

40:39.603 --> 40:40.438
Eagan.

40:40.521 --> 40:41.856
<i>I haven't missed you.</i>

40:41.939 --> 40:43.232
What the hell do you want?

40:43.315 --> 40:47.153
<i>It isn't about what I want.</i>
<i>This is about what you want.</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:50.072
-Ben Stone, I have great news.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.116
I know your little girl is alive.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.245
I know exactly where you can find her.
