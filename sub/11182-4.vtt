00:04.367 --> 00:07.200

* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.433 --> 00:26.000
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.067 --> 00:28.633
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.700 --> 00:31.233
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.300 --> 00:33.833

00:33.900 --> 00:36.433

00:41.567 --> 00:43.233

01:11.400 --> 01:13.000
How's it going, Alan?

01:13.067 --> 01:16.767
Oh, man... I didn't realize
that moving the help center

01:16.833 --> 01:18.533
would involve so much work.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.500
Yeah, there's
enough paper here to

01:20.567 --> 01:22.467
housebreak an elephant.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.100
(WHISTLING)

01:25.167 --> 01:27.033
-Hey, Weez...
-Oh, hi, George.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.267
-Hey, George.
-Don't call me George.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.133
-Why? Did you change
your name?
-(CHUCKLES)

01:33.200 --> 01:36.300
What I'd like to change
is your address.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.000
When are you gonna make up
with your father so you can
move back upstairs?

01:39.067 --> 01:41.467
Look, I love my father,

01:41.533 --> 01:44.567
but sometimes
it's hard to live with
someone you love.

01:44.633 --> 01:46.000
It sure is.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.033
-Look, if I'm in the way...
-George,

01:50.100 --> 01:52.467
let Alan work
things out his own way.

01:52.533 --> 01:55.533
Meanwhile, he can stay here
as long as he wants.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.333
Well, does he have to
stay here all day?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.067
Can't he at least go out
and get a job?

01:59.133 --> 02:01.200
Alan's been working
day and night.

02:01.267 --> 02:04.900
He's been organizing
the help center move
to the new building.

02:04.967 --> 02:08.233
Well, if he's so good
at moving, how come
he's still living here?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.400
George...

02:09.467 --> 02:10.767
Florence!

02:10.833 --> 02:12.767
You'll have to
yell louder than that,
she's out.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.900
Out? What about lunch?

02:14.967 --> 02:17.167
She made
some sandwiches
before she left.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.533
Sandwiches? How come
every time Florence
fixes something,

02:19.600 --> 02:23.500
she's gotta hide it between
two slices of bread?

02:23.567 --> 02:25.633
George, will you stop
complaining?

02:25.700 --> 02:27.867
The last time
we had a hot meal
was when that candle

02:27.933 --> 02:29.333
fell in the Jell-O.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.667
You're really in a
bad mood today.

02:33.733 --> 02:36.100
Of course I'm in a bad mood.
I'm worried about locking up

02:36.167 --> 02:38.900
-that Simpson account
this afternoon.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

02:38.967 --> 02:40.467
I'll get it.

02:40.533 --> 02:42.600
You sure
get up tight about money.

02:42.667 --> 02:45.167
So would you, if you had
to earn it.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.100
-Oh, Helen, come in.
-Hi, Mom.

02:51.167 --> 02:52.967
Oh, hi, Alan honey...

02:55.300 --> 02:58.100
-I'm afraid I've got
some bad news.
-What's that?

02:58.167 --> 03:01.767
We have to move out of
the old Help Center building
by the end of this week.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.700
Andrews has a
new tenant moving in.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.833
What? He told us we could
take our time.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.233
Well, now he's telling us
to take a walk.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.333
Did you tell him it'd take us
four weeks to get
a health permit?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.867
-Yeah.
-What did he say?

03:12.933 --> 03:14.333
He said "tough".

03:16.600 --> 03:18.233
Maybe we can get that
permit sooner.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.367
Oh, forget it.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.700
I already went to every
department in City Hall

03:21.767 --> 03:23.433
to try to
speed things up.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.700
Well, couldn't they
make an exception?

03:25.767 --> 03:27.733
At City Hall they don't
make exceptions,

03:27.800 --> 03:29.667
they just make coffee.

03:31.133 --> 03:34.167
-What?
-That's the way
bureaucracy works.

03:34.233 --> 03:36.233
Not if you know
the ropes,
it don't.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.100
You mean you can beat
the system?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.800
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.133
You say beat the system,
I say 'use' the system.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.333
-Use the system?
-That's right.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.933
How do you think
I got to be the
man I am today?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.333
Poor diet.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.900
George,

03:56.967 --> 03:59.633
are you saying
that you can get that
health permit sooner?

03:59.700 --> 04:04.300
Look, all I'm saying is
don't send a boy to
do a man's job.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.033
I suppose you
could do better.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.700
You're damn right I can.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.667
In fact, I'm going downtown
this afternoon to lock up
that Simpson account.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.233
And on my way back home,

04:12.300 --> 04:14.333
I will stop past City Hall
and pick up your permit.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.833
Do you really think you
can do that, George?

04:16.900 --> 04:18.267
No way.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.833
Of course I can.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.233
I'll just use my personality
and my know-how.

04:23.300 --> 04:26.100
Why don't you just stick
to your know-how?

04:27.933 --> 04:31.667
I'm telling you, George,
I even called the head man
down there,

04:31.733 --> 04:33.700
a dude named Mayflower.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.700
-And he said they
don't give permits...
-Hold it!

04:35.767 --> 04:37.433
Did you say Mayflower?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.533
Yeah. Why?

04:38.600 --> 04:39.633
What's his first name?

04:39.700 --> 04:40.967
Uh...

04:41.033 --> 04:42.067
Cornelius.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.200
Yeah, that's it.
Cornelius X. Mayflower.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.667
Cornelius X. Mayflower?

04:46.733 --> 04:48.367
This is gonna be
easier than I thought.

04:48.433 --> 04:50.100
Why? Do you know him?

04:50.167 --> 04:52.300
Uh, no. But...

04:52.367 --> 04:56.100
You figure a guy with
a funny name like that has
got to be a pushover.

04:56.167 --> 04:59.567
Look, Weezy, your troubles
are over. I'll get that
permit for you.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.033
-That will be great, George.
-Oh, good luck, George.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.167
Yeah, good luck, George.

05:04.233 --> 05:07.433
Can't you call me
Mr. Jefferson?

05:07.500 --> 05:11.200
You get us that health permit,
I'll call you anything
you want.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.300
Good. Call me from Alaska.
(LAUGHS)

05:35.000 --> 05:37.967
-Guess who.
I'll give you a clue.
-Say what?

05:38.033 --> 05:40.667
We were the worst two
cooks in the U.S. Navy.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.233
I burnt the meat,
you burnt the gravy.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.567
The name of our ship was
The Valley Forge.

05:45.633 --> 05:49.233
-They called you Corny.
They called me...
-George!

05:49.300 --> 05:50.467
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:52.800 --> 05:54.700
-George Jefferson!
-Yep!

05:57.933 --> 06:00.933
-Man, I don't believe it.
-Well, you better believe it,
'cause it's me.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.100
-How you doing?
-Well, how do I look?

06:05.167 --> 06:08.567
Well, I was hoping
you was doing
a little better than that.

06:08.633 --> 06:09.633
(LAUGHS)

06:11.133 --> 06:12.567
Hey, hey, dig it, all right?

06:12.633 --> 06:15.167
BOTH: The seventh fleet.
The seventh fleet.

06:15.233 --> 06:18.133
We're the ones
who can't be beat. Hey!

06:20.433 --> 06:21.967
You old scallywag.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.500
Whoa, you're
looking good, too!

06:24.567 --> 06:27.267
You must not be eating
your own cooking.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.867
Sit down!

06:28.933 --> 06:31.167
What you up to these days?

06:31.233 --> 06:33.533
Well, I own a chain
of cleaning stores.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.967
Jefferson Cleaners.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.700
-You own Jefferson Cleaners?
-That's right.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.233
-The Jefferson Cleaners?
-Yep.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.533
Never heard of them.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.967
(LAUGHS)

06:41.033 --> 06:43.333
I know.
I can tell by your suit.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.700
George, what brings you
down here?

06:50.767 --> 06:53.800
Well, I just locked up this
big deal down the street,

06:53.867 --> 06:55.133
-and I was just wondering...
-No, no, no.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.400
But how'd you know
where to find me?

06:57.467 --> 06:59.533
Oh, well, see, my wife
is trying to get a health
permit from your office.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.700
-Your wife?
-Yeah.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.300
You mean you found somebody
who'd marry you?

07:03.367 --> 07:04.800
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:04.867 --> 07:06.800
Look who's talking.

07:06.867 --> 07:09.933
In the Navy the only letters
you got was from
Dumb-Dumb Dora.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.467
-Whatever happened to that
loser anyway?
-I married her.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.900
Oh, yeah?

07:15.967 --> 07:17.967
Oh, yeah,
she had a great
sense of humor.

07:18.033 --> 07:20.100
Always pretending to be dumb.

07:22.767 --> 07:26.000
-How's she doing?
-I divorced her
10 years ago.

07:28.367 --> 07:30.733
Good. You're better off
without that dummy.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.133
Oh, look it here. You say your
wife needs a health permit?

07:36.200 --> 07:39.367
Yeah. Well, see,
the Help Center
she's working in

07:39.433 --> 07:41.367
is moving into a new building.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.500
-So, I was just wondering
if you could...
-If I could

07:43.567 --> 07:45.667
cut through all
the red tape, huh?

07:45.733 --> 07:47.800
-Well, yeah.
-That ain't no problem.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.233
Take care of it for
you right now.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.833
Hey, thank you, Corny.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.267
Man, Corny, seeing
you after all these years

07:54.333 --> 07:56.400
sure brings back
a lot of memories.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.600
Help Center, yeah, here we
are.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.400
George,

08:02.467 --> 08:05.133
you remember the crazy things
we used to do
on that ship?

08:05.200 --> 08:08.100
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, you mean like the time
we put those two gallons

08:08.167 --> 08:10.567
of bourbon into
the pancake syrup?

08:12.733 --> 08:14.567
Half the ship got drunk.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.900
And then the Lieutenant got
wise and asked us,
"What we did?"

08:18.967 --> 08:21.633
And you said, "Nothing, sir.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.733
"Uh, the men
must be seasick."

08:25.200 --> 08:27.033
Which was a dumb
thing to say.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.967
What was so dumb about it?

08:29.033 --> 08:31.567
Well, how are the men
gonna be seasick when
we was in dry dock?

08:36.900 --> 08:40.133
Lord heavens... Remember that
Petty Officer Larkin?

08:40.200 --> 08:45.333
Yeah, that honky. He used to
make us scrub down the deck
with our toothbrushes.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.600
I got him good.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.333
-Did you get him, George?
-Yeah...

08:54.067 --> 08:57.267
Yeah, he was going on
R&R to visit his wife in
Tokyo, you know?

08:57.333 --> 08:59.000
So I had some flowers sent to
his room

08:59.067 --> 09:00.433
and on the card I put,

09:00.500 --> 09:04.133
"Dear Steven,
you are the greatest.
Love, Doreen."

09:04.200 --> 09:06.933
-Well, that ain't so bad.
-His wife's name was Nancy.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Look out!

09:15.200 --> 09:17.667
-Boy. Oh, boy...
-Here's your wife's permit,
George.

09:17.733 --> 09:20.167
Thanks, buddy. Boy, I knew
I could count on you.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.267
You know,

09:22.333 --> 09:25.700
I almost forgot about
all your practical jokes.

09:25.767 --> 09:29.500
I bet you must have got
everybody on that ship.
Except me.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.067
Oh, yeah? I tried to get you
once.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.667
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:32.733 --> 09:35.933
The day I shipped out,
I hid a wig and a dress in
your locker.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.500
-In there?
-Uh-huh.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.567
I figured you'd get
a big kick out of them
once you found them.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.300
I didn't find them.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.500
-You didn't find them?
-No. The Captain did.

09:46.567 --> 09:47.567
The Captain!

09:49.900 --> 09:53.967
Yeah, he pulled a surprise
inspection the day after you
shipped out.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.833
The Captain found them? Man,
that's the funniest thing
I ever heard in my life.

09:56.900 --> 10:02.867
Oh, it was real funny, all
right. Everybody on the ship
was calling me,

10:02.933 --> 10:04.833
"Mayflower, the gay flower."

10:10.433 --> 10:11.567
Lord...

10:11.633 --> 10:15.167
One sucker even
sent me a corsage.

10:15.233 --> 10:19.033
(LAUGHS) Man, that's
great. I wish I could have
been there.

10:19.100 --> 10:23.333
Yeah, me, too. You could
have helped me explain
to the ship's psychiatrist.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.433
-Psychiatrist!
-Yes. He thought I liked to
wear women's clothes.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.267
What a drag.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.867
I mean, a shame.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.800
I even lost a promotion
because of it.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.033
Oh, no!

10:41.567 --> 10:43.300
And it ain't funny, Jefferson!

10:43.367 --> 10:45.867
-Hey, Corny man...
-Don't "Hey, Corny" me, man!

10:45.933 --> 10:48.933
-Man, it was just a joke.
-It was a bad joke!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.733
You sawed off runt!

10:53.467 --> 10:54.833
Who you calling
a sawed off runt?

10:54.900 --> 10:57.900
Well, ain't nobody here but
you, sucker.

10:57.967 --> 11:00.700
-I ain't got to
take that from you.
-That's right.

11:00.767 --> 11:03.567
You ain't got to
take nothing from me.

11:03.633 --> 11:07.033
Including the permit.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.833
Big deal! You're the last
person on earth I'd take
a favor from.

11:09.900 --> 11:13.600
Solid! Because
I'm the last person you'd
ever get one from!

11:13.667 --> 11:16.533
Look, I ain't got to come
to you for that permit,
I'll go over your head.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.867
Sucker, you couldn't get
over my head if you was
standing on a ladder.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.733
Oh, no? You ain't nothin'
but a two bit pencil pusher.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.300
Pencil pusher!

11:25.900 --> 11:27.400
That does it.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.967
Now what you say to that?

11:33.033 --> 11:34.533
I say, who cares?

11:34.600 --> 11:37.667
Well, I hope your wife feels
the same way, George.

11:37.733 --> 11:40.300
'Cause it'll be a safe night
in Central Park

11:40.367 --> 11:42.800
before she ever
gets a permit
from this office.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.500
Now, get out!

12:00.533 --> 12:01.533
Hey, Weez.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.033
Oh, there you are.

12:06.533 --> 12:08.100
Well?

12:08.167 --> 12:11.167
Huh? Oh, yeah, Weezy,
your kisses are just
as dynamite as ever.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.033
Did you get it?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.033
Did I get it? Did somebody
tell a joke or something?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.900
The permit.
Did you get the permit?

12:18.967 --> 12:20.000
Oh, that.

12:20.067 --> 12:22.500
Don't tell me the big wheel
never got rolling.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.400
What went wrong?

12:24.467 --> 12:27.900
Nothing went wrong.
Just a lot of pieces have
to be put together.

12:32.133 --> 12:34.900
-Did you talk to
Mr. Mayflower?
-Yes, I did.

12:34.967 --> 12:37.767
But we still have
to wait four weeks, right?

12:37.833 --> 12:39.567
No, you don't have to wait
four weeks.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.733
Oh, George, you got it!

12:41.800 --> 12:44.633
Oh, thank you! Oh...

12:44.700 --> 12:48.600
-That's terrific.
-Oh, come on, Alan, we've got
lots to do.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.667
Uh, Weezy, wait a minute.
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

12:50.733 --> 12:53.633
-Is something wrong?
-No.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.000
George, I know when
something's bothering you.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.800
Okay, Weezy.

12:59.867 --> 13:03.333
How would you feel
if a deal that you really
depended on fell through?

13:03.400 --> 13:06.167
-You don't mean you...
-It wasn't my fault!

13:06.233 --> 13:09.800
Oh, no, you didn't get
the Simpson account.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.400
Huh?

13:11.467 --> 13:14.267
That new account meant
so much to you.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.767
-But, Weezy...
-I know how you must feel.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.733
If we didn't get
that permit, I don't know
what I'd do.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.800
You don't?

13:24.133 --> 13:26.267
By the way,
where's the permit?

13:26.333 --> 13:27.867
Uh...

13:27.933 --> 13:30.100
Oh, yeah, I left it
downstairs in the store.

13:30.167 --> 13:33.200
-Oh. I'll go down and get it.
-No, I'll go get it!

13:35.333 --> 13:38.900
Oh, George, you're wonderful.

13:38.967 --> 13:41.500
And Alan didn't think
you could do it.

13:41.567 --> 13:44.733
-Yeah, I guess I was wrong.
-Yeah.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.067
And don't take it so hard
about that Simpson account.

13:48.133 --> 13:50.267
At least you came through with
the permit.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.967
That's right. Just think
there are hundreds
of people out there

13:54.033 --> 13:57.133
-depending on
the Help Center.
-Hundreds?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.533
Thousands.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.367
And they can look
you in the face and say,

14:03.433 --> 14:05.467
"He's the guy who did it."

14:21.567 --> 14:24.400
Hey, Mr. Jefferson, how's
it going?

14:24.467 --> 14:25.733
Give me a double.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.967
-Trouble at work?
-No, trouble at home.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.467
Uh-oh. I better make
that a triple, huh?

14:31.867 --> 14:33.467
Hello, Mr. J.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.167
Care for some company?

14:36.233 --> 14:37.767
-No.
-Thank you.

14:40.033 --> 14:43.233
-Imbibing?
-No, just drinking.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.033
You seem a bit troubled. Would
you like to unburden yourself?

14:46.100 --> 14:47.833
Yeah. Bye, Bentley!

14:49.300 --> 14:51.333
Ah, wait a minute,
Mr. Jefferson.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.600
He's right. You know,
sometimes it kind of helps to
get things off your chest.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.033
Yeah, but it ain't
no big thing.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.467
Well, then it won't take long,
will it?

14:58.533 --> 15:01.933
Well, what would you do
if you had to tell
somebody something

15:02.000 --> 15:04.400
and you knew what
you had to tell them
was gonna make them mad.

15:04.467 --> 15:07.700
Oh, you mean
that you're the harbinger
of ill tidings.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.567
No! I just gotta tell Weezy
some bad news.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.867
Well,

15:13.933 --> 15:15.200
you know what they say.

15:15.267 --> 15:17.533
Yes. Honesty is
the best policy.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.967
No, no, no, no, no.
What you don't know
won't hurt you.

15:22.033 --> 15:25.000
Mr. J, you should face the
music and be done with it.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.800
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-But...

15:26.867 --> 15:30.500
Discretion is
the better part of valor.

15:30.567 --> 15:32.833
But when the going gets
tough, the tough get going.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.300
Yeah.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.900
Fools rush in where
wise men fear to tread.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.767
-Well, there's
no safety in hiding.
-Right.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.833
Better safe than sorry.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.633
Au contraire.
The truth will out.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.567
And the truth hurts.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.800
-He who hesitates is lost.
-Look before you leap.

15:55.033 --> 15:56.967
Lies beget lies.

15:57.033 --> 16:00.567
If you keep your mouth shut,
you'll never put
your foot in it.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.600
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
BOTH: Huh?

16:09.900 --> 16:11.300
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

16:11.367 --> 16:13.033
It's an old Russian proverb.
It means that...

16:13.100 --> 16:17.133
So who cares what it means! I
got an old black proverb.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.767
When you hear two
turkeys talking,
it's time to be walking. Bye.

16:24.467 --> 16:27.100
Uh-huh. Thank you very much.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.600
I just talked to the movers.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.933
Tomorrow we'll be
in our new building.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.767
Oh, Alan,
you're a born organizer.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.833
We never could have
made this move without you.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.933
Thanks. But it was George,
I mean, Mr. Jefferson,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.667
-who got us the permit.
Let's not forget that.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

16:44.733 --> 16:48.567
Well, don't worry.
If I know George,
he won't let us forget it.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.900
-Yes?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

16:50.967 --> 16:53.167
I thought this was
the Jefferson apartment.

16:53.233 --> 16:57.033
-Oh, it is. I'm Alan Willis.
-Cornelius Mayflower.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.867
Oh, Mr. Mayflower!
I'm Louise Jefferson.

16:59.933 --> 17:02.167
-Won't you come in?
-Well, thank you.

17:02.233 --> 17:04.000
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:04.067 --> 17:07.300
-Is your husband here?
-No. But he should
be home soon.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.833
Uh-huh... I suppose...

17:11.133 --> 17:13.200
I suppose he told
you about the permit.

17:13.267 --> 17:15.133
Yes. And I...

17:15.200 --> 17:19.633
Well, before you say anything,
I just wanna tell you that
I've done some thinking.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.933
And, well,
I've changed my mind
about giving you the permit.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.167
BOTH: What?

17:24.233 --> 17:27.200
-But, Mr. Mayflower...
-What I did today was wrong.
I misused my authority.

17:27.267 --> 17:29.433
-But, but...
-You're in charge. You can...

17:29.500 --> 17:32.833
Listen, a man in my position
can't afford to have his
personal likes and dislikes

17:32.900 --> 17:34.933
influence his decision.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.933
-Oh, but, Mr. Mayflower...
-So I've decided to give you
the permit.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.067
Well, couldn't you bend
the rules just this once?
Our Help Center...

17:45.067 --> 17:46.067
Huh?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.967
Here's your permit.
And good luck.

17:49.033 --> 17:51.600
But I thought you already gave
the permit to George.

17:51.667 --> 17:56.767
I did. But then we started
arguing about our old Navy
days and...

17:56.833 --> 17:58.567
Well, I tore it up.

17:58.633 --> 18:00.933
Your old Navy days?

18:04.100 --> 18:06.233
Then George didn't
get the permit?

18:06.300 --> 18:08.067
I'm afraid he didn't.

18:08.133 --> 18:10.600
In fact, the whole thing
has given me one headache.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.800
Uh... Can I have
some water, please?

18:13.867 --> 18:15.800
Oh, sure, right this way.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.867
I'm really sorry,
Mrs. Jefferson.

18:17.933 --> 18:20.133
I guess I let old George
get the best of me.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.367
Well, when he gets home,
he's gonna get
the worst of me.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.000
Oh, man, Mrs. Jefferson,
I can't believe

18:28.067 --> 18:30.333
George would try to pull
something like that.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.967
That's because you've only
lived here a week.

18:35.767 --> 18:38.733
-Hey, Weez...
-Oh, there you are.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.733
Look, Weezy,

18:42.800 --> 18:46.000
I know you thought
I was upset because I didn't
get the Simpson account.

18:46.067 --> 18:49.333
-Yes...
-Well, I wasn't telling the
truth.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.900
Oh? Then what is the truth?

18:52.967 --> 18:57.300
Well, the truth is I did get
the Simpson account!
(LAUGHS)

18:59.967 --> 19:03.000
George, is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

19:03.067 --> 19:07.200
Anything else? Oh, yeah, I
might be getting the Peabody
Restaurant account, too.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.267
-Do you have the permit?
-The permit?

19:12.700 --> 19:16.233
Well, uh... Look,
Weezy, about the permit...

19:16.300 --> 19:19.367
-We know
all about it, George.
-You do?

19:19.433 --> 19:21.667
Yes, Mr. Mayflower told
us...

19:21.733 --> 19:24.500
Mayflower told you! Well,
that no good jive turkey!

19:24.567 --> 19:26.800
-George...
-I bet he said it was all my
fault!

19:26.867 --> 19:29.433
-Oh, well...
-That fat headed
pencil pusher!

19:31.167 --> 19:34.033
-Now I know why I waited
27 years to see him again!
-George...

19:34.100 --> 19:37.100
Can you imagine him getting
mad just because I hid a wig
and a dress in his locker!

19:37.167 --> 19:39.567
-George...
-Knowing that turkey, he
probably got mad 'cause the

19:39.633 --> 19:41.067
dress didn't fit!

19:45.400 --> 19:47.567
That dude
always has been strange!

19:47.633 --> 19:49.000
Mr. Jefferson...

19:49.067 --> 19:51.167
You stay out of this! And if I
ever see Mayflower again...

19:53.733 --> 19:57.067
Mayflower! What the hell are
you doing here?

19:57.133 --> 19:59.633
I came over to straighten
things out,

19:59.700 --> 20:02.133
but I see I was
just wasting my time.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.933
-Mr. Mayflower...
-Last time I do a favor
for a fool.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.567
A fool! You ain't done no
favor for me, chump!

20:09.633 --> 20:12.867
I brought your wife her
permit. Now you owe me one,
Jefferson.

20:13.733 --> 20:16.000
I don't owe you nothing.

20:16.067 --> 20:19.333
-Oh, George!
-Forget it, Weezy. We don't
need nothing from him.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.467
-Jefferson,
you are a jackass!
-Jackass?

20:21.533 --> 20:22.967
Look, you know I done
hit dudes for less than that.

20:23.033 --> 20:25.167
-Where? In the kneecap?
-What? That's it...

20:26.533 --> 20:28.533
Let's go...

20:28.600 --> 20:29.767
(BOTH YELLING)

20:32.333 --> 20:35.267
Fun for me? Look, I can beat
you with one hand tied behind
my back, chump.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.067
I'm gonna knock so many teeth
loose,

20:37.133 --> 20:38.833
you're gonna think
there's a crap game going
on in your head!

20:38.900 --> 20:41.967
Oh, yeah?
Just like you did them
Marines in Hong Kong!

20:42.033 --> 20:44.067
I had to drag
you out of there before they
killed you!

20:44.133 --> 20:48.200
Sucker, how you gonna drag me
out of anywhere! You was
hiding under the table!

20:48.267 --> 20:52.500
Me! Hiding! Look, ain't
a Marine been born could
scare George Jefferson!

20:54.200 --> 20:56.567
Wait a minute!

20:56.633 --> 20:59.333
Now you talking
about U.S. Marines?

20:59.400 --> 21:00.900
You're damn right we are!

21:00.967 --> 21:03.633
Well, why were you fighting
with them?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.233
Where did he come from?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.967
Sailors always fight Marines.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.233
-It's tradition.
-That's right.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.233
Well, that sounds like
a pretty dumb tradition,
huh, Mrs. Jefferson?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.533
What do you know?
You ain't ever even
been in the service.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.433
Well, if I had been in the
service,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.333
I would have done things
a lot different
than you two.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.867
That's because you are
different.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.467
You don't know what
it is like to be in the
service and be black.

21:34.533 --> 21:38.167
He don't know what's
it like being nowhere
and being black.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.133
-Mr. Mayflower,
Alan is black.
-Say what?

21:45.133 --> 21:48.867
Well, his mother's
a sister, but his father
ain't no brother.

21:50.133 --> 21:52.100
One of them zebras!

21:57.567 --> 21:59.433
Aw, it couldn't
have been that bad

21:59.500 --> 22:03.267
being black and in
the service, could it,
Mrs. Jefferson?

22:03.333 --> 22:06.433
Oh, no. I think they're
exaggerating.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.633
I don't believe
any of George's Navy
stories anyway.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.033
Are you crazy, Weezy?
You should have heard
some of the

22:12.100 --> 22:14.033
things those honky officers
used to say to us.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.833
Oh, like the one
about tracing
your family tree

22:16.900 --> 22:19.067
back to when
your ancestors were
swinging in it.

22:19.133 --> 22:21.767
-Say, cool it...
-Don't mind him.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.567
He thinks plaid is beautiful.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.533
Remember that time
that honky said he wanted
to meet your sister?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.533
-Yeah.
-And I let him meet
my fist instead.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.700
-You put it on him.
-Well, you was
my buddy, right?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.133
What you mean "was"?

22:33.200 --> 22:34.267
Well, we're still buddies,
ain't we?

22:34.333 --> 22:36.600
-Gonna drink on it.
-All right.

22:36.667 --> 22:40.033
BOTH: The seventh fleet,
the seventh fleet. We're the
ones that can't be beat.

22:42.033 --> 22:44.333
All right.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.067
Uh, Mr. Mayflower,
about that permit...

22:47.133 --> 22:51.600
Don't worry about a thing,
Mrs. Jefferson.
Have it for you tomorrow.

22:51.667 --> 22:55.900
-It was great the way you
handled that, Alan.
-Yeah, but we were lucky.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.900
Mr. Jefferson
has one good quality.

22:58.967 --> 23:02.633
-Black pride.
-Right on.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.767
Say, George, do you remember
that weekend you
and me spent in Singapore.

23:06.833 --> 23:10.733
Uh-huh. And we got so drunk,
them two girls had to help
us back to the hotel.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.267
You never told me
about that, George.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.433
He didn't?

23:24.400 --> 23:25.767
We had a ball.

23:27.767 --> 23:30.000
Dig yourself, Corny.

23:30.067 --> 23:32.700
A whole weekend
in Singapore, huh?

23:32.767 --> 23:36.600
Saturday, Sunday and Monday
continued.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.667
Hey, Corny...

23:40.133 --> 23:43.067
-Two girls took you home, huh?
-All the way.

23:45.267 --> 23:48.333
-All the way?
-Yeah, uh, look.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.000
They were two nurses.
Me and Corny weren't
feeling too good, right?

23:51.067 --> 23:52.867
We was feeling great!

23:53.900 --> 23:55.000
Dig yourself!

23:55.633 --> 23:57.500
Great, huh?

23:57.567 --> 23:58.533
Hey, Weezy, I thought
you didn't believe
my Navy stories.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.667
I don't believe it...

24:35.500 --> 24:39.733
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.533
* Movin', movin on up
