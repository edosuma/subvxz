00:18.644 --> 00:20.311
(laughs)

00:20.317 --> 00:22.351
Thank you for coming.

00:22.436 --> 00:23.603
You don't have
to thank me.

00:23.670 --> 00:24.971
MAN: Mr. Calder,
how was the event?

00:25.022 --> 00:27.473
Well, let's just say
there's very little "fun"

00:27.524 --> 00:28.891
in "fund-raiser."

00:28.976 --> 00:31.844
That's because it's about
raising funds, not having fun.

00:31.895 --> 00:33.229
Yeah, no kidding.

00:33.297 --> 00:34.363
If I'm dropping
several thousand,

00:34.431 --> 00:36.232
I expect a few giggles.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.868
Would have had more fun losing
that money in Las Vegas.

00:38.936 --> 00:39.969
Am I right, Nicky?

00:40.037 --> 00:41.871
I don't know anything
about that, sir.

00:41.955 --> 00:43.022
Oh...

00:43.073 --> 00:45.241
But isn't this more rewarding
than gambling?

00:45.325 --> 00:47.877
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get
in the car, Princess Buzzkill.

00:47.961 --> 00:49.962
(tires screeching)

00:51.498 --> 00:53.633
Whoa, whoa,
run, run!

CALDER:
Nicky!

00:56.036 --> 00:57.303
(woman screams)
MAN: Get in the van now!

00:57.370 --> 00:58.137
CALDER:
Don't shoot me.

00:58.204 --> 01:00.556
Fine.

01:00.641 --> 01:03.142
Okay, I'm going.

CALLEN:
You reading anything

02:40.674 --> 02:42.424
in those tea leaves?
Yeah,

02:42.509 --> 02:44.343
somebody needs
to wash her cup out.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.878
Be my guest,

02:45.929 --> 02:48.430
but you're taking your life in
your own hands if you drop it,

02:48.515 --> 02:50.599
that being Hetty's
favorite cup.

02:52.686 --> 02:54.603
You hear anything?

02:54.671 --> 02:57.523
She's still recuperating,

02:57.590 --> 02:59.475
like she was last month
and the month before that.

02:59.559 --> 03:00.926
Think something else
is going on?

03:01.778 --> 03:02.728
Of course, it's Hetty--

03:02.779 --> 03:03.896
something else
is always going on.

03:03.947 --> 03:05.197
Yeah, and here comes
the one person

03:05.265 --> 03:07.066
who probably
knows what it is.

03:07.117 --> 03:10.602
What's the latest
on Hetty?

03:10.654 --> 03:12.421
I've been trying to contact you.

03:12.489 --> 03:14.190
She's very disappointed

03:14.257 --> 03:16.158
with the repairs on the Jaguar.
What's that got

03:16.243 --> 03:17.409
to do with
us, Nell?

03:18.712 --> 03:20.629
Mm-hmm,

03:20.714 --> 03:24.466
and she told me to remind
you about the Philippines.

03:24.551 --> 03:25.668
Actually,
it'd be best

03:25.752 --> 03:27.553
if you could have
someone pick it up today.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.722
Wonderful.

03:29.789 --> 03:31.173
She'll be so glad to hear that.

03:31.258 --> 03:32.341
Hi.

03:32.425 --> 03:34.727
You both owe me a DTS
from your last trip.

03:34.794 --> 03:36.812
What's the word on Hetty, Nell?

03:36.897 --> 03:41.483
Hetty is at home recuperating
and expecting to return shortly.

03:41.568 --> 03:42.484
Yeah, okay,

03:42.569 --> 03:43.986
you said the same thing
last week.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.321
And the week before that.

03:45.405 --> 03:48.357
Look, I can only tell you
what I've been told.

03:48.441 --> 03:50.943
Trust me, no one wants her
back here more than me.

03:50.994 --> 03:52.077
I've got three months

03:52.145 --> 03:53.946
of personnel status records
to release,

03:53.997 --> 03:58.317
a roomful of PIIs that need to
be declassified and destroyed,

03:58.368 --> 04:00.085
not to mention
the quarterly training reviews

04:00.153 --> 04:02.087
that are about
to become semiannual

04:02.155 --> 04:04.790
if I don't finish them.

04:04.841 --> 04:06.792
(whispering): And just because
you don't see her

04:06.843 --> 04:07.876
doesn't mean

04:07.961 --> 04:10.829
she's not here.

04:18.971 --> 04:21.190
Well, looks
like your inbox is about

04:21.274 --> 04:23.642
to reach critical mass,
Detective.

04:23.693 --> 04:25.144
DEEKS:
I'm on top of it.

04:25.195 --> 04:26.278
NELL:
Really?

04:26.346 --> 04:28.280
Because somewhere
in this compost pile

04:28.348 --> 04:31.183
are several unfiled
NAVCOMPT 2282 forms,

04:31.234 --> 04:34.453
along with your
last two time cards,

04:34.520 --> 04:35.904
so if you'd like
to get paid

04:35.989 --> 04:39.491
sometime in the near future,
I suggest you start digging.

04:43.213 --> 04:44.296
DEEKS:
Is it me,

04:44.364 --> 04:46.365
or is Nell beginning to sound

04:46.416 --> 04:48.634
more and more
like you-know-who?

04:48.701 --> 04:50.469
Have we heard anything new
on Hetty's condition?

04:50.536 --> 04:52.037
SAM:
According to Nell,

04:52.088 --> 04:53.839
Hetty's still keeping
an eye on things.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.641
Big Brother is watching.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.643
Or in Hetty's case,

04:57.710 --> 04:59.044
Little Mother.

05:00.697 --> 05:02.481
What?

05:02.548 --> 05:03.816
Okay, you guys have been
doing this too long.

05:03.883 --> 05:06.068
You're getting paranoid.

05:06.152 --> 05:08.404
HETTY (over speaker):
A healthy dose of paranoia can

05:08.488 --> 05:10.272
keep you alive in this business,
Detective.

05:10.357 --> 05:11.407
Oh!

05:13.827 --> 05:15.828
Did you see that?

05:15.895 --> 05:17.863
I saw you slam
Hetty's face shut.

05:17.914 --> 05:19.581
ERIC:
Detective and Agents,

05:19.649 --> 05:21.283
can I have your attention?

05:21.368 --> 05:23.669
Acting Operations
Manager Hunter

05:23.737 --> 05:25.037
requests
your presence

05:25.088 --> 05:27.506
in the operations center ASAP.

05:27.573 --> 05:28.957
Thank you.

05:30.126 --> 05:31.210
What the hell was that?

05:31.261 --> 05:34.963
That was Hunter forbidding Eric
from whistling.

05:36.683 --> 05:38.867
HUNTER: There was a kidnapping last
night in Beverly Hills.

05:38.935 --> 05:40.135
The man you are seeing
is Dennis Calder.

05:40.203 --> 05:41.987
SAM:
Guy dropped out

05:42.055 --> 05:44.056
of MIT to start
his own software company,

05:44.107 --> 05:46.692
which he sold for millions
while still in his 20s.

05:46.759 --> 05:49.311
He lately... He's been
developing intelligence

05:49.396 --> 05:50.696
and information systems

05:50.763 --> 05:53.098
for the private sector,
right?

05:53.166 --> 05:54.783
- Correct.
CALLEN: So what's this got

05:54.868 --> 05:56.368
to do with us?

05:56.436 --> 05:57.820
Perhaps if you would allow me

06:02.125 --> 06:03.442
A recent cyber-attack

06:03.493 --> 06:05.627
on the Defense Department's
computer server

06:05.712 --> 06:07.546
had all the earmarks
of one of Calder's

06:07.613 --> 06:09.181
prototype
software programs.

06:09.249 --> 06:11.333
He denied any knowledge
of the attack,

06:11.401 --> 06:13.836
which forced the
National Security Agency

06:13.920 --> 06:15.337
to put him under
surveillance.

06:15.405 --> 06:18.023
The NSA was about to bring
him in for questioning

06:18.091 --> 06:18.991
when he was
grabbed.

06:19.059 --> 06:20.993
(Deeks clears throat)
Yes.

06:21.061 --> 06:22.978
Just, uh,
who's the woman?

06:23.063 --> 06:26.498
She has disappeared and
has yet to be identified.

06:26.566 --> 06:28.817
Fund-raiser guest list
has her listed simply

06:28.902 --> 06:30.352
as Calder's plus one.

06:30.437 --> 06:32.821
What we do know for
sure is that she is not

06:32.906 --> 06:33.856
his wife.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.157
Eric.

06:35.241 --> 06:37.826
(clears throat) Calder is married
to Heather Marcum.

06:37.911 --> 06:39.912
They have one son-- Shawn.

06:39.979 --> 06:42.030
The driver who was shot is
Nicholas Delamico.

06:42.115 --> 06:43.499
Delamico was still in surgery
this morning,

06:43.583 --> 06:46.085
but he should be out by now,

06:46.152 --> 06:47.953
and the van that was
used was reported stolen

06:48.004 --> 06:50.038
six hours prior
to the shooting

06:50.123 --> 06:51.290
and has yet to
be recovered.

06:51.341 --> 06:52.374
HUNTER: The LAPD is
taking a backseat

06:52.459 --> 06:54.042
in this, and we
have been tasked

06:54.127 --> 06:58.013
with helping the NSA find
Calder and his abductors

06:58.098 --> 07:00.516
and to discover who was
behind the cyber-attack

07:00.600 --> 07:02.601
before another
can be launched.

07:02.668 --> 07:04.303
NSA can't handle finding
this guy on their own?

07:04.354 --> 07:06.054
We've all got enough
on our plates as it is.

07:06.139 --> 07:07.055
As much as
I would like

07:07.140 --> 07:08.607
to discuss the merits

07:08.674 --> 07:10.442
of NCIS involvement with this,

07:10.510 --> 07:12.027
I too have a lot

07:12.112 --> 07:13.445
on my plate.

07:13.513 --> 07:16.448
I would like a situation
report by 1100 hours.

07:29.695 --> 07:32.464
Something el you
need, Agent Callen?

07:32.532 --> 07:34.967
Yeah, the data analysis

07:35.034 --> 07:37.920
on the laptop
from the Comescu compound.

07:37.987 --> 07:41.840
The last I heard, it was being
analyzed and authenticated.

07:41.891 --> 07:43.475
It's been three months.

07:43.543 --> 07:44.593
Kind of like to know

07:44.677 --> 07:46.678
why the Comescus
were trying to kill me.

07:48.231 --> 07:50.182
I can't answer that.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.433
You can't or you won't?

07:51.518 --> 07:52.901
'Cause if there's
information on that laptop

07:52.986 --> 07:54.553
that pertains
to my past,

07:54.604 --> 07:56.738
I have a right to know.

07:56.823 --> 07:58.574
Not my call.

07:58.658 --> 08:02.110
I will file a request
on your behalf.

08:02.195 --> 08:05.113
Of course, ultimately it's
Director Vance's decision.

08:06.332 --> 08:08.333
Of course.

08:11.004 --> 08:11.920
(typing)

08:12.005 --> 08:15.007
Anything else,
Agent Callen?

08:26.186 --> 08:27.319
(gunshot)

08:41.763 --> 08:44.665
Want to tell me what's going
on with you and Hunter?

08:44.716 --> 08:45.833
I don't trust her.

08:45.884 --> 08:47.434
You don't trust anybody.

08:47.502 --> 08:49.503
What else
is going on?

08:51.456 --> 08:53.674
You don't get the feeling
that she's holding out on us?

08:53.725 --> 08:54.942
You mean like Hetty does?

08:55.009 --> 08:57.895
Hunter is not Hetty.

08:57.979 --> 08:59.563
(doorbell rings)

08:59.648 --> 09:01.115
No, she is not,

09:01.182 --> 09:03.484
but I get a feeling they're
from the same species.

09:06.454 --> 09:08.706
NCIS for Mrs. Calder.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.861
I can't believe
this is happening.

09:13.912 --> 09:15.129
Who would do this?

09:15.196 --> 09:16.864
That's what we're
here to find out.

09:16.915 --> 09:18.749
All incoming calls will
be automatically forwarded

09:18.834 --> 09:20.918
to our operations center
for monitoring,

09:21.002 --> 09:24.388
trap, tracing,
voice recognition, et cetera.

09:24.472 --> 09:25.806
If you get a call
from somebody you know,

09:25.874 --> 09:27.224
just press the red button.

09:27.309 --> 09:29.844
It'll stop the procedure
for your own privacy.

09:29.895 --> 09:32.596
If, however, you get a call
concerning your husband,

09:32.681 --> 09:34.231
we'll all instantly
be alerted

09:34.316 --> 09:36.901
and conferenced in so we can
hear the call simultaneously.

09:36.985 --> 09:38.986
Shouldn't we have heard
something by now?

09:39.053 --> 09:41.221
Every case is different.

09:41.273 --> 09:44.158
Why would someone kidnap
my husband?

09:44.225 --> 09:46.610
We were hoping maybe
you could give us some answers.

09:46.695 --> 09:48.329
(door opens)
It's quite

09:48.396 --> 09:49.997
a security system
you've got here.

09:50.064 --> 09:54.335
Yeah, that's Dennis's doing.

09:54.402 --> 09:55.502
Lot of good
it did him.

09:55.570 --> 09:56.904
SAM:
Have you had security issues

09:56.955 --> 09:58.789
in the past?
No.

09:58.874 --> 10:00.791
Is there anyone who might
want to harm your husband?

10:00.876 --> 10:02.793
I don't know.

10:02.878 --> 10:04.745
I keep trying to think.

10:04.796 --> 10:06.630
Business rivals, maybe.

10:06.715 --> 10:08.766
Two of his friends from
college were trying to sue him

10:08.850 --> 10:10.100
for stealing their ideas,

10:10.185 --> 10:12.019
but he just said
they were jealous

10:12.086 --> 10:13.888
and it went with the territory.

10:13.939 --> 10:15.356
I gave the police
their names.

10:15.423 --> 10:17.424
Do you know this woman?

10:20.362 --> 10:22.279
No.

10:22.364 --> 10:24.031
Was she with him
when he was grabbed?

10:24.098 --> 10:26.283
Yes.

10:26.368 --> 10:27.418
BOY: Hey, Mom,
can I go to...?

10:27.485 --> 10:30.888
Shawn, this is Agent
Callen and Agent Hanna.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.389
They're here to
help find your dad.

10:33.708 --> 10:34.925
You guys with the FBI?

10:34.993 --> 10:35.926
Naval Criminal

10:35.961 --> 10:37.411
Investigative Service.

10:37.479 --> 10:40.331
We're gonna do everything we
can to help find your father.

10:40.398 --> 10:41.398
Thanks.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.117
Can I go to Jason's?

10:44.169 --> 10:46.053
No. I don't think
that's a good idea, honey.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.923
I need him to help me
with my homework.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.675
You were supposed to ask
your teacher about a tutor.

10:53.127 --> 10:55.930
Uh, why don't you have
Jason come over, okay?

10:55.981 --> 10:58.065
You can order a pizza.

10:58.132 --> 11:00.317
Yeah, okay.

11:00.402 --> 11:01.585
Nice meeting you.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.320
Take care.

11:09.194 --> 11:11.144
Dennis has been away

11:11.196 --> 11:13.697
from home so much
that Sean and I

11:13.782 --> 11:15.749
are both used
to him not being here.

11:15.817 --> 11:17.584
But it doesn't make it
any easier.

11:17.652 --> 11:20.254
Was your husband seeing
somebody else

11:20.321 --> 11:22.506
on a regular basis?

11:23.792 --> 11:26.010
Probably.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.762
If nothing else,
he's been discreet.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.965
He spends a lot of
time travelling.

11:31.016 --> 11:33.517
Dennis wasn't ready
to settle down,

11:33.601 --> 11:35.552
but I got pregnant,
and he takes

11:35.637 --> 11:36.887
good care of us.

11:36.972 --> 11:39.339
He just prefers to
live a separate life.

11:39.391 --> 11:40.724
(phone buzzing)

11:40.809 --> 11:42.726
Excuse me.

11:44.029 --> 11:45.062
What's up, Kensi?

11:45.130 --> 11:46.780
So, the driver,
Nicky Delamico, is dead.

11:46.848 --> 11:48.065
According to the surgeon,

11:48.149 --> 11:49.984
they did everything
they could to save him,

11:50.035 --> 11:52.336
but the bullet turned
all his vital organs to mush,

11:52.404 --> 11:53.504
so he died in recovery.

11:53.571 --> 11:55.622
Okay. Well, see if you can find
anything else.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.691
We'll meet up with you
when you get back.

11:57.742 --> 11:58.959
Okay.

11:59.027 --> 12:00.077
Patient's belongings

12:00.145 --> 12:03.414
and his chart,
courtesy of Nurse Wendy.

12:03.498 --> 12:05.249
Oh, Wendy!

12:05.333 --> 12:07.251
Yeah?

12:08.536 --> 12:09.703
Okay.
Wendy.

12:09.754 --> 12:11.472
You and your nurses,
you know that?

12:11.539 --> 12:14.374
It's an honorable profession
for which I have a great deal

12:14.426 --> 12:15.726
of admiration and respect.

12:15.810 --> 12:19.763
Maybe while we're here,
I should get you neutered.

12:19.848 --> 12:21.715
According to the chart,

12:21.766 --> 12:23.901
Calder's driver had cocaine
in his system.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.404
Oh, well, hello.

12:27.489 --> 12:30.524
Looks like
that's not all he had.

12:31.776 --> 12:33.560
KENSI:
Turns out Nicholas Delamico,

12:33.611 --> 12:35.395
aka Nicky the driver,

12:35.447 --> 12:36.663
was a sheriff's deputy

12:36.731 --> 12:38.665
who lost his job
following the disappearance

12:38.733 --> 12:39.917
of evidence narcotics.

12:40.001 --> 12:41.335
He was never convicted,
but the fact

12:41.402 --> 12:43.504
they found cocaine in his
system at the time he was shot

12:43.571 --> 12:45.572
suggests they may have
been on the right track.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.925
So, you're thinking Nicky
got his boss, Calder, involved

12:48.009 --> 12:49.593
in something shady,
drugs or something?

12:49.677 --> 12:50.794
It's a possibility.

12:50.879 --> 12:52.245
So why hasn't there been
a ransom call?

12:52.297 --> 12:53.764
Maybe they wanted him dead?

12:53.848 --> 12:55.160
So shoot him in the street.

12:55.161 --> 12:56.287
Maybe they needed
something from him?

12:56.758 --> 12:58.610
Yeah, maybe Calder's guilty
of the cyber-attack.

12:59.187 --> 13:01.688
He knows the NSA is watching,
he feels them closing in.

13:01.756 --> 13:04.257
His only chance of getting
away is if he disappears.

13:04.309 --> 13:06.426
So he fakes his own kidnapping.

13:06.478 --> 13:07.861
Well, that would mean
walking away from his family.

13:07.929 --> 13:10.364
According to his wife,
that happened a long time ago.

13:10.431 --> 13:12.116
DEEKS: That would also means
shooting and killing

13:12.200 --> 13:13.867
his driver.

13:13.935 --> 13:15.786
Everything has a price.
I got another theory.

13:17.038 --> 13:18.655
Looked at all
the other surveillance feeds,

13:18.740 --> 13:20.107
and with a little
digital enhancement,

13:20.158 --> 13:21.742
was able to zoom in closer.

13:21.793 --> 13:23.377
(computer chirps)

13:23.444 --> 13:25.779
Any idea what she's saying,
Kens?

13:25.830 --> 13:26.914
ERIC:
I ran the footage

13:26.965 --> 13:27.798
through a lip reader program.

13:27.882 --> 13:29.550
Excuse me?

13:29.617 --> 13:32.820
(Kensi laughs)

13:32.887 --> 13:35.472
A computer program
can't duplicate

13:35.557 --> 13:37.808
a skilled human lip reader.

13:37.892 --> 13:39.343
ERIC:
Well, the

13:39.427 --> 13:42.262
software suggests she's saying
something about gambling.

13:43.848 --> 13:45.149
Gambling.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.401
(computer chirps)

13:53.575 --> 13:55.609
It's possible.

13:57.862 --> 14:00.831
Might explain the 20 large
he was holding.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.583
Sam and I will take
Nicky's apartment.

14:02.650 --> 14:03.834
You check out
Calder's office.

14:03.918 --> 14:05.369
Find out if he's got
a gambling problem.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.620
Done.

14:16.264 --> 14:19.499
SAM: This have something to do
with what happened in Romania?

14:19.551 --> 14:20.934
Calder?

14:21.002 --> 14:22.803
Whatever's going on
with you and Hunter?

14:22.854 --> 14:24.888
Nothing going on
with me and Hunter.

14:24.973 --> 14:27.391
She recovered
some information that I need.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.193
Information about
your past?

14:29.277 --> 14:30.611
Possibly.

14:30.678 --> 14:33.680
And you think she's purposely
holding out on you?

14:33.731 --> 14:36.700
Yeah, and I think
she might not be the only one.

14:36.784 --> 14:38.452
(phone chimes)

14:38.519 --> 14:39.620
(beep)

14:39.687 --> 14:41.622
Hetty.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.740
Uncanny timing,
don't you think?

14:43.825 --> 14:46.526
According to Hetty,

14:46.578 --> 14:48.295
the mystery woman
from the surveillance video

14:48.362 --> 14:50.380
is wearing shoes
from an L.A. designer

14:50.465 --> 14:53.000
that are only available
at a couple of local retailers.

14:53.051 --> 14:54.218
She's trying to help.

14:54.302 --> 14:57.337
If she really wants to help,
she can get rid of Hunter.

14:57.388 --> 14:59.256
(phone chimes)

14:59.340 --> 15:00.540
What now?

15:00.592 --> 15:02.759
"Make sure
to keep Hunter in the loop."

15:06.380 --> 15:08.565
How does she do that?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.901
WOMAN: I'm sorry. I've never
seen her before.

15:10.985 --> 15:12.719
Okay.

15:12.770 --> 15:14.705
How long have you
worked for Dennis Calder?

15:14.772 --> 15:16.223
Four years.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.991
Is your boss
a gambler?

15:18.059 --> 15:20.410
Not that I'm aware of.

15:20.495 --> 15:22.746
Does he make lots of trips
to Vegas, play online poker?

15:22.830 --> 15:24.031
Read racing forms?

15:24.082 --> 15:25.916
If he does, I've never seen it.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.086
Hmm. We'd love
to see his computer.

15:29.170 --> 15:32.122
I'm sorry, I can't do that,
not without a warrant.

15:32.207 --> 15:34.574
The chances of finding
your boss alive decrease

15:34.626 --> 15:36.677
with each passing second.

15:43.584 --> 15:45.585
Oh, my God,
it's gone.

15:55.230 --> 15:56.897
MAN:
But with you being so tall...

15:56.948 --> 15:58.065
WOMAN:
Yeah, that's really good.

15:58.116 --> 15:59.933
Hmm. They bring
out your eyes.

15:59.984 --> 16:03.436
You don't even get
a whole shoe.

16:03.488 --> 16:04.204
WOMAN: In back?

16:04.272 --> 16:05.405
MAN:
Absolutely.

16:05.456 --> 16:07.374
(phone rings)
WOMAN: Great.

16:07.441 --> 16:09.293
Please tell me
you have better news.

16:09.377 --> 16:11.461
KENSI: No, it's actually
getting worse.

16:11.546 --> 16:13.297
We're watching
surveillance video taken

16:13.381 --> 16:15.749
less than an hour after
Dennis Calder was grabbed.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.884
Two men used his
pass codes and swipe card

16:17.952 --> 16:19.970
to get into his office,
and took everything--

16:20.054 --> 16:21.805
computer, files,
the works.

16:21.873 --> 16:23.123
- Same guys that kidnapped him?
- Could be.

16:23.174 --> 16:24.958
CALLEN: All right,
get anything useful to Eric.

16:25.009 --> 16:27.060
We're chasing down
a tip from Hetty.

16:27.128 --> 16:28.962
- Hetty?
CALLEN: Don't ask.

16:29.013 --> 16:31.515
Someone took Calder's
work computer.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.850
May I help you, gentlemen?

16:33.935 --> 16:35.135
Oh.

16:35.186 --> 16:36.903
You know
this person?

16:36.971 --> 16:38.138
Uh,

16:38.189 --> 16:39.906
yes. She's a client.

16:41.976 --> 16:43.643
I believe
her name is Elizabeth.

16:43.695 --> 16:45.645
Do you believe
you know

16:45.697 --> 16:47.647
her last name
or her address?

16:47.699 --> 16:49.533
It should be in the system.
Let me check.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.418
Would either of you like
a glass of champagne

16:51.485 --> 16:52.586
or wine while you wait?

16:52.653 --> 16:55.255
We're good. Thanks.

16:55.323 --> 16:56.673
Oh.
(sighs)

16:56.758 --> 16:58.842
Something tells me if Willy
Loman had worked here,

16:58.926 --> 17:01.094
he'd still be alive.
MAN: I need the computer.

17:01.162 --> 17:05.048
Arthur Miller?
<i>Death of a Salesman?</i>

17:05.133 --> 17:07.217
No, I get it. Thanks.

17:07.301 --> 17:08.685
Uh-huh.

17:21.898 --> 17:24.568
(knocking)

17:25.619 --> 17:27.738
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

17:30.425 --> 17:31.575
(tires squealing)

17:31.659 --> 17:33.243
I'll cut her off.

17:33.328 --> 17:35.746
(engine revving)

17:37.915 --> 17:40.183
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

17:40.251 --> 17:41.335
(engine revs, tires squeal)

17:45.089 --> 17:46.890
(grunting)

17:48.309 --> 17:51.311
(grunting, dog barking)

17:52.347 --> 17:54.014
(tires squealing)

17:56.000 --> 17:59.920
(tires squealing)

18:01.339 --> 18:02.489
(sighs)
CALLEN: Federal agents!

18:02.556 --> 18:03.323
Get out of the car!

18:04.859 --> 18:07.077
(dog barking)

18:20.562 --> 18:23.348
CALLEN: How long have you been
dating Dennis Calder?

18:23.432 --> 18:25.299
About six months.

18:25.351 --> 18:26.517
You knew he was married?

18:26.602 --> 18:28.636
We were just friends
at first.

18:28.687 --> 18:31.639
We met at a conference
about four years ago.

18:31.690 --> 18:34.475
And you have no idea who
would want to hurt him?

18:34.526 --> 18:35.910
No.

18:35.978 --> 18:37.478
Was he a gambler?

18:37.529 --> 18:38.646
He used to play

18:38.714 --> 18:40.081
in the underground
Hollywood poker games

18:40.148 --> 18:41.482
with big money
celebrities.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.317
But he promised me
he'd given that up.

18:43.369 --> 18:44.819
What about drugs?

18:44.870 --> 18:47.288
Never. I wouldn't be with him
if he was.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.159
Did he ever mention
anything to you

18:52.211 --> 18:53.661
about hacking into
government servers?

18:53.712 --> 18:55.162
No.

18:55.214 --> 18:56.381
SAM:
He ever talk

18:56.465 --> 18:57.432
to you about the work

18:57.499 --> 18:58.349
he was doing?

18:58.434 --> 19:00.051
Not lately.

19:00.135 --> 19:01.970
Dennis has been more interested

19:02.021 --> 19:04.005
in spending money
than making it.

19:04.056 --> 19:05.840
Is that what
attracted you to him?

19:05.891 --> 19:08.893
I make my own money.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.561
Dennis was fun.

19:10.646 --> 19:13.114
He liked to enjoy life,
have a good time.

19:13.181 --> 19:15.283
He put things in perspective.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.285
What about these college buddies

19:17.352 --> 19:19.353
that accused him
of stealing their ideas?

19:19.405 --> 19:20.788
That's old news.

19:20.856 --> 19:22.707
Besides, computer geeks--
they'll attack you online.

19:22.791 --> 19:25.293
They won't jump
out of vans with guns.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.462
No, but they can
hire people who do.

19:27.529 --> 19:29.414
Anything else you can tell
us about the kidnapping?

19:29.498 --> 19:31.249
Clothes?
Jewelry? Voices?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.301
I mean, did anyone
call anyone by name?

19:33.368 --> 19:35.420
- Did you see any tattoos?
- I'm sorry.

19:35.504 --> 19:37.055
It all happened so fast.

19:37.139 --> 19:39.307
Once I started running,
I didn't look back.

19:42.811 --> 19:44.729
And why didn't you go
to the police?

19:44.813 --> 19:47.732
I was scared
and had nothing to tell them.

19:51.153 --> 19:55.056
Dennis is in some serious
trouble, isn't he?

19:59.244 --> 20:00.912
So, what do you think?

20:00.996 --> 20:02.947
I think she's stupid for dating

20:03.032 --> 20:04.449
a married man.

20:04.516 --> 20:06.417
Right, but is she
telling the truth?

20:06.502 --> 20:07.752
CALLEN:
Probably.

20:07.836 --> 20:10.455
Not that it helps us any.

20:10.539 --> 20:12.673
Well, we still have
Nicky the driver's apartment.

20:12.741 --> 20:14.425
Maybe we'll find something
there.

20:14.510 --> 20:17.712
ERIC: Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt,
but, uh, somebody logged on

20:17.763 --> 20:19.246
to the Calder's
home security network,

20:19.298 --> 20:21.099
using Dennis Calder's password.

20:21.183 --> 20:23.584
Could be the same guys
who took his computer.

20:23.635 --> 20:24.769
- I can shut them down.
CALLEN: No.

20:24.837 --> 20:26.220
See if you can trace
the IP address

20:26.271 --> 20:27.421
of the person
who logged on

20:27.473 --> 20:28.856
and try and find us a location.

20:28.924 --> 20:30.942
I'm on it.

20:31.026 --> 20:33.311
Maybe we should put a security
team on Calder's wife and son.

20:33.379 --> 20:34.312
They could be targets.

20:34.396 --> 20:35.480
Unless you're right

20:35.564 --> 20:36.647
and the kidnapping was faked,

20:36.732 --> 20:37.648
in which case,
this could just be

20:37.733 --> 20:38.699
Calder checking in
on his family.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.267
Better safe than sorry.

20:40.319 --> 20:42.269
Yeah, Sam's right.

20:42.321 --> 20:44.872
But we got to
make sure no one,

20:44.940 --> 20:47.125
including Calder, knows
we got people in his house.

20:47.209 --> 20:48.626
Sounded like the son
was struggling in school.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.661
Maybe mom hired a tutor.

20:50.746 --> 20:53.047
If Dad's as absent as she says,

20:53.115 --> 20:54.215
he'd probably never know
the difference.

20:54.282 --> 20:55.616
I'll go in as a tutor.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.786
Deeks can go in as a dog walker
or something like that.

20:58.854 --> 21:00.421
Okay, why couldn't
I go in as a tutor,

21:00.472 --> 21:01.739
and you go in
as a dog walker?

21:01.807 --> 21:02.957
It's called a mirror.

21:03.008 --> 21:04.809
How dare you, sir.
Has anyone else here

21:04.834 --> 21:06.034
law school.

21:06.228 --> 21:07.979
Hmm? No?

21:08.063 --> 21:10.231
Anyone here pass the bar exam
in the state of California?

21:10.298 --> 21:12.299
Anyone?

21:12.351 --> 21:14.102
Anyone?

21:15.187 --> 21:16.470
KENSI:
This coming from a guy

21:16.522 --> 21:20.641
who learned how
to ties his shoes at... 12?

21:20.692 --> 21:22.493
Really?

21:22.578 --> 21:25.029
I'm from L.A.
I grew up in sandals.

21:25.114 --> 21:27.031
(laughter)
You never wore running shoes?

21:27.116 --> 21:29.367
Hello, it's called Velcro.
Nice.

21:29.451 --> 21:30.818
What? It's good enough
for the astronauts.

21:30.869 --> 21:32.086
(laughs)

21:32.154 --> 21:33.254
Calder was cheating on his wife.

21:33.321 --> 21:35.322
Perhaps he wasn't
the only unfaithful one.

21:35.374 --> 21:37.208
Maybe his wife,
Heather,

21:37.292 --> 21:41.179
was cheating on him, too,
with the tennis instructor.

21:41.263 --> 21:42.380
What tennis instructor?

21:44.266 --> 21:46.333
You're going to look so cute
in those little white shorts.

21:46.385 --> 21:48.436
Oh.

21:48.503 --> 21:51.839
Each code needs to provide
detailed descriptions

21:51.890 --> 21:53.941
of what you wish to purchase
and from which vendors.

21:53.976 --> 21:55.426
Hetty's still got
Nell running around

21:55.494 --> 21:56.661
like the Energizer Bunny.

21:56.728 --> 21:57.895
She didn't give
Eric a chair

21:57.980 --> 21:59.430
for the first two
months he was here.

21:59.498 --> 22:01.182
That was just
to keep him awake.

22:01.233 --> 22:03.734
Think maybe she's grooming
Nell for something more?

22:03.819 --> 22:06.154
Even her ulterior motives
have ulterior motives.

22:06.205 --> 22:10.208
Hetty's a riddle wrapped in
a mystery inside an enigma,

22:10.292 --> 22:13.377
clutching a
hand grenade.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.546
Any luck with our
cyber Peeping Tom?

22:15.631 --> 22:16.964
Nope, not yet.

22:17.032 --> 22:18.166
How about
the laptop

22:18.217 --> 22:20.151
that we pulled out of
the Comescu compound?

22:20.219 --> 22:22.753
The what?

22:22.838 --> 22:25.423
Excuse me, gentlemen.

22:25.507 --> 22:28.009
These are Agents
Callen and Hanna,

22:28.060 --> 22:30.144
and this is our technical
operator Eric Beale.

22:30.212 --> 22:31.312
This is Ms.
Patricia Michaels.

22:31.379 --> 22:33.264
She's from the
National Security Agency,

22:33.348 --> 22:34.348
and she is

22:34.399 --> 22:37.151
their cyber defense
specialist.

22:37.219 --> 22:39.070
She's here to help
us with the case.

22:39.154 --> 22:40.988
Eric, perhaps
you can bring

22:41.056 --> 22:42.406
Ms. Michaels up to speed
with where we are.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.742
CALLEN:
Could I speak with you

22:44.826 --> 22:45.826
alone?

22:45.894 --> 22:47.578
My office-- ten minutes.
I'd prefer

22:47.663 --> 22:49.864
to do it now and somewhere
a little more private

22:49.915 --> 22:52.950
than Hetty's office.

22:53.035 --> 22:55.870
HUNTER:
<i>Something</i>

22:55.921 --> 22:57.838
bothering you,
Agent Callen?

22:57.906 --> 23:00.041
I've got a lot of
things bothering me.

23:00.092 --> 23:01.375
Are they work-related,

23:01.426 --> 23:04.045
or do you need to speak
with a professional?

23:04.096 --> 23:05.796
Bringing anyone
outside of NCIS here

23:05.881 --> 23:07.598
is a gross breach of protocol.

23:07.683 --> 23:11.185
Ms. Michaels was
on this case before we were.

23:11.253 --> 23:13.938
She has top secret clearance
from the NSA.

23:14.022 --> 23:14.939
I don't care

23:15.023 --> 23:16.774
if she's the Man from U.N.C.L.E.

23:16.858 --> 23:18.309
We don't bring outsiders here.

23:18.393 --> 23:19.777
That's what the boatshed is for.

23:19.861 --> 23:21.779
Deeks is here.

23:21.863 --> 23:23.281
He's just a cop.

23:23.365 --> 23:24.649
Vetted by Hetty.

23:24.733 --> 23:26.784
And I vetted Ms. Michaels.

23:26.868 --> 23:28.319
You may resent
my authority, but...

23:28.403 --> 23:31.539
I resent being played.

23:31.606 --> 23:33.274
You familiar
he phrase

23:33.325 --> 23:35.710
"Don't hate the player,
hate the game"?

23:35.777 --> 23:38.129
I don't consider this a game.

23:38.213 --> 23:40.298
Don't mind me,

23:40.382 --> 23:41.882
just a worker bee.

23:41.950 --> 23:44.335
Ballistics report

23:44.419 --> 23:46.671
on Dennis Calder's
driver Nicky.

23:46.755 --> 23:51.092
He was killed by a fragmenting
explosive air entry round.

24:07.943 --> 24:10.194
KENSI: <i>Remember your order</i>
<i>of operations.</i>

24:10.279 --> 24:11.612
What do you do first?

24:11.663 --> 24:14.865
Uh, the stuff
in the brackets.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.367
Yes, good,

24:16.451 --> 24:17.918
anything in parentheticals.

24:17.986 --> 24:20.037
And then what?

24:20.122 --> 24:22.790
(grunts)

24:23.825 --> 24:26.043
You worried about your dad?

24:29.014 --> 24:31.015
When was the last time
you talked to him?

24:32.834 --> 24:34.602
Uh, I think he
texted me last week.

24:34.669 --> 24:35.603
Oh.

24:35.670 --> 24:38.389
You carry a gun?

24:38.473 --> 24:41.192
Sometimes.

24:41.276 --> 24:42.693
Can I see it?

24:42.778 --> 24:43.694
No.

24:43.779 --> 24:46.731
You ever shoot anybody?

24:46.815 --> 24:48.616
I think we have to get
back to your homework.

24:49.651 --> 24:52.153
You got a boyfriend?

24:53.521 --> 24:55.456
Homework.

24:55.523 --> 24:57.992
It's okay; I don't have
a girlfriend either.

24:58.043 --> 24:59.343
DEEKS:
Ouch.

24:59.411 --> 25:01.712
This kid may be flunking school,

25:01.797 --> 25:04.448
but tell you what, he's got
his teacher pegged pretty good.

25:12.307 --> 25:14.225
And I, uh, walked the perimeter.

25:14.309 --> 25:16.310
Everything seems pretty quiet.

25:18.230 --> 25:20.181
I'm ready for my lesson.

25:20.232 --> 25:23.267
Oh, wow, look at you
with your whole

25:23.352 --> 25:25.236
little tennis

25:25.320 --> 25:27.905
outfit and everything.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.740
Uh, did you want
to work on something,

25:29.808 --> 25:31.776
or should I just hit
a few balls around,

25:31.860 --> 25:33.894
and you can check
out my form?

25:33.945 --> 25:35.513
Yeah, no, I think
that's a good idea.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.498
We can have you hit
a few balls around,

25:37.565 --> 25:38.916
and then we can
check out your...

25:39.000 --> 25:40.584
form.

25:40.652 --> 25:42.453
(quietly):
You're a professional.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.071
You do this for a living.

25:44.122 --> 25:45.322
Lock it down.

25:47.092 --> 25:49.860
Lock it...

25:49.928 --> 25:51.545
Oh, sweet Lord.

25:51.596 --> 25:52.847
I got the balls.

25:52.914 --> 25:55.416
When you're ready,
I'll be on the court.

25:57.402 --> 26:00.271
Eric got an
IP address

26:00.355 --> 26:01.588
for whoever was
watching the Calders.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.308
Unfortunately they were
using the public Wi-Fi

26:04.393 --> 26:07.094
at the Culver City College
as a proxy server.

26:07.145 --> 26:08.679
You see the
ballistics report?

26:08.747 --> 26:10.314
Those guys
weren't messing around.

26:17.072 --> 26:19.573
Does Eric have

26:19.624 --> 26:21.292
any idea how many
computers are in here?

26:21.376 --> 26:22.827
ERIC: At the moment
there are 273 desktops

26:22.911 --> 26:23.828
for public use.

26:23.912 --> 26:24.829
There are
an additional...

26:24.913 --> 26:26.130
CALLEN:
Eric,

26:26.214 --> 26:27.715
we're gonna need a
little extra help.

26:27.782 --> 26:28.899
I can tell you
the make and model

26:28.967 --> 26:30.084
of the computer being used.
If his computer

26:30.135 --> 26:31.618
has a camera, we can
give you a picture

26:31.670 --> 26:32.887
of whoever's using it.
(grunts)

26:32.954 --> 26:33.921
NELL:
I'm sorry.

26:33.972 --> 26:35.172
Uh, yeah,

26:35.257 --> 26:36.474
that, too, but I,

26:36.558 --> 26:37.675
I can't guarantee that
he won't be alerted

26:37.759 --> 26:38.676
to the intrusion.

26:38.744 --> 26:40.227
It's a risk worth taking.

26:40.295 --> 26:42.146
If he logs off, we
may never find him.

26:42.230 --> 26:43.147
Okay,

26:43.231 --> 26:44.398
here goes nothing.

26:45.150 --> 26:47.101
(sighs)

26:50.989 --> 26:53.157
All right, we got him.

26:53.241 --> 26:54.859
Asian male, early to mid-20s,

26:54.943 --> 26:56.444
blue hoodie, dark red shirt.

27:01.967 --> 27:03.701
He's on to us.

27:07.456 --> 27:08.456
(grunts)

27:22.087 --> 27:23.670
(tires screeching)

27:30.678 --> 27:31.762
MAN:
Is he all right?

27:31.830 --> 27:34.398
I didn't see him.
He came out of nowhere.

27:50.173 --> 27:53.125
You Kuchan was a Chinese
foreign exchange student

27:53.209 --> 27:54.343
studying humanities

27:54.410 --> 27:56.628
at Culver City
Community College.

27:56.696 --> 27:58.213
Why would he be spying
on the Calders?

27:58.264 --> 28:00.099
- And why did he run?
HUNTER: Probably

28:00.166 --> 28:01.383
because you were chasing him.

28:01.434 --> 28:03.886
Of course,
we'll never know the truth

28:03.937 --> 28:05.804
now that he's dead.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.774
Where are we?

28:08.858 --> 28:10.359
All they found on him
was his college ID

28:10.426 --> 28:11.360
and a bus pass.

28:11.427 --> 28:13.562
Eric is tracking
an address.

28:13.613 --> 28:15.948
What about the laptop
he was using?

28:16.032 --> 28:17.116
MICHAELS: Most of it looks
like legitimate

28:17.200 --> 28:19.702
school projects,
a couple computer games,

28:19.769 --> 28:22.354
and the usual
social networking sites,

28:22.422 --> 28:23.889
but we're still looking.

28:23.957 --> 28:25.273
Let me know if you
find anything useful.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.663
She's starting
to grow on me.

28:33.282 --> 28:34.466
(Deeks grunts)

28:34.534 --> 28:35.534
Ooh.
I'm a jungle cat.

28:35.602 --> 28:36.502
What?
Okay.

28:36.586 --> 28:38.754
Stop moving.
(grunts)

28:38.805 --> 28:39.822
Thanks for the sitrep, Sam.

28:39.889 --> 28:40.806
I'll tell Deeks.

28:40.874 --> 28:41.807
Okay.

28:41.891 --> 28:43.275
DEEKS:
What, what, what you got?

28:43.343 --> 28:44.292
(Deeks grunts)

28:44.344 --> 28:45.344
(Shawn laughs)

28:47.230 --> 28:48.731
What the hell?

28:48.798 --> 28:50.566
I am so sorry.
No, don't be.

28:50.633 --> 28:51.984
This is the most fun
Shawn's had

28:52.068 --> 28:53.068
in weeks.

28:53.136 --> 28:53.852
(laughs)

28:55.271 --> 28:57.322
I wish his father would do
stuff like this with him.

28:57.407 --> 28:59.608
He's going through a
tough age, and now this.

28:59.659 --> 29:01.276
Yeah, but kids are
a lot more resilient

29:01.327 --> 29:03.195
than we sometimes give them
credit for, you know?

29:03.279 --> 29:04.196
SHAWN:
Stand still.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.414
I hope so.

29:05.481 --> 29:07.449
- Okay.
- Shawn used to try so hard

29:07.500 --> 29:08.700
to get his father's
attention.

29:08.785 --> 29:10.536
Then eventually he just gave up.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.004
SHAWN: This'll be
the one, I promise.

29:12.088 --> 29:15.040
(chuckles) I can't believe
your partner got him out.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.708
Ha.

29:16.793 --> 29:18.710
HEATHER: Shawn spends
most of his days

29:18.778 --> 29:20.379
stuck in his room
playing on his computer.

29:20.463 --> 29:23.265
I guess he gets that
from his father.

29:23.332 --> 29:26.268
Last year we caught him
changing his grades

29:26.335 --> 29:27.886
on his school computer system.

29:27.971 --> 29:29.438
DEEKS: Oh, I think I just
pulled a muscle.

29:29.505 --> 29:31.106
SHAWN: Okay, this is gonna
be the one. Ready?

29:31.174 --> 29:33.442
Jungle cat--
aah, jungle cat down!

29:33.509 --> 29:34.893
Whoo!

29:34.978 --> 29:36.962
(Shawn and Deeks
shouting indistinctly)

29:58.718 --> 30:00.669
(line ringing)

30:00.720 --> 30:01.670
This is Eric.

30:01.721 --> 30:03.555
Hey, Eric, it's Kensi.

30:03.623 --> 30:06.475
I have a laptop here
belonging to Shawn Calder.

30:06.542 --> 30:08.477
It's locked, but I've got
my IronClad plugged in.

30:08.544 --> 30:09.812
Can you get inside?

30:09.879 --> 30:10.813
Sure.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.814
Reboot through it.

30:11.881 --> 30:13.098
I'll take it from there.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.268
What am I looking for?

30:17.386 --> 30:18.386
Anything that can help us
figure out

30:18.438 --> 30:21.273
exactly why
his father's been abducted.

30:21.357 --> 30:22.557
What are you doing?

30:26.062 --> 30:28.247
KENSI: Shawn may not be doing
too well in school,

30:28.331 --> 30:31.166
but he's certainly inherited
his father's computer acumen.

30:31.234 --> 30:32.284
What do you mean?

30:32.368 --> 30:33.452
There was a cyber-attack

30:33.536 --> 30:35.420
on a Department of
Defense computer system

30:35.505 --> 30:38.023
a few weeks ago, and...

30:38.091 --> 30:39.625
it came from
Shawn's computer.

30:39.709 --> 30:40.626
What?

30:40.710 --> 30:43.262
Shawn, look at me.

30:43.346 --> 30:46.715
Now, I don't know if this
was an act of rebellion

30:46.766 --> 30:50.552
or teenage boredom
or just an attempt

30:50.603 --> 30:51.553
to get your
father's attention.

30:51.604 --> 30:53.555
He broke the law?
Several.

30:53.606 --> 30:55.274
I was just
hacking around.

30:55.358 --> 30:57.693
Your hacking around could have
disastrous consequences.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.895
Do you understand that?

31:01.047 --> 31:03.899
You think this kid could fix
my credit score?

31:03.950 --> 31:06.318
Kid's a computer wiz,
not Harry Potter.

31:07.570 --> 31:09.488
Well, this kid may have launched
the cyber-attack,

31:09.572 --> 31:12.124
but it doesn't explain
who kidnapped his dad or why.

31:12.208 --> 31:14.042
(alarm beeping)
This is not good.

31:14.110 --> 31:15.544
This is Eric.

31:15.611 --> 31:17.412
You find anything on Shawn's
computer that might help us?

31:17.463 --> 31:19.381
No. Maybe-- ok,

31:19.449 --> 31:22.251
I don't know, we may have
a bigger problem here.

31:22.302 --> 31:23.669
We were running You Kuchan

31:23.753 --> 31:25.504
through the facial recognition
database, and we got kicked off.

31:25.588 --> 31:28.123
The DOD
is under another cyber-attack,

31:28.174 --> 31:29.925
and this one is serious.

31:29.976 --> 31:31.727
MICHAELS: Eric, looks like the firewall's
about to be breached.

31:31.794 --> 31:33.729
DOD is going
to Protocol Alpha.

31:33.796 --> 31:35.364
Okay, I'm shutting
down everything

31:35.431 --> 31:37.015
that's not essential, sorry.

31:39.686 --> 31:41.904
KENSI: Who was with you when
you hacked into the database?

31:41.971 --> 31:43.405
No one.

31:43.472 --> 31:45.473
Someone just launched
another cyber-attack

31:45.525 --> 31:46.942
on the Department of Defense.

31:46.993 --> 31:49.578
Not me.
Who else did you hack?

31:49.646 --> 31:51.496
I don't know.
Shawn, we need answers

31:52.498 --> 31:54.666
and we need
A bunch of blogs,them right now.

31:54.751 --> 31:56.368
maybe a couple game sites.
Shawn Cameron Calder,

31:56.452 --> 31:57.669
you were told

31:57.754 --> 31:58.837
to stop doing that.

31:58.922 --> 32:00.789
Any foreign government sites?

32:00.840 --> 32:03.625
A couple.

32:03.676 --> 32:04.543
Which ones?

32:04.627 --> 32:06.461
Uh,

32:06.512 --> 32:08.380
Brazil
and France and...

32:08.464 --> 32:10.515
China.

32:10.583 --> 32:13.185
You Kuchan was a
Chinese national.

32:13.269 --> 32:15.887
All I did was take
a look around.

32:15.972 --> 32:18.357
I never unleashed any virus
or anything like that.

32:18.441 --> 32:21.860
But you broke
their best cyber security.

32:21.945 --> 32:24.446
That's exactly what
any foreign power

32:24.513 --> 32:26.398
would love to do against
the Department of Defense.

32:26.482 --> 32:29.484
If they traced the intrusion
back to your home IP address,

32:29.535 --> 32:31.903
they would have assumed
it was your dad,

32:31.988 --> 32:33.688
not his teenage son.

32:36.626 --> 32:39.328
They kidnapped my father
because of me?

32:45.051 --> 32:47.002
If the Chinese do have Calder,

32:47.053 --> 32:49.554
what are the chances
of us getting him back?

32:49.639 --> 32:50.589
Depends.

32:50.673 --> 32:52.674
On if he's still
in the country?

32:52.725 --> 32:55.210
Whether he's
still alive.

32:59.548 --> 33:00.548
(gunshot)

33:09.238 --> 33:10.455
Status report?

33:10.539 --> 33:14.225
Borderline panic verging
on controlled hysteria.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.228
Is this the same type
of attack as before?

33:17.296 --> 33:19.914
Better. More sophisticated
and multiple points of ingress.

33:19.966 --> 33:21.716
Shawn was one young
kid hacking around,

33:21.784 --> 33:24.336
albeit it with a sophisticated
program of his father's design.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.589
But this is an aggressive
assault on multiple fronts.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.307
It's like punching holes
in the hull of a ship.

33:29.392 --> 33:31.559
When you get a leak, you secure
that section of the ship,

33:31.627 --> 33:33.395
and patch the hole, but
when you get too many holes...

33:33.462 --> 33:34.863
Yeah, the ship sinks.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.148
You need to take a look
at the accident footage.

33:37.233 --> 33:38.900
I'm sorry.
We're a little busy here.

33:38.967 --> 33:41.803
We do not allow mailroom
employees in our OPS Center.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.523
Do you have something, Nell?

33:45.608 --> 33:47.975
Yeah.

33:49.078 --> 33:51.913
Um, if You Kuchan
was involved

33:51.980 --> 33:53.415
in Calder's abduction,

33:53.482 --> 33:55.000
then we know he had help.

33:55.084 --> 33:57.836
And if he's a foreign operative,
then he's probably

33:57.920 --> 33:59.387
working with a team.

33:59.455 --> 34:00.505
Let's see.

34:00.589 --> 34:03.758
Here's the car that hit him.

34:03.826 --> 34:06.094
Now, according to
the police report,

34:06.161 --> 34:07.679
driver's name is Alex Grinkov.

34:07.763 --> 34:09.431
See, he's idling here

34:09.498 --> 34:11.916
for a while as if he's
waiting for someone.

34:11.984 --> 34:14.018
But the moment
You Kuchan comes running out,

34:14.103 --> 34:16.888
he pulls away from the curb
and then runs him down.

34:16.956 --> 34:19.357
HUNTER: So, the minute that he was
compromised, his team

34:19.442 --> 34:20.525
took him out.
Mm-hmm.

34:20.609 --> 34:22.726
- Eric...
ERIC: Already on it.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.529
Alex Grinkov.

34:24.612 --> 34:26.114
He's a local
real estate agent.

34:26.181 --> 34:27.364
NELL:
See if there's...

34:27.449 --> 34:28.433
ERIC:
A common denominator

34:28.501 --> 34:30.101
between our college student,

34:30.168 --> 34:31.902
You Kuchan, and
Alex Grinkov.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.205
Already searching.

34:34.290 --> 34:35.373
(laughs)

34:35.458 --> 34:36.958
Nicely done, Ms. Jones.
Apprise me

34:37.025 --> 34:40.462
as soon as you find something
and alert Callen and his team.

34:46.302 --> 34:51.489
The only common vector between
You Kuchan and Alex Grinkov

34:51.556 --> 34:53.308
is the Garden of Peace
and Wellness.

34:53.375 --> 34:55.143
It's an acupuncture
and Chinese medicine center

34:55.210 --> 34:56.678
in the Valley.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.064
Both had the phone number
in their contacts,

34:59.148 --> 35:00.682
and both paid the
center numerous visits.

35:00.733 --> 35:03.935
So, either Alex Grinkov
and You Kuchan

35:04.019 --> 35:06.604
had a thing
for alternative medicine or...

35:06.689 --> 35:08.055
Or the Garden of Peace
and Wellness

35:08.107 --> 35:09.357
is a front of some sort.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.658
Place is a good cover.

35:10.726 --> 35:12.059
Lots of people come and go.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.361
KENSI: Perfect place
for operatives

35:13.429 --> 35:15.196
to exchange information
in private.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.898
And according to Eric,
the data flow

35:16.949 --> 35:18.416
on the center's fiber-optic line

35:18.501 --> 35:20.785
spiked tenfold since the
DOD came under attack.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.871
SAM: So, if Calder's
being held in there,

35:22.938 --> 35:24.539
how do we want to do this?

35:34.550 --> 35:35.800
Hi.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.635
Could I get a new
patient form, please?

35:37.720 --> 35:39.220
Fill out both forms
front and back,

35:39.271 --> 35:41.389
and I'll need a copy of
your health insurance card.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.692
Okay. And is there
a restroom that I could use?

35:44.760 --> 35:46.761
Right down the
hall, to the left.

35:56.104 --> 35:57.489
MICHAELS:
<i>Okay, we're good to go.</i>

35:57.573 --> 35:59.440
We circumvented
the DOD mainframes

35:59.492 --> 36:00.792
and are getting a satellite feed

36:00.876 --> 36:02.293
direct from
the Tactical Ground Station.

36:02.378 --> 36:04.045
ERIC:
Switching to thermal.

36:04.112 --> 36:06.581
Looks like we got four people
in one room

36:06.632 --> 36:07.949
in the northwest corner.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.001
Sending the building layout
to your phones.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.553
(cell phone chimes)

36:11.620 --> 36:15.089
CALLEN: Eyes on Grinkov,
west side of building.

36:17.893 --> 36:19.894
(door opening)

36:22.598 --> 36:24.983
CALLEN (over radio): We need a
full blackout on my signal now,

36:25.067 --> 36:27.068
just as soon as all
the civilians are out.

36:27.135 --> 36:28.736
(grunts)

36:28.804 --> 36:30.522
Not a problem.

36:30.606 --> 36:31.973
You're on, Kensi.

36:39.915 --> 36:41.983
Fire in the hole.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.485
(smoke canister hissing)

36:46.172 --> 36:49.991
(fire alarm blaring)

36:57.165 --> 36:59.517
(woman giving evacuation orders)

36:59.602 --> 37:00.969
Right this way.

37:01.020 --> 37:03.805
(people coughing)

37:03.856 --> 37:05.390
All right, everyone...

37:09.011 --> 37:10.612
Set.
Go, Nell.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.577
CALLEN: Deeks, Kensi, clear the front
of the building.

37:26.629 --> 37:28.630
- Clear.
- Clear.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.053
Clear.

37:35.137 --> 37:36.971
DEEKS:
East side of the building clear.

37:38.373 --> 37:41.142
(rapid gunfire)

37:41.209 --> 37:43.711
CALLEN: Deeks, Kensi,
shooters coming your way!

37:49.885 --> 37:51.102
Grinkov's down.

37:54.389 --> 37:56.357
Federal agents!
Clear!

38:08.170 --> 38:09.203
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

38:09.255 --> 38:10.505
I hope you're the good guys.

38:10.572 --> 38:12.457
If we weren't,
you'd be dead.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.791
We've got Calder.

38:13.876 --> 38:15.576
Lights, Nell.

38:20.349 --> 38:22.033
How'd you find me?

38:22.101 --> 38:23.351
It was your son.

38:23.418 --> 38:25.019
Shawn?

38:25.087 --> 38:26.971
You just got a
second chance

38:27.056 --> 38:28.356
to spend time with your boy.

38:28.423 --> 38:30.358
Don't blow it.

38:36.582 --> 38:37.548
(Kensi sighs
with relief)

38:37.616 --> 38:39.033
Anyone up for a beer?

38:39.101 --> 38:40.902
Yes, please.

38:40.953 --> 38:43.154
Really? Not you guys?

38:43.238 --> 38:44.489
Okay.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.040
My treat.

38:46.108 --> 38:47.792
Now we're talking.
I'm in.

38:47.876 --> 38:49.410
You guys are such
cheap bastards.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.413
HUNTER: Despite a less-than-
auspicious start,

38:52.464 --> 38:55.883
you guys did a nice job
containing this.

38:55.951 --> 38:57.468
The Chinese government
is already

38:57.553 --> 38:59.420
distancing itself
from You Kuchan

38:59.471 --> 39:00.922
and denying any
involvement

39:00.973 --> 39:02.724
with Dennis Calder's
abduction

39:02.791 --> 39:05.643
or the subsequent
cyber attacks.

39:05.728 --> 39:08.896
They're blaming it all on a
Tibetan separatist group.

39:08.964 --> 39:11.966
Those pesky monks.

39:20.676 --> 39:23.494
So yeah, like I said, um...

39:23.579 --> 39:25.747
nice job.

39:31.954 --> 39:34.172
Should I have invited her
to come with us?

39:34.256 --> 39:35.590
God, no.
I don't know.

39:35.657 --> 39:38.393
I bet she lets that hair down
after a couple of cosmos,

39:38.460 --> 39:40.962
starts dancing on the table,
doing body shots.

39:41.013 --> 39:42.680
KENSI: His favorite movie
is <i>Coyote Ugly.</i>

39:42.765 --> 39:44.716
DEEKS:
I still cry every time

39:44.800 --> 39:46.351
Jersey gets
that recording contract.

39:46.435 --> 39:47.769
CALLEN:
See you guys tomorrow.

39:47.836 --> 39:49.887
KENSI:
Wait, Callen, come on.

39:49.972 --> 39:51.973
Let him go.
Why? Where is he going?

39:52.024 --> 39:54.025
Let him go.

40:11.293 --> 40:14.162
So this is how
you recuperate.

40:22.004 --> 40:25.339
I was wondering how long
it would take you to visit me.

40:26.374 --> 40:28.375
How are things
at work?

40:31.013 --> 40:33.898
Well, I'm sure you know
better than me.

40:34.983 --> 40:36.884
You and Hunter playing nice?

40:39.204 --> 40:41.022
When are you coming back?

40:41.073 --> 40:43.357
Soon enough.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.494
You owe me some answers.

40:46.561 --> 40:48.196
Is that so?

40:49.397 --> 40:51.916
Answers to what specifically?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.734
What happened in Romania.

40:53.786 --> 40:55.119
Why I knew that beach.

40:55.204 --> 40:56.454
Who my mom was.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.508
All of it.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.795
You knew things
you never told me.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.014
Why?

41:07.082 --> 41:09.100
If I didn't
tell you something,

41:09.184 --> 41:12.103
it was for your own good.

41:12.187 --> 41:14.439
To protect you.

41:17.059 --> 41:19.894
I deserve the truth.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.447
Ah, the truth.

41:22.531 --> 41:24.482
It's not always so simple.

41:24.566 --> 41:28.453
I don't have all the answers
you think I do.

41:28.537 --> 41:32.406
The last thing I ever wanted
to give you was false hope.

41:33.441 --> 41:36.744
I know how much it
all means to you.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.380
Do you?

41:44.052 --> 41:47.454
Something tells me
everything I want to know--

41:47.506 --> 41:51.458
everything I deserve to
know-- is right here.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.129
Am I right?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.131
No.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.467
But go ahead and open it
if you don't trust me.

42:16.451 --> 42:20.037
I will find out who I am
and who my family was

42:20.122 --> 42:22.707
with or without
anyone's help.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.848
(sighs)

42:34.636 --> 42:36.554
