AARON MAHNKE: In 1903,

00:15.683 --> 00:18.519
the 100 residents of a
small town in Virginia

00:18.561 --> 00:20.062
didn't want the patients

00:20.104 --> 00:21.981
living at the nearby insane asylum

00:22.022 --> 00:24.066
to be their neighbors.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.152
They voted, and it was agreed

00:26.193 --> 00:28.279
that the inmates would be relocated

00:28.320 --> 00:30.322
and the asylum closed.

00:30.364 --> 00:34.326
The patients were transferred
to the Lorton Reformatory,

00:34.368 --> 00:37.455

00:38.748 --> 00:40.249
The vehicle swerved,

00:40.291 --> 00:41.959

Two patients escaped into the woods...

00:47.923 --> 00:51.510
Marcus Wallster and Douglas Grifon,

00:51.552 --> 00:53.888
a man who'd murdered his wife and child

00:53.929 --> 00:56.015
on Easter Sunday.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.852
A manhunt discovered a
trail of half-eaten rabbits

00:59.894 --> 01:02.813
left on the ground and
hanging in the trees.

01:02.855 --> 01:06.942
The trail led the officers
to one of the escaped inmates.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.738
Marcus Wallster was found

01:10.780 --> 01:12.907
hanging from a railroad bridge,

01:12.948 --> 01:15.993
a crude, self-made ax in one hand

01:16.035 --> 01:18.078
and a note attached to his foot.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.415
It read "You'll never

The other fugitive, Douglas Grifon,

01:25.544 --> 01:27.546
was the Bunny Man.

hanging from the bridge.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.577

he'd been hit by a train and killed.

lobe to the thalamus.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.077
He heard about the work

13:47.118 --> 13:49.371
of an Italian doctor
who developed a technique

13:49.412 --> 13:51.831
to reach the brain
through the eye sockets.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.752
This was the shortcut
Freeman was looking for.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.422
By inserting a large needle

13:59.464 --> 14:01.967
into the skull through the eye socket,

14:02.008 --> 14:04.427
he would wiggle it

14:04.469 --> 14:07.222
to sever the nerves in the frontal lobe.

14:07.264 --> 14:11.142
He called the procedure
the transorbital lobotomy.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.187
It was quick, it was cheap,

so that he could snap a picture.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.986

the second Orbitoclast.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.581
And my wife Marjorie.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.251
as the first Orbitoclast.

A... An ice pick.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.798
That's right. Ha ha ha!

15:23.840 --> 15:25.925
An ice pick, right off
our kitchen counter.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.345
I needed a stiff, you
know, sharp object,

15:28.386 --> 15:29.888

But here today we have Allan.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.649
Allan suffers from chronic depression.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.359
He's tried to kill himself.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.819
He's visiting us today
from Saint Elizabeth's.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.448
The problems of our mental
hospitals cannot be met

chronically disturbed patients

15:51.951 --> 15:53.995

of the transorbital leucotomy

only $25 to the patient.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.820
only one patient has died
on the day of the procedure.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.656
Two died days later from
bleeding in the brain,

16:29.698 --> 16:32.075
and six patients, uh,

16:32.117 --> 16:35.453
suffered convulsions
or other complications.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.330
But don't be nervous, Allan.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.500

performed here in the office.

get his pilot's license.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.134
Another's an orchestra violinist.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.177
Many have been married
since the procedure.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.556
Now true, immediately after a lobotomy,

16:54.597 --> 16:57.851

to the point of elation

16:57.892 --> 17:00.311

17:01.855 --> 17:04.398

Patients demonstrate a
lack of trustworthiness,

cleanliness, or reverence.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.009
Bill, can you at least wait
till you see how it's done?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.719
The only thing this accomplishes

17:32.761 --> 17:35.764
is making it easier for
those who are nursing them.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.391
Bill, you know what my favorite
definition of genius is?

17:38.433 --> 17:42.479
Genius is the ability to
put the cart before the horse

17:42.520 --> 17:45.440
and make them both run.

17:50.403 --> 17:54.824
So, fellas, follow here
as I lift Allan's eyelid.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.371
I'll then take my small mallet,

18:00.413 --> 18:04.751

bone is very, very thin,

18:04.793 --> 18:08.004

18:19.182 --> 18:21.017
Oh, Bill.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.188
I guess Bill won't be
staying for the second one.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.415
We'll extract the Orbitoclast,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.836
and that's all there is to it.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.050
Now, Allan will suffer
a couple black eyes,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.719
but we send them home with
a fine pair of new sunglasses

18:56.761 --> 18:58.513
so they're not too embarrassed

18:58.555 --> 19:00.098
when they see their friends
back at St. Elizabeth's.

His shuddering should slow down

check on Bill there?

I don't think his pulse is
nearly as good as Allan's.

19:15.822 --> 19:20.451
1946 was a rocket ride
for Walter Freeman.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.121
America had just defeated fascism,

19:23.162 --> 19:26.916
and people saw possibility
and potential everywhere,

19:26.958 --> 19:30.211
and they embraced his
radical new procedure.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.214
"Any damn fool could
learn it," Freeman joked.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.342
And he set off across
the country to prove it.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.681
For cash-strapped institutions,

19:41.723 --> 19:44.058
it was impossible to resist a procedure

19:44.100 --> 19:47.353
that could deliver such
apparent relief so easily.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.864

20:01.367 --> 20:03.411
Buoyed by his growing popularity.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.748
Freeman began promising more.

20:06.789 --> 20:10.168
The lobotomy, he maintained,
could provide relief

20:10.209 --> 20:12.962
for non-institutionalized
patients as well,

20:13.004 --> 20:15.423
like Warner Baxter.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.634
Baxter was the second man ever

20:17.675 --> 20:20.678
to take home an Academy
Award for best actor,

20:20.720 --> 20:23.264
and he remained one of
the highest paid actors

20:23.306 --> 20:24.933
in the 1940s.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.186
But by 1950, he was plagued by arthritis

20:28.227 --> 20:31.731
that was so crippling that he
had trouble feeding himself.

20:31.773 --> 20:35.610
So in 1951, he famously
underwent a lobotomy

20:35.652 --> 20:37.570
in search of relief.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.739
Freeman had moved the lobotomy

20:39.781 --> 20:42.158
from the fringes to the mainstream.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.499
One of Freeman's most
noted cases, however,

20:49.540 --> 20:51.209
from years earlier,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.795
had been kept tightly under wraps.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.047
But that secrecy

20:56.089 --> 20:58.967
wasn't intended to protect
Freeman's reputation.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.682
Rosemary Kennedy was the third

21:05.723 --> 21:08.351
of Joe and Rose Kennedy's nine children.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.855
In 1918, Rose suddenly went
into labor with Rosemary.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.525
The nurse was reluctant
to deliver the baby

21:15.566 --> 21:17.360
without a doctor present.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.154
She ordered Rose to keep
her legs tightly shut

21:20.196 --> 21:22.407
in an effort to delay the birth.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.243
It didn't work, and she
forced the baby's head

21:25.284 --> 21:27.245
back into the birth canal.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.914
For two agonizing hours,

21:29.956 --> 21:33.251
baby Rosemary was deprived
of sufficient oxygen,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.628
and this caused her
lasting brain damage.

21:37.380 --> 21:41.217
Rosemary was a joyful, exuberant child,

21:41.259 --> 21:43.511
but she often experienced seizures

21:43.553 --> 21:45.096
and violent tantrums,

21:45.138 --> 21:48.141
and she struggled intellectually.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.726
In a family renowned

21:49.767 --> 21:52.270
for brilliant, striving overachievers,

21:52.311 --> 21:54.605
the frustration and
feeling of inferiority

21:54.647 --> 21:55.982
must have been unbearable.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.278
In response, Rosemary acted out.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.907
Fearing that scandal might threaten

22:04.949 --> 22:07.577
his other children's
political prospects,

22:07.618 --> 22:09.287
and without consulting his wife,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.372
Joseph Kennedy brought
his troubled daughter

22:11.414 --> 22:13.624
to Walter Freeman and James Watts

22:13.666 --> 22:15.460
for a prefrontal lobotomy.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.101
The lobotomy left Rosemary Kennedy

22:32.143 --> 22:33.853
permanently disabled.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.939
Initially, she could
only speak a few words.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.736
She never regained the
full use of one arm,

22:41.778 --> 22:43.613
and she walked with a limp.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.366
Consigned to a church-run
facility in Wisconsin,

22:47.408 --> 22:49.786
the rebellious and
free-spirited Rosemary

22:49.827 --> 22:53.164
had been more or less
silenced by the age of 23.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.470
On July 8, 1946,

23:07.512 --> 23:10.556
Freeman took his two
young sons Randy and Keen,

23:10.598 --> 23:13.267
along with a nephew, on a camping trip.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.521
They planned to hike in
Yosemite National Park,

23:16.562 --> 23:18.815
climbing along Vernal Falls,

23:18.856 --> 23:23.152
325 feet off the Merced River.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.738
While hiking along the river's edge,

23:25.780 --> 23:30.118
Keen bent down to refill his canteen.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.537
I heard Keen shout.

23:32.578 --> 23:37.500
I turned and saw that
he'd fallen into the river.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.087
The current was taking
him toward Vernal Falls.

23:43.005 --> 23:47.218
I was some distance back
and became paralyzed.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.808
and extended my walking stick to him,

23:53.850 --> 23:55.434
I might have saved him.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.733
just five days discharged from the Navy,

jumped in the river
and managed to grab Keen

24:05.153 --> 24:07.363
15 feet from the fall.

24:07.405 --> 24:11.325
The last I saw was his face

24:11.367 --> 24:14.078
as he went over the edge.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.914
The small crowd there screamed.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.918

24:22.795 --> 24:26.048
I jerked myself out
of my paralysis of fear

Freeman was never able to
do what he set out to do,

Chlorpromazine,

more commonly known as Thorazine,

29:58.631 --> 30:01.759
was introduced in America in 1954.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.347
Its effect on patients was immediate.

Psychiatrists were amazed.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.325
and greatly reduced
their hallucinations,

30:26.367 --> 30:29.286
delusions, and agitation,

30:29.328 --> 30:32.248
the major symptoms of schizophrenia.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.544
By the end of its first
year on the market,

30:36.585 --> 30:38.295
doctors had used Thorazine

30:38.337 --> 30:40.172
to treat more than 2 million patients.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.389
It might decrease the use of lobotomy,

30:48.430 --> 30:51.225
but I don't see it ever replacing it.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.143
They're calling it

30:53.185 --> 30:55.688
the psychological
equivalent of penicillin.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.147
It's a stopgap used

30:57.189 --> 30:58.857
to mask the symptoms of mental illness,

30:58.899 --> 31:00.109
not to heal them.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.485
It just shuts the patients up

31:01.527 --> 31:02.653
while others nurse them.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.367
Walt, that's...

31:08.409 --> 31:11.161
that's word for word what Nolan said

31:11.203 --> 31:13.622
when we demonstrated
transorbital lobotomy.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.421
Look,

31:20.462 --> 31:21.964
I think...

31:24.383 --> 31:30.055
we should use the release
of this drug as cause...

31:30.097 --> 31:31.974
as the reason...

31:35.769 --> 31:37.479
to call it a day.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.111
Look, I've been given a heads up.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.990
[SIGH] Greenblatt and Solomon.

31:48.032 --> 31:50.284
They've just edited a report

31:50.326 --> 31:52.786
on the long-term effects
of lobotomy... its...

31:56.040 --> 32:00.169
"permanent inability
to inhibit impulses,

32:00.210 --> 32:02.755
"its unnatural tranquility

32:02.796 --> 32:05.466
with undesirable shallowness
and absence of feeling."

32:08.886 --> 32:10.512
[RATTLING]

32:13.223 --> 32:16.894
Christmas cards from
my lobotomized patients.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.188
How many other doctors
get Christmas cards?

32:19.229 --> 32:20.981
Do you think anyone is going to send

32:21.023 --> 32:23.067
the makers of Thorazine
a Christmas card?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.985
I changed lives!

32:35.371 --> 32:36.497
[SCOFF]

32:37.581 --> 32:38.624
Look at that.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.045
Did you really change lives, Walt?

32:51.345 --> 32:52.680
[DOOR CLOSES]

33:09.988 --> 33:11.323
[THUNDER]

33:14.576 --> 33:19.164
It's easy to think of him
as a monster, an egomaniac

33:19.206 --> 33:21.542
who abused his patients' trust.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.422
And he was all of those things.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.132
But at the same time,

33:28.173 --> 33:30.008
he really did want to make a difference

33:30.050 --> 33:32.678
in the lives of the people
who came to him for help.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.142
WOMAN: He only gets worse.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.018
He refuses to change.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.937
You think he'd think what's best

33:41.979 --> 33:43.814
for the family first, for others,

33:43.856 --> 33:48.068
but he's destructive to me
and my husband and himself.

33:48.110 --> 33:54.324
and he will not... he refuses to see it.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.410
He thinks he's better
than everyone else.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.245
We've tried everything, and...

33:59.913 --> 34:01.999
it's in your hands now.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.168
Hmm.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.755
"He does not react to
either love or punishment

34:07.796 --> 34:10.257
and seems to do a lot of daydreaming."

34:12.717 --> 34:14.803
Me, too.

34:14.844 --> 34:19.183
"And when asked about it,
he says 'I don't know'.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.851
"Charles turns room lights on

34:21.893 --> 34:23.978
when there's broad sunlight outside."

34:25.688 --> 34:27.608
Hmm.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.860
Okay, then.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.862
Any questions about the procedure?

34:33.947 --> 34:35.699
All right.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.284
There's a coffee shop across the street.

34:38.327 --> 34:42.623
Why don't you come back
in, say, about an hour?

34:43.831 --> 34:44.875
All right.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.216
Okay, Charlie.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.969
Jump on up.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.315
Go ahead and pop that in for me.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.903
I'm just gonna lay you down gently.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.196
Head on the pillow.

35:15.656 --> 35:16.990
Perfect.

35:35.217 --> 35:38.011
[ELECTRICITY HUMMING]

35:43.475 --> 35:45.018
[MACHINE POWERS DOWN]

35:46.144 --> 35:48.355
[RAPID BREATHING]

36:02.619 --> 36:06.790
In 1967, the medical board
finally banned Walter Freeman

36:06.832 --> 36:08.667
from performing lobotomies.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.964
In 1968, he hit the road again,

36:14.006 --> 36:17.843
but this time, his
mission was different.

36:17.885 --> 36:21.305
Freeman crossed the country
to visit his former patients.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.932
He wanted to see what
their lives were like,

36:23.974 --> 36:25.851
if he had truly been the savior

36:25.893 --> 36:28.896
that he so desperately wanted to be.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.481
Maybe he was looking for the one thing

36:31.523 --> 36:34.860
his lobotomized patients
couldn't give him:

36:34.902 --> 36:36.111
redemption.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.908
Marjorie Freeman died in 1970,

36:40.949 --> 36:44.828
but, really, her life ended
the day her son passed away.

36:47.664 --> 36:51.001
Walter Freeman died of
cancer two years later.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.295
He's buried beside his wife and son.

36:55.255 --> 36:58.383
There is a hole near
the top of his tombstone,

36:58.425 --> 37:03.180
as if it had been punctured
with a large ice pick.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.681
When I first saw it,

37:04.723 --> 37:06.183
I thought of it as a hole

37:06.224 --> 37:08.727
in a life of unfulfilled dreams.

37:08.769 --> 37:12.314
But then again, maybe
I'm overthinking it.

37:12.356 --> 37:15.233
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

37:15.275 --> 37:19.029
After all, lore has a
way of doing that to you.
