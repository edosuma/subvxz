WEBVTT

00:03.230 --> 00:05.034
Previously on Future Man...

00:05.059 --> 00:06.149
It's the Cameronium.

00:06.150 --> 00:07.590
It scrambled our bodies in the jump.

00:07.614 --> 00:09.235
People fucking love me here.

00:09.236 --> 00:10.486
I've got "it."

00:10.487 --> 00:11.987
And what am I asked to do?

00:11.988 --> 00:13.072
Blow shit up.

00:13.073 --> 00:14.114
I was in love once.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.659
- Marigold?
- No, sweet Leslie.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.285
What kind of heroes are we gonna be?

00:18.286 --> 00:20.120
The kind who save the
world by killing a baby

00:20.121 --> 00:21.455
or the kind that save the world

00:21.456 --> 00:23.496
by sending a man down a
path towards a better life?

00:23.520 --> 00:24.437
What have you done?

00:24.462 --> 00:26.418
There's a boat leaving tonight

00:26.419 --> 00:29.172
and we're gonna make sure
Elias Kronish is on it.

00:32.049 --> 00:33.175
Trust me, okay?

00:33.176 --> 00:35.844
This day was the turning
point in Kronish's life.

00:35.845 --> 00:37.179
Okay, he was gonna give it all up

00:37.180 --> 00:39.223
and sail away with his
one true love, Leslie,

00:39.224 --> 00:41.016
but instead he stayed here with his wife

00:41.017 --> 00:42.142
and kept doing his research.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.863
It's his biggest regret
in his entire life.

00:43.887 --> 00:46.188
Wolf, get over here and
help me stand on his chest!

00:46.189 --> 00:47.989
You said if there was a
way to save the world

00:48.013 --> 00:49.942
without sacrificing any
more lives, you'd do it.

00:49.943 --> 00:52.194
This is a way.

00:52.195 --> 00:53.779
How would we get him on that boat?

00:53.780 --> 00:54.935
That part's easy, okay?

00:54.960 --> 00:56.200
- It's fine.
- You always say that

00:56.224 --> 00:58.325
before launching into a
needlessly complicated plan.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.368
We already know that Kronish is having

00:59.369 --> 01:00.369
an affair with Leslie.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.954
So all we have to do is expose that...

01:01.955 --> 01:03.355
- Difficult.
- Which will blow up

01:03.356 --> 01:04.596
- his marriage...
- Speculative.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.542
Which was bad anyways
because Marigold

01:06.543 --> 01:07.543
was already cheating on him too...

01:07.544 --> 01:08.669
- Hearsay.
- Which would give him

01:08.670 --> 01:10.030
the little push he needs to leave.

01:10.054 --> 01:11.338
It's a winwin for everybody.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.673
- Too slow.
- It's gonna work.

01:12.674 --> 01:13.737
Trust me, all right?

01:13.762 --> 01:15.512
We go back to 2017 to a world

01:15.537 --> 01:17.455
where Kronish Lab doesn't even exist.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.557
And if it does, there's always
a baby to kill in 1949.

01:21.558 --> 01:23.267
If you time trick us again,

01:23.268 --> 01:26.061
I'll burst your nut sack.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.354
Okay.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.024
All right, okay.

01:30.025 --> 01:31.567
Wolf, we need some wheels.

01:31.568 --> 01:33.248
I'll get you a
hundred fucking wheels.

01:33.272 --> 01:35.571
No, four, on a car,

01:35.572 --> 01:36.614
we just need a car.

01:36.615 --> 01:38.073
- I'm on it.
- And, Tiger,

01:38.074 --> 01:39.950
we got some shopping to do.

01:45.415 --> 01:47.916
I was licking that.

01:49.085 --> 01:51.712
Let me see if I understand
this Fatal Attraction thing.

01:51.713 --> 01:53.505
I'm psychomistress Glenn Close...

01:53.506 --> 01:54.631
AKA Leslie.

01:54.632 --> 01:57.426
Having pleasure sex
with married man Kronish,

01:57.427 --> 01:58.427
Michael Douglas.

01:58.428 --> 01:59.762
Yes, exactly.

01:59.763 --> 02:01.430
Now all we have to do is get you inside,

02:01.431 --> 02:03.515
take some sexy photos of
you on Kronish's bed,

02:03.516 --> 02:05.351
leave it there for his wife to find,

02:05.352 --> 02:07.603
affair exposed, marriage
over, future saved.

02:07.604 --> 02:10.064
Or... we put a gun to his head

02:10.065 --> 02:11.607
and make him get on the boat.

02:11.608 --> 02:13.525
No, no, no, no, no, we can't force him,

02:13.526 --> 02:17.279
it has to be his own
decision, free will, okay?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.115
Now, put on these assless chaps.

02:20.116 --> 02:21.605
All right.

02:29.709 --> 02:31.627
Wolf, what is this?

02:31.628 --> 02:34.338
1985 Pontiac Fiero GT.

02:34.339 --> 02:38.008
2.8 liter V6, 140 horsepower,

02:38.009 --> 02:39.802
and four fucking wheels.

02:39.803 --> 02:41.470
And two fucking seats.

02:41.471 --> 02:43.390
Where am I supposed to go?

02:44.474 --> 02:46.684
Jesus Christ!

02:46.685 --> 02:48.143
This car is useless.

02:48.144 --> 02:49.704
We'd be better off attaching electrodes

02:49.728 --> 02:50.793
to a sewer clown's nuts,

02:50.818 --> 02:52.578
jumping on his back, and
telling him to run.

02:52.602 --> 02:54.104
What do you want, a sedan?

02:54.129 --> 02:55.151
A fucking minivan?

02:55.152 --> 02:56.652
We're gonna look lame.

02:56.653 --> 02:57.820
I'll make you lame

02:57.821 --> 02:59.655
if you don't return this car.

02:59.656 --> 03:02.449
That's an order.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.284
Yeah, and return the guy,

03:04.285 --> 03:06.538
the guy in the trunk, please.

03:08.039 --> 03:10.583
Can a sewer clown do this?

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.677 --> 03:23.679
Boom, that's our way in.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.560
Wolf was supposed to be
here three fingers ago,

03:25.584 --> 03:27.224
he's never late!

03:27.225 --> 03:28.642
Maybe he got lost.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.310
Resistance soldiers don't ever get lost.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.520
We're born trackers.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.401
He could sniff out a
sludge grub in a blood bog

03:33.425 --> 03:35.524
20 kilometers away.

03:35.525 --> 03:36.650
It's gotta be the Biotics.

03:36.651 --> 03:37.776
There's Biotics here?

03:37.777 --> 03:39.653
Yeah, after all our dicking
around in history,

03:39.654 --> 03:41.494
they probably put deep
cover guards on Kronish

03:41.518 --> 03:42.936
at every point in his life.

03:49.831 --> 03:51.039
Hey.

03:53.001 --> 03:54.376
Tight wheels.

03:59.007 --> 04:00.215
Shit.

04:00.216 --> 04:01.800
He has the TTD.

04:01.801 --> 04:03.135
They're gonna be tracking that.

04:03.136 --> 04:04.344
I gotta go find Wolf.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.638
- But this is our only shot.
- You planned this op,

04:06.639 --> 04:07.806
said yourself it was gonna be simple,

04:07.807 --> 04:09.447
so you're gonna have
to pull it off solo.

04:09.471 --> 04:10.516
- But...
- You can do this.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.186
You've come a long way.

04:12.187 --> 04:15.147
Now put on these assless chaps.

04:15.148 --> 04:16.524
Saddle up, Big Poppa.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.122
Fate of the world.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.251
God damn it, Tiger.

04:41.067 --> 04:43.387
Do this go on my neck or where?

05:22.257 --> 05:23.298
Hey!

05:23.299 --> 05:25.092
I'm tracking here!

05:25.093 --> 05:26.677
I'm tracking!

05:28.471 --> 05:30.138
Where are you, Wolf?

06:12.307 --> 06:14.683
You want some of that?

06:45.548 --> 06:47.507
Hey, Corey, where you going?

06:47.508 --> 06:50.886
I got some things to take care of.

06:50.887 --> 06:53.722
Come on, man, just one more game.

06:53.723 --> 06:55.308
For me?

06:59.062 --> 07:00.187
One more.

07:00.188 --> 07:02.064
For you, Blaze.

07:05.068 --> 07:07.611
Too much dick.

07:07.612 --> 07:09.529
A little too much hair.

07:10.740 --> 07:12.352
That's pretty ladylike.

07:12.377 --> 07:13.409
Yeah.

07:13.410 --> 07:14.451
That's a woman.

07:14.452 --> 07:15.619
Perfect.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.039
Let's just seal these up
with a kiss for Marigold.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.918
Not complicated at all.

07:22.919 --> 07:24.753
Well, my husband is

07:24.754 --> 07:25.834
coming home in a few hours,

07:25.858 --> 07:28.924
so we don't have much time.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.094
Yes, come over now.

07:32.095 --> 07:34.096
She is having an affair.

07:34.097 --> 07:35.555
This is even better than my plan.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.890
I'm running out to get champagne,

07:36.891 --> 07:38.642
so you let yourself in.

07:38.643 --> 07:40.519
Wear something sexy.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.146
All right, girl, you can do this.
Come on, now.

07:56.869 --> 07:59.121
Coming in.

07:59.122 --> 08:01.289
I love the '80s!

08:01.290 --> 08:03.500
Yeah, you stuck around
for the best, bro.

08:03.501 --> 08:05.585
Right, bro.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.129
Who we bashing?

08:07.130 --> 08:08.213
Good one.

08:08.214 --> 08:09.798
Remember Chase's dog, Zog?

08:09.799 --> 08:11.842
Just booked a crazy beer commercial.

08:11.843 --> 08:13.260
National campaign.

08:13.261 --> 08:16.173
Hey, Zog, send a couple
cold ones this way.

08:31.195 --> 08:32.827
Is this dog a slave?

08:32.852 --> 08:33.865
Are you kidding?

08:33.866 --> 08:34.990
After his commercials air,

08:34.991 --> 08:36.825
we're all gonna be working for him.

08:37.994 --> 08:39.828
Someone forgot the charcoal.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.328
We got no flame for the 'cue!

08:41.330 --> 08:43.832
- Aw, no!
- And the meat!

08:43.832 --> 08:46.918
Who spaced on the meat?

08:46.919 --> 08:48.462
It was me.

08:49.672 --> 08:52.299
Flame, flesh.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.969
Leave that to me, bros.

08:55.970 --> 08:59.181
Dr. Kronish is already on his way home?

08:59.182 --> 09:00.223
He's sick?

09:00.224 --> 09:01.850
That's wonderful news, thank you.

09:03.936 --> 09:07.189
Marigold's lover.

09:07.190 --> 09:09.566
Piece of cake.

09:11.319 --> 09:12.360
Shit, the bag.

10:11.087 --> 10:13.088
Elias.

10:13.089 --> 10:15.465
What are you doing here?

10:18.352 --> 10:19.387
It's happening!

10:19.388 --> 10:21.388
They're squaring up.

10:32.358 --> 10:34.442
Leslie, I've missed you.

10:34.443 --> 10:35.986
Now this is complicated.

10:43.452 --> 10:45.120
Corey, you're amazing!

10:45.121 --> 10:46.371
You saved the party.

10:47.623 --> 10:48.863
I like to party.

10:48.888 --> 10:49.959
Yeah!

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
Let's hear it for the 'cuemeister!

11:05.141 --> 11:07.893
That's Wolf's foot.

11:07.894 --> 11:09.270
My little toe.

11:11.439 --> 11:13.148
A battle took place here.

11:13.149 --> 11:16.693
A skull hit the ground there.

11:16.694 --> 11:17.862
There.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.614
There.

11:20.615 --> 11:22.991
So many skulls.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.743
Wolf.

11:24.744 --> 11:26.745
Wolfie, what happened to you?

11:39.467 --> 11:41.636
Not now. Go, go!

11:45.139 --> 11:49.893
No. Come on.

11:49.894 --> 11:52.187
No, no, no. Come on, you're okay.

11:52.188 --> 11:53.563
You're okay.

11:57.735 --> 11:59.903
Party's over.

11:59.904 --> 12:01.112
Who felled that tree?

12:01.113 --> 12:02.822
I don't know what that means

12:02.823 --> 12:04.699
but 9 times out of 10

12:04.700 --> 12:07.452
the answer is Corey Wolfhart.

12:07.453 --> 12:09.746
Let me guess, he was drinking

12:09.747 --> 12:13.291
this frothy piss water,

12:13.292 --> 12:15.752
just scavenging for blowjobs.

12:15.753 --> 12:17.087
Yeah, that's Corey.

12:17.088 --> 12:19.798
He is king of the public beach.

12:19.799 --> 12:21.925
He doesn't care if there
are families around

12:21.926 --> 12:23.301
or nothing.

12:23.302 --> 12:24.386
What's your deal?

12:24.387 --> 12:25.387
Your clothes say party

12:25.388 --> 12:27.264
but your face says pooper.

12:27.265 --> 12:29.891
You think I want a pooping face?

12:29.892 --> 12:31.351
I thought he was dead

12:31.352 --> 12:33.603
but he went AWOL just to have fun?

12:33.604 --> 12:35.897
Well, it sounds to me like
you're worrying too much

12:35.898 --> 12:37.941
about the fun he's having

12:37.942 --> 12:42.779
and maybe not enough about
the fun you're not having.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.824
Frothy piss water?

12:48.637 --> 12:50.585
I'm close, I'm close!

12:50.610 --> 12:51.664
I'm...

12:55.960 --> 12:58.044
Finally.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.673
And now, your turn.

13:01.841 --> 13:03.509
Are you kidding me?

13:06.554 --> 13:10.265
Everyone thinks I'm just this
old rockhearted taskbot

13:10.266 --> 13:12.017
but I wanna have fun too.

13:12.018 --> 13:13.560
- Yup.
- You know?

13:13.561 --> 13:15.103
I wanna...

13:15.104 --> 13:17.314
I wanna lick some party toads,

13:17.315 --> 13:18.481
go to Paris,

13:18.482 --> 13:20.066
see the Eiffel Hole,

13:20.067 --> 13:21.109
shower...

13:23.612 --> 13:24.863
I love to shower.

13:24.864 --> 13:26.197
Do my dance.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.449
I wanna do my dance.

13:27.450 --> 13:29.784
Heck yeah!

13:29.785 --> 13:30.786
Whoa!

13:32.621 --> 13:33.788
Whoa!

13:33.789 --> 13:35.665
Got it, you got it.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.375
Wow, that's cool.

13:37.376 --> 13:39.127
You are fun.

13:39.128 --> 13:40.462
Yeah, that's...

13:40.463 --> 13:41.703
that's what Wolfie doesn't get.

13:41.727 --> 13:44.507
He doesn't get that I can't cut loose.

13:44.508 --> 13:45.925
I can't cut loose.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.719
Not with a world to save.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.920
I should have put him on one
of those ownership chains.

13:49.944 --> 13:52.015
No, no, no, see, that's
where you're wrong.

13:52.016 --> 13:53.641
I let Zog off this leash,

13:53.642 --> 13:56.311
he ran off, came back
with a doggie agent

13:56.312 --> 13:58.271
and a fourcommercial deal.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.273
You gotta let him lap the park,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.400
blow off some steam
every once in a while.

14:02.401 --> 14:03.443
He will come back

14:03.444 --> 14:06.112
because you have a bond
of trust and respect

14:06.113 --> 14:10.575
and that is more important than any...

14:10.576 --> 14:12.744
ownership chain.

14:12.745 --> 14:15.413
You're right, he will come back to me.

14:15.414 --> 14:19.000
I'm gonna let Wolf lap the park.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.460
Yeah.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.379
Thank you, bench oracle.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.714
Now I gotta go help a little man

14:24.715 --> 14:26.509
in some assless chaps.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.096
Your dog.

14:31.097 --> 14:32.680
He's dead.

14:32.681 --> 14:34.307
You ate him.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.101
Yeah, right.

14:42.024 --> 14:45.860
Leslie, can I ask you a
very serious question?

14:47.404 --> 14:49.030
Were you...

14:49.031 --> 14:50.698
meowing?

14:50.699 --> 14:52.450
I thought that was you meowing!

14:52.451 --> 14:53.492
No!

14:53.517 --> 14:54.869
Must have been my neighbor's cat,

14:54.870 --> 14:56.190
always coming through the window.

14:56.214 --> 14:58.957
I can't blame him, I can't
stay away from you either.

14:58.958 --> 15:02.086
Well, good, I wouldn't want you to.

15:07.007 --> 15:11.845
Ever since the 8th grade,

15:11.846 --> 15:15.390
I knew who I really was.

15:15.391 --> 15:18.977
I was just too afraid to act on it

15:18.978 --> 15:20.220
till I met you.

15:21.273 --> 15:22.313
And you know what?

15:22.314 --> 15:23.731
Holding each other,

15:23.732 --> 15:25.358
that's the best part.

15:27.653 --> 15:30.488
How did Marigold take the news?

15:30.489 --> 15:32.240
Well, um...

15:32.241 --> 15:34.284
You haven't told her?

15:34.285 --> 15:37.203
I'm going to, I'm packed and everything.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.580
This is the hardest part.

15:38.581 --> 15:39.861
I'm thinking of Dear Johning it.

15:39.885 --> 15:42.115
No, no, no, you have to
tell it to her face.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.169
You owe her that much.

15:43.194 --> 15:44.554
- Elias, you home?
- It's Marigold!

15:44.578 --> 15:45.503
Shit!

15:45.504 --> 15:46.963
Hey, honey!

15:46.964 --> 15:48.344
Are you having doubts?

15:48.369 --> 15:49.466
Tell her!

15:49.467 --> 15:53.094
- I just came home early!
- I wanna hear it.

15:53.095 --> 15:54.335
I'll be here for moral support.

15:54.359 --> 15:55.638
I'll hide underneath the bed

15:55.639 --> 15:56.639
or in the closet.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.057
That's ridiculous.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.601
Out the window.

15:59.602 --> 16:01.002
I'll see you at the marina tonight?

16:01.026 --> 16:02.187
Of course.

16:11.363 --> 16:12.947
Why did you come home?

16:12.948 --> 16:15.116
The truth is, Marigold,

16:15.117 --> 16:16.951
I...

16:16.952 --> 16:19.412
decided to give myself a birthday treat

16:19.413 --> 16:20.622
and come home early

16:20.623 --> 16:23.291
so I could curl up with
that mystery I'm reading.

16:23.292 --> 16:24.709
Why are you so sweaty?

16:24.710 --> 16:26.294
That's just my heart racing

16:26.295 --> 16:27.587
trying to determine who done it.

16:27.588 --> 16:30.924
Okay, all right, well, I
have a surprise for you.

16:30.925 --> 16:32.467
But I don't want you ruining it.

16:32.468 --> 16:34.761
So, you are going to get back there,

16:34.762 --> 16:36.012
you are going to run me

16:36.013 --> 16:39.766
the hottest, nicest bath
you can think of, okay?

16:39.767 --> 16:41.100
You're gonna add the bubble

16:41.101 --> 16:43.436
and a little bit of Epsom
salt with that "genete."

16:43.437 --> 16:46.439
'cause my hip hurts but
Mama's feeling fancy.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.982
Okay, baby?

16:52.238 --> 16:53.321
You are here.

16:53.322 --> 16:54.489
I'm freaking out!

16:54.490 --> 16:55.698
My husband came home early.

16:55.699 --> 16:57.992
Marigold's lover.

16:57.993 --> 16:58.993
What?

17:00.066 --> 17:02.330
- I am Glenn Close.
- Is she drunk?

17:02.331 --> 17:04.290
Your husband is attracted to me.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.291
Fatally.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.752
Jesus Christ!

17:18.681 --> 17:21.516
Where did I put that passport?

17:21.517 --> 17:23.436
I'm here to have pleasure
sex with your husband.

17:23.461 --> 17:25.185
I hope so, that's what
I'm paying you for.

17:25.186 --> 17:26.729
Wait here, I'm gonna get Elias.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.940
So you can confront him,
about his betrayal?

17:28.941 --> 17:31.526
No, so you can fuck him
while I go take a bath.

17:31.527 --> 17:33.278
You're not supposed to take a bath.

17:33.279 --> 17:34.529
You're supposed to break down.

17:34.530 --> 17:35.863
Listen, honey,

17:35.864 --> 17:37.240
I know our marriage is in trouble

17:37.241 --> 17:38.700
but I am not about to become

17:38.701 --> 17:40.451
one of those sad divorcées

17:40.452 --> 17:42.495
that the ladies at church gossip about

17:42.496 --> 17:44.372
and those bitches talk.

17:46.292 --> 17:48.042
You love Leslie, you love him,

17:48.043 --> 17:49.877
you're going, find the passport.

17:49.878 --> 17:51.504
I don't wanna have sex with him

17:51.505 --> 17:53.965
and he definitely doesn't
wanna have sex with me.

17:53.966 --> 17:54.966
That is where you,

17:54.967 --> 17:57.051
a birthday prostitute, come in.

17:57.052 --> 17:58.720
Okay, so you're just gonna let Kronish

17:58.721 --> 18:00.388
just lap the park,

18:00.389 --> 18:01.723
blow off some steam.

18:01.724 --> 18:03.884
Just set him free and know
that he'll come back to you

18:03.908 --> 18:05.727
based on your bond of trust and respect.

18:05.728 --> 18:08.229
What are you talking
about, "set him free"?

18:08.230 --> 18:10.440
This is about control.

18:10.441 --> 18:12.191
Who he fucks, when he fucks,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.778
what he fucks, I'm in charge.

18:15.779 --> 18:17.071
You are incredible.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.072
Damn right.

18:18.073 --> 18:19.782
You don't give a drifter freedom.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.326
You'll never see him again.

18:21.327 --> 18:23.244
You remind him that
you're the one in charge,

18:23.245 --> 18:24.605
that he signed up for this mission

18:24.629 --> 18:27.029
and whether he likes it or not,
you're both in this together

18:27.053 --> 18:28.042
till death.

18:28.043 --> 18:29.751
Yes, that is marriage.

18:29.752 --> 18:31.669
You can't give up on it.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.505
- Never surrender.
- Never surrender.

18:35.758 --> 18:37.216
Never surrender.

18:39.011 --> 18:41.763
Thank you, cunning wife oracle.

18:41.764 --> 18:42.964
All right, from this point on,

18:42.988 --> 18:44.265
less talking, more fucking.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.601
Speaking of, he never gets fully hard

18:46.602 --> 18:48.186
so you might have to roll it on up

18:48.187 --> 18:49.646
and cram it in there.

18:49.647 --> 18:52.231
But you look like you
know what you're doing.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.399
Good luck.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.567
Copy that.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.777
Roll and cram.

19:05.454 --> 19:07.080
Tiger.

19:07.081 --> 19:08.164
Tiger!

19:11.460 --> 19:12.627
Tiger!

19:14.630 --> 19:15.797
A Biotic.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.802
- This is a detonator.
- Really?

19:20.803 --> 19:22.261
That's what we're doing?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.295
Don't move.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.347
You take one more step,

19:24.348 --> 19:25.765
I press this button, the
whole house is wired,

19:25.766 --> 19:27.926
it blows up, we all die, and
your mission's a failure.

19:27.950 --> 19:29.769
You wanna test me, you
wanna fucking test me?

19:29.770 --> 19:31.437
I'll die right now, I'm loco!

19:31.438 --> 19:33.398
Okay, you're in charge.

19:33.399 --> 19:35.924
I guess I'm your hostage now.

19:35.949 --> 19:37.027
Yeah.

19:37.028 --> 19:38.569
Yeah, yeah, you're my hostage.

19:38.570 --> 19:41.989
I suppose you wanna tie
me up or something.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.991
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea.

19:43.992 --> 19:45.910
Go, go in there to the right, go.

19:47.246 --> 19:49.956
Don't do anything stupid.

19:49.957 --> 19:51.283
Handcuffs are gonna cost ya.

19:51.308 --> 19:52.376
Don't threaten me, okay?

19:52.377 --> 19:53.668
This isn't my first time.

19:53.669 --> 19:56.504
Okay, yeah, I forgot,
you're in complete control.

19:56.505 --> 19:59.132
You getting it all hot
and steamy for me, baby?

19:59.133 --> 20:00.133
Yes.

20:00.134 --> 20:01.694
But we haven't taken a bath together...

20:01.718 --> 20:02.885
No, the bath is for me.

20:02.886 --> 20:04.387
Your surprise is in the living room.

20:04.388 --> 20:06.723
Let's just say I know
what you've been missing

20:06.724 --> 20:08.558
and in order to keep
our marriage working,

20:08.559 --> 20:10.184
I'm willing to make allowances.

20:10.185 --> 20:13.062
Go, thank you.

20:16.024 --> 20:17.150
Tiger!

20:17.151 --> 20:19.485
Tiger, there's a Biotic.

20:20.738 --> 20:22.697
Tiger!

20:22.698 --> 20:25.199
- Tiger, there's a...
- Leslie, is that you?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.993
I told you to go out the window!

20:33.876 --> 20:34.876
Leslie!

20:37.212 --> 20:38.463
Marigold's in the bath.

20:38.464 --> 20:39.714
Come out!

20:43.510 --> 20:45.052
Good Lord.

20:48.098 --> 20:50.184
Happy birthday.

20:55.773 --> 20:57.940
My God.

20:57.941 --> 21:00.234
You're my birthday surprise?

21:02.571 --> 21:05.156
- She knows.
- She knows?

21:05.157 --> 21:06.741
You're a gigolo, aren't you?

21:09.745 --> 21:11.037
- Yes.
- Marigold clearly

21:11.038 --> 21:13.414
doesn't know what kind of
men I find attractive.

21:13.415 --> 21:16.709
But I can't believe she was
willing to hire a prostitute.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.044
The Biotic's a prostitute.

21:18.045 --> 21:20.213
If she's willing to make
this kind of accommodation,

21:20.214 --> 21:22.048
maybe this marriage will work after all.

21:22.049 --> 21:23.674
What? No, no, no, no.

21:23.675 --> 21:24.801
You have to leave her.

21:24.802 --> 21:26.552
I don't remember asking you.

21:26.553 --> 21:30.097
Look, truth is, I've been gigoloing...

21:30.098 --> 21:32.266
gigolo... gigoing...

21:32.267 --> 21:34.352
fucking dudes for money for a while now.

21:34.353 --> 21:37.104
This is not the first time
that a wife has hired me

21:37.105 --> 21:38.272
to try to save her marriage,

21:38.273 --> 21:39.774
and trust me, it never works.

21:39.775 --> 21:40.775
- Never.
- Yeah, well,

21:40.776 --> 21:41.901
maybe that's on you.

21:43.111 --> 21:44.487
You see this?

21:44.488 --> 21:46.364
I'm the fucking best, okay?

21:47.783 --> 21:49.116
Listen to me.

21:49.117 --> 21:53.538
You are in love with someone else.

21:53.539 --> 21:56.791
Someone who you have crazy, passionate,

21:56.792 --> 22:00.169
vibrant sex with for very
long periods of time.

22:00.170 --> 22:02.755
But, most importantly,

22:02.756 --> 22:07.593
you found someone who
you truly love to hold.

22:07.594 --> 22:11.138
Someone who sees you for
who you really are.

22:12.391 --> 22:13.891
This marriage that you're in,

22:13.892 --> 22:16.561
it's nothing more than an anchor

22:16.562 --> 22:18.062
holding you down

22:18.063 --> 22:22.525
when really, you need to set sail.

22:24.486 --> 22:26.487
Metaphorically speaking.

22:26.488 --> 22:28.990
Damn, you're one perceptive hooker.

22:28.991 --> 22:31.158
- The best.
- But you know what?

22:31.159 --> 22:32.285
- You're right.
- I'm right?

22:32.286 --> 22:34.161
- Yes, I should set sail.
- Absolutely!

22:34.162 --> 22:35.830
- I can do this.
- You can!

22:35.831 --> 22:37.623
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.418
What do I owe you?

22:40.419 --> 22:42.063
- Fifty bucks.
- Take sixty.

22:42.088 --> 22:43.088
Okay.

22:43.089 --> 22:45.131
- You earned it.
- Thank you very much.

22:45.132 --> 22:47.341
- Set sail.
- Set sail.

22:54.516 --> 22:55.683
Hey, Jimmy.

22:55.684 --> 22:57.268
- What's up, Elias?
- Hi.

22:57.269 --> 22:58.436
Hey, I think my cat might have

22:58.437 --> 22:59.797
climbed through your window again.

22:59.798 --> 23:00.918
Mind if I take a quick look?

23:00.942 --> 23:02.064
Well, well, you know,

23:02.065 --> 23:04.191
I don't think now is really a good time.

23:04.192 --> 23:06.861
I'm actually sort of in
the middle of something.

23:18.123 --> 23:20.499
I have gotta get you out of here, okay?

23:20.500 --> 23:23.252
Are you the good guy now?

23:23.253 --> 23:25.588
I'm trying to be.

23:25.589 --> 23:28.549
Look, if the wrong person
sees you right now,

23:28.550 --> 23:31.218
it's gonna undo a whole lot
of progress I just made.

23:31.219 --> 23:33.137
Okay, well, I'm not going anywhere

23:33.138 --> 23:34.347
until I get paid.

23:34.348 --> 23:36.265
Okay, I got 60 bucks.

23:36.266 --> 23:37.475
Sixty bucks?

23:37.476 --> 23:40.019
This isn't a rest stop glory hole.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.562
I'm calling Big Lou.

23:41.563 --> 23:43.283
No, no, no, no, please,
don't call Big Lou.

23:43.284 --> 23:44.404
The last thing we need to do

23:44.428 --> 23:46.359
is add more people to this right now.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.444
All right, I'll get you more money.

23:48.445 --> 23:50.529
Okay, I'll take a TaB too.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.864
What the fuck's a TaB?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.748
- Reverend Leslie?
- Marigold!

24:00.749 --> 24:03.876
I just came to offer
Elias a birthday prayer

24:03.877 --> 24:06.504
which I just did in my head.

24:06.505 --> 24:08.881
- So, I'm gonna see myself out.
- Okay.

24:10.425 --> 24:14.086
Um... Hello, where's my money?

24:15.961 --> 24:16.974
Now if you'll excuse me,

24:16.975 --> 24:18.391
I really have to talk to my wife.

24:18.392 --> 24:19.672
Man, make sure you call me, man.

24:19.696 --> 24:20.810
I will!

24:28.026 --> 24:30.001
You ain't gonna call me.

24:30.026 --> 24:31.192
Come on, you're a good woman.

24:31.217 --> 24:32.239
You gotta get so...

24:32.240 --> 24:33.864
Come on, this profession isn't for you.

24:33.865 --> 24:35.241
Where are you at?

24:38.412 --> 24:41.372
Yeah, you in here, I know you in here.

24:41.373 --> 24:43.124
No, Big Lou!

24:43.125 --> 24:45.042
There's some sensitive things
happening in the house.

24:45.043 --> 24:46.293
We gotta get you out of here.

24:46.294 --> 24:47.878
I'll tell you what's gonna be sensitive

24:47.879 --> 24:51.340
is my asshole after Big
Lou sticks his boot up it

24:51.341 --> 24:52.842
when I don't get him his money.

24:52.843 --> 24:54.552
Bunny, where the hell are you?

24:54.553 --> 24:56.679
No, you don't.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.847
What the hell, man?

24:57.848 --> 25:00.304
- Is Bunny in there?
- Yeah, but you're not getting her back.

25:00.305 --> 25:01.892
- Why not?
- Because she's not yours,

25:01.893 --> 25:03.185
you sick son of a bitch.

25:03.186 --> 25:04.937
She's not mine?

25:04.938 --> 25:06.689
Who do you think got
her out the shelter?

25:06.690 --> 25:09.050
Who do you think paid hundreds
of dollars to get her fixed?

25:09.074 --> 25:11.736
Who do you think cleans up
the box that she shits in?

25:11.737 --> 25:12.945
You monster!

25:18.243 --> 25:19.493
Now we dance.

25:19.494 --> 25:21.537
No, Big Lou, Big Lou, it's
okay, I have your money.

25:21.538 --> 25:22.955
Hey, that's my money.

25:22.956 --> 25:26.292
What the fuck is going on here?

25:26.293 --> 25:27.668
This asshole sucker punched me.

25:27.669 --> 25:29.336
This filthy pimp abuses this woman!

25:29.337 --> 25:32.131
- He's not my pimp.
- I'm a history teacher!

25:32.132 --> 25:33.132
You're a prostitute?

25:33.133 --> 25:35.009
No, no, he's the prostitute.

25:35.010 --> 25:37.261
No, neither one is the prostitute.

25:37.262 --> 25:39.055
Well, I'm a prostitute.

25:39.056 --> 25:40.639
Look, you're so much more than that.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.475
Shut the fuck up, priest.

25:42.476 --> 25:44.060
- You're a priest?
- I'm a reverend.

25:44.061 --> 25:45.821
Yeah, I don't care about
none of you freaks.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.146
I just want Bunny back!

25:47.147 --> 25:48.189
Hold on a second.

25:48.190 --> 25:50.983
You, you thought that
he was the prostitute.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.569
Why would I get you a male prostitute?

25:53.570 --> 25:56.697
Yes, why would she, Elias?

26:04.247 --> 26:05.873
I thought you wanted me

26:05.874 --> 26:07.875
to watch you have sex with him.

26:07.876 --> 26:10.711
I've shared with you my
cuckolding fantasy, haven't I?

26:10.712 --> 26:12.588
No.

26:12.589 --> 26:15.362
I thought you were trying
to tell me you were gay.

26:16.453 --> 26:17.511
Right.

26:17.512 --> 26:19.095
No, just cuckolding.

26:19.096 --> 26:22.265
Just your standard
runofthemill cuck...

26:24.768 --> 26:28.521
Obviously you two have
a lot to talk about.

26:28.522 --> 26:30.898
I gotta go.

26:30.899 --> 26:33.067
My boat still leaves at midnight.

26:33.068 --> 26:34.796
Ooh, what boat, what's he talking about?

26:34.821 --> 26:35.862
I have no idea.

26:35.863 --> 26:38.489
No, no, don't let him leave.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.658
Come on, be true to yourself.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.578
He's in love with someone else.

26:44.579 --> 26:46.080
Seriously, who is this guy?

26:46.081 --> 26:47.206
I haven't the foggiest.

26:47.207 --> 26:48.958
I never met him before in my life.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.421
Don't you act like you don't know

26:54.422 --> 26:56.549
exactly who I am, Elias.

26:56.550 --> 27:00.136
I will not let you treat
me like some slut

27:00.137 --> 27:01.470
you can just bang a couple times

27:01.471 --> 27:02.805
and then throw in the garbage.

27:02.806 --> 27:04.890
I don't know what this
man is talking about.

27:04.891 --> 27:08.435
You thought that you could
just come into my life

27:08.436 --> 27:10.146
and turn everything upside down

27:10.147 --> 27:11.856
and only think about yourself?

27:11.857 --> 27:16.694
You think that we can spend
an entire weekend making love

27:16.695 --> 27:18.779
and then you can just ignore me?

27:18.780 --> 27:20.865
Well, you got another thing coming

27:20.866 --> 27:21.866
because you know what?

27:21.867 --> 27:24.554
I will not be ignored, Elias.

27:24.579 --> 27:25.656
Proof.

27:25.681 --> 27:27.246
Look what he made me do.

27:27.247 --> 27:29.498
Well, what the fuck are
these supposed to prove?

27:29.499 --> 27:31.375
That's it, I'm calling the police.

27:31.376 --> 27:32.918
Give me a 90second head start?

27:32.919 --> 27:34.420
No!

27:34.421 --> 27:35.421
Bunny!

27:35.422 --> 27:38.674
Lord, no!

27:38.675 --> 27:40.426
My Bunny...

27:40.427 --> 27:41.510
my Bunny's dea...

27:41.511 --> 27:42.803
My Bunny's dead!

27:42.804 --> 27:44.722
The cat's name is Bunny?

27:44.723 --> 27:45.973
Ha.

27:45.974 --> 27:48.559
If I'd have known that, I would
have hid it someplace else.

27:54.024 --> 27:56.817
I'm just gonna get my bag and...

28:00.113 --> 28:02.573
Fuck free will, I should
have done the gun thing!

28:03.992 --> 28:06.744
I don't care if we go way back,

28:06.745 --> 28:09.288
I said the tickets are sold out!

28:11.249 --> 28:12.416
Are you Will Call?

28:12.417 --> 28:14.501
I'm supposed to ask you about a ticket.

28:14.502 --> 28:16.003
Name's Corey Wolfhart.

28:16.004 --> 28:17.880
The Corey Wolfhart?

28:17.881 --> 28:19.673
You run with Zog's crew, right?

28:19.674 --> 28:20.799
No.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.510
He runs in mine.

28:23.511 --> 28:25.095
Ran.

28:25.096 --> 28:26.306
Let me get your ticket.

28:27.849 --> 28:30.225
There it is, Corey Wolfhart.

28:30.226 --> 28:31.852
VIP special.

28:34.564 --> 28:37.983
Well, if it isn't the
king of the public beach.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.194
What took you so long?

28:40.195 --> 28:42.029
Your tracking skills are slipping.

28:42.030 --> 28:44.531
I consulted two oracles today.

28:44.532 --> 28:46.533
One said give you your freedom

28:46.534 --> 28:48.369
and you'll come back to me.

28:48.370 --> 28:51.705
He was dumb and ate his own dog.

28:51.706 --> 28:53.040
The other said rein you in

28:53.041 --> 28:55.501
with the illusion of freedom.

28:55.502 --> 28:57.378
She was impressive...

28:57.379 --> 28:59.046
but crazy.

28:59.047 --> 29:00.297
And then I realized,

29:00.298 --> 29:04.134
your freedom, it isn't
mine to give or take.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.262
Neither one of us is gonna be free

29:07.263 --> 29:09.515
until we finish what we started.

29:09.516 --> 29:11.350
You're wrong.

29:11.351 --> 29:12.810
I'm free now.

29:17.232 --> 29:19.942
Because I quit.
