00:06.548 --> 00:08.842
-Mr. Haller I presume.
-Judge Holder.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.011
<i>What's your relationship</i>
<i>with Jerry Vincent?</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:14.055
<i>He left you his practice.</i>
<i>Including the Trevor Elliott trial.</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:16.725
I will be monitoring you, Mr. Haller.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.977
-Need you to get a file for me.
-Which one?

00:19.060 --> 00:21.813
<i>Jesús Menendez.</i>
<i>He's doing 15 years for murder.</i>

00:21.896 --> 00:25.108
A witness disappeared on me.
Without her, he was looking at life.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.110
<i>At best, I had to plead him out.</i>

00:27.193 --> 00:31.823
Cherry, I'm here because I really need
your help finding Glory Days again.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.867
Glory was my
key witness in a murder trial.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.745
How you gonna talk
about your cases in a bugged car?

00:36.828 --> 00:38.204
You planted somebody.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.500
Aerospace engineer at Lockheed Martin.
I'm single and I live in Palos Verdes.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.129
-It's juror number seven?
-All I know is he's bought and paid for.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.673
You should look
into this one. Carol Dubois.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.091
The insurance lady?

00:50.175 --> 00:53.053
Alibi or no alibi,
there is something off about her.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.846
You want my client
to wear a wire?

00:54.929 --> 00:57.766
You wanna rebuild things?
You want me to trust you again?

00:57.849 --> 00:59.184
Then start by trusting me.

00:59.267 --> 01:03.313
-People think you killed that man.
-I did it to protect us and our baby.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.648
Soto, you're under arrest.
Get on the ground.

01:05.732 --> 01:10.195
<i>Got SIS on you. Surveillance</i>
<i>unit. You won't even know they're there.</i>

01:10.278 --> 01:13.907
I got some business for you.
Hard Case Casey.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.784
Call my office,
we'll figure something out.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.535
Say hi to Cisco for me.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.580
-Has the jury reached a verdict?
-We have.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.208
"We find the defendant not guilty."

01:25.376 --> 01:26.211
No.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.007
Those hundred lines of code
that changed everything. Lara wrote them.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.134
She was the genius, not you.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.886
I wanna know who's behind it.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.223
The bribe, killing Jerry,
having me followed.

01:38.306 --> 01:42.435
Jerry kept me out of the loop.
I have no idea who killed him.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.063
Frankly… I don't care.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.489
<i>We pulled over a woman</i>
<i>named Izzy Letts on suspicion of DUI.</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:57.408
Izzy!

02:01.079 --> 02:03.498
You should have
just gone along with it.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.302
You're a loose end, Haller.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.597
It's nothing personal.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.725
Just business.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.201
Get your hands up!

03:23.119 --> 03:23.995
Shit.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.252
Haller?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.047
We need backup.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.592
-You're all right. Come on.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.223
Where are you?
I've been calling you.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.642
<i>Sorry. My phone was off.</i>
<i>I'm at a meeting.</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:46.601
Everything okay?

03:46.684 --> 03:49.562
Yeah, it wasn't exactly
a straight line, but I got here.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.733
<i>We've located</i>
<i>the body. SR-53. Suspect is DOA.</i>

03:53.816 --> 03:55.235
Is everything okay with you?

03:55.985 --> 03:59.656
-Did something happen while I was offline?
-Uh, one or two things maybe.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.951
But I've got your favorite
bodyguards here with me.

04:03.034 --> 04:03.868
<i>What?</i>

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

04:05.453 --> 04:09.499
Listen, just take care of yourself,
all right? Be safe. Hang in there.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.085
-One day at a time, right?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

04:12.168 --> 04:13.544
Roger. Griggs out.

04:15.838 --> 04:16.756
You okay?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.217
I'll live.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.097
I guess, uh, I have to thank you.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.517
I still don't know what you're doing here.
Were you following me?

04:27.600 --> 04:32.146
I kept SIS on you after you said
you didn't think there was a bribe.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.942
-You still didn't trust me.
-You lied to me, Haller.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.319
-And you know it.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.697
You wanna tell me the truth now?

04:41.406 --> 04:43.658
Well, I can tell you
who killed Jerry Vincent.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.618
He's at the bottom of that cliff now.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.954
His name is McSweeney.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.041
He was on Trevor Elliott's jury,
pretending to be someone else.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.794
He was the bribe?

04:55.712 --> 04:59.590
Maybe. He went AWOL when the judge
got an anonymous note about him.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
-Anonymous?
-That's all I know.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.471
Are you sure your client
doesn't know anything more?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.726
Or are you telling me
this guy was behind it all?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.186
Right now, I'm not sure of anything. Okay?

05:12.270 --> 05:15.106
Well, somebody wants you dead, Counselor.

05:16.482 --> 05:21.529
So, if I were you,
I'd get sure before they try again.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.626
McSweeney? What about him?

05:35.710 --> 05:39.672
Dig deeper. His background, anything.
I gotta see how he's connected.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.632
-Connected to what?
-I don't know yet.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.844
He was a cog in the machine,
the machine's still out there.

05:44.927 --> 05:49.182
-Just find whatever you can.
-<i>And what about Glory Days?</i>

05:49.265 --> 05:52.643
-Shit. That's tomorrow--
-Mickey, you cannot handle this right now.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.022
I have to, Lorna. All right?
We have one shot at this.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.815
-And she's it.
-I'll go.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.568
-It'll go down better coming from me.
-<i>What will you say?</i>

06:00.651 --> 06:01.944
<i>Whatever I have to.</i>

06:02.028 --> 06:04.113
Just get some rest. I'll handle it.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.940
-You son of a bitch.
-Whoa!

06:39.023 --> 06:41.317
-What were you thinking?
-What you talkin' about?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.194
Why are you going after some killer?

06:43.277 --> 06:46.322
I didn't go after anybody.
I thought my driver was in trouble.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.366
-Then be more careful next time.
-Okay.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.618
-You have a family.
-Okay.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.121
-Look at you.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.082
I'm okay, Maggie. I'm okay.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.587
What kind of a lawyer are you anyway, huh?

07:02.547 --> 07:05.550
The kind that goes
the extra mile for his clients.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.345
You can be
such an asshole sometimes.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.017
I thought I lost you, Mickey.

07:15.935 --> 07:20.273
First, the accident and then the pills.
And then this, I thought I lost you again.

07:20.356 --> 07:24.277
Maggie, listen to me.
You're never gonna lose me.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.524
-Shit.
-What?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.737
That's gotta be Hayley.
I have to pick her up.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.823
Does she know what happened?

08:10.907 --> 08:14.076
Uh… No, not yet. But, um…

08:19.499 --> 08:21.959
-You said family.
-What?

08:23.544 --> 08:25.254
Before, you said I had a family.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.883
I wanna try again, Maggie.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.845
I want our family back.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.063
Sunday dinner like we used to.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
Say yes, before I change my mind.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.027
-Yes.
-Okay.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.745
Margarita. Rocks. Lots of salt.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.872
Gloria? It's Gloria right?

09:42.790 --> 09:46.085
-Who are you?
-I work for Mickey Haller, the lawyer.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.921
-You fuckers ambushed me?
-No.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.840
Please. Hear me out.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.260
-You wanna go?
-I did not come to fight you.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.512
I just need to talk to you. Five minutes.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.180
Here you go, ma'am.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.894
You've got until I finish this.
I'm taking an Uber back to the airport.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.812
Okay.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.608
Jesús Menendez,
he's innocent. You know it.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.777
That and ten bucks
will buy you this drink.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.781
Look, I'm sorry for your client,
but I'm nobody's hero.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.867
Just leave me alone, okay?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.036
Okay.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.581
Can I ask you something real quick?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.626
You ever do anything crazy?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.212
I flew here from Las Vegas

10:30.296 --> 10:32.673
to give a furniture salesman
the girlfriend experience.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.674
What do you think?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
Couple years ago, I did something crazy.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.262
I went to law school.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.183
Why is that crazy? You work for a lawyer.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.852
No one in my family
had ever gone to college.

10:45.603 --> 10:49.106
So I was nervous.
I didn't even tell Mickey about it.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.151
And?

10:52.234 --> 10:57.156
It was a lot of work.
But I loved my courses.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.116
There was this one called Torts,
which is funny

10:59.200 --> 11:02.662
because it sounds like you're
making a cake, but it means injuries.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.790
-Physical, emotional, you name it.

11:06.540 --> 11:10.336
My professor said I was a natural.
He said I thought like a lawyer.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.798
Made me feel like I could do it, you know.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.091
Like I belonged.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.719
And then he hit on me.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.680
Hmm.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.766
One night, his office,
he tried to do a lot more.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.935
Let me guess, you got out of there.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.478
Yeah?

11:28.354 --> 11:32.191
All the insecurities came back.
You started doubting yourself.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.360
Yeah.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.531
Save it for your book club, honey.
You don't get me, you never will.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.744
I get that you're afraid.
I get why you don't wanna speak up.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.705
This guy who attacked you,
is still out there.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.874
-He took something from you.
-No man took anything from me.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.961
-I look out for myself.
-What about the woman who was killed?

11:52.670 --> 11:56.424
Martha Renteria.
You escaped this psycho. She didn't.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.220
You were friends, weren't you?

12:02.304 --> 12:05.725
That's why you called Mickey
and told him the cops had the wrong guy.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.812
I understand why you would be afraid,

12:10.688 --> 12:12.857
but Mickey can make sure you're protected.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.154
You did the right thing once.
For your friend.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.032
Even though it was crazy.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.249
If you wanna do it again,
you know where to find us.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.376
Or you can keep running.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.550
<i>This is Michael Haller.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

12:39.633 --> 12:41.343
Hey. It's me.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.804
I, uh… Just checking in.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.639
Call me when you can.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.309
-What's up?
-Hey.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.146
We got a problem. The recording
of Soto's confession is garbled.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.564
The file's corrupted.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.775
What? Shit.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.319
We need Tanya's testimony.
It could bolster the recording.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.779
Not gonna happen. We made a deal.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.822
Seems like your ex
got the better of that deal.

13:01.906 --> 13:06.160
I didn't have a choice. I'm not putting a
pregnant woman on the stand against Soto.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.205
You heard that entire confession,
you could testify too.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.998
-You've done that before.
-Sure.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.250
I wanna make sure
we're dotting all the i's.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.796
You and me both.
Okay, I have a motion to write.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.469
-Anything?
-Without Glory Days? Nothing.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.263
-What's that?
-You wanted to know about McSweeney.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.559
-Anything stand out?
-Ex-Army.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.229
Moved here from Missouri 14 years ago.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.107
Rap sheet's just as long,
but hard to find any connection

13:37.191 --> 13:40.194
-when I don't know what I'm looking for.
-Ugh. Join the club.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.363
You think Trevor sent this guy after you?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.659
I don't know.
Right now, everything's on the table.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.831
-I got the mail.
-Mostly bills, I'm assuming?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.375
Except this.
You've been summoned for jury duty.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.376
Oof.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.337
-You never get picked?
-Not when they hear I'm a defense lawyer.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.130
All right. Gotta run to court.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.553
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

14:10.432 --> 14:14.645
-Your girl here said you could protect me?
-I can get the police to protect you.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.397
-Set you up some place.
-No.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.899
That's who I need you to protect me from.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.693
What do you mean?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.404
The night before
I was supposed to testify,

14:23.487 --> 14:25.364
I was at that hotel you put me up at.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.616
There was a knock at the door.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.120
-They must have followed me.
-The cops?

14:31.829 --> 14:36.417
A cop. Perez. Linda Perez.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.085
She worked Vice.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.755
She was usually
decent enough, but not this time.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.010
A week before, she'd busted me
with some guys I was partying with.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.888
They had enough
coke on them for intent to distribute.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.516
She said if I testified for you,
they'd charge me on the drugs too.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.644
Told me to get out of town
where you wouldn't find me,

14:55.728 --> 14:58.105
or she'd make it
her mission to fuck up my life.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.152
You know what a threat that is?
A Vice cop has it out for me?

15:04.653 --> 15:06.906
I didn't run
because of the guy that attacked me.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.574
It was her.

15:08.657 --> 15:12.286
Why would she be so interested
in the Jesús Menendez trial?

15:12.369 --> 15:13.787
She didn't say.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.081
And I didn't ask.

15:18.751 --> 15:23.380
I just saw Judge Holder. She signed off
on a hearing for Jesús Menendez.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.175
-<i>Yes.</i>
-We haven't won anything yet.

15:26.258 --> 15:30.095
But, uh, if we pull this off,
Jesús gets a new trial, Lorna.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.348
-He gets out.
-<i>I still don't get it.</i>

15:32.431 --> 15:36.018
Why would Perez put herself at risk
for a case that wasn't even hers?

15:36.101 --> 15:39.438
Yeah. I got a theory on that.
I'll call you later, all right?

15:39.521 --> 15:40.773
What's so urgent?

15:40.856 --> 15:44.193
Funny. I seem to remember
a time you came to me,

15:44.276 --> 15:45.945
to my house, asked for my help.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.780
Which I still don't think I got.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.075
I told you everything I know
about who killed Jerry Vincent.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.077
Yeah, if you say so.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.704
Fine. Quid pro quo. What do you want?

15:55.788 --> 15:59.416
You ever run across a Detective
Kyle Winters up there in the glass house?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.210
Heard the name, yeah.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.921
He was a lead on a homicide case
I had a couple of years ago.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.591
-You hear anything else about him?
-Only that he is a good detective.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.928
The kind who would send a Vice cop
to scare off my witness?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.846
This about that habeas thing?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.724
-That's right.
-Fuck off, Haller.

16:15.808 --> 16:20.104
I don't investigate cops
for defense lawyers, quid pro quo or not.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.897
Know the old saying, don't you?

16:22.648 --> 16:26.735
"Better a thousand guilty men go free
than one innocent man rot in prison."

16:27.945 --> 16:29.488
You ever clock out, Counselor?

16:30.447 --> 16:33.617
Linda Perez put in
for promotion twice and got denied.

16:33.701 --> 16:37.913
You wanna talk about quid pro quo?
Winters got her to scare off my witness.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.874
Then he greased the wheels
so she could move up the ranks.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.253
This is not about the thousand, Detective.
This is about the one.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.011
I heard your client's having
a big press thing later today.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.595
Something about a merger?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.181
Yeah, well,
he's not my client anymore, so…

16:56.265 --> 16:58.434
Then maybe you forgot an old saying too.

16:59.143 --> 17:03.689
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

17:23.208 --> 17:25.502
I was not expecting to see you here.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.505
I'm here because
somebody tried to fucking kill me, Trevor.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.717
In your line of work,
guess you make some enemies.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.678
Yeah, maybe.
But at least they tell it to my face.

17:35.763 --> 17:40.768
Mickey, I told you I was extremely happy
with the work you did for me.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.771
-Why would I want you dead?
-To keep me quiet?

17:44.730 --> 17:47.941
I mean, attorney-client privilege
takes care of that, right?

17:48.025 --> 17:51.195
I want you to know
something, Trevor. I wrote it all down.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.741
Something happens to me or my family,
it'll go to places you don't want it to.

17:55.824 --> 17:56.909
I didn't do anything.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
Mickey, you sound paranoid.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.538
Think about talking to somebody.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.250
If you'll excuse me,
I got a big announcement to make.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.133
-Hey!

18:13.217 --> 18:15.511
Mr. Elliott, do you have any statements?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.347
We love you.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.974
Thank you, Mr. Elliott.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.894
What do you say to the people
who think you got away with murder?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.688
-I'm glad they weren't on the jury.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.734
Seriously, the people that heard
all the evidence made the right decision.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.778
-That's all that matters.
-Yeah!

18:32.861 --> 18:35.614
But that is not
what we're here to talk about today.

18:35.697 --> 18:40.035
We're here to talk about the next stage
in the evolution of Parallax Games.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.295
Now, this is the culmination
of years of work and planning by me…

18:52.297 --> 18:53.382
and by Lara.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.093
And I wanna begin by thanking all of you.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.554
Our fans.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping the faith.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.649
-You son of a bitch!

19:11.733 --> 19:13.318
That is what you get.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.071
That is what you get.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.575
-Drop your weapon.
-On the ground.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.868
Clear.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.578
On the ground!

19:37.050 --> 19:40.929
<i>…shocking events</i>
<i>that have just unfolded at Parallax Games.</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:43.724
<i>The shooter</i>
<i>has been identified as Carol Dubois,</i>

19:43.807 --> 19:46.101
<i>a Santa Monica insurance agent…</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:49.688
Well, if it was Trevor behind it,
now we'll never know.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.023
<i>Yeah, maybe not.</i>

19:51.106 --> 19:54.109
But at least he won't be in a position
to send anybody else after me.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.445
<i>-All right, I gotta go.</i>
-Okay.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.713
Cisco, it's me.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.259
Listen, McSweeney's record,
that's what I need to know about.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.136
What was he arrested for?
Who represented him? Everything.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.806
-Haller?
-I gotta run. I'll call you back.

21:06.682 --> 21:10.269
-Thanks for coming on a Sunday.
-Lucky for you, I've got no life either.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.605
I heard about Elliott.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.526
When I was on patrol,
we had a term for it,

21:17.609 --> 21:18.944
for when somebody got off,

21:19.027 --> 21:21.697
then got what they had
coming to them on the street.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.825
We called it the Brass Verdict.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.120
Attorney-client privilege
continues, Detective.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.913
Even after my client's death.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.083
Whatever Trevor may have done,
stays with me.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.420
Honestly, I don't think he had
anything to do with Jerry's murder.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.298
-Then who did?
-I'm not sure yet.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.799
I just thought of something.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.302
The calls Jerry got from the Feds…

21:43.385 --> 21:46.471
-About the bribe.
-Okay. Say there was a bribe.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.809
Say it was a juror.
If the Feds were looking into it,

21:51.935 --> 21:54.730
you think this is the first time
it ever happened?

22:12.331 --> 22:15.292
-<i>Cabin on Lake Tahoe, great trip.</i>
-<i>It was.</i>

22:15.375 --> 22:17.044
Remember you tried
learning to snowboard?

22:17.127 --> 22:19.796
Okay, that part didn't work out.
Thank you very much.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.674
And remember the Grand Canyon?
I was, like, what? Seven?

22:22.758 --> 22:24.217
Yeah, we rented that trailer.

22:24.301 --> 22:28.138
And you made us stop in
Chuckawalla State Prison to meet a client.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.432
Yeah, a forger I think.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.768
-What? It was on the way.
-It so was not.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.938
I thought it was cool.
I mean, kind of scary, but cool.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.401
Here, let me help you, honey.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.363
No, it's okay.
You guys sit, and I've got this part.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.907
-Okay?
-Okay.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.534
Since when
does she volunteer to do the dishes?

22:50.160 --> 22:51.995
Since we're having dinner probably.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.750
I don't want to be confusing her.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.961
Neither do I. But she's having fun.

23:00.045 --> 23:00.879
She is.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.425
I gotta ask about the sign that you…
You're supporting Cardone?

23:06.051 --> 23:07.928
He's a reformer.
Thought you'd give me props.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.680
Better than Janelle.
But still, I don't like him.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.265
There's a surprise.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.895
Yeah, you know, he's not perfect,
but at least he cares. Janelle…

23:16.978 --> 23:19.981
Whoever's running
for that office is running on ambition.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.944
-All right? Just don't expect anything.
-Well, a girl can dream, can't she?

23:29.741 --> 23:34.454
Next weekend, big game.
They win this one, they go to regionals.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.874
Can't wait. Might have to poison
the other team's Gatorade.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.918
That won't go over too well.

23:40.001 --> 23:42.170
-Just a little bit?
-Just a little.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.389
This is everything I got
on McSweeney's record.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.521
Is it what you were expecting?

24:01.148 --> 24:03.859
-Unfortunately, yes.
-So, what you gonna do about it?

24:04.568 --> 24:07.446
Right now, nothing.
I got a hearing to win.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.448
Just make sure you get this to Griggs.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.616
Everything all right?

24:12.325 --> 24:15.203
You seem, uh, awfully quiet, even for you.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.247
Nah, I'm good.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.376
Break a leg, Mick.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.629
All right.

24:32.220 --> 24:36.057
Miss Dayton, did there come
a time that you called me about this case?

24:36.141 --> 24:40.979
Yes. I saw you on the news.
You're the lawyer for Jesús Menendez.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.648
And why'd that matter to you?

24:43.732 --> 24:46.193
Because he was charged
with killing a girl I knew.

24:46.276 --> 24:49.654
Martha Renteria.
And because, a month before,

24:49.738 --> 24:51.865
I had a client who tried to kill me too.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.034
Can you tell us what happened?

24:54.784 --> 24:58.538
He came at me with a knife,
but I kicked him in the balls.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.583
And then,
I ran like hell and got out of there.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.668
Did you call the police after?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.004
No. I knew they wouldn't believe me,

25:06.087 --> 25:08.590
or they'd blame me
because of my profession.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.009
So, what was it
that made you call me?

25:13.011 --> 25:16.765
The guy with the knife
said he was the one who killed Martha.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.684
He said he got away with it.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.104
And that he was
gonna get away with killing me too.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.234
But he wasn't the guy
whose picture I saw on the news.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.361
-He was not Jesús Menendez?
-No.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.740
I called you because
they had the wrong guy in jail.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.910
What kind of knife did he have?

25:37.619 --> 25:39.621
The kind you unfold to open.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.457
Do you remember which hand it was in?

25:42.541 --> 25:43.959
It was his left hand.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.462
He had a tattoo on his forearm.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.172
Japanese writing, kanji.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.967
Your Honor, I'd like the record
to reflect our previous exhibits

25:52.050 --> 25:55.220
from the medical examiner
indicating that Martha Renteria

25:55.303 --> 25:58.557
was stabbed by a man wielding a folding
hunting knife in his left hand.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.811
Also, photos of Jesús Menendez
showing that he has no such tattoo.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.313
-So noted.
-Miss Dayton, did you agree

26:05.397 --> 26:08.942
to testify and tell your story to the jury
in the Jesús Menendez case?

26:09.025 --> 26:11.319
I did. At first.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.113
And what made you change your mind?

26:13.196 --> 26:17.200
I was staying in a hotel the night
before I was supposed to testify,

26:17.284 --> 26:19.828
and this Vice cop I knew showed up.

26:19.911 --> 26:23.290
-Linda Perez.
-What did she want?

26:23.373 --> 26:28.670
She told me I had to get out of town,
or I'd take a bust on a bogus drug charge.

26:29.546 --> 26:33.216
She said, with my record,
I'd get three years,

26:33.300 --> 26:35.427
and she'd find a way to tack on more.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.596
Did she say why you had to go?

26:39.514 --> 26:45.604
She said I was being used by
a sleazy lawyer to let a killer go free.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.816
No further questions, Your Honor.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.319
Mr. Miller.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.949
Your Honor, the prosecution
would like to note Miss Dayton,

26:58.033 --> 27:00.285
who also goes by the name Glory Days,

27:00.368 --> 27:04.706
has been arrested at least ten different
times for prostitution and drug charges.

27:04.789 --> 27:08.877
Not to mention, we have no idea
what fee arrangement she may have made

27:08.960 --> 27:12.088
-with Mr. Haller to testify here today.
-Objection.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.799
Save it, Mr. Haller. It's just us here.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.928
I'm not being paid to be here,
if that's what you mean.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.807
This son of a bitch
killed my friend and got away with it,

27:22.891 --> 27:25.935
and then some kid took the fall.
It wasn't right.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.771
That's all.

27:30.106 --> 27:32.233
-Nothing further, Your Honor.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.777
Witness is excused.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.156
-Mr. Haller, you have another?
-Yes, Your Honor.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.908
The defense calls Linda Perez.

28:01.262 --> 28:05.016
Detective Perez, do you know
the previous witness, Gloria Dayton?

28:05.934 --> 28:08.895
Yes, I do.
I've arrested her multiple times.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.397
She's well known in Vice.

28:11.022 --> 28:14.818
Did you go to the Bonaventure Hotel
on the night in question, October 20th,

28:14.901 --> 28:19.030
and use your previous experience with
Miss Dayton to force her to leave town?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.198
No, I did not.

28:20.281 --> 28:23.743
You telling this court you weren't
even at the Bonaventure Hotel that night?

28:23.827 --> 28:26.955
-That's correct, yes.
-Can I ask where you were?

28:27.664 --> 28:31.209
I was on a camping trip
with my husband and my son. Big Bear.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.671
Do you have any hotel receipts
or anything to prove you were away?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.549
Like I said, I went camping.

28:38.341 --> 28:42.846
Right. Your Honor, the defense wishes
to introduce defense exhibit E.

28:42.929 --> 28:46.349
Objection.
There is no exhibit E in discovery.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.769
This wasn't in discovery.
It's security footage that will serve

28:49.853 --> 28:52.689
to directly impeach the testimony
of Detective Perez, Your Honor.

28:52.772 --> 28:53.606
Your Honor--

28:53.690 --> 28:57.026
There is no jury
to prejudice here, Mr. Miller, just me.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.905
I wanna get to the bottom of this,
so show your footage, Mr. Haller.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.574
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:02.657 --> 29:05.535
On the night in question,
I put Miss Dayton up

29:05.618 --> 29:08.830
at the Bonaventure Hotel
just up the street from this courthouse.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.417
Now, this video taken at 9:52 p.m.,

29:12.500 --> 29:14.836
shows Miss Dayton leaving,
as she testified.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.798
I have an affidavit from
the hotel security manager to verify it.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.177
Now, I scoured the footage at the time

29:22.260 --> 29:25.388
but I didn't know
what I was looking for. Now I do.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.393
This footage is from 48 minutes earlier.
This is a service elevator.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.646
They often don't have
security cameras but this one did.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.733
Now, Detective Perez,
is that you we see in the elevator?

29:39.694 --> 29:41.738
-Your Honor, if I may?

29:41.821 --> 29:45.074
Mr. Daly, you care to explain
why you're interrupting my court?

29:45.158 --> 29:48.077
My apologies,
but I am representing Detective Perez,

29:48.161 --> 29:49.704
and I need to confer with my client.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.249
Otherwise, I will advise her to exercise
her right under the Fifth Amendment

29:53.333 --> 29:54.834
not to incriminate herself.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.045
Sidebar, now.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.880
This includes you too, Mr. Daly.

30:01.674 --> 30:06.012
-Your Honor, before we begin--
-Shut it, Mr. Miller.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.973
Now, there's only one thing
that is important here,

30:09.057 --> 30:12.727
and that's, a while back,
I sent a man to prison for 15 years.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.938
Now, I am telling the three of you,

30:15.021 --> 30:17.357
if there is anything wrong
with that sentence,

30:17.440 --> 30:20.777
we're going to get
to the bottom of it right fucking now.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.405
Uh, Stacy, you wanna clean that up a bit?

30:25.448 --> 30:29.869
So, Mr. Daly, you're gonna confer
with your client, and we will reconvene.

30:30.411 --> 30:33.289
And if Detective Perez
lies to this court again,

30:33.373 --> 30:35.166
she's gonna go to jail too.

30:36.709 --> 30:37.752
Are we clear?

30:38.378 --> 30:39.838
Yes, Your Honor.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.397
-Gloria okay?
-Yeah, she's back at the hotel.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.275
-What's goin' on?
-It's happening, Lorna.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.987
Oh, my God. Mickey.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.708
Thought you didn't
investigate cops for defense lawyers?

31:16.791 --> 31:19.085
Yeah, I must be
getting soft in my old age.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.713
So, Perez's lawyer's
meeting with the prosecutor.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.841
They've gotta be
negotiating an immunity deal,

31:24.924 --> 31:26.718
then she'll turn on Winters.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.470
Yeah, uh…

31:30.889 --> 31:32.056
About that…

31:56.247 --> 31:57.373
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.125
I thought you had a hearing.

31:59.208 --> 32:02.170
-Yeah, no, we're in a recess.
-Can we talk later?

32:02.253 --> 32:05.715
I've got a status conference
in ten minutes. Did you run here?

32:05.798 --> 32:07.800
Your status conference,
is that for the Soto case?

32:07.884 --> 32:08.843
Yeah.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.847
-Any chance he'll plead out?
-Not since we added a murder charge.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.433
Soto killed a witness.
Nobody gets a deal on that.

32:15.516 --> 32:19.479
I don't know, Maggie.
Maybe you should reconsider.

32:19.562 --> 32:23.441
I mean, I know Pomerantz is a good lawyer,
and you lost your recording, right?

32:23.524 --> 32:25.735
You don't want Soto
to walk on some technicality.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.821
What are you really doing here?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.823
-I…
-I'm not putting your client in danger.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.242
-We made a deal.
-No, it's not about Tanya.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.327
Then what?

32:34.410 --> 32:37.080
Think I'm not good enough
to beat Soto's dream team?

32:37.163 --> 32:38.289
No, come on.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.417
I just know how much
this case means to you,

32:41.501 --> 32:43.127
I don't want you to regret anything.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.880
The only thing I'll regret
is not putting this guy away.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.842
Listen, I gotta go, I'm sorry but,
Sunday dinner, Hayley wants burgers.

32:49.926 --> 32:55.098
They're gonna make another offer, Maggie.
That's what I'd do. Just, uh, take it.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.643
Since when did you
become such a worrier, Haller?

32:58.726 --> 32:59.811
See you Sunday.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.885
<i>Detective Perez,</i>
<i>you've had the opportunity</i>

33:32.969 --> 33:34.637
<i>to confer with your counsel,</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:38.808
and now are you prepared to continue
and answer all questions truthfully?

33:38.891 --> 33:40.184
Yes, Your Honor.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.354
-Mr. Haller.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.189
Detective Perez,

33:46.107 --> 33:48.276
now for the record,
were you or were you not

33:48.359 --> 33:51.404
in the Bonaventure Hotel
on the night of October 20th?

33:51.487 --> 33:53.906
-Yes, I was.
-What were you doing there?

33:55.283 --> 33:56.743
I was there to see Gloria Dayton.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.370
To threaten her
into leaving town?

34:01.289 --> 34:02.290
Yes.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.876
But I wasn't there for myself,

34:06.544 --> 34:08.629
I was asked to go there by somebody else.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.673
Another cop, a detective.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.177
And why did this detective
ask you to do this?

34:16.679 --> 34:18.723
He said Jesús Menendez was guilty

34:19.557 --> 34:23.061
and that he was gonna walk
on the word of some pros.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.899
Did this detective promise
you anything in return for your help?

34:27.982 --> 34:31.944
Look, I was stuck in Vice for three years,
I just wanted to be a detective.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.783
And he said he
could help move the roadblock.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.868
You know?

34:38.951 --> 34:41.037
Is that man in the courtroom right now?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.165
Yes.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.042
Can you point him out, please?

34:46.125 --> 34:47.502
He's standing in the back.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.963
Let the record show, the witness
has pointed to Detective Lee Lankford.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.549
You low-life son of a bitch.
This is all lies.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.176
-Order!
-She's in on it!

34:55.259 --> 34:57.178
She cut a deal to save her own ass!

34:57.261 --> 35:01.349
One more word out of your mouth, sir,
and you will be held in contempt.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.102
And I strongly advise you
to retain legal counsel

35:04.185 --> 35:06.062
-immediately!

35:06.896 --> 35:09.482
This court is in recess until tomorrow.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.997
Lankford lawyered up.
He's gonna plead the Fifth.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.041
It's as good as an admission of guilt.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.293
-Maggie, I--
-Let me get this out, okay?

35:31.129 --> 35:34.715
Almost a year now,
I've been building this case.

35:35.550 --> 35:39.846
I met with trafficking victims…
You should have seen them, Mickey,

35:39.929 --> 35:41.264
what Soto did to them.

35:42.515 --> 35:46.352
And then I found Loresca
and I convinced him to talk.

35:48.437 --> 35:53.276
I have never
lost a witness like that, so brazen.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.111
And Hayley…

35:56.154 --> 36:00.116
I laid everything
on the line for this case.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.368
And now I have nothing.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.163
No confession, no witness.

36:05.246 --> 36:11.085
My entire case was built on Lankford's
testimony, and now it's worthless.

36:11.794 --> 36:13.546
Maggie, I didn't know it was Lankford.

36:13.629 --> 36:17.758
Kyle Winters was a detective on the case.
Lankford was the supervisor.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.720
He wanted to help his protégé,
that didn't occur to you?

36:20.803 --> 36:21.971
I tried to warn you.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.223
You told me to take a plea,
you didn't warn me.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.851
I couldn't risk
tipping off Lankford, Maggie.

36:26.934 --> 36:30.980
And you couldn't trust me not to tell him?

36:32.023 --> 36:35.651
-We could have found another way.
-I have a duty to my client.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.070
And that always comes first, doesn't it?

36:38.154 --> 36:41.532
Seriously? When did I
ever come first, huh?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.868
-Be honest.
-Excuse me?

36:43.951 --> 36:46.329
All of it,
the second-chairing, the fundraisers,

36:46.412 --> 36:49.290
all the face time you put in
to get into Major Crimes.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.710
-Should I apologize for being ambitious?
-No, but at least be honest.

36:52.793 --> 36:56.005
If you were in my shoes,
would things be any different?

36:56.714 --> 36:57.548
Huh?

37:00.134 --> 37:01.969
-Maybe that's our problem.
-What?

37:03.971 --> 37:06.515
Some lawyers,
they can just leave it at the office.

37:07.099 --> 37:09.185
Lock it up, get on with their lives.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.395
It's not me.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.731
It's certainly not you.

37:15.524 --> 37:20.196
And this,
this isn't something I can just get past.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.324
Maybe someday, but not today.

37:26.702 --> 37:27.954
Then I'll wait.

37:29.705 --> 37:34.168
Please don't. Just add it
to the list of reasons we don't work.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.297
Aw, Maggie. Maggie. Maggie!

37:38.381 --> 37:40.216
-Shit.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.182
So, you talked to your mom?

38:30.891 --> 38:31.767
A little.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.895
Look, I know this isn't
the Sunday dinner you wanted.

38:35.855 --> 38:36.897
I'm sorry.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.819
It's okay to be disappointed, to be mad.

38:43.029 --> 38:48.743
I mean, deep down, I knew this Mom and Dad
sequel was just never gonna happen. So…

38:48.826 --> 38:50.536
Wow. That's, uh…

38:50.619 --> 38:51.954
Would be easier if you were mad.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.708
This thing that went down
between you and Mom,

38:55.791 --> 38:57.293
I mean, was it even worth it?

39:00.254 --> 39:02.965
There's three things
you need to know in life, <i>hija.</i>

39:04.175 --> 39:08.888
What you desire, what you believe,
and what you have to do.

39:08.971 --> 39:12.850
-They don't always line up.
-Was that from your dad?

39:13.768 --> 39:16.020
No, St. Thomas Aquinas.

39:16.103 --> 39:20.191
Your <i>abuelo</i> was a lot of things,
but a saint wasn't one of them.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.115
Well, my accident
was a week after Jesús went away.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.744
Was I reckless? Was I angry?

39:32.370 --> 39:35.331
Is that why it happened? I don't know.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.959
All I know is
I had to make this right, Hayley.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.712
That's the thing I had to do.

39:49.804 --> 39:54.141
Now, come on. If I don't feed you,
I'll really be in hot water.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.160
-Bob, hey. I wasn't expecting you.
-I'm just making the rounds.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.620
Uh, have a seat.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.415
Sorry, I've been prepping for trial.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.000
You gotta see my office,
it's why I came to you.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.255
About that case
you're prepping, the Soto case.

40:24.338 --> 40:27.925
Yeah, listen, I know Detective Lankford's
credibility has been damaged,

40:28.008 --> 40:29.635
-but I have a plan to regroup--
-Maggie.

40:30.636 --> 40:31.512
The case is dead.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.724
Look, I ran on a platform
of holding bad cops accountable.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.810
I can't just look the other way on this.

40:38.394 --> 40:42.481
Wait, I'm sorry, I…
You're just gonna let Soto walk?

40:42.565 --> 40:47.278
That's on the LAPD. Another thing,
after you handle the dismissal,

40:47.361 --> 40:49.780
I'm gonna be making
a few changes in the office.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.246
What… Seriously?
You're giving me freeway therapy?

40:57.329 --> 41:01.417
Van Nuys has a very busy trial pool
with some serious high-profile cases.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.461
This is no reflection
on the quality of your work.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.463
Or my loyalty, apparently.

41:05.546 --> 41:09.383
-Maggie, this is not personal.
-No, of course not.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.014
-I appreciate your understanding.
-Do me a favor, Bob?

41:15.097 --> 41:17.475
Get the fuck out of my office
while it's still mine.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.144
Okay.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.748
Hey, Sarah. It's Maggie.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.336
I'm good, thanks.
Listen, I got something for you.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.229
We need to talk.

42:03.312 --> 42:06.148
Well, you got a pair on you.
I'll give you that.

42:06.774 --> 42:10.069
Whatever deal you made
with Haller, it's off.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.698
That seems like a conversation
best had with him, Cisco.

42:14.782 --> 42:17.618
Mickey got Hard Case off his parole hit.

42:17.701 --> 42:20.621
Now he's back cooking meth,
that's a big win for you guys.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.791
But our bill
says that it was on the house.

42:23.874 --> 42:28.128
Nobody would do pro-bono cases
for the Saints, not without good reason.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.340
What'd you think was gonna happen
when you left, Cisco?

42:32.216 --> 42:33.509
This ain't a social club.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.304
You can't just walk away
whenever you want.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.765
'Course Mickey made a deal.

42:39.848 --> 42:40.933
For you!

42:45.479 --> 42:47.273
Whatever debt I owe,

42:48.107 --> 42:51.068
I pay, nobody else.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.620
Well…

43:03.414 --> 43:07.585
Now that you mention it,
there might be a way.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.758
Miss McPherson,
I've reviewed your submission.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.219
Is it the People's wish
to dismiss all charges

43:17.303 --> 43:19.930
against Angelo Soto without prejudice?

43:20.014 --> 43:21.473
It is, Your Honor.

43:21.557 --> 43:23.767
Mr. Pomerantz, do you have any objection?

43:26.228 --> 43:28.355
Yes, Judge. A dismissal without an apology

43:28.439 --> 43:31.400
does nothing to repair the damage
to Mr. Soto's reputation.

43:31.483 --> 43:34.653
That matters not before the court,
I'll take that as a no.

43:34.737 --> 43:38.282
Therefore, in the matter of
the <i>People vs. Angelo Soto,</i>

43:38.365 --> 43:41.952
this case is hereby dismissed.
Mr. Soto, you are free to go.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.706
-Thank you.
-One moment please, Your Honor.

43:45.789 --> 43:47.833
-Sorry, who are you?
-I'm Sarah Walker.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.627
An assistant United States attorney.

43:49.710 --> 43:52.921
Angelo Soto, you're under arrest
for human trafficking and conspiracy

43:53.005 --> 43:56.216
-under 18 US Code 77 and 96.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.384
Ma'am, I--

43:59.470 --> 44:01.889
This is bullshit,
it'll end up just like this case.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.849
The Feds have deep pockets
and lots of time,

44:03.932 --> 44:06.352
but if this does go south,
I'll see you again.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.771
DAs come and go, I don't.

44:38.425 --> 44:40.302
<i>I have to admit, I was skeptical.</i>

44:40.928 --> 44:44.723
Taking over an entire law practice
and a murder trial.

44:44.807 --> 44:46.475
But you pulled it off.

44:46.558 --> 44:49.061
To be honest,
I wasn't sure about it either.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.397
I kept that to myself.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.358
You even got
a client in prison a new trial.

44:54.441 --> 44:57.403
And the police are looking
for this suspect with the tattoo.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.947
You should be proud, Mr. Haller.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.866
I am sorry about
what happened to Trevor Elliott though.

45:03.992 --> 45:07.871
Yeah. I'm still processing that,
but thank you.

45:07.955 --> 45:11.542
Well, it looks like
Mr. Vincent's cases are in good hands.

45:12.251 --> 45:16.463
So, I'm taking the training wheels off.
This will be our last check-in.

45:18.006 --> 45:19.883
I wish you well, Mr. Haller.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.011
You know, I wanted to do right by Jerry.

45:24.805 --> 45:27.391
He was no angel
but he didn't deserve to die.

45:28.016 --> 45:30.644
-I'm sorry about that too.
-Are you?

45:30.728 --> 45:33.480
Six figures a pop to rig a jury that…

45:33.564 --> 45:35.190
Not a bad side hustle.

45:35.941 --> 45:37.234
Excuse me?

45:37.317 --> 45:40.362
But Jerry threw a wrench in it,
so he had to go, right?

45:40.446 --> 45:45.075
Mr. Haller, clearly I was hasty in
my assessment of your state of mind.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.870
-You need to get some help.
-I'm stone-cold sober.

45:47.953 --> 45:50.539
I thought long and hard
about who was behind this.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.916
<i>Had to be someone with enough control</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:55.753
<i>to hijack a jury summons</i>
<i>before it went out in the mail.</i>

45:55.836 --> 45:57.921
There are dozens of people
in this courthouse

45:58.005 --> 45:59.339
with access to that, so…

45:59.423 --> 46:01.842
Maybe, but it also had to be someone

46:01.925 --> 46:04.720
with a deep understanding
of the jury selection process.

46:04.803 --> 46:08.599
<i>Because the real juror had to be</i>
<i>someone the prosecutor wouldn't cut,</i>

46:08.682 --> 46:11.435
but who wouldn't be
a red flag for the defense either.

46:11.518 --> 46:12.603
<i>Someone like an…</i>

46:12.686 --> 46:14.354
Aerospace engineer at Lockheed Martin.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.608
That's knowledge only an expert
in jury selection would have.

46:17.691 --> 46:22.196
For instance, a judge
and her husband, a defense attorney.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.032
My husband knew him a little.
Mitch Lester?

46:25.115 --> 46:27.075
He's a defense attorney also.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.871
What gave it away was the anonymous note
I sent to Judge Stanton.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.999
The day after I sent it,
McSweeney disappeared.

46:34.082 --> 46:35.793
How did he know I was onto him?

46:35.876 --> 46:37.878
Judge Stanton gave me the answer.

46:38.587 --> 46:41.507
He said he conferred
with some colleagues about the letter.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.592
That would include you, you're his boss.

46:44.426 --> 46:46.178
You told McSweeney about it.

46:46.261 --> 46:49.139
Another word,
and I will jail you for contempt.

46:49.223 --> 46:52.226
And when the case was over,
you sent him to kill me too.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.561
You had the perfect way to draw me out.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.397
My driver's addiction,
which you knew about

46:57.481 --> 47:00.484
because you hired
a shady PI firm to bug my car.

47:03.153 --> 47:07.282
I don't think you appreciate
the power I wield, Mr. Haller.

47:08.450 --> 47:11.078
I still hold your career in my hands.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.748
And if you choose
to spread this preposterous story,

47:15.457 --> 47:16.500
I will end it.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.753
Hmm.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.631
It's a little late for that.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.135
See, my investigator and I found out

47:27.219 --> 47:30.055
McSweeney was
one of your husband's former clients.

47:30.138 --> 47:34.142
That gave the Feds
probable cause for a wiretap on you

47:34.226 --> 47:37.479
with a little help from
a friend of mine in the LAPD.

47:38.188 --> 47:41.650
You and your husband are gonna
need a really good lawyer, Judge.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.612
I'm sorry, I'm all booked up.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.970
You dropped some serious knowledge today,

48:10.053 --> 48:12.180
I feel like
I'm gonna go take the bar exam.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.641
Ah. Won't do you much good.

48:15.392 --> 48:18.562
I didn't learn any of the stuff
I just told you in law school.

48:18.645 --> 48:22.065
You must have learnt something,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.178
You go to church growing up?

48:51.762 --> 48:53.096
Every Sunday.

48:54.097 --> 48:55.432
Yeah, me too.

48:55.515 --> 48:57.059
Mostly with my mom.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.394
My dad, not so much of a church-goer.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.356
What?
You feeling spiritual?

49:02.898 --> 49:04.858
Going to meetings does that for some.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.902
Oh, no, that ship has sailed.

49:08.862 --> 49:13.450
It's just, you know, when you're a kid,
Christmas is a big one, right?

49:14.201 --> 49:15.953
The presents and everything.

49:16.995 --> 49:20.666
But my mom always told me
the more important day was Easter.

49:54.574 --> 49:55.450
Thank you.
