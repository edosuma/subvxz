WEBVTT

00:03.585 --> 00:07.245
So there I was,
face to face with the biggest,

00:07.315 --> 00:10.115
meanest leopard on this side
of the Serengeti. And...

00:10.195 --> 00:13.255
You roared so loud,
his spots flew clean off.

00:13.325 --> 00:15.695
Dad, I've heard this
like a billion times.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.735
Do you know the one where
I made the laughing hyenas...

00:18.795 --> 00:20.785
Cry? Yep.

00:20.865 --> 00:22.735
- The croc attack?
- Dad.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.705
OK. Think.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.935
Yeah, you do that.

00:27.005 --> 00:29.035
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

00:29.115 --> 00:31.905
here's one I know you haven't heard.

00:32.985 --> 00:37.445
It all started in the little place
I like to call...

00:39.625 --> 00:41.115
...the wild.

00:43.255 --> 00:46.385
<i>They were the fastest wildebeests
on the savannah.</i>

00:47.365 --> 00:49.695
<i>We're talking fast.</i>

00:49.765 --> 00:52.865
<i>All the other lions
had given up the hunt hours ago,</i>

00:52.935 --> 00:54.695
<i>except your old man.</i>

00:54.775 --> 00:57.505
<i>Fortunately, I knew a short cut.</i>

01:03.045 --> 01:05.885
<i>I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.</i>

01:07.155 --> 01:08.815
<i>Classic wildebeest trap.</i>

01:09.525 --> 01:10.815
<i>So, what did you do next?</i>

01:10.885 --> 01:12.545
<i>- What did I do?
- Yeah.</i>

01:12.625 --> 01:16.115
<i>That's when I gave them the roar.</i>

01:30.205 --> 01:33.145
<i>- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.</i>

01:33.215 --> 01:36.375
<i>I only thought it was over.</i>

01:36.445 --> 01:40.815
<i>But they had a secret weapon.</i>

01:40.885 --> 01:43.825
<i>He was the biggest wildebeest
I've ever seen.</i>

01:43.895 --> 01:46.755
<i>- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?</i>

01:46.825 --> 01:52.325
<i>I meant 1,401 feet tall!</i>

01:52.405 --> 01:54.305
<i>Cool.</i>

01:54.365 --> 01:57.365
<i>And he had two... No, four</i>

01:57.435 --> 02:00.375
<i>of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.</i>

02:01.805 --> 02:04.575
<i>- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!</i>

02:04.645 --> 02:06.235
<i>I mean, green.</i>

02:06.315 --> 02:08.615
<i>And he hated the environment.</i>

02:08.685 --> 02:11.655
<i>To pull this off, I knew I was
gonna have to dig deep,</i>

02:11.725 --> 02:13.715
<i>deeper than I ever had before.</i>

02:13.785 --> 02:15.725
<i>So I swallowed my fear,</i>

02:15.795 --> 02:17.985
<i>sucked in the biggest breath I could.</i>

02:18.065 --> 02:19.395
<i>Dad, I'm ready!</i>

02:19.465 --> 02:20.655
<i>- You got it?
- I got it!</i>

02:20.735 --> 02:22.395
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!

02:22.465 --> 02:25.095
Roar, son!

02:49.495 --> 02:51.465
Story of my life.

02:51.535 --> 02:55.095
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.

02:55.165 --> 02:57.295
Hey, come on. That was much better.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.635
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.

03:00.705 --> 03:04.975
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.

03:05.045 --> 03:08.445
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.

03:08.515 --> 03:11.955
- OK. Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.515
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.315
Maybe it's something technical.

03:16.395 --> 03:19.455
Maybe you're not opening your mouth
wide enough. Like this.

03:19.525 --> 03:23.195
Dad, thanks for the technical help,

03:23.265 --> 03:26.595
but if you wanted me to roar like you,
you'd take me to the wild.

03:26.665 --> 03:30.465
Hold on a second. We've got
everything we could ever want here.

03:30.535 --> 03:32.525
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.

03:32.605 --> 03:33.905
- It's boring.
- Boring?

03:33.975 --> 03:36.275
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.

03:36.345 --> 03:38.745
But don't worry. I finally figured out

03:38.815 --> 03:41.045
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?

03:41.115 --> 03:43.815
The pigeons say
those green boxes go there.

03:43.885 --> 03:46.655
Those boxes are bad news. Stay away.

03:46.725 --> 03:49.315
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,

03:49.395 --> 03:52.085
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.185
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!

03:55.265 --> 03:56.565
It's a rat!

03:56.635 --> 03:58.365
Get that rat off my baby!

03:58.435 --> 03:59.735
A rat?

04:01.435 --> 04:02.535
Hello!

04:02.605 --> 04:04.195
Silly, silly rat.

04:05.175 --> 04:08.705
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!

04:14.855 --> 04:18.385
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby
I've ever seen!

04:18.454 --> 04:21.115
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?

04:22.865 --> 04:26.225
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."

04:26.295 --> 04:29.095
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...

04:29.165 --> 04:32.295
- Octave.
- Octave!

04:32.605 --> 04:36.265
You ready to cheer me and your old man
as we capture our fifth straight

04:36.345 --> 04:39.675
turtle-curling title?

04:40.385 --> 04:43.645
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?

04:44.055 --> 04:46.285
So, you really think
it dropped an octave?

04:46.355 --> 04:48.585
Absolutely.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.685
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.

04:54.625 --> 04:58.625
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol. I'll stick with the nuts.

04:59.605 --> 05:01.725
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.

05:01.805 --> 05:04.895
He's 11, but he's still roaring
at a nine-year-old level.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.135
Little help here, Sammy?

05:09.575 --> 05:12.275
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high,

05:12.345 --> 05:14.875
with all those stories
about Samson the Wild.

05:14.955 --> 05:19.255
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.

05:19.325 --> 05:23.585
OK. I'm not gonna argue with someone
who can use my tail as dental floss.

05:24.665 --> 05:26.995
- You got something right there.
- Where?

05:27.065 --> 05:29.655
- No, no, other side.
- Here?

05:29.735 --> 05:31.825
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.

05:32.005 --> 05:33.435
<i>Attention, friends.</i>

05:33.505 --> 05:36.875
<i>Stop by the gift shop and get
the most popular plush in America:</i>

05:36.945 --> 05:38.875
<i>Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.</i>

05:38.945 --> 05:42.345
<i>- Look, honey! The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

05:42.415 --> 05:46.615
<i>That's right. He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.</i>

05:50.655 --> 05:52.215
Finally.

05:52.295 --> 05:55.555
And the zoo will officially be ours
in T-minus three...

05:56.895 --> 05:58.055
...two...

05:58.135 --> 06:00.755
...and showtime!

06:02.705 --> 06:04.565
Here I come!

06:05.635 --> 06:07.125
Who put that bar there?

06:12.745 --> 06:14.235
That tickles!

06:16.785 --> 06:18.145
- Did too!
- Did not!

06:18.215 --> 06:19.445
- Did too!
- Did not!

06:19.525 --> 06:20.745
Out of my way, ya bum!

06:20.825 --> 06:22.755
There's that moth-eaten koala!

06:22.825 --> 06:26.315
I've told you flamingos
a hundred times, walk.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.325
- How about an autograph?!
- Don't...

06:28.395 --> 06:30.795
Birds! Find the string on his back!

06:30.865 --> 06:33.965
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.

06:34.235 --> 06:36.035
Off my co-captain, now.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.575
Sorry, Samson.

06:39.405 --> 06:41.035
That didn't hurt.

06:41.115 --> 06:45.105
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.

06:45.185 --> 06:49.845
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...

06:49.915 --> 06:50.905
Perfect, right?

06:50.985 --> 06:55.225
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.

06:55.295 --> 06:57.695
Watch where you're goin', you big...!

07:07.535 --> 07:08.735
Bridget.

07:08.805 --> 07:11.435
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.

07:13.315 --> 07:17.775
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.115
It goes around your left hoof.

07:20.185 --> 07:21.915
Did you get that out of the trash?

07:23.555 --> 07:25.255
You did! You trash-picker!

07:25.325 --> 07:27.885
I'm not a trash-picker. I'm a recycler.

07:27.965 --> 07:30.935
That's a lot more romantic. Isn't it?

07:30.995 --> 07:32.625
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.

07:32.695 --> 07:35.165
Romantic? Don't mention
romance to me, Benny.

07:35.235 --> 07:37.665
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.

07:37.735 --> 07:40.135
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.

07:40.205 --> 07:43.005
Benny, only the female
orb-weaver spider

07:43.075 --> 07:45.475
will date a male
one-twentieth her size.

07:45.545 --> 07:48.015
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.

07:49.355 --> 07:51.645
But at least he dies happy.

07:55.425 --> 07:56.945
Let's get Ryan, dude!

07:57.025 --> 07:59.685
Dude! We said that at the same time!

07:59.765 --> 08:01.695
Dude.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.705
Hey! Hey, Ryan.

08:10.375 --> 08:14.175
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?

08:14.245 --> 08:17.045
Come on, Ryan. We need you.
You're our biggest fan.

08:17.115 --> 08:22.215
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!

08:22.285 --> 08:25.225
Thanks, man. Right back at ya!

08:25.285 --> 08:27.455
You were saying, Dad?

08:27.525 --> 08:30.355
Listen. About this afternoon,
I was just trying...

08:30.425 --> 08:33.725
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?

08:35.005 --> 08:39.304
OK. I'll... see you there, then.

08:48.485 --> 08:50.975
Come on, dude.

08:51.055 --> 08:53.715
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?

08:53.785 --> 08:55.945
Eze. Duke.

08:56.025 --> 08:58.085
Man, he always guesses.

08:58.155 --> 09:01.955
We're gonna stalk the gazelles
while everybody's at the game.

09:02.025 --> 09:05.935
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!

09:05.995 --> 09:07.465
The Ryanator.

09:08.605 --> 09:10.765
I'm comin' down.

09:11.275 --> 09:14.505
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!

09:14.575 --> 09:16.005
Now eyeball-free!

09:16.075 --> 09:19.175
We're into the final period
of the curling championships

09:19.245 --> 09:21.575
and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.

09:22.985 --> 09:24.955
What a beauty!

09:25.015 --> 09:26.075
Yeah, sweep!

09:26.155 --> 09:30.385
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!

09:30.455 --> 09:32.395
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!

09:32.465 --> 09:35.225
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.

09:35.295 --> 09:36.785
What? "Tough to beat"?

09:36.865 --> 09:39.265
That's just the way we like it,
right, guys?

09:42.335 --> 09:44.105
I can't believe this!

09:44.175 --> 09:47.905
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!

09:47.975 --> 09:50.275
We cannot lose to flightless birds!

09:50.345 --> 09:54.615
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.

09:54.685 --> 09:57.085
As long as we stay focused.

09:57.155 --> 09:59.915
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh! I know!

09:59.995 --> 10:03.085
Maybe he's sulking 'cause
he lives in his father's shadow

10:03.165 --> 10:05.285
and he roars like a schoolgirl.

10:05.365 --> 10:07.295
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!

10:07.365 --> 10:10.465
Nigel! Nigel! Will you sign my dolly?

10:10.535 --> 10:13.065
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.

10:13.135 --> 10:14.735
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

10:14.805 --> 10:18.205
- You're so cuddly! We love you!
- That's it! I am not cuddly!

10:18.275 --> 10:21.645
I'm a vicious jungle animal
from the streets of London!

10:21.715 --> 10:23.845
- Fear me!
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

10:25.515 --> 10:27.575
- Help me!
- Girls! Put him down.

10:27.655 --> 10:28.845
I am not a doll!

10:28.925 --> 10:31.225
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!

10:31.295 --> 10:33.985
Nigel! Get your paws off my girlfriend!

10:34.065 --> 10:36.025
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!

10:40.635 --> 10:41.825
<i>Really nice day!</i>

10:41.905 --> 10:45.735
What is up with
Samson's team tonight? Brutal!

10:45.805 --> 10:47.135
Benny?

10:47.205 --> 10:49.405
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?

10:49.475 --> 10:50.735
I do!

10:51.945 --> 10:53.175
What was that?

10:53.245 --> 10:55.645
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Benny, baby.

10:55.715 --> 10:57.945
<i>- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!</i>

10:58.025 --> 10:59.855
<i>- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!</i>

10:59.925 --> 11:01.615
Cannonball!

11:03.625 --> 11:05.995
Next year, I should just coach.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.555
Check it. The Thomson gazelle.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.435
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.525
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.

11:16.605 --> 11:19.905
Let's get a closer look
at these slim jims.

11:19.975 --> 11:22.465
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.535
Maybe we should just
go to the game.

11:24.615 --> 11:27.885
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.945
Yeah, if he were our age,
he would so be rockin' out with us.

11:31.025 --> 11:33.995
He'd be in there,
runnin' 'em down like they were...

11:34.055 --> 11:37.225
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.

11:37.295 --> 11:38.385
Ready, man?

11:39.195 --> 11:40.185
We'd better not.

11:40.265 --> 11:42.855
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna stop us?

11:42.935 --> 11:45.735
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!

11:45.805 --> 11:48.275
The whole series
comes down to this throw!

11:48.345 --> 11:51.275
There's no tomorrow! It's do or die!

11:51.345 --> 11:52.835
Ya know what I mean.

11:52.915 --> 11:55.905
Guys, I know we're down,
but we're gonna pull this out

11:55.985 --> 11:57.885
'cause we're gonna use...

11:57.955 --> 12:00.515
-...the secret play.
- The secret play!

12:00.585 --> 12:04.785
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!

12:04.855 --> 12:06.885
Larry, the first part of the secret play

12:06.965 --> 12:08.515
is keeping it secret.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.925
- OK.
- Follow my lead.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.625
I'm going to need
a double effort from everybody.

12:12.705 --> 12:15.465
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.095
- Good. Ready, and...
- Break!

12:19.075 --> 12:20.205
Quiet.

12:20.275 --> 12:22.765
On three, dude. One, two...

12:22.845 --> 12:24.245
No!

12:33.485 --> 12:36.185
Now you did it, Ryan.

12:37.195 --> 12:38.785
Feelin' mean, Donald?

12:38.865 --> 12:40.155
Bring it on!

12:40.225 --> 12:42.595
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!

12:42.665 --> 12:44.755
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.

12:44.835 --> 12:47.325
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!

12:47.405 --> 12:52.775
Samson, it's a shame your little brat
isn't here to see you lose.

12:52.845 --> 12:56.435
I can't... hold it!

12:56.515 --> 12:59.575
Oh, no! What are you doin'?

13:02.555 --> 13:05.145
And here comes Samson. Look at that guy.

13:05.225 --> 13:07.195
Is he a beauty or what?

13:07.255 --> 13:09.315
Larry! Bridget! Sweep!

13:09.395 --> 13:10.985
What a recovery!

13:11.065 --> 13:14.035
He's sendin' in Bridget
and Larry to do the job!

13:14.095 --> 13:16.195
Sweep faster, Larry! Sweep, sweep!

13:16.265 --> 13:18.035
- I am!
- Come on, man!

13:18.105 --> 13:20.535
Team Penguin
is sending their ace, Victor...

13:20.605 --> 13:23.265
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.475
Nigel, how are we looking?

13:26.545 --> 13:29.605
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.015
This is cheating
and you will die for this.

13:32.085 --> 13:33.815
I can't hear you, Nigel.

13:33.885 --> 13:36.485
Move left a bit...

13:36.995 --> 13:39.355
OK. Move left and hit!

13:39.425 --> 13:43.055
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!

13:44.495 --> 13:45.865
What a move!

13:50.735 --> 13:53.535
Folks, we are inches away
from the greatest upset

13:53.605 --> 13:55.875
in turtle-curling history!

13:55.945 --> 13:58.415
- Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes!
- No!

13:58.485 --> 14:00.505
Looks like Samson might have choked!

14:02.585 --> 14:04.715
- Nice!
- Yes!

14:04.785 --> 14:06.485
Unbelievable!

14:06.555 --> 14:09.755
Samson and his team
have clinched the title!

14:09.825 --> 14:12.665
- No, wait! I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?

14:12.735 --> 14:16.725
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!

14:16.805 --> 14:20.365
Stampede? Stampede!

14:21.635 --> 14:23.975
Please! Stop!

14:35.625 --> 14:36.845
Watch out!

14:42.325 --> 14:44.765
Dude. Busted.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.555
Catastrophic.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.695
Told you I'd come to the game.

14:48.765 --> 14:50.205
You think this is funny?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.565
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!

14:52.635 --> 14:54.105
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

14:54.175 --> 14:56.765
Chasing the gazelles
or costing us the game?

14:56.845 --> 14:58.865
All you do is sit up
in your tree and sulk.

14:58.945 --> 15:00.915
- If you just...
- What's the problem?

15:00.985 --> 15:02.885
Is all this because you can't roar?

15:06.825 --> 15:08.415
Ryan, I didn't mean that.

15:08.485 --> 15:10.955
Know what I'm doing
when I'm sulking in my tree?

15:11.025 --> 15:14.585
I'm thinking how great it would be
if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.

15:16.035 --> 15:17.155
Ryan, I didn't...

15:17.235 --> 15:20.095
'Cause it would make being
Ryan the Lame a lot easier.

15:20.165 --> 15:22.005
Ryan, I'm sorry.

15:22.075 --> 15:25.565
Ryan! Please don't...

15:25.645 --> 15:27.505
...leave.

15:27.575 --> 15:30.915
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.

15:30.985 --> 15:33.775
And you were worried
he wouldn't show up.

15:38.555 --> 15:41.855
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.

15:43.925 --> 15:46.395
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.

15:46.465 --> 15:49.725
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?

15:49.805 --> 15:53.095
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?

15:53.175 --> 15:55.695
I'm saying you
have to tell him the truth.

15:56.775 --> 15:58.705
I don't think I could do that, Benny.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.365
I mean...

16:00.445 --> 16:03.245
What's he gonna think of me
when he finds out?

16:04.285 --> 16:05.775
I don't know.

16:05.855 --> 16:08.115
But if you don't tell him...

16:08.185 --> 16:10.515
...you're gonna lose him, Sammy.

16:59.175 --> 17:01.405
The green boxes.

18:21.265 --> 18:23.325
OK, they're all loaded up!

18:23.395 --> 18:25.695
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!

18:25.765 --> 18:28.535
I changed my mind! I don't wanna go!

18:29.405 --> 18:30.635
Help!

18:30.705 --> 18:32.295
Ryan.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.865
Help me!

18:35.945 --> 18:37.475
Watch out!

18:38.415 --> 18:40.045
Sam!

18:40.115 --> 18:41.985
- Wait for us!
- Dad!

18:42.055 --> 18:43.955
- Ryan!
- Dad!

18:44.025 --> 18:46.015
Don't let them take me!

18:46.095 --> 18:48.525
- No!
- Ryan!

18:48.595 --> 18:49.585
Help!

18:50.595 --> 18:53.625
- No!
- Dad! Help me!

18:53.695 --> 18:55.565
Ryan!

19:03.745 --> 19:06.715
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.

19:06.775 --> 19:09.335
Get me... the pigeons.

19:12.555 --> 19:14.885
I am wanting snake eyes!

19:14.955 --> 19:16.855
Come on, baby.

19:16.925 --> 19:18.555
Come on, just throw it.

19:24.635 --> 19:25.625
Thanks.

19:26.735 --> 19:30.505
Hamir! You are the
great loser of all time!

19:30.575 --> 19:33.505
What offerings must I make, I wonder?

19:33.575 --> 19:35.165
Hamir! Hamir!

19:35.245 --> 19:37.005
Get a grip on yourself!

19:38.645 --> 19:42.515
Benny! I am needing till Friday
before I am paying you back!

19:42.585 --> 19:44.055
No, no. It's Ryan.

19:44.115 --> 19:47.085
He's in one of those green boxes
and they took it away!

19:47.155 --> 19:48.585
We've got to find him!

19:48.655 --> 19:51.455
That is not good! Not good at all!

19:52.925 --> 19:55.525
I know! I know!

19:55.595 --> 19:58.535
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!

19:59.965 --> 20:02.735
The green boxes go to the big water

20:02.805 --> 20:05.335
where stiff lady
with spikes on her head...

20:05.405 --> 20:08.245
- Hamir? I can't understand...
- Spikes!

20:08.315 --> 20:11.975
Just tell me where the green boxes go.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.485
Stiff lady, spikies?

20:16.685 --> 20:18.315
Yes, like my wife says,

20:18.395 --> 20:22.255
the truck takes them to her! To her!

20:22.325 --> 20:27.955
Though I hate telling bad news,
there is more bad news to tell.

20:28.035 --> 20:33.375
When the sun rises, the green boxes
leave on boat-boat and never return!

20:35.445 --> 20:38.635
I am sorry for this. I really am.

20:40.315 --> 20:41.615
Hello?

20:44.315 --> 20:46.375
No. Not good. Not good.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.255
You always say that.

20:48.325 --> 20:50.725
I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'.

20:50.795 --> 20:52.725
Like a broken record here.

20:52.795 --> 20:54.595
OK. When do we leave, Sammy?

20:54.665 --> 20:55.995
Yeah, when do we leave?

20:56.065 --> 20:59.655
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.

20:59.735 --> 21:02.795
This is now a rescue mission
and I am the only one going.

21:02.875 --> 21:05.335
We'll come too! We're not afraid.

21:05.405 --> 21:06.665
Are we, guys?

21:06.745 --> 21:08.475
Afraid? No.

21:08.545 --> 21:11.275
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."

21:11.345 --> 21:13.045
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.

21:13.115 --> 21:15.675
Not that I'll ever have
one of my own at this rate.

21:15.755 --> 21:18.585
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,

21:18.655 --> 21:21.025
"We will fight them... with peaches."

21:21.795 --> 21:23.485
Yeah. Anyway.

21:23.565 --> 21:27.625
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me? OK.

21:27.695 --> 21:31.155
If you don't mind
being hunted down, shot at...

21:31.235 --> 21:32.865
-...stuffed...
- OK!

21:32.935 --> 21:34.965
...or worse, then fine.

21:35.035 --> 21:38.405
I have a recurring nightmare
about taxidermy and spot remover.

21:38.475 --> 21:42.375
Well, they have to catch us
before they can stuff us and I'm fast.

21:42.445 --> 21:45.545
Nobody's leaving but me. Got it?

21:46.755 --> 21:48.185
- You're the boss.
- You bet.

21:48.255 --> 21:50.015
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.

21:50.085 --> 21:51.715
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.

21:51.795 --> 21:54.255
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.

21:54.325 --> 21:57.195
Now that they're out of the picture,
what's the plan?

22:21.825 --> 22:23.755
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.

22:23.825 --> 22:25.345
I got it all taken care of.

22:25.425 --> 22:28.365
I know this city...

22:28.435 --> 22:29.925
...like the back of my paw.

22:29.995 --> 22:33.395
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue,
couple lefts, couple rights,

22:33.465 --> 22:35.495
bada-boom, past Broadway and...

22:38.505 --> 22:40.035
You're there!

22:45.815 --> 22:47.145
What are you doing here?

22:48.685 --> 22:51.915
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!

22:51.985 --> 22:54.985
She said,
"We're gonna help you find Ryan."

22:55.055 --> 22:56.825
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.

22:56.895 --> 22:59.295
I've got popcorn up my bum.

22:59.365 --> 23:01.195
Do I look trashy in this?

23:02.035 --> 23:03.195
OK, here's my...

23:03.265 --> 23:06.725
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?

23:06.805 --> 23:09.965
I only have until sunrise
before Ryan is taken away forever!

23:10.045 --> 23:12.445
And now I have to worry about you three?

23:13.945 --> 23:16.815
All right, fine. When do we
get off of this thing, Benny?

23:16.885 --> 23:18.215
Benny's here?

23:18.285 --> 23:20.275
Yeah, he's right there.

23:21.355 --> 23:22.515
Benny?

23:23.285 --> 23:24.555
Benny!

23:27.995 --> 23:30.155
Great. Now what am I gonna do?

23:30.235 --> 23:33.295
Guys! Guys! I think we should duck!

23:33.365 --> 23:34.495
What is she saying?

23:34.565 --> 23:37.225
She said, "Duck down!"

23:37.305 --> 23:38.635
Duck!

23:41.545 --> 23:43.805
I am not in the mood
for a game of footsie

23:43.875 --> 23:46.145
or hoofsie or pawsie or...

23:46.215 --> 23:48.375
That wasn't my paw. It was this!

23:50.385 --> 23:52.785
I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

23:52.855 --> 23:55.845
It'll light the way to Ryan.

24:59.925 --> 25:01.185
The walls are moving.

25:01.265 --> 25:02.925
Right, right. The walls...

25:02.995 --> 25:04.295
The walls are moving!

25:04.365 --> 25:06.385
Larry, hold your breath!

25:09.605 --> 25:10.765
Larry, stay straight!

25:12.805 --> 25:14.105
Everybody out!

25:14.175 --> 25:16.605
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...

25:22.715 --> 25:25.085
This is definitely not good. Samson!

25:25.155 --> 25:28.055
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!

25:28.125 --> 25:29.425
Larry!

25:33.365 --> 25:35.155
The garbage! It lives!

25:40.705 --> 25:41.965
Guys?

25:42.035 --> 25:44.435
OK, anybody? I'm freakin' out.

25:45.775 --> 25:48.105
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?

25:49.375 --> 25:50.935
We're over here, Nigel.

25:51.015 --> 25:52.945
Right. I'll be there in a minute.

25:53.015 --> 25:55.285
Think. What did Benny say?

25:55.355 --> 25:58.585
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.

25:58.655 --> 26:00.485
Bridget, can you see the green lady?

26:00.555 --> 26:02.525
I'm looking, I'm looking,

26:02.595 --> 26:05.425
but I can't see over anything
for a change.

26:05.495 --> 26:08.195
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?

26:08.265 --> 26:10.095
Is that you, Larry?

26:10.165 --> 26:11.325
Up here, Nige.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.805
You're a very furry snake.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.805
Guys... We don't want
to draw attention to ourselves.

26:21.685 --> 26:24.775
Dogs. This should be fun
for you, Samson.

26:24.855 --> 26:26.445
Nigel! Grab Bridget!

26:26.515 --> 26:28.715
- What?
- Run!

26:31.725 --> 26:34.195
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

26:34.265 --> 26:36.995
Shouldn't you be
tearing them to shreds?

26:37.065 --> 26:41.295
All part of the plan. This maneuver's
known as the Serengeti Slip.

26:41.365 --> 26:43.895
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.

26:48.505 --> 26:49.495
What next?

26:51.115 --> 26:52.775
Page 11?

26:54.715 --> 26:56.305
Go on, you mutts!

26:56.385 --> 26:58.715
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.

27:01.295 --> 27:03.815
Taken you to a... To a disco!

27:05.065 --> 27:06.185
Larry, improvise!

27:08.265 --> 27:10.525
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.

27:10.605 --> 27:13.895
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!

27:13.975 --> 27:16.135
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.

27:16.205 --> 27:18.735
You're a lion. Be a lion.

27:20.815 --> 27:22.805
Look at that guy!

27:24.615 --> 27:26.775
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.

27:28.085 --> 27:30.175
OK...

27:30.255 --> 27:31.985
- Larry, coil!
- Check!

27:38.365 --> 27:41.355
- Sam!
- I improvised. Now jump!

27:41.435 --> 27:42.765
- Down there?
- Yes!

27:46.875 --> 27:48.845
We're leaving, Larry!

28:06.265 --> 28:09.755
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there,

28:09.835 --> 28:12.825
why didn't you just do
what you did in the wild?

28:12.905 --> 28:14.895
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them

28:14.965 --> 28:16.565
or lionify them?

28:16.635 --> 28:19.005
I don't have time
to fight dogs, Bridget.

28:19.075 --> 28:21.265
We have to find Ryan, remember?

28:21.345 --> 28:23.435
What is this stinky place?

28:23.515 --> 28:25.675
It...

28:25.745 --> 28:27.805
...appears to be a human bathing area.

28:27.885 --> 28:30.815
You mean humans
don't lick themselves clean?

28:30.885 --> 28:32.355
Disgusting!

28:32.425 --> 28:36.285
They're hopeless. It is hard to believe
they are at the top of the food chain.

28:36.355 --> 28:40.125
I can't imagine beginning the day
without licking myself.

28:40.195 --> 28:42.685
No hurry, but is there a plan?

28:42.765 --> 28:45.165
Of course there's a plan.

28:45.235 --> 28:47.635
We follow this water to the big water,

28:47.705 --> 28:49.765
and then we find the lady with...

28:53.415 --> 28:57.435
Larry, either your stomach is growling
or something in it is growling.

28:57.515 --> 28:59.175
Wasn't me.

29:01.315 --> 29:02.915
What?

29:08.595 --> 29:12.695
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy! Twins!

29:12.765 --> 29:15.235
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now,
'cause these guys

29:15.305 --> 29:17.765
are seeming to have acid reflux
or something!

29:17.835 --> 29:20.395
Everybody... stay calm.

29:20.475 --> 29:22.035
- Calm?
- Not good.

29:26.245 --> 29:28.005
Yo. Boo!

29:29.615 --> 29:32.345
I'm gonna say,
it looks like you and your crew here

29:32.415 --> 29:34.285
are a little far from your borough.

29:36.425 --> 29:38.155
Far from your borough! I love it.

29:38.225 --> 29:39.885
We're going to the big water.

29:39.965 --> 29:42.365
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.

29:44.165 --> 29:46.495
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.

29:50.175 --> 29:53.075
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.

29:53.145 --> 29:55.935
- No idea. You?
- Doesn't even register.

29:56.015 --> 29:58.605
- You're battin' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...

29:59.385 --> 30:01.685
Make your bloody mind up.

30:02.655 --> 30:05.555
The big female
with the spikes on her melon!

30:05.625 --> 30:06.955
They're tourists.

30:07.025 --> 30:10.585
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.

30:10.665 --> 30:12.525
First take the Broadway culvert.

30:12.595 --> 30:15.795
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?

30:15.865 --> 30:18.525
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!

30:18.605 --> 30:21.075
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?

30:21.135 --> 30:22.695
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!

30:22.775 --> 30:25.605
The Wall Street culvert
is blocked with construction.

30:25.675 --> 30:27.235
- That is true.
- All right.

30:27.315 --> 30:28.875
Guys, you gonna help or not?

30:28.945 --> 30:31.675
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.

30:31.745 --> 30:33.945
We're one big family, right?

30:34.015 --> 30:36.285
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...

30:36.355 --> 30:39.915
You done runnin' your mouth yet,
Carmine? Are ya?

30:39.995 --> 30:43.725
I apologize. He never got over
being flushed down the toilet.

30:44.765 --> 30:45.755
Yeah.

30:45.835 --> 30:49.495
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last
ten minutes in this neighborhood.

30:49.565 --> 30:51.005
It's a jungle down here.

30:51.075 --> 30:53.365
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What? No.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.845
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!

30:55.905 --> 30:58.575
How ya doing?

30:58.645 --> 31:00.845
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

31:03.045 --> 31:06.145
I've seen a lot of those things
floatin' here in the sewer.

31:07.385 --> 31:10.115
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.

31:10.195 --> 31:12.185
Just wait for me!

31:21.065 --> 31:22.795
Are we in the right place?

31:22.875 --> 31:25.275
Any place without
two hilarious alligators

31:25.345 --> 31:27.275
seems a move in the right direction.

31:27.345 --> 31:32.215
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.

31:33.615 --> 31:36.745
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.

31:36.815 --> 31:40.845
And it's sunrise,
which means we're a tad short on time.

31:40.925 --> 31:43.295
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.

31:43.365 --> 31:45.985
It's gotta be around here,
so I need you to...

31:46.065 --> 31:48.395
Yeah. So we should
shout out if we see a box

31:48.465 --> 31:50.625
that looks like the ones over there.

31:51.905 --> 31:54.025
It hasn't left yet! We can make it!

31:54.105 --> 31:56.005
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!

32:00.315 --> 32:02.875
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?

32:03.985 --> 32:06.315
Run!

32:11.955 --> 32:13.545
No!

32:13.625 --> 32:15.215
No!

32:15.295 --> 32:16.885
Ryan's on that thing!

32:16.965 --> 32:18.525
We've got to stop it!

32:18.595 --> 32:20.725
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!

32:20.805 --> 32:23.295
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!

32:30.215 --> 32:32.945
I failed. Again.

32:33.015 --> 32:35.145
I only count one failure.

32:35.215 --> 32:37.845
It's big, but it's just one.

32:37.915 --> 32:41.945
Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya.

32:44.695 --> 32:47.785
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?

32:47.865 --> 32:51.955
It's a human and I do not
think he works for the zoo.

32:52.035 --> 32:54.595
Perhaps now
is a good time to improvise.

32:54.675 --> 32:56.005
What?

33:02.575 --> 33:05.515
Great! One problem down...

33:05.615 --> 33:07.045
Far out.

33:07.115 --> 33:08.645
Cool.

33:09.785 --> 33:11.585
One disaster to go.

33:19.735 --> 33:22.495
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!

33:22.565 --> 33:24.725
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?

33:24.805 --> 33:27.495
None of us. We're animals. Great!

33:39.855 --> 33:42.445
- Hold on, Larry. Do that again.
- Do what?

33:42.525 --> 33:44.645
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!

33:44.725 --> 33:47.315
But I don't know my opposites!

33:48.225 --> 33:49.755
No, Larry, like this!

33:58.775 --> 34:00.745
I think I've got it.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.005
Well, that was easy.

34:05.985 --> 34:09.275
Oh, dear. Has anyone
got any eucalyptus wipes?

34:09.355 --> 34:11.514
This isn't so difficult.

34:11.585 --> 34:14.574
I'm the lion of the sea!

34:15.695 --> 34:17.185
Well done, sir.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.455
Captain of our team
and now captain of this vessel.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.554
You're brilliant.

34:21.635 --> 34:26.395
I hate to be Miss Negative,
but in this melee,

34:26.465 --> 34:28.405
we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.

34:28.475 --> 34:32.605
- What, nothing?
- Nothing. He's gone.

34:34.275 --> 34:35.605
No.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.145
There! Nelson! The green boxes!

34:47.225 --> 34:49.525
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!

34:49.594 --> 34:51.685
And my love!

34:51.764 --> 34:55.165
Let's go in!

34:56.364 --> 34:59.825
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun. To the north.

34:59.905 --> 35:01.965
Starboard... Leftboard.

35:02.045 --> 35:03.705
Just follow my finger.

35:03.775 --> 35:05.975
Please. You guys
wouldn't know the answer

35:06.045 --> 35:08.445
if it fell from the sky
and hit you in the head.

35:08.515 --> 35:10.505
Oh, my! It's a bat! It's a bat!

35:10.585 --> 35:12.575
Get it off me! Get it off me!

35:14.755 --> 35:16.685
- Benny!
- Benny?

35:16.755 --> 35:17.985
Geese!

35:19.495 --> 35:22.925
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.

35:24.195 --> 35:25.685
Benny, you made it!

35:27.005 --> 35:30.635
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.

35:30.705 --> 35:32.635
Even not-so-best friends,

35:32.705 --> 35:35.145
who knock you off
a speeding garbage truck.

35:35.205 --> 35:38.375
Excuse me, but I begged them
to go back and get you.

35:38.445 --> 35:39.435
Just so you know.

35:39.515 --> 35:42.485
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat
from up there?

35:42.555 --> 35:45.615
Well, it just so happens
I saw it heading that way.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.155
And we're in luck!

35:47.225 --> 35:50.155
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!

35:50.225 --> 35:53.095
Experts at intercontinental travel.

35:53.165 --> 35:54.825
Hey, birdie, OK,

35:54.895 --> 35:59.735
is it true that Canada has lax
immigration policies for koalas?

35:59.805 --> 36:02.205
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.

36:02.275 --> 36:05.505
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?

36:05.575 --> 36:08.515
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.

36:08.575 --> 36:11.705
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?

36:13.385 --> 36:15.875
Hey, Benny, thanks.

36:15.955 --> 36:21.825
And FYl, Bridget was very concerned
when you fell off the truck.

36:26.065 --> 36:29.865
Bet you didn't know
I could ride geese, did you?

36:29.935 --> 36:32.305
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.

36:35.275 --> 36:38.475
Sammy? We going to the wild now?

36:38.545 --> 36:41.205
I think we are, Larry.

37:42.415 --> 37:44.745
I can't take it anymore.

37:44.815 --> 37:46.755
He's taunting us! Listen!

37:48.825 --> 37:51.755
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!

37:51.825 --> 37:55.415
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?

37:55.495 --> 37:57.795
The crew,
they're on the verge of mutiny.

37:57.865 --> 37:58.955
Nigel, please.

37:59.035 --> 38:01.555
If you don't give us
ice creams pretty quick,

38:01.635 --> 38:03.365
you're gonna walk the plank, sir!

38:03.435 --> 38:05.425
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,

38:05.505 --> 38:08.095
I'm getting off this
death cruise right now.

38:11.375 --> 38:15.045
Iceberg! Permission
to go down with the ship, sir.

38:15.115 --> 38:16.875
Hang on! Stuff that!

38:16.955 --> 38:20.215
Run! Swim!

38:20.285 --> 38:21.415
Nigel?

38:21.485 --> 38:24.785
Look, I'm a starfish.

38:24.855 --> 38:26.985
Guys, look.

38:27.065 --> 38:30.515
Gosh. Must feel like a lifetime
since you've been here.

38:30.595 --> 38:33.535
Yeah... a lifetime.

38:45.285 --> 38:46.615
What the heck?

38:46.685 --> 38:48.915
Wow! Look!

38:48.985 --> 38:52.385
They're releasing the green boxes
back into the wild.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.645
- Larry.
- Guys,

38:53.725 --> 38:56.245
they're putting animals
inside the green boxes.

38:56.325 --> 38:58.455
I just can't figure out why.

38:58.525 --> 39:01.555
It's a tunnel to another dimension,
can't you see?

39:01.635 --> 39:03.425
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?

39:03.505 --> 39:04.765
It's all right, Nigel.

39:04.835 --> 39:07.235
Think it has anything to do with that?

39:08.235 --> 39:12.105
Hang on a second. Either I'm starving
or Larry is making sense.

39:12.175 --> 39:15.575
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.365
Ryan?

39:33.795 --> 39:35.135
Ryan!

39:38.275 --> 39:39.495
Oh, no!

39:40.505 --> 39:41.495
Ryan!

39:44.915 --> 39:46.575
We've got to move fast!

39:46.645 --> 39:48.375
Ryan!

39:51.685 --> 39:54.085
Ryan! Ryan!

39:56.755 --> 39:59.425
Ryan! Where are you, buddy?

40:01.765 --> 40:03.355
Ryan!

40:03.435 --> 40:05.125
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!

40:05.195 --> 40:07.495
I was so close. He was right there!

40:07.565 --> 40:09.735
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!

40:09.805 --> 40:14.075
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.635
I don't want to run anymore.

40:15.715 --> 40:18.275
Good. 'Cause frankly,
you need a good sports bra.

40:18.345 --> 40:20.315
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.285
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.

40:23.355 --> 40:25.285
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?

40:25.355 --> 40:26.785
I mean, he got it! Let's go!

40:26.855 --> 40:29.185
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!

40:29.795 --> 40:32.455
I'm not designed for this! I want a car.

40:35.195 --> 40:38.065
Hey, guys, I found him! Ryan!

40:39.905 --> 40:41.535
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

40:41.605 --> 40:43.875
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?

40:43.945 --> 40:47.935
Yeah, now that I think about it,
he did come through here. Hello?

40:48.015 --> 40:50.915
Come on out, baby lion! Your dad's here!

40:50.985 --> 40:54.245
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!

40:56.855 --> 41:00.085
Funky. I was under the impression
you had Ryan's scent,

41:00.155 --> 41:02.655
not this olfactory insult.

41:02.725 --> 41:03.885
I...

41:03.965 --> 41:07.865
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator
instincts must've kicked in since,

41:07.935 --> 41:09.925
you know, I haven't eaten for a while.

41:10.005 --> 41:11.435
Exactly!

41:11.505 --> 41:14.305
You never know when those
instincts are gonna kick in.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.965
Excellent. Fantastic!

41:16.045 --> 41:17.905
We get to see the legend in action.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.035
I'd love to,
but we just don't have time.

41:20.115 --> 41:23.375
We got the time, Sammy. Just...

41:23.455 --> 41:25.715
And then you do this. And then this bit.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.615
Rip him apart!

41:29.455 --> 41:31.115
The horror.

41:38.165 --> 41:41.365
I can't bear to watch! But I have to.

41:44.205 --> 41:46.535
Go on. Get out of here.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.805
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.

41:48.875 --> 41:51.605
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?

41:51.685 --> 41:54.985
No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts.

41:55.055 --> 41:57.745
Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me?

41:57.825 --> 42:00.885
Beat me up a little,
then pounce when I get my hopes up?

42:00.955 --> 42:02.655
How exciting.

42:02.725 --> 42:04.555
Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far.

42:04.625 --> 42:08.295
Hey! I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.

42:08.365 --> 42:10.355
My flesh has fruity wood notes!

42:10.435 --> 42:14.205
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.

42:14.275 --> 42:15.795
You call this wild?

42:15.875 --> 42:19.205
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!

42:19.275 --> 42:23.185
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!

42:23.245 --> 42:26.085
Maybe I should hide
behind the koala for protection.

42:26.155 --> 42:28.775
While we're at it,
could you slap me in the face?

42:28.855 --> 42:30.255
No. What are you, a twit?

42:30.325 --> 42:32.725
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother! I'm leaving.

42:32.795 --> 42:34.915
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!

42:34.995 --> 42:37.085
It's a lion with moral issues!

42:37.965 --> 42:40.265
And I've had it with you too!

42:40.335 --> 42:41.995
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!

42:42.805 --> 42:44.925
Teensy question.

42:45.005 --> 42:48.335
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.

42:48.405 --> 42:50.205
That hyrax back there?

42:50.275 --> 42:52.545
It was sort of like
you couldn't eat him.

42:52.615 --> 42:57.055
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.

42:57.115 --> 42:59.985
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that you're...

43:00.055 --> 43:01.485
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.

43:01.555 --> 43:04.615
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...

43:04.695 --> 43:07.895
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...

43:07.965 --> 43:09.765
The wild?

43:12.035 --> 43:15.865
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.

43:15.935 --> 43:17.375
What?

43:18.645 --> 43:20.435
I'm just a phony.

43:21.615 --> 43:24.245
Truth is I can't protect you out here.

43:25.985 --> 43:27.785
Please just go back to the boat.

43:28.985 --> 43:31.115
I've got to find my son.

43:32.525 --> 43:36.985
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle
with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.

43:37.065 --> 43:39.995
Actually, I'm nine inches,
but other than that, yes.

43:40.065 --> 43:41.995
So that means...

43:42.065 --> 43:44.465
We are going to die!

43:46.735 --> 43:48.675
Hey, guys! Guys!

43:51.575 --> 43:53.445
Will the three of you calm down?

43:53.515 --> 43:54.945
How could he lie to us?

43:55.015 --> 43:56.675
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.

43:56.745 --> 43:59.615
Maybe he lied 'cause he
didn't want to tell us the truth.

44:00.485 --> 44:02.145
OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever.

44:02.225 --> 44:04.345
Let's just go back to the boat, then.

44:04.425 --> 44:07.865
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!

44:07.925 --> 44:10.525
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Where you goin'?

44:10.595 --> 44:13.065
Stop right there! Stop!

44:13.135 --> 44:16.065
Bridget, if you go, I'm...

44:16.135 --> 44:18.075
I'm breaking up with you.

44:18.135 --> 44:20.305
We were never going out
in the first place.

44:20.375 --> 44:21.865
Then we're taking a break.

44:21.945 --> 44:23.435
- Nigel!
- All right!

44:25.215 --> 44:27.275
Hey, listen!

44:27.885 --> 44:30.715
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.

44:30.785 --> 44:34.315
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.

44:34.385 --> 44:37.055
And... so is Ryan.

44:41.595 --> 44:44.125
OK, OK, focus, Samson.

44:44.205 --> 44:47.795
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.

44:47.875 --> 44:51.395
I mean, how big
can this place be, anyway?

44:59.555 --> 45:02.485
Ryan!

45:17.465 --> 45:19.995
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?

45:21.505 --> 45:24.905
You remind me
of my buddy back home.

45:24.975 --> 45:28.605
A bloodthirsty monster!

45:28.685 --> 45:29.945
Where? Where?

45:30.015 --> 45:32.645
He's a killer! Get away from my baby!

45:34.525 --> 45:35.855
Calm down, lady!

45:35.925 --> 45:39.325
Won't anyone save my baby?

45:41.365 --> 45:43.055
Bye-bye.

45:47.335 --> 45:49.595
Ryan! Ryan!

45:49.675 --> 45:50.935
Sammy!

45:51.005 --> 45:53.475
I wasn't meant for the wild.

45:53.545 --> 45:56.165
I was made to nibble and be elegant

45:56.245 --> 45:58.875
and to appear in children's books
as the letter G.

45:58.945 --> 46:01.045
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?

46:01.115 --> 46:03.715
It's just leaves and vines and...

46:04.385 --> 46:06.145
Oh, that's my foot.

46:06.225 --> 46:08.285
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.

46:08.355 --> 46:10.625
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.

46:11.995 --> 46:14.425
Oh, I see. All right, OK, yeah.

46:14.495 --> 46:18.455
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.

46:18.535 --> 46:20.465
Nigel! I gave you an order.

46:20.535 --> 46:23.505
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?

46:23.575 --> 46:24.905
Nigel.

46:26.745 --> 46:28.105
That's not funny, Nigel.

46:28.175 --> 46:30.575
- He's gone! We're doomed.
- Nigel!

46:30.645 --> 46:34.585
First Ryan, then Samson,
and now Nigel!

46:34.655 --> 46:36.215
I do believe in zoos.

46:36.285 --> 46:38.655
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.

46:38.725 --> 46:41.455
- Don't panic. I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!

46:41.525 --> 46:43.685
I say we fan out and circle.

46:43.765 --> 46:46.695
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.

46:46.765 --> 46:48.425
Run for your lives, everybody!

46:48.505 --> 46:52.525
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?

46:54.575 --> 46:58.135
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.

46:58.215 --> 47:01.305
That means they don't hunt. They graze.

47:01.585 --> 47:03.315
But they're licking their chops.

47:03.385 --> 47:05.615
I'll take the one with the funny knees.

47:05.685 --> 47:08.125
The funny knee...?

47:08.185 --> 47:10.055
Benny, no!

47:16.435 --> 47:17.525
Benny?

47:18.565 --> 47:20.295
Get them.

47:21.235 --> 47:24.175
Just, hey, back off. I'm sorry,

47:24.235 --> 47:26.905
I'm not that kind of koala bear.

47:29.745 --> 47:30.975
Right.

47:35.285 --> 47:38.375
Excuse me? Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you,

47:38.455 --> 47:41.255
<i>but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?</i>

47:43.795 --> 47:45.125
Right.

47:49.735 --> 47:53.435
Could you possibly not go
towards the big smoking thing?

47:54.305 --> 47:56.775
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

47:56.845 --> 47:59.465
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

47:59.545 --> 48:01.345
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

48:01.415 --> 48:04.545
What a strange place for a party.

48:12.855 --> 48:14.685
Very good, very organized.

48:16.625 --> 48:18.395
Can I use your toilet?

48:19.965 --> 48:21.265
<i>I'm having a</i>

48:21.335 --> 48:23.065
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

48:23.135 --> 48:25.165
<i>Really nice day</i>

48:25.235 --> 48:26.365
<i>I'm having a</i>

48:26.435 --> 48:28.275
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

48:28.345 --> 48:30.075
<i>Really nice day</i>

48:30.145 --> 48:33.205
<i>- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away</i>

48:33.275 --> 48:38.085
They're frighteningly
horrible monster beasts...

48:38.155 --> 48:39.885
...but they're not bad dancers.

48:39.955 --> 48:42.425
<i>I'm so cuddly
I like you</i>

48:42.495 --> 48:44.955
<i>I'm so cuddly
I like you</i>

48:45.025 --> 48:48.825
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

48:48.895 --> 48:50.955
<i>- I'm having a
- Really nice day</i>

48:51.035 --> 48:52.325
Oh, no!

48:52.405 --> 48:55.305
<i>Tickle away
Tickle away</i>

48:55.375 --> 48:57.775
<i>I'm so cuddly, I like you
Good day</i>

48:59.405 --> 49:02.305
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.

49:02.375 --> 49:04.645
Leader. Prophet.

49:04.715 --> 49:06.445
Choreographer.

49:07.515 --> 49:10.285
And with your help... carnivore!

49:10.355 --> 49:14.625
No! Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!

49:14.695 --> 49:16.355
This is not fair.

49:28.305 --> 49:31.905
Oh, I get it. A yoga retreat.

49:34.045 --> 49:35.705
Ryan!

49:37.845 --> 49:41.085
You can do this. Use your instincts.

49:50.225 --> 49:52.215
Follow your instincts.

50:03.175 --> 50:04.605
Use your instincts.

50:05.705 --> 50:07.375
OK.

50:07.445 --> 50:09.375
Down this way.

50:11.545 --> 50:13.715
This way.

50:40.545 --> 50:42.485
A lion cub.

50:43.315 --> 50:45.545
We must tell Kazar.

50:47.285 --> 50:49.775
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.

50:49.855 --> 50:51.555
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

50:55.695 --> 50:59.725
Thank you very much,
but I'm afraid I've got to run.

50:59.805 --> 51:01.235
Koalas are very busy bees.

51:01.305 --> 51:03.775
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...

51:03.835 --> 51:06.035
For centuries,
we've watched our brethren

51:06.105 --> 51:08.545
perish at the claw of the lion.

51:08.615 --> 51:12.305
Today, we put our hooves down.

51:12.385 --> 51:17.345
No longer will we dwell
at the bottom of the food chain.

51:17.425 --> 51:20.755
Well, yes. I should say so.

51:20.825 --> 51:25.195
There were those who doubted
that you'd arrive to lead us.

51:25.665 --> 51:28.325
But I always believed in the Omen.

51:28.395 --> 51:32.065
The Omen! Right. Remind me again?

51:32.135 --> 51:34.405
Sent down by the gods years ago...

51:36.405 --> 51:39.395
Oh, no! Not you!

51:55.125 --> 51:57.425
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

52:03.475 --> 52:04.765
Oh, Great Him,

52:04.835 --> 52:08.965
you must lead us
in our transformation from prey...

52:10.645 --> 52:12.335
...to predator.

52:12.775 --> 52:16.445
Hold it. I am the Great Him?

52:18.215 --> 52:21.085
- The Great Him?
- Him.

52:22.455 --> 52:26.955
So this is all your fault!
That's it! You...!

52:27.025 --> 52:29.055
- Kazar!
- Kazar! Don't listen to him!

52:29.135 --> 52:31.565
- Kazar! Over here!
- Kazar! Over here!

52:31.635 --> 52:34.795
How dare you interrupt my audience
with the Great Him!

52:34.875 --> 52:38.235
But... but we found a lion cub!

52:39.645 --> 52:41.575
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?

52:41.645 --> 52:44.115
With big hair? Well, a mullet, really.

52:44.185 --> 52:47.675
Oh, Great Him,
you brought two lions with you?

52:47.755 --> 52:50.015
Well, like any Great Him,

52:50.085 --> 52:52.525
I travel with an entourage.

52:53.255 --> 52:57.025
Worry not, Your Himness,
I shall have Blag bring the lions here.

52:57.095 --> 53:01.655
And he better not screw this up,
like you screwed up my dance number!

53:01.735 --> 53:03.855
I lost count for one verse.

53:03.935 --> 53:06.305
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

53:07.235 --> 53:10.935
Why do we even bother rehearsing?

53:12.115 --> 53:14.635
A good chorus line
is so hard to put together.

53:17.385 --> 53:18.785
Take to the skies!

53:18.855 --> 53:20.785
We're taking! We're taking!

53:22.925 --> 53:25.515
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

53:25.595 --> 53:28.325
Bring us those lions!

53:31.795 --> 53:36.165
The gods celebrate
the fulfillment of the prophecy.

53:36.235 --> 53:38.835
We stamp our hooves

53:38.905 --> 53:41.735
in praise of the Great Him!

53:41.805 --> 53:43.635
Holy moly!

53:43.715 --> 53:45.905
<i>Holy moly
Holy moly</i>

53:45.975 --> 53:49.175
You are our king!

54:05.105 --> 54:08.395
Looky, looky who's there.

54:09.475 --> 54:10.735
Surprise!

54:13.345 --> 54:14.705
No!

54:16.745 --> 54:18.715
Sorry we're late for dinner!

54:27.725 --> 54:29.125
That's pathetic!

54:31.595 --> 54:32.755
Get off!

54:32.835 --> 54:34.795
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!

54:38.105 --> 54:40.295
- Ryan!
- No!

54:41.645 --> 54:43.365
I'm coming, son!

54:45.015 --> 54:46.705
Dad?

54:46.775 --> 54:48.645
- Help!
- Let's scram!

54:48.715 --> 54:50.615
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?

54:50.685 --> 54:53.315
- I can't believe it! I found you.
- How'd you find me?

54:53.385 --> 54:55.415
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

54:55.485 --> 54:57.425
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.

54:57.495 --> 54:58.825
It's OK, son.

54:58.895 --> 55:01.515
And then I escaped,
and I ran into the jungle...

55:01.595 --> 55:04.295
...then those vultures came
and tried to kill me.

55:04.365 --> 55:06.995
You wouldn't have been scared. I was.

55:07.065 --> 55:09.435
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

55:10.005 --> 55:11.475
Listen.

55:12.975 --> 55:14.565
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!

55:15.205 --> 55:16.835
Run!

55:17.515 --> 55:20.005
Dad, you should be chasing them!

55:20.085 --> 55:22.485
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!

55:22.555 --> 55:24.885
But now's your chance
to show me for real!

55:28.655 --> 55:30.415
This way!

55:33.825 --> 55:38.395
- Dad? What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!

55:44.905 --> 55:47.065
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?

55:47.145 --> 55:49.165
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!

55:49.245 --> 55:50.875
You could kick their rumps!

55:50.945 --> 55:54.505
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens! Get back here!

55:54.585 --> 55:56.675
Ryan! I can't fight them.

55:57.585 --> 55:59.355
What do you mean?

56:01.425 --> 56:03.515
I was young...

56:03.595 --> 56:05.725
...still just a cub.

56:06.665 --> 56:08.925
Ladies and gentlemen.

56:09.005 --> 56:11.165
Children of all ages.

56:11.235 --> 56:14.565
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!

56:14.645 --> 56:18.575
Witness the greatest day
in our young lion's life!

56:18.645 --> 56:22.545
The day he discovers his roar!

56:22.615 --> 56:24.315
Dad, I can't do it!

56:24.385 --> 56:25.875
Now, go!

56:25.955 --> 56:29.855
Listen as Samson
unleashes a roar so mighty,

56:29.925 --> 56:33.385
it launches a wildebeest
clear off the savannah!

56:37.895 --> 56:40.365
Samson! Dig deep!

56:52.615 --> 56:54.105
I should have known.

56:54.185 --> 56:58.245
If you'd been born in the wild,
you'd know how to roar.

56:58.585 --> 56:59.645
Dad?

57:00.785 --> 57:03.385
Dad! Dad!

57:03.455 --> 57:05.395
Please!

57:08.195 --> 57:09.665
Dad.

57:09.735 --> 57:12.795
When they shipped me to the zoo,
I never wanted anyone to know

57:12.865 --> 57:17.105
where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.

57:17.175 --> 57:19.265
I should have told you sooner.

57:19.345 --> 57:22.775
But... all those stories you tell?

57:22.845 --> 57:25.745
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

57:25.815 --> 57:28.845
Everything you told me was a lie?

57:30.985 --> 57:33.385
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.

57:34.325 --> 57:36.295
Help!

57:36.395 --> 57:38.325
Ryan!

57:39.965 --> 57:42.095
Ryan! Run!

57:44.475 --> 57:46.495
Not so fast, Tigger.

57:48.175 --> 57:49.905
Dad!

57:51.775 --> 57:53.745
Ryan!

57:53.815 --> 57:55.245
Dad!

57:57.685 --> 58:00.585
- Help!
- Ryan.

58:00.655 --> 58:02.645
Help! Dad!

58:02.725 --> 58:05.785
- Ryan.
- Dad! Help me!

58:15.305 --> 58:16.735
What?

58:19.045 --> 58:21.035
Wait! What? What? Wait!

58:21.105 --> 58:23.375
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey!

58:26.785 --> 58:27.905
Get off me!

58:28.655 --> 58:30.045
What is goin' on here?

58:30.115 --> 58:34.145
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.

58:34.225 --> 58:36.025
Wait. You guys think I'm a...?

58:36.095 --> 58:39.115
<i>- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.</i>

58:39.195 --> 58:41.165
<i>- Ja.
- Roll! Roll!</i>

58:41.235 --> 58:43.325
What the...? Hey!

58:43.395 --> 58:46.065
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!

58:46.135 --> 58:48.195
I'll give you something to roll about!

58:51.745 --> 58:54.145
It's a good thing
Bridget didn't see that!

58:54.215 --> 58:57.205
Bridget? Larry! They're gone.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.515
I gotta find them!

58:59.585 --> 59:02.175
No! I gotta find Samson first!

59:02.255 --> 59:03.725
No! First...

59:08.025 --> 59:10.085
Sam. Sam!

59:22.805 --> 59:24.405
Bridget! Larry!

59:24.475 --> 59:26.245
Oh, Ryan! You're alive!

59:26.315 --> 59:28.305
Good to see you guys.

59:28.385 --> 59:30.855
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.

59:30.915 --> 59:33.685
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.

59:35.455 --> 59:37.115
What are you guys doing here?

59:37.195 --> 59:39.455
We came here
with your father to find you.

59:39.525 --> 59:43.015
And he's probably out there
right now lookin' for us.

59:44.195 --> 59:45.995
I wish he were.

59:46.065 --> 59:48.835
But some of these wildebeests
pushed him off a cliff.

59:48.905 --> 59:50.465
- What?
- What?

59:50.535 --> 59:53.945
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.

59:54.005 --> 59:55.905
Oh, Ryan.

59:55.975 --> 59:58.245
I'm sorry I got you into this.

59:58.315 --> 01:00:02.045
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased
with what I brought you.

01:00:02.115 --> 01:00:04.585
What's this? Where's the other lion?

01:00:04.655 --> 01:00:08.355
Right. Well, I was gonna tell you,
there was this cliff and...

01:00:09.825 --> 01:00:12.695
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:16.495
That's twice you've been
out of step today, Blag!

01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:17.825
You klutz.

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:20.565
You know we can't ascend
to the top of the food chain

01:00:20.635 --> 01:00:23.695
until we eat a lion!

01:00:25.345 --> 01:00:28.335
Well, at least there'll
be enough for my ascension.

01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:29.935
What about the rest of us?

01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:32.845
Step-kick, pivot-kick!

01:00:38.325 --> 01:00:40.485
Ouch! I twisted a hoof!

01:00:40.555 --> 01:00:43.725
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.

01:00:43.795 --> 01:00:48.135
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:53.635
Why did I let him go off by himself?

01:00:53.705 --> 01:00:57.805
He couldn't catch a cold,
much less his own lunch.

01:00:59.415 --> 01:01:01.005
Bet I could catch you.

01:01:01.085 --> 01:01:02.415
Please.

01:01:02.485 --> 01:01:05.615
My natural predator
is fuel inject... What?

01:01:05.685 --> 01:01:08.955
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!

01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:12.355
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?

01:01:13.695 --> 01:01:15.285
I lost Ryan.

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:18.665
There were too many. They just took him.

01:01:18.735 --> 01:01:21.395
Who? Who took him?

01:01:21.475 --> 01:01:25.035
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!

01:01:25.105 --> 01:01:26.975
They got Larry and Bridget too.

01:01:27.045 --> 01:01:30.305
Couldn't fight, couldn't...

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.975
Come on, Sam. You're a lion.

01:01:32.045 --> 01:01:34.175
You come from a long line of kings.

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:36.515
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.

01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:38.575
But fighting's in your blood!

01:01:38.655 --> 01:01:42.095
No. I'll never be a real lion.

01:01:42.155 --> 01:01:45.065
Wrong! You are a real lion.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.025
Doesn't matter where you're from:

01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:49.935
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.

01:01:50.005 --> 01:01:51.935
It's what's in here.

01:01:52.005 --> 01:01:54.305
That determines who you are!

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.865
At least, that's what you
always told your son.

01:01:56.945 --> 01:01:59.435
Now he's out there, Sammy,

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:02.535
and he needs you.

01:02:02.615 --> 01:02:05.135
Who else is gonna
teach him how to roar?

01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:10.955
That's it, Sammy.

01:02:16.325 --> 01:02:17.595
That's it.

01:02:23.165 --> 01:02:26.905
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:29.565
Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us!

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:33.045
Except that we have no idea
where we're going!

01:02:34.145 --> 01:02:35.805
Follow your instincts.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.545
Follow your instincts.

01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:41.885
- What is that?
- My... instincts?

01:02:45.825 --> 01:02:48.455
- Benny?
- You're almost there.

01:02:49.865 --> 01:02:51.125
That settles it, then.

01:02:51.195 --> 01:02:54.865
My mother definitely drank pool water
when she was pregnant with me.

01:02:54.935 --> 01:02:56.465
Benny, look.

01:02:56.535 --> 01:02:58.905
The freaks with hooves!

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.305
Ryan's in there.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.735
You can't just barge in. That's suicide!

01:03:03.815 --> 01:03:07.345
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.

01:03:07.415 --> 01:03:10.405
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.

01:03:10.485 --> 01:03:13.945
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!

01:03:14.025 --> 01:03:17.225
Fool! You blew our cover!
Men! Scatter!

01:03:18.265 --> 01:03:20.425
Not so fast!

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:23.935
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.

01:03:24.005 --> 01:03:25.365
Who are you guys?

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.135
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak. He's Camo.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:31.375
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?

01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:33.805
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:35.975
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:39.485
It's not like I told them our plan
is to use them to defeat Kazar's...

01:03:39.555 --> 01:03:42.385
Listen, just tell me,
did they take my son in there?

01:03:42.455 --> 01:03:44.255
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.

01:03:44.325 --> 01:03:47.555
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!

01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:50.065
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this? Men!

01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:52.895
Hey! No! Stop! Sammy!

01:03:52.965 --> 01:03:57.265
- Idiot! That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret. This one's confidential.

01:03:57.335 --> 01:03:59.275
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.

01:03:59.345 --> 01:04:03.145
Super-secret.
Top-secret. This is ultra-secret!

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:04.705
Enough! No more!

01:04:04.775 --> 01:04:08.405
Show 'em the super-top-secret
"no more?" Gotcha!

01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:09.505
No!

01:04:11.355 --> 01:04:12.685
I got an idea.

01:04:16.555 --> 01:04:19.585
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:22.065
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.

01:04:22.135 --> 01:04:24.565
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.

01:04:25.635 --> 01:04:27.155
Oh, my.

01:04:41.285 --> 01:04:43.655
You have got to be kidding me.

01:04:52.795 --> 01:04:55.525
Nigel, I don't know
what you're trying to pull,

01:04:55.605 --> 01:04:57.655
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!

01:04:58.605 --> 01:05:00.665
Why, you little...

01:05:00.735 --> 01:05:02.435
Silence, again!

01:05:02.505 --> 01:05:05.905
You do not speak to me!

01:05:05.975 --> 01:05:07.415
Nigel, what's the deal?

01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:10.415
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?

01:05:10.485 --> 01:05:14.015
Yes, we shall! What's on the menu?

01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:15.485
Them.

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.145
Oh, no.

01:05:18.225 --> 01:05:20.885
Eat friends and be god,
don't eat friends...

01:05:20.965 --> 01:05:23.295
God, friends, god, friends. God, I...

01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:24.955
Well, that was subtle.

01:05:25.035 --> 01:05:26.195
Prepare the meat fire!

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:31.425
Wait!

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:36.635
We cannot cook them without...

01:05:38.075 --> 01:05:39.175
...onion!

01:05:39.245 --> 01:05:42.705
Onions. Onions. Onions.

01:05:43.915 --> 01:05:45.815
Well, that was fast.

01:05:45.885 --> 01:05:48.015
Let the ritual begin.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:53.455
Move it!

01:05:53.525 --> 01:05:55.825
I am so mad at you!

01:05:56.965 --> 01:06:01.195
Wait! We also need... hats!

01:06:02.675 --> 01:06:06.305
Do we not have the party hats of death?

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:07.935
I've got mine!

01:06:08.015 --> 01:06:11.675
And before the feast, we must all...

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:13.675
What the...?

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:15.785
...levitate...

01:06:15.855 --> 01:06:17.715
...and spin uncontrollably!

01:06:17.785 --> 01:06:20.385
And feel a bit sick.

01:06:21.295 --> 01:06:22.625
How do I stop this thing?

01:06:22.695 --> 01:06:24.425
- Guys.
- Benny?

01:06:24.495 --> 01:06:26.525
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!

01:06:27.435 --> 01:06:29.365
We've got a plan. Follow me.

01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:32.025
- We?
- I can fly!

01:06:32.105 --> 01:06:35.565
Oh, Great Him,
we are humbled by your power.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:39.505
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!

01:06:41.985 --> 01:06:44.105
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!

01:06:44.185 --> 01:06:46.675
Major malfunction! Abandon ship!

01:06:55.265 --> 01:06:58.665
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.

01:06:58.735 --> 01:07:01.395
Great Him, it's another miracle!

01:07:01.465 --> 01:07:04.665
You've delivered us a real lion!

01:07:04.735 --> 01:07:06.865
Blag, your luck has turned.

01:07:06.945 --> 01:07:11.275
Thanks to the Great Him,
we shall all ascend tonight.

01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:14.335
Nigel, we've got
to create a distraction.

01:07:15.255 --> 01:07:16.545
Hang on a sec!

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:19.285
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!

01:07:19.355 --> 01:07:22.515
Ready? Stand back...

01:07:22.595 --> 01:07:26.185
...as the Great Me attacks the lion

01:07:26.265 --> 01:07:29.795
over 73 times my size!

01:07:33.535 --> 01:07:36.705
Dad? My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!

01:07:36.775 --> 01:07:38.575
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!

01:07:42.515 --> 01:07:43.985
Whack, whack, whack!

01:07:44.045 --> 01:07:45.445
- Dad!
- What? Ryan!

01:07:47.055 --> 01:07:49.815
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!

01:07:54.665 --> 01:07:57.895
At long last,
the cosmic balance has shifted.

01:07:57.965 --> 01:08:00.765
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!

01:08:00.835 --> 01:08:02.735
And predator has become prey!

01:08:02.805 --> 01:08:05.435
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!

01:08:05.505 --> 01:08:08.335
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies

01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:10.535
who's at the top of the food chain!

01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:14.815
Let's eat the brat first.

01:08:15.145 --> 01:08:18.145
Over my dead body!

01:08:31.965 --> 01:08:33.595
Yeah.

01:08:35.135 --> 01:08:36.725
Dad!

01:08:40.205 --> 01:08:42.835
He's gonna kill Samson
if we don't do something!

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:45.604
Why don't we use the secret play?

01:08:45.685 --> 01:08:49.444
I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.854
No! It's brilliant!

01:08:51.925 --> 01:08:54.685
They laughed at me
when I spoke of the Omen.

01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:58.385
But look who's laughing now!

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:06.805
Little to the left. Yeah.
No! Little to the right!

01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:09.635
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.274
Ding!

01:09:12.145 --> 01:09:13.335
Fire!

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.285
We gotta find something bigger!

01:09:23.354 --> 01:09:25.825
I know where we can
find something bigger.

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:31.854
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:33.555
You should have stayed at home.

01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:36.895
Now our shrine will become your tomb.

01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:38.335
Fire!

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:47.575
Ryan!

01:09:48.955 --> 01:09:49.935
Ryan!

01:09:51.915 --> 01:09:54.015
I don't typically eat dessert

01:09:54.085 --> 01:09:56.215
before the main course!

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:59.315
Get away from my son!

01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:09.935
Ryan.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.745
Ryan, are you still with me?

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:24.015
It's OK, Dad. I just want you to know

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:28.655
I'm sorry you didn't have a father
like the one I have.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.385
Ryan.

01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:34.895
How touching.

01:10:34.965 --> 01:10:37.795
But then, last words usually are.

01:10:39.975 --> 01:10:41.195
Finish them.

01:10:50.085 --> 01:10:51.635
What are you doing?

01:10:51.715 --> 01:10:55.515
I command you to attack them,
like true predators!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.925
We're tired of pretending
to be something we're not.

01:10:58.995 --> 01:11:03.125
But most of all, we're tired of you.

01:11:06.465 --> 01:11:09.065
Blag. Fine.

01:11:09.135 --> 01:11:11.035
I'll kill them myself!

01:11:16.575 --> 01:11:20.065
Dad, remember what you
always told me in your stories:

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.545
Dig deep.

01:11:40.205 --> 01:11:43.065
Oh, yeah, baby!

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:06.465
Let's go.

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:08.625
Yeah.

01:12:08.695 --> 01:12:11.265
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!

01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:15.035
And for the record,
I've always hated your choreography.

01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:17.945
It's so... '80s.

01:12:19.945 --> 01:12:21.345
That's right! Run!

01:12:21.415 --> 01:12:23.935
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!

01:12:24.015 --> 01:12:26.005
I will hunt you down!

01:12:28.425 --> 01:12:30.255
Everyone! To the boat!

01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:32.085
Top of the food chain, Ma!

01:12:32.155 --> 01:12:35.455
Top of the food chain...

01:12:35.525 --> 01:12:39.465
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!
I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

01:12:39.535 --> 01:12:41.895
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!
I'm so cuddly!</i>

01:12:50.515 --> 01:12:52.815
Hurry! We're never gonna make it!

01:12:52.885 --> 01:12:55.615
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters! Push!

01:12:56.715 --> 01:13:00.015
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!

01:13:11.505 --> 01:13:15.025
At least I saw the wild
before it disappeared.

01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:17.595
I can still see it. It's right...

01:13:17.675 --> 01:13:20.605
Here. I found my roar.

01:13:21.145 --> 01:13:23.665
We both did, son.

01:13:24.385 --> 01:13:28.755
You know, Dad, this'll be our first
story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.

01:13:28.815 --> 01:13:31.085
I don't think anybody's
gonna believe it.

01:13:34.025 --> 01:13:35.995
Incoming!

01:13:41.195 --> 01:13:43.325
<i>I'm so cuddly!</i>

01:13:43.405 --> 01:13:46.535
<i>Cuddly! I'm so cuddly!</i>

01:13:46.605 --> 01:13:49.595
I know you're cuddly. But can you float?

01:13:52.545 --> 01:13:54.605
<i>- I'm having a
- Really nice day</i>

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:56.545
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

01:13:56.615 --> 01:13:58.555
Step-kick left!

01:13:58.615 --> 01:14:00.315
<i>Really nice day</i>

01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:01.375
Step-kick right!

01:14:02.685 --> 01:14:05.085
- Splendid.
- No! Smashing. Hey!

01:14:05.155 --> 01:14:07.555
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?

01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:09.825
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.

01:14:09.895 --> 01:14:12.765
Hey, look, everyone! I'm a secret agent!

01:14:14.535 --> 01:14:17.565
Bridget, I get it. You're more
than a tall, lanky goddess.

01:14:17.635 --> 01:14:19.695
You're a strong, independent female.

01:14:19.775 --> 01:14:22.295
You don't need to be defined
by your relationship

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.675
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.

01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:29.215
What was that?

01:14:29.285 --> 01:14:33.185
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Bridget, baby.

01:14:33.255 --> 01:14:34.815
Oh, yeah yeah!

01:14:34.895 --> 01:14:36.555
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:37.615
Look out!

01:14:40.635 --> 01:14:42.995
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

01:14:43.065 --> 01:14:46.435
Yes! Did y'all see that? Check this!

01:14:46.505 --> 01:14:49.735
Go, Blag! Go, Blag! Go, Blag!

01:14:49.805 --> 01:14:51.635
Hey, Blag.

01:14:51.705 --> 01:14:55.205
- No parkin' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?

01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:56.545
Dad?

01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:59.105
Make some room there, big guy!

01:15:00.755 --> 01:15:03.245
<i>Really nice day
Really, really nice day</i>

01:15:03.325 --> 01:15:05.485
Yeah!

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:09.625
Pretty crazy, right? Pretty wild!

01:15:12.435 --> 01:15:14.695
Well, technically, it...

01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:17.135
It's awesome.

01:15:17.205 --> 01:15:19.505
Yes, right.

01:15:19.575 --> 01:15:22.475
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on! Everyone!

01:15:26.415 --> 01:15:28.475
This is gonna be a long ride home.

01:15:28.545 --> 01:15:30.105
<i>I'm havin' a</i>

01:15:30.185 --> 01:15:34.175
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day, really nice day</i>

01:15:34.255 --> 01:15:37.155
<i>- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you</i>

01:15:37.225 --> 01:15:38.695
<i>G'day</i>

01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:44.485
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?

01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:46.155
Just get out.

01:15:46.235 --> 01:15:48.165
Sorry about that, everybody. Sorry.

01:15:48.235 --> 01:15:49.665
Hello.

01:15:50.705 --> 01:15:52.365
Do carry on.

01:16:25.645 --> 01:16:27.235
Come on!

01:21:19.925 --> 01:21:22.865
All right,
everybody exit in an orderly...

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:24.955
All right, single file! Keep it...

01:21:26.765 --> 01:21:30.135
I seem to do a lot of falling
and screaming in this adventure.
