WEBVTT

00:34.890 --> 00:37.268
Nothing better than being home
for dinner.

00:37.434 --> 00:39.228
It's like I'm king of the castle.

00:39.395 --> 00:41.814
Dance, fools! Dance for your king!

00:41.981 --> 00:44.733
Hayley, your cold sore's
dripping in the potatoes.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.112
That's the last time I use lip liner
I find on the bus.

00:48.279 --> 00:53.033
- Oh, honey, no one believes that.
- I got it. Called it. Oh, yeah.

00:54.869 --> 00:56.704
Mom, it's Grandma and Grandpa.

00:56.871 --> 00:59.332
Damn it. Your parents
always show up unannounced.

00:59.498 --> 01:03.252
Steve, lower the table.
Hayley, hide the cutlery.

01:03.419 --> 01:05.004
Everyone, shoes off.

01:05.170 --> 01:08.841
- Francine, don't open that door.
- Stan, they're my parents.

01:09.592 --> 01:10.634
- Francine.
- Francine.

01:10.801 --> 01:14.346
Mah Mah. Bah Bah.

01:14.972 --> 01:17.892
- You bow.
- Shoes off in house.

01:20.186 --> 01:23.188
You just had to be adopted,
didn't you?

01:25.357 --> 01:28.027
- What is this?
- It's fish face with cabbage stem.

01:28.193 --> 01:29.945
In the West, we call that garbage.

01:30.112 --> 01:33.116
Oh, Mah Mah, this takes me back.

01:33.283 --> 01:36.160
<i>Eating trout lips,
watching T.J. Hooker.</i>

01:36.327 --> 01:38.662
- Hooker.
- Hooker.

01:41.707 --> 01:43.792
Devil sticks!

01:44.418 --> 01:46.671
- No fork.
- Listen, Bubba, this is my...

01:46.838 --> 01:48.922
- Bah Bah.
- That's what I said. Bah Bah.

01:49.089 --> 01:53.803
Bah Bah.
Twenty years, you still not get it right.

01:53.970 --> 01:57.389
Has it been a half-hour already?
Well, what a lovely visit.

01:57.556 --> 02:00.101
Please, let me help
throw your trunk onto the lawn.

02:00.268 --> 02:04.730
What Stan's trying to say is you're
welcome to stay as long as you want.

02:04.897 --> 02:07.984
We only stay for weekend.
We on our way cross-country.

02:08.151 --> 02:12.029
Mah Mah and I are fulfilling dream
to see world's largest everything.

02:12.196 --> 02:15.742
This week, thermometer.
Next week, ball of twine.

02:15.909 --> 02:20.204
Better hurry
before world's largest kitty bat it away.

02:22.666 --> 02:23.999
No.

02:29.339 --> 02:32.007
- Oh, no. No ducks.
- Ducks okay.

02:32.174 --> 02:35.762
Present for you, grandson.
Fireworks from family business.

02:35.929 --> 02:39.181
Steve, you can light one off now
and save the rest for later.

02:39.348 --> 02:41.559
I don't know. These look dangerous.

02:41.726 --> 02:45.687
The Donkey Slap, the Spurting Cobra,
the Mao Tse Boom...

02:45.854 --> 02:49.275
Hayley, your sore's leaking again.

02:49.442 --> 02:53.570
- I have remedy for whore lip.
- Thanks, Grandma.

02:55.156 --> 02:59.326
- It smells like doody.
- It is doody. From a monkey.

02:59.493 --> 03:02.831
- The Painful Squirt Bomb,
the Me Explode You Long Time...

03:02.997 --> 03:04.666
For God's sake, you're an American.

03:04.833 --> 03:08.211
Stop thinking about the consequences
and blow something up.

03:09.838 --> 03:12.881
Bad choice.
That one is named "English Patient."

03:13.048 --> 03:17.470
It looks beautiful, but it takes
a very long time for unsatisfying payoff.

03:17.637 --> 03:20.973
Bah Bah, you didn't wrap Jergens
in Ziploc.

03:21.140 --> 03:23.351
Lotion on everything.

03:23.518 --> 03:26.812
I lock spout.
Why you bring Jergens?

03:26.979 --> 03:30.608
Francine, did somebody bet me how
many washcloths I could fit in my butt...

03:30.775 --> 03:34.528
...or did I do this just for fun?
Doesn't matter. 17.

03:34.695 --> 03:36.739
Roger, company.

03:38.283 --> 03:43.204
It is filthy in here. If only I had a...
Wait, here's one. And another.

03:43.371 --> 03:46.124
Look at that.
I'm like a Clorox wipe dispenser.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.627
- I got dry skin.
- I wish I could get rid of them that easy.

03:49.794 --> 03:53.965
- You will show them some respect.
- Why? Not like they're your real parents.

03:54.131 --> 03:57.177
Stan, they are the only parents
I've ever known.

03:57.343 --> 03:59.679
They raised me
with the same love and kindness...

03:59.846 --> 04:02.307
...they showed their own
biological daughter.

04:02.473 --> 04:06.144
<i>Gwen. God, she's hot. Playboy hot.</i>

04:06.561 --> 04:09.522
Great. Bad enough I was aggravated.
Now I'm also turned on.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.441
You can be so insensitive, Francine.

04:11.608 --> 04:14.110
Kiss me like your sister...
You know what, forget it.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.363
We are so crazy.

04:18.531 --> 04:21.159
Gentlemen, have your mail
forwarded to the edge...

04:21.326 --> 04:24.162
...because that's where we're living.

04:26.247 --> 04:27.582
Lindsay Coolidge.

04:27.749 --> 04:30.752
The stuff lunchroom boners
are made of.

04:30.919 --> 04:32.795
You guys drinking beers
or something?

04:33.546 --> 04:37.759
Beers. Sparklers.
Check it out. I'm John Williams.

04:41.554 --> 04:44.015
- My face.
- Barry, I'm sorry. L...

04:44.182 --> 04:48.561
Burned your friend in the face.
That's extreme. Extreme is awesome.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.899
I never knew you were so crazy.

04:53.066 --> 04:56.277
- Totally crazy.
- There's nothing you won't do.

04:56.444 --> 05:00.073
- Nothing I won't do.
- That makes me hot.

05:00.239 --> 05:02.575
Tell you what.
I'll let you touch my breast...

05:02.742 --> 05:05.286
...if you can top burning Fatso here.

05:06.579 --> 05:09.165
That's what my nana calls me.

05:18.591 --> 05:22.428
- I'll give you $48 to assimilate.
- Shoes off in house.

05:23.847 --> 05:26.349
What are you...?
You don't have to wash paper towels.

05:26.516 --> 05:29.102
- I'll buy more.
- Wasteful. You waste.

05:29.268 --> 05:30.938
Every penny counts.

05:37.403 --> 05:41.447
What? You said my name. You tried to
bury it in your China talk, but I heard it.

05:41.614 --> 05:43.449
See if you like it.

05:43.616 --> 05:45.035
Francine.

05:45.202 --> 05:46.911
Look at your face. You hate it.

05:47.078 --> 05:49.455
Grandma, I don't know
if this is working.

05:49.622 --> 05:52.209
You must take the whole course
of monkey dung.

05:52.376 --> 05:55.378
You must leave it on and re-apply
after "een" hours.

05:55.545 --> 05:57.798
- Are you trying to say "nine"?
- Yes, een.

05:57.965 --> 06:01.259
The word is nine. Say nine.

06:01.426 --> 06:02.969
- Just follow me here. One.
- One.

06:03.136 --> 06:04.178
- Two.
- Two.

06:04.345 --> 06:05.597
- Three. Four.
- Three. Four.

06:05.764 --> 06:06.973
- Five. Six.
- Five. Six.

06:07.140 --> 06:08.474
- Seven. Eight.
- Seven. Eight.

06:08.641 --> 06:10.893
- Nine. No!
- Een.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.021
Damn duck grease.

06:14.188 --> 06:16.441
I just cleaned those paper towels.

06:16.607 --> 06:17.775
Never mind.

06:17.942 --> 06:22.071
I'll wash it along with tampon
I find in garbage. Wasteful.

06:22.238 --> 06:23.990
I can't take another minute of this.

06:24.157 --> 06:26.869
They're cheap, they're pushy,
they come in and take over.

06:27.035 --> 06:31.205
- I feel like a visitor in my own home.
- Stan, please. It's just one more day.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.667
Hey, look at me.

06:33.834 --> 06:37.837
Is that my new swimsuit?
I haven't even worn it yet.

06:39.214 --> 06:42.592
I like it here.
We're gonna stay two weeks.

06:42.758 --> 06:45.136
No! Come back here, Bubba!

06:45.304 --> 06:47.431
Gambled and lost.

06:48.182 --> 06:51.642
I want them out.
Not tomorrow, not in two weeks, now.

06:51.809 --> 06:53.687
I am not kicking my parents out.

06:53.854 --> 06:56.772
They're not your real parents.
They didn't give birth to you.

06:56.939 --> 07:00.903
Because they're not my birth parents
doesn't mean they're not my parents.

07:01.069 --> 07:04.488
And I never wanna hear
anything about it ever again.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.033
Damn it.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.411
They're out there somewhere.
And I'm not gonna rest until I find...

07:10.578 --> 07:13.415
...my birth in-laws.

07:18.419 --> 07:21.757
All right. Here's where we'll find out
who my real birth in-laws are.

07:21.924 --> 07:25.009
Did I ever tell you about my parents?
Tragic story.

07:25.176 --> 07:28.555
Very good. Now, while I hack
the database, you create a diversion.

07:29.014 --> 07:32.850
A diversion?
Oh, this is a caper, like in the movies.

07:33.018 --> 07:35.354
<i>Speaking of movies,
you ever see Man on Fire?</i>

07:35.520 --> 07:36.813
Is that the one with...

07:39.190 --> 07:41.610
Name: Francine Ling.

07:41.777 --> 07:44.655
Year of birth: Enter.

07:44.820 --> 07:49.660
Here they are. Nicholas and Cassandra
Dawson, Hilton Head, South Carolina.

07:49.826 --> 07:51.702
File: Print.

07:51.869 --> 07:54.498
"Failure to find printer. L5 error."

07:57.584 --> 07:59.210
Good job.

08:00.128 --> 08:03.840
All right. I turned off the printer.
I'm waiting for it to come back on.

08:04.007 --> 08:05.800
Okay, it's back on.

08:05.967 --> 08:09.304
Okay, I'm walking to the computer.
I'm by the computer.

08:09.471 --> 08:13.892
File: Print. And... No. L5 error again.

08:18.563 --> 08:20.941
I'll re-route it
to another printer in our system.

08:21.108 --> 08:23.652
Nope. L5. So it's not the printer.

08:23.819 --> 08:26.488
Strange. You could
just write the information down.

08:26.654 --> 08:29.866
Technology, huh?
Three steps forward, four steps back.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.619
- Keeps me in business.
- That it does. That it does.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.501
How'd you know I was fireproof?
I didn't even know.

08:40.668 --> 08:43.130
Wait. You did know I was, right?

08:43.296 --> 08:45.924
I'm gonna go with yes
and preserve the friendship.

08:46.091 --> 08:50.011
Look, guys, if I can pull this off,
Lindsay Coolidge will give me boob.

08:50.178 --> 08:52.389
Snot, remember that time
I gave you an orange?

08:52.556 --> 08:53.598
Yeah.

08:53.765 --> 08:56.393
Well, then let me put a firecracker
up your ass.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.354
No, I don't remember you
giving me half an orange.

08:59.521 --> 09:02.899
- So no, you can't.
- Why does everybody hate me so much?

09:03.066 --> 09:06.361
- Hey, guess what. I'm flame-retardant.
- Can I blow you up?

09:06.528 --> 09:08.822
- I don't see why not.
- Awesome!

09:12.701 --> 09:15.037
Oh, my God. They're rich.

09:17.789 --> 09:20.917
Mommy-in-law, Daddy-in-law,
I found you.

09:21.084 --> 09:23.295
Love me.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.469
Okay. I will now recklessly
blow up my cousin Roger.

09:32.929 --> 09:36.683
For good measure, I'm gonna
set the whole thing off with this:

09:36.850 --> 09:38.685
The Finger Blaster.

09:46.151 --> 09:48.153
My thumb!
I blew off my thumb!

09:48.320 --> 09:51.698
We're gonna get in trouble. Run!

09:53.450 --> 09:58.330
Okay, golden opportunity.
Say, "Charlie, they took my thumb."

09:58.497 --> 10:01.333
<i>Eric Roberts?
Pope of Greenwich Village?</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:03.461
No? You're a lot of fun.

10:06.171 --> 10:08.089
We're so glad you contacted us, Stan.

10:08.256 --> 10:10.843
We've often thought of the daughter
we had to give up.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.554
- That was a terrible, terrible day.
- I can only imagine.

10:14.721 --> 10:17.683
So Nick, Cassie, what do you guys
wanna do? See a movie?

10:17.850 --> 10:19.100
Can I look at your movies?

10:19.267 --> 10:21.269
<i>I bet you have Dave.
You wanna watch Dave?</i>

10:21.436 --> 10:25.774
Kevin Kline plays two characters.
Watch. Watching? Watch this.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.902
Thank you, Kalalo.

10:30.071 --> 10:33.949
You have Asians working for you
rather than being related to you.

10:34.115 --> 10:37.954
This is how it's supposed to be.
I'm finally home.

10:38.162 --> 10:40.205
<i>Mah Mah, Bah Bah</i>

10:40.372 --> 10:42.374
<i>In-laws show up uninvited</i>

10:42.540 --> 10:44.752
<i>Temper tantrums are incited</i>

10:44.919 --> 10:48.004
<i>Speak in English, speak in English</i>

10:48.171 --> 10:52.802
<i>Mah Mah, Bah Bah
So unrefined</i>

10:52.969 --> 10:57.390
<i>Stupid printer didn 't get me down
Drove out of town, look who I found</i>

10:57.556 --> 11:01.643
<i>Nick and Cass
They're the in-laws of my dreams</i>

11:01.810 --> 11:03.938
<i>Caucasian folks of well-off means</i>

11:04.105 --> 11:07.440
<i>Love the place I'm in
No more Mandarin</i>

11:07.649 --> 11:09.818
<i>- Steaks and cash
- Pull</i>

11:09.985 --> 11:14.156
<i>Shooting rolls of paper towels
As they enunciate their vowels</i>

11:14.323 --> 11:16.866
<i>God, I'm happy
Hey, found a home today</i>

11:17.952 --> 11:19.996
<i>Ducks and chopsticks</i>

11:20.162 --> 11:22.080
<i>Boundaries, they don 't give a hoot</i>

11:22.247 --> 11:24.333
<i>Farting in my bathing suit</i>

11:24.500 --> 11:27.670
<i>Who needs that, Stan?
Who needs that, Stan?</i>

11:28.170 --> 11:29.671
<i>Nick and Cass</i>

11:29.838 --> 11:32.133
<i>Now I'm skiing on a yacht</i>

11:32.299 --> 11:36.886
<i>Suddenly I'm drinking sparkling wine
Living like a swell is mighty fine</i>

11:37.053 --> 11:42.268
<i>If you find your mate's adopted
New in-laws can be co-opted</i>

11:43.768 --> 11:45.521
<i>Screw the past</i>

11:45.688 --> 11:47.898
<i>This is my new family now</i>

11:48.065 --> 11:52.528
<i>And my life is back to God's design</i>

11:52.695 --> 11:55.489
<i>These are not your in-laws</i>

11:55.656 --> 12:01.996
<i>Because they're mine</i>

12:03.747 --> 12:06.792
Well, this has been
a great afternoon, Stan.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.919
But we should probably
meet Francine.

12:09.086 --> 12:10.962
- Who's that, now?
- Our daughter.

12:11.129 --> 12:15.342
Is that necessary? I mean, the triangle
is the strongest structure in nature.

12:15.509 --> 12:17.385
Stan, we enjoy your company...

12:17.552 --> 12:21.182
...but we can't possibly continue
this relationship without Francine.

12:21.348 --> 12:23.851
- She does know you're here?
- Of course.

12:24.018 --> 12:26.562
She cannot wait to meet you guys.
Cannot wait.

12:29.356 --> 12:30.816
Hey, Francine. Stan.

12:30.983 --> 12:34.487
Can't talk, on a mission, under fire.
Let me throw a quick hypothetical.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.822
What if I told you
I met the nicest couple...

12:36.989 --> 12:39.450
...who have a ton of money,
old-fashioned values...

12:39.617 --> 12:41.619
...and think my water-skiing
is top-notch?

12:41.785 --> 12:45.164
Then what if I told you
that couple were your birth parents?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.541
I'd be incredibly angry,
hurt and betrayed.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.002
And in addition
to never wanting to meet them...

12:50.169 --> 12:52.796
...I'd never wanna
see you again either.

12:52.963 --> 12:56.091
Fun game, these hypotheticals.
Keeps me alive in the trenches.

12:56.258 --> 12:58.677
Bring you back a snow globe.

12:59.053 --> 13:01.347
Kalalo, dramatic sting.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.308
That was terrible.

13:09.271 --> 13:11.649
- I'm back from my mission.
- Where's my snow globe?

13:11.815 --> 13:15.277
I know. Listen, I was just thinking
about genetic disease.

13:15.444 --> 13:18.072
For the kids' sake,
we should meet your real parents...

13:18.239 --> 13:21.659
...and get their medical history.
What if baldness runs in your family?

13:21.825 --> 13:25.246
Can you imagine anything more horrific
than Steve losing his hair?

13:25.412 --> 13:29.208
My thumb. Where's my thumb?

13:29.375 --> 13:34.047
Found it. No, it's a baby pine cone.
Add that one to the collection.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.217
Oh, my God. Here it is.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.929
My thumb. Get out of here, crow.

13:41.804 --> 13:43.180
My face!

13:43.347 --> 13:45.975
Why, crow, why?

13:46.141 --> 13:49.436
Mah Mah and Bah Bah
treat me like their own flesh and blood.

13:49.603 --> 13:53.775
Stan, I have no interest
in tracking down my birth parents, ever.

13:53.942 --> 13:57.152
<i>So if you were in The Matrix,
you'd have taken the blue pill...</i>

13:57.319 --> 13:59.488
...and never seen the world
for what it was...

13:59.655 --> 14:02.241
...and the movie would've
only been 20 minutes.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.118
I want you to think about that.

14:04.285 --> 14:08.331
You're not gonna think about that.
You don't understand what I'm saying.

14:08.498 --> 14:11.792
The Lings must have a skeleton
in their closet.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.004
Or in a trunk.

14:17.673 --> 14:19.717
Why would they need these?

14:19.883 --> 14:23.178
There must be something in here
that's incriminating.

14:27.224 --> 14:28.852
Do they?

14:29.019 --> 14:31.603
- Do they what? Who's they?
- Oh, right. Sorry.

14:31.770 --> 14:35.483
Remember how earlier you said Mah Mah
and Bah Bah treat you like their own?

14:35.650 --> 14:38.569
- Yeah.
- Do they?

14:38.736 --> 14:42.240
Stan, this is my parents' will.
I can't read this.

14:42.407 --> 14:46.035
Even where they leave everything
to hot Gwen and you get nothing?

14:46.201 --> 14:48.663
I don't believe it.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.707
No matter what the Lings told you...

14:50.874 --> 14:53.208
...you're always gonna be
the adopted daughter...

14:53.375 --> 14:58.464
...that they'll never love like their own.
I'm sorry, Francine. I'm sorry.

14:58.630 --> 15:02.594
God, is Gwen hot. I mean, oh, my God.

15:03.928 --> 15:07.598
<i>Look what I tape off TV.
Four episodes of T.J. Hooker.</i>

15:07.765 --> 15:09.476
Hooker.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.936
- How come you no Hooker with me?
- You cut me out of your will?

15:13.103 --> 15:16.566
- You go through our trunk?
- You gave everything to Gwen.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.109
It's because she's your real daughter,
isn't it?

15:19.276 --> 15:21.570
You dishonor us and yourself.

15:21.737 --> 15:26.241
Get out of my house, both of you.
And get out of my life.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.789
- Bye-bye, Bubba.
- It's Bah...

15:30.955 --> 15:34.249
You were right, Stan.
I wanna meet my real parents.

15:34.416 --> 15:38.630
Don't worry, honey. I'll find them
no matter how long it takes.

15:38.797 --> 15:40.047
They'll be here at six.

15:46.387 --> 15:49.265
Duck, duck, duck, goose.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.687
God, that's deeply programmed.
They're here!

16:00.859 --> 16:03.321
Please come in.
Francine's getting her hair done.

16:04.739 --> 16:07.158
So this is her.

16:07.325 --> 16:10.161
I remember the day
we had to give her away.

16:10.745 --> 16:14.165
I'm sorry, but children aren't allowed
in the first-class cabin.

16:14.332 --> 16:16.626
I can't fly coach.
That would be awful.

16:16.793 --> 16:19.212
Can you just give this away for us?
You're a doll.

16:19.379 --> 16:23.007
Oh, thank God. For a moment I thought
we were going to have a problem.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.554
So you completely
abandoned Francine?

16:27.720 --> 16:32.058
Yes. Yes, we did.
And we had a great vacation.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.310
And the money we saved
not having a child...

16:34.477 --> 16:36.520
...was put toward some
smart investments.

16:37.522 --> 16:39.524
I think I need a drink.

16:39.983 --> 16:42.360
Stan, these people are monsters.

16:42.527 --> 16:45.238
You know what my country's done.
Even I find it repulsive.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.616
Well, they're rich and speak English
good. How bad can they be?

16:48.783 --> 16:51.077
- But Stan...
- Not listening.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.872
Stan, the English Patient
is getting close to detonating.

17:05.590 --> 17:06.800
Stan! Stan!

17:08.011 --> 17:10.012
How'd we get here?

17:12.682 --> 17:15.935
- Please help.
- One sec.

17:16.102 --> 17:20.315
Hi, Sid. Quick question. I'm in a burning
house. A man is caught under a beam.

17:20.481 --> 17:23.443
What's my liability if I help him?

17:23.608 --> 17:25.361
I thought so.

17:25.528 --> 17:28.990
Stan, we're gonna wait in the yard,
see how this plays out.

17:29.157 --> 17:32.285
Wait! You can't leave me here.
I'm your son-in-law.

17:48.760 --> 17:53.306
Don't worry, buddy.
You're someone else's problem now.

17:57.018 --> 18:01.105
Mommy-in-law. Daddy-in-law.
Save me.

18:03.357 --> 18:05.944
I knew you'd come back for me.

18:22.919 --> 18:24.545
Come on, let's go.

18:26.632 --> 18:28.216
Lucky I come back for trunk.

18:28.382 --> 18:31.594
I can't believe you risked your life
to save mine.

18:31.761 --> 18:35.098
Of course I save you, Stan.
You're my son-in-law.

18:36.098 --> 18:40.354
You make my Francine happy.
Her happiness is all I ever want.

18:40.521 --> 18:43.898
Then why did you cut her out of the will
and leave everything to Gwen?

18:44.065 --> 18:47.069
Because Gwen is moron.
She needs lots of help.

18:47.236 --> 18:49.403
She fail math in school.

18:49.570 --> 18:51.656
Imagine Chinese girl can't do math.

18:51.823 --> 18:54.743
It's embarrassing when children
don't adhere to stereotypes.

18:54.910 --> 18:59.121
Francine is our smart daughter.
We never have to worry about her.

18:59.288 --> 19:02.543
Plus, she marry okay.

19:04.418 --> 19:07.339
I saw fire. I call "een" one one.

19:10.508 --> 19:12.510
We got your thumb sewed on
just in time...

19:12.677 --> 19:15.848
...but your hand will be numb
until the anesthesia wears off.

19:16.014 --> 19:17.974
Thanks, Doc.

19:18.975 --> 19:21.478
Hey, Steve. Not only did you
blow your thumb off...

19:21.645 --> 19:23.105
...you burned your house down.

19:23.272 --> 19:26.692
- I burned my house down.
- That's so extreme.

19:26.858 --> 19:31.779
You get the grand prize.
I want you to touch my whole breast.

19:31.946 --> 19:36.159
- This is it. This is the moment.
- So, what do you think?

19:36.326 --> 19:39.328
I can't feel anything.

19:39.495 --> 19:42.958
- Are you saying I have small breasts?
- No! No! That's not what l...

19:43.125 --> 19:44.959
You're a real jerk, Steve Smith.

19:45.126 --> 19:51.133
Come back. Let me try the other hand.
Rip out the IV. Rip it out. Rip it out!

19:51.300 --> 19:53.050
I don't deserve this.

19:53.217 --> 19:55.012
Why the injustice?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.811
Why, crow? Why?

20:04.396 --> 20:06.522
Oh, my God. Our house.

20:06.689 --> 20:07.816
Nothing to worry about.

20:07.983 --> 20:10.193
Just your average
greasy-Chinese-duck fire.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.279
Is everyone okay?
Steve, Hayley, Roger?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.699
Everyone's fine.

20:16.450 --> 20:20.786
And Klaus. Is Klaus okay?
He's the only one I really care about.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.166
Too late, Francine. Too fucking late.

20:26.209 --> 20:29.004
I'm so excited to meet them.
Where are they, Stan?

20:29.171 --> 20:30.422
Where are my real parents?

20:34.091 --> 20:38.096
Your real parents are right over there.

20:38.263 --> 20:42.059
- What are you talking about?
- The Lings are your real parents.

20:42.225 --> 20:44.394
I was wrong, Francine.
They're good people.

20:44.561 --> 20:46.438
They'd do anything
for your happiness.

20:46.605 --> 20:48.482
- But the will...
- Trust me.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.817
They know what they're doing.

20:52.486 --> 20:54.779
My own pony?

20:57.949 --> 21:02.537
Mah Mah and Bah Bah
love you, Francine.

21:09.795 --> 21:11.671
Everything okay, Stan?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.257
I would've named her Buttercup.

21:50.044 --> 21:52.129
