This programme contains
some violent scenes, strong language

00:06.520 --> 00:10.600
and scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.360
ANA: He is looking at me
as if he knows me.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.160
Perhaps he does.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.000
Perhaps he does, too.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.760
Sometimes I think every man
in the city understands

00:33.760 --> 00:35.440
I was doing money.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.760
Do they understand I was
someone who could not say no?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.160
Ana?

00:51.280 --> 00:52.640
Thanks for calling us.

They have a girl.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.560
A slave.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.560
So young, so small.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.760
A star, branded here on her wrist.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.000
They call her Skinny,
but her name is Daniela.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.800
Is she in Sweden?

01:27.800 --> 01:30.520
Erm, we can't give
you that information, I'm sorry.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.440
So, you tell me nothing
and want me to tell you everything?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.400
 I don't think you're right for him

01:45.400 --> 01:48.240
 Think of what it might
have been if you'd

01:48.240 --> 01:50.880
 Took a bus to Chinatown

she's dead, too.

ANA: You are thinking,
why doesn't she scream,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.080
like they do in the movies?

03:27.080 --> 03:30.240
Because it's not like

Ana from Sibiu,
I know all about her already.

At home in Romania, we hear
about the girls who are groomed.

The girls who are
tricked into falling

05:15.600 --> 05:17.680

05:17.680 --> 05:19.560
"Silly girls," we all think.

But I'm not a silly girl...

05:23.560 --> 05:26.280
..and nobody has groomed me,
or tricked me.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
The men are Romanian, like me.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.480
They have stolen me off
the streets of London,

05:35.480 --> 05:39.840
and all I can think is -
nobody knows where I am.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.760
Not even me.

Extra for anal,
cum in mouth, without condom.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.720
I was born in...
Sibiu, Romania, yes.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.320
It says so on this

14:13.440 --> 14:15.160
No, that can't be right.

mobile phones,

14:57.400 --> 14:59.120
Why don't they arrest the men?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.880
What are we guilty of,
exactly, compared to them?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.480
Their wives are cold.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.800
They don't get enough sex at home.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.880
Idiot.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.840
It isn't sex though, is it?

15:17.320 --> 15:18.600
It's rape.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.920
We go along with it.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.160
It's our job.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.520
You think you're special, Ana?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.400

15:29.400 --> 15:30.920
She's a hole.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.520
I'm a hole.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.000
That's how men are.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.480
Not my man. He loves me. Mm.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.760
Can I call my mother, please?

15:52.760 --> 15:55.320
Could you just shut up
about your mother?

15:55.320 --> 15:57.480
We all have mothers.

And some of us have children, too.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.880
300 euros. It's nothing.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.360
It's not the money, Lily.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.040
If she starts on
about running away again...

16:23.040 --> 16:24.600
I've got a criminal record -

16:24.600 --> 16:26.520
and who will believe me?

16:26.520 --> 16:27.760
Nobody.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.200
So, that's 1,000 for the week.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.839
Extendable, just pop by the office.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.319
Family holiday, is it?

17:20.319 --> 17:22.599
Oh, yeah, we love it here.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.440
It's so friendly.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.440
OK, enjoy. Thank you.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.320
So, that's £1,000 the three
of you owe me, for starters.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.200
Blind One, close curtains.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.920
Hello.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.920
I want to restart my profiles
on a new country code, yes.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.480

18:12.600 --> 18:13.920
Look at this girl.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.120
Spanish, apparently.
Isabella.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.880
The one with the star on her wrist?

18:20.880 --> 18:22.800
She's never over 18, is she?

18:24.640 --> 18:25.880
Boss.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.840
Would they ever be daft enough
to bring an underage girl over here?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.480
Underage makes the most money.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.840
The star again.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.880
Italian, now, apparently.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.360
That's the same wee girl.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.080
Find out where they are.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.680
Let's pay her a visit.

PHONE RINGS

18:49.280 --> 18:51.040
Hello, baby.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.440
It's Declan.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.200
I've booked the porn-star
experience with Natalia.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.160
She's waiting for you.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.760
I'm on the square.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.880
Now, you see the glass door?

19:01.880 --> 19:05.080
Straight ahead? Mm-hm.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.800
OK. Press number 93.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.480
DOOR BUZZES
I'm in.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.240
She's longing to see you.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.480
Declan, he's a pervert.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.000
Look, he's an arsehole, I agree...

19:37.600 --> 19:39.840
..but I've had worse.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.640
He wanted it to hurt.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.680
They all want it to hurt.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.400
PHONE RINGS

19:58.080 --> 20:02.160
Before I went on maternity leave,
there was a woman on every corner.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.400
Local women can't compete, now.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.200
There.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.720
Security guiding him in.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.120
Textbook.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.960
Hi, that's our mark
approaching the door now.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.000
Yep. Copy that. We see him.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.040
You don't look much
like your photograph.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.040
You do do what it says
on your profile?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.800
On the website.

20:51.880 --> 20:55.040
Where it says the things
that you like to do.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.960
I have never seen my profile.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.080
And there is nothing I like doing.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.680
BANGING ON DOOR
Police! Stop where you are!

21:07.800 --> 21:10.480
Detective Inspector Grant,
Police Service of Northern Ireland.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.200
I have a warrant
to search these premises.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.240
No, listen, listen,

21:13.240 --> 21:15.560
my wife doesn't need to know about
this, surely to God.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.080
Look, I have kids.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.320
We were just talking.
Put on your shirt.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.720
We were just talking.
Nothing really happened. I mean...

21:23.720 --> 21:26.160
I'm putting on my shirt, but look,
will you just listen to me

21:26.160 --> 21:28.880
for, like, two minutes. I wasn't...
I wasn't doing anything.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.240
I have kids.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.120
Check the room for luggage labels...

21:38.160 --> 21:40.000
Do you want to take a seat?

21:41.560 --> 21:43.680
We just want to ask
you some questions.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.520
You're not in any trouble.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.880
You're not going to be arrested.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.400
We're not going to involve
the immigration authorities.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.280
We're not here to take your money.
We're here to help you.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.280
You said you arrived
on March the 3rd?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.280
Who paid for your ticket?

22:12.280 --> 22:13.520
Ancuta.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.080
We are cousins. All family.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.880
And you take care of
everyone's passports?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.520
Yeah, yeah. For safety.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.320
So many bad people.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.720
Do you girls recognise
any of these men?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.520
Oh, no men. Only girls.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.960
If any of you were brought
here against your will,

22:34.960 --> 22:37.800
if any of you are being forced
to work, to do sex work

22:37.800 --> 22:40.920
that you don't want to do,
we can help you.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.160
I'm happy. I'm free.

22:51.400 --> 22:55.480
You Irish women,
you're too old, too fat,

22:55.480 --> 22:57.080
too much complaining.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.080
He agrees with me.
Don't you, baby?

23:09.320 --> 23:11.640
Bag it all up.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.520
We'll bring this one home
to his wife.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.440
The British police are a joke.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.480
Passports, now.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.200
Blind One.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.080
They don't talk to us
because they're afraid.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.480
Boss, nobody seems remotely
afraid of anybody but us.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.440
Here. Did you get it? Yeah.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.000
Her name is Daniela Corbu.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.440
She turned 18 on Monday the 2nd.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.600
By Tuesday lunchtime,
she was on a plane to Galway -

23:57.600 --> 24:00.440
and no, she doesn't
want to talk to us.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.800
Rachel, come here.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.000
Sex slaves?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.520
Come on, boss, it's not as if
we find these women

24:14.520 --> 24:15.960
chained to the radiators.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.840
Do you want out? No, I just...

24:20.360 --> 24:22.600
I don't know. I go home,
I put my baby in the bath,

24:22.600 --> 24:25.360
I smell them places
on myself, you know?

24:25.360 --> 24:27.240
It all just takes so bloody long.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
You like results.
You like arrests, and trials,

24:29.240 --> 24:32.720
and long prison sentences.
Yeah, I'm a police officer.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.680
You get caught with
a kilo of cocaine in your car,

24:35.680 --> 24:38.360
no question, you're going
down for five to ten years minimum.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.720
Sounds like my kind of job.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.200
You get caught with
a trafficked human being,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.280
chances are nobody will even notice.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.160
She'll be too scared to complain.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.240
I'm not having that.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.440
Not in my town.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.200
Your town, is it?

24:54.960 --> 24:58.520
Dougie, have you ever even
had a single woman say thank you?

24:58.520 --> 25:00.000
One.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Scottish gang, that time.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.600
She grabbed my leg.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.360
"Thank God you're here," she said.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.080
One. One is all it takes.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.760
One woman brave enough to talk.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.280
Any luck?

25:13.280 --> 25:14.640
No. The lines are dead now.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.920
Our birds have flown.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.600
They'll be back...

25:19.600 --> 25:21.560
..and we'll be waiting for them.
Come on.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.600
Let me go, Luca.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.080
Let me go and I won't tell
a soul what you did.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.600
Funny girl.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.040
The people I clean for in London...

26:09.040 --> 26:11.080
..they'll tell someone I'm missing.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.440
They will say, "Bloody
Eastern Europeans, so ungrateful,

26:14.440 --> 26:15.880
"so unreliable,

26:15.880 --> 26:18.240
"last time I let any of them
clean up my shit."

26:21.200 --> 26:23.360
Do money, Blind One.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.720
It's OK.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.640
It won't be forever.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.480
Only don't waste your time
thinking anyone is looking for you.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.120
Get in the car, bitch.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.960
My last client complained

27:25.960 --> 27:28.160
because I don't look
like my photograph.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.960
Ask Ancuta for new ones.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.280
I get loads of compliments on mine.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.120
But I've never had any...

27:39.200 --> 27:41.280
..and I'm thinking maybe
that's because

27:41.280 --> 27:43.360
they don't want
anyone to recognise me.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.160
Anyone to come looking for me.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.160
Look, we've got competition.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.880
Mm. The one in the middle is pretty.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.720
But none of them are smiling.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.440
You do more money when you smile.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.720
No need to pay rent.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.840
They can paint the place,
get it ready for my students.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.920
Brilliant white.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.560
The woodwork, too.
Always looks fresh.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.520
So, who's first?

28:26.240 --> 28:27.560
Well, now.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.360
HE INHALES

28:36.240 --> 28:37.680
Sweet 16.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.160
Did you not hear me say
you'll be painting this place

28:45.160 --> 28:46.880
in your bare little arses?

28:46.880 --> 28:48.640
Clothes.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.960
BANGING ON DOOR

28:58.840 --> 29:00.120
Go.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.040
In there.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.280
In there.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.080
You'll have your fun later.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.160
For what you want, it's 500 euros.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.080
Don't touch her face.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.520
In there.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.560
No, no, no!

29:51.560 --> 29:53.080
BANGING

29:57.520 --> 30:01.720
ANA SHOUTS AND STRUGGLES, MEN GRUNT

30:42.680 --> 30:44.120
Let me see your face.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.720
You'll mend.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.680
ANA SOBS AND SHIVERS

32:07.080 --> 32:08.440
Listen to me.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.520
Just don't cross her.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.400
Do money for her, do lots of money,
and everything will be OK.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.800
You are leaving?

32:20.080 --> 32:21.680
I can't look after you any more.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.520
You call this looking after me?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.960
Luca, I'm dying here.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.480
Don't leave me with her.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.000
Get out, Blind One.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.400
Don't think so much about escaping.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.240
Think about surviving.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.640
Do lots of money and...

32:49.520 --> 32:51.000
..then go home.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
How much did you get for me?

32:56.320 --> 32:57.720
How much?!

33:00.000 --> 33:01.640
30,000 euros.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.600
I paid him big money for you.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.440
Time to start paying it back.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.280
We can't just rescue them.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.520
We can't remove an adult woman
without her permission,

33:37.520 --> 33:40.800
and she won't give it
because she has these pimps,

33:40.800 --> 33:43.640
violent men who are threatening
her family back home.

33:43.640 --> 33:47.640
Plus, there's often
a very deep level of control,

33:47.640 --> 33:49.320
psychological control.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.400
At least you do know
where these brothels are?

33:51.400 --> 33:54.080
For a couple of days
at a time, yes, we do.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.520
They pop up in Northern Ireland,
then they disappear

33:56.520 --> 33:58.360
and then they pop up
in the Republic.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.720
Pop-up brothels?

33:59.720 --> 34:01.520
Yes - but can I just say,

34:01.520 --> 34:04.920
we abolished slavery
in Britain in 1834.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.520
Can't say I'd noticed.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.960
And back to you, Robin.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.120
From the side.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.760
Hello, baby.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.639
Natalia, will she do rough play?

34:21.639 --> 34:24.480
Lower. I'm really looking
for someone younger.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.000
There'll be three of us.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.560
I didn't think
she liked me last time.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.960
Yes, baby, of course she likes you.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.440
Isabella, for the
porn star experience.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.840
Arse out.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.800
She has to like it, you know?

34:41.520 --> 34:43.920
Kataryna, the girlfriend experience.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.719
She's longing to see you.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.360
She was a Kataryna, too.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.840
You must know her.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.360
Dark hair, about your height.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.840
Ukrainian, like you.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.080
I'm not Ukrainian.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.360
We got very close.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.360
Went to dinner, the cinema.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.400
She likes rom coms.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.640
We were getting engaged.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.040
She was bringing
her whole family over.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.760
And you paid for it all.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.960
I loved her.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.280
Look again.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.320
You must know her.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.760
I don't know people.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.120
You don't like being kind, do you?

35:51.760 --> 35:53.360
The girlfriend experience...

35:54.800 --> 35:56.200
..it's wasted money on you.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.440
She's not your girlfriend...

36:03.200 --> 36:04.440
..and neither am I.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.160
THEY LAUGH

36:17.200 --> 36:21.880
"Timeless romantic allure."

36:21.880 --> 36:24.400
I fucking love Italy.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.040
Me too. Fucking love it.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.880
"Silent, no feelings.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.760
"I can't fuck a girl like that.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.560
"I want my girls to be lively.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.280
"No stars."

36:37.440 --> 36:39.760
"No enthusiasm.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.680
"Lay there like a block of wood.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.800
"One star."

36:47.320 --> 36:50.200
"Pretty enough, but she looks
like a drug addict,

36:50.200 --> 36:51.880
"and her breath smells."

36:53.080 --> 36:55.200
My teeth are broken in pieces.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.480
"One star."

37:04.480 --> 37:06.400
Of course my breath smells.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.160
People read these reviews, you know.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.320
They are not people,
they are arseholes.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.800
And I'm glad my breath smells.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.160
30,000 euros?

37:36.160 --> 37:37.480
For that?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.720
30,000 euros.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.280
I made it back in 13 days.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.560
300 arseholes, in 13 days.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.040
I can hardly walk,
and you want me to enjoy it?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.120
DOOR OPENS

39:17.600 --> 39:19.640
I like a quiet life, Blind One.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.560
Happy customers, happy money,

39:24.560 --> 39:27.360
to send back home
to our happy families.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.320
These things make me happy.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.240
But you...

39:35.240 --> 39:38.440
..always fighting.
Always, "No, no, no."

39:38.440 --> 39:39.640
"No, no, no."

39:41.480 --> 39:43.200
Which is good, actually.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.520
Don't tell me this is news
for the Blind One.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.280
Don't tell me she doesn't know
why they love her so.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.360
Why she does so much money.

40:01.880 --> 40:04.200
Everybody wants the one
who likes to be raped.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.480
Stupid blind fucking bitch!

40:22.640 --> 40:25.240
Do you want to work for me, or not?!

40:30.360 --> 40:32.440
Come on, Blind One.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.120
Let me explain.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.520
I look after you.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.040
I protect you.

40:45.320 --> 40:50.760
From the police,
immigration, the others.

40:54.640 --> 40:58.360
Or I leave you here alone,
in the middle of nowhere.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.280
I will ask you just once more.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.320
Do you want to work for me?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.960
Do you want to do money for me?

41:16.520 --> 41:19.120
Or would you prefer to die
like a dog

41:19.120 --> 41:21.040
in the middle of the road?

41:22.440 --> 41:26.320
So that your poor mama will never
know what happened to her baby.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.000
HORN HONKS

42:05.600 --> 42:07.040
Never mind.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.160
You've got us.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.000
Funny, Blind One.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.440
Look at yourself,
sat here with us...

43:19.160 --> 43:20.760
..among all the straight people.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.960
All the straight people,
all looking straight through us.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.480
I cannot see them.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.920
Of course you can.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.560
My glasses.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.760
Now are you going to say
I never give you anything?

43:56.600 --> 43:58.280
She loves me now, look.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.280
Look at all the stupid women.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.320
No idea what their husbands
get up to behind their backs.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.120
They are blind.

44:13.880 --> 44:15.560
No.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.840
You and me, baby...

44:18.080 --> 44:19.640
..we are invisible.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.840
They're clearly all free agents.

44:39.920 --> 44:43.400
This company insists that all
girls provide verification shots.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.000
All that proves is she knows
how to hold up a piece of cardboard.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.280
On the contrary. It's clear
evidence she knows what she's doing.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.800
We suspect some of the women
advertised on your website

44:51.800 --> 44:53.600
have been trafficked.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.840
No, no.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.560
All our employers
operate legitimately.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.760
All the girls that use
our service are free,

45:01.760 --> 45:04.160
willing, and volunteers.

45:04.160 --> 45:07.520
Anything else is bad for business.

45:13.120 --> 45:16.160
Ionut Ilie and Ancuta Schwarz.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.920
Members of an organised crime group
from Romania.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.440
No-one here has any contact
with individual advertisers.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.960
I mean to get a court order,

45:32.960 --> 45:36.120
requiring you to release
all financial transactions

45:36.120 --> 45:37.880
between these individuals.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.160
My pleasure.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.920
Free movement of labour, eh?

45:47.280 --> 45:49.240
Anything else is bad for business.

45:55.720 --> 45:59.840
You girls will be busy this week,
with the Downpatrick Races on.

46:02.840 --> 46:07.120
Oh, er, my horse came in at 16-1.

46:07.120 --> 46:11.480
I bought you something
with my winnings, Natalia.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.040
Huh?

46:20.720 --> 46:23.000
Oh, well, never mind.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.320
Give us a wee kiss, huh?

46:33.560 --> 46:34.600
See you soon.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.840
Yes.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.760
Soon, Declan.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.160
What?

47:24.160 --> 47:25.760
I can do some of that.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.360
Take the burden off Ancuta.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.200
PHONE RINGS

47:37.800 --> 47:39.200
Try it.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.200
Always answer the same.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.640
"Baby, baby, baby."

47:48.720 --> 47:50.120
Hello, baby.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.920
Hey, can we book an hour with Lucy?

47:51.920 --> 47:53.280
Lucy.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.240
She's so pretty.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.000
There'll be three of us.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.440
No problem, baby.

48:01.480 --> 48:02.680
Good.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.520
Will text you the address, baby.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.040
Yes. Bye-bye.

48:14.360 --> 48:17.160
She needs more names
and more profiles.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.320
They all need more profiles.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.320
Nobody is doing enough money.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.640
Get it done while I'm in Sweden.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.400
Don't ever let me catch you
looking at my man.

48:47.800 --> 48:50.040

48:57.080 --> 48:58.600
Go on.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.120
Hello, baby.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.920
I want to book Melanie...

49:11.920 --> 49:14.080
..and Sabrina...

49:14.080 --> 49:15.960
OK, baby.

49:15.960 --> 49:18.520
..and Rica, and Liv and Yasmin.
Yeah, all at once.

49:20.520 --> 49:24.800
That's maybe not possible
as they are all busy girls.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.320
You then, you come?

49:26.320 --> 49:27.640
It's 200 for her.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.280
Aye, no bother.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.080
Your first outcall.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.280
Where are you, baby?

49:43.800 --> 49:46.080
Nice. I smell money.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.520
Hello, baby.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.600
Here is Conchita.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.800
Well, this is grand. Come in.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.680
Oh!

50:19.680 --> 50:22.680
Look, look, every one
a perfect gentleman. So...

50:24.640 --> 50:26.040
Then the price is more.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.440
Is this enough?

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
You have fun with these boys.

50:55.120 --> 50:58.120
Just checking you're
not wearing a wire.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.960
Paranoid, I know.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.400
Take a seat.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.960
Fancy a beer?

51:09.960 --> 51:11.720
So, Conchita.

51:11.720 --> 51:15.040
You answer the phones,
but it's not your business, right?

51:15.040 --> 51:17.000
You work for pimps?

51:17.000 --> 51:20.160
And you're not...
you're not Spanish, not really?

51:20.160 --> 51:22.560
I'm guessing Romanian?

51:22.560 --> 51:24.280
You're a policeman?

51:26.240 --> 51:28.520
You ever seen police
with one of these wee things

51:28.520 --> 51:29.920
round his leg? Huh?

51:29.920 --> 51:32.920
If he goes out past midnight,
he goes up in smoke!

51:35.560 --> 51:38.760
It's part of his bail conditions.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.360
You are criminals?

51:40.360 --> 51:42.200
Not criminals either.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.600
Your man there's just daft enough
to keep getting caught. Tae fuck.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.160
I don't do drugs.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.200
Do you do taking your clothes off?

52:12.240 --> 52:13.960
What the fuck happened to you?

52:19.400 --> 52:21.000
Put your clothes back on.

52:32.760 --> 52:36.280
Look, we could help you.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.520
Our friends are
very interested in your business.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.960
I am the product for sale, here,
not the manager.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.800
Our friends want to know

52:44.800 --> 52:47.840
what the fuck your business
is doing in our town.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.120
You know, the people
you're talking about

52:51.120 --> 52:54.160
would not agree
that this is your town.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.480
They would say
that it is their town now.

53:09.200 --> 53:12.720
"Conchita: brunette.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.400
"Anal without, deep throat,

53:15.400 --> 53:17.400
"there's nothing
she won't do for fun."

53:22.720 --> 53:25.200
Look, you can go upmarket.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.160
Yeah?

53:27.160 --> 53:31.720
Girls in beautiful dresses,
fancy restaurants, wealthy clients.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.480
You don't have to suffer like this.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.640
If the pimps find out
about this conversation,

53:37.640 --> 53:40.160
I will suffer more than
you can possibly imagine.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.360
What's your real name?

53:52.560 --> 53:53.880
Conchita.

53:59.760 --> 54:00.800

54:11.600 --> 54:13.040
Yes, Liam?

54:13.040 --> 54:15.960
Boss, on the Romanian job,
the mobile phones have moved

54:15.960 --> 54:17.280
from Irish to UK codes,

54:17.280 --> 54:21.280
and the website kindly confirms
that both pages were paid for

54:21.280 --> 54:22.920
on the same credit card.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.920
In Ionut Ilie's name?

54:24.920 --> 54:26.840
Yep.

54:26.840 --> 54:29.360
Good. Now we follow the money.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.560
Sorry I'm late, chaps. No worries.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.720
Eyes down, never draw
attention to yourself.

54:34.720 --> 54:36.760
Every hotel, the same rules.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.800
Here is Isabella.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.160
There's your hundred.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.440
You two have fun now.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.560
It's a nice room.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.080
So, what do you want?

55:25.040 --> 55:26.200
Just to talk.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.560
Hold on, all right,
I've paid my money,

55:38.560 --> 55:40.240
I just want to talk.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.800
Have you got a daughter?

55:53.000 --> 55:54.320
Go home, arsehole.

55:55.720 --> 55:59.600
And when you look at her,
think of me.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.360
Marked notes handed over.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.080
You OK?

56:27.840 --> 56:30.200
Just took me by surprise,
that's all.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.520
Was she scared?

56:33.120 --> 56:34.400
She was angry.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.760
Targets are leaving the hotel.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.680
Copy that. That was quick.

56:47.640 --> 56:49.960
Walking east on Derry Street.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.360
Roger that.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.480
The others love to steal our money.

56:54.480 --> 56:55.640
Police love to find it.

56:55.640 --> 56:58.880
So whenever it's busy,
you need to send someone down here

56:58.880 --> 57:01.240
every couple of hours,
with protection.

57:01.240 --> 57:03.160
Why are you telling me all this?

57:03.160 --> 57:05.440
Ionut is expanding into Scandinavia.

57:05.440 --> 57:08.240
So, one day, Blind One,
you could be just like me.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.200
Go on, pay it in.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.160
Cashier number one, please.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.920
Hi, there.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.880
Thank you.

57:34.920 --> 57:38.720
Hold it. Now we send a picture
to Ionut,

57:38.720 --> 57:40.920
to prove we sent him the money.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.600
So that's more than £100,000.

57:51.600 --> 57:55.720
Yeah. All via money exchanges
in Belfast, Dublin,

57:55.720 --> 57:57.480
Galway, Cork, and Stockholm.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.520
All registered
to the same IP address.

57:59.520 --> 58:03.160
That IP address belongs
to Mr Ionut Ilie.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.280
Who flew, this morning to...
Stockholm.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.880
Just when you think
you're getting close.

58:08.880 --> 58:11.080
I'll speak to the Swedish boys.

58:11.080 --> 58:14.400
And here's Daniela putting money
into various Italian branches,

58:14.400 --> 58:15.720
five years ago.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.080
When she'll only have been 13.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.600
When I was little, I wanted
to grow up to be a princess.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.600
One day, I'm going to have
a little house in the forest.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.440
Where I can have dogs...

58:49.760 --> 58:51.160
..and chickens...

58:55.120 --> 58:56.840
..and live there with my boyfriend.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.480
I know you still think
he's coming for you.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.320
He did this to prove
I'm his little star.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.880
He branded you.

59:21.880 --> 59:23.360
Be kind, Ana.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.880
I'll get you out of here, one day.

59:48.040 --> 59:49.640
I'm going to Sweden.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.400
You could come, too.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.120
An alert from the airline.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.080
She's in seat 33C.

They never just run.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.240
So what's she doing there?

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.080
22 minutes from arriving alone
in Stockholm

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.920
to picking up her first booking.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.680
Maybe Swedish police
can get a statement out of her.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.960
The pimps allow her to travel
round Europe on her own.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.280
She's obediently going
about her work for them,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280
on her own. She could walk away,
but she doesn't.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.000
That's how deep the control gets.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.240

Natalia? Is that you?

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.960
It's Declan.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.360
Declan, baby.

We don't see enough of you.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.880
Well, you're in luck.
I'm in Belfast today.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120
An outcall? Eh?

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.800
Of course, why not?

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.000
What, oh, oh, you mean like a hotel?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yes, that will be lovely.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.600
I'll be there in five.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.360
I have an outcall.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.840
Oh, wow. Glasses.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.360
It's a look!

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.080
So, will we get that hotel?

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.640
I mean, it's going to have
to be a cheap one, though.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.240
I'm not going to a hotel.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.360
Will I just take you back now?
I'm not going back.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.600
Ah, you can't really want
to give all this up?

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.280
All the fun, and the money?

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.320
I mean, everything I earn,
I'm spending on you -

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.680
and that's just me.
I don't get your money.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.360
I don't get anybody's money.
The pimps keep it all -

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.360
and what was the
other word you used?

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.640
All right, don't kick off!
Fun?! Fun?!

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.920
All right!

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.960
It's quite nice just sitting here.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.120
It's quite nice just
having a wee drive together,

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.440

Look, it's all very well you
dumping yourself on me...

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.200
..but they're threatening
to tell my family.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.520
They only have your phone number,
they cannot find out where you live.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.120
Well, that's easy for you to say.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.800
My mum will kill me

Look, you'll be safe in here.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.960
Sleep in my mum's car.
She has a dog blanket in the back.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.640
If it was so bad,
why did you never just leave?

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.040
I was too scared...

I must've been mad
to bring you here.

What if...
What if you take me into town

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.640
and we get a hotel?
I don't have money for hotels.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.320
A flat, though,
a flat would be better.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.720
A flat would pay for itself.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.520
A fancy one,
and you working out of it.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.240
Think of the money we'd make, huh?

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.040
I mean, what else are
you any good for, huh?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.000
Get in the fucking car!

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:00.960
I can take her back to Romania,

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.760
I might still get
good money for her.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.800
She's past her best.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.399
If nobody wants to buy her,

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:14.080
then the obvious destination
is Dubai.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.960
They love girls like her

My wife has a theory.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.640
Ana?

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.240
Thanks for calling us.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.720
I just want... They have a girl.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.160
A slave.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.120
So young, so small.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.320
A star, branded here, on her wrist.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.120
They call her Skinny,
but her name is Daniela.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.080
You saw her.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.440
You saw her the day you came,
saw, left and did nothing.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.400
Is she in Sweden?

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.440
Erm, we can't give
you that information, I'm sorry.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.360
So, you tell me nothing and want me
to tell you everything?

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.360
Ana.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.360
This belongs to a man
from my country called Ionut Ilie.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.000
All his contacts...

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.040
..all his history.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.280
We can put him
behind bars if you help us.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.520
Ana, you were brave enough
to come here.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.520
You're brave enough
to tell your story.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.960
But I'm not brave.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.160
I'm terrified.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.280
Because they will come back for me,
and you will still do nothing.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.760
People need to know this story.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.800
We are everywhere.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.600
People only have to look.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.960
Do it for the other women, then.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.320
Do it for Daniela.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.480
I'll tell you my story.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.400
I'll tell anyone who will listen.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.360
Then let's see
if it changes anything.
