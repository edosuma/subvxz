00:41.215 --> 00:43.106
Bedtime's 10:30,

00:43.130 --> 00:45.151
no matter what he says.

00:45.175 --> 00:50.180
And, oh vegetables, can't go
six weeks on pizza, okay?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.724
And you remember
he's allergic to

00:52.748 --> 00:54.595
shellfish? To shellfish, I know.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.250
It's Vermont, people don't
go for the oysters.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.513
I can't believe you're
going to Vermont.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.473
I couldn't drag you there when
we were married, I tried.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.171
You did.

01:05.194 --> 01:07.391
You're not flipping
again, right?

01:07.415 --> 01:09.765
No, it's just over and
out, six weeks tops.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.769
Is there a rule for
phone time for Finn?

01:14.813 --> 01:16.443
You're kidding right?

01:16.467 --> 01:18.663
After his latest stunt?

01:20.297 --> 01:23.668
His phone time is zero, the
phone stays in New York.

01:23.692 --> 01:26.149
I hate you. Finn,
you cannot talk.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.280
Calm down, I'll talk to him.
To your mother...

01:27.304 --> 01:29.326
What? Calm down, I'll...

01:29.350 --> 01:30.283
We don't need to do this.

01:30.307 --> 01:33.093
Calm down, are you kidding me?

01:34.442 --> 01:36.159
You are not here!

01:36.183 --> 01:39.360
You have no idea what's
going on here, you don't!

01:41.188 --> 01:42.861
I'm just trying
to keep him safe,

01:42.885 --> 01:45.061
and I am all alone in this!

01:46.193 --> 01:49.650
Up against the internet,
random shootings,

01:49.674 --> 01:52.740
other people's bad kids,
the planet dying,

01:52.764 --> 01:54.481
and now this President?

01:54.505 --> 01:55.917
What am I supposed to...

01:55.941 --> 01:57.987
Okay, yeah,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.357
go ahead you tell me
what I'm supposed

02:00.381 --> 02:01.686
to say to a little boy?

02:04.515 --> 02:05.515
I don't know.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.997
You're right, I don't know.

02:19.835 --> 02:24.405
Hey bucko, it's time to go!

03:44.833 --> 03:46.550
What's the matter?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.378
The smell!

03:48.402 --> 03:50.380
Oh that's just fresh air.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.599
Vermont in May, doesn't
get any fresher.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.035
It's cow shit.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.864
Yeah, the freshest though.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.586
Dad, don't.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.893
No you're right, let's
sulk, that's more fun.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.398
There's nothing here.
You've been banished.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.834
People who have been
banished get sent

04:09.858 --> 04:12.164
to places where there's
nothing, that's how it works.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.493
Look I know this is not
your choice, so already

04:16.517 --> 04:18.519
we're off on the
wrong, you know...

04:19.694 --> 04:21.192
I talked to your mother
about what happened,

04:21.216 --> 04:23.282
I'm not even going to
go into all that but,

04:23.306 --> 04:25.613
all I know is that I've
never seen her so upset.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.704
I just don't want this trip
to be a disappointment.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.813
I'm already disappointed.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.274
Yeah well, me too.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.601
Why? I guess I was hoping

04:37.625 --> 04:40.081
I'd catch you on
the 12 side of 12,

04:40.105 --> 04:41.672
instead of the 13 side of 12.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.899
'Cause the kid I used to know,
would have loved this place.

05:43.778 --> 05:44.778
Whose house?

05:45.780 --> 05:46.780
I bought it.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.784
Wait, it's yours?

05:51.046 --> 05:52.676
But didn't someone
else hire you to like

05:52.700 --> 05:54.286
fix it up or something?

05:54.310 --> 05:56.268
Yeah, that's what I
told your mother.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.248
You lied to her?
Yes a little bit,

06:00.272 --> 06:02.623
more of a fib really. Why?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.777
'Cause I'm flipping it,
and your mother hates it

06:06.801 --> 06:08.779
when I flip houses, she
thinks it's gambling.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.674
Flipping it like, over?

06:11.675 --> 06:15.438
No, it means, you
buy it for cheap,

06:15.462 --> 06:19.422
put a little money in it so
it looks nicer, worth more,

06:20.641 --> 06:22.445
then you try to sell
it again for a profit.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.080
What if it doesn't flip
over and you can't sell it?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.711
It'll flip.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.196
I'm gonna cut my hand off.
That's exactly what

06:35.220 --> 06:36.328
your mother said.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.808
Screw her what does she know!

06:37.832 --> 06:40.985
Hey!

06:41.009 --> 06:42.009
Shit.

06:45.579 --> 06:46.579
Yeah?

06:48.233 --> 06:50.497
What, oh right,
Rick, the wiring.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.585
So what...

06:53.195 --> 06:55.129
Uh great, that's great.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.742
Yeah I'll leave the
bulkhead open,

06:58.766 --> 07:00.202
the fuse box is right in...

07:01.421 --> 07:03.945
Okay, great, do your thing.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.251
All right thanks, bye.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.417
Gonna take her side now?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.833
I'm not taking anyone's side.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.508
But your mother does
have some valid points,

07:25.532 --> 07:27.858
you have to admit. She
broke into my computer.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.927
It came with rules,
and you knew that.

07:32.016 --> 07:36.736
Dad, imagine the only
thing between you,

07:36.760 --> 07:40.784
and pretty much every answer
to every question you have,

07:40.808 --> 07:44.483
right, is a door, you're
not supposed to open,

07:44.507 --> 07:46.204
one with a real
crappy lock on it?

07:47.858 --> 07:51.688
Wouldn't you break the crappy
lock and at least take a peek?

07:56.737 --> 07:58.608
How much of a peek did you take?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.773
Tell me people got
chopped up here.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.384
I don't know, sorry
to disappoint.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.778
That's something they'd
have to disclose.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.345
What's disclosed?

08:20.369 --> 08:21.694
That means they'd have
to tell me if somebody

08:21.718 --> 08:23.546
got chopped here and
they didn't tell me.

08:24.765 --> 08:25.809
Damn.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.377
Whoa.

08:40.693 --> 08:42.957
Something smells nasty in here.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.114
I'd say when we open the
flue in this thing,

08:50.138 --> 08:51.855
we're gonna get a
little present.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.577
What kind of present? A
furry, dead present.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.060
Plumbing's not fixed, yet.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.411
Let's not fix it.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.998
Then you won't try to cook.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.871
Oh nice burn. Yeah, nice burn

09:07.895 --> 09:10.874
like every food you ever...
Now you lost it.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.093
Don't push it, never
double-down on a good burn.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.313
Right. Microwave,

09:15.337 --> 09:17.968
number for the pizza
guy, all we need.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.210
All we need.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.672
Rain is starting to
come through this guy

09:26.696 --> 09:27.784
and rot the wood.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.789
Gonna have to switch those out.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.899
Like, for horses.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.947
Yeah, there probably was, once.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.560
We should turn this into
something cool like,

10:05.343 --> 10:06.388
a movie theater.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.019
Who needs horses?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.804
Well your mom had
horses growing up.

10:11.828 --> 10:12.849
Really?

10:12.873 --> 10:15.025
Yeah, I never much
cared for 'em,

10:15.049 --> 10:17.027
but she loved the damn things.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.095
Probably still does.

10:19.706 --> 10:23.033
Right, she had these
little pictures,

10:23.057 --> 10:23.947
Yeah, that she
painted on on her...

10:23.971 --> 10:25.862
The walls, little animals.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.975
What, I remember things.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.281
It's been a while but I do.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.316
Did you...

10:45.340 --> 10:46.491
Is this my stuff?

10:46.515 --> 10:47.884
Yeah.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.189
I had some things
sent up from storage.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.998
I wanted you to feel
at home I guess.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.262
What? Nothing.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.939
No you don't feel at home,
it's stupid and you hate it.

10:59.963 --> 11:00.984
Look at you, you
totally hate it.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.879
Dad, it's just...

11:05.926 --> 11:06.926
A little too young.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.688
I asked your mom what
she thought you'd like.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.908
She doesn't know everything.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.542
I can't wait to tell her that.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.112
You still like those things?

11:19.026 --> 11:20.027
Sure.

11:21.637 --> 11:26.076
I can't do 'em, they
give me a headache.

11:27.948 --> 11:31.231
It's kind of like, you
have to look at it,

11:31.255 --> 11:33.886
like you're looking at
something far away,

11:33.910 --> 11:34.998
even though it's up close.

11:42.658 --> 11:43.658
I can't do it.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.968
What's the picture of?
I'm not telling.

11:50.971 --> 11:53.669
I'll get you some more
grown up decorations soon.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.084
Maybe a gun closet and
some booby posters.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.108
Whoa easy!

12:03.940 --> 12:06.464
Well here's another wrong
we have to make right.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.338
We're the house
doctors, you and me.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.429
Get in there where the bad
parts are and make 'em good.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.032
Turn this into some place
someone would want to live.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.838
So these, are the guts.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.408
And she's got really bad guts.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.674
Bad pipes, bad wires...

13:29.939 --> 13:31.245
And this...

13:33.421 --> 13:34.509
This is the heart.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.098
Here she's got a bad heart too.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.210
It's barely pumping.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.562
Even though I can't find a
single thing wrong with it.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.152
Which is bad news for us
because up here in May

13:49.176 --> 13:51.197
it's cold as balls
and we do not ha...

13:53.049 --> 13:55.811
, what's happening?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.160
Sh!

13:57.184 --> 13:59.577
Sh!

14:03.930 --> 14:05.211
Jesus Christ the hell are you?

14:05.235 --> 14:06.343
Wait wait, wait, wait!

14:06.367 --> 14:09.912
Just, the electrician!

14:09.936 --> 14:12.218
You said to come in through the
bulkhead and I just thought,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.480
sorry, I'm sorry. Jesus Christ!

14:13.504 --> 14:16.135
I, died for a second.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.409
Don't even think about it.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.237
Why, you don't even inhale.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.848
I'm not the best
father, but I'm not

14:32.872 --> 14:34.308
trying to win a prize about it.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.180
Better settle for
second-hand, chief!

14:39.226 --> 14:42.185
So uh, it's a mess in there.

14:43.186 --> 14:46.252
You got broken fuses,
outdated everything.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.559
Awesome. Plus you got a main

14:48.583 --> 14:50.909
line clipped on the
outside, but uh,

14:50.933 --> 14:51.954
I've already taken care of that.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.303
Wait, clipped?

14:53.327 --> 14:56.001
Like someone cut it
clipped, like on purpose?

14:56.025 --> 14:57.025
Looks like.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.310
Kids maybe, or uh, I don't know,

15:00.334 --> 15:02.965
but like I said, taken care of.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.488
Thanks.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.035
Well this is Finn by the way.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.274
Louis.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.972
Hi.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.626
I'm also your neighbor,
uh, closest thing you got

15:12.650 --> 15:16.065
out here anyway, about a quarter
mile down South Street.

15:16.089 --> 15:19.024
It's a bit far to run for
a stick of butter but uh,

15:19.048 --> 15:20.441
anything you ever need just...

15:25.098 --> 15:26.708
Something wrong? No.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.730
You mind if we move
up to the porch.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.210
It's getting kind of chilly?

15:31.234 --> 15:32.757
I prefer it here actually.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.978
You don't much like this place.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.590
I, I don't like it no.

15:41.418 --> 15:42.418
Why not?

15:44.030 --> 15:47.923
Don't worry, we're not moving
in, we're flipping it over.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.576
I don't know

15:49.600 --> 15:51.274
what they told you already...

15:51.298 --> 15:53.580
Just that nobody got chopped up.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.171
That's right, boring...

15:56.303 --> 15:59.369
So they didn't tell
you about her?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.110
I guess they wouldn't have to.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.134
About what?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.313
Lady who lived here
when I was a kid.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.402
Um...

16:10.404 --> 16:11.404
She died?

16:13.537 --> 16:15.254
Yes!

16:15.278 --> 16:16.212
Let's see if you're saying that

16:16.236 --> 16:17.822
one o'clock in the morning.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.913
She was the kind of lady
that kids would call a,

16:21.937 --> 16:23.286
witch, or whatever.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.525
But that's normal, it's just the

16:25.549 --> 16:28.528
usual small town stuff, right?

16:28.552 --> 16:31.425
Uh, cute, or whatever.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.298
But this was not cute.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.433
What'd she do? Uh...

16:40.390 --> 16:41.391
Go on.

16:42.914 --> 16:47.136
I guess it was a good house
once, back before I was born.

16:49.095 --> 16:52.533
But for me it was
always her house.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.428
She did have a family back
then, husband and a son but,

16:58.452 --> 17:01.498
they died on the farm, badly,

17:02.630 --> 17:05.042
got caught up in the hay bailer.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.872
Nasty stuff.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.396
Rumor was it she
done it herself.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.074
Why would she do that?

17:14.903 --> 17:19.907
Well, most people I think,
generally try and do good but,

17:21.997 --> 17:23.867
this woman was, the other way.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.050
But I'll tell you this, she
liked that people were scared.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.663
She liked it, being
in your head.

17:37.317 --> 17:41.732
And what really scared me, was
seeing how scared my mom was.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.647
Now that I got a kid
of my own I get it,

17:43.671 --> 17:47.259
she knew something that
bad was that close.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.676
And she couldn't keep me safe.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.265
She used to sit, right up there
in the window in the front,

17:53.289 --> 17:54.289
just watching.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.835
One summer we all got
to noticing that uh,

17:57.859 --> 17:59.600
she never seemed to
leave that spot.

18:00.731 --> 18:01.731
Day and night.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.736
So finally someone caught
wise and called it in and,

18:07.086 --> 18:08.324
sure enough, she'd been dead

18:08.348 --> 18:10.611
up there, three, four weeks.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.571
I think they said it
was a heart failure.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.725
What was her name?

18:18.749 --> 18:20.858
What? Her name.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.381
You never said it.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.626
Ha, I guess I don't
much like saying it.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.934
Her name was, Lydia.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.185
What are those?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.577
Something wrong?

18:44.601 --> 18:47.493
Yep, I got a hole in my heart.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.365
Well, obviously.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.368
No really.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.197
It's a tiny one, a lot
of people have them.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.676
Since when have you had it?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.983
Since forever, but I only
found out about it last year

18:59.007 --> 19:00.637
when I was in California.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.073
Can it get bad?

19:02.097 --> 19:04.621
It sounds bad, can you die?

19:05.753 --> 19:06.860
There's a better chance
of us being hit by

19:06.884 --> 19:08.906
an asteroid while we sleep.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.342
Is it cold in your room?

19:10.366 --> 19:12.431
As balls. Okay there's blankets

19:12.455 --> 19:14.041
next to...

19:14.065 --> 19:17.001
Where did you hear that,
did you hear me say that?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.394
Yes.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.462
Well...

19:21.508 --> 19:23.703
Okay there's some extra blankets

19:23.727 --> 19:25.052
next to your bed.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.600
We'll get on that
furnace tomorrow.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.361
I'm next door if you need me.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.385
I'm fine.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.476
I'll leave my door open.
I'm fine!

21:00.041 --> 21:02.062
Ah!

21:03.523 --> 21:05.283
What is that?

21:05.307 --> 21:07.657
That is a big fat old dead crow.

21:11.661 --> 21:14.597
There you go no rush, just
see the line in your head,

21:14.621 --> 21:16.555
and don't think too hard.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.846
There you go, nice.

21:24.413 --> 21:25.413
Nice.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.408
Shit.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.645
Who's there?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.569
What's with the lamp?

22:34.788 --> 22:36.113
Oh nothing.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.810
I heard you talking to someone.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.986
Just to myself.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.010
You know...

22:43.536 --> 22:44.536
I'm a little uh...

22:45.712 --> 22:46.756
Dad.

22:47.714 --> 22:48.758
What is it?

22:50.325 --> 22:52.762
Do you think there's something
wrong with the house?

22:54.721 --> 22:55.721
Maybe.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.462
Do you?

22:58.420 --> 23:00.659
I thought I saw someone
in the mirror.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.683
What kind of someone?

23:02.946 --> 23:03.946
I think a lady.

23:05.601 --> 23:06.646
Which mirror?

23:10.563 --> 23:11.912
Oh I'm sure it was just...

23:14.436 --> 23:17.763
What did she look like?
I don't know, it was

23:17.787 --> 23:20.549
too fast, it was
like, a magic eye.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.115
A what? You know,

23:22.139 --> 23:24.901
the picture in my room, the one
with the crazy patternings?

23:24.925 --> 23:27.860
It was kind of like
that, it was like,

23:27.884 --> 23:29.645
you only see it for
a second, then...

23:29.669 --> 23:30.670
You lose it.

23:35.239 --> 23:37.740
Do you think that it's her?

23:37.764 --> 23:39.089
Who?

23:39.113 --> 23:42.135
Lydia! Why are you whispering?

23:42.159 --> 23:43.159
I don't know.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.729
Have you seen something too?

23:49.079 --> 23:50.079
What?

23:53.823 --> 23:54.823
That's the spot.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.658
Do you think it's the
same chair she died in?

24:03.659 --> 24:05.507
No of course not.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.537
You want to leave?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.061
Well maybe we should though.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.237
I'm not scared.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.739
You want to sleep in my room?

24:20.763 --> 24:22.243
You don't have to be brave.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.638
I said I'm not scared.
I know, but...

24:27.944 --> 24:30.270
I'll leave my door open.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.948
Dad. Just in case.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.659
Time to get up bucko.

26:14.921 --> 26:15.965
Not yet.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.317
I-I had this dream.

26:22.842 --> 26:25.385
It's still coming back to me uh,

26:25.409 --> 26:28.301
I was asking someone
if we could stay here.

26:28.325 --> 26:33.156
Stay? I asked her, who was it?

26:34.288 --> 26:36.899
Wait... Like with mom too?

26:37.813 --> 26:39.878
Oh god I remember now!

26:39.902 --> 26:41.401
Lydia!

26:41.425 --> 26:42.425
It was Lydia!

26:43.950 --> 26:48.321
And then, then she showed me
what would happen to you...

26:48.345 --> 26:49.477
You just...

26:53.916 --> 26:54.961
Dad?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.493
Hey Finn will you give
me a hand with this?

27:50.581 --> 27:52.148
Finn! What?

27:53.367 --> 27:54.736
We're gonna pick this
up and carry it back

27:54.760 --> 27:56.239
to the house, okay? Okay.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.504
One, two, three up!

28:10.776 --> 28:12.603
You seem quiet, everything okay?

28:14.562 --> 28:16.018
I'm fine.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.759
Hey there's some mud up ahead.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.219
All right we'll go around it.

28:21.264 --> 28:22.875
You know I've been meaning to...

28:24.224 --> 28:26.332
If you want to talk about
anything you saw when you

28:26.356 --> 28:28.987
took your little you know,
peek at the world wide web...

28:29.011 --> 28:31.076
Please, no, I'm fine.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.556
We don't need to talk
about this right now.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.905
Mmm I'm just saying maybe
there might be some

28:33.929 --> 28:35.428
things I can set the
record straight on,

28:35.452 --> 28:37.735
because there's a lot of
stuff out there that can

28:37.759 --> 28:40.956
give you the...

28:40.980 --> 28:42.633
All right, okay I got!

28:44.635 --> 28:47.595
Thank you.

28:55.298 --> 28:58.016
Oh, no... Wait I
thought you said you

28:58.040 --> 29:00.671
walked around this?
Yeah I tried but

29:00.695 --> 29:02.499
there's just way too much...
Okay stop no no no

29:02.523 --> 29:03.805
this is bad, back up!

29:03.829 --> 29:05.371
Finn, wait ah...

29:05.395 --> 29:08.113
My foot's stuck!
All right hold on.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.638
Where's your, you got your boot?

29:13.055 --> 29:16.121
All my clothes...

29:34.076 --> 29:36.576
So did you look at
that kind of stuff?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.778
What kind of stuff?
Like on the internet?

29:42.955 --> 29:44.106
Thought you didn't want
to talk about that?

29:44.130 --> 29:46.238
Just, never mind...

29:46.262 --> 29:49.091
No no it's just, it's, look...

29:50.353 --> 29:52.854
It's perfectly normal to want
to look at girls, or boys

29:52.878 --> 29:54.551
or whatever... No oh my god Dad

29:54.575 --> 29:55.552
not that kind of stuff!

29:55.576 --> 29:58.100
I just mean like scarier stuff.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.801
Wait did you see
something violent?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.372
Did you see someone get killed?

30:13.463 --> 30:14.987
Where did you see that?

30:16.162 --> 30:20.185
The news, I think, it
was just this guy,

30:20.209 --> 30:22.492
and he was getting his
head chopped off,

30:22.516 --> 30:25.408
and he was screaming, or
at least trying to...

30:25.432 --> 30:27.236
God dammit!

30:27.260 --> 30:29.934
God dammit!

30:29.958 --> 30:32.874
Jesus!

30:34.267 --> 30:35.267
Look Finn...

30:38.184 --> 30:40.273
The world's kind of a
sick place I guess.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.276
Jesus...

30:45.191 --> 30:46.496
Here help me with this thing.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.697
Did you ask your mom about it?

30:53.721 --> 30:54.721
Well...

30:57.377 --> 31:00.859
I think so, she was
just really mad, and,

31:02.861 --> 31:05.317
it was really late, I
was supposed to be

31:05.341 --> 31:08.605
sleeping but I, snuck out.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.194
Only because she was crying.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.066
She was on the phone
with someone crying,

31:15.090 --> 31:17.547
and, I don't know
who it was, but,

31:17.571 --> 31:21.029
she said she was scared
that I knew that the

31:21.053 --> 31:26.014
world had gone all bad and
that it would end and, die.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.016
Why your mom...

31:31.498 --> 31:34.196
I, I guess that's
what she thinks.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.200
She needs to get out of
the city, you both do.

31:40.768 --> 31:44.226
Do you think, that
the world will...

31:44.250 --> 31:45.250
No.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.558
Would you tell me if you did?

31:51.822 --> 31:53.172
No, probably not.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.349
You'd lie? Yeah.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.919
So, I'm not allowed
to lie but you are?

32:02.007 --> 32:03.007
Yep.

32:05.010 --> 32:08.274
And mom? All the time she lies.

32:09.536 --> 32:10.536
My god!

32:12.321 --> 32:13.995
Do you feel bad about it?

32:14.019 --> 32:19.024
Mph, all parents do it,
good ones, crappy ones.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.679
We tell you everything's
okay when it's not okay.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.335
We tell you we're strong
when we're not strong.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.271
We'll tell you there's
no spinach in it

32:29.295 --> 32:31.360
when there's spinach in it.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.384
I knew it.

32:34.387 --> 32:37.477
Anything, so you don't know...

32:39.827 --> 32:40.827
Don't know what?

32:47.617 --> 32:50.490
That you aren't
safe, not really.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.777
More, more more!

32:57.801 --> 33:00.674
What else did you lie
about you lying liar?

33:02.154 --> 33:05.263
Okay so, remember that
automatic dog feeder thing

33:05.287 --> 33:08.334
you made for the science
fair all those years ago?

33:09.248 --> 33:12.183
I said it was great and
you were so clever?

33:12.207 --> 33:15.012
Yeah?

33:15.036 --> 33:16.709
Well that thing was terrible.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.059
It never worked,

33:18.083 --> 33:20.694
the dog hated it, so,

33:22.130 --> 33:24.979
even though you are pretty
much the cleverest,

33:25.003 --> 33:27.309
that time you were
very unclever.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.358
So we pretended,
I mean, we lied.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.357
Right keep pushing, keep
pushing, pull straight down.

33:41.845 --> 33:45.458
Steady, eh, perfect!

33:49.940 --> 33:50.940
You mad?

33:52.552 --> 33:55.468
From now on no bullshit
between us, okay?

33:58.340 --> 33:59.385
No bullshit.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.692
Are you really gonna
sell the house?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.458
Why would you even think...

34:09.482 --> 34:12.156
Do you... No see
that's bullshit!

34:12.179 --> 34:14.376
No no that's, that's stalling,
stalling's different.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.445
Stalling to think of
the right bullshit.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.143
Are you really gonna sell it?

34:23.277 --> 34:25.672
I hope not to, that's
the best I can...

34:27.543 --> 34:29.521
How did you even know?
I don't know,

34:29.545 --> 34:33.549
it's just everything,
like, my room,

34:34.855 --> 34:38.268
and all this stuff and,
all the time in this...

34:48.956 --> 34:50.739
Did someone come in?

35:10.195 --> 35:13.913
Do you think that...

35:13.937 --> 35:15.983
That sounds like it
came from the basement.

35:17.289 --> 35:18.289
You okay?

35:19.029 --> 35:20.029
Let's go see.

35:26.341 --> 35:27.231
You should go
outside and wait...

35:27.255 --> 35:28.517
Let's go see!

35:34.697 --> 35:35.805
What?

35:35.829 --> 35:36.829
Do you feel that?

35:37.744 --> 35:38.744
A breeze?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.574
It's hot air. So?

35:43.228 --> 35:44.403
That means the heat's on.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.125
I don't believe it.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.397
Well, I guess it's a good thing.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.162
But, how'd it go on?

36:35.323 --> 36:36.561
You know what?

36:36.585 --> 36:37.585
We skipped lunch.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.261
What do you say we
get out of here,

36:40.285 --> 36:42.437
go get some fresh air and maybe,

36:42.461 --> 36:43.960
go to the pizza
instead of inviting

36:43.984 --> 36:45.420
the pizza here for a change?

36:49.990 --> 36:53.448
Go wash up, and grab
your rain coat.

37:04.874 --> 37:07.877
Ow, Jesus!

37:10.402 --> 37:12.510
Dad! Hold on a second.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.666
Dad! What?

37:18.192 --> 37:19.192
Her.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.954
What should we do?

37:50.442 --> 37:51.442
Stay here.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.679
Excuse me...

38:27.609 --> 38:28.609
Excuse me Miss?

38:32.658 --> 38:33.659
I can see you.

38:45.671 --> 38:46.715
Go outside.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.067
Go downstairs Finn, now!

39:25.754 --> 39:30.759
What the hell...

40:02.661 --> 40:03.705
Hello?

40:06.186 --> 40:07.274
Say her name.

40:14.847 --> 40:15.847
Lydia.

40:21.462 --> 40:26.424
I don't think...

40:26.989 --> 40:27.989
Stay!

41:59.952 --> 42:02.583
All right I'm doing this.
What, no!

42:02.607 --> 42:03.608
Dad don't!

42:08.264 --> 42:10.025
Hi hey there Bev. I
was just thinking

42:10.049 --> 42:11.461
about you two.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.681
Uh so listen I'm gonna,

42:13.705 --> 42:16.771
tell you the longer version of
this sometime real soon but,

42:16.795 --> 42:18.623
something's happened. Jesus.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.104
Is he hurt? Just listen.

42:23.323 --> 42:25.847
I'm putting Finn on the
bus in the morning,

42:26.805 --> 42:28.783
to you, back to New York.

42:28.807 --> 42:30.611
Oh no Dad please! He'll
be at Port Authority

42:30.635 --> 42:33.744
by 3:30, look I'm
sorry, this is not the

42:33.768 --> 42:35.509
way I wanted this to happen but,

42:37.555 --> 42:40.403
conditions just aren't
safe in the house and I,

42:40.427 --> 42:43.430
I, I don't know how
to make them safe I,

42:45.127 --> 42:47.652
I don't, I'm sorry.

42:49.871 --> 42:50.871
Okay.

42:52.221 --> 42:53.221
Okay?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.703
What else am I gonna say?

42:57.749 --> 42:58.749
Thank you.

43:01.056 --> 43:04.122
I'll text you details in the
morning once he's on the road.

43:04.146 --> 43:06.758
- Okay bye.
- Bye.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.004
Come on don't look
at me like that.

43:16.028 --> 43:18.006
What do you expect me to do, ,

43:18.030 --> 43:19.398
what if something happened?

43:19.422 --> 43:20.422
How would I...

43:22.295 --> 43:23.881
Do you want to go back in there?

43:23.905 --> 43:25.230
No...

43:25.254 --> 43:27.581
I don't know. Well so then what?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.713
Wha, we can't both leave
as much as I'd love that

43:29.737 --> 43:32.174
but bucko, I'm all in.

43:33.436 --> 43:35.003
I bet the house
literally, and...

43:35.961 --> 43:37.199
Look I know you don't
understand this...

43:37.223 --> 43:39.810
Let's both stay then!
Absolutely not!

43:39.834 --> 43:41.333
It could be the best house,

43:41.357 --> 43:42.639
you know that mom would love it!

43:42.663 --> 43:43.988
That's what I thought
when I first saw it.

43:44.012 --> 43:46.275
Finn, no.

43:49.844 --> 43:53.171
So what, you're gonna
sell it to someone?

43:53.195 --> 43:56.827
Just lie, give it to
some poor family...

43:56.851 --> 43:58.394
I don't know, please!

43:58.418 --> 44:01.963
You shouldn't go in alone,
it's worse if you go in alone.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.424
Please Dad! I won't
sleep in there.

44:05.991 --> 44:08.994
I'll work during the day,
and I'll crash at a motel.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.038
I'll be fine.

44:12.737 --> 44:14.628
I know how to survive
living for a couple weeks

44:14.652 --> 44:17.045
with someone who doesn't
want me there, believe me.

44:18.003 --> 44:19.981
Didn't you hear her?

44:20.005 --> 44:21.112
Who?

44:21.136 --> 44:22.136
Lydia?

44:23.443 --> 44:25.967
She doesn't want you out,
she wants you to stay.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.949
Well then we'll get
along fine, her and me,

44:31.973 --> 44:33.975
'cause that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

44:55.910 --> 44:56.910
Hey.

44:58.086 --> 44:59.914
Come on, I'll show you my room.

45:11.230 --> 45:12.990
You and I got tot
get on the level

45:13.014 --> 45:14.102
with a few things.

45:15.103 --> 45:16.975
Well, have we not
been on the level?

45:18.150 --> 45:19.150
Nope.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.500
Not really.

45:24.591 --> 45:26.811
You know that first
day I come over,

45:28.029 --> 45:30.791
told you about the
wire's been clipped,

45:30.815 --> 45:32.033
and the power had gone dead.

45:33.818 --> 45:34.818
It was me cut 'em.

45:36.081 --> 45:37.125
What, you?

45:40.128 --> 45:41.128
Why?

45:42.087 --> 45:44.698
I cut 'em four or
five years back uh,

45:46.308 --> 45:48.615
something didn't
seem right and...

45:52.358 --> 45:53.533
I seen her looking out.

45:55.013 --> 45:56.536
So you've... Off and on.

45:57.929 --> 45:59.234
Through the years, yeah.

46:01.671 --> 46:05.110
Didn't, more than sort of
spook me at first but,

46:07.112 --> 46:11.832
then I noticed, a few
days after I'd seen her,

46:11.856 --> 46:16.556
that she'd seen me that,
things weren't right,

46:17.687 --> 46:19.472
in, with my head and um,

46:21.039 --> 46:23.171
the worst of it was
the sleep walking.

46:24.172 --> 46:25.172
Sleep walking?

46:29.003 --> 46:31.614
I'd wake up in the road
between our houses,

46:33.225 --> 46:34.356
just standing there and...

46:36.532 --> 46:39.076
It seemed like every time
I'd be like a step closer,

46:39.100 --> 46:40.100
like she was just,

46:41.189 --> 46:43.452
trying to reel me in or
something, you know.

46:45.280 --> 46:49.565
And then uh, this one time
there was this ice storm,

46:49.589 --> 46:52.002
that knocked the grid
down for a week.

46:52.026 --> 46:55.029
But I'm sure she was still in
there but I didn't see her.

46:56.204 --> 46:59.425
And I slept, stopped
taking my walks.

47:01.557 --> 47:04.996
I got to thinking, maybe
she liked the power on.

47:07.172 --> 47:09.043
So I, I cut it.

47:12.917 --> 47:14.527
And then I had you repair it.

47:16.050 --> 47:17.835
Cursing myself the whole time.

47:20.402 --> 47:22.728
But I knew it would get done,
with me or without me,

47:22.752 --> 47:25.973
so I figured, I might
as well be the one.

47:27.627 --> 47:28.976
At least I could warn you.

47:31.283 --> 47:33.285
But I didn't, 'cause
I'm chickenshit.

47:35.243 --> 47:37.071
And uh I don't know
I guess I just,

47:38.899 --> 47:42.163
hoping it all been in my drunken
god damn skull, you know?

47:43.773 --> 47:45.297
Is that what you think now?

47:47.168 --> 47:50.476
Today I woke up, 3:30 in
the god damn morning,

47:51.956 --> 47:53.305
at the head of your driveway.

47:55.655 --> 47:58.764
You can't keep doing what
you're doing over there.

47:58.788 --> 47:59.788
I have to.

48:01.269 --> 48:02.269
What, for money?

48:03.968 --> 48:08.189
That's all she ever dreamed
of, the perfect country home.

48:09.712 --> 48:14.195
It's old and eccentric, full of
history, and strange noises.

48:15.153 --> 48:16.328
Room for horses.

48:17.590 --> 48:20.680
You're not flipping it?
I was never flipping.

48:22.290 --> 48:24.162
I was keeping it, god damn it!

48:26.120 --> 48:29.708
To surprise her or
to, convince her,

48:29.732 --> 48:32.276
I don't know, anything
to get her...

48:32.300 --> 48:33.345
She love you?

48:39.090 --> 48:40.134
If not well then,

48:46.488 --> 48:48.229
that's something you can't flip.

48:49.230 --> 48:50.860
Trust me. At least I'd have

48:50.884 --> 48:52.993
done something good, for them.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.473
You've seen the house now you
know it's Lydia's house,

48:55.497 --> 48:57.214
not yours, and it's a bad house!

48:57.238 --> 48:59.869
You said yourself, it
was a good house once.

48:59.893 --> 49:01.871
I have to think it can
be a good house again.

49:01.895 --> 49:03.244
I am telling you... Don't!

49:04.767 --> 49:07.224
She can scare the hell out
of me if she wants to,

49:07.248 --> 49:08.946
but what is she
gonna do to me huh?

49:11.122 --> 49:14.231
We're adults, we know
in the real world,

49:14.255 --> 49:16.103
nobody fills in a
death certificate,

49:16.127 --> 49:18.042
cause of death, haunted house!

49:23.047 --> 49:28.052
I just know that, whatever you
fix in that god damn house,

49:29.314 --> 49:33.318
all you're really doing,
is making her stronger.

49:46.461 --> 49:47.593
I love you.

51:33.133 --> 51:34.133
All right.

53:23.504 --> 53:24.549
Are you mad?

53:25.985 --> 53:27.267
Yes.

53:27.291 --> 53:28.640
You can't just...

53:30.468 --> 53:32.034
When did you get off the bus?

53:32.992 --> 53:35.821
Right there, just when you left.

53:38.171 --> 53:41.063
Well then you... What?

53:41.087 --> 53:42.087
Jesus Finn!

53:48.050 --> 53:50.115
Are you gonna help then?

53:50.139 --> 53:52.292
I am helping. You are.

53:52.316 --> 53:53.316
I'm the lookout.

54:02.413 --> 54:03.781
Look at this huh?

54:03.805 --> 54:04.805
Teamwork!

54:08.593 --> 54:11.093
I love your pout, I
think it's funny.

54:11.117 --> 54:12.747
Maybe if you let me s...
You're a New Yorker again

54:12.771 --> 54:16.490
by tomorrow afternoon, no debate,
don't even think about it.

54:16.514 --> 54:17.926
You and I are not gonna strap on

54:17.950 --> 54:20.233
proton packs and try to
save the whole god damn...

54:20.257 --> 54:21.519
Shut up! Hey!

54:23.042 --> 54:24.042
Watch it!

54:47.240 --> 54:48.478
I know what you're thinking.

54:48.502 --> 54:50.591
No, you really don't.

54:51.505 --> 54:52.550
I'm an asshole.

54:53.812 --> 54:57.182
You're wrong. I am?

54:57.206 --> 54:58.206
Yes.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.645
You're my favorite person.

55:04.344 --> 55:07.739
Even if maybe I don't admit
it all the time it's just,

55:09.306 --> 55:13.919
you know, and I always want
to be mad at you because,

55:14.746 --> 55:16.617
I guess Mom always is so...

55:17.836 --> 55:19.751
Really, you're my
favorite person.

55:23.624 --> 55:25.646
My favorite person
doesn't like me enough,

55:25.670 --> 55:27.933
to just, stick around you know?

55:39.727 --> 55:40.922
Finn you and your mother
mean more to me...

55:40.946 --> 55:42.663
Don't say that!

55:42.687 --> 55:44.384
No bullshit remember?

55:45.690 --> 55:47.650
If that were true then why
would you keep leaving?

55:50.825 --> 55:52.044
Because I'm a coward.

55:54.002 --> 55:57.678
It's just, Jesus Finn you...

55:57.702 --> 56:00.768
It's all so scary
you have no idea.

56:00.792 --> 56:04.554
Feeling like, I have this
completely perfect thing,

56:04.578 --> 56:07.276
'cause that's how I feel
about you, just perfect.

56:08.452 --> 56:11.648
And why in the hell
would anyone, give me a

56:11.672 --> 56:14.651
perfect god damn thing when
they should know that,

56:14.675 --> 56:16.373
all I've got are
ways to wreck it?

56:19.158 --> 56:21.378
And so I panic, and
I can't keep still.

56:23.205 --> 56:25.686
And as horrible as it
feels to miss you guys,

56:26.644 --> 56:30.363
it also feels like,
being missed is better

56:30.387 --> 56:32.582
than being there
and being hated.

56:32.606 --> 56:35.174
I wouldn't Dad, I love you.

56:42.224 --> 56:43.356
I love you too Finn!

56:50.145 --> 56:51.819
Oh Jesus.

56:51.843 --> 56:53.298
It's your mother. No!

56:53.322 --> 56:54.865
Don't answer it!

56:54.889 --> 56:57.607
Bev? Hi.

56:57.631 --> 56:58.913
I thought I'd check in.

56:58.937 --> 57:01.742
Um, I don't know what
Finn's already told you.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.308
Um, not much.

57:03.332 --> 57:05.683
He's been pretty quiet since
he got back actually.

57:06.988 --> 57:08.642
Since, what? Finn.

57:10.035 --> 57:13.342
He's been pretty quiet
since he got back today.

57:14.909 --> 57:17.888
Back where? Back home.

57:17.912 --> 57:20.804
You put him on a bus...

57:20.828 --> 57:23.546
What am I not understanding?

57:23.570 --> 57:25.224
You're saying... Are you okay?

57:26.660 --> 57:29.160
I picked him up at Port
Authority just like you asked,

57:29.184 --> 57:31.796
he's eating mac and cheese
right now not 10 feet away.

57:33.667 --> 57:36.844
Put him on. Okay, one sec.

57:40.544 --> 57:41.544
Dad?

57:45.244 --> 57:46.787
Well hey bucko. You okay?

57:46.811 --> 57:49.659
Yeah no, no worries,
all's good, I'm a,

57:49.683 --> 57:50.747
I'm glad you got home safe.

57:50.771 --> 57:52.836
You don't sound okay.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.296
No worries.

57:55.602 --> 57:56.995
I'll check in on you tomorrow.

57:58.344 --> 57:59.582
Okay. I love you.

57:59.606 --> 58:01.105
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

58:25.676 --> 58:26.676
Stay!

58:39.820 --> 58:40.820
Oh shit!

59:05.846 --> 59:07.128
What do you want?

59:07.152 --> 59:08.632
Please, is your dad here?

59:14.768 --> 59:17.989
Jesus, Louis. I'm real sorry,

59:18.990 --> 59:20.295
to see you like this.

59:21.993 --> 59:24.822
Louis I, I don't even
know where to begin.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.584
So tie one on with me eh?

59:28.608 --> 59:30.717
Louis I don't need a
beer, I need help!

59:30.741 --> 59:32.370
I need you, your phone,
or maybe your truck!

59:32.394 --> 59:35.896
I can't give you any
of those things, I-I,

59:35.920 --> 59:37.898
I can't help you at all.

59:37.922 --> 59:39.987
Why not? Because in order

59:40.011 --> 59:42.666
for me to help you, you would
have had to have left.

59:43.928 --> 59:45.843
Left what? Your house.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.778
You never did.

59:48.802 --> 59:51.476
I never...

59:51.500 --> 59:54.025
You never left, your house!

01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:23.968
Hey!

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.623
Hey!

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:53.084
Simon?

01:00:56.957 --> 01:01:00.633
I, I had to come, something in
your voice, what's going on?

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:01.851
Please.

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:03.747
What? Please just, just stop it!

01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:06.813
Please don't make
me look at her.

01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:08.403
What the hell is going on?

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.625
Look at me!

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:26.594
Fuck you!

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:30.053
Would you like to leave?

01:01:30.077 --> 01:01:32.036
It's impossible, I
get it, I know.

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:34.428
You can.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.191
No obstacles, no
trick, I promise.

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:39.521
I don't believe you. It's true.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.569
You can walk right back
out into the world.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:50.576
Abandon the job, beg
for another loan.

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:53.753
Your family stays
in their hellhole.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.277
You leave.

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:01.761
You leave them again.

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:12.858
Or I could stay.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.600
Yes.

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:19.015
Stay like you stayed?

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.039
Yes.

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.174
And be with you. No.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.876
You must do this
alone, as I did.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.709
And where would you go?

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:39.319
Free.

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.020
I'll stay.

01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:41.165
But I have to finish
the job first.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.719
So you finally call back?

01:04:37.743 --> 01:04:40.548
Sorry, work's been hard,

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.182
I kind of disappeared in it.

01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:46.119
Finn won't stop
asking about you.

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:49.146
He's, been having bad dreams.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.149
Are you okay? Fine.

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:57.086
I saw the house Simon, Finn
had photos on his phone

01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:01.549
and he has to let me into his
phone now, we made a deal, so,

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.682
I saw it. And?

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.014
And, I knew

01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:14.258
exactly what you're up to.

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:17.869
And?

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:26.052
And, it was a real
nice thought Simon.

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:28.228
I love that you thought it.

01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:34.364
Okay.

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:38.847
Look I I'm sorry it's late.

01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:41.153
But...

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.873
Well is Finn up?

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:47.310
Can I... He's asleep.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:48.335
It's after 11.

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:52.881
Oh, is it? Well, you want me

01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:53.905
to wake him?

01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:57.233
Well, if you... Actually,
you know what,

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:59.148
he's been through a lot.

01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:01.174
I-I should probably just...
Let him sleep.

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:04.394
That's the best thing.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.700
I think so.

01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:10.227
Tell him I love him.

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:12.358
I'll tell him.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:15.188
Goodnight Simon. Goodnight Bev.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.060
Love you.

01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:22.152
Okay...

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:54.053
Okay.

01:07:58.335 --> 01:07:59.379
No...

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:22.029
This is so like this
picture I showed him.

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.535
Your painting I know,
I hate that painting.

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.609
That's really weird, I
was just looking at that

01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:38.462
a few weeks ago
after the funeral.

01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:42.354
For some reason I
went looking for it.

01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:44.120
It's ours now, right?

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:47.774
Yeah well, it's ours
for the moment.

01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:52.278
But, we'll sell it
soon, don't worry.

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:54.520
No one expects us to
live in a house where...

01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:57.196
That would just feel...

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.656
I'm scared to go in.

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:02.573
Yeah me too a little.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:07.752
Hey why don't you wait
in here then, okay?

01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:10.339
I'll go gather some
stuff and we can go

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:12.602
back to the motel. No.

01:09:12.626 --> 01:09:13.626
I'm coming in.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:38.522
Oh Simon...

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.540
I keep wondering if he never
even met that doctor.

01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:00.935
Never knew where he...

01:10:15.341 --> 01:10:16.840
He said there was a
better chance of

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.214
being hit by an asteroid.

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:21.955
Yeah.

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:24.131
Well...

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:30.226
They have to hit
somewhere, don't they?

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:33.706
I guess so.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.428
Hey.

01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:51.916
And it's amazing.

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:58.009
It doesn't feel bad in here
like I thought it would.

01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:01.317
No, it doesn't.

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.669
I like how it feels.

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:19.204
Do you miss the city?

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:23.687
Not one dime.

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:46.013
And where would you go?

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:48.407
Free!

01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:49.816
It's the strangest thing.

01:13:52.732 --> 01:13:55.256
I'm getting kind of used to it.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:58.825
Uh-hmm...

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.439
Sleep tight.

01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:12.685
I'll leave my door open.
Goodnight Mom!

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:14.101
Goodnight.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.467
Goodnight Dad.
