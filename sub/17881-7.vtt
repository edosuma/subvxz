00:12.740 --> 00:15.180
Did it explode?

00:15.180 --> 00:17.650
Oh, my God. There's flagella everywhere.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.620
What have we done?

00:23.390 --> 00:26.420
Uh, I took the back stairs.
Are there spiders in my hair?

00:26.420 --> 00:29.790
- I am five seconds away from a total freak out.
- Relax, Ted.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.030
If you had been bitten by
one of the back-stair spiders,

00:32.030 --> 00:34.100
you'd be flopping on the floor,

00:34.100 --> 00:37.030
deep in the throes of spider
madness. Your hair is so perfect.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.600
Man, I want to be you. What? Nothing.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.570
Boom. And all clear.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.610
So did you go the
back way to avoid Ryan,

00:44.610 --> 00:46.780
the chatty security guard?

00:46.780 --> 00:49.680
No. I'm trying to create a
spider sanctuary in my hair,

00:49.680 --> 00:51.750
maybe get some of that
sweet government money

00:51.750 --> 00:53.250
to fund my head.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.750
Sarcasm... the first
sign of spider madness.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.690
Yes, I am trying to avoid Ryan.
Every time I walk by the guy,

00:58.690 --> 01:01.620
he sucks me into a
15-minute conversation.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.890
You do that eight times
a day, it adds up to...

01:03.890 --> 01:06.230
Well, time I could be
working on my math skills.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.730
Ryan was a very friendly guy,

01:08.730 --> 01:10.730
which was exactly the problem.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.200
- Hey, Teddy. Notice anything different about me?
- Nope.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.900
I got a haircut. Want to see a penis?

01:15.910 --> 01:18.410
What? What the hell's wrong with you?

01:18.410 --> 01:20.340
Oh, I see what you thought there.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.340
No, no, you know my wife's preg.

01:22.350 --> 01:26.050
Take a look at this
ultrasound picture of my son.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.880
Sitting at his desk all day,
Ryan had a lot of time...

01:28.890 --> 01:31.220
To think about things,
really stupid things.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.620
Hey, Ted. You went to college.
Who you think would win

01:33.620 --> 01:35.590
in a fight between
Santa Claus and a shark?

01:35.590 --> 01:37.130
Shark.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.190
Wrong. Hey, while I got you here,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.100
how are we ever gonna solve
this middle east thing?

01:45.100 --> 01:47.040
He once sucked me into
a 20-minute conversation

01:47.040 --> 01:49.070
about the colonization of mars.

01:49.070 --> 01:51.840
- Spoiler alert... he's for it.
- I don't want to insult the guy.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.780
If only there were a nice way to say,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.810
"you're killing me, you
energy-sucking time-gobbler."

01:55.810 --> 01:57.980
You're avoiding a difficult situation.

01:57.980 --> 02:00.380
For the first time,
I feel like you and I

02:00.380 --> 02:02.550
may be part of the
same species. Anyway...

02:02.550 --> 02:05.450
Veronica wants us upstairs
to talk about a project.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.120
Shall we slip out the back?

02:09.660 --> 02:12.060
We're not going past the spiders.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.600
- Unless you let us both sit on your shoulders.
- And then run.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.130
- And then we go out the front.
- Fine. We'll go past Ryan.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.070
But no matter what, we keep walking.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.740
If one of us gets caught,
the others don't come back.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.640
Unless it's me. Come back for me.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.880
Hey, hey. It's my three favorite people.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.820
Don't engage. Keep going. Keep going.

02:34.820 --> 02:39.220
- So my mom's back in the hospital.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Ryan. Damn it.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.190
- Leave him.
- Yeah.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.360
They just cannot find
the head of that parasite.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.130
Parasite? Damn it.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.070
A half-hour later, we
were finally upstairs.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.040
I didn't tell Phil and Lem

02:54.040 --> 02:56.740
they were gonna be
working alone with Veronica

02:56.740 --> 02:58.740
because they find her
a little intimidating.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.310
- Have a good meeting.
- What? Where are you going?

03:01.310 --> 03:03.450
I'm not on this one. I have
quarterly budget reports.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.380
- You guys will be fine.
- But... no, stop. Ted?

03:05.380 --> 03:07.280
Ted? Ted? Ted? Ted? Ted? Ted?

03:07.280 --> 03:09.280
This is the first time
the guys are working

03:09.290 --> 03:10.790
with Veronica without me.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.890
It might take a little getting used to.

03:12.890 --> 03:16.760
Ted? Ted? Ted? Ted?

03:18.290 --> 03:20.800
She's staring at us...

03:20.800 --> 03:23.170
with her eyes.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.200
Oh, you guys. You're making me feel bad.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.170
Come on. Get away from the door.

03:28.170 --> 03:29.640
Get away from the door.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.740
What's up, Veronica?

03:33.740 --> 03:37.550
Okay, first of all, you
know you're holding hands?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.280
Oh.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.550
Will that be all?

03:43.550 --> 03:46.090
No. The company finally realized

03:46.090 --> 03:49.090
the P.A. System in this
building needs to be fixed.

03:49.090 --> 03:51.130
It makes everything
sound like that janitor

03:51.130 --> 03:54.030
that got trapped inside the wall.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.060
"Let me out. I'm not a ghost."

03:56.070 --> 03:58.700
We do have a lot of fun here.

04:00.270 --> 04:02.740
The P.A. Has been causing
problems for years.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.710
That's weird.

04:09.710 --> 04:12.080
The bird passed out.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.390
Wake up, you stupid bird.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.360
Luckily the effects were temporary.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.790
After a week of vomiting,

04:25.800 --> 04:28.330
everyone, even the
bird, was back at work.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.430
But from then on, no
one took any chances.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.270
Every time they heard the P.A.,

04:32.270 --> 04:34.770
they ran for the emergency exits.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.340
It's the P.A.!

04:38.340 --> 04:40.680
Run or we'll all die!

04:45.350 --> 04:47.880
The constant evacuations are
costing the company money.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.790
Plus, nobody knew it was fajita day,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.290
and that hurt a lot of
feelings in the cafeteria.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.720
That explains all those
sad people in sombreros,

04:54.720 --> 04:58.460
which is traditionally the
happiest hat in the world.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.930
Well, next to the fez.

04:59.930 --> 05:03.600
I think it goes like this...
sombrero, fez, ten-gallon...

05:03.600 --> 05:06.700
I would like to unsubscribe from
whatever you're doing right now.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.940
You two need to design
a new P.A. system,

05:08.940 --> 05:11.370
one that can actually
transmit human voice.

05:11.370 --> 05:13.040
It needs to be wireless

05:13.040 --> 05:15.710
so executives can broadcast
from anywhere in the building.

05:15.710 --> 05:18.250
I suppose we could use the
20 terahertz oscillator.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.250
But doesn't that burn throu flesh?

05:20.250 --> 05:23.920
- Not always.
- How about we use the 10 terahertz oscillator?

05:23.920 --> 05:26.760
10? Yeah. Why don't we
just hop on a winged unicorn

05:26.760 --> 05:28.460
and fly off to magic land?

05:28.460 --> 05:30.760
Bunsen, beaker, focus.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.730
This thing you do, with the science

05:32.730 --> 05:34.730
and the yammering and the unicorns?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.870
That doesn't work for me.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.200
Well, that's part of our
process to come up with...

05:39.200 --> 05:41.670
sorry, from now on when
you present ideas to me,

05:41.670 --> 05:44.140
only one of you is allowed to talk.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.480
But that's not how we work.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.710
- Exactly. That's now how we work.
- Not.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.510
- Now.
- Not.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.250
Now.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.950
- Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
- Not?

05:54.950 --> 05:57.590
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.290
We should go.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.530
So I'm thinking about asking
security to reassign Ryan.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.530
Does that make me a bad person?

06:07.530 --> 06:10.000
Before you answer
that... I just sponsored

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
a political prisoner
for Amnesty International

06:12.000 --> 06:13.970
and rescued a dog from the freeway.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.400
His name was Sparky. I don't know
the dog's name. He didn't have a tag.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.940
I don't see what your problem is.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.180
Ryan is just a nice guy who
wants to get to know people.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.880
And as my mom says, "getting to know
people is the best way to get to know them.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.780
Is this the same woman who
says, "you eat what you eat"?

06:28.790 --> 06:30.990
Oh. Look, there's Mr. Krebs.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.950
He walks by two or three times a day.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.560
He's dull as toast but
always wants to talk.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.330
Look how I deal with it,
or as my mom would say,

06:38.330 --> 06:42.500
"watch what you watch
and see what you see."

06:42.500 --> 06:44.930
Hi, Linda. How are you today?

06:44.930 --> 06:47.400
I'm great, Mr. Krebs. Hey,
did you ever figure out

06:47.400 --> 06:50.370
- what's making that noise in your car?
- Oh, no. For me, new cars are like women.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.170
They start making noise,

06:52.180 --> 06:55.110
- I don't know what the heck I'm supposed to do.
- But there both fun

06:55.110 --> 06:58.010
- to take out for a spin once in
a while, right? - Uh-oh. Look out.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.850
Nice to talk to you, Mr. Krebs.

07:00.850 --> 07:04.150
See? You should just accept
people for who they are, Ted,

07:04.150 --> 07:05.890
and embrace them.

07:05.890 --> 07:08.020
I can't stand who Phil and Lem are,

07:08.020 --> 07:09.990
- so I'm changing them.
- I can't believe you two.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.030
Ted's annoyed by Ryan. You
don't like how Phil and Lem act.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.760
You both have to be more tolerant.

07:17.130 --> 07:19.230
Which would really help me right now,

07:19.240 --> 07:22.340
- because I'm sure I just crossed a line.
- Maybe Linda's right.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.340
Maybe she did just cross a line.

07:24.340 --> 07:27.080
And she's also right
about your Ryan problem.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.380
Don't be a wuss, Ted.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.710
If someone'sothering you, change them.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.680
- No, I didn't say any of that.
- The version of Linda you heard in your head is right.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.450
I shouldn't be avoiding
this. I should do something.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.720
Good job, Linda. We brought him around.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.920
- Look what we can do when we work together.
- That's not what I...

07:42.930 --> 07:45.430
I heard what you said,
but it bothered me,

07:45.430 --> 07:48.030
so I changed it like you suggested.

07:53.470 --> 07:57.110
Friendship... it's so important.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.840
But it's different at work.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.140
Time spent with friends at work

08:01.140 --> 08:03.650
robs your employer of productivity,

08:03.650 --> 08:06.280
and robbing people is wrong.

Sync by yescool - corrected by chamallow35

08:18.930 --> 08:21.600
Hey, it's Ted. You know
a thing or two about feet.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.480
How thick should a
toenail be? Specifically...

08:24.520 --> 08:25.770
Whoa. We're not doing that.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.770
Uh, listen, Ryan, I...I need
to talk to you about something.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.400
Anything you want, Teddy.
I love our conversations.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.450
Sitting down here gets so boring.

08:33.490 --> 08:36.780
Chatting with you is
the best part of my day.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.120
All right. Show me your damn feet.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.500
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Look...

08:41.500 --> 08:44.960
I need you to dial down
how much you talk to me.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.250
I mean, I like you Ryan.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.250
- It's just, this is a place of business, not a hair salon.
- Really? You think I talk too much?

08:50.250 --> 08:52.210
Well, I don't know about
generally, but to me?

08:52.210 --> 08:55.010
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Wow. That's kinda hard to hear.

08:55.010 --> 08:57.590
Hi, honey. You ready to go to lunch?

08:57.590 --> 08:59.100
I guess so.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.930
Uh, Ted, this is my wife Sarah.

09:01.930 --> 09:05.350
Oh, my God. The Ted? Ryan's
told me so much about you.

09:05.350 --> 09:07.900
You've been such a great friend...

09:07.900 --> 09:10.770
all the talks you've had
about his mom and my pregnancy.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.860
Oh, did you show him your toe, honey?

09:12.860 --> 09:15.780
- Does he know what that thing is?
- Ted's an important man. He doesn't have time for my toe.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.410
Oh, I'm...I'm not that important.

09:18.410 --> 09:20.410
Oh, I'm getting a phone call.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.620
My phone's vibrating. It's on vibrate.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.040
Hello.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.920
Wow, that is a big problem that
requires my immediate attention.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.040
I'll be right up.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.130
Yeah, my phone's broken.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.670
It rings even though it's on vibrate...

09:35.670 --> 09:38.640
And I'm on the phone with you.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.180
It was nice to meet you.

09:46.770 --> 09:49.020
All right, I'm not gonna sit
through another dog and pony show,

09:49.020 --> 09:49.850
so which one of you is
going to speak, dog or pony?
All right, I'm not gonna sit
through another dog and pony show,

09:49.850 --> 09:52.480
so which one of you is
going to speak, dog or pony?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.820
- Well, Phil and I were hoping...
- Pony it is. Go.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.200
Right. So... The P.A. System...

09:57.990 --> 09:59.160
Put your hands down.

09:59.530 --> 10:03.080
We're installing new
speakers on every floor.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.370
Now for an executive
to access the system

10:05.500 --> 10:08.370
from anywhere in the building,
they'll wear two control pins...

10:08.370 --> 10:10.500
one for the mike and one for the volume.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.750
Attached like so...

10:12.920 --> 10:15.340
The pins create the perfect
acoustic triangulation.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.840
You twist this one
to activate the system

10:17.840 --> 10:20.720
and this one to control the volume.

10:22.680 --> 10:26.470
And what if those two little
knobs were attached to a woman?

10:28.100 --> 10:30.560
Do you see how that could be a problem?

10:33.940 --> 10:37.280
Oh!

10:39.490 --> 10:43.410
All right. You face the wall.
You tell me this can be fixed.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.580
Not a problem.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.580
But we'll need more aluminum.

10:50.580 --> 10:51.710
Titanium.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.130
That's it. We're done.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.710
And next time you present,

10:54.710 --> 10:57.420
only one of you is allowed in my office.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.800
- Now face each other.
- Why?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.600
This is not a good look for us.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.810
Maybe it'll look less
weird if I carry you.

11:14.060 --> 11:15.900
Nope.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
So did you hear the
latest office gossip?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.410
Ryan the security guard quit his job

11:22.410 --> 11:24.370
because you're a giant douche-mobile.

11:24.370 --> 11:26.490
That's right, you're a douche on wheels

11:26.490 --> 11:28.040
or perhaps a decorative sculpture

11:28.040 --> 11:29.950
hanging above a baby douche's crib.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.210
- The gossip didn't specify.
- Wait, Ryan quit his job?

11:32.210 --> 11:34.580
He stormed out of here yesterday.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.920
Of course, he stopped to
tell everyone he passed

11:36.920 --> 11:40.010
what was going on, so his
storming took most of the day.

11:40.010 --> 11:42.380
- He was actually the last one out of the building.
- Oh, God. I feel awful.

11:42.380 --> 11:46.010
I... I didn't mean to hurt the guy.
I just wanted to change him a little.

11:46.010 --> 11:48.970
Well, maybe I can change things back.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.940
- I gotta go find him.
- Well, if you want to get there fast...

11:51.940 --> 11:54.400
Yes, I'll take the douche-mobile.

11:55.860 --> 11:59.320
Why do I have to be the one to present
this stupid P.A. system to Veronica?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.940
Because I did the talking last time,

12:00.940 --> 12:02.070
so it's your turn in the saddle, cowboy.

12:02.070 --> 12:03.570
Get on that horse and...

12:03.570 --> 12:05.530
I don't know any more cowboy things.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.870
Wait. Beans.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.620
- But I've never presented to Veronica by myself.
- I know.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.080
Together we're a thing
of beauty, like a swan.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.630
But on my own, I'll be like half a swan.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.210
All I'll do is make a big mess and die.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.340
Gentlemen.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.760
Man we don't know.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.720
Whoever you are, you're not
supposed to be down here.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.720
We have a lot of top-secret stuff

12:25.720 --> 12:27.850
that no one's supposed to see.

12:27.850 --> 12:30.390
- Okay, we'll show you one thing.
- Each.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.430
No, no, I'm not here
to look at anything.

12:32.430 --> 12:34.560
I'm just taking a roundabout
route to avoid someone.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.230
Is it Ryan? He's gone.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.310
Moseyed on outta here.
Another cowboy thing.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.230
I have more than I thought.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.240
- Peg leg.
- No, that's not one.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.700
No, no, no, it's some needy blonde

12:44.700 --> 12:47.620
who talks my ear off every
time I walk by her cubicle.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.490
She's obsessed with my
car and my wife. Who cares?

12:50.490 --> 12:52.580
They're both small, boring and Japanese.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.460
You know what might brighten your day?

12:54.460 --> 12:57.380
A peek at the smallest
squirrel science can make.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.380
But we're going to have to
ask you to wear a face mask.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.880
He's crazy easy to inhale.

13:08.430 --> 13:09.100
Oh, Ted.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.560
What are you doing here?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.520
Did my husband's talking bother
you all the way across town?

13:12.520 --> 13:16.060
Okay, that's fair. Um,
actually I came to apologize,

13:16.060 --> 13:19.020
get him to come back to work,
maybe have a look at that toe.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.480
I don't know the problem,
but I stopped by a pharmacy.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.650
- I bought everything that had a foot on the label.
- Is that Ted?

13:24.650 --> 13:27.780
Let him in, 'cause I got
me things I want to say.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.780
Hey, Ryan.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.040
Shut up. You talk too much, Ted.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.410
How does that feel? 'Cause I don't care.

13:35.410 --> 13:38.290
You're in my house now, and I
can talk about whatever I want,

13:38.290 --> 13:41.880
like my heart and how you broke it.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.420
- I thought we were friends.
- Hey, we are friends.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.420
Why else would I come here

13:46.420 --> 13:49.140
and bring you this bag
of stuff for that... whoa.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.300
Nothing in this bag is gonna hthat.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.890
Look, I know what I said
yesterday was insensitive.

13:55.140 --> 13:57.690
I really want you to come back to work.

13:57.690 --> 14:00.440
And you can talk as much as you want

14:00.440 --> 14:03.020
or 20% less 30%... it's up to you.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.570
40%, 50%, whatever.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.990
It means a lot that you would come here.

14:06.990 --> 14:09.110
Okay, I'll come back.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.030
And I know sometimes I talk too much.

14:11.030 --> 14:13.330
I'm sorry. But don't
give up on me, friend.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.200
Hey, I am not giving up on you.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.960
- My water just broke.
- Well, I should get out of your way.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.460
Oh, God. It's happening. Oh
man. I drank too much to drive.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.420
Ted, can you take us and film the birth

14:23.420 --> 14:26.210
and help us name him and cut the cord?

14:26.210 --> 14:30.010
Yes. Maybe. Benjamin.
And a big no the cord.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.010
You can present to Veronica.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.430
You're brave. You're strong.

14:34.430 --> 14:37.020
Who opened that jelly
jar this morning, huh?

14:37.020 --> 14:39.060
Who kicked that jar's ass?

14:39.060 --> 14:42.400
You did, you rugged son of a bitch.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.820
- So hey.
- Hey.

14:44.820 --> 14:47.360
You're kinda freakin' everyone
out. How you doing in there?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.610
I'm okay. Well, not great. Pretty bad.

14:49.610 --> 14:52.160
I just lied to myself
about opening a jelly jar,

14:52.160 --> 14:54.030
which is worrisome.

14:54.030 --> 14:55.580
You're gonna be fine.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.580
I used to be afraid of Veronica, too,

14:57.580 --> 14:59.000
because she's scary and dangerous,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.580
and rumor has it,

15:00.580 --> 15:03.250
she once walled up a janitor
in her office, but you're...

15:03.250 --> 15:03.840
Hey, why is Mr. Krebs taking
the stairs? He's got a bad leg.
she once walled up a janitor
in her office, but you're...

15:03.840 --> 15:06.130
Hey, why is Mr. Krebs taking
the stairs? He's got a bad leg.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.760
He said he's trying

15:07.760 --> 15:10.050
to avoid some needy
blonde in the cubical area.

15:10.050 --> 15:12.510
So back to me and how
I'm going to be fine.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.720
Wait, was krebs talking about me?

15:14.720 --> 15:17.270
I'm not needy. He's the one who's needy.

15:17.270 --> 15:20.020
Hey, krebs?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.440
I'm not fine yet.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.190
You made me worse, and
I was already so bad.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.820
Are you avoiding me?

15:25.820 --> 15:28.900
- Clearly that's impossible.
- I can't believe you called me needy.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.950
- You're the one who's needy.
- You're the one

15:30.950 --> 15:33.530
who stops me to talk every
time I pass your desk.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.490
I don't make small talk with you.

15:35.490 --> 15:37.450
You make small talk with me

15:37.450 --> 15:39.950
- because it brightens your damn day.
- No, it doesn't.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.670
- Yes, it does.
- It's my day. I think I know.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.920
Hey, look, Buddy. I'm not
the Ryan in this relationship.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.050
You're the Ryan. You talk my ear off,

15:47.050 --> 15:50.050
but I put up with it because I
accept who you are... the Ryan.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.260
You know what? I just
won't be friendly anymore.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.010
Fine. Whatever keeps you quiet.

15:54.010 --> 15:56.510
No, I will be friendly
because that's who I am,

15:56.510 --> 15:58.560
- and I love that about me.
- I don't care.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.480
- I just won't be friendly to you.
- Good!

16:00.480 --> 16:02.560
- You're mean.
- You're tedious.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.690
- You're rude.
- You're bland.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.900
- You're old.
- Are you as turned on as I am right now?

16:07.900 --> 16:11.490
- No. What? Ew! No. What's happening?
- You're not feeling this...

16:11.490 --> 16:13.700
is heat that's finally
happening between us?

16:13.700 --> 16:15.410
No. Barf.

16:15.410 --> 16:16.990
You're a horrible man.

16:16.990 --> 16:18.450
And I'm a friendly person

16:18.450 --> 16:21.500
who never wants to talk to you again.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
Oh. Stop by my desk on your way out.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.790
I made some of those butter
cookies your wife likes.

16:26.790 --> 16:28.880
Oh.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.510
Unfortunately me and
my new best friend Ryan

16:31.510 --> 16:33.420
never made it to the hospital.

16:33.420 --> 16:34.970
That's it. Push, S... Sarah.

16:34.970 --> 16:36.930
Just keep going. There you go.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.970
I don't even let my
daughter eat in this car.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.600
We have combined the P.A. microphone

16:43.600 --> 16:46.480
and the volume knob into
one convenient nipple.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.440
I'm sorry. Nipple.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.030
I'm sorry.

16:51.030 --> 16:53.490
You're just a shivering
chihuahua, aren't you?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.820
Actually, this is going
better than I had expected.

16:55.820 --> 16:59.030
I can't get this pin on.
God, this is frustrating.

16:59.030 --> 17:01.910
Maybe we should have some
juice. That always calms me down.

17:01.910 --> 17:04.040
- Here, you do it.
- Me?

17:04.040 --> 17:06.790
No, the microphone attaching
elf who lives in my drawer.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.329
Talking about drawer elves

17:08.329 --> 17:10.589
isn't going to make this any less Scary.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.550
I'm sorry. My hands are very sweaty.

17:16.550 --> 17:20.599
And I've never been this
close to your neck before,

17:20.599 --> 17:24.180
which is the perfect flesh
pedestal for your head.

17:24.180 --> 17:27.560
God, I'd kill a man for
some juice right now.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.520
And I'd like to unhinge my jaw
and swallow you like a mouse,

17:30.520 --> 17:33.820
but we both have to
work with what we have.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.280
- Come on. Hurry up. Careful. Don't stick me with it.
- I've almost got it.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.530
Aah! I'm bleeding.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.660
Get out! Get out now!

18:03.180 --> 18:04.930
I guess it works.

18:04.930 --> 18:07.600
Yes, it's a huge improvement
over the old system,

18:07.600 --> 18:10.610
which made everybody panic
and run out of the building.

18:10.610 --> 18:12.360
You're so critical.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.530
No wonder I'm afraid
to be alone with you.

18:14.530 --> 18:16.570
I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing,

18:16.570 --> 18:18.490
like, "you're so critical.

18:18.490 --> 18:21.740
No wonder I'm afraid
to be alone with you."

18:21.740 --> 18:24.580
Wait. Am I dreaming?

18:24.580 --> 18:26.080
No, Phil, you're not.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.370
Crap.

18:47.100 --> 18:51.850
I am Veronica, queen of Veridian.

18:51.980 --> 18:55.980
The gorilla habitat will
be closing in 15 minutes.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.950
I need a price check on peas.

18:58.950 --> 19:01.490
And now it's time for
all the young people

19:01.530 --> 19:04.240
to come to the dance floor.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.910
Hello, Ted.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.950
Hello, crazy lady talking
to an empty building.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.410
Where is everybody?

19:09.460 --> 19:12.630
If corporate calls, I'm
going with "it's Saturday."

19:12.630 --> 19:14.590
Well, I've had an eventful day.

19:14.630 --> 19:17.460
Turns out, I should not have
tried to change Ryan, but I did.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.050
Now my car looks like someone
made wine in the backseat.

19:20.090 --> 19:22.090
And trying to change Phil and Lem

19:22.140 --> 19:25.050
was even more irritating
than just leaving them alone.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.140
I scared everyon out of the building

19:27.180 --> 19:29.020
and I got stabbed in the neck.

19:29.060 --> 19:31.060
Although I did get to watch Phil run.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.440
He was like an ostrich in a lab coat

19:33.480 --> 19:34.860
trying to catch a bus.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.280
And I saw the beautiful
miracle of birth...

19:37.320 --> 19:39.190
And the less-beautiful
expulsion of afterbirth.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.200
Maybe my kindergarten teacher was right.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.610
- Maybe I am too controlling.
- Ah, probably.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.830
But I am certainly not
gonna try to change you.

19:45.870 --> 19:48.620
Thank you.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.160
It's lonely always knowing what's best.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.210
I know, right?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.330
Well, we've got each other.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.880
And that reminds me of apecial song

19:58.920 --> 20:01.760
from a simpler time.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.510
* They say our love won't pay the rent ?

20:04.550 --> 20:06.600
Not doing it.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.220
* Before it's earned,
our money's all been spent

20:10.270 --> 20:12.190
Not doing it.
