00:02.794 --> 00:06.131
Did you believe Lieutenant Rodriguez
intended to kill you?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.174
I had no doubt. He stood up,

00:08.258 --> 00:10.010
said it was me and him
alone in that office.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.929
He went for his gun.
Next thing I know, I'm shot in the back.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.639
VALERIE: Did you move towards him
at any time?

00:14.764 --> 00:16.891
No, I never came out from behind my desk.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.395
-Reach for your gun at any time?
-Absolutely not.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.606
It all comes down
to who you want to believe.

00:23.982 --> 00:27.694
A cop who's been the target
of investigations involving corruption,

00:27.861 --> 00:32.198
or a cop who has spent his entire career
protecting our city.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.285
Captain Fraker walked
into Lieutenant Rodriguez's office,

00:35.744 --> 00:41.833
and unprovoked, shot him.
I ask you to find Captain Fraker guilty.

-It was a statement.
-No, it wasn't.

You wanna talk about it.
You're looking to start a conversation.

Let's just stop this now and start over.

01:22.207 --> 01:26.628
Yes, John, there is a dump job
by a shopping cart down by the water.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.214
-Any ID yet?
-I'd have said so.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.509
There's bruises on her neck.
Looks like she's been knocked around.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.385
There's no shoes, no makeup, no purse,

01:34.719 --> 01:38.014
-I don't think she planned on going out.
-Who's the guy in the banana sling?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.324
-Maybe her boyfriend.
-And who's that?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.284
This fat dude named Desmond.

He gets her high
so she'll hang out with him.

And where can we find him?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.627

All right, I'll get Andy and John on that.

-A family member or friend?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.018
I'm not hungry.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.853
I'd rather leave.

I mean, he's chained up,
and he's back a ways, but...

-Couple days ago.

Desmond. Let's go.

I only got a minute. Manager's a twitch.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.188
On the phone earlier,
you said you knew Eve Berlay.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.814
Yeah. We were neighbors in L.A.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.692
-When's the last time you talked to her?
-Few years. She all right?

15:43.776 --> 15:47.237
A few years? She called you last week,
Norma. We got her cell records.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.074
Look, guys, if she's involved
in something, I got nothing to do with it.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.367
Then why are you lying to us?

'Cause I don't go looking to get people
locked up.

for doing that.

The weather, old times?
Norma, we're not leaving.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.218
Just caught up.
It had been a long time. Years.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.637
Well, get specific,
or we'll do this at the station house.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.681
She asked me a lot of questions
about the past.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.057
Did it ever catch up to me?

16:15.182 --> 16:16.976
But it doesn't,
because I never left the business.

16:17.601 --> 16:18.644
What business?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.855
-Dancing, touring, films.
-Porn films?

16:21.939 --> 16:24.608
Yeah, but like I said,
you gotta leave for it to catch up.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.903
-Why was Eve curious about that?
-She did some movies.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.491
She might be a soccer mom now,
but she wasn't in '85.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.785
And since then,
she's been keeping it under wraps?

16:34.868 --> 16:38.080
Ever since she left L.A., except
for the occasional phone call to me.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.832
She completely ditched that life.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.334
But she was calling you now
because it caught up with her?

16:42.584 --> 16:45.796
It sounded like some guy called
wanting to talk about her movies.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.840
I said, "If you deny it,
he's gonna hound you.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.676
"So, just talk to him on the phone.

-"They always disappear."

16:53.721 --> 16:56.306
She called him Tom.
Sounded like she made it up.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.560
And your advice was to make friends
with a potential stalker?

16:59.727 --> 17:01.437

Can I go?

He got dog eyes and a dog brain, okay?

He can't tell the difference
between a cop and some fool

17:44.688 --> 17:45.856
well, that makes me more nervous.

Janelle Woodruff?

17:48.108 --> 17:50.611
-Couple of months.
-Getting her high so she'd put out?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.784
Look, I was helping her out.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.120
And she told me the money
was going for groceries and rent.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.165
And Janelle's ex-husband, what's this
about you two getting in a fight?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.250
DESMOND: Couple of nights ago,
I was over there.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.045
And that lunatic fool
come banging the door down.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.839
Him and Janelle,
they start yelling at each other.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.841
And I step in, trying to keep the peace.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.552
And homeboy hauls off
and cracks me in the jaw.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.932
He started it. Ask Janelle.
Okay, no, don't ask her, she's a liar.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.518
But... but you can ask her son, Michael,
he was there.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.019
He saw the whole thing.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.021
-ANDY: What's her ex's name?
-DESMOND: Craig.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.357

18:29.066 --> 18:31.610
-Sure look it.
-You know where to find this guy?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.362
You haven't talked to him yet?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.448
Hold up. Who put you on to me?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.534
And for what?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.495

last night.

-She's dead.

I'm not sure I understand
what this means.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.638
Is... is Lieutenant Rodriguez
gonna be prosecuted now?

24:33.722 --> 24:35.015
No, the DA won't go after him.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.435
Fraker will sue the department.
Rodriguez, me.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.437
Come on, guys.
Let's not get ahead of this.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.064
Uh, Stella Starr did four adult films

24:43.148 --> 24:46.485
and a couple of what these sickos call
loops. Most of it's out of print,

24:46.735 --> 24:48.653
but there's a few postings
on the auction sites.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.531
Detective McDowell or Ortiz?
Daniel Kawamoto.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.075
The client the DOA's husband says
he was with this morning.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.369
CONNIE: So, we got your message...

24:56.495 --> 24:58.622
I can look into this more if you want.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.208
You scratch the surface,
you find a whole underbelly.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.959
Check the... check the auction sites,

25:03.043 --> 25:05.420
see if anyone's shown a recent interest
in Stella Starr.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.131
Okay. Rita, this Kawamoto says

25:08.215 --> 25:10.175
he wasn't with the DOA's husband
this morning.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.843
He lied to us.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.597
We appreciate it, Mr. Kawamoto.
We'll be in touch.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.687
I have no idea who Stella Starr is.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.856
-Your wife never mentioned the name?
-No.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.816
Did she ever mention
living in Los Angeles?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.610
She lived there just before we met.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.779
Do you know anything about
what she was doing in L.A.?

25:30.904 --> 25:32.989
What she was doing...
she worked in a bookstore.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.699
-How is that important?
-CONNIE: Whether or not she worked

25:34.824 --> 25:38.078
in a bookstore, we understand
she was supplementing her income

25:38.203 --> 25:39.913
using the name Stella Starr.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.083
(CHUCKLES) Will you please stop
and tell me what you're talking about?

25:43.375 --> 25:47.837
Your wife was doing adult films,
Mr. Berlay. Porn.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.257
I don't know who you think you are,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.134
but if you weren't a woman,
I would knock you on your ass.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.512
You weren't aware
she had this in her past?

25:55.720 --> 25:56.846
She worked in a bookstore.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.475
CONNIE: And what we're telling you
is she also did some pornographic films

26:00.642 --> 26:03.520
-under the name Stella Starr.
-That's a lie.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.611
This is fake.
A nine-year-old could do this.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.197
It's not, and I don't think
it's news to you.

26:14.364 --> 26:18.159
-Look, what are you talking about?
-Have a seat, Mr. Berlay.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.541
If you have any knowledge
of how your wife got killed,

26:24.666 --> 26:26.376
tell us now, so we can help you out.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.921
Did you find out about this
and have a confrontation?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.631
-No.
-CONNIE: It's easy

26:31.715 --> 26:32.841
to understand a guy losing it

26:33.091 --> 26:35.010
when something like this pops up
in his marriage,

26:35.093 --> 26:38.930
-but you gotta tell us to get that across.
-Look, I didn't kill my wife.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.725
Then why'd you lie
about where you were this morning?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.268
I was with Martin Sole.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.646
I was showing him strip-mall property
in Queens. I told you that.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.149
No, you said you were
with Daniel Kawamoto.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.153
I was supposed to go with Kawamoto,
but he canceled.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.571
I meant to say Marty Sole.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.823
If this is another lie,
it'll only delay the inevitable.

26:56.906 --> 26:59.075
Look, I wasn't thinking straight
when you asked me this morning.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.412
-I just found out my wife was murdered.
-Are you thinking straight now?

27:02.495 --> 27:06.249
No, I'm not. My wife is dead,
and you're throwing dirt on her memory.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.667
You're calling her a slut.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.671
But even so, I know for a fact
that I was with Marty Sole.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.591
And until you can confirm it
and apologize to me,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.176
I have nothing more to say.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.889
(DOOR OPENING)

27:25.810 --> 27:26.895
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:27.103 --> 27:28.521
-Last night...
-What about it?

27:28.605 --> 27:31.149
Now, so, you been barking
at your flabby girlfriend too long, Craig.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.109
You take that tone with me,
you're the one gets hit.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.819
Good point. Say no more.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.946
We know you were at Janelle's apartment
last night.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.866
You're wrong,
and I'm saying that respectfully.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.618
What was the problem? Hmm?

27:42.035 --> 27:45.163
Janelle didn't want to take you back?
Didn't want to give you no money?

27:45.372 --> 27:47.290
Or were you just pissed off
to see that she was able to live

27:47.374 --> 27:49.542
-fine without you?
-I was there last week.

27:49.959 --> 27:54.089
Janelle and I had ourselves a discussion.
I left. Ain't seen her since.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.758
That shopping cart you used
to wheel her down to the water,

27:56.841 --> 27:58.468
you don't think
we'll pull your prints off that?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.595
The old shopping cart from the hallway?

28:00.845 --> 28:04.432
Yeah, I touched that before.
But not last night, 'cause I wasn't there.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.769
I was at Becky's having me
some big-white-woman sex.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.771
But since it look
like you ain't gonna believe me

28:09.854 --> 28:11.523
no matter what I say,

28:11.606 --> 28:14.109
you leave me no option but to sit here
and withhold my peace,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.861
until which time, you either release me
or charge me with something

28:16.986 --> 28:19.531
I'm confident the judge
will throw out quick-like.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.618
I'm thinking that somebody
just might be sitting

28:23.702 --> 28:27.038
in the other room right now
missing his mom real bad,

28:27.122 --> 28:30.959
and not missing his never-around
murdering scumbag dad.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.670
You can't talk to my son
without my permission.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.756
Why is that, Craig?
You ain't his legal guardian no more.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.343
You had that revoked three years ago
when you beat Janelle's face in,

28:40.427 --> 28:41.428
remember?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.975
So, you just gonna sit back
and let us grind the truth out of your kid

28:47.058 --> 28:49.269
instead of standin' up and protecting him?

28:49.769 --> 28:52.313
‘Cause we go straight from here
to raking him over the coals,

28:52.480 --> 28:55.692
-that's what you want?
-You tell Michael his daddy love him.

29:01.948 --> 29:04.242
-RITA: Yeah, all right, thanks.
-(RECEIVER CLATTERING)

29:04.409 --> 29:07.704
The DOA's husband, his alibi holds.
He was with a client all morning.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.416
Well, I laid it on thickest.
I'll talk to him.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.709
If you're kicking the husband,

29:12.792 --> 29:15.462
I definitely got a guy
worth talking to. Here.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.590
-(PAPER RUSTLING)
-Tom Grybowski, collar for stalking?

29:18.798 --> 29:20.467
That stripper we talked to said the DOA

29:20.550 --> 29:22.093
might have been approached
by a guy named Tom.

29:22.177 --> 29:26.014
Yeah, he's got postings looking to buy
anything Stella Starr-related

29:26.097 --> 29:28.767
at all the auction sites
and porn message boards.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.895
-He's in the city?
-Yeah, First and East Seventh.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.271
All right, thanks.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.440
That was the ME
on Eve Berlay's rape case.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.067
She's positive for sexual assault,
and they got DNA.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.821
For what it's worth, Stella Starr
is what's known as an under-five,

29:41.905 --> 29:45.825
meaning she did under five films,
which makes them very rare.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.702
And in his postings,

29:48.119 --> 29:52.123
Grybowski goes into intricate detail
about her natural C-cup

29:52.248 --> 29:55.251
-and her perfect bust-to-waist ratio.
-CONNIE: Well, we'll talk to him.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.630
I'm gonna deal with Mr. Berlay.
I'll meet you downstairs.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.886
-Where's the kid?
-Coffee room.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.639
-What? The dad wouldn't talk?
-No, he talked,

30:07.722 --> 30:09.808
not about killing his ex-wife,
which we know he did.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.101
-Where you at with his son?
-I just checked on him.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.521
Said he gave us everything he knows,
and he wants out of here.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.607
All right, let's get him to pokey.
We'll try talking to him.

30:17.690 --> 30:18.983
Uh, kid's pretty shut-down.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.194
(SIGHS) Maybe he needs to see
a fresh face.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.529
It might shut him down even more.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.532
-I'll see that doesn't happen.
-BALDWIN: Hey, Andy?

30:25.824 --> 30:28.117
I say just give him some time.
Let him come around.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.328
And I say put him in the pokey.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.248
Why are we doing this little tango here?

30:33.414 --> 30:36.000
Because he's a young kid.
His mom just got killed.

30:36.292 --> 30:40.004
And he knows something about it,
or he wouldn't have lied to us all day.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.048
GREG: Boss.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.927
-Where are we at on the cases?
-Connie and Rita are grabbing up a guy.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.679
We're working Craig Woodruff.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.765
When I get settled,
I'll call you in for a full update.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.017
-Boss, we're just...
-I'm fine.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.895
Everything's all right.
We got cases to work. Get on it.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.065
-(DOOR CLOSING)
-So, what did we decide here?

30:59.357 --> 31:00.775
We didn't decide anything.

31:01.067 --> 31:04.237
Sounds like you're gonna do
what you want to do. So, do it.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.714
JOHN JR.: (CLEARING THROAT) Hi, Michael.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.924
I'm Detective Clark.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.927
We're very sorry
about what happened to your mother.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.181
Now, we've also been investigating
your mom's murder.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.434
And the problem we got right now
is that...

31:35.101 --> 31:36.394
my partner and I have found stuff out

31:36.561 --> 31:38.771
that's different than what you're telling
the other detectives.

31:39.355 --> 31:42.191
-I ain't been lying.
-Let's just start fresh, okay?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.444
Whatever you said before,
don't worry about it.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.947
We're not gonna hold anything against you.
We got witnesses who say your dad

31:48.031 --> 31:50.408
was at you and your mom's apartment
last night.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.118
JOHN JR.: Now, I see you're putting
all this effort

31:52.201 --> 31:54.829
into trying to keep your story straight.
Just relax.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.956
Let it go. And tell us what happened.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.627
Okay, so, he was there last night.
Don't mean he killed her.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.670
Now, did your dad ask you to lie about it?

32:02.795 --> 32:05.632
No. I just knew you cops
would try to lay this on him

32:05.715 --> 32:07.008
if I told you he was there.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.803
We also got witnesses heard yelling
coming from your apartment last night.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.390
People are saying it sounded
like your mom and dad were arguing.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.770
Where's the other guy, Detective Jones?
He's who I been talking to.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.105
Were your parents arguing last night,
Michael?

32:21.481 --> 32:22.815
I don't know nothing about that.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.109
Oh, we think you do.
In fact, we're pretty sure you do.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.071
Michael, did your dad threaten you
if you said anything?

32:28.279 --> 32:29.364
Nope.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.952
-Did you like your mom?
-Hell, yeah, I did.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.162
Maybe you shouldn't ask
that question again.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.705
ANDY: Then why aren't you sticking up
for her, hmm?

32:38.039 --> 32:41.209
She stuck up for you all these years
a lot more than your dad did.

32:44.545 --> 32:47.548
(SIGHS) You know how we found her?

32:48.549 --> 32:50.718
And I'm sorry, but you need to hear this.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.888
Stuffed in a shopping cart,
her face all bloodied,

32:53.972 --> 32:56.933
-left there for the sea gulls.
-Okay, that's enough.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.601
I don't want to hear no more.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.396
You're trying to protect the guy
who took your mom away from you.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.273
-He's my dad.
-He hasn't been there your whole life.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.110
And I don't care what he promised
to try to keep you quiet,

33:07.276 --> 33:09.696
he ain't gonna be there
for you now either.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.408
He's my dad.

33:15.868 --> 33:16.869
All right.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.080
All right.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.541
(SHUTTER CLOSING)

33:21.749 --> 33:23.584
I have said it now three times.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.212
This morning,
I was home alone in my apartment.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.464
Now, please tell me,
what am I doing here?

33:28.548 --> 33:30.341
(SIGHS) You sure you don't know,
Mr. Grybowski?

33:30.425 --> 33:32.135
I didn't hurt anyone.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.637
Who said anything
about hurting someone?

33:34.721 --> 33:38.808
You said the name Stella Starr,
which I've never heard before.

33:38.891 --> 33:43.479
Then you're asking me where I've been.
So, obviously, she must have been... hurt.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.941
-You know, this is ridiculous.
-Mr. Grybowski,

33:47.358 --> 33:51.988
a friend of Stella Starr's, or Eve Berlay,
told us she agreed to meet you.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.406
That friend gave us your name.

33:53.489 --> 33:55.950
Now, we understand your reluctance
to be honest,

33:56.034 --> 33:57.493
seeing how you've been busted before

33:57.577 --> 33:59.954
for stalking your coworker,
but give us the truth.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.832
You and Eve met. She signed some photos.

34:02.915 --> 34:07.128
You shook hands, and parted ways.
Or we got no choice but to arrest you.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.881
We met at the Washington Square diner.
No big deal.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.132
You hunted her down on the Internet?

34:11.215 --> 34:14.302
-"Hunted her down." I did a Google search.
-(CONNIE LAUGHING)

34:14.552 --> 34:16.220
And she just agreed to see you.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.014
Fifteen years keeping a secret,

34:18.097 --> 34:20.558
-but you're a big fan, so, why not?
-Yeah, pretty much.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.895
'Cause Eve's friend will testify
that you threatened to tell her husband

34:23.978 --> 34:26.981
-if she didn't meet you.
-All I said to her was, "You've got fans,

34:27.065 --> 34:29.817
"people who appreciate your work.
You can't shut us out."

34:29.984 --> 34:31.861
So, she met me, signed some photos.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.238
-We were friends.
-Were friends.

34:35.281 --> 34:38.284
Are. You... you're twisting
everything around.

34:38.367 --> 34:42.747
This is a case that breaks our hearts,
‘cause Eve would still be alive

34:42.830 --> 34:44.832
if she just didn't listen
to some really stupid advice,

34:44.916 --> 34:46.876
which was to indulge
your jerk-off fantasy.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.377
-Hey!
-This is someone

34:48.544 --> 34:51.047
who got her life together,
and you had to destroy it

34:51.255 --> 34:54.050
'cause you just can't get laid
in the real world.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.594
-Up yours, lady.
-You threatened her.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.930
And you were the last person
she met before she died.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.389
That's enough to get your DNA,

35:00.473 --> 35:02.642
which will match up
to what you left on her dead body.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.561
CONNIE: And since we're past
you denying it, here's your choices.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.313
Say you had feelings
for this Stella Starr,

35:07.396 --> 35:08.856
maybe... maybe you loved her.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.733
And when she wouldn't accept
your advances,

35:10.817 --> 35:13.569
you lost it, that's ten years.
Or keep lying,

35:13.653 --> 35:16.030
and we'll say
you're an obsessive porn-freak asshole

35:16.114 --> 35:19.367
who destroyed a happy family
for no good reason, 25 years.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.245
Stand up and turn around.
You're under arrest.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.748
She slapped me. She attacked me in my car.
I had to save myself.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.375
Why did she attack you?

35:27.458 --> 35:29.335
She was talking like a doctor,
how I need help,

35:29.460 --> 35:30.461
and it's not right that I call her.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.046
-And then...
-You choked her.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.756
She never attacked you. That was a lie.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.092
When you think you know somebody,
and that you're communicating,

35:36.175 --> 35:39.303
-and then she just wants to break it off.
-Break off what?

35:39.512 --> 35:41.347
You didn't have a relationship with her.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.432
She met with you
'cause she was scared you'd ruin her life.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.143
I just wanted to be in her life,

35:45.226 --> 35:47.270
but she treated me like a psycho
with his dick in his hand.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.106
And that earned you the right
to rape her and kill her?

35:50.773 --> 35:53.109
What was so wrong about saying
that I had love for her?

35:53.192 --> 35:55.319
-That I thought we could be friends?
-Tom...

35:56.445 --> 35:59.490
did you rape and strangle Eve Berlay
this morning?

35:59.615 --> 36:02.160
That's what we need to know,
so we can start to help you.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.626
I guess, I did. Yes.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.172
But I didn't rape her.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.049
She was dead before we had sex.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.647
-ANDY: Here's where we're at, Craig.
-Yeah.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.357
We just got Michael something to eat,

36:33.441 --> 36:35.484
give him a chance to calm down,
stop crying.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.195
-CRAIG: Okay.
-He's already given us

36:37.278 --> 36:38.529
that you were at the apartment last night.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.781
He also gave us
that you and Janelle argued.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.784
-Don't know why he'd say that.
-I do. You killed his mom.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.621
-Wrong, flat-out.
-(SIGHS)

36:47.830 --> 36:50.875
-You fish at all, Craig?
-Once or twice.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.461
The hook is in. Michael's going.

36:53.669 --> 36:57.215
I just come down here
'cause I'm a father to a young boy myself.

36:57.423 --> 37:01.219
And I would not want him to experience
what I'm about to put your son through.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.012
This is your last chance.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.556
You stand up for your son, or I break him.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.183
Listen...

37:11.020 --> 37:12.355
I got no beef with you.

37:12.897 --> 37:17.068
And I know you're doing your job,
but will you try and understand something?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.820
-And I'm talking man-to-man here.
-Sure.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.073
I'm not addressing
what happened last night with Janelle

37:22.156 --> 37:23.783
'cause I wasn't there, and I don't know.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.495
But this whole thing...
it's a family matter.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.705
You killing your wife,
that's a family matter?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.083
Uh, uh, uh,
I ain't said nothing about that.

37:32.166 --> 37:35.586
'Cause once again, I wasn't there,
and I don't know.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.881
I'm just informing you
this is a family matter.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.425
Well, that's why they got
manslaughter statutes.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.470
If this is something that came out
of a family dispute,

37:44.553 --> 37:47.765
-we can work with that.
-It's gonna stay a family matter.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.810
And my boy,
he ain't gonna give you nothing.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.687
Fishhook or no fishhook.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.275
I will guarantee you one thing, Craig.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.696
I'm gonna put this case together,
no matter what.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.031
Can I go?

38:05.866 --> 38:07.910
Yeah... for now.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.718
-(DOOR KNOCKING)
-ANDY: Boss?

38:24.927 --> 38:26.679
Woodruff didn't go, so I had to kick him.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.307
-All right.
-Where's Michael?

38:29.724 --> 38:32.268
Uh, Jones is trying to get him placed
somewhere decent.

38:32.685 --> 38:36.105
If we're gonna clear this,
that kid's gonna have to flip on his dad.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.232
Yeah, uh, stay on top of it.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.821
Lieu, you can't let this verdict
weigh on you.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.533
It's another jury-screwing.
It's got nothing to do with the truth

38:47.616 --> 38:49.618
or how anyone around here
or anywhere else

38:49.702 --> 38:52.246
-feels about what happened.
-I know. I'm fine.

38:59.837 --> 39:03.549
I know you're all concerned about me,
and, um, I appreciate it.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.635
But just understand,
all this has been is a disappointment.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.930
I'm not worried about repercussions
or what anyone thinks.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.350
More than anything,
I'm just glad it's over.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.769
Good. Then it's put to bed.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.520
Right.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.608
So, goodnight, everyone.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.568
See you all tomorrow.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.321
-We'll start fresh.
-Night, boss.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.365
Goodnight.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.868
Hey! You sure you're all right?

39:31.494 --> 39:33.454
Positive. Thanks, though.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.760
All right. (SIGHS)

39:47.843 --> 39:50.429
My contact over at child services
is gonna call me back.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.139
I'll be fine on my own.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.933
-I keep telling you that.
-Doing what?

39:54.308 --> 39:58.354
-Selling bottles of water in the park?
-I'll work it out. I always have.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.941
Michael, this lady over at child services
is a friend of mine.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.692
I can get her to cut
through all the red tape

40:03.776 --> 40:05.611
and get you into a good foster home.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.279
Wouldn't you rather have that

40:07.363 --> 40:09.490
instead of spending the night
in the emergency center?

40:10.282 --> 40:13.244
-You don't need to do favors for me.
-Well, that's a yes-or-no question.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.872
Don't you want a nice place
to stay with good people?

40:17.373 --> 40:18.916
(SIGHS) I guess so.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.293
But the thing is, you gotta hold up
your end of the bargain.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.629
You gotta act right, or you'll get tossed.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.756
But I know you can do it.

40:26.799 --> 40:30.261
I got faith in you. Otherwise,
I wouldn't be calling in this favor.

40:30.678 --> 40:31.762
Yeah, okay.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.515
You're at a critical time in your life,
Michael.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.308
There's two ways you can go.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.311
Now, if you want to move forward
towards good things, I can help you.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.897
I'm not just talking about tonight.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.025
-What's the catch?
-There's no catch.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.781
-I'm not gonna rat out my dad.
-I'm not asking you to.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.659
And what's in it for you?

40:54.076 --> 40:56.745
When I was your age, I was in a bad spot.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.707
And somebody helped me out.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.752
Do you want my help?

41:05.671 --> 41:07.423
-Yeah.
-Okay.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.638
You know, it's all right to feel sad
about your mom.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.265
I'm all right.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.683
I'm just saying.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.395
Nobody here knows you,
and I'm not gonna judge you.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.689
So, if you want to talk about it, you can.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.401
(SNIFFLES) I'm just thinking, like...

41:29.361 --> 41:30.779
you know, how hard it's gonna be...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.741
waking up tomorrow and...

41:34.658 --> 41:36.452
(CHUCKLES) ...her not being around.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.787
I know.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.624
I'm sorry.
