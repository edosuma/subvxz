WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:03.094
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:03.095 --> 00:05.376
$1.7 million in sequential bills.

00:05.377 --> 00:08.579
Linda, you know we can't.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.181
Not even just 100 grand?

00:10.182 --> 00:12.343
Not even 100 grand.

00:12.344 --> 00:14.345
We've been building quite a RICO case...

00:14.346 --> 00:15.946
the Turners, Rankos, Millers...

00:15.947 --> 00:19.910
You want me to betray my own people?

00:19.911 --> 00:22.913
Fonso wanted me to tell you
he's thinking about you.

00:22.914 --> 00:24.452
He's sleeping on my couch.

00:24.477 --> 00:26.197
It's going on a week, Charlie.

00:26.198 --> 00:28.279
I would like him out of my house.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.881
Look at those assholes.

00:29.882 --> 00:31.483
I'm gonna take 'em all down.

00:33.606 --> 00:36.167
How...?

00:36.168 --> 00:37.248
Shit!

00:39.852 --> 00:41.172
Charlie?

00:41.173 --> 00:42.854
What do you think that means, Charlie?

00:42.855 --> 00:45.416
The wedding job didn't
satisfy my debt to you.

00:45.417 --> 00:46.818
Not even close.

00:47.406 --> 00:49.020
That's two strikes, Charlie.

00:49.021 --> 00:50.982
This is a good deal. It's a winwin.

00:50.983 --> 00:53.625
You want me to go legit?
If you want to

00:53.626 --> 00:57.428
call realestate developers "legit,"
then, yeah.

00:57.429 --> 00:59.190
LaLa.

00:59.191 --> 01:00.391
Kick some ass.

01:00.392 --> 01:01.553
JunBi!

01:01.554 --> 01:03.915
LaLa. Daddy.

01:03.916 --> 01:05.355
Your father has been banished.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.118
And he's not even family.

01:07.119 --> 01:08.720
Aah!

01:08.721 --> 01:10.401
You want vengeance?

01:10.402 --> 01:12.485
There's more than one kind, Fonso.

01:14.126 --> 01:17.449
You like it? I got it for you.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.724
Hey.

01:52.725 --> 01:54.646
Hey, you okay?

02:04.657 --> 02:07.138
I don't know what's wrong with me.

02:07.945 --> 02:10.663
Nothing, as far as I can see.

02:13.105 --> 02:17.709
A good person doesn't do
the things that I do...

02:18.372 --> 02:21.112
feel the way I feel every day.

02:21.959 --> 02:24.753
Well,
that's just proof you're a good person.

02:25.629 --> 02:29.961
Bad people don't feel bad
about being bad.

02:30.592 --> 02:32.203
Trust me.

02:33.011 --> 02:35.927
I keep making the same mistakes...

02:36.682 --> 02:38.600
over and over again.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.645
You think I'm a mistake?

02:43.105 --> 02:45.216
I'm married.

02:45.217 --> 02:47.150
You're unhappy.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.403
I make you happy.

02:50.988 --> 02:53.105
Tell me I'm wrong.

02:55.187 --> 02:58.470
If it feels right, if it feels good,

02:59.329 --> 03:01.593
that means you need it.

03:02.124 --> 03:04.035
And there's no shame

03:04.036 --> 03:07.959
about needing something or somebody.

03:35.948 --> 03:37.949
I've missed you.

08:24.076 --> 08:26.237
What the fuck?

08:37.667 --> 08:39.250
Morning. Morning.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.422
Thank you.

08:51.389 --> 08:52.544
What?

08:52.932 --> 08:55.107
Was that a test?
Should I have not taken this?

08:58.146 --> 08:59.471
That.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.272
Yes, that.

09:01.273 --> 09:02.554
What is it,

09:02.555 --> 09:04.275
and why the hell was it in your car?

09:04.276 --> 09:06.838
Well, remember I was doing
the pickups the other day,

09:06.839 --> 09:08.520
and I almost got into an accident?

09:08.521 --> 09:11.322
Yeah, I remember.
You thought you hit something.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.565
Right.

09:14.746 --> 09:16.328
You had a vision.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.091
It wasn't real.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.092
Right.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.713
The doll is real.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.139
When I got out of the car,
that was just lying in the road.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.901
Maybe somebody dropped it.

09:30.762 --> 09:32.183
Why is it here?

09:32.681 --> 09:34.906
Maybe I was supposed to stop for it.

09:36.388 --> 09:37.989
Couch is lumpy.

09:37.990 --> 09:40.833
It smells of cantaloupe.

09:43.858 --> 09:45.598
I'm taking your bed tonight.

09:49.572 --> 09:51.523
You two are into some kinky shit.

09:53.846 --> 09:55.847
A few more days, I promise you,

09:55.848 --> 09:57.168
he'll be out of here.

09:57.169 --> 09:58.369
I don't care what you have to do.

09:58.370 --> 09:59.851
Get rid of him.

09:59.852 --> 10:01.734
Your little doll, too.
It's fucking creepy.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.019
Aunt Sylvia wake up yet?

10:08.020 --> 10:09.541
I think she left, bud.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.942
She what?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.824
She didn't say anything?
She just... fucking left?

10:12.825 --> 10:14.385
That's what she does, Nick.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.027
Why do you care?

10:16.028 --> 10:17.669
Nothing.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.436
I don't know.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.834
Okay, so, that's a thing.

10:22.835 --> 10:25.036
I'll talk to him. He's got school.

10:25.037 --> 10:26.638
I'll take him.

10:26.639 --> 10:28.159
No, you can't.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.121
You have a client.

10:30.989 --> 10:32.805
A referral, called in yesterday.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.211
I better dress.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.738
Fuck!

10:46.739 --> 10:48.860
Fuck! Fuck!

10:48.861 --> 10:50.662
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

10:50.663 --> 10:52.263
Fuck!

10:55.347 --> 10:56.973
What did she do?

11:00.112 --> 11:02.033
Mom, I'm sorry.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.595
Sorry you got caught,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.517
or sorry that your aunt
took off with the money?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.238
Fucking Sylvia.

11:07.239 --> 11:09.521
It was my idea. Yeah.

11:09.522 --> 11:11.963
Real rosy picture she painted, I'm sure.

11:12.655 --> 11:14.206
Fun life, easy money.

11:16.168 --> 11:17.969
She tell you about Reno?

11:18.328 --> 11:19.651
Casino security caught her

11:19.652 --> 11:21.773
pulling that little
shortchange bit that she loves.

11:21.774 --> 11:24.936
They broke her fingers, Nick. All five.

11:25.627 --> 11:27.859
Bet she left that out
during your skip day, I bet.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.701
She tell you what happened
at Santa Anita?

11:29.702 --> 11:31.783
Or how she sucked off
a prosecutor in Denver

11:31.784 --> 11:33.184
to get him to try to drop charges?

11:33.185 --> 11:34.506
Mom. Yeah.

11:34.507 --> 11:36.067
She left out all the good stuff.

11:36.638 --> 11:38.911
Here's the trick she didn't teach you,
honey.

11:41.142 --> 11:43.354
Never let anyone hold the money.

11:44.062 --> 11:45.436
The ones you think you can trust

11:45.437 --> 11:47.359
are the ones who fuck you the most.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.765
Get dressed.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.848
You're late for school.

12:26.238 --> 12:29.120
Damn. It's worse than I thought.

12:30.191 --> 12:32.564
I left Angel Love, President Wendy,

12:32.565 --> 12:34.526
and Lady Rhinestone.

12:34.527 --> 12:36.281
Are they okay?

12:38.771 --> 12:40.892
Tell them to give us a moment.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.534
Of course, Mrs. Marks.

12:42.535 --> 12:44.215
Ask them about my dolls.

12:44.216 --> 12:46.249
I'll ask them, sweetie.

12:47.259 --> 12:48.980
Grandma, do they know what happened?

12:49.752 --> 12:52.423
The fire department
called me on the phone.

12:53.047 --> 12:55.547
They told me it was arson.

12:55.548 --> 12:57.749
What's arson?

12:57.750 --> 12:59.991
When someone did this on purpose.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.233
But who would do that?

13:02.682 --> 13:07.038
Your father did a very bad thing.

13:07.039 --> 13:08.920
You think Dad did this?

13:08.921 --> 13:13.164
This is an act of vengeance
against the Council,

13:13.902 --> 13:18.281
against the Ranko family, against me.

13:19.657 --> 13:21.412
I can't believe Dad did this.

13:21.413 --> 13:24.736
Your father seldom
thinks before he acts.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.938
There is a lesson here to be learned.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.620
Yep.

13:28.621 --> 13:30.982
What the fuck else, right?

13:33.171 --> 13:34.065
Sorry.

13:34.066 --> 13:35.627
Hey, you didn't forget, did you?

13:35.628 --> 13:38.790
No. Today's the rakija.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.191
Yeah, I'm headed there now,

13:40.192 --> 13:43.595
and I would...
like Drina to come with me.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.277
I have school.

13:46.401 --> 13:47.561
What is she saying?

13:47.562 --> 13:49.283
I have school.

13:49.284 --> 13:51.125
You can skip school.

13:51.126 --> 13:52.767
Drina, she's right.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.090
We are family now. Go.

14:03.298 --> 14:05.339
What a waste.

14:16.031 --> 14:17.792
You know the ritual, yes?

14:17.793 --> 14:19.393
When a loved one dies,

14:19.394 --> 14:20.955
we bring them their favorite things

14:20.956 --> 14:23.437
so they don't long for anything
in the afterlife.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.560
We brought my mom sunflowers
every day for a year.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.283
Nice.

14:30.853 --> 14:35.289
Tony's tastes were a little more...
elementary.

14:35.290 --> 14:39.254
The rakija is to satiate his thirst.

14:43.018 --> 14:44.242
Here.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.340
Go ahead.

14:46.341 --> 14:47.942
You're a Ranko now.

14:47.943 --> 14:49.383
This is alcohol.

14:49.384 --> 14:51.586
Yes, his favorite.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.268
Alcohol causes dehydration.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.590
This would only make him more thirsty.

14:55.591 --> 14:57.952
Just pour the damn thing, Drina.

15:13.088 --> 15:14.969
You'd better get in the car.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.452
Okay? Go. I'll handle this.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.736
Hi, darling.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.142
Of all the places to show your face.

15:28.704 --> 15:31.065
It was the only place I knew you'd be.

15:32.427 --> 15:34.468
Didn't think Drina would come, though.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.193
She's a good Roma wife.

15:44.052 --> 15:45.600
He treated you like shit.

15:45.601 --> 15:47.683
He didn't deserve to die for it.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.766
Why did you come here?

15:51.767 --> 15:53.608
You know I can't be seen with you.

15:53.609 --> 15:54.609
I know.

15:56.314 --> 15:58.373
Just wanted...

16:00.656 --> 16:03.057
I wanted... you to know

16:03.058 --> 16:04.113
that I'm...

16:06.866 --> 16:10.064
not proud of the things I did.

16:11.287 --> 16:12.506
Proud?

16:12.872 --> 16:17.351
And which...
which things are we talking about?

16:17.352 --> 16:20.354
I know I fucked up, okay? But he's...

16:20.355 --> 16:22.476
If you say that he started it,

16:22.477 --> 16:24.479
I will fucking kill you myself!

16:30.848 --> 16:32.728
I like this look on you.

16:34.529 --> 16:35.978
Yeah?

16:37.772 --> 16:41.255
Do you like not seeing your kids?

16:41.609 --> 16:44.338
Because that's where
the things you did got us.

16:44.339 --> 16:47.261
My sons are without a father.
So are your girls.

16:47.262 --> 16:50.946
And everything...
all of this is your doing.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.509
I love you.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.440
What does that matter now?

17:08.443 --> 17:10.606
We can never see each other again.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.252
Good morning.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.374
I'm Charlie. Come on in.

17:21.777 --> 17:23.978
How did you hear about us?
A friend.

17:24.193 --> 17:27.340
This is your home?
It is. This way.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.306
Interesting energy.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.412
Have a seat.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.194
So,
we offer a number of different services.

17:40.195 --> 17:43.117
Tarot and palm readings, of course.

17:43.118 --> 17:45.199
But the only tea leaves
you'll find around here

17:45.200 --> 17:46.681
are the ones we drink.

17:48.363 --> 17:51.485
And what makes one method
more valid than another?

17:51.486 --> 17:53.447
Nothing, really.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.329
The cards are a little easier
to clean up.

17:59.499 --> 18:00.695
Why do I get the feeling

18:00.696 --> 18:02.658
I'm dealing with a colleague,
not a client?

18:04.339 --> 18:06.420
I'm not a fortuneteller.

18:06.421 --> 18:07.902
I don't have the gift of sight,

18:07.903 --> 18:10.665
but I am curious about what you see.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.306
Well, if you're here to test me,

18:12.307 --> 18:14.710
we can end this right now
because I'm not interested.

18:18.039 --> 18:19.707
Today...

18:20.435 --> 18:22.758
I am strictly a paying customer.

18:37.642 --> 18:39.333
Money is not an issue for you.

18:39.334 --> 18:41.616
You're content in your career
and your love life.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.699
That's not to say that you don't
have doubts about both,

18:44.700 --> 18:46.541
but neither of them
bring you here today.

18:48.584 --> 18:50.304
You're right.

18:50.305 --> 18:52.306
Did this friend who recommended me...

18:52.823 --> 18:54.508
Does she wear a white coat?

18:55.409 --> 18:56.992
Only in the office.

18:58.553 --> 19:00.074
Well, I'm sorry I'm the one

19:00.075 --> 19:02.678
to have to tell you you've been misled.

19:04.199 --> 19:07.521
If you see the good doctor,
please tell her I'm just fine.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.523
I don't need her help or yours.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.217
That is not why I'm here.

19:12.510 --> 19:16.612
We share something... special.

19:18.333 --> 19:22.897
She thought that maybe you and I
could learn from each other.

19:23.312 --> 19:25.259
You see things, too?

19:25.564 --> 19:27.902
I hear things.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.905
Messages.

19:31.946 --> 19:33.267
From the other side?

19:33.268 --> 19:34.709
From everywhere.

19:34.949 --> 19:36.912
From the universe.

19:38.714 --> 19:40.354
You...

19:41.837 --> 19:43.998
All of it, or just a particular galaxy?

19:43.999 --> 19:46.480
Nora said that you'd be resistant.

19:46.481 --> 19:48.362
I'm sorry. I'm just not sure

19:48.363 --> 19:50.124
what I can learn from a guy

19:50.125 --> 19:53.127
who looks like he sleeps
in a tent on the beach

19:53.128 --> 19:54.889
and sings "Kumbaya."

19:54.890 --> 19:57.291
Let me guess... Malibu.

19:57.292 --> 19:59.053
A little further inland.

19:59.054 --> 20:01.295
And you hear the universe
speaking to you.

20:01.296 --> 20:04.378
It speaks to every one of us.

20:04.379 --> 20:07.702
Dr. White thought that perhaps you and I

20:07.703 --> 20:10.985
could help each other
become better listeners.

20:12.153 --> 20:13.828
What was your name, again?

20:13.829 --> 20:14.864
Paz.

20:16.324 --> 20:18.192
It means "peace."

20:18.193 --> 20:20.154
Of course it does.

20:21.370 --> 20:23.157
Well, I'm afraid to tell you

20:23.158 --> 20:26.761
that this is a big waste of your time.

20:26.762 --> 20:29.403
My hearing is just fine.

20:29.404 --> 20:31.926
No knowledge gained is ever a waste.

20:31.927 --> 20:33.969
Then just my time.

20:47.382 --> 20:49.625
I'll be seeing you, Charlie.

20:54.990 --> 20:58.473
Shouldn't you be hearing me, Paz?

21:08.804 --> 21:10.205
Shit.

21:11.847 --> 21:14.089
I am in the wrong business.

21:17.258 --> 21:19.037
You see where these two branches meet?

21:19.038 --> 21:21.215
This one here is called a sucker.

21:21.216 --> 21:24.458
Trim it flush with the limb.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.342
You want to make sure the plant
is at least a foot tall.

21:28.938 --> 21:30.666
Or it might not recover from the shock.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.268
Sounds like you want me to do it?

21:35.069 --> 21:36.791
Women your age enjoy gardening.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.633
It reduces stress.

21:38.634 --> 21:40.154
Does it?

21:40.282 --> 21:43.357
You, in particular, find it relaxing,

21:43.358 --> 21:46.841
which is why you come here every week,

21:46.842 --> 21:50.244
on this day, at this time.

21:50.626 --> 21:52.167
You're never late.

21:55.250 --> 21:59.573
Women my age enjoy sex and whiskey.

22:02.012 --> 22:03.577
Where did you learn this?

22:03.578 --> 22:07.022
It's not a hobby for a young man.

22:09.224 --> 22:11.025
My mother taught me.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.508
I'm so sorry.

22:14.509 --> 22:17.431
When did she die? Six years ago.

22:17.432 --> 22:19.234
We're not here to talk about my mother.

22:22.533 --> 22:24.799
There was a kris last week,

22:24.800 --> 22:29.283
and Josip ordered a restructure
after White Tony's death.

22:29.284 --> 22:32.486
And your son was banished,
his income and assets stripped.

22:32.487 --> 22:35.730
I know. I guess you do know.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.451
I'm also aware of the fire

22:37.452 --> 22:40.094
that ravaged the home
he recently vacated...

22:40.095 --> 22:42.216
your home. AA terrible accident.

22:42.217 --> 22:44.979
We think one of the girls
forgot the curling iron on.

22:46.056 --> 22:49.319
Make a clean cut... right there.

22:54.509 --> 22:56.151
Oops!

22:58.834 --> 23:00.796
Sex and whiskey.

23:08.123 --> 23:10.284
I know right now
you think you can play me.

23:10.285 --> 23:11.846
One foot in, one foot out,

23:11.847 --> 23:14.769
but that game doesn't end well for you.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.651
The D. A.'s office can reopen

23:16.652 --> 23:18.693
the investigation
into Anthony Ranko's death

23:18.694 --> 23:20.655
just as quickly as they closed it.

23:20.656 --> 23:23.979
And neither of us wants that... do we?

23:35.064 --> 23:36.751
So, this is your closing statement.

23:36.752 --> 23:39.674
It reflects the purchase price,
funds you've deposited,

23:39.675 --> 23:41.636
and costs for various services.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.518
So we're gonna need you
to sign and date the bottom.

23:44.519 --> 23:46.080
Thank you.

23:46.081 --> 23:47.321
And we'll need this notarized.

23:51.046 --> 23:52.807
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:52.808 --> 23:55.489
Thought we were gonna
keep this professional.

23:55.490 --> 23:57.212
What do you think I'm doing?

23:59.574 --> 24:01.496
Yeah.

24:04.219 --> 24:05.660
It's a little unusual

24:05.661 --> 24:07.061
for a buyer to be their own notary.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.425
Exceptions can be made.

24:12.547 --> 24:13.829
Of course.

24:15.430 --> 24:17.031
Okay.

24:18.148 --> 24:21.195
We're gonna need our thumbprints
on the record book.

24:21.986 --> 24:25.239
Here... and here.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.762
Okay.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.771
Last thing...

24:36.772 --> 24:39.934
this confirms your intent to pay
all applicable closing costs.

24:39.935 --> 24:42.376
The funds will be transferred wirelessly

24:42.377 --> 24:47.101
from your account at the Bank...
of Oaxaca.

24:52.788 --> 24:54.669
And your half?

24:54.670 --> 24:56.871
Cash.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.474
I'll, have it for you tonight.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.235
Thanks.

25:04.439 --> 25:08.002
Congratulations.
You're now property owners.

25:08.003 --> 25:09.804
If you have any questions,
just give my office a call.

25:09.805 --> 25:12.087
I appreciate you coming
all the way over here.

25:13.408 --> 25:14.890
Yeah.

25:17.372 --> 25:19.614
Who'd have thought?

25:19.615 --> 25:21.656
The two of us in business together?

25:25.180 --> 25:27.461
Let's go make it official.

25:39.595 --> 25:42.717
This is a new beginning
for the both of us.

25:42.718 --> 25:45.479
A chance to rebrand ourselves.

25:46.074 --> 25:47.722
We're fucking moguls now.

25:47.723 --> 25:50.685
Come on, cheer up, man.

25:50.686 --> 25:52.366
You look like someone killed your dog.

25:52.367 --> 25:56.170
We own all of this,
including this fucking dojo.

25:56.171 --> 25:58.453
Now your kids have to see you.

26:01.256 --> 26:03.297
Yeah. Suppose you're right.

26:03.298 --> 26:04.922
Damn right, I'm right.

26:08.223 --> 26:09.944
No better revenge than success.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.465
That's the spirit.

26:11.466 --> 26:14.189
Now, just imagine
what we can do with this place.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.560
Shit.

26:48.904 --> 26:50.385
The fuck.

27:02.357 --> 27:04.879
You don't mind, do you?

27:21.915 --> 27:23.938
So, my office will be in touch with you

27:23.939 --> 27:25.019
when the test results come in.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.460
Okay. Thanks.

27:27.129 --> 27:28.743
Dr. White.

27:28.744 --> 27:31.065
Linda. I haven't heard from him.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.587
You didn't call him?

27:32.588 --> 27:34.068
The session ended hours ago.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.190
Well, I appreciate that,
but I have patients.

27:36.191 --> 27:37.872
I take it you haven't heard from him,
either.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.714
He's not exactly one to open up.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.598
I didn't want to, to push him.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.841
You trust this guy, though... Riz?

27:46.842 --> 27:48.282
Paz. Pazhani Kapoor.

27:48.283 --> 27:50.845
Yes. I have known him for years,
actually.

27:50.846 --> 27:52.446
Um, honestly, if he can't get a read

27:52.447 --> 27:53.928
on what's happening with Charlie,

27:53.929 --> 27:56.530
I... I'm out of ideas.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.653
"What's Happening With Charlie."

27:58.654 --> 28:00.294
It sounds like a bad TV movie.

28:00.295 --> 28:02.016
Am I the dutiful wife

28:02.017 --> 28:03.497
who helps him beat the fucking odds?

28:03.498 --> 28:05.620
How are you doing in all of this?

28:05.621 --> 28:07.101
I'm good.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.585
I'm not sleeping much,
but it's not a big deal.

28:10.586 --> 28:12.747
Well,
that's not really my area of expertise,

28:12.748 --> 28:14.228
but I can point you to someone.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.870
No, thanks.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.594
Linda, why don't we talk
about this with me in my office?

28:21.266 --> 28:23.038
Let me know if your friend calls.

28:40.656 --> 28:42.898
Well, well.

28:47.382 --> 28:49.223
I came to give these back to her,

28:49.224 --> 28:50.865
then I saw this. I should have known

28:50.866 --> 28:53.027
the smart money would be on both of you.

28:53.757 --> 28:56.190
Dr. White sent him, not me.

28:56.844 --> 28:58.993
Guess I don't need to ask how this went.

28:58.994 --> 29:00.764
I thought we were past this.

29:01.236 --> 29:03.517
She ran every test,
and they all came back the same.

29:03.518 --> 29:05.600
Because what's going on
with you isn't medical.

29:05.601 --> 29:07.842
So you send a witch doctor to my house?

29:07.843 --> 29:09.483
Like, I'm not mad. I get it.

29:09.484 --> 29:11.806
I know why you came to see her.
I know you're concerned.

29:11.807 --> 29:13.567
Do I see things that are not there?

29:13.568 --> 29:16.851
Yes. But I'm not afraid of them, Linda.

29:16.852 --> 29:19.013
Then why rescue a fucking doll?

29:19.014 --> 29:20.494
They tell you to?

29:21.618 --> 29:23.257
Look, I'm just trying to help.

29:23.258 --> 29:24.663
I know that.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.223
Then why aren't you
telling me everything?

29:30.145 --> 29:32.306
There's more to all of this.

29:32.796 --> 29:34.148
You're not letting me in.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.870
I won't let you in?

29:35.871 --> 29:37.953
I'm not the one sleeping
in the car all night.

29:40.636 --> 29:43.599
No. You're not.

29:46.059 --> 29:47.201
Where are you going?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.084
Your turn to pick Nick up from school.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.212
Try not to hit anything.

30:32.287 --> 30:34.449
Hey. Hi, honey.

30:36.812 --> 30:38.773
You're not supposed to be here.

30:38.774 --> 30:41.135
Actually, it's you who's trespassing.

30:41.136 --> 30:43.778
I own the place.
What do you mean, you own it?

30:43.779 --> 30:46.901
I bought it...
the entire fucking mall, actually.

30:46.902 --> 30:48.944
Sorry for swearing, baby.

30:53.710 --> 30:55.509
LaLa, get back in the car.

30:55.510 --> 30:58.232
I have practice.
You know the rules.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.755
If you want to wait for her,
you do it outside.

31:00.756 --> 31:04.239
Or we can call the police
and have you removed.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.964
LaLa, let's go.

31:29.162 --> 31:30.345
You okay?

32:10.001 --> 32:11.265
No, no, no, no, no.

32:11.266 --> 32:12.827
WWhat's... What's happening here?

32:12.828 --> 32:14.749
What are you doing?
You ain't her.

32:14.750 --> 32:18.112
No, II'm, I'm a friend.

32:18.113 --> 32:20.554
What... What's the problem?
What's the problem?

32:21.048 --> 32:23.678
She pulled some
fucking voodoo shit on me!

32:27.082 --> 32:28.597
What are you talking about?

32:30.223 --> 32:38.223
That's one, two, three,
four thousand, plus five hundred.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.415
It was weeks before I realized

32:41.818 --> 32:44.739
the money never made it to my account.

32:45.238 --> 32:47.662
$4,500, you said?

32:47.663 --> 32:49.463
Sure.

32:49.910 --> 32:57.910
That's one, two, three,
four thousand, plus five hundred.

33:02.758 --> 33:05.920
If I ever see that bitch again...

33:05.921 --> 33:07.962
Come on, man. Please.

33:07.963 --> 33:11.726
Hey, lady, no rent, no apartment.

33:11.727 --> 33:13.648
That's how it works.

33:13.975 --> 33:15.650
How much?

33:16.436 --> 33:19.053
First and last. $4,500.

33:19.054 --> 33:21.736
Plus extra $500 for my trouble.

33:22.359 --> 33:25.299
I'm... I'm gonna need a few days.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.583
You have three hours.

33:50.846 --> 33:52.526
Is Charlie around?
I don't have an appointment.

33:52.527 --> 33:54.128
No. No walkins today.

33:54.129 --> 33:56.090
But the sign's on. Thought I could...

33:56.091 --> 33:57.852
I promise it'll only take...

33:59.615 --> 34:01.295
Maybe you can give me his number?

34:01.296 --> 34:02.817
II can give him a call?

34:02.818 --> 34:04.418
See, my project was greenlit,
which is great,

34:04.419 --> 34:05.900
but now my boyfriend
wants to get back together,

34:05.901 --> 34:07.621
and Charlie says he's
only into me for my...

34:18.754 --> 34:20.234
Shit.

34:44.379 --> 34:47.222
Shit. Shit.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.093
Fuck!

35:25.781 --> 35:27.862
Hi. Hey, what's up?

35:27.863 --> 35:30.905
Did you pick up Nick?
No, I'm on my way now.

35:30.906 --> 35:33.067
The shop in Hollywood had a breakin.

35:33.068 --> 35:34.909
Is everyone okay?

35:34.910 --> 35:37.712
Yeah, it's just some kids
pulling a prank or something.

35:37.713 --> 35:39.834
Hey, listen, I was thinking.
You want me to grab dinner?

35:39.835 --> 35:43.317
Or, I could make something.
Let's just do takeout.

35:43.318 --> 35:46.520
What about Xing Dynasty?
They take forever.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.171
I know, but I love that place.

35:50.173 --> 35:51.646
Chinese it is.

35:54.489 --> 35:58.973
Hey, listen, honey,
I just forgot to tell you,

35:58.974 --> 36:01.535
something I should have said
at the hospital.

36:01.536 --> 36:02.977
I love you,

36:02.978 --> 36:05.660
and I know that you're
just trying to help.

36:05.661 --> 36:07.902
And it means a lot to me
that you care this much.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.777
That's nice to hear.

36:11.306 --> 36:13.428
I'll see you in a bit. Okay.

37:19.014 --> 37:21.896
Fucking fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?

37:34.277 --> 37:36.350
I need 5 grand.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.433
Of my money.

37:41.436 --> 37:42.957
What for?

37:43.828 --> 37:46.001
It's what it costs to
keep her apartment.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.044
Gina's?

37:50.627 --> 37:52.366
So, that thing with her?

37:52.367 --> 37:54.008
It was a real thing.

37:54.009 --> 37:55.632
None of your business.

37:57.425 --> 38:00.054
Fucking comes out of nowhere,
doesn't it?

38:00.970 --> 38:04.098
It goes good, it goes bad,
goes every which way.

38:04.641 --> 38:06.261
And then it goes away.

38:09.504 --> 38:10.897
Your wife...

38:12.547 --> 38:15.150
Three years next month.

38:34.003 --> 38:37.492
It never goes away.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.782
Stand back.

39:17.532 --> 39:20.454
Take what you need.

39:32.227 --> 39:33.521
That's all of it.

39:34.109 --> 39:37.833
First and last,
and another $500 for your trouble.

39:41.156 --> 39:43.238
Pleasure doing business with you.

40:12.107 --> 40:14.187
You know...

40:15.438 --> 40:17.912
you should've seen the bodyguard's face,

40:18.483 --> 40:19.674
Wish I could be there

40:19.675 --> 40:21.676
when she tells Ma
I own the whole fucking place.

40:21.677 --> 40:23.477
Well, they'll...

40:23.478 --> 40:25.918
they'll probably start taking
LaLa to a different dojo, right?

40:29.285 --> 40:31.365
I hope you can spend
some of that new money

40:31.366 --> 40:32.928
on repairing my pool.

40:37.293 --> 40:39.895
Yeah.

40:42.590 --> 40:44.378
Sorry about that.

40:46.301 --> 40:48.763
Got a little desperate..

40:49.504 --> 40:50.723
You know what?

40:51.386 --> 40:54.548
Here's 50 bucks.

40:54.549 --> 40:56.510
Go crazy. Buy yourself a new one.

41:01.957 --> 41:05.880
You know,
for people who don't want me here,

41:06.531 --> 41:08.963
you're sure making me feel at home.

41:09.492 --> 41:11.726
Everyone deserves a last meal.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.689
At least, that's what the courts say.

41:19.615 --> 41:21.617
Give me a second.

41:23.018 --> 41:24.538
Hello?

41:24.539 --> 41:26.100
Hey, sorry to bother you at home.

41:26.101 --> 41:28.462
I thought doctors were supposed
to rebuke mystical shit,

41:28.463 --> 41:30.544
not pawn it off on their patients.

41:30.545 --> 41:33.227
But I'm not calling
to convince you of anything.

41:33.975 --> 41:36.190
I guess you're not calling to apologize,
either.

41:36.853 --> 41:38.552
Your wife came to me.

41:38.553 --> 41:40.675
And even though
I'm no longer your physician,

41:40.676 --> 41:43.638
I felt a duty to, you know,
offer my assistance.

41:43.639 --> 41:46.160
She's actually why I'm calling.

41:46.779 --> 41:47.802
Linda?

41:47.803 --> 41:50.805
I'm not a therapist,
but I did my psych rotation,

41:50.830 --> 41:53.247
and I've been around
enough people in distress

41:53.248 --> 41:55.049
to see the signs, to know them,

41:55.050 --> 41:57.371
and II just... I'm worried about her.

41:57.372 --> 41:58.916
I think you should be, too.

41:59.454 --> 42:01.015
What signs?

42:01.016 --> 42:02.617
Well, I'm sure I don't have to tell you

42:02.618 --> 42:04.899
that she's not sleeping
and she's also agitated

42:04.900 --> 42:07.622
and quick to anger. Okay.

42:07.623 --> 42:09.864
Look, you can tell me to fuck off.

42:10.595 --> 42:14.228
I'm just saying that I recognize
something that concerns me.

42:14.641 --> 42:16.310
First, it was me who needed help,

42:16.311 --> 42:17.992
and now it's my wife?

42:17.993 --> 42:19.513
Which is it, doc?

42:19.514 --> 42:21.636
It's not just you
that your visions affect.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.078
Your behavior affects
everyone around you.

42:24.079 --> 42:25.652
Your family most of all.

42:26.842 --> 42:28.804
Has it affected you?

42:30.205 --> 42:31.366
Come on.

42:32.127 --> 42:34.208
Bye. Come on.

42:34.209 --> 42:35.850
We're running late.

42:35.851 --> 42:37.653
You're driving.

42:47.548 --> 42:49.223
Para el alma.

42:49.801 --> 42:52.707
To the most handsome commercial
realestate developers

42:52.708 --> 42:54.308
in the Valley

42:54.309 --> 42:55.870
and the cabron psychic
who put it together.

42:55.871 --> 42:57.752
Salud.

42:57.753 --> 42:59.474
Salud. Salud.

43:04.199 --> 43:06.280
Okay!

43:06.281 --> 43:08.083
I'm happy for you guys.

43:10.365 --> 43:12.526
I'm gonna go home.
Okay, Charlie. Come on, now.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.770
You're as,
much a part of this as we are.

43:15.771 --> 43:18.212
And if it wasn't for you,
none of this would be possible.

43:18.213 --> 43:20.214
Exactly.

43:20.215 --> 43:22.576
In fact, we have a gift for you...

43:22.917 --> 43:25.339
token of our appreciation.

43:25.340 --> 43:27.502
More of an investment opportunity.

43:35.596 --> 43:36.711
So, what do you think?

43:36.712 --> 43:38.432
What do I think about what?

43:38.433 --> 43:39.809
Your new shop.

43:40.601 --> 43:42.076
Sure, it needs a little work,

43:42.077 --> 43:44.879
but no doubt, you'll have it
up and running in no time.

43:46.361 --> 43:51.005
Fonso, I work for Simza,
for White T Incorporated.

43:51.006 --> 43:54.209
I can't open up a new shop,
especially with you.

43:55.891 --> 43:58.172
If you want to work out a
fucking timeshare with Simza,

43:58.173 --> 43:59.573
that's your business.

43:59.574 --> 44:01.135
This isn't their territory.

44:01.136 --> 44:02.817
They don't have a say.

44:02.818 --> 44:04.378
Now, it seems to me,

44:04.379 --> 44:06.020
you could do with the extra cash,

44:06.021 --> 44:09.864
given that some of your finances
were recently liquidated.

44:11.747 --> 44:14.109
Come on, Charlie. You in or what?

44:36.451 --> 44:38.133
JunBi!

44:39.534 --> 44:42.576
No. No. No.

44:42.577 --> 44:44.058
No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this.

44:50.786 --> 44:53.027
JunBi! JunBi!

45:04.159 --> 45:07.763
What is it, Charlie? What do you see?

45:10.045 --> 45:12.247
JunBi!

45:20.785 --> 45:23.297
Something I can never unsee.

45:23.298 --> 45:25.499
What the fuck does that mean?

45:29.544 --> 45:33.547
If I do this... this is my shop.

45:34.215 --> 45:38.072
I pay rent, and you don't get a cut.

45:39.303 --> 45:41.115
I don't work for you.

45:41.973 --> 45:43.638
I work with you.

45:43.639 --> 45:45.559
We are partners.

45:55.570 --> 45:57.652
Convinced me.
