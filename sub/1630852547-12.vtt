WEBVTT

00:02.152 --> 00:04.319
-All right, one more from us.
-Oh.

00:04.413 --> 00:05.229
(chuckles)

00:05.247 --> 00:07.564
Oh, wow, Max, look.

00:07.566 --> 00:08.915
Another plant.

00:09.084 --> 00:11.585
Yeah, I might've gotten a little
carried away at the nursery.

00:11.737 --> 00:12.994
Nurseries, plural,

00:13.163 --> 00:14.254
and a few unattended gardens.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.998
Okay, let me introduce you
to the gang.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.000
Um, that's Leaf Garrett,

00:19.020 --> 00:22.913
Alexander Hamil-stem
and Jane Fern-da.

00:23.507 --> 00:25.673
And that's
Venus and Serena Flytrap.

00:25.768 --> 00:27.768
And the fact that
neither of them are flytraps

00:27.920 --> 00:29.028
does not bother me one bit.

00:29.179 --> 00:30.937
-It bothers her a lot.
-It really does.

00:31.014 --> 00:32.422
(chuckles)
Well, thank you, both.

00:32.516 --> 00:35.259
I brought muffins,
but I didn't name 'em.

00:35.427 --> 00:37.594
Makes 'em too hard to eat.
(chuckles)

00:37.687 --> 00:41.040
I still regret
what I did to Gerald.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.877
Katharine, come help me
open the wine I brought.

00:45.028 --> 00:46.270
Isn't it a screw top?

00:46.363 --> 00:49.173
Yes, and you have those
big, grippy hands.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.367
Didn't see
your housewarming gift.

00:52.444 --> 00:55.054
Was the six hours
of helping you move not enough?

00:55.281 --> 00:57.056
You ate our pizza,
drank our beer

00:57.283 --> 00:59.283
and then suddenly
had a "back spasm."

00:59.376 --> 01:02.135
Okay, yeah, I'll swing by later
with a candle.

01:02.288 --> 01:03.211
Oh, and nothing patchouli.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.396
I do not want it smelling

01:04.565 --> 01:06.231
like somebody named "Moonbeam"
lives here.

01:06.383 --> 01:08.067
Oh, and if
we're making requests,

01:08.294 --> 01:10.794
I prefer a reed diffuser.

01:10.813 --> 01:13.297
Katharine, is there any chance
you and Oscar

01:13.465 --> 01:16.133
can pull yourselves away from
your puzzle Friday night?

01:16.226 --> 01:17.484
Uh, don't just assume

01:17.636 --> 01:19.319
that's what we're doing
on a Friday night.

01:19.471 --> 01:22.139
I'm sorry.
Uh, what were you going to do?

01:22.157 --> 01:24.583
A puzzle.

01:24.734 --> 01:25.918
But it's a 2,000-piecer,

01:26.087 --> 01:28.161
-so it really kicks the night
into high gear.
-Oh.

01:28.314 --> 01:30.664
I'm sure it does, sweetie.

01:30.816 --> 01:34.668
I met a man at the supermarket,
and he asked me out.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.220
What?

01:36.931 --> 01:38.079
Wow. (chuckles)

01:38.099 --> 01:39.990
"Pickup on aisle three."
(chuckles)

01:40.008 --> 01:41.433
-Stop it.
-No.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.936
I'm really proud of you
for getting back out there,

01:44.087 --> 01:45.512
but what does this have to do
with me?

01:45.606 --> 01:49.090
I was hoping you and Oscar
could join us.

01:49.184 --> 01:50.609
Like a double date.

01:50.719 --> 01:53.186
Why do you want me to come
on a first date with you?

01:53.355 --> 01:54.446
I met him at the supermarket.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.506
I don't know
anything about him.

01:56.525 --> 02:01.453
He could be a homicidal maniac
or really into jazz.

02:02.105 --> 02:03.697
Fine, we'll come.

02:03.773 --> 02:05.365
Ah, wonderful. Oh.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.127
Please send photos
of what you're planning to wear

02:08.354 --> 02:11.547
by Thursday noon,
so I have time to give notes.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.782
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:14.802 --> 02:17.027
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:17.045 --> 02:19.529
(chuckles)
And there she was,

02:19.623 --> 02:20.955
this beautiful redhead

02:20.975 --> 02:24.217
picking up every single apple
in the produce aisle.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.052
And what'd you end up buying?

02:26.147 --> 02:27.813
-A pineapple.
-(laughs)

02:27.964 --> 02:30.298
I asked her out
right then and there.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.152
I like a woman who keeps me
on my toes.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.762
Fun fact, uh, did you know
that the pineapple

02:35.823 --> 02:37.305
is a symbol of hospitality?

02:37.399 --> 02:39.675
Which is why there are carved
representations of them

02:39.677 --> 02:40.734
in many hotels.

02:40.886 --> 02:41.994
That is a fun fact.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.830
Oh. No one ever thinks
my facts are fun.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.331
I like him.

02:47.226 --> 02:48.558
So, what do you do, Charles?

02:48.577 --> 02:50.836
I own a chain
of local fast food restaurants

02:51.063 --> 02:51.986
called Sergeant McCluck's.

02:52.047 --> 02:55.232
I love Sergeant McCluck's.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.509
But why is the Chicky-Chick
Sauce seasonal?

02:57.736 --> 03:00.921
I think we can all agree that
every season is sauce season.

03:01.073 --> 03:02.239
KAT:
Um, Oscar,

03:02.332 --> 03:03.998
I don't think Charles
wants to spend

03:04.018 --> 03:05.833
the whole evening
talking about work.

03:05.928 --> 03:07.001
(chuckles)

03:07.021 --> 03:08.245
Although I would appreciate it

03:08.338 --> 03:09.521
if you could expand
the vegetarian menu.

03:09.673 --> 03:12.191
A large bowl of coleslaw
does not a salad make.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.934
-That's enough, you two.
-It's fine.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.861
It's always nice
to meet a McCluckhead.

03:16.012 --> 03:17.696
BOTH:
Cluck, cluck.

03:17.923 --> 03:19.773
You know, we're thinking
about expanding to New York.

03:19.849 --> 03:21.849
Oh, I love New York.

03:21.944 --> 03:23.276
I lived there one summer.

03:23.429 --> 03:26.930
It was just me, my cousin
and a young Annie Leibovitz.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.114
Isn't that something?

03:28.267 --> 03:30.209
(laughs):
It's something, all right.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.451
A lie.

03:31.603 --> 03:34.104
Where did you meet
Annie Leibovitz?

03:34.197 --> 03:36.957
I met her during
a women's rights protest.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.866
For or against?

03:38.961 --> 03:40.868
For, of course.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.870
We burned our bras together.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.281
CHARLES:
You are just amazing.

03:44.374 --> 03:48.134
I bet your bra burned brightest
of them all.

03:48.287 --> 03:51.288
I'm not gonna lie,
Charles, it did.

03:51.306 --> 03:52.213
(laughs)

03:52.233 --> 03:54.066
(whispers):
What is happening?

03:54.217 --> 03:55.383
(whispers):
I'm on it.

03:56.295 --> 03:57.461
Hey, Chuck,
now that we're friends,

03:57.554 --> 03:59.053
will you tell me
the secret ingredient

03:59.073 --> 04:00.072
in the Chicky-Chick Sauce?

04:00.299 --> 04:02.315
No can do.
(tongue clicks)

04:02.468 --> 04:05.369
Is it grilled onions? Wink twice
if it's grilled onions.

04:07.155 --> 04:08.972
Mm. Isn't this nice?

04:08.991 --> 04:12.158
-And now we don't have to watch
movies on your tiny-ass screen.
-Mm-hmm.

04:12.311 --> 04:14.644
I told you, if you sit closer,
it feels bigger.

04:14.663 --> 04:17.238
-Yeah, you tell me that a lot.
-Hey-- Easy with that.

04:17.316 --> 04:19.073
-People might not know
you joking.
-(laughs)

04:19.093 --> 04:20.550
(chuckles)

04:21.336 --> 04:23.244
Why is this in the couch?

04:23.338 --> 04:25.338
Oh, that's Max's
back-scratching spoon.

04:25.491 --> 04:28.416
-Oh, cool.
-Oh, and sometimes butt.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.601
Dude!

04:29.770 --> 04:32.253
Yeah, your boy has no respect
for common areas.

04:32.422 --> 04:35.256
Like, why does he have to keep
every cabinet and drawer open?

04:35.350 --> 04:36.516
Does he think the dishes
need to breathe?

04:36.668 --> 04:38.335
Is the silverware
afraid of the dark?

04:38.428 --> 04:40.612
Listen, okay, Max is my buddy.
I don't want...

04:40.764 --> 04:43.507
And don't even get me started
on his phone voice.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.767
Yeah, I want light sauce
on one half,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.435
heavy sauce on the other half.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.030
Heavy cheese on the light half
and light cheese

04:50.182 --> 04:51.773
-on the heavy half.
-Uh, Max?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.850
I'm trying to get some work
done. Can you keep it down?

04:54.019 --> 04:55.127
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:55.354 --> 04:57.203
No, no, no, no, no!
Okay, let me start over.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.539
I want light sauce
on one half...

04:59.691 --> 05:01.800
At this point,
I think the whole complex

05:02.027 --> 05:04.194
knows his pizza order,
his credit card number

05:04.287 --> 05:05.971
and that his mom
thinks her coworker Sharon

05:06.122 --> 05:07.139
is sleeping with the boss.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.865
To be fair,
that part's interesting.

05:08.884 --> 05:12.477
I'll give you that. Max cannot
modulate his voice sometimes.

05:12.704 --> 05:14.313
-I mean, have you heard him
try to whisper?
-No.

05:14.464 --> 05:16.389
-That's 'cause he can't.
-(laughs)

05:16.558 --> 05:19.376
Aww, thank you, it's so nice
to know that you have my back.

05:19.394 --> 05:21.302
-Always.
-(bagpipe playing)

05:21.396 --> 05:23.213
What in the hell is that?

05:23.231 --> 05:25.398
Oh, did I forget
to mention the bagpipes?

05:25.551 --> 05:26.900
Come on,
let's go watch the movie

05:27.069 --> 05:28.401
on my laptop in my bathroom.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.387
If we put a towel
at the bottom of the door,

05:30.389 --> 05:32.497
it'll muffle the high notes.

05:32.724 --> 05:34.666
Good God!

05:41.416 --> 05:44.384
-Hey, Carter.
-Can you come out here?
We need to talk.

05:46.421 --> 05:48.347
And can you shut up
the bagpipes?

05:48.574 --> 05:50.515
It's like a thousand
dying goats.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.909
I got another
kid's birthday gig.

05:52.928 --> 05:54.911
(Scottish accent): Have you ever
seen the movie<i> Brave?</i>

05:54.930 --> 05:56.262
(Scottish accent):
No.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.522
(regular accent):
Me, neither, but apparently,

05:57.749 --> 05:59.173
the princess in it is Scottish.

05:59.267 --> 06:01.193
I lied and said
I could play the bagpipes.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.528
I thought, "I'm musical,
how hard could it be?"

06:03.680 --> 06:05.422
Turns out, very.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.682
(regular accent):
That explains the kilt.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.275
No, actually, it doesn't.

06:09.428 --> 06:10.685
Oh, I'm just getting
into character.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.497
(accent): And I like
to let my wee lads breathe.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.448
Can you keep it down,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.434
'cause you are
driving Randi nuts.

06:17.452 --> 06:18.710
(regular accent):
Oh, I'm driving her nuts?

06:18.937 --> 06:20.045
<i> HOST (over device):</i>
<i> Welcome back to</i>

06:20.196 --> 06:23.940
Murder, Murder, Murder.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.384
<i> Last we left off,</i>

06:25.611 --> 06:28.962
<i> the killer was disemboweling</i>
<i> the young housewife</i>

06:29.038 --> 06:30.780
<i> with dull kitchen shears.</i>

06:30.799 --> 06:35.135
<i> She pulled out her victim's</i>
<i> slippery, stringy intestines</i>

06:35.287 --> 06:37.637
<i> and methodically piled them</i>
<i> on the floor,</i>

06:37.714 --> 06:42.383
<i> placing her no-longer</i>
<i> beating heart on top.</i>

06:42.477 --> 06:46.238
Oh, yeah.
This gonna be a good one.

06:46.389 --> 06:48.298
Plus, she eats all my junk food.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.724
How am I supposed
to eat my feelings

06:49.818 --> 06:51.392
with Randi's kale chips?

06:51.470 --> 06:53.303
All right, man, look, I don't
want to get in the middle of...

06:53.321 --> 06:55.730
And she leaves her painty-brush
water in coffee cups

06:55.824 --> 06:56.915
all over the place.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.083
I accidentally drank it.

06:58.234 --> 06:59.643
It really didn't taste good.

06:59.736 --> 07:02.921
Why wouldn't you look inside
the cup before you drink it?

07:03.072 --> 07:05.649
'Cause it was my mug. It said
"World's Greatest Bartender."

07:05.667 --> 07:07.834
Is Randi the world's
greatest bartender?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.669
Are you?

07:09.821 --> 07:11.171
This is on Randi, not me.

07:11.323 --> 07:12.505
Okay, look, I will admit,
I mean,

07:12.658 --> 07:14.674
Randi's true crime
podcasts make me nervous.

07:14.826 --> 07:17.343
I mean, at one point,
I swear she was taking notes.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.329
Exactly.
She's the problem, not me.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.772
(shushes)
Randi will hear you.

07:20.999 --> 07:21.998
It's fine, I'm whispering.

07:22.091 --> 07:24.693
No. You're not.

07:26.763 --> 07:28.171
This has been great.

07:28.264 --> 07:29.355
You know, not many daughters

07:29.508 --> 07:31.174
would go with their mother
on a first date.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.266
Y'all must be close.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.011
Mm. She's the Ethel to my Lucy.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.270
Well, if anyone's Lucy, it's me.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.698
-I'm the redhead.
-Ow, okay.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.275
If you'll excuse me,
nature calls.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.520
Actually, she called
20 minutes ago,

07:43.613 --> 07:46.372
but I've been having
so much fun, I put her on hold.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.041
-(laughter)
-I'll go with you.

07:48.193 --> 07:49.359
I have a few questions
about your mascot.

07:49.377 --> 07:50.952
Why does Sergeant McCluck
wear an eyepatch?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.545
Was he wounded in the war?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.097
-If so, which war?
-Uh...

07:55.291 --> 07:58.218
I was nervous,
but he seems nice, right?

07:58.312 --> 08:00.645
Yeah, and-and he seems
to really like you,

08:00.797 --> 08:04.374
so I don't know why you feel
the need to lie to impress him.

08:04.392 --> 08:06.209
What are you talking about?

08:06.228 --> 08:08.320
Well, all those stories
from before,

08:08.471 --> 08:11.047
like, New York,
A-Annie Leibovitz?

08:11.140 --> 08:12.657
All those things are true.

08:12.809 --> 08:15.309
You tried out to be
a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.145
Yes. Just because you don't
have hand-eye coordination

08:18.165 --> 08:19.480
doesn't mean I don't.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.001
How has none of this
ever come up before?

08:23.152 --> 08:25.670
Well, we usually talk about you.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.247
Which is fine.

08:27.399 --> 08:30.383
It comes with the territory
of being a mom.

08:32.404 --> 08:34.829
Sergeant McCluck doesn't
actually need an eyepatch.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.239
He just wears one to look cool.

08:36.258 --> 08:39.559
I know. I'm disappointed, too.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.192
How was the double date
with your mom?

08:47.343 --> 08:49.194
Oh, uh, the guy
was very charming.

08:49.345 --> 08:51.938
Oscar is obsessed
with his sauce.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.940
I will never say that
out loud again.

08:54.092 --> 08:55.182
-(chuckles)
-And apparently,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.944
my mother
has lived a whole secret life.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.353
Ooh, was she a spy?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.948
She has the cold indifference
of a spy.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.433
She does speak a little Russian.

09:03.451 --> 09:05.043
And she can knock back
a handle of vodka

09:05.120 --> 09:06.711
faster than a college student.

09:06.863 --> 09:08.046
KAT:
Who knows.

09:08.273 --> 09:09.289
You could be right.

09:09.441 --> 09:10.715
Turns out I know
very little about her.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.551
I had no idea
she lived in New York.

09:12.778 --> 09:15.945
Yeah, that's when she studied
with Bob Fosse.

09:15.964 --> 09:18.615
-What?
-You know: "Hoom,

09:18.633 --> 09:21.226
hoom, jazz."

09:22.971 --> 09:24.470
I didn't even know
she was a dancer.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.064
Oh, she stopped after she
broke her ankle at Woodstock.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.640
What... She was at Woodstock?

09:27.734 --> 09:30.960
Yeah, she hitchhiked there.
800 miles in a horse trailer.

09:31.129 --> 09:33.479
How do you guys
know all of this?

09:33.632 --> 09:35.465
I have a standing
coffee date with her.

09:35.483 --> 09:37.483
She comes in for a drink
sometimes. We chat.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.744
I always ask my elders
questions about their lives.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.413
They're our living history.

09:41.564 --> 09:43.915
What else don't I know?
Is she Banksy?

09:44.142 --> 09:46.233
Was she on the grassy knoll?

09:46.328 --> 09:48.645
No, but she did spend a weekend
at the Kennedy Compound.

09:48.663 --> 09:53.333
She said nothing wild happened,
but come on, it's the Kennedys.

09:53.501 --> 09:55.910
Do you know this kind of stuff
about your mom?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.596
Oh, yeah, everything.
I mean,

09:57.747 --> 09:59.505
since it's just the two of us,
we're really close.

09:59.658 --> 10:02.434
Like, she's my mom,
but we're also friends.

10:02.585 --> 10:04.269
You know?
Like the<i> Gilmore Girls.</i>

10:04.420 --> 10:08.164
Seriously, man,
I never understand you.

10:08.183 --> 10:10.350
I know too much about my mama.

10:10.502 --> 10:14.504
That's what happens when
you have to sponge-bathe them.

10:14.522 --> 10:16.339
You know, there are
so many things I wish I'd known

10:16.358 --> 10:18.508
about my dad before he died.

10:18.601 --> 10:20.434
Now I feel like I'm making
the same mistake

10:20.454 --> 10:22.178
with the parent
who's still living.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.681
So ask her about herself.

10:24.699 --> 10:26.349
She'll love that.

10:26.368 --> 10:28.701
Little tip: don't call her
an elder to her face.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.253
Well, that I know.

10:34.359 --> 10:36.801
Can you not shut a cabinet?

10:36.878 --> 10:38.136
Maybe I was doing inventory

10:38.287 --> 10:40.380
because someone
keeps stealing my cereal.

10:40.532 --> 10:42.790
Now what am I supposed to do
with this bowl of milk?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.200
Well, that's on you.

10:44.293 --> 10:46.561
What kind of a psychopath
pours the milk first?

10:50.967 --> 10:52.225
Phil, we got to figure this out.

10:52.377 --> 10:53.968
I can't wait another
six months for that sauce,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.378
I got a hankering I can't shake.

10:55.397 --> 10:58.231
Does this one taste
Cluck-tastic?

10:59.308 --> 11:01.234
Closer, but we're missing
the tanginess.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.219
I love when you say "we"
when I'm the one

11:03.238 --> 11:04.645
doing most
of the ding-dang work.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.500
Sorry, I get ugly when
I'm trying to solve a mystery.

11:08.727 --> 11:11.819
I almost stabbed Kat
during a game of<i> Clue.</i>

11:11.897 --> 11:15.231
Hey, is this dress too much
for dinner with my mom?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.416
How fancy is the restaurant?

11:16.568 --> 11:18.251
Oh, it's the same place
we went with Charles.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.161
I guess they carded her,
and in her words,

11:20.255 --> 11:22.180
"I'd like to go back
for more of that."

11:22.331 --> 11:24.073
It's perfect.
You look beautiful.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.184
I'm kind of nervous. You know,
it's kind of like a blind date.

11:26.335 --> 11:28.578
-I hope I like this Sheila.
-(chuckles)

11:28.596 --> 11:30.596
Oh, you're gonna love her.
She's a hoot.

11:30.749 --> 11:32.265
It's kind of exciting.
It's like starting

11:32.417 --> 11:33.340
a whole new chapter
of our relationship.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.193
Ooh, don't say "relationship"

11:35.344 --> 11:36.510
on a first date,
you'll scare her off.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.196
And be a gentleman.
Pull her chair out.

11:38.423 --> 11:39.939
Ooh, and bring mints
in case things go well

11:40.091 --> 11:41.199
and you get to smooching.

11:41.426 --> 11:43.092
Okay, this bit's
gone far enough.

11:43.111 --> 11:44.110
I felt that.

11:44.187 --> 11:47.872
Pickles. It was pickles.

11:48.024 --> 11:50.099
Phil, we cock-a-doodle-did it!

11:50.118 --> 11:53.002
Ah, there's that
ding-dang "we" again.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.881
Mmm, mmm, it's so good.

11:57.108 --> 11:58.717
Oh, you want some bagpipes
with that?

11:58.793 --> 12:00.427
(bagpipe playing)

12:02.614 --> 12:04.781
Carter, Carter,
come in here and settle this.

12:04.783 --> 12:06.799
Ugh, so close.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.968
Hey. How's everyone doing?

12:09.137 --> 12:10.878
-She keeps eating
all my junk food
-He won't stop with the bagpipes

12:10.897 --> 12:12.564
-and putting the boxes
away empty.
-and he's been loud-talking

12:12.791 --> 12:13.306
-Who does that?
-all over my apartment.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.548
Okay.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.901
Sounds like you both
have some valid concerns.

12:17.128 --> 12:18.478
And Carter agrees with me.

12:18.646 --> 12:21.464
He says that you talk too loud
and you suck at the bagpipes.

12:21.483 --> 12:22.982
-(gasps)
-Okay, yeah, that's not
exactly what I...

12:23.076 --> 12:24.075
Well, he told me
that your podcasts are dumb

12:24.152 --> 12:25.151
and you might be a murderer.

12:25.303 --> 12:26.227
-CARTER: Okay...
-(gasps)

12:26.321 --> 12:27.470
That was taken out of context.

12:27.563 --> 12:29.472
Well, what the hell
was the context?

12:29.491 --> 12:30.807
Oh, hold on-- I refuse
to get in trouble for this.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.141
You keep putting me
in the middle.

12:32.235 --> 12:33.400
How am I supposed
to choose between

12:33.420 --> 12:34.978
my girlfriend
and my best friend?

12:34.996 --> 12:37.814
-You're both annoying.
-(both gasp)

12:37.832 --> 12:40.407
And I'm not coming back here
until you two work this out.

12:40.502 --> 12:42.243
(scoffs)
It's a lost cause, Carter.

12:42.337 --> 12:45.004
Yeah, I'm never gonna get along
with Kilty McLoudass.

12:45.173 --> 12:48.558
Actually,
you just gave me an idea.

12:52.421 --> 12:53.846
Now, this is
the Get Along shirt.

12:54.015 --> 12:55.440
Stephanie and I used it
in couples therapy

12:55.667 --> 12:56.924
and because of it, our marriage
lasted two years longer

12:56.985 --> 12:58.276
than it should have.

12:58.427 --> 12:59.852
Now, you two are gonna
wear it until you figure out

12:59.946 --> 13:01.595
how to get along.

13:01.689 --> 13:04.507
We'll just take it off the
moment he walks out the door.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.192
Yeah, you do that, and
neither of you are getting any.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.703
Sex for you
and a paycheck for you.

13:09.864 --> 13:10.955
(door closes)

13:11.107 --> 13:13.182
How did he hear me?
I was whispering.

13:13.201 --> 13:16.002
No, you were not.

13:23.711 --> 13:24.877
Okay, so your favorite movie

13:24.971 --> 13:26.638
is<i> The Maltese Falcon,</i> noted.

13:26.865 --> 13:27.788
What's your favorite novel?

13:27.882 --> 13:29.549
<i> Lord of the Flies.</i>

13:29.701 --> 13:32.293
It reminds me of my time
on the pageant circuit.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.537
Interesting, I'll reread it
with that in mind.

13:34.630 --> 13:37.557
Uh, what about fears?
What's your biggest fear?

13:37.709 --> 13:39.058
I don't know.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.879
Spiders and the middle seat
on an airplane.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.213
Okay, here's a big one:

13:44.232 --> 13:45.882
What's one thing you would
change about your life

13:45.900 --> 13:48.785
-if you could?
-Agreeing to this dinner.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.145
I feel like you've spent
the whole time

13:51.164 --> 13:52.722
interrogating me.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.891
I'm not interrogating you.

13:54.909 --> 13:57.335
I'm just asking
very pointed questions

13:57.486 --> 14:00.321
to get information that you've
never disclosed to me before.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.509
Well, I'm exhausted, and we're
only on the first course.

14:04.660 --> 14:05.659
Where is this coming from?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.420
I'm worried
you could die tomorrow

14:07.496 --> 14:09.347
and I'll never know
your natural hair color.

14:09.498 --> 14:12.075
That one I'm taking
to the grave.

14:12.093 --> 14:14.760
Which apparently is coming
sooner than I thought.

14:14.929 --> 14:16.688
I'm sorry.
This is all coming out wrong.

14:16.839 --> 14:19.691
I'm trying to get to know you.
I thought this would be fun.

14:19.918 --> 14:22.768
Mm, yes, because being reminded
of my own mortality

14:22.921 --> 14:25.512
always puts me
in a festive mood.

14:25.607 --> 14:28.758
Come on, everybody else
knows your history but me.

14:28.851 --> 14:30.259
I mean, were you
the fifth Beatle?

14:30.353 --> 14:32.445
Are you a spy? Some people
think you might be a spy.

14:32.597 --> 14:34.263
Oh, honey,
now you're being ridiculous.

14:34.282 --> 14:37.100
Fine, I just, I won't ask
any more questions.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.102
-Fine.
-(slurps)

14:39.195 --> 14:40.378
Don't slurp, Katharine.

14:40.529 --> 14:42.529
I-I'm just enjoying
my soup, Mother.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.607
Does the whole restaurant
need to know that?

14:44.700 --> 14:46.609
This is why we'll never
be the<i> Gilmore Girls.</i>

14:46.611 --> 14:49.462
You'd rather criticize who I am
than talk to me.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.280
Good Lord,
you act like slurping soup

14:51.299 --> 14:53.892
is an inherent part
of your personality.

14:54.043 --> 14:55.226
Maybe it is.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.211
Hi, I'm Tom, I'll be taking
over for Sarah.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.471
How's everything so far?

14:58.623 --> 15:00.255
Great, Tom.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.975
Could I please get
a gin martini?

15:03.128 --> 15:04.143
Of course.

15:04.295 --> 15:05.628
Uh, did you need to see my ID?

15:05.647 --> 15:06.905
No.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.615
(stifled laugh)

15:09.910 --> 15:11.659
I liked Sarah better.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.395
Do you think he's gone?

15:14.489 --> 15:16.664
Maybe he's standing
outside the door.

15:19.144 --> 15:20.067
BOTH:
Ow!

15:20.161 --> 15:21.252
I'll do it.

15:21.404 --> 15:22.587
I just got to get my eye
to the hole.

15:22.738 --> 15:25.164
-Don't mansplain peepholes
to me.
-(grunts)

15:25.316 --> 15:27.041
He's gone.
All right, I'm taking this off.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.575
What-what,
and messing up my hair?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.512
-Absolutely not.
We are cutting this off.
-Okay.

15:32.415 --> 15:33.914
Wait, w... Where are you going?

15:33.934 --> 15:36.008
-(grunts) To get the scissors.
-No, but they're in the kitchen.

15:36.161 --> 15:36.935
No, they're in the couch.

15:37.162 --> 15:38.995
-Wait, why?
-I was trimming.

15:39.013 --> 15:40.680
What-what were you...
Oh, never mind,

15:40.774 --> 15:42.523
I don't even want to know.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.020
(grunts)

15:48.173 --> 15:49.763
-Goodness, get it...
-(grunts)

15:49.841 --> 15:53.009
Who does Carter think he is,
putting us on a time-out?

15:53.027 --> 15:55.027
I know, right?
Like he's so great.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.788
Maybe he should
look in the mirror.

15:56.939 --> 15:59.182
-Which he does all the time.
-(chuckles)

15:59.275 --> 16:01.960
And it's not just mirrors,
it's any reflective surface.

16:02.111 --> 16:06.038
Glass, spoon, puddle of water,
puddle of beer.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.373
He's really into puddles.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.358
(laughs)
Hey, you ever notice

16:09.377 --> 16:10.969
that when Carter drinks
soda water, that he swishes it

16:11.120 --> 16:12.786
around in his mouth
before he swallows it?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.547
Yes. I've asked him about that,

16:14.699 --> 16:16.398
and he said it's to get
the bubbles out.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.310
-Then why not just drink
regular water?
-(both laugh)

16:21.147 --> 16:23.206
(sighs)
Look,

16:23.224 --> 16:26.375
I've only ever lived with women
who were charmed by me.

16:26.544 --> 16:28.211
My mom thought
my quirks were cute,

16:28.304 --> 16:31.739
and Brigitte would forgive them
if we showered together.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.809
You know, this is all new to me.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.903
It's not just on you.

16:38.056 --> 16:39.480
I really wanted to live alone,

16:39.499 --> 16:42.000
so, I think even
if you were perfect,

16:42.151 --> 16:44.318
I'd still find stuff
to complain about.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.412
Well, that explains
why you were being so harsh

16:46.564 --> 16:48.414
-about my bagpipes.
-Oh, no, no, no.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.509
That was a perfectly
appropriate reaction.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.662
I guess this is gonna be
a bigger adjustment

16:55.682 --> 16:57.256
than we both thought.

16:57.408 --> 17:00.501
I'm willing to meet you halfway.

17:00.595 --> 17:02.094
Me too.

17:02.247 --> 17:04.022
You know what?
I promise, from now on,

17:04.173 --> 17:06.024
I will leave you
half of your cookies.

17:06.175 --> 17:09.602
-And I will close
half of your cabinets.
-(chuckles) Deal.

17:09.754 --> 17:11.937
-Should we toast to it?
-Yeah, I'll grab some beers.

17:12.014 --> 17:14.090
Oh, I got it.

17:14.108 --> 17:16.108
Wh... Why did you...

17:16.261 --> 17:18.995
You know what? Who cares.
You got some chips in here?

17:20.765 --> 17:22.689
Hey, why are you slowing down?

17:22.709 --> 17:25.268
You usually take stop signs
as a suggestion.

17:25.361 --> 17:27.603
I want to show you something.

17:27.622 --> 17:28.938
You see that house?

17:29.107 --> 17:31.865
That's where my high school
boyfriend lived.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.944
I used to sneak out,
scale that tree

17:35.037 --> 17:37.221
and climb in that window
just to see him.

17:37.373 --> 17:39.390
Bet Grandma didn't like that.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.060
Yeah, most of the time she
didn't even realize I was gone.

17:42.253 --> 17:44.211
-Really?
-(sighs)

17:44.305 --> 17:47.881
I used to do anything
to try to get her to notice me.

17:47.959 --> 17:51.051
Even winning all those pageants
didn't get her attention.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.645
Is that why you got into them?

17:52.721 --> 17:53.905
At first.

17:54.074 --> 17:58.600
But I kept at it 'cause
I look damn good in a tiara.

17:58.602 --> 17:59.969
You really do.

18:00.062 --> 18:02.413
You definitely upstaged me
at my bat mitzvah.

18:02.565 --> 18:03.581
Thank you.

18:03.732 --> 18:05.157
Look, the point is,

18:05.310 --> 18:08.160
my mom knew nothing about me.

18:08.254 --> 18:12.315
That's why I was happy to sit
back and listen to my daughter,

18:12.333 --> 18:14.074
and not talk about myself.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.077
Well, you definitely paid
attention to me. (chuckles)

18:17.171 --> 18:19.046
Some might say
hawk-like attention.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.690
(chuckles)
I might have overcorrected.

18:21.826 --> 18:23.159
Little bit.

18:23.177 --> 18:24.493
Being a mother is hard.

18:24.662 --> 18:26.253
You'll see when you have
your own child.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.515
Which you should really
get a move on, Katharine.

18:29.684 --> 18:31.517
Modern medicine has its limits.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.352
Mother.

18:33.504 --> 18:34.737
Okay.

18:37.191 --> 18:40.267
Why don't we get dinner
once a month?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.078
Just us.

18:43.531 --> 18:45.439
I'd love that.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.375
Me too.

18:49.778 --> 18:52.779
That's where my best friend,
Donna Simpson, lived.

18:52.874 --> 18:55.299
Oh, she was such a bitch.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.049
Hey, now, this is what
I like to see.

19:04.202 --> 19:05.551
Yep, your Get Along shirt
worked.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.645
And I'm sorry we put you in
the middle. That was not cool.

19:07.796 --> 19:10.606
Oh, it's okay, I'm just happy
I helped you two bond.

19:12.468 --> 19:13.634
Sure did.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.027
(chuckles)

19:17.473 --> 19:20.716
Doesn't it taste exactly
the same as Sergeant McCluck's?

19:20.735 --> 19:22.568
Some would say even better.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.811
It does taste exactly the same.

19:24.906 --> 19:26.647
Hey, ooh.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.315
You've been served.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.075
A cease and desist letter?

19:30.228 --> 19:31.502
Dang, I knew we shouldn't
have bragged about

19:31.729 --> 19:33.004
our copycat recipe online.

19:33.155 --> 19:36.966
And I thought TikTok
was a safe space.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.736
This is me at Woodstock.

19:40.829 --> 19:43.739
Oh, I forgot how good I look
in bell-bottoms.

19:43.832 --> 19:45.574
You're not wearing a shirt.

19:45.668 --> 19:49.061
Sweetheart, with boobs
like that, why would I?

19:50.172 --> 19:52.097
What... What is this?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.749
The remains of my wedding dress.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.193
What happened to it?

19:55.344 --> 19:58.754
Your father ripped it off me
before the rice hit the ground.

19:58.847 --> 20:01.181
Okay, little TMI.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.849
Well, what do you expect?
We waited till marriage,

20:02.944 --> 20:04.760
so he was like a wild animal...

20:04.779 --> 20:07.613
Okay, no more Sheila,
go back to Mom, go back to Mom.
