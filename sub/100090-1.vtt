WEBVTT

00:06.528 --> 00:08.356
- Be honest, when was
the last time you used?

00:08.399 --> 00:09.487
- Today.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.228
- What the hell
are we gonna do?

00:11.272 --> 00:13.491
- We had one chance
to make this right,

00:13.535 --> 00:15.319
and you blew it.
This is my unit.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.844
I take the heat.
I take the bullet.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.804
- Don't worry about me, Hank.
Worry about yourself.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.023
Kelton is coming for you.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.721
- I will do everything I can

00:25.764 --> 00:28.593
to make sure he does
not disband Intelligence.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.856
- You're playing
a dangerous game here.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.423
- So are you.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.903
- Why are you doing this?

00:33.946 --> 00:36.340
- There was only one choice
that I could live with.

00:36.384 --> 00:40.518
- Today, we have made history.

00:40.562 --> 00:44.696
Today is the start
of a new beginning.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.266
- If there is something
that I need to know,

00:49.310 --> 00:51.007
then you have to tell me.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.313
- I'm going to see Kelton.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.879
Do what needs to be done.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.546
- All right, I want a joint op

01:08.590 --> 01:10.722
between Homicide
and Intelligence.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.594
Every eye on the city is on us,
so you go hard,

01:12.637 --> 01:14.030
but you make sure
you do it right.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.379
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.164
- Can we get the news
helicopters out of here?

01:17.207 --> 01:18.339
Tell them to show some respect.

01:18.382 --> 01:19.775
Sergeant Voight on scene?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.385
- I just spoke to him.
He's on his way.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.561
- Good. Detective, how'd it go
with Kelton's driver?

01:23.605 --> 01:25.563
We get anything helpful?
- Not really, sir.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.174
He said he said he dropped
Kelton off around 10:00,

01:27.217 --> 01:28.218
then he went
to get the mayor-elect

01:28.262 --> 01:29.219
cigarettes and Advil.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.481
When he got back
25 minutes later

01:30.525 --> 01:31.613
is when he found the body.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.615
- Okay.
Updates on the hour.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.879
- I'll handle
the progress reports.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.228
You hit me with your IPRs.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.360
Sound good?
- Absolutely.

01:39.403 --> 01:42.189
- Detective Terkla.
You got a sec?

01:42.232 --> 01:43.799
- So Voight's on his way?

01:43.842 --> 01:45.583
- I don't know.
I was just covering.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.543
- Covering? Why?
What are you talking about?

01:48.586 --> 01:50.197
- Earlier today, Voight said

01:50.240 --> 01:53.025
he was going to see Kelton...

01:53.069 --> 01:55.202
to do what needs to be done.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.554
- Thanks, man.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.469
All right, what do we got?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
- Acting Superintendent
Crawford wants us

02:47.254 --> 02:49.212
running it with Homicide.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.996
- We got a lot of eyes on this.
Makes sense.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.173
- Hank, I need a word.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.304
In private.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.525
- You can talk
in front of Halstead.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.004
- We just found a witness.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.485
Saw a black SUV
driving near Kelton's house

03:01.529 --> 03:02.660
around the time of the murder.

03:02.704 --> 03:05.576
The SUV was driving slow,
suspiciously.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.577
- Okay.

03:06.621 --> 03:07.709
- I had CPIC run traffic cams

03:07.752 --> 03:10.190
on any black SUVs
in the vicinity.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.669
Got three hits.

03:11.713 --> 03:15.717
75-year-old grandfather,
soccer mom...

03:15.760 --> 03:17.284
and your SUV.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.417
- You're asking
if I killed Kelton?

03:31.602 --> 03:32.821
- No sign of forced entry.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.823
Nothing suggesting
robbery or home invasion,

03:34.866 --> 03:36.259
so it looks
a whole hell of a lot like

03:36.303 --> 03:38.261
whoever did it,
they knew Kelton.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.220
- All right,
shell casings recovered?

03:40.263 --> 03:42.047
- No.
They policed their brass.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.614
- How about his phone?

03:43.658 --> 03:45.355
- A lot
of congratulatory texts,

03:45.399 --> 03:46.661
but, um, all the calls

03:46.704 --> 03:48.228
are either personal
or campaign-related.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.317
Also looks like you called him.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.927
Around noon.

03:51.970 --> 03:52.928
- Hmm.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.370
- Hank.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.676
- Hey, Kate.
- I just got here.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.373
What the hell happened?

04:03.417 --> 04:05.810
- Just started working it.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.073
- Any suspects?
- Not yet.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.901
- There's gonna be a long list.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.512
- Yep.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.035
You talk to him
since he resigned?

04:13.078 --> 04:14.602
- I haven't.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.778
So I don't know too much.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.345
Poor bastard.
Finally got what he wanted.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.129
Had to go out like this.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.088
- A hell of a thing.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.439
- Call me if you need me.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.005
Despite the political
differences,

04:27.049 --> 04:28.920
I did love the man.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.884
- Hey, you talk to Antonio
this morning?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.015
- No, not today.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.408
All right, what do we got?

04:38.452 --> 04:39.757
- No one's heard from him
since last night,

04:39.801 --> 04:40.889
and he's not
responding to texts.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.238
That's not like him.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.414
- I'll reach out to him
in a bit.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.416
- All right,
so a burner phone was recovered

04:46.460 --> 04:47.504
from Kelton's personal vehicle.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.289
OCD ran muds and tolls.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.856
Lot of cryptic texts going back
and forth with other burners.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.946
- Someone named Slo-Mo texted
Kelton three times yesterday.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.121
9:00 a.m. he writes,

04:56.165 --> 04:57.079
"Not cool.
Need to talk.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.385
"Hit me back for a meet."

04:58.428 --> 05:00.343
An hour later,
"I ain't playin'."

05:00.387 --> 05:02.302
Then at 6:00 p.m.,
he goes all caps,

05:02.345 --> 05:03.564
"Watch your back, bitch."

05:03.607 --> 05:04.869
Four hours later,
Kelton's dead.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.958
- We get a hit
on this Slo-Mo's phone?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.786
- The phone was shut off today,
but all the prior texts

05:08.830 --> 05:10.353
pinged off a cell tower
in Englewood

05:10.397 --> 05:12.703
on a block known to be
a Southside hustler stronghold.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.878
- No hits on a Slo-Mo
in the database.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.315
- All right,
well, we need a name.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.012
I want boots on the ground now.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.883
- I'll get the warrant going.
- I said now.

05:23.932 --> 05:24.889
- Move in.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.982
Chicago PD!
Nobody move!

05:32.201 --> 05:33.463
- Hey, get the runner.
Get the runner.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.899
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.597
- Put your hands up!
- Get your hands up!

05:36.640 --> 05:38.860
- Over here.
- Hands up.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.165
- Get your ass
to the white line.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.471
Stop playing.

05:41.515 --> 05:42.907
- Gun!
- Hey, yo.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.300
I got a permit for that.
- Shut up.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.475
Put your hands
behind your back.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.607
- I got him.
I got him.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.394
We are just looking for Slo-Mo.
Is that one of you?

05:51.438 --> 05:53.918
- Just give us the Slo-Mo info,
and we'll bounce.

05:53.962 --> 05:54.876
Hands up.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.664
- What is this?

06:00.708 --> 06:03.363
That's a free ride
to the station.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.842
Unless you want
to give me a name.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.280
No? All right, put your hands
behind your back.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.412
Let's go.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.502
- Curtis.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.069
Slo-Mo's name is Curtis.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.418
- Does Curtis have a last name?

06:15.462 --> 06:18.595
- Yeah, I think it's Monroe.
Like the street.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.118
- All right, play this off.
We'll let you go.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.076
Get in the car.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.212
Slo-Mo's real name
is Curtis Monroe.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.780
Mid-level player, self-admitted
Southside hustler.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.913
He's got an extensive sheet.
He did two stints inside.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.480
- All right,
known gang associates?

06:33.523 --> 06:34.872
- Yeah, hold on a sec.
Here we go.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.832
Look at this.
Wilson Young.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.703
- Wilson Young?
The same one?

06:39.747 --> 06:41.401
- Yeah, it's the same one
Kelton had killed

06:41.444 --> 06:42.532
so he could win the election.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.229
It also happens
to be Monroe's cousin.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.579
- Cousin looking for revenge.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.319
- All right, so where's
this Monroe hang his hat?

06:47.363 --> 06:50.061
- Uh, did six months in Dixon,

06:50.105 --> 06:52.020
then he spent three weeks
in a halfway house.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.413
He does dry after that--
the kid that ID'd Monroe,

06:53.456 --> 06:54.718
he doesn't know where
he lives either.

06:54.762 --> 06:55.632
- All right, well,
let's find him.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.808
Start digging.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.201
Kevin.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.159
I need you to do
a pickup for me.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.695
- You made bail.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.262
Sergeant Voight
posted it this morning.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.439
Let's go.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.136
Let's go.
Come on.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.879
- It's your lucky day,
Poe-Poe.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.446
Next time,
you're gonna leave in a box.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.709
- Get your ass in the cell.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.451
Hope you like being alone.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.322
Protective custody cells
down in Stateville

07:33.365 --> 07:34.758
are twice as small as these.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.195
And the inmates
are twice as nasty.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.937
- Good to know.
Thanks for the advice.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.765
- Just saying.

07:41.809 --> 07:45.639
You want to survive prison,
get used to being alone.

07:51.949 --> 07:52.994
- My boy.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.735
- You my Uber?

07:54.778 --> 07:57.346
- I usually don't pick up
two-star passengers, but, yeah.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.652
How you feel?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.175
- Good, yeah.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.177
Yo, the guard just told me
about Kelton.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.527
- Crazy, right?
- We got any suspects?

08:04.571 --> 08:07.312
- Uh, South Side hustler
named Monroe.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.053
There's no real evidence.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.012
You think Voight
had something to do with it?

08:20.456 --> 08:22.066
- All right.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.067
Thanks, bro.

08:24.329 --> 08:25.374
- No doubt.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.506
- Listen, you all right?

08:26.549 --> 08:27.811
Hey.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.161
You been pretty quiet
the whole ride.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.554
- I gotta be honest
with you, dog.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.686
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

08:32.729 --> 08:33.991
about what was going down
with IAD.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.384
- I wanted to talk
to you about it.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.603
I just didn't want
to drag you into it.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.256
That's all.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.084
- I just wish I knew.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.259
- Yeah.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.435
Kev, there's nothing
you could've done.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.611
Trust me.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.006
- So what happens next?

08:50.617 --> 08:51.879
- I wait for trial.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.708
- What about work?
You on desk duty?

08:54.751 --> 08:57.580
- As of today, I am stripped
of all my police powers.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.193
Damn.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.238
- Yeah.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.587
- Kev, you copy?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.110
- Yeah.
Go, Jay.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.677
- We flipped
a friend of Monroe's.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.200
Looks like word got out
we're after him.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.028
Monroe's holed up
in a stash house.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.552
Pre-raid meet with Homicide
in 20 minutes.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.857
Addison and Whitney.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.903
- Copy that.
I'm on my way.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.428
Hey, don't trip, dog.
You'll be back shotgun no time.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
- Yeah, I hope so.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.431
All right, be careful.
You call me later, all right?

09:22.474 --> 09:23.693
- No doubt.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.145
- It's a two-bedroom apartment.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.320
There's two Rottweilers
for security.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.931
- Can't wait to meet them.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.454
- All right, Intelligence
is gonna do the breach.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.629
We got the front.
- Copy that.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.022
- Damn.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.589
There he is.
Right there.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.373
- Curtis Monroe!
- I'll cover the back.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.635
- Am I good?
Am I good?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
- Okay, okay!
Go, go, go, go!

09:56.639 --> 09:57.814
- Gun!
- Sir, get down.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.120
Kids, flat.
Behind me.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.513
To the door, to the door.
Behind me.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.690
You got him?
- Yeah.

10:03.733 --> 10:08.303
Got him going in the back near
the first door in the corner.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.617
Stop!
Police!

10:19.401 --> 10:20.445
- Police!
Freeze!

10:21.795 --> 10:24.275
Drop the gun!

10:24.319 --> 10:25.494
On your knees!

10:25.537 --> 10:26.626
- Drop it, Monroe!

10:26.669 --> 10:29.716
- Drop the gun!

10:29.759 --> 10:30.673
- Ya'll gonna kill me
right here.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.283
I know it.
- Drop it!

10:32.327 --> 10:33.589
- I got this!

10:33.633 --> 10:34.764
Hey.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.679
You want to live?
Huh?

10:36.723 --> 10:38.550
Answer me.
Do you want to live?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.856
- Yeah!
- Okay.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.336
Then come in with me.
You'll get a fair shake.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.816
Just drop the gun.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.513
- You got three seconds
to put it down.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.123
One.
- Stand down!

10:46.167 --> 10:47.647
- What the hell are you doing?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.126
- It's not going down
like that today.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.128
- Drop it, Monroe!
- Stand down.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.303
- Drop it now!
- Stand down!

10:52.347 --> 10:53.565
Okay?
- Two!

10:53.609 --> 10:54.828
- Don't do it!
Listen to me.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.394
Drop the gun, bro.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.613
Just drop the gun.
Don't look at them.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.962
Look at me.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.703
Just come in with me.
You'll get a fair shake.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.183
Just drop the gun.
- Do it now.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.228
- Come on.
Just ease it down.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.056
Lower it down.
There you go.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.319
Just put it on the ground.
Put the gun on the ground.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.626
There it is.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.019
- Take him.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.935
- Get down.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.467
- Like I keep telling you,

11:25.510 --> 11:26.598
I was hanging out
in Ogden Park.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.426
Couldn't be
in two places at once.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.734
- Who you hanging out with?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.431
- No one.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.824
- Do you know Brian Kelton?

11:34.868 --> 11:36.130
- Heard of him.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.653
- You ever call him?
Text him?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.221
- The next mayor?
You kidding?

11:43.528 --> 11:46.314
- So you're telling me
you didn't send these texts?

11:47.924 --> 11:48.882
Curtis.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.625
You want to think
before you answer.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.192
Did you lie to me?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.937
You're not gonna like
how this ends.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.460
- Yeah, I sent them.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.245
Don't mean
I gave him the smoke.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.334
Not that I'm crying
for his punk ass either.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.857
Look, he killed
my cousin Wilson.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.206
Kelton deserve what he get.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.295
- So you're saying
you know something about it?

12:11.339 --> 12:12.732
- I ain't saying nothing
of that sort.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.386
- But you admit
to sending Kelton the texts.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.475
- Yeah, I admit that.
Dude wouldn't pay up.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.390
- For what?
- Come on, bro.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.522
You really saying
you ain't know

12:20.565 --> 12:21.741
Kelton was working with us?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.046
- Pretend I don't.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.787
- We helped get
his white ass the election.

12:24.831 --> 12:29.139
We pressed lots of blocks,
and sent lots of votes his way.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.706
But he never paid up.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.230
- How much?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.580
- Ten G's.
Wasn't just us, though.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.713
Dude had dead money
all over the streets.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.324
Word was he was hemmed up
with the Latin players too.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.718
- Yeah.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.992
- Your alibi
checks out, Curtis.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.342
- We got you on surveillance
in Ogden Park.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.170
Smoking a big, fat blunt.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.172
- So can I go now?

13:02.216 --> 13:04.871
- You pulled a gun
on the police.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.394
What do you think?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.143
- You're welcome,
by the way.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.536
- Excuse me?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.103
- You and your boy
came pretty damn close

13:20.147 --> 13:22.018
to shooting a black man
that didn't have anything to do

13:22.062 --> 13:24.281
with that murder.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.501
Way I see it,
I saved your career.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.378
- Antonio, it's me again.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.380
Hit me back when you get this.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.121
Hey, have you heard
from Antonio?

13:38.165 --> 13:40.645
- No.
- Something's not right.

13:40.689 --> 13:46.086
- All right, Monroe's cleared,
so we're back to square one.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.609
So here's what we know.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.306
Kelton opened the door
for the assailant.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.134
That suggests
it was personal, right?

13:51.178 --> 13:55.573
So dead cousins, gangbangers,
debts not paid, whatever.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.401
We keep digging.
Hit the streets.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.273
Talk to your CIs.
Let's go.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.584
- What do you think?

14:06.628 --> 14:09.892
- I think we keep digging
like he said.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.764
If he did it, he wouldn't have
us out there risking our lives.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.332
Voight's a lot of things,
but selfish isn't one of them.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.162
What's up?

14:19.206 --> 14:20.816
- Techs got a lead on the gun.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.996
- Here's the bullet that ME
pulled from Kelton's rib cage,

14:27.040 --> 14:29.303
and this bullet was recovered
three years ago

14:29.346 --> 14:30.913
from a liquor store robbery.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.655
And the bullets
have identical striations.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.222
- So the gun used
in the robbery is the same gun

14:35.265 --> 14:36.136
that was used to kill Kelton.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.442
- Yeah, a .9mm.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.835
I'll go print you a report.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.836
- Thanks.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.927
- Looks like the nine
was never recovered.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
Case was dropped
due to lack of evidence,

14:46.711 --> 14:49.758
but they had a suspect.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.325
- Franco Chavaro.
Latin player.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.283
Got pinched twice
for drug trafficking.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.894
- Yeah, I recognize him,
and we know Kelton

14:54.937 --> 14:56.417
was in business
with Latin players.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.810
- So maybe Kelton owed
this guy money too.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.943
Let's go pick him up.
- Yeah.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.296
- All right,
we stay in the shadows

15:06.340 --> 15:08.516
till Chavaro's alone.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.953
Stand by.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.567
All right, take him.

15:20.789 --> 15:24.401
- Franco Chavaro, Chicago PD.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.099
Yep, there you go.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.579
- Yo, what the hell
is this about, man?

15:28.623 --> 15:30.146
What the hell
is this about, man?

15:30.190 --> 15:31.669
- Brian Kelton.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.410
- What, you think I had
something to do with that?

15:33.454 --> 15:34.977
- Did you?
- Hell, no, man.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.675
I never even--yo, I never
even met the guy, man!

15:37.719 --> 15:39.460
Ya'll crazy.
- Settle down.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.635
- No, don't tell me
to settle down.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.506
I ain't done nothing.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.378
- Where were you
last night, Franco?

15:44.421 --> 15:46.946
- I was in Detroit
visiting my sister.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.469
I got home this morning.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.340
Yo, I'm not carrying
anything, bro.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.300
No drugs, no gun.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.215
- So you're not
carrying that 9-mil

15:55.258 --> 15:57.173
you like to rob
liquor stores with?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.785
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.527
- You're taking a ride with us.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.011
- Well, Chavaro's
sticking to his story.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.970
Asking for a lawyer.

16:11.013 --> 16:11.753
You search his place?

16:11.796 --> 16:14.147
- No guns.
No drugs.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.105
- What about his phone?
- Nothing useful.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.629
No communication with Kelton,
and the cell tower ping

16:18.673 --> 16:21.067
puts it in South Detroit
time of the murder.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.025
I don't think
this is the guy, Sarge.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.026
You want to kick him?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.201
- No.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.464
His gun was used
to kill Kelton.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.944
Maybe he ordered
somebody to do it.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.773
Either way, I am telling you,
he knows something.

16:31.816 --> 16:32.904
All right, well, Hailey said

16:32.948 --> 16:34.297
she's got a CI
that knows Chavaro.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.995
So maybe she can
find some leverage.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.735
- Okay.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.955
Look, I've been
calling Antonio.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.044
His phone's off.
Have you heard from him?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.567
- No.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.787
No one else has either.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.745
I gotta be honest,
the last time I saw him,

16:47.789 --> 16:49.051
he wasn't in good shape.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.923
- Okay.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.664
You and Hailey
keep working this case.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.101
chase down this CI.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.319
- What about Antonio?

16:56.363 --> 16:57.755
- Call Adam.
Have him check it out.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.627
It's better he stays busy.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.720
- Antonio?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.118
Thank you, sir.
I got it from here.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.119
Thanks.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.086
Sarge, it's Adam.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.826
Look, I'm leaving
Antonio's place.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.437
He's not here,
it's a complete mess,

18:10.480 --> 18:12.482
and he left his badge behind.

18:12.526 --> 18:13.744
Something's definitely wrong.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.050
- Did you try his cell?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.225
- It's off.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.009
Look, I don't want
to set off alarms,

18:18.053 --> 18:20.142
but I need you to run GPS
on his vehicle, okay?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.971
- Yeah, I'll call you
as soon as I get a location.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.452
Hey, by the way,
I'm really glad you're out.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.062
So stay safe, okay?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.063
- Thanks, Sarge.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.832
Come on, Antonio.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.225
- Hey, what the hell you doing?

18:59.268 --> 19:00.922
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.187
Where's Antonio Dawson?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.667
- Who the hell are you?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.147
- I work with him.
Who the hell are you?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.496
You his dealer?

19:09.539 --> 19:12.455
- No.
I'm his sponsor.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.066
- His sponsor?
- Yeah.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.894
- Sorry, man.
My bad.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.114
- It's all good, man.
He showed up late last night.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.463
Said he checked
into a hospital,

19:20.507 --> 19:21.943
but couldn't take it--
drove here, wanted to talk.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.249
- Is he here with you?

19:23.292 --> 19:24.424
- Nah, he took off.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.468
- You know where he went?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.078
- I don't know.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.776
I mean, we were up
late last night just talking.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.473
He was in bad shape,

19:30.517 --> 19:31.953
so I did what I could
to help out.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.650
So we went to a good place.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.043
Once I figured that out,

19:35.086 --> 19:37.654
I went to bed,
around 4:00, 4:30.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.395
But when I woke up,
the man was gone.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.184
- I mean, his car's still here.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.273
- I don't know
what else to tell you, man.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.796
- Thank you.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.625
- Love.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.158
- You sure?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.205
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.164
All right.
Thanks for checking in, Adam.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.600
- Antonio missing?

20:10.644 --> 20:12.036
- Since 4:00 a.m.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.342
- He using?

20:13.386 --> 20:14.691
- Yeah, it looks like it.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.913
- Here's my CI.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.350
What's up, Jorge?
Thanks for meeting.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.135
- Don't really have
a choice, huh?

20:24.179 --> 20:25.093
- Look, man,
Hailey says you're tight

20:25.136 --> 20:26.050
with Franco Chavaro.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.530
- Yeah, why?

20:27.574 --> 20:29.315
What do you want with him?
He's a good dude.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.403
- Good dude or not,
we need to know

20:30.446 --> 20:32.013
where he keeps his product.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.667
- Come on, Hailey, you putting
me in a bad situation.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.408
- No, you put yourself
in a bad situation

20:35.451 --> 20:37.061
when you got hooked on dope
and started doing robberies.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.237
Look, it's simple, man.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.499
You can help us
and stay on the outside,

20:39.542 --> 20:40.804
or not, and go to jail,
it's up to you.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.067
- Slow down.
Ain't no need to write paper.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.461
I'll help.
Promise.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.897
I can't guarantee nothing.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.203
- That's okay.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.552
Just tell us everything
you know about Chavaro.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.162
We want to know about
his business, his life,

20:51.206 --> 20:53.164
his family,
and then we're cool.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.474
- Chicago PD.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.259
You got the saw?
Follow me to the back.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.477
- All right, ladies, stay calm.

21:01.521 --> 21:02.826
Hands where we can see them,
all right?

21:02.870 --> 21:03.784
- What the hell is going on?

21:03.827 --> 21:05.351
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.917
- We have a warrant
to search the premises.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.179
- Search for what?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.312
- Weapons of mass destruction.
- What?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.227
- Just kidding.
Drugs and guns.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.620
We're gonna go in here.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.579
- Got it.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.580
Hit it.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.285
- Come on.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.286
- Wait, where you taking him?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.374
- I got this, Jay.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.331
- There's a lot of eyes
on this, Sarge.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.420
- I said I got this.

21:31.464 --> 21:32.856
- Hey, Elena.
Que pasó?

21:34.162 --> 21:35.555
- They raided my salon.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.252
- Yeah, found a kilo
of cocaine,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.602
three unregistered firearms.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.996
Since the lease
is in Elena's name... come on.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.258
- Yo, why are you
doing this, man?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.433
I told you I didn't
kill the mayor.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.435
- Because you refuse
to cooperate.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.263
- Because I don't
know anything, bro!

21:48.307 --> 21:49.786
- Yeah, well, then I'm gonna
have to charge your wife

21:49.830 --> 21:51.962
with felony distribution
and possession--

21:52.006 --> 21:53.964
- Okay, okay, all right.
You win.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.053
I'll tell you what I know,
but you gotta let her go.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.794
No charges.
No nothing.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.493
- Franco, you cooperate,

22:00.536 --> 22:02.973
she'll be back painting nails
in an hour.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.540
Come on.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.590
- So if I talk,
you're not gonna charge me

22:10.633 --> 22:12.243
with that crime,
is that what you're saying?

22:12.287 --> 22:13.506
- That's correct.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.814
- It's now or never, Franco.
Where's your gun?

22:17.858 --> 22:20.077
The one you used in the liquor
store robbery in 2016.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.688
- I don't got it no more.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.211
- You sell it?

22:23.254 --> 22:24.952
- No, it was stolen from me

22:24.995 --> 22:27.041
about a month
after I hit that liquor store.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.738
It was a Sig Sauer, man.
P210.

22:28.782 --> 22:29.565
Sweet-ass gun.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.219
- You know who took it?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.003
- A cop.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.354
- Excuse me?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.094
- Do you remember that big bust

22:37.138 --> 22:39.053
about three years ago
in Pilsen?

22:39.096 --> 22:40.489
Y'all arrested
about 60 bangers?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.404
Hit everyone's crib?
- So?

22:42.448 --> 22:43.971
- Yeah, well,
I got rolled up in all that.

22:44.014 --> 22:47.235
And when I got out on bond,
my Sig was gone.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.411
I had it
in a good hiding spot too.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.761
And the only person
that could've taken it

22:51.805 --> 22:53.589
that was in my crib
after that arrest

22:53.633 --> 22:54.808
was a cop.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
So...

23:01.641 --> 23:03.991
if y'all are telling
the truth,

23:04.034 --> 23:07.473
and that gun was used
to kill the mayor,

23:07.516 --> 23:10.084
then dude who pulled
the trigger wears blue.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.221
- You believe him?

23:17.265 --> 23:18.397
- I don't know.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.705
I mean, truth is,
doesn't really matter.

23:22.749 --> 23:24.707
He's not pointing
at anyone specific.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.406
Just throwing out
general accusations.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.322
All the same...

23:32.889 --> 23:35.414
It's probably best
we don't download Homicide.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.111
If a cop really is involved,

23:37.154 --> 23:39.418
the fewer police know,
the better.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.900
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

23:45.859 --> 23:47.513
- No, all good.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.390
- Okay, so do you think--
- Wait, hold on a second.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.093
- Do you think
Chavaro's telling the truth?

24:03.137 --> 24:05.356
- He was definitely arrested
in that raid in 2016,

24:05.400 --> 24:06.923
so he's telling
the truth about that.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.012
- That doesn't mean
a cop stole his gun.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.670
So what are you talking about?

24:18.282 --> 24:21.198
- I'm not saying
Voight's involved.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.461
But the dots
are starting to connect,

24:22.504 --> 24:23.766
and not in a good way.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.856
- Jay, just say
what you want to say.

24:31.295 --> 24:34.908
- Voight was one of the cops
involved in that raid in 2016.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.302
Given his relationship Kelton

24:38.346 --> 24:40.827
and what we know
he's capable of...

24:42.959 --> 24:45.614
- I understand,
but I also just don't think

24:45.658 --> 24:47.703
there's enough evidence
to reach that conclusion.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.924
- I hope you're right.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.883
But...

24:53.927 --> 24:55.711
- But what?

24:55.755 --> 24:58.845
- But I don't think we can just
look the other way either.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.507
- What is it?

25:08.550 --> 25:11.684
- That Homicide cop Terkla,
he wants to meet.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.686
He says it's important.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.561
- Thanks for meeting me.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.824
- Yeah, sure thing.
So what's up?

25:21.868 --> 25:23.565
- Look,
I'm gonna shoot you straight,

25:23.609 --> 25:27.656
'cause I hear you're a solid
cop and a solid person.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.266
The evidence
is starting to point

25:29.310 --> 25:32.269
in a certain
uncomfortable direction.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.184
- I don't know what that means.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.579
- It means your boss Voight
is our lead suspect.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.799
We did the math, same as you.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.670
I got wind
you had Chavaro in custody,

25:41.714 --> 25:45.021
which you didn't share.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.546
I know the gun used
in the murder connects back

25:47.589 --> 25:49.199
to a raid
Voight was involved with.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.333
Means he had access
to the murder weapon.

25:52.376 --> 25:53.595
- Seriously?
That's your evidence?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.118
A lot of cops
are involved in raids, man.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.686
- Yeah, but none of those
other cops were engaged

25:57.730 --> 26:00.602
in a holy war
with the dead guy,

26:00.646 --> 26:03.083
or had their fingerprints
on a scotch glass

26:03.126 --> 26:04.954
in his living room.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.263
Look, I'm just giving you
a heads-up, Jay.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.874
That's it.
Out of respect.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.528
- Respect?
You're calling this respect?

26:13.572 --> 26:14.921
You're telling me
my boss is a murderer?

26:14.964 --> 26:18.707
- Every powerful eye in
the city's watching this case.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.970
One way or another,
we're gonna find the killer.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.581
We just are.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.018
And when we do,
we will have probable cause

26:25.061 --> 26:26.715
to charge every one of yous
with obstruction.

26:26.759 --> 26:27.847
- Are you threatening me?

26:27.890 --> 26:29.152
You call me here
to threaten me?

26:29.196 --> 26:31.894
- I'm giving you a way out.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.026
Work with me.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.331
Help me build a case.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.637
- All right,
you can go to hell.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.161
- You really want
to throw away your career,

26:38.205 --> 26:39.598
you life, to protect Voight?

26:39.641 --> 26:40.642
- He's innocent.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.601
- If you really believe that,

26:42.644 --> 26:45.081
you got nothing to worry about.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.300
Look, sometimes,

26:46.343 --> 26:49.085
you gotta look out for you,
no one but you.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.610
- All right, have a nice day.
- This is one of those times!

27:00.227 --> 27:02.359
- I'm not saying Terkel
was right or wrong.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.622
I'm just telling you
what he said.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.015
- So he said Voight's good
for Kelton's murder?

27:06.059 --> 27:07.669
- He said Voight
is his lead suspect.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.324
Again, those are his words,
not mine.

27:10.367 --> 27:14.197
But all of the evidence,
it's all accurate.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.243
- So you think Voight
could be involved?

27:19.115 --> 27:20.987
- Could be.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.162
I guess so, I...

27:23.729 --> 27:25.948
- Okay, let's say that he is.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.167
What's our play?

27:28.951 --> 27:30.692
- Look, guys...

27:30.736 --> 27:34.217
Terkel also said that
if Voight is good for this,

27:34.261 --> 27:35.610
we're all gonna
get investigated

27:35.654 --> 27:37.133
and charged with obstruction.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.527
- He's just threatening.
Trying to get you to cooperate.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.050
- I know, I'm just telling you
what he said,

27:41.094 --> 27:42.661
so we all know where we're at,

27:42.704 --> 27:43.966
what the risks are.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.925
- So what exactly
did you tell him, Jay?

27:45.968 --> 27:47.883
- I told him to go to hell.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.929
Now you have all the info.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.715
- Doesn't matter to me
how much info I got.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.543
Ain't no way in hell I'm siding
with Homicide over Voight,

27:55.586 --> 27:56.936
guilty or not.

27:58.764 --> 27:59.634
- Yeah, neither am I.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.505
- Me too.

28:01.549 --> 28:02.593
- I'm with you guys.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.509
- Okay.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.947
So it's unanimous.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.688
What's the next move?

28:15.258 --> 28:16.695
- What's going on?

28:24.398 --> 28:28.141
- M-my head is swimming
right now.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.970
- Okay, what are you
talking about?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.929
- Look, I just want to know

28:33.973 --> 28:36.889
what's going on with you,
with Kelton,

28:36.932 --> 28:38.325
for real.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.761
- Jay...

28:39.805 --> 28:41.067
- Are you involved?

28:41.110 --> 28:42.982
- Watch yourself.

28:46.899 --> 28:50.163
You don't want to say something
you can't walk back.

28:50.206 --> 28:53.949
- Sarge, your prints
are at his house.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.298
- Mm-hmm.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.126
That's because
I was at Kelton's

28:57.170 --> 28:58.780
the day before the murder.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.826
I went there to try
and talk him down.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.001
- Well, what about last night?

29:02.044 --> 29:03.611
What were you doing there?

29:03.654 --> 29:05.744
Why wouldn't you just say
what you were doing?

29:08.703 --> 29:11.358
- Because if I said
what I was doing...

29:13.142 --> 29:15.710
Antonio will lose his job.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.499
- You were with Antonio.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.720
- He called me when
I was heading over to Kelton's.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.028
I turned around,
picked him up...

29:31.030 --> 29:33.641
He was in bad shape.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.078
I took him
to an off-the-books clinic.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.604
- You should've said something.

29:40.648 --> 29:44.217
- It was between me
and Antonio.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.352
- Okay.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.878
They're circling you.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.836
And they're building a case.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.664
- Listen, Jay...

29:56.707 --> 29:58.797
Jay, on my son...

30:00.276 --> 30:02.148
I didn't kill Kelton.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.501
- Okay.

30:09.764 --> 30:10.896
I had to ask you.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.767
- No, you didn't.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.129
- Okay, so I've been digging
through the paperwork

30:27.173 --> 30:29.610
regarding the 2016
Latin Player raid,

30:29.653 --> 30:31.090
like you asked.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.874
One unit's report
was missing from the pack,

30:32.918 --> 30:34.267
so I followed up.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.051
Found three more names of cops

30:36.095 --> 30:37.444
who were involved
in the operation.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.837
- Good.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.578
- Two of the three
checked out as solid citizens,

30:41.622 --> 30:44.712
but the third,
detective named David Baker,

30:44.755 --> 30:46.627
was kicked off the force
last year

30:46.670 --> 30:48.934
for stealing
from offenders' homes.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.936
Drugs, guns, TVs.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.285
You name it, he stole it.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.376
- You saying Baker
stole the Sig Sauer?

30:56.419 --> 30:59.031
- I'm saying a cop who liked
to steal from homes

30:59.074 --> 31:02.077
was involved in a raid
where a very expensive gun

31:02.121 --> 31:03.644
was allegedly stolen.

31:03.687 --> 31:04.819
Nothing more.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.909
But it sure as hell
makes sense to me.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.519
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Yeah.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.480
- David Baker.

31:13.523 --> 31:16.875
- He doesn't live here anymore.

31:16.918 --> 31:17.876
- You know where he moved?

31:17.919 --> 31:19.312
- He didn't move.
He died.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.705
Two weeks ago.
Heart attack.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.098
- Anyone else
live in the apartment?

31:23.142 --> 31:24.360
Wife, girlfriend?

31:24.404 --> 31:25.753
- No, he was all alone.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.798
I tried to find family
to clean it out,

31:27.842 --> 31:28.974
but I came up empty.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.453
He had some nice things too.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.978
He had a flat-screen TV,
espresso machine,

31:33.021 --> 31:35.023
and lots of guns.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.938
- Mind if we go inside,
take a look?

31:36.982 --> 31:38.200
- There's nothing in there.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.593
I finally found someone
to take the stuff.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.073
- Who?

31:41.116 --> 31:42.988
- Lady who's been paying
his rent the last few months.

31:43.031 --> 31:43.989
- What's her name?

31:44.032 --> 31:45.120
- I don't know.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.469
I think she was a cop.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.603
Thin, blonde hair,
not too bad looking.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.997
She said she used to work
with Baker.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.259
- Hold on a second.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.265
- Yeah, that's her.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.885
- Thanks.
I just talked to Platt.

32:10.929 --> 32:11.973
She dug a little deeper
into Baker.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.148
She confirmed
that he and Brennan,

32:13.192 --> 32:14.758
they worked together,
they got close.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.935
They even dated for a while.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.240
She looks really good
for it, Sarge.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.763
- All right,
I'll take it from here.

32:19.807 --> 32:20.982
- What does that mean?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.724
- It means
I'll take it from here.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.035
- Hey.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.993
Everything okay?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.256
- I was hoping we could talk.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.518
- About what?

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
- You mind?

32:41.655 --> 32:43.787
- Can I get you a drink?

32:43.831 --> 32:45.441
- Uh, I'm good, thanks.

32:46.660 --> 32:50.142
- Okay, so what is it?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.187
Why are you here?

32:54.015 --> 32:57.018
- Came to talk about Kelton.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.020
- Not much to say, is there?

32:59.064 --> 33:00.065
He's dead.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.633
- You have a key to his house?

33:03.677 --> 33:04.591
- Excuse me?

33:04.634 --> 33:06.158
- A key.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.637
To his backdoor.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.162
- Hank, are you
suggesting that I--

33:10.205 --> 33:12.207
- I'm asking if you have a key.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.954
- Well, if you've come here
to accuse me of killing--

33:19.998 --> 33:21.869
- Look, I came here
as a friend.

33:25.568 --> 33:29.050
- I was at a dinner party
last night in Lincoln Park.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.357
You're welcome to call
the host, Ron Schwartz.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.881
- I already did.

33:33.924 --> 33:37.711
He said you left around 8:15...

33:37.754 --> 33:40.627
that you seemed preoccupied.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.672
- Oh, um...

33:42.716 --> 33:44.979
maybe he meant drunk.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.546
I had been out all day,

33:46.589 --> 33:48.374
so I didn't get a chance
to eat much.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.940
- Kate...

33:51.986 --> 33:53.901
Just tell me why you did it.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.297
Kelton renege on his deal?
- Don't do this, Hank.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.646
- When he threw you
under the bus

33:59.689 --> 34:00.908
for that serial killer thing,

34:00.951 --> 34:01.865
I imagine he offered you

34:01.909 --> 34:04.216
some kind of arrangement.

34:04.259 --> 34:07.349
Job, cash payment.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.093
What happened?

34:12.137 --> 34:15.444
Stop by one of his
victory parties...

34:15.488 --> 34:17.577
to remind him
that you sacrificed yourself

34:17.620 --> 34:20.797
in front of this entire city
so he could be mayor?

34:20.841 --> 34:23.017
- For God's sake.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.064
- He laughed at you, didn't he?

34:26.107 --> 34:28.631
Told you to get the hell out.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.155
Stay away from him.

34:33.027 --> 34:36.335
Your Irish blood,
it started to boil.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.338
Had a few drinks...

34:39.381 --> 34:42.384
and you grabbed Baker's gun
and you popped him.

34:46.432 --> 34:47.911
- If you're gonna
take me down for murder,

34:47.955 --> 34:50.000
you better have
more than a theory.

34:53.265 --> 34:54.962
- We've gone over
the footage three times.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.833
No sign of Brennan's SUV.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.401
Maybe she took the L
or grabbed a taxi.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.142
- But a car
would be a safer bet

35:01.186 --> 35:03.101
if you know where to park,
where to walk.

35:05.538 --> 35:08.062
And what to drive.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.020
Grab Baker's file.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.677
So if she cleaned out
his apartment,

35:14.721 --> 35:16.462
maybe she took his car too.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.028
- Oh, that's a good idea.

35:18.072 --> 35:21.423
Uh... gray Honda Accord, 2014.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.732
- There it is, it's two blocks
from Kelton's house.

35:25.775 --> 35:26.994
Gray Honda Accord.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.433
- Plates are a match.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.047
- We have evidence, Kate.

35:40.486 --> 35:43.445
That's you
in your friend's car.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.794
Two blocks
from the crime scene,

35:44.838 --> 35:46.970
five minutes after the murder.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.321
This is preposterous.

35:50.496 --> 35:54.064
- We also know
you used Baker's gun.

35:54.108 --> 35:57.024
Sig Sauer P210.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.770
- We both know
this city's better

36:03.813 --> 36:05.902
without that two-faced
son of a bitch.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.948
- There's no doubt about that.

36:12.039 --> 36:14.650
- He was gonna ruin Chicago.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.261
I did what I had to do.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.788
- What happens now, Hank?

36:35.889 --> 36:37.499
- He's leaving.

36:38.892 --> 36:40.415
And he's alone.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.114
He saw the photo
of Baker's car.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.377
He knows that Brennan was in it

36:45.420 --> 36:47.248
and that she had control
of the murder weapon.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.772
Why isn't he arresting her?

36:49.816 --> 36:51.383
- What do you think he's up to?

36:53.472 --> 36:56.126
- Maybe he's helping her
get rid of evidence,

36:56.170 --> 36:57.563
get out of the country.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.781
- Look, I don't know, but...

36:58.825 --> 37:00.609
Voight told you to stand down

37:00.653 --> 37:02.698
and that he's gonna handle it.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.613
- This is ridiculous.
I'm going in there.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.810
Do you want to cover the front?
I'm gonna go around back.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.073
- Yeah.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.561
- Backdoor's open.
I'm going in.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.910
- Copy.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.064
Ma'am, put the gun down.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.283
- Get out.
- Stop!

38:05.326 --> 38:07.937
Kate, stop, stop, stop.

38:07.981 --> 38:09.591
Please put it down.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.160
Please, please, put it down.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.729
Kate, Kate, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.905
Don't do this,
don't do this.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.341
Just put it down.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.215
It's over.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.478
Just come in with me,

38:26.521 --> 38:28.175
you tell your side
of the story.

38:29.655 --> 38:30.917
- Hey!

39:17.877 --> 39:21.010
- She's under arrest
for the murder of Brian Kelton.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.753
- Okay.
Let's get her processed.

39:24.797 --> 39:28.104
- Kate, Kate...

39:28.148 --> 39:29.410
you need me
to call you a lawyer?

39:29.454 --> 39:32.195
- You said you'd wait an hour.

39:32.239 --> 39:34.328
You lied to me, Hank.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.526
- How dare you?

40:00.920 --> 40:02.748
You went behind my back?

40:04.793 --> 40:06.665
- Sarge, I didn't know
what you were doing.

40:06.708 --> 40:07.796
I thought maybe--

40:07.840 --> 40:11.104
- Yeah, I know--
I know what you thought.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.715
You thought wrong, didn't you?

40:16.805 --> 40:19.199
I gave her a chance
to get her affairs in order,

40:19.242 --> 40:21.593
to do what she needed to do.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.466
I was setting up a containment.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.728
- Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

40:26.772 --> 40:29.949
- You didn't know
because you didn't ask!

40:29.992 --> 40:30.993
- I didn't ask you?

40:31.037 --> 40:32.168
- You didn't--
- I didn't--

40:32.212 --> 40:34.083
- I said I would handle it,
didn't I?

40:34.127 --> 40:35.650
Me!

40:35.694 --> 40:37.304
Not you!

40:39.132 --> 40:40.742
It was her choice, Jay.
You understand?

40:40.786 --> 40:42.657
Hers, not yours.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.096
She wants to put a bullet
under her chin in full blues,

40:47.140 --> 40:48.271
that's her right.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.448
It's her call.

40:53.929 --> 40:57.063
If you don't trust me, Jay...

40:57.106 --> 41:01.459
the way I do business
concerns you...

41:01.502 --> 41:03.199
then get the hell out.
