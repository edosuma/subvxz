00:07.800 --> 00:10.200
                    What are you
             doing, Cliff? What?

00:10.200 --> 00:12.200
Well, I'm, uh, leaving          
a tip there for Carla.          

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
                    Yeah?       

00:13.200 --> 00:15.000
Yeah, one of the oldest         
bar tricks                      

00:15.100 --> 00:16.100
in the book there, Normie.      

00:16.200 --> 00:18.700
Look, you see I filled          
the glass with water.           

00:18.800 --> 00:21.400
I'm gonna invert it on top      
of this dollar bill.            

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
Put it on the bar, right?       

00:23.400 --> 00:25.200
Looks... Looks, uh,             
empty now, doesn't it?          

00:25.300 --> 00:26.400
                         Mm-hmm.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.400
Well, watch what happens        
when she comes to get her tip.  

00:29.500 --> 00:32.100
     Fasten your seat belts     
 and wait for the fun to begin. 

00:33.400 --> 00:35.300
    Oh.                         

00:36.800 --> 00:39.000
Thanks for the tip, Cliff.      

00:46.000 --> 00:47.700
Uh, joke's still                
on her.                         

00:47.700 --> 00:50.500
She's the one that's got        
to mop up all this mess.        

00:50.600 --> 00:51.500
            (laughs)            

00:57.000 --> 00:58.100
Thank you, Carla.               

00:58.200 --> 01:00.100
Your apology's                  
accepted.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.900
        Hey, guys.              

02:15.900 --> 02:16.900
                      Hey, Wood.
            Hi, Wood.           

02:17.000 --> 02:17.900
      Mom finally sent out      

02:17.900 --> 02:19.700
 Grandma Meg's pressure cooker, 

02:19.700 --> 02:22.200
so last night I whipped up      
    a batch of chili.           

02:22.200 --> 02:23.700
                    Oh.         
    Do you want                 
    to try some?                

02:23.800 --> 02:24.900
            Yeah.               
Sure.                           

02:25.000 --> 02:26.200
    It's from an old            
    family recipe.              

02:26.300 --> 02:27.600
                    Oh, your    
                    grandma's?  

02:27.600 --> 02:29.800
      Nah, this old family      
that lived down the road.       

02:31.800 --> 02:33.300
    Mmm!                        

02:33.400 --> 02:34.500
         Woody, this is         
        excellent!              

02:34.500 --> 02:35.700
    Mmm!                        
                    Mmm!        

02:35.800 --> 02:37.000
                    Normie, what
                do you think?   

02:37.000 --> 02:37.600
                    (belches)   

02:38.600 --> 02:39.900
                    He likes it!

02:40.000 --> 02:42.900
                Normie likes it!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.800
Woody, I'm sorry. It seems      
we've eaten all your chili.     

02:44.900 --> 02:46.800
I still got plenty left         
in the thermos.                 
                          Great.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.700
 I didn't have breakfast today, 
        all right?              

02:54.800 --> 02:56.500
         (door opening)         

02:56.600 --> 02:59.300
         Quick, Normie,         
  turn on the Weather Channel.  

02:59.400 --> 03:00.200
              You know, I wonder

03:00.300 --> 03:02.600
            if that sentence has
        ever been spoken before.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.200
      (female voice on TV)      

03:05.300 --> 03:06.600
Oh, yeah, there she is.         

03:06.700 --> 03:07.800
    Who?                        

03:07.800 --> 03:09.300
      Weathergirl Dorothy,      
          my favorite.          

03:09.400 --> 03:11.700
    Isn't she dreamy?           

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
Cliff, everybody                
looks sort of dreamy            

03:13.800 --> 03:16.200
when they have giant clouds     
floating behind them.           

03:16.300 --> 03:17.600
            No, no.             
        Listen, listen.         

03:17.600 --> 03:20.100
      She's got the cutest      
      little lateral lisp.      

03:20.200 --> 03:22.100
Oh, I always get a giggle       
 when she tries to pronounce... 

03:22.100 --> 03:24.300
        (lisping):              
    ...stratocumulus.           

03:24.400 --> 03:27.000
So you, uh... you watch this    
a lot, do you?                  

03:27.000 --> 03:28.100
      Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.      

03:28.200 --> 03:30.200
          You get, uh,          
kind of a fatherly feeling      

03:30.300 --> 03:32.500
about these, uh, weather anchors
         after a while.         

03:32.600 --> 03:34.900
      Yeah, well, besides,      
    it's on all night.          

03:36.900 --> 03:39.500
            You're a very lonely
         man, aren't you, Cliff?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.800
          Not as long           
  as I got my Weather Channel.  

03:44.400 --> 03:46.200
        Hey, guys.              

03:46.300 --> 03:47.700
Hey, Sammy's back!              
    (all shouting greetings)    

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
                    Hey, how was
                    your weekend

03:49.100 --> 03:50.600
             up in the mountains
                with Natalie?   

03:50.700 --> 03:51.900
        It was so great.        

03:51.900 --> 03:53.900
Nothin' like shushing down      
    those fine white slopes.    

03:54.000 --> 03:55.100
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

03:55.100 --> 03:56.200
                    Oh, you went
                    skiing, huh?

03:56.300 --> 03:57.500
No, no, no.                     

03:57.600 --> 04:00.900
            You're a dog!       

04:01.000 --> 04:02.800
              Oh!               

04:02.900 --> 04:04.600
Goodie. Sam, you're back.       

04:04.600 --> 04:06.300
Hey, that's                     
what Natalie said.              

04:06.400 --> 04:07.600
No, actually,                   
actually, she said,             

04:07.700 --> 04:10.100
"Oh, goodie, Sam, your front."  

04:10.200 --> 04:11.300
        (laughter)              

04:11.400 --> 04:14.900
             I have a very, very
    special surprise for you,   

04:14.900 --> 04:18.000
              so just close your
          eyes and come with me.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.800
    This is deja vu of          
    the whole weekend.          

04:19.899 --> 04:21.000
FRASIER:                        
Oh!                             

04:24.700 --> 04:26.900
                Okay, you can   
                 open your eyes.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
        (chuckling):            
        Okay.                   

04:31.900 --> 04:33.800
             Well?              

04:33.800 --> 04:35.600
I can't tell you                

04:35.600 --> 04:39.100
how much better                 
Natalie's surprise was.         

04:39.200 --> 04:41.100
                    What, you   
                  don't like it?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.700
          Well, it...           
    It's-It's just...           

04:45.700 --> 04:47.000
                    Boy.        

04:47.000 --> 04:48.800
            I mean, it's-it's   
                    really...   

04:48.900 --> 04:50.400
                    Boy.        

04:50.500 --> 04:51.800
                No, that's...   
                that's not...   

04:51.900 --> 04:53.200
                  That's not the
                     right word.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.500
                        It's not
                     boy at all.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.000
             It's, um... It's...

04:56.100 --> 04:57.200
        It's a tearoom.         

04:57.200 --> 04:59.900
Thanks for not making me guess. 

05:00.000 --> 05:01.800
Well, so what-what do you think?

05:01.900 --> 05:04.400
     Well, you want my, uh,     
    honest first impression?    

05:04.500 --> 05:06.600
        My gut reaction?        

05:06.600 --> 05:07.200
        Yes, I do.              

05:07.300 --> 05:08.300
     I hate it. I hate it.      

05:08.400 --> 05:09.500
        I hate it!              

05:09.500 --> 05:11.100
            Now how could you   

05:11.200 --> 05:13.300
        do this without         
        asking me first?        

05:13.300 --> 05:14.900
Without asking you first?       

05:14.900 --> 05:17.700
Wait a minute! I happen to have 
paid $25,000 to John Hill       

05:17.700 --> 05:19.100
to get this poolroom back.      

05:19.200 --> 05:20.500
If it hadn't been for me,       

05:20.600 --> 05:22.100
you wouldn't even have          
this poolroom!                  

05:22.100 --> 05:23.200
    I don't have a poolroom.    

05:23.300 --> 05:24.500
    I have a tearoom.           

05:24.500 --> 05:25.700
              Ish!              

05:25.700 --> 05:27.900
          Oh, oh, oh.           

05:28.000 --> 05:29.400
                Look what you   
                     made me do.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.700
                     You made me
                      say "ish."

05:30.800 --> 05:32.200
                        (scoffs)

05:32.200 --> 05:34.800
What's that on the floor?       

05:34.900 --> 05:37.500
It's a throw rug.               

05:37.600 --> 05:38.700
              Oh.               

05:38.700 --> 05:40.200
                        Oh, hey.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.600
                Look at that.   
                    It works.   

05:41.700 --> 05:43.000
        Wait.                   

05:43.100 --> 05:45.700
         This wouldn't happen to
     be a throw table, would it?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.500
         No. Sam, wait!         

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
You know, if you're gonna       
take my money,                  

05:48.700 --> 05:52.100
I think my ideas deserve        
a little bit more respect.      

05:53.800 --> 05:55.400
                All right.      

05:55.500 --> 05:56.900
You're right.                   
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.           

05:57.000 --> 05:58.900
Uh, this just came              
as a little bit                 

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
of a shock to me,               
that's all.                     

06:00.900 --> 06:04.200
Tell you what, why don't I,     
uh, just, uh, go outside here   

06:04.300 --> 06:06.900
and come back in                
and start fresh?                

06:07.000 --> 06:08.900
    That would be good, Sam.    
        Thank you.              

06:10.800 --> 06:13.600
 I hate it. Hate it. <i>I hate it!</i> 

06:13.700 --> 06:15.600
              Ish!              

06:18.300 --> 06:20.800
        I'm putting that room   
            back the way it was!

06:20.900 --> 06:23.200
As soon as I find               
my pool table.                  

06:23.300 --> 06:25.600
                          CLIFF:
                     Three ball,
                  corner pocket.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.600
                    Thanks, Sam.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.700
            A little too much   
                English on that.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.300
                        REBECCA:
                            Sam,

06:34.400 --> 06:36.600
please, now I know... I know    
I sprung this on you, but       

06:36.700 --> 06:37.600
please give it a chance.        

06:37.700 --> 06:38.900
                      I think it
                     could work.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.100
My marketing survey showed      

06:40.100 --> 06:42.600
that this neighborhood was      
in need of something like this. 

06:42.600 --> 06:45.300
            People want to go   
                to a place where
            they can just relax.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
You know, a nice,               
quiet, pretty little place      

06:47.400 --> 06:49.200
where they can                  
just sit and talk.              

06:49.200 --> 06:50.500
                    (belches)   

06:52.500 --> 06:54.100
                Good one.       

06:57.300 --> 06:59.300
      Honey, you're crazy.      
 I-I have people coming in here 

06:59.400 --> 07:01.900
 just to shoot stick. I mean, I 
bet that poolroom makes me      

07:02.000 --> 07:04.100
        an extra hundred        
         bucks a night.         
                     Yeah, well,

07:04.200 --> 07:07.600
     I bet with my tearoom,     
I could make 500 bucks tonight. 

07:07.600 --> 07:09.400
        500 bucks               
         in one night?          
                            Yes.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.400
What else are you selling       
          back there?           

07:12.400 --> 07:14.700
     Sam, it's my grand opening.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
             I've been promoting
                  all over town.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.900
You make 500 bucks in one night,
 and-and that tearoom is yours. 

07:19.900 --> 07:21.100
          It's a bet.           

07:21.200 --> 07:22.300
            Okay, it's a bet.   
(chuckles)                      

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
          But I want you to know
          there's no losers here

07:24.500 --> 07:26.400
         because I'm gonna share
    half the profit with you.   

07:26.500 --> 07:28.000
          Oh ho! Ooh!           

07:28.000 --> 07:29.800
        Half the profits        
         of a tearoom!          

07:29.900 --> 07:31.200
              Oh!               

07:31.300 --> 07:34.100
            Oh, boy,            
 why didn't you say so before?  

07:34.100 --> 07:35.600
Let's figure                    
this out here.                  

07:35.700 --> 07:37.700
All right, let's see.           
We'll, uh,                      

07:37.800 --> 07:38.700
    start with your profits.    

07:38.700 --> 07:40.500
    That'd be... ooh!           

07:40.500 --> 07:42.800
Wait, wait, wait.               
Now I get half of this.         

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
          (muttering):          
         Let me. Hmm...         

07:43.900 --> 07:45.400
      Ooh, another... ooh!      

07:45.400 --> 07:47.000
     Fellas, fellas, look.      

07:47.100 --> 07:48.600
I get a great                   
big zero,                       

07:48.700 --> 07:50.300
and I don't have                
to lift a finger!               

07:50.300 --> 07:51.800
Oh, thank you,                  
thank you.                      

07:51.800 --> 07:54.200
              I can retire! Ooh!

07:57.600 --> 08:00.000
God, he's a butthead.           

08:06.200 --> 08:08.400
            DOROTHY:            
     Now, let's take a look     
      at the regional map.      

08:08.400 --> 08:10.900
        (lisping):              
      The southern sectors      
will experience scattered clouds

08:11.100 --> 08:13.000
  over the Mississippi Basin.   

08:13.100 --> 08:14.600
              Boy.              

08:14.600 --> 08:15.700
        (chuckles)              

08:15.800 --> 08:17.600
                  Don't you just
            love how she says   

08:17.600 --> 08:18.800
                      (lisping):
            "Mississippi Basin"?

08:18.900 --> 08:20.800
              It just melts your
         heart, doesn't it, huh?

08:20.800 --> 08:21.900
                  Mm-hmm.       

08:22.000 --> 08:24.600
        You know, I, uh,        
sent a fan letter to my Dorothy.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.900
                            Hmm?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.600
         Yeah, I wonder         
  if she'll ever even read it.  

08:27.700 --> 08:29.400
            I mean,             
  they must get so many. Hmm.   

08:29.500 --> 08:31.300
            You know, I don't   
                think so, Cliff.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.000
              I don't think that
            many people watch   
            the Weather Channel.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.400
                      Seriously,
                I don't think   

08:35.500 --> 08:37.600
        that many people know   
     there <i>is</i> a Weather Channel.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.600
        Hmm. Boy, Norm,         
     are you out of touch!      

08:43.000 --> 08:44.700
              Hey, Fras, Lilith.

08:44.700 --> 08:45.800
        Get you a drink?        

08:45.900 --> 08:48.300
        No, Sam, we are not here
          for libation this day.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.900
    We are here for the grand   
opening of Rebecca's tearoom.   

08:53.100 --> 08:54.400
                 Oh, yeah? Yeah?

08:54.500 --> 08:57.500
 What, you gonna go back there  
and, uh, make fun of her?       

08:59.100 --> 09:02.400
No, we're-we're going           
to go have some tea.            

09:02.400 --> 09:03.900
        Oh, yeah, yeah,         
     then you're, what...?      

09:04.000 --> 09:07.200
      You're gonna spit it      
 on the floor and laugh at her? 

09:07.200 --> 09:11.300
We're just going to order it    
and drink it down.              

09:11.400 --> 09:14.000
 Well, what's funny about that? 

09:14.100 --> 09:15.900
We're not trying                
to be funny.                    

09:15.900 --> 09:18.100
We're just here for some tea.   

09:18.200 --> 09:19.800
Is that so hard to believe?     

09:19.900 --> 09:21.800
        Yeah, seein' how        
    she's been open all day,    

09:21.900 --> 09:23.200
and you're the first customers. 
        (chuckles)              

09:23.300 --> 09:26.600
        Oh, well, maybe the word
          hasn't gotten out yet.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.100
          Although, she did send
    us this lovely invitation   

09:30.100 --> 09:32.600
            hand-calligraphed   
                on a lace doily.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.600
              Didn't anyone else
            get one of these?   

09:38.000 --> 09:39.800
                     Very funny.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.500
        Could have put someone's
              eye out, you know.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.600
              Let's go, Frasier.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.000
Wait, wait,                     
wait, Fras.                     

09:49.000 --> 09:50.800
You're not really               
gonna go in there               

09:50.900 --> 09:52.400
and drink tea,                  
are ya?                         

09:52.400 --> 09:54.800
Come on out here                
and sit at the bar,             

09:54.900 --> 09:57.800
you know,                       
with the guys.                  

09:57.900 --> 09:59.800
Have a beer.                    
            Yeah.               

10:02.800 --> 10:04.300
Well, I guess I-I could.        

10:04.400 --> 10:05.700
                 (clears throat)

10:05.800 --> 10:06.900
              No.               

10:09.100 --> 10:11.500
I mean, you're-you're tellin' us
you're just gonna go back there 

10:11.600 --> 10:14.300
     and sit with your wife     
    and sip tea, huh?           

10:14.300 --> 10:16.500
        Yup, that's me.         

10:16.500 --> 10:19.200
Whipped and proud of it.        

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
Thank you.                      

10:24.700 --> 10:25.800
         Here you are.          

10:25.900 --> 10:27.800
        Please allow me.        

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
    All right, there.           

10:32.400 --> 10:34.000
 Now you'll notice on the menu  

10:34.100 --> 10:36.700
    that we have a...           
 a wide selection of sandwiches 

10:36.700 --> 10:41.300
    and delectables, and, uh,   
many, many varieties of tea.    

10:41.400 --> 10:43.100
    So, what can I get you?     

10:43.200 --> 10:45.400
     Just some tea, please.     

10:46.400 --> 10:49.200
      That's it? Just tea?      

10:49.400 --> 10:51.500
         Well, perhaps          
    I could tempt you           

10:51.600 --> 10:53.700
         with some tiny         
      little sandwiches or      

10:53.800 --> 10:55.600
        fresh biscuits?         

10:56.900 --> 10:59.600
            Scones?             

10:59.700 --> 11:01.600
 We're both watching our diets, 

11:01.600 --> 11:04.400
  so two pots of Orange Pekoe   
        would be lovely.        

11:04.500 --> 11:05.600
FRASIER:                        
Hon,                            

11:05.600 --> 11:06.700
  maybe we should split a pot.  

11:07.600 --> 11:09.300
            Well...             

11:09.400 --> 11:12.700
 Per-Perhaps one of my slightly 
  more expensive herbal teas?   

11:12.800 --> 11:14.200
Uh, no, thank you.              

11:14.300 --> 11:17.100
 You guys cannot just have tea. 

11:17.100 --> 11:18.300
                        Tea is a
                    loss leader.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.500
          I lose money          
    just boiling the water.     

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
    And, Lilith, look.          

11:23.000 --> 11:24.100
      (blows through lips)      

11:24.200 --> 11:25.300
      You are hardly fat.       

11:25.400 --> 11:27.800
  You are borderline anorexic.  

11:27.800 --> 11:29.600
Just                            

11:29.600 --> 11:30.400
            pig out!            

11:30.500 --> 11:31.900
  Order some strawberry tarts.  

11:31.900 --> 11:33.600
Strawberries make me break out. 

11:33.700 --> 11:36.400
  Well, at least that will put  
  a little color in your face.  

11:38.700 --> 11:40.800
        Perhaps we won't have   
                anything at all.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.000
             Fine!              

11:42.100 --> 11:44.000
 I don't really care. Get out!  

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
              Thanks for coming.
          Tell all your friends.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.400
                Frasier, Lilith,
                  oh, I'm sorry.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.400
                  I'm sorry. I'm
                 just desperate.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.200
    I don't understand          
        why nobody wants        

11:58.300 --> 12:00.100
            to come back into my
              beautiful tearoom.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.100
Well, Rebecca,                  

12:02.200 --> 12:05.100
a restaurant should be...       

12:05.200 --> 12:07.100
like a mistress.                

12:07.200 --> 12:09.200
You see,                        

12:09.200 --> 12:13.200
one shouldn't feel that         
she's overeager to please.      

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
It's far more enticing          

12:14.900 --> 12:16.800
if you need her more            
than she needs you.             

12:20.000 --> 12:21.600
            Who is this "she"   

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
                  you're talking
                 about, Frasier?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
Purely hypothetical.            

12:25.600 --> 12:26.900
                    Well, it's a
                  little strange

12:27.000 --> 12:28.700
                for a happily   
                     married man

12:28.800 --> 12:30.500
              to go prattling on
            about a mistress.   

12:30.600 --> 12:32.000
Oh, come on, hon,               
give me this one.               

12:32.100 --> 12:33.500
You already heard me            
admit I was whipped             

12:33.500 --> 12:34.700
in front of the boys.           

12:34.800 --> 12:36.400
             That was good.     

12:40.300 --> 12:41.900
You were right, Sam.            

12:41.900 --> 12:43.200
Nobody's gonna come             
in here                         

12:43.200 --> 12:45.100
and have high tea               
and crumpets.                   

12:45.200 --> 12:46.500
                  Oh, don't give
                        up hope.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.800
(Cockney accent):               
Maybe a carriage                
will break down                 

12:48.900 --> 12:51.700
in front of the pub             
and everyone'll come            
in for a cup of tea.            

12:51.800 --> 12:53.100
Have a cup of                   
tea, please.                    

12:53.100 --> 12:55.100
Have a cup of tea.              
                God, I hate you!

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
          Okay, guys.           

13:01.000 --> 13:04.100
 Just made up a fresh new batch 
        of chili.               

13:04.200 --> 13:06.100
(cheering)                      

13:06.200 --> 13:07.800
                Now all I ask   

13:07.800 --> 13:09.500
         is you please          
    leave me some this time.    

13:12.400 --> 13:15.300
            You guys really like
          that chili, don't you?
  Mmm.                          

13:15.400 --> 13:16.800
                    Well, do you
                      think that

13:16.800 --> 13:20.000
          if I sold that kind of
    chili in my tearoom that,   

13:20.100 --> 13:21.700
                uh, I could make
                $500 a night?   

13:21.700 --> 13:22.400
Easy. But, uh,                  

13:22.600 --> 13:24.000
why would anyone want           
to go back there?               

13:24.000 --> 13:26.500
We got a free pot               
of chili right here.            

13:26.500 --> 13:27.700
                Good point.     

13:29.000 --> 13:29.800
     Chili in the tearoom!      

13:30.000 --> 13:32.300
        Chili in the tearoom!   

13:33.800 --> 13:36.200
Sammy, kiss that poolroom       
         good-bye, pal.         

13:48.300 --> 13:50.700
Sam, she's sellin' an awful     
lotta chili in there.           

13:50.800 --> 13:52.400
She must be gettin'             
pretty close                    

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
to that $500 mark.              
                    Oh, come on.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.900
              So she's sellin' a
                couple of bowls.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.900
          I mean, how much chili
                  can a guy eat?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.100
    Boy, I can't eat another    
        mouthful.               

14:00.200 --> 14:01.000
                     Uh-huh, see
                    what I mean?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.700
Thank goodness they sell        
these gallon buckets            

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
    for take-out.               

14:05.800 --> 14:07.600
            Oh, man,            

14:07.700 --> 14:08.900
                  I'm gonna lose
                    my poolroom.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.800
        I've gotta think of some
                way to stop her.

14:10.900 --> 14:11.900
I agree with you,               
Sammy.                          

14:11.900 --> 14:13.000
Go for the jugular.             

14:13.100 --> 14:13.900
                 Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.300
            Whatta ya mean, like
                sabotage her?   

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
No, go for her jugular.         

14:18.300 --> 14:20.600
I mean, you can't               
sell chili                      

14:20.600 --> 14:22.700
when her throat's               
all ripped out.                 

14:22.800 --> 14:25.700
Well, she could,                
but who'd wanna buy it?         

14:26.800 --> 14:28.700
                No, I got it,   
                    I got it.   

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
             Let's call the fire
            marshal on her, huh?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
                 No, no, no, no,
                     no, no, no,

14:32.800 --> 14:34.100
                 that'd be below
                    the belt.   

14:34.200 --> 14:35.600
                I can't do that.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.400
Sam, can I talk to you a minute?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.700
                     You know, I
                just realized   

14:39.800 --> 14:41.700
             that the closer I'm
             getting to my goal,

14:41.800 --> 14:43.700
    the more all I'm thinking   
            about is winning,   

14:43.800 --> 14:45.100
        and that's not right.   

14:45.100 --> 14:46.800
        I mean, I wasn't even   
      considering your feelings.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.000
        You've had that poolroom
            for many, many years

14:49.100 --> 14:51.200
         and, well, I guess what
         I'm trying to say is...

14:51.300 --> 14:53.500
          (singsongy):          
      Ha-ha-ha-ha, <i>ha-ha!</i>       

14:53.500 --> 14:57.900
                I'm gonna win   
                  your poolroom!

15:01.300 --> 15:02.900
     Call the fire marshal!     

15:08.800 --> 15:11.000
 Glad that dinner rush is over. 

15:11.000 --> 15:13.300
                 Give me time to
                put up a new pot

15:13.400 --> 15:15.700
        before the after-theatre
                crowd gets here.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.800
                 Sam, I'm takin'
                        a break.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.000
Me, too, Sammy.                 

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm down to the last notch      
on my belt.                     

15:21.100 --> 15:23.500
        Yeah, I had to make a   
            new one with a nail.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.600
 Hey, Cliff, you got somethin'  
          in the mail.          

15:27.600 --> 15:29.300
    Huh?                        
That reminds me.                

15:29.400 --> 15:30.800
  Did I ever take you out back  

15:30.900 --> 15:33.100
  and kick the hell out of you  
for that postal increase?       

15:33.200 --> 15:34.400
    Uh-huh.                     

15:34.500 --> 15:35.200
             Good.              

15:35.300 --> 15:37.100
 Just goin' over my checklist.  

15:37.100 --> 15:39.300
        Well, look at this!     

15:39.400 --> 15:42.900
        It's a reply from my    
        Weathergirl Dorothy.    

15:43.000 --> 15:45.200
Oh, look at that,               
the sweetheart.                 

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
She sent a little photo         
of herself.                     

15:46.900 --> 15:48.300
            No, no, no, Cliffie,

15:48.300 --> 15:49.600
                I believe that's
            a satellite photo   

15:49.700 --> 15:52.600
                of the entire   
            Eastern Seaboard.   

15:52.700 --> 15:54.600
Oh, yeah,                       
but she's in there.             

15:54.700 --> 15:56.600
I mean, I'm in there.           

15:56.700 --> 15:59.200
We're all in there.             

15:59.200 --> 16:01.500
                The letter says,
                    "Dear Cliff,

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
          "Thank you so much for
              your sweet letter.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.200
            "You did not mention
        what grade you're in,   

16:05.200 --> 16:06.600
    "but from the handwriting   
                         I guess

16:06.600 --> 16:10.100
              "that you're a big
                boy of 11 or 12.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.100
                 "Maybe when you
                        grow up,

16:12.100 --> 16:13.500
                "you can be a   
             weatherperson, too.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.300
                    Yours truly,
                Dorothy Borsik."

16:17.700 --> 16:19.500
            CARLA (whispers):   
                      Sammy, the
                fire marshal.   

16:19.600 --> 16:20.900
Sam,                            

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
        we got a tip that Cheers
          is operating a kitchen

16:23.100 --> 16:24.700
            without a permit.   

16:24.800 --> 16:26.700
            Anything to that?   

16:26.800 --> 16:28.400
          Oh, gosh no.          

16:28.500 --> 16:30.500
  I don't think anything that   
  would concern you, you know,  

16:30.500 --> 16:33.000
         just a couple          
of exposed propane tanks,       

16:33.100 --> 16:34.700
                    unventilated
                      hot plate.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.600
      I mean, but that...       
     oh, now wait a second.     

16:36.700 --> 16:39.600
         Gee, that's a,         
that's a potential fire hazard. 

16:39.700 --> 16:41.600
And you, you're a fire marshal. 

16:41.700 --> 16:43.200
      What was I thinking?      

16:44.700 --> 16:46.800
            I think I'll just   
                take a look-see.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.900
Maybe I shouldn't have called   
            the fire department.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.200
        Maybe that was wrong.   

16:54.300 --> 16:55.700
Don't chicken out               
now, Sam.                       

16:55.800 --> 16:57.500
                     No, no, no,
              maybe I shoulda...

16:57.500 --> 16:59.800
              put a mouse in the
            chili and called the
              health department.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.200
                 That would have
                been funnier.   

17:01.300 --> 17:03.300
        (laughing)              

17:03.400 --> 17:04.599
              Sam,              

17:04.700 --> 17:05.700
you should                      

17:05.700 --> 17:06.900
    be ashamed of yourself.     

17:07.000 --> 17:08.400
Do you realize                  

17:08.500 --> 17:10.200
  everything that Rebecca has   
     attempted in her life      

17:10.300 --> 17:12.000
    has resulted in failure?    

17:12.000 --> 17:12.700
             Yeah.              

17:12.900 --> 17:14.200
This is her first               

17:14.300 --> 17:16.700
success, and you're trying      
to take it away from her.       

17:16.800 --> 17:18.200
      That's my poolroom!       

17:18.200 --> 17:19.400
    But it's her life.          

17:19.400 --> 17:20.599
     But it's my poolroom.      

17:22.099 --> 17:24.000
 Come on, you guys, understand  
        that, don't ya?         

17:24.099 --> 17:26.000
                Yeah, Sam, we   
                     understand.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.600
We understand you made a fair   
        bet, you saw that you   

17:28.700 --> 17:30.300
                were gonna lose,
    and you started cheatin'.   

17:31.700 --> 17:33.700
Well, I-I-I didn't want         
to be a bad sport.              

17:33.800 --> 17:37.600
I just wanted to do anything    
I had to to win.                

17:37.700 --> 17:40.600
But that's no reason            
for you to be a cheater.        

17:40.700 --> 17:42.800
            But you were the one
        who told me to cheat!   

17:42.900 --> 17:45.000
No, I said                      
to kill her.                    

17:47.800 --> 17:49.500
Cheating's wrong.               

17:51.300 --> 17:52.500
        I'm, I'm sorry.         

17:52.600 --> 17:54.700
 What, do you all hate me now?  
          Is that...?           

17:54.700 --> 17:56.500
    Well, kinda, yeah.          

17:58.500 --> 18:00.800
          I'm afraid that's some
                list, Miss Howe.

18:00.900 --> 18:01.900
                        NORM:   
                          Great,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.600
    now he's writin' her up     
          a citation.           

18:03.600 --> 18:06.400
                  So it's beans,
                tomato paste,   

18:06.500 --> 18:09.200
                 onions, peppers
                and ground beef.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.900
No, that's ground chuck.        

18:10.900 --> 18:13.900
            Oh, ground chuck.   

18:16.600 --> 18:17.800
                Serves eight?   
Uh-huh.                         

18:17.800 --> 18:19.900
What're you gonna do,           
share with the other guys       

18:20.000 --> 18:21.500
at the firehouse?               
                Why should I?   

18:21.600 --> 18:23.500
             What have they ever
                    done for me?

18:25.300 --> 18:26.900
        Sam,                    

18:26.900 --> 18:28.500
why do you suppose              

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
          the fire marshal would
        come by my chili room   

18:30.500 --> 18:32.200
                     tonight, of
                     all nights?

18:32.300 --> 18:35.500
            Kismet?             

18:35.600 --> 18:37.800
                 No, because you
                 tipped him off.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.100
Sam, you could've               
gotten me shut down.            

18:40.100 --> 18:43.800
             Thank God that dear
            man loves his chili.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
        I'm sorry.              

18:44.900 --> 18:46.100
             I got carried away.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.300
            Yes, you did.       

18:47.400 --> 18:49.300
              Listen, I, I gotta
            make this up to you.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.800
              How, how, how, how
                close are you   

18:51.900 --> 18:53.600
        to getting that $500?   

18:53.600 --> 18:54.700
                      About $20.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.600
             I'll tell you what.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.800
             Let me, let me, uh,

18:56.900 --> 18:59.500
                buy a bowl of   
                  chili for $20.
No.                             

18:59.500 --> 19:01.000
              No, Sam, you don't
                need to do that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
No, listen, I wanna prove to you
that I'm not a poor loser.      

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
                Come on, give me

19:04.200 --> 19:04.800
     my bowl of chili here.     

19:05.000 --> 19:07.300
        Thank you, Sam,         
      this is nice of you.      

19:07.300 --> 19:09.500
Go ahead,                       
just put on Woody's hat         

19:09.600 --> 19:10.700
and get the chili yourself      

19:10.800 --> 19:12.700
because I want to get           
my camera and get a picture     

19:12.700 --> 19:14.000
of you pouring                  
that bowl                       

19:14.100 --> 19:15.600
      of chili that put me      
         over the top.          

19:15.700 --> 19:17.100
Oh, you got                     
to warm it up, Sam.             

19:17.200 --> 19:18.800
You know how to                 
turn on the flame?              

19:18.800 --> 19:19.800
It's kind of tricky.            

19:19.800 --> 19:21.600
                      Yeah, I'll
                  figure it out.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.000
                (loud explosion)

19:27.100 --> 19:30.100
            Yep, that's how I   
            figured it out, too.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.300
    It was a accident.          

19:46.500 --> 19:49.300
Sammy, are you okay?            

19:49.300 --> 19:52.300
You ever had a pot of chili fly 
          by your face          

19:52.300 --> 19:54.000
     at the speed of light?     

19:54.000 --> 19:55.200
        No.                     

19:55.300 --> 19:57.400
             Don't.             

19:57.500 --> 20:00.300
                Look at the hole
                in that wall.   

20:00.400 --> 20:01.800
      Who could miss it, huh?   

20:01.800 --> 20:03.000
No, I'm talking                 
about the brick wall            

20:03.100 --> 20:05.600
            across the alley.   

20:05.700 --> 20:07.900
    Man, that pressure cooker   
      really wanted out of here.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.900
Okay, everybody                 
out of here, out.               

20:11.000 --> 20:13.400
Come on,                        
everybody, out!                 

20:13.400 --> 20:14.900
Go back to the bar,             
please.                         

20:14.900 --> 20:17.200
            Not you.            

20:17.300 --> 20:19.700
I want to talk to you.          

20:19.700 --> 20:24.500
  Don't you think maybe I should
    go to a trauma center first?

20:24.600 --> 20:27.000
                  S-Some of this
                    could be me.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.800
        Oh, come on, I know what
        you're thinking here,   

20:31.900 --> 20:33.800
    but I-I didn't do           
        this on purpose.        

20:33.900 --> 20:36.700
    I swear to God I didn't     
    do it on purpose.           

20:36.700 --> 20:38.200
    You did it just because     
  I started doing really well   

20:38.300 --> 20:39.300
 back here and you're jealous.  

20:39.300 --> 20:41.200
Y-You're just a big baby.       

20:41.300 --> 20:43.000
        I am not.               
                Yes, you are.   

20:43.100 --> 20:45.500
  You want everything for you   
      and nothing for me.       

20:45.500 --> 20:48.400
  Well, yeah, if that's being   
    a big baby, okay,           

20:48.500 --> 20:50.300
    but... but I'm a,           

20:50.400 --> 20:51.100
I'm a guy.                      

20:51.200 --> 20:53.500
I'm supposed                    
to be a big baby.               

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
      And you're a woman.       

20:54.700 --> 20:56.700
You know, you're supposed       
to be like a nice mommy         

20:56.800 --> 21:00.200
and tell me everything's okay   
and, and pat me on the head.    

21:00.300 --> 21:04.900
         I would like to pat you
      on the head with a pickax.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.300
Oh, I, I know how you feel.     

21:06.400 --> 21:07.300
            I mean,             

21:07.400 --> 21:08.300
I'm sorry.                      

21:08.400 --> 21:10.100
             This is crazy, I...

21:10.200 --> 21:12.300
        I feel so sorry.        

21:12.400 --> 21:13.800
         No, you don't.         

21:13.800 --> 21:15.200
    Yes, I do, I really do.     

21:15.200 --> 21:16.300
     I just feel terrible.      

21:16.400 --> 21:19.700
  I... feel like I could cry.   

21:19.700 --> 21:22.600
             Okay.              

21:22.600 --> 21:24.000
        Okay what?              

21:25.500 --> 21:26.800
                Cry.            

21:27.000 --> 21:29.100
What do you mean?               

21:29.200 --> 21:31.800
    I mean, make water come     
    out of your eyes.           

21:33.600 --> 21:35.200
    And that way I will know    
that you are really sorry       

21:35.300 --> 21:37.200
for what you've done here.      

21:38.100 --> 21:40.900
         Just cry?              

21:40.900 --> 21:41.600
                Yep.            

21:55.000 --> 21:56.200
Does it count if, you know,     

21:56.300 --> 21:58.400
if you really want to cry,      
but you can't?                  

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
                 No.            

21:59.500 --> 22:00.800
              Cry, Sam.         

22:00.900 --> 22:01.900
        Huh.                    

22:01.900 --> 22:04.900
(mock sobbing)                  

22:06.000 --> 22:08.300
                      No onions.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.000
        I want real tears.      
             Now, just cry.     

22:11.100 --> 22:12.800
Give me a break.                
What am I supposed to--?        

22:12.900 --> 22:13.900
      I mean, isn't this enough?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.300
                    A guy, a guy
                  who can't cry?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.700
                 I mean, that is
                  heartbreaking.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.100
Honey, there's nothing sadder   
than a man who can't cry.       

22:21.200 --> 22:22.500
                        No, Sam.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.700
         It is not enough.      

22:25.100 --> 22:28.500
            Wait, maybe I can   
              help you out here.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.100
                (glass breaking)

22:39.200 --> 22:40.400
                      (footsteps
                    approaching)

22:40.400 --> 22:42.200
             There.             

22:42.300 --> 22:43.800
         Now we can go.         

22:43.800 --> 22:46.100
            Come on.            

22:46.200 --> 22:47.100
            What was that sound?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.300
Oh, that was the sound          

22:48.400 --> 22:50.700
of me breaking all the windows  
out of your Corvette.           

22:50.800 --> 22:52.500
         (Sam sobbing)          

22:52.600 --> 22:55.200
REBECCA:                        
There, now there                
are those tears.
