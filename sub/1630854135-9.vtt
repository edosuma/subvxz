00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.846
<i>Pearl gave us a thumb drive
that has the potential</i>

00:20.846 --> 00:22.065
<i>to bury the Silas family.</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:25.025
48 hours later,
she's in a coma.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.940
Teddy, drop the bat.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.117
He tried to kill my wife.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.292
<i>Your father was
the one who paid</i>

00:31.292 --> 00:32.510
<i>to have your wife murdered.</i>

00:32.510 --> 00:35.339
He's fled.
Any idea where he might go?

00:35.339 --> 00:37.211
You're closing
the OC task force.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.603
You do know what
a big deal this is?

00:38.603 --> 00:41.171
You have a new desk
waiting for you at 1PP.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.346
This task force
was started because

00:42.346 --> 00:43.739
of what happened to my wife.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.176
<i>My heart and soul
are in this place.</i>

00:46.176 --> 00:47.395
You knew that.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.744
Maybe you're just pissed

00:48.744 --> 00:50.572
because I didn't ask
for your permission.

00:50.572 --> 00:54.402
You're the boss, so it's
your prerogative, right?

00:59.102 --> 01:02.149
Oh, sorry.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.585
What gives?

01:03.585 --> 01:06.196
New landlords are gonna
change things up, I guess.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.676
Excuse me.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.070
What exactly are you
planning to do here?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.636
Just taking
measurements for now.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.074
Probably gonna
make it more corporate.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.815
Oh, you did not.

01:16.815 --> 01:17.903
Merry Christmas.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.210
It's, like, three weeks away.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.082
It's never too early
to be in the spirit.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.130
Sarge.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.697
Yeah?

01:28.697 --> 01:31.091
I know it's early,
but I've always been that guy

01:31.091 --> 01:32.744
to get ahead of the rush.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.269
And since we're officially
done before the holidays.

01:37.923 --> 01:38.837
Open it.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.409
Sage.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.281
To cleanse your new office.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.848
You know where it is yet?

01:49.848 --> 01:51.633
No, no, not yet.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.420
Hey, Elliot.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.861
- Leaving this on your desk.
- Ah.

02:02.861 --> 02:03.819
Thanks, man.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.650
You didn't text me back
last night.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.132
I need time
to think about it.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.961
Okay.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.225
Well, once you get a sense,
you know, let me know.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.968
I can help assign you
to whatever unit you want.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.840
You need my input?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.669
I'm trying to help you.

02:27.669 --> 02:28.974
Well, I'm good.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.889
I'm good.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.717
You're just gonna
do it your way, right?

02:34.371 --> 02:36.634
Well, seeing as
it's served me all these years,

02:36.634 --> 02:38.462
yeah, I guess I'll just
do it my way.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.638
Yeah, and Lord knows
you went behind my back

02:40.638 --> 02:43.163
every chance you got
while you were here.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.382
So you know what?
Do you, Elliot.

02:45.382 --> 02:48.080
I've always done
everything for this unit,

02:48.080 --> 02:49.473
for the good of this unit.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.301
I never abandoned it.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.781
Abandoned it?

02:54.609 --> 02:57.699
I'm doing this for my family.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.354
I would think you of all people
would understand that.

03:00.354 --> 03:04.662
Yeah, well,
we're also your family.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.971
Merry Christmas, everyone.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.451
Excuse me.

03:10.451 --> 03:13.105
I'm looking for Sergeant Bell
and Detective Stabler.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.194
They're in a meeting
right now.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.238
Can I help you?

03:15.238 --> 03:17.240
I'm Robert Silas's attorney.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.460
I'm here to negotiate
for his surrender.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.508
So what kind of cooperation
deal are we talking about?

03:24.508 --> 03:26.510
Robert's son
is in custody right now.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.512
In exchange
for Robert's surrender,

03:28.512 --> 03:30.122
he would like Teddy
released from jail

03:30.122 --> 03:31.341
and all charges dropped.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.082
He nearly beat
a man to death.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.257
Think again.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.998
The man was
a known mob enforcer

03:35.998 --> 03:39.131
who Teddy is claiming
attacked him first.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.220
I think that's self-defense.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.093
What are you offering?

03:44.093 --> 03:46.965
This is a list of names
from the Russo crime family

03:46.965 --> 03:48.271
you're going to recognize.

03:48.271 --> 03:51.883
If we can come to terms,

03:51.883 --> 03:54.538
Robert will offer his full
cooperation on what he knows

03:54.538 --> 03:55.757
regarding their
business dealings,

03:55.757 --> 03:58.107
as well as their
other enterprises.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.370
Robert tells me there are
recorded conversations

04:00.370 --> 04:02.546
to back up his claims
of illegal activity.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.722
So why would we trust
what he has to say?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.463
You don't have to believe
anything right now.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.726
Just give him
a chance to speak.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.902
And he promises
full cooperation?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.034
Mm-hmm.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.517
All right.
I'll be right back.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.784
Robert Silas has been

04:22.784 --> 04:28.006
the most morally corrupt human
being since before I was born.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.531
Tried to have his
daughter-in-law killed,

04:30.531 --> 04:32.402
but all of a sudden,
he wants to do the right thing.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.318
What happened?

04:35.318 --> 04:36.928
He get visited by the Ghost
of Christmas Future?

04:36.928 --> 04:39.279
I'm not here to discuss
motive, Detective.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.889
Only to make a deal.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.718
Well, you ask anyone
in the city

04:43.718 --> 04:47.504
who's made a deal with a Silas,
and they'll tell you,

04:47.504 --> 04:49.898
it doesn't work out
the way they wanted it to.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.161
Okay.
The DA's willing to talk.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.598
But Teddy's still looking
at five years, minimum.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.208
Well, I know that,
and you know that,

04:56.208 --> 04:58.646
but my client won't accept it
until he hears it from you.

04:58.646 --> 05:02.127
Wouldn't be the first
bad guy we had to educate.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.955
All right,
we need a proffer agreement

05:03.955 --> 05:06.306
and a full debriefing
so we can understand

05:06.306 --> 05:08.220
what the deal looks like.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.831
How do we arrange that?

05:09.831 --> 05:12.312
Robert is prepared to have
a preliminary conversation

05:12.312 --> 05:14.139
in a neutral location
to hear you out.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.837
Where?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.926
Um, one second.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.627
Okay.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.629
Uh, yeah. I'll call you back.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.634
So they want another squad
to run point on this.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.723
No.
The Silas family's an OC case.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.464
Yeah, but OC
is shutting down.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.118
In a week.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.599
Look, Robert reached out
to us for a reason.

05:38.599 --> 05:39.861
If we don't follow through
on this,

05:39.861 --> 05:41.602
he's not gonna
trust anybody else.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.474
And Teddy called me
when Pearl was in trouble.

05:44.474 --> 05:48.565
Ayanna, it'll be our last case.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.092
Ayanna?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.403
All right.
Find the location.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.013
I'll deal with the DA.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.451
Sarge, thanks.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.414
Mark, it's Ayanna Bell again.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.850
OC.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.026
Yeah, uh, OC is gonna
run point on this,

06:15.026 --> 06:16.724
or there will be no deal.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.792
I didn't check in
with you first because...

07:26.141 --> 07:28.143
I was trying to process it
on my own.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.277
And I was hoping this job
was gonna give me

07:32.277 --> 07:36.281
more normal hours so I could
fight this custody thing.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.587
But Denise...

07:39.067 --> 07:40.634
I understand that.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.159
I don't even know
if I really want

07:44.159 --> 07:48.076
this new job, to be honest.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.040
It's just--

07:56.040 --> 07:58.521
you know,
everything's been out of whack

07:58.521 --> 08:00.567
since Denise and I separated.

08:03.657 --> 08:07.138
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

08:07.138 --> 08:10.794
You know, I used
to have this family

08:10.794 --> 08:13.928
to go home to, and...

08:13.928 --> 08:17.584
And now, uh--

08:17.584 --> 08:20.151
yeah, I'm just all alone
at the end of the day.

08:20.151 --> 08:24.068
It's strange.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.853
Well, I get that.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.510
The apartment is so empty
since Eli's been gone.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.076
You know, my mother's.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.692
And since Kathy...

08:40.476 --> 08:43.218
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

08:46.264 --> 08:49.093
Really?
Well, where the hell are we?

09:07.372 --> 09:08.722
I'll text the lawyer.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.638
Hey, you getting any signal?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.686
Yeah, I got, uh one--no.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.123
I don't have any.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.212
Okay.
Oh wait, I got one.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.736
Hold on.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.304
This looks abandoned.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.350
Yeah, I think this is
one of his properties.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.615
Okay, she responded.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.661
Red door.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.228
Go to the third floor.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.891
<i>Take the staircase
in front of you.</i>

09:49.676 --> 09:51.721
Mr. Silas?

09:51.721 --> 09:53.549
<i>Just follow the music.</i>

10:18.530 --> 10:20.358
Mr. Silas?

10:47.864 --> 10:50.693
Detective Stabler.
Sergeant Bell.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.742
I noticed there wasn't a DA
with you when you got here.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.482
They're on standby.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.876
Once we understand what
you're willing to share,

10:59.876 --> 11:01.051
I'll call them.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.794
Right to brass tacks.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.231
How I like to do
business as well.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.671
Years ago, I started making
notes on all my deals.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.499
Names, places, photos.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.327
Even got in the habit...

11:18.416 --> 11:20.592
Of recording conversations.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.333
Must have sat in 1,000 rooms

11:22.333 --> 11:25.946
and took money,
bribes, kickbacks.

11:25.946 --> 11:29.166
Paid for problems to disappear
if that didn't work.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.126
If they did business
with me, they're in one

11:32.126 --> 11:33.954
of these cabinets somewhere.

11:33.954 --> 11:37.000
And I'm willing to talk
you through all of it,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.742
as long as Teddy
gets out of jail.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.005
Well, attempted murder
doesn't get a free pass.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.400
Yeah, I know
how proffers work.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.751
Just like I know that

11:48.751 --> 11:52.059
anything can be arranged
for the right price.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.887
Your daughter-in-law,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.063
the one you tried
to have murdered,

11:56.063 --> 11:57.760
she gave us
a whole bunch of intel.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.414
Same stuff you're selling.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.026
I know exactly
what she gave you.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.246
I knew the second she stole it,

12:05.246 --> 12:08.510
and it's nothing
compared to what I'm offering.

12:08.510 --> 12:13.167
And you don't have time
to waste figuring that out.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.908
Ever seen one of these before?

12:16.083 --> 12:21.175
This here is my brain,
and, uh, this...

12:21.175 --> 12:23.481
isn't supposed to be there.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.441
I thought the headaches
were just stress.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.313
Evidently, I was supposed
to drop dead a year ago.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.624
So who knows how
long I have now?

12:35.624 --> 12:37.104
It's your call.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.803
I read somewhere
that classical music

12:40.803 --> 12:43.545
is good for healing the body.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.858
What do you think?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.077
I think he's a man
who's dying

12:54.077 --> 12:57.080
and wants to save his soul,
and not his son.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.082
And I still don't trust him.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.132
We ought to get a look
at what he's offering.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.529
All right.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.096
I'm gonna text the DA.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.924
You'll have to go outside,

13:14.924 --> 13:16.796
although the signal's
not much better.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.797
Landline?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.103
No.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.279
- All right. I'll be back.
- Uh-huh.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.504
<i>Sarge?</i>

13:29.504 --> 13:31.941
<i>Jet, get in touch with the
district attorney's office.</i>

13:31.941 --> 13:33.247
They should have
an ADA on standby,

13:33.247 --> 13:35.379
ready to meet us
as soon as possible.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.511
Copy that.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.121
<i>Okay,
and grab Jamie and Reyes,</i>

13:38.121 --> 13:39.731
<i>and meet us here as well.</i>

13:39.731 --> 13:40.907
Robert's still a fugitive.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.038
I want to have backup.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.997
We'll be there
in less than 20.

13:43.997 --> 13:44.998
Okay, try to get here sooner
if you--

13:46.608 --> 13:47.609
Hello?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.266
Dang it.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.748
Pretty elaborate
security system

13:56.748 --> 13:59.316
for an abandoned building.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.232
This place was never so much
about warehousing

14:02.232 --> 14:05.583
as it was a safe place
to do business.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.978
It became a sort of home
away from home, actually.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.284
For everything you've done,

14:10.284 --> 14:11.676
and this is all
you've got left.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.417
Mm.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.203
All men make a choice
at some point.

14:16.203 --> 14:19.075
To be a good father,
good husband,

14:19.075 --> 14:21.077
or good at your job.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.427
I made my choice
a long time ago.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.952
It took over everything
in my life.

14:27.257 --> 14:31.131
Guess this tumor thing
made me realize

14:31.131 --> 14:32.262
putting your name
on the building

14:32.262 --> 14:34.874
doesn't secure your legacy.

14:34.874 --> 14:40.749
Family, kids,
the next generation.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.490
That's what it's about.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.279
Pearl's pregnant.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.370
What?

14:53.370 --> 14:54.415
No.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.899
Grandson.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.596
They were gonna name him
after you.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.559
I had no idea.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.873
Robert, if you're
really serious about this,

15:17.873 --> 15:20.267
you've got to stay alive.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.964
Because as good
as those tapes may be,

15:21.964 --> 15:24.097
what's important
is you testifying.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.101
And then you're gonna realize
what this deal

15:28.101 --> 15:29.929
really is worth to your family.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.682
Hope I'm in the right place.

15:44.682 --> 15:45.770
Who are you?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.859
ADA Polson.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.166
Supposed to meet with Robert.
- Oh, you got here quick.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.646
Uh, you have the
proffer agreements?

15:51.646 --> 15:53.953
Yeah, I brought it.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.258
So where is he?

15:55.258 --> 15:57.695
On the third floor,
through that door.

15:57.695 --> 15:58.740
Lead the way?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.263
I got to wait on my team,

16:00.263 --> 16:03.440
and cell phone service is,
like, nonexistent.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.616
But Detective Stabler
is already up there.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.966
So it's just two
of them up there?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.098
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.404
No problem.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.501
Wait here.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.688
Stop!

16:33.688 --> 16:35.385
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.302
Hold on. Who are you?

16:39.302 --> 16:41.043
So sorry, I got here
as fast as I could.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.262
Who are you?

16:42.262 --> 16:43.350
I'm from the DA's office.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.134
Detective Slootmaekers called.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.702
She told me I had to
be here right away.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.747
Okay, show me your
credentials, right now.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.059
Okay, I need you to call 911.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.235
Tell them we need
as many units as possible.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.323
What's happening?

17:00.323 --> 17:03.022
911!
Officers need assistance!

17:18.863 --> 17:20.126
Detective Stabler?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.041
Who are you?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.216
ADA Polson.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.264
Where's Sergeant Bell?

17:28.264 --> 17:29.831
She mentioned
there were others coming,

17:29.831 --> 17:31.833
and she was gonna
wait for them downstairs.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.707
Where's Mr. Silas?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.187
This way. Follow me.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.196
You all right?

17:47.196 --> 17:49.590
Yeah, I just didn't expect
my day to turn out like this

17:49.590 --> 17:51.026
when I came into work
this morning.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.027
Ah.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.342
Just how big you think the
rats are in this building, huh?

18:02.342 --> 18:03.604
This way.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.102
Come on!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.755
So I heard the
DA's office isn't

18:24.755 --> 18:26.540
having their holiday party down
on Center Street this year.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.237
What's going on with that?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.978
I mean, they don't know
their heads from their asses,

18:29.978 --> 18:31.893
if you ask me, man.
- Mm.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.721
Hey, he tell you
anything in there?

18:33.721 --> 18:35.418
No, not yet.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.812
But he's, uh--
he's in there?

18:37.812 --> 18:39.596
Yeah, yeah. Right in there.
Uh, I'll get him.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.381
Just wait here.
- Right.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.643
You got it.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.921
Get up. Get up.
Get in there.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.533
- What the hell is going on?
- Shh.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.144
Stuff yourself
in that corner, now.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.316
This the right place?

19:47.316 --> 19:49.231
That's Stabler's car.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.146
Hey, you see that?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.539
Who's that?

19:52.539 --> 19:55.846
Hey! Hey!

19:59.110 --> 20:00.416
Hey!

20:00.416 --> 20:02.026
Don't hurt me! Please.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.245
Why are you running?
Who are you?

20:03.245 --> 20:06.205
Sanders.
I'm from the DA's office.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.598
OC task force.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.991
Oh, thank God.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.166
I've been trying to reach 911,

20:11.166 --> 20:12.515
but my cell phone service
isn't working.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.647
911? Why?

20:15.170 --> 20:17.259
Stay here.
Keep calling.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.407
We'll split up.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.365
I'll take the stairs
on this side.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.891
Stabler!

20:43.416 --> 20:44.852
Stairs.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.288
What about Robert?

20:46.288 --> 20:47.855
He'll be fine.
He ain't going nowhere.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.815
You get hit?
- I'm good.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.339
Let's go, let's go.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.392
I'll get out here.
You keep going.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.407
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.909
- You good?
- I'm good. Go.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.575
- You good?
- Yeah.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.129
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.217
All right,
we need a team down there.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.175
You two, with me.
Let's go.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.481
- Robert.
- Yeah.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.004
Uh, back office,
where we left off.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.398
- All right, you're with me.
- Uh, Sarge?

24:03.398 --> 24:05.182
Stop looking at my leg,
and let's go.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.232
Call the bus?

24:11.232 --> 24:13.930
He's going to the morgue.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.280
We need some help
out here, though.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.461
That's got to be his car.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.595
Check it out.
See if you can find some ID.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.774
Can't get a signal.

24:31.774 --> 24:32.949
Ah, great.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.691
We got to get Silas
out of here.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.480
Nope.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.617
Hey, we got more company.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.152
Jamie, get over here! Now!

25:02.152 --> 25:03.937
Go! I'm right behind you. Go.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.112
All right, go.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.962
Jamie's been hit.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.529
- We saw it on the monitors.
- Where is he?

25:30.529 --> 25:31.747
Headed to the
other stairwell.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.662
- Where?
- To the east of us.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.011
He just went in that door
to the east of us.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.187
Do all the stairwells
lead here?

25:37.187 --> 25:39.059
Yes. No.
I'm not sure.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.669
What about all the
other men coming up?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.105
We're not getting past
all those guys.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.367
Ammo just run out.
You got a new clip?

25:43.367 --> 25:44.760
Yeah.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.327
Maybe we can find them
on the monitors.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.502
Okay, let's barricade
the door

25:47.502 --> 25:49.025
while we come up with a plan.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.941
We can't save Jamie
if we're getting ambushed.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.595
Let's go!

26:06.129 --> 26:07.609
How many men were there?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.219
At least three vehicles
pulled up.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.787
But I didn't get a head count.
- They're like cockroaches.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.223
Jamie.

26:13.223 --> 26:14.355
Where?

26:14.355 --> 26:16.009
Second floor camera.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.227
We gotta get him
out of there.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.402
How do we get to him?

26:18.402 --> 26:20.579
Hold on.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.189
Looks like he's, uh--

26:22.189 --> 26:23.756
no.

26:23.756 --> 26:24.800
Yes.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.976
Wait, wait.
I know where he is.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.587
But you have to go down
that stairwell.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.632
<i>Up here!</i>

26:30.632 --> 26:31.764
We gotta get him
out of there.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.679
Close-quarter combat
in a stairwell

26:33.679 --> 26:34.897
when we're outgunned?

26:34.897 --> 26:36.812
No.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.597
There's got to be a
heating-cooling pump station

26:38.597 --> 26:40.033
between the two floors.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.643
Do you have any old
building plans in here?

26:41.643 --> 26:44.515
Yeah. Yeah, this way.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.082
Okay, what are we looking
for?

26:46.082 --> 26:48.432
These old buildings, built
before strict safety codes.

26:48.432 --> 26:51.610
There will be exposed duct
work, voids between floors.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.089
Where are we?

26:53.089 --> 26:57.833
We're, uh--we're here on
the third floor, and he's--

26:57.833 --> 26:59.748
he's here on the second floor.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.360
We need to be here.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.927
Pump station room.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.799
We can get inside through
the back stairwell,

27:06.799 --> 27:09.105
and then we can just climb down
into the room Jamie's in.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.759
Inside?

27:10.759 --> 27:12.805
Says there's a service panel
next to the fire door.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.328
How small is the space?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.590
- Small.
- I'll go.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.809
I'll go with you.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.375
- You got a bad leg.
- I'm fine.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.420
You keep saying that.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.292
Because I am fine!

27:22.292 --> 27:24.904
And this is my task force,
and I'm not leaving

27:24.904 --> 27:27.515
a man behind on our last day.

27:29.822 --> 27:33.216
Now, show me where
this thing is.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.486
Head to your right
about 100 feet.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.010
There's a ladder.

28:02.855 --> 28:03.812
Jamie?

28:06.249 --> 28:07.207
Jamie?

28:11.080 --> 28:11.864
Where you at?

28:11.864 --> 28:12.995
Stabler.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.739
Hey.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.828
How'd you find me?

28:19.828 --> 28:21.351
How do you think?
Count of three.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.352
One, two.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.183
- How bad is it?
- I'm good.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.402
Go.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.384
All right.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.082
This is as good as it's
gonna get right now.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.954
How you feeling?
- Better. Thanks.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.087
<i>Hello?</i>

29:01.087 --> 29:02.566
Who's talking?

29:02.566 --> 29:05.744
<i>Hello, hello, hello, hello.</i>

29:05.744 --> 29:07.615
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

29:09.748 --> 29:11.227
Who is that?

29:11.227 --> 29:12.359
Elio Costello.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.491
Enforcer. Russo crime family.

29:14.491 --> 29:17.103
<i>All right,
so this is pretty simple.</i>

29:17.103 --> 29:19.235
<i>You send Robert down,
I call off the dogs.</i>

29:19.235 --> 29:23.152
<i>You don't, then us,
we're coming up.</i>

29:24.937 --> 29:26.852
<i>And in case you need
a little added incentive...</i>

29:32.683 --> 29:34.076
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

29:34.076 --> 29:38.080
<i>Give me Robert,
or watch this man die.</i>

29:52.355 --> 29:54.705
Reyes. Reyes!

29:54.705 --> 29:55.968
Find a way down?
- Uh-uh.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.753
Any luck with the signal?

29:58.753 --> 30:00.276
Nope.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.801
And this is a brand-new phone,
latest technology.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.237
Figured it'd work better.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.331
- Brand-new, huh?
- Yup.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.300
I'll buy you a new one.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.087
My wife got me that phone.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.785
Come on, let's go.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.223
It's been just
under two minutes.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.616
One more, and we go check?

30:35.616 --> 30:37.096
No. No.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.141
We stay together with Robert.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.795
Elliot can manage.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.234
You could have been
in Italy, huh?

30:47.367 --> 30:50.109
Tia called me before she left.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.154
She told you
I said yes to the job?

30:52.154 --> 30:53.547
She called to see
if you were free,

30:53.547 --> 30:56.028
since the task force is ending.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.813
I gave you
a glowing recommendation.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.732
I don't blame you.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.255
I mean, it's a good move.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.040
It still may be.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.215
Sarge...

31:13.132 --> 31:14.568
I don't want to go.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.573
What'd you find?

31:19.573 --> 31:20.922
Nothing.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.445
He did throw my phone
off the roof, though.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.360
It's one of those new phones
that registers

31:24.360 --> 31:25.796
if you've been in an accident.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.624
I was just trying to get it
out of the dead zone

31:27.624 --> 31:30.323
so that on impact, it would
send out a 911 signal.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.933
Well, how far
did you throw it?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.935
So far.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.155
And how did they know? Huh?

31:36.155 --> 31:38.418
- Why are you asking me?
- What's going on?

31:38.418 --> 31:40.463
I'm asking Robert here
how a group of mobsters

31:40.463 --> 31:42.552
just happened to show up
to a secret location

31:42.552 --> 31:44.946
right after we do.
- What are you really saying?

31:44.946 --> 31:46.513
I'm saying this whole thing's
felt like a set-up

31:46.513 --> 31:47.862
to lure us in
and take us all out.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.125
And why would I go
through all that trouble?

31:50.125 --> 31:51.474
I don't know.

31:51.474 --> 31:52.649
You tried to kill your
own daughter-in-law.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.303
You tell me.
- Jamie, enough. Enough.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.523
All right, then send his ass
downstairs so we can go home!

31:56.523 --> 31:59.221
Detective, you're part of the
Organized Crime task force.

31:59.221 --> 32:02.529
We don't negotiate
with people like that.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.313
Was that not clear
to you when you signed up?

32:07.664 --> 32:08.578
<i>Hello?</i>

32:08.578 --> 32:09.928
<i>You all still up there?</i>

32:09.928 --> 32:11.712
<i>Come to the monitor
so you can see me.</i>

32:11.712 --> 32:13.540
<i>Hurry up.</i>

32:13.540 --> 32:15.759
<i>All right, so you got
five minutes left, right?</i>

32:15.759 --> 32:18.849
<i>But I just, uh,
wanted to show you</i>

32:18.849 --> 32:20.808
<i>what I was gonna do
with my time.</i>

32:33.212 --> 32:34.517
Oh!

32:34.517 --> 32:37.042
You're all right.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.000
<i>You're all right.</i>

32:39.000 --> 32:42.830
<i>So for every extra minute
you want to wait now,</i>

32:42.830 --> 32:44.701
<i>I'm gonna put a new bullet
into this gun.</i>

32:44.701 --> 32:46.051
<i>So I guess the question is,</i>

32:46.051 --> 32:48.618
<i>how much time you really have,
right?</i>

32:48.618 --> 32:50.925
<i>Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.</i>

33:07.942 --> 33:10.162
All right.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.251
We're gonna give them Robert.

33:24.263 --> 33:25.655
I want to see hands.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.266
Make sure there's no weapons.

33:29.746 --> 33:32.445
Turn around.
Let me see your waist.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.146
All right.

33:38.146 --> 33:41.758
Now, Robert, and only Robert,
walk towards me.

33:41.758 --> 33:44.457
You send Sanders
at the same time.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.938
Okay.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.202
On three, yeah?

33:50.202 --> 33:51.942
One,

33:51.942 --> 33:53.161
two,

33:53.161 --> 33:54.206
go.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.848
Go, go, go, go.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.335
Everybody out!

34:36.335 --> 34:38.206
Everybody, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

34:44.778 --> 34:46.040
It actually worked.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.650
I have a wife, kids.
Thank you.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.522
We're gonna do everything
we can to get you back to them.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.403
They're gonna break
through those doors.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.013
Sarge, how do you
want to do this?

35:03.013 --> 35:04.885
They're gonna funnel
through here at some point.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.539
All right.
You guys, in the room.

35:06.539 --> 35:07.757
Close the door.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.237
Do not come out
under any circumstances.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.456
- What if you don't make it?
- We're going to make it.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.761
We're all gonna make it.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.286
Just stick together,
have each other's back.

35:14.286 --> 35:17.332
Look, there are
two ways in here.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.118
You got to control the doors,
shoulder to shoulder.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.600
Present as one.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.211
Conserve what you can.

35:36.264 --> 35:37.526
Stay focused.

35:56.806 --> 35:57.894
The monitors.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.594
<i>This is the New York City
Police Department.</i>

36:01.594 --> 36:02.769
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

36:02.769 --> 36:04.162
<i>It's the cops!</i>

36:12.561 --> 36:14.911
<i>Come out slowly
with your hands up.</i>

36:14.911 --> 36:16.565
<i>This is the New York City--</i>

36:32.059 --> 36:33.800
<i>One at a time.</i>

36:33.800 --> 36:35.323
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

36:35.323 --> 36:37.630
<i>- Hands behind your heads!
- Get down! Get down!</i>

36:37.630 --> 36:39.327
<i>Get down!</i>

36:46.378 --> 36:47.335
<i>Clear!</i>

36:52.862 --> 36:54.429
Stabler.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.822
It worked.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.954
Units responded to the 911
call, radioed for backup

36:57.954 --> 36:59.739
when they heard the shots.
- Still work?

36:59.739 --> 37:00.914
Yep.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.830
Hell of a throw, by the way.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.311
- How's that arm?
- No major damage.

37:06.311 --> 37:09.009
Looks I'm gonna lose
my SpongeBob tattoo, though.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.359
You do not have
a SpongeBob tattoo.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.882
Long story.

37:15.711 --> 37:16.799
Good work today.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.279
Hey.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.499
I'm sorry things
got heated up there.

37:20.499 --> 37:21.500
I was being a jerk.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.545
You did the right thing.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.113
We have a hell of a team.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.810
I'm really proud of us.

37:33.686 --> 37:37.080
Detective, I plan to stay
alive as long as I can.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.908
So let's--
let's finish this, okay?

37:43.652 --> 37:45.872
I got a grandson coming.

38:02.584 --> 38:03.629
Hey.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.021
Thought you were
taking the day off?

38:06.893 --> 38:08.329
I was.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.940
Well,
you certainly earned it.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.378
I was just here checking
on the renovation.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.554
What's happening with Robert?

38:15.554 --> 38:17.512
Oh, that debrief's
gonna take months,

38:17.512 --> 38:20.123
but he's already given us
quite the list.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.951
Robert's attorney
confessed to giving up

38:21.951 --> 38:24.040
his location
after the Russo family

38:24.040 --> 38:25.172
found out what he was up to.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.913
Threatened her life.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.697
You lady down
with dogs, I guess.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.010
I'm not taking
the job, Lillian.

38:40.796 --> 38:41.928
What?

38:41.928 --> 38:44.365
I called the chief
this morning.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.411
My place is here, with my team.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.803
Always has been.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.592
Am I interrupting?

38:53.592 --> 38:55.507
No.

38:55.507 --> 38:58.727
You do know the limb
I went out on for you, Ayanna.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.642
And I will return the favor.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.296
You really turned it down?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.868
You're making a huge mistake.

39:08.868 --> 39:12.393
No, the mistake I made was
saying yes in the first place.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.352
I'm trying to correct that.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.314
First I'm hearing about it.

39:20.314 --> 39:23.099
Well, it won't be the last.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.101
Believe me.

39:31.543 --> 39:32.587
I know.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.328
I didn't consult you
on this, either.

39:34.328 --> 39:37.026
I guess we both need
to work on that.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.770
You want to work on it with me?

39:41.770 --> 39:43.816
Sure. I got plenty of time.

39:43.816 --> 39:46.645
All right, give me
a hand with something.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.738
Jamie got me this.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.482
Yeah, he got me
one of those too.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.005
I never knew
he was such a hippie.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.487
Have you ever done a cleansing?

40:02.487 --> 40:05.098
Do I look like
I've ever done a cleansing?

40:06.752 --> 40:09.711
Well, I think
we could all use one.

40:11.496 --> 40:15.456
So not taking the job
was what was best for you?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.980
It's what was best for us.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.286
For all of us.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.695
Go a couple of times
around my desk.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.740
Oh, I will.
