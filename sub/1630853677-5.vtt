20:36.737 --> 20:39.281
- Tell me why we didn't hire
somebody to do this for us.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.741
Oh, because you're so cheap.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.577
- Thank you. Just needed to remember.
- Mm-hm.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.632
Ah!

21:00.469 --> 21:01.678
Are you okay?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.932
- I think I'm... I'm okay.
- Oh.

21:06.475 --> 21:10.229
I'm really sorry.
Things with wheels are very hard for me.

21:10.229 --> 21:12.439
- Oh.
- I'm Amy.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.441
I'm Dave.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.364
Do you wanna stare into
each other's eyes for a bit,

21:20.364 --> 21:22.157
and take me to the infirmary?

21:22.908 --> 21:23.742
Yes.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.828
In what order?

21:27.955 --> 21:29.957
