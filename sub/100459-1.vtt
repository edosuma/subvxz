35:15.071 --> 35:18.241
Nice! Boy's got game.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.285
And, I got you a little V-Day gift
of my own.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.169
- Oh, Chris, that's so sweet...
- It's advice.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.413
Okay. [chuckles]

35:24.497 --> 35:26.207
Before you go too far with Kavinsky,

35:26.290 --> 35:29.335
make sure you are 100 percent...

35:29.418 --> 35:34.549
- No, 1000 percent sure...
- That it's something that I want. I know.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.152
- Trust me, I'm not...
- Actually, I was gonna say something else.

35:37.176 --> 35:40.513
I am trying to make sure you know
how to rev your own engine

35:40.596 --> 35:44.684
before you let anyone under the hood.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.105
Chris, we all know
you can't wink. It's okay.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.525
I'm just saying! Make sure you know
how to look after you!

35:52.608 --> 35:54.610
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it, thank you.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.369
[Trevor] Hey.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.121
Mm-hmm.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.624
Are you sure there's no other reason why
you wanted to eat in the woodshop today?

36:09.167 --> 36:12.920
We both like the smell of sawdust
and that is not a crime.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.046
I'm gonna go.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.762
I think this is yours.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.267
Thanks.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.979
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.147
Shut up.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.820
- Oh! John Ambrose, good to see you again!
- Hi, Mrs. Glick.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.071
Oh, hi, John.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.617
Today's gonna be a fun day.
I have an exciting project for you two.

36:42.700 --> 36:46.329
Our annual Belleview garden party
is coming up.

36:46.412 --> 36:50.583
Last year we got rained out,
so we decided to move it indoors.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.585
So we're gonna do
the garden party in here?

36:52.668 --> 36:55.504
Yup! Put out some potted ferns,
cheese platter.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.308
I dunno, some twinkle lights?
It'll be fine.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.884
But, I need you two
to clear out this space.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.053
- It's become a bit of a junk room.
- Wow.

37:02.136 --> 37:02.970
What is this?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.056
Mr. Sawoski's failed green thumb attempt

37:05.139 --> 37:08.559
and belongings of residents who passed.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.978
Alone. With no family members
to claim them.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.857
Make two piles, okay? Trash and donations.

37:25.326 --> 37:29.247
When I heard "garden party,"
I imagined art deco elegance.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.958
Not a couple potted plants
and a cheese plate.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.336
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of depressing.

37:35.878 --> 37:36.921
Yeah.

37:39.715 --> 37:40.800
Look at this.

37:43.552 --> 37:47.098
Oh. Old love letters
from someone stationed in Italy.

37:51.852 --> 37:54.855
He sent her his photo
with a note on the back.

37:55.481 --> 37:56.816
"My darling Linda..."

37:58.859 --> 38:01.612
Oh, this seems personal.
I feel a little funny reading this.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.407
[John Ambrose] Wanna read this instead?

38:05.866 --> 38:08.452
Remember, it's only a loan.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.708
That it is.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.389
[sighs]

38:32.351 --> 38:33.728
Mm. Okay...

38:40.651 --> 38:42.528
<i>"Dear John Ambrose,</i>

38:42.695 --> 38:45.489
<i>do you remember the Halloween party
at Matt Kaplan's barn?</i>

38:46.198 --> 38:49.702
<i>I planned my costume for weeks.
I was so excited.</i>

38:49.785 --> 38:51.746
<i>I didn't tell anyone what I was gonna be.</i>

38:51.829 --> 38:54.081
<i>And then, I got there.</i>

38:54.165 --> 38:57.293
<i>It's like everyone except me
got the cool kid memo that</i>

38:57.376 --> 38:59.712
<i>no one really dresses up
for Halloween anymore.</i>

39:00.129 --> 39:01.589
<i>I felt so lame.</i>

39:01.672 --> 39:03.799
<i>Like I didn't fit in.</i>

39:04.759 --> 39:07.678
<i>And then, you walked in as a deviled egg.</i>

39:07.762 --> 39:11.557
<i>And I realized...
maybe I'm lame in a cool way.</i>

39:11.640 --> 39:13.225
<i>And that's when I knew.</i>

39:13.309 --> 39:16.562
<i>I knew it all the way down
to my candy red sneakers.</i>

39:16.645 --> 39:20.316
<i>I love you, John Ambrose.
I really love you.</i>

39:21.150 --> 39:23.903
<i>Why, oh, why do you have to move away?</i>

39:24.737 --> 39:28.741
<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again,
and you'll never know I felt any of this.</i>

39:29.158 --> 39:30.701
<i>But, I'll know.</i>

39:30.785 --> 39:33.537
<i>I'll always know that once upon a time,</i>

39:33.954 --> 39:35.539
<i>my heart was yours."</i>

39:40.294 --> 39:42.004
<i>I cannot believe I wrote that.</i>

39:42.296 --> 39:43.839
<i>I cannot believe he read that.</i>

39:43.923 --> 39:47.385
<i>I cannot believe he's downstairs knowing
I just read what he read that I wrote.</i>

39:47.468 --> 39:48.594
[door closing]

39:50.179 --> 39:52.139
[Stormy] Lara Jean, are you okay?

39:52.765 --> 39:54.850
I don't know.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.727
Come into my room.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.064
No woman should be out in public
with that look on her face.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.609
"Maybe one day, we'll meet again.

40:03.692 --> 40:06.070
I'll always know that once upon a time,

40:06.612 --> 40:08.447
my heart was yours.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.324
Love, Lara Jean."

40:10.741 --> 40:11.784
Why?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.120
Why did I write these stupid love letters?

40:14.203 --> 40:15.955
I think it's exciting.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.958
You predicted that you'd meet again.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.251
And here you are.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.335
I have a boyfriend.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.381
So? Almost every one of my love affairs
overlapped with another one.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.466
Well, this is different.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.861
Peter and I promised
not to break each other's hearts.

40:29.885 --> 40:32.221
Oh, honey, you're always
breaking someone's heart,

40:32.304 --> 40:33.597
or they're breaking yours.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.267
Well, isn't there a way
to both get out unscathed?

40:36.934 --> 40:38.227
Not if you're doing it right.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.522
I think it's time we both had a drink.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.690
Stormy.

40:43.691 --> 40:44.692
I'm 16.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.110
Suit yourself.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.446
More for me.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.656
I'll just get you some soda.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.701
When I was young, the drinking age was 18,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.161
and you're not far from that.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.538
That's about when I met my first husband.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.621
How did you meet?

40:58.664 --> 41:00.416
Oh, he was our neighbor.

41:00.499 --> 41:01.709
And he was a songwriter.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.379
And I can remember sitting around
our living room, listening to him sing.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.465
And then one day,

41:07.548 --> 41:10.468
I discovered that the song was about me.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.013
If a man ever writes you a song,

41:15.055 --> 41:18.267
then you know for sure
that he's got it bad.

41:18.809 --> 41:19.935
What about a poem?

41:20.019 --> 41:21.520
Well, yeah. Sure. Same thing.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.315
A poem is just a song
without the music part.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.068
For Valentine's Day,
Peter wrote me the most beautiful poem.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.029
I bet you know it, too.

41:31.530 --> 41:32.698
[sighing]

41:33.282 --> 41:36.243
"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

41:36.327 --> 41:37.995
of beautiful Lara Jean.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.331
And the stars never rise..."

41:40.414 --> 41:42.541
"But I feel the bright eyes

41:42.833 --> 41:44.627
of beautiful Annabel Lee."

41:45.836 --> 41:47.213
Uh, how did you...

41:49.757 --> 41:53.511
Your young man has very good taste.
I'll give him that.

41:54.428 --> 41:58.015
But I'm sorry to tell you
that the author of that particular poem

41:58.724 --> 42:00.017
is Edgar Allen Poe.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.648
You want to rethink that drink option?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.110
[boy] Go!

42:10.194 --> 42:12.029
[indistinct chatter and music]

42:12.112 --> 42:13.155
Ah!

42:15.282 --> 42:17.993
- [laughter]
- Oh, wait, come on. What was that?

42:18.536 --> 42:21.747
- Let's go, I ain't stopping!
- [Gen] Let's take one for Insta.

42:22.164 --> 42:23.541
- Hi, Mom.
- [camera clicks]

42:25.000 --> 42:26.335
Now one for the real Insta.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.295
[Trevor] Whipped wonderworld.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.672
The secret ingredient is...

42:29.755 --> 42:31.355
- Whipped cream?
- That's why it's the...

42:31.423 --> 42:32.508
Yeah, I think you should...

42:32.591 --> 42:34.134
- What?
- Yeah.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.262
[Lucas] Okay...

42:36.804 --> 42:39.640
Anywho, last ice cream sandwich.
You wanna split it?

42:39.723 --> 42:40.723
Thanks.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.435
Dude! Every time!

42:44.019 --> 42:46.105
- Not into flip cup, huh?
- Like, ever.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.649
Don't hate the player. Hate the game.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.067
I just said I hate the game.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.069
Okay. Spill it.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.029
I just need a break.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.323
From the contortions
of being someone's girlfriend.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.075
Oh, no, what is he doing to you?

42:58.158 --> 43:00.828
[giggling] No, it's not like that.
It's, like, mentally.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.247
- All right. Go on.
- It's like this.

43:03.330 --> 43:05.541
We're here and we're sharing
an ice cream sandwich.

43:05.624 --> 43:06.667
And it's great.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.270
But if Peter was here
and we were sharing an ice cream sandwich,

43:09.295 --> 43:10.921
I don't know, I'd be thinking about...

43:11.171 --> 43:14.383
has Peter shared an ice cream
sandwich with someone before?

43:14.466 --> 43:16.594
And if he has, was it with Gen?

43:16.677 --> 43:18.178
Does he think that I'm a prude

43:18.262 --> 43:20.598
if I just wanna share
an ice cream sandwich?

43:20.681 --> 43:21.599
Maybe it's me.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.935
Maybe I'm the one who wants to do more
than just share an ice cream sandwich.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.397
So the answer to all of those questions...

43:28.856 --> 43:30.149
is... is I don't know.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.484
Is this what happens in a girl's mind?

43:32.568 --> 43:36.071
- That's what goes on in this girl's mind.
- Well, I am glad I am not you.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.033
And not your ice cream.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.242
So, back up.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.785
[sighs]

43:46.457 --> 43:48.626
- Hey, Lucas?
- Mm-hmm.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.462
- Do you remember John Ambrose McClaren?
- Yeah.

43:51.545 --> 43:52.630
Of course.

43:52.713 --> 43:55.132
I was like obsessed with him
in the fifth grade.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.719
Well, him and Michael B. Jordan in <i>Creed.</i>

43:58.802 --> 43:59.845
[chuckles]

43:59.928 --> 44:02.139
I was obsessed with him in sixth grade.

44:03.932 --> 44:05.893
He's volunteering at Belleview with me.

44:06.518 --> 44:08.520
Not that it means anything.

44:08.812 --> 44:11.273
I'm perfectly happy
in my relationship with Peter.

44:12.691 --> 44:16.111
It's just like the stuff that I was
telling you about, like the overthinking,

44:17.363 --> 44:19.698
that doesn't happen
when I'm with John Ambrose.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.033
It's, like, easy.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.287
But that's probably because
we're just friends, right?

44:25.412 --> 44:27.164
You're lucky, LJ.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.125
- Lucky how?
- You have options.

44:31.168 --> 44:34.380
There's like, what, two gay dudes
at our school?

44:36.340 --> 44:37.549
I'm sorry.

44:37.883 --> 44:40.427
I've been thinking about my own problems
and not even...

44:40.803 --> 44:43.055
thinking about what you're going through.

44:43.138 --> 44:45.224
[boy] Ah, come on!

44:45.307 --> 44:46.350
Listen,

44:46.809 --> 44:47.810
sooner than we think,

44:47.893 --> 44:50.771
we're gonna be out of high school
and we're gonna be in the real world,

44:51.438 --> 44:53.607
and guys are gonna be lining up for you.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.027
And what makes you so sure?

44:57.820 --> 44:59.405
'Cause before I knew you were gay,

45:00.614 --> 45:02.032
I was first in line.

45:04.785 --> 45:08.288
Well, that was one hell of a speech
just to get another bite.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.415
[Lara Jean chuckles]

45:09.498 --> 45:10.541
[call phone chimes]

45:17.881 --> 45:21.218
Wait, hold up. Are you guys texting
each other when he's just 20 feet away?

45:21.719 --> 45:22.719
Hey.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.762
Wanna go?

45:25.180 --> 45:26.181
Okay.

45:27.474 --> 45:28.726
Bye, Lucas.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.852
Mm-hmm.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.896
Good night, you two.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.440
- Yes, yes!
- [laughing]

45:36.316 --> 45:38.156
- I didn't know you were friends.
- [Chris] No.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.903
- Nothing to see here.
- Mm-mm.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.864
- [Trevor] Leave.
- [Chris] Bye, LJ.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.248
Hey.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.251
You okay?

45:56.211 --> 45:58.297
Just, you were a little quiet tonight.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.007
Can I ask you something?

46:01.216 --> 46:03.343
Yeah. Of course.

46:04.678 --> 46:07.890
[sighs] It's about the...
the poem you wrote me.

46:12.978 --> 46:14.897
I never said that <i>I...</i>

46:16.273 --> 46:17.608
wrote... wrote it.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.069
I'm sorry. Look, you were so happy

46:22.112 --> 46:27.785
when I read it to you, that I...
I mean, I wished that I had written it,

46:27.868 --> 46:30.996
and that I could actually write something
like that for you. I...

46:31.455 --> 46:32.956
But you're the writer.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.586
Are you mad?

46:40.172 --> 46:41.172
No.

46:41.924 --> 46:42.925
I love it.

46:43.425 --> 46:46.428
That's good because
even if I didn't write it,

46:47.554 --> 46:49.306
it's still how I feel about you.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.644
Beautiful Lara Jean.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.198
[Lara Jean] <i>Wow.</i>

47:06.740 --> 47:08.450
<i>He's really good at this.</i>

47:09.284 --> 47:11.870
<i>How is he so good at this?</i>

47:14.957 --> 47:18.126
<i>And how does he know
how to do that so easily?</i>

47:20.712 --> 47:22.047
How do you think?

47:23.340 --> 47:25.467
You know what else he's really good at?

47:26.343 --> 47:30.264
[whispering] Uh, I don't wanna have sex
with you right now.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.348
Oh.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.435
That's all right. I... I wasn't...

47:35.936 --> 47:38.397
I wasn't trying to have sex
with you right now.

47:38.981 --> 47:41.358
- I just... I want to put it out there.
- Okay.

47:41.441 --> 47:42.776
Just in case...

47:42.860 --> 47:45.737
Give me some credit, Covey.
I don't want to rush you.

47:46.280 --> 47:50.033
Especially not in a parked car
in front of your house.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.827
[both laugh]

47:54.079 --> 47:55.831
Did you feel like I'm rushing you?

47:55.914 --> 47:57.833
No. Uh... it's just...

47:57.916 --> 48:02.671
Remember that story about me and Peter
upstairs at last year's graduation party?

48:03.797 --> 48:05.007
No, it's just...

48:06.800 --> 48:09.845
You and Gen used to do it a lot, right?

48:11.096 --> 48:12.806
Can we... can we not...

48:13.348 --> 48:14.850
talk about Gen?

48:14.933 --> 48:16.894
Oh, it's not about Gen, it's, um...

48:17.853 --> 48:18.896
Do you miss sex?

48:20.522 --> 48:22.232
Is there a void in your life?

48:22.316 --> 48:24.109
Is there a void? No.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.568
No.

48:25.819 --> 48:27.279
No, not... not at all.

48:29.364 --> 48:30.741
[sighing]

48:30.824 --> 48:33.702
Okay, think of it like this. Um...

48:34.286 --> 48:36.079
You've been base jumping before.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.874
And I've never,
I've never been base jumping,

48:38.957 --> 48:43.253
so obviously, I would ask you about it
in case it's something that

48:43.629 --> 48:45.505
I would ever want to... do.

48:46.506 --> 48:52.804
I promise if you ever decide
to go base jumping

48:52.888 --> 48:55.599
that I would love to go with you.

49:01.104 --> 49:03.231
It's just a... It's a big decision...

49:04.232 --> 49:06.526
to jump off a cliff, so...

49:08.528 --> 49:09.655
remember that.

49:10.739 --> 49:11.739
Yes.

49:12.950 --> 49:13.950
Okay.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.121
I'm gonna walk you to your door.

49:18.705 --> 49:19.957
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:20.582 --> 49:23.251
[John Ambrose]
Okay, are we all comfortable?

49:23.335 --> 49:24.335
Everyone good?

49:24.378 --> 49:25.712
- Yup,
- All right.

49:26.129 --> 49:28.090
We have a very big prize this week.

49:28.173 --> 49:30.092
It is a wheel of aged gouda

49:30.175 --> 49:33.095
donated by Mrs. Glick's son.
Thank you so much.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.389
- [applause]
- Draw already!

49:35.472 --> 49:38.016
[chuckling] Okay. All right.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.852
First number is...

49:42.938 --> 49:43.772
B-4.

49:43.855 --> 49:46.233
Don't think I've forgotten
you haven't returned my letter.

49:48.777 --> 49:49.777
[Lara Jean] O-62.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.239
John Ambrose, you're not getting
that back. Too embarrassing.

49:54.616 --> 49:55.701
[John Ambrose] B-11.

49:56.243 --> 49:57.327
You want embarrassing?

49:57.411 --> 50:00.372
Try navigating sixth grade Shakespeare
with a stutter.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.791
I don't remember that.

50:03.166 --> 50:04.167
N-32.

50:06.878 --> 50:07.754
G-48.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.924
Fine. But even with a mild stutter,
you were still a hot commodity.

50:11.008 --> 50:14.720
At sleepovers, girls used to say,
"Are you Team Peter or Team John?"

50:15.679 --> 50:16.930
G-60!

50:19.808 --> 50:21.351
Yeah, that's just the thing.

50:22.394 --> 50:24.229
Girls pretended to like me

50:24.479 --> 50:26.106
because I was friends with Peter.

50:26.565 --> 50:27.649
I-24.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.027
You remember the sixth grade
graduation dance?

50:30.110 --> 50:34.114
I couldn't believe when Sabrina Fox
asked me to go with her.

50:34.197 --> 50:35.240
Couldn't believe it.

50:36.074 --> 50:39.286
But then she tried to dance with Peter
the whole night.

50:39.369 --> 50:42.080
Even during the slow songs,
when I couldn't pretend

50:42.164 --> 50:44.458
like we were just dancing in a group.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.542
[woman] Hey!

50:46.376 --> 50:47.461
Cut the chitchat.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.087
Call the numbers.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.051
[John Ambrose] I-25.

50:54.551 --> 50:56.803
I can't wait to be at an age

50:56.887 --> 50:59.514
where I'm not expected to think
that flip cup is fun.

50:59.598 --> 51:02.809
Yeah, I mean, why do you think
we're both volunteering

51:02.893 --> 51:05.145
and hanging out with the senior citizens
on a Saturday?

51:05.228 --> 51:06.354
N-40.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.148
Are we lame?

51:12.486 --> 51:14.738
We might be a little bit. I-30.

51:17.949 --> 51:19.743
But, lame in a cool way.

51:19.826 --> 51:21.870
Totally lame in a cool way.

51:21.953 --> 51:23.205
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.042
[chuckles] B-2?

51:27.125 --> 51:29.086
Whoo! I got BINGO.

51:29.169 --> 51:30.378
[all groaning]

51:30.462 --> 51:32.380
Suck it. [laughs]

51:32.464 --> 51:33.381
[gasps softly]

51:33.465 --> 51:35.050
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

51:35.133 --> 51:37.385
So, um, speaking of Peter Kavinsky,

51:37.469 --> 51:39.888
he told me to tell you
he says hi.

51:40.305 --> 51:41.306
Oh, cool.

51:42.224 --> 51:43.683
You guys still hang out.

51:43.767 --> 51:44.893
We do, actually.

51:44.976 --> 51:47.395
Is he... is he still like he was
in middle school?

51:47.479 --> 51:48.730
What does that mean?

51:48.814 --> 51:52.692
I mean like, okay, at parties and stuff,
he would always

51:52.776 --> 51:54.569
take the last slice of pizza.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.780
And then whenever you tried
to call him out on it,

51:56.863 --> 51:58.365
he'd be like, "I'm an athlete."

51:58.448 --> 51:59.449
[laughs]

52:00.617 --> 52:04.913
And that one time, it was my birthday
and you made me those amazing

52:04.996 --> 52:06.916
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes,
remember those?

52:06.957 --> 52:07.874
- Mm-hmm.
- So good.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.960
And he took the last one of those, too.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.797
But we never even got mad at him,
'cause he's so...

52:14.339 --> 52:15.966
Peter Kavinsky, you know?

52:16.466 --> 52:18.844
Yeah. I do know. Um...

52:18.927 --> 52:20.527
- And...
- Are he and Gen still together?

52:20.595 --> 52:22.514
- Huh?
- I mean, they must be,

52:22.597 --> 52:24.391
since you all still hang out.

52:24.474 --> 52:26.601
No, actually Gen and I
aren't really friends anymore

52:26.685 --> 52:28.478
and she and Peter broke up.

52:29.396 --> 52:30.396
Huh.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.568
That makes sense. No one really
stays together in high school, anyway.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.528
Right. And on that note,

52:36.611 --> 52:38.214
- I think I should tell you...
- [Dorothy] Oh!

52:38.238 --> 52:40.407
What a wonderful team you make.

52:40.490 --> 52:41.741
But this is wrong.

52:41.825 --> 52:43.577
All of the bingo stuff
goes in the basement.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.704
This needs to be cleared out
for the garden party.

52:46.246 --> 52:48.331
I have to go make some prune daiquiris.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.001
- Hey, Dorothy!
- Dorothy?

52:53.879 --> 52:55.159
Did you know there's a basement?

53:04.681 --> 53:05.724
[John Ambrose] Whoa.

53:05.807 --> 53:07.267
Oh, my gosh.

53:14.107 --> 53:17.027
Oh, there's a bust of Mozart over here.
I love his new album.

53:17.110 --> 53:18.110
[laughs]

53:20.488 --> 53:21.488
Hey.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.490
Look.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.497
Forget the stupid garden party
and the potted ferns. Like...

53:30.332 --> 53:32.709
I think we should give the people
what they want.

53:33.001 --> 53:35.921
An excuse to dress up
and dance like they used to.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.004
Yeah?

53:37.797 --> 53:39.477
I think we should bring back
the Star Ball.

53:40.258 --> 53:44.262
I think it's crazy that people think
all old people wanna do is play bingo.

53:44.346 --> 53:45.597
Yeah, totally.

53:46.264 --> 53:47.349
I think it's a great idea.

53:48.266 --> 53:50.060
- Cool. [chuckles]
- Although...

53:51.436 --> 53:56.441
to be fair, I do think that old people
just really love bingo for some reason.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.526
[laughs]

53:58.610 --> 53:59.610
Yeah.

54:00.111 --> 54:02.697
- Do you know what all this reminds me of?
- Hmm?

54:02.781 --> 54:04.241
Uh, the time capsule.

54:04.866 --> 54:06.451
Do you remember when we buried it?

54:07.744 --> 54:11.122
Uh, yeah, it was during
one of our pizza parties at the treehouse.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.290
The pizza parties...

54:13.750 --> 54:17.295
Man, we had such good times
at that treehouse.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.506
Just hanging, you know?

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
Reading.

54:43.989 --> 54:45.573
There's something I need to tell you.

54:45.657 --> 54:46.783
What's up?

54:50.287 --> 54:53.123
Um... they are tearing the treehouse down.

54:53.665 --> 54:54.665
Why?

54:55.250 --> 54:57.919
The Robertsons are moving out

54:58.003 --> 55:00.505
and the new couple,
they don't have kids, so...

55:00.588 --> 55:01.464
The time capsule.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.008
We should dig it up.

55:03.883 --> 55:07.512
And rob future generations
of the discovery?

55:07.595 --> 55:11.599
Future generations are gonna have their
hands full with deforestation.

55:11.683 --> 55:13.101
Urban overcrowding.

55:13.184 --> 55:16.980
And we'll probably be living underwater
at that point, right? [chuckles]

55:18.315 --> 55:19.858
But it could be fun for us.

55:23.445 --> 55:24.445
What do you think?

55:24.946 --> 55:26.781
Yeah, um, that's a great idea.

55:26.865 --> 55:29.701
And we can invite the other people
that were there when we buried it.

55:30.827 --> 55:31.870
Yeah.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.457
Yeah, totally. We'll...
We can invite everybody.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.166
It'd be great.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.419
I'll bring the pizza.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.796
Maybe you can make those

55:42.422 --> 55:44.215
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes?

55:47.719 --> 55:51.014
What makes the octopus's
pulmonary system unique

55:51.431 --> 55:55.352
is it has not one, but three hearts.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.229
Make an incision underneath the ocellus

55:58.938 --> 56:02.150
and you will see the branchial heart.

56:02.233 --> 56:06.112
The octopus is a mollusk
and we will get to see one of those

56:06.196 --> 56:09.532
during next week's visit
to the Portland Aquarium.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.785
- Mm-mmm.
- Okay, here. I got this.

56:12.994 --> 56:14.954
So what are you doing
this Friday? Are you free?

56:15.121 --> 56:16.498
Uh, I'm not sure.

56:16.581 --> 56:17.707
Um, why?

56:18.458 --> 56:20.811
Do you remember the time capsule
that we buried in middle school?

56:20.835 --> 56:22.504
- Mm-hmm.
- We should dig it up.

56:23.505 --> 56:24.547
Just us?

56:25.090 --> 56:28.802
Uh, no, the other people that...
that we buried it with.

56:28.885 --> 56:30.595
- So, Gen?
- No.

56:30.929 --> 56:33.264
I'm not inviting Gen.
She posted that video of us.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.743
Well, we don't know for sure
that she did that anyway, right?

56:35.767 --> 56:38.978
Well, I don't even think she'd come
even if we invited her, so...

56:39.604 --> 56:42.482
It would be me, you, Chris,

56:42.941 --> 56:45.443
Trevor, and John Ambrose.

56:46.861 --> 56:49.155
So you... you, um. wrote him back.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.075
Funny story, um...

56:52.742 --> 56:54.911
we're actually volunteering
at Belleview together.

56:54.994 --> 56:56.329
- No way.
- Yeah.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.497
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

56:59.624 --> 57:01.418
Did you ask him to volunteer with you?

57:01.501 --> 57:04.170
- No, I didn't even write him back.
- Huh.

57:05.046 --> 57:08.007
Jeez, Covey, for a girl
who's never had a boyfriend,

57:08.466 --> 57:10.552
you sure know how to mess with a guy.

57:10.635 --> 57:12.345
[chuckles softly] Excuse me?

57:13.888 --> 57:16.808
Time capsule.
Yeah, let's do it, what the hell?

57:17.684 --> 57:19.352
We don't know what we'll find, right?

57:20.603 --> 57:21.603
Cool.

57:24.274 --> 57:25.191
Watch.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.276
- No, no.
- Watch it.

57:26.359 --> 57:27.569
- Please, I...
- Watch it.

57:27.652 --> 57:28.570
Jesus...

57:28.653 --> 57:30.864
["It Hurts" by Bad Bad Hats playing]

57:39.330 --> 57:41.124
[Kitty] Chocolate peanut butter cupcakes?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.002
Peter prefers salted caramel.

57:48.047 --> 57:49.047
[exhales]

58:07.358 --> 58:08.693
[John Ambrose] Lara Jean.

58:08.860 --> 58:09.986
[Lara Jean] Hey.

58:10.653 --> 58:13.031
Two pepperoni pizzas!
That's probably enough, right?

58:13.114 --> 58:16.117
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Johnny McClaren!

58:16.201 --> 58:17.494
[John Ambrose] Peter Kavinsky.

58:17.577 --> 58:18.745
Hey, man.

58:20.205 --> 58:21.645
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

58:21.706 --> 58:23.225
- How you doing?
- Good, you get pizzas?

58:23.249 --> 58:25.627
- What kind?
- Yeah, pepperoni, just two pepperoni.

58:25.710 --> 58:26.711
It's the safest.

58:26.794 --> 58:30.173
[Lara Jean] <i> I didn't realize until
I saw them standing next to one another</i>

58:30.256 --> 58:32.842
<i>what a spectacularly bad idea this was.</i>

58:32.926 --> 58:35.178
Yo! You guys ordered 'za?

58:35.470 --> 58:37.180
God, I am so hungry!

58:37.555 --> 58:38.890
- John!
- Yeah.

58:38.973 --> 58:40.141
- You made it.
- Yeah.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.101
Dude, I can't believe you made it, man.

58:42.185 --> 58:43.185
It's been so long!

58:43.228 --> 58:47.106
Yeah, well, I mean, LJ and I
planned the thing, so...

58:47.190 --> 58:49.376
- Glad you could come.
- Now we're just waiting for Chris.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.277
So I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail?

58:51.361 --> 58:54.197
Oh, my God. It's Gen and Peter!
Just like old times.

58:59.077 --> 59:01.120
We doin' this or... or what?

59:02.080 --> 59:04.582
Why are you, uh, comin' from the river?

59:04.666 --> 59:06.626
I just buried a dead body.

59:06.751 --> 59:07.835
Yeah, you're next!

59:07.919 --> 59:10.547
- Whoa, okay, calm down, Chris.
- [Chris laughing]

59:10.630 --> 59:12.882
- Let me take this. You got it.
- Oh, thank you.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.718
My shovel.
I don't trust you with this thing.

59:16.135 --> 59:19.264
- Remember where we buried this thing?
- Um, you need some help?

59:19.347 --> 59:21.140
No, we're good, dude. Thank you.

59:21.224 --> 59:22.475
[Trevor] It's about here, yeah?

59:28.606 --> 59:29.607
[metal clanks]

59:29.941 --> 59:31.502
[Peter] That's not how you eat a cupcake.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.462
[Trevor] No, look at that!
She ate it from the bottom up.

59:33.486 --> 59:35.905
[Chris] You know what?
She's saving the best for last!

59:35.989 --> 59:37.156
That's the way to do it.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.033
- [laughter]
- It just felt right.

59:40.618 --> 59:43.371
Hey. Why didn't you ask me
to bring the pizza?

59:44.330 --> 59:46.958
All right, let's bust this bad boy open!

59:47.542 --> 59:49.460
Starting with yours truly.

59:50.503 --> 59:51.879
La, la, la... Oh.

59:51.963 --> 59:53.506
- Who put this in?
- I did.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.424
It's just a bracelet.

59:54.507 --> 59:56.509
It's not just a bracelet, I mean,

59:56.593 --> 59:59.554
that piece of string was
the most valuable thing in your life.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:00.680
I guess.

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:03.349
Baseball.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:06.311
- I am guessing you put that in.
- Yeah, that was me.

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.233
This is when I hit a home run
at Claremont Park.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.608
Wait, I remember that!
You came running off the field

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.794
and then you kissed me
in front of your mom. Remember that?

01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:16.487
Uh, no. No, I don't remember that.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.659
[Trevor] All right. Yep, that's mine.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:26.039
Ah, yes, the Linkin Park concert
at the Crystal Ballroom.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:28.291
- [Chris scoffs] Linkin Park? Nerd.
- What?

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.209
Linkin Park slaps.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.169
Oof.

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:34.881
Hey, McClaren, remember this? This is when
you hopped on the bandwagon,

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.717
- and wore this hat every single day.
- Oh, my God.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.094
Wait, Lara Jean, didn't you get
a Seahawks T-shirt

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.013
'cause you were trying to impress John?

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:43.431
Uh, no.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.975
If that's true,
that's really cute. [chuckles]

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.855
Hey, uh, McClaren,
remember when you had that stutter?

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.357
[Trevor coughs]

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:56.152
No... I just, I noticed you
don't have it anymore.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.291
Yeah, well, dude, thank you.
Appreciate it.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.365
I'm sure that my speech therapist

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.743
would love to know that her methods
were successful. [chuckling]

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:04.826
It's all good.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:12.085
This is to future Chris.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.545
Well, that's me. [laughs]

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.798
Whoa. Ha!

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.509
Genius then...

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.969
genius now.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:23.137
Uh...

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:26.261
I don't know about that. I think a genius
would know the time value of money.

01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:29.060
You know how like a 20 dollar bill now
is actually worth less

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:30.687
than it was six years ago.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.105
- You really got me.
- I know.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.399
Mm-hmm. You're the last one left.
What's inside?

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:36.776
Um, well, it's empty.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.859
Impossible. You put something in there.
We all did.

01:01:38.903 --> 01:01:42.115
Well, I don't really know what to tell you
because there's nothing in there.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.409
Uh, does anyone want the last slice?

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660
Too slow.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.666
- What?
- It's getting too crowded in here.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.251
- [Trevor] Same.
- Yeah, I'm out.

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:55.628
I can stick around and help you
clean up if you want.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:58.047
- I got it.
- [John Ambrose] Oh, dude,

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.426
it's cool. I mean, I kinda helped make
the mess. But it's fine, I don't mind...

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.929
No, man. I think I can handle
helping my girlfriend clean up.

01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:08.266
Thank you, though.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.520
I'll go down. You wanna hand me stuff?

01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:13.604
Okay.

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.064
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:16.858
Sure.

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:23.489
Why didn't you tell McClaren
that you and I are together?

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.093
Well, I wanted to. I tried to.
There just was never a good time.

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:28.202
Yeah, there's usually not,
when you're flirting.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.371
Well, we weren't flirting. So...

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:33.332
Well, next time you need pizza,
just ask me. I'll get it for you.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.084
What is it with you and pizza?

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:36.544
It's not about pizza.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.505
If he brings the pizza then it looks like
you two threw the party.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.965
It sort of was.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.217
You can't do that, Lara Jean.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.511
Not when you have a boyfriend.
Doesn't look right.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:46.387
Oh, right.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:49.515
So, like, inviting your ex-girlfriend
to your current girlfriend's party.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.977
I did not invite her!
Like, officially. I...

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.730
- I might've mentioned it.
- Oh, yeah? When?

01:02:57.648 --> 01:02:58.733
I don't know.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.652
Why does it matter?
You're the one who arranged the pizza.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:05.114
- Okay, we're going around in circles.
- Well, it's not supposed to be like this.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.326
- Then, how's it supposed to be?
- I don't know. Not like this though.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.579
Does that mean you wanna break up?

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.918
Wait, what? No! Why would you say that?

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.002
I don't know.

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:21.589
Is that why you didn't tell John about us?
So you'd keep your options open?

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.424
No! That's not the reason at all.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.303
Okay, fine! Ever since we started dating
for real, I don't know how to act.

01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:29.055
I didn't read the girlfriend's handbook.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.058
Girlfriend's handbook?
Uh... what does that mean?

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:33.938
Like, little stuff. Like I remember Gen
used to dress up for your games.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.062
- Am I supposed to do that?
- It's not just Gen.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.022
Okay, all the girlfriends do that.

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:39.690
Okay, so, do you want me to?

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:42.068
I mean, no, not if you don't want to.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.862
It would be nice,
it would show that you care.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.865
Oh, like sending a serenade to someone
on Valentine's Day, maybe?

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.701
I... I didn't think that was your style.
I mean... [sighs]

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:51.953
Well, it's not my style.

01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:53.454
Okay, so...

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.265
Let's never fight again, okay?

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.727
[softly] Okay.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:17.854
I got this.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.281
This way.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.462
[piano playing faintly]

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.184
[playing soulful song]

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:27.214
You have quite the ability
to remain sneakily silent.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.472
I know I should've told you
about me and Peter.

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:39.685
It's okay.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:42.730
Lara Jean, I...

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.650
I was just embarrassed.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.945
'Cause I... I read it all wrong.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.072
[softly] No.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.699
It's totally my fault.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.452
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.844
Since we're, um...
Since we're coming clean

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.805
about stuff...

01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:18.265
You know how you call me John Ambrose?

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.559
Everyone calls you that.

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:22.186
I know.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:24.563
It's because of you.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:27.733
What?

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:34.657
Before sixth grade, pretty much everybody
called me John.

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:38.244
And then I met you,
and you called me John Ambrose

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:44.166
and said how it was cool that we both
went by our first and middle names.

01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:48.295
I didn't wanna correct you,

01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:51.757
I liked how we had something in common.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.970
So I started telling people
to call me John Ambrose.

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:02.935
Wow.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.604
I don't know what to say.

01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:15.406
Are we good, John...

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.491
Ambrose?

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:18.617
[chuckles softly]

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.246
We've always been good.

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:23.913
Lara...

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:25.623
Jean.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:32.715
[plays quicker]

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.341
[laughs]

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.605
[Lara Jean]
Are we doing Brussels sprouts this year?

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:49.648
Ah, nobody really ate them last year.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:53.027
Kitty says Fakesgiving's
all about the potatoes anyway.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.112
Okay. Then, I think we're good.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.657
On second thought,
I'll get us some Brussels.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.659
- Hi.
- What you doing?

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:01.994
[Trina] You know, just...

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:04.663
making a soup.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.290
- What you got there?
- [giggles]

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:10.336
- Ah, these are good.
- Yes, yeah, those are... those...

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.964
[Lara Jean]
<i>I'd never seen my dad with a crush.</i>

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.841
<i>But, there he was,</i>

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.386
<i>laughing nervously with his hands
in his pockets.</i>

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.348
<i>He looks a little...</i>

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:23.973
<i>hopeless.</i>

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:27.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:31.482
I was supposed to get some
Brussels sprouts but I got distracted...

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:33.274
- uh... for our...
- Ah. I see.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.194
- Fakesgiving.
- Fakesgiving.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.948
It's like regular Thanksgiving,
but it's in March,

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.200
it's a family tradition.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.618
Oh, my God, that's so fun.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:43.911
You should come.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.787
[Dan] Yeah.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.749
Oh, well, I-I don't wanna...

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:52.877
You don't wanna wait
till November for turkey.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:53.962
[laughs]

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.798
[Dan] Right? You wanna come?

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.383
- Yeah, count me in.
- Okay.

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.136
I'll, uh, I'll text ya the deets.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.428
[giggling] Okay.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:04.390
- No one says that.
- That's some nice lingo. [clears throat]

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.475
- I'm glad you're coming.
- Me too.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.519
But there's something
that I should tell you.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.689
You know that valentine that Dad sent you?

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:14.399
Kitty made that.

01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:17.194
Wait, so you're telling me
that the valentine

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.029
that was addressed to Mrs. Rothschild
in glitter glue...

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.031
[laughing]

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.116
...wasn't from your Dad?

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.577

[Dan] What?

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.714
- Get more.
- Okay.

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:38.215
- That's not enough.
- Okay.

[Dan] All right.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.934
Is something wrong with the green beans?

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.145
Uh, they're just a little un-Covey.

01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:55.024
No? I mean everything else
on the table looks like it could be

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:56.942
in one of my mom's
food and wine magazines.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.666
- He noticed.
- [Dan] He's got a good eye.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.336
It's silly, we do a little thing
where I get a can of green beans.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:04.992
No, it's symbolic.
I mean, it's kind of, um, for Mom.

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:07.661
Okay, it sounds like there's
a story there.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.163
Is there a story?

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:14.752
Oh, when I was in college, I got invited
to a Thanksgiving party in a dorm room.

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:17.671
But the weird thing is,
it was the middle of March,

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:21.926
and the girl hosting it
was the coolest girl I ever saw.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:23.844
Evie, their mom.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:28.515
And she thought it was unfair
that the two best holidays of the year

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:31.560
were at the end of the year,
right on top of each other and

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.979
we should just spread the love
a little bit

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.023
and have a potluck for good ol' March.

01:10:36.106 --> 01:10:39.693
Right, and at that potluck,
when everyone made homemade goods,

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:41.278
Dad brought

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.256
- canned green beans.
- Canned green beans.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.615
- Right.
- [all chuckling]

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:46.659
And she made fun of him the entire night.

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.222
She made so much fun of me,
I thought she was really mad at me.

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:52.126
But after, her roommate told you that
that's just how she flirts, right?

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.166
See, she teases you.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.043
- Is that...
- Nope.

01:10:56.126 --> 01:10:57.169
Uh...

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.462

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:00.673
All right, well that is
a really sweet tradition.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:03.050
- Thanks for sharing that story.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.552
Oh, there's one other tradition.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:08.806
Yes. Newcomers have to eat the beans.

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:11.517
- Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, it is very necessary.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.395
Mom made you eat them,
and Margot made Josh, so...

01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:17.273
Oh, well then, yeah. [clears throat]
That sounds pretty set in stone.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:18.356

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:21.652
I don't mind. I like canned goods.

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.445

- Can you pass the cranberry sauce?

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:40.462
I'll cut some turkey.
Will you take this, hon?

exactly where you were. How did she know?
