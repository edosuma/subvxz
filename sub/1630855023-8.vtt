[Jughead] Some towns
are football towns,
some are hockey towns.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.531
Riverdale High had
a so-so football team.

00:09.574 --> 00:13.013
And in the dead of winter,
kids played hockey
on Sweetwater River

00:13.056 --> 00:14.927
once it had frozen solid.

00:14.971 --> 00:18.453
But at its heart,
Riverdale was
a basketball town.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.890
Long past its heyday,
some would say,

00:20.933 --> 00:22.761
which was when
the Riverdale High Bulldogs,

00:22.805 --> 00:25.460
led by point guard
Fred Andrews,

00:25.503 --> 00:27.723
were state champions
three years running.

big loss for Riverdale.

[players cheering]

00:42.955 --> 00:47.569
Hey, look, fellas.
We fought
the good fight out there.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.181
We got the rest of the season

00:51.225 --> 00:53.749
to dust ourselves off,
get back on top.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.186
Not if we keep playing
like pansies.

00:56.230 --> 01:01.583
You're all a bunch
of spineless,
pillow-soft chumps.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.498
You're lucky my parents
still sponsor us.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.194
We're a panic
and a half!

01:05.239 --> 01:07.154
Cut the gas, Captain.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.592
Nobody's jazzed
about what happened out there.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.899
The Bulldogs?

01:13.943 --> 01:16.119
We used to be unstoppable.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.468
Back when your dad played,

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
they were the champs,
not the chumps.

01:19.166 --> 01:23.300
Now, I know that you don't want
to spoil that legacy.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.793
I finally convinced
our lead sponsor

01:37.836 --> 01:40.360
to let me recruit
an outside player.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.406
A kid who knows
how to win games.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.277
You know me, I'll take
any help we can get.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.801
Who's the guy? A ringer?

01:45.844 --> 01:47.803
No, he's a farm kid
out of Duck Creek.

01:47.846 --> 01:51.285

Pure muscle, but fast.

01:51.937 --> 01:52.938
What's his name?

01:52.982 --> 01:54.114
Mantle.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.985
Reggie "The Blur" Mantle.

Went steady?

How would that work?

It's not like you can pin me

Yes, ma'am.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.737
What was that like?

04:19.781 --> 04:23.132
The farm's everything we have.
It's our family's legacy.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.961
My dad came home from the war
with a chunk of shrapnel

04:26.004 --> 04:29.530

so, it slowed him down.

your family's farm

Uh, well, I was talking
to Dr. Werthers.

05:43.734 --> 05:49.218
He wonders if it
might not be prudent
to get you exercising more.

05:49.261 --> 05:53.440
You know, to burn off
some of your excess energy.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.530
He doesn't want me to go back
on Riverdale Grandstand,
does he?

No, no, no, no.

temptations there.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.233
Hmm. Boys.

Well, he wondered if you...
If you might not fare better

with nice, decent girls.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.677
Hmm. Unlike Veronica.

Now, I've spoken
with Clifford Blossom,

Um, well, Dr. Werthers thinks,

06:26.734 --> 06:29.258
and your mother and I
both agree,

You figured out a good hustle.

You find these ripe cherries
knowing they're in the closet,

07:08.253 --> 07:11.039

a shelf life on them.

Going from town to town
and seeing up close

07:44.594 --> 07:46.988
what some people are
capable of doing?

07:48.511 --> 07:51.645
The inhumanity, the hatred.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.952
-The racial injustice.
-I can only imagine.

doing to keep busy?

but I'm a cheerleader.

Honestly, I haven't been
doing much writing lately.

Newly minted as of last night.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.341
Much to my chagrin,
might I add.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.736
And you now own the Babylonium.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.912
The paperwork was
finalized this morning.

08:41.956 --> 08:45.350

was a sportsman.

You might get a ticket
for speeding.

turn things around
for the Bulldogs.

turned my day around.

Where are you from?
What you do for kicks?

09:47.369 --> 09:49.763
And do you like the movies?

There isn't a theater
in Duck Creek.

we don't have a TV set.

to the Babylonium here in town.

It's a movie palace I own.

10:01.644 --> 10:05.866
I own my own business, yes.

in picking up some
part-time work,

I'm always on the hunt
for a few good men.

to excuse Veronica.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.135
Clearly, she was raised
by wolves.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.964
I appreciate
the, uh, invitation,

10:17.007 --> 10:20.141
but I'm just here
to play basketball
and win games.

who was supposed to help me

10:36.810 --> 10:38.942
keep track of my homework
from afar?

10:38.986 --> 10:41.466
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

10:41.510 --> 10:45.601
[sputters] Tabitha, I...
I got preoccupied. I...

10:45.645 --> 10:47.385
It's... It's okay.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.170
It was actually much
easier to coordinate

10:49.213 --> 10:51.476
with Principal Featherhead
than I anticipated.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.957
So you are hereby absolved.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.960
[sighs, chuckles]
Well, that's a relief.

10:57.004 --> 11:00.790
So, tell me,
why are you so preoccupied?

11:00.834 --> 11:02.487
Oh, I... I got a job.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.750
I'm writing comic books.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.143
Oh! How fun. What kind?

11:06.187 --> 11:08.929
It's a broad range,
but I also got to meet

11:08.972 --> 11:13.629
and start working
for a literary hero of mine,
Brad Rayberry.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.413
Oh, my gosh.
I know Brad Rayberry,

11:15.457 --> 11:18.199
I mean, not personally,
but I've read his books.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.983
His stories.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.506
You read science fiction?

11:21.550 --> 11:24.596
I read across all genres,
including science fiction.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.859
Say, would you want
to meet him?

11:27.425 --> 11:28.905
Would it be an imposition?

11:28.949 --> 11:30.211
No, no, not at all.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.170
It's, um... negative
perspiration.

11:33.214 --> 11:33.997
[both chuckle]

11:34.040 --> 11:35.216
I'm sure he would love it.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.175
Okay. Great.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.843
Don't tell me
you're here to see
Singin' in the Rainagain.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.540
I would think you'd have
the whole picture
memorized by now.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.543
I do, and I'm not. I...

11:58.587 --> 12:01.459
I'm actually here because
I wanted to see about
getting a job.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.723
At school, you mentioned
you were looking for...

12:03.766 --> 12:05.420
A few good men. Yes, I am.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.770
Since I called it quits
with the basketball team,

12:07.814 --> 12:12.775
I've been looking
for something to do,
and I love the movies.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.386
Well, that's my
biggest prerequisite.

12:16.910 --> 12:20.522
And you're already
pals with Clay.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.003
I am.

12:23.046 --> 12:26.441
Well, he's up
in the projection booth
even as we speak.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.748
But maybe you could
help me with something.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.141
Yeah, with what?

12:32.969 --> 12:35.145
Well, between us...

12:35.189 --> 12:40.672
I happen to think Clay is...
extremely dashing.

12:40.716 --> 12:44.111
I've been dropping hints
that I'm interested
in something

12:44.154 --> 12:47.505
more than a professional
relationship with him.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.117
But so far, no bites.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.683
Maybe you could help me

12:51.727 --> 12:53.033
suss him out a bit.

12:53.076 --> 12:56.384
Um, do you mean, like...

12:56.427 --> 12:59.561
Like is he
seeing anyone,
that sort of thing?

13:00.475 --> 13:01.868
Yeah, maybe.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.479
Well, in that case,
when can you start?

13:07.482 --> 13:09.571
[whistle blows]

13:09.614 --> 13:12.313
All right, you turkeys.
Bring it in.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.881
We have ourselves
a new player.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.884
His name is Reggie Mantle.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.146
So let's see what he can do.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.367
We are going to split up
into two teams.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.587
Julian, you're captain
of one team.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.632
Reggie, you've got the other.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.199
Everyone else, pick a side.

13:34.509 --> 13:35.858
Come on, guys.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.338
We can't have a game
if it's three against seven.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.345
We'll take Doiley too.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.650
That'll be enough.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.304
The water boy?

13:47.348 --> 13:48.610
[Reggie] Yeah.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.438
-[Julian] What is this, a gag?
-Can it, Julian.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.962
Dilton, you up for it?

13:55.443 --> 13:56.313
Well, come on.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.274
[upbeat music playing]

14:11.328 --> 14:12.852
[cheering]

14:16.507 --> 14:17.857
[boys gloating]

14:28.084 --> 14:29.390
[boy] Yeah!

14:42.490 --> 14:44.884
[Frank] Thirty-eight, all.
Anyone's game.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.458
[cheering]

14:54.937 --> 14:56.069
[grunts]

15:04.947 --> 15:06.296
Let's go. Game point.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.048
-[blows whistle]
-[cheering]

15:21.442 --> 15:22.356
Yes! Yes!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.316
[all cheering]

15:39.373 --> 15:42.158
Guys, how about we get
some burgers at Pop's?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.464
Reggie hasn't tried 'em yet.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.993
Come on. It's our
post-practice tradition.
What gives?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.342
Actually, I can't.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.865
I got a bunch of homework
to catch up on.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.606
No, Andrews, you're right.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.173
It is tradition.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.175
I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.742
Last one to Pop's treats.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.962
[Reggie scoffs]

16:04.137 --> 16:05.355
You can come too, pipsqueak.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.501
[Cheryl] Gather around, Vixens.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.894
Now that our team's roster
is finally complete,

16:22.938 --> 16:26.159
and with my family's first big
booster event coming up,

16:26.202 --> 16:29.989
it is time to assign each Vixen
to their respective player.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.165
Wait. What do you mean,
"assign"?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.254
It means that you show
your particular player

16:34.297 --> 16:36.517
extra-personalized support
throughout the season.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.040
Baking him cookies,
wearing his jersey,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.825
helping him with his homework.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.306
I, of course, will be paired
with Julian.

16:43.350 --> 16:47.876
And Toni, you and Archie
will be matched.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.748
As for our new star player,

16:50.792 --> 16:55.449
I was thinking Betty
could be with Reggie.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.713
[knocking at door]

17:09.854 --> 17:12.944
Maybe we leave him a note
and try again tomorrow?

17:12.988 --> 17:14.294
Yeah, that's a good idea.

17:15.730 --> 17:19.212
Hey, maybe we can
go catch a flick.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.910
I think the Babylonium
is playing It Came
from Beneath the Sea,

17:21.953 --> 17:24.086
and Ray Harryhausen
did the giant octopus.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
[chuckles] Oh, um...

17:27.089 --> 17:28.699
Yes.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.267
I would love to go
to the movies with you.

17:42.626 --> 17:43.758
[both chuckle]

17:45.847 --> 17:47.066
Toni.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.068
What's going on?

17:50.591 --> 17:53.246
We need to get real, Cheryl.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.943
What about?

17:54.986 --> 17:56.466
I can't do this anymore.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.165
The Vixens.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.515
Is this about being paired
with Archie?

18:01.558 --> 18:02.994
Would you prefer someone else?

18:03.038 --> 18:05.388
No. I don't want to get
paired with anyone.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.435
That's the thing.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.393
Baking for my own
personal meathead

18:10.437 --> 18:13.831
is not really what I want
my life to be about.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.791
This whole thing just
doesn't feel right anymore.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.663
It's not me
or who I want to be.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.491
A cheerleader.

18:22.623 --> 18:23.537
I see.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.932
Toni, this doesn't have
anything to do with me

18:27.976 --> 18:29.630
asking you to go steady,
does it?

18:30.935 --> 18:32.633
[Toni] No.

18:32.676 --> 18:37.028
But now that you mention it,
I'm not the settling-down type.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.119
And I feel like
I've lost myself.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.904
I don't know.
This whole square scene
isn't for me.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.688
I need to
figure myself out.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.996
I'm sorry, Cheryl.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.389
I just need some space.

18:56.744 --> 18:59.225
Can we do
a double-size popcorn,

18:59.268 --> 19:01.401
a large cola with extra ice,

19:01.444 --> 19:02.837
two packs of
the Senior Mints,

19:02.880 --> 19:05.535
a Butterflinger, a pack
of those Mint Bogos,

19:05.579 --> 19:07.494
Three Buccaneers
and a Skit-Skat?

19:07.537 --> 19:08.669
Do you want anything?

19:09.539 --> 19:12.499
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.327
That'll be 75 cents.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.417
[Clay] Here you go.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.115
Perfect.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.117
Keep the change.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.684
-Enjoy the movie.
-Thank you.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.906
Well, isn't that fascinating?

19:28.950 --> 19:30.821
[Clay] What?

19:30.865 --> 19:34.347
Jughead and Tabitha
going to the movies together?

19:35.739 --> 19:37.915
I find that interesting.
Don't you?

19:37.959 --> 19:40.266
Could be they both like
science fiction flicks.

19:42.137 --> 19:47.403
You know, Jughead and I
were entangled for
a New York minute.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.536
What happened?

19:49.579 --> 19:52.016
-I ended it.
-How come?

19:52.060 --> 19:52.887
He's plenty handsome.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.716
I suppose.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.849
But between you and me,
he's a total oddball.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.156
Lives in a train car too.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.551
I prefer my men to be
a bit more continental.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.510
Worldly.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.947
With an air of mystery
about them.

20:11.906 --> 20:16.650
I... I should skedaddle
to the booth.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.739
-Get the next reel cued up.
-[Veronica] Of course.

20:20.828 --> 20:21.698
But Clay...

20:23.265 --> 20:27.487
Just think about picking up
what I'm putting down.

20:37.497 --> 20:38.541
[door closes]

20:45.287 --> 20:47.768
Uh, what did you get
for problem four?

20:47.811 --> 20:49.770
You know, you don't
have to do this.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.296
What do you mean?

20:54.340 --> 20:57.952
Oh, helping you
with your homework
is one of my Vixen duties.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.041
I'm also supposed
to discreetly find out

21:00.084 --> 21:03.958
what your favorite
kind of cookie is,
so I can bake you a batch.

21:04.001 --> 21:07.266
-You don't have
to do that either.
-Oh, but I do.

21:07.309 --> 21:12.575
On the hush-hush.
It's sort of my
court-appointed punishment.

21:13.489 --> 21:14.969
What do you mean?

21:15.012 --> 21:16.797
Oh, I was ordered
to join the Vixens

21:16.840 --> 21:20.627
to curb my unhealthy
physical urges.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.284
Oh, you mean,
you haven't heard?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.068
[exhales deeply]

21:27.111 --> 21:30.941
Yeah, I sort of flashed
my underwear
on live television.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.292
You know,
like Marilyn Monroe style.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.077
Is that how come

21:36.120 --> 21:39.820
you and Archie have to have
your curtains closed?

21:41.430 --> 21:44.215
Oh, no... [sputters]

21:44.259 --> 21:45.652
Archie and I...

21:47.218 --> 21:50.352
Well, you'll probably
hear about it anyways.

21:50.396 --> 21:55.096
We were basically caught
having a peep show
in our windows.

21:55.836 --> 21:56.706
A peep show.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.667
Yeah, if you can
even call it that. [scoffs]

22:03.104 --> 22:04.323
You know what?

22:04.366 --> 22:07.717
I should...
I should probably go.

22:07.761 --> 22:10.677
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Nothing happened between us.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.027
We didn't. No, we're not...

22:13.070 --> 22:15.159
-I'm completely...
-[Reggie] Yeah.

22:15.203 --> 22:18.380
Still, I'm living with the guy.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.601
And we don't go in much
for peep shows

22:21.644 --> 22:23.516
and flashing panties
in Duck Creek.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.823
So, it's... This is...

22:29.086 --> 22:32.873
Consider yourself relieved
of your, uh, Vixen duties.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.962
-Okay?
-But I... I...

22:52.588 --> 22:55.635
Reg, you, uh... You want
to grab lunch with us?

22:55.678 --> 22:57.898
Thanks for the invite,
but I'm gonna pass.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.294
Well, it wouldn't be
with the team.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.122
It would be with
my other friends.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.386
All the same, I'm good.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.868
[basketball swishes]

23:11.912 --> 23:14.262
[Toni] I want to try
something out on you cats.

23:14.305 --> 23:17.744
Ever since Featherhead
refused to publish
my Emmett Till article

23:17.787 --> 23:19.833
in the Blue and Gold,

23:19.876 --> 23:23.750
I've been keen to start
a literary society for
Riverdale's Black students.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.926
A club that publishes
a journal

23:25.969 --> 23:29.799
focusing on Black voices
and writing.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.932
I think that's
an excellent idea.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.630
Yeah, I've been craving
a forum where
I can publish

23:34.674 --> 23:37.285
my literary criticism,
poetry and short fiction.

23:37.328 --> 23:41.332
And this is something that
you would do in addition
to cheerleading?

23:41.376 --> 23:43.900
No, I gave that up.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.729
What happened?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.862
I joined the Vixens
for the wrong reasons.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.214
It was because
I had a crush on a girl.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.869
Cheryl Blossom.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.611
But now that's over, so...

23:58.654 --> 24:01.396
Anyway, I think
publishing this journal

24:01.440 --> 24:04.268
could really make a difference
for the Black students
at Riverdale.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.706
It would. Definitely.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.534
But what happened with Cheryl?

24:08.577 --> 24:09.709
On the level,

24:09.752 --> 24:11.058
we're just so different.

24:11.101 --> 24:15.105
She's rich, she's white,
she's a Blossom.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.717
The whole thing,
it would just be impossible.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.937
I mean, it's hard
but it's not impossible.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.811
For Kevin and I,
we're also very different.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.944
So everything's a conversation.

24:27.988 --> 24:32.079
But he's up for getting
to know me and what
I'm all about, and vice versa.

24:32.122 --> 24:35.996
I hear that, Clay,
but you're also both preppies.

24:36.039 --> 24:39.216
So, at least you're starting
off on the same foot.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.131
Fair enough.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.482
I guess it all depends on
how much you like the person.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.665
Kevin, you haven't
seen Clay, have you?

24:52.708 --> 24:55.232
He's running late.
Had some stuff at school.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.147
Can we chat about something?

24:57.191 --> 24:58.540
Of course.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.107
[sputters] It's just, it...

25:00.150 --> 25:02.631
It seems like you're coming on
really strong with Clay.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.677
I might be.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.809
Clay would never say anything.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.724
But is that really appropriate?

25:08.768 --> 25:12.728
[clicks tongue] Oh, Kevin.
Don't be such a wet rag.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.863
What's wrong with a little
workplace flirtation?

25:18.299 --> 25:20.867
It's not like Clay
is even remotely interested.

25:20.910 --> 25:21.868
He's not.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.347
I know that for a fact.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.523
Oh.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.046
And why is that?

25:26.089 --> 25:28.918
Because he's not attracted
to assertive women?

25:28.962 --> 25:32.226
No, he's not attracted
to any women.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.011
Neither am I, for that matter.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.318
I knew it.

25:37.361 --> 25:40.147
I knew you were both
secret friends of Dorothy.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.192
You knew?

25:42.584 --> 25:43.672
How?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.892
You're both dreamy flutter bums

25:45.935 --> 25:50.592
who can quote every line
of Norma Desmond's dialogue
in Sunset Boulevard.

25:50.636 --> 25:53.726
If you knew,
why would you make
a play for Clay?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.728
To test my hypothesis,
of course.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.558
You lucky dog. He is a hunk.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.605
Say, what are the chances...

26:03.649 --> 26:05.781
Clay swings both ways?

26:05.825 --> 26:08.088
Uh, he doesn't. We don't.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.177
Double-checking, that's all.

26:10.220 --> 26:10.917
[chuckles softly]

26:10.960 --> 26:12.222
You're okay with this?

26:12.266 --> 26:13.833
Absolutely.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.749
Kevin, the only thing better
than having a hunky boyfriend

26:16.792 --> 26:19.621
is having hunky friends
who are boys.

26:19.665 --> 26:23.886
The thing is, I've always had
more fun going out
with Tony and Tab

26:23.930 --> 26:27.020
than, say, Steve and Dennis.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.633
Steve McQueen
and Dennis Hopper.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.940
Don't worry,
we'll get you up to snuff.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.769
[sighs]

26:36.812 --> 26:40.294
Oh, Kevin, I'm so excited.

26:40.337 --> 26:43.993
This hick town is finally
starting to feel like home.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.866
[giggles softly]

26:46.909 --> 26:48.911
[Frank] All right, fellas.
Huddle up.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.304
Julian has an announcement.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.655
Tomorrow night,

26:53.699 --> 26:56.963
my parents are hosting
their annual Bulldog booster
basketball mixer.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.878
This year,
it's also a fundraiser.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.706
To build us a new gym.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.359
Are the cheerleaders invited?

27:02.403 --> 27:03.709
Absolutely.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.624
So dress spiffy.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.277
Okay? Coats and ties.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.322
Make sure you shower.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.281
[clears throat]

27:13.327 --> 27:18.332
And, of course, we'll be
welcoming our newest Bulldog
to the family, I suppose.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.735
You know, that Blossom mixer
may sound a little stuffy,

27:29.778 --> 27:33.129
but they're always
a gas and a half.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.001
Yeah, well, let me know
how that goes.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.180
-You're not going?
-No, I can't be distracted.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.922
The NCAA is giving out
scholarships for college,

27:42.965 --> 27:46.055
and if I get one of those,
I'm made in the shade.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.105
Reggie, no man is an island.

27:52.148 --> 27:55.195
Can't you do all that stuff
and still cut loose a little?

27:55.238 --> 27:57.937
Hell, Julian made it seem like
you're the guest of honor.

27:57.980 --> 28:02.158
If that's what you heard,
you're a lot more naive
than I thought.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.772
Why are you being
such a killjoy, Mantle?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.165
Why can't you meet
anyone halfway?

28:09.209 --> 28:11.559
Meet halfway?

28:11.602 --> 28:15.041
Julian and those guys
haven't taken one step
towards me since I got here.

28:15.084 --> 28:19.175
And you haven't heard
anything I've been saying.

28:19.219 --> 28:22.744
Sophomore year, I was recruited
by Stonewall Prep.

28:22.788 --> 28:27.053
And I was juiced to be there,
but I never belonged there.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.055
And my teammates made that
very clear.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.841
[boy exclaims] Oh!

28:32.885 --> 28:34.625
You guys like rice,
don't you?

28:34.669 --> 28:37.237
Is that enough to take back
to your farm, yellow-belly?

28:37.280 --> 28:39.761
[boy laughing]

28:39.805 --> 28:41.589
[Reggie] And that was day one.

28:41.632 --> 28:45.593
During practice,
the other players
would foul me on purpose,

28:45.636 --> 28:47.334
and they did whatever
they could to run me
out of there.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.248
And guess what?

28:49.553 --> 28:51.120
It worked.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.427
So this time,
I'm not meeting
anyone halfway.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.213
Not giving anyone an opening.

28:59.128 --> 29:03.219
A chance to humiliate me
ever again.

29:04.873 --> 29:05.961
All right?

29:06.614 --> 29:07.789
All right.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.011
Reggie...

29:14.230 --> 29:15.754
I'm sorry that happened to you.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.975
But we're not like that here.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.282
Aren't you?

29:28.636 --> 29:30.159
[students laughing, chattering]

29:33.293 --> 29:34.120
Cheryl.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.906
Toni.

29:37.950 --> 29:41.910
-Hello.
-How are you?

29:41.954 --> 29:47.611
[exhales] I'm being stoic
and strong for the sake
of my Vixens.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.876
-How are you?
-Well, I'm petitioning
for a new club.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.226
And you,
as Junior Class President,

29:53.269 --> 29:56.359
are in charge of the student
council's financing.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.536
I was hoping you could help us
secure some funding.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.190
What kind of club is it?

30:01.234 --> 30:04.150
It's a literary society
for Riverdale's Black students

30:04.193 --> 30:06.848
to share their ideas,
stories and writings

30:06.892 --> 30:09.677
with each other
and the student body.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.506
A way to express ourselves
on our own terms.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.814
That's a really wonderful idea.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.467
I'll put the request
through today,

30:17.511 --> 30:21.297
but Toni, everything has to go
through Featherhead, so...

30:21.341 --> 30:22.908
I know.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.693
And I appreciate you trying.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.957
And if Featherhead
doesn't approve,
we'll make it work.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.263
We always do.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.831
Maybe a bake sale or something.

30:32.874 --> 30:36.225
Well, I would contribute
my legendary cherry scones.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.929
Toni, can I ask you a question?

30:47.541 --> 30:50.370
Is part of the reason
you broke up with me
because I'm white?

30:52.415 --> 30:55.244
There was a lot
of reasons, Cheryl.

30:55.288 --> 31:00.162
All interconnected,
but that was part of it.

31:00.771 --> 31:01.990
Yeah.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.343
I will try my absolute best
with Featherhead.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.563
I promise.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.442
-[jazz music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

31:44.119 --> 31:45.904
Fancy meeting you here.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.167
Well, howdy doody, Betty.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.386
And how's it going
being a paper shaker?

31:50.430 --> 31:52.084
Oh, swell.

31:52.127 --> 31:55.652
Werthers thought it would
help me burn off
some excess energy.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.045
Grown-ups don't have a clue.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.439
No, they don't.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.137
Anyways, I don't think I'll be
a Vixen for much longer.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.617
And why is that?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.706
Once my mother finds out
that I've been assigned

32:05.749 --> 32:10.102
a basketball player
to take care of,
she will flip her lid.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.457
[Archie] Oh, crap.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.243
Um, will you excuse me, Betty?

32:21.287 --> 32:23.811
-I...
-I'll take it.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.334
Thanks.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.422
[Betty chuckles softly]

32:28.947 --> 32:32.515
Archie. Your uncle's telling me
that you're sharing a room

32:32.559 --> 32:35.823
with our, uh...
Our secret weapon.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.564
Uh, you mean Reggie?

32:37.607 --> 32:38.957
Yes, I am.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.134
Well, as a former
Bulldog myself,

32:43.178 --> 32:45.485
I do appreciate the sacrifice.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.269
Well, it's no trouble at all.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.793
I'm cranked to do it, really.

32:49.837 --> 32:50.794
Well, I know I couldn't.

32:50.838 --> 32:53.232
I mean, bunking with, uh...

32:53.275 --> 32:55.974
We look upon him
as a necessary evil, Dennis.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.323
A means to an end.

32:57.366 --> 32:58.672
She's talking about winning.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.196
The Bulldogs must be
champions this year.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.677
The town needs something
to rally behind.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.853
And you know, Frank,
when you suggested

33:05.896 --> 33:07.986
bringing on a Korean prodigy...

33:08.029 --> 33:09.291
[chuckles]

33:09.335 --> 33:11.119
Well, I was skeptical.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.339
But having seen him play...
[exclaims]

33:13.382 --> 33:16.820
I now see how inspired
your thinking was.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.692
Tell me something, Archie.

33:18.735 --> 33:23.175
Does he, uh, actually
realize the opportunity

33:23.218 --> 33:24.698
we're presenting to him
and his family?

33:25.133 --> 33:27.222
He does.

33:27.266 --> 33:30.312
He just doesn't want
to fall behind on his...
On his schoolwork.

33:30.356 --> 33:33.533
Good for him. [chuckles]

33:33.576 --> 33:37.363
But, uh, well,
we don't care about that.

33:37.406 --> 33:39.539
We just need him
to be a loyal soldier

33:39.582 --> 33:42.542
and bring us
our championship trophy.

33:42.585 --> 33:46.850
He does that,
preferably with a smile
on his face,

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
there'll be no problems for us.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.203
And none for his family.

33:52.987 --> 33:55.207
If you'll excuse me.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.513
-I'm gonna get some fresh air.
-Yeah.

33:57.557 --> 33:58.471
Good stuff.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.694
Well, Coach,
here's to a winning season.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.479
[glasses clinking]

34:12.353 --> 34:14.094
[Veronica] Reggie Mantle.

34:14.139 --> 34:17.315
And here I thought
you weren't
a fan of the movies.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.405
I didn't say that.

34:19.447 --> 34:22.408
I said we didn't have
any theaters in Duck Creek.

34:22.451 --> 34:23.844
I stand corrected.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.107
And the fact that I might
have been here tonight

34:26.150 --> 34:29.676
didn't influence
your decision, I suppose?

34:29.719 --> 34:30.851
If I'm being honest...

34:30.893 --> 34:33.418
Oh, I insist upon honesty
at all times.

34:33.940 --> 34:35.420
Not at all.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.510
Truth is, I forgot
that you worked at this place.

34:37.553 --> 34:38.467
[chuckles]

34:39.338 --> 34:41.731
I don't work at it.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.123
I own it.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.172
Now, what can I get for you?
[clears throat]

34:48.216 --> 34:49.870
A small popcorn?

34:49.913 --> 34:51.871
No butter. I'm training.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.097
Here you go.

34:59.923 --> 35:00.837
On the house.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.101
Thanks.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.845
How rude can you get?

35:08.889 --> 35:11.239
Anyway, there's plenty
other fish in the sea.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.458
True.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.634
But take a powder,
Herman Melville,

35:14.677 --> 35:18.551
because that
is the real Moby Dick.

35:18.594 --> 35:21.597
[Tabitha] Wow, this is like
the Orient-Express.

35:21.641 --> 35:24.252
[Jughead chuckles]
That's exactly what I said.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.428
-Here you go. Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.127
Um, I actually,
I brought you something.

35:31.781 --> 35:32.739
Here.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.219
This is for you to keep.

35:34.262 --> 35:38.005
Darkwater: Voices from
Within the Veil,

35:38.048 --> 35:39.963
by W.E.B. Du Bois.

35:40.007 --> 35:44.925
-Du Bois. He is a sociologist
and a civil rights activist.
-Du Bois.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.840
He's also one
of my favorite authors.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.147
Wow, it's a great title.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.018
Which one should I start with?

35:51.061 --> 35:53.716
Well, we've established
that you're a fan
of science fiction.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.372
-Mm-hmm.
-And though it's more
speculative fiction,

35:57.416 --> 36:01.420
I would suggest a story
that Du Bois wrote
called The Comet.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.987
-What's that one about?
-Oh, it's fantastic.

36:04.031 --> 36:06.642
It's, um, it's about this comet
that hits New York City

36:06.686 --> 36:10.516
and it kills everybody
except for two people.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.735
A man named Jim
and a woman named Julia.

36:12.779 --> 36:18.611
And it's sort of about this
unlikely relationship that
develops between them.

36:18.654 --> 36:24.530
And what's really interesting
is that Jim is Black
and Julia is white,

36:24.573 --> 36:28.403
and it's sort of
one of the first times
an interracial relationship

36:28.447 --> 36:31.580
has been depicted
in science fiction.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.365
Well, it sounds terrific.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.105
-Yeah.
-I can't wait to read it.

36:35.149 --> 36:39.284
Actually, I was thinking
that maybe we could
read it together.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.895
Tonight. Aloud,
if you wanted.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.202
Yeah, that sounds swell.

36:47.857 --> 36:48.815
How was the mixer?

36:51.470 --> 36:54.647
It was dullsville.
Honestly, you didn't
miss out on much.

36:54.690 --> 36:57.127
Hmm. How were the cheerleaders?

36:57.171 --> 36:58.303
All dolled up?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.611
I don't really want
to talk about it.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.571
Hey, I'm gonna grab a shower.

37:16.930 --> 37:20.063
Okay, you lug nuts.

37:20.107 --> 37:24.546
Coach is in a meeting,
so I'm running warm-ups today.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.765
Everyone good with that?

37:27.462 --> 37:30.073
In that case, let's play ball.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.641
[upbeat music playing]

37:33.903 --> 37:34.861
[boys chattering]

37:40.910 --> 37:41.824
[grunting]

37:47.526 --> 37:48.744
[Archie] Yeah!

37:50.398 --> 37:51.486
[Julian] Come on.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.748
Hey, banana boy,
pass me the ball.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.272
Pass me the ball!

37:59.886 --> 38:01.366
[boys] Whoa!

38:02.497 --> 38:03.803
[boy] Man, come on.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.676
[panting] Listen up.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.810
We are not doing this crap.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.900
If you haven't noticed,

38:13.943 --> 38:16.946
Reggie here is our
strongest player,

38:16.990 --> 38:19.645
our only shot at making
the playoffs this year.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.821
So we're going to rise
to his level.

38:21.864 --> 38:26.304
So if you don't want
to be chummy with him,
that's fine.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.783
But the minute
we hit this court,

38:27.827 --> 38:30.525
we are teammates,
fighting for each other.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.659
If you can't get
on board with that,
the door's right there.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.490
And that includes
you too, Captain.

38:43.669 --> 38:47.499
I hope this will suffice.
Funds for your new club.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.457
Thank you, Cheryl.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.765
[chuckles] I'm shocked
Featherhead approved
a Black literary society.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.157
He didn't.

38:54.201 --> 38:57.726
Those funds were earmarked
for... something else.

38:57.770 --> 39:01.687
But I believe your club
to be a much more
worthy endeavor.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.645
Well, I won't ask
any more questions.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.039
But thank you.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.520
Of course.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.567
I look forward to reading
your first issue.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.005
Cheryl, wait.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.576
Yes?

39:21.620 --> 39:23.361
What are you doing
after cheerleading practice?

39:25.493 --> 39:27.974
No plans. Why?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.846
If you want,

39:30.890 --> 39:33.588
maybe we could meet
at the Dark Room.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.418
I would love that.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.334
Do you mean to talk?

39:40.378 --> 39:43.555
Yeah, about...

39:43.598 --> 39:47.646
what it would mean
if we tried again.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.612
I didn't sock Julian for you.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.226
I know you don't need saving.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.490
I did it for my own sake
and for the team's.

40:07.448 --> 40:10.103
I didn't want to believe
you were right about this town.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.935
But, hell,
maybe we are just as...

40:15.978 --> 40:17.937
As messed up
as any other place.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.462
I don't know. [chuckles softly]

40:33.343 --> 40:36.259
Want to grab a burger
at Pop's on the way home?

40:36.303 --> 40:38.610
Maybe we'll run into some
of the other fellows there.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.961
Sure, if you're sure.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.789
I am.

40:43.832 --> 40:46.269
Just don't expect me to sit
with anyone or anything.

40:46.313 --> 40:47.532
[laughs]

40:54.364 --> 40:56.279
[Jughead] Tabitha and I
stayed up till dawn,

40:56.323 --> 40:58.586
reading and discussing
Du Bois' stories.

40:58.630 --> 41:02.460
The next day, I wanted
to tell Mr. Rayberry
all about my swell night,

41:02.503 --> 41:04.287
so I went back
to his apartment.

41:04.331 --> 41:07.116
[door creaks]

41:08.814 --> 41:11.294
Wha... What happened?

41:11.338 --> 41:15.603
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Brad Rayberry is dead.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.518
Wha...

41:17.562 --> 41:19.259
[sputters] How did he die?

41:19.302 --> 41:20.826
He, uh, killed himself.

41:22.175 --> 41:24.003
Hung himself.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.700
He left a note.

41:25.744 --> 41:28.573
"I can no longer
continue living this way."

41:31.010 --> 41:33.621
I'm sorry, Jughead.
I know that he was your friend.
