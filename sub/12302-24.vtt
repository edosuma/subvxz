WEBVTT

00:47.961 --> 00:49.899
This can't be the right address.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.705
I just saw somebody walk in.

00:52.812 --> 00:54.349
Oh, and look...

00:54.721 --> 00:55.986
What about the cops ?

00:56.287 --> 00:57.683
What about them ?

01:10.782 --> 01:15.133
- Is this where the break-in club is ?
- This is gonna be great !

01:58.800 --> 02:02.462
I fronted your album. That means I pick
where you play. And I collect the cover.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.008
I don't need you anymore.

02:04.309 --> 02:06.405
Even found my own place.

02:06.970 --> 02:09.334
You don't get to freelance.
I still own you.

02:09.335 --> 02:10.216
Sorry.

02:11.035 --> 02:12.316
I can't hear you.

02:16.577 --> 02:17.735
You will.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.191
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?

02:32.340 --> 02:34.301
Hey, will you relax ?

02:47.778 --> 02:48.818
Three dead.

02:49.687 --> 02:50.837
15 injured.

02:51.431 --> 02:53.784
Who chose the location
for the party, John ?

02:53.785 --> 02:54.923
Nobody.

02:55.135 --> 02:56.808
At least nobody who's admitting to it.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.718
Ah, so we have a break-in party.

02:58.829 --> 02:59.964
It's the latest thing.

03:00.075 --> 03:01.902
Clubs don't want young
hip-hop DJs playing.

03:02.013 --> 03:04.241
- Too many fights.
- Yep.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.756
So a bunch of "independent
promoters" filled the void.

03:06.857 --> 03:08.252
Break into a space.

03:08.363 --> 03:09.100
Call it a club.

03:09.211 --> 03:12.875
No permits. No red tape.
Plenty of enemies, though.

03:12.876 --> 03:14.899
Kids here say this DJ was getting big.

03:15.010 --> 03:16.703
Thought he didn't need
his promoter anymore.

03:16.814 --> 03:18.927
Maybe his promoter felt otherwise.

03:21.521 --> 03:22.309
What do you see ?

03:22.420 --> 03:24.273
See this blast pattern, John ?

03:24.708 --> 03:27.715
It means the explosion
came from in there.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.054
Be right back.

03:43.507 --> 03:44.591
Hey, Alexx.

03:49.157 --> 03:50.103
Horatio ?

03:51.957 --> 03:52.911
What is it ?

03:53.249 --> 03:56.199
I found the seat of
detonation and something else.

03:58.244 --> 04:00.136
Another victim of the blast.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.517
Or the cause of it.

04:54.908 --> 04:57.238
Hey. Thanks for the
heads-up. I owe you one.

04:57.349 --> 04:58.828
You would have found out yourself.

04:58.939 --> 04:59.618
Maybe.

04:59.709 --> 05:02.208
But I was here before the other
news crews even got a whiff of it,

05:02.319 --> 05:03.140
thanks to you.

05:03.251 --> 05:05.263
Make it up to me sometime
when we're both not crazed.

05:05.374 --> 05:06.530
Ah. So never.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.891
Tell me what you told the officer.

05:18.012 --> 05:21.930
I was just talking to these
two girls. Then he showed up...

05:22.041 --> 05:24.331
and that's the last thing I remember.

05:24.442 --> 05:26.885
Witnesses say you got
into it with the DJ.

05:27.005 --> 05:28.306
I just came here to talk to him.

05:28.437 --> 05:29.262
That's all.

05:29.383 --> 05:31.053
Talk or threaten ?

05:31.550 --> 05:33.132
Depends on how well he listened.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.506
Look, man, I almost got killed, too.

05:35.617 --> 05:37.401
Yeah, but you didn't and he did.

05:37.522 --> 05:39.731
And you have no smoke or debris on you.

05:39.842 --> 05:40.808
What are you trying to say ?

05:40.919 --> 05:42.639
Maybe you were on your way out

05:42.749 --> 05:44.239
because you knew about the bomb.

05:45.281 --> 05:47.022
- Horatio ?
- Yeah ?

05:47.143 --> 05:48.503
You need to see this.

05:50.344 --> 05:51.309
You can go.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.444
You stay.

05:56.321 --> 05:57.374
What'd you get ?

05:57.485 --> 05:59.247
No person set off the bomb.

06:00.672 --> 06:01.618
This did.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.030
It's a mercury switch.

06:09.013 --> 06:11.446
All it takes is a strong
vibration to activate it.

06:11.557 --> 06:13.758
Liquid metal touches solid metal....

06:13.869 --> 06:14.625
...and good night.

06:14.736 --> 06:16.908
That means the detonation
was an accident.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.476
It was the music that set it off.

06:30.707 --> 06:32.613
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?!

06:47.531 --> 06:49.285
But if you use a mercury switch,

06:50.627 --> 06:52.311
why have an altimeter switch ?

06:55.397 --> 06:57.122
He was still experimenting.

06:57.423 --> 06:58.687
This was his workshop.

06:58.798 --> 07:03.055
The question becomes Ryan,
who was this bomb meant for ?

07:08.782 --> 07:11.374
Found several of these
pieces lodged in his back.

07:11.485 --> 07:12.957
Melted plastic.

07:13.068 --> 07:14.672
With some kind of wire inside.

07:14.783 --> 07:18.144
Yes, it's a frag from the blast.
I gonna need to take a look at that.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.796
But that's not the best part.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.105
A stab wound.

07:27.216 --> 07:28.501
Probably from a knife.

07:28.802 --> 07:31.376
Definitely before the explosion.

07:36.783 --> 07:39.096
And the reason the bomber
didn't stop the bomb.

07:39.697 --> 07:41.844
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?!

07:51.819 --> 07:53.056
Did they recover a knife ?

07:53.167 --> 07:54.301
Not yet.

07:55.619 --> 07:56.924
Calleigh.

07:58.248 --> 07:59.866
Maybe he left it at she scene.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.911
That's huge.

08:02.027 --> 08:03.668
Yeah, I'll certainly look for it.

08:47.384 --> 08:48.519
Something's missing.

09:16.450 --> 09:17.427
Did you see anyone ?

09:17.588 --> 09:19.852
Calleigh, what are you talking
about ? There's nobody out here.

09:24.065 --> 09:25.617
You wouldn't hold a gun
to my head, would you ?

09:27.042 --> 09:28.473
There's no one out here.

09:33.477 --> 09:35.006
Tox report on our bomber.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.512
Potassium iodide levels
are off the charts.

09:37.813 --> 09:40.439
Now, normally, that means
trouble with the thyroid.

09:40.761 --> 09:41.892
Our guy was healthy.

09:41.993 --> 09:45.271
Potassium iodide can be used
to counteract radioactivity.

09:45.382 --> 09:46.817
That's why I'm here in person.

09:46.928 --> 09:51.131
A bomber who was preparing to be in
contact with radioactive material.

09:51.252 --> 09:53.012
We're talking about a dirty bomb.

09:53.453 --> 09:56.326
Okay, I need to contact
HazMat immediately.

09:56.437 --> 09:58.638
Exposure to radiation leads to cancer...

09:58.749 --> 09:59.833
birth defects.

09:59.944 --> 10:00.961
Horatio...

10:01.514 --> 10:04.077
if I need to get my kids out
of town, you'll tell me, right ?

10:04.188 --> 10:06.526
As soon as I know,
you'll know, all right ?

10:06.727 --> 10:08.036
Thank you.

10:09.023 --> 10:11.077
Mr. Wolfe, were you at Trace ?

10:13.763 --> 10:16.127
Explosives used in the bombings was TNT.

10:16.238 --> 10:17.888
Used to disperse radiation.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.897
Right.

10:18.898 --> 10:21.693
So I talked to the military police
at every base in South Florida.

10:21.804 --> 10:22.734
We get anybody ?

10:22.845 --> 10:25.108
Yeah and he's waiting for you at MDPD.

10:25.229 --> 10:27.618
Nice going, Mr. Wolfe. Thank you.

10:28.930 --> 10:32.143
Your TNT got three people
killed yesterday, Staff Sergeant.

10:32.254 --> 10:33.442
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:33.553 --> 10:34.582
You work the bomb range.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.659
- That's right.
- Tuesdays, you demo TNT.

10:36.768 --> 10:37.412
That's right.

10:37.523 --> 10:39.252
Nobody used the range this week.

10:39.947 --> 10:42.155
So I have my days mixed up.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.488
Or maybe you sold the explosives
to cover your gambling debt.

10:45.489 --> 10:49.171
On Tuesday, you deposited
$40,000 into this account.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.780
And on Wednesday, you wire-transferred
it to a bookie in Costa Rica.

10:52.891 --> 10:55.314
If this is about military ordnance,
why am I talking to a civilian ?

10:55.315 --> 10:56.836
Because civilians got killed.

10:56.837 --> 10:59.721
So did the man who bought the
explosives. He was stabbed.

10:59.832 --> 11:01.226
I don't know anything about a stabbing.

11:01.337 --> 11:04.373
I took his money. I gave him
his three cases. That's it.

11:04.439 --> 11:05.596
Here's the bottom line, Sergeant:

11:05.691 --> 11:08.238
your gambling problem
got three people killed.

11:09.556 --> 11:10.606
Get him out of here.

11:15.469 --> 11:16.958
Three cases.

11:18.405 --> 11:18.899
What's up ?

11:18.975 --> 11:22.006
Three cases of TNT would've
done a lot more damage

11:22.086 --> 11:23.529
than what we saw, right ?

11:23.796 --> 11:25.690
So there's more out there ?

11:26.127 --> 11:28.499
And it's connected to
whoever stabbed the bomber.

11:46.609 --> 11:48.113
Did we get anything
off the knife ?

11:48.476 --> 11:49.546
DNA got the blood.

11:49.734 --> 11:51.407
Checking to see if
it matches our vic.

11:51.505 --> 11:52.916
What about prints, Eric ?

11:53.553 --> 11:55.319
Well, most of the time,
fire destroys them.

11:55.398 --> 11:56.230
But, uh

11:56.413 --> 11:58.339
conditions are right,
it can actually help.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.863
The heat bakes the print right in place.

12:11.427 --> 12:12.760
"Not authorized?"

12:14.121 --> 12:16.740
I'm gonna go check with Admin.
This must be a glitch.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.485
Agent Park.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.470
That was quick.

13:08.593 --> 13:10.627
Your little fingerprint search ?

13:10.727 --> 13:13.309
- Rattled nerves all the way to DC.
- What do you want ?

13:13.764 --> 13:16.577
Do you have any idea
how delicate this operation is ?

13:16.901 --> 13:18.329
We're looking for a handful of guys.

13:18.425 --> 13:20.240
One misstep, one hint we're onto them,

13:20.342 --> 13:21.425
and they go back down the rabbit hole.

13:21.521 --> 13:22.655
Come to the point, please.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.696
Raymond was great at selling local.

13:29.793 --> 13:33.051
He infiltrated a half-dozen
narco operations, mostly Colombian.

13:33.238 --> 13:34.771
Then he stumbled
onto something bigger.

13:34.868 --> 13:38.384
Someone, Agent, was selling
drugs to fund terrorism.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.459
We had no idea where
the money was going,

13:40.558 --> 13:42.337
- or what it was being used for.
- I can tell you.

13:42.724 --> 13:44.624
They're making dirty bombs.

13:46.057 --> 13:47.993
Your brother missed
his check-in call.

13:48.112 --> 13:50.441
As of 0900 today, he's in the wind.

13:50.571 --> 13:52.324
So that's why you're here.

13:52.425 --> 13:54.652
Thought he might contact you.
Doubt he trusted anyone else.

13:54.753 --> 13:55.947
How can I help ?

13:56.733 --> 13:58.837
Your brother's in danger, Horatio.

14:00.957 --> 14:01.994
Who put him there ?

14:03.256 --> 14:05.794
- Where the hell are you going to ?
- To clean up your mess.

14:21.257 --> 14:23.449
Twice in one day.
What, are you stalking me now ?

14:23.505 --> 14:24.861
No. In your dreams.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.477
Any leads yet on the Design
District explosion ?

14:27.517 --> 14:28.779
Nothing I can tell you.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.342
Uh, I got to go back
with something.

14:30.392 --> 14:32.161
Come on, Ryan, anything.

14:32.648 --> 14:34.034
I got nothing to give you.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.516
I got to get back to the lab.
I got to work up a tox panel

14:36.517 --> 14:37.509
on this morning's vic.

14:37.604 --> 14:38.997
Oh, chemistry. Sexy.

14:40.094 --> 14:43.267
I happen to think potassium
iodine testing is very sexy.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.163
So, if you'll excuse me.

14:54.148 --> 14:55.644
I'm sorry, boss.
I was just getting to that.

14:55.723 --> 14:57.196
This my plastic frag ?

14:57.410 --> 14:59.209
Yes, sir. From the
dead bomber's back.

14:59.344 --> 15:00.361
Okay.

15:02.648 --> 15:03.765
An LED.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.607
Light-emitting diode.

15:05.930 --> 15:07.294
Like inside your TV.

15:07.682 --> 15:09.985
Electric current causes
a discharge of photons.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.559
Take a look at this.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.975
Some kind of built-in motion sensor.

15:21.074 --> 15:22.828
Keeps the LED
completely self-contained.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.499
Not a component of the bomb,
but at the seat of detonation.

15:26.824 --> 15:27.956
I've seen these before.

15:28.322 --> 15:29.253
Club Freeze.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.992
They make a heck of a martini.

15:35.321 --> 15:37.787
John, Club Freeze. Thank you.

15:38.746 --> 15:40.000
You remember Matt Young.

15:40.101 --> 15:41.794
We picked him up at Club Freeze.

15:48.167 --> 15:50.046
Yes, you were at our
crime scene this morning.

15:50.146 --> 15:51.958
The break-in party ?
Yeah, you know that.

15:52.016 --> 15:54.197
But first you were
next door, weren't you ?

15:56.453 --> 15:57.680
Sounds like a party.

15:57.951 --> 15:59.178
Go check it out.

16:01.644 --> 16:02.240
So what ?

16:02.901 --> 16:04.036
Look what I found on him.

16:04.513 --> 16:05.383
A .38.

16:05.557 --> 16:06.746
I'm not breaking any laws.

16:06.801 --> 16:08.679
No, but that doesn't mean
you're not involved in that.

16:08.775 --> 16:11.312
Would you empty the contents
of your pockets, please ?

16:17.443 --> 16:18.254
That.

16:21.852 --> 16:23.734
Potassium iodide.

16:23.835 --> 16:25.104
I got a thyroid problem.

16:25.204 --> 16:27.291
Yes, just like your
friend Brandon Miller.

16:27.465 --> 16:28.644
We autopsied him.

16:28.753 --> 16:30.368
Wait inside with the officer.

16:48.076 --> 16:49.789
Everything okay ?

16:52.982 --> 16:55.136
I wish people would
stop asking me that.

16:59.831 --> 17:02.283
Calleigh, you had a gun
pointed at your head.

17:02.573 --> 17:04.401
You'd be pissed if
people weren't asking.

17:04.615 --> 17:06.000
I need to figure out
who was at the crime scene.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.717
They saw me notice the void.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.367
So there's a good chance
they took the evidence.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.768
The void looks like it's
about three by four inches.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.480
Have you, uh,
tried the booking photos ?

17:18.634 --> 17:19.294
I never saw him.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.300
So how are you gonna make an ID ?

17:24.147 --> 17:25.025
One click at a time.

17:33.008 --> 17:33.953
Too soft.

17:42.223 --> 17:43.795
It was more crisp than that.

17:46.604 --> 17:47.774
Too hollow.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.787
There were more clicks.

17:57.245 --> 17:59.035
There was more of a slapping sound.

18:01.573 --> 18:02.415
Wait.

18:02.969 --> 18:03.970
Do that again.

18:09.626 --> 18:10.161
That's it.

18:12.965 --> 18:13.833
It's a Ruger.

18:14.006 --> 18:15.531
GP-100.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.191
Ruger's a rarer gun.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.795
Has a transfer bar sort of rattles
around when it's cocked.

18:24.796 --> 18:27.400
Okay. So we got the gun.
How do we get the gunman ?

18:27.570 --> 18:29.781
I'm gonna run it through
the Automated Firearms System.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.872
What do you think the chances
are of the gun being registered ?

18:31.974 --> 18:33.005
Slim to none.

18:33.838 --> 18:35.106
But it's what I've got.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.163
You've got quite an interesting
story there, Mr. Young.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.776
Well, I'm happy to entertain.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.530
You come from a good family.

18:44.992 --> 18:46.865
They sent you
to the best schools.

18:46.947 --> 18:49.683
And yet you dropped out.
Why did you do that, Matt ?

18:49.986 --> 18:51.306
I had my reasons.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.983
And you travel.

18:53.407 --> 18:55.315
I understand
you spent quite a bit of time

18:55.315 --> 18:57.402
outside the country.
Where'd you go ?

18:57.656 --> 18:58.868
Here, there.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.777
I want to cut to the chase.
You were at the warehouse

19:01.868 --> 19:04.031
with Brandon testing bombs,
weren't you ?

19:04.131 --> 19:05.600
I don't know anything
about bombs.

19:05.691 --> 19:08.703
Do you have a grudge
against this country ?

19:11.179 --> 19:13.556
America's not a country,
Lieutenant.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.166
It's a corporation.

19:16.499 --> 19:18.239
It starts wars for profit,

19:18.335 --> 19:20.262
sacrifices people
for the bottom line.

19:20.262 --> 19:22.434
And you intend
to bankrupt that corporation.

19:22.806 --> 19:24.575
That's quite an accusation.

19:25.726 --> 19:28.021
Well, you've got
quite a plan, don't you ?

19:29.985 --> 19:30.876
Pretty lady.

19:31.106 --> 19:34.509
Uh, what's her name ?
Detective Salas, right ?

19:36.321 --> 19:38.782
In my opinion, she should
have taken her husband's name,

19:39.912 --> 19:40.500
you know ?

19:40.741 --> 19:41.658
Same as the son.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.438
- Yelina ?
- What's up ?

19:45.530 --> 19:46.833
Where's the boy.
Where's Ray, Junior ?

19:46.933 --> 19:47.891
- Right now ?
- Yeah.

19:48.372 --> 19:50.583
- At my mom's. Why ?
- Okay. Call her, please.

20:07.656 --> 20:09.206
She said he never showed up.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.596
Okay. Where else could he be ?

20:13.916 --> 20:16.358
Soccer practice has been
over for two hours. All right,

20:16.459 --> 20:17.992
Horatio, what is going on ?

20:18.424 --> 20:20.699
Ray is out there, and
there are people after him.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.570
They may be after you
and the boy, too.

20:31.001 --> 20:31.686
I'm going after him.

20:31.686 --> 20:34.289
- I want you to stay...
- No, I am not staying here.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.731
My son is in danger.

20:35.826 --> 20:38.144
And I am not going
to go into hiding.

20:38.146 --> 20:40.066
Could make matters worse.
I'll find him.

21:01.416 --> 21:04.159
- Raymond ?
- Horatio,

21:05.185 --> 21:06.992
you're the only one I can trust.

21:08.862 --> 21:09.447
Hang on.

21:10.061 --> 21:10.561
John.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.258
Thought you'd want to know,
that Matt Young character

21:12.258 --> 21:13.269
gave our guys the slip.

21:13.371 --> 21:14.508
You get his address ?

21:14.508 --> 21:16.472
I'm headed there now.
Second and Flagler.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.724
Okay, I'll meet you there.

21:22.023 --> 21:23.725
We can't talk here, Raymond.

21:34.012 --> 21:36.022
How does a man allow his wife and son

21:36.122 --> 21:37.630
to believe he's dead, Raymond ?

21:38.495 --> 21:39.866
When he's got no
other choice, Horatio.

21:39.875 --> 21:42.588
I begged you not to work
Narcotics, didn't I ?

21:42.994 --> 21:45.610
Feds had me dirty on tape.
They made me an ultimatum.

21:45.610 --> 21:47.818
Let's see, how does it work ?
You fake your own death,

21:47.918 --> 21:50.337
you join them, and you avoid
prosecution. It's not...

21:50.437 --> 21:52.875
They embedded me in a drug ring that
was doing a lot more than dealing.

21:52.875 --> 21:53.962
That's exactly right, Raymond.

21:53.971 --> 21:55.460
They're making dirty bombs.

21:59.865 --> 22:01.692
Big brother still
knows more than me.

22:02.126 --> 22:04.239
Tell me why you killed the bomber.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.123
Because he made me.

22:06.397 --> 22:08.686
And I was worried he was going
to go after my family.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.440
I'm not telling you squat.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.049
You ask too many questions.

22:12.148 --> 22:13.119
I'm just trying to get it right.

22:13.119 --> 22:15.878
I know that you're a cop,
and that you got a kid.

22:15.978 --> 22:19.258
So you're not gonna mess up
everything we've worked for.

22:25.694 --> 22:26.754
Neither are you.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.726
Well, it didn't work

22:28.827 --> 22:30.306
'cause they have Ray, Junior.

22:31.598 --> 22:32.197
What ?

22:34.096 --> 22:35.623
Tell me about the bomb.

22:36.551 --> 22:38.007
Uh, Ray Junior's
all I care about right now.

22:38.007 --> 22:40.805
Raymond, there's a way out of this,
but you got to work with me.

22:43.341 --> 22:44.323
Yeah, I'm listening.

22:56.087 --> 22:57.652
Guy's name's Matt Young.

22:57.912 --> 22:59.528
Moved out this afternoon.

22:59.789 --> 23:01.723
I tried to give him
his security deposit.

23:01.824 --> 23:02.975
Wasn't interested.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.234
Is this the guy ?

23:06.865 --> 23:09.320
He's a meteorology
student, I think.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.276
Moved here from Salt Lake.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.243
I got his license plate though.

23:13.343 --> 23:14.367
We're going to need that.

23:14.466 --> 23:15.256
Of course.

23:18.641 --> 23:19.941
You can take what you want.

23:20.055 --> 23:21.520
Then the rest is mine.

23:21.720 --> 23:22.590
You got a deal.

23:26.397 --> 23:27.847
Matt left in a hurry.

23:28.879 --> 23:30.133
Yes, he did.

23:30.803 --> 23:32.090
You got something ?

23:32.252 --> 23:34.009
It's a soccer schedule.

23:37.432 --> 23:38.408
Hey, Horatio,

23:40.025 --> 23:41.001
look at this.

23:43.076 --> 23:44.365
It's numeric code.

23:44.813 --> 23:46.245
Looks like minutes and seconds.

23:46.348 --> 23:47.561
Could be a...

23:48.347 --> 23:49.578
could be a deadline.

23:53.277 --> 23:55.341
So I got this license plate
number for you.

23:55.483 --> 23:57.648
Kid was renting
a Cadillac Escalade.

23:57.872 --> 23:58.548
Thank you.

23:59.513 --> 24:01.153
Means he's got ONSTAR.

24:01.325 --> 24:02.750
Means we've got a location.

24:02.932 --> 24:04.661
John, I'm going
to take it from here.

24:13.377 --> 24:15.854
Ever since Ray died, you treat me
like I don't know what I'm doing.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.772
This is about to get messy.
You deserve to walk away clean.

24:18.872 --> 24:19.974
So walk away.

24:21.187 --> 24:21.773
Brother...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.428
I'll never be clean.

24:28.031 --> 24:28.962
Hey, John.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.270
That's not true.

24:38.596 --> 24:39.600
I'll see ya.

24:50.048 --> 24:51.380
Yeah, this is Horatio Caine.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.813
Listen, I have a vehicle description.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.939
I need the ONSTAR coordinates.

25:16.234 --> 25:17.042
Take me.

25:17.155 --> 25:19.038
- Take me for the boy.
- Not going to happen.

25:19.140 --> 25:20.713
Even trade, please.

25:20.815 --> 25:22.603
Why don't you stand over here by him.

25:22.697 --> 25:24.176
He's just a kid, man !

25:24.665 --> 25:26.726
I don't care if he's just a kid.

25:34.137 --> 25:35.279
Get down, Ray.

25:40.933 --> 25:41.733
Down, son.

25:52.812 --> 25:53.451
Okay, Ray.

25:54.570 --> 25:55.575
Here we go.

25:55.786 --> 25:56.727
Here's what I want you to do.

25:56.821 --> 25:58.115
Right out there is the Hummer.

25:58.212 --> 26:00.228
Run to the Hummer
and don't look back.

26:11.666 --> 26:13.608
<i>Residents are fleeing greater Miami.</i>

26:13.825 --> 26:15.515
<i>All the main roads are clogged.</i>

26:15.708 --> 26:17.992
<i>Motorists are being
asked to remain calm.</i>

26:18.209 --> 26:20.407
<i>There have been reports
of road rage and chaos</i>

26:20.407 --> 26:21.677
<i>among some motorists.</i>

26:22.206 --> 26:22.677
Hey.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.331
Hey, what's going on ?

26:25.750 --> 26:26.620
Check it out.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.308
<i>CBS 4 News has learned
that Miami Dade police</i>

26:29.401 --> 26:32.517
<i>may have uncovered a plan to
detonate radioactive dirty bombs</i>

26:32.615 --> 26:34.071
<i>in the city of Miami.</i>

26:34.673 --> 26:36.748
<i>Sources close to the
investigation have confirmed</i>

26:36.840 --> 26:38.747
<i>that one victim in
last night's explosion</i>

26:38.839 --> 26:41.005
<i>may actually be tied
to the terror plot.</i>

26:41.217 --> 26:42.686
Sources ? Come on.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.148
What sources ?

26:44.215 --> 26:46.536
<i>The victim had been taking
potassium iodide--</i>

26:46.762 --> 26:49.945
<i>a medication to stave off the
effects of radiation poisoning.</i>

26:50.035 --> 26:51.574
How did they get
the tox results ?

26:51.670 --> 26:53.040
Had to be the ME's office.

26:53.136 --> 26:54.896
They've got more
leaks than the Titanic.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.763
<i>We'll stay on top
of this breaking story</i>

26:56.857 --> 26:58.335
<i>with our exclusive updates.</i>

26:58.441 --> 27:00.743
<i>Erica Sikes, CBS 4 News.</i>

27:01.156 --> 27:02.129
See that ?

27:02.272 --> 27:04.036
That's why the city's in panic.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.240
What I want to know--
I want to know how this got out.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.706
Saw you talking to her.

27:08.786 --> 27:10.146
All I told her was no comment.

27:10.249 --> 27:11.745
Said a lot for no comment.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.060
I didn't mean it.

27:18.685 --> 27:21.001
Whether you meant it
or not, you're the leak.

27:28.184 --> 27:31.685
<i>Interstate 95 is jammed out
of the downtown area</i>

27:31.785 --> 27:35.690
<i>as well has Highway 836
due to heavy evacuation traffic.</i>

27:35.797 --> 27:37.842
<i>We'll have more
evacuation updates</i>

27:48.399 --> 27:51.110
Just put the evidence on
my bench. I'll sign for it later.

27:52.937 --> 27:53.668
Calleigh.

27:55.177 --> 27:55.847
Hi, John.

27:57.072 --> 27:58.486
I was hoping we could talk.

28:00.084 --> 28:00.898
What do you need ?

28:02.377 --> 28:04.142
You're better with guns than I am.

28:04.570 --> 28:05.683
It's my job.

28:06.214 --> 28:07.838
It's why I became a criminalist.

28:10.617 --> 28:12.093
You know why I became a cop ?

28:15.328 --> 28:16.505
To help people.

28:18.101 --> 28:19.546
Be someone's hero.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.638
I think that's a good reason.

28:25.083 --> 28:25.731
Yeah.

28:28.244 --> 28:30.252
Only I haven't felt like one lately.

28:33.069 --> 28:34.705
You've been through a lot, John.

28:34.805 --> 28:36.134
You'll bounce back.

28:46.149 --> 28:49.476
I feel like I'll never live down
being the partner of a dirty cop.

28:50.608 --> 28:51.984
People are going to forget.

28:52.082 --> 28:53.746
I think about Ray all the time.

28:55.147 --> 28:56.638
Every time I see Horatio.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.077
Every time I come here.

28:58.917 --> 29:01.551
Everybody knows that
you're a great detective, John.

29:02.787 --> 29:03.544
Do you ?

29:06.341 --> 29:07.911
I know how hard you work.

29:10.566 --> 29:12.693
I would really love to be
friends with you, John.

29:19.078 --> 29:21.348
The harshest thing
a woman can say to a man.

29:24.046 --> 29:25.455
Look, why don't I
pack up the evidence

29:25.552 --> 29:27.873
and we'll go grab a cup of
coffee in the break room.

29:30.152 --> 29:31.479
I just need a minute.

30:36.972 --> 30:38.202
She won't go.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.093
She can't work it.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.192
She knows that.

30:46.449 --> 30:48.168
You try telling her, Eric.

30:48.565 --> 30:51.248
Either way, I've got
to get Hagen's body out.

30:52.495 --> 30:53.584
All right.

31:03.902 --> 31:06.165
Calleigh, I'm really sorry
this happened here.

31:07.919 --> 31:10.846
Why don't we go have
a cup of coffee or something.

31:15.752 --> 31:17.295
It should be my case.

31:17.393 --> 31:18.830
You know it doesn't work like that.

31:18.930 --> 31:20.202
You're a material witness.

31:20.277 --> 31:22.536
Then put Camden on it
from nights. He's solid.

31:22.658 --> 31:23.169
Okay.

31:23.332 --> 31:25.043
Keep you informed every step.

31:25.588 --> 31:26.303
Come on.

31:27.322 --> 31:29.935
I've got 12 open cases.
I need to get back in there.

31:38.996 --> 31:39.844
Wait.

31:45.484 --> 31:46.566
Calleigh.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.930
Honey, let him go.

31:49.789 --> 31:51.360
There's something in his jacket.

32:11.136 --> 32:12.478
It's our dead bomber.

32:14.335 --> 32:15.894
Some sort of weather report.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.502
Smoke-damaged.

32:18.693 --> 32:20.408
It's what made the void.

32:23.166 --> 32:25.190
John took it from the bomb scene.

32:32.125 --> 32:33.716
I guess that's why he put
the gun to my head.

32:33.816 --> 32:35.233
He was afraid I'd see him.

32:49.528 --> 32:50.244
That's crazy.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.044
Why would Hagen take a piece of
evidence from his own case ?

32:57.329 --> 33:00.042
Because the right piece of
evidence can make you a hero.

33:01.141 --> 33:03.111
He just couldn't put it in context.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.044
And he couldn't put it back.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.187
I guess he felt like
he'd run out of options.

33:18.362 --> 33:20.141
It's a Skew T diagram.

33:20.304 --> 33:21.391
Basically,

33:21.545 --> 33:23.965
today's weather forecast,
indicating temperature,

33:24.071 --> 33:25.251
dew point and wind speed.

33:25.550 --> 33:26.374
Wait a second.

33:27.157 --> 33:28.271
Wind speed?

33:29.636 --> 33:31.269
So they're planning
to spread the radiation

33:31.269 --> 33:32.954
throughout a large area,
aren't they?

33:33.019 --> 33:35.368
We recovered an altimeter
switch at the bomb scene.

33:39.812 --> 33:41.812
And that means they're
going to detonate

33:41.937 --> 33:43.612
at 800 feet in the air.

33:43.612 --> 33:45.687
How are we going
to determine where ?

33:45.790 --> 33:47.132
Here's how.

33:47.930 --> 33:48.613
Tyler,

33:49.025 --> 33:51.146
these numbers. I found them
in the bomber's apartment.

33:51.265 --> 33:52.317
What do they mean ?

33:53.808 --> 33:54.943
Latitude and longitude.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.275
Maybe the location.

33:59.939 --> 34:01.441
There you have it,
Carrillo Park,

34:01.444 --> 34:02.919
right in the middle of downtown.

34:03.009 --> 34:05.522
Tyler, what time are the
perfect conditions for this ?

34:08.855 --> 34:09.454
4:00 p.m.

34:09.454 --> 34:10.483
What time is it now ?

34:10.545 --> 34:11.686
3:45.

34:46.547 --> 34:47.547
Hugh !

35:44.135 --> 35:44.897
All clear.

35:45.015 --> 35:46.597
Move the HazMat team now.

36:05.131 --> 36:06.113
Hey.

36:09.997 --> 36:11.802
I just spoke to my son.

36:13.150 --> 36:15.018
Patrol's bringing him to me.

36:16.313 --> 36:19.246
They used him to flush out
his dad. It worked.

36:22.134 --> 36:23.333
And Raymond ?

36:29.727 --> 36:32.090
It's just too much to process.

36:34.966 --> 36:35.914
You know what ?

36:37.933 --> 36:38.887
You...

36:40.335 --> 36:41.965
You deserve some time off.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.554
You deserve it as much as I do.

36:55.011 --> 36:56.329
I agree.

37:01.326 --> 37:02.581
- Brazil.
- Hum.

37:08.470 --> 37:09.862
Do we still have time to pack ?

37:09.874 --> 37:10.552
No.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.506
Buy everything there.

37:12.997 --> 37:13.734
Ready ?

38:29.651 --> 38:32.838
<i>Officers intercepted
the suspect in downtown Miami.</i>

38:33.112 --> 38:35.654
<i>The suspect was killed
after he shot at the officers.</i>

38:35.891 --> 38:38.246
<i>By acting fast, we were able
to neutralize the threat</i>

38:38.367 --> 38:39.656
<i>before anyone was harmed.</i>

38:39.858 --> 38:41.759
<i>What was your part
in breaking the plot ?</i>

38:42.328 --> 38:45.819
<i>Uh, I was just
a cog in the wheel.</i>

38:47.856 --> 38:49.995
<i>My coworkers saved
countless lives today.</i>

38:50.106 --> 38:51.214
<i>They're, huh...</i>

38:51.306 --> 38:52.714
<i>They're amazing.</i>

39:56.024 --> 39:57.145
You're not coming.

39:57.269 --> 39:58.473
You won't be alone.

40:05.730 --> 40:06.740
Dad !

40:13.148 --> 40:13.952
How?

40:16.706 --> 40:17.492
Hey, Ray ?

40:21.687 --> 40:22.473
You okay ?

40:25.700 --> 40:28.566
You better disappear. Somebody
sees you, all bets are off.

40:28.726 --> 40:29.370
Yeah.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.843
It's the only way.

40:38.421 --> 40:39.909
You could have told me.

40:40.211 --> 40:41.387
There wasn't time.

41:03.740 --> 41:04.741
Thank you.

41:05.627 --> 41:06.791
You better go.

41:07.127 --> 41:07.951
Okay ?

41:08.096 --> 41:09.309
Now you take care.

41:09.709 --> 41:10.609
All right.

41:15.129 --> 41:16.949
I don't know what to say to him.

41:18.345 --> 41:19.590
You'll think of something.
