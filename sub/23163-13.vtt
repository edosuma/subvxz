00:00.001 --> 00:03.368
You basically love this man and you
want me to prove he has feet of clay?

00:03.393 --> 00:06.556
I want more than anything in the
world for you to prove that I'm wrong.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.368
This $100 bill that dropped
out of the flower box

00:11.445 --> 00:12.844
that Hayes was trying
to give you.

00:12.914 --> 00:14.211
Case dismissed.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.172
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.309
It's not liberal conduct.
That's misconduct.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.355
<i>Do you have some kind of hard
evidence against me, counselor?</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:22.946
Something that will stand up
in court?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.457
Why is he doing this?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.016
I'm not gonna insult Ice Pick by
talking to him about this stuff.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.154
You are unless you want him to end up
in jail for a murder he didn't commit.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.315
<i>It was January 23, 1958.</i>

02:04.792 --> 02:07.761
<i>I was 12 years old, and my
kid sister Wendy was five.</i>

02:08.628 --> 02:11.120
<i>My mom and dad had just been
killed in an automobile accident,</i>

02:11.198 --> 02:12.893
<i>and my aunts and uncles
were all arguing</i>

02:12.967 --> 02:16.027
<i>about who was gonna have to
take care of Wendy and me.</i>

02:16.103 --> 02:19.630
<i>Well, any other kid probably
would've been scared, but I wasn't.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:22.107
<i>I knew Mom and Dad would've
been happy wherever they were,</i>

02:22.176 --> 02:24.303
<i>as long as they were together.</i>

02:24.378 --> 02:27.211
<i>I knew Wendy and I would
be okay wherever we were,</i>

02:27.615 --> 02:29.708
<i>as long as we were together.</i>

02:29.784 --> 02:32.651
<i>But the one thing that I
couldn't stop thinking about</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:34.312
<i>was how, if I was somebody,</i>

02:34.388 --> 02:37.152
<i>I could have afforded to get
some flowers for the funeral.</i>

02:37.224 --> 02:39.590
<i>Boy, I wanted to give them
some flowers.</i>

03:16.731 --> 03:19.564
How you doing? You okay?

03:22.236 --> 03:23.828
You take care of your sister.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.550
Who's that man?

03:37.618 --> 03:41.019
Francis Hofstetler.
They call him Ice Pick.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.258
Ice Pick.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.090
<i>Something like that,
you never forget.</i>

03:49.263 --> 03:52.289
<i>He was true to his word, too. He came
by every Easter and Christmas, and...</i>

03:52.366 --> 03:54.300
And never forgot your birthday.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.393
Or Wendy's.
And when I was 14...

03:56.470 --> 03:59.268
He pulled strings to get
you into military school.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.467
Guess I told you guys
that story before.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.977
A couple of times.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.137
<i>Hey, the guy was like my father.</i>

04:07.214 --> 04:10.445
You don't have to explain why you
want to throw him a big birthday party.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.542
I think it's a great idea.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.643
<i>Yeah, so do I.</i>

04:12.720 --> 04:15.188
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.587
<i>The board of directors
are meeting at noon,</i>

04:16.656 --> 04:19.125
and the room hasn't been
set up yet.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.125
I've gotta call
my friend in Maine

04:23.197 --> 04:24.960
about shipping
the live lobsters.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.133
I don't recall adding Maine
lobster to the Club's menu.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.762
I'm late. I gotta meet Carol at
the courthouse in half an hour.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.998
What is going on?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.166
Are you gonna testify again?

04:35.242 --> 04:38.575
No. She just had this case
she wanted me to observe.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.204
<i>There is definitely
something going on here,</i>

04:40.281 --> 04:42.146
and I will not rest until
I get to the bottom of it.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.308
<i>Well, you know Carol.</i>

04:43.384 --> 04:45.716
<i>She probably has this dazzling
defense she wants to show off,</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:47.811
and I was the only person
she could think of to impress.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.288
<i>I'll be tied up all day,
probably.</i>

05:00.968 --> 05:02.230
Case dismissed.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.563
<i>But, Your Honor...</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:06.629
The defendant
is released from custody.

05:07.108 --> 05:08.097
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

05:08.175 --> 05:10.006
<i>Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?</i>

05:10.077 --> 05:13.911
I would suggest that your time would be
better spent approaching a law library.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.746
Perhaps there
you can acquaint yourself

05:15.816 --> 05:17.579
<i>with Article IV
of the Bill of Rights,</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:21.143
which protects us all against
unlawful search and seizure.

05:21.222 --> 05:24.123
<i>Your Honor, I am very well
acquainted with the Bill of Rights.</i>

05:24.191 --> 05:25.988
Court is recessed till 2:00.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.085
All rise.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.232
<i>Better luck next time, Carol.</i>

05:58.092 --> 06:00.287
KO'ed on a technicality?

06:00.528 --> 06:01.552
Hmm?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.829
<i>Oh, that. Yeah.</i>

06:04.365 --> 06:06.265
<i>Well, you win some,
you lose some.</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:08.190
Lunch?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.726
What?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.662
<i>Well, there's no point
in you making the trip</i>

06:11.739 --> 06:13.468
all the way downtown
for nothing.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.442
<i>Oh, no, no. Thanks anyway.</i>

06:17.645 --> 06:19.738
Are you too busy for lunch?

06:20.214 --> 06:22.842
<i>No offense, Carol,
but I know you.</i>

06:23.184 --> 06:26.381
<i>Now, you're gonna spend
the entire lunch hour</i>

06:26.453 --> 06:28.944
talking about the judge
and how incompetent he is

06:29.023 --> 06:31.457
and how some
obviously guilty defendant

06:31.525 --> 06:33.254
shouldn't get off
on a lousy technicality.

06:33.327 --> 06:36.296
<i>And you're right, you're
100ยบ/ยบ right. I agree with you.</i>

06:37.298 --> 06:40.290
<i>But I'm sorry, I'm just not
in the mood today.</i>

06:44.038 --> 06:47.997
This is the fourth case of mine
that he has dismissed in two months.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.975
<i>Well, sometimes
you get on a losing streak.</i>

06:50.044 --> 06:51.136
Over nothing?

06:51.212 --> 06:53.077
He wouldn't even let me
present my case.

06:53.147 --> 06:56.878
<i>Well, I'm not saying that he's
been fair with you. I just...</i>

06:56.951 --> 07:01.479
<i>Maybe could you consider that
in these four cases, that you,</i>

07:01.822 --> 07:06.259
<i>you know, might possibly have
not had that strong a case?</i>

07:07.161 --> 07:08.856
Could you consider that?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.260
No.
No.

07:10.331 --> 07:12.231
I have considered that.
That's not it.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.790
You don't think I would have asked
you to come all the way down here

07:14.868 --> 07:16.301
just to see
if I did my homework?

07:16.370 --> 07:19.362
Why did you ask me
to come down here?

07:19.440 --> 07:22.671
<i>Thomas, if it weren't for Hannibal,
I wouldn't even be a lawyer.</i>

07:22.743 --> 07:24.438
Wait a minute. You lost me.

07:24.511 --> 07:25.944
What does some guy
crossing the Alps

07:26.013 --> 07:27.207
have to do
with you becoming a lawyer?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.771
<i>No, no, no, not that Hannibal.</i>

07:28.849 --> 07:31.181
Hannibal Kearns. Judge Kearns.

07:31.252 --> 07:35.416
<i>He was a tough teacher,
but, oh, he was good.</i>

07:35.489 --> 07:38.253
<i>He was fair and honest,
somebody to look up to.</i>

07:38.325 --> 07:39.758
And now I don't know.

07:39.827 --> 07:43.729
<i>Lately he's been spending
more money than he makes,</i>

07:43.797 --> 07:46.925
<i>he's throwing out cases he would've
never dismissed in the past,</i>

07:47.001 --> 07:50.164
and he will not talk to me.
I don't know what to think.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.570
<i>Well, you might think that he
made a killing in the stock market,</i>

07:53.641 --> 07:55.632
<i>he suddenly developed
a liberal streak,</i>

07:55.709 --> 07:57.176
and he's run out of small talk.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.805
Any judge that shuts the door on
the prosecuting attorney's office

08:00.881 --> 08:03.441
before we even have a chance
to present our case...

08:03.517 --> 08:05.781
It's not liberal conduct.
That's misconduct.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.287
<i>Well, have you gone to the Review
Board or the Ethics Committee?</i>

08:08.355 --> 08:09.515
No.
No.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.115
<i>Well, because I don't have
any proof.</i>

08:12.793 --> 08:15.091
<i>Maybe that's why I asked
you to come down here,</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:19.565
<i>because I thought if you would
just follow him around, maybe...</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:22.096
Wait a minute.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.703
<i>Now, what you're saying is that
you basically love this man,</i>

08:26.774 --> 08:28.605
and you want me to prove
he has feet of clay?

08:28.676 --> 08:29.700
No.

08:29.777 --> 08:33.440
I want more than anything in the
world for you to prove that I'm wrong.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.018
I just can't figure out
why he would be taking money.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.783
He certainly has
a well-paying job.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.919
<i>What's a nine-letter word for
"completeness," second letter, "N"?</i>

08:50.364 --> 08:51.490
Oneness.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.029
That's only seven letters.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.336
His house is paid for.

09:01.175 --> 09:02.472
Here we go.

09:08.082 --> 09:10.482
Be careful.
Don't let him see you.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.210
I have done this a few times.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.111
Sorry.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.618
<i>Ordinarily I'd consider
an all-day surveillance</i>

09:19.693 --> 09:22.025
<i>a dull way to spend a Saturday,</i>

09:22.096 --> 09:23.529
<i>but there was a very good reason</i>

09:23.597 --> 09:25.622
<i>to spend a day
watching Judge Kearns,</i>

09:25.699 --> 09:28.190
<i>and it had to do
with General Grant.</i>

09:28.268 --> 09:30.964
<i>He was my high school coach,
and he wasn't really a general.</i>

09:31.038 --> 09:34.906
<i>He was a retired Marine
colonel. Warren McKenzie Grant.</i>

09:34.975 --> 09:38.001
<i>General Grant didn't exactly
take me under his wing,</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:39.909
<i>more like under his thumb.</i>

09:39.980 --> 09:42.312
<i>But it was the closest I came
to having a mentor,</i>

09:42.383 --> 09:45.409
<i>and even though he was far from
perfect, I felt a loyalty to him</i>

09:45.486 --> 09:47.215
<i>I couldn't really explain.</i>

09:49.623 --> 09:50.885
Haircut.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.983
Just doesn't make any sense.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.823
It seems like
a perfectly reasonable thing

09:54.895 --> 09:56.328
for a man to do on a Saturday.

09:56.397 --> 09:58.627
<i>No, no, no,
I mean about the money.</i>

09:59.700 --> 10:01.292
You want
your crossword puzzle back?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.995
<i>Normally at this stage
of a stakeout,</i>

10:03.070 --> 10:05.368
<i>I break out the
battery-operated video games,</i>

10:05.439 --> 10:07.805
<i>but since you're here,
20 questions.</i>

10:07.875 --> 10:09.502
<i>Oh, no, 20 questions?</i>

10:09.576 --> 10:12.636
<i>No, 20 questions! I think
of a person, living or dead,</i>

10:12.713 --> 10:14.647
and you try and guess who
they are in 20 questions.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.512
Thomas...
Yes or no only.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.709
<i>Okay, go ahead.
I've got someone.</i>

10:17.785 --> 10:19.650
<i>I'm not exactly in the
mood to play games, Thomas.</i>

10:19.720 --> 10:22.314
Games? This isn't a game.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.914
It is an exercise
in deductive thinking.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.823
Keeps the old
reasoning process sharp.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.692
Very important in my line
of work. First question.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.758
Is this person alive?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.303
No. That's one down
and 19 to go.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.863
Seventeen down and three to go.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.704
Eisenhower!
No.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.175
That's 18 down and two to go.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.872
But you said he was responsible
for ending World War II.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.312
<i>In a way, he was.</i>

10:49.016 --> 10:50.005
Uh-oh.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.555
<i>Oh, no.</i>

10:58.625 --> 11:00.320
Looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

11:00.394 --> 11:03.124
Hannibal loves to spend hours
in the bookstore.

11:03.197 --> 11:05.256
That's 18 down and two to go.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.890
<i>Okay. Well, let's see.</i>

11:06.967 --> 11:10.835
<i>If it isn't Eisenhower
and it isn't Patton, then...</i>

11:10.904 --> 11:12.394
I don't know. I give up.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.973
General Grant.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.169
<i>Oh, come on.
You're a couple wars behind.</i>

11:17.244 --> 11:20.702
<i>Not Ulysses. Warren McKenzie
Grant, my high school coach.</i>

11:20.781 --> 11:22.339
Your high school coach?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.509
<i>In his own way,
he influenced the war.</i>

11:24.585 --> 11:27.053
I am supposed to guess
your high school coach?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.747
<i>Well, if you're not ready
for the advanced level...</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:30.813
<i>That's not advanced,
that's cheating.</i>

11:30.891 --> 11:32.825
<i>No, it's not cheating,
it's misdirection.</i>

11:32.893 --> 11:36.886
And I got you to quit obsessing on
Judge Kearns for a couple of minutes.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.296
<i>All right, I've got one.
You ask.</i>

11:40.000 --> 11:40.989
I'm hungry. How about you?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.764
<i>No, no, no, come on. Living
or dead, male or female.</i>

11:43.837 --> 11:45.134
<i>Come on, give it your best shot.</i>

11:45.205 --> 11:47.867
I'm no good at this
on an empty stomach.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.568
<i>Now, why don't you grab us
a couple of burgers?</i>

11:49.643 --> 11:51.201
I hate burgers.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.146
<i>All right, grab one for me and you
can have anything you want. I'm buying.</i>

11:55.215 --> 11:56.375
No.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.248
What? You said we were gonna
be here for a while.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.844
<i>Now, I need two double cheeseburgers, plain.</i>

12:01.922 --> 12:03.583
<i>All right.
Now, that's just plain.</i>

12:03.657 --> 12:05.557
<i>Nothing on the bun,
no lettuce, nothing.</i>

12:05.626 --> 12:06.752
I'll be right back.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.419
But don't think
you're getting out of this.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.191
Start racking your brain.
You're gonna need it.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.255
<i>"The blonde
was pretty, but too pale,"</i>

12:36.323 --> 12:38.052
<i>"and her thin,
high-arched eyebrows"</i>

12:38.125 --> 12:40.218
<i>"gave her face
a startled look."</i>

13:03.617 --> 13:04.709
Oh!

13:25.072 --> 13:28.166
Do you believe that?
He never eats fast food.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.506
It's a rule with him. Who could have
guessed he would go in that store?

13:31.578 --> 13:34.809
You suppose he suspects?
Where are we going?

13:34.881 --> 13:37.873
Just far enough away
so he thinks we're gone.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.218
What's he doing
at the Flower Mart?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.981
Probably taking a break
from his all-day crime spree.

14:19.393 --> 14:21.088
<i>Thomas, look.</i>

14:21.495 --> 14:24.987
That's Donald Hayes. That's the
defendant from yesterday's trial.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.189
What's going on?

14:34.908 --> 14:35.932
Hey.

14:36.009 --> 14:36.998
Hey!

14:38.845 --> 14:40.506
Get away from him!

14:44.451 --> 14:45.975
You all right?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.830
No trouble. Please don't bring trouble here.

15:14.630 --> 15:17.121
I'm just glad
we were there to help.

15:17.466 --> 15:20.299
<i>As soon as you feel stronger,
we're gonna take you to the police.</i>

15:20.369 --> 15:22.599
You can file an assault charge.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.065
I'm not going to the police.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.440
Then I'll call them
and have them come here.

15:28.511 --> 15:32.140
You have witnesses. We're not
gonna let him get away with this.

15:32.214 --> 15:35.274
<i>Look, this is none
of your business.</i>

15:35.718 --> 15:38.710
What were you fighting
with Donald Hayes about?

15:39.922 --> 15:42.390
What the hell were you doing
following me all over town?

15:42.458 --> 15:44.949
I asked him to.
I was worried about you.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.961
<i>Well, you didn't have to be.</i>

15:48.631 --> 15:49.620
<i>Look,</i>

15:50.933 --> 15:55.836
<i>Oliver Wendell Baldwin, did I
stick my nose into your business</i>

15:55.905 --> 15:59.363
every time I worried about you
during law school?

15:59.442 --> 16:02.070
Why won't you answer
Thomas' question?

16:04.413 --> 16:08.349
<i>Look, I appreciate you patching
me up, but if you don't mind...</i>

16:08.417 --> 16:11.215
<i>Hannibal, if you're in some
kind of trouble, I want to help.</i>

16:11.287 --> 16:13.881
<i>If it means going to the
Review Board, I'll go with you.</i>

16:13.956 --> 16:17.289
<i>Why? Do you have some kind of hard
evidence against me, counselor?</i>

16:17.360 --> 16:19.590
Something that will stand up
in court?

16:20.096 --> 16:21.529
<i>Or you, sir?</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:24.325
No. Just a hunch.

16:25.134 --> 16:26.658
And observation.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.567
And a great deal of concern.

16:28.671 --> 16:31.367
Which smells a lot
like harassment to me.

16:34.143 --> 16:39.342
There's also this $100 bill that
dropped out of the flower box

16:39.415 --> 16:41.406
that Hayes was trying
to give you.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.784
<i>Hannibal, I know
this is very hard on you,</i>

16:54.030 --> 16:55.190
but I...

16:55.264 --> 16:59.758
<i>I mean, don't you think that
if I've seen the changes...</i>

17:04.640 --> 17:07.233
I think what she's trying
to say is...

17:07.309 --> 17:10.506
<i>Well, look, if Carol
has seen certain shifts</i>

17:10.579 --> 17:13.707
<i>in your lifestyle
and your professional conduct,</i>

17:13.782 --> 17:15.773
<i>I mean, don't you think
it's just a matter of time</i>

17:15.851 --> 17:18.411
<i>before other people
start seeing it, too?</i>

17:19.888 --> 17:23.655
Why did you meet Donald Hayes?
What were you fighting about?

17:28.764 --> 17:30.959
It was a chance encounter.

17:31.233 --> 17:34.634
He wanted to contribute some
money to Hawaii Legal Aid.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.637
I told him to go through
channels. He...

17:38.040 --> 17:39.803
He got angry.

17:40.142 --> 17:44.977
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's been a very long day.</i>

18:03.532 --> 18:04.999
<i>Why is he doing this?</i>

18:05.434 --> 18:06.628
<i>He's not doing it to you, Carol.</i>

18:06.702 --> 18:07.999
He's doing it to himself.
I know.

18:08.070 --> 18:12.029
But what am I supposed to do?
Stop him for his own good?

18:12.108 --> 18:15.407
Or look the other way
and become a partner to it?

18:16.378 --> 18:17.606
I don't know.

18:32.628 --> 18:36.928
Integrity. It's a nine-letter
word for completeness.

18:38.167 --> 18:39.657
Integrity.

18:55.584 --> 18:59.645
<i>8:00, and don't be late. Okay,
I'll see you here. Thanks. Bye.</i>

19:00.856 --> 19:02.221
I got people
coming to this party

19:02.291 --> 19:04.020
that Ice Pick hasn't seen
in 20 years.

19:04.093 --> 19:05.856
I hope he still recognizes them.

19:05.928 --> 19:07.862
Are you kidding?
He's gonna faint.

19:07.930 --> 19:09.488
He may not be the only one.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.396
Have you asked Higgins
about this party yet?

19:11.467 --> 19:14.129
<i>Oh. Hey, Thomas, I need
your help with something.</i>

19:14.637 --> 19:17.037
<i>Do you remember me telling you
about Ice Pick's girlfriend, Grace?</i>

19:17.106 --> 19:19.370
The only woman
he ever really loved.

19:19.441 --> 19:21.705
<i>That's right. And I've been
talking myself blue in the face,</i>

19:21.777 --> 19:24.109
but I cannot convince her
to come to the party.

19:24.180 --> 19:27.149
Then that's one less phone
call you'll have to make...

19:27.216 --> 19:28.240
Higgins...

19:28.317 --> 19:30.581
when you call everyone
to cancel the party.

19:30.653 --> 19:34.180
<i>Oh, come on, Higgie. You can't
make him cancel this party.</i>

19:34.256 --> 19:36.952
<i>He's got people coming
from Chicago, Miami.</i>

19:37.026 --> 19:39.187
Everything's all planned
for tomorrow night...

19:39.261 --> 19:41.491
Then it will simply
have to be un-planned.

19:41.564 --> 19:43.555
The board of directors
will not approve a party

19:43.632 --> 19:46.567
honoring someone of Ice
Pick's dubious reputation.

19:46.635 --> 19:49.832
They can't tell me who I can and
who I can't throw a party for.

19:49.905 --> 19:52.738
They wouldn't dream of it. They're
simply telling you it can't be here.

19:52.808 --> 19:56.744
<i>They might reconsider
if you asked them, Higgins.</i>

19:56.812 --> 19:59.042
As a kind of personal favor?

20:00.850 --> 20:02.374
<i>Higgins,</i>

20:03.886 --> 20:05.786
did I ever tell you
about the time

20:05.855 --> 20:08.551
that Ice Pick brought flowers
to my parents' funeral?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.092
<i>It was January 23, 1958.</i>

20:11.160 --> 20:13.492
<i>I was 12 years old, and
my sister, Wendy, was five.</i>

20:13.562 --> 20:15.393
My parents had just been
killed in an automobile...

20:15.464 --> 20:17.193
<i>Warren McKenzie Grant.</i>

20:17.266 --> 20:20.360
<i>I bet it had been five years
since I'd even thought about him.</i>

20:20.436 --> 20:23.872
<i>But for some reason, his
presence had been with me all day.</i>

20:28.844 --> 20:31.870
<i>It wasn't just a matter of
remembering things about him.</i>

20:31.947 --> 20:37.044
<i>It was more a matter of seeing things
in myself that he'd drummed into me,</i>

20:37.419 --> 20:41.549
<i>and recognizing that at least a
small part of Thomas Sullivan Magnum</i>

20:41.624 --> 20:45.219
<i>was pure Warren McKenzie
Grant, for better or worse,</i>

20:45.294 --> 20:50.163
<i>and realizing that even though disillusionment
had replaced hero worship over the years,</i>

20:50.232 --> 20:52.393
<i>I missed him.</i>

20:52.468 --> 20:54.333
<i>I really didn't know
what I'd do if I were faced</i>

20:54.403 --> 20:56.462
<i>with the decision Carol
had to make about a man</i>

20:56.538 --> 20:59.098
<i>who had influenced her life
so much.</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:18.451
Hello?

21:18.527 --> 21:21.985
<i>Thomas, I'm at
Judge Kearns' house.</i>

21:22.064 --> 21:23.224
<i>Carol, what's wrong?</i>

21:39.381 --> 21:40.370
Carol.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.346
<i>Oh, Thomas.</i>

22:12.359 --> 22:15.522
I can tell you right now what
the report's going to say.

22:15.582 --> 22:17.880
Judge Kearns committed suicide.

22:17.951 --> 22:20.181
I won't believe it was suicide.

22:20.253 --> 22:22.084
<i>I'm sorry, Carol.
Everything points to it.</i>

22:22.155 --> 22:23.213
Nothing points to it.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.884
This was not the kind of man
who would take his own life.

22:25.959 --> 22:26.983
Look around you.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.551
<i>The photo album,
the empty bottle of whiskey,</i>

22:29.629 --> 22:32.962
the nickel-plated. 38 with
only his fingerprints on it.

22:33.033 --> 22:34.398
No forced entry.

22:34.468 --> 22:35.799
No suicide note.

22:35.869 --> 22:38.429
<i>Even so, this is a classic case of suicide.</i>

22:38.505 --> 22:41.770
Maybe. Or maybe somebody
wants us to think it is.

22:41.842 --> 22:45.209
You told me yourself you thought
that he was taking payoffs.

22:45.278 --> 22:47.007
Looks to me like
he spent the night

22:47.080 --> 22:49.241
going through his scrapbook
of achievements

22:49.316 --> 22:51.841
and realized he couldn't
live with the scandal

22:51.918 --> 22:54.751
of being caught with his
hand in the cookie jar.

22:54.821 --> 22:58.257
Why did he leave a message on my
answering machine to come and see him

22:58.325 --> 23:00.520
if he was planning
to pull the trigger?

23:00.594 --> 23:02.459
Why did he write
a letter of resignation

23:02.529 --> 23:04.224
if he wasn't going to be around?

23:04.297 --> 23:07.755
<i>Even if he resigned, he'd still
have to face criminal charges.</i>

23:07.834 --> 23:10.803
I think he wanted to confess
and get it all out in the open.

23:10.871 --> 23:12.702
<i>I know how difficult
this is for you,</i>

23:12.773 --> 23:16.470
but I have to have more to go on
than your gut feeling about this.

23:16.543 --> 23:17.635
All right.

23:19.379 --> 23:22.314
<i>How about the fact
that over the past six months,</i>

23:22.382 --> 23:25.943
<i>Hannibal has let three
defendants off on technicalities,</i>

23:26.019 --> 23:28.078
and all three of them
worked at Hoku Florists?

23:28.155 --> 23:31.522
How about the fact that this was
the second time Donald Hayes came up

23:31.591 --> 23:33.024
<i>before Judge Kearns
in the last year,</i>

23:33.093 --> 23:36.290
and it was the second time
that he was let off?

23:36.363 --> 23:39.264
I've been at my office most of
the night going through the files.

23:39.332 --> 23:41.323
That's why I missed his call.

23:41.401 --> 23:44.962
<i>Lieutenant, I know this points
more to bribery than murder,</i>

23:45.038 --> 23:47.973
<i>but if he was trying to expose
whatever racket they were in,</i>

23:48.041 --> 23:49.508
<i>well, that's a motive
for murder.</i>

23:49.576 --> 23:51.669
You gotta have
more than a motive.

23:52.179 --> 23:55.615
<i>Well, we saw Donald Hayes try to give
Judge Kearns what we think was some money.</i>

23:55.682 --> 23:58.446
A couple $100 bills fell to the
ground. I still have one of them.

23:58.518 --> 24:01.851
I gave the other one to Judge
Kearns. Did you find one on the body?

24:01.922 --> 24:02.946
No.

24:03.023 --> 24:04.251
<i>Well, then,
as far as I can tell,</i>

24:04.324 --> 24:05.518
nobody's seen it
since his death.

24:05.592 --> 24:08.322
<i>Now, that may not mean
anything, but then again...</i>

24:08.395 --> 24:11.558
<i>All right, I'll go by and
talk to Hayes. Now, ask around.</i>

24:11.631 --> 24:14.327
<i>If anything new comes up,
give me a call.</i>

24:15.068 --> 24:17.764
You still don't have a case.

24:17.838 --> 24:19.499
I know.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.379
Excuse me.

24:48.201 --> 24:51.034
I always loved this back yard.
It seemed so peaceful.

24:51.938 --> 24:52.927
Carol...

24:54.074 --> 24:57.373
<i>I called his sister in Tulsa
and his son on the Big Island,</i>

24:57.444 --> 24:59.207
and they're both
flying in tonight.

24:59.279 --> 25:02.771
They want the funeral tomorrow.
It just seems so awfully fast.

25:02.916 --> 25:06.545
But I told them that I'd make
some preliminary phone calls.

25:11.124 --> 25:12.113
<i>Carol,</i>

25:13.260 --> 25:15.626
you want to stay at the estate
for a couple of days?

25:15.695 --> 25:17.959
No. I have so much to do.

25:18.098 --> 25:20.498
I want to check out the stuff
at the Hoku Florists.

25:20.567 --> 25:22.194
<i>Now, I know
that the police department...</i>

25:22.269 --> 25:24.237
<i>It's going to be second
priority to them, and I just...</i>

25:24.304 --> 25:25.828
I understand why. I can't...

25:25.906 --> 25:26.998
<i>Carol, it is much too dangerous</i>

25:27.073 --> 25:29.371
for you to go down there
and start asking questions.

25:29.442 --> 25:31.842
<i>I owe it to him, Thomas.
I started this.</i>

25:31.912 --> 25:34.403
<i>No, you didn't. You just
got caught up in the middle.</i>

25:35.081 --> 25:38.016
<i>Thomas, you know Hannibal,
the other Hannibal,</i>

25:38.985 --> 25:42.921
he committed suicide rather
than surrender to the Roman army.

25:46.193 --> 25:49.822
I'm not sure
that we'll ever know

25:50.764 --> 25:53.824
<i>if that's what Judge Kearns
did, but I promise you,</i>

25:55.001 --> 25:57.595
I'll do everything I can
to find out for you.

26:16.423 --> 26:18.516
A good hobby
is absolutely essential

26:18.592 --> 26:20.822
<i>to the well-being
of the psyche,</i>

26:21.528 --> 26:24.725
<i>lifting one's thoughts above
mundane, day-to-day problems</i>

26:24.798 --> 26:28.359
into a more elevated plane.

26:29.436 --> 26:30.926
Wouldn't you say?

26:31.371 --> 26:33.601
<i>Yeah, I guess so.
Higgins?</i>

26:33.907 --> 26:36.102
You need to ask me a favor.

26:36.743 --> 26:38.176
Yes. It's about...

26:38.245 --> 26:39.473
Rick's party.

26:41.214 --> 26:43.239
In a way. How did you...

26:43.316 --> 26:45.750
It's one of the side effects
of working on a hobby.

26:45.819 --> 26:50.222
<i>Once your entire energy is focused
on an object, such as this orchid,</i>

26:50.290 --> 26:52.986
<i>the mind is no longer
cluttered with self-concerns,</i>

26:53.059 --> 26:57.155
and therefore more able to
accurately interpret incoming signals.

26:57.464 --> 26:59.955
Kind of a self-hypnosis.

27:00.267 --> 27:01.666
Oh. Well...

27:01.735 --> 27:04.101
<i>For example,
the moment you walked in,</i>

27:04.170 --> 27:07.230
I instinctively knew exactly
why you were coming to me.

27:08.375 --> 27:09.535
You did?

27:09.609 --> 27:10.803
But you're too late.

27:11.077 --> 27:12.704
<i>I've already talked
to the board of directors,</i>

27:12.779 --> 27:14.303
<i>and they've agreed,
with some misgivings,</i>

27:14.381 --> 27:16.212
to allow Rick to hold the party

27:16.283 --> 27:17.750
this one time.

27:17.817 --> 27:18.806
I know.

27:20.453 --> 27:21.715
You know?

27:21.921 --> 27:26.085
<i>But since you're all self-hypnotized
here, you knew that I knew.</i>

27:28.328 --> 27:30.023
<i>Well, that is, I...</i>

27:30.096 --> 27:32.587
And since you must know

27:32.666 --> 27:34.964
<i>what I really came
to ask you for,</i>

27:35.035 --> 27:38.368
I'll just skip the question
and wait for the answer.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.844
<i>You're right, Higgins. This
staring-at-orchids stuff really works.</i>

27:46.913 --> 27:49.313
I already know
what the answer is.

27:51.384 --> 27:52.851
<i>Did I hear you correctly?</i>

27:54.087 --> 27:56.385
Twenty-five
floral arrangements?

27:56.456 --> 28:00.893
<i>Yes. And as I'll be doing all
of the arrangements myself,</i>

28:00.960 --> 28:04.396
I'll need to inspect
each flower personally.

28:04.597 --> 28:07.998
I'm afraid our selection is
a little low at the moment.

28:08.068 --> 28:09.933
If you would like to come
back tomorrow morning...

28:10.003 --> 28:13.996
<i>No. That is, all of the
arrangements are needed for an event</i>

28:14.074 --> 28:16.008
scheduled for this evening.

28:16.076 --> 28:18.408
I'll have to make do
with what you have.

28:18.478 --> 28:22.312
Perhaps we could start
with heliconias.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.290
"The south wind
searches for the flowers"

29:07.360 --> 29:09.658
"whose fragrance
late he bore..."

29:10.029 --> 29:13.931
"And sighs to find them in the
wood and by the stream no more."

29:14.000 --> 29:16.195
<i>William Bryant.
The Death of the Flowers.</i>

29:16.269 --> 29:17.429
Precisely.

29:17.504 --> 29:20.337
We have a large supply
of chrysanthemums.

29:34.854 --> 29:38.415
"Full many a flower
is born to blush unseen..."

29:39.058 --> 29:41.686
"And waste its sweetness
on the desert air."

29:41.761 --> 29:43.661
<i>Elegy written
in a Country Churchyard.</i>

29:43.730 --> 29:46.563
<i>One of the first poems
I ever committed to memory,</i>

29:46.866 --> 29:49.926
but perhaps never fully
appreciated until this moment.

29:50.003 --> 29:53.734
You have more than enough here
for 25 arrangements.

29:53.807 --> 29:56.537
<i>Well, one can never be
too prepared.</i>

29:56.609 --> 29:59.169
Perhaps we should go
through the red ginger again.

29:59.245 --> 30:02.646
I'll leave you to go through
them while I start the paperwork.

30:04.918 --> 30:06.351
Where are you going?

30:06.419 --> 30:08.853
<i>To the office,
to get the invoices.</i>

30:10.523 --> 30:15.893
I wonder if I might ask you a
question first about these vases here?

30:37.183 --> 30:39.947
<i>I believe I prefer
the design of this one,</i>

30:40.920 --> 30:45.050
yet the color of the other one is so
much more compatible with the red ginger.

31:01.074 --> 31:04.066
<i>On the other hand, I believe
the bird of paradise arrangement</i>

31:04.143 --> 31:06.703
would do quite nicely in this.

31:09.582 --> 31:12.847
<i>Oh, Donald, get me a book
of invoices from the office.</i>

31:12.919 --> 31:14.216
Sure.

31:17.190 --> 31:19.852
<i>Well, perhaps you would like
to take all three?</i>

31:19.926 --> 31:20.915
Hmm?

31:39.913 --> 31:43.644
<i>Actually, I don't think I'll
take any vases at the moment.</i>

31:43.716 --> 31:45.411
I'll just...

31:50.323 --> 31:51.756
Is something wrong?

31:55.128 --> 31:57.358
<i>Oh, no. No, no.
Everything's fine.</i>

31:57.463 --> 31:59.658
<i>If you'll write up the order,</i>

31:59.732 --> 32:01.563
I'd like to charge it
to the King Kamehameha Club.

32:01.634 --> 32:05.400
I'm chairman of the board of
directors. Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

32:05.838 --> 32:07.135
Grace Chang.

32:08.207 --> 32:09.504
Pleased to meet you.

32:11.010 --> 32:13.308
Grace Chang is into everything.

32:13.947 --> 32:16.643
<i>Extortion,
prostitution kickbacks...</i>

32:17.183 --> 32:19.276
<i>Boy, I wonder if Rick
has any idea</i>

32:19.352 --> 32:22.253
that Ice Pick's one true love
is fronting these racketeers.

32:22.322 --> 32:26.918
Surely there must be some other
explanation. She hardly seems the type.

32:26.993 --> 32:29.018
Look at this.
A chain of title

32:29.095 --> 32:32.258
showing common ownership
of The Sea and Sand on Kuhio.

32:32.332 --> 32:34.163
The Sea and Sand?
Isn't that...

32:34.233 --> 32:36.030
Hooker central.

32:37.670 --> 32:40.833
Here's a record of the
payments they made to Hannibal.

32:45.678 --> 32:49.580
<i>Well, this ledger is a record
of payments to William Paoa.</i>

32:51.417 --> 32:53.783
Might as well add murder
to their list of activities.

32:53.853 --> 32:57.380
Paoa has a reputation of being
the best hit man on the Island.

32:58.524 --> 33:01.152
The last entry was today.

33:03.296 --> 33:05.787
<i>Well, that lends credibility</i>

33:05.865 --> 33:08.663
to the theory that Judge Kearns was murdered.

33:10.036 --> 33:12.527
They're not gonna
get away with this.

33:12.605 --> 33:16.473
We have enough information here to put
Donald Hayes away for a very long time.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.442
I don't think so.
None of the titles come back

33:18.511 --> 33:21.036
to Grace Chang
or to Donald Hayes.

33:24.317 --> 33:26.547
Francis Hofstetler?

33:29.689 --> 33:31.247
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

33:31.557 --> 33:32.546
Ice Pick.

33:37.595 --> 33:38.653
It's not possible.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.630
<i>Rick... I'm telling you, it's not possible.</i>

33:40.698 --> 33:41.995
It's right here
in black and white.

33:42.067 --> 33:44.934
Grace Chang and Donald Hayes are
a front for Ice Pick's activities.

33:45.003 --> 33:46.300
He's retired.
You know that.

33:46.371 --> 33:47.463
That's what he says.

33:47.539 --> 33:48.506
<i>He did time, he paid his debt,</i>

33:48.573 --> 33:49.733
and he's been clean ever since.

33:49.808 --> 33:51.799
<i>Look at these documents. Oh,
you look at the documents.</i>

33:51.876 --> 33:54.470
<i>I don't have to. He's my friend,
and I know this is a mistake.</i>

33:54.546 --> 33:56.343
<i>It's a mistake
that could link him to murder,</i>

33:56.414 --> 33:58.314
and maybe Hayes and Grace
as accessories.

33:58.383 --> 33:59.372
<i>Let me tell you something,
Thomas.</i>

33:59.451 --> 34:01.214
Ice Pick would never drag
Grace into something like this.

34:01.286 --> 34:02.844
He loved this woman.
He wanted to marry her.

34:02.921 --> 34:04.889
So you told me. But that doesn't
have anything to do with...

34:04.956 --> 34:06.423
I'm not finished yet.

34:06.491 --> 34:08.583
He thought his life was over
when she married another man.

34:08.659 --> 34:11.652
<i>And when her son was killed in a gang
war, well, he took care of everything.</i>

34:11.728 --> 34:12.956
Rick...
And I mean everything!

34:13.031 --> 34:16.023
He got her out of Chicago and set her
up in a business right here in Honolulu.

34:16.101 --> 34:18.069
<i>You could bet
your bottom dollar, Thomas,</i>

34:18.136 --> 34:20.969
he wouldn't do anything
to hurt her.

34:22.172 --> 34:23.800
I've been looking at this
from the wrong angle.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.672
<i>Yeah, that's what I've been
trying to tell you. Come on!</i>

34:25.743 --> 34:27.108
What?
We're going to see Ice Pick.

34:27.178 --> 34:29.737
I'm not gonna insult Ice Pick by
talking to him about this stuff.

34:29.813 --> 34:33.875
You are unless you want him to end up
in jail for a murder he didn't commit.

34:34.552 --> 34:36.213
<i>Damn you, Thomas!</i>

34:37.155 --> 34:39.054
<i>The one thing I'd failed to see,</i>

34:39.123 --> 34:41.717
<i>what it was that the memory
of General Grant</i>

34:41.793 --> 34:43.385
<i>had been trying
to remind me of...</i>

34:43.460 --> 34:45.895
<i>A beautiful fall day,
a football game,</i>

34:45.964 --> 34:48.056
<i>a play that maybe the coach
shouldn't have called.</i>

34:48.132 --> 34:50.362
<i>His star player was badly hurt.</i>

34:50.668 --> 34:54.900
<i>And Warren McKenzie Grant never forgave
himself for the young man's injuries.</i>

34:54.973 --> 34:57.567
<i>And when the young man,
confined to a wheelchair,</i>

34:57.642 --> 35:00.110
<i>began taking advantage
of that guilt,</i>

35:00.178 --> 35:03.636
<i>almost everyone understood why
General Grant let him do it.</i>

35:03.715 --> 35:05.182
<i>Almost everyone
looked the other way</i>

35:05.250 --> 35:08.708
<i>when the General allowed the young
man to cheat on exams and passed him.</i>

35:08.786 --> 35:13.120
<i>Almost everyone,
except Thomas Sullivan Magnum,</i>

35:13.892 --> 35:17.589
<i>who probably only understood
for the first time today.</i>

35:19.063 --> 35:20.860
It's very good.

35:20.932 --> 35:23.730
<i>Of course, it'll never
stand up in a court of law,</i>

35:24.469 --> 35:26.869
but it's definitely
professional.

35:28.306 --> 35:30.604
What else did I sign my name to?

35:30.975 --> 35:32.966
They've left
a pretty substantial trail

35:33.044 --> 35:36.480
for someone to tie you into
prostitution kickbacks...

35:36.548 --> 35:40.075
<i>Marvin, it's okay.
You can leave us alone.</i>

35:45.823 --> 35:48.986
<i>Now, what do you fellas
got in mind?</i>

35:50.195 --> 35:53.926
I want to bring in the person who killed
Judge Kearns. It's very important to me.

35:53.998 --> 35:56.694
Thomas says they can
tie you into this thing.

35:56.768 --> 35:59.635
I suppose if I didn't
contest these signatures...

35:59.704 --> 36:01.831
But you are gonna contest?

36:04.309 --> 36:05.606
So you take these to the police.

36:05.677 --> 36:08.271
Is that gonna
bring Judge Kearns back?

36:10.715 --> 36:13.240
Don't you think your debt
to Grace Chang is paid?

36:14.219 --> 36:17.154
I had to tell him.
I had to explain that he...

36:24.162 --> 36:29.566
Grace Chang's boy. He could've been
my son if things had been different.

36:30.368 --> 36:34.168
I promised her that I'd see that
nothing ever happened to him.

36:37.108 --> 36:39.474
That was a promise
I couldn't keep.

36:42.013 --> 36:44.641
No one could keep
that kind of promise.

36:46.117 --> 36:48.347
<i>Grace forgave me, but I didn't.</i>

36:50.255 --> 36:52.917
<i>Not then, not ever.</i>

37:00.131 --> 37:03.658
Letting Grace Chang use you isn't
going to get rid of that guilt.

37:09.574 --> 37:14.944
<i>Well, the world isn't gonna
end in the next 12 hours?</i>

37:15.413 --> 37:16.573
No.

37:16.981 --> 37:18.710
You'll hear from me.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.291
<i>Look, Ricky,</i>

37:33.298 --> 37:36.062
<i>I don't have a lot of time
to think this through,</i>

37:36.501 --> 37:40.995
<i>so I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
come to your surprise birthday party.</i>

37:44.208 --> 37:46.608
How do you always
find these things out?

37:47.078 --> 37:50.673
I want to tell you something.
I deeply appreciate it.

37:52.317 --> 37:53.944
<i>Thanks, Ice Pick.</i>

38:17.108 --> 38:20.839
<i>"Mentor: A wise
and trusted teacher or guide."</i>

38:23.348 --> 38:26.408
<i>As usual, Webster's spoke
volumes with just a few words.</i>

38:26.484 --> 38:30.580
<i>Beyond the deceptively simple
definition was an implied relationship,</i>

38:30.655 --> 38:32.213
<i>student and master.</i>

38:32.290 --> 38:35.987
<i>What the definition failed to
describe was the ironic twist.</i>

38:36.160 --> 38:38.594
<i>If the relationship
were to grow and mature,</i>

38:38.663 --> 38:42.121
<i>the wise and trusted guide would
inevitably turn into student,</i>

38:42.200 --> 38:44.031
<i>and the student to teacher.</i>

38:44.102 --> 38:46.229
<i>Sometimes the change
could be painful.</i>

38:46.304 --> 38:50.240
<i>Sometimes the student couldn't bear
to see the chink in the mentor's armor.</i>

38:50.308 --> 38:53.903
<i>Sometimes the mentor didn't
even realize that's what he was.</i>

38:53.978 --> 38:55.570
<i>But one thing was certain.</i>

38:55.646 --> 38:58.809
<i>Once the change in the
relationship started to occur,</i>

38:58.883 --> 39:02.284
<i>there was no way to stop it
or to go back.</i>

42:05.536 --> 42:06.628
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

42:07.371 --> 42:09.965
<i>I don't want her
picked up by strangers,</i>

42:11.008 --> 42:13.806
<i>but I'll see to it
that Donald Hayes is there.</i>

42:19.750 --> 42:22.913
I want to talk to her myself.

43:58.416 --> 44:00.884
<i>"From too much love of living,</i>

44:01.686 --> 44:04.553
<i>"from hope and fear set free,"</i>

44:05.523 --> 44:10.460
"we thank with brief thanksgiving
whatever gods there be"

44:11.062 --> 44:12.927
"that even the weariest river"

44:13.698 --> 44:17.828
"winds somewhere safe to sea."

46:38.709 --> 46:41.075
<i>Somehow,
I knew that through all this,</i>

46:41.145 --> 46:43.238
<i>I had wrapped up
some unfinished business</i>

46:43.314 --> 46:46.772
<i>with one of the most
important people in my life.</i>

46:49.620 --> 46:53.681
<i>And I knew that one day, if
not this day, Carol would, too.</i>
