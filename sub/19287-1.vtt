00:25.291 --> 00:26.658
Cassie?

00:29.462 --> 00:31.063
Cassie?

00:33.299 --> 00:34.700
Cassie?

00:36.169 --> 00:38.103
- Cassie.
- Hmm?

00:39.472 --> 00:42.107
Did you sleep in my
bed again last night?

00:42.109 --> 00:43.609
No, I just came in here
this morning

00:43.611 --> 00:46.145
to cuddle with you.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.480
Like, I get that you're
obsessed with me,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.749
but you have, like,
a really nice big bed,

00:50.751 --> 00:53.118
and that's only, like,
ten feet away.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.788
It's really
not that hard to walk to.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.590
Well, your bed
is so much more comfy.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.828
I don't know. It's weird
sleeping without Matthew.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.530
I'm just not used to it yet.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.232
So you're using me.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.801
Duh.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.745
So who's gonna make
breakfast today?

01:19.747 --> 01:24.283
Mm, I made it last weekend,
so probably you.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.785
Uh, no, i made it last weekend.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.787
No, that was two
weekends ago, remember?

01:28.789 --> 01:30.789
No, that was last Saturday.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.158
- Blueberry pancakes.
- Fine.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.160
Rock, paper, scissors over it?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.395
Fine.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.799
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.407
- Really?
- No? Okay.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.576
- Oh. No.
- Okay.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.344
Okay, fine. Whatever.
I'll make it.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.679
Yes!

01:53.681 --> 01:55.681
Under one con-di-tion.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.816
- No!
- Yes.

01:57.818 --> 02:01.120
You have to promise
never to leave me. Okay?

02:01.122 --> 02:03.122
Matthew is gone,
and you are all that I have now

02:03.124 --> 02:05.457
in my sad and lonely life.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.426
That is a lot to ask for
in return for pancakes.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.729
They're blueberry pancakes.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.231
Fine.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.666
But just for the pancakes.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.971
Bacon melt cheeseburger,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.706
Philly cheese steak.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.541
A pulled pork sandwich.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.543
You'd think they'd
have more vegetarian options.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.445
Right? I mean, god forbid a
vegan tries to eat here.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.314
You know,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.783
the people that don't eat
any animal byproducts.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.319
Oh, we know what vegans are, honey.
We have the Google at home.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.920
Oh, babe, don't call
it "the Google."

03:41.922 --> 03:43.722
You're making us look uncool.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.591
No, I think
it's kind of hipster of me

03:45.593 --> 03:47.326
- to call it "the Google."
- You know, even if it's wrong,

03:47.328 --> 03:48.660
if mom wants to call it
"the Google,"

03:48.662 --> 03:49.995
then we should support her.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.630
- Thank you.
- Well.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.368
Do you know what group
of people tend to have

03:56.370 --> 03:59.004
a lot of vegans, actually, is...

03:59.006 --> 04:01.773
- Lesbians.
- Oh, really?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.510
W-we're gonna need
a couple more minutes.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.012
Thank you.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.021
It's a shame Matthew couldn't
make it out this evening.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.390
Uh, well, he was busy so...

04:18.392 --> 04:20.358
Working nights to pay
his way through med school

04:20.361 --> 04:21.860
during the day.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.296
That's one ambitious
man you have.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.797
You must be so proud.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.500
- You're dating a doctor.
- Hmm.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.369
He's gonna cure cancer one day.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.372
Well, he's at
the chiropractic college.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.541
So he's gonna be a chiropractor.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.543
But if you guys think that's one
step closer to curing cancer,

04:38.545 --> 04:40.045
then, sure, yeah.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.047
He's gonna save
millions of lives.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.049
This place is really dope.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.051
Oh, good use
of the word "dope," honey.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.519
- Mm.
- A lot of the kids

04:47.521 --> 04:48.920
from campus hang out here.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.722
Like, the other day,
we couldn't even get in

04:50.724 --> 04:53.325
'cause the whole softball team
was having a party here.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.328
Did you know that most of the
girls on the softball team

04:56.330 --> 04:57.663
- are les...
- Let me guess.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.033
- Lesbians?
- Is it lesbians?

05:06.406 --> 05:08.073
I, um,

05:08.075 --> 05:10.942
got that internship
at the creative agency.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.412
- Mm.
- That's wonderful.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.782
- How much does that pay?
- Well, it's an internship.

05:16.784 --> 05:21.019
So, I don't know,
roughly like six figures.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.587
- So nothing.
- Uh,

05:22.589 --> 05:23.922
I think that
a ten dollar per diem

05:23.924 --> 05:25.991
is a lot more than nothing.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.859
How are you gonna survive
on ten dollars a day?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.795
I don't know.
Dumpster diving.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.963
Be serious.
We worry about you.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.966
It's a good thing
that you have Matthew.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.569
Especially if I get cancer.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.010
You know what?
I was gonna wait until

05:45.012 --> 05:46.545
we ordered dessert,
but I think I'm just gonna...

05:46.547 --> 05:47.813
Oh, I hope they have something

05:47.815 --> 05:49.381
with bacon bits on it.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.849
I hear that's like
really trendy right now.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.718
Bacon is my favorite food group.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.453
I wouldn't mind like
a hot fudge sundae, though.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.921
Ugh! I'd share
that with you.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.756
You know, with some drizzle
and some nuts on it.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.625
- Salty, something sweet...
- We'll get two spoons, okay?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.828
Excuse me.
I'm trying to tell you guys

06:02.830 --> 06:04.629
something extremely difficult
and heart wrenching,

06:04.631 --> 06:05.964
and, I mean, it might kill me,

06:05.966 --> 06:08.100
so a little respect, please.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.001
John, put your fork down.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.137
MacKenzie's having a nervous
breakdown or indigestion.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.139
- I can't tell.
- Can't be indigestion.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.841
I mean, she's hardly
touched her food.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.109
John, please focus on
our daughter.

06:17.111 --> 06:20.579
- She's dying.
- Thank you, mom.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.013
Hmm.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.717
Mom...

06:27.120 --> 06:28.720
Dad...

06:36.829 --> 06:39.731
I'm gay.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.467
No, no.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.635
No.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.437
Oh, god, why?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.872
No, MacKenzie.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.407
How could you do that to us?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.075
What did we ever do
to deserve this?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.010
Oh, my god, no.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.147
MacKenzie, no!

06:55.149 --> 06:57.616
So how's the planning going
for your Europe trip?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.585
Um, it's been postponed.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.953
But this is the final summer
you're free.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.823
And soon Matthew
will be working all the time.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.158
You don't him
to take time off work

07:06.160 --> 07:07.692
to go gallivanting
across Europe.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.861
Matthew's probably
just busy, honey,

07:09.863 --> 07:11.730
with school and work.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.031
- He's gonna be a doctor.
- I know that, dear.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.933
I just thought I'd be nice
for him to take a break

07:14.935 --> 07:16.468
from all of his hard work.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.470
You know, I just...

07:18.472 --> 07:21.139
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.675
Matthew and I

07:23.677 --> 07:25.444
broke up.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.883
What does that mean?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.586
It means
we are no longer dating.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.063
- Oh...

07:45.065 --> 07:46.731
Oh, my god.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.134
Shh! Shh! Shh!

08:00.079 --> 08:02.614
Honey, we know.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.916
What do you mean
you know? How?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.919
We read your diary every night
when you went to bed.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.855
We're your parents.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.556
We just know these things.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.259
And I found a copy of
"the l word" under your bed

08:14.261 --> 08:15.961
- like five years ago,
- yeah.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.796
Alice is hilarious.
I mean, Bette is terrifying.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.265
I hate you both.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.068
What?
What did you do?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.536
I didn't do anything.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.804
Well, you must've done something

08:25.806 --> 08:27.205
for him to break up with you.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.741
Uh, actually, i left him.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.010
But thanks for assuming
he dumped me.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.547
Why did you break up with him?

08:35.549 --> 08:38.149
He was perfect for you.
He was perfect for you.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.787
Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh, honey.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.121
He proposed.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.191
What?

08:49.629 --> 08:52.130
Are you...

08:52.132 --> 08:54.065
- A lesbian?
- No.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.601
I'm not a lesbian.
But you know what?

08:56.603 --> 08:58.537
Sometimes I wish I was.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.039
Don't say that.
That's horrible.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.074
So...

09:03.076 --> 09:04.576
Is it Cassie?

09:04.578 --> 09:06.244
Is it Cassie what?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.947
- Is Cassie your lover?
- Eck. Eww.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.882
Please don't ever say
"lover" again.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.752
- Lover.
- Ugh. Ugh.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.321
And, no, Cassie isn't gay.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.923
Are you sure?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.157
Yes.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.893
Besides, i haven't told her yet.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.595
Told her what?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.031
That I'm gay.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.832
Ah, don't worry about it, honey.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.267
- I'm sure she knows.
- Mm-hmm. Honey, you're a...

09:29.269 --> 09:30.936
What do they call it, John?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.171
- A hundred footer.
- You are a hundred footer.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.841
And you guys are just
completely okay with this?

09:36.843 --> 09:38.810
To be honest, i was worried
you were going to tell us

09:38.812 --> 09:40.178
- you were a vegan.
- Yeah.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.980
I mean, I'm relieved
that you're gay.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.848
- I mean, men are assholes.
- Mm-hmm.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.183
If I could be gay, i would be.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.686
That's disgusting.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.044
- Babe.
- And how did it go?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.347
It was horrible.
It was worse than expected.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.248
I don't even
want to talk about it.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.250
Oh, doll, that's really shitty.
I'm so sorry.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.253
Like, they didn't
even care at all.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.222
They showed
no emotion whatsoever.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.390
No, that's a lie.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.925
They were like happy about it.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.259
Isn't that sick?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.128
Yeah, that sounds
really devastating.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.832
I mean, it took me
months to finally...

10:33.834 --> 10:35.800
To summon the courage
to come out to them

10:35.802 --> 10:38.303
and then they just treat it
like it's no big deal.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.306
Well, I'm sorry,
but it is a big deal.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.709
Like, they weren't even
upset at all.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.212
Isn't that fucked?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.214
Oh, my god.
Why are they not upset?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.749
Do they not love me?

10:50.751 --> 10:52.250
They definitely
don't care about you.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.219
I mean, my parents told me
i was an abomination

10:54.221 --> 10:56.921
and that I was gonna
burn in hell for all eternity.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.923
Way to rub it in my face.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.759
Oh, and they didn't even tell me

11:00.761 --> 11:02.427
that they were proud of me.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.863
Isn't that like the number
one thing you're supposed

11:04.865 --> 11:06.665
to tell your gay kid
when you come out to them,

11:06.667 --> 11:08.667
like, how proud you are of them?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.669
I'm pretty sure it's in
the gay parent handbook.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.037
They must've lost the handbook.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.774
I can only come out to them
once in my whole life,

11:15.776 --> 11:18.843
and they freaking ruined it
for me with their kindness

11:18.845 --> 11:21.913
and blatant disregard
for my feelings.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.952
Are you even listening to me?

11:27.954 --> 11:29.354
- Oh, no.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.122
Cassie's home.
I gotta go, bitch.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.058
Okay, babe. Sorry your
parents are amazing.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.860
Shit.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.029
Stop whatever
you're doing right now.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.998
We are going
to pizza hut buffet.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.001
I am going to commit carbicide.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.703
I mean, before you say anything,

11:44.705 --> 11:46.871
I know that pizza hut buffet
is not a thing anymore,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.807
rest in peace pizza hut buffet,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.341
but that doesn't mean
we can't just order

11:50.343 --> 11:52.711
like a bazillion pizzas
and pretend it's still a thing.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.212
- Right?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.214
This is not what it looks like.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.083
I know what
you must be thinking.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.086
MacKenzie, are you
watching lesbian porn?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.088
'Cause I told you that

12:03.090 --> 12:05.957
"Bridget Jones' diaphragm"
is not the same movie.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.826
No, I...

12:07.828 --> 12:10.161
Well, yes, but it's for a class.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.163
Really? What class?
I want in.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.165
Yeah, it's like
this women's studies class.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.867
I have to do this assignment

12:15.869 --> 12:19.070
on post colonial gentrification

12:19.072 --> 12:21.072
set in an urban landscape

12:21.074 --> 12:23.274
posing in lesbian film.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.143
Did you just take
everything you remembered

12:25.145 --> 12:27.112
from your art theory class
and mush it all together?

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
That is exactly what I just did.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.849
Hmm.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.184
Well, it looks like
you beat me to the carbicide.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.886
What happened?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.155
Dinner with my parents
was kind of a disaster.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.389
Really?
What happened?

12:39.325 --> 12:42.293
Uh, I just...

12:42.295 --> 12:44.295
I told them something,
and they did not take it

12:44.297 --> 12:45.997
the way that I thought
that they would.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.332
Your parents are like
the most supportive people

12:47.334 --> 12:48.466
I know.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.068
I know. It's the worst.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.036
What didn't they take
the right way?

12:55.374 --> 12:56.908
You know what?
It's nothing.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.110
How was dinner
with your parents?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.445
Well, I told them
i broke up with Matthew.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.148
- Oh, shit.
How'd that go?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.383
Um, well, I think

13:05.385 --> 13:08.086
after the hysterical crying
and screaming stopped

13:08.088 --> 13:10.054
that it actually
went pretty well.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.223
I got the chocolate explosion
cake for dessert.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.392
Fuck off.
That's a good one.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.162
- Did you bring me some?
- Mm-mm.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.496
Yeah.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.865
- Yeah.
- Hah.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.867
So are we gonna go

13:22.869 --> 13:25.370
or I guess we can just keep
watching lesbian porn.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.239
It's not lesbian porn.
It's lesbian film.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.109
It's art.
It's very different.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.278
Lesbian porn is gross.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.813
Yeah, I know.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.147
I don't even think
that the lesbians

13:36.149 --> 13:38.483
who do lesbian porn
are real lesbians.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.285
Well, like I saw this one
where they were,

13:40.287 --> 13:42.821
they were using a strap-on,
and then they like

13:42.823 --> 13:44.823
put on a condom on it
and I was like, "why?"

13:44.825 --> 13:47.158
Why would you...
Why would you do that?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.860
Extra protection, obviously.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.362
Well, I will stick
to my normal porn.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.865
One-legged paraplegics
and Asian tentacles,

13:53.867 --> 13:55.366
- thank you very much.
- Hmm.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.373
I'm watching all the sex scenes
in lesbian movies, mom,

14:02.375 --> 14:04.909
are you gonna call me a pervert?

14:04.911 --> 14:07.412
Damn it, mom!
Call me a pervert.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.293
Isn't it weird how different
your life turned out

14:22.295 --> 14:24.162
than the way you had planned?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.031
Trust me, I know.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.900
What did you want to be again
when you grew up?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.902
- A ninja turtle?
- No!

14:30.904 --> 14:32.570
I wanted to be
the red power ranger.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.572
- How could you forget?
- Oh, yeah.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.441
Right.
How could I?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.142
You were the only girl
who didn't want to be

14:38.144 --> 14:40.278
the pink power ranger.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.614
Well, the red one
was obviously the coolest

14:42.616 --> 14:44.616
and the leader so.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.618
And the hottest.

14:46.620 --> 14:47.620
Right.

14:50.489 --> 14:53.024
It's like I thought I knew
what I was doing with my life.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.026
You know, like, i had a plan

14:55.028 --> 14:57.195
and I wrote it out on paper.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.529
I didn't even put it
in my phone.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.531
Like, I killed a tree for it.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.901
I know. It hangs on our
fridge, mocking me

15:02.903 --> 15:04.969
for not having a plan.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.506
Then Matthew
had to go and propose

15:08.508 --> 15:10.441
and screw everything up.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.979
Now look at me.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.347
You're a walking disaster.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.917
You are lucky I'm still
friends with you.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.423
I think I'm having
an anxiety attack.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.692
I don't really know, because I've
never really had one before,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.494
but I think that's what's
happening right now.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.529
- Are you having trouble breathing?
- No.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.531
Do you feel super nervous?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.567
No.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.305
I don't think you know
what an anxiety attack is.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.307
Maybe there are different
forms of anxiety attacks.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.574
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.112
I don't know. It's just,
like, my whole life I thought

15:48.114 --> 15:50.448
that I wanted a traditional
life, you know?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.717
Like, get married and have kids,

15:52.719 --> 15:56.187
and, I don't know, have a dog
that wears like a tiny hat.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.622
Yeah.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.958
I mean you can still
have a traditional life.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.459
- You know that.
- I don't know.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.428
Maybe I don't want
a traditional life.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.297
You know, like, maybe
i wanna be promiscuous

16:06.299 --> 16:09.968
and get hpv, I don't know,
the sky's the limit.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.403
I think hpv's, like,
really common now.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.306
You can get crazier than that.
You should go for the clap.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.579
Hey, Cassie.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.515
I've gotta tell you something,
and please don't freak out.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.285
But...

16:33.525 --> 16:34.692
Oh, my god.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.997
Oh, you know.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.201
Oh, shit, you know.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.637
I've made a huge mistake.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.507
My parents were right.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.710
Okay. Clearly you're having
a mental breakdown

16:52.712 --> 16:55.646
because your parents
are never right.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.582
You weren't ready to get
married, which is good,

16:57.584 --> 16:59.417
because you're 22.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.619
Who the fuck gets
married at 22, cass?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.354
Rednecks, that's who.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.790
Maybe I wanna be a redneck.

17:05.791 --> 17:08.126
Okay, then go be a redneck.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.127
I don't wanna be a redneck.

17:19.570 --> 17:23.040
I think I know what's going
to make you feel better.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.108
Do you remember when
i dated Andrew?

17:25.111 --> 17:27.045
- Eww, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.114
And he had, like,
the tiniest dick ever?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.417
Yeah, you said it was an innie.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.186
It was. It was
a fucking innie.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.722
I mean, I have not seen
a lot of dicks in my lifetime,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.657
but that one was tiny.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.459
It was so small

17:41.461 --> 17:44.162
that when it got scared it
would just like, disappear.

17:44.164 --> 17:48.533
It would like, retreat until
there was no penis left.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.436
I've never even heard
of a dick that small.

17:53.273 --> 17:58.176
I mean, I guess technically,
i never even lost my virginity.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.812
So, I'm still a virgin.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.714
Who's more pathetic now?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.716
This one.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.420
You're a 22-year-old virgin.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.590
Priests have had
more sex than I have.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.728
Maybe my life isn't so bad.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.464
Yeah.

18:23.368 --> 18:26.104
Hey, why did you tell
me not to freak out?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.376
Just, like, don't freak out

18:32.378 --> 18:34.612
because your life's
not that bad.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.117
Oh, right.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.120
Thanks, bud.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.130
Okay, which one should I wear?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.298
Is this a joke?
They look identical.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.468
This one's a tri-blend,
and this one's a poly-cotton.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.303
God, you're such
a lesbian sometimes.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.373
Fine, the one on the right.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.376
I don't know. This one
reeks of desperation.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.811
I'm going
with the poly-cotton.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.579
I don't even know why you
bother asking me.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.182
I have literally worn this
shirt for, like, a week now.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.783
I just keep on, like,
dousing it in perfume

19:12.785 --> 19:14.318
to hide my b.O.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.486
My god, you're disgusting.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.388
I'm single.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.757
I don't know what you would
do if you didn't have me.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.729
Oh, here we go.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.864
"Tum-blur"?

19:26.866 --> 19:29.300
Tumblr.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.868
It's the new Facebook
for lesbians.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.471
Hell, it's the new eharmony
for lesbians.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.274
I have a pinterest account.
Can I just use that?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.943
No, are you a 50-year-old mom
or planning your wedding?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.646
No. Delete that account
immediately.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.248
I'm, like, embarrassed for you.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.485
Okay, so, let's create
your profile.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.953
You're totes adorbs.
So, trust me, the ladies

19:48.955 --> 19:50.755
are gonna be all over you.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.256
Okay.

19:52.258 --> 19:56.460
I have to pick a theme.
How about sports?

19:56.462 --> 19:57.528
Oh, my god, perfect.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.530
Lesbians love sports.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.598
How do you know all this stuff?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.866
Tumblr, duh.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.738
Hey, I'm MacKenzie,

20:07.740 --> 20:11.909
recently out, just turned 22.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.712
I like comics,

20:14.714 --> 20:18.783
puppies, and astronomy.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.419
I love you.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.853
Yeah, that's all I got.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.589
Whatever, nobody reads
that stuff anyways.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.524
They're more interested
in your selfies.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.426
- Gimme your phone.
- Oh.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.760
Mmm.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.464
Okay, do, like,
a sexy pouty face,

20:33.466 --> 20:35.266
but look like you aren't trying.

20:36.535 --> 20:37.835
Can you like crinkle
your nose a little bit?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.403
More lips.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.906
Like you're not taking
a shit though.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.474
Now smile through your eyes.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.875
Oh god, less smizing.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.845
Eww. They just keep
getting worse.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.781
Okay, maybe I can find a decent
picture you already took

20:50.783 --> 20:51.916
and then make it look
better on instagram.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.386
- Okay.
- Okay, umm...

20:57.990 --> 21:00.625
Oh, this one.
This is perfect.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.629
Okay, I'm just going
to crop Cassie out.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.733
Voila, it's live.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.569
I'll give it a week, and you'll have
a tumblr girlfriend in no time.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.006
So, how's Cassie?

21:15.008 --> 21:16.941
I haven't seen
that bitch in weeks.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.442
She's good.
She's been really busy

21:18.444 --> 21:20.411
with her internship
and school stuff.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.013
And, how'd she take
it when you told her?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.382
Told her what?

21:25.484 --> 21:27.852
That you decided
to join the lpga.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.323
I have not told her yet.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.758
I'm sorry, what?

21:34.693 --> 21:37.628
I mean, she's gotta know.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.863
She has to know.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.564
I mean, look at you.

21:40.566 --> 21:43.367
I'm pretty good at hiding
my lesbianism, Levi.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.069
I've been doing it for 22 years.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.505
Oh, honey, no.
No, you haven't.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.408
Well, whatever.
Cassie doesn't know.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.475
Well, what are you waiting for?

21:51.477 --> 21:52.476
She's your best friend.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.844
She isn't gonna care.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.413
I know that she's
not going to care,

21:55.415 --> 21:57.081
it's just...

21:57.083 --> 21:59.550
I don't know.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.586
I'm worried about making
things change between us.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.889
Like, what if she
does get weirded out?

22:06.491 --> 22:07.792
I'm worried about
screwing things up.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.694
You're being way too dramatic.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.862
Trust me, she isn't gonna care.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.998
I mean, it's worse
that you're lying to her.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.400
I'm not lying to her,

22:16.402 --> 22:18.903
I just haven't
told her the truth.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.604
Tell her.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.607
You don't want her finding
out from somebody else.

22:23.609 --> 22:28.112
And besides, I'm sure she
knows you're a hundred footer.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.481
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

22:35.388 --> 22:37.421
Why do lesbians like this stuff?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.392
I have no clothes.
I have nothing.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.860
Looks to me like you're
wearing clothes.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.562
I need to go shopping.
What are you doing today?

22:44.564 --> 22:46.764
Nothing. And, no, I will
not go shopping with you.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.999
Yes, you are.
I can't go by myself.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.935
Call Levi, he misses you.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.970
Plus, I'm sure I'm sure he
wants any excuse to skip class.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.072
I did call Levi and he's busy.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.708
- So, I'm your backup?
- You're always my backup.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.444
Well, find someone else
because I am not going.

23:00.446 --> 23:01.946
- Yes, you're going.
- No, I'm not.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.748
I'll buy you a pretzel.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.818
Love it.
Yellow is so your color.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.121
Buy it, let's go.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.856
I don't know if I like
the pattern.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.159
Oh, like, that's
the style I want.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.530
Yeah, her pant-top
combination was just great,

23:19.532 --> 23:20.798
and then with the shoes,

23:20.800 --> 23:22.433
it just came together
really nicely.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.635
You're right, I should have
brought Levi.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.036
Duh.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.443
Oh, what about this one?

23:32.445 --> 23:34.412
I love them all.
I'm so bored.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.514
My legs hurt, i wanna sit down.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.882
I did not buy you a pretzel

23:37.884 --> 23:39.550
so you could complain
the whole time.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.185
This is the thousandth
store we've been in.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.020
I don't even know what
you're looking for anymore.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.122
Dresses, pants, shoes,
you've tried on everything.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.924
I just got out of
a serious relationship.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.560
I need to get rid of things
that remind me of Matthew.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.029
So, everything.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.631
Yes.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.965
I want a cinnamon bun, too.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.803
- Fine.
- Yes.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.037
Hmm.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.494
I don't know, I'll just
try on both of them.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.517
Is it too summery?

24:13.519 --> 24:14.852
I don't know, it's hot out,

24:14.854 --> 24:16.587
so I don't think you're
going to be cold in that.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.122
Yeah, but it's spring.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.492
- So? -So, is it too
summery for spring?

24:21.494 --> 24:22.960
I'm so lost right now.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.130
I don't know.
I think it's too summery.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.532
I'm going to try
on the other one.

24:28.534 --> 24:32.536
Okay. No problem, I'll just
stand here, dying of hunger.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.743
Mac.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.146
Hi, how are you?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.248
Matthew, my clothes.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.617
Yeah, here.

24:53.258 --> 24:57.094
So, uh, are you
with Cassie here?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.696
Uh...

24:59.998 --> 25:01.232
I don't know?

25:03.168 --> 25:06.670
What?
You... you don't know?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.006
What about this one,
but with, like, a belt?

25:11.276 --> 25:13.143
Uh...

25:14.079 --> 25:15.779
Hi.

25:17.716 --> 25:18.782
Hi.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.084
I don't know about this one.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.519
Do I look fuckable?

25:21.521 --> 25:24.121
Like who would
fuck me in this? No one.

25:26.224 --> 25:29.927
No one would fuck you
in that dress.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.666
That was, like, really weird.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.104
How long are you going to be?

25:43.875 --> 25:47.711
Your little cousin seems
like a wonderful person.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.215
She... she's not my...
My cousin.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.651
Uh, MacKenzie, could you
come in here for a sec?

25:53.653 --> 25:56.887
I, uh, think my dress is stuck.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.998
Why did you let me
try on this dress?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.199
I look like an idiot.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.768
I told you to bring Levi.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.570
I don't know anything
about this shit.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.904
I only came for
the god damn pretzel

26:13.906 --> 26:15.172
that was promised to me.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.840
Who the fuck
is that girl he's with?

26:16.842 --> 26:18.142
I'd take a wild guess

26:18.144 --> 26:19.977
and say it's his new girlfriend.

26:19.979 --> 26:23.814
So nice of him to wait like
five minutes after I dump him.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.050
Don't worry,
she's just a rebound girl.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.284
She seems dumb as fuck

26:27.286 --> 26:29.320
and a total
high-maintenance bitch.

26:29.322 --> 26:34.124
Oh, wait he dated you,
so you should worry.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.294
Guess who just got
their cinnamon bun taken away.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.963
You wouldn't.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.866
God, I can't believe
he saw me in this dress.

26:42.868 --> 26:45.235
You're just gonna change?
Okay, great.

26:46.671 --> 26:47.905
Are they still out there?

26:49.274 --> 26:50.808
Yeah.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.077
We are staying in here
until they leave.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.479
Oh, yeah, because that's not
going to look weird or anything.

26:57.749 --> 27:00.751
Can I use your phone to swipe
left to get rid of the uglies?

27:07.325 --> 27:09.059
Ugh.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.794
Eh.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.231
Oh, god.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.352
You wanted to speak with me?

27:40.859 --> 27:42.426
I heard you broke up
with your boyfriend.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.061
I know that's probably why

27:44.063 --> 27:45.696
your grades have been slipping.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.298
That is so unbelievably
creepy that you know that.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.401
I know you're smarter than that,

27:50.403 --> 27:52.036
so I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.405
Okay, thanks.

27:54.407 --> 27:55.873
Just a reminder, though,

27:55.875 --> 27:57.675
you won't be
graduating in spring

27:57.677 --> 27:59.343
if you fail one more assignment,

27:59.345 --> 28:01.345
because then you're going
to fail this class.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.414
Are you shitting me,
Dr. Reese?

28:03.416 --> 28:04.915
So when you told me
not to worry,

28:04.917 --> 28:06.050
you actually meant
that I should worry?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.419
Maybe Matthew can tutor you.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.120
We broke up.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.822
Oh, that's right.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.258
That's where this
conversation began.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.161
Okay, thank you for this talk.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.129
Look, my door is always open

28:19.131 --> 28:21.932
during my designated
office hours.

28:21.934 --> 28:25.903
That's 7:00 to 8:00 A.M. every
first Saturday of the month.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.739
Cool.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.781
Hey.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.883
Hi.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.252
Okay, so, you need
to help me out.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.121
My teammates over there...
Don't look.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.789
They bet me twenty bucks that

28:45.791 --> 28:47.958
I couldn't get your number.
Don't look!

28:47.960 --> 28:50.227
And like, not only do i
really want the twenty bucks,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.863
but they're always
making fun of me

28:52.865 --> 28:55.332
because I always
blow it with girls

28:55.334 --> 28:56.834
and they think I need
a girlfriend

28:56.836 --> 28:58.335
or just like more experience,

28:58.337 --> 29:00.871
and now I'm completely
over-sharing,

29:00.873 --> 29:03.207
so if you could
like laugh really loud

29:03.209 --> 29:05.175
and pretend I've said
something super funny

29:05.177 --> 29:08.112
and maybe look like you're
thinking about being into me...

29:08.114 --> 29:10.114
They bet that you
couldn't get my number?

29:10.116 --> 29:11.949
Yeah, well, a straight girl's.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.417
You think I'm straight?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.385
So, can you give me your number?

29:15.387 --> 29:18.021
Or a number? I promise I'm not
going to text you or anything.

29:18.023 --> 29:21.492
Yeah. Well, I actually
have this number

29:21.494 --> 29:23.060
that's like this
fake phone number,

29:23.062 --> 29:24.828
that you give to people
when they hit on you.

29:24.830 --> 29:25.829
And you don't wanna actually
give them your number,

29:25.831 --> 29:27.364
and then they call it

29:27.366 --> 29:29.233
and it's like this
voicemail that's like,

29:29.235 --> 29:32.770
"the person you're calling
gave you a fake phone number.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.272
I hope you feel like
a giant loser, loser."

29:35.274 --> 29:37.007
No way, that's not a thing.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.009
I swear to god.
I use it all the time.

29:40.411 --> 29:43.380
I say "all the time"
like I get hit on all the time.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.216
In reality I've used
it like seven times.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.052
Six times.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.854
I've used it three times.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.057
Wow, and I thought you were
going to be all sweet and stuff

29:54.059 --> 29:56.393
with your cute
little packed lunch

29:56.395 --> 29:58.896
and your adorable
little backpack.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.865
I mean you're eating
peanut butter and jelly.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.233
Girls that destroy egos

30:03.235 --> 30:05.335
do not eat peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.004
Oh, no, no, they do.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.272
Yeah, they eat peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

30:08.274 --> 30:09.594
and they drink out
of juice boxes.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.844
To be fair, though, I usually
only give that number to guys

30:13.846 --> 30:16.547
because one, they're usually
the only ones that hit on me

30:16.549 --> 30:20.384
and two, I'm not into them.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.020
Oh, I thought...

30:23.022 --> 30:26.990
So, yeah, I will give
you my number.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.396
But, you know, only because
i want you to win that bet.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.966
Yeah, totally just
to win the bet.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.868
I'm gonna throw this number away

30:37.870 --> 30:39.403
as soon as I get
my twenty bucks.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.139
I'm not gonna stare at it
or put it in my phone

30:42.141 --> 30:43.974
or like, text you later.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.609
That's definitely
not gonna happen.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.378
Good, because I wouldn't
want you to text me,

30:48.380 --> 30:50.247
and I obviously would
not text you back.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.883
Duh, and then when you
don't text me back,

30:52.885 --> 30:55.085
I don't have to ask
you if you want

30:55.087 --> 30:57.054
to go get dinner or see
a movie together.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.089
Good, because I definitely...

30:59.091 --> 31:03.560
Definitely wouldn't say yes
to any of that.

31:03.562 --> 31:06.930
Just so we're on the same page.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.565
We are on the same page.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.049
Hiya, hi, how's it going?

31:26.051 --> 31:29.286
Hey, uh, everything's great.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.022
Um, yeah, I just saw the e-mail
you sent to the client,

31:32.024 --> 31:34.658
and I noticed you did not
sign it, "kindest regards."

31:35.493 --> 31:36.560
So?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.964
Yeah, so, obviously I don't
care, it's just that

31:40.966 --> 31:42.966
remember on the first day
you started working here

31:42.968 --> 31:44.334
and I told you we always
sign our e-mails

31:44.336 --> 31:46.136
with "kindest regards"?

31:46.138 --> 31:49.072
Yeah, I thought that was
just a suggestion.

31:49.074 --> 31:52.109
Oh, yeah, it is, um,
it's just like one of those

31:52.111 --> 31:54.211
suggestions that
you always wanna do.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.079
So, I'm sure it's fine,

31:56.081 --> 32:00.250
it's just I think our boss
is really upset with you.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.688
Are you fucking with me?

32:04.690 --> 32:05.989
What?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.458
I don't even.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.998
Oh, my god, it's so shitty.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.601
What is it, Amy?

32:18.536 --> 32:20.270
You didn't get the e-mail?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.972
What e-mail?

32:21.974 --> 32:25.042
Oh, my god, it's so awkward,

32:25.044 --> 32:28.445
um, you just got fired.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.580
I'm pretty sure you got cced.

32:32.483 --> 32:34.518
I got fired?

32:34.520 --> 32:37.220
Yeah, total bummer.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.456
I mean, because, like,
you're just an intern

32:39.458 --> 32:41.458
and who fires an intern?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.494
Because you don't even get paid.

32:46.998 --> 32:50.634
This has gotta be
some kind of joke, right?

32:52.603 --> 32:55.038
Is this because
of "kindest regards"?

32:55.040 --> 32:59.443
Oh, my god, no.
I mean, maybe?

32:59.445 --> 33:04.147
Um, but you should probably
start packing up your things.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.217
Um, oh, but not
until after lunch,

33:07.219 --> 33:09.753
because you need to
still go get that, okay?

33:13.257 --> 33:15.692
- Cassie.
- What, Amy?

33:15.694 --> 33:18.228
Isn't this your
friend, MacKenzie?

33:19.163 --> 33:21.732
I've been reading her blog.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.001
She's hilarious.

33:24.003 --> 33:27.471
I just love her
positive outlook on life.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.006
Is she single?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.277
Cassie.

33:36.214 --> 33:39.349
You're probably wondering why
i have developed a fondness for

33:39.351 --> 33:42.619
baseball and lesbian film
in the past couple of weeks.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.023
It's because it's come to my
attention, currently, that...

33:46.025 --> 33:47.457
Dude, what the fuck?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.259
What do you mean what the fuck?
You what the fuck.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.761
You almost broke my face.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.162
How could you?

33:52.164 --> 33:54.164
I thought we were best friends.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.732
What are you talking about?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.701
Oh, I don't know, MacKenzie,

33:57.703 --> 34:00.704
maybe you could have
told me that you're gay?

34:00.706 --> 34:04.274
Yeah, you told everyone in
the fucking world except for me.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.676
Fucking Levi,
I'm going to murder him.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.112
No, it wasn't Levi, you idiot.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.514
You put it on your blog.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.581
You can see my blog?

34:12.583 --> 34:16.219
First of all, everyone in the
world can see your blog.

34:16.221 --> 34:20.056
Second of all, i work in social media,
so it's my job to be on tumblr.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.092
- Oh.
- Yeah, oh.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.730
Why didn't you tell me?

34:36.674 --> 34:40.377
Look, I'm sorry. I just... I
wasn't ready to tell you.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.712
You have pooped
in front of me, MacKenzie.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.380
I have seen you poop.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.183
And you couldn't just
tell me you were gay.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.650
I know!

34:47.652 --> 34:49.493
I mean, okay, that's
not really the same thing.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.357
- Did you think I was going to care?
- No.

34:54.359 --> 34:57.394
Then I don't get why
you didn't just tell me.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.696
Okay, I've never kept
anything from you.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.833
I know.
I just... I wasn't ready.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.702
But you were just ready to splash
it all across the Internet.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.238
Okay, Levi was the one
that made me get a tumblr,

35:08.240 --> 35:08.238
so don't even start with that.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.674
I don't even know
how to use the thing.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.209
Yeah, I noticed, okay?

35:12.211 --> 35:13.777
You're not even
tagging your photos.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.480
I don't know how you expect
anyone to follow you.

35:16.482 --> 35:19.649
Yeah, see, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.519
That still doesn't explain
why you didn't just tell me.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.523
Do you know how much it hurt
finding out online,

35:26.525 --> 35:27.524
rather than just from you?

35:27.526 --> 35:29.559
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.628
I am sorry
that I didn't tell you

35:31.630 --> 35:33.697
and you found out
on the Internet.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.599
But this, for once,
is not about you.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.801
It's about me.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.903
I decide when
i want to come out.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.840
I decide when I tell my parents
or Levi, or you.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.909
Me, not you.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.678
Have you told Levi
or your parents?

35:50.848 --> 35:52.582
Yes?

35:54.519 --> 35:57.254
What the fuck, dude?

35:58.856 --> 36:01.224
You're taking this way
out of proportion.

36:01.226 --> 36:04.294
I think this shows
that I care about you the most.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.929
I was the most worried
to tell you.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.430
Does that not mean
anything to you?

36:07.432 --> 36:09.199
No, it doesn't.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.834
Because I should be
the one you come to

36:10.836 --> 36:12.736
when something this important
is happening in your life.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.206
Not Levi.
Not your parents. Me.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.808
And to know that you
can't even talk to me

36:18.810 --> 36:20.710
about something this
important then...

36:22.513 --> 36:24.913
I don't even know what the point
of being friends is anymore.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.257
Oh, this is fucked up.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.928
You're making this fucked up.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.967
Fine. Be silent.
Whatever, I'm over it.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.968
I can't take this anymore.
I feel like I've lost you.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.670
It's been 12 hours.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.473
Well, it feels like years
to me, okay?

37:56.475 --> 37:59.643
I wanna talk about this and
you're the one being an asshole.

37:59.645 --> 38:03.613
- Oh, I'm an asshole?
- Yes, you are an asshole.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.548
The whole reason I didn't
tell you I was gay

38:05.550 --> 38:07.584
was because of this... exactly
what you're doing right now.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.352
What am I doing right now?

38:09.354 --> 38:11.855
You're making things
between us weird and awkward.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.398
I'm not mad because you're gay.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.300
I'm mad because
you didn't tell me.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.336
Do you know how hard
it is to come out?

38:26.338 --> 38:30.940
- Obviously not.
- Exactly. Obviously not.

38:30.942 --> 38:34.611
I'm not going to apologize again
for not telling you sooner.

38:34.613 --> 38:38.315
Look, things have been really
rough for me, okay?

38:38.317 --> 38:40.417
My parents are
overly supportive,

38:40.419 --> 38:42.219
Levi's trying to whore me out,

38:43.621 --> 38:46.489
and believe it or not, it's
actually been really difficult

38:46.491 --> 38:48.825
not talking to you
about this all.

38:50.728 --> 38:51.928
I guess I'm just upset with...

38:51.930 --> 38:54.597
The way things are going
in my life.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.768
I just needed someone
to take it out on.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.937
Well, take it out
on your parents,

39:00.939 --> 39:02.499
that's obviously
what they're there for.

39:09.113 --> 39:10.814
Are we okay?

39:13.617 --> 39:15.118
Yeah, we're okay.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.555
Because it doesn't feel
like we're okay.

39:18.557 --> 39:21.958
- Okay, well we're going
to be okay, okay? -Okay.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.493
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.362
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.799
I've said "okay" so much
in the past minute,

39:29.801 --> 39:31.801
I don't even know
what it means anymore.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.405
Yeah.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.681
No.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.850
- So, straight.
- Mm-hmm.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.585
- Straight.
- Mm-hmm.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.488
Unfortunately, straight.

39:53.491 --> 39:55.925
Uh, gay.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.763
Um, gay, gay,

39:59.765 --> 40:02.632
straight?

40:02.634 --> 40:05.635
No, those were all
straight girls, hon.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.704
How can you tell
just by looking at them?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.172
Years of practice, darling.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.808
I have my gaydar perfected.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.844
- Okay, see the girl over by the tree?
- Yeah.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.446
Gay.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.168
How can you tell that
all the way from here?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.618
I can.
Okay. Try again.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.553
Um...

40:23.555 --> 40:24.554
Hey.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.855
Hey, bitch.

40:25.857 --> 40:26.856
Finished for the day?

40:26.858 --> 40:27.991
- Yep.
- Nice.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.659
What are you guys up to?

40:29.661 --> 40:31.961
Just trying to teach our
little baby dyke over here

40:31.963 --> 40:33.630
how to use her gaydar.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.112
I think I'm getting
really good at it.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.033
No.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.569
Well, who are we looking at?
Can I try?

40:39.571 --> 40:41.070
Why? You're straight.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.506
I don't know.
Maybe to save me from another

40:43.508 --> 40:45.942
15 years of crushing
on Lance bass.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.777
Bless him.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.880
Is it um...

40:50.882 --> 40:52.649
That's what I thought.

40:52.651 --> 40:53.950
Who texted you?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.485
Elliot.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.654
Been texting her
for like two weeks, nonstop.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.456
You don't know that it's Elliot.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.458
I mean, a lot of people text me,

41:01.460 --> 41:05.862
like you or Cassie or my mother.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.130
Did your mom text you?

41:08.065 --> 41:09.065
No.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.034
Thought so.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.902
Who's Elliot?

41:12.904 --> 41:15.104
Elliot, I told you about her.
I met her after class one day.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.940
No, you never mentioned her.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.741
Oh, well, I mean,
it's no big deal.

41:18.743 --> 41:22.712
I met a girl, her name
is Elliot and that's it.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.113
And she wants to ride her face.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.815
Well, maybe just a little.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.551
- She plays soccer.
- You hate sports.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.954
I like girls who play sports,

41:30.956 --> 41:32.822
and that's all that matters.

41:34.859 --> 41:36.626
You should invite her
to our party on Saturday.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.161
Yeah? I really want you
guys to meet her.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.929
I think you'll love her.

41:39.931 --> 41:42.131
She's so cool. I mean,
obviously not as cool as me,

41:42.133 --> 41:44.100
but like, who is?

41:46.036 --> 41:48.137
Gay, straight, gay?

41:52.043 --> 41:54.944
- Damn it.
- So not even close.

43:20.164 --> 43:21.998
I'm thinking of ordering
a pizza.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.299
What do you want on your half?

43:23.301 --> 43:27.103
I'm not really that hungry.
I probably won't have any.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.072
But you're always hungry.

43:37.181 --> 43:38.247
Hey.

43:39.183 --> 43:42.118
Yeah. Right now? Nothing.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.654
Yeah, I'm starving, obviously.

43:44.656 --> 43:46.189
I'll meet you there
in like ten minutes.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.224
Oh, you're coming
to the party tonight, right?

44:06.377 --> 44:09.412
Oh, my god, MacKenzie.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.716
Where did all these
people come from?

44:13.718 --> 44:16.386
I don't know. Only like ten
people said they were coming.

44:18.355 --> 44:20.390
I may have texted
a few extra people.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.392
I mean, ten people's
a gathering, ladies.

44:22.394 --> 44:24.360
This is a party.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.696
Can we get some Beyonce in here?

44:30.768 --> 44:32.235
Oh, my god.

44:32.237 --> 44:34.804
- Why the fuck are they here?
- To ruin your life.

44:34.806 --> 44:36.305
I can't believe he brought her.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.741
Well, I mean I can,
because they're dating.

44:38.743 --> 44:40.009
But you know what I mean.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.711
This is unbelievable.

44:41.713 --> 44:44.881
Has she even gotten her
period yet? She looks 12.

44:44.883 --> 44:46.315
Give me this.

44:48.252 --> 44:49.318
Eww, what was that?

44:49.320 --> 44:51.254
Peach schnapps.

44:51.256 --> 44:53.122
Oh, my god,
you are such a lesbian.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.225
Where's your lover?

44:56.227 --> 44:57.727
She isn't my lover,

44:57.729 --> 44:59.929
because we haven't
"lovered" yet.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.964
She's playing beer pong.

45:01.966 --> 45:04.100
Why don't you go talk to her?

45:04.102 --> 45:07.103
I don't know.
I don't want to bother her.

45:10.074 --> 45:12.241
Oh!

45:14.845 --> 45:16.913
Where did you even find that?

45:16.915 --> 45:19.248
Yolo, bitches!

45:20.350 --> 45:23.052
Please don't ever
say that again.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.320
You are white.

46:05.797 --> 46:07.830
Hey, I'm gonna let you
have this one.

46:07.832 --> 46:10.800
- Let me have it? I won it
fair and square. -Yes.

46:10.802 --> 46:14.103
- The beer pong trophy, -but need I
remind you this is the only time,

46:14.105 --> 46:17.006
- you've ever beaten me. -Is
ripped out of your dead hands...

46:17.008 --> 46:19.041
And the sex is so great.

46:19.043 --> 46:20.443
Mind if we sit down?

46:21.378 --> 46:23.880
Yeah, sure.

46:28.552 --> 46:31.788
Oh, sorry. Promise, I didn't
know what I was gonna do.

46:31.790 --> 46:33.956
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Okay, bye.

46:41.165 --> 46:44.033
Uh, hey.

46:44.902 --> 46:46.402
Hey.

46:47.337 --> 46:49.205
Are you feeling okay?

46:49.207 --> 46:51.107
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.444
Cool.

47:03.420 --> 47:04.987
Where the fuck did you go?

47:10.527 --> 47:12.495
So, Tasha.

47:13.530 --> 47:16.332
- It is Tasha, right?
- Yeah.

47:17.534 --> 47:18.901
What's your major?

47:18.903 --> 47:20.403
Bachelor of arts.

47:20.405 --> 47:22.071
Oh, cool.

47:22.073 --> 47:24.207
- In what?
- College.

47:40.190 --> 47:41.924
Love you, bye.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.066
- Hey.
- Hi.

47:50.068 --> 47:51.434
You good?

47:53.036 --> 47:55.872
Yes, I'm good. We already
had that conversation.

47:55.874 --> 47:57.540
Right, yeah.

47:58.976 --> 48:00.543
Are you okay?

48:00.545 --> 48:01.911
Yeah.

48:02.646 --> 48:04.046
Okay then.

48:21.498 --> 48:23.299
What the fuck is
MacKenzie doing?

48:23.301 --> 48:25.201
Does she have diarrhea
or something?

48:26.403 --> 48:28.037
Eww.

48:44.554 --> 48:47.523
Just so you know,
i have no idea what I'm doing.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.425
Honestly, neither do I.

48:49.993 --> 48:51.427
Cool.

48:56.199 --> 48:59.568
- Hey, bitch.
- Save me, bitch. Save me.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.579
Who the fuck are you?

49:10.581 --> 49:13.249
I'm Tasha.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.418
I don't fucking care.

49:16.987 --> 49:18.454
Where's MacKenzie?

49:18.456 --> 49:21.023
I don't know. She has
diarrhea or something.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.260
Ew, ew, ew.

49:24.262 --> 49:27.563
- No, no, no.
- I can save her.

49:37.374 --> 49:38.574
Get the fuck out.

49:38.576 --> 49:41.043
Hey, not while you
have diarrhea.

49:41.045 --> 49:42.979
I don't have diarrhea.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.747
I don't.

49:44.749 --> 49:48.217
This is my third beer and I'm
not even feeling anything.

49:49.753 --> 49:51.087
I'm such a tank.

49:53.090 --> 49:54.623
I hate being a tank.

49:56.126 --> 49:57.326
I want liquor.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.731
Go get me liquor.

50:01.733 --> 50:05.067
Right, sorry.
Yep, liquor.

50:07.537 --> 50:11.273
So, who are you? Do you,
like, go to this school?

50:11.275 --> 50:12.675
I'm Cassie.

50:14.611 --> 50:16.679
Matthew's ex, Cassie.

50:16.681 --> 50:19.515
He's never mentioned a Cassie.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.784
We broke up like
three months ago.

50:21.786 --> 50:25.087
And he started dating you, like,
a second after I dumped him.

50:25.089 --> 50:26.722
I think I'm drunk.

50:28.625 --> 50:30.659
Ugh, all right.

50:31.428 --> 50:33.329
Bye, Kathy.

50:33.331 --> 50:35.164
Bye.

50:37.100 --> 50:38.200
Hey, hey.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.201
Where are you going?

50:39.203 --> 50:41.470
I just need some fresh air.

51:02.459 --> 51:04.326
- Hey.
- Oh, jeez.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.130
What are you doing here?

51:08.132 --> 51:10.132
Thought I'd keep you company.

51:10.134 --> 51:11.700
Do you want to talk?

51:11.702 --> 51:13.235
I'm good, thanks.

51:15.639 --> 51:17.206
Well, you seem upset.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.641
I'm fine.

51:32.489 --> 51:34.790
Just go the fuck inside, okay?

51:55.812 --> 51:58.247
Hey, it's mack, talk some wack.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.316
Ew, why did I just say that?

52:00.318 --> 52:02.451
MacKenzie, pick up.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.353
Okay, Matthew just
tried to kiss me,

52:04.355 --> 52:06.555
and he had disgusting
beer breath.

52:06.557 --> 52:10.526
And did you see that stupid, fucking
gay beard he's trying to grow?

52:10.528 --> 52:13.662
Shit. I'm sorry, was that
offensive to you?

52:13.664 --> 52:15.865
I don't know.

52:15.867 --> 52:19.401
And I just stab his stupid, fucking
preschool girlfriend in the face.

52:19.403 --> 52:20.870
And I'm pretty sure
I'm getting my period,

52:20.872 --> 52:25.674
so, would you please
just stop shitting

52:25.676 --> 52:28.177
and just meet me
at our bench, okay?

52:28.179 --> 52:29.445
I need you.

53:12.256 --> 53:13.956
She left this here last night.

53:13.958 --> 53:16.358
It's the only thing I'll ever
have of hers again.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.860
Oh, my god, give me details.

53:17.862 --> 53:20.863
Ugh, it was horrible.

53:20.865 --> 53:23.699
No, it wasn't even horrible,
because it was great.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.568
And then it was horrible.

53:25.570 --> 53:27.870
Why, what happened?

53:27.872 --> 53:29.438
Okay, I'm pretty sure
I'm only telling you this

53:29.440 --> 53:30.739
because I'm still drunk
from last night.

53:30.741 --> 53:32.208
Yeah, I can still smell
the peach schnapps

53:32.210 --> 53:33.475
on your breath, honey.

53:33.477 --> 53:34.910
It's kind of nasty.

53:34.912 --> 53:38.214
Okay, well, like,
we were making out on my bed

53:38.216 --> 53:40.649
- and things were going really
well, you know? -Yeah.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.551
- I was like taking
off her shirt, -oh.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.653
- And like touching her boobies and stuff.
- Go, girl.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.890
- And I was like, yeah, like,
I'm going to do this. -Right.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.759
I'm so gonna do this.
I'm going for it.

53:50.761 --> 53:54.697
- So then I stuck my finger in there.
- Right.

53:54.699 --> 53:57.533
And then I just left it.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.802
You just left what?

53:59.804 --> 54:01.870
My finger?

54:01.872 --> 54:04.773
I just let it sit there like
a motherfucking tampon.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.576
Oh, come on, are you just
going to stand there

54:07.578 --> 54:09.245
and not make fun
of our little homo?

54:09.247 --> 54:11.380
I don't know, Levi,
she's clearly retarded.

54:11.382 --> 54:12.848
I didn't know what
fingering was.

54:12.850 --> 54:15.284
I thought once it was
in there it was just over.

54:15.286 --> 54:16.819
Honey, I'm a gay man,

54:16.821 --> 54:18.787
and I know that's not how
you finger someone.

54:18.789 --> 54:21.657
What was the point of watching
all that lesbian porn then?

54:21.659 --> 54:23.659
I'm so embarrassed.

54:23.661 --> 54:24.927
You should be.

54:27.864 --> 54:30.933
And where the fuck did you
go last night, little missy?

54:30.935 --> 54:33.302
Leaving your own party
like a diva?

54:33.304 --> 54:34.436
I just had to get out.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.738
I couldn't deal with Matthew

54:35.740 --> 54:37.273
and his hooker girlfriend
anymore.

54:37.275 --> 54:39.842
They left pretty soon
after you ditched.

54:39.844 --> 54:41.377
Probably to bang.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.912
Thank you. That makes me
feel so much better.

54:43.914 --> 54:45.948
I don't get it.
You broke up with him.

54:45.950 --> 54:48.684
Do you want to get back
together or something?

54:48.686 --> 54:50.326
I don't know, it's just
like every time...

54:51.455 --> 54:53.355
- What, it's Elliot.
- Yeah.

54:53.357 --> 54:56.458
Hey, I didn't think I was ever
going to talk to you again.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.961
Would you believe me if I told
you that my finger fell asleep?

55:02.499 --> 55:04.600
Oh, that girl's in love.

55:04.602 --> 55:06.935
- It's adorable. -Yeah, and
it's totally selfish.

55:06.937 --> 55:09.371
Oh, don't even.

55:09.373 --> 55:11.640
MacKenzie finally
actually likes someone.

55:11.642 --> 55:12.875
You should just
be happy for her.

55:12.877 --> 55:15.711
I am happy for her.

55:15.713 --> 55:18.614
Just like, why does
she have to be so happy?

55:18.616 --> 55:21.650
- My life's in the shits.
- Oh my god.

55:21.652 --> 55:25.020
What? It's like she never has
time for me or us anymore.

55:25.022 --> 55:26.855
It's all about Elliot.

55:28.792 --> 55:30.526
What's so great about Elliot?

55:32.329 --> 55:33.862
She's not even funny.

55:33.864 --> 55:35.030
She has some great tits, though.

55:35.032 --> 55:36.865
I have great tits.

55:36.867 --> 55:39.735
Yeah, but MacKenzie's not
allowed to put those ones...

55:39.737 --> 55:41.403
In her mouth.

55:41.405 --> 55:44.406
- Girls are such pigs.
- I know, tell me about it.

55:46.109 --> 55:48.077
Dr. Reese, are you going
to ask me about Matthew again?

55:48.079 --> 55:49.712
Because I really don't
want to talk about him.

55:49.714 --> 55:51.914
No, I've all ready been
lectured by the Dean.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.750
Apparently, I crossed
some boundary.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.854
You know, I thought
it was incredibly creepy

55:58.856 --> 56:01.390
that he even knew about it.

56:01.392 --> 56:04.626
And I was just wondering what
your plans were for graduation.

56:04.628 --> 56:06.362
Any jobs lined up?

56:06.364 --> 56:09.031
Well, I got fired
from an internship,

56:09.033 --> 56:11.834
so the job pool is looking
a little shallow.

56:11.836 --> 56:13.936
You know,
i actually know someone

56:13.938 --> 56:16.138
who works at a creative agency

56:16.140 --> 56:20.876
and they are looking
for a junior copywriter.

56:20.878 --> 56:22.411
And I suggested you.

56:22.413 --> 56:25.447
- Are you serious?
- I am.

56:25.449 --> 56:26.715
Oh my god, that's amazing.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.951
The position starts pretty soon,

56:28.953 --> 56:31.653
- so it should be perfect for
when you graduate. -Okay.

56:31.655 --> 56:32.955
- They want to meet you.
- Okay.

56:32.957 --> 56:37.826
And this is the name
of the hr person,

56:37.828 --> 56:42.598
and the name
and contact information

56:42.600 --> 56:44.433
of the creative director.

56:46.102 --> 56:50.005
- Give them a call if you're interested.
- Okay, yeah.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.173
Wow.

56:52.942 --> 56:55.978
Dr. Reese, if you weren't like
an older version of my gbf,

56:55.980 --> 56:57.780
I would totally kiss
you right now.

57:03.119 --> 57:05.454
You have stickers
on your ceiling.

57:05.456 --> 57:07.556
What?

57:07.558 --> 57:11.994
Oh, yeah. Those are those,
you know, star stickers.

57:13.663 --> 57:14.730
What?

57:14.732 --> 57:16.098
You know, the star stickers

57:16.100 --> 57:18.834
of the solar system,
they glow in the dark.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.069
That's so embarrassing.

57:21.071 --> 57:24.540
- Oh. Oh, that's embarrassing?
- Mm-hmm.

57:24.542 --> 57:27.109
Me having the glow-in-the-dark
solar system is embarrassing,

57:27.111 --> 57:29.812
but me sticking my finger in your
vagina to take a nice cozy nap,

57:29.814 --> 57:31.914
that's not embarrassing.

57:31.916 --> 57:33.749
Whoa, who said that wasn't
embarrassing?

57:33.751 --> 57:35.717
That's even
more so embarrassing.

57:40.757 --> 57:42.624
So, can I kiss you now?

57:44.694 --> 57:47.463
Yeah. I think
we're past the point

57:47.465 --> 57:48.997
where you need to ask.

57:49.933 --> 57:51.667
Okay.

57:52.602 --> 57:53.969
Just checking.

58:03.681 --> 58:07.816
Let me just turn this off
really, really quickly.

58:09.552 --> 58:10.652
What's that?

58:10.654 --> 58:13.956
Oh, this is just my tumblr.

58:13.958 --> 58:15.057
You have a tumblr?

58:15.059 --> 58:17.226
Oh, yeah, I'm really gay.

58:19.662 --> 58:20.729
Who's that girl?

58:20.731 --> 58:22.531
Oh, that's shawntelle.

58:22.533 --> 58:23.532
Shawntelle?

58:23.534 --> 58:25.000
Yeah, she's my friend.

58:25.002 --> 58:28.804
Well, technically
she's my tumblr girlfriend.

58:30.974 --> 58:33.275
- You have a tumblr girlfriend?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?

58:33.277 --> 58:35.511
I don't even know what she looks
like in real life.

58:35.513 --> 58:37.613
I could be getting catfished
for all I know.

58:37.615 --> 58:39.781
She, like, lives in Texas
or something.

58:42.218 --> 58:43.952
What is happening right now?

58:43.954 --> 58:45.053
Are you leaving?

58:45.055 --> 58:46.922
Yes, mack, I'm leaving.

58:46.924 --> 58:49.157
Why? I thought we were gonna
go get ice cream.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.826
Because you have a girlfriend.

58:50.828 --> 58:52.561
A girl...?

58:52.563 --> 58:55.998
No, she's a tumblr girlfriend.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.833
She's probably 50 years old

58:57.835 --> 59:00.769
and has two mentally
challenged sons.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.848
Sorry to keep you.
I hope you weren't waiting.

59:12.850 --> 59:14.216
Oh, no, not at all.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.784
Hi, Cassie.

59:15.786 --> 59:17.819
Juliana.
Thanks. Have a seat.

59:20.023 --> 59:21.657
Cassie, where are you?

59:26.663 --> 59:30.732
Come on, pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.

59:33.337 --> 59:35.671
Hey, babes, I can't really
talk right now.

59:35.673 --> 59:37.739
I think I totally
fucked things up.

59:40.244 --> 59:42.177
What is... are you...

59:42.179 --> 59:44.012
Are you having sex right now?

59:44.014 --> 59:47.983
Yeah, babe, I told you I can't
really talk right now.

59:47.985 --> 59:49.351
It's a bad time.

59:50.286 --> 59:51.920
It's totally a good time.

59:51.922 --> 59:54.189
Why did you even
answer the phone?

59:54.191 --> 59:57.859
I'm bottoming, so it's not like
I'm really doing anything.

59:57.861 --> 01:00:00.329
I did not need to know that.

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:01.651
Call me back when
you're finished.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:06.068
Oh, oh, god. Now I'm just
thinking about you finishing.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.336
Okay, love you, babe.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.807
Hello? Just kidding.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.609
It's Cassie's voicemail.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.345
Mack, it's Cassie.
I mean, Cassie, it's mack.

01:00:16.347 --> 01:00:17.980
MacKenzie.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:20.148
I think Elliot just dumped
me because of my stupid,

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.084
fucking, shitty-ass
tumblr girlfriend

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.953
who doesn't even fucking exist.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.922
Like, why don't they tell you
in the terms and conditions

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:28.156
if you have a tumblr girlfriend

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:30.125
it apparently counts
as a real one.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.060
Like, how fucking stupid
is that?

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:33.729
What is even the point
of one of those?

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:36.865
To send song lyrics
and pictures back and forth to.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.134
Can I fuck one of those song
lyrics, Cassie?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.169
No, no, I can't.

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:43.405
I mean, technically I can't.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:46.208
Maybe like, emotionally I can,
somehow, or anyways.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.744
Elliot found out
and now she hates me.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.112
At least I think she does,
i don't know.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.780
She stormed out of here.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:57.119
I think I love her, Cassie.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:01:00.055
I mean, obviously, I don't
because it's been like a month

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:03.191
but I really, really, like her.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:05.761
You have to help me,
i don't know what to do.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.931
We need to win her back.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.934
Oh, yeah. I just said "we."
This is now a team effort.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:17.239
I'm gonna go get ice cream.
Meet me at our bench, you know?

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.908
Like, stop what you're doing
right now and come meet me.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.277
Like, right now.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.979
Okay, bye.

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:18.500
Hello? Just kidding,

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.102
it's Cassie's voicemail.

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:21.737
Seriously?

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.005
Seriously?

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.041
Just don't.
I don't want to hear it.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.843
What do you mean you
don't want to hear it?

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:30.746
I mean I don't want to hear
you complain about

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:32.214
whatever it is you're going
to complain about.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:35.217
I don't care.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.319
I don't care about
your problems, MacKenzie.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:41.289
And I especially don't care
about whatever it is

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.493
you did to fuck up your
relationship with Elliot.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:47.262
This might come as a shock,
but it is your duty

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.298
as my best friend
to care about these things.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.967
You have to listen
and let me vent

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.069
about whatever I want
to vent about.

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.771
So, if I want
to complain all day

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.173
about the stupid woman
in the snuggie commercial

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:00.275
who doesn't even know how to fucking
read with a blanket on her,

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.177
like, actually, if you're
having trouble reading

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:03.812
and keeping a blanket on you,

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:05.313
then you should have
your children taken away

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.048
because clearly you're not
fit to be a parent.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.451
Then you will agree
and you will vent with me,

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.020
because that is what
best friends do.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:14.956
No, it's not.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.992
That's not what
best friends do, MacKenzie.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:20.262
Best friends are honest
with each other.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.364
Best friends tell each other

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:25.967
when they think the other person's
being stupid and ridiculous.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:26.968
Did you hear that?

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.937
Best friends are honest.

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:34.843
Oh. Oh. Is that what
we're doing right now?

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:36.244
We're being honest
with each other.

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:39.214
Okay, yeah, sure,
i can be honest.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.550
Let's be honest.

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.157
This plan of yours,
this life plan,

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.394
is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:54.496
Like, what is the point of this?

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.498
Why do you still have this
hanging on our fridge?

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:03.872
Did you laminate
your fucking life plan?

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:07.075
At least I'm still thinking about
what kind of future I want.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:08.877
What are you even doing
with your life

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:11.046
besides getting catfished
on the Internet?

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:13.348
Oh, don't you bring
shawntelle into this.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:18.320
You are so self involved,
you didn't even notice

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:20.388
that I had a job interview today

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.058
for my dream job
at a creative agency.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.926
Okay, so maybe it wasn't
my dream job,

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.495
because my dream job involves
Ryan gosling feeding me grapes,

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.198
but it was still
a really good job.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.100
And you didn't even know

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.269
because if it doesn't have
anything to do with you,

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.570
you don't even care.

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:38.240
Really?
Really, Cassie?

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:40.442
You're calling me
self-involved?

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:41.943
How about this one?

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.312
You didn't even know
that I was gay.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:50.285
Everyone, literally everyone
could tell you,

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.220
but my furious lesbianism
didn't even faze you

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.923
because you're so wrapped
up in your head.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:57.192
You had a boyfriend.

01:04:57.194 --> 01:04:58.560
You were dating Andrew.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:00.295
So, how was I supposed to know?

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:04.966
Did you think that I actually
liked dating Andrew?

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.269
The only reason
that I dated him was

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:08.637
because his dick
was so fucking small

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:10.505
that it was pretty
much just a vagina.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:13.475
And as my best friend
you should know this.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:15.377
My god, you know what?

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.178
It was a mistake.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.181
17 years ago, when I saw
that you had beach time Ken,

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:23.652
and I had ball gown Barbie, and I
thought they could just get married,

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:25.220
and we could just play together.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:28.223
I had beach time Ken,

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:32.027
and you still didn't
know that I was gay.

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:35.630
You know what,
maybe this friendship

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.466
wasn't supposed
to last this long.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.435
Fine.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:45.707
I don't know if you
think I'm joking,

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:48.510
but I am being fucking serious.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:51.947
I am over this friendship.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:58.420
Okay.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:02.457
Then I hope you enjoy your
single, lonely life, Cassie.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.626
With all of your friends
on Facebook and Twitter.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:08.997
Because newsflash, they don't
care about you like I do.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.172
I hope you're grabbing
your shit so you can move out,

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.540
because I don't want
you here anymore.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.041
Of course that's what I'm doing.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.743
Do you think I'm
spontaneously cleaning?

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.611
I'm going, and it's not
because you're kicking me out,

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.347
it's because I'm choosing to go.

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.383
Great, because I can't stand
to be around you.

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:31.119
- Great.
- Okay, then.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:32.654
- Okay, then.
- Then just go.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.023
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:36.024
- Go.
- Fine.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:37.325
Go then.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:14.095
In my hand,
i hold one last rose.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:17.699
You know what?
I should be on a reality show.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.768
Like, seriously.

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:23.038
The shit that happens to me,
it's ridiculous.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.607
People would love
watching my life.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.247
What are you saying tonight?

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:33.548
- This.
- Hot.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.352
What's your lover doing?
It's Saturday.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.521
I don't have a lover anymore,
remember?

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:42.123
I have a tumblr girlfriend
that's probably

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.426
a 40-year-old, bald
convenience store worker.

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.395
Ew.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.264
What are you doing tonight?

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.365
The usual.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:51.566
Can I come?

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.736
It's a bunch of us gays,
so... no.

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.504
But I'm gay now.

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:58.773
You're a lesbian, honey.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.642
What's the difference?

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:07.849
Oh, my god.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.253
Oh, you're so cute sometimes.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.356
It's endearing, don't worry.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:21.129
So how did cass end up keeping
the apartment in the divorce?

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:25.100
I gave it to her,
like I gave her my heart.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.569
It's tragic.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.310
Oh, I need to get ready.

01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:39.881
Um, do you want
the rest of my burrito?

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:43.118
What a stupid fucking question.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.385
Of course i want your burrito.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.154
I know, I can always
count on you.

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:47.589
Oh shit.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.564
Christine, you are funny,

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:01.803
smart, cultured, generous.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:05.773
And one of the most interesting
people I've ever met.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.578
But I have to give
my final rose to Brittany

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.913
because she is way too hot.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:17.285
Hey.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.587
What are you up to?

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.390
Do you want to come over?

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:32.200
Hi.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.701
Hey.

01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:06.668
Don't yet, just wait.

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:27.488
Shit. I didn't actually think you
were actually going to be here.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.690
Why?

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:30.291
It's like Friday night
at 11:00.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.660
I assumed you'd be out
drinking or something.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:33.995
It's Saturday night.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:37.498
See, I don't even
know my own life.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.834
Well, we have a tourney
tomorrow, so...

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.270
Right, for soccer.

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:43.972
Yes.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.011
I sent you a bunch of texts.

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:52.914
I never heard back from you.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.349
I got them.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:00.388
Can I just come in?
I really wanna talk to you.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.023
I don't think so.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.559
I have to get up early to leave
for the tournament tomorrow,

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:08.796
and, honestly, i just don't really
want to talk to you right now.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.337
Oh, yeah, no, that's totally
understandable.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:23.011
Can I just say again though
that I'm really sorry?

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:26.581
I'm stupid, okay?
Like, really, really, stupid.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:29.784
Like, should-be-tested stupid.
I think that's pretty evident.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.422
I'm new to all this. I just
didn't know about the whole...

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.758
Tumblr girlfriend thing.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:42.030
No, it's ignorance.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:47.935
Bye, mack.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.078
Fuck.

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.789
Where are you going?

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:11.993
Well, the game show channel
is calling my name, so...

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.497
Cool.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:18.433
I'm down to watch some TV.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:20.668
Oh, um...

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.837
This is awkward.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.775
This was just a Booty call,
okay, so...

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.677
I just wanted some Booty.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.412
What?

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.051
You know, i have a girlfriend.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:41.122
Yeah, and it's obvious
you like her very much.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.424
So, I'm gonna go watch the feud.

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:46.394
But thank you
for fulfilling my needs.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.633
Well, that's tough.

01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:54.502
Laura, on to you.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:57.138
We've surveyed 100 women
and asked what is the worst...

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.507
I am only coming back
because I need more underwear.

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:00.942
Text message.

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:01.943
What was that?

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:03.678
What was what?

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.813
Mack.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:07.548
You guys have a fight
or something?

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.885
She's a self-involved bitch
and a shitty friend.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.020
So she's just like you.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.089
Thought I had more underwear.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:17.171
Apparently I only have
three pairs. Light days it is.

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:22.597
Bye, Matthew.

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:27.402
Yeah, bye.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:30.671
What is the worst way
to dump someone?

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.191
Juliana.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:51.626
It's so nice to see you again.

01:13:51.628 --> 01:13:52.860
Hi, Cassie.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:56.697
It's great to see
you again, too.

01:13:56.699 --> 01:14:00.701
I have some news that I think
you'll be interested in.

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.771
Is it just me or is Elliot being

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.574
completely ridiculous
and over-reacting?

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:42.610
Well, I don't know, I guess.

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:44.946
It's tumblr, like relax.

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:46.747
Maybe you should talk to her.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.016
I already did try talking
to her, I went to her house,

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.052
but she slammed
the door in my face.

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:54.989
She won't return my calls, my texts.
I'm running out of ideas.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:00.695
What if you sent flowers?
Girls love flowers.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:03.698
I think if you like this girl, you
should really try to make it work.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.668
Okay, first, mom, flowers?
That's lame.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.604
Second, whose side are you on?

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.639
Because what it sounds like to
me is that you're on her side.

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:12.974
I'm Switzerland.

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:15.510
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:16.978
You're father's laughing
hysterically right now.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.579
He thought my joke was funny.

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.147
You guys are so weird.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.818
You look skinny.
Are you not eating?

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.254
No, mom, stop being a mom.

01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:26.254
You should be bitching with me.

01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:30.691
Say something mean about
Elliot so I feel better. Go.

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:34.262
When your father and I were
watching "the l word"

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:38.065
and Bette cheated on Tina,
she sent flowers and apologized.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:39.901
So I think that's
what you should do.

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:44.605
Oh, and write a note that says
"you hold all the cards."

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:48.175
For the love of god, stop
watching "the l word" with dad.

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:49.977
Just stop watching it.

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:51.546
I don't know, honey,
maybe you should be talking

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:53.047
to Cassie about all this.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:54.882
We're still fighting.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.651
What about Levi?

01:15:56.653 --> 01:15:59.120
He's too busy
fucking beautiful men.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:01.589
I hope he's using protection.

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:03.925
Well, this conversation
is not helping at all.

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:09.063
Are all girls
this crazy and dramatic?

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.666
Probably.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.572
Where are you and dad
saying tonight?

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:18.839
We're talking to you, honey.

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:21.075
No, saying, like what
are you doing?

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.844
Oh, I need to look up
that slang word.

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:26.080
We are going golfing
with Tracy and Steve.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.348
Gay.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.317
You really shouldn't say that.

01:16:29.319 --> 01:16:31.218
No, no, I'm allowed to say it.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.888
I am gay so it's fine, like,
all black people are allowed

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.990
- to call themselves...
- I don't think so.

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.661
I'm miserable.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:42.830
Oh, honey, your father's
yelling at me. We're late.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.231
Sorry, pumpkin, we have to go.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.900
But I just told you
i was miserable.

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:46.968
We love you.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.675
I hate you.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.110
I'm coming with you.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.112
I belong in New York.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:01.115
Like, look at this face.
This is totally a New York face.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:04.885
Did you know rent for a 300 square
foot apartment is like $1800?

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:11.258
Okay, maybe I have more
of an L.A. face.

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.831
So, I haven't heard from
MacKenzie in a couple days.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.233
I assume she's losing her mind.

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:20.301
From what?

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.671
You moving to New York.

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:26.741
Oh, please.
I didn't even tell her.

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:28.009
You fucking kidding me?

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.410
She didn't tell me she was gay,

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:31.312
so I'm not gonna
tell her I'm moving.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:35.383
Yeah, that's not the same thing
at all, you know that right?

01:17:35.385 --> 01:17:38.152
Well, why don't you
tell her then?

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.756
Okay, I'm just really tired
of being the gbf

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:44.158
that just literally helps
you two with your problems.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.693
I have a life too, you know?

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:48.295
Did you know I can speak
three languages?

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.064
You do not.

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:54.035
Okay, correction, I could
if I learned them.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.771
Put that on your resume.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.806
I mean, what are you guys
even arguing about?

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:00.241
You have three minutes
to tell me,

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:01.308
because I have a date tonight.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.444
What? It's 11:00.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:05.179
Okay, grandma.

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:11.085
MacKenzie is just
so self-involved.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:14.855
It's like she got a girlfriend
and completely forgot I existed.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:17.224
This is coming from the girl
who had no idea

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:19.126
that her best friend was gay.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:23.397
Okay, you know what?
She had a boyfriend.

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:27.435
And, sure, her fashion sense
isn't the greatest,

01:18:27.437 --> 01:18:29.704
but she is color blind

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:34.709
and a lot of girls like hiking
and outdoorsy stuff

01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:39.080
and have posters
of Michelle Rodriguez on...

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.816
Shit.

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:42.817
There we go.

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:44.719
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.387
Mm-hmm.

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.057
Well, whatever.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.159
I'm moving to New York,
and I'm not telling her.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.794
That's that.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:01.001
Okay, look, you're a big girl.
You can do whatever you want.

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:05.773
I'm just the really sexy gay man
who gives exceptional advice,

01:19:05.775 --> 01:19:08.142
so you don't have to listen
to me or anything,

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:10.444
but you're going to regret this.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.949
Just like you'll regret this
outfit you put on tonight.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:17.051
MacKenzie bought me this shirt.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:20.888
You two should be in each other's
lives until one of you dies.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.324
And let's be real, it's most
likely going to be MacKenzie

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:26.193
from choking on some
sort of food.

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:28.329
She needs to learn to stop
talking while she's eating,

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:29.830
it's revolting.

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.801
What if she doesn't want me
in her life anymore?

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.338
I mean, she's gay now.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.941
And I'm straight, so we just
don't have anything in common.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.811
You're being so dramatic.

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:45.479
MacKenzie's always
been gay, babe.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.148
So, guess what?

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:49.183
Nothing's changed.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:52.853
Don't ruin this friendship over,
literally, like, nothing.

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:58.492
You do give really good advice.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:01.262
I know. I think I should have
my own morning talk show.

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:04.532
Oh, my god, I would totally
not watch that.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:09.069
I would never bring you on,
just so you know.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.977
Fuck this fucking site.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.598
Un-fucking-believable.

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.201
What the fuck is this fuckery?

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.946
Oh, fuck.

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:38.425
How did I not know
you were a lesbian?

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.131
Where the fuck are my keys?

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.076
Hey.

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.078
Hey.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.248
Were you seriously going
to leave without telling me?

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.251
No, I was literally on my way,
right now, to tell you.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.520
Oh my god,
we are scarily similar.

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:12.626
New York, huh?

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.330
What are we gonna do?

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:19.066
I guess we'll just have
to have phone sex everyday

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.668
until you can visit me
on weekends?

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:30.711
Look, I wanna give you
this big, apologetic speech

01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:32.613
about what a shitty
friend I was...

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.315
You don't have to.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.319
I think we both said
things that we regret and...

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:43.190
We've both kind of been
shitty friends lately.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.592
I'm sorry.

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.529
I really am.

01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:50.397
I'm sorry, too.

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:58.005
In fact... I actually wrote
a song about it.

01:22:58.007 --> 01:23:00.674
- What?
- Yeah.

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:03.077
I wrote this song when I heard
you were going away,

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:05.245
and I just thought, like,

01:23:05.247 --> 01:23:07.181
"that's like the perfect way
to send her off."

01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:09.450
So I'm just going to sing it
right now, okay?

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:11.051
- Oh.
- Okay.

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:13.120
Here we go,
I'm going to sing it.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.025
What?

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:22.696
Oh, my god.
I'm obviously joking.

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:25.132
I can't even
go through with this.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:28.702
- Okay, I was like "what the hell is
going on right now?" -Jesus Christ.

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:28.702
I was like, "i don't know how"

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:32.506
I'm just going to pretend
to enjoy this shitty song

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.174
"that she prepared for me."

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.743
Okay.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.281
I actually do have something
for you, though.

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.164
Oh, my god.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.635
Is this beach time Ken?

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.372
In the flesh.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.775
Literally in the flesh.

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:10.110
I could not find
his clothes anywhere.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:16.550
You're gonna need something

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:17.818
to remind you of me in New York.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.554
And this naked, plastic man...

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.423
Wait.

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.763
This is for you.

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:35.669
Is this ball gown Barbie?

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:44.244
I'm going to fucking miss you,
you loser.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:17.611
I can't find it anywhere.
Where is it?

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.847
Hmm?
What are you looking for?

01:25:19.849 --> 01:25:23.650
The t-shirt. The god damned
t-shirt, babe.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.519
Um, what does it look like?
I'll help you look.

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:28.288
It's pink and it says
"kindest regards" on it.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:30.624
I don't get it.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:33.160
It's an inside joke
with Cassie, never mind.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:38.432
You're hiding things
from me now?

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:41.535
- You know that Cassie and i are
ex-lovers, right? -Mm-hmm.

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:42.769
- You jealous?
- Yeah.

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:54.248
No, no, honey, we have to be
there in like 20 minutes.

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.284
Yeah, that's not gonna stop me.

01:26:08.697 --> 01:26:10.164
Wait, wait, what time is it?

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:12.299
- What?
- What time is it?

01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:14.234
I don't know, 2:25.

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:15.736
Shit, we're late.

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:18.405
- Yeah.
- Okay, go faster.
