WEBVTT

00:33.366 --> 00:36.286
You go, honey.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.664
One, two...

00:40.790 --> 00:42.792
-
Oh, all right!

00:42.917 --> 00:44.586
We got the lead, Uncle Hank!

00:44.669 --> 00:45.670
We got the lead!

00:45.754 --> 00:47.297


00:47.380 --> 00:49.591
Oh, no. Bobby's on deck.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.468
-

00:51.551 --> 00:52.427
Bobby!

00:52.510 --> 00:54.888

Honey, you forgot your bat!

00:54.971 --> 00:56.806
-

00:56.931 --> 00:58.725
-

01:00.351 --> 01:01.978
-

01:02.604 --> 01:04.564
Bobby! Practice swings!

01:04.647 --> 01:07.067
Stand up and swing the bat!

01:07.442 --> 01:09.235


01:09.319 --> 01:11.112
Well, we could get lucky, Hank.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.323
It's gonna pour any minute now.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200


01:15.283 --> 01:18.870
Okay. It's the bottom of the fifth
so it's an official game.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.706
If it starts to rain
before Bobby's at bat,

01:21.790 --> 01:25.627
they'll end the game and Bobby'll
get a W without embarrassing himself.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.506
-Okay, man.
Dang old batter up, man.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.050


01:32.842 --> 01:34.928
-

01:35.011 --> 01:36.930


01:37.555 --> 01:39.808
Dang it, Bobby! You're right handed!

01:39.891 --> 01:42.143


01:42.894 --> 01:45.063


01:45.730 --> 01:47.607


01:48.233 --> 01:50.318


01:51.361 --> 01:53.196


01:53.988 --> 01:55.990
Talking about that's the dang old game!

01:56.074 --> 01:57.575
Yes! That's it!

01:58.034 --> 01:59.577


01:59.702 --> 02:01.746


02:01.830 --> 02:04.207
Why'd I have to miss my at bat?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.000
I had it all planned out.

02:06.084 --> 02:11.548
After the third strike, I was gonna "walk
like an Egyptian" back to the dugout.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.928
Yup. I'm real sorry I missed that.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.431
What in the heck?

02:21.766 --> 02:23.643
Oh, my God! We've been robbed!

02:23.726 --> 02:25.228
My treasures!

02:25.311 --> 02:27.814
Oh, Ladybird. Thank God you're okay.

02:29.774 --> 02:30.608
Oh, no!

02:30.692 --> 02:33.820
Hank, they took the vase
that your mom made for us!

02:34.779 --> 02:36.823
Oh, no. It's still here.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.324
Oh, but it's broken!

02:39.909 --> 02:40.743
Sure.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.329
When Hank calls the police,
they come right over.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.625
But when I do, they say
it's not their job to keep me company.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.419
I feel violated!

02:49.502 --> 02:53.214
I had over 200 dollars of surveillance
equipment hidden in that house.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.383
I hope it didn't get stolen.

02:55.466 --> 02:59.762
Those burglars must have been
so disappointed when they got inside.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.890
I'm just glad they didn't rob us.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.312
I'm just saying what everyone's thinking.

03:07.395 --> 03:11.524
Well, there's no sign of forced entry,
and from what you're telling us,

03:11.608 --> 03:14.527
nothing is missing,
and something was found.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.031
Yup. I'd been looking
for that remote for days.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.912
Most people think that
it's the person you'd least expect.

03:23.995 --> 03:28.249
But we usually find
it's the person you'd most expect.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.547
Well, I don't know anyone
who would want to do something like this.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.632
Really?

03:35.715 --> 03:41.804
Because the perpetrator usually tends to
be the shadiest looking guy in the room.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.898
In this room, now.

03:59.530 --> 04:03.243
So, Officer, are you gonna find
the perpetrator?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.662
I'm sorry, son. This isn't the movies.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.338
Where am I supposed to hide my valuables?

04:15.421 --> 04:18.424
See? This is why we need
a spinning bookcase.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.468
Peggy, I know this was upsetting.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.471
But I think Ladybird's all the security
we need.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.599
Hank, Ladybird let the guy
ransack the place.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.394
If I were her, I would have given him
one warning bark

04:29.477 --> 04:31.813
and then bit him right in the windpipe.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.235
What the heck are you guys doing here?

04:37.318 --> 04:39.946
We're too scared to sleep at our house,
Uncle Hank.

04:40.029 --> 04:45.368
I just want to live in a world where Santa
can get in your house but thieves cannot!

04:45.451 --> 04:49.122
The cat burglar inside me
can appreciate a job well done.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.417
But the fraidy cat inside me
says run like hell.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.627
See, I got two cats inside me.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.632
Okay, fine. You can both sleep in the den.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.883
Sleep!

05:10.351 --> 05:12.353
Hank, someone's in the house.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.481
Wait. I'm coming too.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.442
A butcher's knife?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.444
All right.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.533
Uncle Hank, I'm scared.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.327
I got the gun safe!

05:29.203 --> 05:30.663
Ladybird's got him!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.499
Ladybird!

05:33.583 --> 05:34.459
Ladybird?

05:35.793 --> 05:37.837
There had better be a criminal
in that cushion.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.047
Wow.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.965
She hates that couch.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.931
I can't believe it was Ladybird
who messed up the house all along.

05:49.015 --> 05:54.520
I guess after 10 years of not being
allowed on the couch, she finally snapped!

05:55.605 --> 05:59.233
I don't understand what would make
Ladybird do something like this.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.528
Poor thing.
I need to spend more time with her.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.741
Maybe I've been so caught up with work,
I've forgotten what really matters.

06:06.824 --> 06:11.162
Hank, all I know is if you had come in
to find me chewing up the couch,

06:11.245 --> 06:13.373
you would not be nearly so forgiving.

06:17.001 --> 06:21.798
You sniff that poop, Ladybird.
Sniff to your heart's content.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.758
Gotta take care of some business, huh?

06:23.841 --> 06:25.426
Well, knock yourself out.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.100
It's okay, Ladybird.
Just a little thunder.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.060
Aw!

06:34.143 --> 06:35.311
Ladybird!

06:38.106 --> 06:41.526
Yeah, my dog's never done
anything like this before.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.445
Maybe it's got something to do
with all the thunderstorms.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.572
Maybe. Dogs are very unpredictable.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.366
You never know what they're going to do.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.159
Now, what's the name of your dog?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.870
Ladybird. Ladybird Hill.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.288
Why does that matter?

06:54.372 --> 06:57.375
Oh, I'm required by law to report Ladybird
to the authorities.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.419
They'll be putting her
on the "vicious dog" list.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.046
The vicious dog list? But that's a...

07:02.130 --> 07:04.132
It's a list of vicious dogs.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.466
It's just a formality.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.262
Unless Ladybird were to bite anyone else,
then the state can take her away.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.430
Take her away?

07:10.513 --> 07:13.516
Oh. I'm sorry about the euphemism.
I'm not a veterinarian.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.518
I'm used to talking about people.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.311
Of course, I mean kill her.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.855
Kill her?

07:18.938 --> 07:20.231
Hm.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.859
I don't know how to be any clearer
than that, Mister Hill.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.703
And then he put Ladybird
on the vicious dog list.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.745
Ladybird!

07:34.829 --> 07:37.957
Hank, I too am on more lists
than I'd care to be.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.669
Lists at the CIA, the FBI, L.L. Bean.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.172
Ladybird's such a nice dog too.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.717
She's always licking my face,
even when all the crumbs are gone.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.220
She's a great dog!
And does she look vicious to you?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.306
Huh? Huh?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.640
This is ridiculous.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.561
There is no goddang way
I am letting her stay on that list.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.024
You know, if Ladybird does bite again,
you can just blame Peggy.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.902
They'd haul her away,
then we'd all be rid of her!

08:08.321 --> 08:10.072
-<i>Well, I wish
I could help you, Hank.</i>

08:10.156 --> 08:13.075
But once a dog gets put
on the vicious dog list,

08:13.159 --> 08:15.119
well, it's dang near impossible
to get them off.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.039
But Ladybird shouldn't be on that list.
You know her.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.582
You know she's not vicious.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.502
But she's old now.
Her faculties are failing.

08:22.585 --> 08:26.672
You don't know what's gonna set her off.
It could be thunder, or other loud noises.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.217
And there's no telling what she could do.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.220
Now, although you can't reverse
the aging process,

08:32.303 --> 08:34.680
you can try to change a dog's behavior.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.766
You've heard of the dog whisperer, right?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.351
Yes.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.894
Well, here's the number of a guy

08:39.977 --> 08:41.896
people call when they
can't get on his show.

08:43.981 --> 08:47.485
Are you telling me
to go to a dog spiritualist?

08:47.568 --> 08:51.322
Look, Hank, I don't claim to know
what mysteries the universe holds,

08:51.405 --> 08:52.532
but this guy does.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.537
You know, I think
he may be your last hope.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.916
Oh, God.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.680
Sorry. I'm late. I'm just very important.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.100
So you are Ladybird's human.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.937
You are like that dog whisperer on the TV.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.814
The dog whisperer?

09:24.897 --> 09:27.608
Please. That talentless showoff.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.193
Okay. Well...

09:29.277 --> 09:32.530
Ladybird here's got a problem
with thunder and loud noises.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.825
If we don't fix it, Animal Control is
gonna take her away.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.745
Otherwise, I would never agree
to talk to a person such as yourself.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.416
I see. So during these thunderstorms,
does she bark like...

09:45.209 --> 09:46.377
...or more like a...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.339
I'm gonna stand up and leave now.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.843
Mister Hill, do you want
to save your dog or not?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.686
Okay. We'll do whatever it takes.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.645
Good.

10:04.729 --> 10:09.650
Now, Ladybird, I need to visit you
in your natural environment.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.193
And this is why...

10:16.282 --> 10:18.618
Now walk your dog.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.121
No, no, no, no, no!

10:23.414 --> 10:24.832
You must be the leader.

10:24.915 --> 10:28.002
Some hacks refer to this
as being the alpha dog.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.047
I call it being the pack leader dog.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.173
Much fresher.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.591
Much fresher!

10:36.344 --> 10:38.054
Posture, posture.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.097
Walk as though you have
an invisible top hat.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.017
-You want me to what now?
-Top hat!

10:51.692 --> 10:54.737
Now, I've never seen Hank pretend before.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.863
I don't like it.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.282
Hey, Hank, if you're gonna wear
an invisible top hat,

10:58.366 --> 11:00.993
I'd carry an invisible bat for protection.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.330
Would you guys shut up?
I'm trying to save my dog.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.291
Who's a good boy
listening to his trainer like that?

11:07.375 --> 11:11.587
Is it you, Hank? Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.300
She does not have respect for you.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.096
Try carrying an invisible walking stick.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.440
You know, all Hank needs is an invisible
monocle and he'd look like Mister Peanut.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.445
<i>I've got nothing
against good posture.</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:39.365
But what's that got to do
with making Ladybird better?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.575
I feel so stupid.

11:41.659 --> 11:46.163
Oh, Hank, so you love Ladybird and
you're willing to do anything to keep her.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.748
Does that make you stupid?

11:47.832 --> 11:48.916
No.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.920
Yes, it does. But it's okay.
Love makes people stupid.

11:53.003 --> 11:57.383
And I cannot help but be moved
by how stupid you are being right now.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.597
Okay, Hank. Tell Ladybird to sit.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.307
Ladybird, sit.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.271
Sorry. I have bacon in my pocket.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.358
Try again.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.611
Ladybird, sit.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.490
This isn't working!

12:21.574 --> 12:24.160
I have blamed the owner,
humiliated the owner...

12:24.243 --> 12:26.704
I must free-brain this conundrum.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.499
She's searching...

12:30.583 --> 12:32.752
She's on a path of self-discovery!

12:32.835 --> 12:34.628
Ah. Of course I see!

12:34.712 --> 12:38.340
Ladybird is a pack animal
in search of her pack!

12:38.424 --> 12:40.718
You must take her to her own kind!

12:40.801 --> 12:43.637
Are you sure she's not just looking
at some throwup?

12:43.721 --> 12:44.972
To the pack!

12:50.519 --> 12:51.979
This is the pack?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.564
They're a bunch of old people.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.525
I will explain to you
as I explain to everybody.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.194
Hello!

12:58.277 --> 13:00.404
This is Ladybird.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.283
I believe you will benefit
from each other's company.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.953
You beautiful creatures have
so much in common.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.957
She is old. You are old.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.128
She'll die soon. You'll die soon.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.381
It's perfect really.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.262
Oh, what a nice doggy.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.765
See?

13:28.933 --> 13:32.645
I hope this is gonna be okay.
I don't feel right about this.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.191
Look how happy she looks.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.069
So, what are you in for?

13:40.152 --> 13:43.656
Well, I'm old.
I only have a few months to live.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.199
That's great!

13:45.282 --> 13:47.368
I'm having a baby in a few months.

13:47.451 --> 13:50.704
And Lucky and I have been talking a lot
about reincarnation.

13:50.788 --> 13:55.334
Maybe when you die,
you can come back as my baby!

13:56.210 --> 13:57.503
Okay.

14:00.422 --> 14:06.053
Dad, if Ladybird likes hard candy and
Wild Turkey, I've got the room for her.

14:06.136 --> 14:10.224
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go for a walk around the building.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.476
Wow.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.521
Maybe this nut job
actually knows what he's doing.

14:15.604 --> 14:19.358
Yeah. Maybe this nut job
actually knows what he's doing.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.110
Is this such a good idea?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.612
What if Ladybird bites somebody?

14:23.696 --> 14:27.074
Old people are always dying
over the stupidest little things.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.910
Hm. That's why we want to keep
this initial visit brief.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.581
If we overwhelm the dog, she might snap
like she's never snapped before.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.832
Huh! Uh...

14:34.915 --> 14:38.586
You know, that might have been something
to mention before we came in here.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.338
Boy, are my knees achy.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.507
Not as bad as my joints.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.342
Must be rain coming.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.220
-Rain?
-It feels like it'll be a doozy too.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.973
It's a hard rain gonna fall.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.893
Remember Bob Dylan? Jewish fellow.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.689
<i>And the lion and the chimp</i>
<i>are still best friends.</i>

14:58.772 --> 15:00.274
<i>Now, here's Kirk with the weather.</i>

15:00.357 --> 15:02.943
<i>Hey, Kirk, am I taking an umbrella</i>
<i>to the big game?</i>

15:03.027 --> 15:05.279
<i>It's at Dome Stadium.</i>
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

15:06.363 --> 15:07.656
Oh, come on.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.703
<i>Ah. But seriously. If you have
to go outside, take my advice, don't.</i>

15:12.786 --> 15:16.206
<i>Because there's gonna be some</i>
<i>major thunderstorm activity here,</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:19.668
<i>here, here, and here.</i>

15:19.752 --> 15:22.379
-No!
<i>-Heck, if you can see this,</i>

15:22.463 --> 15:26.133
<i>you might as well stay inside because,</i>
<i>folks, it's gonna be a big one.</i>

15:26.216 --> 15:27.468
Oh, God.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.805
Was it thunderstorms or gunfire
that sent Ladybird into such a frenzy?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.349
Thunderstorms!

15:36.101 --> 15:39.063
Where's my dog? Where's Ladybird?

15:39.146 --> 15:42.316
Is that what used to be
on the end of this?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.457
Peggy, we've got a real problem.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.543
It's thundering outside,
and Ladybird's on the loose!

16:01.627 --> 16:05.506
Oh, my goodness! Okay. Everybody, be calm!

16:05.589 --> 16:06.590
We are calm.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.718
Well, you shouldn't be!
There's a vicious dog on the loose!

16:09.802 --> 16:10.886
Peggy!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.638
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

16:12.721 --> 16:17.977
Now, when you're born and the doctor
slaps you, I want you to cry like this.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.398
And that way I'll know it's you.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.650
Okay.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.902
Mom, Dad, what's going on?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.946
Come on. We need to find Ladybird.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.157
It's okay, everyone.
I called Animal Control.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.242
Help is on the way.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.827
No! They'll kill her!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.831
Ep-ep! You stay right here.

16:38.914 --> 16:43.043
The alpha, I mean, pack leader
doesn't seek out his followers.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.920
His followers come to him.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.340
I'm done listening to you
and your psychobabble crap!

16:48.424 --> 16:52.594
Now, get out of my way or my pack leader
foot is gonna kick your ass!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.348
Woo-hoo

16:56.432 --> 16:58.058
-Ladybird!
-Here, Ladybird!

16:58.142 --> 16:59.268
Come on, girl!

17:13.782 --> 17:15.325
Dang it! We've got to hurry!

17:17.828 --> 17:20.414
Well, who do we have here?

17:20.497 --> 17:22.916
Aren't you the cutest thing?

17:23.625 --> 17:28.047
Mom, Dad, there's no time!
Don't look back! Just go!

17:30.049 --> 17:31.884
Want to play with my teeth?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.680
I've changed my mind! Come back!

17:36.764 --> 17:38.223
At first, he was a...

17:39.433 --> 17:41.977
...but when I was through working
with him, he was a...

17:44.229 --> 17:47.983
You know, you remind me
of a German Shepherd I used to have.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.110
Would you mind if I petted you?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.236
Eh...

17:51.987 --> 17:53.030
Go ahead.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.285
-Ladybird!
-Ladybird!

18:38.700 --> 18:40.536
I saw the dog! She went in there!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.166
Ladybird, stop!

18:47.835 --> 18:49.169
Ladybird!

18:56.468 --> 18:57.678
Good girl.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.429
Move! Move! Move!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.766
I've got a clear shot at her!

19:02.850 --> 19:05.561
You sure?
Because I'm pretty good with this thing.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.770
No, stop!

19:06.854 --> 19:09.064
Does this look like a vicious dog to you?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.734
I don't know. Maybe.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.237
Aren't you sweet?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.367
No.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.078
This dog wouldn't harm anyone.
Look at her.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.999
I'm still pretty amped up.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.209
You want to go somewhere
and talk about this?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.006
Come on, Ladybird. Let's go.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.429
Come on, girl.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.102
Dang it. Ladybird, don't make me walk
with the top hat.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.621
Oh, my God. You're deaf.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.375
I thought she might be faking.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.212
Now, I need to ask you a favor.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.756
Could you please have my eyes?

20:15.839 --> 20:18.675
Lucky's don't always line up
exactly right.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.761
Everybody, I have great news.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.764
Loud noises
will never upset Ladybird again.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.349
She's gone deaf.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.937
See, Hank?
I told you I could save that dog.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.523
How in the heck are you gonna take credit
for my dog going deaf?

20:34.524 --> 20:37.069
Probably with an exclusive
in "Dog Fancy" magazine.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.031
Come on. Let's go home.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.325
Wait. Where's Bobby?

20:43.408 --> 20:50.123
Your daughter does sound nice, Doris.
But 57 might be a little old for me.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.586
You know, it's kind of sad.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.506
Ladybird used to love watching football
with me.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.591
Now she can't even hear the announcers.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.678
Well, we could put on
the closed captioning for her.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.514
She's a dog, Bill. She can't read.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.686
Hey, change the channel.
She hates this commercial.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.647
<i>And that brings
up fourth and long.</i>

21:13.730 --> 21:15.274
<i>Punting unit's coming out.</i>

21:52.811 --> 21:55.397
-<i>Maybe this nut job
actually knows what he's doing.</i>
