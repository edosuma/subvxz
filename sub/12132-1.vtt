WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:14.161
Look alive!

00:14.328 --> 00:16.538
Damn it!
Goddamn it!

00:16.705 --> 00:19.041
You call that blocking,
you pussy-pukes?

00:19.167 --> 00:21.252
You gotta pick up
the linebacker!

00:21.419 --> 00:25.046
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field,
you limp-ass blowdicks!

00:25.213 --> 00:29.759
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!

00:32.807 --> 00:34.933
You gonna rejoin
the living tomorrow, Stan?

00:35.058 --> 00:37.435
You've got to feel the pressure
closing in on you!

00:37.602 --> 00:39.604
Then you get rid of the rock!

00:39.770 --> 00:43.107
Now get focused
or get the fuck off my team!

00:47.112 --> 00:49.156
- Shit!
- Let it go.

01:22.270 --> 01:26.940
This better be important or somebody's
gonna be doing laps until sunrise.

01:31.610 --> 01:34.279
Yeah? What?

01:38.662 --> 01:42.623
Please let me finish this
so we can go home. It's late.

01:44.124 --> 01:47.627
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness,
no new computers.

01:47.795 --> 01:48.829
But–

01:48.835 --> 01:51.966
Get the service guy down here
and get the old ones juiced.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.301
Mr Tate,
you're dreaming.

01:54.468 --> 01:57.303
Absolutely no field trips
to New York City.

01:57.470 --> 01:59.306
I don't think
that you understand.

01:59.473 --> 02:02.392
You're not getting out
of Ohio. Rethink it.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.229
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.

02:06.396 --> 02:09.398
There's just no money
for a musical this year.

02:09.565 --> 02:14.652
But I bet the football team gets their
new jerseys and their new equipment.

02:16.405 --> 02:19.741
Have you seen the football stadium
on a Friday night, Mr Tate?

02:19.908 --> 02:23.703
The entire town is there. This is
a football town, let me remind you,

02:23.870 --> 02:27.081
and, yes, the team will get
new jerseys and new knee pads...

02:27.249 --> 02:30.418
and new jock straps and anything else
they want in the name of education...

02:30.585 --> 02:33.253
because that is what
the school board wants.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.422
Because that is what
the parents in this town want.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.427
I'm sorry.

02:38.596 --> 02:40.764
My frustrated hands are tied.

02:46.436 --> 02:50.439
I don't see why we can't have
a few new computers...

02:50.606 --> 02:53.109
so the children will learn
a little set up.

02:53.276 --> 02:58.072
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their
heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.

02:58.239 --> 03:03.368
Well... maybe if they use
last year's set from Our Town.

03:03.536 --> 03:06.204
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.

03:06.371 --> 03:08.331
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.

03:55.587 --> 03:59.465
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?

03:59.632 --> 04:03.968
You look...
very, very pretty tonight,

04:04.135 --> 04:06.470
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?

04:06.637 --> 04:10.724
I'm sorry to bother you,
but...

04:12.434 --> 04:16.187
I can't seem to find a pencil.

04:16.353 --> 04:19.523
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.776
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.

04:22.944 --> 04:24.820
Do you have a pencil?

04:24.988 --> 04:29.450
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.

04:29.617 --> 04:34.038
Look, why don't you and your pencil
go home. It's late.

04:36.041 --> 04:40.672
You look...
very, very pretty tonight.

04:40.839 --> 04:44.467
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?

04:51.557 --> 04:54.392
I've always wanted to do that.

05:11.701 --> 05:13.994
Would Miss Drake please report...

05:14.161 --> 05:15.913
to the principal's office?

05:46.693 --> 05:50.363
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door! Coach Willis attacked me!

05:50.531 --> 05:53.409
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.

05:53.575 --> 05:56.411
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!

05:56.578 --> 05:58.956
- Where are your keys?
- Wait–

06:01.708 --> 06:03.584
In the office.

06:03.752 --> 06:05.629
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.

06:05.795 --> 06:09.715
- Please, let me get help.
- No, just talk to me, okay?

06:09.882 --> 06:12.551
Miss Drake...

06:12.718 --> 06:14.677
please be careful.

06:27.147 --> 06:29.733
He's insane.

06:36.539 --> 06:39.450
Miss Drake, he's coming!

06:39.617 --> 06:41.660
Hurry! Hurry!

06:48.420 --> 06:50.755
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!

06:53.090 --> 06:54.375
Hurry!

06:58.095 --> 07:00.014
- Shit!
- No!

07:01.974 --> 07:03.850
Hurry!

07:09.107 --> 07:11.233
Help me!

07:20.116 --> 07:22.201
Prick.

07:36.048 --> 07:38.049
I always wanted to do that.

08:35.857 --> 08:38.693
You fucking bitch!

08:38.859 --> 08:41.070
What the hell
were you doing?

08:47.241 --> 08:50.121
Whatever.
All right?

08:54.876 --> 08:57.211
Sorry. My fault.

08:57.378 --> 08:59.255
Crash and burn, Casey.

09:02.967 --> 09:06.221
Get out of the fucking car,
you stupid bitch!

09:06.387 --> 09:08.806
Goddamn you!

09:09.973 --> 09:12.684
- You okay?
- Walk much?

09:12.851 --> 09:15.019
You ran into me, beast.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.398
Okay, now listen up.
Since we're all wearing the same uniforms,

09:18.565 --> 09:20.399
let's keep
the hair the same.

09:20.566 --> 09:22.818
No hair spray, no teasing,
just elegant.

09:24.278 --> 09:26.112
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.

09:26.279 --> 09:29.698
Stan, watch it. Those are Estee Lauder lips.
Takes 72 minutes to apply.

09:29.825 --> 09:31.701
Sorry.

09:31.868 --> 09:34.203
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.539
I need a new headline
for the school paper. It's important.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.542
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.

09:39.709 --> 09:44.256
In fact... it could be just the story
you're looking for.

09:44.422 --> 09:46.341
Do the words "editor-in-chief"
mean anything to you?

09:46.507 --> 09:48.426
Leave the news
to me, okay?

09:48.592 --> 09:51.014
Later.

09:51.481 --> 09:53.266
That chick weakens legs, meat.

09:56.144 --> 09:58.729
- One, two, three–
- No, not the pole!

09:58.896 --> 10:01.357
Yeah, do it again!

10:01.523 --> 10:04.526
Yeah!

10:08.156 --> 10:09.949
Excuse me.

10:10.116 --> 10:13.910
Could you please tell me where
the office is? It's my first day here.

10:16.621 --> 10:20.332
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.586
I really love what you've done with your nose ring.
It brings out the colour in your eyes.

10:31.718 --> 10:35.638
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!

10:35.763 --> 10:38.808
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

10:46.273 --> 10:48.150
Dude, that's not me.

10:48.275 --> 10:50.401
Doesn't even look like me.

10:50.568 --> 10:51.822
It's fifty bucks,
right?

10:51.989 --> 10:56.284
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.

10:56.452 --> 10:59.956
I don't know, man. How do we know
these things are even gonna work?

11:00.123 --> 11:02.750
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.

11:04.042 --> 11:06.127
Then why are you repeating
your senior year?

11:06.294 --> 11:08.172
All right, look, man.

11:08.338 --> 11:10.548
I'll throw in
a couple hits of this.

11:10.716 --> 11:16.554
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.

11:22.018 --> 11:25.187
Up the nose, right?

11:25.354 --> 11:27.731
Whatever works, man.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.237
Fuck.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.868
Excuse me, Mr Tate.

11:45.705 --> 11:51.043
Try to remember, Harry,
the projector's got teeth.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.757
Sharp ones.

11:53.924 --> 11:56.384
We should be getting hazard pay
for this sort of faulty equipment.

11:56.551 --> 11:59.762
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.

11:59.930 --> 12:03.183
I–
I called you this weekend.

12:03.349 --> 12:06.018
I got your machine.
How's your cold?

12:06.185 --> 12:10.356
- I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?

12:11.123 --> 12:13.900
A bit tired, but no complaints.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.111
I got it.

12:18.364 --> 12:21.367
Can we say,
"retirement"?

12:24.468 --> 12:26.371
Maybe you should just go home.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.373
No, thank you.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.709
I'm saving my sick days
for when I feel better.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.715
Maybe I should just put
a pen in my eye.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.599
When will that bitch turn
the air conditioning back on?

12:47.766 --> 12:50.434
Hey, speaking of which,
has anybody seen Principal Drake?

12:50.560 --> 12:53.813
Maybe she had
a sunstroke and died.

12:58.988 --> 13:01.573
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.

13:01.740 --> 13:06.077
Probably a pregame ritual.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.913
Just looking at him
makes me want to take a piss.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.087
Good morning, Mrs Olson.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.175
You look
very, very pretty today.

13:35.021 --> 13:39.025
So...
what was Crusoe's...

13:39.233 --> 13:41.026
greatest fear?

13:44.197 --> 13:46.533
Anyone?

13:50.369 --> 13:52.204
Yes, Zeke.

13:52.370 --> 13:56.374
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be
stuck on that island forever...

13:56.541 --> 13:58.379
with nothing but calluses.

13:59.146 --> 14:00.881
No, that's not correct.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.551
Isolation
was his greatest fear.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.844
Yes, but...

14:07.011 --> 14:09.346
his external existence
in no way compared...

14:09.514 --> 14:13.602
to the internal agony
of the loneliness he felt.

14:15.645 --> 14:17.521
That's very good.

14:17.688 --> 14:20.191
Like I said, calluses.

14:21.859 --> 14:25.362
So Cathy tells me one thing,
and then Liz says another...

14:25.529 --> 14:27.364
and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story,

14:27.530 --> 14:29.532
so which one
do you want me to print?

14:29.699 --> 14:31.534
Print them all.
He's a jerk.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.869
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.

14:34.037 --> 14:35.871
Could we back-burner it?

14:36.038 --> 14:38.874
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?

14:39.040 --> 14:41.876
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?

14:42.043 --> 14:46.256
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.

14:46.423 --> 14:47.917
What brought this on?

14:49.384 --> 14:52.679
Well, I've been weighing
the importance of being a jock...

14:52.846 --> 14:56.182
- with my impending future, and I decided–
- You just decided?

14:56.349 --> 14:59.351
Stan, what about college? The football
scholarship is your only shot.

14:59.522 --> 15:01.982
If I quit now, I can work
harder at studying,

15:02.149 --> 15:04.484
maybe raise
my grades a little.

15:04.651 --> 15:08.362
I'd rather go to college...
based on my intellect.

15:08.529 --> 15:10.447
You're not good
at studying.

15:10.614 --> 15:12.407
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.

15:12.575 --> 15:17.205
Yeah, I've always been good at football
and basketball and every other sport I try.

15:17.372 --> 15:21.041
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.

15:21.208 --> 15:24.044
And what am I supposed to do while you're
on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?

15:24.211 --> 15:27.339
- What?
- The accepted social order...

15:27.506 --> 15:31.259
is head cheerleaders date star
quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.

15:31.425 --> 15:33.594
Don't be superficial.

15:33.761 --> 15:36.513
"Superficial."
Four syllables.

15:36.681 --> 15:38.891
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.

15:39.057 --> 15:41.017
Let me know how
the cancer cure goes.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.523
I was hoping you'd be
with me on this.

15:58.825 --> 16:03.915
Now, if everyone will turn
to chapter four:

16:04.083 --> 16:06.752
"The Nation of the State."

16:06.919 --> 16:10.089
"Only through conformity
among the masses...

16:10.256 --> 16:16.094
can the unified state offer the benefits
of power order and security."

16:16.262 --> 16:20.266
Actually, we covered that
last week, Mr Tate.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.559
We're on chapter five.

16:22.726 --> 16:25.103
Whatever.

16:25.270 --> 16:29.940
Now if you could all please
join Stan on chapter five:

16:30.108 --> 16:32.985
"Individual Action in Society."

16:48.416 --> 16:50.251
What are you reading?

16:51.460 --> 16:53.212
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.840
You one of those
science fiction people?

16:56.006 --> 17:00.927
Y'all believe in alternate universes
and alien beings and stuff?

17:02.261 --> 17:04.558
I'm feeling pretty alien
myself today.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.602
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta. I'm new here.

17:07.770 --> 17:10.605
- No shit.
- What's your name?

17:10.771 --> 17:12.357
Why do you want
to know my name?

17:12.523 --> 17:15.984
'Cause I don't have
any friends.

17:16.151 --> 17:19.446
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem
to have one less than that.

17:19.615 --> 17:23.742
- So I just thought–
- Stokely, are you seducing the new students again?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.743
Hi. I'm Delilah.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.997
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.

17:28.164 --> 17:32.125
Don't you love the way Stokely accessorizes
different shades of black in her ensemble?

17:32.293 --> 17:34.462
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist...

17:34.628 --> 17:36.839
on being such a bad example
for your people.

17:37.005 --> 17:40.008
- What people?
- I hope you're not a violent lesbian like your new friend.

17:41.175 --> 17:42.134
No.

17:42.301 --> 17:44.887
I'm not aware of any lesbianism
in my lineage.

17:45.054 --> 17:47.890
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just
have to keep looking for Miss Right.

17:48.057 --> 17:50.852
Bipolar bitch.

17:51.018 --> 17:52.853
Violent.

17:53.020 --> 17:54.855
Yeah.

18:40.817 --> 18:45.989
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.

18:46.156 --> 18:49.158
This ain't the cafeteria, son.

18:49.326 --> 18:52.496
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.

18:52.663 --> 18:55.623
You're–

18:55.790 --> 18:59.460
- I forget your name.
- Casey.

18:59.585 --> 19:03.671
Right.
I've seen you around.

19:03.839 --> 19:05.757
You're not really
into sports.

19:05.924 --> 19:09.764
I don't think a person should run
unless he's being chased.

19:11.015 --> 19:13.016
"Being chased."

19:13.141 --> 19:15.185
I like that.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.316
Get outta here.

19:42.585 --> 19:46.755
- Mrs Brummel, may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.

19:56.265 --> 19:59.100
Man, get a fucking eye dog.

19:59.267 --> 20:02.938
Maybe if you didn't paint
your fucking eyes shut.

20:08.401 --> 20:10.948
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.

20:11.115 --> 20:12.950
Found something
on the football field.

20:13.075 --> 20:14.951
Thought you might want
to take a look.

20:15.118 --> 20:17.078
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

20:17.246 --> 20:19.081
Want to be
lab partners?

20:22.291 --> 20:25.170
I didn't know
you were a lesbian.

20:25.337 --> 20:28.005
I don't think
I've ever met one before.

20:28.172 --> 20:30.799
Have you been out long?

20:30.967 --> 20:33.803
I think it's very impressive
and evolved of you–

20:33.928 --> 20:36.430
I'm not a lesbian,
all right?

20:36.555 --> 20:40.475
Be one. Please.
Fly free.

20:40.641 --> 20:44.811
You were right about me. I don't have
any friends, and I like it that way.

20:44.979 --> 20:48.774
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?

20:48.941 --> 20:50.692
People like you.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.572
Complex.

20:56.699 --> 20:58.534
Certain mesozoan...

20:58.700 --> 21:02.412
only exist in the kidney
of certain squid and octopi.

21:04.705 --> 21:08.917
- Which doesn't make sense because–
- This is Ohio.

21:09.085 --> 21:11.673
Right.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.634
It's a pelagic organism.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.511
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.555
Exactly.

21:20.973 --> 21:25.518
But I don't recognize
this surface tissue at all.

21:25.686 --> 21:28.731
Casey, I don't want to blow smoke up your butt,
but I think you found a new species.

21:28.898 --> 21:30.357
Yeah, right.

21:30.483 --> 21:34.194
It could happen. New species
are discovered every day.

21:34.362 --> 21:36.613
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?

21:36.738 --> 21:40.408
- No.
- They escaped detection till the mid-20th century.

21:40.575 --> 21:42.326
You just know
everything.

21:43.494 --> 21:45.662
I'm a contradiction.

21:45.829 --> 21:47.872
Check the mesodermic follicles
on its underbelly.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.876
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university,

21:52.043 --> 21:55.713
let them take a look, maybe get in
on some of that federal grant money.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.549
Our secret...
all right?

22:00.218 --> 22:02.929
- Hey, Stokely, maybe it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.

22:05.181 --> 22:07.933
Did you see that?

22:09.226 --> 22:11.936
What is it doing?

22:17.403 --> 22:21.072
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.

22:21.239 --> 22:23.074
Yeah, but couldn't this kill it?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.075
Yeah, you don't want
to drown it.

22:25.243 --> 22:28.121
- One way to find out.
- Man.

22:34.042 --> 22:35.753
It's all right.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.964
It's okay.

22:46.430 --> 22:49.099
Mr Furlong,
what are you doing?

22:49.265 --> 22:51.100
I'm just gonna check
his prostate.

22:51.268 --> 22:53.103
Actually,
the surface texture changed,

22:53.270 --> 22:56.480
so... I want to feel it.

23:08.659 --> 23:12.203
It can replicate.
Jesus.

23:14.584 --> 23:16.752
Fuck!

23:16.920 --> 23:19.172
Goddamn it!

23:22.591 --> 23:25.802
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.347
Where did it get teeth?

23:29.515 --> 23:32.268
I'm gonna call the university.

23:44.612 --> 23:47.781
I've just been thinking
ahead, Coach,

23:47.948 --> 23:50.283
and...

23:50.450 --> 23:53.787
I've decided
to quit the team...

23:53.954 --> 23:57.623
and concentrate
on my academics.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.045
Okay.

24:01.211 --> 24:03.922
Stan, we'll miss you.

24:04.089 --> 24:06.215
That's it?

24:06.382 --> 24:08.467
Well, what do you
want me to say?

24:08.635 --> 24:11.971
My star quarterback comes to me the day
before we play Brun County,

24:12.138 --> 24:14.807
the only team in the district
that can kick our ass,

24:14.973 --> 24:17.979
and tells me
he doesn't want to play.

24:18.146 --> 24:20.314
There's something up with that.

24:20.482 --> 24:23.984
You seem to be going through
some life-defining turning point,

24:24.151 --> 24:27.696
and I'm not gonna stand in the way
of the human condition.

24:29.614 --> 24:31.616
You do what you have to do.

24:31.782 --> 24:34.494
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.

24:34.662 --> 24:38.039
What kind of human being
would I be if I did that?

24:51.343 --> 24:53.219
Hey, give me that back.

24:56.013 --> 24:59.015
Hey, yo, piss wad,
you're in my way.

24:59.183 --> 25:01.018
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.

25:04.146 --> 25:06.523
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.

25:06.690 --> 25:08.775
Hey.

25:08.942 --> 25:13.321
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?

25:13.489 --> 25:16.158
That's right.
We'll kill them!

25:16.325 --> 25:18.413
We draw blood! Yeah!

25:22.916 --> 25:26.711
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.

26:09.876 --> 26:11.711
Yo, Casey, is that you?

26:19.635 --> 26:22.056
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck–
- Please.

26:22.223 --> 26:25.351
Help me.
I can't breathe.

26:26.435 --> 26:28.354
Get help!

26:30.815 --> 26:35.694
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.

26:37.488 --> 26:38.698
It's okay.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.254
Is Mrs Brummel
gonna be okay?

26:55.421 --> 26:59.383
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been
diagnosed with cancer,

26:59.550 --> 27:02.469
and she's on a lot
of medication at the moment.

27:02.635 --> 27:05.471
It causes
disorientation.

27:05.639 --> 27:10.477
We were hoping that she would get through
the school year, but unfortunately it–

27:10.644 --> 27:13.980
I hope you can understand
the sensitive nature of the situation.

27:14.146 --> 27:16.315
Yeah.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.108
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.

27:20.944 --> 27:24.534
Casey? You understand?

27:24.700 --> 27:27.077
Casey, you understand?

27:30.163 --> 27:32.874
- Casey?
- Yeah.

27:34.501 --> 27:36.336
Sure.

27:44.010 --> 27:47.014
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?

27:47.181 --> 27:49.516
Yep.
Party of prettiness.

27:49.683 --> 27:52.226
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.

28:02.485 --> 28:07.323
Zeke, you cannot conduct
personal business on school property.

28:07.489 --> 28:10.743
Well, Miss Burke,
we have a problem...

28:10.911 --> 28:13.496
because I'm sitting on my car
and that's my property.

28:13.663 --> 28:17.666
Well, I've had complaints
from several students...

28:17.833 --> 28:20.168
that you've sold them
mind-altering substances.

28:20.335 --> 28:22.754
You want to tell me about it
or take it up with Principal Drake?

28:22.921 --> 28:27.179
You're too tense, Miss Burke,
but I've got just the thing for you.

28:27.345 --> 28:29.722
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure
here. It's time you realized that.

28:29.889 --> 28:32.433
"For gentle relief of blockage
caused by dietary stress."

28:32.600 --> 28:35.185
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know...

28:35.353 --> 28:37.188
if you applied
just five percent...

28:37.354 --> 28:40.441
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover?

28:40.608 --> 28:43.027
you could have made up
your finals last summer.

28:43.193 --> 28:46.905
- You didn't have to repeat your senior year.
- How about these?

28:47.071 --> 28:48.739
Condoms.

28:48.907 --> 28:52.660
Magnum-sized,
and they're cherry-flavoured.

28:54.787 --> 28:57.456
Come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.

28:58.582 --> 29:01.167
That's so rude.

29:10.761 --> 29:13.638
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.

29:13.806 --> 29:18.643
Well, we found a new phylum
in Biology. It's bizarre.

29:18.810 --> 29:21.479
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks
it might be a new species.

29:21.646 --> 29:24.314
Let me race to the
stands for that issue.

29:24.481 --> 29:26.653
- Why do you rag on me so much? What did I do?
- Nothing.

29:26.820 --> 29:28.822
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.

29:28.989 --> 29:30.824
There's one of you
in every school.

29:30.990 --> 29:32.992
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.

29:33.159 --> 29:35.035
You're with me.
Be brave.

29:38.455 --> 29:41.833
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

29:42.001 --> 29:43.878
Anything.

29:51.008 --> 29:54.636
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.

29:54.804 --> 29:56.639
Hey.

29:56.805 --> 30:00.767
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism
last year. Nobody cares.

30:00.934 --> 30:04.770
Well, his wife certainly didn't
when she ran off with the baby-sitter.

30:04.938 --> 30:07.690
God.

30:07.857 --> 30:10.025
- You can be such a...
- What?

30:11.818 --> 30:16.698
pretty cool human being when you're
not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.

30:19.535 --> 30:21.496
You hitting on me, Casey?

30:21.663 --> 30:24.790
No. No.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.709
I just think
you can be cool.

30:27.876 --> 30:29.714
Sometimes.

30:29.881 --> 30:32.800
This not being
one of them.

30:58.365 --> 31:01.034
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.

31:01.201 --> 31:03.745
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.

31:03.911 --> 31:07.706
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.

31:07.873 --> 31:10.375
It makes one impulsive.

31:10.543 --> 31:12.544
Has the entire faculty
been commuted?

31:12.711 --> 31:15.548
Almost.

31:15.714 --> 31:18.884
- What about the students?
- Soon.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.014
What are you two
still doing here?

31:25.181 --> 31:27.308
I thought I was
the only left.

31:30.897 --> 31:34.358
There are not enough drugs
in this world.

32:03.178 --> 32:05.012
What?

32:05.179 --> 32:07.139
I have a pain.

32:09.266 --> 32:11.059
Right here.

32:21.945 --> 32:25.864
Get off of me! Jesus!

33:14.403 --> 33:15.955
Casey!

33:18.542 --> 33:19.877
What the hell
is going on?

33:23.546 --> 33:26.799
- Slow down there.
- Help us. They killed Mrs Brummel. They're after us.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.101
What are you talking about?

33:28.102 --> 33:29.552
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.

33:29.719 --> 33:33.180
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay? They attacked her.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.519
Who attacked who?
What is going on?

33:35.686 --> 33:38.646
I have no idea. I joined this right
in the middle of it.

33:38.813 --> 33:41.690
Mrs Brummel wigged out in the shower,
and then we found her body in the faculty closet.

33:41.858 --> 33:43.526
What were you doing
in the faculty closet?

33:43.693 --> 33:46.404
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson attacked Nurse Harper.
- Why would they do that?

33:46.570 --> 33:48.280
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.

33:56.038 --> 33:57.998
Now we can get
to the bottom of this.

33:58.165 --> 34:00.500
- Fuck.
- Delilah, run!

34:05.379 --> 34:07.339
Delilah, wait!

34:29.902 --> 34:31.737
In here?

34:31.904 --> 34:34.864
Yes. The body
was in the closet.

34:35.032 --> 34:39.789
- And why would Mrs Brummel be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.

34:39.956 --> 34:42.625
- That's right.
- Hey, Casey.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.877
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.

34:46.045 --> 34:48.297
Apparently, there's been
a misunderstanding.

34:48.464 --> 34:50.549
Still, if we could just
see inside the closet.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.717
Certainly.

35:03.436 --> 35:07.314
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.

35:07.481 --> 35:10.442
We use her to teach C.P.R.
to the students,

35:10.609 --> 35:13.612
although I guess she does
resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.823
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.825
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.662
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.

35:22.828 --> 35:24.997
She was here with me.
She saw it too.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.416
They attacked Nurse Harper.

35:27.583 --> 35:31.671
- Nurse Harper is epileptic. She's prone to grand mals.
- She had an attack.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.132
Luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag,
so we were able to help her.

35:35.299 --> 35:39.013
We think it was brought on by this terrible
cold she's had. I took her home myself.

35:39.181 --> 35:42.809
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.019
You can use the phone
in my office.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.902
That was some fast running
you did down the hall, son.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.364
We could sure use your speed.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.533
There's plenty of chasing
on the field.

36:00.700 --> 36:04.161
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.957
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game tomorrow, Coach.

36:12.669 --> 36:15.045
This way.

36:23.846 --> 36:26.181
Cas,
what's gotten into you?

36:26.348 --> 36:29.517
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.

36:29.643 --> 36:31.237
I'm gonna make an appointment.

36:34.481 --> 36:37.525
He's a straight-A student,
and now he needs a professional?

36:37.691 --> 36:42.115
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink. I know what I saw.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.201
Well, we've just spoken...

36:45.326 --> 36:47.121
with both Mrs Brummel
and Nurse Harper.

36:51.416 --> 36:56.004
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.

36:56.171 --> 36:59.382
Just some kid looking
for some attention. Let's go.

36:59.549 --> 37:01.467
All right.

37:07.348 --> 37:09.558
Well–

37:09.725 --> 37:13.478
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.

37:13.645 --> 37:15.605
Maybe if you and I spoke privately,
we could come up with–

37:15.771 --> 37:17.606
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.

37:17.773 --> 37:20.900
Maybe I should see
this woman, this doctor.

37:21.068 --> 37:22.903
Can we just go?

37:23.070 --> 37:27.116
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.

37:27.282 --> 37:29.117
I can see how it all
got out of hand.

37:29.284 --> 37:33.204
It's a pretty bizarre
series of events.

37:33.372 --> 37:35.748
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.

37:35.874 --> 37:38.501
See you tomorrow, Casey.

37:45.218 --> 37:47.720
Check his school books.

37:47.845 --> 37:50.848
They hide the drugs in the spine
of the book. We saw it on Dateline.

37:50.973 --> 37:53.934
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.561
That's government property, Dad.

37:56.687 --> 37:58.564
Shit.

38:00.649 --> 38:03.610
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.

38:03.777 --> 38:07.948
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

38:08.114 --> 38:12.284
Something really weird
is happening at school. The teachers–

38:12.452 --> 38:14.621
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?

38:14.787 --> 38:17.998
- I'm bending as far as I can, but if you push it–
- Just let me call Delilah.

38:18.123 --> 38:19.750
Please?

38:19.917 --> 38:23.294
Okay, that's it.

38:23.462 --> 38:25.130
Your privileges
are now over.

38:25.297 --> 38:29.843
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.

38:32.345 --> 38:35.306
You'll go to school, straight to school,
and you'll come straight home. You got it?

38:35.474 --> 38:39.143
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.

38:39.310 --> 38:43.192
You'll go. If I have to tie you
to the desk myself, you'll go.

38:43.359 --> 38:45.360
No music.

38:45.527 --> 38:47.028
His porno.

38:47.195 --> 38:49.530
Porno.

38:53.326 --> 38:56.620
Sorry, pal. No more
flogging the bishop.

38:56.787 --> 39:00.458
We are gonna
get you help. Don't worry.

39:00.625 --> 39:03.711
Get your room
cleaned up.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.253
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

39:46.420 --> 39:48.672
Dad. They're here.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.090
The faculty.

39:51.257 --> 39:56.136
Get in the house, now.

39:57.263 --> 39:59.306
I'm losing it.

40:26.456 --> 40:30.083
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.

40:30.251 --> 40:32.296
Please.

40:32.462 --> 40:34.422
Come home
right after school.

40:34.589 --> 40:37.591
Your mom's
looking into a doctor.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.903
Mr Connor.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.733
Delilah.
Wow, you look–

41:36.899 --> 41:39.235
Don't. Come on.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.236
Your attention, please.

41:41.403 --> 41:43.363
Will the following students
report to the office:

41:43.488 --> 41:46.824
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen,

41:46.992 --> 41:49.330
and Delilah Proffitt.

41:49.497 --> 41:51.665
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?

41:51.832 --> 41:53.750
Do you think I'm in drag
for the aesthetics?

41:53.917 --> 41:55.752
They're after me.

41:55.919 --> 41:58.046
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.

41:58.213 --> 42:00.173
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.

42:00.341 --> 42:02.175
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.

42:02.301 --> 42:04.595
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.

42:04.762 --> 42:07.264
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.

42:07.431 --> 42:09.599
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?

42:09.766 --> 42:12.351
Casey, we don't even know
who "they" are.

42:12.519 --> 42:14.354
Why did she act
like everything was okay?

42:14.521 --> 42:16.355
It's a devil's cult
or something.

42:16.522 --> 42:18.607
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?

42:18.774 --> 42:20.609
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped
bathroom for the rest of my life.

42:20.776 --> 42:22.318
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?

42:22.485 --> 42:25.863
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?

43:03.776 --> 43:06.696
Will the following students
please report to the office:

43:06.863 --> 43:10.449
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.

43:10.574 --> 43:12.451
You should just
go talk to him.

43:12.617 --> 43:15.329
No way.

43:17.331 --> 43:19.250
I'm sorry.

43:21.543 --> 43:24.420
So you– Are you ready
for the big game?

43:24.587 --> 43:27.631
I quit the team.

43:27.756 --> 43:31.718
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

43:31.886 --> 43:33.720
Why?

43:37.975 --> 43:42.312
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.

43:42.479 --> 43:48.067
You know... the coach, the students,
even the teachers.

43:48.234 --> 43:50.653
Last year after we won
the 2A Conference–

43:50.819 --> 43:53.033
That was thanks to you
and your completed passes.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.244
You follow the games?

43:56.412 --> 43:59.915
I wouldn't
have guessed that.

44:00.082 --> 44:02.292
I made a "D" on a biology test
right after,

44:02.459 --> 44:06.086
and Mr Furlong
changed it to an "A."

44:06.253 --> 44:09.298
He said I deserved
for having such a strong arm.

44:09.466 --> 44:12.468
That really bugged me,
you know?

44:12.594 --> 44:16.889
I worked hard for that "D."
That was my "D." I deserved that "D."

44:18.723 --> 44:22.268
I just wish people
would let me be, you know–

44:22.436 --> 44:24.271
A "D" student.

44:24.437 --> 44:27.189
Yeah.

44:35.531 --> 44:38.659
Okay, class, listen up.

44:38.826 --> 44:42.496
Today we are going to write
a living family history.

44:42.663 --> 44:46.249
Everyone take out a piece of paper
and write down the name...

44:46.417 --> 44:48.335
of every living member
of your family.

44:48.502 --> 44:52.005
Begin with your immediate family–
those living with you–

44:52.172 --> 44:55.469
then include the names
of your nearest living relatives.

44:55.636 --> 44:58.221
What?

44:58.389 --> 45:02.851
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.

45:07.771 --> 45:09.648
What is that?

45:11.943 --> 45:14.779
It's magic dust.

45:14.946 --> 45:18.615
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance, but thank you.

45:18.782 --> 45:21.618
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin,

45:21.784 --> 45:24.495
so that would
probably kill me.

45:24.663 --> 45:28.249
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.

45:28.416 --> 45:32.002
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta.

45:32.169 --> 45:34.546
Atlanta.
I know.

45:34.712 --> 45:36.964
That's right.
You know everything.

45:37.132 --> 45:39.050
I'm Zeke.

45:39.217 --> 45:41.803
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.

45:41.970 --> 45:44.139
The pleasure's
all mine.

45:46.307 --> 45:49.977
There's a mandatory meeting in the office
at lunch today for all club presidents.

45:50.145 --> 45:52.814
Remember, tonight we take on
the Brun County Changa.

45:52.981 --> 45:56.108
- Please come at 5:30 and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.

45:58.321 --> 46:00.323
Weird, isn't it?

46:00.490 --> 46:04.034
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?

46:04.202 --> 46:06.954
Something weird
is going on here.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.302
Hey, Football.

46:22.469 --> 46:24.971
Hey, Gabe.

46:25.137 --> 46:28.473
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?

46:28.641 --> 46:30.267
I'm the new team captain.

46:38.774 --> 46:40.109
What's going on here?

46:40.276 --> 46:44.322
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam
or some shit like that.

46:44.489 --> 46:46.407
And that takes the police?

46:47.825 --> 46:50.494
Stan, I need
to talk to you.

46:50.661 --> 46:52.495
I didn't know
you wore glasses.

46:52.663 --> 46:55.082
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.

46:59.672 --> 47:02.257
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.

47:04.634 --> 47:09.472
So after the accident, I came here
to live with relatives, you know.

47:09.640 --> 47:15.312
So I moved in
with my cousins and... here I am.

47:17.272 --> 47:19.649
Fucking do something,
you pussy puke!

47:19.817 --> 47:21.652
Yeah, my mom and dad
are dead too.

47:21.818 --> 47:24.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:24.612 --> 47:27.781
They're still breathing,
but for all intents and purposes,

47:27.948 --> 47:29.950
they're very much dead.

47:32.203 --> 47:35.080
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.

47:35.247 --> 47:38.416
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.

47:42.002 --> 47:44.504
Yeah.

47:44.672 --> 47:48.759
- You notice anything off today here at school?
- I'm from the south.

47:48.926 --> 47:51.470
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.

47:51.637 --> 47:53.638
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.

47:53.805 --> 47:58.142
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man,
how's the new you working out?

47:58.310 --> 48:01.232
Working out just fine.

48:01.398 --> 48:03.400
Hey, you got any more?

48:03.567 --> 48:05.485
- Sure, man.
- Really?

48:05.652 --> 48:09.530
Why don't you give us
all you got?

48:09.698 --> 48:12.075
All right.
Dough.

48:12.241 --> 48:16.621
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.

48:16.788 --> 48:20.666
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car? Got any more there?

48:23.085 --> 48:26.589
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.

48:26.756 --> 48:29.967
- Check out Miss Burke.
- Wow, what happened to her?

48:30.134 --> 48:35.680
Man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.

48:37.015 --> 48:38.933
- What's up with her?
- Not today.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.894
It's too damn hot, and I got
zero-fucking-tolerance.

48:42.061 --> 48:47.733
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with
no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.

48:47.901 --> 48:50.778
Ouch. Comeback.

48:50.945 --> 48:52.863
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?

48:53.030 --> 48:55.615
And how am I supposed to do
that, little Zekey boy?

48:55.782 --> 48:57.783
Do you even know
where she is?

48:57.950 --> 49:02.917
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what
remote location she went to this week...

49:03.084 --> 49:07.338
to hide from her
great big bastard mistake.

49:07.505 --> 49:09.589
I've taken your shit
for too fucking long,

49:09.756 --> 49:12.550
you dickless drug-induced
excuse for a human being.

49:12.717 --> 49:15.678
- Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?

49:15.845 --> 49:18.098
I'm sick of you,
little boy.

49:18.265 --> 49:21.768
And if I see you peddling
your wonder dust again,

49:21.935 --> 49:25.396
I'm gonna shove my foot
so far up your ass...

49:25.562 --> 49:27.814
you'll be sucking my toes
till graduation.

49:31.818 --> 49:33.053
Big trouble.

49:33.820 --> 49:36.656
She got some bad shit.

49:39.242 --> 49:42.204
And then they chased us,
but we got away.

49:42.329 --> 49:44.789
All this started when Mrs Brummel
did a wet and wild...

49:44.956 --> 49:47.500
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.

49:47.666 --> 49:52.796
Everybody's been acting really strange,
especially the faculty.

49:52.964 --> 49:55.842
Tell me about it. It's like they've
all turned into fucking pod people...

49:56.008 --> 49:57.343
- or something.
- Into what people?

49:57.510 --> 50:03.097
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.

50:03.264 --> 50:04.643
That was a joke.

50:04.811 --> 50:07.146
Look, what if it
really happened?

50:07.313 --> 50:11.108
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's taking over our school.

50:11.274 --> 50:13.943
The Body Snatchers is a story
somebody made up, dingus.

50:14.068 --> 50:15.945
It's located in the fiction
section of the library.

50:16.112 --> 50:19.991
So is Schindler's List. All fiction
is based on some truth, right?

50:20.158 --> 50:22.702
What does Miss Burke teach us
in English 101? Write what you know.

50:22.869 --> 50:24.704
How do we know
this writer guy...

50:24.871 --> 50:26.539
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens in his high school...

50:26.705 --> 50:29.708
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion?

50:29.876 --> 50:32.044
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?

50:32.211 --> 50:34.671
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers
is a blatant rip-off...

50:34.838 --> 50:36.673
of The Puppet Masters
by Robert Heinlein.

50:36.839 --> 50:39.008
So you can completely disregard
that entire work.

50:39.175 --> 50:41.093
Whatever.
The point is they're here,

50:41.260 --> 50:43.094
they've been here
and they're here again.

50:43.262 --> 50:45.973
You know, Casey, I think you've been racked
into the flagpole one too many times.

50:46.139 --> 50:47.682
Look, how do you know
there's not a conspiracy?

50:47.849 --> 50:49.767
Maybe X-Files is right.

50:49.934 --> 50:52.520
Where do all these movies
come from anyway?

50:52.687 --> 50:55.148
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,

50:55.315 --> 50:58.026
Emmerich haven't been
visited by aliens?

50:58.193 --> 51:00.028
You know, maybe they're
aliens themselves.

51:00.195 --> 51:02.489
Maybe they're simply preparing us
for what's to come.

51:02.656 --> 51:04.657
You know what, Casey,
it's fiction. Okay?

51:04.824 --> 51:06.787
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.

51:06.954 --> 51:09.831
Everybody gets hung up on the science
part, which has nothing to do with it.

51:09.999 --> 51:12.042
They're getting at us
through the fiction.

51:12.209 --> 51:14.919
So, aliens have just been
setting us up over the years,

51:15.086 --> 51:17.004
creating this happy little
make-believe existence...

51:17.171 --> 51:19.006
with their E.T.
and their Men In Black movies...

51:19.173 --> 51:21.676
just so that nobody would believe it
if it really happened?

51:21.843 --> 51:24.929
I think so.
Yeah.

51:27.139 --> 51:30.058
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.

51:30.225 --> 51:33.728
But it's kind of cool.

51:33.896 --> 51:35.647
Okay, so what's missing?

51:35.814 --> 51:39.358
Well, in The Body Snatchers,
they were pods, but where are they?

51:39.525 --> 51:41.360
I mean, where are the pods?

51:41.527 --> 51:43.778
There are no pods.

51:43.945 --> 51:46.823
There's gotta be
something else.

51:48.283 --> 51:50.660
In Puppet Masters,
they were parasites.

51:56.624 --> 52:00.085
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's onto something.

52:00.253 --> 52:02.046
Really?

52:04.006 --> 52:05.841
Shit.

52:08.012 --> 52:10.681
Furlong must have sent it
up to the university.

52:10.806 --> 52:13.933
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?

52:16.244 --> 52:17.679
What? What is it?

52:19.190 --> 52:22.067
Will someone please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

52:22.234 --> 52:26.738
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.

52:26.906 --> 52:28.782
Which is now missing.

52:32.661 --> 52:36.122
We think aliens are
taking over our school.

52:39.292 --> 52:41.627
Right. Come on.

52:41.794 --> 52:43.128
You saw what Brummel
did in the shower.

52:43.295 --> 52:45.964
I saw her dead body
in the closet.

52:46.131 --> 52:49.800
They've been calling students into the office.
The students with the most influence on down,

52:49.968 --> 52:52.136
including the new team captain.

52:52.303 --> 52:54.138
Looks like you picked
the right week to quit football.

52:54.306 --> 52:56.141
You think aliens have
infested our school?

52:57.767 --> 53:01.103
That would explain their weird
behaviour, wouldn't it?

53:01.270 --> 53:03.313
Give me a fucking break.

53:13.784 --> 53:15.910
So, what are we
doing in here?

53:16.078 --> 53:19.205
Shopping.

53:19.372 --> 53:23.626
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?

53:23.792 --> 53:25.795
This is where
I get my equipment.

53:25.962 --> 53:27.963
You borrow it
from science labs?

53:28.131 --> 53:30.550
I like to think of it
as stealing, actually.

53:33.147 --> 53:36.222
Just doing my part to the
deconstruction of America.

53:40.977 --> 53:44.063
So if anybody
finds us in here,

53:44.229 --> 53:46.231
just grab ahold of me and pretend
we're making out.

53:46.398 --> 53:48.941
The punishment
will be less severe.

54:04.956 --> 54:07.208
- Aliens?
- Do you have a better explanation, Stan?

54:07.376 --> 54:11.758
Great. Just listen to yourselves.
Our teachers are aliens?

54:11.925 --> 54:14.802
That's not weird,
that's fucking psychotic.

54:14.969 --> 54:17.221
Come on, guys.
This is nuts.

54:17.388 --> 54:19.723
Then leave, Stan. Why are you
hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.

54:19.891 --> 54:21.976
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.

54:22.142 --> 54:24.315
Get the fuck out of here
and take your freak dyke with you.

54:24.346 --> 54:25.296
Fuck you, tit bags.

54:25.312 --> 54:28.523
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.

54:28.690 --> 54:33.611
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?

54:33.779 --> 54:35.780
Why Ohio?

54:35.947 --> 54:37.949
If you were going
to take over the world,

54:38.115 --> 54:40.576
would you blow up the White House
Independence Day style...

54:40.742 --> 54:44.037
or sneak in
through the backdoor?

54:54.297 --> 54:56.132
Casey.

54:56.298 --> 55:00.511
Man, the only person
in this school who is an alien...

55:00.679 --> 55:02.555
is you, man.

55:02.722 --> 55:04.242
Fuck you, Zeke.

55:06.809 --> 55:08.685
What's going on here?

55:11.063 --> 55:13.440
Shouldn't you people
be in class?

55:13.610 --> 55:16.946
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,

55:17.113 --> 55:20.824
Casey here
thinks you're an alien.

55:23.952 --> 55:28.706
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.

55:30.292 --> 55:32.127
Is that true?

55:35.797 --> 55:37.632
Casey?

55:39.133 --> 55:42.803
The thing I found yesterday–
Where is it?

55:42.970 --> 55:45.138
I sent it to the university.

55:45.305 --> 55:48.057
Do they know what it is?

55:51.352 --> 55:55.147
Look, sorry to impose and
disrupt, Mr Furlong, but–

55:55.314 --> 55:58.274
If you'd kindly take your seats,
this will be over quite quickly.

55:58.441 --> 56:00.569
Now sit down!

56:09.078 --> 56:13.831
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.

56:17.588 --> 56:19.882
Goddamn it!

56:20.049 --> 56:21.967
Come on.

56:22.134 --> 56:24.469
No!

57:14.129 --> 57:15.198
Zeke.

57:28.614 --> 57:30.699
This is usually the point where somebody
says, "Let's get the fuck outta here."

57:30.867 --> 57:32.953
Let's get the fuck outta here.

57:38.249 --> 57:40.500
Aliens are taking over
the fucking school.

57:43.921 --> 57:45.672
We gotta have proof.

57:47.298 --> 57:49.133
All right, everybody,
here's the deal.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.468
We're heading straight
for the parking lot.

57:51.635 --> 57:54.596
Pull it together,
and try to stay calm.

58:29.297 --> 58:31.048
Stokely.

58:35.429 --> 58:37.722
What's Stan hanging out
with those guys for?

58:46.647 --> 58:48.982
Delilah.

59:04.330 --> 59:06.833
My car.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.252
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

59:10.419 --> 59:12.462
Wait.
Stan!

59:12.630 --> 59:15.466
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?

59:15.633 --> 59:17.968
- We're going to–
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.

59:18.135 --> 59:20.345
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?

59:20.511 --> 59:23.434
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.

59:35.111 --> 59:38.073
What the fuck is going on?

59:38.241 --> 59:40.326
Let's see if anybody's talking.

59:47.288 --> 59:49.792
Who the fuck are these guys?

59:49.958 --> 59:52.169
All right,
pull over here, fellas.

59:52.336 --> 59:56.381
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!

01:00:26.078 --> 01:00:28.872
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.505
Shit.

01:00:37.672 --> 01:00:41.384
- My God.
- This is some serious shit.

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:53.186
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?

01:00:53.353 --> 01:00:55.480
You didn't see that.

01:00:55.648 --> 01:00:58.984
What are we gonna do with
the police not being an option?

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.402
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.

01:01:01.569 --> 01:01:03.612
If he's even
your dad anymore.

01:01:09.536 --> 01:01:11.579
It's called a gun, man.

01:01:22.506 --> 01:01:24.591
What is it?

01:01:26.429 --> 01:01:28.639
We're gonna find out.

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.434
Hey, come here, Oscar.

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:34.936
Come here, buddy.

01:01:51.535 --> 01:01:53.995
Jeez.

01:02:07.465 --> 01:02:09.717
Now what?

01:02:09.884 --> 01:02:12.053
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:02:35.411 --> 01:02:38.414
See? It's a parasite.

01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:42.711
It attaches itself to a host,
and then it controls it.

01:02:48.924 --> 01:02:51.926
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?

01:02:52.094 --> 01:02:55.097
It can survive on its own, but it's
really part of a greater organism.

01:02:55.263 --> 01:02:58.766
Look, it has the ability to replicate,
but it needs a host.

01:02:58.933 --> 01:03:00.809
Something moist.

01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:03.812
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.648
Hey, isn't a human body
composed mainly of water?

01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:07.858
They're using us.

01:03:08.025 --> 01:03:10.110
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?

01:03:10.276 --> 01:03:11.944
I overheard the coach.

01:03:12.111 --> 01:03:13.947
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.

01:03:14.114 --> 01:03:16.032
See, this partially explains
what happened to Furlong.

01:03:21.287 --> 01:03:25.957
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.

01:03:26.124 --> 01:03:28.838
They're using us as hosts. They're just
turning us into mindless slaves...

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:32.091
- they can control.
- How do you know that?

01:03:32.258 --> 01:03:35.010
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.

01:03:35.177 --> 01:03:37.596
Who's been right so far.

01:03:37.762 --> 01:03:39.722
How do we stop it?

01:03:39.889 --> 01:03:43.017
Yeah, Stokely,
this is your area.

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.731
In theory,
they're all connected.

01:03:47.897 --> 01:03:50.942
- If we kill the master, we get them all.
- "In theory."

01:03:51.108 --> 01:03:53.111
What happens to everybody else?

01:03:53.278 --> 01:03:55.780
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?

01:03:55.948 --> 01:03:58.658
No, they don't.
They would become human again.

01:03:58.825 --> 01:04:01.410
But that is
in theory, so–

01:04:01.577 --> 01:04:03.870
So if we found the leader
and killed it,

01:04:04.037 --> 01:04:06.706
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?

01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:08.959
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?

01:04:09.126 --> 01:04:12.545
Don't you see? We got to stop it
or it's gonna spread.

01:04:12.712 --> 01:04:14.922
It took the high school
in a day and a half.

01:04:15.089 --> 01:04:18.426
Give it a week,
we'll never outrun it.

01:04:18.592 --> 01:04:21.136
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?

01:04:21.304 --> 01:04:24.056
We don't even know
who's alien and who's not.

01:04:24.223 --> 01:04:26.767
What if one of us was an alien
right now? How would we know?

01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:30.061
He's right. How do I know
you're really Casey?

01:04:30.228 --> 01:04:31.941
How do I know
you're really you?

01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:35.195
In Body Snatchers,
humans became emotionless.

01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:38.489
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.

01:04:38.656 --> 01:04:41.575
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass,
but he was different somehow.

01:04:41.742 --> 01:04:43.994
His behaviour
was slightly odd.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.080
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously
quits the football team?

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:49.083
What are you doing, Delilah?

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.085
I'm just pointing out
your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.

01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:53.795
You've been acting really weird
the last couple of days.

01:04:53.962 --> 01:04:57.089
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.

01:04:57.257 --> 01:05:00.426
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?

01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:02.511
What about you? You haven't been
without your contacts...

01:05:02.678 --> 01:05:04.430
or hair spray
since birth.

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:08.141
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.

01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:12.353
And I'm supposed to trust you? Tell me something,
Miss Lesbian, when did you start liking boys?

01:05:12.521 --> 01:05:15.482
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.

01:05:15.649 --> 01:05:18.819
So when did you stop
muff-diving?

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:20.445
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:22.655
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:22.823 --> 01:05:25.492
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:29.203
It's just really convenient that you showed up
the second all these things started happening.

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:33.460
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.

01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.878
Hey, shut up.

01:05:36.046 --> 01:05:38.048
She's got a point, Zeke.

01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:41.926
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.

01:05:42.092 --> 01:05:45.303
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot
about this stuff.

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:49.558
No offence, but you're not exactly known
for your academic achievements.

01:05:49.725 --> 01:05:52.144
Neither are you, man.

01:05:52.311 --> 01:05:56.397
- Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha–

01:05:56.564 --> 01:05:58.774
All right,
this is getting us nowhere.

01:06:12.661 --> 01:06:14.830
I got a solution.

01:06:14.997 --> 01:06:19.335
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.

01:06:19.502 --> 01:06:23.088
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.

01:06:23.255 --> 01:06:27.009
Come on, man. If you're not an alien,
you got nothing to worry about.

01:06:27.177 --> 01:06:29.512
Zeke's right.

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:32.556
This is the only way
to know for sure.

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:35.061
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?

01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:37.521
Look, we all do it.

01:06:42.526 --> 01:06:45.696
- Casey.
- Why me first?

01:06:45.862 --> 01:06:47.614
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:03.437
Easy, boy.

01:07:10.552 --> 01:07:14.179
What about you, Zeke? How do we know
you're not one of those fucking things?

01:07:17.265 --> 01:07:19.434
I don't get high
on my own stash, man.

01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.395
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.

01:07:21.562 --> 01:07:24.565
You're taking it.

01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:30.920
Now what the hell's wrong with him?

01:07:31.987 --> 01:07:33.566
Nothing's wrong with him,
you asshole.

01:07:33.572 --> 01:07:34.824
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!

01:07:37.079 --> 01:07:39.414
Tweak. Tweak.

01:07:39.581 --> 01:07:41.624
Now you.

01:07:57.182 --> 01:07:59.642
Your turn.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.122
Stokely.

01:08:25.624 --> 01:08:28.292
I'm not putting that hack drug
up my nose.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.962
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over the Earth. Weigh it.

01:08:35.466 --> 01:08:39.305
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine. Some other household shit.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.481
Shit.

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:54.611
Now you,
Delilah.

01:08:56.113 --> 01:09:00.433
No. Her first.

01:09:01.201 --> 01:09:04.246
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?

01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:10.292
Is she always this much fun, man?

01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:13.502
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.

01:09:17.049 --> 01:09:19.926
You know what I'm saying? You know?

01:09:25.433 --> 01:09:27.768
You both take it.

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.687
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.

01:09:33.772 --> 01:09:35.607
You have to take it.

01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:47.455
Showdown.

01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:07.724
Del?

01:10:15.505 --> 01:10:16.481
Shit!

01:10:26.116 --> 01:10:28.785
Shoot her. Shoot her
in the head, Casey.

01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:31.496
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.

01:10:31.664 --> 01:10:35.417
- Don't shoot her, Casey.
- Shoot her, Casey. She's fucking one of them, man!

01:10:35.584 --> 01:10:38.461
There's nowhere to go.

01:10:38.628 --> 01:10:39.920
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.

01:10:40.087 --> 01:10:42.550
I'll fucking shoot her.

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:45.454
Shit!

01:10:52.017 --> 01:10:53.560
Jesus!

01:10:57.774 --> 01:10:59.650
Get her!

01:11:01.217 --> 01:11:02.319
She's getting away!

01:11:02.486 --> 01:11:05.697
- Hurry!
- Shit!

01:11:12.078 --> 01:11:15.289
I should have known that
crazy bitch was one of them.

01:11:15.455 --> 01:11:17.332
We can get her back, Zeke.

01:11:17.499 --> 01:11:19.459
We can get them all back.

01:11:22.426 --> 01:11:24.209
She destroyed most of my supply.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.052
Look, if we kill the queen,
we can get them all back.

01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:34.891
Fuck!

01:11:42.314 --> 01:11:45.695
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.

01:11:45.863 --> 01:11:47.822
But we only need enough
to get the queen.

01:11:47.989 --> 01:11:50.783
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:55.829
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night? Only one place she can be.

01:12:08.674 --> 01:12:10.053
Go Hornets!

01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:18.100
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!

01:12:18.266 --> 01:12:21.519
Tackled by four Hornets
with authority.

01:12:27.191 --> 01:12:32.196
Somebody stung
by the Hornets!

01:12:38.869 --> 01:12:42.872
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:44.290
Jesus.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.219
Get in there
and take his fucking head off.

01:12:58.264 --> 01:12:59.682
Kill! Kill!

01:13:10.484 --> 01:13:12.736
Kill!

01:13:22.078 --> 01:13:24.163
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.124
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.

01:13:29.418 --> 01:13:33.756
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.

01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:37.842
By morning, there won't be
a human left.

01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:53.234
Come on.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.713
Where are you guys?

01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:17.757
We found Drake.
She's at the game.

01:14:17.924 --> 01:14:19.925
What are you kids
doing in here?

01:14:24.138 --> 01:14:28.850
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.

01:14:30.852 --> 01:14:32.687
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.

01:14:34.607 --> 01:14:37.734
Why is that?

01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:40.361
Get her.

01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:42.655
Quick, Zeke, get the doors!

01:14:44.824 --> 01:14:48.077
Get me out!
You're all expelled!

01:14:48.244 --> 01:14:51.667
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.

01:14:53.168 --> 01:14:56.421
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:14:58.382 --> 01:14:59.674
What are you doing?

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:04.970
- You ready?
- Yep.

01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:09.266
Sniff this.

01:15:09.433 --> 01:15:12.894
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.106
I will not.

01:15:16.273 --> 01:15:18.149
Now what?

01:15:25.239 --> 01:15:27.074
We do it the hard way.

01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:31.120
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his
eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.

01:15:31.287 --> 01:15:34.081
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her
before it erupts all over the place.

01:15:34.247 --> 01:15:35.874
Casey, are you on drugs?

01:15:39.295 --> 01:15:42.214
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?

01:15:42.381 --> 01:15:44.424
Please don't, Casey!

01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:46.551
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!

01:16:01.526 --> 01:16:03.361
What if we were wrong?

01:16:05.488 --> 01:16:07.949
Stab it
and find out.

01:16:19.334 --> 01:16:22.169
I think we made a mistake, guys.

01:16:23.671 --> 01:16:26.048
She's dead.

01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:34.139
Easy!

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.230
Is that it?

01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.249
Let's see if it worked.

01:17:14.137 --> 01:17:15.972
It better have worked,

01:17:16.139 --> 01:17:18.724
or there are gonna be
a lot of infected people going home.

01:17:18.892 --> 01:17:21.936
We're right at ground zero.

01:17:24.939 --> 01:17:28.275
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.

01:17:30.527 --> 01:17:32.862
I'm gonna need some scat.

01:17:34.447 --> 01:17:36.449
Use it wisely, man.

01:17:42.538 --> 01:17:44.157
What if it wasn't Drake?

01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:47.459
Then we're fucked.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.019
I just don't want
to never have done that.

01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:18.991
What are you looking at?

01:18:30.168 --> 01:18:32.003
Coach.

01:18:50.646 --> 01:18:53.189
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.

01:18:53.356 --> 01:18:55.691
Any sign of him?

01:18:58.238 --> 01:19:00.865
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:03.702
Quick, Stokely,
open the door.

01:19:03.827 --> 01:19:05.828
No, Stokely! We don't know
if it's still him.

01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:07.997
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.

01:19:08.163 --> 01:19:10.374
It's the coach,
and he's right after me. Open the door.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.918
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?

01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:16.964
I lost it. The coach was too fast for me.
Please, Stokely, don't leave me out here.

01:19:17.131 --> 01:19:21.177
- Last one, man.
- Please, I'm begging you! Don't leave me out here!

01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:23.804
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.

01:19:23.971 --> 01:19:26.014
Okay, I'll do it. I'll–
Just let me do it inside.

01:19:26.182 --> 01:19:28.308
Do it right now, man.

01:19:28.434 --> 01:19:30.644
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man. Prove it to us.

01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:32.770
Okay.

01:19:45.157 --> 01:19:46.617
Fuck!

01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:50.870
Fuck!

01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:53.498
Open the door.

01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:56.959
It is so much better.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.549
There's no fear...
or pain.

01:19:59.674 --> 01:20:02.092
It's beautiful.

01:20:02.259 --> 01:20:05.803
And you will be beautiful.

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.723
You'll be beautiful.

01:20:07.889 --> 01:20:11.434
No problems or worries.

01:20:11.601 --> 01:20:14.771
We want you.

01:20:14.938 --> 01:20:17.190
I want you.

01:20:17.357 --> 01:20:20.026
I want you.

01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:22.236
Now open the fucking door!

01:20:22.403 --> 01:20:24.238
- Open the door!
- Come away.

01:20:24.405 --> 01:20:26.840
Go a-fucking-way, Stan!

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:31.202
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:33.288
No pain, Stan?

01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:36.457
Well, come in here,
and I'll show you some fucking pain!

01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:53.807
I say we go for the coach.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.142
He turned Stan.
He's the one.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.230
Would you rather wait
for them to come to us?

01:21:00.396 --> 01:21:03.193
Either way,
we're completely unarmed.

01:21:03.318 --> 01:21:05.570
Maybe not. I might
have some more scat.

01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:07.238
Where?

01:21:07.406 --> 01:21:10.742
- In my trunk.
- In your trunk.

01:21:10.909 --> 01:21:15.746
In your car, amongst the aliens.
That's convenient.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.916
You got a better idea?

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.962
Stan?

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.049
You out there, buddy?

01:21:58.319 --> 01:22:00.038
Does it really take two of us
to get to your car?

01:22:01.289 --> 01:22:04.920
Nope. One of us
is a decoy.

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:10.716
Get him!

01:22:13.469 --> 01:22:16.222
Where did he go?

01:22:16.347 --> 01:22:19.517
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!

01:22:24.647 --> 01:22:26.490
Hello, Casey.

01:22:27.774 --> 01:22:29.651
Where are you gonna go?

01:22:29.776 --> 01:22:32.987
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser...

01:22:33.154 --> 01:22:37.490
who comes to school every day
knowing that this is it.

01:22:37.658 --> 01:22:39.576
You've been
labelled pathetic...

01:22:39.743 --> 01:22:43.079
since first grade, and you're afraid it's
gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.

01:22:43.246 --> 01:22:45.081
But we can stop it, Casey.

01:22:45.248 --> 01:22:47.499
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?

01:22:47.624 --> 01:22:49.251
Please don't do this,
Delilah.

01:22:49.419 --> 01:22:52.547
I haven't been this happy
since probably–

01:22:52.714 --> 01:22:54.841
since before my dad died.

01:22:56.592 --> 01:22:58.260
You know you want me, Casey.

01:22:58.427 --> 01:23:01.471
Come on.
Let's do it together.

01:23:31.419 --> 01:23:34.297
Hello, Miss Burke.

01:23:34.422 --> 01:23:36.298
Hello, sweetie pie.

01:23:38.508 --> 01:23:42.136
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.

01:23:42.304 --> 01:23:45.640
So, I take it you changed your mind
about the chocolate laxatives?

01:23:45.807 --> 01:23:50.811
Actually, I had my heart set on something
cherry-flavoured. You know what I mean?

01:23:50.977 --> 01:23:53.480
Sorry, I'm all out of those.

01:23:57.318 --> 01:24:00.278
I might have something else
for you though.

01:24:00.445 --> 01:24:02.572
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:02.697 --> 01:24:07.245
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.

01:24:17.504 --> 01:24:19.506
Hello, Zekey boy.

01:24:27.014 --> 01:24:31.268
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.

01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:41.503
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.

01:25:51.388 --> 01:25:54.974
I always thought the only alien
in this high school was me.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:02.689
Not the case.

01:26:05.526 --> 01:26:08.945
Who do you think it is,
the master alien, the queen bee?

01:26:09.112 --> 01:26:12.951
It could be anyone.

01:26:13.118 --> 01:26:14.995
What happens at the end
of these stories, Stokely?

01:26:15.121 --> 01:26:18.540
How does Invasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:22.710
They get us.
They win. We lose.

01:26:25.212 --> 01:26:29.675
Do we?
Maybe we really win.

01:26:29.843 --> 01:26:31.928
Stan didn't
look unhappy.

01:26:32.095 --> 01:26:34.555
That's 'cause
it wasn't Stan.

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.598
They took away
who he was.

01:26:39.351 --> 01:26:42.604
Maybe they just bettered
who he was,

01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:46.232
cleared away
his confusion.

01:26:49.651 --> 01:26:55.489
I know you pride yourself
on being the outsider, Stokely,

01:26:55.657 --> 01:26:59.953
but aren't you tired
of being something you're not?

01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:06.544
I know I am.

01:27:20.559 --> 01:27:22.310
No fucking way!

01:27:41.702 --> 01:27:43.287
Shit!

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:50.877
Run, Stokes!

01:27:55.214 --> 01:27:56.966
Stokes!

01:28:07.559 --> 01:28:10.270
Stokely!

01:28:10.438 --> 01:28:15.153
Stokes! Stokes!

01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:21.950
Stokely!

01:28:23.912 --> 01:28:26.705
No!

01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:29.374
Stokely!

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:40.260
Come on, Stokes.
Run!

01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:42.887
Come on!

01:29:34.645 --> 01:29:37.398
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.

01:29:37.565 --> 01:29:40.110
Watch out.
It's her.

01:29:40.277 --> 01:29:44.697
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.

01:29:44.864 --> 01:29:47.074
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.

01:29:47.241 --> 01:29:49.075
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.

01:29:49.242 --> 01:29:54.663
We don't know what she is:
gay, straight, alien.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.001
Answer me something,
Marybeth:

01:29:59.168 --> 01:30:01.378
Why are you naked?

01:30:03.882 --> 01:30:07.176
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?

01:30:07.343 --> 01:30:11.138
- I'm getting kind of used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.

01:30:11.304 --> 01:30:16.100
Zeke, how the hell can you
be sure what you saw?

01:30:17.519 --> 01:30:21.568
It was sweet of you
to bond with me.

01:30:21.734 --> 01:30:23.611
To be nice to me was sweet.

01:30:26.947 --> 01:30:28.990
Will it work again, baby?

01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:32.786
Do you like
what you see?

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.626
Zeke.

01:30:57.893 --> 01:31:00.729
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.

01:31:00.895 --> 01:31:03.272
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

01:31:03.439 --> 01:31:06.484
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for
five minutes, and everyone's an alien.

01:31:06.651 --> 01:31:09.737
Now if I have to Men In Black your ass,
you're gonna fucking sniff it.

01:31:11.948 --> 01:31:14.158
Happy now?

01:31:33.845 --> 01:31:36.682
Jesus. I'm fucking
seeing two of everything.

01:31:39.434 --> 01:31:42.270
Zeke. Zeke!

01:31:49.943 --> 01:31:52.612
Come on, buddy.
Get up.

01:31:58.199 --> 01:31:59.276
He's over here.

01:32:14.132 --> 01:32:18.845
Casey, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:32:24.687 --> 01:32:27.356
You know,
in my world, Casey,

01:32:27.481 --> 01:32:31.276
there were limitless oceans
as far as the eye could see.

01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:34.195
A beautiful home
until it started to dry up.

01:32:34.362 --> 01:32:36.488
So I escaped,

01:32:36.656 --> 01:32:39.993
came here and met you.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.578
All of you.

01:32:42.745 --> 01:32:45.247
All of you were different
from the others.

01:32:45.414 --> 01:32:47.290
Thanks, pal.

01:32:47.457 --> 01:32:49.876
You were lost and lonely,
just like me.

01:32:50.044 --> 01:32:55.048
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world:

01:32:55.214 --> 01:32:59.718
a world without anger,
without fear, without attitude.

01:32:59.885 --> 01:33:03.221
Where the underachiever
goes home at night to parents who care.

01:33:03.389 --> 01:33:06.224
The jock can be smart,
the ugly duckling beautiful,

01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:08.560
and the class wuss doesn't
have to live in terror.

01:33:08.727 --> 01:33:14.148
And the new girl– Well, she can just fit
right in with people who are just like her.

01:33:17.902 --> 01:33:21.738
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's
feelings can be hurt...

01:33:21.905 --> 01:33:24.744
by a bunch of pathetic,
lost, little outcasts...

01:33:24.911 --> 01:33:28.580
who truly believe that their
disaffected lonely life...

01:33:28.748 --> 01:33:31.083
is the only way
they can survive.

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:35.546
I can make you a part of something
so special, Casey, so perfect,

01:33:35.713 --> 01:33:37.923
so fearless.

01:33:40.927 --> 01:33:42.762
Don't you want that, Casey?

01:33:42.929 --> 01:33:45.890
I'd rather be afraid.

01:33:46.056 --> 01:33:49.351
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.

01:33:49.517 --> 01:33:52.478
'Cause this is where your land
of fiction gets it right.

01:33:52.645 --> 01:33:56.023
We win.
End of story.

01:35:04.714 --> 01:35:07.466
Guaranteed to jack you up.

01:35:48.592 --> 01:35:51.636
You wouldn't have
liked it here anyway.

01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.205
Stokes. Stokes.

01:36:23.249 --> 01:36:27.169
Are you... you?

01:36:28.295 --> 01:36:31.634
I think so.

01:36:31.801 --> 01:36:34.345
I hope so.

01:36:39.999 --> 01:36:41.043
Fuck!

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.899
- Shit!
- Is it over?

01:36:49.609 --> 01:36:51.444
Yeah.

01:37:03.288 --> 01:37:06.624
All right, you little fuck-pukes,
quit screwing around!

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:10.294
As you can see, life has returned
to normal at Herrington High...

01:37:10.461 --> 01:37:15.381
after the mysterious disappearance of
several faculty members one month ago.

01:37:15.548 --> 01:37:18.760
Both the local authorities and
the F.B.I. have largely discounted...

01:37:18.928 --> 01:37:22.889
several students' claim
that an extraterrestrial was involved.

01:37:23.056 --> 01:37:25.559
A spokesperson for the F.B.I.
has indicated...

01:37:25.726 --> 01:37:28.687
that no substantiating evidence
has been found.

01:37:28.853 --> 01:37:31.022
That goes for you too, Zeke!

01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:34.654
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't
mean we're gonna cut you any slack!

01:37:34.821 --> 01:37:37.156
Put that butt out
and get in there!

01:37:37.323 --> 01:37:40.158
Now bring that camera over here.

01:37:42.661 --> 01:37:44.621
When do you think they're
gonna find a new story?

01:37:44.788 --> 01:37:47.332
Haven't they milked our little
high school invasion to death?

01:37:47.499 --> 01:37:50.168
Although there has been
no evidence of foul play,

01:37:50.335 --> 01:37:52.503
the criminal investigation
is ongoing.

01:37:56.007 --> 01:37:58.342
No regrets?

01:37:58.509 --> 01:38:00.344
None whatsoever.

01:38:24.491 --> 01:38:26.117
So, how does it feel
to be a hero?

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:30.246
It's all right, I guess.

01:38:31.913 --> 01:38:33.164
I don't know, it's...

01:38:40.674 --> 01:38:43.553
- different.
- That's him over there. Hey, Casey.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.346
Your fan club's here again.

01:38:45.513 --> 01:38:47.472
Network or local?

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.601
Both.

01:38:49.768 --> 01:38:52.520
You know, you can be
pretty cool sometimes.

01:38:52.687 --> 01:38:55.898
Things sure have changed,
haven't they?
