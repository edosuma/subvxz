00:03.080 --> 00:05.834
I can't do this anymore.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.432
You are dismissed,
corporal.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.150
I've got a new girl, Lola.
She's practically a virgin.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.514
<i>The killer is Francis Maguire.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:15.434
I heard him admit
the murder meself.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.796
Please tell me
you didn't kill Phinbar.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.519
<i>The forger's a true artist.</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:22.080
Where are my plates,
O'Rourke?

00:22.080 --> 00:23.799
Them bastard cops
grabbed them,

00:23.800 --> 00:25.439
<i>along with our man Maguire.</i>

00:25.440 --> 00:27.079
First thing sunrise,

00:27.080 --> 00:29.436
We storm the precinct
and get back what's mine!

01:33.480 --> 01:35.711
Did I scare you
last night?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.791
Why would ya?

01:38.800 --> 01:41.269
I scare myself
sometimes.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.034
I get wild,
tip over,

01:44.040 --> 01:46.839
lose myself
in what I'm doing.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.275
I think
it's the gypsy in me.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.239
I have to tire myself out
to get back.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.118
Well...

01:55.440 --> 01:58.592
...I needed
a little tired.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.195
You're shaving first thing
in the morning?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.318
Yeah. So?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.357
Didn't think
you were the type

02:06.360 --> 02:09.876
to get all washed up
before work.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.031
Only after a big drink.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.033
Helps me focus,
see if I'm steady.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.792
What's your real name?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.871
What do you mean?

02:23.880 --> 02:26.076
I've been around Eva's
long enough.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.720
None of you use
your Christian names.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.080
Who says
I'm a Christian?

02:34.360 --> 02:37.512
Fine. Victoria.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.432
Come on.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.759
Honestly?
Yeah.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.989
Rose.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.275
Oh, I'm not buying that.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.477
The absolute truth?
Gloria.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.639
You win.
Lola it is.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.475
Did you send my message?

03:19.480 --> 03:20.880
Sure I did.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.870
Said he'd be right down

03:21.880 --> 03:24.111
after your audience
with Pope Pious.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.156
Now shut your mouth

03:25.160 --> 03:26.640
before ya catch yourself
another beatin',

03:26.640 --> 03:27.960
ya cop killer,
all right?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.634
You aren't seein' anyone,
and you aren't going anywhere.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.677
You're gonna stay here
and fester!

03:39.640 --> 03:42.235
I don't know. Do I have to?

03:43.920 --> 03:45.274
<i>Yes.</i>

03:45.280 --> 03:49.160
<i>Now, once more.
Are you ready?</i>

03:49.160 --> 03:50.435
Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.632
Greenbacks!
Free money!

03:58.640 --> 04:01.155
Here you're rich. You're rich!
It's all yours, fellas!

04:01.160 --> 04:04.471
There's a pot of gold!
It's the end of your rainbow!

04:04.760 --> 04:06.035
<i>Take it! And there!</i>

04:07.040 --> 04:08.440
You'll never work again
in your life!

04:09.840 --> 04:11.911
What in the good hell?!

04:12.920 --> 04:13.751
<i>Hands up!</i>

04:13.760 --> 04:15.991
<i>- Down, you coppers!
- Get back! Move!</i>

04:16.000 --> 04:18.036
<i>Get down! Kiss the floor,
you bastards!</i>

04:18.040 --> 04:19.838
<i>- Right!
- I said down!</i>

04:19.839 --> 04:20.875
You move...

04:20.880 --> 04:21.870
<i>Get down!</i>

04:21.880 --> 04:22.677
...You die!

04:24.080 --> 04:27.198
Get down, pig!
Pig, get down!

04:27.200 --> 04:29.510
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.000
- Down! Now!
- That's it, you!

04:32.000 --> 04:33.992
<i>Don't blink at me!
Don't look at me!</i>

04:34.000 --> 04:35.116
<i>Just stay still!</i>

04:35.120 --> 04:36.270
<i>Get down! Come on!</i>

04:36.280 --> 04:40.115
<i>Right. Stay where
you are. All o' ya!</i>

04:40.120 --> 04:42.077
Good morning to all!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.434
Morning it is.
But good?

04:43.440 --> 04:46.035
Good is such a small
and aspiring word.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.474
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

04:47.480 --> 04:49.358
Shut up!

04:49.360 --> 04:53.036
Mister Philomen Keating,
preeminent malefactor,

04:53.040 --> 04:57.193
currently specializing
in custom-made currency.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.395
The counterfeiter.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.119
Incarnate.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.716
And I've heard much about you,
Captain Sullivan.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.870
Now, I know
at this early hour

05:04.880 --> 05:07.759
you are understaffed
and vulnerable.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.150
So let's play nice,
shall we?

05:11.160 --> 05:14.198
I want my printing plates,
and I want them now.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.196
Lola?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.314
Gloria, Rose...

05:35.200 --> 05:39.558
It was... It is...
for the best.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.753
<i>...for both of us.</i>

05:44.320 --> 05:47.438
<i>It's like Donovan said...</i>

05:47.440 --> 05:50.672
<i>Some things only get more broke
the more you try to fix 'em.</i>

05:55.080 --> 05:57.072
If that ain't the truth.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.119
Thanks for the night.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.030
Where are my printing plates,
Captain Sullivan?

06:11.040 --> 06:12.633
<i>Find my plates!</i>

06:12.640 --> 06:13.835
Well...

06:13.840 --> 06:15.718
Why, hello.

06:16.760 --> 06:17.796
Such a beautiful couple.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.519
<i>I want me plates!</i>

06:19.520 --> 06:22.957
Please, we're only here
to report a theft.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.633
Oh...

06:25.640 --> 06:27.632
Someone has done you wrong?

06:30.920 --> 06:33.958
A frustrating feeling,
isn't it?

06:33.960 --> 06:34.950
Come here.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.231
Shh... it's okay.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.073
Stop!

06:41.080 --> 06:42.150
No!

06:42.160 --> 06:44.595
Jesus Christ!

06:44.600 --> 06:45.920
My plates?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.320
I don't know what
you're talking about!

06:47.320 --> 06:48.310
Bullshit!

06:49.480 --> 06:51.153
When I asked out there
your face fell.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.232
You knew exactly why I was here
and what I would do for them!

06:54.240 --> 06:55.833
<i>I am in a hurry!</i>

06:55.840 --> 06:57.718
<i>So do not waste my time,
Captain!</i>

06:57.720 --> 06:59.837
<i>Trust me, you don't want to see
what I am capable of</i>

06:59.840 --> 07:02.036
<i>when a situation deteriorates!</i>

07:02.040 --> 07:04.635
<i>They're here,
right here!</i>

07:04.640 --> 07:07.519
There's no need
for any more of this.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.193
<i>That drawer there?</i>

07:16.200 --> 07:18.112
No, I don't think there. no!

07:18.120 --> 07:21.272
Or there, or there...

07:26.200 --> 07:29.591
<i>...or there, or there!</i>

07:38.600 --> 07:40.910
Take the guns!
Let's move!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.313
Search everywhere!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.193
The damn drawers are empty!

07:48.200 --> 07:49.759
- Any luck?!
- No!

07:49.760 --> 07:54.039
Shit! Keep checkin'!
Shut the blinds!

07:54.040 --> 07:55.713
Where the hell
are the goddamn things?!

08:00.320 --> 08:02.312
Nothin' but goddamn papers!

08:08.600 --> 08:09.590
Anything?!

08:09.600 --> 08:11.910
Not a damn thing!
Jam the door shut!

08:20.240 --> 08:21.276
Give it.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.794
All right, all right!

08:22.800 --> 08:24.280
Can I have my clothes now?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.840
What's with
the herd of folks out front?

08:30.520 --> 08:32.078
Earn your clothes.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.312
You do know how to fire
a pistol, don't ya?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.309
Now, now...

08:39.280 --> 08:42.193
Argh! God!

08:44.760 --> 08:48.037
Nice shootin',
ya bleedin' gabbey!

08:48.040 --> 08:51.954
Next time shut your eyes.
You might actually hit the man

08:51.960 --> 08:54.794
somewhere between his balls
and his brains!

08:54.800 --> 08:57.076
What the shit,
Seamus?!

09:02.800 --> 09:05.793
How does this copper
know your name?

09:05.800 --> 09:07.200
No, I can explain.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.475
Explain what?!

09:08.480 --> 09:11.871
We gave ya the 200 coins
for blowin' in Francis Maguire.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.079
<i>And now y'gone and shot me!
Goddamn it!</i>

09:18.440 --> 09:19.476
<i>Mister O'Rourke,</i>

09:19.480 --> 09:22.234
<i>Tell me our search
has been successful!</i>

09:22.240 --> 09:24.630
No, boss, not yet!

09:25.760 --> 09:27.035
What did you expect to achieve

09:27.040 --> 09:29.794
by governing an institution
such as this?

09:29.800 --> 09:33.316
Order? Justice?

09:33.320 --> 09:35.994
This is the only order
there is,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.117
and the only justice you get
in this world

09:38.120 --> 09:39.679
is the one you can afford.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.469
But if you take justice
into your own hands,

09:43.480 --> 09:45.119
you can create your own order.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.113
I've built an empire
from order.

09:49.400 --> 09:54.111
And I will not have it
taken away from me.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.076
Where are my blessed
plates, Captain?!

10:05.520 --> 10:06.670
Get Maguire!

10:13.040 --> 10:15.032
About damn time!

10:15.040 --> 10:18.238
Seamus,
what's with the birthday suit?

10:18.240 --> 10:19.230
<i>O'Rourke.</i>

10:21.040 --> 10:23.999
I didn't expect
to see you still standin'.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.196
Takes more than a beatin'
to keep me down.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.159
What in the hell?

10:45.160 --> 10:48.710
Corky, get over here now!
Corky!

10:48.720 --> 10:49.710
Andrew, what's going on?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.040
The Druids,

10:51.040 --> 10:52.599
they took over
the precinct.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.432
They got hostages.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.079
There were several
shots fired, but...

10:56.080 --> 10:57.833
But we don't know
if any...

10:59.800 --> 11:02.076
Oh, sweet Christ.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.230
Francis.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.076
Get the hell off the street!

11:17.080 --> 11:18.070
Go! Go! Go!

11:18.080 --> 11:20.879
Go! Go! Go! Move! Go!

11:30.600 --> 11:32.637
Goddamnit!
How many are there?!

11:32.640 --> 11:34.040
I think I saw half a dozen!

11:35.200 --> 11:36.839
Sounds like more than that!

11:36.840 --> 11:38.991
That's because they're in
a building full of guns,Andrew!

11:39.000 --> 11:40.320
Our guns.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.676
<i>Cover! We need cover!</i>

11:43.440 --> 11:45.318
...<i>and as many coppers
as you can find!</i>

11:47.960 --> 11:50.520
Hold your fire there, lads!

11:50.520 --> 11:52.318
You're only making
a lotta racket!

11:52.320 --> 11:54.039
We need to save our bullets!

11:59.840 --> 12:02.150
Morning,
Mister Maguire.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.992
Where's wee Seamus?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.912
Seems our boy
was a turncoat.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.754
He's awaitin'
his sentence.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.870
A celestial circle of blue.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.031
A beautiful,
affecting sight.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.191
Oh, and here come the dregs
from the basement!

12:33.200 --> 12:34.680
Welcome! Welcome!

12:34.680 --> 12:36.672
The more the merrier
for this party!

12:38.640 --> 12:41.075
Over against the wall.
Come on!

12:41.080 --> 12:44.118
The philistine
who arrested you, is he here?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.474
Hell if I know.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.550
Now that I'm on
the other side,

12:46.560 --> 12:49.792
all coppers
look the same to me.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.557
Then let me ask you.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.279
<i>Where are my goddamn plates?</i>

12:58.920 --> 12:59.990
Hey.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.472
No one knows.
Fascinating.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.550
<i>To my knowledge,</i>

13:06.560 --> 13:09.120
<i>it is customary
that when a man is arrested...</i>

13:09.120 --> 13:13.239
...the items found on his person
are confiscated as evidence.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.836
Yet my men have searched
every room,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.393
every drawer,

13:20.400 --> 13:23.279
every goddamn locker.

13:23.280 --> 13:28.355
And there is no evidence
of Mister Maguire's arrest.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.672
Allow me to be clear:

13:43.240 --> 13:46.119
I came here in search
of possessions

13:46.120 --> 13:47.873
that belong to me.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.439
I will not leave

13:49.440 --> 13:53.275
until I have
those possessions back.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.637
You people are commodities
to me;

13:56.640 --> 14:00.475
products that I will trade
and use as needed.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.840
<i>And if someone doesn't tell me
where my possessions are,</i>

14:06.840 --> 14:09.958
you are products
that I will dispose of

14:09.960 --> 14:13.397
at my leisure.

14:25.440 --> 14:29.719
Where are they?

14:43.120 --> 14:44.156
Here!

14:51.320 --> 14:53.232
- You all armed?!
- Aye! Aye!

14:54.520 --> 14:56.079
Any sign of Sullivan?

14:56.080 --> 14:59.312
No! Can we get in touch
with Donovan?

14:59.320 --> 15:00.834
He went north last night.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.360
You two!

15:06.360 --> 15:09.637
Take the alley outside
Schwartz's pawn shop now!

15:09.640 --> 15:11.233
Right away, sir!
Come on!

15:11.240 --> 15:12.469
Hey.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.676
I need you to take
the back door! Go! Now!

15:23.040 --> 15:23.996
Detective, last night--

15:24.000 --> 15:25.514
I don't give a damn
about last night!

15:25.520 --> 15:26.715
But I found Annie.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.757
I tried to bring her home,
to your home,

15:28.760 --> 15:31.070
but your wife, Ellen,
she wouldn't have her.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.958
And Annie said
she wanted to wait for you...

15:32.960 --> 15:34.394
...here in the precinct.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.679
Hold your fire
until I say so!

15:38.680 --> 15:40.114
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

15:43.920 --> 15:46.151
<i>Goddamn it!
I said save your bullets!</i>

16:01.040 --> 16:03.760
<i>Put him there!</i>

16:03.760 --> 16:05.956
Put the captain there
with his men.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.716
I want to talk to
whoever's in charge in there!

16:58.720 --> 17:00.200
Stay down!

17:00.200 --> 17:03.159
You're gonna negotiate
with these assholes?!

17:03.160 --> 17:05.628
What other choice
do we got?

17:05.640 --> 17:09.316
I said I wanna talk!
Do you hear me?!

17:09.319 --> 17:12.358
<i>I speak not to the unknown!</i>

17:12.359 --> 17:14.875
<i>Who calls for me?</i>

17:14.880 --> 17:17.474
Detective Corcoran!

17:17.480 --> 17:20.518
What seems to be the problem,
detective?

17:20.520 --> 17:24.673
Son of a bitch
thinks he's a comedian.

17:24.680 --> 17:29.675
I'm assuming you're
not acting out of whim or caprice.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.635
So I'm curious,
what's drivin' ya?

17:32.640 --> 17:33.994
How can we help?

17:34.000 --> 17:38.040
<i>Ah, yes,
what is the inspiration</i>

17:38.040 --> 17:39.474
<i>for such an act?</i>

17:40.480 --> 17:43.393
That is your question
and it is a damn good one!

17:43.400 --> 17:46.472
<i>The spirit behind the decision
to enter this building,</i>

17:46.480 --> 17:49.473
<i>Is it a divine spirit,
you may wonder?</i>

17:49.480 --> 17:50.800
The truth?

17:52.320 --> 17:55.757
I cannot identify
between the omnipotent

17:55.760 --> 17:57.956
and the ambitions of man!

17:57.960 --> 17:59.633
<i>Can you, sir?!</i>

18:02.360 --> 18:04.352
Hello? Good sir?!

18:04.360 --> 18:07.876
Stand down!
Everyone stand down!

18:11.480 --> 18:13.711
What is it you want?
Money?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.753
Money?

18:16.760 --> 18:19.275
I have more money
than King Solomon.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.552
I want my printing plates,
Francis Maguire,

18:28.560 --> 18:31.394
and free passage
out of this city

18:31.400 --> 18:33.392
for me and my men.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.629
What printing plates?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.992
You know damn well.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.911
The plates your men stripped
from Maguire last night.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.351
What's he talking about?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.350
When we picked up Francis

18:48.360 --> 18:49.396
He was carrying
counterfeitin' plates.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.754
We processed them
like any evidence.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.514
My man here,
he was in on the arrest!

18:53.520 --> 18:55.318
He says they're in the locker!

18:59.840 --> 19:01.513
Do you suggest
I am mindless enough

19:01.520 --> 19:03.989
that I did not
look there?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.072
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:07.080 --> 19:09.037
Do you have any wounded
in there?

19:10.960 --> 19:13.236
It's a wee bit
of a mess, I'd say.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.193
Any...

19:19.800 --> 19:21.598
Any wounded children?

19:23.680 --> 19:24.670
No!

19:28.640 --> 19:30.074
Not yet.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.270
I'm still in a hopeful mood.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.397
Please don't hurt anyone else!

19:39.360 --> 19:41.477
We'll find those plates,
get you transport,

19:41.480 --> 19:45.599
whatever else you need,
but it'll take some time!

19:45.600 --> 19:47.796
Time.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.918
Time. Time.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.469
Money I can make,
but time...

19:53.480 --> 19:56.473
Until then,
can we get a doctor in there,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.039
take a look at the wounded?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.352
Are you still there?!

20:03.680 --> 20:04.875
<i>Are you there?!</i>

20:04.880 --> 20:07.679
Find my plates,
Detective!

20:11.000 --> 20:13.879
Your doctor will have
precisely 15 minutes,

20:13.880 --> 20:17.430
but I warn you,
if he's not a doctor,

20:17.440 --> 20:19.432
you'll need a mortician.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.670
Get Freeman!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.717
Yes, sir, Detective,
right away.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.360
I'll bury Maguire for bringing
this bullshit business

20:26.360 --> 20:27.794
<i>into our precinct.</i>

20:27.800 --> 20:29.678
<i>Where the hell
are those plates?!</i>

20:31.520 --> 20:33.671
<i>Pray tell.</i>

20:33.680 --> 20:36.479
Coppers at all entrances,
front and back.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.199
They got us surrounded.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.874
Well, we've got
the hostages.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.109
<i>My chips are on the table.</i>

20:42.120 --> 20:44.351
<i>I've braved harsher fires
than this.</i>

20:59.560 --> 21:00.710
Dressing and--

21:00.720 --> 21:02.473
The marine sponge and uh...

21:02.480 --> 21:03.470
Opium powder?

21:03.480 --> 21:05.039
Ah.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.030
Please.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.996
Will you be okay?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.560
Okay? No.
I'll worry myself sick.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.676
I promise,
I will--

21:13.680 --> 21:17.151
Don't say it.
Just go, do the job,

21:17.160 --> 21:18.674
and come home safe.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.670
I'll get the room
ready here

21:19.680 --> 21:22.912
in case we need to take care
of any wounded.

21:22.920 --> 21:23.910
All right.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.991
There are six men
as far as we know.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.630
Where they're stationed,
I, I can't tell ya.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.676
But I know the hostages

21:42.680 --> 21:46.356
are both coppers
and civilians.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.714
And Matthew...

21:48.960 --> 21:50.917
Annie's in there.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.640
They say they haven't hurt
any children, but--

21:53.640 --> 21:54.790
I'll look for her first,
Corky.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.350
If I had another option,
any other,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.431
I wouldn't ask you
to go in.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.432
The doctor's comin' in!

22:20.960 --> 22:23.429
<i>Keep walkin'.</i>

22:50.360 --> 22:53.831
Apologies,
can't be too cautious.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.399
Are you a real doctor,
medical doctor,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.437
or some kind of
African witch doctor

22:57.440 --> 22:58.590
with spells and such?

22:58.600 --> 23:01.195
A medical doctor,
yes.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.873
Pleased to see ya
as always,

23:02.880 --> 23:05.031
Doctor Freeman.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.555
Doctor Free-man.
Huh.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.598
Oh, you know what?
Forgot to mention one caveat.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.593
If you're not out of here
in exactly 15 minutes,

23:18.600 --> 23:21.479
beginning... now,

23:21.480 --> 23:23.278
I will kill you.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.270
Got it?!

23:31.680 --> 23:34.832
Easy. You're okay,
you're okay, hmm?

23:34.840 --> 23:38.390
<i>For the time being
he is. But I...</i>

23:38.400 --> 23:42.314
...can't make any guarantees
in regards to his future.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.596
<i>Am I gonna die?</i>

23:44.600 --> 23:46.432
No, Captain.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.430
Huh.

23:56.240 --> 24:00.757
<i>Put on the whole armor of God,</i>

24:00.760 --> 24:05.755
<i>that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.</i>

24:06.600 --> 24:10.037
For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood,

24:10.040 --> 24:13.078
but against principalities,

24:13.080 --> 24:15.879
against powers,

24:15.880 --> 24:19.920
against the rulers of darkness
of this world,

24:19.920 --> 24:24.756
<i>against spiritual wickedness
in high places.</i>

24:24.760 --> 24:28.800
<i>Wherefore take unto you
the whole armor of God</i>

24:28.800 --> 24:32.396
that ye may be able to withstand
in the evil day

24:32.400 --> 24:34.915
<i>and having done all to stand.</i>

24:38.480 --> 24:40.631
Stand therefore.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.910
Stand.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.640
Without surgery,

24:52.640 --> 24:56.190
Captain Sullivan
is sure to die and soon.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.839
With your permission,

24:57.840 --> 24:59.160
I'd like to have one
of the hostages

24:59.160 --> 25:01.436
help me carry
the wounded man out.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.430
Two for one?

25:02.440 --> 25:04.671
You are shrewder
than you look, doctor.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.716
<i>And for a smoke,</i>

25:05.720 --> 25:08.792
you've some pair of balls
on ya.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.759
You have achieved
the impossible.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.240
You have taken down
the strongest precinct

25:13.240 --> 25:14.959
in New York.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.429
And you have the power
to take lives.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.672
But you also have the power
to save lives.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.070
Allow me to help you
save this one man.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.079
Let's play a game
of democracy

25:34.080 --> 25:37.960
in the way our beloved
government declares it does!

25:39.000 --> 25:40.639
You get one vote.
The motion on the table:

25:40.640 --> 25:44.031
Do we allow the black doc
to remove Captain Sullivan

25:44.040 --> 25:45.872
from the premises?

25:45.880 --> 25:47.519
Come on now.
Vote yes,

25:47.520 --> 25:50.274
Captain Sullivan
goes to surgery.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.476
Vote no,
he remains here to die.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.914
But there's a catch.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.678
Isn't there always?

26:02.120 --> 26:04.271
A life for a life.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.316
Now, sir--

26:05.320 --> 26:06.549
Quiet, nigger.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.234
<i>If you vote to release
Captain Sullivan,</i>

26:09.240 --> 26:11.755
one of you will take his place
and die.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.877
<i>And if you vote to retain
Captain Sullivan</i>

26:13.880 --> 26:15.837
<i>and watch his life
wither away,</i>

26:15.840 --> 26:18.514
you stand a good chance
of living.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.840
Now hands up
for those who are willing

26:19.840 --> 26:22.594
to release the good captain!

26:22.600 --> 26:23.716
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

26:23.720 --> 26:25.632
<i>For those of you
with your hands tied,</i>

26:25.640 --> 26:28.075
<i>say, "Me! Me! Me!"</i>

26:29.920 --> 26:33.800
Such handsome selfishness.

26:37.400 --> 26:42.395
<i>Not a single one of you cares
about Sullivan's life?</i>

26:42.640 --> 26:45.439
This is too amusing.

26:50.640 --> 26:54.520
But I admit
I love the irony

26:54.520 --> 26:56.113
of an Irish police
captain's life

26:56.120 --> 26:58.237
in the hands
of a negro.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.998
<i>So, go ahead.</i>

27:01.000 --> 27:03.674
Get one of those useless coppers
from out there.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.320
You do understand,

27:06.320 --> 27:09.313
You've got less
than four minutes left.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.836
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick...

27:22.480 --> 27:24.472
I need a man to help me
carry out Captain Sullivan

27:24.480 --> 27:26.199
and get him to surgery
right now!

27:32.040 --> 27:33.679
I want assurances

27:33.680 --> 27:36.400
that the man coming inside
will not be harmed!

27:41.880 --> 27:43.553
Detective,

27:43.560 --> 27:48.032
I can assure you that your man
has three minutes!

27:49.720 --> 27:51.791
I need to see
what's going on in there.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.392
It's all right,
I'm comin' in.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.430
Get in here!

28:17.440 --> 28:18.430
What the hell?
Settle down!

28:18.440 --> 28:19.556
Move it! Get in there!

28:19.560 --> 28:22.553
How goes the search
for my goods?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.950
- Slowly.
- It's a shame.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.474
There's only two things
that should be done slowly,

28:26.480 --> 28:28.995
and one of them is pork,
roast pork.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.600
Why kill the innocent...

28:31.600 --> 28:33.353
...for a few pieces
of missing steel?

28:33.360 --> 28:34.350
Innocent or no,

28:34.360 --> 28:38.832
there is and always has been
only one reason to kill:

28:38.840 --> 28:40.160
Money.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.595
Why didn't the Union allow
the Confederacy to secede?

28:42.600 --> 28:44.990
Money, cotton money.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.798
And what happened next?
Killing.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.360
Hundreds of thousands dead
because of Washington's

28:49.360 --> 28:51.636
ever-ambitious empire,
Detective!

28:52.920 --> 28:54.752
They institute
a federal currency

28:54.760 --> 28:57.958
ruining states' rights,
independent banks' rights,

28:57.960 --> 29:00.953
and only one party wins:
the federal government.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.316
So if they have the right
and the power to print money,

29:03.320 --> 29:04.595
then so do I.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.080
This is madness.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.799
Well, for some of us,
madness is the only place

29:08.800 --> 29:11.110
in which
to make our fortunes.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.873
Corcoran, please!

29:14.800 --> 29:16.678
The only reason
I haven't yet shot you

29:16.680 --> 29:19.479
is because I want to see
if you and this dark doctor

29:19.480 --> 29:22.314
can carry a grown man
out of here in...

29:22.320 --> 29:23.549
Twenty-two seconds.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.951
19, 18, 17, 16, 15,

29:31.960 --> 29:36.716
<i>14, 13, 12, 11,</i>

29:36.720 --> 29:42.159
<i>ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

29:43.400 --> 29:47.997
five, four, three, two...

29:51.480 --> 29:53.312
Matthew, I didn't
see Annie in there.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.152
She's safe,
hiding in your office.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.480
They haven't found her, yet.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.549
You've got 'til
quarter past the hour

29:59.560 --> 30:01.153
to get me my plates,

30:01.160 --> 30:03.880
<i>two carriages out in front,
a clear path to the docks,</i>

30:03.880 --> 30:05.678
and an unguarded boat
waiting there!

30:05.680 --> 30:09.754
Otherwise the death toll
will rise quickly!

30:15.640 --> 30:18.394
They got two in the front,
four in the muster room.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.154
Of the hostages alive,
they got seven of our boys,

30:21.160 --> 30:22.480
eight civilians
and Annie.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.630
Which one of you's
the fastest?

30:23.640 --> 30:24.790
I won the Tammany
fourth of July race

30:24.800 --> 30:26.200
three years runnin'.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.873
There's a Norwegian
named Oma

30:27.880 --> 30:29.030
at Fatty's Saloon
on Mulberry.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.269
You'll recognize him.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.192
Say we need one large
piece of pie,

30:32.200 --> 30:33.714
and go grab me two steaks.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.712
You, go grab
the rest of our boys

30:35.720 --> 30:37.837
and bring 'em to me now! Go!

30:41.640 --> 30:43.154
All right,
you just rest now.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.555
It was bad.
Your face tells me that.

31:24.760 --> 31:29.437
I don't know why, Sara,
but there are days when...

31:32.640 --> 31:34.597
...a shadow descends upon a place,

31:34.600 --> 31:38.594
a dark, bloody pall,

31:40.280 --> 31:43.079
same as on the battlefield,
same as at the precinct today.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.436
And, oh yes,

31:46.440 --> 31:50.434
one can fight it
with all his might,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.070
but it's almost
as if the shadow

31:53.080 --> 31:55.959
needs to beat
its own self down,

31:55.960 --> 31:58.475
eat its own self
'fore it fades away and...

32:06.520 --> 32:10.753
There are days this world
makes no sense to me...

32:10.760 --> 32:12.114
...none at all.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.352
Which one of you can sing?

32:34.280 --> 32:35.316
What's your name?

32:36.880 --> 32:38.712
Felix the tenor, sir.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.349
Why is that?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.520
Because, sir, my name is Felix
and I sing tenor.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.351
Well, Felix,

32:49.360 --> 32:52.558
I want you to sing me
the saddest song you know.

32:56.400 --> 33:00.917
<i>Dear thoughts are in my mind</i>

33:02.280 --> 33:07.878
<i>And my soul soars enchanted</i>

33:08.520 --> 33:12.309
<i>As I hear the sweet larks--</i>

33:26.160 --> 33:27.230
From the Norwegian.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.594
Good. Set it down there.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.274
All right,
if he wants mayhem,

33:35.280 --> 33:36.270
let's give him mayhem.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.358
<i>What the Jesus?</i>

34:00.920 --> 34:02.912
They sent us beef!

34:06.280 --> 34:08.556
Holy shit!

34:11.960 --> 34:13.952
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

34:13.960 --> 34:14.837
Tommy, hurry!

34:17.960 --> 34:19.313
Got him!

34:21.480 --> 34:22.469
Shoot!

34:22.480 --> 34:25.791
Police! Drop
your weapons! Stay where you are!

34:26.920 --> 34:27.956
Wait! Stop!

34:27.960 --> 34:29.076
Argh!

34:29.080 --> 34:30.230
<i>Stay down!</i>

34:30.239 --> 34:31.639
Everyone stay down!

34:43.120 --> 34:46.556
Cover the stairs!

34:46.560 --> 34:47.676
Run!

34:50.000 --> 34:51.434
Agh!

35:09.800 --> 35:11.280
Agh! Agh!

35:11.280 --> 35:13.272
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

35:15.360 --> 35:17.750
Shoot once more
and I'll kill the girl!

35:17.760 --> 35:19.831
Hold your fire!
That's an order!

35:19.840 --> 35:21.513
Hold fire!

35:21.520 --> 35:23.079
Please, please,
please, please...

35:23.080 --> 35:25.720
I want all copper
weapons on the floor!

35:25.720 --> 35:27.359
Try and hold onto
a second weapon...

35:27.360 --> 35:30.159
...any other weapon,
I goddamn dare you!

35:31.320 --> 35:33.039
If one shot is fired,
she dies.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.918
Do what he says! Now!

35:34.920 --> 35:36.718
Agh! Agh! Agh!

35:36.720 --> 35:38.552
Grab 'em!

35:43.360 --> 35:46.956
It's you or the young lass,
Detective Corcoran.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.553
And I will take pleasure
in killing her.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.280
Please, Kevin! Please!
Please! Agh!

35:51.280 --> 35:53.033
Please, Kevin, please, no!

35:53.040 --> 35:54.156
You got me.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.629
Now let her go.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.280
Go on, child, go!

35:59.280 --> 36:01.237
I'm growing tired.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.551
So this is the last time
I'm gonna make this request.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.710
Ungh!

36:08.080 --> 36:09.070
Agh!

36:09.920 --> 36:11.593
I have no idea where
your plates are--

36:11.600 --> 36:12.920
It was simple!

36:14.920 --> 36:17.480
Hand over two pieces
of metal.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.120
But, no, you gotta be
the government man,

36:20.120 --> 36:21.679
the man with a badge.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.275
Well, now you die
for your sins.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.716
Wait!

36:28.320 --> 36:30.516
Mister Maguire,
What say you?

36:30.520 --> 36:32.876
Corcoran's the bastard
who sent me to swing.

36:34.280 --> 36:37.512
Would be a pleasure
to pay him back for it.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.910
Be my guest.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.389
<i>Francis!</i>

36:43.400 --> 36:44.470
Don't do this.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.199
Mind yourself,
Andrew.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.556
Been waiting a while for this,
Corky.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.351
And here's that I thought
I'd reach hell before you.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.800
But life's full of surprises,
isn't it?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.877
Slan go foill.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.473
Agh!

37:14.400 --> 37:16.756
You see, Mister Keating...

37:16.760 --> 37:19.320
A man can only climb so high...

37:19.320 --> 37:21.277
...before his ambitions
become too much

37:21.280 --> 37:22.794
and he must be taken down.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.869
The Druids are dead.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.839
But as I said...

37:31.840 --> 37:33.877
...life's full of surprises.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.599
You saved my life
when New York burnt.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.991
Now I saved yours.

38:03.800 --> 38:04.870
We're square.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.077
<i>Detective?</i>

38:25.800 --> 38:26.836
Yeah?

38:28.240 --> 38:30.835
Oh, I don't know,
it's just...

38:35.400 --> 38:37.551
...guess I never thought something
like this could happen here.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.393
Neither did I, kid.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.877
But we got our home back.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.513
<i>Why wasn't I informed?</i>

39:15.520 --> 39:17.751
Captain Sullivan wasn't even
in the know.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.594
And thank the good Lord
for that negro doctor of yours,

39:20.600 --> 39:24.276
<i>or else we would have lost
another fine man.</i>

39:24.280 --> 39:25.999
Francis went in deep.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.834
<i>He had to think like them,
act like them, smell like them.</i>

39:28.840 --> 39:30.354
He had to become one of them.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.953
<i>For chrissakes.</i>

39:31.960 --> 39:34.350
We lost innocent civilians,

39:34.360 --> 39:36.829
and several
of our own men today!

39:36.840 --> 39:39.230
And what about Phinbar?

39:39.240 --> 39:40.674
I did not kill,
little Byrnes-

39:40.680 --> 39:42.114
Casualties!

39:43.120 --> 39:44.110
You're a soldier, Corcoran.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.079
You know losses come
for the greater good.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.514
I'm gonna tell you gentlemen
something

39:48.520 --> 39:51.638
that does not leave this room.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.709
These Howard Keating
was searching for.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.880
The Union Army
is counterfeiting money,

40:04.880 --> 40:05.950
Confederate money,

40:05.960 --> 40:07.713
and flooding the South
with the bills.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.632
A flood which is destroying
what little was left

40:09.640 --> 40:11.472
of their economy.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.756
In retaliation,
the rebs wanted to do the same.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.992
We could not afford
to let that happen here!

40:17.000 --> 40:19.754
<i>When I mustered out,
the high command approached me,</i>

40:19.760 --> 40:21.592
<i>asked me to track down Keating,</i>

40:21.600 --> 40:23.956
knowing full well he had been
hired by the Confederacy

40:23.960 --> 40:25.519
to strike New York.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.513
The assignment:
Put him out of business.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.672
So...

40:33.680 --> 40:36.354
...money over lives,
is it?

40:36.360 --> 40:37.874
<i>It's reality, Detective.</i>

40:37.880 --> 40:39.678
The dirty little side
of the war

40:39.680 --> 40:41.433
that gains no headlines,

40:41.440 --> 40:42.954
earns no commendations.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.429
And in that skirmish,

40:45.440 --> 40:47.159
<i>Francis Maguire
was a valiant soldier.</i>

40:47.160 --> 40:49.720
He was in the precinct
the entire time,

40:49.720 --> 40:50.710
gun in hand,

40:50.720 --> 40:52.393
and did nothing
to stop Keating's slaughter!

40:52.400 --> 40:54.073
I was in holding
half the time!

40:56.560 --> 40:57.596
If I'd'a fired on 'em,

40:57.600 --> 40:58.590
it would have been
the death of me

40:58.600 --> 40:59.875
and the investigation!

40:59.880 --> 41:02.349
I need to know,
Francis...

41:04.600 --> 41:05.829
Who killed Phinbar?

41:07.400 --> 41:09.073
James O'Rourke.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.594
And today, Corky,
thanks to you,

41:13.600 --> 41:15.831
the murderin' bastard
got his.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.593
Lads, enough!

41:22.840 --> 41:25.116
Detective Maguire.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.429
Now look, I understand
some serious shit

41:29.440 --> 41:31.557
has gone down
between the two of ye.

41:32.840 --> 41:33.990
<i>Moving forward,</i>

41:34.000 --> 41:38.438
<i>you two will work for me,
together...</i>

41:38.440 --> 41:39.760
...like it or not.

41:47.480 --> 41:48.630
To what's to be.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.757
Shake the man's hand,
Detective.
