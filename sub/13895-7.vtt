WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.330
&lt;♪♪&gt;

00:03.370 --> 00:07.300
[JAKE] YOU JUST GOTTA THINK
ABOUT IT, I MEAN LOOK AROUND.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.880
HOW MUCH LUCK HAS THAT THING
BROUGHT YOU?

00:08.920 --> 00:12.010
[SHAMROCK] YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN MY SITUATION
BEFORE I HAD THE TATTOO.

00:12.050 --> 00:14.800
[JAKE] MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO STOP RELYING ON LUCK.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.800
[SHAMROCK] YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.600
[JAKE] IT COMES DOWN TO
COMMUNICATION BUD--

00:17.640 --> 00:19.270
[BUMPY MIKE] YEAH, YOU TRY
COMMUNICATING WITH HIM.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.770
[SHAMROCK] YEAH I ALREADY TOLD
YOU, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

00:20.810 --> 00:22.270
[JAKE] HEY! HEY!

00:22.310 --> 00:23.390
SHAMROCK...

00:23.440 --> 00:26.150
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU TRULY WANT?

00:26.190 --> 00:30.030
[SHAMROCK] JUST WHAT I ALWAYS
HAD, JAKE... AIRPORT HEIGHTS.

00:30.070 --> 00:34.070
[JAKE] NOW WOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO PART WITH EVERYTHING
BELLOW PIPPY PARK?

00:34.110 --> 00:36.830
I MEAN, IN THE SPIRIT OF MOVING
THIS THING FORWARD?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.410
[LESLIE] DOYLE,
YOU READY TO GO? OR
SHOULD I COME BACK ANOTHER TIME?

00:39.450 --> 00:41.450
[JAKE] JUST GIVE ME
2 SECONDS CONSTABLE.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.370
[LESLIE] OKAY.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.040
[SHAMROCK] FINE. YES.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.210
[JAKE] BUMPY, SATISFIED?

00:47.250 --> 00:48.750
GOOD. SHAKE ON IT.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.170
C'MON.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.090
GOOD JOB FELLAS, GOOD JOB.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.010
WAS THAT SO HARD?

00:54.050 --> 00:55.260
REALLY?

00:55.300 --> 00:56.590
[JAKE] HI THERE.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.300
[LESLIE] THE CROWN ATTORNEY
DROPPED ALL CHARGES.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.640
YEAH HE SAID THE CASE WAS WEAK.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.430
HE DIDN'T WANNA WASTE ANY
MORE TIME ON YOU.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.270
[JAKE] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

01:03.310 --> 01:04.730
MAYBE THAT THING DOES
BRING LUCK.

01:04.770 --> 01:06.270
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

01:06.310 --> 01:09.070
&lt;♪♪&gt;

01:13.280 --> 01:15.280
[JAKE] FREE AT LAST.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.240
[JAKE] IF THERE WAS ACTUALLY
HEATED TOILET SEATS,

01:21.290 --> 01:24.120
THE ENTIRE PRISON POPULATION
WOULD BE RENDERED DOCILE,
YOU KNOW.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.880
AND I CHANGED, I GOT HARD
IN THERE, OLD MAN.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.460
AT ONE POINT I HAD TO TAKE
A SPOON, LIKE A PLASTIC SPOON,

01:29.500 --> 01:33.340
I FILED IT DOWN, I STABBED
THIS GUY, IN THE UH...

01:33.380 --> 01:37.390
[MALACHY] CHEERS DARLING.
[JAKE] WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

01:39.890 --> 01:41.890
LOOK IF YOU TOLD ME THAT WE
WERE GONNA BE HERE,

01:41.930 --> 01:44.230
I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST YOU
KNOW, PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.310
[MALACHY] IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GROW UP JAKE.
[JAKE] OH YEAH.

01:47.350 --> 01:50.150
[MALACHY] YOU CAN'T KEEP
GETTING YOUR ARSE HAULED OFF
TO JAIL EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY.

01:50.190 --> 01:51.650
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

01:51.690 --> 01:53.690
[JAKE] YOU KNOW THAT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

01:53.740 --> 01:54.650
[MALACHY] SURE.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.490
IT WAS A GIRL THIS TIME,
WASN'T IT?

01:56.530 --> 01:57.700
IT'S ALWAYS A GIRL.

01:57.740 --> 01:59.780
A WIFE YOU CAN'T QUITE DIVORCE.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.410
A PRETTY COP YOU STRING ALONG.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.870
[JAKE] WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

02:02.910 --> 02:04.250
DID YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR
MEDS OR SOMETHING TODAY?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.710
[MALACHY] JUST BECAUSE YOUR
MOTHER DIED WHEN SHE DID,

02:05.750 --> 02:08.000
DOESN'T GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE TO
ACT THE WAY YOU DO!

02:08.040 --> 02:09.170
[JAKE] WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

02:09.210 --> 02:10.710
[MALACHY] YOU'RE A CHILD JAKE.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.500
STILL RUNNING AROUND LIKE A
DAMN 14 YEAR OLD. FROM NOW ON

02:12.550 --> 02:16.090
I DEAL WITH NO MORE CRAP FROM
YOU. NO MORE NIGHTS IN JAIL,

02:16.130 --> 02:18.260
NO MORE STUPID DRUNKEN
BAR FIGHTS.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.050
NO MORE WOMEN!

02:21.100 --> 02:24.100
[JANE DOE] &lt;COUGHING&gt;

02:27.770 --> 02:29.150
[MALACHY] WHAT?

02:33.150 --> 02:35.360
[JAKE] ARE YOU OKAY?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.150
[JANE DOE] I THINK
I NEED YOUR HELP.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.120
&lt;♪♪&gt;

02:46.370 --> 02:49.330
♪OH YEAH
(OH YEAH)♪

02:49.370 --> 02:52.420
♪OH YEAH
(OH YEAH)♪

02:52.460 --> 02:58.300
♪OH YEEAAH
OH YEEAAH♪

02:58.340 --> 03:00.390
♪OH YEAH♪

03:00.430 --> 03:03.180
&lt;♪♪&gt;

03:04.310 --> 03:08.520
[JANE DOE] I HAVE NO IDEA WHO I
AM. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.560
I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE I CAME
FROM, HOW I GOT HERE.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.570
[NIKKI] THE SCANS DON'T
SHOW ANY LOCAL CONTUSIONS
OR HEMORRHAGING.

03:16.610 --> 03:19.200
BUT THE AMNESIA COULD BE THE
RESULT OF CEREBRAL SWELLING

03:19.240 --> 03:21.360
WHICH MIGHT BE
HARD TO DETECT ON A SCAN.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.280
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE
BLOW TO YOUR HEAD?

03:23.320 --> 03:28.790
[JANE DOE] NO. NO IT WAS LIKE
I CAME TO FROM A TRANCE.

03:28.830 --> 03:32.420
I WOKE UP AND I WAS JUST THERE.
I WAS LOST.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.380
[JAKE] HOW LONG WILL IT
BE BEFORE SHE STARTS TO
REMEMBER THINGS?

03:34.420 --> 03:35.550
[NIKKI] GIVE IT TIME.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.420
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO JOG
THE MEMORY.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.300
I WILL FIT YOU IN WITH THE
NEUROLOGIST.

03:39.340 --> 03:41.760
AND IN THE MEAN TIME...

03:41.800 --> 03:44.390
THE POLICE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE?

03:44.430 --> 03:47.890
[LESLIE] HI, I'M CONSTABLE
BENNETT.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.930
[JANE DOE] HI.
[LESLIE] MR. DOYLE.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.640
[JAKE] CONSTABLE.
[NIKKI] CONSTABLE.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.850
[LESLIE] DOCTOR.
[JAKE] DOCTOR.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.570
[MALACHY] CONSTABLE.
[NIKKI] GOOD LUCK.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.440
[JANE DOE] THANK YOU.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.900
[LESLIE] I'VE ALREADY CHECKED
WITH MISSING PERSONS,
BUT THERE'S NO MATCH YET.

04:00.950 --> 04:05.370
I'LL TAKE YOUR PHOTO AND
YOUR PRINTS AND SEE IF ANYTHING
COMES UP IN THE SYSTEM.

04:05.410 --> 04:08.910
[JANE DOE] FOR NOW,
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:08.950 --> 04:11.750
[LESLIE] I WOULD SUGGEST
RETRACING YOUR STEPS.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.420
SEE IF ANYTHING COMES
BACK TO YOU.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.830
[JANE DOE] ON MY OWN?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.630
[JAKE] WE'RE SORT OF EXPERTS
WHEN IT COMES TO MISSING

04:16.670 --> 04:19.460
PERSONS, AND YOU ARE-- I MEAN,
TECHNICALLY-- NOT REALLY--

04:19.510 --> 04:21.840
I MEAN YOU'RE HERE BUT YOU'RE
KIND OF LIKE A MISSING PERSON.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.890
[MALACHY] WHAT HE'S
TRYING TO SAY IS, WE'RE
PRIVATE DETECTIVES.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.890
[JAKE] YEAH, WE'RE PRIVATE
DETECTIVES.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.140
[JANE DOE] OH...

04:27.680 --> 04:29.180
OKAY.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.430
[LESLIE] THE DOYLE'S HAVE BEEN
KNOWN TO SOLVE A MYSTERY OR

04:31.480 --> 04:32.850
TWO...

04:33.770 --> 04:35.020
FROM TIME TO TIME.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.100
[JAKE] YEAH, TRY IT.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.610
WE'RE GOOD AND WE'RE CHEAP
AND EASY.

04:38.650 --> 04:41.650
[JANE DOE] OKAY, YOU'RE HIRED.
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.820
IT'S A DEAL.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.120
[LESLIE] I JUST NEED A
STATEMENT FROM YOU?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.290
[JAKE] OH RIGHT.
I GUESS WE SHOULD

04:50.330 --> 04:52.330
PROBABLY LEAVE YOU
GUYS TO DO YOUR STATEMENT.

04:56.920 --> 05:01.090
[MALACHY] JUST PLAYING
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, BUT AMNESIA?

05:01.130 --> 05:02.460
[JAKE] YEAH OKAY.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.510
IT DEFINITELY YOU KNOW SOUNDS
A LITTLE IMPROBABLE.

05:04.550 --> 05:05.890
A LITTLE WEIRD FOR SURE.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.890
BUT IF SHE'S FAKING IT
I DON'T SEE THE ANGLE.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.430
[MALACHY] YOU BETTER BE MAKING
THIS CALL WITH YOUR HEAD,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.850
NOT SOME OTHER PART
OF YOUR ANATOMY.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.820
[JAKE] ALRIGHT SERIOUSLY, WHAT
THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

05:20.860 --> 05:23.490
[JAKE] SO WHAT NAME DO YOU
WANNA BE CALLED?

05:23.530 --> 05:27.320
[JANE DOE] WELL, I'D LIKE TO BE
CALLED BY MY REAL NAME.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.370
[DES] AMNESIA VICTIMS
STILL HAVE ALL THEIR
MUSCLE MEMORY AND THAT.

05:31.410 --> 05:33.370
HERE YOU SHOULD TRY-- HERE.

05:33.410 --> 05:35.620
TRY WRITING A NAME,
AND JUST SEE WHAT COMES OUT.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.170
LIKE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

05:37.210 --> 05:38.380
[JAKE] WHERE DID YOU PULL
THAT FROM?

05:38.420 --> 05:41.500
[DES] FROM AFTERNOONS
WATCHING SOAPS WITH MY NAN.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.340
HERE, JUST TRY IT.

05:43.380 --> 05:46.760
[JAKE] I MEAN, IT'S
WORTH A SHOT RIGHT?

05:55.180 --> 05:56.390
[JAKE/DES] "CHELSEA".

05:56.440 --> 05:58.100
[JAKE] THAT ONE LOOKS
LIKE "BRUCE".

05:58.150 --> 06:00.520
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A BRU--
SORRY.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.530
[JAKE] "MEGHAN".

06:02.570 --> 06:04.190
[DES] YEAH, MEGHAN.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.320
[JAKE] UM...

06:06.360 --> 06:07.450
[DES] "CHAR".

06:07.490 --> 06:08.110
[JAKE] "CHARMAINE".
[DES] "CHARMAINE".

06:08.160 --> 06:09.490
I GOT A COUSIN NAMED CHARMAINE.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.910
[JAKE] SHUT UP DES.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.830
"ANNABELLE".
[JANE DOE] UGH!

06:13.870 --> 06:16.120
[JAKE] NO IT'S OKAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?

06:16.160 --> 06:19.170
IT WAS DES' IDEA AND HE'S LIKE
NINE-TENTH'S RETARD, SO...

06:20.500 --> 06:22.670
[JANE DOE] YEAH, JUST FORGET IT.
[JAKE] DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.760
JUST-- DES... OUT.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.300
GO ON. BEAT IT. GO ON. LEAVE.

06:27.340 --> 06:31.760
NOW. GO. STOP--
NEW IDEA,

06:31.800 --> 06:33.100
ALRIGHT?

06:33.140 --> 06:35.060
WE GO TO THE GRAVEYARD AND SEE
WHAT WE CAN FIND.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.310
MAYBE SOMETHING WILL JOG
YOUR MEMORY.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.480
[JANE DOE] OKAY.
[JAKE] SOUND GOOD?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.730
[JANE DOE] YEAH.
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, C'MON.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.650
[ROSE] MAL, WAIT. HUN?
[MALACHY] SORRY,

06:43.690 --> 06:44.860
I GOTTA HEAD OUT.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.360
[ROSE] WHEN ARE WE GONNA TALK?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.200
CAN'T KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.820
[MALACHY] DON'T BE FOOLISH,
I'M FINE AND THERE'S
NOTHING TO PUT OFF.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.700
[ROSE] MAL, I'M MARRIED.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

06:51.740 --> 06:55.580
[MALACHY] PAST IS PAST,
AND I TRUST YOU TO SORT OUT
EVERYTHING IN THE PRESENT.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.620
[ROSE] REALLY?

06:58.660 --> 06:59.920
[MALACHY] YEAH, REALLY.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.790
NOW I GOTTA GET GOING.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.040
[ROSE] OKAY.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.380
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.420
[TOM] EXCUSE ME DOCTOR?
[NIKKI] YES?

07:08.470 --> 07:09.680
ONE SECOND PLEASE.
YES?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.640
[TOM] I'M LOOKING FOR MY
GIRLFRIEND. UM, THEY SAID ON

07:11.680 --> 07:13.800
THE PHONE YOU HAD A JANE DOE?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.890
I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT COULD BE HER.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.180
I HOPE IT'S HER.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.230
DID YOU TREAT A WOMAN IN A RED
DRESS THIS MORNING?

07:19.270 --> 07:21.270
[NIKKI] YOU MUST BE
VERY WORRIED.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.190
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:22.230 --> 07:24.440
[TOM] WE HAD A LITTLE
DISAGREEMENT AND

07:24.480 --> 07:28.650
SHE WENT FOR A WALK TO COOL OFF,
AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK
TO THE HOTEL ROOM.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.320
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS JANE DOE IS RIGHT NOW?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.660
[NIKKI] I REALLY CAN'T GIVE
OUT PATIENT INFORMATION.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.620
BUT IF YOU CALL THE POLICE
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO
HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

07:35.660 --> 07:38.290
[TOM] RIGHT, THANK YOU.
[NIKKI] YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.630
[TOM] HI.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.710
[VOLUNTEER] HI.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, DEAR?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.670
[TOM] WELL, MY LITTLE SISTER...

07:48.710 --> 07:50.050
SHE WENT OUT WITH
HER BOYFRIEND LAST NIGHT,

07:50.090 --> 07:51.680
AND THEY GOT INTO
A LITTLE TUSSLE,

07:51.720 --> 07:53.050
AND SHE NEVER MADE IT
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.430
[VOLUNTEER] OH MY.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.810
[TOM] ON THE PHONE THEY SAID
A JANE DOE HAD COME IN?

07:56.850 --> 07:59.560
BUT NOBODY SEEMS
TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.640
[VOLUNTEER] OH, YES.
I REMEMBER HER.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.020
SHE CAME IN WITH
NO NAME OR ANY I.D.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.570
THE ONLY THING SHE HAD WITH HER
WAS JAKE AND MALACHY DOYLE.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.610
[TOM] IS THAT SO?
AND WHO MIGHT THEY BE?

08:08.280 --> 08:11.280
[JANE DOE] I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG I WAS WALKING FOR
BEFORE I CAME TO.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.990
WHAT WERE THE TWO OF YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

08:17.030 --> 08:20.870
[JAKE] OH, JUST MY DAD
AND I WE WERE HERE TO
SEE MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.

08:20.910 --> 08:22.370
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS A KID.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.040
[JANE DOE] OH SORRY.
[JAKE] YEAH.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.750
LISTEN, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, OKAY?

08:27.800 --> 08:31.720
WHO WAS THE FIRST ASTRONAUT
TO LAND ON MARS?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.720
[JANE DOE] NO ONE HAS EVER
LANDED ON MARS.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.550
I DO HAVE SOME WORKING
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.600
[JAKE] SORRY.
[JANE DOE] ARE YOU TESTING ME?

08:39.640 --> 08:44.650
YOU WORK FOR ME, REMEMBER?
[JAKE] YES I DO.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.940
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

08:51.980 --> 08:55.320
THINK THIS WOULD MATCH THAT
PRETTY LITTLE DRESS YOU HAD ON?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.370
[JANE DOE] IT COULD.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.040
[JAKE] YOU GOT NO DRIVER'S
LICENSE, NO I.D.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.620
[JANE DOE] SO I WAS ROBBED?

09:03.660 --> 09:05.630
[JAKE] MAYBE SOMEBODY HIT YOU
OVER THE HEAD AND ROBBED YOU?

09:05.670 --> 09:08.750
IT'S POSSIBLE.
[JANE DOE] BUT WHAT WAS I DOING
OUT HERE BY MYSELF?

09:08.790 --> 09:10.550
[JAKE] THAT'S THE MYSTERY
ISN'T IT?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.550
[JANE DOE] THERE'S A TICKET.
[JAKE] LET ME SEE THAT.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.180
IT'S A COAT CHECK TICKET.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.220
QUESTION IS, WHERE IS IT FROM?

09:25.560 --> 09:28.310
[MALACHY] WOW,
YOU'VE AGED POORLY.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.360
[EX-COP] B'Y, FORCED EARLY
RETIREMENT DOES TAKE A TOLL.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.280
[MALACHY] GLAD TO KEEP YOU
BUSY THEN.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.530
[EX-COP] MARTIN POOLE.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.700
LOVELY MAN THIS FRIEND OF
YOURS.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.120
[MALACHY] HE'S NO FRIEND
OF MINE.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.700
[EX-COP] THAT'S A GOOD THING.

09:39.740 --> 09:43.120
HIS FORMATIVE YEARS CONSIST OF
A DELIGHTFUL MIX OF ADDICTION,

09:43.160 --> 09:45.790
PETTY THEFT,
SMALL TIME DOPE DEALING.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.710
[MALACHY] GRADUATED TO
TRAFFICKING THE HARDER STUFF,
I SEE.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.880
[EX-COP] YES SIR.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.670
HE WAS BUSTED WITH A CARGO
CONTAINER OF HEROIN AND LOCKED
UP FOR A GOOD LONG STRETCH.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.760
[MALACHY] WELL, HE'S OUT NOW.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.760
[EX-COP] COME LOOKING FOR
HIS WIFE NOW, IS HE?

09:58.800 --> 10:01.760
[MALACHY] WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT HIS WIFE?

10:01.810 --> 10:04.810
[EX-COP] THIS ONE,
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO LOOK AT.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.650
[MALACHY] OH &lt;SIGHS&gt;.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.450
[ROSE] HEY, HAVE YOU EAT
ANYTHING TODAY?

10:23.490 --> 10:25.330
OR ARE YOU ON A HUNGER STRIKE?

10:25.370 --> 10:30.250
[TINNY] I'M FINE.
[ROSE] WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

10:30.290 --> 10:32.170
DID WAYNE BREAK UP WITH YOU
OR SOMETHING?

10:32.210 --> 10:34.510
[TINNY] IT'S "DWAYNE".

10:34.550 --> 10:36.050
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

10:36.090 --> 10:40.640
[ROSE] HOW COME?
[TINNY] BECAUSE HE'S A LOSER.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.850
[ROSE] C'MON, I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME LUNCH.

10:42.890 --> 10:44.100
WE'RE GONNA TALK IT OUT.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.770
I KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF.

10:46.810 --> 10:50.230
[TINNY] I THOUGHT I LIKED
DWAYNE. I THINK I JUST LIKED
HIS APARTMENT.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.230
[ROSE] YOU WANTED A TICKET
OUTTA HERE, I GET IT.

10:52.270 --> 10:53.520
[TINNY] YEAH.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.230
[ROSE] BUT YOU DON'T NEED
A MAN TO RESCUE YOU.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.780
YOU SHOULDN'T NEED A MAN
FOR ANYTHING.

10:56.820 --> 10:57.740
[TINNY] I KNOW THAT!

10:57.780 --> 10:59.240
[ROSE] OKAY, CHILL OUT, OKAY?

10:59.280 --> 11:01.780
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I WAS JUST
AS STUPID AS YOU ARE.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.660
TINNY, THESE MEN CAN YELL AT
EACH OTHER ALL DAY LONG AND

11:04.700 --> 11:06.000
PUNCH EACH OTHER IN THE HEAD.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.250
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY
ALL GO FOR A BEER AT THE PUB.

11:09.290 --> 11:15.710
AND WELL,
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS
WHY CAN'T YOU AND I GET ALONG?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.420
[TINNY] YOU WANNA GO FOR
A BEER WITH ME?

11:17.470 --> 11:19.840
[ROSE] NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.
[TINNY] WELL WHAT THEN?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.850
[ROSE] YOU AND I MIGHT
NEVER BE FRIENDS.
BUT THERE IS NO POINT IN

11:23.890 --> 11:26.850
WASTING OUR ENERGY
WEARING EACH OTHER DOWN.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.480
WE NEED TO CONSERVE IT
TO DEAL WITH THE MEN,

11:29.520 --> 11:32.230
YOU KNOW? TRUST ME.

11:32.270 --> 11:33.900
[TINNY] I DO...

11:34.770 --> 11:36.150
TRUST YOU.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.950
[ROSE] WANT SOME TEA?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.990
COULD USE A NICE HOT CUP.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.460
[TINNY] &lt;HEAVY BREATHING&gt;
ARE THERE NUTS IN THIS?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.130
&lt;COUGHING&gt;
[ROSE] HUH?

11:56.170 --> 11:57.090
I-- I-- I DON'T KNOW HONEY.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.840
[TINNY] ROSE,
I CAN'T HAVE NUTS.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.300
&lt;HEAVY BREATHING&gt;
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

12:01.340 --> 12:03.470
[ROSE] OH MY GOD TINNY,
I FORGOT!

12:03.510 --> 12:04.260
OH, I'LL GET YOUR EPIPEN!

12:04.300 --> 12:05.930
JUST WAIT!

12:08.220 --> 12:09.850
[JAKE] THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE
OF RESTAURANTS IN TOWN THAT

12:09.890 --> 12:13.020
THAT TICKET CAN BELONG TO.
&lt;CAR HORN HONKING&gt;

12:13.060 --> 12:15.310
[JANE DOE] DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY
WILL REMEMBER ME?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.360

12:25.990 --> 12:27.120
I SENT HIM TO THE COPS.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.790

12:28.830 --> 12:31.580
[NIKKI] NO. BUT HE WAS TALL AND
HANDSOME. THEY SHOULD SEE HIM

12:31.620 --> 12:34.330
ANY MINUTE. YOU CAN ALWAYS
CALL YOUR LITTLE COP FRIEND.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.420

12:59.860 --> 13:00.570

13:03.780 --> 13:05.110

I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
GIVE ME YOUR EXPERT OPINION
ON THE WHOLE THING?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.870
[NIKKI] IT'S NOT
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.090
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT COMPLETE
RETROGRADE AMNESIA IS VERY RARE,

14:42.130 --> 14:43.340
LIKE EXTREMELY RARE.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.010
[JAKE] SEE THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW?

14:45.050 --> 14:47.090
[NIKKI] NOT TO MENTION,
THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD,

14:47.130 --> 14:49.840

HARDEST TO FORGET.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.430
[JAKE] RIGHT.
[NIKKI] BUT HEY,

14:51.470 --> 14:52.640
THE BRAIN IS A STRANGE PLACE.

14:54.770 --> 14:59.270
[JAKE] ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
[NIKKI] OKAY, IT'S TIME TO GO.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.160
[JANE DOE] WHAT?

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
[JAKE] LOOK, I'VE HAD SOME
PRETTY BAD LUCK IN MY LIFE

BELIEVE ME AND,

15:58.200 --> 16:03.130
I KNOW WHEN I'M BEING SET UP,
AND I'M KIND OF GETTING
THAT FEELING RIGHT NOW.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.170
[JANE DOE] WHO'S SETTING YOU UP?

16:07.170 --> 16:09.260
[JAKE] THE RED HEADED GUY THAT
JUMPED YOU.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.380
HE CALLED YOU "ANNABELLE".

16:12.430 --> 16:14.800
YEAH, ANNABELLE.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.560
IT'S ONE OF THE NAMES YOU WROTE
DOWN ON THE PIECE OF PAPER.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.180
[JANE DOE] WELL,
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.230
[JAKE] RIGHT.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.770
THIS GUY, HE WASN'T VERY POLITE
YOU KNOW?

16:22.810 --> 16:26.520
IN THAT KINDA LIKE MURDEROUS
AND PSYCHOPATHIC KINDA
NOT POLITE WAY.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.900
AND YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.440
I DON'T KNOW WHAT,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

16:29.490 --> 16:35.820
BUT I'M 90... 20 PERCENT SURE
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

16:35.870 --> 16:40.200
[JANE DOE] I CAN'T HIDE
ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT I COULD BE HIDING.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.580
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT LIFE HERE.

16:42.620 --> 16:47.590

A GREAT FAMILY, PROBABLY
A HANDFUL OF GORGEOUS WOMEN

16:47.630 --> 16:52.220
YOU'RE JUGGLING.
JUST IMAGINE OF
THAT WAS WIPED CLEAN?

16:52.260 --> 16:55.010
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM,
I DON'T KNOW WHO ANYBODY IS.

16:55.050 --> 16:59.430
BUT I WENT WITH MY GUT AND
I PUT MY FAITH IN ONE PERSON...

17:01.680 --> 17:02.890

SO IF YOU THINK THAT
I'M FAKING ALL THIS..

17:09.150 --> 17:11.400
YOU KNOW, SCREW IT.
I'M BETTER OFF ON MY OWN.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.070
[JAKE] WAIT.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.410
I'M SORRY.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.710

17:35.260 --> 17:37.260

IT'S NOT DUE TILL...

18:28.850 --> 18:30.060

18:41.490 --> 18:44.040
YOU AND I,
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR
FOUR MONTHS RIGHT?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.290
[DR. COLLINS] DID I FORGET
AN ANNIVERSARY?

18:45.330 --> 18:46.580
[NIKKI] NO!

18:46.620 --> 18:47.660
NO YOU DIDN'T!

18:47.710 --> 18:49.330
DO YOU EVER GET PISSED OFF?

18:49.370 --> 18:52.380
[DR. COLLINS] SORRY?
[NIKKI] DO YOU EVER GET
PISSED OFF?!

18:52.420 --> 18:53.920
[DR. COLLINS] WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GET PISSED OFF?

18:53.960 --> 18:57.970
[NIKKI] YES!--
NO-- NO I--

19:04.770 --> 19:06.310
[DR. COLLINS] HOW WAS THAT?

19:06.350 --> 19:08.020
[NIKKI] RIGHT.

19:08.060 --> 19:11.060
I-- I BETTER GET BACK.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.190
[DR. COLLINS] NIKKI.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.450
[COAT CHECK GIRL] OH SURE.

19:22.490 --> 19:25.330
YEAH, I REMEMBER YOU FROM
LAST NIGHT.

19:25.370 --> 19:29.210
I WAS KINDA HOPING YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO RECLAIM THIS.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.380
[JAKE] WAS SHE HERE WITH
ANYBODY?

19:31.420 --> 19:34.380
[COAT CHECK GIRL] NO.
SAT IN THE CORNER WITH
A HALF LITRE OF WINE.

19:34.420 --> 19:37.260
[JAKE] BY HERSELF?
[COAT CHECK GIRL] SOME GUY
CAME IN EVENTUALLY.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.090
HE CAME IN THROUGH THE BACK.
HE WAS A BIT...

19:40.130 --> 19:42.550
[JAKE] OF A CREEPY RED HEADED
LOOKING FELLA?

19:42.590 --> 19:44.850
[COAT CHECK GIRL] I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS?

19:44.890 --> 19:46.930
[JANE DOE] DID YOU HAPPEN TO
HEAR ANYTHING WE SAID?

19:46.970 --> 19:48.220
[COAT CHECK GIRL] NOT REALLY.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.640
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
HAVING AN ARGUMENT

19:49.690 --> 19:52.690
AND THEN THE TWO OF YOU
JUST GOT UP AND LEFT.

19:54.060 --> 19:58.860
[JANE DOE] WHAT'S THIS?
[JAKE] WELL...

19:58.900 --> 20:00.780
IF THIS IS YOUR CAR,

20:00.820 --> 20:03.820
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN PAY ME.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.620
[JANE DOE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:06.660 --> 20:08.290
[JAKE] I'M UH...

20:09.830 --> 20:12.460
HUNTING A JAGUAR, THIS WAY.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.420
&lt;CAR DOOR UNLOCKS&gt;
[JAKE] WELL...

20:16.460 --> 20:18.460
IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOU HAVE TASTE.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.420
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:19.460 --> 20:22.430
YOU WANNA GET IN?
HAVE A SEAT, SEE HOW IT FEELS?

20:22.470 --> 20:24.220
[JANE DOE] CAN'T HURT.

20:26.470 --> 20:28.850
[JAKE] THESE MIGHT
COME IN HANDY.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.730
WOW, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:37.770 --> 20:41.400
COULD YOU MAYBE SEE YOURSELF
OWNING THIS CAR?

20:42.530 --> 20:44.660
[JANE DOE] I DON'T KNOW.
[JAKE] WELL, THESE TICKETS

20:44.700 --> 20:48.700
WILL TELL US SOMETHING.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.330
AND SO WILL THIS.

20:51.370 --> 20:55.380
[GPS] LAST ADDRESS:
495 OLD BROAD COVE ROAD.

20:55.420 --> 21:01.880
DRIVE .2 KILOMETERS
THEN TURN LEFT.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.550
[JAKE] I'LL FOLLOW YOU
IN MY CAR.

21:03.590 --> 21:06.470
[JANE DOE] OKAY.
[JAKE] DO YOU THINK YOU CAN

21:06.510 --> 21:08.600
STILL REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE?
[JANE DOE] I'LL DO MY BEST.

21:08.640 --> 21:12.770
[JAKE] I'LL TRY AND KEEP UP.
[ROSE] THINK YOU LEFT

21:12.810 --> 21:15.310
SOMETHING IN MY TEAPOT.
[MARTIN] OH YEAH,

21:15.350 --> 21:16.900
IS THAT WHERE I LEFT IT?

21:16.940 --> 21:19.360
[ROSE] YOU'RE LUCKY IT WAS ME
THAT FOUND IT, NOT MALACHY.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.530
[MARTIN] OH YEAH?

21:20.570 --> 21:22.780
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THEN,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW?

21:22.820 --> 21:28.080
[ROSE] THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND YOU. AND I WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.080
[MARTIN] IS THAT SO?

21:30.120 --> 21:33.000
AND WHY ARE SITTING HERE NEXT
TO ME LOOKING SO GOOD.

21:33.040 --> 21:37.290
YOU GOT YOURSELF ALL FIXED UP
AND EVERYTHING JUST TO
COME OVER HERE, WHAT?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.460
[ROSE] I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU,
TO KEEP OUT OF MY TEAPOT.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.670
[MARTIN] OH, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T BE IN A HURRY.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.970
I GOT SOMETHING I WANT
TO SHOW YOU.

21:44.010 --> 21:45.380
GOT A MINUTE?

21:49.050 --> 21:51.140
[ROSE] WHATEVER, SO WHAT?
[MARTIN] "WHATEVER, SO WHAT?"

21:51.180 --> 21:52.520
I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY
SCROLLED AWAY--

21:52.560 --> 21:54.430
[ROSE] OH YEAH?
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, HUH?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.310
[MARTIN] SO I'M GONNA DO IT.

21:56.350 --> 22:00.230
LIKE I ALWAYS SAID,
"SAIL DOWN TO THE CARIBBEAN"
AND WHATEVER.

22:00.270 --> 22:03.320
I GOT A LOT OF LOST TIME
TO MAKE UP FOR.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.280
A LOT OF IT.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
YOU SHOULD COME ALONG.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.070
[ROSE] REALLY?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.370
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.240
[MARTIN] CRAZY?

22:11.280 --> 22:14.290
AS I REMEMBER
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU LIKE.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.750
[ROSE] DON'T YOU EVER
DO THAT AGAIN.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.800
[MARTIN] MY MISTAKE.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.970
ROSIE.

22:51.450 --> 22:53.700

23:31.070 --> 23:32.490

23:32.530 --> 23:35.540
[JAKE] ELI?

23:58.770 --> 24:01.650
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER BEING
MARRIED TO YOU.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.810
[YOUNG MAN] YOU AREN'T MARRIED

24:03.860 --> 24:05.480
[ELI] ME.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.070
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LADY?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.030

24:29.090 --> 24:32.260
[ROSE] I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS

24:32.300 --> 24:33.640

24:33.680 --> 24:35.430
[TINNY] WHAT IS THIS?

24:35.470 --> 24:37.470
[ROSE] JUST SAY THANK YOU.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.810
AND I'M SORRY.
I ALMOST KILLED YOU THERE.

24:48.650 --> 24:51.320
[MARTIN] I CAN USE ONE MORE.
THANKS.

24:51.360 --> 24:55.200
[MALACHY] IT'S ON ME.
[MARTIN] WELL, THANK YOU.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.530
SO IT'S NOT JUST A CLICHÉ THEN.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.790
PEOPLE REALLY ARE THAT
FRIENDLY HERE?

24:58.830 --> 25:00.540
[MALACHY] I KNOW.
[MARTIN] I'M LOVIN IT.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.160
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:02.210 --> 25:06.500
[MALACHY] WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
ST. JOHNS MR. POOLE?

25:06.540 --> 25:09.550
[MARTIN] THE COD TONGUES.
[MALACHY] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

25:12.510 --> 25:15.510
I HAD A LOOK AT YOUR RECORD,
ROSES TOO.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.680
REALLY DID A NUMBER ON HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

25:18.720 --> 25:21.560
DRAGGING HER INTO YOUR LITTLE
DRUG TRADE?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
[MARTIN] DRAGGING HER?

25:22.640 --> 25:25.600
WELL, SHE NEVER DID ANY TIME.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.730
[MALACHY] PROBATION ON DRUG
RELATED OFFENSES?

25:27.770 --> 25:29.610
STILL NOTHING FOR HER TO
BE PROUD OF.
[MARTIN] I KNOW.

25:29.650 --> 25:32.240
[MALACHY] AND THE ONLY
REASON SHE DIDN'T GO DOWN
WITH YOU ON A MAJOR CHARGE

25:32.280 --> 25:34.240
WAS THE LACK OF EVIDENCE.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.620
[MARTIN] YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
ME, DID YOU?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.830
NOT UNTIL RIGHT NOW?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.750
IT'S FUNNY THAT SHE NEVER
MENTIONED HER HUSBAND?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.000
WHAT?

25:45.370 --> 25:48.170
[MALACHY] I THINK UH...

25:48.210 --> 25:51.760
YOU BEST BE LEAVING THIS ISLAND
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.470
[MARTIN] YOU I KNOW I NOTICE
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE,

25:53.510 --> 25:57.140
THERE SEEMS TO BE LIKE BASICALLY
TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE IN NEWF--

25:57.180 --> 25:58.430
HOW DO YOU SAY IT RIGHT?

25:58.470 --> 26:00.430
[MALACHY] "NEWFOUNDLAND".
[MARTIN] NEWFOUNDLAND.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.680
YOU GOT ONE TYPE THAT
THEY LOVE IT, NEVER GONNA LEAVE.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.770
THE OTHER TYPE CAN'T WAIT TO
GET THE HELL OUT.

26:07.810 --> 26:10.230
NOW WHICH TYPE DO YOU SUPPOSE
OUR ROSIE IS? CAUSE I DON'T

26:10.270 --> 26:12.230
INTEND ON LEAVING HERE ALONE.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.780
[MALACHY] ROSE ISN'T FROM HERE,
IS SHE? SO...

26:15.820 --> 26:17.740
I GUESS SHE'S ALREADY
MADE HER CHOICE.

26:17.780 --> 26:21.410
[MARTIN] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
OKAY, WELL YOU JUST KEEP
THINKING THAT WAY.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.580
WHY THANK YOU FOR THE RUM B'Y.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.540
[MALACHY] YOU'RE MORE
THAN WELCOME.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.960
[MARTIN] CHEERS.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.430
[JAKE] CONGRATULATIONS.

26:37.470 --> 26:40.760
I ONLY WISH I'D BEEN THERE
FOR THE CEREMONY.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.760
[ANNABELLE] YOU AND ME BOTH.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.850
[ELI] WE HAVE DVD'S
OF THE WEDDING.

26:44.890 --> 26:47.230
HONEYMOON TOO!

26:47.270 --> 26:50.690
[JAKE] CAN I BORROW ANNABELLE
HERE FOR JUST A--

26:50.730 --> 26:52.110
YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU...

26:52.150 --> 26:53.360
ELI?

26:54.320 --> 26:56.320
SO UM...

26:57.740 --> 26:59.740
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:01.120 --> 27:05.290
[ANNABELLE] LOOK IT'S FUNNY.
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF HIM AT ALL.

27:05.330 --> 27:11.790
THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US.
I LIKE HIM.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.420
[JAKE] WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
HE'S CHARMING, RICH.
HE COULD DIE ANY MINUTE.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.340
[ANNABELLE] JAKE.
[JAKE] NOW LOOK.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.710
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

27:17.760 --> 27:21.090
I MEAN YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH FATHER TIME, I GET IT.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.760
[ELI] AMNESIA, POOR THING.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.150
NOW IF YOU WANNA FRESHEN UP,

27:35.190 --> 27:39.780
THE MASTER BEDROOM IS UP
THE STAIRS, TURN LEFT,
END OF THE HALL.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.820
YOU'LL FIND YOUR WALK IN CLOSET
I'M SURE.

27:46.830 --> 27:48.910
YOU'RE A PRINCE AMONG MEN JAKE.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.620
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS
TO ME.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.290
[JAKE] OH,
I THINK I GOT AN IDEA.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.340
YOU'RE A VERY IMPRESSIVE MAN.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.880
[ELI] YES, I AM.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.130
DRINK.

28:01.800 --> 28:06.140
[MALACHY] OH, SCARED ME.
[ROSE] GOT SOMEONE SPYING

28:06.180 --> 28:08.020
ON ME NOW, MALACHY?

28:08.060 --> 28:11.190
[MALACHY] DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
[ROSE] YOU LOOKED ME IN THE

28:11.230 --> 28:13.270
EYE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE FINE
WITH THIS.

28:13.310 --> 28:15.360

28:15.400 --> 28:17.070
[MALACHY] OF COURSE I'M NOT
FINE WITH IT!

28:17.110 --> 28:18.320
[ROSE] YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:18.360 --> 28:20.200
WHEN I MET MARTIN I WAS YOUNG,

28:20.240 --> 28:21.450
AND I WAS A MESS.

28:21.490 --> 28:22.860
[MALACHY] YEAH, THE WILD CHILD.

28:22.910 --> 28:23.740
I GET IT.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.990
[ROSE] IT NEARLY RUINED MY LIFE.

28:25.030 --> 28:26.950
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN AGAIN!

28:26.990 --> 28:29.200
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.870
MALACHY, YOU DO.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.630
[MALACHY] YEAH.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.710
I WAS SPYING ON YOU.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.720

28:45.930 --> 28:48.010

29:10.120 --> 29:13.500
[MALACHY] MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO TO THE BEDROOM
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT?

29:13.540 --> 29:15.290
[ROSE] YES PLEASE.

29:15.330 --> 29:16.920
OKAY &lt;GIGGLES&gt;.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.010
[ELI] I'VE BEEN ALONE IN THIS
RIDICULOUS HOUSE FOR 20 YEARS,

29:21.050 --> 29:24.970
SINCE THE FIRST WIFE CHECKED
OUT. HAD THE ODD DALLIANCE,

29:25.010 --> 29:28.970
SURE. BUT ANNABELLE, WELL...

29:29.010 --> 29:35.980
SHE'S FIERCE, PASSIONATE
ABOUT MUSIC, ARCHITECTURE,
EVERYTHING AND,

29:36.020 --> 29:39.400
WELL IN BED...

29:39.440 --> 29:41.610
SHE'S FIERCE.

29:41.650 --> 29:46.990
[JAKE] YEAH, I GET THE IDEA.
SAD, SADLY.

29:47.030 --> 29:49.660
[ELI] I'D LIKE TO WRITE
YOU A CHEQUE.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.540
25 THOUSAND WILL COVER IT?

29:52.580 --> 29:56.960
[JAKE] &lt;COUGHS&gt;
IS THAT DOLLARS?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.380
[ELI] I LIKE YOU.

29:58.420 --> 29:59.920
TO WHOM SHALL I MAKE IT OUT?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.800
[JAKE] YOU COULD MAKE IT
PERSONALLY, IF YOU WANTED TO.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.840
[ANNABELLE] &lt;SCREAMS&gt;

30:08.430 --> 30:09.640
[JAKE] YOU?!
