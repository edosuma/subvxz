NARRATOR: Previously on Vampire Diaries:
KLAUS: Only thing stronger...

00:05.130 --> 00:07.548
...than your craving for blood,
is your love for this one girl.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.383
Your humanity is killing you.

00:09.551 --> 00:13.804
- Turn it off.
- No!

00:13.972 --> 00:15.139
Turn it off!

00:15.306 --> 00:16.974
- What did you do?
- I fixed him.

00:17.142 --> 00:21.603
Fight for it. Feel something. Anything.
If you don't, you're gonna lose me.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.606
The necklace is a talisman
from the Original Witch herself.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.943
The witch can draw power
from this side because of her talisman.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.653
Bonnie needs to destroy it.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.616
They're looking for Mikael.
The vampire who hunts vampires.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.952
You don't wanna wake him.
He will kill all of you.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.912
I thought you might know
how to kill Klaus.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.831
I can kill Klaus. And I will.

00:41.416 --> 00:45.169
There's a Lockwood legend about a
weapon that can kill an Original.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.504
Like their secrets, they kept it buried.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.006
- I found something.
- What?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.008
I have no idea.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.811
So the Lockwoods have no idea these
tunnels are underneath their property?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.063
Yeah.
Careful where you shine that thing.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.524
Bats hate the light.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.194
Wait, what?

01:10.361 --> 01:11.445
DAMON [WHISPERING]:
Elena.

[GASPS]

01:13.907 --> 01:15.449
- God, Damon.
- Scaredy-cat.

01:15.617 --> 01:20.662
- Just ignore him. That's what I do.
- So you really can't get in?

01:21.539 --> 01:25.959
No, it seems even the ancient
Lockwoods were anti-vampire.

01:27.378 --> 01:31.048
- What do you mean ancient?
DAMON: See for yourself.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.052
This is as far as I go.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.149
- What is all this?
- As far as I can tell, it's a story.

01:49.317 --> 01:53.862
In simple archeological terms,
it's a really, really old story.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.407
That right there is a moon cycle.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.120
A man. A wolf.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.414
- A werewolf.
- Yeah. It's the Lockwood diaries.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.126
- Pictionary-style.
- I don't understand.

02:07.335 --> 02:11.045
I thought the Lockwoods came here
with the original founders in the 1860s.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.382
Well, maybe the Lockwoods did.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.801
But according to this wall...

02:15.969 --> 02:19.388
...these werewolves have been here
a lot longer than that.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.515
- How long?
DAMON: Long.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.851
Gets better. Show her, Ric.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.230
Names. And they're not native.
They're written in runic.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.482
A Viking script.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.401
Vikings?

02:32.569 --> 02:38.073
This name here, when translated,
reads Niklaus.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.576
Klaus.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.580
And Elijah.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.083
And Rebekah.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.427
Rebekah, let me have at it.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.262
REBEKAH:
Quiet, Niklaus.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.473
I'm to have my concentration
if I'm not to slice off a finger.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.268
Father will not like
you handling the blade.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.314
If I want to wield a blade,
I shall wield a blade.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.648
Father need not know.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.318
He will find out. He always does.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.279
That is because you always tell him.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.114
I cannot help it.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.449
He frightens me.

03:22.285 --> 03:27.331
He frightens us all. That is why we stick
together as one. Always and forever.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.918
Right, traitor?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.962
Right.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.548
Here, you finish.
I'm to help mother with the meal.

03:36.716 --> 03:42.804
Yes, go tend to dinner and leave
the blades to the men, little sister.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.725
- Agh, Bekah.
- It is just a little blood.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.311
Be a man about it.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.321
These are the names
of the Original family?

03:59.489 --> 04:04.201
Carved into a cave that's been here since
way before the founding of Mystic Falls.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.204
Or even the entire New World,
for that matter.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.706
Okay, this has gotta be
one of Klaus' fakes.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.167
- That's what I said.
- Well, that could be true.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.004
Except the last name up here
made us think otherwise.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.007
What's the name?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.177
Mikael.

04:22.595 --> 04:27.849
Mikael. Mikael, as in the vampire hunter
who knows how to kill Klaus?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.393
Yep.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.522
I now like to call him Papa Original.

[ALARIC SIGHS]

04:56.838 --> 04:58.213
These images tell a story.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.091
To learn the story,
you have to decipher these images.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.261
- Sloppy.
- Shut up. I'm new at this.

05:04.429 --> 05:09.099
Mason Lockwood said the cave would
lead to a weapon that could kill Klaus.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.810
Unh. But doesn't Mikael have a weapon?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.897
Yes. Which probably means the wall
will lead us to Mikael, who we've found.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.357
- And lost.
- Unh.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.775
[GRUNTS]

05:18.943 --> 05:20.902
Bang. You're dead.

05:21.070 --> 05:25.115
The images, at the very least,
might tell us what that weapon is.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.785
Then all we have to do is find out
what they mean.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.787
Fine. Fine.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.582
If I'm being irritatingly optimistic
like you two...

05:34.584 --> 05:37.169
...how do you suppose we do that?

05:37.587 --> 05:41.006
Well, if the story's about
the Original family living here...

05:41.174 --> 05:43.467
...then we go straight to the source.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.023
You. Goody.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.276
- I was hoping we could talk.
- About what? Stefan?

06:01.944 --> 06:04.446
I'm off him until he starts
treating me better.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.033
In fact, you should take a page
out of my book, if I'm being honest.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.702
Actually, I'd rather talk about this.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.956
I'm curious why you and Klaus
have spent a thousand years...

06:15.124 --> 06:16.958
...running from your father.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.547
I should get back to the girls.
Homecoming's right around the corner.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.884
Well, then maybe I'll ask Mikael
when we wake him.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.683
You're bluffing. You don't know
where he is. No one does.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.187
So then who's rotting
in that old cemetery in Charlotte?

06:38.314 --> 06:41.233
If you wake Mikael,
we are all doomed.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.151
- Tell me.
- Why do you wanna know?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.654
Why don't you want me to wake him?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.742
I need to get back to the girls.

That is precisely my problem.

Why don't you teach me that trick,

- Mm.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.096
I'm stubborn...

30:49.264 --> 30:52.975
...Elijah moral, and Nik...

30:55.103 --> 30:57.855
Nik has no tolerance
for those who disappoint him.

30:58.439 --> 31:03.652
Over a thousand years as a family,
we've all made that mistake at least once.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.322
I've made it several times.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.700
But you still love him?

31:12.829 --> 31:14.955
He's my brother.

31:15.790 --> 31:16.874
And I'm immortal.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.837
Should I spend an eternity
alone instead?

31:30.054 --> 31:32.472
You've heard the story. It's time to go.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.851
I said leave, Elena.
I don't know what you're up to...

31:36.019 --> 31:37.686
...but I'm no longer playing along.

31:37.854 --> 31:41.064
I'm just looking for one good reason
why we shouldn't wake Mikael.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.942
I've given you a thousand.
But you will anyway.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.070
You want him to help you
kill my brother. I'm not stupid.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.448
It's no secret that I want Klaus dead.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.326
He has a hold over Stefan's life.

31:52.493 --> 31:53.535
And over mine.

31:53.703 --> 31:58.457
Do what you need.
Wake Mikael at your own peril.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.584
But make no mistake.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.713
If you come after my brother,
I will rip you apart.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.800
And I get my temper from my father.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.387
Now leave.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.520
- Has Klaus entered the country?
- I can't tell you.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.522
Has he spoken to you since he left?

32:23.691 --> 32:24.858
I can't tell you.

32:25.026 --> 32:31.031
All right. Can you tell me
the last time you spoke to Niklaus?

32:32.450 --> 32:35.202
I am compelled to do what he says...

32:35.370 --> 32:37.955
...and he says
to keep my damn mouth shut.

32:38.164 --> 32:41.667
I really hope this game of
20 Questions isn't your secret weapon.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.212
You see, Damon...

32:46.214 --> 32:49.841
...I've been a vampire hunter
longer than you've been alive.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.386
It's why I found you here.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.346
It's why I'm gonna find Niklaus.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.765
Klaus has been running
for a thousand years.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.184
So if you think you're gonna get
a workaround... Unh!

32:59.352 --> 33:03.271
Careful, Stefan.
One move and his heart's gone.

What's the trick question, Stefan?

[DAMON GROANS]

33:15.076 --> 33:17.703
One twist and he's dead.
Unless you don't care.

33:17.870 --> 33:20.497
His emotions have been shut off.
He can't care.

33:21.624 --> 33:26.753
Really? His link to Klaus is so strong
that he would let his own brother die?

33:29.465 --> 33:32.342
No ideas? Hmm? Think, Stefan.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.223
- I guess you're right.
- Ugh.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.892
- He's a dead end.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.312
- And so are you, Damon.
- Agh!

33:44.480 --> 33:46.481
Wait.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.111
I can bring him back.
I can lure Klaus back to Mystic Falls.

[SIGHS]

33:57.326 --> 33:59.536
And there is our loophole.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.540
Just had to rile him up a bit.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.128
Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls...

34:08.963 --> 34:11.630
...and I will gladly drive a stake
through his heart.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.386
...I'll drive it through yours.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.319
We, uh, filled in what we could.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.156
We've got vampire, werewolf...

34:37.492 --> 34:40.869
...slaughter, mayhem, etc.

34:41.036 --> 34:44.706
That's the white oak tree that was used
in the spell to create the vampires.

34:44.873 --> 34:48.376
Which means that was
when they burned down the tree...

34:48.543 --> 34:50.670
...destroying the only way
they could be killed.

34:50.838 --> 34:54.674
Okay, so tree equals weapon.
Sort of.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.426
But we already knew that.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.720
What we're not sure about is this.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.182
We've got the witch symbol
and what looks like a bleeding heart.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.061
Upside-down figures
usually signify death of some kind.

35:07.730 --> 35:11.024
Mikael killed the witch
by ripping out her heart.

35:13.194 --> 35:16.238
But why is that one connected
to the witch's death?

35:16.405 --> 35:18.573
I don't know.
We haven't gotten that far.

that Mikael killed your mother?

35:38.928 --> 35:40.887
Nik was there. He told me.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.058
He lied to you.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.601
And how do you know that?

35:46.769 --> 35:50.564
The cave where you carved your
family's names is covered in symbols.

35:50.731 --> 35:54.401
The story of your family.
How your parents arrived.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.778
How they made peace.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.573
The spell that turned them
into vampires.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.409
And this.
This is the symbol for hybrid.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.954
It's the combination of the werewolf
and the vampire symbol.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.000
And this is the one for your mother.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.627
Her necklace.

And this is the story of her death.

Not Mikael. Klaus.

No.

- No, he wouldn't.
- She put the curse on him.

36:31.105 --> 36:35.525
Made it so that he would be the only one
of his kind, and then she rejected him.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.862
With the werewolf gene
comes aggression and violence.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.990
When he turned,
all of that was heightened.

36:42.158 --> 36:45.368
He killed her, Rebekah.
And then he made up this entire lie...

36:45.536 --> 36:48.288
...about your father
so that he wouldn't lose you.

36:49.790 --> 36:50.832
