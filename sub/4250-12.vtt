12:40.050 --> 12:41.719
WE'RE HERE
TO SEE HARRIET DENBY.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.054
- AND YOU ARE?

12:44.138 --> 12:46.223
- I'M HER NEPHEW.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.516
YEP.
YOU KNOW.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.768
GOOD OLD
AUNTIE HARRIET.

12:49.852 --> 12:49.935
- I SEE.

12:53.772 --> 12:54.815
IN THERE.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.192
ON THE RIGHT.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.568
- THANKS.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.777
- NOT THAT YOU'LL
GET MUCH SENSE

12:58.861 --> 12:59.862
OUT OF HER, I'M AFRAID.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.866
SHE'S VERY DISTURBED,
POOR THING.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.912
KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
AN ANCIENT EVIL.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.956
[laughter]

13:28.140 --> 13:30.100
- I KNEW YOU'D COME.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.977
- SORRY?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.229
I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.564
- NO.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.359
BUT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.319
YOU'RE ROBERT'S
GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.908
THE LAST DESCENDANT OF
THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.508
- JOY, YOU LOOK--

14:03.842 --> 14:04.969
- NOT LIKE AMBER?

14:05.052 --> 14:06.428
- NO, LIKE JOY,
BUT, LIKE,

14:06.512 --> 14:09.223
EVEN MORE SO, LIKE--

14:09.306 --> 14:10.766
- [babbles]

14:10.849 --> 14:12.935
- YES, THAT.
- THANKS.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.895
- I THOUGHT YOU'D GIVEN UP ON
THE WHOLE MAKEOVER THING.

14:14.979 --> 14:19.275
- WELL, I HAD, BUT YOU
AND KT MADE ME REALIZE

14:19.358 --> 14:20.192
THAT I DIDN'T NEED
A NEW LOOK.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.027
I JUST NEEDED
A NEW ATTITUDE.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.948
- WELL, THAT IS ONE
SMOKING NEW ATTITUDE.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.325
- OKAY, I'M JUST
GONNA SHUT THAT.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.160
OKAY.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.455
[laughter]

14:33.539 --> 14:35.291
- AND TO THINK I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO AVOID DETENTION

14:35.374 --> 14:36.750
ALL THESE YEARS.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.629
- WE CAN BE KING AND
QUEEN OF DETENTION.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.132
UNLESS...

14:43.215 --> 14:44.717
MARA.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.051
I MEAN, YOU TWO ARE LIKE
RELATIONSHIP ROYALTY.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.805
- WE WERE.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.849
PAST TENSE.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.933
I MESSED UP.
SHE DUMPED ME.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.852
- BUT IF SHE KNOWS
YOU'RE SORRY,

14:54.935 --> 14:56.812
THEN WHY WON'T
SHE FORGIVE YOU?

14:56.895 --> 14:57.563
- PROBABLY BECAUSE
I'LL MESS UP AGAIN.

14:57.646 --> 15:01.150
IT'S SORT OF WHAT I DO.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.484
- WELL, IF IT'S
WHAT YOU DO,

15:02.568 --> 15:04.445
THEN IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.906
- YEAH!

15:07.990 --> 15:11.160
I'M KING OF MESSING UP.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.161
KING, I TELL YOU!

15:12.244 --> 15:13.871
- NO, DON'T, IT'LL--

15:13.954 --> 15:15.122
SQUISH YOUR HAIR UP.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.498
- AW, COULD YOU NEVER
BE QUEEN TO A KING

15:16.582 --> 15:18.667
WITH SQUISHED HAIR?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.378
- IF IT WAS YOUR
SQUISHED HAIR,

15:21.462 --> 15:23.505
I THINK I COULD
LIVE WITH IT.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.674
- WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.511
I CROWN YOU

15:29.595 --> 15:32.848
QUEEN WILLOW

15:32.931 --> 15:35.267
OF THE COSTUME CUPBOARD.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.686
YOUR MAJESTY.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.812
[laughter]

15:46.362 --> 15:48.072
- MY FRIENDS
WILL BE WORRIED.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.407
- WHY DON'T
YOU CALL THEM?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.451
LET THEM KNOW
YOU'RE PERFECTLY WELL.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.542
- I THINK THERE'S
BEEN A MISTAKE.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.211
I'M NOT ROBERT'S
GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER

16:02.294 --> 16:03.170
OR GREAT ANYTHING.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.922
I'D NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF HIM

16:05.005 --> 16:06.382
UNTIL I CAME
TO SCHOOL IN ENGLAND.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.008
- BUT I PRESUMED YOUR
GRANDPA WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

16:08.092 --> 16:12.221
MY FATHER WAS
A GREAT FRIEND OF HIS.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.932
I HAD RATHER HOPED
HE'D COME IN PERSON,

16:15.015 --> 16:16.767
BUT HE SAID YOU
WERE UP TO THE JOB.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.853
AND HE MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT,
BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.982
ROBERT'S DESCENDANT.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.860
- YOU'RE THE REAL
HARRIET DENBY.

16:26.944 --> 16:27.611
IT'S YOUR PICTURE
I SAW ON THE WEBSITE.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.280
- I'VE LOST MY DOLL.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.408
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.576
SOMETIMES SHE SPEAKS TO ME.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.123
- THAT'S--
THAT'S NICE.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.251
WE HAVE A TEACHER WHO'S
CLAIMING TO BE YOU.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.252
- CAROLINE.

16:43.335 --> 16:43.836
- YOU KNOW HER?

16:43.919 --> 16:46.463
- ALL MY LIFE,

16:46.547 --> 16:49.091
UNFORTUNATELY.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.467
SHE'S MY SISTER.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.096
- [whispering]
GUYS.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.764
YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE ALL THIS.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.601
- ME AND CAROLINE.

16:59.685 --> 17:04.314
SHE ALWAYS HATED ME.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.441
- YOU DON'T LOOK ALIKE.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.443
- OH, NO,
CAROLINE'S ADOPTED.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.403
- THAT'S OUR
DENBY ALL RIGHT.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.281
- CAN'T GET THROUGH.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.532
- YOU'RE LYING.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.867
WHERE ARE YOUR
FRIENDS, PATRICIA?

17:15.951 --> 17:19.288
AND THIS TIME
I WANT THE TRUTH.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.749
- CAROLINE TOOK MY IDENTITY.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.459
THEN SHE TOOK ROBERT.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.086
THEN SHE TOOK MY FREEDOM
AND LOCKED ME AWAY HERE.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.173
ALL THE STAFF HERE
THINK I'M CRAZY.

17:29.256 --> 17:29.882
[gasps]

17:29.965 --> 17:33.552
WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

17:33.635 --> 17:35.262
PLEASE, HAVE SOME CAKE.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.642
- THANK YOU.

17:45.355 --> 17:48.233
- SO WHY WOULD YOUR "SISTER"
STEAL YOUR IDENTITY?

17:48.317 --> 17:52.237
- TO TAKE MY ROLE
AS KEEPER, OF COURSE.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.740
SHE WANTS TO PERFORM
THE CEREMONY.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.326
SHE WANTS THE GLORY.

17:57.409 --> 17:57.826
- SO IT'S REAL.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.120
- VERY REAL.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.790
AS IS THE EVIL
THAT CAROLINE WILL UNLEASH

18:02.873 --> 18:04.208
WHEN SHE PERFORMS
THE CEREMONY.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.834
- BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT PURE OF HEART.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.835
- HOW CAN WE STOP HER?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
- OH, YOU CAN'T.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.004
IT'S TOO LATE.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.464
- SHE'S LYING.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.840
- KT.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.842
- I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.052
- I'M SORRY.
I'M--

18:17.471 --> 18:19.389
- OKAY.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.892
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO STOP HER, BUT YOU CAN

18:21.975 --> 18:23.560
IF YOU PERFORM THE CEREMONY
JUST LIKE YOU WERE MEANT TO.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.563
[phone ringing]

18:26.647 --> 18:28.774
HOLD ON.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.401
YACKER, WHERE ARE YOU?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.111
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU
GUYS ARE AT THE DISCO,

18:33.195 --> 18:35.322
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.408
I'M STUCK HERE
FINISHING MY KNITTING.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.660
- WHAT?
YOUR WHAT?

18:39.743 --> 18:41.036
- ANYWAYS, IT WAS
NICE SPEAKING TO YOU.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.412
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.497
BYE.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.209
- I HOPE YOU'RE TELLING
THE TRUTH, PATRICIA.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.712
YOU KNOW LYING TO ME
WOULD BE A BAD IDEA.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.048
NOW SCURRY ALONG.

18:53.131 --> 18:56.176
CAN'T HAVE YOU OUT
PAST YOUR CURFEW, CAN WE?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.219
I'M SURE ANY SUCH OFFENDERS
WOULD BE PUNISHED.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.597
SEVERELY.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.822
- THERE'S NO WAY I CAN BE
FROBISHER'S GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER,

19:16.905 --> 19:17.823
IS THERE?

19:17.906 --> 19:20.075
- LOOK, SHE DID SEEM
PRETTY CONFUSED.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.953
JUST TRY NOT
TO WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?

19:23.036 --> 19:24.913
- WHAT IF I AM?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.582
THAT MAKES ME
THE CHILDREN OF CHILDREN.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.584
THE ONE THAT THEY
NEED FOR THE RITUAL.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.918
WHAT IF I'M THE ONE

19:30.002 --> 19:31.920
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO UNLEASH EVIL
INTO THE WORLD, FABIAN?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.089
- GUYS, GUYS,
OKAY, CODE RED.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.592
PATRICIA--
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.304
SHE WAS BEING POLITE.

19:40.387 --> 19:40.846
- POLITE?
- YEAH.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.931
- PATRICIA?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.600
- YEAH, LOOK, I THINK
IT'S HER WAY OF SAYING

19:44.683 --> 19:46.852
THAT SHE WASN'T ALONE.

19:46.935 --> 19:47.644
WELL, OR THAT I'M GETTING
A KNITTED SWEATER

19:47.728 --> 19:49.813
FOR CHRISTMAS.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.274
[phone ringing]

19:52.357 --> 19:52.399
IT'S PATRICIA.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.612
SHE THINKS DENBY'S
ON TO US.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.613
WE'D BETTER GO.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.448
- FINE BY ME.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.783
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT--
YOU TWO GO.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.826
- WHAT?
WAIT.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.869
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.537
- HARRIET'S THE
ANSWER, ALL RIGHT?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
WE NEED HER.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.833
IF SHE PERFORMS THE CEREMONY,
THERE'S NO EVIL.

20:09.917 --> 20:10.959
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.963
RIGHT NOW, SHE'S
THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE.

20:15.047 --> 20:15.964
- OKAY.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.132
OKAY, LET'S GO.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.428
- GET THE BALLS,
GET THE BALLS, GET THE BALLS!

20:21.511 --> 20:22.512
- AH, I STEPPED
IN SOMETHING.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.891
- AH, WHO HAVE WE
COME AS TODAY THEN?

20:26.725 --> 20:29.311
- JOY, ACTUALLY.

20:29.394 --> 20:33.607
I SEE YOU'RE STILL
GOING AS SLIMY RAT FINK.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.233
SO LAST SEASON.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.694
- HEY, SO HOW WAS
DETENTION WITH WILLOW?

20:37.778 --> 20:39.738
HORRIFIC?
ALFIE'S LISTENING.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.697
- IT WAS RATHER
FUN ACTUALLY.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.491
- DETENTION?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.284
FUN?

20:44.368 --> 20:46.370
THOSE ARE TWO WORDS THAT DON'T
BELONG IN THE SAME SENTENCE,

20:46.453 --> 20:48.163
LIKE "DON'T" AND
"EAT THAT CAKE, ALFIE."

20:48.246 --> 20:50.582
OOH, CAKE.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.292
YES.
COOKIES.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.337
- LET'S JUST SAY THE COMPANY
MADE THE OCCASION.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.339
DON'T YOU THINK SHE HAS
REALLY SPARKLY EYES THOUGH?

20:57.422 --> 20:59.383
RATHER LIKE, UH--
MARA!

20:59.466 --> 21:00.509
HEY.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.677
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.387
- IT'S OKAY, JEROME.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.514
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED
OF YOUR EMOTIONS.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.477
- I'M JUST SO SENSITIVE.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.522
- WHICH IS WHY I'M
READY TO FORGIVE YOU.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.857
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
MY BOYFRIEND AGAIN.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.984
I MISSED YOU.

21:20.112 --> 21:24.533
DO YOU REALLY THINK
MY EYES ARE SPARKLY?

21:24.616 --> 21:29.079
- LIKE STARS
IN A CLEAR NIGHT SKY.

21:29.162 --> 21:32.666
- YAY, JEROMEO
AND MARIET ARE BACK ON.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.628
- CAN'T JUST WALK OUT.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.046
BELIEVE ME, I'VE TRIED.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.381
- WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE, OKAY?

21:39.464 --> 21:39.798
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.134
- NO.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.094
- OKAY, I PROMISE,
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.554
JUST WAIT HERE,
AND I'LL MAKE SURE

21:45.637 --> 21:50.267
THE COAST IS CLEAR, ALL RIGHT?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.309
- IT'S CAROLINE DENBY.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.687
I'M HERE TO SEE MY
SISTER, HARRIET.
