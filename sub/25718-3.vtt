WEBVTT

00:55.722 --> 00:57.891
Hey! Gosh!

01:05.690 --> 01:08.777
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

01:12.322 --> 01:16.910
You flirted with me first.
How dare you act like this, wench?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.370
Did you think
things would work out for real?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.748
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.127
Gosh, you plastic monster.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.429
How dare you swear at me?

01:37.013 --> 01:38.640
What did I do so wrong?

01:39.140 --> 01:41.142
What did I do?

01:42.143 --> 01:44.479
What a crazy...
Do you want to die?

01:44.562 --> 01:45.980
That crazy witch. Hey!

02:02.413 --> 02:03.748
It's you, Mi-rae.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.252
Why are you sitting here alone?

02:08.877 --> 02:09.920
Did you drink a lot?

02:12.924 --> 02:14.926
Don't you remember me?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.056
The TA?

02:24.602 --> 02:25.895
Hello.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.814
Is the party already over?

02:28.481 --> 02:29.315
No.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.695
Did something happen?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.116
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.578
Do you want some water?

02:51.754 --> 02:52.839
Have some water.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.508
You're really pretty.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.594
Gosh, you plastic monster.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.638
It's okay.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.309
Kang Mi-rae.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.269
What are you doing?

03:08.521 --> 03:09.689
I'm heading home.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.150
All right, then.

03:13.026 --> 03:13.943
Let's go.

03:14.027 --> 03:14.986
What was your name?

03:16.571 --> 03:17.906
Come on, let's go.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.705
-What are you doing now?
-Mind your own business.

03:25.788 --> 03:28.249
Why are you going with her?
I don't get it.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.793
What are you trying to do
with a girl who's drunk?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.590
What on earth are you thinking?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.927
You're the one who's trying to take her.

03:41.387 --> 03:45.767
I don't know how close you are to her,
but this can be considered violence.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.482
Cut it out. Let's go.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.608
Let go.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.033
You can't just touch me whenever you like.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.428
Thank you.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.269
You didn't have to take me home.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.063
We must make sure
all freshmen get home safely.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.944
Why did you guys come? I'm fine.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.779
We must look after each other.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.074
Hey, we came with her.
You had no reason to worry.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.993
That's why we were worried.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.832
Then get home safely. Thank you.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.584
-Guys, get home safely.
-Okay.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.754
-See you, Sua.
-Bye.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.506
Bye.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.804
Wow, she lives here?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.932
I thought she seemed very well-off.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.101
Her family must be rich.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.790
<i>People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.</i>

05:33.499 --> 05:35.501
<i>Gosh, you plastic monster.</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:40.173
<i>I just wanted to be normal.</i>

05:41.132 --> 05:43.760
<i>All I wanted was a normal life</i>
<i>like everyone else's.</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
<i>Is it something that I can never have?</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:53.186
-What are you doing here?
-My gosh!

05:54.187 --> 05:55.897
Why are you so surprised?

05:55.980 --> 05:58.191
It's me. Don't you remember me?

05:59.984 --> 06:01.194
Do I know you?

06:01.277 --> 06:03.780
What are you talking about?

06:04.155 --> 06:05.865
We met yesterday at the club.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.867
I guess you were really drunk.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.286
I have no idea what you're talking about.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.580
What's going on? Who's this guy?

06:13.915 --> 06:14.791
I don't know.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
Oh, no.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.715
Well, aren't you Yu-ri?

06:23.841 --> 06:25.134
You got the wrong person.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.097
I'm sorry.
You look so much like the girl I know--

06:29.180 --> 06:31.057
Look carefully, will you?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.351
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.811
My apologies.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.941
What was that about?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.652
Mi-rae, are you all right?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.747
He called me a plastic monster.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.499
What?

06:57.375 --> 07:01.212
He said that girls like me are
everywhere in Gangnam.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.297
Who said that? That jerk?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.148
Hey, you should report him.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.525
But I hit him too.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.278
The one who attacks first should be
punished.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.114
What started the fight though?

08:10.198 --> 08:13.326
Him calling me a plastic monster?
Or talking about Gangnam?

08:14.118 --> 08:16.662
It will just end up
with another mean nickname.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.997
This is crazy.

08:20.124 --> 08:23.377
I got plastic surgery done to enjoy
what everyone else enjoys.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.837
What's wrong about it?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.508
Do you think I was too greedy?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.093
You know what?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.429
Hyun Sua? She's ridiculous too.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.097
You said you two are close.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.767
How could she say such a thing
in front of everyone?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.354
She said she didn't know.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.775
What if someone asks me
if I got work done?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.694
I should tell the truth, right?

08:48.778 --> 08:51.322
If you lie and say
that you got nothing done,

08:53.407 --> 08:54.534
you are just obnoxious.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.037
Then shall I tell people
that I only got my eyes and nose done?

08:58.120 --> 09:02.083
Gosh, no. That makes it sound like
you wanted to get more done.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.586
Take out "only".
Just say you got your eyes and nose done.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.630
My, you sure are a psychology major.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.468
How about I tell them about
the face contouring and all the rest?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.637
No, that's not necessary.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.098
Right?

09:17.932 --> 09:20.601
Getting plastic surgery isn't something
to brag about.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.312
Hey, you should still be confident.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.189
Just don't overreact.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.275
Yes, I know.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.361
They'll probably look down on me
if I cause a fuss about it.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.322
People had no respect for me
because I was ugly.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.658
Now, they'll have no respect
because I had plastic surgery.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.288
I'm neither ugly nor pretty.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.207
But then, I'm not average either.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.088
I don't even know myself anymore.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.008
Which category should I adjust myself to?

09:52.091 --> 09:55.469
If you have to choose, you should
adjust yourself to being pretty.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.179
Don't you remember?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.765
A guy told you that you're his ideal type?

10:00.891 --> 10:03.144
That's probably
because he thought I was easy.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.396
Forget it.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.149
Drink up.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.742
Mom.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.538
My son, you came to pick me up.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.545
Hello?

10:29.629 --> 10:33.215
<i>Ma'am, are you back in Korea?</i>
<i>You said you'll be back tomorrow.</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:35.885
<i>We were going to go pick you up.</i>

10:36.135 --> 10:38.137
That's why I came early.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.016
<i>We would feel better</i>
<i>if you'd just let us do our jobs.</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:44.101
There's no need.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.228
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.836
Do Sang-won will support your future!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.257
You should play these kind of songs
to attract the young.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.718
Trot songs are no longer effective
in Seoul.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.888
Are you telling me
to dance like you just did?

11:20.971 --> 11:22.556
No. If you dance like us,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.726
they'll think you only practiced
dancing, not developing policies.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.937
You only need to dance
during the chorus.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.855
Do you think you danced well?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.611
I'll leave the dancing to the promoters.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.664
It'd be nice to have Kyung-seok
stand beside you.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.624
But his birthday hasn't passed yet.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.253
Ah-reum is the prettiest girl
among the politicians' families.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.505
But next  to him,
she is just a squid.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.049
Can you refrain from using
those kind of terms?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.927
You need to focus
on the young voters to win.

12:00.010 --> 12:04.640
If you become the mayor, your next goal
will be to become a governor. And then...

12:06.392 --> 12:09.103
-Sir, you have a phone call.
-Who's calling?

12:09.186 --> 12:11.063
She's the head of Hankook Kelun.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.741
Hello?

12:22.324 --> 12:23.451
It's been a while.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.411
I'm back in Korea.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.579
<i>I know.</i>

12:27.163 --> 12:30.458
I know we're not close enough
to ask each other how we've been doing.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.252
So I'll just cut to the chase.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.673
Please tell Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee
that I wish to meet them.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.968
Why would you meet them?
You don't deserve to see them.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.679
I didn't call to ask for your permission.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.558
I'm only trying to mind my manners,
since you have raised the kids until now.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.269
I'm going to meet my kids,
so just keep that in mind.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.233
She must be out of her mind.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.859
"Can you get up for a second? There are
so many men who wish to date you."

13:38.943 --> 13:41.821
"So I figured I should make you mine
as soon as possible."

13:42.238 --> 13:43.489
"Because you're my girl."

13:44.448 --> 13:46.158
-Do you want to die?
-I'm sorry.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
Did I go too far?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.415
Should I take a break this semester?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.668
What? Are you going to go to the army?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.171
Didn't I tell you last time?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.633
You're the type who goes to the army
after breaking up with someone.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.512
But you didn't even date anyone yet.
So why would you take a break?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.765
Hi, you guys.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.059
Why aren't you heading to class?

14:16.605 --> 14:19.733
Your legs look really long
when you sit like that.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.151
What?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.821
I'll see you later.

14:24.071 --> 14:24.905
Okay.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.247
I guess...

14:33.622 --> 14:36.500
nothing really happened
between you and Sua last night.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.918
Am I correct?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.629
Why did she say, "I'll see you later"?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.131
She meant <i>in class.</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:45.926
I do have long legs.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.930
When did she have the time to notice that?

14:50.180 --> 14:53.392
I think you should go to the army
to get to your senses.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.321
I don't understand Sua.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.533
She should've gotten the message
when she saw Mi-rae hesitating to answer.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.287
She obviously got her eyelids done
and a nose job.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.372
Sua's so slow-witted, I guess.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.499
By the way,

15:18.292 --> 15:21.128
don't you want to know
how she used to look in the past?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.089
Ye-na.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.009
Hello.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.344
Hi.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.929
Kyung-seok.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.599
Can we talk?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.185
He's talking with me right now.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.938
I'm sorry.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.273
I need to talk to him
regarding a class.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.361
We're in the same research team.
He's the leader. I'm the assistant.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.113
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.116
By the way, Ye-na.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.955
You have chili powder stuck
in-between your teeth.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.220
Oh my gosh!

16:16.809 --> 16:20.437
Don't you want to know
how she used to look in the past?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.657
Shouldn't we resolve our misunderstanding?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.951
We're in the same research team.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.166
I apologized to Mi-rae yesterday.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.420
She told me that she was fine.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.797
But I still feel really sorry.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.216
She must've been so flustered.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.762
Every time I saw her,

16:54.763 --> 16:57.558
I was always envious
of how pretty she looked.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.271
I said that because I didn't know
she'd had any plastic surgery.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.273
I'm so slow-witted.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.233
Then why did you ask?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.194
What?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.614
If you didn't know
she got plastic surgery,

17:12.698 --> 17:14.491
why did you ask if she did or not?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.039
I just said that...

17:20.955 --> 17:23.333
without really thinking much about it.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.502
You don't look that thoughtless.

17:27.253 --> 17:30.883
Did you tell Chan-woo that you like him
without thinking as well?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.596
But then again,
you might actually like him.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.182
Well...

17:38.849 --> 17:42.102
I just wanted the seniors to like me.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.188
Do you have more to say?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.442
-What are you guys doing?
-Huh?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.694
Talking about last night.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.912
What happened?
Did Kyung-seok apologize?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.539
Yes, kind of.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.250
I guess he was bothered
by how he treated you.

18:07.503 --> 18:11.006
I told him that I'm okay
and that he shouldn't worry.

18:12.966 --> 18:13.926
Something's fishy.

18:14.968 --> 18:15.886
What?

18:15.969 --> 18:19.056
Why would he cause trouble
and see you in private like this?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.391
Is he playing a <i>tsundere?</i>

18:22.226 --> 18:24.144
Sometimes acting cold just to be nice?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.522
Why would he do that?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.816
I guess you're right. He's not Won-ho.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.028
But if Kyung-seok asks you out,
you might not be able to reject him.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.489
-You're the one who's weird.
-What?

18:35.572 --> 18:38.242
You seem very interested in him.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.035
Do you like him?

18:41.161 --> 18:42.538
What are you talking about?

18:43.038 --> 18:45.290
I prefer guys who are nicer
and approachable.

18:45.958 --> 18:50.045
Kyung-seok is way too cold-blooded.
He's ice cold.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.385
But seriously, why are you so slow-witted?

18:57.010 --> 18:59.138
"Mi-rae didn't do
any plastic surgery either"?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.057
It's so obvious.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.286
-Didn't she get too much done?
-I know, right? It's a bit much.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.663
-Seriously?
-She just stared at us.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.084
-Gangnam Beauty.
-Yes, the typical Gangnam face.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.924
<i>So, this happened again.</i>

19:36.466 --> 19:37.634
<i>Again.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:48.353
KANG MI-RAE

20:00.073 --> 20:01.074
Why are you here?

20:01.909 --> 20:02.910
What?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.369
I'm in this class.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.004
Are you the overly self-conscious type?

20:32.564 --> 20:36.276
Spare me a minute... Let's talk.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.786
You somehow keep getting involved
in my problems.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.413
I hope you stop overreacting.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.168
With the TA and Sua too.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.257
Don't get the wrong idea.
Sua really didn't know.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.933
Anyone could tell that I got work done
on my face, but anyway...

21:08.016 --> 21:09.226
Why did you do it?

21:10.936 --> 21:11.770
What?

21:13.230 --> 21:16.233
Why did you get plastic surgery
on your face?

21:24.324 --> 21:25.784
It's okay, Jung-boon.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.244
I can do it by myself.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.122
Don't be like that. We should take turns.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.749
Being the class representative
shouldn't be a punishment.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.716
Hey, you're
the freshmen representative, right?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.134
Yes.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.722
What do you mean,
why did I get plastic surgery?

21:46.805 --> 21:48.640
You really don't know?

21:49.224 --> 21:52.144
You know that I had no choice
but to get plastic surgery.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.940
What exactly do you mean by that?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.609
Who says it's a must
for some and not for others?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.112
Well, I just meant that...

22:07.701 --> 22:10.620
You know what I used to look like.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.293
I never even dreamed of becoming
as pretty as Sua.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.880
Not even Ji-hyo.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.966
But just like Jung-boon or Eun.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.470
Had I looked like them,
I would've never done it.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.349
But my face was far below the average.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.727
Do you...

22:35.354 --> 22:37.356
grade other people's faces?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.781
You needed surgery
on your unhealthy mindset, not your face.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.500
What did you just say?

22:59.961 --> 23:01.254
It's none of your business.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.674
Why do you even care about what I think?

23:17.562 --> 23:21.149
That jerk. What does he even know?
He has no clue.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.331
<i>You needed surgery</i>
<i>on your unhealthy mindset, not your face.</i>

23:38.875 --> 23:39.960
What did you say?

23:44.589 --> 23:47.342
Kyung-seok, where are you going?
Are you headed home?

23:48.009 --> 23:48.885
Yes.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.971
I must say, you're so gutsy.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.974
The seniors told us to gather,
but you totally ignored it.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.267
You're brave.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.271
-Why do they want us to gather?
-You didn't know?

23:59.729 --> 24:01.731
Don't you check the group chat?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.984
Chan-woo told
all freshmen to assemble.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.944
I wonder what he's up to this time.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.991
Did one of us do
something wrong yesterday?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.285
He must've called the girls too, right?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.121
I wonder if Sua is coming.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.957
He should be embarrassed
that he hasn't graduated yet.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.625
Why did he come to the party?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.920
I'll say something to him.
Gosh, what a hassle.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.885
Hey, you flirted with me first.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.137
How dare you act like this, wench?

24:32.220 --> 24:34.389
You thought
things would work out for real?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.766
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.941
<i>It must be because of me.</i>

24:45.192 --> 24:47.194
<i>I bet he wants to get back at me.</i>

24:50.030 --> 24:52.199
CHOI JUNG-BOON

24:56.203 --> 24:58.205
Hey, Jung-boon.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.168
Yes, I saw it.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.629
He said that he'll teach us
a serious lesson.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.422
I have no idea what it's about.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.175
Well, Eun didn't do anything wrong.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
Do you guys think I'm a joke?

25:26.233 --> 25:27.734
Where's everyone else?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.195
Well...

25:30.278 --> 25:32.280
Many have already gone home.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.866
You are the rudest freshmen
in our entire history.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.201
You know that, you jerks?

25:40.455 --> 25:41.748
Is Kyung-seok not here?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.711
It's all of your responsibility.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.632
Get ready for some real punishment.
You're all dead meat.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.635
Gosh, has he lost his mind?
What's all this about?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.303
In push-up position.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.390
-Sorry?
-I said, in push-up position!

25:58.848 --> 26:00.225
Do I have to repeat myself?

26:00.642 --> 26:01.476
You little...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.728
Chan-woo!

26:05.981 --> 26:08.608
-What is it? Why are you here?
-What are you doing?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.820
What will you do if someone
posts a video of this?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.493
All of you,
run over there in 10 seconds, now.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.038
All of you must give your phone
to Jung-ho.

26:22.163 --> 26:24.082
Hold on to my bag and be on the watch.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.298
-That crazy jerk.
-He'll hear you.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.928
Hurry up!

26:43.727 --> 26:44.936
In push-up position!

26:46.396 --> 26:47.272
What?

26:48.481 --> 26:49.649
Is the space too tight?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.655
Girls can leave.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.741
I never punish girls.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.993
Get out!

27:09.794 --> 27:11.296
Except for you, Mi-rae.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.971
Girls who think they can get pretty
by getting surgery need a serious lesson.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.599
Your face is a reflection of your heart.

27:23.933 --> 27:24.934
Am I wrong?

27:25.018 --> 27:25.977
Answer me.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.397
Then I'll stay too.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.192
What?

27:34.569 --> 27:36.821
I'll stay here with her.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.657
Sua, why...

27:38.782 --> 27:41.910
This has nothing to do with you.
Why would you do that for her?

27:42.535 --> 27:44.496
Then what did I do wrong?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.039
What did you say?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.376
And what did these guys do wrong?

27:51.211 --> 27:52.295
Guys, leave us.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.255
Get out!

28:04.724 --> 28:08.019
You should really be begging me
for forgiveness.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.522
How dare you say
that you've done nothing wrong?

28:11.356 --> 28:14.442
Shall I make your face go back
to how it used to look?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.861
-Don't do this, Chan-woo.
-Get lost!

28:17.237 --> 28:19.447
-Chan-woo, calm down.
-Shut up.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.949
-Chan-woo, please.
-Hey.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.868
Get out, all of you. Get lost!

28:29.374 --> 28:30.333
Hey.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.337
You're the one who told all freshmen
to call me SOB, right?

28:35.046 --> 28:36.172
It was you, wasn't it?

28:37.006 --> 28:38.425
I know it was you!

28:42.303 --> 28:45.432
You and Kyung-seok are
the cockiest ones in your year.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.978
Fine, I'll punish you
for Kyung-seok not showing up as well.

28:51.855 --> 28:52.689
Hey.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.357
Hey.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.322
You crazy jerk.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.244
You must be out of your mind.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.915
I'm going to kill you today.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.793
Let go of this. Let go!

29:28.057 --> 29:29.350
Are you okay?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.332
-Hey, give me your cell phone.
-My gosh.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.833
Hurry.

29:57.003 --> 29:59.297
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT OFFICE
TA: YEON WOO-YOUNG

30:00.465 --> 30:01.549
Come in.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.054
Hi. Please sit down.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.935
It's hard being
the representative, isn't it?

30:12.018 --> 30:14.312
No, it's okay.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.360
I just heard that something happened.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.570
Can you tell me everything?

30:28.368 --> 30:29.494
Yes.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.040
Yes, I think I'll be sleeping there.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.044
Make sure to lock your door
before you sleep.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.005
Okay, bye.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.009
<i>It's been four months.</i>

31:27.010 --> 31:30.305
Tae-sik, you've done enough.

31:30.930 --> 31:34.309
If you want a child
to look exactly like you,

31:34.392 --> 31:36.853
I'll give birth to another baby.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.232
-Mom.
-What are you doing here?

31:41.316 --> 31:42.650
What about class tomorrow?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.527
I'll just get up a little early.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.030
Here. I bought you dumplings.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.658
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

31:51.784 --> 31:54.704
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.372
Where's Dad?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.918
He went to the funeral
of his friend's father.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.339
-Does that mean he's not coming home?
-Probably.

32:06.841 --> 32:11.512
He's feeling a lot better now,
so don't worry too much.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.225
Really?

32:16.851 --> 32:18.853
Yes, he's almost over it.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.690
You didn't come
because something happened?

32:23.566 --> 32:26.152
No, everything's fine.

32:26.569 --> 32:27.820
I'm going to take a shower.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.572
Okay.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.122
Why did you bring your car?
We're going to drink.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.958
I'll just call a chauffeur service.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.168
You live nearby.
That's a waste of money.

32:42.251 --> 32:44.671
Please give us a lot of side dishes.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.465
He'll be buying.
His daughter goes to Hankook University.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.383
Okay.

32:48.466 --> 32:52.387
Show me her entrance ceremony photos.
It's the most prestigious university.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.680
I don't have any photos.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.098
Didn't you take any?

32:55.598 --> 32:57.433
My wife took it with her cell phone.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.519
Then ask her to send them to you.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.729
Let's just drink. Here.

33:03.064 --> 33:06.651
Isn't Mi-rae going to take us on a tour
around the campus?

33:06.734 --> 33:08.987
That's a good idea.
We should pay her a visit.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.489
We won't be able to tour the campus
without Mi-rae.

33:11.572 --> 33:15.410
University students are busy.
She doesn't even have time to come home.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.370
My gosh, you punk.

33:17.537 --> 33:21.290
Look at how arrogant he's being
because Mi-rae goes to Hankook University.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.792
You used to boast about her.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.253
But now,
you're not even talking about her.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.298
-I'm going to leave.
-Gosh, stop.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.009
-Look at him.
-I was kidding.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.301
He gets upset so easily.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.013
I'm buying you drinks.
Come on, let's just drink.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.265
-Come on.
-Congratulations.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.435
I can't believe
she's a student at Hankook University.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.312
I knew she'd get in.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.780
You're a star, Mi-rae.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.452
Gosh, stop watching it and sleep.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.789
I'll watch it again
by myself tomorrow.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.550
Are you having fun at school?

34:13.842 --> 34:15.594
It's not bad.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.472
My gosh.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.558
I guess the money was worth it.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.561
Now that you look pretty,

34:23.895 --> 34:26.606
they're finally seeing your true value.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.110
What's my true value?

34:32.695 --> 34:35.447
You're cute, bright,

34:35.989 --> 34:38.618
nice, and cheerful.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.706
You've been cheerful
ever since you were a baby.

34:45.208 --> 34:49.587
On your first birthday,
you danced so well

34:49.670 --> 34:52.465
that everyone thought you'd grow up
and become a celebrity.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.971
Now,

34:59.722 --> 35:01.933
you should make a lot of friends

35:02.517 --> 35:04.644
and have lots of fun.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.646
Enjoy your life.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.358
It'll be the best years of your life.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.490
Mom, I'm sleepy.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.493
Yes.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.495
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.040
You need to wake up early
for school tomorrow.

35:44.892 --> 35:48.396
Look at you acting like a baby
after hearing about your first birthday.

35:50.189 --> 35:54.110
Mom, you must've had a hard time
because of me until now.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.656
Life is...

35:59.907 --> 36:02.952
all about fighting
through your struggles.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.540
People might seem
like they're living a worry-free life.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.627
But they're all just trying their best
to keep living.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.469
I like how you smell, Mom.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.015
Gosh, you're so sensitive to smell.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.100
My cute little baby.

36:27.310 --> 36:31.063
I'm so glad to hear
that you're doing well in school.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.244
Sir, you can't enter
because you drank alcohol.

36:46.412 --> 36:49.957
<i>You have one new message.</i>

36:50.917 --> 36:53.878
<i>Tae-sik, you've done enough.</i>

36:54.503 --> 36:57.632
<i>If you want a child</i>
<i>to look exactly like you,</i>

36:57.798 --> 37:00.426
<i>I'll give birth to another baby.</i>

37:02.637 --> 37:04.847
<i>-Mom.</i>
<i>-What are you doing here?</i>

37:04.931 --> 37:08.184
<i>-What about class tomorrow?</i>
<i>-I'll just get up a little early.</i>

37:08.935 --> 37:10.478
<i>Here. I bought you dumplings.</i>

37:11.020 --> 37:14.106
<i>How nice. I was feeling hungry.</i>

37:15.107 --> 37:17.944
<i>She even bought dumplings for her dad.</i>

37:18.653 --> 37:19.695
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

37:24.158 --> 37:27.245
VOICE MESSAGE

37:43.678 --> 37:45.805
Did you hear a freshman beat up a senior?

37:45.888 --> 37:46.722
Really?

37:46.806 --> 37:50.268
The senior flew
from the first bathroom stall to the last.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.271
-Means he flew at least eight meters.
-Exactly.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.690
-The fight ended in two seconds.
-Come on.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.527
He dodged the mop
and did a full 360 turn, then kicked him.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.945
-Have you heard?
-What?

38:01.028 --> 38:03.823
-His jaw and ribs are all broken.
-Seriously?

38:03.906 --> 38:05.533
-That is crazy.
-My gosh.

38:06.701 --> 38:10.288
Shouldn't we persuade him
to transfer to our department?

38:10.746 --> 38:11.580
What's his name?

38:12.665 --> 38:15.835
What was it... Was it Do Kyung-seok?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.670
-Do Kyung-seok?
-Do Kyung-seok.

38:17.753 --> 38:22.341
Why did he show up
when I was just about to kick him?

38:24.218 --> 38:25.636
Just go to the military.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.893
If I were him, I'd drop out of school.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.813
Hey, get it out of my face.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.773
Hey!

38:37.857 --> 38:40.359
By the way, why did he do that
to Mi-rae?

38:40.443 --> 38:43.070
Did that SOB ever need reasons?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.781
I guess he wanted to have fun,
but it didn't go well.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.284
But still, how could he do that
to a senior?

38:48.367 --> 38:51.370
You call a mop your senior?
He doesn't deserve our respect.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.040
So is Mop his new nickname now?

38:54.123 --> 38:55.458
Isn't it so gratifying?

38:56.042 --> 38:59.086
My, I'd love to be
as gutsy as Kyung-seok.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.882
He's not only handsome,
he's charming, too!

39:06.135 --> 39:09.096
Is she not coming to class today?
Shall I try calling her?

39:11.223 --> 39:13.142
We still have some time
until class starts.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.190
<i>What if worse things happen?</i>

39:20.566 --> 39:23.027
<i>What if Kyung-seok gets</i>
<i>in trouble because of me?</i>

39:23.944 --> 39:25.071
Mi-rae!

39:30.785 --> 39:31.994
Are you okay?

39:35.206 --> 39:39.752
Everyone thinks that Kim Chan-woo
is a total jerk, so don't worry.

39:40.836 --> 39:43.714
I shouldn't have told everyone to come.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.758
I'm sorry.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.220
I deeply regret just standing there
and doing nothing.

39:49.303 --> 39:51.764
I should've spoken up,
no matter how scared I was.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.391
Don't say that.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.601
I know that you had no choice.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.603
I'm the one who should apologize.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.271
It was all because of me.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.856
Hey, that is not true.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.652
It's my fault for not doing a good job
as the representative.

40:05.694 --> 40:06.821
I'm sorry, Mi-rae.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.617
You must've been terrified.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.829
I felt so bad
that I couldn't even sleep last night.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.998
Chan-woo, that jerk.
We should've taught him a real lesson.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.250
That's what I'm saying.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.794
We should've rubbed the mop
all over his face.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.423
-I'm Kim Sung-woon.
<i>-80 out of 100.</i>

40:26.090 --> 40:28.592
<i>I'd give her 85 when she's dressed up.</i>

40:28.926 --> 40:31.262
Gosh, I told you guys
to just talk casually.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.264
-I'm Choi Jung-boon.
<i>-70 out of 100?</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:34.932
<i>She has a cute, friendly face.</i>

40:35.015 --> 40:36.684
<i>Are you the one that created...</i>

40:37.184 --> 40:38.269
You're right.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.773
<i>They're such nice people.</i>
<i>What on earth was I thinking?</i>

40:43.399 --> 40:47.653
<i>I judged them by their looks</i>
<i>and graded their faces.</i>

40:49.613 --> 40:50.531
I'm sorry.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.161
For what?

40:57.955 --> 40:59.748
And thank you both so much.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.588
I just did what anyone would've done.

41:06.213 --> 41:10.176
It wasn't easy to volunteer
to stay behind with me in that situation.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.180
I couldn't leave you alone there.
We're friends.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.727
To tell you the truth,
I felt like I owed you an apology.

41:20.686 --> 41:25.524
I wondered if Chan-woo was taking things
out on you... because of me.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.321
He actually told me that he liked me,

41:30.738 --> 41:33.282
but I rejected him
because it was so uncomfortable.

41:34.825 --> 41:39.163
And, he asked if it was because of you.
He totally jumped to his own conclusions.

41:40.456 --> 41:43.501
Then did you gossip to Sua
to stab me in the back?

41:43.584 --> 41:46.504
She says she can't go out with me
because you like me.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.297
What did I do?

41:48.380 --> 41:50.716
What did you do? Hey!

41:50.841 --> 41:54.345
You flirted with me first.
How dare you act like this, wench?

41:59.683 --> 42:02.186
That's why I thought
he was taking it out on you.

42:02.978 --> 42:03.938
I felt so bad.

42:05.272 --> 42:06.440
No.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.108
You did nothing wrong.

42:08.859 --> 42:11.028
You obviously had to reject
a jerk like him.

42:12.112 --> 42:15.449
Now, everyone calls him Mop
instead of SOB.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.700
Really?

42:17.284 --> 42:19.245
I think that nickname suits him better.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.457
<i>Mi-rae is quite brave.</i>
<i>She spoke up in that situation.</i>

42:23.541 --> 42:25.834
Whatever. Sua was the brave one.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.838
I'm impressed that she stood up for Mi-rae
in that situation.

42:30.339 --> 42:33.425
My gosh. She's pretty
and such a loyal friend as well.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.803
<i>She's pretty and thoughtful.</i>

42:36.887 --> 42:38.806
I didn't even do much.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.810
Frankly, Kyung-seok was the one
who really came to rescue you.

42:49.692 --> 42:53.487
I must say, it seems like
he gives you special treatment.

42:54.196 --> 42:56.323
-Aren't I right?
-What do you mean?

42:56.907 --> 42:59.159
Are you two going out, by any chance?

42:59.743 --> 43:00.619
What?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.915
Hey, I heard Kang Mi-rae came
to school today.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.001
-Seriously?
-Yes.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.461
I thought she'd take a few days off.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.714
She's much stronger than I thought.

43:20.180 --> 43:24.768
The time when I made that mistake
at our party, and this time too.

43:25.644 --> 43:28.647
It's like he can't stand
seeing you in difficult situations.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.482
Well, that's...

43:31.025 --> 43:32.526
Or are you still flirting?

43:32.901 --> 43:34.778
What? It's really not what you think.

43:35.446 --> 43:38.907
No? But I've seen the two of you
talking about your secrets.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.201
Secrets? When?

43:41.285 --> 43:46.040
That day in front of the vending machine.
When you were with Eun and Jung-boon.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.294
-Thanks for this.
-Mi-rae.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.177
Let's have a quick talk.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.933
What's going on? A secret chat
between just the two of you?

44:07.353 --> 44:08.812
My perfume container...

44:08.896 --> 44:11.065
He must've confessed
his feelings for you.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.112
Does he have crush on you?

44:17.196 --> 44:19.323
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.450
That's because we're alumni...

44:22.117 --> 44:23.410
<i>I must be out of my mind.</i>

44:25.120 --> 44:28.040
Alumni?
Did you guys go to the same school?

44:30.000 --> 44:30.834
Yes.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.461
Oh, really?

44:32.961 --> 44:36.840
I had no idea.
Which school? High school?

44:36.924 --> 44:38.467
No, middle school.

44:39.093 --> 44:42.179
<i>I asked Kyung-seok not to tell anyone</i>

44:42.513 --> 44:44.640
<i>and ended up exposing my past myself.</i>

44:53.774 --> 44:56.694
I told you that wench
Kang Mi-rae hit me first.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.822
Do you believe the freshmen's words
over my words?

45:00.364 --> 45:01.281
Hey, Chan-woo.

45:04.493 --> 45:05.744
Regardless of the reason,

45:06.537 --> 45:08.789
if you bother freshmen one more time,

45:10.290 --> 45:12.459
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.502
You got that?

45:14.753 --> 45:18.757
I'm going to talk to every single freshman
and expose every bad deed you've done.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.677
I'll make sure
you get no reference letter.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.679
If you manage to get a job without it,

45:23.762 --> 45:27.391
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done,

45:28.726 --> 45:29.643
so brace yourself.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.938
You know I can do anything
I set my mind to.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.399
Hey, but still...

45:36.108 --> 45:38.485
-We're friends--
-The fact that we're friends...

45:40.195 --> 45:42.239
embarrasses me so much.

45:44.074 --> 45:45.576
I really can't stand it.

45:48.495 --> 45:49.413
I'm sorry.

45:51.623 --> 45:52.583
You can leave now.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.446
-Hey.
-Have you eaten yet?

46:22.529 --> 46:23.655
-All right.
-What?

46:23.739 --> 46:24.615
What?

46:26.450 --> 46:27.659
Shall we eat together?

46:29.328 --> 46:30.287
Yes.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.627
It's on me.

46:37.669 --> 46:38.504
Why?

46:39.546 --> 46:40.589
Because I owe you.

46:41.131 --> 46:41.965
You owe me?

46:44.009 --> 46:45.344
Stir-fried spicy pork.
You?

46:45.427 --> 46:47.721
You just pressed a button for pork cutlet.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.226
STIR-FRIED SPICY PORK

47:00.317 --> 47:01.652
-Awesome.
-Goodness.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.655
-Did you find out just now?
-I didn't know either.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.242
It's not a big issue,
so why didn't she tell us about it?

47:08.784 --> 47:09.660
I know.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.247
-Hi.
-Guys, check this out.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.208
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok went
to the same middle school.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.418
-Is that right?
-I knew it.

47:19.294 --> 47:22.589
That must be why Kyung-seok got
all worked up yesterday.

47:23.173 --> 47:27.177
But I don't think they were that close.
I heard he transferred to another school.

47:28.011 --> 47:31.223
It's not like they aren't close.
I saw them have a meal together.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.225
-By themselves?
-Yes.

47:33.308 --> 47:34.768
Just saw them in cafeteria.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.979
Seeing how he's so attentive towards her,

47:37.062 --> 47:39.731
I guess Mi-rae wasn't that bad
before her surgery.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.359
Maybe he had a crush on her in the past.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.278
No way.

47:45.153 --> 47:47.197
-I'm 100% sure.
-You have a point.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.994
Are you forcing yourself
to eat pork cutlet?

47:52.619 --> 47:54.621
-Because of me?
-No.

48:00.627 --> 48:03.255
When you said you owed me,
was it about Chan-woo?

48:04.464 --> 48:05.299
Yes.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.344
Thank you.

48:13.682 --> 48:16.476
I thought you'd be mad.
What is it that you want to say?

48:19.646 --> 48:21.565
I hate myself for being like this too.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.568
Judging people by their looks

48:24.651 --> 48:26.194
and labeling them.

48:28.030 --> 48:31.950
People who think you're a cool guy
who lives your own way don't understand...

48:32.993 --> 48:34.328
a life like mine.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.126
I'm sorry...

48:42.878 --> 48:44.421
for talking harshly to you.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.843
You know, what I said about your mindset.

48:51.595 --> 48:52.721
I'm sorry about that.

48:53.805 --> 48:54.640
Well...

48:56.350 --> 48:58.310
What you said about me wasn't wrong.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.900
By the way, do people think I'm cool?

49:06.652 --> 49:07.569
Who said that?

49:12.324 --> 49:13.492
Is that what you think?

49:14.034 --> 49:14.868
No.

49:16.161 --> 49:19.790
You were popular back in middle school.
Didn't you know?

49:21.333 --> 49:22.542
I guess I was.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.798
-You're annoying.
-Hey.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.884
-What?
-Have you always thought I was annoying?

49:31.343 --> 49:33.428
No, sorry.

49:33.512 --> 49:36.515
I was just asking.
Are you intimidated again?

49:36.598 --> 49:39.142
-What?
-You keep getting intimidated for nothing.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.313
When did I?

49:43.981 --> 49:46.149
I'm not the one
who easily gets intimidated.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.945
Then live the way you originally were.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.372
PART-TIMERS NEEDED

50:02.749 --> 50:04.626
I've got my health certificate.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.920
I can start working right away.

50:09.548 --> 50:12.551
It's great. Everything is nice,

50:12.634 --> 50:15.846
but your dialect is a bit...

50:16.638 --> 50:18.724
I can fix it right away.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.560
It's quite hard to fix your dialect.

50:21.643 --> 50:24.521
No, I'm very good at speaking
in Seoul accent.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.523
-Look.
-Yes?

50:26.606 --> 50:28.608
There's a pretty girl
in your department?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.819
-Who?
-Was her name Hyun Sua?

50:31.778 --> 50:32.738
Sua?

50:34.531 --> 50:36.700
Isn't she interested in working part-time?

50:40.662 --> 50:43.623
I'm Hyun Sua, a freshman chemistry major
in Hankook University.

50:44.332 --> 50:45.375
I see.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.546
I might not be good at working
since it's my first time.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.965
But I'll work hard and learn quickly.

50:52.549 --> 50:56.720
There's nothing much to learn.
The way you are now is fine.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.139
-What?
-Just...

50:59.890 --> 51:00.974
as you are.

51:03.393 --> 51:05.103
Can you start tomorrow?

51:05.896 --> 51:07.939
Oh, thank you.

51:14.029 --> 51:17.157
Scholarship is the best thing
you can do for your parents.

51:17.365 --> 51:18.617
Let's go out.

51:24.831 --> 51:25.749
Really?

51:26.083 --> 51:27.834
Kyung-seok apologized to you first?

51:28.418 --> 51:29.336
Yes.

52:02.285 --> 52:03.161
Hey.

52:05.163 --> 52:06.581
Are you wearing perfume?

52:07.958 --> 52:11.086
Maybe you were mistaken about him.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.922
He might not have laughed at you.

52:14.005 --> 52:16.007
Even if that's the case,

52:16.341 --> 52:19.052
he definitely asked me about the perfume
to pick on me.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.263
I guess he became nice as he grew up.

52:22.597 --> 52:25.100
He didn't tell anyone
that you went to the same school.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.729
Phew, let's go in.

52:31.606 --> 52:34.860
I don't fully get the situation,
but I'm sure he's on your side,

52:34.985 --> 52:37.237
judging by how he taught the senior
a lesson.

52:44.119 --> 52:45.120
What is it?

52:45.203 --> 52:46.454
Is this for real?

52:47.497 --> 52:49.332
I won a ticket to the perfume event.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.168
I thought it was something serious.

52:51.251 --> 52:53.795
Hey, it's awfully hard to win this ticket.

52:54.421 --> 52:57.424
I can bring another person with me.
Let's go together.

52:57.507 --> 52:58.675
No.

52:59.092 --> 53:00.719
Guest performance by Junoflo?

53:00.802 --> 53:02.929
Are you serious? Give me that.

53:04.181 --> 53:08.476
It's for real. Hey, take me there.
You must go with me, okay?

53:08.768 --> 53:10.312
No one else to go with anyway.

53:10.395 --> 53:12.189
-You said no.
-Yes, I must go.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.692
Take me for sure, okay?
I'll be your servant!

53:17.903 --> 53:18.820
Kyung-seok.

53:19.654 --> 53:21.615
You and Mi-rae went to the same school?

53:25.035 --> 53:27.412
-Who said that?
-Mi-rae.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.708
Sua said that she heard it from Mi-rae.

53:33.585 --> 53:35.420
Why? Is it a secret?

53:39.507 --> 53:42.677
What was that? Does he think
I speak to him because I like him?

53:45.764 --> 53:46.932
Pay for this one too.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.896
Did he just order us to pay for him?

53:53.521 --> 53:54.773
Why that little...

53:55.607 --> 53:57.484
He hasn't come to his senses yet.

53:59.027 --> 54:00.779
Should I teach him a lesson?

54:01.821 --> 54:04.449
I can teach him a better lesson
than Kyung-seok.

54:06.993 --> 54:10.538
-Please wait.
-Didn't you say you'd treat me?

54:13.458 --> 54:15.210
-Hello.
-I'll pay for theirs too.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.426
Thank you for the food.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.803
-Thank you.
-No problem.

54:24.928 --> 54:25.845
Thank you.

54:27.889 --> 54:29.724
That's the true example of a senior.

54:39.609 --> 54:40.819
Annoying punk.

54:43.280 --> 54:47.200
A heated flask is extremely hot.
Never touch it with your bare hands.

54:47.617 --> 54:50.829
A student almost went blind
when heated acid splattered on his eye,

54:50.912 --> 54:52.580
So be extra careful.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.959
Now, come out and take the equipment now.

54:58.962 --> 55:01.798
Those female students with long hair
must tie it up.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.049
Okay.

55:40.003 --> 55:41.838
You asked me not to tell others.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.299
-I don't get it.
-Huh?

55:45.842 --> 55:47.927
They know
that we went to the same school.

55:49.888 --> 55:52.432
I know. They somehow found out.

55:55.810 --> 56:00.315
We converted the volume of Reactant A
to the mole of A.

56:00.774 --> 56:03.985
Don't you think Sua and Kyung-seok
look great together?

56:04.069 --> 56:06.988
Then we calculated the volume
of Reactant B that's needed.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.657
Watch what you say in front of me.

56:23.880 --> 56:27.425
Heat it up to 70 degrees Celsius
in hot water.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.181
Goodness.

56:36.976 --> 56:37.936
You burn your hand?

56:39.187 --> 56:40.855
-No.
-Let me see.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.735
-I'm okay.
-Then why are you hiding it?

56:46.778 --> 56:47.612
Are you hurt?

56:48.279 --> 56:50.782
-No, I just brushed up against it.
-Let me see.

56:51.658 --> 56:54.077
-What happened?
-Did she get hurt?

56:55.954 --> 56:57.914
-You have to be careful.
-Oh, no.

57:02.919 --> 57:05.547
It seems okay,
but cool it down with cold water.

57:05.672 --> 57:06.506
Okay.

57:06.589 --> 57:09.134
I told you not to touch
the hot flask directly.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.302
I'm sorry.

57:12.554 --> 57:14.722
Focus and be careful, everyone.

57:15.390 --> 57:16.391
-Be careful.
-Okay.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.781
Good job today.

57:31.865 --> 57:34.617
Put the equipment in each basket
and return them safely.

57:34.701 --> 57:35.910
-Okay.
-Okay.

57:36.995 --> 57:38.580
Check if we missed anything.

57:43.126 --> 57:45.462
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.214
-No, I'm okay.
-Give me the flask.

57:50.383 --> 57:51.301
Thank you.

57:51.384 --> 57:53.553
-Give me that too.
-Okay.

58:01.186 --> 58:02.645
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?

58:05.190 --> 58:06.774
What is it?
Hydroxide solution?

58:07.192 --> 58:09.861
Yes, I'm sorry.

58:09.944 --> 58:13.072
-Go wash it off and go to the dispensary.
-Okay.

58:13.948 --> 58:15.617
-Watch the glass.
-Hey!

58:22.832 --> 58:24.459
I told you to be careful.

58:25.960 --> 58:27.003
I'm sorry.

59:02.455 --> 59:03.915
What if it was on her face?

59:03.998 --> 59:05.083
Did you drop it?

59:05.166 --> 59:07.418
Is it because of the earlier mistake?

59:07.502 --> 59:09.254
You're so prickly. Impressive.

59:09.337 --> 59:10.922
I can't beat you on that front.

59:11.005 --> 59:12.507
Surprising news. Ta-da.

59:12.590 --> 59:15.468
It's strange.
She isn't in the group picture either.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.761
I wonder why.

59:16.844 --> 59:17.679
Mi-rae.

59:17.762 --> 59:22.100
<i>Those who help you without</i>
<i>your knowledge are truly nice people.</i>

59:22.183 --> 59:24.686
How's Dad? He doesn't pick up my calls.

59:24.769 --> 59:26.396
Tae-sik!

59:26.479 --> 59:27.939
I'm at the perfume event.

59:28.022 --> 59:31.276
I searched everywhere.
Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee are not here.

59:31.359 --> 59:35.905
Dad said he'll send me to the States.
I might not miss Dad, but I'll miss you.

59:35.989 --> 59:38.491
<i>It's essential</i>
<i>you and Kyung-seok serve at the bar.</i>

59:38.575 --> 59:40.368
<i>I heard a strange sound again.</i>

59:40.451 --> 59:42.036
<i>Someone was following.</i>

59:42.120 --> 59:43.955
<i>President Na Hye-sung of Kelun.</i>

59:44.038 --> 59:45.999
-She's our alumna.
-What?

59:46.082 --> 59:47.875
She's that woman.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.587
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

59:50.670 --> 59:52.589
Are you okay? I was worried about you.

59:52.672 --> 59:55.216
-It's none of your business.
<i>-I also hate those</i>

59:55.300 --> 59:58.094
<i>who vent their anger on other people.</i>
