WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:12.012
(rumbling)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.739
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
This asteroid was only the size

00:38.772 --> 00:40.374
of a small house,
but generated

00:40.408 --> 00:41.775
a force 30 times greater

00:41.809 --> 00:43.077
than the bomb at Hiroshima.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.378
How did we miss it, Neil?

00:44.412 --> 00:45.813
Carol, there are thousands

00:45.846 --> 00:48.149
of dangerous
Near Earth Objects out there.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.717
The problem with meteors

00:49.750 --> 00:51.385
like the one
that exploded over Russia?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.587
We just don't even know
they're there

00:53.621 --> 00:55.456
until it's too late.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.491
*

01:04.365 --> 01:08.736
* Ain't no future
in the youth *

01:08.769 --> 01:12.873
* No more culture
within your crew... *

01:12.906 --> 01:15.109
All right.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.578
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
MIT alumnus and tech pioneer

01:17.611 --> 01:19.647
Darius Tanz!

01:19.680 --> 01:23.217
(applause and cheering)
* Come someone,
tell me what to do *

01:23.251 --> 01:25.886
* Gotta build

01:25.919 --> 01:29.123
* And destroy

01:29.157 --> 01:31.159
* They'll rebuild

01:31.192 --> 01:33.194
* And destroy...
(woman gasps)

01:33.227 --> 01:34.662
TANZ:
How many ways are there to die?

01:34.695 --> 01:37.331
Sure, there's, you know,
grandma-kicks-the-bucket,

01:37.365 --> 01:41.202
small-bore stuff, but I'm
talking about the big kahuna.

01:41.235 --> 01:46.240
Pandemics, nuclear wars,
global warming, fast food.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.409
(laughter)
There are infinite ways

01:48.442 --> 01:49.843
to die, of course.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.445
You and me--
we're all gonna go

01:51.479 --> 01:54.382
somehow, some way,
but the human race...

01:54.415 --> 01:57.251
The human race doesn't have to.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.887
* Build, destroy

02:01.289 --> 02:03.691
* Oh-oh, oh-oh, rebuild

02:03.724 --> 02:06.194
* Destroy.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.263
(doors shutting loudly)

02:09.297 --> 02:11.299
TANZ:
I know we all
appear to be

02:11.332 --> 02:12.866
safe and cozy here on our

02:12.900 --> 02:14.935
post-Paleolithic pedestal, but

02:14.968 --> 02:17.205
I assure you,
things can change.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.207
Rapidly.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.608
(whispering):
Dude.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.211
Sorry. I was in the lab
all night.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.313
TANZ:
There have been
at least five mass

02:25.346 --> 02:27.548
extinction events
in the last few

02:27.581 --> 02:28.816
hundred million
years, people.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.484
Five.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.952
If we don't want
to end up like

02:31.985 --> 02:34.188
the dinosaurs,
we need an exit strategy.

02:34.222 --> 02:38.792
That is why colonizing Mars
is not just a pipe dream.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.461
It's a necessity.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.196
Now I can see

02:42.230 --> 02:43.631
all these skeptical MIT faces

02:43.664 --> 02:45.499
looking back at me, thinking,

02:45.533 --> 02:47.835
"Will you give me a job
after graduation?"

02:47.868 --> 02:50.704
(laughter)
Maybe.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.974
Maybe? Well, except for the guy
who got here late,

02:54.007 --> 02:55.543
the one without the shoes.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.478
(laughter)

02:57.511 --> 03:00.881
But seriously,
we've put all our eggs

03:00.914 --> 03:02.450
into one cosmic basket.

03:02.483 --> 03:06.354
If the universe decides
to plant its big old ass

03:06.387 --> 03:08.722
into that basket...

03:08.756 --> 03:10.291
(imitates crushing sound)

03:10.324 --> 03:11.992
...we're toast.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.328
MAN:
Crazy.
Thanks.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.364
We can't go up to him
with our résumés

03:16.397 --> 03:17.731
now, Shoeless.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.733
Many have tried to
approach the king.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.569
Few make it past
the castle gates.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.271
He always stays
at the Royale.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.338
We should go
over there

03:24.372 --> 03:25.739
and pitch him ideas.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.375
Way to get noticed.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.285
Zoe, breakfast is ready!

03:38.619 --> 03:40.288
I'll be home around

03:40.321 --> 03:41.755
6:00ish. We can have
an early dinner.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.324
Mom, you forgot.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.260
Graduation rehearsal.
How is the speech going?

03:46.294 --> 03:49.363
Want me to take a look at it?
No, I got it under control.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.300
You know, I kind of
do this for a living.
Mom, don't micromanage.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.835
And please don't give me that
"I'm so proud of you" look.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.037
This is the
"I'm gonna miss you" look.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.006
Duke is only
262 miles away.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.041
That's what I keep
telling myself.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.512
Hey, um... Dad was wondering

04:04.545 --> 04:06.547
if you're gonna use
that extra ticket

04:06.580 --> 04:07.781
for graduation?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.317
(car horn tooting)
That's Kira.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
I got to fly.
Just call him. Please?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.721
Okay.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.056
(elevator bell dings)

04:16.089 --> 04:17.891
Are you bringing a date

04:17.925 --> 04:19.460
to our daughter's graduation?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.762
No, I wasn't planning
on using it, Mike.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.532
That's not the point.
These tickets are for family.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.368
Because I don't think either of
us should bring a date, Mike.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.470
The day is about
Zoe, not about us.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.771
I can't talk about this
right now.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.406
I'm walking into a meeting.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.941
MAN:
Grace, why don't you start?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.043
We had a non-combat
related death in Germany--

04:36.076 --> 04:37.711
a warrant officer.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.912
Worked Intelligence
at Fort Gordon.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.315
Okay, draft a press release
once the family's informed.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.952
Will do.
Jordy, I need to brief SecDef
on Russian military moves.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.787
As of 0400, the Russians
began deploying at least

04:46.820 --> 04:48.356
three divisions,
about 50,000 troops,

04:48.389 --> 04:49.823
to the Ukrainian border.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.559
They claim we've been
making some unusual moves

04:51.592 --> 04:53.494
with some of our nukes.
Okay. Grace,

04:53.527 --> 04:55.329
have your team
release a statement

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
to the media.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.965
Stress that this is just
routine maintenance

04:57.998 --> 04:59.800
of the nuclear arsenal,
and our Russian friends

04:59.833 --> 05:01.969
are bent out of shape
over nothing, but

05:02.002 --> 05:03.837
say it nice, like you do.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.506
Certainly, sir.
Okay.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.409
The world is safe for today.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.743
Grace?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.412
A word in my office?

05:17.785 --> 05:20.354
So, I have some news.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.756
Your transfer
request came through.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.725
Where'd you hear that?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.761
Well, I'm fairly high up at the
Pentagon, in case you forgot.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.397
(laughs)

05:29.430 --> 05:32.500
They need someone to run Public
Affairs over at Fort Myer.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.003
This is perfect.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.005
I'll be just
up the road.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.775
And you... won't
be my boss anymore.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.144
We can finally be
out in the open.
Mm.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.846
No more sneaking around.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.448
Yeah.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.550
You can meet Zoe,
I can meet Dylan.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.420
We can be a
normal couple.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.155
Although, you know,
sneaking around was kind of fun.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.959
(laughs)

05:58.992 --> 06:00.461
Mm.
(sighs)

06:00.494 --> 06:02.162
I'll miss having you here.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.998
Mm. You'll have me
everywhere else.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.434
Yeah.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.035
(knocking)

06:08.068 --> 06:09.970
(clears his throat)
Come in.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.706
Sir, the Joint Chief's
on the line.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.107
I'm told it's urgent.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.543
Send it in.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.988
WOMAN:
Spicy chicken burritos,
extra salsa,

06:28.021 --> 06:29.557
extra avocado?
Yeah, that's me.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.559
Dude, the three-body problem
is unsolvable.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.993
No one's ever done it.
No one's done it yet.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.562
MAN:
Oh, and I suppose
you're gonna be the one?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.196
So far, your algorithm
has turned up jack.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.798
Josh, you wouldn't know
a recursive algorithm

06:37.831 --> 06:39.433
if it bit you on your asymptote.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.802
Uh, actually, if we go back

06:41.835 --> 06:43.437
to second-year astrophysics...

06:43.471 --> 06:44.838
Who taught the class?
Pretty sure it was me.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.206
Let's go back
to first year.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.041
Um, who got the
highest mark

06:48.075 --> 06:49.677
in advanced physics?
Excuse me. I'm gonna see

06:49.710 --> 06:51.845
if I can solve the, uh...
the two-body problem.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.213
(chuckles)
Two-body problem
is high school math, dude.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.882
I need to get...

07:03.491 --> 07:05.926
Hi.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.162
I see you remembered
your shoes.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.598
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.065
(laughs)

07:12.099 --> 07:13.501
I'm Liam.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.503
Jillian.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.506
So you're not MIT.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.673
Oh, is it that obvious,

07:19.707 --> 07:22.109
or should I wear a dunce cap
so people know?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.645
I just mean that, you know,
I haven't seen you around.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.080
And that event was
students and faculty only.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.116
Darius Tanz is the greatest mind
of our time.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.584
So I snuck in.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.885
Sue me.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.824
And what do you do when not
committing felonious trespass?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.027
Guess.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.762
Okay.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.198
Let's see. Um...

07:45.232 --> 07:48.636
I'll say you're a writer.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.670
Sci-fi, perhaps.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.171
Whoa. How did you know...?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.873
You're interested in
the future of mankind,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.575
but you're not an MIT student.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.209
You carry a notebook
with a quote

07:56.243 --> 07:59.813
from Asimov on the cover.
"Ideas Die Hard"?

07:59.847 --> 08:02.082
I extrapolated from a set
of known facts and got lucky.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.517
Honestly.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.053
You are quite an observant guy.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.755
Scientists need
to be observant.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.891
Especially when
investigating new phenomena.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.927
(laughs)

08:13.961 --> 08:15.629
And what about you?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.197
What kind of, uh,

08:17.230 --> 08:20.568
important save-the-world work
are you doing at MIT?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.536
I'm creating a live
model of the solar system

08:22.570 --> 08:24.805
in-in real time, based
on gravimetric data.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.140
(imitates air whooshing)

08:27.174 --> 08:29.109
I'm creating a map of space.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.744
Sounds impressive.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.145
How's it going?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.581
Anything worth
doing takes time.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.248
Oh, so, in other words...
Yeah.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.416
...it's not panning out?
(laughs)
It's not panning out.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.323
When you're passionate about
something, time means nothing.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.195
And you're passionate
about celestial mechanics?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.633
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.069
When two celestial bodies
cross paths, it can, uh...

08:56.103 --> 08:59.072
It can...

08:59.106 --> 09:02.042
change their
trajectories forever.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.046
* Maybe I'll leave,
maybe I'll stay... *

09:06.079 --> 09:08.248
So this is my apartment.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.684
I like it.
Yeah.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.752
* Anyway

09:11.785 --> 09:14.354
* If you don't shape up

09:14.387 --> 09:15.923
* I'll be an ex-pat...

09:15.956 --> 09:17.625
Magic.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.693
I don't usually do this.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.161
I don't, either.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.163
Are you sure about this?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.966
Yes means yes.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.306
(buzzing)

09:43.283 --> 09:45.218
(beeps)

09:49.690 --> 09:51.925
So that's how it is,

09:51.959 --> 09:54.061
MIT? Sneaking out?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.730
No, no, no, no, no, it's
not like that. My research.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.198
Yeah, your research
that hasn't generated

09:58.231 --> 10:00.734
anything in months?
Yes. No, I got a hit.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.672
I can't explain. Can I call you?
I'm gonna call you.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.675
You are amazing and beautiful.
I can't wait to read your stuff.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.678
I'm gonna call you,
I promise

10:13.180 --> 10:14.648
Professor Croft?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.049
(knocking continues)

10:16.083 --> 10:17.785
Professor Croft,
it's Liam.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.720
Liam.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.321
What the hell time is it?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.790
I got a hit.
You got a hit?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.792
Yeah.
I'm going back to bed,

10:24.825 --> 10:26.960
and if you're lucky, I won't
remember this in the morning.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.129
Sir, if I'm right, people need
to see this immediately.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.665
You've got friends at, uh...
in Washington, at NASA

10:31.699 --> 10:32.933
you can call, right?
Washington? What?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.401
Are you drunk?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.069
Sir, that hurts.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.738
Well, last month,
you woke me up with this theory

10:37.771 --> 10:39.339
that we're all living
in a fractal holographic matrix.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.440
Remember that?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.075
Well, yeah,
I-I may have had a few

10:42.109 --> 10:43.343
that night, sir,
but this is different.
Mmm.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.178
There's a significant
perturbation.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.014
Really?
I've been running continual

10:47.047 --> 10:48.849
simulations,
and there's something there

10:48.882 --> 10:50.350
that was not there
three months ago.
Well, you know,

10:50.383 --> 10:51.952
a slight miscalculation
could taint the results.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.787
Why don't you give me the data?
I'll take a look.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.255
Yes. It's-it's already
uploaded to your server.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.090
Okay. Good.
Well, go home, get some sleep.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.458
We'll discuss this after class,

10:58.491 --> 10:59.927
which starts
in about five hours.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.696
Try to be on time
for once, all right?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.765
Oh, my God.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.453
This is Malcolm Croft.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.456
Yes, I know it's late,
but this can't wait.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.892
And finally, there have been
some reports in the press

11:31.925 --> 11:34.061
and elsewhere concerning
movement of nuclear material.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.929
This is nothing more
than routine maintenance

11:35.963 --> 11:40.200
required to keep our arsenals
safe, secure and reliable. Yes.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.769
Grace, are you saying

11:41.802 --> 11:43.036
Russian concerns
are completely unfounded?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.371
That's exactly
what I'm saying, Russ.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.773
What kind of
routine maintenance

11:45.806 --> 11:47.207
requires moving nuclear weapons

11:47.240 --> 11:48.809
from the Utah desert

11:48.842 --> 11:51.144
to Florida?
Those missiles were due
to be retired.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.780
Nothing out of
the ordinary, Ms...?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.982
Amanda Neel,
Capitol Eyes News.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.117
And not according to my sources.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.518
Well, Amanda Neel
of Capitol Eyes News,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.253
you may need better sources.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.856
(laughter)
Moving on.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.192
We had one non-combat
related death in Germany.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.160
U.S. diplomat succumbed
to injuries sustained

12:07.194 --> 12:08.829
while visiting
Frankfurt.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.263
(bell tolls)

12:12.499 --> 12:14.167
STUDENT:
That's it.
15-minute rule.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.904
Croft's a no-show.
Let's get out of here.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.939
(students whoop, chatter)

12:35.555 --> 12:36.990
(door creaks open)

12:37.024 --> 12:40.060
(knocks lightly)

12:40.093 --> 12:42.095
Professor Croft?

12:57.945 --> 13:00.347
LIAM:
911?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.182
There has been...
has been a burglary,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.852
or a... or a kidnapping,
or I don't... I don't know what.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.586
But my professor-- he...

13:06.619 --> 13:09.122
His place is trashed,
and he didn't show up for class.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.958
He left his glasses behind.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.826
No.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.895
No. No, I'm not on drugs.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.999
I'm sorry, Operator.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.901
I got... I got to go.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.169
I...
(phone beeps off)

13:30.577 --> 13:33.380
(engine starts, revs)

13:38.485 --> 13:39.953
(engine revving)

13:52.900 --> 13:55.402
(engine revving)

13:55.435 --> 13:57.004
(tires screech)

14:05.278 --> 14:07.614
(piano plays classical music)

14:07.647 --> 14:09.950
(indistinct chatter)

14:09.983 --> 14:11.952
Yeah, the first
one is fine.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.386
Uh, from now on, they've got
to be approved by me, or...

14:13.420 --> 14:14.955
MAN:
Good afternoon, Mr. Tanz.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.156
Good afternoon.
We've got new people...

14:17.657 --> 14:19.092
...talking about it.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.494
(panting)

14:21.528 --> 14:24.097
Sir, my name's Liam Cole.
I'm a student at MIT.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.666
In 186 days, an asteroid's
gonna collide with Earth

14:26.699 --> 14:29.469
and we're
all gonna die.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.504
*

14:42.582 --> 14:46.086
My name is Liam Cole.
I'm a student at MIT.

14:46.119 --> 14:50.323
My ID is in my
wallet. It's...

14:50.357 --> 14:51.624
MAN:
MIT grad.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.193
Astrophysics.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.428
The shoeless guy.
Yes, sir.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.230
Did we have an appointment
with the shoeless guy?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.132
Whoa!

14:59.166 --> 15:03.203
Easy. I got a flash drive
in my pocket with all the data.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.375
(panting)

15:08.408 --> 15:09.709
I've been running simulations,

15:09.742 --> 15:11.344
trying to solve
the N-body problem.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.180
How asteroids, comets interact
with each other.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.283
Everybody at NASA is studying
NEOs we already know.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.319
I've been looking for the ones
we've missed, and I found one.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.425
I got the visuals here
if you want to take a look.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.095
(chirping)
Whoa.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.429
That's a holographic projector.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.664
Yeah, it's a little toy
I've been working on.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.135
Hope to have it in stores
by, um, Christmas 2020.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.304
If the world still exists.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.173
(trilling)

15:40.207 --> 15:42.642
Let's hear it. I'm listening.

15:42.675 --> 15:46.179
Okay, yeah, well, uh,
this is the solar system today.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.115
And, uh, excuse me.
If you don't mind...

15:48.148 --> 15:50.250
I do.
Um, and this...

15:50.283 --> 15:53.186
is the asteroid.
Let's call it "Rocky."

15:53.220 --> 15:54.354
It's about
300 million miles out.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.056
Now, my software,

15:56.089 --> 15:57.757
which I'm happy to sell to you,
by the way,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.493
predicts a trajectory for this
asteroid to collide with Earth,

16:00.527 --> 16:03.230
like I said, in 186 days.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.201
Given its location and
its orbital configuration,

16:08.235 --> 16:13.606
there is a 97.2% probability
that this is a planet killer.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.276
Okay.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.710
That's your supposition--
hardly proof

16:17.744 --> 16:19.346
that you or your data
are correct.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.048
No, I-I rechecked

16:21.081 --> 16:22.715
all my calculations last night.
They're solid.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.218
And I showed the numbers
to my advisor, Professor Croft.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.686
Five hours later,
he disappeared,

16:26.719 --> 16:28.188
and didn't show up for class.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.323
His place was trashed.
Trashed?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.791
There were big, scary goons
staking out his house.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.393
They chased my ass
across campus.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.694
Now either this is
an amazing coincidence,

16:34.727 --> 16:36.296
or I'm onto something

16:36.329 --> 16:38.265
that someone, somewhere,
doesn't want public.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.767
I'm telling you, Mr. Tanz,
the sky is falling.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.171
And you may be the only person
that can do something about it.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.175
Karissa, bring a car
and fuel the jet.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.111
Where are you going?
We're going. To Washington.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.320
(elevator bell dings)

17:00.353 --> 17:02.455
Okay, this is
the Pentagon.

17:02.489 --> 17:06.393
Wow. MIT is admitting
some big brains these days.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.800
He's expecting you,

17:13.833 --> 17:15.635
Mr. Tanz.
Sit. Wait.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.404
But...
Trust.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.244
HARRIS:
Darius.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.346
They told me
you were on your way over.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.747
Is there a problem?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.382
Well, I'm not
sure, Harris.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.750
It depends on whether

17:30.783 --> 17:32.319
a planet-killing asteroid
is heading our way.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.388
What are you talking about?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
Asteroid, Earth.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.491
(imitates explosion)
Boom!

17:38.525 --> 17:41.394
You run DOD point
for all things NASA.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.496
Okay, where are you getting
this science fiction from?

17:43.530 --> 17:44.497
So it's not true?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.266
No.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.302
Okay, then you won't mind me

17:49.336 --> 17:51.338
tweeting about an asteroid
poised to slam into Earth

17:51.371 --> 17:53.340
in, say, 186 days

17:53.373 --> 17:55.242
to my 20 million
Twitter followers?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.444
(phone buzzes)
Oh. Make that 21 million.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.146
Okay, Darius...

17:59.179 --> 18:00.613
So which is it?

18:00.647 --> 18:03.250
Science or fiction?

18:03.283 --> 18:06.519
(sighs)

18:06.553 --> 18:09.322
So those Goliath 2 rocket
engines you ordered from me

18:09.356 --> 18:11.291
on an accelerated timeline,
not exactly

18:11.324 --> 18:13.160
for communication satellites,
I take it.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.661
We have the brightest minds
working the problem...

18:14.694 --> 18:17.330
No, you don't,
because you're not using me.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.299
Oh, so what?
Without the great Darius Tanz,

18:19.332 --> 18:21.301
we're all doomed?
Is that it?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.470
The way I see it,
you've got two choices--

18:23.503 --> 18:26.173
tell me, or kill me.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.509
(door opens)

18:30.677 --> 18:32.345
I'm going down
to Joint Task Force.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.446
Have Grace Barrows
meet me there.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.548
Who are you?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.317
Liam Cole,

18:37.350 --> 18:38.318
MIT grad student, sir.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.486
TANZ: He arrived
at the same

18:39.519 --> 18:42.189
conclusion as NASA, but his
computer did it autonomously

18:42.222 --> 18:44.724
while he was
getting laid.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.597
Get Mr. Cole clearance. Now.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.501
(keyboard keys clicking rapidly)

18:56.436 --> 18:57.804
You wanted to see me?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.907
Darius Tanz, Grace Barrows,
DOD Public Affairs.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.509
Pleasure.
We've met before.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.377
Croatian Embassy.
Good memory.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.346
Photographic. It's
a curse, trust me.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.580
(elevator bell dings)
Liam Cole.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.416
He works for me.
I... I do.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.351
I work for him.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.386
Shall we?

19:22.695 --> 19:25.465
(elevator bell dings)

19:41.348 --> 19:44.417
(beeps, trills)

19:48.555 --> 19:51.758
HARRIS:
This is the command center
for Project Samson.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.427
Of the 30,000 people
who work in the Pentagon,

19:54.461 --> 19:56.363
fewer than 40
have clearance.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.930
COMPUTERIZED MALE VOICE:
Security and soundproof measures

19:57.964 --> 20:00.533
activated.
HARRIS:
Three months ago,

20:00.567 --> 20:01.968
through
the Safeguard Survey System

20:02.001 --> 20:05.305
that catalogues Near Earth
Objects, NASA astronomer

20:05.338 --> 20:08.508
Dr. Eduard Acosta discovered
an asteroid, Samson,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.977
seven kilometers wide,
out near Jupiter.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.846
Large enough to cause an
extinction-level event.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.649
Trajectory data has
now been firmed up,

20:16.683 --> 20:18.718
and the latest calculations
show that Samson has

20:18.751 --> 20:22.655
the potential to collide
with Earth in 186 days.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.957
Our simulations give
it a high probability of

20:24.991 --> 20:27.660
impact off the East Coast
of the United States.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.562
So that's why
you're moving those nukes.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.863
You think you're gonna
blow this fellow out of the sky.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.565
Well, nukes
won't work.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.636
Sorry, but even
if a nuclear explosion

20:36.669 --> 20:39.972
broke up the asteroid, it would
create thousands of meteors

20:40.006 --> 20:41.541
that would rain down on Earth,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.010
setting in motion cataclysmic
events all over the world.

20:44.043 --> 20:44.844
Thank you, Liam.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.613
No. He's right.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.515
It was explored, but
deemed too dangerous.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.551
We've been working
on impact prevention

20:51.584 --> 20:53.586
since Chelyabinsk,
back in 2013.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.922
That process has now
been expedited.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.691
So what is the plan,
if you don't mind me asking?

21:00.059 --> 21:02.629
This.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.930
A gravity tractor.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.765
(beeps)

21:05.798 --> 21:06.799
LIAM:
Oh, that would
deflect the asteroid

21:06.833 --> 21:08.568
using gravitational pull.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.571
Sorry.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.740
We position a probe

21:13.773 --> 21:15.608
next to the asteroid.
Even though its mass

21:15.642 --> 21:18.378
is small, the probe generates
its own gravitational field.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.613
Diverting the asteroid's path
just enough to miss Earth.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.549
But you need a rocket
powerful enough

21:22.582 --> 21:25.652
to get it there in time, and
that rocket doesn't exist yet.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.687
Well, actually, it does.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.757
We've modified one
of your rockets, the Goliath 2.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.560
The test phase is almost
complete. We launch next week.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.763
We have full confidence this
will take care of the problem,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.431
and no one will be the wiser.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.669
(elevator bell dings)

21:42.702 --> 21:45.638
I'm sure you understand why
this needs to remain classified.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.006
If the public were
to find out...

21:47.039 --> 21:48.808
Of course.
Anything you need.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.110
My entire company stands at
your disposal, ready to help.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.513
Ah, we'll take that
under advisement.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.048
Most important thing right now
is that we carry on

21:56.082 --> 21:57.684
business as usual.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.887
Liam.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.956
Will I see you tonight

22:03.990 --> 22:05.592
at the Embassy Ball?

22:05.625 --> 22:06.859
Absolutely.
How about you, Grace?

22:06.893 --> 22:09.028
Yes.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.563
Wouldn't miss it.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.965
Tonight, then.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.704
LIAM:
Business as usual?

22:17.737 --> 22:19.772
Do you own a tux?
No. Of course you don't.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.409
My professor is missing,
an asteroid is coming,

22:22.442 --> 22:24.444
and you're talking
about going to a party.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.645
Did you believe
anything he said in there

22:25.678 --> 22:27.146
about having it under control?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.616
Oh, we're not gonna wait
for the government to save us.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.750
We're gonna save ourselves.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.663
I know.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.698
It's a lot to take in.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.369
How long have you
been carrying this?

22:51.738 --> 22:52.772
Three months.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.976
So the nukes aren't undergoing
routine maintenance.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.611
If the gravity
tractor fails,

22:58.645 --> 23:00.947
they're the last line
of defense.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.049
But you're confident
this will work?

23:03.082 --> 23:04.717
Yes.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.118
Yes, Grace.

23:09.656 --> 23:12.191
Why are you telling me
this now? Why bring me in?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.193
Because the playing field
just changed.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.928
Information got into the wild.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.097
And you need me
to contain it.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.739
(sighs)

23:28.575 --> 23:29.909
I'm sorry.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.146
I never wanted
to burden you with this.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.518
You don't have to stay.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.456
I can't leave.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.492
Not now.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.762
But, Harris,
if I stay...

23:51.664 --> 23:53.466
...no more secrets.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.804
No more secrets.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.584
(phone dings, vibrates)

24:15.588 --> 24:16.889
(footsteps approaching)

24:16.923 --> 24:18.758
I'm heading out.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.860
I'm sleeping at Kira's.
It's not to avoid curfew.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.161
You look nice.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.163
Zoe, I just got a text
from your father

24:24.196 --> 24:25.665
about a gap year?

24:25.698 --> 24:28.167
Uh...

24:28.200 --> 24:30.069
I was gonna tell you.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.038
Tell me what?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.941
I applied to a community
outreach program in Kenya.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.943
It starts
in September.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.011
Africa? Uh, whoa-whoa...

24:39.045 --> 24:41.948
Okay. Wh-What about Duke?
They said I could
defer for a year.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.616
They were really cool about it.
Do you know how many
Americans were kidnapped

24:43.650 --> 24:45.685
last year abroad?
Oh, I knew you
were gonna say that.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.020
Mom, it's more dangerous to
drive a car than go to Africa.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.523
Honey, now is not the time.
You are the one who's
always telling me

24:50.557 --> 24:52.525
it's my responsibility
to contribute,
Yes. Yes.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.193
to help those less fortunate.
Yes. But not now!

24:54.226 --> 24:56.095
Mom. Look, I know
that this is scary

24:56.128 --> 24:58.865
for you-- letting go. But...

24:58.898 --> 25:01.233
you're not gonna be able to
make the world safe for me,

25:01.267 --> 25:03.502
so please, stop trying.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.273
(door opens)

25:08.340 --> 25:10.543
(door closes)

25:12.044 --> 25:14.046
(music playing)
(indistinct conversations)

25:27.326 --> 25:29.528
Thank you.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.066
(sighs)

25:34.100 --> 25:36.002
New York Times,
Washington Post--

25:36.035 --> 25:37.704
how am I supposed
to compete with that?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.171
Got to get creative.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.707
When you're the little fish,

25:40.740 --> 25:42.709
you see things
the big fish miss,

25:42.742 --> 25:44.911
'cause they're too busy
puckering up to other big fish.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.579
Whoa.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.649
Darius Tanz.
Always wanted to meet that guy.
Hey.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.584
Now that's where you're
missing the story.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.920
You're looking
at the wrong fish.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.822
Darius.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.224
So, uh, who are
all these people?

25:58.257 --> 26:01.193
Congressmen, diplomats, heads
of state, heads of corporations.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.195
Pretty much everyone
who's anyone,

26:03.229 --> 26:04.997
so that makes you...

26:05.031 --> 26:06.132
anyone.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.800
Oh, I'm... I'm honored.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.669
And this is all
part of your big plan, right?

26:09.702 --> 26:11.170
I'm here to make certain

26:11.203 --> 26:13.072
connections,
and, uh,

26:13.105 --> 26:15.942
you're here for the
free food. Enjoy.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.811
Great, I'll go visit with the
chairman of the joint chiefs.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.112
Try not to spill any wine

26:20.146 --> 26:22.915
or any national
security secrets.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.951
How you doing, sir?

26:27.654 --> 26:29.255
Do you mind if I steal
Ms. Barrows for a moment?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.823
Of course.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.292
Uh, it was nice seeing you.
(chuckles)

26:37.664 --> 26:39.231
Ironic, don't you think?
People drinking,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.033
celebrating, dancing.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.202
No idea that the world
is coming to an end.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.004
You heard what Harris said.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.172
They have a plan.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.674
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize

26:47.707 --> 26:49.275
you believed all
that crap in there.

26:49.308 --> 26:52.645
But I don't want to cause waves
between you and your boyfriend.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.781
W-What?
I'm good
at reading people.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.016
It's a gift and a curse.

26:57.049 --> 27:00.219
Well, your skills
are remedial, at best.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.022
I like you, Grace.
The way you handle yourself.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.757
You are extraordinary.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.726
In an ordinary way.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.028
Wow. (laughs)
Thank you.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.330
That's the worst compliment
I've ever gotten.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.199
Which makes it an insult,
actually.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.166
No, it's a gift.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.368
You're tough, loyal,
believable.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.071
People trust you even when
maybe they shouldn't.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.810
Darius, it was a pleasure.
Good night.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.345
Look, I've known
Harris Edwards for 15 years,

27:26.378 --> 27:28.347
ever since he was
a lowly captain at CENTCOM

27:28.380 --> 27:31.718
He's a patriot, but he's
also a bureaucrat.
Meaning?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.886
I don't think he's telling
either of us the whole truth.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.289
What if I told you that the
government's plan was bollocks,

27:37.323 --> 27:39.058
that I have a real plan,

27:39.091 --> 27:41.360
but I need someone
on the inside?

27:41.393 --> 27:43.696
And what is this plan?

27:45.131 --> 27:46.432
Are you up for some
show and tell?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.102
JILLIAN (on message machine):
This is Jillian.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.303
Leave a message.
Resistance is futile.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.840
(phone beeps)
Hi, Jillian, it's Liam.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.809
Uh, I'm sorry I disappeared.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.778
It's a long story, but, uh,

27:58.811 --> 28:00.379
I've been thinking
about you a lot.
(phone beeps)

28:00.412 --> 28:03.382
Disappeared on a girl?

28:03.415 --> 28:05.151
What does one make
of that?

28:05.184 --> 28:08.320
Uh, one makes
nothing of it,

28:08.354 --> 28:09.856
unless one's
eavesdropping, apparently.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.224
Well, that's what makes
these parties go 'round.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.160
So who are you?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.295
Me, I'm... I'm
just a nobody.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.464
That's a lot of tuxedo
for a nobody.

28:18.497 --> 28:21.300
All right, you got me, I'm
Darius' new head of security.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.836
More dangerous with weapons
or just your bare hands?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.838
You don't want
to test it, trust me.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.406
I'm Amanda.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.208
Liam.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.476
What brings you here, Amanda?

28:30.509 --> 28:33.379
Oh, I just snagged an invite
from a friend.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.181
I like to be where
the action is.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.216
Never know who you'll meet.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.517
(phone chimes)

28:38.550 --> 28:43.890
Uh, sorry, uh... my, uh...

28:43.923 --> 28:46.125
my ride's leaving.
I gotta go.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.259
Oh, I didn't catch
your last name, Liam.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.896
That's 'cause I didn't
give it to you.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.397
(chuckles)

28:51.430 --> 28:54.033
Hey, if you ever
want to chat

28:54.066 --> 28:56.068
or hang out, give a ring.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.439
Sure.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.322
(camera shutter clicks)

29:18.891 --> 29:21.427
LIAM:
Tanz Industries.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.996
This place is legendary.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.364
DARIUS:
Ten miles from D.C.,

29:25.397 --> 29:27.900
but a world away--
my home away from home.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.804
Welcome to the Treehouse.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.040
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Hello, Darius.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.875
I had a treehouse
growing up,

29:35.908 --> 29:37.343
and it looked
nothing like this.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.846
Anything and everything
you can dream up,

29:39.879 --> 29:42.081
you can design
and build it here.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.016
An inspiration factory.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.485
Willy Wonka,
without the Oompa-Loompas

29:46.518 --> 29:50.222
GRACE: Okay, you win man cave
of the universe award.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.457
What was so important
it couldn't wait?

29:51.490 --> 29:54.226
Tess, please run program T6.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.527
TESS (computer voice):
Program T6 loaded.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.397
DARIUS:
Playback.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.199
What are we looking at?

30:00.232 --> 30:04.203
This is RIVA: my Reusable
Interplanetary Vehicle,

30:04.236 --> 30:06.505
designed to be a cargo
transport to Mars.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.008
How is that gonna
stop a meteor?

30:09.041 --> 30:10.542
It's not.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.446
We're re-purposing it...

30:14.480 --> 30:17.349
as a lifeboat--
this is an ark, Grace.

30:17.383 --> 30:21.553
It's gonna save the human race
from... extinction.

30:31.230 --> 30:35.401
You're planning for the
extinction of the human race?

30:35.434 --> 30:39.138
No, I'm planning for the
continuation of the human race.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.273
Have you ever heard
of the concept "MVP"--

30:41.307 --> 30:42.875
minimal viable population?

30:42.909 --> 30:44.510
Each species has a threshold.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.312
The minimum number
of individuals required

30:46.345 --> 30:49.115
to prevent extinction
DARIUS: Exactly.

30:49.148 --> 30:52.184
DARIUS: For humans, that
number is 160 saved.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.586
Just 160 well-chosen souls

30:54.620 --> 30:56.255
save the species.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.157
So your plan is
to make a getaway

30:58.190 --> 31:02.061
on a spaceship with
160 of your besties

31:02.094 --> 31:03.529
and fly to Mars?

31:03.562 --> 31:05.031
Well, we might have to orbit
for a while

31:05.064 --> 31:06.398
until we set up shop.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.267
This was supposed to be
a seven-year plan.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.601
I'm accelerating it.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.537
I'm sorry, this is...
Nuts.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.972
GRACE: You're betting on
the government to fail.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.440
I'm not.
I don't make bets.

31:14.473 --> 31:17.109
I make calculated decisions
based on facts,

31:17.143 --> 31:19.011
and the fact is the government's
plan won't work.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.048
They need technology that
hasn't been invented yet.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.582
They won't tell you that,
of course.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.184
Or maybe they haven't even
figured that part out yet.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.519
Why did you bring me here,
Darius?

31:27.553 --> 31:32.624
If I can expedite production,
make a dozen RIVAs or more,

31:32.658 --> 31:35.527
instead of 160 people,
maybe I can save thousands.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.597
But I need access to
information and resources

31:38.630 --> 31:40.032
that only a few people
in the government have.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.534
I need an inside man.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.470
Or woman, as they say.

31:44.503 --> 31:48.140
You're asking me
to divert resources,

31:48.174 --> 31:50.109
spy on my government,

31:50.142 --> 31:52.311
commit treason for some

31:52.344 --> 31:55.181
insane narcissistic
suicide mission?

31:55.214 --> 31:58.284
The only suicide mission
is wearing blinders, Grace.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.386
Harris assured me
that they...

32:00.419 --> 32:03.322
Harris will trot you out
to deliver his lies,

32:03.355 --> 32:05.157
the masses will believe you,

32:05.191 --> 32:07.059
and no one will be prepared
for what's coming

32:07.093 --> 32:09.395
except for me and the people
on this list.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.733
I don't want to save
160 people.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.168
I want to save everyone.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.221
Look, man, I, uh...

32:35.254 --> 32:37.356
I want to help you, but

32:37.389 --> 32:39.325
there's this girl up in Boston,

32:39.358 --> 32:41.593
and if this is really
the end, I guess I, uh,

32:41.627 --> 32:44.696
I wanna live before I die.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.766
Karissa, get the plane ready.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.570
No, I'll, uh... I'll
take the train, thanks.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.651
Is he available?
He's not in,
Ms. Barrows.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.120
Oh, I didn't see anything
on the schedule.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.988
I expect him back
early this evening.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.251
JILLIAN:
So you were with Darius

33:39.285 --> 33:41.253
Tanz at a ball in

33:41.287 --> 33:43.222
Washington, D.C.?
More of a reception.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.224
Yeah, I wasn't
blowing you off, I swear.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.793
No, but he had offered you
a job, and you said, "No."

33:47.826 --> 33:49.461
Why?

33:49.495 --> 33:55.201
Well, uh, because I have
unfinished business here.

33:55.234 --> 33:58.237
Anyway, what's going on
with you? Tell me about you.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.540
I actually got some really
good news yesterday.

34:01.573 --> 34:05.311
Yeah?
Yeah, this publisher liked
one of my short stories.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.246
That's fantastic!
Yeah.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.614
What's it about?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.716
What else? The future.

34:10.749 --> 34:14.353
(laughs)

34:15.754 --> 34:17.323
Hey, let's take a road trip.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.259
What?
Yeah, I want to spend
all my time with you,

34:20.292 --> 34:22.161
travel, see the world
before it's too late.

34:22.194 --> 34:25.764
What about your research?
Screw my research.
I want to have fun,

34:25.797 --> 34:27.499
enjoy life.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.102
* A dumb feeling
that I'm needing love *

34:30.136 --> 34:34.606
* Just cover your eyes
and call me pretty please *

34:34.640 --> 34:38.810
* Just call me pretty please,
just call me pretty *

34:38.844 --> 34:42.248
* Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

34:42.281 --> 34:48.287
* Call me pretty please,
just call me pretty... *

34:48.320 --> 34:51.357
(high-pitched tone,
distorted sounds)

34:54.326 --> 34:57.196
(normal sounds resume)

34:57.229 --> 34:59.365
Sorry.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.633
Hey, hey, hey,
Liam, maybe we should go home.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.302
No, no, the night is young.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.836
I want to live before I...

35:04.870 --> 35:07.706
Hey. You got a
problem, old man?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.741
Yeah. You.

35:09.775 --> 35:10.909
(grunts)

35:10.942 --> 35:12.244
HARRIS:
Yes, sir,

35:12.278 --> 35:14.146
all the information
will be sent your way.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.617
(knocking)
Hey.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.386
What are you
still doing here?
Oh, I had

35:20.419 --> 35:22.221
a few things
to get out the door.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.791
Where have you been?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.462
Harris, you got
to keep me in the loop.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.431
Otherwise, I can't do my job.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.266
Yeah.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.408
There was a burn test today
of the Goliath 2 rocket engine.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.410
The one being used
to launch the gravity tractor?

35:44.443 --> 35:46.545
Mm-hmm.
And how'd it go?

35:46.578 --> 35:49.281
We're right on schedule.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.350
Oh, that's fantastic.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.452
Yeah.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.687
(sighs)
Fantastic.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.295
Hey, Carn.
Hey.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.830
How's the night shift?

36:04.863 --> 36:06.565
Oh, it's a barrel of laughs.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.434
(laughs)

36:08.467 --> 36:10.736
I need to see satellite
imagery from Wallops Island

36:10.769 --> 36:12.404
from around 2:00
this afternoon.

36:12.438 --> 36:15.874
Uh, Grace, this is the Pentagon,
not Best Buy.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.376
No uplinks without clearance,

36:17.409 --> 36:18.844
or an approved
telemetry request.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.446
Clearance I have.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.248
It's time I'm short on.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.982
(Grace sighs)

36:24.015 --> 36:26.985
Remember when you broke
your ankle playing softball?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.487
How long before your
request for a closer

36:28.520 --> 36:29.921
parking spot went through?

36:29.955 --> 36:31.490
All I'm asking is to

36:31.523 --> 36:33.259
cut through
a little red tape.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.261
You're gonna owe me for this.

36:35.294 --> 36:39.498
Nats tickets, box seats,
right behind the dugout.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.235
(sighs)
Okay.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.237
(keyboard keys clicking rapidly)

36:45.271 --> 36:48.540
(computer chirps)

36:48.574 --> 36:50.409
What are we looking at?

36:50.442 --> 36:54.546
Fragments of a Tanz
Goliath 2 rocket.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.415
Can you back it up?

36:56.448 --> 36:58.250
Uh...
(computer chirps)

36:58.284 --> 37:02.388
Not sure what they were testing,
but I'd say they failed.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.290
With flying colors.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.301
Shut it down, Carn.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.201
Is-is everything okay?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.504
I'll have those Nats tickets
for you stat.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.606
All right.

37:20.639 --> 37:21.473
(door opens)

37:23.409 --> 37:25.377
(door closes)

37:32.718 --> 37:35.454
(rhythmic beeping)
What the...

37:35.487 --> 37:37.889
(keyboard keys clicking rapidly)

37:37.923 --> 37:40.559
(computer clicking
and whirring)

38:06.785 --> 38:08.387
Hey.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.789
Hey.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.927
You putting final
touches on the speech?

38:15.961 --> 38:17.863
Yeah.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.033
Zoe.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.871
I'm sorry.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.610
You're right. I can't make
the world safe for you.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.783
It's your life.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.419
I want you to live it.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.489
Mom, are you all right?

38:43.522 --> 38:45.724
Yeah. Yeah.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.960
I just love you.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.697
I know.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.548
Thank you.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.121
You see that?

39:16.154 --> 39:18.924
That is Mars
at perigee.

39:18.957 --> 39:22.728
It's as close
as it's gonna get all year.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.632
I don't usually
drink like that.

39:26.665 --> 39:29.468
Then why did you?

39:32.638 --> 39:33.939
Can I ask you something?

39:33.972 --> 39:35.641
Mm-hmm.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.943
If you were writing
a story about a...

39:37.976 --> 39:41.547
a guy who knew the world
was coming to an end,

39:41.580 --> 39:44.816
and he could either
save a couple thousand people

39:44.850 --> 39:48.820
or live the rest of his days
with a beautiful woman,

39:48.854 --> 39:51.457
what would you have him do?

39:51.490 --> 39:53.124
It depends.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.961
Is the character supposed
to be a hero

39:55.994 --> 39:58.163
or a loser?
(chuckles)

39:58.196 --> 39:59.798
Ow.

39:59.831 --> 40:03.134
Uh...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.170
a hero.

40:05.203 --> 40:09.174
Well, then he has to
sacrifice his happiness

40:09.207 --> 40:11.577
for the sake of humanity.

40:13.044 --> 40:17.983
Even if he thinks
he's in love with the woman?

40:18.016 --> 40:21.487
Mm, especially if he is.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.555
Then it's a true sacrifice.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.533
Tell me more
about the stars.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.869
(soft chuckle)

40:37.903 --> 40:39.505
The stars, okay.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.840
Uh...
(grunts)

40:41.873 --> 40:46.678
That's Sirius,
aka the dog star.

40:47.713 --> 40:51.483
It's the brightest star
in the sky.

40:51.517 --> 40:54.019
And then up here,
see this one up here?

40:56.688 --> 41:00.125
Class of 2017, it is an honor

41:00.158 --> 41:02.694
to be able to address you all
here today.

41:02.728 --> 41:06.197
The future is not
just handed to us.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.967
We create it.

41:20.946 --> 41:24.082
Life is filled
with possibilities.

41:24.115 --> 41:28.654
There is no tomorrow
without us.

41:28.687 --> 41:33.124
My mother taught me
at a young age,

41:33.158 --> 41:37.663
that as individuals,
we are powerful.

41:41.633 --> 41:45.571
How we use that power
is up to us.

41:52.644 --> 41:56.715
I dreaded all the emotion of
saying good-bye to my friends,

41:56.748 --> 41:57.849
my family.

41:57.883 --> 42:00.118
As exciting as the future is...

42:00.151 --> 42:02.120
(distant clatter)

42:02.153 --> 42:04.189
...it's also scary.

42:08.594 --> 42:11.162
It's the unknown.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.164
Hello?

42:13.198 --> 42:17.569
But then I started realizing
this isn't the end,

42:17.603 --> 42:19.638
this is just the beginning.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.739
(silenced gunshot)

42:20.772 --> 42:24.943
My challenge
for the class of 2017?

42:24.976 --> 42:26.678
Make a difference.

42:26.712 --> 42:30.081
There are problems big and small
that need to be solved

42:30.115 --> 42:34.720
and we can't wait
for someone else to solve them.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.722
It's up to us now.

42:36.755 --> 42:40.058
(elevator doors open)

42:43.929 --> 42:45.631
Screw you and your ark.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.067
Nice to see you, too.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.738
You're right, Darius.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.039
The government's plan
won't work.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.941
They need you.

42:55.974 --> 42:58.777
You said the technology
doesn't exist yet.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.079
If you're so damn smart,
invent it.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.715
You've got the resources,
the talent, the money.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.652
Don't save 160 people,
save them all.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.720
Every last one.

43:08.754 --> 43:11.289
Come work with us.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.660
Let's do this together.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.162
I will do whatever it takes.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.831
I'll roll through red tape,
whatever you need from me,

43:19.865 --> 43:22.701
but, damn it, my daughter
deserves a future.

43:22.734 --> 43:23.769
They all do.

43:26.171 --> 43:28.073
And I'm not ready
for all of this to end.

43:28.106 --> 43:31.209
Grace...

43:31.242 --> 43:34.646
y-you had me at "screw you."

43:39.217 --> 43:40.652
Hi.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.724
Where can I put my stuff?

43:51.797 --> 43:53.732
ZOE: In the words of the great
humanitarian Mother Theresa:

43:53.765 --> 43:55.834
"Yesterday is gone.

43:55.867 --> 43:58.770
"Tomorrow has not yet come.

43:58.804 --> 43:59.938
"We have only today.

43:59.971 --> 44:03.408
So, let us begin."

44:03.441 --> 44:05.643
(applause)

44:06.845 --> 44:08.780
(cheering and whistling)

44:08.814 --> 44:10.015
(students cheer)
