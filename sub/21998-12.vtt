Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.759 --> 00:03.577
All your children
you love equally, right?

00:03.602 --> 00:05.101
- I do love all my children equally.
- Yeah, I'm sure

00:05.103 --> 00:06.632
that you do. Just admit
that you love Randall more.

00:06.657 --> 00:08.125
No, he was just easier!

00:08.469 --> 00:10.176
I married my best friend's wife.

00:10.201 --> 00:13.554
I've been on the outside of
this family since I entered it.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.665
You're gone all day, every day.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.557
- Where do you go?
- I have a cat.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.449
I go back and forth to feed him.

00:19.474 --> 00:22.127
His name's Clooney.
One of those ironic names,

00:22.152 --> 00:23.906
'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.060
How goes the entertainment
center that Jack built?

01:23.085 --> 01:25.101
Oh, it's gonna be great.

01:25.289 --> 01:28.279
I'm gonna give you an entire
shelf for all your records.

01:28.304 --> 01:29.406
Ooh, I love it.

01:29.431 --> 01:30.789
I've got another shelf

01:31.046 --> 01:32.393
that's gonna be for your phonograph.

01:32.418 --> 01:33.664
Oh, whatever.

01:33.891 --> 01:36.179
- You love my records.
- Yeah. I do love your records.

01:36.204 --> 01:37.234
Mm-hmm.

01:38.172 --> 01:40.320
Oh, gross. Act more like parents.

01:41.086 --> 01:43.287
Um, my friends and I are gonna go

01:43.312 --> 01:45.250
to the winter formal, so I need a dress.

01:45.275 --> 01:47.703
Um, Mom, do you think
we could go to the mall?

01:49.469 --> 01:50.664
Yeah.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.187
Yeah, yeah. We can do that.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.429
Uh, can you give me 20 minutes?

01:54.544 --> 01:55.648
Yeah.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.890
Come on, Louis. Come on, boy.

02:00.484 --> 02:02.251
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Did that just happen?

02:02.320 --> 02:04.742
Did my teenage daughter just ask
me to go to the mall with her?

02:04.767 --> 02:06.533
Sure did. Saw it with my own two eyes.

02:06.891 --> 02:08.734
Hey, babe, you mind if I go with you?

02:08.758 --> 02:10.007
I need to look at some suits.

02:10.032 --> 02:13.375
Walter wants us to "step up our game,"

02:13.400 --> 02:15.397
land a few more luxury condos.

02:15.578 --> 02:17.032
- Walter. Ech.
- Yeah.

02:17.101 --> 02:19.101
"Ech" should definitely be
that guy's last name.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.837
Oh, can you remind me
to pick up batteries?

02:21.906 --> 02:23.131
- Yeah. Got it. Yeah.
- Okay.

02:23.156 --> 02:25.093
Mom, Dad, I need more soda.

02:25.742 --> 02:27.117
- I got it.
- Okay.

02:28.492 --> 02:30.579
Hey, your mom is taking Kate to the mall

02:30.648 --> 02:32.181
to get a dress for the winter formal.

02:32.249 --> 02:33.992
Are you bringing Sophie to that?

02:34.617 --> 02:35.687
No.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.214
She doesn't really care if we go.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.851
Um, she's aware that I can't
exactly dance. You know?

02:40.919 --> 02:43.164
Can't dance, can't walk,
can't play football.

02:43.351 --> 02:44.921
- Where? Where do we get...
- Look out!

02:44.990 --> 02:46.320
What? What?

02:46.345 --> 02:48.265
- D-Dad, it's the best part.
- Come on.

02:48.290 --> 02:50.101
Quit moping. We're gonna go
to the mall, get you a new suit.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.326
Mall? I want to go to the mall.

02:53.231 --> 02:54.367
Great.

02:57.164 --> 02:58.264
God, he's weird.

02:58.289 --> 02:59.929
Get dressed. Come on.

03:23.968 --> 03:25.328
There you go, little man.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.851
You are now ready
for the great migration.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.166
Be safe out there.

03:31.203 --> 03:33.796
This diorama is gonna crush
the competition.

03:33.821 --> 03:36.222
I understand. Mm-hmm.

03:36.462 --> 03:38.000
All right.

03:38.025 --> 03:39.726
- Dang it.
- What?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.937
I just lost the lot on Clinton Avenue.

03:42.459 --> 03:44.392
The city just sold it to a Costco.

03:44.570 --> 03:46.265
So much for building a beautiful park

03:46.290 --> 03:48.356
for the hardworking people
of Trenton, New Jersey.

03:48.381 --> 03:49.593
Now they get a Costco.

03:49.618 --> 03:51.414
I'd rather have a Costco there than a...

03:51.439 --> 03:52.359
Shh.

03:53.398 --> 03:54.730
I'm so sorry, wife.

03:54.798 --> 03:56.687
I know how hard you worked on that.

03:56.858 --> 03:58.692
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.765
Um, you sure you're gonna have
enough time to drop the girls, and...

04:07.078 --> 04:08.545
go all the way to William's place,

04:08.570 --> 04:10.156
then make it back in time
for your job interview?

04:10.181 --> 04:11.695
Mm-hmm. I got time.

04:13.109 --> 04:15.570
Wouldn't rather spend that time
preparing for the interview,

04:15.595 --> 04:18.351
than going to William's
to pick up some random box

04:18.375 --> 04:20.053
they found in an old storage unit?

04:20.079 --> 04:21.937
No. I don't need to prepare.

04:21.968 --> 04:23.484
Keller's been after me for weeks.

04:23.656 --> 04:25.089
It's not getting me excited.

04:25.157 --> 04:27.091
Being a foster parent,
now that got me excited.

04:27.159 --> 04:29.293
I know, Randall.
And we're back on the list,

04:29.362 --> 04:30.674
but in the meantime,
why don't you just...

04:30.699 --> 04:32.496
In the meantime, I'm gonna wait
for something to come along

04:32.565 --> 04:35.039
that gets my juices flowing
in the same way.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.968
But you're-you're gonna go
to the job interview, right?

04:38.265 --> 04:39.570
I'll go.

04:39.939 --> 04:43.414
But I'm telling you now, ain't
doing nothing for my juices.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.111
And so, I fell off the wagon.

04:47.179 --> 04:48.304
Hard.

04:50.593 --> 04:53.651
You know, after the miscarriage,

04:53.953 --> 04:56.854
I just needed some comfort, you know?

04:57.593 --> 04:59.523
So I found that in Taco Bell.

05:00.007 --> 05:01.789
The Dorito shells are back, so...

05:03.140 --> 05:06.029
But now I'm on track,
and I'm going to double down,

05:06.054 --> 05:10.367
because Toby and I are getting
married in the spring.

05:10.789 --> 05:13.648
Yeah. And he's so friggin' romantic,

05:13.953 --> 05:16.771
he convinced me that I want
the all-out traditional wedding,

05:16.796 --> 05:19.781
which means the all-out
traditional wedding dress.

05:20.461 --> 05:22.148
Which doesn't exist for me.

05:22.730 --> 05:25.679
But it's okay, 'cause it's-it's
just gonna be a hurdle for me.

05:25.996 --> 05:27.992
It's just... it's just a hurdle.

05:28.489 --> 05:29.585
So...

05:30.953 --> 05:32.679
Anyway, enough about me.

05:32.704 --> 05:34.195
Madison, why don't you say something

05:34.220 --> 05:36.007
that makes us all roll our eyes,

05:36.032 --> 05:38.648
or... something.

05:38.868 --> 05:40.679
I think my wrists are getting fat.

05:43.008 --> 05:44.757
You know what?
I'm very proud of you, Kevin.

05:44.982 --> 05:46.562
You've made the most of your time here.

05:46.642 --> 05:47.941
Well, thank you, Babs.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.693
That means a lot...
I can call you Babs, right?

05:49.718 --> 05:51.078
- Still no.
- We're not there yet?

05:51.147 --> 05:52.913
- No. But...
- Okay.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.421
In here is in here, but out there,

05:55.671 --> 05:58.437
there are 86,400 seconds in a day.

05:59.757 --> 06:01.155
Did you steal that from Rent?

06:02.055 --> 06:03.722
No. My point being, is that

06:03.790 --> 06:05.924
it just takes one second to slip up.

06:05.993 --> 06:08.195
- Yeah.
- And that's why I'm a little bit worried

06:08.220 --> 06:10.335
about you going back
to Hollywood too quickly.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.187
I mean, you need structure,
you need a healthy routine.

06:14.023 --> 06:15.600
- You're right. You're right.
- Mm-hmm.

06:15.669 --> 06:19.312
It's exactly why I know
where I need to be.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.382
Um...

06:22.506 --> 06:26.541
My mom, um... a lot came out

06:26.968 --> 06:28.257
when she was here.

06:30.335 --> 06:32.203
And I figured this could be
a chance for us

06:32.228 --> 06:33.968
to make up for lost time.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.210
Good for both of us.

06:38.174 --> 06:39.593
There's one small problem.

06:40.078 --> 06:42.257
Kev! You made it. Welcome.

06:42.596 --> 06:44.562
- How was the trip?
- Oh, good.

06:45.094 --> 06:46.640
Good. You look great.

06:50.234 --> 06:53.054
So I got you organic bananas,

06:53.289 --> 06:56.046
and raw cashews. And, uh...

06:56.071 --> 06:59.820
I've got kale, so much kale. In fact,

07:00.132 --> 07:03.031
the woman at the grocery store
asked me what I was gonna do

07:03.056 --> 07:04.984
with all this kale, and I said,
"You know what, my son

07:05.009 --> 07:07.664
is coming to town,
and he's crazy about kale."

07:10.500 --> 07:13.203
Well, yeah, yeah, no, normally,
I-I would be,

07:13.228 --> 07:15.386
but, uh, I've actually switched, Mom,

07:15.411 --> 07:16.611
I've switched to a strict diet

07:16.679 --> 07:18.859
- of Skittles and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
- Oh.

07:18.884 --> 07:20.419
Because, uh... well, my therapist said

07:20.431 --> 07:22.140
it's okay to go nuts on sugar right now.

07:22.165 --> 07:24.101
But I can... I can, I can
go to the grocery store,

07:24.126 --> 07:25.289
and get some of that stuff later.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.078
Oh, no. We, uh, we could go together,

07:28.383 --> 07:29.816
to the grocery store.

07:29.931 --> 07:31.367
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.789
Yeah, I never thought...
that's great. Um...

07:33.953 --> 07:35.597
I need a schedule, right?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.389
I'm supposed to stick to it, so...

07:37.414 --> 07:40.123
this is good. Yeah, Mondays,
I go to the grocery store

07:40.148 --> 07:41.648
- with Mom.
- Mm.

07:42.828 --> 07:44.717
I can't believe
I used to date Jessica Biel.

07:44.742 --> 07:47.467
- Oh, I like her.
- That's... Yeah. Yeah, she's cute.

07:47.492 --> 07:48.906
You know, I think I'll tag along.

07:49.476 --> 07:52.023
- Okay. Sounds like a plan.
- Yeah.

07:53.980 --> 07:56.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:56.087 --> 07:57.703
I'm really sorry about what happened.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.121
With the baby.

07:59.861 --> 08:01.078
Thank you.

08:02.195 --> 08:03.192
Okay.

08:03.226 --> 08:04.709
So now I'm gonna propose something,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.241
- and before you say no...
- No.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.299
I am taking you wedding dress shopping.

08:08.468 --> 08:09.859
Oh, that's a hard no.

08:09.884 --> 08:12.592
Kate, come on. I know the perfect place.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.305
They-they do custom dresses.

08:14.374 --> 08:15.960
You don't have to try anything on.

08:15.985 --> 08:19.716
You just have to sip champagne
and-and talk about silhouettes,

08:19.741 --> 08:21.695
and you'll be treated like a princess.

08:24.984 --> 08:26.982
- I don't have to try anything on?
- Nothing.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.890
I promise I can make this
a nice thing for you.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.914
The moment you're at all
uncomfortable, we leave.

08:33.195 --> 08:35.687
No hesitation, no questions.

08:37.248 --> 08:39.171
Let me help you clear this hurdle.

08:57.335 --> 08:58.725
Oh, okay.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.343
Yeah. That is the dress.

09:00.950 --> 09:03.328
I mean, with your eyes, Kate? Oof...

09:06.398 --> 09:08.318
Sometimes brands run big or whatever,

09:08.343 --> 09:09.967
- so it's hard to know what size...
- Yeah.

09:09.992 --> 09:11.401
No, I do the same thing.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.859
Yeah.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.123
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Okay.

09:15.148 --> 09:16.343
Try and stay out of trouble.

09:16.368 --> 09:17.453
I will do my best.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.203
Can I help you find something?

09:22.461 --> 09:24.328
I'm just waiting for my daughter.

09:24.673 --> 09:26.039
We're shopping together.

09:27.171 --> 09:29.204
Okay, so we're right here, and...

09:29.750 --> 09:32.710
the suit shop...
the suit shop is right there.

09:32.735 --> 09:33.819
And Miguel's right there.

09:33.888 --> 09:35.429
Miguel! Hey!

09:36.590 --> 09:38.687
- Hey. What's going on?
- Hey, Jack, Kevin.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.426
Hey. Let me guess:

09:40.451 --> 09:41.984
you're, uh, getting some suits

09:42.009 --> 09:43.250
to keep Walter off your back.

09:43.275 --> 09:45.281
Yep. And one for Kevin, too,

09:45.306 --> 09:46.859
- for his winter formal.
- Oh.

09:46.884 --> 09:48.283
Yeah. What'd you get?

09:48.859 --> 09:52.404
Uh, a really overpriced
memory foam pillow...

09:52.429 --> 09:54.078
- Ah.
- ...just to cheer myself up.

09:54.945 --> 09:57.833
Shelly's boyfriend proposed
to her last night.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.812
Oof, I'm sorry.

09:59.837 --> 10:01.103
He did it on a ski trip.

10:01.338 --> 10:02.571
And the kids were there, too.

10:03.054 --> 10:04.984
- I guess they ski now.
- Hey.

10:05.226 --> 10:07.509
You're always gonna be
their dad, no matter what.

10:07.578 --> 10:09.478
- Okay? All right?
- Classic.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.513
What?

10:11.582 --> 10:13.093
You just always do that.

10:13.118 --> 10:15.507
You know? You always go straight
into a big pep talk.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.229
I think, sometimes, you just need

10:17.254 --> 10:18.765
a little bit of time to let things suck.

10:18.948 --> 10:19.981
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:20.226 --> 10:22.394
Well, I mean, he's got a...
he's got a point, Jack.

10:22.419 --> 10:23.843
I mean, sometimes,
a guy just wants to...

10:24.093 --> 10:26.539
to be bummed about crappy things.

10:27.179 --> 10:28.451
Yeah.

10:28.476 --> 10:29.865
Okay, fine.

10:30.348 --> 10:31.613
I can wallow.

10:33.171 --> 10:34.304
What do you guys want?

10:34.441 --> 10:35.820
Arcade or food court?

10:36.406 --> 10:37.656
- Food court.
- Food court.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.445
- All right, lead the way, Hopalong.
- This guy's like

10:40.514 --> 10:42.380
- a foot taller than me, too.
- Don't worry about it.

11:39.578 --> 11:40.591
Lloyd?

11:40.616 --> 11:41.748
I'm Randall Pearson.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.475
You, uh, you called me about a box.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.953
I know William's son when I see him.

11:46.125 --> 11:48.263
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you, sir.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.539
Yeah, sorry for the cold.

11:50.656 --> 11:52.867
Damn super won't fix the heat. Here.

11:52.936 --> 11:54.636
- Ah. There you go.
- This is it?

11:54.661 --> 11:56.101
- Yeah, this is it.
- Gotcha.

11:56.429 --> 11:57.632
Huh.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.570
Well, I-I guess that's it then.

12:02.719 --> 12:04.185
Mm-hmm.

12:04.914 --> 12:06.390
It was nice to meet you, Lloyd.

12:06.415 --> 12:07.890
- All right, yeah.
- All right.

12:09.156 --> 12:10.398
I'm sorry.

12:10.445 --> 12:13.346
Were you the neighbor who took
care of his cat, Clooney?

12:13.371 --> 12:15.779
Yes, but he took off a few weeks ago,

12:15.804 --> 12:18.460
probably once he realized
William wasn't coming back.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.662
I'm sure he's fine, though.

12:20.687 --> 12:23.271
Strays always end up
with someone who needs them.

12:23.339 --> 12:24.578
Yes, they do.

12:24.974 --> 12:26.289
Have a nice day, sir.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.687
My Lady, my Love, my Neighbor.

13:10.445 --> 13:13.093
Lady, I am straight up fixed on you,

13:13.406 --> 13:16.429
just as you sit, fixed straight on me.

13:17.193 --> 13:19.367
Our glue has long been set.

13:20.429 --> 13:23.375
Each morning I wake up and
head straight towards you.

13:23.773 --> 13:26.607
And each afternoon we sit
together with your children

13:26.632 --> 13:28.250
and watch the world go dark.

13:30.702 --> 13:33.210
Always I walk the same steps.

13:33.391 --> 13:34.812
I push open the door.

13:35.116 --> 13:37.414
I end up in front of you.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.695
Always you, my love.

13:42.835 --> 13:45.140
Always you, my Lady.

13:53.219 --> 13:55.090
Ah, Cookie Crisp. What?

13:55.115 --> 13:56.937
I haven't had Cookie Crisp
in, like, forever.

13:57.523 --> 14:00.421
Hey, do you remember, um,
do you remember when Dad

14:00.446 --> 14:02.784
used to take the entire
cereal box and he would just

14:02.786 --> 14:05.335
dump the whole sucker out
so that he could get the toy?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.222
Right? Before Randall and I
had a chance to fight over it.

14:07.224 --> 14:08.789
- Do you remember that?
- Aw, I do.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.343
- Ah.
- Hmm.

14:16.962 --> 14:18.546
I lost Dad's necklace.

14:19.603 --> 14:20.804
What?

14:22.239 --> 14:24.429
I tried to get it back and I-I couldn't.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.000
It's gone.

14:30.921 --> 14:32.500
Well, he would understand.

14:32.546 --> 14:34.315
You've been through a lot lately.

14:34.493 --> 14:36.084
- I don't know.
- I do.

14:39.990 --> 14:41.820
- You know what's funny?
- Hmm?

14:41.845 --> 14:45.827
Um, you beat yourself up
about losing your necklace

14:45.896 --> 14:50.562
and I beat myself up because
I can't seem to take mine off.

14:59.703 --> 15:00.937
Apricot.

15:01.312 --> 15:03.606
- They have apricot LaCroix.
- Yeah.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.062
Usually when I'm
bummed, I watch football.

15:08.087 --> 15:08.984
Mm-hmm.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.351
But now when I watch
football, I just think about

15:11.376 --> 15:13.109
- how I'll never play football.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.134 --> 15:14.953
That's a catch-22 right there, man.

15:14.978 --> 15:16.750
- What's that?
- It's an expression.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.373
It's from a book.

15:18.398 --> 15:20.171
Shelly was always trying to
get me to read more books.

15:20.196 --> 15:21.609
There's Randall. Randall! Hey!

15:22.266 --> 15:25.179
Finally. A breath of fresh air.

15:28.004 --> 15:29.187
Or not.

15:30.373 --> 15:31.562
What's with you?

15:31.952 --> 15:34.523
- Nothing.
- Okay.

15:34.719 --> 15:38.523
Hey, look, Kev, you just, you
have to find your new football.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.695
You know, what's something
that you love to do?

15:43.234 --> 15:44.390
You don't get it, Dad.

15:44.415 --> 15:46.282
I mean, you didn't really have anything

15:46.307 --> 15:48.207
that you loved to do and then lost.

15:48.232 --> 15:49.812
Yeah, okay.

15:49.964 --> 15:51.914
Hey, you're... that's probably true.

15:52.095 --> 15:53.882
No. No, it's not true.

15:53.907 --> 15:56.093
- You-you never told them about Big Three?
- Mm.

15:56.671 --> 15:58.703
- What's that?
- Nothing.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.656
No, your dad was gonna start
his own construction company:

16:02.850 --> 16:04.250
Big Three Homes.

16:04.389 --> 16:06.125
- Really, you were?
- Yeah.

16:07.148 --> 16:08.265
So why didn't you?

16:08.290 --> 16:09.703
Well, why do you think?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.546
I mean, he stuck it out with our company

16:11.571 --> 16:13.273
so that you two and your sister

16:13.531 --> 16:15.097
could have everything
you've ever wanted.

16:15.328 --> 16:18.367
Look, it's... it wasn't the right
time to take a risk like that.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.195
- Okay.
- You got to own your choices, boys.

16:22.062 --> 16:25.148
Choose them fully and don't look back.

16:31.882 --> 16:33.516
- Hey, Miguel.
- Yeah?

16:33.584 --> 16:35.523
Hey, uh, why, uh...

16:37.453 --> 16:40.310
- why did you come with us today?
- Huh?

16:40.335 --> 16:42.131
Well, you know, obviously,
I'm staying with you guys

16:42.156 --> 16:44.126
so that I can connect
with my mom, right?

16:44.367 --> 16:46.066
But yet the first thing you do is...

16:46.898 --> 16:49.521
tag along with us to the grocery store.
I was just, I was wondering why.

16:49.546 --> 16:52.601
She's been a wreck ever since
you got arrested.

16:53.116 --> 16:55.765
And then you tore into her
at that session.

16:57.015 --> 17:00.351
So, yeah, I'm here now to protect her

17:00.921 --> 17:02.888
against any more bombs
that you might drop

17:02.956 --> 17:05.116
or any other blame that you
might want to lay on her.

17:06.202 --> 17:07.358
Well, you don't have
to protect her from me.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.561
I'm her son.

17:08.635 --> 17:09.882
And I'm her husband.

17:10.737 --> 17:12.280
My father was her husband.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.108
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.694
I'm William Hill's son.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.483
Downstairs, apartment four.

17:35.523 --> 17:38.589
Oh, yes. I liked him so much.

17:38.614 --> 17:40.562
I was so sorry to hear
that he had passed.

17:40.587 --> 17:41.679
Thank you.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.273
Say, did you like him
or did you love him?

17:46.616 --> 17:48.299
Now, wasn't he a fancy man?

17:48.507 --> 17:51.969
Fancy? Nah, he was pretty
low-k... oh, you mean gay.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.124
Yeah.

17:53.149 --> 17:55.030
No. Bi.

17:56.062 --> 17:57.179
Bye.

17:58.142 --> 17:59.233
N...

17:59.351 --> 18:01.646
William, he was just the best.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.405
Whenever the hot water would go out,

18:03.474 --> 18:05.654
which was a weekly
occurrence around here,

18:05.679 --> 18:08.607
he would bring me a big
ole pot of boiling water

18:08.632 --> 18:09.731
just so I could take a bath.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.304
Would you describe yourselves
as romantically involved?

18:19.576 --> 18:20.882
Yo, what's going on, brah?

18:21.441 --> 18:22.976
Do you recognize this woman?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.625
Wow.

18:37.694 --> 18:38.788
I know.

18:38.855 --> 18:40.890
It's like being inside
of a wedding cake.

18:42.046 --> 18:43.085
My gosh.

18:43.171 --> 18:44.632
Wait, are we the only ones here?

18:44.701 --> 18:45.804
It's B.A.O.

18:47.140 --> 18:48.587
By appointment only.

18:48.702 --> 18:50.004
I figured you'd be more comfortable

18:50.073 --> 18:51.765
if there were no other customers here.

18:52.104 --> 18:53.241
Thank you.

18:54.827 --> 18:56.804
Screw it, I am having one.

18:57.522 --> 18:59.960
I did yoga this morning,
the sweaty kind.

19:00.437 --> 19:01.687
No judgment here.

19:01.796 --> 19:02.741
I know.

19:03.718 --> 19:05.820
- Hey, Mad.
- Mm.

19:05.889 --> 19:07.499
I'm eating. Sorry.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.169
- Aw.
- You are so tiny. I hate you.

19:10.194 --> 19:12.101
Alexis, this is Kate.

19:12.126 --> 19:13.444
- It's great to meet you.
- Hi.

19:13.469 --> 19:16.498
I promise not to make you say
yes to the dress or anything.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.382
Oh, I actually love that show.

19:20.102 --> 19:22.382
But don't tell Hanga.
She thinks it's trash.

19:24.046 --> 19:25.343
- There we go.
- Oh.

19:25.368 --> 19:28.210
- Thanks.
- All right, come in. Come in.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.226
- Who is Hanga?
- The designer.

19:30.648 --> 19:33.023
- Oh.
- It's gonna be so fun.

19:33.554 --> 19:34.632
Wow.

20:10.093 --> 20:12.694
- Hey-o.
- Hey, babe.

20:13.070 --> 20:14.296
I was in the neighborhood.

20:14.321 --> 20:16.326
Had a little time to kill
before my interview.

20:16.351 --> 20:18.117
Figured I'd see if I could
take you out for a cappuccino.

20:18.186 --> 20:21.319
Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm
swamped at the moment, so...

20:21.554 --> 20:24.623
Found one of William's old poems
in this box that I picked up.

20:24.692 --> 20:26.491
It's a love poem.

20:26.762 --> 20:28.395
Think he was in love...

20:28.530 --> 20:30.694
with a woman from his old building

20:30.719 --> 20:32.530
before he met Jessie.

20:33.080 --> 20:36.081
I think they were lovers.

20:36.408 --> 20:37.540
- Randall.
- Yeah?

20:37.773 --> 20:39.339
I'm trying to do my job.

20:39.674 --> 20:41.440
I know you're kind of down
on those right now,

20:41.465 --> 20:42.999
but I still have to do mine, so...

20:43.024 --> 20:44.554
I'm not down on jobs, Beth.

20:45.122 --> 20:46.989
I'm down on one particular job.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.691
I'm just waiting for the perfect thing.

20:48.716 --> 20:50.171
You think my job is perfect?

20:50.351 --> 20:53.178
You think when I was a
wide-eyed, hardheaded undergrad

20:53.203 --> 20:55.070
writing all those
papers on fair housing,

20:55.095 --> 20:56.632
that I dreamt that I would spend my life

20:56.657 --> 21:00.194
sucking up to public officials
only to lose out to a Costco?

21:00.761 --> 21:03.729
- No.
- I know you're searching for something.

21:03.898 --> 21:06.014
Nobody supports your searches
more than I do, baby,

21:06.083 --> 21:10.054
but recently, it feels like you
are somewhere in outer space.

21:12.054 --> 21:14.241
I need you to go back to work.

21:14.895 --> 21:17.507
It's not about money. It's...

21:18.567 --> 21:20.093
I think it'll be good for you.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.241
For us.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.267
Can you do that?

21:27.304 --> 21:29.137
Can you come down from outer space

21:29.206 --> 21:31.139
and be in the real world with me?

21:35.499 --> 21:36.562
Thank you.

21:38.101 --> 21:41.507
You would look absolutely
stunning in something like this.

21:41.624 --> 21:45.163
Soft, empire waist, flairs out...

21:45.937 --> 21:48.632
But you have to love it. Do you love it?

21:48.976 --> 21:50.480
- I-I like the style.
- Mm-hmm.

21:50.482 --> 21:52.779
But I'm just not sure about it
being such a bright white.

21:52.804 --> 21:55.285
You know? What do you think?

21:55.968 --> 21:57.179
Madison?

21:57.383 --> 21:58.709
Wh-What do you think?

21:59.507 --> 22:00.591
Agreed.

22:00.741 --> 22:03.023
Yeah, we're-we're not
trying to blind anyone

22:03.048 --> 22:04.241
at this wedding, Lex.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.046
Show us something with flesh undertones.

22:08.288 --> 22:10.116
Got it. Uh...

22:10.663 --> 22:11.741
Ooh.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.366
How about this one? Mm-hmm?

22:15.576 --> 22:17.375
Yeah, way closer.

22:17.734 --> 22:19.233
BRB, I got to pee.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.491
How do you feel about lace?

22:26.274 --> 22:27.452
I like lace.

22:31.335 --> 22:32.663
Here you go.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.366
Isn't Hanga's stuff amazing?

22:36.921 --> 22:40.257
Madison, I know
what you did... back there.

22:41.054 --> 22:42.763
It's really just a small fee
to reserve the place.

22:42.788 --> 22:44.627
It's-it's not a big deal.

22:44.652 --> 22:46.085
No. In the bathroom.

22:46.225 --> 22:48.158
After you ate all the macaroons.

22:50.569 --> 22:55.608
When you talk in group,
it's not about anything... real.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.319
Or, at least that's what I thought.

22:57.601 --> 22:59.632
I mean, you went to town
on those desserts...

23:00.023 --> 23:01.194
What are you doing?

23:01.921 --> 23:02.968
Madison...

23:03.218 --> 23:05.358
- No. Why are you ruining this?
- Listen,

23:05.616 --> 23:07.660
I know that it's hard to talk about.

23:07.685 --> 23:08.828
- Ech...
- Madison...

23:08.896 --> 23:10.730
Just find your own way home.

23:15.398 --> 23:16.986
We're currently the frontrunner

23:17.011 --> 23:19.303
in the development
of cellulosic ethanol.

23:19.328 --> 23:21.921
Not to toot our own horn, but
it's pretty cutting-edge stuff.

23:21.946 --> 23:23.612
Does any of that appeal to you?

23:23.637 --> 23:24.836
Actually, yes.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.023
Sorry.

23:28.003 --> 23:29.836
I'm sorry, Sue, I should take this.

23:29.861 --> 23:31.421
Uh, it could be my kids' school.

23:31.554 --> 23:33.546
- Oh. Sure.
- I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

23:33.647 --> 23:35.280
Hey, this is Randall.

23:35.444 --> 23:36.874
Randall, it's Lloyd.

23:36.899 --> 23:38.331
Lloyd, yes.

23:38.468 --> 23:40.080
I saw your note in the hallway.

23:40.149 --> 23:41.548
Did you talk with the super?

23:41.650 --> 23:43.250
No. I spoke to a lot of people,

23:43.319 --> 23:44.518
but not the super.

23:44.749 --> 23:47.177
Well, Donna is with her grandkids

23:47.202 --> 23:48.679
on the first floor.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.015
She has kids?

23:50.040 --> 23:51.632
Now, I'm not one for gossip,

23:51.929 --> 23:54.787
but I saw William coming and going

23:54.812 --> 23:57.327
from that apartment at all hours,

23:57.421 --> 23:59.179
if you know what I mean.

23:59.468 --> 24:01.093
Oh, hell, I love gossip.

24:01.241 --> 24:04.335
Uh, thanks, Lloyd.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.677
Thank you very much.

24:07.596 --> 24:09.496
Wait, why would you want to cover up...

24:09.856 --> 24:11.700
- What?
- Oh, goodness.

24:12.466 --> 24:14.191
"Where are we gonna put our hot tub"?

24:14.216 --> 24:16.223
It's a tiny house. What did they expect?

24:16.248 --> 24:18.352
Listen to her. Do you hear her voice?

24:18.481 --> 24:19.700
Maybe I'll build you

24:19.725 --> 24:20.888
- a tiny house one day.
- Oh.

24:22.159 --> 24:23.558
Hi, sweetheart.

24:23.776 --> 24:24.973
How are you?

24:25.932 --> 24:28.466
I'm just... restless,

24:28.491 --> 24:30.458
and nighttime's weird, and I'm...

24:30.483 --> 24:32.403
Why don't I go make you some tea?

24:32.598 --> 24:34.536
Yeah? You want some tea? You want tea?

24:34.561 --> 24:36.411
- Uh, sure. Thank you so much.
- That's nice of you.

24:36.436 --> 24:37.591
Thank you.

24:38.214 --> 24:41.081
Your mother just can't
get enough of this show.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.583
Yeah. Huh.

24:51.217 --> 24:52.333
Uh...

24:53.888 --> 24:56.981
Miguel, I'm sorry about earlier. I'm...

24:57.006 --> 24:58.552
No, no, no, no. It's-it's...

24:58.831 --> 24:59.934
Me, too.

25:00.975 --> 25:02.375
Can I just ask you something?

25:02.848 --> 25:05.294
- Yeah, uh, anything.
- Okay.

25:07.513 --> 25:09.317
Were you, uh...

25:11.247 --> 25:14.052
Were you in love with my mom
when my dad was alive?

25:14.999 --> 25:16.114
What?

25:19.294 --> 25:22.138
Kevin, no. No, no, that...

25:22.630 --> 25:24.192
that would have been impossible.

25:25.364 --> 25:26.620
I don't know what you mean.

25:27.309 --> 25:29.997
How to explain this, um...

25:30.973 --> 25:33.567
See, your mom... your mom and dad,

25:34.434 --> 25:35.598
they were one.

25:35.981 --> 25:38.684
There was... there was no Jack,

25:39.240 --> 25:41.138
and there was no Rebecca. It was just...

25:42.708 --> 25:44.888
it was just Jack and Rebecca.

25:48.192 --> 25:52.135
So, the notion that I would have
been in love with your mother

25:52.160 --> 25:55.261
back then, it's just...
it-it never even occurred to me.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.692
Ever.

25:57.966 --> 25:59.841
Do you understand what I'm saying?

26:01.232 --> 26:02.559
I do, yeah.

26:05.253 --> 26:07.677
But I do love her now.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.286
Kevin...

26:14.113 --> 26:15.653
I'm not going anywhere.

26:34.317 --> 26:35.434
Hello?

26:37.583 --> 26:38.606
What?

26:39.138 --> 26:40.395
Wait, wait, what?

26:43.341 --> 26:44.491
Madison?

26:46.570 --> 26:47.778
Coming in.

26:48.949 --> 26:50.169
Madison?

26:57.114 --> 26:58.278
Madison?

27:01.763 --> 27:03.863
- Oh, my God.
- I'm okay.

27:03.932 --> 27:05.317
I think I fainted again.

27:05.742 --> 27:07.528
I... I'm okay.

27:07.635 --> 27:08.846
Here, let me help you.

27:08.871 --> 27:10.145
Careful. Be careful.

27:10.708 --> 27:11.934
There you are.

27:11.959 --> 27:13.864
I've been looking for you everywhere.

27:14.036 --> 27:16.755
- Sorry.
- You can't just leave me, Kate.

27:18.739 --> 27:20.247
How was the dress?

27:22.220 --> 27:23.411
It didn't fit.

27:25.122 --> 27:26.963
Well, why don't we go
try on some others, then,

27:26.988 --> 27:29.309
- and find something that you love?
- Mom, stop it!

27:31.524 --> 27:34.575
Okay? Just... just please stop.

27:41.614 --> 27:43.147
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:43.927 --> 27:45.098
You the super?

27:45.398 --> 27:47.809
Feeling pretty average, but yeah.

27:49.942 --> 27:51.169
That's a "super" joke.

27:51.286 --> 27:52.848
- Funny.
- Okay.

27:53.610 --> 27:55.567
This is gonna seem random.

27:56.303 --> 27:57.966
I'm William Hill's son.

27:59.294 --> 28:00.802
He lived in apartment four.

28:01.309 --> 28:03.468
That old pain in my ass.

28:04.294 --> 28:06.145
- You know what he used to do?
- Hmm?

28:06.170 --> 28:08.895
Every time somebody's
stove wouldn't light,

28:09.263 --> 28:11.481
or their water wouldn't go on,

28:11.506 --> 28:14.007
he'd come banging on
my door to report it.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.809
You know, and I explained
to him a thousand times,

28:16.834 --> 28:18.927
I can't fix things without money.

28:18.952 --> 28:21.442
So, he wasn't coming around here

28:21.467 --> 28:24.168
'cause you two were...

28:24.425 --> 28:26.684
- William and me?
- Mm-hmm.

28:26.709 --> 28:28.528
No...

28:28.839 --> 28:30.161
No, no, no.

28:32.672 --> 28:34.388
I'll tell you this, though.

28:34.572 --> 28:35.919
When he moved,

28:36.583 --> 28:39.700
man, the building felt it, you know?

28:40.641 --> 28:43.864
It was kind of like we lost a heart,

28:44.592 --> 28:47.286
and there was no place
for the blood to go.

28:53.013 --> 28:54.567
I found this poem he wrote.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.434
Would you believe I
thought it was a sign,

29:02.595 --> 29:04.052
me finding it now?

29:10.496 --> 29:11.919
Let me show you something.

29:12.231 --> 29:13.705
- Okay.
- Okay. Come.

29:14.977 --> 29:16.122
The door...

29:24.263 --> 29:26.755
Just lost the tenant
that lived here after William.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.317
Take a look around.

29:30.716 --> 29:31.763
That's okay.

29:32.844 --> 29:34.169
I don't want to... yeah.

29:36.116 --> 29:37.248
Take a look around.

29:51.111 --> 29:54.813
Get it. Down to the right. Get it.

30:15.177 --> 30:17.069
Well, what do we have here?

30:18.542 --> 30:19.966
Ooh.

30:21.184 --> 30:23.302
You are one ugly cat.

30:24.106 --> 30:25.198
No offense.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.723
You hungry? All right.

30:28.317 --> 30:31.208
Let's see what I can drum up for you.

30:31.802 --> 30:34.817
There's a little Lactaid.
Hope you don't mind.

30:36.114 --> 30:37.333
There we go.

30:38.536 --> 30:39.536
Yeah.

30:40.599 --> 30:41.794
Rough day, huh?

30:42.685 --> 30:45.052
You're good to hang here
for a little bit.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.364
This is my favorite spot.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.817
It's got a great view of...

30:53.811 --> 30:57.575
"Lady, I am straight up fixed on you...

30:58.317 --> 31:00.817
"Always I walk the same steps.

31:01.057 --> 31:02.423
"I push open the door,

31:02.703 --> 31:05.122
"I end up in front of you.

31:06.669 --> 31:10.928
Always you. Always you, my Lady."

31:23.083 --> 31:26.911
Lady Day. Billie was
one of my favorites.

31:28.466 --> 31:29.661
Oh, damn.

31:33.252 --> 31:34.513
Oh, damn.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.067
- Sorry.
- You don't need to take care of me.

31:43.708 --> 31:47.020
So... you're all alone and
you're bleeding from the head.

31:47.045 --> 31:48.130
I kind of do.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.864
- I'm sorry I called.
- Well...?

31:53.177 --> 31:55.239
I couldn't call my family. They'd...

31:56.583 --> 31:57.716
..freak out.

31:58.598 --> 31:59.794
Do you want to talk about it?

32:00.700 --> 32:01.833
It's new.

32:04.066 --> 32:07.473
I mean, I used to do it
in middle school, but I stopped,

32:07.785 --> 32:09.351
until a few weeks ago.

32:10.575 --> 32:13.341
I was really upset when I got home.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.747
So I ate.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.169
So much.

32:18.716 --> 32:21.722
This crappy frozen yogurt

32:21.747 --> 32:23.825
I've had in the freezer forever.

32:25.559 --> 32:26.744
And then I...

32:29.207 --> 32:30.544
I felt better.

32:31.981 --> 32:34.028
But I got really dizzy.

32:35.496 --> 32:36.864
I guess I fell.

32:40.613 --> 32:42.559
I know you think I'm insane.

32:45.114 --> 32:46.731
No.

32:47.106 --> 32:48.699
I don't think you're insane.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.989
Um...

32:53.247 --> 32:56.274
Right before my dad died,
I got really skinny.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.793
I pretty much stopped eating everything,

33:00.818 --> 33:02.138
except for baby carrots.

33:02.572 --> 33:04.841
Me and you, we could've shared clothes.

33:05.872 --> 33:08.550
And I was so, just so sure

33:08.575 --> 33:10.372
that being skinny would make me happy.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.669
My whole life,

33:12.161 --> 33:13.808
I had that voice in my
head just screaming,

33:13.833 --> 33:15.030
just shouting at me,

33:15.427 --> 33:17.060
"Lose the weight. Try harder.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.020
You're fat and you're pathetic."

33:21.424 --> 33:24.513
And so, I did it. I lost the weight.

33:30.184 --> 33:32.248
But listening to that
voice my whole life,

33:32.316 --> 33:34.255
I didn't know who I was without it.

33:35.576 --> 33:37.419
And then I just, I felt empty.

33:46.395 --> 33:48.630
I was more comfortable being fat

33:49.052 --> 33:50.579
because I actually liked

33:50.604 --> 33:52.044
being mad at myself all the time.

33:52.069 --> 33:53.638
I liked the voice.

34:06.579 --> 34:07.707
So...

34:08.717 --> 34:10.458
I don't think you're insane.

34:14.324 --> 34:16.958
Thank you for taking care of me.

34:18.138 --> 34:20.699
- Oh, of course.
- You're really nice.

34:21.099 --> 34:22.918
Eh.

34:23.317 --> 34:24.989
- Oh, my God.
- What?

34:25.254 --> 34:27.121
Should we host a podcast?

34:27.150 --> 34:29.395
No. No one wants that.

34:37.755 --> 34:40.067
Well... so...

34:41.402 --> 34:43.753
I think I like the dress
with the empire waist.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.106
You're gonna say yes to the dress?

34:47.263 --> 34:48.668
Aw!

34:51.121 --> 34:52.270
I can't believe it.

34:53.399 --> 34:55.402
I finally have a best friend.

35:07.763 --> 35:10.520
Hey. Thanks for indulging me.

35:10.737 --> 35:11.973
This better be good.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.263
You're right.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.333
I've been doing a lot of searching
these last few months.

35:25.442 --> 35:29.028
Spent too much time
in outer space, but Beth,

35:29.763 --> 35:31.395
I got called up out of the blue

35:31.420 --> 35:33.544
and asked to come
to this run-down building

35:33.569 --> 35:35.083
to pick up a cardboard box.

35:35.538 --> 35:39.240
And in that box was a poem
about my father's lady,

35:39.763 --> 35:41.848
that turned out to be
a Billie Holiday mural,

35:41.873 --> 35:44.794
but still, that poem led me
directly to my lady,

35:45.809 --> 35:48.083
who wakes up every morning
and fights to create

35:48.108 --> 35:50.669
beautiful spaces for the
people who need them most.

35:51.239 --> 35:55.039
My lady, who's been the answer
to every search I've been on

35:55.064 --> 35:56.473
since I was 19 years old.

36:01.489 --> 36:03.630
I want to buy this building
with you, Beth.

36:05.193 --> 36:06.692
I want to change these people's lives.

36:06.761 --> 36:10.763
Give them the comfort
and the dignity they deserve.

36:11.265 --> 36:12.520
The building manager, she knows...

36:14.309 --> 36:15.505
You hungry?

36:24.269 --> 36:26.942
Randall, hey.

36:27.044 --> 36:29.106
You look like you're gonna pass out.
What's up?

36:29.922 --> 36:31.169
Uh...

36:32.213 --> 36:33.661
Will you go out with me?

36:34.813 --> 36:35.927
Oh.

36:36.092 --> 36:37.973
- Um...
- Before you answer,

36:39.280 --> 36:40.713
maybe you should let fate decide.

36:52.431 --> 36:54.270
Okay. What do you think?

36:54.295 --> 36:56.130
You think the boss
is gonna like this one?

36:56.496 --> 36:58.997
Yeah. Looks good.

36:59.363 --> 37:00.833
Yeah? Okay.

37:04.567 --> 37:05.825
So how about now?

37:06.949 --> 37:07.997
You think now's a good time

37:08.022 --> 37:09.645
to start the Big Three?

37:11.075 --> 37:14.589
No. No, bud, I got three of you
about to go off to college,

37:14.614 --> 37:16.223
so... no.

37:18.739 --> 37:20.466
Let's button this up. Give me this.

37:22.192 --> 37:23.270
Here we go.

37:24.496 --> 37:27.075
Sometimes, always,

37:28.083 --> 37:29.169
never.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.505
Here, get your hand right
inside the lapel there.

37:32.677 --> 37:34.427
Make sure it's not too tight, too loose.

37:34.562 --> 37:35.761
- No.
- Feels good?

37:35.786 --> 37:37.173
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

37:37.427 --> 37:38.575
- Good.
- Yeah.

37:38.864 --> 37:40.708
Good. You look good.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.091
- Thanks.
- Sharp.

37:43.755 --> 37:45.288
Yeah, the pants are gonna fit better

37:45.356 --> 37:48.193
once you get out of that cast,
but they work for now.

37:48.218 --> 37:49.284
You look good.

37:49.598 --> 37:50.833
You look real good.

37:51.322 --> 37:53.021
Straighten this tie, though.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.436
Thank you, Dad.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.453
You're welcome.

38:07.645 --> 38:09.864
Okay. How do you feel?

38:11.017 --> 38:13.216
I feel like I'm wearing a suit.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.793
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

38:19.818 --> 38:20.872
Oh, yeah.

38:27.335 --> 38:28.786
You know, I, um...

38:29.841 --> 38:31.966
Last night, when you were, um...

38:32.778 --> 38:34.638
you were watching TV with Miguel,

38:36.013 --> 38:37.942
I noticed that you had
your head on his shoulder,

38:37.967 --> 38:40.809
and then, as soon as you saw me,

38:40.834 --> 38:43.872
you-you... sort of... pulled away.

38:47.005 --> 38:48.138
Hmm.

38:52.077 --> 38:53.856
I, um...

38:55.270 --> 38:56.950
I thought that it might be, uh,

38:56.975 --> 38:59.325
hard for you to see us like that.

39:00.817 --> 39:01.997
Right.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.119
You shouldn't have to worry
about how I feel, Mom.

39:08.559 --> 39:11.169
You shouldn't, you know,
and-and, you know...

39:12.951 --> 39:14.161
Kevin...

39:14.486 --> 39:15.794
You're happy with him?

39:22.350 --> 39:24.184
After your father died,

39:24.989 --> 39:26.841
I had to let go of a lot of things,

39:26.866 --> 39:30.010
and happiness was one
of the first things to go.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.802
And it was like that

39:32.871 --> 39:34.395
for a very, very long time.

39:36.554 --> 39:40.263
What I found with Miguel is, um...

39:42.626 --> 39:43.863
...quieter

39:44.414 --> 39:45.864
and older.

39:46.350 --> 39:49.184
But... yeah.

39:50.436 --> 39:51.786
Yeah, I'm happy.

39:54.239 --> 39:56.325
He really makes me laugh.

39:58.268 --> 39:59.325
He does.

40:00.044 --> 40:02.475
Laughing with him or at him?
I'm just, you know, saying.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.234
- Kevin, stop it.
- I mean, come on.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.706
- I need you to talk to Kate.
- Hmm.

40:20.122 --> 40:23.119
- Something is up with her.
- Yeah, I noticed that, too.

40:24.098 --> 40:26.161
And if anyone can get
through to her, it's you.

40:26.481 --> 40:28.991
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll talk to her.
- Okay.

40:30.066 --> 40:31.906
Kev seems to like his new suit.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.797
Yeah. Yeah, he does.

40:37.950 --> 40:39.309
- Bec?
- Yeah?

40:40.770 --> 40:42.364
I hate wearing suits.

40:43.684 --> 40:45.741
- Okay.
- And I hate Walter.

40:47.091 --> 40:48.411
Walter, ech.

40:49.669 --> 40:50.911
I'm thinking...

40:53.270 --> 40:56.552
I'm thinking I want to try
and start the business again.

40:57.716 --> 40:58.921
Big Three Homes.

41:00.216 --> 41:01.513
- What?
- Yeah.

41:03.536 --> 41:05.464
You want to just...

41:05.489 --> 41:08.348
Quit my job and start
a construction business. Yeah.

41:09.192 --> 41:12.500
Babe, we have three kids who are
about to go off to college soon.

41:12.525 --> 41:15.169
You really think that now is the
right time to start a business?

41:15.194 --> 41:16.325
No.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.067
Probably not.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.270
Well, I guess that's...

41:27.727 --> 41:29.833
gonna make it pretty exciting, isn't it?

41:47.775 --> 41:48.973
Wow.

41:51.966 --> 41:54.419
Hey, babe, did we forget
something at the mall?

41:55.770 --> 41:57.002
I don't think so.

41:59.436 --> 42:00.630
Huh.

42:01.407 --> 42:03.974
Well, tell me more about Big Three
Homes. When did this come about?
