WEBVTT

00:31.907 --> 00:35.696
<i>They saw many men
on foot, all starving.</i>

00:35.786 --> 00:37.368
He met them?

00:40.123 --> 00:43.287
"We saw a captain there.
The one called Aglooka."

00:47.673 --> 00:49.630
Ask him...

00:49.716 --> 00:51.378
if one of these men

00:51.468 --> 00:54.927
is the one...
he's calling... Aglooka.

01:09.528 --> 01:13.238
"He spoke in our tongue.
He was dying."

01:17.035 --> 01:21.154
"He pointed south. Says they
were going over land. Home."

01:21.248 --> 01:23.865
"But they could barely walk."

01:29.381 --> 01:31.247
"And with Tuunbaq behind them."

01:31.341 --> 01:33.082
Tuunbaq?

01:37.306 --> 01:40.219
"Behind them, coming.
Always coming."

01:40.309 --> 01:42.926
Someone was pursuing them?
An Eskimo?

01:43.020 --> 01:45.808
"From the shamans."

01:49.526 --> 01:52.109
"The thing that eats
on two legs and four."

01:54.698 --> 01:58.191
"The thing made of muscles...
and spells."

01:58.285 --> 02:01.653
I don't understand.
Is he describing a man?

02:01.747 --> 02:06.367
Sorry, Sir James. I don't know
what the hell he's describing.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.374
What did Francis say?

02:11.715 --> 02:16.130
Aglooka?

02:17.095 --> 02:19.382
"Your friend took my hands.

02:19.473 --> 02:23.137
He said, 'Tell those who come
after us not to stay."'

02:25.562 --> 02:28.475
"'The ships are gone.
There's no way through.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.522
No passage."'

02:30.609 --> 02:33.022
"'Tell them we are gone." '

02:33.111 --> 02:35.899
"'Dead... and gone.'"

03:20.784 --> 03:24.198
Billy, take this one up
with you and don't let him down

03:24.287 --> 03:26.700
till he can do his becket bends
with both his eyes closed.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.326
Yes, sir.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.998
Captain, sir.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.257
Daily observations
are starting to

03:46.351 --> 03:48.343
make for bizarre reading, sir.

03:48.437 --> 03:52.021
Well, magnetic north
wanders miles every day.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.565
We're within its circle now.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.563
It'll be tall headlines
for the men.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.861
<i>Terror</i> is signaling,
Sir John.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.119
Captain Crozier requests
an ice report.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.166
Shall I send Mr. Reid back?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.587
No. Tell Francis, James and I
will be joining him for dinner.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.000
Mr. Terry!
Open the flag box!

04:21.094 --> 04:22.255
Word has it, they've not yet

04:22.345 --> 04:23.961
run out of beef tongue
on <i>Terror.</i>

04:29.895 --> 04:32.763
Of all the hardships
of the Discovery Service,

04:32.856 --> 04:34.438
this may be the toughest.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.141
It's three courses tonight
and a dessert.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.194
It'll be over
before you know it, Captain.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.272
Not if Fitzjames is with us.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.274
We'll have to hear
his whole saga

04:45.368 --> 04:49.203
of policing that massive
guano deposit off Namibia.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.577
Or the time he got shot
by the Chinese.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.286
I'm inclined to put the food
in my ears.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.793
I haven't settled the matter
of spirits for tonight, sir.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.800
Sir John abstains, of course,

05:02.886 --> 05:04.673
and it's Allsopp's for the rest.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.927
But is there anything special
you require, sir?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.012
More open water,
clear to the Pacific.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.472
And then we can go home.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.649
We're close, sir.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.319
Careful how you use that word,
"close."

05:23.907 --> 05:26.570
This is the Discovery Service.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.449
"Close" is nothing.
It's worse than nothing.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.033
It's worse than
anything in the world.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.846
Welcome aboard, Sir John.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.512
Captain Fitzjames.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.184
If we're that near the pole,

06:01.278 --> 06:03.019
we'll see King William Land
any day, then.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.025
Look who's an expert.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.152
Mr. Farr showed me on the chart.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.609
Past King William Land
we get to the American coast

06:09.703 --> 06:11.615
and it's all mapped out again
from there.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.286
Hello, boy.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.960
That thing whined all night.
Must be sick or got a scent.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.880
With the right wind,
he can smell bears at a mile.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.548
The brigades already ashore

06:24.634 --> 06:26.546
were catching
every kind of fire,

06:26.636 --> 06:28.377
so I was bringing out
the Congreves.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.712
- Rockets.
- Yes.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.173
Ironic, considering it was
the Chinese themselves

06:32.267 --> 06:34.054
who had pioneered the things.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.885
We shot the marksmen down
off the city walls

06:35.979 --> 06:37.220
and we started up.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.897
As I climbed the ladder,
I was thinking of...

06:39.983 --> 06:42.566
Caesar crossing the Rubicon.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.235
We reached the top and I saw
the city of Chinkiang

06:45.322 --> 06:48.861
laid out before us,
wavering in the morning heat.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.907
And the soldiers
in the alleys below

06:50.994 --> 06:52.951
started using
their matchlocks on us,

06:53.038 --> 06:56.452
those muskets for which you
carry a lit taper at all times.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.624
But in such dry conditions,

06:58.710 --> 07:00.576
when we'd shoot one of them,

07:00.670 --> 07:02.787
they would fall down
on top of these tapers

07:02.881 --> 07:06.090
and they would catch fire
like tinder piles.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.544
So, soon the whole city
was dotted with these

07:09.638 --> 07:11.675
lone columns
of personal smoke,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.677
and the whole view
smelled of roast duck.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.601
And then we rushed down
into the streets

07:17.687 --> 07:20.771
to assist the 49th, which we
could hear was under attack.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.689
We came upon
a pack of Chinese

07:22.776 --> 07:24.768
behind a street barricade.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.445
And I'd... I'd just loaded
a rocket and aimed...

07:28.531 --> 07:31.319
when I was pierced.
Single musket ball.

07:31.409 --> 07:35.119
Size of a cherry.
Passed clean through my arm

07:35.205 --> 07:38.664
and kept on in, making a third
wound here, entering my chest.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.867
Like the shot that killed
Lord Nelson at Trafalgar.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.624
And, had it not used up
most of its energy on my arm,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.170
yes, I might have ended
same as he.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.624
Tell us about Birdshit Island,
why don't you, James?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.926
That's a capital story.

07:54.099 --> 07:58.469
Mr. Reid and I chatted
about the ice today.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.645
He tells me we've started
sailing past slabs

08:01.731 --> 08:04.269
he thinks are not part of
the summer break-up.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.646
- Old ice?
- He's not concerned.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.352
He thinks we're close to
an intersection

08:08.446 --> 08:10.312
with some bigger channel
coming down from the north,

08:10.407 --> 08:12.319
bringing bergy bits with it.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.446
But it means
our little summer strait

08:14.536 --> 08:16.994
is likely coming to an end.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.323
It has yet to be named,
and I thought...

08:20.417 --> 08:24.001
Sir James Ross
could be honored thusly.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.953
Hear, hear.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.164
Would that he were
here with us now.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.215
But for being a newlywed.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.384
You approve, Francis?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.046
He'll be very pleased.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.722
What rank is that dog?
You ever wonder that?

08:44.816 --> 08:47.354
Mm. He's on decks
most nights,

08:47.444 --> 08:50.061
so I guess you could
call that watch duty.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.739
I don't know. That'd make him
a... AB. Or a Marine.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.236
But he can walk
the quarterdeck,

08:55.326 --> 08:58.569
so that makes him
a Petty Officer at least. Right?

08:58.663 --> 09:01.121
And some nights he's back
there in officers' country.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.574
Petty Officers can't sleep aft,

09:04.335 --> 09:06.577
so would that be considered
a Wardroom Officer?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.005
What would that be?

09:10.091 --> 09:12.253
A Mate? A Lieutenant?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.209
Are we still talking
about this dog?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.967
It's of consequence, though,
isn't it?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.345
Puttin' a dog above a man.
Who serves who in that arrangement?

09:20.435 --> 09:23.473
It's a ship's dog.
We put up with it.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.557
All right?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.979
Young?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.606
David?

09:33.364 --> 09:35.321
David? David!

09:39.871 --> 09:41.453
Gangway!

09:42.874 --> 09:45.787
- Get a doctor now!
- Come on!

09:45.877 --> 09:47.789
- Roll him over!
- Watch it!

10:21.955 --> 10:25.323
I don't want to be the first
one to say the word, Sir John,

10:25.416 --> 10:27.123
but we're all thinking it.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.997
None of the three who died at Beechey

10:29.087 --> 10:30.953
showed any sign of it.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.879
And, even if it's the case now,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.832
we will be in the Pacific

10:34.926 --> 10:36.337
before it has a chance to don

10:36.427 --> 10:37.963
its undertaker's weepers.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.966
Your confidence is reassuring, of course.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.299
You're not confident
with all our progress?

10:44.394 --> 10:48.308
I don't know why. We've all but
found the passage in a year.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.560
We're not rowing drakkars after all.

10:50.650 --> 10:55.065
In this place, technology still
bends the knee to luck, James.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.990
Sir. We've given the boy a Dover's powder.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.163
Settled his spasms.
He's resting now. As he can.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.992
But he has a dark blood in his stool.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.668
Digested blood.
He's bleeding above his colon.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.497
- That's a vivid description.
- Is it scurvy?

11:14.591 --> 11:17.004
Though I see nothing to mark it
as such, I can't rule it out.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.210
But if I were to wager a guess
at this point,

11:19.304 --> 11:20.886
I'd say the patient's consumptive.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.430
Doesn't always attack the lungs.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.677
Dr. Stanley should examine him.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.349
Perhaps he can discern something more.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.849
- I'll send a gig for him.
- No, no. There's no need.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.225
- We'll take him with us.
- Young?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.399
- In his condition?
- Yes.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.191
Wrap him up well
and have our boat readied.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.611
I... I would hesitate to move him, sir.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.565
I don't frankly know how much
spirit the boy has left in him.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.900
Bit of cool air will freshen him.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.907
He'll be tucked up just
the same in half an hour's time.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.951
Steady now.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.911
Ease away.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.923
Oh, Francis.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.721
Tell your cook "yes" to the cow's head,

12:04.807 --> 12:07.049
"no" to the capers he cooked it with.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.805
For future visits.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.189
Good night, Francis.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.392
Try to shake the Brown study.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.694
All is well.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.028
All clear. Heave away.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.121
There is nothing worse than
a man who has lost his joy.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.412
He's become insufferable.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.963
And he's a lushington to boot.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.917
We should be better friends to him, James.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.548
I can't work out why he's even here.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.174
He despises glory.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.473
Even the glory of a good pudding.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.470
And he looks down on we of the wardroom.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.597
I tell you, one glance from him...

12:51.688 --> 12:53.645
I have to remind myself I'm not a fraud.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.315
I'll not have you speak of him
uncharitably, James.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.314
He is my second.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.895
Now, if something were to happen to me,

13:00.989 --> 13:04.232
you would be his second.
You should cherish that man.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.242
Sometimes I think you love your men

13:07.328 --> 13:09.320
more than even God loves them, Sir John.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.997
For all your sakes,
let's hope you're wrong.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.338
Ready, all!

13:24.887 --> 13:27.095
Ready to let go the bowlines!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.728
Aarghh!

13:35.815 --> 13:37.898
Man overboard starboard side!

13:38.484 --> 13:40.726
All hands on deck!

13:40.820 --> 13:43.233
All eyes on the man in the water!

13:44.824 --> 13:46.986
Who's marking him?

13:55.585 --> 13:56.917
There!

13:57.003 --> 13:59.620
Stand back!

13:59.714 --> 14:01.626
Grab the line!

14:02.967 --> 14:06.210
Give me room! Give me room!

14:20.360 --> 14:22.352
- Collins, no!
- Let me try!

14:22.445 --> 14:24.607
That seaman wouldn't want you
to risk more!

14:24.697 --> 14:25.904
Billy Orren, that's who it is!

14:25.990 --> 14:27.356
He's gone!

14:44.467 --> 14:47.585
What I fail to understand is
why you chose not to speak up

14:47.678 --> 14:49.419
when you began feeling this take root.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.096
Wide.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.561
I've been getting headaches all me life.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.731
Didn't think nothing of it.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.394
And we've been drinking that
squeezed lemon every night.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.776
Crew's under strictest orders
to come forward if unwell.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.568
I'd think burying three
of your mates on Beechey

15:11.661 --> 15:13.948
was sufficient motivation.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.121
The lemon juice is not a cure-all.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.122
I didn't want to disappoint Sir John.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.505
Well, he can praise your
loyalty as he buries you.

15:33.224 --> 15:38.094
We can't spin the propeller nor
retract it. Mr. Reid is certain

15:38.187 --> 15:40.270
we must have caught a growler
at the surface.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.518
- So, is it blocked?
- Yes.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.474
Yes. Mr. Gregory thinks there must be ice

15:44.569 --> 15:46.811
wedged up in the prop well.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.191
But we won't know till first light.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.773
He all but assured me

15:50.867 --> 15:53.530
if we can clear out a jam,
we'll be under way.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.448
Good. I think that's all
for now, then, Graham,

15:58.541 --> 16:00.533
since we don't appear to be sinking.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.835
Wake me if that should change.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.256
Algonquian, massacred by Mohawk.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.936
- Did that disturb you?
- Which part, Francis?

17:03.022 --> 17:06.015
The savages,
or that they became Catholics?

17:10.445 --> 17:13.564
I have a question for you later.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.694
No question is needed, Francis.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.904
But you'll hear me out?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.880
Sir James Ross at Furthest South.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.218
If you believe that depiction,
you've dropped a stone at least

17:34.303 --> 17:36.511
since we've been back.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.054
And seen a dentist as well, apparently.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.223
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:40.309 --> 17:43.222
it's our great honor
to find up in the boxes tonight

17:43.312 --> 17:46.931
the actual Sir James Ross!

17:52.488 --> 17:54.525
Get up, old man.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.787
Bravo, gentlemen! Bravo.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.127
You should stand up.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.658
I don't want you to do to me

18:40.745 --> 18:42.782
what you did to Tom Hartnell's brother.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.613
Well...

18:45.541 --> 18:48.659
that... that was for the good of the crew.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.621
We needed to know if it was
scurvy killed John Hartnell...

18:51.714 --> 18:53.797
I want to go to my grave as I am.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.251
Don't cut me open.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.338
- Do you promise?
- If Sir John orders it done,

19:01.432 --> 19:03.139
we must do.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.763
You may be a warning of things to come.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.932
Now, hold... hold fast, David.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.354
If Sir John orders it...

19:17.448 --> 19:19.656
I will do it.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.483
Do you know...

19:21.577 --> 19:24.160
sometimes...

19:24.246 --> 19:26.659
when people are near passing...

19:26.749 --> 19:29.332
I've heard they speak of a radiance...

19:30.086 --> 19:33.329
...like a million daybreaks all in one.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.920
In which loved ones are there
to welcome them over.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.718
We grew up at the Foundlings.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.047
I never knew me father...

19:43.140 --> 19:44.722
or me mum.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.850
Then...

19:50.940 --> 19:53.683
Then there will be the angels...

19:53.776 --> 19:56.393
with songs... lovelier than you've heard.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.111
Will I fly? Up to God?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.237
Yes.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.695
You... You'll see the Passage
first, then, as you go.

20:06.789 --> 20:10.123
Try... Try to call back
and let us know where it is.

20:15.423 --> 20:19.383
I wanted to be here... when we found it.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.084
Do not fear it, David. I...

20:21.178 --> 20:22.464
I have been there

20:22.555 --> 20:24.171
when souls have passed.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.966
A great peace descends.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.803
They are glass.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.476
But the ring is plate.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.777
It won't fetch much
but my sister should have it.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.900
It's a nasty jar but...

20:40.990 --> 20:43.073
...but I can't get it off.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.491
I... I can ask cook for some grease.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.194
- Or I have an oil of castor...
- No.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.786
When you're sure I'm gone...

20:53.461 --> 20:55.123
...find a way.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.086
And don't tell Sir John I was afraid.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.088
You have my word.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.590
There's nothing

21:04.680 --> 21:05.966
to be afraid of.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.404
He's been going on like that
since the wind died.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.786
Something's got him worked up.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.289
Take your wigs off.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.383
Don't you hear that?

22:12.289 --> 22:15.578
- Give me your glass.
- Yeah.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.001
Just don't drop it. It belongs
to Lieutenant Irving.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.044
Put a thumb in it.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.893
No...

22:39.275 --> 22:41.141
No...

22:42.778 --> 22:44.690
No.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.026
No!

22:47.116 --> 22:48.527
David?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.485
- No. No.
- David? David?

23:07.678 --> 23:09.670
Wake Mr. Blanky.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.052
Do it now.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.179
No!

23:16.228 --> 23:18.390
No!

23:18.480 --> 23:22.975
Run! Run! He wants us to run!

23:23.068 --> 23:25.731
- David, calm down.
- No!

24:15.037 --> 24:17.120
Come.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.078
Sorry to disturb you.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.959
David Young has passed.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.208
As if that weren't plain.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.216
Cover him and get some rest, Mr. Goodsir.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.298
Some... Some...

24:37.393 --> 24:40.886
You can do the post-mortem in
the morning when the men go up.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.847
I-Is it necessary?

24:43.941 --> 24:47.525
Sir John has a flea
in his ear about scurvy.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.487
- He will ask.
- Something...

24:52.908 --> 24:55.491
transpired... at the end.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.621
He... He was seeing something
I couldn't see.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.617
Holding its gaze as if
it was in the room with us...

25:03.711 --> 25:06.875
Do I really need to explain
what is an hallucination?

25:06.964 --> 25:09.126
He had no fever. He was clear-eyed.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.752
Good night, Mr. Goodsir.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.690
Look at the snow
on those bergy bits.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.524
That's not summer break up.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.655
That's coming down from the north.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.204
It's pack ice.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.373
There are leads, but...

25:43.459 --> 25:45.451
How was the cold last night?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.036
It dropped. 20.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.417
Is <i>Erebus</i> aware?

25:54.470 --> 25:55.802
Well, no flags as yet.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.847
But no doubt they woke
thinking of their propeller.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.344
If Sir John doesn't convene
a meeting of the officers by ten,

26:04.438 --> 26:05.895
I'll do it myself.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.398
You're about to surpass us all, son.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.477
You're going somewhere
no man has ever been...

26:11.570 --> 26:13.106
not even a native.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.063
If it is ice wedged behind the propeller,

26:15.157 --> 26:16.568
and you can pry it out,

26:16.658 --> 26:20.151
well, you'll have grabbed
the ring twice in one morning.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.952
Right.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.963
Observe my signals.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.921
One pull on the tube
means half a fathom's slack.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.097
Two means the tube is kinked,
likely on the gunwale.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.015
Three... pull me up.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.854
If water floods the suit,

26:48.941 --> 26:50.477
it will be exponentially harder to lift me

26:50.567 --> 26:51.853
and exponentially more urgent,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.936
so all of you be ready on the line.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.322
There should be a surgeon here.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.492
They're just below, Mr. Collins. Proceed.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.081
You're a pilgrim to the deeps.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.664
And remember... God lies in all realms.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.375
Lower him in.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.351
Steady.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.157
Pull me up!

31:00.067 --> 31:02.525
You wouldn't call this cirrhotic.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.728
And there's gall.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.780
I don't see scurvy.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.860
- I don't see anything at all.
- Open the bowel.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.374
Propeller's bent.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.706
One of the blades...

31:24.800 --> 31:26.883
I pried some ice from behind.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.543
I think she'll spin now, sir.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.221
Is there
anything else to report?

31:34.643 --> 31:37.602
- No, sir.
- Capital job, Mr. Collins.

31:37.687 --> 31:41.601
Graham, let the engineers know
and signal <i>Terror.</i>

31:41.691 --> 31:43.728
Have Captain Crozier
bring his lieutenants over.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.776
- Sir.
- We need to confer

31:45.862 --> 31:48.229
about the ice that's in front of us now.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.990
I envy you, Mr. Collins.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.288
I have long wanted to move below.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.286
What was it like?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.874
Like a dream, sir.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.089
News is in about <i>Erebus.</i>

32:10.178 --> 32:13.171
While she can still make
headway under steam,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.599
the flagship's efficiency
has been compromised.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.268
How badly compromised?

32:19.354 --> 32:21.437
She can still pull two knots...
maybe three...

32:21.523 --> 32:22.809
with the boiler full up.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.765
- Half-power, more or less?
- Yes.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.944
As well,
we know that the ice ahead

32:28.029 --> 32:31.272
is increasing dramatically,
both in thickness and amount.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.609
But we must be nearly in sight
of King William Land.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.195
Then it isn't but another 200 miles

32:37.289 --> 32:39.497
before we can pick up the western charts

32:39.583 --> 32:42.872
and draw in this final piece
of the puzzle once and for all.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.452
Hear, hear.

32:44.546 --> 32:48.381
Our situation is more dire
than you may understand.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.174
Dramatic opening shot.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.798
Please, go ahead, Francis.

32:52.888 --> 32:57.474
That is not just ice ahead.
It is the pack.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.893
And you are proposing
that we cross it, in September.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.471
Even with leads, it could take us weeks

33:03.565 --> 33:06.023
of picking our way through it.

33:06.109 --> 33:09.728
- We may not have weeks.
- What, weeks at most?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.653
You've seen the sun dogs, Graham?

33:11.740 --> 33:13.652
How many have there been now?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.567
Three.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.994
It's already a colder year than last.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.321
I've been to the Arctic,

33:20.415 --> 33:21.826
- Francis.
- On foot.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.328
And you nearly starved.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.159
Not all of your men returned.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.710
I say this with all due honor.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.503
For God's sake, Francis.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.173
A captain is due his candor.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.751
So, what would you propose instead?

33:33.845 --> 33:36.462
- Wait out winter here?
- No.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.173
The exact shape of
King William Land is unknown.

33:39.267 --> 33:42.010
As we discovered with Cornwallis Land,

33:42.103 --> 33:43.514
it could be King William Island,

33:43.605 --> 33:45.847
with a chance to sail around
its eastern shore.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.398
Yes, but east would add miles.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.350
We might not be out this year after all.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.686
But only because <i>Erebus</i> is lame.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.067
If we consolidate all our coal

33:54.157 --> 33:56.114
on the less-damaged ship, we'd have enough

33:56.201 --> 33:59.035
to go for broke and get east
of King William Land...

33:59.120 --> 34:01.533
possibly around it... before winter.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.370
It's our best, and probably only, chance.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.123
Yes. We should go for broke.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.545
Abandon <i>Erebus?</i> Is...
Is that what you're saying?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.045
If it is a dead end, we can over-winter

34:13.134 --> 34:16.297
in complete safety out of the pack...

34:16.388 --> 34:18.129
in some sheltered harbor.

34:18.223 --> 34:21.216
We retrace our steps come spring...

34:21.309 --> 34:24.427
tired of one another, no doubt, but alive.

34:30.610 --> 34:34.353
That is an interesting... speculation.

34:36.074 --> 34:41.114
But, of course, we will not be
abandoning <i>Erebus,</i> nor <i>Terror,</i>

34:41.204 --> 34:44.447
should she suffer some minor misfortunes.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.413
- We are almost there...
- Hear me, John.

34:48.503 --> 34:53.668
It won't matter if we're 200
or 2,000 miles from safe water.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.341
If the leads close up
and we are out there in it,

34:56.428 --> 34:58.636
we'll have no idea where
the current will move the pack,

34:58.722 --> 35:01.305
of which we will be a part.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.008
We could be forced onto the shallows

35:04.102 --> 35:05.809
on the weather side of King William

35:05.895 --> 35:07.636
and crushed to atoms,

35:07.731 --> 35:10.098
if we're even upright by then.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.979
As a trusted friend once put it...

35:14.070 --> 35:16.153
this place wants us dead.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.860
Who is this friend?
Does he also write melodrama?

35:24.456 --> 35:29.121
Sir John, myself,
Mr. Blanky, and Mr. Reid.

35:29.210 --> 35:33.375
Only four of us at this table
are Arctic veterans.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.923
There'll be no melodramas here.

35:37.427 --> 35:41.011
Just live men... or dead men.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.718
It's certainly good to see color

35:47.812 --> 35:49.474
in your cheeks again, Francis.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.399
But we are two weeks
from finding the grail.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.479
And it is my belief that God and winter

35:57.572 --> 36:00.986
will find us in safe waters
by the end of the year.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.033
The Sandwich Islands. Or even further.

36:03.119 --> 36:06.988
If you're wrong, we are about
to commit an act of hubris...

36:07.082 --> 36:09.244
we may not survive.

36:10.919 --> 36:15.004
You know what men are like
when they are desperate.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.581
We both do.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.881
I shall continue to command from <i>Erebus,</i>

36:24.974 --> 36:27.057
but due to her injuries,

36:27.143 --> 36:29.681
I'm putting <i>Terror</i> in lead position.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.512
She may not be the better ice-breaker,

36:31.606 --> 36:33.723
but she's the more powerful ship now.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.853
Bury your boy... Young...
and we'll be on our way.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.031
West around King William Land as planned.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.576
- Bury?
- Yes. A mercy.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.904
It was a long night.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.877
All this when we could have
just dropped him overboard

36:58.967 --> 37:00.879
and been done with it.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.712
Sir John's a spiritual man.

37:03.805 --> 37:06.764
- I'd say an impractical one.
- Careful there.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.891
What, is that some kind
of treason, Sergeant?

37:18.319 --> 37:20.936
They shoulda run more nails
through that lid.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.736
Pull up the ropes
and fill it in, Mr. Hickey.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.909
- Me?
- Mr. Hornby tells me

37:26.995 --> 37:28.486
you have the most duty owing.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.617
Didn't tell me why.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.699
Grousing, probably.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.254
Are... Are we just gonna
leave it like that?

37:38.339 --> 37:41.298
Unless you want to climb in
there and fix it, yes, we are.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.966
Hop to it, Mr. Hickey.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.412
Mr. Hickey...

38:15.710 --> 38:17.793
It's not important.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.209
Sergeant Tozer said it's not important.

38:59.212 --> 39:01.579
Well, it would be to this boy's
father, wouldn't it?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.423
Hm?

39:06.261 --> 39:08.173
Help a mate up.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.846
And Jesus saith unto Thomas:

39:10.932 --> 39:14.676
"Because thou hast seen me,
thou hast believed...

39:14.769 --> 39:18.513
but blessed are they
that have not yet seen

39:18.606 --> 39:21.269
but still believe."

39:23.820 --> 39:28.485
And just as David Young is at the gates...

39:28.575 --> 39:30.862
so too are we.

39:30.952 --> 39:35.617
And now is our moment to stride
through them, to our glory,

39:35.707 --> 39:37.289
and to our destiny.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.539
I have set a course south south-west.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.168
We will see the North American
mainland within a fortnight,

39:45.258 --> 39:46.374
gentlemen.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.175
We must now begin
our last and best efforts

39:49.262 --> 39:50.628
to reach her,

39:50.722 --> 39:56.138
as we become the greatest
Argonauts of our age!

40:02.025 --> 40:06.895
We shall earn our loved ones'
cheers and embraces

40:06.988 --> 40:08.945
at our return.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.905
Onwards, men!

40:12.994 --> 40:14.826
All right, lads.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.951
Man the braces!

40:35.183 --> 40:38.347
- Hard to starboard!
- Hard to starboard it is, sir!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.928
- Hard to starboard!
- Go to it, man.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.059
Let's meet it with force.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.173
There should be more men picking here!

41:09.258 --> 41:12.001
Why is there only one man picking?

41:26.567 --> 41:29.025
All right, men, stand back!

41:32.490 --> 41:35.779
Right, everybody, fall back!

42:17.952 --> 42:20.740
Our Lord and Father will see us through.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.409
Whatever morning brings.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.379
Get the ice anchors up.
We're part of it now.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.331
Sir.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.291
Fix our position with care, Mr. Reid.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.127
I want to know exactly where we are

44:00.221 --> 44:02.053
in relation to King William Land.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.177
Yes, sir.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.804
When the men are fed,

44:06.894 --> 44:09.682
have them begin pulling the tarp up.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.560
Mr. Gregory can start drawing
down the engine for winter.

44:12.650 --> 44:16.610
Your demeanor should be
all cheer, gentlemen.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.817
You understand? It's going to be tight,

44:19.907 --> 44:21.648
but that's what we signed up for...

44:21.742 --> 44:23.654
an adventure for Queen and Country.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.237
An adventure of a lifetime.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.539
That's what you tell the men.
