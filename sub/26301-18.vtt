00:00.010 --> 00:01.479
This is Katie Otto.

00:01.480 --> 00:03.599
I am confirming that
the gender reveal cake

00:03.600 --> 00:06.119
will be ready for
pick-up this afternoon.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.219
Thank you.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.529
Gender reveal cake?

00:08.530 --> 00:11.029
When you cut into it, the
filling is either pink or blue

00:11.030 --> 00:13.119
to announce if the baby
is a boy or a girl.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.993
Aww, that's adorable!

00:14.994 --> 00:16.079
It's obnoxious.

00:16.079 --> 00:18.239
Have some class, and find out
the old-fashioned way...

00:18.240 --> 00:20.299
look at its junk when it
comes out of your body.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.909
Anna-Kat, stop!

00:21.910 --> 00:23.369
Give me back my phone, you little...

00:23.370 --> 00:25.003
Taylor, don't you dare!

00:25.004 --> 00:27.659
I'm the only one in this house
who is allowed to swear.

00:30.009 --> 00:31.399
- See?
- She was in my room,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.119
and she stole my phone again!

00:33.120 --> 00:35.029
She was on my Instagram,
liking my posts!

00:35.030 --> 00:37.079
Now, people think I'm
liking my own posts!

00:37.080 --> 00:38.779
Do you know how embarrassing that is?!

00:38.780 --> 00:40.579
Do you realize you only
have two voices...

00:40.580 --> 00:42.869
normal and... "My
parachute's not opening!"

00:42.870 --> 00:45.739
Stop taking Taylor's phone.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.779
Maybe she would stop if
she had her own phone.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.529
She's not getting a phone.

00:49.530 --> 00:52.599
No one in this house gets a
phone until they are 14.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.029
But every year, on your birthday,

00:54.030 --> 00:55.489
you say that age is just a number

00:55.490 --> 00:57.020
that means absolutely nothing.

00:58.030 --> 01:00.038
Greg...

01:00.039 --> 01:01.199
No phone for you.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.218
Thanks, honey.

01:04.220 --> 01:05.300
She had me boxed in.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.699
What kind of watch are you looking for?

01:17.700 --> 01:19.619
A knock-around one I can
wear with sneakers...

01:19.620 --> 01:21.529
mid-five-figures, tops.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.909
My friend at Numble told
me they're about to patent

01:23.910 --> 01:25.989
a new optical fiber technology.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.659
The news doesn't break until next week,

01:27.660 --> 01:28.869
so if you put down a little now,

01:28.870 --> 01:31.100
it'll be worth a fortune on Monday.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.073
Hey, I just overheard those
guys talking about a stock tip.

01:35.074 --> 01:37.409
If I invest what I've saved from
working at Tuscadero's Pizza,

01:37.410 --> 01:38.659
I could make some serious money.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.319
Amigo, you can't trust random guys

01:41.320 --> 01:44.759
to have legitimate information
about the market.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.909
Hold up. Prada suits, Gucci Oxfords,

01:47.910 --> 01:50.699
and their hair pomades have
hold but a matte finish.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.449
They check out.

01:52.450 --> 01:54.029
The problem is, I'm not 18,

01:54.030 --> 01:56.699
which means I can't open a
brokerage account on my own.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.819
I'll need my parents' help.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.098
I remember when I got my
first brokerage account.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.159
I called it my "bwo-bwo."

02:02.160 --> 02:03.489
I know. I was adorable.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.529
No. No, you weren't.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.529
I just want them to stop fighting.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.619
Anna-Kat keeps taking Taylor's phone,

02:11.620 --> 02:14.529
which is driving her crazy,
which is driving me crazy.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.989
So, get her her own phone.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.869
I got them for all my kids
so they'd leave me alone.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.529
My baby calls Siri "Mama".

02:20.530 --> 02:21.909
Okay, that's bananas.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.699
Phones are an epidemic with kids today.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.039
They destroy their social skills
and distort their self-worth.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.050
I'm with Angela.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.839
And research shows that they also stunt

02:28.840 --> 02:30.128
- brain development.
- 100%.

02:30.129 --> 02:32.199
That's why I sometimes
communicate with my kids

02:32.200 --> 02:34.619
silently through meditation.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.369
You always do that.

02:36.370 --> 02:37.739
You get me in the car with you,

02:37.740 --> 02:39.279
we are heading to the same destination,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.529
and then, you just veer
right off a cliff.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.799
If you don't want Anna-Kat
obsessing over a phone,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.369
then maybe get off yours.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.529
Lead by example.

02:49.530 --> 02:52.199
You know I don't do that.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.153
Oh, don't worry.

02:55.154 --> 02:56.699
Mama's coming.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.409
Bananas.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.579
Hey, Dad.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.529
Hey, Oliver.

03:04.530 --> 03:07.159
I was wondering if you'd help
me open a brokerage account.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.579
- I don't see why not.
- Great.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.799
I want to put all my money
into a company called Numble.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.019
Well, have you done your research?

03:13.020 --> 03:14.819
I overheard this Wall Street
guy talking about it.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.999
He had inside information.
It's a sure thing.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.519
Oliver, inside information

03:18.520 --> 03:21.520
is the same thing as insider
trading, and that's illegal.

03:22.030 --> 03:24.029
Illegal or frowned upon?

03:24.030 --> 03:25.179
Illegal!

03:25.180 --> 03:27.579
And there's no way I will
allow you to do that.

03:29.620 --> 03:30.800
What did you just say?

03:31.660 --> 03:33.699
Nothing.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.120
No, if you have something to
say, you say it to my face.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.659
Just because you're okay living
like the "before" picture

03:41.660 --> 03:43.119
in "Extreme Makeover Home Edition"

03:43.120 --> 03:44.899
doesn't mean you should expect me to.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.779
I'm not asking you to not have ambition,

03:46.780 --> 03:48.159
but I expect you to be honest.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.199
Fine. You've never taken one chance.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.481
You've always played it safe,
and look where it's got you.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.579
I take risks every day.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.199
Brown belt, black shoes...
that takes guts.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.980
Why am I talking to you?
You're color-blind.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.659
I'm finally fed up with him.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.759
Even if our theory is true

04:04.760 --> 04:06.599
that we brought the wrong
kid home from the hospital,

04:06.600 --> 04:08.319
we still had 15 years to fix him.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.960
It's starting to look
like this is on us.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.239
I'm super-busy right now.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.379
Can this just be on you?

04:12.380 --> 04:14.740
You said you had an easy day and
only had to pick up a cake.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.319
I forgot I told you that.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.238
I yell at him... That doesn't work.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.909
I try to lead by example... He
thinks I'm a cautionary tale.

04:22.910 --> 04:25.243
Leading by example is a
huge pain in the ass.

04:25.244 --> 04:27.419
Before you know it, you are
serving fruit for dessert

04:27.420 --> 04:28.429
like a damn animal.

04:28.430 --> 04:29.959
I just don't know how I'm
gonna get through to him.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.369
Well, maybe you have to
try something different.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.253
Whatever you normally would
do, do the opposite.

04:35.254 --> 04:36.449
Huh.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.159
Mom, I need you!

04:38.160 --> 04:40.239
Any chance she's calling
me up there for a hug?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.699
Or to show you her finished homework?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.369
Or to offer insightful commentary

04:43.370 --> 04:44.529
about a book she just read?

04:46.660 --> 04:48.369
Mom!

04:50.850 --> 04:51.959
Hey.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.119
You know your scenario where
you run away to Mexico?

04:54.120 --> 04:55.274
I'm going with you.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.279
Okay.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.819
But I'm going to need my
sexual freedom down there.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.269
Fine.

05:00.270 --> 05:03.119
But then my fanny pack and
ponytail are back on the table.

05:04.150 --> 05:05.283
Mom!

05:05.284 --> 05:06.619
What is it!

05:06.620 --> 05:08.029
Anna-Kat's been going through my things,

05:08.030 --> 05:09.579
and she stole my phone again!

05:09.580 --> 05:11.779
- I want it back.
- Relax.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.529
There is an easy way to find it.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.119
Huh.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.599
I found Taylor's phone.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.819
And I changed your wallpaper.

05:25.304 --> 05:27.750
Look, it's me waving.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.819
Hi.

05:29.820 --> 05:31.619
Mom, you need to get her her own phone!

05:31.620 --> 05:34.369
For the 100th time,
that is not happening.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.869
Then I have a better idea.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.199
Buy me a phone, and Anna-Kat
can have my old one.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.319
Everyone wins.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.239
When I was your age, there
were no cellphones,

05:41.240 --> 05:42.619
and I was better for it.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.699
I went out into the
world, talked to people,

05:44.700 --> 05:47.239
got strangers to buy me
beer outside 7-Eleven.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.779
It was an all-American childhood.

05:48.780 --> 05:49.869
Look at you now.

05:49.870 --> 05:51.419
You use your phone as much as anyone.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.759
But I don't need to.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.300
You couldn't survive a
single day without it.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.279
Is that what you think?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.079
It's what I know.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.019
Crap, I guess I have to lead by example.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.699
I should've just bred dogs.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.449
Okay. How about this...

06:06.450 --> 06:08.869
If I can go until tonight
without using my phone,

06:08.870 --> 06:11.079
then there will be no
more talk of Anna-Kat

06:11.080 --> 06:13.319
getting a phone until
I decide it's time.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.353
And if you use your phone,

06:15.354 --> 06:17.489
you have to buy me a new one,
and Anna-Kat gets my old one.

06:17.490 --> 06:18.869
You got it.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.659
But I'm going phone-free,
then you are, too.

06:21.660 --> 06:22.949
You can't do that to me!

06:22.950 --> 06:24.579
How will I know what's
happening in the world?!

06:24.580 --> 06:26.819
By opening your eyes and
participating in it.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.019
Disgusting.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.449
And to make sure that you don't cheat,

06:29.450 --> 06:32.079
you are coming with me to pick
up the cake for the baby shower.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.319
This is so not fair!

06:33.320 --> 06:36.529
You know what's not fair? What
you kids did to this body!

06:36.530 --> 06:38.489
I'm 9, Mom.

06:38.490 --> 06:41.139
You can't blame me for that
anymore. At some point,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.880
you have to start taking
some responsibility.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.369
Never.

06:53.559 --> 06:57.699
See, you made it here without using GPS.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.279
Am I the only one who noticed

06:59.280 --> 07:01.159
we drove past our own house twice?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.699
Okay. I'm gonna go pick up the cake,

07:02.700 --> 07:03.719
and then walk it to the restaurant

07:03.720 --> 07:04.779
where the baby shower is.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.989
You two just hang out on Main Street.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.573
I'll meet you back here in an hour.

07:08.574 --> 07:10.489
How are we supposed to
contact you if we need you?

07:10.490 --> 07:11.559
For thousands of years,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.340
when kids were away from their parents,

07:13.350 --> 07:15.079
they met at an agreed-upon time.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.619
But how will I know what time it is?

07:16.620 --> 07:18.583
- A clock?
- Disgusting.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.579
I should've known my
dad wouldn't help me.

07:23.580 --> 07:24.989
I wish I could offer some advice,

07:24.990 --> 07:27.239
but I have no experience in
not getting what I want.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.119
My dad's holding my
financial future hostage.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.529
He doesn't understand me.

07:32.530 --> 07:35.619
I wish I could talk to someone who does.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.119
Wait.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.604
Maybe I can.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.279
What's that?

07:45.280 --> 07:48.619
Spencer's lawyer gave
me these after he died.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.079
Spencer, the rich old guy
who lived across the street

07:51.080 --> 07:53.618
with the great tan and
the amazing laugh?

07:53.619 --> 07:55.319
Ha-ha-ha!

07:55.320 --> 07:57.120
Spencer was the best.

07:58.860 --> 08:01.239
He made these tapes to give me advice

08:01.240 --> 08:03.629
for every conceivable life situation.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.219
There must be something on these tapes

08:06.220 --> 08:07.319
that will help me.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.869
So, Ollie boy, here's
how you hide your money

08:09.870 --> 08:11.239
when the Feds are onto you.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.620
Interesting.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.369
So, Ollie boy, here's what you do

08:16.370 --> 08:18.643
when you sweat so much
while you're dancing

08:18.644 --> 08:20.779
you can't take off your leather pants.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.120
Ha-ha-ha.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.199
Ollie boy, this might not apply to you,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.699
but here's how you win
back Daryl Hannah.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.479
So, Ollie boy,

08:31.480 --> 08:32.989
you're wondering how much to tip

08:32.990 --> 08:35.198
your human sushi tray.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.438
Ollie boy, this is how you
make your first million.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.909
This is the one I was looking for.

08:39.909 --> 08:42.000
If you're watching this, my gut tells me

08:42.020 --> 08:44.119
you're sitting on something good.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.529
And if that's true,

08:45.530 --> 08:48.299
do whatever you have to
do to get the job done.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.409
Be ruthless.

08:50.410 --> 08:53.239
Feel free to call my
lawyer, Linda Ramirez.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.369
Now, she knows how to get things done.

08:56.370 --> 09:00.119
And if you're over 21, she's
fun to have a drink with.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.620
Ha-ha.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.489
I knew Spencer would
have the perfect advice.

09:05.490 --> 09:08.693
Would you mind if we circled
back to that Daryl Hannah tape?

09:08.694 --> 09:09.779
What?

09:09.780 --> 09:10.909
You're not curious?

09:15.450 --> 09:16.529
Hi.

09:16.530 --> 09:17.659
I'm here to pick up a cake.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.529
Okay. I'll just need your
confirmation number.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.279
Oh, sure.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.239
It's in my phone, which
I don't have on me.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.449
That's all right. I can
look it up in the system.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.713
- What's your name?
- Katie Otto.

09:28.714 --> 09:29.869
Here it is.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.699
Now, if I could just see some ID.

09:34.410 --> 09:36.279
Left my wallet in the car.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.819
Can you just take my word for it?

09:37.820 --> 09:39.159
I'm kind of in a hurry.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.199
I'm afraid not.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.659
It's against company policy.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.728
It's called Bernice's Cakes.

09:43.729 --> 09:45.079
You're Bernice.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.159
It's your policy.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.869
I can't break my own policy.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.079
How would that look to my employees?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.369
You're the only one here!

09:51.370 --> 09:52.779
I used to bring my dog to work,

09:52.780 --> 09:54.879
but the guy from the health
department got all in a tizzy!

09:54.880 --> 09:56.029
I'm gonna go get my ID.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.579
Anything else you need, Bernice?

09:57.580 --> 09:59.179
Fingerprints, blood samples?

09:59.180 --> 10:00.579
You want me to pee in a cup?

10:00.580 --> 10:02.579
Restrooms are for employees only.

10:02.580 --> 10:03.748
Company policy.

10:03.749 --> 10:05.409
I really don't like you, Bernice.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.279
I got mint chip.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.279
Want to try it before I'm done?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.529
Is this thing on?

10:14.530 --> 10:15.640
This is the worst.

10:15.650 --> 10:17.699
I can't take a photo of
my ice cream and post it.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.420
I mean, what's the point
of just eating it?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.629
_

10:29.000 --> 10:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.370 --> 10:39.449
Okay. Spencer's lawyer said my
best option is to emancipate.

10:39.450 --> 10:40.799
What exactly does that mean?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.909
They give up their parental rights,

10:41.910 --> 10:43.279
and then, I'm legally an adult.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.119
Then, I can spend money
on whatever stock I want.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.129
And once you're legal,

10:46.130 --> 10:48.279
you can take us to Enterprise
and rent us a Corolla.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.859
You have, like, 15 Maseratis.

10:49.860 --> 10:51.029
Why would you want to rent a car?

10:51.030 --> 10:53.798
Sometimes, it's just fun
to live like a normie.

10:53.799 --> 10:55.239
That's what I call you guys.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.199
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.119
It says here, in order to emancipate,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.199
your parents have to sign off on it.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.369
Or you could take them to
court, and let a judge decide.

11:04.370 --> 11:05.679
Okay.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.240
Like Spencer said,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.319
I have to do whatever I have to do.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.489
Be ruthless.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.079
You want to know how I
made my first million?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.818
I can't imagine I want to hear this.

11:13.819 --> 11:15.819
I beat my dad in mini-golf when I was 6.

11:21.870 --> 11:24.420
Damn it. Taylor's got the keys.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.833
And I don't have my phone!

11:30.080 --> 11:32.319
You know what? I'll just find them.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.779
Excuse me, did you happen to
see my daughters walk by?

11:42.780 --> 11:45.459
A blonde about this tall and
a brunette about this tall?

11:45.460 --> 11:47.369
- Do you have a picture?
- I have like 1,000,

11:47.370 --> 11:49.299
but they're on my phone,
and I don't have it.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.369
Oh. Why not?

11:50.370 --> 11:52.119
Because I'm trying to set a
good example for my kids

11:52.120 --> 11:53.858
by not relying on phones.

11:53.859 --> 11:55.409
You know what, that's a good point.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.409
I've been spending too
much time on my phone.

11:57.410 --> 12:00.259
And if it's not my phone,
it's my TV or my iPad,

12:00.260 --> 12:01.869
and then, there's the computer.

12:01.870 --> 12:03.239
Oh, and do you know about these watches?

12:03.240 --> 12:04.780
I don't have time for this.

12:06.030 --> 12:08.140
Hey, you started talking to me, lady!

12:10.820 --> 12:11.989
Try one on!

12:11.990 --> 12:13.879
Nah, I'm good.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.920
Here.

12:21.030 --> 12:22.799
Perfect.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.489
You look like Sadness from "Inside Out."

12:46.580 --> 12:49.529
We should do matching fake eyelashes!

12:49.530 --> 12:51.699
God, I hope Mom's cheating
and using her phone

12:51.700 --> 12:53.579
so I can get a new one.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.869
Can you stop worrying about
your phone for 10 minutes?

12:56.870 --> 12:59.139
You should hope she's cheating, too,

12:59.140 --> 13:01.529
- so you get one, as well.
- I don't want one.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.119
Then why do you keep stealing mine?

13:03.120 --> 13:06.489
I wasn't stealing it
because I wanted a phone!

13:06.490 --> 13:08.933
You are so stupid!

13:08.934 --> 13:10.659
The only reason I'm stupid today

13:10.660 --> 13:12.909
is because I don't have a
phone to be smart for me!

13:19.990 --> 13:22.199
Hey.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.369
Have you come to apologize?

13:23.370 --> 13:25.869
No. But after consideration
and some counsel,

13:25.870 --> 13:27.319
I made a decision.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.799
If you don't buy that stock for me,

13:28.800 --> 13:30.659
I'm gonna be forced to
take you and Mom to court

13:30.660 --> 13:32.319
to get myself emancipated.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.489
Emanci...

13:35.740 --> 13:37.529
Do the opposite.

13:37.530 --> 13:38.963
Emancipated. I see.

13:38.964 --> 13:41.029
I'm afraid you've left me no choice.

13:41.030 --> 13:42.119
Okey dokey.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.699
- That's it?
- Yes Siree Bob.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.369
I guess I'll see you in court, then.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.420
Not if I see you first.

13:58.984 --> 14:00.159
Here's the cake.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.529
Let me box it for you.

14:01.530 --> 14:05.029
So, unfortunately, my wallet
is locked in the car,

14:05.030 --> 14:06.699
and my daughter has the keys.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.159
- Can't you call her?
- No. I can't.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.619
I don't have a phone.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.239
Oh, right, right.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.779
Ooh, maybe you could
shoot her an e-mail.

14:14.780 --> 14:18.319
Again, I can't, Bernice,
because I don't have...

14:18.320 --> 14:19.529
I see what you're doing.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.199
Welcome to Bernice's Cakes.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.579
This is my house!

14:22.580 --> 14:24.699
Bernice, could you just
give me a break, here?

14:24.700 --> 14:26.909
If I don't get this cake to a
baby shower in 10 minutes,

14:26.910 --> 14:28.409
I could lose my job.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.739
If I give this cake
away without proper ID,

14:30.740 --> 14:32.029
I could lose my job!

14:32.030 --> 14:33.119
You own the place!

14:33.120 --> 14:36.009
- You'd be firing yourself!
- It's company policy!

14:37.200 --> 14:39.020
Excuse me.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.400
Bernice's Cakes. Bernice speaking.

14:43.660 --> 14:44.739
Mm-hmm.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.659
Hey, stop!

14:57.080 --> 14:59.620
It's a girl!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.410
Mm-hmm.

15:11.530 --> 15:13.739
What's going on?

15:13.740 --> 15:16.319
You never want to hang out.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.799
You're so busy on your phone,

15:17.800 --> 15:19.909
giving likes to everyone but me.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.982
- I like you.
- You don't act like it.

15:21.983 --> 15:23.699
That's why I steal your phone.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.869
It's the only way you'll
give me any attention.

15:25.870 --> 15:28.599
I'm 17. You're 9.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.460
So, I'm...

15:31.540 --> 15:32.989
Eight...

15:32.990 --> 15:35.040
... eight years older than you.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.239
We're just at different stages
of our lives right now.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.079
But we're sisters.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.599
Eight years is nothing

15:40.600 --> 15:43.409
when you think we'll be
together our whole lives.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.659
We're going to go on
cruises together with Mom

15:45.660 --> 15:47.000
after Dad dies.

15:48.870 --> 15:51.280
I never meant to make you
feel like I didn't like you.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.529
And I promise, I'll look up
from my phone more often,

15:55.530 --> 15:57.019
and spend more time with you.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.619
There you two are!

16:02.620 --> 16:04.159
What happened to you?

16:04.160 --> 16:05.529
I need to take a picture of this.

16:07.029 --> 16:08.029
Damn it!

16:08.030 --> 16:09.540
Mom, give me your phone.

16:10.490 --> 16:11.579
Damn it!

16:14.560 --> 16:16.190
_

16:27.049 --> 16:29.659
So, Ollie boy, you're getting married.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.639
Let's talk prenup.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.369
I remember when I got married
for the second time.

16:34.370 --> 16:37.058
Gabby. We met at a nightclub.

16:37.059 --> 16:40.199
I owned the club, but
she owned my heart...

16:40.200 --> 16:43.319
and half my stuff after the divorce.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.029
Wait, Gabby was my third wife.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.069
Who the hell was my second wife?

16:53.700 --> 16:57.078
My dad seems fine with
me being emancipated.

16:57.079 --> 16:59.739
If you were here, you'd
tell me how to play this,

16:59.740 --> 17:02.084
and then laugh for no reason.

17:08.530 --> 17:09.949
You sure you want to go through with

17:09.950 --> 17:12.093
this whole emancipation thing?

17:12.094 --> 17:14.368
I guess.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.029
You never let anyone stand in the way

17:16.030 --> 17:17.259
of getting what you wanted in life.

17:17.260 --> 17:21.659
That's true. But then again,
maybe I'm not the best example.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.529
You'll notice these tapes are all about

17:23.530 --> 17:27.108
how to get yourself out
of bad situations.

17:28.369 --> 17:29.409
This one is you telling me

17:29.410 --> 17:30.909
how you kept your wife and mistress

17:30.910 --> 17:32.579
from finding out about your girlfriend.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.159
Maybe... Maybe it's best

17:34.160 --> 17:36.150
if you don't get yourself
into these situations

17:36.160 --> 17:37.170
to begin with.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.699
You know, I think that's, uh...

17:40.700 --> 17:42.123
what your father's trying to tell you.

17:42.124 --> 17:43.949
But this could be my big break.

17:43.950 --> 17:46.029
You'll have plenty of big breaks,

17:46.030 --> 17:48.739
but you only have one father.

17:48.740 --> 17:52.133
You should be in no hurry
to get rid of him.

17:52.134 --> 17:54.029
Remember what I used to tell you?

17:54.030 --> 17:55.989
You're a good person.

17:55.990 --> 17:59.029
And the first step in
being a good person

17:59.030 --> 18:01.779
is knowing when you're wrong.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.199
And the next step

18:03.200 --> 18:05.989
is rewarding yourself for doing right

18:05.990 --> 18:09.029
with a nice, crisp, nudie mag.

18:11.620 --> 18:13.779
I wish you were here.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.780
You and me both, kiddo.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.989
You and me both.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.159
I'm here! I'm here.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.479
I had a little trouble with
my order at Bernice's Cakes.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.319
They should call it
"Bernice's Attitude,"

18:31.320 --> 18:33.159
because that's all she offers.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.579
She did this to me.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.159
Then, I had to drive to the
other bakery on the Post Road.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.279
We would've called ahead,

18:38.280 --> 18:40.119
but she was trying to teach us a lesson.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.699
- Totally backfired.
- But I'm here!

18:42.700 --> 18:43.779
Just in time.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.319
Mrs. Otto, did nobody call you?

18:45.320 --> 18:46.739
The baby shower was canceled.

18:46.740 --> 18:49.029
The mother woke up with a bad cold.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.449
Gosh, if only you'd had your phone,

18:51.450 --> 18:54.380
you wouldn't be wearing a
cake that nobody wanted.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.869
Do you have a back office or something,

18:57.870 --> 19:00.710
where someone can discretely
beat their child?

19:01.820 --> 19:02.989
Of course. Right this way.

19:09.870 --> 19:12.213
Oliver.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.369
I'm sorry for how I
spoke to you earlier,

19:15.370 --> 19:16.940
and for threatening to emancipate.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.529
The truth is, I realized I'm lucky

19:20.530 --> 19:22.780
to have a rule-following
father looking out for me.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.079
That's nice of you to say.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.519
Even if it makes it harder for
me to crawl out of the belly

19:27.520 --> 19:28.699
of the lower class.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.699
- Getting less nice.
- I want you to know

19:30.700 --> 19:33.119
that I'm still gonna
be super rich one day.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.819
I'm just gonna do it in a
way that makes you proud.

19:36.820 --> 19:38.159
I'm happy to hear that.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.243
Oh.

19:42.244 --> 19:44.369
I also found a Spencer tape titled

19:44.370 --> 19:47.248
"What To Do With Your Pet
Tiger Once It's Grown Up".

19:47.249 --> 19:49.199
I think it'd be useful for you with Mom.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.619
A lot of it applies.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.119
Five-card draw. Play is to you.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.263
Go fish!

20:02.264 --> 20:03.699
Those eight years between us

20:03.700 --> 20:05.529
really don't make that
much of a difference.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.679
That's it! It totally sucked,

20:07.680 --> 20:09.529
but I made it through
the rest of the day

20:09.530 --> 20:11.279
without using my phone.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.779
Now, Anna-Kat can never ask
again about getting a phone

20:14.780 --> 20:16.159
until I decide it's time.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.959
- Fine by me.
- And, Taylor,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.159
you're not getting a new phone.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.159
Fine by me.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.369
I see what's going on.

20:23.370 --> 20:27.288
You're trying to confuse me,
but it's not gonna work.

20:27.289 --> 20:28.319
I'm on to you.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.659
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.779
Ooh, you guys are good.

20:32.780 --> 20:35.819
Could you please leave?
We're having sister time.

20:35.820 --> 20:37.909
Isn't that what you wanted?

20:37.910 --> 20:39.909
Yeah, but it's weird.

20:39.910 --> 20:41.519
If you're not upset and screaming at me,

20:41.520 --> 20:42.920
it doesn't feel like I've won.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.779
I led by example, and somehow it worked.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.079
Nobody wants a phone anymore,

20:49.080 --> 20:50.659
and the girls are
spending time together.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.239
- Oh. Good for you.
- Is it?

20:52.240 --> 20:54.869
If I have to lead by
example all the time,

20:54.870 --> 20:56.449
it's gonna be a nightmare.

20:56.450 --> 20:59.319
No more complimentary bags of
Doritos at the supermarket.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.879
Well, I stopped leading by example

21:00.880 --> 21:02.409
and got a positive result.

21:02.410 --> 21:05.319
I washed my hands of Oliver,
and he came crawling back.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.819
Now, he says he wants
to be a better person.

21:06.820 --> 21:07.953
So, what are we saying?

21:07.954 --> 21:09.699
I guess there's no one way to parent.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.989
And...

21:10.990 --> 21:13.199
And you can do whatever you
want at the supermarket.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.449
Oh, thank God.

21:14.450 --> 21:16.279
Can I still help myself
to teeth whitening strips

21:16.280 --> 21:17.739
- while I'm shopping?
- You do that?

21:17.740 --> 21:19.960
No. Never.
