WEBVTT

00:02.792 --> 00:04.139
I'm asking you to marry me.

00:04.143 --> 00:06.574
We might as well
just go to Vegas and elope.

00:06.580 --> 00:09.854
If we're gonna have a family we'll need
to turn the second bedroom into a nursery.

00:09.864 --> 00:11.736
But.. that's where Jake stays.

00:11.737 --> 00:14.969
Yeah, but once Alan moves out, then Jake
won't be staying here anymore, right?

00:14.976 --> 00:17.444
- Alan is moving out?
- Of course he is...

00:18.643 --> 00:19.484
Isn't he?

00:19.485 --> 00:21.475
I said the wedding's off.

00:21.478 --> 00:23.292
Can I borrow your wedding ring?

00:23.293 --> 00:24.197
What for?

00:24.209 --> 00:26.364
I thought as long we are in Vegas...

00:26.365 --> 00:28.049
I'd marry Kandy.

00:28.756 --> 00:31.503
And I now pronounce you man and wife,
you may kiss the bride.

00:31.522 --> 00:33.744
I don't freaking believe it!

00:33.745 --> 00:36.808
Cheer up Charlie, you're finally
getting what you always wanted,

00:36.812 --> 00:38.343
I'm moving out of your house!

00:38.355 --> 00:41.100
I don't freaking believe it!

00:44.255 --> 00:46.512
Do we have time to play
roulette before we go?

00:46.512 --> 00:49.919
Oh honey, that is a sucker's game,
the odds are totally stacked against you

00:49.934 --> 00:53.195
Ooooh...Super Slots'o'Fun Jackpot!

00:54.764 --> 00:57.338
Sure... Make the smart bet.

00:58.301 --> 01:00.549
Here honey, kiss it
before I put it in.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.770
And the honeymoon begins...

01:03.831 --> 01:07.274
Slots'o'Fun, get it?
It's lots of fun!

01:08.579 --> 01:11.084
I'm ready for a refill.

01:16.202 --> 01:18.026
Is that good?

01:20.779 --> 01:22.335
I won...

01:23.689 --> 01:26.368
I won a half a million dollars!

01:28.754 --> 01:31.267
I don't freaking believe it...

01:31.865 --> 01:33.251
Alan, you're rich!

01:33.257 --> 01:36.966
No we're rich!
We're married now, what's mine is yours!

01:37.305 --> 01:38.834
Really?

01:39.335 --> 01:41.647
And the honeymoon ends...

02:04.319 --> 02:05.884
Excuse me?

02:05.904 --> 02:07.370
You know where Charlie is?

02:07.371 --> 02:09.047
Who's Charlie?

02:15.559 --> 02:16.457
Charlie?

02:16.466 --> 02:17.607
You're in here?

02:17.657 --> 02:19.788
Hey hey, Alan!

02:19.821 --> 02:21.383
Long time no see!

02:21.387 --> 02:22.763
Say hello to my brother Alan.

02:22.769 --> 02:23.923
Hi Alan.

02:23.941 --> 02:25.220
Hi Alan.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.661
Hi Alan.

02:28.673 --> 02:30.090
I'm interrupting...

02:30.090 --> 02:31.980
Gee... You think?

02:34.450 --> 02:38.295
Listen, I really need to talk to you,
can you come downstairs?

02:38.432 --> 02:39.305
Sure!

02:39.332 --> 02:40.357
Give me...

02:41.470 --> 02:42.849
an hour and a half.

02:42.974 --> 02:44.119
An hour and a half?

02:44.123 --> 02:47.372
I know it's a little rushed,
but we're on a tight schedule here.

02:47.390 --> 02:50.638
Tina's got homework, Cindy's got
to meet her fiancé, and Mary...

02:50.644 --> 02:52.863
Well Mary's on the clock.

02:52.984 --> 02:56.237
You already had two women in bed and
you felt the need to call a professional?

02:56.457 --> 02:58.464
Better safe than sorry.

02:59.068 --> 03:01.562
I see, well I guess
I'll just wait downstairs.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.396
Good call,
'cause you know...

03:03.543 --> 03:05.206
"five's a crowd".

03:08.021 --> 03:10.984
OK, does everybody
remember their assignment?

03:11.263 --> 03:13.029
- Yeah.
- Think so.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.276
Then let's do this thing.

03:27.622 --> 03:30.011
Hour and a half on the dot!

03:30.700 --> 03:32.766
Can I plan or what?

03:33.875 --> 03:36.550
Hey, come on, show a little class...

03:40.410 --> 03:42.785
So, how's the newly wed?

03:42.831 --> 03:44.383
Still living the dream?

03:44.598 --> 03:46.405
- Well...
- I gotta tell you buddy,

03:46.411 --> 03:48.694
things haven't been the same
around here since you left.

03:48.761 --> 03:52.148
- That's nice but...
- Yeah they've been way better.

03:52.226 --> 03:53.490
I mean look around.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.714
I don't even know these people.

03:57.492 --> 04:00.202
And I can have sex
in every room in the house now.

04:00.203 --> 04:03.599
I had forgotten how much fun
you can have on top of a washing machine.

04:03.604 --> 04:06.423
You know, hubada, hubada...

04:06.758 --> 04:08.784
- That, that does sound like fun but...
- And the best part of all

04:08.804 --> 04:10.001
is without Jake here,

04:10.004 --> 04:11.866
Mom has no reason to visit!

04:11.876 --> 04:15.207
Heck, I may not have to see her again
till we meet in hell!

04:15.252 --> 04:17.942
- I'm happy for you but...
- And to think of it, without Jake here,

04:17.956 --> 04:20.216
there's no reason
for you to visit either.

04:20.224 --> 04:21.333
I'm your brother!

04:21.351 --> 04:24.043
Yeah so, I'm your brother,
I don't visit you!

04:24.066 --> 04:25.544
Charlie, listen to me,

04:25.754 --> 04:27.433
my wife threw me out!

04:27.756 --> 04:29.148
Oh dude...

04:29.580 --> 04:31.117
- It's awful.
- Yeah.

04:33.368 --> 04:35.639
Well, thanks for stopping by...

04:36.537 --> 04:40.434
Aren't you listening to me? Kandi doesn't
love me anymore, my marriage is over,

04:40.435 --> 04:42.308
my life is in ruins.

04:43.314 --> 04:44.248
Oh...

04:44.613 --> 04:45.412
What?

04:45.415 --> 04:47.095
Déjà vu.

04:48.978 --> 04:52.887
It's as if I lived through this before,
and didn't really enjoy it!

04:52.893 --> 04:54.535
- Charlie, I, I...
- But wait!

04:54.700 --> 04:56.084
There's a difference,

04:56.192 --> 04:57.809
This time,
you can get your own place

04:57.811 --> 05:00.498
instead of sponging off me,
'cause you have money now, right?

05:01.205 --> 05:02.101
Uh, well...

05:02.110 --> 05:04.115
Ooooh you suck!

05:04.127 --> 05:06.353
It wasn't my fault!
There were taxes,

05:06.365 --> 05:08.262
and the condo, and and...

05:08.275 --> 05:10.666
Kandi's new car,
and Kandi's new clothes,

05:10.682 --> 05:13.978
And the shoes,
oh God so many shoes...

05:14.062 --> 05:15.544
How much do you have left?

05:20.635 --> 05:22.150
11 dollars.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.177
OK, OK, let's start
from the beginning...

05:24.194 --> 05:25.881
Well, things were fine
until about a month ago...

05:25.885 --> 05:27.427
No no no.

05:27.638 --> 05:28.585
I'll go back upstairs,

05:28.586 --> 05:31.225
you'll come knock on my door again,
and say you want to talk to me.

05:31.235 --> 05:32.187
Only this time,

05:32.194 --> 05:33.717
I kill you!

05:34.795 --> 05:37.268
Come on,
you're all I have left in this world!

05:37.280 --> 05:39.103
I need you Charlie!

05:43.249 --> 05:45.899
Anybody here know a Charlie?

05:51.677 --> 05:53.757
Oh Jeez...

05:54.441 --> 05:56.801
I'm working for Caligula.

06:02.323 --> 06:03.168
Hi Berta.

06:03.186 --> 06:04.588
Hey Zippy!

06:04.589 --> 06:06.340
What are you doing here?

06:07.427 --> 06:08.852
My marriage is over.

06:09.207 --> 06:10.395
Kandi kicked me out.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.422
Damn, that's horrible...

06:12.437 --> 06:13.486
Yeah.

06:14.048 --> 06:16.768
Damn! Damn! Damn!

06:16.781 --> 06:17.960
Tell me about it.

06:17.976 --> 06:20.260
I had October in the pool.

06:23.619 --> 06:25.508
Pool? What pool?

06:25.517 --> 06:28.223
Me, your brother, your mom,
a couple of neighbors had a pool

06:28.232 --> 06:30.848
on how long
before she dumped your ass.

06:31.543 --> 06:33.170
I was so close!

06:33.187 --> 06:35.281
You were betting that
my marriage was gonna fail?

06:35.293 --> 06:36.356
No.

06:36.359 --> 06:38.359
We were betting on when.

06:39.828 --> 06:41.788
So Charlie took you back, huh?

06:41.795 --> 06:44.063
Well... not with open arms or...

06:44.064 --> 06:45.717
an open heart or...

06:45.750 --> 06:47.505
even an open door.
After he pushed me out,

06:47.508 --> 06:49.794
I had to climb in through the window.

06:51.461 --> 06:53.116
But yeah, I'm back.

06:53.128 --> 06:54.683
Well, I'm glad.

06:55.369 --> 06:57.162
- You're kidding?
- No!

06:57.400 --> 06:58.298
With you and the kid around,

06:58.299 --> 07:01.604
I won't have to hose down
the washing machine so often.

07:02.928 --> 07:04.599
I'll get that.

07:09.814 --> 07:12.965
I guess there's no
trusting this butter now...

07:14.684 --> 07:16.587
or the loose bananas...

07:21.729 --> 07:22.853
Hello Alan.

07:23.247 --> 07:24.230
Judith...

07:24.568 --> 07:25.729
Hey dad.

07:25.898 --> 07:27.210
Hey buddy.

07:31.832 --> 07:35.379
So is somebody gonna explain to me
what the heck is going on?

07:36.803 --> 07:38.748
I thought he should hear it from you.

07:40.922 --> 07:43.213
Jake listen... I know...

07:43.231 --> 07:47.180
you liked Kandi very much,
but she and I have decided that

07:47.189 --> 07:48.932
we really can't stay married.

07:48.944 --> 07:49.907
Oh man!

07:49.914 --> 07:52.006
That doesn't mean that
you can't be friends with her...

07:52.025 --> 07:54.127
No, I had December!

07:58.093 --> 08:03.235
Alan, I just want to say I'm very sorry
things didn't work out for you and Kandi.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.246
Thanks...

08:06.238 --> 08:08.365
You won the pool, didn't you?

08:08.373 --> 08:09.787
Yeah.

08:10.070 --> 08:12.079
And just FYI, I spoke to my lawyer,

08:12.087 --> 08:14.568
and he said that even if Kandi
takes you for everything you've got,

08:14.569 --> 08:17.435
you'll still have to pay me alimony,
here's his bill.

08:21.598 --> 08:23.694
600 dollars!?

08:23.707 --> 08:26.069
He explained it very slowly.

08:35.753 --> 08:37.144
You didn't call.

08:37.155 --> 08:38.109
What?

08:38.120 --> 08:41.445
When dad moved out, you said you and me
could still get together and do stuff.

08:41.451 --> 08:43.164
But you never called.

08:43.864 --> 08:46.219
Oh jeez Jake, I'm sorry.

08:46.306 --> 08:47.673
I waited.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.975
I'll make it up to you.

08:49.975 --> 08:50.808
When?

08:50.825 --> 08:52.078
Later.

08:56.045 --> 08:57.452
I'm still here.

08:59.082 --> 09:00.782
What do you want me to do, Jake?

09:00.783 --> 09:04.175
I don't know, you really let me down,
and it hurt my feelings.

09:04.187 --> 09:06.184
I know, I feel awful.

09:06.195 --> 09:08.792
Fifty bucks, and it goes away.

09:09.686 --> 09:11.167
- Ten.
- Done.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.865
I love you Uncle Charlie.

09:14.285 --> 09:15.724
Back at ya'.

09:20.175 --> 09:22.066
How long is he gonna sit out there?

09:22.358 --> 09:23.415
I don't know Jake.

09:23.422 --> 09:24.863
He's pretty depressed.

09:24.874 --> 09:25.523
Yeah.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.798
Well that's the prize you pay
when you think with your penis.

09:29.992 --> 09:31.296
Did you hear that from your mother?

09:31.311 --> 09:33.018
No, your mother.

09:34.348 --> 09:35.839
And how are you feeling about all this?

09:35.845 --> 09:36.908
I'm OK.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.752
You sure?

09:37.773 --> 09:40.560
Uncle Charlie,
this is not my first divorce.

09:41.562 --> 09:42.732
Got it.

09:42.745 --> 09:45.626
Tell you one thing though,
I'm never getting married.

09:45.643 --> 09:47.984
That's a sweet dream to have, Jake.

09:48.747 --> 09:51.004
Sooner or later,
you're gonna meet a girl who's smart,

09:51.005 --> 09:53.999
beautiful and has
a real grudge against her parents.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.453
What are you gonna do then?

09:55.459 --> 09:57.182
Don't worry, I have a plan.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.073
Really?

09:58.086 --> 09:59.894
Yeah, if a girl falls in love with me,

09:59.895 --> 10:02.373
I'll tell her I can't marry her
until I have enough money,

10:02.391 --> 10:04.690
even though I'll be secretly rich.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.022
How do you plan to get secretly rich?

10:07.026 --> 10:09.438
I'm gonna marry a movie star.

10:11.118 --> 10:12.759
You're gonna marry a movie star

10:12.760 --> 10:14.456
to avoid getting married?

10:15.526 --> 10:17.966
Didn't say I had worked out all the bugs.

10:18.347 --> 10:19.264
Well,

10:19.283 --> 10:20.967
keep me posted.

10:26.088 --> 10:27.016
Hey.

10:27.572 --> 10:28.674
Hey.

10:30.754 --> 10:33.003
Jake sure changed
in the last few months.

10:33.152 --> 10:35.747
Starting to see a real little man there.

10:37.521 --> 10:39.767
Not a real bright little man...

10:41.168 --> 10:42.158
So what 'you doing?

10:42.176 --> 10:43.721
Making plans...

10:43.729 --> 10:46.009
Do they involve marrying a movie star?

10:46.075 --> 10:46.754
What?

10:46.754 --> 10:49.163
Nothing, nothing...
What's your plan?

10:49.176 --> 10:52.392
Well, I figured I'd have a nice big lunch,

10:52.394 --> 10:53.832
get real drunk,

10:53.836 --> 10:57.845
stroll down to the beach
and try to swim to Japan...

10:59.229 --> 11:00.479
Why the lunch?

11:00.621 --> 11:04.267
I want to cramp up and drown
before the sharks rip me to shreds.

11:04.482 --> 11:05.469
Well,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.267
keep me posted.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.067
I'm a failure, Charlie.

11:10.933 --> 11:16.274
Everything I've tried to do in my life
has ended in complete, abject, failure.

11:16.615 --> 11:17.417
Buddy...

11:17.429 --> 11:20.058
- you're looking at this the wrong way...
- See...

11:20.132 --> 11:22.025
I've failed again...

11:22.783 --> 11:24.949
Will you shut up and listen to me?

11:25.050 --> 11:29.835
Failure is nothing to be ashamed of,
it's a part of life, it's how we learn.

11:29.835 --> 11:31.044
You know what?

11:31.548 --> 11:33.941
I've failed for almost forty years.

11:34.117 --> 11:35.444
And what have I learned?

11:38.875 --> 11:41.156
Oh, that wasn't a rhetorical question?

11:42.677 --> 11:46.108
Come on Alan, you've got
to have a sense of humor about this...

11:46.108 --> 11:48.599
A broke-ass, middle-aged guy
marries a...

11:48.600 --> 11:52.957
22 year-old knucklehead just before
he wins a half a million dollars.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.870
And then she takes him
for everything he's got?

11:56.377 --> 11:58.162
That's hilarious.

12:00.006 --> 12:02.871
OK, maybe you're
too close to it now, but...

12:02.876 --> 12:04.896
trust me, it's funny!

12:13.373 --> 12:16.500
Where are you going?
The ocean is that way!

12:25.507 --> 12:28.082
Hey, the kid and I are going
to the movies, you want to come?

12:28.083 --> 12:29.298
No thanks...

12:29.468 --> 12:30.590
Can I get you something to eat?

12:30.609 --> 12:31.570
No...

12:31.572 --> 12:32.828
Something to drink?

12:32.830 --> 12:33.779
No...

12:33.786 --> 12:36.465
How about a bottle of scotch
and a hooker?

12:37.183 --> 12:38.955
I just want to be alone...

12:38.971 --> 12:40.901
Well, you don't need my help for that.

12:41.181 --> 12:42.696
That's your home-run swing.

12:42.710 --> 12:45.205
Just close the door on the way out.

12:45.206 --> 12:46.515
Fine, I'll close it.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.012
Then I'll nail it shut and

12:48.022 --> 12:49.016
plaster it over and

12:49.020 --> 12:51.107
hang a picture of something
a little more cheerful,

12:51.108 --> 12:53.657
like a plane crash.

12:56.149 --> 12:57.264
OK,

12:57.976 --> 13:01.289
I am through feeling sorry for myself.

13:04.077 --> 13:05.636
Maybe not.

13:10.095 --> 13:11.183
Alan?

13:11.203 --> 13:13.153
Oooh terrific.

13:13.995 --> 13:17.557
Charlie told me about
you and Kandi, I'm so sorry.

13:17.570 --> 13:19.442
Yeah well, thanks.

13:19.449 --> 13:21.740
Did he also tell you I want to be alone?

13:21.749 --> 13:23.031
Yes he did.

13:23.502 --> 13:24.915
So...

13:24.916 --> 13:26.831
want some company?

13:28.163 --> 13:29.090
No.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.219
How about a hug?

13:30.221 --> 13:32.795
Is it a goodbye hug?

13:34.621 --> 13:35.756
Alan,

13:36.278 --> 13:39.055
I know what it's like
to lose at love.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.105
Rose?

13:40.108 --> 13:41.308
Yes, baby?

13:41.929 --> 13:43.782
You're a stalker.

13:45.085 --> 13:48.189
I prefer to be called "boundary challenged".

13:50.152 --> 13:51.578
Just go away...

13:51.593 --> 13:53.126
"Go away"?!

13:53.139 --> 13:55.371
Alan, I'm a stalker.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.286
Trust me, this pain will pass.

14:00.294 --> 14:02.778
The aching emptiness
that's swallowing up your heart

14:02.797 --> 14:05.371
will be transformed
into something beautiful.

14:05.383 --> 14:06.650
What's that?

14:09.669 --> 14:11.572
Resentment.

14:13.529 --> 14:14.794
A burning,

14:14.797 --> 14:20.696
white, hot resentment that empowers you
to commit unspeakable actions.

14:21.615 --> 14:23.852
You're gonna want a scrapbook.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.196
Dad?

14:32.324 --> 14:33.249
Yeah?

14:33.262 --> 14:36.322
Uncle Charlie is gonna take me
back to Mom's now...

14:36.346 --> 14:38.407
Come in here and say goodbye.

14:39.889 --> 14:40.921
Bye.

14:41.806 --> 14:42.990
That's it? 

14:43.019 --> 14:45.368
Come here and give your old dad a hug.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.636
That's better...

14:54.473 --> 14:55.707
You're still depressed?

14:55.718 --> 14:57.707
Oh no no, I'm fine.

14:58.422 --> 14:59.803
Just taking a little nap.

14:59.809 --> 15:02.264
You've been napping for two days..

15:02.265 --> 15:04.202
I'm getting old, Jake.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.296
Old people nap a lot.

15:07.065 --> 15:09.571
It's kind of a dry run for death.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.215
OK...

15:11.223 --> 15:12.904
Well, see you.

15:12.926 --> 15:14.126
See ya'.

15:14.794 --> 15:16.844
- Hey dad?
- Yeah?

15:17.316 --> 15:20.615
Even though Mom stopped loving you
and Kandi stopped loving you,

15:20.630 --> 15:22.397
you don't have to worry about me.

15:22.566 --> 15:23.642
Thanks pal.

15:23.644 --> 15:26.321
You're my dad,
I pretty much got to love you.

15:30.996 --> 15:31.954
So?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.667
Is he still crawled up
like a cocktail shrimp?

15:35.498 --> 15:36.698
Yep.

15:37.048 --> 15:39.347
This was a real fun week-end.

15:40.004 --> 15:42.304
Wait in the car Jake,
and I'll be right there.

15:43.574 --> 15:46.414
Ok, I am running out
of patience with this guy,

15:46.425 --> 15:50.385
I've had relationships end and
I don't go crawling into bed over it.

15:50.391 --> 15:53.047
Yeah yeah yeah,
you know what I mean.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.586
It may not be just the relationship...

15:55.640 --> 15:56.985
What are you talking about?

15:56.990 --> 16:01.517
Charlie, I've studied psychology for eight
years and been a patient for twenty.

16:02.959 --> 16:06.741
Your brother is exhibiting all the classic
signs of clinical depression.

16:06.752 --> 16:08.765
What are you saying,
you think he might try to hurt himself?

16:08.769 --> 16:11.895
The important question is:
do we stop him?

16:13.444 --> 16:16.383
Oh, like I'm the only one
here thinking that.

16:19.454 --> 16:20.345
Alright,

16:20.350 --> 16:23.572
I didn't want to have to do this, but
desperate times call for desperate measures.

16:23.574 --> 16:24.488
What are you gonna do?

16:24.505 --> 16:26.629
Something I hoped I'd never have to.

16:26.643 --> 16:27.726
You don't mean...

16:27.732 --> 16:29.326
I'm afraid so.

16:30.441 --> 16:31.675
Hello?

16:31.679 --> 16:33.315
Mom?

16:37.087 --> 16:40.641
Oh God...
What plague have you set up on me now?

16:40.663 --> 16:42.079
Alan...

16:42.085 --> 16:44.116
It's Mommy.

16:45.735 --> 16:47.018
Good one.

16:49.364 --> 16:53.234
Ooooh, my poor darling.

16:53.658 --> 16:55.634
How are you holding up?

16:55.639 --> 16:57.114
How do you think?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.352
I blew another marriage,

16:59.407 --> 17:02.807
wasted all my money,
I'm a complete and utter failure.

17:02.811 --> 17:06.828
Oh sweetie, you just can't see
the big picture, can you?

17:06.829 --> 17:08.020
What big picture?

17:08.032 --> 17:12.973
Every foolish choice you've made,
every wasted opportunity,

17:12.983 --> 17:16.759
every helpless misstep
in your sad misbegotten life...

17:16.773 --> 17:18.828
I know, I know...

17:18.843 --> 17:21.751
It's an opportunity to learn and grow...

17:21.762 --> 17:26.748
Well, perhaps, but more importantly,
it's a reflection on me.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.624
Always good to see you Mom...

17:29.638 --> 17:32.522
- I'm not finished.
- Of course not.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.798
There is a silver lining
in this dark cloud...

17:35.805 --> 17:38.767
I can't wait to hear about it.

17:40.103 --> 17:42.105
You're all alone,

17:42.313 --> 17:43.763
you're penniless,

17:43.772 --> 17:45.813
and you have no prospects...

17:45.820 --> 17:48.789
Are we at the silver lining part yet?

17:49.394 --> 17:53.239
Yes, short of contracting
a flesh-eating disease,

17:53.251 --> 17:56.789
things couldn't possibly get any worse.

17:57.217 --> 17:59.191
You've hit rock bottom!

17:59.201 --> 18:01.833
You have nowhere to go but up!

18:03.323 --> 18:04.620
You know what?

18:05.232 --> 18:06.600
You're right.

18:07.605 --> 18:11.920
You're self obsessed, insensitive and
soul-sucking, but you're right.

18:13.815 --> 18:16.399
I am staring into the abyss...

18:16.703 --> 18:18.427
and I'm still here.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.141
I've had my heart shattered,

18:21.159 --> 18:25.004
and then shattered again,
and I'm still here.

18:25.465 --> 18:29.151
I've taken every piece of crap
that life could throw at me,

18:29.155 --> 18:30.498
and I'm still here.

18:30.507 --> 18:34.404
Well, we don't have to turn this
into "an evening with Liza Minelli".

18:36.578 --> 18:41.100
Now... Get washed,
get dressed, get on with your life.

18:41.111 --> 18:42.202
OK...

18:42.214 --> 18:45.420
And remember, no matter what,

18:45.429 --> 18:47.212
I'll always love you.

18:48.542 --> 18:49.339
Thanks...

18:49.351 --> 18:51.880
Don't thank me sweetheart,
I'm your mother...

18:51.881 --> 18:53.419
I have to love you.

19:01.234 --> 19:02.402
Hey.

19:03.431 --> 19:04.461
Hey.

19:04.462 --> 19:06.416
Thanks for taking
Jake back to Judith's.

19:06.424 --> 19:07.858
No problem.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.644
Sorry I had to send Mom in there.

19:09.644 --> 19:13.716
No no, you did the right thing,
I needed a good slap in the face...

19:13.717 --> 19:17.204
Although with Mom, it's more like
a nailgun to the testicles...

19:20.158 --> 19:21.820
That was my thinking.

19:21.821 --> 19:23.183
Well... um...

19:23.379 --> 19:24.707
I'm really grateful.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.064
Don't mention it.

19:27.944 --> 19:29.243
So...

19:29.512 --> 19:31.078
Look at us, uh?

19:31.091 --> 19:33.297
Just like old times.

19:33.724 --> 19:34.924
Yep.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.473
The Harper brothers,
together again!

19:41.305 --> 19:44.781
The chicks will come and go, but you
and I will always be there for each other.

19:45.842 --> 19:47.183
Sure.

19:48.573 --> 19:49.926
Forever.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.539
Not literally until the end of time,
but you know,

19:56.553 --> 19:58.108
until one of us dies.

19:59.490 --> 20:02.863
It will probably be you 'cause
you don't take very good care of yourself.

20:04.595 --> 20:05.844
Gotcha'.

20:08.532 --> 20:10.191
Fist me.

20:14.717 --> 20:16.777
You want me to fist you?

20:16.794 --> 20:20.246
You know, like the bros in the hood.

20:21.346 --> 20:25.313
We're the bros, and this is our hood.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.489
Pow! Right on.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.360
Tell you what,
I will grab us a couple of brewskies,

20:37.372 --> 20:40.428
so that Team Harper
can kick back and chill...

20:40.906 --> 20:42.093
Terrific.

20:42.111 --> 20:46.851
Well, actually I'm more in a mood
for Chardonnay, but I'll get you a beer.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.623
OK...

20:48.626 --> 20:54.053
Hum, maybe I'll make a nice little plate
of cheese and crackers, nothing fancy.

20:54.619 --> 20:55.881
Good.

20:56.442 --> 20:58.852
Uh, I don't suppose you have any brie?

21:00.670 --> 21:02.285
I don't know.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.253
Not important, you relax.
I got you covered.

21:06.268 --> 21:07.819
Pow!
