00:02.620 --> 00:03.669
Previously on
"Marvel's Inhumans"...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.619
Do you remember what it was like
before we were king and queen?

00:05.620 --> 00:08.039
Sooner or later,
the humans are going to find us.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.289
This is the live feed
that was going down to Earth.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.789
If the humans see this...

00:11.790 --> 00:13.829
Nobody is gonna know that
that's a hoof.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.459
We've been hiding here too long.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.249
Let's go to our rightful home!

00:17.250 --> 00:18.500
You're speaking of treason.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.330
Maximus... he's dangerous.

00:23.670 --> 00:24.789
Triton is dead.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.379
We're in the middle of a coup.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.119
You must escape now.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.249
No, we all have to escape.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.879
Are you going to use your voice?

00:31.880 --> 00:33.379
Kill your only brother?

00:33.380 --> 00:34.619
Stop him!

00:50.790 --> 00:54.829
Where am I?

00:57.330 --> 00:59.619
This is your fault. I
will never forgive you.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.619
Black Bolt, where are you?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.619
Lockjaw...

01:27.620 --> 01:30.790
where did you leave me?

01:32.750 --> 01:34.499
It's a coup.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.539
Lockjaw, take Karnak
to where Gorgon is.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.079
Stupid dog.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.919
This is a rescue mission.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.959
Triton!

02:12.380 --> 02:15.380
You should've known
this day was coming.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.210
What the...

02:35.120 --> 02:36.280
What the hell was that, man?!

02:37.250 --> 02:38.500
Hey.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.579
Hey, hey, hey!

02:41.580 --> 02:43.420
What's going on here, man?

02:46.460 --> 02:48.040
Give it back.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.459
Hey. Hey.

02:52.460 --> 02:53.959
- The cops are here.
- Where are you going?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.579
Hey, where you going?

02:56.580 --> 02:58.959
You can't just run off!
What the hell, man?

02:58.960 --> 03:00.209
It was him, bro.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.669
The guy in black.

03:15.830 --> 03:18.249
Where did you send them?

03:18.250 --> 03:19.919
You really think
I'm going to tell you?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.249
Lockjaw!

03:24.250 --> 03:26.119
Take me to Black Bolt
and the others.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.879
No!

03:27.880 --> 03:29.709
Lockjaw, wake up!

03:29.710 --> 03:30.999
Lockjaw! Lockjaw!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.959
Take her to her apartment.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.379
Lockjaw, wake up!
Don't let her out.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.249
Wake up. Lockjaw, wake up.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.539
Don't hurt him!

03:43.500 --> 03:46.329
He stays here.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.830
Contact Black Bolt.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.249
Black Bolt?

04:15.250 --> 04:17.249
It's me.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.579
I'm here on Earth... somewhere.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.709
I'm safe.

04:22.710 --> 04:26.619
I'm in a... a crater, I think.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.419
Are you here?

04:28.420 --> 04:31.999
Can you hear me? Please.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.420
Just let me know
that you're okay.

04:42.620 --> 04:45.749
Thank...

04:45.750 --> 04:48.540
Thank you.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.709
I hear cars... traffic.

04:57.710 --> 05:00.329
You're here.

05:00.330 --> 05:05.290
I have to go,
but I will find you.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.999
Where does this bus go?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.620
Back to the city.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.520
Okay, everyone,
let's get back on board.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.750
I need to find my king.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.419
Word is spreading
that the Royal Family has fled,

06:25.420 --> 06:26.999
but most don't know
what to make of it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.119
Put Royal Guards
on every corner.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.999
A quiet show of force.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.379
Make them a little nervous,
and just when they need it most,

06:34.380 --> 06:37.119
I will step out
and provide a calming hand.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.379
What are you doing?

06:44.380 --> 06:46.539
You can't sit there.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.289
This is the last thing I wanted.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.329
But our people need a leader.

06:51.330 --> 06:53.169
You're not the king.

06:53.170 --> 06:54.789
Where is Lockjaw?

06:54.790 --> 06:57.919
Where is my family?

06:57.920 --> 07:01.539
I understand
what you're feeling.

07:09.580 --> 07:12.169
I know that right now,

07:12.170 --> 07:14.789
you see me as the bad guy.

07:14.790 --> 07:16.999
But I hope
that you can take a step back

07:17.000 --> 07:22.499
from everything
and... understand.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.249
Understand what?

07:25.250 --> 07:28.579
That the way you view the world,

07:28.580 --> 07:32.209
perched on the seat
of royal privileged,

07:32.210 --> 07:36.379
your head crammed with lies
from the Genetic Council,

07:36.380 --> 07:39.379
is not the way
things really are.

07:39.380 --> 07:42.789
Do you even remember
what your life was like

07:42.790 --> 07:45.579
before your sister
married Black Bolt?

07:47.420 --> 07:49.999
What would your parents
think of you now,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.749
protecting the family
they so detested?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.379
I understand.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.419
You've put all that behind you.

07:58.420 --> 08:02.249
But I simply ask you
to open your mind.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.709
You're not
a child anymore, Crystal.

08:05.710 --> 08:06.999
I know that.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.959
Then you should know
that things are changing,

08:09.960 --> 08:11.999
and they're not going back.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.829
You can spend
the rest of your life

08:14.830 --> 08:17.209
imprisoned in your room...

08:17.210 --> 08:20.669
or you can join hands with me
and move forward.

08:20.670 --> 08:23.289
What do you mean, "join hands"?

08:23.290 --> 08:26.169
Speak to the people of Attilan.

08:26.170 --> 08:29.169
Honor me as your new king.

08:32.210 --> 08:35.789
Never. You make me sick.

08:35.789 --> 08:38.708
You're just a human.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.289
I'm so sorry you feel that way.

08:48.920 --> 08:54.669
You're young, pretty, smart...

08:54.670 --> 08:57.749
a princess, even.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.959
But none of that
will keep terrible tragedy

09:04.960 --> 09:07.499
from falling upon you.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.419
Triton!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.379
You should've sent me.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.419
We got you.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.880
So, you're one of them?

10:23.920 --> 10:26.540
No.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.959
You're one of them.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.379
I'm Makani.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.209
Gorgon.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.379
Those legs are clearly
not made for swimming.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.329
You must be one of those
Inhumans I've read about.

10:42.330 --> 10:47.579
I was looking for Triton,
my cousin.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.289
Fell off the cliff.

10:49.290 --> 10:52.999
He was being chased
by humans with guns.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.539
You all are a violent people.

10:55.540 --> 10:57.999
He was sent here by my king.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.709
But you think Triton's dead.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.079
So what are you gonna do now?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.749
I have no choice.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.379
I have to wait here

11:07.380 --> 11:09.499
until they send someone
to bring me back.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.580
Back where?

11:13.250 --> 11:15.579
The Moon.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.040
Cool.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.379
Wanted to see
if you were still holding on

11:28.380 --> 11:30.209
to your hoof scenario.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.120
Until something changes my mind.

11:33.710 --> 11:36.209
You see what's coming out
of Goldstone?

11:36.210 --> 11:39.499
These four energy glitches on
the same location on the Moon?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.119
Yes, we all saw that.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.999
Yeah, well, the data suggests
there's an energy pulse

11:44.000 --> 11:45.999
moving 1,250 miles per hour

11:46.000 --> 11:47.879
in the opposite direction
of the Moon's motion.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.619
Now, using the speed
and the direction,

11:49.620 --> 11:52.619
I was able to triangulate the
course to a location on Earth...

11:52.620 --> 11:53.749
The island of Oahu.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.119
Louise, you should be trying
to figure out

11:56.120 --> 11:57.669
what happened to the rover.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.079
Yeah, well, I happen to think
they might be related.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.619
Come on, now.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.039
We were able to pick up
four energy bursts above Hawaii

12:04.040 --> 12:05.499
at almost exactly the same time.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.329
I happen to think
that something...

12:09.330 --> 12:11.999
Well, four somethings...

12:12.000 --> 12:15.789
From the Moon left the Moon
and landed in Hawaii.

12:15.790 --> 12:17.919
And those glitches
on the Moon...

12:17.920 --> 12:20.169
They happened
at exactly the same place

12:20.170 --> 12:21.379
as our rover died.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.209
So, what you're suggesting

12:23.210 --> 12:25.419
is that our creature
with the hooves

12:25.420 --> 12:28.579
and three of his,
his buddies smashed our rover,

12:28.580 --> 12:32.420
and now they've come
to visit us on Earth?

12:34.080 --> 12:37.079
I don't know if they're buddies.

12:37.080 --> 12:41.209
Louise, you were hired here

12:41.210 --> 12:42.749
because everyone thinks
you're brilliant.

12:42.750 --> 12:46.749
A little nutty, maybe,
but brilliant.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.209
But now it's looking like
the nutty part

12:49.210 --> 12:51.539
is pushing brilliant
right out of the way.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.749
Okay.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.709
You know I don't...
much like doing this,

12:56.710 --> 12:58.419
but I'm gonna have to

12:58.420 --> 13:00.500
relieve you of your duties
on this mission.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.249
Well, that's disappointing.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.790
I'm sorry.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.119
But, you know, actually...

13:10.120 --> 13:11.789
I think I should...

13:11.790 --> 13:14.170
I should probably
take some time off.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.419
That's probably a good idea.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.170
Yeah.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.250
Aah.

13:35.710 --> 13:39.040
Aah.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.789
King.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.579
Need to find my king.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.499
East.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.250
West.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.079
North, south.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.169
You think that little gun
matches what I can do?

15:59.170 --> 16:01.879
If not, I've got
nine more guards outside

16:01.880 --> 16:04.499
who'd love to take
target practice on a princess.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.380
Hoping you're not hungry.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.119
You know, the sooner you
accept Maximus as your king,

16:17.120 --> 16:19.039
the happier you're gonna be.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.539
He's a traitor.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.169
My family's going to come back.

16:23.170 --> 16:28.000
And what if they don't?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.879
Contact Medusa.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.419
- Hello?
- Medusa!

16:56.420 --> 16:58.119
You're safe.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.120
Yes.

16:59.121 --> 17:02.119
Where are you? Are you on Earth?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.499
No, Maximus has me locked up
in my apartment.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.618
Are you okay?

17:05.619 --> 17:08.459
I'm fine,
but he's taken over Attilan.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.709
They've got Lockjaw somewhere.
And the others?

17:10.710 --> 17:12.579
Black Bolt and Karnak
made it out.

17:12.579 --> 17:13.749
They're not with you?

17:13.750 --> 17:15.919
No. No, I...

17:15.920 --> 17:19.169
I spoke to Black Bolt.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.669
I don't know where he is,

17:20.670 --> 17:22.209
but I will find him
and the others,

17:22.210 --> 17:24.039
and we will come back for you.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.539
Don't worry about me.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.709
I stole Auran's comlink. What?

17:27.710 --> 17:28.829
It fell off.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.379
No, Auran's too smart for that.

17:33.790 --> 17:35.619
It was a setup.
They wanted you to call me.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.999
They're tracking this call.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.379
They're using this to find me.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.539
No.

17:39.540 --> 17:41.209
I'm sorry.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.119
It's okay.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.959
I have to go. Be careful.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.499
Remember what I taught you.

18:07.210 --> 18:11.419
Look, I can't just sit here
waiting for Lockjaw to get me.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.329
You said you were a fighter.

18:14.330 --> 18:15.829
I am a fighter.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.460
Then bring the fight to you.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.459
Gorgon. You're alive.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.749
And so are you.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.169
Where's my family?

18:38.170 --> 18:39.579
That's the question

18:39.580 --> 18:41.829
at the forefront
of my mind, cousin.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.619
I suppose this means
they're not with you.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.539
So, they're here on Earth.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.749
What the hell have you done?

18:48.750 --> 18:51.329
I have brought freedom
to our people.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.169
I'm sure if we had more time,

18:53.170 --> 18:55.499
I could make you see my side.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.119
Yeah, well, you're gonna see
the bottom of my hoof

18:58.120 --> 18:59.419
before that happens.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.919
I wish we could come
to some sort of agreement.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.289
We will.

19:05.290 --> 19:09.039
Because I'm leaving
my comlink on.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.999
Come again?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.749
I'm leaving my comlink on.

19:14.750 --> 19:19.579
I mean, should you wish
to come and find me...

19:19.580 --> 19:20.710
traitor.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.709
You should leave.

19:31.710 --> 19:34.829
Why would we leave our beach?

19:34.830 --> 19:36.539
Because when they come,
they're gonna come right here,

19:36.540 --> 19:37.669
and when they do,

19:37.670 --> 19:39.209
there's gonna be
some serious trouble.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.540
Who doesn't like
a little trouble?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.539
What's happened to me?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.789
You've located Medusa?

21:34.790 --> 21:36.039
Yes.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.419
What would you like me to do?

21:41.040 --> 21:45.039
Gather up whatever you need,
whoever you need.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.579
Then transport to Earth

21:47.580 --> 21:50.169
and take care
of the Royal Family.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.619
"Take care of"?

21:52.620 --> 21:55.379
Bring back...

21:55.380 --> 21:57.709
or kill.

21:57.710 --> 22:01.579
Black Bolt definitely kill.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.579
Gorgon, too.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.169
All I need is myself.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.709
It's best to be discreet.

22:06.710 --> 22:09.710
Then go see Eldrac
for transport.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.619
Eldrac!

22:27.620 --> 22:29.920
It's Auran.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.459
I know who you are.

22:33.460 --> 22:36.039
I need you to transport me here.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.669
No.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.169
I say yes.

22:40.170 --> 22:42.209
I said no.

22:42.210 --> 22:45.039
It's painful.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.919
I don't care if it's painful.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.459
If you don't,
I will kill your entire family

22:49.460 --> 22:52.580
and bring all their pieces
to you in a garbage bag.

23:00.830 --> 23:05.079
If you do anything
that harms me...

23:05.080 --> 23:08.749
the guards will make you pay.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.169
Excuse me. Yeah. Excuse me.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.709
All right.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.379
Hey, slow down.

23:39.380 --> 23:42.040
Wait till we're stopped.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.749
Can I help you?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.999
You're not from here, are you?

25:12.380 --> 25:13.999
You don't speak English.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.539
Um, why don't I
show you something? Come.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.789
What about that?

25:36.540 --> 25:39.079
Security!

25:46.170 --> 25:47.249
We have a shoplifter.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.119
He just assaulted
a security guard.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.170
Freeze!

26:02.790 --> 26:04.919
Down on your knees.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.040
Down on your knees.

26:10.960 --> 26:14.209
Hands behind your head.

26:14.210 --> 26:16.539
Hands behind your head.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.119
Behind your head.

26:27.040 --> 26:27.960
Aah!

26:27.961 --> 26:29.170
Aah!

27:10.830 --> 27:14.119
Get on the ground!
Freeze! Freeze!

27:14.120 --> 27:16.919
Down! Down!

27:16.920 --> 27:18.540
Down!

27:19.750 --> 27:21.539
You're surrounded!
Get on the ground!

27:21.540 --> 27:22.579
Take him down!

27:29.000 --> 27:31.619
Don't resist! Don't resist!

27:31.620 --> 27:33.959
Down on the ground!

27:38.040 --> 27:39.920
Taser, Taser, Taser!

28:14.250 --> 28:16.499
Freak.

28:24.540 --> 28:28.209
Bronaja, please, join me.

28:28.210 --> 28:31.619
I wanted to continue
our conversation.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.789
Of course.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.789
Tell me...

28:34.790 --> 28:38.249
have you had
any more... visions?

28:38.250 --> 28:41.579
No. Nothing.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.420
Perhaps if...

28:55.000 --> 28:58.959
That is very interesting.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.880
What did you see?

29:03.420 --> 29:05.459
They want to kill you. Who?

29:05.460 --> 29:08.669
They were wearing silver robes.

29:08.670 --> 29:11.209
The Genetic Council. Yes.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.119
They were talking...

29:13.120 --> 29:16.039
planning...

29:16.040 --> 29:18.919
your death.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.380
Thank you, Bronaja.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.499
You are most helpful.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.379
I'll see you soon.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.669
There was a strange
and violent confrontation

29:43.670 --> 29:45.499
with police
in downtown Honolulu today,

29:45.500 --> 29:46.999
in which the suspect managed

29:47.000 --> 29:49.379
to flip
an officer's police cruiser.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.999
Eyewitnesses say
he appeared out of nowhere.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.380
The suspect is now
in police custody.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.039
Council members.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.249
Ils this everyone?

30:05.250 --> 30:08.749
Generally,
when a Council meeting is held,

30:08.750 --> 30:11.789
the Royal Family is notified.

30:11.790 --> 30:13.749
In the absence of Kitang,

30:13.750 --> 30:17.499
it seems rules have been
falling by the wayside.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.829
I would very much like
to keep you all on my side,

30:20.830 --> 30:22.209
but honestly...

30:22.210 --> 30:24.039
that's up to you.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.539
I do miss Kitang
and his guidance.

30:27.540 --> 30:31.329
Do you know
what his last words were?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.579
They were a sort of...

30:33.580 --> 30:38.669
gurgling, guttural sound.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.209
Not exactly words.

30:42.210 --> 30:45.999
But I do hope that you keep them
close to your hearts

30:46.000 --> 30:47.499
as you move forward.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.039
Me again.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.539
What?

31:19.540 --> 31:22.119
I simply want to talk.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.169
I haven't changed my mind.

31:24.170 --> 31:25.960
I'll never side with you.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.579
I think you should reconsider.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.209
Acts of violence seem to be
springing up everywhere.

31:50.210 --> 31:53.209
I'd hate
for your beloved Lockjaw

31:53.210 --> 31:58.169
to be involved
in some sort of...

31:58.170 --> 32:00.039
accident.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.209
You wouldn't.

32:02.210 --> 32:05.459
I'd certainly prefer not to.

32:05.460 --> 32:09.169
Because that is not
who I want to be...

32:09.170 --> 32:12.169
Cruel and vicious.

32:12.170 --> 32:16.749
You still have a choice.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.419
I would've thought that you,
out of anyone,

32:18.420 --> 32:20.579
would understand my position
and know that it's right.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.039
But why me?

32:22.040 --> 32:24.789
Your parents, of course.

32:24.790 --> 32:29.959
They gave their lives trying
to do exactly what I'm doing...

32:29.960 --> 32:31.579
Overthrow the old system

32:31.580 --> 32:35.079
and move forward
toward something better.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.709
Do you even remember that?

32:37.710 --> 32:39.289
Of course I do.

32:39.290 --> 32:43.119
They were killed
by my own parents...

32:43.120 --> 32:45.120
Black Bolt's parents.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.619
Are you truly willing
to risk your life

32:49.620 --> 32:53.079
supporting something that
they knew was so deeply wrong?

32:55.080 --> 32:59.169
I'll let you think on this.

32:59.170 --> 33:04.619
But not too long.

33:26.620 --> 33:29.709
This the guy?

33:29.710 --> 33:32.039
This is him.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.539
Not a word? Nothing.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.000
You can't be in here right now.
Hey, I said...

33:59.210 --> 34:02.499
No one touches me.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.748
Traitor!

34:50.960 --> 34:53.619
Not much without your hair?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.919
No match on his fingerprints.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.709
No ID on him.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.919
Clothes he was wearing before he
stole this was pretty bizarre.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.419
Everybody's ID'ing him

35:22.420 --> 35:23.829
as the same guy
that caused the traffic tieup.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.709
They're saying
he appeared out of nowhere.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.169
Hey!

35:28.170 --> 35:31.039
Are you not speaking?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.579
Or you one of those smartasses

35:32.580 --> 35:34.620
that's waiting for your lawyers
to come and get you?

35:35.500 --> 35:38.579
And if he was out of those cuffs
and tried again,

35:38.580 --> 35:39.750
his luck would run out.

35:43.170 --> 35:45.499
Don't move! Hands in the air!

35:47.170 --> 35:49.209
I prefer
to bring you back alive.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.959
You tell me if that's possible.

35:58.210 --> 36:00.499
I am the queen of Attilan.

36:00.500 --> 36:04.000
No one tells me what to do.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.289
Maximus will find you.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.619
We take your picture,
we take you to lockup.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.169
Put those away.

36:43.170 --> 36:45.459
He's cooperating.

36:48.330 --> 36:51.210
Photographer!

37:00.750 --> 37:02.880
Contact Black Bolt.

37:09.290 --> 37:12.539
Black Bolt, I'm near the city.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.289
Soon, we will be together,

37:14.290 --> 37:16.919
and when we are,
we will return to Attilan.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.039
We will find Maximus,

37:18.040 --> 37:19.579
and we will
tie a rope around his neck

37:19.580 --> 37:22.119
and throw him from
the highest wall in the city.

37:22.120 --> 37:27.710
We are not defeated, not ever.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.209
Bronaja, Loyolis.

38:11.210 --> 38:13.999
I have come to see
how Bronaja's adjusting.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.999
He's doing horribly, as am I.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.459
I understand.

38:19.460 --> 38:22.749
I do. But trust me.

38:22.750 --> 38:26.539
The days of Black Bolt's
rigid meritocracy

38:26.540 --> 38:28.789
are coming to an end.

38:28.790 --> 38:31.419
And you, my friend...

38:31.420 --> 38:36.119
you will play a big part
in our new society.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.999
All of you will.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.499
Me?

38:40.500 --> 38:43.619
How?

38:43.620 --> 38:48.789
You, Bronaja, are special.

38:48.790 --> 38:52.999
You can see the future.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.919
I can build it.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.789
We can build it...

38:57.790 --> 39:01.959
All of us together,
all of us equal.

39:01.960 --> 39:07.169
A great Inhuman once said that
difficulties strengthen the mind

39:07.170 --> 39:09.669
as well as labor does the body.

39:11.540 --> 39:12.879
I guess that means

39:12.880 --> 39:14.760
you're the smartest
and the strongest of us all.

39:17.460 --> 39:22.879
You, like me...
Like everyone in Attilan...

39:22.880 --> 39:26.379
We are defined by change.

39:26.380 --> 39:30.039
Who we are today
is not who we are born.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.789
We transform...

39:31.790 --> 39:37.289
an evolution that usually only
happens once in our lifetimes.

39:37.290 --> 39:40.169
But change is happening today.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.119
Now...

39:43.120 --> 39:47.080
Black Bolt is gone.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.249
Yes.

39:50.250 --> 39:55.079
Our king has deserted us at
the hour of our greatest need.

39:55.080 --> 39:59.289
I ask you to accept me
in his place,

39:59.290 --> 40:02.669
not to keep things as they are,
but to move forward.

40:02.670 --> 40:06.619
We are the change that we seek.

40:06.620 --> 40:10.080
We will have a new beginning.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.579
When the current crisis is past,

40:14.580 --> 40:19.079
we will leave Attilan
and go to Earth.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.039
Life will be
what you make of it.

40:23.040 --> 40:27.829
The doors of opportunity
will be wide open.

40:27.830 --> 40:32.039
We will create our hope.

40:32.040 --> 40:35.289
We will create our destiny.

40:35.290 --> 40:41.000
We will create our will.

40:42.290 --> 40:46.499
We will not let anyone
or anything stop us,

40:46.500 --> 40:50.920
because nothing can keep us
from being free!

42:09.960 --> 42:11.249
Contact Maximus.

42:11.250 --> 42:13.919
This is Auran.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.539
I need backup.
