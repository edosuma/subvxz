01:32.600 --> 01:34.160
Where are you?

01:42.360 --> 01:44.000
Conservative MPs
are in uproar as Boris Johnson

01:44.000 --> 01:45.120
Conservative MPs
are in uproar as Boris Johnson

01:45.160 --> 01:48.120
rips the party apart by withdrawing
from the leadership contest

01:48.160 --> 01:51.520
after being betrayed
by fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.000
The speculation about when
a new PM will trigger Article 50

01:52.000 --> 01:55.120
The speculation about when
a new PM will trigger Article 50

01:55.160 --> 01:58.440
to initiate the UK's departure
from the EU...

01:58.480 --> 02:00.000
Here.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.640
Here.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.560
Stupid thing won't bloody work.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.960
There's nothing wrong
with your tie, baby.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
You're just nervous.
Why did I become a banker?

02:08.000 --> 02:08.200
You're just nervous.
Why did I become a banker?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.160
Well, if you want to walk away,
that's OK.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.120
We have more than we need.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.000
You know, I always wanted
to start a donkey sanctuary.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.440
You know, I always wanted
to start a donkey sanctuary.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.000
Finance, donkeys...

02:21.960 --> 02:24.000
..whatever you do,
I'll be right there with you.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.760
..whatever you do,
I'll be right there with you.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.800
Massimo's gonna
see this as a betrayal.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.440
If that's what he sees,
he's wrong. OK?

02:36.480 --> 02:39.400
This is going to be terrible.
Look, he's a banker.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.000
They don't come with hearts of gold.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.560
They don't come with hearts of gold.

02:42.880 --> 02:48.000
Except you. You're the exception
that proves the rule, donkey-boy.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.160
Except you. You're the exception
that proves the rule, donkey-boy.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.600
You know...

02:52.640 --> 02:55.800
I get that it's discreet here,
but...

02:56.680 --> 02:58.800
..nobody would see us
at your place either.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.760
Or yours.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.360
Or mine. Hm.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.000
We'd better get to work.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.760
We'd better get to work.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.080
Whatever you say, boss.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.080
You go first.
Mh-hm.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.320
Go! OK.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Was that work? The call?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.080
Was that work? The call?

04:03.040 --> 04:05.760
I'm having a jacket taken in.
Yeah.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.000
I don't want you knowing
all my secrets.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.000
Go ahead.
Right.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.120
Go ahead.
Right.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.560
Good morning.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.000
How did you find me?
I didn't find you.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.640
How did you find me?
I didn't find you.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.600
I found your phone. I'm a busy guy.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.760
I reviewed every deal your bank
made involving Chinese investors

04:53.800 --> 04:56.000
over the last 12 months. And?
Maybe the surveillance programme

04:56.000 --> 04:57.320
over the last 12 months. And?
Maybe the surveillance programme

04:57.360 --> 04:59.960
had nothing to do with
why Kalim was killed.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.000
What changed your mind?
Contact tracing, Ellams Automotive.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.880
What changed your mind?
Contact tracing, Ellams Automotive.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.800
These are the only deals with
software the Chinese could exploit.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.200
There's no pattern.
Then we're missing something.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.000
No, I reviewed every deal
you sent me, twice.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.200
No, I reviewed every deal
you sent me, twice.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.240
We're working on a deal right now -
a social media app, Flamestar.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.000
Only six months old, but millions
of customers all over the world.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.240
Only six months old, but millions
of customers all over the world.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.280
I know the Flamestar app,
everybody uses that in Hong Kong.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.000
It's how my kid brother
stays in touch with his friends.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.080
It's how my kid brother
stays in touch with his friends.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.840
Lots of young people use it
to hide their identity,

05:31.880 --> 05:33.960
share information,
organise demonstrations.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It might explain
the Chinese interest in acquiring
it.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.280
It might explain
the Chinese interest in acquiring
it.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.520
Overnight, they've massively
expanded their surveillance
programme. OK.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.760
Where are you going?
To work.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.000
That woman who left the hotel
just before you, who is she?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.680
That woman who left the hotel
just before you, who is she?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.320
None of your business.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.920
Good morning.
Good morning.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.240
I need to see that by the end
of the day. OK, thank you.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.000
Fancy seeing you here.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.920
Fancy seeing you here.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.240
You're joking.
Yes.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.000
Take a look at these companies.
What are they? Social media.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.400
Take a look at these companies.
What are they? Social media.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.080
Based on the numbers, tell me which
you would target as a priority.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.000
Oh! I have a meeting this morning,
I would like for you to sit in.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.400
Oh! I have a meeting this morning,
I would like for you to sit in.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.520
'Sit in'?
Sit and watch.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.200
What for?
So you can learn.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.920
I need to speak
with Damian Curtis, Agnes.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.000
Try calling him. I have, a thousand
times. He's not picking up.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.360
Try calling him. I have, a thousand
times. He's not picking up.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.960
Can we meet?
Text me when and where.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.000
Hey, did you speak to Zhi
this morning?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.520
Hey, did you speak to Zhi
this morning?

07:05.560 --> 07:07.440
I just got here.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.360
Easy tiger, I'm asking because
we're going to suggest to the board.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.000
I don't want to know.
About what?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.040
I don't want to know.
About what?

07:13.080 --> 07:15.760
About any companies
you may be evaluating.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.520
You said we're below our targets -
I know what I said.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.000
It's OK.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.160
It's OK.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.000
Huh. You do know you'll find out
at two o'clock, anyway.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.000
You know, just...
something I have to...you know...

07:28.000 --> 07:32.320
You know, just...
something I have to...you know...

07:32.360 --> 07:35.240
I've been meaning to tell you.
Shit.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.000
Massimo. Have you been read
into the Flamestar deal?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.400
Massimo. Have you been read
into the Flamestar deal?

07:45.440 --> 07:47.920
Flamestar? No, not yet.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.240
Good, neither have I.
I don't want to be restricted.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.000
I'm worried it might be a target.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.560
I'm worried it might be a target.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.000
A target for who?

07:56.040 --> 07:59.680
China...
for the surveillance programme.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.000
What, Kalim's story? We don't even
know if that's a real thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.880
What, Kalim's story? We don't even
know if that's a real thing.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.000
Look, I think you may
be a little paranoid.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.840
Look, I think you may
be a little paranoid.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.760
Come on, you don't...

08:13.800 --> 08:16.000
you don't believe Liwei had anything
to do with what happened to Kalim?

08:16.000 --> 08:16.840
you don't believe Liwei had anything
to do with what happened to Kalim?

08:16.880 --> 08:21.040
Not directly, but maybe
there's something bigger behind it.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.000
Massimo...listen to yourself.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.600
Massimo...listen to yourself.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.280
Look.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.000
If we do anything to interfere with
Flamestar, that's insider trading.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.480
If we do anything to interfere with
Flamestar, that's insider trading.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.280
After today's meeting,
yes, not before.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.160
Zhi hasn't said anything to us yet.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.000
We have just under four hours
to find another investor to block...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.480
We have just under four hours
to find another investor to block...

08:42.520 --> 08:45.880
No-one is going to back you in
a play to undermine your own bank.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.880
It's too risky.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.000
Look, I know you feel responsible
for what happened to Kalim...

08:48.000 --> 08:51.800
Look, I know you feel responsible
for what happened to Kalim...

08:51.840 --> 08:53.600
Will you help or not?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.480
Well...
I was waiting here to tell you...

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
..Joe Talmadge has offered me
Head of Trading at Durings Bank.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.760
..Joe Talmadge has offered me
Head of Trading at Durings Bank.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.840
There's nowhere for me to go here.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.600
Look, you're my friend,
and I love you, but...

09:17.640 --> 09:20.000
I can't help you with this,
all right?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.120
I can't help you with this,
all right?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.360
I'm going to hand in my resignation,
and...

09:25.560 --> 09:27.880
..I'll be out of here
in a few weeks.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.240
Was there anything else?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.760
Look, Massimo...
Get out of my office.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.120
Get out of my office, please.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.080
Carolina. Dominic.
Thank you for coming.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.960
Nadya Wojcik,
she's working for me now.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.240
Do you mind if she sits in?
Not at all.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.960
I'm guessing this
has to do with Liwei Cheng.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I was told you used my offer
to get a better deal with him.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.800
I was told you used my offer
to get a better deal with him.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.960
'All's fair in love and war.'
I think you taught me that.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.760
Give me a chance to win you back.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.000
As much as I like the sound of that,
I don't think you can.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.200
As much as I like the sound of that,
I don't think you can.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.520
I can make you more money
than he can.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.000
So you say.
But there are two problems.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.560
So you say.
But there are two problems.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.640
One's called Rebecca Farmer.

10:49.040 --> 10:53.160
You don't approve of her. I don't
trust her or how she makes her
money.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.880
Once you cross the Bosphorus,
it's a different planet.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.000
I can take care of you and Rebecca.
You said there were two problems.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.840
I can take care of you and Rebecca.
You said there were two problems.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.000
Massimo Ruggero is crucial to
securing the acquisitions you need.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.160
Massimo Ruggero is crucial to
securing the acquisitions you need.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.080
You said he'd be leaving NYL
to join you. I see no sign of it.

11:08.120 --> 11:11.160
He will be...in short order.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.640
All right, then.
I'll put Liwei on hold.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.000
You know I'd rather be in bed
with you anyway.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.480
You know I'd rather be in bed
with you anyway.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.440
But my patience is limited.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.920
You have more than
enough patience for this.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.520
Pleasure to meet you, Nadya.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.480
What's your take on that?

11:40.640 --> 11:43.000
She betrayed you
by going to Liwei Cheng.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.000
It was a smart move. I would have
been disappointed if she hadn't.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.600
It was a smart move. I would have
been disappointed if she hadn't.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.760
But you can't trust her.
I suppose not. Can I trust you?

11:54.640 --> 11:57.360
Legal's looking
into your sponsorship license.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.880
Your name isn't Nadya, is it?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.000
Irena.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.720
Irena.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.360
I don't like that name.
So you made up your own?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.000
My babcia chose it for me.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.160
My babcia chose it for me.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.520
My grandmother raised me. She wanted
Nadya to be my confirmation name.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.160
'She wanted it to be'?

12:15.040 --> 12:16.000
She died.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.480
She died.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.400
It never happened.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.000
Do you still want me
to check those companies or not?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.400
Do you still want me
to check those companies or not?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.440
Sure, go ahead.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.000
Flamestar. Thanks. And what about
the Brexit polling report?

12:48.000 --> 12:48.960
Flamestar. Thanks. And what about
the Brexit polling report?

12:49.920 --> 12:53.360
Damian Curtis has dropped off
the face of the Earth, but...

12:53.400 --> 12:55.840
I'm working on it.
All right.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.160
I know I'm not
getting senior analyst,

13:02.200 --> 13:04.000
but...may I ask who is?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.560
but...may I ask who is?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.240
I'll let you know when I've decided.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.440
Hey.
Hey.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.200
I need to tell you something.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.800
I got a new job.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.440
Durings, Head of Trading.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.000
Oh.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.160
Oh.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.880
I thought you'd be happy for me.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.040
No...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I am, I'm sorry. That's great.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.720
I am, I'm sorry. That's great.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.200
Is it a secret?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.000
No, I just told Massimo.
How did it go?

13:52.000 --> 13:52.800
No, I just told Massimo.
How did it go?

13:52.840 --> 13:54.840
About as badly as it could.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.680
He'll come around, he's just
under a lot of pressure right now.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.240
You deserve this.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.920
You really do.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.000
Thank you.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.960
Thank you.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.040
Hey, your turn will come.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.000
You think?
Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.320
You think?
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.240
Gotta go, see you in a bit.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.360
And um...congratulations.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
Mm.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.400
..majorities think that
personal data is less secure now,

14:45.440 --> 14:48.000
and that data collection poses
more risks than benefits.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.440
and that data collection poses
more risks than benefits.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.360
Many believe it is not possible
to go through daily life

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
without being tracked.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.000
Thank you.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.840
Thank you.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.000
Li Bolin.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.720
Li Bolin.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.240
My brother warned me about you.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.720
I made him millions.
You should be happy to see me.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.920
Inside, I'm happy.

16:02.120 --> 16:06.800
I know your family history.
They lost everything when they fled
China.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.000
So, my guess...

16:08.000 --> 16:08.840
So, my guess...

16:08.880 --> 16:12.240
is you're not exactly
a supporter of the Communist Party.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.560
I'm not really a party guy at all.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.000
Nine times out of ten,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.760
Nine times out of ten,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.160
I'll take karaoke over tanks
and re-education camps.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.200
Why?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.000
I have a way for you
to make a few more million...

16:24.000 --> 16:25.520
I have a way for you
to make a few more million...

16:25.560 --> 16:27.560
while screwing over the Communists.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.000
Now I'm happy on the outside.
Good.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.240
Now I'm happy on the outside.
Good.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.000
Tell me more.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.480
Eleanor. Hi.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.000
Thanks for coming. I didn't want
to say too much on the phone.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.360
Thanks for coming. I didn't want
to say too much on the phone.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.320
Frankly, you never know
who's listening.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.880
Is there something
you don't want them to hear? No.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.000
I just like to be cautious.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.760
I just like to be cautious.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.960
I need to speak to Damian.
He's been avoiding me.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.040
You and me both. He hasn't
been in since the Brexit mess.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.000
He's a nice enough guy,
and I'm trying to cover for him,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.720
He's a nice enough guy,
and I'm trying to cover for him,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.640
but he's in a lot of hot water,

16:59.680 --> 17:02.560
and I have no idea
how his polling data went so wrong.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.000
There must be some way of reaching
him. He didn't have any friends...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.920
There must be some way of reaching
him. He didn't have any friends...

17:05.960 --> 17:09.640
other than Kalim. He's not answering
my calls or e-mails.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.000
Our investment meeting
is this afternoon.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.360
Our investment meeting
is this afternoon.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.240
You have 45 minutes
to tell me whether you're in.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.760
Two o'clock, I'll tell you.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.000
I just need to make
a couple of calls, due diligence.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.120
I just need to make
a couple of calls, due diligence.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.360
Massimo.
What?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.880
Once that meeting starts
at two o'clock,

17:43.920 --> 17:44.000
once you are read in
on the Flamestar deal,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.840
once you are read in
on the Flamestar deal,

17:45.880 --> 17:48.840
it's too late for you to do
anything without breaking the law.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.520
I know that, thank you.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.120
Yes?
Massimo, I need to see you.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.000
I'll be at the investment meeting.
It's a private matter.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.760
I'll be at the investment meeting.
It's a private matter.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.120
OK, I'll be right there.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.000
I met with an investor,
Carolina Elsher. Oh.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.080
I met with an investor,
Carolina Elsher. Oh.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.240
Do you know her?
Only by reputation.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.720
Hm. She told me Dominic Morgan
is starting a SPAC.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.000
And you're going to lead it.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.640
And you're going to lead it.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.080
He made me an offer.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.560
You didn't think to mention it.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.000
I've no intention of accepting,
so...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.720
I've no intention of accepting,
so...

18:57.760 --> 19:00.680
You know how important
the Chinamerica policy has been

19:00.720 --> 19:03.560
for this bank,
the profit it's generated.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.120
Of course I do.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.600
Where are you going with this?

19:11.640 --> 19:12.000
I'm going to be frank with you.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.920
I'm going to be frank with you.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.280
After the debacle with Brexit,

19:17.320 --> 19:20.000
Stonehouse isn't sure
you're the man for the job any more.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.040
Stonehouse isn't sure
you're the man for the job any more.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.080
I see.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.520
You need me on your side
now more than ever.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.000
And I will be, just so long
as I know you're on mine.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.720
And I will be, just so long
as I know you're on mine.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I am, thank you.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.000
Anything else?
I'll walk to the meeting with you.

19:44.000 --> 19:44.760
Anything else?
I'll walk to the meeting with you.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.560
So, how long have you known Zhi?

19:54.600 --> 19:58.080
Since she was a trader
in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.000
Why?
Just curious.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.200
Why?
Just curious.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.160
Go ahead, don't mind me.
It's nothing.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.600
You know, I forgot the other phone.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.120
I'll be right back, one minute.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.160
I thought you'd be sitting
by the phone. Busy day.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.560
I'm about to press the button
on the Flamestar call options

20:30.600 --> 20:32.000
at $70 a share.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.280
at $70 a share.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.920
So, go ahead.
I want to be very clear.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.520
If I lose money on this deal,
I will not hesitate to expose you

20:39.560 --> 20:40.000
as the one who instructed me to make
it. Very least, you'd lose your job.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
as the one who instructed me to make
it. Very least, you'd lose your job.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.360
Push the button.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.720
I need one final piece
of reassurance.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.400
Just answer this question -
why are you doing this?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.000
It's not every day the CEO of NYL
screws over his own bank.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.120
It's not every day the CEO of NYL
screws over his own bank.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.200
I let a friend down, I owe him.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.440
It's done.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.280
OK, thank you.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.000
What's that about?
Dry cleaning's ready.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.920
What's that about?
Dry cleaning's ready.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.920
Ready to go?
Yeah.

21:20.240 --> 21:25.120
One of the companies we're currently
looking to invest in is Flamestar.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.000
I'm talking to the authorities
about a possible merger. Hm.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.520
I'm talking to the authorities
about a possible merger. Hm.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.520
Just give me a minute.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.280
I ran the numbers on those social
media companies like you asked.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.000
Mh-hm.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.320
Mh-hm.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.080
The one with
the most potential is this one.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.360
Flamestar? Before we proceed...
can I ask whether anyone

21:48.400 --> 21:51.320
has an interest they should declare?
Any conflicts?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.840
No?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.760
You are surprised?
Pleased.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.560
You were testing me.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.000
So tell me, Nadya, why Flamestar?

22:08.000 --> 22:08.840
So tell me, Nadya, why Flamestar?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.760
Flamestar is
a great prospect...

22:12.400 --> 22:16.000
..combining as it does
an easy-to-use video-music interface

22:16.000 --> 22:16.640
..combining as it does
an easy-to-use video-music interface

22:16.680 --> 22:20.120
with private chat rooms.
The app itself is free.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.000
Its value lies in the massive amount
of data it collects on its users,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.280
Its value lies in the massive amount
of data it collects on its users,

22:25.320 --> 22:28.560
tracking all kinds of information
from the other applications

22:28.600 --> 22:31.200
they carry on their phones,
such as where they go,

22:31.240 --> 22:32.000
what they buy,
what kind of articles they read.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.720
what they buy,
what kind of articles they read.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.680
If those tens of thousands of data
points are fed into algorithms...

22:37.720 --> 22:40.000
..they can then select
which ads you see...

22:40.000 --> 22:40.360
..they can then select
which ads you see...

22:40.400 --> 22:43.360
..decide what news and information
is presented to you...

22:43.400 --> 22:46.520
..creating the world you see
and shaping the decisions you make.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.000
In Seoul, math simply beat a man...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.240
In Seoul, math simply beat a man...

22:49.280 --> 22:52.000
..with this technology,
they can control him.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.000
Our investor intends to make
a tender offer at $100 per share.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.200
Our investor intends to make
a tender offer at $100 per share.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.600
Any questions?
Massimo?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.240
No, not from me.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.480
You did really well with this.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.520
Nadya? I'm hosting drinks tonight
with some investors.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.200
You should come.

23:20.240 --> 23:24.880
I...I don't want to.
00pm. Maybe ditch the sweatshirt.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.480
'Maybe'?
Definitely.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.160
Massimo?
Yeah? Do you have a second?

23:34.200 --> 23:36.000
Tell me. I have to put
the Brexit polling report to bed,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.520
Tell me. I have to put
the Brexit polling report to bed,

23:37.560 --> 23:39.880
but Damian Curtis
hasn't been returning my calls.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.200
I spoke with his colleague
Agnes Sharma.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.000
Nobody has seen Damian
since Kalim was killed.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.520
Nobody has seen Damian
since Kalim was killed.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.280
You were right to tell me, thank
you.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.640
Don't be mad at Oliver, OK?

23:50.680 --> 23:52.000
We have too much history.
And with Kalim...

23:52.000 --> 23:53.200
We have too much history.
And with Kalim...

23:54.920 --> 23:57.880
..with Kalim gone,
we need each other.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.800
OK.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.840
Good evening, Ms Elsher.
Nadya.

24:10.880 --> 24:15.040
Where did Dominic find you?
A go match in Korea.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.000
Of course.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.080
Of course.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.800
Better than the sweatshirt.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.040
Carolina, you remember
Rebecca Farmer. Ms Elsher.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.840
This is how you're fixing it?

24:37.160 --> 24:40.000
I think you owe me a drink.
Champagne?

24:40.000 --> 24:40.400
I think you owe me a drink.
Champagne?

24:40.440 --> 24:43.360
I think I want
something stronger than that. Mm.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.000
He's never going
to forgive me for this.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.120
Give him time, Oliver. Massimo is
Adrian's godfather. He'll come
round.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.400
Yeah, I suppose.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.800
I've got Joe Talmadge from Durings
trying to get through. Take it.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.120
Joe.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.000
Oliver, sorry
for calling you like this,

25:04.000 --> 25:04.720
Oliver, sorry
for calling you like this,

25:04.760 --> 25:08.000
but I really need to see you.
Can you make it over here right now?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.040
Yeah. Is there a problem?

25:11.040 --> 25:12.000
Let's speak face to face.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.040
Let's speak face to face.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.280
Hey.

25:28.040 --> 25:31.520
You OK? You seemed
a little distracted at the meeting.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.280
I'm fine.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.000
You sure?
Of course, yeah.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.960
You sure?
Of course, yeah.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.360
Do you want to talk?

25:45.760 --> 25:47.320
Well...

25:48.360 --> 25:52.000
..whatever is bothering you, you can
talk to me. You know that, right?

25:52.000 --> 25:52.120
..whatever is bothering you, you can
talk to me. You know that, right?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.560
Can I?

25:55.680 --> 25:57.480
What do you mean?

26:00.200 --> 26:01.920
I've been thinking.

26:02.880 --> 26:07.400
I'm not sure a workplace
relationship is good for either of
us right now.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.520
'Right now'.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.000
I see.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.320
Maybe we should cool it for a while.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.400
If you say so.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.760
This way, Mr Harris.
Thank you. Hey.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.360
Oh, come on, Joe, how bad can it be?

26:53.400 --> 26:55.680
I haven't even started working here.

26:57.280 --> 27:00.560
I'm so sorry, Oliver...
but you won't be.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.000
What? The bank has had
to retract its job offer.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.960
What? The bank has had
to retract its job offer.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.280
Why would the bank do that?

27:08.320 --> 27:11.240
It's come to our attention
that you were paid to take exams

27:11.280 --> 27:12.000
for other students while studying
at the School of Economics.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.720
for other students while studying
at the School of Economics.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.600
'Come to your attention'?

27:19.480 --> 27:20.000
How?
It doesn't matter.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.360
How?
It doesn't matter.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.760
It matters to me.
I can't say.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.000
But you're not denying it.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.760
But you're not denying it.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.600
That kind of unethical behaviour
is simply unacceptable.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.000
Mr Talmadge,
you don't have to do this.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.280
Mr Talmadge,
you don't have to do this.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.360
I'm the best candidate for this job,
you said so yourself. You were.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.000
But not any more.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.560
But not any more.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.080
Rebecca does
a huge amount for charity.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.000
What's not to like about using
some spare tax-deductible cash

28:00.000 --> 28:02.080
What's not to like about using
some spare tax-deductible cash

28:02.120 --> 28:04.560
to promote the welfare of others?

28:05.560 --> 28:08.000
You made your money in Russian oil?
You don't like Russians?

28:08.000 --> 28:08.760
You made your money in Russian oil?
You don't like Russians?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.160
Oh, I love the Russian people.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.760
It's the politics of their oligarchs
that make me uncomfortable.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.000
You think I'm too far to the right.
Aren't you?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.600
You think I'm too far to the right.
Aren't you?

28:17.640 --> 28:21.320
Rebecca doesn't ascribe
to binary terms like left or right.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.480
Hm.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.160
They don't have
a real meaning today.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.440
Why would I let someone put me
in a red or blue box

28:29.480 --> 28:32.000
when I can choose what gender I am?
We live in a pick and mix world.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.080
when I can choose what gender I am?
We live in a pick and mix world.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.520
'Pick and mix'.
Sounds like a nut assortment.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.600
I believe in climate change,

28:39.640 --> 28:40.000
but I also supported Brexit...

28:40.000 --> 28:41.720
but I also supported Brexit...

28:41.760 --> 28:44.200
as a way of increasing trade,
not reducing it.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.000
Above all, I believe that the
current system of global capitalism

28:48.000 --> 28:48.400
Above all, I believe that the
current system of global capitalism

28:48.440 --> 28:51.400
is inimical to human flourishing.
You believe in a lot of things.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.280
And you believe in?
Profit.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.000
At last you agree on something.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.520
At last you agree on something.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.320
I knew it would happen
sooner or later.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.560
To our shared belief in profit.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.200
Join us. I don't drink alcohol.
OK, have some fruit juice.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.480
It's about the act, not the alcohol.

29:11.960 --> 29:12.000
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers. To profit.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.920
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers. To profit.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.000
Was that work? I don't want
you knowing all my secrets.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.200
Was that work? I don't want
you knowing all my secrets.

29:22.240 --> 29:26.160
You know that Ebola tracking
software app I mentioned?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.000
I really think it has potential,
real potential.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.520
I really think it has potential,
real potential.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.360
Kalim is desperate to impress you
with the contact tracing deal -

29:31.400 --> 29:34.040
maybe he wasn't the only one
who understood its significance.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.000
You need me on your side
now more than ever.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.520
You need me on your side
now more than ever.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.120
And I will be, just so long
as I know you're on mine.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.160
I lost the job.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.000
But then you knew that already. Hm?

30:08.000 --> 30:08.080
But then you knew that already. Hm?

30:09.040 --> 30:12.920
What are you talking about? They
found about the exams thing at uni.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.000
Only two people knew.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.200
Only two people knew.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.560
It was you and Philip Wade.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.640
And he didn't even know
I was up for the job,

30:21.680 --> 30:24.000
let alone have a reason to tank it.
Listen to me.

30:24.000 --> 30:24.280
let alone have a reason to tank it.
Listen to me.

30:25.880 --> 30:28.160
I'm the godfather of your son.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.200
I was disappointed...

30:31.200 --> 30:32.000
..and hurt.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.040
..and hurt.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.640
But I would never betray you.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.000
I would never do that to you.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.040
I would never do that to you.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.840
OK.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.640
Our Flamestar bid has been blocked.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.920
By? An unknown investor
picked up call options.

31:27.960 --> 31:28.000
What percentage?
Thirty.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.760
What percentage?
Thirty.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.480
When? Just before two o'clock
yesterday afternoon.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.160
I didn't say anything.
I know.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.000
What's that about?
Dry cleaning's ready.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.040
What's that about?
Dry cleaning's ready.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.640
What do we do? With Marchesi's 30%,
that leaves us with 40%.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.000
It's not enough.
Buy it anyway.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.840
It's not enough.
Buy it anyway.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.200
Now.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.680
I have no idea how this happened,
but I intend to find out.

31:56.720 --> 32:00.000
I think it was Massimo,
but I'm not sure why he'd do it.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.240
I think it was Massimo,
but I'm not sure why he'd do it.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.800
Perhaps he's already working
for Dominic Morgan.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.560
If anyone can find out, it's you.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.080
You're in a relationship with him.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.480
How could you know that?

32:16.120 --> 32:19.480
You've been tracking his movements?
He works for this bank.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.000
He ended our relationship
last night.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.240
He ended our relationship
last night.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.000
Another offer just came in for
Flamestar - $20 higher than ours.

32:32.000 --> 32:32.640
Another offer just came in for
Flamestar - $20 higher than ours.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.000
Who made the offer?
Dominic Morgan.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.000
It appears that Morgan's newly
formed Special Purpose Acquisition
Company

32:40.000 --> 32:42.960
It appears that Morgan's newly
formed Special Purpose Acquisition
Company

32:43.000 --> 32:45.560
has put in an aggressive offer
for Flamestar.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.520
However,
even if the offer is accepted,

32:47.560 --> 32:48.000
it won't give Morgan enough
to control the company.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.960
it won't give Morgan enough
to control the company.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.720
How did you know?

32:53.760 --> 32:55.920
You didn't think
I was gonna let another domino

32:55.960 --> 32:56.000
fall into Chinese hands?
It hasn't.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.560
fall into Chinese hands?
It hasn't.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.640
I assume you know
who picked up the call options.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.040
They're not going to sell it
to me or the Chinese?

33:07.080 --> 33:10.600
Your position at NYL is untenable.
I think you know that.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.000
You're not getting Flamestar.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.840
You're not getting Flamestar.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.040
But I am, and you're gonna help me.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.280
You just don't know it yet.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.000
Have you heard?

33:27.480 --> 33:28.000
We have a leak. Someone inside
the bank tanked the Flamestar deal.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.720
We have a leak. Someone inside
the bank tanked the Flamestar deal.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.640
It was you, wasn't it?

33:35.440 --> 33:36.000
Why?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.120
Why?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.320
Why?

33:41.560 --> 33:44.000
Because I don't think
it was some random hate crime.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.120
Because I don't think
it was some random hate crime.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.680
I think Kalim found out
about a mass surveillance programme

33:49.720 --> 33:51.440
by the Chinese government.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.320
Maybe Liwei is involved.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.280
You can prove that?
Not that they killed Kalim.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.000
But the surveillance programme
is real.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.320
But the surveillance programme
is real.

34:01.360 --> 34:05.200
They acquired that content
tracing app to take users' data.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.000
And then Ellams.
And now Flamestar. Yes.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.200
And then Ellams.
And now Flamestar. Yes.

34:10.160 --> 34:15.360
Short-term, data on dissidents in
Hong Kong, access to their chat
room.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.000
Long term, who knows?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.120
Long term, who knows?

34:18.160 --> 34:19.720
Oliver knows all this?

34:21.480 --> 34:24.000
I can't count on him, not any more.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.520
I can't count on him, not any more.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.040
Can I count on you?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.560
What do you want me to do?

34:33.760 --> 34:36.720
First, an anonymous investor
picks up 30% of my company's stock,

34:36.760 --> 34:39.280
then I find myself facing
a possible hostile takeover

34:39.320 --> 34:40.000
from Dominic Morgan. I could
lose control of my own company.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.960
from Dominic Morgan. I could
lose control of my own company.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.560
You could. Where the hell is Zhi?
I need her advice.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.000
She'll only tell you New York London
will raise the Chinese bid tomorrow,

34:48.000 --> 34:48.880
She'll only tell you New York London
will raise the Chinese bid tomorrow,

34:48.920 --> 34:50.760
well above the offer made by MAI.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.440
That's good news.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.000
But if I were you,
I would keep my options open.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.160
But if I were you,
I would keep my options open.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.000
NYL's interests lie with
their Chinese investor, not you.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.440
NYL's interests lie with
their Chinese investor, not you.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.040
You work for NYL.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.000
I just don't want to see you
make a mistake, that's all.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.920
I just don't want to see you
make a mistake, that's all.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.000
I've identified the investor
who purchased the call options.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.800
I've identified the investor
who purchased the call options.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.720
It's Li Bolin.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.000
His brother Li Acheng
has history with Massimo.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.560
His brother Li Acheng
has history with Massimo.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.160
Massimo betrayed the bank.
And you.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.280
He knew it was your deal.

35:45.160 --> 35:49.240
We cannot afford to lose Flamestar,
Zhi. Massimo must be stopped.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.800
You're the only person
who can do it.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.920
But Li Bolin
already has the call options.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.280
I'm not talking about
a financial move.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.440
Hi.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.800
Contact details for Damian Curtis.

36:25.240 --> 36:29.480
I'll find out what I can.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.000
How far are you willing to go?
Why?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
How far are you willing to go?
Why?

36:34.120 --> 36:37.040
After the Hong Kong
freedom protests in 2012,

36:37.080 --> 36:39.160
I was detained
by the Ministry of Public Security.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.840
Blindfolded, made to stand
in stress positions, beaten.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.000
They wanted me to give the names
of all my activist friends.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.040
I refused to give them.
I'm sorry.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.040
My sister and I left our family,
my little brother -

36:54.080 --> 36:56.000
everything I cared about -
so that I could keep fighting.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.840
everything I cared about -
so that I could keep fighting.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.720
That's who I am now.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.400
I get that Kalim was your friend,

37:02.440 --> 37:04.000
and you want to stop the people who
killed him. Find them if you can.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.600
and you want to stop the people who
killed him. Find them if you can.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.720
That's right.
And then?

37:08.920 --> 37:10.960
How far are you willing to go?

37:39.440 --> 37:42.520
Stonehouse wants to see you
in the boardroom.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.080
You're all looking rather grim.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.360
There are rumours
on the trading floor.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.000
What rumours? We have
our suspicions about Flamestar.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.160
What rumours? We have
our suspicions about Flamestar.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.520
We can't prove them, not yet.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.760
OK.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.000
So what is this about?

38:24.880 --> 38:27.880
Wu Zhi has confirmed to HR
that you entered into

38:27.920 --> 38:30.760
an inappropriate sexual relationship
with her.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.000
Sexual relations with a subordinate
are expressly forbidden

38:40.000 --> 38:40.440
Sexual relations with a subordinate
are expressly forbidden

38:40.480 --> 38:43.200
in your contract
as a Chief Executive Officer. You...

38:43.240 --> 38:45.840
You're aware of that, aren't you?

38:52.840 --> 38:54.920
Yes. I am.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.160
Do you admit to having
a relationship?

39:09.160 --> 39:11.200
Yes.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.000
In that case, your employment at NYL
is terminated with immediate effect.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.720
In that case, your employment at NYL
is terminated with immediate effect.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.960
You're OK to go down there?

41:29.920 --> 41:32.360
I can't believe
you asked this of me.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.520
I took no pleasure in it.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.000
Didn't you? Why else ask me
to be there when you told him?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.680
Didn't you? Why else ask me
to be there when you told him?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.640
I never wanted to hurt you, Zhi,

41:40.680 --> 41:44.000
but he had to know that whatever
there was between you, it is over.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.400
but he had to know that whatever
there was between you, it is over.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.520
That he has no hold over you now.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.240
Right, and you do.

41:49.280 --> 41:52.000
You blame me, and yet it was you
who engaged in this relationship,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.320
You blame me, and yet it was you
who engaged in this relationship,

41:53.360 --> 41:55.360
which you knew to be inappropriate.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.000
This relationship belonged to me.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.200
This relationship belonged to me.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.760
It was private.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.000
You used me. Are your needs
greater than those of your family?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.440
You used me. Are your needs
greater than those of your family?

42:13.960 --> 42:16.000
Of China and all her people?

42:16.000 --> 42:16.240
Of China and all her people?

43:09.120 --> 43:11.120
You don't seem surprised to see me.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.400
I'm not.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.000
So...

43:20.000 --> 43:21.520
So...

43:23.520 --> 43:25.720
..you're working for Dominic Morgan.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.000
I don't work for anyone.
Hm.

43:28.000 --> 43:28.880
I don't work for anyone.
Hm.

43:30.520 --> 43:34.000
With, maybe. How did you know?

43:34.040 --> 43:36.000
Leaking anti-union videos to Ellams
isn't Dominic's style.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.640
Leaking anti-union videos to Ellams
isn't Dominic's style.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.440
And the video with the Iranians...
come on.

43:43.680 --> 43:44.000
Of course.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.520
Of course.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.600
You've changed.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.000
It's Dominic who's changed, not me.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.120
It's Dominic who's changed, not me.

43:54.520 --> 43:58.120
He sees now, as I always have,
that China must be defeated

43:58.160 --> 44:00.000
if globalism is to be stopped.
That's it.

44:00.000 --> 44:00.680
if globalism is to be stopped.
That's it.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.000
You think...

44:08.000 --> 44:09.240
You think...

44:09.280 --> 44:11.800
he got Sofia killed, don't you?

44:11.840 --> 44:15.720
Or at least knew about it.
Then that would be Dominic's style.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.760
You're going to tell me
it was the 13th floor, I know.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.720
No doubt in my mind.
Sofia threatened their power.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.000
She...She was...

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
She...She was...

44:32.280 --> 44:35.200
And Dominic was already exiled
from the bank when she...

44:37.680 --> 44:39.800
He knows what's going on at NYL.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.000
Do you mean the deals you're making

44:40.000 --> 44:43.160
Do you mean the deals you're making

44:43.200 --> 44:46.000
for Ellams Automotive and Flamestar?

44:46.960 --> 44:48.000
Kalim and that contact tracing app.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.480
Kalim and that contact tracing app.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.720
Clever as you are, I should think

44:51.760 --> 44:54.000
you would have
figured it out by now.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.000
I had spyware installed
in the NYL servers for Dominic.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.880
I had spyware installed
in the NYL servers for Dominic.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.880
It's been transmitting data
for nearly six weeks,

45:02.920 --> 45:04.000
giving us access
to all your internal correspondence.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.680
giving us access
to all your internal correspondence.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.000
Look, Massimo, there are really
only two sides to this war now -

45:12.000 --> 45:13.440
Look, Massimo, there are really
only two sides to this war now -

45:13.480 --> 45:15.600
China, Cheng Liwei,

45:15.640 --> 45:18.280
and the bank from which
you've just been so...

45:18.320 --> 45:20.000
ignominiously evicted.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.520
ignominiously evicted.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.560
Or...

45:23.480 --> 45:27.040
..us. Which side are you on?

45:40.560 --> 45:42.440
Nadya.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.800
You're going home.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.680
And at a decent hour too.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.000
There's a Catholic church
a half-mile from here.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.080
There's a Catholic church
a half-mile from here.

45:53.120 --> 45:55.320
I'm taking confirmation classes.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.040
Good for you.
Your Bafta would be proud.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.000
Babcia, yes.

46:00.000 --> 46:00.040
Babcia, yes.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.960
She was the only one
who cared about me.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.000
When you asked me about my name...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.840
When you asked me about my name...

46:12.400 --> 46:14.120
..it reminded me.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.000
I'm glad to have been of service,
Nadya Wojcik.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.680
I'm glad to have been of service,
Nadya Wojcik.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.320
Good night.
Good night.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.960
I thought you were leaving.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.360
Massimo.

47:03.960 --> 47:04.000
Come here.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.680
Come here.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.800
The whole DNC server complex
was hacked -

47:35.840 --> 47:36.000
someone had pretty full access
to everything on that system.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.320
someone had pretty full access
to everything on that system.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.480
The Democratic National Committee
was on Hillary Clinton's side.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.000
I've been talking to cybersecurity
experts who are convinced

47:44.000 --> 47:45.920
I've been talking to cybersecurity
experts who are convinced

47:45.960 --> 47:48.560
that Russian intelligence
was behind this cyberattack.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.400
She put us all at risk!

47:50.440 --> 47:52.000
Hillary cheats!
Thank you, WikiLeaks!

47:52.000 --> 47:53.560
Hillary cheats!
Thank you, WikiLeaks!
