00:30.033 --> 00:31.900
Happy anniversary, Mr. and Mrs. Coleman.

00:31.935 --> 00:33.176
Thank you, Enrique.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.166
Here you go.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.755
Honey, uh,

00:37.760 --> 00:39.446
you mind driving? I've got
some phone calls to run.

00:39.476 --> 00:40.765
Oh, sure.

00:48.711 --> 00:49.968
See you next time.

00:50.003 --> 00:51.225
Have a nice day.

01:00.258 --> 01:01.232
Hey! Who are you?

01:01.267 --> 01:02.207
Shut up and drive!

01:02.420 --> 01:03.682
Come on.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.183
Someone call the police!

01:36.943 --> 01:38.317
Massive injuries, Alexx.

01:38.649 --> 01:39.989
Was she thrown from the car?

01:40.375 --> 01:41.675
Down onto the rocks.

01:44.361 --> 01:46.432
Paramedics brought her
up here to work on her.

01:47.539 --> 01:49.509
I see six major bone breaks.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.995
I guess the carjacker didn't
give her time to buckle up.

01:53.789 --> 01:55.241
Is that a gunshot wound to the head?

01:56.276 --> 01:57.078
Yeah.

01:57.104 --> 01:58.424
No wonder they crashed.

01:58.962 --> 02:00.272
How 'bout the husband?

02:00.577 --> 02:02.811
Paramedics said he's
busted up but lucid.

02:02.943 --> 02:04.212
And Homicide?

02:04.550 --> 02:05.919
At the restaurant.

02:08.407 --> 02:09.667
Excuse me.

02:12.965 --> 02:14.183
Mr. Coleman.

02:15.757 --> 02:17.077
Please don't say it.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.372
Mr. Coleman, I'm sorry.

02:19.621 --> 02:20.921
Oh, God.

02:21.134 --> 02:22.201
Oh, God.

02:22.211 --> 02:23.937
It was our anniversary. I, uh...

02:24.577 --> 02:26.049
I took off work to celebrate.

02:26.475 --> 02:27.745
I understand.

02:28.445 --> 02:29.826
Is there anything you can tell me

02:29.866 --> 02:32.121
about the man who did this
while it's still fresh?

02:32.699 --> 02:34.019
He, uh...

02:34.228 --> 02:36.594
he got in the car as
we... as we drove away.

02:36.705 --> 02:38.015
He asked for my wallet.

02:38.523 --> 02:39.904
Somewhere along the way, he, uh,

02:40.163 --> 02:42.589
he hit me with his gun.
I blacked out- I, um...

02:44.519 --> 02:45.818
I can't remember anything.

02:45.853 --> 02:46.844
Okay.

02:46.993 --> 02:48.252
Listen, um...

02:48.283 --> 02:49.613
I don't want you to worry about it,

02:49.755 --> 02:50.769
all right,

02:50.770 --> 02:52.070
Mr. Coleman,

02:52.248 --> 02:53.558
because I...

02:54.319 --> 02:55.619
I'll be your memory.

03:54.163 --> 03:55.627
I'm not a religious man,

03:55.662 --> 03:57.092
but when I was laying there,

03:57.102 --> 03:59.783
I heard God's voice saying
my name over and over...

04:00.382 --> 04:01.702
Mr. Coleman,

04:02.042 --> 04:04.378
I'd like to take you back to
the carjacking, if I could.

04:04.469 --> 04:06.215
We need to make a sketch of this man.

04:07.825 --> 04:09.145
He wore a ski mask.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.851
Anything else?

04:11.196 --> 04:12.526
He might've been Hispanic.

04:13.298 --> 04:14.354
Okay.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.852
What exactly happened?

04:17.079 --> 04:18.410
He said to drive...

04:18.613 --> 04:19.903
to Biscayne.

04:24.579 --> 04:26.843
When we reached the bridge,
he told us to pull over.

04:27.778 --> 04:29.138
Kay swerved the car sharp,

04:29.139 --> 04:30.632
and he hit me with his gun.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.986
Like I said,I can't remember anything.

04:37.329 --> 04:38.639
Thank you.

04:43.873 --> 04:45.173
Hey, Ryan,

04:45.762 --> 04:48.391
didn't the report say the carjacker
demanded Mr. Coleman's wallet?

04:48.970 --> 04:49.905
Yeah. Why?

04:49.940 --> 04:51.290
It never left the car.

04:52.568 --> 04:53.846
It's full of cash.

05:00.116 --> 05:01.920
Kay Coleman's purse is here, too.

05:02.459 --> 05:03.794
One 20.

05:05.228 --> 05:06.549
A lighter.

05:06.802 --> 05:08.137
V ial.

05:08.605 --> 05:09.911
Some kind of liquid.

05:09.983 --> 05:10.828
Is it a drug?

05:10.863 --> 05:12.354
I can't tell. Label's torn off.

05:13.064 --> 05:14.442
I'll have the vial processed.

05:14.598 --> 05:17.225
There should be some
spatter from Kay's head shot.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.987
The window and the dash
are coming up clean.

05:42.263 --> 05:43.570
Where's that tar from?

05:43.605 --> 05:44.919
Oil spills.

05:45.146 --> 05:46.453
The tide brings it in.

05:46.964 --> 05:48.285
Tide didn't bring that in.

05:49.045 --> 05:50.195
What's that?

05:50.230 --> 05:51.345
A blood pool.

05:51.899 --> 05:53.618
There's spatter next to it.

05:53.731 --> 05:55.805
High-velocity. It's
consistent with a gunshot.

06:03.198 --> 06:06.204
So Mrs. Coleman was
shot outside the car.

06:06.394 --> 06:07.200
After the wreck.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.301
You know, on Patrol, we
used to call that "hinky".

06:09.895 --> 06:11.652
You know what, Ryan? CSI still does.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.737
Guy forces a couple on a ride,

06:17.055 --> 06:20.021
crashes the car, kills the
woman and leaves the money.

06:20.024 --> 06:20.991
That does not sound

06:20.992 --> 06:23.034
like any carjacking that
I have ever heard of.

06:23.037 --> 06:24.119
Join the club.

06:24.982 --> 06:25.735
Thank you.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.140
Eric?

06:28.328 --> 06:29.076
Yeah?

06:29.441 --> 06:31.472
We're gonna do the sodium
rhodizonate test on you.

06:31.507 --> 06:32.369
What's that mean?

06:32.376 --> 06:34.797
It means we want to
process your hand for GSR.

06:35.899 --> 06:37.186
Okay, I guess.

06:39.471 --> 06:40.211
What's GSR?

06:40.214 --> 06:41.675
It's gunshot residue.

06:49.188 --> 06:49.910
It's negative.

06:49.945 --> 06:50.603
Okay.

06:50.609 --> 06:53.715
I'd like to stay in touch with
you as the investigation proceeds.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.392
Are you telling me not to leave town?

06:55.630 --> 06:57.283
I guess I am, yeah.

06:59.613 --> 07:01.297
After the hospital...

07:02.298 --> 07:03.284
I'll be at the company:

07:03.291 --> 07:04.506
Coleman Shutters.

07:06.823 --> 07:08.761
Coleman Shutters. Is
that a family business?

07:08.864 --> 07:10.827
With my brothers.
Storm shutters

07:11.229 --> 07:13.048
got a better chance of
reaching me there than at home.

07:13.049 --> 07:14.855
Okay. I'd appreciate that.

07:16.016 --> 07:16.866
Gentlemen.

07:20.669 --> 07:21.495
What's up?

07:23.263 --> 07:24.740
Man's wife is killed,

07:25.666 --> 07:27.455
and he goes back to work the same day?

07:32.429 --> 07:33.905
I'm Alexx Woods,

07:34.235 --> 07:35.582
Medical Examiner.

07:36.242 --> 07:39.796
And this is Chris Tate. 17.

07:40.341 --> 07:42.924
Senior at Saint Simon High School.

07:43.224 --> 07:44.424
Great soccer player.

07:45.036 --> 07:46.120
Even better student.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.669
Got an early acceptance to Harvard.

07:49.445 --> 07:50.977
Would've started next fall.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.618
Oh, God, I can't look.

07:52.892 --> 07:53.884
I wish I hadn't.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.103
He was in a crosswalk in broad daylight,

07:57.529 --> 08:00.058
but the driver was too drunk to see him.

08:00.867 --> 08:01.860
He never had a chance.

08:11.046 --> 08:12.137
Did they catch who did it?

08:12.580 --> 08:14.815
Driver came to a stop 50 yards away.

08:14.822 --> 08:16.663
Smashed into a newspaper stand.

08:17.276 --> 08:18.082
Walked away.

08:19.342 --> 08:20.754
Drunk drivers bend.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.258
They don't break.

08:23.093 --> 08:25.517
I host these visits from alcohol

08:25.518 --> 08:27.596
treatment programs for a reason.

08:28.923 --> 08:30.208
Remember Chris.

08:30.627 --> 08:33.167
And thank you for taking the first step.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.740
Dr. Woods, you have a minute?

08:44.919 --> 08:45.803
What's your name?

08:46.080 --> 08:46.939
Derek Roddison.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.599
Derek Roddison, come on down.

08:52.252 --> 08:54.372
I noticed a lot of
bodies in the corridor.

08:55.127 --> 08:57.589
I'm thinking maybe you're short
on haulers, could use some help.

08:57.613 --> 08:58.744
You asking for a job?

08:59.054 --> 09:01.755
I was a corpsman in the
Navy. I know the territory.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.146
County Rescue's a better bet.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.169
Maybe, but the thing is, uh...

09:06.743 --> 09:08.207
seeing this boy, Chris, it...

09:09.241 --> 09:10.025
it affected me.

09:10.813 --> 09:12.838
Haul bodies, stay sober, huh?

09:14.392 --> 09:15.131
Sorry, Derek.

09:15.498 --> 09:17.878
The ME's office can't
be your personal rehab.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.603
Oh, I understand that, but, uh,

09:20.135 --> 09:22.005
it wouldn't hurt, and
you do need a hauler.

09:27.349 --> 09:31.352
One week, till we get caught
up. Then we re-evaluate.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.570
Great. Where do I start?

09:33.703 --> 09:34.893
Human Resources.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.223
Get printed. Get a pass.

09:46.917 --> 09:47.891
Another banger.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.345
Dumped just off Calle Ocho.

09:54.196 --> 09:55.793
16 years old.

09:56.432 --> 09:58.124
Ready to step into the process?

09:58.397 --> 09:59.102
Yes, ma'am.

10:21.818 --> 10:22.635
So, am I done?

10:23.262 --> 10:25.558
No. Now you help me.

10:53.081 --> 10:55.211
You have now processed a decedent.

10:55.650 --> 10:56.525
You okay?

10:57.435 --> 10:58.426
I think so. Yeah.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.846
Did you send Foster on break?

11:02.206 --> 11:03.410
You have a problem, Glenn?

11:04.198 --> 11:05.591
Uh... bus wreck.

11:06.506 --> 11:08.683
Promised the company a post
before close of business

11:08.684 --> 11:11.350
and the bus driver is
still in his uniform, so...

11:11.604 --> 11:12.604
yeah, I do.

11:13.265 --> 11:15.007
Derek's picking up Foster's slack.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.664
Standing there isn't really
going to help me, Derek?

11:18.815 --> 11:19.566
On it, sir.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.274
No one passed him by me.

11:23.768 --> 11:24.614
Just did, Glenn.

11:25.219 --> 11:26.180
Let me know what you think.

11:44.891 --> 11:46.727
Blood and hair on the rearview mirror.

12:01.107 --> 12:03.521
Morgan Coleman's head wound
wasn't from a gun butt.

12:03.729 --> 12:04.969
It was from the crash.

12:13.921 --> 12:15.698
Why would he say he was hit with a gun?

12:15.871 --> 12:17.834
Well, he could say he was in shock.

12:17.882 --> 12:21.213
Or that he imagined the carjacking,

12:21.214 --> 12:22.293
but I say he's lying.

12:22.444 --> 12:23.788
There's one way to find out.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.849
If there was a third
person in the backseat

12:27.850 --> 12:30.026
when it went down the embankment,

12:30.185 --> 12:31.272
there'd be evidence.

12:31.907 --> 12:33.250
Locard's theory in action.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.037
Only prints we got from
the backseat were partials.

12:37.512 --> 12:39.439
This indention indicates someone's head

12:39.440 --> 12:41.640
hit the back of this when
the car went off the road.

12:45.995 --> 12:48.666
So if the shooter hit his head here...

12:51.553 --> 12:53.318
then his face would've hit here.

12:53.325 --> 12:55.215
If the car was moving forward,

12:55.429 --> 12:57.677
it would cause a cheese-grater
effect on his face...

13:01.106 --> 13:02.744
...leaving DNA on the grill.

13:06.861 --> 13:09.133
Felon named Victor Tinoco.

13:09.142 --> 13:10.487
Specialty is carjacking.

13:12.153 --> 13:14.017
Zebras do not change their stripes.

13:29.855 --> 13:30.656
Clear.

13:31.767 --> 13:32.568
Clear.

13:37.997 --> 13:38.748
Calleigh.

13:43.662 --> 13:45.992
Victor Tinoco, carjacker.

13:46.084 --> 13:50.207
Well, Victor is having a very tough day.

13:53.602 --> 13:55.691
We got two glasses here.

13:55.692 --> 13:59.870
It says to me that
Victor trusted his guest,

13:59.888 --> 14:03.102
and he was probably going for some ice.

14:03.137 --> 14:06.723
Projectile entered the occipital
and exited the parietal.

14:19.916 --> 14:21.525
Looks like a nine-mil.

14:22.246 --> 14:24.169
It's coated in some sort of oil.

14:24.872 --> 14:25.933
I'm going to take it to trace.

14:25.968 --> 14:26.695
Okay.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.606
Check his hands for GSR, will you?

14:34.688 --> 14:36.407
Well, well, well.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.453
It never fails. A to-do list.

14:45.506 --> 14:46.671
You get anything on the hands?

14:49.748 --> 14:51.248
There's no GSR.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.682
But his hands are filthy.

14:54.525 --> 14:56.015
Looks like there's tar

14:56.016 --> 14:57.487
on the outside of the right hand.

14:57.488 --> 14:58.810
It's probably from the embankment.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.211
But if he had washed
the GSR off his hands,

15:10.212 --> 15:12.129
he also would've washed
off the tar stain.

15:12.164 --> 15:15.054
So Victor here received instructions,

15:15.626 --> 15:17.241
but did not kill the lady.

15:18.065 --> 15:19.082
It can't be a coincidence

15:19.083 --> 15:21.661
he was shot just like Kay
Coleman, execution-style.

15:22.209 --> 15:24.435
But Morgan Coleman was in
with a homicide detective,

15:24.436 --> 15:25.331
giving his statement.

15:25.343 --> 15:28.645
Yes, but Mr. Morgan Coleman
is not off the hook yet.

15:30.433 --> 15:32.242
The paper has a watermark.

15:32.710 --> 15:33.426
What's it say?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.052
It says "Coleman Shutters."

15:50.694 --> 15:52.700
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15:53.187 --> 15:54.517
These are typed directions

15:54.655 --> 15:56.803
on where to find you and
your wife at lunch today.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.919
Typed on your company stationery,

15:58.965 --> 16:00.732
found at Victor Tinoco's house.

16:01.518 --> 16:02.260
Who?

16:02.271 --> 16:05.678
Mr. Tinoco received
instructions to kill your wife,

16:06.414 --> 16:09.878
and they were drafted
on Coleman stationery.

16:11.392 --> 16:12.256
You-you think...

16:12.646 --> 16:13.512
you think Morgan

16:13.830 --> 16:14.696
put him up to killing Kay?

16:14.828 --> 16:15.677
My brother?

16:16.731 --> 16:17.597
Yes, we do.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.288
What's this?

16:20.327 --> 16:22.267
It's a warrant for every laser printer

16:22.269 --> 16:23.814
here at Coleman Shutters.

16:24.032 --> 16:24.832
What for?

16:24.955 --> 16:27.530
Determine which one printed
up the murder instructions.

16:27.576 --> 16:29.758
Freddy, I tell you to
keep an eye on Morgan,

16:29.759 --> 16:30.613
you let the cops in?

16:32.763 --> 16:33.620
This is our brother, Sal.

16:33.686 --> 16:34.758
My brother's in mourning.

16:44.157 --> 16:44.948
Gentlemen,

16:45.293 --> 16:48.115
I understand that there is
a lawsuit against the company

16:48.116 --> 16:50.090
for the manufacture of faulty equipment.

16:50.584 --> 16:51.516
That's a nuisance suit.

16:51.668 --> 16:53.457
The decapitating of a customer

16:53.466 --> 16:54.641
is hardly a nuisance.

16:56.106 --> 16:58.473
We researched the company's background.

16:58.508 --> 17:00.840
This incident happened three months ago.

17:05.117 --> 17:09.079
A lawsuit of this size
could bankrupt this company,

17:09.115 --> 17:09.790
couldn't it?

17:09.819 --> 17:11.078
That was an installation error.

17:11.470 --> 17:14.289
We don't install our blinds.
We just manufacture them.

17:14.361 --> 17:17.102
But there is a chance that the
State won't see it your way.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.535
And by killing your insured wife,

17:19.569 --> 17:21.422
you could pull yourself out of the red.

17:22.873 --> 17:24.118
Look into that case all you want.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.156
I didn't kill my wife.

17:25.265 --> 17:26.582
That's precisely what we're doing.

17:27.053 --> 17:27.820
I get it.

17:27.911 --> 17:30.249
Lowlifes that crawl in and
out of the golden triangle

17:30.284 --> 17:32.124
are a dime a dozen.
You go after our family,

17:32.159 --> 17:33.135
you got a headline crime.

17:33.225 --> 17:35.154
Sal, where were you at lunch today?

17:36.286 --> 17:38.451
I was in my office on a
one-hour conference call

17:38.519 --> 17:39.567
with buyers in the Bahamas.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.098
Check with my secretary.
Check the phone records.

17:42.122 --> 17:43.319
That's what I'm going to do,

17:43.562 --> 17:46.287
right after I take your printers.

17:58.023 --> 17:58.872
Excuse me.

17:59.205 --> 18:00.480
We're going to need that printer.

18:00.828 --> 18:03.470
You're going to have to wait.
Morgan needs this document.

18:03.632 --> 18:06.321
Okay. A warrant trumps your boss.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.033
Be a rock star and wait.

18:09.536 --> 18:10.176
Okay?

18:14.769 --> 18:15.503
You know what.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.062
I'm going to take the printer
'cause Morgan can wait.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.183
This is a murder investigation.

18:20.835 --> 18:22.556
Sad as it is, life goes on.

18:44.459 --> 18:46.761
Have you got the bullet
from Mrs. Coleman?

18:46.762 --> 18:49.064
I was expecting Foster
or Craig to bring it up.

18:49.099 --> 18:50.630
Oh. I hired a new guy.

18:51.075 --> 18:52.485
Too new to be part of the chain.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.097
Oh, yeah, Glenn's been telling people

18:54.098 --> 18:55.786
that he's one of your
visitors from rehab.

18:57.115 --> 18:57.988
Kid's qualified.

18:58.556 --> 18:59.526
Motivated.

18:59.904 --> 19:02.147
I thought your rule was
no strays allowed at job.

19:02.539 --> 19:03.536
Yeah, I know.

19:04.622 --> 19:08.838
But if this Derek thinks twice
before he drinks and drives this weekend,

19:08.873 --> 19:10.733
I'll have one less teenager on my table.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.811
Bullet for you, Miss Firearms.

19:19.182 --> 19:20.014
It's a six right.

19:27.901 --> 19:28.758
Meaning?

19:28.811 --> 19:30.714
Same lands and grooves
pattern as the bullet

19:30.749 --> 19:31.923
that killed Victor Tinoco.

19:32.191 --> 19:34.351
You think the same gun killed them both?

19:34.490 --> 19:36.325
I won't know until I
compare them under the scope.

19:36.882 --> 19:37.616
Thank you.

19:44.699 --> 19:45.744
So each printer is unique?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.275
Yeah, each has its own signature.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.830
A laser beam runs across
a photoconductor drum.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.903
The material on the
drum releases a charge

19:53.938 --> 19:57.068
when exposed to light,
selectively removing the charge

19:57.103 --> 19:57.898
in certain areas.

19:58.516 --> 19:59.876
It's called development.

20:00.076 --> 20:00.989
I do have a camera.

20:01.970 --> 20:02.970
Good for you.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.435
Now...

20:05.952 --> 20:07.944
each printer's drum moves at a slightly

20:07.979 --> 20:08.776
different speed.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.890
That speed affects the
characters' boldness,

20:11.985 --> 20:13.245
creating minor imperfections.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.775
Look at the left side of
the murder instructions.

20:17.791 --> 20:18.894
The print's lighter.

20:19.127 --> 20:20.433
Means the drum's crooked.

20:32.437 --> 20:33.860
That would be just like this one.

20:34.672 --> 20:36.153
So, who's the lucky owner?

20:37.691 --> 20:38.562
The middle brother

20:39.481 --> 20:40.246
Freddy.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.504
Anybody could have used my printer.

20:42.539 --> 20:44.577
Seven other printers
in the office, Freddy,

20:44.585 --> 20:45.757
so why yours?

20:46.033 --> 20:47.121
Maybe someone's trying to frame me.

20:47.159 --> 20:49.861
You seem to be getting the short
end of the stick quite a lot.

20:49.896 --> 20:50.418
What?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.112
It's all in your company profile.

20:53.226 --> 20:55.734
Your father made Morgan president

20:55.883 --> 20:57.053
and 50% owner.

20:58.075 --> 21:00.230
Sal heads sales and owns a quarter,

21:00.232 --> 21:05.145
and you run manufacturing
and own only ten percent.

21:07.096 --> 21:07.910
So?

21:07.945 --> 21:09.764
So your brothers have
a bigger percentage

21:09.799 --> 21:13.037
in the company, and they
get to regulate your salary.

21:13.038 --> 21:13.904
It's not like that.

21:14.309 --> 21:15.510
Family's everything to us.

21:15.712 --> 21:18.680
Well, you have one less family
member to worry about, don't you?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.609
I did not kill my brother's wife.

21:20.728 --> 21:22.675
Then why do you seem so guilty, Freddy?

21:30.503 --> 21:32.099
I think I'm going to take the Fifth.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.334
And I'm not surprised.

21:36.424 --> 21:37.469
Alexx?

21:39.908 --> 21:41.615
Horatio says something's
wrong with this picture.

21:41.650 --> 21:43.070
We just can't figure out what it is.

21:43.457 --> 21:45.284
Could have something to do
with the drugs in that vial

21:45.319 --> 21:46.211
from her purse.

21:46.743 --> 21:48.090
Tox sent me a copy of their report.

21:52.590 --> 21:53.594
It was fertility drugs?

21:54.613 --> 21:56.924
So I did a water test
on her upper thighs.

21:57.301 --> 21:58.720
Consistent with over a year's worth

21:58.755 --> 22:00.492
of subcutaneous injections.

22:07.156 --> 22:08.322
So she was trying
to get pregnant.

22:08.784 --> 22:09.390
Not today.

22:09.738 --> 22:11.313
This woman was
wearing a diaphragm.

22:12.866 --> 22:13.525
What, you mean... you...

22:13.525 --> 22:13.866
I do.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.393
Took it out myself.

22:15.665 --> 22:16.968
Birth control
and fertility shots.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.460
That doesn't make sense.

22:19.141 --> 22:19.712
Why do both?

22:20.439 --> 22:22.522
Only thing I can think,
she was trying to get pregnant

22:22.522 --> 22:23.408
with one man

22:23.538 --> 22:25.913
while making sure she didn't
with another.

22:26.538 --> 22:26.999
Wow.

22:27.946 --> 22:28.738
Oh, yeah.

22:32.982 --> 22:34.035
What are we looking for?

22:34.106 --> 22:36.354
Evidence of
Kay Coleman's affair.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.140
Hotel charges,
restaurant receipts.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.619
Credit cards first.

22:39.927 --> 22:40.803
Okay.

22:42.363 --> 22:42.837
Whoa.

22:44.185 --> 22:45.570
Online gambling sites.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.404
Five-card stud, 21,

22:48.345 --> 22:48.984
blackjack.

22:49.670 --> 22:52.025
Gotta be $20,000 in debt here.
Card's maxed.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.102
Expensive hobby.

22:53.208 --> 22:56.107
An expensive habit.
Check her bank statements,
please.

22:59.435 --> 23:01.459
That's a big change
in her account balance.

23:01.460 --> 23:02.383
Hundred-thousand dollars

23:02.383 --> 23:03.897
to 44 bucks
in six months.

23:03.897 --> 23:05.841
Look at all those withdrawals,
made out to "Cash."

23:05.890 --> 23:08.170
Big amounts: 7,000, 8,000.

23:08.205 --> 23:10.627
But below the $10,000 it flags the feds.

23:11.751 --> 23:12.944
Who's she been paying?

23:12.979 --> 23:14.341
Bookies, illegal casinos.

23:14.376 --> 23:15.400
Wait a second. Stop there.

23:16.810 --> 23:18.523
$15,000 deposit.

23:18.558 --> 23:20.543
From her... job maybe?

23:20.578 --> 23:21.433
No, she doesn't work.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.326
There's a second deposit
as well, two months earlier.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.043
Who issued that check, Tyler?

23:27.311 --> 23:28.840
Burlington Reproductive.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.369
Why were they paying her?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.245
Gentlemen, she was
selling her eggs for cash.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.333
For gambling money.

23:34.368 --> 23:38.331
Kay Coleman was not trying to get
pregnant. She's a degenerate gambler.

23:38.366 --> 23:39.790
That widens our pool of suspects

23:39.825 --> 23:41.872
online casinos, loan sharks?

23:41.907 --> 23:44.076
She's not worth anything
to them dead though, is she?

23:44.111 --> 23:45.301
So who would benefit from her death?

23:45.336 --> 23:47.556
Somebody inside that family.

23:55.787 --> 23:57.876
Okay, so we have the
victim's background,

23:59.027 --> 24:00.994
and now her possessions, which are...

24:02.336 --> 24:04.721
Here's a lighter, but no cigarettes.

24:07.168 --> 24:08.146
Okay, that's weird.

24:08.713 --> 24:12.507
No cigarettes; of course
not, because her entire income

24:13.530 --> 24:16.362
comes from the fertility
clinic which monitors smoking,

24:16.397 --> 24:18.952
so the lighter was probably not hers.

24:19.539 --> 24:20.623
It's gold-plated.

24:21.650 --> 24:22.821
Maybe she was going to sell it.

24:22.856 --> 24:24.722
Yeah. Is there an engraving on it?

24:26.653 --> 24:27.543
"W.C."

24:32.623 --> 24:34.454
"W.C." Here you go.

24:35.237 --> 24:39.710
Warner Coleman, patriarch of the family,
founder of the business, now deceased.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.824
Maybe he left the
lighter to one of his son.

24:42.255 --> 24:45.566
Yes. Nice going. Which one?

24:46.825 --> 24:49.842
Well, if it's been used, there are
probably epithelials in the striker.

24:56.739 --> 24:57.623
Yeah.

24:58.585 --> 25:00.188
Let's get it to DNA.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.202
Yeah, it's my old
man's lighter. So what?

25:03.237 --> 25:05.006
Your sister-in-law
had it,

25:05.041 --> 25:09.614
and it has DNA on it that belonged
to a close male relative of Morgan.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.614
You're not getting DNA from me.

25:11.649 --> 25:13.068
Oh, yes, I am, Sal.

25:14.181 --> 25:14.951
Open your mouth.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.517
There you go.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.586
There's your DNA.

25:22.130 --> 25:22.896
No.

25:22.931 --> 25:24.444
Freddy, just do it so
we can get out of here.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.863
It's me. It's my lighter, okay?

25:26.898 --> 25:27.787
What?

25:28.659 --> 25:31.090
Kay and me, we used
to get together, talk.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.267
- Alone?
- Yes.

25:32.302 --> 25:33.349
With our brother's wife?

25:33.384 --> 25:34.440
She was in a jam.

25:34.475 --> 25:36.485
So you helped her with
her gambling debts, Freddy.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.464
Gambling?

25:37.499 --> 25:41.267
Yes. We found canceled checks from
Freddy's personal account made out to Kay.

25:41.302 --> 25:42.513
Isn't that right, Freddy?

25:49.399 --> 25:50.163
Thanks, Freddy.

25:50.198 --> 25:51.649
You're saving my life.

25:52.901 --> 25:54.544
How 'bout you blow some of that my way?

25:58.910 --> 25:59.869
You're a prince.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.064
Where'd you get the money, Freddy?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.589
- Yeah, where'd you get money?
- Shut up, Sal.

26:08.707 --> 26:10.720
May not have got paid much, all right,

26:10.755 --> 26:13.827
but I got a right to spend
my money on what I see fit.

26:14.551 --> 26:16.598
This is why Dad never
gave you the company.

26:16.633 --> 26:18.875
But you had found your way
around that, didn't you, Freddy?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.143
That's what Morgan told me.

26:20.178 --> 26:23.285
All right, we have a warrant
for all shutters manufactured,

26:23.320 --> 26:25.897
including those involved
in the Carson lawsuit.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.264
We don't have them. They're all sold.

26:27.299 --> 26:30.446
Then we need a list of all the
customers that had them installed.

26:30.481 --> 26:32.295
You're supposed to be
getting Kay's killer.

26:32.701 --> 26:35.155
That is exactly what I'm doing.

27:02.115 --> 27:02.975
Hey, Foster,

27:03.239 --> 27:06.249
who processed the multiple stab
wound case from Liberty City?

27:06.284 --> 27:07.185
New guy.

27:07.888 --> 27:08.769
Derek?

27:10.876 --> 27:11.641
Where is he now?

27:11.676 --> 27:13.581
Said he was taking a
quick break out back.

27:14.514 --> 27:15.513
Okay.

27:18.866 --> 27:20.593
Hey, Calleigh, Alexx.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.006
You have time to conduct an
internal investigation for me?

27:24.824 --> 27:27.010
And please don't say, "I told you so."

27:30.866 --> 27:31.948
So what you think, Derek?

27:32.389 --> 27:33.822
That no one would notice?

27:34.364 --> 27:35.433
Notice what?

27:35.468 --> 27:36.502
Don't play me.

27:36.917 --> 27:37.846
Lester Franks.

27:37.881 --> 27:39.529
The stabbing victim I just processed?

27:39.564 --> 27:42.149
Yeah, the guy who had a
flask on him when he got here.

27:42.184 --> 27:43.366
It's not in his property.

27:43.401 --> 27:44.552
I didn't take it.

27:44.587 --> 27:45.487
Body was yours.

27:46.272 --> 27:48.623
You signed it, weighed it, tagged it.

27:48.658 --> 27:50.174
What'd you think? We wouldn't notice?

27:51.989 --> 27:53.403
Can't even look at me.

27:55.038 --> 27:56.568
You got anything to say?

27:57.711 --> 27:59.230
Does this go on any kind of record?

28:01.084 --> 28:02.526
If I get corroboration,

28:03.180 --> 28:06.303
let's just say there won't be any
more county jobs in your future.

28:07.001 --> 28:08.758
No good deed goes unpunished.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.869
You're investigating the
missing flask for Alexx, right?

28:16.145 --> 28:17.922
I'm on my way to the ME Office now.

28:18.153 --> 28:19.122
I found it.

28:20.042 --> 28:20.985
You found it?

28:21.020 --> 28:22.466
In the men's locker
room behind some weights.

28:23.473 --> 28:25.201
And you just happened to
see it back there, Foster?

28:25.589 --> 28:26.755
Man, I thought you'd thank me.

28:26.790 --> 28:27.703
I'm very thankful

28:27.738 --> 28:29.417
Burns, may I have the small box?

28:31.225 --> 28:33.025
So if I find your fingerprints on it,

28:33.060 --> 28:34.661
it's only because you found it?

28:34.696 --> 28:36.642
Guy tries to help you, and
this is how I'm treated?

28:36.677 --> 28:38.863
Man, that's the problem with you CSIs.

28:38.898 --> 28:40.166
Don't trust anybody.

28:40.201 --> 28:42.628
I'll trust. Then I'll verify.

29:09.551 --> 29:11.309
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:11.344 --> 29:12.404
Hear you got a print.

29:12.439 --> 29:14.496
Yeah, I had to clean it up a little.

29:14.531 --> 29:16.212
So far, there's nothing on AFIS.

29:16.534 --> 29:18.536
Why not start with
our employee database?

29:18.571 --> 29:20.627
I told you it was an
internal investigation.

29:21.015 --> 29:22.782
It's running through employees now.

29:32.898 --> 29:35.332
"Employed by the Medical Examiner."

29:35.872 --> 29:36.834
Let me see.

29:41.949 --> 29:43.911
Doc, if you found my prints...

29:43.946 --> 29:44.777
I did.

29:44.812 --> 29:46.377
I expected to.

29:47.807 --> 29:48.943
But you, Glenn?

29:52.651 --> 29:53.901
Foster, give us a minute.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.905
Stealing from the dead?

29:58.940 --> 30:01.568
That might be a new
low even for you, Glenn.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.157
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:04.192 --> 30:07.268
The flask... you took off a stab victim.

30:07.927 --> 30:10.657
A doctor, and you
didn't even wear gloves.

30:13.402 --> 30:15.628
I've been up for two days
straight running posts.

30:16.095 --> 30:17.865
So I took a drink. Big deal.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.296
Come on, the guy's not going to miss it.

30:19.331 --> 30:20.510
"He's not going to miss it"?

30:21.394 --> 30:23.820
Glenn, we are the deceased's
last line of protection

30:23.855 --> 30:26.243
before they are put in the ground.

30:26.401 --> 30:28.674
Okay, I screwed up.

30:28.709 --> 30:29.238
I admit it.

30:29.273 --> 30:29.824
Yeah.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.311
I won't do it again. Okay?

30:32.346 --> 30:33.367
We done?

30:33.402 --> 30:37.538
No. You go to the Chief Medical
Examiner and make this official,

30:37.573 --> 30:39.163
and you get some help.

30:40.670 --> 30:41.648
Or...?

30:42.664 --> 30:43.975
You or me.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.783
Either way, this is going up the chain.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.999
According to the company literature,

30:57.338 --> 30:59.840
Coleman uses a 2024 aluminum alloy

30:59.875 --> 31:01.393
for its storm shutters,

31:03.151 --> 31:04.691
which the state says

31:04.726 --> 31:07.090
has a sufficient yield
capacity for hurricane winds.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.622
Green confirms the presence of copper.

31:14.134 --> 31:16.030
Means we've got the
right grade of aluminum.

31:18.521 --> 31:21.083
Okay, uh... nothing.

31:21.118 --> 31:22.667
What's reaction time supposed to be?

31:22.702 --> 31:23.593
Immediate.

31:24.899 --> 31:26.218
Looks like it's coming up clear.

31:26.366 --> 31:27.152
Okay.

31:28.401 --> 31:30.707
Clear indicates an 1100 aluminum,

31:31.594 --> 31:32.515
which is weaker.

31:32.550 --> 31:34.289
Weaker means cheaper.

31:34.324 --> 31:36.678
So the Colemans are
selling inferior shutters.

31:36.713 --> 31:37.595
That's fraud.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.070
Customer was decapitated.

31:42.197 --> 31:43.531
That's more than fraud.

31:47.802 --> 31:51.156
How long have you been subbing in
cheap materials on the shutters?

31:54.581 --> 31:56.702
Just one batch six months ago.

32:00.328 --> 32:02.913
She was into this
guy for-for, uh... 60,

32:02.948 --> 32:04.977
so I gave her 50,

32:05.012 --> 32:07.200
and she got ten from some experiment.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.792
An experiment?

32:08.827 --> 32:09.772
Ten?

32:09.807 --> 32:12.002
15, Freddy, for selling her eggs.

32:12.366 --> 32:13.658
She was playing you.

32:13.693 --> 32:15.231
And if I were to

32:15.698 --> 32:17.241
look at some more recent shutters,

32:17.276 --> 32:18.616
what would I find?

32:21.275 --> 32:23.164
She needed another 50,000...

32:24.180 --> 32:25.325
and then 50 more.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.189
She was addicted to gambling,

32:27.224 --> 32:29.091
and you were addicted to Kay, right?

32:30.002 --> 32:30.991
I never slept with her.

32:31.026 --> 32:32.660
And she never won at blackjack either,

32:32.695 --> 32:34.487
so you were both on
the hook, right, Freddy?

32:36.454 --> 32:39.838
Willful negligence, manslaughter.

32:40.505 --> 32:42.155
You're lucky we don't
get you for murder.

32:42.991 --> 32:43.999
He's right, Freddy.

32:44.034 --> 32:46.354
This is your opportunity
to help yourself, Freddy,

32:46.389 --> 32:47.817
but you got to meet me halfway.

32:55.738 --> 32:58.101
Kay said one of the
secretaries found out about her

32:58.136 --> 33:01.507
selling her eggs,
threatened to tell Morgan.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.929
But he-he-he'd...
he'd never hurt Kay.

33:04.910 --> 33:06.548
What was the secretary's name, Freddy?

33:07.451 --> 33:08.314
Julie.

33:09.394 --> 33:11.148
I knew Morgan would freak out.

33:12.672 --> 33:13.784
I never told him.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.027
I never told anyone.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.974
I checked Sal's alibi.

33:18.744 --> 33:19.561
Yeah?

33:20.329 --> 33:23.301
You initiated a conference
call Sal was on that afternoon?

33:24.983 --> 33:25.783
Yeah.

33:25.818 --> 33:26.814
On your cell phone?

33:28.643 --> 33:30.570
If you're trying to say
something, why don't you say it?

33:30.605 --> 33:33.643
Roaming charges already have.

33:34.268 --> 33:35.211
See, your phone...

33:35.246 --> 33:38.861
roamed to a cell tower near the restaurant
where the Colemans were carjacked,

33:38.896 --> 33:42.571
then to one by the bridge
where Kay was killed,

33:42.606 --> 33:44.322
and finally back to the office.

33:46.516 --> 33:48.713
Sal took my phone for
the conference call.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.786
He said he needed it in the field.

33:51.356 --> 33:52.493
Can you back that up?

33:55.086 --> 33:56.187
No.

33:56.222 --> 33:58.524
Then we both have a problem, don't we?

34:09.547 --> 34:10.385
Derek.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.487
I was clearing out my locker.

34:11.522 --> 34:13.194
I'll be off the property in two minutes.

34:13.228 --> 34:16.337
You knew it was Dr. Monroe
all along, didn't you?

34:16.371 --> 34:17.960
I suspected.

34:18.634 --> 34:19.788
Takes one to know one.

34:19.822 --> 34:21.226
Why didn't you tell me?

34:21.261 --> 34:22.732
That's not my style.

34:24.246 --> 34:26.319
Job's still yours, if you want it.

34:26.353 --> 34:28.005
I think I'll try Rescue.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.469
It's probably a better fit.

34:29.504 --> 34:31.012
I'm sorry.

34:32.342 --> 34:33.516
You gave me a job.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.737
You don't have to apologize to me.

34:37.436 --> 34:39.539
You're not gonna do something stupid.

34:40.031 --> 34:41.321
Don't worry about me.

35:02.233 --> 35:02.987
Hey, Calleigh.

35:03.022 --> 35:03.818
Hey.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.807
I heard we ran into a roadblock
with the Kay Coleman murder.

35:06.842 --> 35:08.538
Cell phone was at the crime scene,

35:08.573 --> 35:10.051
but can't prove who was holding it.

35:10.086 --> 35:11.440
Secretary's blaming Sal.

35:11.475 --> 35:12.928
Oh, the hothead brother.

35:13.532 --> 35:15.858
Yeah, it raises reasonable
doubt for both of them.

35:16.845 --> 35:18.149
So they're both off the hook.

35:18.184 --> 35:21.011
That is why I have turned my
attention to the second crime scene.

35:21.046 --> 35:23.839
I've confirmed that the gun
that was used to kill Kay Coleman

35:23.874 --> 35:26.231
was the same one used
to kill Victor Tinoco.

35:37.367 --> 35:38.319
But we don't have the gun,

35:38.354 --> 35:39.961
so we can't put it in anyone's hand.

35:39.996 --> 35:41.319
Well, maybe we can.

35:41.354 --> 35:42.755
There's a substance on this bullet.

35:42.790 --> 35:43.635
I took a sample.

35:44.918 --> 35:46.488
Naphthenic mineral oil.

35:46.523 --> 35:47.566
It's from the freezer.

35:47.601 --> 35:50.810
Pipes use a combination
of this oil and Freon,

35:50.845 --> 35:52.208
and they keep it under pressure.

35:52.243 --> 35:54.968
If you hit it with a
bullet, pressure's released.

36:07.411 --> 36:09.476
So, there's a chance some
oil got on the shooter.

36:09.511 --> 36:10.485
There's a chance.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.324
You're gonna need his clothes or hers.

36:22.441 --> 36:23.514
Here's my clothes.

36:25.031 --> 36:26.048
You got them dry-cleaned?

36:26.083 --> 36:27.663
Sue me. I'm hygienic.

36:28.907 --> 36:30.085
Is this everything you wore?

36:30.120 --> 36:31.676
What, you want my underwear, too?

36:31.711 --> 36:33.281
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

37:03.033 --> 37:04.699
"I'm not a religious man..."

37:06.038 --> 37:07.163
I'm not a religious man,

37:07.198 --> 37:08.196
but when I was...

37:08.231 --> 37:11.280
"...When I was lying there,
I heard God's voice..."

37:11.315 --> 37:15.110
When I was I laying
there, I heard God's voice

37:15.145 --> 37:17.225
saying my name over and over again.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.696
"Over and over again."

37:26.770 --> 37:28.378
You recommend Sal's dry cleaners?

37:28.413 --> 37:29.797
Yeah, for the prosecution.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.190
I found oil residue on Sal's shirt,

37:32.225 --> 37:36.093
and mass spec identified it as a compound
used in refrigerator freezer coils.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.177
All righty. So, where
does that leave us then?

37:38.212 --> 37:40.566
Well, so far, I've had a look
at everything on the table.

37:41.944 --> 37:43.124
We can put him to one crime scene,

37:43.159 --> 37:44.248
but not the other.

37:45.607 --> 37:46.868
What about Sal's tie?

37:48.515 --> 37:49.356
Yeah. Nothing.

37:52.204 --> 37:56.527
What about inside Sal's tie?

38:05.566 --> 38:08.839
Horatio, I don't know... I
don't know, uh, what to say.

38:08.874 --> 38:10.105
Not to worry.

38:10.140 --> 38:12.248
That's Sal's job now.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.433
Sal.

38:22.512 --> 38:23.778
So, you cracked the case, huh?

38:23.813 --> 38:25.910
Find out who presses my shirts?

38:25.945 --> 38:29.784
We also found out, Sal, that
you murdered your own hit man.

38:29.819 --> 38:33.623
Substance on the bullet matches
what we found on your shirt.

38:40.388 --> 38:43.711
I mean, what's the use of a hit man
that can't finish the job, right?

38:43.746 --> 38:45.335
So, that brings us to Kay.

38:45.370 --> 38:47.050
Striations, Sal.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.240
Same gun.

38:51.858 --> 38:54.265
Roaming charges put me
there, right, right, right.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.026
Listen to me.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.232
That secretary was there, not me.

38:58.598 --> 38:59.775
You were there, Sal.

39:01.431 --> 39:03.855
Buy it in bulk, okay.

39:03.890 --> 39:06.768
You wanted to make sure
Victor got the job done

39:06.803 --> 39:09.604
kill Kay, leave Morgan unharmed.

39:10.576 --> 39:11.308
All right.

39:25.182 --> 39:26.720
What the hell's my tie prove?

39:27.053 --> 39:28.629
Sal, on this tie

39:29.538 --> 39:30.975
is Morgan's blood,

39:31.010 --> 39:33.886
which proves you knelt
over him after you shot Kay.

39:45.911 --> 39:47.923
Morgan? Morgan?

39:47.958 --> 39:49.319
Morgan.

39:50.111 --> 39:51.322
Morgan?

40:02.476 --> 40:04.801
She was selling my
brother's future children.

40:06.662 --> 40:07.968
Coleman children.

40:08.392 --> 40:10.146
So, she deserved to die for it?

40:13.297 --> 40:14.338
Yeah, she did.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.112
Well, Sal,

40:16.147 --> 40:18.813
now you're going to
get what you deserve.

40:38.344 --> 40:39.329
Lieutenant.

40:39.619 --> 40:40.911
Mr. Coleman.

40:40.946 --> 40:41.967
Sit down.

40:52.456 --> 40:53.392
I'm sorry

40:53.963 --> 40:55.684
for the trouble we caused you.

41:00.797 --> 41:02.487
I didn't even know my own family.

41:03.889 --> 41:05.052
Well, Mr. Coleman,

41:06.962 --> 41:09.078
addicts fool people,

41:09.876 --> 41:11.726
but mostly, they fool themselves.

41:15.792 --> 41:16.881
I, um...

41:16.916 --> 41:18.984
I posted bail for Freddy.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.454
Sal's dead to me.

41:26.247 --> 41:29.376
My father left us the company so

41:30.195 --> 41:32.404
we all would stay close.

41:35.052 --> 41:36.974
You know, even the best of families

41:37.009 --> 41:39.269
have bad apples.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.315
And the rest of us pay.

41:46.283 --> 41:47.411
That we do.

41:51.034 --> 41:52.116
What do we got, Foster?

41:52.151 --> 41:53.145
Another drunk driver.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.331
Head-on collision.

41:55.675 --> 41:56.477
Yeah.

41:57.032 --> 41:58.368
Developed calves.

41:58.403 --> 41:59.897
Probably tennis team.

42:00.798 --> 42:02.069
PD catch the driver?

42:02.104 --> 42:03.293
Didn't have to.

42:03.328 --> 42:05.100
Driver was at the scene.

42:05.135 --> 42:06.563
Got thrown 30 feet.

42:06.598 --> 42:07.698
Yeah?

42:08.510 --> 42:10.229
Doc, I think it's someone you know.

42:11.449 --> 42:13.538
Driver had an ME pass on the rearview.

42:26.574 --> 42:27.708
I'm sorry.

42:29.045 --> 42:30.343
Oh, my God.

42:41.268 --> 42:44.406
I'm Alexx Woods, Medical Examiner.

42:45.311 --> 42:49.368
You're here because you're
looking for a reason not to drink.

42:49.762 --> 42:51.515
And I've got one for you.

42:54.234 --> 42:57.576
Meet Dr. Glenn Monroe.

42:58.670 --> 43:01.404
He got his medical degree at Florida U.

43:01.439 --> 43:05.011
He had three kids and two ex-wives

43:05.830 --> 43:07.152
and a mother...

43:08.062 --> 43:11.128
who depended on him.

43:12.466 --> 43:16.202
He chose to drink and drive.

43:17.746 --> 43:20.843
So, you remember Glenn Monroe.

43:21.451 --> 43:24.269
And deal with your problem

43:24.304 --> 43:27.857
before you make it mine.
