WEBVTT

00:23.232 --> 00:24.232
You okay?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.358
Yeah, just got clipped
with a beam.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.818
What the hell do you two think
you were doing?

00:26.944 --> 00:28.152
We thought we
heard someone in there!

00:28.278 --> 00:29.904
You never go in
without authorization!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.989
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.450
So torching your ass last year
wasn't enough, huh?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.285
You need to stop trying
to prove how tough you are

00:36.412 --> 00:39.205
before you get yourself killed.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.665
Yes, sir.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.293
Let the paramedics
look you over.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.969
Come on, Derek. Let's get this ladder
to the second story. Let's go.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.334
Derek! Derek!

01:36.972 --> 01:38.389
Derek!

01:41.393 --> 01:42.977
What's happening?

01:43.562 --> 01:45.938
I'm freezing.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.934
I'm fine.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.060
ER docs don't think so.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.313
Your temperature's been going up
and down like a rollercoaster.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.315
How old are these skin grafts?

02:29.441 --> 02:31.859
Last one was
about six months ago.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.322
We're gonna run some tests and
we'll get a consult with Dr. House.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.323
I'll be fine.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.326
You'll be doing
what the doctors say. Got it?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.246
I'll check in later.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.542
Hey.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.588
The way you
covered for me last night...

02:52.714 --> 02:54.257
He's my brother.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.634
I know how to eat it from him.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.012
I'm gonna stop by
after my shift, okay?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.347
Okay.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.475
So where is this Dr. House?

03:06.061 --> 03:07.812
Speaking engagement.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.274
Not guilty.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.192
And on the charge of gaining
control

03:13.318 --> 03:15.278
of said medication
by fraud, how do you plead?

03:15.404 --> 03:17.029
- Not guilty.
- Very well.

03:17.155 --> 03:21.158
Preliminary hearing is set for
the 19th at 10:00 a.m.,

03:21.285 --> 03:22.493
at which time I'll determine

03:22.619 --> 03:25.121
whether there's enough evidence to
proceed to trial.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.583
Next case on the calendar.
People versus Williams.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.376
Charge is assault
in the second degree

03:30.502 --> 03:32.420
with intent to cause injury
to another person.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.464
I see the defense has
submitted a motion to dismiss...

03:37.509 --> 03:39.176
You gonna go talk to him?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.637
I was gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.391
They have your signature
in the prescription log,

03:45.517 --> 03:47.184
a security camera video,

03:47.311 --> 03:51.397
and a pharmacist's sworn statement
saying you stole a dead guy's pills.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.274
You're already looking
at 10 years.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.068
You wanna add
a witness intimidation charge?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.863
Go ahead, ask him
about his hair.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.204
He suffered third-degree burns
over 54% of his body, a year ago,

04:07.331 --> 04:10.082
and arrived in the ER last night,
disoriented and shivering.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.336
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between 96 and 102.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.713
Why don't you contest the search
of the pharmacy records?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.549
Yeah. You could argue it violated
doctor-patient confidentiality.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.384
Except he wasn't the patient
or the doctor.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.387
He was the guy who stole
from the patient and the doctor!

04:23.513 --> 04:26.098
This was the third time he'd been
disoriented in the last two weeks.

04:26.224 --> 04:30.645
Running into smoke-filled burning
buildings can be a bit disorienting.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.272
Fortunately, I have the cure.
Stop doing it.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.650
He's not in a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.069
A hypothalamic tumor could cause
a vacillating temperature.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.363
So could ER nurses
who were too busy to notice

04:40.489 --> 04:43.616
that a patient likes
both hot coffee and cold sodas.

04:46.203 --> 04:50.706
He tested negative for Hep C, TB, HIV,
Lyme, and his tox screen's clean.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.587
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly in the mood to dance.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.590
I'm not asking you to dance.
I'm asking you to do your job.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.600
EKG showed arrhythmia.
Probably just a mild heart attack.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.979
No chest pain. And smoke inhalation
already explains the arrhythmia.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.315
The guy was in the burn unit for six
months and had multiple surgeries.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.985
Could be a hospital-acquired
infection. Maybe MRSA.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.945
Works for me.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.863
Draw a blood culture,
start him on antibiotics,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.908
vancomycin plus broad
gram-negative coverage.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.418
If you called to see the design for my
prison tats, they're still in R and D.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.253
You need to talk to Tritter.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.587
Not according to my lawyer.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.674
Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to get
the DA to drop the case. Tritter can.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.093
Yeah, you know what else
Tritter can do?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.429
You are not impressing anyone!

05:46.555 --> 05:47.680
You may call yourself
principled,

05:47.806 --> 05:51.225
but what you really are
is a stubborn adolescent idiot!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.060
- This isn't his fault!
- I'm not the one who...

05:53.186 --> 05:55.354
You used the
rectal thermometer on him.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.190
You insulted him
instead of apologizing.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.945
You flaunted your drug use in his face
and you refused to accept a deal...

06:03.071 --> 06:04.488
I accepted the deal!

06:04.614 --> 06:07.867
Not until after
you stole a dead guy's pills!

06:07.993 --> 06:09.076
Allegedly.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.871
Tritter has been opening doors
for you every step of the way

06:11.997 --> 06:14.290
and you keep
slamming them shut.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.625
There are no more openings
to give, House.

06:16.752 --> 06:20.504
If you wanna stay out of prison,
you got to make one for yourself.

06:25.343 --> 06:29.805
It's Vicodin.
You function better on it. Talk to him.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.066
MRSA's a bacteria that often infects
hospital patients.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.650
The burns on your chest and arm

06:41.777 --> 06:45.029
exposed raw flesh that made you
a wide-open target.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.239
But the antibiotics
would take care of it, right?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.450
Depends on what strain it is.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.827
We'll know more once we get the results
back from these cultures.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.830
So this MRSA thing,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.335
would it make everything
look blue?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.341
He's seeing blue.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.968
Who'd you get the scrip from?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.721
Cuddy. You wanna know
what I gave her?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.431
MRSA wouldn't change
his ocular palette.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.851
Heavy metal poisoning could cause vision
changes, particularly thallium.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.812
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.647
So maybe it's menopause.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.941
He's 28 years old.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.277
Yes, his age is the reason
it's weird that a man has menopause.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.364
Male menopause. High estrogen,
low testosterone.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.117
Explains the temperature
swings, disorientation,

07:31.243 --> 07:33.911
endocrinologically similar
to female menopause,

07:34.037 --> 07:35.996
but without the vaginas
and the mahjong tiles.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.207
Male menopause doesn't explain
the blue vision.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.378
Blue vision isn't a symptom.
It's a side effect of Viagra.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.504
It's right there on the label,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.507
which I'd had no reason to have read,
except that I'm a doctor.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.759
He's not taking Viagra.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.137
You mean he didn't tell you
he was taking Viagra.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.598
I don't care how sick he is. Trust me,
he still thinks he's got a shot.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.018
Menopause causes temperature swings,
limpness, limpness causes pills,

07:58.145 --> 07:59.186
pills cause the blues.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.397
He's presenting no other signs
of premature aging.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.690
Aging's not the only cause.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.776
You said that he's got
burns on 54% of his body.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.445
Sure it's not 55%?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.865
Burns to his genitals could
cause testicular trauma.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.409
Which could in turn cause...

08:14.161 --> 08:15.911
Run a hormone panel.
When it comes back positive,

08:16.037 --> 08:18.539
pump him full of testosterone
and send him home.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.207
Stop following me!

08:23.420 --> 08:26.005
Thank God my parents are dead.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.466
If the old man had heard
I had menopause, I'd never live it down.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.385
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.012
Once these testosterone pellets
dissolve,

08:33.138 --> 08:34.513
your system will be back to normal.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.057
Yeah, but until then
I'm an old lady.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.394
Okay to come in?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.397
It's not MRSA.
He's not being isolated anymore.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.692
Anyone not in a white coat
is welcome.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.737
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.280
I'm good.

08:51.406 --> 08:56.035
It turns out I got some hormone thing.
They're fixing it right now.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.872
Are you okay?

08:59.998 --> 09:01.916
Yeah, I think so, I just...

09:02.042 --> 09:03.834
Derek, are you in pain?

09:04.336 --> 09:06.212
- You need to get these out!
- Okay, hold on, what's wrong?

09:06.421 --> 09:07.254
- Get these out!
- What's going on?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.048
Looks like
an allergic reaction.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.258
Hold on! We're going to get
you something to stop it.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.301
- It's okay.
- No, just take them out!

09:12.427 --> 09:14.345
- But you have to calm down. It's okay.
- Get them out!

09:14.471 --> 09:15.804
- Derek!
- Get them out!

09:15.931 --> 09:18.682
Derek, let her go!

09:18.850 --> 09:20.976
Two milligrams
of IV lorazepam, stat!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.646
Get them out!

09:37.244 --> 09:39.578
The complaint department
is across the hall.

09:46.795 --> 09:47.878
I'm busy.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.090
Can I just assume that you told me
how unfair I'm being and...

09:51.216 --> 09:52.341
I'm sorry.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.140
You could throw a dart at all the
adjectives

10:00.267 --> 10:01.517
between arrogant and unhinged,

10:01.643 --> 10:04.478
and I'm sure you'd hit one
that describes me.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.399
There's a reason
I operate that way.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.778
I live in pain.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.116
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.703
And on bad ones will suck the life force
right out of you.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.957
It doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

10:25.834 --> 10:30.087
Actually,
it means I was wrong.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.260
Thank you.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.849
I know that couldn't have
been easy for you to say.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.396
Even if you don't mean
a word of it.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.442
I'm sorry.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.445
Look, you can hook me up
to a damn polygraph...

10:54.571 --> 10:56.488
And I'm sure you'd pass.

10:57.574 --> 11:01.577
The thing is I've never been interested
in what you have to say.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.289
All I care about
is what you do.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.876
I'll see you at the hearing.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.675
It wasn't
the medicine.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.386
Contamination and allergy tests
both came back negative.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.014
There was nothing to suggest
a pulmonary embolism.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.058
And his EKG
showed the expected tachycardia

11:24.184 --> 11:26.602
from the exertion of the attack.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.814
And I'm fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.360
Aggression that comes on that fast
has got to have a neurological basis.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.906
We should do a CT for a frontal lobe
tumor and an LP for meningitis.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.078
Great. Have at it.

11:50.001 --> 11:54.421
That's it? No challenging our theory,
no tearing us down?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.383
No need.
You got it under control.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.219
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs this time.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.763
To do what?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.101
Check myself into rehab.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.901
Did Tritter offer you
another deal?

12:16.027 --> 12:18.779
Nope. This is all me.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.909
So, no slaps on the back?
Encouraging words?

12:24.035 --> 12:26.745
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.373
I hope it's me detoxing,

12:29.499 --> 12:32.000
otherwise I soiled a perfectly
good pair of underwear

12:32.127 --> 12:33.335
last night for nothing.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.671
So this is for real?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.548
It's not just a show
for Tritter?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.592
Absolutely it's a show for Tritter.
And the judge.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.929
And, unfortunately, unless it's real,
there is no show.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.722
Hey, if it doesn't
help my case,

12:45.849 --> 12:48.559
at least I can go to prison
with heightened senses.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.228
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.439
Time's up. Group's starting.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.402
Gonna need to
check that stuff.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.321
When I lead
the big patient rebellion,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.657
Voldemort here
is the first to go.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.826
CT was normal,
no frontal lobe tumor,

13:05.952 --> 13:07.536
LP was negative
for meningitis.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.621
We're back to square one.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.499
What about something vascular?
Polyarteritis nodosa?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.085
Brain lesions would have
shown up on the CT.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.129
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.089
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.842
We would have seen
respiratory problems.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.678
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.430
We need to
deal with this ourselves.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.141
He can make the time!
Derek's still his patient.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.934
The man's life as he knows it
could be over.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.812
I think you of all people
would want to cut him some slack.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.608
We're treating a man who runs into
burning buildings for perfect strangers.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.193
He didn't ask for what's
happening to him.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.611
House did
everything to himself.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.029
He's been cut more
than enough slack.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.657
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.785
It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

13:48.912 --> 13:53.457
I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms
around me and tell me he understood.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.961
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.588
Well, he may never be ready.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.050
You're doing the only thing
you can do. You're trying.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.219
How about you, Greg?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.846
Have you thought about how to
fix things with people in your life?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.473
No need.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.810
The people in my life
have no expectations of me.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.479
Makes all our lives easier.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.813
Apparently not.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.316
The first step in recovery...

14:19.442 --> 14:20.776
Is admitting I have a problem.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.903
I've obviously done that
or I wouldn't be here.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.907
I've even embraced step two and accepted
that there is a higher power.

14:27.033 --> 14:31.745
Maybe not a god per se, but that
André the Giant guy was powerful.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.123
Where I start to butt up
against it is step three,

14:35.250 --> 14:38.085
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.464
I'm sure André's ghost
has my back and all, but my free will,

14:42.590 --> 14:44.007
I never leave home without it.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.093
Kind of like your pills.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.305
If you could do this on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.185
True.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.782
Everybody lies.
His tox screen.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.033
It's been clean every time.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.952
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.538
He's had extensive skin grafts,
which hurt like hell.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.040
Not everybody's House. People can handle
pain without medication.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.667
But they do have pain.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.753
This guy's worried about losing his job,
so he's hiding the pain.

15:21.879 --> 15:24.923
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out what the problem is.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.383
Or he doesn't feel pain.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.302
Either way, it's something.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.394
- When?
- Two minutes ago.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.396
Pulse is 157, respiration 42.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.023
He was fine.
He was just telling me a joke,

15:41.149 --> 15:42.941
- just a minute ago...
- Get her out of here!

15:43.067 --> 15:44.610
No fluid in his lungs!

15:44.736 --> 15:47.070
O2 stat's 85. He's hypoxic!
We're gonna have to intubate!

15:47.196 --> 15:50.282
It's not his lungs!
He's got marked ST elevation.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.492
He's having a heart attack.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.004
Pick a color.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.965
Medication time.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.722
"You are a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day."

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
He's stable.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.613
Won't stay that way.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.658
His blood tests showed
troponins and CK-MB up.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.702
Chase was right.
He was hiding chest pain.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.746
He's been having a whole series
of heart attacks.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.706
Heart attacks can't cause you
to reach out and choke someone.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.000
Lack of oxygen to the brain
causes disorientation.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.794
Increased adrenaline
causes rage.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.172
The more important question is
what caused the attacks?

16:51.469 --> 16:54.012
- Where are you going?
- To see House.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.057
We have a 28-year-old with clean
arteries, no valvular abnormalities

16:57.183 --> 16:58.016
having multiple heart attacks.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.019
I'm not gonna wait for Chase to give us
another breakthrough.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.571
- Maybe we should go.
- We don't have an answer yet.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.116
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking!

17:14.242 --> 17:17.536
Whoever came up with buprenorphine
to wean off Vicodin should be shot.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.538
Then stabbed in the eye.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.748
I think someone
needs to adjust my meds!

17:22.041 --> 17:23.917
The heart shows no signs
of inflammation or...

17:24.043 --> 17:26.795
If the cause of the heart attacks
isn't internal, it must be external.

17:26.921 --> 17:27.754
Something environmental.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.424
None of the attacks happened
in the same place.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.883
Still must be something
in common.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.635
First one happened
in an apartment building fire.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.387
Fire, water, smoke,
oxygen masks...

17:35.513 --> 17:37.013
The second and third ones
happened here.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.432
There was no fire,
no water, no smoke.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.767
His clothes were all different,
he'd been cleaned.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.562
That's the "whats".
How about the "whos"?

17:43.688 --> 17:45.480
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but...

17:45.606 --> 17:46.857
Anyone else?

17:46.983 --> 17:48.859
People don't
cause heart attacks.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.778
Well, then you shouldn't
be worried about proving me wrong.

17:58.035 --> 18:01.830
Amy? Would you come with me,
please?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.415
Anything new on my brother?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.001
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

18:06.127 --> 18:07.335
Yeah.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.100
What's this all about?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.603
I don't know.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.689
They wanted to
talk to us together.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.065
Derek!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
House was right.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.790
I don't get it.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.250
How can I be causing
his heart attacks?

18:47.376 --> 18:49.252
You may be carrying an agent
that triggered them.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.464
It could be anything, mold spores,
poisonous plant residue,

18:52.590 --> 18:54.508
something you picked up
at a fire site.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.178
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.058
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.560
You can't blame yourself
for this.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.479
You know how he got
those skin grafts?

19:07.605 --> 19:09.481
He was trapped in a fire.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.193
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire.

19:13.319 --> 19:18.448
And the ceiling collapsed, and it cut me
off from the rest of the group.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.284
And I kept yelling
that I was fine,

19:21.410 --> 19:24.746
but Derek refused to wait for the team
to clear the debris,

19:24.872 --> 19:28.291
so he took off looking for
another access point.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.045
He got caught in a backdraft.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.717
He almost died
because of me once.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.304
And now it's happening again.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.578
You're not my mom. You don't have to
keep checking up on me.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.540
How you doing?

20:08.666 --> 20:10.208
Not bad,

20:10.334 --> 20:13.086
considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.172
See this big fancy wing?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.175
It was built because
this program works.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.635
Faulty logic.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.723
This big fancy wing exists because some
people with money think that it works,

20:24.849 --> 20:27.767
wanna believe that
they can buy a better world.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.187
This is nothing short
of idealized despair.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.731
Let other people wallow in it.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.733
I don't even know
what that means.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.818
None of this means anything.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.487
It's just nonsensical slogans
and platitudes.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.907
Meaning takes time,
it takes work.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.033
What do you think
I've been doing?

20:43.159 --> 20:46.578
You've been here for two days!
Talk about wallowing in it!

20:46.704 --> 20:49.372
We all get it.
We know how much pain you have.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.666
You're here to deal with that
and get on with your life!

20:51.792 --> 20:56.379
Right! I should have an affair with a
dying patient and move into a hotel.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.217
You're a coward, House.

21:01.928 --> 21:06.264
You find fault in everybody because
you're afraid to look at yourself.

21:07.183 --> 21:11.686
Thanks. I was running short
on platitudes. You can leave now.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.238
We tested Amy for
about a dozen different agents,

21:22.365 --> 21:23.782
but they all came back negative.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.451
So she's not causing
the attacks.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.830
Derek, are you
in love with her?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.000
What does that have to do
with anything?

21:34.126 --> 21:36.628
Amy told me how
you got those skin grafts.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.505
And the way you're always
watching out for her,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.799
and I
see the way you look at her.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.682
Have you told her
how you feel?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.686
She has a six-year-old
daughter.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.689
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.442
I know.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.697
Because she did.
With my brother.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.576
They're engaged.

22:11.539 --> 22:15.000
Broken heart syndrome.
He's in love and it's killing him.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.252
I thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.837
Thanks to his menopause
and estrogen level,

22:18.963 --> 22:20.338
he basically is an old woman.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.633
BHS is an acute physical response
to an emotional experience.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.802
Stress triggers
a flood of catecholamines...

22:25.928 --> 22:29.431
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy, not a heart attack.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.641
But if you're too worried
about losing your job to get it treated,

22:31.767 --> 22:34.185
they can devolve
into full-on heart attacks.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.813
You think it's a coincidence
this started when Amy got engaged?

22:36.939 --> 22:38.648
No, I don't.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.483
But now that you
know the "why",

22:40.609 --> 22:41.985
what are you gonna do
to stop the "how"?

22:42.111 --> 22:44.988
I already put him on beta-blockers
and nitroglycerin. No effect.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.698
We need to put him
on antidepressants.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.033
Not if you're right.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.535
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

22:50.661 --> 22:52.287
which would only speed up
the heart attacks.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.665
We could try propylthiouracil,
slow down his metabolic rate.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.501
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.670
The only other option
is blood thinners.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.340
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled
arteries and a swollen heart.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.551
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to kill his heart.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.512
So buy him a girlfriend,
make him happy.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.056
That might make you happy.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.099
The only thing that'll
make him happy is Amy.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.768
So keep him away from her.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.353
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks in the room.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
What do you think will happen
to his heart

23:18.606 --> 23:19.564
when we tell him
he can never see her again?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.357
He needs a shrink.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.443
Chase's idea
is as good as any.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.363
But short of frying his brain
and wiping Amy out, he's screwed.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.411
We need Cuddy.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.579
Why?

23:34.705 --> 23:37.540
So you can tell her
why you need to fry a guy's brain.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.712
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to shock his brain.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.882
Electroshock therapy is the only way
to erase his memories of Amy

23:46.008 --> 23:47.842
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.636
This isn't 1940!

23:49.762 --> 23:51.596
The problem can be controlled
with antidepressants.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.764
Cameron?

23:52.890 --> 23:55.141
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

23:55.267 --> 23:56.518
speed up the attacks.

23:56.644 --> 24:01.147
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them will solve this problem.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.526
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin Romance in his head.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.362
We're gonna pull out
the 1940 playbook.

24:07.488 --> 24:11.699
Bilateral electrodes,
high-stimulus sine-wave intensity,

24:11.826 --> 24:14.077
turning that dial
all the way to 11.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.245
It's basic brain chemistry.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.081
We interrupt protein synthesis,
altering the neurotransmitter system.

24:18.207 --> 24:21.584
End result, no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.760
Go ahead.

24:32.763 --> 24:35.473
You heard the lady,
go plug him in.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.399
Am I really that pathetic?

24:46.277 --> 24:47.944
What are you talking about?

24:48.070 --> 24:50.488
If I had pitched
electroshock therapy

24:50.614 --> 24:54.075
as a cure for
broken heart syndrome any other time,

24:54.201 --> 24:57.787
you'd have dug in, made me try a
hundred other useless things first.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.165
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me

25:00.291 --> 25:03.418
or you just feel sorry for me.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.088
You presented
a reasonable argument.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.008
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.427
Never once
used the word "moron."

25:14.430 --> 25:16.598
The rehab's working, House.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.729
You'll still
be able to perform routine functions

25:22.855 --> 25:25.356
like walking, talking,
tying your shoes.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.318
The treatment targets
the anterior cingulated cortex.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.696
It should only affect
your experiential memories.

25:32.031 --> 25:36.034
So my parents? My childhood?

25:36.160 --> 25:39.204
If this works,
you won't remember them.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.457
Or your firefighting training.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.418
And Amy.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.339
Are you okay with that?

25:50.883 --> 25:52.926
I wouldn't miss her, right?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.429
Tell Amy how you feel.
Because if she loves you...

25:56.555 --> 26:01.726
No. I won't do that to her.
Or to my brother.

26:05.064 --> 26:09.108
You're effectively killing who you are
just to keep this secret.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.571
She doesn't love me.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.505
Caterpillar?

26:32.883 --> 26:36.219
Lower intestine
with ulcerative colitis.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.640
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

26:40.766 --> 26:45.436
Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until I
promised I'd come and see for myself.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.442
I got to admit,
this move I did not expect.

26:51.902 --> 26:55.989
Well, don't tell anyone, but the photos
of smiling people in the brochures,

26:56.115 --> 26:57.740
it's just marketing.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.119
Well, you're obviously
making an effort.

27:01.578 --> 27:06.207
So I suppose the next step is
for me to talk to the DA.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.753
Which you have
no intention of doing.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.298
No.

27:14.675 --> 27:18.803
So words mean nothing, actions mean
nothing, what the hell is left?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.103
You son of a bitch!

27:28.731 --> 27:31.399
What about your words,
your actions?

27:32.026 --> 27:36.696
"Got to get House cleaned up.
Got to get him to show some humility."

27:37.281 --> 27:38.823
But when it comes to actually
doing something,

27:38.949 --> 27:41.576
you prove that all you care about
is bitch-slapping a guy

27:41.702 --> 27:43.619
who refused to kiss your ass!

27:45.706 --> 27:47.707
You ever trust an addict?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.794
You ever give one
the benefit of the doubt?

27:51.920 --> 27:52.754
How many times
did that work out for you...

27:52.880 --> 27:53.838
Yeah, I get it.

27:53.964 --> 27:58.176
And so you were screwed over by your
wife, your mother, your partner.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.428
But you keep sending them
Christmas cards

28:00.554 --> 28:01.721
while you
take it out on everyone else!

28:01.847 --> 28:03.765
No more Christmas cards.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.476
No, I learned.

28:07.561 --> 28:11.481
People like you,
even your actions lie.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.203
I'm scared.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.579
I know.

28:27.581 --> 28:31.667
I'm gonna give you a muscle relaxant
so your body doesn't convulse.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.586
Count backwards from 10.

28:36.131 --> 28:41.719
Ten, nine, eight,

28:43.680 --> 28:45.306
seven...

28:58.946 --> 29:00.279
Go.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.462
What's your name?

29:16.588 --> 29:17.547
Derek.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.676
Heart sounds good.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.052
Do you know what city
we're in?

29:27.057 --> 29:28.266
No.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.352
Would you be okay with
a couple of visitors?

29:53.500 --> 29:57.378
Derek, it's me. Brock.

30:01.550 --> 30:06.137
I'm your brother, and when you get out
of here, you'll be staying with me.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.853
I'm Amy.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.317
I'm your friend.

30:21.236 --> 30:26.824
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember either of you.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.129
We've given him
four rounds of electroshock.

30:40.255 --> 30:44.967
The charge made his voice a little
higher, but the EKG and BP are good.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.220
Good.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.222
We're gonna give him
his last round in the morning,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.265
then be in court
for your hearing.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.600
Thanks.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.063
I'm gonna stay here.
Monitor Derek.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.110
Thanks for the update.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.826
My next condolence call is arriving.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.421
I got you something.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.092
Nice.

31:28.971 --> 31:32.682
I figured it might help make
a good impression on the judge.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.475
It's not that nice.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.648
I had no business blaming you
for any of this.

31:42.192 --> 31:46.654
I know you were just
trying to help me. Protect me.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.699
That's what friends do.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.329
Is this an apology?

31:55.455 --> 31:56.956
Part of the program.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.167
- If you don't like it, I can stop.
- Not at all.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.836
It's just so

32:03.463 --> 32:04.839
unfamiliar.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.384
Please, keep going.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.194
He looks lost.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.030
It's gonna take him a while.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.743
Brock's pulling a double shift.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.580
He can't stand to
see him this way.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.792
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

32:41.918 --> 32:45.212
I know the timing isn't great
with a wedding coming up.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.131
What wedding?

32:47.257 --> 32:49.508
Yours. You and Brock.

32:50.552 --> 32:53.554
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.849
Why would you think
we're getting married?

32:58.393 --> 33:01.937
When you first offered Dr. House
the chance to check into drug rehab,

33:02.064 --> 33:03.314
how did he respond?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.816
He told me to
get out of his office.

33:06.193 --> 33:10.780
I warned him that he could end up in
prison and lose his medical license.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.116
If he was concerned,
he didn't show it.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.202
So you continued
your investigation?

33:16.328 --> 33:17.161
Yes.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.288
Which is what led me
to the hospital pharmacy.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.583
- Turn it off.
- What did you tell the pharmacist

33:22.709 --> 33:24.794
was the reason
for your visit?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.213
I thought I told you never to call me
when I'm on trial.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.132
The memories were false.
We fried his brain for nothing.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.926
Whatever was killing him
before is still there.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.052
We did an MRI.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.471
There's slight hypo-perfusion
in the anterior cortex.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.932
What did you find when you checked
the pharmacy log?

33:38.058 --> 33:39.809
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.811
Thanks, Your Honor.
It's hard to hear.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.230
Did you test for clotting time
and LV function?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.148
I believe that this is
a medical emergency, Your Honor.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.776
His blood's normal and his
heart's pumping it up to the brain.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.361
But it's not all
getting there.

33:50.487 --> 33:51.654
Something's obstructing
the blood flow...

33:51.780 --> 33:53.489
Dr. House, you were given
adequate notice

33:53.615 --> 33:55.241
to make arrangements
for your patients.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.285
There's no hyper intensity to suggest
a foreign body near the region.

33:58.412 --> 34:00.287
And no signs of infection
or vascular malformations.

34:00.414 --> 34:01.580
It's lower down.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.957
Dr. House, hang up!

34:03.083 --> 34:04.834
The cytology on the LP
doesn't suggest a tumor.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.043
Now!

34:08.213 --> 34:09.922
Hang on a second.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.260
Does your voice always get that high
and annoying when you're angry?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.137
Do you want to go to jail?

34:16.263 --> 34:17.346
No, thank you.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.143
Set him up for a selective vertebral
angiography. I'm on my way.

34:22.269 --> 34:24.061
Dr. House.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.355
House! Sit down!

34:26.481 --> 34:28.232
Why? I'm bored.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.568
There's nothing I can say or do
that's gonna make a difference here.

34:30.736 --> 34:34.071
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.906
Get a recess.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.242
Are you out of your mind?

34:38.368 --> 34:41.162
They said they wanted me there,
but I don't think they like me.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.247
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.958
It's another symptom
of menopause.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.627
His system keeps getting hit
by women's issues,

34:48.754 --> 34:50.463
so let's follow the pattern.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.466
What might obstruct the blood flow
that's more common in women than men?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.425
Is the catheter in?

34:54.551 --> 34:55.384
Go back to court.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.677
We'll let you know
the results.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.554
Shut up and wire him.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.476
Center the image on the interpeduncular
cistern.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.478
Keep it moving at
30 frames per second.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.272
If you think the arteries are narrowing,
you're gonna need still shots,

35:08.398 --> 35:09.774
which we can do without you.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.568
The problem is not
how wide the road is.

35:12.694 --> 35:16.238
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.615
That's what's causing
the slowdown.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.409
We find him,
we find the problem.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.286
- He's wired.
- Go!

35:22.412 --> 35:24.246
Injecting the dye.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.541
Blood's in the capillaries.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.251
There.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.296
Mr. Squeegee.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.550
Spinal meningioma pushing on the nerves
to the vocal cords

35:36.676 --> 35:38.219
creates the voice change.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.388
And that nerve just happens to live
right near the meningeal branch

35:41.515 --> 35:45.726
of the vertebral artery, obstructs
the blood flow to the brain.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.604
The brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

35:48.855 --> 35:52.733
Memories cause love.
Love kills.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.987
And we didn't completely
screw up.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.907
Cleaning the slate bought us time
to find the real problem.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.742
On the other hand,
if we had been better,

36:01.868 --> 36:03.619
we wouldn't have
needed the time.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.830
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

36:05.956 --> 36:09.291
He can start enjoying real misery
instead of the fake stuff.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.044
House.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.007
I just heard that you
apologized to Wilson.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.885
Detoxing. I didn't know
what I was saying.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.020
Excuse me.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.150
I have to go to jail.

36:39.322 --> 36:42.408
What is your position
at Princeton-Plainsboro?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.493
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.662
And you're responsible
for oversight of the pharmacy?

36:46.788 --> 36:47.997
Yes.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.375
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.336
I hope you don't mind
that we continued on without you?

36:54.462 --> 36:57.756
I said I was sorry.
There's no need to be sarcastic.

36:59.301 --> 37:00.843
What is this?

37:00.969 --> 37:05.222
That's our prescription sign-out log
from December 24th.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.725
Does that appear to be
Dr. House's signature?

37:07.851 --> 37:08.934
Yes.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.185
What has he signed for?

37:10.312 --> 37:14.648
A prescription for oxycodone
in the name of patient Larry Zebalusky.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.483
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

37:16.610 --> 37:17.735
- No.
- Why?

37:17.861 --> 37:19.194
He was already dead.

37:19.321 --> 37:20.946
And Dr. House knew this?

37:21.072 --> 37:22.072
Yes.

37:22.198 --> 37:27.995
So, Dr. House had no legal or medical
basis for acquiring that oxycodone?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.208
Dr. Cuddy?

37:37.839 --> 37:39.632
He never got the pills.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.553
It's his signature.
The log is strictly controlled.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.598
Dr. House did pick up a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.559
It says oxycodone.
You testified...

37:50.685 --> 37:53.187
I know,
but it wasn't oxycodone.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.441
Dr. Wilson informed me that Dr. House
already tried to steal

37:57.567 --> 38:00.903
the pain medication of this patient,
which made clear to me

38:01.029 --> 38:05.199
that Dr. House was in a particularly
vulnerable and desperate state.

38:06.076 --> 38:08.035
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.746
Dr. House only got
a bottle with placebos.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.499
I understand your impulse
to protect a valued colleague...

38:13.625 --> 38:15.250
I have it right here
on the inventory report...

38:15.377 --> 38:18.128
Your Honor, she's lying!
She's obviously forged that report.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.588
In light of this evidence...

38:19.839 --> 38:21.715
If this is real,
why didn't she mention it earlier?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.300
I move to dismiss this case!

38:23.426 --> 38:24.843
There is other evidence,
Your Honor!

38:24.970 --> 38:27.304
Everyone shut up and sit down.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.517
Dr. Cuddy, why are you
only now coming forward with this?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.730
I guess I never expected it
to go this far.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.320
The witness is excused.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.947
Your Honor,
you can't seriously believe...

38:45.156 --> 38:47.366
Dr. House, please stand.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.955
My suspicion is your boss...

38:56.626 --> 39:00.045
My suspicion is you have better friends
than you deserve.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.257
Rules and laws
apply to everyone.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.385
You are not as special
as you think.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.179
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

39:09.305 --> 39:13.517
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

39:13.643 --> 39:15.060
but I am sure that this man

39:15.186 --> 39:17.312
is not flooding the streets
with cocaine.

39:17.439 --> 39:20.524
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

39:21.067 --> 39:22.776
he must have done something
to set you off.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.738
But you're gonna have to
live with it.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.115
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony,

39:28.241 --> 39:30.743
I'm not going to allow this
to proceed to jury.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.204
Case dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.667
Dr. House,

39:38.793 --> 39:42.254
you're still guilty of contempt
for that little walkout earlier.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.589
You'll be spending
the night in jail,

39:43.715 --> 39:46.175
and after that you're going right back
to your rehab.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.970
Bailiff, take Dr. House
into custody.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.187
Dr. House.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.281
So should I be looking for you
in the shadows,

40:09.407 --> 40:12.159
or flinch every time
a car backfires?

40:13.495 --> 40:14.912
Good luck.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.458
I hope I'm wrong about you.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.515
They got the meningioma.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.393
Your brain should start generating
real memories again.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.562
What do I do when I get out?

40:41.147 --> 40:44.525
You have people who love you.
They'll take care of you.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.862
You start over.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.289
I'm surprised to see you're not
spooning your way through the walls.

41:02.335 --> 41:06.547
So, what do you say? How about
a conjugal visit to celebrate?

41:06.673 --> 41:10.801
There's nothing to celebrate,
House! You made me perjure myself.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.387
Fabricate evidence.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.266
You make everyone around you
worse for being there.

41:20.395 --> 41:23.772
The only bright spot is that
now I own your ass.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.315
When you get out of rehab,

41:25.441 --> 41:27.818
you're gonna be
pulling double clinic duty,

41:27.944 --> 41:31.780
giving lectures to students,
helping me find donors,

41:31.906 --> 41:35.617
pretty much anything else
I ask. You got it?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.592
Your buprenorphine.

41:53.678 --> 41:56.096
You get these from
the pharmacy or from Voldemort?

41:56.264 --> 41:59.141
Voldemort. Why?
What difference does it...

42:04.230 --> 42:07.191
That's Vicodin.
He's been slipping you Vicodin?

42:07.317 --> 42:12.070
No! He'd be risking his
minimum-wage job to do that.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.245
The whole time?

42:20.371 --> 42:23.165
My higher power said
it was okay.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.000
Nothing's changed?

42:25.126 --> 42:26.877
Nothing's changed.

42:39.933 --> 42:41.308
The apology.

42:41.684 --> 42:44.603
You didn't need to do that
to make this work.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.605
Believe what you want.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.859
Good night, House.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.154
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.697
Good night, Wilson.
