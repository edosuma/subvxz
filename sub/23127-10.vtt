WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.991
- (Sally): Previously
on Being Human...

00:03.030 --> 00:05.670
- We're sort of
seeing each other.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.099
- So when it came
down to it,

00:07.140 --> 00:09.768
you'd rather die every
single day than date me.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.905
- The longer a ghost circles
the drain, crazier a ghost.

00:12.940 --> 00:16.149
- You killed all of them!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.841
- I didn't do anything.
It was him!

00:17.880 --> 00:19.939
- Sally! There is no Reaper.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.085
- Don't you get it, Sally?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.781
- You are me.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.549
- You killed them all yourself.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.718
(Grunting)

00:27.760 --> 00:28.909
(Groaning)

00:28.960 --> 00:30.485
- Sally!
- No!

00:33.760 --> 00:37.469
- (Medium): Salt binds
the spirit to the house.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.195
- Guys, let me out.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.766
(Deep voice):
I said let me out of here!

00:47.640 --> 00:50.746
We'd all like to think
that we're strong,

00:50.780 --> 00:54.910
that we're capable of
solving our own problems.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.681
- Sally! Sally!

00:57.720 --> 00:59.210
Sally!
- Yeah, not helping.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.058
- What's the
non-corporeal equivalent

01:01.090 --> 01:02.524
to cold water
in the face?

01:02.560 --> 01:03.880
- I don't know.
She's out cold.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.024
- Man, you've been around
500 years and you've

01:06.060 --> 01:07.755
never dealt with
a catatonic ghost?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.995
- I am not that old!

01:09.030 --> 01:10.668
Oh, look, I'm a vampire.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.099
I'm not a ghost whisperer.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.598
I've never seen
anything like this.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.007
- (Sally): We say to ourselves:
"I can do this.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.769
"I will conquer
this rough patch

01:18.810 --> 01:22.644
"and emerge a more confident,
a more accomplished me."

01:22.680 --> 01:25.069
- Where do you think
she is right now?

01:30.590 --> 01:31.989
(Birds chirping)

01:33.760 --> 01:35.785
- Sometimes you're right.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.527
(Laughing)

01:37.560 --> 01:40.530
Sometimes all it takes
is focus, direction

01:40.560 --> 01:42.528
and your own will
to make it through.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.598
No, Mom, I really
don't need details. Thank you.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.165
But to solve the problem,

01:48.200 --> 01:51.067
you first have to
acknowledge that it exists.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.271
And sometimes,

01:52.310 --> 01:55.007
your most challenging obstacle
isn't circumstance,

01:55.040 --> 01:59.580
isn't some external force
or another person.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.918
It's you.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.558
And in the end,

02:09.590 --> 02:13.493
most of us don't have that
strength to face that music...

02:13.530 --> 02:15.521
I smell bacon.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.894
...to admit that we're flawed.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.549
And then you're stuck.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.949
- Eggs under red.

02:34.980 --> 02:35.970
- Mmm!

02:36.020 --> 02:37.988
- Your favourite.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.454
- Mmm!

02:39.490 --> 02:40.480
You can't save yourself

02:40.520 --> 02:42.852
if you don't know
the danger you're in.

02:56.770 --> 02:57.965
(Car honking)

02:58.010 --> 02:59.330
- How do we
fix this?

02:59.380 --> 03:00.438
- I don't know.

03:02.310 --> 03:03.778
- Are we gonna brainstorm

03:03.810 --> 03:05.574
or are we giving up on her?

03:05.610 --> 03:06.680
- That's not
what I meant.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.449
- No, I get it. In a pinch,
you do what you gotta do.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.914
We should snap her neck,
call in the cleaners.

03:09.950 --> 03:10.610
What do you think?

03:10.650 --> 03:11.720
- You know what we could
also do?

03:11.750 --> 03:13.957
We could drag her out to
the woods, tie her to a tree,

03:13.990 --> 03:15.549
we could beat her to a pulp,
maybe break her arms.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.728
- Yeah, we're going there?
- Yeah.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.250
- Good! I can understand
the hostility.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.258
I got all this skin
on my face, after all.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.995
It must be hard for you
to talk to somebody

03:22.030 --> 03:23.623
with all this skin
on their face.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.627
- Hold on!
What are we doing?

03:25.670 --> 03:27.297
- I don't know. I'm just--

03:27.340 --> 03:31.038
I'm just extra
testy right now.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.634
- It's the full moon tonight.
- Yeah.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.015
That's not the only
reason I'm pissed off!

03:40.050 --> 03:41.643
- OK! Yeah.
I know, I know.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.215
(Sighing)

03:44.250 --> 03:47.379
It's been over 24 hours
since I last drank live.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.321
- And live, that's worse
or better than...

03:50.360 --> 03:52.624
- It's pretty serious
withdrawal, yeah.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.492
- Well, you need
to go find someone--

03:54.530 --> 03:56.794
- I'm not going
to do that!

03:58.070 --> 04:00.038
We need help.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.337
- Zoe.

04:08.380 --> 04:12.977
She's the only ghost wrangler
I can think of.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.512
And Sally just
shredded her boyfriend.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.279
- Yeah, I've been
thinking about that.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.488
- Maybe leave that part out.
- Yeah.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.113
- When you make that plea
to save Sally...

04:22.160 --> 04:25.084
Just omit that entirely.
- Yeah.

04:25.130 --> 04:26.359
(Door closing)

04:27.330 --> 04:29.150
(Siren)

04:30.200 --> 04:31.565
(Elevator bell dings)

04:59.830 --> 05:00.752
- Zoe!

05:00.800 --> 05:02.689
(Grunting)

05:02.730 --> 05:04.129
- Did you just
give blood?

05:04.170 --> 05:05.422
(Chuckles)

05:05.470 --> 05:07.632
- Um, I gotta talk
to you about Sally.

05:07.670 --> 05:11.300
- Sally? Sally, who eviscerated
an entire ghost support group?

05:11.340 --> 05:13.172
I don't think so.

05:13.210 --> 05:14.530
- What?

05:15.540 --> 05:17.144
- What were you
talking about?

05:19.780 --> 05:20.645
- No!

05:20.680 --> 05:23.183
- Uh, OK, listen to me.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.745
Um, Sally is
very, very sick,

05:24.790 --> 05:28.090
and we think that you're
the only hope that she's got.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.315
Please just listen.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.696
- (Woman on stereo):
** Sing a song

05:35.730 --> 05:37.220
* Sing it loud...

05:38.270 --> 05:41.240
- Aw! Friggin'
water heater!

05:41.270 --> 05:46.106
Reason 110 we need to
move out of this house.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.437
I will never
understand why

05:47.480 --> 05:49.073
you're so attached
to this place.

05:49.110 --> 05:50.100
(Sighing)

05:50.150 --> 05:51.299
- I've just...

05:52.310 --> 05:53.709
I've always felt...

05:53.750 --> 05:56.219
I don't know... right here.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.787
- But we could do
so much better.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.709
This is what happens, Sally.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.320
People fall in love.
Poof! The ring comes.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.623
They get central heating,

06:04.660 --> 06:06.185
if it actually works.

06:06.230 --> 06:10.519
Listen, we've got the
engagement party this weekend.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.390
All of our friends
will be here.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.863
We could make it
a dual celebration.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.833
(Laughing)

06:15.870 --> 06:16.860
Moving on?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.309
Moving out.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.138
Think about it?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.705
- * Light, light, lighter

06:21.740 --> 06:25.699
* You can be outside

06:25.750 --> 06:27.809
* The light

06:27.850 --> 06:29.841
* Is bright, bright, brighter

06:29.890 --> 06:31.688
* Bright, bright,
brighter... *

06:43.370 --> 06:47.466
- I know I'm risking a total
repeat of the Nora debacle,

06:47.500 --> 06:48.831
but can you blame me?

06:48.870 --> 06:51.510
I mean, Julia
represents everything

06:51.540 --> 06:52.939
that I thought
I'd never have.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.108
And honestly-- I mean,
can we be honest here?

06:55.140 --> 06:59.748
She is way hotter
than when I left.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.770
(Door opening)

07:00.820 --> 07:02.788
And we're back?
Did you find her?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.584
Oh, thank God!

07:04.620 --> 07:06.179
Zoe, welcome.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.294
- All right.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.651
Start from
the beginning.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.169
- Uh, OK, well,
we came home

07:18.200 --> 07:20.965
and Sally was
different,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.536
like something else
had taken over.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.664
And then
she goes all...

07:26.610 --> 07:28.578
Linda Blair hell spawn
on us and --

07:28.610 --> 07:30.749
I don't think I'm
exaggerating here --

07:30.780 --> 07:32.202
tries to kill us

07:32.250 --> 07:34.571
like you do when
you're a hell spawn.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.442
- Right, so we dispersed her
with a fire iron,

07:37.490 --> 07:39.584
she pops up here on
the landing where she died,

07:39.620 --> 07:41.281
and here we are,
lights out.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.549
- Idiot.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.183
- Excuse me?

07:44.230 --> 07:45.652
- Oh, not you.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.727
Well, sort of you,
but mostly me.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.194
I should've
seen this coming.

07:49.230 --> 07:52.632
I mean, the first time
Sally mentioned the Reaper--

07:52.670 --> 07:54.934
- Reaper? What?
Did I miss something?

07:54.970 --> 07:57.962
- Yeah, Sally thought that there
was a reaper sent to kill her

07:58.010 --> 07:59.500
when she passed up her door.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.338
And then the reaper
offered her a job.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.131
It was a thing.

08:02.180 --> 08:04.706
- The shadow guy
from her dream door?

08:04.750 --> 08:08.641
- Yeah, I think the Reaper
is, like, her alter.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.479
I mean, everything he's
supposed to stand for,

08:11.520 --> 08:13.750
balancing the
universe, judgement...

08:13.790 --> 08:15.610
- You're saying she thought
she tipped the scales

08:15.660 --> 08:17.651
when she passed up her door?

08:17.690 --> 08:19.158
I mean, she was waiting
for the worst.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.726
- And then she
made it happen.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.990
- Good. All right.
We fight back.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.919
- OK, what if
this Reaper wins

08:24.970 --> 08:27.291
and we can't pull
Sally out of this?

08:27.340 --> 08:32.676
- If the Reaper wins I
think that means he wins.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.804
He takes over Sally
as we know her

08:34.840 --> 08:39.676
and when she wakes up,
it wouldn't be her anymore.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.414
(Sighing)

08:43.450 --> 08:44.849
But we can talk to her.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.449
Maybe she can hear us.

08:46.490 --> 08:47.651
- She can't hear me.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.250
I've been talking
to her all day.

08:55.060 --> 08:59.019
- Oh, come on, Justin.
You met her at a Dane Cook show.

08:59.070 --> 09:02.563
She's your plus one?
Kill me.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.465
(Scoffs)

09:04.510 --> 09:05.602
(* Chiming )

09:06.680 --> 09:08.830
Hmm!

09:11.980 --> 09:13.414
(Beeping)

09:13.450 --> 09:15.418
(Ding)

09:17.550 --> 09:20.611
(Dinging)

09:24.390 --> 09:26.529
OK, Aidan.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.450
Freaking me out
a little here.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.595
Wrong Sally, son.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.790
(Beeping)

09:39.780 --> 09:40.906
(* Chiming )

09:43.380 --> 09:45.348
Yeah, no.

09:46.350 --> 09:47.715
(* Chiming )

09:47.750 --> 09:49.639
Bye, weirdo.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.521
(* Chiming )

10:18.950 --> 10:19.917
- Is this good?

10:19.950 --> 10:21.509
- She's talking back.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.917
We're reaching her.
Aidan, keep talking.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.544
- Sally, we're here for you.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.718
Can you hear us?

10:31.690 --> 10:34.125
- Quit, quit, quit...

10:34.160 --> 10:35.958
What the hell?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.559
(Keyboard clicking)

10:39.470 --> 10:40.938
Ah! Oh my god!

10:40.970 --> 10:42.438
- Shhh!

10:42.470 --> 10:44.802
- Scott, you scared
the crap out of me!

10:44.840 --> 10:46.399
- It's OK!

10:46.440 --> 10:47.430
- Oh...

10:47.480 --> 10:48.709
- It's OK.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.447
- What's wrong?

10:50.480 --> 10:54.576
- This guy online just
kept sending me messages.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.475
I quit chat and
I just shut it down

10:56.520 --> 10:58.079
and it just
kept coming back.

11:00.690 --> 11:02.215
- It's probably
just a virus.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.581
I'll take it to
my guy at work.

11:05.590 --> 11:07.524
Don't worry.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.449
I'll fix it, babe.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.418
(Slamming)

11:32.790 --> 11:35.054
- (Josh):
Did she just lock us in?

11:43.130 --> 11:45.019
- Are you kidding me?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.900
(Grunting)

11:53.140 --> 11:54.835
You see this?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.177
- The whole house
is sealed shut.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.975
Uh, she-- He-- They--
They locked us in.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.114
- Why? What did we do?

12:00.150 --> 12:01.447
- I don't know!

12:01.480 --> 12:02.845
- Really, Sally? Really?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.984
You know it's past 4:00.
- I know.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.317
- Full moon's up in
4 hours. If I'm not out--

12:06.350 --> 12:08.489
- Keep your voice down.
It's a little bit--

12:08.520 --> 12:10.124
- Annoying? Like nails
on chalkboard?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.525
You know what
else is annoying?

12:11.560 --> 12:15.451
There is a human being
walking around upstairs

12:15.500 --> 12:19.562
who has no idea that if we're
not out of here, she's dinner.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.932
- Don't you think you're
being a touch dramatic?

12:21.970 --> 12:23.563
- You are not
credible right now!

12:23.610 --> 12:25.066
Incidentally, when
were you planning

12:25.110 --> 12:27.078
on letting me in on
this Reaper situation?

12:27.110 --> 12:29.875
Our best friend gets recruited
to be a supernatural assassin,

12:29.910 --> 12:31.776
you figure, keep
Josh in the dark.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.039
- Sally didn't
want you involved.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.549
All this stuff with Nora, she
thought you couldn't handle it.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.710
- Oh, but you can? What about
you and any of your behaviour

12:39.750 --> 12:41.912
in the last several months
suggests that you can handle it?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.827
- Obviously I didn't, so-- - Because
you can't think straight, right?

12:44.860 --> 12:47.022
Because you haven't killed
anyone in the past several hours.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.721
- Let's make
something clear.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.161
Your hands aren't
exactly clean either.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.737
- I checked all
the windows upstairs.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.761
Nothing's moving
or breaking.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.167
- It--it-- I'm
sure it'll pass.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.599
It's just Sally
being Sally.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.630
- Silly Sally.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.476
- So silly.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.604
- What? We're screwed!
- Thank you, I--

13:04.650 --> 13:06.812
- You've seen this before,
right? She'll snap out of this?

13:06.850 --> 13:08.648
- Not necessarily.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.819
And i-i-if she doesn't,
what's your plan?

13:10.850 --> 13:13.956
You can't just shack up
with a ghost shredder.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.515
You'd have to--
- Exorcize her?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.279
- You can't let her,
that, run free.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.991
I mean, even if
you exorcize her,

13:20.030 --> 13:22.897
she'd still be out there,
just in a different place.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.024
Unless we can figure
out how to shred--

13:25.070 --> 13:27.164
- No, no!
Absolutely not.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.278
- There's something
we can try.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.879
- (Woman 1 on TV): What is
with you, anyway?

13:38.910 --> 13:41.675
- Wow, you murdered
that bowl.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.812
- Where are you going?

13:42.850 --> 13:44.545
- (Man 1);
What the hell...

13:44.590 --> 13:45.910
- What you gonna
do about it?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.759
(Chuckles)

13:47.790 --> 13:50.555
- (Woman 2): To better
my life in the streets.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.252
- With extra
cheesy powder, please!

13:53.300 --> 13:55.325
- (Woman 3):
I was expecting someone...

13:55.360 --> 13:56.964
- (Man 2):
Today's my birthday.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.820
- Today's not your
birthday, Andrew.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.634
- I won't stay long.
I promise.

14:00.670 --> 14:01.740
- Fine!

14:01.770 --> 14:06.879
- (Aidan, echoing):
You seen this before, right?

14:06.910 --> 14:07.832
- (Josh, echoing):
Sally?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.735
(Footsteps)

14:09.780 --> 14:11.942
(Josh talking, indistinct)

14:15.980 --> 14:19.280
I've been talking
to her all day.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.084
- (Zoe):
Maybe she can hear us.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.853
- Sally was...

14:26.900 --> 14:28.959
- We're screwed!
We can talk to her.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.593
- Hello?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.791
- (Aidan):
Sally, we're here for you!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.809
- (Josh):
Sally, can you hear me?

14:39.840 --> 14:41.729
- (Josh and Aidan):
Sally! Sally!

14:41.780 --> 14:44.101
- (Aidan): We're here for you!
Can you hear us?

14:44.150 --> 14:46.778
Sally, can you hear me?
- Sally!

14:46.810 --> 14:48.847
- She thought she
tipped the scales...

14:48.880 --> 14:50.143
- What's the non-corporeal...

14:50.190 --> 14:52.010
- Who are you?

14:54.190 --> 14:55.783
What do you want?

14:55.820 --> 14:57.925
(Voices talking, indistinct)

15:01.400 --> 15:02.720
Aaah!
- Whoa, whoa!

15:02.760 --> 15:04.262
(Panting)

15:05.300 --> 15:06.859
- Are you OK?

15:06.900 --> 15:08.834
Let's get
you upstairs.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.369
- It started yesterday.

15:17.410 --> 15:18.445
(Crickets chirping)

15:18.480 --> 15:23.111
I saw something in the
reflection on the toaster.

15:23.150 --> 15:24.879
A guy.

15:26.220 --> 15:29.952
Just for a second and
then he was gone.

15:29.990 --> 15:32.823
You think I've lost
my chickens, don't you?

15:32.860 --> 15:33.691
- No.
- You do!

15:33.730 --> 15:35.926
- Shhh...

15:36.900 --> 15:38.868
What else?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.259
- Before, the computer.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.962
- Sally, nothing
was there.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.808
- I know,
but there was.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.399
(Sighing)

15:51.280 --> 15:55.842
I used to think haunted
houses, the supernatural

15:55.880 --> 15:57.279
was just a
bunch of crap.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.287
(Chuckling)

15:58.320 --> 16:00.857
Then it started
happening to me.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.915
- Nothing's
happening to you.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.780
- What if it is?

16:04.830 --> 16:08.221
- What if the house is
trying to tell me something?

16:09.860 --> 16:12.921
Maybe it's... a ghost.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.040
- Sally.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.868
- What? What
is it, then?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.299
You tell me.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.072
- When I was 10 years old,

16:23.110 --> 16:26.307
my Dad had finally
saved enough money

16:26.350 --> 16:28.717
to move us out of
our dingy apartment.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.344
He and Mom
were so excited

16:31.390 --> 16:34.155
that I was
heartbroken.

16:34.190 --> 16:37.455
I lived in that
place my whole life.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.857
- Are you saying
that I'm 10?

16:39.890 --> 16:41.892
(Chuckles)

16:41.930 --> 16:43.466
That leaving this house

16:43.500 --> 16:45.889
is hitting me harder
than I thought?

16:45.930 --> 16:49.264
- And as the
move got closer

16:49.300 --> 16:51.837
I became
convinced that...

16:53.440 --> 16:56.410
gnomes were living
in the walls

16:56.440 --> 17:01.241
and the gnomes needed me
to stay and be their friend.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.487
- Gnomes, yeah?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.113
(Laughing)

17:05.150 --> 17:07.482
- Turns out they
were just rats.

17:09.220 --> 17:12.758
Sometimes a house
is just a house.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.099
- But it felt
so real.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.019
- Of course it did.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.459
No one can trick you
better than you.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.335
(Sighing)

17:26.369 --> 17:27.804
Get some rest.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.740
You'll feel better
in the morning.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.818
I promise.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.055
- You're gonna
do what now?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.262
- I call it
a mind meld.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.133
- Uh, isn't that
just a little--

17:56.170 --> 17:57.433
How?

17:57.470 --> 18:00.440
- Ghosts are essentially
conscious energy, right?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.939
Some people are naturally
receptive to that energy.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.209
And in rare cases,

18:07.250 --> 18:11.118
some can even tap into
a conscious portion of it.

18:11.150 --> 18:13.255
- Rare, being you?

18:13.290 --> 18:15.258
- Yeah.

18:15.290 --> 18:18.089
It's super awesome
being a freak.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.466
The first time this happened,
I was 14 at a slumber party.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.468
While the other girls
were experimenting

18:26.500 --> 18:29.037
with Light as a Feather,
Stiff as a Board,

18:29.070 --> 18:32.233
I snuck into the laundry room
with my ghost friend, Tucker.

18:32.270 --> 18:35.035
He was 13 and had a highly
active imagination.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.300
He created this
beautiful fantasy world

18:38.350 --> 18:40.444
he wanted to
share with me.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.016
It was incredible.

18:42.050 --> 18:43.882
(Heart beating)

18:43.920 --> 18:46.287
- That sounds lovely,
doesn't it, Aidan?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.516
- Oh, yeah. Intense.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.483
- Melding
isn't easy.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.397
It takes a lot of practice
and a lot of skill.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.250
- So you do this often?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.359
- Sort of.
I mean, it's similar

18:57.400 --> 19:01.564
to how I connect human and ghost
energies during reincarnation.

19:01.600 --> 19:06.140
- Oh, because that is
a thing that you do.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.036
- Is there anything
that we can do to help you?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.434
- Just be quiet.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.575
It takes a lot of
concentration to get in.

19:12.610 --> 19:16.979
- Well, is there a world in
which you don't get out?

19:17.020 --> 19:21.059
I mean, if Sally stays in,
does that mean you...

19:21.090 --> 19:23.081
stay in too?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.225
- Maybe my conscious would,

19:25.260 --> 19:29.925
and my body would
become a vegetable.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.089
Yeah, uh,
that would suck.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.896
I don't know. This stuff doesn't
really come with instructions.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.883
(Screeching)

19:52.920 --> 19:55.582
- (Deep voice): Try it and
I'll rip you to shreds!

20:00.400 --> 20:02.994
- Sally.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.993
We know you're
in there.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.464
Come back to us.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.389
- (Deep voice):
She can't hear you.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.407
(Chuckling)

20:10.440 --> 20:13.137
She won't help you.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.979
- Reaper?

20:18.010 --> 20:21.969
Just let us talk
to Sally, please.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.945
- I already told you.
Sally's gone.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.515
It's just me now.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.382
And I'm not going anywhere.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.080
(Laughing)

20:33.330 --> 20:36.459
Oh, daddy bird gave all the food

20:36.500 --> 20:40.960
to his tender, helpless
offspring, didn't he?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.209
Not even a nibble
for himself.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.574
Look at you.
What a hot mess.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.499
- Listen.
- Ah!

20:49.540 --> 20:52.043
- It's like this.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.618
You need to let us
out of this house now.

20:55.650 --> 20:59.382
- Oh! Poor little puppy...

20:59.420 --> 21:00.683
(Kissing)

21:00.720 --> 21:05.021
...trapped in here
all day, not even a walk.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.983
Timing's a bitch, huh?

21:07.760 --> 21:10.149
What? No Nora to
rub your tummy

21:10.200 --> 21:12.020
and give you treats

21:12.070 --> 21:15.495
and pick up after you
crap on everything?

21:15.540 --> 21:20.376
No, it's Julia's turn
to be ruined by you...

21:20.410 --> 21:22.139
again.

21:22.710 --> 21:27.102
- Let... Sally... go.

21:27.150 --> 21:29.209
- Now you know
how she felt,

21:29.250 --> 21:32.515
left alone here
day after day.

21:33.490 --> 21:37.017
You did this
to her, not me.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.719
I'm protecting her.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.798
You're gonna rip each
other to shreds tonight.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.491
(Sally laughing)

21:45.530 --> 21:49.489
Just a couple more hours
and you'll all be dead.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.059
She'll finally
be free of you.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.579
- Uh, what?
- This isn't real.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.203
(Chuckling evilly)

21:57.240 --> 21:58.469
- We're your friends.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.740
- Some friend you are, Aidan!

22:00.780 --> 22:02.714
Am I right, Josh?

22:02.750 --> 22:06.050
Upstairs? You can
smell it, can't you, Josh?

22:06.090 --> 22:08.650
It's seeping
through the wood.

22:08.690 --> 22:13.059
No amount of scrubbing is
ever gonna get it out. Not ever,

22:13.090 --> 22:17.425
You'll always know
what he did here

22:17.470 --> 22:19.689
in your home.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.802
Some friend you are.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.401
- OK, what the hell
is she talking about?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.306
- Zoe.

22:29.340 --> 22:33.140
Sweet, awkward Zoe.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.342
So clueless.

22:35.380 --> 22:40.147
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock.

22:40.190 --> 22:44.457
Oh, these boys.
So forgetful.

22:44.490 --> 22:47.755
They forgot to tell you the
catch of this rescue mission.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.622
- Sally, please.
- Don't call me that!

22:50.670 --> 22:52.559
(Wind blowing)

22:54.600 --> 22:56.659
You're gonna die
in here tonight.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.735
And the best part...

22:59.770 --> 23:01.636
(Chuckling)

23:01.680 --> 23:04.706
...is that Nick won't
be waiting for you

23:04.750 --> 23:06.673
on the other side.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.417
(Sighing)

23:08.450 --> 23:11.249
Sally shredded him
this morning.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.757
(Laughing evilly)

23:17.390 --> 23:18.357
- Ah!

23:18.390 --> 23:20.700
(Gasping)

23:24.430 --> 23:25.625
(Shower running)

23:34.540 --> 23:38.704
** Oh, oh, oh, oh

23:42.620 --> 23:46.409
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

23:47.890 --> 23:51.622
* Come with me outside

23:51.660 --> 23:55.722
* Where the sun may shine

23:58.770 --> 24:03.708
* Come with me outside

24:03.740 --> 24:07.734
* Where the sun may shine *

24:09.980 --> 24:13.280
- Hey, Sal!
You almost ready?

24:13.310 --> 24:16.473
- Yeah, just about!

24:18.690 --> 24:20.340
- (Aidan):
Zoe, please.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.859
- You knew and you lied to me!
- I know.

24:22.890 --> 24:25.382
I'm sorry about lying.
I'm sorry about Nick.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.182
But you can't
give up on her, please.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.720
- Oh, she can
rot in there!

24:28.760 --> 24:31.627
But I don't care if
we're locked in. I can wait!

24:31.670 --> 24:33.468
She'll get
tired eventually.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.470
- Zoe, we can't think
in eventual terms, OK?

24:36.500 --> 24:39.401
We just don't-- We don't
have that kind of time.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.604
- Well, what makes your time
so much more special than mine?

24:43.650 --> 24:46.347
She shredded my boyfriend!

24:46.380 --> 24:49.611
So if I don't feel like
I'm in a rush to help her,

24:49.650 --> 24:50.640
then kill me.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.419
(Crying)

24:57.220 --> 24:59.882
- I'm a werewolf.
- I'm a vampire.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.091
- What?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.497
- I'm a werewolf
and he's a vampire

25:03.530 --> 25:04.691
and that's how
we can see ghosts.

25:04.730 --> 25:07.529
- It's like we're different
countries on the same continent.

25:07.570 --> 25:12.007
- And--and if I'm not far away
from here in an hour or so,

25:12.040 --> 25:15.078
you will be
in mortal danger.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.547
- Mortal danger, right.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.469
- Yeah, this
isn't a joke.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.239
(Chuckling)

25:22.280 --> 25:27.753
- So--s0 you're gonna turn into
a wolf and have me for dinner.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.588
- OK, listen very carefully.
He's telling you the truth.

25:29.620 --> 25:32.385
- Oh, of course.
Of course it's the truth.

25:32.430 --> 25:34.159
You get to be
the cool vampire.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.497
Everybody wants to
be the cool vampire.

25:35.530 --> 25:36.827
- We're not
making this up!

25:36.860 --> 25:37.895
- You got it!

25:37.930 --> 25:40.024
- I'm not
making this up!

25:40.070 --> 25:41.469
(Fangs clicking)

25:42.640 --> 25:44.335
(Gasps)

25:46.370 --> 25:47.678
- Holy crap!

25:48.680 --> 25:50.409
You're monsters.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.499
- Thank you.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.576
- Wow! How are you?

25:55.620 --> 25:56.576
- Congratulations.

25:56.620 --> 25:57.542
- Thank you.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.649
- Hey. Great party!

25:59.690 --> 26:01.351
(* House on stereo )

26:01.390 --> 26:03.552
- (Woman):
** Stars tonight

26:03.590 --> 26:05.627
* Tonight

26:07.560 --> 26:09.289
<i>* On me... *</i>

26:11.330 --> 26:12.593
- You were right.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.836
- How's that?

26:13.870 --> 26:15.531
- Tonight, having
everyone here.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.732
It just-- It does
feel like the right way

26:17.770 --> 26:19.499
to say goodbye
to this place.

26:19.540 --> 26:20.462
- Really?

26:20.510 --> 26:21.500
- Really.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.507
Ah! Hot!

26:22.540 --> 26:23.473
(Laughing)

26:23.510 --> 26:24.477
Hot! Hot!
Ow, ow!

26:24.510 --> 26:25.409
(Giggling)

26:25.450 --> 26:27.942
- Oh! It's high time
we left this place.

26:27.980 --> 26:30.369
I'm so glad
you see it.

26:54.510 --> 26:55.739
(All chattering)

27:11.260 --> 27:12.352
- It smells like

27:12.390 --> 27:15.496
a slaughterhouse
up in your room, Aidan!

27:15.530 --> 27:17.965
None of those doors are
gonna last more than 5 seconds.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.867
The wolf's gonna smell
the blood and go nuts

27:20.900 --> 27:23.039
and then he'll smell Zoe
and go even more nuts!

27:23.070 --> 27:24.333
He's gonna rip
through this place

27:24.370 --> 27:25.860
like it was made
of cardboard!

27:27.740 --> 27:30.072
Really? You're just
gonna leave Zoe there

27:30.110 --> 27:32.442
with Miss Dead by Dawn
Swallow Your Soul?

27:32.480 --> 27:34.574
Go sit with her!

27:34.620 --> 27:35.815
Come on!

27:35.850 --> 27:36.976
(Josh sighing)

27:37.020 --> 27:38.784
I gotta think.

27:38.820 --> 27:39.844
I gotta think.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.886
(Sighing)

27:42.920 --> 27:44.957
Oh my god!

27:51.930 --> 27:53.625
(Sniffing)

27:57.740 --> 27:59.504
Hello.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.143
I--I--I'm gonna need a power
drill and some ratchet straps.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.739
Or a chain.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.809
Or s-something.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.780
I'm gonna change in
the friggin" fridge.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.719
Come on!

28:25.770 --> 28:26.919
Come on!

28:29.040 --> 28:30.929
(Grunting)

28:32.640 --> 28:33.778
Aidan!

28:33.810 --> 28:35.835
Get your ass in here!

28:35.880 --> 28:38.975
(Heart pounding)

28:44.150 --> 28:45.515
(Cork pops)

28:45.550 --> 28:46.688
- Oh!
- Aaah!

28:46.720 --> 28:48.154
Oh my god!

28:48.190 --> 28:49.487
- Sorry.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.612
Did I get ya?

28:50.660 --> 28:51.684
- Reaper.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.749
Here, some napkins.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.552
- Oh my god!
Thank you.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.795
- No problem.

28:57.830 --> 28:58.900
- I'm sorry.
I don't think we've met.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.967
Are you a friend
of Scott's?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.594
- No, Sally.
I'm your friend.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.438
I'm Zoe.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.801
Try to remember.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.535
- Remember...

29:08.580 --> 29:09.809
- Reality.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.899
None of this is real.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.645
You're living
in a dream world

29:13.680 --> 29:16.069
and you need
to wake up now.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.680
- Oh, wait. You're--

29:18.720 --> 29:21.610
Yeah, you're Melinda, right?

29:21.660 --> 29:23.924
You're Scott's improv
friend from college.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.883
- Scott is not who
you think he is.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.798
He's dangerous,
but he isn't real.

29:29.830 --> 29:30.991
He's trying to
make you forget,

29:31.030 --> 29:33.226
trying to keep you
right where he wants you.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.693
But this, this world
you're living in right now,

29:35.740 --> 29:36.866
it's a lie.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.437
- OK, um,
thanks for coming,

29:39.470 --> 29:41.507
but I think maybe
you should leave.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.577
- No, Sally.
You need to leave.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.942
Your friends, your real
friends, Aidan and Josh,

29:45.980 --> 29:48.574
they sent me here
to find you.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.317
- Aidan and-- Why are
you saying those names?

29:51.350 --> 29:52.886
- Because they sent
me here to find you.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.115
- I don't know anybody
named Aidan or Josh.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.083
- They're
your roommates!

29:56.120 --> 29:58.282
You live with them
in this house,

29:58.330 --> 30:01.095
in Boston,
in reality.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.928
- Aidan from Boston?

30:02.960 --> 30:04.598
- Yes. Yes!

30:04.630 --> 30:06.189
Aidan from Boston.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.891
You're dead, Sally.

30:09.770 --> 30:12.159
You died and you're a ghost.

30:12.210 --> 30:16.636
Right now, you're trapped
in a fantasy you created.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.605
You did things, horrible things
you couldn't live with,

30:20.650 --> 30:22.641
SO you escaped to this.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.785
And it might seem
easier to stay here,

30:24.820 --> 30:26.788
but I promise you,
it's not.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.549
- What did I do?

30:29.590 --> 30:30.989
- You killed Nick.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.828
- No.

30:32.860 --> 30:35.830
No, that's impossible.

30:35.860 --> 30:37.419
(Gasps)

30:39.830 --> 30:41.264
(Gasps)

30:41.300 --> 30:42.267
- Nick?

30:42.300 --> 30:44.132
- Sweetie,
please tell me

30:44.170 --> 30:45.808
you're Scott's
improv friend,

30:45.840 --> 30:48.104
because you're really
freaking me out right now.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.073
(Glass clinking)

30:49.110 --> 30:51.078
- Babe! Over here.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.805
(Nick clearing throat)

30:53.810 --> 30:55.039
- He isn't real.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.015
None of this is real.
Please remember.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.082
Sally, wait!

31:01.120 --> 31:02.087
(Gasps)

31:02.120 --> 31:03.679
(Skin tears)

31:03.720 --> 31:04.983
Oh! Oh, God!

31:09.660 --> 31:11.719
- Aidan! Stop!

31:11.770 --> 31:13.363
(Both grunting)

31:13.400 --> 31:14.799
Are you crazy? No!
- Let go! -

31:14.840 --> 31:17.639
- What's wrong with you?
- I need a bit more.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.661
- She's trying
to save our friend!

31:20.870 --> 31:22.929
(Both grunting)

31:22.980 --> 31:25.369
- If you ever get
in my face again, I--

31:25.410 --> 31:29.540
- What? You'll kill me, huh?
You'll kill Zoe?

31:29.580 --> 31:30.650
You're gone, man.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.785
You started feeding live!

31:32.820 --> 31:35.755
You murdered those 2 girls,
those 2 human beings

31:35.790 --> 31:38.725
under our roof!

31:38.760 --> 31:40.250
This sacred place!

31:40.290 --> 31:43.089
Does it stop, Aidan?
When does it stop?

31:43.130 --> 31:45.997
I feel like I'm the
only one trying anymore,

31:46.030 --> 31:49.739
like I'm dangling off
a cliff by my fingertips

31:49.770 --> 31:51.408
and you're up there
stomping on them!

31:51.440 --> 31:52.862
- I know! I know!

31:52.910 --> 31:55.004
Oh my god, Josh!
Those 2 girls!

31:55.040 --> 31:57.577
(Sobbing)

31:58.450 --> 32:00.942
What am I supposed
to do, Josh?

32:00.980 --> 32:02.379
What am I supposed to do?

32:02.420 --> 32:05.344
I can't survive without
blood. I need it.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.779
Everything just slipped
out of my control.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.709
I thought that
I could be different.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.923
I thought that I could
be better, but I can't.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.121
I just can't.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.252
(Sobbing)

32:20.800 --> 32:22.962
What are you doing?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.809
- I'm holding on...

32:26.370 --> 32:27.735
for all of us.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.935
Go ahead.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.718
(Sniffling)

32:34.750 --> 32:36.275
- Do it.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.243
- I can't.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.883
- Kind of out on a limb here.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.911
- Vampires don't
drink werewolves.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.109
- Why?
- I don't know!

32:43.160 --> 32:44.480
Because of the smell!

32:44.530 --> 32:47.124
- Come on! _
- I always took it as a warning.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.628
Either way, it's just
something we don't do,

32:48.660 --> 32:50.094
we don't ever do, ever!

32:50.130 --> 32:53.760
- If this is one of those
vampire Jim Crow laws,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.063
you need to get over it.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.159
I have blood,
you need blood,

32:57.200 --> 32:59.760
and Zoe's not an option, OK?

32:59.810 --> 33:00.834
Listen to me.
- OK.

33:00.870 --> 33:03.305
- I'm strong now, right?

33:03.340 --> 33:05.149
I can handle it.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.308
You need it.
You said so yourself,

33:07.350 --> 33:08.340
(Sighing)

33:08.380 --> 33:10.041
Just do it, man.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.014
Do it.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.484
(Sniffs)

33:13.520 --> 33:15.818
Just do it before
I change my mind.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.850
(Sighing)

33:16.890 --> 33:18.858
- Mm-hmm.

33:18.890 --> 33:20.324
Oh! No.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.499
- Oh, come on!
- Just give me a minute!

33:22.530 --> 33:24.168
- I'm gonna
change my mind!

33:26.200 --> 33:27.270
(Fangs click)

33:27.300 --> 33:28.267
(Both groan)

33:28.300 --> 33:29.233
OK.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.432
(Moaning)

33:31.470 --> 33:33.108
(Slurping)

33:33.140 --> 33:35.802
- Like, it just--
It tastes different.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.899
- Diff--different how?

33:37.940 --> 33:42.013
- Oh, you know what? I just ate
a bunch of asparagus. Aaah!

33:42.050 --> 33:43.279
(Groaning)

33:45.150 --> 33:46.185
- Oh, I need to go!

33:46.220 --> 33:47.779
- What?
- Oh my god!

33:47.820 --> 33:49.379
- You--you OK?

33:49.420 --> 33:51.422
Is it bad?
It was disgusting.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.189
- No! No, no, no!
- It's disgusting.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.300
- It's good! It's good!

33:54.330 --> 33:55.456
(Sighing)

33:55.500 --> 33:57.252
It's too good. Whoo!

33:57.300 --> 33:59.792
It's, uh... Wow!
Oh-ho-ho!

33:59.830 --> 34:03.437
I feel, like, this tingling.
It's just all over, everywhere!

34:03.470 --> 34:05.302
- So we're glad
we drank me.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.502
- Weird thing is
I barely even touched you.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.201
- Yep!
- That's just-- Whoo!

34:09.239 --> 34:10.378
Huh!

34:11.810 --> 34:12.777
(Sighing)

34:12.810 --> 34:14.141
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.147
- You gonna be OK?

34:15.179 --> 34:16.272
(Coughing)

34:16.320 --> 34:17.913
You OK?

34:17.949 --> 34:19.088
(Coughing)

34:19.120 --> 34:20.849
Aidan?

34:20.889 --> 34:21.960
(Retching)

34:21.989 --> 34:23.286
Aidan? Oh my god!

34:23.320 --> 34:26.290
Aidan, Aidan!
Are you OK, man?

34:26.330 --> 34:30.051
Aidan, Aidan, Aidan!
Breathe, breathe, breathe...

34:30.100 --> 34:31.022
Aidan?

34:31.060 --> 34:32.061
(Choking)

34:32.100 --> 34:34.194
Aidan, Aidan...

34:34.239 --> 34:36.094
- Scotty, boy!

34:36.139 --> 34:37.960
How long have we been friends?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.833
- Since you stole my Lando
Calrissian action figure

34:40.870 --> 34:42.178
and blamed it
on the fat kid.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.280
(All chuckling)

34:43.310 --> 34:44.380
- So about a year then?

34:44.409 --> 34:46.139
(All laughing)

34:46.179 --> 34:49.047
Look, don't worry. I'll save
the really embarrassing stuff

34:49.080 --> 34:50.309
for the wedding toast.

34:50.350 --> 34:52.512
- (Zoe):
You're dead, Sally.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.813
You died and you're a ghost.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.454
- I guess setting you two up
was the right call, huh?

34:57.490 --> 34:58.821
(Guests chuckling)

34:58.860 --> 35:00.988
- He didn't
introduce us.

35:01.030 --> 35:03.294
- ...the look in his eyes
after the first date.

35:03.330 --> 35:05.867
I have never seen you fall
so hard so fast...

35:05.900 --> 35:06.924
- Nick never knew Scott.

35:06.970 --> 35:08.529
- (Nick):
Here we are, right?

35:08.570 --> 35:10.038
- He couldn't have.

35:10.070 --> 35:11.231
(Nick talking, indistinct)

35:11.270 --> 35:13.102
He died.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.833
Nick drowned.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.905
(Coughing)

35:19.950 --> 35:20.974
- Excuse me.

35:21.010 --> 35:23.479
(Gasping)

35:26.050 --> 35:28.985
- That's it, Sally!
You're remembering! Keep going!

35:29.020 --> 35:30.010
(Gasps)

35:30.060 --> 35:31.323
- Back down, bitch!

35:31.360 --> 35:34.057
- Scott, no!
What are you doing?

35:34.090 --> 35:36.092
(Gasping)

35:36.130 --> 35:38.462
- Aidan, just breathe.
Just breathe. Come on, man.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.968
(Groaning)

35:40.000 --> 35:40.922
You're OK!

35:40.970 --> 35:42.267
(Screaming)

35:44.340 --> 35:47.037
(All groaning)

35:48.380 --> 35:50.200
- No! No!

35:50.240 --> 35:52.004
(Aidan screaming)

35:53.010 --> 35:54.148
(Screaming)

35:58.990 --> 36:00.287
- Where is everyone?

36:00.320 --> 36:01.879
- You weren't feeling well.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.615
I sent them all home.

36:03.660 --> 36:06.027
- That's a lie.
You're in charge here.

36:06.060 --> 36:07.425
Not him.
Snap out of it!

36:07.460 --> 36:09.189
- Don't listen to her.
She's crazy.

36:09.230 --> 36:10.595
- We can help
you, Sally.

36:10.630 --> 36:12.894
But you have to wake up.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.091
You can do this.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.064
This is where
you belong, Sally.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.966
With me.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.105
Only I understand you,

36:20.140 --> 36:21.676
who you've become.

36:21.710 --> 36:25.044
- No! Look harder.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.341
(Aidan choking)

36:31.390 --> 36:32.687
- Aidan, hold up!

36:32.720 --> 36:35.212
Breathe, breathe, breathe...

36:35.260 --> 36:37.012
- (Whispering)
Oh my god!

36:37.060 --> 36:38.983
- Your friends
need you, Sally.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.624
We need you to come back
or we're all gonna die.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.924
- None of that
matters anymore.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.065
That other place,
it's a miserable world,

36:46.100 --> 36:48.068
and you were
miserable in it.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.137
I just want you
to be happy.

36:50.170 --> 36:52.400
You're happy
here, aren't you?

36:52.440 --> 36:56.877
Forget that place you came
from and stay here with me.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.379
- But my friends...

37:02.420 --> 37:03.910
- Aren't here, are they?

37:05.520 --> 37:06.612
I'm here.

37:06.650 --> 37:08.652
- It's a full moon.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.954
Sally, we're trapped
in the house.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.981
Aidan is starving.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.727
We're all gonna die
if you don't come back.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.194
- It doesn't matter.

37:17.230 --> 37:18.664
- Yes, it does!

37:22.200 --> 37:24.407
I'm not supposed
to be living this life.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.838
I've already lived.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.218
And then I died.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.279
- Sally, no.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.327
Don't leave me.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.556
You can't be without me.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.728
I'll never
let you go.

37:59.270 --> 38:01.500
- (Whispering):
I need to wake up.

38:04.180 --> 38:06.399
There's only
one way I know how.

38:21.230 --> 38:23.255
(Gasping)

38:23.300 --> 38:25.621
(Panting)

38:25.670 --> 38:27.092
(Gasping)

38:30.570 --> 38:31.708
(Groans)

38:34.310 --> 38:35.709
(Groaning)

38:37.310 --> 38:39.278
- Oh God...

38:39.310 --> 38:40.300
- Sally.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.569
(Panting)

38:44.250 --> 38:45.718
- Josh.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.687
Josh, it's getting dark.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.280
The moon. What are
you still doing here?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.549
- I wanted to make sure
that you were...

38:55.600 --> 38:56.795
you.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.229
Are you?

38:58.260 --> 38:59.568
- I'm here.

39:00.730 --> 39:02.539
But you need to go.

39:02.570 --> 39:04.163
Please.

39:22.290 --> 39:24.019
- If I could hug you...

39:24.860 --> 39:26.259
I would.

39:27.430 --> 39:30.149
I'm really, really sorry
about this, but I--I--

39:30.200 --> 39:31.622
- Go.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.399
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.229
(Gasps)

39:39.670 --> 39:41.570
(Breathing unevenly)

39:41.610 --> 39:43.669
- (Whispering):
You look like hell!

39:44.650 --> 39:46.277
(Coughs, sniffles)

39:46.310 --> 39:47.846
- You look better.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.214
I'm sorry for
what we had to do.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.360
What was it
like in there?

39:56.920 --> 39:58.422
- Um...

40:00.190 --> 40:01.749
(Sighing)

40:01.800 --> 40:03.655
It seemed good
at first.

40:07.170 --> 40:10.367
But I figure if I have
to shack up with a monster,

40:10.400 --> 40:12.266
I'd rather it
be you guys.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.301
(Chuckling)

40:14.840 --> 40:17.172
(Coughing)

40:17.210 --> 40:18.177
(Footsteps)

40:18.210 --> 40:19.177
- Zoe.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.618
(Groans)

40:23.650 --> 40:25.379
- I'm OK.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.809
- OK, well,
I--I gotta lay down.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.488
(Sighing)

40:36.960 --> 40:40.669
- Thank you
for helping me.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.897
I know you didn't want to
and I don't blame you.

40:43.940 --> 40:47.899
- You took away the only person
who meant something to me.

40:47.940 --> 40:49.874
- I know, but--

40:49.910 --> 40:52.174
- No, you really don't.

40:53.480 --> 40:56.415
So let's just get
this straight right now.

40:56.450 --> 40:59.340
I will never forgive you
for what you did.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.279
Never.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.956
(Door closing)

41:04.990 --> 41:08.654
** Not far

41:08.700 --> 41:13.695
* Tt's not far enough

41:18.470 --> 41:22.771
* Not far

41:22.810 --> 41:27.247
* Tt's not far enough

41:29.980 --> 41:34.247
* Is this far?

41:35.290 --> 41:39.181
* Much too far

41:40.490 --> 41:43.892
* It wasn't that

41:45.900 --> 41:48.767
* That I was thinking of

41:48.800 --> 41:50.461
- I want you gone.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.868
I thought I made that clear.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.478
- It's not that simple.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.514
- But this is
all in my head.

42:04.550 --> 42:06.245
- And I can't leave.

42:07.550 --> 42:09.257
I'm a part of you.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.294
So now, we wait.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.025
- For what?

42:21.070 --> 42:23.562
- For you to slip.

42:25.810 --> 42:28.336
And when you fall...

42:30.080 --> 42:32.902
the only one left
to catch you will be me.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.624
* Held down

42:52.800 --> 42:56.839
* Held down

42:59.440 --> 43:03.229
* Held down *
