00:03.046 --> 00:05.570
Okay, so what kind of job
are you looking for?

00:05.614 --> 00:08.834
A job where I can make a lot of
money in a short amount of time.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
There's a kid on YouTube
who makes

00:10.358 --> 00:12.273
a million bucks a year
opening toys.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.274
I could do that.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.623
I would do it
for half a million.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.667
You're looking for another job?

00:15.711 --> 00:16.755
You already got three.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.930
Yes, but I need more money

00:17.974 --> 00:19.497
for my sister in Turkey.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.977
She left Afghanistan
with nothing.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.066
What about prison guard?

00:23.110 --> 00:25.068
Oh, a friend of mine does that
at Franklin County.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.027
A friend of mine is locked
up at Franklin County.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.029
What are the odds?High.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.422
What's a repo man?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.555
Oh, that's when you go around
and take people's cars

00:33.598 --> 00:35.035
because they didn't pay.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.298
It's like if Robin Hood
was kind of a dick.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.822
Oh, it says they
specifically want people

00:39.865 --> 00:41.345
with military experience.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.043
Riley, we could do this.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.697
Hold on, guys, don't make any...I'm in!

00:45.741 --> 00:47.221
AL:
Yes!

00:47.264 --> 00:48.831
Are you sure?

00:48.874 --> 00:50.659
People are gonna be pissed
when you try to take their car.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.400
Have you ever driven
PostMates?

00:52.443 --> 00:54.967
Let me tell you,
people are mad all the time.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.753
When you get ice cream
delivered, it is going to melt.

00:57.796 --> 01:00.060
Yell at science.

01:00.843 --> 01:01.931

01:12.768 --> 01:14.161
Okay, I am ready.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.337
Hang on. Hazel, brief him
on the scenario.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.991
This deadbeat hasn't made
a car payment in four months.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.298
He blew all his money
on video games and candy.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.257
[chuckles]You have ten seconds.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.867

looking out his window!

Hurry!

01:28.871 --> 01:30.002
Time.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.482
What?!Game over.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.918
He hit you with a throwing star
from his porch.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.181
You never saw it coming.

Go!

01:37.836 --> 01:39.534
Freeze!
Close your eyes.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.622
What color is
my shirt?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.145
Um, red?

01:42.189 --> 01:43.407
Not even close. You've lost

01:43.451 --> 01:45.235
your situational awareness.
Hazel?

01:45.279 --> 01:48.238
Crossbow from the
balcony, you're toast.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.154
Al, you got to focus.
The enemy is out there,

01:51.198 --> 01:52.764
training harder
than you right now.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.463
Eh, maybe he should put that
energy into paying his car bill.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.248
Let me show you.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.423
Hazel?

01:59.467 --> 02:01.904
A scary clown. Go!

02:03.079 --> 02:05.908
Hurry up, he's got
a bottle of seltzer!

02:06.604 --> 02:07.953
Be careful with my car.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.694
Back off, sir, it's
the bank's car now.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.479
Don't use your Marine voice
with me.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.872
Hazel, let's go.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.048
That's how it's done.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.842
Not so easy when somebody
is staring at you, is it?

02:28.365 --> 02:29.975
Someone's coming.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.673
I need 20 seconds.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.979
I'm on it.

02:38.767 --> 02:39.811
Hello, there.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.291
Hey, what's going on?

02:41.335 --> 02:43.163
I am so sorry to
disturb you, sir.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.643
But I was passing by your
garden and I couldn't help

02:45.687 --> 02:47.210
but admire-- oh!

02:47.254 --> 02:48.994
These are such
beautiful flowers.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.735
And they look so big.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.998
What kind of manure do you
feed them-- is it pigeon?

02:53.042 --> 02:54.870
The reason I ask is
because my grandfather

02:54.913 --> 02:56.219
kept flowers up on the roof

02:56.263 --> 02:58.569
and they looked
healthier and better

02:58.613 --> 03:01.093
than anyone else's.
Later, we found out

03:01.137 --> 03:02.530
that the neighbor's
pigeons would come there

03:02.573 --> 03:04.706
for their evening romance.[engine starts]

03:04.749 --> 03:06.360
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
What the hell?!

03:06.403 --> 03:08.013
Is that guy stealing
your car?

03:08.057 --> 03:09.885
Don't worry,
I will stop him!

03:12.148 --> 03:14.019
[tires screeching]

03:18.241 --> 03:21.157
Morning! We got pancakes,
sausages, scones.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.724
There's eggs over there.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.986
Ah, damn it.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.336
I died in my sleep, didn't I?

03:26.380 --> 03:29.078
Yeah, the guys are a little
wired after their big night.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.210
Ooh, did you get a car?

03:30.253 --> 03:32.603
Nope... we got three.Ah.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.344
And I'm sending all the
money to my sister.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.651
Oh, that's a beautiful thing
for a brother to do.

03:36.694 --> 03:39.393
Don't you think, Riley?Yeah, Al's great.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.570
So the first car,
Al distracted him

03:42.613 --> 03:43.919
while I got in and we split.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.834
Like taking candy
from a stupid baby.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.270
The second one,
we followed a guy

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
to the bar,
bought him some drinks.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.534
Told him we didn't think
he should drive.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.362
So we did the right thing--
we took him home,

03:52.406 --> 03:55.060
gave him crackers,
and then we took his car.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.367
The third one got
a little hairy.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.369
I don't want to repeat all
the details in front of Hazel,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.066
but there's a Mustang
in the driveway

04:01.110 --> 04:02.677
and I finally got
to use my Taser.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.635
Can you drive me
to school in it?Absolutely.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.071
Can you show me
how to use the Taser?

04:06.115 --> 04:07.247
Not a chance.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.512
Let me just grab some
'cakes for the road.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.122
I truly do not care
if you eat in that car.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.471
Bring the maple syrup.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.820
[gasps]

04:17.300 --> 04:19.041
After I drop her off, I'll
head straight to the worksite.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.956
Get the cement going.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.568
Wow, it's been a while

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
since I saw Riley
with a bounce in his step.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.050
Oh, you should've seen
him out there, Mr. Art.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.313
He was so sharp
and on his game.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315
Not to be a bummer,
but is anyone worried

04:32.359 --> 04:35.536
that Riley's got a Taser
and now he thinks he's Batman?

04:35.579 --> 04:37.625
They're not doing
anything illegal.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.106
We are not.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.544
See? Just be happy
for your brother.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.937
All right? He's been in combat,
he can hack it.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.852
I'm just saying,
this job takes bravery

04:47.896 --> 04:51.552
and strength and good judgment,
and Riley's got two of those.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.296
Travel bacon.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.084
Oh, hey.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.912
Hey, sorry to just drop by.

05:03.955 --> 05:04.956
Is Hazel okay?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.567
Yeah, she's with my dad.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.438
What a great kid, huh?

05:08.482 --> 05:10.048
I like her.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.876
Uh, what's going on?

05:11.920 --> 05:13.530
Um, I just wanted
to give you this.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.706
Uh, we're already squared up
for this month.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.143
I know, it's extra.
Use it for something you need.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.145
Or don't need.
Use it for whatever.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.060
That's really nice.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.366
But, um...

05:23.410 --> 05:24.802
why don't you send it
to Al's sister?

05:24.846 --> 05:26.935
Uh, thanks. Be much appreciated.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.502
Do you want to come in?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.721
Can't. I got therapy.
Say hi to Freddy for me.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.030
Who was that?

05:35.770 --> 05:38.033
I'm not sure.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.253
So the car's over here
by the mailbox.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.777
I'm across the street
with my buddy.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.170
And the deadbeat is mowing
his lawn with, I'm guessing,

05:45.214 --> 05:47.085
his neighbor's lawnmower
which he never returned.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.523
So you flanked him.Exactly.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.307
Never saw me coming
till it was too late.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.222
Now he throws a punch.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.789
I dodge it and go
straight for the car.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.051
Uh-huh.
Any other time,

05:56.094 --> 05:57.400
this dude's face
would've been beating

05:57.444 --> 05:59.184
the hell out of my
fists, but I thought,

05:59.228 --> 06:01.404
we got the car,
mission accomplished.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.275
Let's get the hell
out of there.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.713
You're the doctor but that
sounds like growth to me.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.846
Mm. You know,
I notice this is

06:08.890 --> 06:11.632
the first time you've
ever used the word "mission"

06:11.675 --> 06:13.851
in any of our sessions.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.418
Although honestly,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
it's the first time
you've used almost

06:17.464 --> 06:20.031
any word in our sessions.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.599
I feel like I found my thing.

06:22.643 --> 06:25.733
Sure, when I first got back
from Vietnam,

06:25.776 --> 06:28.083
I kind of missed the action.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.824
So I became a bouncer

06:29.867 --> 06:33.044
at a strip club
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.046
Oh, that sounds kind of awesome.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.787
Yeah.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.442
Lot of farmer's daughter acts.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.315
Well, I just want to thank you

06:43.359 --> 06:45.448
because I feel so much better.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.712
I don't think I need
therapy anymore.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.454
Mm, so you don't want
to talk about anything

06:51.498 --> 06:53.761
that's happening
in any particular country

06:53.804 --> 06:55.545
in the world right now?

06:55.589 --> 06:57.547
Not really.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.246
Starts with an "A,"
ends with a "stan."

07:02.204 --> 07:03.466
I know what you're getting at.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.468
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.688
Plus, if I leave now,
parking's free.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.909
I'm gonna hold your session
for next week just in case.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.520
Uh-uh, I'm not seeing you again

07:13.563 --> 07:16.174
unless you miss a car payment.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.358
We should've taken my car--
you don't have seat warmers.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.796
You won't let me
eat in your car.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.019
You know why I think
I'm so good at this?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.892
Because I am doing
most of the work?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.850
When I was in seventh grade,

07:39.894 --> 07:42.462
a couple of us used to hang out
at the gas station at night.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.464
We'd wait for someone to
go in to buy cigarettes

07:44.507 --> 07:46.770
or lottery tickets and they'd
leave their car running.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.034
We'd hop in, drive around the
block, ditch the car and leave.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.558
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.821
I used to break into rich
people's houses and steal fruit.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.825
I could climb a three-meter wall
with a pomegranate in each hand.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.958
One time, this guy pulled
up in a suped-up Camaro.

08:01.002 --> 08:04.440
Taught myself how to drive stick
while he was doing a scratcher.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.573
One time, I stole peaches

08:06.616 --> 08:08.618
from the French
ambassador's yard,

08:08.662 --> 08:12.013
so technically I am
an international fruit thief.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.406
Hmm, that's a good
pickup line.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.627
Another time, I took
my neighbor's chicken

08:17.671 --> 08:19.237
and I wanted to sell it
in the market.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.543
My neighbor caught me
and asked

08:20.587 --> 08:21.805
"Where are you taking
my chicken?"

08:21.849 --> 08:24.808
So I said,
"I'm taking it for a haircut."

08:24.852 --> 08:26.636
What?

08:26.680 --> 08:29.421
Never mind,
the peach story was better.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.469
[watch beeping]

08:33.513 --> 08:36.603
Okay, his bedroom light's
been out for 15 minutes.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.908
He's asleep.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.170
Now's our chance.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.911
Hold this.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.699
Go get 'em.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.531
Wow, there is taco everywhere.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.233
Oh, no.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.800
The lights are on.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.758
Riley!

09:01.802 --> 09:03.368
Riley, he's up!

09:03.412 --> 09:04.935

09:04.979 --> 09:07.198

Go! Go!

09:14.031 --> 09:16.251
[whooping]

09:21.952 --> 09:23.606
Our first mistake was
we were made.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.565
Which means during our initial
stakeout we either parked

09:25.608 --> 09:27.044
too close
or we stayed too long.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.351
Our second mistake was
eating in the car.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.701
We need to focus.
We won't do that again.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.225
We had a setback
with minimal loss of equipment.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.054
We can learn from this
and they showed their hand.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.403
Let me show you my hand.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.057
I am ready to go again.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.711
Yes!

09:43.365 --> 09:45.019
[clucks tongue]

09:45.062 --> 09:46.760
What happened to your truck?

09:46.803 --> 09:50.198
Used it to put a sweet dent
in a guy's bat.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.852
Why are you smiling?

09:51.895 --> 09:53.723
I know what the problem is--
we didn't have the right gear.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.333
We need better
surveillance equipment.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.248
Yes, night vision.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.250
And a grappling hook.I'll make a list.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.948
Are you guys listening
to yourselves?

10:00.991 --> 10:04.212
Yes. But we should be
listening to the bad guys

10:04.255 --> 10:05.953
with a parabolic microphone!Oh!

10:05.996 --> 10:08.085
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Yes! Yes!

10:08.129 --> 10:10.392
Okay.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.092
Buttonhook!

10:15.136 --> 10:17.094
Nice.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.053
Eh, T-bones, huh?

10:19.096 --> 10:20.707
Yep.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.668
Want to take over?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
Thank you.
Yeah.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.237
Hazel, hit me!

10:29.280 --> 10:31.021
Nice. Go long.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.545
He's in a good mood for a guy
with a cracked windshield.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.243
I'm happy for him.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.506
And also happy it
was not my car.

10:38.289 --> 10:41.466
Do you really think it's smart
for you guys to be doing this?

10:41.510 --> 10:42.946
Oh, it's a great idea.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.556
I've already been able
to send money to my sister,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.341
my mother,
my cousin.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.125
Al...

10:48.169 --> 10:50.432
you know how people
have insurance?Mm-hmm.

10:50.475 --> 10:53.043
You're kind of your family's
insurance policy.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.784
I mean, they rely on you.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.091
Yes, that is exactly
why we are doing this.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.442
So what happens to them if you
take a baseball bat to the head?

11:00.485 --> 11:02.618
It won't. I'm very fast.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.055
But what if you do?

11:07.014 --> 11:08.755
Hey, guys.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.322
Jell-O! We brought Jell-O.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.628
HAZEL:Hi, Mom.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.803
RILEY:
There they are!

11:13.847 --> 11:15.109
Who's thirsty?

11:15.152 --> 11:16.806
Freddy, I got
that raspberry beer you like.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.068
You remembered.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.027
Sometimes it looks like
I'm not listening,

11:20.070 --> 11:21.681
but sometimes I am.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.421
Cooler's over there,
help yourself.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.727
Are you having one?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.337
No, want to stay sharp
between the ears.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.035
Since when?

11:28.078 --> 11:29.340
Good one.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.602
Let me take this.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.300
Hey, Mom, Dad got
me a football.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.171
Oh, nice.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.825
You were right.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.740
Something is
definitely off about him.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.350
RILEY:
Freddy, incoming!

11:42.223 --> 11:44.486
I'm okay.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.274
Well, Riley's in
an extra good mood.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.364
He's like a super-hot
Walmart greeter.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.149
He said "nice sandals"

11:55.192 --> 11:57.717
to Freddy, and I think
he kind of meant it.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.763
So... who's he banging?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.852
Nobody.
Oh, come on.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.159
I swear I'm not jealous.
Just tell me.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.377
It's not a girl.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.075
Well, something's going on.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.555
He told me I'm a good mom.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.166
[chuckles]

12:12.209 --> 12:14.516
He's got this new side gig

12:14.559 --> 12:16.692
with Al, repo-ing cars.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.563
I think it's exciting
for him, you know?

12:18.607 --> 12:20.217
You mean dangerous?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.610
Thank you!

12:21.653 --> 12:23.090
No one else in this house
gets it.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.221
HAZEL:
Hey, Mom?

12:24.265 --> 12:25.440
Get out here!

12:25.483 --> 12:27.616
Freddy's juggling
baked potatoes!

12:32.273 --> 12:35.102
Dude! The goggles came.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.017
Huh, you bought them.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.325
Ooh!

12:41.369 --> 12:43.414
Hold up fingers.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.416
I know you can see me.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.809
How much did those cost?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.855
Ah, don't worry,
we'll make it back.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.509
Riley, don't be mad,
but I don't want

12:51.553 --> 12:53.250
to do this repo thing anymore.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.991
What? Why?

12:55.035 --> 12:56.601
It is too dangerous.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.257
But...

13:00.301 --> 13:02.520
we can see in the dark.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.479
It is not worth the risk.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.437
My family needs me.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.137
Okay, I get it.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.878
Thank you.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.968
[clears throat]

13:15.011 --> 13:16.143
Where are you going?

13:16.186 --> 13:17.274
Going to work.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.406
By yourself?

13:18.449 --> 13:19.711
I got to finish what I started.

13:19.755 --> 13:20.930
No, you don't.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.106
Yeah, I do.
Otherwise the enemy wins.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.239
He is not the enemy--
he is just a guy

13:25.282 --> 13:26.762
who can't afford his Volvo.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.112
And he's never gonna
see me coming.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.863
Mr. Art.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.125
What are you
still doing up?

13:42.169 --> 13:45.346
Eh, I'm just enjoying
a quiet evening.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.087
And this fruity beer.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.567
Which no one needs
to know about.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.963
Why are you still up?

13:54.746 --> 13:56.836
I'm just waiting
for Riley.Yeah.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.055
He went to do
a repo job on his own.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
You know, I can't
thank you enough

14:00.752 --> 14:02.102
for getting him
into this.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.800
Seeing the light
back in his eyes.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.671
He does seem to like it.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.673
I've been worried
about him for so long,

14:08.717 --> 14:11.981
I don't even think I
realized how worried I was.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.638
So you're not concerned that
this job is a little dangerous?

14:16.681 --> 14:18.858
Eh, let me tell you
something about my son.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.251
He's always chased the action.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.644
Just like me.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.689
[laughing]: You know
when he was a kid,

14:24.733 --> 14:27.344
he used to go joyriding
in strangers' cars.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.912
[laughs]
I was so pissed.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.133
I can tell from your laughter.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.484
I did the exact same thing.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.312
Except I was even younger.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.357
So does this need
for excitement

14:40.401 --> 14:41.881
ever wear off?

14:41.924 --> 14:44.013
Eh, it doesn't wear off.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.841
It just changes.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.235
Now I get excited if I hit
a bunch of green lights.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.717
Hey! How'd it go?

14:52.761 --> 14:54.371
I got the Volvo.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.591
ART:
Yeah, you did!

14:56.634 --> 14:57.766
What happened to your eye?

14:57.809 --> 14:59.550
Ah, lucky punch.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.812
Hey, let me see that.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.205
It's nothing, really.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.772
I'm gonna grab some sleep.
I got, uh...

15:03.815 --> 15:05.774
another repo in a couple hours.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.261
You missed a good one.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.827
Guy chased me all over town.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.134
Well, I'm glad you had fun.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.701
That's your last job.

15:19.744 --> 15:20.920
No, I said I got
another one later.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.399
No, you don't.
You're done.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.401
Oh, you're in charge now?

15:24.445 --> 15:25.837
When we were on patrol,

15:25.881 --> 15:28.057
if one of us said don't go in,
we didn't go in.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.060
It's just a black eye.This time!

15:31.104 --> 15:33.236
I already have so many people
to worry about, Riley!

15:33.280 --> 15:35.891
I don't have room in my heart
to worry about you!

15:35.935 --> 15:38.589
Al, it took me three years
to find a job I really like.

15:38.633 --> 15:42.071
I'm good at it, and I'm not
gonna stop because you said so.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.684
Well, maybe you should...
slow it down a little bit.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.860
What do you people
want from me?!

15:48.904 --> 15:50.514
I mean, you don't like
when I don't have a job.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.386
You don't like this job.
You don't like when I'm moody.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.954
You don't like when I'm happy.
I can't win with you!

15:56.912 --> 15:58.609
What is going on?

15:58.653 --> 15:59.915
Oh, my God,
what happened to your eye?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.656
Oh, you want to fix me, too?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.266
I told you
this was gonna happen.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.573
Well, you're always right
and I'm always wrong, huh?

16:05.616 --> 16:08.315
I'm gonna go sleep in the truck.
I'll see you guys at work.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.669
Lizzie,
you're my favorite again.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.944
You want to explain
the Rocky Balboa look?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.339
Nope.

16:34.558 --> 16:37.431
You know, back when I was
painting houses in Detroit,

16:37.474 --> 16:40.825
there was this one little bar
that I always hung out at.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.394
The bartender was
this gorgeous redhead.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.961
Heather.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.659
She absolutely hated me.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.140
Why?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.621
Well, I was always
asking her out.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.492
Was a lousy tipper.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.494
What are you gonna do?

16:57.538 --> 17:00.323
Anyway, this one...

17:00.367 --> 17:03.326
Wednesday night after work
I was trying to get her

17:03.370 --> 17:04.980
to go out with me and...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.200
everybody started saying,
"Turn on the news!"

17:08.549 --> 17:11.117
It was April 30, 1975.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.859
Fall of Saigon.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.689
Heather asked me
if I was okay.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.952
She knew I'd fought
in Vietnam.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.305
I said, "Yeah, sure,
you know, sure."

17:28.221 --> 17:31.789
I spent the rest of that night
drinking myself stupid.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.531
I didn't go to work
the next day.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.838
Or the next.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.710
Figured they'd
eventually fire me.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.712
I never went back
to check it out.

17:46.021 --> 17:50.112
Took me a long time
to dig myself out of that hole.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.908
I don't want to talk.

18:03.952 --> 18:06.172
Oh, I know.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.787
Maybe today
we'll just do push-ups.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.094
Really?

18:15.137 --> 18:17.270
Well, you do 'em. I'll count.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.888
One, two--
Come-come on, all the way down.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.933
This ain't
the Coast Guard.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.110
One.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.242
Two, three.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.862
Too easy.
LIZZIE:
Thanks, Hazel.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.255
I don't know
where my head's at.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.170
Why do you even bother
locking this thing?

18:48.214 --> 18:51.042
It's got a lot
of sentimental value.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.306
It's got a lot of rust.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.743
Do you want your three dollars?

18:55.786 --> 18:57.788
Pleasure doing business.
