03:59.790 --> 04:02.209
Hey, Wayne!

04:03.460 --> 04:05.504
First track today?

06:27.521 --> 06:30.274
Step right up!

06:57.843 --> 06:59.887
OK, safety bars down.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.308
OK, are you ready?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.600
You a hunter?

07:52.147 --> 07:55.234
101st Airborne. Dak To. Where were you?

08:09.123 --> 08:11.875
Wow! Yeah!

08:49.163 --> 08:51.832
Are you sure you want to go on?

09:11.226 --> 09:12.519
Thank you.

09:25.282 --> 09:31.080
Hello. How are you?
Is this your first time? Scared?

09:36.919 --> 09:39.505
Everything OK back there?

10:20.004 --> 10:22.715
This is gonna be fun.
You're gonna really like it.

10:22.881 --> 10:28.012
- I'm so glad we stayed!
- Don't worry. You've got it made.

10:28.178 --> 10:30.806
I'm not gonna hold up my hands.

10:43.986 --> 10:46.947
- Here we go!
- Hands in the air, everybody!

10:47.114 --> 10:49.074
All right. Here we go.

10:49.241 --> 10:54.371
- Too late to turn back now!
- I'm gonna open my eyes.

10:54.538 --> 10:57.382
Hang on, soldier! Here we go!

11:58.102 --> 12:01.647
- I don't wanna go home!
- I wanna go home. I'm tired.

12:01.814 --> 12:04.942
You're getting spoiled.
It's time to go home.

12:05.109 --> 12:08.237
I'm gonna carry you home
like a little baby.

14:17.908 --> 14:20.577
- Too much juice?
- No.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.043
Ow!

14:28.210 --> 14:31.922
- If it's getting painful...
- That's what I'm paying for.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.383
Ow.

14:38.220 --> 14:39.705
Ow!

14:48.272 --> 14:53.402
It's not you. It's me.
You got a phone around here?

14:53.569 --> 14:57.114
- Yeah, in the reception area.
- I'll be right back.

14:57.281 --> 15:01.618
- That's OK. We're finished.
- Time flies when you're having fun.

15:01.785 --> 15:07.541
- What was that?
- Time flies when you're having fun.

15:09.752 --> 15:12.171
He always says it's important.

15:14.548 --> 15:16.884
All right. Give me the number.

15:17.051 --> 15:20.179
- Here you go. I forgot to print.
- Thank you.

15:26.435 --> 15:28.479
Thank you.

15:31.815 --> 15:34.902
Simon Davenport, please.
It's Harry Calder.

15:56.882 --> 16:01.679
Excuse me, Mr Davenport.
A Mr Calder on the phone for you.

16:01.845 --> 16:03.973
Excuse me.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.107
- Harry, I'm sorry to bother you.
- 'Then don't.'

16:13.273 --> 16:16.402
- Why do you talk to me like that?
- I don't like you, Si.

16:16.568 --> 16:21.031
After tonight I may return the favour.
Is Ocean View Park in your jurisdiction?

16:21.198 --> 16:23.325
'You know it is. Why?'

16:23.492 --> 16:27.246
When was the last time a field inspector
checked out the rides?

16:27.413 --> 16:29.832
- Two months ago.
- Are you sure?

16:29.999 --> 16:32.835
- I did it myself.
- That's unfortunate.

16:33.002 --> 16:37.047
- Did you inspect the rollercoaster?
- Of course. What happened?

16:37.214 --> 16:39.883
It just collapsed.

16:40.050 --> 16:43.595
- Jesus.
- 'People are dead.

16:43.762 --> 16:47.975
'I want you to go out there and find out
if there was negligence involved.'

16:48.142 --> 16:50.728
- You go.
- It's my wedding anniversary.

16:50.894 --> 16:53.522
- So take your wife!
- You're funny.

16:53.689 --> 16:56.734
And I admire your sense of teamwork.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.447
I didn't inspect that park. You did.
Keep that in mind on your way out there.

17:19.632 --> 17:21.759
You all right?

17:24.845 --> 17:28.223
It's chilly out here.
Why don't you go inside?

17:31.060 --> 17:33.604
Did you see it?

17:39.485 --> 17:41.904
How do you think it happened?

17:44.239 --> 17:46.784
It doesn't make sense.

17:49.328 --> 17:51.497
Better go home and get some sleep.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.294
Wayne was up there.
He was walking the track.

17:59.922 --> 18:03.425
Anything wrong, he would have found it.

18:03.592 --> 18:05.970
Who's Wayne?

18:07.471 --> 18:10.307
I've been here 40 years.

18:12.935 --> 18:16.105
Nothing like this ever happened before.

18:27.825 --> 18:30.494
Have you had any figures...

18:30.661 --> 18:33.080
We're not leaving until we get the story.

18:33.247 --> 18:37.918
- Harry.
- Hello, Burt. Tough break.

18:38.085 --> 18:42.423
You know the Rocket.
54 years and not a single accident.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.008
Until tonight.

18:44.174 --> 18:46.885
Tell me about it.
Harry, Lieutenant Keefer.

18:47.052 --> 18:50.556
This is George Spurling,
Dover Pacific Insurance.

18:50.723 --> 18:54.310
- Harry's with Standards and Safety.
- How are you?

18:54.476 --> 18:58.105
- Your department inspect this place?
- Every three months.

18:58.272 --> 19:00.316
So, what the hell happened?

19:00.482 --> 19:02.943
Good question.

19:05.654 --> 19:08.741
We pay a higher premium
on the merry-go-round.

19:08.907 --> 19:13.412
Anybody have any ideas? You're
the experts. If it was a malfunction...

19:13.579 --> 19:18.751
Last month we had both trains X-rayed
for metal fatigue. Clean bill of health.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.378
- Who are you?
- Wayne Moore. Head mechanic.

19:21.545 --> 19:24.214
Something may have happened
after the test.

19:24.381 --> 19:27.009
- I walk that track each day.
- Including today?

19:27.176 --> 19:30.971
Including today. One solid hour.
From 7:00 to 8:00.

19:32.056 --> 19:33.849
It's an act of God.

19:34.016 --> 19:37.686
When you put it back together
stress engineers will take a look.

19:37.853 --> 19:40.397
- Anybody want coffee?
- Black, please.

19:49.615 --> 19:53.702
- Burt, you open at noon, don't you?
- Mm-hm.

19:53.869 --> 19:57.748
I met a guy, old-timer, out there.
Carries a broom.

19:57.915 --> 20:00.834
- That's Benny.
- What time does he get to work?

20:01.001 --> 20:03.337
You're lucky if he wanders in by 10:00.

20:03.504 --> 20:06.840
He said he saw Wayne
up on the rollercoaster.

20:07.007 --> 20:08.217
So?

20:08.384 --> 20:10.636
If Wayne inspects from 7:00 to 8:00,

20:10.803 --> 20:13.472
what was he doing up there
two hours later?

20:13.639 --> 20:16.517
Were you up on the tracks
at 10:00 this morning?

20:16.684 --> 20:20.229
- No, I was home having breakfast.
- You finished at 8:00?

20:20.396 --> 20:22.731
8:00, maybe 8:15.

20:23.899 --> 20:25.693
Thanks.

20:25.859 --> 20:29.113
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Why doesn't it?

20:29.279 --> 20:32.533
Benny's been around
since the place opened,

20:32.700 --> 20:34.910
but he's not sure if it's day or night.

20:35.077 --> 20:38.080
- He drinks?
- No. But he's an old man.

20:38.247 --> 20:42.126
- Spends a lot of time talking to his wife.
- When did she die?

20:42.293 --> 20:44.586
He was never married.

20:46.046 --> 20:47.631
Forget I asked.

21:13.824 --> 21:18.454
It's a yellow Chevy Malibu.
It's right outside in stall six.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.498
- How long will you keep the car?
- Just a few hours.

21:21.665 --> 21:24.043
- Short trip.
- Just passing through.

22:12.508 --> 22:17.930
- Come back and see us again.
- I might. I like your cotton candy.

22:29.316 --> 22:31.402
- Harry?
- Hmm?

22:31.568 --> 22:35.990
If you're trying to kill us,
at least let me put on some lip gloss.

22:36.156 --> 22:39.535
I was thinking about
the first cigarette I ever smoked.

22:39.702 --> 22:42.830
It was a Camel. No filter.

22:44.915 --> 22:47.626
- You just passed the house.
- What?

22:47.793 --> 22:50.587
The house, remember?
Where you used to live?

22:50.754 --> 22:52.881
Oh, my God.

23:05.477 --> 23:08.856
When you stop smoking,
you're supposed to gain weight.

23:09.023 --> 23:11.442
I think you look cute...

23:13.527 --> 23:16.780
for someone going through male menopause.

23:32.713 --> 23:35.215
- Morning.
- Is she ready?

23:36.967 --> 23:39.011
Come on in.

23:39.178 --> 23:42.014
Tracy, your father's here.

23:44.433 --> 23:47.645
- Still dating Pam?
- Fran. She's outside.

23:50.773 --> 23:53.692
- You've met Dale?
- No, I don't think so.

23:53.859 --> 23:55.944
Hi.

23:56.111 --> 23:59.198
- When are you going to bring her back?
- Not late.

24:00.157 --> 24:04.036
Your hair is different.
Are you styling it?

24:04.203 --> 24:08.040
No. It's... I use a hot comb.

24:08.916 --> 24:10.960
Mmm...

24:11.752 --> 24:14.672
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, darling.

24:18.926 --> 24:21.512
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good time.

24:22.012 --> 24:25.849
Er... Nice meeting you, Dale.

24:28.519 --> 24:31.981
- How do you like the robe?
- It's fine, thanks. Yours?

24:32.147 --> 24:34.066
Birthday present.

24:39.029 --> 24:41.490
I hope you keep the bedroom door locked.

24:41.657 --> 24:43.575
That's more than we used to do.

24:43.742 --> 24:46.662
- That's because there was...
- Nothing going on.

25:00.592 --> 25:02.761
- Do they have names?
- No, not yet.

25:02.928 --> 25:05.306
Most of them are still babies.

25:05.472 --> 25:09.351
- Can I touch one?
- You should wait till you get him home.

25:09.518 --> 25:12.187
Helen, will you listen?

25:12.354 --> 25:15.441
Not a dog. Hamsters.

25:17.234 --> 25:22.072
How do I know if they're messy?
Look, it's your house, you decide.

25:24.116 --> 25:26.869
No, I'm not trying to make you the heavy.

25:29.246 --> 25:33.125
Yes, she seems like she likes them.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.836
OK, fine. See you.

25:36.003 --> 25:38.339
- What do they eat?
- Hamster food.

25:38.505 --> 25:41.467
They like spinach. Or carrots or alfalfa.

25:41.634 --> 25:44.470
- Your mother says OK.
- Can I have a pair?

25:44.637 --> 25:49.016
They don't stay a pair. You can't
dump hamsters on your mother.

25:50.601 --> 25:53.687
- Can I have the white one?
- The pretty one? Sure.

25:55.564 --> 25:59.026
- How are we gonna get him home?
- We have hamster caskets.

25:59.193 --> 26:01.654
A little box will be fine.

26:01.820 --> 26:06.158
When did you put this paper in here?
The one at the bottom of the cage.

26:06.325 --> 26:08.535
This morning. Every morning.

26:08.702 --> 26:11.830
- So it's today's paper?
- Yeah, should be.

26:15.334 --> 26:19.254
There was a fire on one of the rides.
We put it out. No one was hurt.

26:19.421 --> 26:22.091
I can't release any more information.

26:22.257 --> 26:25.010
Look, we had an accident
of our own last week.

26:25.177 --> 26:27.930
- I just want to ask a few questions.
- I'm sorry.

26:28.097 --> 26:31.475
- Who's covering this up? The police?
- I'd rather not say.

26:31.642 --> 26:35.729
- 'What the hell is it? A state secret?'
- Management.

26:35.896 --> 26:39.483
- Who's management?
- 'Susquehanna Development Company.

26:39.650 --> 26:42.736
- 'It's been a long day.'
- I'll call the chairman.

26:42.903 --> 26:46.615
He's in the book. Good night, Mr Calder.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.044
Daddy, Confucius say,
"With faith, man can move mountains."

26:59.211 --> 27:02.840
- I thought Jesus said that.
- According to that fortune cookie...

27:03.007 --> 27:05.676
- Which is yours.
- ...Confucius said it too.

27:05.843 --> 27:09.263
Don't believe everything you read.

27:09.430 --> 27:13.559
- Daddy's pissed off.
- Where did she learn that language?

27:23.402 --> 27:27.156
I did some checking. The park
in Pittsburgh never had a problem.

27:27.323 --> 27:29.783
- That's two accidents in a week.
- Coincidence.

27:29.950 --> 27:33.329
Maybe. I just talked to Burt Lyons
out at Ocean View.

27:33.495 --> 27:38.417
- He's got orders not to be helpful.
- They're trying to minimise publicity.

27:38.584 --> 27:40.961
- What's bugging you?
- I'm not sure.

27:41.128 --> 27:45.924
- You sending a man to Pittsburgh?
- 'I can't afford to send a man to lunch.

27:46.091 --> 27:51.096
'Calder, when you're sure about what
you're not sure about, call me back.'

27:51.263 --> 27:53.474
Yeah, thanks.

28:00.064 --> 28:03.525
Harry, your call to
Susquehanna Development.

28:03.692 --> 28:05.778
The president's name is Quinlan.

28:05.944 --> 28:10.532
He's on his way to Chicago but you can
reach him at the Hyatt Regency today.

28:12.076 --> 28:16.038
Jackie, find out who owns
Ocean View Park out here.

28:16.205 --> 28:18.749
- Get the head man for me.
- OK.

28:49.530 --> 28:51.365
I got that information.

28:51.532 --> 28:55.744
Ocean View is run by
the Leisure Time Corporation in Seattle.

28:55.911 --> 28:59.581
- Did you call the president?
- He's on his way to Chicago.

28:59.748 --> 29:02.756
- Hyatt Regency?
- Hyatt Regency.

29:09.842 --> 29:12.678
- You wanna go to Chicago?
- Five, Si.

29:12.845 --> 29:16.307
The presidents of five corporations
are on their way there,

29:16.473 --> 29:18.726
including Ocean View's and Wonderworld's.

29:18.892 --> 29:23.856
Maybe it's a convention. You think
something's out of line, call the police.

29:24.023 --> 29:30.279
The police didn't inspect that coaster.
I did. You rubbed my face in that.

29:32.323 --> 29:36.744
I hoped that divorce would curb
some of your more paranoid impulses.

29:36.910 --> 29:40.164
I'm going to Chicago
and you're paying for the trip.

29:41.248 --> 29:43.292
Out of the question.

29:44.376 --> 29:46.587
Funny how things pop into your mind.

29:46.754 --> 29:50.424
I've been thinking about
that medical building last year.

29:50.591 --> 29:53.802
- You bastard.
- Shame about that roof caving in.

29:53.969 --> 29:56.639
I wish you hadn't pulled me off
the inspection.

29:56.805 --> 29:59.183
I'm good at spotting
substandard materials.

29:59.350 --> 30:03.228
It was your nephew's
construction company, wasn't it?

30:03.395 --> 30:06.774
- How long will you be gone?
- A day or two.

30:06.940 --> 30:10.819
- Better go and get packed.
- Thanks a lot, Si.

30:10.986 --> 30:12.529
Harry.

30:14.281 --> 30:18.160
- You're a big disappointment to me.
- I feel bad about that, Si.

30:18.327 --> 30:20.829
You should have
moved up in the department.

30:20.996 --> 30:24.833
- District manager. Supervisor.
- You know me. No ambition.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.713
It's your mouth. You have a personality
problem. You never want to fit in.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.258
It depends on what you want fitted
and where you want it put, Si.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.971
Give my love to Sylvia.

31:12.840 --> 31:16.093
I appreciate you coming here
on such short notice.

31:16.260 --> 31:19.221
I'm sorry I couldn't be more specific,

31:19.388 --> 31:22.725
but a face-to-face meeting was necessary.

31:22.891 --> 31:26.937
This was delivered to me
by mail yesterday.

31:27.104 --> 31:31.191
I was instructed to play this for you
within a 24-hour period.

31:32.234 --> 31:35.639
That is why I told you
it was an emergency.

31:37.031 --> 31:38.991
Room service!

31:44.371 --> 31:47.207
- We didn't order any.
- Compliments of the hotel.

31:48.542 --> 31:51.128
All right. Put it here.

32:03.891 --> 32:06.352
- We can do that ourselves.
- Oh.

32:07.353 --> 32:10.981
I'll just straighten that out for you.
Thank you.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.422
- Yes?
- Mr Quinlan?

32:35.589 --> 32:38.801
- Who are you?
- Department of Standards and Safety.

32:42.638 --> 32:44.765
This isn't Chicago jurisdiction.

32:44.932 --> 32:47.810
No, sir, I just flew in.
I'd like to talk to you.

32:47.977 --> 32:51.188
I'm tied up at the moment.
Leave your number at the desk.

32:51.355 --> 32:54.066
I'm prepared to make a nuisance of myself.

32:54.233 --> 32:57.903
I have two dimes.
One for the police, one for the "Tribune".

32:58.070 --> 33:02.616
You can invite me in
or I can start making phone calls.

33:02.783 --> 33:07.329
I'm not your enemy, Mr Quinlan.
We may be on the same side.

33:09.081 --> 33:11.333
Come in.

33:14.461 --> 33:17.548
- Gentlemen, this is Mr...
- Calder.

33:17.715 --> 33:21.051
- Apparently he wants to talk to us.
- About what?

33:21.218 --> 33:23.220
- This.
- It's none of your business.

33:23.387 --> 33:26.265
Who runs
the Leisure Development Corporation?

33:26.432 --> 33:27.433
I do.

33:27.599 --> 33:30.853
I was the inspector
on your coaster at Ocean View Park.

33:31.020 --> 33:35.232
I don't think what happened was an
accident. Or the fire at Wonderworld.

33:35.399 --> 33:37.443
When are we gonna play that tape?

33:37.609 --> 33:40.696
- You don't mind his presence?
- Play it.

33:53.959 --> 33:56.337
'Thank you for coming, gentlemen.

33:56.503 --> 34:00.049
'Your companies are involved,
either through subsidiaries

34:00.215 --> 34:04.178
'or long-term lease arrangement
with the amusement park industry.

34:04.345 --> 34:08.223
'As you know, it's a peculiar business,
more vulnerable than most.

34:08.389 --> 34:12.811
'During the past week, I've given you
two examples of just how vulnerable.

34:12.978 --> 34:15.898
'I have no desire
to create further incidents,

34:16.065 --> 34:18.984
'assuming you agree to my proposal.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.445
'The payment will be $1 million,

34:21.612 --> 34:25.783
'to be delivered at a time
and a place of my choosing.

34:25.949 --> 34:30.036
'You'll be contacted
no later than a week from today.

34:30.204 --> 34:33.498
'You may wish to bring in the police.
That is up to you.

34:33.666 --> 34:37.168
'It will not hamper me in the slightest.
Thanks for your time.'

34:38.295 --> 34:42.007
- Jesus.
- Polite son of a bitch, isn't he?

34:42.174 --> 34:44.760
He can afford to be.
A million for starters.

34:44.927 --> 34:49.306
- And no guarantee it stops there.
- Well, what do we do?

34:49.473 --> 34:52.601
'We pay. We can't have
that bastard killing people.'

34:52.768 --> 34:55.980
'Oh, good. Nice to have
a humanitarian in the group.'

34:56.146 --> 34:58.357
'OK, it's not good for business, either.'

34:58.524 --> 35:01.193
- 'Thank you.'
- 'We gotta pay.'

35:01.360 --> 35:04.196
'Why cloud the issue with morality?'

35:04.363 --> 35:06.949
'Let's wait till he contacts us again.'

35:07.116 --> 35:10.411
- 'We could try and arrange a meeting.'
- 'Don't.'

35:10.577 --> 35:12.705
- 'Why not?'
- 'You're amateurs.'

35:12.871 --> 35:16.208
'What is he? The professional?
He's a psychopath.'

35:16.375 --> 35:20.337
- 'Whatever he is, he's smart.'
- 'We can do without the testimonials.'

35:20.504 --> 35:25.426
'Just don't underestimate him. He's
rigged two accidents 2,000 miles apart

35:25.592 --> 35:28.012
'in one week without leaving a trace.'

35:28.178 --> 35:31.140
That means knowledge
of structural engineering,

35:31.307 --> 35:33.434
'demolition and electronics.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.894
'He's not some nut with a bomb
on a plane.'

35:36.061 --> 35:39.356
'It all comes down to the same thing.
Extortion.'

35:39.523 --> 35:41.734
No argument.

35:42.818 --> 35:44.862
Mr Calder...

35:46.155 --> 35:49.575
- What do you suggest?
- Well, it's your money.

35:49.742 --> 35:52.119
But I'd get some expert advice
if I were you.

35:52.286 --> 35:55.289
It's a felony.
Call in the federal authorities.

36:37.748 --> 36:43.295
Are you Calder? My name's Hoyt.
Special agent in charge. Fill me in.

36:43.462 --> 36:47.132
- Anyone touch the tape?
- Just Quinlan.

36:47.299 --> 36:52.054
- Our friend would never leave prints.
- Do I have your guarantee of that?

36:52.221 --> 36:56.308
- It's obvious.
- We'll let our lab make a determination.

36:58.686 --> 37:01.480
We'll send that tape in
for voice analysis.

37:01.647 --> 37:05.776
If it was delivered to Quinlan,
see if he kept the wrapping.

37:05.943 --> 37:08.821
The suspect talked about
their gross earnings?

37:08.988 --> 37:12.408
- Yes.
- We're dealing with five corporations.

37:12.574 --> 37:17.997
I want to know if anyone owns shares
in all five. Maybe he reads the reports.

37:18.163 --> 37:20.332
We'll get him.

37:22.334 --> 37:26.213
I didn't make any reservations, man.
I thought you made them!

37:33.262 --> 37:35.556
- Where are they?
- Suite 2308.

37:35.723 --> 37:38.225
Fine. We'll take it from here.

37:38.392 --> 37:40.644
Mr Calder, we want to thank you.

37:40.811 --> 37:45.190
Contacting us was right. I only wish
more people would give us their trust.

37:45.357 --> 37:48.569
- Don't you want me to come up?
- No, that won't be necessary.

37:48.736 --> 37:51.864
I'm sure you want to be getting home.
Thanks again.

37:52.031 --> 37:55.701
Oh, you're with Standards and Safety,
aren't you?

37:55.868 --> 38:00.372
Prepare a letter of commendation
to the head of Mr Calder's department.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.000
Have a nice flight.

38:31.862 --> 38:35.115
I'd like to check out.
Could you prepare my bill?

38:47.086 --> 38:49.088
Damn.

39:05.729 --> 39:09.358
- Yeah.
- 'Hello. Is this Harry Calder?'

39:09.525 --> 39:11.986
That's right.

39:13.070 --> 39:17.741
- Hello?
- 'I think you're entitled to a vacation.'

39:18.993 --> 39:22.538
- Who is this?
- 'That's not really important.

39:22.705 --> 39:27.001
- 'Have you ever been to Virginia?'
- No, and I don't plan to. Who is this?

39:27.167 --> 39:31.755
'It's a little hot this time of year,
but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.'

39:42.224 --> 39:44.977
Go home and watch "Sesame Street".

40:06.290 --> 40:08.709
1F.

40:08.876 --> 40:11.170
Well, hello, Calder.

40:11.337 --> 40:13.922
I see you brought Donder and Blitzen.

40:14.089 --> 40:16.342
Let's talk.

40:18.469 --> 40:23.766
- You must be out of your mind.
- It has to be you. He was very definite.

40:23.932 --> 40:26.393
Why? I don't even know the son of a bitch.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.604
Apparently he knows you.

40:28.771 --> 40:31.732
- And he wants me to deliver the money?
- Yep.

40:31.899 --> 40:34.610
The drop is tomorrow. Kings Dominion Park.

40:34.777 --> 40:38.530
You're to wait by
a specified phone booth for his call.

40:38.697 --> 40:42.076
- Where is this place?
- Richmond, Virginia.

40:43.953 --> 40:47.957
- The son of a bitch just called me.
- What?

40:48.123 --> 40:52.169
Ten minutes ago. He said I deserved
a vacation and I'd like it in Virginia.

40:52.336 --> 40:54.380
Calder...

40:54.546 --> 40:59.969
Just what is this relationship
between you and our friend?

41:00.135 --> 41:03.514
- There isn't any relationship.
- There has to be.

41:03.681 --> 41:05.307
I said there isn't.

41:05.474 --> 41:10.688
Then I assume you'd
be... willing to take a polygraph test?

41:10.854 --> 41:14.149
You remind me of the man I work for.
I don't like him either.

41:14.316 --> 41:16.360
Really? He seemed nice enough to me.

41:16.527 --> 41:18.779
- You talked to him?
- Sure.

41:18.946 --> 41:22.282
You had to have
an official leave of absence.

41:22.449 --> 41:25.244
I don't want an official leave of absence.

41:25.411 --> 41:28.998
Yeah, that's what he said you'd say.

41:29.164 --> 41:31.375
Now listen.

41:31.542 --> 41:35.796
I don't know about you,
but I want this man put away.

41:35.963 --> 41:38.841
At the moment, it's not wise to cross him.

41:42.553 --> 41:45.389
Your plane leaves in three hours.

41:48.809 --> 41:51.854
I can always use another
letter of commendation.

42:13.208 --> 42:16.045
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Harry.'

42:16.211 --> 42:19.590
- What do you want?
- 'Take a sweater. It gets chilly.'

42:19.757 --> 42:22.551
I don't know why
you're dragging me into this.

42:22.718 --> 42:25.095
- I trust you.
- 'You don't know me.'

42:25.262 --> 42:29.892
'You were the only one in that room
who appreciated what I was doing.'

42:30.059 --> 42:32.269
What room?

42:32.436 --> 42:35.898
- You bugged that hotel room!
- Of course.

42:36.065 --> 42:39.485
You told them not to underestimate me.
That was good advice.

42:39.652 --> 42:44.823
Get this straight. I said you're smart,
but I'm not a fan, OK? You kill people.

42:44.990 --> 42:48.702
'Do you think they would have
paid attention if I hadn't?'

42:48.869 --> 42:52.331
- Is this about attention?
- It's about money, Harry.

42:52.498 --> 42:54.541
Then get a job.

42:54.708 --> 42:57.503
'I've had jobs.
I'm not particularly productive.'

42:57.670 --> 42:59.505
Am I having this conversation?

42:59.672 --> 43:02.716
'You're unsympathetic.
I'm trying to communicate.'

43:02.883 --> 43:06.387
Fine. Name a place
and we'll have a coffee.

43:06.553 --> 43:08.597
I'm not at my best over the phone.

43:10.140 --> 43:13.560
- What do you think of Hoyt?
- Says he's going to get you.

43:13.727 --> 43:18.607
No one's gonna get me.
But I'll promise you this, Harry.

43:18.774 --> 43:23.612
If they pay me, and if they do what I say,
I'll never bother them again.

43:23.779 --> 43:25.280
Maybe you enjoy it.

43:25.447 --> 43:28.951
Wrong psychological profile.
I'm not in this for kicks.

43:29.118 --> 43:32.162
Oh, yeah, it's only the money.
You're a businessman.

43:32.329 --> 43:35.291
In a corrupt society
you're no worse than anybody else.

43:35.457 --> 43:37.459
We all cheat on our taxes.

43:37.626 --> 43:41.964
- I'm not enjoying this conversation.
- Then get another messenger boy.

44:12.286 --> 44:16.457
- Yes?
- I may have made a mistake with you.

44:16.624 --> 44:20.336
We'll see.
Go to Richmond and do as you're told.

45:11.303 --> 45:14.348
- A description would help.
- We don't have one.

45:14.515 --> 45:20.145
- I hope you don't expect trouble.
- It's a drop. He'll behave himself.

45:25.150 --> 45:27.194
Why did he pick this place?

45:27.361 --> 45:31.699
It's noisy, crowded and hell to cover.
But we have one advantage.

45:31.865 --> 45:33.909
- What's that?
- Calder.

45:34.785 --> 45:36.620
Thanks a lot.

45:36.787 --> 45:39.999
This is the telephone booth.

45:40.165 --> 45:44.253
We're instructed to have Calder
waiting outside at 11:30 sharp.

45:44.420 --> 45:47.464
I want an "Out of Order" sign
on that booth.

45:48.924 --> 45:53.595
Our friend will contact you by phone
to tell you where to take the money.

45:53.762 --> 45:56.473
Do exactly what he says.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.476
It's in our interests
to expedite the delivery.

45:59.643 --> 46:01.395
Why?

46:01.562 --> 46:07.234
Because somewhere, at some point,
he has to get his hands on that money.

46:07.401 --> 46:12.239
It's his moment of maximum risk.
There's no way he can avoid it.

46:12.406 --> 46:15.367
But whatever he does,
we'll have our shot at him.

46:15.534 --> 46:18.621
If it's picked up by a third party,
we follow it.

46:18.787 --> 46:21.540
If he comes himself, we move in.

46:22.791 --> 46:28.047
We can't stake out the entire park
but we can cover you. And the money.

46:28.213 --> 46:32.635
- Don't you think he knows that?
- Course he does. Where's the bag?

46:34.345 --> 46:38.641
That arrived yesterday.
We're to fill it with unmarked bills.

46:38.807 --> 46:42.978
50s and 100s.
And Calder is to have it with him.

46:43.145 --> 46:45.689
- I don't follow.
- He's protecting himself.

46:45.856 --> 46:49.610
There's nothing unusual about the bag
except it's easy to spot.

46:49.777 --> 46:53.322
- A switch?
- Very good, Calder.

46:53.489 --> 46:57.117
Glad everybody understands.
Can you explain it to me?

46:57.284 --> 46:59.411
Run Calder and us all over the park.

46:59.578 --> 47:03.707
At one particular spot,
he'll have a duplicate suitcase waiting.

47:03.874 --> 47:08.295
He gets word to me to make a switch,
and I walk off with the empty suitcase.

47:08.462 --> 47:12.174
While you're following me,
he picks up the one with the money.

47:12.341 --> 47:14.385
Don't say, "Very good."

47:14.551 --> 47:19.098
What do we do? He can tell Calder to
make the switch in a thousand places.

47:19.264 --> 47:21.558
- How will we know?
- Tom?

47:23.769 --> 47:25.813
Calder will wear that radio.

47:25.980 --> 47:30.025
When he wants to alert us,
he just opens his mouth.

47:32.444 --> 47:34.279
So what's gonna go wrong?

48:16.614 --> 48:19.158
There you are, honey.

48:19.325 --> 48:21.660
Don't you dare put that in your mouth!

48:26.707 --> 48:28.792
I got him in view.

48:44.266 --> 48:48.646
- Everyone at their stations?
- Yes, sir. I just ran a check.

48:52.358 --> 48:56.820
- Pierce, do you read me?
- 10-4. All exits covered by security.

48:56.987 --> 48:58.572
Right.

49:00.449 --> 49:04.370
- Calder's mike open?
- That's him breathing now.

49:06.372 --> 49:08.874
- Phone booth?
- We're tapped in.

49:25.432 --> 49:27.601
11:30.

49:32.773 --> 49:35.025
- Start the trace.
- Start.

49:35.192 --> 49:37.987
- Yes?
- 'Good morning, Harry.

49:38.153 --> 49:40.364
- 'Sleep well?'
- Get on with it.

49:40.531 --> 49:44.076
'There's a stand near
the Mason-Dixon Music Hall.

49:44.243 --> 49:49.248
'They sell hats. I want you to buy one.
Have your name stitched on the brim.

49:49.415 --> 49:52.751
'And then you'll like this, Harry.
I want you to put it on.'

49:53.877 --> 49:58.382
- And then?
- 'Just wait. You'll be contacted.'

49:58.549 --> 50:01.051
What stand was that? The Mason-Dixon Line?

50:01.218 --> 50:05.139
'Don't bother stalling.
There isn't time to trace this call.

50:06.807 --> 50:09.893
'Two other things. First...

50:10.060 --> 50:14.106
'When you leave the toadstool,
take off the microphone.'

50:15.149 --> 50:19.028
- What microphone?
- 'Take it off, Harry.'

50:19.194 --> 50:23.657
'I'll be watching. I don't want you
in voice contact with anyone.

50:23.824 --> 50:27.953
'And if you have a second one, I'll know.
Do you have a second one?'

50:28.120 --> 50:31.373
- No, I don't.
- 'You know something?

50:31.540 --> 50:34.793
- 'I believe you, Harry.'
- Is that it?

50:34.960 --> 50:38.255
'I said there were two things.

50:38.422 --> 50:41.050
'I have a little surprise for everybody.

50:41.216 --> 50:46.013
'Are you listening, Mr Hoyt?
There's a bomb in the park.

50:46.180 --> 50:48.807
- 'Please follow my instructions... '
- Go ahead.

50:48.974 --> 50:50.684
'... or I'll set it off.

50:54.229 --> 50:56.398
'Now go get your funny hat, Harry.'

50:56.565 --> 50:58.692
- Any luck?
- No.

51:00.402 --> 51:02.196
Damn.

51:03.447 --> 51:07.660
What about the bomb? Is he lying?

51:08.786 --> 51:10.704
I doubt it.

51:13.582 --> 51:16.251
Go to the service gates.
And park out of sight.

51:16.418 --> 51:19.505
Kings Dominion?
I was there last week with my kids!

52:01.297 --> 52:04.466
If you make a switch,
take off your sunglasses.

52:16.437 --> 52:18.981
There you are, sir. That will be $3.50.

52:24.612 --> 52:26.905
We don't get many "Harrys" around here.

52:27.072 --> 52:29.533
A lot of Jasons and Scotts.

52:50.512 --> 52:53.724
- What's he doing?
- 'Just standing there.'

52:58.479 --> 53:01.690
He has to tell Calder
where to make the switch.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.904
How's he gonna do it? Sky writing?

53:22.086 --> 53:24.755
George? Anything to report?

53:24.922 --> 53:29.426
No, sir, just about 30,000 cases
of sunburn. I'll keep my eyes open.

54:21.061 --> 54:24.440
Excuse me. Mr Calder? Mr Harry Calder?

54:24.606 --> 54:26.859
- Yes.
- Package for you.

54:37.953 --> 54:39.330
Thank you.

54:39.496 --> 54:42.541
Young man, give that to me.
Police officer.

55:32.508 --> 55:35.010
- What did he look like?
- I never saw the guy.

55:35.177 --> 55:38.555
You can check. Red Line Delivery.
Came in the mail with $100.

55:38.722 --> 55:41.183
- Written instructions?
- No. He called us.

55:42.601 --> 55:45.145
It's a radio. He's to go to the Vertigo.

55:45.312 --> 55:47.231
Can you pick him up?

55:47.398 --> 55:50.901
- He'll probably use a banded frequency.
- Well, try.

56:26.395 --> 56:28.731
Harry?

56:28.897 --> 56:31.942
If you read me, speak into the grid.

56:33.819 --> 56:35.863
- I read you.
- He made contact.

56:36.030 --> 56:39.908
- You've got to pick up that signal!
- It's an illegal band. I can't.

56:40.075 --> 56:42.036
Well, keep at it.

56:42.202 --> 56:44.163
- 'Am I breaking up?'
- A little.

56:44.330 --> 56:49.501
Adjust the squelch button.
One... two... three...

56:50.586 --> 56:53.297
four... five...

56:53.464 --> 56:56.133
six... Is that better?

56:56.300 --> 56:58.427
Better. What next?

56:58.594 --> 57:02.681
- 'Get on the ride, please.'
- Can't we simplify this?

57:04.141 --> 57:06.977
Have to keep you moving. Sorry, Harry.

57:07.144 --> 57:11.023
Just try to enjoy yourself.
Have a good time.

57:23.160 --> 57:26.830
- 'He's getting on the Vertigo.'
- Come on, pal.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.965
Headed your way, Tom.

57:38.425 --> 57:40.636
You have to leave your suitcase.

57:40.803 --> 57:43.389
- You want to let him on with that?
- OK. Go ahead.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.756
'The river on your right
is the Zambezi River.

58:17.923 --> 58:21.927
'In Africa it is known
for its huge hippo population.

58:22.094 --> 58:27.141
'If you look at the pond to your right,
you may see our baby hippo.

58:27.308 --> 58:32.688
'Baby hippos are born under water and
immediately go to the surface for air.

58:32.855 --> 58:36.442
'The gestation period for a hippo
is about 24 months.

58:36.608 --> 58:41.905
'To the left of the train, you'll catch
a glimpse of our white rhino and zebra... '

58:42.072 --> 58:44.867
'Having a good time, Harry?'

58:45.034 --> 58:49.622
'You are now entering the Kanha
preserve, home of the Bengal tiger.

58:49.788 --> 58:53.667
'The tigers you will see
have all been born in captivity.'

58:53.834 --> 58:57.129
Congratulations.
You just won a carton of cigarettes.

58:57.296 --> 58:59.673
I don't smoke.

59:01.342 --> 59:03.802
He's moving again.

59:03.969 --> 59:07.556
- He's heading for the rollercoaster.
- 'Jesus Christ.'

59:23.781 --> 59:27.576
Hey, I bet you a million dollars
we beat you, mister!

59:43.050 --> 59:45.928
Get a move on, you guys. Come on!

01:01:03.547 --> 01:01:09.011
'Having fun on the coaster, Harry?
Ride it again.'

01:01:09.178 --> 01:01:12.139
'He's riding the son of a bitch again.'

01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:56.934
- Here's your photograph.
- What photograph?

01:01:57.101 --> 01:02:01.188
Man on the phone said, "Take a picture
of the man with the dark glasses."

01:02:01.355 --> 01:02:04.900
- That'll be $2.50.
- I'll take that. What did the man say?

01:02:05.067 --> 01:02:08.529
- What?
- The caller. What did he tell you to do?

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.802
'Harry? Why don't you get weighed?'

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:36.765
Sir, your suitcase.

01:02:44.106 --> 01:02:47.735
Sorry, sir, I thought you were thinner.
Take a prize.

01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:50.446
- Do I have to?
- No, sir.

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:57.578
Don't you want me to guess your age?

01:02:57.745 --> 01:03:00.748
- No.
- Step right up here.

01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:07.129
I'll say you weigh 210 pounds. Go ahead
and step right up on the scales.

01:03:07.296 --> 01:03:10.841
The subject's still moving.
He's on his way to the Skyride.

01:03:11.008 --> 01:03:14.928
- He's trying to wear us down.
- He's doing a damn good job.

01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:56.512
Where from here?
The Jack And The Beanstalk ride?

01:03:56.679 --> 01:04:00.432
'As a matter of fact,
this is almost the end of the line.'

01:04:02.476 --> 01:04:06.730
- What do you want me to do?
- 'I should tell you about the bomb.

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:10.985
- 'Would you like to know where it is?'
- Sure.

01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:13.195
'You're holding it.'

01:04:18.158 --> 01:04:20.744
- You bastard.
- 'Now, Harry.

01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:24.248
'It was activated when you turned it on,
so be careful.

01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:28.627
'I wouldn't want to lose you.
And don't throw it, Harry.

01:04:28.794 --> 01:04:31.839
'It will explode on impact.

01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:48.272
'Don't try to open it.
There's a tamper switch.

01:04:48.439 --> 01:04:54.445
'And don't leave it behind. I want to see
it in your hand when you get off.

01:04:54.612 --> 01:04:56.488
'OK, Harry?

01:04:57.823 --> 01:05:01.744
- 'Now, do I have your full attention?'
- Screw you.

<i>Hello to Yogi, hello to Boo Boo</i>

01:05:05.664 --> 01:05:08.709
<i>Hello to Scooby Doo...</i>

01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:17.259
'When you leave the car,
I want you to give the signal.'

01:05:17.426 --> 01:05:19.345
What signal?

01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:24.266
'The signal that tells them
you've switched suitcases.'

01:05:24.433 --> 01:05:26.852
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:27.019 --> 01:05:30.064
'Harry, I have the transmitter
in my pocket.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.691
'You know what happens
if I push the button.'

01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:36.111
How can I signal anybody?
You made me take off the mike.

01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:38.989
'They gave you a backup. I was watching.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.958
'One more thing.

01:05:49.124 --> 01:05:53.337
'If they don't move in immediately,
I'll know you didn't give the signal.

01:05:53.504 --> 01:05:55.631
'That means I'll push the button.

01:05:55.798 --> 01:06:00.552
'So please, Harry, for everybody's sake,
be convincing.'

01:06:08.978 --> 01:06:10.646
<i>Hello to Yogi</i>

01:06:10.813 --> 01:06:12.439
<i>Hello to Boo Boo...</i>

01:06:32.001 --> 01:06:35.129
- He just gave the signal.
- Who's boarding?

01:06:35.296 --> 01:06:38.090
- What?
- The car Calder got out of.

01:06:38.257 --> 01:06:40.509
Who's getting in?

01:06:42.594 --> 01:06:46.473
- Sorry, sir, I wasn't watching.
- What's your name?

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.268
- Lansing, sir.
- One of yours.

01:06:49.435 --> 01:06:52.187
- Patch me through to everybody.
- Done.

01:06:52.354 --> 01:06:56.317
All units, converge on Skyway platform,
south side of park.

01:06:56.483 --> 01:07:00.029
Use extreme caution.
Subject may be armed. Let's go.

01:07:14.877 --> 01:07:16.712
Hey!

01:07:27.473 --> 01:07:30.559
Federal law. You see that car
coming in? The red one?

01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:32.686
When it docks, stop the machinery.

01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:35.189
- I can't.
- Don't argue. Clear the platform.

01:07:35.356 --> 01:07:39.026
Dennis, prepare to stop the ride!

01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:41.904
Get 'em down!

01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:24.071
'Stop, Harry.

01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:27.032
'Turn around.

01:08:33.162 --> 01:08:35.457
'Do you see that bench on your left?'

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:41.546
- Yes.
- 'Walk over to it.

01:08:54.184 --> 01:08:56.729
'Put the suitcase on the bench.

01:09:01.817 --> 01:09:03.861
'Turn to the right.

01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:11.285
'Now walk away, Harry. Don't look back.'

01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:17.291
- What shall I do with the bomb?
- 'Give it to the bomb squad.

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:20.169
'They'll know how to handle it.
Start walking.

01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:22.462
'Remember, eyes front.

01:09:23.796 --> 01:09:25.633
'And, Harry...

01:09:26.716 --> 01:09:28.761
'Thanks for your cooperation.'

01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:38.687
Is this far enough?

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:44.401
Are we finished now?

01:09:45.986 --> 01:09:47.613
Hello?

01:10:08.217 --> 01:10:10.177
You could have alerted us!

01:10:10.344 --> 01:10:12.471
I was carrying a goddamn bomb.

01:10:12.638 --> 01:10:16.642
You weren't paralysed. All you had
to do was get a message to my men.

01:10:16.809 --> 01:10:20.938
What men? You pulled them all off me,
you stupid son of a bitch.

01:10:21.105 --> 01:10:24.650
I had you surrounded! Just one word.

01:10:24.817 --> 01:10:26.860
One move.

01:10:28.904 --> 01:10:32.616
That's why he picked you.
You can't think under pressure.

01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:35.744
Bring it in, boys.

01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:40.082
Well?

01:10:40.249 --> 01:10:43.752
It's plastic explosive,
rigged to go off by a radio signal.

01:10:43.919 --> 01:10:46.046
It's a beautiful piece of work.

01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:49.800
- Get a make on the components.
- You can buy them in any store.

01:10:49.967 --> 01:10:54.804
- You can't buy explosives in any store.
- No, but this stuff is home-made.

01:10:57.558 --> 01:11:01.770
Administration. Maintenance
vehicle leaving by the service exit.

01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:05.608
- Have it searched.
- Give it a once over.

01:11:13.866 --> 01:11:17.786
- Is something funny?
- He has a way to get it out of here.

01:11:18.662 --> 01:11:23.876
You know, I'm getting damn tired
of your misplaced admiration.

01:11:24.043 --> 01:11:26.170
Then drive me to the airport.

01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:30.507
Gladly. Make the arrangements.

01:11:33.218 --> 01:11:34.637
Calder.

01:11:35.888 --> 01:11:39.016
If your friend does get the money out,

01:11:39.183 --> 01:11:42.102
it just might be a terminal error.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.940
Why?

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.196
- You marked the money.
- So what?

01:11:52.363 --> 01:11:56.617
- He said he wanted unmarked bills.
- I don't give a damn what he said.

01:11:56.784 --> 01:11:58.577
It's done all the time.

01:11:58.744 --> 01:12:01.914
When he starts to pass the money,
we can get a fix.

01:12:02.081 --> 01:12:03.874
- He'll know.
- He won't.

01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:08.045
I put my ass on the line for nothing!
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:11.924
It wasn't necessary.

01:12:13.008 --> 01:12:15.719
I don't know who the hell I trust less.

01:12:15.886 --> 01:12:18.973
Him or you.

01:13:47.478 --> 01:13:53.859
'I gave them my terms and they're
in default and I'm very disappointed.'

01:13:54.026 --> 01:13:57.321
- What happened?
- 'You know exactly what happened.

01:13:57.488 --> 01:14:00.115
'Every one of those bills is marked.'

01:14:00.282 --> 01:14:02.576
How can you be sure? It may be a mistake.

01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:07.706
'Pixie dust, Harry.
It shows up under ultraviolet light.'

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.920
- They didn't tell me.
- 'I don't believe you, Harry.'

01:14:13.087 --> 01:14:15.923
I don't give a damn. They didn't tell me.

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:18.676
'I'll give them another demonstration.'

01:14:18.842 --> 01:14:22.680
You proved your point, OK?
You're smarter than they are.

01:14:22.846 --> 01:14:27.601
- I'll make calls. I'll get you your money.
- 'That's not good business.'

01:14:27.768 --> 01:14:31.397
Why make innocent people suffer?
Just give me some time.

01:14:31.563 --> 01:14:34.400
I promise they won't
screw around with you.

01:14:34.566 --> 01:14:37.152
'It's too late for negotiations, Harry.

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:39.822
- 'I won't be calling again.'
- Listen...

01:14:39.989 --> 01:14:43.033
'Tell your friends
I'll give them another reminder

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.796
'of how vulnerable they are.'

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:53.085
- Who was that?
- 'Operator.'

01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:56.588
Operator, what's the area code
for Washington DC?

01:14:56.755 --> 01:14:59.008
'202.'

01:15:06.307 --> 01:15:10.769
- Would you make us some coffee?
- No, I will not make us some coffee.

01:15:10.936 --> 01:15:13.230
Harry, what's going on?

01:15:13.397 --> 01:15:16.233
- 'Vice 702.'
- Special Agent Hoyt, please.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.277
- 'This is?'
- Harry Calder.

01:15:18.444 --> 01:15:20.571
- 'Harry Calder?'
- It's urgent.

01:15:20.738 --> 01:15:23.866
'Mr Hoyt will be changing planes
in Denver at 10:15.'

01:15:24.033 --> 01:15:25.868
Thank you.

01:15:42.009 --> 01:15:44.219
She's finished.

01:15:44.386 --> 01:15:47.931
- Hmm?
- Your daughter. Remember her?

01:15:48.098 --> 01:15:49.558
Oh!

01:15:49.725 --> 01:15:52.686
- Hey, where are you today?
- Sorry. Thinking.

01:15:52.853 --> 01:15:55.189
I noticed.

01:15:59.026 --> 01:16:03.113
- You're scaring the horses!
- You unpatriotic or something?

01:16:07.326 --> 01:16:09.787
- Tracy, that was terrific!
- Thank you.

01:16:09.954 --> 01:16:13.415
- Can we get something to eat?
- What do you feel like?

01:16:13.582 --> 01:16:16.543
- An enchilada?
- How about chilli?

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:18.921
Chilli's fine.

01:16:19.088 --> 01:16:23.926
Why don't you two have some
ice cream? I have to make a phone call.

01:16:24.093 --> 01:16:26.095
This is getting to be a habit.

01:16:27.513 --> 01:16:30.975
Next week I'll take a few days off,
we'll drive to San Diego.

01:16:31.141 --> 01:16:33.352
- We can go to the zoo or...
- Promise?

01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:37.147
If I don't, you can trade me in, OK?

01:16:37.314 --> 01:16:39.608
- Get me one too.
- OK.

01:16:45.656 --> 01:16:49.159
Would you empty your pockets
of all metal, please?

01:16:49.326 --> 01:16:54.248
'Mr Thomas Hoyt, flight 405,
please pick up a red courtesy phone.'

01:17:02.923 --> 01:17:06.302
- Mr Hoyt. You have a call for me?
- 'Yes, sir.'

01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:08.637
- Hello?
- 'Hoyt, this is Calder.

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:11.181
'I must see you. I may have something.'

01:17:11.348 --> 01:17:15.352
If you want me to miss my plane,
"may" is not good enough.

01:17:15.519 --> 01:17:18.814
"'May" is all you got.
See you in my office.'

01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:29.283
For Christ's sake, don't tell me you had
me come all the way out here for this.

01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:34.705
The first ride's today. In four hours.
TV coverage, a rock concert, reporters...

01:17:34.872 --> 01:17:38.334
We checked it out.
It's one of three dozen possibilities.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.712
- He's gonna hit it.
- Really? That's very interesting.

01:17:41.879 --> 01:17:44.423
Do you have anything in the way of proof?

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.384
I'm telling you, I know this guy.
He loves machinery.

01:17:47.551 --> 01:17:49.678
This is too tempting to pass up.

01:17:49.845 --> 01:17:53.641
He started with a roller coaster.
Why not take out the biggest of all?

01:17:53.807 --> 01:17:58.812
Let me show you something.
Complete breakdown for the summer.

01:17:58.979 --> 01:18:01.315
Fourth of July events schedule.

01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:04.193
"Rodeo at Wild West Park in Dallas.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.447
"Enchanted Castle opening today
at Funland in Wisconsin.

01:18:08.614 --> 01:18:11.742
"Beauty Contest at
Sky's The Limit in Detroit."

01:18:11.909 --> 01:18:16.747
Go ahead. Read it. Every fish fry in
America doing it up for the Fourth.

01:18:16.914 --> 01:18:20.626
Parades, air shows, belly dancers.

01:18:20.793 --> 01:18:24.088
There are 50 events on that list,
and you're down to one.

01:18:24.254 --> 01:18:27.883
- That's quite a trick.
- He's extorting five companies.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:30.761
They own less than a third of those parks.

01:18:30.928 --> 01:18:33.013
It's still too many to cover.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.600
How many are getting this publicity?
It's made to order.

01:18:36.767 --> 01:18:37.977
You're reaching.

01:18:38.143 --> 01:18:41.981
Confucius say,
"With faith, man can move mountains."

01:18:43.148 --> 01:18:46.151
Where did you get that?
Out of a fortune cookie?

01:18:46.318 --> 01:18:48.570
All right. Try this on for size.

01:18:48.737 --> 01:18:51.156
- I dug these out of the files.
- They are?

01:18:51.323 --> 01:18:55.327
Standards and Safety permits
for the Magic Mountain coaster.

01:18:55.494 --> 01:18:59.290
Read the name of the field inspector.
Under the authorisation.

01:18:59.456 --> 01:19:03.043
"Approved, H Calder." You inspected it?

01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:05.921
Three months ago.
It's been in the back of my mind.

01:19:06.088 --> 01:19:08.757
And those permits are public record.

01:19:08.924 --> 01:19:12.344
You're suggesting
he'll tear down that rollercoaster

01:19:12.511 --> 01:19:14.555
just because you said it was safe?

01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:19.268
I'm not his buddy now. He gets back
at me and dumps on the rest of you.

01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:21.478
That's bargain basement Freud.

01:19:21.645 --> 01:19:24.356
It's the perfect target
on the perfect day.

01:19:24.523 --> 01:19:27.860
Calder, you're asking me to make
a total commitment

01:19:28.027 --> 01:19:31.322
of men and money on the basis of a hunch.

01:19:31.488 --> 01:19:34.366
Nah, I can't do it. I'm sorry.

01:19:37.161 --> 01:19:39.288
I'll see you.

01:19:45.294 --> 01:19:48.339
- If you get any other ideas, let me know.
- Sure.

01:20:01.185 --> 01:20:04.521
- Hello?
- Me. I'm gonna be tied up for a while.

01:20:04.688 --> 01:20:08.275
- 'Can you take Tracy home?'
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:20:08.442 --> 01:20:12.196
- Where are you?
- I have to go to Magic Mountain.

01:20:12.363 --> 01:20:15.324
- 'It's business.'
- Magic Mountain.

01:20:15.491 --> 01:20:18.702
I'll tell you about it tonight, OK?

01:20:20.496 --> 01:20:22.706
- Can we go?
- Go where?

01:20:22.873 --> 01:20:25.042
Magic Mountain.

01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:29.755
- Your father doesn't want us there.
- It's something to do.

01:20:44.853 --> 01:20:48.190
- Get in.
- I'm parked in a red zone.

01:20:48.357 --> 01:20:51.443
If you're right about today,
we'll get it fixed.

01:22:38.759 --> 01:22:42.930
- We thought we'd lost you.
- Sorry. The files were locked.

01:22:45.015 --> 01:22:47.142
That's all.

01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:55.401
- What do you think?
- I'm an inspector, not an engineer.

01:22:55.567 --> 01:22:58.279
So think like a bomber.

01:23:12.167 --> 01:23:15.796
He'd want momentum, maximum speed.

01:23:15.963 --> 01:23:18.465
Probably coming off the loop.

01:23:18.632 --> 01:23:22.845
Somewhere between here and here.
If it's there at all.

01:23:25.055 --> 01:23:28.976
- I'll send the bomb squad up.
- We got a problem.

01:23:29.143 --> 01:23:33.480
If he's planted a bomb,
what happens if he sees them?

01:23:33.647 --> 01:23:36.609
He can blow them all over the park.

01:23:36.775 --> 01:23:39.111
Let's not take any chances.

01:23:39.278 --> 01:23:41.363
Clear everybody out, then we'll search.

01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:46.327
Over my dead body. For all you know,
this guy's 3,000 miles away.

01:23:46.493 --> 01:23:48.871
If he isn't he'll hit us tomorrow.

01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:51.206
You expect us to close permanently?

01:23:51.373 --> 01:23:54.043
There may be a way to work this.

01:23:54.209 --> 01:23:56.962
Let's say he's here. Where would he be?

01:23:57.129 --> 01:23:59.006
Who knows? Anywhere.

01:23:59.173 --> 01:24:01.383
The ride doesn't start for an hour

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:05.387
and the rollercoaster only
becomes important to him at 4:00.

01:24:05.554 --> 01:24:09.266
- Meaning?
- If he's not there, there's no danger.

01:24:09.433 --> 01:24:11.878
Put your men in maintenance clothes.
Nobody will notice them.

01:24:11.985 --> 01:24:13.836
It's still a risk.

01:24:17.691 --> 01:24:21.403
- If they're not willing, we'll forget it.
- I'll see what they say.

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:25.407
Wait a minute.
What about that crowd out there?

01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:28.661
- They're gonna get nervous.
- Got any bunting?

01:24:28.827 --> 01:24:32.039
- What?
- Bunting. Streamers. Decoration.

01:24:32.206 --> 01:24:36.043
They could be wrapping it around
the rails. It's the Fourth of July.

01:24:38.712 --> 01:24:42.466
- Always thinking, aren't you?
- So is he.

01:24:53.269 --> 01:24:55.396
65 minutes till zero hour.

01:24:55.562 --> 01:24:59.066
'All you lucky first-ride
ticket holders, hang on to them.

01:24:59.233 --> 01:25:03.362
'The Great American Revolution
blasts off at 4:00 on the button,

01:25:03.529 --> 01:25:05.239
'for the first time ever.'

01:25:05.406 --> 01:25:09.118
We're proud to present one
of the hottest acts in the country.

01:25:09.285 --> 01:25:12.079
Let's hear it for Sparks!

01:25:27.386 --> 01:25:29.680
I'll check out the cars.

01:26:45.506 --> 01:26:49.760
Hey, look up on the platform.
Isn't that a dog up there?

01:26:49.927 --> 01:26:55.432
- Dogs on the platform?! You're high.
- I'm not that high.

01:28:08.088 --> 01:28:09.590
All right.

01:28:10.507 --> 01:28:12.885
- The mayor is on his way.
- Swell.

01:28:13.052 --> 01:28:15.471
- Getting something.
- This is Hoyt.

01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:20.059
We checked out the cars.
Nothing under the seats or the frame.

01:28:20.225 --> 01:28:22.519
Thanks.

01:28:23.395 --> 01:28:26.398
I think he is at Coney Island.

01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:38.577
- Can I bum a cigarette?
- I'm out.

01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:56.428
One... two... three...!

01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:12.111
- Did you find anything?
- No.

01:29:12.278 --> 01:29:16.824
In five minutes we have to radio in.
There won't be enough time.

01:29:48.272 --> 01:29:50.774
There it is.

01:29:54.612 --> 01:29:55.654
Hey!

01:30:03.787 --> 01:30:07.541
'We found the bomb.
It's on the bridge after the tunnel.'

01:30:07.708 --> 01:30:10.377
- You'll bring it down?
- 'No. Don't wanna jar it.'

01:30:10.544 --> 01:30:14.965
- We're gonna take it apart here.
- For God's sake, be careful.

01:30:15.132 --> 01:30:18.093
If we're not, you'll be the first to know.

01:30:20.596 --> 01:30:23.015
He's not at Coney Island.

01:30:58.759 --> 01:31:01.178
No timer.

01:31:14.275 --> 01:31:18.487
Demerest. Yes? Terrific.

01:31:18.654 --> 01:31:21.740
The mayor has just arrived. What do I say?

01:31:22.992 --> 01:31:26.704
Ask him if he has any cigarettes.

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:52.980
It's your last cotton candy.
Do you understand? Don't ask me again.

01:31:53.147 --> 01:31:56.567
If you ask you're
going to get an absolute no.

01:32:28.766 --> 01:32:31.435
Keep wrapping that stuff.

01:34:39.605 --> 01:34:43.484
- I wish they'd give us a progress report.
- Maybe they're busy.

01:34:43.651 --> 01:34:46.570
It doesn't look like he rigged any traps.

01:34:46.737 --> 01:34:49.823
He didn't expect us to find it.
All right, move back.

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:53.619
Excuse me.
My wife would like to ask you something.

01:34:53.786 --> 01:34:57.957
All our pictures are of me and the kids
cos Walter always takes them.

01:34:58.123 --> 01:35:00.834
Could you take a picture
with my husband in it?

01:35:01.001 --> 01:35:03.045
- Sure.
- Thanks very much.

01:35:03.212 --> 01:35:06.674
- All you have to do is...
- I know how to work it.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.094
Come on, kids. Here we are.

01:35:19.645 --> 01:35:22.439
My wife shot a roll of film
but she cut off the heads.

01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:24.650
I did not cut them all off!

01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:28.195
- The others were out of focus.
- Will you be quiet?

01:35:28.362 --> 01:35:32.199
If I'm gonna be in the picture
I want to be in focus...

01:35:32.366 --> 01:35:36.495
- Young man, take the picture.
- Yes. You're the photographer.

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:46.297
Thanks very much. I have a terrible
feeling he cut off my head.

01:36:25.419 --> 01:36:28.547
'How about it? Weren't they fantastic?

01:36:28.714 --> 01:36:32.426
'Did you like what you heard?

01:36:32.593 --> 01:36:34.803
'Come on. Let's hear it!'

01:36:36.347 --> 01:36:38.349
'Fantastic!'

01:36:46.065 --> 01:36:51.153
Now it's time for the big show, folks.
As you can see, it's almost zero hour.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.074
'In 15 minutes, the curtain goes up
on the Great American Revolution.'

01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:59.536
So move up that way
and see the world turn upside down.

01:36:59.703 --> 01:37:02.623
Ticket holders,
assemble at the boarding platform.

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:06.043
'Don't be cowards, folks.
You only live once.'

01:37:11.924 --> 01:37:14.969
I'll be back in a few minutes. Thank you.

01:37:18.347 --> 01:37:21.183
- Where to now?
- The rollercoaster.

01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:24.687
- We'll never get on.
- I just wanna see.

01:37:24.853 --> 01:37:27.231
OK.

01:37:28.565 --> 01:37:31.485
The same device he used in Richmond.

01:37:31.652 --> 01:37:33.654
Gentlemen, you've earned our thanks.

01:37:33.821 --> 01:37:39.451
I'd like to send
letters of commendation to your chief.

01:37:41.829 --> 01:37:44.498
Well? Any suggestions?

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:50.170
What can we do? We know what he
sounds like but not what he looks like.

01:37:50.337 --> 01:37:52.881
Young voice. Can't be more than 30.

01:37:53.048 --> 01:37:56.176
So we eliminate women, old men and kids.

01:37:56.343 --> 01:38:00.055
- That leaves 10,000 suspects.
- Will somebody make a decision?

01:38:00.222 --> 01:38:03.767
- About what?
- Do we go or don't we?

01:38:03.934 --> 01:38:05.936
- Nothing in the cars?
- No, sir.

01:38:06.103 --> 01:38:10.149
He can't know we've found it.
I think we're safe for today.

01:38:10.316 --> 01:38:13.152
Is that a yes or a no?

01:38:18.365 --> 01:38:19.533
That's a yes.

01:39:16.131 --> 01:39:19.134
'Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:39:19.301 --> 01:39:24.265
'Will the lucky holders of the gold tickets
please go to the front of the line.'

01:39:30.854 --> 01:39:33.148
OK, guys. Let's go.

01:39:42.074 --> 01:39:46.287
- I wish we had gold tickets.
- We'll catch the next one.

01:39:46.453 --> 01:39:51.375
Look at that mother. Bet it hits 5Gs
going into that loop.

01:39:51.542 --> 01:39:54.545
Mmm. Far out.

01:39:58.757 --> 01:40:01.719
One damn day. One day.

01:40:01.885 --> 01:40:04.847
You didn't have to play golf
with your buddies.

01:40:05.014 --> 01:40:07.600
It's my only day off!

01:40:07.766 --> 01:40:11.687
Look at that. It'll be two hours
before they get on anything.

01:40:11.854 --> 01:40:14.815
- We'll go with it.
- We haven't even eaten.

01:40:14.982 --> 01:40:18.652
- Lock the door.
- If it was your mother you'd be on time.

01:40:18.819 --> 01:40:21.614
If it was my mother we wouldn't have come.

01:40:37.338 --> 01:40:40.215
Mr Mayor, welcome to Magic Mountain.

01:40:40.382 --> 01:40:42.426
Thank you.

01:40:47.556 --> 01:40:50.184
- Photographers ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:41:10.037 --> 01:41:13.999
Be on the lookout for any kind
of suspicious behaviour.

01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:16.919
He'll be carrying
a miniaturised transmitter.

01:41:17.086 --> 01:41:20.381
When the coaster starts its run,
watch the crowd.

01:41:20.547 --> 01:41:24.468
He thinks his bomb is still in place.
He'll try to set it off.

01:41:24.635 --> 01:41:28.389
- Where are you going?
- Fresh air. It's like a sauna in here.

01:41:52.204 --> 01:41:56.166
- Get your hands off me!
- What have you got there?

01:41:56.333 --> 01:41:59.295
- It's the Fourth of July.
- No drinking in the park.

01:42:29.116 --> 01:42:32.119
That's a hell of a balloon.

01:42:42.963 --> 01:42:47.927
Please show your tickets. Only special
gold ticket holders for the first ride.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.954
Hey, look!

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.374
- Wow!
- Can you take a picture!

01:43:23.879 --> 01:43:27.091
We've got two gold tickets!
We'll be right there!

01:43:30.594 --> 01:43:32.930
- Do you want to sell your ticket?
- No.

01:43:33.097 --> 01:43:35.224
I'll give you $100.

01:43:35.391 --> 01:43:37.643
- You gotta be crazy!
- But I wanna go!

01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:42.856
- 100 bucks is 100 bucks.
- Come with me. I only need one ticket.

01:43:43.023 --> 01:43:46.652
- Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.
- Thank you.

01:43:46.819 --> 01:43:49.697
- You're gonna miss the first ride?
- Yep.

01:43:49.863 --> 01:43:51.198
He's crazy!

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.327
Dad!

01:43:55.494 --> 01:43:59.665
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Having fun. Do you wanna join?

01:43:59.832 --> 01:44:03.544
Take Tracy and get out of here.
This is not the place to be right now.

01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:07.006
Does this have anything to do
with those phone calls?

01:44:07.172 --> 01:44:11.093
Yes. Now please take her home.
We can all come back next week.

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:14.305
- Maybe the line will be shorter.
- You're gonna miss it!

01:44:30.571 --> 01:44:33.616
- All set?
- Yeah. Thank you.

01:44:50.382 --> 01:44:51.884
They've started.

01:46:27.855 --> 01:46:29.898
Hey, there's the loop!

01:47:52.022 --> 01:47:58.654
Over here! Everybody come this way!
Come on! It won't take a minute!

01:47:58.821 --> 01:48:00.364
Thank you.

01:48:00.531 --> 01:48:02.950
Did you have a good time?

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:08.163
OK, sir, hurry it up a little bit.

01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:12.501
Ladies and gentlemen, here they come!
Our first survivors!

01:48:12.668 --> 01:48:15.587
Congratulations!
How did you enjoy the ride?

01:48:15.754 --> 01:48:19.466
Incredible! I've got to go on it again!
We've got to get in line!

01:48:19.633 --> 01:48:23.345
- What about you, ma'am?
- It was so exhilarating!

01:48:24.638 --> 01:48:27.808
What about your husband?
Did he keep his eyes open?

01:48:27.975 --> 01:48:30.853
- Course he did.
- We want to go again!

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.397
Sir, how did you like the ride?

01:48:33.564 --> 01:48:37.109
- Sir?
- It was fine. Just fine.

01:48:37.276 --> 01:48:42.072
Tell your grandchildren you were
the first to ride the Revolution.

01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:46.327
- How does it compare to other rides?
- It will get a lot of attention.

01:48:48.078 --> 01:48:50.706
- What's it like?
- She rode it.

01:48:50.873 --> 01:48:53.500
Play that back.
The guy you just interviewed.

01:48:53.667 --> 01:48:56.295
- Who are you?
- Play it back!

01:49:04.929 --> 01:49:07.932
'Sir, how did you like the ride?

01:49:08.098 --> 01:49:11.518
- 'Sir?
- 'It was fine. Just fine.'

01:49:11.685 --> 01:49:16.106
'Tell your grandchildren you were
the first to ride the Revolution.

01:49:16.273 --> 01:49:20.027
- 'How does it compare to other rides?'
- 'It will get a lot of attention.'

01:49:25.366 --> 01:49:29.036
- Let's grab the last car!
- Run! Let's hurry!

01:49:35.876 --> 01:49:39.171
- I'll take the bear.
- It's a buffalo.

01:49:39.338 --> 01:49:41.799
It's been on every ride in the country.

01:49:53.769 --> 01:49:57.731
- It looks like Calder's after somebody.
- Who?

01:49:57.898 --> 01:50:01.068
- I don't know.
- Well, help him! Close in!

01:50:01.235 --> 01:50:03.529
Put me through to all units.

01:50:06.115 --> 01:50:07.866
Excuse me.

01:50:12.788 --> 01:50:14.665
What the...

01:50:26.677 --> 01:50:30.889
That's him. He just got off the coaster.
Tell Hoyt.

01:50:31.348 --> 01:50:33.392
'Our man just got off the coaster.'

01:50:33.559 --> 01:50:36.312
- He was on the first run.
- He planted something.

01:50:36.478 --> 01:50:39.481
Call them. Tell them to stop it.
Clear out the passengers.

01:50:39.648 --> 01:50:42.985
Ah, I feel like I'm on top of the world!
Oh!

01:50:52.745 --> 01:50:57.499
Look this over. See if you can find
the frequency he was using.

01:50:57.666 --> 01:51:00.919
- They're over the lift. It's too late.
- Christ.

01:51:02.963 --> 01:51:05.507
I feel like I'm flying!

01:51:17.311 --> 01:51:18.896
Hold it!

01:51:21.148 --> 01:51:24.610
Harry, don't come any closer.

01:51:24.777 --> 01:51:27.279
It's a detonator. Hold your fire.

01:51:34.703 --> 01:51:38.999
The bomb... is in one of those cars.

01:51:39.166 --> 01:51:42.086
He's got a transmitter.
Damn it, put those guns away.

01:51:42.252 --> 01:51:46.131
- He could push the button.
- Suppose he's bluffing.

01:51:46.298 --> 01:51:48.968
Harry.

01:51:49.134 --> 01:51:52.638
- Tell them I don't bluff.
- Put them down!

01:52:01.730 --> 01:52:05.150
Now, have them clear me a path.

01:52:05.317 --> 01:52:07.361
Quickly.

01:52:09.363 --> 01:52:11.407
- Move back!
- Make room!

01:52:19.915 --> 01:52:24.295
- I think I can jam the frequency.
- Then what are you waiting for?

01:52:25.754 --> 01:52:28.257
Now what do you want me to do?

01:52:28.424 --> 01:52:31.802
- Now, Harry, get me a gun.
- You heard him.

01:52:31.969 --> 01:52:34.346
To hell with him.

01:52:40.144 --> 01:52:45.941
It's not gonna work. When the ride's over,
you'll have nothing to bargain with.

01:52:46.108 --> 01:52:50.321
Harry, Harry. You still don't understand.

01:52:50.487 --> 01:52:53.532
You'll be my leverage.

01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:58.621
If they don't let me out, I'll kill you.

01:53:01.081 --> 01:53:03.334
Come on, come on.

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:06.211
Harry, the gun.

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:20.601
- It's jammed.
- Take the son of a bitch!

01:53:20.768 --> 01:53:23.062
'We've jammed his frequency!'

01:54:55.487 --> 01:54:59.408
'Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:54:59.575 --> 01:55:03.787
'The rides are reopening now
for your enjoyment.

01:55:03.954 --> 01:55:07.124
'We apologise for the delay.
Have a happy Fourth of July

01:55:07.291 --> 01:55:10.252
'and a wonderful time at Magic Mountain.'

01:55:12.379 --> 01:55:14.465
- Can I bum one of those?
- What?

01:55:14.632 --> 01:55:17.259
- A cigarette.
- Sure.

01:55:23.599 --> 01:55:25.851
Got a light?

01:55:26.018 --> 01:55:28.646
Keep 'em, OK?
