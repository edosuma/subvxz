00:09.342 --> 00:10.677
Hey, May!

00:10.677 --> 00:12.053
Solly, how's the baby?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.304
Burpy, but good!

00:15.014 --> 00:16.224
Morning, May.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.685
- Nicola, love the hair.
- Thanks!

00:18.685 --> 00:20.103
Morning, May.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.106
<i>♪ You've got to pick up
Every stitch... ♪</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:25.108
- From Gavin with love.
- Oh, thanks, Trish.

00:27.986 --> 00:32.949
<i>♪ ...Must be the season
Of the witch... ♪</i>

00:32.949 --> 00:35.785
- Fixed it!
- Yes. Because you're
a genius, Leo.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.623
<i>♪ ...Must be the season
Of the witch ♪</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:43.918
May. I need
those TPS annuals. Come on.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.712
Oh, um, I thought
you were doing those.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.299
I...I did the tax reviews
over the weekend
like you asked.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.301
Oh, you know my job too?

00:51.301 --> 00:53.845
Just gonna step on my head
like a rung on a ladder?

00:54.804 --> 00:56.014
Oh, Bryce...

00:56.014 --> 00:58.349
- Hmm?
- It's... just...

01:03.813 --> 01:04.814
It's just dry skin.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.486
Don't ever assume to know
someone else's dermatology.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.112
Sorry.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.661
What's with her? Huh?

01:18.661 --> 01:21.873
- May again?
- Yeah, I can barely
get a cup of coffee.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.708
You look like
you could use one, Bryce.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.544
Up all weekend,
working on these tax returns.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.339
Honestly, I don't
think she has any idea

01:29.339 --> 01:32.258
what we do here
at Rotary Resources Group.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.343
No fucking clue.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.514
Frankly, I think
she better vamoose!

01:44.354 --> 01:45.897
Bryce,
what are you doing?

01:45.897 --> 01:47.232
What are you doing?

01:47.232 --> 01:48.525
No!

01:56.825 --> 02:01.329
<i>♪ Must be the season
Of the witch ♪</i>

02:01.329 --> 02:06.042
<i>♪ Must be the season
Of the witch, yeah ♪</i>

02:06.042 --> 02:10.088
<i>♪ Must be the season
Of the witch ♪</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:16.427
Another
Harvey Wallbanger, Leo.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.847
We're all out
of Galliano, May.
You cleaned us out.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.806
Oh, uh...

02:21.182 --> 02:22.892
Vodka and OJ is fine.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.102
Oh, and a cherry.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.731
Tough day?

02:30.692 --> 02:31.568
Oh.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.444
I lost my job.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.529
Shoot.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.865
Downsizing?

02:37.949 --> 02:38.825
You could say that.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.495
G and T.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.914
Easy on the T.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.083
I'm sure it's just
a temporary setback.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.002
Oh.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.420
It's my fourth job in a year.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.840
Oof.
Tough out there.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.843
Especially if you have
an ounce of talent.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.928
It's like having
a bull's eye on your back.

02:58.928 --> 02:59.929
Kiss up...

02:59.929 --> 03:01.055
Kick down.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.725
What do you do?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.233
"The Organization"?

03:12.233 --> 03:14.068
Human development.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.697
We identify people's
special aptitudes and
then cultivate them.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.325
Before that, I was at the UN.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.327
Wow.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.829
Um...

03:24.829 --> 03:29.292
So, uh, what if someone's
special aptitudes

03:29.292 --> 03:30.835
were a little unpredictable?

03:33.546 --> 03:37.759
Sometimes the brightest lights
come from the darkest places.

03:39.052 --> 03:39.886
Mmm!

03:42.055 --> 03:44.182
Let me guess. There's a...

03:44.182 --> 03:47.477
signup fee and
I have to bring three friends.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
No fee, no friends.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.190
Hmm.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.150
Turn the card over.

04:06.162 --> 04:06.996
Say them.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.166
And then what?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.419
And then you're done.

04:14.921 --> 04:15.755
Um...

04:16.839 --> 04:17.674
Azarath.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.428
Metrion.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.557
Zinthos.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.313
I just found
some more Galliano.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.191
Oh.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.486
Cheers.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.300
Anybody get
him talking yet?

05:01.300 --> 05:03.094
No,
he's pretty shaken up.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.596
Rachel's working
on him, though,

05:06.681 --> 05:09.058
They seem to have a connection.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.060
I don't think
he was going to be
the next victim.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.231
I think she wanted him
for some other reason.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.816
Tim checked Sebastian's record.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.401
He's never been
violent in his life.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.902
Hmm.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.571
His mother dies,
he gets set up for murder.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.448
Add Lex Luthor dying,
the whole slaughterhouse gang.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.493
As crazy as it sounds,
this thing has
a familiar ring to it.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.912
No, I was thinking
the same thing.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.789
It's just like when
we all first met.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.669
I heard this song recently.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.380
When Jinx stoned me,
I somehow made it
back to the Elko Diner.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.008
And this old Tamaranean
song came on.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.926
About a red moon.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.721
A red moon?

05:46.721 --> 05:50.933
Something like,
"When the red moon comes,
my true fight begins."

05:50.933 --> 05:53.186
Everything about it
felt like a warning.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.522
It's just a song in a jukebox,

05:56.522 --> 05:57.648
- in your dream--
- No.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.233
It's not just a song.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.029
It was my song.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.364
They sang it to me
all the time when
I was a kid.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.285
We better get
back on the road.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.661
Moving target's harder to hit.

06:20.254 --> 06:23.883
Hey, have you asked Sebastian
what those weird symbols
in his video game mean?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.969
I will get there but right now
we're just talking ramen.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.639
Before the taxidermy job,
he was an aquarium cleaner.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.141
He likes night work.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.518
Oh, congratulations.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.020
You guys rescued
an insomniac who
can stuff a cat.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.605
What about the woman
in the police station?

06:37.605 --> 06:38.898
Says he doesn't know her.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.149
You guys have Marmite?

06:40.149 --> 06:42.151
Uh, top shelf.
Behind the pretzels.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.027
Try it.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.362
I'm going in with ramen.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.198
So...

06:48.825 --> 06:50.034
...son of Superman, right?

06:51.744 --> 06:52.870
Sort of. yeah.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.080
Cool.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.581
Can you fly?

06:55.581 --> 06:56.541
No.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.959
Hmm. That's a shame.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.502
What about the magic phobia?

07:00.711 --> 07:01.838
The what?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.631
The magic phobia?

07:03.631 --> 07:07.343
Hmm. Superman kind of has
a brown thumb when
it comes to magic.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.386
It flusters him.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.763
That's not true.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.057
Actually, it is.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.561
I mean, I never met the man.
It's just what I read.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.699
Hey.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.867
I got you some...

07:31.701 --> 07:34.162
ramen, if you're hungry.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.458
Why did you guys do that?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.170
In the police station.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.339
You needed help.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
Did I?

07:47.842 --> 07:48.885
Yeah.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.512
Trust me, you did.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.141
They say it's because
of the hydrocarbons.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.894
The reason it's red.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.940
It's giving me bad dreams.

08:04.984 --> 08:05.860
Me too.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.030
I can barely sleep.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.952
Sebastian, um,

08:14.952 --> 08:16.662
the woman
at the police station...

08:18.539 --> 08:19.916
What did she say?

08:21.834 --> 08:26.339
She said that she's known
me since before I was born.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.593
And that she would help me.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.304
If I'd only let her.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.265
Let her?

08:36.265 --> 08:38.434
She wanted
me to say...

08:43.022 --> 08:44.023
these words.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.611
That made me feel...

08:52.865 --> 08:53.783
I don't know...

08:56.202 --> 08:57.745
something strange.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.830
Can you tell me?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.586
Just... one.

09:07.129 --> 09:07.964
Azarath.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.715
Metrion?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.300
- And then, Zin--
- No!

09:12.635 --> 09:14.387
No.

09:18.557 --> 09:19.892
That's impossible.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.686
She asked him
to join the Organization.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.229
Wanted him to say the words.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.481
Rachel, there's
no one left at the asylum.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.732
They're all gone.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.567
What if they're not?

09:28.567 --> 09:30.486
You dealt with Trigon.
He's done.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.155
Come on, tell me you both
haven't thought about this.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.074
What if they're back?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.743
You know what they can do.
We all know.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.828
The fire at the asylum.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.870
No one survived.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.331
They couldn't have.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.459
You sure about that?

09:53.801 --> 09:55.219
Come on.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.561
 Mmm.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.646
These strawberries
are positively--

10:05.646 --> 10:06.564
Trigonic?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.696
Does he eat strawberries?

10:13.696 --> 10:17.450
Everything you eat, he tastes.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.826
Just Gina or all of us?

10:18.826 --> 10:19.827
All of us.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.165
But he's noticed
you two in particular.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.458
He'd like to meet you both.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.544
Has he met all the other girls?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.171
None of them.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.467
One of you could be the first.

10:34.467 --> 10:39.680
Meeting him will yield
special rewards, but it
also requires special faith.

10:40.890 --> 10:41.766
Faith in what?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.439
The power of his love.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.734
And the rewards?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.197
He will show you what
lies in your depths.

10:56.864 --> 10:57.698
Grow it.

10:58.991 --> 10:59.992
Teach you to control it.

11:02.995 --> 11:03.829
Er--

11:03.829 --> 11:04.747
I'll go.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.041
Hmm? You should come.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.042
I'll take care of you.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.754
I can't believe
we're doing this.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.673
The asylum was burned down.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.883
We're gonna
take another look.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.551
Make sure we didn't
miss anything.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.053
Can somebody
fill me in, please?

11:19.053 --> 11:21.555
The Asylum was run
by the Organization.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.682
- It's a cult.
- My dad's cult.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.351
Hey, your dad led a cult?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.560
Yeah.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.145
He is the reason
I came to Earth.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.106
To kill him.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.857
What? To kill me.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.110
You tried to kill Rachel?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.986
Hey, I thought we
sorted this all out.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.697
We did. I'm just, like,
telling him the facts.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.658
It's too bad Superman
is in another galaxy.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.744
Mmm, Superman
steers clear of magic.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.621
Probably why he's out in space.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.957
He's saving a planet
from an unstable red dwarf.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.626
Yeah, the old "red dwarf
ate my planet" excuse.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.879
So, who is Rachel's dad?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.297
Trigon.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.133
Who's Trigon?

12:02.721 --> 12:06.809
Trigon's a demon of inter-
and extradimensional origin.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.644
At birth, he killed
his own mother.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.438
My grandmother.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.482
And before
his first birthday,
he ruled an entire planet.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.777
At the age of six,
he destroyed an entire planet.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.571
Then he tried
to take our planet.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.239
- Take?
- Annihilate.

12:26.745 --> 12:27.997
Hey, can I drive this thing?

12:30.499 --> 12:31.834
What did we ever
do without her?

12:42.761 --> 12:47.057
Hello, ladies and
gentlemen. Welcome back
to the asylum.

12:47.057 --> 12:51.020
Strange. This store
never came up on my GPS.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.189
It's just blank. A black hole.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.233
It's gone.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.652
They made it
a Super Super Mart.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.738
There's something here.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.408
Yeah, they've got
power tools, fresh groceries
and a hunting section.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.284
Gar.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.914
And a ridiculous
amount of ravens.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.557
I got something.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.606
The hell is that?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.691
Just your standard
portal to hell.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.276
Conner.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.751
If anybody
wants to wait here...

13:55.751 --> 13:57.753
All right.
Come on. Let's go.
Sebastian, with me.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.771
You're playing with fire
letting them go in there.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.274
Sebastian
must learn the story.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.608
They're all
in the story.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.235
The Tamaranean
might not like her part.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.279
It's already been written.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.447
You can't change your fate.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.533
We did.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.661
Because we're stronger.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.126
We have old friends who
have been waiting for this day.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.296
When I say the word they
will rise up and fight for us.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.847
Hounds of hell...

14:51.557 --> 14:52.433
It's time.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.878
 For the honor
of his impossible love,

15:21.962 --> 15:24.673
you must prove your conviction.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.426
Let him catch you.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.213
No. No, I can't.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.673
I can't. I can't do it.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.676
Yes, you can. Come on!

16:08.676 --> 16:11.095
Come on.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.057
No. No, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.934
Hey. We're almost there.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.519
Just look up.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.899
- Just look up.
- Do you think
he'll be there?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.028
Yeah, of course.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.950
I want to be his queen.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.497
There can only be one.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.491
He'll be here soon.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.784
You look beautiful.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.289
I'm so sorry, May.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.418
You were not your best self.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.692
Congratulations.

18:30.692 --> 18:34.696
You were both faithful,
courageous and strong.

18:34.696 --> 18:39.076
But you... had heart, May.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.287
From him.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.814
He's here.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.403
Anybody
remember this area?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.781
No.
Doesn't look familiar.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.783
The fire never
made it down here.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.201
Like it was sealed off.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.833
Let's split up.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.627
You guys go right.
We'll go left.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.157
Cheery little suite.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.078
This was her room.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.122
The woman
from the police station.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.583
How do you know that?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.127
It was on the floor.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.718
See this is her,

20:19.718 --> 20:20.802
when she was young.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.804
But what?

20:24.306 --> 20:25.807
I don't know her.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.894
But I do know her.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.023
Her name is Gina.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.400
She's my neighbor
from across the hall.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.697
They've been monitoring you,
the Organization.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.618
What do they want from me?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.578
They could be looking
for something.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.830
A blood type or genetic marker.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.921
Guys, check this out.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.093
It's like
some creepy fairy tale.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.346
Well, that could be me.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.098
Trigon, the child.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.686
And that could be me.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.191
And this...

21:20.362 --> 21:21.822
This could be all of us.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.827
Or it could
just be a fairy tale.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.829
And the song
playing on the jukebox.

21:29.871 --> 21:30.872
Just a song.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.254
Looks like someone
busted her out of here.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.982
The fire probably broke down
all the security.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.234
It tried
to get rid of them, but--

21:59.234 --> 22:00.235
We let her out.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.493
You know,

22:08.493 --> 22:10.746
I can help you with this
magic phobia of yours.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.122
I don't have a phobia.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.416
Okay.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.794
Well,
let me just tell you
how magic works.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.589
It's really
just a contest of will.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.133
- I have plenty of will.
- Yeah.

22:23.133 --> 22:27.429
You can't decide
if your will is good or bad.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.599
Hold on. Superman
doesn't have a will problem.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.850
He knows he's good.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.268
Hmm.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.686
You know, I'm not so sure.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.563
He has so much more power
than everybody else.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.274
You must wonder if he's good
or just a bully.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.817
It probably gives him doubts.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.112
Superman doesn't have doubts.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.198
We all have doubts.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.909
Hey, I think
we found something.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.328
It's a bunch of tapes.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.346
Hey, are you and Darlene...

23:09.346 --> 23:10.514
Just friends.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.478
No.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.272
Hey, be careful.
He'll hear you.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.565
Oh, he's heard us.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.570
This room could use some blue,
don't you think?

23:26.488 --> 23:27.656
<i>A dump truck or two?</i>

23:28.573 --> 23:30.075
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:30.075 --> 23:32.327
<i>Some cowboy
spurs and a little vest?</i>

23:32.327 --> 23:34.329
<i>I think
he's got his heart
set on a girl.</i>

23:36.873 --> 23:39.459
She was like Angela,
my mother.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.754
Looks like you have a sister.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.297
Wait, there's a twist.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.411
Wait, wait.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.537
It's a boy.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.623
Sorry, May.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.583
Give me my baby!

24:19.583 --> 24:21.418
The prophecy is well known.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.713
The chosen one must be a girl.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.131
The prophecy is wrong.

24:26.798 --> 24:27.841
Give him back!

24:27.841 --> 24:28.884
I will hunt you!

24:28.884 --> 24:30.552
Muzzle her.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.183
You were the one
they were waiting for.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.269
The one in the prophecy.

24:39.269 --> 24:43.106
All those years,
just waiting for me and my mom.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.524
You should listen to the rest.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.211
Remove the muzzle.

25:14.554 --> 25:15.513
Stand back.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.148
You don't need to worry.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.152
I have nothing
but love in my heart.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.405
Love for my son.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.159
He's my strength.

25:36.159 --> 25:40.455
Your love just wasn't enough
to make the prophet.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.041
My son is the prophet.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.420
But he needs time to grow.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.467
Renounce this blasphemy.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.636
And you can go back
and live with the others.

26:00.558 --> 26:03.561
He will ascend
under the blood moon
to join his father.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.941
His power will have no equal.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.403
Together, they will
take the world.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.326
As you wish.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.011
Sebastian.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.682
Sebastian.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.850
<i>Sebastian.</i>

26:43.059 --> 26:44.060
<i>Sebastian.</i>

26:47.397 --> 26:48.523
That's my name.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.776
Why did she say my name?

26:51.776 --> 26:52.986
Do you have the mark?

26:52.986 --> 26:53.903
What?

26:54.779 --> 26:55.613
Like this.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.418
He's the one
from the children's book

27:08.418 --> 27:10.503
who makes the hole in the sky.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.921
It's part of their prophecy.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.340
No, no, no, no.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.133
I don't I don't know anything
about any holes

27:15.133 --> 27:16.509
or... or any prophecy.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.719
I'm not anyone.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.637
But they want you to be.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.847
They want me to be what?

27:23.141 --> 27:23.975
A killer?

27:25.143 --> 27:26.811
But you don't have to be.

27:26.811 --> 27:27.937
No, no, no. We...

27:27.937 --> 27:30.065
We have to stop this.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.400
You all have to stop this.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.568
You saw the book.

27:34.819 --> 27:35.779
She dies.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.282
You all die.

27:42.869 --> 27:43.912
He's right.

27:46.706 --> 27:47.749
We got to stop it.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.043
Jinx.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.169
We've got to kill him.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.339
Okay.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.008
I know I'm late
to the end of the world party,

27:57.008 --> 27:58.885
but I'm here now.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.096
- Nobody's killing anybody,
- Dick.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.181
If this guy turns into
a fucking pumpkin--

28:03.181 --> 28:04.265
Nobody is touching him.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.184
Okay, everyone relax, please.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.227
It's waning.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.437
What is?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.189
I've been tracking
the lunar cycles.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.691
The moon is going
into sidereal rotation
which means...

28:13.691 --> 28:16.569
the blood moon
will expire in
about eight hours.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.740
So we only have to keep him
with us for a night.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.118
Then it all goes away.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.828
New ending, new day.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.335
Let's take these tapes with us.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.893
May.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.019
Oh, you're alive.

28:53.982 --> 28:54.816
Okay.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.655
Somebody set
the asylum on fire.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.574
I don't know who,
but thank God for them.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.035
We gotta go now.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.245
I'm done with masks.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.456
- I'll take the axe.
- Let's move.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.841
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?

29:21.676 --> 29:23.219
Give him the other mask.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.387
Let's get out of here.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.738
Shh!

29:42.614 --> 29:43.656
Who the hell is that?

29:51.873 --> 29:52.999
What the hell is that?

29:55.877 --> 29:58.421
Wake up and smell
the undead, people.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.714
There's zombies in the Mart.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.799
I got this.

30:09.807 --> 30:10.975
Oh, blue light therapy, nice.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.977
I think you cleared up
their acne.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.073
Gar, little help.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.070
How many people work here?

31:04.070 --> 31:05.029
Too many!

31:08.324 --> 31:09.492
Head, people!

31:10.535 --> 31:12.036
They need to lose their head!

31:13.204 --> 31:14.038
Rachel!

31:18.376 --> 31:19.335
Get him, Rachel.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.123
I can only hold them
for a few seconds.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.416
All right,
let's get out of here.

31:59.917 --> 32:00.918
Bring the chainsaw.

32:03.546 --> 32:04.380
This way.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.512
So what's the plan?
We're gonna try
and kill 200 zombies?

32:11.512 --> 32:13.014
Uh, yeah, that's the plan.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.682
With that.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.019
Follow me.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.437
Hope this thing's gassed up.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.192
All right, Here's the plan.
We let 'em through
five at a time.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.443
Conner, Rachel and Gar,

32:25.443 --> 32:27.111
you're the principal
head removers.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.738
Me and Kory
will work the front door.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.617
Uh, Dick.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.375
Deathstroke.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.755
Zombie Deathstroke!

32:56.307 --> 32:57.141
Jinx, freeze him!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.018
I need time to recharge!

32:59.018 --> 33:00.561
What are you?
A fucking iPhone 7?

33:02.146 --> 33:03.981
It never ends down here.

33:03.981 --> 33:05.775
This is my fault.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.485
- It's all because of me.
- No.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.028
Look, there's no time
for that right now.

33:09.028 --> 33:11.072
I think this is exactly
the right time,

33:11.072 --> 33:12.865
- I need to do something.
- Sebastian, no.

33:12.865 --> 33:13.908
- No.
- I gotta do something.

33:13.908 --> 33:14.909
- No, wait!
- Wait.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.077
- Sebastian!
- Wait!

33:16.077 --> 33:17.161
You want me?

33:20.581 --> 33:21.624
They won't shoot him.

33:21.624 --> 33:22.917
Let's finish this!

33:25.920 --> 33:26.838
Dick.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.922
I got this.

33:27.922 --> 33:28.840
Conner.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.385
Dick, come on.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.302
Okay, go!

33:38.266 --> 33:39.308
Dude!

33:39.308 --> 33:40.768
Headshot, motherfucker.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.107
Let's get out of here.

33:49.861 --> 33:50.737
Oh, shit.

34:06.878 --> 34:07.795
Shit.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.508
Come to me, Superboy.

34:25.855 --> 34:26.689
Conner!

34:35.698 --> 34:36.616
Tim!

34:43.748 --> 34:45.374
I thought you didn't bleed.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.793
No, I thought so, too.

34:48.085 --> 34:48.961
Shit!

34:53.674 --> 34:55.176
Okay, let's split into groups.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.511
You guys are a decoy.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.512
We're gonna get
Sebastian out of here.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.471
You ready?

35:00.014 --> 35:00.848
Let's go!

35:17.156 --> 35:18.241
Somebody's missing.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.875
I didn't know
zombies could drive.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.964
I don't have time
to work on the voice,

36:14.964 --> 36:17.842
but you gotta admit
I had his body down cold.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.850
Here.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.018
We'll just get you...

36:29.061 --> 36:30.187
into position.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.377
I'll take the gun,
thank you.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.603
He's dead?

37:10.603 --> 37:12.313
Technically, he was
already dead.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.649
If you mean, is he
coming over for <i>apres</i> zombie,

37:14.649 --> 37:16.192
no, it's just us.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.235
You got his gun, I see.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.112
Yep. I'm gonna sell it.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.201
Did you get my text message?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.661
It's been a little crazy.

37:26.661 --> 37:30.248
I get it, superhero stuff.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.917
Are you absolutely sure
this place can't be breached?

37:32.917 --> 37:35.252
Well, Superman and Constantine
tried to break in,

37:35.252 --> 37:36.963
and neither of them could.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.465
It will keep you safe and sound
until the red moon is white.

37:41.842 --> 37:42.885
You okay?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.428
Yeah. I just
gotta clean this up.

38:37.189 --> 38:40.067
All right.
um, so there's a bathroom,

38:40.067 --> 38:45.406
food, water, um...
no Wi-Fi, sorry.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.908
Uh, but we will be
monitoring your vitals.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.535
It'll be just a few hours.

38:49.535 --> 38:50.578
It'll fly by.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.874
Right, yeah, um,
just a few hours, okay.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.714
Hey, Bernard,
is there room for one more?

39:03.049 --> 39:04.091
Of course.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.594
We got stuff to talk about.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.096
Thanks, Rachel.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.017
Hey.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.102
You sure you're all right?

39:18.522 --> 39:19.565
Right as rain.
