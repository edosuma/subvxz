- No way.

Batman, that cannot be.
He was Green Arrow's protégé.

was abducted and replaced...

02:00.513 --> 02:02.947

Green Arrow's sidekick.

02:03.115 --> 02:06.983
The clone was pre-programmed
with a drive to join the Justice League.

over any delays to his admission...

02:10.656 --> 02:12.886

he was a clone or a traitor.

And his subconscious programming
drove him to become League-worthy.

02:21.267 --> 02:24.065
So he struck out on his
own as Red Arrow.

02:24.237 --> 02:28.003

his secondary programming kicked in...

02:28.174 --> 02:31.143

the League to Vandal Savage.

perhaps even destroy this station.
