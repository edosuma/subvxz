WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE CLOSER"...

00:02.236 --> 00:03.737
YOU SAY THAT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ENDED

00:03.771 --> 00:06.040
THE MOMENT TURELL
LEFT YOUR CUSTODY,

00:06.074 --> 00:07.108
BUT IN A CIVIL TRIAL,

00:07.141 --> 00:08.376
THE JURY
MAY VERY WELL DECIDE

00:08.409 --> 00:11.179
THAT YOU BEHAVED
WITH A CALLOUS DISREGARD

00:11.212 --> 00:12.446
TO THE SUSPECT'S LIFE.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.248
AND IF THE CITY ATTORNEY
STARTS TO THINK

00:14.282 --> 00:15.583
THAT HE IS LOSING
THIS CASE --

00:15.616 --> 00:17.818
HE COULD SETTLE.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.387
AND YOU WILL BE ENTIRELY
ON YOUR OWN.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.688
SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:20.721 --> 00:21.822
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.358
GET YOUR OWN ATTORNEY!

00:32.866 --> 00:37.071
Gavin:
AND...TWO WATERS COMING UP.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.340
THANK YOU, MR. BAKER.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.109
OH, CALL ME GAVIN,
PLEASE.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.112
OH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THOSE LABELS.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.746
I TELL OUR MANAGING PARTNER
IT'S VULGAR,

00:45.779 --> 00:47.715
BUT ALL THE OTHER BIG LAW FIRMS
ARE DOING IT,

00:47.748 --> 00:50.084
AND APPARENTLY
WE'RE ALL LEMMINGS.

00:50.118 --> 00:54.088
SO, LET'S REVIEW
THIS CIVIL SUIT, OKAY?

00:54.122 --> 00:55.656
OKAY.
OKAY.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.391
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY,
MR. GOLDMAN,

00:57.425 --> 01:00.428
STATES THAT WHILE YOU HAD
A BLACK GANG MEMBER,

01:00.461 --> 01:02.230
TURELL BAYLOR,
IN POLICE CUSTODY,

01:02.263 --> 01:04.865
HE WAS GRANTED IMMUNITY
IN EXCHANGE

01:04.898 --> 01:06.867
FOR HIS TESTIMONY
ABOUT A DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.803
THE D. MADE THAT GRANT
OF IMMUNITY, NOT ME.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.672
I UNDERSTAND. SOMEONE ELSE
CREATES THE PROBLEM,

01:11.705 --> 01:13.341
POLICE GET SUED --
IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.843
UH, GOLDMAN GOES ON
TO SUGGEST THAT,

01:15.876 --> 01:18.379
"FINDING YOU COULD
NEITHER ARREST

01:18.412 --> 01:20.348
NOR DETAIN TURELL BAYLOR,"

01:20.381 --> 01:22.483
YOU DROPPED HIM OFF
AT HIS OWN RESIDENCE --

01:22.516 --> 01:24.385
IN FRONT OF SEVERAL YOUNG MEN
FROM HIS GANG,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.320
KNOWING THEY INTENDED
TO KILL HIM.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.721
HMM.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.691
MR. BAYLOR WAS LATER FOUND
BEATEN TO DEATH

01:30.724 --> 01:33.394
BY A PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.296
HMM. SOUNDS EXCITING.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.530
IT'S NOT, REALLY.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.565
HMM.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.334
MR. GOLDMAN FINISHES WITH,

01:40.368 --> 01:41.902
"CHIEF JOHNSON
KNOWINGLY CIRCUMVENTED

01:41.935 --> 01:43.671
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:43.704 --> 01:48.409
BY APPOINTING HERSELF JUDGE,
JURY, AND EXECUTIONER."

01:48.442 --> 01:51.845
AND...THOUGHTS?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.519
DO YOU THINK
THE BAYLOR FAMILY

01:58.552 --> 01:59.653
COULD ACTUALLY WIN
THIS CASE?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.689
IT DEPENDS.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.491
AS A FORMER CITY ATTORNEY,

02:03.524 --> 02:06.227
I CAN TELL YOU THAT L.A.
WILL OFTEN AVOID COURT COSTS

02:06.260 --> 02:08.896
BY SETTLING CASES MORE
RIDICULOUS THAN THIS ONE.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.498
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.866
TELL ME SOMETHING,
CHIEF JOHNSON --

02:12.900 --> 02:15.603
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
TO MR. BAYLOR?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.206
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.208
YOU EVER HEARD
OF MURDER BY PROXY?

02:21.509 --> 02:25.145
GAVIN, I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH TURELL BAYLOR'S DEATH.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.816
WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS,
ISN'T IT?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.320
OKAY. SO, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE ME

02:32.353 --> 02:33.821
YOUR 45-SECOND VERSION
OF EVENTS?

02:35.789 --> 02:38.692
UM...IT'S ALL IN HERE.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.729
I'M SORRY.
I MUST HAVE BEEN VAGUE.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.699
ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.601
TELL ME,
FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW,

02:47.635 --> 02:48.969
WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. BAYLOR.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.440
SORRY. UM...

02:52.473 --> 02:54.275
MAY I GET THIS?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.576
NO, GO RIGHT AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR MONEY.

02:55.609 --> 02:59.747
WHAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:59.780 --> 03:01.915
SITTING ON THAT SOFA
COSTS YOU $10 A MINUTE.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.517
YOU WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY
TALKING ON YOUR CELLPHONE,

03:03.551 --> 03:05.619
BE MY GUEST --
I'LL MAKE MYSELF AN ESPRESSO.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.589
WHEN SHARON RAYDOR --
WHEN SHE RECOMMENDED YOU,

03:08.622 --> 03:10.358
SHE SAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA
CHARGE US FOR THE FIRST HOUR.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.660
WHICH I SPENT STUDYING
THE BAYLOR FAMILY FILINGS

03:12.693 --> 03:14.262
AND ALL THE ASSOCIATED MOTIONS.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.696
YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK NOW.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.431
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO COOPERATE WITH ME,

03:17.465 --> 03:19.433
I SUGGEST YOU STICK
WITH YOUR CITY ATTORNEY

03:19.467 --> 03:20.968
AND SAVE YOURSELF
MY $25,000 RETAINER.

03:21.001 --> 03:24.238
$25,000?!

03:25.839 --> 03:29.843
GAVIN Q. BAKER.
THE "Q" STANDS FOR "QUICK."

03:29.877 --> 03:31.779
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT CAPTAIN RAYDOR

03:31.812 --> 03:33.914
WAS GONNA SEND ME TO THE MOST
EXPENSIVE LAWYER ON EARTH!

03:33.947 --> 03:35.583
HEY, LITIGATION
COSTS MONEY.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.817
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY IT.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.286
WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.887
WELL, WHAT ABOUT A HOUSE
AND OUR RETIREMENT?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.889
WE'RE NOT EVEN
LOOKING FOR A HOUSE.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.524
COME BACK.
LOOK, I HAVE A MURDER --
OH, MY GOD -- I HAVE A MURDER.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.958
WE'LL JUST SIT DOWN WITH THE GUY
AND JUST TALK TO HIM.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.794
LOOK, YOU TALK TO HIM.
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.028
WELL, LISTEN.
JUST CALM DOWN.
I CAN'T -- I CAN'T --

03:48.061 --> 03:49.697
LOOK, I'LL TAKE THE BOTTLE
FROM YOU --

03:49.730 --> 03:52.300
NO. NO. FOR $10 A MINUTE,
I'M KEEPING THE WATER.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.739
Gabriel: HOLD IT!

03:58.772 --> 04:00.874
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
LOCKED THE GATE OR...

04:00.908 --> 04:01.909
I CAN'T FIND
MY TENNIS SHOES.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.411
ARE THEY IN YOUR CAR?

04:03.444 --> 04:06.680
UH...I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU WANT ME TO GO LOOK?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.749
NO. NO.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.486
I WASN'T PLANNING ON ANYONE
DYING IN THE HIMALAYAS TODAY,

04:12.520 --> 04:13.854
BUT LET'S JUST GET TO IT.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.988
OKAY.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.958
UH, THE OWNERS
OF THIS HOUSE,

04:17.991 --> 04:19.493
RON AND DEBBIE KING,

04:19.527 --> 04:20.694
THEY'RE PUTTING IN
A NEW RETAINING WALL.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.930
ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO,
911 GOT A CALL

04:22.963 --> 04:24.665
FROM A CITY BUILDING INSPECTOR
WHO HAD COME TO CHECK IT OUT.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.035
THAT'S HIM OVER THERE
IN THE ORANGE VEST.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.670
NICE DRESS, BY THE WAY.
REALLY?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.071
DOES IT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.840
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU NEED

04:32.873 --> 04:34.442
TO BE A POLICE OFFICER
THESE DAYS.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.910
SO, WHAT?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.079
THE CONTRACTOR DUG UP A BODY?
IS THAT IT?

04:39.112 --> 04:43.050
UH, WELL, IT'S MORE LIKE
HE RE-DUG UP A BODY.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.886
LET'S JUST KEEP MOVING AROUND
THE SIDE HERE.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.488
Brenda:
HONESTLY, THESE STAIRS.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.557
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHO TOOK MY TENNIS SHOES...

04:49.590 --> 04:51.024
PERHAPS YOU
MISPLACED THEM.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.494
NO.
SOMEBODY TOOK THEM.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.630
OKAY.
SOMEBODY TOOK THEM.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.535
SO, THIS WAS
THE NEW WALL HERE.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.504
WHY'D THEY TEAR IT DOWN?

05:05.105 --> 05:07.040
YOU OKAY, CHIEF?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.842
OH, I'M FINE!
BE CAREFUL.
WATCH YOUR STEP.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.447
OKAY. TELL HER, MIKE.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.550
Tao: THE CONTRACTOR NEVER PULLED
A PERMIT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.386
SO, WHEN THE CITY INSPECTOR

05:18.419 --> 05:20.754
CAME TO CHECK OUT THE FOOTINGS,
IT HAD TO BE TORN DOWN.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.624
FOUND SOMETHING
NOT UP TO CODE, CHIEF.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.428
TWO TRASH BAGS SLAPPED TOGETHER
WITH DUCT TAPE.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.762
Flynn:
YEAH, DUCT TAPE.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.930
THAT'S JUST NEVER
A GOOD SIGN.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.666
Kendall: OKAY.
IT'S A GUY.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.468
PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,
EXCEPT HIS HEAD'S BEATEN IN.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.069
NOT FINDING A WALLET
OR AN I.D.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.938
NAME'S PROBABLY
DOUG UNDERHILL.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.408
OR PHIL UPLAND.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.810
OKAY.
TURNING OFF THE CAMERA.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.512
ARE YOU SURE, BUZZ?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.680
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
ALL THAT GREAT VICTIM HUMOR.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.850
FAMILIES OF THE DECEASED
JUST LOVE VICTIM HUMOR.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.385
JURIES, TOO.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.153
MAYBE WE COULD GET
ANOTHER LAWSUIT GOING.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.622
OR MAYBE WE COULD JUST
DO OUR JOBS!

05:54.655 --> 05:55.756
OKAY.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.491
WELL...

05:57.525 --> 05:59.827
IN ORDER TO DUMP A BODY HERE
LAST WEEK,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.596
YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW
THAT THE CONTRACTOR

06:02.630 --> 06:03.997
WAS DIGGING A HOLE
IN THE BACKYARD,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.999
WHICH WOULD MEAN
OUR PRIMARY SUSPECTS

06:06.033 --> 06:08.669
WOULD PROBABLY BE THE
OWNERS OF THE HOUSE,
MR. AND MRS. KING.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.739
THEN YOU HAVE THE CONTRACTOR,
HIS CREW,

06:11.772 --> 06:13.474
AND A COUPLE OF THE NEIGHBORS,
I GUESS.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.075
Brenda: MAYBE THEY HAVE
A CONNECTION TO THE VICTIM.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.445
LET'S ROLL HIS PRINTS,
FIND OUT WHO HE WAS.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.447
Tao: FINGERPRINTS?
AH...

06:19.480 --> 06:20.948
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE HAS A RECORD, CHIEF?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
WELL, SOMEONE BASHED
HIS HEAD IN

06:22.950 --> 06:25.719
AND BURIED HIM
UNDERNEATH A RETAINING WALL.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.120
I'M GUESSING HE WASN'T THE MOST
POPULAR PERSON ON EARTH.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.024
OR MAYBE HE WAS A LAWYER.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.129
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ, LET'S FIND
THAT CONTRACTOR, PLEASE.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.865
Provenza:
CHIEF JOHNSON,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.934
MEET THE INCREDIBLY
UNCOOPERATIVE MR. DAVID ROMANO.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.169
I CAN STILL GET
MY WALL INSPECTED

06:42.202 --> 06:43.504
IF YOU MOVE THOSE BAGS
OUT OF THE WAY.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.505
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.839
DEAD BODIES BURIED

06:45.873 --> 06:47.708
IN YOUR LITTLE
HOME-IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.977
TELL ME, MR. ROMANO,
DID YOU SKIP THE PERMIT PROCESS

06:50.010 --> 06:51.645
ON THAT RETAINING WALL

06:51.679 --> 06:53.013
BECAUSE YOU HAD SOMEONE IN MIND
YOU WANTED TO BURY?

06:53.046 --> 06:55.583
LOOK, HONEY, I HAVEN'T BEEN
WAITING HERE FOR HOURS

06:55.616 --> 06:57.818
TO ANSWER STUPID QUESTIONS
LIKE THAT.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.553
NOW, I'M BEHIND SCHEDULE,

06:59.587 --> 07:02.556
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME,
I'M LEAVING!

07:02.590 --> 07:03.757
MR. ROMANO,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.526
MR. ROMANO!

07:05.559 --> 07:07.761
YOU CANNOT JUST WALK AWAY
FROM ME!

07:07.795 --> 07:10.598
WELL, I NEVER!

07:10.631 --> 07:13.934
SIR! I SAID
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU!

07:13.967 --> 07:15.769
OH -- MR. RO--

07:15.803 --> 07:17.771
MR. ROMANO, DROP THOSE KEYS,
OR I'M GOING TO ARREST YOU!

07:17.805 --> 07:18.772
ARREST ME FOR WHAT?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.941
WELL...

07:20.974 --> 07:24.612
WE'LL START WITH...
FELONY RUDENESS

07:24.645 --> 07:26.714
AND WORK OUR WAY OUT
FROM THERE!

07:26.747 --> 07:28.048
MAYBE ADD ILLEGAL BURIAL

07:28.081 --> 07:30.584
AND INTERFERING
WITH A POLICE OFFICER.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.853
HEY, HEY, HEY, DON'T YOU NEED
A WARRANT TO SEARCH THERE?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.154
NOT FOR
WHAT'S IN PLAIN SIGHT.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.856
PLUS YOUR TRUCK
IS ILLEGALLY PARKED, SIR.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.125
AND THIS --
THIS IS ENOUGH TO HOLD YOU

07:38.158 --> 07:39.693
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.894
WHAT WOULD THAT DO
TO YOUR SCHEDULE, HUH?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.630
HOW IS BUSINESS,
BY THE WAY?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.031
ANY CLIENTS GONE MISSING?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.899
MAYBE I SHOULD DIG UP
SOME MORE OF YOUR STUFF,

07:45.933 --> 07:46.900
SEE WHAT ELSE I CAN FIND.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.936
HERE'S MY WORK FOLDER.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.204
CALL EVERYONE.
I GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.273
AND ALL CONTRACTORS
CARRY DUCT TAPE.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.808
SO BIG DEAL.
YEAH,
WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORKERS?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.076
YOU HIRED
ANYBODY NEW LATELY?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.945
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

07:57.978 --> 07:59.513
IN THE BUILDING TRADE
RIGHT NOW.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.714
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH JOBS
FOR MY REGULAR CREW,

08:00.748 --> 08:01.882
MUCH LESS STRANGERS.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.116
WELL,
IF THINGS ARE SO SLOW,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.685
WHY DIDN'T YOU BOTHER
TO GET A PERMIT?

08:04.718 --> 08:05.986
LISTEN, SWEETIE.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.255
THE CITY HAS LAID OFF
SO MANY INSPECTORS,

08:08.288 --> 08:09.723
IT TAKES A MONTH
TO GET ONE OUT HERE.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.628
UNLESS THERE'S A COMPLAINT.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.163
I'M CITING YOU
FOR VIOLATION 106

08:16.196 --> 08:17.831
OF THE L.A. CITY
BUILDING CODE.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.166
YOUR JOB HERE
IS RED-TAGGED

08:19.199 --> 08:20.300
UNTIL YOU FILE A PERMIT.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.169
OH!

08:28.676 --> 08:30.644
DON'T LET HIM GO ANYWHERE.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.048
AFIS IDENTIFIED OUR VICTIM
AS A MR. JOHN DAVID DALE,

08:35.082 --> 08:38.151
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LOT MORE SUSPECTS.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.687
MORE?!

08:39.720 --> 08:40.854
WE ALREADY HAVE
TOO MANY SUSPECTS AS IT IS.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.255
WHY MORE?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.558
WELL, MR. DALE WAS
A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.895
LIVED IN THAT HOUSE RIGHT UP
THERE WITH THE RED AWNING.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.997
A SEX OFFENDER?
MM.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.765
SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST
COVER HIM UP AND CALL IT A DAY?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.102
WHAT WAS HE
REGISTERED FOR?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.870
RAPE OF A MINOR.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.079
ALL RIGHT,
LIEUTENANTS FLYNN AND PROVENZA,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.215
WOULD YOU PLEASE ESCORT
OUR VICTIM TO THE MORGUE?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.984
DETECTIVE GABRIEL,
PLEASE ASK HOLLYWOOD DIVISION

09:11.018 --> 09:13.587
TO HELP ROUND UP SOME OF
MR. DALE'S NEIGHBORS.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.723
FIND OUT JUST HOW POPULAR
HE WAS.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.057
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
PLEASE INVITE THE KING FAMILY

09:17.090 --> 09:18.726
DOWNTOWN FOR A VISIT.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.160
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY BRING
THEIR LITTLE GIRL.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.595
LIEUTENANT TAO,
LET'S GET SEARCH WARRANTS,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.897
GO OVER EVERY SQUARE INCH
OF THIS PROPERTY

09:23.931 --> 09:25.899
AND THE VICTIM'S HOUSE, TOO.
WHAT SHOULD I SAY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.768
WELL, THE VICTIM
WAS BASHED IN THE HEAD,

09:27.801 --> 09:28.769
SO I'D SAY BLOOD --

09:28.802 --> 09:30.303
AND PLENTY OF IT.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.339
THANK YOU.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.853
IT HAD TO BE MURDER

09:45.886 --> 09:46.954
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T INFLICT
THIS KIND OF DAMAGE

09:46.987 --> 09:48.255
ON THE BACK
OF YOUR OWN HEAD.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.123
EVEN HARDER TO TAPE YOURSELF
IN A TRASH BAG

09:50.157 --> 09:51.625
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.862
HOW LONG SINCE HE SHUFFLED OFF
TO BUFFALO?

09:54.895 --> 09:55.996
I'M NOT SURE.
HE'S REMARKABLY WELL PRESERVED.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.064
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.799
UNDER A RETAINING WALL.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.133
AND WHEN WAS THE WALL
PUT UP?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.736
A WEEK AGO LAST TUESDAY.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.071
SO TODAY'S A FRIDAY,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.907
WHICH MEANS MR. DALE
HAS BEEN DEAD FOR...

10:06.940 --> 10:08.108
I'D SAY, 12 DAYS.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.910
VERY SCIENTIFIC.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.879
LIKE I SAID, UNLIKE THE TWO
OF YOU, HE'S WELL-PRESERVED.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.747
AND A GOOD THING, TOO,

10:13.781 --> 10:16.784
BECAUSE HIS BODY PROVIDES A
PRETTY CLEAR MAP OF THE ATTACK.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.285
THESE THREE
CIRCULAR WOUNDS --

10:18.318 --> 10:19.887
IS THAT A HAMMER BLOW
OF SOME KIND?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.221
A BALL PEEN HAMMER -- YES.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.756
THIS ONE UP TOP --

10:22.790 --> 10:24.257
PRETTY LIGHT,
DIDN'T HURT HIM TOO BADLY.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.759
THIS ONE --
A LITTLE HEAVIER BLOW.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.094
STILL NO FRACTURE.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
AND THE LAST ONE
KNOCKED HIM DOWN.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.931
BUT THESE WOUNDS
ARE FAIRLY SUPERFICIAL.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.932
THE HAMMER DIDN'T KILL HIM.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.266
THEN WHAT DID?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.269
SHARP FORCE TRAUMA
AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.138
I NEVER SAW A WOUND
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.306
LOTS OF WEIGHT BEHIND IT.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.374
I-I SHOULD DO A CAST OF IT
FOR YOU.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.744
NOW, ALL I CAN TELL YOU
ABOUT THE MURDER WEAPON

10:43.777 --> 10:45.245
IS THAT IT'S CONICAL
IN SHAPE.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.180
POINTY AT THE TOP AND WIDENING
OUT TOWARD THE BASE.

10:47.214 --> 10:50.450
SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE
MY SECOND WIFE.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.419
UH, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S REVIEW.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.087
THE GUY'S HIT THREE TIMES

10:54.121 --> 10:55.455
WITH A BALL PEEN HAMMER.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.958
THEN FALLS FLAT
ON HIS FACE.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.093
AND THERE ARE ABRASIONS
ON HIS PALMS AND KNEES.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.228
AND THEN HE TRIES
TO CRAWL AWAY,

11:01.261 --> 11:02.362
OVER A ROUGH SURFACE.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.797
AND THEN...

11:03.831 --> 11:07.067
SOMEONE SHOVED A CONE
IN HIS HEAD?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.468
WHAT KIND OF CONE?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.337
Flynn:
DON'T KNOW, CHIEF.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.372
PROVENZA'S WAITING FOR THE CAST
OF THE WOUND TO BE FINISHED.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.108
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT MR. DALE BLED OUT,

11:15.142 --> 11:17.044
SO YOU'RE RIGHT --
SOMEWHERE THERE'S A BIG MESS.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.211
Tao: BUT WE DIDN'T FIND
ANY BLOOD IN THE HOLE,

11:18.245 --> 11:19.780
THE YARD, THE PATIO,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.915
OR IN EITHER THE KINGS' HOUSE
OR THE VICTIM'S.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.917
AND WHOEVER BAGGED MR. DALE
USED GLOVES,

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
SO THERE'S NO PRINTS
ON THE DUCT TAPE.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.756
WELL, I CHECKED
WITH THE VICTIM --
SORRY.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.825
I CHECKED WITH THE VICTIM
OF MR. DALE'S SEXUAL ASSAULT.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.226
IT TURNS OUT
SHE WAS HIS COUSIN.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.829
AND AS FAR AS
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT GOES,

11:35.863 --> 11:36.897
SHE SAID THEIR FAMILY
JUST STOPPED TALKING TO HIM

11:36.930 --> 11:38.365
AND LET IT GO.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.001
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY HE WAS DEAD FOR 12 DAYS

11:41.034 --> 11:42.402
AND NO ONE
REPORTED HIM MISSING.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.137
A CONICAL WEAPON.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.139
MAYBE IT'S A TOOL
FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SITE?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.275
LIEUTENANT TAO,
DID YOU FIND A FUNNEL

11:48.308 --> 11:49.409
OR ANYTHING LIKE IT?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.211
NO. WELL...

11:51.244 --> 11:53.046
I DID SEE SOME PARTY HATS.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.015
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU
TURNED THEM UPSIDE DOWN,

11:55.048 --> 11:56.449
THEY WOULD HAVE
THE PROPER SHAPE.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
BUT, OF COURSE, THEY WERE MADE
OUT OF CARDBOARD...

11:58.485 --> 12:00.187
UH, CHIEF?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.055
I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH
SUSPECTS ON YOUR BOARD.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.430
NOT ONLY WAS MR. DALE
A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER,

12:10.463 --> 12:13.934
HOLLYWOOD DIVISION SAYS
THE LOCAL SCHOOLS

12:13.967 --> 12:15.769
PUT HIS PICTURE UP
ON THEIR PUBLIC NOTICE BOARDS.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.070
PLUS...

12:17.104 --> 12:19.139
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
TO WHERE YOU FOUND HIM

12:19.172 --> 12:21.408
HAS AN EXCELLENT VIEW
OF THE KINGS' BACKYARD.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.911
AND IT'S FOR SALE.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.046
MEET THE OWNERS.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.915
CHIEF JOHNSON,
GREG AND MALIN TURNER.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.884
GREG, MALIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING US OUT TODAY.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.286
COMMANDER TAYLOR TELLS ME
Y'ALL ARE MOVING AWAY.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.888
WHEN WE CAN SELL
OUR HOUSE.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.924
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR OVER SIX MONTHS.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.558
I HAVE A SWEET JOB OFFER
IN CHICAGO.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.393
ADVERTISING COMPANY.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.196
BUT WE'RE NOT MOVING TO CHICAGO
IF WE CAN'T SELL OUR HOME.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.098
AND, CHIEF,
THAT'S THE REAL STORY.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.901
YOU SEE, GREG AND MALIN
HAVE BEEN HAVING OPEN HOUSES.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.803
OPEN HOUSES?

12:49.837 --> 12:52.205
YOU MEAN, WHERE POTENTIAL BUYERS
WALK THROUGH YOUR HOUSE

12:52.239 --> 12:53.340
AND YOUR BACKYARD?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.842
OUR REALTOR
SUGGESTED THEM.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.910
AND, LIKE,
NOT COUNTING NEIGHBORS,

12:56.944 --> 12:58.979
WE'VE HAD MAYBE 200
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS STOP BY.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.881
"BUYERS," GREG.
BUYERS.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.015
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUYERS,
NOT CUSTOMERS.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.151
200?
ONLY NEED ONE.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.518
NOT COUNTING NEIGHBORS,

13:05.552 --> 13:07.520
ALL OF WHOM COULD HAVE SEEN
THE CONSTRUCTION.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.156
AND THE HOLE BEING DUG
FOR THE RETAINING WALL,

13:09.189 --> 13:10.523
SO WE CAN NOW EXPAND
OUR LIST OF SUSPECTS

13:10.557 --> 13:12.425
TO INCLUDE GOOGLE EARTH.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.295
UM, SORRY.
WE'RE -- WE'RE JUST RIFFING.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.865
I DON'T SUPPOSE
EITHER ONE OF YOU

13:17.898 --> 13:19.332
NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL
GOING ON

13:19.366 --> 13:20.934
IN THE KINGS'
BACKYARD RECENTLY?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.469
NO.
NOT REALLY.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.038
WELL, BUT THEIR CONTRACTOR
PULLED OUT ALL THE WIRING,

13:25.072 --> 13:26.506
SO YOU CAN'T SEE OVER THERE
AT NIGHT ANYMORE.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.075
IT'S, LIKE, DARK.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.377
AND WERE YOU FAMILIAR AT ALL
WITH THE VICTIM?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.212
YOU MEAN JOE BLOW?
GREG.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.513
OH. SORRY.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
THAT'S JUST WHAT
EVERYONE CALLED HIM.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.952
COULD BE WE WEREN'T, YOU KNOW,
AS NERVOUS ABOUT THE GUY

13:38.986 --> 13:40.988
'CAUSE...WE DON'T
HAVE KIDS.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.290
AND ALSO WHAT WE HEARD
ABOUT JOHN WAS, LIKE, GOSSIP.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.893
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.328
12 YEARS AGO,
WHEN HE WAS 19,

13:48.361 --> 13:51.298
MR. DALE RAPED
A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.266
OH.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.002
NOT GOOD.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.937
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE KINGS
NEVER LET THEIR DAUGHTER

13:56.970 --> 13:58.638
PLAY OUTSIDE BY HERSELF.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.641
YOU KNOW, DEBBIE HAD TO RUN TO
THE AIRPORT A COUPLE OF TIMES,

14:01.674 --> 14:04.577
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO WATCH KAYLA FOR HER.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.513
AND SHE WAS REALLY,
REALLY PARANOID

14:06.546 --> 14:08.648
ABOUT NOT LETTING KAYLA
GO IN THEIR BACKYARD

14:08.681 --> 14:10.017
WITHOUT AN ADULT.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.152
PARANOID IN WHAT WAY?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.520
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
YOUR KIDS PLAYING

14:13.553 --> 14:15.022
IN FRONT OF
A CHILD RAPIST?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.623
THAT MONSTER SHOULD HAVE
NEVER BEEN ALLOWED

14:16.656 --> 14:18.391
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.660
HOW ARE YOU SO WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH MR. DALE'S CRIMINAL RECORD?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.295
THE MEGAN'S LAW WEBSITE.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.064
YOU TYPE IN YOUR ADDRESS,

14:24.097 --> 14:26.433
AND A BIG BLUE DOT SHOWS UP
WHERE SEX OFFENDERS LIVE.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.202
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
HOW THAT WORKS TO THE POLICE.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.604
AND YOU FOUND OUT MR. DALE
WAS LIVING BEHIND YOU WHEN?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.573
ABOUT A
YEAR-AND-A-HALF AGO.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.008
HE MOVED IN
AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.009
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.110
LEAVING HIM THAT HOUSE.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.046
DID YOU EVER CONFRONT
MR. DALE

14:39.079 --> 14:40.647
OR ARGUE WITH HIM
ABOUT YOUR --
THIS IS ENOUGH!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.449
WE GET READ OUR RIGHTS
AND THEN HAULED DOWN

14:42.482 --> 14:44.151
TO THE POLICE STATION
LIKE CRIMINALS.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.086
WITH OUR CHILD!
KAYLA SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.420
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

14:47.454 --> 14:48.621
YOUR DAUGHTER IS BEING
SUPERVISED BY SPECIALISTS

14:48.655 --> 14:49.689
IN OUR CHILD-CARE CENTER.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.691
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.326
DID MR. DALE
EVER APPROACH KAYLA

14:53.360 --> 14:54.361
OR TRY TO TALK TO HER?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
NO.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.264
AND AS MUCH AS
I HATE THE IDEA

14:57.297 --> 14:59.699
THAT COMPLETELY INNOCENT PEOPLE
LIKE MY WIFE AND I

14:59.732 --> 15:02.202
MIGHT NEED A LAWYER,
I'M CLOSE TO CALLING ONE.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.703
WELL, GET YOUR WALLET
OUT, SIR,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.039
BECAUSE THAT'S A REALLY
EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE

15:06.073 --> 15:07.474
TO JUST COOPERATING
WITH US.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.242
MR. DALE WAS THE CRIMINAL.
NOT US!

15:09.276 --> 15:11.111
AND IF YOU'D BEEN FOUND BURIED
IN HIS BACKYARD,

15:11.144 --> 15:12.412
I'D ALREADY HAVE HIM
UNDER ARREST.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.613
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.715
LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR TO YOU.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.117
WE NEVER SPOKE TO THE GUY.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.087
OUR DAUGHTER NEVER SPOKE
TO THE GUY.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.289
WE NEVER SET FOOT
ON HIS PROPERTY.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.024
AND HE SURE AS HELL
NEVER CAME ON OURS.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.993
AND HE NEVER, EVER
TOUCHED KAYLA,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.727
BECAUSE IF HE HAD --

15:27.760 --> 15:29.963
IF HE HAD EVEN LAID ONE FINGER
ON MY LITTLE GIRL --
RON --

15:29.997 --> 15:31.164
NO.
THAT'S ENOUGH!

15:31.198 --> 15:32.365
NO, NO.
THAT'S ENOUGH!

15:32.399 --> 15:33.700
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DIG HIM UP,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.535
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
BEAT HIM TO DEATH MYSELF

15:35.568 --> 15:37.404
AND DROPPED HIM OFF IN FRONT
OF THE POLICE STATION FOR YOU!

15:37.437 --> 15:38.705
SIT DOWN, MR. KING.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.380
NOW I'M INVOKING MY RIGHT
TO COUNSEL.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.620
WELL, BETTER MAKE
YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.155
BECAUSE IF YOU EVEN
TRY TO LEAVE,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.290
I WILL BE ARRESTING YOU

15:57.324 --> 15:58.558
FOR THE ILLEGAL DISPOSAL
OF HUMAN REMAINS.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.993
WAIT!
WHAT ABOUT KAYLA?!

16:00.027 --> 16:02.129
WE DON'T LEAVE
CHILDREN ALONE

16:02.162 --> 16:04.464
WITH SUSPECTED FELONS,
MRS. KING.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.066
RON!
I DEMAND TO SEE KAYLA.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.167
WE CAN'T LET HER DO THAT!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.302
I DEMAND TO SEE
OUR DAUGHTER!

16:09.336 --> 16:12.705
PLEASE, WHERE IS KAYLA?
SHE WON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!

16:14.441 --> 16:17.044
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO

16:17.077 --> 16:18.611
IF HE EVER COMES
INTO OUR BACKYARD.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.180
BUT...

16:20.213 --> 16:22.315
IF HE STOPS TO TALK TO ME
IN HIS BLUE CAR,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.051
I HAVE THIS.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.293
AND THEN
I'M SUPPOSED TO RUN.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.228
DID YOU TAKE
MR. DALE AWAY?

16:35.262 --> 16:38.031
OR IS HE GONNA STAY
UNDER THE WALL?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.400
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE US TO DO?

16:40.433 --> 16:43.303
UM...
CAN I THINK ABOUT IT?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.504
SURE.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.110
LOOK --

16:50.143 --> 16:52.645
MY OFFICE IS REALLY NOT
A GOOD PLACE TO BRING CHILDREN

16:52.679 --> 16:54.747
WHILE YOU'RE INTERVIEWING
THEIR PARENTS.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.383
WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT ANYWAY?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.185
WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

16:58.218 --> 17:01.188
LOSING WEIGHT IS NOT
JUST ABOUT EATING
BORING, TERRIBLE FOOD.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.722
IT'S ALSO ABOUT EXERCISE.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.625
THIS IS THE TIME THAT I TRY
TO SET ASIDE TO RIDE MY BIKE.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.068
I MOSTLY EXERCISE AT HOME.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.704
CAN YOU JUST HURRY,
PLEASE?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.472
Kayla: I CAN'T EVER HAVE ANYONE
OVER TO THE HOUSE

17:19.506 --> 17:21.841
'CAUSE ALL MY FRIENDS
KNOW ABOUT HIM.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.544
SO I GUESS YOU SHOULD TAKE
MR. DALE AWAY.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.647
DOES NOT HAVING YOUR FRIENDS
OVER BOTHER YOU?
NO.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.517
I GET BOTHERED 'CAUSE MY MOM
GETS SO UPSET.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.851
SHE TOLD MR. DALE
SHE'D KILL HIM

17:31.884 --> 17:33.353
IF HE EVER CAME BACK
TO OUR HOUSE.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.122
MR. DALE CAME OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE

17:36.723 --> 17:38.458
YOU CAN TRUST HER.
SHE'S POLICE, LIKE ME.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.095
I SAW HIM
IN OUR BACKYARD.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.696
DADDY FOUGHT WITH HIM.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.399
FOUGHT WITH HIM HOW?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.768
WELL, MR. DALE WAS SHOUTING
AT MR. ROMANO

17:48.801 --> 17:50.670
FOR BEING SO LOUD,

17:50.703 --> 17:52.205
AND THAT'S WHEN MOM AND DAD
RAN OUT

17:52.239 --> 17:54.607
AND TOLD MR. DALE
IF HE EVER CAME BACK,

17:54.641 --> 17:56.443
THEY WOULD KILL HIM.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.211
AND DID YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
AFTER THAT?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.213
NO. NOT UNTIL
MR. ROMANO DUG HIM UP.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.253
HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW
HE WAS THERE?

18:07.487 --> 18:11.624
THAT, KAYLA,
IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.211
HUH.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.446
HEY, FRITZI!

18:33.480 --> 18:34.781
HEY.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.649
HI.
HI.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.553
SO, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE MAKING DINNER, HUH?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.522
I AM.
HUH.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.690
FRIDAY NIGHT.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.693
JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE WE'D GO OUT...

18:46.726 --> 18:48.228
NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.596
WE NEED TO SAVE MONEY
TO PAY FOR THIS ATTORNEY.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.164
SO NO MORE RESTAURANTS,
NO MORE TAKE-OUT, EITHER.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.699
OH, WELL,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.434
SIX YEARS AFTER
THE TRIAL'S OVER,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.303
YOU'LL FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO HIRE YOUR LAWYER.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.405
Brenda:
SOONER THAN THAT.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.772
I MADE SOME OTHER
CHANGES TODAY.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.943
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

19:03.976 --> 19:05.512
THERE'S A LIMIT
TO HOW MANY NIGHTS A WEEK

19:05.545 --> 19:06.813
I CAN EAT CLAM LINGUINI.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.249
WAIT.
WHAT OTHER CHANGES?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.850
I STOPPED THE NEWSPAPER.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.720
YOU STOPPED
THE NEWSPAPER?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.488
IT'S JUST THAT MUCH MORE
TO CLEAN UP.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.956
AND YOU NEVER READ IT.
LIKE YOU EVER
CLEAN IT UP.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.625
I READ THE PAPER!

19:18.658 --> 19:22.629
I ALSO USE IT TO KEEP TRACK
OF ALL THE BASEBALL SCORES

19:22.662 --> 19:24.964
ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
YOU CAN'T JUST...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.933
Female recorded voice:
TO ACTIVATE TELEPHONE SERVICE
AT THIS LOCATION...

19:26.966 --> 19:28.335
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE PHONE?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.369
OH, I CANCELED
THE LANDLINE.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.503
YOU WHAT?!

19:30.537 --> 19:32.272
LOOK, FRITZI,
YOU NEED TO BE

19:32.305 --> 19:33.873
MORE REASONABLE ABOUT THIS.
WE BOTH HAVE CELLPHONES.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.210
IT'S CRAZY, ALL THIS MONEY
WE'RE SPENDING ON LUXURY ITEMS

19:37.244 --> 19:38.745
WHEN WE HAVEN'T EVEN
BOUGHT A HOUSE.
LUXURY ITEMS?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.480
YOU HAVEN'T WANTED TO LOOK
AT A HOUSE IN THREE YEARS.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.882
ALL OUR CREDIT CARDS ARE
ATTACHED TO THIS NUMBER.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.251
WHAT ABOUT MY SPONSOR?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.985
WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS
FROM A.A.?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.620
OH, I GOT AN IDEA, HONEY.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.657
THEY CAN ALL CALL ME ON
MY CONFIDENTIAL FBI CELLPHONE.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.662
YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE
ALL THESE CHANGES,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.430
YOU DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.499
NOT ONLY IS IT DISRESPECTFUL,

19:59.532 --> 20:00.933
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA...

20:02.469 --> 20:05.872
OH, HONEY, WHAT CHANNEL
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.343
YOU TURNED OFF THE CABLE.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.612
NO! I DIDN'T
TURN OFF THE CABLE.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.715
I JUST CANCELED ALL THOSE EXTRA
CHANNELS WE NEVER WATCH.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.949
THAT YOU DON'T WATCH!

20:16.983 --> 20:18.918
YOU DON'T WATCH THEM!

20:18.951 --> 20:20.820
YOU DON'T READ THE PAPER.
YOU NEVER ANSWER THE LANDLINE.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.389
I'M SORRY. HOLD ON
FOR JUST ONE SECOND.
I'M ON THE PHONE WITH WORK.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.723
YOU DON'T CARE WHAT WE EAT
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE

20:23.756 --> 20:25.024
A CHOCOLATE BAR
AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PLATE.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.026
THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY! TERRIBLE!

20:27.059 --> 20:28.995
AND THIS PHONE CALL
IS ABOUT A SEX OFFENDER

20:29.028 --> 20:32.265
WHO WAS MURDERED, BAGGED, AND
BURIED IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS --

20:32.299 --> 20:34.434
A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN WHAT'S ON TV.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.536
YES, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
I'M SORRY.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.971
UM, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THE CONTRACTOR?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.873
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,
CHIEF.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.575
HE NEVER APPLIED FOR A PERMIT

20:42.609 --> 20:44.611
TO BUILD ANYTHING
AT THE KING PLACE.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.978
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.316
HANG ON. WHAT?
WHAT IS RIDICULOUS?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.319
WE CAN HIRE THE ATTORNEY
WITHOUT STARVING OURSELVES,

20:52.352 --> 20:54.354
ISOLATED FROM
THE MODERN WORLD.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.489
I AM NOT SPENDING
THE MONEY.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.057
WELL, THEN YOU'D BETTER GET IT
FROM THE CITY,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.559
BECAUSE I AM NOT LIVING
LIKE THIS.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.461
YOU KNOW,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

21:01.494 --> 21:04.664
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK
TO YOUR BUDDY POPE ABOUT IT?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.802
UH, CHIEF?

21:09.836 --> 21:13.005
YES, I'M SORRY.
I'M -- I'M HERE.

21:13.039 --> 21:16.509
Look, if the contractor
never pulled a permit

21:16.543 --> 21:18.411
FOR THE RETAINING WALL,

21:18.445 --> 21:20.513
THEN HOW DID THE INSPECTOR KNOW
TO COME BY AND HAVE IT DUG UP?

21:20.547 --> 21:23.850
MR. ROMANO SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A COMPLAINT, DIDN'T HE?

21:23.883 --> 21:26.453
OH! OH, NO...

21:26.486 --> 21:27.754
no, no!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.022
CHIEF?
A

21:30.056 --> 21:32.892
OHH, I'M FINE.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.629
YOU WANT US TO FIND
THE CITY INSPECTOR FOR YOU?

21:36.663 --> 21:38.365
OH, YES, PLEASE.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.767
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.069
CHIEF JOHNSON,
MEET OUR HERO FROM YESTERDAY.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.605
MR. RAYMOND AGUIRRE,
CITY BUILDING INSPECTOR.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.407
MR. AGUIRRE,
THANK YOU SO MUCH

21:47.440 --> 21:49.075
FOR TAKING TIME
TO SEE US TODAY.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.077
WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HELP THE POLICE.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.579
THOUGH I HAVE TO
WONDER WHY

21:52.612 --> 21:54.614
I WAS GIVEN MY RIGHTS
IN THE ELEVATOR.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.583
OH. THAT'S JUST
A NEW CITY POLICY.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.351
YEAH, WE HAVE TO
MIRANDIZE EVERYONE

21:58.385 --> 21:59.952
WHO COMES IN
THE BUILDING NOWADAYS.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.788
DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU
FEEL TOO SPECIAL.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.724
Just want to let you know
I've never taken a bribe, ever.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.792
OH.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.762
THAT'S...GOOD.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.632
UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL,

22:12.665 --> 22:15.535
WOULD YOU PLEASE ESCORT
MR. AGUIRRE TO OUR...

22:15.568 --> 22:16.836
VISITOR'S
CONFERENCE CENTER?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.671
I'LL BE WITH Y'ALL
IN JUST ONE MOMENT.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.407
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.941
SO, AFTER THE KINGS MADE BAIL
LAST NIGHT,

22:21.974 --> 22:23.810
WHY DID YOU ORDER SURVEILLANCE
ON THEIR HOUSE?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.144
THEY'RE SUSPECTS
IN A MURDER, WILL,

22:25.177 --> 22:26.846
AND THEY INVOKED
THEIR RIGHT TO COUNSEL.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.449
NOT EVERYBODY WHO ASKS
FOR AN ATTORNEY IS GUILTY.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.950
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.720
YOU AND CAPTAIN RAYDOR
KEEP SAYING

22:33.753 --> 22:34.954
I NEED TO GET
MY OWN LAWYER,

22:34.987 --> 22:36.122
BUT NO ONE'S OFFERED
TO HELP ME PAY FOR IT.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.157
LOOK, WILL...

22:38.190 --> 22:40.159
CAN'T YOU TALK TO THE UNION
AND SEE IF THEY --

22:40.192 --> 22:41.961
NO, YOU'RE MANAGEMENT.
THE UNION CAN'T HELP YOU.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.830
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE CITY?
CAN'T THEY DO SOMETHING?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.632
YEAH.
LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.800
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
SURRENDER MY LIFE'S SAVINGS

22:47.834 --> 22:51.604
TO DEFEND MYSELF WHEN I AM
COMPLETELY, 100% INNOCENT.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.473
ALL RIGHT.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.808
I'LL ASK THE MAYOR IF HE CAN
FIND THE MONEY TO HELP YOU OUT.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.109
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

22:57.143 --> 22:58.745
IF I'M GONNA BE
PAYING S.I.S. OVERTIME

22:58.778 --> 23:00.447
TO SIT ON THE KINGS' HOUSE
ALL WEEKEND,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.748
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND
OF COMPELLING EVIDENCE

23:01.781 --> 23:03.450
THAT CONNECTS THEM
TO THIS CASE.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.518
BESIDES LYING ABOUT THE FIGHT
THAT THEY HAD WITH MR. DALE

23:05.552 --> 23:06.986
AND FINDING HIM BURIED
IN THEIR BACKYARD?

23:07.019 --> 23:08.855
YES. BESIDES THAT.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.189
WELL,
HOW ABOUT THIS, THEN?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.725
THE VICTIM WAS 6 FEET TALL,
OVER 200 POUNDS.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.661
HOW DO YOU THINK HIS BODY
MADE IT UP THOSE STAIRS

23:14.694 --> 23:15.895
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

23:15.928 --> 23:18.465
THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE.
THAT'S LOGISTICS.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.733
LOOK, I WILL ASK THE MAYOR
TO HELP YOU,

23:20.767 --> 23:22.201
AND IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT,

23:22.234 --> 23:24.637
YOU WILL EITHER RE-ARREST
THE KINGS BY 6:00 P.M.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.805
OR END THE SURVEILLANCE.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.142
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO
MY JOB PROPERLY ANYMORE.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.078
THE CITY CUT BACK
ON THE DEPARTMENT.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.646
AND WE LOST
SOME OF OUR PEOPLE

23:33.680 --> 23:35.582
WHEN THEY WERE ARRESTED
FOR TAKING BRIBES,

23:35.615 --> 23:37.584
WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE
IN MY LIFE -- EVER!

23:37.617 --> 23:40.453
ANYWAY, THERE AREN'T ENOUGH
INSPECTORS LEFT

23:40.487 --> 23:42.054
TO ISSUE APPROVALS,

23:42.088 --> 23:44.056
LET ALONE GO HUNTING
FOR SOME ILLEGAL BUILDING.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.958
SO, MR. ROMANO,
THE KINGS' CONTRACTOR,
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT

23:45.992 --> 23:47.894
TO START THE WORK
WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.597
YES. ABSOLUTELY.
COMPLETELY WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.832
MR. ROMANO NEVER EVEN APPLIED
FOR A PERMIT?
NO.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.567
AND IT'S VERY SHORT-SIGHTED
FOR THE OWNER

23:54.601 --> 23:56.168
TO LET A CONTRACTOR
START BUILDING THAT WAY.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.538
AND NOW IF THE KINGS EVER WANT
TO SELL THEIR HOME,

23:58.571 --> 23:59.939
THE DISCLOSURE LAWS
IN CALIFORNIA

23:59.972 --> 24:01.808
WILL REQUIRE THEM
TO TELL POTENTIAL BUYERS

24:01.841 --> 24:03.209
THAT THEY BUILT
WITHOUT PERMITS.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.145
DISCLOSURE LAWS.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.748
OKAY, SO,
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND,

24:08.781 --> 24:10.983
YOU'RE SAYING THAT NO ONE
IN YOUR OFFICE

24:11.017 --> 24:13.986
EVER KNEW THAT MR. ROMANO
BUILT THE WALL

24:14.020 --> 24:15.688
IN THE KINGS' BACKYARD.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.591
LOOK,
CAN YOU CUT ME A BREAK?

24:18.625 --> 24:21.160
WE DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO CHECK
UP ON BUILDING LIKE THIS.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.095
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW
TO INSPECT IT?

24:25.632 --> 24:26.866
EXCUSE ME?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.501
YOU HAD NO PAPERWORK
ON THIS SITE.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.769
YOU NEVER VISITED IT.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.137
YET A FEW DAYS AFTER
A MAN WAS BURIED THERE,

24:31.170 --> 24:32.939
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO TURN UP
AT THE KINGS' HOUSE

24:32.972 --> 24:35.775
AND DEMAND THAT THE
WALL COVERING UP HIS
BODY BE TORN DOWN?

24:35.808 --> 24:36.843
I DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN
TO SHOW UP.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.044
AND I WASN'T BRIBED,
EITHER.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.912
I WAS RESPONDING
TO A COMPLAINT.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.047
FROM WHOM?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.984
I'M --
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO...

24:45.017 --> 24:48.154
GIVE THAT INFORMATION OUT
TO ANYONE AT ANY TIME

24:48.187 --> 24:49.255
FOR ANY REASON.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.690
I'LL NEVER TELL.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.859
OKAY.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.794
UM, THERE ARE TWO WAYS
YOU CAN CONTACT US.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.596
ONE IS WITH THE TIP LINE,

24:56.629 --> 24:58.164
AND THE OTHER IS BY SENDING
AN E-MAIL, LIKE THIS ONE.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.133
"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.102
"MY NEIGHBORS ARE BUILDING
A RETAINING WALL,

25:03.135 --> 25:05.104
AND NOT ONLY DOES
THEIR CONTRACTOR START
WORK TOO EARLY" --

25:05.137 --> 25:07.073
WHICH IS A VERY
COMMON COMPLAINT -- WE
GET IT ALL THE TIME --

25:07.106 --> 25:09.542
"HE DOESN'T HAVE A PERMIT POSTED
IN THE FRONT YARD."

25:09.576 --> 25:12.812
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE EVEN
CARE ABOUT THAT -- I WOULDN'T.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.814
"COULD YOU CHECK ON THIS
FOR ME?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.215
SINCERELY,
JOHN DAVID DALE."

25:16.248 --> 25:17.550
AND THAT WAS DATED
FOUR DAYS AGO.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.088
WELL, THAT IS
EXTREMELY UNUSUAL.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.724
WHY IS THAT?

25:24.757 --> 25:26.092
BECAUSE WHEN HE WROTE THIS,

25:26.125 --> 25:27.894
MR. DALE WAS BURIED
BENEATH THE RETAINING WALL

25:27.927 --> 25:28.961
HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.609
THANKS FOR SEEING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.111
NOT A PROBLEM.
NOT A PROBLEM.

25:45.144 --> 25:49.115
I HAVE A CLOSING STATEMENT
TO WRITE FOR THIS WEEK,

25:49.148 --> 25:50.683
AND I WORK MOST
SATURDAYS ANYWAY.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.620
WATER?
NO. THANKS.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.621
STILL HAVE A BOTTLE
FROM YESTERDAY.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.255
OH, GOOD.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.591
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.293
WHAT'S UP?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.996
"WHAT'S UP?"

26:04.030 --> 26:06.766
WELL...

26:06.799 --> 26:10.637
JUST...DIVE RIGHT IN.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.742
OKAY.
I NEED A HUGE FAVOR.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.645
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.680
LOOK --

26:20.713 --> 26:23.249
I WANT TO PAY
YOUR RETAINER,

26:23.282 --> 26:26.252
FROM MONEY I INHERITED
FROM MY PARENTS,

26:26.285 --> 26:29.388
BUT I WANT MY WIFE...

26:29.421 --> 26:31.290
TO THINK
IT CAME FROM THE CITY.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.325
I SEE.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.898
WELL...

26:38.931 --> 26:40.667
I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.068
I DO.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.203
BUT I LIKE TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH MY CLIENTS.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.073
WELL, SHE'S NEVER GONNA BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.009
YES, BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MY LYING TO HER

26:50.042 --> 26:51.811
AND HER LYING TO ME.
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.345
LOOK, NOBODY'S
ASKING YOU TO LIE.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.347
OH, WELL, THEN,
MAYBE I'M CONFUSED.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.383
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

26:57.416 --> 27:00.119
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
A VERY GOOD LAWYER,

27:00.152 --> 27:02.855
WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO CLEARLY

27:02.889 --> 27:05.157
AND SIMPLY EXPLAIN THINGS
TO MY WIFE

27:05.191 --> 27:07.760
IN A WAY SHE COMPLETELY
MISUNDERSTANDS.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.066
THAT'S HER.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.405
LOOK...

27:19.438 --> 27:21.307
IF YOU DO DECIDE
TO TAKE BRENDA'S CASE,

27:21.340 --> 27:23.075
IT'D BE GREAT IF YOU
SWUNG BY HER OFFICE

27:23.109 --> 27:24.677
AND TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT
IN PERSON.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.045
PREFERABLY TONIGHT,

27:26.078 --> 27:27.847
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE
TO WATCH SOME TELEVISION

27:27.880 --> 27:29.115
WHEN I GET HOME.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.753
HEY, HONEY.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.255
WHAT IS IT?

27:36.288 --> 27:39.892
UM...THE PARKING LOT
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.160
WHERE ARE YOU?

27:43.495 --> 27:46.933
AN OPEN HOUSE?

27:46.966 --> 27:48.901
WHERE?

28:06.518 --> 28:10.022
YOU'RE, UH,
NOT AT WORK TODAY?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.158
POPE GAVE MOST OF MY DIVISION
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.359
OVERTIME ISSUES.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.161
SO I THOUGHT
WE'D LOOK AT HOUSES.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.262
REALLY?

28:16.295 --> 28:17.496
BUYING A HOUSE --

28:17.529 --> 28:18.998
THAT WILL HELP US
CUT BACK ENOUGH

28:19.031 --> 28:20.299
TO HIRE THE ATTORNEY?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.334
OH, WELL, I SPOKE TO POPE
ABOUT THAT,

28:22.368 --> 28:23.870
LIKE YOU SUGGESTED,

28:23.903 --> 28:25.805
AND HE SAID HE'S GOING
TO LOOK INTO IT.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.207
BUT STILL, HONEY,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.076
THIS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE MORE
HOUSE THAN WE CAN AFFORD.

28:30.109 --> 28:34.346
OH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.784
IT'S A BUYER'S MARKET.
IT'S ONLY $2.5 MILLION.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.852
OH.
ONLY $2.5 MILLION.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.855
I MET THE OWNERS TODAY,
AND THEY'RE DESPERATE TO SELL.

28:42.889 --> 28:46.058
HI, THERE.
HI. CONNER ELLIS.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.960
I'LL BE SHOWING
THE HOUSE TODAY.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.162
YOU GUYS LOOKING
FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.899
WE ARE. I'M BRENDA,
AND THIS IS FRITZ.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.100
WE'RE BOTH DOCTORS,

28:54.133 --> 28:55.367
SO WE'RE PRE-APPROVED
FOR LOANS.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.303
DO YOU MIND IF WE START
IN THE BACKYARD?

28:57.336 --> 28:59.405
IN MY FREE TIME,
I JUST LIVE TO BE OUTSIDE.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.007
AND FRITZI HERE
IS A GRILLER.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.309
A GRILLER?
I'M...I'M A GRILLER...

29:03.342 --> 29:04.777
FROM WAY BACK.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.445
SO IF THE BACKYARD
ISN'T RIGHT,

29:06.478 --> 29:08.147
THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN
LOOK AT THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.248
MAY WE?

29:09.281 --> 29:10.950
OH, SURE.
COME THIS WAY...

29:10.983 --> 29:12.084
DOCTOR.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.853
IT'S A --
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY

29:13.886 --> 29:15.955
TO LOOK AT
SOME OF THE OUTDOOR FEATURES.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.090
AND THE OWNERS KEEP EVERYTHING
SUPER NICE.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.959
GARDENERS COME
TWICE A WEEK.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.262
POOL IS PERFECTLY
MAINTAINED.
MM.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.563
DO YOU MIND IF WE HEAD OUT
ON OUR OWN,

29:24.596 --> 29:25.998
JUST TO GET THE FEEL
OF THE PLACE?

29:26.032 --> 29:27.199
SURE.

29:27.233 --> 29:30.336
OH, MY GOODNESS.
IT IS SO ROMANTIC!

29:30.369 --> 29:32.004
IF YOU THINK SO,
DARLING.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.306
EXCUSE US, CONNER.
CERTAINLY.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.975
TAKE YOUR TIME.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.446
SO TELL ME, DOCTOR,

29:40.479 --> 29:42.448
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR
OUT HERE?

29:42.481 --> 29:43.850
UH, DRAG MARKS OR...

29:46.185 --> 29:47.486
...WHEELBARROW TRACKS.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.127
HUH.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.405
HEY, HON?

30:06.438 --> 30:09.175
LOOK WHAT I SEE.
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.911
THE RUINS
OF A RETAINING WALL

30:11.944 --> 30:14.446
UNDER WHICH SOMEONE
LIKE A MURDER VICTIM
COULD BE BURIED.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.316
DON'T YOU NEED A WARRANT
TO GO POKING AROUND LIKE THIS?

30:17.349 --> 30:19.351
IT SAYS "OPEN HOUSE."
OPEN.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.222
OH, LOOK.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.191
OH, ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL,
HONEY?

30:25.224 --> 30:27.393
LET'S TAKE SOME PICTURES!

30:40.139 --> 30:41.373
OH, MY.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.243
DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.312
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.147
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME

30:48.180 --> 30:50.249
YOU'RE INTO GARDEN GNOMES,
ARE YOU?

30:50.282 --> 30:52.118
NO, BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO MEET THE LITTLE FELLA

30:52.151 --> 30:53.452
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.621
WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN A MISSING GNOME?

30:55.654 --> 30:57.289
BECAUSE HE SAW
THE MURDER,

30:57.323 --> 30:58.490
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.669
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

31:10.702 --> 31:14.040
OH, THE GROUT
BETWEEN THE TILES.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.342
WHAT ABOUT IT?
OH...

31:16.375 --> 31:18.310
HER FATHER TOLD HER

31:18.344 --> 31:20.046
THAT IF THERE ARE CRACKS
IN THE GROUT,

31:20.079 --> 31:22.048
THE HOUSE COULD BE MOVING,
YOU KNOW, EARTHQUAKES.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.582
OH, NO, NO.
WE'D HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.917
HE'S RIGHT, HONEY.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.585
CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE
2079

31:26.618 --> 31:28.487
REQUIRES PROPERTY OWNERS
TO FULLY AND COMPLETELY

31:28.520 --> 31:31.690
DISCLOSE ANY KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH
THE HOUSE BEFORE SELLING THEM.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.960
A BUILDING INSPECTOR
TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT
TODAY FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.629
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH THE TILE, THEN...DOCTOR?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.365
OH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS SIDE'S

31:39.398 --> 31:41.400
RECENTLY BEEN CLEANED
WITH BLEACH,

31:41.433 --> 31:42.969
BUT I'M SURE I CAN GET
WHAT I NEED

31:43.002 --> 31:45.004
WITH THE PROPER LIGHTING.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.438
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE
TO DISCLOSE?

31:46.472 --> 31:48.540
D-DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
THE REST OF THE HOUSE?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.509
LET'S GET THE BAD NEWS
OVER WITH FIRST.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.090
THERE WAS RAIN DAMAGE
LAST YEAR.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.357
IT IS ALL FIXED.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.625
AND...

32:06.658 --> 32:08.961
THE OWNERS HAD TERMITES
FOUR YEARS AGO,

32:08.995 --> 32:10.629
BUT THEY TENTED.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.631
A MEGAN'S LAW REGISTRANT
LIVED BEHIND US HERE --

32:12.664 --> 32:14.200
DIED RECENTLY -- OH, UH,
PARKING ACROSS THE STREET --

32:14.233 --> 32:16.635
MEGAN'S LAW?

32:16.668 --> 32:18.404
A SEX OFFENDER
LIVES CLOSE BY?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.406
LIVED. LIVED.
PAST TENSE.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.141
HE DIED. LAST WEEK.
THANK GOD.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.475
THAT GUY SINGLE-HANDEDLY

32:23.509 --> 32:25.077
KEPT ME FROM SELLING THIS HOUSE
FOR MONTHS.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.312
ANYWAY, UH,
STREET PARKING IS --

32:26.345 --> 32:28.047
THANK YOU, CONNER.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.249
WHICH WAY IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM, PLEASE?

32:33.385 --> 32:36.388
Fritz: IT'S ONE OF MY WIFE'S
LITTLE QUIRKS.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.390
FIRST THING SHE NEEDS TO KNOW

32:38.424 --> 32:41.260
IS IF THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM
FOR HER SHOES.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.095
SHOES, UH,
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.563
YEAH. YEP.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.765
YEP.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.467
UH

32:48.500 --> 32:51.270
Y-YOU FINDING EVERYTHING
YOU WANT IN THERE?

32:51.303 --> 32:52.471
OH, I AM.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.206
IN FACT...

32:54.240 --> 32:59.611
I THINK I'M READY TO MAKE
THE OWNERS AN OFFER RIGHT NOW.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.447
Gabriel: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.382
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU

33:03.415 --> 33:04.616
IN A COURT OF LAW.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.684
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.353
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD
AN ATTORNEY,

33:07.386 --> 33:09.055
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED FOR YOU
BY THE STATE.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.789
WE CAN AFFORD AN ATTORNEY.
WE JUST DON'T NEED ONE.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.324
Brenda: LOOK -- BEFORE Y'ALL
START INTERRUPTING ME

33:12.358 --> 33:14.093
AND SAYING THINGS
YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET,

33:14.126 --> 33:15.627
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU, MALIN,

33:15.661 --> 33:18.197
ALL THESE SPOTS HERE
ON YOUR JEANS

33:18.230 --> 33:19.798
AND YOUR SNEAKERS --

33:19.831 --> 33:21.433
THEY'RE FROM THE BLEACH THAT
SPLASHED UP ON YOUR CLOTHES

33:21.467 --> 33:23.502
WHILE YOU WERE CLEANING BLOOD
OFF YOUR PATIO.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.704
AND...

33:25.737 --> 33:27.573
OUR LAB
SPRAYED THE GROUT

33:27.606 --> 33:29.808
BETWEEN THE TILES
ON YOUR TERRACE.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.678
AND IT TESTED POSITIVE
FOR BLOOD RESIDUE.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.546
IN A FEW DAYS,

33:34.580 --> 33:36.248
WE'LL HAVE A DNA MATCH
OF OUR VICTIM.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.384
AND TH IS ENOUGH TO ARREST
YOU BOTH FOR MURDER.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.586
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
NO.

33:40.619 --> 33:41.753
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT. WAIT.
NO, GREG.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.322
DON'T TRY TO
PROTECT ME ANYMORE.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.390
WE HAVE --
I DID IT.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.457
H-HONEY!

33:45.491 --> 33:46.458
LIKE -- NO!

33:46.492 --> 33:47.759
GREG --
NO!

33:47.793 --> 33:50.629
I HAVE TO TELL HER.
MALIN'S RIGHT, GREG.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.764
IF YOU DON'T EXPLAIN

33:52.798 --> 33:54.633
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED,
WE CANNOT HELP YOU.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.636
I-I TOLD GREG
WHEN HE CAME HOME.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.405
WE SHOULD HAVE CALLED
THE POLICE.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.273
YOU WERE ONLY
DEFENDING YOURSELF.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.342
SHE HAS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.810
LET'S PUT IT
BEHIND US, HONEY.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.146
THEY ALREADY KNOW
MOST OF THE STORY ANYWAY.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.450
LOOK --

34:11.483 --> 34:13.419
JOHN DALE --

34:13.452 --> 34:14.753
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
WATCHING US,

34:14.786 --> 34:17.723
WAITING FOR TIMES
WHEN I WOULD BE ALONE.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.694
IF ONLY WE HAD KNOWN HE WAS,
LIKE, YOU KNOW, A RAPIST!

34:22.728 --> 34:23.762
GREG, BE QUIET.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.764
I MEAN...

34:25.797 --> 34:28.500
LET ME TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED, PLEASE.
OKAY.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.170
ANYWAY,
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO,

34:31.203 --> 34:33.605
I WENT INTO
OUR BACKYARD...

34:33.639 --> 34:36.508
AND THERE HE WAS --

34:36.542 --> 34:38.610
JOHN DAVID DALE...

34:38.644 --> 34:41.147
WAITING FOR ME.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.416
AND HE -- HE TRIED...

34:45.617 --> 34:48.320
HE TRI-- HE TRIED...

34:48.354 --> 34:50.589
HE TRIED TO RAPE HER.

34:50.622 --> 34:53.559
AND ALL MALIN DID WAS,
YOU KNOW, TRY TO STOP HIM.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.161
SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.496
WHEN I GOT HOME,
MALIN WAS STILL REALLY UPSET.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.831
AND I JUST WANTED THE DUDE
OFF OUR PROPERTY,

34:59.865 --> 35:04.470
SO, YOU KNOW, SORRY
ABOUT THE ILLEGAL BURIAL,

35:04.503 --> 35:06.738
BUT IT WAS, LIKE,
VERY SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.340
REALLY?

35:08.374 --> 35:10.576
BECAUSE IT SEEMS A BIT BETTER
ORGANIZED THAN THAT.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.884
WE FOUND THIS STUFF
AT YOUR HOUSE.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.687
Gabriel: ACCORDING
TO GREG'S CREDIT CARD,

35:21.720 --> 35:23.722
HE BOUGHT THE WHEELBARROW
AND EVERYTHING IN IT

35:23.755 --> 35:26.658
THE DAY BEFORE YOU CLAIM
MR. DALE TRIED TO RAPE YOU.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.829
THE OUTDOOR BLEACH...

35:30.862 --> 35:32.498
AND, UH, THE TRASH BAGS...
BOX OF 50, 2 MISSING.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.766
...ARE THE SAME ONES
THAT MR. DALE WAS STUFFED IN.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.635
AND THE DUCT TAPE

35:36.668 --> 35:38.570
MATCHES WHAT WAS USED
TO CLOSE THE BAGS UP.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.372
AND THE
BALL PEEN HAMMER...

35:40.406 --> 35:43.642
WHICH EXACTLY FITS SEVERAL
WOUNDS ON THE VICTIM'S SKULL.

35:43.675 --> 35:44.876
I DON'T KNOW, Y'ALL.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.645
DOESN'T IT SEEM
A LITTLE COINCIDENTAL

35:46.678 --> 35:48.314
THAT ALL OF THIS
SHOULD BE HAPPENING

35:48.347 --> 35:50.549
RIGHT WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S YARD
WAS BEING DUG UP,

35:50.582 --> 35:52.651
GIVING YOU THE PERFECT PLACE
TO BURY MR. DALE?

35:54.553 --> 35:58.457
YOU'RE, LIKE, SUGGESTING THAT
WE, LIKE, MURDERED THE GUY.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.958
WHY WOULD --
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.194
MAYBE BECAUSE LIVING SO CLOSE
TO A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER

36:02.228 --> 36:03.662
MADE YOUR HOME
IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.265
EXCEPT FOR MR. DALE'S NAME
COULDN'T BE REMOVED

36:06.298 --> 36:09.201
FROM THE MEGAN'S LAW WEBSITE
UNTIL HE WAS DECLARED DEAD.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.370
AND FOR THAT, YOU NEEDED THE
BODY. AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.904
SO YOU SENT A LETTER
OF COMPLAINT

36:12.938 --> 36:14.440
TO THE CITY BUILDING INSPECTOR

36:14.473 --> 36:15.707
IN REGARDS TO
THE ILLEGAL RETAINING WALL

36:15.741 --> 36:17.209
WHERE YOU BURIED HIM.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.677
AND THEN -- POOF --
THEY DUG HIM UP.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.580
AND TH IS OUR VERSION
OF HOW MR. DALE DIED.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.650
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, GREG?
ARE WE ON THE RIGHT TRACK?

36:25.684 --> 36:26.785
NO.
WELL...

36:26.818 --> 36:27.953
NO, NO, NO.
WELL...

36:27.986 --> 36:29.421
HE TRIED TO RAPE ME,

36:29.455 --> 36:32.591
I WAS ALONE,
AND I DEFENDED MYSELF.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.461
OKAY. LET'S SEE
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.973
Provenza: LAST WEEK,
YOU ASKED YOUR GARDENERS,

36:48.006 --> 36:49.575
WHO COME TWICE A WEEK,

36:49.608 --> 36:52.411
TO TAKE AWAY THIS
PERFECTLY GOOD LAWN ORNAMENT.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.613
THEY WERE SURPRISED,
YOUR GARDENERS,

36:54.646 --> 36:57.616
BECAUSE YOU CLEANED HIM UP
BEFORE THROWING HIM OUT.

36:57.649 --> 37:01.420
TURNS OUT, THE WOUND IN THE BASE
OF OUR VICTIM'S SKULL

37:01.453 --> 37:04.856
GOES EXACTLY WITH THE TIPPY-TOP
OF THIS LITTLE GNOME'S HAT.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.692
Gabriel: YOU KNOW
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, MALIN?

37:06.725 --> 37:09.395
HONESTLY, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
STRUCK MR. DALE SEVERAL TIMES

37:09.428 --> 37:10.662
WITH THAT HAMMER,

37:10.696 --> 37:12.264
NOT REALIZING HOW HEAVY
IT WAS TO SWING.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.533
ESPECIALLY FOR A LITTLE SLIP
OF A GIRL LIKE YOU.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.035
AND WHEN YOU REALIZED
THAT MR. DALE FELL DOWN

37:17.068 --> 37:18.604
AND ONLY BROKE HIS NOSE,

37:18.637 --> 37:21.307
YOU GRABBED THE NEAREST OBJECT
YOU COULD FIND,

37:21.340 --> 37:22.508
AND SHOVED IT
INTO HIS HEAD.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.343
I WAS PANICKED...

37:24.376 --> 37:25.744
AND DEFENSELESS
AND ALONE.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.045
OKAY.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.647
IF YOU COULD SHOW ME

37:28.680 --> 37:31.350
HOW YOU PICKED UP
THAT LITTLE GARDEN GNOME

37:31.383 --> 37:32.918
ALL BY YOURSELF,

37:32.951 --> 37:34.252
THEN I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD
FOR IT.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.711
LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS.
LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS, BABE.

38:01.046 --> 38:03.915
Brenda: IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.518
I HAD TO HAVE MY HUSBAND
HELP ME WITH IT, TOO.

38:06.552 --> 38:08.887
I CAN GET IT.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.025
OH!

38:16.462 --> 38:18.096
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

38:18.129 --> 38:20.832
IS WHY YOU WENT BACK
INTO MR. DALE'S HOUSE
AND WROTE THAT E-MAIL

38:20.866 --> 38:23.869
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE JUST CALLED
AND LODGED A COMPLAINT.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.606
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT, LIKE,
RECOGNIZE OUR VOICES.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.642
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS YOUR CONFESSION.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.077
GREG, YOU IDIOT!

38:32.110 --> 38:33.812
OH! HOLD ON. WAIT.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.448
I JUST FIGURED OUT
WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE SAID.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.783
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD,

38:37.816 --> 38:39.685
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, START OUR STORY OVER?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.019
NO...

38:41.052 --> 38:43.021
BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

38:43.054 --> 38:44.556
FOR MURDER
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.495
CHIEF JOHNSON.
THE LAWYER IS HERE.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.363
THEY --
THEY CALLED A LAWYER?

38:51.397 --> 38:52.764
NO, NO.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.466
Your attorney is here.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.468
OH. OH?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.871
OKAY. UM...

38:59.905 --> 39:03.375
WELL, WE NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR GUESTS HERE FIRST,

39:03.409 --> 39:06.011
BUT, UH, BUZZ, WOULD YOU MIND
REMOVING OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.713
SURE THING, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.347
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.691
GAVIN.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.993
HELLO.
HELLO.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.995
TO WHAT DO WE OWE THE HONOR?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.565
OH, WELL,
I JUST WANTED TO DROP BY

39:26.598 --> 39:28.934
AND TELL YOU HOW GOOD IT WAS
TO MEET YOU YESTERDAY,

39:28.967 --> 39:31.703
AND HOW HONORED I AM
TO BE REPRESENTING YOU

39:31.737 --> 39:33.772
IN THIS TURELL BAYLOR
BUSINESS.

39:33.805 --> 39:34.773
OH, NO, NO.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.174
NO, NOT YET.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.578
LOOK, YOU'RE A GREAT ATTORNEY
AND ALL THAT,

39:39.611 --> 39:42.514
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA PAY YOUR FEE.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.715
THAT'S BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.684
HUH?

39:45.717 --> 39:46.685
THE RETAINER.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.688
AND YOU, CHIEF JOHNSON,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.957
YOU, PERSONALLY,
WILL NOT BE PAYING ME A DIME.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.091
I WON'T?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.493
AS LONG AS WE DON'T GO
TO TRIAL.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.528
BUT, AS WE SAY
IN MY PROFESSION,

39:56.562 --> 39:58.564
"WE'LL DOUBLE-CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE COME TO IT."

39:58.597 --> 39:59.765
AH.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.002
OH. I'M SORRY.
EXCUSE ME ONE LITTLE SECOND.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.537
SURE.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.777
I THOUGHT I SAID
NO MORE OVERTIME.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.579
OH, WILL,
THANK YOU SO MUCH

40:13.612 --> 40:15.647
FOR GETTING THE CITY
TO PAY FOR MY ATTORNEY.

40:15.681 --> 40:19.518
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME.

40:19.551 --> 40:23.088
YOU REALLY DON'T.
WELL, UH...

40:23.121 --> 40:25.223
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.192
THANK YOU SO MUCH, WILL.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.961
REALLY.
THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.997
I'M JUST...

40:32.030 --> 40:33.431
I'M GLAD IT GOT MANAGED.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.635
SO...

40:36.668 --> 40:37.869
GOOD WORK.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.005
GOOD WORK.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.114
FLIGHT RISK.

41:00.191 --> 41:03.595
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

41:03.629 --> 41:06.264
THANKS TO CHIEF POPE,
WE ARE IN BUSINESS.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.034
YEAH.
ALL THANKS TO POPE.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.702
UM
SINCE I'M HERE,

41:10.736 --> 41:12.137
WHY DON'T WE JUST,
VERY QUICKLY,

41:12.170 --> 41:13.872
ESTABLISH
SOME GROUND RULES, OKAY?

41:13.905 --> 41:15.941
OKAY.
OKAY.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.643
I THINK,
AS A GENERAL POLICY,

41:17.676 --> 41:20.045
FEWER THINGS WILL GO WRONG
IF WE ALL AGREE,

41:20.078 --> 41:21.580
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

41:21.613 --> 41:24.015
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.116
HOW ABOUT THIS?

41:25.150 --> 41:26.618
I SWEAR TO TELL
THE TRUTH,

41:26.652 --> 41:27.853
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

41:27.886 --> 41:28.887
SO HELP ME GOD.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.658
SO -- SO HELP ME GOD.
