Space to see the titan,</i>

<i>Bolo, who's been
asleep for 10,000 years.</i>

00:06.725 --> 00:09.150
<i>While there, Gary's father
tells him to go to Earth</i>

00:09.160 --> 00:10.960
<i>to find the last anti-matter bomb.</i>

00:10.995 --> 00:13.090
<i>With it, they can close Final Space.</i>

00:13.125 --> 00:15.030
<i>Let's hope there's still time.</i>

00:15.065 --> 00:16.830
Hey! Is that mustache Gary?

00:16.865 --> 00:18.765
<i>It sure is.</i>

00:21.390 --> 00:25.290
<i>Gary. The cookies
will be done in one minute.</i>

00:25.325 --> 00:30.030
Oh, good.
I'm extremely excited...

00:30.065 --> 00:33.160
for these cookies.

00:33.195 --> 00:34.895
I'm scared, H.U.E.

00:34.899 --> 00:36.064
<i> I know, Gary.</i>

00:36.065 --> 00:37.970
You'll stay with me till the end?

00:38.005 --> 00:40.900
<i>Till the very end.</i>

00:41.310 --> 00:43.710
Thank you, H.U.E.

01:19.010 --> 01:21.940
Gary, what were
your father's exact instructions?

01:21.950 --> 01:25.080
He said, "Get the Anti-Matter
bomb and close the breach."

01:25.115 --> 01:27.620
Did he say where on Earth the bomb is?

01:27.655 --> 01:30.917
In New York.
The one on Earth.

01:30.952 --> 01:31.724
That's a really big place.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.890
<i> Gary, I might be able to help.</i>

01:33.925 --> 01:36.030

<i> Big day. Took forever,

The Anti-Matter bomb.

01:49.075 --> 01:50.674
<i> What we do here
could be the difference</i>

01:50.675 --> 01:52.144
<i> between Earth's survival</i>

01:52.145 --> 01:54.510
<i> and its being swallowed up

01:54.545 --> 01:56.980
<i>Hey, John, if we survive this,</i>

01:57.015 --> 02:00.920
<i> what do you say we kick it up
with some taquitos, bro?</i>

02:00.955 --> 02:03.450
I'm going to kill him.

02:03.485 --> 02:06.520
I know where that is.
It's the Infinity Guard Spire.

02:06.555 --> 02:09.530
Then next stop ... that place!

02:18.635 --> 02:21.070
Oh, my gosh!
H.U.E., wh... what is going on?

02:21.105 --> 02:23.000
- Where are we?!
- Earth, Gary.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.610
<i>It has shifted from its coordinates
and is being sucked into the breach.</i>

02:26.645 --> 02:28.610
<i> The oceans are the first to go.</i>

02:28.645 --> 02:31.080
Oh, my God.
It's happening.

02:31.115 --> 02:33.689
I blame KVN.
Way to go, KVN. Way to go!

02:33.690 --> 02:35.089
I'm getting better!

02:35.090 --> 02:37.890
You're getting worse.
So much worse! It hurts!

02:37.925 --> 02:39.324
It hurts me physically!

I am doing great!

02:52.803 --> 02:56.380
- Oh, my God!
- That's different.

02:56.415 --> 02:58.919
- Turtles?!
- That's a little one!

02:58.920 --> 03:00.284
Dear Heavenly Lightning Lord!

03:00.285 --> 03:03.050
We're being attacked
by Ninja Sea Turtles!

03:03.085 --> 03:06.060
<i> No, Gary. But we have flown
into a school of them.</i>

03:06.095 --> 03:08.790
Good!
They're still in school.

03:08.825 --> 03:10.790
Chookity.

03:10.825 --> 03:13.995
This is so wrong.
This is very wrong.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.939
New York.

03:18.940 --> 03:21.600
<i> The planet has been
mostly abandoned, Gary.</i>

03:21.610 --> 03:25.340
Look at this place.
I've been to New York before.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.540
And this...

03:27.575 --> 03:31.080
This looks better.
Not by much.

03:31.115 --> 03:32.714
<i> Gary, uh-oh.</i>

03:32.715 --> 03:36.890
<i> You'll have six hours
to locate the Anti-Matter bomb.</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:42.020
<i> After that, all of what
you see now will be gone.</i>

03:46.030 --> 03:48.560
The Infinity Guard
betrayed the human race.

03:48.570 --> 03:51.500
They chose their side,
and we're on the other.

03:51.535 --> 03:56.440
They will show us no mercy,
so I suggest we show them none.

03:56.475 --> 03:58.570
Now let's find that bomb.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.240
I have no idea what
you're talking about, but...

04:01.250 --> 04:05.758
Count. Me. Out!
Later!

04:05.885 --> 04:07.484
<i> Gary, the S.A.M.E.S.</i>

04:07.485 --> 04:09.850
<i> have retrofitted

04:09.885 --> 04:11.790
<i> and other sundry

<i> into heinous super weapons.</i>

04:14.695 --> 04:17.190
Yes, H.U.E.!
Good lord, yes!

04:17.225 --> 04:18.694
Do you know what
that makes you?

04:18.695 --> 04:21.130
That makes you Employee
of the freaking Month.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.940
Quinn, can I ask you something?

04:26.975 --> 04:31.470
- Fire!
- Oh, my ... That came kinda fast!

04:31.480 --> 04:34.080
Take 'em out, boys!

04:34.115 --> 04:35.514
Cookity pok!

04:37.585 --> 04:42.020
Go, go, go, go!
Oh!

04:48.795 --> 04:52.230
Quinn, I still have that question.

04:52.265 --> 04:54.730
- Yeah!
- Boku!

04:58.040 --> 05:01.709
- Woop! Pah!
- Go, Mooncake!

05:01.710 --> 05:04.940
Oh, oh, yes! Yes!
Oh, my ... oh, no.

05:06.910 --> 05:10.250
Quinn! About that question.

05:10.285 --> 05:11.614
What I wanted to ask
is would you like

05:11.615 --> 05:15.050
to drink alcoholic liquids
out of a cup with me?

05:15.085 --> 05:18.050
Now?
You're asking me this now?

05:18.060 --> 05:22.150
Oh, okay, just gonna
cartwheel away from me.

05:24.530 --> 05:27.260
Okay, that was close!
Oh, my God. Ow, ohh! Oh!

05:27.295 --> 05:30.270
But just, you know,
I mean... come on, Quinn!

05:30.305 --> 05:32.330
It jus... it's just a drink.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.540
Shouldn't we be
concentrating on this?

05:34.575 --> 05:37.540
I can't concentrate on this
because all I am thinking about

05:37.575 --> 05:39.844
- is if you wanna go out with me!
- Then no.

05:42.515 --> 05:44.350
Die! Die! Die!
Why?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.880
Because I can't concentrate
on killing these guys

05:46.915 --> 05:50.020
if I'm concentrating on that!

05:50.055 --> 05:52.707
Did anyone ever tell you
emergency lighting

05:52.708 --> 05:55.394
- brings out your hotness?
- Shut up.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.074
Aah!

06:13.075 --> 06:15.640
<i> Ohhh, don't worry, Gary.
KVN can handle this.</i>

06:15.650 --> 06:17.380
KVN, don't handle this.

06:17.415 --> 06:18.884
<i> Handle this?
You got it!</i>

06:29.025 --> 06:30.624
KVN, what the freak is that?

06:30.625 --> 06:33.530
You just had a mech suit
lying around this whole time?!

06:33.565 --> 06:35.930
Yeah, so?

06:39.435 --> 06:43.000
Good lord, I hate you so feverishly.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.070
It hurts.
It physically hurts me, KVN.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.951
<i>- Hey, look, KVN!
- Hey, guys!  </i>

06:47.986 --> 06:49.750
<i> - Hey, KVN.
- You look great.</i>

06:49.785 --> 06:52.801
<i>- Hey, KVN.
- ...What? KVN, it's me ... KVN.</i>

06:52.350 --> 06:53.879
<i>- Me?
- You!</i>

06:53.880 --> 06:54.654
<i>- Hey, KVN.
- Hey, look, it's KVN.</i>

06:54.655 --> 06:56.184
<i>- Hey, KVN, you look great!
- Hi, KVN! You look great!</i>

06:56.185 --> 06:57.602
<i>- Hey, KVN, over here!
- Where?</i>

06:57.603 --> 06:59.054
<i>- Here!
- Haha!</i>

06:59.055 --> 07:02.020
Don't shoot us ... shoot them.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.885
<i>- Anything for a KVN!
- Anything for a KVN!</i>

07:04.141 --> 07:06.560
<i>- Anything for a KVN!
- Anything for a KVN!</i>

07:06.595 --> 07:10.700
- Handled!
- Gary, give him a little something.

07:10.735 --> 07:14.700
- How little?
- A thumbs up?

07:14.710 --> 07:17.110
Ugh. So much hurt.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.780
My thumb ... It's burning.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.580
Oh!

07:22.615 --> 07:24.985
We're best friends now.
Guys, do you hear this?

07:24.986 --> 07:27.354
- We're best friends now.
- We're not even friends.

07:27.355 --> 07:30.650
Right. We're best friends.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.480
<i> Gary, there isn't much time.</i>

07:34.490 --> 07:37.150
<i> Only four more hours
to locate the bomb</i>

07:37.160 --> 07:39.820
<i> before the Earth
is sucked into the breach.</i>

07:39.830 --> 07:43.064
Bomb vault, yo!
We found it, guys.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.910
It's gone. Where is it, H.U.E.?
We're running out of time.

07:55.945 --> 07:59.980
<i>Odds are that space douche  has
instructed his dickheads to hide it.</i>

08:00.015 --> 08:01.614
H.U.E., can you find it?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.084
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

08:03.085 --> 08:06.720
<i> Hmmm.
Ah. All files have been deleted.</i>

08:06.755 --> 08:10.420
<i>- Location unknown.
- Unknown?!</i>

08:10.755 --> 08:13.590
Then it's over.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.764
Drop your weapons!
Drop them now!

08:16.765 --> 08:18.800
Chookity!

08:18.835 --> 08:21.000
I mean... now it's over.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.735
I thought that ...
I thought before we were over,

08:22.765 --> 08:26.809
- but now we are all going to die.
- Get down on the floor!

08:26.810 --> 08:30.070
Not that you asked,
but this is why you're single.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.610
I didn't ask. But since you
brought it up, enlighten me.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.809
Okay, well, I actually didn't
think that far ahead, but...

08:36.820 --> 08:39.419
Look, Gary,
why do you even like me?

08:39.455 --> 08:41.820
Because you're everything I'm not.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.054
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Hell, yeah, it is.

08:45.055 --> 08:47.160
Commencing executions.

08:47.195 --> 08:50.230
Take the life form
to the Lord Commander.

08:50.265 --> 08:53.300
Just a second, guys.
Uh, look, love isn't a formula.

08:53.335 --> 08:55.970
It's messy.
It's real. It's raw.

08:56.005 --> 08:59.509
- Prepare to die, traitor.
- Then, yes.

08:59.510 --> 09:02.370
I'll drink liquids
with you out of a cup.

09:02.405 --> 09:06.580
I guess one drink can't hurt.

09:06.615 --> 09:07.884
Say goodbye.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.380
- Sorry I'm late.
- Tribore!

09:14.390 --> 09:17.590
Is it Tribore?
It is!

09:17.625 --> 09:19.094
Pachu. Pachu.

09:19.095 --> 09:21.190
Pachu. Pachu. Pachu.

09:21.225 --> 09:23.260
Take five and call me
in the morning.

09:23.295 --> 09:25.682
Hey, guy! I don't know
who you are, but I like how

09:25.683 --> 09:28.070
you keep shooting people
even after they're dead.

09:28.105 --> 09:31.670
Isn't he great?
He's so handsome.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.470
Then welcome to the Resistance.

09:33.505 --> 09:36.070
Pay attention.
He's talking.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.514
Quick, follow me.
Will it be dangerous?

09:40.515 --> 09:42.750
You bet'cha!

09:43.785 --> 09:46.854
- Chookity!
- What are you doing here?!

09:46.855 --> 09:49.490
When the Lord Commander
infiltrated the Infinity Guard,

09:49.525 --> 09:53.560
a Resistance rose up
and they needed a leader.

09:53.595 --> 09:56.290
Someone pure of spirit
and incorruptible.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.360
Only one person
met those criteria.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.652
- Tribore.
- I thought you've just been

10:03.653 --> 10:05.909
skulking around my apartment
wearing my dresses.

10:05.910 --> 10:07.309
I was in deep cover.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.970
Do I have to explain
myself to you? I don't.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.380
- Is that my scarf?
- It was.

10:12.415 --> 10:14.780
Does this Resistance
of yours happen to know

10:14.815 --> 10:18.414
- where an Anti-Matter bomb is?
- Not yet.

10:18.415 --> 10:20.980
Richard?
Hack into the mainframe.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.190
We need to find
an Anti-Matter bomb.

10:23.225 --> 10:26.090
- This way!
- This is amazing.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.790
<i>So this is the end of the world.</i>

10:28.825 --> 10:30.199
<i>I was hoping for more.</i>

10:30.200 --> 10:32.060
Richard said there
was a secret base

10:32.095 --> 10:35.735
where the bomb is being kept.
That's so Richard.

10:35.740 --> 10:38.634
Do you want to get a drink?
Oh, wait. You're busy.

10:38.635 --> 10:40.470
Why would you want
to get a drink with me?

10:40.505 --> 10:42.205
Just looking at you is enough...

10:43.540 --> 10:47.950
- ...for a lifetime.
- This is the bar where we first met!

10:47.985 --> 10:49.184
The entrance is hidden.

10:49.185 --> 10:51.550
How do I know?
I actually don't know.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.880
Come on, KVN.
I need your sensors.

10:53.890 --> 10:55.890
I have sensors?!
Hooray for KVN!

10:55.925 --> 10:58.690
Gary, I have sensors! Yay!

10:58.725 --> 11:00.425
<i>Oh, I can't believe it.
Look ... I can't believe it...</i>

11:00.430 --> 11:03.890
So, are you going to buy me
that drink or what?

11:03.900 --> 11:06.400
Hell, yeah, I am.
Pick your poison.

11:13.710 --> 11:18.487
So, I guess, I'm just saying,
this is our first date.

11:19.415 --> 11:23.450
I'm gonna die! We're
entering the meaningless void!

11:23.485 --> 11:28.120
- Cheers.
- Civilization ends now!

11:28.155 --> 11:30.990
Glass clink.

11:31.025 --> 11:33.460
Did Tribore find it?
He did!

11:33.495 --> 11:37.490
No thanks to Richard,
which, again, is so Richard.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.940
Aah!

11:46.975 --> 11:50.740
No freaking way.

11:50.775 --> 11:54.610
Five years ago I karate chopped
this man to steal his clothes.

11:54.645 --> 11:56.345
Schwa!

11:59.420 --> 12:01.150
Swallow!

12:01.185 --> 12:03.890
You're a good guy, Gary!

12:03.925 --> 12:06.160
Did not anyone help him?!

12:06.195 --> 12:09.994
- Oh, you jerk face.
- He's still alive.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.960
I gave him aspirin ...

12:11.995 --> 12:16.770
No, I gave him Crylenol.
Oh, and I overdosed him.

12:16.805 --> 12:19.170
You're not a good guy, Gary.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.770
Oh, you're such
a terrible human being!

12:21.805 --> 12:25.640
KVN, are you detecting
anything worth chatting about?

12:25.675 --> 12:27.214
Nope. Nope.

12:27.215 --> 12:31.180
Ooh, I mean yes!

12:31.215 --> 12:34.380
<i>Secret underground
bathroom base now accessible.</i>

12:34.390 --> 12:35.890
Tight!

12:36.707 --> 12:42.440
<i>Gary, there is a reinforced concrete structure
17 meters below the surface.</i>

12:42.450 --> 12:45.650
<i>Not to be a buzzkill, but the
breach's effect on the Earth</i>

12:45.685 --> 12:47.750
<i> is reaching critical mass.</i>

12:51.250 --> 12:55.125
<i>Gary, would you stop making
the face and hurry up?</i>

13:29.630 --> 13:34.030
<i> Gary, I am detecting very high
levels of Anti-Matter.</i>

13:34.065 --> 13:35.900
Tribore.
You did an okay job.

13:35.935 --> 13:38.830
It was nice work. It was!

13:38.865 --> 13:42.530
The bomb's in there.
You guys, stay back.

13:42.910 --> 13:44.640
I'm goin' in to get it.

13:44.675 --> 13:47.170
Ah, uh, aah!

13:47.180 --> 13:48.980
- Run!
- Careful, Gary!

13:55.320 --> 13:58.250
<i>Structural collapse imminent.</i>

13:58.285 --> 14:01.059
Get out!
If I get you home by nine,

14:01.060 --> 14:03.520
what are my chances of getting
some lip-to-lip action?

14:03.530 --> 14:06.790
- I'm gonna go with moderate.
- Moderate?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.200
Oh good lord,
my slacks are tightening.

14:09.235 --> 14:11.130
Settle down, Cowboy.

14:11.165 --> 14:13.170
- Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.
- Aah.

14:22.550 --> 14:24.680
- Gary ...
- What's up?

14:26.620 --> 14:28.880
This is actually
a pretty good first date.

14:34.395 --> 14:38.090
- Ugh!
- Quinn!

14:38.125 --> 14:40.490
Quinn!!

14:40.500 --> 14:43.264
Little Cato! Get this back
to the ship, Spider Cat.

14:43.265 --> 14:45.100
You got it, Thunder Bandit.

14:45.135 --> 14:48.300
<i> Gary, you do not have the
required speed to reach Quinn</i>

14:48.335 --> 14:49.909
<i> before the pressure kills her.</i>

14:49.910 --> 14:51.074
Who said it was
just going to be me?

14:51.075 --> 14:52.910
- Mooncake, double time it!
- Chokity!

14:52.945 --> 14:56.395
Chok chok chok chok
chok chok chok chok!

14:57.345 --> 14:58.414
H.U.E.! Distance.

14:58.415 --> 15:02.920
<i> 130 feet.
Approaching crush depth.</i>

15:02.955 --> 15:04.354
I can see her light.

15:04.355 --> 15:06.250
<i>I would advise you to go no further.</i>

15:06.260 --> 15:12.210
<i>Seeing as I know you won't
listen to me...  hurry.</i>

15:12.765 --> 15:14.530
H.U.E., what is this?

15:14.565 --> 15:16.330
<i>I am detecting high levels of magma</i>

15:16.365 --> 15:18.400
<i>about to break through

15:18.435 --> 15:21.294
Oh, no...

15:22.105 --> 15:25.510
Mooncake! Triple time!
Oh, no!

15:27.480 --> 15:29.180
Aah! Aah!

15:33.680 --> 15:35.620
Activate gravity boots!

16:05.720 --> 16:07.119
H.U.E.!
Where are you going?

16:07.120 --> 16:10.120
<i>Don't worry, we will not leave Gary.</i>

16:19.965 --> 16:21.930
Go, go, go, go, go, go,

16:21.965 --> 16:26.130
- Ohhh, go, go, go, go, go!
- Wa-ehhhhh ...

16:26.140 --> 16:27.504
Chokity!!

16:31.010 --> 16:34.514
It's not that impressive.

16:35.845 --> 16:41.720
Mooncake, there you are.

Where am I? I remember...
I was in the bathroom.

17:20.099 --> 17:24.160
I had zippered my pants, and then...

17:24.170 --> 17:27.501
Oh, my God! Aah!

17:27.605 --> 17:30.000
Oh God! Okay...

17:44.955 --> 17:46.655
- Where are we?
- Currently...

17:46.685 --> 17:49.990

17:56.895 --> 17:58.730
Not gonna laugh
at that one, okay. Ha.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.339
I was hoping
for a laugh there ...

18:00.340 --> 18:03.140
Would you perchance want
to join forces with me

18:03.175 --> 18:04.809
on a daily basis?

18:04.810 --> 18:07.528
I'm gonna give that
a hard "maybe."

18:07.563 --> 18:10.210
I'll take it!
Are you hearing this, Earth?

Chookity.

19:43.275 --> 19:46.570
- Hell. No.
- He is one of us.

19:46.605 --> 19:50.580
I don't really know him.
But he seems very popular.

19:52.310 --> 19:55.684
- He stays with us.
- Never.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.780

<i>The face of loss.</i>

20:06.225 --> 20:08.060
We have the Anti-Matter bomb!

20:08.095 --> 20:11.330
We will close the breach ...
you will die!

20:14.740 --> 20:17.240
I look forward to it.
