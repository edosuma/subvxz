00:04.504 --> 00:05.422
STEVE:
I can't believe Nat and Joan

00:05.505 --> 00:06.339
{\an5}are getting married.
BRANDON:
You know,

00:06.423 --> 00:08.132
{\an3}you'd think Joanie would
have a little more

00:08.216 --> 00:09.426
{\an3}recent picture of her
daughter than this.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.261
{\an1}Well, I think she does,
but they're all

00:11.344 --> 00:12.721
{\an1}packed away
in Nat's moving boxes.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.180
Oh, what a princess.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.890
{\an1}What is she,
about 22 years old now?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.183
{\an3}And a theater
and dance major.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.936
{\an5}Well, you could always
put a bag over her head.
Easy, Sanders.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.229
{\an3}This is Joanie's
daughter here.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.106
{\an3}She's a class act.
Hold the sign up, will ya?

00:23.189 --> 00:25.442
{\an1}It's up. It's up.
Attaboy.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.609
Hi.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.111
{\an3}Hello.
Hi.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.654
One of you must be Steve,

00:29.738 --> 00:31.489
and one of you must
be Brandon, right?

00:32.531 --> 00:33.742
Right.
Right.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.076
I'm Lily.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.829
{\an3}And I guess
I'm all yours.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.789
(Steve sighs happily)

00:42.542 --> 00:44.461
So, who's gonna take me
to the beach?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.463
I am dying
to go body surfing.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.922
We do have time, don't we?

00:48.006 --> 00:49.299
{\an1}Uh, I told Clare
I'd meet her

00:49.382 --> 00:50.341
at the dress shop.
(laughing)

00:50.425 --> 00:51.468
Clare...
your girlfriend?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.470
{\an3}Clare is his
girlfriend, yes.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.637
So,

00:54.721 --> 00:56.598
{\an1}I guess that leaves
you and me.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.391
{\an3}I guess
you're right.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.143
Oh, I only brought
carry-on luggage.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.270
{\an1}You know, a bikini,
shorts, tank top,

01:02.353 --> 01:03.271
{\an3}that sort
of thing.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.980
{\an1}Mom said it's been
really hot here.

01:05.063 --> 01:06.649
{\an3}Yes, it has
been hot.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.484
Hot, hot.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.778
{\an3}And getting hotter.

What, uh...

03:14.027 --> 03:16.404
what's going on?

03:16.487 --> 03:18.781
{\an1}Uh, well, uh,
Mel and Jackie are back,

03:18.865 --> 03:20.450
{\an1}so I'm done
watching the condo,

03:20.533 --> 03:22.535
{\an1}and I'm not planning
on staying in that dorm again.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.786
So, you're...
you're moving?

03:23.870 --> 03:24.621
{\an3}Where?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.289
Mark's place.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.458
Mark?! Mark Reese?

03:28.541 --> 03:29.876
{\an3}You're moving to the
Hollywood Hills?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.461
Yeah. And...?

03:31.544 --> 03:32.462
No, no, nothing.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.839
{\an3}That's great; I hear his
place is pretty cool.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.009
{\an1}Yeah, the rent's
a little steep, but, uh...

03:38.092 --> 03:41.304
{\an1}I should be okay once I get
another directing assignment.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.057
{\an3}Yeah, well, are
we still on

03:44.140 --> 03:46.017
to shoot Nat and Joan's
wedding video tomorrow?

03:46.100 --> 03:46.976
(chuckling)

03:47.060 --> 03:49.854
{\an1}Look, Donna, I-I don't do
weddings anymore.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.689
David, we agreed.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.317
Yeah, we also agreed
on a partnership, remember?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.485
Things change.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.320
Yeah, I guess so.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.821
Look, I talked to Nat,
and he understands.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.323
He's just gonna
have his cousin shoot it.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.241
No, no, I still want to do it.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.660
Fine, then talk to Nat.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.535
And-and your camera?

04:04.619 --> 04:06.204
The good one--
can I still borrow that?

04:06.287 --> 04:08.039
Yeah.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.250
Here's my address, all right?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.339
When you want it,
just come pick it up.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.384
Gee, thanks.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.056
You're welcome.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.188
{\an1}Come on, sweetheart,
you gotta eat something.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.481
Nat, I don't have

04:33.564 --> 04:35.316
room to eat-- look at me.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.193
You look beautiful.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.736
Beautiful, yeah.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.906
I've gone from Joanie
to Jonah the whale.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.533
(chuckles)
Two more weeks, hon.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.701
Just two more weeks.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.702
Hang in there.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.036
Yeah.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.329
{\an1}DONNA:
Hey, you two.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.248
Hi, Donna.
Hi.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.041
{\an1}Oh, Joan,
you look beautiful.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.334
{\an1}NAT:
See, I'm not

04:53.418 --> 04:55.211
{\an3}alone here.

04:55.294 --> 04:56.004
Oh, Nat, listen.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.047
{\an1}I have video rights
on your wedding,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.173
{\an1}so don't make
other arrangements.

04:59.257 --> 04:59.924
I'm taping it, okay?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.718
{\an3}Okay, my darling,
you got it.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.760
{\an1}Okay.
Stay well.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.554
Thank you, Donna.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.765
{\an3}Oh, I just know I'm
forgetting something here.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.475
No, Joan, don't you worry.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.560
Everything is covered.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.520
Val's ordered the champagne
and the centerpieces.

05:12.603 --> 05:13.980
Kelly's got the wedding cake.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.356
Steve's in charge
of Nat's tux.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.150
And I've got your dress.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.152
{\an3}Clare!

05:20.153 --> 05:20.820
{\an1}Hey, Steve,
where's Lily?

05:20.903 --> 05:22.238
{\an3}Brandon took her
to the hotel.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.573
{\an3}She wanted to
freshen up first.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.575
Oh, my precious angel.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.076
I can't wait to see her.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
{\an3}At least one of
my three kids

05:29.245 --> 05:30.913
could make it, though.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.248
{\an3}It was sweet
of her

05:32.331 --> 05:34.542
to take time away
from her dance company.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.335
She hates to fly, you know.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.504
How did she look?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.339
Oh, she looked <i> fine.</i>

05:43.634 --> 05:45.219
{\an3}KENNY:
Oh, this is nice.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.096
Who got you this?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.431
I treated myself.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.891
Oh, you did?
Mm-hmm.

05:49.974 --> 05:50.975
That's good.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.769
{\an3}It's good to
treat yourself.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.270
{\an1}I know.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.565
{\an1}So, can we talk
a little business now?

05:57.648 --> 05:58.983
I'm all ears.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.943
All right-- first off,

06:01.027 --> 06:03.654
I know I can get
more seating in here.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.240
And then I'm gonna
computerize the bar.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
That's good.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.786
There's no sense pouring
profits down the drain.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.954
Right.
Well, once that's done,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.373
we'll book some name acts,
do a full marketing blitz,

06:14.457 --> 06:17.502
{\an3}and then sell the
place while it's hot.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.629
Uh-uh.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.797
Uh-uh?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.507
Mm-mm.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.300
What's that in English?

06:24.383 --> 06:27.678
{\an1}Uh-uh, from the Latin "uh-uh,"
meaning "shortsighted."

06:27.762 --> 06:29.806
{\an1}I think you've got
something here, Val,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.307
a potential franchise.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.476
You're kidding, right?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.644
No, I'm not kidding.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.770
{\an1}I got an instinct
about these things;

06:35.853 --> 06:36.771
{\an1}the same instinct
that told me

06:36.854 --> 06:38.981
{\an1}to put together the Wild Wings
chicken franchise,

06:39.065 --> 06:40.817
{\an1}which went public
last year.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.985
Wild Wings--
that was you?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.445
{\an1}Mm-hmm,
you got it.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.322
{\an1}It made a lot of investors
very happy--

06:46.405 --> 06:48.449
{\an1}investors that I can go
back to with new business,

06:48.533 --> 06:49.492
maybe your business.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.870
{\an1}Why should the House of Blues
get all the action?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.872
God, you are so confident.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.000
And why shouldn't I be?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.962
{\an1}You really think
we got something here?

07:01.045 --> 07:02.505
Yes, I do.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.340
Then how do we proceed?

07:04.423 --> 07:05.967
As always in business--

07:06.050 --> 07:08.636
carefully...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.972
and discreetly.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.561
I agree.

07:24.944 --> 07:29.198
Mmm... not bad.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.200
{\an1}What more
could you want?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.744
{\an3}Well, for starters,
a shower.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.040
{\an3}Oh.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.835
(laughing):
Sorry... I'm not very modest.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.003
(chuckles)

07:42.086 --> 07:43.004
{\an3}Oh, my,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.256
he's blushing.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.843
Now he's even more adorable.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.221
I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna go
and, um, ge-get some ice

07:52.305 --> 07:53.222
or something.

07:53.306 --> 07:57.602
{\an3}Maybe you should just, uh...
kick back and relax,

07:57.685 --> 08:00.938
and if you don't like what you
see, you can always look away.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.277
What's not to like?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.867
So, uh, your mother tells me
you're a dancer.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.744
Ballet, right?

08:14.827 --> 08:16.704
Well, it's true
I was trained

08:16.787 --> 08:19.123
in the classical tradition.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.919
Are you a patron of the arts?

08:25.129 --> 08:27.882
Me? Well, uh, yeah,
I'd like to think so.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.010
(quiet, sultry laugh)

08:34.514 --> 08:35.932
JIMMY:
<i>Now, you may ask yourself:</i>

08:36.015 --> 08:39.727
is the hand really
quicker than the eye?

08:39.809 --> 08:41.812
Now, where is your heart?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.147
{\an3}Has anybody seen
Doug's heart

08:43.231 --> 08:44.273
lying around here?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.858
Huh? Show me. Where?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.112
Ah...

08:50.196 --> 08:53.241
<i>Nada!</i>
You snooze, you lose.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.041
Here, Dougie.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.295
Here it is, Dougie.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.756
Found it.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.759
{\an3}Right where
it belongs.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.181
Hal, I can finish up.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.641
You go join the others.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.935
That's all right.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.145
{\an1}No, come on,
this is my job.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.648
{\an1}You should go
enjoy yourself.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.149
Get off your feet.
You'll feel better.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.277
Hmm, will I?

09:30.569 --> 09:32.530
They say that laughter
is the best medicine.

09:32.613 --> 09:36.117
You people come and go.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.827
And I'm just going.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.711
{\an5}MARK:
<i>Listen, I'm not going</i>
<i>to press you</i>

09:46.794 --> 09:49.005
{\an1}for first, last and security
and all that stuff.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.132
{\an1}So, uh, just split everything
down the middle with me,

09:51.215 --> 09:53.175
{\an1}except for your phone bill,
and we'll be cool, okay?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.802
Thanks, man.
I really appreciate it.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.054
{\an3}No prob.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.015
I think you're going
to like it here, man.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.183
{\an3}Absolutely.
It's pretty cool, huh?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.685
Mm-hmm.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.186
{\an1}You know what
I was thinking?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.771
{\an1}We could cover
an entire month's expenses

10:05.855 --> 10:08.065
if you let me use
this as a location.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.359
{\an1}Really? I think that
can be arranged.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.112
{\an1}That is if, uh, my neighbors
can be in the video.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.615
Trust me,
they're beautiful.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.325
No problem.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
(indistinct crowd chatter)

10:21.662 --> 10:24.707
Ladies, I'd like to introduce
you to Joanie's daughter Lily.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.792
{\an3}Lily, this is Donna Martin
and Clare Arnold.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.377
{\an5}Hi.
Hi, Lily.
It's nice to meet you.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.546
{\an6}You, too. My mom went on
and on about you guys.
Hi.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.423
{\an6}Really? Have you
seen her yet?
Mom?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.591
Oh, yeah. All of her.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.093
My God, she's so big!
I can't get over it.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.805
{\an3}You guys,
this is gorgeous.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.098
Thanks.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.391
LILY: Do you guys
need any help?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.226
{\an1}Oh, yeah, sure.
The more, the merrier.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.895
{\an6}STEVE:
Clare!
What?

10:45.978 --> 10:46.937
{\an1}Where do you want this?
Leave it there.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.273
I'll be over in a sec.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.941
{\an1}Spumante?

10:51.025 --> 10:53.235
Yeah-- Val tried
for French stuff,

10:53.319 --> 10:54.779
{\an3}but Nat insisted
on bubbly

10:54.862 --> 10:56.405
from the old country.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.448
Well, it is his wedding.
You know what?

10:57.531 --> 10:59.408
{\an3}We really dropped the ball
on his bachelor party.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.868
Don't make any plans
tonight, okay?

11:00.951 --> 11:02.411
{\an3}Let's see if we can get into
some kind of debauchery.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.872
{\an1}Can't; I'm babysitting
the maid of honor.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.082
Oh.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.084
{\an3}STEVE:
Tough job.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.211
{\an3}BRANDON:
Yeah.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.004
So what's her
story, anyway?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.756
I'll let you know.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.924
What's <i> your</i> story?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.634
I'll let you know that, too.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.927
{\an3}(lilting)
Sh... ah!

11:18.010 --> 11:19.220
(laughs)

11:19.303 --> 11:20.596
What are you
looking at?

11:20.679 --> 11:22.056
The canopy.
The canopy.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.808
{\an6}Hmm.
Clare, you did
a stellar job.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.059
{\an1}It looks great.
Mm-hmm.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.018
It's beautiful.
Thanks. Hmm.

11:26.102 --> 11:26.936
{\an3}It's about
the closest

11:27.019 --> 11:29.105
{\an3}you'll ever see me
come to getting married.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.940
{\an3}What does
that mean?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.942
Just what I said.

11:33.025 --> 11:33.984
I'm never getting married.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.403
Oh, get out of here.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.654
If you insist.
(clears throat)

11:36.737 --> 11:38.030
Very clever, Arnold.

11:38.114 --> 11:38.989
I know what this is.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.783
You're using
your reverse feminine psychology

11:40.866 --> 11:42.076
on me, aren't you?

11:42.159 --> 11:43.953
{\an1}What?!
Oh, please.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.204
If you say
you're never getting married,

11:45.287 --> 11:46.705
you think
that I'm gonna feel challenged

11:46.789 --> 11:48.666
and change my mind about
never wanting to get married.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.667
{\an1}That's it,
isn't it?

11:49.750 --> 11:50.668
Oh, you feel the same way?

11:50.751 --> 11:51.919
I didn't say that.

11:52.002 --> 11:52.920
Well, what are you saying then?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.964
I'm just saying
never say never; that's all.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.632
Boy, you're really
throwing me a curve, Clare.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.467
I don't get
what the big deal is.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.635
Are we getting married
tomorrow?

11:59.718 --> 12:02.138
{\an3}No.
Well, then... (snorts)

12:03.389 --> 12:04.849
And there she goes.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.517
{\an1}Nice, huh?
(sighs)

12:06.600 --> 12:07.852
{\an1}Go figure.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.605
{\an3}Eh, my advice is,
give her... 25 years.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.776
{\an3}(grunts)

12:17.027 --> 12:20.197
(indistinct crowd chatter,
seagull cawing)

12:20.281 --> 12:21.949
{\an1}Okay, these are the rest
of the centerpieces.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.951
{\an1}They need to be refrigerated,
so, can you put them

12:24.034 --> 12:25.119
{\an1}with the champagne
for the wedding party?

12:25.202 --> 12:26.120
{\an1}Sure.
Great. Thanks.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.204
Mm-hmm.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.177
(speaking quietly)

12:41.260 --> 12:42.511
Kenny, hi.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.846
{\an3}Hello.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.473
Hi. I'm Valerie Malone.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.223
You must be Diane.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.850
I'm your husband's
new client.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.101
{\an1}Hello.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.519
Jim Walsh sent
her over to me.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.313
{\an3}She owns the Peach
Pit After Dark.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.189
{\an1}DIANE:
Oh! Oh, right.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.231
That nightclub on Pico.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.567
Correction. The Money Pit.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.361
Although Kenny's given the place
a new lease on life.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.071
{\an1}We're already talking
about a franchise.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.323
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.866
Really?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.534
He's been a savior.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.162
Well, he does love his work.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.041
{\an1}And I just love
your tennis bracelet.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.710
{\an1}Thank you.
Beautiful.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.504
Your son's adorable.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.758
{\an1}Michael?
Here we go again.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.552
{\an1}Boys-- you've got
to watch them all the time.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.553
Nice meeting you.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.639
It was lovely
to meet you.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.603
Well, you guys look cozy.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.230
What are you doing, Valerie?

13:34.313 --> 13:37.066
What? We don't have
anything to hide, do we?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.237
{\an1}You guys just
go ahead and...

13:41.320 --> 13:42.863
do your thing.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.413
{\an6}MAN:
Throw it over here!
Hey, Donna.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.249
{\an3}How's it going?
Hey, Mark.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.043
Hey, I didn't see you come in.
Hi.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.795
Hey.
Sorry, I...

13:57.878 --> 13:59.922
guess I should have
called first.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.549
Uh, yeah.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.925
Ah, hey, here you go.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.510
Oh, thanks.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.471
Looks like you've made
yourself at home.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.597
Yeah, right?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.307
(chuckles)

14:11.850 --> 14:13.060
Here you go.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.062
Wouldn't want to erase
all your fun and games.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.065
Huh. Thanks.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.317
Here.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.612
Well, guess I'll, uh,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.531
see you tomorrow
at the wedding.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.839
(indistinct chatter)

14:47.177 --> 14:48.304
Can I get you anything?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.139
{\an3}You mean, besides
a conscience?

14:50.222 --> 14:51.849
What?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.476
{\an3}I never seem to play
this game without cheating.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.145
Why is that?

14:56.228 --> 14:59.481
{\an3}In the end, it always
catches up with you, anyway.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.150
So I noticed
Hal was his usual

15:01.233 --> 15:03.027
charming self
with you this morning.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.154
I guess I was out of line.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.989
I'd argue that.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.324
I can't really blame him.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.117
I'm not in his shoes,
you know?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.368
But you're here,

15:11.452 --> 15:12.620
a volunteer.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.288
{\an3}You know, I'm sure
you had a slew

15:14.371 --> 15:15.664
{\an3}of field electives
to choose from.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.875
What prompted you
to pick a death house?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.877
"A death house"?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.670
That's a little harsh.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.590
Obviously your sense of humor
hasn't sunk as low as mine.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.301
You were saying?

15:27.384 --> 15:30.471
Why did I come here?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.681
{\an1}Well, I've asked
myself that

15:32.765 --> 15:35.351
over a hundred times.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.353
{\an1}But, uh, well,
at first,

15:37.436 --> 15:39.146
I thought it must be
out of some

15:39.229 --> 15:41.023
insidious need
to punish myself.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.066
For what?

15:42.149 --> 15:44.652
Past sins.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.363
Ah... punishing God complex.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.531
Right.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.575
But then, things sort
of flip-flopped,

15:51.659 --> 15:55.371
and, uh... I don't know...

15:55.454 --> 15:56.872
Somehow I thought that
working here

15:56.955 --> 15:58.666
could be life-affirming.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.877
To be honest with you,

16:01.960 --> 16:03.087
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.672
May I make a suggestion?

16:04.755 --> 16:06.507
Stop rationalizing it.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.217
Just do the gig
for course credit.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.468
Simple enough?

16:09.551 --> 16:12.179
{\an3}Yeah.
Try to keep it simple

16:12.262 --> 16:13.722
with the residents
around here, too.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.890
Don't coddle them.

16:14.973 --> 16:18.394
Just, uh,
do what needs to be done

16:18.477 --> 16:19.561
and be mindful.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.398
Mindful. Right.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.858
{\an3}Look at us.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.235
You're dusting

16:26.318 --> 16:28.362
and I'm waxing
philosophical.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.780
How about a game

16:29.863 --> 16:32.366
{\an3}of gin rummy?
Sure.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.575
(watch beeping)

16:33.659 --> 16:35.869
(sighs)

16:35.953 --> 16:37.746
Medication time.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.959
{\an3}Let's see what's on the
menu today, shall we?

16:42.042 --> 16:45.337
The usual mix:
antiretrovirals,

16:45.421 --> 16:46.755
painkillers,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.925
antidepressants and-- aha!

16:50.008 --> 16:52.177
My favorite.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.096
Trimethoprim.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.764
Yummy.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.183
You know, I have to say,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.352
you look a lot healthier

17:00.436 --> 17:01.729
than the rest
of the people here.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.107
Just another one of my marvelous
illusions, love.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.567
How far down the road are you?

17:06.650 --> 17:08.277
Some nights,
I actually see

17:08.359 --> 17:09.819
the light at the end
of the tunnel.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.281
Cut the cards.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.825
Let's deal.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.377
♪ ♪

17:31.008 --> 17:33.427
{\an5}BRANDON:
This is where
your friend works, huh?
Yep.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.636
Wow!

17:34.720 --> 17:35.929
Look at this place.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.640
{\an3}They only hire the
cream of the crop here.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.642
Come on.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.978
Thyra said she was
dancing on the main floor.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.855
Hold on a second.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.815
You're not a ballerina,
are you?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.359
Well, let's put it this way:

17:49.443 --> 17:50.944
I've never danced Swan Lake,

17:51.028 --> 17:53.655
but I'm pulling in five grand
a month as Tiger Lily.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.073
"Tiger Lily"?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.325
Let me guess.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.035
Your mother has no idea.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.495
Not a clue,
and I'd appreciate it

17:59.578 --> 18:01.747
if you would keep it
between us.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.502
Come on,
let me buy you a drink.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.712
All righty.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.758
Not bad, is she?

18:12.841 --> 18:14.676
Ah, no.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.805
Maybe I can pick
up a few moves.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.098
Come on, let's get out of here.
What?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.892
(sighs)

18:21.975 --> 18:23.310
Too late, we're busted.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.236
{\an3}This wasn't your idea, okay?
Brandon.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.946
{\an3}Just let me
do the talking.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.533
{\an1}NAT:
Brando! This is, uh,

18:37.616 --> 18:40.202
the last place I expected
to run into you two.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.162
{\an3}Hi, Nat.
Small world, huh?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.372
Pretty small.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.706
{\an3}I thought this would
be a great place

18:44.790 --> 18:46.375
{\an3}to bring the bachelor
for his last night out.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.043
Good choice.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.378
Don't worry about it, Nat.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.630
{\an1}If I were a guy,
I'd take you here myself.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.925
{\an4}WOMAN:
Lily?
Thyra!

18:55.008 --> 18:56.552
Oh, my God!
You came!

18:56.635 --> 18:57.219
{\an3}I can't believe it!
(squealing)

18:57.302 --> 19:00.055
LILY:
You look beautiful.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.099
Are you going
to work here?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.226
{\an3}'Cause you know they're
hiring now with full

19:04.309 --> 19:05.394
medical.
Really?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.938
Yes!
Whoo!

19:08.021 --> 19:09.398
Did she say "work"?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.566
Did she?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.401
Oh, boy.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.738
(knocking)
Enter.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.408
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be finished.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.368
Mm...!

19:21.451 --> 19:23.245
Looking for something?

19:23.328 --> 19:25.539
Aha, there you are.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.417
My third eye.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.752
{\an3}Damn thing keeps
disappearing.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
{\an3}It's got a mind
of its own, you know.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.797
Ha-ha.

19:33.881 --> 19:34.840
Are you finished?

19:34.923 --> 19:36.341
Patience.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.635
My condition requires
that I take small bites,

19:38.719 --> 19:41.138
and that I chew each one
36 times.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.598
Just like Mother told me.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.600
Are you coming by tomorrow?

19:44.683 --> 19:46.768
No, I'm going to a wedding.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.979
I love weddings.
Give me details.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.272
Well...

19:50.355 --> 19:52.232
it's some older friends,

19:52.316 --> 19:55.110
{\an1}Nat Bussichio
and Joan Diamond.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.069
She owns a lamp store.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.572
He owns the Peach Pit Cafe
in Beverly Hills.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.115
Good pie.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.366
Yes.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.409
How'd they meet?

20:02.492 --> 20:05.579
On some B-movie set

20:05.662 --> 20:07.623
over 25 years ago.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.832
They ended up breaking up.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.083
Her parents didn't approve,

20:10.167 --> 20:12.294
he being Italian,
and she being Jewish.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.171
Being Jewish
and having been to Italy,

20:14.254 --> 20:16.256
I can assure you,
there are Italian Jews.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.259
Sorry. Go on.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.846
Well, last year, some friends
of mine reunited them.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.808
And, as it turns out,
after all these years,

20:26.892 --> 20:29.227
they still carry a torch
for each other.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.604
Oh.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.189
Now they're getting married
and she's having

20:32.272 --> 20:33.649
a baby in a couple of weeks.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.026
Mazel tov.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.319
That's incredible.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.820
Yeah.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.280
I was married once.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.157
{\an6}Really?
Well, don't look
so surprised.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.743
I'm a very old-fashioned guy,
Kelly.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.245
Magic and monogamy,
always been my strong suits.

20:48.747 --> 20:52.501
Anyway, he was a...

20:52.584 --> 20:54.169
he was a wonderful man.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.545
Tell me about him.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.381
I will.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.882
(clears throat)

20:58.966 --> 21:00.300
I will.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.677
Some other time.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.053
Right now,
I'd love a cup of tea.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.389
Sure.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.356
You know what?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.858
I have a feeling
we're gonna be good friends.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.027
I'm sure.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.904
Lifelong pals.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.667
Well, Tiger Lily,

21:33.750 --> 21:36.461
{\an1}thanks for, um,
an interesting evening.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.046
Thank you for the company.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.922
You're welcome.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.508
Do you think that
Nat will tell my mother?

21:41.591 --> 21:42.884
It's doubtful.

21:44.302 --> 21:45.929
Then he'd have to explain
how he found out, see?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.139
{\an3}(groans)

21:47.222 --> 21:48.682
God, he's already
sounding married.

21:48.765 --> 21:49.808
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.396
Tell me something.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.232
I don't understand.

21:57.315 --> 21:59.735
You're obviously not ashamed
of what you do,

21:59.818 --> 22:02.738
so why don't you just come clean
with your mother about it?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.073
{\an6}She seems like a pretty
cool lady to me.
Well, you don't know

22:05.157 --> 22:06.074
my mother.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.200
I mean, in her eyes,

22:07.284 --> 22:08.577
I'm still her precious
little angel

22:08.660 --> 22:10.412
and she doesn't
want to let go of that.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.040
{\an3}Besides, now is
not the right time

22:13.123 --> 22:14.291
to tell her,
with the wedding

22:14.374 --> 22:15.751
and the baby coming and all.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.211
Nah, I guess you're right.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.214
Ah, good night.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.051
Brandon.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.803
{\an3}You know, most guys,
when they find out

22:26.887 --> 22:29.097
{\an3}that their date
is an exotic dancer,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.433
{\an3}the horns come out,
and suddenly,

22:31.516 --> 22:33.560
{\an3}they have all these
expectations.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.937
But not you.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.608
{\an3}No. You would <i> never</i>
expect <i> anything.</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:41.777
{\an1}No. Never.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.948
{\an3}That's why we're really
going to enjoy this.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.957
(birds singing)

22:56.041 --> 22:57.042
(groans)

22:57.125 --> 22:58.502
{\an6}VALERIE:
Hey.
(grunts)

22:58.585 --> 22:59.836
Is Clare up?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.588
Oh, I don't know.

23:01.671 --> 23:04.007
{\an3}Well, is Clare
even here?

23:04.091 --> 23:05.384
No. That I do know.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.177
Well, I thought
she was gonna stay here

23:07.260 --> 23:09.596
'cause Joan was gonna stay over
at the beach apartment.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.807
Yeah, that was the plan.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.350
You know, Clare's proving

23:13.433 --> 23:15.602
to be very unpredictable
these days.

23:15.685 --> 23:16.812
{\an4}Yeah?
Let me ask you
something.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.271
Does she seem like
the kind of woman

23:18.355 --> 23:19.856
that would never get married?

23:19.940 --> 23:20.982
Well, I don't know.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.151
I mean, those things are kind of
unpredictable, you know?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.986
Mm. Sorry I asked.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.488
Mm.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.781
Are we grumpy this morning?

23:27.864 --> 23:29.991
No, we're in detox, okay?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.660
Aspirin.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.121
Bright light! Oh!

23:34.204 --> 23:35.497
{\an1}(whimpering):
Aspirin...!

23:35.580 --> 23:36.998
You know,
Brandon didn't come home

23:37.082 --> 23:38.291
{\an3}last night.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.584
Oh, really.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.961
Yeah. Wasn't
he supposed

23:41.044 --> 23:43.004
to be squiring Joan's daughter
around last night?

23:43.088 --> 23:44.339
Squiring.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.049
Now there's a good word.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.304
Have you called David yet?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.556
(door opening)

23:52.639 --> 23:53.723
You will.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.892
Okay, well...

23:55.976 --> 23:58.854
Okay. Good-bye.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.647
How bad is it?

24:00.730 --> 24:02.357
Oh, no.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.776
It's just, uh, MZA just
officially dropped our contract.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.986
Oh.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.112
{\an3}Oh, I'm
sorry.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.697
(sighs)

24:08.780 --> 24:10.699
Ah, I'm fine-- it's just...
it's David I'm worried about.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.742
I don't know
how he's going to take this.

24:12.826 --> 24:13.368
{\an3}CLARE:
David's

24:13.451 --> 24:14.202
a big boy.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.537
He can take care of himself.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.872
Besides, gotta
get organized here.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.373
Yeah, do you think
we should wake up Joan?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.041
No, I think
we should let her sleep.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.668
I mean,
she has a big, big day ahead.

24:21.751 --> 24:22.669
{\an4}Mm-hmm.
KELLY:
All right.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.004
I am gonna
go to the bakery

24:24.087 --> 24:25.672
{\an1}Okay, and...
and check on the cake.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.757
I'm gonna go pick up some blank
videotapes and I'll stop by

24:27.841 --> 24:29.384
the beach club and make sure
everything's set up.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.178
All right-- wait-- I thought
Valerie was doing that.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.555
Yeah, she is;
I... I just give her a hand.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.056
Unless, of course,
you'd like to.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.099
No.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.809
Yeah.

24:37.893 --> 24:38.894
(chuckles)

24:40.979 --> 24:42.022
Hey, Bran, wait up.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.236
He shows up for work
on his wedding day.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.279
What's with his guy?

24:49.362 --> 24:50.405
{\an3}Never mind that.
God!

24:50.488 --> 24:51.865
Tell me about last
night, my friend.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.074
What about last night?

24:53.158 --> 24:53.950
{\an3}What about
last night?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.619
{\an3}You were supposed
to be at Casa Walsh.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.620
You weren't there.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.246
{\an3}And I assume you were
still baby-sitting Lily.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.873
{\an1}I don't know
what to tell you.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.917
{\an1}It's all kind of a blur,
if you know what I'm saying.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.877
{\an3}A blur! I love a blur!
Can you be more specific?

25:03.960 --> 25:04.878
{\an1}What's with
the third degree?

25:04.961 --> 25:06.421
Well, I just am
concerned, Bran.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.506
{\an3}I noticed
you're limping.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.136
(laughing)

25:16.473 --> 25:18.225
Nat?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.976
Get him out
of here, will you?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.311
Nat?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.898
{\an1}Nat, come on.
It's time to go.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.942
Nat?

25:27.025 --> 25:27.984
{\an3}Come on, don't--
back off.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.070
{\an3}I got... I got... I got
three orders up here.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.446
{\an1}BRANDON:
Nat, Nat, Nat, Nat!

25:31.529 --> 25:32.948
{\an1}Nat, listen to me,
listen to me.

25:33.031 --> 25:33.949
Work time is over.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.116
Now it's time

25:35.200 --> 25:36.618
to get married.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.911
Now, put down

25:37.994 --> 25:39.287
the spatula, Nat.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.580
{\an1}Nat,

25:40.664 --> 25:41.957
just put down the...

25:42.040 --> 25:43.625
(Nat groans)
I got it!

25:43.708 --> 25:44.668
Willie, take over!

25:44.751 --> 25:45.919
{\an1}Sure can.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.295
No problem.
Willie!

25:47.379 --> 25:49.339
Wait till you see the tux
I got for you.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.592
Willie, table six wants their
egg sandwich toasted on wheat.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.511
(grunting)

26:03.561 --> 26:04.604
CLARE:
<i>Hmm.</i>

26:04.688 --> 26:06.314
{\an1}I don't know
about the pearls.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.109
They're nice, but they kind of
look a little Queen Elizabeth-y.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.277
(laughter)

26:10.360 --> 26:11.319
I agree.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.654
What about
Grandma's necklace?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.155
Yes, that would work.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.532
{\an3}Where is it? I'll get it.
It's in my bag.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.658
Thank you, Clare.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.784
No problem.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.328
(sighs)
Oh!

26:20.412 --> 26:25.000
{\an1}I'm so glad Nat agreed
to a short ceremony.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.668
Nat seems like an agreeable man.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.128
You like him, don't you?

26:28.211 --> 26:29.379
{\an3}Mom,

26:29.462 --> 26:30.422
he's great.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.133
In fact, I had a long talk
with him last night.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.009
You did?

26:34.092 --> 26:35.468
About what?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.470
Oh, about life...

26:37.554 --> 26:38.972
dancing...

26:39.055 --> 26:40.015
to your own beat.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.141
Choices.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.226
And you've made
a good one, Mom.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.521
You're following your heart,
and that's all that matters.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.026
{\an1}What do you think
about her hair?

26:51.109 --> 26:54.029
Hmm. I don't know.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.363
I-I kind of like
it the way it is.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.531
{\an3}Maybe we should just
comb it out a bit?

26:56.614 --> 26:57.991
Oh, the floral!

26:58.074 --> 26:59.034
The headpiece. Right.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.702
I knew something was missing.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.580
{\an3}It's in the fridge.
I'll get it.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.624
{\an3}It's times like this
I miss my own mom.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.921
{\an1}Nat told me
that you lost her

27:12.005 --> 27:15.133
{\an1}when you were, what,
in-in your early teens?

27:15.216 --> 27:17.052
{\an1}Yeah.
Oh.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.970
(sighs)

27:19.054 --> 27:20.096
It's funny.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.767
She used to make such a big deal
about my wedding day.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.311
Like it would be some kind
of fairy tale.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.563
She even wanted me
to marry a prince,

27:28.646 --> 27:30.940
{\an3}but...

27:31.024 --> 27:32.984
I could never do it, you know?

27:33.068 --> 27:35.737
Not without my mom.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.697
Clare, do you think
your mom would want

27:37.781 --> 27:39.366
to deny you a moment like this?

27:39.449 --> 27:43.078
No... it's not that.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.082
{\an1}JOAN:
I wouldn't be surprised

27:47.165 --> 27:49.084
if she's...

27:49.167 --> 27:52.587
looking down at you right now,
with my mom...

27:53.630 --> 27:55.590
...wishing you all the love
in the world.

27:55.673 --> 27:57.634
Maybe.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.344
Thanks.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.471
Come on.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.098
We're late,
we're late

28:03.181 --> 28:05.725
{\an1}for a very
important date.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.935
Oh.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.062
It looks great.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.773
(crowd chatter)

28:11.856 --> 28:13.233
{\an3}It's a good day
for a wedding, huh?

28:13.316 --> 28:14.275
Yeah. Hey.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.819
{\an1}Hey, guys.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.112
Hi.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.238
{\an1}Looking dashing, boys,
looking dashing.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.447
{\an1}You know Lily.
Sure.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.241
{\an6}DAVID:
Mm-hmm.
Hi.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.326
See you guys.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.631
{\an1}Joan's daughter
is pretty striking, huh?

28:36.714 --> 28:38.133
Hey, Deedee, how are you?

28:38.216 --> 28:39.134
Willie, this is Lily.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.301
{\an1}This is Joan's
daughter.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.470
{\an3}Yes, she's
very beautiful.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.889
{\an1}She and Brandon have been
getting along.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.102
{\an1}You know he didn't
come home last night.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.187
{\an3}(scoffs)

28:53.398 --> 28:55.108
{\an3}DAVID:
Hey, Donna.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.486
Hi.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.863
Got some bad news

28:59.946 --> 29:01.823
this afternoon.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.159
MZA dropped me.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.286
Guess I'm officially a wannabe.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.663
Yeah, they called me
this morning.

29:08.746 --> 29:10.373
They called you first?

29:10.457 --> 29:12.041
(scoffs)

29:12.125 --> 29:13.042
Come on, David.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.544
What difference does it make?

29:14.627 --> 29:16.671
None. None, I guess.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.176
{\an1}Well, would it help
if I said I was sorry?

29:21.259 --> 29:24.012
{\an1}That I know how much
it meant to you?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.014
Ah, it's no big deal.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.892
I mean, it's not like they're
the only game in town, right?

29:29.934 --> 29:32.187
Well, whatever.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.563
You're on your own now.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.148
Good luck.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.068
Thanks.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.071
Ooh, there he is.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.035
{\an3}Will everyone gather
round, please?

29:47.118 --> 29:48.995
We're about to begin.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.040
{\an1}Can we call a truce
for today?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.167
No truce necessary.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.506
You look beautiful.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.384
{\an3}You don't look
so bad yourself.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.720
Dear friends,
we are gathered here

30:05.803 --> 30:07.764
to bear witness to the union

30:07.847 --> 30:10.892
of Joan and Nat.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.352
Their being here

30:12.435 --> 30:16.064
is a testament to love's
enduring grace and power.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.691
Its miraculous ability

30:18.775 --> 30:21.528
to transcend time
and circumstance,

30:21.611 --> 30:23.404
and its divine insistence

30:23.488 --> 30:26.407
on seeking its rightful destiny.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.868
Nat and Joan's love

30:28.952 --> 30:31.037
has come full circle,

30:31.120 --> 30:34.457
never to be broken again.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.960
And that is what
we celebrate here today.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.795
{\an3}(gasping)
Mom?

30:38.878 --> 30:40.088
{\an1}God!
What? What is it?

30:40.171 --> 30:41.714
My water just broke.
What?!

30:41.798 --> 30:44.217
{\an3}That means the baby's
coming right now!

30:44.300 --> 30:45.426
What do we do?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.929
We gotta get her
to a hospital, huh?

30:49.889 --> 30:51.057
MAN:
Coming through!

30:51.140 --> 30:52.267
We need a fetal monitor!

30:52.350 --> 30:53.977
(Joan whimpers)
She's crowning.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.395
Contractions are
coming on strong.

30:55.478 --> 30:56.646
{\an1}We don't have time
to get her into a room.

30:56.729 --> 30:57.939
Let's get her straight
into delivery.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.441
Stop! Stop!

31:00.525 --> 31:01.776
I can't...

31:01.859 --> 31:03.403
I-I won't have this baby

31:03.486 --> 31:05.947
until I'm a married woman.

31:06.030 --> 31:06.990
Excuse me.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.783
{\an1}Ooh! Ooh.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.785
Nat Bussichio,
do you take Joan

31:10.868 --> 31:12.495
{\an3}to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

31:13.705 --> 31:14.789
I do.

31:14.872 --> 31:15.873
{\an1}OFFICIAL:
Joan Louise Diamond,

31:15.957 --> 31:19.252
{\an3}do you take Nat to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

31:19.335 --> 31:21.796
Ooh. I sure do.

31:21.879 --> 31:23.673
{\an4}OFFICIAL:
The rings. The rings.
BRANDON: The rings!

31:23.756 --> 31:24.966
I have the rings.

31:25.049 --> 31:25.967
(laughs)

31:26.050 --> 31:27.552
Yes...

31:28.970 --> 31:30.930
Let this ring be a sign

31:31.014 --> 31:34.100
of my fidelity and love.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.607
My heart...

31:42.775 --> 31:44.694
...for your heart

31:44.777 --> 31:47.322
forever.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.990
{\an4}(Joan whimpers)
OFFICIAL:
By the power vested

31:49.073 --> 31:50.783
in me by the state
of California,

31:50.867 --> 31:52.535
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.995
You may kiss the bride.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.581
(applause)

32:07.091 --> 32:09.010
Made it, Joanie.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.345
All the way back.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.180
And then some.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.181
(chuckles)

32:13.264 --> 32:14.390
(yelling)

32:14.474 --> 32:16.517
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

32:16.601 --> 32:18.645
(Joan yelling)

32:20.229 --> 32:21.814
MAN:
Come on, folks.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.900
(Joan yelling)

32:34.327 --> 32:36.037
Oh, this is funny.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.581
We're having a wedding reception
in a hospital.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.625
Cake's good.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.544
{\an1}CLARE:
Think it's fat-free?

32:43.628 --> 32:45.546
You have to ask?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.465
Thanks.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.760
{\an1}KELLY:
Well, Joan's daughter seems

32:50.843 --> 32:52.887
to be moving quickly.

32:54.430 --> 32:57.016
{\an1}Well, I think Joan's
real proud of her, though.

32:58.142 --> 33:04.565
{\an3}I want you to know
I'm not promiscuous.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.235
Now, what would ever
make me think that?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.904
Champagne?

33:10.863 --> 33:12.407
It's a boy.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.826
(all cheering)

33:14.909 --> 33:16.536
NAT:
Have a cigar.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.079
But don't light it up
in here.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.580
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey,
so what's his name?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.040
How about Steve?

33:21.124 --> 33:23.918
No, it's Francesco,
after my father's father,

33:24.001 --> 33:25.253
but you can call him
Frankie.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.046
Well, that'll be easier.
Yeah.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.756
{\an3}Ah, is this a great
day or what?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.258
So, when do we get to see him?

33:30.341 --> 33:31.759
{\an3}Yeah, when can Mom
have visitors?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.761
Uh, well, she and the baby
are in the recovery room.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.763
{\an3}I'll check on 'em
in a bit and, uh...

33:35.847 --> 33:37.432
Ah, to hell with it,
give me a drink.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.725
(laughter)

33:38.808 --> 33:41.310
Ah, listen, everybody...

33:41.394 --> 33:43.771
uh, I don't know
where to begin here.

33:43.855 --> 33:44.605
Uh, this has been...

33:44.689 --> 33:48.276
today has been
a little overwhelming.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.652
{\an1}Whew.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.738
25 years ago...

33:51.821 --> 33:53.948
...I gave up the idea

33:54.031 --> 33:57.493
of ever having a wife
and children to come home to,

33:57.577 --> 33:59.912
{\an3}and as the
years went on,

33:59.996 --> 34:04.041
I got down to believing
that I was going to die alone.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.085
{\an1}But now I know
that God sent you guys

34:06.169 --> 34:09.088
to be my guardian angels

34:09.172 --> 34:11.966
because you brought Joanie
back to me,

34:12.049 --> 34:16.429
and now I have a wife, a son,

34:16.512 --> 34:18.431
{\an3}a family.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.934
The circle of life and love
is complete.

34:23.936 --> 34:24.978
{\an1}(voice breaking)
You guys will always be

34:25.062 --> 34:26.813
<i>la familia</i> to me.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.775
I love you all
so very much.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.235
<i>Salud,</i> thanks.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.655
{\an6}STEVE:
Salud!
Salud.

34:35.697 --> 34:37.992
(glass clinking,
people whooping)

34:38.076 --> 34:39.327
{\an1}NAT:
Thank you, baby, thanks.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.329
Here, Willie,
have a cigar.

34:41.411 --> 34:42.621
You want a cigar?

34:42.705 --> 34:44.165
Yeah...
Here-- you got one, too!

34:44.248 --> 34:46.833
Whew!

34:46.918 --> 34:49.295
{\an1}So, uh, now can I
call you Papa?

34:49.378 --> 34:50.170
(chuckles)

34:50.254 --> 34:52.380
{\an3}Sure, if I can call
you Tiger Lily.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.674
{\an1}(laughs)

34:53.757 --> 34:55.134
{\an3}STEVE:
Clare, wait up.

34:55.217 --> 34:56.302
I gotta go, okay?

34:56.385 --> 34:57.553
{\an3}Hey, you don't
have to go.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.847
{\an3}We need to talk;
come here.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.933
Come here...

35:05.144 --> 35:07.063
{\an3}Listen...

35:07.146 --> 35:08.856
I know weddings
can sometimes be

35:08.940 --> 35:11.984
emotional twisters.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.528
For me, they always

35:13.611 --> 35:17.865
dredge up these buried feelings
about my parents' divorce.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.202
Bad feelings.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.707
You know, the kind
that just don't go away.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.669
I know.

35:29.752 --> 35:30.670
(sobbing)

35:30.753 --> 35:33.714
The whole time...

35:33.798 --> 35:38.010
I'm thinking my mom's gone.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.888
She's never going
to see me get married,

35:40.972 --> 35:43.850
so forget about it.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.393
I know it's stupid.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.645
Hey, no, no,

35:47.728 --> 35:49.730
it's not stupid.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.524
I understand.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.900
It's fear, you know.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.735
(sniffles)

35:54.819 --> 35:55.611
I'm just afraid

35:55.695 --> 36:00.700
that if I really
let myself love someone,

36:00.783 --> 36:02.702
I'll just end up losing them.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.121
Like you lost your mom.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.122
{\an1}Yeah.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.583
(sighs)

36:08.666 --> 36:13.421
But after listening
to Nat in there...

36:13.504 --> 36:17.758
I guess you just have
to let love lead you.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.929
Otherwise,
you'll end up alone, right?

36:22.013 --> 36:25.224
That's what I love
about you, Clare.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.976
You're so logical.

36:27.059 --> 36:30.062
(wry laugh)

36:30.146 --> 36:32.231
What do you say
we just let...

36:32.315 --> 36:35.693
{\an3}we just let
love lead us?

36:35.776 --> 36:38.029
Lead on.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.581
{\an1}So, Lily, maybe we should, uh,
do this again some time.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.207
Shh, Brandon.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.626
(moans)

36:51.709 --> 36:53.461
It was a delicious weekend.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.005
{\an1}Mm-hmm, it certainly was,
but, uh....

36:56.088 --> 36:58.466
But that doesn't mean that we
should pursue a relationship,

36:58.549 --> 37:00.551
{\an3}does it?

37:00.635 --> 37:01.469
No, it doesn't.
(laughs)

37:01.552 --> 37:04.639
Obviously, we have
terrific chemistry.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.140
Obviously.

37:06.223 --> 37:08.017
{\an3}Let me tell
you a secret.

37:08.100 --> 37:12.146
{\an3}I was married once, for
about three glorious weeks,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.065
and it did not suit me.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.858
Maybe when I'm
my mother's age

37:15.942 --> 37:19.528
I'll reconsider, but, for now,
I prefer being a free spirit.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.322
And that you are.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.617
So if you ever make
it to Cleveland...

37:24.700 --> 37:26.702
{\an1}Yeah, and if you ever get
back to L.A.--

37:26.786 --> 37:28.329
(both moaning)

37:28.412 --> 37:30.498
(giggling)

37:35.544 --> 37:38.172
Or Arizona, Utah, Colorado,

37:38.255 --> 37:40.841
even Manitoba would work for me.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.404
(whispering):
Hello.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.615
(chuckles)

38:04.699 --> 38:06.575
Hi.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.743
{\an1}What, you don't like
surprises?

38:07.827 --> 38:08.869
(sighs)

38:08.953 --> 38:10.705
{\an3}Well, I'd like a
little advance notice.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.581
You're trouble.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.916
And you're playing games.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.710
Games?

38:18.963 --> 38:21.048
{\an1}Are you or are you not
getting a divorce?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.467
{\an3}I am getting--
Val, I am.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.011
{\an3}I am getting
a divorce,

38:25.094 --> 38:26.345
but it just makes

38:26.429 --> 38:27.680
good fiscal sense

38:27.763 --> 38:30.516
not to give Diane
any ammunition beforehand,

38:30.599 --> 38:31.559
if you know what I mean.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.394
Yeah, I know what you mean.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.895
Good.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.439
So, what are you doing here?

38:36.522 --> 38:38.524
Uh... came by to look
at your books again.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.276
I want to look
at last year's P and L

38:40.359 --> 38:43.112
and write up
an investors' prospectus.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.238
Well, we went over this.

38:44.321 --> 38:45.239
I sent you copies.

38:45.322 --> 38:46.240
Didn't you get them?

38:46.323 --> 38:48.409
Yeah, I got 'em.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.369
I got just about
everything I need.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.162
(chuckles)

38:51.245 --> 38:52.580
Well, so what are
you doing here?

38:52.663 --> 38:54.415
Um...

38:54.498 --> 38:55.541
What?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.963
{\an3}I...

39:02.006 --> 39:04.175
I am falling in love
with you, Val.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.391
BRANDON:
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

39:12.475 --> 39:14.810
I apologize for my tardiness.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.604
{\an1}Hey, bud.
Hi.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.732
Oh, that's, that's, uh,
that's, that's nice.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.733
Thanks, Silver.

39:20.816 --> 39:23.110
{\an3}DAVID:
Yeah, sure.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.111
Where's Nat and Joan?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.905
{\an4}Oh, they went
to get the baby.
Oh.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.081
{\an1}Hey.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.959
{\an1}I can take over for you,
if you want me to.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.294
{\an3}That's all right;
I'm fine.

39:41.378 --> 39:43.923
(sighs)

39:47.384 --> 39:51.639
I've been really on edge lately,
with this whole MZA thing.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.769
I don't know up
from down anymore.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.856
Well, just know one thing.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.399
I'm not the enemy.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.237
Yeah, I know.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.700
{\an1}I feel kind of weird
being here.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.828
{\an1}It's kind of like I'm looking
into a crystal ball

40:13.911 --> 40:15.621
at my future
or something.

40:15.704 --> 40:16.664
{\an1}Why? What's going on,
big fella?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.541
{\an1}You thinking about settling
down, having a family?

40:18.624 --> 40:20.668
{\an3}Hey, come on, I don't
even have a diploma yet.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.837
{\an1}Well, all right--
first things first.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.838
What about you?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.548
I don't have my diploma either.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.299
You ever think
about having a family?

40:27.383 --> 40:32.847
Sure, sure, I guess.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.974
I mean, why are we all here,

40:35.057 --> 40:38.686
unless we find love
and pass it on?

40:38.769 --> 40:40.855
Exactly.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.982
Hey, you know, that's a really
beautiful thought, Brandon.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.024
Will you marry me?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.359
Now, I know it's
a big decision,

40:45.442 --> 40:46.861
{\an3}but you can
take your time.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.864
Don't you touch me.
Oh, what, not even a hug?

40:49.947 --> 40:51.657
Hey, look.

40:51.740 --> 40:54.827
(Donna and Steve gasp)

40:56.495 --> 40:57.663
(mouthing words)

40:59.665 --> 41:02.001
{\an3}Ladies and gentlemen,
the Bussichios.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.377
Look, he's even got
Nat's nose.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.503
And Joanie's eyes.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.471
Hey, Frankie.
Welcome to the world.

41:17.683 --> 41:18.726
{\an3}DAVID:
Right on!

41:18.809 --> 41:20.811
High five!
Yeah! Yeah!

41:24.315 --> 41:26.650
There's cake,
if anybody wants some.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.326
Hal says thank you, Kelly.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.715
So, how was
the wedding?

41:49.798 --> 41:52.301
Full of surprises.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.595
The bride's water broke.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.430
She had a baby.

41:56.513 --> 41:59.391
{\an3}A birthday and an anniversary
all rolled into one.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.228
{\an1}Lovely.
(chuckles)

42:02.311 --> 42:05.439
Did you bring a date?

42:05.522 --> 42:06.565
{\an1}No.

42:06.649 --> 42:07.858
No?

42:07.942 --> 42:08.776
Why not?

42:08.859 --> 42:11.111
Because I'm not dating.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.113
It's no big deal.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.449
All my friends were there
anyway.

42:15.532 --> 42:18.410
Old friends, old enemies.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.954
And which old friend
and which old enemy

42:20.037 --> 42:22.289
has you singing the blues?

42:22.373 --> 42:24.625
{\an1}Are you a magician
or a psychic?

42:24.708 --> 42:28.128
{\an3}Aren't they
the same thing?

42:28.212 --> 42:31.966
{\an1}Well, the best man,
Brandon...

42:32.049 --> 42:34.468
{\an1}(sighs)

42:34.551 --> 42:35.928
He's someone that--

42:36.011 --> 42:39.473
well, things just never
came together for us,

42:39.556 --> 42:41.934
and I know we're in completely
different orbits and everything,

42:42.017 --> 42:44.353
but seeing him
with the maid of honor

42:44.436 --> 42:46.605
hanging all over him
at the reception...

42:46.689 --> 42:47.606
{\an3}Oh...

42:47.690 --> 42:48.649
the best man, maid of honor.

42:48.732 --> 42:49.650
Say no more.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.277
Happens every time.

42:53.612 --> 42:56.323
It got to you, huh?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.325
It was just obvious
that there was

42:58.409 --> 43:00.494
something going on between them.

43:00.577 --> 43:04.331
A point which Valerie made sure
I was aware of.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.332
And who is Valerie?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.334
(dish clanking)

43:07.418 --> 43:08.502
Valerie is a bitch.

43:08.585 --> 43:10.129
(laughs)

43:10.212 --> 43:13.173
{\an3}There's usually
one in every crowd.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.717
{\an3}Question:

43:14.800 --> 43:16.343
{\an3}who are you more
upset with--

43:16.427 --> 43:19.471
Brandon, the best
man, your friend,

43:19.555 --> 43:20.848
or that bitch Valerie?

43:20.931 --> 43:23.183
Valerie.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.019
You let her win
when you let her get to you.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.103
You know that?

43:28.564 --> 43:30.524
Listen to me.

43:30.607 --> 43:32.359
At all costs,

43:32.443 --> 43:35.070
avoid melancholy.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.196
It's an insidious trap.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.324
I can't think
of anything worse.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.076
Except AIDS,

43:41.160 --> 43:43.996
{\an3}of course.

43:44.079 --> 43:47.207
Start loving yourself.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.711
Start loving life.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.338
It's fleeting enough.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.131
Yes, it is, isn't it?
