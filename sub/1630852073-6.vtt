00:00.800 --> 00:02.401
<i>[Amy] Previously on...
1000-lb Sisters.</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:03.969
[Michael speaking]

00:03.971 --> 00:04.837
[Tammy speaking]

00:04.839 --> 00:05.871
[Michael] Yep.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.239
[Amy speaking]

00:12.746 --> 00:13.612
Here's what I need from you.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.813
I need you below 400.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.549
I got four weeks to get
under 400 pounds

00:17.551 --> 00:18.584
<i>or I don't get approved
for surgery.</i>

00:18.586 --> 00:20.919
You hit that number
and we're good to go.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.821
<i>[Chris] There's always that little
voice in the back of your head,</i>

00:22.823 --> 00:24.690
"Are you gonna make it?"

00:24.692 --> 00:26.959
[Misty] So what's going on
with you and Phillip?

00:26.961 --> 00:28.927
You have such a [bleep] attitude

00:28.929 --> 00:30.963
since you got with him.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.967
I think the boyfriend's
a hindrance.

00:34.969 --> 00:40.172
On the internet, I was reading that he
doesn't want her to get below 300 pounds...

00:40.940 --> 00:42.307
[Tisa] Yes, you can.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.842
[bleep]

00:43.844 --> 00:48.914
What I want Tammy to do is just try
to walk 10 feet from where we was at.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.817
Now, I cannot push you
in that wheelchair like that

00:51.819 --> 00:53.419
and hurt myself,

00:53.421 --> 00:56.321
because I know
that you can walk.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.290
That's just [bleep]

01:14.140 --> 01:16.141
[Darlene speaking]

01:17.877 --> 01:19.078
[Tammy speaking]

01:23.883 --> 01:25.918
[Tammy speaking]

01:34.194 --> 01:36.228
When's your next appointment
with the doctor?

01:37.697 --> 01:39.331
And Chris is gonna go with you
out there too?

02:01.788 --> 02:05.190
Maybe it might be part of
my fault, and it probably is.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.174
Are you still serious
about having the surgery?

02:24.177 --> 02:25.377
Huh?

02:27.881 --> 02:29.114
[Tammy speaking]

02:56.109 --> 02:58.010
[Darlene] So, how's Tisa?

02:58.211 --> 02:59.378
[Tammy speaking] Good.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.072
Okay.

03:27.139 --> 03:28.941
[Tammy speaking]

03:54.133 --> 03:57.069
Yes, took my pain pill.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.704
[knocking at door]

03:58.706 --> 04:00.072
[Tammy speaking]

04:01.174 --> 04:03.141
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

04:06.479 --> 04:07.779
This is my mom.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.848
-Hi.
-Your mom? Wow, hey! How are you doing?

04:09.850 --> 04:12.017
- Honey, I'm blessed.
- [Tammy chuckles]

04:12.019 --> 04:15.921
<i>[Tisa] This is the first time seeing
Tammy after that spat that we had.</i>

04:15.923 --> 04:18.457
I would like an apology
from Tammy

04:18.459 --> 04:21.860
<i>but I don't know
if that's gonna happen.</i>

04:21.862 --> 04:25.764
I used to be a nurse, I worked
in the pelvic room at Job Corps

04:25.766 --> 04:27.399
and we had to
the test tubes and all,

04:27.401 --> 04:29.835
see if they had gonorrhea
or something like that.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.937
Oh, you got a tough job!

04:31.939 --> 04:35.941
No, it wasn't bad until this girl
came in and had this funny smell,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.410
and I turned around
and looked at the doctor

04:38.412 --> 04:41.179
and he pulled a $20 bill
out of that girl.

04:43.516 --> 04:44.749
Yeah!

04:44.751 --> 04:47.386
- [Tisa exclaims] - Honey,
you don't think we didn't clean--

04:47.388 --> 04:49.588
Girl, why'd she have
a $20 bill in her coochie for?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.989
I didn't ask no questions.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.091
I just got the heck
out of Dodge.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.893
Darlene...

04:54.895 --> 04:57.095
Have you ever...?

04:57.730 --> 05:01.166
She never did tell me why
she had it in her coochie.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.369
[Tisa laughs]
Tammy, she ain't right.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.839
[Tammy speaking]

05:07.841 --> 05:12.344
It's, like, one of the only
memories she tells. [laughs]

05:17.517 --> 05:19.051
How's it going with y'all?

05:23.856 --> 05:26.258
What all happened
when y'all went swimming?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.294
[Tisa] Well, hell...

05:29.762 --> 05:31.763
I said, "Well, Tammy,
let's just walk

05:31.765 --> 05:34.599
'cause I don't think I can
push you on the concrete."

05:34.601 --> 05:38.737
And she said, "No, that ain't
gonna work. I'm just not gonna do it."

05:38.739 --> 05:40.605
But she can walk!
I know damn well she can walk.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.942
- [Darlene] Yeah.
- Walk good!

05:43.944 --> 05:49.781
To push Tammy is just like you're
working two 12-hour shifts back-to-back.

05:49.783 --> 05:54.986
<i>You know, I want her to get to have
her surgery, like how she wants it,</i>

05:54.988 --> 05:57.689
but she's gonna have to give it,

05:57.691 --> 05:59.424
to get it is not gonna be free.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.160
<i>And she can do it.</i>

06:03.062 --> 06:04.296
<i>I know she can.</i>

06:04.897 --> 06:06.164
[Darlene speaking]

06:08.201 --> 06:10.168
[Tammy speaking]

06:20.146 --> 06:21.413
Well, I didn't know.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.182
[Tammy speaking]

06:33.393 --> 06:35.394
<i>So for me to tell Tisa,</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:45.570
is a big step for me,

06:45.572 --> 06:48.840
Like, I don't tell
people [bleep].

06:48.842 --> 06:51.510
I had no idea that you was
in any kind of pain.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.944
I hide it.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.947
I don't want people to know
how weak I am.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.019
Well, I'm about to cry.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.522
I'm sorry,
I should have told you.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.057
- I'm sorry.
- I had no idea.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.862
- I still love you.
- I still love you, too.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.030
[giggles]

07:12.598 --> 07:14.166
I do.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.535
<i>How am I supposed to know
if she's feeling bad?</i>

07:16.537 --> 07:18.403
<i>She needed to tell me, you know,</i>

07:18.405 --> 07:21.106
'cause I'm thinking that
she just don't wanna do it.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.709
And if you don't tell me,
I'm gonna keep pushing you

07:24.711 --> 07:28.680
<i>till you give me
a legitimate reason why.</i>

07:28.682 --> 07:30.715
<i>But I don't want her
to use that as excuse</i>

07:30.717 --> 07:32.017
every time when
she ain't in pain

07:32.019 --> 07:33.418
to tell me she is in pain.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.554
That's the thing.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.723
I told her, that right there ain't
gonna be her permanent spot

07:38.725 --> 07:40.692
sitting in that damn
wheelchair right there.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.929
Well, Ms. Darlene,
what do you think I can do

07:43.931 --> 07:46.932
to try to get her more
motivated about that walking?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.201
Just get off my back about it.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.271
[Darlene speaking]

08:02.014 --> 08:04.049
[voice breaking]
It's very important.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.404
[Amy speaking]

08:26.406 --> 08:28.373
Let's go over here
and play with some bubbles.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.544
I heard through the grapevine

08:32.546 --> 08:36.081
that Tammy and Tisa got into it,

08:36.083 --> 08:39.951
<i>but I'm glad Tammy finally
apologized for being so rude to her</i>

08:39.953 --> 08:42.854
<i>'cause I can't go back
to working with Tammy.</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:44.356
<i>I need this time for my family.</i>

08:45.124 --> 08:46.391
Yeah!

08:47.093 --> 08:48.426
You like the bubbles?

08:50.930 --> 08:52.230
[Michael speaking]

08:52.465 --> 08:54.099
[Amy speaking]

09:06.746 --> 09:10.115
And I'm like, "That reminds
me so much of Tammy."

09:10.383 --> 09:12.250
He eats more than I do.

09:13.452 --> 09:18.957
And it's scary because I don't
want him to be 600 pounds.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.334
<i>[Amy speaking] My son means
the whole world to me,</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:30.702
so I want what's best for him.

09:30.704 --> 09:34.139
I don't want him to struggle like
me and Tammy did with our weight.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.142
I want him to be
a normal, healthy weight

09:37.144 --> 09:41.146
so he ain't never gotta worry about the
bullies in school or anything like that.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.950
You know, sometimes
when we go places, like,

09:45.184 --> 09:46.985
to the park or something...

09:50.556 --> 09:51.723
Yeah.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.159
<i>[Amy] I've been working hard
to get this weight off.</i>

09:54.161 --> 09:56.895
<i>Last time I weighed myself
a few months ago,</i>

09:56.897 --> 09:58.597
<i>I was about 260.</i>

09:58.599 --> 10:00.865
My ultimate goal is 150.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.801
<i>But now it's hard
to lose weight.</i>

10:02.803 --> 10:05.070
<i>There's so much excess skin,</i>

10:05.072 --> 10:07.706
<i>and it does make it harder
for walking,</i>

10:07.740 --> 10:10.442
so my weight is plateauing.

10:18.217 --> 10:22.320
- Yeah...
- You know, to me it's ugly, the way it looks, it's like...

10:23.856 --> 10:25.223
Yeah.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.827
It makes me feel unattractive.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.664
I just don't feel sexy
with all this skin.

10:32.666 --> 10:37.135
<i>I mean, I felt more confident
when I was 400 pounds</i>

10:46.846 --> 10:48.947
I've actually been doing
research for a while now

10:48.949 --> 10:52.050
and I found a place
in Evansville

10:52.052 --> 10:55.420
that you know
could probably help me.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.925
Well, first I wanna get this

11:00.927 --> 11:02.327
and then this.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.130
If I get all that trimmed up,

11:08.534 --> 11:10.235
And then all this.

11:11.837 --> 11:16.107
- Yeah.
- Because I ain't no grandma yet.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.866
[Misty] I don't think
we're gonna fit through there.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.168
If you turn...

11:43.170 --> 11:44.936
I'm sorry.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.671
Ow! [bleep]

11:46.673 --> 11:48.239
That [bleep] thing's prickly.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.226
When you go in the door,
go to the left.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.130
Do you wanna sit in your chair
or on the couch in there?

12:13.199 --> 12:14.665
Okay.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.670
<i>I don't think Tammy thinks
this is gonna help her very much.</i>

12:18.672 --> 12:21.940
I think the only reason why
Tammy is going to see the therapist

12:21.942 --> 12:25.176
<i>is she has to do it
to be cleared for surgery.</i>

12:25.178 --> 12:26.945
She doesn't really wanna go.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.347
- [Tammy pants]
- [Dr. Hansen] Hi, Tammy.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.953
Okay, where do you
wanna go with it?

12:34.955 --> 12:37.021
Okay, you just walk out,
I got it.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.256
Well, it's not locked.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.225
[Misty] Okay.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.994
[Tammy gasps and coughs]

12:42.996 --> 12:45.997
Tammy, can you close that door?

12:52.872 --> 12:54.305
This wasn't [bleep] thought out.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.213
Um...

13:02.215 --> 13:04.716
I'm gonna have to close
the door, okay?

13:04.718 --> 13:06.684
What I'm telling you is
I gotta catch my breath

13:06.686 --> 13:08.419
before I can stand back up.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.659
<i>[Amy] Today, me and Michael
are going to see</i>

13:14.661 --> 13:17.862
about getting
skin removal surgery.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.765
As you can see, the volume
reduction gives a new jawline.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.067
[Amy speaking]

13:29.408 --> 13:32.644
Let's find out what this
number is and then we'll talk.

13:32.646 --> 13:36.314
If Dr. Smith turns me down
from having the surgery...

13:42.888 --> 13:45.156
[Dr. Hansen] I'm gonna have
to close the door, okay?

14:09.081 --> 14:10.715
<i>It's complete [bleep].</i>

14:10.717 --> 14:12.383
<i>I'm ready to go home.</i>

14:12.385 --> 14:16.020
If you can just move this
over here just a little bit,

14:16.022 --> 14:18.089
'cause she's not
gonna sit on there.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.358
There we go, yeah. Perfect.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.161
That way maybe
we can move her in.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.778
<i>So, our first time meeting is
typically what we call an intake session</i>

14:40.780 --> 14:43.414
<i>and it's really more like a Q&A.</i>

14:43.416 --> 14:47.285
It's an opportunity for me
to just ask her some questions

14:47.287 --> 14:49.721
and get to know her
a little bit,

14:49.723 --> 14:53.124
<i>and to understand the reason why
she struggles with food addiction.</i>

14:53.459 --> 14:55.059
I really want to connect,

14:55.061 --> 14:56.861
I really want to establish
a rapport with her.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.897
All right.
Good morning, Tammy.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.266
Welcome, thank you
for showing up today.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.235
Tell me what brings you
to therapy.

15:06.939 --> 15:10.108
Okay. So when did it start?

15:12.478 --> 15:13.912
[Dr. Hansen] Okay.

15:13.914 --> 15:19.784
Do you tend to eat more,
like, maybe in the evenings?

15:19.786 --> 15:22.420
Do you tend to eat more
when you're bored?

15:26.825 --> 15:28.293
[Dr. Hansen] Okay, okay.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.365
Tammy, how do you feel
when you eat?

15:40.839 --> 15:42.807
You look like
you're scowling at me.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.375
Like you don't want to be here.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.083
How are you feeling
right now, Tammy?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.120
I don't know what that means.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.789
[Dr. Hansen] Okay, okay.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.060
I do need you to kinda answer
some questions for me, all right?

16:02.528 --> 16:04.996
Okay. I'm not saying
you haven't.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.966
I'm just saying I need you to
be a little bit more cooperative

16:07.968 --> 16:09.968
if that's possible, okay?

16:13.405 --> 16:14.739
Well, a lot of times,

16:14.741 --> 16:18.476
when I deal with individuals who
have some type of an addiction,

16:18.478 --> 16:22.914
often it's because they're
struggling with something internally

16:22.916 --> 16:27.151
and that's the best coping
that they can find at that time.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.420
Maybe you've used food

16:29.422 --> 16:32.256
to kinda cope with some stuff
that you're struggling with.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.596
<i>My first impression is that
Tammy is very reserved.</i>

16:38.598 --> 16:44.002
My goal for Tammy is
for her to accept,

16:45.971 --> 16:51.009
validate, acknowledge her reasons
for eating more than what she should.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.012
<i>She knows the reasons,</i>

16:54.014 --> 16:56.814
but she's afraid to tell me.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.617
She's afraid
to tell herself the reasons.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.054
Tammy, in general,
how is your mood?

17:13.399 --> 17:16.934
Okay. How about becoming
easily annoyed or irritable?

17:16.936 --> 17:19.070
[laughs]

17:20.406 --> 17:23.074
- Why are you laughing.
- [continues laughing]

17:25.978 --> 17:28.312
- Because it's true?
- [continues laughing]

17:29.648 --> 17:32.417
Okay. So, what are
some weaknesses?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.185
Some things that you can
kinda work on?

17:36.422 --> 17:38.956
Confidence. Do you struggle
a lot with that?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.324
Yeah, okay.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.961
Are you nervous that people
are gonna judge you and...

17:55.808 --> 17:58.109
Okay. That's a great attitude,

17:58.111 --> 18:02.146
but sometimes it's harder
to practice that, right?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.982
Excellent, okay.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.823
Yeah.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.891
Okay, believing
in yourself, yeah.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.927
That's really hard work,
isn't it? Yeah, okay.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.129
What is your goal?

18:20.365 --> 18:24.102
Okay. Is that something that
you think you could probably do it?

18:24.104 --> 18:27.038
Or are you like, "Gosh, that's a huge
mountain, I'm not sure I could climb"?

18:27.806 --> 18:29.140
You can do it? Okay.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.377
I'm not hearing a lot
of confidence in that.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.347
[mumbles]

18:36.349 --> 18:39.183
Tammy, what are your thoughts
about the session thus far?,

18:42.654 --> 18:44.188
Okay. I don't know
what that means,

18:44.190 --> 18:46.257
so you're gonna have to
verbalize it.

18:46.259 --> 18:50.128
Okay. There's no thoughts about
the things that we talked about today?

18:51.497 --> 18:52.797
Okay...

18:52.799 --> 18:58.102
I never want to force
anyone into therapy.

18:58.104 --> 19:01.973
What are your thoughts, Tammy,
about maybe coming back to see me?

19:02.274 --> 19:04.942
- I guess.
- Okay, okay.

19:04.944 --> 19:09.180
I'm not sensing a lot of motivation
or commitment on your part.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.182
What are your thoughts
as you hear me say that?

19:17.789 --> 19:21.759
'Cause, as I was listening
to you and kinda watching you,

19:21.761 --> 19:23.828
I wasn't getting a lot
of information from you.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.429
As our session progressed--

19:26.598 --> 19:28.633
Exactly. And I was
just gonna say,

19:28.635 --> 19:31.536
as our session progressed,
you did open up a little bit.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.738
I think underneath
all of the stuff,

19:33.740 --> 19:36.174
I think there's somebody
who's really hurt.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.144
That's just my impression
right now.

19:55.928 --> 20:00.097
[Dr. Hansen] So, can you talk to me a
little bit more about this food addiction?

20:04.336 --> 20:05.703
<i>Tammy shut down.</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:09.006
I think she has a lot of
things that she wants to say,

20:09.008 --> 20:13.411
but she is finding it hard
to trust somebody to share

20:13.413 --> 20:15.246
some of her deep secrets with.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.250
Okay, yeah.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.511
Are we walking every day?

20:47.513 --> 20:48.613
- No.
- No.

20:48.615 --> 20:52.717
Today is Chris and I's
follow-up appointment.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.052
[Dr. Smith] All the things we
asked you to do, you didn't do.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.988
It kinda ticks me off.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.432
[Amy speaking]

21:11.570 --> 21:14.839
So, today me and Michael are
going to a plastic surgeon's office

21:14.841 --> 21:18.843
to see about getting
skin removal surgery.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.411
<i>It really affects my confidence</i>

21:20.413 --> 21:21.812
<i>because my belly hangs over.</i>

21:21.814 --> 21:24.048
[Julie] Hello!

21:24.050 --> 21:25.416
<i>[Amy speaking] You know what
a droopy dog is?</i>

21:31.623 --> 21:33.157
Yeah.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.630
All right, guys. So, I'm
going to get you ready

21:39.632 --> 21:41.899
for your chat with Doctor Zieg.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.734
First of all,
you and I need to discover

21:43.736 --> 21:47.171
exactly what changes
you're looking to do.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.315
- All right. Well, we have a solution for that.
- And right here.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.784
We're gonna do
a virtual image of your face,

21:59.786 --> 22:02.887
- and I'm gonna show you the changes that we can make.
- Okay.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.655
Go ahead and stand
in front of this machine.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.992
Now scoot forward one inch.

22:10.629 --> 22:14.365
No, an inch is, like, this
big, okay? So here we go.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.369
And you can go and have a seat.

22:20.272 --> 22:24.241
- So, here we go.
<i>- [Amy] Oh, my God. I'm ugly.</i>

22:29.481 --> 22:32.550
Let's start with the chin because
that's everybody's major concern.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.553
- Mmm-hmm.
- We'll let Dr. Zieg make all the decisions,

22:35.555 --> 22:39.423
but probably starting with just
some liposuction and skin tightening.

22:39.425 --> 22:44.862
As you can see here, the volume
reduction gives a new jawline.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.163
[Amy] Yeah.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.735
So we're gonna
soften this line here.

22:50.737 --> 22:54.138
It's not gonna be completely gone
because that would be awkward

22:54.140 --> 22:57.308
but it's gonna be
less noticeable. And then...

22:58.043 --> 22:59.877
[Julie laughs]

22:59.879 --> 23:01.245
We have the magic.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.095
Hello?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.900
- I'm Paul Zieg.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Amy.

23:22.902 --> 23:23.567
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Michael.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.003
Hi, Michael.

23:27.739 --> 23:32.643
-So, you had a gastric bypass a
couple of years ago, -[Amy] 2019.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.880
- And lost about 140 pounds?
- [Amy] Yeah.

23:35.882 --> 23:40.151
So, let me see your arm,
if I can.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.622
Want you to, kind of,
make a muscle for me.

23:44.624 --> 23:50.761
I'm going to say that's
probably about five pounds of fat.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.596
- If you can lay back for me for a moment.
- Can I pull this down?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.298
Yeah, you can.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.403
- So do you get rashes in the summertime?
- [Amy] Yeah.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.939
- Right here?
- Especially now that I've lost all the weight.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.375
- Yeah.
- It wasn't as bad as before.

24:04.377 --> 24:05.910
[Dr. Zieg]
That's a very common problem.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.947
<i>[Amy] He examined every
part of me. My boobs, my necks,</i>

24:21.526 --> 24:28.866
So, what I find is that folks search
me out after they get to their goal.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.435
[Dr. Zieg] It would probably
be best for us to focus on

24:31.437 --> 24:35.840
waiting to see
how things go for you.

24:35.842 --> 24:40.444
<i>My suggestions for Amy is
continue on her weight loss journey.</i>

24:40.446 --> 24:42.613
Her body will
still have changes.

24:42.615 --> 24:48.586
After she's done with that then we
can proceed with having the surgery.

24:48.588 --> 24:52.056
I've been down this road with
folks, kind of, hitting a brick wall.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.891
- And things just aren't...
- Yeah. It's kind of...

24:53.893 --> 24:55.926
[Dr. Zieg] Budging anymore.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.262
And they get kind of frustrated.

25:04.803 --> 25:08.572
<i>[Amy] It's hard because,
after my weight loss surgery,</i>

25:08.574 --> 25:12.309
for the first year I dropped
weight like it was nothing.

25:12.311 --> 25:15.713
But now it's, like,
hard to lose a pound.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.415
While it's not an immediate
gratification to get what you want,

25:18.683 --> 25:20.985
the results are nicer.

25:23.388 --> 25:26.957
- It's not a sprint, it's a
marathon. [laughs] - [Amy] Oh.

25:30.595 --> 25:35.165
My next steps are to, you
know, lose more weight because

25:51.816 --> 25:54.084
<i>[Chris] My sister's got this
crazy-ass idea</i>

25:54.086 --> 25:56.420
to go to the spa.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.364
Oh, God.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.068
I might have a problem.

26:12.871 --> 26:15.139
She doesn't...

26:16.708 --> 26:19.209
- There we go. Got it.
- Okay. I got it now.

26:21.112 --> 26:23.948
- That's definitely a small spot.
- [Tammy laughs]

26:23.950 --> 26:26.150
[Chris speaking]

26:26.152 --> 26:28.185
Hey, y'all. It's Amy.

26:29.821 --> 26:30.821
Hey, it's Tammy.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.956
[Amy] And...

26:31.958 --> 26:34.224
- Me.
- [all laughing]

26:34.226 --> 26:36.694
Putting up
with these two [bleep].

26:36.696 --> 26:40.364
In a couple of days, Chris
has his doctor's appointment

26:40.366 --> 26:43.400
to see if he's gonna
get approved for surgery.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.737
And if he gets approved he's
gonna get his surgery the next day.

26:46.739 --> 26:50.140
Dude, he's got this,
so it's just nice to go out

26:50.142 --> 26:52.176
and just let loose
for a little bit

26:52.811 --> 26:54.211
[Amy speaking]

26:56.648 --> 26:58.082
[Tammy speaking]

27:03.655 --> 27:05.756
We have a esthetician coming in,

27:05.758 --> 27:09.326
and we're doing facials and

27:15.867 --> 27:19.269
<i>[Chris] It is relaxing,
so I'm not going to sit there</i>

27:19.271 --> 27:21.405
and say that I didn't enjoy it.

27:21.407 --> 27:26.243
I'm just saying I'm glad they're paying
for it because I'm not paying for it.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.414
So, we are doing
a belly wax today?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.951
- Yep.
- Okay.

27:33.953 --> 27:38.422
I figured, you know, just want a
little strip because, God willing,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.858
if I get my surgery
there is gonna be

27:40.860 --> 27:43.861
four incisions
across my stomach.

27:43.863 --> 27:47.998
So they've talked me into
getting that area waxed.

27:52.904 --> 27:56.940
- Oh, golly, that's gonna hurt like hell.
- [all laughing]

27:56.942 --> 28:00.944
- All right, are you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.814
All right.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.049
[Esthetician] One...

28:05.051 --> 28:05.816
[Esthetician] Two...

28:05.818 --> 28:07.785
Three.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.352
- Oh, that wasn't even that bad.
- That wasn't.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.289
- That wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
- [Estheticians laugh]

28:16.728 --> 28:20.264
No, it didn't really hurt as bad
as I expected it to, you know?

28:23.802 --> 28:27.104
- I don't know how women survive.
- [laughs]

28:31.576 --> 28:33.310
[Chris speaking]

28:42.821 --> 28:45.656
I don't know
what this is called, but hey.

28:45.658 --> 28:48.058
I really want to
prove to Tammy that I'm here,

28:48.060 --> 28:51.028
I'm showing her support,
we're working out together.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.229
- Ow.
- [laughs]

28:52.231 --> 28:53.397
Oh.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.266
Oh, God.

28:58.303 --> 29:01.071
[Dr. Smith]
Let's get on the scale.

29:02.607 --> 29:07.077
I'm angry with the fact that she did
not do anything that I asked her to do.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.246
<i>I just really feel like
she's wasting her time.</i>

29:25.730 --> 29:27.631
[Tammy speaking]

29:27.633 --> 29:31.435
I haven't been doing what
Doctor Smith's been asking me.

29:31.437 --> 29:36.240
<i>So now I'm trying to get this
weight loss taken care of because</i>

29:56.861 --> 30:00.831
<i>[Amy speaking] Tammy has a doctor's
appointment with Doctor Smith coming up,</i>

30:00.833 --> 30:03.167
so I really want to prove
to Tammy that I'm here,

30:03.169 --> 30:04.835
I'm showing her support.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.104
<i>I'm right here,
we're working out together.</i>

30:07.839 --> 30:09.239
<i>But, in reality,</i>

30:15.113 --> 30:16.246
Like this.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.248
Okay.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.326
- Ow.
- [laughs]

30:32.831 --> 30:34.031
Oh.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.300
Oh, God.

30:40.104 --> 30:44.341
It seems like Amy has forgotten
everything she learned from Fit 4 Mom.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.945
[Tammy] Hey, I just realized
my massive...

30:47.947 --> 30:50.147
- I missed it.
- [bleep]

30:51.783 --> 30:53.317
Oh, my God.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.019
[Amy speaking]

30:59.424 --> 31:04.328
He loves big women, but
she needs to lose this weight.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.282
[sighs]

31:26.184 --> 31:27.317
Just...

31:52.844 --> 31:54.344
[Tammy speaking]

32:06.257 --> 32:09.026
[Amy speaking]

32:18.970 --> 32:22.005
Tammy told me she broke
up with Phil and I'm like...

32:24.309 --> 32:26.843
Now you need
to work on yourself.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.814
<i>Tammy don't need somebody
that wants her to be a glutton.</i>

32:30.816 --> 32:33.917
Now that your Doctor Smith
appointment is coming up

32:33.919 --> 32:37.721
you got to show some real
progress, so we got to do this,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.223
- like, every day.
- I know.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.960
Even when I'm not around.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.364
[Amy speaking]

32:55.206 --> 33:00.010
- So, you ready to do some squats?
- No. I can't do squats.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.446
[Amy speaking]

33:28.373 --> 33:30.374
Tammy, let me get
the door real quick.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.344
<i>[Chris] This is going to be
the moment of truth.</i>

33:34.346 --> 33:37.447
I'm going to Doctor Smith's
to do a final weigh-in.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.654
<i>[Chris] The last few weeks I've
tried really hard to stay on track.</i>

33:44.656 --> 33:46.923
<i>No starches at all.</i>

33:46.925 --> 33:50.160
Chicken stir-fry
and cauliflower rice.

33:51.829 --> 33:52.796
[Chris speaking]

33:52.798 --> 33:55.232
- [Brittany] No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.402
- Is everybody ready to go?
- [Misty] I think so.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.373
- There's a whole lot of ass in this van today.
- [Misty] Yep.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.845
[Chris]
We brought Misty along because

34:08.847 --> 34:10.580
<i>somebody has to push Tammy
if I get my surgery.</i>

34:10.582 --> 34:13.250
<i>Brittany can't do it.</i>

34:13.252 --> 34:16.219
So, how does everybody feel
about this doctor's appointment?

34:19.557 --> 34:21.058
Why?

34:34.872 --> 34:37.240
Hopefully, God willing
and the creek don't rise,

34:44.515 --> 34:46.516
So...

34:46.518 --> 34:50.087
What happens if you don't
make weight when we get there?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.722
I'll probably be more depressed
than anything. I don't know.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.525
I was gonna say, it would kill
me working that hard to do it

34:55.527 --> 34:57.094
and then not, you know...

34:57.096 --> 35:00.230
- Not getting it?
- Yeah. That would really mess me up.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.965
[Chris] It's gonna suck.

35:01.967 --> 35:06.169
I'm tired of being on a diet all the
time to work towards the surgery

35:06.171 --> 35:08.972
that's, kind of, like
I'm never going to get.

35:09.407 --> 35:12.175
- I'd probably bawl.
- I don't know,

35:14.912 --> 35:19.015
If Doctor Smith turns me down
from having the surgery...

35:21.786 --> 35:23.253
<i>I don't know
what I'm going to do.</i>

35:26.958 --> 35:28.391
<i>[Chris] This is it.</i>

35:28.459 --> 35:31.995
<i>If I'm under 400 pounds that means
tomorrow I'm getting my surgery.</i>

35:46.043 --> 35:47.377
I was going to get the door.

35:48.613 --> 35:51.381
- Well, I didn't see that thing.
- Well...

35:51.383 --> 35:54.851
<i>[Tammy] Today is Chris and I's
one month follow-up appointment.</i>

35:54.853 --> 35:59.589
<i>He's going to find out if he might
get approved for surgery and...</i>

35:59.591 --> 36:02.926
I'm worried about
my appointment too, because...

36:02.928 --> 36:07.030
I know I haven't been doing
exactly everything

36:07.032 --> 36:09.232
Doctor Smith
has wanted me to do.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.335
- Hey, guys.
- [both] Hey.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.105
- How are we?
- I'm good.

36:15.107 --> 36:18.909
Tammy, when I saw you last
time I gave you some goals.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.443
How's that been going?

36:23.614 --> 36:25.115
Not good? Why?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.553
- You don't know?
- I really don't know.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.288
So portion control's
gotten worse?

36:33.791 --> 36:37.260
[Dr. Smith]
It's not improving. Okay.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.037
I think some of the other
goals we had were steps,

36:47.039 --> 36:52.008
and we were going to start at
75 and go up by five each day.

36:52.010 --> 36:52.976
How are we on that?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.179
[Dr. Smith] No?

36:56.181 --> 36:58.381
[Tammy speaking]

36:58.716 --> 37:00.217
Are we walking every day?

37:00.551 --> 37:04.020
No. So we're not even doing
the 75 a day.

37:05.790 --> 37:10.193
I'm angry with the fact that she did
not do anything that I asked her to do.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.896
<i>I just really feel like
she's wasting her time.</i>

37:12.898 --> 37:19.202
Let's get on the scale. Let's have
you weigh, and then let's talk, okay?

37:24.842 --> 37:27.143
[Tammy speaking]

37:46.197 --> 37:47.430
[Dr. Smith] 639.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.300
[Tammy speaking]

38:03.547 --> 38:05.815
That's the first time that
I've seen you in follow-up

38:05.817 --> 38:07.851
- that you didn't gain weight.
- Right.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.320
And that is a positive, and
I'm not going to make light of it,

38:11.122 --> 38:12.922
but it kind of ticks me off.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.158
And you know why?

38:15.160 --> 38:18.094
You told me all the
things we asked you to do,

38:18.096 --> 38:19.595
you didn't do.

38:19.597 --> 38:25.268
Can you imagine if you would actually
do these things that we're working with?

38:26.637 --> 38:29.939
What I'm trying to get you
to understand is that

38:29.941 --> 38:33.710
if you will do what I'm asking
you to do every single day,

38:33.712 --> 38:35.612
you will see results.

38:35.614 --> 38:40.016
The fact of the matter
is it works. It will work.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.287
<i>[Chris] You know, the rumor is
Tammy's relationship is over.</i>

38:44.289 --> 38:47.657
So I don't know if she's been
eating her feelings.

38:47.659 --> 38:52.829
Hell, I don't know what the hell's
going on, but it's frustrating as hell.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.131
What are you thinking right now?

38:59.003 --> 39:01.371
I want to see you back
in about a month, okay?

39:01.373 --> 39:03.139
I'm going to give you
the same goal.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.608
I'm not going to reduce it just
because you're not meeting it.

39:05.610 --> 39:09.479
- Right.
- Tammy, I want to see a log when you come next time.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.914
I want to see a piece of paper,

39:10.916 --> 39:12.716
or something in your phone
that you can show me,

39:12.718 --> 39:15.518
that you put a date
that you walked.

39:15.520 --> 39:21.224
And if you didn't walk on a
date just write you didn't walk.

39:21.226 --> 39:26.029
All right. So we'll see you in about a
month. I want to see 25 pounds gone.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.499
I'll never quit on you, you don't
ever quit on me, and we'll get there.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.666
But right now...

39:31.836 --> 39:35.205
No offence, I think I want it
more than you do for you.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.975
Prove me wrong, okay?
I want you to prove me wrong.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.211
[Tammy speaking]

39:59.163 --> 40:00.263
Chris?

40:00.265 --> 40:03.032
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.369
- [Tammy] Good luck.
- Appreciate it.

40:09.607 --> 40:13.209
I've been trying to get
this surgery 11 years.

40:13.211 --> 40:17.080
<i>Been a lot of setbacks
for one reason or another.</i>

40:18.015 --> 40:19.382
<i>This is it.</i>

40:32.663 --> 40:33.863
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going?

40:33.865 --> 40:34.931
- [Brittany] Hello.
- How are ya?

40:34.998 --> 40:36.399
Great.

40:38.736 --> 40:42.405
So, I guess the final verdict is
we want to see what this number is,

40:42.407 --> 40:43.840
- don't we?
- Yeah, I guess.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.275
How has your
activity level been?

40:47.478 --> 40:48.645
[Dr. Smith] Okay. Good.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.581
- You feel like you've done what you can do?
- Yeah.

40:51.583 --> 40:55.685
Okay. Good deal. Well, let's
find out what this number is,

40:55.687 --> 40:57.954
- and then we'll talk, okay?
- Yeah.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.489
All right, hop up here for me.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.924
[Chris] I'm taking my shoes off.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.927
[Dr. Smith] Okay, take your
shoes off. We can do that.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.062
Let's weigh you
how we have before.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.265
[Chris] Here we go.

41:11.769 --> 41:15.538
This is it and I am stressing.

41:15.540 --> 41:19.976
I have really buckled down
on what I've been eating, but...

41:29.487 --> 41:31.654
- [Amy] Come play with something you can play with.
- [Michael] Ouch.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.623
[Amy] Oh, I knew you were
going to hit your head.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.693
<i>[Tammy] Next time
on 1000-lb Sisters.</i>

41:36.695 --> 41:39.028
- I can't believe how fast Gage is growing.
- [Michael] I know.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.164
We definitely need more space.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.065
Look at that little house.

41:43.434 --> 41:47.804
Our house is getting too small for
the three of us. We have to move.

41:47.806 --> 41:51.708
-That's perfect. It's right next to the park.
-Yeah.

41:51.710 --> 41:56.179
I'm nervous to tell Tammy
I'm moving out, but it's time.

41:56.981 --> 42:00.950
My ex-boyfriend has been...

42:01.819 --> 42:03.720
harassing me.

42:03.722 --> 42:07.257
The situation with Phillip
got way out of hand.

42:07.259 --> 42:10.527
I got the police involved,

42:10.529 --> 42:13.263
and I never thought I'd be in
this kind of situation.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.133
You know, my job is
to do what's best for you,

42:17.135 --> 42:19.769
and sometimes that may be an
answer you don't want to hear.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.404
I don't understand it.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.973
I don't know how in the hell
this is possible.
