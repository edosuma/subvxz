08:46.150 --> 08:47.219
[HOLLOW KNOCK]

08:47.250 --> 08:48.217
HEAR THAT?
MM-HMM.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.239
WE HAVE SPORES
IN THE WALL.

08:49.290 --> 08:50.257
SPORES?

08:50.290 --> 08:51.314
KNOW WHERE ELSE
THEY ARE?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.429
IN THE PLANTER.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.529
YOU KNOW WHERE ELSE?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.619
EVERYWHERE
IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.629
WHO CALLED YOU?

08:57.670 --> 08:58.637
MIKE?

08:58.670 --> 08:59.739
MIKE?

08:59.770 --> 09:00.805
IS THIS A BIG JOKE TO YOU?

09:00.840 --> 09:01.078
I DON'T ANSWER TO MIKE.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.741
HAVE YOU SEEN MIKE
LATELY?

09:02.780 --> 09:04.213
MIKE CAN KISS MY ASS.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.717
I WAS CALLED IN
BY THE STATE INSPECTOR HIMSELF.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.559
ARE YOU AT ALL AWARE
HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS?

09:07.590 --> 09:08.557
HELL YES, I AM!

09:08.590 --> 09:09.682
GOOD. I'M GLAD.

09:09.730 --> 09:10.856
I NEED ACCESS
TO THIS WHOLE PLACE--

09:10.900 --> 09:13.664
ELEVATOR SHAI-TS, AIR VENTS,
THE SAFE ROOM, OBVIOUSLY--

09:13.700 --> 09:15.406
THE SAFE ROOM IS A CRIME SCENE.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.702
THIS EUCALYPTUS
WILL BE DEAD BY LUNCH.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.179
THE SAFE ROOM
WILL BE A TRIAGE UNIT

09:19.210 --> 09:20.541
IF I DON'T GET THOSE SPORES

09:20.580 --> 09:21.786
OUT OF THERE.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.378
UNDERSTOOD.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.513
CAN WE LET THE COPS
FINISH UP IN THERE FIRST?

09:25.560 --> 09:27.448
YOU TELL THEM TO HURRY.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.320
OH, MAN.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.778
13 MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT,

09:37.820 --> 09:40.254
MEMBERS OF THE WEDDING PARTY
ENTERED THE SAFE ROOM,

09:40.290 --> 09:42.952
PLACING THE RING
INTO A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX,

09:42.990 --> 09:45.493
WHICH WAS SLID INTO THE SAFE
AND CLOSED FOR THE NIGHT.

09:45.530 --> 09:46.736
NO SENSORS INDICATE

09:46.770 --> 09:48.397
THAT EITHER THE SAFE DOOR
OR THE LOCK BOX

09:48.440 --> 09:51.375
WAS OPENED AGAIN
UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING.

09:51.410 --> 09:52.308
PLEASE NOTE...

09:52.350 --> 09:54.272
HE HAS ACTIVATED THE TIME-LOCK,

09:54.320 --> 09:56.242
WHICH PREVENTS THE SAFE
FROM OPENING.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.952
NO ONE
WALKS INTO THAT ROOM AGAIN

09:58.990 --> 10:00.389
UNTIL THE FOLLOWING
MORNING,

10:00.430 --> 10:01.192
WHEN THE RING IS
DISCOVERED MISSING.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.623
SO IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T
DISAPPEAR DURING THE NIGHT.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.968
OR SO THEY WOULD
LIKE YOU TO THINK.

10:06.010 --> 10:07.329
HOWEVER, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

10:07.380 --> 10:08.779
THERE ARE NINE GLITCHES
ON THIS TAPE.

10:08.810 --> 10:11.415
I'M SORRY, GLITCH ES?

10:11.450 --> 10:12.849
SEAMS.
STATIC BURSTS IN THE IMAGE.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.812
SOMEONE
COULD HAVE TAPPED IN

10:14.860 --> 10:16.418
AN ALTERNATE VIDEO FEED
OF THIS ROOM

10:16.460 --> 10:17.119
WHILE IT WAS EMPTY,

10:17.160 --> 10:20.425
OR, MORE LIKELY, AS I BELIEVE,

10:20.470 --> 10:23.405
SOMEONE BUILT A SCALE REPLICA
OF THIS ROOM.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.237
[STIFLED GIGGLE]

10:27.380 --> 10:29.689

10:35.470 --> 10:36.664
IF SOMEONE DISAGREES
WITH MY THEORY,

10:36.700 --> 10:37.689
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.867
IT DOES SEEM VERY ELABORATE.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.938
AND JUST A BIT FAR-FETCHED.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.470
ARE YOU A DETECTIVE?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.385
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:46.420 --> 10:47.717
YOU ASKED
FOR ALL OF US TO COME.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.079
OH...

10:49.120 --> 10:50.792
WELL, OFFICER,

10:50.830 --> 10:52.024
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH
AN EXPERT ON FETCHING,

10:52.070 --> 10:54.391
WHY DON'T YOU FETCH ME

11:11.170 --> 11:13.001
YOU MAY REMEMBER HIM
FROM THE SECURITY VIDEO.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.405
HE WAS IN THE ROOM

11:14.440 --> 11:15.407
WHEN THE RING WAS PLACED

11:15.440 --> 11:16.714
INTO THE SAFETY
DEPOSIT BOX.

11:16.750 --> 11:17.717
DURING QUESTIONING,

11:17.750 --> 11:19.445
HE WAS NERVOUS, EVASIVE,

11:19.490 --> 11:21.754
AND CONTRADICTED HIMSELF
MORE THAN ONCE.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.052
HIS WORK COMPUTER
HISTORY REVEALS

11:23.090 --> 11:24.694
THAT HE RECENTLY
VISITED WEBSITES

11:24.730 --> 11:26.698
FOR BOATS
AND EXPENSIVE CARS,

11:26.740 --> 11:31.632
AND HE FAILED
TO SHOW UP FOR WORK.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.409

11:33.450 --> 11:35.509
IS THIS YOUR ONLY LEAD?

11:35.550 --> 11:38.610

TO MY INTERROGATION

11:38.660 --> 11:40.525

IS IN THE ANIMAL HOSPITAL.

HER LEG IS BROKEN.

13:59.810 --> 14:00.879
I'M VERY BUSY.

14:00.910 --> 14:01.672
BUT YOUR CAT NEEDS YOU,

14:01.680 --> 14:03.375
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.809
THE VET SAID
IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE.

14:04.850 --> 14:05.441
LATER.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.254
YOU HAVE TO GO.

14:07.290 --> 14:09.224
MR. GUSTER, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE IN SHOCK.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.784

14:29.400 --> 14:30.389
YOU MADE HER
A TINY SANTA HAT.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.988
ORABLE.
FANTASTIC.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.462
I CAN'T EVEN HAVE
A MAKE-BELIEVE BOY CAT.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.171
GUS, A BOY CAT
WOULDN'T SERVE MY PURPOSES

14:35.210 --> 14:36.916
NEARLY AS WELL.

14:36.950 --> 14:38.417
THE NEXT TIME I NEED YOU,
PICKLES IS HAVING KITTENS.

14:38.450 --> 14:40.088
"PICKLES"?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.883

IS HER FULL NAME...

14:41.930 --> 14:42.988
THOUGH I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE
CATS CAN MARRY,

14:44.130 --> 14:45.552
YEAH, WELL, IN A RELATED ISSUE,

14:45.600 --> 14:48.489
I'M BLOCKING YOUR NUMBER
ON ALL THE PHONES IN THE OFFICE.

14:48.540 --> 14:50.064
IF YOU THINK THAT'LL WORK,
I THINK IT'S ENDEARING.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.179
IN THE MEANTIME,

14:51.210 --> 14:52.302
AREN'T YOU
THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS

14:52.350 --> 14:53.476
ABOUT WHO WAS THERE

14:53.510 --> 14:54.977
WHEN THEY PUT THE RING
IN THE HOTEL SAFE?

14:56.550 --> 14:57.812
WAIT A MINUTE...

14:57.860 --> 14:59.885
THIS IS A SAFECRACKING CASE?

14:59.930 --> 15:01.420
DID I FORGET TO MENTION THAT?

15:04.140 --> 15:05.539
WHAT KIND OF SAFE?

15:05.570 --> 15:07.003
THE, UH...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.473
HYDRA 700?

15:08.510 --> 15:10.842
THE 700 IS OUT?

15:10.880 --> 15:11.915
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.247
NOBODY COULD HAVE
CRACKED THAT.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.850
I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE WALL SENSORS.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.924
CAN WE BE DONE BY 3:00?

15:20.030 --> 15:22.089
YES.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.305
THE SAFE ROOM...

15:26.350 --> 15:28.614
RIGHT BEHIND THAT DOOR.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.418
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

15:31.460 --> 15:33.121
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A SAFE JOB.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.321
OH, UH, LASSITER
HAS THIS INSANE IDEA

15:35.360 --> 15:37.965
THAT THIS IS
AN ELABORATE HEIST,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.035
LIKE ON PAR WITH
OCEAN'S ELEVEN,

15:39.070 --> 15:41.072
OR THOMAS CROWN,
OR, UH...

15:41.110 --> 15:42.441
THE ONE WHERE THEY
KILL DONALD SUTHERLAND

15:42.480 --> 15:43.947
IN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.072
REMAKE. UH...

15:45.120 --> 15:46.519

WON DERING--

15:51.460 --> 15:52.996
I SENT AN OFFICER
DOWN TO THE HIGH SCHOOL

15:53.030 --> 15:54.463
TO TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR SECRETARY SUSPECT.

15:56.070 --> 15:57.230
SHE CRACKED.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.204
HE DIDN'T EVEN GET
THE FIRST QUESTION OUT.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.049
REALLY? BUT--

16:01.080 --> 16:03.219
BECAUSE I...

16:03.250 --> 16:04.478
ENVISIONED THAT BEING HARDER.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.158
YET I DON'T RECALL ASKING YOU

16:06.190 --> 16:08.090
TO COME DOWN HERE
TO THE DE LA CRUZ.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.018
WELL, WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THIS CASE GOES

16:10.070 --> 16:11.435
IN A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.732
HUH.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.170
LET ME BE PERFECT LY CLEAR--

16:16.650 --> 16:19.118
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
AND WE DIDN'T TALK.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.258
CALL ME IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.060
I LOVE HER.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.089
YEAH.

16:42.170 --> 16:43.091
HE KNOWS YOU?

16:43.130 --> 16:44.199
I HAD TO LAY
SOME GROUNDWORK.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.197
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN PSYCHICS.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.036
THIS IS PLAN "B".

16:46.070 --> 16:47.537
CHIEF INSPECTOR SHAWN.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.433
HOW ARE YOU?
SHH.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.504
I'M UNDERCOVER.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.369
NOT EVEN
THE AMERICAN POLICE

16:50.410 --> 16:51.411
KNOW I'M IN ON THIS.

16:51.450 --> 16:52.474
I'M SORRY. I-I BLEW IT AGAIN.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.408
A-AND AFTER YOU BROUGHT ME
INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE--

16:54.450 --> 16:55.781
BOBBY.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.481
IT'S FINE.

16:57.530 --> 16:58.622
BELIEVE ME,
THESE OTHER INTERPOL GUYS

16:58.660 --> 16:59.661
ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE

16:59.700 --> 17:00.826
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.030
HOW LONG WILL YOU NEED?

17:02.040 --> 17:06.204
JUST AS WE DISCUSSED.
FIVE MINUTES, TOPS.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.740
YOU'RE MY MAN.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.687
INTERPOL?

17:13.730 --> 17:14.685
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:14.730 --> 17:15.754
MISSING RING DIVISION.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.222
I WAS RECRUITED
OUT OF NORTH AFRICA

17:17.270 --> 17:18.237
WHEN I WAS 15.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.168
YOU COULD HAVE
AT LEAST USED

17:19.200 --> 17:20.462
A BRITISH ACCENT.

17:20.510 --> 17:21.875
[BRITISH ACCENT]:
OH, PLEASE, GUS.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.309
I STARTED WITH
A BRITISH ACCENT,

17:23.350 --> 17:24.612
AND THEN
SEAMLESSLY SLIPPED...

17:24.650 --> 17:26.140
[NORMAL VOICE]:

THEY'RE HERE FOR YOU.

33:46.310 --> 33:47.607
NOT IF I
SOLVE THIS CASE FIRST.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.639
GOOD PLAN.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.669
YOU'VE GOT
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.846
I ALREADY KNOW
WHO DID IT.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.211
NO, YOU DON'T.
WHO IS THAT POSSIBLE?

33:52.260 --> 33:53.318
BETWEEN ALL THAT?

33:53.360 --> 33:54.122
WHEN YOU SAID

33:54.160 --> 33:55.479
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
JUST HAD AN ANEURYSM

33:55.530 --> 33:56.622
BECAUSE SHE GOT
THE WRONG BOUQUET?

33:56.660 --> 33:57.661
YOU HAD THE TIME

33:57.700 --> 33:59.133
TO PUT ALL THAT
OUT OF YOUR MIND

33:59.170 --> 34:00.194
AND SOLVE THE CASE?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.400
WHAT?

34:01.440 --> 34:02.771
AND NOW...

34:02.810 --> 34:04.072
FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

34:06.350 --> 34:07.612
GUS, I SERIOUSLY DO
HAVE A GUESS.

34:07.650 --> 34:10.414
PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.257
I DON'T KNOW.
HIGH 60$?

34:12.290 --> 34:13.325
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.327
BUT THE PERSON'S IN THE ROOM.

34:14.370 --> 34:15.325
SHH.

34:15.370 --> 34:16.496
THE THIEF COULD ESCAPE.

34:16.540 --> 34:17.438
SHOULDN'T I
STOP THE WEDDING?

34:17.470 --> 34:19.472
NO, UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES

34:19.510 --> 34:20.636
ARE YOU ALLOWED
TO STOP THIS WEDDING.

34:21.780 --> 34:25.443
IF THERE'S ANY REASON
WHY THESE TWO SHOULD NOT BE WED,

34:25.490 --> 34:27.458
SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.137
I HAVE SOMETHING.

34:34.510 --> 34:36.432
IT'S NOT NECESSARI LY
MARRIAGE-RELATED.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.606
I HOPE THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

34:38.810 --> 34:39.742
SIR, PLEASE--

34:39.780 --> 34:42.351
I KNOW WHO STOLE THE RING.

34:42.390 --> 34:43.516
YOU CANNOT DO THIS, SHAWN.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.653
THIS WEDDING HAS TAKEN
OVER A YEAR TO PLAN.

34:45.690 --> 34:46.554
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:46.600 --> 34:48.522
RADIOING THE CHIEF.

34:48.570 --> 34:50.538
I CAN SEE IT.

34:50.570 --> 34:51.707
I CAN FEEL IT.

34:51.740 --> 34:55.198
I CAN NOW FEEL THE RING.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.571
IT'S IN THIS ROOM.

34:57.620 --> 34:58.939
IT'S IN THE ROOM.

34:58.990 --> 35:00.252
IT'S IN THIS ROOM.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.522
THEY WOULDN'T BRING
THE STOLEN RING

35:02.560 --> 35:03.857
TO THE CEREMONY,
YOU MORON.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.219
THEY WOULD IF THEY
COULDN'T GET TO IT

35:05.270 --> 35:06.862

35:08.740 --> 35:10.674
LACEY, I'M SO SORRY,

35:10.710 --> 35:12.575
AND BELIEVE ME
WHEN I SAY

35:12.620 --> 35:15.885
I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WISH
IT WASN'T YOU.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.582
ME?

35:18.630 --> 35:20.655
ARE YOU CRAZY?

35:20.700 --> 35:22.736
I'M THE ONE WHO'S DONE
ALL THE WORK.

35:22.770 --> 35:24.567
YES, YOU ARE,

35:24.610 --> 35:25.804
AND WE'RE ALL VERY IMPRESSED,

35:25.840 --> 35:27.273
BUT IT WAS ALSO
AN EXCELLENT COVER,

35:27.310 --> 35:28.277
WASN'T IT?

35:28.310 --> 35:30.778
YOU ARE CRAZY, SHAWN.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.980
AND BY THE WAY,

35:32.020 --> 35:33.658
WE'RE OFFICIALLY OFF

35:38.400 --> 35:39.731
YOU'RE AT THE DINNER TABLE.

35:39.770 --> 35:40.737
THEY'RE ANNOUNCING
THE ENGAGEMENT.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.328
YOU'RE THRILLED, OF COURSE.

35:42.380 --> 35:44.007
YOU AND BETHANY HAVE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS FOREVER.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.473
DAD...

35:45.510 --> 35:46.818
DAD HAS A SURPRISE
FOR THE HAPPY COUPLE.

35:46.850 --> 35:48.511
WHAT COULD IT BE?

35:48.550 --> 35:50.415
WAIT A MINUTE.

35:50.460 --> 35:54.499
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE RING
WAS GOING TO DYLAN.

35:56.370 --> 35:57.632
YOU WERE ALWAYS
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FAVORITE,

35:57.670 --> 35:59.069
AND YOU'RE THE OLDEST GIRL.

35:59.110 --> 36:01.408
THAT RING SHOULD BE YOURS,
RIGHT?

36:01.450 --> 36:03.748
RIGHT.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.509
YOU WERE COUNTING ON THAT RING.

36:05.550 --> 36:07.359
IT WAS YOUR FUTURE.

36:07.390 --> 36:08.687
OH!

36:10.630 --> 36:11.767
[GASPS]

36:11.800 --> 36:12.994
SORRY.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.861
I CAN SEE YOU PLOTTING.

36:14.910 --> 36:17.538
I CAN SEE YOU PLOTTING
RIGHT THERE AT THE DINNER TABLE,

36:17.580 --> 36:19.616
BUT DAD...

36:19.650 --> 36:21.880
DAD THROWS A CURVEBALL.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.016
NO, IT WAS A SLIDER.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.822
HE'S OVERLY CAUTIOUS,

36:26.860 --> 36:28.361
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
ENGAGEMENTS END.

36:29.170 --> 36:30.398
NOT YOU GUYS.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.964
IT'S OKAY.

36:32.010 --> 36:33.477
THEY'RE NOT LETTING GO
OF THE RING

36:33.510 --> 36:34.977
UNTIL THE WEDDING,

36:35.010 --> 36:38.639
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE
A VERY SMALL WINDOW

36:38.690 --> 36:41.682
WITHIN WHICH TO GRAB IT.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.493
DOES ALL OF THIS
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

36:43.530 --> 36:45.418
WITH WHY THESE TWO
SHOULDN'T BE MARRIED?

36:45.470 --> 36:47.097
NO, SIR.

36:47.140 --> 36:49.938
NO, IT DOESN'T AT ALL,
ACTUALLY.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.072
WHOA!

36:51.110 --> 36:52.179
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.814
OH, BOY!

36:53.850 --> 36:55.989
OH, BOY. OH, BOY.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.928
OF COURSE.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.860
YOU INSISTED
IT BE USED DURING THE REHEARSAL,

37:01.900 --> 37:02.764
SO THEN YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.097
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE

37:04.140 --> 37:07.007
WAS FAWNING
OVER THE RING,

37:07.040 --> 37:09.179
YOU MADE ONE FINAL ADJUSTMENT.

37:09.210 --> 37:11.519
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU JUST
STRAIGHTENED IT OUT

37:11.550 --> 37:12.642
AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK,

37:12.690 --> 37:15.682
BUT YOU NEVER DID, DID YOU?

37:15.730 --> 37:19.860
NO, LACEY, BECAUSE YOU...

37:19.900 --> 37:21.936
HAVE MAGIC HANDS...

37:21.970 --> 37:25.974
WHICH I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO ON FRIDAY.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.875
EVERYONE WAS FOOLED.

37:27.920 --> 37:33.529
EVERYONE WAS FOOLED EXCEPT...

37:33.560 --> 37:34.993
DIETRICH MANNHEIM,

37:35.030 --> 37:36.759
WHO HADN'T YET DISCOVERED

37:36.800 --> 37:38.700
HOW TO USE THIS INFORMATION
TO HIS BENEFIT.

37:38.740 --> 37:41.208
THIS IS FIRST-RATE FICTION,
SHAWN.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.970
UNFORTU NATELY,
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.647
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
NO EVIDENCE...

37:45.690 --> 37:48.921
IF YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY THAT NIGHT...

37:48.960 --> 37:51.224
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.568
AH!

37:52.600 --> 37:54.033
YES!

37:54.070 --> 37:56.800
YOU WERE CALLED AWAY.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.618
THE FLORIST.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.221
THE FLORIST BAILED ON YOU.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.249
THE BOUQUETS.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.996
YOU GOT A LAST-MINUTE BATCH
OF MATERIALS,

38:10.040 --> 38:12.702
AND THE BOUQUETS WOULD NOW
HAVE TO BE CRAI-TED BY HAND.

38:12.740 --> 38:14.207
THERE WAS NO OTHER TIME
BUT NOW.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.640
YOU LOOKED FOR A WAY OUT,
BUT THERE WAS NONE.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.147
YOU HAD
A FIVE-MILLION-DOLLAR RING

38:18.180 --> 38:19.909
THAT WAS ABOUT TO BE
DISCOVERED MISSING

38:19.960 --> 38:21.018
ANY MINUTE

38:21.060 --> 38:23.119
HIDDEN IN YOUR PALM,

38:23.160 --> 38:24.764
AND YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO
PULL AN ALL-NIGHTER

38:24.800 --> 38:26.859
IN A ROOM
WITH EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.164
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
GET BACK INTO THE COOLER LATER

38:29.210 --> 38:31.940
AND GRAB IT,

38:31.980 --> 38:34.949
BUT THEY KEPT THEIR FLOWERS
LOCKED UP,

38:34.990 --> 38:37.652
SO YOU HAD TO HAVE
YOUR SPECIFIC BOUQUET

38:37.690 --> 38:39.021
OR ELSE.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.221
LACEY, YOU'RE NOT
AN UNREASONABLE PERSON.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.069
YOU'RE JUST A THIEF.

38:45.140 --> 38:48.678
OR AT LEAST
YOU WERE A THIEF...

38:48.710 --> 38:51.042
UNTIL DIETRICH MANNHEIM CALLED,

38:51.080 --> 38:53.287
TOLD YOU THAT HE WAS ON TO YOU.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.981
HE WANTED
A PIECE OF THAT ACTION, TOO,

38:55.030 --> 38:56.429
OR HE WAS GOING TO THE POLICE.

38:56.460 --> 39:00.999
YOU TRIED TO TALK HIM DOWN,
BUT HE GOT ROUGH.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.372
HE GOT UGLY.

39:03.410 --> 39:06.208
IT WAS ALL SPINNING
OUT OF CONTROL.

39:06.250 --> 39:09.959
EVENTUALLY, THEY WERE GOING TO
FIND THAT BODY,

39:09.990 --> 39:11.457
SO YOU STARTED
LAYING OUT CLUES.

39:11.490 --> 39:12.991
YOU SENT THE POLICE OFF

39:13.030 --> 39:14.327
IN ALL DIRECTIONS,

39:14.360 --> 39:16.169

39:19.140 --> 39:20.175
I WOULD SAY THAT'S FORTUITOUS,

39:20.210 --> 39:22.144
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
JUST WHAT TO LEAVE,

39:22.180 --> 39:23.101
DIDN'T YOU?

39:23.150 --> 39:27.416
I HAVE WORKED 18 HOURS A DAY
ON THIS WEDDING.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.997

39:30.030 --> 39:32.294
I WILL NOT BE TREATED THIS WAY.

YOUR BOUQUET, LACEY.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.551
