32:24.525 --> 32:27.236
But first I have to know
that my family's gonna be safe.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.072
Your family?

32:31.824 --> 32:32.659
What family?

32:34.452 --> 32:36.329
You can't even stay at your own house.

32:37.705 --> 32:38.706
Danny.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.917
I need to know...

32:42.835 --> 32:44.629
that my family's gonna be safe.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.049
John.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.717
You're waiting in your car...

32:53.805 --> 32:55.431
for somebody to kill me.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.894
You're hoping that he does.

33:01.938 --> 33:02.772
What about me?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.193
Aren't I your family?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.574
Let's you and I meet tomorrow.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.869
There's something I want to tell you.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.579
Okay.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.207
Well, I think it's a bad idea.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.668
I think it's a really bad idea.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.170
But if you want.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.132
You remember that bay
we used to go to?

33:31.134 --> 33:32.510
When we were in high school?

33:33.803 --> 33:34.971
After a big night.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.098
And we'd watch the sunrise.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.391
Yeah, I remember.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.104
You gave me my first cigarette.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.400
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.028
We can watch the sunrise together.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.321
The sunrise.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.532
That sounds great.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.415
[Danny laughing]

34:44.499 --> 34:45.750
When's it gonna end?

34:47.502 --> 34:48.711
When's it gonna end, John?

34:50.088 --> 34:50.922
When's it gonna end?

34:52.256 --> 34:54.217
-[Danny continues laughing]

34:56.260 --> 34:57.178
What?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.433
John, when's it gonna end?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.310

[thunder crashing]

35:34.257 --> 35:35.091
Hey, John.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.099
There have clearly been some things
going on with this family.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.938
I think it would be good if we, uh...
all talked.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.531
You want to go first?

36:00.449 --> 36:01.284
No?

36:01.367 --> 36:02.201
Okay.

36:04.954 --> 36:05.997
I'll go first.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.251
You showed some real balls tonight, John.

36:10.793 --> 36:14.172
Getting rid of me makes complete sense.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.673
On every level.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.216
But...

36:18.926 --> 36:19.802
[chuckles]

36:21.304 --> 36:22.180
you can't do it.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.267
Or if you can...

36:28.269 --> 36:29.770
you can't live with yourself.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.609
'Cause you're weak.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.113
Weak.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.827
You know,
what you have looks like strength.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.162
But really...

36:47.705 --> 36:49.665
a badge and a uniform?

36:51.250 --> 36:55.671
It's just a... costume and a performance.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.761
So what is it?
What's going on underneath there?

37:03.179 --> 37:04.430
That's what I want to know.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.141
Behind all the make believe.

37:08.809 --> 37:12.772
What is it that scares you so much?

37:15.691 --> 37:17.151
I'm not scared.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.070
Then why are we still here?

37:21.530 --> 37:24.659
Why am I still here?

37:30.414 --> 37:31.666
I'll see you at the beach.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.169
I can't go to the beach.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.464
I'm--

37:39.882 --> 37:41.133
I'm not going to the beach.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.720
Oh, yeah, you will.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.097
[laughing]

37:47.640 --> 37:48.516
I can't do that.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.686
Oh, yeah.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.313
You will.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.694
[♪♪♪]

38:05.491 --> 38:06.617
[phone ringing]

38:14.250 --> 38:15.084
Hello?

38:15.584 --> 38:16.961
[woman] John, is that you?

38:17.461 --> 38:18.296
Yes.

38:18.879 --> 38:19.839
I'm leaving, John.

38:21.173 --> 38:22.008
Chelsea?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.134
Yeah. It's me.

38:24.343 --> 38:25.469
John, are you all right?

38:26.887 --> 38:27.722
Is he okay?

38:28.097 --> 38:29.098
What do you mean?

38:30.391 --> 38:31.517
Is Eric okay?

38:32.018 --> 38:32.852
John.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.270
Hey, where are you?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.106
I'm at the funeral home.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.485
I'm coming over there right now.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.195
I don't think it's a good idea.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.823
-No, I'm gonna come over there right now--
-No.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.616
I don't want you here, John.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.493
Listen to me. Just stay there, please.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.537
I need to ask you something. Please.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.499
[heavy splash]

39:08.596 --> 39:09.430
I'm sorry.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.643
It's too late for that.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.523
If I had to do it over--

39:19.607 --> 39:21.108
It doesn't work that way, right?

39:21.984 --> 39:23.652
You don't get that chance.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.906
You said what you said in court.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.284
Well, I didn't have a choice.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.911
You had to protect Kevin.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.038
We all know that.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.331
It's not your fault, John.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.626
That's what you came here to ask me,
right?

39:38.709 --> 39:39.835
If we blame you?

39:42.338 --> 39:43.923
You can't be someone you're not.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.344
We all know that.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.638
I'm moving away.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.350
There's nothing left for me here.

39:55.976 --> 39:56.811
I'm sorry.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.605
I'm leaving the bad behind.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.693
You should do that too, Nolan.

40:05.945 --> 40:06.779
Get out of here.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.241
I keep trying to do the right thing.

40:11.867 --> 40:12.910
Over and over.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.082
I just don't know what it is
that I need to do, though.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.255
[♪♪♪]

40:26.340 --> 40:28.300
I don't know what it is that I need to do.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.975
[Nolan] He was my dad's best friend.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.565
Everything about him, it's...

40:44.191 --> 40:45.985
It's all going away. It's like he's...

40:46.902 --> 40:47.945
getting erased.

40:51.115 --> 40:51.949
What about Beth?

40:54.118 --> 40:55.411
She's different. She--

40:56.495 --> 40:57.997
She always tried to protect him.

41:00.082 --> 41:00.916
Why?

41:01.959 --> 41:02.793
She loved him.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.504
Like family should be.

41:06.338 --> 41:07.756
Unconditionally.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.551
Why didn't they stay together?

41:11.343 --> 41:13.137
They never were together like that.

41:15.890 --> 41:16.724
How did they meet?

41:17.892 --> 41:18.726
I don't know.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.103
I never asked.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.404
Do you have any good memories of my dad?

41:30.488 --> 41:32.239
-Of course I do.
-Like what?

41:38.829 --> 41:39.663
I thought so.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.292
I told you a story about us swimming.

41:45.794 --> 41:46.629
Tell me again.

41:52.927 --> 41:53.761
My dad...

41:56.263 --> 41:57.431
the way he taught Danny

41:57.515 --> 42:00.935
was he took him out in the middle
of the ocean and he threw him overboard.

42:02.436 --> 42:03.812
He expected him to swim.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.023
And he did.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.110
When it came to be my turn...

42:12.071 --> 42:15.574
Danny jumps in the water and yells,
"Come on in, Johnny. The water's great."

42:16.158 --> 42:17.284
Come on. I got you.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.410
"I got you."

42:21.038 --> 42:21.872
"I got you."

42:23.916 --> 42:25.334
He took the fear out of me, you see.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.381
Then Kevin, you remember Kevin.
You remember that.

42:30.839 --> 42:34.301
I mean, we just threw him overboard
and we expected him to swim.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.053
-We really did.
-[young Danny] But Kevin...

42:36.136 --> 42:37.137
[both laughing]

42:37.221 --> 42:38.806
...sank like a stone.

42:40.641 --> 42:44.270
And then we had to go back
and pick him up.

42:48.607 --> 42:49.775
Are you sure that's true?

42:51.902 --> 42:52.820
What do you mean?

42:57.366 --> 42:59.577
I heard your story. I don't buy it.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.747
You guys grew up around water.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.333
You'd have been swimming
since you were really little.

43:07.710 --> 43:08.752
What really happened?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.047
It's not a story.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.135
-That's what happened. That's true.
-I mean with you.

43:17.386 --> 43:18.721
Did you try to kill yourself?

43:22.391 --> 43:24.059
And I don't want some story.

43:25.686 --> 43:26.562
I want the truth.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.795

44:04.433 --> 44:05.726
Let's do something fun.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.144
[man] Good morning, John.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.439
Do you remember me from last night?

44:53.273 --> 44:54.149
No, I don't.

44:55.442 --> 44:56.443
This is wrong.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.154
There's no wrong or right, John.

44:59.613 --> 45:01.156
There's just what is.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.161
[♪♪♪]

45:06.245 --> 45:08.747
And maybe
we can figure this out together.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.291
You stay the fuck away from me.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.835
-Sit down.
-You stay the fuck--

45:23.429 --> 45:24.263
[John] Now, listen.

45:25.013 --> 45:28.142
You have to learn to be able
to leave the past behind. I--

45:28.725 --> 45:32.521
I know that you're upset because you think
that your father is disappearing.

45:33.188 --> 45:36.150
And I know that you're upset
because Eric is dead.

45:36.775 --> 45:41.405
But you-- You gotta be able
to let these things go.

45:46.118 --> 45:48.537
That's what I should have said
to you in the car.

45:50.247 --> 45:51.081
Said when?

45:53.167 --> 45:55.210
In the car,
on the way back from Eric's wake.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.421
-That's what I should have said.
-Eric's wake?

45:57.963 --> 45:59.590
I've been here dealing with Sally.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.431
What about Mom?

46:11.685 --> 46:13.854
Are you okay?
Is there something wrong with you?

[man] Hey, John.

46:56.438 --> 46:57.856
Take a deep breath.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.484
You're going to have
to handle some difficult issues.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.195
We have your mother's DNR here.

47:03.737 --> 47:04.738
What?

47:05.489 --> 47:07.157
You know what a DNR is?

47:09.117 --> 47:10.452
How is my mother?

47:10.536 --> 47:12.454
Well, she took some pills, John.

47:12.829 --> 47:15.249
And it's understandable
after all she's been through.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.167
What all of you have been through.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.503
Wait. Wait a second. How is she?

47:19.711 --> 47:21.421
I mean, I'm her health proxy.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.632
You're not, John. That's the problem.

47:24.550 --> 47:28.178
Mrs. Rayburn had a new health proxy
notarized a few days ago.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.806
There's some question about his age.

but everything's gonna be all right.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.183
We're gonna get through this.

[Danny] No.

48:21.565 --> 48:22.399
What?

48:23.233 --> 48:24.901
[whispering] Mom, she's not the answer.

-What are you talking about?
-This isn't it.

48:28.363 --> 48:29.698
You're wasting your time.

-You think this is fun for me?
-What the fuck do you want?

That's it, little brother.
Only you know the answer to that.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.259
Think about it. Think about it.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.012
Since we were kids.
