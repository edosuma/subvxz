WEBVTT

00:02.128 --> 00:05.214
I'm so sorry if I caused
Mr. Hogan any trouble.

00:05.214 --> 00:06.799
I misunderstood.

00:07.591 --> 00:08.801
I would never accuse him. I just...

00:08.801 --> 00:11.887
I would remind you, your NDA prohibits you

00:11.887 --> 00:15.307
from speaking about anything
that happened here.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.643
Please. I have no savings.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.853
I'm in a month-to-month sublet.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.938
I gave up everything for this job.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.566
All I've ever wanted to do

00:23.566 --> 00:25.401
is to help make music.

00:25.401 --> 00:29.113
NDA also says that if you disclose
anything from your time here,

00:29.113 --> 00:30.823
you forfeit your severance.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.700
You're gonna need that money.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.745
So make smart choices, for once.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.288
See her out.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.372
Ma'am.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.335
Make sure she gets clear of the building

00:43.335 --> 00:44.962
and wipe that laptop.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.590
I need to go find a replacement.

00:53.596 --> 00:56.015
Hi. I'm Jenna.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.684
No. Okay. That's too casual. Um...

00:59.351 --> 01:02.605
I am a big fan.

01:02.605 --> 01:03.731
Okay, what are you,
a creepy stalker now?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.775
I mean, ugh.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.152
Monroe. Jenna Monroe.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.448
What is wrong with me?

01:25.961 --> 01:27.171
We didn't call for you.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.839
No.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.801
And... you're probably not going to

01:31.801 --> 01:33.928
because I'm pretty sure
that everybody in that room

01:33.928 --> 01:36.555
has much better resumes than me,

01:36.555 --> 01:39.809
and Ivy League degrees
and high-profile internships.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.185
I've got none of that.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.103
And you're gonna hire one of them
before you even get to me.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.231
Okay. I'm calling security.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.232
Hold on.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.611
Speech first, then security.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.322
Go, kid.

01:56.492 --> 01:59.662
Problem is,
if you hire one of those people,

01:59.662 --> 02:01.872
they're not gonna work like I will

02:01.872 --> 02:03.624
because they don't want it like I do.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.544
I mean, I worked two jobs
and lived at home

02:06.544 --> 02:07.878
to put myself through state school

02:07.878 --> 02:10.089
to get a dual degree in music
and business.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.425
I have no fallback.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.053
This job would literally be my life.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.888
I mean, late nights, weekends.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.975
All I want is to be a small part
of what you guys do here,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.436
find new artists
and introduce them to the world,

02:25.688 --> 02:28.357
because I truly believe

02:29.191 --> 02:30.609
that music can change lives.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.739
Let me help you change lives.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.039
That's the kind of fire
we need around here.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.833
I am sold. You're hired.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.210
Oh, my God!

02:48.210 --> 02:49.545
Thank you! Thank you.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.089
- I'll send the other ones home.
- Yeah.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.175
- Uh, do you want my resume?
- No.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.472
Thank you! Thank you.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.394
The position has been filled.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.104
Thank you for your interest.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.316
We will keep resumes
for future consideration.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.151
- Aw, man.
- Great.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.945
Um, guys, I think we have a problem.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.401
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.403
You weren't here when I interviewed.
Are you new, too?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.197
I am. It's my first day.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.074
My name is Jeb. Nice to meet you.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.825
- Jenna.
- Jenna.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.577
I hope Steve's okay.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.996
Oh, the dude that was here before me?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.539
Uh, yeah, he's fine.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.291
He won a cruise around the world.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.293
I'm filling in for him
while he's gone, so...

04:11.293 --> 04:13.587
- Wow. How random is that?
- Yeah.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.923
Well, seems like everybody
is getting lucky.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.925
- Bye.
- See you.

04:21.261 --> 04:26.058
Mr. Hogan's coffee
must be exactly 130 degrees.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.893
1-3-0 degrees.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.562
Mr. Hogan's office is his sanctum.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.273
You don't show anyone in there,
even with an appointment,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.234
without clearing it with me.

04:35.234 --> 04:39.029
You don't go in there
without clearing it with me.

04:39.029 --> 04:43.075
And under no circumstances,
do you ever, ever put a call through

04:43.075 --> 04:44.576
from his ex-wife, Sylvia.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.578
Okay. No call, Sylvia.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.956
This is Mr. Brimley, head of security.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.333
He has your standard NDA.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.043
Gotta sign
before you can start to work.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.837
- Oh.
- Company rules.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.381
Yeah. It's just, uh,
I have a business degree,

04:57.381 --> 05:02.177
so I like to really read every clause.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.015
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.189
Mr. Hogan's calendar is on your laptop.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.942
That calendar must be kept current.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.695
At the end of every day,
you will send the updated calendar

05:19.695 --> 05:22.072
to myself and Mr. Brimley, understood?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.365
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.035
Carol! Help me.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.662
You're the only one who can
make sense out of any of this stuff.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.039
I'm on my way.

05:34.043 --> 05:37.421
Okay. Looking forward
to working with you, too.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.328
What's this?

06:10.829 --> 06:11.830
Huh.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.043
Lethbridge Stewart.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.878
Huh.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.425
Mr. Hogan, I'm sorry to bother you,

06:23.425 --> 06:25.761
but I noticed something odd
about a calendar appointment.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.971
<i>Why don't you come on in here
and fill me in?</i>

06:27.971 --> 06:29.765
Oh, I am--Carol said that
I'm not supposed to...

06:29.765 --> 06:32.184
<i>Yeah, don't worry about Carol.
Come on in here.</i>

06:41.777 --> 06:44.071
Oh!

06:44.071 --> 06:45.489
Yeah, don't worry about Carol.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.201
I know she seems like a hard-ass,
but she's really a big softie at heart.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.911
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.746
You should see her bookshelf.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.582
- Wall-to-wall romance novels.
- Oh.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.044
It's motion-activated.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.171
I get an alert on my phone

07:01.171 --> 07:02.840
whenever it detects movement.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.928
But everybody can use
a little privacy from time to time, right?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.138
Yeah.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.431
Confidential client meetings,
stuff like that.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.812
Wanna try?

07:16.812 --> 07:17.980
I can help you.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.150
Actually, uh, Mr. Hogan,
it's about your calendar.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.777
Carol set an appointment
with, uh, Ms. Lethbridge Stewart

07:23.777 --> 07:25.028
from Be Funky Records.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.613
Oh, yeah, that's our parent label.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.241
Well, that name, uh, Lethbridge Stewart,

07:29.241 --> 07:31.410
it's a--it's a <i>Doctor Who</i> character.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.662
From the TV show.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.955
- Oh.
- Yes.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.707
So, I figured, what if someone was,

07:36.707 --> 07:38.876
you know, trying to get an appointment
with you under false pretenses?

07:38.876 --> 07:40.586
Oh. Like my ex-wife.

07:40.586 --> 07:41.503
Sylvia.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.046
I checked Be Funky's website directory.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.381
Nobody with the name works there.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.217
Carol!

07:48.927 --> 07:50.596
We need to cancel the...

07:50.596 --> 07:53.348
- Lethbridge Stewart.
- ...Lethbridge Stewart meeting.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.226
Good catch, Jenna.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.729
I knew you were the right girl.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.482
What did I tell you
about going into his office?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.243
What are you?

08:19.750 --> 08:22.711
Oh, sorry. Do you know where IT is?

08:22.711 --> 08:26.590
I, uh, think I got turned around.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.134
Uh-oh. Hmm.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.728
Oh.

08:56.245 --> 08:59.831
<i>♪ Music is mighty good ♪</i>

09:00.582 --> 09:05.128
<i>♪ See all the people come
from miles around ♪</i>

09:05.128 --> 09:06.046
Hi.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.924
<i>♪ Heard about the... ♪</i>

09:10.092 --> 09:11.969
Oh, hey, there's a person here.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.971
There's, uh, never a person.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.347
Hi, person.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.267
I'm Jenna. I'm Mr. Hogan's new assistant.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.478
This is where you say your name.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.189
Uh, Keith.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.816
Hi. Uh...

09:25.816 --> 09:29.444
Uh, what can I do for you happily?
Anything?

09:30.696 --> 09:33.573
Uh, this laptop belonged
to the last assistant.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.910
And there's a file on here
that won't open.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.453
Did you know the last assistant?

09:38.453 --> 09:41.373
Uh, no, I mostly stay down here.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.792
There's a lot of turnover and, uh, it's--

09:43.792 --> 09:45.627
you know,
it's kind of an intense place to work.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.754
I have noticed.

09:47.754 --> 09:52.009
Um, I used to wipe people's computers
after they left, but Brimley...

09:52.009 --> 09:53.635
- you know, from security?
- Mm-hmm.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.430
- Decided to take over. Huh.
- Hmm.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.640
Okay. It was a hidden text file.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.893
I mean, most of it is gibberish
because Brimley tried to wipe the drive.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.147
I--I can read some sentences.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.948
Mr. Hogan... did that to all these women?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.494
I need the last assistant's address.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.924
Hi, April. I'm Jenna.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.426
I found your file at Box 5 Music.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.345
Please, please,
don't close the door on me.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.346
I don't want any more trouble.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.139
Somebody's trying to silence you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.142
I know what that can do to a person.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.310
It eats you up from the inside.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.775
Thank you.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.362
I'm moving back home.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.406
Slinking away in defeat,
I guess you'd say.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.866
I would never say that.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.660
I tried, you know. I did.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.829
I told Carol.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.959
She said I misunderstood Hogan,
but it just kept happening.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.881
I don't know why
I started keeping the notes.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.132
I got stories,

11:14.132 --> 11:16.343
evidence from the other girls
at the office

11:16.343 --> 11:19.012
before they quit or got fired.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.932
I never really had a plan
for what to do with them.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.850
I just felt like...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.352
Somebody have to do something.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.105
One of the other women who got fired,

11:28.105 --> 11:31.983
she said she was contacting
a local lawyer,

11:31.983 --> 11:33.985
Harry something.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.655
Willis, Winslow, or...

11:36.655 --> 11:38.657
But I never heard anything.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.535
So I, um...

11:42.285 --> 11:44.121
took the severance payment.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.789
Hmm.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.545
I just wanna move on and forget about it.

11:56.174 --> 12:01.179
My, um, older sister, Quinn,

12:01.179 --> 12:05.016
eight years ago she was studying
to become a social worker.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.603
Uh, she had this professor

12:08.603 --> 12:12.691
that she saw as a mentor,
you know, at first.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.444
And then...

12:18.196 --> 12:20.323
she reported it to the school

12:21.324 --> 12:26.705
and they just, you know, said,
"He said, she said."

12:28.039 --> 12:31.626
And she tried to keep going
and she did for a few months.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.049
And eventually, she had to drop out.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.385
I'm so sorry.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.930
But I don't have any fight left.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.391
Then let me do the fighting.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.896
I just need you to trust me,
just a little bit.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.024
If you find more proof, I'll help.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.609
But where are you...

12:55.609 --> 12:57.277
Is this your severance check?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.738
Mm-hmm. More like hush money.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.824
Can I borrow this?

13:04.534 --> 13:05.619
Perfect.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.461
It's the wrong bank.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.172
I have no idea what that means, but okay.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.381
And why are we out here?

13:18.381 --> 13:20.425
So, no one inside hears us.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.678
Oh, we can use
that new food truck as cover.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.556
Okay. This isn't the same bank
that the company uses.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.726
Hogan's using an off-book account
to pay off the women that he harasses.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.436
How do you know that?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.771
Business degree.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.152
What'll it be, sweetheart?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.196
Uh, I'll have the gumbo, please.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.782
- Thank you.
- I'll just have what she's having.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.701
No kidding? I bet you will.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.204
If I can prove Hogan's
illegally moving funds around,

13:49.204 --> 13:52.374
the parent studio's lawyer
won't defend his NDAs.

13:52.374 --> 13:53.833
April and all the other women can testify.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.963
Look, I'm not the kind of person
who says, like, let the bad guys win.

13:57.963 --> 14:01.132
But what if you're right?
What will he do next?

14:01.132 --> 14:03.051
Hogan's a powerful guy.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.719
The power is the point, Keith.

14:04.719 --> 14:05.887
That's how he gets away with all this,

14:05.887 --> 14:07.806
through power and fear of that power.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.599
Hogan abuses women, he bullies them,

14:09.599 --> 14:11.768
and then through his NDAs,
he steals their voices,

14:11.768 --> 14:13.562
their future, their power.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.272
Thank you.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.606
Thank you.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.819
So... let's go steal it back.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.493
- I know what you're thinking.
- What?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.744
That she's a civilian.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.705
And that Hank Hogan
has been getting away

14:31.705 --> 14:34.457
with sexually assaulting women
just like Jenna for years.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.335
Yeah, and he bullies them into keeping
silent by using private detectives

14:37.335 --> 14:40.130
and these hired thugs
disguised as security.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.508
Not to mention the NDAs
that'll have them sued into oblivion

14:43.508 --> 14:44.968
if they dare to speak out.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.721
So it's safer to send Jenna on a cruise
around the world?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.974
- By force?
- No.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.684
Jenna wants to help
these young women,

14:52.684 --> 14:54.644
so we are gonna help her.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.312
<i>Your smile is very contagious, you know?</i>

15:37.312 --> 15:40.899
Oh, I just love your accent.
It's so European.

15:40.899 --> 15:41.816
Is it Belgian?

15:41.816 --> 15:42.984
- <i>Well...</i>
- No.

15:42.984 --> 15:46.321
There's some sexy
Liechtenstein in there.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.364
What?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.076
- Oh.
- <i>Hello?</i>

15:51.076 --> 15:52.369
I'm sorry, Hans.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.913
I--I'm gonna have to put you on hold
for a minute.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.124
<i>But, Carol...</i>

16:00.085 --> 16:02.379
I'm, uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.547
I got a memo about
a possible security breach

16:04.547 --> 16:08.968
and IT wanted everyone to install
these cyber security sweep things

16:08.968 --> 16:11.429
on their personal computers
to connect to the company server.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.807
I mean, I don't know.
It went way over my head.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.808
Oh, for God's sake.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.644
I'm not sticking a random thumb drive
in my computer

16:17.644 --> 16:21.564
because some Nebraskan high school
drama club treasurer tells me to do it.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.358
Vice president.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.151
Uh, okay. That's fine.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.529
I'll just tell IT you said no.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.906
But I know we got a lot
of trade secrets here,

16:29.906 --> 16:34.202
so I'd really hate for one of our secrets
to get out, but...

16:39.708 --> 16:42.001
Great. Bye.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.086
Yeah.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.049
<i>Be still my heart. There she is.</i>

16:54.222 --> 16:56.391
Ah!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.727
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.730
So Carol's computer syncs
through the calendar app

17:01.730 --> 17:03.398
to Brimley's and Hogan's.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.817
So, I'm in all three.

17:05.817 --> 17:09.571
- Um, how'd you get her to install it?
- Oh, she mocked drama club,

17:09.571 --> 17:11.573
but she succumbed
to my mad thespian skills.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.533
- Are you a thespian?
- Mm-hmm.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.619
Because I'm a thespian.
Like, I love thespians.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.580
I--well, I was.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.457
I still am. A thespian.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.128
Hmm.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.422
- Oh! What do we have?
- Oh.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.048
Do we have proof that Hogan
is moving our money?

17:29.048 --> 17:33.303
Uh, no.
Carol just downloaded another movie.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.763
Movie?

17:34.763 --> 17:38.224
Carol's hard drive is basically
illegally downloaded Hallmark movies.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.394
She likes the ones
where the guy is, like, a secret prince

17:41.394 --> 17:44.606
but he's living another life
in the States as a Christmas tree farmer,

17:44.606 --> 17:46.274
or a rancher, or a carpenter.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.986
Look. She is even on this dating app

17:49.986 --> 17:51.654
where she only picks working-class guys

17:51.654 --> 17:53.156
who speak with foreign accents.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.533
She's really trying to find a duke

17:55.533 --> 17:57.327
who's pretending to be a lumberjack?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.621
Carol appears to be
trying to manifest a lumberduke.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.538
Yes.

18:01.956 --> 18:06.169
And, uh, Brimley just has equally
detailed dossiers on everyone.

18:06.795 --> 18:07.796
What's in mine?

18:07.796 --> 18:09.380
I didn't read it.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.758
Of course you didn't. But Hogan?

18:11.758 --> 18:15.470
Unfortunately, he doesn't keep
any of his financials on his computer.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.138
- Hmm.
- I hate luddites.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.057
Yeah, when I talked to April,
she said that

18:19.057 --> 18:20.475
you're really in his inner circle

18:20.475 --> 18:22.227
when he lets you draw up a contract.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.645
I mean, that's when you get to see
the records.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.523
Okay. So, we got to get you
into his inner circle.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.775
Then, we'll get proof Hogan's dirty.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.362
But I am an assistant.
I mean, that's gonna take me years.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.281
- Oh.
- Oh.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.867
That's the place that Hogan
was having a music showcase tonight.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.785
Not anymore.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.247
They got shut down after all the customers
and performers got food poisoning.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.623
This is my chance.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.000
If I can find him another singer,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.752
I'll be the hero,
and then I can lever that

18:47.752 --> 18:49.337
into some access into his office.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.256
And I can find
where the bodies are buried.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.590
Cool.

18:52.590 --> 18:56.886
But how am I gonna find
a replacement singer?

18:56.886 --> 18:57.971
I...

19:01.391 --> 19:03.268
Hey, I got an alert from that food truck.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.937
They're outside again.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.314
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Yeah, definitely.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.067
Man, that venue closing,
how random was that?

19:11.943 --> 19:14.362
Yeah. How random was that?

19:21.911 --> 19:23.371
Hey. How can I help you?

19:23.371 --> 19:24.622
Two gumbos, please.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.584
Gumbo times two. On it.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.128
My treat this time.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.798

19:39.429 --> 19:40.763
Oh, no.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.098
I mean, I'm trying to be.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.225
Uh, my friends, they have this, uh,
performance space.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.518
I sing there a few nights a week.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.186
What kind of performance space?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.397
They just rebuilt it.
It's actually not far from here.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.859
Is it free tonight?
Are you performing there tonight?

19:52.859 --> 19:56.779
Yeah. I mean,
as a matter of fact, I am.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.906
I'll give you my number.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.449
If you are performing tonight,

one of the biggest music execs

20:02.160 --> 20:04.162

to come hear you sing.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.622
Deal.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.706
Awesome.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.170
Hello, sir.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.421
Uh, yes, sir.

20:13.421 --> 20:17.550
I saw the calendar notification
and I have a solution.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.302
And there's someone you should hear.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.095
She's singing tonight.

20:21.596 --> 20:22.889
Yes. I'm talking too much.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.558
Uh, but, yes, I have a venue.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.519
Wow. Uh, thank you.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.772
Thank you.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.359
He told me that I show great initiative

20:34.359 --> 20:36.069
and he wants me to be more involved
in the business.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.737
- Yes!
- And he wants me to go with him

20:37.737 --> 20:39.405
- to the showcase tonight.
- No.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.323
Jenna, you can't.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.158
I have to.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.618

22:46.949 --> 22:49.577
And this is my manager, Bridget.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.037
She also owns the bar.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.246
Oh.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.247
Pleasure to meet you.

22:53.247 --> 22:56.042
Oh. And you've met
my lovely assistant, Jenna?

22:56.042 --> 23:00.171
No, but charmed.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.339
Are you--are you all right?

23:01.339 --> 23:02.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.842
Um, you just remind me of someone.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.385
Oh.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.637
The woman from the food truck.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.182
Sorry. Uh, I think I misheard.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.935
I thought you said I look like
I work in a food truck.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.686
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not now.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.940
Um, and she has a New York accent.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.483
Right. Right.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.569
Well, you know, Bridget,
my very British...

23:23.569 --> 23:25.863
- British. Yeah. British.
- ...manager, she does look a lot

23:25.863 --> 23:27.615
like that lady I work with--
what's her name?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.909
- Susan, from Queens.
- Oh!

23:29.909 --> 23:31.536
Yeah, they do favor.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.788
- It's uncanny--that's not her, though.
- No, not me.

23:33.788 --> 23:37.458
- Definitely not.
- Wow. That is fascinating, ladies.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.794
But I think it's time
we talk some business.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.087
- Oh.
- Mm.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.965
Jenna, go get us a couple of fresh drinks.
Meet me outside.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.592
Oh, I was really hoping
to see this side of the business.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.387
Oh, yes. By all means, let her stay.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.640
Jenna is a great girl,
but this is above her level.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.308
Maybe next time, kiddo.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.980
Excuse me.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.606
She looked that much like her?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.483
Uh, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.861
You're under too much pressure.
You should have let me come.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.737
"Sure. I'd love to come to a bar with you,

24:06.737 --> 24:08.990
creepy predator man
who keeps perving on me

24:08.990 --> 24:09.949
and trying to get me to drink,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.909
so I have to pretend my diet Coke
is a Cuba Libre.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.912
Oh, hey, do you mind if I bring
the guy from IT as my date?"

24:14.912 --> 24:17.582
Well, it wouldn't have
been a date per se.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.500
- Unless, uh...
- Oh, shoot! He's coming.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.002
I got to go. Bye.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.088
Hey, how did it go?

24:24.088 --> 24:26.757
Ah, she owns the place,
and is looking to partner

24:26.757 --> 24:29.677
with somebody for a music festival.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.181
Local talent we can sign
before anybody else sees them.

24:33.181 --> 24:37.643
Great publicity and sweet,
sweet tax breaks from the state.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.271
Oh, that's amazing.

24:40.271 --> 24:43.107
- You've such an eye for opportunity.
- Mm-hmm.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.859
I have an eye for a lot of things.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.237
So, um, do you think I can be there
when you draw up the contracts?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.950
- You? God, You have such potential.
- Yeah.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.203
You are so eager.

24:55.203 --> 24:58.247
Oh, I love eager.

24:58.247 --> 25:01.375
- Eager about work? Yeah.
- Yeah, I love it. Yeah.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.045
Well, you see the thing about
making work work

25:04.045 --> 25:07.423
is finding the right mentor.

25:11.928 --> 25:13.721
Let me ask you something, Jenna.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.477
Do you want access
to the executive suites? Hmm?

25:20.394 --> 25:22.980
Do you wanna play in the big game?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.067
How far are you willing to go?

25:40.164 --> 25:41.749
What I mean is...

25:42.667 --> 25:46.629
if you can learn to get along
with pizza barefoot...

25:48.214 --> 25:52.718
if you could swallow bathing suits of...

25:52.718 --> 25:53.886
I'm sorry. What?

25:53.886 --> 25:58.224
Franco, Sarah, uh, um...

25:58.724 --> 26:00.685
Hmm.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.647
- Oh, there you are.
- Carol.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.900
- Carol!
- Oh, oopsie daisy.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.818
Oh, no.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.237
You don't look at all well.
Come on, let's sit down.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.406
There you go.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.491
I saw you.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.077
Darling, go to the bar and find someone
to stick him in a cab.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.787
- Stick him in a bag?
- Stick him in a cab.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.414
- Cab.
- Stick 'em up.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.127
Looks like your friend
can't handle his booze.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.296
I didn't think he had that much to drink.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.259
Did you just roofie a serial sex offender?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.094
Do tigers wear tutus?

26:38.097 --> 26:42.435
Regardless...
I also see a lot of potential in you,

26:43.102 --> 26:46.314
and I look forward to seeing
how you accomplish your next big job.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.400
You, you mean, as in the assistant job?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.819
In a manner of speaking, yes.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.988
Oh, there they go.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.285
Good luck.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.828
We'll be watching.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.755
Sylvia Hogan.

27:10.755 --> 27:13.716
Uh, Mrs. Hogan--ex-Mrs. Hogan.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.093
Um, no, he's not in right now.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.179
Uh, but I will let him know
that you called about the...

27:18.929 --> 27:20.973
Yes, I'm writing this down.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.185
The enormous check that he owes you

27:24.185 --> 27:25.644
and to send the money

27:25.644 --> 27:28.814
or you will burn down everything he loves.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.859
Yes. Got it. Okay.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.865
Car--oh, God.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.534
Carol.

27:43.079 --> 27:46.040
I found a new singer
and a new venue to boot.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.917
I need you to start processing contracts

27:47.917 --> 27:51.712
'cause we need to have
a regular showcase there.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.130
How did you find the venue?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.174
The kid and I went out last night.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.176
She found her.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.386
She's smart.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.347
And she can hold her booze.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.724
You went out with him last night?

28:03.724 --> 28:07.728
Uh, I was the one who found the singer.

28:07.728 --> 28:11.107
And if there are contracts
or financial agreements, I mean,

28:11.107 --> 28:12.650
I do have a business degree,

28:12.650 --> 28:15.277
and I would love to be a part
of that side of the company.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.573
I know exactly what you're trying to do.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.826
You're trying to worm your way up
the company

28:21.826 --> 28:23.536
without paying your dues.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.205
Every one of your generation is like this.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.457
- No. I promise...
- I spent five years

28:28.457 --> 28:29.959
sitting in an assistant's chair

28:29.959 --> 28:32.545
before I was invited to a proper meeting.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.131
And you will not get
to do management-level work

28:35.131 --> 28:36.757
as long as I'm around.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.304
Now... I'm gonna go get my laptop

28:42.304 --> 28:44.432
and process this paperwork with Hank.

28:45.224 --> 28:49.645
And you are not to go into his office.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.359
Get to work!

29:03.617 --> 29:06.829
Box 5 Music, Hank Hogan's Office.
How may I help you?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.956
Hey, how'd it go?

29:08.956 --> 29:10.207
Fine except...

29:10.207 --> 29:11.709
Wait, did you hear that?

29:11.709 --> 29:13.169
That, that click?

29:13.169 --> 29:15.880
Yeah. Something weird has been going on
with the phone lines.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.381
I saw that maintenance woman

29:17.381 --> 29:19.633
down at the junction box again
this morning.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.427
And anyway, what's the except?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.678
Carol.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.763
I mean, as long as she's around,
there's no way I'm getting anywhere near

29:24.763 --> 29:26.724
any of those financial documents.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.893
Sorry. I don't know what to do.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.562
I can't just make Carol disappear.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.063
Oh.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.816
There's that sound again.

29:58.672 --> 29:59.798
Ugh.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.053
Where the hell is Carol?

30:04.053 --> 30:05.971
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Hogan.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.433
Okay. Well, we need to start
those contracts.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.771
And I ain't doing them, so get in here.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.483
Let's go, Ms. Business Degree.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.994
It's a little dark in here.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.205
Yeah.

30:32.373 --> 30:35.584
Apparently, that tequila
was way off-brand last night.

30:37.127 --> 30:41.173
Uh, the Brit manager emailed me.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.803
For some reason... she wants
the paperwork done this morning.

30:46.470 --> 30:50.474
And she wants you as number two
on the contract for her singer.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.477
That's our standard contract.

30:54.645 --> 30:55.688
This is your big shot.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.774
I won't waste it.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.156
You know...

31:08.033 --> 31:10.119
I meant what I...

31:10.119 --> 31:12.204
...what I said last night.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.126
If you could...

31:18.002 --> 31:19.253
You really should, uh...

31:20.546 --> 31:22.673
learn to get along with people like me.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.262
- Something wrong?
- Nope.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.896
Why don't we have a drink?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.523
I mean, that way we could celebrate
your first contract.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.276
Maybe I should review these contracts
back at my desk.

31:42.276 --> 31:45.029
It's okay. It's fine.

31:45.029 --> 31:47.239
Oh, whoopsie. Sorry, maintenance.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.033
I got a call about
some flickering light.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.242
That was locked.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.785
Yeah. Well...

31:51.785 --> 31:54.622
There's no light flick--oh, my God.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.123
Oh.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.750
Should only take about a half-hour,

31:57.750 --> 32:03.297
- maybe an hour, or two.
- God. No. Let's go, please.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.800
- Stop. Will you wait till I leave, please?
- Whoa!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.802
Oh, you got some black mold up here.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.889
Did you know about that?
We're gonna have to call a plumber.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.182
I'm gonna get some coffee.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.100
Do some damage on these

32:15.100 --> 32:17.394
and we'll restart
when this racket's gone.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.113
What do you have there?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.865
Just some forms that Mr. Hogan gave me.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.201
Hogan gave you forms and said
you could leave the office with them?

32:32.201 --> 32:33.661
Well, no, but he didn't say that...

32:33.661 --> 32:36.288
No company documents
leave the office, ever.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.459
Situation in the bullpen.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.252
Well, my scanner is broken,

32:42.252 --> 32:44.963
so I figured that I would just
take these down to IT

32:44.963 --> 32:46.465
and scan them back up to my computer.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.883
And Hogan cleared that?

32:47.883 --> 32:49.885
Well, he...

32:50.344 --> 32:52.429
Sylvia? Where is she?

32:54.390 --> 32:55.808
This is the situation?

32:55.808 --> 32:57.351
Sneaking off with files, sir.

32:57.351 --> 32:58.727
Said she's gonna scan them.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.062
What the hell, Brimley?

33:00.062 --> 33:03.190
So she's taken some papers to scan--
let her scan them.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.110
Who cares?

33:06.902 --> 33:09.780
I have to find a dark room
and a cold towel.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.834
Mulligan, the new girl, Jenna,

33:21.834 --> 33:23.544
she's headed down to IT.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.380
Go down there. Keep an eye on her.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.216
Oh!

33:29.216 --> 33:30.843
The live performance contracts.

33:30.843 --> 33:31.802
Come again?

33:31.802 --> 33:33.804
Hogan structures
the live performance contracts

33:33.804 --> 33:36.598
so he charges for promotion
and overhead at the door.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.308
I mean, before he reports it to the label,

33:38.308 --> 33:40.686
that way he can--
he can skim through what he wants,

33:40.686 --> 33:43.313
run it through an off-book LLC,
and the label has no idea.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.065
That's how he's getting
the money for payoffs.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.692
If the label finds out he's stealing,

33:46.692 --> 33:48.610
- like you said, there's no way that...
- No way they'll be able

33:48.610 --> 33:50.279
to enforce the NDAs to protect him.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.781
If they actually arrest him
for the financial crimes,

33:52.781 --> 33:55.659
like, that could get him off the street,
he can't hurt anybody,

33:55.659 --> 33:58.245
and the cops have time
to gather evidence of the sex crimes.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.247
Keith, that--that's super smart thinking.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.292
I listen to a lot of true crime podcasts
on my bike to work.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.629
Um, but we need more than just forms.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.965
And we need to find the name
of the LLC he's using

34:09.965 --> 34:11.133
and find the records.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.469
I mean, but he keep nothing online, right?

34:13.469 --> 34:14.636
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

34:14.636 --> 34:15.804
...it must all be on on here.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.516
I need to get into that safe.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.893
You'd have to be in there alone

34:20.893 --> 34:23.896
with nobody else around to walk in on you.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.063
How are you gonna do that?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.283
Fire alarm?

34:36.283 --> 34:38.327
- How random is that?
- How random is that?

34:39.369 --> 34:40.454
- Hmm.
- Uh...

34:41.789 --> 34:44.208
Uh, according to the system,
it--it's not a false alarm,

34:44.208 --> 34:46.960
but there's also no fire or smoke
that's been detected.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.087
It must be that weird electrical problem
we've been having.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.672
This is my chance.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.675
It's a combination safe.
How are you gonna get into it?

34:53.675 --> 34:56.512
Well, he probably keeps the combination,
I mean, somewhere in his office,

34:56.512 --> 34:58.222
or on his emails, or files. Okay.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.973
You hack those. I'm heading up there.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.475
What if there's a real fire?

35:02.226 --> 35:04.645
If there is, it'll take a while
to get to Hogan's office,

35:04.645 --> 35:05.729
and I can just jump out a window.

35:05.729 --> 35:06.814
I mean, it's not that high up.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.232
I'll probably just break my ankles.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.775
You're kind of amazing.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.569
Thank you.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.073
Oh. Can you also turn off
the notifications

35:16.073 --> 35:17.950
for Hogan's camera
and shut the cameras down?

35:17.950 --> 35:19.993
Yeah, probably,
it's a pretty basic system.

35:20.494 --> 35:21.745
Okay. You got this.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.539
I'm counting on you.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.291
- Oh, wait.
- Yeah.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.296
- What's this?
- Uh, something I've rigged up,

35:31.296 --> 35:32.798
so we can hear each other.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.093
Oh, it's a--it's a little staticky.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.554
Well, I could do better
with unlimited money,

35:38.554 --> 35:41.139
a tech genius,
and access to futuristic technology.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.683
But, you know, who has time for that?

35:42.683 --> 35:44.893
It's great. Thank you for having my back.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.979
I just want you to be safe.

35:49.273 --> 35:50.274
Okay.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.278
I'll take it.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.240
So there's no fire?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.325
Still trying to confirm that, sir.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.202
By the way, where's your assistant?

36:02.202 --> 36:04.538
I don't know. She's a butterfly.

36:04.538 --> 36:05.914
Ask Carol.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.583
Carol's not here, sir.

36:07.583 --> 36:08.584
What?

36:08.584 --> 36:10.335
Where the hell could she be?

36:11.712 --> 36:16.133
Does your family support
your lumberjack lifestyle?

36:16.133 --> 36:17.050
Hmm.

36:18.343 --> 36:23.223
My soul loves to be alone in nature,

36:23.223 --> 36:25.893
amongst the trees,
with the wolves

36:25.893 --> 36:29.354
and the hawks,
away from the world.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.356
I get that. I get that.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.774
But sadly, no.

36:32.774 --> 36:36.236
My family does not support my rugged,

36:36.236 --> 36:38.280
forest-oriented lifestyle.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.448
Why not?

36:39.448 --> 36:40.699
It's complicated.

36:40.699 --> 36:44.912
My father wants me to go
into the family business.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.664
It stretches back many generations.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.084
My grandmama calls it the firm.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.172
Security, all eyes,

36:55.172 --> 36:58.091
I need you to find
Hogan's new assistant, Jenna Monroe.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.135
Grab and bring her here.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.820
Keith, any luck with the combination?

37:18.820 --> 37:21.365
His office cameras are down,
alerts are off,

37:21.365 --> 37:23.367
but, uh, no, nothing for the safe yet.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.577
Keith, I have faith in you.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.092
Huh.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.180
This is weird.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.600
- Stay here, sir. I'll go call Carol again.
- Yeah.

37:50.644 --> 37:53.313
Hans, it's no use.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.567
I know... you're not just a lumberjack.

37:57.567 --> 37:58.735
You're a Belgian prince.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.905
But--no, my secret.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.200
There aren't that many
active monarchies anymore.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.661
Plus your accent.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.329
Don't worry.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.873
Your secret is safe with me.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.543
You are a remarkable woman,

38:14.543 --> 38:19.423
a commoner, but with the heart of a queen.

38:19.423 --> 38:23.051
Tell me about Belgium.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.303
Of course.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.433
Belgium is a place I know well.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.958
I'm looking for a piece of paper,

38:54.958 --> 38:57.961
anything with a combination.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.129
I'm coming up empty.

39:00.464 --> 39:01.506
I think I got lucky.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.301
I'm... I'm sending you a link.
It was in my feed.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.927
<i>Hey, guys, what is happening?</i>

39:05.927 --> 39:07.387
<i>So, turns out you got yourself</i>

39:07.387 --> 39:10.891
<i>a Glenn-Rieder FR 1760 combination safe.</i>

39:10.891 --> 39:13.018
<i>Let's teach you how to crack this baby.</i>

39:13.018 --> 39:14.186
<i>Just in case.</i>

39:15.645 --> 39:19.024
<i>First thing you're gonna wanna do
is get familiar with the wheel.</i>

39:19.024 --> 39:22.402
<i>You know, give it a turn,
listen to those clicks.</i>

39:22.402 --> 39:24.821
<i>These are gonna be pitched in B major</i>

39:24.821 --> 39:27.449
<i>with a slight pre-click
on the combination numbers.</i>

39:27.449 --> 39:30.744
<i>Now, Glenn-Rieder's
typically go left, right, left.</i>

39:30.744 --> 39:33.830
<i>So go ahead and give it
three full turns to the left...</i>

39:35.248 --> 39:36.958
<i>and then listen for that pre-click.</i>

39:36.958 --> 39:39.294
Oh! The internet. What doesn't it have?

39:39.294 --> 39:44.257
Bruges is really like a fairytale land.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.468
Uh, it--it's cobblestone streets

39:46.468 --> 39:49.513
and, uh, swans, mm-hmm.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.432
- And...
- Excuse me.

39:53.475 --> 39:58.146
Oh, my.
Uh, there's a fire at my workplace.

39:58.146 --> 40:01.316
I'm so sorry. Um, I have to go.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.069
But-but-but you are my-my-my queen.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.488
Remain here, my sweet prince.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.240
I shall return.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.244
Ha-ha-ha.

40:12.994 --> 40:17.207
So a lumberduke, huh?
Wow.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.549
Keith, what's going on?

40:26.216 --> 40:29.845
Uh, the fire alarm's off
and I can't find a way to restart it.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.722
People are coming back in.
Do you have the safe open yet?

40:33.390 --> 40:37.811
No, it's not, okay?
We need to at least stall Hogan.

40:37.811 --> 40:40.147
Keith, I'm gonna send you a phone number.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.693
Carol? Where are you?

40:44.693 --> 40:45.986
Sylvia?

40:49.406 --> 40:50.866
Sylvia. Hi.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.909
Hi. How'd you get this number?

40:52.909 --> 40:55.036
No, no, no, no, no. You don't have to sue.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.330
I have the money. I can get it to you.

40:57.330 --> 41:00.292
Yes. Please don't call any more lawyers.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.629
- Oh.
- <i>What happened?</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:08.967
Uh, I must have done it.
I just didn't hear the tumblers click.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.260
Ah...

41:13.763 --> 41:14.764
Any luck?

41:14.764 --> 41:17.309
Yes. Yes.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.603
There's an entry for April's check here,

41:19.603 --> 41:20.937
and a bunch of others.

41:23.356 --> 41:26.443
And this is the LLC he's using
to money-launder his payments.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.069
Keith, I need you to tell me
everything you can

41:28.069 --> 41:30.238
about Black Dog Limited Music.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.865
It was incorporated in Delaware.

41:31.865 --> 41:34.034
This shell company is proof
that he's stealing

41:34.034 --> 41:35.744
from the parent label
and paying off his victims.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.258
I knew you were a little troublemaker.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.680
You really like calling
other women "little," don't you?

41:55.680 --> 41:59.351
Well, I'm the only one
with any backbone around here.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.604
You know, at first,

42:02.604 --> 42:06.900
when you were trying to keep me away
from Hogan and out of his office,

42:06.900 --> 42:09.194
I thought you were defending
your territory.

42:11.112 --> 42:15.408
But I think you were protecting me,
trying to keep me safe.

42:15.408 --> 42:18.203
No matter what
you helped him cover up in the past...

42:19.371 --> 42:21.122
you protected me.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.918
And somewhere in there,
you still have a conscience.

42:25.669 --> 42:27.128
And you know that the women that he hurt,

42:27.128 --> 42:29.214
that they deserve justice.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.635
You can still make things right.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.600
You need to come down
from planet Nebraska, wide eyes.

42:41.518 --> 42:44.604
The only reason
I was keeping Hogan from you

42:44.604 --> 42:48.775
is because I knew you would just be
one other mess I had to clean up.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.152
April was bad enough.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.863
You're just one more stupid,

42:53.863 --> 42:57.784
wounded baby bird
I'd have to scrape off the pavement.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.329
What the hell is going on here?

43:01.788 --> 43:03.748
I found her stealing documents
from the safe.

43:03.748 --> 43:04.833
Where's Brimley?

43:04.833 --> 43:06.918
He's not picking up his phone.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.672
We'll handle this ourselves.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.841
<i>Tell Carol
to look at the LLC papers.</i>

43:12.841 --> 43:13.758
What?

43:13.758 --> 43:15.051
<i>It'd normally take me a couple of hours</i>

43:15.051 --> 43:16.636
to run down the name of the company
that you gave me,

43:16.636 --> 43:18.596
but I just happened to discover

43:18.596 --> 43:21.057
<i>an email in Hogan's account mentioning it.</i>

43:21.057 --> 43:21.975
<i>It's weird, really.</i>

43:21.975 --> 43:23.268
Keith.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.146
Keith? What, that little creep in IT?

43:28.064 --> 43:30.442
You both are gonna end up
in a dumpster for this.

43:30.442 --> 43:33.695
Tell Carol to look at whose name
is on the LLC papers.

43:34.529 --> 43:35.697
- Look at the papers.
- Give me that.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.324
Look at whose name's on them.

43:39.034 --> 43:40.201
Everything's in my name.

43:40.201 --> 43:42.329
Yeah, it's just to include you.

43:42.329 --> 43:44.789
Embezzlement's kind of
a short-term crime, huh?

43:45.373 --> 43:47.250
I mean, it always comes out at some point,

43:47.250 --> 43:50.420
so it's important to have an escape plan,

43:50.420 --> 43:52.714
like pinning it on your partner.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.343
- You son of a bitch.
- Carol!

43:56.343 --> 43:57.510
No, you don't understand.

43:57.510 --> 43:58.678
This was--this is for you.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.513
Excuse me, folks.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.807
It was him. It was all him.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.225
- He abuses women.
- What?!

44:04.225 --> 44:06.770
He steals. I can prove all of it.

44:06.770 --> 44:09.314
Prove?
The cameras weren't even on.

44:09.314 --> 44:13.777
Oh, I kept my own notes, just in case.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.528
And these documents prove embezzlement.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.697
Whatever I'm guilty of,
she's guilty of, too.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.616
How would she know about the embezzlement?

44:19.616 --> 44:21.618
Look, look, everything is in her name.

44:21.618 --> 44:25.246
I was going to say we're here
investigating a fire alarm.

44:26.706 --> 44:30.877
But you're both accusing each other
of embezzlement and theft.

44:30.877 --> 44:32.545
- He assaults women!
- She stole everything!

44:32.545 --> 44:36.007
Everyone can tell their side
of the story down at the station.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.978
Now that I knew what I was looking for,

44:48.978 --> 44:51.564
turns out somebody doesn't always
turn off his cameras.

44:52.273 --> 44:54.818
He likes to keep trophies.

44:54.818 --> 44:57.195
I have evidence Mr. Hogan here
is guilty of multiple assaults

44:57.195 --> 44:58.279
on female employees.

44:59.489 --> 45:01.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sir.

45:02.325 --> 45:03.576
You're fired.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.955
Come down for a routine fire alarm

45:06.955 --> 45:08.915
and leave with the biggest bust
of our careers.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.084
How random is that?

45:20.385 --> 45:21.886
I heard Hogan bailed out,

45:21.886 --> 45:23.179
but he has an ankle monitor.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.140
He can't make a move
without the cops knowing.

45:25.140 --> 45:28.143
Yeah. The label dropped him so fast,
they left skid marks.

45:28.143 --> 45:30.228
And you don't have to worry
about the NDAs.

45:30.228 --> 45:33.106
So you can tell your story now,
if you want.

45:33.106 --> 45:34.774
I'll never be able to thank you.

45:34.774 --> 45:37.402
I feel like I can breathe
for the first time in weeks.

45:39.028 --> 45:41.865
But I'm so sorry that you lost your jobs.

45:41.865 --> 45:44.617
I can code.
I'll always be able to find a job.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.578
Yeah. And after,
I mean, the last few days,

45:46.578 --> 45:50.331
I still love music, but I don't know
if I'm gonna jump right back

45:50.331 --> 45:51.833
into an assistant job.

45:51.833 --> 45:54.461
All I can say is you're both
pretty special.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.380
So many people owe you so much.

45:58.548 --> 46:00.133
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.472
I can't believe you pulled it off.

46:05.472 --> 46:07.974
I can't believe we pulled it off.

46:07.974 --> 46:11.144
The assistant and the IT guy,
it's pretty cool, huh?

46:11.144 --> 46:12.645
We took down a monster.

46:12.645 --> 46:16.107
I still can't help but feel
we got really lucky.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.358
Hey, give us some credit.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.402
Uh, we kicked ass,
we achieved the impossible,

46:19.402 --> 46:20.570
just the two of us.

46:20.570 --> 46:21.905
All right. Keep that confidence up

46:21.905 --> 46:24.699
because I don't think we're getting
references from our last bosses.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.409
Oh, no. No.

46:26.409 --> 46:29.746
Yeah, and I don't know about you,
but I have rent due, so...

46:29.746 --> 46:32.874
Oh, hey, I did, uh, find one thing.

46:32.874 --> 46:33.875
Oh.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.296
I found it
when I was clearing out stuff.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.716
I think it belonged to April,
but I figured if she had it,

46:41.716 --> 46:43.801
maybe they're in the same business.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.679
We could call them.

46:46.679 --> 46:48.389
We could call them?

46:49.724 --> 46:51.684
We make a pretty good team.

47:10.662 --> 47:13.831
<i>♪ I don't believe in fairy tales ♪</i>

47:13.831 --> 47:17.126
<i>♪ Least what the old ones say ♪</i>

47:41.734 --> 47:44.195
We did everything right,
but the job went bad.

47:47.282 --> 47:48.783
Now they wanna come to London
and punch necks!

47:48.783 --> 47:50.326
We're going to London.

47:50.326 --> 47:51.244
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47:51.244 --> 47:52.537
Cheerio.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.040
Appears to be the scene of the crime.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.960
<i>Who is Inspector Astrid Pickford?</i>

47:58.960 --> 48:01.671
<i>She considers me a nemesis.
I have a lot of nemesises.</i>

48:01.671 --> 48:04.591
I just don't have time
to nemesis them all back.

48:04.591 --> 48:05.800
My, my.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.135
Hello, Ramsey.

48:07.135 --> 48:08.845
I am taking Ramsey down.

48:08.845 --> 48:10.388
What's the plan?

48:10.388 --> 48:11.973
We need to go. Now.
