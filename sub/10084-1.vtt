01:04.099 --> 01:09.770
Moving on to the last name on the list,
Lt Cmdr Thomas Dodge.

01:09.856 --> 01:14.683
Third in his class at sub school.
Did even better in the advanced course.

01:14.777 --> 01:18.857
Cited for tactical excellence,
joint NATO exercise.

01:23.995 --> 01:26.237
180 and closing, sir.

01:26.330 --> 01:31.917
- Ahead one-third, steady on course.
- Ahead one-third, steady on course. Aye, sir.

01:32.003 --> 01:36.415
- Target at 175 and closing, sir.
- Let's try a shot.

01:36.507 --> 01:40.457
This is the third time
Tom Dodge has come up for command.

01:40.553 --> 01:44.253
If we don't give him a boat, he'll be
dropped from the command programme,

01:44.348 --> 01:46.305
which would be a tragedy for him

01:46.392 --> 01:50.970
and a mistake for us, given the years
and dollars spent training him.

01:51.063 --> 01:54.148
Well, I'd have to disagree with you,
Admiral Price.

01:54.233 --> 01:58.017
Dodge's fitness report
also presents a man who three years ago

01:58.112 --> 02:02.062
brushed against a Russian
missile sub just off Murmansk.

02:02.158 --> 02:04.695
Not exactly a promotional bell-ringer.

02:04.785 --> 02:08.533
Target at 160, sir. Five-knot aiding wind.

02:09.414 --> 02:12.866
- Delivery seven.
- We have a shooting solution.

02:12.960 --> 02:18.167
More to the point, I simply don't
approve of his command style.

02:18.257 --> 02:21.875
He's impulsive. He's often undisciplined,
even reckless at times.

02:21.969 --> 02:24.045
Fire one!

02:26.223 --> 02:29.758
Get up there, you miserable little puke.

02:33.230 --> 02:34.143
<i>(whistles)</i>

02:34.231 --> 02:36.804
It's a fine shot, sir.

02:37.151 --> 02:41.563
Well, what the heck?
Why don't we pull in so you can putt out?

02:46.785 --> 02:52.076
I will simply remind the selection board
of one irrefutable fact

02:52.165 --> 02:54.917
that seems to sum up Dodge's character.

02:55.002 --> 03:00.755
There is physical evidence that as an ensign
Dodge became so physically intoxicated

03:00.841 --> 03:05.218
that he not only allowed
himself to be tattooed,

03:05.303 --> 03:08.139
but tattooed on his genitalia.

03:09.516 --> 03:14.225
Now, call me a prude if you want,
but I don't think it's good policy for the navy

03:14.312 --> 03:17.847
to hand over a billion-dollar
piece of equipment

03:17.941 --> 03:22.650
to a man who has "Welcome Aboard"
tattooed on his penis.

03:38.795 --> 03:42.662
After 80 days under the ice pack
I thought some recreation might be in order.

03:42.757 --> 03:46.375
- Priority message, sir.
- I was not endangering the boat.

03:46.469 --> 03:51.677
Your actions were totally inappropriate.
It's not the way a prospective captain acts.

03:51.766 --> 03:54.436
A failing noted more than once in your fit rep.

03:54.519 --> 03:59.679
As much as I like to see my men advance,
I have an obligation to be as honest as I can.

03:59.774 --> 04:04.483
- Then I'm in trouble.
- This is entirely of your own making.

04:06.281 --> 04:10.693
This is a confirmed kill.
20 years down the fucking drain.

04:10.785 --> 04:14.403
Watch your language, Dodge.
You know how I hate that.

04:14.497 --> 04:18.709
Gee, now I've gone and done it.
Ruined my career!

04:20.128 --> 04:22.749
Apparently not.

04:25.591 --> 04:28.343
This is just in from COMSUBLANT.

04:28.428 --> 04:32.259
You are to report to Norfolk immediately.

04:32.348 --> 04:35.219
- To command your own submarine.
- That's not funny.

04:35.309 --> 04:39.354
No, it's not. That's why they decoded it twice.

04:49.115 --> 04:51.606
Congratulations.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.910
<i>(triumphant cry)</i>

05:09.927 --> 05:12.335
¶ Oh, yeah!

05:12.429 --> 05:16.641
I just hope they have one in turquoise.
Thank you!

05:19.728 --> 05:23.180
It's good to see you again, Dodge.
Been about four years.

05:23.274 --> 05:26.856
Something like that, sir.
Not since we were both at Kings Bay.

05:26.944 --> 05:32.365
Well, you're about to join
the elite of the submarine service.

05:32.449 --> 05:36.696
- The best the United States Navy has to offer.
- Damn good feeling, sir.

05:36.787 --> 05:40.950
As a matter of fact, there she is right now.

05:42.501 --> 05:44.992
Your new boat.

05:48.674 --> 05:53.419
<i>USS Stingray. SS 161.</i>

05:54.096 --> 05:56.053
That?

05:56.139 --> 06:00.386
- This can't be my boat, sir.
- Well, it most certainly is.

06:00.477 --> 06:06.812
- Balao class, refitted 1958.
- Balao class? But that's a diesel sub.

06:06.900 --> 06:12.025
- The navy doesn't even use diesels any more.
- They do now. She's been recommissioned.

06:12.114 --> 06:16.776
<i>No disrespect to the USS Rustoleum here,
but I'd be better off in the Merrimack.</i>

06:16.868 --> 06:21.779
- I was trained to command a nuclear boat.
- Are you refusing to take command?

06:24.042 --> 06:26.711
- No, sir.
- Good.

06:26.795 --> 06:31.872
- Meet your crew here tomorrow at 0700.
- They also left over from World War Two, sir?

06:31.967 --> 06:34.006
No, Captain.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.554
They've been handpicked... by me.

06:41.393 --> 06:42.851
Come on in.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.435
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Admiral Winslow.

06:46.523 --> 06:48.930
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

06:50.402 --> 06:55.028
- Well, how do you like your boat?
- It's a complete piece of...

06:57.033 --> 06:59.702
antiquated equipment, sir.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.866
I have dedicated a substantial portion
of my life to getting my own boat.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.626
I was wondering why
you chose to embarrass me.

07:06.709 --> 07:11.455
No embarrassment intended.
You've been chosen for a specific mission.

07:11.548 --> 07:15.628
To turn her into a museum, sir?
The Wonderful World Of Corrosion?

07:15.718 --> 07:17.628
Hardly.

07:17.720 --> 07:23.307
Here are recent satellite photos of Russian
bases at Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok.

07:23.393 --> 07:27.342
That's where the Russians
have got their diesel sub fleet.

07:27.438 --> 07:32.266
But each week they're fewer because
they're selling them off like hot cakes

07:32.360 --> 07:35.563
to countries like Iran,
Iraq and Libya, to name a few.

07:35.655 --> 07:40.613
With respect, sir, one American nuclear
attack sub could defeat several diesels.

07:40.701 --> 07:43.489
In conventional battle, certainly that's true.

07:43.579 --> 07:49.748
What if you had one renegade diesel captain
who decided to hit us without warning,

07:49.836 --> 07:53.536
a terrorist intent on getting
a nuclear warhead into a harbour?

07:53.631 --> 07:57.296
Do you think we could catch and kill
a bogie like that in time?

07:57.385 --> 07:59.508
Absolutely, sir.

07:59.595 --> 08:03.759
Well, most of the admiralty,
they would agree with you.

08:03.849 --> 08:06.803
But me, personally, I'd like to know for sure.

08:06.894 --> 08:11.390
<i>That's why you'll clean up the Stingray
and take her out off the Atlantic coast</i>

08:11.482 --> 08:13.938
for a series of war games.

08:14.026 --> 08:18.487
One rebel diesel against the US nuclear navy.

08:18.572 --> 08:20.648
Come on.

08:23.577 --> 08:26.662
First you'll attempt to invade
Charleston harbour.

08:26.747 --> 08:29.534
If you're good enough
to evade further pursuit,

08:29.625 --> 08:34.251
you're going to attempt to sink shipping
right here at the naval base in Norfolk.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.376
Simulated, of course.

08:36.465 --> 08:39.881
- What do you think?
- I think I'm gonna get my ass kicked, sir.

08:39.969 --> 08:43.634
Don't think like that.
Damn it to hell, don't go by the book.

08:43.722 --> 08:48.717
Think like a pirate.
I want a man with a tattoo on his dick.

08:48.811 --> 08:51.302
Have I got the right man?

08:52.272 --> 08:54.479
By a strange coincidence you do, sir.

08:54.566 --> 09:00.901
However, the task you've given me here
is close to impossible.

09:01.782 --> 09:06.076
If I pull it off, that is get both ports...

09:07.454 --> 09:09.910
I would like command of
my own nuclear sub.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.668
- Setting terms now?
- No, sir.

09:12.751 --> 09:17.080
But without command, once this exercise
is over I'm headed for a deskjob,

09:17.172 --> 09:19.248
which means I'm out of the navy.

09:19.341 --> 09:25.095
I can't make you any guarantees, Dodge,
but this is what I'll do.

09:25.180 --> 09:30.138
I'll give you two live torpedoes.
I'll set a dummy ship in Norfolk harbour.

09:30.227 --> 09:33.560
If I see that baby go up,
then we'll talk about your boat.

09:33.897 --> 09:35.391
Thank you, sir.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.535
Nice pants. Lose the cigar.

09:49.621 --> 09:52.194
You better burn that shirt, sailor.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.781
It's the crew from hell.

09:56.044 --> 10:00.421
<i>Good morning, sir! Martin G Pascal,
Executive Officer of the Stingray, sir!</i>

10:00.507 --> 10:03.128
- Do you come with a volume control?
- Sir?

10:03.218 --> 10:05.424
Lt Commander Tom Dodge.

10:05.512 --> 10:09.675
- You're kind of young for an XO.
- Excellence knows no age, sir.

10:09.766 --> 10:11.924
What do you think about our boat?

10:12.018 --> 10:14.639
I need a tetanus shotjust from looking at it.

10:14.729 --> 10:18.727
The only thing holding her together
are the bird droppings, sir.

10:18.817 --> 10:23.728
We have our crew here, I see.
What do you say we board them?

10:23.821 --> 10:27.771
Yes, sir. Seaman Stanley Sylvesterson, sir!

10:29.410 --> 10:32.744
- Welcome aboard, Sylves-terson.
- Sylvesterson, sir.

10:32.830 --> 10:36.662
- Though my friends call me Spots.
- Spots.

10:37.919 --> 10:40.955
I'm a bit of a gambler, sir.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.795
What happened to your shoes?

10:43.883 --> 10:46.967
Ever bet on a sure thing
and the horse gets a cramp, sir?

10:47.053 --> 10:49.092
- Grab a bunk.
- Thank you, sir.

10:51.099 --> 10:55.013
- Next.
- Hey, get your hands off of me!

10:57.063 --> 11:00.229
Oh, good. Our chaplain has arrived.

11:01.984 --> 11:06.064
Sonar Technician, Second Class,
ET Lovacelli, sir!

11:07.114 --> 11:10.863
- Goes under the name "Sonar".
- Welcome aboard, Sonar.

11:10.952 --> 11:16.456
Excuse me, sir.
This is an actual navy submarine?

11:16.540 --> 11:20.918
- Not a float in a parade or something?
- I'm afraid so, Sonar.

11:23.005 --> 11:24.914
Isn't that odd.

11:25.007 --> 11:27.676
Don't tell me. Deaf as Beethoven.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.508
Oh, no. Great ears, sir.
Watch what you say around him.

11:31.597 --> 11:35.346
He hears everything. His last CO
thought he was a security problem.

11:35.434 --> 11:42.053
Excuse me, sir, I don't hear everything.
And I'm quite trustworthy too.

11:43.234 --> 11:45.310
Right.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.357
Shoot.

11:50.449 --> 11:54.447
Engine Man, First Class, Brad Stepanak!

11:56.538 --> 11:58.614
Sit on it and rotate, sir.

11:58.707 --> 12:02.159
What did you say, sailor? You can't say that.

12:02.252 --> 12:06.416
- He can't say that!
- Pascal, down. Heel.

12:06.507 --> 12:10.919
By the code of military justice,
that constitutes gross insubordination,

12:11.011 --> 12:15.009
punishable by one month in the brig.
I'm ready to go, sir.

12:15.098 --> 12:19.891
- Board the boat. I like a challenge.
- You'll throw me off within a week.

12:19.978 --> 12:22.220
I'm a dedicated pain in the butt, sir.

12:22.314 --> 12:24.390
- Stepanak.
- What?

12:25.734 --> 12:30.610
If I throw you off,
it'll be in the middle of the Atlantic.

12:31.281 --> 12:35.445
- Board the damn boat.
- Oh, man.

12:35.535 --> 12:38.026
What's our mission, rescue Gilligan?

12:38.121 --> 12:40.280
- You're mine, maggot!
- Ha!

12:40.374 --> 12:43.043
I love this job.

12:43.126 --> 12:45.368
And who's our next contestant?

12:46.922 --> 12:48.831
<i>(groaning)</i>

12:48.924 --> 12:52.340
Sorry. The name's Buckman.

12:52.427 --> 12:54.965
- Nitro, hi.
- Interesting nickname.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.094
What's your real name?

12:57.182 --> 12:59.174
Nitro.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.138
- I'm working on a nickname, though.
- Oh, yeah?

13:02.228 --> 13:04.601
Listen to this.

13:04.689 --> 13:06.349
Mike.

13:10.862 --> 13:14.196
- You're Stoneball Jackson.
- Who you calling Stoneball?

13:14.282 --> 13:17.034
I lost a grand on that
army game, butterfingers.

13:17.118 --> 13:21.163
For your information, I was mugged.
Gaines was all over me that play.

13:21.247 --> 13:23.406
I saw that play. I saw the replay.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.912
There was nobody near you but the mascot,
and he could have made that lay-up.

13:28.004 --> 13:31.171
That's cute. But it's on now.

13:48.858 --> 13:52.725
Small, but... filthy.

13:57.116 --> 13:59.323
Come in.

14:00.453 --> 14:03.074
Hell of a day, huh, Marty?

14:03.164 --> 14:07.873
It's not over yet, sir. Lt Lake is here.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.875
- Show him a bunk.
- There's a problem, sir.

14:12.632 --> 14:16.581
Lt Lake reporting for duty, sir.
And there's no problem.

14:19.722 --> 14:22.509
I get it. Please, don't take off your clothes.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.929
It's nice of the guys to get me a stripper,
but I got a lot of work to do.

14:27.021 --> 14:30.805
Thank you.
Nice job on that uniform though.

14:31.650 --> 14:34.687
I am not a stripper, sir.

14:34.779 --> 14:39.156
I am Lt Emily Lake,
your new dive officer.

14:39.241 --> 14:44.069
Well, that's impossible. They must be
confusing you with Emilio Lake.

14:44.163 --> 14:47.080
Women aren't allowed on submarines.

14:47.166 --> 14:51.627
They are now. Admiral Graham
instituted a trial programme.

14:51.712 --> 14:54.203
- I'm it.
- Good old Graham.

14:56.258 --> 14:58.880
Men! At ease.

14:58.969 --> 15:03.845
I'd like to introduce our newest
crew member - Lt Emily Lake.

15:03.932 --> 15:06.850
Emily is part of a pilot programme

15:06.935 --> 15:12.143
to test the feasibility of women
serving on submarines.

15:12.232 --> 15:14.391
She's going to be our diving officer.

15:14.485 --> 15:18.897
Can she do a back inward
one-and-a-half in the layout position?

15:18.989 --> 15:21.065
<i>(raucous laughter)</i>

15:22.159 --> 15:26.287
Look, gentlemen,
I know this is an unusual situation.

15:26.371 --> 15:29.787
It can't be easy for Lt Lake here
to be thrown into this jungle.

15:29.875 --> 15:33.160
And I know it will make
things hard on all of us.

15:35.589 --> 15:41.674
Let me rephrase that. It's going to
make things difficult on all of us as well.

15:41.762 --> 15:47.052
But if we just work together as a team,
I'm sure we can handle ourselves...

15:48.894 --> 15:51.467
Ping!

15:51.563 --> 15:54.517
Comport ourselves as professionals.

15:55.776 --> 15:57.852
That is all.

15:59.988 --> 16:02.526
<i>(kissing noises and wolf-whistles)</i>

16:02.616 --> 16:05.154
<i>(lascivious mumbling)</i>

16:19.924 --> 16:22.712
Come on, put some muscle into it.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.140
- Stepanak, what are you doing?
- As little as possible, sir.

16:31.978 --> 16:36.272
I'm a detriment to the entire operation.
A total morale-crusher.

16:36.357 --> 16:40.402
You know that the submarine service
is entirely volunteer.

16:40.487 --> 16:44.354
- All you have to do is quit.
- My old man won't let me.

16:44.449 --> 16:48.031
He's an admiral.
He thinks sub duty will shake me up.

16:48.119 --> 16:49.697
Ha!

16:49.787 --> 16:53.203
I'm afraid you leave me no choice
but to relocate you.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.698
- Really?
- Really.

16:55.793 --> 16:57.952
- Buckman.
- Yes, sir?

17:00.256 --> 17:03.376
Thank you, Buckman. That'll be all.

17:05.011 --> 17:07.680
1B, cold.

17:07.763 --> 17:09.839
1C...

17:12.101 --> 17:14.390
Hot.

17:15.938 --> 17:19.473
Let me guess. Our electrician.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.772
- 2B...
- Yes, sir.

17:27.575 --> 17:31.869
- Naturally you would take the light end.
- You can't handle it, sweetheart?

17:31.954 --> 17:36.201
Hey, this is the navy.
Don't call me sweetheart.

17:36.292 --> 17:40.954
- Hey, Gomer, can you get this hatch for us?
- This week.

17:46.510 --> 17:49.215
Aaargh!

17:51.015 --> 17:52.343
Uh-oh.

17:59.607 --> 18:01.895
Buckman!

18:03.068 --> 18:07.232
- What the hell are you doing?
- Stocking the pantry, sir.

18:07.323 --> 18:12.234
You forgot "like an idiot", because
you're stocking the pantry like an idiot.

18:12.786 --> 18:15.953
What are in these cans, Buckman?

18:16.040 --> 18:19.788
That one's coffee.
That one looks like cooking lard, sir.

18:19.877 --> 18:23.043
And which do you think
we're going to be using more often?

18:23.130 --> 18:25.288
The coffee or the lard?

18:27.092 --> 18:32.881
You think we're all going to jump out of bed
and have a big hot steaming cup of pig fat?

18:32.973 --> 18:35.678
Well, if it's a cold morning, sir, you might...

18:35.767 --> 18:40.513
The lard is in your head, Buckman!

18:40.606 --> 18:43.179
Now you take a look at that galley chart.

18:43.275 --> 18:47.486
Cos I want that cabinet repacked
regulation-style by 1100.

18:47.571 --> 18:51.070
- Do you know what time 1100 is?
- That would be after 1000, sir.

18:51.158 --> 18:53.565
- Marty.
- What?!

18:53.660 --> 18:55.736
Sir?

18:56.496 --> 18:59.414
Can we speak in my cabin?

19:00.542 --> 19:02.618
Carry on.

19:05.088 --> 19:11.376
Marty, I'm a little worried about your health.
Not exactly a people person, are you?

19:11.470 --> 19:16.546
I'm afraid you're headed straight for an ulcer
if you can't ease up a little bit.

19:16.641 --> 19:20.805
I'm not happy with this boat, sir.

19:21.479 --> 19:25.394
Requesting permission for a transfer.

19:25.483 --> 19:27.310
What?

19:27.402 --> 19:30.735
Commander, this boat is...

19:30.822 --> 19:33.147
It's a rustbucket. It's a shitbox!

19:33.241 --> 19:39.778
This crew is the most incompetent bunch
of retards and assholes in naval history.

19:39.873 --> 19:44.831
I know why you're here, but I don't know why
I was considered for such an assignment.

19:44.919 --> 19:48.335
Excuse me. Why am I here?

19:49.257 --> 19:52.009
You know.

19:52.677 --> 19:55.298
- Your thing.
- What thing?

19:58.057 --> 20:01.094
The weenie tattoo.

20:01.185 --> 20:03.012
Wow!

20:03.104 --> 20:09.107
Look, I hate to disappoint you, but I may
have had some other things going for me.

20:09.193 --> 20:11.482
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I believe you, sir.

20:12.113 --> 20:16.858
Now, about my transfer. This post could
jeopardise my chances for advancement.

20:16.951 --> 20:20.996
- I mean, I am this close to command, sir.
- Forget it.

20:21.080 --> 20:25.623
You think you're the only one embarrassed
to be here? That it's what I dreamed about.

20:25.710 --> 20:32.163
We're all in this together, and you and your
career are in the hands of those assholes.

20:32.258 --> 20:35.709
Including this one.
Does that answer your question?

20:35.803 --> 20:39.006
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

20:48.441 --> 20:49.899
<i>(chuckling)</i>

20:49.984 --> 20:52.060
<i>(sailor) Go, boys!</i>

20:55.197 --> 20:57.523
Jesus Christ.

21:02.246 --> 21:05.163
<i>(Buckman) You sure her clothes are in there?</i>

21:05.833 --> 21:08.668
Uh, unless this is yours.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.136
Well done, guys.

21:21.223 --> 21:26.265
She may not be the youngest girl at the ball,
but she'll turn a head or two.

21:26.353 --> 21:30.018
If she drives as well as she looks,
we may even survive.

21:30.107 --> 21:34.685
Dive test tomorrow morning 1000.
The rest of you are on leave until...

21:49.293 --> 21:51.665
Lt Lake,

21:51.753 --> 21:53.627
you're almost out of uniform.

21:54.214 --> 21:58.426
Either you're confused about your dress size
or there's been foul play.

21:58.510 --> 22:03.468
If it's a disqualifying offence
I'd like to take full and sole responsibility, sir.

22:03.557 --> 22:08.799
Gentlemen, I want to know who did this
or shore leave is cancelled tonight.

22:11.231 --> 22:14.682
Very well. Everybody back into the boat.

22:14.776 --> 22:15.690
<i>(disapproving murmurs)</i>

22:15.777 --> 22:18.778
You heard the captain. Back on the boat!

22:18.864 --> 22:20.940
<i>(mutinous muttering)</i>

22:27.789 --> 22:29.865
Lt Lake.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.503
Sorry. It won't happen again.

22:33.587 --> 22:36.706
Thank you, sir. But I can take care of myself.

22:55.316 --> 22:59.017
All right, gentlemen. Let's kick this pig!

23:00.613 --> 23:03.151
All lines clear.

23:13.334 --> 23:16.039
<i>(¶ "Anchors Away")</i>

23:46.242 --> 23:49.492
- Get the lookouts below and button her up.
- Aye, sir.

23:49.579 --> 23:53.410
- Prepare to rig for dive!
- Aye, rig for dive.

23:53.499 --> 23:56.666
Watch your drift here.
Strong crosscurrents.

23:56.752 --> 24:00.584
- I'm aware of that, sir. I've compensated.
- Excellent.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.169
So, you ever dived a boat before, Lieutenant?

24:05.636 --> 24:08.637
I mean on purpose?

24:08.722 --> 24:13.468
I've done over 300 on a simulator, sir.
75 of them were strong-current dives.

24:13.561 --> 24:18.139
- And I'm sure you scored high, but...
- Higher than you, sir.

24:18.232 --> 24:20.640
Oh. How would you know that?

24:20.734 --> 24:25.977
- I looked up your scores. I have a printout.
- I have no doubt.

24:26.073 --> 24:29.489
Still, a simulator is not a boat.

24:29.576 --> 24:33.028
Nobody talks about brave men
in their proud simulators.

24:33.122 --> 24:36.407
<i>Way to go, sir. (obsequious snicker)</i>

24:36.500 --> 24:39.750
All right, gentlemen. Let's take her down.

24:39.837 --> 24:44.297
<i>- Prepare for dive!
- (sailor) Aye! Prepare for dive.</i>

24:45.968 --> 24:48.091
<i>(klaxon)</i>

24:48.178 --> 24:49.507
Uh...

24:49.596 --> 24:52.170
Does he mean underwater?

24:55.102 --> 24:57.178
What...

25:02.776 --> 25:05.896
Dive, dive. Rig for deep submergence.

25:05.988 --> 25:09.072
- Make your depth 6-2 feet.
- 6-2, aye.

25:09.157 --> 25:11.446
Seven, down 6-2.

25:11.535 --> 25:16.244
Full ahead two-thirds.
Blow negative to the mark.

25:24.756 --> 25:27.461
OK, boys. Down we go.

25:29.052 --> 25:31.377
<i>(sinister chuckle)</i>

25:59.457 --> 26:01.533
Oh, my God.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.130
<i>- What the hell did you do?
- What the hell did you do?</i>

26:05.213 --> 26:07.538
We're dead. Five to one says we're dead.

26:07.632 --> 26:12.590
- Cool. Did we hit an iceberg?
- Off the coast of Virginia?

26:12.679 --> 26:17.424
- Sir, we have 12 degrees tilt starboard.
- Check all emergency vents open.

26:17.517 --> 26:21.135
- The board indicates all vents are open.
- I can see that.

26:21.229 --> 26:23.684
Captain, maybe we're taking on water.

26:23.773 --> 26:27.023
Mr Pascal, it must be a vent.

26:30.154 --> 26:33.488
<i>(sailor on Tannoy)
Emergency vent two-bravo appears shut.</i>

26:33.574 --> 26:36.445
<i>- Well, then open it.
- Roger.</i>

26:58.224 --> 26:59.469
What?

27:01.644 --> 27:04.894
That bump looks bad.
You'd better get to sickbay.

27:04.981 --> 27:08.314
I'd rather not, sir. I want to finish this dive.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.778
Very well. Continue the dive.

27:12.863 --> 27:16.647
Let's take her down to... oh, say 500 feet.

27:17.660 --> 27:19.736
Yes, sir.

27:22.623 --> 27:28.827
Make your depth 5-0-0 feet,
seven degree down bubble.

27:33.217 --> 27:37.380
- This is good coffee, Buckman.
- Thank you, sir.

27:38.931 --> 27:43.011
I'd better go see if any of
the other rooms are still tilted.

27:45.980 --> 27:47.853
This one's all right.

27:51.110 --> 27:56.531
- 1-0-0 feet, ma'am.
- Passing 100 feet.

28:05.249 --> 28:08.036
Now, keep an eye on the string.

28:08.126 --> 28:14.840
Cos the water pressure is going to squeeze
the hull of this boat like an empty beer can.

28:25.686 --> 28:28.770
2-8-0 feet, ma'am.

28:30.148 --> 28:33.517
Passing 280 feet, Captain.

28:33.610 --> 28:36.777
Jackson, adjust trim.

28:40.075 --> 28:42.364
No, it's OK.

28:42.452 --> 28:45.204
Passing 300 feet.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.618
<i>(metal buckling)</i>

28:48.708 --> 28:51.330
<i>(thudding)</i>

28:51.753 --> 28:55.122
Passing 350 feet, sir.

28:55.215 --> 28:57.006
<i>(thudding)</i>

29:03.306 --> 29:07.802
Bet you never saw anything like that
on one of them big nukes.

29:07.894 --> 29:13.481
We didn't have clotheslines. We had those
dryer things with the window on the front.

29:16.653 --> 29:20.104
<i>- 400 feet. No leaks.
- (metal buckling)</i>

29:20.907 --> 29:24.358
Sir, I believe this is crush depth
for this particular boat.

29:24.452 --> 29:27.821
I have to know what she can do, Lake.
You nervous?

29:28.539 --> 29:31.209
<i>- No, sir.
- (clanking)</i>

29:35.338 --> 29:37.710
<i>(Lake) Maintain seven down.</i>

29:43.846 --> 29:45.839
<i>(thudding, clanking)</i>

29:48.935 --> 29:51.426
<i>(loud thud)</i>

30:12.750 --> 30:16.000
<i>(screeching metal)</i>

30:19.757 --> 30:24.466
Bingo! 500 feet. God, I love this job.

30:25.554 --> 30:29.469
All right, that's enough for today.
Let's get the hell out of here.

30:29.558 --> 30:34.137
- Mr Pascal please, periscope depth.
- Periscope depth.

30:34.230 --> 30:39.520
Ladies and gentlemen, let me be the first
to congratulate you on a textbook dive.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.776
<i>(snores)</i>

30:50.913 --> 30:52.787
<i>Carl, you and the Orlando</i>

30:52.873 --> 30:59.587
are about to take part in a highly experimental
war game conceived by Admiral Winslow.

30:59.671 --> 31:03.800
<i>The objective is for the Orlando
to protect Charleston</i>

31:03.884 --> 31:09.175
against an unknown submarine
that'll try to invade the harbour.

31:09.264 --> 31:13.760
Now, I would love to be able to tell you more,

31:13.852 --> 31:17.352
but the conditions of the exercise prohibit it.

31:17.439 --> 31:19.764
However, I can tell you this.

31:19.858 --> 31:23.986
Given the nature of the intruder,
you won't have much trouble.

31:24.071 --> 31:26.147
We'll be more than ready, sir.

31:32.287 --> 31:35.905
¶ I'm going to feel the way I do today

31:35.999 --> 31:39.285
¶ Cos you, you nutsy chick, you broad

31:39.378 --> 31:42.746
¶ You make me feel so young. Boom!

31:42.839 --> 31:45.959
That was terrible.
I'm going to go outside for a smoke.

31:46.051 --> 31:51.674
When I get back in you'd better have the horn
section figured out. I can't work like this.

31:54.184 --> 31:58.264
It's two on and two outs.
Bonds is up again. Swung on.

31:58.355 --> 32:02.767
Foul down the right-field line.
It struck the ball girl. Knocked her cold.

32:02.859 --> 32:07.651
- Today's game is brought to you by...
- Boy's absorbed a lot of voltage.

32:07.739 --> 32:09.482
Conn-sonar.

32:09.574 --> 32:13.951
So far, sir, I'm only picking up
some faint merchant traffic.

32:14.037 --> 32:17.869
- Roger that, Sonar.
- Captain, I'm just wondering.

32:17.957 --> 32:21.457
We're in the engagement zone.
Shouldn't we be running silent?

32:21.544 --> 32:25.293
- Notjust yet.
- They'll find us in no time like this.

32:25.381 --> 32:28.881
They'll probably find us
in no time anyway, Marty.

32:28.968 --> 32:35.303
- Anything unusual up there?
- Just fishing boats. Weather's gotten bad.

32:47.236 --> 32:50.190
The intruder is probably
coming from Norfolk.

32:50.281 --> 32:54.777
Her captain will assume
we'll concentrate our efforts to the north.

32:54.869 --> 32:58.487
But her captain is undoubtedly
a cunning man,

32:58.581 --> 33:02.745
so we shall do the opposite
and deploy southerly.

33:02.835 --> 33:06.251
XO, come to 1-7-6, ahead full.

33:06.339 --> 33:10.039
Aye, sir. Course 1-7-6 ahead full.

33:10.510 --> 33:14.673
- Picking up anything, Sonar?
- Nothing much, sir.

33:14.764 --> 33:18.975
Buckman's eating an Oreo up in the galley.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.310
- Stepanak's taking a leak.
- In the ocean, I mean.

33:22.396 --> 33:23.428
Oh.

33:23.522 --> 33:26.974
No, just a couple of biologics, sir.
Would you like to listen?

33:27.068 --> 33:29.985
No, I'll pass on that, thanks.

33:30.071 --> 33:32.775
What are these tapes you got here?

33:32.865 --> 33:35.438
Those are whales, sir.

33:35.534 --> 33:41.121
I tape them, try to learn their language.
Just basic chitchat and so on.

33:41.207 --> 33:46.545
I do their hailing call against the hull.
Sometimes they actually answer back.

33:47.171 --> 33:51.999
Had a nice young couple alongside
two or three hours ago.

33:52.092 --> 33:57.253
If you hear them talking about the new
nuclear attack sub in town, let me know.

33:57.348 --> 33:59.921
Aye-aye, sir.

34:03.687 --> 34:08.929
Conn-sonar. I've got a noise level
bearing 3-4-6 that may be a contact.

34:09.025 --> 34:11.599
But it's pretty shallow to be a sub.

34:11.695 --> 34:16.606
Make normal one-third turns.
Come right at 3-4-6.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.942
Try to get a definitive classification.

34:19.036 --> 34:23.116
Secure the engines.
Periscope depth. Answer bells on batteries.

34:23.206 --> 34:27.251
- I want to hear if anybody's out there.
- Aye, sir. Kill the engines.

34:34.342 --> 34:38.175
Conn-sonar.
Captain, we've lost the contact.

34:39.681 --> 34:44.473
- Continue course and speed.
- Aye, sir. Continue course and speed.

34:44.561 --> 34:48.511
Sonar originally classified this contact
as a possible submarine.

34:48.607 --> 34:53.434
- Now they think it was a diesel engine.
- If it's a diesel contact, then it's not a sub.

34:53.527 --> 34:55.650
Aye, sir.

34:55.739 --> 34:59.606
Wait. Better check it outjust to make sure.

34:59.701 --> 35:03.568
- Bring me to single-ping range.
- That'll give away our position.

35:03.663 --> 35:07.115
Minimal risk with this contact.
Single-ping range, please.

35:10.170 --> 35:16.208
Jeez! Just been pinged big time, sir.
Bearing 0-3-0.

35:16.301 --> 35:20.630
That didn't take long. This could be
the shortest command stint in history.

35:20.722 --> 35:23.474
I knew we shouldn't have
come in from the south.

35:23.558 --> 35:27.603
Nice tactics, Captain Custer.
We should be home in a couple of hours.

35:27.687 --> 35:32.230
<i>It's the Orlando, sir. No question.
I know her machinery signature.</i>

35:32.317 --> 35:37.358
Judging by that ping,
she's about 12,000 yards off and closing.

35:37.447 --> 35:40.282
<i>The Orlando. Carl Knox.</i>

35:40.366 --> 35:44.067
- We still might have time to go deep and run.
- I doubt it.

35:44.162 --> 35:48.575
- Lake, prepare to surface.
- Surface? What for?

35:49.459 --> 35:51.617
I mean aye, sir.

35:51.711 --> 35:56.337
Sir, respectfully, I can't concur with
your decision to surrender this quickly.

35:56.424 --> 35:59.674
I'm proud of you.
Once we're on top, run on one screw only.

35:59.761 --> 36:05.003
Rig for red. And, Howard, send somebody
forward with a drop light and duck tape.

36:05.099 --> 36:08.302
<i>(Howard) What is this, a scavenger hunt?</i>

36:08.394 --> 36:12.641
Mr Jackson, you look like
you could use some fresh air.

36:12.732 --> 36:14.440
Uh, no.

36:16.068 --> 36:20.944
Conn-sonar. We have
the contact steady at 5,000 yards.

36:21.032 --> 36:26.655
- Come to periscope depth.
- Make your depth 6-4 feet, ahead two-thirds.

36:32.585 --> 36:37.294
RJ, I want you to climb the periscope
and put that lamp up on top of it.

36:37.381 --> 36:39.872
- All the way up there, sir?
- Yes.

36:39.967 --> 36:45.803
Look, I need an athlete and
you're the only one I got, so get going.

36:55.483 --> 36:57.605
Oh, shit. Agh!

36:57.693 --> 37:03.399
Hang on, RJ. You're not getting out of it
that easy. Now get your butt up there.

37:05.367 --> 37:08.321
I never saw this shit
on the recruiting poster.

37:08.412 --> 37:13.407
- All right. Lash the lamp to the scope.
- OK, OK.

37:14.752 --> 37:16.828
Passing 9-0 feet.

37:20.090 --> 37:21.964
Got it, sir.

37:22.051 --> 37:24.292
¶ Be all that you can be

37:24.386 --> 37:26.509
That's the army song, Jackson.

37:26.597 --> 37:29.135
Raise the periscope!

37:35.063 --> 37:37.554
Sonar, plug that in.
Running lights on.

37:37.649 --> 37:39.891
- Running lights?
- Turn 'em on!

37:39.985 --> 37:42.393
We are not running silent. Listen up.

37:56.251 --> 37:58.409
Oh, my Lord, what is that?

38:00.088 --> 38:03.706
Looks like nothing but a fishing trawler.

38:05.385 --> 38:08.172
<i>(all sing "Louie, Louie")</i>

38:14.060 --> 38:17.061
<i>(faint strains of "Louie, Louie")</i>

38:29.159 --> 38:31.235
Captain.

38:31.661 --> 38:34.199
Listen to this.

38:34.289 --> 38:37.373
<i>("Louie, Louie" continues)</i>

38:46.217 --> 38:51.722
Perfect. We just chased down
a boatload of beered-up fishermen.

38:52.849 --> 38:57.262
Come to north at full speed.
Set your depth at 200 feet.

38:57.353 --> 38:59.429
<i>(¶ "Louie, Louie")</i>

39:01.566 --> 39:07.106
Contact is breaking off, sir.
Leaving the area fast and noisy.

39:07.196 --> 39:09.984
I... I think we did it, sir.

39:14.454 --> 39:16.695
<i>- Pay up.
- (Dodge) Well done.</i>

39:16.789 --> 39:21.202
Mr Pascal, let's go to Charleston harbour
and blow something up.

39:21.294 --> 39:23.500
Now we're talking.

39:23.588 --> 39:27.253
Are we really going to
blow something up, sir?

39:27.341 --> 39:30.545
No, no, Sonar. We'll just use flares.

39:33.723 --> 39:38.219
Well, the storm's passed.
Not a word on Dodge.

39:38.311 --> 39:41.680
Appears he doesn't want to
come near the engagement area.

39:41.772 --> 39:46.849
Too bad for me. That's why you invited me to
Charleston, to gloat that he didn't show up?

39:46.944 --> 39:51.487
No, sir. Not at all.
Dodge was simply outclassed.

39:51.574 --> 39:55.951
I've never lost a war game,
and I'm not about to start right now.

39:56.036 --> 40:00.745
- I'm in line for a third star.
- Oh, my God. I'll no longer outrank you.

40:00.833 --> 40:05.162
<i>- What a horrifying thought.
- (hissing)</i>

40:05.838 --> 40:10.583
- Oh, boy, look at the fireworks.
- No, I believe that's a flare.

40:13.012 --> 40:15.633
Oh, no. It can't be!

40:16.515 --> 40:18.887
<i>(laughs)</i>

40:22.479 --> 40:25.267
<i>(Winslow) Chalk one up for the diesel navy!</i>

40:25.357 --> 40:28.857
He got Charleston. One down, one to go.

40:28.944 --> 40:30.937
- Yeah!
- Damn it to hell.

40:31.030 --> 40:37.068
War game record's starting to look shaky,
not to mention that third star.

40:37.161 --> 40:42.747
I don't know how he pulled this stunt off,
but I guarantee you one thing, sir.

40:42.833 --> 40:46.665
There will not be a repeat
of this embarrassment

40:46.753 --> 40:51.415
because I will have his tattooed hide
nailed to my office door.

40:59.408 --> 41:01.981
- What is this doing here?
- This?

41:02.077 --> 41:05.825
It's to remind me what I'll be driving
next year instead of this.

41:05.914 --> 41:08.286
How do you figure that?

41:08.375 --> 41:10.367
I got four months to go in the navy.

41:10.460 --> 41:14.125
I'll play in the CBA until some
NBA team need a point guard.

41:14.214 --> 41:18.081
- Then I pick up my ride.
- Another loser fantasy.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.960
Loser? At least I can say
I played in front of 19,000 people.

41:22.055 --> 41:24.593
What the hell have you ever done?

41:24.683 --> 41:29.012
More than you know, including
being chauffeured around in your dream car.

41:29.104 --> 41:32.520
The only you ever been chauffeured
around in is a paddy wagon.

41:32.607 --> 41:35.229
- 50 bucks.
- It's a bet.

41:35.318 --> 41:38.105
Big Jimmy, a guy I owed money to, had one.

41:38.196 --> 41:42.408
His boys threw me in the trunk
and they dumped me naked in the country.

41:42.492 --> 41:46.572
Nice car. Even the trunk
had cut-pile carpeting.

41:46.663 --> 41:50.447
Gimme the money. Pay it up.
50 bucks. Ulysses S Grant.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.036
<i>(sneezes)</i>

41:52.127 --> 41:55.377
- That is so nasty.
- I'm sorry. A little dusty in here.

41:59.008 --> 42:02.294
- Admiral Graham on the radio for you, sir.
- Thank you.

42:02.387 --> 42:06.087
- Patching you through.
- Radio's working like a Swiss...

42:06.182 --> 42:07.380
car.

42:07.475 --> 42:09.551
Dodge here.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.138
"Stairway To Heaven."

42:14.107 --> 42:16.598
Led Zeppelin, 1971, right?

42:16.693 --> 42:23.146
OK! Good news, guys. We've just won the
Billy Joel tickets and the WROK T-shirts.

42:23.241 --> 42:26.195
Nitro, do you want to get me
Admiral Graham now?

42:26.285 --> 42:28.361
OK.

42:40.299 --> 42:42.422
<i>It's a little tickle. (laughs)</i>

42:42.510 --> 42:45.001
Go ahead, sir. Try it now.

42:45.096 --> 42:48.928
Hello, Admiral Graham.
Called to congratulate me?

42:50.226 --> 42:54.354
I'd say the weather was
the determining factor, wouldn't you?

42:55.189 --> 42:57.762
<i>- All part of my strategy, sir.
- Uh-huh.</i>

42:57.858 --> 43:03.944
Look, Dodge, for the rest of this exercise,
there's been a reconfiguration.

43:04.031 --> 43:05.229
Shoot.

43:05.324 --> 43:11.030
<i>Your new orders are to operate
only in sections 3A and 3B.</i>

43:11.122 --> 43:16.792
And, as usual, you will surrender
upon confirmation of a shooting solution.

43:16.877 --> 43:20.293
But that cuts the containment area in half, sir.

43:20.381 --> 43:25.967
- Does Admiral Winslow know about this?
- He is not administering this war game.

43:26.428 --> 43:30.011
You have your orders, Captain.
Do you read me?

43:30.099 --> 43:32.934
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

43:33.018 --> 43:37.098
And, Dodge, remember... just a game.

43:44.029 --> 43:45.856
Buckman!

43:45.948 --> 43:49.992
There was a fingernail in my food,
you fat-ass moron.

43:50.077 --> 43:52.698
Yesterday, it was a Band-Aid!

43:52.788 --> 43:56.073
Sorry, sir. The Band-Aid
was holding the fingernail on.

43:56.166 --> 44:01.540
- What else do you put in your sauces?
- It's an old family recipe, sir. It's a secret.

44:01.630 --> 44:05.497
Oh, my God. There's cockroaches in the flour.

44:05.592 --> 44:08.083
Your cigar ash is in the spaghetti.

44:10.806 --> 44:15.017
<i>Jesus, Buckman. This stuff's been
on the Stingray since Korea.</i>

44:15.102 --> 44:17.260
This can expired in 1966.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.056
It still tastes like creamed corn.

44:21.149 --> 44:24.518
- Except it's devilled ham!
- That would be a problem.

44:24.611 --> 44:27.814
The captain's gonna hear about this.

44:38.708 --> 44:41.246
Nobody saw that.

44:42.212 --> 44:47.253
You should more careful, sir. Remember,
when you rush, that's when accidents happen.

44:47.342 --> 44:49.418
Shut up, Buckman!

45:03.566 --> 45:05.642
Uh-oh.

45:09.489 --> 45:13.736
Excuse me, sir,
but I'm picking up all kinds of stuff.

45:17.664 --> 45:19.740
Up periscope.

45:22.877 --> 45:25.368
Oh, my God. Three destroyers and a frigate.

45:25.463 --> 45:29.792
Active pinging, sir. From aircraft sonar buoys.

45:32.929 --> 45:35.550
Down periscope. Emergency deep.

45:35.640 --> 45:40.598
<i>- Rig for silent running. Battle stations.
- (Lake) All ahead full.</i>

45:40.686 --> 45:43.972
All planes on full dive.

45:44.065 --> 45:46.472
Full negative to the mark.

45:46.567 --> 45:48.560
- Passing 100.
- What's going on?

45:48.653 --> 45:53.196
- Any way I can cause a problem?
- No, we're pretty well covered for now.

45:53.282 --> 45:55.952
- Shit.
- Passing 120.

45:56.035 --> 45:59.071
Let the air out.
We got to get below that P3 sonar.

45:59.163 --> 46:03.659
- 20 degrees down bubble.
- Take her all the way down to the bottom.

46:03.751 --> 46:05.993
- To the bottom?
- Confuses their sonar.

46:06.087 --> 46:10.036
They can't distinguish between us
and the ocean floor.

46:20.726 --> 46:24.309
- Passing 300 feet.
- Approaching the bottom, sir.

46:24.396 --> 46:27.516
I can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out.

46:27.608 --> 46:32.566
Two degrees down bubble.
No, one-and-a-half degrees down bubble.

46:32.655 --> 46:34.647
- Everything in hand?
- Yes, sir.

46:34.740 --> 46:39.069
- Didn't do much bottoming on the simulator.
- Nothing to it. Piece of cake.

46:39.161 --> 46:41.237
One degree down bubble.

46:41.330 --> 46:43.287
No. Yes.

46:47.044 --> 46:50.294
Approximately ten feet to bottom, sir.

46:50.381 --> 46:53.050
All stop. Half-degree down bubble.

47:02.392 --> 47:04.765
Conn-sonar. Hot noise in the water.

47:06.688 --> 47:08.681
<i>(clanking)</i>

47:12.569 --> 47:16.152
- What did it sound like?
- It was loud, sir. Two heavy bangs.

47:18.992 --> 47:22.112
Nice job, Lake. Like dropping a piano.

47:22.204 --> 47:25.240
Why don't you do it again
in case they didn't hear you?

47:25.332 --> 47:30.955
It's all right. Everybody back to stations.
Begin damage check.

47:31.046 --> 47:35.922
All hands, we are now going silent.
Repeat, full silent.

47:42.933 --> 47:47.096
P3's reported possible submarine.
Approximately 9,000 yards.

47:47.187 --> 47:49.263
Shall I go active?

47:49.356 --> 47:52.559
Passive sonar only.
Let's not give away our position.

48:07.374 --> 48:10.493
Chin up, Lake, it wasn't your fault.

48:44.577 --> 48:48.575
This is the approximate area
of the last sonar buoy contact, sir.

48:48.664 --> 48:51.416
Don't hear anything,
but they may be playing possum.

48:55.087 --> 48:58.291
Gimme a pack of gum. The Fruit Stripe.

49:00.593 --> 49:03.713
That's 25. Chew it silently.

49:09.727 --> 49:12.847
<i>(whispers) Sir. It's the Orlando.</i>

49:13.522 --> 49:16.358
Somebody just dropped 45 cents.

49:17.276 --> 49:21.689
- You're sure?
- Oh, yeah. A quarter and two dimes.

49:53.395 --> 49:55.471
<i>(farts)</i>

50:02.362 --> 50:04.936
Hear something?

50:05.032 --> 50:10.322
Yeah. Almost sounded like... an explosion.

50:38.231 --> 50:40.271
Oh, man!

50:53.538 --> 50:57.203
- Anything else?
- Not yet.

51:12.390 --> 51:14.928
Somebody needs to sew his ass shut.

52:40.019 --> 52:42.177
<i>(whale-like squealing)</i>

52:49.945 --> 52:52.021
<i>(whale noises)</i>

52:53.449 --> 52:55.525
Is it a biologic?

52:56.493 --> 52:59.329
Sounds like a whale.

52:59.413 --> 53:01.489
<i>(whale noises)</i>

53:04.877 --> 53:07.712
It must be a whale. It's moving around.

53:07.796 --> 53:09.872
<i>(clicking)</i>

53:13.552 --> 53:15.379
<i>(squeals)</i>

53:17.681 --> 53:19.970
Now it sounds like there's two of 'em.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.315
<i>(noises continue)</i>

53:38.410 --> 53:41.115
Ahh, the heck with it. False alarm.

53:41.204 --> 53:43.992
Back to periscope depth. Ahead full.

54:03.768 --> 54:05.311
<i>(squeaks) Orl...</i>

54:05.395 --> 54:09.309
<i>Orlando, sir. 300 yards and opening.</i>

54:10.442 --> 54:14.356
OK. Somebody find Buckman,
launch him out of a torpedo tube.

54:14.446 --> 54:18.526
XO, let's get this boat moving,
course 0-2-7, and vent this smoke.

54:18.617 --> 54:21.190
- Sir, that's out of the quadrant.
- Yes, it is.

54:21.286 --> 54:26.161
I must protest. We have orders from Admiral
Graham to stay in this containment area.

54:26.249 --> 54:32.038
I know my orders, XO. Course 0-2-7.
When we're clear, surface and run all full.

54:32.130 --> 54:35.581
Stepanak. You missed an opportunity there.

54:35.675 --> 54:39.507
One noise from you,
we could have been in a world of trouble.

54:39.596 --> 54:44.008
That would have been unethical, sir.
I'm only out to screw myself.

54:44.100 --> 54:47.220
That would have screwed everybody.

55:10.877 --> 55:13.000
Live to fight another day, Captain Poon.

55:40.948 --> 55:43.024
<i>(knocks)</i>

55:45.244 --> 55:47.817
Permission to enter, Lt Lake.

55:55.754 --> 55:59.538
- Lt Lake?
- I didn't give you permission to enter.

55:59.633 --> 56:03.797
Well, sometimes a captain
must take unilateral action.

56:04.930 --> 56:09.224
- I could have you put on report.
- Pfft! Be my guest.

56:10.394 --> 56:17.108
Look, Lake. There is no way you could know
what the contour of the ocean floor was like.

56:17.192 --> 56:21.237
- It was as much my fault as anybody's.
- No. It was mine.

56:22.072 --> 56:28.110
I don't have the necessary training
to continue to be the dive officer on this boat.

56:28.203 --> 56:30.955
Especially given your high-risk manoeuvres.

56:31.039 --> 56:37.920
Let me be the judge of that. No one could
have set us down in any better condition.

56:38.005 --> 56:45.135
Sir, I not only gave away our position,
I potentially endangered the crew.

56:45.762 --> 56:50.056
Would you be this easy on me
if I was a properly experienced sailor?

56:50.976 --> 56:53.893
I'd like to think so.

56:57.858 --> 57:00.313
Thank you, Captain.

57:01.611 --> 57:03.687
Good night.

57:04.322 --> 57:06.398
Good night.

57:08.577 --> 57:10.865
Sir...

57:12.038 --> 57:14.956
The Murmansk brushing incident.

57:16.167 --> 57:18.623
How did you get over that?

57:20.589 --> 57:22.795
Got drunk and passed out.

57:22.882 --> 57:27.094
Woke up the next morning
with a hangover and a tattoo.

57:27.178 --> 57:30.096
I wouldn't recommend the tattoo.

57:35.770 --> 57:38.973
- Polishing the old torpedo, sir?
- Shut up, Stepanak.

57:39.065 --> 57:42.730
- Thank you, sir. It's nice to be noticed.
- Oh, get out.

57:42.819 --> 57:45.986
Come on. Get back to bed!

58:00.837 --> 58:03.957
May I have a word with you in private, sir?

58:04.048 --> 58:06.124
Sure.

58:11.806 --> 58:14.214
Sir...

58:14.308 --> 58:20.062
Your decision to leave the engagement zone
is a direct violation of our standing orders.

58:20.148 --> 58:22.224
I'm aware of that, XO.

58:22.316 --> 58:25.851
And now we appear to have
broken off radio contact.

58:25.945 --> 58:29.112
You are right on top of things as usual, Marty.

58:29.198 --> 58:32.863
Captain, we are not following
the parameters of this exercise.

58:32.952 --> 58:35.028
I have been individually briefed.

58:35.121 --> 58:40.363
I believe we are following
the spirit of this exercise, its intent.

58:40.459 --> 58:43.911
And I believe that you are deluded.

58:45.339 --> 58:48.091
You've hijacked your own boat.

58:48.175 --> 58:54.677
I think it's my duty to inform the crew that
we are operating outside of the navy's control

58:54.765 --> 58:58.549
and ask you to relinquish command.

58:59.603 --> 59:02.308
- Relinquish command.
- Yes, sir.

59:03.149 --> 59:05.225
To who?

59:06.861 --> 59:08.937
To me.

59:11.323 --> 59:13.399
Excuse me.

59:14.201 --> 59:16.490
Captain! Sir.

59:17.162 --> 59:21.492
Sir? I checked the manual
and I am well within my rights.

59:21.583 --> 59:24.039
All hands, this is the captain speaking.

59:24.128 --> 59:28.208
Executive Officer Martin Pascal
has something he'd like to say to you.

59:32.094 --> 59:33.422
<i>(clears throat)</i>

59:33.512 --> 59:35.588
Men...

59:36.723 --> 59:38.383
XO Pascal here.

59:38.475 --> 59:43.303
I feel it is my duty to inform you

59:43.397 --> 59:46.896
that we are no longer
in contact with COMSUBLANT.

59:46.984 --> 59:50.269
And we have left the containment area,

59:50.362 --> 59:55.190
in direct violation of orders
from Admiral Graham.

59:55.284 --> 59:58.238
The captain does not deny this.

59:59.830 --> 01:00:04.788
So I need, I would like, your support

01:00:04.876 --> 01:00:11.211
<i>in asking that the captain hand over
command of the Stingray</i>

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:15.215
to me.

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:21.599
Marty Pascal. God bless you all.

01:00:29.818 --> 01:00:32.060
This is Captain Tom Dodge.

01:00:32.153 --> 01:00:38.690
No one has ever been court-martialled
for following the captain's orders.

01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:42.735
However, if any of you would like
to support Pascal, you may speak up now

01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:47.540
without fear of punishment
or reprisal from me.

01:01:00.473 --> 01:01:05.680
Well, Mr Pascal, looks like
you're guilty of attempted mutiny.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:09.435
That's absurd. These men love me!

01:01:11.526 --> 01:01:15.358
Mr Stepanak, would you
come to the control room, please?

01:01:15.446 --> 01:01:18.898
¶ Come all ye young fellows
who follow the sea

01:01:18.992 --> 01:01:21.862
¶ Yo-ho and blow the man down

01:01:21.953 --> 01:01:25.238
¶ It's time to be bathing Lieutenant Marty

01:01:25.331 --> 01:01:28.285
¶ Yo-ho and blow the man down

01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:31.412
¶ Oh, give me a plank
that looks down on the sea

01:01:31.504 --> 01:01:34.209
¶ Yo-ho and blow the man down

01:01:34.298 --> 01:01:37.798
¶ It's a short little walk bound for eternity

01:01:37.885 --> 01:01:42.796
¶ Yo-ho and blow the man down

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:46.259
¶ Blow that nutso kooky punk back downtown

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:50.136
Captain Blood, bring forth the prisoner.

01:01:50.231 --> 01:01:54.893
- Hey, Nitro. Ain't that one of my chickens?
- No, it's a parrot.

01:01:54.986 --> 01:01:58.817
- From the Caribbean.
- Don't let it fly away. That's supper.

01:01:58.906 --> 01:02:00.317
Aar.

01:02:00.408 --> 01:02:03.112
<i>(pirate-like cries of "Aar!")</i>

01:02:08.499 --> 01:02:13.955
<i>(pirate accent) Mr Pascal. Have you any
last words before you walk the plank, sir?</i>

01:02:14.046 --> 01:02:18.293
You can't do this, you maniac.
This is the modern navy!

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:20.460
People don't walk the plank.

01:02:20.553 --> 01:02:24.218
Cap'n Blood, consign him to the briny deep!

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:25.682
<i>(cheering)</i>

01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:29.550
Sonar, play me a dirge, matey.

01:02:31.855 --> 01:02:33.729
<i>(¶ "Funeral March")</i>

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.058
<i>(crew hums along)</i>

01:02:48.747 --> 01:02:53.374
Luck be with ye, Mr Pascal. Walk!

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.039
This is crazy! This can't be happening.

01:02:58.131 --> 01:03:01.465
You've lost it, Dodge.
You've gone round the bend.

01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:05.419
You'll hang for this. Stop or you'll all hang.

01:03:05.514 --> 01:03:10.639
Eternal ocean from which we came,
receive Lt Martin Pascal.

01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:16.184
May God have mercy on his soul.

01:03:16.274 --> 01:03:20.402
Now you're mine, maggot.
Watch that last step.

01:03:20.987 --> 01:03:23.146
Mommy!

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.528
<i>(whooping)</i>

01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:28.953
The US Navy thanks you
for your help, gentlemen.

01:03:29.037 --> 01:03:31.030
Any time.

01:03:31.957 --> 01:03:33.996
You bastard, Dodge!

01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:35.324
Oh!

01:03:39.339 --> 01:03:42.755
That wasn't so bad, was it, Lieutenant?

01:03:43.468 --> 01:03:48.296
All right. All hands below.
We're going back inside the containment area.

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:50.466
<i>(cheering)</i>

01:03:57.565 --> 01:04:02.690
- He made him walk the plank?!
- Sir, this exercise has gotten out of hand.

01:04:02.779 --> 01:04:06.907
Not only has he violated
the rules of this war game,

01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:10.859
but he's gone AWOL
with US government property.

01:04:10.954 --> 01:04:14.453
- The man should be court-martialled.
- But you can't find him.

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:22.453
I don't have to. Dodge wouldn't have pushed
it unless he planned to make a run on Norfolk.

01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:25.917
<i>- I'll be waiting for him.
- You'll be waiting for him?</i>

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:32.808
Yes, sir. I plan on taking charge
of his capture. Personally.

01:05:22.399 --> 01:05:28.153
Yeah, there are about 15 ships out there.
They got 'em set up like a picket line.

01:05:28.239 --> 01:05:30.730
They must know we're coming.

01:05:31.408 --> 01:05:34.078
Down periscope.

01:05:35.704 --> 01:05:39.369
- Attention on deck.
- It's all right, men. Carry on.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.664
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:05:41.752 --> 01:05:45.832
Just what the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:05:45.923 --> 01:05:49.873
I haven't been getting much sleep.
Everything's set to go, right?

01:05:49.968 --> 01:05:53.551
- Yes, sir. The harbour is blockaded.
- Good.

01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:56.640
Have all surface ships
begin their sonar search.

01:05:56.725 --> 01:05:59.097
Aye-aye, sir. Submerge the boat.

01:05:59.186 --> 01:06:03.729
Now, gentlemen, now! Let's go.
Like it already happened.

01:06:03.816 --> 01:06:06.389
Active sonars in all quadrants, sir.

01:06:06.485 --> 01:06:10.529
Air, ship, ocean floor sensors.
They got everything on.

01:06:10.614 --> 01:06:11.859
Aar!

01:06:11.949 --> 01:06:17.738
No surprise. From here on out,
no unnecessary conversation.

01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:24.033
We have a faint echo, Captain.
15,000 yards at three-four-niner.

01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:25.586
Track steady.

01:06:33.053 --> 01:06:38.593
We're being actively pinged, sir.
Repeat, active sonar, 12,000 yards.

01:06:38.683 --> 01:06:43.678
Steady on course.
Keep an ear out for commercial traffic.

01:06:45.023 --> 01:06:47.063
11,000 yards and closing.

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:51.611
- OK, let's prepare torpedo guidance.
- Aye, sir. Prepare torpedo guidance.

01:06:52.239 --> 01:06:54.315
<i>(klaxon)</i>

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:06.115
What's the surface traffic like?

01:07:06.211 --> 01:07:13.293
Five destroyers, three frigates
and a commercial supertanker, sir.

01:07:13.384 --> 01:07:16.136
<i>The Denali, out of Philadelphia.</i>

01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:21.891
Ladies and gentlemen, we have fulfilled
every requirement of this mission except one.

01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:23.601
Norfolk.

01:07:23.686 --> 01:07:29.772
Presently there are several ships positioned
outside the harbour to intercept us.

01:07:29.859 --> 01:07:38.282
To get in, we're going to have to use a tactic
that is somewhat bizarre and extremely risky.

01:07:38.368 --> 01:07:42.033
If any of you feel it's not worth it,
please let me know now.

01:07:42.121 --> 01:07:46.783
Sir, I think we'd prefer to go with
the bizarre and risky. It worked for us so far.

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:51.170
- I think we should continue to kick ass, sir.
- Yeah!

01:07:55.426 --> 01:07:57.715
Very well, then.

01:07:57.804 --> 01:08:00.176
Make for the tanker. All ahead full.

01:08:00.264 --> 01:08:04.096
- The tanker, sir?
- We're going to use it as a hat.

01:08:04.185 --> 01:08:08.135
- How do we get in?
- Right between the screws.

01:08:10.816 --> 01:08:15.395
- Why notjust come up from underneath?
- You got to go through the cavitation.

01:08:15.488 --> 01:08:19.354
They lose us for 20, 30 seconds,
then all they can pick up is the tanker.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:24.741
- I've never done a manoeuvre like that, sir.
- You have. Pinpoint drills on the simulator.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:30.536
- Captain, this is way over my head.
- Just focus on your procedures.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:34.625
You've all worked so hard,
I don't want to be the one who screws it up.

01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:39.756
- Emily...
- Please. Don't ask me.

01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:47.599
- OK, I'll take it, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, Captain.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.140
- Make your depth 1-2-5 feet.
- 1-2-5, aye.

01:08:57.696 --> 01:09:01.943
8,000 yards and closing, sir.
Confirm torpedo range.

01:09:02.033 --> 01:09:07.490
- Fix position. Prepare for guidance lock.
- I got you now, Popeye.

01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:22.924
100 yards and closing, sir.
Two minutes to contact.

01:09:23.013 --> 01:09:26.345
- Three degrees down bubble.
- Three degrees, aye.

01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:28.473
Three degrees? Sir?

01:09:29.728 --> 01:09:33.678
- What is it, Lake?
- Nothing, sir.

01:09:40.154 --> 01:09:44.616
- Propeller turbulence is becoming a problem.
- Two degrees down bubble.

01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:48.746
- Make that two-and-half degrees.
- Two-and-a-half degrees, aye.

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:54.454
- Maybe one-and-a-half, sir.
- Be quiet, Lake, or do it yourself.

01:09:59.424 --> 01:10:03.671
It's getting tough to hold on in this wash.
I must be right behind a prop.

01:10:03.762 --> 01:10:06.881
- One degree left rudder.
- No, sir!

01:10:06.973 --> 01:10:09.464
Chop's heavier to port. We need right rudder.

01:10:09.559 --> 01:10:13.806
- You know better, get up here and drive.
- I don't think I should, sir.

01:10:13.897 --> 01:10:18.689
You're the only one who can, Lake.
I'm guessing here.

01:10:32.207 --> 01:10:36.335
- All back one-third. Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder, aye.

01:10:41.424 --> 01:10:43.500
Ten feet and closing, sir.

01:10:43.593 --> 01:10:46.878
All ahead two-thirds. Rudder amidships.

01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:50.921
Zero bubble. Steady course 2-7-0.

01:10:51.017 --> 01:10:53.093
Balls to the wall, boys!

01:11:01.194 --> 01:11:04.610
- Stay right full. Hold steady now.
- We're holding, ma'am.

01:11:04.697 --> 01:11:07.235
- Hang with me, Jackson.
- Tight on it.

01:11:14.457 --> 01:11:19.368
Sir, sonar contact is breaking up.
We're having some trouble tracking them.

01:11:19.462 --> 01:11:21.668
What?

01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:24.543
Don't you dare tell me that.

01:11:39.231 --> 01:11:42.066
Conn-engine room. We're taking on water!

01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:44.309
I'll take care of it, sir.

01:11:45.863 --> 01:11:49.030
Maintain course.
Help is on the way.

01:11:57.416 --> 01:11:59.456
<i>(Stepanak) Hey, Fowler!</i>

01:11:59.543 --> 01:12:03.375
The leaks are too strong.
We've got to abandon.

01:12:03.464 --> 01:12:05.540
You're not abandoning shit!

01:12:05.632 --> 01:12:10.591
I hate these stinking submarines,
but I sure as hell am not going to die in one.

01:12:10.679 --> 01:12:12.921
Plug those leaks!

01:12:19.563 --> 01:12:21.971
- Bump it up to full.
- Keep your trim.

01:12:22.065 --> 01:12:25.434
One-and-a-half down bubble.
All ahead full.

01:12:35.829 --> 01:12:38.154
Come on, guys, let's work on this one.

01:12:38.248 --> 01:12:40.324
Oh, shit, it's the main.

01:12:43.879 --> 01:12:47.413
Dress rehearsal for hell, boys!

01:12:47.507 --> 01:12:49.583
<i>(long yell)</i>

01:13:04.274 --> 01:13:07.310
- You all right, Howard?
- Yeah. Did I miss anything?

01:13:07.402 --> 01:13:09.062
Just a little water.

01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:14.858
<i>(clanking)</i>

01:13:19.914 --> 01:13:21.788
<i>(clanking subsides)</i>

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:23.832
- We're through.
- Yeah!

01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:28.912
How about some quesadillas?

01:13:31.676 --> 01:13:34.048
- Nice work, Lake.
- Thank you, sir.

01:13:34.137 --> 01:13:36.295
Spots, Jackson, you too.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:43.596
- How you doing back there, Howard?
- We'll be up in a couple of minutes.

01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:47.353
- I just got out of the shower.
- Glad to hear it. Hang in there.

01:13:49.986 --> 01:13:52.062
Now, that was fun.

01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:08.911
I'm sorry, sir, but we've lost her.
Nothing out there but commercial traffic.

01:14:09.005 --> 01:14:13.216
I just don't believe it.
I can't goddamn believe it!

01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:17.464
The man's got to be out there somewhere.
He can'tjust have vanished.

01:14:26.856 --> 01:14:27.970
<i>(knocking)</i>

01:14:28.065 --> 01:14:30.141
Come in.

01:14:31.485 --> 01:14:33.443
Excuse me, Captain.

01:14:33.529 --> 01:14:36.316
All right, Lieutenant. Yes?

01:14:37.116 --> 01:14:41.493
I was wondering how much longer
you would have waited before doing it right.

01:14:41.579 --> 01:14:44.663
<i>Half a heartbeat. (laughs)</i>

01:14:44.749 --> 01:14:47.204
You scared the hell out of me, Emily.

01:14:48.043 --> 01:14:51.163
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Granted.

01:14:55.468 --> 01:14:57.590
Sir.

01:15:11.275 --> 01:15:14.062
- Hey, Spots.
- Yes, Mr Jackson.

01:15:14.153 --> 01:15:16.644
You know that lay-up
at the end of the army game?

01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:19.111
I know. You were fouled.

01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:22.568
I choked. I just wanted you to know that.

01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:25.532
What are you talking about?
You were tomahawked.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:29.572
I'm a mediocre player.
I never started for any team I ever played for.

01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:35.422
Don't give me that. You are NBA material.
You remember that.

01:15:35.507 --> 01:15:38.259
Yeah. I guess you're right.

01:15:38.927 --> 01:15:41.632
What, are you kidding?

01:15:52.941 --> 01:15:56.144
He's not in the area.
He must have headed back out to sea.

01:15:56.236 --> 01:15:59.985
Oh, no. Not him. Not now.

01:16:00.073 --> 01:16:04.285
Trust me. He is out there.

01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:13.785
Uh-oh. Tanker's turning.

01:16:13.879 --> 01:16:16.452
- What?
- It's not going to Norfolk, sir.

01:16:16.548 --> 01:16:19.300
- We're going to be uncovered real soon.
- Damn.

01:16:19.384 --> 01:16:22.302
- You want me to stay with them, sir?
- No.

01:16:22.387 --> 01:16:25.803
<i>We got a lead on the Orlando
and we passed the surface ships.</i>

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:30.683
- We got to make our run on Norfolk now.
- There's a lot of active sonar out there, sir.

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:35.646
<i>- Orlando is on definitive search and destroy.
- At least we'll know where she is.</i>

01:16:44.659 --> 01:16:47.613
Got him. 2-5-0, 12,000 yards.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:50.621
Christ, he's already ahead of us.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.201
The admiral has the conn.

01:16:55.295 --> 01:17:00.537
- Admiral, all due respect, this is my boat.
- Not right now it's not. With all due respect.

01:17:00.633 --> 01:17:05.425
Ahead full. Course 2-5-0.

01:17:13.813 --> 01:17:18.475
They're on us, sir. We're being
actively pinged, 11,000 yards and closing.

01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:20.145
Aar!

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:22.312
Up periscope.

01:17:24.824 --> 01:17:28.074
OK, we've got cloud cover up there.
Low overcast.

01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:32.075
Their planes'll have trouble seeing us.
Surface. We'll run on top.

01:17:32.165 --> 01:17:37.621
All right, everybody, it's time to kick this pig.
Leave Graham squealin' from the feelin'.

01:17:37.712 --> 01:17:41.661
- Squeakin' from the freakin'.
- Oinkin' from the boinkin'.

01:17:58.691 --> 01:18:02.190
- 10,000 yards and closing.
- Prepare for torpedo guidance.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:04.982
Let's get a shooting solution.

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.920
8,000 yards and closing, sir.

01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:29.172
Radio call for you, cap'n.
Some guy named Gramanhamham.

01:18:29.263 --> 01:18:33.557
- Put it on the overhead.
- Uh, just a minute, sir.

01:18:49.533 --> 01:18:50.612
Aar!

01:18:50.701 --> 01:18:52.859
Go ahead, sir.

01:18:52.953 --> 01:18:57.662
- Dodge here.
- Dodge, this is Admiral Graham.

01:18:57.749 --> 01:19:02.625
<i>I'm on the Orlando.
And I'm putting you on notice.</i>

01:19:02.713 --> 01:19:06.212
When informed of a shooting solution,

01:19:06.299 --> 01:19:10.843
I expect you to acknowledge it
in accordance with the rules of this war game.

01:19:10.929 --> 01:19:16.386
- Since when were rules important to you, sir?
- You watch yourself, Dodge.

01:19:16.476 --> 01:19:21.981
- You are addressing a superior officer.
- No, merely a higher-ranking one.

01:19:22.065 --> 01:19:24.141
Catch us if you can.

01:19:27.737 --> 01:19:30.608
- Gimme all you got, Howard.
- Aye, sir.

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:34.447
This is what I live for! DBF.

01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:48.128
- What are you doing?
- Whisky thins down the mix.

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:51.217
Gives us another 50rpms.

01:20:01.354 --> 01:20:03.512
5,000 yards and closing.

01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:09.224
We have guidance lock.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.448
Report when you have a shooting solution.
Put on some speed.

01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:27.586
<i>Orlando 3,000 yards and closing.</i>

01:20:27.672 --> 01:20:31.716
Conn-torpedo.
Request permission to arm flare, sir.

01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:35.929
<i>- Hell, no. Ready torpedo tubes one and two.
- Aye, sir.</i>

01:20:36.681 --> 01:20:39.254
Torpedoes?

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:41.426
Trust me.

01:20:42.353 --> 01:20:47.311
- 1100 yards to target and closing.
- Ha-cha-cha!

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.476
Up periscope.

01:20:51.529 --> 01:20:54.483
<i>(series of commands)</i>

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:58.277
Seal.

01:20:58.369 --> 01:21:00.278
Squawk on hands-free.

01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:05.829
- Bearing mark.
- 2-6-3.

01:21:05.918 --> 01:21:07.994
Range 9-0-0.

01:21:08.087 --> 01:21:11.041
- Second mark, sir?
- Haven't got the time.

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.705
Bearing 2-6-3.

01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:15.924
- Fire one.
- Fire one.

01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:26.347
Bearing 2-6-4. Range 8-5-0.

01:21:26.438 --> 01:21:28.894
- Fire two.
- Fire two.

01:21:36.782 --> 01:21:39.569
- Sir, we have a shooting solution.
- Well!

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.365
<i>Get the Stingray.
Give them the coordinates.</i>

01:21:42.454 --> 01:21:48.991
I want to tell them. He's targeted.
If he has the guts to acknowledge.

01:21:50.003 --> 01:21:54.749
Sir, it's that General Whatshisname again.

01:21:54.842 --> 01:21:57.842
Forget the phone. Put it on the squawk.

01:21:57.928 --> 01:22:00.004
OK. Yes, sir.

01:22:11.483 --> 01:22:15.979
<i>Submarine "Stingray",
this is submarine "Orlando".</i>

01:22:16.071 --> 01:22:18.396
It has been confirmed.

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:20.150
You are targeted.

01:22:20.826 --> 01:22:24.870
<i>Orlando, this is Stingray.
Stingray one speaking.</i>

01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:29.166
We acknowledge the kill and
congratulate all the fine men on your boat.

01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:31.290
Well, thank you, Captain.

01:22:31.378 --> 01:22:37.131
However, at the time of your transmission
I had already fired two torpedoes.

01:22:37.592 --> 01:22:41.127
- What?!
- You can probably hear them in the water.

01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:46.844
And though we are dead, our fish are on
their way to the naval station dummy ship.

01:22:46.935 --> 01:22:50.600
They hit, we still win.

01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:52.728
Aar-harr!

01:22:55.443 --> 01:22:58.113
You son of a bitch.

01:22:58.196 --> 01:23:00.817
Were those hot torpedoes or exercise shots?

01:23:00.907 --> 01:23:04.656
Sir, our fish are running hot,
straight and normal.

01:23:04.744 --> 01:23:09.287
If we aimed them right,
any kills should be visible in your scope.

01:23:14.587 --> 01:23:16.746
Ten seconds.

01:23:16.839 --> 01:23:21.548
Nine, eight, seven,

01:23:22.178 --> 01:23:24.965
<i>six, five,</i>

01:23:25.056 --> 01:23:28.306
four, three,

01:23:28.393 --> 01:23:31.263
two, one...

01:23:37.443 --> 01:23:40.230
- Sweet!
- Aar!

01:23:41.155 --> 01:23:43.231
Yes!

01:23:45.034 --> 01:23:47.786
God, I love this job!

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:50.540
Aar-harr-harr!

01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.142
<i>(faint cheering)</i>

01:25:06.406 --> 01:25:10.274
Sir, this exercise is invalid.
Dodge left the containment area...

01:25:10.369 --> 01:25:13.535
After you had narrowed it
without authorisation.

01:25:13.622 --> 01:25:16.291
He ignored a direct order.

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:22.911
Stow it, Yancy. He had higher orders.
And you can forget about that third star.

01:25:28.345 --> 01:25:30.421
<i>(calls marching pace)</i>

01:25:41.066 --> 01:25:43.142
Crew, halt.

01:25:45.403 --> 01:25:47.479
Crew, salute.

01:25:51.076 --> 01:25:54.445
Welcome back. You pushed
my order to the breaking point.

01:25:54.537 --> 01:25:57.823
Thank you, sir. I mean, if that's a compliment.

01:25:57.916 --> 01:26:00.621
However, under the circumstances,

01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:06.084
I will not be able to give you your own
Los Angeles class nuclear submarine.

01:26:06.174 --> 01:26:07.289
Yes, sir.

01:26:07.384 --> 01:26:11.844
You will be given instead
a new Seawolf class nuclear submarine

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:14.503
and will attend its launching on Friday.

01:26:14.599 --> 01:26:17.090
And this time you'll be given a proper crew,

01:26:17.185 --> 01:26:21.017
one commensurate with
your tactical and leadership abilities.

01:26:21.105 --> 01:26:24.391
- Thank you, sir, but I'd have to decline.
- Decline?

01:26:24.484 --> 01:26:29.276
I would not be in line for such a promotion
without the help of my present crew.

01:26:29.364 --> 01:26:35.865
I could not in good conscience
accept another command without them.

01:26:36.704 --> 01:26:41.200
- Still setting terms, huh, Dodge?
- Just respectfully requesting, sir.

01:26:44.003 --> 01:26:48.582
Well, at least you got my son to face forward.

01:26:49.926 --> 01:26:52.084
<i>(stifled laugh)</i>

01:26:52.178 --> 01:26:54.965
Your son? Stepanak, sir?

01:26:55.056 --> 01:26:57.843
Yes. It's his mother's name.

01:26:59.101 --> 01:27:01.639
His salute still leaves
something to be desired.

01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:05.394
- We'll work on that, sir.
- You do that, Commander.

01:27:15.284 --> 01:27:16.529
Dismissed!

01:27:26.504 --> 01:27:29.670
Live it up, guys. You earned it.

01:27:29.757 --> 01:27:33.885
Thank you, sir. I'll try not to overdo it.

01:27:35.095 --> 01:27:39.307
What exactly is this tattoo
I keep hearing about?

01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:42.926
Well, it's a long story.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:50.600
It was just after the Murmansk brushing
incident. I believe you're familiar with that?
