02:21.002 --> 02:22.625
But I'm still
pissed off at Elise.

02:22.728 --> 02:24.420
I don't care who

02:24.523 --> 02:26.387
It you have something to

02:26.491 --> 02:30.253
Don't talk shit behind my back.

02:30.357 --> 02:32.186
The first tray of fish

Fuck.

02:42.507 --> 02:43.784
I don't really

02:43.887 --> 02:45.889
But I gotta tell you,
Elise is actually

02:45.993 --> 02:47.305
a really strong competitor.

02:47.408 --> 02:48.202
Hey.

02:48.306 --> 02:50.204
Can you and I talk?

02:50.308 --> 02:51.585

02:51.688 --> 02:52.482
JENNIFER: You know what?

02:52.586 --> 02:53.794
We gotta work together.

03:00.421 --> 03:01.560
They're the two weakest links.

urgently.

Yes, chef.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.252
Um, guys?

04:12.355 --> 04:13.563
Chef Ramsay just called.

04:20.536 --> 04:21.709
I thought we were

Holy crap.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.816
Is he sending someone

04:31.650 --> 04:35.930
But being a head chef isn'tjust about running a kitchen.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.587
It's about running a business.

04:37.691 --> 04:40.797
And one of the most profitableitems in the restaurant

04:40.901 --> 04:44.042
business is pasta.

04:44.145 --> 04:45.526
That's what's up.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.356
For your next

05:04.269 --> 05:05.097
Get out of here.

05:05.201 --> 05:06.547

05:06.651 --> 05:09.274
DANA: On season 10 we
had a similar challenge.

05:09.378 --> 05:10.793
And I won that challenge.

05:10.896 --> 05:12.208
So I'm feeling really confident.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.416
GORDON RAMSAY: How
much would you be

05:13.520 --> 05:14.452
prepared to spend on that dish?

05:14.555 --> 05:16.454
$38 would be what
I would pay for it.

05:16.557 --> 05:17.834
Dana, congratulations.

05:17.938 --> 05:20.837
Thank you.

05:20.941 --> 05:22.563
JENNIFER: Can I roll
shotgun with you?

05:22.667 --> 05:24.841
Let's get out of here.

05:24.945 --> 05:26.118
ELISE: Let's do this.

the value making

05:39.166 --> 05:41.237
three identical pasta entrees.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.618
And I need a small
piece of halibut.

05:42.721 --> 05:43.515
That one.

05:43.619 --> 05:44.758
So what's the price on that?

05:44.861 --> 05:46.587
The easy part is
buying the ingredients.

05:46.691 --> 05:47.692
Clams are $5.99 a pound.

05:47.795 --> 05:50.073
The hard part is
making that $20 mark.

05:50.177 --> 05:51.351
Give me eight, just
to be safe, please.

05:51.454 --> 05:52.766
CLERK: You got it.
- Thank you.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.837

and flip $1.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.392

06:00.152 --> 06:01.326
Lobster. $10.99.

06:01.430 --> 06:02.914
[scoff] I'm definitelygoing to take one of those.

06:03.017 --> 06:04.709
You can get a lot of
value out of a lobster.

06:04.812 --> 06:05.848
How you doing?

06:05.951 --> 06:07.332
May I have 12 ounces of
ground chicken, please?

06:07.436 --> 06:08.954
CLERK: 12 ounces ground chicken?- Yes, thank you.

06:09.058 --> 06:10.335
CLERK: You got it.
- Come on, Milly.

06:10.439 --> 06:11.923
We can't really get away
with charging that much

06:12.026 --> 06:13.234
more for ground chicken.

06:13.338 --> 06:14.719
I don't know what he's thinking.

06:14.822 --> 06:15.892

06:15.996 --> 06:17.480

Large shrimp, got it.

06:22.727 --> 06:23.693

06:23.797 --> 06:25.039
MICHELLE: I need--
ROBYN: Clams or mussels?

06:25.143 --> 06:26.006
Hey, I'm still talking to him.CLERK: We've got mussels.

06:26.109 --> 06:26.765

with him first.

06:26.869 --> 06:27.317
CLERK: We've got mussels.

06:27.421 --> 06:27.870

2 minutes to go.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.429
Can I get nine
pieces of the large

06:35.533 --> 06:36.534
instead of the extra large?

06:36.637 --> 06:37.673
As I'm going
through this market,

06:37.776 --> 06:39.744
I'm having to make a
lot of compromises.

06:39.847 --> 06:40.883
How much is it?

06:40.986 --> 06:42.298
Shrimp is really expensive.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.644
So instead of
getting jumbo shrimp,

06:43.748 --> 06:45.370
I have to get regular shrimp.

06:45.474 --> 06:46.406
And do you have ground pork?

06:46.509 --> 06:47.752
CLERK: We have ground pork, yep.- OK.

30 seconds to go.

06:55.587 --> 06:57.002

You, too.

07:18.645 --> 07:20.854
NARRATOR: Now the chefs
return to Hell's Kitchen

07:20.957 --> 07:22.407
to cook up some profits.

07:22.511 --> 07:25.721
Your 45 minutes starts now.

07:25.824 --> 07:26.687
Let's go, guys.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.102
That was a good run.
NICK: Guys.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.518
You guys starting to
roll your pasta out?

07:29.621 --> 07:31.934
Make sure you get that done.

07:32.037 --> 07:34.350
Milly, give us an insightinto your pasta, please.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.387
I'm doing a smoked chickenmeatball pasta with spaghetti.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.596
ROBYN: I don't think
Milly is making

07:38.699 --> 07:39.804
a smart decision right now.

07:39.907 --> 07:41.702
You want to make your dishas expensive as you can.

07:41.806 --> 07:43.946
You sure you want to
do chicken meatballs?

07:44.049 --> 07:46.673
I'm going to make my dish looklike it's a million dollars.

07:46.776 --> 07:47.570
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

07:47.674 --> 07:48.606
OK.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.055
I'm feeling real
good about my dish.

07:50.159 --> 07:51.747
I'm doing all of these
different little things

07:51.850 --> 07:53.507
to give it that elevated flavor.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.129
It should come off very well.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.890
I know what I need.

07:56.993 --> 07:58.339
NARRATOR: While
Milly is determined

07:58.443 --> 07:59.893
to deliver on his promise--

07:59.996 --> 08:00.928
30 minutes remaining.

08:01.032 --> 08:01.860
Yes, chef.

08:01.964 --> 08:03.241
MICHELLE: 30 minutes, y'all.

08:03.344 --> 08:05.657
NARRATOR: --the red team is busypreparing some unique dishes

08:05.761 --> 08:06.555
of their own.

08:06.658 --> 08:07.590
Michelle, what are you doing?

08:07.694 --> 08:09.661
Chef, I'm making
a pork pot sticker.

08:09.765 --> 08:10.593
A what, sorry?

08:10.697 --> 08:13.493
MICHELLE: A pot sticker, chef.

08:13.596 --> 08:15.702
So would you say that
pot sticker is pasta?

08:15.805 --> 08:17.358
MICHELLE: It's made
from, uh, pasta dough.

08:17.462 --> 08:19.050
But the word "pot
sticker" is not Italian.

08:19.153 --> 08:20.430
That's all.
MICHELLE: OK, chef.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.570
GORDON RAMSAY: It's
more of an Asian dish.

08:21.673 --> 08:22.881
MICHELLE: I'm going to
make a soup dumpling.

08:22.985 --> 08:24.469
ELISE: Call it a tortellini.

08:24.573 --> 08:26.851
I'll make an Asianinspired tortellini soup.

08:26.954 --> 08:27.955
It's a pasta challenge.

08:28.059 --> 08:28.887
MICHELLE: Yes, chef.

08:28.991 --> 08:29.957
Thank you.
Elise.

08:30.061 --> 08:31.096
Yes, chef.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.546
Give me an insight
into your pasta dish.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.686
I'm doing a play on paella.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.757
Just some-- paella is Spanish.

08:36.861 --> 08:37.689
Yes.

08:37.793 --> 08:38.897
Ladies, are we OK?

08:39.001 --> 08:40.174
ALL: Yes, chef.

08:40.278 --> 08:41.313
GORDON RAMSAY: Are youinterested in winning this?

08:41.417 --> 08:42.694
ALL: Yes, chef.

08:42.798 --> 08:45.766
We've got an Asian dish, andwe have a Spanish dish, when

08:45.870 --> 08:47.078
we should be making Italian.

08:47.181 --> 08:49.425
So I'm a little nervousright now for the red team.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.806
Uh, Jennifer, give
me something Italian.

08:50.909 --> 08:51.703
What is it?

08:51.807 --> 08:53.084
Chef, clams and
linguine, chef.

08:53.187 --> 08:56.570
Oh, thank god for that.

08:56.674 --> 08:57.847
Everyone got their
pasta rolled out?

08:57.951 --> 08:58.848
ROBYN: Yes.

08:58.952 --> 08:59.677
GORDON RAMSAY:
Halfway, blue team.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.368
22 and 1/2 minutes remaining.

09:01.471 --> 09:02.611
ALL: Yes, chef.

09:02.714 --> 09:03.991
CHEF JOCKY: Careful,especially with the raviolis.

09:04.095 --> 09:05.061
That pasta dries quick, yeah?

09:05.165 --> 09:06.511
Yes, chef.

09:06.615 --> 09:09.859
I am making a English pea andricotta ravioli with lobster.

09:09.963 --> 09:10.964
MILLY: How's everybody doing?

09:11.067 --> 09:11.896
Uh-oh.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.414
Ravioli is definitely a risk.

09:13.518 --> 09:14.657
The filling can
kind of seep out.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.245
There could be air pockets.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.764
So I can't really
afford to mess up

09:17.867 --> 09:20.249
my pasta right now, because Idon't have a ton of backups.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.251
Good thing I'm
testing these now.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.321
Last five, guys.

09:23.424 --> 09:24.529
Come up!

09:24.633 --> 09:26.255
I don't want my
dumpling to dry out.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.221
So I'm dropping them now.

09:27.325 --> 09:28.188
Stop saying "dumpling."

09:28.291 --> 09:29.327
Get it in your head.

09:29.430 --> 09:32.157
Michelle, call it a
ravioli or a tortellini.

09:32.261 --> 09:33.711
It's the same thing.

09:33.814 --> 09:34.746
Call it a ravioli.
- I know.

09:34.850 --> 09:35.851
That's what I'm
going to call it.

09:35.954 --> 09:37.542
DANA: You just called
it a dumpling again.

09:37.646 --> 09:38.474
GORDON RAMSAY: 10--
- Here we go.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.509
GORDON RAMSAY: 9--
- Lemon zest.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.407
GORDON RAMSAY: 8--
- Here.

09:40.510 --> 09:40.856
Thank you.
GORDON RAMSAY: 7--

09:40.959 --> 09:41.995
Yikes.

09:42.098 --> 09:43.479
GORDON RAMSAY: 6, 5--
- Come on, Michelle.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.480
Hurry up.
GORDON RAMSAY: 4--

09:44.584 --> 09:45.377
MICHELLE: I'm
working, I'm working.

09:45.481 --> 09:46.206
GORDON RAMSAY: 3--
- Excuse me.

09:46.309 --> 09:48.415
GORDON RAMSAY: 2, 1, and stop.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.766
I've invited two extremelyaccomplished chefs

09:54.870 --> 09:57.079
to help me judge this
incredible challenge.

09:57.182 --> 09:59.633
Our first guest judge hastwo amazing restaurants--

09:59.737 --> 10:02.498
Pizzeria Locale and
Frasca Food and Wine.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.983
Welcome James Beard
Award winning chef,

10:05.087 --> 10:06.709
Lachlan MacKinnon-Patterson.

10:06.813 --> 10:08.055
[applause]

10:08.159 --> 10:09.263
Thank you.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.540
Thank you very much.
- Good to see you.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.749
- [inaudible]
- You good?

10:11.852 --> 10:13.129
Fabulous.

10:13.233 --> 10:15.684
Now, our second guest judgeis executive chef and co-owner

10:15.787 --> 10:17.893
of the critically acclaimedUnion in Pasadena,

10:17.996 --> 10:19.239

best new restaurants

10:19.342 --> 10:22.035
in LA by "Los Angeles
Magazine," Bruce Kalman,

10:22.138 --> 10:22.967
ladies and gentlemen.

10:23.070 --> 10:24.865
[applause]

10:24.969 --> 10:26.280
Good to see you, bud.- Good to see you as well.

10:26.384 --> 10:27.178
You good?

10:27.281 --> 10:28.317
Yeah.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.490
Thank you so much,
gentlemen, for giving

10:29.594 --> 10:30.388
up your day to be here.

10:30.491 --> 10:31.285
Of course.

10:31.389 --> 10:32.562
DANA: The pressure is on.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.255
If anybody knows how to
price things on a menu,

10:35.358 --> 10:38.258
it's going to be a guy
who owns restaurants.

10:38.361 --> 10:40.674
Let's start off
with Jennifer, please.

10:40.778 --> 10:42.020
Let's go.
- Let's go, Jennifer.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.435
Come on, Jennifer.

10:43.539 --> 10:44.954
NARRATOR: The judges will nowdetermine how much they would

10:45.058 --> 10:47.129
be willing to pay for entree.

10:47.232 --> 10:49.683
The team with the
highest combined total

10:49.787 --> 10:51.029
will win the challenge.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.135
Jennifer, please
describe your dish.

10:53.238 --> 10:54.239
JENNIFER: Clam linguine.

10:54.343 --> 10:56.345
On the bottom there's
a sweet corn puree.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.726
It actually has great flavor.

10:57.829 --> 11:00.901
But from a textural standpointit's a bit overcooked.

11:01.005 --> 11:01.902
I agree.

11:02.006 --> 11:03.248
I almost like a
pasta with more bite.

11:03.352 --> 11:04.146
Pasta's too delicate.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.492
It's way too thin.

11:05.595 --> 11:08.081
Lachlan, if you were
to put this on a menu,

11:08.184 --> 11:09.427
how much would you
charge for it, please?

11:09.530 --> 11:10.670
Probably around $23 for this.

11:10.773 --> 11:11.671
GORDON RAMSAY: $23.
- Yeah.

11:11.774 --> 11:12.568
Thank you.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.465
Bruce.

11:13.569 --> 11:14.432
I would say $22.

11:14.535 --> 11:15.813
I wouldn't go above $22.

11:15.916 --> 11:16.917
$67.

11:17.021 --> 11:18.401
Not bad.

11:18.505 --> 11:19.851
Not too bad, but
not the greatest

11:19.955 --> 11:21.370
start that I was hoping for.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.509
Nick, let's go, please.
NICK: Yes, chef.

11:22.612 --> 11:23.406
Thank you.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.546
[applause]

11:25.650 --> 11:27.134
This is a very nice
looking dish, Nick.

11:27.238 --> 11:28.204
NICK: Thank you, chef.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.136
GORDON RAMSAY: Describe
the pasta, please.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.551
What you have
is an English pea

11:30.655 --> 11:33.693
and leek ravioli withricotta cheese and butter

11:33.796 --> 11:34.970
poached lobster meat.

11:35.073 --> 11:36.454
BRUCE KALMAN: The pasta
is nice and delicate.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.042
You did a wonderful
job with that.

11:38.145 --> 11:39.284
Thank you, chef

11:39.388 --> 11:40.803
Bruce, price wise, wherewould you go on that?

11:40.907 --> 11:41.908
$28.

11:42.011 --> 11:43.288
I would even say $30, perhaps.

11:43.392 --> 11:46.119
Because there's so much airtrapped inside the ravioli,

11:46.222 --> 11:47.776
I'm going to go down to $23.

11:47.879 --> 11:51.193
But strong out of the gate. $81.

11:51.296 --> 11:54.299
NICK: Giving me a 23 waspretty harsh, considering

11:54.403 --> 11:55.611
somebody else gave me a 30.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.061
But that's Chef
Ramsay's opinion,

11:57.164 --> 11:58.372
and I have to respect that.

11:58.476 --> 11:59.339
Dana, let's go, please.

11:59.442 --> 12:00.754
DANA: Yes, chef.

12:00.858 --> 12:04.137
I also cooked halibut when Iwon this challenge on my season.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.104
I want to win this
challenge again.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.968
I did a seafood pasta.

12:08.072 --> 12:10.971
On top you have a piece
of halibut, some shrimp.

12:11.075 --> 12:13.802
And folded in there
are some sauteed peas.

12:13.905 --> 12:15.424
Did you roll this
with a pasta fork?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.528
I did.
I used a fork.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.188
This is kind of a problem.

12:35.651 --> 12:36.790
NARRATOR: Chef
Ramsay has brought

12:36.894 --> 12:39.620
in two great restaurateursto help him judge

12:39.724 --> 12:41.346
the pasta profit challenge.

12:41.450 --> 12:42.831
Did you roll this
with a pasta fork?

12:42.934 --> 12:44.246
I did.
I used a fork.

12:44.349 --> 12:47.145
NARRATOR: And Bruce Kalman hasdiscovered a bit of a problem

12:47.249 --> 12:49.976
with Dana's seafood pasta dish.

12:50.079 --> 12:53.151
This is kind of a problem.

12:53.255 --> 12:55.050
Fuck.

12:55.153 --> 12:56.845
The fish is poorly cooked.

12:56.948 --> 12:59.364
Too much dairy, tooheavily clumped together.

12:59.468 --> 13:01.159
Like there's maybe a little
bit too much going on.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.505
Yes, a very good point.

13:02.609 --> 13:03.541
Lachlan, how much?

13:03.644 --> 13:04.818
Maybe about $23.

13:04.922 --> 13:07.338
I'd be willing to probablypay about $20 for this.

13:07.441 --> 13:09.823
$20 max for me.

13:09.927 --> 13:12.861
$63 total.

13:12.964 --> 13:16.416
[sigh] I was really hopingto come through for my team.

13:16.519 --> 13:18.901
And now I have this low score.

13:19.005 --> 13:19.937
Next up, Robyn, please.

13:20.040 --> 13:20.869
Let's go.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.802
This was not what
I was expecting.

13:22.905 --> 13:23.733
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.735
Robyn, describe
your dish, please.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.254
So you have a
Creole pasta dish

13:27.358 --> 13:29.463
right there with someshrimp, mussels, and clams.

13:29.567 --> 13:30.361
Amazing.

13:30.464 --> 13:31.362
Thank you, chef.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.639
The pasta is really
not overcooked.

13:32.742 --> 13:34.089
I like the texture.

13:34.192 --> 13:35.538
Like Chef said,
it's just-- yeah.

13:35.642 --> 13:37.782
It draws you in immediately.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.370
I would give this dish $30.

13:39.473 --> 13:40.336
I would give it $31.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.234
$28.

13:41.337 --> 13:42.338
Thank you, Chefs.

13:42.442 --> 13:43.236
GORDON RAMSAY: Good job.

13:43.339 --> 13:44.409
Total $89.

13:44.513 --> 13:45.410
Yes, baby.

13:45.514 --> 13:46.998
Great profit margin
from a $20 cost.

13:47.102 --> 13:48.206
Right.
Next up, Michelle.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.552
Let's go, please.

13:49.656 --> 13:52.901
NARRATOR: The women aretrailing by an astounding $40

13:53.004 --> 13:54.316
after two rounds.

13:54.419 --> 13:56.111
And Michelle will
have to hit pay

13:56.214 --> 14:00.149
dirt if the red team wants anyhope of staying in the game.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.564
Michelle. describe
the dish, please.

14:01.668 --> 14:05.361
Chefs, today I made for you aAsian inspired tortellini soup.

14:05.465 --> 14:07.708
Nice.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.124
The broth is delicious.
GORDON RAMSAY: Mm.

14:09.227 --> 14:10.504
Well done.MICHELLE: Thank you, chef.

14:10.608 --> 14:13.266
This is, I think, the firstdish where we've kind of nailed

14:13.369 --> 14:18.374
the pasta execution, the platingstyle, and the overall flavor.

14:18.478 --> 14:22.137
The extravagance and theelegance of it is awesome.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.070
For me, the yield out
of $20 looks amazing.

14:24.173 --> 14:25.416
BRUCE KALMAN: Yes.

14:25.519 --> 14:26.658
It's like we would do inour own professional kitchens.

14:26.762 --> 14:27.728
That's right.

14:27.832 --> 14:32.768
For me this is definitelylike a $34 dish.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.597
I would say maybe $31.

14:34.701 --> 14:36.289
It's a definite
$32 dish for me.

14:36.392 --> 14:37.186
Good job.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.187
Thank you.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.949
$97 total.

14:41.052 --> 14:44.228
Michelle and her pot stickersjust fucking killed it.

14:44.331 --> 14:46.195
Like, holy shit.

14:46.299 --> 14:47.438
Milly, let's go, please.

14:47.541 --> 14:51.166
[applause]

14:51.269 --> 14:52.512
Describe the dish for
the chefs, please.

14:52.615 --> 14:55.066
What I have here issmoked chicken meatballs,

14:55.170 --> 14:56.516
zucchini and squash strings.

14:56.619 --> 14:58.552
And the pasta is garlic noodles.

14:58.656 --> 15:00.037
Visually, average.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.798
BRUCE KALMAN: Same for me.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.456
It's kind of bland
and a little boring.

15:05.559 --> 15:06.353
It's a shame.

15:06.457 --> 15:07.389
They're way too dry.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.391
Honestly, it's
not very well done.

15:12.152 --> 15:15.880
On the high end I would haveto go, like, $18 for this.

15:15.984 --> 15:16.881
I'd say maybe $17.

15:16.985 --> 15:18.262
Yeah, I'm going to go $18.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.817
Wow, Milly. $53
yield on a $20 spend.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.714
Not good.

15:22.818 --> 15:24.509
Milly dug a big ditch for us.

15:24.613 --> 15:25.855
Who was chicken
meatballs, though?

15:25.959 --> 15:26.787
Like, really.

15:26.891 --> 15:27.927
Who wants to eat
chicken meatballs?

15:28.030 --> 15:28.893
Let's go.

15:28.997 --> 15:30.136
Elise, bring up
your pasta with you.

15:30.239 --> 15:31.068
All right, Elise.

15:31.171 --> 15:32.172
I'm feeling good.

15:32.276 --> 15:33.863
I'm hoping that
my dish will bring

15:33.967 --> 15:36.763
home the necessary dollars weneed to get up out of here.

15:36.866 --> 15:38.765
Ladies, leading by $4going into the last round.

15:38.868 --> 15:41.354
Elise, describe your
dish to our chefs.

15:41.457 --> 15:44.564
I made for you today aseafood pasta with sausage.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.496
Delicious.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.222
Right, really delicious.

15:47.325 --> 15:48.671
I mean, I want to finish this.

15:48.775 --> 15:49.569
Thank you.

15:49.672 --> 15:50.880
Yeah, I'm $30.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.296
I would give it
probably around $30.

15:52.399 --> 15:54.056
Probably do, like, $33.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.126
Thank you, chef.

15:55.230 --> 15:58.198
$93 yield on a $20 spend.

15:58.302 --> 15:59.096
Thank you, chef.

15:59.199 --> 15:59.959
Good job.

16:00.062 --> 16:01.132
Yes, yes.

16:01.236 --> 16:02.892
I want to say thanks,
Chef Bruce, for,

16:02.996 --> 16:04.722
you know, hooking your girl up.

16:04.825 --> 16:07.967
$97 lead right
now in the red team.

16:08.070 --> 16:09.209
Right, final pasta.

16:09.313 --> 16:10.176
This one has gotta be strong.

16:10.279 --> 16:11.073
Benjamin, please.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.178
Let's go.

16:12.281 --> 16:14.904
NARRATOR: Benjamin needs
to earn at least $98

16:15.008 --> 16:16.561
from the three
judges, which would

16:16.665 --> 16:20.565
be the best dish of the day,to secure a blue team victory.

16:20.669 --> 16:21.877
We have a lobster pasta.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.706
It's finished off with
a Pecorino Romano.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.778
Visually, this is themost cohesive actual pasta

16:26.882 --> 16:27.814
dish that I've seen so far.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.436
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah.
Well thought out.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.541
LACHLANMACKINNON-PATTERSON: Yeah.

16:30.644 --> 16:31.783
Great color.

16:31.887 --> 16:33.682
The lobster is
beautifully cooked.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.546
And it has a lot of liftand a lot of lightness.

16:35.649 --> 16:37.237
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah, youknow, it's a strong effort.

16:37.341 --> 16:38.445
Um--

16:38.549 --> 16:41.379
It's all riding on
Benjamin's shoulders.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.587
Come on, now.

16:42.691 --> 16:43.485
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

16:43.588 --> 16:46.039
Bruce, how would you mark?

16:46.143 --> 16:48.248
I would say $30.

16:48.352 --> 16:49.249
I would say $29.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.181
Yeah.

16:50.285 --> 16:51.769
I'm going to go $31.

16:52.770 --> 16:53.978
Yay!

16:54.082 --> 16:55.048
Ladies, congratulations.

16:55.152 --> 16:55.945
Finally!

16:59.846 --> 17:01.192
Yes!

17:01.296 --> 17:03.643
I'm, like, overjoyed that we'refinally getting out of Hell's

17:03.746 --> 17:05.334
Kitchen out of a punishment.

17:05.438 --> 17:07.371
It's been longer
than I can count.

17:07.474 --> 17:09.545
Will you all join me thinkingthese two extraordinary chefs

17:09.649 --> 17:10.546
for giving up their day.

17:10.650 --> 17:11.996
- Thank you.
- Brilliant.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.411
Great feedback.
Thank you so much.

17:13.515 --> 17:14.274
Thank you, chef.

17:17.588 --> 17:18.554
GORDON RAMSAY: Ladies.

17:18.658 --> 17:21.454
Finally, finally,
finally, a victory.

17:21.557 --> 17:23.870
Now, today all of
you are competing

17:23.973 --> 17:25.734
in a go-karting grand prix.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.149
This is going to be fun.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.255
GORDON RAMSAY: And I've arrangedan incredible lunch for you

17:29.358 --> 17:30.325
as well.

17:30.428 --> 17:32.051
Michelle, additional
bit of good news.

17:32.154 --> 17:34.053
Your dish tonight will
be featured on the menu.

17:34.156 --> 17:34.950
Oh, nice.

17:35.054 --> 17:35.847
Wow.

17:35.951 --> 17:36.814
Thank you, chef.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.333
- Now, get out of here.
- Yes, chef.

17:38.436 --> 17:39.506
Thank you, chef.
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

17:39.610 --> 17:40.887
Finally.

17:40.990 --> 17:41.784
Woo-hoo!

17:41.888 --> 17:43.338
We won!

17:43.441 --> 17:44.235
Oh, dear.

17:44.339 --> 17:45.167
Right, blue team.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.548
You're in for a
long, tiring day.

17:46.651 --> 17:50.483
Our pantries are in desperateneed of a serious cleaning.

17:50.586 --> 17:52.864
So I'd like all theracks dismantled, brought

17:52.968 --> 17:54.107
down, and cleaned behind.

17:54.211 --> 17:55.004
Yes, chef.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.730
GORDON RAMSAY: Now, fuck off.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.767
I think the scoreboardtells who is our weakest one

17:58.870 --> 18:00.182
right now, and who
should be highly

18:00.286 --> 18:01.770
disappointed in themselves.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.841
It should be Milly.

18:03.944 --> 18:05.946
That was-- that
was interesting.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.086
What?

18:07.189 --> 18:08.639
I did bad on the
challenge today.

18:08.742 --> 18:12.125
So I know everybody isgoing to be mad at Milly.

18:12.229 --> 18:13.195
Mm-hmm.

18:13.299 --> 18:14.955
I want to bust my
ass on the punishment.

18:15.059 --> 18:17.820
And I'm going to crush
dinner service tonight.

18:17.924 --> 18:18.856
Have fun!

18:18.959 --> 18:19.926
- Bye, all.
- About time.

18:20.029 --> 18:20.823
Huh?

18:20.927 --> 18:22.342
- It's about time.
- I know!

18:22.446 --> 18:23.274
[laughter]

18:23.378 --> 18:24.172
Shut up!

18:24.275 --> 18:26.588
See you laters.

18:26.691 --> 18:28.383
Oh, we get to be free.

18:28.486 --> 18:29.694
It feels so good out here.

18:29.798 --> 18:31.489
Let's blow this
popsicle stand, ladies.

18:34.768 --> 18:35.528
This is going to be fun.

18:40.015 --> 18:40.809
Oh, my god.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.706
I'm, like, scared.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.744
[8-bit music]

18:44.847 --> 18:47.402
I came here to win otherthings besides a go-kart race.

18:47.505 --> 18:49.404
But you know, I'mcompetitive on whatever I do.

18:54.857 --> 18:58.585
[laughs] Jennifer isdriving like a little grandma.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.449
Hey, Jennifer.

19:00.553 --> 19:01.450
See you later.

19:01.554 --> 19:02.348
Eat my dust.

19:05.627 --> 19:07.767
Am I the only one
that's afraid here?

19:07.870 --> 19:08.664
Go ahead, girls.

19:08.768 --> 19:10.770
Kill each other.

19:10.873 --> 19:14.187
DANA: So I look over my shoulderand Elise is about to pass.

19:14.291 --> 19:18.847
And I'm like, uh, this
girl's going down.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.298
Oh, come on.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.231
Sorry.

19:23.334 --> 19:25.647
ELISE: Cheaters never prosper.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.614
Oh.

19:27.718 --> 19:29.547
[laughs] See ya.

19:32.585 --> 19:33.758
Yes.

19:33.862 --> 19:35.657
Dana tried to run me offthe track so she could win,

19:35.760 --> 19:36.865
and she still got smoked.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.280
Eat my dust.

19:38.384 --> 19:40.248
You tried to run
me off the track.

19:40.351 --> 19:41.835
[poof] Now.

19:41.939 --> 19:43.251
- I didn't cheat.
- Should have passed me.

19:43.354 --> 19:44.148
Do what you gotta do.

19:44.252 --> 19:45.080
I couldn't go in reverse.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.357
I was like [screech]

19:46.461 --> 19:48.842
NARRATOR: As the red teamenjoys their victory lap--

19:48.946 --> 19:49.809
That was funny.

19:49.912 --> 19:51.500
NARRATOR: --back
in Hell's Kitchen

19:51.604 --> 19:56.988
one member of the blue teamseems to be on cruise control.

19:57.092 --> 19:57.955
ROBYN: I'm stuck with Milly.

19:58.058 --> 19:59.577
Like, I know how
this is going to be.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.061
I'm going to do all the work.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.167
Milly, you want to help mepick this up real quick?

20:03.271 --> 20:04.064
OK.

20:04.168 --> 20:06.170
It's fine.

20:06.274 --> 20:07.620
Ow.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.656
Fuck.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.796
Cheers to not doing
another punishment.

20:11.900 --> 20:12.694
[cheering]

20:14.005 --> 20:14.799
No punishment.

20:14.903 --> 20:16.525
Cheers.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.147
That was a good
rush of adrenaline.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.942
We do have to
win dinner service.

20:20.046 --> 20:21.737
But I think now
that Barbie's gone,

20:21.841 --> 20:23.946
we can get through a servicewithout fighting, yeah?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.572
No?

20:28.675 --> 20:29.607
Did I say no?

20:29.711 --> 20:30.608
DANA: You didn't say anything.

20:30.712 --> 20:31.575
I'm just listening.

20:31.678 --> 20:32.817
DANA: Oh.

20:32.921 --> 20:34.681
It's just awkward sittingwith a group of people,

20:34.785 --> 20:35.820
and we're all
trying to pretend we

20:35.924 --> 20:38.133
like each other when we don't.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.376
MICHELLE: I think
we should just take

20:39.479 --> 20:41.170
our high morale from earlier--

20:41.274 --> 20:43.345
Barbie wasn't the sole
problem of the red team.

20:43.449 --> 20:45.899
So I don't know why you'repinning it on Barbie, but--

20:46.003 --> 20:47.280
DANA: The fighting?

20:47.384 --> 20:48.177
Yeah.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.213
OK.

20:49.317 --> 20:52.043
The red team can't
even enjoy a reward.

20:52.147 --> 20:54.183
MICHELLE: You're going tomake us lose our appetites.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.875
We think, now
that Barbie's gone

20:55.978 --> 20:57.186
everything's going to be fine.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.119
But that's not the case.

20:59.223 --> 21:02.399
And as usual, Elise has
to bring something up

21:02.502 --> 21:04.746
to make everybody want
to get in a fight.

21:04.849 --> 21:06.713
So I'm just going
to leave it there.

21:13.444 --> 21:14.238
Awkward.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.419
Fuck is basil oil?

21:22.522 --> 21:23.523
Huh?

21:23.627 --> 21:25.422
CHEF JOCKY: The
fuck is basil oil?

21:25.525 --> 21:28.701
Chef Jocky has a very thick,extreme Scottish accent.

21:28.804 --> 21:30.496
There's not any proteinsin there, was there?

21:30.599 --> 21:31.842
There's what?

21:31.945 --> 21:34.638
Sometimes when he speaks, I'mkind of just like, oh, OK.

21:34.741 --> 21:36.605
Is that going to be allright in an aluminium pan?

21:36.709 --> 21:37.882
Excuse me?

21:37.986 --> 21:39.574
That's not going to getdiscolored in an aluminium pan?

21:39.677 --> 21:41.265
MILLY: We're in
American, Chef Jocky.

21:41.369 --> 21:42.611
What the fuck is that?

21:42.715 --> 21:46.615
Play with small dice ofcarrot and celery as well?

21:46.719 --> 21:48.065
OK, whatever you say.

21:48.168 --> 21:49.169
Evening, red team.

21:49.273 --> 21:50.101
[inaudible]

21:50.205 --> 21:50.999
What?

21:55.590 --> 21:57.039
Do you all have the mushrooms?

21:57.143 --> 21:58.800
Do you all havemushrooms over here, too?

21:58.903 --> 21:59.697
Here.

21:59.801 --> 22:00.940
Let me help you.

22:01.043 --> 22:02.562
How many do you all have done?

22:02.666 --> 22:04.461
[sighs]

22:04.564 --> 22:05.807
My dish is on
the menu tonight.

22:05.910 --> 22:07.705
Super awesome.

22:07.809 --> 22:08.913
I'm in the weeds
right now, so.

22:09.017 --> 22:09.811
Yeah.

22:09.914 --> 22:11.157
It's really easy.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.055
So I'm making sure everyoneknows what they're doing.

22:13.159 --> 22:14.678
So y'all just get somecolor on these mushrooms.

Yes, because we're
dwindling down.

35:02.997 --> 35:04.826
My vote is Dana,
for obvious reasons,

35:04.930 --> 35:07.035
just because the
tickets came back.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.865
And Michelle, because
you never listen.

35:08.968 --> 35:12.972
And you never assume
responsibility.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.112
JENNIFER: Honestly,
Elise, I think

35:14.215 --> 35:15.561
you did a good job tonight.

So I have to vote for Dana.

And I have to vote for Michelle.

35:18.875 --> 35:21.153

Um, yeah.

35:22.258 --> 35:23.051
Right now I do.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.504
Everyone would think thatthe obvious choice for me

35:27.608 --> 35:28.850
to vote for would be Elise.

35:28.954 --> 35:31.439
But I did form this littlealliance with Elise.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.136
I'm going to
vote for Jennifer.

35:38.239 --> 35:40.068

do I think would

35:40.172 --> 35:42.968
make the team the strongest,I'm going to vote for Elise.

35:43.071 --> 35:44.211
I didn't do shit tonight.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.075
to you.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.007

stronger than you.

35:48.111 --> 35:48.767

stronger than you.

35:48.870 --> 35:49.802

35:49.906 --> 35:50.803
That's just facts.
- That's not fact.

35:50.907 --> 35:52.357
It's opinion.
- No, that's fact.

35:52.460 --> 35:53.220
It's not facts.

35:53.323 --> 35:54.531
That's fact, Dana.

35:54.635 --> 35:56.050
Oh, you're so
fucking amazing, Elise.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.327
You know what, I-- thank you.

35:57.431 --> 35:58.225
I am.

35:58.328 --> 35:59.226
And I will continue to be.

35:59.329 --> 36:00.744
Thank you.
ELISE: You're welcome.

36:00.848 --> 36:01.469
Thank you.

36:01.573 --> 36:02.160
ELISE: You're welcome.

36:02.263 --> 36:02.988
You're a fucking bully.

36:03.091 --> 36:04.334
You can be mad all you want.

36:04.438 --> 36:06.060
You're the one who got uskicked out the kitchen tonight.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.683
But you can't base it
on just tonight only.

36:08.787 --> 36:09.995
I cooked with
perfection tonight,

36:10.098 --> 36:11.617
and they're trying
to put me up again.

36:11.721 --> 36:12.860
Michelle and Dana.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.275
They're definitely
like a clique.

36:14.379 --> 36:15.897
I'mma call them Dachelle.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.416
Because they one--
they one thing.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.281
They, like, Dachelle.

36:20.385 --> 36:22.456
I have two votes and Danahas two votes right now.

36:22.559 --> 36:23.422
Dana, you're my first vote.

36:23.526 --> 36:24.941
But no matter who
I vote for we're

36:25.044 --> 36:26.184
going to have a three-way tie.

36:26.287 --> 36:28.220
Because she's going tohave three, I'll have two,

36:28.324 --> 36:29.497
and one of you will have two.

36:29.601 --> 36:30.395
I don't know, guys.

36:30.498 --> 36:32.051
I don't-- I don't fucking know.

36:37.333 --> 36:38.886
ELISE: When Chef
Ramsay asks us tonight,

36:38.989 --> 36:40.267
we need to be on one accord.

36:40.370 --> 36:41.958
He's going to ask us
who is the weakest.

36:42.061 --> 36:43.580
I would say it was Michelle.

36:43.684 --> 36:44.857
Overall, I think it's Michelle.

36:44.961 --> 36:45.824
You think so?

36:45.927 --> 36:46.721
You think it's Dana?

36:46.825 --> 36:47.826
I think so.

36:52.831 --> 36:54.073
And if he asks you,
I think that should

36:54.177 --> 36:56.075
be said, that I don't evendeserve to be up there tonight.

36:56.179 --> 36:57.318
I'm just saying.

36:57.422 --> 36:59.527
Let's be on one accord whenwe fucking get up there.

36:59.631 --> 37:00.390
JENNIFER: OK.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.440
Everything you do inHell's Kitchen from now on in

37:15.543 --> 37:17.373
is under a microscope.

37:17.476 --> 37:18.857
Because I look at
all eight of you

37:18.960 --> 37:23.068
now and image one of you
running Hell's Kitchen.

37:23.171 --> 37:26.174
Red team, have you
reached a decision?

37:26.278 --> 37:29.626
Well, we have a tie.

37:29.730 --> 37:32.284
So we haven't
come to a consensus.

37:32.388 --> 37:33.768
The team is split, chef.

37:33.872 --> 37:34.700
Oh, no.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.921
Red team, have you
reached a decision?

37:49.025 --> 37:52.373
Well, we have a tie.

37:52.477 --> 37:54.237
So we haven't
come to a consensus.

37:54.341 --> 37:55.618
The team is split, chef.

37:55.721 --> 37:57.930
Oh, no.

37:58.034 --> 37:59.311
Jennifer give me
the nominations,

37:59.415 --> 38:00.485
please, first and why.

38:00.588 --> 38:02.383
Uh, Dana, chef.

38:02.487 --> 38:05.179
We all agree that tonightDana struggled on meat.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.076
Second nominee.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.112
DANA: We're split.

38:07.215 --> 38:08.769
I voted for Michelle, chef.

38:08.872 --> 38:13.532
Honestly, I just don'tthink she can lead us, chef.

38:13.636 --> 38:14.878
Third nomination.

38:14.982 --> 38:16.155
Elise, chef.

38:16.259 --> 38:19.676
Dana and Michelle boththink that if Elise was gone

38:19.780 --> 38:22.023
we would be stronger as a group.

38:22.127 --> 38:23.646
But I don't think so.

38:23.749 --> 38:25.406
Well, you said the
same about Barbie.

38:25.510 --> 38:28.961
Pretty much, Dachellealways votes the exact same.

38:29.065 --> 38:29.859
They're a clique.

38:29.962 --> 38:30.756
Who's a clique?

38:30.860 --> 38:31.688
Dachelle.

38:31.792 --> 38:32.758
Dana and Michelle.

38:32.862 --> 38:33.656
Dachelle.

38:33.759 --> 38:34.864
Got it.

38:34.967 --> 38:36.210
ELISE: It's facts.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.176
That's funny.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.143
Stupid.

38:38.246 --> 38:39.351
Chef, I voted
for Dana tonight.

38:39.455 --> 38:40.456
That's not true.

38:40.559 --> 38:41.974
How can we be a clique
if I voted for her?

38:42.078 --> 38:45.599
Elise, Michelle, Dana,
step forward, please.

38:45.702 --> 38:48.084
Holy mackerel.

38:48.187 --> 38:50.293
This is unbelievable.

38:50.397 --> 38:51.329
OK, Elise.

38:51.432 --> 38:52.640
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:52.744 --> 38:54.021
I should stay in
Hell's Kitchen, chef,

38:54.124 --> 38:56.920
because I'm a leader, I'm afighter, and I'm a great chef.

38:57.024 --> 38:58.612
I didn't come here
to just play around.

38:58.715 --> 39:00.959
I came here to win.

39:01.062 --> 39:02.478
Dana, why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:02.581 --> 39:04.203
Chef, I have passion.

39:04.307 --> 39:05.135
I have drive.

39:05.239 --> 39:06.861
Yes, tonight there
was a problem.

39:06.965 --> 39:09.070
But I'm not the weakest
member in this kitchen.

39:09.174 --> 39:10.520
I'm not.

39:10.624 --> 39:12.488
Michelle, why should youstay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:12.591 --> 39:13.937
I deserve to be here.

39:14.041 --> 39:17.182
I think to be a good leader youcan't take things personally.

39:17.285 --> 39:18.666
And you can't be defensive.

39:18.770 --> 39:21.359
And Elise definitely has
those two attributes.

39:21.462 --> 39:22.636
She fights with everyone.

39:22.739 --> 39:24.154
I haven't fought withanybody in the kitchen except--

39:24.258 --> 39:26.053
You fight every day with
people in the kitchen.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.226
That's a lie.

39:27.330 --> 39:28.745
That's false.- She fought with Barbie.

39:28.849 --> 39:30.022
ELISE: I haven't arguedwith anybody in the kitchen.

39:30.126 --> 39:31.127
She fought with Robyn.And she fought with Michelle.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.439
I didn't fight with
Robyn in the kitchen.

39:32.542 --> 39:34.199
Have we ever had a
fight in the kitchen?

39:34.302 --> 39:36.201
That one time on meat.

39:36.304 --> 39:37.098
Whatever.

39:37.202 --> 39:38.272
[scoff]

39:38.376 --> 39:41.206
Let's get this done.

39:41.309 --> 39:42.621
My decision is--

39:42.725 --> 39:46.936
[music swells]

39:47.039 --> 39:49.283
--Michelle.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.285
Back in line.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.217
Thank you, chef.

39:55.634 --> 39:57.325
My decision is--

39:57.429 --> 40:00.328
[music swells]

40:00.432 --> 40:01.226
--Elise.

40:04.781 --> 40:05.679
Get back in line.

40:05.782 --> 40:06.783
Thank you, chef.

40:06.887 --> 40:07.784
GORDON RAMSAY: Dana, come here.

40:10.442 --> 40:11.823
Breathe.

40:11.926 --> 40:13.963
You know, honestly,
first of all

40:14.066 --> 40:15.516
I can't wait to bring you back.

40:15.620 --> 40:16.966
But unfortunately,
today has been one

40:17.069 --> 40:19.278
of the worst days you ever had.

40:19.382 --> 40:21.073
I'm not feeling that leader.

40:21.177 --> 40:22.972
That's the thing that
needs to pop for me.

40:23.075 --> 40:24.318
Right now, you're
not ready to become

40:24.422 --> 40:25.457
my head chef in Hell's Kitchen.

40:25.561 --> 40:28.046
Please give me your jacket.

40:28.149 --> 40:30.220
[sigh] I wish you the best.

40:30.324 --> 40:31.532
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:31.636 --> 40:32.430
Fuck.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.091
DANA: I mean, let's face it.

40:39.195 --> 40:40.783
The red team is a disaster.

40:40.886 --> 40:42.232
Elise should be standing here.

40:42.336 --> 40:44.062
Elise wants to say
she's not a bully.

40:44.165 --> 40:47.721
But I think she uses
that facade to push

40:47.824 --> 40:50.482
people around when, really,she's insecure about herself.

40:50.586 --> 40:53.554
I came into this kitchenevery day and gave it my all.

40:53.658 --> 40:58.490
So to know that that wasn't
good enough, that hurts.

40:58.594 --> 41:01.873
Tomorrow, all of you are goingto face a day like you've never

41:01.976 --> 41:03.495
had before in this competition.

41:03.599 --> 41:05.980
Right now, it's more
important that you

41:06.084 --> 41:08.396
stand down as an individual.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.846
ALL: Yes, chef.

41:09.950 --> 41:11.814
Get out of here.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.747
MICHELLE: I don't think Jenniferwas being honest tonight.

41:13.850 --> 41:16.612
I think she said what shesaid as a strategic move.

41:16.715 --> 41:19.649
Those are all moves that ChefRamsay sees right through.

41:19.753 --> 41:20.995
He knows when
someone's lying to him.

41:21.099 --> 41:22.894
And he knows who the mosttalented people on the red team

41:22.997 --> 41:23.998
are.

41:24.102 --> 41:25.759
ELISE: [sigh] And
then there were seven.

41:25.862 --> 41:26.863
So check it out.

41:26.967 --> 41:29.107
There's Brangelina,
Bennifer, and Dachelle.

41:29.210 --> 41:30.004
And guess what?

41:30.108 --> 41:31.696
They all broke up.

41:31.799 --> 41:33.145
Michelle's on her own island.

41:33.249 --> 41:35.527
She won't stay
afloat by herself.

41:35.631 --> 41:36.839
You all right?

41:36.942 --> 41:38.047
Yeah.

41:38.150 --> 41:39.324
It just sucks.

41:39.427 --> 41:42.120
I don't know how long myalliance with Elise will last.

41:42.223 --> 41:45.088
Do I think Elise would pushme in front of a moving car?

41:45.192 --> 41:48.126
If she had the chance,
abso-fucking-lutely.

41:48.229 --> 41:49.092
But you know what?

41:49.196 --> 41:51.474
I'm ready for her.

41:51.578 --> 41:52.889
GORDON RAMSAY [VOICEOVER]:In two seasons,

41:52.993 --> 41:55.685
this was Dana's firsttime ever being nominated.

41:55.789 --> 41:58.930
Unfortunately for her,
it was also her last.

42:04.107 --> 42:06.558
NARRATOR: Next time on"Hell's Kitchen All Stars"--

42:06.662 --> 42:08.560
GORDON RAMSAY: It's
black jacket time.

42:08.664 --> 42:09.872
[cheering]

42:09.975 --> 42:12.840
NARRATOR: --with only fiveblack jackets up for grabs--

42:12.944 --> 42:14.842
Two of you will be going home.

42:14.946 --> 42:18.052
We're going to go fromseven to five really quickly.

42:18.156 --> 42:18.950
NARRATOR: --get ready--

42:19.053 --> 42:19.951
Don't push.

42:20.054 --> 42:21.400
NARRATOR: --for
the fiercest battle

42:21.504 --> 42:23.299
in Hell's Kitchen history.

42:23.402 --> 42:24.542
- I got it.
- I have it.

42:24.645 --> 42:25.612
No, I got it.

42:25.715 --> 42:27.614
This is going
to get cutthroat.

42:27.717 --> 42:28.994
NARRATOR: Who will rise?

42:29.098 --> 42:30.996
I've gotta get this win.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.411
NARRATOR: Who will fall?

42:32.515 --> 42:35.622
GORDON RAMSAY: The final chefreceiving a black jacket is--

42:35.725 --> 42:37.520
NARRATOR: And will one
of the toughest chefs

42:37.624 --> 42:39.833
ever just set foot
in Hell's Kitchen--

42:39.936 --> 42:41.317
I've been bringing my A-game.

42:41.420 --> 42:43.215
And now I'm going
to turn up the heat.

42:43.319 --> 42:44.976
NARRATOR: --finally
lose her cool?

42:45.079 --> 42:46.080
Describe the dish, please.

42:46.184 --> 42:46.978
OK.

42:47.081 --> 42:49.808
Um, I made-- uh--

42:49.912 --> 42:51.361
NARRATOR: It's
the most emotional

42:51.465 --> 42:53.225
episode of the season.

42:53.329 --> 42:54.572
I literally could
be going home.

42:54.675 --> 42:58.472
NARRATOR: Next time on"Hell's Kitchen All Stars."
