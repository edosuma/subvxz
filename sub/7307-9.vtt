WEBVTT

00:06.731 --> 00:09.186
They wouldn't even tell Sarah
how he died.

00:10.193 --> 00:12.399
I'm sure
his command had a good reason.

00:12.487 --> 00:13.518
Maybe.

00:13.613 --> 00:16.151
But if it was my husband,
I'd want to know.

00:17.158 --> 00:19.566
I still can't believe Jim's dead.

00:19.952 --> 00:23.037
It's almost like
he's standing here with us.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.283
How's Sarah handling it?

00:45.728 --> 00:46.843
Kidwell residence.

00:46.938 --> 00:48.598
Sarah, thank God, it's Jim.

00:48.689 --> 00:49.721
Who?

00:50.775 --> 00:52.186
Now, listen to me.

00:52.276 --> 00:54.767
- Who is this?
- Sarah, it's Jim.

00:54.862 --> 00:57.400
- We're still here. Don't believe them.
- What?

00:58.241 --> 00:59.403
Sarah?

00:59.992 --> 01:02.780
Sarah! Sarah! It's Jim!

01:03.287 --> 01:06.075
I'm not... I'm not dead!

01:45.672 --> 01:47.664
Shooters at the ready position.

01:47.757 --> 01:49.251
Nervous, Kate?

01:49.384 --> 01:50.498
Shaking.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.772
Cease fire, cease fire.
Clear and lock all weapons.

02:04.857 --> 02:07.099
All locked.
Now, shooters, check your targets.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.853
You nervous, Tony?

02:09.570 --> 02:11.362
Nice tactical reload.

02:13.992 --> 02:16.150
You only got your guy twice. I win.

02:16.369 --> 02:19.453
What are you talking about?
You shot the hostage's ear off.

02:19.539 --> 02:22.456
- She'll live.
- Yeah, without an ear.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.621
It's not bad. Both of you, not bad.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.870
Of course,
these targets don't shoot back.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.506
That must be next week.

02:29.590 --> 02:31.998
Kate, I think you're holding back.

02:32.427 --> 02:35.344
Shoot with confidence.
Relax your shoulders.

02:35.847 --> 02:37.045
Tony...

02:38.558 --> 02:39.756
That's a nice grouping.

02:39.851 --> 02:41.049
So I win.

02:41.436 --> 02:43.642
Oh, we're just getting warmed up.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.639
- Give me your cover.
- What for?

02:46.816 --> 02:47.931
Right.

02:50.153 --> 02:53.853
Come on, boss! I've been breaking
that cap in for three months.

02:53.948 --> 02:56.522
- I love that cap!
- Then don't shoot it.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.913
- Did you back this up?
- Oh, no, no, no. Gibbs.

03:09.005 --> 03:11.377
Come on. My whole life is in that thing!

03:13.051 --> 03:15.802
- Gibbs, come on.
- Then don't shoot it.

03:16.929 --> 03:19.930
- If we screw this up I have a suggestion.
- What?

03:20.016 --> 03:22.851
We break into Gibbs' basement
and we set his boat on fire.

03:22.935 --> 03:26.102
That's cold, Kate.
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.520
Gibbs.

03:30.735 --> 03:32.229
Yeah, we're on it.

03:32.737 --> 03:33.768
What's up?

03:33.863 --> 03:36.105
A Marine wife
buried her husband yesterday.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.479
Somebody thought it'd be fun

03:37.575 --> 03:39.733
to call her up on the phone
and harass her.

03:39.827 --> 03:41.784
Since when do we investigate
crank calls?

03:41.871 --> 03:44.658
Since the guy calling
is claiming to be her dead husband.

03:44.749 --> 03:47.370
On the firing line.
Ready on the right. Ready on the left.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.916
Fire. Let's see
how you do under pressure.

03:51.589 --> 03:54.258
- I'll bring the lighter fluid.
- Deal.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.048
Very cool.
Where can I get one of these?

04:03.142 --> 04:04.684
You can have that one.

04:04.769 --> 04:06.892
Really? Thanks.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.641
So, you said you needed help?

04:09.732 --> 04:12.270
Yeah, I'm trying to pull up
the records on a dead Marine,

04:12.360 --> 04:14.981
but my security access
won't go through.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.940
It's because
computers can sense fear, Tony.

04:19.534 --> 04:22.072
- Name?
- Major Jim Kidwell.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.118
He was working at Quantico.

04:24.205 --> 04:27.076
Mobile training teams.
This is his Social.

04:29.585 --> 04:33.001
- Is that a new perfume, Abby?
- Yep. I made it myself. You like it?

04:33.089 --> 04:34.666
Smells like gunpowder.

04:35.091 --> 04:36.633
Sweet, huh?

04:36.717 --> 04:38.627
- Here's your problem.
- What?

04:38.719 --> 04:41.471
Your security clearance
isn't high enough.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.225
How did he die?

04:45.351 --> 04:47.924
That's kind of what Gibbs wants me
to find out.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.096
Then it sucks to be you.

04:56.362 --> 04:57.856
In most of these cases,

04:57.947 --> 05:00.403
the caller turns out
to be someone you know.

05:00.491 --> 05:03.029
Old boyfriend, co-worker.

05:05.163 --> 05:07.404
Listen, I know it sounds crazy.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.369
But the voice.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.167
I could swear it was Jim's.

05:12.253 --> 05:13.712
Sometime in situations like this,

05:13.796 --> 05:15.876
you hear what you think
sounds like someone you know.

05:15.965 --> 05:18.883
I'd like to put a trace
on your phone, Mrs Kidwell.

05:18.968 --> 05:20.379
In case he calls back.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.296
What happens if it's Jim?

05:25.766 --> 05:26.929
Excuse me.

05:29.770 --> 05:32.308
It couldn't have been her husband,
could it?

05:33.608 --> 05:35.102
Hi. Hey, guys.

05:35.193 --> 05:36.735
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:36.819 --> 05:38.942
Why don't you guys go outside
and play?

05:39.030 --> 05:41.022
It's okay. I'll be along in a minute.

05:41.115 --> 05:43.357
- Okay, Mommy.
- Let's go.

05:43.451 --> 05:46.203
Agent Gibbs, Agent Todd,
this is Lisa Peary.

05:46.287 --> 05:48.860
Her husband was
in the same unit as Jim's.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.081
- They...
- Died together.

05:52.543 --> 05:54.287
You have our sympathies.

05:54.378 --> 05:56.537
What we'd really like is some answers.

05:56.631 --> 05:59.715
You know, we accepted the fact that
our husbands couldn't always tell us

05:59.800 --> 06:01.592
where they were, what they were doing.

06:01.677 --> 06:04.631
We played the game.
We were good Marine wives.

06:04.722 --> 06:06.430
You have to understand

06:06.724 --> 06:09.393
all we got back
were two sealed caskets.

06:09.477 --> 06:12.050
And now Sarah gets this call from Jim.

06:12.355 --> 06:15.225
Or someone impersonating him,
Mrs Peary.

06:15.399 --> 06:17.606
We don't even know how they died.

06:18.319 --> 06:21.273
Are you telling me
you wouldn't start to wonder?

06:28.412 --> 06:30.156
What'd you find out
about our dead Marine?

06:30.248 --> 06:32.406
He was involved in classified stuff.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.077
- And?
- No "and."

06:34.168 --> 06:37.371
I didn't have high enough clearance
to access the records.

06:37.755 --> 06:40.080
- What's your clearance?
- Confidential.

06:40.174 --> 06:41.205
Confidential?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.756
What'd you do,
kill someone in high school?

06:43.844 --> 06:45.303
Not funny, Kate.

06:45.388 --> 06:47.594
No, they screwed up my paperwork
with another agent's.

06:47.682 --> 06:49.923
Apparently DiNozzo died
in a car crash last month.

06:50.017 --> 06:52.093
- Very tragic.
- They yanked my clearance.

06:52.186 --> 06:53.930
Now I gotta take a physical
to get it back.

06:54.021 --> 06:56.939
- Why is that?
- To prove that I'm still alive.

06:57.024 --> 06:58.222
Any luck?

06:58.693 --> 07:01.610
Access denied!
And I was cleared for Air Force One.

07:01.696 --> 07:03.984
Yeah, so was an Al-Qaeda operative.

07:04.865 --> 07:05.897
Gibbs will get in.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.827
He's got clearance that'll let him see
the dead aliens at Area 51.

07:08.911 --> 07:10.987
'Cause he probably killed them.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.579
Looks like
someone is deliberately blocking us.

07:19.672 --> 07:20.703
Or a glitch.

07:20.798 --> 07:23.419
Everything doesn't have to be
a conspiracy against NCIS, guys.

07:23.509 --> 07:27.127
- Saying we're paranoid, Kate?
- If the shoe fits...

07:27.430 --> 07:28.675
Yeah, Gibbs.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.977
I know where it is.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.726
That was Kidwell and Peary's
commanding officer.

07:39.817 --> 07:41.359
We are being blocked.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.482
Okay.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.692
- I admit that is strange.
- He wants to meet with us.

07:46.782 --> 07:49.155
- When?
- Right now. Come on. Let's roll.

07:50.828 --> 07:52.406
Thanks for the new cap, Kate.

07:52.496 --> 07:55.996
Not a problem.
Only wish my warranty covered bullets.

08:00.296 --> 08:01.732
I appreciate you meeting me out here.

08:01.756 --> 08:03.567
I wanted to keep this conversation
off the record.

08:03.591 --> 08:04.836
Why is that, Colonel Walsh?

08:04.925 --> 08:06.717
Because Kidwell and Peary
were good men.

08:06.802 --> 08:08.712
Their widows seem to think so.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.631
I wanna keep it that way.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.326
Are you familiar
with mobile training teams?

08:12.350 --> 08:15.137
Sure, they serve as military advisors
in foreign countries.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.342
Among other things.

08:16.437 --> 08:18.679
Kidwell and Peary were working
out of country.

08:18.773 --> 08:22.058
Op was classified,
but had nothing to do with their deaths.

08:22.151 --> 08:25.520
- Why seal the records, then?
- Because of the way they died.

08:28.157 --> 08:30.944
Look, when you work
with a foreign military,

08:31.035 --> 08:32.363
you kind of have to go native.

08:32.453 --> 08:35.537
You have to live, breathe the culture.

08:35.623 --> 08:38.196
Kidwell and Peary tended
to take that approach to the extreme.

08:38.292 --> 08:40.866
- Define "extreme."
- We found them in a brothel.

08:40.961 --> 08:43.041
They had a dispute
with one of the local prostitutes.

08:43.130 --> 08:45.253
- She poisoned them.
- With what?

08:45.341 --> 08:47.049
Local police said formaldehyde.

08:47.134 --> 08:49.590
- Formaldehyde?
- She put it in their drinks.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.885
So you used
the classified nature of the operation

08:51.972 --> 08:53.052
to cover it up.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.118
I didn't exactly wanna
call Lisa and Sarah and tell them

08:55.142 --> 08:57.431
that their husbands died
because they pissed off a whore.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.800
Probably a good call.

08:58.896 --> 09:01.387
Look, they weren't angels,
but they were damn good Marines.

09:01.482 --> 09:03.475
And I'd rather
they be remembered that way.

09:03.567 --> 09:06.734
Any idea why someone would
call Mrs Kidwell and impersonate him?

09:06.821 --> 09:09.857
None. But I hope you catch
that son of a bitch.

09:11.742 --> 09:14.909
Look, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

09:15.538 --> 09:17.411
Just one more thing, Colonel.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.869
I'm still gonna need to see the records.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.870
I just told you what happened.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.501
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

09:28.050 --> 09:29.675
I'll see what I can do.

09:35.266 --> 09:37.839
His body language matches that of
someone telling the truth.

09:37.935 --> 09:39.726
Or he's one hell of a liar.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.471
Yeah, Gibbs.

09:43.566 --> 09:45.938
The techs that installed the phone trace
at the Kidwells'

09:46.026 --> 09:47.225
found something interesting.

09:47.319 --> 09:48.351
What'd you find?

09:48.446 --> 09:50.106
There was already a trace on the line.

09:50.197 --> 09:53.317
- And it's pretty sophisticated stuff.
- Were you able to trace it?

09:53.409 --> 09:57.276
Almost. The tracking software lost it
around Dumfries, Virginia.

09:57.371 --> 10:00.325
- That's right outside of...
- Marine Base at Quantico.

10:02.501 --> 10:03.912
Where's he going?

10:05.212 --> 10:07.288
- Can I help you, sir?
- NCIS.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.831
We need to talk to your CO,
Lieutenant Colonel Walsh.

10:09.925 --> 10:12.381
- He's in a meeting right now, sir.
- Here?

10:12.470 --> 10:15.221
- Sir, I don't think you heard me.
- Oh, he heard you.

10:15.306 --> 10:16.420
Sir!

10:19.226 --> 10:20.886
Where's Colonel Walsh?

10:24.231 --> 10:25.607
Right here.

10:36.986 --> 10:40.485
Someone is going to a lot of trouble
over a crank phone call, Colonel.

10:40.572 --> 10:43.657
Like an illegal wiretap
on Sarah Kidwell's phone.

10:43.742 --> 10:45.818
And a guy pretending he's you.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.276
I wanna know why.

10:47.371 --> 10:49.280
Well, that makes two of us,
Agent Gibbs.

10:49.373 --> 10:51.496
You think
I like getting Marines back in boxes?

10:51.583 --> 10:55.035
Why don't we start with
how Major Kidwell and Peary died?

10:55.129 --> 10:58.083
- Oh, that's need-to-know.
- Trust me, I need to know.

10:58.173 --> 10:59.917
Unfortunately, it seems I don't.

11:00.009 --> 11:01.551
Their records are sealed.

11:01.635 --> 11:03.960
And every inquiry I've made
has been shot down.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.679
You have two dead Marines, Colonel.

11:05.764 --> 11:08.255
Are you trying to tell me
you don't know how they died?

11:08.350 --> 11:10.094
This is an admin command.

11:10.185 --> 11:12.012
When my teams deploy,
they could be working

11:12.104 --> 11:14.560
for any one of a dozen agencies.
They don't report to me.

11:14.648 --> 11:17.982
- Who did Kidwell and Peary report to?
- Officially, the State Department.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.444
Unofficially.

11:19.611 --> 11:22.648
You're gonna have to figure that one out
for yourselves, Agent Gibbs.

11:22.740 --> 11:24.898
Now, what does that sound like
to you, Tony?

11:24.992 --> 11:27.862
It sounds like one of the A's. CIA, NSA...

11:28.495 --> 11:31.532
About those boxes
you got back, Colonel.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.572
What about them?

11:33.667 --> 11:36.502
Did you stop to see
if your men were inside them?

11:36.587 --> 11:38.745
Or is that need-to-know, too?

11:44.928 --> 11:47.301
- We're being played, sir.
- So it seems.

11:47.598 --> 11:48.926
Question is why?

11:49.016 --> 11:51.721
Either they died doing something
they weren't supposed to be doing,

11:51.810 --> 11:53.767
or Kidwell made that phone call.

11:53.854 --> 11:55.763
Or, as a third alternative,

11:55.856 --> 11:59.355
they died on a classified mission
serving their country.

11:59.443 --> 12:01.186
I don't buy it, sir.

12:01.570 --> 12:05.188
Someone wants us off this case.
There's gotta be a reason.

12:06.617 --> 12:09.618
It's not the first time we've bumped up
against other agencies.

12:09.703 --> 12:11.826
Out in the field, there's always a reason.

12:11.914 --> 12:15.662
This time there's a couple of
Marine wives caught in the middle, sir.

12:19.713 --> 12:20.958
What do you suggest?

12:21.048 --> 12:24.084
I need your help
to gain access to their records.

12:26.595 --> 12:28.386
I'll make some calls. In the meantime,

12:28.472 --> 12:31.757
see what you can find out
about this phoney colonel of yours.

12:39.483 --> 12:41.191
Make the eyes bigger, Abby.

12:41.276 --> 12:42.308
No! The eyes are fine.

12:42.402 --> 12:44.123
It's the nose
that needs to be bigger, Abby.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.568
Okay, I'll get the APB out
on Pinocchio right away.

12:46.657 --> 12:49.195
- You guys...
- Welcome to my world, Abby.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.076
Thank you, Gibbs.

12:52.329 --> 12:54.156
Anyone want to explain this?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.496
Tony and I were
just discussing the shape

12:57.584 --> 12:59.126
of our bogus colonel's face.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.749
We haven't quite settled
on the nose yet, though.

13:01.839 --> 13:03.997
Yeah, I can see that, DiNozzo.

13:04.091 --> 13:05.965
Listen, boss,
we need a few more minutes,

13:06.051 --> 13:08.279
- so if you wanna go grab a coffee...
- I got a better idea.

13:08.303 --> 13:10.462
Pull Kidwell and Peary's LES's for me.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.014
- Kate and I'll...
- I'll do that.

13:12.099 --> 13:14.305
That is, if you want me to.

13:14.393 --> 13:18.343
It's just that Tony seems to have
a better handle on the program here.

13:20.524 --> 13:21.639
Okay.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.525
Okay, how do we reset this, Ab?

13:34.663 --> 13:37.284
- What's an LES?
- Leave and earnings statement.

13:37.374 --> 13:39.782
- And how would one get...
- Marine Corps Finance Centre,

13:39.877 --> 13:42.165
- Kansas City. What's the deal?
- Thanks.

13:47.885 --> 13:48.964
That's correct.

13:49.052 --> 13:52.172
Major James Kidwell
and Major Craig Peary.

13:52.764 --> 13:56.299
I need their leave and earnings
statements for the last couple of years.

13:56.393 --> 13:57.804
Fax is fine.

13:58.061 --> 14:00.303
Attention, Special Agent Todd.

14:01.398 --> 14:02.940
Thanks, Sergeant.

14:09.239 --> 14:12.406
Make the chin a little bigger, Abby,
and I think we'll have him.

14:12.492 --> 14:15.577
- That's him!
- Yeah, sure is.

14:15.746 --> 14:16.908
Ducky.

14:17.873 --> 14:18.904
Nice.

14:19.541 --> 14:22.744
While you were playing,
I sketched our fake colonel.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.250
Whoa! I didn't know you were an artist.

14:25.339 --> 14:27.248
- That rocks!
- I'm impressed.

14:27.341 --> 14:28.751
Let me see that.

14:31.094 --> 14:33.301
- What the...
- That's personal.

14:33.388 --> 14:35.215
Yeah, it is.

14:36.892 --> 14:40.427
- Do you really see me like that?
- I'm really impressed now.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.642
Abby, I didn't mean anything by that.
It's...

14:46.735 --> 14:49.273
I love that!
You've gotta let me hang it up.

14:49.363 --> 14:51.123
I can't wait to see
the one you did of Gibbs.

14:51.198 --> 14:53.440
Oh, just give me that. Give it to me!

14:55.410 --> 14:57.783
So, Kansas City said
that it would take 24 hours

14:57.871 --> 14:59.471
to get the leave
and earnings statements.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.740
You've got 12.
I wanna see it first thing in the morning.

15:01.833 --> 15:02.913
Come on.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.038
Abby, run his likeness through.

15:05.128 --> 15:08.747
Concentrate on government
employee databases, DOD personnel.

15:08.924 --> 15:10.501
You got it, Gibbs.

15:10.592 --> 15:13.463
What does he expect to find
from their LES's?

15:13.553 --> 15:15.926
Come on, Kate. That's like NCIS 101.

15:16.223 --> 15:17.717
You have no idea, do you?

15:17.808 --> 15:18.970
Not a clue.

15:59.266 --> 16:02.599
Kate, 12 hours was up 15 minutes ago.

16:02.686 --> 16:04.975
- Next time, have them fax them in order.
- Point taken.

16:05.063 --> 16:07.020
Gibbs, are you gonna tell us
what these are for?

16:07.107 --> 16:08.305
Agent Gibbs.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.058
Mrs Kidwell.

16:12.154 --> 16:13.648
There was another phone call.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.609
And this time we have proof
that Jim's still alive.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.078
Jim left a message on my machine
the same day he called Sarah.

16:21.163 --> 16:22.242
The funeral?

16:22.331 --> 16:23.891
Yes. With everything that was going on,

16:23.915 --> 16:26.185
I didn't have time to check
my messages until this morning.

16:26.209 --> 16:28.617
You seem pretty confident
that's Kidwell, Major.

16:28.712 --> 16:32.295
I've known Jim since we were
second lieutenants at The Basic School.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.422
It's his voice, Agent Gibbs.

16:34.509 --> 16:36.549
Well, we're about to find out.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.381
- Abby?
- Yeah!

16:39.264 --> 16:41.553
- Sorry.
- Let's hear what you got.

16:41.641 --> 16:45.224
Okay. This is the old school version.

16:45.729 --> 16:48.481
Danny. Tell Sarah... Trust... Got...

16:48.565 --> 16:50.890
Find Peary... Call mobile.

16:51.902 --> 16:54.190
You can tell that's him from that?

16:54.279 --> 16:58.324
Well, lucky for you,
you got a mix master in the hizzouse.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.859
- A what?
- It means "house."

17:00.952 --> 17:02.411
You need to get out more, Gibbs.

17:02.496 --> 17:05.165
Word. Okay, here's the filtered version.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.787
Danny. Tell Sarah... Trust... Got...

17:09.877 --> 17:12.250
Find Peary... Call mobile.

17:12.339 --> 17:16.337
I ran it against six word samples I had
from the Kidwells' home videos.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.714
- They didn't match.
- So it's not Kidwell on the tape?

17:18.804 --> 17:23.015
That's what I thought at first, too,
but I forgot to factor in the phone line.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.258
Ma Bell eliminates any frequency

17:26.353 --> 17:30.053
that's below 400 hertz or above 3,400.

17:30.148 --> 17:32.686
It allows for
longer distance transmissions.

17:32.776 --> 17:34.021
That's why when people think

17:34.111 --> 17:35.902
they sound different
on the phone, they do.

17:35.987 --> 17:38.313
- It's all about the band...
- Mix master.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.648
Today.

17:44.538 --> 17:48.405
Danny. Tell Sarah... Trust... Got...

17:48.959 --> 17:51.035
Find Peary. Call mobile.

17:56.591 --> 17:58.798
We've got a dead man calling.

18:06.935 --> 18:07.966
If you could sign this.

18:08.061 --> 18:11.097
Sorry I couldn't help you
with the digging, boys.

18:11.189 --> 18:13.727
- Old pro basketball injury.
- All right.

18:14.651 --> 18:16.311
You played pro ball?

18:17.279 --> 18:20.233
Well, I was watching a game
while it happened.

18:23.243 --> 18:25.152
Top's been screwed shut, boss.

18:25.245 --> 18:28.661
They obviously didn't want
anyone looking in before the funeral.

18:28.748 --> 18:29.993
Or getting out.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.325
I don't see
why Sarah can't be present for this.

18:32.419 --> 18:35.503
Do you know what's in this box,
Major O'Donnell?

18:35.839 --> 18:37.417
No, but it's not Jim Kidwell,

18:37.507 --> 18:40.757
unless he's figured out a way
to make calls from the grave.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.585
Well, you know what?
We're gonna find out.

18:48.685 --> 18:51.603
But don't we have to wait for Ducky?

18:51.688 --> 18:55.187
Kate, if there's a body in here,
it's not going anywhere.

18:59.321 --> 19:01.693
I'm just hoping it's not another mummy.

19:14.461 --> 19:15.789
Oh, my God.

19:17.881 --> 19:20.550
I gotta admit, I wasn't expecting that.

19:21.218 --> 19:22.593
He looks alive.

19:25.055 --> 19:26.383
It's...

19:27.265 --> 19:28.546
It's Jim.

19:38.584 --> 19:40.079
Okay, come on.

19:43.923 --> 19:45.631
We sure screwed that up.

19:45.716 --> 19:49.050
Yep. Still doesn't explain
the cover-up and fake colonel.

19:49.887 --> 19:52.888
They're called classified ops
for a reason, Tony.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.050
- We'll probably never know.
- The phone call?

19:55.143 --> 19:57.680
Your calling plan
include the afterlife, Kate?

19:57.770 --> 19:59.977
Voice recognition isn't an exact science.

20:00.064 --> 20:02.057
Neither is Gibbs' gut.
And he's convinced

20:02.150 --> 20:04.142
there's more going on here
than a crank call.

20:04.235 --> 20:07.402
Well, I hate to break it to you, Tony,
but Gibbs can be wrong sometimes.

20:07.488 --> 20:08.567
Name once.

20:08.656 --> 20:11.147
The man's been married,
like, four times.

20:11.534 --> 20:12.909
There is that.

20:13.244 --> 20:14.572
There is what?

20:16.330 --> 20:19.000
Nothing, boss.
Just discussing the case.

20:20.042 --> 20:22.035
Or lack thereof.

20:22.753 --> 20:25.042
You still wanna take a look
at those LES's?

20:25.131 --> 20:28.001
I don't know.
You figured out how Kidwell died yet?

20:29.093 --> 20:32.592
I'll... I'll just get
them in order for you.

20:32.972 --> 20:34.087
Kate?

20:34.390 --> 20:36.098
It was three times.

20:36.893 --> 20:38.091
Not four.

20:42.607 --> 20:44.932
I'm afraid we've got
a bit of a mystery here, Gibbs.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.686
Tell me something I don't know, Duck.

20:46.777 --> 20:49.019
Our major appears
to be in perfect health.

20:49.113 --> 20:52.648
Except for the part where he's dead.
I need to know how and when.

20:52.742 --> 20:54.366
Yeah, how I'm still working on.

20:54.452 --> 20:57.025
When is another question entirely.

20:57.121 --> 21:00.656
Yes, the young man
has been embalmed.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.122
And whoever did the job
was definitely a pro.

21:03.211 --> 21:05.998
- How can you tell?
- My grandfather owned a funeral home.

21:06.088 --> 21:09.339
We spent a lot of quality time
bonding over the embalming table.

21:09.425 --> 21:11.631
Do you know what a trocar is, Tony?

21:11.719 --> 21:14.292
I'm guessing
it's not an alien on Star Trek.

21:14.388 --> 21:17.674
It's from the French.
Trocart. Three quarts.

21:17.767 --> 21:20.174
It's used to enter the abdominal cavity

21:20.269 --> 21:23.887
so that the lungs and other
major organs can be drained of fluids.

21:23.981 --> 21:27.397
Now, as you can see,
whoever did this barely left a mark.

21:27.485 --> 21:29.312
He does look good for a dead guy.

21:29.403 --> 21:32.321
Well, skin tone is simulated by dyes.

21:32.406 --> 21:35.111
Every mortician
has his own family recipe.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.992
This is one of the best I've seen.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.453
Can you tell me when he died?

21:38.537 --> 21:40.032
He's been perfectly preserved.

21:40.122 --> 21:42.198
He could've died days ago,
or even months.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.999
It's impossible to tell which.

21:44.085 --> 21:47.952
Official cause of death is listed as
"in the line of duty," two weeks ago.

21:48.047 --> 21:50.205
Well, two weeks I can believe.

21:50.383 --> 21:55.341
But LOD usually implies an accident,
or an injury received in combat.

21:55.429 --> 21:56.509
Look.

21:56.764 --> 22:00.429
Besides minimal bruising of the wrists,

22:00.518 --> 22:03.554
I mean,
there's no sign of any external trauma.

22:03.688 --> 22:05.645
But his insides... Here.

22:08.943 --> 22:10.817
Outside of the embalming process,

22:10.903 --> 22:13.774
there's no evidence
of any internal injury.

22:13.864 --> 22:16.190
There's a rumour going around
he might have been poisoned.

22:16.284 --> 22:17.315
That's possible.

22:17.410 --> 22:20.613
But the tox screens wouldn't be able
to detect it.

22:20.705 --> 22:21.736
Why's that?

22:21.831 --> 22:24.997
His blood's been replaced
by embalming fluid.

22:25.084 --> 22:27.326
Formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.041
And looking for another toxin
would be like looking for a...

22:30.131 --> 22:31.957
A needle in a haystack.

22:32.049 --> 22:35.252
A dead Marine
with no obvious cause of death.

22:35.636 --> 22:38.174
And someone
who didn't want us digging him up.

22:38.264 --> 22:40.221
Give you any ideas, Duck?

22:40.308 --> 22:42.680
One in particular does come to mind.

22:42.768 --> 22:44.013
Me, too.

22:44.478 --> 22:46.767
Keep looking. Need an answer soon.

22:48.274 --> 22:50.729
He's talking about murder, gentlemen.

22:51.527 --> 22:52.690
I knew that.

22:57.116 --> 23:00.402
I don't suppose
you'd be willing to phone me, Major,

23:00.703 --> 23:02.031
and tell me how?

23:04.040 --> 23:06.365
Kidwell's leave
and earning statements are on top.

23:06.459 --> 23:10.159
- Two years' worth. Now what?
- Even top-secret spooks get paid.

23:10.755 --> 23:12.415
And this will help us because...

23:12.506 --> 23:14.067
The government
records everything, Kate.

23:14.133 --> 23:15.212
Days at sea,

23:15.301 --> 23:18.088
when they receive
hazardous duty and combat pay.

23:18.387 --> 23:19.550
Divorces.

23:19.638 --> 23:23.221
His records may be sealed,
but if we follow his paycheck...

23:23.309 --> 23:25.301
We'll find out where he was stationed.

23:25.394 --> 23:26.770
And who was paying him.

23:26.854 --> 23:28.894
You have one hour
to break that down for me.

23:28.981 --> 23:31.188
Red tape that's actually useful.

23:31.275 --> 23:33.564
- Who knew?
- Gibbs.

23:33.819 --> 23:35.942
You know what really ticks me off?

23:36.197 --> 23:38.273
- Gibbs?
- No.

23:38.741 --> 23:41.232
These guys get paid more than I do.

23:42.953 --> 23:44.068
Gibbs.

23:44.163 --> 23:47.034
I don't appreciate being interrogated,
Agent Gibbs.

23:47.249 --> 23:49.657
Well, why don't we start with,
who is this?

23:49.752 --> 23:51.127
Lisa Peary.

23:51.212 --> 23:54.082
Don't you think I would have told you
if Jim Kidwell called me?

23:54.173 --> 23:57.542
Well, exactly who is
interrogating you, Mrs Peary?

23:57.635 --> 23:59.462
He said his name's Agent DiNozzo.

23:59.553 --> 24:02.091
- When did this happen?
- He's here right now.

24:07.436 --> 24:08.467
Where?

24:08.562 --> 24:10.021
Coleman Park.

24:10.648 --> 24:12.142
I can be there in 15 minutes.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.521
Does he know
I'm on the phone talking to you?

24:14.610 --> 24:16.152
No, I don't think so.

24:16.237 --> 24:19.072
See if you can't keep him there
until I get there.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.782
Interesting, Gerald.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.358
Gerald!

24:25.788 --> 24:28.077
I'm sorry.
I was listening to a football game.

24:28.165 --> 24:30.205
You're wearing a CD player.

24:31.085 --> 24:33.492
Are you trying to tell me
you find me boring?

24:33.587 --> 24:34.963
Never mind.

24:35.798 --> 24:37.292
What do you make

24:37.383 --> 24:40.752
of this material
filling the incision cavity?

24:41.011 --> 24:43.337
Well, my grandfather
normally used cotton,

24:43.431 --> 24:46.716
but in a pinch we sometimes packed it
with old newspaper.

24:47.309 --> 24:48.887
To Abby, please.

24:49.061 --> 24:50.721
Sure. Right away.

24:53.149 --> 24:56.233
Football. Honestly.

25:03.117 --> 25:04.611
Oh, dear Lord.

25:06.662 --> 25:09.283
I believe I know how you died, Major.

25:12.418 --> 25:15.087
And may the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

25:20.384 --> 25:21.415
Mrs Peary.

25:21.510 --> 25:25.342
Oh, hi. I tried to keep him here,
but I think he knew something was up.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.263
- Does this look like the man?
- Yes.

25:28.350 --> 25:30.676
If he doesn't work for NCIS,
who does he work for?

25:30.769 --> 25:32.679
I don't know,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

25:32.771 --> 25:34.374
- Which way did he go?
- Five minutes ago.

25:34.398 --> 25:37.684
- Wearing a black windbreaker.
- Take your kids home. I'll be in touch.

25:37.776 --> 25:40.647
- Kids, let's go! Come on!
- Okay, Mom.

25:43.491 --> 25:45.033
Look, I'm done, chief.

25:47.578 --> 25:49.037
I don't think so.

26:04.845 --> 26:06.221
You son of a...

26:14.230 --> 26:15.475
That's twice.

26:16.106 --> 26:17.898
Next time you are mine.

26:22.071 --> 26:25.903
September,
his unit code changed to 30370.

26:25.991 --> 26:28.482
His DSN changed to...

26:28.577 --> 26:30.369
No, slow down! Slow down. Please.

26:30.454 --> 26:32.577
How could you work
in law enforcement your entire life

26:32.665 --> 26:34.075
and not learn how to type?

26:34.166 --> 26:37.452
- I'm a man of action, Kate.
- Yeah, more like an action figure.

26:37.545 --> 26:39.502
Why? You wanna play with me?

26:39.880 --> 26:42.751
As in you look good,
but you really can't do much.

26:42.841 --> 26:44.122
But I look good.

26:48.931 --> 26:51.766
Gibbs, is there anything
you wanna tell us about?

26:51.850 --> 26:53.843
I got shot at by our fake colonel.

26:53.936 --> 26:56.142
No way. Did you nail him?

26:57.940 --> 26:59.055
Nope.

27:02.444 --> 27:03.855
What did you guys find?

27:03.946 --> 27:05.144
Right.

27:07.658 --> 27:11.738
In September,
Peary and Kidwell were transferred

27:11.829 --> 27:13.656
from SATCOM to a new unit.

27:13.747 --> 27:16.832
We got the RUC number, but they're
not listed in the Marine Corps database.

27:16.917 --> 27:18.798
Wouldn't be.
They weren't working for the Corps.

27:18.877 --> 27:19.957
Definitely CIA.

27:20.045 --> 27:21.456
How do you know that?

27:21.547 --> 27:25.331
How many agencies do you know that
drive economy-class armoured cars?

27:27.720 --> 27:30.389
Come on. Ducky wants to talk to us.

27:31.098 --> 27:32.972
He's really pissed off.

27:33.392 --> 27:35.301
What? How can you tell?

27:40.024 --> 27:42.859
I really need
to get better at reading men.

27:43.152 --> 27:46.651
It was quite brilliant, actually.
I almost missed it.

27:46.739 --> 27:49.858
But while I was examining
the embalming incision,

27:50.618 --> 27:54.615
I discovered that the carotid artery
showed absolutely no sign of decay.

27:54.955 --> 27:58.407
Yes, I once saw a similar case
in West Germany, where a young boy...

27:58.500 --> 28:01.038
Duck, we don't have time for stories
on this one.

28:01.128 --> 28:02.207
Fine.

28:02.546 --> 28:06.129
But first, I'd like to ask a question.

28:07.343 --> 28:10.676
Do you people find me boring?

28:11.096 --> 28:12.176
- No.
- Of course not.

28:12.264 --> 28:13.509
Absolutely not.

28:14.433 --> 28:16.260
Can we get back to this now?

28:16.852 --> 28:17.931
Yes.

28:18.437 --> 28:21.687
I then checked the vitreous for toxins.

28:21.774 --> 28:22.972
Vitreous?

28:23.067 --> 28:24.312
Eyeball jelly.

28:24.401 --> 28:25.895
Very good, Kate.

28:26.695 --> 28:30.147
Here, the concentrations of methanol
confirmed my suspicions.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.656
The reason I was unable
to determine the cause of death

28:33.744 --> 28:35.737
was because our Major

28:37.289 --> 28:40.041
was alive when they embalmed him.

28:46.048 --> 28:49.333
The stuff inside Kidwell's neck
was definitely newspaper.

28:49.927 --> 28:51.801
I'm still processing the scraps.

28:51.887 --> 28:55.505
Most of it's unreadable,
but what I do have is in Spanish.

28:55.599 --> 28:57.722
That means
that Kidwell and our fake colonel were

28:57.810 --> 28:59.886
probably in Central
or South America recently.

28:59.978 --> 29:03.430
I could run his likeness past
Marine detachments on embassy duty.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.982
Yeah. Run it.

29:05.943 --> 29:07.603
Okay, DiNozzo, what's it say?

29:07.695 --> 29:10.731
Something about
farmer's markets and shoes required.

29:10.823 --> 29:12.815
Yeah, but look at this.

29:16.370 --> 29:17.745
December 12.

29:18.122 --> 29:20.280
That can't be right.
That was two days ago.

29:20.374 --> 29:22.580
- The funeral was on the...
- Eighth.

29:22.668 --> 29:24.744
So how does a guy
get into a coffin that was buried

29:24.837 --> 29:27.292
four days before he supposedly died?

29:29.049 --> 29:31.623
They knew we were going to dig him up.

29:32.428 --> 29:35.263
They killed him
and hoped we wouldn't notice.

29:35.681 --> 29:37.804
We know Kidwell was murdered.

29:38.058 --> 29:41.926
And that lying sack of excrement
is somehow involved.

29:43.439 --> 29:47.271
- What? You prefer I call him a sack...
- The question now is,

29:47.359 --> 29:50.313
what happened to Major Peary?
Is he still alive?

29:50.404 --> 29:51.602
There's an easy way to check.

29:51.697 --> 29:53.939
What? You think Mrs Peary's
just gonna give us permission

29:54.032 --> 29:55.776
- to dig up his grave?
- I don't know, Kate.

29:55.868 --> 29:57.907
I wasn't planning on asking her.

29:59.079 --> 30:01.914
- Hey, guys.
- Abby, you track this guy down?

30:02.207 --> 30:05.410
Not yet, but I've only heard back
from about half of the embassies.

30:05.502 --> 30:07.080
What is this thing, Abby?

30:07.171 --> 30:09.210
Ground-penetrating radar.

30:10.758 --> 30:11.956
Gibbs didn't tell you?

30:12.050 --> 30:13.295
Tell us what?

30:13.969 --> 30:17.089
You're going grave-robbing tonight.

30:23.353 --> 30:25.145
This is so not right.

30:25.856 --> 30:29.439
I mean, it's not like we couldn't have
done this during daylight.

30:29.943 --> 30:31.687
You afraid of ghosts, Tony?

30:31.779 --> 30:34.566
No, I'm afraid of getting shot
for trespassing.

30:34.656 --> 30:36.316
Where the hell is Gibbs?

30:36.408 --> 30:37.523
Right here.

30:38.076 --> 30:39.619
Don't do that.

30:39.703 --> 30:41.328
Did you calibrate the radar yet?

30:41.413 --> 30:43.738
Just about. Check this out.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.411
Oh, yeah.

30:48.170 --> 30:49.333
Lookit.

30:51.256 --> 30:53.213
What's that by the feet?

30:54.426 --> 30:55.837
I don't know.

30:58.889 --> 31:00.087
Fluffy.

31:01.058 --> 31:02.766
That must have been
one lonely old lady.

31:02.851 --> 31:04.760
And one pissed-off poodle.

31:05.437 --> 31:07.809
Okay, bring it over here.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.599
Let's see if Major Peary's home.

31:11.777 --> 31:12.939
All right.

31:14.196 --> 31:16.354
The casket's metal, boss.

31:18.700 --> 31:21.488
I'm getting some false signatures, but

31:22.704 --> 31:25.195
there is definitely something in there.

31:25.290 --> 31:28.208
And it is not Major Peary.

31:36.660 --> 31:39.032
You can run, but you cannot hide.

31:39.371 --> 31:40.995
What's up, Jack?

31:41.081 --> 31:44.082
I have a friend
that's looking forward to beating you.

31:44.167 --> 31:46.325
Courtesy of the Marines
at the Colombian Embassy.

31:46.419 --> 31:48.044
His name's Jack Canton.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.215
Should be enough
to get the Director of the CIA out of bed.

31:51.299 --> 31:52.758
Tired, Kate?

31:52.968 --> 31:55.755
- It's 3:00 a.m., Gibbs.
- Better get moving, then.

31:56.179 --> 31:57.258
On what?

31:57.347 --> 32:01.297
Need to know where the newspaper was
published that was found in Kidwell.

32:01.393 --> 32:04.678
- Tonight?
- Technically speaking, it's this morning.

32:06.273 --> 32:09.024
Those Marines we were talking about
the other day.

32:09.109 --> 32:11.267
What were they doing
in Colombia, Bob?

32:11.361 --> 32:14.445
Well, they were part of a task force
that was helping the locals

32:14.531 --> 32:16.856
hunt down Carlos Morales.

32:16.950 --> 32:19.571
He's the head
of the Putumayo drug cartel.

32:19.661 --> 32:21.239
How did they die?

32:22.205 --> 32:23.403
Poisoned.

32:23.957 --> 32:25.665
Insurgents kidnapped them.

32:25.750 --> 32:28.241
We paid the ransom,
but they killed them anyway.

32:28.336 --> 32:29.367
It happens.

32:29.462 --> 32:32.084
How much was the ransom,
Mr Director?

32:35.510 --> 32:37.419
$2 million. Why?

32:38.722 --> 32:40.050
Put it up.

32:41.057 --> 32:44.011
Was this the agent responsible
for paying it?

32:48.106 --> 32:49.565
And if it is?

32:50.734 --> 32:54.399
We think he kept the money for himself.
Now he's trying to cover it up.

32:54.487 --> 32:57.524
Those are pretty bold accusations,
Agent Gibbs.

32:57.907 --> 32:59.734
You have any proof of this?

32:59.826 --> 33:01.949
Major Peary wasn't in his grave.

33:02.203 --> 33:05.537
And Kidwell was alive four days ago.
You tell me, sir.

33:05.623 --> 33:07.331
Where is he now, Bob?

33:09.044 --> 33:11.961
Well, now he's on his way
back to Colombia.

33:12.047 --> 33:15.380
Look, if any of this turns out to be true,
we will handle it.

33:15.467 --> 33:20.294
I do not need NCIS
playing Internal Affairs for my agency.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.925
Understood.

33:27.771 --> 33:29.265
Go get our Marine.

33:38.281 --> 33:41.116
I'd like to officially go on record
as saying

33:41.493 --> 33:45.325
I really, really miss
the Gulfstream we took to Gitmo.

33:45.747 --> 33:47.122
You hungry, Kate?

33:48.041 --> 33:50.958
Oh, Tony, do I look hungry to you?

33:51.711 --> 33:54.498
Now that you mention it,
you kind of look like...

33:55.507 --> 33:57.084
Tell me that's normal.

33:57.175 --> 33:58.290
Sure.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.967
Now, that I'm not so sure about.

34:05.850 --> 34:06.965
Great.

34:08.311 --> 34:10.516
How long till we get to Colombia?

34:10.813 --> 34:13.768
It's not long. Five, six hours, tops.

34:17.027 --> 34:19.946
Okay, is he really sleeping,
or is that just an act?

34:20.114 --> 34:21.822
No, he's really sleeping.

34:22.449 --> 34:23.992
How can you tell?

34:25.661 --> 34:27.156
He looks peaceful.

34:37.424 --> 34:39.996
Morning. Sleep well?

34:40.092 --> 34:42.797
If by "well" you mean
violently throwing up all night

34:42.887 --> 34:44.368
and bouncing around like rag dolls...

34:44.431 --> 34:46.838
Then, yeah, boss, we slept very well.
Thanks for asking.

34:46.933 --> 34:48.511
Oh, you get used to it.

34:48.601 --> 34:50.344
That's what I'm afraid of.

34:50.437 --> 34:53.936
Sir, we'll be landing
in about 30 minutes.

34:54.023 --> 34:56.431
Did you hear back
from the embassy yet, Staff Sergeant?

34:56.525 --> 34:57.727
The Marines are expecting you.

34:57.777 --> 35:01.027
They won't let Canton's partner
leave his office until you get there.

35:01.114 --> 35:04.198
Okay. My compliments to the pilot.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.867
What you looking for, Kate?

35:12.959 --> 35:14.619
The ladies' room.

35:16.671 --> 35:18.331
Okay, the men's room.

35:20.467 --> 35:21.712
There's no men's room.

35:21.801 --> 35:24.802
Then how the hell
am I supposed to go to the bathroom?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.258
You're kidding, right?

35:28.766 --> 35:31.851
No way. Forget it. I can wait.

35:31.936 --> 35:34.225
Okay. Suit yourself.

35:43.281 --> 35:45.439
Damn it. Where?

35:45.742 --> 35:47.153
If you want some privacy,

35:47.243 --> 35:49.699
probably go down
behind those boxes there.

35:49.829 --> 35:51.573
God, I miss Air Force One.

35:57.253 --> 35:58.582
What do you mean, you lost him?

35:58.671 --> 36:00.629
We tracked Canton
to an insurgent camp.

36:00.715 --> 36:03.918
- By the time we got there, he was gone.
- What do you think about that, Kate?

36:04.010 --> 36:07.260
Do you think Agent Gonzales here
is working for Canton?

36:07.722 --> 36:10.842
It's possible. $2 million can go
a long way in Colombia.

36:10.934 --> 36:13.140
If I was rogue,
you think I'd be sitting in this office

36:13.228 --> 36:14.936
sweating my ass off, Agent Todd?

36:15.021 --> 36:17.097
I don't know. Let me see your ass.

36:18.775 --> 36:20.335
Canton doesn't even know
we're onto him.

36:20.401 --> 36:22.630
And he's probably gonna
walk in through this door tomorrow.

36:22.654 --> 36:24.340
Yeah, well, that's a good plan,
except by then.

36:24.364 --> 36:26.190
Peary will probably already be dead.

36:26.282 --> 36:28.820
The newspaper we found on Kidwell
was published in Bosa.

36:28.910 --> 36:30.452
That's about 10 miles from here.

36:30.537 --> 36:32.613
How many funeral parlours
would you say they have?

36:32.705 --> 36:34.698
What does that have to do
with anything?

36:34.791 --> 36:35.953
Humour us.

36:43.299 --> 36:46.004
- That's Canton's car out front.
- How'd you know?

36:46.094 --> 36:49.463
Because he embalmed Major Kidwell
when he was still alive.

36:49.764 --> 36:51.389
He's joking, right?

36:51.474 --> 36:54.428
Canton told your agency the Marines
were poisoned two weeks ago?

36:54.519 --> 36:56.179
Yeah, with formaldehyde.

36:56.729 --> 36:59.481
Well, if Peary's body turns up
stabbed, shot or beaten,

36:59.566 --> 37:00.645
he blows his cover.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.086
And then there's the time of death.

37:02.110 --> 37:04.482
He can't have two-day-old bodies.
The embalming hides it.

37:04.571 --> 37:06.314
- It's a perfect cover-up.
- No such thing.

37:06.406 --> 37:09.110
I always knew
he was a sick bastard, but that's just...

37:09.200 --> 37:10.825
Here, hold on, Gibbs. This isn't the US.

37:10.910 --> 37:13.995
- I gotta call the Colombians in on this.
- Well, you do that.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.330
Tony, take the front door.
Kate and I will go around back.

37:19.335 --> 37:22.289
Now I know why
everyone in the CIA hates these guys.

38:15.433 --> 38:16.975
Get them out of here.

38:38.748 --> 38:40.159
- You ready?
- Yeah.

38:43.461 --> 38:44.741
Maybe not.

38:50.259 --> 38:51.588
Grenade!

39:00.978 --> 39:03.220
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

39:03.898 --> 39:05.689
- Is that my blood?
- No.

39:19.956 --> 39:22.791
Gibbs, I know you're out there.

39:23.209 --> 39:25.332
Answer me, or I'll pop this Marine.

39:25.712 --> 39:28.381
Jack. It's me, Gonzales.

39:29.966 --> 39:31.080
I'm coming in!

39:31.175 --> 39:34.793
This doesn't concern you, Gonzales.
I want Gibbs. Unarmed.

39:46.566 --> 39:47.976
I said Gibbs.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.698
The Marine is next.

39:56.075 --> 39:58.032
If he dies, you die.

39:58.286 --> 40:01.868
- You don't get past me.
- Look, I just wanna talk to you, okay?

40:03.499 --> 40:04.780
Why don't I believe that?

40:04.876 --> 40:07.082
From where I'm standing,
you don't have much choice.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.839
You want your Marine back,
you deal with me.

40:11.382 --> 40:12.497
Okay.

40:14.719 --> 40:16.343
Relax your shoulders.

40:17.513 --> 40:19.589
What's it gonna be, Gibbs?

40:23.144 --> 40:24.686
I'm coming in.

40:47.460 --> 40:50.033
$2 million. And it was all mine.

40:50.379 --> 40:51.874
But you wouldn't let up.

40:51.964 --> 40:54.835
You really think
I'm gonna let you walk out of here?

40:56.594 --> 40:58.717
I figured you were gonna say that.

40:59.722 --> 41:01.465
I can't believe you trusted me.

41:01.557 --> 41:03.550
You sound just like my ex-wife.

41:10.233 --> 41:11.893
Kick the ball straight.

41:13.903 --> 41:16.145
Good hit, Zack. Watch me kick.

41:17.406 --> 41:18.901
Hey, that's...

41:38.845 --> 41:40.921
Daddy! It's Daddy!

41:41.514 --> 41:44.349
Daddy! Daddy, I missed you!

41:44.433 --> 41:46.093
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

41:51.274 --> 41:52.768
I really missed you.

41:54.777 --> 41:56.106
Thank you.

41:57.405 --> 41:59.278
Thank you all so much.

42:25.057 --> 42:27.216
Oh, God, what happened to your ear?

42:28.603 --> 42:29.883
I'll live.

42:38.321 --> 42:40.112
I'm telling you,
that wasn't my fault, Kate.

42:40.197 --> 42:41.478
Oh, so it was mine?

42:41.574 --> 42:43.317
Gibbs saw the whole thing.
Let him decide.

42:43.409 --> 42:44.607
Fine. Ask him.

42:44.702 --> 42:46.030
I will.
