WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.481
Previously on All Rise...

00:03.525 --> 00:06.484
I think it's time I met
your soon to be ex-husband.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.443
I thought the papers
have already been submitted.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.314
Amy said she was gonna hold off
sending them until

00:10.358 --> 00:12.664
- the insurance guy settled.
- Miles Paulo, my client.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.492
- What are you looking for?
- I think there's a mastermind

00:14.536 --> 00:16.668
behind the smash and grabs,
and I need a name.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.280
Maddy this is Mark Callen.
He is a prosecutor.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.804
If you tell him what you know
about Brandon Page,

00:21.847 --> 00:23.632
he will make
sure you're protected.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.590
I need you to change
the witness name on the warrant

00:25.634 --> 00:27.592
- from Gloria to Maddy, okay?
- Yeah, of course.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.291
Zoya Hamid, assistant
United Stated attorney.

00:30.334 --> 00:33.381
I'm sure we can pool resources.
Work together.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.513
Brandon Page is mine.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.776
I will no longer be helping
out on the Brandon Page case.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.343
Things need
to get back to normal.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.563
Once you apologize to Mark,

00:41.606 --> 00:45.132
then we can talk
about normal.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.758
- Came to my senses?
- Yeah.

01:46.802 --> 01:50.675
I'm not the one who tip toed
into the living room last night.

01:50.719 --> 01:53.200
- I went to go check on Bailey.
- Mmhmm.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.506
And to make sure
you came to your senses.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.813
Listen, I don't know--

01:57.856 --> 01:59.815
I don't know
if it's that new nanny.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.251
Hmmm?

02:01.295 --> 02:05.560
Or if Bailey's
moving into a new phase.

02:05.603 --> 02:09.651
But... all that noise you making
last night, she didn't budge.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.610
I made noise?

02:12.654 --> 02:14.351
It was--
Kamila Harris heard you.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.833
You screamed.
I heard a pitch.

02:18.703 --> 02:21.184
- Come here.
- Again?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.838
Yeah.

You're here early.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.291
Hey. So are you.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.989
Yeah. Have to work overtime
to get through all the backlog

02:44.033 --> 02:45.600
since the emergency
orders were lifted.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.210
Got you staying
busy up there, huh?

02:47.254 --> 02:50.170
- Yeah.
- Whole crew working hard.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.392
- You?
- I am here for Maddy Hernandez.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.828
She's Callan's main witness

02:56.872 --> 02:58.395
in the smash and grab
conspiracy case.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.744
So you're taking her on as
a client.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.660
Defacto client.
Her sister Gloria begged me.

03:02.704 --> 03:06.838
You know, the wholistic law
of it all can be so exhausting.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.580
Well, you make
it look good, Lopez.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.584
What would I do without
you constantly pumping me up?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.673
Don't know, and hopefully
we never have to find out.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.371
Hey, Em.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.374
Carol mentioned she wanted
to talk to you about something.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.638
Oh. I-- I will try
to make it up there.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.423
And if you do, there might
be dinner in it for you.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.645
Bye.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.777
- Have a good day.
- You too.

Good morning, Your Honor.
Good morning, Your Honor.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.194
Oh!
Good morning, Sherri.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.285
We have a big day today.
The pre-- Okay. Thank you.

04:02.329 --> 04:05.114
The prelim on the smash
and grab case is starting today.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.898
How did it go with your parents?

04:06.942 --> 04:08.770
I didn't get-- Well,
I wasn't allowed to see them.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.076
Then try again.
This can wait.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.949
- No, you don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.256
But you are worried,
which makes me worried.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.345
So... go.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.999
Try again.
I'll be fine here.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.570
Oh, okay.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.573
-
- Judge Carmichael.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.749
Judge Laski. Judge Mashal.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.751
Pretty ballsy,
the way you managed to keep

04:33.795 --> 04:36.363
Brandon Page's conspiracy
case in the state court.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.973
Without turning
him over to the Feds.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.105
Mr. Callan
has a very well laid out plan

04:40.149 --> 04:43.892
against Mr. Page,
but what do I owe the honor

04:43.935 --> 04:45.633
of having
both of you in my chambers?

04:45.676 --> 04:47.417
It seems that Laski and I

04:47.461 --> 04:49.854
are up for
the presiding Judge position.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.944
Yes, I know that.
And what do you need from me?

04:52.988 --> 04:56.600
Your support apparently carries
a lot of weight around here.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.081
- My support? But I've just--
- Believe me, I was just

04:59.124 --> 05:01.997
as surprised. Nonetheless,
your high-profile campaign

05:02.040 --> 05:05.130
and subsequent win have put you
in very high regard around here.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.219
- At least for the moment.
- For the moment, that is.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.786
Yes, that's right.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.354
Remember you came in here
asking for my support.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.095
Will miracles never cease.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.533
Let your
conscious be your guide.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.883
Do not let him
being here before me,

05:18.927 --> 05:21.059
color your decision in any way.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.976
Like the pun,
I threw up in there?

05:26.543 --> 05:30.460
<i>♪ When we're flowing</i> <i>into eternity ♪</i>

05:31.853 --> 05:35.335
Did he just use the word
color for code?

05:35.378 --> 05:37.467
That's what I heard.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.557
<i>♪ Eternity</i>

05:48.435 --> 05:50.219
- Ames.
- Collier.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.047
Oh my-- you look great.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.833
New medication
has been a breeze.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.053
So, what are you
doing here?

05:58.096 --> 06:00.708
I figured Mark told
you we made up last night.

06:01.273 --> 06:03.232
No, he didn't tell me that.

06:04.059 --> 06:07.105
Why haven't you told him that
the divorce papers were signed?

06:07.149 --> 06:08.846
Been signed.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.631
Is there something
I should know about?

06:10.674 --> 06:13.068
- Are you having second thoughts?
- What? No. Gosh, no.

06:13.111 --> 06:16.593
I just-- I wanted to
make sure you were okay first.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.770
- I got to go talk to him.
- Good morning.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.729
Ames I didn't
meant to upset you.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.513
No. I'm not upset.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.341
I mean, I am.
But not at you.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.038
I'll talk to you later, Collier.

06:27.082 --> 06:30.564
Wait, you're Collier
Amy where are you going?

06:30.607 --> 06:32.696
To the HOJ.
To rip Mark's head off.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.698
- Meet me there.
- Okay.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.787
- I'm--
-

06:39.442 --> 06:42.010
Oh, my god. Wow.

06:42.053 --> 06:47.537
Yes!!
I passed the bar.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.585
Ah, passed the bar.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.110
Oh, my god, yes!

06:58.287 --> 06:59.941
Okay, I think we're good.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.770
I don't know, Mr. Callan.
If I were you I'd take this

07:02.813 --> 07:04.554
to a Grand Jury
and seek an indictment.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.251
What are you
talking about Baby Biswas?

07:06.295 --> 07:08.123
We have the evidence
seized from Page's house

07:08.166 --> 07:10.125
and Maddy's testimony.
Our case is rock solid.

07:10.168 --> 07:12.432
Better be, or Feds are going
to be all over this office

07:12.475 --> 07:13.781
if it isn't,
that's for damn sure.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.739
- DA Lewis, bravo.
- Speak of the devil.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.915
AUSA Hamid.
It's been awhile.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.701
Well, I came personally to
give you to give you the chance

07:20.744 --> 07:24.182
to do the judicious thing
and turn over Brandon Page.

07:24.226 --> 07:27.403
If Mr. Callan feels like he has
a solid case against Mr. Page,

07:27.447 --> 07:30.928
I have the upmost confidence
he'll get a conviction, so--

07:30.972 --> 07:33.061
There's our star witness now.
Maddy Hernandez.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.759
- Her lawyer, Ms. Lopez.
- A 14 year old.

07:35.803 --> 07:39.241
Maddy, I'm AUSA Zoya Hamid.

07:39.284 --> 07:42.766
I don't know if Mr. Callan
or Ms. Lopez informed you,

07:42.810 --> 07:45.377
but if you testified
for the federal government,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.205
we'd be able to put you into
protective custody

07:47.249 --> 07:49.773
- right along side your sister.
- For how long?

07:50.513 --> 07:55.126
Right. Maddy, while Ms. Hamid's
proposal may seem enticing,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.868
you have no idea how much time
you would have to spend

07:57.912 --> 08:00.262
- in protective custody.
- I'm okay with that.

08:00.305 --> 08:04.005
- I'd be with my sister.
- Um-Maddy,

08:04.048 --> 08:06.921
are you willing to give up
your ice skating career?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.445
In testifying
for the state,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.926
you're able to continue
visitations with your siter,

08:11.969 --> 08:14.276
have the freedom
to keep skating,

08:14.319 --> 08:17.105
all while being
in protective custody.

08:17.148 --> 08:21.762
Gloria sacrificed so that
you would have opportunities.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.809
Are you sure you're ready
to throw all of that away?

08:25.853 --> 08:28.246
You are good at playing
hardball, Ms. Lopez.

08:28.290 --> 08:32.686
Maddy, I'm around
if you change your mind.

08:35.036 --> 08:38.822
Maddy, I promise you
not only are we going to lock up

08:38.866 --> 08:41.259
Brandon Page, but you'll
be able to be with your sister

08:41.303 --> 08:43.827
without the burden
of a protective detail, okay?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.873
Teddy, will you escort
Miss Hernandez

08:45.916 --> 08:47.918
and Ms. Lopez
to the witness room?

08:47.962 --> 08:51.052
- I'll meet you down there too.
- Yes, sir. Right this way.

09:00.191 --> 09:03.020
Really, Callan?
Meeting Collier behind my back.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.849
Wait. You've had signed
divorce papers this whole time

09:05.893 --> 09:07.459
and haven't submitted them
and I'm the bad guy?

09:07.503 --> 09:09.853
Let's just go ahead
and unravel that gut punch.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.855
Okay, I'm sorry.
But I have my reasons.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.422
What reason would
you possibly have

09:13.465 --> 09:15.555
for not wanting
to start our life together?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.426
-
- Or is that it?

09:17.469 --> 09:19.210
This, whatever this is.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.082
This is just,
it's no longer working for you.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.085
- You are so way off base.
- Then what is it?

09:25.347 --> 09:28.132
This whole time I thought
Collier was the hold out.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.699
And it's you.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.746
Wait. Wait, where are you going?
We are not done here.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.225
I have a big prelim in 802.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.793
We can cage fight
this out later.

09:40.884 --> 09:44.671
Newly minted
attorney coming through.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.411
Good morning, deputy Scott.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.936
- I passed the bar.
- Well, good morning.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.894
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.593
Oh shoot, hold please. Hey.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.595
Hey!

09:56.160 --> 09:58.728
Asshole.
I don't have time for this.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.383
Oh, come on.

10:01.426 --> 10:05.213
You know what?
It ain't gonna ruin my day.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.736
Hey.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.826
Okay. Oh!

10:11.698 --> 10:13.351
Mr. Callan,
are the people ready?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.919
- Yes, your Honor.
- Is the defense ready?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.747
Your Honor, I filed a motion
to quash and traverse

10:17.791 --> 10:19.575
the search warrant
in this matter.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.317
I'd like that motion to be heard
before the preliminary hearing.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.754
Did the people receive
a copy of the motion?

10:24.798 --> 10:26.930
Ah.
I think so, your Honor.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.540
Ill hear from you,
Mr. Armstrong.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.717
I am moving to suppress
each and every item

10:30.760 --> 10:32.762
that was seized
when the search warrant

10:32.806 --> 10:34.503
was executed
at Mr. Page's residence.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.158
The warrant contains a fatal
flaw, therefore the search

10:37.201 --> 10:39.160
was illegal and the items
were seized illegally.

10:39.203 --> 10:42.729
The name in the search warrant
that lead to the search is--

10:42.772 --> 10:44.382
- What?
- Exactly.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.647
- Mr. Callan?
- You Honor,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.823
the name on the search warrant
is Gloria Hernandez.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.781
Not her sister Maddy Hernandez.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.304
Your Honor, I can fix this.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.917
No, you cannot,
Mr. Callan.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.093
Given the error
in the search warrant,

10:59.136 --> 11:02.226
I have no choice but to grant
the motion to quash.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.186
Are the people able
to proceed without those items?

11:05.229 --> 11:06.796
- Yes, your Honor.
- Thank you, your Honor.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.233
The people can
still prove this case.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.453
But I'm requesting a continuance

11:11.496 --> 11:13.324
to prepare for the preliminary hearing

11:13.368 --> 11:15.892
- in light of the court's ruling.
- The defense objects.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.331
Mr. Armstrong,

11:20.375 --> 11:22.725
I would like to have a word
with you in my chambers.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.348
Okay.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.615
Seriously? Yeah.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.617
Thanks for letting
the elevator shut in my face.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.015
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.769
The wrong name on the warrant,
are you kidding me?

12:06.813 --> 12:09.467
Now, all the physical evidence
that was seized gets suppressed.

12:09.511 --> 12:13.123
I know, sir. It was a really,
really bad mistake.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.213
Are you working overtime to make
this office look like a joke?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.954
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't send this

12:17.998 --> 12:19.739
already screwed up
case directly to the Feds?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.175
- Sir-
- AUSA Hamid

12:21.218 --> 12:23.264
just texted offering
to send over US marshals

12:23.307 --> 12:25.570
to take Brandon Page
into federal custody.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.790
Tell me why I am not
saying yes and thank you.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.793
Sir, Andre Armstrong
is a former Federal prosecutor

12:30.837 --> 12:32.403
and an expert
on federal procedure.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.405
He could delay
this trial for years.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.973
We can put
Brandon Page away right now.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.932
I can win this
with the evidence we have.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.847
We have a solid witness
in Maddy.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.892
That is hardly reassuring.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.589
Did you--

12:44.633 --> 12:47.767
I'm only 60% convinced
she's even going to testify.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.030
You need to fix this, now.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.041
I am exceedingly, profoundly
sorry for my unforgivable error,

13:01.084 --> 13:02.782
and I am ready to tender
my immediate--

13:02.825 --> 13:04.174
No.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.004
You do not get the easy way out.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.617
Brandon Page's TikBait post?

13:12.661 --> 13:15.359
TikBait is how Brandon Page
communicates with his followers.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.840
I think he's coordinating
the smash and grab attacks.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.494
- Figure out how he's doing it.
- Wow.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.713
So, you think
there is a secret embedded code.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.933
That is so... cool.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.196
If we can connect
Page to the robberies,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.850
then we can submit
his evidence against him.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.417
On the honor
of the Biswas' family,

13:29.460 --> 13:30.940
and even the shady ones
in Minnesota,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.116
I will untangle
this gordian knot.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.467
Get out, and do not come back
until you figured it out.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.469
I will not fail you again, boss.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.341
I'm not your boss.

13:42.909 --> 13:46.913
HELP!

13:53.484 --> 13:57.010
I am not gonna...

14:19.989 --> 14:24.559
I need you to stop taking over
cases slated for my courtroom.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.649
How else am I supposed to make
a name for myself in this town?

14:27.692 --> 14:30.260
I don't know. But you need
to do it away from here.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.958
I'm just somebody
trying to do my job,

14:32.001 --> 14:33.873
as a prominent
partner of a national firm

14:33.916 --> 14:36.223
by bringing in the high end
clients like Brandon Page,

14:36.266 --> 14:38.486
to grow my Los Angeles office.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.663
I was unaware Audubon & Quinn
was now your firm.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.317
We're in discussions.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.623
But the real question,
my dear, is...

14:45.667 --> 14:47.930
why is my being in
your courtroom a problem?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.193
Because I was
under the impression

14:50.237 --> 14:52.456
you were a happily
married woman.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.463
- I most certainly am.
- Okay.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.814
Then there's nothing else
to talk about.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.319
<i>What is the matter with you?</i> <i>-Woah, it's all good, yo.</i>

15:29.363 --> 15:31.539
<i>You've been Brandoned,</i> <i>and I'm buying you</i>

15:31.582 --> 15:35.064
<i>- a brand new iPhone 13.</i>
- Ugh, this is so fake.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.762
How does this guy
have 30 million followers?

15:37.806 --> 15:40.548
My generation
is not very discerning.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.160
Thanks again for helping me out.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.946
Mmm, please.
My job is beyond intense.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.382
This is a welcome break.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.951
And how many of these West Coast
mogul posts did he do?

15:51.994 --> 15:55.519
<i>Yeah, baby, I just landed</i> <i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

15:55.563 --> 15:57.304
<i>And I am buying.</i>

15:58.044 --> 16:00.220
Wait. Sunset?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.178
When did he post his?

16:02.222 --> 16:04.354
Um, June 15th.

16:04.398 --> 16:07.618
Isn't that the same day
Fred "Seg-all" was ransacked?

16:07.662 --> 16:10.839
Segal. I don't see
anything about Melrose.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.407
That's because Fred "Seg-all"
is now on Sunset Boulevard.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.931
When did he post the one
where he bought Rodeo Drive?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.325
Um, June 23rd.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.023
The date of the attack on Gucci.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.416
Do you think
his dice roll determines

16:22.459 --> 16:24.244
the locations he attacks?

16:24.287 --> 16:27.987
He bought the Grove on July 7th.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.380
Same day Nordstrom's
at the Grove was attacked.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.165
I think we might
have cracked the code.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.644
We just need a tech
expert to corroborate.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.690
- Let's take this to Mark.
- Yes. Okay.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.606
The Feds aren't going
to let this go, Callan.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.956
And why should they,
given the incompetence

16:41.000 --> 16:42.436
that this office
has been showing.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.394
Now I've got the mayor
blowing me up

16:44.438 --> 16:46.266
because the United States
attorney is blowing him up.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.355
- Callan.
- Ms. Lopez.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.270
This case needs to be dismissed.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.402
We all know that without
the evidence found at the house,

16:52.446 --> 16:54.491
everything falls
on Maddy's testimony.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.319
The jury
will find her compelling.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.104
I know a thing
or two about Juries, Callan.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.149
And generally,
they don't put much weight

17:00.193 --> 17:02.325
on testimony of a teenager.
You know this.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.371
Do not do this to her.
She's scared out of her mind.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.329
We will protect her.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.071
My apologies for not finding
that exactly comforting.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.595
Okay, one of your witnesses
was murdered two years ago.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.510
I'm sorry,
but it is the truth.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.339
Everything has changed now.
I don't need a promise.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.341
- I need-- I need assurances.
- Ms. Lopez,

17:18.385 --> 17:20.691
you have my word
we will protect your client

17:20.735 --> 17:22.519
with every
resource of this office.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.434
What does that mean?
What exactly are you saying?

17:24.478 --> 17:27.524
A full security detail outside
the witness room at trial.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.657
Which will also protect
Miss Hernandez outside

17:29.700 --> 17:32.486
of HOJ and continue until
the conclusion of the trial.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.357
And then we can call
the sheriff to discuss

17:34.401 --> 17:36.707
the specifics of your
client's protection needs.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.493
That sounds like an assurance.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.236
Thank you.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
I will take
this back to my client.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.120
Please tell me
you have something.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.863
Keep the change.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.387
<i>This is Ness,</i> <i>leave a message.</i>

18:04.431 --> 18:06.389
-
- Ness, it's Amy again.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.217
We were supposed to meet
at the Gavel and Go.

18:08.261 --> 18:11.090
Where are you?
Meet me on the first floor.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.101
- Which floor?
- First, thanks.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.780
Your Honor,
the defense is ready to proceed

18:49.824 --> 18:52.653
with preliminary hearing
and object to any continuance.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.003
I would also like
to be heard regarding bail.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.657
Your honor, a 1275 hold

18:56.700 --> 18:58.441
was placed on the defendant
at arraignment.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.530
So, the defendant cannot
bail out, unless the court

19:00.574 --> 19:03.142
conducts a hearing that
the money to be used for bail

19:03.185 --> 19:05.840
was not generated by
the commission of a felony.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.146
Mr. Armstrong?

19:07.189 --> 19:08.843
I request
that the hold be lifted.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.151
Mr. Callan is correct.
You need to file a formal motion

19:12.194 --> 19:15.284
if you would like request the
hold on your client be lifted.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.504
Wait,
what just happened?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.288
Minor bump, don't worry.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.987
- And don't talk.
- You work for me, bro.

19:24.119 --> 19:28.167
You Honor, I really
don't think it's a good idea

19:28.210 --> 19:29.603
- to keep me in jail.
-

19:29.646 --> 19:33.172
Why is it not a good idea,
Mr. Armstrong?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.738
Your Honor, he didn't mean to--

19:34.782 --> 19:36.349
Let's just say
that the Brandon Nation

19:36.392 --> 19:38.742
is very loyal and protective.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.441
And I don't know
how they will react

19:41.484 --> 19:43.530
to your uncool treatment of me.

19:58.371 --> 20:03.767
I do not take kindly to threats,
Mr. Page.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.205
Council if I hear
your client speak again

20:06.248 --> 20:09.860
in such a manner, he will
be removed from my courtroom.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.907
And the preliminary hearing
will occur in his absence.

20:12.950 --> 20:16.519
- Are we clear?
- Yes, your Honor. Crystal.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.567
People, I'm denying your request
for a continuance

20:20.610 --> 20:23.265
you announced already.
Please call your first witness.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.280
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.292
Man: Ms. Byrd,
you're a social media expert.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.381
How do you think Brandon Page
was able to communicate

20:52.425 --> 20:54.601
to his followers
using a board game?

20:54.644 --> 20:56.777
The roll of the dice
was the designated time.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.300
The neighborhood he landed on

20:58.344 --> 20:59.780
indicated
the location for the hit.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.782
Thank you.
No further questions.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.175
Mr. Armstrong.
Your witness.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.614
Miss Bird,
isn't this simply Shakespeare?

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

21:09.224 --> 21:11.705
Sustained. Mr. Armstrong,
is there a question,

21:11.748 --> 21:13.402
or are you simply grandstanding?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.186
I'm making a point, Your Honor.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.667
Everyone that reads Hamlet
has a different interpretation.

21:17.711 --> 21:20.409
Rephrase the question,
Mr. Armstrong.

21:20.453 --> 21:24.674
Miss Byrd, how did you
come to this conclusion?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.937
By reviewing Brandon Page's
TikBait videos.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.462
And in any of these videos,
did my client ever mention

21:29.505 --> 21:32.595
the words smash,
rob or steal?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.597
- No.
- How about destroy,

21:34.641 --> 21:38.166
loot, break in,
hold up, pilfer?

21:38.645 --> 21:40.342
- No.
- Then isn't this merely

21:40.386 --> 21:43.519
your misinterpretation of my
client playing an innocent game?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.656
- No, sir.
- No further questions.

21:51.527 --> 21:54.400
- People, any redirect?
- Yes, Your Honor.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.446
Miss Byrd,
why do you believe

21:57.490 --> 22:00.362
that Brandon Page was sending
these videos to his followers?

22:00.406 --> 22:02.495
Because every video he recorded
mentioned the place

22:02.538 --> 22:04.975
that was later hit
by the smash-and-grab mob.

22:05.019 --> 22:08.283
Exhibit 1,
previously marked People's 2.

22:08.979 --> 22:11.330
What conclusions
were you able to make?

22:11.373 --> 22:13.375
On January 8th at 6:00 p.m.,

22:13.419 --> 22:14.637
Bespoke men store
on Melrose Avenue

22:14.681 --> 22:16.770
was hit by a group of 60 teens.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.380
Three hours before that hit,

22:18.424 --> 22:20.208
Brandon Page
recorded this message.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.820
<i>Yeah. All right.</i> <i>Number six in Melrose Avenue.</i>

22:23.864 --> 22:26.170
<i>One LA's Best.</i> <i>Your challenge?</i>

22:26.214 --> 22:28.999
<i>Discovering for yourself.</i> <i>We need a reason?</i>

22:29.043 --> 22:33.221
<i>Two words, hot chick.</i> <i>As in pizza at Lucifer's.</i>

22:33.264 --> 22:35.963
<i>You need clothes?</i> <i>Be crushed on bespoke.</i>

22:36.006 --> 22:37.834
<i>You wanna hang with celebs,</i> <i>go to Craigs.</i>

22:37.878 --> 22:40.663
<i>Need I say more?</i> <i>I think not.</i>

22:40.707 --> 22:43.536
<i>Get out there, Tribe.</i> <i>Make me proud.</i>

22:44.580 --> 22:46.365
"“Be crushed on bespoke."”

22:46.887 --> 22:50.020
This past year has seen 11
smash-and-grab robberies.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.675
Over $400,000
in stolen merchandise.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.852
And for every robbery,
there is a TiKBait video

22:55.896 --> 22:59.029
from Mr. Page that coincides
with the exact location

22:59.073 --> 23:01.597
of the robbery,,
as well as him mentioning

23:01.641 --> 23:03.425
the store that was later robbed.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.819
Thank you.
No further questions.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.256
<i>It's all fiction, man.</i>

23:08.299 --> 23:10.301
<i>The powers</i> <i>are twisting my words, Tribe.</i>

23:10.345 --> 23:13.043
<i>Making up stories.</i> <i>Trying to use an innocent.</i>

23:13.087 --> 23:15.002
<i>Someone I trusted</i> <i>and let into my home</i>

23:15.045 --> 23:17.961
<i>I thought was family.</i> <i>Can't. Won't happen.</i>

23:18.005 --> 23:22.531
<i>Judas must not betray.</i> <i>Justice will prevail.</i>

23:22.575 --> 23:24.446
- I gotta get out of here.
- What? Why?

23:24.490 --> 23:26.753
Honey,
he's just talking, honey.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.450
It's just a video.
He can't get to you.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.626
Can you hear him?
He just threatened me.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.107
You know? Look.

23:37.546 --> 23:40.767
Hi.
You see, we're protected.

23:41.724 --> 23:45.206
We're all good.
And Brandon Page is in custody.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.903
He can't do anything.

23:47.687 --> 23:49.776
It's not him I'm worried about.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.952
It's Leo.
He's coming for me,

23:51.995 --> 23:55.521
- and I know it.
- Maddy... It's gonna be okay.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.480
Okay? It's going to be okay.
I promise.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.225
I can't believe Mark wouldn't
allow me to sit second chair?

24:04.268 --> 24:07.097
Look, we broke the code and got
Mark the evidence he needed.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.273
- He'll be fine.
- Oh, you're right.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.753
We basically saved the day.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.060
I should have figured
everything out sooner.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.931
God, Teddy!

24:14.975 --> 24:17.194
- You think Mark will forgive me?
- No, Teddy.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.501
I don't think Mark
will ever forgive you.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.937
I don't like
when you joke about that.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.591
-
- Oh, dang.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.245
Another video
TikBait just posted.

24:24.288 --> 24:25.986
Who's posting?
Brandon's in custody?

24:26.029 --> 24:28.510
Leo Sikes. <i>-Our boy Brandon is in trouble.</i>

24:28.554 --> 24:30.469
<i>He's being set up.</i> <i>All lies.</i>

24:30.512 --> 24:33.341
<i>We gotta make this go away.</i> <i>Time to fight like hell.</i>

24:33.384 --> 24:36.213
- He's telling them to attack.
- What? That's ridiculous.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.477
"“Time to fight like hell."”
What else could he mean?

24:38.520 --> 24:41.131
Look, we're in a courthouse.
There are deputies everywhere.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.482
- It would be suicide.
- I gotta warn Mark.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.136
<i>Mark Callen,</i> <i>please leave a message.</i>

24:46.180 --> 24:48.791
Damnit! Voicemail.
I'll do it in person.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.664
What? Teddy.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.928
You forgot your badge.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.848
-
- Put your bag down.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.502
Step over here, man.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.981
- Stop.
- Now, now, now.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.983
No crowding!
Stop.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.217
You must stop!

25:27.874 --> 25:30.311
I think Mark should
be calling any minute.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.357
After you testify,
the deputies will get you

25:33.401 --> 25:35.577
out of here and into
a temporary safe house.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.187
How long before
I can see my sister?

25:37.231 --> 25:41.017
I don't know exactly,
but the D.A. promised

25:41.061 --> 25:42.671
to work something out
with the feds.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.284
What happens if I don't testify?

25:47.328 --> 25:50.766
Your testimony
can put Brandon Page away.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.464
And if not,
he's gonna keep doing this,

25:53.508 --> 25:55.292
and more people could get hurt.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.947
I know too much.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.603
I know about the robberies,
the TikBait code.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.605
-
- What was that?

26:03.649 --> 26:04.998
I don't know.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.695
Lock this door.
Don't let anyone in.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.610
What's going on?
What's going on?

26:14.921 --> 26:18.054
- Uh, Luke, what's happening?
- We're on lockdown.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.100
The building's being overrun
by a bunch of teens.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.972
- It's Sykes. I told you.
- No. You don't know that.

26:23.016 --> 26:25.584
- Is she referring to Leo Sykes?
- Yeah.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.368
She thinks
that he's coming for her.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.197
What should I do? <i>-I'm on my way.</i>

26:30.240 --> 26:32.939
-
- Stop. You can't go that way.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.810
Go back to your offices
and stay there.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.377
No, no.
We gotta get to courtroom 802.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.640
The person responsible
for all this is in there.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.990
Hey, get off of there.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.253
Teddy!

26:50.130 --> 26:52.611
Oh, my God. Ness?
Oh, my God.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.135
Oh, God.
Ness, can you hear me?

26:55.178 --> 26:58.965
- Ness!
- Amy... I passed the bar.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.924
Oh, my God.
Okay. Okay.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.752
Um, I'm going
to get you help, okay?

27:03.796 --> 27:07.277
Just...
just stay with me, Ness, okay?

27:07.321 --> 27:09.149
Okay! Oh, my God.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.107
Mr. Callen, are you ready
to call your next witness?

27:11.151 --> 27:12.935
I am, Your Honor.
The People would like to call

27:12.979 --> 27:14.981
Maddy Hernandez to the stand.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.939
<i>We're on lockdown.</i> <i>Get everyone to safety, now.</i>

27:16.983 --> 27:18.941
Your Honor, I need
to get you to your chambers.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.682
- Why? What's happening?
- No time. Please your Honor.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.119
- In your chambers, please.
- What about everyone else?

27:23.163 --> 27:24.947
You get in the gallery.

27:24.991 --> 27:28.124
Mr. Callen.
Mr. Armstrong, this way.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.003
Which part of the DA's office
not being able

28:21.047 --> 28:22.875
to handle this case
didn't they understand?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.964
- Federal agents.
- Glad you're here to assist.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.487
If by assist you mean
resolve a situation

28:26.530 --> 28:28.054
that could have been
prevented, then, yes.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.316
Who's responsible
for this little party?

28:29.359 --> 28:30.970
Not sure.
A gang of teenagers

28:31.013 --> 28:32.449
rushed the entrance,
tossing smoke bombs,

28:32.493 --> 28:33.668
causing an uproar.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.843
Any of the suspects armed?

28:34.887 --> 28:36.192
We're still sorting it out,

28:36.236 --> 28:38.020
but deputies
are taking the necessary

28:38.064 --> 28:40.283
precautions not to cause
a teenage bloodbath in there.

28:40.327 --> 28:44.244
Sheriff Diaz,
my wife is a judge in there.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.288
What's your plan?

28:45.332 --> 28:47.029
<i>Requesting confirmation.</i>

28:47.073 --> 28:48.509
<i>How many bleeding</i> <i>and wounded victims?</i>

28:48.552 --> 28:50.467
<i>Please confirm. Over.</i>

28:53.427 --> 28:54.994
Thank you.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.043
I can't believe
this is happening,

29:01.087 --> 29:03.132
but I shouldn't be surprised.

29:03.176 --> 29:07.571
Every time you are in
my courtroom chaos ensues.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.008
But that's who you are.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.271
It is who you have always been.

29:11.314 --> 29:15.579
Always putting your own selfish
ambition above everything else.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.494
Why don't you just
say how you really feel,

29:17.538 --> 29:18.800
Lola Carmichael?

29:18.844 --> 29:20.584
Don'’t '‘Lola Carmichael'’ me!

29:20.628 --> 29:22.891
You are not
the man I knew 20 years ago.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.851
Because that man
that I knew had integrity.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.244
Oh, you'’re right about that.
I'm not the same man you knew

29:28.288 --> 29:31.247
because the man I am now would
never let you out of his life.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.858
No.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.424
You don't get
to rewrite history.

29:34.468 --> 29:35.599
Not today.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.818
I just didn't know if I would

29:36.862 --> 29:38.559
be enough for you back then.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.995
How could you even say that?

29:40.039 --> 29:42.258
- I tried to make it work.
- Think about it.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.956
If I had been
enough for you,

29:43.999 --> 29:45.784
you wouldn't have left
me in the first place.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.916
You ended it! You did!

29:47.960 --> 29:50.614
You decided that your
path was the only path--

29:50.658 --> 29:51.790
That was you.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.835
-And you never looked back.

29:55.097 --> 29:59.623
Do you even
understand how much you hurt me?

29:59.667 --> 30:04.803
I loved you... and that
should have been enough.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.070
I loved you, too.

30:13.159 --> 30:16.815
Damn! You're right.
Uh, you're right.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.381
I'm sorry.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.820
And I will forever regret that.

30:24.518 --> 30:27.129
Well, it'’s 20
years too late for that.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.697
Come on! Is it?

30:30.437 --> 30:34.049
Because not even you can
deny what's been happening.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.748
Just checking in
on you Judge Carmichael.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.196
Hurry up. Move.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.459
Get out, go.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.679
Ah...

31:04.340 --> 31:08.083
Okay, that should
slow the bleeding, okay?

31:08.692 --> 31:10.607
What's taking so long?

31:11.739 --> 31:16.309
Hey, you passed
the bar, and-- and I plan

31:16.352 --> 31:19.878
on putting a shit ton
of cases on your desk, okay?

31:19.921 --> 31:23.620
Ness?

31:25.144 --> 31:27.015
Okay. Okay.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.544
Are you sure
we're all safe in here?

31:34.588 --> 31:36.372
Mob seemed pretty
angry about something.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.244
Everything's going to be okay.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.376
The authorities have
everything under control, okay?

31:40.420 --> 31:42.901
It really shouldn't
be much longer before--

31:42.944 --> 31:45.904
-
- Hey, where are you?

31:45.947 --> 31:48.036
Are you safe? <i>-I'm fine.</i>

31:48.080 --> 31:49.864
<i>But, Ness,</i> <i>I think she was stabbed.</i>

31:49.908 --> 31:51.605
It's really bad.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.999
I found her in the stairwell,
she's losing a lot of blood.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.304
Amy, tell me where you are.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.740
Down the stairwell.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.612
I think between
seventh and eighth floor.

31:58.655 --> 31:59.918
Okay, I'm heading over.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.050
No one leaves this area. Back.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.922
Back.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.576
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.105
Sykes.

32:13.714 --> 32:14.976
What the--

32:25.813 --> 32:28.598
<i>You'’ve reached</i> <i>Robin Taylor, please leave--</i>

32:31.775 --> 32:33.603
<i>You'’ve reached</i> <i>Robyn Taylor--</i>

32:33.647 --> 32:36.432
Lo,
why don't you take a breath,

32:36.476 --> 32:39.261
put away the phone
and work on keeping calm?

32:39.305 --> 32:42.482
I can't just continue
to sit here and do nothing.

32:42.525 --> 32:45.311
How about I poke my head
in on some of the other judges.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.878
Stay in the chambers,
lock the deadbolts.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.271
You heard the man.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.230
I'm just checking
in on the other judges.

32:57.279 --> 33:00.413
This is a very bad idea, Teddy.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.502
I'm a knight!
I'm a knight of the court!

33:02.545 --> 33:04.634
May my sword be heavy
and my shield raised high--

33:04.678 --> 33:06.288
What are you saying?

33:06.332 --> 33:08.029
Whenever I get scared,
I recite knights honor code

33:08.073 --> 33:09.813
from Dungeons and Warlocks.

33:09.857 --> 33:12.381
Lets me channel my bravery
then I become less fearful.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.296
Okay, well, that is so great.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.516
But can you recite
on your way back to the--

33:20.041 --> 33:23.001
Sara! Sara! Sara!

33:23.044 --> 33:25.003
Sara!

33:33.141 --> 33:34.925
Hey, Maddy.

33:35.361 --> 33:38.581
We are in the safest
part of the HOJ, okay?

33:38.625 --> 33:40.931
And we've got two
armed sheriff deputies

33:40.975 --> 33:42.498
right outside that door.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.284
We're going to be out
of here in no time, okay?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.503
Yeah. Okay.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.508
You can open up, we're
going to get you to safety.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.294
See?

34:01.126 --> 34:02.562
- Hello Maddy.
- No, no, no.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.955
- Maddy, let's go.
- No, no, no, no.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.175
- Now.
- Wait, please, please!

34:07.219 --> 34:10.091
Drop the gun now!
Sykes, drop the gun.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.311
Drop the gun now Sykes.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.139
I said drop the gun!

34:15.531 --> 34:16.445
Now!

34:16.489 --> 34:18.099
-

34:20.623 --> 34:21.755
Don't move.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.539
Stay down.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.888
Oh, my God!

34:26.238 --> 34:27.543
Oh, God.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.806
Stop, stop. It'’s all right baby.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.593
Help!

34:36.378 --> 34:38.293
You wrote
defamation for the claim.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.948
What did you write
for potential damages?

34:41.905 --> 34:43.951
Come on, that'’s
essay question two.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.431
Don't leave me hanging.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.129
Ness-- Okay.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.739
In all standard defamation cases

34:49.783 --> 34:52.438
the potential
for damages start--

34:53.743 --> 34:54.788
Amy?

34:54.831 --> 34:55.963
Oh, thank God.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.138
Please help me get her up.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.487
Slow down. Are you okay?

34:58.531 --> 35:00.359
I'm fine, but she
needs medical attention.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.404
Should we be moving her?

35:02.448 --> 35:04.537
She was just talking a second
ago but then she stopped.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.973
- Mark, we have to help her.
- Okay.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.279
All right.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.327
I can give you our
exact location in the building.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.242
Em, I'm good.
It's just a flesh wound.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.765
No, it's a through and through, Luke.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.767
You need to go to the hospital.
Stay down.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.073
Don't fucking move.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.119
Maddy, you're doing great. Okay?

35:21.162 --> 35:23.208
<i>Ma'am, can you</i> <i>tell us where you are located?</i>

35:23.251 --> 35:24.600
Yes. Uh, witness room eight.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.036
Left wing,
just past the stairway,

35:26.080 --> 35:27.516
third door on the right.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.691
<i>Thank you.</i> <i>They're on their way.</i>

35:28.735 --> 35:30.563
Okay. Thank you. Please hurry.

35:30.606 --> 35:31.781
Please.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.353
Go! Here come
the cops, run!

35:44.229 --> 35:46.318
Freeze!
Put your hands up.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.843
Up against the wall.
You, up against the wall!

36:02.856 --> 36:05.641
- Just stay behind me.
- Like hell.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.955
All clear Your Honor.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.043
Everyone all right here?

36:16.086 --> 36:17.175
Any injuries?

36:17.218 --> 36:18.654
All good here, bailiff.

36:18.698 --> 36:19.916
Thank you.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.356
- Hey.
- Oh!

36:24.399 --> 36:26.358
I'm okay, I'm okay.

36:29.752 --> 36:30.971
Oh, thank God.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.366
Thank you. Thank you.

36:34.409 --> 36:36.629
I got it, baby. I got it.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.458
I got it, okay? It's over.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.417
You did so good.
You were so brave. It's over.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.680
Mr. Sykes, we have
been looking for you.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.509
Okay?

36:47.553 --> 36:49.294
Stay with me. Stay with me.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.296
- Mm.
- Okay?

36:53.385 --> 36:54.995
Thank you.

36:55.038 --> 36:57.258
Listen, Luke, you're
going to go to the hospital.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.217
I will be
there every step of the way.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.522
- Okay?
- Em.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.089
Don'’t worry about me. I'm fine.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.873
I am fine.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.397
I love you, Em.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.749
I love you, too Watkins.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.709
You'’ll be fine, okay?

37:16.930 --> 37:19.062
It's all right. They're getting
her to the hospital now.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.239
- I'm gonna go with her.
- All right. I'll meet you there.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.590
- Okay.
- Amy, I love you.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.723
I love you.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.295
Hey. Have you seen--

37:34.339 --> 37:36.341
Lola? Uh, she should be
in her chambers.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.168
All right. Thank you. Thank you.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.692
I'm going to find my wife.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.751
Man! I knew you were an idiot,
but trying to bust out

37:55.795 --> 37:58.363
of the courthouse and going
after our star witness,

37:58.406 --> 37:59.842
that'’s a whole new level
of stupid.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.496
Look, I'm just as surprised
as you are,

38:01.540 --> 38:03.150
Mr. Callan,
it really makes a guy

38:03.193 --> 38:04.847
lose faith in the system,
if I'm being honest.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.588
- That's being honest?
- Yeah.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.242
Lucky for me,
I've got a good lawyer.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.157
Thousand dollar suits
get you country club deals,

38:10.200 --> 38:11.593
am I right?

38:11.637 --> 38:13.116
Unfortunately,
you're probably right.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.466
You played a good game.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.163
Try not to beat yourself up.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.426
That's why we're not
trying you in the state courts.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.341
I'm gonna hand you over to my
new friends

38:20.385 --> 38:22.082
in the federal department.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.998
You've got nothing on me.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.696
You think empty
threats are gonna make me talk?

38:27.740 --> 38:30.177
It's amazing how motivated
people are to talk

38:30.220 --> 38:32.484
when they've got a bullet
lodged in their shoulder.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.400
You attacked
a courthouse, Brandon.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.358
That'll land
you in a federal supermax

38:37.402 --> 38:38.794
where you can
spend the rest of

38:38.838 --> 38:41.014
your natural life
in solitary confinement.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.364
That's if you're lucky.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.453
You got outplayed, buddy.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.976
Try not to beat yourself up.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.500
