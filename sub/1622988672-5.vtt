WEBVTT

00:49.299 --> 00:50.133
Peyton got it.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.886
Peyton got it?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.430
I don't believe it.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.267
Why does everyone care
so much about Peyton?

00:58.350 --> 01:01.103
You should meet with Dean Chang.
Make her give you some answers.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.981
-Seriously, let's schedule an appointment.
-Why? What's she gonna say?

01:04.063 --> 01:06.900
Anyway, I'm fine.
I didn't become a surgeon for fellowships.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.278
I did it because I wanted to help people
without having to talk to them.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.031
Just ask her what happened so
you'll know you did everything you could.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.033
-I mean, Peyton?
-Please stop.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.077
Okay.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.371
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.582
It's just a doggy-dog world.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.588
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's a "doggy-dog" world?

01:27.671 --> 01:31.008
No, when a fellowship
that should so clearly go to you,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.968
-goes to someone--
-Hold on. Hold on.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.303
Doggy-dog?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.514
Oh, Mel.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.142
You just put me
in a really difficult position

01:40.225 --> 01:43.312
because I need you
to keep saying "doggy-dog,"

01:43.395 --> 01:48.108
but it's my obligation to tell you
that the expression is "dog-eat-dog."

01:48.817 --> 01:51.278
I don't think so. It's doggy-dog.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.530
You're doubling down?

01:53.614 --> 01:58.952
Dog-eat-dog doesn't make sense.
Dogs don't eat dogs. That never happens.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.913
Then what does "doggy-dog" mean?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.581
It means, like, it's a rough world.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.834
You can be brought down so low,
a dog would have you for a pet.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.794
You'd be doggy to a dog.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.130
Okay. A question comes to mind.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.216
Is English your first language?

02:12.716 --> 02:14.051
-Okay, babe.
-No, I'm sorry.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.803
Listen, I love you. It's okay to be wrong.

02:16.887 --> 02:17.888
Well, I'm not wrong.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.224
And I was just trying
to make you feel better.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.725
You did.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.987
I'm sorry about today.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.159
You were right about doggy-dog.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.286
Makes a lot of sense.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.288
Thank you, sweetie.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.999
And I'm sorry about the fellowship.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.084
Thank you.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.463
And you, you wouldn't eat another dog,
would you?

02:51.547 --> 02:54.216
No, you wouldn't. You would never.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.469
But you would have your own dog
for a pet, wouldn't you?

02:57.553 --> 02:59.096
Yes, you would.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.390
Look at that. He agrees with me.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.403
Melissa, my word, you're disrobing.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.697
No-- Oh, no, just my shoes. It's late.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.283
What a breath of fresh air you are.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.995
How do you think of these things?
You're such a free spirit.

03:23.787 --> 03:24.997
That's me.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.708
Okay, well, here we go.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.129
Piggies, we are giving ourselves
to nature.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.510
Shall we be tender monkeys?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.890
You're a little different in love.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.436
But you know what?
I'm into it because I'm not controlling.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.689
How about instead
we go over our top threes of the day?

03:50.772 --> 03:54.026
By which I mean
the day's three worst moments.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.695
Seems you have turned
my world on its head.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.780
Jorge, you don't have to do that.

03:58.864 --> 04:02.075
It's just a dumb thing
I used to do with an old boyfriend,

04:02.159 --> 04:03.702
and I shouldn't have mentioned it.

04:03.785 --> 04:08.040
Okay, but my number one is when
Helen Pritt gave me the stink eye

04:08.123 --> 04:10.000
for using the word "constipated."

04:10.667 --> 04:14.254
Oh, how positively savage. "Constipated."

04:16.673 --> 04:17.925
What was your number one?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.303
Oh, my number one of the day...

04:21.386 --> 04:23.680
well, it was me. I was a horrible doctor.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.475
Oh, no. Although--

04:26.558 --> 04:29.228
Maybe you could prescribe
less radium water, but--

04:29.311 --> 04:32.481
I was distracted all day because
my thoughts were only of you, darling.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.818
How you crack me open
and let the light flood in.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.908
It's crazy, but I feel like
you've done the same for me.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.869
Seems like forever
since I've been this happy.

04:49.957 --> 04:54.962
Suddenly you've got my senses reeling

04:55.963 --> 05:01.176
Is it just the thrill of something new?

05:01.718 --> 05:06.807
Suddenly these feelings that I'm feeling

05:07.599 --> 05:12.312
If they're real, then what am I to do?

05:13.897 --> 05:19.570
There's no sense
In trying to explain it

05:20.153 --> 05:26.326
What and where and why
And when and how

05:26.410 --> 05:32.749
All I know is suddenly I love you

05:33.333 --> 05:39.214
And suddenly that's all that matters

05:39.840 --> 05:42.926
Now

05:55.772 --> 05:56.982
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.193
It's my fault, I'm sure.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.697
Oh, looky everyone.
The countess has returned early.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.781
How wonderful!

06:04.865 --> 06:07.868
Melissa, this is
the Countess Gabriele Von Blerkom.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.663
-She also invented stainless steel.
-Jorge, please.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.459
I dabble in aluminothermic
reduction processes and I got lucky.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.963
Oh, my gosh.
This is just like Sound of Music.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.257
Let me guess,
you're just back from the city

06:22.341 --> 06:24.384
and you're supposed to marry him, right?

06:25.135 --> 06:29.014
Have we met? 'Cause I'd never forget
such a lovely creature.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.266
What a beautiful couple you two make.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.478
Blerky, Blerky. You silly, silly, Blerky.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.022
No, no. Do you think
this woman and I were dancing?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.024
No, I was just simply spinning her around

06:39.107 --> 06:41.860
to dislodge the food
that she was choking--

06:41.944 --> 06:43.320
I'm Melissa, the new nurse.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.656
Although you look much newer, Blerky,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.534
you shine and sparkle so!

06:48.617 --> 06:51.745
Jorge, I'm parched.
Do root out some champagne.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.038
Yes, of course.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.043
He's in love with you.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.171
Well, he'd hardly be a man if he weren't.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.633
Oh-- Stop it. No. I mean, I guess.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.177
You are a goddess.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.721
You're so smart and stunning.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.391
Compared to you, I'm a barefoot mess.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.687
What fun.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.147
Let's just go find your shoes, shall we?

07:19.231 --> 07:23.485
The truth is, it's crazy,
but Jorge and I are in love.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.028
And I know that must hurt,

07:25.112 --> 07:30.576
but I have this feeling,
a vision let's call it,

07:30.659 --> 07:33.370
that you are going
to graciously step aside.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.249
I can't explain how I know.
Let's call it a sixth sense.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.502
Oh, there are so many things
one could call it.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.299
What sweaty little hands you have.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.469
You and I must
get to know each other better.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.848
Oh, I know.
We'll go for a drive. Tomorrow?

07:52.931 --> 07:55.017
I would love that, Blerky.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.021
You feel comfortable enough
to call me that.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.359
It's raisin bread.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.195
-Yeah.
-It's coleslaw.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.655
Sarsaparilla soda?

08:11.241 --> 08:15.120
My sister must really like you.
She's never smiled like this before.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.748
Everyone in town thinks she's a sad sack.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.041
Carson.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.252
Why don't you go count the ants
over by that pine tree?

08:22.336 --> 08:23.587
Absolutely.

08:24.671 --> 08:29.426
Well, whatever everyone in town thinks,
it's better than what I think of them.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.594
Smiling is overrated.

08:31.762 --> 08:32.971
Twenty-six ants!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.847
Keep counting, buddy!

08:36.558 --> 08:40.312
So, how long are you going
to be in Schmigadoon?

08:40.395 --> 08:44.483
I ask because I've had difficulties
navigating the ins and outs

08:44.566 --> 08:46.068
of handyman season before.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.362
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.405
I really need to get back to New York.

08:50.489 --> 08:53.033
But you can't. I mean, it isn't safe.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.494
It's filled with gambling and crime

08:55.577 --> 08:58.539
and poor souls who've tried to make it big

08:58.622 --> 09:01.333
but can't go back home
because of foolish pride.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.669
See, but that's what I love
about New York.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.631
There are so many people
in the city from all walks of life.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.384
I don't know, maybe it's just because
you can't keep track of them all,

09:10.467 --> 09:14.388
but-- but everyone in New York's
got the chance to reinvent themselves.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.899
My sister kissed Dr. Skinner! My sister!

09:25.983 --> 09:28.402
Carson, you know better than to spy.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.153
That will be sentences when we get home.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.615
Sentences? Then I'm never telling you
how many ants there are.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.244
He thinks everyone's
got to know everyone's business.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.372
It's all right.
Maybe he'll grow up to be a reporter.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.582
I can see that headline.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.918
"Emma Kisses Dr. Skinner:
Schoolmarm Scandal."

09:46.837 --> 09:49.631
No, it's okay. He knows he has a lisp.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.885
I had one too.
We don't pretend that it doesn't exist.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.597
You know what?
You are doing a great job with him.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.100
It can't be easy
being both a sister and a parent.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.061
That's really none of your business.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.647
What? I'm sorry.
I meant that as a compliment.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.024
Well, thank you for that.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.776
Oh, dear. It looks like rain.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.070
-It's clear.
-Well, that's the pattern, isn't it?

10:12.154 --> 10:14.406
No rain. Rain. No rain. Rain.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.492
Oh, it's been so nice seeing you, Josh,

10:17.576 --> 10:20.037
but Carson and I really need
to be on our way.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.622
Wait. Emma, what's wrong?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.123
Carson, it's time to go.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.417
-But Dr. Skinner was--
-No, we need to go.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.339
Wha--

10:31.256 --> 10:32.257
Emma.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.524
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Layton.
-Is it?

10:49.233 --> 10:50.317
Pardon?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.986
Oh, sir, I hear you. Yes, I hear you.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.989
And normally I'd agree that, yes,
it is a good afternoon.

10:56.073 --> 11:00.285
But not this afternoon.
Not with the state of our town today.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.664
We've got tribulation, my good sir

11:03.747 --> 11:05.916
We've got tribulation in Schmigadoon

11:05.999 --> 11:09.837
Look down there, do you see what I see?
Peanut shells in the street

11:09.920 --> 11:12.464
Lying there like passed-out drunks
In the gutter

11:12.548 --> 11:15.092
Turning town square
Into the floor of a saloon

11:15.175 --> 11:17.302
The home of loose woman
And hooch-happy sinners

11:17.386 --> 11:19.429
A petting pantry
In the middle of the street

11:19.513 --> 11:21.181
Is that what our town's become?

11:21.265 --> 11:23.100
Is that the future
We want for our children?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.852
I'm telling ya things have changed

11:24.935 --> 11:26.979
Ever since those two outsiders waltzed in

11:27.604 --> 11:30.023
With their big city ways
And their newfangled ideas

11:30.107 --> 11:32.150
Promiscuity and depravity

11:32.776 --> 11:34.695
Interlopers interloping

11:34.778 --> 11:36.780
With hearts colder than the hinges of hell

11:36.864 --> 11:38.615
First the two of them arrived unmarried

11:38.699 --> 11:41.076
Brimming with lust
Wanting to share a bed

11:41.159 --> 11:43.287
Then the brazen display
At the basket auction

11:43.370 --> 11:45.539
Now the mayor's out
Proclaiming his perversions

11:45.622 --> 11:47.374
At the root of it all are two strangers

11:47.457 --> 11:49.751
Who've never cracked a Bible in their life

11:49.835 --> 11:53.130
And that's gonna lead
To tribulation and strife

11:53.213 --> 11:55.549
Now I've got nothing against outsiders

11:56.091 --> 11:58.177
Provided they're the right kind of people

11:58.260 --> 12:00.888
Kind of folk who look and talk
And act like us

12:00.971 --> 12:03.015
Like peas in a pod
And birds of a feather

12:03.098 --> 12:05.350
Not loudmouthed trash
With their tommyrot, flapdoodle

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
Claptrap, fiddle-faddle, jiggery-pokery

12:07.686 --> 12:09.897
Stirring up the cream
While we're waiting for it to settle

12:09.980 --> 12:11.982
Like vermin in the root cellar
Flies in the buttermilk

12:12.065 --> 12:13.984
And they're influencing
There, I said it

12:14.067 --> 12:16.028
They're influencing your children

12:16.111 --> 12:18.322
Like an earwig crawling
From their ears to their brains

12:18.405 --> 12:20.616
And soon your young 'uns
Will be neglecting chores

12:20.699 --> 12:22.910
Milk going sour
Unstrained in the springhouse

12:22.993 --> 12:25.037
Back talk at dinner
No time for the good book

12:25.120 --> 12:27.456
Ragtime blaring on the Victrola

12:27.539 --> 12:29.166
And that's just the beginning, folks

12:29.249 --> 12:30.834
Soon you won't even, no you won't

12:30.918 --> 12:33.003
No, you won't even recognize your own town

12:33.086 --> 12:36.006
I'm talking 'bout neon signs
Smoke-filled rooms

12:36.089 --> 12:38.217
Billiard parlors and painted ladies

12:38.300 --> 12:40.302
Wanton women having children
Out of wedlock

12:40.385 --> 12:42.429
Rowdy men using filthy language

12:42.513 --> 12:44.723
The devil himself dancing
On your front porch

12:44.806 --> 12:46.808
Stealing your babies
Out of their cribs at midnight

12:46.892 --> 12:48.977
Cows and sheep having amorous congress

12:49.061 --> 12:51.230
Children with the mark of the beast
On their foreheads

12:51.313 --> 12:55.275
All thanks to these two out-of-towners
Dr. Skinner and Miss Gimble

12:55.359 --> 12:59.696
Better hold on to your husband
Best keep an eye on your wife

12:59.780 --> 13:03.450
There's gonna be
Some tribulation and strife

13:03.534 --> 13:05.619
-Oh, we've got strife
-Got strife

13:05.702 --> 13:08.455
-And tribulation
-Tribulation

13:08.539 --> 13:12.292
-And not to mention miscegenation
-That sounds bad

13:12.376 --> 13:14.419
-Let's pray the Lord
-Pray the Lord

13:14.503 --> 13:16.672
-Will save us soon
-Save us soon

13:16.755 --> 13:20.133
'Cause we've got strife
And tribulation in Schmigadoon!

13:20.217 --> 13:22.010
Strife, strife, strife, strife

13:22.094 --> 13:23.387
Strife, strife, strife

13:23.470 --> 13:24.555
I can't hear y'all!

13:24.638 --> 13:26.265
Strife, strife, strife

13:27.683 --> 13:29.226
I love this town.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.354
Y'all know my great-great-granddaddy
founded Schmigadoon

13:32.437 --> 13:35.524
when he came upon this
beautiful tract of land and said,

13:35.607 --> 13:37.317
"They'll never find us here."

13:37.401 --> 13:39.486
But it pains me. It pains me

13:39.570 --> 13:42.656
to see our town slipping away
right before our very eyes.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.158
I tried to alert the mayor,
but his mind was elsewhere.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.368
In his pants!

13:46.994 --> 13:49.538
His poor wife is so ashamed
she locked herself inside her house.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.039
And this time, on purpose.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.374
I'm sorry, Florence!

13:53.000 --> 13:57.129
New leadership.
That's what Schmigadoon needs.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.672
But who?

13:58.755 --> 14:02.467
Who has the moral wherewithal,
the traditional how-to,

14:02.551 --> 14:06.513
the good, old-fashioned,
all-American je ne sais quoi

14:06.597 --> 14:08.390
to stand up to these two outsiders?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.934
-Mildred Layton for mayor!
-I couldn't.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.145
-Mildred Layton for mayor!
-I wouldn't.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.398
-Mildred Layton for mayor!
-Mildred Layton for mayor!

14:18.483 --> 14:19.818
Okay, I'll do it.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.405
-It's time to vote
-To vote

14:23.488 --> 14:25.741
-And vote for Layton
-Vote for Layton

14:25.824 --> 14:29.036
She is the only one who'll
Save our town from Satan

14:29.119 --> 14:30.120
Save us now

14:30.204 --> 14:32.080
-Let's hope that she
-Hope that she

14:32.164 --> 14:34.333
-Will save us soon
-Save us soon

14:34.416 --> 14:37.169
'Cause we've got strife and tribulation

14:37.252 --> 14:39.421
Strife and tribulation

14:39.505 --> 14:41.632
Grief and consternation

14:41.715 --> 14:43.800
Grief and consternation

14:43.884 --> 14:49.515
Strife and tribulation

14:49.598 --> 14:56.063
In Schmigadoon

14:58.732 --> 15:00.108
Sorry, Pete!

15:01.193 --> 15:05.322
I want you to write
"I will not spy" 500 times.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.200
And do not get up until you do.
Do you understand me?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.085
This is outrageous.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.797
Hey, can I have your pencil, sport?

15:25.050 --> 15:28.428
So, what do you think happened
at the picnic?

15:28.512 --> 15:30.722
Why did your sister get so mad?

15:30.806 --> 15:32.349
She's a mystery.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.520
Here, you can write twice as fast.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.106
Let's see.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.654
We're cheating!

15:45.737 --> 15:47.447
No, I'm not teaching you how to cheat.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.783
This is totally fair.
It's the Air Bud rule.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.954
Oh, boy. There's movies here, right?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.373
Moving pictures?

15:56.456 --> 15:59.334
Oh, yes, sir.
I saw one at the nickelodeon.

15:59.418 --> 16:03.172
It was of a man on a bicycle.
It was like he was right there.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.091
Great. So Air Bud is about a dog

16:06.175 --> 16:09.261
who gets to play
on a middle school basketball team,

16:09.344 --> 16:13.140
because there's nothing in the rule book
that specifically says he can't.

16:13.932 --> 16:18.228
So we're not cheating,
we're just exploiting a loophole.

16:18.312 --> 16:19.646
Gee, thanks!

16:21.815 --> 16:23.984
Carson, I just...

16:24.067 --> 16:25.819
I don't wanna leave you
with the impression

16:25.903 --> 16:27.821
that you shouldn't work hard on stuff.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.367
Or that Air Bud is a good movie.
I mean, it's no Man on Bicycle.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.838
Then you just remove the carbon
from the molten steel

16:44.922 --> 16:48.258
until it reaches a composition
that can maintain the microstructure.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.724
I once had to boil soup in
my stainless steel trash can, long story,

16:55.807 --> 16:58.519
and it saved Thanksgiving, so thank you.

17:00.771 --> 17:01.939
And I just wanna say,

17:02.022 --> 17:06.234
I know it is bonkers for Jorge
to choose me over you.

17:06.318 --> 17:07.861
I mean, you could have anyone.

17:07.944 --> 17:11.490
Alfred Hitchcock would turn down
a custard pie to torture you.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.574
Love is weird.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.203
Oh, it happens all the time, my dear.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.704
Powerful men can never resist the help.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.416
Well, thank you for understanding.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.627
It makes me feel so much better.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.006
It's actually been the story of my life.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.635
Wait. You get a song?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.096
That's surprising.
You're kind of a minor cha--

17:34.179 --> 17:35.931
Wait. My backpack, why--

17:36.014 --> 17:41.311
Once I wooed a Swede named Bjorn
Had his maid bring tea each morn

17:41.395 --> 17:44.147
Turns out horny Bjorn
He loved servant porn

17:44.231 --> 17:47.025
And poof went my plan

17:47.109 --> 17:49.695
I am beautiful and clever

17:49.778 --> 17:55.117
And I always, always never get my man

17:55.200 --> 17:57.703
Should you be driving and singing?

17:57.786 --> 18:03.083
There was Tex who traded stocks
Hired a girl to darn his socks

18:03.166 --> 18:08.839
And when Texy's socks led to sexy talks
I was out on my can

18:08.922 --> 18:11.508
Give my all to each endeavor

18:11.592 --> 18:16.722
And I always, always never get my man

18:16.805 --> 18:22.311
Fell in love with Cole's 1930 Rolls
Dreamed that I would be his bride

18:22.394 --> 18:25.314
But when his chauffeur
Turned out to be a her

18:25.397 --> 18:27.316
They both took me for a ride

18:29.276 --> 18:31.320
How is it still driving?

18:33.197 --> 18:35.782
Seems I'll never end this curse

18:35.866 --> 18:38.660
'Cause now my doctor has this nurse

18:38.744 --> 18:41.330
And what's worse the nurse
Wants me to disperse

18:41.413 --> 18:44.082
Like dust from a fan

18:44.166 --> 18:46.752
So I hope you've had your fun

18:46.835 --> 18:49.963
'Cause the fact is, girl, you're done

18:50.047 --> 18:54.551
'Cause this time, hon
Oh, this time, hon

18:54.635 --> 18:58.430
Yeah, this time, hon
I am gonna

18:58.514 --> 19:04.269
Gonna get my man

19:11.401 --> 19:12.903
What are you doing?

19:13.695 --> 19:14.738
Get out.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.075
Is that stainless steel?

19:18.158 --> 19:23.372
Oh, don't sweet-talk me.
I want Jorge. I love him.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.792
And I'm tired of being told
how well-mannered I am for stepping aside.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.669
Now get out of the car!

19:30.963 --> 19:33.173
And don't even think about coming back.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.510
You can't do this.
I'm not the bad guy here.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.097
You walked into my engagement
and destroyed my future.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.723
That's called being the bad guy.

19:42.474 --> 19:46.520
Yeah, well, it's never explicitly stated,
but I think you're a Nazi.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.690
Of course I'm a Nazi.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.400
Can I at least have my backpa--

20:04.580 --> 20:06.874
You wanna tell me what's going on?

20:07.499 --> 20:12.462
What is going on
is I have been lying to you.

20:13.422 --> 20:17.968
To everyone. But especially to Carson.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.806
I'm not his sister.

20:24.308 --> 20:25.851
I'm his mother.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.145
Oh, Emma.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.191
Look, it wasn't meant to happen.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.611
I was so young, and my parents evicted me,

20:35.694 --> 20:38.363
and I wound up in a maternity ward
for wayward girls,

20:38.447 --> 20:40.532
although we were anything but.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.036
And when Carson was born,

20:44.661 --> 20:47.706
I told everyone, including him,
that he was my brother.

20:48.874 --> 20:51.793
I just couldn't let Mildred Layton
and her biddy brigade

20:51.877 --> 20:54.796
say what they would say about him
if they knew the truth.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.592
But, of course, now you know.

21:00.928 --> 21:04.097
So I understand if this means
it's over between us, Josh.

21:04.181 --> 21:07.893
It doesn't change
how I feel about you, Emma. At all.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
Carson.

21:18.403 --> 21:21.657
I thought I told you to stay in your seat
until you were done.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.992
-You can't possi--
-You lied to me. You're a liar!

21:24.618 --> 21:25.744
No, Carson.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.807
You lost my heart.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.017
I gave you my heart, and you lost it.

21:49.101 --> 21:52.229
Are you sure I didn't give it back to you?
Check your backpack. 'Cause I'm--

21:52.312 --> 21:54.523
Then why do I have your heart?

21:59.319 --> 22:00.904
Maybe I am the bad guy.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.997
Oh, no, is this a dream ballet?

22:10.080 --> 22:12.374
No, no, we're not having a dream ballet.
Okay?

22:12.457 --> 22:14.960
They're annoying and stupid.
They slow everything down.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.837
Nobody likes a dream ballet. Nobody.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.015
I don't have time for one.
I have to get back to Schmiga--

22:30.517 --> 22:33.437
Actually, no, I don't have to get back

22:33.520 --> 22:36.106
because there's nothing for me there.

22:38.108 --> 22:40.235
There's no reason for me
to be anywhere, really,

22:40.319 --> 22:42.237
so might as well be nowhere.

22:48.285 --> 22:52.539
Carson! Carson! Carson!

22:53.207 --> 22:55.125
Well, well, well.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.669
I've walked these woods all my life.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.672
This is the first time
I came across a six-foot snake.

23:00.756 --> 23:03.467
6'1", actually. And my BMI is 19--

23:07.304 --> 23:08.889
That's for stealing my gal.

23:09.765 --> 23:13.393
She isn't even with me anymore,
she's with Doc Lopez.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.581
I'm talking 'bout neon signs
Smoke-filled rooms

23:34.665 --> 23:36.792
Billiard parlors and painted ladies

23:36.875 --> 23:38.877
Wanton women having children
Out of wedlock

23:38.961 --> 23:41.004
Rowdy men using filthy language

23:41.088 --> 23:43.090
The devil himself dancing
On your front porch

23:43.173 --> 23:45.175
Stealing your babies
From their cribs at midnight

23:45.259 --> 23:47.344
Cows and sheep having amorous congress

23:47.427 --> 23:49.596
Children with the mark of the beast
On their foreheads

23:49.680 --> 23:53.642
All thanks to these two out-of-towners
Dr. Skinner and Miss Gimble

23:53.725 --> 23:58.021
Better hold on to your husband
Best keep an eye on your wife

23:58.105 --> 24:01.775
There's gonna be
Some tribulation and strife

24:01.859 --> 24:03.944
-Oh, we've got strife
-Got strife

24:04.027 --> 24:06.780
-And tribulation
-Tribulation

24:06.864 --> 24:10.617
-And not to mention miscegenation
-Ooh, that sounds bad

24:10.701 --> 24:12.744
-Let's pray the Lord
-Pray the Lord

24:12.828 --> 24:14.997
-Will save us soon
-Save us soon

24:15.080 --> 24:18.458
'Cause we've got strife
And tribulation in Schmigadoon!

24:19.501 --> 24:21.670
-It's time to vote
-To vote

24:21.753 --> 24:24.006
-And vote for Layton

24:24.089 --> 24:27.301
She is the only one who'll
Save our town from Satan

Save us now

24:28.468 --> 24:30.345
-Let's hope that she
-Hope that she

24:30.429 --> 24:32.598

-Save us soon

24:32.681 --> 24:35.434
'Cause we've got strife
And tribulation

24:35.517 --> 24:37.686
Strife and tribulation

24:37.769 --> 24:39.897
Grief and consternation

24:39.980 --> 24:42.065
Grief and consternation

24:42.149 --> 24:47.779
Strife and tribulation

24:47.863 --> 24:54.620
In Schmigadoon
