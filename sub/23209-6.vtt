00:06.839 --> 00:09.207
Hail Mary, full
of grace, the Lord is with thee.

00:09.242 --> 00:10.842
Blessed art thou among women,

00:10.877 --> 00:12.544
blessed is the fruit of thy womb...

00:12.578 --> 00:14.546
<i>We're taking heavy fire.</i>

00:14.580 --> 00:16.280
<i>We're gonna drop 'em off,</i>

00:16.315 --> 00:18.183
<i>get back in the air ASAP.</i>

00:21.754 --> 00:23.054
For the next few hours,

00:23.089 --> 00:25.123
this crate is all that matters.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.136
You're gonna protect it
like your mama's inside of it.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.748
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

00:28.782 --> 00:30.372
You do not drop it,
you do not scratch it,

00:30.396 --> 00:31.696
you do not peek inside of it.

00:31.731 --> 00:32.898
And for God's sakes,

00:32.932 --> 00:34.166
you do not lose sight of it.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.134
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

00:36.169 --> 00:38.837
Quon will guide you
to a site east of Hill 862,

00:38.871 --> 00:41.706
where you're gonna deliver
this crate to Bravo Company.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.708
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

00:43.743 --> 00:45.844
<i>Divert south of the river,
divert south of the river.</i>

00:49.348 --> 00:50.426
<i>Got three o'clock, three o'clock.</i>

00:50.450 --> 00:52.884
Rendezvous back at the drop site

00:52.919 --> 00:54.986
at approximately 1900 hours.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.354
Is that cl...

01:00.860 --> 01:01.927
<i>We're on, let's go!</i>

01:01.961 --> 01:04.229
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

You all right, John?

01:19.378 --> 01:20.712
No, I'm scared as hell, man.

01:23.683 --> 01:24.983
Man, look at me, look at me.

01:25.017 --> 01:26.618
Everybody's scared.

01:27.653 --> 01:28.753
I got your back.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.021
And you got mine, okay?

01:30.056 --> 01:31.590
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.624
We go.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.266
There's a village in there. Go.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.334
Damn!

01:42.368 --> 01:44.536
Go! Go!

01:53.646 --> 01:54.990
- Quon!
- What the hell are you doing?

01:55.014 --> 01:56.147
He's been hit,

01:56.182 --> 01:57.192
- I got to go help him!
- No!

01:57.216 --> 01:58.617
We got to stay with the crate!

02:01.621 --> 02:02.621
Please.

02:03.148 --> 02:04.956
Stay put.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.795
Quon.

02:26.245 --> 02:28.647
You're gonna be all right.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.524
John?

02:50.221 --> 02:51.921
John?

02:52.238 --> 02:53.471
John, where are you?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.775
John!

02:58.511 --> 03:00.211
John?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.694
Monsters.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.362
John.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.198
John... John, it's me.

03:20.232 --> 03:21.833
John, it's me.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.201
It's Skinner!

03:58.222 --> 03:59.889
Deputy Director Kersh?

03:59.923 --> 04:01.867
I'm gonna ask you once

04:01.901 --> 04:03.852
and only once:

04:04.561 --> 04:06.195
where is he?

04:06.230 --> 04:08.467
Sir, of whom are we speaking?

04:08.501 --> 04:10.566
Cut the crap, agents.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.863
Have you ever wondered why,

04:15.358 --> 04:18.211
after 35 years in the Bureau,

04:18.236 --> 04:21.387
Walter Skinner isn't sitting
on this side of the desk?

04:21.413 --> 04:22.780
Or even perhaps

04:22.805 --> 04:25.307
running this whole damn agency,
for that matter?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.200
Are you looking for Skinner?

04:28.293 --> 04:31.287
Let me be unambiguous in the event

04:31.321 --> 04:33.689
that there are any questions about this

04:33.724 --> 04:36.291
in your conspiracy-addled minds:

04:36.325 --> 04:39.038
Walter Skinner's stalled career
has everything to do

04:39.073 --> 04:43.032
with his blind loyalty to the both of you

04:43.066 --> 04:45.601
and your misguided search

04:45.636 --> 04:48.170
for some imaginary truth.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.481
Sir, what is this about?

04:50.515 --> 04:52.842
Skinner's gone AWOL, Agent Mulder.

04:52.843 --> 04:54.662
Without warning or explanation.

04:54.696 --> 04:57.514
And frankly, I don't buy your naivetÃ©,

04:57.548 --> 04:59.349
not even for a moment.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.484
He hasn't been the same
since the two of you returned

05:01.519 --> 05:02.669
to the Bureau.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.721
Sir, has anyone checked his apartment?

05:04.755 --> 05:07.251
Could he have had some kind
of medical emergency?

05:07.286 --> 05:09.503
The director's asking questions
about Skinner's activities

05:09.527 --> 05:11.361
that I can't answer.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.265
There's some implication that he
recently started poking around

05:15.299 --> 05:17.500
in places he shouldn't be poking.

05:17.535 --> 05:19.836
What sort of places?

05:19.870 --> 05:21.504
I couldn't say.

05:21.539 --> 05:24.595
But if you truly care
about his future in the FBI,

05:24.629 --> 05:27.043
I suggest you bring him
back here while he still has

05:27.078 --> 05:29.045
a future to return to.

05:35.809 --> 05:37.520
What happened
to the old, reliable Skinner

05:37.555 --> 05:39.222
we knew and loved?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.624
Well, based on his dubious
behavior the past couple months,

05:41.659 --> 05:44.995
it's safe to say the old Skinner
has left the building.

05:46.163 --> 05:48.665
Mulder, do you think his disappearance

05:48.699 --> 05:50.417
actually has to do with us?

05:50.442 --> 05:54.037
Or something to do with William,
or that business with the...

05:54.071 --> 05:55.939
Purlieu Services?

05:55.973 --> 05:57.617
There's no way to tell
what Skinner's been up to

05:57.641 --> 05:59.309
recently.

06:00.010 --> 06:03.180
But I'll keep my eyes peeled
for cigarette butts.

06:13.023 --> 06:15.825
Maybe he's out meeting
with an interior decorator.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.278
I noticed this the last time
that we were here.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.149
No personal items,

06:21.183 --> 06:24.384
no mementos, no knickknacks.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.737
No family photographs.

06:27.772 --> 06:29.455
You know, it occurs to me, Mulder,

06:29.490 --> 06:31.651
that even after all these years,
we know precious little

06:31.675 --> 06:34.490
about Walter Sergei Skinner
beyond the professional.

06:34.524 --> 06:38.281
It appears he may suffer from
moderate-to-severe constipation.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.218
I'm sorry to be a wimp, Mulder,
but this just feels wrong.

06:42.253 --> 06:44.954
This feels like a real invasion
of his privacy.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.990
Well, it's not like Skinner
to just disappear

06:47.024 --> 06:48.825
without telling anyone.

06:48.859 --> 06:51.461
You know, and as much as
I don't trust the guy right now,

06:51.495 --> 06:53.696
if he's gotten himself
into a dangerous situation,

06:53.731 --> 06:55.765
he's gonna forgive us
this little trespass.

06:57.401 --> 06:59.236
Look at this, Mulder.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.806
"Lance Corporal Walter Skinner,
3rd Battalion,

07:02.840 --> 07:05.375
3rd Marines, United States Marine Corps."

07:05.409 --> 07:07.844
Peculiar way to address it.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.850
There's no, uh, return address.

07:18.008 --> 07:19.008
Ugh.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.200
- Is that a...?
- Desiccated human ear.

07:25.649 --> 07:26.960
There's a note.

07:28.223 --> 07:29.796
"The monsters are here."

07:29.830 --> 07:31.801
Monsters, Mulder.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.536
Does that get your juices flowing?

07:33.571 --> 07:37.040
As much as I appreciate any
reference to my juices, Scully,

07:37.074 --> 07:39.175
my only concern here is for Skinner.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.810
Now I'm worried about him.

07:40.845 --> 07:42.378
Me, too.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.949
<i>Mud Lick Messenger.</i>

07:47.685 --> 07:49.452
Mud Lick?

07:53.757 --> 07:55.655
<i>Well, this is strange.</i>

07:55.689 --> 07:58.228
Based on the way
that package was addressed,

07:58.262 --> 07:59.896
I requested some basic information

07:59.930 --> 08:02.398
about Skinner and his platoon in Vietnam,

08:02.433 --> 08:05.168
like, names of his fellow
Marines, et cetera,

08:05.202 --> 08:07.570
and I've just received word
that I've been denied access

08:07.605 --> 08:09.105
by the Bureau.

08:09.139 --> 08:12.408
That the information
is classified top secret.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.245
Well, the sheriff here in Mud Lick says

08:15.279 --> 08:17.647
he's got a body in the morgue
minus an ear.

08:17.681 --> 08:20.750
I have a hunch that
that victim turns out to be

08:20.784 --> 08:24.487
one of Skinner's platoon-mates
from that classified list.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.418
You ain't gonna find no kitten.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.063
What?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.355
Ain't no kitten out there.

08:42.005 --> 08:44.173
No. All right.

08:51.015 --> 08:53.750
Dr. Matthew Wegweiser.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.961
The victim's a medical doctor?

08:54.985 --> 08:56.019
That's correct, ma'am.

08:56.053 --> 08:57.455
Doc Wegweiser is...

08:58.229 --> 09:00.156
was... our one and only town doctor.

09:01.191 --> 09:02.559
He's a... terrific guy.

09:02.593 --> 09:04.127
Beloved.

09:04.161 --> 09:06.733
Went out for a hike
Thursday last, never to return.

09:06.734 --> 09:08.701
Mrs. Wegweiser told us
he hiked the same route

09:08.736 --> 09:10.103
several times a week.

09:10.137 --> 09:11.738
We found him right there on the trail.

09:11.772 --> 09:14.173
Got himself snared
in some kind of hunting trap.

09:14.208 --> 09:17.310
A hunting trap? How do you
account for the severed ear?

09:17.344 --> 09:19.084
Well...

09:20.481 --> 09:22.649
- I can't, honestly.
- And the missing teeth?

09:22.683 --> 09:23.763
Missing teeth?

09:23.788 --> 09:25.295
Well, the autopsy says
that he was missing

09:25.319 --> 09:28.955
several upper and lower molars
and, uh, a couple of bicuspids.

09:28.989 --> 09:30.390
But there's no evidence

09:30.424 --> 09:32.291
of advanced tooth decay or periodontitis.

09:32.326 --> 09:35.600
No evidence of manual extraction.

09:36.601 --> 09:38.431
That mean something to you?

09:38.465 --> 09:40.266
Well, it's funny, because I just happened

09:40.300 --> 09:42.835
to have lost two teeth
in the past month, myself.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.904
And my wife lost one yesterday.

09:44.938 --> 09:47.273
We were puzzling over it at breakfast.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.308
Hmm.

09:49.343 --> 09:51.244
The autopsy also says that there were

09:51.278 --> 09:53.813
wood splinters inside the wound.
This hunting trap,

09:53.847 --> 09:55.848
did it have some kind
of a spear or stake element?

09:55.883 --> 09:57.116
Yes, ma'am.

09:57.151 --> 09:58.951
It was a primitive whip trap.

09:58.986 --> 10:02.555
It's a bent piece of bamboo
held by a trip wire.

10:02.589 --> 10:05.858
It's a sharpened spear
attached at the end.

10:05.893 --> 10:07.326
It's a punji stick.

10:07.361 --> 10:09.599
- Pardon?
- It's a-a simple spear

10:09.633 --> 10:11.697
made of wood or bamboo.
It was used in Vietnam

10:11.732 --> 10:13.676
in any one of a number
of insidious traps or weapons.

10:13.700 --> 10:18.571
Was Dr. Wegweiser here
by any chance a Vietnam vet?

10:19.269 --> 10:21.040
I don't believe he was, no.

10:22.439 --> 10:25.111
Are there any other Vietnam vets
in town that you know of?

10:25.145 --> 10:26.913
Oh, sure. Yeah,

10:26.947 --> 10:29.482
there's an institution outside
of town called Glazebrook.

10:29.516 --> 10:32.518
Lot of guys were sent up there
in the '70s after the war.

10:32.553 --> 10:34.497
Lot of them stuck around
Mud Lick when they got out.

10:34.521 --> 10:36.656
- I think we passed one on our way in.
- Yeah.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.201
That's old Trigger Davis. He's harmless.

10:38.225 --> 10:39.492
Trigger.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.428
Is Glazebrook a mental hospital?

10:42.463 --> 10:44.664
That's right, ma'am.
It's a government-run facility.

10:44.698 --> 10:46.098
I'd like to see a list

10:46.133 --> 10:47.577
of past and current patients, if I could.

10:47.601 --> 10:49.064
Do you have access to that, sir?

10:49.098 --> 10:51.137
Probably not.
They run a tight ship up there,

10:51.171 --> 10:53.506
but I'll see what I can drum up.

10:53.540 --> 10:54.788
Thank you, Sheriff.

10:54.823 --> 10:56.476
Anything to dispel the craziness

10:56.510 --> 10:58.077
everyone in town is buzzing about.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.466
What kind of craziness is that?

11:00.501 --> 11:02.515
People are swearing they seen
some kind of monster

11:02.549 --> 11:03.683
out in the woods.

11:04.939 --> 11:06.519
Hmm.

11:47.227 --> 11:50.830
Pippet? Pippet?

11:57.271 --> 11:59.972
Pippet.

12:00.007 --> 12:01.807
What is it, girl?

12:01.842 --> 12:03.709
What is it?

12:32.929 --> 12:34.155
Tell 'em what you told me, Ed.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.530
Well, Banjo called me up

12:36.564 --> 12:39.032
and said he saw a damn monster
out here in his woods.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.502
Could I come out with him
and take a look around?

12:41.536 --> 12:43.403
We was having that look around

12:43.438 --> 12:45.205
when he just straight disappeared.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.840
Did you say Banjo?

12:46.875 --> 12:47.941
Ozzy Krager.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.743
Friends call him Banjo.

12:49.777 --> 12:51.263
This is his property.

12:51.264 --> 12:53.164
Did he describe this monster?

12:53.199 --> 12:55.467
First he thought it was a bear.

12:55.501 --> 12:56.768
Shh, shh, shh.

12:56.802 --> 12:58.370
But then he saw big ole horns.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.739
And it was walking on two feet.

13:00.773 --> 13:02.707
Same as people in town was talking about.

13:02.742 --> 13:05.470
Uh, Mr. Krager, I mean, uh, Banjo...

13:05.504 --> 13:08.105
w-was he a Vietnam vet?

13:08.139 --> 13:09.731
Yeah, he was.

13:09.765 --> 13:11.212
And this may seem like an odd question,

13:11.236 --> 13:12.517
but was he missing any teeth?

13:13.098 --> 13:14.232
Yeah, he was.

13:14.819 --> 13:16.100
He'd just keep losing them

13:16.135 --> 13:18.740
like he's an old man or something.

13:19.471 --> 13:21.339
Well, I can't make much fun of him

13:21.373 --> 13:23.036
'cause I been losing some, too.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.142
What's this?

13:25.444 --> 13:29.914
That's, uh... that's one
of them deer cams.

13:29.949 --> 13:32.569
Hunters use them for game surveillance.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.305
They can send an alert to your
phone when they detect movement.

13:35.339 --> 13:37.046
Can we review what's on it?

13:37.047 --> 13:39.510
Should be able to see it on
a computer back at the station.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.228
Is there something about that camera

13:42.252 --> 13:43.586
that's troubling you, sir?

13:43.620 --> 13:45.421
Banjo don't have no deer cams.

13:45.934 --> 13:47.890
I mean, least none that I seen,

13:47.925 --> 13:49.926
and I hunt with him, like, every week.

13:57.801 --> 14:00.103
The camera is motion-activated,

14:00.137 --> 14:01.871
so it shouldn't take terribly long

14:01.905 --> 14:03.409
to find what we're looking for.

14:04.661 --> 14:06.242
Oh, geez.

14:08.998 --> 14:10.500
There.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.349
I don't believe it.

14:13.384 --> 14:15.546
There's our killer.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.260
Why do I get the distinct feeling

14:24.294 --> 14:26.329
you two know who that man is?

14:29.352 --> 14:31.134
That how it's gonna be?

14:31.813 --> 14:33.529
I've been nothing but courteous to y'all,

14:33.563 --> 14:35.859
and I don't appreciate
being played a fool.

14:36.317 --> 14:37.974
Excuse me, I got to go tell my people

14:38.008 --> 14:39.976
we found their monster.

14:40.655 --> 14:41.911
Sheriff.

14:41.945 --> 14:43.746
That man is our boss.

14:43.781 --> 14:46.783
Assistant Director
Walter Skinner of the FBI.

14:46.817 --> 14:48.128
Well, what in the hell was he doing

14:48.152 --> 14:50.119
at my crime scene last night?

14:50.154 --> 14:52.124
- That's what we're here to find out.
- So, you're telling me

14:52.148 --> 14:54.824
you knew that man
was here in Mud Lick all along?

14:54.858 --> 14:56.659
Walter Skinner didn't do this.

14:56.693 --> 14:58.461
He's a good man. He's a smart man.

14:58.495 --> 15:02.522
He's been at the FBI for over 30
years, and this murder's sloppy.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.534
I mean, not-not that
he's capable of murder,

15:04.568 --> 15:06.869
but if he was, he certainly
wouldn't get himself

15:06.904 --> 15:09.272
caught on camera at a crime scene.

15:09.306 --> 15:11.474
So, tell me, Agent Scully,
what's your good man

15:11.508 --> 15:13.476
doing standing over a dead body
in the woods

15:13.510 --> 15:14.811
in the middle of the night?

15:14.845 --> 15:17.046
A body which he neglected to call in

15:17.080 --> 15:20.450
to any law enforcement agency,
including his own?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.251
Well, I know it looks bad, Sheriff,

15:22.286 --> 15:24.720
but I assure you, he's not your man.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.856
You can assure me all you want,
Agent Mulder.

15:26.890 --> 15:30.126
I'll decide who my man is when
I get a chance to bring him in

15:30.160 --> 15:31.727
and have a conversation with him.

15:31.762 --> 15:34.532
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go put out an APB

15:34.566 --> 15:37.211
for this Walter Skinner.

15:38.936 --> 15:40.870
What are you doing?

15:40.904 --> 15:43.439
There's more on that tape, Scully.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.988
I'm putting out an all-points bulletin

15:47.023 --> 15:48.414
for a Walter Skinner...

15:48.449 --> 15:50.847
white male, glasses, last seen...

15:50.881 --> 15:53.249
Hurry up. You're gonna get us
run out of town.

15:53.283 --> 15:56.564
Suspect is presumed armed and dangerous.

15:59.817 --> 16:01.724
What did we just see, Mulder?

16:01.758 --> 16:04.193
We find that monster, we find Skinner.

16:04.228 --> 16:05.695
Tell me you don't think that was

16:05.729 --> 16:08.030
some real, actual monster we just saw.

16:08.065 --> 16:09.725
Well, for once, Scully, we agree.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.216
Monsters don't dig pits and set traps.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.277
That was most certainly a man in a mask.

16:13.302 --> 16:14.326
But I'm more concerned

16:14.361 --> 16:16.771
about Skinner's state of mind right now.

16:21.844 --> 16:25.253
Maybe Skinner's experiencing
a delayed form of PTSD

16:25.254 --> 16:27.222
from his time in Vietnam.

16:27.256 --> 16:29.758
It's, uh, not without precedent.

16:29.792 --> 16:33.095
And even the shock of receiving
that ear in the mail...

16:33.129 --> 16:35.430
that's a pretty plausible trigger.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.700
What?

16:38.735 --> 16:39.968
You said trigger.

16:41.104 --> 16:43.972
Trigger. Banjo.

16:44.007 --> 16:45.571
Kitten?

16:46.776 --> 16:48.574
I already told you.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.682
Yeah, you said I wouldn't find Kitten.

16:50.707 --> 16:53.412
But is, uh, is Kitten a person?
Is that somebody's nickname?

16:53.616 --> 16:56.078
I told the Eagle where to find
Kitten's kitten.

16:56.112 --> 16:58.286
- The Eagle.
- Hmm.

17:01.491 --> 17:03.339
Is the Eagle bald?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.054
Hello?

18:06.944 --> 18:08.571
Anybody here?

19:12.510 --> 19:15.090
So I unload into this ditch, right?

19:15.124 --> 19:16.992
And they're deader
than a bag of tent stakes...

19:17.026 --> 19:18.293
the whole lot of them.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.395
And I kneel down next to this little one.

19:20.429 --> 19:23.431
Now, he's got to be no more
than ten, 12 years old,

19:23.466 --> 19:25.734
and I'm about to add another
little adorable charm

19:25.768 --> 19:28.603
to my necklace, huh?

19:28.638 --> 19:31.773
I take out my Ka-Bar, I slice
that little monster's ear

19:31.807 --> 19:34.009
off like a hunk of Wisconsin cheddar.

19:34.043 --> 19:35.510
Oh, man, Kitten...

19:35.545 --> 19:39.080
But all of a sudden, he opens his eyes.

19:39.115 --> 19:40.493
Screams like a banshee!

19:40.528 --> 19:43.051
Takes off into the trees,
hollering the whole way!

19:50.026 --> 19:51.549
You're bleeding, man.

19:56.766 --> 19:59.427
Dang. That's the third one this week.

20:00.694 --> 20:02.404
Hey, they got a tooth fairy in 'Nam?

20:13.816 --> 20:15.450
Get down!

20:24.427 --> 20:25.927
Speak of the devil.

20:29.503 --> 20:31.700
What are you doing in my house?

20:33.299 --> 20:35.136
John, is that you?

20:42.249 --> 20:43.309
John.

20:43.636 --> 20:45.270
I'm not John. I'm Davey.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.980
Davey.

20:49.231 --> 20:51.310
Well, you're John's son.

20:53.488 --> 20:55.289
You're Walter Skinner.

20:55.324 --> 20:57.060
That's right.

20:57.094 --> 20:59.623
Father sure talks a lot about you.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.029
Your father and I...

21:02.495 --> 21:04.080
we went through a lot together.

21:09.071 --> 21:11.005
Calls you baby killer.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.260
Where is your father, Davey?

21:21.305 --> 21:24.151
Father says it's your fault
the way our life turned out.

21:24.186 --> 21:27.154
Because of your testimony
against him after the war,

21:27.189 --> 21:29.857
Father spent 38 years in Glazebrook.

21:31.315 --> 21:32.570
Until I got a letter from him last week,

21:32.594 --> 21:33.794
I thought he was dead.

21:33.829 --> 21:36.101
I spent years searching for him

21:36.135 --> 21:37.932
after his trial, but they vanished him.

21:37.966 --> 21:39.200
His records were sealed.

21:39.234 --> 21:40.897
- Even from me.
- Who vanished him?

21:40.931 --> 21:43.037
Same people responsible for turning him

21:43.071 --> 21:45.806
from the good man he was
when I met him into...

21:52.419 --> 21:53.915
Into what?

21:57.719 --> 21:59.687
I only want to help him.

22:02.658 --> 22:05.860
I'm sorry, I don't believe he
wants your help, Walter Skinner.

22:14.102 --> 22:17.638
Father told me all the stories
about his time in Vietnam.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.792
<i>There were monsters in that jungle.</i>

22:19.827 --> 22:22.710
<i>Because of his exposure to
an experimental weaponized gas.</i>

22:24.947 --> 22:27.581
He wasn't crazy like
you said at his court-martial.

22:27.616 --> 22:29.415
But no one believed him.

22:30.452 --> 22:31.876
Not even Mother.

22:33.288 --> 22:35.031
No one except me.

22:35.065 --> 22:37.625
Listen to me, Davey,
I know what he saw out there.

22:37.659 --> 22:39.060
I got a glimpse of it myself.

22:39.094 --> 22:40.524
But it wasn't real.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.893
It was the gas
using his own fear against him.

22:42.928 --> 22:46.630
Your dad was exposed
to a lot more of it than I was.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.017
And it changed him.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.437
I watched it happen.

22:52.144 --> 22:55.246
And yet you said nothing about that gas

22:55.271 --> 22:56.705
at his trial.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.403
Did you?

23:04.182 --> 23:07.384
They'd let me visit him
sometimes up at Glazebrook.

23:07.419 --> 23:12.056
I had to sign all manner
of non-disclosure documents.

23:15.544 --> 23:18.696
Do you realize how painful it was for me

23:18.730 --> 23:23.200
to see my father wasting away
at that sanitarium?

23:25.203 --> 23:28.005
They kept him behind glass
the whole time.

23:28.039 --> 23:30.207
I couldn't even touch him.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.610
I couldn't touch my own father.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.981
How could you let that happen
to your friend?

23:38.850 --> 23:42.342
I was forbidden to speak about
the gas at his court-martial.

23:42.367 --> 23:43.510
I was following orders.

23:43.535 --> 23:45.903
Doing what my superiors
commanded me to do.

23:46.367 --> 23:47.825
I'm not saying it's right.

23:47.859 --> 23:48.948
It's not.

23:48.983 --> 23:51.795
And I have lived with the guilt
of that decision

23:51.830 --> 23:53.964
every moment since.

23:55.140 --> 23:57.041
I think about him every day.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.804
But you got to understand,

24:00.839 --> 24:03.982
your dad murdered innocent people.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.472
And I know it was because of the
gas, I knew who he was before.

24:07.497 --> 24:09.515
But the man it changed him into...

24:14.486 --> 24:16.209
...he was dangerous, Davey.

24:16.970 --> 24:20.124
People are getting hurt again,
and we can stop it.

24:20.158 --> 24:23.560
But you've got to believe
that I am here to help him.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.629
I only want to make things right.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.368
Please.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.703
Take me to him, Davey.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.445
Okay.

24:43.841 --> 24:45.616
I'll take you to him.

24:48.073 --> 24:50.508
His name is John "Kitten" James.

24:50.533 --> 24:54.596
He is, or was, in fact, a
patient at Glazebrook Hospital,

24:54.621 --> 24:56.863
but his military files,
like the other files

24:56.888 --> 24:59.732
I've tried to access, are classified.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.334
You think it's true, Scully,
what Kersh said?

25:03.368 --> 25:04.663
What's that?

25:04.697 --> 25:06.437
We're the sole reason Skinner's career

25:06.471 --> 25:08.639
hasn't advanced in 30-some years?

25:08.673 --> 25:10.367
No, I hope not.

25:10.392 --> 25:13.175
I'd like to believe that
his choice to stay loyal to us

25:13.528 --> 25:16.947
- Was exactly that: a choice.
- Yeah.

25:16.972 --> 25:18.908
If there's one thing I know
about Walter Skinner is,

25:18.932 --> 25:23.569
he's a man ruled by his
moral compass above all else.

25:23.594 --> 25:26.630
There was a time I would have
agreed with that, unequivocally.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.090
I realize that his conduct
has been strange,

25:29.115 --> 25:30.483
but don't you think
that we should give him

25:30.507 --> 25:31.875
the benefit of the doubt

25:31.900 --> 25:34.101
after everything
we've been through with him?

25:34.126 --> 25:36.795
I mean, especially in light
of what we now understand

25:36.820 --> 25:38.487
he may have sacrificed for us.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.652
Let's just hope we find him
before somebody else does.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.703
Where we going, Davey?

25:56.255 --> 25:58.289
It's not far now.

26:09.534 --> 26:10.868
This is what they drove him to.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.002
Oh, God. No, John, what have you done?

26:14.822 --> 26:16.473
John.

26:32.264 --> 26:34.365
Now who sees monsters?

26:41.710 --> 26:42.944
Help me!

26:42.978 --> 26:45.613
Is somebody out there?

26:45.647 --> 26:46.814
Help!

26:49.051 --> 26:50.785
Why?

26:50.819 --> 26:53.287
No!

27:02.731 --> 27:04.298
Can I help you?

27:04.898 --> 27:07.068
Special Agent Mulder.

27:07.102 --> 27:08.703
Special Agent Dana Scully.

27:08.737 --> 27:10.705
Are you related to John James?

27:10.739 --> 27:13.331
- I'm his son, Davey.
- We're looking for a man

27:13.366 --> 27:15.276
who we have reason to believe
may be in the area

27:15.310 --> 27:17.399
and may have served
with your father in Vietnam,

27:17.434 --> 27:18.714
Walter Skinner?

27:18.748 --> 27:21.582
Uh, I don't believe I've ever
heard that name before, no.

27:21.617 --> 27:22.950
Is your father home?

27:22.985 --> 27:24.185
No, I'm sorry. I...

27:24.219 --> 27:25.556
I haven't a clue where he is.

27:25.591 --> 27:27.455
I haven't seen him in weeks.

27:27.838 --> 27:30.224
Is it okay if we come inside
for a brief moment?

27:30.259 --> 27:33.350
We'd like to get some insight
on a few things.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.761
By all means.

27:35.631 --> 27:37.264
Right this way.

28:25.180 --> 28:28.349
He... Help!

28:28.383 --> 28:30.017
I never met

28:30.052 --> 28:32.444
real live FBI agents before.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.689
Please.

28:34.723 --> 28:37.158
Father said there's two refuges

28:37.192 --> 28:40.449
in life from sorrow.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.897
Music and, uh...

28:44.199 --> 28:45.749
...cats.

28:46.735 --> 28:48.703
But I think cats are creepy.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.475
Could I offer you some tea
or-or something?

28:55.509 --> 28:57.863
- No. No, I'm good.
- No, thank you.

28:58.564 --> 28:59.602
Um...

28:59.637 --> 29:01.082
Mr. James,

29:01.116 --> 29:02.350
we understand that your father

29:02.384 --> 29:04.852
was a patient at Glazebrook?

29:04.887 --> 29:06.521
Uh, yes, uh...

29:07.020 --> 29:08.823
That's right, for many years.

29:08.857 --> 29:10.084
And when was he released?

29:10.118 --> 29:12.026
He was released one month ago.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.327
On what grounds?

29:13.735 --> 29:14.914
Sorry?

29:14.948 --> 29:18.240
Why was he released after he had
been confined for so many years?

29:18.274 --> 29:20.601
They, uh, determined
that he was no longer

29:20.636 --> 29:23.204
a danger to himself or anyone else.

29:23.238 --> 29:24.705
Not that he ever was.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.708
Well, I...

29:27.743 --> 29:30.711
I guess he was a threat to someone.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.414
Is this your mother?

29:34.256 --> 29:36.324
Mother died many years ago.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.387
Father's incarceration
was very hard on her.

29:39.421 --> 29:41.589
Do you mind if I ask how she died?

29:42.097 --> 29:43.257
Yes.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.928
Mr. James, a minute ago,

29:46.962 --> 29:49.499
you said that your father
was a threat to someone.

29:49.533 --> 29:50.765
What did you mean?

29:50.799 --> 29:52.934
Father had secrets.

29:52.968 --> 29:54.068
Secrets?

29:54.102 --> 29:55.436
About the government.

29:55.470 --> 29:56.938
<i>Father was poisoned</i>

29:56.972 --> 29:59.574
<i>by an experimental
weaponized gas in Vietnam.</i>

29:59.608 --> 30:01.362
<i>Because of his exposure,</i>

30:01.396 --> 30:03.911
<i>they continued to do tests on him</i>

30:03.946 --> 30:06.714
<i>and other soldiers like him
for many years at Glazebrook.</i>

30:06.748 --> 30:08.032
What kind of tests?

30:08.066 --> 30:10.184
Chemical, biological.

30:10.218 --> 30:12.330
<i>They were trying to learn
how to control human behavior.</i>

30:12.354 --> 30:16.524
<i>Harnessing our fears
to manipulate us into violence.</i>

30:19.601 --> 30:21.535
Using this weaponized gas?

30:21.560 --> 30:25.029
The gas in, uh, the war was
still in the experimental stage.

30:25.054 --> 30:27.811
And they still haven't perfected
it, but after years

30:27.836 --> 30:29.958
of testing it and honing it,

30:29.992 --> 30:32.807
- they are getting close.
- To what end?

30:32.841 --> 30:34.308
Imagine the power of a government

30:34.343 --> 30:36.510
that could literally control the minds

30:36.545 --> 30:39.113
of millions and millions of its citizens.

30:39.147 --> 30:41.543
To influence every choice
and decision they made

30:41.577 --> 30:44.352
simply by exposing them to this poison.

30:46.989 --> 30:48.589
You'll have to forgive me, Mr. James,

30:48.624 --> 30:52.350
but this sounds like, uh...
like a dystopian novel.

30:52.385 --> 30:55.596
It's happening right now
in the United States of America.

30:55.631 --> 30:57.150
Do you honestly believe that,

30:57.184 --> 31:00.123
after 30 years of research
and development

31:00.124 --> 31:03.159
and decades of experimenting on
American heroes like my father,

31:03.193 --> 31:05.428
it would just be thrown in the trash,

31:05.462 --> 31:07.063
never to be utilized?

31:07.097 --> 31:09.963
Unlikely. The DoD and the CIA
have been working

31:09.997 --> 31:12.335
on various incarnations
of mind control projects

31:12.369 --> 31:13.703
since the '50s.

31:13.737 --> 31:17.840
Project BLUEBIRD, MKUltra, MKDELTA.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.043
Well, those programs
were supposedly ended

31:20.077 --> 31:21.878
in the early 1980s.

31:21.912 --> 31:23.926
- Supposedly.
- My father believed

31:23.961 --> 31:25.581
he was part of the program MK-NAOMI.

31:25.616 --> 31:27.750
It was a, was a successor to MKUltra.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.819
We don't know how they're using
this chemical now,

31:29.853 --> 31:32.288
but we know for certain that they are.

31:33.924 --> 31:35.892
Maybe they're poisoning our water?

31:35.926 --> 31:37.160
Or the food supply?

31:37.194 --> 31:39.302
Maybe they're putting it
in those chemtrails

31:39.303 --> 31:40.997
behind all those commercial jets

31:41.022 --> 31:43.189
that fly over our country
every single day?

31:45.428 --> 31:46.995
Thank you, sir.

31:50.641 --> 31:52.475
Thank you, Mr. James.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.846
You drive.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.320
What's going on, Mulder?

32:01.354 --> 32:04.087
Let's just get in the car and drive away.

32:26.456 --> 32:28.511
Mulder, you want to tell me
what's going on?

32:28.545 --> 32:30.580
He claims not to know
who Skinner is, but in that

32:30.614 --> 32:31.691
photo album I was looking at,

32:31.715 --> 32:32.792
there were all these photos

32:32.816 --> 32:34.884
of his dad and Skinner,
like they were BFFs.

32:34.918 --> 32:38.020
And did you check out that shiny
new SUV parked beside the cabin?

32:38.055 --> 32:39.589
Yeah, that definitely wasn't his.

32:39.623 --> 32:41.134
Skinner could be back there somewhere.

32:41.158 --> 32:42.859
Then, why the hell are we driving away?

32:42.893 --> 32:44.321
Let's pull over here.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.700
Get somewhere you can get cell reception.

32:50.734 --> 32:53.116
Call the sheriff, have him get
every available officer

32:53.151 --> 32:55.505
- down here as soon as he can.
- What are you gonna do?

32:55.530 --> 32:56.730
I'll try to do for Skinner

32:56.765 --> 32:59.033
what I would hope he would do
for either of us.

32:59.067 --> 33:00.378
Mulder.

34:13.871 --> 34:15.572
Help!

34:18.971 --> 34:20.405
Help!

34:34.226 --> 34:35.806
Come on.

34:37.062 --> 34:38.263
Damn it.

34:47.406 --> 34:49.239
Somebody out there?

34:54.746 --> 34:56.748
Hello?

35:07.593 --> 35:09.097
Mulder?

35:09.131 --> 35:10.595
Skinner.

35:13.498 --> 35:15.099
Get me the hell out of here.

35:38.264 --> 35:40.288
I'll boost you, I'll boost you, okay?

35:47.023 --> 35:48.066
Davey.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.169
Davey, please.

35:50.194 --> 35:51.728
Let us out.

35:54.139 --> 35:56.808
- Let's do this quickly. Come on.
- Okay.

36:05.584 --> 36:07.118
Davey.

36:08.461 --> 36:09.761
You don't have to do this.

36:18.330 --> 36:19.464
Scully.

36:32.451 --> 36:33.584
Where's Davey?

36:39.118 --> 36:41.266
Go. Go!

38:02.641 --> 38:04.174
Thank you.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.159
Ambulance is on its way.

38:07.132 --> 38:08.499
I would call Kersh

38:08.524 --> 38:10.525
as soon as you get cell reception.

38:15.671 --> 38:17.448
Something you want to share?

38:20.486 --> 38:22.987
Kersh indicated to us that

38:23.021 --> 38:24.823
we were responsible

38:24.858 --> 38:28.392
for your lack of upward mobility
in the Bureau.

38:30.209 --> 38:32.910
If it wasn't for you two,
I wouldn't be here right now.

38:33.165 --> 38:34.565
I'm not talking about the fact

38:34.600 --> 38:36.214
that you showed up here today.

38:53.772 --> 38:56.568
I enlisted in the Marine Corps
the day that I turned 18.

38:59.825 --> 39:01.225
I was a kid.

39:01.260 --> 39:04.095
Full of callow self-confidence and faith

39:04.129 --> 39:05.368
and this...

39:06.558 --> 39:09.581
this kind of uncorrupted belief that...

39:10.832 --> 39:13.070
I was doing the right thing.

39:13.105 --> 39:14.672
John James...

39:16.741 --> 39:20.210
He didn't enlist. He, uh, he was drafted.

39:22.508 --> 39:26.411
And his whole life was completely upended

39:26.436 --> 39:29.605
by a war that he really, truly
didn't even understand.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.965
He was so afraid all the time.

39:31.990 --> 39:33.658
I felt like I had to protect him.

39:34.699 --> 39:36.149
But I didn't.

39:39.719 --> 39:41.243
I couldn't.

39:44.603 --> 39:47.638
That experience
in Vietnam with John, it...

39:47.673 --> 39:49.740
it put a dent in that blind faith

39:49.775 --> 39:52.006
that I had in my government.

39:52.031 --> 39:54.766
It planted seeds of-of mistrust.

39:54.791 --> 39:58.194
I tried for years to...
to suppress that mistrust,

39:58.219 --> 39:59.586
but it gnawed at me.

40:02.425 --> 40:04.388
Then you two...

40:08.881 --> 40:11.416
You two came along and you taught me

40:11.441 --> 40:14.210
not to hide from it, but to...

40:14.493 --> 40:17.562
have the guts to shine a light

40:17.587 --> 40:19.688
directly into the darkest corners.

40:19.713 --> 40:23.549
And if given the choice
between advancing my career

40:23.574 --> 40:25.375
by being blindly loyal to some

40:25.400 --> 40:28.102
faceless puppeteers pulling
strings from the shadows

40:28.127 --> 40:30.529
or to throw in with you two,
make no mistake about it,

40:30.554 --> 40:34.090
I'd make the same decision
every single damn time.

40:38.543 --> 40:40.044
So I'm gonna go back.

40:40.069 --> 40:42.070
I'm gonna kiss the ring.

40:44.896 --> 40:46.731
But I intend to do right by this man.

40:46.765 --> 40:48.132
And that means finding the truth

40:48.166 --> 40:50.134
of what the hell it was
they used him for.

40:50.765 --> 40:52.603
No matter the cost.

40:59.043 --> 41:00.677
I owe him that.

41:04.282 --> 41:05.947
I owe myself that.

41:22.934 --> 41:24.135
Skinner.

41:26.238 --> 41:28.139
We're with you.

42:30.702 --> 42:32.770
<i>Imagine the power of a government</i>

42:32.804 --> 42:34.772
