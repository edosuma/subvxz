<i>They will face challenges</i>
<i>from the ocean's edge...</i>

00:42.309 --> 00:44.678
Gordon:

00:59.526 --> 01:01.695
<i>creating dish after</i>
<i>stunning dish...</i>

01:01.695 --> 01:03.497
I think that is
out of this world.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.132
<i>to win the title of...</i>

01:18.679 --> 01:22.016
I'm 53 years old
and I'm a native‐born
Texas rancher.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.852
<i>I'm not your average cowboy.</i>
<i>I have a passion for food.</i>

01:24.852 --> 01:26.887
I'm here to win
this son of a bitch,
and I'm not joking.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.962
Eboni:
<i>I am a mother of four from</i>
<i>the south side of Chicago.</i>

01:34.962 --> 01:36.063
I have had a hard life.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.965
Nothing was ever
given to me easy.

01:37.965 --> 01:41.235
<i>I think that's why</i>
<i>I need to win "MasterChef,"</i>
<i>to show my kids,</i>

01:41.235 --> 01:42.336
you know, they can be
something great still.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.041
Dino:
<i>I'm a ballet dancer</i>
<i>from Bensonhurst, New York.</i>

01:47.041 --> 01:49.310
Being a ballet dancer,
food is very important.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.978
You gotta eat right,
eat healthy.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.013
<i>The better I eat, the better</i>
<i>I look in my tights,</i>

01:53.013 --> 01:55.049
the better my cannoli looks.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.188
‐ We love you.
We praise you, Lord.
‐ Thank you, Jesus.

02:01.188 --> 02:04.191
Announcer:
<i>Our first battle for an apron</i>
<i>features Yachecia...</i>

02:04.191 --> 02:06.493
‐ Yes, God.
‐ <i>and Shawn,</i>

02:06.493 --> 02:09.930
<i>two heavenly home cooks</i>
<i>with a higher calling.</i>

02:09.930 --> 02:12.533
You gotta pray for me, man,
because I'm going up
against another pastor.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.035
‐ You're going home
in Jesus' name!
‐ In the name.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.340
Yachecia:
<i>Being a minister,</i>
<i>it's just my life.</i>

02:19.340 --> 02:20.974
It's not really what I do.
It's who I am.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.811
I feel a lifting
in my spirit. Hallelujah.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.279
<i>In church we cook a lot.</i>

02:25.279 --> 02:27.114
I believe that food
is a part of my calling.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.116
I wanna feed body
and feed the soul.

02:29.116 --> 02:32.152
Look at that! Yum!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.221
I call my cooking
sassy southern fusion.

02:34.221 --> 02:37.524
<i>I take all the classic recipes</i>
<i>and elevate it a little bit.</i>

02:37.524 --> 02:39.493
Yes! Oh!

02:39.493 --> 02:41.662
<i>It's gotta make me sing.</i>
<i>It's gotta make me dance.</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:44.498
If it doesn't do that,
you can't eat it.
I can't give it to you.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.567
I can't leave here
without being
the next MasterChef.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.172
Announcer:
<i>Standing in her way is Shawn,</i>
<i>a Washington pastor</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:54.975
<i>who's praying his cooking</i>
<i>is on a higher plane.</i>

02:54.975 --> 02:58.712
And you have the faith
to live holy!

02:58.712 --> 03:00.280
My parents were
really busy growing up,

03:00.280 --> 03:01.915
<i>so I grew up in a house</i>

03:01.915 --> 03:04.017
<i>with mostly TV dinners</i>
<i>every night.</i>

03:04.017 --> 03:06.320
When I left home,
it was an opportunity

03:06.320 --> 03:09.590
<i>to explore real food</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

03:09.590 --> 03:11.992
That's a beautiful
duck breast.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.294
<i>As a pastor, I've lived</i>
<i>all over the United States.</i>

03:14.294 --> 03:15.662
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

03:15.662 --> 03:17.831
<i>I was immersed</i>
<i>in a different culture.</i>

03:17.831 --> 03:19.600
<i>So I would say</i>
<i>that my style of cooking</i>

03:19.600 --> 03:20.701
is global comfort food.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.836
Both:
MasterChef! MasterChef!

03:25.939 --> 03:27.975
‐ We got this, Shawn.
‐ Yeah!

03:27.975 --> 03:30.110
‐ Let's do this thing.
‐ That's right.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.550
Make your way
down to the front.
Thank you.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.818
Yachecia:
<i>I love Shawn,</i>

03:37.818 --> 03:39.219
<i>he's an amazing man,</i>

03:39.219 --> 03:41.955
but he's going down
in Jesus' name.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.359
‐ Hi.
‐ Welcome to your
MasterChef battle

03:45.359 --> 03:48.896
‐ for that elusive
white apron...
‐ Yes.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.498
and a spot in the biggest
culinary competition
anywhere in the world.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.334
Incredible.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.337
Now, in your battle,
you'll be making one of
the most beloved,

03:57.337 --> 03:59.973
quintessential
American dishes
of all time.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.813
The is the battle
of the almighty

04:05.813 --> 04:09.316
‐ fried chicken.
‐ Yeah!

04:09.316 --> 04:11.418
Okay. Awesome.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.588
It's crispy, crunchy,
golden on the outside,

04:14.588 --> 04:17.024
and absolutely
packed with flavor.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.594
But before we get to this,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.330
we start with this.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.769
I'm going to show you
the perfect way

04:28.769 --> 04:30.938
to break down a chicken.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.841
Watch very carefully.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.044
First off, the thighs,
you nick with a knife.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.781
Pull back the skin
and pop out that knuckle

04:40.781 --> 04:43.383
and slice through.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.953
Find your point,
let the knife do the work.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.023
And look.
Drum, drum, thigh, thigh.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.125
Next, one of
the most popular cuts,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.895
the stunning chicken wing.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.130
Feel where the joint is. Cut.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.166
Let the knife do the work.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.769
Wing, wing. From there,
feel the breast bone.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.004
Run the knife across the top,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.573
come down to the point
where the wishbone is,

05:06.573 --> 05:08.575
hand on, and through.

05:08.575 --> 05:12.079
Using the tip,
keeping it as close to
the carcass as possible,

05:12.079 --> 05:16.416
making sure that you leave
no protein anywhere on there.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.853
Two drums, two thighs,
two breasts, two wings.

05:19.853 --> 05:23.624
That is how you
break down a chicken

05:23.624 --> 05:25.592
like a true MasterChef.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.927
‐ Beautiful, Chef.
‐ Amazing.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.767
Tonight you'll just
have 30 minutes

05:33.767 --> 05:35.869
to take that whole chicken

05:35.869 --> 05:39.106
and turn it into
a MasterChef‐worthy batch

05:39.106 --> 05:40.941
of delicious,
crispy fried chicken.

05:42.943 --> 05:47.714
‐ Are you both ready?
‐ Almost. I'm ready now.

05:47.714 --> 05:51.351
Your 30 minutes
starts right now.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.622
All right, here we go.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.125
This really is
a MasterChef technique

05:58.125 --> 06:00.227
that you have to nail
before you can show us

06:00.227 --> 06:02.829
that you can nail
fried chicken.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.299
They're up against it.
30 minutes to break down
the chicken,

06:05.299 --> 06:09.770
marinate the chicken,
bread the chicken,
and fry it.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.738
And you know
that's a tall order.

06:14.341 --> 06:18.612
So, Shawn, talk to me
a little bit about
your fried chicken.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.913
Shawn: I lived
for two years in Hawaii,

06:19.913 --> 06:22.583
so I'm doing
a little Hawaiian style.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.685
It's a five‐spice
fried chicken

06:24.685 --> 06:27.254
and I'm making
a hoisin barbecue sauce
for you to go with it.

06:27.254 --> 06:31.692
And I saw rather than using
a liquid oil of some sort,

06:31.692 --> 06:36.129
‐ I just saw a stick of lard
in those cast iron skillets.
‐ That's right!

06:36.129 --> 06:40.000
Well, in all honesty,
the pork, for me, is again,
a throwback to Hawaii,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.802
'cause pork is such a huge
part of the culture there.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.370
All right.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.375
Yachecia,
you going shopping?

06:48.375 --> 06:52.946
You cannot make
real home‐fried chicken
without a paper bag.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.781
Now, this recipe,
where did it come from?

06:54.781 --> 06:56.850
The church that
I grew up in in Detroit,

06:56.850 --> 06:59.486
we had fried chicken
every Sunday morning.

06:59.486 --> 07:02.255
We season everything,
so my dredge is seasoned.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.991
I've seasoned
the chicken itself,

07:03.991 --> 07:07.775
and then
my buttermilk is seasoned,
and so is my oil.

07:07.775 --> 07:11.311
And, you know, in
the African‐American culture,
fried chicken is a staple.

07:11.311 --> 07:13.447
So basically,
if I lose to Shawn,
I'm gonna get traded out.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.218
Right, ten minutes to go.

07:20.053 --> 07:21.088
Yeah!

07:22.823 --> 07:24.224
I think Shawn's got
way too much color.

07:24.224 --> 07:26.326
He's using a mixture
of lard and butter.

07:26.326 --> 07:27.995
Yachecia's
using canola oil.

07:27.995 --> 07:30.164
Lard and butter are gonna
have a lower burning point,

07:30.164 --> 07:32.332
which is why we're getting
so much color on the outside.

07:32.332 --> 07:34.401
He's really gonna need to put
that chicken in the oven

07:34.401 --> 07:36.336
to make sure it's cooked
all the way through.

07:39.473 --> 07:41.642
‐ All right.
‐ I'm a little worried
about Yachecia.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.477
She's frying
the chicken entirely,

07:43.477 --> 07:45.245
and she's not finishing it
off in the oven.

07:45.245 --> 07:47.447
She's just living
with the Lord on her side.

07:47.447 --> 07:49.483
Somebody getting saved today.

07:49.483 --> 07:51.185
60 seconds remaining.
Let's go.

07:56.757 --> 07:59.092
‐ Gordon: Ten..
‐ Judges: Nine, eight,

07:59.092 --> 08:01.628
seven, six, five,

08:01.628 --> 08:04.898
four, three, two, one,

08:04.898 --> 08:06.466
‐ And stop!
‐ That's it.

08:06.466 --> 08:08.101
‐ Hands in the air!
‐ Well done.

08:08.101 --> 08:10.070
‐ Nice job!
‐ Good job.

08:10.070 --> 08:12.372
Awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome.

08:12.372 --> 08:15.542
Now, very carefully,
please bring those
incredible boxes of chicken

08:15.542 --> 08:17.544
down to the front.
Thank you.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.918
Right. Yachecia.

08:27.621 --> 08:30.924
Wow. That looks beautiful.

08:30.924 --> 08:34.428
‐ Tell me about the breading.
‐ So I used all‐purpose flour,

08:34.428 --> 08:37.397
a little bit of cornmeal
just for a little added crunch,

08:37.397 --> 08:40.100
and then a little
bit of extra cayenne,
some salt, paprika,

08:40.100 --> 08:42.636
‐ and lots of black pepper.
‐ Now the sauce‐‐

08:42.636 --> 08:44.071
It's called "Sweet Hotness,"

08:44.071 --> 08:47.841
so, a little bit of honey
and a little bit of spice.

08:47.841 --> 08:51.011
That, young lady,
is beautiful.

08:55.682 --> 08:57.918
‐ That chicken's delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

08:57.918 --> 09:01.255
Good color,
the crispiness is perfect.

09:01.255 --> 09:04.057
It's spicy, so I'm not
too sure if you'll get
through your second piece.

09:04.057 --> 09:08.629
‐ But your chicken has love.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.035
That's juicy chicken.

09:15.035 --> 09:19.373
What I'm in marvel of
is the idea of cooking
the chicken so consistently.

09:19.373 --> 09:22.376
I think the actual breading
needs a little bit more pizazz.

09:22.376 --> 09:24.811
‐ But that is
a pleasant bite.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

09:27.781 --> 09:29.216
‐ Shawn.
‐ Yes, sir.

09:29.216 --> 09:32.252
Let's have a look. Wow.

09:32.252 --> 09:34.254
What's the seasoning
in the flour?

09:34.254 --> 09:37.324
I have mostly five spice,
and then paprika, garlic,

09:37.324 --> 09:40.160
salt and pepper,
a little bit of oregano,
and basil.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.765
Why so many different
add‐ons into that?

09:44.765 --> 09:47.668
Well, I tell everybody
that my top two influences

09:47.668 --> 09:49.136
‐ are God and Gordon.
‐ Right.

09:49.136 --> 09:50.337
‐ And I know
you love flavor.
‐ Yes, I do.

09:50.337 --> 09:52.940
So I wanted to give you
a wide variety of flavor.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.442
My thigh
is cooked beautifully.

09:55.442 --> 09:57.911
The spiciness is there.

09:57.911 --> 09:59.980
It doesn't look
that attractive

09:59.980 --> 10:03.016
with the different layers
of sort of colors.

10:03.016 --> 10:05.619
And the sauce has been
reduced down a little touch.

10:05.619 --> 10:08.155
But you definitely
nailed the fried chicken.

10:08.155 --> 10:10.424
‐ It's an honor. Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

10:12.826 --> 10:14.995
It's tasty, it's messy.

10:14.995 --> 10:16.596
It's all the things
fried chicken should be.

10:16.596 --> 10:18.532
I'm more of a classic gal,

10:18.532 --> 10:20.200
so I was a little bit
concerned about

10:20.200 --> 10:22.703
how I would take on
the five spice and
the dipping sauce.

10:22.703 --> 10:24.671
You definitely
made me a believer.

10:24.671 --> 10:26.673
The one weak point of
your box of fried chicken

10:26.673 --> 10:31.111
is that not every piece
of chicken is perfectly
coated in that crust.

10:31.111 --> 10:33.780
‐ But overall, really
delicious fried chicken.
‐ Thank you so much.

10:41.021 --> 10:44.891
Yachecia, Shawn.
You both nailed the butchery
of the chicken.

10:44.891 --> 10:46.994
You nailed the cook
on the chicken.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.162
Both of your chickens
were juicy and tender.

10:49.162 --> 10:53.000
However, we can only give
one of you that apron.

10:59.139 --> 11:00.774
One apron, and with it,

11:00.774 --> 11:03.510
one place in
the MasterChef kitchen.

11:05.812 --> 11:08.849
This apron belongs to...

11:19.381 --> 11:21.276
One apron, and with it,

11:21.276 --> 11:23.797
one place in
the MasterChef kitchen.

11:23.797 --> 11:27.166
This apron belongs to...

11:29.172 --> 11:32.209
‐ Yachecia.
Congratulations.
‐ Yes! Hallelujah!

11:32.209 --> 11:34.377
Hallelujah.
Put that apron on.

11:34.377 --> 11:38.215
Whoo! Thank you so much.

11:38.215 --> 11:41.618
So cool.
So proud of you.
Good job.

11:41.618 --> 11:45.522
Yachecia, it was that length
that you let that chicken

11:45.522 --> 11:47.858
fry at that lower temperature

11:47.858 --> 11:49.459
that gave you the slight edge.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.796
And that is what being
a MasterChef is all about.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.731
Gordon: Shawn,
you're a passionate man,

11:54.731 --> 11:57.234
and you were born
to serve the community,

11:57.234 --> 11:59.703
but I think you were
born to cook.

11:59.703 --> 12:02.205
‐ Don't stop.
‐ Thank you.

12:02.205 --> 12:05.208
( cheering )

12:05.208 --> 12:07.010
( screaming )

12:16.419 --> 12:18.522
I've always
had a fire for cooking,
but after today,

12:18.522 --> 12:20.190
Gordon fanned that flame.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.725
‐ I'm really proud of you.
‐ Thank you.

12:21.725 --> 12:22.826
I prayed for Yachecia.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.394
Maybe I prayed
a little bit too hard.

12:24.394 --> 12:26.196
But at the end of the day,

12:26.196 --> 12:28.565
I know that she's gonna
make it all the way
to the finale

12:28.565 --> 12:32.202
‐ as the next MasterChef.
‐ Oh, thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Jesus.

12:34.237 --> 12:35.739
Announcer:
<i>Hoping to strike</i>
<i>a chord with the judges</i>

12:35.739 --> 12:38.008
<i>in our next battle</i>
<i>is Jason...</i>

12:38.008 --> 12:39.676
‐ Be yourself.
‐ Yeah.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.712
<i>a high school music teacher</i>
<i>from Newton, Massachusetts.</i>

12:42.712 --> 12:45.215
Jason: <i>Just like in</i>
<i>the orchestra when I'm working</i>
<i>with different instruments,</i>

12:45.215 --> 12:48.919
when I put food together
on the plate, I want to get
the crunchy, the sweet,

12:48.919 --> 12:52.389
<i>the salty, and orchestrate it</i>
<i>into something that really</i>
<i>makes a harmonious dish.</i>

12:52.389 --> 12:55.759
‐ Delicious!
‐ Thinking it's like
conducting a symphony.

12:55.759 --> 12:58.728
‐ Symphony on the plate,
symphony on the plate.
‐ Yes.

12:58.728 --> 13:00.297
<i>I grew up in</i>
<i>a Chinese‐American household</i>

13:00.297 --> 13:02.232
<i>where no ingredient</i>
<i>went to waste.</i>

13:02.232 --> 13:05.802
<i>We always had at least</i>
<i>six or seven dishes</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

13:05.802 --> 13:07.571
So when people
come to eat at my house,

13:07.571 --> 13:09.673
<i>I'm not just gonna</i>
<i>feed you one item.</i>

13:09.673 --> 13:11.508
<i>I'm gonna feed you this,</i>
<i>I'm gonna feed you that.</i>

13:11.508 --> 13:15.011
That's the way we do it,
the Jason way.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.380
Announcer:
<i>But standing in Jason's way</i>
<i>is a home cook</i>

13:17.380 --> 13:20.083
<i>that wants to prove</i>
<i>that he's more than</i>
<i>meets the eye.</i>

13:20.083 --> 13:23.587
I'm Ty. I'm from
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
and I'm a model.

13:23.587 --> 13:25.589
It's basically gonna be
fashion on a plate.

13:25.589 --> 13:28.358
<i>I've been modeling for</i>
<i>four and a half years now.</i>

13:28.358 --> 13:31.661
What they don't know
is this model has traveled
a lot across the U. S.

13:31.661 --> 13:33.163
<i>Going to different locations,</i>

13:33.163 --> 13:34.664
<i>I get a chance to taste</i>
<i>different foods,</i>

13:34.664 --> 13:36.433
experience different
cultures,

13:36.433 --> 13:38.268
see the way
their techniques are,

13:38.268 --> 13:41.538
<i>and I bring all those tools</i>
<i>back with me to Oklahoma</i>

13:41.538 --> 13:42.706
and make it my own
little style.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.410
<i>I know how</i>
<i>to bring the flavor.</i>

13:47.410 --> 13:48.612
I'm gonna show these judges

13:48.612 --> 13:49.779
what true
Oklahoma cooking is about.

13:56.186 --> 13:57.887
Come on down, please.

13:57.887 --> 14:00.457
Jason:
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what we're cooking,</i>

14:00.457 --> 14:03.193
but whatever the judges
throw at us, I'm sure
I can handle.

14:03.193 --> 14:05.061
White apron! Jason Ling!

14:06.630 --> 14:09.366
Jason and Ty,
in your battle tonight,

14:09.366 --> 14:12.502
you'll be making a dish

14:12.502 --> 14:15.839
using the jewel of the sea.

14:19.743 --> 14:21.344
Scallops.

14:26.182 --> 14:29.919
Tonight in this battle,
you'll both have 30 minutes

14:29.919 --> 14:33.056
to cook us a fully‐composed
scallop dish

14:33.056 --> 14:36.493
that screams you.

14:36.493 --> 14:38.595
Your time starts...

14:40.830 --> 14:41.931
now!

14:46.569 --> 14:48.571
So, Jason,
What's the dish?

14:48.571 --> 14:50.073
What are you making and why?

14:50.073 --> 14:53.462
I grew up in an
Asian‐American household,

14:53.462 --> 14:55.064
always three, four, five, six,

14:55.064 --> 14:56.317
seven different things
on the plate.

14:56.317 --> 14:58.319
So I'm presenting you
a trio of scallops.

14:58.319 --> 15:01.088
The first preparation
is going to be a sashimi style.

15:01.088 --> 15:02.590
I'm marinating with
a little lemon juice,

15:02.590 --> 15:04.825
white balsamic, and soy sauce.

15:04.825 --> 15:07.628
Item number two
is a steamed scallop
with ginger and scallions.

15:07.628 --> 15:09.497
The third item is going to
be a pan‐seared scallop

15:09.497 --> 15:12.299
atop of a bed of sautéed
pea shoots with garlic.

15:12.299 --> 15:15.002
Scallops three ways.
Huge amounts of jeopardy.

15:15.002 --> 15:16.804
Why not one way perfectly?

15:16.804 --> 15:18.539
I am a high school
music teacher.

15:18.539 --> 15:19.640
I conduct orchestra,

15:19.640 --> 15:21.142
and it kind of
reflects my cooking.

15:21.142 --> 15:23.477
It's always a symphony
of flavors on the plate.

15:23.477 --> 15:24.545
Okay.

15:26.814 --> 15:27.815
So, how about you, Ty?

15:27.815 --> 15:29.984
I'm 28,
I live in Oklahoma City,

15:29.984 --> 15:32.453
and I'm a male model.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.387
When I was in New York City
doing Fashion Week

15:33.387 --> 15:35.189
was the first time
I ever had scallops,

15:35.189 --> 15:37.057
and it changed my life.

15:37.057 --> 15:39.360
So tonight I'm making you
some pan‐seared scallops

15:39.360 --> 15:43.631
on a smoky aioli
with a citrus salad.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.567
Gordon: Gentlemen,
20 minutes gone.

15:46.567 --> 15:49.003
10 minutes remaining.

15:49.003 --> 15:52.506
Two stunning‐sounding
scallop dishes,

15:52.506 --> 15:55.809
one apron up for grabs.

15:55.809 --> 16:00.381
So, you've got a case
of Ty's simple scallops
with the citrus

16:00.381 --> 16:02.850
up against Jason's
scallops three ways.

16:02.850 --> 16:04.485
I mean, is that
over‐ambitiousness?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.686
Is he trying
to show off too much?

16:05.686 --> 16:08.322
Jason's dish
has to be a home run.

16:08.322 --> 16:10.124
There's something to be said
for keeping it simple

16:10.124 --> 16:11.992
and just nailing
that scallop.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.663
Gents, two minutes left.

16:15.663 --> 16:18.098
‐ You gotta move, Jason.
‐ Gordon: Let's go.

16:18.098 --> 16:21.268
Use every second available

16:21.268 --> 16:25.439
to get your hands
on that apron.

16:25.439 --> 16:27.374
‐ Aarón: Come on.
‐ Gordon: Let's go.
Last 10 seconds.

16:27.374 --> 16:28.709
Oh, my goodness.

16:28.709 --> 16:32.379
Gordon:
Nine, eight, seven, six.

16:32.379 --> 16:36.850
Judges: Five, four,
three, two, one.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.320
‐ Gordon: And stop. Well done.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

16:47.294 --> 16:51.498
Two scallop dishes,
both with individual styles.

16:51.498 --> 16:54.235
Tonight, only one apron
is up for grabs.

16:54.235 --> 16:58.005
Right, Jason.

16:58.005 --> 16:59.807
‐ Chef Ramsay.
‐ Describe the dish, please.

16:59.807 --> 17:01.675
We have a trio
of sea scallops.

17:01.675 --> 17:03.844
The first preparation
is a sashimi scallop

17:03.844 --> 17:06.113
julienne kohlrabi
with some celery leaves.

17:06.113 --> 17:08.816
The second preparation
is a steamed scallop

17:08.816 --> 17:10.451
on a bed of vermicelli.

17:10.451 --> 17:12.620
The third preparation
is stir‐fried pea shoots

17:12.620 --> 17:14.922
with garlic
and the seared scallop.

17:14.922 --> 17:16.590
Why so much on one plate?

17:16.590 --> 17:18.659
That's the way
my head is inside.

17:18.659 --> 17:20.661
As a musician,
I just go from one thing

17:20.661 --> 17:22.263
to the next
to the next to the next.

17:22.263 --> 17:27.001
But you're not writing music,
you're cooking food.

17:28.302 --> 17:30.371
Why raw kohlrabi?

17:30.371 --> 17:32.039
It is an homage
to my grandmother.

17:32.039 --> 17:34.141
She's from Beijing,
and growing up,

17:34.141 --> 17:35.876
we had a lot of different
salad‐type things,

17:35.876 --> 17:37.778
and I really enjoy
that fresh component.

17:37.778 --> 17:39.980
You steamed this
with what?

17:39.980 --> 17:42.816
Shaoxing wine, soy
and ginger and scallion.

17:42.816 --> 17:44.685
How did you cook
the last one?

17:44.685 --> 17:46.954
The scallop is seared
with grape seed oil

17:46.954 --> 17:49.223
and there's a little bit
of coriander crust.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.394
So, the sashimi is delicious.

17:53.394 --> 17:54.895
Love the freshness
of the kohlrabi.

17:54.895 --> 17:57.731
Love that idea.
The flavor of
the last scallop

17:57.731 --> 18:00.234
is, on its own,
mind‐blowing.

18:00.234 --> 18:01.969
Thank you.

18:01.969 --> 18:03.304
But the steamed one needs
a little bit more help.

18:03.304 --> 18:05.105
It looks quite bland
because the noodles

18:05.105 --> 18:07.107
and the color of
the scallops is the same.

18:08.842 --> 18:11.478
Man, you've given me
a lot to think about.

18:27.194 --> 18:30.431
This one preparation,
which is the roasted scallop‐‐

18:30.431 --> 18:33.100
the color is textbook.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.104
The combination
of flavors is genius.

18:37.104 --> 18:39.106
These other
two preparations
were not necessary.

18:39.106 --> 18:41.875
That sesame oil,
those very assertive flavors,

18:41.875 --> 18:43.444
it's like putting
too much cologne on.

18:43.444 --> 18:45.479
Just like in music,
food needs to be
corralled in.

18:45.479 --> 18:47.314
Thank you
for your feedback.

18:49.950 --> 18:53.520
Ty, describe
the dish, please.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.823
Ty: We have
a pan‐seared scallop,

18:55.823 --> 18:57.891
the salad with
grapefruit vinaigrette,

18:57.891 --> 19:01.228
the pomegranate, blood orange,
and grapefruit,

19:01.228 --> 19:03.831
as well as a smoky aioli,

19:03.831 --> 19:07.134
which really is gonna
fine‐tune the Oklahoma taste

19:07.134 --> 19:09.770
and style that I
bring to the dish.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.772
They're cooked beautifully.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.811
First of all,
you've nailed the scallops.

19:17.811 --> 19:20.848
But there's a lot of heat
in that sauce.

19:20.848 --> 19:23.417
The salad's
a little bit overdressed

19:23.417 --> 19:25.953
when you've got
a heavy vinaigrette
with that spice as well.

19:25.953 --> 19:27.521
I think more than anything,

19:27.521 --> 19:29.757
I want to see
a little bit more from you.

19:29.757 --> 19:31.592
But, listen,
it's a really strong effort.

19:31.592 --> 19:33.794
Thank you, Chef.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.966
I think the grapefruit
is a super smart move.

19:38.966 --> 19:41.135
The pomegranates
have a nice, fresh
brightness and pop.

19:41.135 --> 19:42.636
I look at Jason's dish

19:42.636 --> 19:45.339
and I wonder
if he went too far.

19:45.339 --> 19:48.842
For you, I wonder
if you played it
a little too safe.

19:48.842 --> 19:51.945
That said,
it's gonna be tight.

19:51.945 --> 19:53.547
Thank you, Chef.

19:56.016 --> 19:58.519
‐ It's a tough one, this one.
‐ They're both talented.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.169
This apron represents a place

20:15.169 --> 20:17.738
in the biggest cooking
competition on the planet.

20:20.407 --> 20:22.075
This apron belongs to...

20:35.889 --> 20:37.491
( cheering )

20:47.734 --> 20:51.038
I can't believe
that I just won
a MasterChef apron.

20:51.038 --> 20:53.106
<i>I know my students</i>
<i>will be proud of me,</i>

20:53.106 --> 20:55.709
<i>and my mom is such a big</i>
<i>inspiration for my food life.</i>

20:55.709 --> 20:58.278
To have her here
is just so amazing.

20:58.278 --> 21:00.848
I'm so happy for you, my boy.

21:00.848 --> 21:04.218
Announcer:
<i>So Jason joins Yachecia</i>
<i>in this year's Top 20.</i>

21:04.218 --> 21:07.287
<i>And as the battles continue,</i>
<i>our judges were demonstrating</i>

21:07.287 --> 21:09.356
<i>that the key to becoming</i>
<i>a great MasterChef...</i>

21:09.356 --> 21:10.991
Any air in there
and we're in trouble.

21:10.991 --> 21:13.961
<i>is the ability to perfect...</i>

21:13.961 --> 21:15.195
Watch very carefully.

21:15.195 --> 21:17.564
<i>the essential</i>
<i>culinary techniques.</i>

21:17.564 --> 21:21.168
Speed will wrap
the egg white
around the yolk.

21:21.168 --> 21:25.672
You want to remove
what you call the quill.

21:25.672 --> 21:27.574
Even pressure is key.

21:27.574 --> 21:31.144
I need stunning pasta
so thin I can almost
see through it.

21:31.144 --> 21:33.413
Wow.

21:33.413 --> 21:35.549
<i>And these home cooks</i>
<i>faced off...</i>

21:35.549 --> 21:38.719
We want to be impressed
with your ability
to be a great student.

21:38.719 --> 21:40.854
<i>only the very best</i>
<i>had the skills...</i>

21:40.854 --> 21:43.757
Look at that.
You know how to poach
an egg, girl.

21:43.757 --> 21:45.859
It's like tracing paper.
You rolled the pasta
beautifully.

21:45.859 --> 21:47.160
<i>and the artistry...</i>

21:47.160 --> 21:48.829
The squid is spot on.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.265
That's the start
of an amazing
American breakfast.

21:51.265 --> 21:53.233
<i>to win a coveted</i>
<i>white apron...</i>

21:53.233 --> 21:54.768
These aprons belong to...

21:54.768 --> 21:58.005
<i>...and a place</i>
<i>in the Top 20.</i>

21:58.005 --> 21:58.839

‐ Jenny.
‐ Paige.

22:00.173 --> 22:01.208
‐ Thank you.
‐ Sam.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.610
‐ Yes!
‐ Necco and Mark.

22:03.610 --> 22:05.312
‐ Oh.
‐ Well done.

22:05.312 --> 22:06.980
Yeah, baby!

22:06.980 --> 22:08.549
Whoo!

22:08.549 --> 22:10.651
( cheering )

22:10.651 --> 22:13.620
Announcer:
<i>Our next battle features</i>
<i>four talented home cooks</i>

22:13.620 --> 22:17.558
<i>all competing for</i>
<i>two MasterChef white aprons.</i>

22:17.558 --> 22:20.193
This is mine! My apron!

22:20.193 --> 22:22.796
Woman: <i>I'm Julia.</i>
<i>I am 22 years old,</i>

22:22.796 --> 22:25.299
and I have way more up my sleeve
than the other competitors.

22:25.299 --> 22:27.234
<i>I may look all‐American,</i>

22:27.234 --> 22:29.403
<i>but I have spent</i>
<i>a lot of time in China.</i>

22:29.403 --> 22:30.504
When you're cooking
with chopsticks,

22:30.504 --> 22:31.872
it's ten times more fun.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.907
<i>I've studied</i>
<i>the culture, the food.</i>

22:33.907 --> 22:36.977
I love to take classic dishes

22:36.977 --> 22:38.211
and put that
Asian twist on them.

22:38.211 --> 22:39.646
( chanting )
Adam! Adam!

22:39.646 --> 22:41.982
I'm gonna show 'em
what I got!

22:41.982 --> 22:44.318
‐ And I got a lot!
‐ ( cheering )

22:44.318 --> 22:46.019
Man: <i>My name's Adam,</i>
<i>I'm 21 years old,</i>

22:46.019 --> 22:47.554
and I'm a Harvard student.

22:47.554 --> 22:50.357
This is my dorm.
This is where the magic happens.

22:50.357 --> 22:53.160
This isn't a hobby for me.
This is a craft.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.261
Mm, skills.

22:54.261 --> 22:56.730
<i>If I was following</i>
<i>the script,</i>

22:56.730 --> 22:59.032
<i>I'd be getting ready</i>
<i>to take my first job</i>
<i>out of college.</i>

22:59.032 --> 23:00.867
I've completely
blown the lid off

23:00.867 --> 23:02.803
what the Harvard student
should be doing.

23:02.803 --> 23:04.371
( muttering )

23:04.371 --> 23:06.773
My name's Gabriel.
I'm 19 years old,

23:06.773 --> 23:08.141
<i>from Oklahoma City,</i>
<i>Oklahoma.</i>

23:08.141 --> 23:09.276
<i>When I got out of high school,</i>
<i>I thought,</i>

23:09.276 --> 23:10.877
"I should be going
to college right now,

23:10.877 --> 23:12.813
<i>but my parents are not</i>
<i>in the best of health."</i>

23:12.813 --> 23:14.615
<i>So I felt like</i>
<i>I needed to step up</i>

23:14.615 --> 23:17.150
and really spend my time
focusing on my family.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.186
<i>I've worked in</i>
<i>a Mexican fast food restaurant</i>
<i>for the past year.</i>

23:19.186 --> 23:20.621
<i>I don't make</i>
<i>a lot of money.</i>

23:20.621 --> 23:22.656
<i>I'm on the lower end</i>
<i>of every bit of income,</i>

23:22.656 --> 23:24.992
<i>so if I could become</i>
<i>the next MasterChef at 19,</i>

23:24.992 --> 23:27.294
<i>it would allow me to set</i>
<i>my parents up,</i>

23:27.294 --> 23:29.296
do something that would
better their lives.

23:30.831 --> 23:32.399
All right.
Come on down!

23:34.167 --> 23:36.803
Man: <i>My name is David,</i>
<i>I'm 50 years old,</i>

23:36.803 --> 23:38.071
and I'm a wedding singer.

23:38.071 --> 23:40.374
♪ It makes me
want to sing... ♪

23:40.374 --> 23:41.908
I'm gonna make
those judges wanna sing

23:41.908 --> 23:43.377
<i>after they taste my food.</i>

23:48.048 --> 23:50.183
Gordon:
Welcome, all four of you,
to the MasterChef kitchen.

23:50.183 --> 23:54.021
Adam, David,
Julia, Gabriel,

23:54.021 --> 23:58.425
for your battle,
you will all be making
a specialty of mine,

23:58.425 --> 24:01.428
a dish that you
can find in food trucks

24:01.428 --> 24:04.297
and even Michelin
star restaurants
around the world.

24:04.297 --> 24:05.198
I'm talking about...

24:16.727 --> 24:20.764
For your battle,
you will all be making
a specialty of mine.

24:20.764 --> 24:23.634
I'm talking about the humble,
the sensational...

24:26.737 --> 24:28.572
taco.

24:30.407 --> 24:32.776
Beef, fish,
shrimp, chicken‐‐

24:32.776 --> 24:34.778
the varieties are endless.

24:34.778 --> 24:36.079
Oh, yeah.

24:40.317 --> 24:42.452
You guys have 30 minutes

24:42.452 --> 24:45.455
to cook the most
memorable taco

24:45.455 --> 24:46.657
of your culinary lives.

24:46.657 --> 24:49.493
Your 30 minutes starts now.

24:54.865 --> 24:56.767
Adam, give us an insight
to the taco, please.

24:56.767 --> 24:59.036
Sure. Uh, the taco
that I'm making

24:59.036 --> 25:01.271
is spotted prawn tempura taco

25:01.271 --> 25:04.708
finished with a yuzu aioli,
topped with ikura salmon roe.

25:04.708 --> 25:07.544
Have you got what it takes
to become America's
next MasterChef?

25:07.544 --> 25:09.446
I am the most prepared.

25:09.446 --> 25:11.148
I go to Harvard University,

25:11.148 --> 25:13.050
which means that I think
it's pretty fair to say

25:13.050 --> 25:14.918
‐ that I'm one of the best
learners in this country.
‐ Good.

25:16.753 --> 25:18.655
‐ David?
‐ Yes, this is me.

25:18.655 --> 25:21.925
‐ What are you making?
‐ I'm making my spicy
Caribbean fish tacos.

25:21.925 --> 25:24.294
What I'm doing
is using a lot of produce
that we use in Jamaica,

25:24.294 --> 25:27.564
like scallion,
cabbage, avocado,

25:27.564 --> 25:30.133
and I'm just gonna try to
cohesively put them together

25:30.133 --> 25:32.002
and try to get a good look.

25:32.002 --> 25:33.770
Aarón: All right.
10 minutes are gone.

25:33.770 --> 25:36.106
20 minutes left.

25:36.106 --> 25:37.741
‐ Christina:
All right, Miss Julia.
‐ Yes, Chef?

25:37.741 --> 25:39.309
What are you making?

25:39.309 --> 25:40.944
Well, I lived
in China for two months

25:40.944 --> 25:44.114
and a lot of my food is
inspired by that Asian zest.

25:44.114 --> 25:47.651
So today I'm making
a Beijing crispy duck taco.

25:47.651 --> 25:50.921
All right, it's gonna
be tricky to get a crispy
skin on that duck,

25:50.921 --> 25:52.823
‐ get a lot of flavor in such
a short amount of time.
‐ That's the goal.

25:52.823 --> 25:55.359
‐ I'm gonna bring it.
‐ All right.

25:55.359 --> 25:57.361
‐ Gordon: Gabriel?
‐ Yes, Chef?

25:57.361 --> 25:59.763
19 years of age,
but it looks like
you've been in a kitchen

25:59.763 --> 26:01.531
for the last
10 years as a pro.

26:01.531 --> 26:02.566
What's the protein?

26:02.566 --> 26:04.067
Protein's tilapia, Chef.

26:04.067 --> 26:06.103
Which is a classic protein
inside taco.

26:06.103 --> 26:07.804
Well, Chef, I'm going
a little bit different.

26:07.804 --> 26:10.073
Instead of my salsa
being traditional or more
heat‐based, or anything,

26:10.073 --> 26:12.209
I'm going a little bit
fruit‐based.

26:12.209 --> 26:13.610
So I'm gonna go ahead
and do a mango peach salsa.

26:13.610 --> 26:15.379
Hopefully that sets me aside
enough from my competition.

26:15.379 --> 26:18.148
Great.
Guys, just under
five minutes.

26:22.152 --> 26:24.554
‐ Oh, God.
‐ Stay focused, okay?
Focus.

26:24.554 --> 26:27.224
Adam, look,
he's moving 'em too fast.

26:27.224 --> 26:29.626
He has to let 'em
cook a little bit.
Come on, pal.

26:29.626 --> 26:32.129
Christina:
I personally am a little
worried about Julia.

26:32.129 --> 26:34.898
Peking duck
is very different
than duck breast.

26:34.898 --> 26:36.233
I'm a little bit worried
about that texture

26:36.233 --> 26:38.769
going too far out
of what a taco can be.

26:38.769 --> 26:40.671
60 seconds remaining.
Let's go.

26:40.671 --> 26:42.439
Christina:
Come on, now, David.

26:42.439 --> 26:44.141
Gordon:
Start assembling
your tacos, please.

26:44.141 --> 26:45.776
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Four home cooks,

26:45.776 --> 26:48.745
two aprons,
30 seconds remain.

26:48.745 --> 26:50.781
‐ Let's go.
‐ Aarón: You're coming to
the finish line, guys.

26:50.781 --> 26:52.449
Are all your
garnishes there?

26:52.449 --> 26:54.685
Balance,
harmony in flavor.

26:54.685 --> 26:56.620
Gordon:
Julia, you've got to complete
those tacos. Come on.

26:56.620 --> 26:57.854
Come on, guys, here we go.

26:57.854 --> 27:01.625
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

27:01.625 --> 27:07.130
six, five, four,
three, two, one.

27:07.130 --> 27:10.133
‐ Gordon: And stop, guys.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

27:10.133 --> 27:12.536
Nice job.

27:12.536 --> 27:14.571
Okay, guys, very carefully

27:14.571 --> 27:16.807
bring those plates
of tacos forward.

27:21.378 --> 27:25.115
That was a tough,
fascinating battle.

27:25.115 --> 27:28.118
Right before you,
there's only two aprons.

27:28.118 --> 27:30.487
And the only way
that two of you guys

27:30.487 --> 27:32.456
walk out with those aprons

27:32.456 --> 27:34.925
is if we taste your tacos.

27:34.925 --> 27:38.061
‐ Adam, we'll start with you.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:38.061 --> 27:39.796
Explain to me
a little bit about
your taco.

27:39.796 --> 27:42.466
It's spot prawn
deep fried in tempura

27:42.466 --> 27:45.402
with a yuzu aioli,
topped off with red cabbage

27:45.402 --> 27:48.438
and ikura salmon roe.

27:48.438 --> 27:51.141
Look at that.
It's breaking up on me,

27:51.141 --> 27:51.975
which is a disappointment.

27:56.179 --> 27:57.748
Wow.

27:57.748 --> 28:00.617
The texture of that tempura,
beautiful.

28:00.617 --> 28:03.186
The dressing, light, airy.

28:03.186 --> 28:06.223
It has the right
amount of floral yuzu.

28:06.223 --> 28:09.092
I like the addition of the roe.
I think that was smart.

28:09.092 --> 28:12.696
But the tortilla?
Worst part of your dish.

28:16.566 --> 28:17.634
‐ All right, David.
‐ Yes, Chef.

28:17.634 --> 28:18.869
Talk me through
what I've got.

28:18.869 --> 28:21.238
My spicy Caribbean fish taco

28:21.238 --> 28:24.307
with cabbage, coleslaw,
red baby bell pepper,

28:24.307 --> 28:26.610
avocado, scallion,
a little bit of everything.

28:26.610 --> 28:29.112
And what's the binder
of that coleslaw?

28:29.112 --> 28:30.614
Mayonnaise, sour cream,

28:30.614 --> 28:32.883
and I squeezed
a little bit of lime in it.

28:32.883 --> 28:35.886
The fish is really crispy.
It's well‐seasoned.

28:35.886 --> 28:37.921
I think for the tortillas,
it looks like you had

28:37.921 --> 28:39.322
a little bit of a struggle

28:39.322 --> 28:41.892
with finding just the right
moisture in that masa,

28:41.892 --> 28:44.428
because I can see
some unbalanced edges.

28:44.428 --> 28:47.564
Being from the Caribbean,
your flavors are big
and bold and bright,

28:47.564 --> 28:50.467
and I would've loved just
a little bit more in that.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.769
Thank you.

28:52.769 --> 28:54.738
‐ Right, Julia.
‐ Yes, Chef.

28:54.738 --> 28:56.606
Describe
what we've got here.

28:56.606 --> 28:58.742
So, we have
a crispy duck taco,

28:58.742 --> 29:00.911
cantaloupe, dragon fruit,
serrano pepper,

29:00.911 --> 29:03.046
sesame oil, lime juice,

29:03.046 --> 29:05.248
and a crema with some
rice wine vinegar in there.

29:12.055 --> 29:14.691
Um, Julia,
just touch that for me.

29:14.691 --> 29:16.927
It's underdone.
It's definitely underdone.

29:16.927 --> 29:20.197
This is like eating
a raw mouthful of dough.

29:20.197 --> 29:22.732
Crispy duck needs
to be shredded fine‐‐

29:22.732 --> 29:25.435
virtually impossible
with such a lean duck breast.

29:25.435 --> 29:28.472
Love the seasoning.
Quite like that fruit
in there. Quite nice.

29:28.472 --> 29:31.374
The potential is there,
but that is not a showstopper.

29:31.374 --> 29:33.710
Thank you.

29:34.811 --> 29:37.080
‐ Gabriel?
‐ Yes, Chef.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.382
Explain to me
a little bit about
what you go here.

29:39.382 --> 29:41.651
So, I have a sweet and spicy
taco with blackened tilapia,

29:41.651 --> 29:43.653
some avocado crema,
a red cabbage slaw,

29:43.653 --> 29:45.989
and a mango
and peach salsa,

29:45.989 --> 29:47.491
finished off with a little bit
of cilantro and lime zest.

29:47.491 --> 29:50.260
All right,
so I gotta tell you,
it looks phenomenal.

29:50.260 --> 29:51.394
Thank you, Chef.

29:51.394 --> 29:52.762
Look at that knife work.

29:52.762 --> 29:55.332
Look at the thinness
of that tortilla.

29:58.935 --> 30:01.004
You have the nice dice
of the peach.

30:01.004 --> 30:03.673
It's refreshing, it's meaty.
It stands up to the tilapia.

30:03.673 --> 30:06.610
The crema,
cooling, herbaceous,

30:06.610 --> 30:08.245
makes you want
to have another bite.

30:08.245 --> 30:10.147
‐ Remind me your age.
‐ I'm 19, Chef.

30:10.147 --> 30:14.017
19. For you to do
that for me

30:14.017 --> 30:16.853
gives me hope
that what I chose
to do in my life

30:16.853 --> 30:19.589
is gonna be carried on
by the new generation.

30:19.589 --> 30:21.591
I appreciate that, Chef.
Thank you.

30:31.201 --> 30:32.936
All of you
did a fantastic job.

30:35.438 --> 30:38.108
But there's only two aprons.

30:38.108 --> 30:40.677
There's one
amateur home cook here

30:40.677 --> 30:43.680
who was far beyond
the other three.

30:45.182 --> 30:49.352
Gabriel,
please take that apron.

30:51.454 --> 30:53.523
Thank you, Chef.

30:53.523 --> 30:56.226
Good job, Gabriel.
Good job, buddy.

30:56.226 --> 30:58.628
Put that apron on.
Keep your head up.

30:58.628 --> 31:00.797
Yes, Chef.

31:00.797 --> 31:04.501
‐ Congratulations, young man.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

31:04.501 --> 31:06.303
I feel amazing.
You know, I'm 19,

31:06.303 --> 31:07.671
but I made it
to the Top 20.

31:07.671 --> 31:09.439
<i>It's a dream come true</i>
<i>because I knew</i>

31:09.439 --> 31:10.740
this is something
that I can pursue

31:10.740 --> 31:11.942
that would make
my parents proud,

31:11.942 --> 31:13.610
<i>and this will change my life</i>

31:13.610 --> 31:16.813
<i>by being able to change</i>
<i>the lives of people around me.</i>

31:16.813 --> 31:19.649
Three of you left,
one apron up for grabs.

31:19.649 --> 31:21.818
But one of you
has the flair,

31:21.818 --> 31:25.422
one of you has the skill.

31:25.422 --> 31:29.326
Three amazing tacos,
let's get that right.

31:29.326 --> 31:30.760
The final apron goes to...

31:35.098 --> 31:37.133
Congratulations.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.539
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Who's it gonna be?

31:44.774 --> 31:48.278
Oh! Yeah!

31:48.278 --> 31:49.679
Whoo‐hoo!

31:49.679 --> 31:52.983
So many people
want this thing,
and I got it.

31:52.983 --> 31:54.284
<i>I could be</i>
<i>at Harvard right now,</i>

32:15.212 --> 32:18.182
I'm a dentist by day,
and honestly I love what I do.

32:18.182 --> 32:19.416
We're gonna go
ahead and get started.

32:19.416 --> 32:23.453
<i>I really love my career,</i>
<i>but food is my passion.</i>

32:23.453 --> 32:25.489
‐ Boom!
‐ My whole life
I've been cooking

32:25.489 --> 32:28.292
‐ and eating quite a bit.
‐ ( laughs )

32:28.292 --> 32:29.493
This is sancocho.

32:29.493 --> 32:31.195
<i>I am Puerto Rican</i>
<i>and Dominican.</i>

32:31.195 --> 32:32.996
<i>We have a very big family,</i>

32:32.996 --> 32:34.898
and I've always been
in the kitchen with my mom

32:34.898 --> 32:37.067
<i>and aunts and grandparents.</i>

32:37.067 --> 32:39.469
<i>Food's always played</i>
<i>such a big role in my life.</i>

32:39.469 --> 32:41.572

‐ <i>I love my white coat.</i>

32:41.572 --> 32:43.307
<i>I wear it every day</i>
<i>into the office.</i>

32:43.307 --> 32:44.641
But I'm here to trade
that white coat in

32:44.641 --> 32:47.511
for a white apron.

32:47.511 --> 32:48.846
Announcer:

32:52.049 --> 32:53.851
Paola might
be sophisticated,

32:53.851 --> 32:55.586
but there ain't nothing
like country cooking.

32:55.586 --> 32:58.188
‐ Country girls are the best?
‐ Country girls are the best.

32:59.423 --> 33:01.425
Growing up in
a small town in Texas,

33:01.425 --> 33:02.593
<i>we grew up poor.</i>

33:02.593 --> 33:03.861
<i>So if you wanted chicken,</i>

33:03.861 --> 33:05.596
you go out to the yard,
you kill it.

33:05.596 --> 33:07.164
Remember when
y'all went hunting?

33:07.164 --> 33:08.498
Y'all didn't
bring anything back.
we didn't eat.

33:08.498 --> 33:09.967
That's it.
You go hunt your food,

33:09.967 --> 33:11.368
you bring it home,
you cook it up.

33:11.368 --> 33:14.671
<i>Squirrel, bullfrogs‐‐</i>
<i>food's food.</i>

33:14.671 --> 33:16.206
You get hungry enough,
you'll kill it and eat it.

33:16.206 --> 33:17.608
Y'all need to dig in!

33:17.608 --> 33:19.343
( bleep ) I ain't
gonna serve you.

33:19.343 --> 33:21.044
Yeah, we're country.

33:24.147 --> 33:25.682
( cheering )

33:29.152 --> 33:30.554
Reba:
<i>It's on like Donkey Kong.</i>

33:33.724 --> 33:35.058
<i>My competitor might think</i>

33:35.058 --> 33:36.960
<i>I'm a hillbilly</i>
<i>backwoods redneck,</i>

33:36.960 --> 33:39.296
but my food
is slap‐yo‐mama good.

33:41.298 --> 33:43.200
Ladies.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.536
Tonight in your battle,
you'll be making a dish

33:46.536 --> 33:49.907
using one of the most
sought‐after proteins
anywhere in the world.

33:49.907 --> 33:53.076
‐ Duck.
‐ Hell, yeah.

33:53.076 --> 33:55.913
I am about to show you
how to cook

33:55.913 --> 34:00.217
and render the fat
for the perfect duck breast.

34:00.217 --> 34:04.021
First off,
get your cast iron pan
piping hot.

34:04.021 --> 34:07.357
Now, take a really
sharp paring knife

34:07.357 --> 34:10.160
and score the duck breast.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.764
Use the tip of the knife
and come across
the duck breast.

34:13.764 --> 34:15.832
Turn the duck breast over,

34:15.832 --> 34:17.434
cut back across
the other way.

34:17.434 --> 34:20.671
Now, salt, pepper‐‐
both sides.

34:20.671 --> 34:22.639
Into the pan.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.341
We're not putting
any oil in there

34:24.341 --> 34:26.376
because we're gonna
cook the duck breast
in its own fat.

34:26.376 --> 34:28.645
Fresh rosemary,
touch of garlic,
slightly crushed.

34:28.645 --> 34:31.348
The salt now starts
to penetrate that fat,

34:31.348 --> 34:34.484
but more importantly,
we're getting it
really crispy.

34:34.484 --> 34:36.787
Sear the duck
all the way around‐‐

34:36.787 --> 34:38.989
the top, bottom,
and each side.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.624
That way the flavor
gets locked in.

34:40.624 --> 34:43.026
Skin side down,
into the pan.

34:43.026 --> 34:45.629
Into the oven for eight
to nine minutes.

34:45.629 --> 34:47.798
Now, out of the oven.

34:47.798 --> 34:50.200
The skin is nice and crispy,

34:50.200 --> 34:53.370
and the perfect
temperature for duck.

34:53.370 --> 34:55.739
Pink is absolutely spot on.

34:55.739 --> 34:59.376
And that is how you sear
and cook a duck breast

34:59.376 --> 35:02.312
like a true MasterChef.

35:04.614 --> 35:07.451
Ladies, in this battle,
you'll have 30 minutes

35:07.451 --> 35:10.821
to cook us
a fully‐composed duck dish.

35:10.821 --> 35:12.823
‐ You both ready?
‐ Yes, ma'am.

35:12.823 --> 35:15.993
Your 30 minutes starts... now!

35:22.032 --> 35:23.600
Right, Paola,
tell me about the dish.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.803
I am making a crispy‐skinned

35:26.803 --> 35:29.840
seared duck breast
over creamy farro,

35:29.840 --> 35:31.775
with vegetables tossed
in rendered duck fat

35:31.775 --> 35:34.344
with cherry
port wine reduction.

35:34.344 --> 35:36.146
I'm in the business
of making smiles, right?

35:36.146 --> 35:40.150
So hopefully this dish
will be putting a smile on
all you guys' faces.

35:41.885 --> 35:43.186
‐ Reba.
‐ Yes, sir.

35:43.186 --> 35:44.721
Tell us about the duck dish.

35:44.721 --> 35:48.525
The sauce is a wild mushroom
red wine reduction

35:48.525 --> 35:51.361
with Brussels sprouts,
candied pecan on top of it,

35:51.361 --> 35:53.663
and we gonna throw you down
some taters on there.

35:53.663 --> 35:55.565
‐ Some what, sorry?
‐ Some taters.

35:55.565 --> 35:57.334
‐ What are they?
‐ Potatoes.

35:57.334 --> 35:58.969
‐ Oh, potatoes.
‐ We call 'em "taters."

36:00.404 --> 36:01.671
Aarón:
All right, ladies,

36:01.671 --> 36:03.273
seven minutes
before one of you

36:03.273 --> 36:06.443
gets her hands on that
very elusive apron.

36:06.443 --> 36:09.146
I hate to see you go,
but I'm gonna love
watching you leave.

36:11.281 --> 36:13.750
Two complete
opposite individuals,

36:13.750 --> 36:15.752
but cooking
the same interpretation.

36:15.752 --> 36:17.954
And it'll show
in those dishes.

36:17.954 --> 36:21.491
Ladies, we have
60 seconds remaining.

36:21.491 --> 36:22.659
Christina:
All right now.

36:22.659 --> 36:24.928
Come on, guys, this is it.
Final push.

36:24.928 --> 36:27.531
One apron up for grabs.
Let's go.

36:27.531 --> 36:29.666
‐ Mm.
‐ Ten...

36:29.666 --> 36:33.270
Judges:
Nine, eight, seven, six,

36:33.270 --> 36:37.941
five, four,
three, two, one.

36:37.941 --> 36:40.143
‐ And stop.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

36:40.143 --> 36:41.878
Well done.

36:48.385 --> 36:49.820
Ladies, well done.

36:49.820 --> 36:53.023
Two duck dishes,
both with individual styles.

36:53.023 --> 36:55.959
Tonight, only one apron
is up for grabs,

36:55.959 --> 36:59.629
and one spot inside
the MasterChef kitchen.

37:01.631 --> 37:06.002
Paola, at face value,
it's a gorgeous dish.
Tell me about it.

37:06.002 --> 37:09.940
What I have made for you
is a seared duck breast

37:09.940 --> 37:12.509
over creamy farro
with spring peas,

37:12.509 --> 37:14.077
heirloom carrots,
and pearl onion,

37:14.077 --> 37:16.680
tossed in that
rendered duck fat,

37:16.680 --> 37:19.683
and then a tart cherry
port wine reduction sauce.

37:19.683 --> 37:20.951
What am I looking
for color‐wise?

37:20.951 --> 37:23.587
You're gonna be getting
a pinkish color,

37:23.587 --> 37:25.655
hopefully,
right in that middle.

37:25.655 --> 37:27.858
Let's see what you got.

37:29.025 --> 37:30.160
That's pretty beautiful.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.828
Thank you.

37:36.700 --> 37:39.836
The duck is juicy,
seasoned pretty well.

37:39.836 --> 37:42.539
I think that the sauce
on the outside is beautiful.

37:42.539 --> 37:45.142
There's a nice buttery
richness to that farro,

37:45.142 --> 37:46.843
but it's a little underdone.

37:46.843 --> 37:47.878
Okay.

37:50.313 --> 37:51.148
Gordon:
Right, Paola.

37:55.986 --> 37:59.222
Under there,
there's still a touch
of white fat.

37:59.222 --> 38:01.858
So duck could've been
at least another three
or four minutes

38:01.858 --> 38:03.493
skin side down in the pan.
It won't overcook,

38:03.493 --> 38:05.262
it will just‐‐
the fat will render out.

38:05.262 --> 38:07.330
And when you've got
baby carrots,

38:07.330 --> 38:09.232
the best in the world
that are hours old,

38:09.232 --> 38:10.433
they taste incredible.

38:10.433 --> 38:11.668
They don't need
the help of duck fat.

38:11.668 --> 38:13.603
Noted.

38:13.603 --> 38:15.272
However, presentation
skills is like you.

38:15.272 --> 38:17.741
It's articulate and pretty,
and the plate looks stunning.

38:17.741 --> 38:20.443
Unfortunately, it doesn't
taste as good as it looks.

38:20.443 --> 38:21.578
Okay.

38:23.813 --> 38:26.583
Reba, describe
the dish, please.

38:26.583 --> 38:30.453
You've got a pan‐seared duck
over Brussels sprouts

38:30.453 --> 38:32.022
and some fresh taters,

38:32.022 --> 38:35.358
along with wild mushroom
wine reduction sauce.

38:35.358 --> 38:37.194
There's the frustrating part,

38:37.194 --> 38:39.796
the beautiful color
you got on that duck.

38:39.796 --> 38:42.766
And then you destroy it
with that sauce on top.

38:42.766 --> 38:44.701
Texas likes gravy.

38:46.536 --> 38:50.173
It's slicing like butter.

38:50.173 --> 38:52.342
Yep, that is beautiful.

38:52.342 --> 38:54.978
It's pink
and it's glistening.

38:54.978 --> 38:57.314
What'd you season
the duck with?

38:57.314 --> 39:00.383
Salt and pepper, sir.

39:00.383 --> 39:02.619
And the duck
tastes incredible.

39:02.619 --> 39:03.987
‐ Thank you, sir.
‐ It's exceptional.

39:03.987 --> 39:07.090
Mashed potatoes are fine,
but a little bit lumpy.

39:07.090 --> 39:10.560
The thing is, I close my eyes
and it tastes beautifully,

39:10.560 --> 39:12.295
but it just looks a mess.

39:13.897 --> 39:15.665
Aarón: Miss Reba.

39:18.935 --> 39:21.638
‐ Your duck is fantastic.
‐ Thank you, sir.

39:21.638 --> 39:23.573
I really love that
aggressive seasoning

39:23.573 --> 39:24.774
on the outside of that duck.

39:24.774 --> 39:26.776
And the gravy? Wonderful.

39:26.776 --> 39:28.912
That earthiness
from the mushroom
really shines through.

39:28.912 --> 39:30.580
Yes, there's
some plating issues,

39:30.580 --> 39:32.415
there's some technical flaws,

39:32.415 --> 39:34.017
but that is a pleasant bite.

39:34.017 --> 39:35.752
Thank you, sir.

39:40.023 --> 39:43.693
Okay, so, they both
did a great job
of cooking the duck.

39:43.693 --> 39:46.529
Aarón: Which one has
more potential?

39:46.529 --> 39:48.164
This is tough.

39:53.136 --> 39:56.673
Uh, ladies,
you're both so good

39:56.673 --> 39:59.776
that you both deserve
to go through.

39:59.776 --> 40:03.680
But, unfortunately,
this is a competition
and rules are rules.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.448
( Gordon sighs )

40:05.448 --> 40:08.885
This apron goes
to the individual

40:08.885 --> 40:12.856
that I think can mature
across this competition

40:12.856 --> 40:16.359
and become
a true MasterChef.

40:18.461 --> 40:19.896
This apron belongs to...

40:21.831 --> 40:24.534
( sighs )

40:29.472 --> 40:32.709
‐ Come on, honey. Come on.
‐ ( cheering )

40:35.011 --> 40:36.680
Yes!

40:40.817 --> 40:42.352
Come on!

40:44.421 --> 40:46.690
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Come on, Texas!

40:46.690 --> 40:50.760
If it's this good now
before the top twenty,

40:50.760 --> 40:52.929
we're in for
a season and a half.

40:52.929 --> 40:55.865
( cheering )

40:55.865 --> 40:58.568
Reba did win it today.
She brought her A‐game,

40:58.568 --> 41:02.205
and that's not
gonna discourage me
from continuing on.

41:02.205 --> 41:04.507
That doesn't mean
that I'm not gonna be back
in that kitchen someday.

41:04.507 --> 41:07.444
Honey child! Yeah!

41:07.444 --> 41:09.612
Paola gave me
a run for my money,

41:09.612 --> 41:12.349
but this country girl's
like a flea on the back
of a coon dog.

41:12.349 --> 41:13.616
We ain't going nowhere.

41:13.616 --> 41:15.452
Good job.

41:17.987 --> 41:19.322
Announcer:
