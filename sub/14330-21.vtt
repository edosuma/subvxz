Thanks for baby-sitting
tonight, Vicky,

01:37.055 --> 01:38.056
Timmy just loves
making new friends,

01:38.139 --> 01:39.098
don't you, Timmy?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.518
(Vicky)
No problem, Mr. Turner!

01:41.976 --> 01:43.102
I just love, Timmy.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.188
We're gonna be best pals!

01:46.272 --> 01:46.940
Right, Timmy?

01:51.903 --> 01:52.654
Bye!

01:55.406 --> 01:55.448
(door creaking)

01:57.116 --> 01:58.076
All right, squirt.

01:58.326 --> 01:58.952
Three things,

01:59.035 --> 02:00.161
one: stay out of my way,

02:00.245 --> 02:01.704
two: go to bed early,

02:01.788 --> 02:03.122
three: do the dishes.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.083
Mom told you to do 'em.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.709
Oh, yeah.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.086
{\an1}Well, you wouldn't
want her to find this...

02:09.169 --> 02:10.797
magazine, would ya?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.131
That's not mine!

02:12.465 --> 02:14.300
Mom will never believe you!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.261
(laughs)
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.929
It works great at my house.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.430
Just ask my little brother.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.890
(clicking buttons)

Ok! Ok!

02:23.476 --> 02:24.477
I'll do it!

02:24.727 --> 02:25.436
Excellent...

02:25.520 --> 02:26.771
and as your reward,

02:27.021 --> 02:29.315
how about I order
pizza for us?

02:29.858 --> 02:30.191
(TV playing music)

02:30.275 --> 02:31.484
Ok,

02:31.568 --> 02:32.277

Good! You're awake!

02:59.679 --> 03:01.055
Wouldn't want you
to miss your bedtime!

03:01.139 --> 03:03.057
But I'm not tired.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.142
Oh, well,

03:04.225 --> 03:06.185
{\an1}we could watch your favorite
television show...

03:06.269 --> 03:07.478
"The world of lip-gloss."

03:07.562 --> 03:08.438
It's on the make-up channel.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.523
That's your favorite show.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.026
Oh, so it is.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.444
(laughing maniacally)

03:16.905 --> 03:18.907
Very funny!

Oh, magic nine ball,

03:22.243 --> 03:24.454
when will my parents
get back from the movies?

03:25.371 --> 03:26.122
"Titanic"?

03:26.414 --> 03:27.165
Director's cut?!

03:27.707 --> 03:29.167
They'll be there all night!

03:29.542 --> 03:30.168
Man!

03:30.460 --> 03:31.002
That's dumb!

03:34.005 --> 03:36.174
(whirring)

03:36.716 --> 03:37.967

Hey, Timmy!

03:38.551 --> 03:39.719
I'm Cosmo!

03:39.802 --> 03:40.720
I'm Wanda!

03:40.803 --> 03:41.387
(both)
And we're...

03:43.014 --> 03:45.058
your fairy godparents!

03:47.185 --> 03:48.227
Whaddya think, Timmy?

03:49.228 --> 03:50.897
I think I'm callin' the cops.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.231
(Wanda)
Hold it, tiger!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.566
(alarm ringing)

03:54.025 --> 03:55.610
You can't tell anyone about us!

03:55.693 --> 03:56.527
If you do,

03:56.611 --> 03:58.154
we'll just go away forever.

03:58.237 --> 03:58.780
Why?

03:59.238 --> 04:00.698
That's what the rulebook says.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.826
Whoops. Sorry.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.453
There's lots of rules, Timmy!

04:06.245 --> 04:07.330
Why are you here?

04:07.580 --> 04:08.164
We want to help you!

04:08.247 --> 04:08.706
We're magic!

04:08.790 --> 04:10.249
Oooh!

04:10.583 --> 04:11.250
Magic!

04:11.334 --> 04:11.793
Oooh!

04:11.876 --> 04:13.044
We grant wishes!

04:13.127 --> 04:14.003
(giggling)

04:14.921 --> 04:15.713
What's going on in here?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.173
Nothing.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.132
(Vicky)
What's with the fish?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.010
Uh, those are my godfish,

04:21.678 --> 04:22.262
goldfish!

04:22.762 --> 04:23.763
Fish are riddled with germs.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.224
I wouldn't want you
getting sick.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.809
Maybe I should flush 'em!

04:27.892 --> 04:28.476
No!

04:28.559 --> 04:29.769
Should we do something?

04:30.269 --> 04:31.229
Well, he's got to
wish for it first!

04:31.312 --> 04:32.188
Oh, I hate that rule.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.606
I'm calling a union meeting.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.525
{\an1}I want these
disgusting creatures

04:35.608 --> 04:36.275
out of here,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.194
or it's toilet time
for the two of them!

04:38.528 --> 04:39.112
(slams door)

04:39.529 --> 04:40.446
Sweet girl.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.698
I love her fangs.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.366
You grant wishes, huh?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.158
Sure do!

04:44.701 --> 04:47.245
{\an1}And we love clients
with creative imaginations!

04:47.745 --> 04:48.621
Then I wish for one thing...

04:49.956 --> 04:50.790
gelatin.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.167
(sighs)

04:53.626 --> 04:53.668
(pops)

04:56.337 --> 04:57.422
(shrieks)

04:57.672 --> 04:58.756
You always were great
with dessert!

04:58.840 --> 05:01.134
(laughing)

05:01.509 --> 05:02.552
Whipped cream!

05:04.137 --> 05:04.846
Cherry!

05:08.141 --> 05:09.350
That's great!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.185
Can you make her into
a giant chocolate shake?

05:11.269 --> 05:13.104
Ooh, may I, Pookie?

05:13.187 --> 05:13.646
Of course, Stallion!

05:16.774 --> 05:17.567
(roars)

05:17.942 --> 05:19.110

05:21.112 --> 05:22.613
Not chocolate snake!

05:22.697 --> 05:24.073
I gotta get this thing fixed.

05:27.618 --> 05:28.995
Timmy! Wish for something.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.205
I wish she was a fly!

05:34.876 --> 05:35.668

05:48.514 --> 05:49.640
Anything else, Timmy?

05:49.724 --> 05:50.767
Here's a wish list.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.185
(both)
Oooh.

05:53.102 --> 05:53.811
You can't do this to me!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.521
I'm the baby sitter!

05:57.023 --> 05:58.357
Goo. Goo.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.193
{\an1}That's the first time the baby
ever sat on the sitter!

06:00.568 --> 06:01.694
(crying)
Help!

06:02.111 --> 06:03.613
Sorry, the secret word was pie.

06:04.906 --> 06:05.782
(shrieks)

06:15.875 --> 06:16.542
Yikes!

06:16.626 --> 06:17.585
(shooting)

06:19.462 --> 06:20.088
The force is strong
with this one!

06:20.171 --> 06:21.297
"I am your father"

06:21.380 --> 06:23.341
I've always wanted to say that!

06:23.674 --> 06:25.301
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.142
(shrieks)

06:33.559 --> 06:34.727
Well, Vicky.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.394
Any last words?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.896
(train approaching)

06:37.772 --> 06:39.565
Woo, woo, baby! Woo, woo!

06:39.899 --> 06:40.650
Well?

06:40.733 --> 06:41.859
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

06:41.943 --> 06:42.985
Stop! I'll do anything...

06:43.736 --> 06:44.654
anything!

06:44.737 --> 06:45.988
(Mr. Turner)
Vicky! Vicky?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.826
Looks like you were
having a bad dream!

06:50.076 --> 06:51.577
Maybe too much pizza?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.412
{\an5}(Mrs. Turner)
Why don't we
drive you home now?

06:53.496 --> 06:53.913
Uh?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.414
Sure, uh--

06:55.498 --> 06:56.541
(Timmy)
Oh, Vicky!

06:56.958 --> 06:58.835
Remember, you promised
to hand wash all my laundry?

06:58.918 --> 07:02.630
{\an1}After all, mom, she did such
a great job on the dishes.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.756
Of course, dear.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.049
Laundry?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.592
Why you little-- Uh--

07:08.427 --> 07:09.679
Laundry!

07:09.762 --> 07:11.764
Sure! I'll do your laundry!

07:12.223 --> 07:13.099
I don't know what's
going on around here,

07:13.474 --> 07:16.018
but I'm gonna find out.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.353
See ya, Vicky.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.272
{\an1}Hey, mom,
Vicky's the best friend ever!

07:19.605 --> 07:21.440
Can she baby-sit all the time?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.817
(Mrs. Turner)
Of course, dear.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.819
{\an1}Looks like
we'll be here a while.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.112
Well, at least we'll be clean.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.322
(laughing)

07:29.282 --> 07:29.991
(indistinct)

07:33.911 --> 07:35.872
(Narrator)
The Iron Lung!

07:36.330 --> 07:37.206
The wind-themed bad guy

07:37.290 --> 07:38.457
was using his mighty

07:38.541 --> 07:41.752
sucking and blowing powers...

07:42.503 --> 07:44.630
to blow out the candle
on the city's

07:44.714 --> 07:46.674
giant birthday cake.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.509
And blow the cake

07:48.593 --> 07:49.635
and our heroes

07:50.011 --> 07:52.471
toward the statue of
Chincinnati!

07:52.722 --> 07:54.056
Is the big green lady

07:54.140 --> 07:55.808
about to get a second chin?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.226
We'll be back to find out,

07:57.310 --> 07:57.602
right after this!

07:59.395 --> 08:00.188
(Narrator)
The Iron Lung

08:00.271 --> 08:00.813
blew out the candle,

08:01.105 --> 08:01.898
now will he get his wish,

08:02.398 --> 08:05.234
then the end of our heroes?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.111
The Chin would be crushed.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.780
Cleft would be squashed,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.240
and Mrs. Chincinnati

08:11.324 --> 08:13.201
would be pulverized...

08:13.618 --> 08:14.911
which meant
the first runner-up,

08:14.994 --> 08:16.287
Mrs. Chincinnati

08:16.370 --> 08:18.706
would have to assume her duties.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.124
Whatever those are.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.501
"I'll take the cake, Cleft,"

08:22.585 --> 08:23.502
said the Chin.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.087
"And I'll break the wind,"

08:25.171 --> 08:26.881
replied Cleft.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.629
Hmm, dignity?

09:06.879 --> 09:08.839
I have no idea

09:53.759 --> 09:55.136
Don't be nervous, Timmy.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.930
I won't require much care.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.266

10:01.100 --> 10:02.393
Oh, Timmy!

10:03.602 --> 10:05.021
Ah! Excellent!

10:05.104 --> 10:06.897

10:41.557 --> 10:43.351
Yeah, did you lose a bet?

10:43.601 --> 10:46.312
No, mom and dad told me
to take care of Vicky.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.647
Now she's got me waiting
on her hand and foot!

10:48.898 --> 10:50.232
But I'm just one kid!

10:50.316 --> 10:51.317
I can't do it all!

10:51.859 --> 10:52.818
Hey! That's it!

10:52.902 --> 10:54.403
I'll be more than one kid!

Ok, you guys!

No problemo!

10:58.532 --> 10:59.617
How many would you like?

11:00.034 --> 11:00.117
A ton!

11:02.828 --> 11:05.539
The rulebook says
a ton is 2,000 pounds.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.166
How much do you weigh?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.668
45 pounds, all muscle.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.879
Hmm. 45 divided

12:15.151 --> 12:16.318
Well, I'm obviously here.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.445
Looks like you're a lot
sicker than you thought.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.363

Spin the bottle.

Tootie! I need
sauerkraut now!
