WEBVTT

00:01.437 --> 00:03.029
I get Ava Hessington acquitted,

00:03.438 --> 00:05.106
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

00:05.190 --> 00:07.775
I don't want it anymore.
Get out of my sight.

00:07.859 --> 00:09.560
You called Mariga
to offer him a bribe.

00:09.611 --> 00:10.745
Doesn't matter--
Danny should never have

00:10.829 --> 00:11.829
had him in the first place.

00:11.896 --> 00:12.863
But he does now.

00:12.915 --> 00:15.082
You're saying
he traced my call.

00:15.167 --> 00:18.085
You're suing me for ownership
of the Mikado?

00:18.170 --> 00:20.237
He said he might as well
have left his cat

00:20.289 --> 00:22.340
with Michael Vick.

00:22.407 --> 00:23.874
I'm offering you
a settlement.

00:23.926 --> 00:27.178
He get back the associates,
I get back my cat.

00:27.245 --> 00:28.879
Clifford Danner is 18.

00:28.931 --> 00:31.682
I put him in jail 12 years ago.
He's innocent.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.916
Cameron buried the evidence.

00:32.968 --> 00:34.769
Emmanuel Mariga,
20 years ago

00:34.853 --> 00:37.221
at the University of Cape Town
on the rugby team.

00:37.272 --> 00:39.190
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

00:39.257 --> 00:41.025
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

00:41.092 --> 00:42.777
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

00:46.281 --> 00:47.698
Aah!

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.458 --> 00:58.876
Tell me he looks worse.

00:58.943 --> 01:01.996
He does.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.298
Are you hurt?

01:04.382 --> 01:06.167
No, I'm fine.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.388
I hope you didn't do that
because of me.

01:10.455 --> 01:13.557
It was a fight, Donna,
not a duel.

01:15.260 --> 01:18.929
- How could I not have--
- Listen to me.

01:18.981 --> 01:21.799
Stephen betrayed us all.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.434
You don't understand,
Harvey.

01:23.485 --> 01:26.637
I was with him.

01:26.688 --> 01:28.773
And he was capable
of something like that,

01:28.824 --> 01:30.191
and I didn't even see it.

01:30.275 --> 01:32.610
You know, I'm supposed to--
Donna!

01:34.646 --> 01:36.313
It's okay.

01:36.365 --> 01:38.866
Just tell me
you're gonna make him pay.

01:38.950 --> 01:42.203
He'll pay.

01:50.629 --> 01:53.464
Let's not talk about it.

01:53.515 --> 01:56.517
Talk about what?

01:56.601 --> 01:58.302
What do you need me to do?

01:58.353 --> 01:59.970
I need you to keep going
with everything you have

02:00.022 --> 02:01.505
to impeach
Mariga's testimony.

02:01.556 --> 02:02.690
What about the stuff
on Stephen?

02:02.774 --> 02:04.508
- Not yet.
- Why not?

02:04.559 --> 02:05.893
Because we don't have proof.

02:05.977 --> 02:07.028
The trial's in two days.

02:07.112 --> 02:08.229
We should bring Ava in
and tell her--

02:08.312 --> 02:09.229
- Not yet.
- Why not?

02:09.314 --> 02:10.281
Because we don't have proof.

02:10.348 --> 02:11.588
Harvey, we have
to do something.

02:11.650 --> 02:13.011
And how would
that conversation go?

02:13.017 --> 02:15.119
"Hi, Ava, turns out
one of the lawyers from our firm

02:15.186 --> 02:16.954
"is trying to frame you
for a crime he committed.

02:17.021 --> 02:19.356
But right now we're not sure
we can do anything about it."

02:19.408 --> 02:20.958
What are you gonna do?

02:21.025 --> 02:22.526
I'm gonna go home,
get a good night's sleep,

02:22.577 --> 02:23.744
and then tomorrow
I'm gonna find out

02:23.829 --> 02:24.912
what the whole story is.

02:24.996 --> 02:26.396
Harvey, Stephen
isn't gonna tell you

02:26.415 --> 02:27.715
what the whole story is.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.200
No, but there's
someone else who can.

02:32.337 --> 02:34.204
You knew this case
was heading your way

02:34.256 --> 02:35.589
before you ever
came after us.

02:35.674 --> 02:37.174
That's why
you wanted to merge.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.426
Yes, it is.

02:38.510 --> 02:40.270
And I regret the situation
as much as you do.

02:40.312 --> 02:41.729
But what's done is done.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.814
Is that what you told Stephen
when you found out he did it?

02:43.882 --> 02:44.982
Found out?

02:45.049 --> 02:46.600
How do we know
he didn't order it?

02:46.685 --> 02:48.385
Because I am giving you
my word.

02:48.437 --> 02:50.571
Why should we trust a man
who sent Stephen over here

02:50.655 --> 02:52.073
to cover his ass?

02:52.157 --> 02:55.526
I sent Stephen over here
because I care about Ava,

02:55.577 --> 02:58.228
which is why I sent him to
the E.I.R. in the first place.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.581
I had no idea
he would do what he did,

03:00.665 --> 03:02.800
and I have been trying
to fix it ever since.

03:02.868 --> 03:05.169
- Then fix it right now.
- And how exactly can I do that?

03:05.237 --> 03:06.804
By stating in court

03:06.872 --> 03:09.206
Stephen acted alone
without Ava's knowledge.

03:09.274 --> 03:10.841
- I can't.
- Why not?

03:10.909 --> 03:12.293
Because he never told me.

03:12.377 --> 03:15.346
And you never asked because
you never wanted to know.

03:15.413 --> 03:17.181
You piece of shit.

03:17.248 --> 03:19.100
You care about Ava
so much.

03:19.184 --> 03:21.084
How could you
do this to her?

03:21.136 --> 03:23.304
I wasn't doing anything
to her.

03:23.388 --> 03:25.756
I was trying to do
something for her.

03:25.807 --> 03:29.126
Remind me never to ask you
for any favors.

03:29.194 --> 03:31.028
Well, I'm not asking
for a favor.

03:31.095 --> 03:33.447
But you are going to agree
to do something right now.

03:33.532 --> 03:36.317
And what is that?

03:44.576 --> 03:47.128
It's not gonna work.

03:47.212 --> 03:50.131
I cut you off
to get your attention.

03:52.283 --> 03:54.051
Well, you have it.

03:54.118 --> 03:57.004
Good, 'cause I just have
one question for you.

03:57.088 --> 03:58.923
How can you live
with yourself?

03:58.974 --> 04:00.758
- What?
- You know what?

04:00.809 --> 04:02.176
I don't have any questions
for you.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.294
I just came in here to let
you know that you make me sick.

04:04.346 --> 04:06.897
Obviously
I hurt you, Donna,

04:06.965 --> 04:08.983
and I never meant
to do that.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.401
Oh, you didn't hurt me.

04:10.468 --> 04:12.570
You just made me somebody
who slept with a murderer.

04:12.637 --> 04:15.356
Murderer?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.358
I don't know
what you think you know,

04:17.442 --> 04:20.494
but those people that
were killed were terrorists.

04:20.579 --> 04:21.745
They were people...

04:21.813 --> 04:23.480
Who lived on top
of something that you wanted.

04:23.532 --> 04:26.333
People who had guns--
murderers, Donna.

04:26.418 --> 04:28.752
Now, if you're so appalled
by how business is done,

04:28.820 --> 04:30.254
may I suggest
that you return

04:30.321 --> 04:33.340
all of your designer clothes
that you look so ravishing in,

04:33.425 --> 04:35.176
because they're paid for

04:35.260 --> 04:37.294
by the dirty work
this firm does.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.679
We don't kill people.

04:38.763 --> 04:41.131
You mean chemical companies
that Harvey represents

04:41.183 --> 04:43.217
or car companies
that Harvey defends?

04:43.301 --> 04:47.021
How about insurance providers
whose claims he helps deny?

04:47.105 --> 04:50.173
- Don't bring him into this.
- He's always been in this.

04:50.225 --> 04:52.059
You know what?
I've had enough of this.

04:52.143 --> 04:54.778
I didn't really cut off your
shit to get your attention.

04:54.846 --> 04:58.949
I cut it off because
you don't need it anymore.

04:59.017 --> 05:00.367
You're fired.

05:01.686 --> 05:03.621
Harvey
would never allow that.

2 months, 5 days, and 3 hours
under Nigel's tutelage,

05:47.941 --> 05:49.542
and this is what
you have to show for it?

05:49.737 --> 05:51.655
That's over 20 motions.

05:51.739 --> 05:52.989
20 dog shits.

05:53.074 --> 05:54.791
Did you get this
out of a Grisham novel?

05:54.876 --> 05:56.109
Because that's fiction.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.828
And you...

05:57.912 --> 06:00.130
My mother can get
this motion thrown out.

06:00.214 --> 06:02.115
And you--well, you're gone
anyway in two days.

06:02.166 --> 06:03.250
Listen up, people.

06:03.301 --> 06:06.503
I've reviewed your work
in my absence.

06:06.587 --> 06:08.305
And guess what.

06:08.389 --> 06:09.789
It's pathetic.

06:09.841 --> 06:13.009
Every stinking one of you
should get down on your knees

06:13.094 --> 06:14.511
and thank God and me

06:14.595 --> 06:16.963
for letting you continue
to exist in our kingdoms.

06:20.134 --> 06:22.152
Louis, what was that about?
What's going on?

06:22.236 --> 06:23.636
It was about me letting
these assholes know

06:23.688 --> 06:25.638
who's in charge.
They know you're in charge.

06:25.690 --> 06:28.408
They put you in charge.
They didn't put me in shit.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.527
They sat there in judgment while
my character got ripped apart,

06:30.611 --> 06:32.812
and not one of them
lifted a single finger to help.

06:32.864 --> 06:35.365
They ruled in your favor.
They chose you over Nigel.

06:35.449 --> 06:39.819
No, they made me
give up Mikado for them.

06:39.871 --> 06:44.090
Okay, you're displacing your
anger over Mikado onto them.

06:44.158 --> 06:47.377
They didn't put you
in this position.

06:47.461 --> 06:48.879
It's not fair.

06:48.963 --> 06:50.046
You're right.

06:50.131 --> 06:52.832
They didn't put me
in this position,

06:52.884 --> 06:53.967
but I know who did.

06:54.018 --> 06:55.385
Goddamn Darby--

06:55.469 --> 06:57.429
unleashes his dog, leaves us
to clean up the mess.

06:57.438 --> 06:58.805
We can still go after Mariga
in court.

06:58.856 --> 07:00.173
I mean,
he's an admitted murderer

07:00.224 --> 07:01.691
who cut a deal
to save his life.

07:01.776 --> 07:03.026
Wait a second.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.778
That deal is only good
if he's telling the truth.

07:04.845 --> 07:06.813
We can't go after him
with the truth on the stand.

07:06.864 --> 07:10.016
Maybe, but we can go after him
with the truth not on the stand.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.018
Cameron would have
to be willing to listen.

07:12.069 --> 07:13.403
Then I better
get him to listen.

07:13.487 --> 07:14.788
And I better
go after Mariga.

07:14.855 --> 07:16.856
- And change your clothes.
- What? Why?

07:16.908 --> 07:18.992
If they see a lawyer
within 20 yards of that lobby,

07:19.043 --> 07:21.527
they'll lock the place down.

07:53.778 --> 07:56.830
- Oh, you're not room service.
- No, I'm not, but...

07:56.897 --> 07:58.865
I do need to talk
to Colonel Mariga.

07:58.916 --> 08:01.534
And I need to stop paying
alimony to my cheating ex-wife,

08:01.585 --> 08:03.403
but that's not going
to happen.

08:03.454 --> 08:04.955
If you let me in,
maybe I can make that happen.

08:05.039 --> 08:07.674
And how the hell are you
gonna make that happen?

08:07.741 --> 08:10.510
I'm a lawyer.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.045
You don't look like
a lawyer to me.

08:12.096 --> 08:13.246
Okay. All right.
You got me.

08:13.297 --> 08:15.598
Look, I'm not--
I'm not a lawyer.

08:15.683 --> 08:17.934
In fact, between you and me,
I'm a complete fraud.

08:18.019 --> 08:21.021
But what I am
is Colonel Mariga's cousin.

08:23.757 --> 08:25.692
On his mother's side.

08:25.759 --> 08:26.776
- All right.
- Okay, all right!

08:26.861 --> 08:27.978
All right,
you don't believe me?

08:28.062 --> 08:30.730
That's fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

08:30.781 --> 08:33.033
Give him this photo
of him and my Uncle Stephen.

08:35.285 --> 08:38.455
Then let him decide
if he wants to talk to me.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.991
Louis, how did you
get in here?

08:41.075 --> 08:42.292
I told them
I was your uncle.

08:42.376 --> 08:43.659
Though how they could believe
that we share

08:43.744 --> 08:44.828
the same DNA is beyond me.

08:44.912 --> 08:47.163
This is about your trial,
isn't it?

08:47.248 --> 08:48.288
You're goddamn right
it is!

08:48.299 --> 08:49.382
Why the hell
would you do that to me?

08:49.450 --> 08:51.134
I had no choice.
I was subpoenaed.

08:51.218 --> 08:54.287
It was a mock trial.
You could have refused.

08:54.338 --> 08:55.588
What do you want
from me, Louis?

08:55.639 --> 08:56.956
I want to yell at you!

08:57.008 --> 08:58.525
Well, you can't do that
anymore--you fired me.

08:58.592 --> 09:00.060
Is that what this
whole thing was all about?

09:00.127 --> 09:02.262
You're damn right it was.
And you want to know the truth?

09:02.313 --> 09:03.980
When I found out
about your stupid trial,

09:04.065 --> 09:05.465
I called Nigel
and volunteered.

09:05.516 --> 09:07.300
How dare you?

09:07.351 --> 09:09.402
Me firing you was business.

09:09.470 --> 09:11.321
You bringing up the death
of my cat--

09:11.405 --> 09:12.822
that was personal.

09:12.907 --> 09:14.824
You made me take care
of that stupid cat.

09:14.909 --> 09:16.826
I'm allergic.
It could have killed me.

09:16.911 --> 09:18.328
And when that cat did die,

09:18.412 --> 09:20.830
not only did you never tell me
that it wasn't my fault,

09:20.915 --> 09:23.649
you then fired me
in front of my very best friend.

09:23.701 --> 09:26.586
If that's not personal,
then I don't know what is.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.922
Now get the hell
out of my office.

09:28.989 --> 09:32.125
I will.

09:32.176 --> 09:34.928
But before I do,

09:34.995 --> 09:37.047
I have some personal news
for you

09:37.131 --> 09:40.383
about how your firing
really went down.

09:43.270 --> 09:46.356
Ah, I love this.
We'd just won the championship.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.690
Might I get a copy?

09:47.775 --> 09:49.692
Yeah, I'll get one
framed for you.

09:49.777 --> 09:51.361
You can look at it
in the ten minutes

09:51.445 --> 09:52.862
before they
put you to death.

09:52.947 --> 09:54.680
The photograph
proves nothing.

09:54.732 --> 09:58.201
Trust me, there's a whole
lot more where that came from.

09:58.285 --> 10:01.571
We know all about the ties
between you and Stephen.

10:01.655 --> 10:02.906
Then bring them up.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.958
But I made a deal
to testify against Ava,

10:05.025 --> 10:06.459
and that is what
I'm going to do.

10:06.527 --> 10:07.961
No, you made a deal
to put away

10:08.028 --> 10:10.046
the person responsible
for ordering these killings,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.248
and I suggest you do that
while you still can.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.550
Young man...

10:13.634 --> 10:16.052
If your intention is to shake
my testimony,

10:16.137 --> 10:17.370
that is not
going to happen.

10:17.421 --> 10:18.888
It doesn't need
to happen,

10:18.973 --> 10:21.758
'cause once we prove
that you're lying about Ava,

10:21.842 --> 10:23.426
Cameron Dennis is going
to cancel your deal,

10:23.511 --> 10:25.812
and you're gonna come to me
begging for help.

10:28.816 --> 10:30.767
Do you think
you're the scariest man

10:30.851 --> 10:32.102
I've ever sat across from?

10:32.186 --> 10:34.737
I know
you're not scared of me.

10:34.822 --> 10:37.574
But you are scared
of your own people,

10:37.658 --> 10:39.325
and you should be,

10:39.393 --> 10:40.577
because you and I
both know

10:40.661 --> 10:43.396
they're gonna kill you
the minute you get back.

10:43.447 --> 10:46.065
That I know Stephen doesn't
mean I'm lying about Ava.

10:46.117 --> 10:47.200
But you are.

10:47.251 --> 10:49.335
Ah, and you can see
into my soul.

10:49.403 --> 10:51.337
It doesn't take a fortune
teller to know you're lying.

10:51.405 --> 10:53.906
And it doesn't take one
to know that if you had proof,

10:53.958 --> 10:55.842
you wouldn't be here
talking to me.

10:58.345 --> 11:00.580
So you're not protecting
Stephen out of principle.

11:00.631 --> 11:02.599
I'm not a man
of principle.

11:02.683 --> 11:05.351
I'm a man of expediency.
I get it.

11:05.419 --> 11:07.887
If you change your tune now,
you'll lose the deal you have.

11:07.938 --> 11:12.108
Therefore, I prefer to--
how do you say it--

11:12.193 --> 11:15.111
dance with the one
who brought me.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.618
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

11:21.702 --> 11:23.319
Game time's tomorrow.
We got nothing to say.

11:23.404 --> 11:24.770
I'm here to help you.

11:24.822 --> 11:26.456
I don't need your help.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.441
And you wouldn't be here
unless you need mine.

11:28.492 --> 11:29.909
You're wrong.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.045
I can help you do what you
always said you're all about--

11:32.112 --> 11:33.546
putting bad guys away.

11:33.614 --> 11:35.415
You got a confession for me?

11:35.466 --> 11:37.333
You're going
after the wrong person.

11:37.418 --> 11:39.302
You're her lawyer.
That's what you would say.

11:39.386 --> 11:41.337
I'm not here as her lawyer.

11:41.422 --> 11:42.805
This isn't a speech
for a jury.

11:42.890 --> 11:45.058
I'm here man-to-man to talk
to the guy I used to know.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.177
All right.

11:47.261 --> 11:48.728
Talk.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.848
- I know who really did this.
- Then tell me who it is.

11:51.932 --> 11:53.399
I need a guarantee
you won't use

11:53.467 --> 11:54.800
what I tell you
against David.

11:54.852 --> 11:56.569
If you think
I'm gonna guarantee you

11:56.637 --> 11:58.521
anything but a war tomorrow,

11:58.606 --> 12:00.139
you are sadly mistaken.

12:00.191 --> 12:02.192
I can't tell you who did it,
but somebody else can.

12:02.276 --> 12:03.476
Who?

12:03.527 --> 12:05.978
Colonel Mariga.

12:06.030 --> 12:07.997
Are you kidding me?

12:08.082 --> 12:09.649
I've got the murder weapon.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.151
He says Ava Hessington
pulled his trigger,

12:12.203 --> 12:13.986
and you want me to have him
change his story?

12:14.038 --> 12:15.154
He's only pointing at Ava

12:15.206 --> 12:16.489
because that's what
you want to hear.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.324
Change his deal,
he'll tell you the truth.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.760
He changes his story now,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.962
anything he says
about anybody means shit.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.547
It means shit in court,
but if you are

12:24.632 --> 12:27.884
who you say you are,
it should mean something to you.

12:27.968 --> 12:29.385
You know what, Harvey?

12:29.470 --> 12:32.105
I believe that you believe
she's innocent,

12:32.172 --> 12:33.533
and if you can convince me
of that,

12:33.607 --> 12:35.558
I won't go after her,
but I'm not gonna guarantee

12:35.643 --> 12:37.694
I won't use what you say
before I hear it.

12:37.778 --> 12:40.513
- You want me to just trust you?
- That's what you're asking me.

12:40.564 --> 12:43.399
But if you think that I'm gonna
kneecap my star witness

12:43.484 --> 12:46.653
the day before the trial,
you are out of your mind.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.780
Harold.

12:51.781 --> 12:53.064
What's up, man?
it's good to see you.

12:53.149 --> 12:54.549
I thought
you were my friend.

12:54.617 --> 12:56.117
I am.
What the hell?

12:56.185 --> 12:58.019
Friends don't say they tried
to save your job

12:58.070 --> 13:00.521
when, really,
they hung you out to dry.

13:00.573 --> 13:01.856
So it's true.

13:01.908 --> 13:03.375
Look, Harold,
I didn't mean to--

13:03.459 --> 13:05.210
You know what? Save whatever
bullshit explanation you have,

13:05.294 --> 13:06.545
because I don't want
to hear it.

13:06.629 --> 13:08.463
I'm not trying to give you
a bullshit explanation.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.631
Because there is none.

13:09.698 --> 13:11.216
You got to choose
between you and me,

13:11.300 --> 13:12.533
and you chose yourself.

13:13.033 --> 13:14.483
And then you lied to me
about it.

13:14.534 --> 13:15.534
Yes, Harold, I did.

13:15.619 --> 13:16.779
And then after I lied to you,

13:16.787 --> 13:19.672
I got you a job
at a huge, powerful firm.

13:19.756 --> 13:21.257
Yeah, you got me that job
so I'd owe you one

13:21.324 --> 13:22.258
when the time came.

13:22.325 --> 13:23.492
I got you that job

13:23.543 --> 13:25.160
because I thought you deserved
a second chance.

13:25.212 --> 13:27.680
And then you came calling
when you needed a lawsuit filed

13:27.764 --> 13:29.665
to get rid of your witnesses
in your murder trial.

13:29.716 --> 13:31.133
I trusted you
with that lawsuit

13:31.184 --> 13:32.551
because I thought
you were a competent attorney.

13:32.636 --> 13:34.887
And you were more than happy
to take it.

13:34.971 --> 13:37.556
And that murder trial you just
mentioned is about to start.

13:37.641 --> 13:39.892
So you can choose to be
pissed off with me or move on.

13:39.976 --> 13:42.611
But right now
I have a job to do.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.202
- Rachel.
- Louis, what did you do?

13:50.287 --> 13:51.704
What do you mean?
What is this?

13:51.788 --> 13:53.906
Fairfield Computers
is being sued.

13:53.990 --> 13:55.791
- How's that my fault?
- Because they're your client,

13:55.859 --> 13:57.460
and the attorney of record
is Harold Gunderson.

13:57.527 --> 14:00.129
He also sent
a settlement offer.

14:00.196 --> 14:02.882
He wants to pick
a fight with me.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.366
He's gonna regret
the day he was born.

14:04.418 --> 14:05.918
Aren't you the one
who picked a fight with him?

14:06.002 --> 14:07.887
Rachel, whose side
are you on?

14:07.971 --> 14:09.221
Don't answer that question.

14:12.759 --> 14:14.393
You shouldn't be here.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.897
Stephen said that we're
no different than he is.

14:17.981 --> 14:19.932
I need to see you show him
that he's wrong.

14:20.016 --> 14:22.151
This isn't his trial.
It's Ava's.

14:22.218 --> 14:23.719
You're not gonna put him
on the stand?

14:23.770 --> 14:25.571
You said you were gonna
make him pay.

14:25.655 --> 14:28.157
Donna, I will,
but now is not the time.

14:28.224 --> 14:30.392
Then when?
Because he killed people,

14:30.444 --> 14:33.162
and if we let him
get away with it...

14:33.229 --> 14:35.448
Then maybe we are
no different than he is.

14:37.033 --> 14:39.502
Had these insurgents
had their way,

14:39.569 --> 14:41.253
they would have blown up
the pipeline.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.173
Instead, Ms. Hessington
retained a valuable asset,

14:44.240 --> 14:47.259
and I, in turn, was compensated
for a job well done.

14:47.344 --> 14:51.130
And this compensation came
directly from Ava Hessington?

14:51.214 --> 14:52.598
Yes.

14:52.682 --> 14:54.884
She specifically directed you
to kill people?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.303
Yes.

14:57.387 --> 14:59.254
One more thing,
Colonel Mariga--

14:59.306 --> 15:01.440
do you and I have a deal
for you to testify

15:01.525 --> 15:04.110
in exchange
for a more lenient sentence?

15:04.194 --> 15:06.094
Yes.

15:06.146 --> 15:07.429
And why should
the jury believe

15:07.481 --> 15:09.765
that you aren't making this up
to save yourself?

15:09.816 --> 15:12.201
Because if what I say to you
proves to be a lie,

15:12.268 --> 15:14.436
you'll send me back home,

15:14.488 --> 15:17.123
where I will be dead
within minutes.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.457
No further questions.

15:22.829 --> 15:24.246
Ten minutes recess.

15:24.297 --> 15:26.298
Why didn't you just
jump right in there?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.300
I get it--
you read a book that says

15:28.385 --> 15:29.618
you don't let the jury
sit with things.

15:29.669 --> 15:30.719
The only problem is...

15:30.787 --> 15:31.887
We're not inside
of a book.

15:31.955 --> 15:33.422
And I don't want
to seem defensive.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.513
Harvey, we still have
a ton of shit to hit him with.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.793
Were you in there?
They're buying what he's saying.

15:37.844 --> 15:39.284
Then we make them
buy something else.

15:39.312 --> 15:40.896
We got a pair of aces.

15:40.964 --> 15:42.348
If the jury believes that
Cameron's got three of a kind,

15:42.432 --> 15:44.633
we're not gonna win.
We can't go after Stephen.

15:44.684 --> 15:46.018
Cameron
won't go after Ava

15:46.102 --> 15:47.653
if I can convince him
it was Stephen.

15:47.737 --> 15:49.071
- You went to Cameron?
- Yes.

15:49.138 --> 15:50.639
And you're going
to trust him?

15:50.690 --> 15:53.141
I'm not sure
we have another choice.

15:55.946 --> 15:57.530
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

15:57.614 --> 15:59.114
don't.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.033
I'm thinking I'd like
to rip your face off.

16:01.117 --> 16:02.718
You get Mariga
to point the finger at me,

16:02.786 --> 16:04.820
I will point it
straight at Ava.

16:04.871 --> 16:07.590
Stephen, Jessica
doesn't respond well to threats.

16:07.657 --> 16:09.091
Well, I don't make threats.

16:09.158 --> 16:11.210
I give warnings.

16:11.294 --> 16:13.295
You've been warned.

16:19.219 --> 16:21.554
Mr. Specter...

16:21.638 --> 16:24.273
I have no questions
for Colonel Mariga, Your Honor,

16:24.340 --> 16:26.341
but I'd like to call
a rebuttal witness.

16:26.393 --> 16:28.194
Harvey, come on,
you know what he's gonna say.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.895
I don't care
what he's gonna say.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.897
He's talking to the jury.
I'm talking to Cameron Dennis.

16:31.982 --> 16:36.068
The defense calls
Stephen Huntley to the stand.

16:36.152 --> 16:38.888
What has Stephen Huntley
got to do with this?

16:38.955 --> 16:40.539
Harvey knows
what he's doing.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.907
This is what
you wanted to sell me--

16:41.992 --> 16:43.209
a lawyer from your own
goddamn firm?

16:43.293 --> 16:44.573
You want to put away
the bad guy?

16:44.628 --> 16:47.046
I'm about to hand him to you
on a silver platter.

16:47.130 --> 16:50.382
Mr. Huntley,
did you work at the law firm

16:50.467 --> 16:52.635
headed by Edward Darby
last year?

16:52.702 --> 16:54.303
Yes.

16:54.370 --> 16:56.972
Did Mr. Darby ask you
to solve any problems

16:57.040 --> 16:58.474
for Hessington Oil

16:58.541 --> 17:00.676
regarding their pipeline
in the E.I.R.?

17:00.727 --> 17:02.811
I decline to answer under
my fifth amendment rights.

17:02.879 --> 17:05.064
The right
against self-incrimination.

17:05.147 --> 17:06.515
How long have you known
Colonel Mariga?

17:06.566 --> 17:07.733
I decline to answer.

17:07.817 --> 17:09.602
Is it true that you
went to school with him

17:09.685 --> 17:10.935
at the University
of Cape Town?

17:11.021 --> 17:12.054
I decline to answer.

17:12.105 --> 17:13.521
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

17:13.573 --> 17:15.491
You were teammates
on a championship rugby team.

17:15.558 --> 17:17.576
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.111
The witness is hostile,
Your Honor.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.030
Hostile? They work
at the same law firm.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.531
He was fired yesterday.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.199
Gentlemen, approach.

17:27.203 --> 17:29.421
He's making things up
to create reasonable doubt.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.924
I'm bringing things up,
so you'll see the truth.

17:32.008 --> 17:34.677
The only thing tying Ava to this
is Mariga's testimony.

17:34.744 --> 17:37.596
You only have Mariga because
you tapped Stephen's phone.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.914
That's a ridiculous
accusation.

17:38.965 --> 17:40.099
Cameron, please.

17:40.183 --> 17:42.935
Why did he call him?
How did he call him?

17:43.019 --> 17:44.436
Enough.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.555
You're on a short leash,
Mr. Specter.

17:46.606 --> 17:49.091
The gentleman
invoked his rights.

17:53.429 --> 17:55.948
Mr. Huntley, did you meet
with your old friend

17:56.032 --> 17:58.600
Emmanuel Mariga
and direct him

17:58.652 --> 18:01.704
to kill the opponent
of Hessington Oil's pipeline

18:01.771 --> 18:04.239
without Ava Hessington's
knowledge?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.209
I decline to answer.

18:07.276 --> 18:08.877
I have
no further questions.

18:08.945 --> 18:11.630
Mr. Dennis,
do you have any questions?

18:13.249 --> 18:15.951
Mr. Dennis.

18:21.091 --> 18:23.392
Mr. Huntley,
until you were let go,

18:23.459 --> 18:26.628
you worked at the same firm
as Mr. Specter, correct?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.296
Yes.

18:28.348 --> 18:31.150
And his job today
is to give this jury

18:31.234 --> 18:35.187
cause to doubt that
his client is the murderer?

18:35.271 --> 18:37.139
- Yes.
- In your experience...

18:37.190 --> 18:39.692
Is pointing the finger
at someone else

18:39.776 --> 18:41.309
a good strategy?

18:41.361 --> 18:43.579
It can be
an excellent strategy.

18:43.646 --> 18:46.081
And why do you think
that Mr. Specter

18:46.149 --> 18:47.866
is pointing the finger
at you?

18:47.951 --> 18:49.835
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

18:49.919 --> 18:52.988
that a few weeks ago
Ms. Hessington approached me

18:53.039 --> 18:54.373
and asked me
to bribe witnesses

18:54.457 --> 18:56.125
who were about
to testify against her,

18:56.176 --> 18:57.543
and I refused.

18:57.627 --> 18:59.211
And if you think
I'm lying under oath,

18:59.295 --> 19:02.214
then, please,
ask Mr. Specter.

19:02.298 --> 19:03.599
He knows that's the truth.

19:03.666 --> 19:06.552
And a woman who bribes
witnesses against her

19:06.636 --> 19:07.770
is not innocent.

19:07.837 --> 19:08.887
Objection.

19:08.972 --> 19:10.839
Withdrawn.
One last thing.

19:10.890 --> 19:13.942
Did the defendant
ask you to arrange a meeting

19:14.010 --> 19:16.311
with Colonel Mariga
where she she would pay him

19:16.363 --> 19:19.732
millions of dollars
in exchange for...

19:19.816 --> 19:21.734
Killing opponents
of her pipeline?

19:21.818 --> 19:24.036
I decline to answer.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.039
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

19:27.123 --> 19:28.741
No further questions.

19:38.047 --> 19:40.807
Is Stephen Huntley involved
in this,

19:40.861 --> 19:43.990
or is it some kind of stunt like
he just told the jury it was?

19:50.724 --> 19:52.491
He ordered the killings.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.610
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't have proof.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.945
Why would you put
that man on the stand?

19:58.013 --> 19:59.731
It was a calculated risk.

19:59.815 --> 20:02.450
You took a calculated risk
with my life

20:02.517 --> 20:05.686
without telling me.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.631
I'm sorry.

20:17.475 --> 20:19.509
You screwed me.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.011
I said
I wouldn't go after her

20:21.095 --> 20:22.979
if you convinced me--
you didn't convince me.

20:23.064 --> 20:24.181
Then take a recess

20:24.265 --> 20:25.982
instead of twisting
everything he said.

20:26.067 --> 20:27.868
I'm not gonna let the jury
sit with that shit.

20:27.902 --> 20:29.319
And thank God I didn't.

20:29.404 --> 20:30.970
Otherwise,
I would have found out

20:31.022 --> 20:32.656
that she tried
to bribe witnesses

20:32.740 --> 20:33.990
and you kept it from me.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.776
It had nothing to do
with the murders.

20:35.827 --> 20:37.327
That's funny--
when I kept things from you

20:37.412 --> 20:38.779
that had nothing to do
with other murders,

20:38.830 --> 20:39.830
you called me a criminal.

20:39.914 --> 20:40.997
Well, that ended up
with you

20:41.082 --> 20:42.916
putting an innocent person
in prison.

20:42.983 --> 20:45.035
And now you're doing it again.
Oh, don't give me that shit.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.337
Stephen Huntley is up
to his goddamn neck in this,

20:47.422 --> 20:48.872
and you know it.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.842
So he just goes around
killing his clients' enemies

20:51.926 --> 20:52.992
behind their backs?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.261
I don't think so.

20:54.328 --> 20:56.096
You want corroboration?
Ask Mariga.

20:56.163 --> 20:57.163
I just did.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.516
And he answered me
in open court.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.351
And I'm not putting
an innocent woman away.

21:01.436 --> 21:03.220
I'm doing my job.
Cameron-

21:03.304 --> 21:05.222
Lawyers killing people?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.024
That's a hell of a firm
you got your name on, Harvey.

21:08.109 --> 21:11.728
You must be proud to have left
the D.A.'s office for that.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.684
Let's do racquetball,
James.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.319
Again? Louis, you were
supposed to be waiting

21:19.370 --> 21:20.787
in the conference--
I don't wait for anyone.

21:20.855 --> 21:22.038
And you don't sue me.

21:22.123 --> 21:23.874
Yes, I do.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.493
Because I realized
I now work at a huge firm,

21:26.544 --> 21:28.361
and I have the power
to do this to you.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.774
Now, we can negotiate
a settlement,

21:29.831 --> 21:31.915
unless, of course, you don't
think you can handle me.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.750
Do you really want
to embarrass yourself

21:33.835 --> 21:35.201
with your mother watching?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.003
It kills you that they
don't ban us having pictures

21:37.054 --> 21:39.205
of our mothers,
like you did, doesn't it?

21:39.257 --> 21:41.341
A man is judged
by the photos he displays.

21:41.392 --> 21:42.926
You have a photo
of yourself.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.395
And now you're making
my point for me.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.398
You don't intimidate me
anymore, Louis.

21:48.483 --> 21:51.401
Really?
I know you, Harold.

21:51.486 --> 21:53.570
I know that you gargle
before meetings

21:53.654 --> 21:55.605
that make you nervous.

21:55.690 --> 21:59.559
And I...smell...mint.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.661
- I--
- We don't agree

22:01.729 --> 22:03.747
to paragraph three or four.
I need to have four.

22:03.831 --> 22:04.998
Or seven through ten.

22:05.065 --> 22:08.067
My mo--my client
won't stand for that.

22:08.119 --> 22:11.755
Your client will stand for
whatever the hell I give them!

22:11.839 --> 22:13.457
Please, can I have nine?

22:19.430 --> 22:20.380
You know what?

22:20.431 --> 22:21.798
I'll give you nine...

22:21.883 --> 22:23.403
Because it's meaningless,
and I want it

22:23.434 --> 22:25.418
to tell all the other paragraphs
out there what happens

22:25.470 --> 22:28.021
when Harold Gunderson
goes after Louis Litt.

22:28.088 --> 22:29.589
That doesn't make any sense.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.974
Haven't you ever seen
a mob movie?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.309
They always let one survive
to tell the others.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.110
Well, yeah,
but paragraphs can't talk--

22:34.195 --> 22:36.313
Okay, whatever. Fine.
Just type this up as agreed,

22:36.397 --> 22:38.865
and don't you ever let me see
your pasty, Norwegian,

22:38.933 --> 22:41.651
Carrot Top-wannabe
face again.

22:43.371 --> 22:45.655
Carrot Top is a very
underrated comedian

22:45.740 --> 22:47.273
who's never done anything
to anyone.

22:49.877 --> 22:51.795
Did you know that Harvey
was going to ambush Stephen

22:51.879 --> 22:52.996
on the stand?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.614
I wouldn't have stopped him
if I did.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.583
And to hell
with the ramifications?

22:56.634 --> 22:58.969
The ramifications for who,
Edward?

22:59.053 --> 23:01.137
I didn't come here to fight
with you, Jessica.

23:01.222 --> 23:03.289
But Stephen didn't take
the most direct hit.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.624
Ava did.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.810
You keep talking about
how much you care about Ava.

23:06.894 --> 23:08.311
But I've only just met her.

23:08.396 --> 23:11.982
And you're the one who did
what you did.

23:14.735 --> 23:18.021
I treated you
as if you were my own blood.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.105
Ava...

23:19.156 --> 23:20.907
Did you do this to me?

23:20.975 --> 23:22.442
Of course I didn't.

23:22.493 --> 23:26.246
Did you keep this
from me?

23:26.313 --> 23:29.666
I want to hear you say it.

23:29.750 --> 23:32.151
I didn't know
until it was too late.

23:34.655 --> 23:37.340
I didn't want to burden you
with what had been done

23:37.425 --> 23:39.009
to get your pipeline,

23:39.093 --> 23:41.378
and there was nothing
I could do to undo it.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.013
Burden me?

23:43.097 --> 23:44.497
What about protecting me?

23:44.549 --> 23:46.049
Well, that's exactly
what I was doing

23:46.133 --> 23:47.834
when I assigned Harvey
to the case.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.020
And after I was brought up
on murder charges,

23:50.104 --> 23:51.271
rather than tell me,

23:51.338 --> 23:53.506
you send the very man
who committed the crime.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.192
Who were you trying
not to burden then?

24:08.188 --> 24:11.374
You once asked me if she knew
about her father and I.

24:11.459 --> 24:16.029
In those days,
to be a lawyer and to be out--

24:16.080 --> 24:18.248
not possible.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.083
Her father
was in the oil business.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.368
He would have been finished.
What does that have to do-

24:22.420 --> 24:25.538
We used to go away
on occasion.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.424
In order to do that,

24:27.508 --> 24:31.394
Ava joined us and pretended
to be my girlfriend.

24:31.479 --> 24:32.929
She did that for us.

24:37.151 --> 24:40.070
Ava is family to me.

24:40.154 --> 24:42.022
I sent Stephen out there
to help her.

24:42.073 --> 24:43.990
I didn't know what he'd do.

24:44.058 --> 24:46.409
And I would give anything
to undo it.

24:49.614 --> 24:52.248
What do you want
from me, Edward?

24:52.333 --> 24:54.000
I want you to put aside
your anger

24:54.068 --> 24:55.835
and figure out a way to help.

25:02.576 --> 25:04.210
What are you doing here?

25:04.261 --> 25:06.763
I'm here to put aside
my anger.

25:06.847 --> 25:09.099
We're in the middle
of a murder trial.

25:09.183 --> 25:11.518
We can spare
five minutes for this.

25:11.585 --> 25:13.103
Wait a second.

25:13.187 --> 25:16.106
I gave you that bottle
when you took over from Daniel.

25:16.190 --> 25:18.925
- I know.
- I told you to only open it

25:18.976 --> 25:20.110
in case of an emergency.

25:20.194 --> 25:23.096
You think this isn't
an emergency?

25:23.147 --> 25:25.031
We're about
to lose a huge murder case,

25:25.099 --> 25:27.117
and it turns out
the person behind it

25:27.201 --> 25:29.119
is one of our own lawyers.

25:29.203 --> 25:31.121
And we're in business

25:31.205 --> 25:33.156
with the man
who helped cover it up.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.108
But the thing
that's been most on my mind

25:35.159 --> 25:39.045
is that you goddamn
betrayed me.

25:41.215 --> 25:43.583
Now...

25:43.634 --> 25:47.303
The truth is, you warned me
about all of this.

25:47.388 --> 25:51.057
And I am tired
of feeling betrayed by you.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.476
I'd rather forgive you.

25:55.479 --> 25:56.730
Can you?

25:56.797 --> 25:58.848
Why do you think I'm here.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.651
I never should have come
after you.

26:01.736 --> 26:03.987
I'm sorry.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.524
You didn't kill anybody.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.410
And if I'm really
going to forgive you,

26:10.477 --> 26:12.362
then I need
to tell you I'm sorry

26:12.446 --> 26:14.998
that I made you want to do it
in the first place.

26:22.256 --> 26:24.174
What changed your mind?

26:24.258 --> 26:27.326
Edward.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.513
He said Ava
was family to him.

26:32.016 --> 26:34.017
You're family to me,

26:34.101 --> 26:36.269
and you did what he didn't.

26:36.336 --> 26:38.138
You came clean.

26:38.189 --> 26:41.224
Is that all you came here
to tell me?

26:41.308 --> 26:43.777
Like you said, we're in
the middle of a murder trial.

26:43.844 --> 26:46.196
And you have an idea.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.814
We're not the only people

26:47.865 --> 26:49.899
that are like family
to each other.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.818
And sometimes
you have to put your family

26:51.869 --> 26:53.903
in a position
where they don't have a choice.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.189
What do you need me to do?

27:04.251 --> 27:06.151
New plan-we're gonna
convince Cameron

27:06.176 --> 27:07.292
that Ava's innocent.

27:07.341 --> 27:09.042
Have you been drinking?

27:09.093 --> 27:10.510
Yeah. Why?

27:10.578 --> 27:12.012
Because wasn't that
the old plan?

27:12.079 --> 27:13.263
That was the old goal.

27:13.347 --> 27:15.081
This time, it's you
who's going to Cameron.

27:15.132 --> 27:16.633
If he won't hear
the truth from you,

27:16.717 --> 27:18.802
how's he gonna hear it
from me?

27:20.254 --> 27:21.972
Cameron can't see the truth
because all he sees

27:22.056 --> 27:23.473
is that he has
a winnable case.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.275
How does that affect
what I just said?

27:25.359 --> 27:26.776
Prosecutors are hammers,

27:26.861 --> 27:28.182
and they see the accused
as nails.

27:28.196 --> 27:30.363
How am I gonna change that?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.615
You're gonna gonna remind him

27:31.699 --> 27:34.150
about the time
he hit the wrong nail.

27:36.037 --> 27:38.121
Can you tell me
how the waffles are here?

27:38.206 --> 27:41.741
Mike Ross, my man.

27:41.792 --> 27:42.942
It's good to see you, man.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.794
It's good to see you too,
Clifford.

27:44.879 --> 27:46.630
What the hell you doing out
in the middle of the night?

27:46.714 --> 27:47.831
Oh, you know, I told you.

27:47.915 --> 27:50.133
I got an urge
for some waffles.

27:50.218 --> 27:51.951
This isn't a coincidence,
is it?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.054
I need a favor.

27:54.121 --> 27:55.555
No doubt.
What you need?

27:55.623 --> 27:58.141
I need you to talk
to Cameron Dennis.

27:58.226 --> 28:00.310
No.

28:00.394 --> 28:01.561
Hell, no.

28:01.629 --> 28:03.430
- Clifford...
- Look at me, man.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.148
Look where I am...

28:05.233 --> 28:07.350
Cleaning up people's shit!
I know.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.486
You know this is all I can get
because of him?

28:09.570 --> 28:13.406
My life passed me by
because of that motherf--

28:13.474 --> 28:15.909
I get in a room with him,
I'll kill him.

28:15.976 --> 28:17.456
And I need you to tell him
all of that

28:17.495 --> 28:19.746
so that he doesn't do
the same thing to somebody else.

28:19.813 --> 28:22.165
You need?

28:22.250 --> 28:24.501
I know who "you" is.

28:24.585 --> 28:26.536
And I don't owe Harvey shit.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.154
Now, he may have
got me out,

28:28.205 --> 28:30.490
but he and Cameron put me there
in the first place.

28:30.541 --> 28:33.260
Yeah, you're right.
You don't owe Harvey.

28:33.327 --> 28:35.512
But you do owe me...

28:35.596 --> 28:37.847
'Cause I didn't have anything
to do with putting you in there,

28:37.932 --> 28:40.550
but I broke the law
to get you out.

28:47.675 --> 28:49.008
I am feeling generous,

28:49.060 --> 28:52.011
so absolutely, 100%,
without a doubt,

28:52.063 --> 28:53.780
go screw yourself.

28:53.847 --> 28:55.198
Everything okay?

28:55.283 --> 28:56.516
Yeah, of course.

28:56.567 --> 28:57.951
I was just using
tactic number 36

28:58.018 --> 28:59.686
in Louis Litt's handbook,
due to be published never

28:59.737 --> 29:01.321
because I don't share
my tactics.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.707
Tactic number seven,
by the way.

29:03.791 --> 29:05.191
Okay.

29:05.242 --> 29:07.694
Well, whatever tactic you used
on Harold didn't work.

29:07.745 --> 29:09.129
He's not caving.

29:09.196 --> 29:10.630
I don't know
what you're talking about,

29:10.698 --> 29:12.082
because he gave me
everything I wanted.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.500
The client just called.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.868
The contract Harold sent over
has a loophole in it.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.505
It leaves him open
to punitive damages.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.040
Paragraph nine.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.642
Get that contract back.

29:22.710 --> 29:25.011
We need to renegotiate.

29:25.062 --> 29:28.064
Oh, my God, Harold
pulled one over on you.

29:28.149 --> 29:29.429
Don't you dare
say that out loud.

29:29.483 --> 29:30.717
Call him up,
set up the appointment

29:30.768 --> 29:32.435
for me to go over there.
I tried.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.771
He insisted on coming here.
He's on his way right now.

29:34.855 --> 29:36.072
He.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.911
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:41.996 --> 29:43.896
He's here
to tell you who you are.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.115
I know who I am.

29:45.199 --> 29:47.250
I don't need
to hear it from him.

29:47.335 --> 29:50.086
You think I'm giving you
a choice?

30:02.883 --> 30:06.219
Okay. We were supposed to meet
in the conference room.

30:06.270 --> 30:07.950
I don't need to wait
in the conference room

30:07.972 --> 30:09.589
to knock your dick
in the dirt.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.940
What'd you just say to me?

30:11.025 --> 30:12.592
It's from <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
asshole.

30:12.643 --> 30:14.444
Not all of us only watch
<i>The Sound Of Music.</i>

30:14.528 --> 30:16.980
You little bastard.
You just crossed a line.

30:17.064 --> 30:19.265
Julie Andrews
is a national treasure.

30:19.316 --> 30:21.651
Maybe your client
would be better off with her.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.736
Maybe they would be.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.937
But she isn't here.
And I am.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.106
And here are a few
of my favorite things--

30:27.158 --> 30:28.992
countersuit for slander,

30:29.076 --> 30:30.994
motion to decertify class,

30:31.078 --> 30:32.796
motion for summary judgment,

30:32.880 --> 30:35.081
change of venue, sanctions,

30:35.132 --> 30:38.301
depositions, discovery!

30:38.386 --> 30:40.720
Great use
of folders there, Louis.

30:40.788 --> 30:42.505
Too bad none of them
are gonna work.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.123
Well, they may not work
on the case,

30:44.175 --> 30:46.309
but they're definitely
gonna work on you.

30:46.394 --> 30:47.894
What are you talking about?

30:47.961 --> 30:49.962
Oh, I'm talking
about you may win in the end,

30:50.014 --> 30:52.849
but it won't justify you
spending every waking minute

30:52.933 --> 30:54.350
of your life
on this bullshit,

30:54.435 --> 30:57.353
instead of doing everything else
you've been assigned to do.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.739
- You'd do that to me?
- I won't be doing it to you.

30:59.807 --> 31:01.741
I'll be doing it
for Bratton Gould.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.243
And you'll be laughed
out of there

31:03.310 --> 31:04.950
the same way you were laughed
out of here.

31:04.978 --> 31:06.579
- Louis--
- We got nothing left to say!

31:06.647 --> 31:08.331
Drop the suit
by the end of the week,

31:08.416 --> 31:10.700
or one of my associates
will see you in court.

31:10.785 --> 31:11.835
Get out!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.350
I don't want him here.

31:27.435 --> 31:30.687
Ava, whatever he did,
he's here to help,

31:30.771 --> 31:32.872
and he's an asset.

31:32.940 --> 31:36.008
Then what does the mighty
Edward Darby have to say?

31:36.060 --> 31:38.061
You're innocent
until proven guilty

31:38.145 --> 31:39.646
beyond a reasonable doubt.

31:39.697 --> 31:40.864
Take the stand.

31:40.948 --> 31:43.316
Any juror that hears you
will have that doubt.

31:43.367 --> 31:44.901
She opens that door,
the first question

31:44.985 --> 31:47.987
Cameron asks is, did she try
and bribe those witnesses?

31:48.038 --> 31:52.909
The answer is yes.
There goes reasonable doubt.

31:52.993 --> 31:54.294
How much did you pay him?

31:54.361 --> 31:56.045
- Cameron.
- Pay who?

31:56.130 --> 31:58.715
Don't play dumb.
Clifford Danner.

31:58.799 --> 32:00.583
Who the hell
is Clifford Danner?

32:00.668 --> 32:03.052
He was an innocent person
that Cameron put behind bars.

32:03.137 --> 32:04.817
And I thought
he would make you see reason.

32:04.872 --> 32:06.055
That has nothing
to do with this.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.707
And I didn't put him
behind bars--you did.

32:07.758 --> 32:09.142
Then I got him out.

32:09.209 --> 32:11.060
Well, you're not getting
her out, because she did it,

32:11.145 --> 32:13.813
and yesterday your own colleague
said that she did it.

32:13.881 --> 32:16.266
He did not say that,
and you know it.

32:16.350 --> 32:18.351
- You willing to take that risk?
- What are you suggesting?

32:18.402 --> 32:19.853
I've worked with him
long enough

32:19.904 --> 32:21.237
to know what he's suggesting.

32:21.322 --> 32:23.156
Cameron Dennis
doesn't go to verdict.

32:23.223 --> 32:24.858
He cuts deals.
Then let me tell you...

32:24.909 --> 32:27.410
About what's
behind door number one--

32:27.495 --> 32:29.061
Eight years.

32:30.447 --> 32:33.500
Eight years instead of forever.
Leave us alone.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.169
Court's in ten minutes.
You have until then.

32:37.621 --> 32:39.172
Harvey...

32:39.239 --> 32:40.957
He's got us,
and you know it.

32:41.041 --> 32:42.208
No, he doesn't.

32:42.259 --> 32:44.127
She's not going to prison
for one day.

32:44.211 --> 32:46.012
She's going
for the rest of her life

32:46.079 --> 32:47.747
if we don't take this deal.

32:47.798 --> 32:49.432
I am not losing to him.

32:49.517 --> 32:52.251
You-your blood feud

32:52.303 --> 32:54.304
or whatever it is
you have with that man

32:54.388 --> 32:57.307
is what put the target
on my back in the first place.

32:57.391 --> 32:59.943
Ava, we need
to face reality.

33:00.027 --> 33:02.362
She is not taking that deal.

33:02.429 --> 33:05.448
She better, because
she can't buy her way out of it.

33:05.533 --> 33:07.934
And you can't cover up
your way out of it.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.435
- I don't care.
- Well, what's your idea?

33:09.486 --> 33:10.870
Because unless
you're gonna testify

33:10.938 --> 33:13.039
that Stephen did this
without Ava's knowledge,

33:13.106 --> 33:14.240
you can't help.

33:14.291 --> 33:15.992
And as you said,
you have no proof.

33:16.076 --> 33:19.579
So why don't you get out of the
room and let the grown-ups talk?

33:19.630 --> 33:22.498
What if I was
to testify to that?

33:24.418 --> 33:26.002
What are you talking about?

33:26.086 --> 33:28.671
I'm talking about putting
words to a conversation

33:28.756 --> 33:30.974
that should have happened
but didn't.

33:31.058 --> 33:34.477
You'd say that you confronted
Stephen, and he admitted it?

33:34.562 --> 33:37.463
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

33:37.514 --> 33:38.965
This isn't gonna help.

33:39.016 --> 33:41.634
You're her old friend coming
to her aid at the last second.

33:41.685 --> 33:42.769
It's a lie.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.187
The jury will see
right through it.

33:44.271 --> 33:45.855
Then we need to make Cameron
believe it.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.857
Harvey, Cameron wants a win.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.859
You need to convince him
this is a win.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.579
Can you do that?

33:52.646 --> 33:55.999
I guess it's the best shot
we have.

34:06.193 --> 34:09.009
I knew you would cave.
With five minutes to spare.

34:09.717 --> 34:11.550
We're not here
to take your offer, Cameron.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.851
We want you to take ours.

34:12.936 --> 34:15.170
Nah, I'm not negotiating.
Eight years is final.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.839
This isn't about making
a deal for Ava.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.274
It's about making
a deal for me.

34:18.341 --> 34:21.176
If he's got something
to say about this,

34:21.228 --> 34:23.279
you should put him
on the stand.

34:23.346 --> 34:27.065
I already trusted you once.
I need your word.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.018
Go ahead.
Off the record.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.487
I instructed Stephen Huntley
to do whatever it took

34:32.539 --> 34:33.906
to get Ava her pipeline,

34:33.991 --> 34:36.742
and I told him
to do it behind her back.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.694
So you authorized
these murders.

34:38.745 --> 34:39.862
Absolutely not.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.530
When I heard people
had been killed,

34:41.581 --> 34:42.748
I confronted him immediately.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.382
And what did he say?

34:44.467 --> 34:46.385
He didn't care
that he'd resorted to murder.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.203
His job
was to get things done.

34:48.255 --> 34:52.257
You just admitted to being
an accessory after the fact.

34:52.342 --> 34:53.926
No, he didn't.

34:54.011 --> 34:58.014
I get it.
Off the record.

34:58.065 --> 34:59.214
What do you want?

34:59.266 --> 35:01.600
Edward pleads
to obstruction of justice--

35:01.685 --> 35:02.985
five years probation.

35:03.053 --> 35:05.104
You drop the charges
against Ava.

35:05.188 --> 35:06.238
And he testifies

35:06.323 --> 35:08.991
at Stephen Huntley's
murder trial.

35:11.227 --> 35:14.229
And why would I swap out Ava
for her minion?

35:14.281 --> 35:18.084
Cameron, you gave us
that offer for a reason.

35:18.168 --> 35:20.569
You're at the finish line--
you can taste the win,

35:20.620 --> 35:23.339
but it's not 100%,
and you know it,

35:23.406 --> 35:25.446
because you're still banking
on an admitted murderer

35:25.459 --> 35:26.959
with an incentive to lie.

35:27.044 --> 35:28.794
I'm giving you
a respected lawyer

35:28.879 --> 35:31.914
with an incentive to keep
his mouth shut.

35:31.965 --> 35:34.416
You know who has
a better chance

35:34.468 --> 35:37.970
at getting you a win.

35:42.526 --> 35:44.143
Draw up the paperwork.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.467
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

36:08.552 --> 36:10.285
I thought
about what you said.

36:10.337 --> 36:13.122
What, about the kind
of business your firm does?

36:13.173 --> 36:15.841
Yes.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.893
And I realized that maybe
you're not as bad

36:17.961 --> 36:19.979
as I said you were.

36:20.063 --> 36:22.798
- No?
- No.

36:24.968 --> 36:27.486
You're much worse.

36:31.575 --> 36:34.476
Harvey and Cameron
made a deal to take you down,

36:34.528 --> 36:36.996
and part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

36:37.080 --> 36:39.165
to tell you about it.

36:43.486 --> 36:46.655
I meant it when I said
I never meant to hurt you.

36:46.706 --> 36:49.959
And I meant it when I said
that you make me sick.

36:59.102 --> 37:00.386
It's all there.

37:00.470 --> 37:03.222
You testify, you get
five years probation.

37:03.306 --> 37:05.691
And he pleads
obstruction of justice.

37:05.776 --> 37:07.526
- What is this?
- What is what?

37:07.611 --> 37:09.528
This says that I forfeit
my license

37:09.613 --> 37:11.530
to practice law
in this country.

37:11.615 --> 37:13.682
Oh, that--that's just
something I added in.

37:13.733 --> 37:15.818
- This is unacceptable.
- Wait a minute.

37:15.869 --> 37:18.020
How could you add that in
if we did the paperwork?

37:18.071 --> 37:20.206
And if he can't practice law
in the country,

37:20.290 --> 37:21.570
he can't be a member
of our firm.

37:21.575 --> 37:25.077
We must have agreed to it
in advance.

37:25.162 --> 37:27.580
You set
this whole thing up.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.548
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.217
But what's it matter?

37:31.301 --> 37:32.885
You really gonna put this
on Ava

37:32.969 --> 37:34.637
when you can get off
with a slap on the wrist?

37:34.704 --> 37:36.672
I asked you to put aside
your anger.

37:36.723 --> 37:39.842
I did.
You said Ava was family.

37:39.893 --> 37:42.728
The thing about family
is they make it easy

37:42.813 --> 37:46.015
to put you in the position
where you don't have a choice.

37:46.066 --> 37:48.017
Now, you gonna
sign the deal,

37:48.068 --> 37:51.220
or do I just pick up the trial
right where we left off?

37:55.859 --> 37:57.576
You're doing
the right thing, Edward.

37:57.661 --> 38:00.246
We'll worry about the terms
of our dissolution tomorrow.

38:02.249 --> 38:03.899
And, Edward...

38:03.950 --> 38:05.751
We may be getting a divorce,

38:05.836 --> 38:08.454
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

38:14.845 --> 38:16.912
Who'd have thought
we'd end up here?

38:16.963 --> 38:18.247
I did.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.965
No, you didn't.

38:20.050 --> 38:21.800
You took a chance
with Clifford Danner,

38:21.885 --> 38:23.302
and you know it.

38:23.386 --> 38:24.970
It wasn't a chance.

38:25.055 --> 38:26.421
I played the man.

38:26.473 --> 38:29.775
And, Cameron, you're not
only about winning.

38:29.860 --> 38:32.278
You're about putting
guilty people away.

38:35.198 --> 38:37.149
Nice working with you.

38:37.234 --> 38:40.619
Onetime deal.

38:40.704 --> 38:42.144
I guess this means
you're not looking

38:42.205 --> 38:43.372
for another name partner?

38:43.439 --> 38:45.241
Goodbye, Cameron.

38:52.549 --> 38:54.300
Norma said you
had something for me?

38:54.384 --> 38:56.335
I do.

38:58.722 --> 39:00.639
He dropped it.
I win.

39:00.724 --> 39:03.509
Do you?

39:05.628 --> 39:07.813
What?
What are you talking about?

39:07.898 --> 39:10.966
Why do you hate Harold
so much?

39:11.017 --> 39:12.801
- I don't hate him.
- Yeah, you do...

39:12.852 --> 39:14.353
Because I've never seen you
be as mean to anyone

39:14.437 --> 39:15.654
as you are to him.
Rachel, I-

39:15.739 --> 39:17.907
- don't "Rachel" me.
He's a human being.

39:17.974 --> 39:19.658
What's the matter with you?

39:25.949 --> 39:28.867
When I was a kid
in gym class...

39:31.454 --> 39:33.205
We had to climb the rope.

39:34.624 --> 39:37.159
Every day I tried
really hard,

39:37.210 --> 39:39.378
and every day...

39:39.462 --> 39:41.764
Everyone would laugh at me.

39:46.803 --> 39:50.005
The one thing in my life
that I've always been great at

39:50.056 --> 39:52.691
is training
the associates...

39:52.776 --> 39:55.644
Except for Harold.

39:55.695 --> 39:57.179
He's my failure.

39:57.230 --> 40:00.566
And every time
I look at him, it...

40:03.787 --> 40:05.821
puts me right back
in gym class.

40:11.411 --> 40:13.629
Louis...

40:13.696 --> 40:15.965
Harold's climbing
that rope.

40:16.032 --> 40:17.699
He's succeeding.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.635
And the way
you got this victory

40:19.702 --> 40:22.087
was by going
after his career.

40:22.172 --> 40:25.758
And you're just yanking him
right back down.

40:38.188 --> 40:40.656
We never got this.

40:40.723 --> 40:43.392
Send back his original offer
marked "accepted."

40:52.168 --> 40:55.237
I never want this
spoken of again.

40:55.288 --> 40:57.406
You never want what
spoken of again?

41:00.377 --> 41:02.878
Harvey,
what did Ava have to say?

41:02.929 --> 41:05.214
She'd already left
for the airport.

41:05.265 --> 41:08.300
Someone saves my life,
I might stop to say thank you.

41:08.385 --> 41:09.718
You really blame her

41:09.769 --> 41:11.303
after what this firm
put her through?

41:11.388 --> 41:12.688
When you put it
that way...

41:12.755 --> 41:14.640
It doesn't matter.
It was a huge win.

41:14.724 --> 41:16.258
Go celebrate.

41:16.309 --> 41:17.443
Whoa.
Hey, hey.

41:17.527 --> 41:18.927
Don't you mean
"let's go celebrate"?

41:18.928 --> 41:21.096
Am I really the person
you want to celebrate

41:21.147 --> 41:22.981
this big murder-trial
victory with?

41:23.066 --> 41:24.933
I don't know. It depends.
Do you put out?

41:24.984 --> 41:27.436
- Why don't you ask Rachel?
- That's not funny.

41:42.552 --> 41:45.637
Harvey.

41:45.722 --> 41:48.424
Donna.

41:48.475 --> 41:49.624
How'd it go?

41:49.676 --> 41:52.177
As well as it could.

41:55.849 --> 41:57.799
Harvey...

42:00.353 --> 42:02.137
Thank you.

42:02.188 --> 42:04.656
Why don't you keep the car?

42:04.741 --> 42:07.142
I feel like walking tonight.
