03:27.900 --> 03:29.810
I hate that part.

03:34.108 --> 03:37.458
Bounty hunters, have you
completed your mission?

03:37.501 --> 03:39.802
Oh, yeah, we wasted him.

03:39.069 --> 03:41.044
Check out the head
on this sucker.

03:41.086 --> 03:44.315
Fine, however, an earlier
expedition remains incomplete.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.453
A G-sweep of the planet Earth
indicates residual Crite life.

03:48.814 --> 03:51.293
- G-sweep's wrong.
- No way, Your Holiness...

03:51.326 --> 03:53.564
I was there.
I saw it all.

03:53.598 --> 03:55.226
The G-sweep is
infallible.

03:55.263 --> 03:58.144
The council is very nervous
when it comes to the Crites.

03:58.344 --> 04:01.181
They are a lethal plague
and must be wiped out.

04:01.217 --> 04:03.453
Pay for the Hexapod kill
shall be withheld

04:03.489 --> 04:06.556
until the eradication
of Crites on Earth is verified.

04:06.593 --> 04:08.732
There must be no doubt.

04:15.267 --> 04:17.339
Does this mean
we're going back to Earth?

04:45.100 --> 04:47.585
What takes you
to Grover's Bend, son?

04:47.622 --> 04:49.313
My grandmother
lives there.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.455
Oh, Easter vacation
with Granny, huh?

04:51.495 --> 04:53.404
That's
a good grandson.

04:56.182 --> 04:58.692
You know what the Bend's
famous for, don't you?

05:00.296 --> 05:02.204
What's that?

05:02.248 --> 05:05.347
Hasn't your granny ever told you
about those space porcupine things?

05:05.386 --> 05:08.702
No. No, she never did.

05:08.744 --> 05:11.079
Bunch of folks hereabout
think they came

05:11.113 --> 05:14.179
from one of those unidentified
flying UFOs or some such.

05:14.217 --> 05:16.672
Some say those
little boogers attacked

05:16.715 --> 05:19.895
one of the farms
outside of town.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.155
Maybe a friend
of your granny's, huh?

05:21.194 --> 05:22.601
The Browns.

05:22.634 --> 05:27.272
No... no, no.
She doesn't know any Browns.

05:47.534 --> 05:49.356
Come on, man!

05:49.390 --> 05:51.365
Buried treasure
right this way.

05:55.503 --> 05:57.413
What the hell
are we doing?

05:57.455 --> 05:59.527
Ain't nobody lived here
in two years.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.585
What exactly
are we looking for?

06:04.624 --> 06:07.624
Collector's items.
Nothing like them.

06:07.664 --> 06:10.795
Just like all the other weird shit
you got in your store.

06:10.834 --> 06:14.412
Jeez, it's freezing
in here.

06:23.923 --> 06:25.663
What are they?

06:25.074 --> 06:27.213
Whatever you tell people
they are.

06:28.371 --> 06:30.378
So what do you say?

06:32.115 --> 06:34.505
These things
ain't worth dick!

06:36.212 --> 06:37.935
Okay, fine.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.793
I'll just take 'em
up to K.C.

06:39.828 --> 06:42.764
See what one of them big antique
stores'll give me for them.

06:42.805 --> 06:45.226
- You do that.
- But...

06:46.517 --> 06:48.885
a case of Meister Brau would
save me a lot of trouble.

06:51.573 --> 06:54.127
- Load 'em up.
- Right!

07:41.565 --> 07:43.473
Perfect fit!

07:44.541 --> 07:46.777
Come on, kids,
let's go. Hurry up.

07:46.813 --> 07:48.700
Hey, Sis, dinner's
at 6:00, okay?

07:48.733 --> 07:50.326
'Kay, Megan!

07:52.414 --> 07:54.967
- You put...
- No, no, no.

07:55.285 --> 07:58.902
Okay, okay. We'll pull the photo
one column to the left.

07:58.943 --> 08:01.431
Now we'll keep
the 4H Club sidebar,

08:01.470 --> 08:05.181
and we will swap
the sidewalk weeds issue

08:05.215 --> 08:07.899
with the Easter egg hunt
right here!

08:07.935 --> 08:10.303
- l-l...
- Yeah.

08:10.336 --> 08:13.086
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi, honey!

08:13.121 --> 08:16.219
- I got the returns.
- Just put them back by the...

08:16.258 --> 08:18.298
- the typeset, will you?
- Okay.

08:18.338 --> 08:21.206
What do we do about
the 39-pound squash?

08:21.249 --> 08:23.616
We bury it somewhere
on page four.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.966
- Didn't you say it was 29 pounds?
- 39.

08:28.209 --> 08:30.588
I weighed
ol' jumbo myself.

08:31.715 --> 08:33.952
Better move it
up to page one.

08:40.932 --> 08:43.419
We're still looking
at empty space here.

08:43.461 --> 08:45.370
Put that back!

08:50.406 --> 08:52.381
I got a stop-press
story for you.

08:52.422 --> 08:54.113
What's that?

08:54.149 --> 08:56.290
"Bus driver
finds Grover's Bend"?

08:56.326 --> 08:59.839
"Brad Brown is
back in town."

08:59.878 --> 09:01.568
Bradley Brown?!

09:01.606 --> 09:03.494
The boy who cried
'critter.'

09:03.527 --> 09:06.145
We don't want to get scooped
on this one, Mr. Morgan.

09:06.183 --> 09:09.152
Not much chance of that, Sal.
We're the only paper in 80 miles.

09:09.192 --> 09:11.712
This is big news
in Grover's Bend.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.345
Inquiring minds
want to know!

09:14.695 --> 09:15.683
- Like mine.
- Mm-hmm.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.551
Just forget it, Sal. That boy's
stories nearly tore this town apart.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.829
Just let Grover's Bend
forget about that night.

09:21.866 --> 09:24.832
I mean it, Sal, no...
Brad Brown.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.358
Brad who?

09:47.565 --> 09:50.827
Snacktime!
Here we are!

09:50.861 --> 09:54.855
Don't you have
any Clark Bars or Milk Duds?

09:54.894 --> 09:58.123
Honey, fresh vegetables
are high in fiber,

09:58.158 --> 10:01.225
and we need fiber
for a healthy B.M.

10:01.263 --> 10:04.531
We don't want to get
constipated, do we?

10:04.861 --> 10:06.949
- No!
- No, we don't.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.233
I know who that is!

10:16.273 --> 10:19.934
Bradley, come on in.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.488
- Hi, Nana.
- Look at you...

10:21.521 --> 10:23.529
you're shooting up
like a stinkweed.

10:26.578 --> 10:28.488
You've been
eating red meat.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.635
No! No, no, no.
Not me.

10:30.674 --> 10:33.838
It's the worst thing
you could do to that body.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.875
Come in here and have
a good snack with these kids.

10:36.915 --> 10:39.567
You know the carnivores
have short intestines

10:39.604 --> 10:41.610
and the meat passes
right out through?

10:41.652 --> 10:43.439
But we're herbivores,

10:43.476 --> 10:45.548
we've got great
long intestines

10:45.588 --> 10:47.498
and the meat
just rots in there.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.785
No, no, you stop it.

11:13.272 --> 11:16.533
Quigley, get your stupid dog
out of the way.

11:18.328 --> 11:20.237
Chili Dog,
get in the back.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.484
Go on, get back.
Go on.

11:22.521 --> 11:23.765
Get in the back.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.688
Get in the back
you miserable son of a bitch!

11:25.721 --> 11:27.379
Go on!

11:27.417 --> 11:30.517
- It's just a dog.
- So was "Cujo."

11:39.707 --> 11:41.910
Shit.

12:03.135 --> 12:05.339
Hi, Harv.

12:12.558 --> 12:14.234
What in the hell
are you doing here?

12:15.359 --> 12:18.840
Important business.
Brad Brown is back in town.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.947
Oh... well,
on the important chart

12:21.984 --> 12:24.440
I'd put that right
between a pineapple quiche

12:24.480 --> 12:26.007
and a pimple
on the ass.

12:26.390 --> 12:29.758
I thought you'd want to talk with
him... about the critters and all.

12:29.794 --> 12:32.511
Why in the hell would I want
to do a thing like that?

12:32.545 --> 12:34.962
If I never talk
to anybody

12:34.146 --> 12:36.480
about them things
that shall remain nameless,

12:36.515 --> 12:38.620
I'll die a happy man...
and besides that,

12:38.658 --> 12:42.336
I ain't been sheriff of this burg
for two glorious years.

12:42.371 --> 12:45.601
Why don't you
run along home, Sal,

12:45.635 --> 12:48.800
because they're about
to start the bonus round.

12:55.269 --> 12:57.211
Here's the last of them.

12:57.253 --> 12:59.620
Put them with the rest
of them, brain dead.

13:09.991 --> 13:12.893
So... what about
them brewskies?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.873
This is all that
plain-wrap piss.

13:19.912 --> 13:21.853
I thought we agreed
on Meister Brau.

13:21.896 --> 13:23.805
I ain't got
no Meister Brau.

13:23.849 --> 13:26.182
Then I'm taking two.

13:29.478 --> 13:30.952
And a couple of these!

13:38.538 --> 13:40.775
I hate teenagers.

13:43.243 --> 13:44.934
Quigley!

13:48.588 --> 13:52.161
Now... what in the hell
am I gonna do with you?

13:54.509 --> 13:58.672
...Right onto highway 54,
just outside of Grover's Bend.

13:58.123 --> 14:00.426
We'd love to see ya.

14:00.462 --> 14:04.853
- Moo-ve.
- # At the Hungry Heifer #

14:04.141 --> 14:06.925
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

14:11.439 --> 14:13.130
Say...

14:13.167 --> 14:15.371
how come...

14:15.406 --> 14:17.741
you look like
that rock and roll guy,

14:17.775 --> 14:20.164
and Lee's still a...

14:20.207 --> 14:22.725
nothing-face?

14:22.127 --> 14:24.233
Because this body fit.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.793
Lee stays
a nothing-face

14:26.833 --> 14:29.166
till he finds
the right self.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.470
Can't live
in the wrong self.

14:38.482 --> 14:40.555
Charlie quiet.

14:41.970 --> 14:45.448
- Charlie thinking.
- Thinking what?

14:47.338 --> 14:49.994
just about going back to Earth
after all this time.

14:50.729 --> 14:52.556
Don't want to?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.506
I don't know.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.346
On Earth, I was
just a big nobody.

14:59.381 --> 15:01.770
I had one friend...

15:01.813 --> 15:03.537
and he was
just a kid.

15:03.574 --> 15:05.679
- Brad.
- Yeah.

15:07.734 --> 15:09.557
Hey, hey, uh...

15:09.590 --> 15:12.011
you wouldn't just leave me
on Earth, would you?

15:13.335 --> 15:15.888
Charlie bounty hunter.

15:18.422 --> 15:20.522
Yeah...

15:20.902 --> 15:22.389
yeah, Charlie
bounty hunter.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.451
You guys are okay,
you know that?

15:31.256 --> 15:33.875
# At the Hungry Heifer #

15:33.912 --> 15:38.223
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

15:38.266 --> 15:40.175
How about some buffalo chips
or a Moo shake?

15:40.218 --> 15:42.323
We've got a two-for-one
Easter special.

15:42.362 --> 15:44.369
No, thanks.

15:45.850 --> 15:47.737
Wesley.
What are you doing here?

15:47.770 --> 15:49.559
Let's have us
a beer.

15:49.595 --> 15:51.253
Don't you get it?

15:52.540 --> 15:55.917
Let's just say
I'm not the Van Halen type.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.854
All right!

15:56.892 --> 15:59.947
I hate elevator
music too.

15:59.164 --> 16:01.019
Look...

16:01.188 --> 16:03.420
what other choice
you got?

16:05.818 --> 16:08.019
Wesley, I've got to go
to work! Leave me alone!

16:08.269 --> 16:09.949
Leave her alone.

16:12.893 --> 16:15.950
Just, you know...
cool it, okay?

16:17.245 --> 16:19.187
Well, looky here.

16:21.501 --> 16:23.251
Little Bradley Brown.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.274
I haven't seen you
in a long time, peewee.

16:25.312 --> 16:27.702
How's your little
space monsters?

16:27.744 --> 16:30.442
I don't want to start
any trouble, okay, Wesley?

16:30.421 --> 16:32.251
Did you hear that?

16:32.288 --> 16:35.289
The little mouse
don't want any trouble.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.150
Well, that's too bad.

16:41.570 --> 16:44.352
I'm warning you,
I've been taking karate.

16:44.385 --> 16:46.144
I don't want anyone
getting hurt,

16:46.434 --> 16:47.457
so just keep
your distance.

16:50.434 --> 16:52.890
Somebody call the sheriff!

17:00.004 --> 17:02.355
Shouldn't have
come back, asshole!

17:02.746 --> 17:03.806
Nobody wants you here!

17:05.156 --> 17:06.617
Thanks for
the getaway. I'm...

17:06.660 --> 17:08.385
Bradley Brown.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.387
Do I know you?
Did we go to school together?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.502
You used to throw cherry bombs
in the trash cans.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.201
Are you a senior?

17:15.238 --> 17:16.666
Yup.

17:19.527 --> 17:22.493
- What?
- Ponytail and braces.

17:22.534 --> 17:26.016
- And zits.
- You're Megan Morgan?!

17:27.686 --> 17:29.629
Does your dad still run
the newspaper?

17:29.671 --> 17:31.266
I'm a reporter there.

17:31.305 --> 17:32.581
Really?!

17:32.617 --> 17:35.366
Kinda like a "Jimmy Olsen"
with breasts.

17:44.746 --> 17:47.430
Chili, chow!

17:52.234 --> 17:53.478
Well, shit.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.213
I reckon you'll come back
when you get hungry.

18:10.701 --> 18:12.709
But I'm going home.

18:20.045 --> 18:22.468
Mr. Quigley? Len?!

18:22.510 --> 18:24.365
Are you here?

18:24.399 --> 18:27.531
Nana, it's scary
in here.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.542
It's okay, hon.

18:29.583 --> 18:32.197
Nothing here
can hurt you.

18:32.597 --> 18:35.461
Especially no dead frog.

18:35.504 --> 18:37.806
- Don't touch that!
- I didn't hurt it!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.728
Never mind that, Len.

18:39.761 --> 18:42.696
Where are those Easter eggs
you called me about?

18:42.737 --> 18:44.712
Oh, they're
in the back.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.755
Where on Earth
did you get these, Len?!

18:58.419 --> 19:00.881
They're from Europe.

19:02.292 --> 19:05.161
What are you
asking for these?

19:05.203 --> 19:07.244
Uh...

19:07.284 --> 19:08.691
10 bucks... each.

19:09.845 --> 19:12.943
That's not what you'd ask
the church, now, is it?

19:12.981 --> 19:14.956
Oh, of course not.

19:14.998 --> 19:16.208
Of course not!

19:16.245 --> 19:20.504
I'll give you $20
for the stack.

19:20.934 --> 19:21.492
You can have
half for $25.

19:21.526 --> 19:23.501
- 20.
- For half.

19:27.415 --> 19:30.317
These really are
special, aren't they?

19:30.360 --> 19:32.815
Yeah, really.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.416
- How long are you in town?
- Just through Easter vacation.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.904
- Where do you guys live now?
- Up in Kansas City.

19:49.945 --> 19:52.761
KC, K or KC, MO?

19:52.795 --> 19:55.216
This isn't for
"The Gazette," is it?

19:55.258 --> 19:58.291
I'm thinking of going to college
there next year, okay?

19:58.330 --> 20:02.469
Sorry, I just get nervous
with reporters and stuff.

20:02.449 --> 20:04.848
'Cause of all that talk
about those...

20:04.187 --> 20:06.326
space monsters
a couple years ago?

20:07.676 --> 20:09.847
No such thing
as any "space monsters."

20:09.883 --> 20:12.568
Really?

20:12.606 --> 20:16.533
Yeah, that was just a stupid kid's
dumb dream. It never happened.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.368
Oh, thanks for
helping me, honey.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.717
And for being such a good girl,
I've got a present for you.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.832
- What?
- Just wait.

20:51.695 --> 20:53.178
Wow, a chocolate bunny!

20:53.217 --> 20:56.065
It's better than chocolate,
honey, it's carob!

20:57.218 --> 20:59.641
You might as well
take one of these too.

21:01.026 --> 21:04.343
- Thanks, Nana.
- Happy Easter, darling.

21:11.077 --> 21:12.670
Shit.

21:12.707 --> 21:14.977
Easter sucks.

21:45.862 --> 21:48.213
Jeez-oh-peese.

21:55.978 --> 21:58.018
What the...?

22:15.820 --> 22:17.576
Chili Dog?

22:18.796 --> 22:20.455
Chili, boy.

22:20.493 --> 22:22.407
Chili?

22:22.787 --> 22:24.230
Chili, wake up, boy.

23:02.290 --> 23:05.553
Looks like someone's
getting sleepy.

23:05.873 --> 23:06.732
Not me!

23:06.771 --> 23:09.008
Go on. You want to be
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

23:09.043 --> 23:11.280
for the big Easter egg hunt
tomorrow morning.

23:11.315 --> 23:13.864
But I'm not
sleepy yet, Daddy.

23:13.204 --> 23:14.960
- Really!
- Uh-huh.

23:14.995 --> 23:16.785
Come on,
I'll tuck you in.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.828
Okay...

23:18.869 --> 23:20.429
"Okay..."

23:20.469 --> 23:23.403
- 'Night, brat.
- 'Night, creep.

23:30.389 --> 23:32.278
Super daughter.

23:34.797 --> 23:37.036
- Want to get under the covers?
- No, it's too hot.

23:37.078 --> 23:39.283
Oh, okay. 'Night, night,
sleep tight.

23:39.319 --> 23:41.075
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

23:41.237 --> 23:43.307
I'll just bite it
right back!

23:43.717 --> 23:44.786
Yeah. Oh...
uh-oh!

23:44.824 --> 23:46.831
What's that
in your hair?

23:46.872 --> 23:49.043
'Night, Daddy,
I love you.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.259
I love you, too.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.225
I'm going to bed now,
Bradley.

24:10.267 --> 24:12.055
Don't stay up
too late.

24:38.303 --> 24:40.441
You knew no one
would believe it.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.268
Didn't you?

24:44.320 --> 24:46.621
I sure do
miss you, Charlie.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.300
Where did you go?

26:29.005 --> 26:31.526
Honey, are you all right?

26:33.324 --> 26:35.300
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

26:35.342 --> 26:37.928
- Your Easter candy's a real mess.
- Ewww...

27:03.057 --> 27:05.904
Would you look at this?

27:05.938 --> 27:09.004
You ladies are doing
a wonderful job.

27:10.002 --> 27:12.425
Now, Reverend!

27:12.467 --> 27:14.702
Those are
for the children.

27:14.739 --> 27:17.425
The Easter
Bunny's here.

27:17.585 --> 27:19.505
Right on time.

27:19.539 --> 27:22.441
Midge, would you bring
the sheriff his package?

27:22.483 --> 27:24.753
- Here you go.
- There you are.

27:24.789 --> 27:27.570
Are you sure you couldn't get
somebody else to do this?

27:27.604 --> 27:30.125
Sheriff Harv did it
for 20 years running.

27:30.507 --> 27:32.257
Well, I ain't
Sheriff Harv!

27:32.667 --> 27:34.548
Don't be
such a gloomy Gus.

27:34.581 --> 27:36.752
Sheriff, just help us out.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.954
Who knows, you might even
have yourself a good time.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.030
Fat chance.

27:42.070 --> 27:44.525
Well, you better
hurry, ladies.

27:44.567 --> 27:47.316
- Resurrection's in 45 minutes.
- Oh!

27:47.351 --> 27:49.900
- Put this down on the other side.
- Okay, Emily.

27:49.239 --> 27:51.280
Spread them out
so they're all even.

28:10.234 --> 28:12.122
Good morning,
children.

28:12.352 --> 28:13.910
Happy Easter.

28:13.946 --> 28:15.856
We're going to have
to be patient today.

28:15.899 --> 28:19.743
We can't start the hunt
until the services are over.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.676
I have it on good authority
that the Easter Bunny himself

28:22.716 --> 28:24.571
just might make
an appearance.

28:26.523 --> 28:27.767
Go on now!

28:39.517 --> 28:40.924
Thank you.

28:45.246 --> 28:47.581
Boy, pretty good
crowd today.

28:51.679 --> 28:55.088
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

28:57.824 --> 29:01.534
- I thought he was gone!
- He's trouble.

29:01.568 --> 29:04.289
...back here.
- That's him.

29:06.081 --> 29:07.904
Brad!

29:07.937 --> 29:10.785
Welcome, friends.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.760
Welcome one and all.

29:14.273 --> 29:17.470
Today, of course,
is the Day of Resurrection.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.873
So it seems only fitting

29:19.907 --> 29:22.624
that some of you
have chosen this day

29:22.659 --> 29:25.742
to resurrect
your church-going habit.

29:30.947 --> 29:33.948
Why'd I ever let her
talk me into this?

29:39.622 --> 29:42.753
Honey, that's
awfully beautiful.

30:39.597 --> 30:41.637
Aw, this is great.

30:41.677 --> 30:44.133
The Easter Bunny with
his Tehachapi hanging out.

30:45.326 --> 30:47.497
It'd give them kids
a real education.

31:08.657 --> 31:11.854
What the hell was in you?

31:24.914 --> 31:27.402
...and entering
into the sepulcher,

31:27.443 --> 31:31.501
they saw, sitting
on the right side,

31:31.539 --> 31:33.646
a young man...

31:33.685 --> 31:36.717
clothed in a long,
white garment.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.984
And they were
afrighted.

32:09.497 --> 32:11.918
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.111
There you are.

32:26.765 --> 32:28.945
My dad just ran
your grandma home.

32:28.283 --> 32:30.355
Are you okay?

32:30.394 --> 32:32.534
Yeah, I'm all right.

32:33.756 --> 32:35.927
What do you think
happened to the sheriff?

32:37.616 --> 32:40.660
You heard 'em. It was probably
some kind of farm accident.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.002
Farm accident?!
You saw him!

32:43.035 --> 32:45.110
That was no
farm accident.

32:45.149 --> 32:46.293
What are you
trying to say?

32:46.333 --> 32:48.603
You were telling the truth
about those things.

32:48.637 --> 32:51.355
- There are no such things!
- I don't believe you.

32:52.830 --> 32:54.685
I mean, I do
believe you.

32:54.718 --> 32:58.015
I mean, I believe what
you said a couple years ago.

32:58.046 --> 33:00.315
Do me a favor and don't
do me any favors, okay?

33:00.352 --> 33:03.680
Don't you think
we better go see Harv?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.323
Well, I'm going.

33:09.440 --> 33:10.815
Megan...

33:28.739 --> 33:30.430
Harv?!

33:34.722 --> 33:37.341
We need you in town, something
awful's happened at the church.

33:37.381 --> 33:39.289
What the hell are
you doing here, boy?

33:39.331 --> 33:42.081
We think it might have
been those... creatures.

33:44.580 --> 33:47.135
What creatures
would that be?

33:46.308 --> 33:48.512
- It's true, Harv.
- You see 'em?

33:48.549 --> 33:49.957
Not exactly, but I...

33:49.989 --> 33:53.596
Then don't be bringing me grief!
You go tell the sheriff.

33:53.956 --> 33:56.800
- The sheriff is dead!
- They got him up at the church.

33:59.334 --> 34:00.960
His stomach
was eaten out.

34:00.998 --> 34:04.163
Folks are saying it was some farm
machine accident, but it wasn't.

34:04.388 --> 34:07.134
You have to come with us, Harv!
What are you doing?

34:07.175 --> 34:09.510
What does it look like
I'm doing, Einstein?

34:09.543 --> 34:11.551
I'm doing what
any intelligent,

34:11.592 --> 34:14.819
God-fearing
Grover Benders would do!

34:14.280 --> 34:15.808
I'm haulin' ass!

34:15.849 --> 34:18.549
You can't leave now!
This town needs you!

34:18.869 --> 34:22.755
Yeah? This town
voted me out in a landslide.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.476
This town can
kiss my ass!

34:28.107 --> 34:30.659
I can't believe you're
just going to run away.

34:31.722 --> 34:33.927
We need you, Harv.
We need a sheriff.

34:33.963 --> 34:36.549
Go check the yellow pages.

35:38.964 --> 35:40.752
hi...

35:40.788 --> 35:42.446
this here's
American culture.

35:42.483 --> 35:44.109
Good reading.

35:44.147 --> 35:45.741
G-Good articles.

35:45.781 --> 35:47.820
Transform.

35:53.366 --> 35:54.511
Oh no, Lee.

35:54.549 --> 35:56.459
No, no, Lee.
Don't look at me, Lee!

36:35.930 --> 36:37.753
Kill Crites.

36:45.339 --> 36:47.608
Hey, guys!
Hey, wait up!

36:48.636 --> 36:50.611
Hey, Lee!

36:52.796 --> 36:55.187
Lee, you're gonna
need this!

36:59.037 --> 37:02.137
Okay, let's think about this. Maybe
there is a logical explanation.

37:02.174 --> 37:04.378
What do you mean?
Like really bad stomach ulcers?

37:04.414 --> 37:06.105
It could have
been a dog!

37:06.143 --> 37:08.893
Yeah, and it could have been
the brain from Planet Eros.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.967
You saw him, Brad.
It was no dog.

37:14.143 --> 37:15.703
What's the matter?

37:15.745 --> 37:19.160
I need a little air. I was going
home to take a hot bath and I see...

37:19.200 --> 37:21.568
- Slow down.
- Rolling, rolling, towards me...

37:21.600 --> 37:23.870
- It's getting bigger and bigger...
- Take a breath!

37:23.904 --> 37:25.464
And it's got
these big teeth...

37:25.505 --> 37:28.094
- Where did it go?!
- Into Quigley's.

37:27.330 --> 37:30.111
- Mr. Quigley!
- Get in the truck. Lock the doors.

37:30.146 --> 37:31.739
You can't go.
Let's get help!

37:31.778 --> 37:34.168
Who are we gonna call?
Critter Busters?

37:34.706 --> 37:35.868
Just stay behind me
in the truck!

38:03.942 --> 38:06.942
Mr. Quigley?

38:08.678 --> 38:10.403
Anybody home?

38:11.750 --> 38:13.824
Mr. Quigley,
are you okay?

38:18.439 --> 38:20.480
Nobody's home.
Let's get out of here.

38:23.528 --> 38:25.950
Get up!

38:25.993 --> 38:27.935
Bradley,
look behind you!

38:27.977 --> 38:30.595
Get in the truck!

38:31.593 --> 38:32.543
Get in!

38:34.314 --> 38:36.769
- Roll up the window!
- It's broken!

38:36.810 --> 38:39.177
- Come on!
- God damn it!

38:39.210 --> 38:41.796
Come on, come on!

38:41.834 --> 38:43.973
- You're flooding it!
- Then you drive!

38:46.732 --> 38:48.487
Dear God,
that critter thing!

38:49.708 --> 38:52.010
Get away,
I am not kidding!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.593
Yuck, veggies, ugh!

39:33.457 --> 39:35.399
Nana, the critters
are here.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.449
No, shit, Bradley!

39:37.491 --> 39:39.879
Damn meat eaters!

39:41.489 --> 39:44.174
Where are you going?
Bradley!

39:53.460 --> 39:55.632
- Where's the communicator?
- What communicator?

39:55.669 --> 39:57.741
The one the bounty hunters
gave to me.

39:57.781 --> 39:59.668
Bounty hunters?!

39:59.700 --> 40:03.174
- The space guys.
- Oh, you mean the remote control.

40:02.357 --> 40:04.724
- It's always on the TV.
- Not the remote control.

40:04.757 --> 40:06.928
Nana, this is not
the remote control.

40:34.073 --> 40:36.376
Those bounty hunters!

40:36.409 --> 40:38.918
That was fast.

40:39.385 --> 40:41.972
- More Crites.
- Yeah, a lot more.

40:42.010 --> 40:44.377
Boy am I glad
to see you.

40:45.754 --> 40:47.097
B-both of you.

40:48.636 --> 40:50.424
These guys are great.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.632
Charlie!

41:03.516 --> 41:04.661
Brad.

41:08.542 --> 41:10.201
I can't believe it!

41:10.732 --> 41:12.474
Look at you... all dressed up
like one of them.

41:12.510 --> 41:15.824
Well, I am one of them.
I'm a bounty hunter.

41:16.163 --> 41:17.049
Yeah, right.

41:17.087 --> 41:18.843
No, no, no.
I work with them.

41:18.878 --> 41:21.596
Are you still...?

41:23.423 --> 41:26.173
I don't need that anymore.
See... see...

41:26.208 --> 41:28.095
up in space,
I am somebody.

41:28.128 --> 41:30.135
See, I got a job
and a meaning.

41:33.057 --> 41:36.056
So I guess that means
you won't be staying long then.

41:39.138 --> 41:40.217
Probably not.

41:41.441 --> 41:43.837
B-but, see, Brad...

41:44.167 --> 41:45.786
I gotta go where
the cosmic winds blow me.

41:47.650 --> 41:49.058
I gotta...

41:49.090 --> 41:50.749
go...

41:50.786 --> 41:53.122
where no man
has gone before.

41:54.608 --> 41:57.691
Well, it's really good
to have you back, Charlie.

41:59.849 --> 42:01.689
Even if it's just
for a little while.

43:05.836 --> 43:08.587
Hey, wait!
Help us out over here.

43:10.701 --> 43:12.970
- That guy's crazy.
- Don't go in there.

43:19.950 --> 43:22.667
# Hey, little buddies,
come gather 'round #

43:22.702 --> 43:25.518
# This here's the very best
eating in town #

43:25.551 --> 43:27.918
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

43:27.952 --> 43:30.440
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

43:30.479 --> 43:33.032
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

43:33.071 --> 43:35.625
# And wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

43:35.665 --> 43:38.184
# Pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

43:38.224 --> 43:41.772
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

43:41.809 --> 43:44.427
# At the Hungry Heifer #

43:44.466 --> 43:47.913
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

45:00.828 --> 45:03.128
Get out of the way!

45:10.621 --> 45:13.664
Operator?! Operator,
can you hear me? Please listen,

45:14.024 --> 45:16.123
I can't hear you. This is
the editor of the "Gazette."

45:16.157 --> 45:18.395
We need to get the highway
patrol here right away.

45:18.430 --> 45:21.496
Operator, can you... oh, God.

45:25.151 --> 45:27.517
Oh my God.
I can't hear you.

45:27.551 --> 45:29.755
All I can hear is static.
If you're there...

45:29.790 --> 45:32.791
can you hear me?
Can anybody out there hear me?

45:52.097 --> 45:53.658
Daddy?

45:54.785 --> 45:57.820
- Thank God!

45:57.857 --> 46:00.673
- The critters are real.
- I know.

46:00.707 --> 46:02.748
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:04.834 --> 46:06.078
Did you guys hear that?

46:06.116 --> 46:08.253
Let's get to the door.

46:15.461 --> 46:17.762
- Oh no! Daddy!
- Get him up, come on!

46:18.949 --> 46:21.933
- Go!
- For God's sake!

46:22.662 --> 46:25.673
- Wesley!
- Wesley!

46:27.911 --> 46:29.634
Chickenshit!

46:50.026 --> 46:52.392
Go on inside. You'll be
much safer in there.

46:52.425 --> 46:54.565
I need some more
bandages.

46:56.139 --> 46:57.895
Daddy!

46:59.018 --> 47:01.737
- Cindy, are you okay?
- What happened to Daddy?

47:01.771 --> 47:03.876
Don't worry,
he's gonna be all right.

47:14.060 --> 47:15.075
Shit!

47:27.695 --> 47:30.116
Ug, what happened?

47:30.158 --> 47:32.231
Crites feed
together.

47:32.271 --> 47:33.897
Eat like a family.

47:33.935 --> 47:36.837
Love meat.
A bad habit.

47:36.879 --> 47:38.952
You guys
don't eat meat?!

47:38.991 --> 47:41.130
Hey, who's gonna pay
for all this stuff?!

47:41.168 --> 47:42.990
Look at the mess
you guys made!

47:47.441 --> 47:49.677
No, Lee,
no, no, don't...

47:49.713 --> 47:51.120
not this!
No, Lee!

48:09.138 --> 48:11.279
Kill more Crites.

48:21.128 --> 48:22.096
l-I gotta go, Brad.

49:19.451 --> 49:21.788
Sorry.

49:23.549 --> 49:25.458
It sure is quiet.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.574
Maybe they're all dead.

49:27.613 --> 49:29.686
I wish.

49:31.165 --> 49:33.467
They're probably
waiting right outside.

49:34.590 --> 49:37.406
There's a cheery thought.

49:39.454 --> 49:42.041
It's like they're
teasing us or something.

49:44.159 --> 49:46.494
I just wish I knew
where they were.

49:54.913 --> 49:56.735
Lee?

50:08.822 --> 50:10.296
Lee?

50:10.662 --> 50:13.154
Lee?!

50:15.556 --> 50:17.410
What are you doing?

50:19.524 --> 50:21.150
No! No, no, no!

50:21.188 --> 50:22.715
No, Lee, please!

50:30.085 --> 50:31.678
Hold it, Lee.
Hold on.

50:31.717 --> 50:33.921
This is the one.
This... now, this...

50:33.959 --> 50:35.966
This... that's it.

50:36.005 --> 50:37.827
Good, that's it.

50:41.288 --> 50:42.978
Kill Crites.

50:44.199 --> 50:45.988
Thank you.

51:54.799 --> 51:57.615
Sweet Jesus!
What was that?

52:03.250 --> 52:05.224
Lee?

52:07.634 --> 52:09.871
Ug, what happened?

52:09.906 --> 52:12.012
Where's Lee?

52:47.768 --> 52:49.906
Ug's losing it.

53:26.812 --> 53:28.917
Charlie,
what happened?

53:28.957 --> 53:30.844
Lee's dead.

53:30.877 --> 53:32.700
What happened to...

53:32.734 --> 53:34.959
Ug?

53:39.619 --> 53:41.690
Is he okay?

53:42.090 --> 53:44.439
- He ain't breathing.
- He don't have a mouth.

53:49.694 --> 53:52.062
Try and transform, Ug.

53:57.983 --> 53:59.839
Ug...

54:02.688 --> 54:05.918
I'm not a good enough bounty hunter
to do it by myself.

54:47.078 --> 54:49.535
Hey, get back inside!

54:49.575 --> 54:50.884
Go on!

54:53.575 --> 54:55.844
If you don't get inside
I'm going to see to it

54:55.879 --> 54:57.569
your dad blisters
your little butt!

55:12.298 --> 55:14.054
Get inside
and lock the door.

56:09.969 --> 56:12.107
I'm back.

56:17.618 --> 56:19.341
Cindy?

56:19.631 --> 56:21.004
Cindy!

56:22.930 --> 56:25.548
Looks like we got us
a job to do.

57:06.200 --> 57:08.983
- Did you hear that?
- Uh-huh.

57:09.016 --> 57:10.740
- What was it?

57:14.717 --> 57:15.538
Look!

57:16.697 --> 57:18.521
Where are
they all going?

57:18.554 --> 57:20.463
I don't know.

57:20.505 --> 57:23.858
Looks like some kind of
critter convention.

57:39.293 --> 57:41.911
There must be
hundreds of them.

57:48.561 --> 57:50.935
We can't call
in the highway patrol.

57:50.974 --> 57:53.243
All the damn
phone lines are down.

57:53.278 --> 57:56.060
We've got to do something.
We can't just stay here!

57:56.095 --> 57:59.062
Those things got the west road
out of town blocked.

57:59.103 --> 58:01.973
- We're never gonna get past them.
- Same goes for the east.

58:02.015 --> 58:05.146
Listen, this is
the safest place we can be!

58:05.184 --> 58:07.901
Now, I say we stay here and wait
the little bastards out.

58:07.935 --> 58:10.588
- These things won't leave.
- Mind your own business, boy!

58:10.624 --> 58:13.195
This is my business!

58:12.480 --> 58:15.197
They don't give up! We have
to fight them and kill them.

58:15.232 --> 58:17.207
Seems mighty queer to me...

58:17.249 --> 58:20.236
two years ago when
the critters first come,

58:19.490 --> 58:21.115
they come
to the boy's house.

58:21.154 --> 58:23.642
The boy's back in town and
the damn things are here too!

58:23.683 --> 58:26.749
I've been through this before!
We have to fight these things!

58:26.786 --> 58:28.675
We don't include you.

58:28.707 --> 58:32.352
Now, I ain't listening to no
undersized kid from the big city.

58:32.567 --> 58:35.487
Or no town drunk!
Or no no-faced spaceman

58:35.524 --> 58:39.070
out of a flying saucer telling us
how to run our own town!

58:39.108 --> 58:41.695
We didn't have this trouble
till the boy came back.

58:41.732 --> 58:44.995
Let's not get hysterical here. That
boy saved my little girl's life.

58:45.029 --> 58:47.232
This ain't no show of yours
either, Morgan.

58:47.269 --> 58:49.474
I say the boy's
bad news in shoes.

58:57.223 --> 58:59.523
What is this bullshit?

59:02.311 --> 59:05.628
Them man-eating dustmops
got us roped up tighter

59:05.671 --> 59:08.093
than a blue-ribbon bull
and all you folks can do

59:08.135 --> 59:11.616
is stand here and play
kick-the-can with some punk kid!

59:12.968 --> 59:15.620
If we set around here
on our duffs...

59:15.657 --> 59:17.283
bitching...

59:17.321 --> 59:20.289
we're gonna end up
tomorrow's leftovers.

59:20.330 --> 59:22.566
I don't too much
relish that idea.

59:22.602 --> 59:24.936
I think it's time
to fight back.

59:26.859 --> 59:30.054
- We gotta blow them up.
- Oh, come on, boy!

59:30.091 --> 59:33.058
No, no, I mean it! Go out
in the field and see for yourselves.

59:33.098 --> 59:35.302
The critters are eating
the cattle out there.

59:35.339 --> 59:38.154
It's just like Ug said,
they get together to feed.

59:38.187 --> 59:40.970
So let's put out the most outrageous
banquet in the world for them.

59:41.004 --> 59:42.827
What have you
got in mind, son?

59:42.860 --> 59:45.479
Polar Burgers! We'll get them
into the hamburger factory,

59:45.517 --> 59:47.208
lock them in
and then blow them up!

59:47.245 --> 59:49.546
Who's gonna lead
this suicide mission?

59:56.781 --> 59:58.538
Well...

59:58.575 --> 01:00:00.548
it was my idea.

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.979
But I'm gonna
need some help.

01:00:07.759 --> 01:00:09.166
Well...

01:00:10.895 --> 01:00:12.173
I'm in.

01:00:14.256 --> 01:00:16.525
I'll go.

01:00:18.097 --> 01:00:20.562
Really?!

01:00:22.225 --> 01:00:24.592
All right, you all
just volunteered.

01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:27.047
Come on, you bunch
of pussies.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.953
You've got nothing
to lose but your lives.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.847
I'll get the gate!

01:01:18.521 --> 01:01:20.145
Go!

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.199
Armed and dangerous,
everybody.

01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:54.688
Oh my God!

01:02:54.724 --> 01:02:56.612
It's working!

01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:03.942
Let's roll.

01:03:13.843 --> 01:03:15.520
Oh my God.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.894
Harv, Harv!

01:03:21.244 --> 01:03:22.146
Company's coming.

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:09.037
Wait up!

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.855
Hey, don't piss
them off!

01:04:31.889 --> 01:04:35.534
Keep your distance.
Stay downwind of them things.

01:05:06.389 --> 01:05:08.859
Everybody, ready?
Here they come.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.007
Oh dear God.

01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:46.351
Great.

01:05:46.394 --> 01:05:47.801
They stopped.

01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:58.098
Oh shit.

01:06:00.892 --> 01:06:02.834
Charlie, come back here!

01:06:03.868 --> 01:06:05.593
Charlie!

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.839
They're coming back.

01:06:58.051 --> 01:07:00.922
- Brad, I think it's gonna work.
- Shhh.

01:07:03.108 --> 01:07:05.213
Where did that
big one come from?

01:07:26.823 --> 01:07:28.612
Oh my God.

01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:30.777
Look at the size
of their leader.

01:07:47.273 --> 01:07:49.162
Brad...

01:08:16.589 --> 01:08:17.899
Ug.

01:08:17.934 --> 01:08:20.390
It's the bounty hunter.
He led them back.

01:08:22.926 --> 01:08:24.586
The door!

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:38.410
Run! Blow it,
blow it!

01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:14.893
We fried 'em!

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.988
Are you okay?

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.791
Yeah. It's just ketchup.

01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:23.216
Close one, though.

01:09:32.312 --> 01:09:34.452
Get back, she's gonna
blow again!

01:09:57.286 --> 01:09:58.328
Son of a bitch.

01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:25.213
Harv, it's heading
back to town.

01:10:25.246 --> 01:10:29.022
Ohhh, Lord, Harv,
the children!

01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:30.812
- Come on.
- Let's go!

01:10:48.258 --> 01:10:50.080
Come on!

01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:53.591
Come on, faster!

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:05.114
They're heading for town!
Come on!

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.042
Oh my God, I bet it's headed
for the church.

01:11:10.085 --> 01:11:11.743
We gotta stop it!

01:11:23.878 --> 01:11:26.628
Inside, quick.
Quickly!

01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:28.968
Honey, do what he says.
Get inside.

01:11:31.846 --> 01:11:33.669
Brad, look out!

01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:43.745
Ram it, ram it!

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:48.290
I'm gonna hit it!

01:12:06.763 --> 01:12:08.902
- Come on!
- Run, run!

01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:18.444
Look!

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:22.917
I'm a bounty hunter!!

01:12:57.203 --> 01:12:59.209
Charlie...

01:13:00.989 --> 01:13:02.635
You mean that...

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:04.585
Charlie...?

01:13:24.885 --> 01:13:27.122
Good ol' Charlie.

01:13:39.159 --> 01:13:41.584
Brad, look at Ug.

01:14:12.316 --> 01:14:15.129
Well, just go
on in, huh?

01:14:14.589 --> 01:14:17.076
You practically got
the whole run of the bus.

01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:23.992
Goodbye, Brad.

01:14:25.084 --> 01:14:27.027
Goodbye, Charlie...

01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:27.998
I mean... Ug.

01:14:29.662 --> 01:14:31.004
Charlie.

01:14:32.765 --> 01:14:35.832
- Thanks, Nana. Love ya.
- I love you, too.

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:37.627
And here. Here's a...

01:14:37.662 --> 01:14:39.753
spinach-cashew
cake I made.

01:14:40.092 --> 01:14:41.462
Eat it if you
get hungry.

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:44.254
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:14:52.064 --> 01:14:55.229
Get a move on, son,
this bus runs on a schedule.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.480
I guess I'll be
seeing ya.

01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:07.328
Come on, son. Kiss your little
gal and let's haul ass.

01:15:12.771 --> 01:15:14.397
Holy shit!

01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:21.315
Hey, can one of you guys help me
get this parachute off?

01:15:23.014 --> 01:15:24.901
Charlie?

01:15:24.935 --> 01:15:27.138
Oh, I got it.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.907
Charlie.

01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:36.829
Hi.

01:15:46.215 --> 01:15:48.103
Ug?

01:15:48.136 --> 01:15:50.130
Charlie?

01:17:20.789 --> 01:17:23.483
Say, listen...

01:17:22.644 --> 01:17:24.205
what just
happened here?

01:17:24.243 --> 01:17:25.934
If I was you, partner,

01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:28.077
I'd roll this rig
right outta town,

01:17:28.117 --> 01:17:30.754
and not say nothin' about
none of this to nobody.

01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:36.401
Bye, Megan.

01:17:36.438 --> 01:17:38.859
Bye, Brad.

01:18:02.329 --> 01:18:04.947
Hey, Charlie!
Catch!

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:09.246
# Hey, little buddies
come gather 'round #

01:19:08.641 --> 01:19:11.260
# This here's the very best
eatin' in town #

01:19:11.299 --> 01:19:13.688
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

01:19:13.731 --> 01:19:16.382
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:18.874
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

01:19:18.915 --> 01:19:22.228
# Wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

01:19:21.634 --> 01:19:24.091
# You'll pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

01:19:24.132 --> 01:19:27.448
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

01:19:27.491 --> 01:19:30.241
# At the Hungry Heifer #

01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:34.467
# We won't give you
a bum steer... #

01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:37.631
And don't you forget,

01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:40.988
all of your friendly Hungry Heifer
restaurants throughout the Midwest

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:43.681

So after church,

01:19:43.719 --> 01:19:46.948
why don't you and your family

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.871
or some crispy
buffalo chips?

01:19:48.903 --> 01:19:51.270

you and your family

01:19:51.304 --> 01:19:53.474

of Grover's Bend.

01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:57.347
We'd love to see ya!

01:19:57.384 --> 01:19:59.143
Moo-ve.

01:19:59.513 --> 01:20:01.348
