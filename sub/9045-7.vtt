00:00.333 --> 00:02.210
<i>Previously on</i> Awkward.

00:02.376 --> 00:03.253
Jenna, I like you.

00:03.419 --> 00:06.089
I'm just not sure
I'm ready to be in a relationship.

00:06.647 --> 00:08.175
Everyone thinks
I tried to kill myself,

00:08.341 --> 00:10.135
and there's a lame guy
selling T-shirts

00:10.301 --> 00:11.219
keeping the stupid story alive.

00:11.385 --> 00:13.555
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton!
- What?

00:16.766 --> 00:19.844
It's obviously, uh,
a very important day.

00:20.902 --> 00:23.317
In high school, attention was a drug.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.567
Everyone was jonesing for it.

00:26.984 --> 00:28.528
Including Principal Cox.

00:28.694 --> 00:29.738
So you can all talk.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.200
Okay, hum,

00:33.366 --> 00:36.616
now, to tell you more,
about drunk driving awareness day,

00:37.147 --> 00:37.996
Miss Marks.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.796
Check, one two.

00:47.513 --> 00:49.046
Hot mic.
[Clears throat]

00:49.048 --> 00:52.817
This year, our annual play
to raise drunk driving awareness

00:52.819 --> 00:55.973
is gonna be
driven into the millennia.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.142
Everybody, welcome to <i>Crash'd!</i>

00:59.308 --> 01:03.647
Same characters,
same story, new flava.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.864
It stands for counselors, me,

01:06.866 --> 01:10.070
raising awareness for students,

01:10.236 --> 01:11.405
you,

01:11.571 --> 01:15.273
who, "W" is silent, drink.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.741
I knew that'd get your attention.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.442
Attention was weird.

01:18.444 --> 01:21.456
The people who had it
seemed not to want it,

01:21.622 --> 01:24.115
and the people who didn't have it

01:24.117 --> 01:26.003
seemed to want nothing more.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.672
Ricky Schwartz is acting
all stranger than fiction.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.021
Ever since his parents
took him off his meds,

01:30.023 --> 01:32.056
he stopped checking me out.

01:32.058 --> 01:35.095
Refocusing attention
was my current strategy.

01:35.261 --> 01:39.266
I was playing hard to get
with a guy that was hard to get.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.032
It seemed to be working,

01:41.034 --> 01:43.668
and I wasn't going to give in
to Matty's private sexcapades

01:43.670 --> 01:45.939
until I got some public attention.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.471
[Clearing throat]
And now, Palos Hillers,

01:47.473 --> 01:49.207
it's time to announce the leads

01:49.209 --> 01:51.778
of this year's mock D.U.I. car crash.

01:55.113 --> 01:57.915
And the role of Dead Johnny
goes to...

01:57.917 --> 01:59.383
Jake Rosati.

01:59.385 --> 02:06.724
[Applause]

02:06.726 --> 02:09.920
And the role of Dead Stacey
goes to...

02:10.086 --> 02:12.096
This part's all mine.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.551
Jenna Hamilton.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.137
[Light applause]

02:17.303 --> 02:20.974
It was not the kind of
attention I was looking for.

02:27.813 --> 02:28.879
[School bell rings]

02:28.881 --> 02:30.448
What up, dead Stacey?

02:30.450 --> 02:32.116
There's no way
I'm playing Dead Stacey.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.085
I've already had one lethal
misunderstanding this year.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.186
I don't need another.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.354
This just confirms

02:36.356 --> 02:38.589
that there is
a theater conspiracy against me.

02:38.591 --> 02:39.991
I'm gonna go tell Valerie
that I quit,

02:39.993 --> 02:40.992
and then you can play dead Stacey.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.193
Yes!

02:42.195 --> 02:44.862
Just remember,
it's all about how you die.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.430
In the classic <i>license to kill,</i>

02:46.432 --> 02:49.211
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen
dies on the hood,

02:49.377 --> 02:50.468
but in <i>Love on the rocks,</i>

02:50.470 --> 02:52.103
Tori spelling
drives into a fid of corn

02:52.105 --> 02:54.800
and disappears...
[Whispering] forever.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.142
Oh, look, they picked
the dead girl to play dead.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.443
Congrats, Jenna.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.147
You've actually become
a clichÃ© of yourself.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.685
Cliche means stupid, right?

03:05.851 --> 03:07.979
Looks like Sadie's jeal-y.

03:08.145 --> 03:09.020
Well, there's nothing
to be jealous about,

03:09.022 --> 03:11.066
because I'm not doing it.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.557
Playing dead Stacey was bigger
than being homecoming queen,

03:13.559 --> 03:15.960
but I was trying
to bury my suicide stigma,

03:15.962 --> 03:17.072
not advertise it.

03:18.297 --> 03:19.950
Oh, Jenna, hey!
You excited?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.832
No, I'm not doing it.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.370
I was actually
about to go quit right now.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.871
Whoa, hold up! Hold up.
[Chuckles]

03:25.037 --> 03:26.206
Before you, uh,

03:26.372 --> 03:28.333
kill your only chance
of being my dead girlfriend,

03:28.499 --> 03:30.775
um, I highly recommend
you reconsider.

03:30.777 --> 03:33.711
I mean, uh,
just think of all the ways

03:33.713 --> 03:35.090
I could end your life.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.175
[Sinister groan]

03:37.341 --> 03:39.517
I think you're
supposed to kill me by cocktail,

03:39.519 --> 03:40.679
not asphyxiation.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.431
[Both mouthing words]

03:45.891 --> 03:47.124
Everything okay?

03:47.126 --> 03:48.926
Other than public humiliation
and whiplash from you,

03:48.928 --> 03:50.021
I'm great.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.596
You sure?
'Cause it seems like, uh,

03:52.598 --> 03:53.692
ever since our kiss, you just seem...

03:53.858 --> 03:55.151
We're good.

03:55.317 --> 03:57.821
It just seemed like last week,
when we talked on the phone,

03:57.987 --> 03:59.239
you know, everything was cool,

03:59.405 --> 04:00.824
and then today
you're acting kinda weird, and...

04:00.990 --> 04:01.825
- Listen, Jake.
- Mm-hmm?

04:01.991 --> 04:03.160
Here are the bullet points.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.370
I'm your friend.
We had an accidental kiss,

04:05.536 --> 04:07.011
that even you said was a mistake,

04:07.013 --> 04:08.832
- because you have a girlfriend.
- Oh.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.418
And I'm not gonna
say anything, okay? I promise.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.086
I have to go quit now.

04:15.088 --> 04:19.091
There really was something to
this playing-hard-to-get thing.

04:19.257 --> 04:21.052
Whoever said, "If you build it,
they will come," was wrong.

04:21.218 --> 04:24.723
Tear it down.
They come running.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.365
Don't have to say anything,
I know why you're here.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.568
Congrats.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.169
I save this for special occasions,

04:32.171 --> 04:35.275
and this, my Jenna-ration,
is a special occasion.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.402
- It sure is.
- You know what we are, Jenna?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.237
We are pioneers.

04:39.403 --> 04:42.991
Two female pioneers
on the Oregon trail,

04:43.157 --> 04:46.016
forging the river, heading west,

04:46.018 --> 04:48.152
and even though
Mary-Beth has dysentery,

04:48.154 --> 04:49.520
we will not be stopped.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.756
We will make a difference.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.826
[Grunts]
[Whispering] Get that.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.881
- To our success tomorrow.
- I can't.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.049
It's sparkling apple juice.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.508
No, I can't be Dead Stacey.

05:00.674 --> 05:03.678
But good news. My friend,
Tamara, wants to do it.

05:03.844 --> 05:06.848
She would love... I mean die,
absolutely die for the roll.

05:07.014 --> 05:10.074
Uh, yeah, I've heard all about
Tamara from Mr. Wilkerson.

05:10.076 --> 05:10.352
That apparently...

05:10.518 --> 05:11.493
- She's a performer.
- No.

05:11.495 --> 05:12.594
No, I don't think you understand.

05:12.596 --> 05:14.397
She played Tammy in <i>Grease</i> last year.

05:14.563 --> 05:17.299
There is no Tammy.
They just made up a character,

05:17.301 --> 05:19.611
so they could kill her off
in the first five minutes.

05:21.529 --> 05:26.775
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm on what they call thin ice.

05:26.777 --> 05:29.645
Apparently, principal Cox
doesn't like the advice

05:29.647 --> 05:31.346
I give to students.

05:31.348 --> 05:33.248
Getting pregnant does suck,

05:33.250 --> 05:35.050
but breast-feeding makes you skinny.

05:35.052 --> 05:37.379
Burning and not itching, you're fine.

05:37.753 --> 05:40.465
Take a sleeping pill
and nap under my desk.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.300
Well, it sounds like
you were just trying to help.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.893
See.
That's why you're my girl.

05:44.895 --> 05:46.638
I am?
When did that happen?

05:46.804 --> 05:49.349
That is why I need your help
to make <i>Crash'd...</i>

05:49.515 --> 05:52.734
[Car crash sound effect]

05:52.736 --> 05:54.636
A success.
It's cool, huh?

05:54.638 --> 05:56.705
See, I just need to prove
to Principal Cox

05:56.707 --> 05:59.274
that can be responsible,
and since you're my girl,

05:59.276 --> 06:01.510
I know that you'll
take this event seriously.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.211
I mean, you've got my back, right?

06:03.213 --> 06:06.032
I would love nothing more
than to be Dead Stacey,

06:06.198 --> 06:09.251
but, um, considering
my recent accident,

06:09.253 --> 06:10.704
there's no way my parents will let me

06:10.870 --> 06:12.187
do the whole "Dead" thing.

06:12.189 --> 06:15.290
They're still really sensitive
about it.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.295
If it were up to me,
I'd totally do it, though.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.562
Parents don't have to know.
[Laughs]

06:20.564 --> 06:22.497
[Phone rings]

06:22.499 --> 06:24.009
Hello?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.101
Snickerdoodle.

06:26.103 --> 06:27.469
[Whispering]
God, sorry, it's my mom.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.838
How's everything going?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.173
How'd it go?
Did I get it?

06:31.175 --> 06:33.008
I've been practicing
all the ways I can die.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.477
Well, the good news,
I don't have to be Dead Stacey,

06:35.479 --> 06:38.580
the bad news, they won't
let you have the part.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.315
This reeks of Mr. Wilkerson.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.417
This has nothing to do with my talent

06:42.419 --> 06:44.863
and everything to do with his
broken dreams and his bald head.

06:45.029 --> 06:48.023
But if I can't be Dead Stacey,
you have to do it,

06:48.025 --> 06:50.692
otherwise they're gonna give it
to some nasty beast like Sadie.

06:50.694 --> 06:51.860
Let Sadie at it.

06:51.862 --> 06:55.430
I'd love to see her covered in blood.

06:55.432 --> 06:58.200
So nothing interesting
happened at school today?

06:58.202 --> 06:59.210
No altercations?

06:59.376 --> 07:00.545
Nope.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.405
And you wore underwear?

07:03.407 --> 07:05.307
Yes.

07:05.309 --> 07:08.043
So you didn't flash
your lady bits to anyone,

07:08.045 --> 07:08.887
by accident?

07:09.053 --> 07:10.096
No.

07:10.262 --> 07:11.431
Or on purpose?

07:11.597 --> 07:12.682
No one saw my vagina.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.934
Nothing happened.
What's up with the third degree?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.885
[Knocking]

07:16.887 --> 07:19.147
Hi!
It's me, Valerie.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.899
Kill. Me. Now.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.324
[Squeals]

07:22.326 --> 07:23.985
- Go around.
- Oh, okay.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.574
So this is where my girl lives.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.825
I brought gifts.

07:30.991 --> 07:34.123
For you.
It lives forever.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.790
And you, diet wine.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.625
I know how you P. V. moms
like to stay skinny.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.921
Oh! Well, I've never heard of
diet wine. [Laughs]

07:43.087 --> 07:44.266
Oh, well, it's not really diet.

07:44.268 --> 07:46.091
The grapes are organic,
runs right through ya.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.301
It's like
drinkin' the water in Mexico.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.438
[Whispering]
Throw it out.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.340
So can I get you anything, Ms....

07:51.342 --> 07:53.348
Oh, val.
Yeah, I'd love a zima.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.976
Or nothing.
Nothing's good.

07:57.142 --> 07:59.381
Would you like to sit?

07:59.383 --> 08:01.350
- Yes.
- Yes.

08:04.191 --> 08:06.855
[Clears throat]
What are you doin' here?

08:06.857 --> 08:09.458
I, uh, figured it was about time

08:09.460 --> 08:12.328
I visited my homegirl at home, huh?

08:12.330 --> 08:13.796
Actually, that's a lie.

08:13.798 --> 08:15.495
I... I'm here about <i>Crash'd.</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
I completely understand
why you wouldn't want

08:18.038 --> 08:20.803
your daughter to participate,
but Jenna really wants to do it.

08:20.805 --> 08:22.710
She's just afraid you won't approve.

08:22.876 --> 08:24.306
Approve of what?

08:24.308 --> 08:26.881
Jenna has been chosen
to play Dead St...

08:27.047 --> 08:28.677
Stacey?

08:28.679 --> 08:31.261
Is this about Dead Stacey?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.054
Well...

08:33.220 --> 08:34.931
Oh, my God!

08:35.097 --> 08:36.099
Come with me.
Come... Come here, come here.

08:36.265 --> 08:41.123
I was Dead Stacey, 1995.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.230
Brought down the house!

08:42.395 --> 08:43.424
- Look.
- Oh!

08:43.427 --> 08:45.275
- Oh, my gosh.
- You look amazing.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.944
- So you're okay with this?
- O-okay with it?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.905
I am thrilled!
[Both laugh]

08:51.071 --> 08:53.908
And I was screwed.

08:54.074 --> 08:56.605
Dad, you have to help.

08:56.607 --> 08:58.374
I lied and told Valerie

08:58.376 --> 09:00.542
that you guys
wouldn't let me be Dead Stacey,

09:00.544 --> 09:03.012
and now mom has effed that up
majorly.

09:03.014 --> 09:04.380
Well, if you'd given me a heads-up,

09:04.382 --> 09:05.920
I would've covered for you.

09:06.086 --> 09:08.283
I... Well,
I had, um, a little enhancement.

09:08.285 --> 09:10.285
You can feel 'em,

- Yes.

Dad, you have to do something.

09:16.894 --> 09:18.527
Well, I don't see
what the big deal is.

09:18.529 --> 09:21.296
I mean, Dead Stacey was cool
when I was in high school.

09:21.298 --> 09:23.198
I think you have
conveniently forgotten

09:23.200 --> 09:25.734
that everyone at school already
thinks I tried to kill myself.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.803
But you didn't,

09:27.805 --> 09:31.840
so this is your opportunity
to change the conversation.

09:31.842 --> 09:35.377
I was so over my dad
and his Haiku advice.

09:35.379 --> 09:39.481
Change the conversation?
I had no idea what that meant.

09:39.483 --> 09:41.164
All I knew was that

09:41.330 --> 09:43.986
I was stuck between a rock
and a dead place.

09:43.988 --> 09:47.089
I had been caught in a lie,
and even though I was convinced

09:47.091 --> 09:48.857
Valerie had a touch of asperger's,

09:48.859 --> 09:51.132
I didn't want her to lose her job.

- Hi.

10:41.912 --> 10:44.279
Enough.

10:44.281 --> 10:45.395
Is that your brother?

10:45.561 --> 10:50.191
Yes, I am.
And you are?

10:50.357 --> 10:52.360
Man, please.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.790
I'm sorry.
You should go home.

10:58.228 --> 11:01.096
It was the first time
I listened to my instincts,

11:01.098 --> 11:05.033
and not only did Matty refuse
to introduce me to his brother,

11:05.035 --> 11:07.202
but I got a door slammed in my face.

Every 15 minutes,

11:21.086 --> 11:24.559
someone dies of
an alcohol-related incident.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.937
Today, to represent those deaths,

11:28.103 --> 11:32.066
a grim reaper will tap someone,
and at that time,

11:32.232 --> 11:34.736
those students will become
the living dead

11:34.902 --> 11:37.947
and remain silent
for the rest of the day.

11:38.113 --> 11:44.441

in front of the entire school.

11:55.888 --> 11:57.454
I am the Grim Reaper.

11:57.456 --> 12:00.123
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be
complaining about this to you.

- It's okay.
- You're dead.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.226
While I was clipping
my cat's toenails last night,

12:03.228 --> 12:04.595
I had a catharsis.

12:04.597 --> 12:06.309
I'm glad you're Dead Stacey.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.644
- You are?
- Yeah.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.099
It's like this...

12:09.101 --> 12:11.368
Toenails are dead cells,

12:11.370 --> 12:14.108
and you almost died,
so you deserve this part.

12:14.274 --> 12:16.039
It's like poetic justice.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.775
I just wish I was doing it with you.

12:18.777 --> 12:20.073

- Maybe you can.
- Dead to me!

You're gonna need a dress and a date.

12:26.919 --> 12:28.285

Oh, my God!

- Hey, get back here! Kevin!
- No!

12:42.052 --> 12:43.967
This day is so stupid.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.890
But it's awesome
that Andrew Heder can't talk,

12:46.056 --> 12:47.404
'cause he's, like, kinda stupid,

12:47.406 --> 12:49.477
but he's also kind of a hot ging.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.770
You're dead.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.710
If I don't get to play Dead Stacey,

12:53.712 --> 12:55.483
I am not gonna be a dead extra.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.360
[Chilling voice] Yes, you are.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.738
I am the Grim Reaper.

13:00.904 --> 13:02.365
You can't silence me,

13:02.531 --> 13:05.389
and you can't paint my face
with that [Bleep] either,

13:05.391 --> 13:06.657
it'll make me break out.

13:06.659 --> 13:09.038
Do you know how much

13:09.204 --> 13:11.874
I'll give you

Yeah, cool.

pop the cherry on this.

Okay.

Go ahead and waffle.
It's more intimate that way.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.008
All right, well,

look like a real couple...

Remember, the more blood, the better.

- Yes. I can't be Dead Stacey...

the same event, but better.

I don't know.

15:09.815 --> 15:11.882
I just wanted to apologize.

15:11.884 --> 15:13.150
So you can sleep with me in private,

15:13.152 --> 15:16.720
but you can't talk to me in public?

15:16.722 --> 15:17.921
Figure out what you want, Matty,

15:17.923 --> 15:19.723

your secret.

As I walked to my very public death,

15:22.594 --> 15:24.161
I couldn't help but wonder,

15:24.163 --> 15:25.996
did I just kill
my private relationship

15:25.998 --> 15:27.764
with Matty Mckibben?

put me over a barrel here.

- Dead Stacey lives!

19:05.352 --> 19:07.104
There was a miracle.

19:07.270 --> 19:08.189
[Cheers and applause]

19:08.355 --> 19:10.983
Both: Yeah!

19:13.693 --> 19:15.193
All: Whoo!

19:15.195 --> 19:16.781
Yeah!

19:16.947 --> 19:18.115
[Applause]

19:18.365 --> 19:19.200
Whoo!

19:25.671 --> 19:27.583
Ms. Marks?

19:27.749 --> 19:29.273
I know.
You don't have to say it.

19:29.275 --> 19:30.775
I do.

19:30.777 --> 19:35.279
This was the best drunk driving
awareness day we've ever had.

19:35.281 --> 19:36.881
Oh, boy, um...

19:36.883 --> 19:38.282
Actually, it's called <i>Crash'd.</i>

19:38.284 --> 19:40.585
Mm-hmm.

19:40.587 --> 19:42.019
- Counselors...
- Got it.

19:42.021 --> 19:43.221
- Raising awareness...
- Mm-hmm.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.222
- For students...
- Thank you.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.990
Who, "W" is silent...

19:45.992 --> 19:47.125
I don't care.

19:47.127 --> 19:49.104
Drink.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.161
You were so good.

19:50.163 --> 19:51.816
Almost as good as I was.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.698
Mom, don't cry.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.033
[Sobbing]
I'm not.

19:56.035 --> 19:57.602
But I will if you get blood
on my sweater. [Laughs]

19:57.604 --> 19:59.137
It's cashmere.

19:59.139 --> 20:00.571
Lace, let's let her have the moment.

20:00.573 --> 20:02.159
You were so good.

20:02.325 --> 20:04.495
I was sure playing Dead Stacey

20:04.661 --> 20:06.611
would result in social suicide.

20:06.613 --> 20:09.881
But instead,
my reputation was resurrected.

20:09.883 --> 20:12.049
You were amazing.

20:12.051 --> 20:13.584
And for the first time,

20:13.586 --> 20:16.354
I got the attention
I was looking for.

20:20.010 --> 20:20.992
Next on <i>awkward...</i>

20:20.994 --> 20:22.894
If my party is epically awesome,

20:22.896 --> 20:25.463
maybe Matty will finally
see me as girlfriend material.

20:25.465 --> 20:28.032
When you took that kid out
with your tongue...

20:28.034 --> 20:30.301
- [Laughs]
- I'm wigging out.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.402
I just had partial recall.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.537
I'm not sure I got down with Matty,

20:32.539 --> 20:34.138
because I think
it might have been Jake.

20:34.140 --> 20:36.307
Please confirm or deny,
I'm losing it!
