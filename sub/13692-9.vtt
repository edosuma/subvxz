WEBVTT

00:13.450 --> 00:16.910
ARCHIE:
Now, this ball is gonna be
the biggest day of the year.

00:16.994 --> 00:19.830
Lascelles are bringing
some major investors here

00:19.913 --> 00:22.582
to, er, show them how
they've turned
the place around.

00:22.665 --> 00:24.584
STELLA:
How we've turned it around.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.294
Duncan,
you'll organise the parking.

00:27.377 --> 00:30.546
Golly,
the Americans love the pipes.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.716
Molly, our foreign visitors
are expecting
something between

00:33.799 --> 00:36.635
-the Queen and
the brunette in Braveheart.
-Leave it to me, dear.

00:36.719 --> 00:40.638
Archie and I will
be front of house,
pressing the flesh of course.

00:40.722 --> 00:43.850
Oh,
Lexie, you're in the kitchen.

00:43.933 --> 00:45.726
Surprise, surprise.

00:45.809 --> 00:49.146
Now, the next three
days are going to be
the most seamless, well-oiled

00:49.229 --> 00:52.065
and least accident-prone
in the history of Glenbogle.

00:52.148 --> 00:55.902
If we pull together,
then Lascelles could
get some really good PR

00:55.985 --> 00:58.445
-and we can have a good time.
-Could you list my duties?

00:58.528 --> 01:01.782
Ah, yes,
Father, the Stone ceremony.
You just concentrate on that.

01:01.865 --> 01:05.910
It's what
everyone's coming to see
and, er, it's in your hands.

01:05.993 --> 01:07.995
You can count on me.

01:08.079 --> 01:11.414
Why does that have
a slightly hollow ring to it?

01:52.489 --> 01:55.159
Stone of the MacDonalds?
I thought that
was just a legend.

01:55.243 --> 02:00.455
An ancient symbol of MacDonald
power. It was carried into
battle at Bannockburn.

02:00.538 --> 02:05.292
Midsummer's Day, 1314,
when we sent
the English packing.

02:05.376 --> 02:08.838
Not before the Stone
was cloven into three
by an English axe.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.172
Oh, I say, bad luck.

02:11.255 --> 02:14.718
At Midsummer Ball,
the three
fragments must be joined.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.552
About the ball...

02:19.138 --> 02:20.888
The Glenbogle Fragment.

02:20.971 --> 02:23.599
-Do you mean you've got one?
-The largest, naturally.

02:23.683 --> 02:25.852
Are you sure it's quite safe
to keep it in a cake tin?

02:25.935 --> 02:28.228
My dear Kilwillie, I
guard this with my life.

02:28.311 --> 02:31.397
If lost, my family
name is blackened forever.

02:31.481 --> 02:33.065
Jolly serious.

02:35.026 --> 02:38.612
-As is the guest list I hear.
-Yes.

02:38.695 --> 02:40.822
Captains of industry?

02:40.905 --> 02:43.366
Captains? Generals,
they're sending generals.

02:43.450 --> 02:47.161
My invitation seems
to have gone astray.

02:47.244 --> 02:49.913
Generals of industry
and MacDonalds only,
I'm afraid.

02:49.997 --> 02:52.874
I, Kilwillie, shunned?

02:52.957 --> 02:56.918
My dear Kilwillie,
the bank is
lavishing money on Glenbogle

02:57.002 --> 03:00.297
because it wishes to bask
in our ancient
ties and traditions.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.257
I suggest you
organise some of your own,

03:03.341 --> 03:07.053
should you require
access to the upper echelons.

03:07.136 --> 03:08.763
Good day to you.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.768
It's been 10 years since
the last Midsummer Ball.

03:14.850 --> 03:19.688
And guest what?
Lexie is in the kitchen.
No probe expected.

03:19.772 --> 03:24.442
We've 20 of Lascelles' top
clients and 40 MacDonalds to
feed. I need you here.

03:24.525 --> 03:27.569
Och, and you think he
needs you at the ball?

03:28.945 --> 03:32.282
This is our night.
Mine and Archie's.

03:32.366 --> 03:34.700
You'll do
a wonderful job down here.

03:35.743 --> 03:37.578
True.

03:37.662 --> 03:39.579
I suppose they'll be more
impressed by the
food on the table

03:39.663 --> 03:42.207
than the tart on his arm.

03:42.289 --> 03:45.334
I don't see him
bursting a blood vessel
to get you invited!

03:45.416 --> 03:47.419
You are going because the bank
is paying you.

03:47.502 --> 03:49.838
You don't think he
wants you there, do you?

03:49.922 --> 03:52.340
And he wants you here,
out of his way.

03:52.423 --> 03:54.467
Out of whose way?

03:54.550 --> 03:58.178
You'd better watch her, Arch.
She's trying to get her
claws into you for the ball.

03:58.261 --> 03:59.888
Tell her she's just
a bank manager.

03:59.971 --> 04:01.807
You know that's not
entirely true, Lex.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.599
Oh, don't be hard on her.

04:03.683 --> 04:07.061
She's hoping you'll
waft her out of here
on a white charger.

04:07.144 --> 04:10.689
Tell her she's
just a housekeeper.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.941
I would never say that.

04:13.024 --> 04:15.818
Look,
I'm very flattered to have
cropped up in conversation,

04:15.901 --> 04:20.113
but we have to work together,
remember?
For the bank, for the estate.

04:20.197 --> 04:23.491
-So cease fire?
-Of course, Archie.
Fine by me.

04:25.618 --> 04:26.785
Aye.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.669
Right, well, I can't
stand round here having fun.

04:36.752 --> 04:39.004
My ball gown is
arriving this morning.

04:39.087 --> 04:41.797
Ach, well, make sure you
enjoy your night of glory.

04:41.881 --> 04:45.509
Archie and me'll still be here
when you'll just
be a bad memory.

04:45.592 --> 04:47.136
(DOOR SLAMMING)

05:02.107 --> 05:05.067
Stella, good to see you.

05:05.151 --> 05:07.361
Archie MacDonald,
Laird of Glenbogle.

05:07.445 --> 05:10.113
Toby Winslow, Head of
Corporate Affairs, Lascelles.

05:10.196 --> 05:12.365
You'll know what
we've got riding
on this event of yours?

05:12.449 --> 05:14.409
Yeah, Stella tells me you're
planning a big expansion

05:14.492 --> 05:16.452
into leisure, finance
and management.

05:16.535 --> 05:20.122
Worldwide.
From this little acorn,
a mighty oak will grow.

05:20.205 --> 05:22.999
-The Chairman not with you?
-His flight's delayed.

05:23.082 --> 05:25.418
The old boy usually
swans in to take the plaudits.

05:25.501 --> 05:28.211
It is his train set,
after all.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.965
He's planning to hand the
estate back to you,
Archie, at the ball.

05:32.049 --> 05:33.883
What?

05:33.966 --> 05:36.761
-Well, that's fantastic.
-Now, I did say planning.

05:36.844 --> 05:40.472
His changes of
heart are legendary.
You've been warned.

05:40.555 --> 05:41.806
Stella?

05:47.936 --> 05:51.105
Looks like it's just
you and me now, eh, boss?

05:59.821 --> 06:01.990
Archie. Archie.

06:02.073 --> 06:04.241
It's about
the music for the ball.

06:04.325 --> 06:08.245
-A band from Inverness?
-The Bogle Boys will be
mightily disappointed.

06:08.328 --> 06:10.205
They played at the last ball
10 years ago,

06:10.288 --> 06:12.248
though you probably
won't remember that.

06:12.332 --> 06:14.334
Yes, of course.
The Bogle Boys.

06:14.417 --> 06:18.545
Voted the best band in
the glen four year running.
Even cut a waxing, I believe.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.089
The, er, the Inverness lot
come highly recommended.

06:21.172 --> 06:25.301
Ah, brilliant.
Brilliant, Archie,
but they're not your people.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.135
The Bogle Boys are.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.056
Look, um, Golly, um,

06:31.139 --> 06:35.559
I know the laird has
responsibilities but, erm,
isn't this going a bit far?

06:35.643 --> 06:39.187
There's 39,000 acres
and all the folk
that live on them.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.231
That's how far it goes.

06:45.609 --> 06:48.445
TOBY: Three hundred grand.

06:48.529 --> 06:53.533
Double it with bonuses
and your own empire to build.

06:57.744 --> 06:59.871
It's a huge step.

06:59.955 --> 07:03.249
You won't be wasting your
talents on the Archie
MacDonalds of this world.

07:03.332 --> 07:05.084
Big league, Stella.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.336
Do I get time to
think about it?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.504
Straight after the ball,
you're out of here.

07:09.587 --> 07:13.633
A couple of days
and you're on a plane
to meet your new team.

07:15.759 --> 07:17.052
Toby, I...

07:17.136 --> 07:20.596
Your star is rising.
As I always said it would be.

07:22.598 --> 07:25.268
I mean, I just hope
that nothing goes wrong.

07:25.351 --> 07:28.603
I mean,
I'd hate to be stuck here
for another six months.

07:28.687 --> 07:30.647
Oh, don't worry.

07:30.731 --> 07:34.650
Things'd have to go badly
wrong for me to leave
you at Glenbogle.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.534
How badly exactly?

07:50.705 --> 07:52.290
Boys.

07:52.373 --> 07:56.627
Er, this is Archie
MacDonald from the Big House.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.004
Archie, this is Graeme.

07:59.087 --> 08:02.466
This is his kid brother,
Iain and that's
young Alistair.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.927
Gents, how would you
like to perform again?

08:07.011 --> 08:11.514
We've got the Midsummer Ball
coming up and we'd like
you to play at it.

08:14.059 --> 08:18.312
I'll no more
play for that family
than fly to the moon.

08:21.773 --> 08:25.860
Aye, your father laid him
off like the rest of us,

08:25.944 --> 08:28.862
but Graeme's a proud man,
knocked
the stuffing out of him.

08:28.946 --> 08:32.032
Hasn't had the heart
to play a note since.

08:48.671 --> 08:51.214
Well done, Duncan.

08:51.297 --> 08:55.343
Ah, well, we wanna impress
him, right? This Chairman
Lord whatshisname.

08:55.426 --> 08:57.135
Cranthorne, yes.

09:01.515 --> 09:05.059
You collect him,
Duncan, in the Land Rover.

09:05.142 --> 09:08.645
-What?
-And come back
the scenic route.

09:10.105 --> 09:11.898
He'll like that.

09:14.775 --> 09:19.613
-I haven't come to fight.
-Well, don't go
against nature on my account.

09:19.697 --> 09:22.782
Dinner tonight
for Lord Cranthorne.

09:22.865 --> 09:26.327
Wild salmon with
all the trimmings.
Er, smoked duck to start.

09:26.411 --> 09:28.453
That sounds wonderful.

09:29.162 --> 09:31.123
But?

09:31.206 --> 09:35.418
Lord Cranthorne,
he's a bit of an oddball.
When he's in Scotland...

09:36.294 --> 09:38.004
Go on.

09:38.087 --> 09:41.381
Well,
he makes a big point about,
you know, a simple supper.

09:41.464 --> 09:44.925
Bit of old scrag end,
a few turnips.

09:45.009 --> 09:46.760
What, Crofter's stew?

09:46.844 --> 09:48.637
Yeah, terrible if you ask me.

09:48.721 --> 09:52.432
Well, I'm cooking
for Lord Cranthorne,
my girl, not you.

09:55.059 --> 09:57.728
And what the man wants,

09:59.605 --> 10:01.940
the man gets.

10:02.024 --> 10:03.733
I take it you knew about that.

10:03.816 --> 10:06.193
Oh,
I can't lie to you, Archie,

10:06.277 --> 10:09.404
but people like Graeme
used to be proud to
live in this glen.

10:09.487 --> 10:12.490
Yeah, and they will be again,
once the estate's
back on its feet.

10:12.574 --> 10:15.159
You can't restore a man's
pride by showing him
the bottom line.

10:15.242 --> 10:17.202
That's what
the bank wants to see.

10:17.286 --> 10:20.122
There are better
judges of a man
than the money lenders.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.664
Like Graeme.

10:21.748 --> 10:24.667
Oh, look, Archie you asked me

10:24.751 --> 10:28.462
if I thought that you
could run the estate
and I said yes.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.590
But you never asked me if
I thought you could be
Laird of Glenbogle.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.424
And?

10:33.507 --> 10:36.135
You've got a wee
bit to go yet, son.

10:53.733 --> 10:57.986
Here's Lord Cranthorne now.
His family were at
Bannockburn too, you know.

10:58.070 --> 11:00.447
What?

11:00.530 --> 11:03.574
On the other side obviously,
but it's such a long time ago.

-Of Bannockburn infamy!

could catch up inside.

-You shall not pass!
-ARCHIE: Father!

Come, Cranthorne,
let's grapple hand-to-hand

11:30.973 --> 11:33.557
as our forefathers did
in that bloody field!

11:33.641 --> 11:38.145
Truth is the Cranthorne
family were more into catering
at that particular skirmish.

great tradition.

Comes cheaper from Taiwan.
Who'd know the difference?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.692
Well, Archie's loyal
to the local people.

Narrower margins of course,
but the local
economy benefits.

did you put it all?

it in the back cellar.

-Of course you didn't eat it.

14:23.116 --> 14:26.994
-Maybe I had a wee peek.
-Where did you put it?

14:27.077 --> 14:29.037
-There was nothing in it.
-Duncan...

14:29.121 --> 14:33.165
I swear to you, boss.
It was empty.

14:33.249 --> 14:35.042
ARCHIE:
Yes, yes, it's tragic really.

14:35.126 --> 14:38.461
They were one
of the best bands
in the Highlands in their day.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.255
You can't cling to the past.

14:40.338 --> 14:43.133
ARCHIE: No, no, of course,
but I still feel responsible.

14:43.216 --> 14:49.096
Your responsibilities are to
the bank. 500,000 of them
at the last count.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.514
I take it you're not
going to go soft on us?

14:51.598 --> 14:53.474
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

15:04.984 --> 15:07.194
MOLLY: What's this, Lexie?

15:09.613 --> 15:11.281
Crofter's stew.

15:13.450 --> 15:14.992
Scrag end.

15:16.827 --> 15:21.998
Here we are.
Mutton, neeps and tatties.

15:24.709 --> 15:27.002
A simple Highland supper.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.756
How very authentic.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.967
Thank you, Your Lordship.
Enjoy.

15:35.051 --> 15:36.469
(GROANING)

15:42.974 --> 15:46.310
I don't know what that was.
I doubt its
mother knew either.

15:46.393 --> 15:49.271
I take it you've hired
a real chef for the ball?

15:49.355 --> 15:53.024
-Um, no.
-Well, I suggest you do.

15:53.107 --> 15:54.984
-Well, I can't do that.
-Oh, nonsense.

15:55.068 --> 15:58.529
I've hired and
fired more chefs
than I've had hot dinners.

15:58.612 --> 16:01.281
Almost as many,
come to think of it.

16:02.990 --> 16:06.077
It's no big deal, Archie.
The bank's paying.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.620
It's not the money, it's
Lexie. She'll be mortified.

16:08.703 --> 16:11.581
I admire loyalty, but
Cranthorne has spoken.

16:11.665 --> 16:14.416
If you want the keys back,
do as he says.

16:16.502 --> 16:18.087
If Archie finds
out I've lost it...

16:18.170 --> 16:20.255
Oh, Molly, if I don't produce
it at the ball,

16:20.338 --> 16:22.840
our boy will be deposed as
Head of the Clan.

16:22.924 --> 16:26.134
-The shame.
-Oh, come on, think.

16:26.218 --> 16:29.513
I'm sure I put
it back in the tin
when that ass Kilwillie went.

16:29.596 --> 16:32.557
Oh, don't tell me that you two
have been falling out again.

16:32.640 --> 16:37.478
He was begging me for an
invitation to the ball. I told
him it was rather exclusive.

16:37.562 --> 16:40.605
-And then he left?
-No, damn it, I left!

16:41.940 --> 16:43.942
I left.

16:44.024 --> 16:48.654
I left Kilwillie alone
with the Glenbogle Fragment.
Molly, you're a genius.

16:48.737 --> 16:50.488
But how can we
get him to confess?

16:50.572 --> 16:54.701
Leave it to me,
I'll make him squeal.
We'll be Mutt and Jeff.

16:54.784 --> 16:57.244
-Good cop, bad cop to you.
-Splendid, woman!

16:57.327 --> 16:59.997
We'll collar
the rotter tomorrow. Yes.

17:01.665 --> 17:05.126
-Hector? Molly?
-Now squeal, Kilwillie,
or I'll put the arm on.

17:05.209 --> 17:07.377
We're only here to
help you, old man.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.505
What on earth's
the matter with you both?

17:10.589 --> 17:12.840
Nice place you've
got here, Kilwillie.

17:12.924 --> 17:14.967
Yes.
Shame if it was smashed up.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.303
-Now steady on.
-Fess up, Kilwillie.

17:17.386 --> 17:19.972
Unless you'd rather back
the blab with the pigs.

17:20.054 --> 17:24.767
-Is this some
sort of Esperanto?
-What have you done with it?

17:24.851 --> 17:28.228
Oh, all right, I did take it.
But Hector was
damnably rude to me!

17:28.311 --> 17:30.814
Oh, save it for
the social worker.

17:30.898 --> 17:34.066
Hector, if you were rude,
you must say sorry.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.695
-(MUMBLING) Sorry.
-Speak up, dear.

17:37.778 --> 17:41.364
-Sorry! And I will use my
considerable influence...
-Hector.

17:41.448 --> 17:45.492
-I'll get you an invitation.
-Well, then...

17:45.576 --> 17:50.662
To Glenbogle, friends,
where the ancient Fragment
rests in complete security.

17:50.747 --> 17:55.043
-I sincerely hope so.
-It's better than
a Dundee cake tin, Hector.

17:57.085 --> 17:58.962
Thought it went
well last night.

17:59.046 --> 18:00.881
Lord Cranthorne's right,

18:00.964 --> 18:04.842
it's nice to have something
authentic. You know, for
a wee change.

18:04.926 --> 18:07.678
It was
certainly a change, Lex.

18:07.762 --> 18:09.804
So have you come
to help me dry up?

18:09.888 --> 18:14.934
Er, no, no.
It's about the ball actually.
I've decided to hire a chef.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.271
-You said...
-I know what I said.

18:20.355 --> 18:22.565
-...I was the only
one you could trust.
-And I meant it.

18:22.649 --> 18:25.151
-"I depend on you, Lexie."
-I do, I do.

18:25.235 --> 18:29.238
Oh, so now you just
drop me like a dirty rag?

18:29.321 --> 18:32.323
I did it so you can
come to the ball, Lex.

18:34.283 --> 18:37.870
Oh, Arch.
You're such a sweet man.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.583
(DOOR OPENING)

18:47.586 --> 18:49.505
-Come in!
-Morning!

18:54.259 --> 18:55.802
Now...

18:55.884 --> 19:00.180
"Drama schools.
Draught proofing..."
Ah! Dress hire.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.598
Should I be curious?

19:02.682 --> 19:07.144
-I shall go to the ball.
-You're going to a lot
of trouble for nothing.

19:07.228 --> 19:10.981
So are you. Going as
a packet of Wine Gums?

19:11.064 --> 19:15.150
I'm going as Archie's partner.
Who's cooking?

19:15.234 --> 19:18.445
Er, ask your "partner".
He fixed it for me.

19:31.832 --> 19:34.250
Penny for them.

19:34.333 --> 19:38.003
That is a derisory offer,
Stella Moon,
and you know it.

19:40.630 --> 19:45.092
I gather Lexie isn't
cooking for the ball.
Any special reason?

19:45.176 --> 19:49.346
Er, yes. Cranthorne took
against her Crofter's stew.

19:49.430 --> 19:52.348
But I thought it best
not to mention that.

19:52.432 --> 19:55.518
Ah, your management
skills are improving.

20:00.314 --> 20:02.565
-Problem?
-Finding a chef.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.702
Jeff Ramsden. Any good?

20:16.785 --> 20:21.122
Yeah. And at a loose
end as far as I know.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.585
(PHONE DIALLING)

20:26.668 --> 20:28.879
I saw it in a cinema film.

20:28.962 --> 20:33.132
A burglar placed his swag
in a lavatory cistern
for later collection.

20:33.216 --> 20:34.842
Get on with it!

20:34.926 --> 20:40.096
Any more of that
and you can fish
the bally thing out yourself.

20:40.180 --> 20:44.558
It's been removed.
The Fragment isn't there.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.393
-What?
-Oh, Kilwillie.

20:46.477 --> 20:49.688
I swear to you,
I put it there
myself yesterday morning.

20:49.771 --> 20:51.481
But, well, now it's gone.

20:51.564 --> 20:52.899
(GROANING)

21:01.864 --> 21:05.993
I'm guessing it's some years
since a MacDonald last
knocked on your door.

21:06.077 --> 21:07.495
It's a few.

21:13.874 --> 21:18.170
We were loggers.
Myself,
brother Iain, young Alistair.

21:19.754 --> 21:24.425
Thirty years we
tended these forests.

21:24.509 --> 21:29.513
Ten years ago your father laid
us off. Chose to tell us at
the Midsummer Ball.

21:29.596 --> 21:31.640
Mmm, his timing isn't perfect.

21:31.723 --> 21:36.394
We played whilst
the nobs danced and
cavorted before us.

21:36.477 --> 21:42.858
Dancing this fine estate into
oblivion with great grins
on their faces.

21:42.941 --> 21:47.278
Look,
Graeme, I can't help the past
but I'm running it now.

21:47.361 --> 21:49.530
The estate's back on its feet.

21:49.613 --> 21:54.492
It staggers a bit from time
to time, but it's working. And
I want you to feel part of it.

21:54.576 --> 21:58.078
-It's a fine sentiment.
-No, no,
it's more than that, Graeme.

21:58.162 --> 22:02.039
Glenbogle's back
and it wants to hear
its own music again.

22:25.226 --> 22:28.187
Haven't touched
this in 10 years, mind.

22:30.606 --> 22:32.565
Do you want to play?

22:33.900 --> 22:35.818
We'll give it a go.

22:44.617 --> 22:47.912
Before you start, I'm going.
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

22:47.995 --> 22:52.123
Can we talk normally for once?

22:52.207 --> 22:57.336
Look, I know you're
fond of Archie and he's...
Well, he's lucky to have you.

22:57.419 --> 23:01.632
What, as his housekeeper, no
doubt? Whereas you've got
the great business mind.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.801
You say all the right things,
hang about with
all the right people.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.303
You think Archie's
just some tasty lad
from down the street?

23:08.386 --> 23:12.432
He's the Laird of Glenbogle.
How could you
possibly live up to that?

23:12.516 --> 23:15.226
-I love him.
-That's not hard.

23:15.309 --> 23:17.311
The rest is.

23:17.394 --> 23:22.607
Keep what you've got
with Archie right now.
His affection and respect.

23:22.690 --> 23:25.485
But don't dream
of anything more.

23:25.568 --> 23:28.654
Well, he fixed it for
me to go to the ball.

23:28.737 --> 23:32.198
Cranthorne didn't
like your cooking, Lexie.

23:32.281 --> 23:36.119
Archie was just trying to
spare your feelings,
that's all.

23:39.121 --> 23:41.331
(CAR APPROACHING)

23:41.414 --> 23:43.333
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

23:43.416 --> 23:45.376
Are you ready for the off?

23:45.459 --> 23:47.586
I... I'm... I'm not gonna go.

23:47.670 --> 23:50.505
-What's she
been saying to you?
-Nothing.

23:50.588 --> 23:55.717
That you're just some little
skivvy and she's,
what, God's gift to banking?

23:55.801 --> 23:58.804
Well,
I thought you fancied her.

23:58.887 --> 24:00.639
I did.

24:00.722 --> 24:03.766
Oh, come on, Lex.
You're worth 10 of her.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.479
Do you think I'm gonna
make a fool of myself?

24:09.563 --> 24:11.857
Dressed like that you will.

24:23.533 --> 24:25.160
(CLEARING THROAT)

24:27.286 --> 24:29.621
I feel like a Christmas tree.

24:31.081 --> 24:33.207
Well, say something.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.459
(MUMBLING)

24:34.542 --> 24:36.169
What, really?

24:37.586 --> 24:40.255
Wow.

24:40.338 --> 24:44.633
Well, can you have a look
at the price tag for me?
I can't get at it.

24:47.011 --> 24:49.096
-Oh.
-What?

24:50.722 --> 24:53.850
Ach, I wanted to hire
the dress, not buy the shop.

24:55.477 --> 24:58.103
Oh,
well, nice while it lasted.

25:19.288 --> 25:21.080
Don't be such a fool, girl.

25:24.292 --> 25:27.252
-I can't take that.
-Yes, you can.

25:27.336 --> 25:30.005
-Oh, Duncan, that's all...
-Take it.

25:33.508 --> 25:37.011
Thanks, Dunc. I owe you one.

25:41.306 --> 25:45.142
Duncan!
Have you been messing about
with the thunderbox?

25:45.226 --> 25:50.230
Oh, the... I fixed it like you
said, boss. Some loon had put
a rock in the cistern.

25:50.313 --> 25:52.148
-What do you mean, loon?
-Rock?

25:52.232 --> 25:55.026
And where would
the rock be now, boy?

25:57.027 --> 25:59.738
Well, shouldn't we come back
in the morning when it's open?

25:59.822 --> 26:03.199
The future of Glenbogle is
at stake. We have to get
through this wire now!

26:03.282 --> 26:05.993
But, Hector, look at me.
I can't go in
there in these clothes.

26:06.077 --> 26:09.121
I don't think
there's a dress code.

26:09.204 --> 26:12.499
-You boys go in,
I'll keep obbo.
-I'll help Molly.

26:12.582 --> 26:15.835
Where's your sense of
moral fortitude, man?
What is the matter with you?

26:15.918 --> 26:17.878
Get through the hole!

26:21.172 --> 26:23.216
HECTOR: Go on.
KILWILLE: Really!

26:24.717 --> 26:27.219
(PLAYING OFF-KEY)

26:29.138 --> 26:31.639
Well,
you know what they say about
a bad rehearsal.

26:31.722 --> 26:35.935
You managed to find
the musical equivalent
of a Crofter's stew.

26:36.018 --> 26:38.145
-What, authentic?
-Unpalatable.

26:38.228 --> 26:39.771
They haven't got loose yet.

26:39.855 --> 26:42.399
Oh, yes, they have.
I don't know where from.

26:42.482 --> 26:45.067
Wherever it is,
send them back and
hire some musicians.

26:45.151 --> 26:47.695
Please,
just give them a chance, huh?
Look, I owe these guys.

26:47.778 --> 26:50.155
If we're talking of
what you owe, Mr MacDonald,

26:50.238 --> 26:54.951
I think my bank has precedence
over this bunch of
tuneless amateurs.

26:55.034 --> 26:58.454
-Oh, fellas, please!
-We'll not
embarrass you further.

26:58.537 --> 27:00.956
You collect me
in a bone shaker
driven by a madman,

27:01.039 --> 27:03.374
to be greeted by your
father spoiling for a fight,

27:03.458 --> 27:07.544
you serve a bowl of
gristle swimming in fat
and now you have no musicians.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.338
Jeff Ramsden. Archie. Chef.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.424
Oh, am I glad to see you.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.884
-What's he doing here?
-Oh, this is Lord Cranthorne.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.927
-I know who he is.
-Have we met?

27:17.011 --> 27:18.888
Yeah, just the once.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.681
He's fired more chefs
than he's had hot dinners.
Tell you that?

27:21.765 --> 27:24.893
-Proud of it, His Lordship.
-Yeah, all right. I'm
sure we can sort this out.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.978
Yeah. Only one thing
you've got to sort out.
Who's cooking tomorrow.

27:28.061 --> 27:29.772
-Jeff, please.
-I'm sorry, mate.

27:29.855 --> 27:33.065
I'm not hanging around
to get the push again.
Not from that creep.

27:33.149 --> 27:36.360
Now you have no chef either.
Cancel the ball.

27:42.949 --> 27:46.035
Oh, Hector, I'm so tired.
Can't we just call it a day?

27:46.118 --> 27:49.121
We'll call it no such thing.
I will leave no
stone unturned.

27:49.205 --> 27:52.415
-DUNCAN: Got it!
-Don't interrupt. No stone...

27:54.459 --> 27:55.584
Got it!

27:55.667 --> 27:57.836
-Bravo!
-Well done!

28:02.840 --> 28:05.093
Like so many of
your plans, Hector,

28:05.176 --> 28:08.970
this one was a corker
until the moment of
catastrophic failure!

28:09.054 --> 28:11.014
Oh, shut up!

28:13.474 --> 28:16.727
I won't have
Lascelles associated with
a catastrophe like you.

28:16.811 --> 28:18.771
Your guests will
already be on their way.

28:18.854 --> 28:20.772
By tomorrow morning,
everything'll be ironed out.

28:20.855 --> 28:23.024
It'll all be running
like clockwork.

28:23.108 --> 28:26.485
-If this is a disaster...
-There won't be any more
disasters, I promise you.

28:40.747 --> 28:42.707
Merely assisting in
certain inquiries.

28:42.791 --> 28:47.086
We picked up these
four at the municipal dump
sorting through the rubbish.

28:47.169 --> 28:49.629
Claimed some
connection with you.

28:49.712 --> 28:52.215
Yes, Officer, they're mine.

28:53.883 --> 28:57.344
Try and keep your nose clean,
Lord Cranthorne, hmm?

29:08.228 --> 29:14.400
ARCHIE: Lord Cranthorne seems
upset for some reason.
I can't think why.

29:14.483 --> 29:17.611
The thing is tomorrow is
one of the most
important days of the year

29:17.695 --> 29:20.739
and everything is
hanging in rags.

29:20.822 --> 29:23.158
Is there,
um, anything we can do?

29:23.241 --> 29:26.785
Well,
I wonder, just for tomorrow,

29:26.869 --> 29:31.330
if you could all try
to pass yourselves off
as normal human beings.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.883
It's not your fault,
you know.

29:43.966 --> 29:46.510
No, no.
But it's my responsibility.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.889
I used to think
Glenbogle was my future,
you know.

29:50.972 --> 29:53.475
-It still is.
-No, no.

29:53.558 --> 29:58.187
You see,
I am Glenbogle's future.
There's a big difference.

29:58.270 --> 30:02.231
35,000 acres and all
the people on them.

30:02.315 --> 30:06.652
I am their future
and I can't even
organise a dance.

30:06.736 --> 30:08.153
It's just a setback.

30:08.236 --> 30:09.863
Hmm!

30:09.946 --> 30:13.491
The Bogle Boys, they
didn't believe in me either.

30:13.574 --> 30:15.284
I believe in you.

30:16.869 --> 30:20.121
But if things do go wrong,
and I have to stay,

30:21.706 --> 30:24.167
would that be
the worst thing in the world?

30:24.250 --> 30:28.837
No, of course not.
The way things are going,
I wouldn't pack just yet.

30:35.927 --> 30:37.260
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

30:37.344 --> 30:38.678
Come in.

30:40.514 --> 30:42.849
Hi, Arch. What's wrong?

30:44.558 --> 30:49.021
-What, do you not like it?
-No, it's beautiful.

30:49.105 --> 30:52.607
-Then why the long face?
-My new chef's done a bunk.

30:55.359 --> 30:58.487
-You cannot be serious.
-Well, who else can I ask?

30:58.570 --> 31:03.699
-Good old Lexie.
Resident doormat.
-Is that how you feel?

31:03.783 --> 31:08.495
Well, one minute I'm going to
the ball, the next minute I'm
stuck in the kitchen.

31:08.578 --> 31:11.957
Stella's right,
I'm just the housekeeper.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.166
You know I don't
think of you like that.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.919
-You don't think of me at all.
-I do.

31:18.379 --> 31:22.298
I do, Lexie. A lot.

31:22.382 --> 31:25.509
Well, you've got a funny way
of showing it,
Archie MacDonald.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.511
Just go now, please.

31:49.738 --> 31:53.366
The Glenbogle Fragment.
Retrieved from Bannockburn.

31:53.450 --> 31:57.995
Tonight we rejoin the Stone
which
the English broke asunder.

31:58.078 --> 31:59.621
(TIN CLATTERING)

31:59.705 --> 32:02.915
The ball is now
an assured success.

32:25.350 --> 32:27.144
(CHUCKLING)

32:27.227 --> 32:30.939
Nothing changes, Golly.
You saw how we were treated.

32:31.023 --> 32:33.816
-Not by Archie.
-His heart's in
the right place, man,

32:33.900 --> 32:37.486
but Glenbogle is gone.
It'll never rise again.

32:37.569 --> 32:40.614
Never rise again.
Our ancestors
thought that about the sun.

32:40.697 --> 32:44.408
So in the winter,
they built fires,
made music, danced.

32:44.492 --> 32:47.328
So that
the pounding of their feet
would awaken the earth.

32:47.411 --> 32:50.747
They didn't sit around all day
in a pub waiting for
someone else to do it.

32:50.830 --> 32:52.874
Young Archie's put his neck on
the block for you..

32:52.957 --> 32:56.001
So it's time
you stood up and were counted.

33:01.839 --> 33:03.841
What's this?

33:03.925 --> 33:06.844
Well, you didn't honestly
think you could manage
without me, did you?

33:06.928 --> 33:08.970
You know that I can't.

33:09.054 --> 33:13.808
Well, it's not your
fault the chef walked out.
So, Lexie to the rescue.

33:15.893 --> 33:19.729
Now away and do
some lairdy duties
and let me to my kitchen.

33:19.813 --> 33:22.732
-Well, I can help.
-I can manage.

33:22.816 --> 33:26.026
I'd like to if that's okay.

33:26.110 --> 33:28.821
Go. Start on the potatoes.

33:33.908 --> 33:38.286
-I don't deserve you,
you know that?
-What's to deserve?

33:38.370 --> 33:40.706
Where would I be without you?

33:42.374 --> 33:45.459
Probably doing
the meat as well as the veg.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.348
Duncan, just the man.

34:02.432 --> 34:04.434
I hate to put this on you,

34:04.517 --> 34:09.271
but our guests
want to see something
of the estate before the ball.

34:09.353 --> 34:10.813
No problem.

34:10.897 --> 34:14.400
Meet the cars at the gate.
You can walk from there.

34:14.483 --> 34:17.360
-Walk?
-Take them on one of
your nature trails.

34:17.445 --> 34:21.572
Show them...
Oh, you know so much
more about it than I do.

34:22.322 --> 34:25.451
Use your imagination.

34:36.668 --> 34:41.380
Now you really should be
somewhere else. Go on,
your guests are arriving.

34:45.509 --> 34:48.554
It's amazing,
all this time and
effort just for one night.

34:48.637 --> 34:53.141
Arch, it's what you were
born to do. Same as this is
what I was born to do.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.391
Each to their own, eh?

34:55.476 --> 34:57.603
I wish you were
gonna be there, Lex.

34:57.686 --> 35:01.606
I'll be here where
you need me. Now go.

35:01.689 --> 35:05.735
Stella'll be
wondering where you are
and I have work to do.

35:07.069 --> 35:08.320
(SIGHING)

35:08.403 --> 35:10.322
Welcome to Glenbogle!

35:10.405 --> 35:15.493
And I'm pleased to offer,
as requested, a short walking
tour of the estate.

35:15.576 --> 35:18.120
The theme of this
evening's tour will be,

35:18.204 --> 35:21.623
"A Day In The Life
Of A Head Ranger."

35:23.917 --> 35:26.126
(GUESTS GRUMBLING)

35:33.174 --> 35:37.177
Ah, Hamish with
the Auchterglen Fragment.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.095
It's a proud day
to be a MacDonald.

35:39.179 --> 35:42.516
And Robert with
the Culpokie Fragment.
All are safely gathered in.

35:42.599 --> 35:46.976
'Tis as well. We none of
us want our families
blackened for all eternity.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.771
-Quite so.
-Absolutely.

35:49.854 --> 35:51.731
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

35:58.403 --> 36:01.239
-Ah, Lord Cranthorne.
-Mmm?

36:01.322 --> 36:04.033
I've strict instructions,
no wallflowers.

36:04.116 --> 36:07.911
So, this is Melissa,
your buddy for the evening.

36:07.995 --> 36:10.247
Wonderful idea,
this buddy system.

36:10.329 --> 36:13.708
Now, you two get to know
each other. I've plenty more
matches to make.

36:13.791 --> 36:15.292
Come along.

36:41.314 --> 36:43.566
(PLAYING OFF-KEY)

36:49.237 --> 36:51.072
Get that woman away from me.

36:51.156 --> 36:54.825
What, you mean you
didn't hit it off?
Oh, dear, never mind.

36:54.908 --> 36:58.787
There's a nice young man
over here who's simply dying
to be your buddy.

36:58.871 --> 37:01.497
Mother, I don't think
Lord Cranthorne needs a buddy.

37:01.581 --> 37:03.875
And Lexie would like some help
in the kitchen, please.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.835
Oh, excuse me.

37:05.918 --> 37:08.170
-All going very well.
-Oh, do you think so?

37:08.253 --> 37:12.424
No, a disaster, as predicted.
Not that it matters,
there are very few guests.

37:12.507 --> 37:15.301
Oh, don't worry,
the others'll be
along soon, I'm sure.

37:15.384 --> 37:20.096
How do you maintain
your relentless
optimism in the face of doom?

37:20.180 --> 37:23.016
-Practise.
-Oh.

37:23.099 --> 37:27.144
I was only trying to help.
I thought this buddy
thing was all the rage.

37:27.227 --> 37:29.688
-And who told you that?
-Stella.

37:36.110 --> 37:38.070
And so here we are.

37:39.613 --> 37:42.366
I can't accept gratuities,
gentlemen.

37:48.412 --> 37:51.539
What have you done to them,
you great white loaf?

37:51.623 --> 37:53.583
DUNCAN: Just following orders.

37:53.667 --> 37:57.127
(SCOFFING) And I
bet you I know whose.

37:59.672 --> 38:02.006
Oh, I say, old man,
do you have bad news?

38:02.090 --> 38:05.968
Of the very worst kind.
The Fragment has
vanished again.

38:06.052 --> 38:08.845
To lose the Fragment once,
Hector, is unfortunate.
To lose it...

38:08.929 --> 38:10.681
Spare me the claptrap.

38:10.764 --> 38:13.557
-I locked it in
the sideboard this morning.
-Are you certain?

38:13.641 --> 38:16.185
Cranthorne watched me.
Ask him if you
don't believe me.

38:16.268 --> 38:20.313
Cranthorne?
Whose forebears were defeated
at Bannockburn by your own

38:20.397 --> 38:23.108
-which we
celebrate this very night?
-The same.

38:23.191 --> 38:27.528
Who had the means, the
motive and the opportunity to
steal the Glenbogle Fragment?

38:27.611 --> 38:30.863
That Cranthorne?

38:30.947 --> 38:33.533
ARCHIE:
...the estate and the bank
working hand in glove.

38:33.616 --> 38:38.745
Villain!
I denounce you as
a thief and a blackguard!

38:38.829 --> 38:42.499
This man has stolen
the Glenbogle Fragment!

38:42.582 --> 38:46.752
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
Please, please, I'm
sure we can sort this out.

38:46.836 --> 38:52.382
Er, on with the ball.
There's nothing to see here.
Music. Dancing.

38:57.261 --> 39:02.223
I'd say we'd got to
the end of the road,
wouldn't you?

39:02.307 --> 39:04.892
You gave us just enough rope
to hang ourselves, didn't you?

39:04.976 --> 39:08.145
-And Archie along with us.
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:08.228 --> 39:12.399
-Oh, Hector's greeting?
The Crofter's stew?
-Well, you cooked it.

39:12.482 --> 39:15.443
I... The disappearing chef?
And Duncan's walking tours?

39:15.526 --> 39:17.486
-Well, you know Duncan.
-Yeah, and so do you.

39:17.570 --> 39:21.281
Which leads me to
the buddy system.

39:21.364 --> 39:24.742
-Lexie,
I didn't mean any harm.
-Yeah, right.

39:26.035 --> 39:30.872
I just wanted more time here.
With Archie.

39:30.955 --> 39:34.709
I never thought
I'd fall for anyone again,
after Graham.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.588
And then being here, I have.

39:41.923 --> 39:45.051
Lexie,
please don't hate me for it.

39:45.134 --> 39:48.304
For loving Archie? How can I?

39:50.388 --> 39:54.392
Oh, God,
bring back the old Stella,

39:54.476 --> 39:58.103
the hard-nosed bitch
I could have
a good scrap with.

40:00.688 --> 40:02.940
You're going to tell him?

40:03.024 --> 40:05.568
I think that
should come from you.

40:19.537 --> 40:22.582
Golly,
do you think the Bogle Boys
could manage another dirge?

40:22.666 --> 40:25.292
It's not
entirely inappropriate
under the circumstances.

40:25.376 --> 40:27.962
I'm sorry, boss.

40:28.045 --> 40:31.631
Okay. Right.
Ah, they're not for you.

40:31.714 --> 40:34.133
Molly, take these to
the penguins, please.

40:34.217 --> 40:36.969
Hector, go and
apologise to Lord Cranthorne.

40:37.052 --> 40:39.221
Grovel, beg, crawl, I
don't care what you do

40:39.304 --> 40:41.765
but make sure he's here
in the next five minutes.

40:41.848 --> 40:46.018
Golly, go and tell the Bogle
Boys if their fingers aren't
loose in the next six minutes,

40:46.102 --> 40:48.270
I'm gonna pull
them off one by one.

40:48.354 --> 40:51.064
-Duncan, kitchen.
-Lex, I know you're
trying to help, but...

40:51.147 --> 40:55.109
You go and find Stella.
She's got
something to tell you.

41:06.994 --> 41:08.412
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

41:10.789 --> 41:12.748
You wanted something?

41:14.750 --> 41:18.504
The last few days have
been a bit of a shambles.

41:18.586 --> 41:22.882
Duncan,
Hector, the Crofter's stew.

41:22.966 --> 41:25.301
Yes, I don't know
what got into them.

41:25.384 --> 41:27.553
It was me.

41:27.636 --> 41:30.888
I told Duncan to
use the Land Rover.

41:30.972 --> 41:34.392
I told Lexie that Cranthorne
likes plain cooking.

41:36.477 --> 41:37.686
Ah.

41:38.854 --> 41:41.315
I wanted to stay
here because...

41:44.108 --> 41:47.486
I think I've fallen in
love with you, Archie.

41:49.237 --> 41:50.822
Look, Stella, I'm...

41:50.905 --> 41:54.284
I thought you
might feel the same
if we had more time.

41:56.076 --> 42:00.705
And now I've made
a real fool of myself.
Not like me, eh?

42:00.788 --> 42:03.166
You're fond of me, aren't you?

42:04.542 --> 42:07.919
Actually, I think there
might be someone else.

42:11.048 --> 42:12.382
Lexie.

42:15.551 --> 42:17.720
She found me out tonight.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.262
She didn't say anything.

42:19.346 --> 42:23.016
She just put it right for you.
Like she always has.

42:24.850 --> 42:28.604
Like she always will,
if you let her.

42:42.407 --> 42:46.702
The last throw of the dice.
Poor Hector.

43:00.755 --> 43:05.260
Come with me.
I want you there when it
all fits together at last.

43:19.729 --> 43:22.274
MAN: Present the Stone!

43:34.409 --> 43:39.705
Hector MacDonald,
a dark duty befalls me,

43:39.788 --> 43:43.332
for a part of
the Stone that was broken
has been lost.

43:43.416 --> 43:46.460
-Just mislaid.
-Oh, Archie.

43:46.544 --> 43:48.296
(HECTOR CHUCKLING)

43:48.379 --> 43:51.715
Fellow MacDonalds,
honoured guests,

43:51.798 --> 43:57.052
we've had a Sassenach in
our midst. A Sassenach we
thrashed at Bannockburn.

43:57.136 --> 44:02.682
Lord Cranthorne,
you have
witnessed us at our worst.

44:02.765 --> 44:06.102
I'm so glad you were able to
remain long enough
to see us at our best.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.270
Our unity.

44:08.353 --> 44:12.773
Our pride in who we are and
what we've achieved and our
confidence in the future.

44:15.943 --> 44:20.864
Lord Cranthorne,
would you be so kind...

44:26.201 --> 44:28.162
I'd be honoured, sir.

44:34.083 --> 44:38.921
What was broken
is now restored,
like this great estate.

44:39.004 --> 44:41.548
There's a spirit in Glenbogle

44:41.632 --> 44:45.009
and I share Hector's
faith in the future.

44:46.469 --> 44:50.180
Archie, Laird,

44:50.263 --> 44:53.642
Glenbogle is
restored to you again.

44:58.187 --> 45:00.647
GRAEME:
Now that's worth a tune.

45:01.898 --> 45:03.942
(PLAYING MELODIOUSLY)

45:13.991 --> 45:17.119
I've just
scheduled five meetings.
They're all panting to invest.

45:17.203 --> 45:19.496
They seem to think
this is a sort
of themed evening,

45:19.579 --> 45:23.708
all is chaos, then Lascelles
sweep in, bringing
success and happiness.

45:23.792 --> 45:25.751
One travels in hope.

45:30.089 --> 45:33.758
Toby seems to think you
can manage without me.

45:33.841 --> 45:35.927
He's offered me South America.

45:36.010 --> 45:38.679
What, all of it?

45:38.762 --> 45:42.515
If it was, it would
come in a very poor second.

45:42.598 --> 45:45.309
You'll be missed.

45:45.393 --> 45:50.564
I'll always carry this
place in my heart, Archie.
Wherever I am.

45:57.695 --> 45:59.947
-Goodbye, Archie.
-Goodbye.

46:39.521 --> 46:41.857
Well,
that went okay, didn't it?

46:41.940 --> 46:44.859
Mmm, better than that.
You are a wonder.

46:44.942 --> 46:49.362
Oh, get away.
But you'll never get
another housekeeper like me.

46:51.948 --> 46:54.283
You know...

46:54.366 --> 47:00.164
all this time
there's been something
working away at me inside.

47:00.246 --> 47:04.500
These last few days I
realised what it is.

47:06.044 --> 47:08.587
Crofter's stew probably.

47:08.670 --> 47:11.757
Lexie, I love you.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.799
I think I always have.

47:17.178 --> 47:22.349
This isn't a fairy tale, Arch.
We don't get a happy ending.

47:25.184 --> 47:27.061
We do if we love each other.

47:27.144 --> 47:30.688
But you're the laird.
I'm still the housekeeper.

47:33.358 --> 47:37.069
I want you to be my wife.

47:37.152 --> 47:42.490
I couldn't live up to that.
I'd let you down,
I couldn't bear that.

47:42.573 --> 47:45.618
You wouldn't let me down.
You never let me down.

47:45.701 --> 47:48.495
Oh, that's different.

47:48.578 --> 47:52.707
This is what I know.
This is where I belong.

47:52.791 --> 47:55.000
You belong with me.

47:57.586 --> 48:01.214
Don't. I'm not right for you.

48:03.967 --> 48:09.304
There are all kinds of excuses
for letting happiness slip
through your fingers.

48:09.388 --> 48:13.599
Let's not do that.
Let's take our chance.

48:19.187 --> 48:21.147
Look at this place.

48:24.067 --> 48:27.736
If it's cleared for breakfast,
it'll be a miracle.

49:02.181 --> 49:04.267
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

49:21.615 --> 49:23.450
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

49:25.075 --> 49:26.785
Take a chance?

49:40.756 --> 49:42.673
I don't have a ring.

49:50.597 --> 49:52.015
No excuses.
