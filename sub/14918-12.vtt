WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:04.034
A lemon battery?

00:04.034 --> 00:05.203
When you put your tongue
on the wire,

00:05.428 --> 00:07.445
You get zapped like a taser.
Wow.

00:07.445 --> 00:10.444
-He begged me to do it.
-Yeah. It was awesome!

00:10.444 --> 00:12.040
(laughs)
(sarah) paige, I'm throwing in

00:12.040 --> 00:13.863
A couple of your favorite
applesauce cookies.

00:13.863 --> 00:15.576
Make sure you test
your blood sugar level

00:15.576 --> 00:19.037
Before you have them, okay?
Here, catch. Mom, duck.
Ooh.

00:19.237 --> 00:23.082
Ew. Tuna.
Since when did you not like tuna?

00:23.082 --> 00:24.719
Since I read it's got mercury.

00:24.919 --> 00:28.948
-But if you want me to eat poison...
-Yep, that's why I made tuna, paige,

00:28.948 --> 00:31.498
-So that I could poison you.
-Whatever. I'll--I'll trade it.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.334
Did you show grama
your science project?

00:34.334 --> 00:37.016
Yes, she did.
Very impressive.

00:37.016 --> 00:37.857
Mm-hmm.
Not really.

00:38.161 --> 00:40.095
Henry's making
an earthquake simulator.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.396
He says he's doing it himself,
but his dad's an architect,

00:43.495 --> 00:45.665
So you know
he's doing it for him.

00:46.099 --> 00:47.600
You know,
I have this afternoon free.

00:47.634 --> 00:50.443
-Maybe we could finish yours together.
-I can do it myself.

00:50.443 --> 00:53.306
Sarah, why don't you just
let her go to school?
Why don't we call the uncles?

00:53.306 --> 00:55.943
I mean, if henry's gonna use
his family resources,

00:55.943 --> 00:57.739
Why don't we take
full advantage of ours?

00:57.739 --> 01:01.416
If I say yes, will you leave me
alone, even at the fair?

01:02.487 --> 01:03.688
Yes. I'll pretend
we've never met.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.007
(horn honks)
hey, we're on.

01:05.007 --> 01:07.355
Bye, grandma.
Bye, sugar pie. See ya.

01:07.355 --> 01:09.469
(cooper) bye, grandma. Bye.
Bye, coop.

01:09.469 --> 01:10.545
(sarah) I love you!

01:10.545 --> 01:12.511
(door opens)

01:12.511 --> 01:15.361
Okay, you won't believe
what happened.

01:15.361 --> 01:17.740
(door closes)
who is that child?
I don't recognize her.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.340
She's been so obstinate lately,
downright obnoxious.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.909
Preteens--they're hard.
Anyway, last--

01:22.909 --> 01:24.468
No, they call them "tweens"
now, mom.

01:24.468 --> 01:27.430
Tweens. And if I'm not the most
neglectful mother in the world,

01:27.430 --> 01:29.276
I'm the most stifling.

01:29.276 --> 01:31.281
Mothers are never right.
So, sarah, listen.

01:31.281 --> 01:33.629
I need your advice.
-Do you think this is cosmic payback

01:33.629 --> 01:37.588
-For me and kitty, for when we were--
-Sarah, for god sake, will you shut up?

01:38.662 --> 01:40.670
Sin called.

01:40.670 --> 01:44.742
-Yeah. He left two messages this morning.
-You didn't call him back, did you?

01:44.742 --> 01:45.683
Why, do you think I should?

01:45.683 --> 01:48.833
No. Mom, he dropped off the face
of the earth for six weeks

01:48.833 --> 01:52.284
-After you donated to his "charity."
-But he didn't cash the check.

01:52.284 --> 01:55.604
Because you canceled it. 
What if he has a legitimate excuse?

01:55.604 --> 01:57.334
Unless he's been locked up in gitmo,

01:57.334 --> 01:59.735
He had no reason not to pick up
the phone and call you.

02:01.411 --> 02:02.958
(whispers) I'm such a fool.

02:03.158 --> 02:04.305
No, mom.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.161
You've done nothing wrong.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.746
But he's shown you who he is

02:10.946 --> 02:13.832
An untrustworthy jerk that
doesn't deserve your affections.

02:14.803 --> 02:16.178
(normal voice) you're right.

02:16.578 --> 02:17.746
Good girl.

02:20.782 --> 02:22.647
(sighs) why does it take
six days

02:22.647 --> 02:24.352
To see if an embryo's
turned into a blast?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.421
Yeah, then we have to wait nine
months to see if we made a baby.

02:26.421 --> 02:28.314
(exhales deeply) do you think
any of my embryos

02:28.314 --> 02:31.165
Will make it into a blast?
Yeah, I'm sure that they did, some of 'em.

02:31.165 --> 02:32.905
-Your sperm tested better.
-Yours tested fine.

02:33.205 --> 02:35.127
-Adequate.
-"Adequate" is fine.

02:35.127 --> 02:36.126
This is our file.

02:36.626 --> 02:39.388
Kevin, back away from the desk.
I just want a peek.

02:39.388 --> 02:42.076
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, that's okay. We don't mind.

02:42.076 --> 02:44.142
No, we--we can't wait
to hear the news.

02:44.142 --> 02:47.373
Not that we know what it is. We--we don't.
(whispers) kevin, don't be weird.

02:47.373 --> 02:48.232
Sorry.

02:48.232 --> 02:50.048
Okay, let's see.

02:50.048 --> 02:53.215
Your egg donor produced
ten viable eggs.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.413
You each fertilized five.

02:54.513 --> 02:56.696
And as of this morning,

02:56.730 --> 02:59.384
Eight of those embryos have
progressed into blastocysts.

02:59.384 --> 03:01.618
That's what we want to see.
Oh, my god.

03:01.618 --> 03:04.809
That's incredible.
Right now five of the blasts are yours, kevin,

03:04.809 --> 03:06.056
And three are scotty's.

03:06.056 --> 03:09.416
I'm--I'm--I'm sorry.
Are you s--five out of five?

03:09.416 --> 03:12.146
I can double-check the labs.
Not that three isn't great.

03:12.146 --> 03:13.913
Are you--are you okay? I mean,
are you--are you all right?

03:13.913 --> 03:14.959
Yeah, I'm thrilled.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.712
-That's--
-Now we still need to wait and see

03:16.712 --> 03:18.854
How many of these blasts
become advanced blasts.

03:19.519 --> 03:23.549
-I'll call you in the morning with a progress report.
-Wow, I can't believe this is actually happening.

03:23.549 --> 03:24.942
I know. We're actually gonna be dads.

03:24.942 --> 03:27.599
This--it's freaking me out.
Wow.

03:27.599 --> 03:28.461
Don't be--don't be weird.

03:28.495 --> 03:30.363
Sorry. Sorry.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.626
So are you kicking me out?

03:33.626 --> 03:35.809
Officially, you're on academic probation,

03:35.809 --> 03:38.388
But you are going to have to

03:38.388 --> 03:40.582
Raise your grade point average 2.3 points

03:40.582 --> 03:41.759
If you want to remain in the program.

03:42.459 --> 03:44.413
I've seen this happen time after time.

03:44.413 --> 03:46.041
Students struggle with medical school,

03:46.041 --> 03:48.143
Sometimes even manage to graduate.

03:48.143 --> 03:49.336
And then the boards come up,

03:49.336 --> 03:50.931
And they're unable to pass the exam.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.602
And a degree without a license
is meaningless.

03:53.602 --> 03:56.156
So are--are--are you telling me
I should drop out or...

03:56.156 --> 03:58.252
I just don't want to see you
waste your time.

04:00.227 --> 04:03.454
Uh, and if I decide to stay?

04:03.754 --> 04:05.256
Well, here's a reading list.

04:06.398 --> 04:08.048
The next semester starts in a week.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.638
If you want to stay, I suggest
you put that time to good use.

04:10.638 --> 04:11.742
Okay, I, uh...
(clears throat)

04:11.742 --> 04:13.447
Yeah, I'll go to the library
right away.

04:13.447 --> 04:16.515
Justin, if you are committed
to seeing this through,

04:16.515 --> 04:21.017
-You have to step up.
-Step up. Got it.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.836
Fine. I'll have
my accountant call you.

04:25.645 --> 04:26.685
Mm.
(beep)

04:26.685 --> 04:27.852
(knock on door)
(saul) holly?

04:27.852 --> 04:29.106
Yeah.
Do you mind if I come in?

04:29.106 --> 04:32.778
No.
I, uh, I-I would like to talk to youbout ryan.

04:32.778 --> 04:35.008
I hope he doesn't want
his job back,

04:35.008 --> 04:39.219
Because I just gave someone else his desk.
No, ryan resigned because he wanted to.

04:39.219 --> 04:41.517
In fact, I think he's probably relieved

04:41.517 --> 04:43.733
That he doesn't work here anymore.
He's not the only one.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.965
So I know that you think
that he's responsible

04:45.965 --> 04:49.893
-For the spill at our storage facility--
-No, saul, it wasn't a spill.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.788
We lost our entire stock.

04:52.788 --> 04:55.454
He's gone now, holly.
He can't do any more damage.

04:55.454 --> 04:57.989
But you agree that he did it?

04:57.989 --> 05:00.090
Well, given the amount
of hostility and resentment

05:00.090 --> 05:02.876
He has towards my family,
I would say, yes, it's probable.

05:02.876 --> 05:04.784
But he also donated
his bone marrow to kitty.

05:04.784 --> 05:08.118
Look, what he did for kitty
and for your family

05:08.118 --> 05:11.994
Is incredible, but he is part
of this current investigation.

05:11.994 --> 05:15.216
I just talked to the insurance
adjustors the other day,

05:15.216 --> 05:16.852
And they think
that they have enough evidence

05:16.852 --> 05:19.976
To bring a case against him.
Well, what if we drop the investigation?

05:21.140 --> 05:22.303
W-what?

05:22.303 --> 05:23.627
He wants to start over, holly.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.385
If he's charged
with corporate sabotage--

05:25.385 --> 05:26.266
What do you want from him?

05:26.266 --> 05:29.017
Are--are--are you aware
of what you're asking from me?

05:29.017 --> 05:33.264
They have already proven
that this is not an accident.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.600
If we do not help them
finish this investigation

05:36.600 --> 05:38.320
And we do not act accordingly,

05:38.320 --> 05:42.145
We will get no reimbursement
for our loss.

05:42.145 --> 05:43.572
So we take a hit.
(scoffs)

05:43.572 --> 05:46.333
He's the one responsible
for kitty being well now.

05:48.829 --> 05:49.666
(sighs)

05:52.566 --> 05:55.181
(whispers) fine.

05:56.701 --> 05:57.505
Fine?

05:59.394 --> 06:01.503
What do you wantto say?

06:03.699 --> 06:05.912
I-I'm not gonna argue

06:05.912 --> 06:10.412
That anything is as important
as kitty's life.

06:11.355 --> 06:15.207
Forget how much ryan cost
this company or anyone else,

06:16.378 --> 06:18.181
It's family first.

06:19.206 --> 06:20.776
It's bad business,

06:22.055 --> 06:23.859
But it is the walker way.

06:23.859 --> 06:26.064
Come on, holly. Can't you
understand that this--this--

06:26.064 --> 06:27.240
Oh, saul, please. I get it.

06:28.108 --> 06:32.231
(voice breaking) you want me
to let ryan off the hook

06:32.231 --> 06:34.171
Just like you wanted me

06:34.171 --> 06:37.243
To let tommy off the hook.

06:37.243 --> 06:38.974
It is nothing new.

06:44.894 --> 06:46.835
Is that all?

06:48.019 --> 06:50.198
That's all.

06:51.594 --> 06:52.761
Thank you.

Uh...

07:23.585 --> 07:25.881
Yes. Um, well,

07:26.181 --> 07:28.102
Just one moment, please.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.282
I'll be right there.

07:30.682 --> 07:31.933
Just...

07:32.233 --> 07:33.809
I'm on my way.

07:44.536 --> 07:46.010
Simon, what are you doing here?

07:46.738 --> 07:49.027
I wasn't sure if you were
checking your phone messages.

07:49.027 --> 07:52.070
No, I've been checking them.
I-I've just been very busy.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.769
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting.

07:54.866 --> 07:57.188
I... Thought maybe
if I tried my luck in person,

07:57.188 --> 07:58.699
You'd give me
the chance to explain.

08:00.142 --> 08:03.035
Uh, that was a bad idea.
I'll go.

08:03.035 --> 08:05.909
No, simon. We should talk.

08:05.909 --> 08:08.079
Please come in. We'll talk.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.209
Okay.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.079
(electricity crackles)

08:26.044 --> 08:26.761
And?

08:26.761 --> 08:29.370
That's it. The light goes on.

08:29.370 --> 08:33.076
Oh, wow. I--that--that--that--
That's awesome, isn't it, kevin?

08:33.969 --> 08:35.746
Well, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's awesome.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.494
It's jt--you know what? It's a little hard to see.
Really?

08:38.494 --> 08:38.962
I-I saw it. It's fin

08:38.962 --> 08:41.076
yeah, no, I saw it, too.
I just think--you know what?

08:41.076 --> 08:44.629
<i>I think we could--we could amp
this up. Get it? Amp it up?
(snaps fingers)</i>

08:44.629 --> 08:45.630
I know what a pun is,

08:45.630 --> 08:47.480
<i>I just really didn't get
a charge out of it.</i>

08:47.480 --> 08:49.176
I like you, paige whedon.

08:49.176 --> 08:52.390
(chuckles) so what should we do
to see it better?

08:52.390 --> 08:53.767
Nothing.
The project is perfect.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.446
W--yeah. Yes, it is perfect.
But you know what?

08:57.446 --> 09:00.575
When I walk into a courtroom,
I think of two things, okay?
(groans)

09:00.575 --> 09:03.503
Facts and presentation.
The fact is, the battery works.

09:03.503 --> 09:04.218
Great.

09:04.218 --> 09:08.571
If we could build a bigger battery
And turn on something bigger,

09:08.571 --> 09:10.829
I think we would really wow
the judges.

09:10.829 --> 09:11.549
Like a radio.

09:11.549 --> 09:14.317
Yeah, radio's a good start.
Okay, I'm off to aunt kitty's.

09:14.317 --> 09:16.584
Mom, do we have a radio?
A radio? Why?

09:16.584 --> 09:17.820
Do we have one or not?

09:18.958 --> 09:21.752
Uh, yes. Yes, I think there is
one in the attic.

09:21.752 --> 09:22.527
I'll get it.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.182
(lowered voice) thank you.

09:27.555 --> 09:29.459
She won't let me
near this project.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.141
What can I say?
I think I've got the touch.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.032
(normal voice) have you
ever argued with a tween?

09:33.487 --> 09:35.089
I have. I-I live with him.

09:35.089 --> 09:38.683
-Says the miley fan.
-It's good practice for you two.

09:38.683 --> 09:40.486
-Right?
-Okay, I'm off. I'm off!

09:40.486 --> 09:41.763
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:44.431 --> 09:46.683
You know, if you're not in the mood,
We don't have to do this.

09:46.683 --> 09:48.509
Yeah. No, why--why--why wouldn't
I be in the mood?

09:49.477 --> 09:50.165
No reason.

09:51.810 --> 09:54.039
Okay. Just because you're
feeling full of yourself

09:54.039 --> 09:56.075
Because you have
five healthy embryos...

09:55.863 --> 09:56.863
What are you talking about?

09:56.864 --> 10:00.859
-It doesn't mean that I'm not happy with my three.
-And you should be. Three's great.

10:00.859 --> 10:03.774
Ohmy god. If you could hear yourself right now.
What?

10:04.238 --> 10:05.629
-Kevin, it's not--
-I found one.

10:05.629 --> 10:07.964
Okay. Great.

10:09.624 --> 10:11.362
That's what they call it?
Really?

10:11.362 --> 10:14.252
Bone--bone-break fever? That's its name?
Yes, and for good reason.

10:14.252 --> 10:16.321
I felt like my entire body
was in a vise.

10:17.011 --> 10:18.217
By the time I got over it,

10:18.647 --> 10:21.185
I figured it would be best
to explain it to you in person,

10:21.804 --> 10:24.063
And that was a-a bad call.

10:25.570 --> 10:28.215
Oh, just--wait a second.
Just go--go back.

10:28.215 --> 10:30.139
What--what--what happened now

10:30.139 --> 10:32.132
With the community bank
you started?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.925
Well, as soon as I found out
this guy carlsson

10:33.925 --> 10:38.050
-Was stealing from me, I flew straight to guatemala.
-I thought you flew straight to florida.

10:38.050 --> 10:39.809
No, that was a-that was a layover.

10:39.809 --> 10:42.045
But as it turned out,
the president of the bank

10:42.045 --> 10:44.455
Was also on to him,
so when I got to guatemala city,

10:44.455 --> 10:46.416
We just turned him over to 
the authorities.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.320
And then that's when you went
into the jungle?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.194
Uh, right. I wanted
to check on my projects.

10:50.194 --> 10:51.467
They were all up and running,

10:51.467 --> 10:53.038
And everything would have
been great

10:53.038 --> 10:58.187
If it hadn't been for that one
mosquito bite, and... (laughs)

10:58.187 --> 11:00.804
I'm--you don't believe a word
I'm saying, do you? I...

11:00.804 --> 11:03.498
No, I-I do. I do. I-I do.

11:03.498 --> 11:05.697
-I believe you.
-Nora, do you know what worried me the most?

11:05.897 --> 11:08.956
Is that you would think
that's what I would do to you,

11:08.956 --> 11:12.077
-Try and take your money.
-No. I...

11:13.639 --> 11:16.083
Well, I, you know,
I have to be honest,

11:16.083 --> 11:18.157
I've been confused.

11:18.157 --> 11:19.774
I-I've been worried.

11:19.774 --> 11:22.114
-And...
-Nora.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.696
I don't know. I started
to think it was all a dream--

11:23.696 --> 11:26.910
-Whatever we were.
-I'm sorry I put you through this,

11:26.910 --> 11:29.660
Especially when kitty's going
through something much worse.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.890
I wish I could have been here
to help.

11:33.937 --> 11:36.574
Well, she's in remission now,
and that's all that counts.

11:36.574 --> 11:37.300
Mm-hmm.

11:43.265 --> 11:45.496
I know we can't pick up
right where we left off.

11:45.512 --> 11:46.266
I know that.

11:48.057 --> 11:49.635
But can I least see you again?

11:52.385 --> 11:53.596
Well, I-I'm just...

11:54.864 --> 11:56.019
I just need some time.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.875
-I understand.
-Okay.

11:58.399 --> 11:59.156
I'll wait.

12:00.397 --> 12:01.190
I'm persistent.

12:01.190 --> 12:02.426
I'll wait.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.202
Okay.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.734
So finally in a mood to sell?

12:07.924 --> 12:10.727
We'll see. We haven't started
negotiating yet.

12:10.727 --> 12:12.799
Holly, my offer is
more than fair.

12:13.362 --> 12:16.507
Yeah, if I were only selling
a couple of shares.

12:16.507 --> 12:20.741
But you would have a major say
in how this company was run,

12:20.741 --> 12:22.868
So that has to be figured
into the price as well.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.594
It is. 250 is already over value.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.233
(indistinct conversations)

12:29.791 --> 12:32.137
0 a share.

12:32.137 --> 12:32.846
(laughs)

12:33.418 --> 12:34.381
That's...

12:35.418 --> 12:36.350
You're kidding, right?

12:36.350 --> 12:38.444
(chuckles)
everyone has a price.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.110
That's mine.

12:40.110 --> 12:41.629
400? That's crazy.

12:41.629 --> 12:42.727
See, I don't think so.

12:44.108 --> 12:46.457
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

12:46.457 --> 12:49.825
But you have been waiting
for this opportunity

12:49.825 --> 12:51.538
Your whole life.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.637
Ojai foods was yours,
not william walker's.

12:54.637 --> 12:56.700
Isn't that the way
that you see it?

12:57.331 --> 13:00.069
But he landed you in jail

13:00.069 --> 13:02.465
And he took the whole thing
for himself.

13:02.465 --> 13:06.485
So I am offering you a chance
to get it back

13:06.485 --> 13:09.402
And to wield power
over his entire family.

13:11.198 --> 13:14.819
Now, dennis, if revenge
is what you're after,

13:15.653 --> 13:18.562
Then $400 is a steal.

13:20.838 --> 13:21.686
Pfft.

13:22.317 --> 13:23.885
You're really persuasive.

13:26.229 --> 13:27.793
350, and that's final.

13:30.531 --> 13:32.054
That's an offer worth considering.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.550
I'll think about it.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.233
48 hours, and it's off the table.

13:36.920 --> 13:37.862
Understood.

13:39.215 --> 13:40.634
Holly.
Hmm?

13:40.634 --> 13:43.753
Just out of curiosity,
when we last spoke, um,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.765
You had no interest in selling.
What changed your mind?

13:48.673 --> 13:52.094
The walkers come with
a whole lot of family drama.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.509
I'm getting real tired of it.

13:56.055 --> 13:57.313
See you, dennis.

14:02.116 --> 14:03.367
Hey.
Hey.

14:04.023 --> 14:04.835
What do you got there?

14:05.605 --> 14:08.061
Well, my o.B. Says that I need
more calcium in my diet,

14:08.061 --> 14:09.442
And since I hate milk--

14:09.755 --> 14:12.977
Chocolate, chocolate chip,
chocolate chip cookie dough.

14:13.077 --> 14:15.428
Tting a jump
on the next semester?

14:15.428 --> 14:18.638
No. I'm getting a jump
on electrons and electrodes.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.924
Sarah asked me and kev to help
paige with her science project.

14:20.924 --> 14:22.008
You have time for that?

14:22.008 --> 14:23.690
Are you implying
I don't have time for that?

14:23.690 --> 14:24.511
Honest answer?

14:24.511 --> 14:26.444
I'm a little surprised
that you're helping paige

14:26.444 --> 14:28.604
When your advisor gave you
a reading list a mile long.

14:28.604 --> 14:30.144
I mean, does sarah even know
what's going on?

14:30.144 --> 14:31.966
Does she know I'm failing
out of medical school? No.

14:31.966 --> 14:34.588
-And she's not gonna find out.
-I'm sure she'd understand.

14:34.588 --> 14:36.318
There's nothing to understand.
I don't even understand.

14:36.318 --> 14:37.251
I studied for these exams.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.083
Did you tell them about kitty
or, I don't know,

14:39.083 --> 14:40.553
That you just found out that
you're gonna be a new father?

14:40.553 --> 14:42.540
Yeah, I did. And you know
what i sounds like?

14:42.540 --> 14:43.827
It sounds like
"my dog ate my homework."

14:47.275 --> 14:48.447
He thinks I should drop out.
Poon clatters)

14:48.447 --> 14:52.631
How cod he say that? He's your advisor.
Yeah, well, that was his advice.

14:52.631 --> 14:55.363
Well, that's ridiculous. You'r.
Okay, rebecca, you know what?

14:55.363 --> 14:56.761
I don't need
the encouraging thing right now.

14:56.761 --> 14:58.465
I'm past needing a cheerleader.
Maybe he's right.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.017
You know, maybe I don't have
what it takes to finish.

15:01.017 --> 15:02.611
I'm sure that everyone
inour class thinks that--

15:02.611 --> 15:05.549
But they're not on probation.
I don't know. All right?

15:05.549 --> 15:06.798
I'm not making a decision
right now.

15:06.798 --> 15:08.443
Where are you going?
We need to talk about this.

15:08.443 --> 15:09.616
Look, I can't think about this,
all right? I'm late.

15:12.251 --> 15:13.148
(door closes)

15:16.783 --> 15:20.105
1.23 watts.
Okay, more lemons, doctor, stat.

15:20.105 --> 15:22.520
Stop calling me "doctor."
and why did we pay for these?

15:22.520 --> 15:23.433
We own a fruit company.

15:23.433 --> 15:25.263
Well, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

15:25.264 --> 15:26.865
Okay, how are we doing
on this display?

15:26.865 --> 15:30.463
We are still glittering.
My father would be so proud.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.841
Great. Make sure
you get the corner

15:31.841 --> 15:34.176
Right. I don't know why I'm so worried
about being a dad.

15:34.176 --> 15:35.514
I think I was born to do this.

15:35.514 --> 15:37.168
(justin)
whoa. Look at this thing.

15:37.544 --> 15:39.198
Remember when we used to
steal this out of sarah's room

15:39.198 --> 15:41.468
And take it to the beach?
Yeah, can we forget
the "back in the day" speech

15:41.468 --> 15:43.298
And concentrate
on the dancing hamster?

15:44.594 --> 15:48.032
Uh, no dancing hamster.
What do you mean, no dan--

15:48.032 --> 15:50.030
How can they be
out of dancing hamsters?

15:50.030 --> 15:53.059
-That's the key to our success.
-A dancing rodent is the key?

15:53.059 --> 15:54.751
Yeah, make the judges laugh--
that's basic.

15:54.751 --> 15:58.024
-Did you check aisle seven?
-I did, and that's what I got.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.254
Of course you picked a robot.
How butch.

16:00.254 --> 16:01.549
Wait. How is a robot butch?

16:02.325 --> 16:04.297
Why don't you turn it on?
(whirring)

16:04.888 --> 16:06.945
-Yeah!
-(paige) awesome.

16:08.323 --> 16:09.796
Okay, that's pretty butch.

16:09.796 --> 16:12.267
See, a science project is about science.
I beg to differ.

16:12.267 --> 16:15.528
Paige, don't let anyone tell you
winning doesn't matter. It does.

16:20.308 --> 16:21.727
Aren't you gonna
tell me, "no, it doesn't"?

16:21.727 --> 16:23.222
If you can't do it,
you can't do it. Right?

16:23.222 --> 16:24.030
<i>That's the way the world works.</i>

16:24.872 --> 16:27.512
Wow. Medical school is
teaching you something.

16:27.512 --> 16:28.585
You have no idea.

16:28.585 --> 16:30.317
You know, I think what
your uncles are trying to say

16:30.317 --> 16:32.335
Is that it's learning
that's important.

16:32.735 --> 16:33.320
Uh-huh.

16:34.207 --> 16:37.195
So what about the disco balls?
Are we still using them?

16:37.395 --> 16:38.999
Absolutely.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.970
Our brother kevin,
who did the baking soda volcano

16:42.970 --> 16:45.689
-Six years in a row?
-Dressed as a wizard, don't forget.

16:45.689 --> 16:47.117
-And justin's there, too.
-Mm-hmm.

16:47.117 --> 16:49.591
Well, oh, oh, well, now that's
a good idea. You know, justin--

16:49.591 --> 16:51.972
Justin who just didn't do his
science projects altogether.

16:51.972 --> 16:54.055
Well, considering how much
I helped him at school,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.447
He owes me big-time.
But I'm just glad that paige

16:56.447 --> 16:59.038
Accepts their help, because god
knows, she does not want mine.

16:59.038 --> 16:59.746
Sweetheart,
are you all right?

16:59.746 --> 17:01.369
I'm fine.
I just always keep checking

17:01.369 --> 17:02.557
To see if it's swelling.

17:04.559 --> 17:06.565
You're feeling better,
though, right?

17:06.565 --> 17:08.227
I am.
It's just a very bad habit.

17:08.227 --> 17:11.377
As a matter of fact, I spoke
with dr. Avadon yesterday,

17:11.377 --> 17:14.089
Who told me that my white blood
cell count--higher than ever.

17:14.089 --> 17:15.387
Yay! Yay!

17:15.387 --> 17:16.472
Yeah.
Unbelievable, kitty.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.311
How is it having robert home?

17:19.311 --> 17:20.972
Oh, well, it's, um,

17:20.972 --> 17:23.473
You know, it's really,
really nice for me.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.609
-I--he says he's happy.
-But you don't think he is happy?

17:26.609 --> 17:28.030
I just think he misses
the campaign.

17:28.030 --> 17:30.060
Well, it would be weird
if he didn't miss it.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.870
I mean, it's hard
to say good-bye

17:31.870 --> 17:34.608
-To somethingou deeply and truly love.
-That's true.

17:34.608 --> 17:37.246
But you do it. You do it.
You say, "hasta la vista," baby.

17:37.246 --> 17:39.085
Stop. Stop.

17:39.085 --> 17:40.328
Mom.
Wait. What are we stopping?

17:40.328 --> 17:42.658
You're taking him back.
I haven't. I haven't made any decisions.

17:42.658 --> 17:43.454
Ugh. This is a bad mistake.
Decisions about what?

17:45.193 --> 17:47.292
-Simon's back.
-Oh, my god.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.835
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, my god. You're kidding me.

17:48.835 --> 17:53.789
He had the nerve to show his face?
Mnh-mnh. That would require bravery. He just called.

17:53.789 --> 17:57.913
He came to the house, actually.
What? You saidyou weren't gonna see him.

17:57.913 --> 18:01.229
He showed up on my doorstep,
begging me to just hear him out.

18:01.229 --> 18:03.030
Sarah, just because
I hear what he has to say

18:03.030 --> 18:06.000
Does not make me the village idiot.
No, but believing him does.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.439
-Oh, she didn't mean that.
-Yes, she did.

18:07.439 --> 18:10.628
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
I did, very much. 100%.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.833
-But she meant it out of love and concern.
-I can totally, totally tell you did.

18:12.833 --> 18:16.483
Yes, I'm very protective.
You're too forgiving, mom.

18:16.483 --> 18:18.405
I'm an adult. I can take care
of my own affairs.

18:18.405 --> 18:21.893
-Well, I'm not gonna stop worrying abo you.
-Look, you know, sarah,

18:21.893 --> 18:24.172
I think that in this case, mom is right. I mean, th--
what?

18:24.172 --> 18:26.401
Well, we're always bitching
that she butts into our lives.

18:26.401 --> 18:29.091
So let's just stop butting into hers.
Thank you...

18:30.895 --> 18:31.859
I think.

18:31.859 --> 18:34.285
How about now?

18:35.700 --> 18:36.204
Nope.

18:36.204 --> 18:38.726
What do you mean, "nope"?
I mean we don't have enough volts.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.183
Unless you don't understand
the basic concept

18:42.446 --> 18:45.241
Do you want to help me
make something in the kitchen?

18:45.726 --> 18:47.201
Can I, uncle kevin?

18:47.201 --> 18:49.398
Absolutely, as long
as it doesn't involve fruit.

18:50.061 --> 18:53.716
Are we really out of lemons?
Look, paige said the radio was fine.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.367
-That's not enough.
-It's enough for her.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.790
Look, this is gonna work, okay,
so don't give up so easily.

18:57.790 --> 19:00.265
You know what?
Fine. Jeez. You do it.

19:02.102 --> 19:02.956
What are you doing?

19:02.956 --> 19:05.898
Look, I'm done. You obviously
know what it takes to succeed,

19:05.898 --> 19:07.783
So just--you finish it.

19:10.129 --> 19:11.536
All right, what's going on with you?

19:11.536 --> 19:13.020
I can't watch you take over
paige's project.

19:13.529 --> 19:15.471
I mean, do--do you honestly
think it helps her?

19:15.471 --> 19:19.077
Because it doesn't, kevin.
So what if she wins now?

19:19.077 --> 19:20.306
All right, someday
she'll be in a place

19:20.306 --> 19:21.925
Where no one can help her
and it's all on her.

19:21.925 --> 19:24.872
-And then what?
-Justin, she's in sixth grade.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.309
Yeah, and so was I. And I might
have learned something

19:27.309 --> 19:28.590
If you and everybody else
in this family

19:28.590 --> 19:29.704
Didn't do everything for me.

19:29.704 --> 19:32.212
I'm sorry. What are you talking
about? You're in medical school.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.405
Yeah, and I'm failing out.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.013
-What?
-I'm on academic probation,

19:40.013 --> 19:41.390
And they're trying
to kick me out.

19:42.409 --> 19:43.732
Oh, god.

19:46.637 --> 19:48.431
All right. Um...

19:49.707 --> 19:50.405
Does mom know?

19:50.405 --> 19:53.053
Kevin, I'm a grown man. They
don't send report cards home.

19:53.954 --> 19:55.774
But it doesn't matter,
because I'm gonna drop out.

19:56.747 --> 19:59.960
Look, I gotta go.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.962
Please tell paige
everything's okay,

20:01.962 --> 20:03.301
And I'll see her
at the science fair.

20:11.839 --> 20:14.741
(indistinct conversations)

20:33.895 --> 20:37.230
(keypad beeping)

20:37.265 --> 20:39.099
(beep)

20:39.133 --> 20:41.201
(phone rings)

20:41.235 --> 20:42.084
(ring)

20:43.549 --> 20:44.255
Sarah, where are you?

20:44.255 --> 20:46.735
Paige wanted some space.
Why? Is everything okay?

20:46.735 --> 20:48.293
No, it is not. It's a disaster.

20:48.294 --> 20:50.299
Henry's earthquake simulator
is out-of-control.

20:50.299 --> 20:52.372
-And there is no way he made any of it.
-You don't know that.

20:52.372 --> 20:54.607
-Yes, I do. Where are you?
-I'm about to leave.

20:54.607 --> 20:58.363
-But listen, I found out this thing about simon.
-Simon? Who is si--what, mom's simon?

20:58.363 --> 20:59.317
I googled him again.

20:59.317 --> 21:03.301
There's this picture of him from
some boca raton society page.

21:03.301 --> 21:06.557
He's at a benefit with an older,
attractive woman on his arm--

21:07.020 --> 21:09.519
Marilyn weisman.
Maybe he has a thing for older women.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.340
No. But what if he has one
in every city?

21:12.340 --> 21:14.847
-Don't you think I should tell mom?
-No, I think you should forget about simon

21:14.847 --> 21:16.348
-And start thinking about henry.
-Don't you mean paige?

21:16.348 --> 21:19.118
No. I mean, yeah. J--look, just get down here.
(beep)

21:19.118 --> 21:19.966
(beep)
cooper.

21:19.966 --> 21:21.852
(all talking at once)

21:25.508 --> 21:27.576
Wow, paige. I gotta say,
it looks fantastic.

21:27.576 --> 21:30.757
-(rebecca) yeah, really.
-Do you think it's better han henry's?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.492
-Oh, yeah.
-Who's henry? Your nemesis?

21:32.492 --> 21:36.214
It's more like kevin's nemesis.
(cell phone ringing)

21:36.214 --> 21:39.325
(beep) hi. Could you wait one second
for me?

21:39.325 --> 21:41.557
-Have you seen kevin?
-Uh, yeah, I saw him just a second ago.

21:41.557 --> 21:42.919
-You want me to find him?
-Yeah. Tell him it's important.

21:42.919 --> 21:44.885
-Okay.
-Yes, uh, doctor, go ahead.

21:44.885 --> 21:47.713
Just need to make
a few little tweaks here.

21:51.826 --> 21:52.713
Hi.

21:53.705 --> 21:55.022
Interested in earthquakes?
(chuckles)

21:55.022 --> 21:57.306
I'm sure henry can answer
any of your questions.

21:57.306 --> 22:01.029
Actually, yeah, I do have
a couple of questions, henry.
(mouths word)

22:01.029 --> 22:04.361
Paige, look at that!
It's gigantic.

22:04.361 --> 22:06.633
(gasps) oh, my gosh.

22:06.633 --> 22:08.642
I can't believe
you did all of this.

22:08.642 --> 22:10.866
Well, uncle kevin thought of it

22:10.866 --> 22:12.975
And uncle justin did
the battery work.

22:12.975 --> 22:17.559
-Wait till you see the robot start dancing.
-Is he gonna dance?

22:17.559 --> 22:19.119
That's what the disco balls are for.

22:19.119 --> 22:22.576
Oh, yes, of course.
Well, that's obvious.

22:22.576 --> 22:24.568
Terrific work, justin.

22:24.568 --> 22:26.906
Now you see, paige, if you keep
working on your science,

22:26.906 --> 22:30.711
-Maybe one day you, too, will end up in med school.
-I want to be fashion designer.

22:30.711 --> 22:32.987
-Uh, you know, I'm gonna, uh...
-Well, yes, that's good, too.

22:32.987 --> 22:35.333
-I'm gonna go, uh, go find, uh, rebecca.
-Are you okay?

22:35.333 --> 22:36.844
(justi) yes. Paige's moment.
Paige's moment.

22:38.995 --> 22:41.530
Okay, so what--what does--
what does he dance to?

22:41.530 --> 22:44.353
-Disco.
-Don't tell me that was kevin's idea.

22:44.353 --> 22:46.293
Right,nd you figured
this equation out yourself?

22:46.293 --> 22:48.973
It wasn't hard.
My manipulated variable is

22:48.973 --> 22:50.506
The building's
construction material.

22:50.506 --> 22:52.426
My responding variable is
how long it takes

22:52.426 --> 22:53.103
For the building to collapse.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.343
Right. And how long did it take
to build the model?

22:55.343 --> 22:55.946
A couple days.

22:55.946 --> 22:58.217
A couple of days? What's your
superpower, architecture?

22:58.820 --> 23:00.685
(lowered voice) seriously,
one dad to another,

23:00.685 --> 23:03.858
You, um, you built most of this
yourself, right?

23:04.831 --> 23:06.571
I'm sorry.
Whose father are you?

23:08.137 --> 23:09.129
That's not relevant.

23:09.129 --> 23:10.557
-What's your name?
-Sterling.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.093
(scotty) kevin. Sterling kevin. Good luck.

23:13.093 --> 23:14.341
What are you doing?

23:14.341 --> 23:16.608
-I practically had him disqualified.
-I talked to the clinic.

23:16.608 --> 23:19.281
-What? Really? And?
-Yeah. Well, it's not great.

23:19.281 --> 23:21.205
Only four of ours made it
to advanced blasts.

23:21.205 --> 23:23.451
(gasps) you're kidding.

23:23.451 --> 23:25.808
I'm trying to not get depressed.
I mean, we still have four.

23:25.808 --> 23:27.026
-Of course. Of course.
-Yeah.

23:27.026 --> 23:29.364
No, you're absolutely right.
Our baby's our baby.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.693
Did... Any of yours make it?

23:32.693 --> 23:35.537
Oh. No, actually,

23:35.537 --> 23:38.087
<i>The--the four
that didn't make it are yours.</i>

23:38.087 --> 23:39.380
Mine are all good.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.502
I lost four?

23:41.502 --> 23:43.143
The doctor said
there's no rhyme or reason.

23:43.143 --> 23:45.183
I mean, y-your embryo
could end up becoming the one.

23:47.497 --> 23:49.948
-Are you okay? Because I know that--
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

23:49.948 --> 23:52.875
Look, I knew we didn't have
any control over this.

23:52.875 --> 23:56.570
-So I should...I should get back to paige.
-Do you want to talk about this?

23:56.570 --> 23:57.848
No, no, I don't. I'm fine.

23:58.472 --> 24:00.633
Oh, wow, paige.

24:00.633 --> 24:04.029
Didn't this turn out great?
I love it!

24:04.029 --> 24:05.333
It's so bright,

24:05.333 --> 24:08.107
And the information is
very well laid out.

24:08.107 --> 24:10.412
-Coop, what do you think?
-Can I g?

24:10.412 --> 24:12.981
Yeah, sure. Don't stick your
finger in it, though, okay?

24:12.981 --> 24:14.020
What took you so long?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.453
Uh, well, I-I got the impression

24:16.453 --> 24:18.193
That you kinda wanted some space.

24:18.193 --> 24:21.369
-Whatever.
-Wow. I really can't win with you these days.

24:22.022 --> 24:23.436
Um, where's grandma?
Is she here?

24:23.436 --> 24:24.868
She went to look at some booths.

24:24.868 --> 24:26.625
Why don't you go
and look at some, too?

24:28.606 --> 24:30.674
Yeah, why don't I?

24:32.104 --> 24:33.287
(whispers) psst!
Is she gone?

24:33.287 --> 24:35.750
-Yeah.
-(normal voice) okay, huddle up.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.024
I've been doing
some reconnaissance.

24:37.024 --> 24:39.530
-Reconnaissance?
-Sizing up the competition.

24:39.530 --> 24:42.997
Seriously lame, but you're right
about that henry kid, so I think

24:42.997 --> 24:45.149
We pump up the volume,
squeeze in a few more oranges.

24:45.149 --> 24:47.559
-Do we have enough time?
-Yeah, but we gotta get going.

24:50.165 --> 24:52.736
-(sighs) mom, there you are.
-Sarah. Sarah, look.

24:52.736 --> 24:53.739
No, listen--
th-this young--

24:53.739 --> 24:55.105
This young woman
has--has found out

24:55.105 --> 24:57.763
That it's better to water plants
with water than with soda.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.283
That's a stunning finding.

25:00.283 --> 25:03.290
-Mom, could I talk to you, please? Listen.
-Yes.

25:03.290 --> 25:05.654
I know simon gave you
an explanation,

25:05.654 --> 25:09.773
-But I found something out about him.
-(sighs) sarah, what part
of "I can handle it"

25:09.773 --> 25:14.316
-Don't you understand, huh?
-Listen, I was just--I was
looking around online and--

25:14.316 --> 25:15.676
What, are you spying on him again?

25:15.676 --> 25:18.096
Well, googling is not spying.

25:18.096 --> 25:19.486
It's social networking.

25:19.486 --> 25:22.227
Anyway, listen, I know
that you're fond of him,

25:22.227 --> 25:26.437
-But I found something out about him--
-There is nothing about simon
that I don't already know.

25:26.727 --> 25:29.223
God, what--what is this guy's
power over you?

25:29.223 --> 25:32.145
My god, now you're insulting me.
He has no power over me.
(cell phone ringing)

25:32.145 --> 25:34.344
-I know exactly what I'm doing.
-Mom, just--

25:34.344 --> 25:36.954
And this is him here.
I'm gonna take the call.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.684
-Fine. I wash my hands of it.
-Okay.

25:38.684 --> 25:40.095
(beeps)
hi.

25:40.698 --> 25:42.841
Kevin, be careful. None of that
fruit's glued to those boxes.

25:42.841 --> 25:46.375
-Kevin, what are you doing? I already set this up.
-We want the robot to dance longer.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.351
-To dance longer? 
-Justin, you have to come see this booth.

25:48.351 --> 25:50.005
It's all about the brain and how
it processes information.

25:50.005 --> 25:51.081
Not right now.
Kevin, what's your problem?

25:51.081 --> 25:52.836
Look, I'm not giving up on
victory, okay?

25:52.836 --> 25:55.441
-I know that's not how you look at the world.
-'cause you're such a role model?

25:55.441 --> 25:57.587
-Justin, can you just come and--
-not right now, all right? You know what?

25:57.587 --> 25:59.675
Watching you act like this, I
know I made the right decision.

25:59.564 --> 26:00.319
(rebecca) what decision?

26:00.319 --> 26:02.078
Hey, come on, guys.
What's goingn?

26:02.078 --> 26:04.567
-You're supposed to be finished.
-The judging is about ready to start.

26:04.567 --> 26:07.025
-I know. I know. One more and we're there.
-You really think there's room for one more?

26:07.025 --> 26:08.534
-Yeah.
-(justin) kevin, look, it's gonna topple over.

26:08.534 --> 26:11.373
-Would you all be quiet and let me do this?
-(justin) kevin! Kevin!

26:11.835 --> 26:12.548
(all shouting indistinctly)

26:12.950 --> 26:13.743
(sarah) oh!

26:25.152 --> 26:26.779
Paige, I am so sorry.

26:27.156 --> 26:29.485
(nora) oh, it's all right. Don't panic.
(sarah) no, no, no.

26:29.485 --> 26:31.211
We'll pick them all up, one at a time.
Paige, I promise, we'll fix this.

26:31.211 --> 26:34.126
No, it's ruined
because you had to butt in!

26:34.126 --> 26:37.396
Why can't you just stay out
of it and let me do it myself?

26:44.350 --> 26:47.670
You know what they say--
don't cry over spilled fruit.

26:50.164 --> 26:51.194
Sorry. Un-unfunny.

26:51.194 --> 26:52.385
Oh, no. It's not that.

26:52.385 --> 26:55.007
It's just this whole
citrus debacle is my fault.

26:55.007 --> 26:56.180
Actually, I was watching,

26:56.180 --> 26:58.120
And unless you made those lemons
fall with your mind,

26:58.120 --> 27:01.053
You're in the clr.
Oh, no, trust me. She didn't want my help.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.138
She told me again and again.
But did I listen? No.

27:03.138 --> 27:07.468
I, uh, forced her uncles
upon her, so now she hates me.

27:07.468 --> 27:09.328
Listen, if it makes you
feel any better,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.753
My, uh, daughter forbade me
to come

27:11.753 --> 27:14.088
Within 10 feet of her booth.
Apparently everything I do is

27:14.088 --> 27:16.538
A colossal threat to her
precarious social standing.

27:16.538 --> 27:18.190
Sounds like she's been
hanging out with paige.

27:18.190 --> 27:20.639
(chuckles)
oh, I don't know if it's the c--I do not--

27:20.639 --> 27:21.180
You're doing it.

27:21.180 --> 27:24.548
You just connect the one
to the other, right? I think.

27:25.801 --> 27:28.668
Yeah, I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

27:28.668 --> 27:30.973
I-I don't think it's you.
I mean, I think it's the age.

27:30.973 --> 27:32.834
God help us
when they're teenagers, huh?

27:32.834 --> 27:35.868
I know. I thought my ex would be
better equipped to deal with it.

27:35.868 --> 27:37.849
Turns out she fights
with libby more than I do.

27:37.849 --> 27:39.633
Oh, you're divorced.

27:40.859 --> 27:41.627
Me, too.

27:42.233 --> 27:43.285
I don't know.

27:44.101 --> 27:46.501
Maybe I should just stay out
of everybody's business.

27:46.501 --> 27:47.905
She'll always be
your daughter.

27:47.905 --> 27:51.721
Uh, yeah. Problem is,
my mother feels the same way.

27:51.721 --> 27:53.490
(chuckles)
I can't help you there.

27:53.490 --> 27:56.840
(chuckles) yeah, right.
Yeah.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.339
Um, this little guy's gotta go in. Do you mind?
No, not at all.

27:59.339 --> 28:03.414
Thank you. What did you say
your name was?
Roy.

28:03.414 --> 28:06.470
Thank you. 
Um, I'm sarah.

28:06.470 --> 28:09.913
So how does this work?
So it's call sensory integration.

28:09.913 --> 28:12.017
You have your five senses.
You have your touch,

28:12.017 --> 28:14.556
Your sight, your smell, your taste

28:14.556 --> 28:16.282
And, of course, your hearing.
Mm-hmm.

28:16.282 --> 28:18.221
And they all connect
to different parts of the brain.

28:18.221 --> 28:22.499
Go ahead. You can try it.
Yeah. Um, all right.

28:22.499 --> 28:24.175
So I take the marble,
put it in the, uh,

28:24.175 --> 28:26.505
Put it in the eye right there.

28:28.627 --> 28:31.346
Ah. See, the eyes
took a picture of it,

28:31.346 --> 28:34.169
But the brain didn't know what
to do with it, so it got lost.

28:35.699 --> 28:38.006
Uh, is--is that what happens to you?

28:38.006 --> 28:41.175
Nah. It's more like
I know what I want to say,

28:41.175 --> 28:43.051
But when I go
to write it down,

28:43.051 --> 28:45.534
My brain gets
all the information confused.

28:46.936 --> 28:48.569
Well, that--that sounds like a bummer.

28:48.569 --> 28:50.406
I just wish I figured it out
a lot sooner.

28:50.406 --> 28:54.815
Third grade woulhave been more fun.
Yeah. You're telling me.

28:54.815 --> 28:56.988
Mm, hey, rebecca.

28:56.988 --> 28:57.844
Hey, alex.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.825
It's a pretty great project,
isn't it?

29:00.825 --> 29:01.999
Yeah, it is.

29:02.893 --> 29:04.946
I just thought...

29:04.946 --> 29:08.320
You know, you--you talk about
how hard you study,

29:08.320 --> 29:10.753
And--and you take these tests
and you think that you aced them

29:10.753 --> 29:12.165
And then you don't
and you don't know why.

29:12.165 --> 29:12.921
No, I...

29:12.921 --> 29:16.378
Ma-maybe I should get tested.

29:16.378 --> 29:17.541
I think you should.

29:21.556 --> 29:24.351
There you are.

29:28.030 --> 29:29.103
Do you mind if I join you?

29:29.103 --> 29:30.657
We--we don't--
we don't have to talk.

29:30.657 --> 29:33.700
You can just yell at me.
Or, you know, maybe I'll talk.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.371
Because, paige, this really
isn't your mom's fault.

29:37.371 --> 29:38.681
Okay? It's my fault,

29:38.681 --> 29:42.097
<i>And I am really,
really, really sorry.</i>

29:42.097 --> 29:44.552
(sighs)

29:45.805 --> 29:48.316
U know,
when I was your age,

29:48.316 --> 29:51.280
I was, um,
I was teased a lot.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.383
Because you were gay?

29:53.383 --> 29:54.517
Uh...

29:54.517 --> 29:57.698
Yeah, well, m-maybe.

29:57.698 --> 30:00.059
Although,
nobody really knew back then.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.556
I was a really weird kid.

30:02.556 --> 30:04.642
I mean, for my sixth grade
talent show,

30:04.642 --> 30:06.506
I sang a medley
from "grease,"

30:06.506 --> 30:09.156
Including the sandy numbers.

30:09.156 --> 30:11.456
And you don't think anyone knew
you were gay?

30:11.456 --> 30:14.055
That's not the point.

30:14.055 --> 30:16.162
I was trying
to prove something.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.879
That you're not gay?

30:17.879 --> 30:18.770
No, that...

30:18.770 --> 30:21.946
That I--that I wasn't a dork.

30:21.946 --> 30:25.407
So my science project was
all about your dorkiness?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.638
Yeah.

30:27.638 --> 30:29.032
Kinda.

30:31.723 --> 30:33.299
You know, the sad thing is,

30:33.299 --> 30:36.126
Scotty and I, we're trying
so hard to be dads,

30:36.126 --> 30:38.409
And I think I just screwed up
the first test-drive.

30:38.409 --> 30:39.927
Don't worry.

30:39.927 --> 30:42.620
It's not like you're gonna get
a 12 year old right off the bat.

30:44.904 --> 30:49.172
Okay, so how do I
make it up to you?

30:49.172 --> 30:51.833
Can we just sneak out back
and get out of here?

30:53.246 --> 30:54.639
We could.
We could just do tt.

30:54.639 --> 30:57.244
Or...

30:57.244 --> 31:01.139
You could walk back in there
with your head held high

31:01.139 --> 31:03.003
-And presenyour project.
-But it fell apart.

31:03.003 --> 31:06.043
<i>No, my project fell apart.</i>

31:06.077 --> 31:08.045
Yours didn't.

31:08.079 --> 31:11.248
(darden smith's "perfect moment"
playing)

31:11.282 --> 31:14.518
-So did kevin find her?
-I don't know.

31:14.552 --> 31:16.839
Okay, we're gonna have to stall,
because she's up next.

31:16.839 --> 31:19.307
-Uh, paige whedon?
-Uh, she's in the ladies' room.

31:19.307 --> 31:21.830
-yeah, just a minute.
-No, wait. I'm here.

31:22.876 --> 31:23.876
(whispers) go get 'em.

31:23.876 --> 31:27.031
âª rain falls down
on the desert sand âª

31:27.065 --> 31:28.799
Um...

31:28.833 --> 31:32.403
My science project illustrates
how a battery can be made

31:32.437 --> 31:34.171
Using citrus fruit.

31:34.205 --> 31:37.608
It was a lot bigger,
but it got knocked down.

31:37.642 --> 31:41.311
But that's okay. I can still
show you the principle.

31:41.346 --> 31:44.281
I used two different types
of metals--

31:44.315 --> 31:46.083
Copper and zinc.

31:46.117 --> 31:48.585
When you squeeze the lemon,

31:48.620 --> 31:51.989
The juice acts as a conductor,

31:52.023 --> 31:54.124
And the electrons flow
through the wires

31:54.159 --> 31:55.993
In one direction.

31:56.027 --> 31:58.162
There you go. A battery.

31:58.196 --> 32:00.431
(nora) oh.
(justin) yay!

32:00.465 --> 32:01.732
Yay!

32:01.766 --> 32:04.601
âª you called to me
and I turned around âª

32:04.636 --> 32:07.805
âª in a perfect moment âª

32:07.839 --> 32:10.240
I'm telling you,
it's the wrong move.

32:10.275 --> 32:13.744
How? If york is willing to buy
your shares at that price,

32:13.778 --> 32:16.163
That's gonna more than make up
For what you lost in your savings.

32:16.163 --> 32:18.455
And if this is
about rebecca and justin,

32:18.455 --> 32:19.936
You're gonna be
in a much better position

32:19.936 --> 32:22.137
To help them with the baby
if you make this sale.

32:22.137 --> 32:23.868
No, see, you're just not getting it.

32:23.868 --> 32:28.659
I countered with
this huge amount to test him.

32:28.693 --> 32:32.663
He was already paying way more
than he should have been,

32:32.697 --> 32:35.566
And lo and behold, he bit.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.203
He came all the way up to 350,
which is insane.

32:39.237 --> 32:41.171
Well, he is insane.

32:41.206 --> 32:44.141
I mean, he has this ancient
grudge against william walker.

32:44.175 --> 32:47.411
He's obsessed with a dead man.
He's worse than you are.

32:47.445 --> 32:50.614
Trust me, david. I have looked
at this at every single angle.

32:50.648 --> 32:53.117
I mean, york h years
to make his move.

32:53.151 --> 32:55.552
He's a cattleman.
He's got plenty of money.

32:55.587 --> 32:58.288
Why would he come out
of the woodwork now?

32:58.323 --> 33:01.024
I am tellingou,
this is not about the past.

33:01.059 --> 33:03.360
-This is about the present.
-Who cares?

33:03.394 --> 33:06.563
(chuckles)
just go to the walkers and see
if they'll beat his price.

33:06.598 --> 33:09.466
Are you kidding?
They would laugh in my face.

33:09.501 --> 33:13.370
All right, well, fine. At least
you could say you asked.

33:13.404 --> 33:15.639
Holly, make this uale
before york wakes up

33:15.673 --> 33:17.209
And realizes
he's throwing his money away.

33:17.209 --> 33:20.429
But what if he's not? What
if he's getting the bargain?

33:20.429 --> 33:23.560
All right, now you lost me.
I think that york knows something

33:23.560 --> 33:25.723
About the value
of ojai that I don't.

33:25.723 --> 33:27.192
Do you have any evidence
of that?

33:27.192 --> 33:29.227
Because you know ojai
better than anybody.

33:30.257 --> 33:31.879
Maybe I don't.

33:31.879 --> 33:36.312
(sizzling)

33:37.597 --> 33:41.999
I don't know how many
lemons and oranges--

33:42.033 --> 33:42.591
They all fell to the ground.

33:42.591 --> 33:46.390
But she took one lemon
and a little wire and put it in

33:46.390 --> 33:48.510
And this one little light
just lit up.

33:48.510 --> 33:53.162
Oh, I wish I could have seen it.
She was great, really, really great.

33:54.121 --> 33:55.036
Nora...

33:56.026 --> 33:58.076
I'm glad you wanted to see me.

34:00.219 --> 34:02.098
Well, I was thinking and...

34:03.264 --> 34:06.606
From... My experience,

34:06.606 --> 34:09.201
What we have together is rare.

34:09.201 --> 34:10.659
I think so, too.

34:10.659 --> 34:14.801
So I would like to try again,
if you want that.

34:16.641 --> 34:17.692
I do.

34:17.692 --> 34:19.663
I do.

34:20.764 --> 34:23.674
I'm sorry you have to
leave town again. Tomorrow?

34:23.708 --> 34:25.242
Yes, yes.

34:25.275 --> 34:28.145
I've been putting off meeting
with this donor for a while.

34:28.179 --> 34:29.913
And I...

34:32.283 --> 34:35.252
What time does your plane leave
tomorrow?

34:35.286 --> 34:36.987
6:00.

34:37.021 --> 34:39.989
Why don't you come over
for lunch?

34:40.024 --> 34:42.192
I would love that.

34:42.226 --> 34:45.429
Nora, you won't regret this.
I promise you.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.799
No, I know I won't.

34:56.605 --> 34:57.835
Hey, you slept in.

34:57.835 --> 34:59.352
I was tired.

34:59.352 --> 35:02.866
I used to dream that you would
sleep past 7:00.

35:02.866 --> 35:04.346
-Here you go.
-Dreams come true.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.034
I'm so proud of you, honey.

35:06.034 --> 35:09.046
Honorable mention--
that's a very big deal.

35:09.046 --> 35:12.450
I'm just glad alex's brain thing
won instead of henry's.

35:12.450 --> 35:15.794
Do you remember last year when
we made that maze together

35:15.794 --> 35:17.578
And you trained the little rat
to run through it?

35:17.578 --> 35:19.627
His name was ratmandoo,
and you hated him.

35:19.627 --> 35:21.691
I did not hate ratmandoo.
I just didn't like

35:21.691 --> 35:23.556
His slimy little tail
and the way he... (mutters)

35:24.967 --> 35:26.409
Okay, I hated him.

35:26.409 --> 35:29.813
But I really loved working
on that together with you.

35:31.130 --> 35:34.742
I know you think I can't do
anything without your help,

35:35.528 --> 35:36.110
But I can.

35:36.110 --> 35:37.089
I know.

35:38.164 --> 35:40.750
Paige, it's not that
I don't trust you.

35:40.750 --> 35:43.494
I guess it's nice to know
that you need me,

35:43.494 --> 35:45.579
And I miss that sometimes.

35:45.579 --> 35:48.049
I still can't drive and stuff.

35:48.049 --> 35:50.135
(chuckles) great.

35:51.299 --> 35:54.908
Paige, you are
such a smart and capable

35:54.908 --> 35:56.575
And mature young lady.

35:56.575 --> 35:58.755
I'm sorry
if I got in your way.

35:59.717 --> 36:01.387
(telephone rings)

36:01.387 --> 36:04.075
(ring)

36:04.075 --> 36:06.824
It's kaya. Can I take it?

36:06.824 --> 36:07.951
(ring)
yeah, go ahead.

36:07.951 --> 36:08.912
(beep)

36:08.912 --> 36:10.587
Hey. Hold on a sec.

36:13.879 --> 36:14.477
Thanks, mom.

36:14.477 --> 36:15.609
You betcha.

36:15.609 --> 36:19.059
I know.
Can you believhe did that?

36:19.059 --> 36:19.923
He's such a loser.

36:21.591 --> 36:24.106
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.
It's a doctor's appointment.

36:24.106 --> 36:25.921
No matter how late you are,
they still keep you waiting.

36:25.921 --> 36:27.760
That's because everyone
thinks that.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.717
If people actually showed up
on time, it would work.

36:29.717 --> 36:31.318
Kevin, stop worrying.
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:31.318 --> 36:33.648
I'm not worried. I'm--I-I know
what she's gonna say--

36:33.648 --> 36:36.229
We should implant two embryos,
and they should both be yours.

36:36.229 --> 36:39.097
Well, it's not her decision
to make.(keys jangle)

36:39.097 --> 36:40.629
(sighs)

36:41.742 --> 36:44.448
I almost cost paige
her honorable mention yesterday

36:44.448 --> 36:45.957
Because I wanted her
to come in first.

36:45.957 --> 36:47.126
Her idea was perfect.

36:47.126 --> 36:50.310
-I tried to make it better with a disco ball.
-Actually, I liked that part.

36:50.310 --> 36:53.803
(sighs)

36:55.746 --> 36:59.243
You know what I should have done?
I should have left her alone.

36:59.243 --> 37:03.151
And, of course,
I would love the chance

37:03.151 --> 37:04.465
To be thbiological father,

37:04.465 --> 37:05.881
But that's not gonna make me
a better dad.

37:07.058 --> 37:11.015
What would make me a better dad
is knowing it's not about me.

37:12.322 --> 37:14.729
Well, you know, it also means
that no matter what,

37:14.729 --> 37:17.944
're in this tother...
(clears throat)

37:17.944 --> 37:23.402
Which is why I want to use
one of yours and one of mine.

37:23.402 --> 37:26.299
No, it's too much of a risk.
Biology isn't fair.

37:26.299 --> 37:28.360
That doesn't mean
that we can't be.

37:31.593 --> 37:33.156
Really?

37:38.279 --> 37:38.762
Wow.

37:49.774 --> 37:50.232
Okay.

37:52.567 --> 37:55.018
Nora, you--you didn't have
to do all this.

37:55.018 --> 37:57.496
(laughs) well,
I tried to be festive.

37:58.797 --> 37:59.930
That's what I love about you.

38:00.330 --> 38:02.386
You make everything special.

38:02.386 --> 38:03.694
(door closes)
I try.

38:03.694 --> 38:07.127
-(sarah) mom!
-Uh, we're in here, sweetie.

38:07.127 --> 38:09.734
I just wanted to apologize for the...

38:12.265 --> 38:13.390
Simon.

38:13.702 --> 38:14.610
Hey, sarah.

38:15.578 --> 38:17.695
I didn't realize.
I'm sorry, mom. I'll come back.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.240
Oh, no, sweetie. Don't go.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.306
We're just having lunch
before simon leaves town.

38:22.306 --> 38:25.027
Go on. Have a sandwich.
(chuckles)

38:25.027 --> 38:28.208
My daughter worries about me.
It's silly.

38:28.208 --> 38:31.119
All my kids--they worry
about their old mom.

38:31.119 --> 38:33.270
I think it's sweet.
It shows they care.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.967
Although,
you did disappear.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.064
But like I told her,

38:37.064 --> 38:39.048
You had a perfectly reasonable
explanation.

38:39.048 --> 38:41.770
Well, it wasn't reasonable.
It was crazy.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.359
But crazy things happen.

38:43.359 --> 38:45.962
Hmm.
Simon had bone-break fever.

38:45.962 --> 38:47.636
Wow. That sounds horrible.

38:47.636 --> 38:50.959
Yes, it was. You should have
stayed in boca raton.

38:50.959 --> 38:52.405
(sarah) boca?

38:52.405 --> 38:56.470
Yes, he had too there before
he went down into the jungle.

38:56.470 --> 38:57.543
Isn't that what you said?

38:57.543 --> 39:00.090
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, let's get back to boca.

39:00.090 --> 39:02.734
My friends who winter there
say it's lovely.

39:02.734 --> 39:06.204
-Do you know marilyn weisman?
-Marilyn weisman?

39:06.204 --> 39:09.596
Actually, I didn't know marilyn
until yesterday.

39:09.596 --> 39:12.328
How about you, simon?

39:12.328 --> 39:14.544
Sure.

39:14.544 --> 39:15.559
Uh, we've met.

39:15.559 --> 39:19.717
Ah. Well, I was talking to
marilyn on the phone yesterday,

39:19.717 --> 39:21.995
And guess what, sarah.

39:21.995 --> 39:23.289
Her daughter rachel

39:23.289 --> 39:25.809
Is the public defender
in orange county,

39:25.809 --> 39:27.526
And she went to law school with kevin.
No.

39:27.526 --> 39:30.509
Yes.
Oh, wow. What a small world.

39:30.509 --> 39:33.679
Yes, isn't it? (laughs)
and the funny thing is,

39:33.679 --> 39:35.648
She says she knows you
very well.

39:35.648 --> 39:37.215
Nora, whatever she said--

39:37.215 --> 39:40.674
And the two of you were
quite serious with each other,

39:40.674 --> 39:43.271
For a brief time
not too long ago.

39:43.271 --> 39:43.892
Just friends.

39:43.892 --> 39:47.224
Friends?
Or is she another investor?

39:47.224 --> 39:50.550
Ooh. The plot thickens.

39:50.550 --> 39:55.625
You are both very photogenic, might I add.
Maybe I should go.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.474
<i>Sit.</i>

39:59.353 --> 40:03.189
Marilyn invested
a very large sum of money

40:03.189 --> 40:05.051
In one of simon's causes

40:05.051 --> 40:07.876
And then woke up to an empty bed
and a big, empty bank account.
No.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.197
Nora, you're not
gonna believe this--

40:11.197 --> 40:12.352
You're right.
I don't believe it.

40:12.352 --> 40:16.211
You're a liar,
and somehow I didn't see it,

40:16.211 --> 40:18.838
Which is crazy, because I was
married to one for 40 years.

40:18.838 --> 40:21.719
(doorbell rings twice)

40:21.719 --> 40:25.014
Ooh. That's not marilyn weisman,is it, mom?
No, I don't think so.

40:25.014 --> 40:26.878
I think that's probably
detective tanner.

40:28.338 --> 40:30.076
You--you called the police?

40:30.076 --> 40:31.158
Marilyn did.

40:31.158 --> 40:34.725
Gosh, I'm so sorry about
those charges she's filed.

40:34.725 --> 40:36.408
(doorbell rings twice)

40:36.408 --> 40:39.106
Nora. Nora. Please--

40:39.106 --> 40:41.530
I really wouldn't keep
detective tanner waiting

40:41.530 --> 40:42.229
If I were you.

40:42.229 --> 40:43.034
Take a sandwich.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.244
(door opens and closes)

40:55.244 --> 40:56.416
(laughs) god.

40:56.416 --> 40:59.000
Mom, that was like--
that was incredible.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.457
You were like a bond girl.

41:00.457 --> 41:02.472
Not a bond girl.

41:02.472 --> 41:05.140
I was like bond,
not his girl.

41:05.140 --> 41:07.583
Nora, I was terrified
back there.
Aah!

41:07.583 --> 41:09.461
There's the bond girl.

41:09.461 --> 41:12.255
I called saul to come here
in case there was trouble.

41:12.255 --> 41:14.489
I had my finger
onhe alarm's panic button

41:14.489 --> 41:18.112
The whole time I was there.
(laughs)
mom, I am in awe of you.

41:18.112 --> 41:20.381
Well, sarah, you're not the only
one who knows how to google.

41:20.381 --> 41:21.687
You okay, sweetheart?

41:21.687 --> 41:25.911
Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
It was very satisfying.

41:25.911 --> 41:27.584
Saul, pass me my phone.
Who are you calling?

41:27.584 --> 41:29.316
Kitty. Come on.
Okay.

41:29.316 --> 41:30.774
This is the stuff
that legends are made of.
(laughs)

41:30.774 --> 41:34.355
Kit, it's sarah.
Listen, um, press conference.

41:34.355 --> 41:36.910
I'll wait while you get
everybody.

41:36.910 --> 41:37.520
(saul and sarah laugh)

41:37.520 --> 41:41.304
