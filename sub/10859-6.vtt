08:40.548 --> 08:43.308
We really don't want to kill you...
sir.

08:43.308 --> 08:46.668
So, mate, with fuel injection,
it's rather like osmosis -

08:46.668 --> 08:50.308
a solvent passes through
a semi-permeable membrane
to form an equilibrium. Yes?

08:54.828 --> 08:58.068
Put your weapon down, Becker,
and surrender the artefact.

08:58.068 --> 09:01.308
With respect, I don't take orders
from you.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.948
You do now.

09:06.668 --> 09:08.868
Danny, I hope you know
what you're doing.

09:17.508 --> 09:20.268
The Minister isn't in?
Did you tell him it was me?

09:20.268 --> 09:23.828
I'm afraid he won't be taking
your call, James.

09:23.828 --> 09:25.788
You've been a bad boy!

09:31.090 --> 09:34.610
They're still on our tail, Danny.
Danny, what are we going to do?

09:39.290 --> 09:41.810
Hold on tight.
This could get a bit lively.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.410
Danny?

10:01.570 --> 10:05.370
Stay in line. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.330
Keep it moving!

10:09.650 --> 10:12.090
Sorry, ma'am... They got away.

10:12.090 --> 10:14.770
Well, don't just stand there.
Find them.

10:19.930 --> 10:22.930
Tell me where they've gone.
No idea.

10:22.930 --> 10:26.370
You know what freelance staff are
like - always popping in and out.

10:26.370 --> 10:29.490
You can't protect them for long.

10:29.490 --> 10:33.090
The truth is, you can't do much of
anything any more.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.850
Oh, and you're in my chair!

10:48.370 --> 10:50.370
You know, this isn't over, Christine.

10:50.370 --> 10:54.010
When people say that, James,...
it usually is.

10:59.650 --> 11:03.450
Ladies and gentlemen, James Lester
has been relieved of his duties.

11:06.170 --> 11:10.770
Please continue working normally and
this transition will run smoothly.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.570
The ARC.

11:37.570 --> 11:40.330
At least we know where we're going.
Get rid of your mobiles.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.850
I've just signed
a new 18-month contract.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.850
They can trace it.

11:51.690 --> 11:54.330
You do realise this isn't personal,
Captain?

11:54.330 --> 11:56.490
It's purely a question of
national security.

11:56.490 --> 11:57.970
Of course, ma'am.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.930
I've looked at your file, Becker.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.690
You're a good soldier.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.770
I am your commanding officer now.

12:07.730 --> 12:10.170
I assume
there is no conflict of loyalties?

12:10.170 --> 12:11.570
None at all.

12:11.570 --> 12:17.290
Find me the artefact...and you're
looking at a very rapid promotion.

12:17.290 --> 12:19.370
I'll do my best.

12:24.930 --> 12:28.130
I'll raise you 300.
Pass.

12:28.130 --> 12:31.210
Don't want to play with
the big boys? I'm out as well.

12:36.050 --> 12:39.050
Cool lizard.
What? Oh yeah, very rare.

12:40.930 --> 12:44.050
Just like this hand. I'm all in.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.570
I call.

12:53.210 --> 12:56.730
Something tells me this safe house
hasn't been used for years.

12:56.730 --> 12:59.570
Thanks a lot, Lester.
This place looks terrific (!)

13:44.570 --> 13:47.530
It was never going to be a four-star
hotel, was it?

13:54.970 --> 13:56.770
Is it locked?
Yeah.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.250
Leave this to me.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.650
The only part of being a copper
I enjoyed.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.290
Come on.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.290
Wow!

14:39.290 --> 14:40.850
Urgh...

14:50.890 --> 14:53.690
Chateau Lafite. Not a bad vintage.
Why, is that worth much?

14:53.690 --> 14:55.890
About Â£1,000.

14:59.610 --> 15:03.090
There's no power.

15:03.090 --> 15:05.450
It'll be like Christmas
at my gran's. (LAUGHS)

15:05.450 --> 15:08.490
Please, God,
nobody mention charades!

15:08.490 --> 15:11.210
I'm going to get some wood
for the fire.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.810
Argh!

15:38.810 --> 15:40.770
That hurt.

15:54.890 --> 15:57.210
Huh! Oh, no!

15:57.210 --> 15:59.410
That's just wrong!

16:11.250 --> 16:14.090
This trip wire will act as
an early-warning system.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.650
How long do you reckon
we should wait here?

16:20.650 --> 16:22.610
As long as it takes.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.050
We haven't got any food.

16:28.050 --> 16:31.530
Oh, er...found them in the car.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.730
They're going to find us,
aren't they?

16:33.730 --> 16:35.690
It's just a matter of time.

16:36.770 --> 16:39.770
But we're not going to give up
without a fight, are we, eh?

16:40.850 --> 16:42.730
No.
Come on.

16:53.650 --> 16:57.130
It's like they thought they were
coming back at any minute.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.450
Oh...

17:16.490 --> 17:19.089
Right, let's see if you still work.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.290
Hey.
Probably past its sell-by date.

17:28.930 --> 17:33.290
Brilliant. Corned beef. I love it.
Corned beef...

17:33.290 --> 17:34.250
Abby!

17:40.410 --> 17:42.330
Aren't they beautiful!
Wow!

17:48.690 --> 17:50.090
Whoa!

18:07.130 --> 18:09.210
Hello, hello, this is Connor Temple.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.650
Is anybody receiving me? Over.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.210
Hello?

18:21.770 --> 18:23.570
Hm...

18:45.890 --> 18:48.810
Get it off me!
What are you doing?

18:48.810 --> 18:50.290
Argh! Huh!

18:50.290 --> 18:54.410
Urgh!

18:54.410 --> 18:58.690
What? I just opened the door
and it fell out on me.

18:58.690 --> 19:01.210
He must have got trapped inside.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.570
It looks like
some sort of viewing room.

19:10.890 --> 19:12.810
It's a diary.

19:12.810 --> 19:15.370
It's written in some sort of code.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.970
Can you crack it?
Of course I can.

19:19.970 --> 19:22.290
What happened here?
Where did they all go?

19:29.810 --> 19:33.250
You're cleaned out, Jackie!
Come on!

19:33.250 --> 19:36.490
One of you can afford to sub me.
Sorry, mate.

19:43.410 --> 19:45.770
I'll bet the lizard against
whatever you've got.

19:45.770 --> 19:47.450
It's worth a fortune. Abby told me.

19:54.210 --> 19:56.290
All right. The lizard.

19:56.290 --> 20:00.610
# When the little bluebird
who has never said a word

20:00.610 --> 20:02.850
# Starts to sing "Spring! Spring!"

20:04.050 --> 20:06.810
# And the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell

20:06.810 --> 20:09.890
# Starts to ring "Ding! Ding!"...

20:09.890 --> 20:11.850
Abby?

20:13.570 --> 20:16.970
# Sings a tune to the moon above

20:16.970 --> 20:21.170
# It is nature, that's all,
simply telling us to fall in love

20:23.530 --> 20:29.090
# In old Amsterdam...

20:35.210 --> 20:37.250
# Argentines, without...

20:42.570 --> 20:44.570
Guys, listen to this.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.130
"There's no-one left.

20:47.130 --> 20:49.450
The others are all dead.

20:49.450 --> 20:51.810
God help me, it's happening again.

20:51.810 --> 20:54.450
They're here."

20:54.450 --> 20:56.890
And that's where it ends.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.650
Who's here?

21:00.530 --> 21:03.610
It's an anomaly!

21:03.610 --> 21:06.370
Does Quinn have access to
a detector?

21:06.370 --> 21:08.730
No. There's no way they can know
about the anomaly.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.810
Then my men can cover it.
You stay here.

21:12.450 --> 21:15.290
It was written by
a Professor John Morton.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.130
He was a military scientist

21:17.130 --> 21:20.650
who came here with his team to do
meteorological tests,

21:20.650 --> 21:23.090
but then something happened.

21:23.090 --> 21:26.650
They found something in the woods,
but Morton doesn't say what.

21:37.850 --> 21:40.370
That sounds like some kind of
bird's distress call.

21:40.370 --> 21:42.970
But what type of bird
would make that sound?

21:42.970 --> 21:44.890
I don't know.

21:46.970 --> 21:48.930
It's the trip wire.
Have they found us?

21:48.930 --> 21:51.330
Get them out the back!
Come on, let's go.

21:51.330 --> 21:53.250
I'll catch you up.
Abby. Go!

22:02.370 --> 22:04.210
Hide in the bunker.

22:07.330 --> 22:09.770
An anomaly.
Let's get to the car.

22:24.530 --> 22:25.610
Danny! Run!

22:30.330 --> 22:33.090
That Lafite was worth
Â£1,000 a a bottle!

22:33.090 --> 22:36.210
I think it was corked anyway.
Forget that. Get to the car!

22:36.210 --> 22:37.650
OK, OK.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.810
Get in the car!
Get in the car, it's a creature!

22:47.730 --> 22:49.610
Come on!

22:52.410 --> 22:54.370
Go go go go!

23:11.010 --> 23:13.210
Where's it gone?

23:19.050 --> 23:21.730
Look out!

23:26.170 --> 23:28.570
Are you OK?
Yeah.

23:30.890 --> 23:33.090
I can't see him.

23:46.010 --> 23:48.530
Connor, drive faster!
Put your foot down!

23:54.130 --> 23:56.490
Brace yourselves!

24:16.210 --> 24:17.410
Oh, my god,
I think I've killed Danny!

24:26.250 --> 24:28.010
Danny!
Danny!

24:38.890 --> 24:41.690
Whoo!
Yes! Whoo hoo!

24:44.330 --> 24:47.050
Well done, mate!

25:02.314 --> 25:04.674
Are you all right?
I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK.

25:04.674 --> 25:06.514
Good girl.
Connor...

25:06.514 --> 25:09.474
Connor.
Are you all right, Connor?

25:09.474 --> 25:11.074
Put your back against there.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.354
Are you all right?
Yeah.

25:13.354 --> 25:16.554
Connor, speak to me.
DISTANT WAIL

25:16.554 --> 25:20.194
It's coming back... Abby. Abby!

25:20.194 --> 25:22.194
What?
Listen to me. Listen.

25:22.194 --> 25:24.274
We can never outrun it. OK?

25:24.274 --> 25:27.474
You two get back to the lodge.
It's the only place we might be safe.

25:27.474 --> 25:29.594
I'll look after him, I promise.
All right?

25:29.594 --> 25:30.994
Now go! Go go!

25:30.994 --> 25:32.954
Connor!
Come on!

25:47.594 --> 25:51.674
Over there. Check it out.
I'll secure the area.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.954
Ow!

26:20.874 --> 26:22.874
Close the door quietly.

26:24.434 --> 26:27.234
(Where are you?)
I'm up here.

26:29.554 --> 26:32.954
What are you doing up there?
What do you think I'm doing up here?

26:32.954 --> 26:38.154
I don't know. Kind of why I asked.
Where's the bird?

26:39.834 --> 26:43.274
Close-ish. So keep your voice down.

26:43.274 --> 26:45.874
Sorry.

26:45.874 --> 26:47.954
What are we going to do?

26:47.954 --> 26:50.594
We're going to trap it.
Brilliant.

26:51.954 --> 26:55.034
How are we going to do that?

26:55.034 --> 26:58.114
Cool.

26:58.114 --> 27:02.514
So what do you want ME to do?
Just stay down there and look tasty.

27:02.514 --> 27:04.594
You what?

27:06.994 --> 27:08.794
You're the bait.

27:11.634 --> 27:13.794
I know it's this way.

27:13.794 --> 27:15.074
Urgh!

27:15.074 --> 27:19.314
Great for dancing.
Not so good for cross-country.

27:29.794 --> 27:32.874
Are you sure this is going to work?
How can it fail?

27:32.874 --> 27:35.394
Only in about 100 different ways.

27:35.394 --> 27:39.834
Come on. Where are you?

27:39.834 --> 27:45.714
Maybe, maybe we scared it away.
Maybe...maybe it's just frightened.

27:49.514 --> 27:52.114
Not frightened enough.
Get back in the car.

27:52.114 --> 27:54.354
Get back in the car!

28:30.874 --> 28:33.114
Come on, come on!
Danny!

28:33.114 --> 28:34.874
Come on, come on!

28:42.994 --> 28:47.874
Connor! Get out of there!
OK, I'm getting out!

29:00.434 --> 29:03.234
There's more of them.

29:09.034 --> 29:11.034
Quick, hide!

29:33.634 --> 29:35.914
I think they've gone.

29:46.594 --> 29:48.794
Oh, my god!

29:48.794 --> 29:50.394
ROARS

29:50.394 --> 29:51.874
Run!

30:03.194 --> 30:05.554
What?
Look.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.594
Watch where you put your feet.
Good advice... Thanks.

30:13.434 --> 30:16.394
Watch out! Look out!

30:16.394 --> 30:20.874
Danny!
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

30:20.874 --> 30:24.514
It's a minefield.

30:24.514 --> 30:26.994
How was your hopscotch at school?
Pretty good.

30:26.994 --> 30:29.274
Come on! Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

30:29.274 --> 30:31.594
Watch out!

30:31.594 --> 30:34.794
Come on!
Quick, girls, please, quickly!

30:35.794 --> 30:37.754
Give me your hand!
Let's go!

30:40.674 --> 30:42.154
Go to the lodge!

31:05.034 --> 31:07.274
Stay where you are,
you're under arrest!

31:11.314 --> 31:13.154
What was the explosion?
A creature.

31:13.154 --> 31:15.914
Get us out of here!
Mate, there is more of them.

31:15.914 --> 31:18.354
All in good time.
Trust me, we need to hurry.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.634
Shut up!

31:23.794 --> 31:26.314
What are you looking at?

31:35.194 --> 31:37.074
Connor!

31:55.754 --> 31:57.674
Connor!
Abby, come on!

32:12.674 --> 32:14.994
Danny.
All right.

32:22.154 --> 32:24.474
What happened?
Where's the artefact?

32:24.474 --> 32:27.234
Let me handle this.
I know how Quinn's mind works.

32:28.234 --> 32:30.314
Fine. Do it.

32:30.314 --> 32:32.314
Shouldn't we report this
to the Minister?

32:32.314 --> 32:34.914
Lester kept him informed
on operational decisions.

32:34.914 --> 32:37.994
Let ME worry about him. He'll find
out what I choose to tell him.

32:37.994 --> 32:41.234
With respect, ma'am, if he discovers
he's not being fully informed...

32:41.234 --> 32:44.754
The Minister is an imbecile.
He can barely blow his own nose.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.234
Do you think I'm going to let
a Whitehall glove puppet

32:47.234 --> 32:50.194
with the IQ of a root vegetable
tell me how to do my job?

32:50.194 --> 32:52.394
Now find Quinn for me.

32:58.274 --> 33:02.634
You never know, maybe the explosions
just scared them all off.

33:02.634 --> 33:05.074
More likely they'll be gathering
somewhere

33:05.074 --> 33:08.754
like hyenas preparing to steal
a kill.

33:13.274 --> 33:17.554
Looks like tea break's over.

33:31.514 --> 33:33.634
Abby, are you all right?
Yeah.

33:40.474 --> 33:43.234
Go. Go!!

33:44.994 --> 33:46.954
Block this up!

33:49.874 --> 33:54.394
Ready?
Yeah.

33:54.394 --> 33:56.914
Again!

34:02.034 --> 34:03.554
Go!

34:08.074 --> 34:10.634
Danny!

34:12.674 --> 34:14.514
Abby!

34:15.873 --> 34:17.353
Sarah!

34:48.994 --> 34:50.954
Connor!

34:53.994 --> 34:55.634
Connor!
I can't hold this!

35:31.994 --> 35:33.874
Connor, talk to me.

35:33.874 --> 35:36.474
I don't know where they've gone!

35:58.194 --> 36:00.434
Go! Go go!
Use the wardrobe! Block it up!

36:10.354 --> 36:12.594
I've got to go back in that room.

36:12.594 --> 36:14.354
You're kidding!
No.

36:14.354 --> 36:17.274
The record! It's our only chance!

36:26.994 --> 36:29.754
What are you doing?
I've got an idea.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.194
I've got to get to the bunker.

36:39.914 --> 36:41.474
Connor!

37:21.594 --> 37:23.514
Connor!

37:24.354 --> 37:26.674
Connor! Do something!

37:34.594 --> 37:36.954
I can't hold them off!

37:39.274 --> 37:42.114
Hey! Over here!

37:44.114 --> 37:45.474
Over here!

37:45.474 --> 37:47.274
I'm so much more tastier than him!

37:49.834 --> 37:52.314
Connor!
Come over here, it's dinnertime!

37:53.834 --> 37:56.754
Huh?

37:58.914 --> 38:01.154
Connor!
Argh! Argh!

38:01.154 --> 38:04.194
Aargh! Urgh!

38:04.194 --> 38:05.474
Connor!
Aargh!

38:49.981 --> 38:51.901
Let's attract your attention, boys.

38:53.541 --> 38:56.141
Yes!

39:23.741 --> 39:25.221
Sarah!

39:26.901 --> 39:29.181
Connor!
All right?

39:32.901 --> 39:34.661
Quickly! Quickly!

39:40.421 --> 39:43.581
Where's Abby?
She's on the roof. What?

39:43.581 --> 39:46.061
Sarah!

39:46.061 --> 39:48.181
I'm slipping!

40:19.621 --> 40:22.621
Come on, boys!

40:29.301 --> 40:31.261
Time to go home.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.541
Danny.

41:10.981 --> 41:13.781
Anyone got a belt?
These trousers are a nightmare.

41:17.701 --> 41:19.741
Oh! I wouldn't have bothered.

41:19.741 --> 41:23.181
Good idea to use that record
to attract the birds.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.501
I'm just chuffed
you care so much, Connor.

41:25.901 --> 41:28.101
What?

41:28.101 --> 41:30.141
You're all under arrest.

41:32.021 --> 41:33.981
Oh, you've got to be joking!

41:34.741 --> 41:37.141
My orders are to take you
back to the ARC.

41:37.141 --> 41:40.301
I'm authorised to use deadly force
if I have to.

41:40.301 --> 41:43.461
You're Johnson's man now?
I'm just following orders.

41:43.461 --> 41:47.021
Like a good little soldier boy.
Where's the artefact?

41:49.141 --> 41:53.221
Excellent work, Captain. I can see
you're a man with real potential.

41:53.221 --> 41:56.141
Very kind, madam.
I think I'm going to be sick!

41:56.141 --> 41:58.541
I'd have a little more respect
if I were you, Quinn.

41:58.541 --> 42:02.341
You're looking at a serious charge
of stealing government property.

42:03.661 --> 42:05.181
Hello, Christine.

42:05.181 --> 42:07.861
You're not authorised to enter
this facility, James.

42:07.861 --> 42:09.541
I think you're sitting in my chair.

42:09.541 --> 42:14.541
Captain, would you escort this
troublesome man from the building?

42:14.541 --> 42:16.741
I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am.
What?

42:20.821 --> 42:24.181
'The Minister is an imbecile.
He can barely blow his own nose.

42:24.181 --> 42:27.101
Do you really think I'm going to let
a Whitehall glove puppet

42:27.101 --> 42:30.261
with the IQ of a root vegetable
tell me how to do my job?'

42:30.261 --> 42:33.661
Yes, Captain Becker recorded it
and I sent a copy to Whitehall.

42:33.661 --> 42:37.301
Oh, that reminds me,
the Minister wants to see you.

42:37.301 --> 42:39.341
Actually, he did seem a little upset.

42:40.941 --> 42:43.821
Christine, I did tell you
it wasn't over.

42:43.821 --> 42:46.221
No, James...

42:46.221 --> 42:48.181
I assure you it's not.

43:02.221 --> 43:04.101
You are my hero.

43:04.101 --> 43:07.021
And mine.
But don't expect any kisses from me.

43:10.261 --> 43:12.221
Haven't you all got work to do?

43:14.021 --> 43:15.821
Sorry, mate, I was out of order.

43:15.821 --> 43:19.421
No problem. Just don't call me
"soldier boy" again. Sorry!

43:23.301 --> 43:25.941
You missed us, didn't you?
Don't be ridiculous.

43:53.421 --> 43:58.861
# Somewhere over the rainbow

44:00.261 --> 44:02.381
# Way up high

44:04.741 --> 44:10.141
# In the dreams
that you dream of

44:10.141 --> 44:15.901
# Once in a lullaby

44:15.901 --> 44:18.781
# Oh

44:18.781 --> 44:24.141
# Somewhere over the rainbow

44:25.741 --> 44:27.701
# Bluebirds fly... #

44:29.741 --> 44:31.741
All right?
Not bad.

44:31.741 --> 44:36.381
What happened to you? Oh, just
another boring day at the office.

44:36.381 --> 44:39.301
Have you been having a party?
Oh, just a few friends.

44:39.301 --> 44:41.501
I'll clean up in a bit.
Yeah, you will.

44:47.861 --> 44:50.461
Where's Rex?
Up in my room.

44:50.461 --> 44:52.821
OK. Cool.

44:58.701 --> 45:03.421
We've had a dragon,
a knight in shining armour...
A damsel in distress would be nice.

45:03.421 --> 45:06.541
Explain to me why Rex is up
for auction on the internet?

45:06.541 --> 45:08.781
Gambling and poker.
Get him back!

45:08.781 --> 45:11.781
We have to find him.
He's lost in an unknown world.

45:11.781 --> 45:14.021
The mark of the beast.
Sling your 'ook!

45:14.021 --> 45:16.141
Take it outside!

45:23.221 --> 45:25.741
You are demons.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.621
And I am in hell.
