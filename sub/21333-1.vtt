<i>I am you.</i>

00:58.250 --> 01:00.833
<i>I'd like to feel what you feel...</i>

01:02.167 --> 01:04.125
<i>think what you think.</i>

01:04.208 --> 01:06.708
<i>I want to suck</i>
<i>every part of your body.</i>

01:06.792 --> 01:08.083
<i>Nothing about you disgusts me.</i>

01:08.167 --> 01:09.917
<i>- Recently...</i>
<i>- There are moments...</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:13.292
<i>- ...I dreamed I was inside you.</i>
<i>- When I want to stop being me...</i>

01:13.375 --> 01:17.375
<i>- I could feel inside you.</i>
<i>- So I can be you.</i>

01:17.458 --> 01:18.792
<i>You are me.</i>

01:18.875 --> 01:20.208
<i>I am you.</i>

01:34.583 --> 01:36.792
I love breathing you.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.583
So do I.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.667
When will I get my gift?

02:08.833 --> 02:10.125
What gift?

02:10.708 --> 02:12.875
The one you have hidden there.

02:14.042 --> 02:15.917
I don't know what you mean.

02:16.542 --> 02:19.125
- Yes, you do.
- No.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.667
- Yes.
- I've got no idea.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.417
Yes, you do.

02:26.375 --> 02:27.958
Give it to me!

02:29.958 --> 02:31.083
No!

02:31.167 --> 02:32.458
Give it to me!

02:35.167 --> 02:36.333
Stop!

02:45.083 --> 02:46.500
Don't open it yet!

02:55.583 --> 02:58.250
- I'll kill you!
- You're an idiot!

03:01.167 --> 03:02.167
No!

03:02.250 --> 03:03.500
Don't open it.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.917
Are you sure you want to do it?

03:29.583 --> 03:31.625
Yes. Aren't you?

03:35.875 --> 03:37.417
I'm surprised.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.458
I didn't think you were serious.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.500
You said it too.

03:46.417 --> 03:47.417
Yes.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.333
- Forget it.
- No, wait.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.833
Are you sure?
It's very romantic.

04:01.667 --> 04:02.792
Forget it.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.583
Are you sure or not?

04:08.375 --> 04:09.542
I think so.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.583
Yes?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.333
Yes.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.750
It's over,
don't think about it anymore.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.625
What are you doing?

05:20.375 --> 05:21.708
Undress.

05:30.583 --> 05:31.917
Are you sure?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.917
What's wrong?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.583
Are you backing out?

05:41.083 --> 05:43.125
No, I'll do it.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.708
Undress.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.500
I love you.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.542
And I love you.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.667
Don't force it. Relax.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.125
Bye, love!

07:56.958 --> 07:58.417
Stop it.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.125
- Be quiet.
- Get off.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.625
- Mom?
- No, love, it's your aunt.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.958
I forgot some papers,
but I'm going now.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.333
'Bye.

10:05.917 --> 10:11.750
LOVING

10:11.833 --> 10:14.500
- He's taking so long.
- Stay another day.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.583
No, I'm sleeping at home
even if it's on a scaffold.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.167
- I told Pablo already.
- It isn't so bad here.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.125
- Or so good.
- That's gratitude!

10:24.250 --> 10:27.708
- And it'll stink of paint.
- I love the smell of paint.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.333
Laura, will you show us
a photo of Carlos?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.625
- You want to see Carlos?
- Yes, I do.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.208
- And so does your mother.
- Of course.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.000
Look.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.750
He's gorgeous!

10:42.500 --> 10:44.333
That's at his grandma's birthday.

10:44.417 --> 10:45.583
And what's that?

10:45.667 --> 10:48.208
- A suckling pig. Isn't it like a cow?
- Yes!

10:48.292 --> 10:51.083
- Have you invited him on Saturday?
- Yes.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.750
- Are we going to meet him?
- Yes, we're so lucky.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.583
We want to go to an amazing place
that Carlos knows.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.292
Great. When?

10:58.917 --> 11:00.083
A weekend.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.667
- Who with?
- Carlos and me.

11:02.750 --> 11:06.542
Laura, we've been here three months
and all I hear about is Carlos.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.833
Why not meet up
with people from school?

11:08.917 --> 11:10.958
Or invite them on Saturday.
Call Juan.

11:11.542 --> 11:12.458
Juan?

11:12.542 --> 11:14.583
His mother says
he's coming for a few days.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.083
Who's Juan?

11:16.167 --> 11:18.250
- Her "friend" from the village.
- No.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.750
- Oh, no?
- What's this?

11:23.708 --> 11:25.750
- Look who's here.
- Great!

11:28.750 --> 11:32.375
- Well, are we all ready?
- Yes, please, take them away.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.750
You bitch.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.458
I don't like the view either.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.708
But painted like this,
it looks bigger, right, Merche?

11:58.792 --> 12:00.875
That's true, it does.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.750
- You see I painted the gray you liked?
- Yeah.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.542
It's turned out really well.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.583
- It's kind of rustic.
- Industrial style.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.292
Does it need a coat of something?

12:11.375 --> 12:13.250
- Maybe a varnish?
- Yeah, but...

12:13.333 --> 12:15.042
You've just seen each other!

12:22.250 --> 12:25.083
I'm so happy
to have your semen inside me.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.292
It's like you hadn't left.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.917
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why I couldn't control it.</i>

12:29.667 --> 12:33.250
<i>Hey, don't worry,</i>
<i>my period's due any day.</i>

12:34.708 --> 12:37.250
<i>- I am you.</i>
- And I am you.

12:40.042 --> 12:42.125
I can't talk.
I'll text you. Kisses.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.208
<i>I love you.</i>

12:44.000 --> 12:45.333
What is it, Dad?

12:45.417 --> 12:47.958
- How was yesterday with the faculty?
- Fine.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.125
Did you have Civil Law with Vazquez?

12:50.208 --> 12:52.333
No, his assistant came.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.250
Is there any concept
you find particularly difficult?

12:55.792 --> 12:56.917
No, it's fine.

13:01.292 --> 13:04.167
Remember to say hello to Vazquez
when you see him.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.500
Sure.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.750
The meat is wonderful.

13:27.583 --> 13:28.667
Thank you.

13:42.583 --> 13:43.917
APPRENTICE WANTED

13:50.500 --> 13:51.375
CLOCK SHOP

13:51.458 --> 13:52.458
Carlos!

14:00.667 --> 14:03.125
- You skipped class.
- It was rubbish.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.500
Laura! Laura.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.500
You left this on your desk.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.208
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:12.292 --> 14:13.583
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.583
- Why bring it to class?
- My mother searches through everything.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.208
Hey! I wanted it as a souvenir!

14:55.208 --> 14:57.000
'L' HAS A DICK

15:10.958 --> 15:12.083
Marta!

15:13.292 --> 15:15.167
- Can I have a word?
- What about?

15:15.250 --> 15:17.375
When you arrive somewhere
you say hello.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.833
Please.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.375
Remember the bag I left behind
and you returned to me?

15:33.458 --> 15:34.500
Yes.

15:35.417 --> 15:38.292
- Did you see what was inside?
- A box.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.917
- Did you look inside the box?
- No.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.417
- Are you sure?
- Why, what was it? Drugs?

15:45.333 --> 15:47.000
Hey, I didn't look!

15:47.083 --> 15:49.708
Before you took it,
was anyone else looking at it?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.750
Is the interrogation over?

16:04.583 --> 16:06.333
They're beautiful.

16:06.792 --> 16:11.458
Hey, the other day I saw online
that the fine arts tests are in June.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.875
Yes, but it isn't so easy.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.958
You have to go to an academy
and be well-prepared.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.875
Well, why not go to the academy
and get prepared?

16:22.375 --> 16:24.833
And if you're accepted,
then you can decide.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.333
Have you had your period yet?

16:34.292 --> 16:35.500
Not yet.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.458
Don't worry. Two more days.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.792
Don't joke.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.458
Well,

16:43.542 --> 16:47.125
- we'd save on condoms, wouldn't we?
- Don't joke about it.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.375
And what about this?

17:05.041 --> 17:06.375
What are you doing?

17:06.916 --> 17:08.291
Get off!

17:09.416 --> 17:10.916
Stop it! No!

17:34.417 --> 17:36.750
- I'll get it.
- Hello.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.583
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

17:38.667 --> 17:39.833
Sweetheart!

17:39.917 --> 17:41.875
- Hello, love.
- Hello! I'm Eloisa.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.667
- Hello.
- Hello, this is Ăngel.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.875
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.667
What have you done to your hair?
You look great.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.583
- I have to cut it.
- No way.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.875
Don't mention my hair
or my job interview.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.500
I can help you with that.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.208
I'm a hairdresser now!

17:56.292 --> 17:58.500
No, seriously, I know of a job
that might interest you.

17:58.583 --> 17:59.917
We'll talk about that later.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.292
Wow, the house is lovely!

18:04.375 --> 18:08.417
It still needs a few touches...
Some pictures on the walls...

18:08.500 --> 18:11.083
It looks great.
Happy birthday, love.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.333
- How is she doing?
- Ask her.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.917
Here's your gift, love.

18:18.083 --> 18:21.458
- Can I exchange it?
- The gift receipt is in the bag.

18:22.125 --> 18:25.000
You've changed so much.
You're all grown up.

18:25.083 --> 18:28.625
- Well, where's the famous boyfriend?
- That's enough.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.083
- He's a friend.
- Yes, sorry.

18:31.167 --> 18:33.000
The friend. Where is he?

18:33.083 --> 18:35.333
- Dad, don't say anything.
- I won't.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.333
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.583
It's the friend!
I'm the father-in-law.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.917
- I mean, the father.
- Don't listen to him.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.417
- I'll take those.
- No, they're not for you.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.500
- Are you Merche?
- Yes, her mother.

18:56.583 --> 18:59.125
- Hello. A pleasure.
- I'm Carlos.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.792
- Here, for you, for the new house.
- Liliums, my favorite.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.208
You know how to win over
the mother-in-law.

19:05.292 --> 19:08.667
I like him, Laura. He's polite.
You could learn from him.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.625
I'm Eloisa, her stepmother.

19:10.708 --> 19:13.042
- But a good one, a very good one.
- Nice to meet you.

19:13.125 --> 19:16.542
If they were for the mother-in-law,
what do you have for my daughter?

19:16.625 --> 19:18.542
- Dad!
- Thinking about the dowry?

19:18.625 --> 19:20.750
Well, life's tough these days.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.667
Thank you.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.708
- How far along are you?
- I'm due in three months. Thanks.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.417
- Do you mind if I touch it?
- No, go ahead.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.625
Are you two thinking about it?

19:32.167 --> 19:34.667
We want to, but Pablo travels a lot.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.042
It's easy
with the women in this family.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.917
If you sneeze at them
they get pregnant.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.417
- Dad!
- Oh, please!

19:42.375 --> 19:43.917
Well, is anyone missing?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.042
- Yes, my cousin.
- Anita? Good!

19:46.583 --> 19:47.625
Here.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.292
But you already gave me a present.

19:54.833 --> 19:55.667
Carlos!

19:55.750 --> 19:57.792
I love it.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.125
- Wow, it's like an engagement ring.
- It's lovely.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.542
- You've got good taste.
- Thank you.

20:03.625 --> 20:04.875
I'll get it.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.458
- Anita!
- Hello.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.542
- How are you?
- Great!

20:09.625 --> 20:11.792
Where's the birthday girl?

20:13.167 --> 20:14.833
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

20:14.917 --> 20:17.250
What a beautiful place.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.833
- It's lovely.
- Let me see.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.125
It's an amazing place.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.958
With all the vegetation and palm trees
it's like an African jungle.

20:26.042 --> 20:29.500
I've heard of that place,
it's like a tropical ecosystem.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.708
It's amazing that it's in Spain.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.375
- Less than 60 miles away.
- Right.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.667
- More wine?
- Yes, please.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.792
- Can you camp there?
- They look the other way.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.583
I don't know
why we're talking about it.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.125
Carlos, you should help me.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.500
School is more difficult now.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.583
You can't meet up during the week

20:48.667 --> 20:51.250
and then talk on the phone
until all hours.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.458
- Have you nothing to say?
- Me?

20:55.542 --> 20:58.625
You're doing very well.
I agree with everything.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.333
Laura?

21:36.875 --> 21:37.875
Marta?

21:37.958 --> 21:40.250
The teacher was worried.
He sent me to check on you.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.375
Are you okay?

21:45.958 --> 21:47.167
Christ!

21:48.583 --> 21:50.875
Look at it, please.
I can't look.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.250
Neither can I.

21:53.042 --> 21:56.333
What will you do if you are?
Have an abortion, right?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.625
- No, I'll have it.
- What?

21:59.708 --> 22:01.125
Are you stupid?

22:02.083 --> 22:03.500
Look at it, please.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.792
But, Laura,
your father will kill you.

22:05.875 --> 22:09.208
- They're divorced, he doesn't care.
- And your mother?

22:09.292 --> 22:12.125
She'll be annoyed,
but she had me at 17.

22:12.208 --> 22:15.875
You'll be cleaning up baby shit
and missing college.

22:16.625 --> 22:19.667
Do you want to spend
another four years studying?

22:19.750 --> 22:22.750
Fuck, Laura, you'll get a belly,
you'll be like a cow.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.500
You'll be the fucking joke
of the school.

22:26.583 --> 22:27.750
What do I care?

22:28.750 --> 22:31.042
I'll have it in the village,
like my mother did.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.583
It's nice there.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.583
On your own?

22:35.125 --> 22:38.458
No, Carlos would come
and I bet my mother would too.

22:38.542 --> 22:41.042
Her marriage is shit,
she hasn't got a job.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.833
Two lines mean I am.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.333
One.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.125
It's just as well, isn't it?

23:08.833 --> 23:10.208
Yes, it is.

23:13.583 --> 23:14.625
Come on.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.625
Don't keep thinking about it.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.167
Some of us are meeting
at my house on Saturday.

24:06.250 --> 24:09.167
I'll send you the address
if you feel like coming.

24:09.833 --> 24:13.375
- A pajama party?
- It sounds silly, but it'll be fun.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.917
You're an artist.

24:30.625 --> 24:32.333
I knew you'd like it.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.792
There's a guy in the street
staring at us.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.708
No, on the other sidewalk.

25:20.833 --> 25:23.458
- Who was it?
- My boyfriend from the village.

25:23.542 --> 25:24.917
Well, my ex.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.917
He called and said he wanted to see me.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.750
I told him I was with you.

25:32.542 --> 25:36.000
But he kept insisting,
so I saw him earlier.

25:37.958 --> 25:42.667
The thing is, we'd taken some time out
but we never split up.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.750
And then I met you.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.125
Then he isn't your ex.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.167
He is.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.500
What's his name?

25:55.250 --> 25:56.250
Juan.

25:56.333 --> 25:59.667
And when did you take time out?
When you came here?

25:59.750 --> 26:02.125
No, two months before.

26:03.167 --> 26:05.583
So you've been cheating on him
with me.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.875
Technically, yes.

26:11.792 --> 26:14.042
If he hadn't appeared,
would you have told me?

26:14.958 --> 26:16.458
Yes, I would.

26:20.333 --> 26:23.875
Carlos, I'd have told you
but you were showing me the masks.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.500
It's all right, really.

26:26.458 --> 26:29.958
I'll tell you everything
about my life, my boyfriends.

26:30.042 --> 26:31.625
I want to go home.

26:31.708 --> 26:34.083
Carlos, please. It's Saturday.

26:34.167 --> 26:37.958
Look, it threw me.
I just have to take it in.

26:38.042 --> 26:39.375
I'll text you later.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.958
Carlos, please.

26:53.125 --> 26:55.500
I'm coming, I'm coming!

27:23.375 --> 27:25.917
Hello, love. How are you?

27:26.500 --> 27:29.542
I was talking to your mother.
I took a course I want her to do.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.667
As a market trader.
Know what that is?

27:31.750 --> 27:33.375
You can earn a lot...

27:33.458 --> 27:34.542
Laura!

27:34.625 --> 27:36.042
Laura, love!

27:52.417 --> 27:55.500
She's a slut.
She's a fucking slut.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.167
But you never liked Pablo.

27:59.917 --> 28:01.125
And him?

28:01.750 --> 28:04.417
He's going to be a father
and he sleeps with a slut?

28:05.167 --> 28:07.375
God knows what he's given that baby.

28:12.917 --> 28:14.708
Maybe they'll get back together.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.708
I'd slit my wrists first, I swear.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.500
I don't think it's such a big deal.

28:25.125 --> 28:26.833
Really, I don't understand you.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.542
I hate lies.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.667
Why that expression?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.083
I didn't lie to you.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.708
What if I had been pregnant?

28:47.792 --> 28:48.792
Why bring that up?

28:49.417 --> 28:52.458
- What would you have done?
- We're not talking about that.

28:52.542 --> 28:54.083
What would you have done?

28:54.958 --> 28:57.208
I don't know. I don't know.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.833
I'm 18 and you're 17.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.583
Thanks for coming,
but I'd rather be alone.

29:42.708 --> 29:46.333
<i>He started touching my legs</i>
<i>to take the ants off</i>

29:47.333 --> 29:48.792
<i>and he pulled my skirt up.</i>

29:49.292 --> 29:52.042
<i>I was hysterical</i>
<i>because I hate ants.</i>

29:53.417 --> 29:57.125
And he knew that.
He was making it all up.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.583
In fact, he took a photo

29:59.667 --> 30:01.708
and said if I didn't undress

30:01.792 --> 30:05.000
he'd post it online
and my parents would see it.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.708
Fuck, that's lousy.

30:07.750 --> 30:10.417
- How long ago was that?
- I was 14.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.667
The worst thing is that now,
when I want to come,

30:14.750 --> 30:16.292
- I think about him.
- No way!

30:17.000 --> 30:18.083
- Yes.
- Fuck.

30:18.167 --> 30:20.125
- I've never come.
- No?

30:20.208 --> 30:21.958
You've never had an orgasm?

30:22.667 --> 30:23.667
No.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.750
- Have you tried with an older guy?
- No, that's disgusting!

30:26.833 --> 30:28.583
Don't be silly.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.417
If you haven't screwed
a 40-year-old, you haven't screwed.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.750
Your turn, Lola.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.875
What will I tell you?

30:35.708 --> 30:37.750
Tell us about
the first time you came.

30:39.583 --> 30:40.958
No, something heavier.

30:41.042 --> 30:42.042
Go on.

30:42.792 --> 30:46.625
This summer, in a bar,
I met an old boyfriend,

30:46.708 --> 30:49.042
and I went with him
to see if he'd improved.

30:50.042 --> 30:54.458
We were in bed, kissing
and remembering the old days,

30:55.250 --> 30:57.292
and suddenly he said
he'd do it from behind.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.208
Wait.

30:58.292 --> 31:01.167
Behind, like a dog,
or behind-behind?

31:01.250 --> 31:02.833
- Behind-behind.
- No!

31:03.750 --> 31:05.042
He started putting it in...

31:06.125 --> 31:08.792
and at first, it was hurting a bit.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.542
That's normal.

31:10.625 --> 31:13.792
But suddenly
I started liking it, a lot,

31:13.875 --> 31:17.208
and I came.
I came like a pig!

31:17.292 --> 31:19.542
No! And what's it like?

31:19.667 --> 31:21.708
It's like shitting inside.

31:23.417 --> 31:24.833
You're filthy!

31:31.000 --> 31:32.458
Just turn it off.

31:37.292 --> 31:38.333
Your turn.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.292
Tell us something.

31:40.958 --> 31:42.375
I can't think of anything.

31:42.458 --> 31:45.000
- Come on.
- I can think of something.

31:45.708 --> 31:46.542
What?

31:46.625 --> 31:47.708
The parcel.

31:47.792 --> 31:49.375
You swore you didn't open it!

31:49.458 --> 31:52.708
What?
The parcel of rolled toilet paper.

31:52.792 --> 31:54.542
Oh, that nonsense!

31:54.625 --> 31:55.625
What?

31:55.708 --> 31:57.250
I did a pregnancy test.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.333
- Are you pregnant?
- No.

32:00.167 --> 32:01.542
She didn't want an abortion.

32:01.625 --> 32:04.292
- Seriously?
- Yes.

32:04.375 --> 32:07.625
Well, tell us something kinky.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.333
Yeah, filthy.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.583
Have you never done anything very...?

32:11.667 --> 32:14.958
In the village, don't you screw cows
and things for fun?

32:15.042 --> 32:18.917
Sure, since we don't have TV
or the Internet we have to do something.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.958
You have to tell us something real.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.167
Come on, tell us something.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.958
Come on, tell us.
Something heavy.

32:34.708 --> 32:37.375
I did something
you couldn't imagine.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.875
I've done everything.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.750
Not this.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.792
Laura... are you awake?

32:51.083 --> 32:52.167
Yes.

32:56.083 --> 32:57.292
Are you okay?

32:59.833 --> 33:00.875
Yes.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.542
I'm sorry that you're worried.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.250
I'd like to be able to love
the way you can.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.875
Have you never been in love?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.250
Yes,

33:26.917 --> 33:29.375
but I always end up
suffering too much.

33:30.792 --> 33:32.167
You're beautiful.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.458
We're going to have fun.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.958
Let's go to sleep.

34:12.833 --> 34:13.875
Hello.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.292
I left a message on the phone.

34:23.167 --> 34:26.292
I was with Marta, from school,
and two other girls.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.167
You want to live your life?

34:34.292 --> 34:35.917
Then you can pay for it.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.958
Tomorrow you start looking
for a weekend job.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.500
Is that what you care about?

34:48.375 --> 34:50.167
Have you nothing to tell me?

34:50.250 --> 34:52.708
To tell you?
Absolutely nothing.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.792
Leave the phone there.
I pay for it.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.917
- You want the phone?
- Yes, I want the phone.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.042
Okay.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.417
Take the fucking phone!

35:25.458 --> 35:27.083
<i>What about the fraud case?</i>

35:27.167 --> 35:30.167
- Was it true?
- I don't doubt it. It's fraud.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.750
First, he makes
an inter-community acquisition

35:32.833 --> 35:35.625
in which there is a tax
on consumer spending

35:35.708 --> 35:37.375
that is also deducted.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.917
When the merchandise
enters the interior market,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.917
it has the output tax which gives
the buyer the right to deduct it,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.125
but then he pays it...

35:56.125 --> 35:58.292
Babe, are you okay?
Why haven't you texted?

35:58.375 --> 35:59.583
<i>Carlos, this is Merche.</i>

35:59.667 --> 36:04.000
<i>- This is no time to call.</i>
- I have to speak to Laura.

36:04.083 --> 36:07.583
<i>You can speak tomorrow.</i>
<i>Please, don't call again at this time.</i>

36:43.208 --> 36:44.625
Forgive me.

36:44.708 --> 36:45.875
You forgive me.

36:45.958 --> 36:49.083
If you'd been pregnant,
we would have had it, I swear.

37:23.958 --> 37:25.000
Excuse me.

37:25.917 --> 37:29.917
If you don't want an apprentice,
remove the sign. It can mislead people.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.333
No one has ever come in
to ask about that sign.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.104
How do I know you won't steal from me?

37:38.083 --> 37:38.917
What?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.167
How do I know you're not a thief?

37:41.250 --> 37:44.917
I'm not going to steal.
I can even leave you my ID.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.417
That's no use to me.

37:50.625 --> 37:51.625
Look.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.500
I can leave this watch as collateral.
It's a pretty good one.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.167
My father gave it to me.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.375
Unpaid?

38:01.375 --> 38:04.125
Monday to Friday,
9:00 to 2:00 and 4:00 to 8:00.

38:07.083 --> 38:09.250
All right, come tomorrow at 9:00.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.000
I couldn't do it,
old guys don't turn me on.

38:17.083 --> 38:18.208
Not even Matt Damon?

38:18.292 --> 38:20.667
I don't know.
I've never been with a 40-year-old.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.042
There's one I would do it with.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.500
With her stepfather.

38:23.583 --> 38:26.167
My stepfather?
You don't even know him!

38:26.250 --> 38:27.667
I saw him on Facebook!

38:27.750 --> 38:29.875
- You slut!
- I want to see him.

38:29.958 --> 38:31.542
All right. I've got a couple.

38:31.625 --> 38:32.625
Erase that photo!

38:34.750 --> 38:35.875
What was that?

38:35.958 --> 38:37.875
- Show me the photo.
- All right.

38:39.042 --> 38:40.875
You barely inhaled. Take a drag.

38:43.083 --> 38:46.000
- You go all out!
- What style!

38:47.125 --> 38:48.917
The problem with getting pregnant

38:49.000 --> 38:51.792
is that you're stuck with the father
the rest of your life.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.000
I'd like to be connected
to Carlos forever.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.875
- But he's gay.
- Don't say that!

38:56.417 --> 38:57.542
Fuck!

38:57.625 --> 39:01.375
Talk to him. He might need help
to come out of the closet.

39:01.458 --> 39:02.625
He isn't gay.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.875
- Stop that.
- Well, he isn't exactly normal.

39:04.958 --> 39:06.333
I would know.

39:06.875 --> 39:09.583
I like Carlos.
Maybe he's bisexual.

39:09.667 --> 39:13.583
- It's possible.
- Maybe he's into everything.

39:21.083 --> 39:22.458
Aren't you coming to bed?

39:23.042 --> 39:24.542
No, I'm not sleepy.

39:28.833 --> 39:33.500
- Is anything wrong?
- No. I'm going to finish this.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.167
I'll wait for you in bed.

39:50.875 --> 39:52.083
What are you studying?

39:53.167 --> 39:54.292
Math.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.375
I was terrible at that.

39:57.708 --> 39:59.917
I wanted to ask you a question.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.292
Go ahead.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.292
Look, I don't mind
and I won't get angry.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.375
I know that the day we moved...

40:11.208 --> 40:15.167
you slept with Carlos
in your aunt's bed.

40:15.250 --> 40:16.250
That's normal.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.417
The bed is bigger
and you're at that age.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.750
It's okay.

40:20.833 --> 40:24.542
On Saturday,
did you use our bedroom?

40:25.958 --> 40:28.042
It's all right,
I won't be angry.

40:29.958 --> 40:31.042
No.

40:31.917 --> 40:35.583
Laura, I don't mind,
and I won't tell your mother.

40:37.042 --> 40:40.292
I was out all evening
and I slept at a friend's house.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.250
Why?

40:42.333 --> 40:43.917
A friend's house?

40:54.250 --> 40:55.625
That's why she's so angry.

40:58.292 --> 40:59.625
Yeah, well.

41:31.292 --> 41:33.708
- What will you do?
- I don't know.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.625
- I'd like you to explain.
- What's wrong?

41:36.708 --> 41:39.667
You don't want a boyfriend
who just repairs watches?

41:40.583 --> 41:44.333
Look, you can repair watches
or do whatever you want.

41:44.417 --> 41:47.292
But you've got a lot of talent.

41:47.375 --> 41:51.000
What do you know?
What qualifies you to say I have talent?

41:52.625 --> 41:54.500
You could pass the tests.

41:54.583 --> 41:57.250
What do you get
from working on watches?

41:57.333 --> 41:58.542
I like it.

41:59.208 --> 42:01.083
And I have time to think.

42:15.083 --> 42:17.542
I have to go.
See you tomorrow, okay?

42:17.625 --> 42:18.917
So long.

42:58.583 --> 42:59.958
Are you all right?

43:01.333 --> 43:02.917
I'm sorry about Pablo.

43:04.208 --> 43:07.333
Pablo? He's going to Stuttgart.

43:10.417 --> 43:11.792
To work?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.917
I need you to do me a favor.

43:25.625 --> 43:27.292
Pablo found...

43:29.208 --> 43:31.458
part of a wrapper

43:32.333 --> 43:34.375
from a condom

43:36.458 --> 43:38.083
in our bedroom.

43:42.667 --> 43:44.625
If he asks me again,

43:49.833 --> 43:51.750
I'm going to tell him

43:51.833 --> 43:54.292
that I've spoken to you
and that you and Carlos

43:55.000 --> 43:57.458
used the bedroom
when we weren't here.

44:00.375 --> 44:01.375
Okay?

44:09.333 --> 44:11.250
Don't get all sanctimonious.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.833
There's a party on Saturday night.

44:24.917 --> 44:26.375
I'll be home late.

44:48.292 --> 44:49.958
Carlos, sit down.

44:50.042 --> 44:52.083
Your mother and I
want to talk to you.

44:58.667 --> 44:59.917
Vazquez called.

45:00.625 --> 45:03.500
We know you haven't been
in class for two weeks.

45:03.583 --> 45:06.458
Did we put any pressure on you
to study law?

45:08.417 --> 45:10.458
Did we say anything?

45:12.167 --> 45:13.208
No.

45:13.292 --> 45:15.667
We said it was a personal decision.

45:15.750 --> 45:18.667
If you've started law,
you have to finish it.

45:23.667 --> 45:25.167
I'd rather not do that.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.958
- What?
- Not do what?

45:29.250 --> 45:31.000
Is it your girlfriend?

45:31.083 --> 45:32.083
No.

45:32.167 --> 45:35.625
This isn't a joke.
We're talking about your future.

45:43.542 --> 45:45.500
May I get up now?

45:48.375 --> 45:49.375
Yes.

46:16.125 --> 46:17.667
The cardboard, Laura.

46:29.958 --> 46:30.958
It doesn't stop.

46:32.667 --> 46:34.625
- What is it?
- The lift.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.625
You know no one comes here.

46:37.583 --> 46:38.583
Someone's there.

46:41.042 --> 46:42.958
I'm about to come.

46:43.042 --> 46:44.167
Laura, someone's there.

46:44.833 --> 46:46.042
That's impossible.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.625
Yes there is! Fuck!

47:17.667 --> 47:20.083
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it anymore.

47:20.667 --> 47:22.417
We have to keep hiding like dogs.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.625
It's shit.

47:26.333 --> 47:28.000
We have to do something.

47:31.458 --> 47:32.708
Get dressed, go on.

47:41.958 --> 47:42.958
Let's run away.

47:43.417 --> 47:45.042
Let's go and live together.

47:45.125 --> 47:47.375
- What are you talking about?
- Running away.

47:47.458 --> 47:49.000
Far from this fucking city.

47:50.083 --> 47:52.583
Right now, just the way we are.

47:53.792 --> 47:55.083
I don't believe you!

47:55.750 --> 47:57.833
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

47:59.167 --> 48:00.875
Look, I could work in a factory,

48:01.458 --> 48:02.792
or in the country.

48:03.417 --> 48:04.833
Would you like to?

48:12.583 --> 48:13.792
We could go to my village.

48:17.833 --> 48:20.917
Let's go!
It's the answer to all our problems.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.208
We'd be away from our parents,
we could do what we wanted

48:24.292 --> 48:27.542
- without explaining ourselves.
- We'd have our own house.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.500
- We'd make love when we wanted.
- And be free!

48:30.583 --> 48:33.000
You'll love the village.
You can paint in peace.

48:33.083 --> 48:34.250
We can't go there.

48:34.333 --> 48:36.000
It's the first place they'd look.

48:37.583 --> 48:40.208
You'll miss this term
but then you can make it up.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.083
Then you can study
or do what you want.

48:42.875 --> 48:44.208
I don't want to study.

48:44.292 --> 48:46.542
I'll be working,
so I can take care of you.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.667
We could go to Medina del Campo.
I'd get work there.

48:49.750 --> 48:53.000
- I've got a friend there.
- Fuck, that's perfect!

48:53.625 --> 48:57.167
We'll have a sound system
and play music as loud as we like.

49:00.167 --> 49:02.708
That'll have to wait a while,
but we'll get it.

49:04.125 --> 49:05.125
Run!

49:14.583 --> 49:15.917
Wait!

49:16.000 --> 49:18.417
- My green sweater is in your house.
- Forget it.

49:18.917 --> 49:19.958
But we're here.

49:20.042 --> 49:22.750
Let's go now, come on.
Or we'll never go.

49:23.292 --> 49:24.667
I'll just get my sweater.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.583
We'll buy another one. Please.

49:27.375 --> 49:28.750
We'll take the first bus.

49:29.208 --> 49:30.958
It'll just take a minute.

49:31.042 --> 49:32.292
Please.

49:33.083 --> 49:34.083
Don't be silly.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.500
Hello, love!

49:49.583 --> 49:51.458
- Hello, Carmen.
- Is Carlos with you?

49:52.333 --> 49:54.667
Yes, but I just wanted
to get my sweater.

49:54.750 --> 49:57.750
No, come in.
Would you like some torrijas?

49:57.833 --> 50:01.500
I love torrijas. But we can't.

50:01.583 --> 50:04.667
Come on! Keep me company
for a while, I'm so bored.

50:04.750 --> 50:07.708
- Charo wasn't able to come today.
- I don't know.

50:07.792 --> 50:10.500
- Come on.
- I'll see what Carlos says.

50:10.583 --> 50:14.000
Carlos loves torrijas.
Leave it to me, I'll persuade him.

50:14.083 --> 50:16.833
- I don't know.
- Come on, come in.

50:16.917 --> 50:18.667
I put the sweater in his closet.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.375
Use the slippers, love.
I just waxed the floor.

50:41.292 --> 50:43.542
And you can stay out
as late as you want?

50:43.625 --> 50:44.792
Yes.

50:46.542 --> 50:48.375
I promised I'd go to the party.

50:51.083 --> 50:53.708
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

50:54.583 --> 50:57.042
Have you ever thought
you might like boys?

50:57.125 --> 50:59.292
I don't know. Even just a bit?

50:59.792 --> 51:01.083
That you're bisexual?

51:02.208 --> 51:03.458
What's this about?

51:04.208 --> 51:08.333
Some very cool people are bisexual,
like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.

51:08.417 --> 51:10.292
What are you trying to say?

51:11.000 --> 51:14.708
There are people who think
that what we did on my birthday...

51:15.458 --> 51:16.458
I don't know.

51:19.375 --> 51:21.125
You should know.

51:23.583 --> 51:24.917
And I do.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.792
Come on, we'll stay a while
and then we'll leave.

51:35.333 --> 51:36.917
What people?

51:37.000 --> 51:38.583
What do you mean?

51:39.375 --> 51:42.083
Before you said,
"There are people who think..."

51:42.167 --> 51:44.000
Did you tell anyone?

51:44.583 --> 51:47.458
- I don't understand.
- Did you tell anyone what we did?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.667
- It's a figure of speech.
- Wait.

51:52.917 --> 51:55.500
Come on, just for a while.

52:04.375 --> 52:05.625
Hey!

52:07.208 --> 52:09.542
- This is girls' night.
- Don't be like that.

52:12.417 --> 52:13.792
Let's go to the bathroom.

52:17.458 --> 52:19.167
Hey, hang on, okay?

52:21.375 --> 52:23.250
I'll be right back.
Go get a drink.

52:24.250 --> 52:26.708
It stops you from feeling dizzy,
stops headaches.

52:26.792 --> 52:29.083
You can take anything,
your folks won't know.

52:29.167 --> 52:30.875
- What is it?
- What does it matter?

52:30.958 --> 52:33.583
The thing is it works.
Give me 20 and you'll see.

52:33.667 --> 52:35.500
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.

52:35.583 --> 52:37.958
Look, I take them from my brother.

52:38.667 --> 52:41.292
He gets them
for after his chemotherapy.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.833
They leave you feeling like new.
What are you looking at?

52:43.917 --> 52:45.750
- Sorry.
- You want to make out?

52:46.292 --> 52:48.542
- Or do you want a pill? 20.
- No, thanks.

52:55.667 --> 52:57.167
Fuck, what are you doing?

52:57.250 --> 53:00.625
Calm down, we'll be out now.
Three of us have to piss.

53:02.250 --> 53:03.250
What a pain.

53:04.083 --> 53:06.542
You're making a mess of that.
Let me do it.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.708
I told Alex that Susana fancies him
and wants to screw him.

53:10.792 --> 53:12.875
She'll kill you.

53:12.958 --> 53:17.000
I had to do something about them.
They're both useless.

53:17.083 --> 53:19.542
- You're crazy.
- What are you doing?

53:19.625 --> 53:22.000
- I'm wetting myself!
- Take it easy!

53:22.542 --> 53:23.833
Mega-pain!

53:27.458 --> 53:29.833
- What do you think?
- Wait a minute.

53:37.792 --> 53:40.042
- I'm going to get Carlos.
- No, wait, wait.

53:40.125 --> 53:42.917
- We'll tell Susana about Alex.
- He's been waiting for ages.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.250
Don't feel guilty. Come on!

53:50.583 --> 53:53.375
Tell Alex what you like.
Explain in detail.

53:53.458 --> 53:57.000
Tell him how you want him
to undress you, to suck your tits,

53:57.083 --> 53:59.583
- how to eat your...
- Lola, you're a brute.

53:59.667 --> 54:01.458
I want him to be my boyfriend.

54:01.542 --> 54:03.500
All right, to love!

54:03.583 --> 54:04.750
To love!

54:09.875 --> 54:10.917
Another one.

54:11.625 --> 54:12.958
- Not for me.
- What's up?

54:13.042 --> 54:14.726
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you later.

54:14.750 --> 54:15.750
Laura!

54:24.292 --> 54:25.667
Where are you going?

54:25.750 --> 54:27.583
- Have you seen my boyfriend?
- No,

54:27.667 --> 54:30.333
but if I were him,
I wouldn't leave you on your own.

54:31.333 --> 54:33.125
When will you give me a chance?

54:33.750 --> 54:35.917
I'd never get involved with you.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.750
I don't want to get involved,
I want to be with you.

54:43.917 --> 54:45.542
- I'm back now.
- I'm leaving.

54:45.625 --> 54:48.583
Don't. We'll have fun
and then go where you want.

54:48.667 --> 54:50.208
Who did you tell
about what we did?

54:51.583 --> 54:53.417
- What do you mean?
- Fuck you!

54:53.500 --> 54:54.708
Carlos, please.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.333
- Laura, you're here!
- Hi, Alex.

54:58.458 --> 55:00.208
- This is Carlos, my boyfriend.
- Hi.

55:00.292 --> 55:01.833
Alex, a classmate.

55:01.917 --> 55:04.917
- Want to get some drinks?
- All right.

55:10.375 --> 55:11.875
Where are you going?

55:12.333 --> 55:15.000
- Carlos!
- Swear that you told no one!

55:16.208 --> 55:17.958
- What's wrong with you?
- Swear.

55:18.375 --> 55:19.500
I swear.

55:21.292 --> 55:22.875
Go back to your friends.

56:42.375 --> 56:43.667
What's wrong?

56:58.667 --> 57:00.542
I'd like you to be happy.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.250
I'm happy with you.

57:16.708 --> 57:18.375
We need time.

57:20.583 --> 57:22.250
I don't know who I am.

57:23.750 --> 57:25.292
Or who you are.

57:28.875 --> 57:31.000
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:22.458
Is it full?

01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:25.375
One of the disadvantages of being a girl.

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:26.875
- I'll see you later.
- Hey...

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.917
which painters do you like?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.833
Why?

01:00:31.917 --> 01:00:34.083
You paint, don't you?

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:36.583
Well, I really like Boccioni.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:37.958
The Italian futurist.

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:39.833
- You know him?
- Of course.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:44.250
They say he was killed falling off
a horse, but I think it was suicide.

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:46.792
My turn.

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:52.750
There's a room full of paintings

01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:56.208
with people who seem to look at you
as if you'd killed someone.

01:00:57.417 --> 01:00:59.917
Behind it is the secret door
into the bedrooms.

01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:02.250
That's cool.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:14.375
I really like you.
I think I may be falling in love.

01:01:16.292 --> 01:01:18.500
I'm in love with my boyfriend.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:21.667
Your ex-boyfriend, you mean,
because he's left you.

01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:25.000
No, we've taken time out to think.

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:29.750
To think what? That's stupid.
I don't need to think. I'm not...

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:32.167
What have you done?

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:33.750
Fuck...

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:35.958
- Wait.
- No, leave it.

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.000
- It's nothing.
- What happened?

01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.375
The fucking glass.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:41.417
Don't ruin your scarf.
It's nothing.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.750
I'll go to the washroom.
Don't ruin your scarf, Laura.

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:47.875
It's just blood.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.667
Stay here. Don't worry.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.042
Where are you going?

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:56.875
- Look, I'm okay.
- You're not. Where are you going?

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.292
I'm okay, Laura.

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:03.375
You can't ride the bike like this.
You're drunk.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:06.000
- I'm okay, Laura.
- No, you're not okay.

01:02:06.083 --> 01:02:07.708
Look at yourself, you're not okay.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:10.917
- Let Alex take you.
- Yes, Alex can take you.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.250
Sure, I don't mind.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:13.667
I wanted to take you home.

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:16.500
Do it for me, please.

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:21.958
All right? Please.

01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:25.875
Seriously.

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:28.875
- Alex, can you take him home?
- Have you got a helmet?

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:35.042
- Alex, are you fit to drive?
- Yeah, I'm great.

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:39.792
The keys.

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:44.625
You're stoned out of your mind.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:47.625
And I didn't make out once!

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.500
- What does that say?
- You're filthy!

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.976
We haven't had enough to drink.
I usually put the whole thing.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.500
- Can we go now?
- Yes, let's go.

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:20.917
- And when will I see you?
- I don't know.

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.500
I'm here every Saturday.

01:03:26.292 --> 01:03:27.292
Shit, the bus!

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:29.542
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.833
- Hi, there! How are you?
- Hello.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:01.125
- Were you at Stusy?
- No, at Spook.

01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:03.750
- The '82 party.
- Cool.

01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:07.542
- Who was the DJ?
- Someone from Amsterdam.

01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:08.833
What was the music?

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:10.250
Techno.

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.917
- Do you like techno?
- Not much.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.500
It's not your style.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.542
Do you mind sitting in the back?

01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:20.583
- What was it like?
- Pretty good. It's cool.

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:24.542
- Where have you been?
- It's near La Central.

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:28.375
- It's a cool place, it was packed.
- Yeah?

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:31.000
How come you left so early?

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.917
I don't know.
I got a bit fed up in the end.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.625
What's wrong?

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.792
Are you okay?
You seem strange.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:59.500
You'll never want
to be with me again.

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:03.667
That isn't the question.
We've taken time out to think.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.667
I'm going to date someone.

01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:13.917
You're joking.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.625
No, I'm not.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.583
Who?

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:22.125
El Moro.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.458
You are joking!

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:28.250
He isn't like you think.
He's in love with me.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.333
Are you serious?

01:05:32.292 --> 01:05:34.167
- Yes.
- With El Moro?

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:36.750
But he screws everything!

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:38.333
Can you keep your voice down?

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.583
If I date him
you'll never come back to me.

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:44.292
It's only been two weeks.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.583
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.458
- What about me?
- You left me!

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:56.667
Just so we could sort things out.

01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:02.000
- That isn't possible now.
- Don't say that.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.458
It is. I love you.

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:10.000
- We're very different.
- Complementary.

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.583
- Don't you love me?
- Yes.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.375
Well, then?

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:21.167
I don't know. I need to try.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.208
And then I'll know what I really want.

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.042
I need to try.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:04.917
Are you okay?

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:07.042
A bit dizzy.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:09.125
We'll talk tomorrow.

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.208
What are you doing here?

01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:58.958
I wanted to see you.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.667
I've been thinking

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.500
and it's best
if you go out with that guy.

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:08.500
So you can appreciate what we have
and know what I'm worth.

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:12.375
Thanks, I have to go.

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:15.000
And I wanted to say
that you won't lose me.

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:17.250
- I will lose you.
- No.

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:19.542
- You'll never forgive me.
- No.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.417
When are you seeing him?

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.582
- Let me go.
- Tell me.

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.417
Are you going to bed with him?

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.707
Don't do this.

01:08:30.332 --> 01:08:32.750
Tell me. Tell me, please.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.792
Tell me.

01:08:36.457 --> 01:08:37.957
We're not children.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.417
I know you're going to do it.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.207
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:44.125
When are you seeing him?

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:46.667
What does it matter?

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:49.000
Exactly. If it doesn't matter...

01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:52.667
I don't know, I don't know.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.542
- Tell me, please.
- Friday!

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:56.582
All right. Wait a minute.

01:08:57.957 --> 01:08:59.207
Call me afterwards.

01:08:59.292 --> 01:09:02.000
- No, Carlos.
- Please, promise me.

01:09:02.875 --> 01:09:05.042
- Call me when you come back.
- Okay.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.625
FRIDAY, APRIL 29

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.875
You're fired.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:42.957
- What?
- You're fired.

01:09:43.042 --> 01:09:44.917
You gave me the morning off.

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:48.125
Your father told me
you're studying law.

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:51.042
So go back to your studies.
It's your duty.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:56.792
Wait.

01:09:57.875 --> 01:09:58.875
Here.

01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:02.958
You'll thank me for it.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.875
Go and get dressed.

01:11:00.292 --> 01:11:01.708
Grandma died.

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:45.458
I don't feel well.
I'm going to the cafe.

01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:47.875
I have some ibuprofen.

01:11:50.292 --> 01:11:52.417
- Thanks.
- Don't take too long.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.792
Do you have some money?

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:57.417
Grandma is in room 7.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.125
Hurry back.

01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:31.208
AVAILABLE

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.500
OCCUPIED

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:04.458
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for Laura.

01:13:05.042 --> 01:13:06.500
I thought she was with you.

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.500
No, she's with another guy.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.333
I understand.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.458
I want to go away with her
for a few days.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:22.167
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Yes.

01:13:23.083 --> 01:13:25.333
I think we just need some time.

01:13:25.417 --> 01:13:28.333
- If we're alone, we can sort it out.
- What you need

01:13:28.417 --> 01:13:30.208
is to give each other space.

01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:34.333
Laura is too young for such
a serious relationship, and so are you.

01:13:36.042 --> 01:13:38.458
You still have a lot of living to do.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:40.833
We love each other.

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:45.583
There she is.

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:50.625
If she wants to go away with you
for a few days, I don't mind.

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.625
You're late.

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.417
We agreed I'd call you.

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:09.167
What were you saying to my mother?

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.583
Did you do it?

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:13.542
I didn't even see him.

01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:16.333
What's this about?

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:18.708
Are you seeing him tomorrow?

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:20.750
This was a bad idea.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.500
Don't do it, please.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.708
Let's go to the place
with the palm trees.

01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:32.083
We could go tomorrow morning.

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.417
Don't wait for me tomorrow.

01:14:40.167 --> 01:14:42.833
I won't phone you,
and I won't answer my phone.

01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:46.583
Don't do it, please!

01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:50.917
What's so funny?

01:15:52.708 --> 01:15:55.792
- Are you sure I can go in there?
- Of course you can.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.792
- Isn't it neat?
- It really is.

01:16:03.542 --> 01:16:05.917
And this is
the Chamber of Deputies,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.083
with representatives
of the main royal towns.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.917
And the clergy here are the scariest.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.042
- They terrify me.
- My God!

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:21.917
- Look at their faces!
- You see?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.375
They're looking at us.

01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:26.167
And here's the secret door
I told you about.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.958
This leads to the bedrooms.

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:30.125
Wow!

01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:38.458
- Did he really sleep here?
- And he brought his mistresses.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.750
The fucking kings are something else.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:42.583
Come here.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:45.833
Lie down.
It's an amazing sensation.

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:47.625
I don't think I dare.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.417
Are you scared?

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:57.083
- What if it breaks?
- Don't be silly.

01:16:57.875 --> 01:16:59.333
Look. You see?

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:20.667
El Moro is a bastard.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.750
But don't worry,
he dumps them really fast.

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:25.667
Forget about girlfriends.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.292
With a good jerk-off...

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:29.458
Dickhead!

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:31.750
Pass me the joint.

01:17:32.875 --> 01:17:36.500
- It's passed, you don't ask for it.
- That's rubbish.

01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:41.625
Listen, it's too bad about El Moro
because he really puts on a show.

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:43.583
He never fails.

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:46.542
He takes them on a night tour
of the parliament building,

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.125
a private one!

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:50.875
And he screws them on the king's bed.

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:56.458
No way.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.708
Didn't you know?

01:17:58.792 --> 01:18:00.750
In the parliament building?

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:02.833
Yes.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.500
A royal screw!

01:18:07.792 --> 01:18:09.667
Nobody believes that.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.750
He works weekends
and studies weekdays.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:16.208
Since he's a security guard,

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.625
he gives them a guided tour,
he shows them the paintings,

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.458
all of that...

01:18:21.542 --> 01:18:23.667
and then he screws them.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.958
The first time is always there.

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.958
He says they go crazy for it.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:34.167
Don't laugh, he did your sister.

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:36.292
- That's a lie.
- You know it isn't.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:40.083
- It is a fucking lie.
- Do you need to see the used condom?

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.042
Where are you going, dickhead?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.708
Hey, where are you going?
You can't go in there!

01:19:37.792 --> 01:19:40.917
It's an emergency, I have to speak
to El Moro. He works here.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.833
There's no one here with that name.

01:19:44.042 --> 01:19:46.667
Well, it's a nickname.
His name is...

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:47.750
Garcia.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.375
Or Garces. Garces.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.750
- What do you want?
- I have to speak to him.

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.375
He's doing his rounds.

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:55.625
Can you call him?

01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.167
- If he's your friend, you call him.
- My battery's flat.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.708
Yeah, and you're drunk.

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:03.792
- Can you call him?
- He'll be back soon.

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:05.875
Please call him from that gadget.

01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:08.042
- It's for emergencies.
- This is an emergency!

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:10.417
- What's the emergency?
- He's fucking my girlfriend!

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.792
- Calm down, calm down.
- Laura! Laura!

01:20:16.417 --> 01:20:18.125
- Move!
- Motherfuckers!

01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:20.250
Get the hell out of here!

01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:23.583
- Kid, you've better get out of here.
- Scram.

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:42.583
<i>Moro.</i>

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:44.458
<i>- Moro.</i>
- Sorry.

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:49.750
What is it?

01:20:50.542 --> 01:20:53.292
<i>We had a jealous boyfriend here</i>
<i>looking for you.</i>

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:55.083
Yeah, very funny.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.875
<i>Don't be a smartass,</i>
<i>listen to the shouting outside.</i>

01:20:58.958 --> 01:21:00.875
What are you talking about, moron?

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:07.000
Laura!

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.417
Laura!

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:14.958
Laura!

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.333
Laura!

01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:51.292
Laura!

01:21:57.792 --> 01:21:59.417
Do you want to go to him?

01:22:04.667 --> 01:22:06.250
Laura, please!

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:23.708
Bitch!

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:27.917
Laura!

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:30.958
Bitch!

01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:37.375
Bitch...

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.292
<i>Emergency services.</i>

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:29.208
There's a bomb
in the parliament building.

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:30.917
Under the king's bed.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:35.000
- It'll explode in 15 minutes.
<i>- Please tell me your name and ID.</i>

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.958
She's so beautiful.

01:25:33.917 --> 01:25:35.417
Yes, she is.

01:26:43.542 --> 01:26:45.958
I was at the hospital seeing my sister.

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.792
It all went well.

01:26:58.208 --> 01:26:59.917
I'm going back to the village.

01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:05.083
I've spoken to your father
so that you can stay if you want.

01:27:06.042 --> 01:27:08.000
We'll find a college dorm.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.917
Do you remember when I was seven?

01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:39.708
I was very sick, I had a fever.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:48.500
Dad had just left
and you were very angry.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.583
You told me that I should never marry

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:03.333
until I was economically independent.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.917
I don't know
if it was because of the fever

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.917
but I was really scared,

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:15.958
and I told you

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.375
that I couldn't live if you died.

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:25.417
Do you remember?

01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:36.292
I don't know why on earth I said

01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:42.125
"economically independent"
to a child of seven.

01:30:00.167 --> 01:30:02.292
He hasn't come out for three weeks.

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:05.458
Maybe you can persuade him.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:16.500
Carlos, my son,
look who's come to see you.

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:23.167
Help me persuade him
to apply for Fine Arts.

01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:26.542
The tests are in June
and he'll have to get ready.

01:30:27.583 --> 01:30:28.667
Please.

01:30:38.625 --> 01:30:39.875
Hello, Carlos.

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.458
I know you don't want to see me but...

01:30:53.667 --> 01:30:55.792
I needed to say goodbye properly.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.167
I'm going to the village.
My mother is separated.

01:31:07.042 --> 01:31:08.750
I wanted you to know

01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:11.333
that you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:31:14.167 --> 01:31:16.375
And that I'm very sorry
that I hurt you.

01:31:19.417 --> 01:31:20.792
How's El Moro?

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:24.208
That's over.
It was a mistake.

01:31:28.542 --> 01:31:32.583
Know what?
My sister was born.

01:31:34.458 --> 01:31:37.083
When I held her
I thought she was our daughter.

01:31:40.708 --> 01:31:41.917
I love you.

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:45.708
I think I'll always love you.

01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:48.458
Yeah.

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:50.750
It's true.

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:52.958
Until a good dick appears.

01:31:55.292 --> 01:31:57.625
I think I did it
to try to forget you,

01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:00.583
and so you'd forget me.

01:32:03.292 --> 01:32:05.125
Did you fuck him?

01:32:07.292 --> 01:32:08.958
Being with you

01:32:09.042 --> 01:32:11.792
was the loveliest,
most romantic thing I've ever known,

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:16.167
and I regret telling the girls
about what we did.

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:18.375
Did you come?

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:23.208
No one has given me
as much pleasure as you.

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.958
You haven't answered me.

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:34.875
Look.

01:32:36.208 --> 01:32:38.167
I did this
so you'll never forget our story.

01:32:39.458 --> 01:32:41.417
I had to redo it lots of times.

01:32:42.625 --> 01:32:43.958
Did you come?

01:32:51.167 --> 01:32:52.708
Yes, I came.

01:32:55.792 --> 01:32:57.500
Sex with you is wonderful.

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:01.292
And I want you to know
that my heart is yours

01:33:03.583 --> 01:33:05.292
and it always will be,

01:33:06.292 --> 01:33:08.875
and whenever you desire me
you'll have me.

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.458
Now.

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:22.750
What?

01:33:22.833 --> 01:33:24.458
I want to have you now.

01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:27.625
Show me that they're not just words.

01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:29.667
You want to make love?

01:33:31.042 --> 01:33:32.667
Call it what you want.

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:38.000
Carlos, you're not well now.

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.000
That's why.

01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:42.667
Maybe it would help me.

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.125
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:35:05.083 --> 01:35:06.958
Will you give me a kiss at least?

01:35:35.958 --> 01:35:37.417
I'm on the pill.

01:35:38.458 --> 01:35:40.458
I don't want to catch anything.

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:16.083
You're not like this.

01:36:18.542 --> 01:36:20.708
- Don't let anyone say otherwise.
- Shut up.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.708
Get on top.

01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:49.333
I'll be back soon.

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:53.583
Faster.

01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:59.750
I hope we realize
we can't live without each other,

01:36:59.833 --> 01:37:02.167
and we can start over
from the beginning.

01:37:05.542 --> 01:37:06.708
Stop.

01:37:57.125 --> 01:37:58.250
Please,

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.333
don't forget me.

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:14.083
I'm sorry.

01:38:31.083 --> 01:38:32.417
I am you.

01:38:57.167 --> 01:38:58.458
I am you.

01:40:14.042 --> 01:40:15.625
<i>I am you.</i>

01:41:44.042 --> 01:41:45.792
<i>I'd like to feel what you feel,</i>

01:41:45.875 --> 01:41:47.625
<i>think what you think.</i>

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:11.417
<i>I am you.</i>

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:13.250
<i>I am you.</i>

01:42:13.333 --> 01:42:15.417
<i>- You are me.</i>
<i>- You are me.</i>

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.417
<i>- I could feel inside you.</i>
<i>- There are moments,</i>

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.976
<i>- when I want to stop being me...</i>
<i>- I dreamed I was inside you.</i>

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.375
<i>- ...so I can be you.</i>
<i>- Recently...</i>

01:42:23.458 --> 01:42:25.500
<i>Nothing about you disgusts me.</i>

01:42:25.583 --> 01:42:29.042
<i>I want to suck</i>
<i>every part of your body.</i>

01:42:29.125 --> 01:42:32.000
<i>I'd like to feel what you feel...</i>

01:42:32.083 --> 01:42:34.917
<i>- I'd like to...</i>
<i>- Think what you think.</i>

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.917
<i>I'd like to feel what you feel,</i>

01:42:39.292 --> 01:42:41.167
<i>think what you think.</i>

01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:43.875
<i>I want to suck</i>
<i>every part of your body.</i>

01:42:43.958 --> 01:42:45.292
<i>Nothing about you disgusts me.</i>

01:42:45.375 --> 01:42:47.125
<i>- Recently...</i>
<i>- There are moments...</i>

01:42:47.208 --> 01:42:50.292
<i>- ...I dreamed I was inside you.</i>
<i>- When I want to stop being me...</i>

01:42:50.375 --> 01:42:53.417
<i>- I could feel inside you.</i>
<i>- So I can be you.</i>

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.458
<i>You are me.</i>

01:42:55.542 --> 01:42:57.375
<i>I am you.</i>
