WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.012
In the criminal justice system

00:03.085 --> 00:04.711
sexually-based offenses

00:04.782 --> 00:06.440
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.509 --> 00:08.779
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.845 --> 00:10.537
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.606 --> 00:12.199
are members of an elite squad

00:12.270 --> 00:13.896
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.966 --> 00:15.460
These are their stories.

00:19.598 --> 00:22.446
Come on, Annie.
Just one little drink.

00:22.511 --> 00:24.877
I can't.
I smell like French fries.

00:24.943 --> 00:26.470
I love French fries.

00:26.543 --> 00:29.326
I appreciate the offer, Butch,
but my feet are killing me.

00:29.392 --> 00:32.458
I just want to take a hot bath
and curl up with my People.

00:32.528 --> 00:35.048
Maybe next time. All
right, I'll hold you to it.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.127
Mañana.

00:38.704 --> 00:41.606
I love French fries.
How stupid.

00:45.329 --> 00:46.442
Annie?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.005
Back off!
Okay.

00:57.329 --> 00:59.664
Get off me!
Let him go!

01:03.089 --> 01:05.129
Hey, come back here!

01:06.355 --> 01:08.078
Stop!
Annie!

01:14.196 --> 01:17.425
Abductee's name is Annie Tassler.
A waitress at the diner over there.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.346
Why'd you bring us
in on a snatch job?

01:19.411 --> 01:20.906
Found this on the scene.

01:20.979 --> 01:23.085
Chloroform? Dropped it in the struggle.

01:23.156 --> 01:25.939
Took off in a green
four-by-four. Witnesses?

01:26.004 --> 01:28.208
Butch McGee,
a hash slinger at the diner...

01:28.277 --> 01:31.026
and a Good Samaritan
by the name of Marty Potter.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.777
They took their lumps
trying to stop him. Thanks.

01:33.845 --> 01:35.252
There's something
I'm missing?

01:35.317 --> 01:39.028
Last summer, a guy abducted
four women using the same M.O.

01:39.094 --> 01:40.338
Raped and tortured them.

01:40.405 --> 01:42.893
Left their bodies stacked in
a warehouse in Alphabet City.

01:42.965 --> 01:44.526
The Bowery Stalker?
One and the same.

01:44.598 --> 01:46.508
I haven't heard about that guy
in a long time.

01:46.582 --> 01:47.924
Not long enough.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.846
Butch, Marty?
Yeah. I'm Butch.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.698
What do you got for us?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.269
He pulled her
right off the street.

01:53.335 --> 01:54.611
Did you get
a good look at him?

01:54.678 --> 01:56.686
He's a big guy with a beard
and a baseball cap.

01:56.758 --> 01:57.773
You ever seen him before?

01:57.847 --> 01:59.669
He might've been
in the diner a few times...

01:59.734 --> 02:01.710
but I never really
got a good look at his face.

02:01.784 --> 02:02.765
How do you
fit into all this?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.149
Saw the commotion,
tried to help.

02:04.216 --> 02:05.198
You have something to add?

02:05.272 --> 02:08.621
Yeah. He had a tattoo. A cat of
some sort on his right forearm.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.062
I saw it coming at me when
he shoved the gun in my face.

02:11.128 --> 02:13.779
If I put you with a sketch
artist, can you give us a picture?

02:13.848 --> 02:15.441
I can try.
Sure.

02:15.641 --> 02:18.008
We gotta get them in the bus.
Go.

02:18.328 --> 02:20.662
How long you think the
Stalker will keep her alive?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.865
Until he's finished with her.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:12.030 --> 03:15.739
According to Munch, the abductor
fits the Stalker's M. O to a tee.

03:15.805 --> 03:18.555
He goes after petite women,
uses chloroform to subdue them...

03:18.622 --> 03:20.597
and then carts them off
in a dark four-by-four.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.354
How long has it been since
his last attack? Almost a year.

03:23.422 --> 03:27.449
Yeah. We thought he'd gone underground,
or maybe just left the area.

03:30.239 --> 03:31.351
You're late.

03:31.422 --> 03:33.212
I was up all night
interviewing witnesses.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.767
D.A. wants an update
on the Bowery Stalker.

03:35.839 --> 03:36.984
Can't wait for the report?

03:37.055 --> 03:38.615
She's made this case
a top priority.

03:38.687 --> 03:40.792
Any warrants, lab work,
anything you need.

03:40.864 --> 03:42.206
Why all the sudden attention?

03:42.271 --> 03:45.370
She knows how elusive he's been.
She thought you could use some help.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.374
Because I didn't nail him
last time? Come on, John.

03:48.448 --> 03:51.764
Nobody's blaming you. We're
all on the same team here.

03:52.512 --> 03:54.748
Then why did you start the
team meeting without me?

03:54.817 --> 03:56.540
We were just leaving.
No, stay.

03:56.609 --> 03:58.714
I want you and Olivia
to help with the canvas.

03:58.785 --> 04:00.694
It's my catch, Captain.
I got it covered.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.869
You're still the primary but that
doesn't mean you don't need backup.

04:03.937 --> 04:06.807
Now, the only agenda here is catching
this guy before he kills again.

04:06.882 --> 04:08.059
Got it?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.721
Got it. Good. Now where's your partner?

04:10.786 --> 04:12.958
He's with a couple of
witnesses and a sketch artist.

04:13.025 --> 04:16.060
While you're waiting,
why don't you fill Alex in?

04:16.994 --> 04:19.863
Mind if I get my morning
tea first? Not at all.

04:22.274 --> 04:25.536
About a year ago, Sarah Kimmel
stumbled into a bar on Avenue D...

04:25.603 --> 04:28.026
half naked, beaten, claiming
that a man with a beard...

04:28.099 --> 04:31.133
imprisoned her as his sex slave in
an abandoned warehouse on Broome.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.204
We raided it, found a makeshift
cell in the basement...

04:34.276 --> 04:37.145
stocked with sex toys and
various instruments of torture.

04:37.220 --> 04:39.228
And four mutilated bodies.

04:39.301 --> 04:40.676
Any trace evidence?

04:40.741 --> 04:44.484
A few partials and DNA, but nothing
our system could match it to.

04:44.549 --> 04:48.226
We staked the building out for a month.
No luck. The guy just disappeared.

04:48.293 --> 04:49.504
Until now.

04:49.573 --> 04:52.540
Must have found a new safe
house. Potentially, more victims.

04:52.614 --> 04:54.719
John.
Anything on the tattoo?

04:54.790 --> 04:57.790
Butch filled in a few details.
Ran it through PIMS and got a hit.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.902
Skel named Frank Taggart,
on parole for assault.

04:59.973 --> 05:00.955
Where?

05:01.029 --> 05:04.096
PO said he got a custodial job
at the Fish Market.

05:04.326 --> 05:07.555
How desperate does somebody gotta be
to take a gig in a place like this?

05:07.623 --> 05:10.143
Worked here when I was a kid.
Made good money, too.

05:10.215 --> 05:11.645
What'd you do
with all your money?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.825
You can't tell me women
wanted to get with you...

05:13.895 --> 05:15.554
after a day in a flower shop
like this.

05:15.624 --> 05:18.373
Two words: Aqua Velva.
Come again?

05:18.440 --> 05:19.814
Fishmonger's best friend.

05:19.879 --> 05:22.914
After a hot shower slather some
of that on. Smell like Vic Damone.

05:22.984 --> 05:25.351
Smell like a mackerel
with some cheap aftershave.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.359
Hey! Munch man!

05:27.433 --> 05:29.091
Olive! Hey!

05:30.089 --> 05:31.943
Olive?
Name's Olivetti.

05:32.008 --> 05:33.350
Okay. Fin.
All right.

05:33.418 --> 05:36.167
Even when we were kids, he looked
like a big, fat Olive. Ergo.

05:36.234 --> 05:37.247
Long time, no see.

05:37.321 --> 05:40.169
We're looking for a guy named
Frank Taggart. He still work here?

05:40.234 --> 05:43.050
Yeah. As little as possible.
Where we can find him?

05:43.114 --> 05:44.128
There.

05:47.690 --> 05:50.243
Frank Taggart?
We want to talk to you.

05:51.274 --> 05:53.162
Hey, you heard the man.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.910
Hold it right there.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.023
This was a new coat.
Two words: Aqua Velva.

06:04.236 --> 06:06.408
That's a hell of a tattoo
you got there, Frankie.

06:06.475 --> 06:08.418
It's an original.
Your design?

06:08.491 --> 06:10.532
Elmo's Tats on Eighth.
What the hell do you care?

06:10.605 --> 06:13.092
Where were you last night
between 11:00 and midnight?

06:13.164 --> 06:15.204
Rusty's Bar in the Alphabet.
Can you prove it?

06:15.276 --> 06:18.027
The barstool near the door has
a permanent imprint of my ass.

06:18.092 --> 06:20.232
Feel free to check it out.
Be the highlight of our day.

06:20.301 --> 06:23.335
Am I being charged with something here,
or are we just shooting the breeze?

06:23.405 --> 06:25.991
We got witnesses that place
you and your original tattoo...

06:26.062 --> 06:29.543
outside a diner on Canal Street grabbing
a girl, and pistol-whipping her friend.

06:29.613 --> 06:30.823
I was nowhere near the place.

06:30.894 --> 06:33.381
Just like you were nowhere
near your girlfriend's place...

06:33.454 --> 06:35.046
the night you beat
the crap out of her?

06:35.149 --> 06:36.328
That was a misunderstanding.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.154
You put your fist
right through her teeth.

06:38.222 --> 06:40.711
And I did my time. And I ain't
been near the bitch since.

06:40.782 --> 06:42.277
That's why you
grabbed the waitress?

06:42.350 --> 06:44.325
Feeling the need
for a little self-expression?

06:44.399 --> 06:46.472
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

06:46.543 --> 06:50.318
I didn't grab nobody, and anybody
who says otherwise is a liar.

06:53.487 --> 06:56.073
Bartender at Rusty's said
Taggart ducked out around 11:00...

06:56.144 --> 06:57.190
the night of the abduction.

06:57.264 --> 06:59.173
Gets him to the diner
with time to spare.

06:59.248 --> 07:00.874
What about the four-by-four?

07:00.944 --> 07:02.253
Nothing registered
to him.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.848
Doesn't mean
he didn't steal one.

07:03.920 --> 07:08.044
Get all the witnesses down here for
a line up, including Sarah Kimmel.

07:09.297 --> 07:10.671
It's been almost a year.

07:10.737 --> 07:12.745
He held her in that warehouse
for two days.

07:12.817 --> 07:14.605
I doubt she's gonna
forget his face.

07:14.673 --> 07:16.299
He messed her up
pretty bad, Captain.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.897
If we get the ID
off the other two.

07:17.969 --> 07:20.969
Then we'll get a court order for
his DNA to match to her assault.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.432
If not,
she's our insurance policy.

07:31.378 --> 07:33.266
Does one of them
have a tattoo?

07:33.363 --> 07:36.778
We need you to make the
identification without prejudice.

07:37.555 --> 07:41.036
It's the only thing I got a
good look at, besides the gun.

07:47.828 --> 07:49.203
Number 4.

07:49.685 --> 07:51.757
No, five.

07:54.068 --> 07:56.109
Which is it, Mr. Potter?

07:56.853 --> 07:58.675
Five. Definitely five.

07:59.797 --> 08:01.586
Thank you, Mr. Potter.

08:04.726 --> 08:06.635
Officer Peters
will be happy to know...

08:06.710 --> 08:09.612
he's just been identified
as the Bowery Stalker.

08:09.686 --> 08:12.916
I'm sorry, Detective. It
looks like it's up to Sarah.

08:17.046 --> 08:18.421
Is he really here?

08:18.487 --> 08:21.302
We have a suspect.
But we need a positive ID.

08:23.351 --> 08:25.905
I can't. He won't be able to see you.

08:27.255 --> 08:28.782
But I see him...

08:29.240 --> 08:31.281
every time I close my eyes.

08:32.953 --> 08:37.491
I leave my lights on at night, or I'll
see him staring at me from the shadows.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.727
He can't hurt you anymore.

08:41.273 --> 08:44.273
I'm 28.
I'm living on disability...

08:44.346 --> 08:47.575
because I can't leave my house
without falling apart.

08:48.025 --> 08:50.413
Don't tell me
that he can't hurt me.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.551
I wouldn't ask you to do this
unless I had to.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.236
But we think he's hurting
somebody else.

09:10.779 --> 09:12.884
Whenever you're ready,
Sarah.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.067
You see him, don't you?

09:26.140 --> 09:29.075
Detective.
Which one, Sarah? Which one?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.886
He's not there.
It's okay.

09:35.102 --> 09:36.596
It's all right.

09:37.405 --> 09:38.747
It's all right.

09:47.775 --> 09:48.887
Sarah.

09:50.878 --> 09:52.918
Thank you for the ride home.

09:56.511 --> 09:57.590
Damn!

09:57.663 --> 09:58.907
You didn't have a choice.

09:58.975 --> 10:01.146
I was sure we had him.
What the hell are we missing?

10:01.215 --> 10:03.933
I was just thinking. Taggart
said his tattoo was an original.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.406
Right. Elmo's Tats on Eighth.

10:05.473 --> 10:09.150
I wonder how many Elmo originals
are walking around Manhattan?

10:11.264 --> 10:13.785
Hell of a work of art.
If you say so.

10:14.465 --> 10:17.498
It ain't mine. Guy brought it in
last summer, asked me to do a tat.

10:17.569 --> 10:19.991
Liked my work so much, he
left me the sketch as a bonus.

10:20.064 --> 10:21.975
How many have you done
since then?

10:22.050 --> 10:23.675
Can count them on one hand.

10:23.745 --> 10:25.501
Most folks are into Goth
these days.

10:25.569 --> 10:26.944
You keep names and addresses?

10:27.009 --> 10:28.635
It's not exactly
that kind of business.

10:28.705 --> 10:30.810
But the ones who want that one
are hard to forget.

10:30.882 --> 10:31.896
Such as?

10:31.970 --> 10:34.010
An old dude who walked
his cat on a leash.

10:34.082 --> 10:35.096
A woman wrestler.

10:35.170 --> 10:38.170
A guy who smelled like rotten fish.
And the one that brought it in.

10:38.243 --> 10:40.796
What'd he look like?
Big fellow with a beard.

10:40.866 --> 10:43.355
He said the bobcat was a
platoon name in the service.

10:43.426 --> 10:45.052
You mind if we take
that sketch with us?

10:45.123 --> 10:48.440
Why not? It's not exactly
bringing in the foot traffic.

10:51.812 --> 10:53.405
I saturated the paper
with ninhydrin...

10:53.475 --> 10:55.331
which revealed
two distinct sets of prints.

10:55.396 --> 10:57.852
One matched to the shop owner,
the other was a John Doe.

10:57.924 --> 10:58.907
Damn.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.949
Until I ran it against
the alternate data banks.

11:03.780 --> 11:07.774
"Darryl R. Kern. Dishonorably
discharged from the Army in 1999."

11:08.325 --> 11:10.300
About the same time
the attacks started.

11:10.373 --> 11:13.188
How much you want to bet DMV
turns up a green four-by-four.

11:13.253 --> 11:14.944
And a home address.

11:17.509 --> 11:18.884
Right there.

11:26.342 --> 11:28.251
Darryl Kern? This is the NYPD.

11:28.327 --> 11:30.116
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

11:30.183 --> 11:33.250
If you don't open the door,
we'll open it for you.

11:34.343 --> 11:35.390
Take it down.

11:35.847 --> 11:37.790
Police! Let's go!
Go! Go!

11:41.128 --> 11:42.917
Cool cat.
Fin.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.454
Take a look at this.
E- Z Pass bill.

11:49.256 --> 11:51.079
This guy does some
serious traveling.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.217
And always to the same place.

11:54.249 --> 11:57.544
Kern's E-Z Pass statements show
periodic travel along the same route...

11:57.609 --> 11:58.917
dating back to last June.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.287
From Manhattan he goes across
the Triborough Bridge...

12:01.352 --> 12:03.458
onto the thruway,
across the Tappan Zee...

12:03.530 --> 12:06.213
north to Utica, where he exits
on to Route 12 North.

12:06.282 --> 12:08.965
Credit cards show him gassing
up his '92 Pathfinder...

12:09.033 --> 12:12.330
along Routes 12 and 11, all
the way up to Walden Falls...

12:12.394 --> 12:15.077
a pit stop of a town 20
miles northeast of Watertown.

12:15.146 --> 12:17.732
A few days later, he takes the
same route back to the city.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.836
Seven women went missing within
a day of each of these trips.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.842
You got a lot of unspoiled
wilderness up there.

12:24.459 --> 12:26.085
There's only one way
to find him.

12:26.155 --> 12:29.570
Munch, Fin, pack your bags.
You're going on a road trip.

12:35.211 --> 12:37.733
Where's Opie?
Probably gone fishing.

12:37.805 --> 12:40.455
Speaking of which, you look a
little green around the gills.

12:40.524 --> 12:42.051
Maybe it's because
riding with you...

12:42.124 --> 12:44.329
is like taking a four hour
spin on the Tilt-a-World.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.470
I told you to take the
Dramamine. I hate pills.

12:46.541 --> 12:49.029
So you'd rather puke.
I'm not gonna puke.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.232
But you could use a road course
on driving in hazardous conditions.

12:52.301 --> 12:54.506
I kept it on the road.
Barely.

12:54.702 --> 12:56.328
The locals been briefed?

12:56.399 --> 12:59.148
Yeah. Cragen took care of it.
He faxed them the whole file.

12:59.214 --> 13:02.062
Assuming they have
a fax machine in Mayberry.

13:02.958 --> 13:06.025
Chief, the detectives
from New York City are here.

13:06.672 --> 13:09.159
Welcome to Walden Falls.
John Munch.

13:09.263 --> 13:11.652
Odafin Tutuola.
Come again?

13:11.728 --> 13:13.636
Just call me Fin.
Fin. Got it.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.653
Get you a cup of coffee?
Soda pop? Something?

13:15.727 --> 13:16.774
We're fine.

13:16.847 --> 13:19.236
So, you think you've got
a fugitive hiding out up here?

13:19.312 --> 13:22.279
Cold-blooded serial killer and
rapist by the name of Darryl Kern.

13:22.352 --> 13:24.872
I never heard of him. I know
just about everybody in town.

13:24.944 --> 13:27.432
So if he's here,
he's keeping a low profile.

13:27.504 --> 13:29.227
Come on in, Cheryl.

13:29.296 --> 13:32.494
This is Detectives Munch and... Fin.

13:33.201 --> 13:34.761
Officer Cheryl Baxter.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.386
Whatever you need, Officer
Baxter is at your disposal.

13:37.457 --> 13:39.246
We'd like to start with
Smitty's Pump and Save.

13:39.314 --> 13:41.770
'Cause that seems to be a
regular stop on Kern's itinerary.

13:41.842 --> 13:43.304
You want to settle in first,
or go now?

13:43.377 --> 13:46.128
The woman he grabbed might still
be alive. We can settle in later.

13:46.194 --> 13:48.747
Good luck. If you need anything
else, just give a holler.

13:48.819 --> 13:50.826
Thanks, Chief.
You betcha.

13:51.922 --> 13:54.160
Guy's from out of town.
Has a cabin up here.

13:54.227 --> 13:55.438
Know where?
No.

13:55.507 --> 13:58.769
But he likes to hunt, so I suppose
it's out on one of the county roads.

13:58.835 --> 14:00.691
Lots of folks
have hunting shacks out there.

14:00.755 --> 14:01.803
Was anyone with him?

14:01.875 --> 14:05.007
I think he might have a
lady friend. Is this her?

14:05.780 --> 14:08.081
Hard to tell.
You said he liked to hunt.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.424
He never really said so...

14:09.492 --> 14:12.012
but since he spends so much
time in Jordie's Guns and Ammo...

14:12.085 --> 14:13.939
I figured he was stocking up
for the season.

14:14.004 --> 14:15.631
Where's
Jordie's Guns and Ammo?

14:15.701 --> 14:17.806
Right over there.
Thank you.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.162
Yeah. That's Arnold Cokely.

14:21.237 --> 14:22.699
Cokely?
That's what I said.

14:22.773 --> 14:25.589
I heard he comes in here a lot.
Is there a law against that?

14:25.653 --> 14:27.924
No, but there is a law
against obstructing justice.

14:27.989 --> 14:29.647
Come on, Jordie.
They're okay.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.206
They're just trying
to do their jobs.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.747
What do you need?

14:33.814 --> 14:35.723
Did he mention anything
about a cabin?

14:35.798 --> 14:39.181
I think he said it was north of town.
Kept it pretty well stocked, too.

14:39.255 --> 14:40.498
With what?

14:40.950 --> 14:44.082
Rifles, ammo, provisions.
We carry a full line here.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.802
Do you mind if we take a look
at his paperwork?

14:46.871 --> 14:48.759
Yeah, I do mind.

14:53.272 --> 14:56.436
But I don't suppose there's
much I can do about it.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.352
Government's got its fingers
so far up everyone's ass...

14:59.416 --> 15:01.521
it's getting to be like
Russia around here.

15:01.593 --> 15:04.626
Russia's a democracy now.
My point exactly.

15:05.527 --> 15:08.562
I assume you checked his ID and
waited for his background to clear.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.277
Yeah. I followed the law. To
the letter, if not the spirit.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.385
We'll get this back to you.

15:16.922 --> 15:20.086
We computerized the county
records a few years ago.

15:20.155 --> 15:23.634
If either Kern or Cokely owns land
here, it'll show up on the tax rolls.

15:23.707 --> 15:26.008
Damn. How come we don't have
this kind of software?

15:26.075 --> 15:27.984
You could always
head down to the basement...

15:28.059 --> 15:30.994
and go through the big books if
that'd make you feel more at home.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.627
Just got off the phone
with New York.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.129
Benson called Missing Persons.

15:34.203 --> 15:37.881
Arnold Cokely and his wife Amanda went
missing from Tribeca five months ago.

15:37.947 --> 15:41.297
And since Cokely's ID was used in
a fraudulent firearms transaction...

15:41.372 --> 15:42.932
ATF is joining the party.

15:43.004 --> 15:47.544
That may not be so bad, considering all
the firepower Kern's been stockpiling.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.692
Sorry.

15:48.765 --> 15:50.488
No match for Kern or Cokely
in the system.

15:50.556 --> 15:53.939
She faxed a list of others that went
missing around the time of his other trips.

15:54.013 --> 15:54.995
Can you check on those, too?

15:55.069 --> 15:58.330
I'll scan the names into the computer,
have a printout in a few minutes.

16:01.918 --> 16:04.569
I still don't see why the city
couldn't spring for two rooms.

16:04.638 --> 16:07.387
Because they're cheap. The D.A.
wants to redecorate her office...

16:07.454 --> 16:10.356
with antiques and Berber rugs,
and we gotta beg for table scraps.

16:10.431 --> 16:12.153
In Narcotics we always got
our own rooms.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.716
Sometimes entire apartments.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.646
How's that?
Undercover.

16:15.711 --> 16:17.915
Gotta create entirely
new identities.

16:17.983 --> 16:21.114
You know, apartments, bank
accounts, the whole works.

16:21.215 --> 16:25.689
One time I was under for seven weeks.
Had a nice little duplex in The Village.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.931
After we bust the dope ring,
I gotta move back...

16:27.999 --> 16:30.520
to my little cracker box
one-bedroom in Brooklyn.

16:30.591 --> 16:32.927
First week home, I kept
bumping into my own furniture.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.000
So this place must make
you feel right at home.

16:35.071 --> 16:37.439
Not exactly. I got a nice
entertainment system...

16:37.504 --> 16:39.609
surround sound
and a widescreen TV.

16:39.680 --> 16:43.226
Eight months of the cold
shoulder, now I can't shut you up.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.644
So why'd you leave Narcotics?

16:48.994 --> 16:51.961
My partner took a bullet
that was meant for me.

16:53.155 --> 16:55.576
Sort of took
all the fun out of it.

16:55.938 --> 16:57.660
Why'd you leave Homicide?

16:57.730 --> 17:00.632
I came back from Baltimore
after my last marriage broke up.

17:00.706 --> 17:03.041
The only opening
in my bracket was SVU.

17:03.108 --> 17:06.205
Seen enough dead bodies, figured
the change would do me good.

17:06.273 --> 17:09.951
Little did I know, it's the living
victims that rip your guts out.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.289
That mine or yours?
It's yours.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.873
Where the hell did I...

17:16.932 --> 17:19.299
Munch. Hey, Elliott.

17:20.898 --> 17:22.209
Blueprints?

17:23.525 --> 17:25.117
Yeah. We're on it.

17:25.189 --> 17:27.012
Where's the phone book?
Right here.

17:27.876 --> 17:31.008
I used it to order the
pizza. More like a wallet.

17:32.292 --> 17:33.471
Here it is.
What?

17:33.541 --> 17:35.363
They've been combing
through Kern's stuff...

17:35.429 --> 17:39.171
found blueprints for a bomb shelter
drawn up by a contractor in Walden Falls.

17:39.238 --> 17:40.612
Cheryl? John Munch.

17:40.677 --> 17:43.875
Do you know the owner of
McCartney Lumber and Cement?

17:43.942 --> 17:45.829
Could you have him
meet us at the station?

17:45.894 --> 17:48.710
We caught a break in the case.
See you in 20.

17:49.062 --> 17:51.680
This is a federal matter.
And this is my office.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.533
Play by my rules or get out.
You're in over your head.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.534
This man has enough firepower
to start World War III.

17:57.607 --> 18:00.290
Somebody's blowing enough hot
air to refloat the Hindenburg.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.407
Who the hell are you?

18:01.479 --> 18:03.585
Det. John Munch, NYPD.
Who the hell are you?

18:03.656 --> 18:05.630
Gus Stone,
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

18:05.704 --> 18:08.290
Mr. Stone, why don't you take
your cowboys and step aside...

18:08.360 --> 18:09.735
and let the police
do their work?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.905
I have a federal warrant
for Darryl Kern's arrest.

18:11.976 --> 18:13.832
And I have someone
who could help find him...

18:13.896 --> 18:16.286
before he kills another
innocent woman. Who trumps who?

18:16.360 --> 18:17.768
Here they are.

18:24.042 --> 18:27.075
Mr. McCartney, do you
recognize these blueprints?

18:27.658 --> 18:31.040
Sure do. Guy came in last June,
asking us to build him a bunker.

18:31.114 --> 18:32.195
For what?

18:32.266 --> 18:34.949
Said he was getting ready for
Armageddon and the race wars.

18:35.018 --> 18:38.565
I don't subscribe to that point of view,
but his money's as green as anyone's.

18:38.635 --> 18:40.522
Drew up the plans
to his specifications.

18:40.585 --> 18:44.034
An underground bunker fortified
with 12-inch cement blocks.

18:44.107 --> 18:45.416
You built it?
Sure did.

18:45.484 --> 18:46.432
Where?

18:46.508 --> 18:49.923
Tract of land about 10 miles
out, just off County Road 26.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.882
Already had
a small cabin on it.

18:51.948 --> 18:54.730
I can have 10 men here, deputized,
ready to go within an hour.

18:54.796 --> 18:56.934
I've got five more
on the way from Watertown.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.893
What are we waiting for?

19:26.574 --> 19:27.556
Go.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.344
ATF.
Police!

19:40.752 --> 19:42.639
Nothing?
Clear.

19:46.384 --> 19:48.719
Where the hell is he?
Detectives!

20:00.593 --> 20:02.382
We got something here.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.521
Sorry, Annie.

20:18.483 --> 20:19.530
John?

20:29.556 --> 20:31.312
Bastard tortured her.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.580
The frozen ground's
slowing us down...

20:41.653 --> 20:45.429
but we've already uncovered 15
bodies buried in shallow graves.

20:45.909 --> 20:47.218
Three kids.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.295
Why kids?

20:50.197 --> 20:52.140
I've got my men
scouring the woods...

20:52.215 --> 20:54.157
but by the looks
of those tire tracks...

20:54.231 --> 20:57.547
I'd say Kern pulled out a
good hour before we got here.

20:58.327 --> 21:00.302
Somebody's tipped him off.

21:02.390 --> 21:05.706
I could've lived an entire lifetime
without seeing something like this.

21:05.783 --> 21:06.993
How bad?

21:07.064 --> 21:10.195
Contusions, broken bones,
flesh pulped and bruised.

21:10.647 --> 21:13.944
Mutilation pattern suggests she'd
been penetrated by foreign objects...

21:14.007 --> 21:15.534
possibly a knife.

21:15.832 --> 21:18.864
All that before he blew
her face off with a. 44.

21:18.936 --> 21:23.215
Detective? Found something in the
cabin you might want to take a look at.

21:24.344 --> 21:28.403
It's an operation manual of some
sort. Last entry dated yesterday.

21:28.473 --> 21:29.683
"Position compromised.

21:29.753 --> 21:33.234
"As long as the Worm stays in the
Apple, possibility of further erosion.

21:33.305 --> 21:36.055
"Will rendezvous at extraction
point. Operation terminated."

21:36.121 --> 21:37.877
He definitely
has an accomplice.

21:37.947 --> 21:39.320
Serial killers
tend to be loners.

21:39.386 --> 21:42.288
But when they do pair off, the
stronger personality dominates.

21:42.362 --> 21:45.079
We read a single perp because
his partner lives in his shadow.

21:45.146 --> 21:47.219
He must have left in one
big hurry to forget this.

21:47.290 --> 21:48.403
He's slipping.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.841
It says they're going
to rendezvous.

21:50.907 --> 21:53.524
The Worm's in the Apple.
The Big Apple.

21:53.595 --> 21:55.221
He's heading back to the city.

21:58.715 --> 22:00.722
It's all written
in this pseudo-military code.

22:00.795 --> 22:03.960
He calls his accomplice the Worm
and refers to himself as the Eagle.

22:04.027 --> 22:06.581
And lists targets and ops
dating back three years.

22:06.652 --> 22:08.474
I assume the targets
are the victims.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.995
And the ops...
Their torture and execution.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.687
He's killed entire families
for their credit cards and ID.

22:13.756 --> 22:15.316
He even killed
one guy for his cabin.

22:15.389 --> 22:17.244
A plumber from Brooklyn
named Ernest Dillman.

22:17.309 --> 22:19.001
Now that the operation's
gone south...

22:19.069 --> 22:22.453
he's come home to scoop up his
accomplice and hit the road.

22:23.422 --> 22:25.244
Any idea
who this accomplice is?

22:25.310 --> 22:29.139
We figure he's an Army buddy since they
communicate using this military jargon.

22:29.214 --> 22:32.923
Kern was stationed at Fort Dix
according to his discharge papers.

22:32.990 --> 22:35.924
I know somebody at the 15
close to the CO.

22:35.998 --> 22:38.268
Let me see
if I can hook you up.

22:38.879 --> 22:42.327
It's an elite group trained for
specialized tactical operations.

22:42.399 --> 22:44.920
Kern's outfit?
Mine, in the Gulf War.

22:44.991 --> 22:47.807
The closest Kern ever got to an
operation of any significance...

22:47.871 --> 22:49.976
was running to the cellar
for a batch of potatoes.

22:50.048 --> 22:51.095
He was a cook?

22:51.167 --> 22:52.858
He was trained
as a weapons specialist...

22:52.928 --> 22:54.335
but he spent
so much time in KP...

22:54.399 --> 22:56.734
we reassigned him to the
kitchen on a permanent basis.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.655
How'd he take to that?
He didn't.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.247
Kern had a problem
with authority...

23:00.320 --> 23:02.261
which is why he had a
problem with the Army.

23:02.336 --> 23:03.384
Why'd he sign up?

23:03.456 --> 23:05.878
He suffered under the delusion
we enjoy killing things.

23:05.953 --> 23:08.059
That attitude eventually
earned him his discharge.

23:08.129 --> 23:09.754
Can you be
a little more specific?

23:09.825 --> 23:12.608
We had this squirrel, used
to hang out behind the mess.

23:12.674 --> 23:15.259
Cooks would feed him
table scraps, nuts.

23:15.330 --> 23:17.184
One day,
the dinner shift arrived...

23:17.249 --> 23:19.868
to find Kern dumping strange
meat into the stew pot.

23:19.938 --> 23:22.044
When they asked
what the hell he was doing...

23:22.115 --> 23:26.457
he pointed out the window to a squirrel
hide laid out to dry in the bushes.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.222
Said he needed a new hat.

23:28.292 --> 23:31.521
One of the cooks jumped him. Kern
threatened him with a butcher knife.

23:31.587 --> 23:34.338
He wound up in the brig, where
he underwent psych testing.

23:34.404 --> 23:37.022
He was diagnosed with anti-social
personality disorder...

23:37.092 --> 23:38.302
and pronounced unfit for duty.

23:38.371 --> 23:41.535
So you kicked him out of the Army
and unleashed him on the rest of us.

23:41.604 --> 23:44.059
He did his time. We didn't
have anything to hold him on.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.237
Did he have any friends,
anyone he hung with?

23:46.307 --> 23:48.348
He pretty much stayed
to himself...

23:48.420 --> 23:51.038
except for a guy who made dry
goods deliveries to the mess.

23:51.108 --> 23:53.313
They seemed to be
on the same wavelength.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.842
Can we talk to this guy?

23:54.917 --> 23:58.333
He doesn't deliver here anymore, but I
could give you the name of the company.

23:58.406 --> 23:59.715
Some outfit out of Brooklyn.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.069
That's Marvin.
Marvin who?

24:04.133 --> 24:06.305
Marvin Posey.
He's one of my best guys.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.065
He's been with
the company eight years.

24:08.134 --> 24:10.174
He took the job the same
day Clinton took office.

24:10.246 --> 24:12.766
You ever fire the guy, you
better nail down the furniture.

24:12.838 --> 24:13.951
Where can we find Marvin?

24:14.023 --> 24:17.056
He ain't working today. He's
on National Guard maneuvers.

24:17.127 --> 24:19.199
Marvin's a weekend warrior?
You bet.

24:19.271 --> 24:21.159
Did anybody notice
today's Thursday?

24:21.223 --> 24:22.717
Sometimes the maneuvers
go all week.

24:22.791 --> 24:25.028
I don't mind. At least he's
doing his patriotic duty.

24:25.096 --> 24:28.064
Which is more than I can say for
half the lazy slackers around here.

24:28.135 --> 24:29.117
Excuse me.

24:29.193 --> 24:31.363
Hey, numb nuts! You wanna
smoke that whole pack...

24:31.432 --> 24:33.854
or you think you might make
your run sometime today?

24:33.928 --> 24:36.100
How often does Marvin
go on these maneuvers?

24:36.168 --> 24:37.990
Once a month. Sometimes
less, sometimes more.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.064
When did he leave this time?
Couple of days ago.

24:40.137 --> 24:42.308
I expect him back Monday,
if you wanna talk to him.

24:42.378 --> 24:45.225
No, we need to see him before
that. Do you have a home address?

24:45.289 --> 24:46.369
Sure. But he ain't there.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.288
He's out in the wilderness
somewhere practicing survival skills.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.526
We're gonna need
his address for our files.

24:51.593 --> 24:53.001
He's not in trouble, is he?

25:03.148 --> 25:04.226
In position, Detective.

25:04.299 --> 25:05.510
Stand by.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.879
Marvin Posey. NYPD. Open up.
We want to talk to you.

25:16.171 --> 25:17.699
Come on, Marvin!

25:23.949 --> 25:27.178
Hello. Marvin's not here.

25:27.501 --> 25:29.922
Where is he?
He left this morning.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.940
Are you friends of his?

25:35.629 --> 25:37.768
I hope you like orange pekoe.

25:38.413 --> 25:42.026
Marvin was going to pick up
some Earl Grey from the store...

25:42.094 --> 25:43.621
when he got called away.

25:43.694 --> 25:45.636
Let me help you
with that.

25:46.447 --> 25:49.414
Friends stop by so seldom.

25:50.062 --> 25:52.452
I know he'll be disappointed
he missed you.

25:52.527 --> 25:53.933
You Marvin's mother?

25:53.999 --> 25:55.755
No, I'm his Aunt Mary.

25:55.823 --> 25:58.507
His mother died
when he was just a child.

25:58.639 --> 26:00.046
I'm sorry.

26:00.111 --> 26:02.697
His father beat his mother
to death with an iron.

26:02.768 --> 26:04.939
He didn't like the way
she did his shirts.

26:05.008 --> 26:07.877
Milk with your tea?
No, thank you.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.798
It's so hard on a child
to lose a parent.

26:11.056 --> 26:14.853
That's why I was determined to
give Marvin all the love I could.

26:15.216 --> 26:16.842
Raised him like my own.

26:16.913 --> 26:19.085
It wasn't easy,
but we got through.

26:19.152 --> 26:21.292
He's always been a loving boy.

26:21.713 --> 26:24.016
Ms...
Call me Aunt Mary.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.373
Aunt Mary, it's very important
that we get in touch with Marvin.

26:27.441 --> 26:30.343
Do you know where he
might be? It's a secret.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.491
He's with the Green Berets.

26:32.562 --> 26:34.701
That's his scrapbook,
right there.

26:34.769 --> 26:36.593
You mind?
No, please.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.277
Even when he hurt his leg
on the last mission...

26:39.347 --> 26:42.959
he just turned right around
and volunteered again.

26:43.027 --> 26:44.435
How can we get
in touch with him?

26:44.499 --> 26:48.558
He usually takes his cell
phone, in case of an emergency.

26:49.812 --> 26:52.332
That's Marvin
with his friend Darryl.

26:53.908 --> 26:55.795
Do you know Darryl, too?

26:56.468 --> 26:58.126
You could say that.

27:01.269 --> 27:02.316
Damn.

27:02.837 --> 27:04.147
We had him. In our own house.

27:04.213 --> 27:07.213
He wasn't trying to stop the
four-by-four. He was trying to get in.

27:07.285 --> 27:08.299
How could we be so stupid?

27:08.373 --> 27:11.057
We weren't the only ones. Even
Aunt Mary thinks he's a hero.

27:11.126 --> 27:13.995
Aunt Mary's a few tea bags shy
of a full pot.

27:16.982 --> 27:20.277
Damn it! I should've seen it the minute
he picked Peters out of the line up.

27:20.342 --> 27:23.538
Get an APB out on Marvin and his
Aunt Mary's Chrysler New Yorker.

27:23.607 --> 27:25.036
Yeah. Got it.

27:25.879 --> 27:27.702
State Police
found Kern's Pathfinder...

27:27.767 --> 27:30.101
at a shopping center
outside of Walden Falls.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.623
They said a bald, clean-shaven
man got out of it...

27:32.695 --> 27:35.117
carjacked a mother and her kid
in a blue Taurus.

27:35.192 --> 27:36.206
When?
This morning.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.997
What direction were they headed? North.

27:39.255 --> 27:41.329
Canada. Damn.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.288
So Marty Potter
is Marvin Posey.

27:46.361 --> 27:49.874
No wonder Kern knew we were on his tail.
His accomplice had the inside scoop.

27:49.946 --> 27:51.352
The question is,
where is he now?

27:51.418 --> 27:54.101
State Police says Kern was
alone when he jacked that Taurus.

27:54.169 --> 27:57.747
A new look, car, traveling companions,
it's easy to slip through the perimeter.

27:57.817 --> 27:58.995
Maybe even cross the border.

27:59.065 --> 28:01.399
If he has, those hostages
don't have much shelf life.

28:01.467 --> 28:03.255
Got the LUDS
on Marvin's cell phone.

28:03.321 --> 28:06.835
He received a call from Annie Tassler's
cell the morning after the abduction.

28:06.906 --> 28:07.855
Kern.

28:07.931 --> 28:10.833
And they've been exchanging calls
at regular intervals ever since.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.533
Marvin didn't leave
until this morning.

28:12.602 --> 28:15.669
If they're meeting up on the road, we
could trace them through cell sites.

28:15.739 --> 28:19.034
Call the service provider.
Get a trap on both numbers.

28:20.155 --> 28:23.319
The two blips represent calls
exchanged between the two cell phones...

28:23.388 --> 28:24.403
over the past two days.

28:24.475 --> 28:27.193
Now, I've connected the blips
of each phone to demonstrate...

28:27.260 --> 28:30.162
how the signal has been passed
from one cell site to the next...

28:30.236 --> 28:33.051
which basically represents
their respective travel routes.

28:33.117 --> 28:34.523
Looks like Marvin's
hauling ass.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.148
Yeah. And Kern's
been hunkering down.

28:36.221 --> 28:39.669
Cell phones converge in a cell
site outside Fisher's Landing.

28:39.740 --> 28:42.261
Just this side
of the Canadian border.

28:45.854 --> 28:49.595
Give me the State Police. Pack
the Dramamine. We're heading north.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.532
We spotted a blue Taurus
and a Chrysler New Yorker...

29:05.599 --> 29:08.413
in the driveway of a farmhouse
about a half mile down the road.

29:08.479 --> 29:09.788
Anybody see
the mother and kid?

29:09.855 --> 29:12.092
No. We suspect they're
holed up inside the house.

29:12.159 --> 29:14.135
There's a stand of trees
lining the road.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.215
Can't see us
until we're in the driveway.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.782
Might be able
to surprise them.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.638
It's your show.
All right. Let's move out.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.938
ATF!
Go!

30:20.070 --> 30:21.116
God.

30:30.085 --> 30:31.743
You son of a bitch!

30:35.078 --> 30:36.486
He's playing us like fools.

30:36.551 --> 30:38.820
He still needs the mother
and kid. But for how long?

30:41.895 --> 30:43.935
We've got an APB out
on the farmer's pickup.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.463
Customs and Canadians
are on alert. We'll get him.

30:46.536 --> 30:48.161
How many more die
before we do?

30:48.231 --> 30:50.981
He's running out of steam.
So am I.

30:51.688 --> 30:53.760
Guess what? That was Cragen.

30:53.961 --> 30:56.098
Canadians just arrested Kern
for shoplifting...

30:56.168 --> 30:59.103
outside an auto parts store in
Mallorytown, just across the border.

30:59.177 --> 31:00.322
Shoplifting?

31:00.393 --> 31:02.084
The farmer's truck
had a bad alternator.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.941
What about...
Mom and kid are fine.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.082
They found them tied up
in the back of the truck.

31:06.153 --> 31:10.529
Provincial Police are holding Kern
until we get there, on Cragen's request.

31:16.777 --> 31:18.152
Where is he?

31:18.474 --> 31:20.547
In a holding cell.
What are you doing here?

31:20.618 --> 31:23.717
Serving the extradition warrant,
which Kern's fighting, naturally.

31:23.787 --> 31:24.834
On what grounds?

31:24.908 --> 31:27.624
Serial rape and murder make book
over shoplifting, don't they?

31:27.691 --> 31:29.698
We still have to make our
argument in Canadian courts.

31:29.771 --> 31:30.786
How are the hostages?

31:30.859 --> 31:33.478
Aside from mild exposure,
they're fine. At least physically.

31:33.548 --> 31:35.457
I'd like to talk to them.

31:40.684 --> 31:42.145
Ms. Michaelson?

31:42.637 --> 31:46.281
I'm Det. Munch of the NYPD.
This is Det. Tutuola...

31:46.860 --> 31:49.479
and Assistant District
Attorney Alexandra Cabot.

31:49.548 --> 31:50.890
How long will this take?

31:50.957 --> 31:54.274
I want to be in the hospital
when my daughter wakes up.

31:54.957 --> 31:56.364
Just a few questions.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.764
I told the other police
everything I know.

31:58.829 --> 32:01.512
The Canadians have their own
charges they want to investigate.

32:01.582 --> 32:04.038
We need to ask you about the
time you spent with Kern...

32:04.110 --> 32:06.249
before you crossed the border.

32:08.430 --> 32:11.594
Did he have a weapon when he
abducted you and your daughter?

32:11.662 --> 32:12.743
A knife.

32:12.814 --> 32:16.130
He pressed it against my ribs
and told me to move over.

32:17.007 --> 32:18.381
Where was your daughter?

32:18.447 --> 32:21.229
In the backseat.
He threatened to kill her.

32:22.256 --> 32:25.070
What happened
when you got to the farmhouse?

32:25.680 --> 32:27.884
He held the knife
to my back...

32:27.952 --> 32:30.156
and he led me
to the front door.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.957
An old woman answered and
he asked her for directions.

32:34.704 --> 32:36.745
When she turned her back...

32:37.201 --> 32:40.235
he cut her throat.

32:43.633 --> 32:45.422
What about her husband?

32:45.618 --> 32:48.235
He came running
from the kitchen.

32:49.394 --> 32:52.623
Before he could say a word,
Kern cut his throat, too.

32:53.074 --> 32:54.569
Was his buddy there?

32:54.642 --> 32:56.585
No. He came later.

32:57.074 --> 33:00.141
Kern said he had something
to show him in the barn.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.861
I heard the most
horrific screams.

33:04.211 --> 33:06.732
Kern came out
covered in blood.

33:07.155 --> 33:10.155
He went into the house,
changed his clothes...

33:10.227 --> 33:14.767
and made us get into the farmer's
pickup like nothing had ever happened.

33:15.252 --> 33:18.121
He said we were going
to Canada and...

33:23.859 --> 33:25.421
Please, tell me.

33:29.397 --> 33:33.457
He said he was going to kill me and
Jenny just like the rest of them.

33:33.526 --> 33:36.940
He said the police were so
stupid, they'd never find us.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.326
Marvin was alive
when Kern gutted him.

33:50.390 --> 33:53.074
He might be laying the
groundwork for an insanity plea.

33:53.144 --> 33:55.532
He'll never admit to insanity.
We've got the journal...

33:55.607 --> 33:57.996
and we're cross-matching
DNA samples from the bunker.

33:58.070 --> 34:02.228
But a confession would really strengthen
our argument at the extradition hearing.

34:02.297 --> 34:05.362
Tell the Provincials
I want to be alone with him.

34:16.761 --> 34:18.136
Shoplifting.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.971
Kind of an undignified end to
such an ambitious operation.

34:22.841 --> 34:24.728
Still, it was masterful.

34:25.913 --> 34:28.728
You had us stumped
for over a year, Darryl.

34:29.274 --> 34:30.900
Your operations manual...

34:30.969 --> 34:34.385
reads like a textbook in
tactics and resource management.

34:34.969 --> 34:38.516
I've offered it to the curriculum
committee at the Academy.

34:38.587 --> 34:42.231
I think the next generation of
cops can learn a lot from you.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.310
But these academics.

34:44.731 --> 34:47.447
They just want to focus
on your mistakes.

34:48.859 --> 34:50.321
What mistakes?

34:50.716 --> 34:52.690
Sarah Kimmel, for example.

34:53.755 --> 34:54.737
Who?

34:54.813 --> 34:57.660
The woman who escaped from the
warehouse. Your first mistake.

34:57.724 --> 34:59.547
That was Marvin's fault.

34:59.613 --> 35:01.173
I had to leave to go to work.

35:01.244 --> 35:04.026
Marvin swore he'd be there
in no more than five minutes.

35:04.093 --> 35:08.469
Half hour later, I get a panic call
saying that the target had disappeared.

35:09.437 --> 35:12.536
I should've eliminated
him then. Why didn't you?

35:12.765 --> 35:14.489
He served a purpose.

35:15.071 --> 35:18.486
He hooked me up with Ernie.
The guy who owns the cabin?

35:18.559 --> 35:20.218
He was a friend of Marvin's.

35:20.286 --> 35:24.313
Used to yak that it was this perfect
refuge from the liberal hordes.

35:24.382 --> 35:26.903
Got him to take me up there
during hunting season.

35:26.975 --> 35:28.982
That's when I got the idea.

35:29.568 --> 35:31.193
He never saw it coming,
did he?

35:31.263 --> 35:33.597
He was taking a leak
in the bushes.

35:33.664 --> 35:37.341
I just walked up behind him,
drew the blade across his throat.

35:37.887 --> 35:39.382
One clean slice.

35:39.455 --> 35:41.245
And Shangri-la was yours.

35:41.312 --> 35:43.646
So Ernie
was just means to an end.

35:44.353 --> 35:47.614
The trick was using the credit
cards and IDs in different places...

35:47.681 --> 35:49.622
so that no one
could trace him.

35:49.697 --> 35:51.419
Same story with the Cokelys?

35:51.489 --> 35:53.824
Met him in a bar
in Walden Falls.

35:54.721 --> 35:57.274
Said he was passing through
from Syracuse.

35:57.345 --> 36:00.029
Only problem was
he had his wife with him.

36:00.481 --> 36:02.108
So she had to go, too.

36:02.178 --> 36:04.993
Not right away,
but after a few days.

36:06.466 --> 36:07.928
Why the bunker?

36:08.194 --> 36:10.528
Didn't like to eat
where I worked.

36:11.747 --> 36:13.602
And it was more secure.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.958
How many?

36:20.195 --> 36:21.504
We found 18 of them.

36:22.916 --> 36:24.476
Oh, there's more.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.102
How many?

36:31.427 --> 36:32.671
That would be telling.

36:32.741 --> 36:34.170
You pathetic piece of...

36:34.244 --> 36:37.540
Come on, Detective. You
should be used to this by now.

36:38.437 --> 36:41.503
I've been one step ahead of you
since you stormed the warehouse.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.608
Every time I grabbed another
target, I thought about you.

36:44.678 --> 36:47.361
And when they were screaming
for mercy...

36:47.558 --> 36:50.176
I had a little laugh
at your expense...

36:50.566 --> 36:54.757
like I'm having a little laugh right
now, because you think you've won.

36:56.838 --> 37:00.581
I'm gonna have my own little laugh when
I watch them stick the needle in your arm.

37:00.647 --> 37:04.225
Canada won't extradite on capital offenses
unless you waive the death penalty.

37:04.295 --> 37:07.459
Or maybe they didn't teach you
that at the Academy.

37:10.504 --> 37:12.576
He says they won't extradite
on capital offenses?

37:12.648 --> 37:15.551
The Canadian Supreme Court tightened
their restrictions last year.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.447
So he can flip us off
from Canadian prison?

37:17.511 --> 37:19.846
He can make the argument.
That doesn't mean he'll win.

37:19.913 --> 37:21.406
He saves his neck, he wins.

37:21.481 --> 37:25.637
Look, I did not come all the way
up here to go home empty-handed.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.710
John, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.

37:35.530 --> 37:37.155
The Supreme Court
was unequivocal...

37:37.225 --> 37:38.632
in its 90 ruling...

37:38.698 --> 37:42.015
under the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms of the Canadian constitution...

37:42.090 --> 37:45.506
concerning the matter of
extradition on capital offenses.

37:45.579 --> 37:47.848
Mr. Picard,
aren't you concerned...

37:47.915 --> 37:50.403
that Canada might become
a safe haven for criminals...

37:50.474 --> 37:54.250
seeking to use our constitution
as a shield from prosecution?

37:54.315 --> 37:57.632
I prefer not to speculate
on hypothetical situations...

37:57.708 --> 38:00.741
which may or may not result
from the High Court's ruling.

38:00.812 --> 38:04.293
I can only ask this court to
interpret the law as written.

38:05.965 --> 38:07.077
Madam Prosecutor?

38:07.148 --> 38:09.188
While I do respect
the High Court's rulings...

38:09.260 --> 38:11.781
in the matter of constitutional
rights and protections...

38:11.852 --> 38:14.341
I would submit this ruling
does not apply in the case...

38:14.412 --> 38:16.616
for which the State of
New York seeks extradition.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.889
Is not murder
with special circumstances...

38:18.956 --> 38:21.346
attached a capital offense
under New York law?

38:21.422 --> 38:22.436
It is, Your Honor.

38:22.509 --> 38:25.706
However, the People are not seeking
extradition on the capital offense.

38:25.774 --> 38:28.709
We are here on the sole charge
of possession of stolen property.

38:28.782 --> 38:32.743
Your Honor, this is a blatant attempt
to circumvent the laws of this land.

38:32.814 --> 38:35.978
Since the value of the stolen
automobile exceeds $5,000...

38:36.047 --> 38:40.270
it is my understanding, this qualifies
for extradition under Canadian law.

38:40.334 --> 38:42.757
Your petition cited multiple
charges of murder...

38:42.831 --> 38:44.206
and two counts of kidnapping.

38:44.272 --> 38:46.476
It is true that Mr. Kern
and his accomplice...

38:46.545 --> 38:50.057
brutally raped, tortured, and maimed
their subjects before killing them.

38:50.129 --> 38:53.424
However, we have amended our petition
to reflect only the lesser offense.

38:53.488 --> 38:55.910
Your Honor,
this is a cynical ploy.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.799
We all know that once Mr.
Kern crosses the border...

38:58.865 --> 39:01.167
he will be charged
with the capital crimes.

39:01.232 --> 39:02.826
Perhaps, Mr. Picard.

39:02.896 --> 39:06.542
But this court prefers not to
speculate on hypothetical situations...

39:06.609 --> 39:09.773
which may or may not result
from its ruling.

39:11.761 --> 39:14.664
Now, the petition
for extradition is granted.

39:51.541 --> 39:54.224
Detectives, take custody
of the prisoner.

39:54.294 --> 39:57.676
Darryl Kern, you are under arrest
for the murders of Ernest Dillman...

39:57.750 --> 40:00.848
Arnold and Amanda Cokely,
and Annie Tassler.

40:13.559 --> 40:15.315
Welcome home, Darryl.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.617
Thanks.

40:48.122 --> 40:51.953
I just wanted to tell you, you
can turn your lights out tonight.
