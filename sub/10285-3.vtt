00:09.643 --> 00:12.480
Previously on ER:

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
I'm a third-year resident.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.717
The tube gauze is in
Exam Two, center cabinet.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.352
Thanks.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.254
In my line of work, I
see you guys get hurt

00:20.288 --> 00:21.322
and killed.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.656
So you worry about me?

00:22.690 --> 00:25.393
This disease
is invariably fatal.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.162
Well, there must be some sort
of experimental treatments.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.463
Right? Trials?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.532
But it's so quiet
with Luka away,

00:31.565 --> 00:34.202
and besides, I could use
some free babysitting.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.570
I guess Joe needs to get
to know his Auntie Neela.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.812
(Joe crying)
Aw...

00:44.845 --> 00:47.681
Come on. Come on.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.749
Aw, Joe.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.818
Eat some food.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.820
No, come on, you love bananas.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.588
Come on.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.623
No?

00:55.656 --> 00:56.590
Want some
of these?

00:56.624 --> 00:59.493
(phone ringing)

00:59.527 --> 01:00.761
Come on.
Want me to get that?

01:00.794 --> 01:03.131
Um, no, it's probably Tanya,

01:03.131 --> 01:06.534
calling to say she's
stuck in traffic.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.369
Hello.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.304
Hi, Tanya, I was just
going to call you.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.540
RASGOTRA (sing-songy):
Hi, Joe.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.476
The doctor?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.879
Well, y-you didn't tell me
he was sick.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.181
LOCKHART:
No, n-n-n-n-no.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.249
Of course, of course.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.716
No, I understand,
you should.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.154
I'll just, um,
I'll call my neighbor.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.523
Okay, let me know
how he's doing.

01:29.557 --> 01:33.894
Her kid has pneumonia,
she might be out all week.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.330
What are you doing?
I'm looking for...

01:36.364 --> 01:37.565
(crying loudly)

01:37.598 --> 01:39.467
...um,
Miriam's number,

01:39.500 --> 01:40.501
'cause maybe she
can watch Joe.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.203
Well, I'll watch Joe.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.339
I don't-- you know,
I swore I had it on the fridge.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.507
I'm serious,
I'll watch Joe.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.708
I don't need you
to watch Joe,

01:47.741 --> 01:49.510
I need to find
the friggin' number.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.878
You're having a meltdown.
I'm not having a meltdown.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.646
A meltdown involves
throwing things.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.383
This is like
a pre-meltdown.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.186
You know, sorry, sorry,

01:58.219 --> 02:00.754
I get, I get that Luka's
father had surgery,

02:00.788 --> 02:02.590
all right?
But, you know,

02:02.623 --> 02:04.892
the chemo could take, like, six
months, and we have a life here.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.594
Joe could be walking soon.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.928
Meltdown. I'll watch Joe.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.597
LOCKHART:
No, you need to rest.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.732
I'm fine, look.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.501
See?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.802
He, he-- I know
he loves me.

02:14.835 --> 02:18.606
He loves me, he
loves me, Joe.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.908
(Pratt and Betina kissing,
moaning passionately)

02:22.676 --> 02:24.678
PRATT (laughing):
Oh, baby.

02:24.712 --> 02:28.616
Oh... that was nice.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.485
Mm, yeah, really nice.
Oh, baby.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.354
(both sighing)

02:34.588 --> 02:35.623
Mm...

02:37.491 --> 02:40.628
We should get to work.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.829
Why? What's up?

02:41.862 --> 02:45.233
Nothing.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.500
(grunts)

02:46.534 --> 02:49.937
Hey... what's up?

02:49.970 --> 02:52.273
I'm fine.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.841
Come on, what?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.676
What, you didn't, uh...?

02:55.709 --> 02:59.480
Of course I did.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.649
Betina?

03:01.682 --> 03:05.953
You didn't.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.488
Okay, so I didn't.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.589
(huffs)

03:08.622 --> 03:10.724
But it's no big deal.

03:15.363 --> 03:18.499
No, no, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.601
Look, I know this is hard
to talk about, okay...

03:20.634 --> 03:22.403
Greg, let it go.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.972
But if you didn't have one,
why would you say you did?

03:25.005 --> 03:26.940
I'm a woman, it's easier.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.576
It's easier to lie?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.010
Well, kind of.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.779
What's "kind of"
supposed to mean?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.714
DAWN:
Dr. Pratt, we got
a syncopal kid over here.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.849
Go. We'll talk
about it later.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.285
DAWN:
16-year-old passed out

03:37.318 --> 03:38.552
after two days
of vomiting and diarrhea.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.421
Where's Moretti?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.922
At a conference. You and
Morris are running the floor.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.657
Okay.
Finn Andrews,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.025
16 years old, no
evidence of trauma,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.595
pulse: 122,
BP's 93/45.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.597
There's a bug going
around his school.
Access?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.599
20 gauge in the hand.
Any medical history?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.467
I'm okay.
My son's always
been healthy.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.469
All right, come on, let's go.
I'm Dr. Pratt.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.638
It's probably just dehydration
from a stomach virus.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.872
All right,
so you're not enrolling

03:58.906 --> 03:59.940
the pediatric cohort now.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.809
I got that.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.713
No, listen, this kid would be
perfect for the IGF-1 trial.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.714
You're not listening here.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.649
That's not good enough.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.984
He doesn't have six months,
okay?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.421
No, no, I want you
to have Dr. Subrin call me

04:13.454 --> 04:14.655
and I want to hear it from him.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.690
Got it?
(doorknob rattling)

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:25.933 --> 04:27.335
Sarah!

04:27.335 --> 04:29.002
Tony?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.404
What are you doing here?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.739
I ran away.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.807
What?!

04:44.585 --> 04:45.619
What's the matter with you?
I told you I was gonna

04:45.653 --> 04:46.954
visit in a few weeks,
didn't I?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.357
Yeah, but I couldn't wait
that long.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.023
You know
what could have happened to you?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.425
I'm fine.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.059
You're fine, yeah,
you're fine now.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.694
You know what?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.696
Your grandparents are probably
worried sick about you.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.698
Don't call them!

04:57.731 --> 04:59.500
Please, Tony?

04:59.533 --> 05:02.102
I told them that I was having
a sleepover at Janet's.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.004
Janet's in on this, too?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.006
I told them that we were going
to the mall today

05:06.039 --> 05:07.074
and that I was staying there
last night.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.476
Sarah, you're killing me.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.810
You know, I have to be
at work right now.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.811
I'll come with you.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.779
We can talk about it there.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.581
No, you stay right here, okay?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.417
You stay here, I'll call you
later, and we'll discuss this.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.085
Stay here!

05:18.118 --> 05:19.520
And lock the door.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.993
Copy that, 42's.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.595
Repeat vitals.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.562
All right,
we'll see you in five.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.597
Double trauma
on the way.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.498
GSWs-- belly and chest.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.032
One's a little shocky.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.801
They're cops.
Okay, clear the
trauma rooms,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.403
alert the blood
bank and the OR.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.637
Got it.
Dr. Morris.
FRANK:
ER.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.406
I got a pregnant woman
I need to present.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.073
Well, for the guy that
picked up temporal arteritis

05:40.107 --> 05:41.475
on a lady with an earache and
can do a three-layer closure,

05:41.509 --> 05:42.843
I'll hear anything. Shoot.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.144
Morris, line two.
Well, take a message.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.846
I'm schooling my
favorite intern.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.147
It's your cousin from Iowa,
he says it's important.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.782
Give it to
me quick.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.084
I got a 29-weeker with
vomiting and abdominal pain.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.487
Bolus a liter of NS, page
OB, then meet me outside.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.888
We got a double
trauma coming in.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.156
Don't tell me you got
another DUI, Johnny.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.426
Now even Randi's
not available.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.127
Well, if you're that hard
up, why don't you call Jerry?
What?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.663
Maybe he wants to work.
Didn't you hear?
He moved to Alaska.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.466
He's slinging pitchers of beer
somewhere outside Anchorage.
No way.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.434
Well, then you're on your own.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.168
No duh.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.037
I can't believe this.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.672
DAWN:
1,000 cc's in.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.573
PRATT:
All right,
let's hang another liter.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.907
Feeling any better?

06:13.941 --> 06:14.842
FINN:
No, not really.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.609
I have
a wrestling match

06:15.643 --> 06:16.677
next week.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.111
I need to
get better.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.947
Do you think I should call
his father?

06:19.980 --> 06:21.449
He lives in Ohio, but he
could get here in a few hours.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.516
My chest feels funny.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.585
You're having pain?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.487
FINN:
It's pretty bad.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.855
He's in v-tach.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.989
DAWN:
No carotid, lost the pulse.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.824
All right,
let's charge to 360.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.627
What's happening?
Clear.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.162
Still v-tach.
Starting compressions.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.798
Charge again.
Finn,
please wake up!

06:37.831 --> 06:38.766
Standby with epi.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.134
(Pratt breathing heavily)

06:44.938 --> 06:46.874
Lockhart, I need you
to jump on this!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.676
Good morning
to you, too.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.877
(tires screeching)

06:49.910 --> 06:51.011
You all right?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.046
I'm fine.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.518
We got two
auxiliary cops down.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.519
What the hell is that?
They're volunteers

06:58.552 --> 06:59.820
out of our precinct

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
without the badge.
Who's with me on this?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.491
Grady.
I don't know if this is such
a good case for an intern.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.626
It's a great case.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.894
What about Pratt?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.095
Pratt's busy
with a kid in v-tach.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.229
We'll be fine.
20-year- old female,

07:09.262 --> 07:10.698
through and
through GSW

07:10.731 --> 07:13.066
to the right upper quadrant,
90/62,

07:13.100 --> 07:14.835
tachy at 120 after a liter.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.003
How's the other one?
Stable chest wound.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.037
Larry, you're
with me.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.206
You two, chest wound.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.846
Left lateral chest.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.915
.22 caliber casing
at the scene.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.918
Vitals?
BP's up to 110
after a liter.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.252
All right, Grady,
what's the pulse ox?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.021
Oh, I don't... it's
not picking up.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.123
Move the probe.
Oh, it hurts like hell.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.991
Okay, let's go.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.795
MARQUEZ:
Systolic's 120
with the second liter.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.930
C-spine is non-tender.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.698
No elevated JVD.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.800
They let you guys
work without vests?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.536
No guns, no vests.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.770
We're volunteers.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.804
Breath sounds are equal.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.872
Will you be quiet?

07:51.905 --> 07:53.140
It's a way
for some of us

07:53.173 --> 07:55.175
to get in and
others to give back.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.544
MARQUEZ:
Hemocue 13.2.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.979
I don't know what happened.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.014
We were just walking our beat...

08:01.048 --> 08:02.950
We came across this guy.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.951
(groans)

08:03.984 --> 08:05.285
He looked wrong.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.820
Exit wound near the
inferior scapula.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.188
Grady, set up
the thoraseal.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.657
Um, right.
It's in the
cabinet.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.058
Second line is in.
On it.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.926
He was trying
to carjack some woman.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.130
He had a gun to her and he was
pulling her out of her car.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.566
Belly's soft,
non-distended.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.067
Femoral pulses two plus.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.202
They told us
in training

08:22.235 --> 08:24.204
if we ever saw someone
with a gun...

08:24.237 --> 08:27.140
...not to get involved.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.743
Hanging another liter of NS.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.712
But what were we gonna do?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.746
Grady, the cabinet
underneath the sink.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.248
There could have been
a kid inside.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.251
Who knows?
Other sink.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.020
LOCKHART:
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.254
OFFICER:
W-What's that mean?

08:41.288 --> 08:42.690
He probably has
a collapsed lung.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.858
GRADY:
X ray's back.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.959
Um...

08:45.993 --> 08:47.227
lung's down,
hemopneumo.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.762
Chest tube tray.

08:48.796 --> 08:52.032
Got it ready.
I can...
Can I put it in?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.767
Yeah.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.037
Sir, we need your arm

08:57.070 --> 08:58.606
up here like that.
Ow, ow.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.973
All set-- seven
and a half gloves.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.008
Yeah, that tube's

09:01.041 --> 09:02.309
not sterile.
What?

09:02.342 --> 09:04.177
You just contaminated
the whole tray.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.212
I'll get another one.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.047
Right. Sorry.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.082
LOCKHART:
Just keep your gloves on.

09:11.919 --> 09:12.720
Hey, Josh.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.787
Come on, come on.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.623
How's it going?

09:15.623 --> 09:16.690
The Cubs are down two
in the ninth.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.158
Oh, yeah?

09:18.191 --> 09:20.694
Columbia is enrolling patients
into a minocycline study.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.362
Yeah, did I tell you my mom's
applying to medical school?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.931
(chuckles)

09:23.964 --> 09:25.933
Listen, I talked
to the guys at Hopkins

09:25.966 --> 09:28.035
and we're trying to get
you into the IGF-1 trial.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.670
IGF-1?
What's that?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.639
Insulin-like Growth Factor.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.807
Yeah, it could, uh,
protect the nerve cells

09:33.841 --> 09:35.743
and slow down the progression
of the disease.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.077
When can he start?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.946
Soon, I hope,
I just...

09:38.979 --> 09:41.649
have to get
through some red tape.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.683
I'm... working it out.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.384
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
Yeah.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.021
All right, I have
to make my rounds.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.758
You, uh, here, take this.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.192
Keep your weight up,
keep you off the vent.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.128
Okay?

09:57.097 --> 10:00.067
(groaning)

10:00.100 --> 10:01.068
I'm in.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.870
Is Goldstein okay?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.337
Okay, widen the hole
for the tube.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.406
(groans)

10:06.439 --> 10:08.141
She caught the worst of it

10:08.175 --> 10:09.777
and she's only been out
there for three months.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.744
Okay.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.845
Aim it up to the apex.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.648
Second hemocue's 13.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.049
(groaning)

10:16.083 --> 10:17.951
It just goes in a few
centimeters, then stops.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.753
Let me see.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.388
Okay, 'cause you're
tracking under the muscle.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.090
You want to get in
between the ribs.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.758
Oh!

10:24.792 --> 10:25.726
It just doesn't want
to go through.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.960
It's all
right, relax.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.763
Use your finger
to guide it in.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.898
Why don't you just do it?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.966
No, go ahead,
keep trying, go.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.935
Oh, he's killing me.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.136
You did fine last
time with Moretti.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.138
Yeah, I know, it's just...

10:38.171 --> 10:39.372
She makes me nervous.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.908
Me?

10:40.941 --> 10:42.275
Forget it.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.844
I shouldn't have
said anything.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.781
Well, the inflammation
of his pancreas

10:47.815 --> 10:49.316
caused his calcium level
to drop.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.118
That's why his
heart stopped?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
But he'll
get better?

10:54.187 --> 10:57.858
Yeah, but pancreatitis is rare
for someone his age.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.928
It's often associated
with excessive alcohol use.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.799
I don't drink.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.101
Well, does anybody in
your family have gallstones?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.437
Not that I've ever
heard about.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.438
Whoa.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.340
Hey, wait... look at this.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.776
See this area of black?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.978
Looks like there's a cyst
in the pancreas.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.279
And it's big.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.181
Should I take him
for a formal scan?

11:21.214 --> 11:22.950
No, he's too unstable,
I don't want to risk

11:22.983 --> 11:24.752
another bout of v-tach
off the floor.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.319
Page radiology
to come do an ultrasound

11:26.353 --> 11:30.290
and get surgery down here.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.825
Good chest tube placement,
but his sats are down,

11:31.859 --> 11:32.826
he still has decreased
breath sounds.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.061
Something's not right.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.796
What would you
do, Grady?
Me?

11:35.829 --> 11:36.964
Maybe there's
an occluding clot.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.098
If we strip the tubing,

11:38.131 --> 11:39.199
it might clear
the obstruction.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.468
Yeah, good.
Do it.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.271
I think he needs
a second tube.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.272
(coughs)

11:45.305 --> 11:46.974
Sats are up to 96.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.376
Looks like it was a clot.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.278
MORRIS:
Always a good thing
to check, Abby.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.245
(coughing)

11:52.279 --> 11:54.347
Why am I coughing?

11:54.381 --> 11:55.783
Uh, your lung's
expanding.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.417
That's good.
So he's okay now?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.819
Well, if there's not too much
bleeding,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.253
we can put the tube back in,

12:00.287 --> 12:01.488
and, uh,
his lung will heal.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.123
Dr. Morris,
can't get a BP here.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.492
Okay, move him to Exam Two,
repeat portable chest,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.928
and set up
for ultrasound.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.263
(coughing)

12:10.297 --> 12:12.933
Why didn't you mention
tubing earlier?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.168
Didn't think of it
until Dr. Morris asked.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.806
I told you, you make me nervous.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.240
Well, we're gonna
have to work together

12:20.273 --> 12:22.042
without you getting
brain freeze.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.310
My brain works fine
when you're not in the room.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.045
Well, I'm going to be
in the room,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.513
so you're gonna have
to figure out a way

12:26.546 --> 12:28.315
to handle it.
Will you stop
yelling at me?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.017
I'm not yelling
at you,

12:30.050 --> 12:31.985
I am trying to teach you.
Your tone's not helping.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.286
What do you want,
to be breast-fed?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.454
MORRIS:
Abby, I need
you in here!

12:34.487 --> 12:35.889
You need to get on your game.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.890
I'm trying.
Try harder.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.358
MORRIS:
Get in here!

12:40.493 --> 12:41.494
Got a flash.
Saline's primed
and ready.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.096
Right upper
quadrant is soft,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.464
liver hematoma is
not impressive.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.166
Something else
is going on.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.202
Liver looks stable,
spleen is good,

12:49.236 --> 12:51.171
pelvic view is unremarkable.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.305
Subclavian's in.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.907
Hang a unit here.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.342
DUBENKO:
Could this be an
allergic reaction?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.409
MORRIS:
No, she didn't
get anything.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.845
Uh, set up for
intubation.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.545
Eight oh tube?

12:58.578 --> 12:59.847
Mind if I try?

12:59.880 --> 13:03.250
LOCKHART:
Don't start yet.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.384
This is Sergeant O'Malley.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.518
She runs the
auxiliary program.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.287
O'MALLEY:
Lauren and Tim are

13:07.320 --> 13:08.922
my trainees.
You guys need an extra
set of hands?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.991
No, it's crowded enough
already.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.292
Bag her up, guys.
Bag her up.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.061
Is she gonna be okay?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.195
She would be,

13:15.228 --> 13:16.396
if you guys had
given her a vest.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.331
It's not in
the budget.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.267
They're neighborhood patrol.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.369
They're just supposed to call in
if anything looks suspicious.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.871
Well, they didn't.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.105
You put them out there
with nothing.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.006
You didn't back them.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.274
You didn't support them.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.275
Not her fault, Morris.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.977
Of course it is.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.244
Would you, would you
send a soldier to war

13:31.278 --> 13:32.312
without the right armor?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.214
Oh, wait,
we did that, too.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.917
(voice breaking):
You don't need to make me feel
any worse.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.051
These are like my kids.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
Well, you didn't look out
for them!

13:48.295 --> 13:50.297
Nice work.
Whoa.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.600
What's going on?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.402
Systolic's up
to 130.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.437
Hemoglobin steady
at 12.9.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.372
I guess your crashing patient
isn't crashing.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.242
She... she was
completely unstable.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.177
When did her BP drop?
Ten minutes ago.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.412
Mm-hmm.
What were you doing?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.981
Starting a second line.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.019
It was all vagal.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.953
Wha-what?
My blood pressure dropped?

14:12.986 --> 14:14.254
Yes.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.589
Some people
get low blood pressure

14:16.623 --> 14:18.158
when they get stuck by a needle.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.127
I fainted the last
two times I gave blood.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.295
Try taking a better history
next time, Morris.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.664
I prefer not to get
stat-paged just because
a patient swoons.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.665
She was unconscious.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.500
Hey, how's Neela?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.369
Uh, she's drinking
all my coffee.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.238
Maybe I'll stop by
and see her later.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.246
He's got a large pseudocyst
obstructing the duct.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.647
It needs to be drained
immediately.
Okay.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.249
Hey, Dawn, can you
call surgery again?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.284
Right away,
Dr. Pratt.
Thank you.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.986
I'm having an operation?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
Yeah, well, we need
to get rid of that fluid.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
Actually, Dr. Pratt,
can I...?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.491
Yeah. Excuse me.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.963
Um...
Yes.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.597
These can be drained
internally

14:57.630 --> 14:58.999
with endoscopic
ultrasound.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.000
I'm between cases

15:00.033 --> 15:00.700
and would be happy
to do it.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.402
Endoscopic ultrasound?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.471
I never heard
of that before.
We did a study.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.973
And the complication
risk is lower

15:06.006 --> 15:07.440
than an external
drainage.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.242
I see.

15:09.276 --> 15:13.246
And how do I know that you're
not just faking your data?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.547
One point four percent

15:14.581 --> 15:16.449
complication rate
for endoscopic drainage

15:16.483 --> 15:20.053
versus 18%
if done externally.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.622
You're gonna let me do this
procedure or not?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.557
Do your thing.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.993
Dr. Pratt!

15:25.993 --> 15:27.995
(groaning)
32-year-old male.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.596
Single GSW
to left thigh.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.563
Get off of me!

15:30.597 --> 15:31.631
Shut up already.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.665
He shot the two auxiliary cops.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.101
Please, get me out of here.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.135
These two guys
are gonna kill me.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.269
What are his
vitals?

15:36.303 --> 15:39.072
Tachy to 118,
BP 155 over 84.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.207
Did he you give him
any pain medicine?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.341
Nobody gave me jack.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.575
All right.
Hey, Sam.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.311
I need CBC,
type and cross,

15:44.344 --> 15:45.612
five of morphine,
and bolus

15:45.645 --> 15:47.147
a liter of NS, okay?
Come on, let's go.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.217
Dawn, will you jump on this?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.584
You, come with me.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.335
Hey, Morris.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.038
This is for
that consent.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.072
Yeah.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.445
We, uh... we sent
Lauren to CT.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.184
Make sure there's no
internal bleeding.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.420
Good, that's good.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.621
Tim seems stable but,

16:28.655 --> 16:32.525
you know, we need
to observe him.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.295
This shouldn't
have happened.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.596
Lauren just started.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.067
Tim hasn't even been
with us six months.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.139
How long has the program
been around?

16:46.173 --> 16:47.707
A year.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.810
I saw it work in New York,
I thought it'd be good here.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.113
Took Lauren under my wing,

16:53.146 --> 16:54.581
Tim... phft!

16:54.614 --> 16:56.349
I found him lying
in the middle

16:56.383 --> 16:59.186
of Halsted one night,
crashing from meth.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.489
Told him to go home,
he didn't have one.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.425
When I started the program,
he wanted to join.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.327
Who better to clean
up the streets

17:07.359 --> 17:11.164
than someone who
knew them?

17:11.198 --> 17:15.167
Well, hopefully,
they'll pull through.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.103
Lieu...

17:16.136 --> 17:17.337
How they doing?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.638
The mayor's office
wants an update.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.441
Well, when Lauren comes back
down from CT,

17:21.473 --> 17:22.709
we'll want to
monitor her closely.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.377
We're gonna admit her
for observation.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.712
For how long?

17:25.744 --> 17:27.247
A couple of days,
maybe...

17:27.280 --> 17:28.681
LOCKHART:
Hey, get out
of the way!

17:28.715 --> 17:30.817
Dr. Morris, expanding
liver hematoma

17:30.850 --> 17:34.454
and her pressure
dropped again.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.423
You sure it's not
vagal again?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.791
No procedures,
no new needlesticks.

17:38.825 --> 17:42.129
Okay, uh...
get me the ultrasound.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.196
Dropped her crit
to nine.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.564
From 13?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.166
FRANK:
This is the girl's
father.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.168
Oh my God,
Lauren, baby.
Run in two units.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.602
Larry, get Dubenko
back down here.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.838
How did this happen?
She was on
patrol, sir.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.206
There was a carjacking
nearby--
Patrol?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.574
What do you mean
"patrol"?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.875
Your daughter is
a volunteer cop.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.144
What the hell is that?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.845
She's a college
student.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.613
Well, she works for us
part-time.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.449
What are you
doing?
Hanging the blood.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.483
She never told me that.
You opened your line
to the saline,

18:03.516 --> 18:04.384
not to the patient-- here!

18:04.417 --> 18:05.418
Not getting any
of it.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.519
I'll fix it.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.321
(equipment clanging)
Come on!

18:08.355 --> 18:10.157
Uh, Dr. Lockhart,
I think...

18:10.190 --> 18:12.292
Why don't you just fix the
blood and go outside and work

18:12.325 --> 18:13.626
on your charts...
No, he can stay.
He'll learn.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.794
Surgery's on their way.
Is my daughter okay?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.663
MORRIS:
Uh, the hematoma

18:16.696 --> 18:18.365
doesn't explain the
big drop in crit.
Yeah, I agree.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.400
Dr. Lockhart, I swear...
But the spleen
is intact...

18:20.433 --> 18:21.468
Is my daughter
gonna be okay?
Tachy at 120.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.602
Dr. Morris, you know what?

18:22.635 --> 18:23.870
Somebody answer me, damn it!

18:23.903 --> 18:25.172
We don't know,
now move back!

18:25.205 --> 18:25.738
Okay, come on!
Please,

18:25.772 --> 18:26.806
Sir.
Shh!

18:26.839 --> 18:28.375
Morris, look, she's oozing

18:28.408 --> 18:30.177
from her old I.V. sites.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.212
Coagulopathy!

18:32.245 --> 18:33.713
I've been trying
to tell you that.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.549
Okay, send off platelets

18:36.583 --> 18:37.850
and a DIC screen.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.452
You gotta be bold
in the trauma room.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.687
You have something
to say, speak up.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.622
Dr. Morris,
we got the shooter

18:42.655 --> 18:43.923
in the other room.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.192
Dr. Pratt is asking
for another set

18:45.192 --> 18:46.293
of hands.
I'll go.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.195
No, I'll take it.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.662
I think you guys got this
under control.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.368
See, this is why
I don't like to date cops--

18:55.402 --> 18:56.769
because you never know
when they're getting

18:56.803 --> 18:58.771
in a shootout
with some scumbag.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.373
I never shot
anyone before.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.908
Yeah, well, you should have
killed that guy

19:01.941 --> 19:03.443
for what he did
to those volunteers.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.212
Yeah, well, it's not
that easy, Sam,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.513
pulling the trigger...

19:06.546 --> 19:08.548
even if it is the
right thing.

19:08.581 --> 19:12.419
Yeah, I know.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.753
I know it's not.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.721
Yeah, they're gonna
take my gun away,

19:14.754 --> 19:17.590
make me talk to some shrink.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.226
That's just
protocol.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.229
You are gonna be back on
the streets in a week.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.831
Yeah, you're right.

19:24.864 --> 19:25.532
Oh.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.299
Sorry.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
What's up?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.369
We, uh, you have an emphasemic

19:29.402 --> 19:30.603
on bi-pap coming up
to the unit?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.638
Oh, yeah, I, uh,
I got the chart.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.772
Uh, you know what?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.874
I'll be right
back with you.

19:34.907 --> 19:35.908
Were you just sucking face
with Barney Fife?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.377
No.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.978
For information about
the shooting,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.514
you need to contact our
media relations office.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.415
Here's the emphasemic.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.450
Thanks.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.585
Hey, uh, your kid's 14, right?

19:45.618 --> 19:46.619
Yeah.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.620
I have a hypothetical
for you.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.356
Say, say he ran away,
right,

19:49.389 --> 19:50.790
across state line,
to a friend's house.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.292
Um, do you know
how much trouble

19:52.325 --> 19:53.393
that friend
would be in?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.661
Hypothetically?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.496
Yeah, just
for instance.
Oh, good.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.431
'Cause for a second I thought
maybe Sarah ran away

19:58.465 --> 20:01.000
from her grandparents and
she's at your house.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.569
Damn, all right,
we'll talk about this later.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.371
Tony, send her home.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.638
Dr. Dubenko,

20:05.672 --> 20:06.939
uh, I heard that
you did your, uh,

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
trauma fellowship
at Hopkins, right?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.477
Not a good time, Dr. Gates,
I'm really busy.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.978
You know Dillon Subrin
in neurology?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.680
Look, we got two wounded
cops, we got a shooter

20:13.713 --> 20:15.248
in the other room,
Gates.
Yeah, listen,

20:15.282 --> 20:17.617
your friend's the head
of an IGF-1 trial.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.751
And they closed
enrollment,

20:18.785 --> 20:19.752
I have this kid up
in ICU,

20:19.786 --> 20:20.720
nice kid, single mom--

20:20.753 --> 20:21.788
What happened?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.456
This time it's
for real.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.292
LOCKHART:
Dropped her pressure
and her crit.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.360
Okay, call upstairs
and tell them to
get an O.R. ready.

20:27.394 --> 20:27.960
Uh, there's
another problem.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.629
MORRIS:
DIC.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.930
She needs fresh frozen plasma
before you cut into her.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.032
I'll give FFP in surgery.
Hold on,

20:33.065 --> 20:34.567
the PT and PTT are normal.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.035
That's not really
consistent with DIC,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.605
now, is it?
Could be a dilutional
coagulopathy.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.672
Or a platelet problem?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.541
No, her count's over 300,000.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.476
She's got plenty, but they
might be bad platelets.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.345
Maybe they can't clump
and clot.
Hey, you know what?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.714
We don't have time
for a lecture on
hematology, Gates.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.816
I'll cover all the bases--
give her FFP,

20:49.849 --> 20:50.917
give her platelets
in the O.R.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.285
GATES:
That's not gonna help

20:52.319 --> 20:55.455
if it's
von Willebrand's disease,

20:55.488 --> 20:57.824
She's lacking the factor
for platelet adhesion.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.692
Are you doing
a bleeding time?
Yeah,

20:59.726 --> 21:01.861
I've seen a lot
of coagulopathy
up in the ICU.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.696
If it's over ten minutes,
then we have the diagnosis,

21:03.730 --> 21:04.931
and we can treat her
without surgery.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.434
That's all it takes.
Ten minutes.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.035
Pressure's up
after the second unit.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.937
Okay, hang another two.
You got ten minutes, Gates.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.773
(groaning)
All right.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.609
Please, just kill me.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.477
Don't worry.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.346
If our guys die, I will.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.447
Did you hear that?
He's threatening me.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.814
I didn't hear
anything.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.015
Hold still,
I can't find the dorsalis pulse.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.016
Come on, Officer,

21:24.050 --> 21:25.752
please move back!
Hey,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.487
I'm not moving
anywhere.
Benny, give 'em some room.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.489
Shut the hell up, okay?
Here's the Doppler.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.890
This guy gets two ativan,
another five of MS.
How do you think

21:30.923 --> 21:32.091
our guys feel with their
chests blown open,

21:32.124 --> 21:33.693
and blood
everywhere?
Stop it!

21:33.726 --> 21:34.994
Distal flow's
decreased.
Huh?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.363
If you die,
they're gonna fill

21:36.363 --> 21:37.464
Move back!
a hall for you?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.665
Please, get him
out of here!

21:38.698 --> 21:39.932
You're making
my job harder!

21:39.966 --> 21:41.501
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.602
Who had to jack someone
for ten dollars.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.903
Want me to call
vascular?

21:43.936 --> 21:45.705
And radiology.
He needs angio.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.907
You jack somebody for ten?!
All, right, look...

21:47.940 --> 21:48.841
Back off, Benny.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.042
Come on, man.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.411
Come on, man,
come on, come on.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.479
Get him the hell out of here!

21:52.512 --> 21:53.746
That's enough!
Stop!

21:53.780 --> 21:54.847
Stop.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.416
(groans)

21:56.449 --> 21:57.550
Whoa, hey, hey!

21:57.584 --> 21:58.985
(shouting)

21:59.018 --> 22:00.620
(equipment clanging
and clattering)

22:00.653 --> 22:02.855
Let me at him!

22:02.889 --> 22:05.392
Come on, guy.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.630
(crying)

22:12.665 --> 22:14.667
Oh...

22:14.701 --> 22:15.802
Okay, okay.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.641
Are you hungry?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.775
(crying)

22:22.809 --> 22:24.844
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.414
Mm, Joe...
(crying continues)

22:27.414 --> 22:29.081
Come on.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.784
Please, please, please, please,
come on.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.052
Okay, all right.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.621
Okay, we'll put it away.
We'll put it away.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.123
We won't have it.

22:42.929 --> 22:43.963
Lovely.
(crying resumes)

22:48.701 --> 22:51.137
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.139
(crying continues)

22:53.172 --> 22:55.442
There you go.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.111
(crying continues)

22:59.145 --> 23:01.113
Okay. Okay, one second.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.549
One second,
should we fold this?

23:02.582 --> 23:04.684
Should we fold this? Look.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.187
This dirty, dirty nappy.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.456
Oh...

23:10.857 --> 23:12.592
OR's ready.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.060
All right, let's go.
It's been over 15 minutes.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.728
Hold on, the DDAVP

23:15.762 --> 23:17.129
will increase the
von Willebrand factor.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.831
The bleeding will
stop, trust me.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.933
Times up, Dr. Gates.
Move her out, Lucien.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.969
Wait, just give me
a few more minutes.
Gates, give it up already.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.672
Look... look at the abdominal
wound-- see that?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.139
Look. Stopped bleeding.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.075
That means we have hemostasis.
Same with the liver.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.810
We've given her
the ability to clot.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.580
WESTON:
So she doesn't need surgery?

23:33.613 --> 23:35.748
No, probably not.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.216
We'll admit and monitor closely.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.151
Good pickup, Dr. Gates.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.553
Well, someone tell Moretti.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.888
Maybe he'll let me
back down here.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.490
It wasn't that good.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.798
How's my daughter?
Out of the woods.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.033
You can go in now.
Thank you.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.068
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.739
Very smooth, Gates.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.542
Well, I've learned
a thing or two upstairs.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.110
No point tenderness
around the orbit.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.078
Ice it three times a day.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.616
How did you get that?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.785
By being bold.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.054
I was bold.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.923
I'd, uh, dial back
on the boldness

24:16.956 --> 24:18.725
if I were you.
Excuse me.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.637
Hey.
Hey.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.539
Well, your GSW
is in room three.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.840
They're prepping his groin now.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.007
Thank you.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.943
So how'd it go in here?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.546
Pseudocyst is drained,
his pressure is up,

24:39.546 --> 24:41.714
and, as promised,
no complications.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.883
Nice.
Told you it'd work.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.585
Hey, Finn, how're
you feeling, man?

24:45.618 --> 24:48.054
He's still a little snowed.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.556
Oh, his repeat calcium is up.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.023
That's good.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.659
How does a kid
get pancreatitis?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.160
Who knows?

24:54.193 --> 24:56.596
But he'll do a lot better
after the anesthesia.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.599
Look at this.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.877
MORRIS:
Second chest tube is in,
oh, silk.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.011
BP's still 40.
LOCKHART:
Bag him.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.279
No more bleeding from the chest.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.081
Maybe there's nothing
left to drain.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.650
MORRIS:
I need ultrasound, let's check
his pericardium again.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.151
I thought he was stable.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.788
We were just talking.
Sometimes this happens.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.924
Blood in the pericardium.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.793
With no diastolic filling.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.728
Barely has a BP.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.597
Pulse thready.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.932
Come on, Tim.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.074
Uh, pericardiocentesis needle.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.175
What about a thoracotomy tray?

25:43.209 --> 25:44.744
SAM:
Do you want to do that?

25:44.777 --> 25:45.878
We're not going to get
the clots with a needle.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.213
Prep fast and
wide, Grady.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.915
No. No, Grady, no.
Heart rate's in the 30s.

25:48.948 --> 25:49.682
Atropine, now.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.950
(sighs)

25:50.983 --> 25:52.652
He's like a son.
I can't lose him.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.189
Wait, he's got a rhythm
and a pulse.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.091
We can still try
a pericardiocentesis.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.827
Penetrating trauma,
pre-arrest.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.862
Perfect indication
for a thoracotomy, Morris.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.230
Lost his pulse.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.031
Come on.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.299
Okay! Okay.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.346
Come on, Morris, hurry up.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.056
Abby, take it.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.759
What?

26:32.792 --> 26:34.093
You do it.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.273
(crying)
Neela's here, come on.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.076
(singing in Hindi)

26:50.109 --> 26:53.680
Come on, Joe, I don't break out
my Hindi for anyone, you know.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.081
Come on, who's at the stair?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.083
Who's at the door?
Who's at the door?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.223
Look.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.093
Lucien, what are you doing here?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.695
Hi, guys. I bought you
some wheat grass

27:08.728 --> 27:10.396
to help build
your immune system.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.231
I thought we might do
a few yoga postures

27:12.264 --> 27:13.866
for your post-op stiffness.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.301
Do you have anything
for crying babies?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.736
I don't know, do I?
(crying continues)

27:16.769 --> 27:18.871
Here. Hi, little man.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.372
Here, little man.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.176
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.912
You like planes?

27:25.945 --> 27:28.047
Oh, how about a 747?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.182
(crying)

27:30.216 --> 27:31.317
Oh, where's my copilot?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.720
(cell phone ringing)

27:33.720 --> 27:34.987
There you go.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.223
Oh, it's okay.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.759
It's okay.
This is Lucien.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.994
Oh, Dr. Subrin, yeah,
thanks for calling me back.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.930
I need a favor.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.866
County has a 13-year-old patient
with Fazio-Londe Syndrome.

27:46.899 --> 27:50.369
Yeah, I know Dr. Gates has tried
to contact you about the case.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.139
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.
Great.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.173
SAM:
Unit five and six are up.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.875
We have a pulse with CPR?

27:55.908 --> 27:57.343
Uh, yeah. Good carotid.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.878
Hold compressions.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.114
Looks like asystole now.

28:02.148 --> 28:02.949
Please keep going.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.051
Might be fine v-fib.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.286
Internal paddles.
SAM:
Charging to 30.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.290
Clear.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.127
Come on, Tim.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.963
No change.
Another milligram of epi.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.197
He's already had
three milligrams.
Then make it four.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.966
Archie.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.334
No, no, don't stop.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.302
Don't stop.
Start compressions again.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.071
Do you think we could...

28:25.104 --> 28:27.039
Concentrate
on your compressions.
Epi's in.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.908
Shock one more time.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.410
Again?
One more time.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.779
Clear.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.216
Asystole for sure.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.819
Come on, Tim.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.788
Morris, I think we're done.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.192
Continue compressions.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.427
We repaired the cardiac wound,
he just needs more volume.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.063
The heart is full.
What about more pressors?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.364
Yes, good idea.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.866
Pressors should
have worked by now.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.501
He might still
respond to, uh...

28:55.534 --> 28:57.904
Morris, he's been down too long,
it's over.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.305
Please, no.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.372
No, no, no, no, no.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.148
Morris, we're done.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.235
(stifled sob)

29:46.618 --> 29:48.420
Hey.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.957
(heavy sigh)

29:50.990 --> 29:52.258
How're you feeling?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.993
Ready for
wrestling practice.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.028
I just need to check
a few things out first.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.096
Go "Ah."

29:57.129 --> 29:58.865
Ah.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.904
All good?

30:04.937 --> 30:06.005
Actually...

30:07.506 --> 30:10.342
No. No, it's not.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.245
You're bulimic.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.014
What are you talking about?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.885
I'm talking about
the calluses on your fingers,

30:18.918 --> 30:21.320
your eroded tooth enamel,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.355
your vomiting caused
the pancreatitis.

30:29.028 --> 30:32.865
I had a buddy in high school,
he was a wrestler like you.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.600
He had the same problem.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.336
He was always
trying to make weight.

30:37.369 --> 30:40.206
Your vomiting caused
an electrolyte imbalance

30:40.239 --> 30:42.041
that stopped your heart.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.177
That's nuts.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.979
You could have died.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.081
I didn't.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.950
Not this time.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.418
Dude, it's all good, okay?

30:52.451 --> 30:55.054
I have college scouts
looking at me.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.289
So there's some things
I have to do.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.159
Everyone that's good
has to sacrifice.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.994
But this isn't a sacrifice.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.163
This is a problem.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.165
Nothing I can't handle.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.168
You call this handling it?

31:11.103 --> 31:14.573
You're never going
to get into college
if you keep this up.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.575
Is that what you really want?

31:19.078 --> 31:21.447
I want to win.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.316
All right, then we'll
get you some counseling.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.953
We'll talk to your
parents, because if you

31:26.953 --> 31:29.655
stay along this path...

31:29.688 --> 31:31.523
you're gonna lose.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.127
Trust me.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.432
Hi. Hey, good news.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.135
You know the IGF-1
trial at Hopkins?

31:43.169 --> 31:45.104
He's in.
When can we start?

31:45.137 --> 31:46.272
Soon, next week.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.040
No.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.541
I'm not going.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.578
Say "thank you," Joshua.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.982
For letting me be a guinea pig
on some unapproved drug?

31:55.982 --> 31:57.984
Hey, you're a Cubs fan, come on.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.052
You've got to be an optimist.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.088
I'm a cautious optimist.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.291
Look, honey...

32:05.324 --> 32:08.194
you want to go back
to school, don't you?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.129
Finish your thesis?

32:10.162 --> 32:12.631
Well, sometimes you have to do
things you don't want to do,

32:12.664 --> 32:15.167
so you get what
you want in the end.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.710
You think they have
Wi-Fi in Baltimore?

32:24.743 --> 32:27.146
I bet they do.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.180
Fine.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.282
Thank you.

32:30.316 --> 32:33.485
Thank you, Tony.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.653
Hello?
This is about me.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.255
(chuckles)

32:36.288 --> 32:38.190
Come on, this is gonna
be good, I promise.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.192
All right?

32:45.531 --> 32:46.532
Hey.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.466
Hey.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.301
You talk to him?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.070
Yeah, but I need
to call Psych.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.638
Look, about this morning.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.473
(quiet laugh)

32:54.506 --> 32:57.343
You never struck me as someone
with self-esteem issues.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.478
I'm not.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.647
Oh. Well, you think
it's okay for a man

33:01.680 --> 33:05.417
to get what he wants
and you get nothing?

33:05.451 --> 33:08.654
Look, you know,

33:08.687 --> 33:11.423
I've jumped through a lot
of hoops for you.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.160
I've asked you out the way
you wanted me to ask you out.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.262
I call you when
you want me to call you,

33:16.295 --> 33:18.697
but I'm not
a mind reader.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.732
Now, if we're going
to do this,

33:20.766 --> 33:23.069
we're going to have
to do this together.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.237
Next time I will
tell you if I don't.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.438
Well, that would help.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.507
Hell, you speak up
about everything else.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.776
Guess you're right.

33:30.809 --> 33:35.181
So, dinner... tonight?

33:35.214 --> 33:36.715
Sounds good.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.485
You mean that,
or are you just faking?

33:45.757 --> 33:46.825
Oh.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.628
(laughs)

33:49.661 --> 33:51.697
(chuckles)

33:51.730 --> 33:54.266
You believe me now?

33:54.300 --> 33:55.201
Oh.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.602
(chuckles)

34:00.806 --> 34:02.708
(clears throat)

34:17.623 --> 34:20.226
Is there any family
I can call?

34:20.259 --> 34:22.228
No.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.329
I'm all he's got.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.197
(sniffles)

34:26.232 --> 34:29.467
Well, he's going
to be here for a
little while longer,

34:29.501 --> 34:32.670
but then we're going to
have to move him, but...

34:32.704 --> 34:35.274
you can stay
until we do.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.577
What about the jerk
who did this?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.612
Is he going to make it?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.616
He's upstairs right now,

34:44.650 --> 34:47.453
but, uh, tomorrow he'll be
transferred to the jail ward.

34:49.721 --> 34:53.359
You know,
I see kids die a lot.

34:55.393 --> 34:58.430
Way more than I should.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.633
Just this year, we have had
more young people get shot

35:01.667 --> 35:03.669
than God knows when.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.439
But he...

35:07.473 --> 35:10.242
After everything
that happened to him

35:10.276 --> 35:13.345
when he was a kid,
he was trying to help.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.887
Do you think
he died in pain?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.255
No.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.592
Good.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.463
He'd been through enough.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.368
(cries)

35:43.275 --> 35:44.310
DUBENKO:
Breathe in...

35:44.343 --> 35:45.677
(Rasgotra inhales)

35:45.711 --> 35:46.945
And out.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.547
(Rasgotra exhales)

35:48.580 --> 35:51.517
And in... and out.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.752
(inhaling
and exhaling)

35:55.754 --> 35:57.889
(inhaling)

35:57.923 --> 35:59.391
(exhales)

36:02.828 --> 36:03.929
Wow.

36:03.962 --> 36:04.830
I do feel better.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.365
(clears throat)
Yeah?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.467
There's so much
healing yoga can do.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.236
Western medicine
isn't everything.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.737
You know, when I get better,
I might take a class.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.605
Well, they have
them in the morning

36:13.639 --> 36:17.409
in the anesthesia conference
rooms, Mondays and Wednesdays.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.845
Thanks.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.781
Hey, um, Neela,

36:22.814 --> 36:24.616
about what happened
at the wedding...

36:24.650 --> 36:25.984
Oh, Lucien, we were both drunk.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.755
Let me just finish.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.725
I... I may have
gotten my fondness

36:33.759 --> 36:37.496
and... respect for you

36:37.529 --> 36:42.368
confused with
something else.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.602
And I hope you can forgive

36:43.635 --> 36:47.939
my, uh... inappropriateness.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.908
Oh, my God.

36:49.941 --> 36:50.842
(sighs)
Did I do it again?

36:50.876 --> 36:52.811
Where's Joe?

36:53.979 --> 36:56.782
RAGOSTRA:
Oh...

36:56.815 --> 36:58.884
He's walking.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.286
(babbles)

37:00.319 --> 37:00.886
Abby will be so...

37:00.919 --> 37:02.454
Pissed off.

37:02.488 --> 37:03.722
She missed it.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.762
Hey.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.598
What are you
doing out here?

37:12.631 --> 37:14.900
I figured you'd be home soon,
and we'd get something to eat.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.735
All right.
What do you want?

37:16.768 --> 37:19.538
Chinese.
Chinese it is.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.673
Can we go
to the movies after?

37:21.707 --> 37:23.309
No. After we have
Chinese food,

37:23.309 --> 37:25.977
I'm going to take you
back to Wisconsin.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.314
What?

37:31.550 --> 37:34.052
You changed your mind,
didn't you?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.053
You don't want
custody of me.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.989
Yes, I do.
Come on.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.791
Sarah, sometimes...

37:39.825 --> 37:42.628
Sometimes you have to do things
you don't want to do

37:42.661 --> 37:45.497
so you can get
what you want in the end.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.366
What is that supposed to mean?

37:47.399 --> 37:49.435
Well, I'm trying to make it
so we live together forever,

37:49.468 --> 37:52.438
but if you keep running away,
that's not going to happen.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.741
You got to work
with me here.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.951
I guess we should
probably call them.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.420
I already did.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.390
Chinese?

38:11.423 --> 38:13.425
Yeah.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.594
I'll race you.
Come on.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.370
Grady, wait up!

38:24.370 --> 38:26.071
(sighs)

38:26.104 --> 38:28.073
15,000 people
die every day.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.040
He was not supposed
to be one of them.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.442
It wasn't your fault.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.577
I should have been
thinking tamponade.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.679
No, you shouldn't.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.381
The trajectory was
nowhere near the heart,

38:35.414 --> 38:36.882
and the first scan showed
a normal pericardium.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.016
I should have
monitored him.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.418
We were
monitoring him.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.919
I just want to go home.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.788
No, you just need to
relax in there, okay?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.022
And pay attention
to the details.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.724
If the ER feels
too overwhelming,

38:45.757 --> 38:46.825
don't worry about it,
it's going to get better.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.093
I want to go out
with you.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.965
Ever since I mistook you
for an intern,

38:53.999 --> 38:57.569
I've been thinking
about it.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.405
How about dinner?

38:59.405 --> 39:00.005
A movie, a drink
at Ike Ryan's?

39:00.038 --> 39:02.908
I'm married.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.710
You're what?

39:04.743 --> 39:05.877
It's a ring.

39:05.911 --> 39:09.415
Husband. I'm married.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.417
Oh, God, I am such a rube.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.422
It's the details, Grady.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.490
It could save
somebody's life.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.694
Maybe get you a date.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.064
Go home.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.460
Jim's getting full honors.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.695
Well, at least
there's that.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.996
What happened to
you in there?

40:01.833 --> 40:04.436
My dad died.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.871
What?!

40:05.904 --> 40:07.439
Yeah.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.578
I got the call this morning
before those cops came in.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.912
Well, why didn't
you say something?

40:13.945 --> 40:16.715
We could have
covered for you.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.783
What was there to say?

40:17.816 --> 40:19.117
My-My cousin called.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.653
He said...

40:21.687 --> 40:26.191
my dad was in the hospital
for a week and keeled over.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.559
You didn't know he was sick?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.863
You mean, does my family talk?

40:34.833 --> 40:38.470
Did my dad say,

40:38.504 --> 40:40.005
"Call my son,

40:40.038 --> 40:41.172
I want him by my side."?

40:41.206 --> 40:43.942
No. No.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.878
That's not the way
the Morris family does things.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.152
You know, everything I ever did

40:54.185 --> 40:56.187
was to prove him wrong.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.589
Everything.

41:00.058 --> 41:03.128
He-He said, uh, he was wasting
his money on medical school

41:03.161 --> 41:07.899
because he thought
I'd never pass, but I did.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.868
He said I'd never find a job
at a good hospital,

41:09.901 --> 41:10.902
and I did that.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.541
You know,
I had this plan...

41:18.910 --> 41:22.648
(crying):
...to-to pass the boards
in a few weeks and...

41:24.115 --> 41:27.686
...and go tell him
and say, "Look, I did it...

41:27.719 --> 41:28.920
"you big dummy!

41:28.954 --> 41:30.889
I'm a specialist!"

41:30.922 --> 41:32.924
(sighs)

41:34.926 --> 41:37.195
But it's too late.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.230
Yeah.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.869
He's still laughing at me.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.576
Oh, Morris,
I'm sure he was proud.

41:50.576 --> 41:53.945
I mean, maybe he just...
didn't know how to say it.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.916
No.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.951
No, he's laughing.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.723
I can still hear him.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.958
He's laughing.
