WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:02.300
Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

00:02.301 --> 00:06.104
Our guest today is the 1994
illinois state champion

00:06.105 --> 00:08.339
For husband-calling.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.575
For those of you who
don't know what that is,

00:10.576 --> 00:14.813
It is a contest to see
who can call their
spouse the loudest.

00:14.814 --> 00:18.817
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a big, warm
welcome to deb selby.

00:24.456 --> 00:26.290
Welcome to the show, deb.
Thanks, tim.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.959
Can you tell us something

00:27.960 --> 00:29.928
About a husband-
calling contest?

00:29.929 --> 00:32.831
A husband-calling contest
is like a hog-calling contest,

00:32.832 --> 00:36.334
Only in this case
the hog is your husband.

00:36.335 --> 00:39.537
Ok, let me try
to get this straight.

00:39.538 --> 00:42.540
Your husband's out
in the back 40
in the pole barn,

00:42.541 --> 00:44.542
Greasing up a chassis
on an old tractor.

00:44.543 --> 00:46.177
You want to get
his attention,
what do you do?

00:46.178 --> 00:49.014
I holler at him
like this.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.650
<i>(shouts)</i> steven!

00:51.651 --> 00:54.252
Hubba-bubba-bubba-
bubba-bubba!

00:54.253 --> 00:55.954
Husband, I love you!

00:55.955 --> 00:59.758
Steven, get in here
right now!

01:04.462 --> 01:07.265
So, uh, how long

01:07.266 --> 01:11.936
Have you and <i>(shouts)</i>
<i>steven...</i> Been married?

01:11.937 --> 01:15.106
11 years.
That's my husband steve
sitting up in the audience.

01:15.107 --> 01:16.741
Hey, steve.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.711
You're married 11 years,
you still can't
tune her out?

01:19.712 --> 01:21.746
Huh?

01:21.747 --> 01:24.415
I can tune out
any woman any time

01:24.416 --> 01:25.616
As long as I'm
watching sports.

01:25.617 --> 01:27.285
My wife can be yelling
right in my ear.

01:27.286 --> 01:29.587
I can watch sports.
I can come out with
the scores, everything.

01:29.588 --> 01:31.589
Would you like
to prove that?
Sure.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.692
Bring out the sports
channel, see if he
can tune out deb.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.660
What do you think about
that challenge, huh?

01:35.661 --> 01:37.128
Yeah!

01:37.129 --> 01:38.997
Heidi, bring out the tv.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.466
Here you go, tim.

01:43.468 --> 01:45.636
There you go, tim.
Pga golf.

01:45.637 --> 01:48.439
<i>(tv commentator)</i>
<i>he's two strokes back</i>
<i>on the leader...</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:51.109
<i>(shouts)</i> timmy!

01:51.110 --> 01:54.445
Timmy, timmy,
timmy, timmy, timmy!

01:54.446 --> 01:56.347
Timmy!

01:56.348 --> 01:59.184

timmy, timmy, timmy!

01:59.185 --> 02:01.252

02:01.253 --> 02:04.155
Here, timmy, timmy,
timmy, timmy, timmy!

02:06.258 --> 02:07.926
All right, tim.

02:07.927 --> 02:09.560
Well, what did
the announcer say?

02:11.597 --> 02:14.365
What?

02:14.366 --> 02:16.768
The announcer -
what did he say?

02:16.769 --> 02:18.436
This always happens
to steve.

02:18.437 --> 02:20.304
He gets a ringing
in his ears.

02:22.441 --> 02:25.744
You're not singing
in my rear.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.612
Timmy!

02:27.613 --> 02:30.215
Here, timmy, timmy,
timmy, timmy, timmy!

03:17.462 --> 03:21.432
94, 95, 196 galvanized nails.

03:21.433 --> 03:24.102
Al, who cares
how many nails we got?

03:24.103 --> 03:25.770
To run
an efficient business,

03:25.771 --> 03:28.039
You should have
an accurate inventory.

03:35.981 --> 03:39.117
When was the last time
you counted everything
in this store?

03:39.118 --> 03:43.254
Oh, let's see.
Including yesterday, never.

03:44.790 --> 03:48.392
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten...

03:48.393 --> 03:50.228
13, 12...
Don't.

03:50.229 --> 03:54.065
...28, 105, 40.
<i>(laughs)</i>

03:54.066 --> 03:57.635
What's up, harry?
Hey, guys.
How are you doing?

03:57.636 --> 03:59.470
Hey, mark. Hi.

03:59.471 --> 04:01.572
So what can I do
for you today, tim?

04:01.573 --> 04:02.874
What?

04:05.911 --> 04:08.279
You still having trouble
with your hearing?

04:08.280 --> 04:11.149
Herring? I hate fish.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.751
When did you start
selling fish? Ew!

04:13.752 --> 04:16.721
The doctor said
his hearing will be
coming back any day.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.857
Yeah, we came here
to get a hacksaw blade.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.423
Oh. Aisle three.

04:20.425 --> 04:22.626
What?
Aisle three.

04:22.627 --> 04:25.897
So go pee.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.266
Are the hacksaw blades
where they usually are?

04:29.501 --> 04:31.435
Check out
this swiss army knife.

04:31.436 --> 04:33.037
You know what
that thing is?

04:33.038 --> 04:35.106
That's a swiss army knife.

04:37.776 --> 04:41.512
Wow! It's got
a magnifying glass,
corkscrew, can opener...

04:41.513 --> 04:43.647
That's right.
Tweezers and a nail file.

04:43.648 --> 04:47.785
Yeah, for al's
mid-afternoon pedicure.

04:47.786 --> 04:50.188
I'd give anything
to have a knife this cool.

04:50.189 --> 04:54.359
Yeah, me too,
but where are we
gonna get 95 bucks?

04:54.360 --> 04:56.961
We could sell mark.
Hey!

04:56.962 --> 04:59.364
Where are we gonna get
the other 90?

05:00.900 --> 05:03.201
Harry, I'll just take
this one here.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.636
Gotta run - gotta get
the boys to soccer practice.

05:05.637 --> 05:07.405
Ok, I'll put it on your tab.

05:07.406 --> 05:11.675
I don't need a cab.
I got a car right out front.

05:11.676 --> 05:13.444
I'm gonna
charge you double.

05:13.445 --> 05:15.079
You're right.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.548
Al does look like
barney rubble.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.592
Hi, tim. Did you get
your hearing back?

05:28.593 --> 05:30.594
What?
Did you get
your hearing back?

05:30.595 --> 05:32.763
Yes, I got my hearing back.
Is al here?

05:32.764 --> 05:35.466
I think he's backstage.
Are you gonna need
your cutters?

05:35.467 --> 05:37.302
Both sets, please.
Ok.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.503
<i>(imitates</i> <i>deb)</i> albert!

05:39.504 --> 05:42.006
Albert, albert,
albert, albert!

05:43.875 --> 05:45.876
What's the matter?
Nothing.

05:45.877 --> 05:48.980
I was just practicing
for next year's
sidekick-calling contest.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.951
Uh, actually, tim,
there's something

05:52.952 --> 05:54.618
I need to talk
to you about.

05:54.619 --> 05:56.487
It's about yesterday.

05:56.488 --> 05:58.456
After you left
the hardware store,

05:58.457 --> 06:01.059
I noticed a little
something was missing.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.626
Thank you, al.

06:02.627 --> 06:05.729
I do kind of light up
a hardware store, don't I?

06:05.730 --> 06:08.399
I... Actually, you know
that swiss army knife

06:08.400 --> 06:10.101
Your boys were admiring?

06:10.102 --> 06:11.402
Yeah.

06:11.403 --> 06:12.636
It's gone.

06:16.408 --> 06:18.742
You're not suggesting
one of my boys
stole it, are you?

06:18.743 --> 06:21.412
No.

06:21.413 --> 06:24.515
But knives don't just get up
and walk off on their own.

06:24.516 --> 06:27.452
Well, maybe harry stole it.

06:29.254 --> 06:32.190
Why would harry steal
a pocketknife
from his own store?

06:32.191 --> 06:34.859
To collect the insurance.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.264
You know, this was not
easy for me to bring up.

06:40.265 --> 06:44.369
And I turned that store
upside down looking
for that darn thing,

06:44.370 --> 06:45.870
And, well, the fact is,

06:45.871 --> 06:47.605
It was there when
you guys came in,

06:47.606 --> 06:49.607
And when you left...
It was gone.

06:49.608 --> 06:51.109
I know kids steal things,

06:51.110 --> 06:53.177
But my boys steal from
you and harry? Come on.

06:53.178 --> 06:55.013
Things like that happen.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.282
Let me tell you a story
about my uncle's
grocery store.

06:58.283 --> 06:59.950
I was holding
my mother's hand...

06:59.951 --> 07:01.619
And this was yesterday?

07:02.921 --> 07:06.024
I was seven years old.
Oh.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.826
And she went off to look
for the children's
appetite suppressant...

07:10.396 --> 07:12.763
And...

07:12.764 --> 07:16.901
On the shelf
there was a cookie.

07:16.902 --> 07:19.870
And I stole it and I ate it.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.746
Ok, so you're saying

07:28.747 --> 07:32.250
You think one of my kids
ate that knife?

07:38.323 --> 07:40.425
Hi, sweetie.
How was your day?

07:40.426 --> 07:42.927
Where are the boys?
Outside.

07:42.928 --> 07:45.430
And how was my day?
It was great.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.265
I went to school.
It was real interesting.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.933
I don't see them.
I came home.
I washed the floor.

07:48.934 --> 07:52.770
I did the laundry.
I had an affair.

07:52.771 --> 07:56.774
Who are you talking to?
Evidently myself.

07:56.775 --> 07:58.609
Al thinks one of the boys
might have stolen

07:58.610 --> 08:01.112
A knife from
the hardware store.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.448
Why would they steal
a knife?

08:03.449 --> 08:05.849
Not a knife.
A swiss army knife.

08:05.850 --> 08:09.387
This is the reason
the swiss army is
the force they are today.

08:11.056 --> 08:14.258
It's got a magnifying glass,
a corkscrew, a toothpick.

08:14.259 --> 08:16.394
In case they get attacked
by wine stewards

08:16.395 --> 08:19.430
With spinach
in their teeth?

08:19.431 --> 08:22.066
Is this funny to you?
Yeah.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.001
Boys, come in here.
I wanna talk to you.

08:24.002 --> 08:25.503
We'll be there in a sec.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.771
You really think
our boys would steal
something from al?

08:27.772 --> 08:29.773
No, but al does, and he's
not the type of guy

08:29.774 --> 08:31.375
That goes around
accusing people.

08:31.376 --> 08:34.578
Yo, dad, what's going on?
Settle up for a minute.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.914
Um... Al couldn't find
that swiss army knife

08:37.916 --> 08:39.583
You guys were looking at
yesterday.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.919
Do you have any idea
who might have taken it?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.421
You know,
maybe harry took it.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.724
To collect
the insurance money.

08:46.725 --> 08:49.293
Where do you
come up with these ideas?

08:52.498 --> 08:55.433
Nobody's accusing anybody
of anything, but...

08:55.434 --> 08:57.435
If you know anything
about this,

08:57.436 --> 08:59.437
This is a good time
to tell us what you know.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.372
I know I didn't take it.

09:01.373 --> 09:03.608
Me either.
Wasn't me.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.477
Brad, you've always wanted
one of these things.

09:06.478 --> 09:10.047
Yeah. So has randy.
If somebody took it,
it was probably him.

09:10.048 --> 09:11.715
Yeah, right.
You're the thief.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.551
You're the one who took
dad's hot rod magazine

09:13.552 --> 09:16.420
With the babes
on the cover.

09:16.421 --> 09:20.791
What? <i>The bevy</i>
<i>of beauties from chevy?</i>
You got that issue?

09:20.792 --> 09:25.363
Well, randy took mom's
victoria's secret catalog.

09:26.731 --> 09:30.134
That's mine too.

09:32.504 --> 09:35.273
Can we get back
to the knife?

09:35.274 --> 09:36.940
Look, we didn't take it,
all right?

09:36.941 --> 09:38.842
How many times
do we have to tell you?

09:38.843 --> 09:42.180
Fine. Ok, fine.
Just go back outside.
It's all right.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.015
Do we believe 'em?

09:45.016 --> 09:46.584
I hope
they didn't take it.

09:46.585 --> 09:48.386
They said
they didn't take it.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.454
Will you make yourself useful?
I gotta take this upstairs.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.256
Yeah, but do we trust
the kids that would take

09:52.257 --> 09:54.325
Their dad's
victoria's secret catalog?

09:54.326 --> 09:56.427
I'm more worried that
their dad is the one <i>getting</i>

09:56.428 --> 10:00.264
The victoria's secret
catalog.

10:00.265 --> 10:02.933
What are you wearing
under there?

10:02.934 --> 10:05.903
A beautiful camisole
and a silk thong.

10:10.775 --> 10:13.277
The only reason I buy
those magazines is
to read the articles.

10:13.278 --> 10:14.579
Right.

10:16.147 --> 10:19.116
You know,
if anybody stole that,
it was probably brad.

10:19.117 --> 10:21.819
Except you notice randy
couldn't even look me
right in the eye?

10:21.820 --> 10:24.788
That's 'cause you got
some schmutz on your nose.

10:24.789 --> 10:27.958
Schmutz?
Yeah. Schmutz.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.298
What are you doing?
Dusting.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.799
In a drawer?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.802
Very dusty in here.
Look at this.

10:38.803 --> 10:41.138
You are searching
their rooms.

10:41.139 --> 10:42.806
I'm not gonna stand by
and let you do that.

10:42.807 --> 10:44.808
That is an invasion
of the boys' privacy.

10:44.809 --> 10:46.810
My mother used to do that
to me when I was growing up.

10:46.811 --> 10:48.312
I really, really,
really hated it.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.114
The way she did it
was so sneaky, too.

10:50.115 --> 10:53.651
What did she do?
Maybe there's something
she did we could use.

10:53.652 --> 10:57.288
No. It was really stupid.
I'd catch her looking
in my desk drawer,

10:57.289 --> 11:00.258
And she'd pretend
that she was putting
my underwear away.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.925
No. If I start searching
their rooms,

11:01.926 --> 11:04.094
I might as well turn
right into my mother.

11:08.433 --> 11:11.101
Don't even joke about that.

11:11.102 --> 11:13.771
I am not gonna become
a snoopy parent

11:13.772 --> 11:16.240
Who doesn't trust
their kids. Tim!

11:17.609 --> 11:19.443
Oh, man. I keep
telling mark not to put

11:19.444 --> 11:21.479
His dirty laundry
back into his drawer.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.547
A lot of guys do that.

11:26.918 --> 11:29.487
Especially guys
who just stole
a pocket knife.

11:36.161 --> 11:38.862
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll handle this.

11:38.863 --> 11:40.331
Hi, mark.
Hi.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.965
Having an apple?
Yeah.

11:41.966 --> 11:43.634
I like apples
when they're peeled,

11:43.635 --> 11:45.303
But to peel an apple,
what would you need?

11:45.304 --> 11:47.137
You'd need a knife,
wouldn't you?

11:47.138 --> 11:49.473
Mm, boy. Oh, wait a minute,
I got one.

11:49.474 --> 11:52.576
I'll just peel that for you.
Use this knife here, huh?

11:52.577 --> 11:54.878
Oh, maybe
I'll have a banana.

11:54.879 --> 11:57.715
Maybe you'll sit down.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.418
Mark, we found the knife
in your pants pocket.

12:00.419 --> 12:04.221
Why did you do this?
What do you have to say?

12:04.222 --> 12:06.089
Who cares
what he has to say?

12:06.090 --> 12:07.891
He stole something,
then he lied about it.

12:07.892 --> 12:10.528
You let me yell
at your brothers
and take the rap for you.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.262
You're grounded
indefinitely now.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.198
Tim, wait.

12:14.199 --> 12:16.266
Before you start
doling out the punishment,

12:16.267 --> 12:18.268
I think that you and I
should discuss this first.

12:18.269 --> 12:19.970
I'm with mom.

12:19.971 --> 12:21.939
You stole from
two of my best friends.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.808
They're like family to me.
Is this how you treat
these guys?

12:23.809 --> 12:27.077
Dad, I'm sorry.
Forget about sorry!
It doesn't work right now!

12:27.078 --> 12:28.846
Just calm down.
Stop yelling.

12:28.847 --> 12:31.515
I've a right to yell.
My kid's a rotten
little thief.

12:31.516 --> 12:33.116
That's what you've
turned into-
wait a second.

12:33.117 --> 12:35.152
Where are you going?
I'm not finished yet!

12:35.153 --> 12:38.422
How could you do that?
You called your own son
a rotten little thief.

12:38.423 --> 12:40.791
That's what he is.
He is not rotten.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.793
He's never done anything
even remotely like this.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.795
You didn't have to scream.
You scared him half to death.

12:44.796 --> 12:47.030
Maybe that's good.
Next time he thinks about
stealing something,

12:47.031 --> 12:48.499
He's gonna think
twice about it.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.968
I hate when you do this.

12:50.969 --> 12:52.837
The kids do something,
you overreact...

12:52.838 --> 12:56.440
No, you underreact.
I do not underreact.
You go overboard.

12:56.441 --> 13:00.478
You go underboard.
There's no such word
as "underboard."

13:03.515 --> 13:05.416
And since when are you
the only one

13:05.417 --> 13:07.084
That makes decisions
around here?

13:07.085 --> 13:08.919
I thought we were in this
parenting thing together.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.421
Somebody had to deal out
punishment,

13:10.422 --> 13:11.922
And it certainly wasn't
gonna be you.

13:11.923 --> 13:14.091
Oh, I see. So you deal
out the punishment,

13:14.092 --> 13:16.694
And then I'm the one
who has to stay home
and enforce it?

13:16.695 --> 13:19.129
You wanna work together?
That's your part.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.968
That is one of the stupidest
things you've ever said.

13:24.969 --> 13:27.938
So what am I supposed to do?
Quit work, stay home,
and enforce his grounding?

13:27.939 --> 13:30.541
No, I just want you to
think about what you say
before you say it.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.976
And if it's not
the right thing to say,
then don't say it at all.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.951
Could you say that again?

13:40.952 --> 13:43.086
<i>(knock at door)</i>

13:48.460 --> 13:49.794
Can I come in?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.095
No.

13:52.096 --> 13:54.432
Honey, I want
to talk to you.

13:56.668 --> 13:59.336
Look...

13:59.337 --> 14:01.672
What you did was wrong.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.741
But your father came down
on you kind of hard,

14:03.742 --> 14:05.409
And I thought
you might be upset.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.078
I'm not upset.

14:08.079 --> 14:12.082
Well, I'd be upset if somebody
yelled at me like that.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.752
You know, my dad used
to yell at me like that.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.087
He was an army colonel.
He was trained to yell
so you could hear him

14:17.088 --> 14:19.289
From one end of the base
to the other.

14:19.290 --> 14:23.226
Randy, can you leave us
alone for a few minutes?

14:23.227 --> 14:26.296
But it's my room.

14:26.297 --> 14:29.900
I'm trying to tell
mark a story from when
I was a little girl.

14:29.901 --> 14:31.569
I'm outta here.

14:33.605 --> 14:37.040
Hey, hey. Not so fast.
Come on, talk to me.

14:37.041 --> 14:40.444
I don't want to talk.
Well, ok.

14:40.445 --> 14:43.447
Ok, then I'll just
sit here with you.

14:45.416 --> 14:49.753
I could tell you
about the time that
my father yelled at me

14:49.754 --> 14:52.122
'cause I was trying
to sneak out of the house

14:52.123 --> 14:54.291
In a skirt that he thought
was too short.

14:54.292 --> 14:57.628
It was way longer
than any of the skirts
my friends were wearing,

14:57.629 --> 14:59.463
Except of course,
for darlene mayberry,

14:59.464 --> 15:02.766
But she had really...
Chubby knees.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.905
<i>(chanting in japanese)</i>

15:09.741 --> 15:11.575
Wilson?

15:11.576 --> 15:15.980
<i>(continues chanting)</i>

15:15.981 --> 15:19.016
Wilson, could you
stop singing and talk
to me for a second?

15:19.017 --> 15:23.286
Well, hi-ho, neighbor.
Happy <i>tako age.</i>

15:23.287 --> 15:26.423
Happy yokohama to you.
What's with the kite?

15:26.424 --> 15:29.560
Well, today is the japanese
festival of tako age,

15:29.561 --> 15:31.428
Which means
"big kite-flying day."

15:31.429 --> 15:32.930
See, according to legend,

15:32.931 --> 15:36.934
A master of a 16th century
japanese castle flew a kite

15:36.935 --> 15:39.737
In order to celebrate
the birth of his son.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.840
Yeah? What did he do
when his son committed
his first crime?

15:42.841 --> 15:46.109
Pardon?

15:46.110 --> 15:49.112
I'm not gonna pardon him.

15:49.113 --> 15:51.314
What in the world
are you talking about?

15:51.315 --> 15:52.950
I'll tell you what
I'm talking about.

15:52.951 --> 15:56.219
Mark got caught stealing
a pocket knife from
harry's hardware store.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.789
I got really angry with him.
I really didn't like this.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.025
Jill got mad at me
because I was yelling at him.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.660
I told him he was grounded
for the rest of his life.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.495
Well, tim, that seems like
pretty harsh punishment.

16:05.496 --> 16:06.997
You know how I look at it?

16:06.998 --> 16:08.899
The stronger the punishment,
the less the likelihood is

16:08.900 --> 16:10.367
The kid will ever
do it again.

16:10.368 --> 16:12.570
Tim, many people
subscribe to that theory,

16:12.571 --> 16:15.405
But I'm reminded
of the great nietzsche.

16:15.406 --> 16:19.509
Wow. What a linebacker.
Green bay packers.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.579
No. No, no, no, no.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.413
Not ray nitschke.

16:23.414 --> 16:26.116
I'm talking about
friedrich nietzsche,
the german philosopher.

16:26.117 --> 16:29.086
Sure. Freddy. Yeah.
Yes.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.421
Nietzsche said that
punishment often increases

16:31.422 --> 16:33.090
The feelings
of estrangement

16:33.091 --> 16:36.961
And strengthens
the power of resistance.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.429
I think what influenced
me more was fisk.

16:39.430 --> 16:42.733
I didn't know you were
a fan of john fiske,
the english historian.

16:42.734 --> 16:47.404
I'm not. I'm talking
about carlton fisk,
the white sox catcher.

16:47.405 --> 16:50.173
He said if you get caught
stealing, throw him out.

16:53.945 --> 16:56.480
Hey, dad.
Hey, guys.

16:56.481 --> 16:58.582
Where's mark?
I don't know.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.918
He was supposed to
meet us at the bus stop,
but he never showed up.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.220
I told him to come
straight home after school.

17:03.221 --> 17:06.890
Dad, the kid's a convicted
hardware criminal.

17:06.891 --> 17:08.358
They're unpredictable.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.060
Come on, guys.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.395
Let's make some calls
and find your brother.
Come on, come on.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.732
<i>(both)</i> all right.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.935
Yeah. Pete's pets?
Hi, this is tim taylor.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.369
I was won... Thank you.

17:20.371 --> 17:23.040
Hearing's fine now. Ok.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.242
Yeah, we all love al.
That's great.

17:26.243 --> 17:30.080
I've got kind of
a serious issue here.
I'm looking for my son.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.582
Yeah, we bought a hamster
in there a little while ago.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.752
I'm looking...
How big is he?

17:34.753 --> 17:37.087
About the size of my hand
with a little tail on there.

17:37.088 --> 17:39.890
Oh, mark? Yeah.

17:39.891 --> 17:44.227
About 4'10",
shaggy blond hair, no tail.

17:44.228 --> 17:46.263
He hasn't been by there
at all, huh?

17:46.264 --> 17:48.766
Ok, but if he stops by,
you'll have him
call me, please?

17:48.767 --> 17:51.101
Thank you. Goodbye.
Where's mark?

17:51.102 --> 17:52.736
He didn't come home
from school,

17:52.737 --> 17:55.372
But there's no reason
to be concerned.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.975
Oh, my god.
Are you saying he ran away?

17:57.976 --> 18:00.744
We don't know that.
We know he's not at school
or any of his friends',

18:00.745 --> 18:03.113
Or the police, the hospital
or the pet store.

18:03.114 --> 18:05.382
Well, then where is he?
<i>(phone rings)</i>

18:05.383 --> 18:07.584
Hello.

18:07.585 --> 18:11.521
Yes. Oh, thank god.
He's ok.

18:11.522 --> 18:13.791
Really?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.060
Ok. We'll be there
as soon as we can.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.394
Bye-bye.
Well?

18:17.395 --> 18:18.896
He went
to the hardware store

18:18.897 --> 18:20.363
To apologize
for taking the knife.

18:20.364 --> 18:22.700
Well, that's great.
That's my boy there.

18:22.701 --> 18:26.336
Your boy doesn't wanna
leave the hardware store.

18:26.337 --> 18:27.705
All right.

18:31.576 --> 18:33.577
He doesn't wanna leave
the hardware store

18:33.578 --> 18:35.245
Because he's
afraid of you.

18:38.183 --> 18:44.354
So even though it was
only one cookie
that I stole,

18:44.355 --> 18:49.059
The point is I, too,
succumbed to temptation.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.195
You understand, mark?

18:51.196 --> 18:56.100
I think so, but what's
an appetite suppressant?

18:56.101 --> 18:59.369
Something his mother
obviously never found.

19:03.307 --> 19:05.342
Hi, honey.
Hey, mark.

19:05.343 --> 19:06.910
Hi, mom.

19:06.911 --> 19:08.478
Listen...

19:08.479 --> 19:10.114
We'll just be
in the back.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.149
If a customer comes in,
give us a call.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.417
Come on.
Thanks, guys.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.720
Hey, mark, let me
talk to you for a minute.

19:16.721 --> 19:18.388
I'm not gonna yell at you.

19:18.389 --> 19:20.224
I'm really sorry
I went nuts today.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.726
But what you did
really upset me.

19:22.727 --> 19:24.561
So you must
really hate me.

19:24.562 --> 19:27.497
Come on, mark.
No, I really, really
love you, all right?

19:27.498 --> 19:29.266
It's just...

19:29.267 --> 19:32.102
It's just certain things
really, really set me off.

19:32.103 --> 19:34.437
Excuse me,
do you have any mops?

19:34.438 --> 19:36.539
Can't you see I'm talking
to my kid here?

19:36.540 --> 19:38.208
Could you give us
a few minutes?

19:38.209 --> 19:39.877
Go get some coffee
or something?

19:39.878 --> 19:41.912
Is there a coffee place
in the area?

19:41.913 --> 19:43.747
What - do I look like
juan valdez here?

19:43.748 --> 19:45.749
Is she colombian?
Do you see beans?

19:45.750 --> 19:48.986
Here. Just take this.

19:51.422 --> 19:53.257
When you or your brothers

19:53.258 --> 19:55.292
Lie or cheat or steal
like this,

19:55.293 --> 19:57.928
It makes your mom and I
feel like we're not
doing our jobs right,

19:57.929 --> 20:00.330
And part of our job
is to make you see

20:00.331 --> 20:02.266
The difference
between right and wrong.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.067
I know it's wrong
to steal.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.670
Then why did you
take the knife?

20:06.671 --> 20:08.305
I don't know.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.740
I thought...

20:10.741 --> 20:13.643
If I had the knife,
brad and randy would
think I'm cool.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.014
I'm really sorry I did it.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.283
We know you're sorry.
Coming here showed that.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.951
It took a lot of guts.

20:20.952 --> 20:22.953
Which is why I spoke
to the governor,

20:22.954 --> 20:26.123
And we commuted
your sentence to two weeks.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.624
Thanks.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.626
Unfortunately, we found
that you haven't paid

20:29.627 --> 20:32.029
Your state income tax
for the last 11 years.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.630
Dad, I'm only ten.

20:33.631 --> 20:36.800
Hey, that's the government
for you.

20:36.801 --> 20:38.302
Bye, guys.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.403
Bye, guys. Thanks.
<i>(al)</i> oh, well, ok.

20:40.404 --> 20:42.539
<i>(jill)</i> you want to get
some ice cream?

20:42.540 --> 20:44.241
<i>(mark)</i> sure. Yes.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.645
What's the matter, al?

20:48.646 --> 20:51.081
Someone stole a mop.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.926
What are you doing?
Nothing.

21:02.927 --> 21:05.595
You were searching
their room.
No, I wasn't.

21:05.596 --> 21:09.599
I was looking for my issues
of my hot rod magazine.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.936
<i>Busty babes and buicks?</i>
Oh, yeah.

21:12.937 --> 21:16.874
Another fine volume
from your reference library.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.809
Something of yours
in here too.

21:19.810 --> 21:24.447
That's my recipe for tuna
and lima bean casserole.

21:24.448 --> 21:27.450
Why would they hide that?

21:27.451 --> 21:30.053
If it were me,
I would have burned it.

21:34.359 --> 21:37.427
What else of mine
have they got in here?

21:40.631 --> 21:41.932
Mom.

21:44.302 --> 21:47.637
What are you doing?

21:47.638 --> 21:49.606
Putting
your underwear away.

21:53.444 --> 21:56.013
In the desk drawer?

21:56.014 --> 21:58.181
Yes.

21:58.182 --> 22:02.152
It's something
my mother taught me.

22:02.153 --> 22:04.487
This way, if you're
doing your homework

22:04.488 --> 22:06.823
And you realize that...

22:06.824 --> 22:10.760
You're not wearing
any underwear,

22:10.761 --> 22:12.262
Then you don't have to walk

22:12.263 --> 22:14.064
All the way
to the dresser drawer.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.701
Come on.
I can't believe you...

22:18.702 --> 22:22.906
What? A little
blithering thief... What?

22:35.086 --> 22:36.954
I'm sorry. I really
just couldn't keep up

22:36.955 --> 22:38.788
The "little
blithering thief" thing.

22:38.789 --> 22:40.457
I... I didn't think that...

22:40.458 --> 22:42.259
<i>(tim)</i> what was
wrong with it?

22:42.260 --> 22:44.094
Blithering thief.
I just can't...

22:44.095 --> 22:46.930
Ok, let's get right back
into it.
