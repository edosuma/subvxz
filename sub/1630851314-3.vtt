00:01.392 --> 00:03.960
<i>Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:05.309
The Dictator, he had abilities
no one had ever seen.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.441
<i>The flames couldn't touch him.</i>

00:06.484 --> 00:08.051
I'm the Dictator's son.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.183
Every time I have a vision,

00:09.226 --> 00:10.706
<i>I see a little bit more.</i>

00:10.749 --> 00:13.056
Your brain is calling.
It says, "Stop hurting me."

00:13.100 --> 00:14.710
Someone could die, Kyle.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.885
Yeah. You.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.756
I know so little
about my own story.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.108
<i>The parts that I thought
I understood are unraveling.</i>

00:21.151 --> 00:23.458
<i>I'm a clone. I need answers.</i>

00:23.501 --> 00:25.373
-What are you keeping from us?
-I'm dying.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.331
I thought if I could
just cowboy my way

00:27.375 --> 00:29.029
into my final sunset

00:29.072 --> 00:31.509
that I wouldn't have
to face the hard part.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.163
All my samples were destroyed
in a lab fire,

00:33.207 --> 00:35.078
<i>so there's nothing left
back there for me.</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:36.253
Nothing is lost forever.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.777
They made booze from
extinct bacteria.

00:38.821 --> 00:39.865
You're a genius.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
Liz?

00:45.915 --> 00:47.221
Max.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.148
Uh, you're back in Roswell.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.150
Uh, couldn't find a...

01:03.193 --> 01:05.543
decent milkshake in L.A.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.896
Uh, I'm-I'm just here

01:21.472 --> 01:24.519

H-How's the novel?

I haven't been able to find
the inspiration to finish it.

when your annoying
little sister

02:54.130 --> 02:56.219
calls in the middle
of the night?

02:56.263 --> 02:59.309
Mm, it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.006
I had this idea
that might help

03:01.050 --> 03:02.573
stop Maria's mind
from degrading.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.358
Did you know that bacteria...

03:04.401 --> 03:06.795
Uh-uh. I'm not done
with the talking stick.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.972
Is this really about Maria,
or are you here because, uh...?

03:10.015 --> 03:11.365
Max and I are done.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.236
You know that.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.065
I actually saw him
outside the diner last night.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.849
-And?
-And...

03:17.893 --> 03:20.156
I remembered
how he shattered my heart

03:20.200 --> 03:22.289
when he burned down my lab.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.638
Hmm.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.597
Okay, let's talk about you.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.818
Have you met
any new friends lately?

03:29.861 --> 03:31.341
Come on.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.430
You have spent
so much time with Papi,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.606
you just made his pancake recipe
while barely awake.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.478
You don't get to eat my pancakes

03:37.521 --> 03:40.916
<i>and</i> give me a "you need to be
more outgoing" lecture. Mm-mm.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.745
You've just worked so hard
to rebuild your life.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.486
I want you
to actually get to live it.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.315
Yeah, and you don't want to talk
about Deputy Vanilla.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.578
Come on.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.319
Is that door really closed?

03:52.362 --> 03:55.235
If my crazy science works, then
I am never gonna have to worry

03:55.278 --> 03:58.803
about Max or his stupid
miracle DNA ever again.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.203
Okay.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.409
Firefighters are
still struggling

04:39.453 --> 04:42.107
to contain the wildfires
in Lincoln National Forest.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.935
Dozens of fires
are currently devastating

04:43.979 --> 04:45.372
hundreds of acres
of New Mexico forestland...

04:46.938 --> 04:48.853
...despite firefighters working

04:48.897 --> 04:50.551
throughout the night
to combat the flames.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.293
While some fires are close
to complete containment,

04:53.336 --> 04:55.947
other fires are still
largely uncontrolled.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.216
How else am I like him?

05:04.260 --> 05:06.393
Well, abilities are
passed down genetically,

05:06.436 --> 05:08.264
but they aren't predictable.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.922
You should be careful, son.
You might break your cage.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.490
I could kill you right now.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.666
Take your heart
and save Max.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.277
Well, then you'd be
just like your dad.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.246
Those little stones
are very precious.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.423
-Your mother was mining them.
-Don't...

05:37.424 --> 05:39.164
...talk about my mother.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.280
You're still here?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.978
Yeah.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.632
I, uh, seem to have
lost track of time

06:11.675 --> 06:14.243
going through
the old files.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.463
You should take
a break.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.465
Get some fresh air.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.075
-Look at the sky.
-I'm sorry,

06:20.118 --> 06:22.338
I was under the impression
you wanted me to do my job.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.861
Did you look at how
your predecessor did her job?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.472
Yeah. And all she did was leave

06:25.515 --> 06:27.517
a 500-page report
on weather patterns.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.736
She studied them
for a decade.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.651
You really think
12 hours is enough time

06:30.694 --> 06:32.653
to find something
in there?

06:32.696 --> 06:34.742
But if you're lucky,
you might find

06:34.785 --> 06:37.353
something in here.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.531
Okay, look, I, uh...

06:41.575 --> 06:44.273
I didn't sign up for <i>The Men
Who Stare at Goats,so...</i>

06:47.102 --> 06:50.932
Deep Sky was
established to explore

06:50.975 --> 06:54.675
the untapped potential
that lies within us all.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
And the universe itself.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.549
Our goal is to ask
the questions

06:59.593 --> 07:01.725
that no one else
has ever bothered to.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.553
Why'd you hire me, then?

07:03.597 --> 07:05.599
We think you have
the potential to do

07:05.642 --> 07:07.688
what your predecessors

07:07.731 --> 07:12.170
gaze into the abyss
until the abyss gazes back.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.389
And then what?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.130
Ask the abyss
what the machine does?

07:15.173 --> 07:16.653
Alex,

07:16.697 --> 07:20.178
your father only understood
the world in absolutes.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.354
You two

07:22.398 --> 07:24.705
were never headed
in the same direction.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.446
You knew him.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.926
I knew he wanted answers.

07:28.970 --> 07:32.234
And since the extent of
what we know about the machine

07:32.277 --> 07:34.715
is that it turns on
every 47 days,

07:36.891 --> 07:39.850
our approach is flawed.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.244
So if you want a chance
at solving this mystery,

07:42.287 --> 07:46.117
you need to start by
asking the right questions.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.250
-Which are what, exactly?
-If I asked them,

07:48.293 --> 07:52.384
they wouldn't be your questions,
now, would they?

08:01.872 --> 08:03.918
God, ever since
those fires started

08:03.961 --> 08:06.660
in Lincoln National Forest,
I can barely breathe.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.444
Turns out
I'm allergic to smoke.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.272
So thanks, Apocalypse.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.317
Well, I would say
"bless you," but...

08:12.361 --> 08:14.668
I'm more worried
about the poor souls

08:14.711 --> 08:17.497
who got buried
at Forever Drab.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.283
Oh, I'm sorry my visions
aren't more Instagrammable.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.768
Hey, I, uh, I got your message.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.683
It said you had another vision.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.988
Yeah, I wanted us
all together.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.686
Alex and Michael
aren't responding,

08:32.729 --> 08:34.601
and Kyle is, um...

08:34.644 --> 08:36.951
with Liz.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.694
Yeah, I ran into her last night.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.260
What?

08:42.304 --> 08:44.132
Why wouldn't you
tell me that? That's...

08:44.175 --> 08:46.003
'Cause I am too busy
trying to solve this puzzle

08:46.047 --> 08:47.527
to save us all, so...

08:48.615 --> 08:50.486
Tell me there's something new.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.576
I wasn't sure until we got here,
but now that I've seen it,

08:53.620 --> 08:56.057
I'm... I'm certain.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.320
This is where the funeral
takes place.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.758
Okay.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.238
Well, in that case,
who do we know

09:03.281 --> 09:04.848
that would have
a funeral here?

09:04.892 --> 09:07.372
Someone who wouldn't be
caught dead in a church.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.726
Who died?

09:18.122 --> 09:19.733
I'm sorry,
can we just talk about this

09:19.776 --> 09:20.603
before we issue
a death sentence?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.692
No one is gonna die,
Isobel.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.781
We... are gonna stop it.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.609
Yeah.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.655
We know that Alex is
covering up the murder,

09:28.698 --> 09:31.266
which implies that it's
-alien-related, right?
-Which could mean

09:31.309 --> 09:32.833
that you tried
to heal the victim

09:32.876 --> 09:34.661
and left one of
your infamous handprints.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.532
Or the victim is an alien.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.187
Or an alien committed the crime.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.537
Let's just stick to
the evidence here.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.843
Mom and Dad would have

09:42.886 --> 09:44.671
their funerals at
a church, right?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.194
What about the Ortechos?

09:46.237 --> 09:48.196
Ortechos are <i>muy Católicos.</i>

09:48.239 --> 09:51.199
So that just... leaves Michael.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.375
Well...

09:53.418 --> 09:55.507
what do I win?

09:55.551 --> 09:56.639
Cash prize...

09:58.162 --> 09:59.773
...or is it just
an untimely death?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.383
Sit down, Guerin.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.777
All right? I lost a lot
of brain cells over this one.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.127
You're gonna let me
finish. Now, listen.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.694
-Mm-hmm.
-During the vision,

10:07.737 --> 10:09.478
I saw sunflowers,
and they were placed

10:09.521 --> 10:10.784
across a casket.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.264
That's because Sanders and I
are growing those

10:13.308 --> 10:15.919
for the Garden Festival
this year.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.399
Well, I also heard a song.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.879
It was like...

10:18.922 --> 10:20.097
♪ Do, do, do, do...

10:20.141 --> 10:22.056
It's called "Canción Mixteca."

10:23.013 --> 10:26.669
-How do you know that?
-Aside from it playing
at my funeral?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.671
Sanders hums it
all the time.

10:28.715 --> 10:32.457
He learned it when he was a kid,
helping out in the pecan fields.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.767
Is there anything else

10:37.811 --> 10:40.204
that can get us closer
to a suspect?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.685
There was a guy, and he said

10:42.729 --> 10:45.253
i-if the sheriff's department
had responded

10:45.296 --> 10:46.863
the day that he filed
the complaint,

10:46.907 --> 10:48.865
then none of this
would've happened.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.477
But, um, some

10:52.521 --> 10:54.697
think I saw snow
on someone's shoulder,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.047
so maybe we have some time.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.180
Okay. That is good.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.486
So, that's a couple months.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.098
You know what?
Don't worry about it, DeLuca.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.015
Lightning has set most of
New Mexico on fire anyways.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.627
At least your boy's
gonna go out in flames.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.242
All right. Well, I'm gonna
go to the station,

11:18.286 --> 11:19.983
pull some files,
see if I can find a complaint

11:20.027 --> 11:21.898
that matches
that description.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.734
You know, most people visit
the rodeo when they're in town.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.083
Most people haven't
figured out how to recover

11:33.127 --> 11:35.042
an alien cerebral cortex.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.741
What do you mean,
"recover"?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.874
Noah's brain is toast.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.397
Burnt toast.

11:50.492 --> 11:54.452
You're hoping to extract
Noah's DNA from charcoal?

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
My coworker at Genoryx
reminded me

11:56.063 --> 11:57.673
that bacterial endospores
can withstand

11:57.717 --> 11:59.588
even the most extreme
environmental conditions.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.807
And he did it with rum.

12:00.850 --> 12:04.158
Hmm. Please tell me
you brought some.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.551
I just got to get this
underneath a microscope.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.336
If the spores are there,
then I can crack them open

12:08.379 --> 12:10.425
and create new brain tissue
from the core.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.775
I hope.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.952
If a fireballed lab can't stop
the great Liz Ortecho,

12:15.996 --> 12:17.824
what could you
possibly need me for?

12:17.867 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, we built
this place together,

12:20.043 --> 12:22.176
so, you know, you might see
something that I don't.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.048
Or you want to compare
the proteins in these spores

12:25.092 --> 12:26.354
to the unique
healing properties

12:26.397 --> 12:28.443
found in
a certain someone's DNA.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.925
I spent months
studying Max's cells.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.014
I just want my research back,
and all I would need

12:34.057 --> 12:35.450
is just a microgram
of his blood.

12:35.493 --> 12:38.801
If you need Max's blood,
you need to ask him yourself.

12:38.845 --> 12:39.976
You know that, right?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.804
Yes. I...

12:41.848 --> 12:43.893
Course I do.

13:01.389 --> 13:04.218
I don't know why
I'm so upset.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.844
You're afraid
that you're not doing enough.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.020
Excuse me?

13:26.370 --> 13:29.199
You really know how to hit
where it hurts, don't you?

13:29.243 --> 13:30.897
I-I don't know
where that came from,

13:30.940 --> 13:34.248
but I don't think that. I...

13:47.087 --> 13:49.959
Has everyone forgotten
I have a day job?

13:51.395 --> 13:52.614
Hey.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.355
Can you hang on to this?

13:54.398 --> 13:56.400
No. No.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.359
No, I can't be in the middle
of you two, and just...

13:58.402 --> 14:00.840
-No.
-Please. You said you wanted
to see this through.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.190
This isn't what I meant, okay?

14:03.233 --> 14:05.540
Liz is going to hate me, and
she's also gonna hate you,

14:05.583 --> 14:07.934
but you're gonna be dead,
so what do you care?

14:07.977 --> 14:09.152
Whoa. Whoa.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.547
Have you been
mainlining acetone?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.723
Just for a couple weeks.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.203
Look, but...

14:16.246 --> 14:18.074
A couple days ago,
it stopped working.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.902
My heart is racing.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.034
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.687
Can't think straight?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.952
Any vertigo?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.214
Yeah.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.694
All signs of late-stage
heart failure.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.480
Oh, great. Cool.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.966
-You have to talk to Liz.
-No.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.706
I can't.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.666
It is not safe
for her to be here.

14:47.016 --> 14:50.280
Is there something else
going on?

14:54.023 --> 14:57.070
What if, um...

14:57.113 --> 15:01.291
if I told you I had a clone?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.300
I'm in a nightmare.
There's another you? How?

15:10.344 --> 15:12.346
You know,
I don't even want to know.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.043
I can't explain it,
but the last few days,

15:14.087 --> 15:16.176
I felt this, um...

15:16.219 --> 15:18.047
like, this pull.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.617
But it just keeps getting worse.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.795
So, you're saying
the person

15:26.838 --> 15:29.058
you have locked up is
just trying to draw you to him

15:29.102 --> 15:30.712
like some alien pied piper?

15:30.755 --> 15:32.975
I don't know, man!
Okay? I can't explain it.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.759
I don't know
what is happening.

15:34.803 --> 15:37.066
But can you make it stop?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.981
I need to solve
this murder,

15:39.025 --> 15:40.330
but this is making me crazy.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.854
Yeah, and you're
making <i>me</i> crazy.

15:42.898 --> 15:45.118
Yeah, you kept
a healthy duplicate of you

15:45.161 --> 15:47.120
locked up for a year

15:47.163 --> 15:48.512
when I've been
exhausting myself

15:48.556 --> 15:49.992
spending every free
minute trying to search

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
for anything to fix your heart!

15:52.821 --> 15:54.214
Look, why would you
keep this a secret?

15:54.257 --> 15:55.998
Because it is not safe.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.739
Okay? He is a liability.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.394
I'm your doctor, Max.
I should've been the exception.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.961
You could've at least

16:02.004 --> 16:03.658
given me a fighting chance
at saving you.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.529
-I'm not asking you to save me!
-No.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.357
You're just asking me
to stand by and watch

16:07.401 --> 16:09.533
as you destroy yourself.
And Liz!

16:09.577 --> 16:11.666
I am trying <i>not</i> to destroy Liz.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.495
Do you have

16:14.538 --> 16:16.714
something stronger than acetone?

16:18.542 --> 16:20.805
I've done everything I could
for you.

16:24.722 --> 16:28.030
The only way to save you now
is if that clone

16:28.074 --> 16:30.032
is a healer, too.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.600
Or if he gives you the heart
right out of his chest.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.256
Okay.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.783
I'll give you the best
modern medicine has to offer.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.396
And I'll hold on
to your damn letter.

16:53.316 --> 16:57.059
What is this,
and why does it make me cry?

16:57.103 --> 17:00.062
I asked Michael, and he
said he got it from you.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.498
The turquoise.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.152
It was an amplifier.

17:03.196 --> 17:07.156
It vibrates at
the same frequency we do.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.550
And this, uh,
ET tuning fork

17:09.593 --> 17:11.943
ended up in the New Mexican
desert how, exactly?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.209
It was that night in '47.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.603
Our ship was breaking apart
before we even hit the ground.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.954
And the chemicals it spewed...

17:22.998 --> 17:24.260
it killed cattle.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.871
It made
the cactus flowers bloom,

17:26.915 --> 17:29.091
but then it turned
that little stone

17:29.135 --> 17:30.919
into something else entirely.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.052
What does it do?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.836
It boosts our abilities.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.447
So, what is my ability?
Depression?

17:37.491 --> 17:40.102
What, you really haven't
figured it out yet?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.322
I mean, can't you sense
when something is off?

17:42.365 --> 17:44.454
Emotional shifts
in other people?

17:44.498 --> 17:47.588
You're an empath, Isobel.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.904
♪ I got a heavy heart...

18:02.733 --> 18:04.648
♪ I know you hate the part...

18:04.692 --> 18:07.129
Gregory. Hi.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.219
Hi. I mean,
I considered not helping you

18:10.263 --> 18:11.481
because you are
a strong woman.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.918
No, you can lift my keg anytime.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.096
Then you can let me help you
pour beers from it, too.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.012
I cannot let you do that.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.364
It's either I can stay here
and help you

18:24.407 --> 18:28.150
or I can go home to...

18:28.194 --> 18:30.152
cold pizza.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.371
Have pity on me, DeLuca.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.982
-I'm a... I'm a sad, sad man.
-Aw.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.290
Well, sad, sad man,

18:37.333 --> 18:39.640
you can get boxes
out of my truck.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.426
Yes, ma'am.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.343
So, is this a
locals only bar?

18:49.215 --> 18:50.999
Yeah. Tourists usually party

18:51.042 --> 18:53.132
down at Saturn's Ring,
but, um...

18:53.175 --> 18:55.351
You're a local, girl.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.181
Okay, okay.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.009
What was that?

19:01.052 --> 19:02.228
-That is

19:02.271 --> 19:04.012
just a friend.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.449
I cannot wait to hear everything
you are not telling me

19:06.493 --> 19:08.103
about Gregory Manes,

19:08.147 --> 19:09.757
but I'm guessing

19:09.800 --> 19:12.629
he's not why you sent that "I
need to see you right now" text.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.329
It's Max, isn't it?

19:18.548 --> 19:22.073
Oh, it's a powerful ability.
Empathy.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.597
Probably could

19:23.640 --> 19:26.861
fix whatever's got you,
Max and Michael out of sync.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.214
What does this have to do
with Max and Michael?

19:34.390 --> 19:36.218
E-Everything.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.266
Those boys are pulling away.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.272
I know.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.100
It feels unnatural.

19:50.232 --> 19:53.104
It's painful, even.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.326
If you'd like,

19:57.370 --> 19:59.372
I can teach you
how to separate.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.548
No.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.291
Teach me how to fix it.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.901
You can't.

20:06.944 --> 20:10.296
They have to choose
to come back to you.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.820
Tell me more about my ability.

20:14.169 --> 20:18.086
Well... there was a time

20:18.129 --> 20:20.436
when the Dictator

20:20.480 --> 20:23.396
had your mother and I
as prisoners.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.833
As an empath,

20:25.876 --> 20:28.314
she could target
people's weaknesses,

20:28.357 --> 20:30.968
warn him
of their strengths.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.753
She told me

20:32.796 --> 20:35.799
empathy's about acknowledging
what's yours and what isn't.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.152
It's like a candle.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.067
What makes it burn?

20:43.111 --> 20:44.330
The wick.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114
Exactly.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.770
So, when you see the flame,
find the wick.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.382
Find the source.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.563
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.870
-Hey, big guy! Hey, come on.
-Excuse me.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.264
Hey, you want to tell me

21:05.307 --> 21:06.613
why I was just stung
by a bee?

21:07.875 --> 21:10.356
I don't bring my bees
to public events,

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
you probably
stepped on some nettle.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.924
He's right, Jordan. I mean,

21:13.968 --> 21:15.448
there's stinging nettle
all around here.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.538
Nah, I saw a bee. A mean one.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.409
You got a permit for this booth?

21:20.453 --> 21:22.629
They don't need one.
It's a city event.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.195
They were all asked
to be here.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.588
Gregory Manes, yeah.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.069
I remember you.
We went to school together.

21:28.112 --> 21:28.983
You were the kid

21:29.026 --> 21:30.463
who cried over that dead bird.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.248
And you were the kid
who smashed his head in.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.206
What do you want, Jordan?

21:35.250 --> 21:37.905
Oh. Well, we're just a...
a group of concerned citizens

21:37.948 --> 21:39.733
looking out for our
fellow townsfolk.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.343
Funny thing about
concerned citizens.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.997
They always seem to be
white men with guns.

21:44.172 --> 21:45.260
-Jordan.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.044
Seriously.

21:47.088 --> 21:48.481
Let's go.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.613
Whose side are you on, Long?

21:50.657 --> 21:53.703
The side of not
being an ass.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.234
Y'all enjoy your movie.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.239
Later, Wyatt.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.901
Sorry... about all that.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.644
Really.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.609
Yeah, I think it's time
someone go to the sheriff

22:29.652 --> 22:31.698
and complain about those idiots.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.005
<i>If the sheriff's department</i>

22:35.049 --> 22:37.573
had responded the day
that he filed the complaint,

22:37.617 --> 22:39.096
then none of this
would have happened.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.578
How long has this
been going on?

22:42.622 --> 22:45.494
Oh, in America?
I'd say about 250 years.

22:45.538 --> 22:46.974
He means with
the Roswell Regiment, Bert.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.019
But Sheriff Valenti
shut that down.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.674
Yeah, she tried.
They just hit pause.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.502
It's been pretty obvious
over the last few months

22:53.546 --> 22:55.591
that Valenti was gonna lose
the election.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.462
Now that she's gone,
those clowns are back

22:58.028 --> 23:00.291
harassing people
that don't look like them.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.293
And it wasn't Wyatt
leading the charge this time.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.599
It was Jordan Bernhardt.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.602
-The mayor's son?
The word is,

23:06.646 --> 23:10.301
the mayor and our new sheriff
are old golf buddies.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.781
Okay.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.436
Fill this out
and give it back to me,

23:14.480 --> 23:16.438
but me only, okay?

23:16.482 --> 23:18.005
We'll take
care of this.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.486
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Two beers.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.924
Seems your vision is pointing
more and more

23:23.967 --> 23:27.057
to a, uh, the long grudge
between Michael and Wyatt.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.886
Yeah. Add Jordan to the mix,
you got a recipe for disaster.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.932
-I should warn Michael.
-Good luck.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.325
Got a lot of hard conversations
ahead of you.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.415
I saw Liz.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.155
Couldn't lie to her.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.640
Why did you keep this from me?

23:44.684 --> 23:47.861
You just found out Max is dying,
and instead of asking him

23:47.904 --> 23:50.994
why he's been hiding it
from you, you came here,

23:51.038 --> 23:54.650
to yell at me, who's ethically
bound to keep it a secret?

23:55.825 --> 23:57.697
Why are you so afraid
to talk to him?

23:57.740 --> 24:01.657
I am not afraid.
I am furious at him.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.834
He made me believe
that I was capable of anything,

24:04.878 --> 24:07.010
of being anyone,
and then he took it away

24:07.054 --> 24:08.664
when he burned it all down.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.667
You used his DNA, Liz,
without telling him.

24:11.711 --> 24:12.886
Max didn't
put you here.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.844
You did, when you decided

24:14.888 --> 24:16.846
to put science above
everything else.

24:16.890 --> 24:20.589
Success at any cost has a cost,

24:20.633 --> 24:23.418
and you never stopped
to consider it.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.989
Look, you can run from
Max, forever if you want.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.034
But you can't run
from yourself.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.559
Eventually, you'll have
to take responsibility

24:33.602 --> 24:37.171
for the things that you've
done to the people you love.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.828
All I ever wanted
was to save lives.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.526
That doesn't make it right.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.050
Yeah.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.009
I can't keep
doing this.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.838
Letting you and Max and
everyone pull me into things

24:51.881 --> 24:53.622
that I didn't ask for.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.668
If you want
something from Max,

24:55.711 --> 24:58.105
ask Max, not me.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.979
And while you're at it,

25:03.023 --> 25:05.852
ask him about his <i>other</i> secret.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.158
The one out in the desert.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.390
Hey.
Hey.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.957
Oh, man, you feeling, uh,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.742
nostalgic about
the good old days?

25:26.786 --> 25:29.789
This was Dad's favorite
family activity.

25:29.832 --> 25:30.964
Little popcorn...

25:31.007 --> 25:32.705
Little xenophobia
about aliens.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.402
Yeah.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.969
If you miss him,

25:36.012 --> 25:37.971
we can go egg the statue
in the town square.

25:38.014 --> 25:42.018
Speaking of,
how are you holding up?

25:43.324 --> 25:46.457
Oh, you know, most days I can
rationalize that I killed a...

25:46.501 --> 25:47.763
a bad man.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.460
But, uh,

25:49.504 --> 25:53.377
some days, I remember
that man was my father.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.555
You seem to be doing better
than you were a few months ago.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.079
Yeah.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.516
Does it happen to have anything
to do with my dream girl?

26:01.560 --> 26:02.561
Maria DeLuca?

26:02.604 --> 26:04.040
Oh.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.694
Well, please say "yes."
I have been waiting

26:05.738 --> 26:07.740
for you two to fall in
love since high school.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.046
You know, I can
be myself around her,

26:10.090 --> 26:12.745
and that is rare
for a Manes man.

26:12.788 --> 26:15.051
Yeah.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.837
Ah, but somehow,
I don't think

26:17.880 --> 26:19.621
that's what you wanted
to talk about.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.930
Well, I, um...

26:23.973 --> 26:27.586
I left the Air Force,
full honors.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.154
I got an opportunity,
and I took it.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.767
But, uh, uh...

26:34.810 --> 26:37.987
it's been one day,
and I already just...

26:38.031 --> 26:40.599
You're scared
you made a mistake.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.645
My new boss suggested that
I solve a potential matter

26:43.689 --> 26:46.648
of national security
by looking up at the sky.

26:46.692 --> 26:47.867
And then he brought up Dad.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.738
What? They knew each other?

26:49.782 --> 26:51.392
Couldn't have
been well.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.917
My first assignment was to
stop thinking like my father.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.139
Well, he's kind of
right, though.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.923
I mean, think about it, Alex.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.622
I mean,
why'd you join the Air Force?

27:05.014 --> 27:06.450
To get away from him, to...

27:06.494 --> 27:08.365
to get control of my life... Well, then,

27:08.409 --> 27:10.803
you should've joined the Navy,
or the Marines or even the Army.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.718
When you joined
the Air Force,

27:12.761 --> 27:15.242
you were following
in his footsteps.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.679
My advice? You left the service,

27:17.723 --> 27:20.334
so you can take off the uniform.

27:20.377 --> 27:23.642
And do what? Look at the sky?

27:24.381 --> 27:26.209
Stop listening
to Dad's voice in your head

27:26.253 --> 27:28.690
and start listening
to your own.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.172
All right, look,
you're gonna figure it out.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.782
All right, just be patient.

27:33.826 --> 27:36.176
Thanks.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.709
<i>You're suspiciously quiet.</i>

27:47.753 --> 27:51.713
You said you wanted to listen
to Natalie Merchant and chill.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.938
Do you think what happened
with Max is my fault?

27:58.981 --> 28:00.896
I think it was
both of your faults.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.943
Yeah, but what he did, it...

28:05.422 --> 28:07.860
-...it was too much.
-Absolutely.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.470
I just think it's possible

28:09.513 --> 28:12.212
that he might think the
same thing about what you did.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.996
In NA,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.825
we talk a lot about
personal responsibility.

28:16.869 --> 28:17.826
Max is

28:17.870 --> 28:20.699
100% responsible
for what Max did.

28:21.961 --> 28:24.006
And so are you.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.930
We heard you snitched
to the cops about us.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.890
We ain't gonna stand by and let
you destroy our town anymore.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.762
Okay, look, I don't want to die
tonight, so let's talk.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.765
Let's talk.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.898
Why talk if you never listen?

28:47.987 --> 28:49.728
Damn it, Zeke!
-What the hell?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.773
Oh, maybe if you guys
stopped hitting each other,

28:51.817 --> 28:53.862
you wouldn't need four guys
to commit one hate crime.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.778
-Walk away.
-Oh, I wish I could.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.519
That's just not
really who I am.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.565
Hit me.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.438
'Cause I really want
to hit you back.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.961
Michael?

29:08.224 --> 29:10.531
Small town, Guerin.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.360
I'm sure we'll bump into
each other again real soon.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.930
So, I'm trying
to save your life,

29:17.973 --> 29:19.801
and you try
to get yourself killed?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.803
What-what is going on
with you, Michael?

29:21.847 --> 29:23.849
It does not matter.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.808
-I'm dying anyway.
-No, you're not,

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
because we can still find a way
to change this.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.899
-Oh, maybe I don't
want to change it.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.988
Maybe I deserve it.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.381
You ever think
of that, Max?

29:34.424 --> 29:36.470
Find the source.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.733
Get over yourself, Michael.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.083
You don't
deserve to die.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.914
He told you something.

29:46.872 --> 29:47.829
Who did?

29:47.873 --> 29:49.396
No, I know that self-loathing

29:49.439 --> 29:52.181
is kind of your thing,
but... this is different.

29:52.225 --> 29:55.619
You're ashamed.
You think that you're...

29:55.663 --> 29:57.099
a monster.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.800
Because I am.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.629
I am the heir
to an evil dictator.

30:05.673 --> 30:06.805
Okay?

30:06.848 --> 30:07.980
Monster's in my blood.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.155
You finished the cage?

30:09.198 --> 30:11.548
Two days ago, we pulled him out.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.420
This morning,
I nearly slit his throat.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.857
What are you talking
about, Michael?

30:15.901 --> 30:17.946
The Dictator--
I'm his son.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.862
Apparently,
I have a temper.

30:20.906 --> 30:21.994
What did he tell you?

30:24.039 --> 30:26.041
What we've always known.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.217
I'm the tyrant;
you're the savior.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.665
The two of you went down there
without me. Seriously?

30:41.709 --> 30:42.884
This isn't how
I wanted this to go.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.103
How did you think
it was gonna go?

30:44.146 --> 30:45.669
Okay, you're right.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.106
We've all been hiding things
from each other.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.282
And it has to stop.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.980
We're not strong
unless we're together.

30:52.024 --> 30:54.896
It's like you said; there has
to be three. We're a triad.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.072
Did Jones tell you that?

30:57.116 --> 30:58.944
What else did he tell you?

30:58.987 --> 31:00.989
About our planet and...

31:01.033 --> 31:02.338
and why we came here.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.949
And that I'm an empath.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.994
That's how I know
what's going on with Michael.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.822
We need to put him back.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.954
In the pod?

31:08.997 --> 31:11.217
No. You want to see him.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.741
Not anymore. What were you
thinking? Liz is in town.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.569
Liz? What does Liz
have to do with this?

31:15.612 --> 31:17.788
Have you met her?
If she finds out

31:17.832 --> 31:20.008
about this,
she's not going to leave.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.096
Okay?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.924
Jones is dangerous.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.013
How do you know that?

31:25.057 --> 31:26.058
I can't explain it.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.712
It's just a feeling
in my gut, okay?

31:28.756 --> 31:29.975
He is dangerous, Isobel.

31:30.018 --> 31:32.368
Just leave this be.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.330
I saw your car.

31:37.373 --> 31:39.114
Wanted to give you
this turquoise.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.030
It resonates
with our tech.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.075
I don't know why.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.380
But I do know

31:44.424 --> 31:46.643
that if any alien
mysteries come around,

31:46.687 --> 31:48.515
I won't be here
to play Hardy Boys.

31:48.558 --> 31:49.951
I'm getting
murdered.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.389
Michael Guerin going down
without a fight?

31:53.433 --> 31:55.174
I don't believe it.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.524
Well, you always did see
the violence in me, didn't you?

31:57.567 --> 31:59.134
What are you talking about?

31:59.178 --> 32:00.657
I could never do
the right thing.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.529
Turns out
neither could my father.

32:02.572 --> 32:05.053
-And how do you know that?
-It doesn't matter.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.099
He was a killer.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.884
Genocidal maniac, actually.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.061
Wow, you must've loved that.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.889
You've been looking for proof
that you were worthless

32:14.933 --> 32:16.108
your whole life.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.066
What can I say?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.112
I had a hunch.

32:20.155 --> 32:23.550
Look, if you're your father,
then I'm mine.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.987
Which means I have
a lot of torturing to do

32:26.031 --> 32:28.598
before the end of the night,
so excuse me.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.515
It's not, it's not the same.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.690
No, it is.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.170
I hate to break it to you,
Guerin,

32:35.214 --> 32:37.085
but there's not
some special set of rules

32:37.129 --> 32:39.000
that applies just to you.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.263
You decide
who you are.

32:41.307 --> 32:45.180
If you give up, it is on you.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.581
Hmm.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.061
Wait.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.935
In Maria's vision, I say that I
am covering up a murder, right?

33:00.979 --> 33:02.241
Yeah.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.372
It's not you.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.113
-You can't know that.
-Yes, I can.

33:05.157 --> 33:08.116
If it were you,
I would not cover it up.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.427
I would burn
the entire world down first.

33:15.210 --> 33:18.257
[engine starts]♪ I had it in my head
but not in my heart ♪

33:18.300 --> 33:21.042
♪ Every word that I said brought
you back to the start... ♪

33:23.001 --> 33:24.089
-Max!

33:24.132 --> 33:26.265
♪ But I'm not in charge

33:26.308 --> 33:27.222
♪ But it's beautiful...

33:27.266 --> 33:29.094
I-I've been
looking for you.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.399
I should've
found you earlier.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.184
I just had things
on my mind, so...

33:32.227 --> 33:34.012
Like...

33:34.055 --> 33:36.405
someone getting murdered
or your heart failing?

33:36.449 --> 33:38.233
I should've told you.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.495
I-I get why
you didn't.

33:39.539 --> 33:40.931
I mean, we've hardly
been in a place

33:40.975 --> 33:42.324
to share our deepest,
darkest secrets.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.587
And... you
told Kyle,

33:44.631 --> 33:46.241
so...

33:46.285 --> 33:48.417
that's good.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.159
Ever since last night,
I've wanted to talk...

33:51.203 --> 33:53.248
Can I go first? I...

33:54.467 --> 33:58.688
I never should've hidden
what I was doing in the lab.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.561
I-I was so afraid

34:01.604 --> 34:03.998
of who I'd be without my
groundbreaking discovery

34:04.042 --> 34:07.088
that I-I forgot about
the other part,

34:07.132 --> 34:09.482
the important part, and...

34:10.396 --> 34:12.006
...it's you.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.966
I was wrong, Max. I was wrong.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.403
I-I...

34:18.143 --> 34:19.840
I should've told you
what I was doing.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.321
And when you asked me
to stop, I should have.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.411
And I never should have
burned down the lab.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.110

to you, Kyle.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.252
No.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.384
I brought this
on myself.

36:09.428 --> 36:12.300
I think I'm...

36:13.301 --> 36:15.477
...lost.

36:15.521 --> 36:18.219
I thought when I became
a doctor, my life would...

36:18.263 --> 36:20.221
suddenly feel
complete.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.353
But...

36:21.396 --> 36:24.312
still feel empty inside.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.275
Have you heard of, um...

36:30.318 --> 36:31.406
sleeping?

36:31.450 --> 36:33.408
It's phenomenal.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.409
You should try it.

36:34.453 --> 36:35.845
Seriously though,

36:35.889 --> 36:38.674
you should take care of yourself
for once.

36:38.718 --> 36:43.157
I mean, you, of all people,
deserve to be happy.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.771
My dad was wrong
about most things,

36:48.815 --> 36:51.252
but he was right
about one.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.689
Ever since '47, this town has
been at the center of a story

36:53.733 --> 36:55.256
that's bigger
than any one of us.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.693
My dad thought
that if he could just

36:57.737 --> 36:59.478
find out what the story
was really about...

36:59.521 --> 37:01.044
He could control it.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.263
Yeah,
but he couldn't.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.439
So he made it an enemy to fight.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.267
He made his whole life
a fight.

37:06.311 --> 37:10.576
Everything, everyone was just
something to charge through.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.404
But this machine,

37:12.447 --> 37:15.363
we cannot charge through it
to get the answer.

37:15.407 --> 37:18.627
So how do you propose
we get one?

37:18.671 --> 37:21.456
Well, we start with the basics.

37:22.675 --> 37:26.113
Is it built for good
or for evil?

37:26.156 --> 37:27.462
You've finally come.

37:27.506 --> 37:28.376
I didn't have
a choice.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.466
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.468
Only thing I can do is
think about coming here

37:33.512 --> 37:35.035
and talking to you. Why?

37:35.078 --> 37:37.167
Because we're connected,
you and I.

37:37.211 --> 37:38.430
But you already know that.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.301
When your siblings
pulled me out of the pod,

37:40.345 --> 37:44.392
it solidified
the invisible tether between us.

37:44.436 --> 37:46.046
But it didn't start with them.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.136
Started with the console
at the fair.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.269
When I awoke, so did you.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.574
I want it to stop.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.359
Because you want to be
with them?

37:54.402 --> 37:56.099
You have
to ask yourself,

37:56.143 --> 37:59.755
have you ever
truly felt connected to them?

38:00.626 --> 38:02.584
You have a decision to make.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.413
I choose them.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.460
I choose her.

38:08.503 --> 38:11.985
The woman who built
your failing heart?

38:12.812 --> 38:15.031
You love her, don't you?

38:15.075 --> 38:17.338
Hey, I pushed her away
because of you.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.775
Because of whatever this is!

38:19.819 --> 38:22.343
Make it stop. Set me free.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.649
I can't.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.346
It's not some power.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.566
It can't be quelled

38:27.609 --> 38:30.525
by my luxurious accommodations.

38:30.569 --> 38:34.268
When Nora and Louise stole
a piece of me to build you,

38:34.312 --> 38:36.357
they created
a wound so deep,

38:36.401 --> 38:40.143
it can only be healed
when we are together.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.581
Apart,
we are weak.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.844
Alone,
we are dead.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.585
But together... No!

38:46.628 --> 38:48.413
I don't need you.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.110
For years, I've-I've
been, I've been fine.

38:50.153 --> 38:51.503
I-I can choose.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.460
You can't!

38:52.504 --> 38:53.940
Unless you accept

38:53.983 --> 38:55.898
who you really are,
you will always suffer!

38:55.942 --> 38:57.596
You know that!
You are broken!

38:58.640 --> 39:00.729
Stop!

39:12.611 --> 39:14.047

getting closer.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.672
Oh, thank you.

39:30.716 --> 39:34.023
Ash is thicker than
usual.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.288
I thought it was snow
in my vision.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.029
It's ash.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.510
Maria!
We're out of time.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.512
The church is on fire.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.209
We can't use
the funeral home

39:46.253 --> 39:47.907
to narrow down the victim
in your vision.
