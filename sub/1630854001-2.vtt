WEBVTT

00:49.165 --> 00:52.873
Good luck not eating this.

00:52.939 --> 00:54.743
Pork buns

00:54.810 --> 00:57.314
from Qian's.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.405
What, are you giving me
the silent treatment?

01:12.478 --> 01:15.918
Doesn't seem very sophisticated
for a therapist.

01:15.985 --> 01:19.191
I'm not your therapist anymore.
I'm your prisoner.

01:19.258 --> 01:22.699
I understand why
you would think that, but...

01:24.268 --> 01:26.840
...you have to...

01:42.438 --> 01:44.809
Don't worry.
It's not a head or anything.

01:44.876 --> 01:47.381
Oh, that's a relief.

01:49.887 --> 01:52.158
You ever heard
of the John Doe Killer?

01:52.225 --> 01:53.761
I think so.

01:53.828 --> 01:55.865
The whole idea was
to make it look like robberies.

01:55.932 --> 01:58.771
So the police didn't get one
of those task forces going.

01:58.838 --> 02:01.944
So, you know, I took...
I took all this.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.415
And...

02:04.482 --> 02:07.287
next think I know, they're
calling me the John Doe Killer

02:07.354 --> 02:08.625
'cause sometimes
it took 'em a few days

02:08.691 --> 02:10.327
to figure out
who these people were

02:10.393 --> 02:11.797
without their IDs and stuff.

02:11.863 --> 02:15.136
And... now I'm kind of stuck
with it.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.439
You believe me now?

02:16.507 --> 02:18.511
You don't think I believed you?

02:18.578 --> 02:20.715
I get why it's easier
for you to think

02:20.781 --> 02:23.187
that maybe
I'm not telling the truth.

02:23.253 --> 02:26.492
I believed you.

02:35.912 --> 02:36.947
Would you like a watch?

02:37.014 --> 02:38.283
No, thanks.

02:38.349 --> 02:40.287
Keep track of time for yourself.

02:40.354 --> 02:42.024
I mean, they still work.

02:42.091 --> 02:44.361
Most of 'em.

03:18.864 --> 03:21.971
<i>
It's hard at first for everyone,</i>

03:22.037 --> 03:24.208
but especially someone like you.

03:24.977 --> 03:26.246
Someone like me?

03:26.313 --> 03:27.916
So in your head.

03:27.982 --> 03:32.391
That's where everything takes
place, including meditation.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.263
Like I said,
it's hard for someone like you.

04:00.915 --> 04:03.286
I'll be home by 5:00.

04:56.492 --> 04:58.664
:
Oh, come on.

05:08.316 --> 05:10.921
Shit.

05:17.702 --> 05:19.304
Oh, fuck.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.888
Ah.

05:43.954 --> 05:45.892
Okay.

06:32.752 --> 06:34.589
Thai food tonight.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.697
I got us Kaeng tai pla.

06:38.764 --> 06:42.672
This place makes their own sauce
using fermented fish entrails,

06:42.739 --> 06:45.778
which I know sounds gross,
but it gives it a lot of flavor.

06:45.845 --> 06:48.951
And then, Khanom moa gang.
They use

06:49.017 --> 06:51.388
taro and duck eggs.
That's dessert.

06:51.455 --> 06:53.827
You usually can't find it
this way.

07:20.013 --> 07:23.452
I don't think you can open that
with a plastic fork.

07:35.545 --> 07:38.382
After I do it,

07:38.449 --> 07:41.756
I'm... just...

07:42.525 --> 07:44.596
I bet most people couldn't...

07:44.662 --> 07:47.233
feel like that.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.539
It's not a normal feeling.

07:50.340 --> 07:54.181
It's more like... dead.

07:54.247 --> 07:56.686
I need to get better.

07:56.753 --> 07:59.325
Isn't that what you...
enjoy doing?

07:59.391 --> 08:04.034
Isn't healing people?

08:05.938 --> 08:09.044
I brought you here
so we could work together.

08:10.815 --> 08:14.321
I know you hate it, but...

08:14.388 --> 08:18.262
if you're not going
to be a part of the process,

08:18.329 --> 08:20.768
where is that gonna leave us?

09:11.102 --> 09:15.309
Successful therapy requires
a safe environment.

09:15.376 --> 09:19.451
The patient and the therapist
have to be able

09:19.519 --> 09:23.760
to dig into...
complicated emotional territory

09:23.827 --> 09:28.604
without anything like fear

09:28.670 --> 09:31.743
hanging over every session.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.287
I don't know
what to do about that.

09:41.696 --> 09:43.534
At least I want you...

09:43.601 --> 09:48.309
to make me a promise that while
we are in therapy together,

09:48.376 --> 09:53.353
that you will not commit
any acts of physical violence

09:53.419 --> 09:56.793
against me or anyone else

09:56.859 --> 09:59.198
unless you talk to me first.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.605
You mean you want me
to talk to you before I...?

10:02.672 --> 10:04.207
Yes.

10:04.274 --> 10:06.680
- So you can talk me out of it?
- So I can

10:06.747 --> 10:09.686
try to help you...

10:09.753 --> 10:11.690
get out of it.

10:11.757 --> 10:15.497
So together,
we can try to understand

10:15.565 --> 10:19.839
where this terrible need is
coming from, and to address it.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.647
You have no idea what it's like.

10:23.713 --> 10:26.318
- I understand.
- These fucking people...

10:26.385 --> 10:30.226
I work with a lot of people
with very serious,

10:30.293 --> 10:33.366
almost impossible-to-resist
compulsions.

10:33.432 --> 10:38.075
Making this kind of commitment
is key to the process.

10:40.447 --> 10:44.054
- I don't think it's the same.
- I'm not saying it's the same.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.437
I'll do my best.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.573
And actually,
it was my wife's idea.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.412
Uh, she's known
Chava's mother her whole life.

11:46.478 --> 11:51.088
So, if we have anyone to thank,
it's the rebbetzin.

11:51.155 --> 11:53.025
Chava can keep up with your son

11:53.092 --> 11:56.298
in-in both the intellectual area
and with humor.

11:56.365 --> 11:58.469
Oh.

11:59.471 --> 12:00.775
I'm so sorry.

12:00.841 --> 12:02.545
I should have brought
a real knife.

12:02.612 --> 12:03.546
- Oh, no, no.
- No.

12:03.613 --> 12:04.949
It's fine.

12:20.012 --> 12:22.183
- I was going to eat that.
- This isn't funny.

12:22.250 --> 12:25.925
<i>I'm upset, too,
but we need to let him be.</i>

12:25.991 --> 12:27.461
Oh, please don't tell me
you don't hate this

12:27.528 --> 12:28.797
just as much as I do.

12:28.863 --> 12:30.400
He's rebelling, Beth.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.170
Everyone does it.

12:50.339 --> 12:53.313
So, should I tell you more
about my life?

12:53.379 --> 12:55.182
Sure.

13:00.928 --> 13:02.296
There's this guy,

13:02.363 --> 13:05.571
uh, and I can't stop
thinking about him.

13:05.638 --> 13:08.643
I wish you knew
what this feels like. Uh...

13:08.710 --> 13:10.915
I did an inspection a while ago

13:10.981 --> 13:14.656
at a... a Greek restaurant
in Garten.

13:14.722 --> 13:17.427
Greek, but a-a modern take.

13:17.493 --> 13:21.035
They do
these moussaka-filled gyozas

13:21.101 --> 13:24.374
that just...
dissolve in your mouth.

13:24.441 --> 13:26.245
I actually used
to go there with my wife,

13:26.311 --> 13:27.949
even before I inspected it.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.120
You're married?

13:30.186 --> 13:32.224
I was.

13:33.326 --> 13:36.065
That was one of those things
I didn't, uh, tell you

13:36.131 --> 13:37.601
'cause I couldn't be
fully truthful.

13:37.668 --> 13:41.709
Anyway, uh, there were items
in the prep cooler

13:41.776 --> 13:43.279
that weren't dated,

13:43.345 --> 13:46.118
and the refrigerator door seal
needed to be replaced.

13:46.185 --> 13:48.557
And these aren't
uncommon things,

13:48.624 --> 13:50.059
but they need to be addressed,

13:50.126 --> 13:52.798
and they affect
a restaurant's rating.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.671
I explained it all to the guy
who runs the place,

13:55.738 --> 13:58.342
the owners' son, and...

13:58.409 --> 14:01.716
he didn't think
it was a big deal.

14:01.783 --> 14:03.921
I told him it was.

14:03.987 --> 14:06.793
He said I should come back
in a week,

14:06.860 --> 14:08.530
and everything would be fixed.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.734
I said the current wait time
for reinspection

14:10.801 --> 14:13.138
in Lincoln County
is seven months.

14:14.943 --> 14:17.380
He thought
I was trying to get a bribe.

14:18.182 --> 14:20.954
And he starts talking to me

14:21.021 --> 14:23.292
in this funny way, like...

14:25.029 --> 14:27.602
...he knows
how things really work,

14:27.669 --> 14:29.873
and I don't,

14:29.939 --> 14:32.444
and I'm just some piece of shit.

14:33.346 --> 14:35.984
And when people talk
to me like that...

14:43.032 --> 14:45.103
Anyway, I just left,

14:45.170 --> 14:48.175
which is what I do
in those situations.

14:50.413 --> 14:52.552
Then a couple weeks later,
my supervisor,

14:52.618 --> 14:56.526
Kyle, tells me
to go back right away

14:56.593 --> 14:59.464
and redo the inspection,
no reason given.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.903
And when I went there,
everything is fixed,

15:01.970 --> 15:04.207
and the guy barely looks at me.

15:05.342 --> 15:07.113
Smug.

15:11.957 --> 15:13.292
When was this?

15:13.359 --> 15:15.765
I don't know.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.469
About four months ago.

15:18.537 --> 15:20.941
And I haven't stopped...

15:21.008 --> 15:23.445
thinking about him.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.556
Every single day.

15:31.128 --> 15:33.398
I'm trying not to...

15:36.005 --> 15:39.177
I-I usually can't stop, but...

15:44.589 --> 15:46.692
I don't know
if other people have this.

15:46.759 --> 15:48.295
Do other people have this?

15:48.362 --> 15:52.003
People get obsessed with
interactions they've had, yes.

15:54.709 --> 15:57.180
I-I went back
to the restaurant...

15:58.950 --> 16:01.822
...the same night,
and I parked across the street,

16:01.889 --> 16:04.260
and I waited until they closed.

16:11.943 --> 16:15.584
I've never done anything that
they could trace back to me,

16:15.651 --> 16:18.155
but that night, I...
I was like...

16:26.739 --> 16:29.010
I didn't do it.

16:33.152 --> 16:35.422
How do you think
you managed that?

16:37.293 --> 16:38.864
I don't know.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.435
I didn't want to get caught.
I guess that helped.

16:42.170 --> 16:45.343
And you said
this was about four months ago?

16:45.409 --> 16:47.314
Yeah.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.618
Just before
you came to talk to me.

16:49.685 --> 16:53.560
And you thought
I could help you not hurt him.

16:57.969 --> 16:59.572
Mm-hmm.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.584
I need a pen and paper
for notes.

17:09.491 --> 17:11.061
I really thought through
all the things

17:11.128 --> 17:12.397
that you were going
to need here.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.902
I'm going
to need a pen and paper.

17:14.969 --> 17:19.511
I'm not going to attack you
with a piece of paper.

17:19.578 --> 17:23.620
And you can find a pen
that doesn't worry you.

17:26.124 --> 17:28.395
The restaurant guy.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.571
The more time that passes,

17:32.638 --> 17:36.780
the less anyone would connect me
with that place.

17:37.548 --> 17:40.921
I think it's important to note
that you did not hurt him.

17:40.988 --> 17:43.258
But I want to.

17:44.027 --> 17:46.431
I want to right now.

17:47.835 --> 17:50.206
You asked me
to talk to you first.

17:50.273 --> 17:53.111
I am talking to you.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.790
It's not really helping.

18:03.533 --> 18:07.306
You've been holding this in
for four months, Sam.

18:07.373 --> 18:09.645
I get why it's hard.

18:51.395 --> 18:53.700
:
Jesus.

19:07.895 --> 19:09.732
I'm late for work.

19:09.799 --> 19:12.336
Let's have a session
after dinner.

19:49.845 --> 19:51.816
:

19:55.723 --> 19:57.794
Hello?

20:10.754 --> 20:13.526
:
Can you hear me up there?

20:14.294 --> 20:16.397
I can hear you!

20:20.406 --> 20:22.544
Are you okay?

20:26.018 --> 20:27.721
Can you talk?

20:52.336 --> 20:54.675
Hello.

22:36.979 --> 22:39.417
