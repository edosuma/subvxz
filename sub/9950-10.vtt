WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:03.713
Look at me, right?
And look at the Queen.

00:04.307 --> 00:07.227
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:07.277 --> 00:08.897
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.973 --> 00:11.493
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.493 --> 00:13.493
I know she's not a single parent

00:13.493 --> 00:15.453
but she might as well be. Plus,

00:15.453 --> 00:19.453
the pair of us, we've stuck to our
guns, her literally, sometimes,

00:20.013 --> 00:21.653
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.653 --> 00:24.053
Admired and despised equally,

00:24.053 --> 00:26.493
not for never lifting a finger. No!

00:26.493 --> 00:29.493
For setting examples through
extremity.

00:29.493 --> 00:32.173
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:32.173 --> 00:33.293
you've still got all your

00:33.293 --> 00:35.093
dickheads in the middle to
deal with, snip

00:35.093 --> 00:36.493
snip snipping at your benefits.

00:36.493 --> 00:39.013
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:39.013 --> 00:42.293
"What's your secret,
Frank?" I got shot

00:42.293 --> 00:44.013
of my kids yonks back,

00:44.013 --> 00:46.533
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.533 --> 00:48.813
Fine! I've had to get out of bed on
occasion to

00:48.813 --> 00:50.573
make ends meet, whereas she...

00:50.573 --> 00:54.533
she's
done the whole thing from a chair!

00:54.533 --> 00:56.373
Oh, a drink for the lady.

00:56.373 --> 00:57.853
Oh sure, there's perks.

00:57.853 --> 00:58.893
But look at her lot.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.613
Brian May prancing
about on her roof!

01:01.613 --> 01:03.973
Now, look at my lot.

01:03.973 --> 01:07.816
We know how to
throw a proper fucking paaaarty!

'If you knew what other people
thought of you,

01:20.403 --> 01:23.443
'would you behave the same?

01:23.443 --> 01:25.203
'The way I see it,

'Then there's that you that you

01:39.683 --> 01:42.563
'see, what you really
think about yourself.'

01:42.563 --> 01:44.403
It's all about the rights of people,

01:44.403 --> 01:46.083
the rights of men,
the rights of women,

01:46.083 --> 01:50.083
not just about tarts under
horses at the derby.

01:50.683 --> 01:51.843
'And sometimes,

01:51.843 --> 01:55.843
'those two versions, they're
really different.'

Twat!

02:22.243 --> 02:23.683
D'you really think I can do it?

02:23.683 --> 02:24.763
No!

02:24.763 --> 02:27.003
Fix it or I'll have your balls.

02:27.003 --> 02:29.043
Right. Go on, then. Ask me one of
them questions.

02:29.043 --> 02:30.403
What's going on?

02:30.403 --> 02:32.803
William here's
sick of being bone idle.

02:32.803 --> 02:35.523
Since when?

02:35.523 --> 02:39.523
So William, what are your strengths
and weaknesses?

02:40.403 --> 02:43.403
I've been knocked unconscious
maybe seven or eight times,

02:43.403 --> 02:46.483
and I've got no permanent brain
injury.

02:46.483 --> 02:47.523
My weaknesses?

02:47.523 --> 02:50.443
Err... OK.

02:50.443 --> 02:51.803
I'm not a very quick learner,

02:51.803 --> 02:54.723
but when I get it, I've got it.

02:54.723 --> 02:58.723
And not even a crowbar to the skull
will make me forget it.

02:58.723 --> 03:00.083
What d'you think?

03:00.083 --> 03:03.203
I wouldn't build your hopes up.
Besides which,

03:03.203 --> 03:07.203
you've already got the most
important

03:07.523 --> 03:11.523
job in the world, bringing up
little Miss Poo-poo Pants.

03:12.323 --> 03:15.083
Yay! Go to Daddy!

03:15.083 --> 03:19.083
That's more your style, lad.
Shit patrol.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.763 --> 03:39.363
What happened?

03:39.363 --> 03:42.803
I've got a strong personality.
Kids struggle with that.

03:42.803 --> 03:45.163
Which kids?

03:45.163 --> 03:47.043
I can't help if you won't tell me.

03:47.043 --> 03:51.043
You can't help anyway.

03:51.563 --> 03:54.323
There's a case of lager if you can
clear that before the council

03:54.323 --> 03:58.323
finds out what we've been dumping.

04:01.563 --> 04:05.563
All right, two cases of lager.

04:06.123 --> 04:08.643
So how would your colleagues
describe you?

04:08.643 --> 04:11.763
What? Oh, right, erm...

04:11.763 --> 04:14.683
well, no-one
really pays much attention to me.

04:14.683 --> 04:16.403
But this sales job would
change all that

04:16.403 --> 04:19.442
cos people respect you
if you're good at summat.

04:19.442 --> 04:21.442
What you doing?

04:21.442 --> 04:23.603
That's hanging, bro! Now smell it.

04:23.603 --> 04:24.643
No!

04:24.643 --> 04:25.683
Go on, give him a kiss!

04:25.683 --> 04:27.443
No, man!

04:27.443 --> 04:30.723
Just imagine, people thinking I done
all right, my wife looking at me,

04:30.723 --> 04:34.723
proud.

04:44.723 --> 04:48.403
Little bastards!

04:48.403 --> 04:52.403
I want to be more than
balls-deep in shit.

04:54.763 --> 04:58.723
You peddling hummus?

04:58.723 --> 05:01.163
It's a private matter, Mimi, so.

05:01.163 --> 05:04.363
When you going to spit it out or do
I have to go and listen to me

05:04.363 --> 05:08.363
wire in Vernon's office?

05:08.643 --> 05:11.163
Thalia's having problems
with other kids.

05:11.163 --> 05:12.683
Well, tell her to punch them.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.523
We're not fighting pitbulls!

05:14.523 --> 05:15.723
This is delicate, Mimi,

05:15.723 --> 05:19.723
and delicacy - no offence - isn't
really your thing, is it?

05:21.403 --> 05:24.923
She was happy till
we moved her here. I failed her.

05:24.923 --> 05:28.283
My son's been stoned for a year.
I know failure.

05:28.283 --> 05:30.123
There's no reason to pick on her.

05:30.123 --> 05:34.123
She's only been here a few months
and it's not like she's fat or ugly.

05:34.203 --> 05:38.203
We take bullying very seriously,
extremely seriously.

05:38.363 --> 05:42.363
It's just, we can't
do very much about it. So...

05:43.243 --> 05:46.603
I want something done, and if I have
to go to the papers, to the

05:46.603 --> 05:47.883
Education Department...

05:47.883 --> 05:50.843
No! No, no, no, no, no! You
misunderstand!

05:50.843 --> 05:53.163
Of course,
we'll do everything we can.

05:53.163 --> 05:56.883
There's Government grants for all
this anti-bullying caper.

05:56.883 --> 05:58.003
Mimi Tutton...

05:58.003 --> 05:59.723
Mimi Tutton?

05:59.723 --> 06:03.723
Bullying's right up her alley.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.483
What d'you know about sales?

06:11.483 --> 06:12.843
I've sold things before.

06:12.843 --> 06:16.283
Drugs, Billy, not security systems.

06:16.283 --> 06:19.643
Drugs, house alarms. Once you
get to know your product, you know

06:19.643 --> 06:21.043
how to sell it.

06:21.043 --> 06:22.643
I've got transferable skills!

06:22.643 --> 06:24.323
It's not like we need the money.

06:24.323 --> 06:25.443
It's not about the money.

06:25.443 --> 06:27.203
I'm supporting us
both fine, aren't I?

06:27.203 --> 06:28.243
Yeah, but...

06:28.243 --> 06:32.243
You don't want for nothing.

06:55.643 --> 06:59.443
There you go.

06:59.443 --> 07:01.043
You all right, love?

07:01.043 --> 07:04.963
I've got a job interview at ten
next door.

07:04.963 --> 07:06.443
Today's your day!

07:06.443 --> 07:09.003
Everyone expects me to fuck up.

07:09.003 --> 07:11.683
Try that thing where you imagine
the interviewer sitting

07:11.683 --> 07:15.683
on the toilet with their pants down,
like everybody else.

07:24.923 --> 07:28.923
Wait! What if it's a woman
and I get a stiffy?

07:31.643 --> 07:34.643
You're here cos you're all
little shits.

07:34.643 --> 07:36.403
You target the weak,

07:36.403 --> 07:40.403
the pitiful and that little bald
weirdo with the alopecia.

07:40.923 --> 07:44.723
Let me be clear.
I don't give two figs.

07:44.723 --> 07:47.843
But you gave Thalia Blanco
a proper shiner,

07:47.843 --> 07:51.843
and her mam's got a gob
the size of Africa.

07:52.003 --> 07:56.003
So who was it?

07:59.883 --> 08:03.883
Who was it?

08:12.203 --> 08:13.923
Thalia made fun of Jones.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.883
That kid with the bowel disorder?

08:15.883 --> 08:18.603
And he spazzed out and punched her!

08:18.603 --> 08:22.603
Let me get this straight, Thalia
Blanco bullied a vulnerable child?

08:29.443 --> 08:33.443
Aarghh!

08:34.243 --> 08:36.602
Fuck!

08:36.602 --> 08:38.763
Get out! And don't come back,

08:38.763 --> 08:41.163
you smack addict!

08:41.163 --> 08:45.163
Methadone, my balls!

08:45.363 --> 08:49.083
You all right, love?
Interview not go well, then?

08:49.083 --> 08:53.083
Not your day either, is it?

09:15.963 --> 09:19.763
We need to remember bullying hurts
everyone, not just the target,

09:19.763 --> 09:20.803
but the bully as well.

09:20.803 --> 09:23.123
Schools have a duty of care to
protect kids,

09:23.123 --> 09:25.163
and maybe that should
mean excluding bullies.

09:25.163 --> 09:27.563
Yeah, believe me, if it was that
easy to get rid of them...

09:27.563 --> 09:29.123
This is serious.

09:29.123 --> 09:30.523
Yes, of course it is.

09:30.523 --> 09:34.523
If Thalia engaged in bullying,
you'd support excluding her?

09:34.683 --> 09:35.723
100%.

09:35.723 --> 09:36.763
Are you sure?

09:36.763 --> 09:37.803
Yes!

09:37.803 --> 09:39.803
Thalia's a bully.

09:39.803 --> 09:40.843
What?

09:40.843 --> 09:43.643
The kids don't like her because
she...

09:43.643 --> 09:46.723
"repeatedly engages in planned

09:46.723 --> 09:50.723
"and orchestrated attempts
at character assassination".

09:51.523 --> 09:53.363
Oh dear!

09:53.363 --> 09:56.883
No, no! there must be a mistake.

09:56.883 --> 09:59.123
She wouldn't... she couldn't...

09:59.123 --> 10:00.963
She did.

10:00.963 --> 10:02.203
But...

10:02.203 --> 10:06.203
Esther, there's no need for denial
any more. We're not here to judge.

10:17.403 --> 10:20.403
Three full English,
table two please!

10:21.443 --> 10:23.203
Hey Billy?

10:23.203 --> 10:24.243
Yeah?

10:24.243 --> 10:28.243
You're doing fucking marvellous!

10:42.923 --> 10:44.043
I'm employed!

10:44.043 --> 10:45.083
Serious?

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
Serious! I'm a cook
in the cafe next door!

10:47.083 --> 10:48.603
You're a cook?

10:48.603 --> 10:50.803
Yeah. Make 150 squid a week!

10:50.803 --> 10:51.923
In cash.

10:51.923 --> 10:54.003
That's it?
And you have to go every day?

10:54.003 --> 10:55.043
Yeah, but...

10:55.043 --> 10:57.083
You're earning peanuts for
shovelling grease!

10:57.083 --> 11:01.083
Mimi'll proper respect you now!

11:07.123 --> 11:08.683
Oi!

11:08.683 --> 11:10.123
I look like a salesman, don't I?

11:10.123 --> 11:11.163
So?

11:11.163 --> 11:12.523
So who's to know any different?

11:12.523 --> 11:15.123
If I tell her I'm a salesman,
I'm a salesman, aren't I?

11:15.123 --> 11:18.523
Ha ha! Boosh!

11:18.523 --> 11:22.523
Ha ha!

11:30.683 --> 11:33.683
Mr Hard Lock Security
at your service!

11:33.683 --> 11:36.723
You're joking!
They hired you in a recession?

11:36.723 --> 11:40.723
With no skills, no experience,
no training, you got a job?

11:40.723 --> 11:43.363
I blew the fucking roof off, babe!
Boosh!

12:36.633 --> 12:39.313
I'm Billy Tutton...

12:39.313 --> 12:43.313
..and I'm a cook.

12:51.233 --> 12:53.913
What are you doing out
here on your own, love?

12:53.913 --> 12:57.913
Frank nicked me keys.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.473
What's that?

13:08.473 --> 13:11.433
Oh, it's broken.
It's stuck on this channel.

13:11.433 --> 13:15.433
It's foreign. Aerobics channel.

13:18.593 --> 13:21.273
You haven't been
impersonating some poor

13:21.273 --> 13:24.073
girl as The Minger from Notre Dame?

13:24.073 --> 13:28.073
But she is a minger.
Wait, I've got a picture.

13:28.593 --> 13:31.313
OK, she's not very pretty,
but that's not the point!

13:31.382 --> 13:33.902
Thalia,
you shouldn't make fun of people!

13:33.984 --> 13:35.364
- You do.
- I do not!

13:35.455 --> 13:37.095
Yes, you do!

13:37.095 --> 13:40.115
Come anywhere near me with that knob
and I'll rag it off you

13:40.143 --> 13:44.143
and I'll ram it up yer arse!

13:45.048 --> 13:49.048
Oh Derrilee, Sherrilee, Sherrilee...

13:51.968 --> 13:54.728
Anybody seen me bloody glasses?

13:54.890 --> 13:58.050
Ah, well, yes but...

13:58.050 --> 14:00.930
it was wrong. If someone's ugly,

14:00.930 --> 14:04.930
don't point it out. Just say how
nice her dress is instead.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.850
What if her dress is minging, too?

14:06.850 --> 14:10.850
Just say it's pretty anyway!
It's the teeniest lie.

14:11.210 --> 14:15.210
The truth's the truth, isn't it?

14:18.890 --> 14:20.770
There you go.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.570
What, really? I can have 'em?

14:22.570 --> 14:26.570
Three days after the sell-by date,
but if you cook 'em well...

14:30.250 --> 14:32.250
You all right, love?

14:32.250 --> 14:36.250
It's nothing, just...

14:36.410 --> 14:40.410
..thanks.

14:42.810 --> 14:46.810
Six across. The Egyptian President,
died 1970?

14:50.570 --> 14:53.970
Sheik Kebab.

14:53.970 --> 14:56.090
How d'you spell it?

14:56.090 --> 14:59.370
Any way you want, love.
Nobody can know everything.

14:59.370 --> 15:03.370
Aarghh! Nits, Lillian! Bloody nits!

15:05.930 --> 15:08.690
See, what you've got to make
clear to the client is

15:08.690 --> 15:11.250
you're not selling security.
You're selling peace of mind.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.610
And can you put a price on that?

15:13.610 --> 15:16.930
But you're not selling security.
You're flipping eggs.

15:16.930 --> 15:20.930
This job has changed my life.
Maybe I should buy cufflinks.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.970
D'you have a shirt that
needs cufflinks?

15:23.970 --> 15:26.530
No, but just the thought of buying
'em makes me feel proud,

15:26.530 --> 15:29.050
like I'm a man who needs cufflinks.

15:29.171 --> 15:30.211
But you don't need 'em!

15:30.211 --> 15:32.251
You don't have a shirt
cos you don't have the job!

15:32.251 --> 15:35.171
Yeah, but nobody knows that, do they?

15:35.171 --> 15:37.091
I made it, all right?

15:37.091 --> 15:41.091
Billy Tutton has finally
become a man.

15:50.411 --> 15:54.411
So talk me through how you do it.
Sell me security.

15:56.611 --> 16:00.251
Once you've got 'em sold on cameras,
you can flog 'em dead bolts,

16:00.251 --> 16:04.251
window guards. Give the windows
a shake and look grave.

16:06.771 --> 16:09.811
Shitting themselves is exactly
where you want 'em.

16:09.811 --> 16:11.531
I get 'em shitting their pants,

16:11.531 --> 16:15.531
I shake the windows and
then look grave.

16:18.531 --> 16:22.411
You look fitter than James Bond
in that suit. Lucky me, eh?

16:22.411 --> 16:26.331
I've got me
very own Hard Cock consultant.

16:36.171 --> 16:40.171
I had started believing, y'know,
that I might actually be nothing.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.651
A nobody.

16:43.651 --> 16:47.651
Having a job doesn't make you
somebody. You do that.

16:48.011 --> 16:52.011
Well, how am I somebody?

16:55.051 --> 16:59.051
Well, you've got a heart
the size of a horse, you pillock.

17:01.611 --> 17:03.651
You mean...

17:03.651 --> 17:07.371
it wouldn't matter
if I didn't have the job, the suit,

17:07.371 --> 17:09.171
just me'd be enough?

17:09.171 --> 17:13.171
I loved you penniless in trainers,
didn't I?

17:18.290 --> 17:21.771
Nice having the new car, though, eh?

17:21.771 --> 17:25.771
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the car...

18:14.971 --> 18:17.371
What you playing at? A car?

18:17.371 --> 18:19.771
Well, how am I supposed to make my
sales without wheels?

18:19.771 --> 18:21.611
Billy,
you're not a fucking salesman!

18:21.611 --> 18:24.331
That's why I'm only renting it.
It's just a midrange hatchback,

18:24.331 --> 18:25.731
nothing flash.

18:25.731 --> 18:26.771
How much?

18:26.771 --> 18:27.891
200 quid a week.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.331
You only make 150!

18:29.331 --> 18:31.691
What's the point in being a hotshot
salesman if I'm not flush with cash?

18:31.691 --> 18:32.931
But you're not flush with cash!

18:32.956 --> 18:36.956
I know that, Einstein! I've got to
project an image of success, han't I?

18:41.196 --> 18:42.356
Can I come in?

18:42.356 --> 18:46.316
Oh, sorry, pet,
but kids are full of filth.

18:46.316 --> 18:49.076
And I can't have that in my brothel.

18:49.076 --> 18:53.036
Sorry.

18:53.036 --> 18:55.076
Your best champagne.

18:55.076 --> 18:56.876
Not got any.

18:56.876 --> 18:57.916
Lager then.

18:57.916 --> 19:00.436
He's got a car now.
I'm wet with excitement.

19:00.436 --> 19:03.516
I'll have a lager
and a double vodka chaser on Billy,

19:03.516 --> 19:05.156
seeing as you're flush with cash.

19:05.156 --> 19:06.516
Drinks on Billy!

19:08.796 --> 19:11.756
Nice to see a Chatsworth lad making
something of himself,

19:11.756 --> 19:15.756
not like the rest of you inbred,
lazy fucks.

19:17.316 --> 19:18.436
What you doing?

19:18.436 --> 19:21.196
For the drinks.

19:21.283 --> 19:22.803
You're fucked now, Billyboy.

19:22.803 --> 19:26.403
You're going to have to rob
a bank to keep this up.

19:26.403 --> 19:27.923
'Have to rob a bank to keep
this up.'

19:27.923 --> 19:31.923
'Have to rob a bank to keep
this up.'

19:35.923 --> 19:37.043
Really, though?

19:37.043 --> 19:41.043
Well, where else are you
going to get it from?

19:41.923 --> 19:43.923
You don't use your keys, you dick.

19:43.923 --> 19:47.923
Well, how else are we
going to get in?

19:52.443 --> 19:56.443
Like that.

20:00.483 --> 20:04.483
Stop messing about!
Start acting like a burglar!

20:05.843 --> 20:06.883
What you doing?!

20:06.883 --> 20:09.083
Burglars don't respect property,
do they?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.003
My aunt Harriet gave us
that for our wedding!

20:11.003 --> 20:13.443
Well, seeing as the burglar don't
know your Aunt Harriet,

20:13.443 --> 20:14.883
he wouldn't give a fuck, would he?

20:14.883 --> 20:16.003
Me keeping it real's well going to
save our arse!

20:16.003 --> 20:17.923
Right, right, right!
Make it look real,

20:17.923 --> 20:20.283
just hurry the fuck up about it!

20:20.283 --> 20:22.043
Maybe I should just shit on the bed?

20:22.043 --> 20:23.083
No!

20:23.083 --> 20:24.563
Well, piss in the sink?

20:24.563 --> 20:26.923
Making it real means cash,
jewellery,

20:26.923 --> 20:30.923
things people would steal.

20:40.203 --> 20:42.083
What you doing? I said no pissing!

20:42.083 --> 20:46.083
You said not in the sink.
This is just the hallway.

20:54.443 --> 20:56.043
"Lie," she says!

20:56.043 --> 20:57.083
What happened?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.323
I did just as you said!

20:58.323 --> 21:00.403
I said be nice to people.
How were you nice?

21:00.403 --> 21:02.803
I told Stuart that Bec
probably liked him

21:02.803 --> 21:05.403
cos he likes her. He were well happy.

21:05.403 --> 21:06.723
What's wrong with that?

21:06.723 --> 21:09.363
Bec kicked him in the balls
when he tried to kiss her.

21:09.363 --> 21:10.803
So she doesn't like him?

21:10.803 --> 21:14.803
Course not! He's a skidmark! But how
d'you think Stuart now feels?

21:15.563 --> 21:17.603
This is how he feels!

21:17.603 --> 21:21.603
You are a terrible mother.

21:29.843 --> 21:32.243
Almost two grand. I'm laughing.

21:32.243 --> 21:33.683
Right, what we're going to do

21:33.683 --> 21:35.963
is keep the gear here
till it's safe to move and...

21:35.963 --> 21:38.323
You'll have to find somewhere else
to put all this shit.

21:38.323 --> 21:42.323
You'd have to be a fucking idiot
to want any of it.

21:46.363 --> 21:47.763
Can you not go any faster?

21:47.763 --> 21:49.483
My legs are shorter than yours.

21:49.483 --> 21:50.883
Just make yours go quicker!

21:50.883 --> 21:54.883
Fuck off!

22:12.323 --> 22:13.363
You all right?

22:13.363 --> 22:14.403
You all right?

22:14.403 --> 22:18.403
You all right?

22:34.243 --> 22:36.083
I heard you need a new TV.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.123
No.

22:37.123 --> 22:41.123
Cos yours is stuck on foreign
aerobics?

22:41.283 --> 22:45.283
Just take it! Early Christmas!

22:52.043 --> 22:56.043
Since I got you a new TV,
maybe we could be friends?

23:31.563 --> 23:33.723
Come on. It's OK.

23:33.723 --> 23:37.723
No, Billy, it's not OK.

23:37.843 --> 23:41.043
I had no idea that locket meant
so much to you.

23:41.043 --> 23:43.963
It's the only thing me
mam ever gave to me,

23:43.963 --> 23:46.763
the only good memory of her
that I've got.

23:46.763 --> 23:48.843
When I find the fucker
who did this...

23:48.843 --> 23:51.723
It's in the past now, babe.
Just forget it.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.563
I'll never forget this, Billy.

23:53.563 --> 23:56.243
Someone has taken a massive
dump on our lives.

23:56.243 --> 23:58.683
It was just a little piss.
I got the Febreze straight on it.

23:58.683 --> 24:02.683
When I find the fucker
who's done this,

24:03.003 --> 24:07.257
I'll rip him apart,
limb from fucking limb.

24:16.412 --> 24:19.052
How did they know
where the money was?

24:19.062 --> 24:21.902
Tonight's about emptying
your mind of worries.

24:21.989 --> 24:23.509
Turn this shite off.

24:23.509 --> 24:27.509
It's more irritating than
a bloody yeast infection.

24:37.069 --> 24:38.909
It's someone who knows us.

24:38.909 --> 24:42.909
Who knows we wouldn't be home,
knows we've got cash.

24:43.469 --> 24:47.149
I bet it's one of those
bastards from the Jockey.

24:47.149 --> 24:50.909
Can't we just pretend
like none of this happened?

24:50.909 --> 24:54.909
Probably bought the fucker a drink.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.309
Well, drink up, sunshine.

24:58.309 --> 25:01.349
Because you'll be lucky
to shit through a straw

25:01.349 --> 25:04.509
when my boys are finished with ya.

25:04.509 --> 25:07.909
Just forget it now.
You'll never find them.

25:07.909 --> 25:09.029
We'll find them.

25:09.029 --> 25:12.109
If we have to rough up
every scroat from here to China.

25:12.109 --> 25:16.109
We'll find them.

25:53.629 --> 25:55.109
They know!

25:55.109 --> 25:56.349
Who knows?

25:56.349 --> 25:57.709
Jamie and Shane - we're fucked!

25:57.709 --> 25:59.949
If they knew, Mimi'd know,
and we'd already be dead.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.669
If I could just give her
back the locket.

26:01.669 --> 26:03.509
Oh, yeah,
sign your own death warrant?

26:03.509 --> 26:05.229
Say I found it in the house
somewhere.

26:05.229 --> 26:07.229
The burglars dropped
it on their way out.

26:07.229 --> 26:11.229
So now we're not just burglars,
we're shit burglars? Sound!

26:12.869 --> 26:13.749
Where is it?

26:13.749 --> 26:15.709
Maybe you did drop it,
you useless dick.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.669
Don't call me useless!
Anyway, you call this secure?

26:18.669 --> 26:20.949
I'm not the cunt who
works in security, am I?

26:20.949 --> 26:23.349
Just dump the lot somewhere
no-one'll ever find it.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.549
Dump it? So I take all the risk
hiding the stuff,

26:25.549 --> 26:27.389
and now I'm supposed
to walk away with nothing?

26:27.389 --> 26:28.469
What do you want?

26:28.469 --> 26:30.029
A grand.

26:30.029 --> 26:31.429
Fuck off! That's my wife's money!

26:31.429 --> 26:35.429
Which we stole 50/50.

26:38.629 --> 26:40.789
That's not even a hundred quid!

26:40.789 --> 26:44.789
Please, just get rid of it
or we're dead.

26:44.829 --> 26:47.189
But it has to be
someone from round here.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.149
Or how'd they know
to target our house?

26:49.149 --> 26:51.309
We've tried all the usual
suspects. Nothing.

26:51.309 --> 26:54.109
Salmonella Sam's screwing some bird
that's not his wife,

26:54.109 --> 26:57.069
but he definitely didn't rob ya,
and he doesn't know who did.

26:57.069 --> 26:58.909
Steal the biscuits as well,
did they?

26:58.909 --> 27:00.549
It's probably just kids.

27:00.549 --> 27:01.669
How do you reckon that?

27:01.669 --> 27:03.949
It's hardly some mastermind
criminal, is it?

27:03.949 --> 27:06.389
What sort of fucking idiot
steals a toaster?

27:06.389 --> 27:08.189
It's the place mats that get me!

27:08.189 --> 27:09.989
Might have been a fucking idiot

27:09.989 --> 27:13.989
but looks like he's got away with it,
and right under your noses.

27:14.829 --> 27:16.589
What? I'm just saying.

27:16.589 --> 27:19.189
I've tried every pawn shop
in Manchester.

27:19.189 --> 27:20.949
No-one's tried to shift the gear.

27:20.949 --> 27:24.309
No-one's used the money to pay
off any debts or buy anything flash.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.749
Maybe we should just
move on now, eh, babe?

27:26.749 --> 27:27.949
Put it behind us.

27:27.949 --> 27:30.909
Not till I feel safe again
in me own home.

27:30.909 --> 27:33.389
Get Hard Lock round,
I want the works.

27:33.389 --> 27:34.789
Hard Lock?

27:34.789 --> 27:38.789
Security so tight
even a fart can't slip out.

27:40.509 --> 27:41.789
You've done your best

27:41.789 --> 27:44.829
but my social alienation
is bigger than both of us.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.789
We need to talk solutions.

27:47.789 --> 27:49.389
Home school.

27:49.389 --> 27:50.949
No, Thalia.

27:50.949 --> 27:54.509
Just until I'm 18 and then I'll move
to Israel, where I'll be safe.

27:54.509 --> 27:57.149
Home school kids
are friendless freaks.

27:57.149 --> 27:59.189
I am a friendless freak!

27:59.189 --> 28:03.189
Why do you think they call me
"Saddo Saddo No Friends Blanco?"

28:06.509 --> 28:10.509
You are a great kid and
you will make friends, I promise.

28:11.029 --> 28:14.189
Even the bald kid has more status.

28:14.189 --> 28:16.829
You do impressions of people
and make friends,

28:16.829 --> 28:19.029
but when I do it, they hate me.

28:19.029 --> 28:23.029
But I don't do it to their faces.
So I don't hurt their feelings.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.749
So that make's it all right?

28:24.749 --> 28:26.589
No! That's not what I meant.

28:26.589 --> 28:28.909
I'm honest and upfront

28:28.909 --> 28:32.909
and you sneak around being cruel
to people behind their backs.

28:36.549 --> 28:40.549
You know what... You're right.

28:40.749 --> 28:44.149
Maybe we both need to say sorry.

28:44.149 --> 28:45.989
What can I get you?

28:45.989 --> 28:47.469
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

28:47.469 --> 28:51.069
What for?

28:51.069 --> 28:54.469
I do this impression of you
behind your back.

28:54.469 --> 28:57.429
I'm not proud of myself
and I want to apologise.

28:57.429 --> 28:58.789
Impression?

28:58.789 --> 29:02.669
The point is, I'm sorry
and it won't happen again.

29:02.669 --> 29:04.589
Wait a minute.

29:04.589 --> 29:06.109
What?

29:06.109 --> 29:07.869
Show me.

29:07.869 --> 29:10.629
Show you? No, I'm not doing that.

29:10.629 --> 29:14.629
Come on.
I can take a joke, can't I?

29:14.749 --> 29:15.989
What can I get you?

29:15.989 --> 29:18.429
Fuck's sake, Karen,
I can take a joke, can't I?

29:18.429 --> 29:22.429
And then you do your nostril thing.

29:23.469 --> 29:27.469
See! You're doing it right now!

29:29.069 --> 29:32.029
Yeah. Good one.

29:32.029 --> 29:36.029
People want to forgive, Thalia.
They just need to know you're sorry.

29:37.549 --> 29:40.509
I started in the biz
doing impressions.

29:40.509 --> 29:44.509
Go on, then, let's
see what you can do!

29:46.829 --> 29:50.829
Voice of an angel,
me. Beyonce can rim me!

29:56.229 --> 29:59.789
As I said, I'm very sorry.

29:59.789 --> 30:01.749
They can't refuse
a mosque

30:01.749 --> 30:04.469
cos little fat skinheads march
from one dole office to another,

30:04.469 --> 30:08.469
the bald little twats.

30:13.229 --> 30:17.229
That went well.

30:22.589 --> 30:24.309
Can I come in?

30:24.309 --> 30:28.309
No, pet.

30:28.749 --> 30:32.749
Oh, you shouldn't have, sweetheart.
Thank you.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.149
Now can we be friends?

30:35.149 --> 30:38.429
You need friends your age
or you'll end up a weirdo.

30:38.429 --> 30:42.429
And believe me, I know.

30:46.269 --> 30:50.269
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

30:52.429 --> 30:56.429
Aghh! Fuck!

30:57.189 --> 31:00.589
So how much did all this cost?

31:00.589 --> 31:04.589
Two cameras, hard locks for the
front and back door, and this.

31:10.829 --> 31:14.429
Er, about 800 quid.

31:14.429 --> 31:16.069
Isn't that your car?

31:16.069 --> 31:20.069
What?

31:20.349 --> 31:24.069
Fuck!

31:24.069 --> 31:25.269
Fuck!

31:25.269 --> 31:29.269
Billy.

31:34.669 --> 31:36.029
Where you going, bro?!

31:36.029 --> 31:37.709
You should've kept up the payments.

31:38.949 --> 31:42.949
That's my car, you dick! Aghh!

31:43.229 --> 31:44.989
That your car?

31:44.989 --> 31:46.989
Yeah, it's just
going in for a checkup.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.149
Oh. Surprise!

31:49.149 --> 31:52.429
Welcome to your newly-secured home.
Got the Hard Lock crew in today.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.789
If it weren't for Billy,
I'd have gone mad.

32:06.789 --> 32:08.309
Nah, I haven't done much really.

32:08.309 --> 32:12.309
You've been a bloody rock, staying
calm, fixing up the house safe.

32:14.589 --> 32:17.909
I'd have pummelled the first scally
I thought looked at me funny.

32:17.909 --> 32:19.629
Could be somebody we know.

32:19.629 --> 32:23.629
Maybe even someone here.

32:28.869 --> 32:31.228
- What can I get you, darlin'?
- Vodka and coke, please.

32:33.669 --> 32:34.949
Where d'you get that?

32:34.949 --> 32:35.789
What?

32:35.789 --> 32:37.189
That's me ma's locket!

32:37.189 --> 32:40.909
What? What you on about? Get off me!

32:40.909 --> 32:42.349
Where d'you get it?!

32:42.349 --> 32:45.869
No lies or I'll have
your twat on a barbeque.

32:45.869 --> 32:49.869
Where d'you get it?

33:23.349 --> 33:25.349
What d'you know about this?

33:25.349 --> 33:26.629
My locket?

33:26.629 --> 33:27.909
No! My locket!

33:27.909 --> 33:31.109
Is she giving 'em to everyone?
I thought I was special.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.349
That's my TV!

33:33.349 --> 33:35.269
Who gave it to you?

33:35.269 --> 33:36.909
You can't be angry with her.
She didn't mean...

33:36.909 --> 33:40.229
- Who?
- Stella.

33:40.229 --> 33:43.309
A six-year-old didn't
smash my front door open.

33:43.309 --> 33:46.109
Or carry that.

33:46.109 --> 33:48.269
- Where d'you think you're going?
- I didn't do anything!

33:48.269 --> 33:50.509
Ey? Then why the fuck
are you scarpering then, eh?

33:50.509 --> 33:53.909
You stole from me? From your friend?

33:53.909 --> 33:55.189
Billy?

33:55.189 --> 33:58.909
That's the lowest,
most despicable... Break his arm.

33:58.909 --> 34:01.949
Billy made me!

34:01.949 --> 34:04.949
Why would me own husband
steal from me?

34:04.949 --> 34:08.949
Tell him, Billy. He's insulted you,
he's insulted me.

34:09.509 --> 34:13.509
Tell him.

34:19.469 --> 34:23.469
You wouldn't, I know you wouldn't.

34:33.309 --> 34:35.829
Babe, babe.

34:35.829 --> 34:37.949
Babe, just stop!

34:50.549 --> 34:53.469
Why?

34:53.469 --> 34:57.469
Cos... Like, when you think
of the great men in history.

34:57.869 --> 35:01.749
like Martin Luther King,
Winston Churchill, Roy Keane.

35:01.749 --> 35:03.389
What the fuck you on about?

35:03.389 --> 35:06.949
They stood for something!
They did... things.

35:06.949 --> 35:08.749
That's why I became a salesman.

35:08.749 --> 35:11.029
Well, a cook.

35:11.029 --> 35:14.109
Is anything you've told me true?

35:14.109 --> 35:16.429
I love you.

35:16.429 --> 35:19.429
I believed in you, Billy,
you fucking idiot!

35:19.429 --> 35:20.709
I know, babe, I'm sorry.

35:20.709 --> 35:24.709
Even though I knew I shouldn't.
You, a salesman? You?

35:24.829 --> 35:28.829
I just wanted to show you, the way
you looked at me when you thought...

35:30.149 --> 35:34.149
It felt good, like, I might be a man.

35:35.829 --> 35:39.669
Anytime you wanna be a man,
Billy, you know what you have to do?

35:39.669 --> 35:42.807
Don't play at it. Just be one.

35:57.794 --> 36:01.794
If it isn't the littlest Supreme!
This an encore performance?

36:02.874 --> 36:06.434
What do you know
about living with bipolar?

36:06.434 --> 36:10.434
And then I guess, Dad went inside,
she just lost the plot, you know?

36:12.194 --> 36:14.434
And then that's when
she went off her meds

36:14.434 --> 36:18.434
and the drinking really started.

36:18.714 --> 36:22.154
I think when she started
sleeping with Frank for comfort.

36:22.154 --> 36:25.754
Oh! Allah be merciful.

36:25.754 --> 36:27.394
Yeah.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.994
Rock bottom.

36:29.994 --> 36:32.434
But she'd never ever have done it

36:32.434 --> 36:34.914
if she hadn't been
completely off her tree,

36:34.914 --> 36:38.914
so can you forgive her?

36:59.594 --> 37:01.834
So you got my things back?

37:01.834 --> 37:03.394
Most of 'em.

37:03.394 --> 37:06.314
Can't even fucking do that right.

37:06.314 --> 37:09.794
Didn't have to bother
with the juicer - it never worked.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.234
It does now.

37:11.234 --> 37:15.234
I fixed it.

37:16.354 --> 37:19.594
I'm going to pay the rest back
in instalments.

37:19.594 --> 37:23.554
I think we should...
live apart for a while.

37:23.554 --> 37:27.554
I need...space.

37:38.514 --> 37:42.434
This is the life, innit?

37:42.434 --> 37:46.194
A night in with the lads -
a few beers, a few laughs.

37:50.794 --> 37:52.954
I bet she expects me
to come crawling back.

37:52.954 --> 37:56.314
You know, slither in on my belly,
beg her for forgiveness.

37:56.314 --> 37:59.474
Never apologise, never explain -
words to live by.

37:59.474 --> 38:02.194
Well, I tried to explain,
but she wouldn't listen.

38:02.194 --> 38:04.714
So try again -
women love persistence.

38:04.714 --> 38:06.234
Calling your right hand Sue

38:06.234 --> 38:09.594
doesn't make you an expert
on feminine nature.

38:09.594 --> 38:13.154
I'm a master of my own destiny
at last, answering to no-one.

38:13.154 --> 38:14.634
This is my opportunity to grow.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.994
Wonderful! Now fuck off and grow
somewhere quietly, I've got company.

38:21.674 --> 38:25.674
Ah! We meet again, my Pussy Galores.

38:25.714 --> 38:29.714
Ready to shake
and stir your cocktini!

38:42.914 --> 38:46.194
It's none of my business,
but are you OK?

38:46.194 --> 38:50.194
It's none of your business.

38:53.194 --> 38:55.634
You don't ever hear a woman say that,
do you?

38:55.634 --> 38:59.474
"I fucked up but it's all your fault
cos I didn't feel woman enough."

38:59.474 --> 39:00.794
Bollocks!

39:00.794 --> 39:03.794
What use is "sorry" anyway?
Nothing ever gets wiped clean.

39:03.794 --> 39:06.114
Then they disappear
before you can leave 'em first.

39:06.114 --> 39:10.034
Am I meant to apologise
for being a strong woman?

39:10.034 --> 39:14.034
Well, he can shove his sorrys
up his good-for-nothing arse.

39:14.034 --> 39:15.394
Fuck him!

39:15.394 --> 39:16.114
Fuck him.

39:16.114 --> 39:20.114
Fuck him!

40:05.674 --> 40:09.674
On the house.

40:10.394 --> 40:13.354
Mental illness
is nothing to be ashamed of.

40:13.354 --> 40:14.714
It's...not?

40:14.714 --> 40:17.034
Thalia, don't be angry with her.

40:17.034 --> 40:20.074
The way she's holding up,
she's a little trouper.

40:20.074 --> 40:21.994
She's told us
what you've been through.

40:21.994 --> 40:25.994
We are all 100% behind you.

40:31.154 --> 40:35.154
I'll get a drink.

40:38.994 --> 40:41.394
If you've got
a psychiatric disorder,

40:41.394 --> 40:44.594
people are falling over themselves
being understanding!

40:44.594 --> 40:47.634
But did you have to say
I was bipolar?

40:47.634 --> 40:50.674
You can't always lie your way
out of trouble, you know.

40:50.674 --> 40:53.394
I know,
but they felt so sorry for you.

40:53.394 --> 40:57.394
And you should have seen their faces
when I said you were shagging Frank.

40:58.114 --> 41:01.194
What?

41:01.194 --> 41:04.194
Billy said I should return...

41:04.194 --> 41:08.194
Actually, it was more my idea but...

41:20.354 --> 41:22.114
Celery and kiwi.

41:22.114 --> 41:26.114
I've got into juicing.

41:26.674 --> 41:28.874
I'm sorry about...you know.

41:28.874 --> 41:31.514
The piss in the hallway was
only meant for it to be realistic.

41:31.514 --> 41:35.154
There was no...bad feelings
behind it.

41:35.154 --> 41:38.914
I'm completely on your side, you're
better off without that dumb prick.

41:38.914 --> 41:40.314
I told Billy from the beginning,

41:40.314 --> 41:43.354
"Mimi's not going to be impressed
by sales."

41:43.354 --> 41:47.354
So the only reason he went for
that job was to try and impress me?

41:47.434 --> 41:50.354
And then the thick twat got himself
in deeper by renting a car.

41:50.354 --> 41:53.674
Of course he couldn't afford it
on his cook's salary.

41:53.674 --> 41:57.074
He really is a cook?

41:57.074 --> 42:01.074
So the only solution he's got
is to rob from his own house.

42:07.474 --> 42:10.394
Table number six
says compliments to the chef.

42:10.394 --> 42:11.634
It was only beans on toast.

42:11.634 --> 42:13.834
Well, how did you do the beans?

42:13.834 --> 42:15.834
In the microwave.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.954
Must've been the way
you spooned 'em.

42:18.954 --> 42:22.954
Yes, darling...coffee?

42:36.354 --> 42:38.354
You look cute as a chef.

42:38.354 --> 42:41.074
I like it better than the suit.

42:41.074 --> 42:42.634
If you'll let me explain...

42:42.634 --> 42:45.994
I know I'm just a cook,
but I'm good at it.

42:45.994 --> 42:48.434
It means a lot to me,
to be good at something,

42:48.434 --> 42:49.714
and if you just listened...

42:49.714 --> 42:53.714
Billy, shut up.

42:53.794 --> 42:56.874
Do you know why I need you?

42:56.874 --> 42:58.674
Because you're the only thing
in my life

42:58.674 --> 43:01.154
that makes me feel like a woman.

43:01.154 --> 43:05.154
Not a mum or an old carcass
to be tossed on the scrap heap.

43:06.954 --> 43:10.954
You make me feel beautiful.

43:12.194 --> 43:14.554
You don't ever have to lie to me.

43:14.554 --> 43:16.594
Cos when I look at you,
I don't see nothing.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.594
I see the person who saved me
and keeps saving me.

43:22.234 --> 43:25.074
That doesn't mean that what you did
wasn't stupid,

43:25.074 --> 43:28.994
but you don't see many men
putting in that kind of effort

43:28.994 --> 43:32.994
to impress their woman, do you?

43:40.794 --> 43:44.274
You know what this is?

43:44.274 --> 43:46.114
What?

43:46.114 --> 43:50.114
This is what it feels like
when you've made it.

43:57.434 --> 43:59.474
Lucia, this is my wife.

43:59.474 --> 44:01.274
Hey!

44:01.274 --> 44:02.874
Hiya. Nice to meet you.

44:02.874 --> 44:03.994
I've heard a lot about you.

44:03.994 --> 44:06.354
The guys, Jeff, Tom...

44:06.354 --> 44:10.154
'Growing up? I guess it's about
making your own way.

44:10.154 --> 44:14.154
'Knowing what you've got
and what you need.'

44:14.914 --> 44:15.954
Ahem!

44:15.954 --> 44:17.354
'Saying you're wrong

44:17.354 --> 44:20.194
'when you'd rather
say nothing at all.

44:20.194 --> 44:22.154
'Or maybe the secret to growing up

44:22.154 --> 44:26.154
'is knowing when it's OK
to let someone else look after you.

44:26.154 --> 44:28.314
'Those two versions of yourself -

44:28.314 --> 44:31.074
'who you are
and who you'd like to be.

44:31.074 --> 44:35.074
'I guess you're a success when
they come a little closer together.

44:36.114 --> 44:38.834
'When you can look at yourself
and say,

44:38.834 --> 44:42.834
'"I know who I am and it's OK."

44:43.874 --> 44:45.090
'"I'm OK."'

44:50.598 --> 44:53.838
- It's your big chance, kid.
- Her days of karaoke might be over.

44:53.838 --> 44:55.998
- Louis!
- Pat!

44:55.998 --> 44:58.638
- So you stole the money?
- Yeah, I stole it.

44:58.638 --> 45:00.238
Fuck are you playing at?!

45:00.238 --> 45:02.358
- You're barred.
- What?

45:02.358 --> 45:03.838
I want you to kidnap my daughter.

45:03.838 --> 45:05.678
We should never have taken it.

45:05.678 --> 45:09.158
This is all you fucking care about!

45:09.158 --> 45:12.598
Don't! Oh!

45:12.598 --> 45:14.438
Also a funny story...

45:14.438 --> 45:16.181
Fucking pervert!
