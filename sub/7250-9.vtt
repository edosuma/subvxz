03:59.781 --> 04:02.034

04:02.076 --> 04:04.327
YOU'D ASK FOR ME,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.121
CLAIM YOU WERE DRIVING

04:04.369 --> 04:06.121
THROUGH A TUNNEL,

04:06.163 --> 04:09.208
SO YOU GET CUT OFF, AND MAKE

04:12.836 --> 04:14.838
YOU'VE BEEN SICK PAST TWO

04:12.836 --> 04:14.838
FRIDAYS FOR DINNER.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.591
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T COME,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.591
RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU WERE SICK?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.509
SO ARE YOU BETTER?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.509

04:28.810 --> 04:30.896
I WANT YOU TO COME

04:28.810 --> 04:30.896
TO DINNER TOMORROW.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.606
TOMORROW?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.606
TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.315
YES, IT IS THANKSGIVING.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.860
AND BEFORE YOU SIFT THROUGH

04:34.357 --> 04:36.860
THE DOZEN OR SO EXCUSES

04:36.902 --> 04:39.404
YOU ALWAYS HAVE ON HAND,

04:36.902 --> 04:39.404
LET ME HAVE MY SAY.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.573
YOU'VE MISSED TWO DINNERS

04:39.446 --> 04:41.573
AND AVOIDED MY CALLS

04:41.615 --> 04:44.159
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAD AT US ABOUT

04:41.615 --> 04:44.159
WHAT HAPPENED AT YALE.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.870
BUT I WANT YOU AND RORY

04:44.201 --> 04:46.870
AT THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.039
IF YOU HAVE PLANS...

04:46.912 --> 04:49.039
WE DO HAVE PLANS.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.249
...ALTER THEM.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.541
THERE'LL BE OTHER PEOPLE THERE,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.460
SO THE FOCUS

04:51.583 --> 04:53.460
WON'T BE ON YOU.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.004
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET BY

04:53.501 --> 04:56.004
WITHOUT SAYING MORE

04:56.046 --> 04:57.923
THAN "HELLO," "GOODBYE,"

04:56.046 --> 04:57.923
AND "PASS THE GRAVY ."

04:57.965 --> 05:01.218
WE ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.218
YOUR FATHER AND I

04:57.965 --> 05:01.218
ARE GOING OUTTA TOWN

05:01.260 --> 05:03.553
AND WE'LL BE GONE ALL OF

05:01.260 --> 05:03.553
DECEMBER, INCLUDING CHRISTMAS.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.641
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE FOR

05:03.595 --> 05:07.641
THE FAMILY TO BE TOGETHER

05:03.595 --> 05:07.641
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.145
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO

05:07.682 --> 05:11.145
SET THE MEETING FOR RORY

05:07.682 --> 05:11.145
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.896
I WANT YOU THERE, LORELAI.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.690
AND IF YOU'RE STILL SICK, I

05:12.938 --> 05:15.690
DON'T WANT A DOCTOR'S NOTE.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.235
I WANT YOUR DOCTOR HIMSELF

05:15.732 --> 05:18.235
TO COME TO MY HOUSE

05:18.277 --> 05:20.279
AND CONVINCE ME THAT

05:18.277 --> 05:20.279
IT'S TRUE. GOT IT?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.404
GOT IT.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.283
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.763
THAT WAS REALLY

05:44.845 --> 05:46.763
DISTRACTING.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.515
OH, WELL, BY ALL MEANS,

05:46.805 --> 05:48.515
MADELINE,

05:48.556 --> 05:50.809
POINT OUT TO THE FACULTY

05:48.556 --> 05:50.809
THAT THEIR ANNOYING CUSTOM

05:50.851 --> 05:53.103
OF TEACHING IS DISTRACTING YOU

05:50.851 --> 05:53.103
FROM MORE IMPORTANT THINGS,

05:53.145 --> 05:55.897
LIKE NAIL FILING AND DAYDREAMING

05:53.145 --> 05:55.897
ABOUT MARRYING RYAN PHILLIPPE.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.484
AAH. HE'S ALREADY MARRIED.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.484
THEN WHATEVER

05:55.939 --> 05:59.484
STRAWHEAD ACTOR ISN'T.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.861
FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES,

06:00.902 --> 06:03.113
EVERY SINGLE THING SHE SAID

06:00.902 --> 06:03.113
SOUNDED DIRTY.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.157
YEAH, SAME HERE.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.157
GOOD GOD.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.992
I MEAN, RETICULUM --

06:05.199 --> 06:06.992
COME ON.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.161
AND PLUS THE GOLGI BODY --

06:09.203 --> 06:11.205
IS IT ME, OR IS THAT

06:09.203 --> 06:11.205
MAJORLY PORNOGRAPHIC?

06:11.246 --> 06:12.747
MY LIFE WITH

06:11.246 --> 06:12.747
THE BANGER SISTERS.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.749
SO CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.749
HALLELUJAH.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.501
WHAT'S EVERYBODY

06:14.791 --> 06:16.501
DOING FOR THANKSGIVING?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.670
I CAN'T EVEN TALK

06:16.543 --> 06:18.670
ABOUT THANKSGIVING.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.670
LOUISE?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.464
I'M HAVING DINNER

06:18.712 --> 06:21.464
WITH MY DAD.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.464
ISN'T HE STILL IN JAIL?

06:21.506 --> 06:25.010
YES, BUT HIS COMPANY DONATED

06:21.506 --> 06:25.010
SOME TREADMILLS FOR THE INMATES,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.095
SO HE SWUNG A SPECIAL

06:25.052 --> 06:27.095
TRAILER FOR DINNER

06:27.137 --> 06:31.183
THAT THEY'LL SET UP

06:27.137 --> 06:31.183
FOR US IN THE PARKING LOT.

06:27.137 --> 06:31.183
WE HAVE IT FOR TWO HOURS.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.769
THEN ONE OF THE MANSON GIRLS

06:31.225 --> 06:34.769
GETS IT.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.769
YOU'RE LUCKY IT'S IN THAT ORDER.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.064
MY THANKSGIVING IS TURNING INTO

06:34.811 --> 06:37.064
A WES CRAVEN MOVIE.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.607
HOW SO?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.607
I CALLED SHELTERS TO

06:37.105 --> 06:39.607
VOLUNTEER TO SERVE FOOD.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.400
IT'S THANKSGIVING.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.400
YOU'D THINK THEY'D HAVE NEEDS.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.945
NOPE. EVERY STUPID SOUP KITCHEN

06:41.442 --> 06:43.945
IN TOWN TURNED ME DOWN

06:43.987 --> 06:45.572
BECAUSE THEY HAVE

06:43.987 --> 06:45.572
ENOUGH VOLUNTEERS.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.572
BUMMER.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.367
I'M ON A COUPLE WAITING LISTS,

06:45.613 --> 06:48.367
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.160
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

06:48.407 --> 06:50.160
TOO MANY VOLUNTEERS.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.871
WHO ARE ALL THESE JACKASSES

06:50.202 --> 06:52.871
WHO VOLUNTEERED ANYWAY?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.664
THEY CAN'T ALL BE STUDENTS

06:52.913 --> 06:54.664
LIKE ME.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.958
THEY'RE NOT ALL PUTTING IT ON

06:54.706 --> 06:56.958
A COLLEGE APPLICATION.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.753
I GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.753
THESE PEOPLE DON'T GET ANYTHING.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.171
TALK ABOUT SELFISH.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.171
SORE SUBJECT.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.797
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, MADELINE?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.883
I'VE GOT MORE COLLEGE

07:02.839 --> 07:04.883
APPLICATIONS TO FILL OUT --

07:04.925 --> 07:06.467
BACKUPS, SAFETY SCHOOLS.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.762
I'VE GOT SOME OF THAT, TOO.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.762
I'M SO BEHIND.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.556
I TOLD YOU TO HAVE

07:08.803 --> 07:11.556
THOSE DONE BY NOW.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.556
SORRY, MOM.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.850
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING SORRY.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.850
IT'S ABOUT BEING PREPARED.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.228
I GOT HARVARD AND MY BACKUPS

07:13.892 --> 07:16.228
IN WEEKS AGO.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.272
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS MAKING ME

07:16.270 --> 07:18.272
MORE NERVOUS.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.607
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS MONDAY.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.607
SAME HERE.

07:20.648 --> 07:24.194
YEAH, SEE YOU GUYS MONDAY.

07:20.648 --> 07:24.194
HARVARD IS GOING TO BE EXPECTING

07:20.648 --> 07:24.194
THANKSGIVING SHELTER WORK.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.572
THEY'LL KNOW I CALLED TOO LATE

07:24.236 --> 07:27.572
AND WILL TOTALLY IMPUGN

07:24.236 --> 07:27.572
MY ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.367
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW I

07:27.614 --> 07:30.367
ULTIMATELY DO ALL THESE THINGS

07:30.409 --> 07:32.452
FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND,

07:30.409 --> 07:32.452
RIGHT?

07:30.409 --> 07:32.452
OH, YEAH.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.996
SOMETIMES I DON'T THINK

07:32.493 --> 07:34.996
I COME OFF THAT WAY.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.996
NO.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.206
[PHONE RINGING]

07:36.248 --> 07:37.791
HELLO?

07:37.832 --> 07:40.043
YES, THANKS FOR RETURNING

07:37.832 --> 07:40.043
MY CALL.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.297
NOTHING? BUT -- WAIT.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.297
JUST STICK ME AT ANY POT.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.633
I'M SMALL. YOU WON'T KNOW

07:43.338 --> 07:46.633
I'M THERE. I'LL EVEN

07:43.338 --> 07:46.633
BRING MY OWN LADLE.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.676
OH, NOW, COME ON.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.676
WORK WITH ME HERE.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.637
I'VE GOT A SLOTTED SPOON.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.806
WELL, WHAT ABOUT COFFEE

07:50.678 --> 07:52.806
OR CONDIMENTS?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.724
YOU GOT CONDIMENTS COVERED?

07:54.766 --> 07:57.685
I'M SORRY.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.685
CAN I SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.397
<i>MY</i> ATTITUDE?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.397
WHAT ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE?

08:00.439 --> 08:03.108
I'M TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.108
IT'S THANKSGIVING.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.277
SO SHE COLDCOCKED

08:03.150 --> 08:05.277
YOU, HUH?

08:05.319 --> 08:08.529
SHE BIT ME -- INCAPACITATED

08:05.319 --> 08:08.529
ME WITH HER POISON

08:05.319 --> 08:08.529
AND DEVOURED ME WHOLE.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.617
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GO

08:08.571 --> 08:12.617
TO FOUR THANKSGIVING DINNERS?

08:08.571 --> 08:12.617
IT'S NOT FOUR, IS IT?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.911
LANE'S HOUSE, SOOKIE'S, AND WE

08:12.659 --> 08:14.911
ALWAYS STOP BY LUKE'S --

08:14.953 --> 08:16.955
THAT'S THREE, AND GRANDMA

08:14.953 --> 08:16.955
AND GRANDPA IS FOUR.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.748
WE'RE MAD, EDIE.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.748
WE'RE US, EDIE.

08:18.790 --> 08:22.085
WE'VE TO GO TO MY PARENTS'

08:18.790 --> 08:22.085
OR BE BROUGHT UP ON WAR CRIMES.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.379
LANE'S IS ALWAYS SUPEREARLY SO

08:22.127 --> 08:24.379
THAT'S EASY TO CATCH.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.006
SOOKIE'S IS MIDAFTERNOON.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.006
LUKE'S THE TOUGHIE.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.549
I GUESS THAT'S THE ONE

08:26.047 --> 08:28.549
WE'LL HAVE TO SKIP.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.549
BUMMER.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.636
I KNOW, BUT HE WON'T

08:28.591 --> 08:31.636
CARE. HOLIDAYS ARE

08:28.591 --> 08:31.636
NOTHING TO HIM ANYWAY.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.763
HEY, KIRK, DISCOVER

08:31.678 --> 08:33.763
A NEW FREAKY FETISH?

08:33.805 --> 08:35.640
WHAT?

08:33.805 --> 08:35.640
NOTHING.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.640
DID YOU BUY A CAT?

08:35.682 --> 08:38.435
YEP. I'M VERY EXCITED.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.435
YOU SEEM IT. SO

08:35.682 --> 08:38.435
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

08:38.477 --> 08:41.771
I'M ASSUMING THERE'S NOTHING

08:38.477 --> 08:41.771
LEFT IN THE STORE.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.771
THERE'RE NUMBER OF THINGS LEFT.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.858
NO, I MEANT YOU SEEM TO BE

08:41.813 --> 08:44.858
BUYING A LOT OF STUFF.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.734
OH, SORRY.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.734
MY EXCITEMENT MUST BE CLOUDING

08:46.776 --> 08:49.570
MY ABILITY TO JUDGE COMEDIC

08:46.776 --> 08:49.570
HYPERBOLE.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.570
WHERE'D YOU GET THE CAT?

08:49.612 --> 08:53.158
A LADY HAD A FEW AT

08:49.612 --> 08:53.158
THE GROCERY STORE, AND

08:49.612 --> 08:53.158
KIRK LIKED ME INSTANTLY.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.409
KIRK?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.409
YES.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.411
THE CAT'S

08:54.451 --> 08:56.411
NAME IS KIRK?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.411
YEP.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.871
WEIRD COINCIDENCE OR...

08:57.912 --> 08:59.956
I NAMED HIM KIRK.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.956
ISN'T THAT CONFUSING?

08:59.998 --> 09:02.417
NOT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.044
NO, IT'S STILL CONFUSING.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.587
I LIKE THE NAME, AND WHENEVER

09:04.085 --> 09:06.587
I CALL KIRK'S NAME,

09:06.629 --> 09:08.882
I OBVIOUSLY WON'T BE

09:06.629 --> 09:08.882
CALLING MYSELF.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.882
TRUE.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.676
ALTHOUGH WHEN MY MOM CALLS FOR

09:08.923 --> 09:11.676
KIRK, THAT MAY BE CONFUSING.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.013
MAYBE I CAN GET HER TO SAY

09:11.718 --> 09:15.013
CAT KIRK WHEN SHE'S CALLING KIRK

09:15.055 --> 09:18.099
AND HUMAN KIRK WHEN

09:15.055 --> 09:18.099
SHE'S CALLING ME.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.099
THAT WOULD KEEP IT STRAIGHT.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.436
I'M GLAD I RAN INTO YOU.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.436
SEE YA.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.436
SEE YA, HUMAN KIRK.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.523
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CAT PERSON.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.523
HE'S JUST NEVER HAD A CAT.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.400
HMM.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.110
[BELL RINGING]

09:29.152 --> 09:30.153
HEY. ANYWHERE?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.238
ANYWHERE.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.697
HMM...DO YOU MIND MOVING?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.242
I HATE WHEN YOU DO THAT.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.242

09:35.283 --> 09:36.451
AN<i> EMPTY</i> TABLE.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.501
THE EVERY-WEDNESDAY CHERRY PIE.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.501
SUCH SERVICE.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.294
IT'S SUCH A FOOD RUT

09:44.543 --> 09:46.294
WE'RE IN.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.629
I GOT TO GET BACK

09:46.336 --> 09:48.629
TO STUFFING MY TURKEY.

09:48.671 --> 09:52.217
DO YOU HAVE TIME TO DO THAT AND

09:48.671 --> 09:52.217
PREP YOUR THANKSGIVING FOOD?

09:48.671 --> 09:52.217
STOP IT.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.845
IT'S A TEDIOUS JOB.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.845
WHAT IF WE TOLD YOU

09:52.259 --> 09:55.845
YOU COULD STUFF ONE LESS?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.390
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.390
WE GOT SHANGHAIED BY MY MOTHER.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.726

09:58.432 --> 10:01.726

10:01.768 --> 10:03.520
WE CAN'T MAKE IT TOMORROW.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.606
OH, OKAY. FINE.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.606
IT WAS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.109
THAT'S FINE. WHATEVER.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.109
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

YEAH.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.404

10:15.115 --> 10:16.741

10:16.783 --> 10:19.035

10:19.077 --> 10:21.079
THAN WE KNOW.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.230
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.230
I ALREADY STOPPED

10:44.269 --> 10:47.230
PREPPING THE LAST TURKEY.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.524
WELL, START PREPPING IT AGAIN

10:47.272 --> 10:49.524
'CAUSE WE ARE COMING.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.402
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL

10:49.566 --> 10:52.402
LIKE YOU HAVE TO COME.

10:52.444 --> 10:56.156
THIS IS TIRING.

10:52.444 --> 10:56.156
I CAN KNEEL BEHIND HIM,

10:52.444 --> 10:56.156
AND YOU CAN PUSH HIM OVER.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.991
IT WON'T BE A HASSLE?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.991
IT WON'T.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.285
WE'RE COMING.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.285
NOW GO AWAY AND LET US EAT.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.829
SHOO, SHOO!

11:02.870 --> 11:04.289
THAT WAS VERY NICE.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.500
WELL, I HATE

11:04.331 --> 11:06.500
DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.959
OKAY, NOW,

11:06.541 --> 11:07.959
PRACTICAL QUESTION --

11:08.001 --> 11:10.253
HOW ARE WE GOING TO EAT FOUR

11:08.001 --> 11:10.253
THANKSGIVING DINNERS?

11:10.295 --> 11:14.090
HOW? RORY, WHAT ARE WE IF NOT

11:10.295 --> 11:14.090
WORLD-CHAMPION EATERS?

11:14.132 --> 11:16.092
IT'S TOO MUCH FOOD.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.092
IT'S NOT.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.386
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE TRAINED

11:16.134 --> 11:18.386
FOR OUR WHOLE LIVES.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.430
THIS IS OUR FINEST HOUR.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.430
OR FINAL HOUR.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.224
NO, NO. GET INSPIRED AND

11:20.472 --> 11:23.224
TOMORROW I GUARANTEE YOU,

11:23.266 --> 11:25.268
WE WILL BE STANDING ON

11:23.266 --> 11:25.268
THE OLYMPIC PLATFORM

11:25.310 --> 11:27.270
RECEIVING OUR GOLD

11:25.310 --> 11:27.270
MEDALS FOR EATING.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.771
WE'RE NOT

11:27.312 --> 11:28.771
MICHELLE KWAN-ING THIS.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.607
OKAY, OKAY.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.607
FOUR DINNERS.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.816
WE'LL SKIP THE ROLLS.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.318
THAT'LL HELP.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.654
WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

11:33.360 --> 11:35.654
NOT EATING MUCH NOW

11:35.694 --> 11:37.489
IN PREPARATION FOR OUR

11:35.694 --> 11:37.489
FINEST HOUR.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.409
A LITTLE FASTING SO WE CAN

11:37.531 --> 11:41.409
ENJOY MORE TOMORROW, HMM?

11:41.451 --> 11:42.661
UNNECESSARY.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.162
YEAH.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.459
WHAT'S ON THE LIST?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.459
FLOWERS FOR EVERYONE

11:48.208 --> 11:49.459
WE'RE VISITING

11:49.501 --> 11:50.709
AND CRANBERRY SAUCE FOR THE

11:49.501 --> 11:50.709
KIMS.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.546
TUMS?

11:50.751 --> 11:52.546
YOU MEAN AMATEUR PILLS?

11:52.587 --> 11:54.881
JUST IN CASE.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.881
OKAY, TUMS.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.133
I'LL DO THE FLOWERS.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.133
I'LL DO DOOSE'S.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.593
THANK YOU.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.557
HEY, THERE.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.557
HEY.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.851
WAIT, STOP.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.851
WHAT?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.895
STOP.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.895
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:08.936 --> 12:11.105
COME ON.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.105
RORY.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.276
WHAT WAS THAT?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.276
A KISS.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.278
WHAT'S WITH THE RELOCATION

12:15.318 --> 12:17.278
BEFORE THE KISS?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.614
IT'S TOO EARLY.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.614
TOO EARLY FOR WHAT?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.032
FOR KISSING LIKE THAT.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.950
WHAT'S THE RULE --

12:21.074 --> 12:22.950
NO KISSING BEFORE NOON?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.203
NO, IT'S TOO EARLY

12:22.992 --> 12:25.203
TO DO THIS HERE.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.538
WHERE? IN THE STREET?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.122
THE STREET

12:26.580 --> 12:28.122
WITH PEOPLE WATCHING.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.207
WHAT PEOPLE?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.291
IN FRONT OF DOOSE'S.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.834
AH. DOOSE'S.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.379
WE SHOULDN'T FLAUNT IT.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.379
BUT I WANT TO FLAUNT IT.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.881
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.881
HE'S A BIG BOY, RORY.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.217
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME

12:36.923 --> 12:39.217
A COUPLE'S BROKEN UP.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.094
IT IS FOR US.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.094
THIS IS INSANE.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.221
PLEASE, LET'S NOT

12:41.135 --> 12:43.221
FLAUNT IT. PLEASE?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.016
FOR HOW LONG?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.016
UNTIL IT'S COMFORTABLE.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.560
BEFORE WE'RE ON

12:47.058 --> 12:48.560
SOCIAL SECURITY?

12:48.602 --> 12:51.354
I PROMISE.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.354
WE CAN KISS SECRETLY.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.189
OR WE COULD WEAR "THREE

12:51.396 --> 12:53.189
STOOGES" MASKS.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.610
THAT WAY NO ONE WILL

12:53.231 --> 12:56.610
KNOW WHO WE ARE.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.610
I CAN BE CURLY.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.445
I'LL BE MOE.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.445
PROBABLY TOO SILLY.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.239
THIS WILL GET BETTER OVER TIME.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.239
I PROMISE.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.491
BUT UNTIL THEN,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.491
LET'S JUST PLAY IT COOL.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.326
HEY, I'M FRANK

13:03.533 --> 13:05.326
AT THE SANDS.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.953
THAT'S COOL.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.337
OH. HEY, KIRK.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.337
DOING YOUR HOLIDAY SHOPPING?

13:16.379 --> 13:18.465
WELL, SHOPPING, YES,

13:16.379 --> 13:18.465
AND IT IS A HOLIDAY,

13:18.506 --> 13:22.343
BUT MY SHOPPING ISN'T HOLIDAY

13:18.506 --> 13:22.343
RELATED, SO TECHNICALLY, NO.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.220
OH, WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

13:24.262 --> 13:25.764
OH, NOTHING --

13:24.262 --> 13:25.764
JUST A LITTLE SCRATCH.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.599
LOOKS LIKE A BIG SCRATCH.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.517
WOW! BACTINE, NEOSPORIN,

13:27.641 --> 13:29.517
MERCUROCHROME --

13:29.559 --> 13:31.436
WHAT'S WITH ALL

13:29.559 --> 13:31.436
THE PHARMACOLOGICALS?

13:31.478 --> 13:34.522
KIRK AND I ARE GOING THROUGH

13:31.478 --> 13:34.522
A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD,

13:31.478 --> 13:34.522
THAT'S ALL.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.065
CAT KIRK?

13:34.564 --> 13:36.065
IT'S NO BIGGIE,

13:36.107 --> 13:39.193
AND THIS LOOKS...A LOT

13:36.107 --> 13:39.193
WORSE THAN IT IS.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.654
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.697
HOW'D IT HAPPEN?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.697
YOU WERE PLAYING OR SOMETHING?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.449
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY

13:42.739 --> 13:44.449
PLAYED YET.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.535
HAPPENED WHEN I WALKED INTO THE

13:44.491 --> 13:47.535
ROOM WITHOUT ANNOUNCING MYSELF.

13:47.577 --> 13:51.872
EXCUSE ME?

13:47.577 --> 13:51.872
KIRK LIKES MY PRESENCE ANNOUNCED

13:47.577 --> 13:51.872
BEFORE I ENTER ANY ROOM HE'S IN.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.625
YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE

13:51.914 --> 13:53.625
YOURSELF?

13:53.667 --> 13:57.086
A QUICK, "OKAY IF I COME

13:53.667 --> 13:57.086
IN?" FROM THE ADJACENT ROOM.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.880
OTHERWISE HE GETS

13:57.128 --> 13:59.880
A LITTLE TESTY.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.880
HENCE THE SCRATCH.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.426
JUST A SMALL LACERATION --

13:59.922 --> 14:03.426
AGAIN, NO BIGGIE.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.303
[ GASPS ]

14:03.468 --> 14:05.303
KIRK, HE GOT YOUR NECK.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.845
THAT WAS ANOTHER MISTAKE

14:05.345 --> 14:06.845
OF MINE.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.390
I PUT HIS FOOD BOWL DOWN

14:06.887 --> 14:09.390
IN FRONT OF HIM.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.267
HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT --

14:09.432 --> 14:11.267
OR SHE DOESN'T.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.395
SHE? I THOUGHT KIRK

14:11.309 --> 14:14.395
WAS A BOY.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.395
THAT WAS JUST A GUESS.

14:14.437 --> 14:18.733
HE ACTUALLY HASN'T EXPOSED HIS

14:14.437 --> 14:18.733
UNDERSIDE TO ME YET -- OR HERS.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.695
WELL, HERE'S HOPING YOUR CAT

14:18.775 --> 14:21.695
EXPOSES ITSELF TO YOU SOON.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.238
FROM YOUR MOUTH

14:21.736 --> 14:24.238
TO GOD'S EARS. SEE YA.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.573
SEE YA.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.163
HI, THERE.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.163
HI.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.956
SO YOU PULLED

14:32.205 --> 14:33.956
THE THANKSGIVING SHIFT, HUH?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.250
YEAH, I GET TIME AND A HALF.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.250
GOOD, GOOD.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.421
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.421
SAME HERE. UM, SO,

14:36.292 --> 14:40.421
I GOT TO WORK.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.173
RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.173
TAYLOR'S A DICTATOR.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.300
YEAH.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.427
DEAN, WAIT.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.638
UM...

14:48.680 --> 14:52.266
LOOK, WE LIVE IN A TEENY,

14:48.680 --> 14:52.266
TINY, LITTLE HAMLET HERE.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.060
I MEAN,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.060
STICK IT IN AN ENVELOPE,

14:54.101 --> 14:56.979
AND WE COULD MAIL THE WHOLE

14:54.101 --> 14:56.979
TOWN FOR A BUCK, 40.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.232
MAKES AVOIDING PEOPLE TOUGH

14:57.021 --> 14:59.232
AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.274
I KNOW.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.776
I HATE HIDING FROM PEOPLE,

15:01.818 --> 15:04.070
ESPECIALLY WHEN I DON'T WANT

15:01.818 --> 15:04.070
TO HIDE FROM THEM.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.614
YOU WERE A PAL.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.614
YOU WERE SO GOOD TO RORY.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.409
YOU WERE THE BEST

15:06.656 --> 15:09.409
FIRST BOYFRIEND

15:06.656 --> 15:09.409
A MOTHER COULD HOPE FOR.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.952
THANKS.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.952
IT'S OKAY TO KEEP

15:09.450 --> 15:11.952
AVOIDING ME IF YOU WANT.

15:11.994 --> 15:16.290
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

15:11.994 --> 15:16.290
THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO, OKAY?

15:16.332 --> 15:19.836
JUST BECAUSE YOU AND RORY BROKE

15:16.332 --> 15:19.836
UP DOESN'T MEAN WE DID.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.714
GOOD.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.714
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.675
WELL, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.594
YEAH, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.307
WHEW!

15:36.686 --> 15:39.439
OH, PRETTY.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.439
THEY HAD A GOOD SELECTION

15:36.686 --> 15:39.439
TODAY. YOU GET EVERYTHING?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.149
YOU GET EVERYTHING?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.149
AND THEN SOME. LOOK.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.568
CHOCOLATE TURKEYS!

15:42.191 --> 15:43.568
NICE!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.361
I THINK THEY'LL ADD

15:43.610 --> 15:45.361
A FESTIVE AIR.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.656
DEFINITELY.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.656
SO...WAS HE IN THERE?

15:48.698 --> 15:50.366
YEAH, HE WAS.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.535
GOOD, GOOD.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.535
I HOPE HE'S GOOD.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.872
DID HE SEEM GOOD?

15:52.577 --> 15:55.872
HE SEEMED GOOD. HE'S

15:52.577 --> 15:55.872
GETTING TIME AND A HALF.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.249
GOOD, GOOD. SO

15:55.914 --> 15:58.249
LET'S GO EAT.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.333
AND EAT AND EAT.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.628
AND EAT AND EAT AND EAT.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.628
AND EAT.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.003
AND EAT SOME MORE.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.507
AH, THE GILMORES.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.507
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.676
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.676
COME IN.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.720
In a good mood this year.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.720
Downright chipper.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.264
SO, UM, MRS. KIM,

16:10.762 --> 16:13.264
WE BROUGHT GIFTS.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.933
FLOWERS...

16:14.974 --> 16:17.184
AND CRANBERRY SAUCE -- OUR

16:14.974 --> 16:17.184
LITTLE THANKSGIVING TRADITION.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.479
CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.479
THAT'S WHAT WE SAY.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.064
PLUS, A CHOCOLATE TURKEY.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.064
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THIS?

16:22.106 --> 16:25.109
LET KIDS SHARE IT.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.109
THEN SEND A BLANK CHECK

16:22.106 --> 16:25.109
TO THEIR DENTISTS?

16:25.151 --> 16:28.738
THEY COULD PLAY WITH IT.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.738
PLAY WITH CHOCOLATE? IT'S

16:25.151 --> 16:28.738
MISSING IT'S HEAD.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.073
OOH, THAT ONE'S OURS.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.215
IT'S A HIM?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.215
I CAUGHT A PEEK.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.927
I ROLLED THIS LITTLE BALL OF

22:21.257 --> 22:24.927
YARN OVER ALL NICE AND GENTLE.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.720
HE TRIED TO GARROTE ME

22:24.969 --> 22:26.720
WITH IT.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.388
OH, MY GOD!

22:26.762 --> 22:28.388
VERY UNCOOL.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.225
JUST GRABBED TWO ENDS

22:28.430 --> 22:31.225
WITH HIS PAWS AND CAME AT ME.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.726
HE DOESN'T HAVE

22:31.267 --> 22:32.726
OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.728
HE'S BEYOND THEM.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.728
HE'S SMART.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.814
HE KNOWS THINGS -- SOMETIMES

22:34.770 --> 22:36.814
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.942
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.942
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

22:36.856 --> 22:39.942
THE WORST.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.485
WHEN THE ATTACKS GOT

22:39.984 --> 22:41.485
PARTICULARLY BRUTAL,

22:41.527 --> 22:43.529
I HAD NO CHOICE

22:41.527 --> 22:43.529
BUT TO STRIP NAKED

22:43.570 --> 22:45.198
AND HIDE UNDERWATER

22:43.570 --> 22:45.198
IN THE BATHTUB.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.241
I READ THAT CATS ARE AFRAID

22:45.239 --> 22:47.241
OF WATER.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.535
THEY ARE!

22:47.283 --> 22:49.535
KIRK ISN'T.

22:49.576 --> 22:53.789
HE SEEMED TO DERIVE GREATER

22:49.576 --> 22:53.789
POWER FROM THE WATER.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.000
THAT'S WHEN THE BULK OF

22:53.831 --> 22:56.000
THE SCRATCHING HAPPENED.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.170
WELL, THEN I THINK IT'S GOOD

22:56.042 --> 22:59.170
YOU'RE GIVING KIRK SPACE NOW.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.088
JUST RELAX

22:59.212 --> 23:01.088
AND ENJOY YOUR FOOD.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.548
I CAN'T TASTE MY FOOD.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.175
WELL,

23:02.589 --> 23:04.175
THEN JUST TRY TO RELAX.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.383
THANKS.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.222
HEY.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.556
HEY.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.266
HI.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.934
HI.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.934
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.353
SO,

23:13.976 --> 23:15.353
ARE YOU JOINING US?

23:15.393 --> 23:17.104
UH, SURE,

23:15.393 --> 23:17.104
IF THAT'S OKAY.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.648
YEAH, SIT, SIT.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.733
GOD,

23:19.690 --> 23:20.733
I'M STARVED.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.859
YOU COULD HAVE EATEN.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.944
YOU KEPT TELLING ME

23:21.901 --> 23:23.944
NOT TO EAT.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.738
YOU SAID WE WERE

23:23.986 --> 23:25.738
WAITING FOR THEM.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.573
YOU DIDN'T HAVE

23:25.779 --> 23:27.573
TO WAIT FOR US.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.408
I WASN'T WAITING FOR YOU.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.408
IT JUST WORKED OUT THIS WAY.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.745
RIGHT.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.745
LOOKS GREAT.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.788
WHOA, WHOA. SHOULDN'T WE

23:32.786 --> 23:34.788
GIVE THANKS FIRST?

23:34.830 --> 23:36.665
THANKS FOR WHAT?

23:36.707 --> 23:39.210
THAT WE'RE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS

23:36.707 --> 23:39.210
WHO GOT THEIR LAND STOLEN

23:39.252 --> 23:41.879
IN EXCHANGE FOR

23:39.252 --> 23:41.879
SMALLPOX-INFESTED BLANKETS.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.464
AMEN.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.464
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS

23:41.921 --> 23:44.464
IN YOUR DAY?

23:44.506 --> 23:46.884
WE HIT THE KIMS',

23:44.506 --> 23:46.884
WE HIT SOOKIE'S,

23:46.926 --> 23:49.427
AND WE GO TO THE GRANDPARENTS

23:46.926 --> 23:49.427
FROM HERE.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.427
FULL DAY.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.972
YOU CAN SKIP EATING THIS ONE

23:49.469 --> 23:51.972
IF YOU WANT.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.267
JUST HAVE COKES OR SOMETHING.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.267
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.603
NO WAY.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.603
YOU'RE THE MAIN EVENT TODAY.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.146
WHAT'S GOOD ARE THE YAMS.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.773
GOT SOME MORE

23:59.188 --> 24:00.773
MARSHMALLOWS?

24:00.814 --> 24:02.066
I CAN GRAB SOME.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.651
REFILL SOME COFFEES.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.948
SO, NO OFFENSE,

24:06.737 --> 24:08.948
BUT LAME-O KISS.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.324
WHAT?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.118
LIKE A COUPLE CHICKENS

24:10.366 --> 24:12.118
PECKING EACH OTHER.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.912
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.912
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.705
I DON'T NEED A REVIEW.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.705
SORRY.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.749
I'M JUST NOT GOOD WITH

24:16.747 --> 24:18.749
THE PUBLIC DISPLAYS.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.542
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM

24:18.791 --> 24:20.542
WITH DEAN.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.878
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE

24:20.584 --> 24:22.878
EVERYBODY'S WATCHING ME.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.671
PEOPLE ARE NOT WATCHING.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.671
YOU WERE WATCHING.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.174
IT'S BIOLOGICALLY PREDETERMINED

24:24.713 --> 24:27.174
THAT I WATCH YOU.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.052
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS

24:27.216 --> 24:30.052
SECOND-BOYFRIEND THING

24:27.216 --> 24:30.052
IS SUPPOSED TO GO.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.096
HE'S YOUR FIRST

24:30.094 --> 24:32.096
SECOND BOYFRIEND. GIVE IT TIME.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.390
THE WHOLE TOWN GOT USED TO ME

24:32.138 --> 24:34.390
WITH DEAN.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.892
IT'LL GET EASIER. YOU'RE GONNA

24:34.432 --> 24:36.892
HAVE HUNDREDS OF MEN.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.560
GEE, THANKS.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.604
MAYBE NOT HUNDREDS,

24:38.602 --> 24:40.604
BUT A COUPLE -- 3 -- MORE.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.523
IT'LL GET EASIER. THEY'LL

24:40.646 --> 24:43.523
ADJUST TO SEEING YOU WITH JESS.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.525
THEN THERE'S DEAN.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.525
WHAT DO I DO?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.945
WELL, YOU KNOW,

24:45.567 --> 24:47.945
HE'LL BE MOVING ON, TOO.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.571
OH. RIGHT.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.073
OF COURSE HE WILL.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.073
YEAH.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.867
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.867
TIME TO WALK SOME OF THIS OFF.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.787
WE'D HAVE TO WALK TO CHINA.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.787
WHICH WAY'S CHINA?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.414

24:56.829 --> 24:58.414
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.667

24:58.456 --> 25:01.667
HALF-ASSED KISS YOU TWO HAD.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.295

25:01.708 --> 25:04.295

25:07.589 --> 25:09.591
THE WHOLE TOWN IS WATCHING.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.473
YOU READY FOR THIS?

25:13.679 --> 25:15.473
OF COURSE.

25:15.513 --> 25:18.516
EVEN WITH THE COLD WAR?

25:15.513 --> 25:18.516
I CAN MANAGE.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.811
IT'S BEEN A BIT COLDER

25:18.558 --> 25:20.811
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.896
OH, NO, I'M FINE.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.896
BECAUSE IN TWO HOURS --

25:22.938 --> 25:26.025
I DO PLAN ON EXTRICATING US FROM

25:26.066 --> 25:29.111
AND I WON'T HAVE TO SEE THEM

25:29.153 --> 25:31.529
AGAIN UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.529
START YOUR STOPWATCH.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.866

25:42.540 --> 25:44.960
I FOUND HIM AT NORDSTROM'S.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.960
WAS HE ON SALE?

25:45.002 --> 25:47.421
I THOUGHT MUSIC WOULD ADD

25:45.002 --> 25:47.421
A NICE TOUCH.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.964
HE KNOWS EVERY SONG

25:47.463 --> 25:48.964

ASKING MY FRIEND TO GO TO BED
