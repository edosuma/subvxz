02:25.729 --> 02:27.937
Honey, have you seen my
tractor key?

02:28.065 --> 02:30.398
I have a feeling that I
someone wants to play a trick.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.444
Face it, mister yet. You have breakfast
now first and take your pills.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.860
Then you forget the old tractor,
because you will not have enough energy

02:37.991 --> 02:39.357
to stay awake until noon.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.735

sponsored by Chandler pharmaceuticals.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.909
We have already talked about it, right?
We have talked about this disease,

04:13.044 --> 04:15.127
this virus, this crisis,
in which we find ourselves.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.995
And indeed caused by the drugs,

04:17.132 --> 04:19.249
marketed by Chandler pharmaceuticals
.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.464
These alleged drugs were handed out to you,

In the land of plenty! You should be
vigilant, you should reflect on themselves

04:34.608 --> 04:37.191
And take care of themselves.
Take these pills out the window.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.066
Throw them which face
back! I know that you fear. Value  A dollar only five cents

04:41.198 --> 04:44.191
. You want to hide,

04:44.326 --> 04:48.787
stay and watch TV there. But I leave
Do not! I'll call to arms!

04:48.914 --> 04:51.998

They are human beings
grace of God!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.373
I'm sick of it and
should have it too full.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.046
The Chandler
pharmaceuticals come from

04:59.090 --> 05:02.504
and throw just as with our money in order to
because the government this company

05:02.636 --> 05:04.548
zuschÃ¼ttet and their shareholders with more money

05:04.679 --> 05:07.843
as a circus horse could skip
. For God's sake.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.676
Oh. I still rotating through completely.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.845
Jesus Christ! This party waitress
I'll throw out today yet.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.718
The leaving all the garbage from
last night are easy.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.055
Damn!

06:08.660 --> 06:11.903
Hey, pig's cheek.
I distribute your cerebellum around the bar

06:15.500 --> 06:18.163
Charlie! Jesus Christ, I thought
, you were one of those!

06:18.295 --> 06:20.753
Shit hurts.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.128
What the hell are you looking at my bar?
And how the hell did you get in?

06:24.217 --> 06:29.212
What do you mean "what I'm looking here
"? And how am I get in?

06:30.098 --> 06:33.341
I've had a few short
, Katie Ann,

06:33.435 --> 06:35.347
this dancer-security-Chick.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.640
I do not know, man.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.643
I just know that you have a fucking gun
think my face.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.941
So you're still in my bar
and no one has noticed it?

06:42.611 --> 06:45.228
Jesus Palomino, I have
find myself better people.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.277
By the way: Do you see like shit.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.703
I have to stop with the shit, man
. It gets worse by the day.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.200
In the ass you are anyway.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.286
Man...

07:00.670 --> 07:02.286
What does this now mean
again?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.631
You never get what the
row, Bro. Take a look...

07:05.717 --> 07:06.878
Do you want a drink of water?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.380
Yes.

07:08.511 --> 07:12.972
Look at me. I was caught with hard drugs
, was over in Angola

07:13.099 --> 07:17.639
and got clean. I knew that I must do
either end of it,

07:18.229 --> 07:20.186
go back to jail. Or die.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.732
That was a damn good incentive to keep
the woman, the child, the Bar

07:23.860 --> 07:27.274
and the other shit. You on the other hand
're full in the ass.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.906
Charlie, I do not say it like that, but
you're not the criminal type.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.616
The jail is certainly no
option. Besides, you're a musician.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.035
You'll certainly not rich if
you play in the bars of New Orleans.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.492
For this, they kiss you every day
ass.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.462
No offense, but
you're not too old for this,

07:45.548 --> 07:47.915
to any pussies hinterherzurennen
and sink in bars?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.965
Yes. I do not know, man.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.636
Hello?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.134
Yes.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.269
What for?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.480
16, can you hear me?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.228
Have understood, 56
We drive to the crime scene.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.818
So a shit like this here,
I have never seen before. Man!

08:08.238 --> 08:12.152
This makes no sense. These people have spent their whole lives here
.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.026
Give me a sip of you!

08:15.120 --> 08:16.201
I thought you had stopped?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.324
I did too. But with
so I can not help it.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.077
You should not start again
drinking.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.458
Man, now give me already a
sip. You guys are all beginners!

08:34.681 --> 08:39.176
God, there's so much blood. Have you ever seen
so much blood?

08:39.309 --> 08:40.767
I can not believe this.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.189
Something I've never seen.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.517
As if three alligators have
because raged inside.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.483
Alligators I've never seen something like
make.

09:02.208 --> 09:06.873
Hey, Bitch! You know that we have the pills
count there. Premises rather the garbage.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.502
The freedom to choose! The
freedom to speak! Freedom!

09:11.342 --> 09:13.379
Freedom is not for pharmaceuticals

09:13.470 --> 09:15.382
and certainly not for
Chandler pharmaceuticals.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.976
I know that it
is hard for you, Charlie.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.357
What the hell happened in there, Jim?

09:30.487 --> 09:35.778
We'll soon find out. This shit does not happen
in my community.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.744
I have a forensics team
requested, from Baton Rouge.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.863
I'll every sheriff from the surrounding communities
Request

09:42.957 --> 09:44.573
and start every available man on
.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.164
We'll get answers and find out
, what happened to your mom.

09:48.254 --> 09:54.876
This is not my mom I do not know
what it is, but it's not my mom

09:58.807 --> 10:00.423
Who would do this to your thing?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.510
All the people here in the area
loved my family.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.055
This shit makes no sense.

10:09.692 --> 10:15.154
Listen, Charlie. Our families have known each other
for many years.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.444
We find your dad.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.364
And we find the one who did this.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.245
I'm not going to sit around and wait on it
.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.536
The FDA will never allow the
drug.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.872
We would lose an ass
of coal.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.302
The patients showed more side effects in the past
trials.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.047
It would be hard put to cover up the
.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.472
Chandler pharmaceuticals distributed among the citizens of the information,

11:26.603 --> 11:28.435
that they help them get through the day.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.064
They help you through the night at
, the week or the month.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.858
They even help with the attachment!

11:39.574 --> 11:42.191
They should get you over the worst.
In all this it should help them.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.693
And now for the record:

11:44.120 --> 11:48.160
I'm not worried about a pissed-off
gulf coast DJ.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.450
And I said to Pierre,
that I wished I

11:50.585 --> 11:52.201
Russ Chandler outside
to run into.

11:52.295 --> 11:56.039
That would be a good opportunity to
the bully to miss.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.396
We are back in New Orleans ninth
district. In our region, the popular

13:36.482 --> 13:41.648
and controversial DJ Aldous Huxtable.
I wanted to ask you, and I hope

13:41.779 --> 13:43.111
that you give us an answer.

13:43.197 --> 13:48.363
They preach so emphatic about the
trigger for the events that occurred.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.124
I can tell them exactly,
what the triggers are, Connie.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.584
There are greed and avarice.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.797
You have to be a genius to figure it out.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.415
This is since time immemorial that.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.675
Obviously Chandler
pharmaceuticals is nothing more

14:08.806 --> 14:11.389
than a bargaining chip
our government. She let it be,

14:11.476 --> 14:15.060
That your
"posttraumatic anti-stress" - Drugs

14:15.146 --> 14:18.560
in recent months to distribute the
inhabitants. And now we see

14:18.649 --> 14:21.483
what these mind altering
pills are capable of.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.154
I tell them, you are...
- Okay, okay. Aldous.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.489
You are the wrecking ball
our society.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.233
As you can... How can you be so sure
,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.406
that there is a connection there with the drugs?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.403
Could not it rather a
be living in the water parasite,

14:33.456 --> 14:34.822
from the time after Katrina?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.323
The facts are still very clear.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.701
In recent months, the competent authority Drugs

14:38.836 --> 14:41.624
can do nothing about these experiments in experience
,

14:41.756 --> 14:43.497
which were incidentally commissioned by
...

14:54.477 --> 14:57.845
My son returned with acute
PTSD from Iraq.

14:57.980 --> 14:58.936
God bless him.

14:59.315 --> 15:05.061
He was involved in the tests with these drugs.
And now? What should I do now?

15:05.363 --> 15:08.276
You should get him out from these tests!
He ââis not a participant of the test,

15:08.366 --> 15:11.825
it is the test! My goodness, this
pharmaceutical companies

15:11.911 --> 15:14.619
Chandler pharmaceuticals, and the
competent governmental authority

15:14.705 --> 15:19.325
they provide your son with drugs that have
camouflaged as anti-depressants.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.583
But oh, it's the devil,
it's voodoo. It is a virus!

15:22.713 --> 15:25.626
And you guys are crazy! You take it with
right and left, no matter

15:25.800 --> 15:28.338
as it just comes and swallows it like a candy
! What's wrong with you?

15:28.928 --> 15:34.265
Wow. Just look at us. Our
fathers would be very proud.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.763
Why do you need
Black Rain as a bodyguard?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.760
We need Black Rain
not as a bodyguard.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.602
I want you to be eliminating this
creatures for me.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.815
So you need me to dispose of your garbage
?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.188
This will not be cheap, Rush.

15:50.283 --> 15:55.324
The disposal of garbage is your
task. To pay you for it, is mine.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.455
There are about four or five thousand of these persons
.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.621
Yes, more or less.

16:01.711 --> 16:06.456
It has it changed completely. I
wants you, you are removing for me.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.797
Here is someone I want to introduce them.
Dr. Soulis?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.179
Welcome Katie Ann.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.050
Beautiful. That was guys against girls?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.475
And what have you to do with it?

16:19.020 --> 16:23.936
Dr. Soulis is the Managing Director of
research and development here at Chandler.

16:24.066 --> 16:29.528
Yes, thank you. Listen. Let me tell you something about the
background of this drug.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.275
As I myself witnessed what
devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina

16:34.410 --> 16:38.745
had on the residents of New Orleans
, I saw a crystal clear chance

16:38.873 --> 16:43.993
for a more effective treatment of post-traumatic stress

16:44.086 --> 16:46.499
and anxiety-like behavioral disorders,

16:47.298 --> 16:49.631
under which seemed to suffer from the patients.

16:49.675 --> 16:55.091
I immediately started with the development of an innovative drug
,

16:55.181 --> 16:58.970
which should help to solve the stress

16:59.060 --> 17:02.428
and returns the poor people
their former life.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.226
I'm strongly assuming
that it was not your intention,

17:05.316 --> 17:07.729
To make the victim to mindless killers
, Dr. Soulis?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.104
Oh, quite the contrary.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.320
I think the doctor may
speak for themselves.

17:13.281 --> 17:20.325
Thank you. Yes, really. Quite the contrary
. You have to understand,

17:20.414 --> 17:23.498
there was an extreme craving for this drug.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.372
There was not much time
for further clinical testing.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.916
What we did not know was that, with the increasing burden

17:32.051 --> 17:38.093
, their blood changed during the treatments
of patients.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.258
So much so that it is a negative behavior pattern to

17:41.394 --> 17:44.137
resulted in some parts of your brain.

17:44.230 --> 17:48.645
I mean, ultimately, these are
patients, according to our experience,

17:49.277 --> 17:50.893
more or less brain dead.

17:52.029 --> 17:55.898
Let me summarize it for you in very simple terms
:

17:56.951 --> 17:59.238
It's not even so much
brain function exists,

17:59.370 --> 18:02.329
that these poor bastards to
could tie the laces.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.000
And what about the human
basic need to survive?

18:07.086 --> 18:12.172
I would not say that you are
human. The point is, you see,

18:13.968 --> 18:20.306
need these people, they require
and want fresh blood

18:20.391 --> 18:26.353
and do everything. Your instinct
wants it that way. Whatever happen!

18:37.700 --> 18:39.783
Wait here. They belong to me.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.455
The trigger is stiff.
Throw time on it a glance.

18:49.253 --> 18:53.463
I will just informed that
we have a surprise guest.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.255
A guest caller on the
line, it is Dr. Soulis.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.470
It is something like the father
of this drug. He is a scientist

19:00.556 --> 19:03.048
Has  and develops, because of the
post-traumatic-stress syndrome.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.393
And the result is violence and
corruption in our beautiful city.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.389
Dr. Soulis, we know your call
appreciate. Are you there, sir?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.974
Hello? Aldous...

19:12.109 --> 19:13.691
A very good evening, sir.

19:13.819 --> 19:18.610
Aldous, let me explain.
My project was the development of

19:18.741 --> 19:23.953
an innovative treatment.
Not only to live with PTSD,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.572
but to cure it under certain circumstances.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.541
What can you offer us? What
information we can get from it,

19:29.710 --> 19:31.667
to get out of this fatal
situation?

19:31.796 --> 19:34.960
I wanted to give them back your life.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.340
Okay. I have good news and bad news
.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.510
What you want to hear first?

19:41.639 --> 19:43.301
So, I always prefer
the good news.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.843
All right. Here
is the bad news.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.720
You scoundrel.

19:46.811 --> 19:51.306
There is absolutely nothing we could do for these poor people.

19:52.316 --> 19:56.356
If you are taking this medication,
it leads to massive brain damage.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.814
And it gets mixed with other illegal substances
...

19:59.907 --> 20:02.149
Croak shalt thou, that thou hast made me
so dependent.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.864
I have no idea what are you talking
there, man.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.994
... These act as an accelerator.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.495
Result, the conversion takes place almost rapidly.

20:13.587 --> 20:19.208
We unfortunately have no other
choice but to eliminate the victims.

20:21.429 --> 20:25.423
The good news is that we have
colleagues, at the University of Texas

20:25.474 --> 20:29.809
In the medical center. They say
that you could reverse the effect,

20:29.937 --> 20:35.433
all of you who have taken the drug within
the last 72 hours.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.144
You're right, these are really good news
, sir. This is fantastic.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.730
And how can we get to
this serum?

20:41.824 --> 20:45.443
On this, there is in Texas,
from the medical center?

20:45.536 --> 20:48.404
Well, as you probably know, the airport was closed
,

20:48.539 --> 20:50.701
I mean the Louis Armstrong Airport.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.123
In fact, this is true.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.289
Likewise, the entire airspace was New Orleans

20:55.421 --> 20:58.789
How  no-fly zone. I
do not know for what reasons,

20:58.883 --> 21:01.626
because you know as much as I
. Our government...

21:05.681 --> 21:09.015
... Denied the flight to get there.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.592
There you have it.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.892
What can you say to
? What can we do?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.937
Chandler pharmaceuticals keeps us on a short leash,

21:18.027 --> 21:19.859
long as we take this
anti-depressants.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.564
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
here speaks again Aldous Huxtable.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.817
It was previously rare that I'm speechless
,

21:26.911 --> 21:28.994
but today is
to a particular case.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.534
That's why I make myself
on the way to Austin

21:31.624 --> 21:33.786
to the serum to find
and herzubringen it.

21:34.418 --> 21:38.628
I can not just sit here and wait
. For all those

21:38.714 --> 21:43.254
which are in dire straits, is
Pierre, my assistant, here,

21:43.385 --> 21:46.469
answer your calls and passes the information
,

21:46.972 --> 21:49.180
if you are in trouble.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.851
It is time to put
the fight. The war...

22:11.664 --> 22:13.280
Aldous  that came in here for you.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.578
What is it?
- No idea, it was dropped.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.040
What do you mean dropped? By whom?

22:19.129 --> 22:21.246
I do not know. Military.
- Military?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.333
Yes, yes. Camouflage, any
badge, all that stuff.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.799
What is it?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.973
My God. He has told the truth.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.764
Is that what I think it?

22:41.527 --> 22:42.984
Pierre, I have to go now.

22:47.241 --> 22:52.361
Aldous Huxtable logs off.
God have mercy on us all.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.865
I do not know how I go there
and how long it will take.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.287
The way is long and
my time is short.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.799
Take that with.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.468
Pierre, I wish you could come with me
.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.051
Take care of yourself.
- Thank you. God bless you.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.329
Are you Aldous Huxtable?

23:40.461 --> 23:42.168
Yes, that's me. Do I know you, sir? Get into the car

23:49.094 --> 23:51.051
!
- You're welcome.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.350
I think I've peed me.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.464
You go to the door, Bro! Move your
ass, I'm just gambling, man!

24:35.557 --> 24:38.265
Fuck you, nigger. This is
your shit and your door.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.435
Pass on prefer, otherwise
are you there like that.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.894
What is going on?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.521
Ah, hi Sorry to bother you.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.066
Do you think we could get two grams
of your good stuff?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.359
From the good stuff?
- Yes.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.317
I interrupting my fucking game
because of two crappy bags?

24:55.452 --> 24:58.445
No, no. Sorry. Can we get a
Eight-Ball?

24:58.539 --> 24:59.655
That would be better!

24:59.790 --> 25:01.281
Yes, make two out of it. I'm still
money from my dad.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.460
Age, I hate this part of the city
. The guys chasing me afraid.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.582
We need a hiding place for it.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.254
If Mom and Dad find that
they'll kill us.

25:09.383 --> 25:10.794
200 Okay.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.631
I...

25:13.721 --> 25:17.010
If you only
touches my fucking game, I get the out. That was it.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.427
Hey, you draw to you with
us a pure if we...?

25:18.559 --> 25:20.050
That would be really...
- Fuck off!

25:37.369 --> 25:38.109
Yes?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.658
Rush? I want the exact numbers now.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.705
How much is
of the stuff really outstanding?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.704
And how many patients were
administered the drug?

26:03.020 --> 26:06.138
And even if I knew how many pills
we released...

26:06.607 --> 26:09.350
There are a lot out there
street dealers who peddle this shit.

26:09.735 --> 26:13.604
The  mix the stuff with all sorts.
Why are you asking me that?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.700
For what I pay you actually
? War it out myself.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.954
Rush! I know you know of the serum.

26:41.475 --> 26:44.218
I'm not paying you to make you worry about a fictitious serum
,

26:44.311 --> 26:47.395
the totally ruin my company would
. I'll pay you for it,

26:47.481 --> 26:50.224
that you flat do these creatures
and that calm returns

26:50.317 --> 26:52.229
before it spreads further.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.063
Do you hear me? Katie, do you hear me?

26:57.616 --> 26:58.481
Yes.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.580
Fuck!

27:25.435 --> 27:30.897
Wow. A really great automobile is
this. A muscle car from the period,

27:31.024 --> 27:32.390
when they were still made of iron.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.103
That has really cost money,
the vollzutanken times, am I right?

27:36.238 --> 27:38.195
Have you ever heard of hybrid
? I ask you something,

27:38.323 --> 27:42.442
you are wearing no economic,
on fiscal responsibility?

27:42.911 --> 27:46.530
This is yesterday's news. I do not want to talk shop
, but let's just say,

27:46.665 --> 27:49.157
the price of fuel and the ecosystem
not very near the top

27:49.209 --> 27:50.575
on my shitty
To-Do list.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.754
It wanted to have just said.
Have mercy on us. What's going on?

27:55.924 --> 27:59.793
It is hard to believe that these things
our friends and our neighbors.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.301
Thank you earlier
've saved my life.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.178
Yes. Do not mention it.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.564
Wow. Ha...

28:21.700 --> 28:23.032
Do you hear the guys about it?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.742
What? Are you a fan of Zydeco?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.783
Oh yes. My father thought that it
is important for us to understand,

28:27.915 --> 28:32.250
What our heritage is, and the
music has played a major role.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.245
When we moved sometime in the St. Bernard
church, he desperately wanted

28:35.339 --> 28:38.457
that we look at all these guys.
My grandfather thought he was crazy,

28:38.508 --> 28:42.001
but today I really appreciate it.
And you? How do you know the guys?

28:42.137 --> 28:44.299
I've played with the boys guitar.
- Really?

28:44.389 --> 28:47.302
The only white person in the band.
I was a little shit.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.472
Ah, you're not old enough to know
who is Clifton Chenier.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.685
He is no longer with us.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.146
Clear I know. Clifton died a
year after our first meeting.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.399
Jerry Reed would say I was
the swinging little guitar, ha

29:00.948 --> 29:05.033
I played with Rockin Dopsie, Beau Jocque
, Boozoo Chavez and the others.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.865
I do not think that's true,
but I am curious if it is true.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.870
Then you must be from Louisiana.
As yet sits the creme de la creme.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.041
Are you from Louisiana?

29:14.169 --> 29:17.378
I started with guitar and accordion playing
in the Louisiana music scene.

29:17.506 --> 29:25.425
Ha! Oh yes. Charlie. Mister Charlie
Thibideaux how he lives and breathes. That's you!

29:25.514 --> 29:29.554
Of course I know who you are. I
got you in "Tips" in the "One-eye Jack"

29:29.685 --> 29:31.642
seen  and in the other clubs.
Yes, of course.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.185
I know who you are. You are a local
legend, this is probably clear? Yes, you ..

29:36.316 --> 29:38.933
Why did not you
further made it to the top?

29:39.069 --> 29:41.356
I mean, you've had this
song, this... what was his name?

29:42.489 --> 29:46.733
Ah, Caricrow Girl, right? Caricrow,
that was it, yes. What happened?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.659
The song is here
never become a hit, right?

29:48.745 --> 29:51.283
No. That was a bigger success
in Europe, where he was the less.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.617
I And? I now take a break.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.418
A break?

29:58.547 --> 30:00.038
Want a sip?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.883
Yes. Yes.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.798
Caution, this is really good stuff.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.304
Is better than nothing.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.812
Holy shit!

30:20.485 --> 30:22.101
The scared me to death.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.415
Are you ready?

30:40.047 --> 30:40.958
Yes.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.959
Well, then release.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.095
Here is Rush Chandler.
Make it short.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.382
Hey, Rush. Go and fuck yourself!

30:54.227 --> 30:55.843
We're going to Texas.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.063
It starts.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.926
Can you short out a car?

31:47.197 --> 31:50.315
Charlie, we should necessarily from Highway
down. It will soon be night and we...

31:50.992 --> 31:55.157
One of those things might come in
reinlaufen us and demolish the car.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.907
Forget it! I do not let that one
my car scrapped of these things.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.578
One of those things, huh?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.053
Ah! Shit!

32:17.727 --> 32:19.593
What is this? What the hell did you
I sprayed?

32:22.190 --> 32:23.806
What the hell did you injected me?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.311
How long do you take already
Chandlers pharmaceuticals?

32:25.444 --> 32:27.686
What have you injected me?
- How long do you get on, Charlie?

32:27.737 --> 32:29.478
If you do not tell me
what you have sprayed me

32:29.614 --> 32:31.196
I'll blow your fucking brains out.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.281
What I gave you, might possibly
,

32:33.368 --> 32:37.863
or even almost certainly save your life.
Listen, I'm not the problem,

32:37.956 --> 32:40.073
I'm just looking for a
solution, like you, Charlie.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.331
You have to begin to trust me.
Now give me those pills.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.667
Give me the pills, Charlie!

32:51.344 --> 32:52.676
Give me the pills.

32:55.849 --> 33:01.720
There was only one, okay? A single!
From Pillbox my old man!

33:06.902 --> 33:07.938
A?

33:14.201 --> 33:19.367
Hey, Beau. Yes, Bro. Look, I get
and a friend with you over.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.406
With you it is not any better, eh?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.700
Good. It's for one night.

33:25.587 --> 33:29.456
All right, we see
us then. Merci, Bro.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.504
We spend the night in Lafayette
. Hey, Aldous.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.673
That I wegblase you the brain,
was not serious.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.927
So, my listeners would explain every crazy for
who claims

33:43.063 --> 33:44.725
I had a brain. Ha!

33:45.899 --> 33:48.516
But listen indeed no
Alex Jones, if you ask me.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.312
Of this you've had enough.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.420
Who the hell do we have here?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.918
Everything ok with you? Why
you are walking on the road?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.295
You do not know, that here is a
run around some nasty characters?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.846
We're out of gas, and
all gas stations are closed.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.973
We wanted to tap into here
to come to Texas.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.025
Look here, old man! I know
not know what you're doing,

34:31.152 --> 34:33.860
but you should put down the fucking gun
. Immediately! Okay?

34:34.030 --> 34:37.739
Charlie, what are you doing? Come back
! Are you tired of life?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.241
Do you know who do not
and have weapons!

34:44.541 --> 34:46.453
Hey, hey. You will now
immediately go back!

34:47.210 --> 34:48.701
Charlie, what are you doing?

34:49.212 --> 34:50.498
Holy shit.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.003
You are.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.258
Now if that is not my favorite dancer
from all over New Orleans!

35:01.016 --> 35:04.350
Okay! You're the guy from the bar
, the musician,

35:04.436 --> 35:05.802
with whom I've been drinking the Short!

35:05.937 --> 35:06.973
That's right.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.273
I do not know what you
has devious here,

35:11.401 --> 35:16.521
on this side of the road in South
Lafayette, but I get a hug?

35:16.656 --> 35:17.487
Yes.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.442
What the hell are you doing out here?

35:23.747 --> 35:25.033
Thibideaux!

35:25.165 --> 35:26.622
This is my buddy Beau.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.414
How about if we move our
reunion inside,

35:30.503 --> 35:32.495
where it's safe? Who knows what
running around out here?

35:32.631 --> 35:37.001
Yes. Let us go in, because
it is safer. Come with me.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.513
Now come on!

35:51.441 --> 35:53.558
I've told you, that you shall stay away from
my property.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.437
Thibideaux!

35:57.572 --> 36:03.159
Slide your ass over here!
Clean with you! And you too! You too! Not you!

36:10.418 --> 36:13.001
Hey man. Welcomes you always
as an old buddy?

36:13.129 --> 36:14.745
I can not
believe that you are still alive.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.169
Mr. Boudreaux  I do not know you, but
I love you already.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.841
Thank you very much, let
embrace. Thank you, thank you.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.883
Just call me Beau. Everything is going well
. You gotta worry about.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.683
Thea. Thank you very much.
- Call me Beau.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.180
Katie Ann. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.269
Nice to have you here.
Listen ago. You all look,

36:31.398 --> 36:33.060
as if you could tolerate a fucking drink.
Follow me.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.060
Amen.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.526
This here will prescribe you
every doctor, just that

36:37.612 --> 36:39.945
This is a Bon-Tom-Rule-Ey.
Treat yourself to a drink.

36:40.031 --> 36:40.896
Sit down.

36:42.242 --> 36:43.983
I would like to propose a toast.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.574
Namely the prettiest
burlesque dancer in Crescent City.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.617
Hear, hear.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.865
Only  we can not so fully run
leave, like last time.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.791
Otherwise we end up as
food for these creatures.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.750
Absolutely not.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.837
Here is Aldous Huxtable of KGCR Radio!

36:56.965 --> 36:59.048
I call our friends
in Southern Louisiana,

36:59.175 --> 37:02.088
that there will be no
creature feed today!

37:02.178 --> 37:04.135
I'll drink, brother.
- Hear, hear.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.138
Is exactly what I meant.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.721
So, you're the
conspiracy theory type from the radio?

37:13.857 --> 37:17.601
Oh, you gave me so many times awarded this item.
These and many others.

37:17.736 --> 37:21.776
No, Madam, I am many things, but I'm not a conspiracy theorist
.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.070
This is what traitors, and that, my
love, is something that I'm not.

37:25.869 --> 37:29.613
Wow. Traitor, yes? Then
you want me certainly do not know.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.613
Yes, I want.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.452
Come on, guys. Let's chill out a bit
and a good...

37:32.542 --> 37:33.578
No, let him speak calmly.

37:33.668 --> 37:37.082
No, no, no, Charlie.
I want to get to know you. I just wonder,

37:37.172 --> 37:39.129
out what you want on the highway here.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.628
You have weapons and told us
, you want after Texas.

37:41.718 --> 37:46.179
So, Al. I want to be a part of the problem
more, but be part of the solution.

37:46.306 --> 37:51.051
And that's why I want to go to Austin,
to me there to take care of my karma.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.637
And when I get there, I find Willie Nelson

37:55.523 --> 37:57.731
and smoke a cigarette with the jazz man.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.191
Oh, I'm with you.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.776
Do not worry about your karma.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.738
We work for Rush Chandler,
why we are here.

38:03.865 --> 38:06.232
Wow. Hello. She has spoken.

38:06.367 --> 38:11.158
Yes . And She talks a lot. Rush
Chandler? You work for Rush Chandler?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.281
You belong to "Chandler pharmaceuticals".

38:14.000 --> 38:17.710
Your expertise, you are the
Black Rain Security.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.124
Hi. Katie Ann. Perhaps
you know my dad.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.875
I am the former heiress
of Black Rain Security.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.334
Former heiress?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.253
The former! Nice to meet you
.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.923
Nice to meet you, Katie Ann.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.351
Then I will now times
pronounce a toast.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.513
You had to endure a certain amount of

38:37.649 --> 38:39.140
by the corrupt machinations of your father.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.768
And the evils that
has he done as a mercenary.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.193
I'll dedicate this toast, because
you had the courage to stand up

38:48.243 --> 38:49.575
to find your truth

38:49.744 --> 38:52.703
and my faith in humanity
restore.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.621
In these hard times.
- Amen!

38:55.041 --> 38:56.282
God bless us all!

38:59.587 --> 39:02.830
We turn on the system and celebrate
a goddamn hurricane party.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.485
I talked to Karen next door.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.106
And she says that all your
Rotary Club meeting

40:10.199 --> 40:11.906
have been  canceled until further notice.

40:11.993 --> 40:15.361
And these creatures have invaded your new sevens in

40:15.455 --> 40:16.866
and have totally devastated him.

40:16.956 --> 40:22.748
Imagine only? A 750 full of creatures
-goo on the new seats! Ih!

40:24.339 --> 40:27.002
Ha? Yeah, it's terrible, sweetness.

40:27.717 --> 40:31.301
And the Louis Vuitton suitcase that you
you bought me is not big enough.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.591
Can I take all of my dolls?

40:33.765 --> 40:37.179
No, sweetie! You can not take all of
. Just one.

40:38.895 --> 40:42.184
Princess? You get new
dolls when we are there.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.815
One thing I do not understand!
Why do not we take the corporate jet?

40:47.904 --> 40:49.645
I mean, you're the...

40:49.739 --> 40:53.824
There is no flight zone over New Orleans.
I already told you 20 times.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.488
Here nothing makes sense.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.202
We're going on an armed truck

40:57.330 --> 40:58.741
to run away before genetically modified freaks
?

40:58.873 --> 41:00.910
How much do I have again for this damn tv
paid?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.166
Watch your mouth!

41:03.294 --> 41:04.455
But does not matter anyway.

41:05.296 --> 41:09.381
In addition, the jet would be faster.
And I do not,

41:09.509 --> 41:11.592
like this armed truck looks.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.337
And that should rather not damage my suitcase
,

41:14.472 --> 41:16.759
otherwise you have to buy me a new set
, Buddy Boy.

41:16.849 --> 41:19.592
I do not want a new doll.
I want my dolls.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.679
Sweetie? Would you
exceptionally stop?

42:00.935 --> 42:03.222
Hey Jim. Did you find out anything?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.437
Charlie, we found your dad.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.976
It was because of the drugs that take all
other. It was an overdose.

42:11.738 --> 42:12.774
Charlie!

42:13.948 --> 42:15.314
Charlie? Is what happened?

42:17.243 --> 42:21.157
No, no, no.
I am still there. Listen...

42:22.165 --> 42:26.034
Thank you for everything you've done.
I know you can not help it.

42:27.712 --> 42:28.828
I have to go.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.204
I'm sorry.

43:42.662 --> 43:46.281
I started with guitar and accordion playing
in the Louisiana music scene.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.620
I do not think it's true,
but I am curious if it is true.

44:23.369 --> 44:26.737
Charlie. Listen to me carefully.

44:29.375 --> 44:36.168
You'll make it. Thinking
always turn everything will be fine again.

44:38.134 --> 44:42.925
You have no choice,
Bro. There is no one more.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.715
You have to fix it .

45:20.426 --> 45:22.668
Hey man, what's going
outside for a shit?

45:22.803 --> 45:25.045
Age, non-steering from.
Do prefer the coal clear

45:25.181 --> 45:27.138
if I told you busted their ass
here.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.870
Hey, you cocksucker.
Are you tired of life?

45:54.961 --> 45:55.917
Yeah, Bitch!

46:52.101 --> 46:53.683
Good morning, dear people.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.552
Aldous!
- Good morning, Aldous.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.353
Morning, Morning.
- How are we doing since this morning?

46:57.440 --> 46:58.521
Good morning.
- Terrific.

46:58.649 --> 47:02.518
Good. I'm still not quite with me.
I need something from this Joe.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.442
Toll.

47:04.071 --> 47:08.156
Boudreaux, that's really good stuff
. So really good.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.449
You've experienced a lot, my friend.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.868
Yes and now I need a pick-me-
, ha?

47:12.079 --> 47:13.820
Merci beaucoup!
- Thank you.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.990
Something tells me that we should make a whole pot
,

47:17.084 --> 47:19.622
For the old Charlie-boy. Your
know, the funny musicians

47:19.754 --> 47:21.746
slept through the whole day.
Is lazy like that.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.918
I have a lot of coffee,
we still cook some.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.001
I have the feeling that the good Charlie
last night had a tough night.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.339
Not only Charlie.

47:28.846 --> 47:29.802
Yes.

47:29.889 --> 47:32.472
Oh, and Boudreaux! We still need a lot of fuel
,

47:32.600 --> 47:35.058
to these pretty ladies on
to bring the border into Texas.

47:35.144 --> 47:36.885
I was wondering if you do not know

47:36.979 --> 47:38.766
where the nearest open gas station
could be.

47:38.898 --> 47:42.642
The stations are sure
all, man. But do not worry,

47:42.777 --> 47:45.315
I tanks in the barracks, the
can take her from me all.

47:45.446 --> 47:46.687
I appreciate, Beau.

47:46.864 --> 47:51.950
Oh, Katie Ann! I'll give you my number,
in the event that we are separated.

47:52.078 --> 47:54.991
We should always be
in contact with each other, you know?

47:55.081 --> 47:56.071
Here you go.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.952
Oh yes, thank you very much.

47:58.459 --> 48:02.624
This is the first time in 15 years that I am
am not listening to the radio,

48:02.755 --> 48:05.418
with the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast
.

48:05.925 --> 48:07.632
This feels somehow
weird, you know?

48:07.760 --> 48:09.342
My friend, it'll get better.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.634
The people will never forget you.
You will come back stronger than ever,

48:12.765 --> 48:14.347
if those goddamn things are first disappeared.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.766
God bless you, Boudreaux.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.763
Listen times. Before you now all
goes, I want to give you something

48:20.898 --> 48:23.936
that means a lot to me and
of which I think it will help you.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.311
I brought the formerly very
best of luck.

48:27.405 --> 48:32.321
It is a lucky chain. You wear around your neck
, and if you sit in a jam

48:32.451 --> 48:36.912
or get into trouble on your way,
then rubs and kisses her she.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.786
This will help you and
they will bring you happiness.

48:40.292 --> 48:41.828
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48:41.877 --> 48:44.915
I'll tell you what brings me happiness.
A little more whiskey in my coffee.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.587
Yes...
- The signs of the times.

48:46.674 --> 48:49.382
I'll tell you what. I'll drink!
- Yes? So go ahead.

48:49.468 --> 48:50.754
This was a tough week.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.424
This is really what
special. Thank you very much.

48:53.514 --> 48:57.599
She has helped me and I
know they will also help you.

48:59.103 --> 49:02.141
Le-Bon-Tom-Rulee.
- Right. Le-Bon-Tom-Rulee.

49:02.690 --> 49:08.561
Good morning! Aldous Huxtable! KGCR!
It starts! Come on, party animal!

49:08.654 --> 49:12.989
Get up finally! Ha! High
with you, you old gunslinger!

49:13.117 --> 49:14.483
Do the whole night celebrating...

49:14.577 --> 49:16.364
Oh man. Shit. Give me a minute.

49:16.495 --> 49:18.487
Hey, your girlfriends are
also have long,

49:18.581 --> 49:20.322
had your go-go juice
and are gone. Good bye!

49:21.459 --> 49:24.293
The're friends, the
is true. But not mine.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.666
Women who like women?

49:27.756 --> 49:30.214
Yes. Something of that nature

49:30.342 --> 49:34.837
mower. Really?
Oh my God. Run!

49:37.683 --> 49:39.219
Kiss my ass.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.219
This is the first goddamn
times that come in here.

49:42.938 --> 49:44.770
I should quickly
nail up the windows.

49:44.857 --> 49:47.395
Hold dear your head
down, Mr. Boudreaux.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.021
The locals here in the
area are quite uncomfortable.

49:49.111 --> 49:51.603
One more bad news men.
The pretty girls are already gone.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.485
I wanted to bring you  the car
, but you would not let me.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.908
The work it out,
man. They are tough.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.242
Hey. Hold on there.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.254
I need to freshen up short.
Will you come here alone right?

50:13.385 --> 50:14.501
No. I come to prefer.
- Okay.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.257
We should take in hand the
feet.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.720
We still have to overcome a lot of
Highway.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.138
I would take the side streets.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.217
He's right. We
the Blue Highway route.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.183
Is a side street!

52:27.269 --> 52:28.350
Shit.

53:13.732 --> 53:17.726
Katie Ann, Katie Ann, here is your old pal
Aldous. Aldous and Charlie.

53:17.820 --> 53:20.528
Wanted to check in times where your just
infected. Between the A and the T's?

53:21.323 --> 53:26.068
Hey, just call us, if you have time for us
. Your Aldous Huxtable logs off.

53:26.620 --> 53:29.863
Shit. Women. You
can not with them...

53:29.957 --> 53:33.792
And can not without. Have you ever been married
?

53:33.877 --> 53:34.993
I?
- Yes.

53:35.087 --> 53:40.048
No. I sometimes do not understand myself.
I want to do anyone's.

53:40.134 --> 53:43.593
I am a lot of things for a lot of people
. But I do not want that.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.428
I do not believe it. What about you?

53:45.556 --> 53:49.425
No! I was never married.
I travel a lot, you know?

53:49.518 --> 53:50.258
Yes?

53:50.811 --> 53:55.931
Yes. Katie Ann and Thea,
which are really tough, man.

53:56.442 --> 53:58.104
They are perhaps already there.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.271
Can be.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.692
Maybe you want half an orange? What?

54:03.741 --> 54:06.199
Aldous, you're a crazy
pork cheek, you know?

54:06.326 --> 54:10.195
Yes, I say what I think. And
I do not understand this world.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.760
Oh, shit! Shit!

54:38.066 --> 54:41.104
So if I was to just not awake,
then I am now, I tell you.

55:08.972 --> 55:12.306
Do you know where you want to go? Here
out there you do not survive long.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.471
You're driving in the wrong direction
. There are all dead

55:15.604 --> 55:16.936
How many are there?

55:17.064 --> 55:18.600
More than you can even imagine.

55:19.608 --> 55:20.974
How did you survive?

55:21.235 --> 55:23.272
That's not important.
I want to go home.

55:26.532 --> 55:27.818
Rest in peace.

55:33.705 --> 55:34.786
Hey Al.

55:34.915 --> 55:36.952
Hey Katie Ann. How are you?
- Are you okay?

55:37.084 --> 55:42.250
Oh, yes. Everything here is
in the green zone. Everything's fine.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.376
We are in Texas since precisely.

55:44.925 --> 55:48.635
Ah, you're in Texas, really? Yes.
We have been here a while.

55:48.762 --> 55:52.176
Oh, cool. We had planned to shift down a gear
and take a break.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.474
Oh, you're now also
finally in Texas? We wanted...

55:55.936 --> 55:58.394
Aldous, give it to me! Give me the phone!
- What?

55:59.690 --> 56:03.309
Hey Katie, listen. I think we should
what to look for the night.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.103
My buddy has a boat
somewhere in the no man's land.

56:06.238 --> 56:09.356
It is on the way to Austin.
We could remain there overnight.

56:09.491 --> 56:10.527
Since we are safe.

56:10.659 --> 56:14.403
I'll send you the address. We
'll meet you in an hour, okay?

56:14.538 --> 56:16.530
Yes. We're starving. How
it looks at you?

56:16.623 --> 56:18.080
We keep and get something to eat.

56:18.417 --> 56:20.158
Cool. Sounds like a plan.

56:20.627 --> 56:21.868
Alright. Be careful.

56:24.715 --> 56:25.831
It starts, baby.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.379
What was that?

56:29.511 --> 56:33.221
I wanted to preserve our dignity.
We are the sons of the South.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.217
We can certainly draw no wenches before
drive us across the border.

56:37.352 --> 56:38.263
Come on!

56:38.645 --> 56:40.227
Can you stop doing, Aldous?

56:48.947 --> 56:50.358
We are doing the same out of gas.

56:50.407 --> 56:53.275
Yes, we are... We
keeping anyway soon.

56:55.162 --> 56:58.246
I told you, this
hybrid vehicles that drive and drive,

56:58.332 --> 57:02.417
the longest distances. The use
as good as nothing, absolutely nothing.

57:02.878 --> 57:04.870
But it's all about the money.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.431
Quiet.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.566
It is better you wait here.

57:31.698 --> 57:32.688
Yeah, okay.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.051
I need a beer.

57:59.893 --> 58:00.804
Clear.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.474
Let's have a drink. The
we now have really earned.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.523
A lemon soda for you, little lady.

58:11.655 --> 58:12.645
Thank you, Aldous.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.571
See  Let's see if the radio works.

58:22.499 --> 58:23.660
All right, babe?

58:25.210 --> 58:26.291
I'm starving.

58:26.420 --> 58:27.627
Al, the distributed times.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.132
Okay?

58:35.303 --> 58:36.464
Supervisors survival!

58:37.305 --> 58:38.591
Feel initiated.

58:51.528 --> 58:57.115
I lean out the window and tell
what might all think straight.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.234
And what might that be?

59:00.620 --> 59:02.327
Hopefully can not swim the
things.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.781
Do you think only of the? What is
with all of us here?

59:05.709 --> 59:07.541
For you I've got a
lifesaver, Aldous.

59:08.253 --> 59:11.792
Heavens, no. I just wanted to say
I have never been a big hero in the pool.

59:12.591 --> 59:15.629
Also, some of you have send them
buoyancy aids.

59:18.638 --> 59:21.130
The lock and the door
appear to be stable.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.844
Whether that can now swim or
not, we will conclude. Stay here.

59:25.937 --> 59:28.805
Do you want to protect us now?
Prior to these big, bad monsters?

59:29.608 --> 59:30.644
Are you serious, Thea?

59:30.734 --> 59:31.645
Totally.

59:31.777 --> 59:36.192
Better than nothing, I always say.
What do you say, something to eat?

59:36.990 --> 59:38.902
I think we could all do with what
.

59:44.456 --> 59:45.788
What is this, Aldous?

59:51.213 --> 59:55.878
I put it this way: preserves the
in front of us to be like the.

59:57.469 --> 01:00:01.088
I've kept it safe
. For emergencies.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.310
Shrimp, poor guy.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:41.945
Help!

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:47.735
Thea! Your damn crap things!

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:00.331
Thea!

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.180
Katie Ann, do not! The
brings nothing!

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.852
No, no, no, no. Do not!

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:15.221
Let them go. You can not help her
. We must disappear.

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:05.112
Since we were before.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:11.201
The fuel goes on the company card.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:18.292
Oh no, no, no. Fuck. Fuck.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.339
Holy shit.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:42.016
I just want a fair chance.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.116
Fuck you!

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.549
Excuse me, but I have to pay short
the water bill.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.259
Can you stop for a moment, Charlie?
- Yes.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.133
Yes ?
- No problem.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.930
This will not take long, you know
her? Is not a very big bill.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.179
Yes. Aldous?

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.725
Take the. Just in case.
- Really?

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.396
Yes.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.685
Okay. I think you're right.
Will you sleepy, you'll limp.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.937
It is said that the people make the worst decisions
,

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:29.234
if you are tired and hungry.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.821
Yes. If that were the case, then we would have
both dead now, and so do you.

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:36.324
Mindfulness and not carelessness.
- Right.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:41.668
Hey. We can do it,
Katie. We'll make it

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.211
Katie? Katie!

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.193
Gentlemen, I want to see your cards.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.984
Yes, sir. We are from
New Orleans, Louisiana.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.903
We are here to let us help in Texas
of your scientists.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.823
The  I appreciate that, son.
- Aldous, let me do that.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.780
Yes, sir.
- S. ..

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.916
Hey, hey, hey.
I have a valid firearms license for it.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:31.996
A bit too much filling for a
penis on four wheels, you two doves.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.173
Wow, wow, wow, wow! Hey, hey!
- Wow, wow. Slowly!

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.046
She Holt out of the car!
- Out of the car! Get out!

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:38.422
Hey, we're in America.
We have the right to bear arms.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:39.716
Gentlemen! Out of the car!

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.009
The hands over his head!

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.263
All right, all right!
- This is utter bullshit.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:46.469
I want to see your hands!
The hands on the hood!

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:51.399
Her way to treat your neighbors? We need your help
, and so you treat us?

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.391
You keep quiet, sir.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.268
You  wannabe John Wayne, motherfuckers!

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.853
God bless John Wayne.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.745
Okay. Are you coming straight from hell?

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.744
Me should not look so pissed you prefer
.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:11.874
No, sir. We are not the
problem. We look for the solution.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.122
It revolves around the
good people of New Orleans,

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.298
not about us and not about you.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:20.343
Young,
here is all just about me.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:21.883
Yes, sir.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:25.094
I have only one Father, and
I wonder, do you know him?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.649
Will we have
with you a problem if we solve your bonds?

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.359
No, sir!

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.787
That would be all men.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:54.625
I want you now
told me why you two turns up here

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.548
and have more weapons than the Branch Davidians
.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.877
What? They capture us,
bind my hands,

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.049
hurt our civil rights,
our right to be armed...

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.218
Aldous! Aldous!
-... and you want information?

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:05.968
Soldier!

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.053
The next word from
his Schandmaul you shoot him!

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.807
Aldous, hold at least once
mouth, okay? Let me talk.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:20.738
I would listen to the advice of your friend
, if I were you, boy!

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:33.412
Sir, the reason why we look
, like hell, is,

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.995
that we were in hell and back.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:42.046
Do not worry, I tire
Do not with details.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:47.973
Oh. No, no, no, boy.
Weary me. Weary me.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.691
This is not my mom, who would only
so what to do to her?

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.325
All the people here in the area
loved my family.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.158
This shit makes no sense.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.514
Boy? Boy!

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.218
Are you okay?
- Charlie?

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:18.646
Yes. Excuse me, sir.
It was all a bit much.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:22.401
Gentlemen, here is someone who
would like to speak with them.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:29.654
Ah, Commander.
I have your prescriptions.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.152
Thank you very much.

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:33.578
So I knew you would come both
.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.654
Did you know it?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.418
Dr. Soulis?
- Oh my God, Peter.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.919
Good to see you. I
knew that I meet you.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:45.792
Well, Charlie? We had almost made it to the top
.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.258
Hang in there, brother. It is
not over until it's over.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.923
We have no control over.

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.845
We have had long
no longer under control.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:03.768
I've always believed very firmly,
you cease only to fight,

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.193
if one is no more.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.898
This is too great, Charlie.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:13.861
This is just too great.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.412
This is good news. The only
what we should have to find out

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:22.127
is a bit about your contacts
to the infected people, yes?

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:28.543
Ha. That you can forget it. You will not get
my blood. Over my dead body.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:32.762
Zwing him not to, kid.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.508
I think this is
a suggestive opinion.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:41.225
You take me no blood from
! What you injected us?

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:43.648
I curse you, for
the rest of your life.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:46.814
Charlie splashing
you something! What the hell is that?

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:52.571
What the hell is going on here?
You sons of bitches!

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:00.039
How are you? Good?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.587
There's a call for you, Doctor.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:10.839
Listen. If they die, we can use the
organs.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.629
Thank you, Commander.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.304
Yes? Yes, sir. Yes!

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:21.562
Well, thank you very much. I believe that.

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:25.899
I say to you quite frankly, the
Phase One was an enormous success.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:30.901
Yes, the New Orleans experiment
is making great progress.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.240
We just go about it.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:41.658
Yes. Smaller tests are now available at the row
. This is the beginning of Phase Two.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:43.624
Thank you very much.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.381
Very good. That one does not look really healthy
, Commander. What would you say?

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:53.631
The creates that already.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:57.715
Your sons of bitches. Oh God...

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.848
Your sons of bitches.
- Aldous? Be careful.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:04.433
What have you done to us?

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.891
Calm down and breathe deeply
. Calm down.

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:10.985
And let act the serum.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.982
You shitty government puppet
and your Fidel Castro cocksucker.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:21.246
Still no manners.
He ââhas never had any.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.037
Well, we want then?

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.752
I made me real worried about you
, man. What about you, Soulis?

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.499
Give him something!

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:45.371
Good.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:46.622
Thank you very much.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.147
Hey, buddy. How was your day?

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:16.191
Let me go short. I want to see what makes
Mom. I'll be back at you.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.938
Treasure you come again?
- Yes, I'm coming.
