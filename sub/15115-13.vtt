<i>AND THE FUNDAMENTAL</i>
<i>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</i>

00:48.559 --> 00:50.080
<i>AN "S" CORP</i>
<i>AND A "C" CORP</i>

00:50.080 --> 00:52.763
<i>IS EXPECTED INCOME</i>
<i>AND SUBSEQUENT EXPECTED</i>
<i>PROFIT MARGIN.</i>

00:52.763 --> 00:54.284
‐ ( groans loudly )
‐ <i>IN THE EXAMPLE I GAVE,</i>

00:54.284 --> 00:58.088
THE TAXABLE INCOME
FOR YOUR "S" CORP WOULD

00:58.088 --> 01:01.492
<i>INDIRECTLY BENEFIT</i>
<i>SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE</i>
<i>TAXED DIRECTLY ON THEIR 1040.</i>

01:01.492 --> 01:04.655
NOW, NONE OF THIS ADDRESSES
THE PROBLEM OF HOW YOU MEET
YOUR OPERATING COSTS,

01:04.655 --> 01:07.938
WHILE MAINTAINING SOMETHING
WITH MORE FORTITUDE THAN
AN L. L. C.

01:07.938 --> 01:11.141
<i>THE "S" CORP CAN PURCHASE</i>
<i>LIABILITY INSURANCE ON</i>
<i>YOUR BEHALF,</i>

01:11.141 --> 01:14.985
<i>BUT THE DOWNSIDE</i>
<i>OF LIABILITY INSURANCE</i>
<i>PURCHASED BY AN ENTITY MEANT</i>

01:14.985 --> 01:17.508
<i>TO BE A PASS‐THROUGH</i>
<i>FOR TAX PURPOSES IS</i>
<i>SIGNIFICANT.</i>

01:17.508 --> 01:20.511
NOW AS FOR THE PROFIT
AND LOSS COLUMN YOU
FINALLY INCLUDED‐‐

01:22.032 --> 01:23.033
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:23.033 --> 01:25.876
‐ WHAT?
‐ I CAN SEE YOU.

01:25.876 --> 01:27.718
I CAN SEE ALL
THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING.

01:27.718 --> 01:30.441
I'M SORRY, WE'RE TRYING.
WE ATE POWER BARS
BEFORE COMING.

01:30.441 --> 01:31.962
I JUMPED ON
A TRAMPOLINE.

01:31.962 --> 01:34.004
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IMPORTANT FINANCIAL MATTERS,

01:34.004 --> 01:36.447
BUT AS USUAL, NEITHER OF YOU
IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

01:36.447 --> 01:37.448
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:37.448 --> 01:38.569
WE GOT RID
OF THE HATBOXES,

01:38.569 --> 01:40.691
‐ WE BOUGHT A BINDER.
‐ A "SOUTH PARK" BINDER.

01:40.691 --> 01:41.812
WHAT, NUMBERS
CAN'T BE FUN?

01:41.812 --> 01:43.013
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

01:43.013 --> 01:45.015
THE TWO OF YOU ARE CHILDREN.

01:45.015 --> 01:46.657
YOU SAY YOU'RE TRYING
TO RUN A BUSINESS,

01:46.657 --> 01:48.258
BUT YOU DON'T CHARGE
HALF YOUR STUDENTS.

01:48.258 --> 01:49.500
‐ HER FAULT.
‐ <i>YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE</i>

01:49.500 --> 01:51.782
TO LOSE MONEY
ON YOUR ANNUAL FUNDRAISER.

01:51.782 --> 01:52.943
‐ HER FAULT.
‐ YOU THINK YOU CAN

01:52.943 --> 01:55.265
CLOSE DOWN THE STUDIO
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A BAD DAY.

01:55.265 --> 01:56.987
‐ YEAH, WELL, BOTH OF US.
‐ THAT'S BOTH OF US.

01:56.987 --> 01:58.989
YOU ACT AS IF YOU HAVE
A THRIVING BUSINESS AND
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD,

01:58.989 --> 02:01.271
BUT YOU DON'T.
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE

02:01.271 --> 02:03.273
IS A NOT‐FOR‐PROFIT DANCE
SCHOOL AND A LOT OF LAND

02:03.273 --> 02:04.755
THAT'S JUST SITTING
OUT THERE DOING NOTHING.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.797
‐ WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO DO?
‐ <i>IT'S LAND!</i>

02:06.797 --> 02:08.999
IT'S WHAT EVERYTHING
IN COMMERCE IS BASED ON.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.160
<i>LOOK, IF THE LAND</i>
<i>ISN'T VALUABLE,</i>

02:10.160 --> 02:12.443
THEN MAYBE SOMETHING
ON THE LAND IS VALUABLE.

02:12.443 --> 02:13.764
LIKE WE HAVE GOLD
IN THEM THERE HILLS?

02:13.764 --> 02:15.766
‐ I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.
‐ OH, BUT YOU SAY IT POSSIBLE,

02:15.766 --> 02:17.408
SO WE SHOULD PAN
FOR GOLD.

02:17.408 --> 02:18.649
GET A DONKEY
AND A SLUICER.

02:18.649 --> 02:19.930
WHAT'S A SLUICER?

02:19.930 --> 02:21.972
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT PANNING FOR GOLD.

02:21.972 --> 02:23.534
A SLUICER‐‐
THAT THING THAT SLUICES.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.856
‐ I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.
‐ FOR GOLD.

02:25.856 --> 02:27.538
<i>IN THE RIVER‐‐ YOU GO IN,</i>
<i>YOU GET THE ROCKS AND YOU...</i>

02:27.538 --> 02:28.739
( mimics rattling )

02:28.739 --> 02:30.140
‐ THAT'S CALLED
A SLUICER?
‐ YEAH.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.141
LET'S LOOK IT UP
ON THE INTERNET.

02:31.141 --> 02:32.943
NO. NO.
NO INTERNET.

02:32.943 --> 02:35.946
NO SLEEPING
OR HOLDING YOUR EYES OPEN
OR MIMING KILLING YOURSELF.

02:35.946 --> 02:38.429
YES, I SAW THAT.
WE'RE DONE.

02:38.429 --> 02:39.710
WE'RE SORRY.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.752
PLEASE, JUST TELL US
WHAT TO DO WITH OUR LAND.

02:41.752 --> 02:43.994
I DON'T CARE!
ANYTHING.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.676
I HAVE CLIENTS
WHO HAVE STABLES.

02:45.676 --> 02:47.798
THEY GIVE PONY RIDES.
THAT EARNS INCOME.

02:47.798 --> 02:50.681
<i>YOU HAVE TWO FARMS</i>
<i>IN YOUR VICINITY.</i>
<i>THAT EARNS INCOME.</i>

02:50.681 --> 02:52.843
THERE'S AN OSTRICH FARM
THREE MILES AWAY,

02:52.843 --> 02:54.325
AN ALPACA FARM
RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

02:55.766 --> 02:57.047
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
TO GET ALPACAS.

02:57.047 --> 02:58.449
I HOPE NOT.
DOESN'T SEEM SAFE

02:58.449 --> 02:59.810

AROUND.

THE SAME
TERRIFYING MOVIE,

03:30.681 --> 03:33.684
THE SAME 1976
"MIRACLE OF LIFE."

03:33.684 --> 03:34.845
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MIRACLE IS?

03:34.845 --> 03:36.487
THAT ANYBODY
GOT PREGNANT GIVEN

03:36.487 --> 03:37.888
THE AMOUNT
OF BODY HAIR GOING ON.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.490
NO MORE TALKING.
I'M ALREADY NAUSEOUS.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.091
WHY DO THEY EVEN
CALL IT HEALTH CLASS?

03:41.091 --> 03:43.694
WHAT'S HEALTHY ABOUT IT?!
YOU COME OUT, YOU'RE SICK!

03:43.694 --> 03:44.855
THEY SHOULD CALL IT
SICK CLASS.

03:44.855 --> 03:46.297
THANKS, SEINFELD.

03:48.098 --> 03:49.900
WOW.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.382
Melanie:
<i>ARE THEY ORGANIZING A UNION?</i>

03:51.382 --> 03:52.743
Ginny:
<i>OCCUPYING WALL STREET?</i>

03:52.743 --> 03:54.144
<i>DOING THE FINALE</i>
<i>FROM "LES MIS."</i>

03:54.144 --> 03:55.826
‐ THAT WAS IT!
‐ ( applause )

03:55.826 --> 03:58.829
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THEY GOT SO POPULAR
SO FAST.

03:58.829 --> 04:00.551
MAYBE THEY GIVE OUT
THE FULL‐SIZE CANDY BARS

04:00.551 --> 04:01.952
AT HALLOWEEN.

04:01.952 --> 04:03.594
( indistinct chattering )

04:05.235 --> 04:07.037
WAIT.
JUST WANNA SEE

04:07.037 --> 04:08.439
IF THEY SHOW UP
ON FILM.

04:08.439 --> 04:09.960
‐ OR ON PHONE.
‐ <i>( school bell rings )</i>

04:09.960 --> 04:11.041

TO SASHA AND BOO.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.723
TELL THEM ABOUT THE LAUGHTER
AND THE APPLAUSE,

04:12.723 --> 04:14.325
AND THE CASUAL LEANING
THAT IS SO CLEARLY REHEARSED.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.887
‐ ON IT.
‐ MEL.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.729
HOLD ON.
STUPID SMART TYPE

04:18.729 --> 04:20.331
KEEPS CHANGING "APPLAUSE"

<i>WHY DIDN'T YOU</i>
<i>ANSWER MY MESSAGE?</i>

04:21.932 --> 04:23.654
UM, WOW. I DON'T KNOW.

Mel:
<i>PONYTAIL GIRL IS GIVING HIM</i>
<i>A HARD TIME AGAIN.</i>

04:24.775 --> 04:27.618
YES, AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
STUDYING IS FOR YOU.

04:27.618 --> 04:30.220
YOU'RE SO
INCREDIBLY STUDIOUS.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.742

‐ WHATEVER!

04:31.742 --> 04:33.904

I'M DONE.

04:33.904 --> 04:34.905
SERIOUSLY?

04:34.905 --> 04:36.907
‐ DID SHE JUST DUMP HIM?
‐ YEP.

04:36.907 --> 04:38.749
‐ IN PUBLIC.
‐ YEP.

04:38.749 --> 04:40.751
CAN I BUY HER
A FRICKIN' PONY?

04:40.751 --> 04:41.832
PUT ME DOWN FOR HALF.

04:41.832 --> 04:42.993
JUST GIVE ME
MY SWEATSHIRT BACK.

04:42.993 --> 04:45.155
Charlie:
<i>IT'S MY SWEATSHIRT!</i>
<i>FINE!</i>

04:45.155 --> 04:47.358
YOU WANT MY SWEATSHIRT SO
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO
REMEMBER ME BY?

04:47.358 --> 04:48.759
I GET IT.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.723
Crowd:
OH!

04:52.723 --> 04:53.924
( all murmuring )

04:59.570 --> 05:00.811
AND CUT.

05:00.811 --> 05:02.252
HELLO, SUNDANCE.

05:03.934 --> 05:05.576
Michelle:
I'M SORRY, CAN WE FIRE HIM?
'CAUSE HE'S A JERK.

05:05.576 --> 05:06.817
Fanny:
HE'S YOUR GUY.

05:06.817 --> 05:08.178
HE'S NOT MY GUY.
I JUST GOOGLED

05:08.178 --> 05:09.940
"ACCOUNTANT" AND "PARADISE"
AND THIS IS WHAT CAME UP.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.782
TERRIFIC. SO HE'S
A "BETTER CALL SAUL"?

05:11.782 --> 05:13.384
HIS "YELP" REVIEWS
WERE PRETTY STRONG.

05:13.384 --> 05:15.386
"YELP" IS FOR PEOPLE
WHO PHOTOGRAPH THEIR FOOD.

05:15.386 --> 05:16.867
Fanny:
OOH, CANDLES.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.229
WELL, ALL I KNOW IS
I CAN NEVER GO BACK
IN THAT OFFICE AGAIN,

05:19.229 --> 05:20.791
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME
HE OPENS HIS MOUTH,

05:20.791 --> 05:22.873
I'M GOING TO HAUL OFF
AND SLAP HIS FACE,

05:22.873 --> 05:23.994
AND THEN I'LL JUST BE
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN

05:23.994 --> 05:25.636
WHO GOES AROUND
SLAPPING FACES.

05:25.636 --> 05:27.438
SUDDENLY I'M
ZSA ZSA GABOR.

05:27.438 --> 05:28.679
‐ Michelle:
THEY'RE CUTE, THOUGH.
‐ WHAT?

05:28.679 --> 05:29.840
‐ ALPACAS.
‐ MICHELLE.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.882
HE'S FIRED.
WE HATE HIM.

05:31.882 --> 05:34.485
SO WHAT NOW?
GO BACK TO THE HATBOXES?

05:34.485 --> 05:36.487
NO, WE CAN NEVER GO BACK
TO THE HATBOXES.

05:36.487 --> 05:39.650
IT'S A POINT OF PRIDE.
WE HAVE MOVED BEYOND
THE HATBOX.

05:39.650 --> 05:40.691
SO, YOU‐‐

05:40.691 --> 05:42.052
YEAH, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE I PUT THEM.

05:46.857 --> 05:48.899
WOW, YOU REALLY WERE
TALKING ABOUT CANDLES.

05:48.899 --> 05:50.301
I WAS SURE IT WAS CODE
FOR SOMETHING GOOD.

05:50.301 --> 05:52.222
I LOVE HOMEMADE CANDLES.

05:52.222 --> 05:54.425
THEY ARE SO HARD
TO FIND SOMETIMES.

05:54.425 --> 05:56.226
I MEAN, TRULY HOMEMADE.

05:56.226 --> 05:58.068
( inhales )
PICK. WHICH ONE?

05:58.068 --> 06:00.551
ARE WE GOING FOR SAD AND UGLY
OR JUST POORLY‐MADE?

06:00.551 --> 06:02.553
THESE ARE FANTASTIC.
I WANT THEM ALL.

06:02.553 --> 06:04.555
WOW, THEY SMELL BAD TOO‐‐
EXCELLENT.

06:04.555 --> 06:06.477
YOU ARE AN ARTISAN!

06:06.477 --> 06:08.278
THANK YOU.

06:08.278 --> 06:09.560
FIND ONE THAT MATCHES.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.882
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

06:11.882 --> 06:13.684
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE
DECORATED HER HOUSE

06:13.684 --> 06:15.686
WITH DOZENS OF
CHIANTI BOTTLES

06:15.686 --> 06:17.888
<i>WITH CANDLES</i>
<i>IN VARIOUS STAGES</i>
<i>OF MELTING.</i>

06:17.888 --> 06:19.970
<i>I ALWAYS THOUGHT</i>
<i>THAT WAS SO ROMANTIC</i>

06:19.970 --> 06:21.772
‐ AS A THEME.
‐ UH, FANNY?

06:21.772 --> 06:24.775
I KNOW. YOU THINK
I HAVE A LOT OF THEMES
GOING ON IN MY HOUSE,

06:24.775 --> 06:26.617
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
MY HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

06:26.617 --> 06:28.859
‐ I THINK WE'RE ON
OUR LAND.
‐ WHAT?

06:28.859 --> 06:30.100
THIS IS OUR LAND.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.102
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
OUR LAND IS OVER...

06:33.304 --> 06:34.745
‐ HERE.
‐ YEAH.

06:34.745 --> 06:35.946
‐ 'CAUSE THAT'S THE‐‐
‐ THE TREE WITH THE‐‐

06:35.946 --> 06:37.628
‐ AND OVER THERE IS THE‐‐
‐ THE BARN WITH THE‐‐

06:37.628 --> 06:39.630
‐ SO THAT MEANS THAT‐‐
‐ THIS IS OUR PROPERTY.

06:41.392 --> 06:43.314
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING ON OUR PROPERTY?

06:43.314 --> 06:44.515
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:44.515 --> 06:46.557
I RENT THIS FROM
THE ALPACA GUY.

06:46.557 --> 06:47.878
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE PAYING RENT?

06:47.878 --> 06:49.480
HE JUST RAISED ME 5%.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.681
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THREE,

06:50.681 --> 06:52.883
BUT YOU KNOW
THOSE ALPACA GUYS.

06:52.883 --> 06:54.965
EXACTLY HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN RENTING THIS LAND?

06:54.965 --> 06:58.489
OH, BOY, I DON'T KNOW.
10 YEARS?

06:58.489 --> 06:59.930
10 YEARS!
FANNY.

06:59.930 --> 07:01.772
‐ I HEARD.
‐ NOT ONLY ARE NOT
MAKING ANY MONEY

07:01.772 --> 07:04.214
OFF OF OUR LAND,
BUT APPARENTLY THE
CREEPY HIPPIES ARE!

07:04.214 --> 07:05.616
HOW DID YOU
NOW KNOW THIS?

07:05.616 --> 07:06.857
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:06.857 --> 07:09.300
IT'S NOT LIKE I WALK AROUND
EVERY INCH OF MY LAND

07:09.300 --> 07:11.902
EVERY DAY WITH MY HOUNDS,
LIKE "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."

07:11.902 --> 07:13.504
ERIC THE DULL ACCOUNTANT
WAS RIGHT.

07:13.504 --> 07:15.706
WE HAVE LAND AND WE'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING WITH IT.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.628
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE HAVE A CANDLE STAND.

07:17.628 --> 07:20.471
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
WE GOTTA MAKE MONEY
OFF THIS PLACE.

07:20.471 --> 07:22.272
‐ BY DOING WHAT?
‐ I DON'T KNOW.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.955
IT'S GOT GRASS AND TREES.
WHAT ABOUT PICNICS?

07:24.955 --> 07:26.116
PICNICS?

07:26.116 --> 07:27.958
WE SHOULD GO INTO
THE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS

07:27.958 --> 07:29.360
OF PEOPLE BRINGING
THEIR OWN FOOD

07:29.360 --> 07:30.521
AND EATING IT
ON OUR LAWN?

07:30.521 --> 07:31.922
FINE, FORGET THE PICNICS.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.325
WHAT ABOUT A THEATER?

07:34.325 --> 07:36.286
OR AN OUTDOOR AMPHITHEATER
KINDA THING?

07:36.286 --> 07:37.648
‐ AN AMPHITHEATER?
‐ <i>YEAH.</i>

07:37.648 --> 07:39.009
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING

07:39.009 --> 07:40.451
FOR SPOTS TO RENT
FOR OUR PERFORMANCES.

07:40.451 --> 07:41.772
WHY SHOULD WE PAY
OTHER PEOPLE FOR THAT?

07:41.772 --> 07:43.774
‐ WE COULD DO THEM HERE.
‐ IT WILL GIVE THE PICNICKERS

07:43.774 --> 07:45.336
SOMETHING TO WATCH
WHILE THEY EAT.

07:45.336 --> 07:46.937
NO, I MEAN IT.
WE COULD ALSO RENT IT OUT

07:46.937 --> 07:48.098
FOR OTHER THINGS.

07:48.098 --> 07:49.900
WEDDINGS WOULD BE
REALLY PRETTY HERE.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.863
‐ TRUE.
‐ <i>BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATION PARTIES,</i>

07:52.863 --> 07:55.065
SCHOOL FUNCTIONS,
COMMUNITY THEATER!

07:55.065 --> 07:57.067
‐ LIKE THE DELACORTE.
‐ EXACTLY!

07:57.067 --> 07:58.669
A LOW‐RENT
DELACORTE THEATER.

07:58.669 --> 07:59.990
AND I'M JOSEPH PAPP.

07:59.990 --> 08:02.833
ABSOLUTELY.
A LOW‐RENT JOSEPH PAPP.

08:02.833 --> 08:06.397
WE COULD BOOK ROAD COMPANIES,
TOURING GROUPS, ROCK BANDS!

08:06.397 --> 08:08.799
"ACE FREHLEY'S NEPHEWS
PLAY THE MUSIC OF KISS."

08:08.799 --> 08:10.761
‐ THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.
‐ IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

08:12.603 --> 08:15.486
HEY. YOU HAVE
TO PAY FOR THOSE.

08:15.486 --> 08:17.848
OH! SORRY.

08:17.848 --> 08:19.690
‐ HOW MUCH?
‐ <i>WELL‐‐</i>

08:19.690 --> 08:22.493
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU'RE ON MY PROPERTY...

08:22.493 --> 08:25.896
ILLEGALLY, AND YOU HAVE
BEEN FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.538
THESE ARE FOR RENT.

08:27.538 --> 08:28.859
AND THIS IS FOR RENT.

08:28.859 --> 08:31.502
AND THIS‐‐
THEY'RE ALL FOR RENT.

08:34.184 --> 08:35.986
‐ AH, SO PRETTY.
‐ MM.

08:42.192 --> 08:43.514
‐ <i>( knocks on door )</i>
‐ DUDE! I'VE BEEN DOWNSTAIRS
FOR A YEAR

08:43.514 --> 08:45.115
‐ WAITING FOR
YOUR PATHETIC ASS.
‐ <i>( sad music playing )</i>

08:45.115 --> 08:46.357
( sighing ) SO?

08:46.357 --> 08:49.400
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS;
YOU NEED TO DRIVE ME.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.201
YOU... DRIVE ME...

08:51.201 --> 08:52.403
IS TIME.

08:52.403 --> 08:54.004
MORON NO SPEAK ANYMORE?

08:54.004 --> 08:56.246
GET UP!

08:56.246 --> 08:58.008
‐ ( groans )
‐ <i>( music stops )</i>

08:58.008 --> 09:00.210
‐ HEY!
‐ I'M SORRY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LISTEN TO

09:00.210 --> 09:03.253
"VAMPIRE DOESN'T
SPARKLE ANYMORE" MUSIC
AFTER YOU DRIVE ME TO CLASS.

09:04.775 --> 09:08.459
LET'S GO!
I'M GONNA BE LATE!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:08.459 --> 09:10.220
‐ I'M SICK.
‐ AND UGLY.

09:10.220 --> 09:12.383
NEVER HAS STOPPED YOU
FROM DRIVING BEFORE.

09:15.546 --> 09:17.948
‐ WHAT'S THIS?
‐ GO.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.391
‐ YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE
YOUR CAR?
‐ YUP.

09:20.391 --> 09:22.953
‐ YOU'RE GONNA LET ME
DRIVE YOUR CAR?
‐ SURE.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.274
EVEN THOUGH
I'M A TERRIBLE DRIVER?

09:24.274 --> 09:27.037
AND I DON'T HAVE
A LICENSE?

09:27.037 --> 09:28.479
AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
IN "ANNIE HALL"

09:28.479 --> 09:29.720
IS MY VEHICULAR ROLE MODEL?

09:31.241 --> 09:32.403
<i>CHARLIE!</i>

09:33.964 --> 09:34.965
( groans )

09:36.927 --> 09:38.369
IT'S SO WEIRD.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.930
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.293
SITTING NEXT TO THE GUY WHO
DRESSES LIKE CHEWBACCA
EVERY WEEKEND.

09:42.293 --> 09:44.415
AND HE'S WEARING
HIS LETTERMAN JACKET.

09:44.415 --> 09:46.297
‐ WELL, IT WAS
CHILLY THAT DAY.
‐ I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:46.297 --> 09:48.379
DIDN'T THEIR RELATIONSHIP
USED TO REVOLVE AROUND

09:48.379 --> 09:50.381
ONE OF THEM STUFFING
THE OTHER INTO A LOCKER?

09:50.381 --> 09:51.742
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
THE HIGH SCHOOL U. N.,

09:51.742 --> 09:53.143
BRINGING TOGETHER
ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE

09:53.143 --> 09:54.625
WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN
TOGETHER BEFORE.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.226
AND REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE TOGETHER NOW.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.228
‐ FRANKIE AND COZETTE?
‐ WHO ELSE?

09:58.228 --> 10:00.631
THAT KID GRADUATED
TWO YEARS AGO.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.633
I'M SORRY, THERE ARE
CLIQUES AND GROUPS
FOR A REASON.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.435
FIRST OF ALL, IF EVERYONE
GOT ALONG WITH EVERYONE,

10:04.435 --> 10:06.236
THERE WOULD NEVER BE
A DECENT BOOK WRITTEN,

10:06.236 --> 10:07.838
‐ A DECENT MOVIE MADE.
‐ JOHN HUGHES?

10:07.838 --> 10:09.239
WOULD HAVE WORKED
AT BED BATH & BEYOND.

10:09.239 --> 10:11.482
NO "ON THE ROAD,"
NO "CATCHER IN THE RYE."

10:11.482 --> 10:14.204
SEPARATION BREEDS DISCONTENT,
WHICH FUELS SOCIETY.

10:14.204 --> 10:16.006
THEY ARE DEFUELING SOCIETY.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.008
MESSING WITH THE SOCIAL
ECOSYSTEM OF THE SCHOOL.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.411
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S BRINGING BACK YELLOW,
AND I LOOK TERRIBLE IN YELLOW.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.454
HE WAS A FRENCH ARTIST.
BORN AROUND 1869.

10:23.454 --> 10:26.216
‐ REALLY?
‐ OH, MATISSE, AMAZING.

10:26.216 --> 10:28.218
"THE DANCE,"
I SAW IT AT MOMA.

10:28.218 --> 10:29.420
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN NAMED
AFTER HIM.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.821
HMM, I NEVER KNEW.

10:30.821 --> 10:33.063
I JUST THOUGHT MY PARENTS
MISSPELLED "MELISSA."

10:33.063 --> 10:34.224
THEY'RE NOT INTO DETAILS.

10:34.224 --> 10:36.427
( quietly )
SHE'S GOT MATISSE.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.988
IT'S AN AMAZING NAME.

10:37.988 --> 10:39.990
AMAZING ARTIST.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.912
‐ HIS GRANDSON
WAS MY GODFATHER.
‐ REALLY?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.994
I HAVE A TWO‐VOLUME BIOGRAPHY
I CAN LOAN YOU.

10:43.994 --> 10:46.997
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT BACK, THOUGH.
IT'S GOT JULIAN SCHNABEL'S
NOTES IN THE MARGIN.

10:46.997 --> 10:49.440
WOW.
WHO'S JULIAN SCHNABELS?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.001
( chuckles )

10:51.001 --> 10:52.443
OH, MATISSE.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.566
I SAY, AFTER CLASS,
WE CHECK THE TOWN
FOR PODS.

10:55.566 --> 10:58.329
THAT'S OUR BUS DRIVER.

10:58.329 --> 11:00.771
Fanny:
<i>TRULY? TRULY?</i>
<i>OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.</i>

11:00.771 --> 11:02.333
‐ <i>( classical music playing )</i>
‐ TRULY?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.974
YES.

11:03.974 --> 11:05.296
GET OVER HERE.

11:05.296 --> 11:07.298
UHH, OKAY.

11:07.298 --> 11:08.939
UH, HOLD ON.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.469
WHEN I SAID YOU COULD USE
A CORNER OF THE STUDIO

11:18.469 --> 11:20.871
TEMPORARILY FOR YOUR STORE,
I MEANT A CORNER,

11:20.871 --> 11:23.314
NOT THE WHOLE PLACE.
I NEED MY DANCE FLOOR BACK.

11:23.314 --> 11:25.155
I KNOW, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHERE EVERYTHING GOES.

11:25.155 --> 11:26.236
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OF IT.

11:26.236 --> 11:28.479
I DON'T CARE.
I HAVE A CLASS TO TEACH.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.841
THESE CHILDREN HAVE COME HERE
TO LEARN TO DANCE.

11:30.841 --> 11:33.243
STOP SHOPPING!
THIS ISN'T A MALL!

11:33.243 --> 11:35.045
‐ YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES.
‐ ( inhales sharply )

11:35.045 --> 11:37.247
I DON'T DO WELL
UNDER PRESSURE.

11:37.247 --> 11:40.290
WHEN I WAS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE,
I HAD TO DEBATE GUN CONTROL

11:40.290 --> 11:42.493
AND I MEMORIZED
ALL THE STATISTICS
AND THE TALKING POINTS,

11:42.493 --> 11:44.695
AND I EVEN HAD VISUAL AIDS,
BUT WHEN IT GOT TO MY TURN,

11:44.695 --> 11:46.417
I KEPT SAYING "GUM CONTROL."

11:46.417 --> 11:47.578
THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.

11:47.578 --> 11:48.899
I WON, THOUGH.
THE OTHER DEBATER

11:48.899 --> 11:50.541
GOT SO CONFUSED,
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.304
GET EVERYTHING OFF
MY FLOOR PLEASE.

11:53.304 --> 11:54.905
<i>( door closes )</i>

11:54.905 --> 11:57.308
OH, FANNY, LEAVE IT.
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK, RIGHT?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.221
SHE GOT THE STUDIO.

13:12.903 --> 13:16.106
I FOUND IT.
THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR THE AMPHITHEATER.

13:16.106 --> 13:18.268
OKAY, SO THIS MORNING,
A SQUIRREL STOLE
MY TOOTHBRUSH.

13:18.268 --> 13:20.911
ACTUALLY, I CHUCKED IT
AT HIM TO GET HIM OFF
MY WINDOWSILL

13:20.911 --> 13:22.272
'CAUSE HE WAS STARING
AT ME, AND THEN
HE TOOK IT.

13:22.272 --> 13:24.915
SO I CHASED AFTER HIM
AND I CORNERED HIM
AGAINST THIS TREE.

13:24.915 --> 13:27.318
AND IT WAS BY THE LAKE
THAT'S ONLY SOMETIMES
A LAKE,

13:27.318 --> 13:29.320
BUT THEN IT DRIES UP.
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S
A LAKE AGAIN.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.282
‐ YOU KNOW?
‐ YOU CAN'T JUST BUY
ANOTHER TOOTHBRUSH?

13:32.282 --> 13:33.484
WHAT?

13:33.484 --> 13:35.926
SQUIRRELS HAVE RABIES.
A TOOTHBRUSH COSTS $3.

13:35.926 --> 13:38.329
‐ IT WAS PINK.
‐ OH, WELL, IF IT WAS PINK‐‐

13:38.329 --> 13:41.332
ANYHOW, IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT.
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

13:41.332 --> 13:43.294
THE ONLY THING
I HAVE TO SEE
IS MY DANCE FLOOR.

13:43.294 --> 13:44.254
HELP ME.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.058
YOU HEARD HER.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.066
‐ SO...
‐ SO.

13:56.066 --> 13:58.228
‐ WE'VE GOT NEWS.
‐ AND ARMS AND LEGS. PUSH.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.670
‐ GUESS WHO'S BACK?
‐ WHO?

13:59.670 --> 14:01.271
‐ GUESS.
‐ GIVE ME A HINT.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.354
HE'S TALL AND CUTE
AND SURFS,

14:03.354 --> 14:05.075
AND YOU MADE
A COMPLETE IDIOT
OUT OF YOURSELF

14:05.075 --> 14:06.357
WITH HIM IN FRONT
OF THE ENTIRE TOWN.

14:06.357 --> 14:07.758
‐ GIVE ME ANOTHER HINT.
‐ GODOT.

14:07.758 --> 14:09.760
‐ JUST FLEW IN FROM AUSTRALIA
‐ BOO TOLD US.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.322
‐ OH, YEAH?
‐ YEAH.

14:11.322 --> 14:14.325
WAIT, YOU MEAN
THE SOMETIMES‐LAKE
ON THE FAR SIDE

14:14.325 --> 14:16.367
OF THE HERB GARDEN
WITH THE TREE THAT
LOOKS LIKE‐‐

14:16.367 --> 14:17.968
BILBO'S HOUSE
IN THE SHIRE? YES.

14:17.968 --> 14:20.331
‐ THAT IS PERFECT!
‐ <i>( glass shatters )</i>

14:20.331 --> 14:24.134
TRULY?
OH MY GOD.
WHAT A MESS.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.136
<i>WELL, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.</i>
<i>EVERYTHING'S ALL OVER</i>
<i>THE PLACE.</i>

14:26.136 --> 14:27.338
‐ SO?
‐ SO?

14:27.338 --> 14:28.739
‐ SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
‐ ABOUT WHAT?

14:28.739 --> 14:30.341
‐ ABOUT GODOT.
‐ WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:30.341 --> 14:32.343
PUT ON A SLUTTY DRESS
AND GET DOWN THERE.

14:32.343 --> 14:34.345
‐ I'LL TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION.
‐ THAT'S IT?

14:34.345 --> 14:37.508
‐ DON'T YOU CARE?
‐ THAT GODOT'S BACK? NO.

14:37.508 --> 14:41.151
ALTHOUGH, I DO THINK IT'S NICE
THAT HE DIDN'T EAT THE WRONG
BERRY AND STARVE TO DEATH

14:41.151 --> 14:43.354
IN A VAN IN THE WOODS.
BUT AT THE MOMENT
I'M SUPER BUSY.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.677
HOW'D HE LOOK?

14:48.479 --> 14:51.081
GET YOUR BACKS INTO IT.
TRULY?

14:51.081 --> 14:52.883
UH.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.327
YEAH, I'M STUCK.

14:56.327 --> 14:58.729
WELL, GET UNSTUCK.

14:58.729 --> 15:00.691
I GOT IT, FANNY.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.212
( whistles )

15:07.858 --> 15:09.420
AND THEY KNOW
SIGN LANGUAGE.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.061
OF COURSE THEY DO.

15:11.061 --> 15:13.263
THEY'RE LIKE TWO
REALLY HOT UNICORNS.

15:13.263 --> 15:15.866
YOU ARE A TALENTED TWOSOME,
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER.

15:15.866 --> 15:17.628
YOUR FAMILY IS VERY LUCKY.

15:20.791 --> 15:22.553
SHE GOT MADAME FANNY.

15:27.358 --> 15:28.599
YES, I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT THE MOBILE HOME,

15:28.599 --> 15:30.401
BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD
THE MOBILE HOME

15:30.401 --> 15:32.923
UNLESS YOU INTEND FOR IT
TO BE YOUR ACTUAL HOME.

15:32.923 --> 15:34.885
<i>UNDERSTAND?</i>

15:34.885 --> 15:36.887
OKAY, FROM THE TOP.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.530
YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE
IS ZERO. NOW THE‐‐

15:39.530 --> 15:40.931
GET OUT THE GOLD STARS.

15:40.931 --> 15:42.132
WE HAVE COME UP
WITH A PLAN.

15:42.132 --> 15:43.374
A GREAT PLAN.

15:43.374 --> 15:44.895
EXCUSE ME,
BUT I'M WITH CLIENTS.

15:44.895 --> 15:46.297
OH, SORRY.
WE'RE JUST EXCITED

15:46.297 --> 15:47.658
AND WANTED TO RUN
OUR GREAT IDEA PAST YOU,

15:47.658 --> 15:49.460
OUR MONEY GURU!
HE'S VERY GOOD.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.461
CAN YOU TWO JUST WAIT?

15:50.461 --> 15:51.742
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD
AN AMPHITHEATER!

15:51.742 --> 15:52.903
<i>I'M SORRY.</i>

15:52.903 --> 15:54.064
DID YOU ASK ME TO
TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS?

15:54.064 --> 15:56.347
‐ NO.
‐ IT'S AN AMPHITHEATER!

15:56.347 --> 15:58.549
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING OUTSIDE
FOR JUST A MOMENT?

15:58.549 --> 16:01.151
‐ IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
‐ WE TALK FAST.

16:01.151 --> 16:03.233
WE'RE NOT THINKING
ANYTHING TOO FANCY‐‐

16:03.233 --> 16:05.115
A STAGE, SOME BENCHES,
LIGHTING.

16:05.115 --> 16:06.437
WE'LL CHARGE FOR PARKING.

16:06.437 --> 16:08.399
PARKING ALWAYS SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A RACKET TO ME,

16:08.399 --> 16:10.841
‐ BUT NOW‐‐
‐ WE'D LIKE TO HAVE IT
UP AND RUNNING

16:10.841 --> 16:12.843
FOR OUR "SLEEPING BEAUTY,"
SO THAT'S...

16:12.843 --> 16:15.045
‐ A MONTH, REALLY.
‐ THREE WEEKS WOULD BE BETTER.

16:15.045 --> 16:16.367
LET'S MAKE IT
THREE WEEKS THEN.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.568
AN AMPHITHEATER?

16:17.568 --> 16:19.410
WITH A LITTLE MORE
ENTHUSIASM, ERIC!

16:19.410 --> 16:20.891
HOW ARE YOU PAYING FOR IT?

16:20.891 --> 16:22.493
WE PLAN TO PAY
WITH MONEY.

16:22.493 --> 16:23.654
UNLESS YOU KNOW
ANOTHER WAY.

16:23.654 --> 16:24.975
WE ARE OPEN
TO ANYTHING.

16:24.975 --> 16:26.577
AND HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET THIS MONEY?

16:26.577 --> 16:28.258
WE'LL JUST GET ONE
OF THOSE LOAN‐Y THINGIES.

16:28.258 --> 16:31.101
UH‐HUH. WELL, THOSE
"LOAN‐Y THINGIES"
ARE HARD TO GET.

16:31.101 --> 16:33.464
HEY, THEY JUST OPENED
A SECOND "HEADBAND HUT"
DOWNTOWN,

16:33.464 --> 16:34.865
SO CLEARLY BANKS ARE
GIVING MONEY AWAY.

16:34.865 --> 16:37.067
YOU NEED COLLATERAL
TO GET A LOAN‐Y THINGIE.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.069
YOU NEED GOOD CREDIT
TO GET A LOAN‐Y THINGIE.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.352
YOU NEED A BUSINESS PLAN
TO GET A LOAN‐Y THINGIE.

16:41.352 --> 16:43.954
NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
SAYING "LOAN‐Y THINGIE."

16:43.954 --> 16:46.357
THEY ARE LOANS,
AND LOANS ARE FOR PEOPLE

16:46.357 --> 16:48.359
WHO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT
BATHROOM FACILITIES,

16:48.359 --> 16:49.960
GETTING PERMITS,
ZONING LAWS.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.722
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
ALL THOSE THINGS?

16:51.722 --> 16:53.964
‐ MICHELLE...
‐ WELL, HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

16:53.964 --> 16:56.246
UNTIL YOU JUST
GAVE HIM CONFIRMATION.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.409
LOOK! JUDY, MICKEY,
YOU CAN'T JUST GET AN IDEA

16:58.409 --> 17:00.250
AND PUT ON A SHOW
IN THE BARN.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.693
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
TELLING YOU THIS OVER AND OVER,

17:02.693 --> 17:05.576
AND IT'S JUST NOT
GETTING THROUGH.

17:05.576 --> 17:07.738
NOW I'M GOING TO GO OUT
AND DEAL WITH MY OTHER CLIENTS.

17:07.738 --> 17:09.700
AND YOU TWO
ARE GOING TO LEAVE.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.462
DO NOT STEAL
MY PENS THIS TIME.

17:16.707 --> 17:18.148
OKAY, I WANNA
FIRE HIM AGAIN.

17:18.148 --> 17:19.350
I DON'T THINK WE FIRED HIM
THE FIRST TIME.

17:19.350 --> 17:20.911
HE SHOULD BE HELPING US.

17:20.911 --> 17:23.914
SO WHAT IF WE HAVEN'T
THOUGHT EVERY SINGLE
LAST DETAIL OUT?

17:23.914 --> 17:26.116
SEE, THIS IS WHY
AMERICAN INGENUITY IS DYING.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.118
NO ONE IS ENCOURAGING US
TO DREAM ANYMORE.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.481
I DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR
THE "JUDY AND MICKEY"
COMMENT EITHER.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.483
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT, RIGHT?

17:32.483 --> 17:33.684
I MEAN, WE KNOW
THIS BUSINESS.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.125
‐ IT'S OUR BUSINESS.
‐ TRUE.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.127
WE JUST NEED HELP
ON THE NUMBERS END.

17:37.127 --> 17:39.490
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LUCKY LUCIANO
AND I'M BUGSY SIEGEL,

17:39.490 --> 17:40.891
AND WE JUST NEED
A MEYER LANSKY.

17:40.891 --> 17:41.892
WHO'S OUR MEYER LANSKY?

17:41.892 --> 17:43.454
HE'S OUR MEYER LANSKY.

17:43.454 --> 17:45.456
NO, WE NEED A BEN KINGSLEY
MEYER LANSKY,

17:45.456 --> 17:46.857
NOT A PATRICK DEMPSEY
MEYER LANSKY.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.579
A REAL MEYER LANSKY.

17:48.579 --> 17:49.900
PLEASE STOP SAYING
"MEYER LANSKY."

17:49.900 --> 17:51.101
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW IT.

17:51.101 --> 17:52.503
I'LL BE OUR MEYER LANSKY.

17:52.503 --> 17:54.104
YOU WANNA LEARN BALLET,
YOU TAKE A BALLET CLASS.

17:54.104 --> 17:55.626
YOU WANNA LEARN BUSINESS,
YOU TAKE A BUSINESS CLASS.

17:55.626 --> 17:57.628
‐ WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
‐ I'M GONNA TAKE
A BUSINESS CLASS.

17:57.628 --> 17:59.590
LET'S GO MAKE UP WITH ERIC.

17:59.590 --> 18:01.472
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
STRINGER BELL DID IT, RIGHT?

18:01.472 --> 18:03.554
EVERY TIME WE HAVE
A CONVERSATION, I FEEL LIKE

18:03.554 --> 18:05.356
I NEED TO ADD
MORE MOVIE CHANNELS.

18:05.356 --> 18:07.518
NO, I CAN DO THIS.
I'LL JUST HIT A LEARNING ANNEX

18:07.518 --> 18:09.360
‐ OR SOME BABY COLLEGE.
‐ JUNIOR COLLEGE.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.161
I'LL LEARN HOW TO RUN
THE BUSINESS END,

18:11.161 --> 18:13.924
THEN WE'LL NEVER HAVE
TO COME BACK HERE AND
FIRE THIS GUY AGAIN.

18:13.924 --> 18:15.406
YOU'RE SURE?

18:15.406 --> 18:16.447
I'M SURE.

18:16.447 --> 18:17.528
ALL RIGHT!

18:17.528 --> 18:18.529
LET'S DO IT!

18:27.217 --> 18:28.579
‐ HEY, MISSING LINK‐‐
‐ SHH.

18:28.579 --> 18:30.060
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A GAME.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.422
‐ LOOK, I JUST WANNA
ASK YOU ONE‐‐
‐ GOD!

18:31.422 --> 18:33.624
‐ YOU DISTRACTED ME!
‐ IT'S PAPER FOOTBALL.

18:33.624 --> 18:35.386
YEAH, TO YOU.

18:35.386 --> 18:37.027
HE GETS
A FIELD GOAL NOW.

18:38.108 --> 18:40.110
( scoffs )
SHANKED IT.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.432
COUNT YOURSELF LUCKY.

18:41.432 --> 18:43.434
I'M TERRIFIED
OF YOUR MORON WRATH.

18:43.434 --> 18:44.715
SO WHAT'S UP WITH CHARLIE?

18:44.715 --> 18:46.357
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
‐ HE SAYS HE'S SICK.

18:46.357 --> 18:49.560
‐ HE'S NOT SICK.
‐ I KNOW HE'S NOT SICK.
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.442
BOOM! TAKE IT
LIKE A MAN, SON!

18:51.442 --> 18:52.563
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN!

18:52.563 --> 18:54.725
HEY, WOO YOUR PRISON WIFE
LATER, OKAY?

18:54.725 --> 18:56.086
CHARLIE‐‐ WHAT'S THE DEAL?

18:56.086 --> 18:57.448
( scoffs )
ASK HIM YOURSELF.

18:57.448 --> 18:59.570
I SAW HIM GET KICKED
TO THE CURB BY STACIA.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.372
YOU AND THE REST
OF THE PLANET.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.093
‐ SO WHAT'D HE DO?
‐ WHAT?

19:03.093 --> 19:05.456
WHAT DID HE DO
TO MAKE HER DUMP HIM?

19:05.456 --> 19:07.217
TREAT HER LIKE CRAP?
DIDN'T CALL?

19:07.217 --> 19:09.620
MADE HER PAY FOR GAS?
TOOK HER TO THE MOVIES
AND REENACTED "DINER"?

19:09.620 --> 19:13.464
YES! NOW HOLD THOSE
GOAL POSTS UNIFORM
THIS TIME, DOUCHE.

19:15.386 --> 19:16.507
CRAP! YOU MOVED.

19:16.507 --> 19:18.549
‐ I DID NOT.
‐ YOU SUCK.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.272
‐ YOU GONNA KISS ME?
‐ HE CHEATED ON HER, RIGHT?

19:22.272 --> 19:25.075
FINALLY GOT THAT
PHONE COVER KIOSK BIMBO
TO GO OUT WITH HIM?

19:25.075 --> 19:26.477
HE DIDN'T CHEAT ON HER.

19:26.477 --> 19:28.559
WELL, WHAT THEN?
WHAT BONEHEADED THING DID HE DO?

19:28.559 --> 19:31.402
NOTHIN'.
HE WAS TOTALLY SMITTEN,

19:31.402 --> 19:33.203
TALKING ABOUT
GETTING HER NAME

19:33.203 --> 19:35.125
TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
AND CRAP LIKE THAT.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.647
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE WORD "SMITTEN"?

19:36.647 --> 19:39.089
HE PICKED HER UP
AFTER WORK EVERY DAY,

19:39.089 --> 19:40.651
CALLED HER ALL THE TIME,

19:40.651 --> 19:42.293
TOOK EXTRA SHIFTS
SO HE COULD BUY HER

19:42.293 --> 19:44.214
THIS LOCKET NECKLACE
FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

19:44.214 --> 19:46.777
CHARLIE? INTO SOMEONE
OTHER THAN HIMSELF?

19:46.777 --> 19:50.220
YEAH, AND THEN SHE JUST
BITCHED OUT AND DUMPED HIM,

19:50.220 --> 19:51.582
PUBLICLY.

19:51.582 --> 19:53.624
VERY UNFEELING CHICK.

19:53.624 --> 19:55.706
HE'S TAKING IT BAD,

19:55.706 --> 19:57.788
WHICH BLOWS 'CAUSE
THIS GUY'S THUMBS
ARE WAY CROOKED.

19:57.788 --> 19:59.870
OKAY.

19:59.870 --> 20:00.871
THANKS.

20:00.871 --> 20:02.873
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME.

20:02.873 --> 20:04.875
OOH, YOU GOT
SOME GOOD STUFF.

20:08.879 --> 20:09.880
<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</i>

20:09.880 --> 20:11.522
LANSKY'S IN THE HOUSE!

20:11.522 --> 20:13.524
‐ REALLY?
‐ YEP, JUST SIGNED UP

20:13.524 --> 20:16.687
FOR A FULL‐ON JUNIOR COLLEGE
COURSE IN ACCOUNTING
FOR SMALL BUSINESS.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.889
GOT MY BOOKS, MY SWEATSHIRT
AND MY NUMBER‐TWO PENCIL.

20:18.889 --> 20:21.332

20:21.332 --> 20:22.893
IS GET 'EM A COPY

20:22.893 --> 20:25.215
BUY SOME YAFFA BLOCKS
AND START EXPERIMENTING
SEXUALLY.

20:25.215 --> 20:26.897
‐ TERRIFIC.
‐ <i>YOU KNOW, I GOTTA SAY</i>

20:26.897 --> 20:28.499
NOW THAT I'M ALMOST
A BUSINESS MAJOR,

20:28.499 --> 20:30.341
I'M SEEING THINGS
WITH NEW EYES.

20:30.341 --> 20:32.062
I SEE DOLLAR SIGNS EVERYWHERE.

20:32.062 --> 20:34.465
WALKED BY THE HARDWARE STORE
THIS MORNING AND JUST
STARTED MONETIZING.

20:34.465 --> 20:36.347
‐ RIGHT THERE ON THE STREET.
‐ MONETIZING?

20:36.347 --> 20:37.908
IT'S A BUSINESS WORD.
FOR BUSINESS.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.512
WOW, QUITE A CROWD.

20:41.512 --> 20:42.873
IT'S FASCINATING.

20:42.873 --> 20:45.836
THERE'S BEEN A LINE
OF WOMEN HERE SINCE
THE MINUTE SHE OPENED.

20:45.836 --> 20:47.438
I HAD A CLASS AT 2:00.

20:47.438 --> 20:49.840
AT 2:05,
THAT WOMAN AND THAT WOMAN

20:49.840 --> 20:52.643
GOT INTO A KNOCK‐DOWN‐DRAG‐OUT
FIGHT OVER A BLOUSE

20:52.643 --> 20:56.647
THAT <i>THAT</i> WOMAN WOUND UP WITH
AFTER THEY DROPPED IT
TO EXCHANGE BLOWS.

20:56.647 --> 20:58.409
THEN THEY ALL
BOUGHT SOME PANTS.

20:58.409 --> 21:00.971
WELL, TRULY SELLS
A QUALITY PRODUCT
AT A REASONABLE PRICE.

21:00.971 --> 21:02.212
GOD, I'M A NATURAL.

21:03.334 --> 21:04.495
( whispering )
HEY.

21:04.495 --> 21:06.897
SHOULDN'T WE BE
CHARGING HER RENT?

21:06.897 --> 21:09.700
‐ ( whispering ) WHAT?
‐ WE'RE HER LANDLORDS NOW, WE
SHOULD BE CHARGING HER RENT.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.903
SHE'S JUST USING A CORNER
OF THE DANCE STUDIO WHEN
WE DON'T HAVE CLASSES.

21:12.903 --> 21:14.705
WE HAVE TO THINK
LIKE LANDLORDS.

21:14.705 --> 21:17.348
SHE'S USING OUR SPACE,
OUR ELECTRICITY, OUR BATHROOMS.

21:17.348 --> 21:20.150
‐ OH, I'M NOT LETTING THEM
USE THE BATHROOMS.
‐ WHAT?

21:20.150 --> 21:21.552
WHERE ARE THEY
GOING TO THE BATHROOM?

21:21.552 --> 21:22.593
WHY WOULD THEY HAVE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM?

21:22.593 --> 21:24.595
FANNY, EVERYONE HAS
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

21:24.595 --> 21:27.398
IT'S A CLOTHING STORE.
HOW LONG DO YOU SPEND
IN A CLOTHING STORE?

21:27.398 --> 21:29.199
I SPEND TWO, THREE HOURS
IN A CLOTHING STORE.

21:29.199 --> 21:30.961
PEOPLE CAN'T GO
TWO, THREE HOURS
WITHOUT USING

21:30.961 --> 21:33.404
‐ THE BATHROOM?
‐ WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY GOING
IF THEY'RE NOT GOING HERE?

21:33.404 --> 21:36.407
‐ DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
‐ YOU WOULDN'T GO INTO A
BOUTIQUE TO USE THE BATHROOM.

21:36.407 --> 21:37.968
I USE THE BATHROOM
AT BLOOMINGDALE'S.

21:37.968 --> 21:40.210
THAT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
IT'S A HUGE STORE.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.213
THIS IS A TINY BOUTIQUE.
YOU USE THE BATHROOM
IN A TINY BOUTIQUE,

21:43.213 --> 21:44.975
EVERYBODY KNOWS.
THEY'RE LISTENING.

21:44.975 --> 21:46.377
WHAT IF YOU HAD
BAD TACOS FOR LUNCH?

21:46.377 --> 21:48.419
THEN YOU DON'T
GO SHOPPING.

21:48.419 --> 21:50.421
<i>( cellphone rings )</i>

21:51.702 --> 21:53.904
( normal voice ) HELLO?
YES, THIS IS MICHELLE.

21:55.866 --> 21:56.867
WHAT?

21:58.589 --> 22:00.391
NO. NO NO NO NO NO,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

22:00.391 --> 22:02.192
CAN YOU CHECK AGAIN?

22:02.192 --> 22:04.835
YES, OF COURSE I'M SURE.

22:04.835 --> 22:08.198
BUT I'M‐‐ I'M SORRY,
YOU MUST BE MAKING A MISTAKE.

22:08.198 --> 22:12.403
I‐‐ I WAS AT THE CEREMONY.
I WALKED DOWN THE AISLE.
I DID THE TASSEL THING.

22:12.403 --> 22:14.365
NO, I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY.

22:14.365 --> 22:16.967
JUDY KEELER AND I DECIDED
TO WEAR BIKINIS
UNDER OUR ROBES.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.769
AND THE ROBES ONLY HAD
ONE BUTTON AT THE VERY TOP,

22:18.769 --> 22:21.972
AND IT WAS A REALLY WINDY DAY
AND THE WIND BLEW THE ROBES UP.

22:21.972 --> 22:24.415
LOOK, SOMEBODY THERE HAS
GOTTA REMEMBER THE BIKINIS.

22:24.415 --> 22:25.776
CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK AGAIN?

22:29.500 --> 22:31.502
OKAY. THANKS.

22:38.989 --> 22:41.231
I THINK I FORGOT
TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.

22:41.231 --> 22:43.434
WHAT?
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

22:43.434 --> 22:46.477
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE SAYING
I WAS ONE COURSE SHORT,

22:46.477 --> 22:47.638
AND I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL,

22:47.638 --> 22:49.640
BUT I DON'T THINK
I EVER DID GO TO
SUMMER SCHOOL.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.402
I THINK I WENT
TO DOLLYWOOD.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.963
OH MY GOD, THAT'S RIGHT.
I WENT TO DOLLYWOOD.

22:52.963 --> 22:55.406
AND I WAS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO STAY THERE FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS,

22:55.406 --> 22:57.568
BUT I THINK SOMEHOW
WE WERE THERE A COUPLE WEEKS.

22:57.568 --> 23:00.170
HOW COULD YOU STAY
IN DOLLYWOOD FOR TWO WEEKS?

23:00.170 --> 23:04.094
WELL, THE CORN'S REALLY GOOD
AND THE SINGING KINSMEN ARE
ALL ACTUALLY DOLLY'S KIN.

23:04.094 --> 23:07.097
‐ MICHELLE!
‐ AH, THEN I JUST FORGOT.

23:07.097 --> 23:09.700
I FORGOT TO FINISH SCHOOL.
I'M A DROPOUT‐‐

23:09.700 --> 23:12.343
NOT EVEN A DROPOUT.
DROPPING OUT IMPLIES ACTION.

23:12.343 --> 23:15.506
I JUST DIDN'T FINISH.

23:15.506 --> 23:17.508
OH GOD, I'M THE BIGGEST
LOSER IN THE WORLD.

23:17.508 --> 23:21.111
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
MY MEYER LANSKY DOESN'T
HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

23:22.993 --> 23:25.235
I'M GOING TO CALL ERIC.
WHERE ARE HIS PENS?

23:25.235 --> 23:26.597
‐ IN MY PURSE.
‐ WHERE'S YOUR PURSE?

23:26.597 --> 23:29.480
‐ I FORGOT.
‐ ( scoffs )

23:29.480 --> 23:32.282
‐ MY DAD AND FAYE MENDELSON
SET THE WEDDING LOCATION.
‐ FUN.

23:32.282 --> 23:34.445
‐ IT'S THE SAME PLACE
HE MARRIED MY MOM.
‐ NO WAY.

23:34.445 --> 23:38.288
IT IS ON THE SAME DAY.
IT IS AT THE SAME TIME.
IT IS UNDER THE SAME TREE

23:38.288 --> 23:41.292
THAT HE MARRIED MY MOM UNDER.
SHE HIRED THE SAME BAND,
THE SAME PHOTOGRAPHER.

23:41.292 --> 23:44.054
SHE FORCED THE SAME BAKER
TO COME OUT OF RETIREMENT
TO MAKE THE SAME CAKE.

23:44.054 --> 23:45.656
‐ SHE'S INSANE.
‐ YEP.

23:45.656 --> 23:47.658
MY DAD TRADED IN
ONE CRAZY REDHEAD
FOR ANOTHER.

23:47.658 --> 23:49.460
FAYE MENDELSON
IS MY MOTHER 2.0.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.862
‐ HOW'S YOUR MOM TAKING IT?
‐ SHE'S BASICALLY HOMICIDAL.

23:51.862 --> 23:54.465
THE ONLY SHOWS SHE'LL
WATCH ON TV ARE SHOWS
WITH "CRIME" IN THE TITLE‐‐

23:54.465 --> 23:57.668
"CRIMINAL MINDS,"
"CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION,"
"LADIES WHO CRIME"‐‐

23:57.668 --> 24:00.070
AND SHE'S TAKING
COPIOUS NOTES.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.753
I FIGURE, ON THE PLUS SIDE,
MY MEMOIRS WILL BE EXCELLENT.

24:02.753 --> 24:05.396
ON THE DOWNSIDE,
I'LL PROBABLY END UP
MEDICATED IN A BATHROBE.

24:05.396 --> 24:06.397
AND ONCE A MONTH
WHEN YOU‐‐

24:06.397 --> 24:08.559
‐ ( Ginny gasps )
‐ All: OH!

24:08.559 --> 24:10.160
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

24:10.160 --> 24:11.762
‐ I DON'T KNOW.
‐ WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

24:11.762 --> 24:13.163
‐ I DON'T KNOW.
‐ SHOULD BE GO BACK?

24:13.163 --> 24:14.405
NO.

24:23.574 --> 24:25.015
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE FANCY DOODADS?

24:25.015 --> 24:28.459
IT IS TRIVIA NIGHT
AND I HAVE A SYSTEM
THAT WORKS.

24:28.459 --> 24:29.700
AND THIS IS MY SYSTEM
THAT WORKS.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.542
‐ I LIKE YOUR LITTLE‐‐
‐ DON'T TOUCH THE TROLL.

24:31.542 --> 24:33.904
HE'S MY LUCKY TROLL
AND YOU ARE NOT‐‐

24:33.904 --> 24:38.188
‐ LUCKY?
‐ OR... IN HIS TRUST CIRCLE.

24:38.188 --> 24:40.190
‐ <i>( applause )</i>
‐ OKAY, LISTEN UP, LOSERS.

24:40.190 --> 24:42.833
WE'RE GONNA GET
TRIVIA NIGHT STARTED HERE.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.396
WE'VE GOT 90 BUCKS
IN THE POT TONIGHT,

24:45.396 --> 24:48.719
SO LET'S SEE IF ANYONE
CAN BEAT MY 12‐WEEK
WINNING STREAK.

24:48.719 --> 24:50.921
WELL, LOOK WHAT
THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

24:50.921 --> 24:53.564
‐ SURPRISE, SURPRISE.
‐ WHAT? I LIKE TRIVIA.

24:53.564 --> 24:55.526
‐ RIGHT.
‐ WE KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

24:55.526 --> 24:56.847
‐ OH, REALLY?
AND WHY'S THAT?
‐ GODOT.

24:56.847 --> 24:58.849
‐ HE'S BEHIND THE BAR.
‐ YES, I SEE HIM.

24:58.849 --> 25:00.691
AND HE'S HERE MOST NIGHTS
WHEN HE'S IN TOWN,

25:00.691 --> 25:02.853
SO NO SPECIAL JOURNALISTIC
AWARDS FOR YOU GUYS.

25:02.853 --> 25:04.174
IS THAT THE DRESS
YOU'RE WEARING?

25:04.174 --> 25:05.336
YES, ODDLY ENOUGH,
THE DRESS I'M WEARING

25:05.336 --> 25:06.337
IS THE DRESS I'M WEARING.

25:06.337 --> 25:08.379
‐ OH.
‐ WHAT?

25:08.379 --> 25:11.742
‐ NOTHING, IT'S‐‐
‐ A DRESS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
GOTTEN MONDO COMPLIMENTS ON

25:11.742 --> 25:13.584
FROM MANY PEOPLE,
GUY PEOPLE.

25:13.584 --> 25:14.945
AND USUALLY THE BEST KIND
OF COMPLIMENT‐‐

25:14.945 --> 25:16.987
THE MUCH‐COVETED
"SECOND LOOK AS I WALK AWAY."

25:16.987 --> 25:19.710
I DON'T THINK THAT SECOND LOOK
MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS.

25:19.710 --> 25:20.911
Sam:
<i>BE SURE TO DRINK A LOT</i>
<i>BECAUSE THE DRUNKER</i>

25:20.911 --> 25:22.793
YOU ARE,
THE SMARTER I LOOK.

25:22.793 --> 25:25.796
OH, UH,
LOOKS LIKE MILLY STONE,

25:25.796 --> 25:28.839
THE OWNER
OF THE TRIVIA EQUIPMENT,
WANTS TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

25:28.839 --> 25:30.641
‐ MILLY?
‐ <i>( applause )</i>

25:30.641 --> 25:32.443
HELLO? IS THIS‐‐
IS THIS THING ON?

25:32.443 --> 25:34.445
‐ ( laughs )
‐ WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.206
WELL, YOU DID
THAT COMEDIAN THING.

25:36.206 --> 25:39.169
"IS THIS THING ON?
HELLO, I'M RICHARD PRYOR.

25:39.169 --> 25:40.771
TAKE MY WIFE, PLEASE."

25:40.771 --> 25:42.733
I ACTUALLY JUST
WANTED TO KNOW IF
THE THING WAS ON.

25:42.733 --> 25:44.735
OH. WELL, THAT'S FUN TOO.

25:44.735 --> 25:46.937
EVERYBODY, HELLO.
WELCOME.

25:46.937 --> 25:48.939
WE'RE HERE TO HAVE FUN.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

25:48.939 --> 25:50.581
BUT A QUICK WORD
OF WARNING.

25:50.581 --> 25:53.784
THE TRIVIA MACHINES
ARE NOT TONKA TOYS,
OKAY?

25:53.784 --> 25:57.788
THEY'RE DELICATE PIECES
OF TECHNOLOGY THAT COST
ME A LOT OF MONEY.

25:57.788 --> 26:00.951
DON'T ABUSE THEM.
AND WATCH THE GREASY FINGERS.

26:00.951 --> 26:04.234
IN FACT, ALL SALES OF
BUFFALO WINGS ARE SUSPENDED

26:04.234 --> 26:05.836
UNTIL THE GAME IS OVER.

26:05.836 --> 26:07.678
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE.

26:07.678 --> 26:08.959
I'M GONNA GO TELL
THE KITCHEN STAFF.

26:08.959 --> 26:10.681
SHE DOES NOT
OWN THE PLACE.

26:10.681 --> 26:13.684
THEN I'M JUST GONNA BUY
ALL THE BUFFALO WINGS
AND THROW THEM OUT.

26:13.684 --> 26:17.247
ALL RIGHT. WELL, GANG,
ORDER UP THE BUFFALO WINGS
QUICK, 'CAUSE SHE MEANS IT.

26:17.247 --> 26:19.249
NOW PUT YOUR PHONES AWAY
AND LET'S BEGIN.

26:19.249 --> 26:21.131
‐ ( crowd chattering )
‐ HEY, MICHELLE.

26:21.131 --> 26:22.773
‐ YOU WANNA BE MY PARTNER?
‐ FOR TRIVIA?

26:22.773 --> 26:24.735
NO, IN LIFE.
I'M OFF GUYS NOW.

26:24.735 --> 26:26.136
YES, FOR TRIVIA.

26:26.136 --> 26:27.698
I'M DESPERATE
FOR A PERFECT SCORE.

26:27.698 --> 26:29.700
MY ONLY WEAKNESS
IS THE ARTSY AND THE FARTSY.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.702
‐ YEAH, OKAY,
LET'S DO IT.
‐ OKAY.

26:31.702 --> 26:34.064
WELL, IT'S ALL MULTIPLE CHOICE,
SO IF YOU KNOW IT, HIT IT.

26:34.064 --> 26:35.866
I'M PUNCHING IN
OUR TEAM NAME NOW.

26:35.866 --> 26:37.748
‐ IT'S "SAMCHELLE."
‐ THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

26:37.748 --> 26:38.749
NOT REALLY.

26:38.749 --> 26:40.150
<i>( bells chime )</i>

26:40.150 --> 26:42.032
OKAY, GEOGRAPHY IS ME.

26:42.032 --> 26:46.677
"WHAT IS THE ONLY EUROPEAN
COUNTRY TO STILL HAVE TERRITORY
IN SOUTH AMERICA?"

26:46.677 --> 26:47.878
‐ <i>( buzzer sounds</i> )
‐ GOT IT.

26:47.878 --> 26:48.879
‐ ( applause )
‐ MAX POINTS!

26:48.879 --> 26:50.000
GOOD GOING, SAM.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.002
AH, EVERYONE GOT IT.
THEY ALWAYS START OUT EASY.

26:52.002 --> 26:54.284
THAT WAS EASY?
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
ONE COUNTRY ON THAT LIST.

26:54.284 --> 26:55.526
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE FRANCE?

26:55.526 --> 26:57.608
NO, I RECOGNIZED FRANCE.
IT JUST LOOKED WEIRD.

26:57.608 --> 26:59.810
‐ <i>( bells chime )</i>
‐ OOH, THAT'S A WEAK SPOT
FOR ME.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.812
NOT FOR ME.
EASY‐PEASY.

27:01.812 --> 27:04.495
"WHAT CHARACTER DID
JACKIE GLEASON PLAY
IN 'SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT'?"

27:04.495 --> 27:06.657
‐ IT'S ALL YOURS, PARTNER.
‐ "HARLIN JENKINS,"
"WILLIE BUFORD."

27:06.657 --> 27:07.818
THEY'RE ALL
SOUNDING THE SAME.

27:07.818 --> 27:09.300
KINDA THE POINT
OF THE CHALLENGE THERE.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.422
I CAN PICTURE OTHER CHARACTERS
SAYING HIS NAME.

27:11.422 --> 27:12.903
( southern accent )
WELL, HEY THERE,

27:12.903 --> 27:15.786
WHATEVER‐YOUR‐NAME‐IS,
WHERE'S THAT VARMINT
GOING OFF TO?

27:15.786 --> 27:18.028
‐ THAT'S ACTUAL DIALOGUE
FROM THE MOVIE?
‐ IT'S STUFF LIKE THAT.

27:18.028 --> 27:20.351
YOU KNOW THAT THE LONGER YOU
TAKE, THE FEWER POINTS WE GET.

27:20.351 --> 27:22.713
( southern accent )
HEY, SOMEONE GET...
JACKIE GLEASON GUY

27:22.713 --> 27:23.714
ON THE HORN THERE.

27:23.714 --> 27:26.236
OH, GOOD GRIEF.

27:26.236 --> 27:27.718
<i>‐ ( buzzer sounds )</i>
<i>‐ Sam: PHEW, AT THE BUZZER.</i>

27:27.718 --> 27:29.560
‐ I WAS GONNA GET IT.
‐ TODAY?

27:29.560 --> 27:31.562
'CAUSE IT KINDA NEEDED
TO HAPPEN TODAY.

27:33.764 --> 27:36.967
SO, UH,
YOU PLAYING ALONE?

27:36.967 --> 27:38.609
YUP.

27:38.609 --> 27:39.970
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
PLAY WITH A PARTNER.

27:39.970 --> 27:42.172
I DON'T NEED A PARTNER.
I HAVE MY TROLL DOLL.

27:43.934 --> 27:46.537
I KNOW THE BUGS.

27:46.537 --> 27:49.099
‐ WHAT BUGS?
‐ IN THE SOFTWARE.

27:49.099 --> 27:51.302
WE COULD WIN THIS.

27:51.302 --> 27:52.703
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

27:52.703 --> 27:55.746
‐ <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>
‐ <i>( applause and cheers )</i>

27:55.746 --> 27:57.227
Sam:
<i>IF YOU DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>THE ANSWER,</i>

27:57.227 --> 27:58.469
‐ DON'T PRESS THE BUTTON.
‐ I THOUGHT I KNEW IT.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.030
"THOUGHT" DOES NOT
GET YOU 90 BUCKS.

28:00.030 --> 28:02.272
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
I USED TO BE REALLY
GOOD AT TRIVIA.

28:02.272 --> 28:03.954
MY HEAD WAS FULL
OF USELESS KNOWLEDGE.

28:03.954 --> 28:06.156
I PRIDED MYSELF
ON KNOWING THINGS
THAT WOULD NEVER COME

28:06.156 --> 28:09.360
INTO ACTUAL PLAY IN DAY‐TO‐DAY
LIFE, BUT WOULD DAZZLE A CROWD
AT A SWELL PARTY.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.561
‐ THEY'RE PUTTING UP
ANOTHER QUESTION.
‐ <i>( bells chime )</i>

28:10.561 --> 28:12.122
BUT NOW WHEN I THINK,
NOTHING HAPPENS.

28:12.122 --> 28:13.764
THERE'S JUST A FAINT

28:13.764 --> 28:15.766
RATTLING SOUND
ECHOING UP THERE.

28:15.766 --> 28:17.728
‐ YOU'RE BLOCKING THE BUTTON!
‐ I'M GETTING DUMBER.

28:17.728 --> 28:19.770
I'M ACTUALLY
LOSING INTELLIGENCE.

28:19.770 --> 28:21.572
EVER SINCE I FOUND OUT
I DIDN'T GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL,

28:21.572 --> 28:23.574
KNOWLEDGE IS SEEPING
OUT OF MY BRAIN.

28:23.574 --> 28:24.655
YOU DIDN'T
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?

28:24.655 --> 28:25.696
NO, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

28:25.696 --> 28:26.857
MORE AND MORE, YES.

28:26.857 --> 28:28.299
‐ <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>
‐ CRAP! JILL KELLEY.

28:28.299 --> 28:29.580
‐ I KNEW THAT ONE!
‐ ( cheers )

28:29.580 --> 28:30.901
‐ <i>( bells chime )</i>
‐ WAIT, BROADWAY!

28:30.901 --> 28:32.222
‐ THIS HAS ME
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.
‐ ARE YOU SURE?

28:32.222 --> 28:33.544
I'M SURE.
I'M COMPLETELY SURE.

28:33.544 --> 28:35.025
‐ <i>( bells chime )</i>
‐ OKAY, HAVE AT IT.

28:35.025 --> 28:39.029
"THIS 1961 BROADWAY FLOP WAS
BASED ON THE WELL‐KNOWN NOVEL

28:39.029 --> 28:40.230
AND STARRED MARY TYLER MOORE."

28:40.230 --> 28:42.873
GREAT, 1961.
THAT WOULD BE "LEGS DIAMOND"

28:42.873 --> 28:43.914
OR "THE RINK."
WAS IT "THE RINK"?

28:43.914 --> 28:45.316
THOSE AREN'T ON THE SCREEN.

28:45.316 --> 28:47.117
‐ I CAN SEE THE POSTER.
‐ NO, DON'T LOOK AT THE POSTER;

28:47.117 --> 28:48.759
‐ LOOK AT THE SCREEN.
‐ IT'S "NO STRINGS."

28:48.759 --> 28:50.000
"NO STRINGS"
OR "TAKARAZUKA."

28:50.000 --> 28:51.241
NONE OF THOSE
ARE ON THE SCREEN!

28:51.241 --> 28:52.242
BUT NONE OF THOSE
ARE RIGHT.

28:52.242 --> 28:53.604
NO, ONE OF THEM IS RIGHT.

28:53.604 --> 28:54.805
BUT THE MACHINE
COULD BE WRONG.

28:54.805 --> 28:55.726
YOU'RE A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT,

28:55.726 --> 28:57.047
YOU'RE NOT SMARTER
THAN THE MACHINE.

28:57.047 --> 28:58.849
OKAY, SO IT'S EITHER
"KWAMINA," "LET IT RIDE,"

28:58.849 --> 29:00.451
"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S,"
OR "SHOW GIRL."

29:00.451 --> 29:02.453
GREAT, YOU NARROWED IT DOWN
FROM FOUR TO FOUR.

29:02.453 --> 29:04.575
‐ <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>
‐ <i>( cheers and applause )</i>

29:04.575 --> 29:06.577
‐ AND WE FORFEITED.
‐ WE FORFEITED?

29:06.577 --> 29:10.301
YES, IT'S A WORD THAT MEANS
WE SIMPLY GAVE UP WITHOUT
EVEN TRYING.

29:10.301 --> 29:12.222
BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN
GETTING IT WRONG, ISN'T IT?

29:19.670 --> 29:20.911
TELL ME I LOOK PRETTY.

29:20.911 --> 29:23.914
‐ YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY.
‐ YOU LOOK PRETTY TOO.

29:23.914 --> 29:26.557
‐ MARTINI?
‐ PLEASE.

29:26.557 --> 29:28.879
‐ SO YOU'RE NOT DOING
THE TRIVIA THING.
‐ NO.

29:28.879 --> 29:30.681
BRAINS ARE OVERRATED
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

29:30.681 --> 29:32.803
THEY DO AS MUCH BAD STUFF
AS GOOD STUFF.

29:32.803 --> 29:34.565
I DID NOT
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.807
YEAH, HIGH SCHOOL'S
A BAD TRIP.

29:36.807 --> 29:40.010
AND FOR A WHILE, I CARED.
BUT I'M CARING LESS NOW.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.812
WHO NEEDS IT?

29:41.812 --> 29:44.014
I GOT A NICE DRINK
AND A GOOD VIEW.

29:44.014 --> 29:45.736
SIMPLE PLEASURES.

29:45.736 --> 29:47.298
TO YOU AND ME.

29:48.739 --> 29:50.100
HERE'S TO BEING DUMB.

29:57.227 --> 29:58.869
YOU'RE NOT DRINKING.
WHY AREN'T YOU DRINKING?

29:58.869 --> 30:00.511
GOTTA WORK.

30:00.511 --> 30:02.713
YEAH, THAT'S A NICE
CLEAN GLASS.

30:02.713 --> 30:03.794
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE TOAST?

30:05.676 --> 30:07.718
I HAVE A MASTERS
IN OCEANOGRAPHY.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.720
( chuckling )
WOW, REALLY?

30:09.720 --> 30:11.281
YES, REALLY.

30:11.281 --> 30:13.043
AND I'M THINKING ABOUT
GOING FOR A Ph. D.

30:13.043 --> 30:14.845
OH, WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

30:14.845 --> 30:18.248
UM, SO THEY LET
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS GET PhDs?

30:18.248 --> 30:20.331
I DIDN'T SAY I WAS
A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

30:20.331 --> 30:21.732
OKAY. SORRY.

30:23.894 --> 30:26.216
SO THE SURFING THING WORKED OUT
REALLY WELL FOR YOU THEN?

30:26.216 --> 30:27.498
IT REALLY DID.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.779
GREAT.

30:28.779 --> 30:30.821
I'M GUESSING THAT YOU AND ME
TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT‐‐

30:30.821 --> 30:32.503
NO. NOT TONIGHT.

30:32.503 --> 30:33.704
( quietly )
YEAH.

30:37.428 --> 30:39.229
‐ THAT LOOKED BRUTAL.
‐ WAS IT THE DRESS?

30:39.229 --> 30:41.432
NO, IT WAS NOT THE DRESS.
IT WAS THE GIRL IN THE DRESS.

30:41.432 --> 30:42.713
SHE'S A MORON, OFFICIALLY.

30:42.713 --> 30:44.395
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
MAYBE YOU CAN UN‐SAY IT.

30:44.395 --> 30:46.717
‐ IN A BETTER OUTFIT.
‐ DID HE SAY SOMETHING BAD
TO YOU?

30:46.717 --> 30:48.919
<i>DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, LADIES.</i>
<i>IT'S JUST NOT MY NIGHT.</i>

30:48.919 --> 30:50.521
BATHROOM, DRINK, HOME.

30:51.842 --> 30:53.003
YOU REALLY DO
HAVE TO GET MARRIED

30:53.003 --> 30:55.646
BY A CERTAIN AGE,
OR IT IS SO SO SAD.

30:57.808 --> 30:58.769
( all gasp )

30:58.769 --> 31:00.371
( all murmuring )

31:05.175 --> 31:06.817
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

31:06.817 --> 31:08.018
YOU KICKED HIS ASS,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

31:08.018 --> 31:10.821
I JUST SAW RED,
THEN HE WAS ON
THE FLOOR.

31:10.821 --> 31:13.023
‐ I'M THE HULK.
‐ BUT WITH LONGER LEGS.

31:13.023 --> 31:15.025
‐ BATHROOM BREAK.
‐ OOH, ME TOO.

31:15.025 --> 31:18.148
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE.
I'M UNSTABLE AND I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

31:18.148 --> 31:19.990
THERE'LL STILL BE TIME
TO CLAW OUR WAY UP

31:19.990 --> 31:22.353
FROM LAST PLACE
TO NEXT‐TO‐LAST PLACE
WHEN WE GET BACK.

31:24.755 --> 31:27.077
HULK WATCH TABLE.

31:27.077 --> 31:29.880
WHAT A DIFFERENCE
A DAY MAKES, HUH?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.882
THIS MORNING I WAS SMART,

31:31.882 --> 31:33.083
AND NOW I'M DUMB.

31:34.204 --> 31:35.366
I KNEW YOU THIS MORNING.

31:35.366 --> 31:36.367
YOU WEREN'T THAT SMART.

31:36.367 --> 31:38.369
YEAH, BUT I HAD HOPE
OF BEING SMART.

31:38.369 --> 31:40.210
THERE WAS A LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE
TUNNEL.

31:40.210 --> 31:42.212
‐ A SMALL LIGHT.
‐ YEAH, BUT A LIGHT.

31:42.212 --> 31:44.375
A PENLIGHT WITH A WEAK,
DYING BATTERY.

31:44.375 --> 31:47.177
YOU'RE NOT
A SUPER‐HUGGY GUY, YOU KNOW?

31:47.177 --> 31:49.300
LOOK, I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO SIT DOWN HERE, OKAY?

31:49.300 --> 31:52.703
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE
A BEER AND PLAY A GAME
AND RELAX A LITTLE

31:52.703 --> 31:54.264
BEFORE I GO HOME
TO MY MOTHER,

31:54.264 --> 31:56.467
WHO IS STAYING WITH ME
IN MY ONE‐ROOM APARTMENT,

31:56.467 --> 32:00.431
AND LISTEN TO HER QUESTION
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY
LIFE CHOICES.

32:00.431 --> 32:02.232
SO IF I'M NOT BEING
SUFFICIENTLY HUGGY,

32:02.232 --> 32:04.755
I'M SURE THERE ARE
MANY MANY PEOPLE HERE
WHO MAY NOT KNOW

32:04.755 --> 32:07.157
THAT FIVE MINUTES
WITH YOU FEELS LIKE
A LIFETIME.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.122
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MY DRESS?

32:19.169 --> 32:21.372
MILLY, MICHELLE SIMMS.
REMEMBER?

32:21.372 --> 32:24.014
‐ CAN I RUN SOMETHING
PAST YOU REALLY QUICK?
‐ SURE. HOLD ON A SECOND.

32:24.014 --> 32:28.819
EXCUSE ME? THROW AWAY EVERY
FRENCH FRY IN THE PLACE,
AND PUT IT ON MY TAB.

32:28.819 --> 32:30.180
SIT OVER HERE.

32:32.823 --> 32:34.825
SO, WHAT'S UP?

32:34.825 --> 32:37.187
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU'RE IN THE MARKET FOR
ANY NEW BUSINESS VENTURES.

32:37.187 --> 32:40.270
MAYBE, BUT NOTHING ILLEGAL‐‐
NO DRUGS, NO GUNS, NO GIRLS.

32:40.270 --> 32:42.072
THIS WOULDN'T INVOLVE
DRUGS OR GUNS OR GIRLS.

32:42.072 --> 32:44.355
WELL, NOT DIRTY GIRLS.
THERE WOULD BE GIRLS, THOUGH.

32:44.355 --> 32:46.757
‐ I WAS JOKING.
I JOKE SOMETIMES.
‐ OH, OKAY.

32:46.757 --> 32:49.520
WELL, YOU KNOW ALL THAT LAND
THAT FANNY FLOWERS AND I OWN?

32:49.520 --> 32:51.762
WELL, IT'S JUST KINDA
SITTING THERE IDLE,

32:51.762 --> 32:54.124
AND I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU'D LIKE TO BUY ANY OF IT.

32:54.124 --> 32:56.967
IT'S NOT ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT, SO WHAT COULD I
POSSIBLY DO WITH IT?

32:56.967 --> 32:58.489
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
BOCCE, CROQUET?

32:58.489 --> 33:00.371
IT'S GREAT LAND.
THE CANDLE GUY LOVES IT.

33:00.371 --> 33:02.172
‐ WHY ARE YOU LOOKING TO SELL?
‐ <i>BECAUSE WE NEED CAPITAL.</i>

33:02.172 --> 33:03.814
WE'RE ADDING
A PERFORMANCE AREA.

33:03.814 --> 33:05.055
YOU'RE EXPANDING
YOUR DANCE STUDIO?

33:05.055 --> 33:06.256
NO, WE'RE BUILDING
AN AMPHITHEATER.

33:06.256 --> 33:08.258
AN AMPHITHEATER?
REALLY?

33:08.258 --> 33:10.220
‐ <i>YEAH.</i>
‐ AN OUTDOOR AMPHITHEATER?

33:10.220 --> 33:12.383
FOR OUR KIDS' PERFORMANCES,
AND IF IT'S AS NICE

33:12.383 --> 33:16.066
AS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE,
WE'LL RENT IT OUT TO OTHERS
FOR DANCE EVENTS, THEATER.

33:16.066 --> 33:17.468
‐ LIKE PLAYS?
‐ SURE.

33:17.468 --> 33:19.189
NOW <i>THIS</i> I'M INTERESTED IN.

33:19.189 --> 33:21.632
‐ YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?
‐ PARTNERING ON
THE AMPHITHEATER.

33:21.632 --> 33:24.435
PARTNERING? NO, WAIT.
THE AMPHITHEATER WASN'T WHAT‐‐

33:24.435 --> 33:27.157
‐ I'M A PATRON
OF THE ARTS, YOU KNOW?
‐ I DID NOT KNOW.

33:27.157 --> 33:29.360
I JUST SAW
"JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING
TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT"

33:29.360 --> 33:31.161
AT THE VENTURA PERFORMING
ARTS CENTER.

33:31.161 --> 33:33.163
MARIO LOPEZ WAS SO GOOD.

33:33.163 --> 33:36.807
‐ YES, HE IS GOOD, BUT‐‐
‐ AND I EVEN DID A LITTLE
ACTING MYSELF IN HIGH SCHOOL.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.209
"UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE,"
I WAS JUST ONE OF THE KIDS,

33:39.209 --> 33:40.851
BUT I CAUGHT A BIT
OF THE BUG.

33:40.851 --> 33:42.413
‐ <i>DO WE HAVE DRAWINGS YET?</i>
‐ NOT REALLY.

33:42.413 --> 33:44.895
I'VE GOT A GREAT ARCHITECT.
WE SHOULD GET HIM
STARTED ON THIS.

33:44.895 --> 33:46.457
I LOVE THIS IDEA.

33:46.457 --> 33:48.299
CAN WE GET TOGETHER NEXT WEEK
AND GET THIS ROLLING?

33:48.299 --> 33:50.661
‐ I GUESS.
‐ I KNOW THERE ARE TONS
OF DETAILS TO IRON OUT

33:50.661 --> 33:53.103
WITH YOU, ME AND FANNY,
BUT IT WILL GO SMOOTHLY.

33:53.103 --> 33:54.264
THIS IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE AWKWARD

33:54.264 --> 33:56.467
"I BUY LOW‐INCOME HOUSING
AND KICK EVERYONE OUT

33:56.467 --> 33:58.389
<i>TO BUILD CONDOS" THINGS</i>
<i>LIKE LAST WEEK.</i>

33:58.389 --> 34:00.391
THIS IS A LABOR OF LOVE.

34:01.752 --> 34:03.994
LET'S TOAST.
I LIKE TO SEAL DEALS

34:03.994 --> 34:06.116
WITH SHOTS OF ANY SORT
OF BLUE ALCOHOL.

34:06.116 --> 34:07.918
‐ YEAH, ME TOO.
‐ I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

34:07.918 --> 34:10.120
YOU SHOULD CALL FANNY
AND TELL HER ABOUT THIS.

34:12.563 --> 34:14.084
I DEFINITELY SHOULD.

34:18.208 --> 34:21.211
SAW YOUR MOVES.
BARTENDER, THE GIRL?

34:21.211 --> 34:23.213
THINK YOU MIGHT DIG IT.

34:30.381 --> 34:32.062
YOU DECK ANYONE
WHILE WE WERE GONE?

34:32.062 --> 34:34.665
‐ ALL'S QUIET
ON THE WESTERN FRONT.
‐ <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

34:34.665 --> 34:37.308
OKAY, GAME OVER, EVERYONE.
LET'S SEE WHO WON.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.470
<i>( drumrolls )</i>

34:39.470 --> 34:40.631
FRANKIE AND COZETTE?

34:40.631 --> 34:43.193
<i>WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?</i>

34:46.677 --> 34:48.198
YOU'RE GOING INTO BUSINESS
WITH MY SISTER?

34:48.198 --> 34:49.480
HOW DO YOU
ALREADY KNOW THAT?

34:49.480 --> 34:51.922
I SAW HER ORDERING SHOTS OF
SOME BLUE ALCOHOL AT THE BAR.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.124
THAT'S HER CELEBRATION DRINK.
I ASKED AND SHE TOLD ME.

34:54.124 --> 34:56.286
IT'S ALL HAPPENING SO FAST.
BUT YES, I THINK WE ARE.

34:56.286 --> 34:58.889
‐ YOU KNOW I HATE HER.
‐ I DO KNOW THAT.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.891
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU GO
INTO BUSINESS WITH HER,
YOU'LL REGRET IT.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.453
I OPENED UP MY STORE
IN HER BUILDING

35:02.453 --> 35:04.295
AND SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
LET ME NAME MY OWN STORE.

35:04.295 --> 35:05.536
YOU DIDN'T NAME
SPARKLES "SPARKLES"?

35:05.536 --> 35:08.178
NO. SHE DID.
AFTER ONE OF HER PRECIOUS CATS.

35:08.178 --> 35:10.180
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
SHE PUT THE CAT TO SLEEP.

35:10.180 --> 35:12.543
‐ WAS IT OLD?
‐ IT WAS FOUR.
SHE WAS TIRED OF IT.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.024
WELL, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
SOME OTHER‐‐

35:14.024 --> 35:15.225
SHE KILLS THE THINGS
SHE DOESN'T LIKE.

35:15.225 --> 35:17.628
( sighs ) WELL, TRULY,
SHE HAS MONEY.

35:17.628 --> 35:19.229
AND FANNY AND I
NEED MONEY.

35:19.229 --> 35:21.231
YES. SURE.

35:21.231 --> 35:25.596
SHE HAS MONEY AND BUILDINGS
AND LEASES THAT SHE WANTS
PEOPLE TO SIGN,

35:25.596 --> 35:28.238
AND I HAVE NOTHING
AND I WILL LOSE MY STORE

35:28.238 --> 35:29.560
AND YOU AND FANNY
AND EVERYTHING.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.362
AND MILLY WILL HAVE EVERYTHING
AND I WILL HAVE NOTHING.

35:31.362 --> 35:32.763
YOU'RE NOT
LOSING FANNY, TRULY.

35:34.325 --> 35:35.606
AND YOU'RE NOT LOSING ME.

35:35.606 --> 35:37.207
( quietly )
IT FEELS LIKE IT.

35:37.207 --> 35:39.370
BUT MILLY'S NOT MY FRIEND.

35:39.370 --> 35:42.212
‐ YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
‐ REALLY?

35:42.212 --> 35:43.734
REALLY.

35:43.734 --> 35:46.176
YOU NEVER INVITED ME
TO VEGAS.

35:46.176 --> 35:49.380
WELL, TRULY, THE NEXT TIME
I HAVE SOME SORT OF
EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN

35:49.380 --> 35:51.382
AND RUN FROM EVERYTHING
THAT IS GOOD AND STABLE
IN MY LIFE,

35:51.382 --> 35:53.304
I PROMISE I'LL INVITE YOU
TO COME AND WATCH.

35:53.304 --> 35:55.706
OKAY.

35:55.706 --> 35:57.708
DID SHE TELL YOU SHE WAS
IN "UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE"?

35:57.708 --> 36:00.591
'CAUSE SHE WAS TERRIBLE
IN "UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE."

36:00.591 --> 36:02.793
HEY, TRULY.
DON'T WORRY.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.274
THERE'S PLENTY
FOR EVERYBODY.

36:04.274 --> 36:05.956
A TOAST...

36:05.956 --> 36:08.719
TO THE MILLICENT STONE
PERFORMING ARTS CENTER.

36:12.363 --> 36:14.965
FORGOT MY CHANGE.
BE RIGHT BACK.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.567
WAS SHE MAYBE KIDDING
ABOUT THE "MILLICENT STONE"‐‐

36:16.567 --> 36:19.289
SHE ALWAYS GETS
EVERYTHING SHE WANTS.

36:19.289 --> 36:22.333
WELL...

36:22.333 --> 36:23.734
SHE DIDN'T GET HUBBELL.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.466
Ginny:
<i>8:00 AND THE EVENING</i>
<i>IS OVER. SO SAD.</i>

36:35.466 --> 36:36.867
ARE WE SERIOUSLY GONNA BE
THE LAST TOWN IN THE WORLD

36:36.867 --> 36:38.389
TO GET A BOWLING ALLEY
OR A CRACK HOUSE?

36:38.389 --> 36:39.870
TRIVIA NIGHT BLOWS.

36:39.870 --> 36:42.313
YEAH, AND WHEN DID THEY
START GIVING OUT SHINY,
BLUE WINNER RIBBONS?

36:42.313 --> 36:44.114
WHEN COZETTE MOVED TO TOWN,
THAT'S WHEN.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.275
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS,
ORDER PIZZA

36:45.275 --> 36:47.478
AND PLAN HOW FAR AWAY
WE'LL ALL GO TO COLLEGE.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.842
WHAT THE‐‐

37:04.094 --> 37:05.736
‐ SASHA!
‐ WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:05.736 --> 37:07.338
‐ WITH?
‐ THE BOXES,

37:07.338 --> 37:09.340
‐ THE LAURA PALMER FURNITURE.
‐ NOTHING.

37:09.340 --> 37:11.382
‐ YOU WANNA WATCH A MOVIE?
‐ ARE YOU MOVING?

37:11.382 --> 37:13.544
‐ NO.
‐ IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE MOVING.

37:13.544 --> 37:15.666
MY PARENTS ARE JUST
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.267
IS THE POINT
THAT YOU'RE MOVING?

37:17.267 --> 37:18.869
THE PARENTS
ARE SPLITTING UP.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.271
‐ AGAIN?
‐ WELL, THIS TIME IT'S OFFICIAL.

37:21.271 --> 37:23.674
MY FATHER'S JOINED THE CAST
OF "BOY MEETS WORLD"

37:23.674 --> 37:26.196
WITH ANOTHER BOY
IN ANOTHER WORLD.

37:26.196 --> 37:27.598
WOW, THE CLOSET DOOR OPENED.

37:27.598 --> 37:29.440
YEAH, HE SAYS HE'S MOVING
TO SAN JOSE;

37:29.440 --> 37:31.241
SHE SAYS SHE'S MOVING
TO ENCINO.

37:31.241 --> 37:32.403
I'M SUPPOSED TO PICK
WHERE I WANNA GO.

37:32.403 --> 37:34.084
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

37:34.084 --> 37:35.446
WHAT THE HELL
IS IN SAN JOSE?

37:35.446 --> 37:37.408
ALL THAT INFORMATION‐‐
THAT'S THE PIECE THAT STUCK?

37:37.408 --> 37:39.610
IT'S THE ONLY TRULY
SURPRISING PART
OF THE STORY.

37:39.610 --> 37:42.453
‐ YOU WANNA WATCH TV?
‐ I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T
TELL US YOU WERE MOVING.

37:42.453 --> 37:44.054
WERE EVEN GONNA LEAVE
A BREAKUP LETTER?

37:44.054 --> 37:46.056
SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST GOING
TO SNEAK OFF IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

37:46.056 --> 37:47.458
AND TAKE ALL THE CLOTHES
SHE BORROWED FROM US
WITH HER.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.460
I DO NOT BORROW CLOTHES
FROM YOU.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.302
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU'RE MOVING.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.262
( gasps )
OH MY GOD, BOO.

37:52.262 --> 37:53.664
WHEN SHE HEARS,
SHE'LL FREAK.

37:53.664 --> 37:55.666
‐ SHE'S BAD WITH CHANGE.
‐ REMEMBER WHEN YOU GREW BOOBS?

37:55.666 --> 37:56.987
SHE WOULDN'T LOOK AT YOU
FOR A MONTH.

37:56.987 --> 37:59.390
STOP.
DO NOT PANIC BOO.

37:59.390 --> 38:00.511
NOBODY'S MOVING.

38:02.272 --> 38:04.875
MELANIE, GINNY,
I NEED YOU GUYS
TO GO HOME NOW PLEASE.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.877
‐ UH, SURE.
‐ YEAH.

38:06.877 --> 38:07.878
RIGHT?

38:07.878 --> 38:08.919
HILARIOUS!

38:10.761 --> 38:12.403
TRUCKS ARE HERE
TOMORROW AT SEVEN.

38:12.403 --> 38:15.165
STREET CLEANING DAY‐‐
NO PARKING. GREAT PLANNING.

38:15.165 --> 38:16.447
SASHA, PLEASE.
I AM EXHAUSTED.

38:16.447 --> 38:19.249
JUST PACK YOUR STUFF.
FIGURE OUT WHERE

38:19.249 --> 38:21.532
<i>YOU WANNA GO.</i>
<i>WRITE IT ON THE BOX.</i>

38:21.532 --> 38:23.334
VERY MATURE.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.855
<i>WHAT ARE GONNA DO?</i>

38:24.855 --> 38:25.936
LIVE ON YOUR OWN?

38:25.936 --> 38:27.538
I WAS ON MY OWN
ALL SUMMER AT JOFFREY.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.940
I GOT BACK THREE WEEKS AGO.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.181
I'LL BE FINE.

38:31.181 --> 38:33.143
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE
BALLET SCHOOLS IN L. A.

38:33.143 --> 38:34.425
NOT INTERESTED IN
"DANCING WITH THE STARS,"

38:34.425 --> 38:35.426
THANKS.

38:35.426 --> 38:37.828
FINE. THEN GO
WITH YOUR FATHER.

38:37.828 --> 38:41.151
HE HAS A GUEST HOUSE.
YOU CAN HAVE AN ENTIRE
STRUCTURE TO SULK IN.

38:41.151 --> 38:43.273
I'M TRYING
TO DOWNSIZE. PASS.

38:43.273 --> 38:44.475
( sighs )

38:45.996 --> 38:47.798
FINE. FINE.

38:47.798 --> 38:50.000
YOU DON'T WANNA MOVE?
DON'T MOVE.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.242
YOU'VE GOT TWO WEEKS
TILL ESCROW CLOSES
ON THE HOUSE.

38:52.242 --> 38:55.125
I'LL LEAVE YOU THE FRIDGE.
HATE THAT DAMN GLASS DOOR
ANYWAY.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.727
WAIT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA LEAVE?

38:56.727 --> 38:59.890
TOMORROW, AS SOON AS ALL
THIS STUFF IS ON THE TRUCK.

38:59.890 --> 39:02.573
LAST CHANCE, SASHA.
YOU COMING WITH?

39:06.016 --> 39:07.818
NO?

39:07.818 --> 39:10.821
OKAY. FINE.

39:14.264 --> 39:17.428
AND I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK,
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

39:17.428 --> 39:19.430
THAT ONE'S ON YOU, KID.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.156
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

39:42.653 --> 39:44.254
YOU'RE ONE DEVOTED
AVON LADY.

39:44.254 --> 39:46.457
‐ SHE GAVE ME THE KEYS.
‐ WHAT?

39:46.457 --> 39:49.300
I DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS
GONNA GIVE ME THE KEYS,
BUT SHE DID.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.462
‐ I DON'T‐‐
‐ HERE THEY ARE.

39:51.462 --> 39:53.063
MY PARENTS
ARE SPLITTING UP.

39:53.063 --> 39:55.466
MY DAD'S GOT A BOYFRIEND
AND THEY WANNA LIVE IN SAN JOSE.

39:55.466 --> 39:57.308
‐ BREATHE.
‐ MY MOM'S MOVING TO ENCINO.

39:57.308 --> 39:59.069
SHE WANTED ME TO CHOOSE
AND I CAN'T CHOOSE.

39:59.069 --> 40:01.472
I CAN'T GO.
I CAN'T LEAVE.

40:01.472 --> 40:03.073
I WON'T LEAVE.

40:03.073 --> 40:05.676
I TOLD HER THAT I WON'T LEAVE
AND SHE GAVE ME THE KEYS.

40:05.676 --> 40:07.077
OH OH OH, BOY.

40:07.077 --> 40:08.479
THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM.

40:08.479 --> 40:10.321
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
MOST OF THEM ARE FOR.

40:10.321 --> 40:12.082
IS THERE A JANITOR'S CLOSET
SOMEWHERE IN MY HOUSE

40:12.082 --> 40:13.283
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

40:13.283 --> 40:15.646
UH. WELL, THAT ONE
LOOKS LIKE A BIKE LOCK.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.448
I'M SUPPOSED TO CARRY AROUND
ALL THESE KEYS?

40:17.448 --> 40:19.490
TO SCHOOL?
IN MY DANCE BAG?

40:19.490 --> 40:21.652
WHAT IF I LOSE THEM
OR LEAVE THEM SOMEWHERE?

40:21.652 --> 40:24.014
SHOULD I GET COPIES AND STASH
THEM IN THOSE FAKE ROCKS

40:24.014 --> 40:25.416
PEOPLE STASH KEYS IN?

40:25.416 --> 40:27.017
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THIS WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

40:27.017 --> 40:28.258
IF I COULD OFFER YOU
A DRINK.

40:28.258 --> 40:30.260
THEY DON'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE REAL ROCKS.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.463
I GUESS YOU'RE HOPING
YOUR BURGLAR FORGOT
HIS GLASSES

40:32.463 --> 40:34.264
THE DAY HE CAME
TO ROB YOU.

40:34.264 --> 40:37.147
YOU KNOW, AT WEDDINGS
THEY SOMETIMES LET KIDS
DRINK CHAMPAGNE, RIGHT?

40:38.268 --> 40:39.470
I WON'T LEAVE.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.071
I'M STAYING HERE.

40:41.071 --> 40:42.673
I LIVE HERE.

40:46.917 --> 40:48.319
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.442
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

40:51.442 --> 40:52.523
BUT...

40:54.244 --> 40:56.407
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

40:56.407 --> 40:57.848
