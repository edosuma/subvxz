WEBVTT

00:21.129 --> 00:25.327
You can run, but you can't hide
from the Lord.

00:28.538 --> 00:31.098
You can never
judge a woman with bad...

01:11.613 --> 01:15.208
Sarah Rose knows
you're a beautiful person.

01:16.284 --> 01:21.222
Sarah Rose knows
you have an unusual talent.

01:21.256 --> 01:26.354
Sarah Rose knows
you're a teenage girl.

01:26.396 --> 01:29.193
And she definitely knows...

01:29.232 --> 01:33.965
that you are ready for
the ultimate in teen glamour.

01:36.104 --> 01:40.541
The American
Teen Princess Pageant!

01:40.575 --> 01:43.340
And now, a few words
from last year's host...

01:43.378 --> 01:45.744
Mr. Adam West!

01:45.782 --> 01:48.273
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

01:48.316 --> 01:54.187
has been enriching the lives of
American-made girls since 1945.

01:54.222 --> 01:56.850
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

01:56.893 --> 02:01.387
provides personal growth,
scholarship, travel!

02:01.431 --> 02:05.265
And you might even meet
a few celebrities.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.597
Yes!

02:06.636 --> 02:08.103
At the national level...

02:08.136 --> 02:11.664
thousands of seventeen-year-old
girls like yourselves...

02:11.741 --> 02:14.710
compete around the country
in places like...

02:14.744 --> 02:17.178
beautiful Mount Rose,
Minnesota...

02:17.212 --> 02:21.206
and make it all the way
here to Lincoln, Alabama...

02:21.249 --> 02:25.380
to compete for the title
of American Teen Princess.

02:25.420 --> 02:28.857
So which one of you will it be?

02:28.890 --> 02:34.659
Like sands through the hourglass
so are the "Days Of Our Lives. "

02:37.499 --> 02:40.128
God, Iris, you taped
your shows over it.

02:40.168 --> 02:41.500
I'm sorry.

02:47.143 --> 02:49.873
Now, ladies,
the rest of the tape...

02:49.911 --> 02:52.345
which is now gone forever...

02:52.381 --> 02:55.645
goes on about starting
that great journey...

02:55.685 --> 02:58.813
which we call the American
Teen Princess Pageant.

02:58.855 --> 03:00.584
So any of you young ladies...

03:00.622 --> 03:02.352
who'd like to start
on that journey...

03:02.391 --> 03:04.791
you just come right down here
and sign up.

03:04.826 --> 03:07.727
And, please, help yourself
to some coffee and bars.

03:09.499 --> 03:11.433
Showtime.

03:13.034 --> 03:14.365
Do you think
most people would say...

03:14.403 --> 03:16.701
that teenage beauty pageants
are a good idea?

03:16.772 --> 03:18.171
Oh, yeah, sure.

03:18.206 --> 03:19.867
I know what some of your
big-city, no-bra-wearin'...

03:19.941 --> 03:22.409
hairy-legged
women libbers might say.

03:22.445 --> 03:23.911
They might say that a pageant...

03:23.945 --> 03:26.311
is old-fashioned
and demeaning to the girls.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.374
What's sick is women
dressing like men.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.009
You betcha, Iris.

03:30.052 --> 03:32.019
No, I think you boys
are going to find something...

03:32.054 --> 03:33.817
a little bit different
here in Mount Rose.

03:33.855 --> 03:36.221
For one thing,
we're all God-fearin' folk.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.988
Every last one of us.

03:38.026 --> 03:42.395
And you will not find a
"back room" in our video store.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.559
No, that filth is better
left to the sin cities.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.660
A.k. a. Minneapolis, St. Paul.

04:10.393 --> 04:11.860
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:11.893 --> 04:13.326
Freda, sure.

04:13.361 --> 04:15.693
She was the oldest
living Lutheran.

04:15.731 --> 04:18.459
Now she's as dead as a doornail.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.024
It's the damn Shriners
who won't take down...

04:21.069 --> 04:23.799
that goddamn sign,
the lazy sons of bitches.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.807
Every year... every damn year,
I tell 'em...

04:26.842 --> 04:29.310
"Take down
the goddamn Freda sign...

04:29.378 --> 04:30.845
"you lazy sons of bitches!"

04:44.493 --> 04:48.259
Today's "to do" list includes
a trip to the Mall of America...

04:48.296 --> 04:50.264
where we are going
to be buying outfits...

04:50.298 --> 04:51.663
for the physical fitness number.

04:51.701 --> 04:52.725
Nothing too showy.

04:52.768 --> 04:54.360
No. You betcha, Iris.

04:54.403 --> 04:56.803
We need that third judge.
Gosh, don't let me forget...

04:56.872 --> 04:58.066
We need to think of a theme.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.540
Gladys, look out!

05:00.575 --> 05:02.543
Gosh darn it.
Hello, Father Dunegan.

05:02.612 --> 05:04.341
Sidewalks? Sidewalks?

05:05.914 --> 05:08.475
Iris, stop it.
It's not his fault.

05:08.517 --> 05:12.077
The communal wine just proves
too tempting for some of them.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.587
That's why we Lutherans
use grape Kool-Aid...

05:13.623 --> 05:14.988
for the blood of Christ.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.891
There's a parking space
over there.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.985
Oh, no.
That's just a compact. Sorry.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.791
You'd think they'd have
the parking lot of America...

05:21.831 --> 05:23.422
to go with the Mall of America.

05:23.466 --> 05:26.196
It's a $200 fine!

05:26.234 --> 05:29.204
I told you I would move the car
if a cripple came.

05:29.271 --> 05:32.468
Now just run in the store
and pick out some outfits.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.565
All right, let's go.

05:33.643 --> 05:35.110
Wait, wait, wait.

05:35.177 --> 05:36.405
What?

05:36.445 --> 05:38.139
I think I just thought
of the theme.

05:38.180 --> 05:40.875
Oh, what?

05:40.916 --> 05:43.510
"Proud to be an American. "

05:43.552 --> 05:46.851
So, what was the theme
of the pageant last year?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.653
Oh, that was "Buy American. "

05:49.691 --> 05:51.454
And the year before that was...

05:51.494 --> 05:53.689
"U.S.A. Is A-OK!"

05:53.729 --> 05:56.493
And can you remember the theme
of your favorite pageant?

05:56.531 --> 05:58.523
Can I?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.363
"Amer-I Can!"

06:01.771 --> 06:03.897
People ask me where I get this.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.372
I don't know.
A gift from God or something.

06:17.552 --> 06:18.713
Hi.

06:18.754 --> 06:22.417
Just introduce yourself
and tell us why...

06:22.457 --> 06:23.924
you're signing up
for the pageant.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.119
OK. Hi. Hi.

06:26.162 --> 06:28.755
I'm Leslie Miller.

06:28.798 --> 06:32.427
I'm signing up 'cause,
you know...

06:32.467 --> 06:34.527
I always watch
the pageants on TV...

06:34.569 --> 06:37.733
and my boyfriend
thinks I'll win.

06:37.807 --> 06:39.365
For my talent,
I'm going to be doing...

06:39.442 --> 06:41.033
You've been talking
to this guy long enough.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.101
I'm trying to tell him...

06:43.178 --> 06:44.373
Now?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.752
Hi, Pat.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.277
Go Muskies!

06:56.092 --> 07:01.393
Hi. I'm Amber Atkins,
and I'm signing up...

07:01.430 --> 07:04.125
'cause my two favorite people
in the whole world...

07:04.166 --> 07:06.191
competed in pageants...

07:06.234 --> 07:09.033
my mom and Diane Sawyer.

07:09.071 --> 07:10.538
Course, I hope I end up...

07:10.605 --> 07:13.006
a little more like Diane Sawyer
than my mom.

07:23.785 --> 07:26.220
Do you do
any of the embalming?

07:26.254 --> 07:28.780
Oh, my God, no. Oh, God.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.758
I just do the hair and makeup
on the deceased.

07:32.961 --> 07:34.428
I'm lucky I have
an afterschool job...

07:34.463 --> 07:35.930
where I can practice my talent.

07:40.402 --> 07:43.859
Oh, yeah, sure.
Every pageant is special...

07:43.939 --> 07:49.274
but this one
is extra-super-special to me.

07:49.311 --> 07:52.678
When I was seventeen...
I don't know if you know this...

07:52.714 --> 07:58.984
I was crowned Mount Rose's
American Teen Princess...

07:59.020 --> 08:01.181
and this year...

08:01.223 --> 08:03.952
drumroll, please...

08:03.992 --> 08:09.056
my lovely daughter
Rebecca Ann Leeman is competing.

08:10.665 --> 08:11.927
Is this my mark?

08:13.835 --> 08:17.862
Hi. I'm Rebecca Leeman,
and I believe this pageant...

08:17.939 --> 08:19.805
is an important experience
for every young woman.

08:19.841 --> 08:21.968
It...

08:22.044 --> 08:25.012
Well, it teaches you what's
really important in life...

08:25.047 --> 08:28.015
and it has the power
to change you...

08:28.050 --> 08:30.040
in ways you've never dreamed of.

08:39.693 --> 08:43.027
My mom gave me this nine-mill
for my thirteenth birthday.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.761
Yeah. I'll always remember
what she wrote in the card.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.826
"Jesus loves winners. "

08:47.869 --> 08:51.328
That's why no matter what I do,
I aim to win.

08:56.478 --> 09:00.641
Why?
Well, it's kinda like asking...

09:00.682 --> 09:04.448
why all the guys chew
Copenhagen, you know?

09:04.486 --> 09:06.044
If you're seventeen...

09:06.088 --> 09:09.818
and you're not a total fry,
it's just what you do.

09:11.326 --> 09:13.886
Have you decided what
your talent is going to be yet?

09:13.929 --> 09:17.228
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm gonna sing and dance...

09:17.265 --> 09:19.460
to "New York, New York. "

09:19.501 --> 09:22.264
I just fell in love with
the Big Apple last summer...

09:22.304 --> 09:24.703
when I was visiting
my brother Peter there.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.741
He followed his dream
all the way to New York.

09:27.809 --> 09:31.074
Wait.

09:31.113 --> 09:35.014
Here's Peter as... Liza!

09:35.050 --> 09:37.075
Here's him as Madonna.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.780
As Barbara.

09:48.897 --> 09:52.425
I don't know what
my talent's gonna be yet.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.036
Kenny! Kenny, come.
Come, Kenny.

09:57.105 --> 10:00.200
Oh, Kenny!
Oh, this is Kenny.

10:00.275 --> 10:01.903
Spike, my German shepherd...

10:01.977 --> 10:04.537
he went to live
with a nice family on a farm...

10:04.613 --> 10:06.376
after he attacked me...

10:06.415 --> 10:08.848
but it wasn't his fault,
was it, Kenny? No.

10:08.884 --> 10:11.717
I had beef jerky
in my front pocket.

10:16.258 --> 10:19.455
They remade my belly
with skin from my butt.

10:19.494 --> 10:24.831
I was Mount Rose American
Teen Princess in 1945.

10:24.866 --> 10:29.270
We were at war with the Japs.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.499
Didn't even get to keep
my damn tiara.

10:31.572 --> 10:35.134
I had to turn it in for scrap.

10:41.215 --> 10:46.677
So we adopt Molly three year ago
when we come to America...

10:46.722 --> 10:50.249
to help acclimate us
to American.

10:50.292 --> 10:52.521
To America, Dad.

10:55.097 --> 10:57.462
She all-American girl.

10:57.499 --> 11:00.194
She our Teen American Princess.

11:00.234 --> 11:01.462
Oh, Ma.

11:08.677 --> 11:10.144
English!

11:10.212 --> 11:12.680
Speak English,
you stupid little retard!

11:12.714 --> 11:17.584
So, Molly, tell movie man
what you talent do.

11:17.618 --> 11:19.552
I'll be line dancing.

11:19.588 --> 11:21.954
Country western!

11:21.990 --> 11:23.959
Clint Black, ruff!

11:23.992 --> 11:27.553
Hey, what he got that I not got?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.166
So have you decided what
your talent is going to be...

11:32.200 --> 11:33.565
for the pageant yet?

11:33.602 --> 11:37.697
Yeah. I'll be doing
a dramatic monologue...

11:37.773 --> 11:41.765
and right now
I'm thinking "Othello... "

11:41.843 --> 11:43.641
or "Soylent Green... "

11:43.678 --> 11:46.943
Well, my own version of it.

11:46.982 --> 11:49.609
You know, a lot of girls
make a smooth transition...

11:49.650 --> 11:51.015
from pageants into acting.

11:51.053 --> 11:52.645
Competing for the title...

11:52.687 --> 11:57.124
of Minnesota's American Teen
Princess sure was exciting...

11:57.159 --> 11:59.126
but I never could have won...

11:59.161 --> 12:02.152
without my Saint Paul
pork products.

12:02.197 --> 12:06.428
I've been enjoying Saint Paul
pork products for years.

12:06.468 --> 12:09.301
I grew up right next
to these stockyards.

12:09.337 --> 12:12.102
It's still the same
family-run business...

12:12.174 --> 12:16.304
that Walter and Vera Pularski
started in 1920...

12:16.378 --> 12:19.814
when they raised
and slaughtered their first pig.

12:23.885 --> 12:27.548
I just love
Saint Paul pork products.

12:27.588 --> 12:30.581
In fact, I love 'em so much...

12:30.625 --> 12:32.958
I work here now!

12:34.629 --> 12:37.462
Oh, help yourself.

12:40.836 --> 12:42.599
Thanks.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.162
You're welcome.

12:44.238 --> 12:46.230
My talent will be...

12:46.308 --> 12:47.673
an interpretive...

12:50.579 --> 12:52.342
dance...

12:52.381 --> 12:54.940
while I sign...

12:54.982 --> 12:57.884
"Through the Eyes of Love. "

12:57.919 --> 13:01.184
Yeah. Well, see...

13:01.223 --> 13:03.315
I have a dream...

13:03.357 --> 13:06.588
of spreading sign language...

13:06.627 --> 13:09.188
around the world.

13:11.233 --> 13:15.862
Mom, will you be so kind?

13:24.179 --> 13:26.204
Tammy Curry...

13:26.280 --> 13:28.145
and I'm signing up
for the pageant...

13:28.183 --> 13:29.342
'cause of
the scholarships and all.

13:29.383 --> 13:31.352
This one's for varsity soccer.

13:31.385 --> 13:32.784
I'm captain.

13:32.821 --> 13:36.347
I run track, and right here
I'm the new president...

13:36.390 --> 13:37.880
of the Lutheran
Sisterhood Gun Club.

13:37.925 --> 13:40.325
Love that one.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.300
Would you say...

13:47.335 --> 13:49.395
you have a good chance
to win this pageant?

13:49.438 --> 13:51.405
Yeah. You bet I do.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.035
I mean, maybe other people think
I can't win a beauty pageant...

13:55.110 --> 13:57.374
but other people didn't think
I could beat out...

13:57.411 --> 14:01.872
Becky Leeman for president of
the gun club, either, and I did.

14:01.917 --> 14:04.316
It's just like
Anthony Robbins says...

14:04.352 --> 14:05.581
"I'm a winner.

14:05.620 --> 14:08.385
"Nobody can stop me but me. "

14:19.101 --> 14:22.558
Well, you know, I think
everybody's doing really well...

14:22.603 --> 14:24.970
considering the fact
she was so young.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.734
It's always hard to see
the young ones called home.

14:26.807 --> 14:29.800
Especially
on an exploding thresher.

14:29.877 --> 14:33.336
It's just so odd and gross.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.882
You know, sometimes...

14:34.916 --> 14:38.148
it's hard to understand
God's great plan.

14:39.955 --> 14:41.922
But the show must go on.

14:41.957 --> 14:43.788
I gotta get ahold of Ted...

14:43.824 --> 14:45.849
and ask him if we can use that
barn light as a spot again...

14:45.893 --> 14:48.055
so you watch
the Jell-O salad, OK?

14:48.095 --> 14:50.290
You girls gonna sign up
for the pageant this year?

14:50.332 --> 14:52.322
I ain't gonna be
in no goddamn pageant.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.335
Look what happened
to that dork-ass farm girl.

14:54.368 --> 14:55.392
Tammy Curry?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.666
Yeah. Everyone says
this is a big accident?

14:57.738 --> 14:59.707
She got iced
because she wins everything...

14:59.740 --> 15:01.765
and this time someone
didn't want her to win.

15:01.842 --> 15:03.367
This pageant's
like a Roach Motel.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.412
Girls check in,
but they don't check out.

15:05.479 --> 15:08.414
Yeah, and they say smoking's
bad for your health.

15:12.753 --> 15:16.689
And... tendu, close.
Tendu, close.

15:16.725 --> 15:19.318
Tendu, close, pliÃ©.

15:19.361 --> 15:20.588
And repeat.

15:20.629 --> 15:21.890
Tendu...

15:21.929 --> 15:23.955
Suck in the bellies, girls!

15:23.999 --> 15:26.057
And tuck in the tushes!

15:26.101 --> 15:27.568
Close those legs.

15:27.602 --> 15:30.470
You look like a bunch
of bowlegged cows.

15:30.539 --> 15:33.030
Other side!

15:33.108 --> 15:36.544
And tendu, close. Tendu, close.

15:36.611 --> 15:37.943
Tendu, close, pliÃ©.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.777
Yeah, you boys
sure picked a good year.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.783
If I was a betting woman...

15:42.818 --> 15:44.250
and there was a line
on this in Vegas...

15:44.286 --> 15:47.016
I'd lay down ten to one
that it all comes down...

15:47.054 --> 15:49.284
to Amber Atkins
and Becky Leeman.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.154
Oh, sweet Jesus.

15:51.193 --> 15:52.683
What a showdown this should be.

15:52.728 --> 15:54.662
If Cain and Abel...

15:54.695 --> 15:56.857
Oh, God!

15:56.897 --> 15:58.626
That's so embarrassing.

16:05.006 --> 16:09.603
My winning the Mount Rose...

16:09.678 --> 16:15.912
American Teen Princess Pageant
really changed my life.

16:15.951 --> 16:20.182
Amber does my hair once a week.

16:20.222 --> 16:22.485
Well, it's the least I can do...

16:22.524 --> 16:27.427
for the reigning Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

16:27.461 --> 16:29.759
- Oh, God.
- What?

16:29.798 --> 16:32.699
Oh, just a little snarl.

16:32.733 --> 16:34.394
Don't tell.

16:36.270 --> 16:38.795
What? Oh, my God.

16:38.874 --> 16:42.741
Lights, camera, and me
without a stitch of makeup on.

16:42.778 --> 16:44.803
What are you guys doing here?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.574
What are you doing here?

16:46.615 --> 16:51.847
Oh, Amber, like you're
the only one who visits Mary?

16:51.887 --> 16:54.116
Who are you?

16:54.156 --> 16:58.525
"Who are you?"
Oh, Mary, you kill me.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.424
She always says that.

17:00.462 --> 17:03.090
It's a little game
we play every week.

17:03.130 --> 17:05.223
Same dippy little look
on her face.

17:05.267 --> 17:07.665
"Who are you? Who are you?"

17:07.702 --> 17:09.170
Just like that.

17:09.204 --> 17:11.797
It's me... Becky.

17:11.872 --> 17:15.502
And I brought your favorites.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.375
Real nice, Becky.
She's anorexic.

17:18.412 --> 17:22.371
She's skinny, Amber, not deaf.

17:44.638 --> 17:48.507
So, beyond this pageant
you must have certain dreams...

17:48.542 --> 17:50.511
and certain things
you aspire to, yeah?

17:51.545 --> 17:53.878
Yeah, I got dreams.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.846
Sometimes I dream of winning.

17:57.885 --> 17:59.513
I dream of getting out
of Mount Rose...

17:59.553 --> 18:03.216
and being a big-time reporter
like Diane Sawyer.

18:03.257 --> 18:06.124
I mean, guys get out of
Mount Rose all the time...

18:06.161 --> 18:08.891
for hockey scholarships...

18:08.929 --> 18:10.329
or prison.

18:10.364 --> 18:13.731
Yeah, 1963.

18:13.769 --> 18:15.395
Her beauty worked against her...

18:15.437 --> 18:18.735
when she started as a reporter
in Louisville, her hometown.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.398
Those were different times.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.635
That's my mom.

18:23.712 --> 18:25.474
Hey, Amber,
did you get my smokes?

18:25.514 --> 18:27.947
Yeah. I'll get 'em in a sec.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.110
Aw, shit.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.517
They're from Los Angeles.

18:31.552 --> 18:33.817
They wanted to see my room
and film me for their movie.

18:33.854 --> 18:36.948
Yeah, well, if they ask you
to take your top off...

18:36.992 --> 18:38.982
get the money first.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.995
And go get my smokes!

18:59.580 --> 19:02.105
Hey, hey, you like it?

19:02.149 --> 19:03.616
- Open it.
- This?

19:03.652 --> 19:05.119
Yeah, the globe.

19:05.152 --> 19:06.881
Go on,
pull on the North Pole there.

19:06.922 --> 19:08.116
Here, watch.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.214
Honey, this isn't a showroom.

19:09.256 --> 19:11.520
See, this holds three
full-size booze bottles.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.858
Tape cassette
comes out of Afghanistan.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.865
All right, all right.

19:17.898 --> 19:20.697
How quickly they forget
where this all comes from.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.202
Taiwan.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.865
That's enough, young lady.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.907
I beg your pardon.
Would you like a drink?

19:26.942 --> 19:28.773
Lmpartial?

19:28.809 --> 19:31.438
When I'm outside these walls,
I am Gladys Leeman...

19:31.480 --> 19:33.846
president Civil Servettes,
impartial as the day is long.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.907
But I'm in my house now,
and I gotta warn you...

19:35.951 --> 19:38.180
I'm wearing my wife apron
and my mom hat...

19:38.220 --> 19:40.119
so I can safely say
that I am the mother...

19:40.155 --> 19:43.146
of the most talented contestant
Mount Rose has ever had.

19:43.190 --> 19:45.159
Oh, gosh, she's been
singing and dancing...

19:45.192 --> 19:46.955
since she was knee-high
to a pig's eye.

19:46.994 --> 19:49.156
Yeah, she's damn
near as good as...

19:49.196 --> 19:51.165
you know, that little...
that black fellow...

19:51.198 --> 19:52.756
the one with the glass eye...

19:52.801 --> 19:53.926
the Candy Man...

19:53.969 --> 19:56.437
- Sammy Davis, Jr.
- Yeah, the Jew.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.199
Nice one, Dad. He's dead.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.015
Yeah. Then we have
the Judges Interview.

20:12.052 --> 20:15.021
Where each girl has a little
ten-minute get-together...

20:15.055 --> 20:17.489
with the judges
prior to the pageant.

20:17.526 --> 20:18.993
Then we have the...

20:23.697 --> 20:24.959
Hello, Tony.

20:28.235 --> 20:29.361
Hey to the folks.

20:29.403 --> 20:30.735
Yeah, all right.

20:30.805 --> 20:32.499
Gladys, the Judges Interview.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.246
So you've judged a lot
of pageants over the years?

20:43.285 --> 20:45.651
No. No. No way. No.

20:45.686 --> 20:47.655
Never judged a pageant
before in my life.

20:49.658 --> 20:51.181
No way.

20:51.225 --> 20:53.217
Never been around young girls.

20:57.598 --> 21:00.329
I mean, even if I was...

21:00.367 --> 21:02.495
I mean, why would I want
to be, you know?

21:02.536 --> 21:04.265
I don't get off
on that kind of thing.

21:04.338 --> 21:06.034
That's really
why you're asking, right?

21:09.443 --> 21:10.877
Someone say something?

21:19.688 --> 21:20.949
Do you judge the pageant
every year?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.321
No. I've never judged
nothin' before.

21:23.357 --> 21:26.190
Harold, are we on "Cops"?

21:26.227 --> 21:27.386
Are we on "Cops," Harold?

21:27.429 --> 21:28.759
Shut up, Hank.
This here's business.

21:31.565 --> 21:33.692
Harold,
Mom said not in the head!

21:33.734 --> 21:36.260
Well, Mom's dead,
so shut your flytrap.

21:36.303 --> 21:38.829
I will if you shut your piehole.

21:48.717 --> 21:50.184
Don't make me...

21:50.217 --> 21:51.411
Don't make me kick you
where the good Lord...

21:51.453 --> 21:53.478
Don't make me
split you where you...

21:53.521 --> 21:55.215
Come on!
You want some of this!

21:57.459 --> 21:58.686
So, are you excited?

21:58.727 --> 22:00.160
Oh, you bet.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.685
We're happier than the day
Hankie got acquitted.

22:02.731 --> 22:05.528
I get made a judge, then
the furniture store hires us...

22:05.566 --> 22:07.660
to paint the whole damn thing.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.669
We're going to use the money...

22:09.703 --> 22:11.694
to get our mom
a proper headstone...

22:11.740 --> 22:15.072
and to move her out
to the cemetery.

22:19.114 --> 22:21.309
Listen, guys,
if you see anything you like...

22:21.348 --> 22:24.340
you just let me know because
I happen to know the owner.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.546
So, here we are.

22:26.587 --> 22:28.885
My place of business,
my little house of worship...

22:28.923 --> 22:31.687
the world's largest
Conestoga wagon.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.556
Right here, we have
a very attractive unit.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.426
Farmers like that one.

22:36.464 --> 22:39.160
OK, showtime.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.100
Hey, Tim, Carla, listen...

22:42.137 --> 22:44.628
you two don't Jew me down
too much on that dinette...

22:44.705 --> 22:47.071
I'll throw in a hutch
for free, OK?

22:47.108 --> 22:49.098
See, that's my specialty.

22:49.176 --> 22:52.907
You don't pay less,
I give you more.

22:52.947 --> 22:56.713
The secret is... the hutch
is included in the price.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.413
Ain't that right, Jean?

22:59.453 --> 23:01.751
Take a memo, sweetheart.

23:15.035 --> 23:17.334
Five, six, seven... and one...

23:17.371 --> 23:19.566
Get that tempo right.
Kick it!

23:19.640 --> 23:20.766
Come on, kick it!

23:28.083 --> 23:30.846
Just watching the young girls.

23:30.885 --> 23:33.183
Contestants. You know...

23:33.220 --> 23:35.711
like the rest of my friends
and neighbors.

23:40.661 --> 23:42.128
Are you getting her?

23:42.163 --> 23:43.686
The third one, the blond one.

23:43.732 --> 23:45.461
Leave him alone. It's OK.

23:51.539 --> 23:55.600
It's just a camera I keep
in the glove compartment...

23:55.676 --> 23:59.841
for... car accidents.
Insurance.

24:02.783 --> 24:04.752
I mean, you guys got a camera...

24:04.785 --> 24:06.879
and no one's accusing you
of anything, right?

24:24.839 --> 24:27.807
So, Brett, you want to go
to the lake with me on Thursday?

24:27.842 --> 24:31.470
Actually,
I got practice on Thursday.

24:31.545 --> 24:33.035
Well, maybe Friday then.

24:33.114 --> 24:35.547
A bunch of us
were going cow tipping.

24:35.583 --> 24:38.245
Well...

24:38.285 --> 24:40.253
I'm kind of busy on Friday.

24:53.634 --> 24:55.033
Give her your tray, Brett.

24:55.069 --> 24:57.333
You're holding up the line.

24:59.174 --> 25:00.834
Give it to her.

25:00.908 --> 25:02.809
Here, I'll take it.
It's my job.

25:02.843 --> 25:05.074
No. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.876
Well, you're supposed
to put it in the...

25:12.420 --> 25:14.614
Aw, man.

25:14.655 --> 25:17.852
You got some lutefisk
in your hair.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.655
Then it must be Wednesday.

25:21.595 --> 25:25.964
Lutefisk is codfish
that's been salted...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.695
and soaked in lye
for a week or so.

25:31.206 --> 25:33.572
It's best with lots of butter.

25:33.607 --> 25:37.476
I'm not really busy on Friday.

25:37.511 --> 25:39.979
I was just saying that,
you know?

25:40.047 --> 25:41.173
I know.

25:41.215 --> 25:42.774
Well...

25:42.817 --> 25:45.341
if you wanted to do something...

25:45.386 --> 25:48.514
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. You bet.

25:48.556 --> 25:50.023
Oh, crap.

25:50.057 --> 25:52.049
I probably gotta work
at the funeral home.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.083
We're real busy
this time of year.

25:54.128 --> 25:56.562
Hunting season.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.328
Well, I'm cutting out of here
early today...

25:59.366 --> 26:01.062
and doing
a little duck hunting...

26:01.102 --> 26:02.898
but maybe I could
call you tonight?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.096
Yeah, sure.

26:05.372 --> 26:06.533
- All right.
- Fine.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.380
Oh, God.

26:23.424 --> 26:26.154
You don't think Becky
saw you guys, do you?

26:26.193 --> 26:28.024
Look, you shouldn't be in here.

26:28.062 --> 26:29.427
Doreen gave us hair nets.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.193
No, listen.
We shouldn't talk here.

26:32.233 --> 26:35.326
Stop by my house tonight, OK?

26:36.871 --> 26:38.030
Go.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.178
They take out her butt?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.781
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.451
Oh, are we on "Cops" again?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.255
OK, be quiet.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.627
It's just the guys
that are, you know...

27:03.664 --> 27:05.565
making the movie
about the pageant.

27:05.599 --> 27:07.659
I told you all about 'em.
This here's Loretta.

27:07.701 --> 27:10.261
I tell Annette, you talk to me
during my stories...

27:10.304 --> 27:12.363
you might as well
be talking to the wall.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.872
You guys want a beer?

27:13.908 --> 27:15.966
No, thank you. Is Amber here?

27:16.043 --> 27:17.408
Oh, no. You just missed her.

27:17.445 --> 27:19.845
She got called down
to the bone gardens.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.711
She's in a hell of a mood today.

27:21.749 --> 27:23.545
Say, you boys been
to the Leemans'?

27:23.583 --> 27:24.811
Shut it, Loretta.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.286
If so, you got all the pictures
of the winner you need.

27:27.321 --> 27:28.447
- Shut it.
- It's true.

27:32.460 --> 27:35.792
Let's just say who should win,
who deserves to win is Amber.

27:35.830 --> 27:39.265
Why don't you just paint
a target on your ass?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.164
Best damn tapper,
the most smartest.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.328
Most smartest?

27:42.369 --> 27:44.838
Oh, that's great.
You're real educated.

27:44.905 --> 27:47.203
"Most smartest. "
Get a picture of that.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.674
Most smartest.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.041
I'm cutting you off
and sending you home.

27:50.077 --> 27:53.274
Excuse me, but I'm bragging up
your kid here.

27:53.314 --> 27:54.644
I know. Come on, let's go.

27:54.682 --> 27:56.478
Amber's gonna be the next
Diane Sawyer, you know.

27:56.517 --> 27:57.882
They're making a movie here.

27:57.918 --> 27:59.818
All right,
they're making a movie.

27:59.854 --> 28:02.084
What makes you think
that Becky's going to win?

28:02.123 --> 28:03.316
Why do I think Becky'll win?

28:03.357 --> 28:04.949
You're talking... Don't pinch.

28:04.992 --> 28:07.392
You're talking about the richest
family in a small town.

28:07.428 --> 28:10.055
It's front-page news
when one of 'em takes a shit.

28:10.097 --> 28:11.291
Oh, great.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.895
Can one of you boys
give me a ride home?

28:14.935 --> 28:16.164
Don't fall for it.

28:16.203 --> 28:17.670
She lives two trailers down.

28:17.738 --> 28:18.932
So? Be real easy.

28:19.006 --> 28:20.440
Go on home, Loretta.

28:20.474 --> 28:22.636
Go on. The party's over.

28:32.553 --> 28:33.918
Oh, my God!

28:33.954 --> 28:36.890
Jesus Christ on a cross!

28:36.923 --> 28:39.790
Look, number one rule
in a funeral home...

28:39.827 --> 28:42.056
Never sneak up on the living.

28:42.096 --> 28:43.722
You never know who could
have an embalming needle...

28:43.764 --> 28:45.664
or a skull saw in their hand.

28:45.699 --> 28:48.065
Mr. Larson's son
learned the hard way.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.229
He's buried next to my grandpa.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.168
Are you upset about Brett?

28:58.245 --> 29:00.111
Upset about Brett?

29:00.147 --> 29:03.446
Nah. Hazard of the trade.

29:04.552 --> 29:08.386
I don't really have time
for guys anyways.

29:08.422 --> 29:09.685
It's weird, though.

29:09.723 --> 29:12.557
He took it
right between the eyes.

29:13.861 --> 29:15.419
Don't often see that.

29:17.498 --> 29:20.261
So, you know,
Brett just got shot in the head.

29:20.301 --> 29:21.528
He did?

29:21.569 --> 29:23.468
Well, hunting's dangerous.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.198
So, anyways, my mom gave me
this thirty-aught...

29:27.274 --> 29:28.764
for my sixteenth birthday.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.473
I need Stella now.

29:35.516 --> 29:37.506
The family's steaming
like a cow pie in July.

29:37.551 --> 29:40.019
Said she doesn't look nothin'
like the picture they gave you.

29:40.054 --> 29:42.112
Sorry. I just thought she might
not want to meet her maker...

29:42.156 --> 29:43.747
looking like a cheap whore.

29:43.791 --> 29:46.725
Well, this cheap whore
is that family's loving mother.

29:46.761 --> 29:49.286
The Clemens
said to make him look...

29:49.330 --> 29:51.093
like he just came in
from snowmobiling.

29:51.132 --> 29:52.564
Pink cheeks and...

29:52.600 --> 29:54.966
Red nose and ears.
I know, I know.

30:10.151 --> 30:14.349
Sorry I couldn't talk to you
before in the cafeteria.

30:14.387 --> 30:16.150
I was scared, OK?

30:16.190 --> 30:19.784
I open my locker today
after first period...

30:19.827 --> 30:24.287
and there's a picture
of Tammy Curry taped inside.

30:24.331 --> 30:26.391
This was written on the back:

30:28.502 --> 30:31.495
Oh, yeah,
hell of a way to go, there.

30:31.572 --> 30:34.267
After some thorough
investigating...

30:34.341 --> 30:37.777
we determined
that the Curry girl...

30:37.845 --> 30:40.507
must have been smoking
and driving.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.345
Well, yeah, Tammy liked
to drive her dad's thresher...

30:43.384 --> 30:45.477
but, I mean...

30:45.519 --> 30:47.714
She said the heavy vibration
helped her think.

30:47.755 --> 30:51.281
But I know for a fact Tammy
only smoked after a good drive.

30:51.324 --> 30:54.954
You ask me or anyone else who
isn't scared to talk about it...

30:54.995 --> 30:56.963
Tammy was murdered.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.835
I bet Diane Sawyer never had
to deal with crap like this.

31:02.870 --> 31:05.030
If it's another stray bullet
to the head...

31:05.106 --> 31:06.403
I'm gonna need more caps.

31:06.474 --> 31:07.702
You have to go home.

31:07.775 --> 31:09.800
There's some kind of emergency
at the trailer park.

31:09.877 --> 31:11.036
Relax. That's my ma's code...

31:11.112 --> 31:12.579
for bring home milk
and a carton of Lucky...

31:12.646 --> 31:15.843
No. Loretta called.
There's been a fire.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.777
Oh, my God.

31:42.309 --> 31:44.573
Hey, hey, hey! Family?

31:44.612 --> 31:47.580
No, she's just screaming "Mom"
because she's got Turret's.

31:47.647 --> 31:48.979
She's Annette's kid, dipshit.

31:49.015 --> 31:51.917
She's alive, sweetie.
She's right over there.

31:57.358 --> 31:59.416
I'll be right behind you
in the hearse, OK?

31:59.460 --> 32:01.553
Don't let that worry you,
Annette!

32:12.640 --> 32:17.577
So, Doctor, is this sort
of an unusual injury?

32:17.611 --> 32:19.977
This was a doozie.

32:20.014 --> 32:23.414
Right now our chief concern
is to stabilize Annette here...

32:23.451 --> 32:26.113
and then in surgery...

32:26.152 --> 32:27.619
remove this.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.179
Oh, God.

32:30.224 --> 32:31.884
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.

32:31.926 --> 32:34.826
Ruined a brand-new pair
of Lee Press-Ons.

32:34.862 --> 32:38.991
Well, I sat down to have a beer,
and kablooey.

32:39.033 --> 32:40.500
Next thing I know...

32:40.533 --> 32:42.968
something blows
through my kitchen window...

32:43.003 --> 32:46.803
and I'm ass-up
in somebody's flower bed.

32:46.874 --> 32:49.933
Hey, ass-wipe, quit dicking
around with the camera.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.308
Just put another book under it.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.539
Dude, don't say "ass-wipe. "

32:52.580 --> 32:56.015
Mom's got the window open.
We gotta hurry up, though...

32:56.082 --> 32:58.209
because we only got three
frickin' minutes on the battery.

32:58.251 --> 32:59.514
All right, ready.

32:59.552 --> 33:00.713
One, two...

33:00.755 --> 33:01.881
One, two, three!

33:06.160 --> 33:07.285
Shit!

33:07.328 --> 33:08.625
Let's get out of here!

33:12.999 --> 33:15.229
I shoved your tap shoes
in my panties...

33:15.268 --> 33:17.430
before I was blown
out of the house.

33:17.470 --> 33:19.803
You go find the guy
who cut 'em off.

33:19.874 --> 33:20.965
He'll give 'em to you...

33:21.041 --> 33:24.443
so you can practice
for the pageant.

33:27.181 --> 33:28.477
About that...

33:31.552 --> 33:33.645
I... Oh, my God!

33:36.122 --> 33:39.388
Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

33:39.427 --> 33:41.690
She's pregnant!

33:41.729 --> 33:43.593
Oh, Amber, wait!

33:43.631 --> 33:46.122
Come back here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.

33:46.167 --> 33:47.861
And then kill you!

33:47.902 --> 33:50.029
Why don't you see
if there's any more beer...

33:50.070 --> 33:51.970
left in that can
and relax a bit?

33:53.973 --> 33:56.703
- I'm quitting the pageant.
- You're what?

33:56.776 --> 33:58.368
I'm quitting the pageant.

33:58.446 --> 34:02.280
I was just trying to scare you
into changing your mind.

34:02.315 --> 34:04.216
Christ, the woman clung
to your tap shoes...

34:04.250 --> 34:06.741
while flying through the air
like a goddamn lawn dart.

34:06.786 --> 34:08.014
I know, I know.

34:08.054 --> 34:11.181
Hey, Little Miss Sad Pants
and her friend Serious Sally.

34:11.225 --> 34:12.885
How about
some nice cool mints...

34:12.927 --> 34:15.451
to turn those frowns
upside down?

34:16.864 --> 34:18.831
Do you think a nice cool mint
would help...

34:18.866 --> 34:21.458
if I shoved your head
up your ass?

34:24.536 --> 34:25.902
So what do I say?

34:25.972 --> 34:27.873
Simple, just say...

34:31.378 --> 34:33.346
I know you sacrificed
everything...

34:33.380 --> 34:35.507
relationships, dreams...

34:35.547 --> 34:37.014
your tummy, ass, and thighs...

34:37.051 --> 34:38.518
all to bring me
into this world...

34:38.551 --> 34:41.452
all so I could have tap lessons
and be in the pageant...

34:41.489 --> 34:44.013
the same one you were in,
but you know what?

34:44.058 --> 34:45.252
I'm quitting.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.817
There. Easy as pie.

34:47.862 --> 34:49.920
Oh, my God. I am so dead.

34:49.964 --> 34:50.987
Yeah, you betcha.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.330
Go on, get out!

34:53.366 --> 34:56.597
Next one in here without a pack
of Luckys in her hand dies!

34:56.636 --> 34:59.833
Yeah, sure.
You have a super day, too.

34:59.907 --> 35:01.498
Get out!

35:02.642 --> 35:05.042
Mom, look. Don't talk.

35:05.079 --> 35:08.707
First of all,
I'm not pregnant, OK?

35:08.748 --> 35:11.945
I am not letting go
until you tell me what's up.

35:11.986 --> 35:15.785
Amber, I am reaching a point
where I would kill someone...

35:15.823 --> 35:17.414
for the nicotine
under their fingernails.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.617
You hear me, Loretta?

35:18.658 --> 35:20.956
OK, OK...

35:20.995 --> 35:23.792
yesterday I got this picture...

35:23.831 --> 35:27.267
so I'm thinking about...

35:27.300 --> 35:28.767
you know...

35:28.803 --> 35:30.566
I'm gonna quit the pageant.

35:30.603 --> 35:32.070
What?

35:32.138 --> 35:33.834
Oh, excuse us, guys.

35:33.908 --> 35:36.774
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

35:36.811 --> 35:39.041
Loretta, get out of here!
Go on, get out.

35:39.078 --> 35:40.239
What's your problem?

35:40.281 --> 35:43.272
What's my problem?
Sit your skinny little ass down.

35:43.316 --> 35:44.806
Nice, Ma. Real nice.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.285
Nice mouth you got there...

35:46.319 --> 35:48.253
but I'm not going
through this again.

35:48.289 --> 35:50.518
You? You're not
going through it again?

35:50.558 --> 35:53.526
You're not the one that knows
how Jiffy Pop feels, missy.

35:53.561 --> 35:55.153
Oh, come on, Mom.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.687
First the picture of Tammy, then
Brett Clemmens, and now this?

35:57.730 --> 35:59.198
It's scary.

35:59.233 --> 36:01.359
Scary?
Let me tell you scary.

36:01.402 --> 36:03.427
Look here. Look at me.

36:03.471 --> 36:05.665
You want to look
like you've been rode hard...

36:05.738 --> 36:07.706
and put away wet
when you're my age?

36:07.775 --> 36:08.934
I'm a lifer here.

36:09.008 --> 36:10.373
Best thing
I got to look forward to...

36:10.411 --> 36:12.401
is to end up
in some decent raisin ranch...

36:12.480 --> 36:14.948
where they change me
twice a day.

36:18.486 --> 36:20.043
Honest to God, honey.

36:20.086 --> 36:23.181
If I had it to do over...

36:23.224 --> 36:25.522
I'd start walking
out of this town...

36:25.558 --> 36:27.856
the minute I could take
my first step.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.828
You know, practically...

36:29.864 --> 36:33.356
the only thing I wouldn't do
different is have you.

36:36.136 --> 36:39.537
God, I hope that's you
and not your concussion talking.

36:39.607 --> 36:40.801
It's me.

36:40.875 --> 36:45.607
I just don't want this to be
the thing that you do over.

36:45.645 --> 36:49.013
Now, this pageant's
your ticket out of here...

36:49.048 --> 36:51.710
and I know you can win.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.913
Come here.

36:53.953 --> 36:56.046
Oh, I love you much.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.580
I love you much.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.456
And you're gonna win.

36:59.492 --> 37:01.290
She's gonna win.

37:01.327 --> 37:02.488
Isn't she gonna win, Loretta?

37:02.530 --> 37:03.758
You bet.

37:03.797 --> 37:04.820
You'll see.

37:04.864 --> 37:06.991
Hell no, she ain't quitting.

37:07.033 --> 37:08.467
No. Mom said if I did...

37:08.501 --> 37:10.435
she'd look up my dad
and marry him.

37:10.471 --> 37:13.166
So, has your mom
kept your dad's life a secret?

37:13.239 --> 37:14.831
No, she never hid the fact...

37:14.909 --> 37:17.469
that my dad
picked his career over us.

37:17.545 --> 37:18.977
What did she used to say?

37:19.013 --> 37:20.639
Once a carny, always a carny.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.205
Mom still cries
when she sees a tilt-a-whirl...

37:23.249 --> 37:25.342
or a fat lady in a tube top.

37:25.386 --> 37:27.353
The Atkins fire.

37:27.388 --> 37:30.221
Foul play? Shit, no.

37:30.256 --> 37:32.156
After some extensive
investigating...

37:32.192 --> 37:35.320
we determined that it must
have been bad wiring.

37:35.361 --> 37:37.158
Bad wiring?

37:37.197 --> 37:39.665
That's the biggest
crock of shit I ever heard.

37:41.035 --> 37:43.868
What, they have a sale
on dull needles at K-Mart?

37:43.903 --> 37:46.394
I just need one more do-over.

38:04.425 --> 38:08.623
Now, we need to remember the
three most important parts...

38:08.661 --> 38:11.562
to give a really good
interview...

38:11.599 --> 38:13.327
Listen up, number one.

38:13.366 --> 38:15.231
Number one.

38:15.268 --> 38:17.736
American Teen Princesses...

38:17.770 --> 38:19.761
do not cross their legs
like streetwalkers.

38:19.807 --> 38:21.900
Excuse me,
"Miss Penthouse '98... "

38:21.976 --> 38:23.568
put your knees together.

38:23.643 --> 38:25.042
I could drive
a boat show in there.

38:25.079 --> 38:26.569
Ankles together.

38:26.646 --> 38:29.342
Hands resting
lightly on your laps.

38:29.382 --> 38:31.715
Good.
Sit up straight. Smile.

38:31.751 --> 38:33.743
All right, number two.

38:33.786 --> 38:36.949
The judges are just
as nervous as you are.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.596
So, are you about ready...

38:45.633 --> 38:48.692
to start the judging,
start the interview there?

38:52.071 --> 38:54.597
I guess I could answer that.

38:54.674 --> 38:56.108
Yeah, we're ready.

38:56.142 --> 38:59.408
So we should probably get
the young girls in here, then.

38:59.445 --> 39:02.437
You know,
to start the interviews.

39:04.018 --> 39:07.282
If you could be any tree
in the woods...

39:09.155 --> 39:10.986
what kind of tree would you be?

39:13.227 --> 39:14.352
Dogwood.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.725
Bonsai.

39:15.763 --> 39:17.093
Green?

39:17.131 --> 39:19.121
I can be any kind
of tree you want.

39:19.165 --> 39:20.861
Just give me a minute
to warm up.

39:26.874 --> 39:30.809
One with strong roots in
a community like Mount Rose...

39:30.878 --> 39:33.937
a solid Christian trunk...

39:34.013 --> 39:37.780
and long leafy branches
to provide shade...

39:37.817 --> 39:40.308
for handicapped kids
on a hot summer day.

39:40.353 --> 39:43.517
You guys know
the retard's pants are open?

39:44.958 --> 39:47.949
I don't want to see that.

39:49.362 --> 39:51.797
Who would you pick to be
the president, dead or alive?

39:52.832 --> 39:54.630
Emperor Hirohito.

39:54.667 --> 39:55.929
Brett Favre.

40:03.811 --> 40:07.645
My mother, 'cause she could
solve world hunger...

40:07.680 --> 40:10.673
with one of her blue-ribbon
rhubarb pies...

40:10.718 --> 40:13.948
create world peace
with one of her prayers...

40:13.987 --> 40:16.511
and still find time
to look beautiful...

40:16.557 --> 40:19.218
for my dad, Lester Leeman.

40:19.259 --> 40:20.749
Do you like to swim?

40:21.829 --> 40:23.854
Yeah, I love to swim.

40:23.897 --> 40:25.864
When I was in New York,
I met Greg Louganis...

40:25.899 --> 40:27.560
at one of my brother's shows.

40:41.447 --> 40:44.042
The tard's pants
are completely off.

40:48.021 --> 40:49.215
Close up shop.

40:51.724 --> 40:54.057
Are you Amber Atkins?

40:54.093 --> 40:56.254
Yes, yes, I am. Hello.

40:59.399 --> 41:01.798
Name and spell
all the United States...

41:01.835 --> 41:03.199
in alphabetical order.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.169
Seriously?

41:14.148 --> 41:16.582
Well...

41:16.616 --> 41:19.711
Alabama.

41:19.752 --> 41:22.517
A- I-a-b-a-m-a.

41:22.555 --> 41:23.955
Alaska.

41:23.990 --> 41:27.984
A- I-a-s-k-a.

41:30.130 --> 41:33.292
Arizona.

41:33.333 --> 41:36.632
A- r-i-z-o-n-a.

41:36.669 --> 41:38.330
West Virginia.

41:38.404 --> 41:42.431
W- e-s-t V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a.

41:42.509 --> 41:44.840
Wisconsin.

41:44.878 --> 41:48.574
W- i-s-c-o-n-s-i-n.

41:48.615 --> 41:49.741
Wyoming.

41:49.782 --> 41:52.751
W- y-o-m-i-n-g.

41:56.756 --> 41:59.418
Well, OK.

42:03.696 --> 42:06.494
With two weeks until
the pageant...

42:06.533 --> 42:14.030
I was practicing my talent,
finishing my costume...

42:14.107 --> 42:17.008
brushing up on current events...

42:17.043 --> 42:23.243
and running eighteen miles a day
on about four hundred calories.

42:23.283 --> 42:25.375
I was ready.

42:37.564 --> 42:39.360
Girls, couple of things.

42:39.399 --> 42:40.889
All right, very important.

42:40.934 --> 42:44.426
Gladys wants us to all go
in show order today.

42:44.471 --> 42:47.531
All right, so very important,
don't forget that.

42:49.909 --> 42:52.504
Oh, yeah, really nervous.

42:53.546 --> 42:55.480
It's been about two months.

42:56.483 --> 42:59.350
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

42:59.385 --> 43:00.910
How did you know?

43:00.954 --> 43:03.854
I meant nervous
about the pageant.

43:03.891 --> 43:07.349
Oh, nervous about the pageant.

43:08.428 --> 43:10.521
There are eight thousand
sequins...

43:10.563 --> 43:13.498
and fifteen hundred beads
on the skirt alone.

43:13.533 --> 43:16.161
My mom had Mrs. Lopez make it.

43:16.202 --> 43:19.366
She's one of my father's
many Mexican workers.

43:19.439 --> 43:22.896
He lifts them from the poverty
they know in Mexico.

43:22.976 --> 43:25.911
Yeah, all my mom's clothes
melted onto mine.

43:25.945 --> 43:29.712
Forming, like, this big
polyester meteor in our closet.

43:29.749 --> 43:32.411
But in some kind
of weird miracle...

43:32.452 --> 43:33.919
our neighbor boy Kenny Hansen...

43:33.953 --> 43:36.184
found my tap costume
on the roof of their trailer...

43:36.222 --> 43:38.713
while he was setting
coon traps for his dad.

43:38.758 --> 43:39.986
Here's the weird part.

43:40.026 --> 43:42.494
It was still on the hanger.

43:43.530 --> 43:45.724
This is my lucky bolt.

43:45.765 --> 43:48.427
They think that it fell
from a DC-10.

43:48.468 --> 43:52.062
The doctor said I was really
lucky the flat side hit me.

43:52.138 --> 43:54.971
'Cause otherwise it could have
gone right through my head.

43:55.008 --> 43:58.238
I know, I know.
Gives me the willies, too.

44:00.013 --> 44:03.380
Can we switch numbers?

44:03.416 --> 44:09.947
My cousin just had a deaf baby,
and I get to go see it.

44:09.989 --> 44:11.389
I need to go first.

44:11.424 --> 44:14.519
Yeah, sure.
It's my lucky number anyway.

44:14.561 --> 44:17.529
Diane Sawyer has number eight
at her local.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.658
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

44:22.202 --> 44:27.401
I can see what's mine now

44:28.541 --> 44:33.878
Finding out what's true

44:34.914 --> 44:40.648
Since I found you

44:40.687 --> 44:45.351
Looking through the eyes

44:45.391 --> 44:47.690
Of...

44:47.727 --> 44:49.388
I'm gonna be honest.

44:49.429 --> 44:51.556
This is a hard time for me...

44:51.598 --> 44:54.829
because this is the time
in the pageant...

44:54.868 --> 44:57.233
when you realize
that tomorrow night...

44:57.270 --> 45:00.364
all but one of these girls
is gonna walk away a loser.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.737
To be

45:01.808 --> 45:02.739
It's just really hard...

45:02.809 --> 45:05.675
for me to know
what that would feel like.

45:05.712 --> 45:07.508
It can't feel good.

45:09.516 --> 45:11.676
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

45:11.718 --> 45:13.208
Don't touch her.

45:15.355 --> 45:17.550
Don't move the body.
Don't touch the body.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.080
She could be paralyzed
from the neck down...

45:19.125 --> 45:20.353
and you wouldn't know it.

45:20.393 --> 45:21.952
Someone call nine-one-one.

45:21.995 --> 45:24.053
Don't say anything...

45:24.097 --> 45:26.724
'cause it might be
a hypnotic suggestion.

45:27.967 --> 45:29.798
Don't you get it?

45:29.836 --> 45:30.961
I was supposed to go first.

45:31.004 --> 45:33.403
I was contestant number one.

45:33.473 --> 45:36.236
That light was meant
for my head.

45:36.308 --> 45:39.278
If Jenelle hadn't
wanted to go first...

45:40.312 --> 45:42.837
I owe my life
to that deaf baby.

45:45.952 --> 45:47.579
Hey, that was your mom.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.612
She wanted you to have this.

45:52.759 --> 45:54.317
Really, Loretta?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.554
You bet.

45:57.997 --> 46:00.090
My mom wanted me to have this?

46:01.935 --> 46:02.993
Oh, shut up.

46:03.036 --> 46:05.026
I thought it might help you
get some sleep.

46:05.071 --> 46:07.404
Loretta, never have kids.

46:09.108 --> 46:12.134
Well, God love you
for thinking I still could.

46:12.212 --> 46:14.179
Your ma did want you
to have this, though...

46:14.247 --> 46:15.680
since your other one
got toasted.

46:15.714 --> 46:18.205
It's just like Diane Sawyer's!

46:19.285 --> 46:20.810
Of course, it's not a size ten.

46:20.854 --> 46:22.321
Diane was a little hippy then.

46:22.354 --> 46:23.913
- Not our girl.
- Oh, no.

46:35.535 --> 46:36.968
Pain meds.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.833
Hope this thing ends
before they do.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.603
We have excitement.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.076
Big excitement.

46:45.111 --> 46:46.305
Go, Molly!

46:46.346 --> 46:48.075
Go.

46:48.114 --> 46:50.480
Leslie Miller
kicks Teen Princess ass!

46:50.517 --> 46:52.576
Whoo! Go, Muskies!

47:09.502 --> 47:10.663
Oh, gotta go.

47:22.515 --> 47:25.041
Thank you, thank you.

47:25.084 --> 47:26.552
Oh, my.

47:26.586 --> 47:29.555
Is that for me or my gown?

47:34.227 --> 47:38.094
Welcome to the Mount Rose
American Teen Princess Pageant.

47:38.131 --> 47:40.622
While every contestant...

47:40.667 --> 47:43.294
you'll meet here tonight
is special and unique...

47:43.335 --> 47:46.328
they all have
one thing in common.

47:46.406 --> 47:51.468
They are all proud
to be an American.

48:31.618 --> 48:33.676
I chose Mount Rushmore...

48:33.720 --> 48:35.516
because to live in a country...

48:35.555 --> 48:37.352
where you can take
an ugly old mountain...

48:37.389 --> 48:40.382
and put faces on it,
faces of great Americans...

48:40.426 --> 48:43.418
who did so much to make
our country super great...

48:43.463 --> 48:46.431
well, that makes me,
Rebecca Leeman...

48:46.466 --> 48:48.491
proud to be an American.

48:48.535 --> 48:53.131
I'm Lisa Swenson, and I am proud
to be an American...

48:53.206 --> 48:55.106
because living in a country
where Lady Liberty...

48:55.140 --> 48:58.041
always keeps her flame
burning bright...

48:59.511 --> 49:03.538
She always keeps her flame
burning bright.

49:03.583 --> 49:05.982
It makes me proud
to be an American.

49:06.019 --> 49:07.145
God.

49:07.187 --> 49:09.086
The Washington Monument...

49:09.122 --> 49:11.817
Oh, yeah, baby!

49:11.858 --> 49:12.846
Makes me...

49:12.891 --> 49:16.088
Leslie Miller,
proud to be an American.

49:17.896 --> 49:20.866
Living in a country
where no matter who you are...

49:20.899 --> 49:23.892
or where you come from,
you can grow up...

49:23.937 --> 49:27.667
and become what you've always
dreamed of makes me...

49:27.740 --> 49:30.834
Amber Atkins,
proud to be an American.

49:30.909 --> 49:34.437
Atomic power makes me,
Molly Howard...

49:34.514 --> 49:36.913
proud to be an Asian-American.

49:36.950 --> 49:40.613
My uncle Phil's world's-largest
ball of twine...

49:40.653 --> 49:42.588
in Bundy, Minnesota...

49:42.622 --> 49:45.954
it makes me proud I'm American.

49:45.991 --> 49:49.428
I kind of misunderstood
the assignment.

49:53.900 --> 49:57.267
A couple of notes from
yesterday's dress rehearsal.

49:57.303 --> 49:58.668
Gladys says a couple of youse...

49:58.705 --> 49:59.966
are getting sexy
with your hips...

50:00.039 --> 50:02.201
during the physical
fitness routine.

50:02.275 --> 50:04.742
Oh, my God,
my tap costume's gone.

50:04.777 --> 50:08.179
Amber, we are not putting on
our talent costume.

50:08.213 --> 50:10.511
You need to put on
your physical fitness outfit.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.540
Let's shake a leg, ladies!

50:12.584 --> 50:15.052
It was here
before the opening number.

50:16.755 --> 50:18.314
Wait.

50:18.358 --> 50:20.689
What am I saying?

50:20.727 --> 50:23.560
I should just ask you, Becky.

50:23.595 --> 50:25.324
Where is it?

50:25.365 --> 50:26.559
What?

50:26.598 --> 50:29.089
You heard me. Where is it?

50:30.436 --> 50:33.304
If you're getting at something,
you'd better just say it.

50:33.373 --> 50:35.465
I just did.

50:35.542 --> 50:37.338
Well, then you'd better be
willing to back it up...

50:37.377 --> 50:38.809
because you're talking crazy.

50:38.845 --> 50:41.575
You bring me on some
of that snotty attitude.

50:41.613 --> 50:42.739
Bring it on!

50:42.781 --> 50:44.544
Well, as my mother says
at Sunday dinner...

50:44.584 --> 50:45.676
come and get it!

50:45.718 --> 50:47.118
I'll get it!

50:47.152 --> 50:48.278
I might even take seconds!

50:48.320 --> 50:51.084
If you want seconds,
I'll make sure you get them!

50:51.124 --> 50:52.522
Give me your stringy ass!

50:55.094 --> 50:57.062
I think that you guys
should leave.

50:57.096 --> 50:58.860
The girls are changing.
I think you should leave.

50:58.897 --> 51:00.364
All right, let's go.

51:00.400 --> 51:02.868
- I hate her!
- We all do. Let's go.

51:02.901 --> 51:04.893
Let's give a big round
of applause...

51:04.938 --> 51:07.429
for last year's
American Teen Princess...

51:07.507 --> 51:09.736
in her farewell performance.

51:09.808 --> 51:11.777
Who could ever forget
her lip-synching...

51:11.810 --> 51:15.371
to "Don't Cry Out Loud"
by Melissa Manchester?

51:15.415 --> 51:17.144
And here she is...

51:17.182 --> 51:18.911
Mary Johanson.

51:28.093 --> 51:33.532
Don't cry out loud

51:33.565 --> 51:36.194
Just keep it inside

51:36.236 --> 51:40.832
And learn how to hide
your feelings

51:40.907 --> 51:46.435
Fly high and proud

51:46.513 --> 51:49.606
And if you should fall

51:49.648 --> 51:52.173
Remember you almost

51:52.217 --> 51:57.087
Had it all

51:59.758 --> 52:01.953
All right, why don't we pick up
the stepladders...

52:01.995 --> 52:03.121
for the physical fitness number?

52:03.163 --> 52:04.289
There we go.

52:04.329 --> 52:05.729
They're wet.

52:05.764 --> 52:06.890
What?

52:06.933 --> 52:08.422
My hands are stuck.

52:09.469 --> 52:11.130
I'm kind of dizzy
from the fumes.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.399
You know what, girls?

52:12.472 --> 52:14.963
Keep them away from you so
they don't get on the outfits.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.133
There we go.

52:16.209 --> 52:18.109
Let's form a line.

52:20.380 --> 52:22.074
What kind of a mental retard...

52:22.115 --> 52:24.015
paints stepladders
right before a pageant?

52:24.049 --> 52:25.914
I'm the judge!

52:27.085 --> 52:30.350
Back, you cuddly retard.

52:30.390 --> 52:31.720
Go, Hank!

52:31.758 --> 52:34.226
It's OK.

52:34.259 --> 52:35.385
My dress is fine.

52:36.528 --> 52:39.463
All right, so...

52:39.499 --> 52:41.625
our other judges are...

52:41.668 --> 52:43.226
Jean Kangas...

52:43.268 --> 52:44.668
and John Dough...

52:44.703 --> 52:47.605
Opening number looked good...

52:47.674 --> 52:51.109
solid, but now you're going
to have to actually dance.

52:51.176 --> 52:54.613
So, here, put a dab of this
on the old choppers, ladies.

52:54.681 --> 52:56.375
It'll help you smile...

52:56.416 --> 52:58.406
and when they're looking
at your teeth, God willing...

52:58.450 --> 53:00.316
they won't be looking
at your feet.

54:21.099 --> 54:23.124
Hurry up.

54:23.168 --> 54:24.567
OK, I think we all got some.

54:24.604 --> 54:26.231
Just take it off.

54:26.306 --> 54:28.706
Here, I didn't...

54:28.740 --> 54:31.209
I think it went really well.

54:31.244 --> 54:32.871
Don't go in the bathroom.

54:32.946 --> 54:34.845
Tess blew chunks all over.

54:34.881 --> 54:37.576
She ate a really large dinner.

54:37.617 --> 54:39.846
Maybe she should've
shoved that lucky bolt...

54:39.886 --> 54:41.376
down her throat for dessert.

54:42.554 --> 54:45.580
And the winner
of the spirit award goes to...

54:45.657 --> 54:49.149
I'd like to take you back
seventeen years...

54:49.194 --> 54:52.596
when a peanut farmer
was in the White House...

54:52.631 --> 54:54.896
a group of boys
calling themselves Queen...

54:54.933 --> 54:56.696
topped the record charts...

54:56.735 --> 54:58.727
and Gladys Leeman
was Gladys Wood...

54:59.872 --> 55:03.467
and she was Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

55:10.649 --> 55:13.084
Thank you very much.

55:13.118 --> 55:17.579
You know, seventeen years ago,
I won the talent contest...

55:17.624 --> 55:18.818
by sewing...

55:19.826 --> 55:21.088
these culottes...

55:21.126 --> 55:23.151
Butterick pattern
seven-four-three-two.

55:23.196 --> 55:25.096
And can you believe it?

55:25.130 --> 55:26.291
They still fit.

55:26.331 --> 55:29.199
She had a big ass then,
she's got a big ass now.

55:29.234 --> 55:31.702
Our next contestant is ready,
so let's welcome her...

55:31.738 --> 55:33.170
Tess Weinhaus.

55:38.410 --> 55:40.140
Yeah, it's just gone.

55:42.414 --> 55:43.540
I mean...

55:43.583 --> 55:46.710
I just wanna tap, you know?

55:46.753 --> 55:51.382
I'm not saying I'm the best
or that I'd even win, but...

55:51.423 --> 55:53.550
shouldn't I at least
get a chance to compete?

55:53.593 --> 55:57.393
The beagle is known
for its howl.

56:01.401 --> 56:04.028
I just wanted my mom
to see me dance.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.800
Amber, Amber, come here.

56:06.873 --> 56:09.501
Please. I got so much Vaseline
on my teeth...

56:09.575 --> 56:11.600
I'm going to be smiling
for a year.

56:11.678 --> 56:13.236
No. Here.

56:13.312 --> 56:14.573
It's nothing special...

56:14.614 --> 56:17.606
but talent like yours doesn't
need to hide behind sequins.

56:17.649 --> 56:19.082
Oh, Miss K.

56:19.117 --> 56:20.449
Oh, look.

56:20.485 --> 56:25.855
But none can compare
to the greatest bark of all...

56:25.892 --> 56:28.156
the German shepherd.

56:30.697 --> 56:34.258
Aw, hell, go out there
and kick some Leeman ass.

56:35.501 --> 56:37.764
Not so hard, sweetie.
I heard something snap.

56:37.804 --> 56:39.668
Roll him over!

56:39.738 --> 56:40.706
Lay him flat!

56:41.740 --> 56:43.470
Pin his shoulders!

56:43.543 --> 56:45.066
To the mat!

56:46.111 --> 56:47.670
Roll him over! Lay him flat!

56:47.746 --> 56:49.715
Pin their shoulders
to the mat!

56:49.781 --> 56:51.339
Go...

56:51.383 --> 56:52.749
Muskies! Yeah!

57:02.861 --> 57:03.851
Fade in.

57:05.130 --> 57:08.464
The year... 2024.

57:10.068 --> 57:11.797
Planet... Earth.

57:13.005 --> 57:14.972
The question
on everyone's mind?

57:16.275 --> 57:17.867
What is...

57:17.944 --> 57:19.502
Soylent Green?

57:24.516 --> 57:27.110
Mrs. Clark, why are you
doing this to me?

57:27.152 --> 57:29.121
Why are you pretending
you don't know what's going on?

57:29.154 --> 57:31.179
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am.

57:31.224 --> 57:32.690
But you know the rules.

57:32.724 --> 57:34.659
All talent costumes
have to be OK'd...

57:34.693 --> 57:36.059
by Gladys before the pageant.

57:36.094 --> 57:37.652
But doesn't someone
taking your costume...

57:37.696 --> 57:40.164
so you can't compete
overrule that rule?

57:40.199 --> 57:42.258
Amber, I'm sorry.
I don't make up the rules.

57:42.301 --> 57:43.824
Oh, this...

57:43.870 --> 57:45.461
this is bullshit!

57:45.505 --> 57:48.667
Amber Atkins, that is not
American Teen Princess language.

57:48.740 --> 57:51.709
Good, because this isn't an
American Teen Princess Pageant.

57:51.743 --> 57:53.735
This is... this is...

57:53.812 --> 57:55.781
this is Nazi Germany!

57:59.551 --> 58:01.280
Where do they get this stuff?

58:09.428 --> 58:11.486
I'm wearing this tap costume.

58:11.531 --> 58:13.897
I'm going to do
my talent tonight.

58:13.932 --> 58:15.161
Oh, really?

58:15.200 --> 58:16.690
I don't think so.

58:20.173 --> 58:22.437
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news...

58:22.508 --> 58:25.170
but you know the rules state
that a costume has to be OK'd...

58:25.244 --> 58:27.234
at least a week in advance.

58:27.312 --> 58:30.840
I couldn't let you go out there
in that skimpy little thing.

58:30.883 --> 58:32.440
We've got kids in the audience.

58:32.484 --> 58:34.509
I hope you understand.

58:34.554 --> 58:36.112
But you... I mean...

58:36.154 --> 58:38.714
It's not my fault. Please.

58:38.757 --> 58:40.851
I didn't do anything wrong.

58:40.893 --> 58:43.384
I know the truth, that's why.

58:43.428 --> 58:44.760
I must say...

58:44.796 --> 58:46.957
Soylent Green...

58:46.999 --> 58:49.057
is people!

58:52.771 --> 58:54.672
Now, that's my cue.

59:34.813 --> 59:37.577
I just wanted to compete.

59:39.384 --> 59:42.718
I can't believe
this is happening.

59:42.754 --> 59:45.280
I can't believe she said...

59:53.832 --> 59:54.958
Here.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.490
Here? What?

59:56.535 --> 59:58.093
My jacket.

59:58.136 --> 01:00:00.537
Take it, because I got
my costume OK'd a month ago...

01:00:00.606 --> 01:00:02.198
before the pageant.
You can wear it.

01:00:02.275 --> 01:00:03.741
Put it on.

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:04.901
Oh, wow.

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:06.671
Lisa, I don't think
you should do this.

01:00:06.712 --> 01:00:08.475
They're never going to let you
perform naked. I asked.

01:00:08.514 --> 01:00:10.674
Shut up, you guys.

01:00:10.716 --> 01:00:13.480
Listen, Amber...

01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:16.316
I'm not going to win.

01:00:16.355 --> 01:00:18.915
And let's be honest, the family
only needs one Liza...

01:00:18.957 --> 01:00:21.756
and Peter's got
much better legs than me, OK?

01:00:21.793 --> 01:00:23.158
Your parents will kill you.

01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:25.890
Ah, come on.
I love them...

01:00:25.932 --> 01:00:29.526
but they only had me because
Peter needed that kidney.

01:00:35.207 --> 01:00:36.332
Thank you.

01:00:39.878 --> 01:00:41.004
Now...

01:00:41.046 --> 01:00:42.605
it is with overwhelming pride...

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:45.242
that I introduce to you
contestant number six...

01:00:45.284 --> 01:00:48.150
who is also the president of her
class two years running...

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.712
an honor roll student,
and the new president...

01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:52.985
of the Lutheran Sisterhood
Gun Club.

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.252
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:56.591
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

01:01:04.403 --> 01:01:05.926
You know what?

01:01:05.971 --> 01:01:07.461
The rumors are true.

01:01:08.574 --> 01:01:12.031
I do have a special fella
in my life...

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:15.578
and if nobody minds...

01:01:15.614 --> 01:01:19.345
I'd like to sing a little song
just for him.

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:26.224
You're just too good

01:01:26.258 --> 01:01:27.417
To be true

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.255
Can't take my eyes

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:32.355
Off of you

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.524
Bullshit.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.000
You'd be like heaven

01:01:36.034 --> 01:01:38.059
To touch

01:01:38.103 --> 01:01:39.833
I wanna hold you

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.736
So much

01:01:42.841 --> 01:01:44.399
At long last

01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:47.673
Love has arrived

01:01:47.713 --> 01:01:50.204
And I thank God

01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:51.441
I'm alive

01:01:52.951 --> 01:01:55.317
You're just too good

01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:57.344
To be true

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:00.086
Can't take my eyes

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.592
Off of you

01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:05.252
I love you, baby

01:02:05.297 --> 01:02:06.957
And if it's quite all right

01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:09.057
I need you, baby

01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:11.296
To warm the lonely night

01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:13.964
I love you, baby

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:16.064
Trust in me when I say

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:18.667
Lisa, come on, you're next.

01:02:18.744 --> 01:02:20.302
Nah, I quit.

01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:23.074
And since my costume was OK'd
a month ago...

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:24.274
I'm giving it to Amber.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:30.444
Let me love you, baby

01:02:30.489 --> 01:02:33.423
Let me love you

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.074
Oh, boy,
I'd hate to follow that act.

01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:53.806
The voice of an angel, that one.

01:02:59.585 --> 01:03:02.747
I have just been notified
that contestant number seven...

01:03:02.788 --> 01:03:05.756
Lisa Swenson has dropped out
of the pageant.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.455
I know,
but these things happen...

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.931
and we still have one more
contestant... number eight.

01:03:13.966 --> 01:03:15.194
Amber Atkins.

01:04:50.028 --> 01:04:51.997
Thank you.

01:05:05.878 --> 01:05:06.844
Well...

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.248
The time has finally come...

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:15.079
where we say good-bye
to the judges...

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:19.146
so that they can go off and make
the toughest decision...

01:05:19.191 --> 01:05:20.385
of their lives.

01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:28.031
So, who gets the crown?

01:05:28.066 --> 01:05:29.260
How are you going
to figure this all out?

01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:31.861
Well, you know, we'll...

01:05:31.904 --> 01:05:34.531
compare scores
and figure out a winner...

01:05:34.606 --> 01:05:37.007
because, I mean, we don't know
who the winner is yet.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:40.011
I mean, I have no idea
who Jean picked...

01:05:40.044 --> 01:05:41.603
or Harold.

01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:43.146
- No.
- No idea.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:47.384
I know who the winner is.

01:05:47.418 --> 01:05:49.181
I know who the winner...
Harold.

01:05:49.221 --> 01:05:50.950
I know who the winner is.

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.389
That's it.

01:05:52.423 --> 01:05:56.417
You shut your goddamn mouth,
you goddamn retard!

01:05:56.461 --> 01:05:59.453
I've had your shit
for two weeks now!

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:00.522
Come on.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.532
Back off, college boy!
Now listen!

01:06:06.238 --> 01:06:09.206
Hank can't help it if he's born
crazier than a shit-house rat!

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:12.972
For fuck's sake, why didn't you
leave him with a sitter?

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:19.179
Nice, John.

01:06:19.218 --> 01:06:20.446
That's real nice.

01:06:20.485 --> 01:06:23.319
You know the baby-sitter's dead.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.492
So...

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:31.461
Anyone talk to Jenelle lately?

01:06:31.496 --> 01:06:34.193
Oh, yeah. I brought her
some flowers this morning.

01:06:34.233 --> 01:06:36.633
Yeah. She's in the room
next to my mom.

01:06:36.668 --> 01:06:38.795
Oh, she's super happy.

01:06:38.836 --> 01:06:40.064
She's happy?

01:06:40.138 --> 01:06:42.369
Oh, the blow to her head
made her deaf.

01:06:42.441 --> 01:06:43.600
Oh, God.

01:06:43.675 --> 01:06:45.700
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, that's great.

01:06:45.777 --> 01:06:47.643
She's so happy.

01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:51.044
Jesus Christ!

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:54.018
What are they doing, letting
the retard count the votes?

01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:56.850
Ladies, it's time.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:18.607
Welcome back, everybody...

01:07:18.644 --> 01:07:19.735
and judges.

01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:21.836
Oh, gosh.

01:07:21.914 --> 01:07:24.780
We are so darn close
to that moment...

01:07:24.816 --> 01:07:27.411
we have all been waiting for.

01:07:27.452 --> 01:07:30.285
And now, our second runner-up...

01:07:30.322 --> 01:07:32.619
and winner
of a fifty-dollar scholarship...

01:07:32.658 --> 01:07:36.025
for the vo-tech
of her choice is...

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.590
Leslie Miller.

01:07:44.736 --> 01:07:46.294
You rule, Leslie!

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.181
Envelope, please.

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:07.682
Our next prize, a seventy-five-
dollar scholarship...

01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:10.751
will be awarded
to the first runner-up.

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.889
The first runner-up is...

01:08:17.236 --> 01:08:19.032
Amber Atkins.

01:08:45.464 --> 01:08:49.058
And now, finally the moment...

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.091
that I know
I've been waiting for.

01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:53.468
With a scholarship
of five hundred dollars...

01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:56.974
courtesy Leeman Furniture,
and an all-expense-paid trip...

01:08:57.009 --> 01:09:00.206
next weekend, when she will be
competing for the title...

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:01.644
of Sarah Rose Cosmetics...

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.613
Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:12.715
Our new...

01:09:12.758 --> 01:09:16.421
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess is...

01:09:17.962 --> 01:09:19.692
contestant number...

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.428
You know what?
It's my daughter...

01:09:22.466 --> 01:09:24.959
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

01:09:38.282 --> 01:09:40.341
Oh, thank you so much.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.819
Bitch.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.102
Here she is

01:10:05.177 --> 01:10:06.610
Our Mount Rose

01:10:06.645 --> 01:10:09.112
American Teen Princess

01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:11.274
Look at her

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:13.477
Doesn't she look fine?

01:10:13.519 --> 01:10:16.783
Our heart swells big

01:10:16.822 --> 01:10:19.221
As we look at her

01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:20.451
Our Mount Rose

01:10:20.491 --> 01:10:25.155
American Teen Princess

01:10:25.197 --> 01:10:26.788
One, two, three.

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.800
- You got her there?
- Yeah, I got her.

01:10:29.835 --> 01:10:32.269
We was robbed. We was robbed.

01:10:32.304 --> 01:10:34.635
It's OK. They're just
giving her a ride back.

01:10:34.705 --> 01:10:37.300
She almost blew out of Loretta's
pickup on the way over.

01:10:37.376 --> 01:10:38.843
Thank God for bungee cords.

01:10:40.112 --> 01:10:42.137
I got second runner-up.

01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:43.579
I got second place.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.412
- Third.
- Huh?

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:47.145
- Third.
- Bye.

01:10:53.392 --> 01:10:56.759
Are you disappointed
about not winning?

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.388
Yeah, well, no.

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:04.629
At least I got to compete,
and my mom got to see me dance.

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.161
I guess number eight
only worked for Diane Sawyer.

01:11:07.239 --> 01:11:08.672
Oh, stop.

01:11:08.706 --> 01:11:09.799
Let's go home.

01:11:09.875 --> 01:11:11.365
I'll let you drive.

01:11:13.344 --> 01:11:14.572
I hope it was worth it.

01:11:14.613 --> 01:11:16.603
No, Dad, it was worth it.

01:11:16.682 --> 01:11:18.012
Amber should've won.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.209
I tell you one thing...

01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:20.774
Peter never would've pulled
a shenanigan like that.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.083
Well, you know what, Dad?

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.112
You know what? Peter's gay.

01:11:26.525 --> 01:11:27.684
Gay!

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:30.487
What?

01:11:32.064 --> 01:11:33.223
So, Becky, how does it feel?

01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:34.755
Oh, well...

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.530
I mean,
it's all happening so fast.

01:11:37.568 --> 01:11:39.662
I'm so excited.

01:11:39.705 --> 01:11:42.435
I mean, I won.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:46.273
I'm the winner,
and I'm going to state.

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:49.507
She's the winner,
and we're going to state.

01:11:49.548 --> 01:11:50.844
What a surprise.

01:11:50.882 --> 01:11:52.610
Gladys Leeman's finally
going to go to state...

01:11:52.651 --> 01:11:54.117
and she'll probably
ride on Becky's ass...

01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:55.778
all the way to nationals, too.

01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:57.811
Wonder how she's going
to fix that one.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.153
Are you ladies going
to the parade?

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:03.058
Nah. I think I'm, like,
due or something.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.844
Beautiful as a whore's ass
today, huh, boys?

01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:30.617
Do you need help
with the cooler?

01:12:51.008 --> 01:12:54.001
See, Gladys had me get that
special-made from Mexico...

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.273
in case Becky won.

01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:57.247
You know, I do a lot
of business down there...

01:12:57.281 --> 01:12:59.273
always offer
to pay them off in tacos.

01:13:00.651 --> 01:13:02.209
Oh, they love that.

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:03.550
Keep on moving through.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:08.284
Let's get this straight
right now.

01:13:08.326 --> 01:13:09.987
We wouldn't have been
late at all if not for you.

01:13:10.027 --> 01:13:13.088
I want to have the big bag
of little doughnuts.

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:14.257
You get nothing, Hank.

01:13:14.298 --> 01:13:16.596
I want to eat a big bag
of little doughnuts.

01:13:16.635 --> 01:13:18.660
There's your paint can.

01:13:18.704 --> 01:13:20.227
The next time you drink
window cleaner...

01:13:20.272 --> 01:13:22.501
I'm just going to
leave it in you.

01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:28.544
My pants are...

01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:46.626
You rule!

01:14:01.379 --> 01:14:02.436
Rebecca Ann Leeman.

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:05.211
You are the one
that wanted this.

01:14:05.249 --> 01:14:06.443
Now get up there.

01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:09.579
I don't care if you have to ride
this thing sidesaddle.

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.746
Get up there.

01:14:10.788 --> 01:14:13.314
It smells funny... like gasoline.

01:14:13.357 --> 01:14:16.019
Everything smells
like that in Mexico.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.858
My dress will reek, Mother.

01:14:17.895 --> 01:14:19.260
You listen to me now, missy.

01:14:19.297 --> 01:14:20.991
This thing cost your dad
a pretty penny...

01:14:21.032 --> 01:14:22.624
so you get your ass up there.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:25.464
And show me some teeth.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.562
Love you, baby.

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.012
You rule!

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.346
Stop it!

01:14:43.387 --> 01:14:46.049
You are a bad kid!

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.665
You rule!

01:15:08.679 --> 01:15:10.772
If I die from these fumes...

01:15:10.816 --> 01:15:12.806
you'll make sure and cover up
the hickeys on my neck?

01:15:15.319 --> 01:15:18.084
And the bite marks on my ears.

01:15:18.122 --> 01:15:19.612
Yeah, sure.

01:15:19.658 --> 01:15:23.560
And I know it won't show,
but on my inner thighs...

01:15:23.594 --> 01:15:25.028
Yes, Leslie, OK.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.655
Help!

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:39.039
OK, I designed the float.

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:45.640
And what's going to happen here
is that this is going to look...

01:15:45.683 --> 01:15:49.346
like a glistening lake
beneath the swan.

01:15:50.521 --> 01:15:51.886
We need more bars.

01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:53.184
This is... What?

01:15:53.225 --> 01:15:54.419
Enid ate a whole pan.

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:55.823
She can't do anything
by herself.

01:15:57.295 --> 01:15:59.525
This is exactly
how I pictured it...

01:15:59.564 --> 01:16:01.395
Choking on swan gas.

01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:05.727
Oh, great.

01:16:14.078 --> 01:16:15.545
Oh, my God.

01:16:18.683 --> 01:16:20.913
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:22.078
Oh, my God.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.644
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

01:16:37.935 --> 01:16:40.403
Oh, my baby!

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.234
Oh, my God!

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.968
The swan ate my baby!

01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:50.472
Becky, baby, get up!

01:16:50.514 --> 01:16:52.846
We got to go to state!

01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:57.345
Gladys, let her go.

01:16:57.388 --> 01:16:58.549
No. She's not getting up.

01:16:58.589 --> 01:17:01.183
We got to...
Get off of me, you cow!

01:17:04.528 --> 01:17:07.396
What are you looking at, huh?

01:17:07.431 --> 01:17:10.128
A whole goddamned town
full of losers...

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.760
that's what I'm looking at!

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:15.131
And you...

01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:18.572
You piece of shit trailer trash!

01:17:18.609 --> 01:17:21.373
That should've been you
in there!

01:17:21.412 --> 01:17:23.710
Damn it, I should've killed you
when I had a chance...

01:17:23.748 --> 01:17:25.773
just like your little friend!

01:17:25.816 --> 01:17:30.311
Tammy was one crispy critter
up on that thresher!

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:32.983
Ding! Fries are up!

01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:35.592
Stop it! Stop it!

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.626
Take it easy.

01:17:43.668 --> 01:17:45.464
Let go of me!

01:17:45.503 --> 01:17:46.901
Oh, my God, it's "Cops. "

01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:48.461
He sells reproductions!

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:51.509
His furniture's as fake
as my orgasms.

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:53.009
Hey, how you doing?

01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:54.511
Hey. What's up, Scott?

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.173
You remember Bruce, right?

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:58.682
Bruce, that's Roy.
Roy, Bruce.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:03.881
And that's why, dear Lord,
it's with such great sorrow...

01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:06.550
we turn over to you
this young woman...

01:18:06.591 --> 01:18:08.889
whose dream of riding
on a giant swan...

01:18:08.926 --> 01:18:11.157
has brought about
her untimely death.

01:18:11.195 --> 01:18:16.725
Maybe it's your way
of telling us to buy American.

01:18:17.768 --> 01:18:19.030
That's right.

01:18:20.805 --> 01:18:22.705
As acting president...

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.936
of the Mount Rose
Civil Servettes...

01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:26.637
it is my duty...

01:18:26.711 --> 01:18:32.308
to make you Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

01:18:34.485 --> 01:18:36.454
Turn around for the picture.

01:18:36.487 --> 01:18:37.477
You look good.

01:18:41.492 --> 01:18:43.290
What is wrong with you?

01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:44.453
I don't know.

01:18:44.495 --> 01:18:46.054
I didn't wanna win like this.

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:47.961
You stop right there.

01:18:47.999 --> 01:18:49.466
You are a good person.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.968
Good things happen
to good people.

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:53.129
Really?

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:55.661
No, it's pure bullshit, sweetie.

01:18:55.706 --> 01:18:58.471
You're lucky as hell,
so you might as well enjoy it.

01:18:58.543 --> 01:19:00.169
Let's get you a root-beer float.

01:19:00.244 --> 01:19:02.406
You guys want some shots?
I'm buying.

01:19:03.414 --> 01:19:06.873
I never liked her,
but she didn't deserve...

01:19:06.918 --> 01:19:09.386
to die in the belly
of a swan like that.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.255
The whole thing's just kinda
sad and lame at the same time.

01:19:15.426 --> 01:19:17.395
This came for you, sweetie.

01:19:17.428 --> 01:19:19.056
Hi, guys.

01:19:19.096 --> 01:19:20.893
It's from the state!

01:19:20.932 --> 01:19:22.422
Yeah. Open it up.

01:19:23.434 --> 01:19:25.902
It's all the stuff I get to do.

01:19:26.938 --> 01:19:28.268
OK, let's see.

01:19:29.507 --> 01:19:32.943
We get a personal consultation
with a makeup artist.

01:19:34.145 --> 01:19:37.113
Oh, there'll be
a choreographer to the stars.

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:38.615
- Choreographer.
- The stars.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.117
Oh, my God.

01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.948
No way. Oh, my God.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:45.454
For Christ's sakes,
spit it out, Amber.

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:48.458
We'll be staying overnight at...

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.289
the Airport Howard Johnson!

01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:51.795
Right by the airport!

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:52.955
Oh, Amber!

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:54.965
God, that's so great!

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.969
Oh, crap. I only got
four weeks to practice.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.469
Let's go, let's go!
Right now!

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:01.631
I'm gonna call your mom.

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:34.697
All right, say, "airport hotel. "

01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:35.739
Airport hotel!

01:20:35.772 --> 01:20:37.741
Coffee and doughnuts.

01:20:41.612 --> 01:20:43.581
Yeah, why don't you
take a picture?

01:20:43.614 --> 01:20:44.582
It lasts longer.

01:20:44.615 --> 01:20:45.674
Loretta, don't do that.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:47.081
All right. I'm sorry.
They're just staring.

01:20:47.118 --> 01:20:48.585
I gotta work with these girls.

01:20:48.619 --> 01:20:49.780
OK, I'm sorry.

01:21:16.547 --> 01:21:18.014
And you are...

01:21:18.049 --> 01:21:20.517
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:22.543
Funny, you don't look dead.

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:28.359
- OK, ladies!
- Girls, come on.

01:21:28.392 --> 01:21:31.020
Ladies, listen up.
I'm Colleen Douglas.

01:21:31.062 --> 01:21:34.361
And this raven beauty
on my right is Terry Macy.

01:21:34.398 --> 01:21:35.559
Hi there.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.194
And we're your Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

01:21:38.236 --> 01:21:39.497
state board.

01:21:39.537 --> 01:21:40.867
That's right.

01:21:40.905 --> 01:21:43.702
We're also the cofounders of
the Minnesota Modeling Academy.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:45.571
Yep. And you can get
your applications...

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:47.077
over here at the tiki bar...

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.079
and we will wave the
fifty-dollar application fee...

01:21:49.112 --> 01:21:51.580
if you list a friend
and put down her address.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:54.247
So...

01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:55.444
you're cute.

01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:57.819
Oh, I see you're married.

01:21:57.854 --> 01:22:01.255
If you catch this in your mouth,
I'll give you a present.

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:03.156
All right? Open wide.

01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:05.958
Oh, God, you got that
on the first try.

01:22:05.997 --> 01:22:07.964
Come here.

01:22:07.999 --> 01:22:09.830
Oh, you are cute.

01:22:09.866 --> 01:22:11.458
OK, due to budgetary
cutbacks...

01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:12.968
And the fact...

01:22:13.004 --> 01:22:14.971
that the national didn't
cough up a goddamn nickel...

01:22:15.039 --> 01:22:16.836
You won't be staying overnight.

01:22:16.908 --> 01:22:18.465
So everybody pay attention.

01:22:18.543 --> 01:22:21.273
You've got about eight hours
till showtime.

01:22:21.312 --> 01:22:23.041
Remember to count, ladies.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.016
Cross on the left
and arms up on eight.

01:22:26.049 --> 01:22:28.075
On the beat, on the beat,
on the beat!

01:22:28.119 --> 01:22:30.610
Keep on. Keep moving it.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:32.122
Come on, Miss Forest Lake...

01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:33.953
take that stick out of your ass
or I will!

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:35.652
All right. Very nice.

01:22:35.693 --> 01:22:36.887
Now come on.

01:22:36.928 --> 01:22:38.485
Mom's out here in the front row.

01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:39.654
Come on. Sell it!

01:22:39.697 --> 01:22:41.561
That's very nice.

01:22:41.599 --> 01:22:42.895
Remember, figure eights, ladies.

01:22:42.934 --> 01:22:49.362
I can sum up our entire
philosophy with this glass.

01:22:49.439 --> 01:22:51.533
I can look at it and see...

01:22:51.609 --> 01:22:53.200
it's half full.

01:22:53.277 --> 01:22:55.939
Which in the beauty pageant biz
means...

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.571
"Where the hell is my waiter?!"

01:22:57.615 --> 01:22:59.741
- Marco!
- Polo!

01:22:59.784 --> 01:23:02.946
Stop with the friggin' Marco
Polo, or I'll come over there...

01:23:02.987 --> 01:23:04.545
and rip your
fat little heads off!

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:16.492
Miss Burnsville,
you're up next.

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.507
I have a little
secret weapon of my own.

01:23:25.543 --> 01:23:26.669
Don't tell anyone.

01:23:39.489 --> 01:23:41.458
Oh, I don't eat shellfish.

01:23:41.491 --> 01:23:43.187
Ma always says,
"Don't eat anything...

01:23:43.226 --> 01:23:44.693
"that can carry its house
around with it.

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.719
"Who knows the last time
it's been cleaned?"

01:23:46.763 --> 01:23:48.732
I've done
about thirty-five pageants.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.529
I guess my most memorable one...

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:54.037
would have to be
Miss Teen America 1995...

01:23:54.105 --> 01:23:55.572
'cause it was in Vegas.

01:23:56.606 --> 01:23:58.234
And my roommate did Adam West.

01:23:58.309 --> 01:24:01.574
She said he was so horny.

01:24:13.925 --> 01:24:15.153
Oh, my God.

01:24:32.542 --> 01:24:34.942
I should just go home now.

01:24:36.047 --> 01:24:37.514
OK, real good.

01:24:37.547 --> 01:24:39.014
One suggestion, sweetie.

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:41.677
Why don't you hike up your skirt
a little bit then, OK?

01:24:42.719 --> 01:24:43.880
Next!

01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:48.024
Oh, my God.

01:24:48.059 --> 01:24:49.526
I gotta go!

01:24:49.559 --> 01:24:52.027
You better do something
about those nerves, sweetie.

01:24:52.063 --> 01:24:53.530
Thirty million people
aren't gonna wait for you...

01:24:53.563 --> 01:24:55.030
while you run to the john.

01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:56.533
That's true.

01:24:58.735 --> 01:25:01.102
Will somebody
get a mop and a bucket?

01:25:01.172 --> 01:25:04.266
Today, a beauty pageant
turned ugly.

01:25:07.377 --> 01:25:08.743
Did I win?

01:25:08.779 --> 01:25:10.440
Honey, if I was a good lover...

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.505
Oh, for crap sake.

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:14.017
A salmonella dysentery
outbreak...

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:16.712
now traced to improperly
refrigerated shellfish...

01:25:16.753 --> 01:25:19.314
was believed to be the cause.

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:27.859
Oh, my God.
Do you think they heard us?

01:25:27.899 --> 01:25:31.459
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Call an ambulance!

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:32.627
An ambulance?

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:34.467
Call a priest,
for Christ's sake!

01:25:35.872 --> 01:25:37.966
Joining us now
is David Richardson...

01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:41.478
a member of a documentary crew
filming the pageant.

01:25:41.546 --> 01:25:44.173
He was there
when tragedy struck.

01:25:45.383 --> 01:25:48.511
Fuckin' beauty queens
blowin' chunks everywhere.

01:25:48.553 --> 01:25:52.352
I've never seen anything
like it before, and...

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.687
I live in L.A.

01:25:53.723 --> 01:25:55.055
Oh, hey, Ed.

01:25:56.059 --> 01:25:57.526
That's our sound guy.

01:25:57.562 --> 01:25:59.529
Could you tell us anything
about the controversy?

01:25:59.564 --> 01:26:01.031
Is there a controversy here?

01:26:01.064 --> 01:26:02.430
Has there been sabotage?

01:26:02.466 --> 01:26:03.399
Wait a minute.

01:26:03.433 --> 01:26:05.402
While we haven't
ruled out sabotage...

01:26:05.435 --> 01:26:07.096
from neighboring
state pageants...

01:26:07.138 --> 01:26:08.799
Iowa, Wisconsin, South Dakota.

01:26:08.873 --> 01:26:10.135
Yeah, that's right.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.175
Ohio.

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:13.176
That bitch from Wisconsin.

01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:14.199
All right then.

01:26:14.277 --> 01:26:16.439
The important thing
is we have a winner!

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.641
- Yes, we do.
- OK.

01:26:17.682 --> 01:26:19.945
The Minnesota Modeling Academy
is proud to present...

01:26:19.984 --> 01:26:21.781
Along with Sarah Rose
Cosmetics...

01:26:21.818 --> 01:26:22.944
Amber Atkins...

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:27.456
The new Minnesota
American Teen Princess!

01:26:27.491 --> 01:26:28.652
That's Amber Atkins.

01:26:28.693 --> 01:26:30.660
That's right.
From Mount Rose.

01:26:30.695 --> 01:26:33.595
Amber, how do you feel?

01:26:33.631 --> 01:26:35.097
Well, I...

01:26:35.131 --> 01:26:37.464
I feel like I need
to take a shower.

01:26:38.636 --> 01:26:40.467
Honey, is this the best day
of your life?

01:26:40.504 --> 01:26:43.496
Yeah. I wish
my mom was here, though.

01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:45.008
Wave hi to her.

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:46.508
Hi, Mom.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:48.043
Hey, you hear that?

01:26:48.079 --> 01:26:49.546
Hi, monkey.

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.377
I got some.

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:55.884
Uh-huh. No, no. Gosh, no.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.184
You know, I still don't
want to be on camera.

01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:00.519
I just wanna say...

01:27:00.558 --> 01:27:02.889
that little bitch
better watch her back...

01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:04.554
at the nationals...

01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:07.062
'cause I am making friends
on the inside.

01:27:07.098 --> 01:27:09.225
Yeah. Darn good friends.

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.394
Friends who have friends
on the outside.

01:27:11.434 --> 01:27:13.596
Get your sweet ass
off the phone, Cinnamon.

01:27:13.638 --> 01:27:14.797
Gotta go.

01:27:16.107 --> 01:27:17.073
Oh, yeah.

01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:18.575
I just can't believe it.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.439
I'm Minnesota's
American Teen Princess.

01:27:20.478 --> 01:27:22.445
Our baby's going to nationals.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.414
Lincoln, Alabama, look out!

01:27:25.982 --> 01:27:28.213
I'm gonna be on TV
just like Diane Sawyer.

01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:33.957
Annette, just use your hand.

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:35.582
They told me to practice.

01:27:48.873 --> 01:27:50.363
I did it.

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.964
OK. Ready?

01:27:52.043 --> 01:27:55.011
Here's the signal I'm gonna give
Mom when I'm on TV.

01:27:56.881 --> 01:27:59.315
My little Carol Burnett.

01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:00.816
Here she is...

01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:03.114
Minnesota's
American Teen Princess...

01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:04.621
and soon to be...

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:08.146
the next America's
American Teen Princess...

01:28:08.191 --> 01:28:10.022
our little Amber.

01:28:32.148 --> 01:28:34.447
So after Frank
dusts the crops...

01:28:34.484 --> 01:28:37.454
he's taking her
to Lincoln, Alabama.

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.397
Come on out...

01:31:02.432 --> 01:31:05.960
you little blond piece
of trailer-park trash!

01:31:11.374 --> 01:31:14.468
We're here in the sixth hour
of a shootout between...

01:31:20.717 --> 01:31:22.184
This is Amber Atkins...

01:31:22.218 --> 01:31:25.518
reporting live from
the Food Shack for KRLH News.

01:31:25.555 --> 01:31:27.524
One of our reporters
has just been shot.

01:31:27.557 --> 01:31:30.550
Paramedics are working on her
right now...

01:31:33.898 --> 01:31:35.489
I'm Peter Atchison.

01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:37.000
And I'm Amber Atkins.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:39.195
For WAZB News, good night.
