<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:12.054
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.057
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:18.352
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.650
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:41.500
Hey, welcome to Bonnie's
29th birthday party.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.795
I ca... I can't keep this up.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.296
She's 46.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.049
Here, we brought you guys
an orchid from Trader Joe's,

00:49.132 --> 00:51.718
because we don't know
or care about any of your interests.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.641
Well, I put together some videos
for Bonnie's party.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.476
Here we are on our honeymoon.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.403
Yeah, Cabo was great.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.738
We even went back
for our 10th anniversary.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.879
Better wrap it up, honey,
tide's coming in.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.547
Well, let's break for presents,

01:28.630 --> 01:30.966
but after that,
I'll show you Susie's birth video,

01:31.049 --> 01:34.469
and I'll tell you, she fell out of there
like an orange out of an old dress sock.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.890
Ugh, I have to text Rupert
what a train wreck this is.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.560
Hey, I want real things.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.861
Kind of weird they're keeping
all our jackets in the tub.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.367
Bonnie?

01:57.451 --> 02:01.413
I told you, Joe, when we're alone,
you can call me "Bonald."

02:01.496 --> 02:03.081
No, i-it's me, Brian.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.333
Is that your real name?

02:04.416 --> 02:07.002
I mean, are you... Are you okay?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.671
- Sorry, am I allowed on the bed?
- I guess so.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.340
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.217
I have something in my eye.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.136
Yes, you do. It looks like sadness.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.889
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm your neighbor's dog.

02:18.972 --> 02:19.973
I don't know.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.683
It's just that when I was young,

02:21.767 --> 02:24.561
I had so many things
I wanted to do with my life,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.396
but now, I'm 46,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.775
and all I've ever done
is take care of Joe.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.861
And now you feel like you never
had a chance to be your true self.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.029
Yeah.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.531
I know just how you feel.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.450
I mean, I'm happy that Peter found me
and gave me a home,

02:38.534 --> 02:41.411
but sometimes I wonder
if I'd be happier on my own.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.496
Exactly.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.540
It's like sometimes, I feel...

02:44.623 --> 02:45.791
Trapped?

02:45.874 --> 02:49.419
No, I was going to say,
"like the von Trapps."

02:49.503 --> 02:52.381
You know, unable to leave
their home in Austria.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.217
Oh. Well, that still is remarkably close.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.720
Thanks for being so nice to me, Brian.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.681
Why are you scratching behind my ear?

03:00.764 --> 03:04.268
I... I don't... I don't know.
I thought it might make you feel better.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.062
It does feel kind of nice.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.481
You're a good girl.
You're going to be okay.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.575
I'm... I'm sorry. I did...
I didn't... I didn't mean...

03:19.658 --> 03:21.952
No, it's okay. Um...

03:22.035 --> 03:24.872
I better go downstairs
before Joe realizes I'm gone.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.417
And before Peter gets into the stuff
that's not for the party.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.210
Aw, Halloween candy!

03:30.294 --> 03:32.379
Peter, get out of the pantry.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.215
Ah, I can't believe
I just kissed my friend's wife.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.551
I'm a bigger scumbag than Spock.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.346
I heard that there was a Romulan ship
spotted in our sector, which means...

03:41.430 --> 03:43.056
Hey, hey.

03:49.021 --> 03:52.232
Kids, this morning, Principal Shepherd
wanted to say a few words.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.483
Thank you, Mrs. Abbott.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.568
Uh, before I start,

03:54.651 --> 03:58.071
are these the normal kids
or kind of the "dur, dur" ones?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.448
It's a healthy mix.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.699
Good morning, children.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.409
It's that time of the year again

04:02.492 --> 04:04.620
to fulfill your
community service requirement

04:04.703 --> 04:06.121
by signing up for volunteer work.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.664
Do we get to choose our own jobs?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.334
No, no, no, no.
The jobs will be assigned randomly,

04:10.417 --> 04:13.295
but the cooler and prettier students
have the better jobs.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.506
For instance,
blonde chick in the third row

04:15.589 --> 04:17.174
will wash my car this afternoon

04:17.257 --> 04:19.676
while Little Miss Frumpkin
with all the questions

04:19.760 --> 04:21.386
will work in an old folks' home.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.804
Is "frumpkin" good?

04:22.888 --> 04:24.806
No, no.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.063
Brian, what are you doing up so late?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.773
Ah, I'm having trouble sleeping.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.650
I got to tell you something.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.818
I kissed Bonnie last night.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.196
- What?
- I know! I know! It was a huge mistake.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.449
So let's just do two or three high-fives
and then forget it ever happened.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.368
Brian, if Joe finds out, he'll kill you.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.495
Yeah, no kidding.
That's why you can't tell anybody.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.330
- Promise me.
- Oh, don't worry. Don't worry.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.873
I'm great at keeping secrets.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.793
Well, except for that one time
you discovered my hidden shame.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.172
- Peter?
- Brian.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.466
I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.176
I'm one of these guys now.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.221
I'm sorry, Brian, I'm sorry.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.312
Mrs. Parkhurst?
I'm Meg, your new student volunteer.

05:12.396 --> 05:16.483
Oh, you must be my new student volunteer.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.193
Yeah, I just said that.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.945
What's your name, dear?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.321
It's Meg.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.823
Can... Can I get a new person?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.575
Nonsense, come in,

05:24.658 --> 05:28.745
and between you and me,
I hate my new student volunteer.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.497
That ugly little Meg.

05:30.581 --> 05:34.585
She says she's a girl,
but she certainly has a boy's body odor.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.469
Oh, come on in.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.889
Peter, Joe and Bonnie
are here for game night.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.015
Game night?

05:48.098 --> 05:49.975
Yeah, I figured it was
the least we could do,

05:50.058 --> 05:52.186
since you pulled up
a beheading video on your phone

05:52.269 --> 05:54.229
at their party and showed it to everyone.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.398
It was really more about
how loud my phone can get.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.692
- Peter, we're doing this.
-All right.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.527
But the <i>Operation</i> game
is out of batteries,

06:00.611 --> 06:01.945
so I'll have to make the noise.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.533
You hear that?
That's the sound of bad surgery.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.663
All right, I'm awesome at charades.
Guys are going first.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.998
Okay, go.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.917
Uh, <i>About a Boy.</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:17.002
Uh, <i>Four... Four Weddings and a Funeral.</i>

06:17.085 --> 06:18.420
Uh, <i>Nine Months.</i>

06:18.504 --> 06:19.546
<i>Notting Hill.</i>

06:19.630 --> 06:21.131
Yes, it was <i>Notting Hill.</i>

06:21.215 --> 06:23.300
I'm going to go get more wine.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.220
Oh, hey.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.596
Hi, Brian.

06:27.679 --> 06:31.934
Um, listen, about the other night.
You haven't told anyone, have you?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.519
No, no, of course not.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.187
I was going to ask if you had.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.524
<i>Hey, Brian, can you bring me up a snack?</i>
<i>I'm supposed to be in bed.</i>

06:38.607 --> 06:41.652
Look, the other night was great,
but it was a mistake.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.861
You're right.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.572
<i>Oh, man, wha...</i>

06:45.656 --> 06:47.074
Yeah, I me... I mean, there's...

06:47.157 --> 06:49.243
There's definitely some kind
of connection between us, but...

06:49.326 --> 06:50.536
I felt it, too,

06:50.619 --> 06:53.288
but maybe in another life, huh?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.457
Yeah, I guess you're right.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.792
This could never work.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.961
Like porn movies before sound.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.969
Ooh.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.389
Oh, there you are.
Come on, Bonnie, it's Joe's turn.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.016
Okay, here we go, uh, uh, crippled guy...

07:13.100 --> 07:14.560
Uh, cheating wife...

07:14.643 --> 07:17.521
Uh, uh, cheating wife of a crippled guy...

07:17.604 --> 07:20.524
Uh, dog... Some...
Something with a dog... Uh, dog kiss.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.652
I-I-I, uh, I think that's, uh, time.
Your, your turn is over.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.990
Oh, sounds like, uh, sounds like dog
kisses crippled guy's wife at your party.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.199
Wait, wait! I know it.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.951
The other night at your party,
Brian kissed Bonnie.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.202
- What?

07:32.286 --> 07:34.329
Bonnie, is this true?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.039
Oh, my God.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.875
I know, making out with a dog?

07:37.958 --> 07:41.420
Can you even imagine a woman
who possibly does that for real?

07:53.098 --> 07:54.516
Uh, hi, Joe.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.642
Hi, Brian.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.353
Look, I-I want to apologize
for what happened.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.522
I-I-I didn't mean to kiss Bonnie.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.691
Everybody had a little too much to drink.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.067
It-it just happened.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.694
Uh, I hope we're still cool.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.572
Hey, don't worry about it.
It was a crazy party.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.073
We ran out of salsa.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.327
How do you run out of salsa?

08:13.410 --> 08:14.912
Anyway, we're good.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.539
Really? Oh, thank God.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.666
I-I-I was worried you'd be mad.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.085
Mad? At my buddy, Brian?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.337
Not a chance.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.588
Hey, is that your car?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.426
What? No! Wh-what's he doing?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.053
My car was parked legally.

08:31.136 --> 08:36.266
Huh. Well, maybe your car
violated some sort of unspoken boundary.

08:36.350 --> 08:40.771
One that nobody bothers to codify
because it's just common decency.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.481
Hey, Joe, is that the guy?

08:42.564 --> 08:45.359
Read your text, Jerry.
Not supposed to say you know me.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.821
Well, I hope your day gets better, Brian,
but, uh, I wouldn't count on it.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.665
Boy, it wasn't easy, Mrs. Parkhurst,

08:59.748 --> 09:02.960
but I think we got the nail
that was poking through your slipper.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.755
Well, you strike me as someone
who's never going to get married,

09:06.839 --> 09:07.965
that's for sure.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.716
Now get me my itch cream.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.926
Is it in the drawer?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.012
Shut up! I'm trying to hum atonally.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.057
Ugh.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.570
Here's your cream. See you Thursday.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.323
Oh, my God, I can't believe I stole this.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.618
You know what? I don't feel bad.
That woman's a nightmare.

09:36.702 --> 09:39.496
Ooh, I should text this
to my best friend.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.958
Sick brooch!

09:43.041 --> 09:46.003
Adam, are you done
with that mayor homework, yet?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.380
It's called a bill, Mom.

09:52.843 --> 09:53.844
Hey, Brian,

09:53.927 --> 09:56.555
I, uh, feel that things
have been awkward between us,

09:56.638 --> 09:58.891
but just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

09:58.974 --> 10:01.435
- can I buy you a drink?
- You know what? Sure, thanks.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.859
What the hell happened?

10:11.486 --> 10:14.948
Ah! How do I walk? Are these forever?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.827
I also rubbed my butt on you
while you were unconscious.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.080
I like to put stuff online.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.254
Meg, Mom said that...

10:29.338 --> 10:31.006
Hey, what's all this stuff?

10:31.089 --> 10:32.799
Stuff I stole from the old folks' home.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.426
But you should see how they treat me.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.596
Meg, that's no excuse.
Stealing is just plain...

10:37.679 --> 10:40.224
Oh, my God,
is that someone else's glasses?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.518
I love wearing other people's glasses.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.230
Do I look like I stole atomic secrets?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.314
You do.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.192
Wow, this is awesome. I want in.

10:50.275 --> 10:54.738
And there's the splitting headache
from wearing someone else's glasses.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.330
Okay, Chris,
here's a room I haven't hit, yet.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.165
Here, follow my lead.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.212
Who's there? Why are you in my room?

11:10.295 --> 11:11.421
Oh, hi.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.424
You died,
and I'm here to take you to heaven.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.301
Um, upsy-daisy, here we go.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.639
Well, now that I'm in heaven...

11:22.182 --> 11:24.518
Hurry, take everything, and be quick

11:24.601 --> 11:28.063
or we'll be in bigger trouble
than a fat guy at a water park.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.566
Come on, Dad, let's go on the water slide.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.317
I can't fit.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.278
I'm afraid I'll get stuck.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.029
I'll just go in the lazy river.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.741
- But, Dad...
- No, son, this is the life I've chosen.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.413
<i>When your day is long</i>

11:46.790 --> 11:48.834
<i>And the night</i>

11:48.917 --> 11:52.796
<i>The night is yours alone</i>

11:56.175 --> 11:58.051
<i>When you're sure you...</i>

12:06.351 --> 12:09.479
<i>You've had enough</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:11.815
<i>Of this life...</i>

12:16.278 --> 12:17.988
Guys, thanks again for doing this.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.365
- Joe has been making my life hell.
- Of course.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.909
All right, now when Joe gets here

12:21.992 --> 12:24.494
we're just going to tell him
he needs to lighten up on Brian,

12:24.578 --> 12:27.331
and then we'll all talk this thing out
so we can move past it.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.124
And then I get to show my card trick?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.459
If there's time.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.252
Let's make this quick.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.214
What's going on? What's all this?

12:35.297 --> 12:38.509
Joe, we all know what happened
and we're here for you.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.220
But we think that you're taking
this revenge on Brian

12:41.303 --> 12:42.429
just a little too far.

12:42.513 --> 12:43.805
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, come on.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.932
It's... It's like enough is enough.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.894
The Triscuits are the rosemary kind,
not the regular kind.

12:48.977 --> 12:53.357
Me? I'm not the guy who violated
the sanctity of someone else's marriage.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.902
Well, you make a good point, Joe,
and you're right, this is Brian.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.613
We all know he don't care
where he gets his wick wet.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.240
Just ask Quagmire's father.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.408
Okay, we might be getting
a little off track, here.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.786
Yeah, yeah, Brian's right.
Joe, you're out of control.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.455
Even though Brian's been trying
to do my wife for years,

13:08.539 --> 13:10.123
and on some level, I hate him for it.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.125
Oh, Brian's a complete dick,
we all know that,

13:12.209 --> 13:13.752
but I think we're
losing sight of the point

13:13.836 --> 13:15.712
that Bonnie's a weird slut
who's always letting you know

13:15.796 --> 13:16.922
she's open for business.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.841
What? When am I doing that?

13:18.924 --> 13:20.676
Oh, come on, when are you not doing that?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.929
With that boo-boo-baby voice,
and that still-breastfeeding rack.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.055
Give me some of that!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.473
I'm Bonnie's friend,

13:26.557 --> 13:29.685
but she could sometimes get the mail
in something other than a robe.

13:29.768 --> 13:33.230
Okay, so we're all in agreement,
Bonnie and Brian are terrible people.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.191
Quagmire, I want you to think of a card,
but do not tell me what it is.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.276
Okay, enough.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.486
How dare any of you criticize Bonnie?

13:39.570 --> 13:42.948
For years, she gave up her own dreams
to take care of Joe.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.533
And yeah, maybe she kissed me.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.244
Maybe she needed to because she feels
so trapped in her marriage.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.328
It's true.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.415
No one ever takes the time
to ask how I feel.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.208
Brian's the only one.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.253
They don't get us, Bonnie,
and you deserve better than this.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.337
We both do.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.673
You know what? Let's get out of here.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.308
Wow, we are zero for two
on interventions today.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.853
I'm not changing for nobody.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.731
You're no...
You're the ones with the problems.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.489
Ah, we did it.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.742
We don't need those narrow-minded losers.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.327
This is so exciting.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.330
We can finally live
the lives we've always wanted.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.291
Like, I can finally start
my jewelry design business

14:34.374 --> 14:36.543
making earrings for tweens.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.463
Listen, hear that?

14:39.546 --> 14:43.050
That is the sound of not making
an enormous mistake.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.760
I think I hear it.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.305
Oh, hang on, looks like we need gas.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.933
So do you have, like, a credit card?

14:51.016 --> 14:54.811
Nope, and no cash, either,
but I don't care.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.980
I couldn't stand another moment with Joe.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.651
It was torture just watching him
do a crossword puzzle.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.320
Hey, Bonnie,
what's a five-letter word for marriage?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
Fraud.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.198
Uh, it's got to start with a "U".

15:06.281 --> 15:08.784
Union! Boy, you stink at this.

15:14.456 --> 15:19.837
Boy, it's just so comforting to be here
surrounded by other people's memories.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.132
Back into the sleeve with you.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.259
Can you hand me another nylon

15:25.342 --> 15:27.803
that I use as a sock
with my huge beige shoe?

15:27.886 --> 15:30.097
Sure, and can you hand me that ashtray?

15:30.180 --> 15:31.807
I might fire up this pipe again.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.809
Chris, that's not an ashtray.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.686
That's an urn for someone's ashes.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.812
Really?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.481
Yeah, you've been putting your pipe out
in some guy.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.609
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

15:42.693 --> 15:44.152
I feel awful.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.196
We need to give everything back.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.156
Oh, you're right.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.075
We need to do the right thing.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.202
Like the dad from <i>Small Wonder.</i>

15:52.286 --> 15:55.122
All right, Vicki,
time to shut you down for the night.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.083
Good night.
See you tomorrow.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.591
Nah.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.892
She's really gone,
and she took little Susie with her.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.852
I miss that baby more than anything.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.481
Oh, I guess she left it here.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.985
Joe, I want you to know,
I will not support that relationship.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.404
If Brian and Bonnie get married,
I will not go.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.907
Although, Brian might want
me to be his best man.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.451
Then I'd have to go,
and I'd have to dance.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.953
It would be weird to be best man
and not dance.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.496
And I'd have to give a toast,

16:36.580 --> 16:38.832
and say that Bonnie's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.084
You know, she is the best thing
that ever happened to him,

16:41.168 --> 16:44.129
but don't worry, Joe.
I'll only refer to you as Bonnie's ex.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.216
You know, like, "Bonnie has an ex,
but Brian marks the spot."

16:47.299 --> 16:49.426
- Oh, Peter, that's good.
- Thanks, babe.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.637
I hope Brian and Bonnie
are as happy as us.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.263
To Brian and Bonnie.

16:58.477 --> 17:02.564
Bad news, the teenage runaways
at table four were not big tippers.

17:02.648 --> 17:05.150
We just need enough money to get to Taos.

17:05.234 --> 17:08.570
That's like the capital
of making and selling your own jewelry.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.281
Okay, enough about the jewelry.
Do you even know how to make it?

17:11.365 --> 17:12.741
I know how to make jewelry.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.787
I just don't know
how to make the metal go into shapes.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.080
Hey, you know what'd be great?

17:18.163 --> 17:21.041
If you could talk with even
a little bit of inflection to your voice,

17:21.124 --> 17:23.502
so it doesn't sound so much
like a power sander.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.670
Screw you.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.713
You tweet things
that aren't worth tweeting.

17:26.797 --> 17:27.798
Well, I'm sorry,

17:27.881 --> 17:30.634
but Kim Kardashian did get famous
for making a sex tape.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.136
We all know that. That's not yours.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.848
And stop breathing through your mouth.
It's really annoying.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.183
I'm panting.
That's how I sweat, you dumb bitch.

17:38.267 --> 17:41.061
No, it isn't.
Dogs sweat through their paws.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.815
You're such a know-it-all, Brian,
you don't even know about your own body.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.483
At least I've had an orgasm.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.028
Wow, I am sorry.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.822
Look, th-this isn't us.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.616
This is just the no food
and sleeping in a car talking.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.703
We can make this work,
like couples who meet on Craigslist.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.958
You're not
what you look like in your picture.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.334
Let's get this over with.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.045
I wonder which one of us is the murderer?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.761
Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room,

18:14.845 --> 18:18.140
and then I'm done with my volunteer hours
and we never come back here again.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.685
Mrs. Parkhurst?

18:21.768 --> 18:25.647
Look at you two,
stealing from the elderly.

18:25.731 --> 18:29.443
You're worse than that Juliette Lewis
who makes out with dogs.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.653
Wait, is that a real thing?
Where did you hear that?

18:31.737 --> 18:32.905
What are your sources?

18:32.988 --> 18:35.157
Listen, we're very sorry
we stole from you,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.743
but you have it all back now,
so we cool, right?

18:37.826 --> 18:41.163
You know I should call the police on you.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.247
The police?

18:42.331 --> 18:45.792
Or maybe, instead, we do things my way.

18:45.876 --> 18:46.877
What's that?

18:46.960 --> 18:51.590
You will spend time with us
every afternoon after school,

18:51.673 --> 18:55.511
doing jigsaw puzzles,
reading us the newspaper,

18:55.594 --> 18:59.973
listening to poorly remembered stories
that have no point.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.767
You monster.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.018
Sit down.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.146
Now I feel some dementia coming.

19:06.230 --> 19:10.025
Feed me pudding
while I grip your wrist in terror.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.152
Ah, this isn't my house.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.076
See, if I make under 20 grand
for 20 years,

19:19.159 --> 19:20.577
my film school debt just goes away.

19:20.661 --> 19:21.828
That's a government rule.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.455
- Bonnie?

19:23.539 --> 19:24.581
Joe?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.291
How did you find me?

19:26.375 --> 19:28.752
Love is a powerful compass.

19:28.836 --> 19:31.755
Any time I quiet my mind
and clear my heart,

19:31.839 --> 19:33.549
it always leads me to you.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.551
Plus, dirtbag here has a chip in his ear.

19:35.634 --> 19:36.927
I do? Damn it.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.971
No wonder Peter's so good
at hide-and-seek.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.181
You're under the canoe in Quagmire's yard.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.432
Son of a bitch!

19:42.516 --> 19:44.893
Bonnie, I understand now why you left.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.856
Over the years, I probably
have become too dependent on you,

19:48.939 --> 19:51.275
and I'm sorry
if you've had to put your dreams

19:51.358 --> 19:53.026
on hold because of me.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.695
Oh, Joe.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.446
But I'm here to fight for you, Bonnie.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.574
And if you're willing to come back home,

19:58.657 --> 20:01.743
I promise I'll spend the rest of my days
taking care of you,

20:01.827 --> 20:04.538
just the way
you've always taken care of me.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.790
Of course, I want to come home, Joe.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.250
I love you.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.924
Wow, I guess just call me
Cupid, huh?

20:16.008 --> 20:17.259
You're welcome.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.011
Ow! Damn it!

20:21.180 --> 20:24.183
Hey, Bri, came to try that apple pie
you were texting about.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.267
Oh, you're shot.

20:29.188 --> 20:31.356
Well, Chris and I
sure learned a lot this week.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.318
Ha, you think you learned a lot.
I had quite an adventure.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.820
You know what guys?
We only got like 15 seconds left.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.405
We're gonna have to do these
at the same time.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.407
Let's race. And... Go.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.909
So Chris and I learned
that just 'cause people are old,

20:41.992 --> 20:43.493
that doesn't mean
you should steal from them.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.078
Bonnie didn't let you
stir the paint, did she?

20:45.162 --> 20:47.080
No. But I am done messing
around with neighbors' wives.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.582
Here's an invitation
to Donna's birthday party.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.292
-'Cause maybe then I'd like it.
- Hey, let me see that.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.919
- You rascal.
- Same old Meg.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.754
And the winner is... Nobody.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.048
Especially not you.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.174
Good night!
