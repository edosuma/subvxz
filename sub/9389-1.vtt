00:01.543 --> 00:04.713
(SINGING) It seems today
that all you see

00:04.796 --> 00:07.883
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:07.966 --> 00:11.094
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.178 --> 00:14.181
On which we used to rely?

00:14.264 --> 00:17.976
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.060 --> 00:21.355
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.438 --> 00:22.856
All the things that make us

00:22.940 --> 00:24.650
Laugh and cry

00:24.733 --> 00:29.530
He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:34.243 --> 00:36.119
Come on, kids, people are
gonna start showing up

00:36.203 --> 00:38.205
for the costume party
any minute.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.040
Hey, nice Snoopy costume, Brian.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.250
Thanks.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.335
Oh, I guess it's not true what they say,

00:43.418 --> 00:45.504
you can punch Snoopy in the
stomach as hard as you can

00:45.587 --> 00:47.422
and he won't feel it. That's Houdini.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.258
No, Brian. Now get up and do the dance.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.676
Oh, no, I'm not gonna do the dance.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.469
Do the dance!
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

00:58.642 --> 01:00.143
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:01.353 --> 01:02.980
Hey, Quagmire.
Ah, cool,

01:03.063 --> 01:04.648
you dressed like
Napoleon Dynamite.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.024
Hey, do you say
anything funny?

01:06.108 --> 01:08.735
No, I just do quirky things
for the sake of being quirky.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.404
You strike me as someone
I wouldn't enjoy,

01:10.487 --> 01:11.613
but others might.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
Who are you dressed as, Peter?

01:12.781 --> 01:13.907
I'm Laura Bush.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.617
And I'm the guy she killed.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.785
That's right. I forgot.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.328
Laura Bush killed a guy.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.746
Yes, she did.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.290
Laura Bush killed a guy.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.542
Laura Bush killed a guy.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.044
Well, come on in.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.755
Oh, you know, this is why...

01:28.839 --> 01:31.091
Brian, you remember,
the last couple of weeks

01:31.175 --> 01:33.177
I kept saying, "Can I have a
couple minutes of your time

01:33.260 --> 01:34.678
"to talk to you about something?"

01:34.761 --> 01:36.180
This is what it was about.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.598
This evening is ru-ined.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.682
Look... wait, what?

01:38.765 --> 01:39.933
This evening is ru-ined.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.185
The whole evening
is ru-ined.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.145
-Why are you saying it like that?
-Saying what?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.897
I'm just pointing out
the party's ru-ined.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.024
You know, I'm not gonna
get sucked into this.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.903
Okay, just so I'm sure, really?

01:50.986 --> 01:52.696
Are you just trying to piss me off

01:52.779 --> 01:53.864
or is that really how you say that?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.115
What are you talking about?

01:55.199 --> 01:56.617
I'm talking about
this ru-ined evening.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.410
-That's not how you say "ruined."
-What? Ru-ined?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.078
What do you call the remains
of ancient Greek structures?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.205
Ruins.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.498
-And how would you describe this evening?
-Ru-ined, of course.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.583
This evening is ru-ined.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.709
-Say "ruined."
-Ru-ined.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.127
-Ruined.
-Ru-ined.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.462
-Ruined.
-Ru-ined.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.839
-Dumbass.
-Oh, Brian, don't be crue-el.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.466
That's a great costume, Joe.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.051
Are you FDR?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.386
No, I'm Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.305
Oh, you mean like if he dove
into the shallow end?

02:18.388 --> 02:20.265
No.
Regular Mark Spitz.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.017
Wait, are you Stephen
Hawking at the beach?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.727
No, I'm Mark Spitz!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.395
He won seven gold medals!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.731
Oh, I get it.
You're crippled Magnum P.I.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.815
I'm...!

02:28.899 --> 02:31.068
Fine, I'm crippled Magnum P.I.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.738
(GASPS) Brian, there's that girl
from my yoga class

02:34.821 --> 02:36.031
I wanted you to meet.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.491
Oh, look, Lois, I appreciate it,

02:37.574 --> 02:39.243
but I'm not into fix-ups.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.579
Oh, come on, you gotta get
yourself back out there.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.998
Jane, this is Brian.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.083
Oh, Brian!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.377
Lois has told me so much about you.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.504
Wow, you're even more
handsome than she said.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.797
Hey, thanks.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.174
So, uh, that's a great costume.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.552
What are you, one of
Freddy Krueger's victims?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.262
I'm a victim of the liberal agenda.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.805
I'm a murdered fetus.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.014
Did you know that Democrats

03:01.098 --> 03:02.850
murder thousands of babies every year?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.935
And sometimes babies are
put back into the womb

03:05.018 --> 03:07.104
just so that they can be aborted again.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.939
Have you ever had any sex
that was voluntary?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.816
-No, I have not.
-Yup, have a good evening.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.109
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.654
-(CHIRPS)
-Yeah, with a capital "C."

03:18.991 --> 03:21.076
Oh, stop looking so depressed, Brian.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.870
I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl

03:22.953 --> 03:24.705
who loves abortion as much as you do.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.039
That's not the point, Stewie.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.959
I'm just tired of every
girl I meet being crazy.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.377
Aw, things will work out for you.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.004
Now come on, let's forget our problems

03:32.087 --> 03:34.298
and get lost in the world of books.

03:34.381 --> 03:39.887
Ooh, Horton Hears Domestic Violence in
the Next ApartmentAnd Doesn't Call 911.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.263
MAN: (YELLING) You think it's
easy working all day?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.307
-WOMAN: No! I... You think I like it?
-I don't think it's easy,

03:43.390 --> 03:44.766
but, yes, I do think you like it.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.226
Yeah, I like being away from you

03:46.310 --> 03:47.769
'cause I can't stand looking at you!

03:47.853 --> 03:48.854
-You... Aah!
-(LOUD THUD)

03:48.937 --> 03:50.063
(CRYING) Yeah!

03:50.147 --> 03:51.231
You think I want to do that?

03:51.315 --> 03:52.649
You think I want to hurt you?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.026
Not in front of the baby!

03:54.109 --> 03:55.861
(SCREAMS) I don't want to hurt you!

03:55.944 --> 03:58.447
I'm sure there's two sides to this.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.159
-Whoops.
-I'm sorry.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.660
I don't think you want this book.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.745
It's all about atheism.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.371
Oh, I know. I'm an atheist.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.664
Really? So am I.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.999
It's all yours.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.834
I feel bad taking the last copy.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.628
Well, there's one way to settle this.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.130
If there is a god,
send another copy.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.257
I guess that's our answer.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.550
(CHUCKLING)

04:18.634 --> 04:20.302
Tell you what. How about I take it

04:20.385 --> 04:21.637
and then send it to you after I read it?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.721
Swear to God?

04:22.804 --> 04:24.848
(LAUGHS) Stop it.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.391
I know, I'm just messin'...

04:26.475 --> 04:28.477
well, uh, listen, uh,
here-here's my address.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.853
Thanks.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.938
See ya later.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.404
God, still no mail for me, huh?

04:39.488 --> 04:40.614
Jeez, Brian, you've been
going through the mail

04:40.697 --> 04:42.491
every day for a week.
What are you looking for?

04:42.574 --> 04:44.368
I'm expecting a very important package.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.245
Another one? You haven't even opened

04:46.328 --> 04:49.039
the one that came for you a week ago.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.458
You idiot, why didn't you
tell me this was here?

04:51.542 --> 04:53.794
Because I've been using it
as a hat weight.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.921
-A what?
-A hat weight, Brian.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.381
My hat kept blowing away,

04:57.464 --> 04:59.299
so I put the package on it
so I wouldn't lose it.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.717
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.845
You don't wear a hat and
there's no wind in here.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.811
You, sir, owe me
one new hat.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.066
You know, uh, I was really glad
you sent me the book.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.776
I won't lie to you, I came this close

05:17.860 --> 05:19.236
to praying that I'd see you again.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.029
Good thing you didn't because...

05:21.113 --> 05:22.155
BOTH: Who would hear it, right?

05:22.239 --> 05:23.282
(LAUGHING)

05:23.365 --> 05:24.658
Can I interest you folks

05:24.741 --> 05:26.451
in some of our heavenly cheesecake?

05:26.535 --> 05:29.580
No, but I'll have some of our
"there's no afterlife" soufflÃ©.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.207
-(CHUCKLING)
-(CHUCKLING)

05:32.291 --> 05:33.584
Now we got the waiter involved, eh?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.836
(LAUGHING) I love being a part of things.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.921
I'll bring your dessert now.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.256
You know, Carolyn,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.550
I rarely find myself
connecting with another person

05:41.633 --> 05:42.926
like I have with you.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.344
I'm really enjoying your company.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.638
Oh, me, too, Brian.

05:48.974 --> 05:53.395
(MAN SINGING)
The boat rides we would take

05:53.478 --> 05:57.107
The moonlight on the lake

05:57.191 --> 06:04.114
The way we danced
and hummed our favorite song

06:04.615 --> 06:11.580
The things we didlast summer

06:11.872 --> 06:15.083
I'll remember

06:15.167 --> 06:19.922
All winter long

06:20.005 --> 06:23.842
The midway and the fun

06:23.926 --> 06:27.513
The Kewpie dolls we won

06:27.596 --> 06:34.561
The bell I rang to provethat I was strong

06:35.312 --> 06:42.277
The things we didlast summer

06:43.195 --> 06:49.117
I'll rememberall winter long...

06:50.369 --> 06:53.205
I had a really great time tonight, Brian.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.083
Well, is there any reason it has to end?

06:58.377 --> 07:00.629
STEWIE: (WHISPERING) Don't do it, Brian.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.007
What the hell?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.884
Excuse me for a second.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.345
Stewie, have you been hiding
in the back all evening?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.472
Yes, I'm saving you
from yourself, Brian.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.723
You almost went in there

07:11.807 --> 07:13.392
and tried to have sex with that girl.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.685
So, what's wrong with that?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
That's why you can't
maintain a relationship.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.356
You always try too soon
and end up blowing it.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.607
Think about it.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.109
God, you know, maybe you're right.

07:22.192 --> 07:25.195
I do. I always try and jump
into the sex right away.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.239
Maybe that's what screws things up.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.576
You know, I'm gonna
take it slow this time.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.996
Listen, um, I-I gotta go.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.080
Really?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.874
Don't worry. You'll see me again.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.419
Good job, Brian.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.962
Don't worry. I'll help you through this.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.213
(ENGINE STARTS)

07:43.297 --> 07:44.631
So, you wanna get something to eat?

07:44.715 --> 07:46.008
Can we go someplace

07:46.091 --> 07:47.426
where the menus have pictures of the food?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.845
Ooh, let's go someplace
where the menus have pictures of food!

07:53.056 --> 07:55.225
Gosh, I really enjoyed the movie tonight.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.436
Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be a touching comedy

07:57.519 --> 07:59.438
because Robin Williams had a beard.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.025
Ooh, my back is so stiff from
sitting in that theater chair.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.985
I could probably use a back rub.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.195
Do you mind?

08:06.278 --> 08:07.988
Oh, not at all.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.573
You know, I, uh, took a Thai massage class

08:09.656 --> 08:10.908
at the Learning Annex.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.910
STEWIE: Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

08:12.993 --> 08:14.661
Boy, that's an awfully loud owl.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.746
Hoo-hoo!

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
Don't do it, Brian!

08:16.914 --> 08:20.000
Hoo-hoo!
Take it slow! Hoo-hoo!

08:20.083 --> 08:22.586
Uh, of course, I'll tell you
what'd really set you right

08:22.669 --> 08:24.713
is a couple of Aleve
and a good night's sleep.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.797
Oh.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.217
Well, all right, if you say so.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.844
Well, I guess I should say good night.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.722
Ho-hoo-hoo! Good job, Brian!

08:33.805 --> 08:35.057
Hoo-hoo!

08:35.140 --> 08:36.225
-Hi there.
-Not interested.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.392
Okay.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.314
Ooh, tandem bike.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.566
You gonna take a ride out in the country

08:44.650 --> 08:46.193
and let the AIDS blow through your hair?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.277
Get lost, Stewie.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.820
I am getting laid tonight.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.781
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
happened to taking it slow?

and I haven't tried anything,

08:54.993 --> 08:56.036
even though she's been giving me

08:56.119 --> 08:57.538
some pretty strong signals.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.997
So, do you have any thoughts

08:59.081 --> 09:00.624
on what you might want to do tonight?

You don't want to mess things up.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.675
Well, we'll find out tonight, won't we?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.510
All right, but just one
last piece of advice.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.096
Remember, listen to her body,

09:14.179 --> 09:17.099
and respond the way you'd
want her to respond to you.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.934
Uh, okay. Thanks.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.435
That's very helpful.

I don't believe this.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.267
Cleveland, you're sleeping
with my girlfriend?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.269
Nobody told me
Carolyn was your girlfriend.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.520
I'm not his girlfriend.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.980

10:06.398 --> 10:08.150
Well, you never made a move on me,

10:08.233 --> 10:09.943
so I thought you just
wanted to be friends.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.363
Then I met Cleveland, and
things just kinda took off.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.866
Wha...? H-how did you even
meet each other?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.868
We met at the Starbucks.

showed a little restraint,

you'd respect me.

back together and whatnot.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.499
I wouldn't forgive her so fast, Cleveland.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.042
Remember, she slept with Quagmire.

to "forgive and forget"?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.678

out of the picture

16:09.761 --> 16:11.555

Th-That's not it at all.

the very least,

16:34.745 --> 16:37.623
Brian, do you really think
Loretta is beautiful?

16:37.706 --> 16:40.000
Absolutely. That's really how I feel.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.669
Now, it is true
her personality is abrasive.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.588
Slightly abrasive.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.090
But overall, Loretta
is a delightful person,

16:47.174 --> 16:48.884
very pleasant to be around,

16:48.967 --> 16:51.220
and free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.309
I'm really concerned
about Cleveland.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.311
What Loretta did was unforgivable.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.438
I hope he doesn't go back to her.

17:01.522 --> 17:02.648

17:02.731 --> 17:04.608

17:04.691 --> 17:06.944
to drive the point home
that she hasn't changed.

-How would we do that?
-Hang on.

-Quagmire!
-What?

-You busy right now?
-No, I got a hand free. What's up?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.372
Would you mind getting Loretta
to sleep with you again?

17:18.455 --> 17:19.831
Uh, I... Possibly.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.542
I mean, in what context?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.919
Well, we're trying to make
Cleveland see that she's no good

17:24.002 --> 17:25.462
and that he can't trust her,

17:25.546 --> 17:27.506
and if he catches you guys
in the act, then...

17:27.589 --> 17:29.424
Oh, okay, oh, no, no, okay,
no, I'm-I'm with you now.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.134
Yeah, no, yeah, you know,
I can probably work that in.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.302

17:32.386 --> 17:33.679
This is perfect, Lois.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.889
We'll expose Loretta
for who she is.

Just like Cyrano was exposed
for being anti-Semitic.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.075
for starting every major war
since the dawn of t...

17:55.158 --> 17:57.035
Dude, again with this?
What's your problem?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.453
Who's in the bush?

17:58.537 --> 18:00.539
CYRANO: Mind your own business,
you stupid Jew!

18:05.377 --> 18:06.587
Room service.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.380
I didn't order no room service.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.923
It's complimentary.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.218
We have a club sandwich,
a fruit plate and a side of...

18:13.302 --> 18:15.262
Hot beefsteak!
Giggedy-giggedy-goo!

18:15.345 --> 18:17.681
(GASPS) Glenn Quagmire!
You get out of here!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.725
Come on, baby.
Time for round two!

18:20.017 --> 18:21.518
(LORETTA YELLING)

18:21.602 --> 18:22.644
You're the devil!

18:22.728 --> 18:24.229
You ruined my marriage!

18:24.313 --> 18:25.981
Oh, you can't resist the Q-man

18:26.064 --> 18:27.691
and my super-powered genitalia.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.943
Apache Penis, Ee-nay-chok!

18:32.237 --> 18:34.364
Aah! You go on and beat it, little neck!

18:34.448 --> 18:35.657
I'm a changed woman!

18:35.741 --> 18:37.367
I don't mess with your kind anymore!

18:37.451 --> 18:38.619
You're a meanie!

18:38.702 --> 18:39.786
(SOBBING)

18:40.913 --> 18:42.539
Hey, Quagmire.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.374
Uh... hey, Cleveland.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.293
Why are you staying in a hotel?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.462
Uh... my...

18:48.545 --> 18:50.339
house burned down.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.716
Oh. Why are you naked?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.260
Naked? Wha... But
everybody's been telling me

18:55.344 --> 18:59.014
I'm wearing magnificent robes
made from the finest silk. Oh!

19:03.018 --> 19:04.353
(GASPS) Cleveland!

19:04.436 --> 19:05.646
Hello, Loretta.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.855
Oh, come in, baby.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.899
Have you thought
about what I said?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.860
Yes, I have, and I still
love you, Loretta.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.612
Oh, Cleveland!

19:13.695 --> 19:16.990
But... I-I can't take you back.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.200
Wh-Why not?

19:18.283 --> 19:21.078
Loretta, I came over here
wanting to believe

19:21.161 --> 19:23.497
that there was still
a chance for us.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.792
But on the way, I passed a lake,

19:26.917 --> 19:30.629
skipped a few rocks and had
some black-guy thinking time...

19:31.338 --> 19:34.174
L-Loretta, we leave
certain parts of our lives

19:34.258 --> 19:35.759
in the past for a reason.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.344
What you and I...

19:37.427 --> 19:39.847
You can go ahead and put
your clothes back on...

19:39.930 --> 19:42.349
What you and I had was a wonderful thing,

19:42.850 --> 19:46.186
and as much as I still have
a great deal of love for you,

19:46.270 --> 19:48.188
our time is over.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.607
I love somebody else.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.443
Oh, Cleveland, isn't
there anything I can do

19:53.527 --> 19:54.611
to make you happy?

19:54.695 --> 19:56.071
Yes, there is.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.073
You can live
your life, Loretta.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.451
Live it as full
and as wonderful as you can.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.203
I love you.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.182
(GASPS) Oh, my God! Carolyn?

20:23.640 --> 20:24.975
Quagmire?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.185
Cleveland, close the window!

20:26.268 --> 20:27.811
You're letting the stank out!

20:31.565 --> 20:33.692
Well, we both got screwed
by the same girl.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.068
Yup.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.987
I guess it's all right, though.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.781
You and I will find true love someday.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.992
(SIGHS) Yeah, I suppose.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.161
So, how was it having sex with Carolyn?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.330
I think I'm gonna remember it forever.

20:46.663 --> 20:47.789
Oh, yeah? How so?

20:47.873 --> 20:50.918
Brian, do you think you could
identify a genital wart?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.171
I... I-I-I...
I would think

20:54.254 --> 20:56.298
that would be something you'd
check with your doctor about.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.841
-Okay.
-Okay?

20:57.925 --> 20:59.968
-Yeah.
-All right, 'cause I'm not a doctor.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.637
-I can't...
-No, I understand.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.388
-Okay, so we're... we're still friends?
-Yeah, yeah.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.265
Okay.

21:05.349 --> 21:08.268
Well, summer's coming on.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.103
It hurts.
