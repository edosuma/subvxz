00:20.771 --> 00:24.274
Please.
You don't have to do this.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.110
Oh, God!

00:27.236 --> 00:30.697
Not like this.
No, you can't. Please!

00:33.867 --> 00:36.036
No.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.206
Please.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.794
<i>Por favor!</i>

00:43.919 --> 00:45.963
I am so sorry.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.841
Oh, God, I wanna go home!

03:09.481 --> 03:11.483
You having fun?

03:11.608 --> 03:15.612
- Am I the only one having a problem with this?
- I guess they're used to it.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.782
<i>I just keep thinking about</i>
<i>how far we must be from a hospital.</i>

03:18.907 --> 03:21.994
<i>You know, with doctors who operate</i>
<i>instead of amputate?</i>

03:22.119 --> 03:24.329
So dramatic.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.961
- Would you slow the fuck down!
- Jesus Christ, relax! You're such a tourist.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.547
<i>Por favor!</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:37.426
<i>Calm down. He drives through it every day.</i>
<i>I think he knows how to drive better than you do.</i>

03:37.509 --> 03:40.679
- He drives like a fucking lunatic.
- Well, we're fine, aren't we?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.974
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.059
- We're flying back.
- <i>Okay, fine.</i>

03:46.143 --> 03:49.062
- And I'm picking the hotels from now on.
- You were right about that.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.106
I'm sorry.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.035
Check it out.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.120
- That looks painful.
- Stop it!

04:05.204 --> 04:07.623
What do you think it says?

04:07.706 --> 04:10.250
It says,
"Welcome to Brazil. Now bend over."

04:10.334 --> 04:12.920
- We have to remember that.
- He likes you.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.635
<i>Deus!</i>

05:01.718 --> 05:04.513
<i>Jesus Christ! Stay on the road, you lunatic!</i>

05:12.062 --> 05:14.815
Go out the window!
Go! Go!

05:14.898 --> 05:18.402
- Get out!
- <i>Get out! Go, go, go!</i>

05:18.527 --> 05:20.821
Get out right now!

05:20.904 --> 05:24.116
Everybody out!

05:27.578 --> 05:30.455
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Go!

05:30.581 --> 05:32.875
Go! Get off!

05:32.958 --> 05:34.710
<i>Jump! Get off!</i>

05:38.755 --> 05:42.092
Oh, my God.
Get off! Get off, get off!

05:43.760 --> 05:46.180
<i>Get off!</i>

06:00.402 --> 06:03.572
- <i>Oh, shit!</i>
- Did everyone get out of there?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.663
- You still think flying
would've been a waste of money?

06:11.788 --> 06:13.332
- Don't start.
- I told you this was-

06:13.457 --> 06:15.083
- Don't!
- Fine.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.711
Why is my luggage
always the last to come out?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.426
Ale-Alex? Found it!

06:24.551 --> 06:26.470
Great!

06:26.637 --> 06:28.472
I'm impressed.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.183
- Why?
- Bit like bringing sand to the beach though.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.686
Bringing a couple of fit little birds
like that to Brazil?

06:34.811 --> 06:37.940
- That's my sister.
- Splendid.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.317
Just like to know me options.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.569
It's not an option.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.821
- Get everything?
- Yeah, I think so.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.157
- Hi, I'm Finn. Nice to meet you.
- Bea. You too.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.826
- Liam.
- Hi. How are you guys?

06:49.952 --> 06:52.120
Good as gold.
Hi. I'm Finn.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.623
- Amy. Nice to meet you.
- Liam.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.085
Guess we're bonded for life now, eh?
Near-death experience.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.629
- Great story to tell the grandkids.
- Yeah.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.799
- You think they got a plan to get us out of here?
- I doubt it.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.843
- Should find out, I suppose.
- I'll find out.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.428
Oh, man.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.606
"Bussie!"
You suck at driving buses!

07:19.690 --> 07:21.817
You should do something else.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.652
Pick bananas or something.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.821
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.824
- I'm Alex.
- Pru.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.826
Yes. Yes.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.704
- You're, um, supposed to kiss back.
- Ah. Sorry.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.583
Except you don't actually kiss.
You sort of kiss the air.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.418
- Yeah. Start again.
- I'm Alex.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.087
- Pru. Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.173
- So, do you speak Spanish?
- It's Portuguese here.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.634
- Right. So, any idea what
these guys are talking about?
- Another bus is on its way.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.596
- It's gonna be about 10 hours.
- Ten hours?

07:50.721 --> 07:53.307
- Yeah. And then it's another 18 to Recife.
- Wait, what did you just say?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.309
- <i>About what?</i>
- About where we're headed.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.395
Well, the way that guy was driving,
I'm not really sure.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.189
- But you said Recife, right?
- Yeah.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.649
- Which is north of Salvador.
- On most maps.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.028
- <i>Which means we've been</i>
<i>headed north this whole time.</i>
- Idiots, the pair of us.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.447
We got on the wrong fucking bus!

08:08.572 --> 08:10.157
- The Rastafarian.
- I knew he was dodgy.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.368
- <i>Brilliant cunts we are.</i>
- Wait. Where did you guys think you were going?

08:13.452 --> 08:16.038
- To Floripa.
- Oh, you took the long way.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.207
- <i>Yeah. Where was this bus headed?</i>
- Belém.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.211
<i>Don't suppose that Belém is famous</i>
<i>for having a 10-to-1 ratio of women to men...</i>

08:22.294 --> 08:24.254
where even the ugly girls
look like Giselle.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.382
<i>And they're all smart, fun,</i>
<i>alcoholic nymphomaniacs...</i>

08:27.508 --> 08:29.843
with a soft spot for charming
if slightly grubby foreign tourists?

08:29.927 --> 08:32.429
Uh, not that I'm aware of, no.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.431
- Too bad.
- 'Cause Floripa is.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.893
Six- Six <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
swimsuit models are from Floripa.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.313
- <i>Do you understand how select</i>
<i>that gene pool must be?</i>
- It's a tiny town.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.743
- Leave it out.
- All right.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.663
- Hey, are you getting anything?
- No. Nothing.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.252
Do you think they know
something we don't?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.295
I'm gonna walk around.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.470
<i>Bonita.</i>

09:13.595 --> 09:16.765
<i>Meu nome é Bea.</i>

09:16.849 --> 09:19.309
Hey!

09:19.434 --> 09:23.522
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

09:23.647 --> 09:25.190
Photograph.
Photograph. It's a-

09:28.610 --> 09:30.445
Hey, hey.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.532
- Jesus! Calm down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:33.657 --> 09:36.285
Calm down! I'm sorry!

09:36.368 --> 09:39.621
- You're not to take pictures
of kids without permission.
- How am I supposed to know?

09:39.705 --> 09:42.875
Hey. "No, senhorita"
would have been fine.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.877
Or even "No, you stupid,
bloody gringo!"

09:45.002 --> 09:47.296
Asshole! I can't hear ya!

09:47.421 --> 09:50.966
Leave the girl alone. All right?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.845
Prick.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.847
Tabloids have been writing stories
about foreigners...

09:56.930 --> 09:59.516
coming here to steal kids
to sell their organs for transplants.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.643
It's created a lot of hostility
to tourists.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.230
- Has that anything to do with
that couple that were missing?
- I don't think they're a couple.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.150
- French couple, right?
- Oh, I thought you meant the kayakers.

10:08.275 --> 10:12.404
Oi! We got no designs on your organs!
All right? Your kidneys are safe with us!

10:12.529 --> 10:14.406
We're on holiday, for fuck's sake!

10:14.531 --> 10:17.534
Hey, where'd you get those from?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.835
- What did she say?
- She said there's a bar on the
beach and it's really close.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.879
- <i>We can walk.</i>
- Is there a town?

10:28.962 --> 10:32.508
- Don't you think we should wait for the next bus?
- They haven't <i>made</i> the next bus.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.681
Let's go.
We'll come back later.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.725
Let's do it.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.022
So, how did you end up here?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.566
I'm here with my little sister.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.568
She's always wanted
to come to Brazil...

10:51.652 --> 10:55.197
my mom didn't want her to go alone
and didn't trust her with Amy...

10:55.322 --> 10:58.742
so I get to pretend to be the boyfriend
when creepy guys try to bother her.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.745
What happens when
creepy girls bother you?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.957
- So what about you? You traveling alone?
- Yeah.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.210
- That's brave.
- Not really. I've been everywhere
they tell you not to go.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.756
Colombia, Nigeria. Just spent
three months in a favela in Rocinha.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.301
The only place I've ever had any problems
is in a small town in Australia.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.971
- So, you're from Australia?
- Uh-huh.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.973
Got a boyfriend in Australia?

11:21.098 --> 11:23.976
No! You did not just say that!

11:24.101 --> 11:26.895
- What?
- "So, you got a boyfriend in Australia?"

11:26.979 --> 11:31.233
I just meant that if I had a girlfriend
or a little sister who was traveling alone...

11:31.316 --> 11:33.235
I'd be a little worried, that's all.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.280
Well, don't be.
I can take care of myself.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.950
- So, did she say this was
a proper bar with real drinks?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.286
I don't know.
She didn't say.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.913
Christ, I'd do anything for a pint.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.916
I'd lick the sweat
off a monkey's balls.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.336
"I'd lick the sweat off a monkey's balls."

11:51.461 --> 11:54.131
- Christ on a cracker.
- <i>This is amazing!</i>

11:54.256 --> 11:57.676
<i>Oh, yes! Check this out!</i>

12:03.140 --> 12:05.350
- Baby!
- Oh, yes!

12:05.475 --> 12:07.811
Whoo! Who wants to go for a swim?

12:07.936 --> 12:10.814
- Yeah, sure!
- Yes! This is what I was talking about.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.609
- <i>They got beer?</i>
- Get your kit off, girls!

12:13.734 --> 12:15.652
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Let's swim!</i>

12:17.362 --> 12:19.823
Shit.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.368
I left my top in Rio.
Would you guys mind if I went topless?

12:23.493 --> 12:27.039
- <i>Are you serious? No. Keep your shirt on.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Why not?</i>

12:27.164 --> 12:30.125
Do you see what they're wearing, Alex?
We're not in America.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.961
<i>No one's gonna care if I go topless.</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:37.216
Yeah, but the idea is to tastefully reveal
as much as possible-

12:37.341 --> 12:39.885
Oi, oi.
Get a load of that.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.471
without actually
revealing so much...

12:42.554 --> 12:45.807
that you can still get into heaven.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.144
That was good.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.147
Yes!

12:52.231 --> 12:55.359
- That is a fantastic trick.
- Well, it's still a Catholic country.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.819
- Well, we're Catholics.
- And we definitely don't mind.

12:57.903 --> 13:03.116
<i>No. In fact, I think I can speak for Liam when</i>
<i>I say we wouldn't be offended in the slightest.</i>

13:03.200 --> 13:05.994
<i>In fact, let's all go topless,</i>
<i>boys and girls.</i>

13:06.078 --> 13:08.413
No, Amy-

13:08.539 --> 13:11.416
<i>Oh! Nice!</i>

13:11.542 --> 13:13.418
Put your shirt on.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.254
She's a naughty girl.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.382
- How about that? Is this better?
- <i>Oh, no!</i>

13:18.507 --> 13:20.050
Come on.
Let's go.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.219
All right, let's go get it wet.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.227
- <i>Come on, Alex!</i>
- <i>Whoo!</i>

13:54.543 --> 13:56.420
Let's get a drink.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.922
- <i>Alex, where are you going?</i>
- Over here.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.800
<i>Whoo!</i>

14:09.683 --> 14:11.602
- <i>Qual é seu nome?</i>
- <i>É camila.</i>

14:11.727 --> 14:13.729
Pru. Alex.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.356
Nice to meet you.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.193
- What do you want?
- Uh, Coke, please.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.196
A Coke? You're 7,000 miles away
from home. Try something new.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.198
- Like what?
- Have you ever had assai?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.908
Uh, no.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.952
It's, like, this amazing drink
from the Amazon. It's-

14:29.077 --> 14:32.039
Just a Coke's fine.
Thank you. No ice.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.458
My God, I love this country.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.544
<i>It's like we died on the bus and this is heaven.</i>

14:37.628 --> 14:39.796
<i>It's heaven.</i>
<i>It's, uh,</i> paraíso <i>.</i>

14:39.922 --> 14:42.257
And you? Angel.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.053
Wait.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.055
You too!
Come on!

14:48.138 --> 14:50.432
Ah!

14:51.558 --> 14:53.435
- Don't want to-
- <i>Por favor?</i>

14:56.313 --> 14:58.732
- No ice.
- No, no. It's, like, a hundred fucking degrees.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.443
No, it's like ordering with dysentery
or without dysentery. No ice.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.736
Dysentery.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.281
This is unbelievable.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.451
You think you've found
your own private Shangri-la.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.996
Next thing you know, the place is crawling
with backpacking tourists wearing sandals.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.374
Welcome to paradise.
I'm Svend.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.292
- Pru, my sister Bea, Amy.
- Hi.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.837
- <i>Where are you from?</i>
- London.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.339
- <i>London. We're from Sweden.</i>
- Sweden! Nice!

15:22.422 --> 15:27.886
We rode this beauty all the way from Mexico City
and stopped to have a drink three days ago.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.389
<i>Now we can't</i>
<i>find any reason to leave.</i>

15:30.514 --> 15:33.058
Yeah, and Brazilians
are the warmest and friendliest...

15:33.183 --> 15:35.769
and most chill people
you're ever gonna meet.

15:35.853 --> 15:40.482
<i>The drinks are cheap, and Camila's cooking,</i>
<i>it's unbelievable.</i>

15:40.566 --> 15:44.403
And you even have a barrack you can sleep in
on the beach- only four bucks a night.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.405
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Go on!

15:46.530 --> 15:48.407
About what?

15:48.532 --> 15:51.326
Oh, no, no.
It's just an expression, like "no way."

15:51.451 --> 15:55.372
- <i>Oh. Yeah!</i>
- I hate living up to the natives' stereotype, but-

15:55.497 --> 15:58.041
and I think I speak for
my brother when I say this-

15:58.166 --> 16:00.043
we're not leaving here...

16:00.169 --> 16:03.547
- until either we run out of money-
- Or they run out of beer!

16:05.549 --> 16:08.051
- Oh, my God.
- So, what do you think?

16:08.135 --> 16:11.263
About getting on the bus?
Come on. Look where we are.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.265
Well, how do we get back?

16:13.390 --> 16:16.518
Hitchhike to a bigger town. We'll get on
a better bus, with air conditioning and brakes.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.731
You in?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.733
- Sure.
- Yeah! Let's do it!

16:22.816 --> 16:24.484
All right, fuck the bus.

Why won't someone pass me the ball?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.082

17:20.165 --> 17:22.251
<i>Oh!</i>

17:22.334 --> 17:25.295
<i>We know how to play this game!</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:27.297

17:27.381 --> 17:29.299
- You suck, Amy.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.134
<i>Go on. Dance with her.</i>

20:59.259 --> 21:02.596
No, no, I'm not dancing.

21:02.679 --> 21:06.767
No, no, no, it's not you. It's just that I have
these very European hips.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.020
- They have to stay parallel to the floor at all times.
- Huh?

21:10.145 --> 21:12.606
Apart from when I'm naked.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.359
I can't do that.

21:15.484 --> 21:17.653
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are you?

21:17.736 --> 21:20.322
Go on!

Arolea.
Mmm!

22:23.552 --> 22:25.429
Mmm!

22:54.082 --> 22:55.959
This song is so <i>nasty</i>.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.961
What are they saying?

22:58.086 --> 22:59.963
I'm not getting it all,
but basically...

23:00.088 --> 23:02.966
it's a long list of explicit things
he likes to do in his car-

23:03.091 --> 23:05.427
one being up the ass.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.429
Mmm!

23:22.653 --> 23:24.613
Do you wanna dance?

23:24.696 --> 23:26.657

23:37.876 --> 23:40.295
Oh, yes!

Yes. More.
All of it. All of it.

23:56.311 --> 24:00.357
Oh! Yeah!
Take it all off. Yeah!

24:00.482 --> 24:03.193
- <i>Mais?</i>

24:03.318 --> 24:05.195
Please.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.656
<i>Mais! Mais!</i>

24:08.740 --> 24:11.535
Oh, my God.

24:13.120 --> 24:17.124
Oh, God bless Brazil.
Come on.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.882
Yeah!

24:28.385 --> 24:31.305
I love Brazil!

24:36.059 --> 24:40.314
<i>God, you really are an angel.</i>
<i>Wanna come back with me to London?</i>

24:42.733 --> 24:45.027
Oh, w-wait. No!
It's not like that!

24:45.110 --> 24:48.113
- <i>É assim.</i>
- But I thought you liked me. No?

24:48.238 --> 24:50.199
No.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.221
Hey, Svend!
What a night!

25:12.346 --> 25:14.723
Hey! Dude!

25:14.848 --> 25:17.059
Bloody lightweight.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.329
<i>Bea!</i>

26:19.413 --> 26:21.331
<i>Bea, get up!</i>

26:21.415 --> 26:23.584
Come on, get up. Get up.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.669
Bea.
Come on, come on.

26:27.004 --> 26:29.423
- You okay?
- What?

26:29.506 --> 26:32.467
- You okay?
- No. I feel sick.

26:32.551 --> 26:34.928
What happened?

26:35.012 --> 26:36.889
They robbed us.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.474
- What?
- <i>We got robbed.</i>

26:39.600 --> 26:41.810
- By who?
- I don't know.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.812
- What did they take?
- Everything.

26:43.896 --> 26:45.856
- What do you mean, everything?
- I mean everything.

26:45.939 --> 26:48.901
Our money, our credit cards,
our phones, our backpacks...

26:49.026 --> 26:50.903
our passports, everything.

26:51.028 --> 26:53.280
- Nana's ring.
- Yes, everything.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.993
My earrings are gone.
How did they take my fucking earrings?

26:58.076 --> 27:01.663
I think that they drugged us. They must have
put something in our drinks last night.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.333
Mom is gonna kill me. She told me not to
bring the ring, 'cause-

27:04.458 --> 27:06.502
Bea.

27:06.627 --> 27:10.672
That is a very small problem right now.
We have no money. We have no way out of here.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.592
We'll be fine.

27:13.717 --> 27:15.511
- You think so?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

27:15.636 --> 27:18.430
<i>'Cause I'm not so sure.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

28:32.838 --> 28:35.757
Mm-mmm.

28:35.841 --> 28:39.428
Hold on.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.700
Hey!

29:01.825 --> 29:03.744
No! No! No! No!

30:13.438 --> 30:15.107
No.

30:27.578 --> 30:30.581
No.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.547
What?
What did she say?

30:38.672 --> 30:41.633
Oh, God. She's saying it's down here to the left.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.636
The other guy said it's down here
to the right. So I have no idea.

30:44.761 --> 30:47.139
Are you sure it's smart
going to the police?

30:47.264 --> 30:50.142
- Aren't they supposed to be
worse than the criminals?
- Not all of them.

30:50.267 --> 30:53.562
- Come on.
- Someone in this town
must know what's going on.

30:57.608 --> 31:00.527
These kids are definitely in on it.
It's freaking me out.

31:09.036 --> 31:11.371
- God.
- What did he say?

31:11.455 --> 31:14.917
Let's, uh- Let's just try up here-
this little house or something.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.760
- Are you sure we're going the right way?
- That's what he said.

31:24.843 --> 31:26.803
I don't know.

31:37.231 --> 31:39.191
Alex?
Where are you going?

31:39.316 --> 31:41.693
Aah! Ow.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.446
- <i>What is it?</i>
- The Swede's motorcycle.

31:46.281 --> 31:48.242
Hello?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.120
Olá!

31:52.204 --> 31:54.540
<i>Olá!</i>

31:55.958 --> 31:58.168
Hey! Hey!
Whose motorcycle is this?

31:58.293 --> 32:00.754
Ask him who got-
Where'd they get this motorcycle?

32:03.382 --> 32:06.927
That's Alex's hat.
That kid has Alex's hat.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.596
- Alex!
- Alex, he's got your hat.

32:12.057 --> 32:13.892
Grab him! Quick!

32:15.561 --> 32:19.022
- <i>Wait up, Liam!</i>
- <i>Just wanna talk to you!</i>

32:19.106 --> 32:20.899
<i>Where'd you get that hat?</i>

32:21.024 --> 32:24.319
Come back here!

32:24.444 --> 32:26.780
<i>Wait! Shit!</i>

32:28.198 --> 32:30.200
<i>Oww! Aah!</i>

32:33.495 --> 32:35.789
- <i>Where'd he go?</i>
- Don't know.

32:37.207 --> 32:39.334
Aah!

32:42.296 --> 32:45.257
Come back here!
Now!

32:48.552 --> 32:52.014
You wait till I fucking catch you.

32:58.270 --> 33:00.439
Now I've got you, you little shit.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.360
Oh, shit.

33:09.781 --> 33:12.743
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

33:19.499 --> 33:21.710
What happened?
What'd you do?

33:21.793 --> 33:24.713
- It was an accident.
- <i>You threw a rock at him?</i>

33:24.796 --> 33:26.757
Didn't mean to hit his head.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.343
- It was an accident.
- We got robbed!

33:29.468 --> 33:31.970
He had our friend's cap!

33:32.095 --> 33:33.972
It was an accident!

33:34.097 --> 33:36.517
Hey! Don't touch me!

33:49.530 --> 33:51.406
- Walk away.
- Let's just go. Let's just go.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.576
Hey, come on. Just relax.
Just walk away.

33:54.701 --> 33:57.579
Come on, come on, come on!

34:03.126 --> 34:06.004
- <i>Are they following us?</i>
- <i>No, I don't think so.</i>

34:06.129 --> 34:08.090
W-We were robbed.
<i>R-Roubado. Roubado.</i>

34:08.215 --> 34:10.092
- I know.
- You know?

34:10.217 --> 34:12.094
- Everybody knows.
- Who did it?

34:12.219 --> 34:15.097
<i>Who did it?</i>

34:17.056 --> 34:19.351
What police?

34:19.476 --> 34:21.853
You crazy.
No police here. Okay?

34:21.978 --> 34:24.857
<i>What do you mean, there's no police here?</i>

34:24.982 --> 34:27.943
- <i>Christ, dude, where are you going?</i>
- Stay here.

34:32.155 --> 34:34.032
Nice work.

34:34.157 --> 34:36.534
- <i>Leave him alone.</i>
- It was a fucking accident.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.911
- You don't throw a rock at a kid!
- Let it go!

34:38.996 --> 34:41.956
- <i>Let it go!</i>
- <i>I'm sorry. Okay?</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:44.751
- Sorry, everybody.
- <i>It's all right.</i>

34:56.972 --> 34:58.932
Let's go, guys.

34:59.975 --> 35:01.685
- Damn!
- Come on!

35:01.810 --> 35:03.228
Come on!
Come on!

35:03.353 --> 35:06.982
- <i>Okay, man! Hold up!</i>
- <i>Where are we going?</i>

35:07.065 --> 35:10.068
- Is not good for you in town.
- Yeah, no kidding.

35:10.194 --> 35:13.155
They are looking for the father
of this boy that you hurt.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.157
<i>Is bad man.</i>

35:15.282 --> 35:17.951
<i>They find him, is very bad for you.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

35:18.035 --> 35:19.953
Ask him where we're going, Pru.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.668
There is-There is
a house of his uncle...

35:26.793 --> 35:29.171
<i>and he says that it's very safe</i>
<i>for us there.</i>

35:29.296 --> 35:32.674
No. We just want a ride.
Do you know anybody with a car?

35:35.302 --> 35:37.679
No, no, no. No car.

35:37.763 --> 35:40.807
There is-

35:40.891 --> 35:43.685
<i>The only car is of the guy</i>
<i>that robbed us.</i>

35:43.769 --> 35:46.855
- <i>You'd better wait for the bus.</i>
- <i>There's a bus? When is there a bus?</i>

35:46.980 --> 35:49.149
Uh, <i>qu-quando-</i> At what time?

35:49.233 --> 35:51.151
Uh... today?

35:51.235 --> 35:53.362
- <i>Today there's a bus?</i>
- Yes.

35:53.487 --> 35:57.157
- What time?
- Two day.

35:57.241 --> 35:59.159
- Two days.
- Two days?

35:59.243 --> 36:01.745
Why does everything take
so fucking long in this place?

36:01.828 --> 36:04.790
- Two day-
- Okay, <i>vamos</i>. <i>Vamos la. Vamos.</i>

36:10.087 --> 36:12.965
<i>Fuck! These insects are eating me alive.</i>

36:13.090 --> 36:15.968
- Look at that. All over me legs.
- Leave it out.

36:16.093 --> 36:19.388
There'd better be a big bag
of fucking weed at this house.

36:22.349 --> 36:26.353
Kiko, can we just...
stop for a minute?

36:26.478 --> 36:28.897
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

36:28.981 --> 36:31.483
- Where are you going?
- The men's room.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.644
Whose idea was it to leave the bus?

37:07.769 --> 37:10.647
- Whose idea was it to come to Brazil?
- It was yours!

37:10.772 --> 37:13.650
- I wanted to go to Bali.
- You're missing the point.

37:13.775 --> 37:16.904
The point is, if we dig deep enough
I'm sure we'll discover this is all your fault.

37:16.987 --> 37:18.906
Oh, right. Yeah.

37:18.989 --> 37:21.909
- <i>Which'll make me feel a lot better.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

37:21.992 --> 37:25.287
And you know what? I <i>did</i> want to
come to Brazil. Why? Because I like girls.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.122
And I like beaches and drinking.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.249
And when they say
"Come to Brazil," they say...

37:29.333 --> 37:33.128
"Come to Brazil! We've got girls
and beaches and drinking!"

37:33.253 --> 37:36.131
What they do not say,
what they completely neglect to mention...

37:36.256 --> 37:39.635
is anything about being chased
into the jungle by an angry fuckin' mob...

37:39.718 --> 37:42.638
<i>which is not my idea</i>
<i>of a fun vacation at all!</i>

37:42.721 --> 37:45.140
<i>Oi, Kiko!</i>
<i>How far is this house?</i>

37:45.265 --> 37:48.977
- Uh, uh, <i>como</i> far?
- Hey, man, not so bad.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.647
What do you mean?
This is pretty fucking bad!

37:51.772 --> 37:54.441
<i>What about a road?</i>
<i>Is there a road we can walk on?</i>

37:54.525 --> 37:57.819
- No roads.
- What kind of house has no roads?

37:59.905 --> 38:02.950
Fucking hell.

40:06.156 --> 40:08.075
<i>Come on! Almost there!</i>

40:08.158 --> 40:10.577
<i>Kiko! Where are we going?</i>

40:10.661 --> 40:13.580
<i>There is a place where we can rest.</i>

40:13.664 --> 40:15.666
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

40:17.334 --> 40:19.253
Check it out!

40:19.336 --> 40:21.255
<i>Come on! I show you something.</i>

40:21.338 --> 40:24.341
- Wow.
- <i>This is my secret place.</i>

40:24.424 --> 40:26.301
Kiko, can we swim here?

40:26.426 --> 40:28.303
I show you some caves.

40:28.428 --> 40:30.305
What caves? Where?

40:30.430 --> 40:32.808
There are caves in the water.

40:32.933 --> 40:34.810
We'll swim, then go to house.

40:34.935 --> 40:38.146
- How close is the house?
- It's right on the river.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.524
Ten minutes.

40:40.649 --> 40:43.068
<i>Hey, guys, watch me!</i>

40:43.193 --> 40:46.029
You're joking. You're never gonna jump off of this!

40:46.154 --> 40:48.782
- Kiko, It's too dangerous.
- Go ahead!

40:48.866 --> 40:51.368
- Stop encouraging him!
- I am diving all the time!

40:51.493 --> 40:53.954
Less talking!
More action!

40:54.079 --> 40:56.081
No, stop!
Don't do it! No!

40:56.206 --> 40:59.001
Kiko! Whoa!

41:01.128 --> 41:03.714
<i>Crazy son of a bitch!</i>

41:03.839 --> 41:07.509
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Come on!

41:07.634 --> 41:10.179
<i>Come on, come on! Come down!</i>

41:10.304 --> 41:12.848
Swim!
I show you caves!

41:12.973 --> 41:15.726
- <i>No way I'm doing that!</i>
- Come on. Let's go see 'em.

41:15.851 --> 41:18.187
- I'm staying here.
- <i>You sure?</i>

41:18.270 --> 41:20.189
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

41:20.272 --> 41:22.900
- <i>You can do it!</i>
- Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, stay here too.

41:23.025 --> 41:25.319
Right.
Behave yourself.

41:31.575 --> 41:33.493
Here?

41:33.577 --> 41:35.787
- The caves! Come on!
- Over there?

41:35.913 --> 41:37.789
I can't.
No, no, I can't.

41:37.915 --> 41:39.583
Follow me.
It's an easy swim.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.585
You can do it.

41:41.710 --> 41:44.671
- <i>Come on. Let's do it.</i>
- Okay.

42:00.312 --> 42:03.065
- Hey, Bea, you okay?
- Yeah.

42:03.148 --> 42:07.069
- Is this it?
- Come on. A little more far.

42:12.282 --> 42:15.744
- Follow me.
- <i>Kiko, where are we?</i>

42:15.869 --> 42:17.746
Where are we goin'?

42:17.871 --> 42:19.790
Fuck! That was a bat!

42:21.166 --> 42:22.918
Kiko.

42:23.001 --> 42:24.920
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

42:25.003 --> 42:28.090
- <i>Kiko, what is this?</i>
- We go under.

42:28.215 --> 42:30.008
- No!
- No. No.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.010
- There-There is a hole.
- No, no, no, no.

42:32.135 --> 42:34.555
Hey, man, it's easy.

42:34.638 --> 42:37.182
This is incredible.
Incredible!

42:37.307 --> 42:39.810
- All right. Let's go. Fine. Fine.
- No. No.

42:39.935 --> 42:42.646
- One, two, three.
- What?

43:19.516 --> 43:22.603
Asshole!
What the fuck is this?

43:24.188 --> 43:26.315
Oh, Jesus!

43:26.398 --> 43:29.318
That was not easy.
It was scary.

43:29.401 --> 43:31.320
And this is not incredible.

43:31.403 --> 43:33.322
We go more.
We go more.

43:33.405 --> 43:35.324
Ow! Ow!
Jesus!

43:35.407 --> 43:37.743
- Kiko!
- Fucking lunatic!

43:38.911 --> 43:40.954
- Kiko!
- <i>Shit! The light!</i>

44:16.323 --> 44:18.617
Holy shit!

44:18.742 --> 44:21.703
<i>Wow, look at this place.</i>
<i>Bea, look at this.</i>

44:23.455 --> 44:26.041
Wow, this is amazing. What is this place?

44:26.124 --> 44:28.043
Very nice, Kiko!

44:28.126 --> 44:30.546
<i>This water is so beautiful!</i>

44:39.054 --> 44:41.056
- <i>This is incredible.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

44:43.183 --> 44:45.602
<i>Is my secret place.</i>

44:55.863 --> 44:59.867
I-I never making friends
with the gringos before.

44:59.950 --> 45:01.577
- No?
- <i>No.</i>

45:01.702 --> 45:03.996
I never have, um, speak with one.

45:04.121 --> 45:05.998
Really?

45:06.123 --> 45:07.958
Well, hi there!

45:08.083 --> 45:10.043
Oh, my God.

45:14.047 --> 45:15.924
You okay?

45:16.049 --> 45:17.593
What?

45:17.718 --> 45:19.469
You-You feel okay?

45:19.595 --> 45:22.264
- Yes, yes. I am okay.
- Okay.

45:23.557 --> 45:25.309
Uh, maybe...

45:25.434 --> 45:27.311
we go back to town.

45:27.436 --> 45:29.146
- What?
- <i>Aqui.</i> Yes.

45:29.271 --> 45:31.023
Is better we go back.

45:31.148 --> 45:34.526
We just hiked 10 hours through the jungle.
How can you go back?

45:34.651 --> 45:37.613
- Did you say go back?
- We're not going back. No way.

45:37.738 --> 45:41.074
Yes.
I-I-I think is better.

45:41.158 --> 45:44.620
- Why?
- Maybe I talk with these guys, okay?

45:44.745 --> 45:47.539
Um, tell them you are okay.

45:47.664 --> 45:49.791
Maybe find a ride for you.

45:49.917 --> 45:52.336
But why are you saying this now?

45:52.461 --> 45:56.173
- I don't know. It's just, um-
- It's just what?

45:56.298 --> 45:58.175
No- No nothing.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.887
<i>Look, it's simple- 10 hours hike through</i>
<i>the jungle, or 10 minutes to the house.</i>

46:02.012 --> 46:04.765
I don't like hiking.
We go to the fucking house.

46:04.848 --> 46:07.851
Is there a problem
with this house, Kiko?

46:07.935 --> 46:09.478
No. No problem.

46:09.603 --> 46:12.105
Then we go to the house.
Okay?

46:12.231 --> 46:14.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:14.525 --> 46:16.777
That's for almost killing us!

46:19.029 --> 46:21.406
Come on, guys.
We walk back.

46:29.248 --> 46:32.668
- Oh. Hey. What's going on?
- Oi, oi!

46:32.793 --> 46:35.963
Hi. How was it?

46:36.046 --> 46:38.966
- Awesome. Underwater caves. It was cool.
- There were bats.

46:39.049 --> 46:40.968
Come on.
Let's go together.

46:41.051 --> 46:43.303
Hey, Kiko, show me how you do that.

46:43.387 --> 46:46.223
- I wanna do it. Show me. Yeah.
- Let's jump together.

46:46.348 --> 46:48.767
One, two, three!

46:55.357 --> 46:57.776
You guys should try it!

46:57.901 --> 47:00.696
Dude, I wanna try.
Show me how you do it.

47:00.779 --> 47:02.739
Okay, okay.
I go.

47:03.866 --> 47:06.660
<i>Whoo! Crazy!</i>

47:09.079 --> 47:12.249
<i>Whoo! Oh!</i>

47:15.335 --> 47:17.212
- <i>Shit! He's bleeding!</i>
- <i>Kiko!</i>

47:17.337 --> 47:19.214
- We're coming down!
- Stay up!

47:19.339 --> 47:20.883
Jesus Christ!

47:22.509 --> 47:25.846
- <i>What happened?</i>
- He must have hit his head on a rock below.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.931
Keep his head above the water!

47:28.015 --> 47:30.809
Is he conscious?

47:30.934 --> 47:33.103
Oh, my God.

47:33.228 --> 47:35.731
- Get him to the side.
- Come on, come on!

47:35.856 --> 47:37.608
- <i>Swim! Swim!</i>
- <i>Over here!</i>

47:40.861 --> 47:42.529
What are we gonna do?

47:42.613 --> 47:44.531
Take him back to the village.

47:44.615 --> 47:46.992
We'll never get back before dark.
We'll go to the house.

47:47.117 --> 47:49.995
- We don't know where the house is!
- He said it was on the river.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.748
Help me get him out. Grab my shirt.
We're gonna wrap his head.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.628
<i>Is he gonna die?</i>

47:57.753 --> 47:59.630
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>How do you know?</i>

47:59.755 --> 48:03.634
<i>Between rugby and bar fights, I've probably</i>
<i>had a concussion a year since I was nine.</i>

48:03.759 --> 48:06.136
- <i>When did you play rugby?</i>
- <i>I played!</i>

48:06.261 --> 48:08.680
- We should have just gone back to the village.
- No way!

48:08.805 --> 48:10.766
They'll fucking kill us!

48:13.435 --> 48:15.812
What is this place doing here?

48:15.938 --> 48:17.814
You okay?

48:17.940 --> 48:20.400
He all right?

48:21.902 --> 48:23.779
Hello!

48:23.904 --> 48:26.114
Nearly there.

48:26.198 --> 48:28.116
Whoa. This is crazy.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.118
Almost there.

48:30.202 --> 48:32.162
Hello?

48:33.288 --> 48:35.165
This guy likes his privacy.

48:35.290 --> 48:38.502
- Hey, look, there's a dip there.
- Hello!

48:38.627 --> 48:40.504
Oi!

48:40.629 --> 48:43.507
Anyone home?

48:43.632 --> 48:45.717
Bea, get a chair.

48:48.136 --> 48:50.973
Here we go.

49:00.691 --> 49:03.318
<i>Fuck!</i>

49:05.404 --> 49:08.240
- Oh, shit, that's deep.
- Jesus.

49:08.365 --> 49:11.785
Keep pressure on that.
We need something to close this up.

49:11.869 --> 49:15.247
Find, uh, superglue,
needle and thread, anything.

49:15.372 --> 49:17.040
Check upstairs.

49:27.384 --> 49:29.344
<i>Olá?</i>

49:40.272 --> 49:42.232
<i>Olá!</i>

50:16.225 --> 50:18.185
<i>Olá?</i>

50:46.964 --> 50:50.175
- Hold his head right here.
I gotta cut some of this out.
- Okay.

50:50.300 --> 50:52.177
Oh. Sorry.

50:52.302 --> 50:55.013
- Hold his fucking head up!
- I got it. I got it!

50:56.765 --> 51:00.644
Vicodin, codeine, Demerol made out to
every imaginable name and nationality-

51:00.769 --> 51:03.605
- <i>Gustav Roth, Marco Terelli-</i>
- Hold him.

51:03.689 --> 51:06.733
What the hell is this place, some kind of
youth hostel for drug addicts?

51:06.859 --> 51:08.777
- Gotta hold this shut.
- I got it!

51:08.861 --> 51:10.779
- A stapler?
- No, no, no. You can't use that.

51:10.863 --> 51:12.823
- It's fine.
- No!

51:12.948 --> 51:15.367
It's what they used on me when I split
me head open. Hold it closed.

51:15.492 --> 51:17.119
- Hold it shut.
- You got it.

51:17.202 --> 51:18.745
- Oh, Jesus.
- More.

51:18.829 --> 51:20.205
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

51:20.330 --> 51:22.583
- Sorry, mate.
- Hold him.

51:25.294 --> 51:27.963
- Okay?
- I got him. I got him.

51:31.008 --> 51:34.678
<i>Kiko, where you going? Are you okay?</i>

51:34.803 --> 51:37.431
- Kiko.
- <i>Kiko, you okay?</i>

51:42.311 --> 51:45.063
<i>Kiko.</i>

51:45.189 --> 51:47.274
Should we keep him awake?

51:47.357 --> 51:49.276
I don't know.

51:49.359 --> 51:51.737
He could have a concussion.

51:57.993 --> 51:59.870
Clothes.

52:06.335 --> 52:08.212
Mmm.
Smoked herring.

52:10.339 --> 52:12.382
Let's see.
Mushrooms and cheese.

52:12.508 --> 52:14.885
That's good.

52:17.054 --> 52:19.932
Hey. Look. Look what I got.

52:20.057 --> 52:21.934
Oh, you want some, don't you?

52:22.059 --> 52:24.436
You want some.
Come here. Up here.

52:24.561 --> 52:26.522
Yeah.

52:27.731 --> 52:29.942
Nasty.
Here you go.

52:30.984 --> 52:32.736
Ohh.

52:34.696 --> 52:37.491
Yeah!

52:44.248 --> 52:46.208
Hey.

52:48.460 --> 52:51.713
- Anything good?
- I think our luck might be turning.

52:51.839 --> 52:55.300
- Oh, yeah?
- Twenty-year-old single malt.

53:00.514 --> 53:02.474
What the hell is this?

53:12.109 --> 53:14.570
Who the hell are these people?

53:22.828 --> 53:24.496
Hmm.

53:24.621 --> 53:26.915
Thank you.

54:48.247 --> 54:50.666
This house is so fucking creepy.

54:50.749 --> 54:52.668
We'll just stay the night.

54:52.751 --> 54:55.671
Then Kiko will show us the way out
in the morning.

54:55.754 --> 54:59.174
- If he dies, how do we get back?
- He's not gonna die.

54:59.258 --> 55:02.177
'Cause I don't wanna be here
if his uncle shows up and we're like...

55:02.261 --> 55:05.180
"Hello, mate. Here's your dead nephew.
And you're out of scotch."

55:09.268 --> 55:12.187
And why is there no road?
What kind of fucking hermit lives-

55:12.271 --> 55:15.399
- Oi!
- Yeah, I know. Leave it out.

55:17.651 --> 55:20.529
So, how does this rank
with your other trips?

55:20.654 --> 55:23.532
After the last few days,
right at the bottom. You?

55:23.657 --> 55:27.452
- Well, we had a pretty tough time in Cambodia.
- At least we had that hash.

55:27.578 --> 55:29.538
Yeah, and those Dutch girls.

55:31.248 --> 55:33.208
I just want to go home.

57:38.250 --> 57:40.210
His uncle.

57:49.511 --> 57:51.388
What's going on?

57:51.513 --> 57:53.140
I'm not sure.

58:10.699 --> 58:12.826
What is he saying?

58:25.797 --> 58:27.841
<i>Alex.</i>

58:31.762 --> 58:33.472
Kiko, what's-

58:33.597 --> 58:35.474
<i>Olá.</i>

58:43.023 --> 58:44.983
Hi.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.985
Hi.

58:47.069 --> 58:49.196
- You guys American?
- Mm-hmm.

58:49.321 --> 58:51.740
Cool. I've been one time
to New York.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.867
Hmm.

58:56.995 --> 58:59.081
Go. Run.

58:59.206 --> 59:01.208
- What do you mean?
- Run right now.

59:01.333 --> 59:04.628
This guy has plans for you
and your friends...

59:04.753 --> 59:07.631
and his plans are pretty fucking elaborate
and pretty fucking fucked.

59:07.756 --> 59:09.883
<i>So if I were you, I'd just run.</i>

59:21.812 --> 59:25.315
Look, we didn't-
We're friends of Kiko.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.734
He said- Hey! Shit!

59:30.988 --> 59:33.615
No.

59:49.381 --> 59:52.301
Kiko. Kiko!
Where the fuck did you take us?

59:52.384 --> 59:55.179
Tell him we're your friends.
Where the fuck are you going?

59:55.304 --> 59:57.681
- <i>Kiko!</i>
- <i>Tell him we're your friends!</i>

59:57.806 --> 59:59.892
<i>Where are you going?</i>

59:59.975 --> 01:00:02.186
- Alex, help me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:05.898
- Get your fucking hands off me!
What's the matter with you?

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:07.900
Back off!

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:10.402
Oh, God!

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:07.209
<i>Don't take this personal, okay?</i>

01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:12.756
If it makes you feel any better...

01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:15.717
please know that I'm doing this...

01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:18.512
<i>for a good cause.</i>

01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:21.765
Please, don't.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.851
Did you know that in America...

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:27.229
there is a seven-year wait...

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.606
for a healthy kidney?

01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:33.569
And in Europe...

01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:37.573
it's worse.

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:40.534
So...

01:01:40.617 --> 01:01:43.704
if a rich gringo needs a kidney...

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.747
what does he do?

01:01:45.873 --> 01:01:49.418
Wait and get sick and die
like the rest of us?

01:01:49.543 --> 01:01:51.712
- Don't. Please.
- No.

01:01:53.714 --> 01:01:55.716
He comes here to Brazil...

01:01:55.841 --> 01:01:58.135
to take advantage of our bounty...

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.472
and of our poverty.

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:05.976
<i>The whole history of our country...</i>

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:08.770
is you taking from us...

01:02:08.854 --> 01:02:11.023
and our land-

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.984
rubber, sugar, gold.

01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:20.616
And from our bodies-
for slaves, for sex.

01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:25.662
And now, for- for our insides.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.630
<i>But I...</i>

01:02:34.755 --> 01:02:37.132
have had...

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:39.843
enough.

01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:33.230
Bea! Bea!

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:37.192
Take the knife!
Take it!

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:39.653
Take the knife.
Cut this rope off.

01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:41.697
Cut this off my hands.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:54.793
Cut.

01:04:00.591 --> 01:04:03.218
<i>Hurry.</i>
<i>Bea, hurry!</i>

01:04:04.344 --> 01:04:07.055
<i>Attagirl. Attagirl.</i>

01:04:07.973 --> 01:04:09.725
Cut- Cut it.

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:14.313
Hurry!

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:26.575
It sickens my heart,
this combination-

01:04:26.658 --> 01:04:29.244
- your greed-
- Oh, God, no.

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:31.914
and our weakness.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.752
And so I am thinking:

01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:42.299
Maybe there is something
I can do to even the scales just a little-

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:46.512
to help you find a way...

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:48.597
to give back.

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:23.966
Today I am to take
the organs of all of you...

01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:26.885
and give them...

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.304
to the People's Hospital in Rio.

01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:34.142
Counting down from right now,
I have-

01:05:34.268 --> 01:05:36.645
I have about 12 hours...

01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:40.482
to get your liver
and your kidneys...

01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:42.568
and the liver and kidneys...

01:05:42.651 --> 01:05:44.653
of all your fucking <i>amiguinhos</i>...

01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:48.657
into that helicopter
and back to the city.

01:05:48.782 --> 01:05:53.704
I'd take your hearts too,
your corneas-

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:56.874
even the skin from your lily-white asses.

01:05:56.999 --> 01:05:59.084
But they don't travel too well.

01:06:03.005 --> 01:06:07.301
You can only keep a heart
outside a body for six hours.

01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:11.221
But I want that.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:14.516
I want a heart-

01:06:15.726 --> 01:06:19.062
a heart of some
arrogant fucking gringo tourist...

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:21.148
pumping life back into the veins...

01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:23.567
of a little <i>Brasileiro</i>.

01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:29.948
But that's gonna take more planning.

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:50.427
Your turn.

01:08:22.728 --> 01:08:25.647
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, come on!

01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:27.733
<i>Kiko, grab the key!</i>

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:32.279
Go, go!

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:35.782
- Come on, come on!
- Oh, oh!

01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:45.082
Hurry up!

01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:50.923
Come on, come on!

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:56.845
- Come on. Go to the waterfall.
We'll meet you there.
- No!

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.096
- Alex!
- Take her to the waterfall! Go!

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.265
- Alex, no!
- Come on. Let's get him out.

01:09:11.693 --> 01:09:13.694
Please. Please, don't.

01:09:15.488 --> 01:09:17.908
<i>Please. Please.</i>

01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:28.126
Please don't. Please.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.712
No. No.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.924
No, please don't.

01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:36.468
<i>No, please!</i>
<i>Please, don't!</i>

01:09:57.447 --> 01:09:59.867
Shut up, you-

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:03.120
Come on!

01:10:03.245 --> 01:10:05.497
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

01:10:07.499 --> 01:10:10.586
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go, man! Go!

01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:13.130
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not leaving Finn.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:15.382
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Don't be stupid!

01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:17.426
What the fuck is that?
Yo, go, man!

01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:20.053
- Get the fuck away from me, Kiko!
- Ow!

01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:26.912
Shh. Stay back.

01:11:56.233 --> 01:12:00.070
<i>Jesus, please!</i>
<i>Come on now. Go! Go, go!</i>

01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.499
Oh, fuck.

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:15.002
Come on. I'm gonna get you
out of here, bro.

01:12:15.085 --> 01:12:17.880
You'll be all right, okay?

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:20.132
Help me get him out.

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:53.373
Fuck! Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:55.709
Come on! Come on!

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:02.799
Quick, quick!

01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:15.145
Shh.

01:14:08.282 --> 01:14:10.784
<i>Shh. Keep quiet.</i>

01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:13.203
<i>Shh!</i>

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:31.471
Let's go. All right,
go, go, go, man, go!

01:14:35.976 --> 01:14:39.605
Go! Go! Run! Run!

01:14:45.736 --> 01:14:48.405
Hey!

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:52.743
Oh, my God. Come on! He's dead!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:55.287
Jesus! Come on!

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:59.249
<i>You're crazy! You're crazy!</i>
<i>You stupid son of a bitch! What are you doin'?</i>

01:14:59.374 --> 01:15:01.752
Fuck you!

01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:27.880
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Alex! Alex!

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:30.340
Hi.

01:16:33.343 --> 01:16:35.345
Hi.

01:16:37.764 --> 01:16:41.643
- Amy-Amy's-
- No, no, she's gone.

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.687
I'm sorry.

01:16:43.812 --> 01:16:46.064
Hey, man.

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:50.235
It's danger. Danger, okay?
Let's go.

01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:52.487
All right.
Come on, Bea. Up, up.

01:16:52.613 --> 01:16:56.491
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

01:17:15.844 --> 01:17:19.056
Hurry, Bea.
Come on, come on!

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:30.776
Hey, guys, come on!

01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:55.175
You okay?

01:17:55.259 --> 01:17:57.594
I've been here most of the night.

01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.680
What about the others?

01:18:01.181 --> 01:18:04.476
They're gone.
Come on. We gotta go.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.271
<i>Be quiet! Silence!</i>

01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:13.587
- Stop it!
- You crazy, man!

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:16.840
This is all your fault! You brought us here!
You knew this was gonna happen!

01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:19.176
- He's risking his life!
- Fuck that!

01:19:23.639 --> 01:19:26.308
Go, go, go! Get down! Dive!

01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:32.314
Come with me.

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:27.160
- You okay?
- What are we gonna do?

01:20:27.244 --> 01:20:30.289
We gotta find a way out of here.

01:20:39.548 --> 01:20:41.758
- There's someone coming.
- What? Who?

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:44.720
<i>I'll find another way out.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:23.342
Turn off your light.

01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:31.183
- He's coming! Let's go!
- No, I can't! I can't go!

01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:33.602
Bea, you have to!
Come on!

01:22:37.374 --> 01:22:39.501
- Where's Bea?
- I don't know.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:41.503
Bea.

01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:17.182
Bea!

01:25:17.659 --> 01:25:20.162
Bea!

01:25:21.288 --> 01:25:23.248
<i>Bea!</i>

01:25:26.168 --> 01:25:28.879
You okay?

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:30.964
Never leave me again.

01:25:33.217 --> 01:25:36.428
<i>Over here. Just take my hand. Come on.</i>

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:38.847
There's land.
We can get out here.

01:25:38.931 --> 01:25:42.476
- There's an airway up here.
- That's great.

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:45.395
This might be the way out.

01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:51.818
<i>Let me see it.</i>

01:25:51.902 --> 01:25:54.238
It's fine.
Here, hold this.

01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:01.828
It's fine. It's fine.
Let's just find our way out of here.

01:26:01.912 --> 01:26:04.665
- We should just keep heading up.
- All right.

01:26:04.748 --> 01:26:06.917
Let's go.

01:26:10.379 --> 01:26:13.549
Alex, get down.

01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:16.844
Turn off your light.

01:26:38.907 --> 01:26:41.410
<i>Shh, shh, shh. Don't fucking move.</i>

01:26:54.047 --> 01:26:57.843
Hey.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:34.087
<i>Alex! Alex, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Get off him!</i>

01:27:34.171 --> 01:27:37.257
Stop do-Alex!
What are you doing?

01:27:38.467 --> 01:27:41.053
Oh! Oh, God.

01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:43.764
Oh, my God.

01:27:58.153 --> 01:27:59.905
What?

01:30:13.705 --> 01:30:17.709
- <i>This is stupid.</i>
<i>Why don't we just take the bus?</i>
- <i>The bus.</i>

01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:20.796
- We could take the bus.
Then we could see the country.
- The bus takes forever.

01:30:20.921 --> 01:30:25.008
- I thought that's why we came
here, to experience new things.
- Yeah, I guess.
