00:00.834 --> 00:02.005
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.085 --> 00:03.678
Get her.
It was professional.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.721
Somebody took Trubel?
How did this happen?

00:05.797 --> 00:08.425
I know you're involved in some
secret government organization.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.762
Things are happening.
We have to be prepared.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.813
They're rising.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.393
Loosely translated, it
would mean something like,

00:17.643 --> 00:19.190
free what's hidden.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.614
Let's go.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.736
It's time.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.285
So this is home?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.237
It's safe.
Nobody knows where we are.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.618
I'm not taking any chances
with my son or with you.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.166
Trubel.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.000
Oh, my God.

01:20.998 --> 01:21.999
Trubel.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.006
Can you hear me? Trubel!
Nick.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.089
Nick!

01:29.590 --> 01:31.638
It's Trubel.
I know. Is she alive?

01:31.717 --> 01:33.594
I'm taking her to the hospital.
Stay here. Lock the doors.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.277
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.190
Let's go get them.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.661
Hey, Robby, you should stay home tonight.
More fun to be had here.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.034
Not for us,
unless you're offering.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.453
Not even in your dreams.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.086
We taking any trophies tonight?
I want a trophy.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.300
No, we're not taking
any damn trophies.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.627
I want a rat's ass.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.882
Well, you're not getting it.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.381
We're just gonna have
a little fun. That's all.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.681
Whoo!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.813
it could be a concussion.
I couldn't keep her awake.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.481
She's wearing body armor.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.556
She's a police officer
involved in undercover work.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.726
What do we have?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.779
Female, undercover officer
involved in a violent altercation.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.254
Start running the O2.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.195
Let's get the OR
prepped just in case.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.400
Okay.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.535
Yeah, let's get her up.
Support the neck for me.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.245
Got it.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.500
Get that line ready.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.336
You brought her in?
Yeah, I did.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.180
You gonna stick around?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.256
Yeah, I'll be here.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.900
Okay, I'll be with
you as soon as I can.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.103
This is
gonna be fun.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.501
God, I miss this.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.048
Quiet. Don't want
them to hear us.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.755
Ugh, oh! I don't care if this is a dump.
They might smell that.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.263
Got one, Johnny?

03:41.304 --> 03:43.602
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.109
There.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.111
Mr. Roly-Poly.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.745
Run!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.156
Get him.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.760
I got him!
I got him! Over here!

04:14.087 --> 04:15.384
Got you.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.932
Let me go. Let me go.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.884
Get his pants!

04:18.966 --> 04:21.015
- Let me go!
- Pants him!

04:24.514 --> 04:26.733
Yee-haw!

04:28.935 --> 04:30.187
Oh, whoa.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.443
That wasn't nice.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.774
You shouldn't
have done that.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.992
No, he shouldn't have.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.445
Gonna have to teach this
Reinigen a little respect.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.082
No, no, no.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.413
Come on, rat boy!

04:47.496 --> 04:49.624
Please! Please, stop!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.674
Rat boy! Fat boy!

04:53.710 --> 04:55.712
How's that feel, rat boy?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.141
RiesenRatte!

05:07.224 --> 05:10.228
Oh, my God! It's real.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.695
- Johnny!
- Johnny!

05:12.771 --> 05:14.819
- Don't leave us!
- Johnny, come back!

05:15.065 --> 05:16.442
- Johnny!
- Hap!

05:16.525 --> 05:17.526
Oh, God, please help!

05:17.609 --> 05:18.656
No.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.988
- Johnny!
- It's coming! God!

05:21.071 --> 05:22.618
Johnny, help us!

05:50.308 --> 05:53.608
Nursing assistants
in waiting area for senior care services.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.240
Nursing assistants in waiting
area for senior care services.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.821
Lauren Cole.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.252
Hello?

07:37.707 --> 07:38.924
Where's Burkhardt?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.468
Who is this?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.840
Is she with you?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.046
Who?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.631
I need to know
if she's alive.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.341
Who is this?

07:48.677 --> 07:49.678
Adalind?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.307
Meisner?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.675
Adalind,
everything okay at home?

08:20.750 --> 08:21.842
I don't know.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.420
There was a phone
ringing by your bed.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.675
It was Chavez's phone.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.506
I answered it. I thought
it might be important.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.512
They asked for you.
A man's voice?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.593
Yes.
And he talked to you?

08:30.802 --> 08:34.147
A little. He wanted to
know if she got here.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.313
Trubel?

08:35.390 --> 08:39.111
He didn't say a name, and I wasn't
gonna offer it. There's more.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.402
Not over the phone.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.275
I hope I didn't
screw things up.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.449
I've got to go.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.945
How is she?
Stable.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.281
CAT scan revealed
no internal injuries.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.865
Probably would
have been a lot worse

08:51.948 --> 08:53.428
if she hadn't been
wearing body armor.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.999
Now, I'd like to keep her under observation
for at least another 24 hours.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.417
Can I talk to her?
I just gave her a sedative.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.668
She's still in
a lot of pain.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.840
Just to let her
know that I'm here.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.134
Okay, just for
a couple of minutes.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.570
I knew if I could just
get to you, it'd be okay.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.036
I'm so sorry I didn't...

09:31.112 --> 09:32.159
It's okay.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.999
I'm just glad you're alive.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.663
You have my jacket.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.340
That's good.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.841
Found a few things.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.220
There's so much to...

09:52.592 --> 09:54.094
Just try and get some rest.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.396
They're gonna keep you under
observation for 24 hours.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.769
I think maybe
I can go now.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.895
I actually feel good.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.021
No, no, no.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.523
It's not a good idea.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.605
You've been
given a sedative.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.530
We don't even
have your name yet.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.404
I know you're
a police officer, but...

10:10.985 --> 10:12.328
Lauren Cole.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.245
I can get you the rest
of her information.

10:16.324 --> 10:20.500
Good. Well, Ms. Cole,
you've had a rough night.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.046
You need to
get some rest.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.508
Just try and sleep.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.886
These are her clothes.
Do you have her license?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.346
I do.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.563
Right here.
Thanks.

10:40.140 --> 10:44.361
Oh, and if anything changes, call me.
Here's my card.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.063
Of course. I'll make
a copy of her license.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.900
- Nick, what's up?
- Sorry, it's late.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.695
I got a license plate. Just sent it to you.
I need someone to run it.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.824
When do you need it?

11:35.904 --> 11:37.372
As soon as you
can get it to me.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.120
I've got just the guy.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.617
Hey, Wu.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.036
Everything okay?

11:43.536 --> 11:45.880
That's what I'm trying
to figure out. Thanks.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.134
Uh, why am I here?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.133
To find out who
belongs to this.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.969
How is she?
She's stable.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.264
Could you talk to her?
Not much.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.308
But she knows I
brought her in.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.814
I can't believe she's here.
I thought she was dead.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.404
Is that her motorcycle?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.901
Maybe. She might
have stolen it.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.157
And she's wearing
body armor,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.907
carrying three false
identifications and a lot of cash.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.162
This has got to be
connected to Chavez.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.207
How did she know
to come here?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.499
I don't know.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.996
Look, when you called me,
you said there was more.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.840
Oh, the guy on the phone
recognized my voice.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.885
He said my name, and I think
I recognized his voice.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.259
Who? I'm pretty
sure it's Meisner.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.182
He's the one who got me out of
Europe, took me to your mother.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.095
I am so sorry
this happened.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.681
I thought I'd gotten us
away from all of this.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.273
Wu.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.279
Hey, Hank's with me.
I got you on speaker.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.030
I ran the plates.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.413
Motorcycle is registered
to a Lauren Cole.

13:00.530 --> 13:06.208
3618, North-west, 19th Ave, Apartment 505.
So far, so normal.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.836
Then, I pulled Lauren
Cole's driver's license.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.210
You will never guess who it is.
Trubel.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.213
You wanna tell us
what's going on?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.051
I don't know
what's going on.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.476
She showed up here pretty beat up.
I took her to the hospital.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.598
How bad is she?

13:22.677 --> 13:23.894
There's no
internal bleeding,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.393
but they want to keep her under
observation for 24 hours.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.391
Did she say why
she's Lauren Cole?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.067
No.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.436
You need anything else?

13:31.686 --> 13:35.065
Check out Lauren Cole's apartment,
but do it out of uniform.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.362
Copy.

13:36.899 --> 13:41.029
By the way, Ms. Cole's
motorcycle costs 30 grand,

13:41.571 --> 13:43.039
and that's just
the base model.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.617
Given the fake IDs and the
amount of cash she had on her,

13:45.700 --> 13:47.060
I doubt she's
driving a base model.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.705
I'll check it out, see if there's
anything else I can find.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.916
Nick, good to know
she's still alive.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.590
Yeah.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.299
This is getting
very complicated.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.183
Yeah, it is.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.224
I've got to take
a look at that bike.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.834
Open your eyes, honey. I just
need to check something.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.916
Come on. Open your eyes.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.509
Open your eyes!

15:25.633 --> 15:27.010
That's a good girl.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.908
You go back
to sleep now.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.328
It's her.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.327
We've got her.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.570
She's stabilized.
All her vital signs are good.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.727
Uh, shouldn't she
be awake by now?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.934
I don't know how well
she slept last night,

16:16.017 --> 16:17.644
but after what
she's been through,

16:17.727 --> 16:19.775
it's not unusual to
sleep for quite a while.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.940
How's she doing?

16:23.024 --> 16:25.072
Well, okay, I guess.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.073
Will you call me as
soon as she wakes up?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.370
We Will.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.254
Doctor said her
vitals were good.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.832
I thought she'd
be awake by now.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.758
We have any idea where she was
before she got to your place?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.633
No idea, but you've got to see
this motorcycle she was riding.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.596
Griffin.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.558
Where? Yeah, he's with me.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.560
All right,
we'll be there.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.936
Have to show me the motorcycle later.
We've got a case.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.236
I checked Lauren Cole's apartment.
Address is real.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.484
Name is on the mailbox.
Mailbox is empty.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.404
Her apartment's on the fifth floor,
but it is a secure building.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.655
So you didn't
get inside.

17:06.733 --> 17:07.781
Oh, I got inside.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.020
Couldn't get in
the apartment.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.617
The way to get
in is to break in,

17:10.695 --> 17:13.118
and since you wanted to do this
incognito, didn't push it.

17:13.199 --> 17:17.124
But somebody's gone to a lot
of trouble, the other trouble,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.126
to make Lauren Cole seem real.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.207
You get anything on
the background check?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.213
Nope. Lauren Cole
is clean.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.679
So what do we have here?

17:28.506 --> 17:30.884
Meet Chester
Avery and Robert Kyle.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.220
Truck's registered to
Mr. Kyle on the right.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.428
They're pretty
traumatized.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.855
So are their clothes.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.145
Puncture marks,
scratches all over.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.273
Somebody or somebodies really
wanted these guys to suffer.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.899
My guess is,
it didn't happen here.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.401
Probably dumped in
the truck and left here.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.823
All right, let CSU have it.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.821
Yeah.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.986
One of them has
got a phone.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.044
I'd answer that
if I were you.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.427
Hello?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.758
Where the hell
have you been?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.593
Why aren't you
answering your damn phone?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.394
You know I hate it
when you do this.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.549
This is Detective Burkhardt.
With whom am I speaking?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.982
Oh, God, what did he do now?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.275
We lived together
for three years.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.612
HOW did he die?

18:29.692 --> 18:30.944
We don't know yet.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.371
We found Robert and Chester's
bodies this morning.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.117
We're sorry.
We know this isn't easy.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.872
I wanted him
to stay home.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.920
I knew something was
gonna happen there.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.338
Where's that?

18:43.414 --> 18:44.586
That stupid dump.

18:44.915 --> 18:45.962
What dump?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.294
The quarry on
Oaks Bottom.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.969
Isn't that where
you found them?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.547
We found their
truck in a cornfield.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.008
Someone
drove the truck there.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.892
The bodies were in the back.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.182
And what about Johnny?
Where's he?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.513
There were three of them?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.196
Yeah, they were all
going there together.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.359
Johnny, Chester,
and Robert.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.198
You're a Klaustreich.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.375
Oh, you killed them.
You killed them all!

19:19.450 --> 19:22.249
It wasn't me, and I'm
not gonna hurt you.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.648
We're investigating
their murders.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.917
We don't know who Johnny is, and
we haven't found a third body.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.755
We need your help.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.632
Was Robert
a Klaustreich, too?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.048
Yes.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.966
What about
Chester and Johnny?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.596
We all are.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.269
What were they
doing at the dump?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.596
Having a little bit of fun.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.558
What does that mean?

19:43.641 --> 19:44.858
They look for Reinigen.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.060
Why?

19:47.103 --> 19:48.650
They like to
chase them, you know.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.070
We need to find Johnny.
Do you have his number?

19:52.149 --> 19:54.549
I've been calling him all morning.
He's not answering either.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.328
We need his last name
and where he lives.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.704
It's Rodwick. Johnny's got a
trailer on Wright Island.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.035
I'll get the address.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.292
I'll call Wu, have him visit
Johnny at the trailer.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.294
We need to
check out that dump.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.523
He's gone.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.101
My prince.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.859
My poor boy.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.483
Did you find
the other Klaustreich?

21:15.566 --> 21:17.534
We found his
trailer but not him.

21:17.985 --> 21:22.991
Find him. He's going to pay
for the death of my son.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.636
It's okay.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.185
I'm glad you're awake. You must
have been having a nightmare.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.773
I'm Christi, your nurse.
How are you feeling?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.019
Okay.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.399
I'll go get Dr. Nicholson. He'll want
to see you now that you're awake.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.284
I need to talk to the man
who brought me here.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.616
I'll make sure he knows.

22:11.539 --> 22:15.260
I'm glad you're awake.
I'm Dr. Nicholson.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.589
Do you remember what
happened to you last night?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.007
Not really.
I have to talk to the guy...

22:21.090 --> 22:23.513
Yes, we know. We're
contacting the detective.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.015
I'm just gonna take a look in your eyes.
Look at me.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.347
No, I have to go.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.557
You got hit
pretty hard last night.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.442
I'd like to do
another CAT scan

22:31.517 --> 22:33.485
before we release you,
just to be sure.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.947
Portland,
Oregon, is one of the most

22:40.025 --> 22:41.618
beautiful cities
in the whole world.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.530
I was born here, and I'm proud
to call it my home today.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.991
Hi, I'm Andrew Dixon
and I'm running for mayor

22:47.074 --> 22:48.075
of this great city.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.211
I've been a city councilman
for the last eight years.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.460
My district has been
number one in job creation,

22:53.539 --> 22:55.299
and I've led the fight
for fair business tax,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.586
pension reform,
and wage equality.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.047
Let's do things better,
listen to the people,

23:01.130 --> 23:03.929
pay attention to the details,
and face issues head-on.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.973
Portland has some
tough decisions to make,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.350
and it needs a candidate
strong enough to make them.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.646
My name is Andrew Dixon,
and I'm asking for your vote.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.728
Then we'll have
a narrator say,

23:15.811 --> 23:21.068
"Andrew is heartily endorsed by teachers,
firemen, and Portland police."

23:22.192 --> 23:23.409
What do you think, Sean?

23:23.485 --> 23:24.611
I think it looks good,

23:24.695 --> 23:26.993
and I think you have a great
chance with or without me.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.033
I want you on this team,

23:29.116 --> 23:32.290
and I want you running
this department as chief.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.226
What have you got?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.523
I've been trying
to call you guys.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.025
Just got back from Johnny Rodwick's
trailer on Wright Island.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.777
His place was ransacked.

24:00.856 --> 24:04.030
His car's tires were slashed.
Trailer's front door was kicked in.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.702
Windows broken.
It was a mess.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.113
Did you find Johnny?

24:07.196 --> 24:10.291
No. Checked all around.
No Johnny, no bodies.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.413
Any blood?

24:11.492 --> 24:12.459
No. Doesn't mean
there isn't any.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.036
Got a CSU team
going over it now.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.042
We're checking out
the dump now. Thanks.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.589
You got it.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.209
We think Johnny
killed the other two?

24:20.292 --> 24:21.669
And trashed his own place?

24:21.752 --> 24:23.550
Well, maybe we're not the
only ones looking for him.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.381
Maybe Johnny's still alive.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.388
Unless they found him there,
and he put up a big-ass fight.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.895
How do you want
to deal with this?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.371
Let's see if I can
piss someone off.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.606
Sounds like a plan.

24:35.349 --> 24:36.521
Hey!

24:36.600 --> 24:39.649
I'm Detective Griffin.
This is Detective Burkhardt.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.446
We're investigating
a double homicide.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.149
The victims were
here last night.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.234
I was here last night.
I didn't see anything.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.991
The victims' names are Robert
Kyle and Chester Avery.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.697
What were they
supposedly doing here?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.373
They were Klaustreichs.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.703
Probably just came down here to
chase some Reinigen for sport.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.171
You're under arrest.
For what?

24:57.246 --> 24:58.247
For murder.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.003
Grimm don't scare me.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.427
What are you, some Klaustreich
friend of theirs?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.384
Three Klaustreichs
show up here last night,

25:10.467 --> 25:12.265
and you're not
bothered at all?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.267
Well, you seem to be
a little bothered now.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.520
You want to arrest me, arrest me.
I've got nothing to say.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.942
We're not gonna
arrest you.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.605
We just wanted to know
who we were dealing with.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.402
So we've got
Klaustreich and Reinigen.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.032
But the Klaustreichs
are dead?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.782
Yeah. How'd that happen?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.420
Two detectives were just here
looking for the guys we killed.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.965
I don't give a damn. They're not
gonna find anything out here.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.634
One of them
was a Grimm.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.090
If he comes back,
we'll kill him, too.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.974
If he had just stayed home...

25:55.137 --> 25:58.391
Hold on. You know, I think someone's here.
Let me call you right back.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.731
Johnny?
You need to hide me.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.404
What? You scared the crap out of me.
The police were here.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.902
I thought you were dead.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.358
What happened to
Robby and Chester?

26:07.441 --> 26:09.364
They didn't make it.
I know, but what happened?

26:09.443 --> 26:11.523
There's nothing I could have done.
I barely got away.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.620
You're scaring me, Johnny.

26:12.696 --> 26:13.743
It's not what you think.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.417
The thing that attacked us, it's
like nothing I've ever seen before.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.495
It was huge.
What was huge?

26:20.746 --> 26:23.169
The legend, it's true.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.836
We have two dead Klaustreichs
and a third one missing.

26:27.169 --> 26:30.139
And they went to the dump last
night to chase some Reinigen.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.423
Ugh, Reini bashing.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.430
Yup, Saturday
night at the dump

26:33.509 --> 26:35.352
is a popular
Klaustreich pastime.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.600
Although I've never heard of the
Klaustreichs winding up dead.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.932
No, anyone winds up dead,
it's the Reinigen.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.685
Well, the Reinigen we questioned
wasn't afraid of anything.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.822
Can a Reinigen take
on three Klaustreichs?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.570
And live to tell
about it? No way.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.368
Not unless we're
talking about RiesenRatte.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.329
The Rat King?
Come on. It's not real.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.290
Why not?
Are you kidding me?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.788
A 20-foot tall Ratzilla
that can't be stopped?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.211
I mean, where's a thing
like that gonna hide?

27:01.370 --> 27:03.213
Somebody would have
seen one somewhere.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.256
There might be something
in one of your books.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.711
I'm sure there is, but I'm telling
you, it's just an old rat's tale.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.681
The hospital should
have called by now.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.053
Who's in the hospital?

27:15.217 --> 27:16.719
Trubel came back
last night.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.520
What?
She's alive?

27:18.595 --> 27:21.035
Yeah, she was in a bad fight. I
don't know any more than that.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.484
Haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.136
You don't know where she's
been, what she's been doing?

27:26.186 --> 27:27.403
Nothing.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.071
Saint Joe's.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.155
Hi, this is Detective Burkhardt.
I want to check on a patient.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.990
Uh, Lauren Cole.
Transferring.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.325
Lauren Cole?

27:39.408 --> 27:40.705
Hello, Detective,
this is Nurse Kane.

27:40.784 --> 27:44.038
I'm sorry we haven't called
yet, but she's not awake.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.748
Shouldn't she be
awake by now?

27:45.831 --> 27:49.176
It can take a while when a body's
suffered this much trauma.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.838
I promise, I'll call
as soon as she's awake.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.181
All right.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.592
Lauren.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.136
Lauren.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.680
I need you to wake up.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.688
- Lauren.
- Hmm.

28:04.766 --> 28:05.767
Hey.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.944
How are you doing?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.235
Okay, I guess.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.362
We found something
on your CAT scan.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.995
It appears there's been
swelling in your brain.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.369
We're going to be
moving you to the ICU,

28:19.448 --> 28:21.325
and we're going
to have to operate.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.372
What?

28:28.999 --> 28:31.377
"Few mythological
beings pose a threat

28:31.460 --> 28:33.758
"as powerful as
the RiesenRatte,

28:34.171 --> 28:37.721
"Also known as les
Rongeurs roi or Rat King."

28:38.842 --> 28:40.765
That's kind of a nice drawing.
Don't you think?

28:40.844 --> 28:43.017
Yeah, as long as it stays on
the page, it's beautiful.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.935
Uh, okay, here we go.

28:45.182 --> 28:47.480
This is maybe why one's
never been found before.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.560
"According to legend,

28:48.644 --> 28:52.069
"the RiesenRatte only forms when
the Reinigen are under attack.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.072
"Fueled by fear, scores
of them join together

28:56.151 --> 28:58.574
"in what is known
as the Erklarend."

28:58.654 --> 29:00.782
Join together? What does that mean,
they hold hands or something?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.332
I don't know.
Hold on. There's more.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.160
"These Reinigen have
little genetic diversity.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.587
"In their Woged state,

29:06.662 --> 29:09.757
"they appear to stimulate the
growth of cancer-like cells.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.708
"As these cells
cannot differentiate

29:11.792 --> 29:13.590
"which body is
the original vector,

29:13.669 --> 29:15.046
"they merge into
each other,

29:15.128 --> 29:19.099
"causing the individual to become
part of the greater whole."

29:21.343 --> 29:22.686
Anyone understand that?

29:23.011 --> 29:25.764
I think it means the whole is
worse than the sum of its parts.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.942
I don't like rats. I don't
care what size they are.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.523
Hello?

29:34.606 --> 29:35.949
They're here.
They've come for Johnny.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.025
Selina? Where are you?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.736
They found Johnny
hiding at my place.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.446
They said they're gonna
take him back to the quarry

29:40.529 --> 29:42.156
and make him pay
for what he did.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.791
Oh, god! Help me! Help me!

29:46.618 --> 29:48.586
Let me go! No!

29:50.956 --> 29:51.957
Selina.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.300
They have Johnny?

29:54.376 --> 29:55.576
Sounds like
they have her, too.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.963
Well, if you're dealing with the
Rat King, we're going with you.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.047
Uh, we are?

29:59.715 --> 30:01.388
Oh, no, yeah, we are.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.746
You got
an extra flashlight?

30:26.366 --> 30:28.334
if they have him
here, where are they?

30:28.410 --> 30:29.707
Well, first of all,
how many are there?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.038
We have no idea.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.584
How many does it
take to make a Rat King?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.294
That wasn't
in the book.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.930
- You getting something?
- Yeah, a lot of somethings.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.466
None of them
very helpful.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.681
Wait.

30:46.762 --> 30:47.809
I hear something.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.778
There! I see him.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.358
Where'd he go?

30:59.441 --> 31:00.738
Sounds like
from in there.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.449
This whole mound could be
some kind of nest.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.748
You think they're inside?

31:07.824 --> 31:09.167
If there is an inside.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.291
Oh, there's got to be
an opening somewhere.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.102
Hey. Think I found it.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.524
What have you got?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.649
Some kind of tunnel.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.840
Ugh,
it stinks in here.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.840
Yeah, anybody else
getting the creeps?

32:02.045 --> 32:03.513
There's a switch.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.135
Whoa. Some dump.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.936
What the hell is this place?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.854
Looks like some
kind of throne room.

32:12.514 --> 32:13.936
Oh, my God.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.269
- We're too late.
- Must be Johnny.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.357
Can't call it in from here.
No service.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.161
Guys, over here.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.451
They killed him.
They all took turns.

32:32.993 --> 32:36.247
They made me watch.
It was so horrible.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.571
We've got you now.
You're safe.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.048
Where'd they go?

32:39.666 --> 32:40.713
Everywhere.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.585
They were about to start
on me when someone ran in.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.132
Next thing I knew, they were all
running in different directions.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.557
Let's get her
out of here.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.009
You're gonna be okay.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.816
All right, let's get Selina back
to the car and call this in.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.017
Uh...

32:57.559 --> 32:59.186
Nick. Nick!

32:59.269 --> 33:00.395
Don't let him get me.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.368
You shouldn't
have come, Grimm.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.862
This is not your fight.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.739
You murdered
three people.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.082
They came here
looking to hurt us.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.828
Leave that
Klaustreich and go.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.255
No. No, please don't
leave me. He'll kill me.

33:19.247 --> 33:23.093
I didn't do anything to you.
I told them not to come here!

33:23.168 --> 33:26.297
You hid my son's killer.
You're as guilty as they are.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.932
You try anything, and you're
the first one to go down.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.512
You're under the
arrest for the murders

33:30.592 --> 33:31.935
of Robert Kyle,
Chester Avery...

33:32.052 --> 33:33.645
They killed the prince!
...and Johnny Rodwick.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.812
They came to kill us!

33:34.888 --> 33:35.889
They killed our prince!

33:35.972 --> 33:38.350
Never. We deserve revenge.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.525
Never!

33:39.601 --> 33:40.602
You need to leave or die!

33:40.685 --> 33:41.732
Never!

33:48.068 --> 33:49.490
Where are they going?

34:14.219 --> 34:15.344
What the hell?

34:17.472 --> 34:19.315
It's the RiesenRatte.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.188
I guess it's not
such a myth.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.119
Don't kill me.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.829
Keep her back.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.626
How are we supposed to stop this
thing if we can't shoot it?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.382
I don't know. It's not
supposed to be real.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.652
Well, we better figure out
another way to deal with this.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.340
Yeah. Run!

34:45.375 --> 34:46.752
We're gonna need
a pretty big trap.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.263
I'm also thinking
we're pretty good bait!

34:50.338 --> 34:51.635
Through there!

35:00.265 --> 35:03.360
Okay, just for the record, this
is not a good hiding place.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.062
We're not hiding.
What are we doing?

35:05.145 --> 35:06.192
He's gonna kill us.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.318
We have to get
him under the wire.

35:07.397 --> 35:08.398
What? Why?

35:08.773 --> 35:09.945
We need a trap,
and that might be it.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.117
Might be?

35:17.907 --> 35:19.079
Well, he's not moving.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.439
We need to get
him tangled in it.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.453
How?

35:21.536 --> 35:22.537
You need to Woge.

35:22.704 --> 35:25.082
What? No, he'll kill me.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.845
If you don't do it,
he's gonna kill us all.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.925
I can't.
Do it!

35:40.597 --> 35:41.644
You want her?

35:43.391 --> 35:44.643
Come get her!

35:56.571 --> 35:57.868
Shoot the power line.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.331
Any time, Hank.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.352
HANK; I think it worked.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.141
Is it dead?

36:21.221 --> 36:22.564
It's not moving.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.277
Do you think the high voltage
could have, like, pulled it back apart?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.073
I did not
see that coming.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.455
There really are
no winners in this.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.350
Oh, my God.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.518
Good luck.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.981
If it hadn't been for you, I'd
have been dead a long time ago.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.211
I don't have much time.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.211
I'm glad you're all right.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.256
You, too.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.057
I'll tell you as much as I
can, but I have to see her.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.979
Who?
Trubel.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.729
I know she's here.
I tracked her bike's GPS.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.983
My boyfriend and two of my
friends are dead because of them.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.657
Um... Not to be
argumentative, you know, considering,

38:37.732 --> 38:41.657
but they did all come up here for a
little Reini bashing. Did they not?

38:43.738 --> 38:44.990
Hello?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.167
Trubel's life is in danger.
Where did you take her?

38:47.242 --> 38:48.289
Who is this?

38:48.368 --> 38:49.995
There isn't time.
I know she came to you.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.797
No, I'm not telling you anything
until you tell me who this is.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.924
Nick, it's me.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.927
Adalind. Where are you?

38:58.002 --> 39:00.505
At home. It's Meisner.
He's here with me.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.807
I didn't know he was
coming, but I trust him.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.718
Listen, you need to
tell me where she is.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.521
If you won't, you need to go to her.
They'll find her.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.517
Saint Joe's.
I'll meet you there.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.355
I've got to go to
the hospital. It's Trubel.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.780
I'll handle this.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.137
Excuse me.
Where is Lauren Cole?

39:41.254 --> 39:45.225
I'm sorry. She's been
moved to intensive care.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.521
I have an emergency.

40:35.850 --> 40:36.942
Check in upstairs.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.817
You don't understand.
This is the emergency!

40:52.700 --> 40:53.792
Burkhardt.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.551
Meisner.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.433
Get her out.
I'll get the other one.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.628
You know, I'm getting a
little sick of hearing that.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.048
Bed's ready.

41:49.799 --> 41:52.427
Nick, they're
gonna take me.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.142
Not anymore.
You're with me.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.645
I have so much to tell you.
Shh.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.480
Later.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.188
Is she all right?

42:04.397 --> 42:05.649
Yeah, thanks to
your friend.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.533
He was there?

42:09.444 --> 42:11.287
Tell me about Meisner.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.745
I need to know
who he is.
