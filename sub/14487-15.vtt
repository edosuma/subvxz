HERMES:
You better believe it.

19:17.172 --> 19:18.481
Great Shatner's ghost!

19:18.550 --> 19:22.275
We demand that all TV
be equipped with a B-chip

19:22.344 --> 19:24.586
that blocks Bender
from appearing on the screen.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.000
[ all agreeing]

19:28.034 --> 19:31.931
I'm afraid the answer is a
gritty, in-your-face no.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.034
Then I quit.

19:33.103 --> 19:34.517
Then you don't quit.

19:37.689 --> 19:40.792
I think you'll be finishing
the scene now, Mr. Bender

19:40.862 --> 19:42.689
and don't skimp on the nasty.

19:42.758 --> 19:44.517
There'll be no
further nasty.

19:44.586 --> 19:47.826
We still have the option
of resorting to violence.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.862
What makes you think
that will work?

19:49.931 --> 19:54.172
I saw it on TV in that episode
where Bender shot Calculon.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.723
How cool was that.

19:55.792 --> 19:56.862
♪ Ooh, yeah, come on... ♪

19:56.931 --> 19:58.172
[ sputtering]

19:58.240 --> 19:59.378
Quit the show.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.862
Do the scene.

20:00.931 --> 20:02.931
I'm a cold-blooded punk.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.619
I once put a laugh track on a
sitcom that had no jokes in it.

20:06.689 --> 20:08.964
Hey, look, the prop guy
has a lamp.

20:09.034 --> 20:10.205
Whuh...?
Really?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.517
Aha!

20:11.586 --> 20:13.240
I was using that.

20:13.309 --> 20:15.895
Listen up, 'cause I've got
a climatic speech.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.378
You, cameraman,
keep the camera rolling.

20:18.448 --> 20:20.689
You, director,
give me my motivation.

20:20.758 --> 20:21.586
You're angry.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.723
Perfect.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.481
Viewers of the world

20:24.550 --> 20:28.103
do smoking and drinking on TV
really make me cool?

20:28.172 --> 20:30.448
Of course they do.

20:30.517 --> 20:32.689
How about committing
crimes and violence?

20:32.758 --> 20:34.378
Again, the answer is yes.

20:34.448 --> 20:36.826
But do we really want
our kids exposed

20:36.895 --> 20:38.689
to that kind of trash on TV?

20:38.758 --> 20:41.275
I say absolutely not.

20:42.792 --> 20:44.413
[ clearing throat]

20:44.481 --> 20:48.689
Uh... on the other hand,
most... perhaps all the blame

20:48.758 --> 20:50.103
rests with the parents.

20:50.172 --> 20:51.586
That's right, you.

20:51.654 --> 20:53.619
[ all gasping]

20:53.689 --> 20:57.067
And so I ask you
this one question:

20:57.136 --> 21:01.136
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV

21:01.205 --> 21:05.000
sitting down with your children
and hitting them?

21:05.067 --> 21:07.000
We're just so busy.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.344
Well, make time.

21:08.413 --> 21:09.826
And... cut.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.586
Good enough.

21:11.654 --> 21:13.654
Splice in some
reaction shots of me

21:13.723 --> 21:15.275
and shove it
on the air.

21:17.792 --> 21:21.067
Have you ever tried
simply turning off the TV

21:21.136 --> 21:24.931
sitting down with your children
and hitting them?

21:26.517 --> 21:28.448
Well, I'd say we all
learned a valuable lesson

21:28.517 --> 21:30.344
about TV there.

21:30.413 --> 21:31.723
What was it?

21:31.792 --> 21:35.931
Uh, that we should all take TV
a little less seriously.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.895
And more importantly,
turn it off once in a while.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.964
Hear! Hear!
Darn right.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.000
So, should we turn it off now?

21:43.067 --> 21:46.309
Well, uh... that depends
what's on.

21:46.378 --> 21:47.205
[ control beeping]

21:47.275 --> 21:48.586
Nothing good.
