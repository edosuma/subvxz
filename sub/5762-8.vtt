WEBVTT

00:10.240 --> 00:12.485
Hey, By The Way, Thanks For
Keepin' Me Company.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.310
And Miss A Chance To Ride Out
To The Country? Sure.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.420
Maybe You And Jim
Will Move Out Here Someday.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.455
No. Jim Is A City Boy.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.975
I Think Village Square Is About As Country
As He's Gonna Get.

00:22.393 --> 00:23.995
I Never Thought
This House Would Sell.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.730
Yeah, You And Me Both.

00:26.050 --> 00:28.206
It's Changed Hands
4 Times In 10 Years.

00:28.207 --> 00:30.907
Well, You Know What They Say. 
It Is The Most Haunted House...

00:30.908 --> 00:32.470
 In Driscoll County.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.807
I Think It's Not Selling
'Cause It's A Money Pit,

00:35.810 --> 00:37.000
Not Because Of
The Ghosts.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.300
Wow. This From You?

00:38.305 --> 00:40.575
Vacant Houses Usually
Aren't Haunted.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.300
No?

00:41.305 --> 00:43.703
They Need The Energy Of The Living
To Feed Off Of.

00:43.706 --> 00:45.204
There Are More Ghosts
In Dentists' Offices

00:45.205 --> 00:47.139
Than There Are In An Abandoned House
Like This.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.339
Oh. Well, That Must Explain
My Dentist's Bad Breath.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.550
Eww.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.240
Hey! My First Guests.
Come On In.

00:55.245 --> 00:57.500
Hey. Steve, I-- I Hope You Don't Mind
I Brought A Friend.

00:57.505 --> 00:59.156
This Is Melinda Rdon.
Hi.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.359
I'm Sorry. I Just Had
Hand-To-Hand Combat With A Saw,

01:02.360 --> 01:03.527
And The Saw Won.

01:03.594 --> 01:04.694
Ouch.
Yeah.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.559
That Word Came In Handy
A Lot Today,

01:06.560 --> 01:08.144
Along With A Few Others, Huh?

01:08.460 --> 01:11.410
Well, I Was Just Stopping By To See How
You Were Settling In,

01:11.415 --> 01:12.257
If You Needed Anything.

01:12.260 --> 01:15.381
Uh, Yeah, A How-To Book
On Power Tools.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.400
This Is My Daughter.

01:16.405 --> 01:18.120
Hi. Marlo,
Pioneer Girl.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.305
Do Your Horses
Need Some Feed?

01:19.350 --> 01:20.960
Wagon Wheels
Need A-Fixin'?

01:21.100 --> 01:24.450
Marlo's Just Annoyed
Because The Closest Mall Is 10 Miles Away.

01:24.730 --> 01:27.909
No, I'm Annoyed Because My Friends Are
A Hundred Miles Away.

01:27.910 --> 01:29.109
Anyway, I Just Have
A Couple Papers

01:29.110 --> 01:31.110
I Need You To Sign
From The Title Company.

01:31.115 --> 01:31.820
Yeah, Sure.

01:33.665 --> 01:35.570
You Know,
I Think I'm Gonna Clean Up My Thumb.

01:35.732 --> 01:36.972
I'd Rather
Not Sign In Blood.

01:36.975 --> 01:38.990
Well, You're Gonna,
Whether You Want To Or Not.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.795
Hey, You Work At An Antique Store,
Too, Don't You?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.390
Uh, Yeah.
That's My Boss.

01:45.000 --> 01:45.925
Oh. Hi.

01:46.100 --> 01:46.800
Hi.

01:46.805 --> 01:48.471
I Found Some Really Cool
Old Board Games.

01:48.472 --> 01:50.500
I Was Gonna
Keep Some Of Them--

01:51.000 --> 01:53.155
There's Not A Ton Of Entertainment Here
At The Homestead.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.260
But I Was Wondering If You Could
Tell Me What They're Worth?

01:55.860 --> 01:57.273
Sure. I Could
Take A Look At 'Em.

01:57.275 --> 01:58.040
Oh, Perfect.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.500
Have You Ever Heard
Of A Game Called, Uh...

02:00.730 --> 02:01.705
Twister?

02:04.900 --> 02:06.602
You Wanna Come And
Check Out The Games?

02:06.606 --> 02:07.939
No. I'm Good.
I'm Just Gonna Explore.

02:08.100 --> 02:08.723
Ok.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.200
Yep. This Game.
I'm Not Sure If All The Pieces Are Here, Though.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.271
This Is A Great Game,
Yahtzee.

02:15.272 --> 02:16.205
You've Never Played?

02:16.272 --> 02:16.725
Never Played It.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.706 --> 02:42.550
Is Someone Here?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.680
Hello.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.585
Hello.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.820
I Can Help You.

03:11.260 --> 03:12.275
Who Are You?

03:14.730 --> 03:16.246
One Of Them
Will Die.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.130
Are You Ok?

Wonder When This Tipped.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.760
Floor's Rotted Through
Underneath.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.310
Made A Little River
All Through The Ceiling.

04:24.401 --> 04:25.315
What A Mess.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.600
I'm Gonna See
If Marlo's Finished Cleanin' Herself Up,

04:28.605 --> 04:30.197
And I'll Bring Up
Some Paper Towels And...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.072
I'll Bring Her
Back Up Here.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.835
You Know, For
A Minute There...

04:37.100 --> 04:38.546
You Almost Thought
There Was A Ghost?

04:38.550 --> 04:39.296
No.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.170
Have To Remember My Rule.

04:41.501 --> 04:42.430
What Rule?

04:42.800 --> 04:47.175
Rational Explanation
For Almost Everything.

04:47.860 --> 04:48.660
Right.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.610
 Do You Know
Why They Moved?

05:06.933 --> 05:09.434
You Know, Steve Lost
His Wife A Few Years Back.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.906
He Said That Marlo
Was Having

05:11.433 --> 05:12.500
A Hard Time
In High School,

05:12.806 --> 05:14.600
And I Guess It Was
Just Too Painful

05:14.603 --> 05:15.400
To Stay In The House.

05:15.403 --> 05:16.750
Oh, That Is So Sad.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.070
It's Really Hard On A Kid
When They Lose A Parent.

05:21.650 --> 05:22.365
Yeah.

05:22.849 --> 05:24.800
It Can Be Hard On
The Other Parent, Too.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.482
So Do You Know What Happened?

05:29.485 --> 05:31.450
Do You Know Why She Died?

05:31.452 --> 05:33.540
No. He Didn't Say.
I Don't Know If...

05:35.550 --> 05:37.749
Wait. I Know That Tone
In Your Voice.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.207
You Are Asking
For A Reason.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.353
I Saw Something, Someone.

05:43.650 --> 05:46.580
Are You Saying That You Saw
A Ghost In Steve's House?

05:46.770 --> 05:48.031
In The Garage, Actually.

05:49.037 --> 05:51.025
What?
It's Just That--

05:51.137 --> 05:53.537
I Mean, There's
Always A Damn Ghost

05:53.540 --> 05:56.060
Everywhere You Go.
What Is That?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.086
Ok, I Wish They Weren't
Always There, Too, Believe Me.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.700
But It's Not Like
I Go Out Looking For Them.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.050
Don't You?

06:04.070 --> 06:04.710
What?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.605
Look, I'm Sorry.

06:09.034 --> 06:10.534
It's Just That
Marlo And Steve

06:10.535 --> 06:11.901
Have Been Through
So Much.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.545
They Just Need
A Clean Start.

06:13.735 --> 06:15.200
They Don't Need
To Hear About Ghosts

06:15.201 --> 06:16.967
And Have Their Whole
Lives Turned Around.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.301
Yeah, But What If The Ghost
Is Marlo's Mother?

06:19.368 --> 06:21.700
Melinda, They Especially
Don't Need To Hear That.

06:21.701 --> 06:23.180
They Need Time To Heal.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.752
There's Obviously A--

06:24.756 --> 06:27.140
A Rational Explanation.
Well, It's Not Always That Easy.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.050
I Am Just Asking You
To Give Them Some Peace.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.000
It's Up To The Ghost, Not Me.

06:37.516 --> 06:38.200
Fine.

06:39.017 --> 06:40.511
You're Gonna Do
What You're Gonna Do.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.417
I Just Sometimes
Don't Understand Her.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.100
I Mean, What's It Gonna Take,
You Know?

06:51.101 --> 06:52.554
After All She's Seen,
She Can't Just Say,

06:52.701 --> 06:54.001
"Ok, I Get It.
There's Ghosts."

06:54.068 --> 06:56.500
Well, Sometimes
What People Don't Believe

06:56.504 --> 06:58.437
Is Just As Important To Them
As What They Do Believe,

06:59.000 --> 07:00.353
And Some People Feel Better

07:00.356 --> 07:02.420
Thinkin' That There's
Nothin' After We Die.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.985
You Didn't Have
A Hard Time Believing.

07:05.630 --> 07:07.813
Well, It Was
Because I Believed You.

07:08.463 --> 07:10.100
Also, I Don't Know...

07:10.830 --> 07:11.666
What?

07:12.563 --> 07:13.700
Come On.

07:14.062 --> 07:14.943
I Always Wanted
To Believe.

07:15.430 --> 07:17.312
I Mean, I Always
Wanted To Believe That There Was More.

07:17.510 --> 07:18.856
I Mean,
After My Father Died,

07:19.144 --> 07:21.200
I Wanted To Think
That Everything We Do Here

07:21.205 --> 07:22.650
Does Not Come To Nothing.
And Then...

07:25.700 --> 07:26.600
There Was Melinda.

07:28.850 --> 07:30.175
So What Do You Think?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.280
Should I Just
Stay Out Of It,

07:32.285 --> 07:33.745
Let The Family
Live In Peace?

07:33.785 --> 07:35.925
Hey, Who Says
They're In Peace?

07:36.519 --> 07:39.318
I Think You Can Cross This Ghost
Over Quickly And Quietly--

07:39.385 --> 07:40.818
In, Out, Nobody Gets Hurt.

07:40.820 --> 07:43.118
Ha. Famous Last Words.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.410
Are You Here?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.255
You Scared Me.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.756
What Are You Doing
In My Garage?

08:42.756 --> 08:46.191
I'm Sorry.
Um, It's Just That The, Uh--

08:46.258 --> 08:49.200
The Furniture,
It's So Interesting.

08:49.205 --> 08:51.710
Um, We Could Sell Some Of It
For You If You Wanted.

08:54.870 --> 08:56.525
I Had A Little Something
For Marlo.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.330
That's Ok. I'd Like To Give It
To Her Myself, If I Could.

09:04.030 --> 09:07.077
It's Adorable.
Thank You So Much.

09:07.080 --> 09:07.800
It Suits Her.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.109
I Have To Keep Her
In Here,

09:10.110 --> 09:12.347
'Cause My Dad's
Not Crazy About Cats.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.340
How's Your Dad Doing?
He Seemed--

09:14.574 --> 09:15.347
Moody?

09:15.574 --> 09:17.228
Right.

09:17.230 --> 09:19.580
He's Been Doin' Pretty
Well Since My Mom Died.

09:20.898 --> 09:22.115
What Was Her Name?

09:22.197 --> 09:24.825
Liz. Short For Lisbeth.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.370
She Hated
Being Called Lisbeth.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.510
Must Be Hard For You,

09:38.770 --> 09:40.425
Moving And All,
Not Knowing Anyone.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.905
She Got Me.

09:46.051 --> 09:46.837
What?

09:47.720 --> 09:48.450
My Mom.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.120
She--She Got Me.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.075
She Was The Only One.

09:57.627 --> 09:58.727
Well, I'm Sure
Your Father--

09:58.730 --> 09:59.374
I Know.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.667
But Not Like Her.

10:04.910 --> 10:06.570
Now I Don't Think
Anybody Ever Will.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.245
Sometimes I Think He Blames Me
For What Happened.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.205
What Happened?

10:23.450 --> 10:24.451
Where's Dora?

10:26.883 --> 10:29.280
I Hope She Didn't Go
In My Dad's Room.

10:29.970 --> 10:30.660
Hang On.

10:40.980 --> 10:41.673
Liz?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.310
What Happened?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.599
The Cat, It Died.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.895
What Did You Do To Her?

10:57.434 --> 10:59.245
I Didn't
Do Anything To Her.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.325
I Just Found Her
Like That.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.278
Might Have Been Some
Rat Poison Or Something.

11:05.350 --> 11:06.585
I'm Sorry, Honey.

11:13.350 --> 11:14.685
Steve, Are You Ok?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.259
Yeah.

11:18.350 --> 11:20.204
She Sure Did
Like That Cat.

11:34.466 --> 11:35.289
Yeah?

11:35.566 --> 11:38.033
Hey. Steve.
I'm So Sorry To Bug You,

11:38.099 --> 11:40.823
But I Just Thought
I Could Walk You Through These County Tax...

11:42.300 --> 11:43.580
Rebate Forms.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.259
You Know,
It's A Great Program,

11:46.260 --> 11:48.540
Especially If You
Plan On Putting Any Money Into The Place.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.031
What's Wrong
With The Place?

11:50.429 --> 11:53.104
Well, You Know.
I Mean, Whatever You Do

11:53.105 --> 11:54.670
For Improvements,
Things Like That.

11:54.671 --> 11:56.061
I Like The Place
Just The Way It Is.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.124
Ok. Well, Then,
Um, I Could Just--

11:59.125 --> 11:59.925
Just Forget It.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.078
If It Makes Life Easier,
He's Not Interested.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.780
Yeah, Well, You're The Expert
On Easy Livin'.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.367
Never Do Today What You Can Put Off
Till Tomorrow, Right?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.019
What Are You Saying?
I'm Lazy?

12:09.066 --> 12:10.500
You Didn't Think I Was Lazy

12:10.501 --> 12:12.885
When Certain Things Had To Be Done
To A Certain Person.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.650
I Should Have
Stopped You.

12:15.220 --> 12:16.185
That's Easy To Say Now,

12:16.930 --> 12:18.663
But You Had Too Much
To Gain, Didn't You?

12:18.664 --> 12:21.315
As Long As I Was Doing It,
You Weren't Gonna Stand In My Way.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.730
You Know, It Looks Like
I Came At A Bad Time,

12:24.735 --> 12:26.967
So I'm Just Gonna
Leave These Over Here.

12:26.968 --> 12:28.445
Bad Time For What?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.355
Um, To Sign
The Tax Rebate Form.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.629
It's Ok.
I Can Just Leave It.

12:33.633 --> 12:34.920
If I Sign It, Will You
Get The Hell Out Of Here?

12:36.700 --> 12:38.070
Um, Yeah.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.803
It Was Like They Were
2 Different People.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.037
It Was So Eerie.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.865
Like They Were
In A Trance?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.738
Yeah, Exactly.
And They Kept Talking About

12:58.739 --> 13:00.167
Having Done Something
To Somebody,

13:00.439 --> 13:05.019
And Marlo Said That Her Dad
Had Too Much To Gain To Stop Her. Weird.

13:05.165 --> 13:07.250
Could They Have Been Talking About
Marlo's Mother?

13:08.233 --> 13:12.336
Well, Why Would You Think
Steve Would Have Done Something
To The Mother Of His Child?

13:12.650 --> 13:13.620
Because Of This.

13:14.870 --> 13:17.650
"Liz Sinclair, 36,
Of Oak Hills Died

13:17.655 --> 13:19.207
"In A Fatal Fall
From A Hiking Trail

13:19.210 --> 13:21.355
"In The Northwest Section
Of Ryden State Park.

13:21.454 --> 13:24.410
"Her Hiking Companions,
Husband Steven Sinclair, 37,

13:24.417 --> 13:27.310
"And Daughter Marlo, 15,
Were Unharmed.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.750
"Sinclair Was Questioned
Late Into The Night

13:29.756 --> 13:32.107
"By The County Sheriff And
Released The Next Morning.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.676
Officials Would Make
No Further Comment."

13:33.677 --> 13:34.834
Yeah. Well, Obviously
They Let Him Go.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.837
Yeah, Which Only Means
They Had No Proof.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.865
I Mean, It Could Explain
Why Liz Is Haunting Him.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.116
Then Again,
Marlo Did Say That Steve Blames Her.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.017
Maybe She's
Haunting Marlo.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.500
Wait, Wait, Wait.
Just Hold On.

13:43.860 --> 13:44.854
Did You Say Anything

13:44.855 --> 13:47.120
The Last Time You Were There
About Ghosts Or Hauntings?

13:47.121 --> 13:48.100
No.

13:48.354 --> 13:49.318
Are You Sure?

13:49.554 --> 13:50.880
Yeah, Of Course
I'm Sure. Why?

13:51.087 --> 13:52.621
I Don't Know.
Maybe It's Like

13:52.688 --> 13:53.954
Power Of Suggestion,
You Know?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.081
They Think They're Haunted,

13:55.082 --> 13:56.520
So Then They Just
Start Acting Like It.

13:56.521 --> 13:57.914
Ok, I Love You

13:58.130 --> 14:00.221
Like A Sister,
Really, I Do,

14:00.222 --> 14:02.530
But You Are The Most
Stubborn Person

14:02.532 --> 14:03.856
I Have Met
In My Entire Life.

14:03.932 --> 14:06.048
I Mean, You Will Twist Yourself Up
Into A Pretzel

14:06.050 --> 14:07.209
Trying To
Rationalize Some--

14:07.210 --> 14:10.069
I'm Sorry, I'm Just Looking For A Logical
Reason For Them To--

14:10.070 --> 14:13.059
Oh, You Mean The Believable Reason,
Not The Real Reason,

14:13.520 --> 14:14.677
But The Easy Reason.

14:16.870 --> 14:18.064
Whatever Makes You
Comfortable.

14:24.255 --> 14:25.237
Let Me Get This Straight.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.900
Daddy And Daughter Move To The Country
To Get Away From It All.

14:27.902 --> 14:29.190
There's A Ghost In
The Garage That Predicts

14:29.193 --> 14:30.876
That One Of Them
Will Be Dead Soon.

14:30.883 --> 14:32.626
The Cat Turns Up Somewhat Less
Than Alive,

14:32.627 --> 14:35.900
And Daddy Buries It Like It's Just Another
Day Of Yardwork.

14:35.901 --> 14:36.800
And This Morning...

14:36.807 --> 14:38.380
And This Morning, Delia
Goes Over To The House

14:38.385 --> 14:40.873
And Finds Herself In The Middle Of <I>Who's Afraid</I>
 <I>Of Virginia Woolf?</I>

14:41.050 --> 14:41.820
What Are You Doing?

14:42.030 --> 14:43.803
Oh. I'm, Uh--I'm Trying

14:43.806 --> 14:46.271
A Radical New Technique
To My Class Lectures.

14:46.272 --> 14:47.830
What?
Preparation.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.556
Ok, So What Am I
Looking At With This Ghost?

14:50.700 --> 14:51.960
You're Looking At, Uh...

14:52.199 --> 14:54.375
A Little More Jack Nicholson,
Little Less Linda Blair.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.433
Meaning?

14:55.435 --> 14:57.944
Meaning It's Not Like There's A Demon
Taking Over Their Bodies.

14:57.945 --> 15:00.900
It Sounds Like There's A Spirit Influencing Them
From The Outside,

15:00.905 --> 15:03.311
Controlling Their Behavior
From Time To Time.

15:03.315 --> 15:04.650
It's Called "Oppression."

15:05.045 --> 15:06.181
You Mean "Possession."

15:06.185 --> 15:08.700
No. I Say What I Mean.
I Mean What I Say, Damn It.

15:08.702 --> 15:10.095
I Said, "Oppression."

15:10.320 --> 15:12.208
Ok, Oppression. Sorry.
Never Heard Of It.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.823
Basically It's When A Spirit
Controls A Body

15:15.825 --> 15:17.730
Without Ever
Entering Inside Of It.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.762
It's A Bit Like
Hypnotic Suggestion.

15:19.769 --> 15:22.509
In Essence, It Directs How It Wants
The Body To Behave,

15:22.515 --> 15:23.900
And What's Really Creepy
Is Over Time,

15:23.909 --> 15:26.415
The Person Begins To Act More And More
Like That Ghost.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.334
It's Possession Lite,
If You Will.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.307
It's All The Bad Manners
With Half The Head-Spinning.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.825
Ok, So Why Not Go
Full-On Possession?

15:33.070 --> 15:35.989
Ah, Possession,
That's A Tool Used By Demons,

15:35.990 --> 15:38.100
Spirits That Never Walked The Earth
In Human Form,

15:38.103 --> 15:40.976
Whereas Oppression These
Are--These Are Used By Earthbound Spirits,

15:40.983 --> 15:42.796
Earthbound Spirits
That Are Very Stubborn

15:43.260 --> 15:44.450
And Will Do Whatever
It Takes To Get What They Want.

15:44.517 --> 15:45.440
Which Is?

15:45.650 --> 15:47.607
That's For The Ghost To Know And For You
To Find Out.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.942
Ok, So How Do I Get The Ghost
To Stop, To Leave Them Alone?

15:49.943 --> 15:53.421
That's Hard To Say.
I'm Not Sure,But I Do Know This.

15:53.422 --> 15:55.131
You Have To Be Careful, Because
An Oppressive Spirit

15:55.132 --> 15:58.500
They Will Really Take Advantage
Of Any Weakness,

15:58.505 --> 16:00.570
Any Vulnerability
That Their Host Has--

16:00.575 --> 16:02.429
A Mental Illness,
Emotional Turmoil.

16:02.430 --> 16:05.796
Turmoil Like,"I Killed A Loved One"?
That Kind Of Turmoil?

16:06.600 --> 16:09.473
Oh. Ok, I Was Thinking
More Like White Slacks In November,

16:09.474 --> 16:11.253
But Sure,
That Would Work Also.

16:36.880 --> 16:37.770
Steve?

16:55.740 --> 16:58.955
Hey. Uh, I-I'm Sorry That I Didn't
Call First. I Just--

17:00.270 --> 17:02.467
You Play From Your Head,
Not Your Heart.

17:02.671 --> 17:03.884
That's Why You Lose.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.936
I Don't Always Lose.

17:07.684 --> 17:09.270
Sometimes Just Let You Win.

17:09.517 --> 17:10.609
Why?

17:11.050 --> 17:12.329
Mess With Your Head
A Little Bit,

17:13.339 --> 17:15.040
False Confidence--
Things Like That.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.130
Heh. You Think
I'm Falsely Confident?

17:17.319 --> 17:19.575
Why Don't You Make Yourself
Useful And Go Get Me A Drink?

17:20.119 --> 17:21.464
Good Idea.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.140
Liz?

17:35.650 --> 17:36.737
Stop It!

17:38.900 --> 17:40.920
You're Not Liz Sinclair.
Who Are You?

17:41.150 --> 17:42.324
You See Me,
Don't You?

17:42.325 --> 17:43.092
Leave Them Alone.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.165
Matt, We Have More Company.

17:50.930 --> 17:54.080
Whoa. It's Scary
When They Look Right At You Like That.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.613
Marlo, Look, I Don't Know
If You Can Hear Me,

18:01.445 --> 18:02.700
But You're Being Used.

18:03.445 --> 18:06.590
I--I Know That You Can't See Them, But You--
You Can Feel Them.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.712
Steve,
Please Listen To Me, Ok?

18:09.717 --> 18:11.055
You Don't Know
What's Happening.

18:13.350 --> 18:15.250
Both Of You Get Out
Of This House Right Now!

18:23.150 --> 18:24.383
 Steve.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.360
What Did You Do?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.310
??

18:40.000 --> 18:40.800
My Daughter.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.590
Where's My Daughter?

18:43.900 --> 18:45.725
She Right Here.
She's Fine.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.810
She's Goin'
With You.

18:47.530 --> 18:49.450
Hey, Stay With
These 2 Guys.

18:49.455 --> 18:50.556
They'll Take Care
Of You, All Right?

18:57.540 --> 18:58.900
You're Playing
Too Rough.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.800
You're Gonna Break Them
Like You Broke The Others.

19:00.804 --> 19:02.039
You're Just A Sore Loser.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.000
No, I Am Not.

19:03.005 --> 19:05.277
It's Just That These Two
Are Too Perfect To Lose.

19:05.839 --> 19:08.262
I Mean, All That Guilt,
I Can Practically Taste It.

19:08.650 --> 19:10.192
What The Hell
Are You Two Doing?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.464
Sorry.
It's A Private Game.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.284
Oh, Is That What This Is?
You Just Play With Them Like They're Toys?

19:15.285 --> 19:17.920
None Of Your Business.
Buh-Bye.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.325
Melinda.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.020
Is He Gonna Be All Right?

19:23.800 --> 19:26.200
Zenorex Prescribed
To Steven Sinclair.

19:26.201 --> 19:26.934
Yeah, This Is
Good News, Actually.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.281
It's An Antidepressant.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.345
He'd Have To Take A Lot
Of These To Be Fatal.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.969
This Guy Just Try
To Kill Himself?

19:33.200 --> 19:34.785
His Daughter Put It
In His Drink.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.700
What?
It Wasn't Really Her, Ok?

19:36.703 --> 19:38.749
There's 2 Ghosts In The House,
And They're Trying To Control Them.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.243
Wait.There Are 2 Ghosts--
What, They're Possessed?

19:41.245 --> 19:43.643
It's Called Oppression.They Lived Here Before.
It's A Long Story.

19:43.644 --> 19:46.000
Wait. You Always Say Houses Aren't Haunted,
People--

19:46.001 --> 19:47.711
Ok, Just--
All Right.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.551
Well, Do We
Call The Cops?

19:50.650 --> 19:52.541
Not Yet. As Long As They're
Out Of The House, They're Safe,

19:52.545 --> 19:53.800
And They Don't Even
Remember What Happened.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.545
I Just Can't Let This Little Girl Get
Taken Away From Her Dad.

19:57.000 --> 19:57.500
All Right.

19:57.503 --> 19:58.965
Ok, Will You Just Keep An Eye
On Him For Me?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.355
I'll Do What I Can,

20:00.600 --> 20:02.450
But I Think They're Only Gonna Keep
Steven Overnight.

20:02.453 --> 20:04.518
I Have To Figure Out Who These
Ghosts Are And What They Want.

20:04.519 --> 20:05.453
Right.

20:05.519 --> 20:06.486
Hey.
Yeah?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.220
You Call Me
If Anything Changes?

20:08.287 --> 20:09.167
You Know It.

20:15.220 --> 20:16.400
It Was A Man And A Woman.

20:16.407 --> 20:17.972
The Woman Is
Slightly Older Than Him.

20:17.973 --> 20:19.544
It's Not Marlo's Mother?

20:20.040 --> 20:22.173
No. I Don't Think They're
Connected To The Family At All.

20:22.175 --> 20:23.540
They Might Be Connected
To The House.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.600
But I Thought You Said Places Aren't Haunted,
And People Are.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.460
All Right, Shush.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.300
Hey, Wait A Minute.
You Got Steve And Marlo

20:30.303 --> 20:31.800
Out Of The House.
That's A Positive Thing.

20:32.036 --> 20:34.870
Except For The Fact That Marlo Practically
Killed Her Father.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.583
Less Positive, I Admit.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.489
Look, These Oppressive Ghosts,They're Stubborn.
They're Very Powerful.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.043
Powerful Enough To Survive More
Than One Owner,

20:41.044 --> 20:43.534
Which Is Probably Why The House Is Haunted,
And Not The People.

20:43.644 --> 20:45.910
TouchÉ. All Right.

20:45.917 --> 20:49.746
So You Said That These Ghosts
Are Treating It All Like It's Some Kind Of A Game?

20:49.747 --> 20:51.070
Yeah. Like A Contest.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.320
What Is It,
The Newlydead Game?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.265
That Was Good.
I Just Made That Up.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.170
All Right, What's
The Point Of Their Game,

20:57.177 --> 20:58.776
Last Ghost Out
Of The House Wins?

20:58.777 --> 21:01.300
Last Man Standing.
Steve And Marlo Are The Game Pieces.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.015
Why Don't You Just Figure Out
What Their Names Are,

21:03.200 --> 21:05.374
Figure Out How To Play,
And Beat Them At Their Own Game

21:05.375 --> 21:06.535
And Get Them To Cross Over?

21:06.542 --> 21:08.020
Don't Make It
Sound So Easy.

21:10.930 --> 21:12.570
Maybe I Already
Have A Name.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.831
You Said That Steve Signed
A Tax Form--Sorry.

21:14.832 --> 21:16.260
He Did? Oh, There You Are.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.230
When You Went Down There.
Can I See It?

21:18.370 --> 21:20.139
Uh, Why?
Why--Why Do You Need To?

21:20.140 --> 21:21.313
Please. I Just
Need To See It.

21:23.507 --> 21:25.183
Is It Something
About His Handwriting?

21:27.400 --> 21:30.140
Okget Ready To Think
Of A Rational Reason.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.050
For What?

21:31.370 --> 21:34.597
Why Steve Sinclair Signed His Name
As "Matthew Sembrook."

21:41.370 --> 21:42.464
You Know,
I Don't Get It.

21:42.671 --> 21:45.336
Why Would Steve Sign
Somebody Else's Name?

21:45.337 --> 21:47.400
Because That's
Who He Thinks He Is.

21:47.401 --> 21:48.564
Here. Look.

21:48.565 --> 21:51.755
"Matthew Sembrook With Father Erwin
And Mother Vivian."

21:52.150 --> 21:54.370
Mother?
She Looks 10 Years Older Than Him.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.921
Matt Is Erwin's Son
From A Previous Marriage.

21:56.926 --> 21:58.370
He Was Vivian's Stepson.

21:58.371 --> 22:01.579
It Says Here That Matthew And Vivian Died
Of Natural Gas Poisoning.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.715
What Happened To Erwin Sembrook?
Where's He?

22:04.850 --> 22:06.734
Dead, 6 Months Before.

22:06.735 --> 22:09.511
Apparently, Erwin Died In An Accident Shortly
After Marrying Vivian,

22:09.515 --> 22:12.031
So Mother And Son Inherited
The House And The Fortune.

22:12.255 --> 22:14.910
So You're Saying
That These Two,

22:15.250 --> 22:18.900
Matthew And Vivian, Are
Haunting The Sinclairs?

22:18.903 --> 22:21.010
Not Only Haunting Them,
But Controlling Them,

22:21.011 --> 22:23.300
Which I'm Sure Is What They Did With Everyone Else
Who Lived In That House.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.900
Well, Their Death,
What Happened?

22:26.905 --> 22:29.000
Was It An Accident,
A Suicide?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
What Does
The Article Say?

22:30.206 --> 22:33.120
Well, It Says Here That
There Are Unanswered Questions.

22:33.206 --> 22:35.140
Well, Is There Something
I Can Do To Help?

22:36.040 --> 22:37.427
Would You Really Want To?

22:39.574 --> 22:41.880
Look. You're Right.

22:42.173 --> 22:43.440
I Don't Know Why,

22:43.570 --> 22:47.400
But There Is Just Some Default Switch That
Goes Off Inside My Head,

22:47.406 --> 22:50.566
And It Always Resets
To "That Can't Be."

22:51.210 --> 22:52.363
Well, Maybe It Can Be.

22:54.900 --> 22:55.756
Ok.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.615
Maybe It Can.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.273
I Just Don't Want To Feel Like
I'm Hurting You

23:01.275 --> 23:02.600
Every Time
That I Question It.

23:02.870 --> 23:04.078
It Has Nothing To Do
With Hurting Me.

23:05.930 --> 23:08.296
I Just Hate To See You
So Closed Off.

23:08.910 --> 23:11.929
I Mean, There Are Tons Of Things
In Life That We Take On Faith,

23:11.930 --> 23:15.235
That We Can't See.
Why Can't You Do That With Spirits?

23:16.630 --> 23:17.444
I Can.

23:20.270 --> 23:21.100
I Will.

23:22.671 --> 23:24.355
I'm Gonna Try.

23:26.271 --> 23:27.260
But If I Can't--

23:27.800 --> 23:28.500
I'm Sorry.

23:30.100 --> 23:30.700
Jim.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.600
Mel, Steve's Being Released From
The Hospital Tonight.

23:32.601 --> 23:34.427
He's Signing
Himself Out, Goin' Home.

23:40.454 --> 23:41.377
I Know Who You Are.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.685
Matthew And Vivian Sembrook.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.550
You Like To Play Games?

23:54.597 --> 23:55.460
So Do I.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.317
Let's See How You Do With
Someone You Don't Control.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.840
Not So Easy
Keeping Up The Energy

24:06.843 --> 24:08.370
When The Sinclairs
Are Gone, Is It?

24:08.470 --> 24:09.570
Oh, You'll Do.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.644
You Both Need To Cross Over.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.425
No, Thanks.
We're Good Here.

24:14.616 --> 24:16.976
Ok. Then I'll
Play You For It.

24:19.000 --> 24:19.782
For What?

24:20.034 --> 24:21.535
A Crossover.

24:21.935 --> 24:23.094
20 Questions.

24:23.401 --> 24:25.735
If I Can Tell You What Happened
When You Lived Here,

24:25.740 --> 24:26.830
Then You Have To Cross Over.

24:27.950 --> 24:29.405
And If You Don't Guess?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.260
I'll Never Bother You Again.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.460
Really?
That Is So Stupid.

24:34.750 --> 24:35.967
You Don't Bothers
At All.

24:35.970 --> 24:37.855
You Mean Nothing
To Us.

24:39.900 --> 24:40.707
I Like It.

24:42.750 --> 24:43.570
Let's Do It.

24:45.416 --> 24:47.350
What Were You Doing When I
First Saw You In The Garage?

24:48.150 --> 24:49.840
I Never Saw You
In The Garage.

24:49.845 --> 24:51.396
Are You Sure You Want To
Count That As A Question?

24:51.750 --> 24:53.955
Your Late Huand Died
In This House, Didn't He?

24:54.700 --> 24:55.530
Yes.

24:55.670 --> 24:56.669
And You Were Both Here
That Night?

24:56.670 --> 24:58.120
Yes.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.130
And You Feel Guilty
About What Happened?

25:00.970 --> 25:03.280
Just Like You Feel Guilty About A Few
Things, Don't You?

25:04.300 --> 25:05.970
About Someone In
Particular, Maybe?

25:06.133 --> 25:07.656
I'm Asking The Questions.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.567
That's Right,
Andrea, You Are.

25:10.049 --> 25:10.955
What?

25:12.920 --> 25:14.886
I'm Sorry.
Did I Call You By Someone Else's Name?

25:15.130 --> 25:16.393
Did You Kill Your Husband?

25:18.240 --> 25:19.707
You Want To Know
What Happened That Night?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.407
Come.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.040
Vivian, Mathew,
Are You Up Ther?

25:57.270 --> 25:57.760
??

25:59.270 --> 26:00.645
How Can You Do This?

26:01.230 --> 26:02.164
He's My Son!

26:02.530 --> 26:03.517
He's Not My Son.

26:04.450 --> 26:05.573
He Does Something
You Never Do,

26:05.577 --> 26:06.760
Pays Attention To Me.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.184
Vivian, Wait.

26:09.834 --> 26:13.127
And You! What Kind
Of A Man Are You?

26:13.450 --> 26:15.097
A Man Raised By You.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.765
Don't You Turn
Your Back On Me!

26:27.000 --> 26:28.351
 Look,
It Was An Accident.

26:28.355 --> 26:30.210
Ok, I Just Saw It.
He Missed A Step,

26:30.212 --> 26:31.875
So You Don't Have To
Blame Yourself.

26:32.310 --> 26:33.950
You Guys Can Forgive
Each Other.

26:34.330 --> 26:37.127
And Your Dad, He's Gonna
Be In The Light, Ok?

26:37.130 --> 26:38.129
He'll Forgive You.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.880
Wow. She Did It.

26:41.197 --> 26:42.690
She Wins The Game.

26:45.431 --> 26:47.330
So Now You Can Cross Over

26:47.335 --> 26:48.720
And You Can Leave
The Sinclairs Alone.

26:49.655 --> 26:53.505
Wait. There Was
One More Thing.

27:08.550 --> 27:09.575
Why?

27:10.383 --> 27:11.870
Why?

27:30.549 --> 27:31.473
Stop It!

27:36.216 --> 27:37.316
You Killed Him.

27:37.670 --> 27:40.440
Yeah, Sorry.
It's Just That...

27:42.350 --> 27:44.053
Well, We're Really Not
Very Nice People.

27:53.870 --> 27:56.200
Melinda, What--What Are You
Still Doing Here?

27:56.201 --> 27:58.467
I'll Explain Later,
Ok, But We Have To Get Out Ofere.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.200
Now, You Can Just Come
A-And Stay With Me,

28:00.203 --> 28:02.420
But You Have To Get Out
Of This House Right Now.

28:04.170 --> 28:04.910
Ok, Let's Go.

28:05.336 --> 28:06.000
Ok.

28:09.369 --> 28:11.537
Don't Be
A Sore Loser.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.335
And Leave Us
The Hell Alone.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.470
Steve, Please Don't Do This.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.655
Who Are You?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.175
Are You Liz Sinclair?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.665
Are Matt And Vivian Stopping You
From Going In The House?

29:08.766 --> 29:10.250
I'm Too Weak.

29:11.067 --> 29:12.893
They're
Too Strong For Me.

29:12.980 --> 29:14.503
They're Only Strong
'Cause They've Spent Years

29:14.505 --> 29:16.337
Feeding Off Of
Other People's Fear,

29:16.338 --> 29:18.545
Playing Their Little Games.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.771
Did Steve Cause Your Death?

29:23.151 --> 29:24.157
Yes.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.235
But He Had To.

29:28.234 --> 29:28.900
Why?

29:29.660 --> 29:31.923
The Alternative Would
Have Been Even Worse.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.900
I Think That Steve's Guilt

29:36.000 --> 29:38.935
Is What's Allowing Matt And Vivian To Have
So Much Power Over Them.

29:39.450 --> 29:41.520
It's Not
Just Steve's Guilt.

29:41.682 --> 29:43.255
What?

29:43.517 --> 29:45.500
It's Marlo, Too.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.020
He Will Always Blame You.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.690
Every Time He Looks At You,
He Sees His Dead Wife.

29:58.870 --> 30:00.350
Do You Know
What That Does To Him?

30:08.137 --> 30:09.785
There's Really Only
One Way To End This,

30:10.737 --> 30:13.050
All This Pain,
All This Anger.

30:14.156 --> 30:15.406
You Know What It Is.

30:17.223 --> 30:18.673
You Know What You
Have To Do

30:19.900 --> 30:21.220
For Your Own Protection.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.536
You Know What You
Have To Do

30:37.100 --> 30:39.380
To Make Sure
You Both Get Peace.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.500
It's The Best Thing
For Both Of You.

31:18.505 --> 31:20.310
It Only Hurts For A Second.
You'll Barely Know,

31:20.672 --> 31:22.482
And Then You'll Both Finally
Have Some Peace.

31:22.638 --> 31:24.709
Don't Listen To Her.
Ok, This Is Not You.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.169
This Is A Ghost That's Making You
Feel These Things.

31:27.550 --> 31:28.240
What?

31:28.450 --> 31:29.413
This Is What You Do,
Isn't It?

31:30.217 --> 31:32.200
You Just Play Your Story
Over And Over Again,

31:32.205 --> 31:33.584
Except It's A New Person
Each Te,

31:33.706 --> 31:34.715
But Your Real Story

31:35.420 --> 31:37.365
Is That You Were So Guilty
About Killing Your Husband

31:37.370 --> 31:38.430
That You Killed Yourselves.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.900
Looks And Brains.
I'm Impressed.

31:42.130 --> 31:45.230
The Newspapers Keep Saying
That It's--It's Poisoning From Natural Gas.

31:45.902 --> 31:47.625
It's A Little More Complicated
Than That, Isn't It?

31:48.685 --> 31:49.315
A Bit.

31:52.555 --> 31:53.775
??

32:00.200 --> 32:02.046
And It Wasn't
About Guilt Either.

32:04.970 --> 32:08.833
The Thing Is Matt And I Always Thought We
Were A Perfect Match,

32:08.835 --> 32:11.805
Because Neither One Of Us Had
A Shred Of Conscience.

32:12.102 --> 32:13.393
Oh, It Was
Just Delicious.

32:17.980 --> 32:21.985
The Problem Is That When You Realize The Man You Love
 Is As Dangerous As You Are...

32:32.713 --> 32:34.162
Let's Just Say
It's Not A Trust Builder.

32:35.446 --> 32:37.255
Attraction Turns
To Suspicion.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.610
There Was A Lot
Of Money At Stake.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.900
Erwin Had Left Us Both
Very Well Off.

32:44.483 --> 32:45.799
So I Started To Wonder

32:46.430 --> 32:48.025
Was Matthew's
Devotion Real,

32:48.910 --> 32:50.907
Or Did He Really Want All That Money
To Himself,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.495
And What Would He
Be Willing To Do?

32:54.100 --> 32:55.745
He Already Knew What
I Was Willing To Do,

32:59.347 --> 33:01.310
And I'm Sure He Was Having The Same
Thoughts About Me.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.706
Which Is Why I Decided

33:04.710 --> 33:06.400
That The Best Thing
For Our Relationship

33:06.407 --> 33:10.395
Was For Matt To Have A Tragic,
Careless Accident.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.473
Control Freak That I Am,
I Wanted To Make Sure That He Fell Asleep,

33:16.767 --> 33:18.215
As It Were,
Before I Left The House.

33:18.533 --> 33:20.140
He Was Always
So Restless.

33:20.334 --> 33:24.735
Imagine My Surprise
When I Fell Asleep Before He Did.

33:25.967 --> 33:28.217
Very Sneaky Stuff,
Natural Gas.

33:28.734 --> 33:31.607
Turns Out I Was Much More Sensitive
To It Than He Was.

33:32.334 --> 33:34.330
Of Course, Matt Followed
Soon After.

33:45.850 --> 33:48.020
Then We Woke Up,
And We Were Dead,

33:49.450 --> 33:51.664
And We've Been Here Having A Blast
Ever Since.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.355
What? What Is Going On?

34:03.880 --> 34:05.360
I'm Gonna Get You Out Of This House
Right Now.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.440
We'll Get Your Father.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.456
I Vote For My Guy.
He's Gonna Go All The Way.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.800
You Should Have Behaved.

34:16.100 --> 34:16.840
What Are You
Going To Do?

34:17.150 --> 34:18.434
Don't Count
My Girl Out.

34:18.438 --> 34:19.710
Both Of You
Just Stop It.

34:20.904 --> 34:22.454
This Is Family Business.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.195
You Should Have
Left Us Alone.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.000
Too Late Now.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.400
Steve, Please Stop, Ok?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.370
I've Seen Your Wife.
I've Seen Her Spirit.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.739
My Wife Is Dead.

34:38.934 --> 34:39.815
You Should Know.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.407
You Killed Her.
Me?

34:43.033 --> 34:45.029
If It Wasn't For You,
She'd Still Be Alive.

34:45.030 --> 34:46.219
You Let Go!

34:46.463 --> 34:47.560
You Didn't Listen To Me!

34:47.659 --> 34:49.396
Now That's
Entertainment.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.050
Come On. Come On.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.020
What's Happening?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.930
Just Trust Me.
I'm Taking You To Your Mother.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.094
Wait, Waitwait!

35:06.330 --> 35:08.256
What Are You--What Are
You Saying About My Mom?

35:09.100 --> 35:11.472
Tell Her I'm Sorry
That It's Been So Hard On Them.

35:12.533 --> 35:14.220
Your Mom Is Here With Us.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.167
I Can See Her.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.200
Tell Her I Miss
Our Nightly Ritual

35:21.201 --> 35:22.541
Of Brushing
Each Other's Hair,

35:23.720 --> 35:26.115
Her Beautiful Hair That She Got From
Her Grandmother.

35:26.319 --> 35:28.330
She Misses Brushing
Each Other's Hair.

35:32.986 --> 35:37.120
Dad, Uh,
She Says Mom's Here,

35:37.320 --> 35:40.053
Her--Her Spirit
Or--Or Ghost Or Something,

35:40.055 --> 35:41.388
And She Wants To Help.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.485
What--What Are You
Talking About?

35:43.930 --> 35:45.588
That Shirt He's Wearing
Is My Favorite,

35:45.593 --> 35:47.623
Because He Wore It
When Marlo Was Born.

35:47.860 --> 35:49.034
She Remembers Your Shirt.

35:50.630 --> 35:52.980
You Were Wearing It
The Day That Marlo Was Born.

35:55.063 --> 35:56.296
She Said That?

36:00.705 --> 36:01.450
She's Really Here?

36:04.739 --> 36:06.430
They Have To Stop Punishing
Themselves.

36:07.650 --> 36:09.629
She Wants You To Stop
Punishing Each Other.

36:16.016 --> 36:17.455
I'm So Sorry, Mom.

36:18.083 --> 36:22.016
Dad's Right. If It Wasn't For Me, I--
No.

36:22.083 --> 36:23.584
It's All My Fault, And--

36:23.585 --> 36:24.460
No. It Was Me.

36:26.686 --> 36:27.699
It Was Me.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.880
I Made The Decision.
It Was Me.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.545
What Happened That Day?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.286
We Were So Tired.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.844
We'd Been On
That Trail All Day.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.250
Watch
My Moves.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.393
Oh. Hey, Look!

36:52.200 --> 36:53.630
It Happened So Fast.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.367
Aah!
Liz!

36:58.234 --> 36:59.380
No!

37:04.870 --> 37:06.420
One Second,
She Was Next To Me.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.046
The Next, She Was
Hanging Off A Cliff.

37:12.270 --> 37:14.488
I Was Trying To Pull Her Up, But I Couldn't
Get Any Traction.

37:18.560 --> 37:19.800
Mom!
No!

37:21.260 --> 37:22.525
Dad!
Stay There!

37:23.770 --> 37:25.600
And That's When
It All Fell Apart.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.265
I Knew I Couldn't
Stop Marlo.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.950
How Can You Stop A Child From Trying
To Save Her Mother?

37:42.050 --> 37:44.000
Mom! Aah!

37:44.150 --> 37:45.460
Marlo Was Falling.

37:46.217 --> 37:47.545
She Was Gonna Die.

37:48.051 --> 37:50.654
I Couldn't Get Liz
Back On The Ledge.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.625
I Thought There Was Only
One Way To Save Her.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.974
I Let Go Of Liz,

38:13.100 --> 38:14.648
And I Grabbed Ahold
Of Marlo.

38:17.150 --> 38:18.636
Mom!
Liz!

38:22.549 --> 38:23.920
I'm So Sorry.

38:25.150 --> 38:26.900
I Should Have Tried
To Save You Both.

38:28.450 --> 38:30.900
No.
No, He Couldn't.

38:30.904 --> 38:32.200
He Did What
I Wanted Him To Do,

38:32.204 --> 38:33.600
The Only Thing
That He Could Do.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.000
You Did Everything
That She Wanted You To Do.

38:37.005 --> 38:37.875
You Saved Marlo.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.550
And I Know You Were
Trying To Save Me.

38:50.733 --> 38:52.495
She Risked
Her Life For Me.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.566
She Doesn't Blame You.

38:58.150 --> 38:59.395
She Was Really
Proud Of You.

39:02.450 --> 39:04.365
I'm So Sorry, Mom.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.665
I Don't Know How To Do
Any Of This Without You.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.460
You Will Always Have Me With You
In Your Heart,

39:13.870 --> 39:15.915
But Most Importantly,
You Have Each Other.

39:18.220 --> 39:20.445
They've Gotta Stop
Punishing Themselves.

39:20.550 --> 39:23.335
Please Tell Them That We'll Always
Be A Family,

39:24.650 --> 39:26.505
And They Have To
Take Care Of Each Other.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.415
I Will.

39:37.850 --> 39:39.098
I Have To Go Now.

39:49.140 --> 39:50.285
She Crossed Over.

39:53.473 --> 39:54.470
Is She Gonna Be Ok?

39:55.240 --> 39:58.785
She Was Smiling, At Peace.

40:02.350 --> 40:03.880
She's Always
Gonna Be In Your Heart.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.475
How Come I Don't Feel Anything Bad
When I Go Inside Now?

40:18.100 --> 40:20.955
They Can't Feed Off Your Guilt Anymore.
They're Weak.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.885
How Can I Sell This House To Somebody
Knowing What I Know?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.917
I'll Come Back,
Cross Them Over.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.000
Don't Worry About It.
You Two Just Get A Fresh Start.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.840
I Cannot
Thank You Enough.

40:33.450 --> 40:34.155
Me, Too.

40:38.050 --> 40:39.200
Things'll Get Better Now.
You'll See.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.900
Would You Mind Checking Marlo
Into The Hotel?

40:42.905 --> 40:44.300
I Just Need To Grab
A Few More Things.

40:44.305 --> 40:45.200
Sure. Come On.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.065
Only One Way To Be Sure
Things'll Get Better.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.645
Well Played.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.305
My Dad!

41:43.360 --> 41:44.389
Fresh Start.

42:09.700 --> 42:10.300
Hi, Mel.

42:10.304 --> 42:13.485
Jim, You'd Better Get The Fire Department
To The Sinclair House.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.655
Steve Did The Only Thing
He Thought He Could Do.

42:16.004 --> 42:17.220
What Will We Do?

42:19.500 --> 42:20.780
What If
Nobody Else Comes?

42:21.366 --> 42:23.800
This Is Our Home,The--The Place Where We Met.

42:23.805 --> 42:24.400
We Can't Leave.

42:24.402 --> 42:25.995
Don't Worry.
Somebody Always Comes.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.725
They'll Build.
They'll Buy And Sell.

42:28.870 --> 42:30.219
All We Have To Do Is Wait.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.280
What Do We Do
In The Meantime?

42:34.600 --> 42:35.474
How 'Bout A Game?

42:37.720 --> 42:38.500
20 Questions?

42:38.505 --> 42:39.220
You're On.

42:40.450 --> 42:42.500
Ok. Oh,
I Got A Good One.

42:42.505 --> 42:44.000
