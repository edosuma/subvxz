I like the sound of that.

00:27.337 --> 00:29.420
<i>And a hot new city.</i>

00:29.422 --> 00:30.988
So it's really gonna happen?

00:30.990 --> 00:33.491
My purse in "Interview" magazine?

01:43.697 --> 01:46.364
Did your father say why he
won't let you date Sebastian?

01:46.366 --> 01:48.116
No, he's probably just
being overprotective.

Nobody's good enough

Go out with a real loser.

you're dating Sebastian.

My dad's a cop. I can probably

I know all about
the "perfect daughter" thing.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.261

02:00.263 --> 02:02.764
You live your whole life in fear

It's one thing I don't have
to worry about.

02:04.217 --> 02:05.350
My parents will never use

02:06.603 --> 02:07.803
You don't have to worry either.

They don't even know Seth exists.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.192
As far as they're concerned,

02:14.194 --> 02:15.393
I can't consider having a boyfriend

02:15.395 --> 02:16.694
until I've graduated summa cum laude

02:16.696 --> 02:18.429

02:24.537 --> 02:26.204
You were a great girlfriend.

02:26.206 --> 02:30.408
I mean, breakups
can be weird for all of us.

02:30.410 --> 02:33.745
Are you gonna be bummed if
we wanna hang out with Walt?

02:33.747 --> 02:35.496
Why would I be bummed?

02:36.548 --> 02:37.865
Well, aren't you gonna
make us pick sides

02:37.867 --> 02:39.467
and forbid us from speaking to Walt?

02:39.469 --> 02:42.136
Are you waiting for me to be
the crazy ex-girlfriend?

02:42.138 --> 02:45.890
Well, I mean, you have been
known to react... emotionally.

02:45.892 --> 02:48.459
Just say it.
You're a drama queen.

02:48.461 --> 02:51.229
You think I'm a drama queen?

02:51.231 --> 02:52.980
That's absurd. When have I ever
acted like a drama queen?

02:52.982 --> 02:54.065
Name one time.

02:54.067 --> 02:56.901
Um... now.

02:56.903 --> 02:58.770
Little bit.

02:59.773 --> 03:00.938
Come on.
Okay, but really, though,

03:00.940 --> 03:02.323
what should I do about Sebastian?

03:02.325 --> 03:05.359
How should I know?
I'm just a drama queen.

03:07.696 --> 03:09.781
<i>Luckily, I had someone
with a lot more experience</i>

03:09.783 --> 03:10.782
<i>I could talk to.</i>

03:10.784 --> 03:12.667
Ugh. I once had
a <i>lurid</i> affair

03:12.669 --> 03:14.368
with my father's best friend,

03:14.370 --> 03:16.504
which became divinely hazardous

03:16.506 --> 03:18.489
when I started seeing
his son on the side.

03:18.491 --> 03:20.291
<i>Perhaps too much experience.</i>

03:20.293 --> 03:22.043
Are you blushing?

03:22.045 --> 03:23.094
You are.

03:23.096 --> 03:27.965
Your life is just so...
Exotic.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.718
You mean dirty.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.003
No apologies. To me,
the most exciting men

03:33.005 --> 03:34.772
are the ones that we can't have.

03:34.774 --> 03:38.025
Forbidden fruit.
So delish.

03:38.027 --> 03:40.111
But we were talking
about <i>your</i> love life.

03:40.113 --> 03:41.646
Tell me about your roue.

03:41.648 --> 03:43.314
I'm not exactly sure what that means.

03:43.316 --> 03:44.816
It's French for "bad boy""

03:44.818 --> 03:47.017
oh, man, that sounds
so much sexier in French.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.619
Mm-hmm, whoever came up
with that language

03:48.621 --> 03:50.071
knew what they were doing.

03:50.073 --> 03:52.623
Well, if he is a... roue,

03:52.625 --> 03:55.076
should I still go out with him?

03:55.078 --> 03:56.744
Are you seriously asking me
if it's all right

03:56.746 --> 03:59.747
to get involved with a bad boy?

03:59.749 --> 04:00.882
Male species 101, cupcake...

04:00.884 --> 04:03.534
Men are no good if they're not bad.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.470
Honestly, Carrie,
it's like you've never had sex.

04:05.472 --> 04:08.973
Well, compared to you,
it feels like I haven't.

04:08.975 --> 04:10.508
Well, you let me know
if this bad boy of yours

04:10.510 --> 04:11.926
doesn't work out.

04:11.928 --> 04:13.394
I've got 40 more I can introduce you to

04:13.396 --> 04:15.096

04:45.011 --> 04:47.345
Protection from what?

04:47.347 --> 04:49.180
Didn't your wife give you
specific instructions?

04:49.182 --> 04:52.416
Um... no. I'm...
I don't have a wife.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.969
She... I'm a widower.

04:54.971 --> 04:56.971
And so these are for my daughter.

04:56.973 --> 04:58.523
Oh, this must be so challenging.

04:58.525 --> 05:01.142
It is. I had no idea it was
so hard to buy tampons.

05:01.144 --> 05:03.895
No, I mean, the single dad
raising a family, and...

05:03.897 --> 05:06.614
Oh, right.
Well...

05:06.616 --> 05:08.950
I'm managing... most days.

05:08.952 --> 05:10.718
I never envisioned I'd be
spending my lunch hour

05:10.720 --> 05:12.370
buying feminine protection.

05:12.372 --> 05:14.872
I'm sure. Poor thing.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.459
I'm Celia, by the way.
Tom.

05:18.461 --> 05:20.795
You know, let me give you my number...

05:20.797 --> 05:23.164
In case you ever have any questions

05:23.166 --> 05:26.951
I might be able to answer.
I can be very helpful.

05:26.953 --> 05:31.455
Your daughter...
Probably uses the regular.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.290
Good to know.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.309

<i>There he was... my bad boy.</i>

06:03.790 --> 06:05.506
Yeah?

06:05.508 --> 06:06.624
Of course, yeah.

06:06.626 --> 06:08.926
I've been sitting here,
waiting for you.

06:08.928 --> 06:10.177
Why?

06:10.179 --> 06:12.630
Because I don't know what
we're doing tomorrow.

06:12.632 --> 06:14.548
I didn't know we were doing anything.

06:14.550 --> 06:17.718
Well, now you do.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.857
Well, I guess we could, um,
get something to eat?

06:22.859 --> 06:24.475
That's not very original, though.

06:24.477 --> 06:27.612
No, it's a great idea.
I'm always hungry.

06:27.614 --> 06:30.481

No.

It's just my dad can be, uh...
Well, you met him.

06:35.571 --> 06:37.955
Ah, the two seconds at the pool.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.624
Our dads know each other, right?

06:39.626 --> 06:42.660
It's possible.
My dad knows a lot of people.

06:44.079 --> 06:45.529
Hmm.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.048
What are you listening to?

06:47.050 --> 06:50.501
The new album by the cars.
Have you heard it?

06:50.503 --> 06:52.970
Oh, you gotta.
It's amazing.

07:02.681 --> 07:04.148
This is fantastic.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.232
I know.

07:05.234 --> 07:08.903
Here. So we can
listen together.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.663
<i>We had a connection, literally.</i>

07:18.665 --> 07:22.667
<i>And I knew in my heart there
was nothing bad about this boy.</i>

07:22.669 --> 07:26.403
<i>Now I just had to convince
my father of that.</i>

07:27.906 --> 07:30.508
Oh. Here.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.043
This was...

07:32.045 --> 07:33.627
On the sh-shopping list.

07:33.629 --> 07:35.963
Oh. Thanks.

07:35.965 --> 07:37.181
I can buy these next time.

07:37.183 --> 07:40.134
There's gonna be a next time?

07:40.136 --> 07:41.635
It's definitely

07:41.637 --> 07:44.772
an adventure being the father
to two teenage girls.

07:44.774 --> 07:45.974
Well, you're doing a great job.

07:45.975 --> 07:49.110
I should tell you that
more often, or once.

07:49.112 --> 07:52.296
Aw. It means a lot
to hear you say that.

07:52.298 --> 07:53.731
Thanks, kiddo.

07:53.733 --> 07:57.318
I mean, so great, there's
hardly anything I would change.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.319
Hardly anything?

07:58.321 --> 07:59.870
Maybe, like, one thing.

07:59.872 --> 08:01.572
Oh, please. Enlighten me.

08:01.574 --> 08:05.292
That thing about you not
letting me see Sebastian.

08:05.294 --> 08:06.827
That's not gonna change.

08:06.829 --> 08:08.212
Dad, you gotta stop thinking
I'm your perfect daughter,

08:08.214 --> 08:09.980
and nobody's ever gonna be
good enough for me.

08:09.982 --> 08:12.783
- Oh, I don't think that.
- Oh, well, now I'm just insulted.

08:12.785 --> 08:16.554
This isn't about <i>you.</i>
This is about the Kydd... kid.

08:16.556 --> 08:18.806
You don't even know him.
Neither do you.

08:18.808 --> 08:20.925
At least give me a reason.
Not now.

08:20.927 --> 08:22.426
"Not now" means "neve"" with you.

08:22.428 --> 08:25.513
Actually, it doesn't...
Except in this case.

08:25.515 --> 08:27.809
- I just wanna understand.
- There's nothing to understand.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.101
I've said all that I can say.

08:29.102 --> 08:32.403
You haven't <i>said</i> anything.
Because I can't. Now drop it.

08:32.405 --> 08:36.607
You can't? You make it sound
like he's one of your clients.

08:36.609 --> 08:39.243
Is he one of your clients?

08:39.245 --> 08:41.861
Hello! Are we ever
having dinner?

08:41.864 --> 08:44.365
Dorrit, dad and I are
in the middle of something.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.200
No, we're not.
We are done here.

08:46.202 --> 08:48.202
Dad, come on.
This is fascinating.

08:48.204 --> 08:50.154
Meanwhile,
starving children in Ethiopia

08:50.156 --> 08:51.622
- are eating better than I do.
- Come here. Look.

08:51.624 --> 08:53.257
Got everything you wanted...

08:53.259 --> 08:56.210
Stouffer's...
French bread...

08:56.212 --> 08:57.995
Pizza.

08:57.997 --> 08:59.713
This is a joke, right?

08:59.715 --> 09:01.232
Isn't this what you wanted?

09:01.234 --> 09:02.349
It's <i>one</i> thing...

09:02.351 --> 09:03.851
Stouffer's French bread pizza.

09:03.853 --> 09:07.104
Did you never notice mom kept
a gazillion boxes in the freezer

09:07.106 --> 09:09.506
because it's my favorite?
Dorrit, I'm sorry.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.842
I'll take care of myself since
apparently nobody else will.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.111
Dorrit, get back here.

09:14.113 --> 09:16.349
Be home by 9:00!

09:16.350 --> 09:17.414
Where are you going?

09:17.416 --> 09:19.516
Audrey's.

09:21.571 --> 09:23.020
Do we really think
that's where she's going?

09:23.022 --> 09:25.289
With Dorrit, who knows?

09:36.468 --> 09:38.135
Hey.

09:38.137 --> 09:40.204
<i>That night, Dorrit peered into the eyes</i>

09:40.206 --> 09:42.640
of a soulful-looking hamster...

09:50.732 --> 09:55.186
<i>While I peered into
my dad's confidential files.</i>

10:04.446 --> 10:06.247
<i>And there it was,</i>

10:06.249 --> 10:08.532
<i>the worst label Sebastian</i> could <i>have...</i>

10:08.534 --> 10:11.085
<i>One on a folder
in my dad's legal files,</i>

10:11.087 --> 10:13.420
<i>which meant it was
private legal information</i>

10:13.422 --> 10:17.007
<i>that I was supposed to never look at.</i>

10:19.211 --> 10:22.263
I held out as long as I could.

10:34.924 --> 10:36.442
And it said in the file
he had intimate relations.

10:36.444 --> 10:38.060
What does that mean, exactly...
"Intimate relations"?

10:38.062 --> 10:41.313
It means that Sebastian got
kicked out of his last school

10:41.315 --> 10:44.533
for having sex
with his art history teacher.

10:44.535 --> 10:47.119
Okay, gross.
You can never date him.

10:47.121 --> 10:49.771
But it's sort of cool
he took art history, right?

10:49.773 --> 10:51.607
That probably wasn't
the only thing she taught him.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.127
I repeat... okay, gross.
You can <i>never</i> date him.

10:55.129 --> 10:57.246
Well, it's not necessarily a bad thing

10:57.248 --> 10:59.114
to be with someone who knows
how to do stuff.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.883
I'm just saying...

11:00.885 --> 11:03.052
I don't think he's boyfriend material.

11:03.054 --> 11:05.504
Well, it's not up to you.
Or <i>you.</i>

11:05.506 --> 11:08.424
Well, don't look at me.
I have no idea what to do.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.292
We don't even know
what really happened.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.394
Ooh. It could have been
the teacher that seduced <i>him.</i>

11:12.396 --> 11:15.064
Either way, I am not
enjoying the mental picture.

11:15.066 --> 11:16.965
He made a mistake. It happens.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.434
Your own boyfriend...
He wandered off the reservation.

11:18.436 --> 11:20.135
Now you're taking him back.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.637
I'm not taking him back.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.572
Aren't you guys planning
to meet up in New York?

11:23.574 --> 11:27.159
Yes, but I'm not going to make
the same mistake I made before.

11:27.161 --> 11:28.944
I obviously scared him off last time,

11:28.946 --> 11:32.247
so no pressure this time.
This is me, nonchalant.

11:32.249 --> 11:34.917
Yet you're both taking
a train ride to see each other.

11:34.919 --> 11:37.503
I'm telling myself
that doesn't mean anything.

11:37.505 --> 11:38.654
I'm pretty convincing.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.839
<i>So...</i> This isn't a date.

11:40.841 --> 11:42.591
Neither one of us has used that word.

11:42.593 --> 11:43.876
So what are you gonna do?

11:43.878 --> 11:46.295
Something casual but cool,

11:46.297 --> 11:48.263
like go for ice cream at serendipity.

11:48.265 --> 11:49.831
Oh, that's so cute.
That's so lame.

11:49.833 --> 11:52.134
And by "cute" and "lame,"
you mean "casual but cool"?

11:52.136 --> 11:53.469
- Not at all.
- No

11:53.471 --> 11:54.937
even if you're not

11:54.939 --> 11:57.973
saying it's a date, you could
still dress like it's a date.

11:57.975 --> 11:59.942
You know, maybe wear something cute,

11:59.944 --> 12:01.510
even a little sexy.
And whatever you say next,

12:01.512 --> 12:04.813
it should not involve
the word "cardigan."

12:04.815 --> 12:06.682
Remember, ladies,

12:06.684 --> 12:07.983
you need to be cool
when it comes to your men.

12:07.985 --> 12:09.735
Seth's not <i>my</i> anything.

12:09.737 --> 12:11.153
I don't even know what Sebastian is

12:11.155 --> 12:13.238
except for maybe too cool for school.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.407
Mm! But not too cool
for a schoolteacher.

12:15.409 --> 12:18.494
Not helping.

12:21.715 --> 12:24.032
Sorry my room is so messy.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.968
It's all this stuff from Walt.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.921
I know. Probably the easiest
cleanup ever.

12:28.923 --> 12:30.556
You might wanna take
your time with this.

12:30.558 --> 12:32.891
Maybe there's something you wanna keep.

12:32.893 --> 12:34.143
It is two years of your life.

12:34.145 --> 12:35.928
What, should I sit around here
and get all weepy

12:35.930 --> 12:38.347
over some old valentines?

12:39.599 --> 12:40.816
That's something
a drama queen would do,

12:40.818 --> 12:44.103
which, as I've already said, I am not.

12:44.105 --> 12:47.322
I'm gonna need a bigger garbage bag.

12:47.324 --> 12:49.575
Can we decide which dress
you're gonna lend me?

12:49.577 --> 12:51.893
Yes, we can.

12:51.895 --> 12:52.911
Try this one.

12:52.913 --> 12:55.030
Super slutty in a good way.

12:55.032 --> 12:58.333
Prince-ton charming
will be sick he ever let you go.

12:58.335 --> 12:59.451
I don't wanna look like
I'm trying too hard.

12:59.453 --> 13:01.503
You need to try a little.

13:01.505 --> 13:03.589
He's already seen the math nerd.

13:03.591 --> 13:04.906
Now it's time to show him...

13:04.908 --> 13:06.742
The sex kitten.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.594
I'm not a kitten.

13:08.596 --> 13:09.962
I'm just a mouse.

13:09.964 --> 13:13.298
Don't worry.
We can make this work.

13:13.300 --> 13:18.637
Just have to pull this up
and then pin...

13:18.639 --> 13:20.756
Uh, you know, this would be
so much easier

13:20.758 --> 13:23.058
if you had even
a little bit of cleavage.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.894
Maybe Carrie will have
something that fits better.

13:25.896 --> 13:27.763
Good idea.
You're both shrimp-toids.

13:31.535 --> 13:32.651
Hello?

13:32.653 --> 13:34.286
Crisis. My clothes
don't fit mouse.

13:34.288 --> 13:36.488
Could it be because
you're 5 inches taller?

13:36.490 --> 13:38.657
I keep forgetting
how long-legged I am.

13:38.659 --> 13:41.243
No, you don't. She could wear
the shiny blue dress

13:41.245 --> 13:42.377
with the low back.

13:42.379 --> 13:44.129
Shiny blue dress with the low back?

13:44.131 --> 13:45.831
Oh, I love that dress.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.783
You should wear that tonight.
Aren't you seeing Sebastian?

13:47.785 --> 13:51.336
Oh, I don't know.
It's too early for slinky.

13:51.338 --> 13:53.472
It is never too early for slinky.

13:53.474 --> 13:57.259
Oh, I can't find it.
My sister must have it.

14:01.731 --> 14:05.400
Oh, good news is I found
the shoes that go with it.

14:05.402 --> 14:07.019
Aah!

14:07.021 --> 14:08.687
- What is it?
- What happened?

14:08.689 --> 14:09.855
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

14:09.857 --> 14:12.941
I can't talk.
I have to kill my sister.

14:12.943 --> 14:14.076
Okay, call back after.

14:15.830 --> 14:18.247
I really like that dress.

14:18.249 --> 14:19.364
Mm-hmm.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.149
<i>Dorrit,</i> what is this?

14:21.151 --> 14:23.919
That's Morrissey, like
the lead singer in the smiths.

14:23.921 --> 14:25.087
Where did it come from?

14:25.089 --> 14:27.089
I'm guessing a female hamster.

14:27.091 --> 14:28.724
Does dad know about this?

14:28.726 --> 14:30.259
No, but I'm sure you'll tell him.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.511
You can't just get
a hamster without asking dad.

14:32.513 --> 14:35.047
I did ask. He said, "not now,"
which means never.

14:35.049 --> 14:36.882
And he doesn't think we know that.

14:38.167 --> 14:41.386
But mom said she'd get me one.

14:41.388 --> 14:42.938
She just...
Didn't get around to it.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.057
Okay. I get it.

14:45.059 --> 14:48.060
But... now you have
to take care of it.

14:48.062 --> 14:50.229
You can't just stick it in a shoebox.

14:50.231 --> 14:52.564
It should have food and water, a wheel.

14:52.566 --> 14:54.483
I mean, at the very least, a cage.

14:54.485 --> 14:55.567
I wanted to get a cage,

14:55.569 --> 14:57.569
but I thought if I did, I'd get caught.

14:57.571 --> 15:02.024
Wait. No, please tell me
you did not shoplift a hamster.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.692
Points for creativity?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.043
It's not funny, Dorrit.

15:05.045 --> 15:07.079
Do you understand that
this is a living creature

15:07.081 --> 15:09.331
whose entire existence
now depends on you?

15:09.333 --> 15:10.549
Yes.

15:10.551 --> 15:12.251
No, you don't,
because you're utterly devoid

15:12.253 --> 15:13.719
of any sense of responsibility.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.637
I mean, you didn't even
pay for this animal.

15:15.639 --> 15:17.589
He was $2. That's a lot.

15:17.591 --> 15:19.875
Tell you what.
If you take him back

15:19.877 --> 15:21.877
to the store right now,

15:21.879 --> 15:23.211
I won't say anything to dad.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.480
I'm not taking him back.

15:25.482 --> 15:27.816
I can't deal with this now.

15:27.818 --> 15:29.301
I have to go somewhere.
Where?

15:29.303 --> 15:31.720
None of your business.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.222
Maybe it's dad's business...

15:34.224 --> 15:37.192
If you're meeting that guy.

15:37.194 --> 15:41.246
So... looks like I get
to keep Morrissey after all.

15:43.032 --> 15:45.918
And while it looked like Dorrit
<i>would keep her hamster,</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:48.420
I kept my date with Sebastian,

15:48.422 --> 15:51.957
and nothing or nobody was gonna
<i>keep me from him.</i>

15:51.959 --> 15:53.742
I'm sorry we're not at dinner.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.177
That's okay.

15:55.179 --> 15:56.428
I brought food, though.

15:56.430 --> 16:00.549
I'm not hungry.

16:01.768 --> 16:04.770
I have something else for you.

16:07.056 --> 16:08.557
I got you your own set.

16:08.559 --> 16:11.443
Now we can listen together,

already doing it,

Monica Penny

Legendary porn star.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.033
Oh, she's done with porn.

19:13.035 --> 19:16.270
Monica Penny has completely
renounced her former existence

19:16.272 --> 19:19.707
and reinvented herself
as a performance artist.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.710
Oh. Okay. That's great.
Is she performing tonight?

19:28.668 --> 19:32.720
you drop a penny in that jar,

19:32.722 --> 19:34.388
and she opens her vagina to you.

You can the...

19:39.628 --> 19:41.145
And that's not porn?

19:41.147 --> 19:45.266
No. She's not selling
her vagina. She's owning it.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.318
You see how that's a huge difference?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.653
Every show is different.

I heard at last night's performance,

19:51.324 --> 19:55.242
her vagina had sex

Do you remember when Walt
won you at the spring carnival?

20:44.242 --> 20:47.661
You were there the first time
we kissed.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.498
I was so happy that day.

20:52.708 --> 20:55.302
I'm sorry it has to end like this.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.972
Uhh!

21:00.375 --> 21:03.877
<i>As Maggie let her drama queen in,</i>

21:03.879 --> 21:07.398
<i>my dad decided to go out
with an old friend.</i>

21:07.400 --> 21:09.767
Tommy, Tommy, say no more.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.485
I get it. You're stuck
in the suburbs with your kids.

21:11.487 --> 21:12.820
That is <i>not</i> what I'm saying.

21:12.822 --> 21:15.072
I.E., your engine
has been on idle.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.491
Well, I'm here to help you
get it back up to mach speed.

21:17.493 --> 21:20.494
Just once, I wish you were
talking about an actual car.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.113
Oh, come on. You missed me.
Admit it.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.865
Yes, Harlan, I did indeed miss you.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.450
I admit it, and I gotta tell you,

21:26.452 --> 21:29.036
I really appreciate you giving
my daughter that internship.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.537
My pleasure.
When does she start?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.005
Two months ago.

21:32.007 --> 21:33.407
Having the time of her life.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.876
Well, I'm about to show you
the time of <i>your</i> life.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.211
What do you mean?
Where are you taking me?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.763
A singles bar.
A wonderful thing they invented

21:39.765 --> 21:42.299
while we were at home being married.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.252
Just think of it as an apple tree,

21:45.254 --> 21:48.422
where every woman there
is ripe for the picking.

21:48.424 --> 21:51.642
<i>While my father
was pushed into the fire,</i>

21:51.644 --> 21:55.229
<i>we were pulled deeper into the furnace.</i>

21:59.702 --> 22:02.035
Look at him.
He can't take his eyes off her.

22:02.037 --> 22:03.871
Well, he's not the only one.

22:03.873 --> 22:06.073
Come on. It's your turn.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.875
- I'm first?
- Mm-hmm.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.299
Here I go.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.284
Okay, I have my penny.

22:17.286 --> 22:20.554
There's the jar.

22:23.624 --> 22:25.292
I can't do it!

22:26.127 --> 22:28.011
I don't wanna see her vagina!

22:28.013 --> 22:29.980
But I'm sure it's very nice.

22:32.134 --> 22:33.650
- Mouse.
- Mouse.

22:33.652 --> 22:34.768
Oh, no, no,

22:34.770 --> 22:36.820
Carrie, you <i>cannot</i> miss this.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.655
This is historic.
One day you will boast

22:38.657 --> 22:41.942
that you were there to see
Monica Penny reclaim her vagina.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.577
<i>Turns out, "in for a Monica Penny,</i>

22:43.579 --> 22:45.646
- <i>in for a pound"...</i>
- Okay.

22:45.647 --> 22:48.648
<i>Is extremely true.</i>

22:48.650 --> 22:52.167
<i>Because that's what
my heart was doing... pounding.</i>

22:57.747 --> 23:00.082
<i>They say that eskimos have
a hundred words for "snow,"</i>

23:00.084 --> 23:02.250
<i>but that's nothing compared
to the number</i>

23:02.252 --> 23:04.504
<i>we have for "vagina."</i>

23:05.872 --> 23:09.725
"Rosebud," "the box, "hoo-ha,"
<i>"pink panther."</i>

23:09.727 --> 23:12.010
<i>Yet I was still petrified
of what I would feel</i>

23:12.012 --> 23:14.479
<i>when Monica Penny uncrossed her legs.</i>

23:20.137 --> 23:23.321
<i>So that was it.</i>

23:23.323 --> 23:24.823
<i>It looked exactly like the drawing</i>

23:24.825 --> 23:27.576
<i>in my biology textbook.</i>

23:27.578 --> 23:31.396
<i>But I had looked my fear in the face...</i>

23:31.398 --> 23:34.570
<i>Or in this case, the vagina.</i>

23:36.107 --> 23:38.808
You there.
What's your name?

23:38.810 --> 23:41.944
Uh... Carrie.

23:41.946 --> 23:42.995
Carrie Bradshaw.

23:42.997 --> 23:45.998
Come here.
I wanna ask you a question.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.450
Okay.

23:47.452 --> 23:50.152
Carrie Bradshaw.

23:50.154 --> 23:52.038
Oh. Microphone
and everything.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.456
Carrie Bradshaw, when I look at you,

23:53.458 --> 23:57.460
I see myself years ago
when my power was pure

23:57.462 --> 23:58.827
and young.

23:58.829 --> 24:00.129
Thank you.

24:00.131 --> 24:01.297
Oh.

24:01.299 --> 24:02.515
Thank you.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.133
But I was foolish.

24:04.135 --> 24:05.184
I sold my power.

24:05.186 --> 24:07.787
I relinquished my vagina.

24:07.789 --> 24:10.556
Learn from my mistakes,
Carrie Bradshaw.

24:10.558 --> 24:13.509
Never let a man...
<i>Any</i> man...

24:13.511 --> 24:15.728
Make your decisions.

24:15.730 --> 24:17.313
I won't.

24:17.315 --> 24:18.948
Own your power.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.450
I will!
Take my throne.

24:21.452 --> 24:22.568
What?

24:22.570 --> 24:23.653
Show us your power.
You're ready.

24:23.655 --> 24:26.656
Show the world your vagina.

24:26.658 --> 24:29.659
<i>I was not the only Bradshaw
in a terrifying situation.</i>

24:29.661 --> 24:32.662
Anyway, so, yeah, my 16-year-old
daughter needed tampons,

24:32.664 --> 24:34.964
and guess who had
to go get 'em? Me.

24:34.966 --> 24:36.916
Which, uh, you probably
do all the time.

24:36.918 --> 24:38.918
So it's not a big mystery to you,

24:38.920 --> 24:40.753
but, you know, the big problem,
really, at our house,

24:40.755 --> 24:43.222
is, uh, the fact
that my girls don't get along.

24:43.224 --> 24:45.675
They... they...
They fight constantly.

24:45.677 --> 24:48.877
Well, we all know divorce is hard.

24:48.879 --> 24:51.063
Oh, I only wish I was divorced.

24:51.065 --> 24:53.759
I'd take that any day
over being a widower.

24:55.486 --> 24:58.888
Your wife died?

24:58.890 --> 25:00.823
I am so sorry.

25:00.825 --> 25:04.910
Oh, my God.

25:04.912 --> 25:07.830
Thank you?
Do you wanna...

25:07.832 --> 25:09.615
Go someplace quieter?

25:09.617 --> 25:12.017
You know, where...
Where we can really talk?

25:14.304 --> 25:15.721
No. No, I'm good.

25:15.723 --> 25:18.224
I'm...
I'll tell you what.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.794
I'll give you my number.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.848
and you can call me when you're ready

25:25.850 --> 25:28.934
to go someplace quieter.

25:30.021 --> 25:32.404
<i>♪ when you're around</i>

25:32.406 --> 25:34.473
<i>♪ you'll be hanging around you ♪</i>

25:34.475 --> 25:36.942
<i>♪ hanging around you</i>

25:39.413 --> 25:42.248
you bastard. First time out,
you get a napkin kiss

25:42.250 --> 25:44.166
in under 15 minutes?

25:44.168 --> 25:45.668
You beat my best time.
How'd you do it?

25:45.670 --> 25:48.087
I have no idea.
She was bored to tears

25:48.089 --> 25:49.789
until I told her that my wife died.

25:49.791 --> 25:53.375
And then she asked if I wanted
to go someplace quieter.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.678
And you didn't go?
You know, as a lawyer,

25:55.680 --> 25:57.930
I could have you declared
criminally insane.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.348
Just didn't feel right.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.300
I mean, it felt like
she was taking pity on me.

26:01.302 --> 26:03.219
That's good. That's what
you want them to do.

26:03.221 --> 26:05.020
- It is?
- Yes.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.005
Women want men they can take care of,

26:07.007 --> 26:08.440
and that is you.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.193
The rest of us... we've got
ex-wives out there who hate us,

26:11.195 --> 26:13.395
but not you.
You've got no one.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.180
Man, you are set.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.899
It's the greatest pickup line
of all time.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.702
Losing my wife is the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.787
It's not a pickup line.

26:21.789 --> 26:22.788
So you're not gonna use it?

26:22.790 --> 26:24.356
Of course I'm not gonna use it.

26:24.358 --> 26:26.292
Is it okay if I do?

26:30.698 --> 26:33.198
Hey, morrissey,
look what I got for you.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.502
Some yummy bologna.

26:36.504 --> 26:37.920
Come on. You're killing me.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.807
Oh, God.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.226
Oh, no. Morrissey.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.211
Oh, no. Please don't be dead.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.680
Please don't be dead.
Please don't...

26:47.682 --> 26:50.432
Go away.
This is not a good time.

26:57.725 --> 27:00.109
For God sake.

27:01.194 --> 27:02.328
I need Carrie.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.246
She's not here.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.781
Fine. I'll take you.

27:05.783 --> 27:06.999
I didn't say you could come in.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.334
I'm in.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.619
As you can see...

27:10.621 --> 27:11.904
We have a situation.

27:11.906 --> 27:13.038
You call this a situation?

27:13.040 --> 27:15.090
I have five more
just like it in my room.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.793
No, th-this is bear-bear.

27:17.795 --> 27:19.011
Bear-bear is a memento
of the first time

27:19.013 --> 27:20.262
Walt and I kissed.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.797
Please. I just ate.

27:21.799 --> 27:24.500
I swore I wouldn't act like
a drama queen this time.

27:24.502 --> 27:26.886
Look at bear-bear.
Clearly, I am a drama queen.

27:26.888 --> 27:29.421
Well, you had to let the pain out.

27:29.423 --> 27:32.558
I did. I gave Walt
the best two years of my life.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.860
That's a long time.
That's like half your life.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.445
I know.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.598
This is my first real heartache.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.734
I feel that I need to play it out

27:41.736 --> 27:43.068
to fully acknowledge the significance

27:43.070 --> 27:45.237
of the relationship.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.240
Then he did not die in vain.

27:48.242 --> 27:52.678
Thank you, Dorrit.
You're very supportive.

27:53.830 --> 27:55.931
Carrie predicted I would act this way,

27:55.933 --> 27:58.467
and she was right.
She's always right.

27:58.469 --> 27:59.952
I hate that about her.

27:59.954 --> 28:01.370
She knew I'd lose my hamster.

28:01.372 --> 28:03.288
You lost your hamster?
I lost my boyfriend,

28:03.290 --> 28:06.225
so you know what I'm feeling.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.461
Kind of. Anyway, what do I...
What do I do with bear-bear?

28:13.350 --> 28:14.733
I can help.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.519
But while I'm doing this,
you have to look for my hamster.

28:17.521 --> 28:20.272
Don't use the bologna.
He's not interested.

28:22.525 --> 28:23.609
Peanut butter?

28:23.611 --> 28:25.411
I like it.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.833
<i>As Maggie went after her hamster,</i>

28:30.835 --> 28:32.651
Seth caught up with his mouse.

28:32.653 --> 28:34.987
I'm sorry. I was trying
to be cool and casual,

28:34.989 --> 28:36.171
but I can't do it.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.707
You kidding? I'm thrilled
to be out of there.

28:38.709 --> 28:40.676
You didn't like it?
Why didn't you say something?

28:40.678 --> 28:43.345
'Cause... seemed like
you really wanted to be there.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.997
No.

28:46.833 --> 28:49.051
I wanted to be having ice cream
at serendipity,

28:49.053 --> 28:50.519
but my friends said it'd be too dorky.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.771
But that's you.
You're dorky.

28:52.773 --> 28:55.507
Obviously, you're not
into that anymore.

28:55.509 --> 28:56.976
What makes you say that?

28:56.978 --> 28:58.610
You didn't even kiss me hello.

28:58.612 --> 29:02.014
I was going to, but you
were acting kind of weird.

29:02.016 --> 29:07.569
I'm sorry.
I screwed this up.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.354
Tonight was a total bust.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.123
Not a total bust.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.691
I got to see you.

29:14.494 --> 29:16.128
We can still get some ice cream.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.080
Yeah. I'm sure

29:18.082 --> 29:19.164
there's something else
in this neighborhood

29:19.166 --> 29:21.750
besides a vagina art exhibit.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.974
Take the throne!

29:28.976 --> 29:33.178
Take the throne!
Take the throne!

29:33.180 --> 29:36.148
Take the throne!
Take the throne!

29:36.150 --> 29:40.602
Take the throne!
Take the throne!

29:40.604 --> 29:43.155
Thank you. I'm flattered.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.859
But I-I'm gonna have
to pass.

29:50.897 --> 29:53.832
When did people get so precious
about their genitalia?

29:53.834 --> 29:55.584
I'd show my vagina,

29:55.586 --> 29:57.903
but I still got a penis.

29:57.905 --> 30:00.672
Are you mad?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.207
That was your big chance.

30:02.209 --> 30:03.575
Flashing strangers?

30:03.577 --> 30:05.427
I don't think I want that on my resume.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.812
Clearly, I've misjudged you.

30:06.814 --> 30:08.047
What do you mean?

30:08.049 --> 30:11.283
I thought one day you'd make
a name for yourself.

30:11.285 --> 30:14.252
You know, I could imagine
your picture on billboards

30:14.254 --> 30:16.755
and... the side of a bus.

30:16.757 --> 30:19.708
But you aren't willing
to own your power.

30:19.710 --> 30:24.313
Yes, I am. You may think
doing this is a good idea,

30:24.315 --> 30:27.316
and Monica Penny may think
it's a good idea,

30:27.318 --> 30:28.984
and everyone here may think
it's a good idea,

30:28.986 --> 30:30.936
but I don't.

30:30.938 --> 30:35.908
So I said no,
and that's me owning my power.

30:38.528 --> 30:41.547
You have a point.
Let's do lunch next week.

30:41.549 --> 30:43.248
Mwah. Mwah.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.633
Call me.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.636
<i>For the second time tonight,
I was right.</i>

30:47.638 --> 30:50.639
<i>But this time, I was running back.</i>

30:50.641 --> 30:55.460
Monica Penny had seen something
<i>in me... something strong.</i>

30:55.462 --> 30:57.262
<i>And maybe it was nuts, defining myself</i>

30:57.264 --> 30:59.815
<i>by what a retired porn star
thought of me,</i>

30:59.817 --> 31:02.818
<i>but she made me realize that
if I didn't define who I was</i>

31:06.190 --> 31:08.740
<i>And what I wanted was Sebastian.</i>

31:08.742 --> 31:12.381
And no man, not even my father,
<i>could stop me.</i>

31:18.981 --> 31:23.652
You know, I actually think
I prefer him this way.

31:23.654 --> 31:25.537
He's more interesting.

31:25.539 --> 31:27.322
I just wish I could have
found morrissey.

31:27.324 --> 31:29.324
I know I'll never see him again.

31:29.326 --> 31:32.410
Don't say that.
Of course you will.

31:34.247 --> 31:36.214
Mags!
What are you doing here?

31:36.216 --> 31:39.050
Bonding with your unexpectedly
cool little sister.

31:40.136 --> 31:42.737
Did she show you her hamster?

31:42.739 --> 31:44.389
Maybe next time.

31:44.391 --> 31:45.790
I should get going.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.043
Oh, hey, how was your night?
Did you see Sebastian?

31:48.045 --> 31:50.812
Mm, things didn't go
exactly as planned,

31:50.814 --> 31:52.647
but I'll be okay.

31:52.649 --> 31:53.682
Hmm.

31:53.684 --> 31:54.933
What happened to bear-bear?

31:54.935 --> 31:57.185
Things didn't go exactly
as planned for me either,

31:57.187 --> 31:59.137
but I am also gonna be okay.

31:59.139 --> 32:00.322
Good.

32:00.324 --> 32:02.824
Call you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.

32:02.826 --> 32:04.308
Bye.

32:04.310 --> 32:05.810
Is dad upstairs?
I need to talk to him.

32:05.812 --> 32:07.478
Not home yet.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.481
Guess I'll just wait up for him.

32:10.483 --> 32:11.983
You do that.

32:11.985 --> 32:14.786
I have some stuff I wanna try to find.

32:16.655 --> 32:19.290
My roommate is a major slob.

32:19.292 --> 32:20.992
I did ask, "can you at least clean up

32:20.994 --> 32:22.043
when my girlfriend visits?"

32:22.045 --> 32:24.179
- But the garbage is knee-deep.
- What?

32:24.181 --> 32:25.463
I'm not exaggerating,

32:25.465 --> 32:27.549
and the R.A. Thinks
it's funny.

32:27.551 --> 32:30.218
No, I mean, you just
called me your girlfriend.

32:30.220 --> 32:31.803
What, is that wrong?

32:31.805 --> 32:34.338
I thought you didn't like
using that word.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.674
Isn't that why we broke up?

32:36.676 --> 32:39.644
Mouse... I'm an idiot.

32:39.646 --> 32:41.446
I-I never had
a real girlfriend before you.

32:41.448 --> 32:42.597
I didn't know what it meant.

32:42.599 --> 32:45.700
I mean, did we have to talk every day?

32:45.702 --> 32:46.735
Would I have to write letters

32:46.737 --> 32:50.238
and spend every weekend on the train?

32:50.240 --> 32:51.990
But...

32:51.992 --> 32:55.460
I miss my girlfriend.

32:55.462 --> 32:57.695
Say it again.

32:57.697 --> 32:59.631
Girlfriend.

33:08.057 --> 33:11.976
<i>Mouse was happy.
She got the label she wanted...</i>

33:11.978 --> 33:13.711
<i>Girlfriend.</i>

33:16.048 --> 33:17.265
<i>While Maggie was accepting</i>

33:17.267 --> 33:20.435
<i>that was a label she had to let go.</i>

33:24.584 --> 33:28.810
<i>But she was learning to enjoy
another one...</i>

33:28.812 --> 33:31.112
<i>Drama queen.</i>

33:35.235 --> 33:36.334
You're home.

33:36.336 --> 33:40.004
Hi. Why are you still up?

33:40.006 --> 33:41.372
You need something?

33:41.374 --> 33:44.626
I need to talk to you
about your ban on Sebastian.

33:44.628 --> 33:46.461
Once again, this is not a topic...

33:46.463 --> 33:49.013
You don't have to say anything.
You just have to listen.

33:49.015 --> 33:51.800
I want you to know
that I respect your opinion,

33:51.802 --> 33:53.835
and I value your guidance,

33:53.837 --> 33:55.220
but I'll make my own decisions,

33:55.222 --> 33:57.755
and I've decided to see Sebastian.

33:57.757 --> 34:01.192
Carrie, there are things
that you don't know about...

34:01.194 --> 34:04.428
Like he had an affair with
a teacher at his last school?

34:05.564 --> 34:06.648
He told you?

34:06.650 --> 34:11.453
No. I read your file
on him.

34:11.455 --> 34:12.704
You did what?

34:12.706 --> 34:14.304
You can't write him off
because of one mistake.

34:14.306 --> 34:16.607
Fine. I won't.
Really?

34:16.609 --> 34:18.326
I'll write him off
because he's the cause

34:18.328 --> 34:21.012
of all your reckless
and irresponsible behavior.

34:21.014 --> 34:22.496
Reading my files?

34:22.498 --> 34:23.665
That is illegal.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.333
You jeopardize my career
because you don't like

34:25.335 --> 34:27.335
what I have to say about some boy?

34:27.337 --> 34:28.735
Th-this is not you,
Carrie.

34:28.737 --> 34:30.454
This is you under his influence.

34:30.456 --> 34:31.789
He is not just some boy.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.726
You are 16 years old.
I promise you, he is.

34:34.728 --> 34:37.512
You don't get to decide what is
and isn't important in my life.

34:37.514 --> 34:40.264
All he is to you
is some label on a file,

34:40.266 --> 34:41.516
not a person.

34:41.518 --> 34:43.351
He's a kid who made a mistake.

34:43.353 --> 34:44.819
And his parents can deal with him.

34:44.821 --> 34:47.355
I have to deal with <i>you.</i>

34:47.357 --> 34:49.440
I know that you're not perfect.

34:49.442 --> 34:53.143
I expect you
to make mistakes, but this...

34:54.663 --> 34:56.813
Will I ever be able to trust you again?

34:56.815 --> 35:00.251
Dad, please.

35:00.253 --> 35:06.252
You are not the Carrie Bradshaw
that I know.

35:23.806 --> 35:25.172
Dorrit?

35:27.143 --> 35:28.342
Dorrit?

35:28.344 --> 35:29.777
Go away!

35:31.613 --> 35:33.447
<i>With a new problem child on his hands,</i>

35:33.449 --> 35:37.185
<i>my father began to appreciate
his original problem child.</i>

35:37.186 --> 35:39.570
I, uh...

35:39.572 --> 35:41.322
Think this belongs to you.

35:41.324 --> 35:43.023
What?

35:43.025 --> 35:44.875
Morrissey!

35:44.877 --> 35:48.212
I, uh, found him
chewing on a stereo cord.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.531
Dorrit, you can't bring
animals into this house

35:50.533 --> 35:51.749
without consulting me.

35:51.751 --> 35:53.834
I know. I'm taking him
back to the store.

35:53.836 --> 35:56.821
Really? Okay.

35:56.822 --> 35:57.972
That was easy.

35:57.974 --> 36:01.392
Mom was nuts to say I could have one.

36:02.678 --> 36:04.095
Your mom said that?

36:04.097 --> 36:07.181
Yeah. For some reason,
she trusted me.

36:07.183 --> 36:09.717
How stupid was <i>that?</i>

36:11.787 --> 36:13.187
Your mother was not stupid,

36:13.189 --> 36:15.222
and if she wanted you
to have a hamster,

36:15.224 --> 36:19.327
then... you should
have a hamster.

36:19.329 --> 36:22.780
You mean...
I can keep him?

36:22.782 --> 36:27.001
Yeah, but feed him something
other than stereo cords.

36:27.003 --> 36:29.036
Oh, speaking of which,
I just filled up the freezer

36:29.038 --> 36:30.904
with stouffer's French bread pizza.

36:30.906 --> 36:33.624
One thing...
Your favorite, pepperoni.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.743
I'm a vegetarian.

36:35.745 --> 36:37.578
Since when?

36:37.580 --> 36:40.514
Last week.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good.

36:40.516 --> 36:42.300
Good. Keep me on my toes.

36:51.926 --> 36:54.061
I'm sorry about yesterday.

36:54.063 --> 36:57.264
Things did get pretty intense
pretty fast.

36:57.266 --> 36:58.532
But you didn't have to run away.

36:58.534 --> 37:01.535
Just... you're a lot more
experienced than me.

37:01.537 --> 37:02.770
Is that a problem?

37:02.772 --> 37:04.188
No.

37:04.190 --> 37:06.374
Well, that's not very convincing.

37:06.376 --> 37:08.609
I know about you and your teacher.

37:08.611 --> 37:12.112
What?

37:12.114 --> 37:13.297
I've given it a lot of thought,

37:13.299 --> 37:15.383
and I've decided that I'm fine with it.

37:15.385 --> 37:18.419
Uh...

37:18.421 --> 37:21.088
Well, how... how do you
even know about it?

37:21.090 --> 37:22.223
My dad wouldn't let me see you,

37:22.225 --> 37:23.591
so I went through his files.

37:23.593 --> 37:26.510
Wait, wait, wait.
Y-your dad has a file on me?

37:26.512 --> 37:29.230
Yeah, he was your lawyer.

37:29.232 --> 37:31.232
I had a lawyer?

37:31.234 --> 37:32.600
Nobody told me.

37:32.602 --> 37:34.352
Well, I guess your... your teacher
could've been charged,

37:34.354 --> 37:36.937
and your parents wanted
to keep your name out of it,

37:36.939 --> 37:38.639
so they hired my dad
to keep it hush-hush.

37:38.641 --> 37:40.941
That was pointless. Everybody
knows about it now, right?

37:40.943 --> 37:43.027
Yeah, but nobody cares.
I promise.

37:43.029 --> 37:45.996
I mean, if anything, they're impressed.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.482
Carrie, I don't give a crap
what you and your friends thinth

37:48.484 --> 37:49.917
you called me "Carrie."

37:49.919 --> 37:51.118
That's your name.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.070
But you always call me "Bradshaw"

37:53.072 --> 37:54.372
unless you're mad.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.657
Why do you analyze everything?

37:56.659 --> 38:00.711
I'm not. Or... or if I am,
I'll... I'll stop.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.631

38:03.633 --> 38:05.599

38:05.601 --> 38:06.934
My dad wouldn't tell me why
he didn't like you,

38:06.936 --> 38:09.970
and... I wanted to know why,
and... and then

38:09.972 --> 38:11.689

This isn't gonna happen.
