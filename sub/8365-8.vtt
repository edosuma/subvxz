WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:03.135
(Low hum of chatter)

00:07.174 --> 00:10.342
- They call this a candidates'
breakfast?!

00:10.344 --> 00:12.144
- Well, it can't be, Moira,

00:12.146 --> 00:14.246
there's a woman in cargo shorts.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.415
TWYLA: Good morning, Mrs. Rose.
Here's your name tag.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.017
- Oh, bless you, dear,
but a name tag

00:18.019 --> 00:19.752
does not go with this ensemble.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.387
- Oh, it's just so people
know who you are.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.222
Not that people won't know,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.457
when they see you
in that outfit.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.059
It's very shiny.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.461
- You're too kind.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.131
(Sighs) Well, I'm glad you
talked me out of the mohawk.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.066
I think these people deserve
a little glamour

00:34.068 --> 00:35.801
in their political campaign.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.103
I was always impressed
by those masquerade key parties

00:38.105 --> 00:39.538
at the Sarkosy's.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.473
ROLAND: Hey Johnny,
good morning to you.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.809
- Roland.
- How are 'ya?

00:43.811 --> 00:47.046
And Elvis! I'm so glad
you could make it.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.048
(Snickers)

00:49.050 --> 00:50.516
- Excuse me?!

00:50.518 --> 00:52.451
- Well, because you look like
Elvis in that...

00:52.453 --> 00:55.120
outfit there, you know, and...

00:55.122 --> 00:58.090
but the early Elvis, not the...

00:58.092 --> 01:00.592
(Grunts)
- Okay Roland, stop it.

01:00.594 --> 01:05.330
Moira, all anyone can talk
about is that outfit.

01:05.332 --> 01:06.932
Hah!

01:06.934 --> 01:09.301
You are a hit!

01:09.303 --> 01:12.371
- Huh, well no one has said
as such to me.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.239
- It's just that, you know,

01:14.241 --> 01:15.574
what you're wearing
is something that people

01:15.576 --> 01:17.376
around here aren't really
used to,

01:17.378 --> 01:19.378
or comfortable with.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.480
But that's what makes it great.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.349
- Oh, this is going to be
a fun campaign.

01:24.351 --> 01:27.086
- Yeah, I think it already is.
- Mhmm...

01:27.088 --> 01:28.554
(Uncomfortable sighs)

01:28.556 --> 01:32.891
♪ ♪

01:34.428 --> 01:36.462
BOB: Hey Johnny, you know
I like to keep some milk

01:36.464 --> 01:41.233
in the fridge for myself, uh...
and I noticed it uh...

01:41.235 --> 01:44.436
mm, some of it was missing.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.339
Well, I do admit I used
a bit of your milk,

01:47.341 --> 01:49.241
uh, to put in my coffee.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.976
- It looks more than
just a bit.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.913
I mean, the uh... the whole
bottle seems to be gone.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.915
- Well-- (Laughs)

01:56.917 --> 01:59.318
Well, it was very tasty,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.487
and naturally I'll reimburse
you for it.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.089
- Alright, well, give me seven
bucks, we'll call it even.

02:04.091 --> 02:07.092
- Seven dollars?!
- It's raw milk we're talking here,

02:07.094 --> 02:09.194
it's all natural,
unpasteurized,

02:09.196 --> 02:12.064
straight from the cow's breast,
to your mouth.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.399
- You paid seven dollars
a bottle for this?!

02:14.401 --> 02:16.635
- Where do you get it?
- Oh, Johnny, I--

02:16.637 --> 02:19.404
I'm not giving up my supplier.
I mean, uh...

02:19.406 --> 02:22.641
Unpasteurized milk is...
illegal.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.210
- Yeah, okay, Bob,
you know, I get it,

02:25.212 --> 02:28.046
but we're not talking
heroin here.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.882
- Okay well, you know,

02:29.884 --> 02:33.118
maybe you're used to being
on the wrong side of the law,

02:33.120 --> 02:36.321
but I for one am not going
to prison.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.558
- Gwen has already told me
she won't wait for me,

02:39.560 --> 02:44.663
so I'm counting on you
to be uh... discreet.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.966
- Right, okay Bob,
I'll keep it on the down low.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.603
- (Sighs)

02:51.605 --> 02:54.373
You know, if you expect me
to drive you to work,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.075
it would be nice if you
were ready on time.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.111
- I am ready!

02:59.113 --> 03:00.612
I just have to get my jacket,
change out of these shoes,

03:00.614 --> 03:01.947
and grab my bag.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.882
MOIRA: David? David!

03:03.884 --> 03:06.952
David, I have an urgent
campaign related question:

03:06.954 --> 03:09.321
I am approachable...

03:11.392 --> 03:14.493
- Is that a question?
- Yes, the question is:

03:14.495 --> 03:16.962
I am approachable...

03:19.033 --> 03:22.201
- That sounds more like a fact
that you're sharing with me.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.237
- Are you saying you disagree?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.739
- With your statement? Um...

03:27.741 --> 03:29.474
Well, Stevie actually is just
about to drive me to work--

03:29.476 --> 03:31.310
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.011
- So um, maybe I could give
that one a think?

03:33.013 --> 03:35.347
- Stevie! Stevie!
You're an average Joe-- Anne.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.482
You must have an opinion.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.386
- On what?
- About my approachability.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.288
Jocelyn seemed to insinuate

03:43.290 --> 03:45.257
that I am not at one
with the people.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.725
But I've always believed
that you lead

03:46.727 --> 03:49.728
with your best foot forward,
and the masses will follow!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.496
- You sound a bit like
a dictator.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.700
- Oh enough, David.
Stevie understands!

03:54.702 --> 03:56.001
- I'm trying to.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.270
- Yes! As a strong willed
modern woman,

03:58.272 --> 04:00.739
with a high school degree,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.208
you know how hard we have to
work to be taken seriously!

04:03.210 --> 04:05.510
- I actually went to college,
but sure.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.080
I would vote for you based
solely on the fact

04:08.082 --> 04:10.482
that you wore this outfit
to the cafe for breakfast.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.984
- Okay.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.253
DAVID: You know, being approachable
isn't that important anyway,

04:14.255 --> 04:16.054
The queen hasn't smiled
since the 70's,

04:16.056 --> 04:18.323
and her birthdays are still
very well attended.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.058
- Exactly! Wait.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.462
What are you saying?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.397
(Motorcycle rumbles)

04:31.672 --> 04:34.539
(Idling rumble,
engine cuts out)

04:36.310 --> 04:38.477
- Nice bike!

04:41.849 --> 04:44.516
Oh my go--! Oh my god!

04:44.518 --> 04:46.485
- Ted?
- Alexis!

04:46.487 --> 04:49.554
- (Gasps) You look good.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.491
Like, really good,
like, super...

04:52.493 --> 04:54.993
sun kissed, and muscle-y.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.663
- Thank you, I've been
working out a bit.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.432
And travelling, hit the beach
pretty hard for a few weeks.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.068
And boy, did it hit me back.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.270
- Good for you!

05:05.272 --> 05:07.039
I was wondering where
you ran off to.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.641
- Yeah well, it's actually
kind of a funny story.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.943
Do you remember that couples
vacation that I booked for us

05:11.945 --> 05:14.546
right before you broke off
our engagement?

05:14.548 --> 05:17.182
- Again, I'm-I'm super
sorry about that.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.685
- No, no, it's awesome.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.653
'Cause they actually gave me
the "Broken Hearts Special."

05:21.655 --> 05:23.255
Three extra nights
at no extra charge,

05:23.257 --> 05:24.856
as long as I could prove that
I didn't actually make it

05:24.858 --> 05:26.291
down the aisle.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.260
- Hmm! (Laughs)

05:28.262 --> 05:29.661
Look at you,
and now you have a bike!

05:29.663 --> 05:32.197
- Yeah! Yeah, no, I got almost
full price back

05:32.199 --> 05:33.632
for the engagement ring,

05:33.634 --> 05:35.400
and I've always wanted
one of these,

05:35.402 --> 05:38.236
and it cost less than the ring,
so...

05:38.238 --> 05:40.572
- Wow! So you're in like,

05:40.574 --> 05:42.507
a really good place right now?

05:42.509 --> 05:45.477
- Yeah, well, the beach
changes you.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.179
- Oh...yeah.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.613
- How about you?
What's going on?

05:48.615 --> 05:52.150
- Yeah, I've just been...
super busy as well.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.652
- Oh. Yeah no, I hear that.

05:53.654 --> 05:57.089
My day's been stacked,
doing rounds to some farms,

05:57.091 --> 06:00.592
checking on the animals,
and now some house calls,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.594
But I gotta say,
it's a lot more fun

06:02.596 --> 06:04.396
now that I've got this puppy.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.064
Pun intended.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.300
- (Laughs)

06:08.302 --> 06:09.835
Look at you!

06:09.837 --> 06:12.537
It's like if the
"Sons of Anarchy" had a vet.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.539
(Laughs)
- Yeah!

06:14.541 --> 06:15.807
Except they don't wear helmets
on that show,

06:15.809 --> 06:19.444
Which I get, but,
it's a little dangerous.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.380
Anyway, it's great
to see you, Alexis.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.583
- Totally.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.889
Ooh! Ahem!

06:32.559 --> 06:35.093
(Traffic rumbles)

06:37.297 --> 06:38.697
(Soft traditional Japanese music
plays)

06:48.342 --> 06:51.143
- David!
- Jocelyn! Hi.

06:51.145 --> 06:55.180
- Are you here picking up
something for yourself?

06:56.617 --> 06:59.551
- No. No, I um...

06:59.553 --> 07:01.520
I work here now.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.321
- Oh!
- So...

07:03.323 --> 07:05.457
- I usually just come here
when I need to kind of...

07:05.459 --> 07:07.526
freshen up my wardrobe.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.761
- I see, well, enjoy.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.597
- Just looking for a few
things for the campaign.

07:12.599 --> 07:16.768
A couple of pieces that might
catch the eye.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.737
- Got it.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.673
- I've got quite the stiff
competition with your mother.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.309
- Mhmm...
- Of course I wouldn't want to create

07:24.311 --> 07:27.913
a conflict of interest for you.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.415
- Got it.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.950
Well, I have brought in some
pretty decent pieces to the store,

07:31.952 --> 07:36.721
you're just gonna have to search
pretty hard for them, so...

07:36.723 --> 07:39.691
(Rock music plays,
diners chatter)

07:42.296 --> 07:44.296
- Twyla, I was just wondering,

07:44.298 --> 07:47.766
have you ever carried raw milk
in the restaurant?

07:47.768 --> 07:50.402
- Um, that's illegal, Mr. Rose.

07:50.404 --> 07:53.505
- Yeah.
- Between us,

07:53.507 --> 07:55.307
I had a bad experience
with black market milk.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.142
- Oh?
- Granted, I bought it from a man

07:57.144 --> 07:58.777
who I later found out
was a drifter.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.912
Anyway, it made a lot
of people sick,

08:00.914 --> 08:04.115
and I am almost positive now
it wasn't cow's milk.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.285
- Okay.
- It might've been elk's milk.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.721
Is elk's milk a thing?
- I don't know. I don't know.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.390
I'm just looking for someone
who sells raw milk.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.792
From a cow.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.494
- That's a big business
right now.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.295
- What's a big business
right now?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.297
- Raw milk.
- Shhh!

08:19.299 --> 08:22.868
You would make a terrible
drug dealer, Mr. Rose.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.871
- You're thinking about
becoming a drug dealer?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.706
- Ugh...
- I mean, I get it,

08:27.708 --> 08:30.442
it's fast money, and no one
would ever suspect you.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.878
- I'm thinking of selling
raw milk.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.480
- Oh. I don't think
that's right for you.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.682
- But selling drugs is?!

08:37.684 --> 08:39.851
- Okay, I had a friend in
Venice Beach who sold raw milk,

08:39.853 --> 08:42.654
and his entire compound
was raided.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.557
I mean, he also sold drugs,
but like...

08:45.559 --> 08:48.527
- Well, I just think
it can be profitable,

08:48.529 --> 08:51.396
if I can find a way
to capitalize on it.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.299
- Um... oh!

08:54.301 --> 08:56.601
I just saw Ted.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.336
Ted knows a lot of farmers,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.505
so maybe he can point you
in the right direction.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.541
- Oh okay, good, good.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.010
Good, maybe you can uh,
give him a call?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.779
- Mm, I just feel like that'd
be kind of awkward right now.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.650
- You know, your trail of
discarded boyfriends, Alexis,

09:11.652 --> 09:14.519
is making it very difficult
to get anything done

09:14.521 --> 09:17.556
in this world.
- Okay! I will call him.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.758
- Good, thank you.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.294
- I'll call him right after
my run today.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.730
Oh my God, okay,
I'll call him right now.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.500
- Good.
- Um...

09:28.502 --> 09:30.969
How much milk do we want?

09:30.971 --> 09:33.638
- Well, let's say twelve pints.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.707
And then, we'll see
where that gets us.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.009
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.914
Hmm...

09:46.954 --> 09:50.755
- Does this print come
in a different colour?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.992
- Uh, theoretically.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.294
Yeah, um... is it--
you're look--

09:56.296 --> 09:58.897
you want to have-you want
that in another colour?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.699
- Maybe?

10:00.701 --> 10:03.602
Unless you think that
there's another top

10:03.604 --> 10:05.737
that might be better.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.975
- Well, I mean, there are other
tops in the store.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.877
- Uh huh, okay well,
maybe you could,

10:12.879 --> 10:15.080
without being specific,

10:15.082 --> 10:17.983
point me in the general
direction of something

10:17.985 --> 10:20.819
that might be more suitable?

10:20.821 --> 10:23.021
- Hmm. Well, it's not really
up to me.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.091
Um, and I am supporting
my mother in this campaign.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.828
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- But if I were you, um...

10:29.830 --> 10:32.564
I might look for a...
a blouse maybe in...

10:32.566 --> 10:35.066
in this general area.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.603
Uh, maybe a- a skirt,
and a jacket.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.972
Maybe on this rack here.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.942
But again, it's all-
it's all you. So...

10:43.944 --> 10:45.777
- Okay!

10:45.779 --> 10:47.145
Thank you, David.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.382
- For what? I didn't do
anything.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.585
MOIRA: Good afternoon,
Jazzagals.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.588
I have a great warm-up exercise
I'd like to share with you.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.957
TWYLA: Oh! Okay, I think
we're just waiting for Jocelyn.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.226
- Again? I don't know how
anyone can one manage a town

11:01.228 --> 11:04.629
when they can't even manage
their own time.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.631
- Well, I guess we could
start without her.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.933
- Good! Because I was
thinking...

11:08.935 --> 11:12.904
we should get to know each
other.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.073
Well of course, you all
do know each other already,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.976
But I'd love for you
to get to know me.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.813
Does anyone have
any questions?

11:25.085 --> 11:27.852
TWYLA: (Laughs) I am just
trying to think.

11:27.854 --> 11:32.123
- Maybe this will help...
break the ice?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.592
GRACE: We don't usually drink
until after rehearsal.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.829
- Oh.
- Uh, unless of course the drinks are free!

11:37.831 --> 11:40.665
JAZZAGALS: Here, let me. Yeah.
Open it.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.867
- Thanks.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.206
(Keys jingle)

11:50.811 --> 11:52.977
(Lock rattles)

12:00.787 --> 12:02.854
(Door thuds)

12:04.691 --> 12:06.491
- Alexis?

12:14.634 --> 12:16.201
What is this?

12:16.203 --> 12:18.603
- The twelve things of milk
that you asked for.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.005
- The twelve "things" of milk?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.642
I didn't ask for twelve
"things" of milk,

12:24.644 --> 12:26.678
I didn't-I didn't say "things!"

12:26.680 --> 12:28.947
No, I asked for twelve pints!

12:28.949 --> 12:30.749
- Is there one missing?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.951
- Alexis!
- What?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.919
- These are not pints!

12:34.921 --> 12:38.256
Pints are little bottles!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.125
- Ohhh!

12:40.127 --> 12:41.926
Okay, 'cause I was wondering
why would Dad order

12:41.928 --> 12:44.362
$300.00 worth of milk?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.297
- This cost $300.00?!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.934
- Yeah, well like, three-ish.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.803
I don't... hmm.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.938
Um... okay well, $394.40,

12:55.242 --> 12:58.109
so I guess kind of closer
to $400.

12:58.111 --> 13:03.715
- Alexis, what am I gonna do
with $400.00 worth of raw milk?!

13:03.717 --> 13:06.050
- Sell it!
- To whom?!

13:06.052 --> 13:08.520
- To your customers!
- I don't have any customers!

13:08.522 --> 13:10.655
- Well then, why would you
order so much milk?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.690
- I didn't! You did!

13:12.692 --> 13:14.058
- Okay, why are you
yelling at me?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.927
- Why am I yelling?!

13:15.929 --> 13:18.263
- Ugh! I try and do something
nice for somebody,

13:18.265 --> 13:20.732
You think I would at least
deserve a "thank you!"

13:20.734 --> 13:22.133
- Oh well, thank you, Alexis,

13:22.135 --> 13:24.903
thank you for ordering
an insane amount of milk

13:24.905 --> 13:27.705
that I will never be able
to sell!

13:27.707 --> 13:29.174
- You're welcome!

13:41.354 --> 13:43.054
(Truck rumbles)

13:48.195 --> 13:50.762
- (Sighs) This is a lot
of raw milk, Johnny.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.230
- Oh, believe me, I know.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.065
- How many times do you want me
to apologize?!

13:54.067 --> 13:56.100
- Well, try one,
and let's see what happens.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.870
- Okay, I'm sorry you weren't
more clear about ordering milk!

13:58.872 --> 14:00.738
- Mm, not a proper apology.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.273
- Ugh! Okay, quiet, you two!

14:02.275 --> 14:05.109
You're scared, all right,
I get it.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.611
That's why you came to me.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.980
- We came to you because you
have a truck.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.982
- And because you know
if anybody can navigate

14:10.984 --> 14:14.018
the dark underworld of the raw
milk game, it's me.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.054
- You said it was a milk co-op.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.990
- Uh, it is, but these raw milk
guys can be loose cannons.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.725
Just remember,
if things go south,

14:20.727 --> 14:21.993
there's a loaded BB gun
in the back.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.895
ALEXIS: What is that?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.730
ROLAND: Oh my God, it's the
cops!

14:25.732 --> 14:28.099
(Brakes squeal)

14:28.101 --> 14:29.467
ALEXIS: Don't stop! JOHNNY: No, it's
nothing, it's probably an accident!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.870
ROLAND: I'm gettin' out of
here!

14:31.872 --> 14:33.338
JOHNNY: Roland, Roland! ALEXIS:
Stop, it's so conspicuous!

14:33.340 --> 14:34.672
- I know it's conspicuous!
- Close the door!

14:34.674 --> 14:36.174
- You're acting like I've never
done this before!

14:36.176 --> 14:37.976
- Roland, just drive,
just drive! Drive.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.310
ROLAND: Okay, okay, okay,
I'm driving.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.246
JOHNNY: Start driving, drive,
drive, drive! Okay?!

14:41.248 --> 14:43.114
- Okay, I'm driving, I'm driving!
ALEXIS: Okay.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.782
- A little quicker would be good!
- Yeah.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.284
- I'm driving, I'm going!
- It's just a checkpoint, okay?

14:46.286 --> 14:47.919
I've been through tons of these
in Johannesburg,

14:47.921 --> 14:51.356
um, it's like a drive thru,
except everybody has a gun.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.291
- When were you in
Johannesburg?!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.994
- I don't know, I remember
I just got my braces off, so--

14:55.996 --> 14:58.196
- You were 14,
in South Africa?!

14:58.198 --> 14:59.530
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!

14:59.532 --> 15:00.965
If this turns into
a fire fight, um...

15:00.967 --> 15:02.367
you're my human shield,

15:02.369 --> 15:04.936
and we'll use her
as a bargaining chip.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.237
- Yeah, okay, well,
that's not gonna happen.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.939
- Okay, I think the best
thing to do

15:07.941 --> 15:09.607
is just blow through
the checkpoint.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.277
- Yeah, we're not blowing
through anything, Alexis!

15:12.279 --> 15:16.180
- So then my Uncle Ralph
marries his third wife.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.216
What do you think her name was?

15:18.218 --> 15:20.084
- I don't know.
- Gayle!

15:20.086 --> 15:22.053
- The man marries three Gayles!

15:22.055 --> 15:23.521
(Jazzagals laugh)

15:23.523 --> 15:25.323
- Like didn't learn anything
from the first two!

15:25.325 --> 15:26.891
I mean, what is that?!
(Jazzagals laugh uproariously)

15:26.893 --> 15:30.094
JOCELYN: Sorry I am late, gals,
it's just been a crazy day.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.664
TWYLA: Wow, you look amazing!

15:32.666 --> 15:35.033
RONNIE: Somebody went
to the beauty salon!

15:35.035 --> 15:37.835
JOCELYN: Oh no, this is just
a little refresh.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.438
- It's very... very glamorous.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.775
So we've scrapped the whole
approachable angle, have we?

15:43.777 --> 15:47.445
- Who says this has anything
to do with the campaign, Moira?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.847
LENA: I love your top,
where'd you get it?

15:49.849 --> 15:51.282
- Oh, just a shop in Elmdale.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.151
MOIRA: Colour me impressed.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.087
It takes a real eye to find
something of quality

15:56.089 --> 15:58.356
at a clothier in Elmdale.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.224
- Oh no, just a little
bit of luck,

16:00.226 --> 16:02.994
and the right... salesperson.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.429
Any of that vodka left?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.432
RONNIE: Oh yeah, Moira brought
plenty.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.237
- And here I thought you were
against this type of campaigning.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.707
- Who says this has anything
to do with the campaign?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.642
(Vodka sloshes)

16:21.514 --> 16:23.414
(Roland groans)

16:23.416 --> 16:24.849
- Just remember,
no sudden movements,

16:24.851 --> 16:27.318
do not reach for the glove box,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.086
and not matter what happens do
not tell them your real name.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.154
- Uh huh...
- What?!

16:30.156 --> 16:31.789
(Roland pants, whimpers)

16:31.791 --> 16:33.649
WOMAN OFFICER: Turn off
your truck, please.

16:33.675 --> 16:34.392
ROLAND: Yes, sir.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.562
- Okay, who do we have here?

16:37.564 --> 16:39.230
- Oh, um...

16:39.232 --> 16:41.099
that's uh, Jennifer.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.268
And then he's um... Jacob.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.371
And then I'm also Jacob.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.208
Well, you can look at
our drivers' licences,

16:50.210 --> 16:51.642
if you don't believe me!

16:51.644 --> 16:54.178
- Oh, I don't think that'll be
necessary, Jacob.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.180
- Yeah, I'm just joking.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.016
We don't have drivers'
licences.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.351
- Um--
- No, yeah, we do have driver's licenses,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.687
we don't have those names
on our driver's license.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.223
WOMAN OFFICER: I'm gonna talk
to someone else.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.393
Jennifer?
- Actually, my birth name is Angelica.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.362
- We're out here today checking
for illegal game.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.431
Have you folks been hunting?

17:13.433 --> 17:16.334
JOHNNY: Hunting? No, no.
We don't uh, hunt.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.837
I mean, there's n-no hunting
going on here.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.339
No illegal-- yeah,

17:21.341 --> 17:24.409
you won't find any illegal game
here, that's for sure.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.144
- No!
(Roland and Alexis laugh)

17:26.146 --> 17:27.979
- So, what do you have there
in the back?

17:27.981 --> 17:30.848
- Um, actually, we're just
taking some milk to a co-op.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.517
- What kind of milk?

17:32.519 --> 17:34.085
- Cow milk.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.220
- So you three are dairy
farmers?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.955
- Mhmm...
- Yes, yes, dairy farmers.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.192
Hard work, hard work,
'Cause you get up you know,

17:41.194 --> 17:43.428
so early, but uh--
- But we love it.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.264
We do.
- You farm in that suit?

17:48.068 --> 17:50.468
- When the weather's good.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.905
- I'm gonna need you
to pull over, Jacob.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.543
- Jacob?
- Jacob.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.911
- Jacob?
- What?!

17:59.913 --> 18:01.579
- She wants you to pull over.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.047
- Oh, I'm- I'm sorry,
I thought you were talking

18:03.049 --> 18:05.016
to the other Jacob.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.185
(Truck rumbles)

18:11.558 --> 18:14.058
(David sighs)

18:14.060 --> 18:17.095
(Door creaks, slams)

18:17.097 --> 18:19.797
MOIRA: David? David, is that
you?

18:24.571 --> 18:26.370
- Yeah...

18:26.372 --> 18:29.874
- Will you come in here
a minute, please?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.512
- Uh huh?
- You've had a long day.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.314
Come sit.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.350
Don't be such a prickly pear.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.086
I just wanna check in
with my son.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.122
My first born.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.424
(Sighs)
- Mhmm...

18:46.426 --> 18:50.161
- So you're enjoying that
new job of yours?

18:50.163 --> 18:52.196
- Um, it's a job.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.465
So... sure.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.135
- I was wondering what kind
of customers do you get

18:57.137 --> 19:00.238
at a store like that?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.706
- Different kinds.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.307
Different people come in.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.376
- Are they mostly locals
from Elmdale,

19:05.378 --> 19:08.412
or do people travel
from far and wide

19:08.414 --> 19:12.216
to benefit from the expertise
of a David Rose?

19:13.520 --> 19:17.555
- Okay, well if someone
is looking for my advice,

19:17.557 --> 19:21.559
then I am more than happy
to provide.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.564
- I saw Jocelyn today.
- You did?

19:26.566 --> 19:30.034
- Mhmm, she looked
very different.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.836
Mostly improved,
though I must say,

19:31.838 --> 19:35.473
I didn't like the matchy matchy
skirt and blazer!

19:35.475 --> 19:37.708
No, she looked like
an aging stewardess

19:37.710 --> 19:40.444
from a Latvian airline!

19:40.446 --> 19:42.146
- I told her not to wear
the jacket with the skirt,

19:42.148 --> 19:43.848
so... I don't know.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.350
- And whose idea
was the hair thing?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.586
- I-I may have suggested...

19:51.291 --> 19:53.658
a slightly more contemporary
look.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.460
- I understand, I understand.
It's water under the bridge.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.596
- Well I'm sorry,
I felt very...

19:58.598 --> 20:00.298
conflicted about the whole
thing.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.433
- Of course you were.

20:02.435 --> 20:06.370
Now will you be a doll,
and fetch Mummy a knife?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.105
- A knife?
- Oh, I'm sorry,

20:08.107 --> 20:11.609
I think you'll find one lodged
in the middle of my back.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.878
- Okay, well, that's a lot.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.446
- And when you pull it
out of my back...

20:15.448 --> 20:16.781
- Okay, I'm gonna take
a shower.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.083
- ...you can plunge it
into my heart!

20:19.085 --> 20:20.585
- Okay, all right.

20:20.587 --> 20:24.655
- Plunge it into my heart!
(Sighs)

20:29.128 --> 20:31.395
(Milk sloshes)

20:34.234 --> 20:35.566
(Can rattles)

20:35.568 --> 20:37.134
- Thank you, Jacob.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.503
Have a good day.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.440
- Well, there it goes.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.376
- $400.00 worth of milk.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.245
- I feel like this is partly
my fault.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.747
- Partly?!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.515
- Roland was the one who
completely blew it back there!

20:51.517 --> 20:54.385
ROLAND: What?! Did you not see
me playing that cop?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.187
Oh my God, she didn't know
which way was up

20:56.189 --> 20:58.022
when I was done with her!

20:58.024 --> 21:00.124
- The smell of this milk
is making me super nauseous.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.927
- Oh come on, guys, let's not
end on a down note here,

21:02.929 --> 21:04.996
this was a good day,
let's end on an up note!

21:04.998 --> 21:07.531
- Enough Roland, just get
the cans in the truck, please.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.600
- Oh, okay. I'll grab one.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.135
- Pick it up and put it
on the truck!

21:11.137 --> 21:12.570
- Yes! Oh... okay.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.505
Grab that one,
put that on the truck,

21:14.507 --> 21:16.540
and then I'll organize the rest
so you can grab 'em,

21:16.542 --> 21:18.609
and put 'em on the truck.
