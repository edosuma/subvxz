18:44.475 --> 18:45.807
Um...

18:50.581 --> 18:51.513
Where is it?!

18:55.152 --> 18:56.418
Hey, what's going on?

18:56.487 --> 18:57.719
Anika hid the crown

18:57.788 --> 18:59.688
but she doesn't remember
where she put it.

18:59.757 --> 19:00.689
It's just temporary!

19:00.758 --> 19:02.124
I'll remember, I'll remember!

19:04.628 --> 19:05.694
Anika, this isn't funny.

19:06.764 --> 19:08.030
I'm not joking!

19:08.098 --> 19:09.064
(ANIKA PANTING)

19:09.133 --> 19:10.165
I knew I was a good hider.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.534
I just didn't know I was... that good.

19:13.771 --> 19:15.137
Oh!

19:15.205 --> 19:16.405
Come on... you need to help me!

19:35.426 --> 19:36.558
You can see there's nothing there!

19:36.627 --> 19:37.559
No, I just...

19:37.628 --> 19:38.827
(SCREAMING)

19:38.896 --> 19:39.861
- (TESS) Where is she going?
- Ahh...

19:41.965 --> 19:44.666
(EVIE) This is the only room
we haven't searched yet.

19:44.735 --> 19:45.667
I don't think Anika would have

19:45.736 --> 19:46.802
hidden it in here.

19:46.870 --> 19:48.070
This room's been compromised.

19:48.138 --> 19:50.038
Yeah, that's why
I hid it in the first place.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.573
I'm going to look anyway.

19:55.679 --> 19:56.611
If you think about it,

19:56.680 --> 19:59.448
this is the best way to hide something.

19:59.516 --> 20:01.450
No, it definitely isn't.

20:01.518 --> 20:03.819
I mean, if we can't find it,
how can the bad guys?

20:03.887 --> 20:05.887
I don't think I agree with
that line of reasoning.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.089
Well, she's not wrong.

20:07.157 --> 20:08.256
Thank you, Sal.

20:08.325 --> 20:09.257
Just weird.

20:09.326 --> 20:10.625
(ALL CHUCKLING) I know.

20:12.296 --> 20:13.395
(EVIE) Hey, guys, what's this?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.500
Did you find it?

20:18.569 --> 20:19.534
No.

20:20.938 --> 20:21.870
But look.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.408
What is it?

20:26.477 --> 20:27.676
(EVIE) I don't know.

20:27.745 --> 20:28.777
It's heavy.

20:30.447 --> 20:32.013
I think it's gold-plated.

20:32.082 --> 20:33.782
Or it could be real gold.

20:33.851 --> 20:36.051
I feel like I've seen
this somewhere before.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.756
Well, let's focus on
finding the crown first.

20:40.824 --> 20:41.857
Focus!

20:41.925 --> 20:43.425
Folk, fake!

20:43.494 --> 20:45.293
Fake cake!

20:45.362 --> 20:46.328
Table!

20:46.396 --> 20:48.130
Table, it's the table, it's the table!

20:48.198 --> 20:49.131
What is she talking about?

20:54.304 --> 20:55.637
(ANIKA) Ta-da!

20:55.706 --> 20:57.739
Is that a great hiding spot or what?

20:57.808 --> 20:58.940
A little too good maybe.

20:59.009 --> 20:59.941
No, no, no.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.477
It was just... perfect.

21:02.546 --> 21:03.779
Don't feel bad.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.514
You probably would have found it...

21:05.582 --> 21:07.516
eventually.

21:07.584 --> 21:08.717
(DOORBELL RINGING)

21:08.786 --> 21:09.818
(ERIK) I'll get it.

21:14.191 --> 21:15.123
Lucia.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.993
What brings you here?

21:18.061 --> 21:19.461
Hello, Erik.

21:19.530 --> 21:20.729
May I come in?

21:20.798 --> 21:22.597
Absolutely not.

21:22.666 --> 21:23.665
What's going on?

21:25.302 --> 21:26.668
Hi, Evie.

21:26.737 --> 21:27.869
Pack your bags, sweetie.

21:27.938 --> 21:28.970
You're coming with me.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.473
Lucia, I...

21:31.542 --> 21:32.908
I have some bad news for you, Erik.

21:32.976 --> 21:34.242
You can just add it to

21:34.311 --> 21:36.444
the rest of the bad news
you've been getting lately.

21:36.513 --> 21:37.646
What's this all about?

21:37.714 --> 21:39.915
You're gonna come live with me, sweetie.

21:39.983 --> 21:42.317
I'm gonna take you away
from these bad people.

21:42.386 --> 21:43.952
And when Erik is convicted...

21:44.021 --> 21:46.388
You mean "if" I am convicted.

21:46.456 --> 21:49.524
Just a formality
as far as I'm concerned.

21:49.593 --> 21:52.160
And when you are convicted,

21:52.229 --> 21:54.930
Evie will be placed back in my custody.
