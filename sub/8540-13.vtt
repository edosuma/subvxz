[trunk bell chirps]THIS IS THE GOOD LIFE
ON WHEELS, STEM TO STERN.

00:30.856 --> 00:34.643
HELL, THE TRUNK'S BIGGER

OH, MY GOD.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.952
LISELLE.

POSSIBLE SKULL FRACTURE.HER CLOTHES ARE STILL INTACT.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.534
NO OBVIOUS SIGNS

THAT NEW CAR SMELL.

00:59.842 --> 01:03.367
ANYTHING
ON THE TIME OF DEATH?SHE WAS LAST SEEN WORKING HERE
LATE LAST NIGHT.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.501
PRIVATE SECURITY
DID A SWEEP AT MIDNIGHT,

01:06.501 --> 01:09.939
REPORTED THE ALARM SYSTEM
HADN'T BEEN ACTIVATED.

01:09.939 --> 01:13.595
CORONER THINKS SHE WAS
PROBABLY DEAD BY THEN.LET'S GET THE BODY OUT OF HERE,
SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.032
[Rigsby] YEAH, YOU GOT IT.THAT'S EXPENSIVE, HUH?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.381
$300,000 RETAIL.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.470

01:23.561 --> 01:26.173
HEY, GUYS.
ONE OF YOU FOUND THE BODY?

01:26.173 --> 01:28.958
YEAH, JAMES KINSEY. I BELIEVE
HE'S IN THE JOHN RIGHT NOW.

01:28.958 --> 01:32.657
BRAD ELIAS.ANY IDEA WHO COULD HAVE
DONE THIS, MR. ELIAS?

01:32.657 --> 01:35.182
NO. NONE. IT WAS HORRIBLE.
THIS IS A TRAGEDY.

01:35.182 --> 01:38.098
WE'RE LIKE A FAMILY HERE.HA! FAMILY.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.448
THAT'S CUTE.EXCUSE ME?

01:40.448 --> 01:42.711
YOU WORK ON COMMISSION,
RIGHT?

01:42.711 --> 01:46.497
SURE.OKAY, THEN YOU'RE NOT A FAMILY
AT ALL. YOU'RE A GLADIATOR PIT.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.195
YOU'RE A SEETHING MASS

01:48.195 --> 01:50.110
OF PRIMAL HOSTILITY
AND MISTRUST.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.199
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.201
PEOPLE HAVE THE WRONG IDEA
ABOUT SALES.

01:54.201 --> 01:57.943
THERE'S A LOT OF RESPECT
AMONG US, RIGHT, GUYS?[man] OH, YEAH.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.250
CLEARLY YOU'RE A TOP DOG
AMONGST THIS PACK HERE,

02:00.250 --> 02:03.471
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
WHO'S THE FASTEST RUNNER?RUNNER?

02:03.471 --> 02:06.822
LISELLE'S CLIENTS ARE GONNA NEED
A NEW BROKER, AREN'T THEY?

02:06.822 --> 02:09.259
AND I THINK THAT MY ASSOCIATE,
AGENT CHO HERE,

02:09.259 --> 02:11.957
LEFT HER CLIENT LIST UPSTAIRS.
IN YOUR BREAK ROOM.

02:11.957 --> 02:15.265
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE GHOULISH
TO GRAB IT UP SO SOON,

02:15.265 --> 02:18.007
BUT IT IS STILL UP THERE,
AND SOMEONE,

02:18.007 --> 02:21.053
AT SOME POINT, WILL...

02:21.053 --> 02:23.404
I'VE GOT THE CLIENT LIST
RIGHT HERE. IT'S EVIDENCE.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.449
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

02:25.449 --> 02:28.452
I HAVE ELIMINATED THIS MAN
FROM ANY SUSPICION.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.673
TOO HONEST TO PROFIT FROM
A KILLING? TOO HONEST TO KILL.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.153
RIGHT?RIGHT.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.024
[grunting]

02:35.024 --> 02:37.896
HEY, GUYS, BREAK IT UP.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.290
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE VERY CUNNING

02:40.290 --> 02:43.206
AND YOU'RE WORKING
A DOUBLE BLUFF.[Cho] COME ON. TAKE IT--
HEY, COME ON.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.208

02:45.208 --> 02:47.297
[Cho] COME ON. COME ON.

02:47.297 --> 03:00.005
COME ON. BREAK IT UP.
BREAK IT UP. COME ON, GUYS. HEY.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.443
LISELLE DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR WORK YESTERDAY.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.228
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.
IT WASN'T LIKE HER.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.838
YOU WERE WORRIED?

03:06.838 --> 03:09.841
I WAS PISSED. HOSTING THE PARTY
WAS HER RESPONSIBILITY.

03:09.841 --> 03:12.714
IT'S A GOOD THINK
THAT KINSEY STEPPED UP.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.282
HEARD YOU BOYS
DIDN'T PLAY NICE LAST NIGHT.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.284
NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.677
YOU LIKE YOUR EMPLOYEES
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS?

03:19.677 --> 03:22.289
YOU BET I DO.
THIS IS A JOB FOR WINNERS.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.682
WE'RE THE TOP LUXURY BROKER
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.771
WE GOT FOUR FLOORS OF STOCK
BACK THERE.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.557
WE GOT OVER $100 MILLION
IN SALES ANNUALLY.

03:29.557 --> 03:32.908
MY GUYS HAVE TO EARN
THEIR PLACE.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.302
SO EVERY SIX MONTHS
WE HAVE A SALES DRIVE.

03:35.302 --> 03:38.653
[claps hands]TOP GUY ON THE BOARD GETS
A TITANIUM DIAMOND ROLEX.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.612
BOTTOM GUY...
GETS A NEW JOB.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.572
LOOK, AGENTS,

03:44.572 --> 03:48.140
NOT TO PRESS--MY CLIENTS WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW WHEN WE CAN REOPEN.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.927
WHAT CAN I TELL THEM?YOU CAN TELL THEM
A WOMAN'S DEAD.

03:51.927 --> 03:55.191
WHICH IS TERRIBLE, UH,
BUT THIS IS A SERVICE BUSINESS.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.020
AND WHEN SHARKS STOP SWIMMING,
THEY DROWN, RIGHT?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.332
[claps hands]NO MALINGERING, GUY.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.725
[chuckles]THIS IS JAMES KINSEY.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.206
AH.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.991
AH, TOP SALESMAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.820
THANKS.DAMN RIGHT. THIS GUY
COULD SELL A CAT TO A MOUSE.

04:15.820 --> 04:20.172
AH, I MIGHT HAVE TO THROW IN
A FEW EXTRAS TO CLOSE THAT DEAL.[chuckles]

04:20.172 --> 04:23.219
MR. WESTHOFF HERE SAYS
YOU WERE WORKING WITH LISELLE

04:23.219 --> 04:26.309
THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.YEAH, WORKING
ON LAST NIGHT'S PARTY, SURE.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.312
I LEFT HER HERE
ABOUT, UH, 8:00, 8:30.HOW'D SHE SEEM--HER DEMEANOR?

04:29.312 --> 04:32.620
FINE, I GUESS.
UH, A LITTLE TENSE, MAYBE.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.622
A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET
THAT PARTY TOGETHER.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.407
HEY. HEY.
THAT--THAT'S--THAT'S MINE.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.800
THAT.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.845
OKAY.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.760
NOW HOW'D YOU AND LISELLE
GET ALONG?

04:42.760 --> 04:45.459
UH, GREAT.
SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.851
GREAT?

04:46.851 --> 04:49.680
BUT YOU RESENTED HER.NO.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.813
YES.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.598
WHY WAS THAT? SHE WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK,

04:54.598 --> 04:57.079
SO SHE WAS NO THREAT TO YOU.

04:57.079 --> 05:00.517
LISELLE DID VERY WELL
FOR HER AGE.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.520
SHE DID VERY WELL
BECAUSE SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.740
AND YOU FELT THAT GAVE HER
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.743
[laughs] HEY, SEX SELLS.
THAT'S A FACT OF LIFE.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.875
OH, YEAH.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.704
LISTEN, HER ACTUAL
PITCHING SKILLS--BUSH LEAGUE.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.533
YOU PUT A BAG ON HER,
LISELLE COULDN'T SELL SQUAT.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.362
EVER ASK HER OUT?YEAH.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.582
HOW'D THAT GO FOR YOU?

05:21.582 --> 05:23.888
UH, SHE SAID NO. BOYFRIEND.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.977
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.893
UM, UH, JEFF. JEFF SOMEBODY--
MUSICIAN, WANNABE ROCK STAR.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.852
YEAH, SHE WAS
ALWAYS BITCHING ABOUT HIM.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.506
ALWAYS DRAMA WITH THOSE TWO.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.248
BOYFRIEND IS JEFF SPARHAWK.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.599
THE VICTIM HAD A LOFT WITH HIM
SOUTH OF MARKET.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.515
HERE'S THE ADDRESS.JANE AND I WILL LOOK INTO IT.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.082
YOU CHECK
OUT HER FINANCIALS.YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, BOSS?

05:44.082 --> 05:48.652
ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO SEE BOTH
OF YOU. SHUT THE DOOR. SIT DOWN.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.794
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.884
THE OTHER DAY YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE INVOLVED

06:02.884 --> 06:06.583
IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
WITH EACH OTHER.YES.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.977
DATING WITHIN THE UNIT IS

06:08.977 --> 06:11.893
STRICTLY AGAINST
CBI REGULATIONS.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.766
I WANTED TO TAKE SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND,

06:15.766 --> 06:18.769
BUT I REALIZE
THAT IT'S CAUSING TENSION, SO...

06:20.815 --> 06:23.208
AGENT RIGSBY AND VAN PELT,

06:23.208 --> 06:26.951
ARE YOU INVOLVED IN A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.519
YES.WE ARE.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
OKAY, THEN.

06:31.042 --> 06:34.045
AS YOUR SUPERVISOR, I HAVE
TO REPORT THE RELATIONSHIP

06:34.045 --> 06:36.526
TO EMPLOYEE SUPPORT SERVICES.
I'M GONNA DO IT

06:36.526 --> 06:38.876
AS SOON AS
WE CLOSE THIS CASE.

06:38.876 --> 06:41.618
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

06:41.618 --> 06:45.187
BUT THEY'LL MAKE ONE OF US
TRANSFER OUT OF THE UNIT.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.189
YES, THEY WILL.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.060
THAT'S THE RULE.
YOU KNEW THAT.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.676
YOU CAN GO NOW.

07:04.815 --> 07:08.210
WHERE THE HELL IS 4-B?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.560
[thunder rumbles in distance]I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.737
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT IT.WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:13.737 --> 07:17.088
WELL, THAT YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT RIGSBY AND VAN PELT.NO, I DON'T.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.308
WELL,
YOU CAN'T HELP WONDERING

07:19.308 --> 07:22.833
IF THERE'S A HINT OF JEALOUSY
AND RESENTMENT IN YOUR DECISION.EXCUSE ME?

07:22.833 --> 07:24.835
[loud thumping]

07:24.835 --> 07:26.315
AH.

07:26.315 --> 07:29.492
[door squeaks open]

07:29.492 --> 07:32.452
MR. SPARHAWK?[clatter]

07:32.452 --> 07:35.672
WE'RE WITH THE CALIFORNIA
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.065
[pants]

07:37.065 --> 07:39.763
CALIFORNIA WHAT?

07:39.763 --> 07:43.724
WE WANT TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT LISELLE.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.901
YOU WANT TO PUT DOWN
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR GUITAR?

07:46.901 --> 07:49.817
YEAH. WHATEVER.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.253
[thud]

07:51.253 --> 07:53.995
I'LL MAKE SOME TEA.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.565
WHY ALL THE DEMOLITION,
JEFF?

07:58.565 --> 08:01.655
I'M SAD. I LIKE
TO DESTROY THINGS WHEN I'M SAD.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.919
WELL, SOME SADNESS,
BUT MOSTLY GUILT,

08:04.919 --> 08:07.356
A DOLLOP OF SELF-PITY,

08:07.356 --> 08:09.924
TINGLE OF EXCITEMENT.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.493
SO YOU'RE A MUSICIAN?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.364
ALL RIGHT.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.800
YOU ANY GOOD?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.759
NO.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.718
YOU'RE OKAY. I COULD TELL
LISELLE WAS A WOMAN OF TASTE.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.851
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LOVED
A BAD MUSICIAN.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.330
YEAH.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.550
I'M GREAT. HUGE.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.727
LAST YEAR I MADE $9,000
FOR MY MUSIC.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.556
WELL, THAT'S $9,000 MORE THAN
VAN GOGH EVER MADE FROM HIS ART.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.949
[chuckles and sniffles]

08:34.949 --> 08:36.994
YEAH,
THINGS WORKED OUT FOR HIM.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.736
OKAY. SO, UM, LISELLE
WAS THE BREADWINNER?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.391
YEAH. HER CUT ON AN ASTON...

08:42.391 --> 08:44.436
[sniffles] COULD KEEP US GOING
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,

08:44.436 --> 08:47.222
SO I COULD CONCENTRATE
ON MY MUSIC.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.964
SHE DID IT FOR ME.
SHE HATED THAT JOB.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.792
DID THAT EVER CAUSE TENSION
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.750
SURE.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.839
COUPLES FIGHT.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.059
I DIDN'T LIKE HER WORKING
AT THAT PLACE, BUT...

08:58.059 --> 09:01.149
YOU NEEDED THE MONEY.
IT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

09:01.149 --> 09:04.021
SHE WAS GETTING HIT ON
ALL THE TIME

09:04.021 --> 09:06.981
BY RICH EGOMANIACS, OKAY?

09:06.981 --> 09:09.026
IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU JEALOUS,
RIGHT?

09:09.026 --> 09:11.768
GUYS, UH,
GUYS TRY TO GIVE HER STUFF.WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

09:11.768 --> 09:14.945
YOU KNOW,
UH, JEWELRY, PERFUME,

09:14.945 --> 09:18.819
STUFF LIKE THAT.
LISELLE ALWAYS SENT IT BACK.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.865
WHY?OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME.

09:21.865 --> 09:26.000
OR IF SHE COULDN'T GIVE IT BACK,
SHE GAVE IT AWAY.NOT ALL OF IT.

09:28.002 --> 09:31.701
THIS IS VERY VALUABLE.

09:31.701 --> 09:35.531
LISELLE SAID IT WAS
TOO VALUABLE TO GET RID OF.

09:35.531 --> 09:38.578
SHE SAID WE'D USE IT TO, UH,
PAY FOR OUR WEDDING.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.668
WHO GAVE HER THE PRINT?

09:41.668 --> 09:45.019
[crying] I'VE DONE BAD,
STUPID THINGS.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.630
I NEVER DESERVED HER.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.589
AND NOW SHE'S GONE. GOD.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.199
OH, STOP.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.027
SELF-PITY'LL KILL YOU.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.814
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE THAT KNOWS.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.077
JEFF SPARHAWK
HAS NO ALIBI.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.558
YOU CAN DISPENSE
WITH THE COP TALK, LISBON.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.517
YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.NOTHING'S BOTHERING ME.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.955
OKAY.NOTHING IS BOTHERING ME.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.218
MESSAGE RECEIVED.GOOD.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.307
SPARHAWK--NO ALIBI, YEAH?

10:12.307 --> 10:13.961
MM.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.006
[car doors close][Lisbon] BY THE WAY,

10:16.006 --> 10:17.965
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'M JEALOUS AND RESENTFUL?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.619
IT WAS NONSENSE.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.099
[Patrick] YET YOU RECALL
MY EXACT WORDS.

10:22.099 --> 10:25.712
THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT. I FEEL
THAT WAY, TOO, SOMETIMES.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.671
WHY DOES EVERYONE ELSE
GET TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE?

10:28.671 --> 10:30.194
MY LIFE IS FINE.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.893
NORMALLY YOU RISE ABOVE
SUCH CRAVEN EMOTIONS,

10:32.893 --> 10:35.286
BUT IN THIS CASE,
YOUR HANDS WERE TIED.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.288
IT'S THE RULES.
YOU'RE FORCED TO DO

10:37.288 --> 10:40.291
WHAT YOUR WORST SELF IS
TELLING YOU TO DO ANYWAY.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.380
HENCE, YOUR TENSION HEADACHE.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.253
I DON'T...

10:45.253 --> 10:47.037
ALL RIGHT.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.605
I-I DO HAVE A HEADACHE,
BUT THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.172
NAH.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.174
EITHER I OBEY THE RULES

10:53.174 --> 10:55.655
OR I RISK TAKING BIG HEAT
FOR IGNORING THEM.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.267
THIS IS ON VAN PELT
AND RIGSBY, NOT ME.WHATEVER YOU SAY.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.878
[cell phone rings]LISBON.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.489
[Van Pelt] Hey, I found
something on that print.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.318
IT SOLD AT AUCTION
IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR,

11:07.318 --> 11:10.365
PURCHASED BY WALTER MASHBURN
FOR 30 GRAND.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.759
MASHBURN. SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
[mouths word]

11:12.759 --> 11:14.717
HE FOUNDED MASHBURN AVIONICS,

11:14.717 --> 11:16.719
SOLD IT TEN YEARS AGO
FOR BILLIONS.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.678
HE WAS ALSO LISELLE DOUGLAS'
LAST APPOINTMENT

11:18.678 --> 11:20.244
THE DAY SHE DIED.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.686
DID YOU NOTICE THE BADGE,
OR SHOULD I SHOW YOU AGAIN?

11:26.686 --> 11:30.124
I'M SO SORRY, BUT I CAN'T SAY
IF MR. MASHBURN IS HERE OR NOT.

11:30.124 --> 11:33.475
WE'RE A PRIVATE CLUB, AND OUR
MEMBERS TREASURE THEIR PRIVACY.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.346
[whispers] DON'T WORRY.
I'LL FIND HIM.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.349
[indistinct conversations]

11:38.349 --> 11:40.787
W--EXCUSE ME, SIR.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.837
WELL, HELLO THERE.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.665
THE DECK, CORNER TABLE?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.928
HUH?

11:51.928 --> 11:54.061
OH, YOU MUST BE NEW.
WALTER MASHBURN.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.848
I LIKED LISELLE.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.763
SMART WOMAN. DAMN SHAME.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.026
AND YOU GAVE HER
AN EXPENSIVE GIFT.

12:03.026 --> 12:06.029
YES.WERE YOU SLEEPING WITH HER?

12:06.029 --> 12:09.424
[chuckles] IF I SLEPT
WITH EVERYONE I GAVE GIFTS TO,

12:09.424 --> 12:11.861
I WOULDN'T GET
ANY WORK DONE...

12:11.861 --> 12:16.779
OR ANY SLEEP,
FOR THAT MATTER.BUT YOU PROPOSITIONED HER,
AND SHE SAID NO.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.215
[chuckles]

12:18.215 --> 12:19.739
PERCEPTIVE.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.482
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC,
AREN'T YOU?

12:24.482 --> 12:27.050
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

12:27.050 --> 12:29.009
YOU HAVE THIS CHARLATAN AIR
ABOUT YOU.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.314
[chuckles]

12:30.314 --> 12:32.621
MY SECOND...

12:32.621 --> 12:35.929
NO, MY THIRD WIFE WAS INTO
ALL THAT MYSTICAL GOOP.

12:35.929 --> 12:39.193
MM-HMM.YOU LEARN
TO RECOGNIZE THE TYPE.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.848
HOW MANY WIVES HAVE YOU HAD?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.850
[chuckles]
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.765
BUT I'M CURRENTLY
UNATTACHED.

12:48.985 --> 12:52.989
SO WERE YOU SLEEPING
WITH LISELLE OR NOT?

12:52.989 --> 12:55.600
NOT.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.733
THAT PRINT WAS A REWARD

12:57.733 --> 13:00.910
FOR FINDING ME AN AUSTIN HEALEY
2-SEATER FROM 1960.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.521
THERE WAS
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MADE.MM-HMM.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.829
SHE EARNED THAT GIFT.AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAD
WITH HER THE DAY SHE DIED?

13:06.829 --> 13:09.789
TO PICK THE CAR UP.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?NO, THANKS.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.834
I'D LOVE TO.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.011
YOU HAVE A DAMAGED INTENSITY
THAT'S QUITE ATTRACTIVE.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.839
MM. YEAH.

13:16.839 --> 13:20.843
LET ME BUY YOU
A DRINK SOMETIME.I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.759
I HAVE A JET.OH, YOU'RE VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.980
I HAVE ONE QUESTION--
UH, DID YOU KILL LISELLE?

13:28.895 --> 13:31.332
HMM?

13:31.332 --> 13:34.901
JAKE, CHECK, PLEASE.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.033
LET ME SHOW YOU FOLKS
SOMETHING.

13:37.033 --> 13:41.037
[Walter] SMUGGLERS CALL 'EM
GO-FAST BOATS--SAYS IT ALL.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.866
NOTHING LIKE FLYING
ACROSS THE OCEAN AT 80 KNOTS

13:43.866 --> 13:45.520
TO GET THE BLOOD GOING.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.739
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME FOR A RIDE?

13:47.739 --> 13:50.046
WE GET IT.
YOU'RE AN ENERGETIC MAN.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.832
YOU LIKE DANGER.
SO WHY BRING US HERE?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.790
I HAVE NO LOVE FOR DANGER.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.837
NOTHING'S DANGEROUS
IF YOU THINK AHEAD.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.448
IF YOU PLAN IT RIGHT,
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH...

14:00.448 --> 14:03.668
WELL, I WAS GONNA SAY YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH MURDER, BUT...

14:03.668 --> 14:06.976
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.760
OKAY. SO...

14:08.760 --> 14:12.155
WHAT'S THE POINT IN SHOWING US
YOUR FANCY TOY HERE?

14:12.155 --> 14:15.942
THIS IS HOW I LIVE MY LIFE.
I HAVE A CASTLE IN SCOTLAND,

14:15.942 --> 14:18.901
A COMPOUND ON THE WATERFRONT
IN MARIN.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.861
IF I KILLED LISELLE,
WOULD I STUFF HER IN THE TRUNK

14:21.861 --> 14:25.299
LIKE SOME LOW-RENT THUG?HOW WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.344
SHE WOULD HAVE
JUST DISAPPEARED,

14:27.344 --> 14:30.826
LIKE SMOKE,
LIKE SHE WAS NEVER THERE.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.873
YOU ENJOY BEING
A MURDER SUSPECT, DON'T YOU?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.484
AM I? A SUSPECT?

14:36.484 --> 14:39.139
OF COURSE. IT COULD BE
YOU'RE A SOCIOPATH,

14:39.139 --> 14:41.968
OR IT COULD BE THAT KILLING IS
A THRILL THAT YOU CAN'T BUY.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.320
NOT A LOT EXCITES YOU ANYMORE,
DOES IT, WALTER?

14:46.320 --> 14:50.019
PATRICK, IF YOU REALLY THINK
I KILLED LISELLE,

14:50.019 --> 14:53.718
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR YOU TO DO.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.591
TRY AND CATCH ME.[boat engine starts]

15:09.604 --> 15:11.432
THAT COULD BE YOU.

15:16.089 --> 15:19.048
MASHBURN'S GOT ZERO PRIORS,
BUT HE'S BEEN INVESTIGATED

15:19.048 --> 15:22.530
FOR SEVERAL
SHADY BUSINESS DEALS.BUT THEY NEVER FOUND
ANYTHING.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.881
LEGIT BUSINESS GENIUS,
IT SAYS HERE.HE THINKS HE'S A GENIUS.
HE'S A PIRATE THAT GOT LUCKY.

15:25.881 --> 15:29.667
HE'S GOTTEN EVERYTHING HE WANTED
SINCE HE WAS 30 YEARS OLD.EXCEPT YOU.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.626
WAIT. WALTER MASHBURN
ASKED YOU OUT?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.323
NO.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.675
WELL, SORT OF.WOW.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.895
PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT
SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR IT.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.463
A LITTLE EMPTY GLAMOUR
WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR HER.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.466
BUT, NO, NOT OUR LISBON.RIGSBY, WHY DON'T YOU GO

15:45.466 --> 15:48.469
AND TALK TO HIS ALIBI,
THE SWIMSUIT MODEL?

15:48.469 --> 15:51.994
OH, SURE, YEAH, THE SWIMSUIT
MODEL. UH, NO PROBLEM.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.604
THE ALIBI WILL BE SOLID,
WHETHER HE DID IT OR NOT.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.824
CHECK ANYWAY.I GOT SOMETHING.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.392
IT SEEMS WESTHOFF,
THE BOSS AT ZENITH MOTORS,

15:58.392 --> 16:00.568
REPORTED A FERRARI DISAPPEARED
FROM THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT

16:00.568 --> 16:03.484
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.
BUT AN HOUR LATER,

16:03.484 --> 16:06.574
WESTHOFF CALLED THE SHERIFF BACK
AND SAID NEVER MIND.SO HE FOUND THE CAR?

16:06.574 --> 16:09.403
[Cho] DIDN'T SAY.WE NEED TO FIND OUT.
I GOT THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.448
LISELLE DIED
OF MAJOR HEAD TRAUMA

16:11.448 --> 16:13.494
CAUSED BY FORCEFUL CONTACT
WITH THE PAVEMENT.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.844
THAT PUT TOGETHER WITH
SKIN ABRASIONS, BONE FRACTURES--

16:15.844 --> 16:18.803
SHE WAS HIT BY A CAR.WELL, IF A CAR IS
THE MURDER WEAPON,

16:18.803 --> 16:20.936
IT'LL HAVE TRACE EVIDENCE
ON IT--BLOOD, D.N.A.--

16:20.936 --> 16:23.069
EVEN IF THE KILLER WASHED IT.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.680
TALK TO WESTHOFF. D.N.A.
EVIDENCE DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.OKAY.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.465
[whistles] WHOO.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.469
I'M OUT SICK TWO DAYS,

16:32.469 --> 16:36.430
AND YOU GIVE THE TARLEN ACCOUNT
TO LEGLER?YOU'VE BEEN SICK ON AND OFF
FOR A MONTH.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.476
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
I GOT A STOMACH BUG.HEY, NO FREE RIDES.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.436
YOU EAT WHAT YOU KILL HERE--
THAT'S RULE NUMBER ONE.DON'T TELL ME ABOUT RULES,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.655
THIS IS ME TALKING.OH, YOU?

16:44.655 --> 16:47.571
YEAH.YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE
OF US HERE IS THE MAN.

16:47.571 --> 16:50.574
[knock on door]HEY, GUYS.
ARE WE INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.927
MANAGEMENT SEMINAR.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.625
TRADITIONALLY
IN THESE DOMINANCE DISPLAYS,

16:57.625 --> 17:01.237
IT'S CUSTOMARY TO, UH,
BARE ONE'S CANINES.

17:03.239 --> 17:07.156
SOME SPECIES GO SO FAR AS
EXPOSING THEIR GENITALS. YEAH?

17:07.156 --> 17:11.073
1986 FERRARI TESTAROSSA--
BELONGS TO AN ALEXA LANDAU,

17:11.073 --> 17:14.903
AND IT DISAPPEARED FROM YOUR
SERVICE DEPARTMENT. WHERE IS IT?I DON'T KNOW.

17:14.903 --> 17:19.429
THEN WHY'D YOU TELL THE COPS
"NEVER MIND"?'CAUSE I TOLD HIM THE OWNER'S
HUSBAND MAY HAVE TAKEN THE CAR.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.346
WE TRY NOT TO CALL THE POLICE
ON OUR CLIENTS.HE STOLE
HIS OWN WIFE'S CAR?

17:23.346 --> 17:25.392
YEAH,
LANDAUS ARE SPLITTING UP.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.482
YOU KNOW, RICH PEOPLE AND THEIR
FRICKIN' SOAP OPERA LIVES.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.441
APPARENTLY, THE HUSBAND TOOK
THE CAR TO VEGAS, PARTIED HARD,

17:31.441 --> 17:35.010
LEFT THE CAR A MESS.
NOW ALEXA'S PISSED.AND BEFORE SHE JETS OFF
TO MILAN,

17:35.010 --> 17:38.579
SHE BRINGS IT IN
TO BE DETAILED,

17:38.579 --> 17:41.930
SPECIFICALLY TELLS KINSEY NOT
TO LET HER PIG HUSBAND NEAR IT.

17:41.930 --> 17:45.107
HE TELLS ME THIS LATER.[Cho] AND YOU THINK THE HUSBAND
DIDN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER?

17:45.107 --> 17:48.284
NOAH LANDAU'S
A BIG RECORD PRODUCER,

17:48.284 --> 17:51.722
NOT REALLY KNOWN FOR HIS IMPULSE
CONTROL. AND HE LOVES THAT CAR.NOAH LANDAU WAS
AT THE COCKTAIL PARTY

17:51.722 --> 17:54.421
WHEN LISELLE'S BODY WAS
DISCOVERED. I'LL TALK TO LISBON.

17:54.421 --> 17:58.033
MM. "RICH PEOPLE AND THEIR
FRICKIN' SOAP OPERA LIVES."

17:58.033 --> 18:01.602
YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE RICH
PEOPLE MUCH, DO YOU, KINSEY?ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LOVE 'EM.

18:01.602 --> 18:05.214
I'M ON THE WAY UP, MY FRIEND.
RICH PEOPLE ARE TAKING ME THERE.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.216
WELL, SOMEDAY,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.871
LANDAU IS DINING AT SOME
LAVISH RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.481
SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE

18:11.481 --> 18:13.483
FROM HIM IS A WOMAN
PROBABLY HALF HIS AGE

18:13.483 --> 18:16.007
THAT'S LAUGHING
AT EVERY ONE OF HIS JOKES.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.402
AND YOU'RE STUCK HERE WITH THIS
GUY, REHEATING... BEEF SOUP?

18:19.402 --> 18:23.537
BEEF--BEEF BARLEY.
DO YOU MIND?SURE.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.757
WOULD YOU SAY
YOU HAVE FOOD ISSUES?

18:26.757 --> 18:29.760
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
WERE YOU AN ORPHAN?

18:29.760 --> 18:32.546
A LOT OF THIEVES AROUND HERE.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.505
OH, LIKE I'M GONNA STEAL
YOUR LUNCH.WELL, SOMEONE DID.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.986
YEAH, JUST THE OTHER DAY.
HOW LOW IS THAT?

18:37.986 --> 18:40.902
BEEF BARLEY?YEAH.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.512
BEEF--

18:42.512 --> 18:45.341
IT'S NOT REALLY
A POPULAR SOUP MEAT, IS IT?

18:45.341 --> 18:47.952
EACH HIS OWN.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.606
YEAH, I GUESS.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.566
[Van Pelt] SO HE KILLED HER
WHILE STEALING HIS OWN CAR?

18:52.566 --> 18:54.742
[Rigsby] THAT'S THE THEORY.
LOOK, GRACE,

18:54.742 --> 18:57.136
I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW
I'M NOT WORRIED

18:57.136 --> 19:00.095
ABOUT LISBON REPORTING US. WE'LL
MAKE IT WORK, WHATEVER HAPPENS.I KNOW WE WILL.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.141
IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE,

19:02.141 --> 19:05.187
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T TRANSFER
YOU OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.147
L.A. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS REALLY UNLIKELY.WELL, YOU'RE ASSUMING
I'M THE ONE TO BE TRANSFERRED?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.062
YEAH, I'VE BEEN HERE
ALMOST FIVE YEARS, SO SENIORITY,

19:11.062 --> 19:14.065
PLUS, THIS IS MY CAREER,
YOU KNOW?IT'S MY CAREER, TOO, WAYNE.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.242
NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.070
OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN HAVE
A CAREER AS WELL.THANKS FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

19:22.465 --> 19:25.555
WHY WOULD I STEAL
MY OWN CAR?OH, IT WAS YOUR WIFE'S CAR,
MR. LANDAU,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.992
YOUR, UH, ESTRANGED WIFE?

19:27.992 --> 19:31.213
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE UH--
WHAT DO YOU CALL--RECONCILING.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.954
OH? CONGRATULATIONS.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.608
THAT'S NICE.

19:34.608 --> 19:38.699
SO THE TRIP TO VEGAS
WAS A LAST HURRAH?

19:38.699 --> 19:42.398
YES, WE KNOW ABOUT IT.
WE KNOW EVERYTHING, MR. LANDAU.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.314
LISELLE DOUGLAS SOLD YOUR WIFE
THAT CAR. YOU KNOW HER?

19:45.314 --> 19:48.404
REALLY?
LISELLE SOLD METHAT CAR.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.407
'86 TESTAROSSA--
FRICKIN' CLASSIC.

19:51.407 --> 19:54.802
YOU THINK ALEXA EVEN CARED?
SHE CAN'T EVEN DRIVE STICK.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.413
SO YOU TOOK WHAT WAS YOURS.
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.110
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:59.110 --> 20:02.026
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.YOU KILLED HER, DIDN'T YOU?

20:02.026 --> 20:06.248
RAN LISELLE DOWN WHEN SHE
CAUGHT YOU TAKING THE CAR.WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.599
THAT'S HOW SHE DIED?WELL, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEE HER
UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE.

20:09.599 --> 20:13.603
IT WAS DARK. HELP YOURSELF,
MR. LANDAU. TELL US YOUR SIDE.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.518
[whispers] WOW.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.346
[normal voice] OH, MAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.436
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. LOOK...

20:20.436 --> 20:24.005
[sighs] WHEN I GOT BACK
FROM VEGAS,

20:24.005 --> 20:25.398
I, UH,

20:25.398 --> 20:29.967
I-I FORGOT SOME, UH,
STUFF IN MY CAR.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.404
DRUGS?

20:31.404 --> 20:34.145
NO. YEAH, DRUGS. WHAT ELSE?

20:34.145 --> 20:36.583
ALEXA AND I--

20:36.583 --> 20:38.802
WE'RE WORKING OUT
CUSTODY OF OUR SON.

20:38.802 --> 20:43.111
SO YOU COULD SEE HOW A DRUG BUST
COULD LOOK BAD.WELL, A PLACE LIKE ZENITH

20:43.111 --> 20:47.463
WOULD NEVER CALL THE POLICE
ON A CLIENT.OF COURSE NOT. THEY'D POLITELY
LEAVE IT IN THE GLOVE BOX,

20:47.463 --> 20:50.466
WHERE ALEXA WOULD FIND IT
AND HAVE ME THROWN IN PRISON.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.295
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET THE CAR
BEFORE SHE FOUND THE DOPE.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.442

21:13.272 --> 21:16.318
JUMPED AT THE CHANCE
TO GET CLOSE TO ME, SO I WAS...

21:18.538 --> 21:22.542

AWAY FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS

23:15.437 --> 23:18.788
IN ONE PIECE.THAT'S BLOOD ON THE AIR BAG.
HE WAS IN IT, ALL RIGHT.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.442

YOU WANT THEM TO.

24:32.209 --> 24:35.125

YOU THINK I DIDN'T
CHECK YOU OUT?

25:16.253 --> 25:17.907
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

25:17.907 --> 25:19.909
PSYCHIC,
JUST AS I CALLED IT.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.911
AH, NO SUCH THING
AS PSYCHICS.

25:21.911 --> 25:25.045
OH, I KNOW. YOU'RE A CHARLATAN,
AS I SAID.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.395
YOU LOST YOUR WIFE AND KID
TO A SERIAL KILLER--

25:27.395 --> 25:29.049
YOUR FAULT, YOU THINK--

25:29.049 --> 25:31.704
AND NOW YOU'RE ON THIS
HOPELESS QUEST FOR REDEMPTION,

25:31.704 --> 25:33.967
BATTLING EVIL AND INJUSTICE,
RIGHT?

25:33.967 --> 25:36.230
[clicks tongue]
CLOSE ENOUGH.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.233
YOU PLAY MIND GAMES WITH PEOPLE,
YOU SIZE UP THEIR WEAKNESSES

25:39.233 --> 25:42.715
AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM THE ROPE
TO HANG THEMSELVES.OH, YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO COOL.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.065
AND AS FOR YOUR WORK
SO FAR ON ME,

25:45.065 --> 25:46.806
I GUESS YOU THINK

25:46.806 --> 25:49.286
I'M VAIN, EGOTISTICAL
AND HATE BEING IGNORED.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.680
DO YOU DISAGREE?

25:51.680 --> 25:54.117
NO.
IT'S PRETTY MUCH ACCURATE.HUH.

25:54.117 --> 25:59.340
BUT I'M ALSO CUNNING, RUTHLESS,
AND I HATE TO LOSE.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.735
JUST THE KIND OF MAN THAT WOULD
KILL A WOMAN FOR REJECTING HIM.

26:02.735 --> 26:06.129
DID I?WELL, YOU KNEW LISELLE WAS
STUFFED IN THE TRUNK. HOW?

26:06.129 --> 26:08.436

I'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH. I JUST
NEED TO READ YOU A LITTLE MORE,

26:16.444 --> 26:20.535
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO
YOUR PSYCHE, IF YOU DON'T MIND.NOT AT ALL. DIG AWAY.
IT'LL BE FUN.

I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.851
YOU'RE DECIDING
HOW MY CAREER SHOULD GO?

27:15.851 --> 27:18.245
PLANNING MY ENTIRE LIFE
FOR ME?

27:18.245 --> 27:20.421
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE MARRIED
OR ANYTHING.

27:20.421 --> 27:23.250
GRACE, I GET IT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.427
HOW STUPID WOULD THAT BE,
RIGHT?

27:26.427 --> 27:30.779
STUPID?YEAH, UM, WE'VE ONLY BEEN
DATING A COUPLE MONTHS.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.913

27:36.829 --> 27:39.135
I MEAN, LONG-TERM,
WHERE ARE WE?

27:39.135 --> 27:42.486
DO WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS
RIGHT NOW?YEAH, WE PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT

27:42.486 --> 27:44.575
BEFORE WE ANNOUNCED
OUR RELATIONSHIP

27:44.575 --> 27:48.318
AND I ENDANGERED MY JOB.WELL,
MY JOB'S ON THE LINE, TOO.

27:48.318 --> 27:51.278
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE.
YOU HAVE SENIORITY, REMEMBER?LOOK, GRACE,
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,

27:51.278 --> 27:54.411
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP BLOWING
HOT AND COLD ON ME LIKE THIS,

27:54.411 --> 27:57.676

TO THE FRESNO OFFICE

27:57.676 --> 28:01.680
AND SMILE ABOUT IT?YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, GRACE.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.379

28:10.253 --> 28:13.430
JEFF, WE'VE GOT THE LAB
RUSHING THE RESULTS

28:13.430 --> 28:16.869
ON THE D.N.A. TEST
ON THE BUMPER OF THE FERRARI.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.828
ONCE WE FIND LISELLE'S BLOOD,
ANY LEVERAGE YOU HAD IS GONE.

28:19.828 --> 28:23.049
YOU SHOULD PLEAD THIS OUT NOW.YOU THINK I KILLED HER?

28:23.049 --> 28:25.965
IT HELPS THAT YOU SAID SO
DURING THE STANDOFF.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.619
RIGHT.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.143
WHAT'S WEIRD...

28:30.143 --> 28:32.841
I THINK
IF I HAD KILLED HER,

28:32.841 --> 28:37.237
I'D FEEL BETTER THAN I DO NOW.
AT LEAST I'D FEEL IN CONTROL.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.021
SO NOW YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DIDN'T DO IT?

28:39.021 --> 28:41.154
I DIDN'T.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.764
BUT I DID...

28:42.764 --> 28:45.071
METAPHORICALLY.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.160
I KILLED HER
WITH MY SELFISHNESS.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.423
THIS ISN'T A LYRIC-WRITING
WORKSHOP, JEFF.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.860
YOU WERE THERE
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

28:51.860 --> 28:56.256
YOU STOLE THE CAR AT LANDAU'S
REQUEST AND STASHED IT WHERE?

28:56.256 --> 28:58.040
PARKING GARAGE?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.738
[whispers] YEAH.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.741
[normal voice] I THOUGHT, UH,
IF THIS GUY GIVES ME A BREAK,

29:02.741 --> 29:06.179
I CAN FINALLY MAKE IT,
TAKE CARE OF LISELLE FOR ONCE.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.616
[scoffs]

29:08.616 --> 29:11.575
SHE TAKES CARE OF ME
BY WORKING HER ASS OFF.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.839
MY BIG IDEA WAS
GRAND THEFT AUTO.

29:13.839 --> 29:17.190
MAYBE LISELLE CAUGHT YOU,
TRIED TO STOP YOU.NO.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.105
MAYBE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.802
NO.

29:20.802 --> 29:24.240
SHE W--SHE NEVER EVEN SAW ME.
SHE WAS WORKING TOO HARD.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.421
[voice breaking] I LOVED HER.

29:31.421 --> 29:33.423
IF I HAD KILLED HER,

29:33.423 --> 29:36.600
YOU WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO ME,
'CAUSE I'D BE DEAD, TOO.

29:40.300 --> 29:44.173

ALL ACTION AND REACTION,

29:56.969 --> 29:58.884
NO SUBTLETY.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.930
YOU CANNOT TRAIN IT
TO NOT REACT.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.628
THEN WHERE DID
I HIDE THE RING?YOU'RE TELLING ME.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.239
[laughs]

30:06.239 --> 30:08.850
ALL THE LIZARD BRAIN KNOWS
IS THAT SOMETHING IS HIDDEN

30:08.850 --> 30:13.202
AND YOU DON'T WANT IT FOUND.
YOU CAN'T HIDE YOUR REACTION.

30:13.202 --> 30:16.510
YOU'RE TALKING A GOOD GAME,
BUT I DON'T SEE MY RING.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.208

30:52.111 --> 30:54.896
IT'S QUACKERY.
YOU--YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.117
YOU THINK YOU SWEAT TOO MUCH,
YOU HAVE MILD DIRT PHOBIA,

30:58.117 --> 31:00.380

AHH! THAT WAS FUN.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.920
WHOO! [whistles]

32:45.920 --> 32:49.097
THANK YOU. VOILà.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.056
HUH? ALL IN THE WRIST.[Walter laughs]

32:51.056 --> 32:52.840
[crowd shouts indistinctly]

32:52.840 --> 32:54.320

32:54.320 --> 32:56.235
AAH! OHH!

[seagulls calling]

33:12.860 --> 33:15.776
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.517
IT WAS A TOTAL ACCIDENT.

33:17.517 --> 33:21.695
AH.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.566
WELL, UH...

33:23.566 --> 33:25.655
AT LEAST NO ONE GOT HURT.

33:25.655 --> 33:26.961
[sniffles]

33:28.832 --> 33:31.400
IT WAS A TERRIBLE COLOR,
ANYWAY.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.925
I-I'LL GET YOU A NEW ONE.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.231
SORRY.

33:47.329 --> 33:50.332
NO TRACES OF BLOOD OR D.N.A.
ON THE STOLEN CAR.

33:50.332 --> 33:53.335
NOTHING?
SO WE HAVE NO MURDER WEAPON.AND NO SUSPECTS.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.295
LET'S START OVER. GO THROUGH
EVERY WITNESS STATEMENT.[cell phone rings]

33:56.295 --> 33:58.949
EXCUSE ME. HEY, CHO.

33:58.949 --> 34:01.082
OH, NO.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.084
OH, GREAT.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.043
NO. NO,
YOU CAN HANDLE THIS ONE.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.002
JUST BE SURE TO BE CLEAR
THAT THE CBI IS NOT LIABLE.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.396
HE IS JUST A CONSULTANT.

34:13.094 --> 34:15.227
UH, LONG STORY.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.316
UH, I HAVE TO BUY WALTER
A NEW CAR.

34:17.316 --> 34:19.361
COULD YOU SHOW US
WHAT YOU HAVE?

34:19.361 --> 34:22.799
AS I EXPLAINED, MR. JANE,
WE NEED A BANK STATEMENT

34:22.799 --> 34:25.889
TO CONFIRM--MR. JANE HAS ASSURED ME ON HIS
HONOR THAT HE'S GOOD FOR IT.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.153
SO I'LL VOUCH FOR HIM.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.894
DO YOU NEED TO SEE
MYBANK STATEMENT?[laughs] OF COURSE NOT.

34:30.894 --> 34:33.549
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THEN LET'S DO THIS.ABSOLUTELY.

34:33.549 --> 34:36.683
I THINK WE'LL HAVE ELIAS
SHOW US AROUND.BUT YOU WANT THE BEST
TO HELP SHOW YOU AROUND.

34:36.683 --> 34:40.991
YES, HE'S SECOND BEST.
HE'LL TRY HARDER.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.255
RIGHT?RIGHT.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.126
SHALL WE?

34:50.871 --> 34:54.179
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HERE?EXCELLENT EYE. THIS CAR--

34:54.179 --> 34:58.487
WELL, IT'S GRAY.
I MEAN, REALLY? GRAY?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.489
YOUR CAR.

35:00.489 --> 35:01.882
MM.

35:01.882 --> 35:04.014
NO.

35:04.014 --> 35:08.106
GRAY'D BE COMPLETELY WRONG,
WOULDN'T IT?

35:08.106 --> 35:11.457
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE, UH...

35:11.457 --> 35:13.981
ACTUALLY, NO.
LET'S GO THIS WAY. SHALL WE?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.510
PATRICK, WE'VE BEEN THIS WAY
BEFORE. LET'S GO BACK.

35:21.510 --> 35:24.122
OH, PLEASE. BE PATIENT.
SEE, THE THING IS, WALTER,

35:24.122 --> 35:26.254
NO MATTER HOW SMART A PLAN
YOU MAKE,

35:26.254 --> 35:29.257
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE SMARTER
WHO WILL SEE THROUGH IT--

35:29.257 --> 35:31.825
MAKES IT VERY HARD
TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.137
I LIKE THIS CAR SHOPPING.
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.671
I THINK THAT'S YOUR CAR.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.673
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHO?

35:53.673 --> 35:55.892
6-SPEED, PEDAL SHIFTERS.
NICE.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.329
OH, YEAH. MM!

35:57.329 --> 35:59.418
EH. IT'S OKAY, I SUPPOSE.

35:59.418 --> 36:02.116
TRY IT.
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.510
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.MR. MASHBURN,
MAY I SUGGEST--

36:04.510 --> 36:07.252
THIS CAR--IT'S...
A LITTLE GAUCHE FOR YOU.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.950
DID YOU SEE HIS LAST CAR?

36:09.950 --> 36:12.082
THIS IS A LOT BETTER COLOR.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.128
THIS COLOR SYMBOLIZES
PASSION, LUST, ANGER.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.912
I THINK IT'S LOVELY.

36:15.912 --> 36:19.960
IT DOES HAVE A LITTLE DING
DOWN HERE.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.833
I'M SURE THEY CAN FIX THAT,
RIGHT, ELIAS?

36:23.833 --> 36:27.402
IT'S A REALLY NICE CAR, BUT IT'S
HAD SOME TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.318
I SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK
AT THE LAMBORGHINI MURCIéLAGO.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.972
V-12,

36:31.972 --> 36:35.105
631 HORSEPOWER--MUCH NICER
THAN THE ONE YOU HAD BEFORE.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.846
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:36.846 --> 36:39.849
MAYBE--MAYBE WE LEFT THE FIRST
FLOOR A LITTLE TOO SOON.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.765
THERE WERE SOME REALLY CHOICE
CARS UPSTAIRS.

36:44.680 --> 36:48.684
BUT, OF COURSE, IF THIS IS
THE CAR YOU LIKE, NO PROBLEM.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.382
OF COURSE. [chuckles]

36:50.382 --> 36:53.776
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S A MATTER
OF OPINION. I...

36:56.083 --> 36:59.782
YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?I'M FINE, YES.
THAT'S--I'M FINE.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.567
HE'S NOT FINE.

37:01.567 --> 37:04.222
HE'S FEELING SQUEAMISH
'CAUSE THIS IS THE CAR

37:04.222 --> 37:06.267
THAT HE USED TO KILL LISELLE.I'M SORRY. WHAT?

37:06.267 --> 37:08.617
YOU LED US RIGHT TO IT.I DID NOT.

37:08.617 --> 37:11.098
YES, YOU DID.
YOU LED US RIGHT TO IT,

37:11.098 --> 37:15.233
AND HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
IF YOU DIDN'T KILL HER?[laughs] THAT'S THE MOST--

37:15.233 --> 37:17.147
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS...

37:18.975 --> 37:22.457
THIS CAR WAS THE HIDDEN RING,
WASN'T IT?YEP.

37:22.457 --> 37:25.721
AND YOU READ ELIAS' LIZARD BRAIN
TO FIGURE OUT--YEAH.

37:37.603 --> 37:40.693
[handcuffs click]

37:40.693 --> 37:42.260
SO IT'S OVER.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.957
YEAH, IT'S OVER.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.438
THAT'S TOO BAD.
IT WAS FUN.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.136
YEAH. HOW YOU GONNA TOP
THAT THRILL?

37:49.136 --> 37:51.747
MAYBE NEXT TIME
I'LL BE THE KILLER.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.012
IT'S THE COMPETITION.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.363
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
IT EATS AT YOU.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.540
SECOND PLACE--FIRST LOSER.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.498
KINSEY WAS WINNING
ANOTHER SALES DRIVE.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.457
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.415
WESTHOFF LIKES HUSTLE,
SO YOU HUSTLED.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.244
AND YOU MADE KINSEY SICK

38:10.244 --> 38:12.246
BY POISONING
HIS BEEF BARLEY SOUP.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.901
ONLY LISELLE CAUGHT YOU
AT IT, DIDN'T SHE?

38:25.477 --> 38:27.479
KINSEY HAD BEEN SICK
FOR A WHILE.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.785
SHE FIGURED IT OUT,
GOT MAD.

38:29.785 --> 38:32.788
SHE THREW AWAY THE SOUP
AND SAID THAT I HAD TO TELL

38:32.788 --> 38:35.748
WESTHOFF WHAT I HAD DONE, TOLD
ME I HAD TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

38:35.748 --> 38:38.272
"MAKE THIS RIGHT"--
WHO SAYS THAT?

38:38.272 --> 38:41.971
SELF-RIGHTEOUS BITCH.

38:41.971 --> 38:45.758
WESTHOFF FINDS OUT I WAS
TAKING OUT HIS TOP EARNER,

38:45.758 --> 38:48.674
HE'D MAKE SURE
I'D NEVER WORK AGAIN.

38:48.674 --> 38:52.504
AND KINSEY? THAT SON OF A BITCH WOULD CALL THE COPS FOR SURE.[tires peal]

38:54.375 --> 38:55.898
[thump]

38:55.898 --> 38:57.900
SECURITY SHOWED UP
SOONER THAN I THOUGHT,

38:57.900 --> 38:59.946
SO I STUFFED THE BODY
IN THE TRUNK.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.557
IT WAS ME OR HER.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.603
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

39:04.603 --> 39:07.606
SOMEONE GIVES YOU THAT CHOICE,
YOU CHOOSE YOU EVERY TIME.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.957
I'M SURE A JURY
WILL SYMPATHIZE.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.133
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

39:13.133 --> 39:15.527
LIKE I SAID,
YOU'RE NUMBER TWO.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.920
NUMBER TWO
ALWAYS TRIES HARDER.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.750
THAT, AND NOBODY STEALS

THEY, UH, TOLD ME
THEY'RE NOT PRESSING CHARGES,

39:30.150 --> 39:32.152
SAID I HAVE YOU TO THANK.

39:32.152 --> 39:35.938
SO, UH, YOU KNOW, THANKS.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.114
JUST DON'T SCREW IT UP,
JEFF.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.173
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.045
EXCUSE ME?THAT YOU'RE TOGETHER.
YOU DIDN'T SAY IT.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.047
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

39:58.047 --> 40:00.310
THERE ARE NO RULES BEING BROKEN
THAT I'M AWARE OF--

40:00.310 --> 40:03.966
NO HOLDING HANDS,
NO SOULFUL LOOKS

40:03.966 --> 40:06.795
AND ABSOLUTELY NO KISSING
IN THE OFFICE.NO PROBLEM.

40:06.795 --> 40:07.970
FINE.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.433

YOU WRECKED HIS CAR

JUST TO GET A CLEAN READ
ON ELIAS?IS THAT WHAT I DID?

40:38.087 --> 40:41.308
YEAH, YOU DID.
MASHBURN'S NOT MAD?NO. WE GAVE HIM
A NEW EXPERIENCE.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.180
HE HELPED US
CATCH THE KILLER.

40:44.180 --> 40:48.358
THIS IS HIS WAY OF SAYING
THANK YOU. GET IN.WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ACCEPT GIFTS FROM PEOPLE.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.360
IT'S NOT A GIFT.
IT'S A LEND.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.015
NOW I KNOW THIS FANTASTIC
RESTAURANT IN NAPA.

40:53.015 --> 40:56.628

SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES.
