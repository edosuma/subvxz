00:01.710 --> 00:02.625
What is up, guys? I'm Paige.

00:02.661 --> 00:04.218
I'm Frankie.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.021
Both: And we are Bizaardvark.

00:06.056 --> 00:09.091
Every day, millions
of children across the world

00:09.126 --> 00:12.319
suffer from a shortage...
of dance moves.

00:12.354 --> 00:14.212
But this tragedy
can be eradicated

00:14.248 --> 00:16.373
with the help of our new video,

00:16.408 --> 00:17.841
"Anything Can Be a Dance."

00:20.304 --> 00:21.439
- Nailed it!
- We are so good at being fake-sad!

00:21.463 --> 00:23.797
Yeah!

00:23.833 --> 00:24.689

00:24.724 --> 00:25.724
It's gonna be so great!

Oh, man I just had
the most epic game

03:33.855 --> 03:35.914
of arcade basketball ever!

03:35.949 --> 03:37.810
- What happened?
- I walked up to the machine and some idiot

03:37.834 --> 03:39.901
left behind 20 tickets!

03:39.937 --> 03:41.294
Add it to the pile!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.153
You truly are the eighth wonder
of the world,

03:47.177 --> 03:48.177
Mount Ticket-Manjaro.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.488
Someday, we'll have
enough tickets to redeem you

03:52.524 --> 03:54.974
for a life-size fighting robot.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.185
Hey, I thought we agreed

03:57.220 --> 03:58.372
we were saving to get
a flat screen TV for our studio?

03:58.396 --> 03:59.746
I never agreed to that,

03:59.782 --> 04:01.356
and we will continue
this conversation

04:01.391 --> 04:03.071
once I have a fighting robot
to back me up.

04:04.919 --> 04:07.487
Well, right now we need
a new video.

04:07.523 --> 04:09.581
How about "Spacey Space Cadets"?

04:09.616 --> 04:12.617
Two astronauts who can't focus.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.955
(makes radio static noise) That's one small
step for... Dude, aren't hands crazy?

04:18.566 --> 04:20.725
Interesting. No.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.204
Okay, um... what about a video

04:24.239 --> 04:26.598
about an easily
intrigued armadillo?

04:26.633 --> 04:29.626
It's called "Armadill... Ohh!"

04:29.661 --> 04:31.094
Funny.

04:31.129 --> 04:34.447
No.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.042
Then, how about a video about a
girl who says "no" to everything?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.977
No. Although that girl
does sound awesome.

04:41.256 --> 04:42.989
It's you.
You say "no" all the time.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.215
No, I don't.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.567
No! No!

04:45.602 --> 04:46.742
No!

04:46.778 --> 04:48.136
No!

04:48.171 --> 04:50.972
And that was just
five minutes ago!

04:51.007 --> 04:53.057
- May I rebut?
- You may.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.010
You say "yes" to everything.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.303
I can help!

04:56.338 --> 04:58.288
I'll do it!

04:58.323 --> 05:01.158
I don't know what you
just said, but yes!

05:01.193 --> 05:02.959
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

05:06.515 --> 05:09.883
Fine... but I just think
saying "no" all the time

05:09.918 --> 05:12.844
closes you off to things
that you might actually like.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.265
Which is why
I've proposed a bet.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.460
Dirk's voice: Bet bet bet bet bet!
It's time for a bet!

05:20.645 --> 05:23.245
Everybody asked if we would
ever use the bet button.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.441
- I said "no."
- I said "yes."

05:25.918 --> 05:27.734
So what's the bet?

05:27.769 --> 05:30.236
I bet I can go longer
saying "no" to things

05:30.272 --> 05:31.955
than you can go saying "yes."

05:31.990 --> 05:34.665
You're on. How about, if I win,

05:34.701 --> 05:37.093
I can use "Mount Ticket-Manjaro"
to get my fighting robot?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.745
If you win,
you can get the flat screen.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.663
Pfft. Forget the TV.
If we're betting,

05:40.698 --> 05:45.243
I'm getting something for me
that's totally practical.

05:45.279 --> 05:47.319
Like that five-foot-tall
adorable stuffed sea otter!

05:49.174 --> 05:51.424
- Great! It's a bet!
- Great.

05:51.459 --> 05:53.602
By the way, what does
that other button do?

05:53.637 --> 05:55.077
I don't know.
We've never pressed it.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.876
Dirk's voice: It's a rhino attack!
Rhino attack!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.167
Run for your life!

06:01.202 --> 06:02.894
I think this
was a solid purchase.

06:05.941 --> 06:09.208
All right, Dareheads! I'm
gonna juggle these chainsaws,

06:09.244 --> 06:13.137
while riding this skateboard, which I'm
gonna backflip off of, onto a moving train,

06:13.172 --> 06:15.148
- as flames...
- (fart sound)

06:15.183 --> 06:16.641
(chainsaws hitting floor)

06:16.677 --> 06:18.985
Did you get that?

06:19.021 --> 06:22.672
Please tell me you got that...
'cause I just farted!

06:22.708 --> 06:24.265
(both laugh)

06:24.301 --> 06:26.409
What are you two dopes
laughing at?

06:26.445 --> 06:27.997
We're watching my "Dare
Me Bro" outtakes.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.379
Outtakes?

06:29.414 --> 06:32.823
Yeah, like when you make a mistake
when you're filming a video.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.701
Mistake?

06:35.737 --> 06:38.822
Yeah, like when you intend to do
something, but it goes horribly wrong?

06:38.857 --> 06:41.316
Something?

06:41.351 --> 06:43.493
You really don't know
what an outtake is?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.928
Bernie, just show her.

06:45.964 --> 06:48.097
Me? Why would you ask me?
I'm offended...

06:48.132 --> 06:49.607
- (smash)
- Oh...

06:52.070 --> 06:56.172
Ohhh! I get it now.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.042
You have made a mistake
on camera, haven't you?

06:59.077 --> 07:01.403
Well, there was that time
I said "fuchsia"

07:01.438 --> 07:05.123
but it sounded
more like "fuuchsia."

07:05.158 --> 07:09.085
No one's ever seen it.
And no one ever will.

07:11.414 --> 07:14.565
I'm sorry, that kinda thing,
never happens.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.551
Uhp, my foot's in a mop bucket.

07:18.914 --> 07:22.090
Look, I gotta tell you.
My Dareheads love outtakes.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.416
I put them on my channel

07:23.451 --> 07:25.501
and gain a ton
of new subscribers.

07:25.536 --> 07:29.205
Wow. Maybe I should
try outtakes, too.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.274
I don't even know
how this happened!

07:35.647 --> 07:39.791
Students of Sierra High,
as president of the Drama Club...

07:39.826 --> 07:41.220
Rachel, everyone knows
if there's a club,

07:41.244 --> 07:42.894
you're president of it.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.538
And one day,
America will be my club.

07:47.692 --> 07:50.669
The Drama Club
needs new thespians.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.446
This year, all of our plays will
center around the theme, suffering.

07:53.481 --> 07:56.799
Lots of deep,
emotional discovery.

07:56.835 --> 07:59.911
So, can I count you in?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.831
Yeah, I appreciate the offer, Rachel,
but my answer is a big, fat n...

08:02.866 --> 08:05.717
- A big, fat what, Frankie?
- A big, fat n'yes.

08:05.752 --> 08:06.752
N'yay!

08:08.238 --> 08:12.315
Frankie! I need a huge favor.

08:12.351 --> 08:13.992
Can you please
babysit my cactus?

08:14.027 --> 08:17.095
- Uh... yeah.
- Thanks!

08:17.130 --> 08:19.564
You be a good boy?
You better be a good boy!

08:19.599 --> 08:22.283
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

08:22.319 --> 08:24.861
Sweet!
Off to the Wagon Convention!

08:24.896 --> 08:26.996
Wheee!

08:27.031 --> 08:32.151
Attention, students! The Chess
Club is looking for a volunteer

08:32.187 --> 08:33.936
to be our mascot.

08:33.971 --> 08:38.032
The matches are long, and the
costume is uncomfortable,

08:38.067 --> 08:40.043
but it's for the good
of the school.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.427
What do you say, Frankie?

08:43.632 --> 08:44.973
Yeeeeeeeesss!

08:48.319 --> 08:52.722
Ughh! Today's been the worst!
I can only imagine saying "no"

08:52.757 --> 08:55.082
has been
a total nightmare for you.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.009
What do you say we just
call this whole bet off?

08:57.045 --> 08:58.278
No way!

09:00.198 --> 09:05.001
I thought I'd hate this, but it
turns out I love to say "no."

09:05.036 --> 09:07.387
It's been so liberating
and relaxing.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.297
You do seem relaxed.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.667
And... And that drink looks
refreshing, can I have a sip?

09:12.702 --> 09:13.702
- No.
- (gasps)

09:15.788 --> 09:17.541
Who are you, and what
have you done to my weak,

09:17.565 --> 09:18.756
people-pleasing best friend?

09:21.403 --> 09:24.721
Frankie, for once in my life
I... I'm putting myself first.

09:24.756 --> 09:29.400
I took a nap today, like a
carefree cat on a window sill.

09:29.435 --> 09:33.563
Me... (loud slurping)

09:33.598 --> 09:37.975
yow.

09:38.010 --> 09:42.121
If I had any blood left in my
arms, I'd take a swing at you.

09:42.157 --> 09:45.141
Ahhh... can't wait to win the bet
and pick up my new stuffed friend,

09:45.177 --> 09:47.235
Ollie Sea Otterman.

09:47.270 --> 09:50.429
That's right, I named him!

09:50.465 --> 09:54.084
Don't you just love that name?

09:54.119 --> 09:56.878
(loud slurping)

09:56.913 --> 09:58.129
Yes.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.497
- Hey, guys, she's Paige.
- And she's Frankie.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.581
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.871
And today, we're doing

10:06.906 --> 10:08.431
the Sick Smoothie Challenge.

10:08.466 --> 10:10.111
Some of these bags
have gross stuff in them,

10:10.135 --> 10:11.175
and some of them

10:11.210 --> 10:12.534
have yummy stuff.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.310
We're each gonna pick five bags,

10:13.346 --> 10:14.429
and then make a smoothie

10:14.464 --> 10:15.464
with whatever ingredients

10:15.499 --> 10:16.747
we're stuck with.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.785
Then we're gonna blend it all up

10:17.809 --> 10:19.066
and drink, drink, drink.

10:19.102 --> 10:19.900
- Or puke, puke, puke!
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.936 --> 10:20.759
- Ready?
- I'm ready!

10:20.795 --> 10:23.171
All right.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.350
- Let's make our first picks
- You go first... you go first.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.181
Number nine... strawberries!

10:25.217 --> 10:26.015
Sploosh! Your turn!

10:26.051 --> 10:27.516
All right.

10:27.551 --> 10:29.118
- Asparagus!
- Ohhh! Oooh!

10:29.153 --> 10:30.753
Aww!

10:30.788 --> 10:32.080
- What is it?
- It's horseradish.

10:32.115 --> 10:35.850
Ohhhh-haha-haha!

10:35.886 --> 10:38.235
Oh, that's gonna be
a great smoothie right there!

10:38.271 --> 10:40.471
Oh god!

10:40.506 --> 10:42.273
- Honey!
- Ohhhhhhh!

10:42.308 --> 10:45.451
(laughs) Blue cheese!

10:45.486 --> 10:46.939
- I'm not... I'm not eatin' that.
- (laughs)

10:46.963 --> 10:49.514
- Cheese balls.
- Ugh!

10:49.549 --> 10:51.052
- (coughing)
- Oh, that's a lotta cheeseballs.

10:51.076 --> 10:52.567
(laughs)

10:52.602 --> 10:55.586
- A banana! A banana.
- Okay.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.050
- Like strawberry, banana, apple, horseradish...
- Yeah, and blue cheese.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.031
- Blue cheese.
- All right.

10:59.066 --> 11:01.301
- Gummy worms!
- Awww!

11:01.336 --> 11:02.947
- I actually like those, can I have one?
- No.

11:02.971 --> 11:04.454
- Are you kidding me?
- What is it?

11:04.489 --> 11:06.138
- I got clam juice.
- (laughs)

11:06.174 --> 11:08.299
(laughs)

11:08.334 --> 11:09.726
Lemme s...

11:09.761 --> 11:14.155
- All of it, all of it, all of it!
- No! That's too much!

11:14.190 --> 11:16.824
- Is this radishes?
- I'm mad at you!

11:16.860 --> 11:19.827
- (blenders running)
- Ohh, it looks so bad!

11:19.862 --> 11:21.170
Ohhhhh!

11:22.823 --> 11:25.350
Ohhhhh!

11:25.427 --> 11:26.662
Yours just smells like
strawberries and bananas.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.927
Ohh, how disgusting.

11:30.582 --> 11:32.031
- (disgusted noises)
- (spitting)

11:32.066 --> 11:33.524
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

11:33.560 --> 11:35.201
(screaming)

11:35.236 --> 11:36.352
(laughing)

11:36.387 --> 11:37.078
Oh! It's so bad!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.805
It's salty!

11:38.840 --> 11:41.006
(gagging noise)

11:41.042 --> 11:43.167
Ah-haww!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.944
(screams)

11:44.979 --> 11:46.746
Aaaaah! (Laughs)

11:46.782 --> 11:50.116
(screaming)

11:50.151 --> 11:52.485
- The gummy worm stayed alive!
- (laughs)

11:52.520 --> 11:53.828
It's alive! It's alive!

11:55.431 --> 11:56.431
Male voice: Bizaardvark!

11:59.418 --> 12:01.335
- Hey, Paige!
- Hey.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.615
There's a "Save the Sea Otters"
event this afternoon.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.949
- Hm.
- Wanna come volunteer with me?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.132
Really? Wow, I... I would love...

12:08.278 --> 12:11.845
To say no.

12:11.881 --> 12:15.358
But, the sea otters' habitats are being
encroached upon by giant corporations.

12:15.393 --> 12:17.644
If no one takes action,
they could die.

12:17.679 --> 12:18.686
Don't you care?

12:20.098 --> 12:21.105
No.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.948
Ow!

12:22.984 --> 12:24.559
I'm so sorry!

12:24.594 --> 12:26.777
Aah! I think it's sprained.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.452
Can you help me
get to the nurse's office?

12:29.658 --> 12:30.658
No!

12:32.293 --> 12:35.828
Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:38.575 --> 12:40.557
Paige. This is Gaby.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.969
She spent 18 hours flying here

12:43.046 --> 12:46.339
from Fiji because she's
a huge Bizaardvark fan.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.974
Can you sing a song
for cute little Gaby?

12:49.235 --> 12:50.259
Please?

12:52.296 --> 12:55.648
No!

12:55.684 --> 12:58.793
But Bizaardvark is the only
thing that makes me happy.

12:58.828 --> 13:01.554
Can you at least tell me
that life gets easier,

13:01.589 --> 13:02.980
and I won't wake up sad
every day?

13:04.225 --> 13:05.225
No!

13:09.530 --> 13:12.273
All right, fork over the green.

13:12.309 --> 13:14.858
I thought for sure Paige
would cave and say "yes."

13:14.894 --> 13:16.130
Well, thanks for helping me
with the Gaby bit.

13:16.154 --> 13:18.862
I almost didn't need it after
that Rachel thing, that was nuts.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.816
Hey, I did my part.
Can you pay me in hundies?

13:21.851 --> 13:22.861
I'm only paying
you five dollars.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.043
Coo, coo.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.733
Can you pay me
in two two's and a one-y?

13:27.757 --> 13:29.317
- Do you want this or not?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:30.793 --> 13:32.935
Hey, don't forget.
Half of that's for Gaby.

13:32.971 --> 13:34.011
Agh.

13:38.927 --> 13:44.363
Oh, Frankie. If you're gonna play dirty...
I'm gonna play dirty, too.

13:44.399 --> 13:47.675
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
Frankie's not paying us.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.468
She said you didn't
sell it enough.

13:49.504 --> 13:50.820
Her words, not mine.

13:55.718 --> 13:57.618
Well, you two were wrong,
as usual.

14:00.773 --> 14:04.158
Can you be more specific?

14:04.193 --> 14:09.047
I posted some hilarious outtakes on my
channel, and they're not getting any views.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.082
Look.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.866
Oh my... I only baked these
with five-eighths of a teaspoon

14:20.902 --> 14:22.760
of vanilla...
instead of six-eighths!

14:22.795 --> 14:25.021
Haa!
What an embarrassing mistake!

14:27.892 --> 14:32.220
Amelia here with tips
on how to organize your closet.

14:32.255 --> 14:34.822
First, take your shoes
and put them on hangers.

14:38.185 --> 14:40.186
(laughs)

14:40.221 --> 14:43.789
Shoes on hangers... What?
Now that's an outtake!

14:46.702 --> 14:50.162
Amelia here,
wearing a light purple shirt,

14:50.197 --> 14:51.380
Whaaat?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.502
That should've gotten
a million views.

14:56.537 --> 14:58.679
Light purple
is so out right now.

15:01.217 --> 15:02.217
Agh.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.094
Gotta go dark purp, brah.

15:06.130 --> 15:10.174
But Amelia, outtakes
shouldn't be prepared.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.575
They should be spontaneous.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.344
Well, then I need help.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.197
Bernie, what's your secret?
You're basically a human outtake.

15:17.233 --> 15:20.167
What? I am not a human outtake.

15:20.203 --> 15:21.393
Hah!

15:21.429 --> 15:22.429
Ohhhhhh!

15:24.758 --> 15:27.083
Bernie:
I hate you, Acrobat Channellll!

15:32.807 --> 15:35.533
(to herself) All right,
Frankie, it's payback time.

15:35.568 --> 15:39.662
It's gonna take hard work, meticulous
planning, probably a lot of late nights...

15:39.697 --> 15:41.972
It's just been really hard
to fit in here, Mom.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.058
I wish I had a peer mentor
to show me around.

15:44.093 --> 15:46.060
(blowing nose)

15:49.749 --> 15:54.494
or, it will conveniently
fall in my lap.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.787
Hey! I hear you're looking
for a peer mentor?

15:56.822 --> 15:58.281
Hang on. Poppy seeds.

15:58.316 --> 15:59.316
Ooh.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.463
Uhh! Uh, uh!

16:06.499 --> 16:09.725
Ohh... got it!

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
(gagging)

16:13.372 --> 16:17.467
Anyway, I happen to know the
perfect peer mentor for you.

16:17.502 --> 16:18.742
Frankie Wong.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.062
Thanks.

16:21.097 --> 16:21.995
Oh... Hey, aren't you
forgetting something?

16:22.031 --> 16:23.139
Oh, yeah.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.823
Hey, I'm Marlene. I'm new
here and... (clears throat)

16:31.858 --> 16:33.641
lookin' for a peer mentor
for the year.

16:33.676 --> 16:35.584
Can you be mine?

16:35.619 --> 16:38.029
Uhhhhh...

16:43.719 --> 16:45.589
(to herself) Frankie's gonna
say "no" and then I'm gonna

16:45.613 --> 16:46.613
win the bet.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.340
Yes, I will be your peer mentor.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.667
Yay!

16:51.702 --> 16:53.127
Nooo!

16:57.116 --> 16:58.335
What's up, guys?
Bizaardvark here,

16:58.359 --> 17:00.459
with our friends
Bernie and Amelia.

17:00.494 --> 17:03.496
- Have you ever put on a shower cap...
- Bernie? We do the intros.

17:03.531 --> 17:05.665
Have you ever
put on a shower cap,

17:05.700 --> 17:07.711
put shaving cream on it, and
tossed cheeseballs at it?

17:07.735 --> 17:11.396
- No, I have not...
- Bernie... I'll do the responding.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.322
No, I have not!

17:13.399 --> 17:14.735
Well, you're in luck,
because today we are doing

17:14.759 --> 17:16.592
the Cheeseball Challenge.

17:16.627 --> 17:19.461
- Woo!
- Bernie? Bernie, please, we do the woos.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.532
Frankie/Paige/Amelia: Woooo!

17:20.556 --> 17:22.840
(slap)

17:22.875 --> 17:23.875
Frankie: Ahhhhhh!

17:25.987 --> 17:27.122
You look like
you have gray hair!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.787
Okay!

17:28.822 --> 17:30.998
It looks like marshmallows
melted on my face!

17:32.493 --> 17:33.951
Ooh!

17:33.986 --> 17:34.935
Amelia: Oh, I got one!

17:34.970 --> 17:36.245
Go, go go.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.396
Are you... Come on!

17:37.431 --> 17:38.431
Throw a ton!

17:41.227 --> 17:42.304
Frankie: Yeah, just
throw the whole bucket!

17:42.328 --> 17:45.153
- Ahhhh!
- We're geniuses!

17:45.189 --> 17:47.114
Paige: Okay, okay, let's count!

17:47.149 --> 17:49.458
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Amelia: One, two, three, four, five,

17:49.494 --> 17:50.642
six, seven, eight,

17:50.678 --> 17:51.994
Paige: Twenty-eight!

17:52.030 --> 17:52.645
- There's one right here.
- Twenty-nine.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.746
Girl, we got 29!

17:54.782 --> 17:56.974
Frankie/Amelia: 24, 25, 26...

17:57.009 --> 18:00.528
- 52, 53, 54, 55...
- What?

18:00.563 --> 18:01.945
(Amelia gasps)

18:01.981 --> 18:04.398
I wasn't done counting!

18:04.433 --> 18:05.875
Ahhhh!

18:05.910 --> 18:07.079
Amelia, this isn't our studio,

18:07.103 --> 18:09.378
- they have to clean this up. Bye!
- Bye!

18:09.414 --> 18:10.414
What are we...

18:12.399 --> 18:13.340
Bernie!

18:13.376 --> 18:14.376
G...

18:19.382 --> 18:20.840
My friends.

18:26.330 --> 18:27.980
Hey, peer mentor!

18:28.015 --> 18:30.199
Marlene?
What are you doing here?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.178
The peer mentor thing
is just during school hours.

18:32.202 --> 18:33.977
I was wonderin'
if you wanna hang out.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.312
So... you wanna hang out?

18:37.341 --> 18:41.610
Uhhhhhhhhhh...

18:43.956 --> 18:46.615
Yes, I would love to hang out.

18:46.650 --> 18:51.245
Whoa, speakin' of hangin' out,
what do we have here?

18:51.280 --> 18:53.638
Ohh!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.374
And that's going in the trash.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.853
So, Marlene, um, how long
do you think you're gonna be...

18:59.889 --> 19:02.089
Uh-oh... foot itch! Foot itch!

19:04.159 --> 19:05.159
- (gasps)
- Ohh!

19:07.613 --> 19:11.373
Ohh. Ooh!

19:11.408 --> 19:14.543
And a friend for the shirt.

19:14.578 --> 19:17.705
So, Marlene, um, Frankie and
I actually have some work

19:17.740 --> 19:19.122
we need to do, so...

19:19.158 --> 19:20.958
Cool, what are you guys
workin' on?

19:20.993 --> 19:21.942
(sneezes)

19:21.977 --> 19:22.977
Ohh!

19:38.060 --> 19:41.854
And that's another blunder-free
edition of "Perfect Perfection"

19:41.889 --> 19:46.792
with Amelia. Wait, I said
blunder instead of outtake!

19:46.827 --> 19:49.186
That's an outtake! Right?

19:49.222 --> 19:51.458
Actually, blunder and outtake
pretty much mean the same thing.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.324
Ugh! I can't even talk wrong!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.809
Oh, it's hard being so perfect.

19:58.748 --> 20:01.335
I feel ya, sister. Being smooth and
cool all the time is a blessing

20:01.359 --> 20:03.217
and a curse.

20:03.252 --> 20:04.572
You stepped in
another mop bucket.

20:05.671 --> 20:06.671
Come on!

20:07.865 --> 20:11.951
I'm sorry, Amelia. We really
thought you could do it.

20:11.986 --> 20:15.504
Forget it. I guess outtakes
just aren't my thing.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.540
(fart sound)

20:19.918 --> 20:22.152
Did you guys get that?

20:22.187 --> 20:24.705
Please tell me you got that!

20:24.740 --> 20:25.740
'Cause I farted!

20:27.734 --> 20:28.934
I... I probably didn't get it.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.686
No... No, wait, I did!

20:31.722 --> 20:35.582
I did, I left the camera rolling!
Amelia! You have an outtake!

20:35.617 --> 20:38.102
Bernie Schotz
is not a total failure!

20:41.565 --> 20:46.610
Bernie/Dirk/Amelia: Nooooo!

20:48.931 --> 20:50.030
(splash)

20:55.254 --> 20:57.079
I hate you, Deep Fryer Channel!

21:01.844 --> 21:02.844
(bell dings)

21:05.130 --> 21:06.880
Well... saw that comin'.

21:11.562 --> 21:15.089
Frankie! I have some
floss stuck in my teeth.

21:15.124 --> 21:16.223
Can you help me get it out?

21:18.302 --> 21:19.310
Yes.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.438
Ohhh...

21:23.474 --> 21:25.899
Thanks. Peer mentors for life.

21:31.232 --> 21:33.198
Frankie, I feel terrible.

21:33.234 --> 21:34.725
This bet has gotten out of hand.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.810
Marlene is never
gonna leave you alone.

21:36.845 --> 21:38.887
I know.
I wish I could get a break.

21:38.922 --> 21:44.218
Maybe I could hang out with her
sometime, just to give you a breather.

21:44.253 --> 21:46.954
Really? You'll help me out?

21:46.989 --> 21:48.881
- Yes.
- Ha! You said yes!

21:48.916 --> 21:51.524
I win the bet!

21:51.560 --> 21:53.627
Wait, what? What's going on?

21:53.663 --> 21:56.839
The long con, sister,
that's what's goin' on.

21:56.874 --> 22:00.250
I set you up to say "yes"! I knew you
were too good of a person to resist

22:00.285 --> 22:02.586
helping out your best friend.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.501
- What about Marlene?
- I met her in Drama Club.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.944
Sorry, Paige. I couldn't pass up
a real-life acting opportunity!

22:12.915 --> 22:16.107
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to see a dentist.

22:16.143 --> 22:17.823
I seem to have flossed
my gums to the bone.

22:19.596 --> 22:20.716
See you in Drama Club, girl.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.094
Why are you smiling?
You lost the bet.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.311
You like being in Drama Club.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.090
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.976
You opened yourself up to something
new and now you love it!

22:34.011 --> 22:35.427
Ha! So I won the bet!

22:37.098 --> 22:39.248
Emotionally.

22:39.283 --> 22:43.644
Fine, I love it. Now, if you
need me, I'll be at the arcade

22:43.679 --> 22:45.499
cashing in Mount Ticket-Manjaro
for my fighting robot,

22:45.523 --> 22:50.109
Puncho McRocketfists. That's right.
I named him.

22:55.766 --> 23:00.301
Behold!
Two-thousand spider rings!

23:00.337 --> 23:02.412
What? What happened to Puncho?

23:02.447 --> 23:04.615
Well, turns out Puncho
was 90,000 tickets

23:04.650 --> 23:07.893
and we only 89,997, so...

23:07.929 --> 23:10.061
You're wearing a belt
made of tickets.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.339
Paige, this? This is fashion.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.712
Frankie, what the heck
are we gonna do

23:15.736 --> 23:18.379
with a bunch of spider rings?

23:18.414 --> 23:22.433
Behold... Mount Spiderest!

23:22.468 --> 23:23.625
We are nothing

23:23.661 --> 23:27.988
if not consistent.
