00:01.203 --> 00:03.047
<i>Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:03.147 --> 00:06.130
<i>We're coming to the end here.</i>

00:06.257 --> 00:07.817
- The girl is sick.
<i>- She's in the turn.</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:10.551
<i>The anti-viral is the only
thing that can save her.</i>

00:10.636 --> 00:13.262
<i>You will look back on this
with searing regret.</i>

00:13.305 --> 00:14.825
<i>Is this the way you saw
your career, Dr. Lear?</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:16.557
<i>Using human beings as lab rats?</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:18.726
I'm the author of this horror.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.644
<i>The risks are unacceptable.</i>

00:20.730 --> 00:23.397
<i>How can the Department
of Defense not see this?</i>

00:23.482 --> 00:25.002
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna kill him.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.317
I'm gonna kill them all.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.653
<i>If you want safe passage,
you need me.</i>

00:29.739 --> 00:32.448
You're a monster
and I will kill you.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.366
<i>The virals,
they're all connected.</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:35.971
<i>They have a hive mind, and
they're all linked to Fanning.</i>

00:35.995 --> 00:39.455
- We need 12.
- She's not your 12th.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.708
<i>Amy will turn.
She's better off dead.</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:45.461
As of today,
you're all relieved of duty.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.704
- You're making a terrible mistake.
- Go pack your bags.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.216
- How do we override?
- Guilder.

00:53.637 --> 00:54.970
<i>Grey locked me in the lab.</i>

00:55.097 --> 00:56.263
No!

00:58.476 --> 01:00.642
Grey! You'll kill us all!

01:02.146 --> 01:03.266
What the hell are you doing?

01:04.982 --> 01:05.982
What does Fanning want?

01:06.067 --> 01:07.941
...Amy.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.860
<i>What any prisoner wants...</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:13.573
To be free.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.782
Here we go.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.492
<i>The cages are open.</i>

01:16.619 --> 01:17.826
<i>We have to go.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.763 --> 01:39.139
Just stay away from him,
all right?

01:44.980 --> 01:48.857
<i>I didn't used to believe
in monsters, but I do now.</i>

01:52.530 --> 01:53.821
Jonas.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.156
Chopper's ready.
We need to go.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.449
What's the situation outside?

01:57.535 --> 01:59.409
The locals say they want us
to kill him,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.036
before he kills all of us.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.872
That's Tim. He needs our help.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.749
- I'm just the messenger here.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.380
Guess I shouldn't have skipped
my vaccines, huh?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.965
Think customs will clear me?

02:13.050 --> 02:14.424
Hey, don't worry, buddy.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.593
We're flying private.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.264
This is ridiculous,
you gotta end it now.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.432
I got a team of doctors
back in the States.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.268
You're gonna be okay.

02:24.395 --> 02:25.727
I'm gonna help you.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.063
Shoot me.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.149
No.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.193
Jonas.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.698
You saw that thing
in the cave, right?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.451
Something's happening to me.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.747
I'm changing.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.666
It's not good.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.835
Come on.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.523
<i>There were so many times
they could have turned back.</i>

02:51.547 --> 02:53.547
<i>That they could've said "stop."</i>

02:53.632 --> 02:55.382
<i>But they didn't.</i>

02:55.467 --> 02:58.594
<i>By the time anybody bothered
to try, it was too late.</i>

03:00.556 --> 03:01.972
We need to get out of here.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.057
We got to get back upstairs.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.560
Come on, come on. Come on!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.687
We're not bringing her.
Listen to me,

03:08.731 --> 03:09.875
we don't know what she is yet.

03:09.899 --> 03:10.772
We do know what she is.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.149
She's Amy.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.354
They woke up because of her.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.527
Is he right? Is that true?

03:15.613 --> 03:17.029
Do you want to drink my blood?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.352
Deep down inside? Even a little?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.282
- No.
- Then we're good.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.534
Let's go. You can stay put
if you want.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.130
What's the holdup?

03:35.257 --> 03:36.757
We need to get down there.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.092
The car was immobilized on 4B

03:39.178 --> 03:40.572
when the cellblock
went into lockdown.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.012
Override the damn thing.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.513
I'm trying.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.368
Guilder's team reset all
the security permissions.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.226
Everything's a mess.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.939
Lila!

03:52.066 --> 03:53.774
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.401
What happened?

03:56.528 --> 03:57.861
Some guy hit me in the head.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.488
Sykes has the anti-viral
for Amy.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.864
But she's locked in the lab.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.494
She's okay,
she made it through the turn.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.007
I'm assuming that pounding
is bad news.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.760
Yeah, the virals are out
of their cages.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.764
I think it's my fault.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.557
None of this is your fault.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.017
Right now we have to go.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.436
Here. Untie them.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.565
Richards.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.809
We have three soldiers and
a med tech down here with us.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.569
Sykes is locked in the lab.
Can you help?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.238
<i>We can't get to you yet.</i>

04:41.365 --> 04:44.116
The elevator's stuck down
on your level.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.868
It's the only way on or off of
4B, but we're gonna get to you,

04:46.954 --> 04:48.745
you just gotta get to
the security lobby.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.295
All right, gear up. Quickly.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.299
We got to free Sykes
and get to the lobby.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.884
Secure the cellblock door.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.761
Ready, guys?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.930
Let's get her out. Richards.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.160
The cellblock door's not gonna
hold the virals much longer.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.226
<i>Wolgast, what happened?</i>

05:11.312 --> 05:13.792
The gas should have been enough
to keep the virals unconscious.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.779
Amy's fever broke.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.865
She didn't turn into
one of them, but...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.492
the other virals woke up
with her.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.995
It's 12.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.539
That's what Fanning wanted,

05:32.583 --> 05:35.125
a hive mind of 12 virals,
and now he has it with Amy.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.210
You heard Wolgast.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.339
The virals are gonna get out
unless we put a stop to it.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.425
We're not doing that. Not yet.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.613
We put the protocol in place
for this exact situation.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.740
Jonas, we're not
detonating explosives

05:46.764 --> 05:48.180
with our own people down there.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.891
Nor can we let the entire world
suffer for our mistakes.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.061
And we won't. We need to give
Sykes and Wolgast a chance.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.320
Let's go, guys.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.863
Hold the door.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.494
Push!

06:11.705 --> 06:12.829
This thing's a fortress.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.925
Amy?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.260
We're waiting for you.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.931
What do you want?

06:31.058 --> 06:34.768
I want you to meet the family.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.563
No, thank you.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.150
Can I tell you a little secret?

06:42.236 --> 06:44.486
Okay.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.698
I like you the best.

06:48.826 --> 06:52.828
And when I say family,
I mean that literally.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.206
Because my blood flows
through your veins,

06:56.333 --> 07:00.001
as it does with every one
of the 12.

07:00.129 --> 07:03.130
So do you know what that means?

07:03.215 --> 07:07.634
That means we're stuck
with each other.

07:10.305 --> 07:14.391
Your family is trapped in the
cellblock and we need you!

07:14.476 --> 07:16.184
You're not my family!

07:17.438 --> 07:19.020
Amy.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.772
Come on, sweetie, stay by us.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.798
This is as far as I go.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.425
Thanks for the lift.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.760
Good luck out there.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.631
I need to reboot the system.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.924
What does that look like?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.009
Power down.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.676
Computers go into safe mode.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.094
Elevators work.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.721
All right, get on it.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.727
- Hey, I need you to check the other security terminal.
- Okay.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.813
Sykes, we can't shoot
through the glass,

08:43.899 --> 08:45.941
but maybe we can pry
the entire panel out.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.734
- There isn't enough time.
<i>- Wolgast.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:49.819
<i>They're really picking up pace.</i>

08:49.905 --> 08:52.447
Maybe I should drop back
to the elevator.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.158
Hold your position, Guilder.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.588
They've stopped.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.277
<i>Something's happening,
I don't like it.</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:21.685
Brad, good news.
We're gonna reboot the system,

09:21.770 --> 09:23.186
<i>get the elevator working.</i>

09:23.272 --> 09:26.898
Richards. It's quiet down here,
where are they?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.358
Stand by.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.110
Rebooting.

09:32.948 --> 09:36.199
<i>Take Amy and get out of here.
Just go.</i>

09:36.326 --> 09:37.993
<i>We can figure this out.</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:39.327
<i>I said go!</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:50.422
What the hell?

10:09.192 --> 10:12.193
- Run!
- Go, go!

10:12.279 --> 10:13.737
They're in the air ducts.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.621
<i>Nichole, just sit tight,
we're gonna find a way.</i>

10:22.664 --> 10:26.833
Don't. After Amy gets up that
elevator, bury these monsters.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.210
<i>Bury all of it.</i>

10:29.296 --> 10:31.963
We got it. Elevator's unlocked.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.381
Brad, the doors are open.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.424
Get on the elevator.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.509
Go! Get to the elevator!

10:36.595 --> 10:38.928
Go!

11:03.538 --> 11:04.538
Go!

11:08.960 --> 11:11.753
No!

11:16.593 --> 11:17.967
Carter, don't hurt her!

11:18.095 --> 11:19.969
No!

11:23.058 --> 11:25.141
No!

11:45.330 --> 11:47.580
Get in!

11:47.666 --> 11:49.541
Show me.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.626
Show me!

11:50.669 --> 11:52.919
We both know what this means.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.046
- You're getting on that elevator.
- No.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.423
I am infected.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.258
No!

11:58.343 --> 11:59.779
I love you.
I'm not gonna lose you again.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.969
Sykes has a cure in the lab.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.804
I'll fix this.
Take care of her.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.140
Okay, so,

12:47.267 --> 12:48.308
she's infected, I mean,

12:48.393 --> 12:49.726
shouldn't she be restrained?

12:49.811 --> 12:50.894
Or, frankly, shot?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.228
Guilder, shut up.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.271
Clark, he's right.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.440
We know what happens next.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.151
Well, that's bravery talking
right there.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.487
Guilder, I will rip
that mustache off your face

13:00.572 --> 13:02.697
and feed it to you
if you say another word.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.243
Brad is gonna come back.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.120
He's gonna bring you the cure.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.791
Brad Wolgast is as good as dead.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.093
All right.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.095
Deep breath.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.558
So you say that Fanning,

13:30.644 --> 13:31.810
he took you to a tunnel?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.772
He told me to go through it.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.692
It was scary, but...

13:39.778 --> 13:42.862
I went the other way instead.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.697
Rode right past him.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.704
Why are you smiling?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.834
Because you did it.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.462
You, um...

14:01.508 --> 14:05.093
You came through your turn
in perfect health.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.470
Are you sure?

14:07.597 --> 14:10.765
I can still hear him.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.225
His blood is still in me.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.270
So if he dies, I die, right?

14:18.817 --> 14:21.317
There's still a lot
we don't understand, but...

14:21.403 --> 14:25.238
there's one thing I do know.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.409
Fanning took his best shot
at you,

14:29.494 --> 14:33.079
and you told him to go to hell.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.669
<i>Nichole, slight change
of plans.</i>

14:39.754 --> 14:41.588
<i>Wolgast is on his way to you.</i>

14:41.673 --> 14:43.715
What? No. Is he trying

14:43.800 --> 14:45.091
<i>to get himself killed?</i>

14:45.218 --> 14:46.759
Amy is up here safe,

14:46.887 --> 14:48.428
but Lila got infected
on the way out.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.555
She needs your antiviral serum.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.520
Hey.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.272
You want to hear
something crazy?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.983
<i>News just broke out
of Switzerland. Apparently,</i>

15:02.068 --> 15:04.360
they cracked the vaccine
for the bird flu pandemic.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.653
<i>Great.</i>

15:07.908 --> 15:09.073
That's great.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.910
<i>God, remember the avian flu?</i>

15:13.163 --> 15:14.913
Those were the days.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.206
I know.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.126
Now we just need your cure
for the vampire flu.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.956
<i>Hey, um, how 'bout</i>

15:24.966 --> 15:27.467
you stay on the line
but we talk about anything else?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.469
Here they are, sir.

15:30.931 --> 15:31.804
Hey.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.765
How about an activity?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.391
I'm gonna show you how

15:35.477 --> 15:37.810
<i>to hot-wire the security panel
for the airlock.</i>

15:41.483 --> 15:43.191
Is this
a "cut the red wire" thing?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.026
No, it's actually
a "cut the green wire",

15:45.111 --> 15:47.006
splice it with the yellow,
twist it around the red."

15:47.030 --> 15:48.237
Come on, you're getting

15:48.365 --> 15:49.967
<i>a little ahead of yourself.
I just want you</i>

15:49.991 --> 15:51.157
to find a screwdriver.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.992
Okay.

16:06.758 --> 16:10.301
Why didn't they just kill me?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.638
Why?

16:14.683 --> 16:15.974
Why?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.608
Now, it's gonna be a live wire,

16:25.694 --> 16:28.361
so I want you to be really
careful when you're cutting it.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.697
Okay, there are 12 wires.

16:30.824 --> 16:31.824
<i>Perfect.</i>

16:31.866 --> 16:33.324
<i>It's the fourth wire</i>

16:33.410 --> 16:35.535
<i>from the left.
What color is that?</i>

16:35.662 --> 16:36.911
It's red.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.539
Well, what do you know?
You were right all along.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.084
What happens if I cut

16:43.128 --> 16:44.855
- the wrong wire?
<i>- Well, nothing's gonna explode,</i>

16:44.879 --> 16:46.295
if that's what you're asking.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.131
Now, I just need you to remove

16:48.216 --> 16:49.590
<i>the insulation from that wire</i>

16:49.718 --> 16:52.176
<i>and you're gonna twist it
around the yellow wire.</i>

16:56.933 --> 16:58.099
Hey,

16:58.226 --> 16:59.559
once we get this door open,

16:59.644 --> 17:00.935
how are we getting out of here?

17:02.147 --> 17:03.646
I'm working on that.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.690
Just one problem at a time.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.529
Okay, the wires are connected.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.031
<i>Now, hold down</i>

17:13.116 --> 17:15.742
the override button.
You're gonna take

17:15.785 --> 17:17.637
<i>the exposed end of the wire
and you're gonna connect it</i>

17:17.662 --> 17:19.412
<i>to the negative power terminal.</i>

17:23.960 --> 17:24.960
We got it!

17:35.930 --> 17:38.090
Okay, Nichole, now, what kind
of firepower do you have?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.144
Nichole.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.985
Babcock.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.052
Hi, I just thought
I would check in,

18:16.137 --> 18:17.178
see how you're doing.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.930
Okay.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.598
What would you like to hear?

18:20.683 --> 18:22.016
It's up to you.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.018
You're brand-new
to begging for survival

18:24.104 --> 18:26.395
in the face
of arbitrary cruelty, so...

18:26.523 --> 18:28.898
try some things on.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.817
I'm too tired for games, Shauna.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.029
Why are you stalling?

18:35.115 --> 18:37.365
I thought you wanted to know
what I taste like.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.747
Why were you nice to me?

18:44.833 --> 18:46.207
- What?
- Were you that nice

18:46.292 --> 18:47.708
to all of us?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.460
You're asking me this now?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.841
No.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.802
The ones who came before you
scared the hell out of me.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.221
They were the worst

19:00.306 --> 19:02.265
humanity had to offer.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.434
And I was different?

19:05.562 --> 19:08.020
Yeah, Shauna, you're different.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.230
How?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.317
You were smart and funny.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.946
And, in another world,
we could have been friends.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.284
And you weren't a...

19:21.369 --> 19:23.494
cruel, amoral,
psychotic murderer,

19:23.621 --> 19:26.372
and I still don't think
you're one now either.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.343
Fanning wants us to go out
and eat the world.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.304
Just, like, grab people
and drink 'em.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.973
Like, moms and dads and kids.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.142
You know, nice families,
not crappy ones.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.644
Innocent people.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.689
It just seems like a lot.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.610
It does.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.948
Maybe there's another way.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.380
Shauna, no!

20:16.466 --> 20:19.091
Sykes, stay down.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.064
...You ready to get out of here?

20:33.191 --> 20:35.066
Yeah.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.819
Richards, I have Sykes.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.197
<i>We have the anti-viral.</i>

20:45.161 --> 20:47.078
<i>We're heading to the elevator.</i>

20:47.163 --> 20:48.579
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not yet.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.122
You need to stay put.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.958
<i>You need to find
a safe place to hide.</i>

20:52.043 --> 20:55.503
I've got one,
but you're not gonna like it.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.424
Brad, I'm seeing the virals

21:00.510 --> 21:01.779
<i>have moved away
from the elevator.</i>

21:01.803 --> 21:03.886
<i>Do you have eyes on them?</i>

21:03.972 --> 21:05.137
Affirmative.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.139
I have eyes on all of 'em.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.557
We're in Fanning's cell.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.226
Can you help us out?

21:33.293 --> 21:34.478
Richards,
these things are real ugly.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.793
Can you get us out of here?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.551
Stand by.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.387
I want you to pull up the layout
for the retrofit.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.222
There's got to be
another way off of 4B.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.843
They're surrounded in there.
Look,

21:52.895 --> 21:54.228
Wolgast and Sykes are gonna die.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.315
You need to start
those input codes now.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.321
We gave them
as much time as we could.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.114
- Jonas.
- It's too dangerous to wait.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.700
We have to end this now.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.628
You need to pay attention
to what they're saying,

22:19.756 --> 22:21.047
'cause it affects you.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.217
Sorry about earlier.
I shouldn't have yelled.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.636
But it's been a crazy day.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.680
I hate you.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.891
You know, I've been waiting
for three years

22:32.018 --> 22:33.801
in that cell
for this day to come.

22:33.895 --> 22:37.229
- I don't care.
- It's been such a mess since Bolivia.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.106
We underestimated the virus,

22:39.233 --> 22:41.275
and Jonas, he wanted
to just go ahead.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.195
- He should have stopped.
- I know, right?

22:44.322 --> 22:45.738
You got to let it go.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.865
He forgot that stopping
was even an option, but...

22:47.992 --> 22:51.994
he did put in a contingency plan
in case it all went sideways.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.515
- Why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause that's

22:53.539 --> 22:55.998
what they're talking about, Amy.

22:56.084 --> 22:59.210
It's a bomb to blow up 4B.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.796
You know what
they're calling it?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.339
The Elizabeth Protocol.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.007
I mean, does that
sound romantic to you?

23:05.093 --> 23:06.759
'Cause it sounds morbid to me.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.428
But Jonas, he's ready
to press that button right now.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.264
- He wouldn't do that with the agent down there.
- Yeah, he would.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.744
He would do anything
to end his guilt.

23:13.768 --> 23:16.477
He would kill the agent
in a heartbeat,

23:16.562 --> 23:18.437
because killing me...

23:18.564 --> 23:20.898
is gonna make him very happy.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.192
But guess what?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.403
If I die, you die.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.197
Maybe, maybe not.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.991
Come on, you know
that's the truth, Amy.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.453
You need to stop them
from using that bomb.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.458
Will you do it?

23:41.462 --> 23:43.546
How many times
has the agent saved you?

23:46.634 --> 23:49.593
You could return the favor.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.433
When they retrofitted
the old cellblock,

23:55.560 --> 23:58.227
there was a... a ventilation
shaft that they used

23:58.312 --> 24:01.021
to survey the foundation.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.357
You want to use that
to get them off 4B?

24:03.484 --> 24:05.629
There's no way off of 4B.
That's the whole point of 4B!

24:05.653 --> 24:07.339
- Guilder... Haven't
you done enough for 'em?

24:07.363 --> 24:08.904
This needs to end.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.698
What we need is to
get our people safe.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.302
What about the rest of
the people? Don't they matter?

24:12.326 --> 24:14.326
They deserve the chance.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.755
Hey, friend.

24:26.841 --> 24:29.008
You can't hide here forever.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.347
You know what you have to do.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.561
Why do I have to be
the one to fix this?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.022
That's the way it is.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.859
It's too hard.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.361
You're stronger than you know.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.739
It's not fair

24:51.866 --> 24:54.408
the way this all went down.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.994
I hate that it's
on your shoulders.

24:57.121 --> 25:01.248
But somebody has to stop us.

25:01.334 --> 25:04.585
And no matter what you do...

25:04.670 --> 25:06.587
there will be sorrow.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.673
Yours...

25:09.717 --> 25:12.510
or the world's.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.804
I can't.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.766
I can't do it.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.394
You have to.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.997
Detonate that bomb,
now before it's too late!

25:49.090 --> 25:51.382
Have you lost your mind?

25:51.425 --> 25:52.800
Fanning's gonna destroy
the world

25:52.927 --> 25:54.718
unless we stop him!

25:54.762 --> 25:57.241
- You don't get to call this because you feel guilty.
- Isn't that

25:57.265 --> 25:59.034
- what you're doing?
- You get one step closer and I will shoot you, too.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.433
- Guys.
- I am not letting you kill those people.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.234
Just relax, Richards.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.153
Sykes was the one
who started this.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.937
We don't get to kill her.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.794
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.450
Clark, is that
what I think it is?

27:41.494 --> 27:43.410
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:43.496 --> 27:47.164
<i>You've got less than
two minutes before 4B blows.</i>

27:50.378 --> 27:53.295
If Fanning dies, Amy dies!

27:53.381 --> 27:54.880
<i>Who pushed the button?</i>

28:00.262 --> 28:02.429
Amy did.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.537
Richards.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.126
- Found something.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.419
Brad.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.504
<i>We just found your exit.
Leave the cell.</i>

28:35.631 --> 28:37.339
Turn left.
There's an unmarked access panel

28:37.466 --> 28:38.590
on the far wall.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.152
Oh, I see it!

28:58.237 --> 28:59.862
The panel is right here.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.739
Clark, we found the panel.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.490
Climb fast.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.539
Nichole, you've got
two virals closing in.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.796
It's clear. Let's go.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.881
<i>20 seconds.</i>

29:20.176 --> 29:21.216
Come on.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.720
Save your wife.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.847
Get the last dose to the CDC.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.558
- And take care of Amy.
- Let's go, Sykes!

29:29.685 --> 29:31.101
...It has to be me.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.228
There isn't enough time.
Just go!

29:33.314 --> 29:34.354
<i>15 seconds.</i>

29:34.398 --> 29:36.857
Go! Go!

29:36.984 --> 29:38.734
Hey, Clark...

29:38.861 --> 29:41.445
I know what you're gonna say.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.614
I love you, Nichole.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.158
...I love you, too.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.785
See you around.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.508
Hey, open it up!

30:02.593 --> 30:03.717
I'm coming up. Open!

30:03.803 --> 30:06.220
- Richards.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.474
Come on.

30:15.648 --> 30:16.730
Let's go!

30:24.031 --> 30:25.656
Richards, let's go.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.030
It's remarkable.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.826
Sykes did it.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.079
She did it.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.958
I'm Dr. Jonas Lear.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.877
You're gonna be okay.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.595
Hi. You made it.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.763
- I told you I would.
- Mm.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.518
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.729
Amy took great care of me.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.197
I'm sorry.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.782
Stop.

31:50.868 --> 31:53.160
You're the bravest person
I've ever met.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.958
So the virals are buried on 4B.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.419
Is there
any confirmation of that?

32:04.006 --> 32:07.007
Trackers are down,
but the bomb went off.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.426
And Amy's still alive.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.059
Tisdale, this is Richards.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.727
You at the elevator?

32:23.567 --> 32:25.692
Tisdale, what's your status?

32:30.032 --> 32:31.865
What's wrong?

32:31.951 --> 32:33.659
I can hear them.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.288
They're alive.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.960
And they're coming for us.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.180
<i>Team A, do you copy?</i>

32:57.851 --> 32:59.768
<i>Alpha team?</i>

33:03.273 --> 33:05.190
<i>Does anyone copy?</i>

33:35.514 --> 33:37.389
<i>It's over, Jonas.</i>

33:37.474 --> 33:39.808
You lost.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.560
Now send me the girl,

33:41.645 --> 33:43.562
and I'll be out
of your hair forever.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.125
Got six virals
covering the exits.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.877
The others are out there, too.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.670
How many men do you have left?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.172
We've got ten.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.797
Maybe a dozen more civilians,

34:11.925 --> 34:13.632
but I have no idea
who can fire a gun.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.929
Hey.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.016
I got you into this mess.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.684
Least I can do is get you out.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.101
Thanks.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.228
Ramirez, we're gonna link up

34:26.315 --> 34:27.542
- at the north exit right now.
- Hey.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.650
You make sure
this gets to the CDC.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.360
But remember,

34:32.446 --> 34:34.362
Amy has to be
your first priority.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.989
I think Fanning's afraid of her.

34:37.117 --> 34:40.118
Someday she could be
strong enough to fight him.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.830
Will do.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.291
All right, let's go. Stay close.

35:07.898 --> 35:11.024
- Watch your backs!
- I can't see them!

35:24.456 --> 35:25.580
Go, go, go!

35:36.093 --> 35:39.886
Push them back. Push them back.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.721
Cover me.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.350
We're holding the position,
brother.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.663
<i>It's as good as it's gonna get.</i>

35:46.687 --> 35:49.062
- Copy that. Ready?
- Yeah.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.981
Stay in the light.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.658
Get her out of here. Go, go.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.246
Protect the tree line!

36:17.718 --> 36:20.010
Get off me!

36:42.868 --> 36:44.548
Let's keep going.
We're almost to the road.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.334
- Amy!
- Amy?

36:53.378 --> 36:54.461
Amy?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.297
Amy!

36:57.424 --> 36:58.757
Amy?!

37:01.595 --> 37:03.470
Amy?

37:03.597 --> 37:05.513
Amy!

37:05.599 --> 37:07.265
Let me go.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.327
I'm here, Fanning.

37:27.454 --> 37:29.329
I'm here.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.326
- Amy!
- Amy!

38:11.331 --> 38:12.622
What happened?

38:12.708 --> 38:14.708
- I don't... I don't know.
- Come on.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.479
- It's okay. You're here now.
- Go. Make it to the road.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.420
Let's go. Careful.

38:21.508 --> 38:22.757
- Get in.
- Oh, my God.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.217
- Lacey?
- Car's for you.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.428
We all have our jobs now.

38:30.017 --> 38:32.767
Yours is the toughest.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.185
You're stuck with these two.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.859
- Good luck.
- Lacey.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.819
You sure?

38:42.904 --> 38:45.322
Trust in the higher power,
Bradley.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.314
I was wondering when
you were gonna show up.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.962
I thought this might be
a nicer place to die.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.676
What happened to Nichole?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.648
She died in the blast.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.024
It was quick.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.822
You think that makes it better?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.282
I tried to get you ready
for this.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.160
Everything is different now.

40:14.287 --> 40:17.330
Yeah, well, I hate it.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.624
You're the one
who's gonna have to make peace

40:19.751 --> 40:21.918
with what happens next.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.671
You sure you don't want
to come with me?

40:28.093 --> 40:30.385
No way.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.929
I didn't even tell you
where I'm going next.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.181
I'm going home.

40:35.267 --> 40:38.435
Vegas.

40:38.478 --> 40:41.271
I hear it's nice
this time of year.

40:41.398 --> 40:43.982
It would be nicer
with you there.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.027
Why is that?

40:50.115 --> 40:53.366
I don't want to live
like an animal.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.910
Maybe you could
keep me on track.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.873
Maybe I could be

41:00.000 --> 41:02.500
that girl in the diner again.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.757
It's not how
I pictured retirement.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.509
Or the afterlife.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.845
It's neither of those things,
Clark.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.264
Everybody gets one person.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.059
What does that mean?

41:20.187 --> 41:22.353
You'd still be you.

41:22.439 --> 41:25.732
But you have to want me
to do it.

41:25.859 --> 41:28.526
I'm not gonna force anything
on you.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.577
What do you say?

41:39.998 --> 41:42.832
You want in?

42:55.782 --> 42:57.991
<i>In the end, it was quick.</i>

42:58.076 --> 43:01.244
<i>From the moment
the cell doors opened,</i>

43:01.329 --> 43:04.497
<i>it only took 52 minutes
for one world to end</i>

43:04.583 --> 43:06.666
<i>and another to be born.</i>
