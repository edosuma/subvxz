02:26.355 --> 02:27.724
Hi!

02:27.757 --> 02:30.292
I'm Carla.

02:32.595 --> 02:34.597
Well, I'm 31 from California.

02:38.066 --> 02:40.003
I like photography,

02:42.572 --> 02:43.406
singing,

02:44.874 --> 02:45.675
travel.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.577
I love to travel.

02:47.610 --> 02:48.444
I love to laugh.

02:49.746 --> 02:51.213
So I'm guess I'm
looking for someone

02:51.246 --> 02:55.919
that's funny, who has
a great sense of humor.

02:55.952 --> 02:58.153
Oh, but most importantly,

02:58.186 --> 03:02.291
he has to be strong
and confident

03:03.493 --> 03:05.060
and know exactly what he wants.

03:05.995 --> 03:07.463
Someone who could rescue me

03:07.497 --> 03:09.632
from a burning
building, you know?

03:11.668 --> 03:14.136
But not just physically strong.

03:14.169 --> 03:15.370
He has to be-

03:22.579 --> 03:24.313
Hi, my name is Mary.

03:24.346 --> 03:25.982
I'm from Portland

03:26.015 --> 03:28.350
and this is Benedict.

03:28.384 --> 03:29.586
Hi.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.487
My name is Benedict

03:31.521 --> 03:33.890
and I'm from the
south of England

03:33.923 --> 03:35.425
and I came to live-

03:38.895 --> 03:39.696
Oh.

03:39.729 --> 03:40.863
Oh!

03:40.897 --> 03:42.097
Hi!

03:42.130 --> 03:43.032
I'm Susan.

03:43.066 --> 03:44.434
I'm from South Dakota.

03:45.735 --> 03:47.971
Thanks for watching my tape.

03:48.004 --> 03:49.371
This feels so cheesy.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.841
But I guess if
you're watching this

03:51.874 --> 03:53.743
you're probably okay
with cheesy, so.

03:54.744 --> 03:56.211
I love movies.

03:56.244 --> 03:57.914
Every kind of movie really.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.850
Horror, sci-fi, romance.

04:00.883 --> 04:03.052
Yeah, to me there's
just nothing better

04:03.086 --> 04:05.421
than snuggling up
with your partner

04:05.455 --> 04:06.556
and putting in a tape.

04:08.091 --> 04:08.891
Yeah, I don't know.

04:08.925 --> 04:09.726
There's just something about

04:09.759 --> 04:10.893
that shared
experience that I love

04:10.927 --> 04:12.762
and so I'm looking
for someone to...

04:13.763 --> 04:16.298
Well, I'm looking for
someone to share that with.

04:16.331 --> 04:21.336
Um, yeah, someone who
is kind, gentle, caring,

04:22.405 --> 04:25.340
who will remind me that
everything is going to be okay

04:25.374 --> 04:28.711
and someone that will be
there for me no matter what.

04:31.514 --> 04:35.084
Oh, and he can't live in his
parent's basement.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.318
And his wife, Patsy.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.220
They're part of
a family ministry

05:12.254 --> 05:15.223
that was inspired by
God over 20 years ago

05:15.257 --> 05:18.161
to develop a Christian
interdenominational center

05:18.193 --> 05:19.729
that has since developed into

05:19.762 --> 05:22.297
the beautiful
Singing River Ranch.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.900
Glenn and his professional-

05:23.933 --> 05:26.301
Mom, can I get you anything?

05:26.334 --> 05:27.637
Hmm?

05:27.670 --> 05:29.271
Do you want any lunch?

05:30.106 --> 05:31.107
Macaroni.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.240
Blessed that God has provided

05:32.274 --> 05:34.043
one of the most
magnificent settings

05:34.077 --> 05:36.512
of pure Rocky Mountain beauty.

05:50.593 --> 05:52.227
Secretly
recorded conversation.

05:52.260 --> 05:53.463
Now I know that

05:53.496 --> 05:57.767
I did not say what they're-

06:00.169 --> 06:02.405
A mountain.

06:03.806 --> 06:05.942
A mountain is many things.

06:07.877 --> 06:09.679
Forests soaring free.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.650
Rock in staggering
shapes and sizes.

06:15.685 --> 06:19.122
Water resting for a
moment in little pools.

06:20.389 --> 06:22.525
I can eat my own goddamn food.

06:26.562 --> 06:29.398
Or pausing to nurture flowers

06:29.432 --> 06:30.733
of myriad variety.

06:33.069 --> 06:34.070
Mom.

06:35.671 --> 06:37.673
A mountain is weather
in primitive form.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.274
Goddamn it, Frank!

06:41.244 --> 06:43.946
Mom, I'm David.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.482
I know damn well who you are.

06:47.617 --> 06:48.684
Here.

06:48.718 --> 06:50.052
Let me help.

06:50.086 --> 06:51.387
Please.

06:51.420 --> 06:52.722
Striking the nearest

06:52.755 --> 06:54.757
of the Earth's surfaces.

06:55.792 --> 06:56.659
It's okay.

06:56.692 --> 07:00.362
The mountain is life
in beautiful form.

07:00.396 --> 07:02.064
Yeah, that a girl.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.923
It is February 20th, 1962

08:00.957 --> 08:03.292
and today, if all goes well,

08:03.326 --> 08:06.062
the men here will launch
an American astronaut

08:06.095 --> 08:08.030
into orbit around the world

08:08.064 --> 08:09.632
in a spacecraft which he-

08:09.665 --> 08:11.467
Views around the world

08:11.500 --> 08:14.704
on three continents
and on islands,

08:14.737 --> 08:16.138
in ships and planes

08:16.172 --> 08:19.876
and lands where it's summer
and tomorrow is near.

08:19.909 --> 08:21.344
He lands where it is winter

08:21.377 --> 08:26.382
and his day is just beginning.

08:28.084 --> 08:29.285
Wow!

08:29.318 --> 08:30.586
So pick up a handful

08:30.620 --> 08:33.522
of good old Rock
Creek Park dirt.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.792
It might have come all
the way from Africa.

08:36.826 --> 08:37.627
Wow!

08:37.660 --> 08:39.061
Or it might have come from

08:39.095 --> 08:40.730
the bottom of the sea.

08:40.763 --> 08:41.631
Wow!

08:41.664 --> 08:43.599
Hey, can I come back tomorrow?

08:43.633 --> 08:45.201
I'm gonna bring all my friends.

09:02.318 --> 09:04.487
Welcome to Video Rendezvous.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.056
If you have a touch
tone phone press one

09:07.089 --> 09:09.659
to speak to your
Rendezvous specialist.

09:09.692 --> 09:12.194
If you have a rotary
phone, dial seven.

09:14.864 --> 09:16.232
Thank you for calling
Video Rendezvous.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.199
This is Diane.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.434
How can I help you?

09:18.467 --> 09:19.268
Hi, Diane.

09:19.302 --> 09:21.137
It's me, David.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.138
I was wondering-

09:22.171 --> 09:24.774
May I have your Rendezvous
ID number, please?

09:24.807 --> 09:25.741
Oh, right.

09:25.775 --> 09:28.544
Yeah, it's 159017.

09:31.013 --> 09:32.214
Great.

09:32.248 --> 09:34.418
Just give me a moment to pull
up your Rendezvous profile.

09:42.792 --> 09:43.592
Here we are.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.361
And what can I do for you today?

09:45.395 --> 09:47.263
Yeah, I was
wondering if I've had

09:47.296 --> 09:49.298
any matches since
last time I called.

09:49.332 --> 09:52.436
Hmm, I'm sorry, sir,

09:52.468 --> 09:54.470
but it looks as though
no one has requested

09:54.503 --> 09:56.406
to connect with you yet.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.273
Oh.

09:59.275 --> 10:02.511
Is it common for matches
to take this long?

10:02.545 --> 10:04.381
Well, it's not uncommon.

10:04.414 --> 10:07.616
Finding the right person
isn't an exact science.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.985
However,

10:11.520 --> 10:12.788
I'm seeing here that you haven't

10:12.822 --> 10:15.791
updated your video profile
in about six months.

10:15.825 --> 10:17.394
Perhaps it's time for
you to come back down

10:17.427 --> 10:18.627
and record a new one.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.997
Getting a fresh tape into
circulation can help.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.902
Mom, I gotta run a quick errand.

10:26.936 --> 10:28.504
I'll be gone for about an hour.

10:28.537 --> 10:29.739
You be okay here?

10:31.307 --> 10:32.141
Great.

10:33.377 --> 10:34.276
That's our news for now.

10:34.310 --> 10:35.111
Thanks for watching.

10:35.144 --> 10:36.012
We'll see you tonight

10:36.045 --> 10:37.079
at 10:00 o'clock for
the late edition.

10:43.119 --> 10:44.587
Well, alrighty.

10:47.491 --> 10:48.824
Sit up nice and tall.

10:48.858 --> 10:49.959
Shoulders back.

10:51.961 --> 10:53.863
Why don't you give
us your best smile?

10:57.933 --> 10:58.734
I can do this.

10:58.768 --> 10:59.568
I can do this.

10:59.602 --> 11:00.870
Okay, okay.

11:00.903 --> 11:02.406
Ready.

11:06.275 --> 11:07.643
Hi.

11:07.676 --> 11:09.446
I'm David.

11:09.479 --> 11:12.882
I'm 40 years young.

11:12.915 --> 11:14.850
And um...

11:14.884 --> 11:17.787
Shoot, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.188
I live with my mother.

11:20.424 --> 11:21.757
She's 73.

11:22.758 --> 11:24.394
She has dementia

11:24.428 --> 11:26.328
and she needs 24 hour care.

11:27.696 --> 11:29.765
But I like being there for her

11:30.900 --> 11:33.736
'cause, well I like
being a caregiver.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.007
I think I've always
had an inclination

11:38.040 --> 11:40.810
to care for others
because of my father.

11:41.710 --> 11:45.214
He believed that we should
all be kind to each other,

11:45.247 --> 11:47.451
that without kindness,

11:47.484 --> 11:48.984
the world would get nowhere.

11:50.119 --> 11:54.123
So, I'm hoping to find
someone to share that with.

11:55.024 --> 11:56.892
Someone I can care for.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.428
Someone who could care for me.

12:00.162 --> 12:04.233
Someone I can give
myself to completely.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.170
I'm looking for
a deep connection

12:09.071 --> 12:12.708
based in love and mutual respect

12:12.741 --> 12:15.911
and ultimately, in happiness.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.616
So, if you're out
there watching this

12:21.518 --> 12:22.852
and you feel the same way,

12:24.019 --> 12:26.655
gosh, I'd love to meet you,

12:27.690 --> 12:28.624
whoever you are.

12:31.026 --> 12:32.228
Alrighty.

12:32.261 --> 12:33.229
Good job.

12:33.262 --> 12:34.564
The only problem is these videos

12:34.598 --> 12:36.365
are only about 30 seconds long.

12:36.399 --> 12:37.666
So why don't you try it again

12:37.700 --> 12:40.403
and keep it within that
30 second time frame?

12:40.437 --> 12:42.004
30 seconds?

12:42.037 --> 12:44.574
The tapes I've watched
seem much longer than that.

12:46.075 --> 12:48.310
Women get more time
than the men do.

12:48.344 --> 12:50.146
Men only typically
get about 30 seconds

12:50.179 --> 12:51.847
just because there's a
hell of a lot more guys

12:51.881 --> 12:53.649
that come in here than girls.

12:53.682 --> 12:55.684
Oh, that makes sense.

12:55.718 --> 12:56.553
Okay.

12:59.523 --> 13:01.424
Hi, I'm David.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.427
I'm 40 years old and
I live with my mother

13:05.562 --> 13:07.397
who has dementia.

13:07.430 --> 13:09.899
I'm looking for someone
to take care of me.

13:11.233 --> 13:13.637
I like taking care of women.

13:13.669 --> 13:17.106
I mean, so we can take
care of each other.

13:17.139 --> 13:19.675
We can um...

13:19.708 --> 13:23.812
Kindness is really
important to me.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.516
I think the world should
be a better place.

13:28.451 --> 13:32.254
Loneliness is...

13:32.288 --> 13:33.557
Uh...

13:33.590 --> 13:38.127
I really wanna meet
someone, anyone really,

13:38.160 --> 13:40.497
who's out there that
might wanna meet me.

13:40.530 --> 13:41.498
And cut.

13:41.531 --> 13:42.798
Hey, that was fantastic.

13:42.831 --> 13:43.966
You are a real catch.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.335
You're gonna make some
girl very happy someday.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.203
Next!

13:50.372 --> 13:51.173
Great!

13:51.207 --> 13:52.708
So, there's your card back

13:52.741 --> 13:55.110
and I'll just need your
signature right there.

13:55.144 --> 13:59.549
You know, in case you're
ever famous someday.

14:00.517 --> 14:03.886
I have some women from
my last set of tapes

14:03.919 --> 14:05.522
that I'd like to
try and match with.

14:05.555 --> 14:06.489
Oh, great.

14:06.523 --> 14:08.157
Great, well I'll get
these submitted for you.

14:08.190 --> 14:09.426
But, in the meantime,

14:09.459 --> 14:11.661
I've got a whole new
slew of great new videos

14:11.695 --> 14:13.762
picked out just for you.

14:13.796 --> 14:15.898
Let's see. There's
Karen from Ohio.

14:15.931 --> 14:16.999
She's a writer.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.335
And then I've got Sarah.

14:19.368 --> 14:22.071
She's a doctor, very successful.

14:22.104 --> 14:23.305
And then I've got-

14:23.339 --> 14:24.373
I'll take the set.

14:24.407 --> 14:25.508
Thank you.

14:25.542 --> 14:26.809
Wonderful.

14:26.842 --> 14:29.044
And, you know,
I've been thinking,

14:29.078 --> 14:30.913
have you tried to
match me with anyone-

14:30.946 --> 14:31.914
Thank you for calling
Video Rendezvous.

14:31.947 --> 14:33.949
This is Diane. How
can I help you?

14:35.552 --> 14:36.386
Uh-huh.

14:37.353 --> 14:38.254
Oh, uh-huh.

14:42.124 --> 14:42.958
Right.

14:44.026 --> 14:46.429
Oh.

14:46.463 --> 14:47.296
Uh-huh.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.033
Oh, that's fantastic.

14:53.503 --> 14:54.671
Right, right.

15:20.796 --> 15:21.864
Right, right.

16:17.086 --> 16:18.588
Hi! I'm Andy.

16:18.621 --> 16:20.657
Thanks for being here today.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.392
Well, let's cut to the chase.

16:22.425 --> 16:24.627
I'm here to be your friend.

16:24.661 --> 16:25.595
How's that sound?

16:28.598 --> 16:30.400
All right, that's great!

16:30.433 --> 16:31.668
Well, I am excited.

16:31.701 --> 16:34.571
I am really excited.

16:34.604 --> 16:37.507
I mean, I gotta be
honest with you here,

16:37.540 --> 16:39.476
I have been waiting
for this moment

16:39.509 --> 16:42.044
for what feels like forever.

16:43.011 --> 16:45.582
And gosh, I am just so pleased

16:45.615 --> 16:48.718
that you decided to take
this journey with me.

16:48.752 --> 16:50.620
We're gonna get to
know each other.

16:50.653 --> 16:53.288
We're gonna talk about
whatever you want.

16:53.322 --> 16:55.057
But more than anything,

16:55.090 --> 16:57.460
we're gonna have some fun.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.094
And hopefully it's the start

16:59.128 --> 17:01.296
of a beautiful relationship.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.164
What do you say?

17:07.002 --> 17:08.237
I know, I know.

17:15.645 --> 17:16.479
Mom.

17:25.287 --> 17:27.055
Mom!

17:27.089 --> 17:28.991
Mom, are you okay?

17:29.024 --> 17:31.761
Goddamn pice of shit door!

17:31.795 --> 17:32.595
Here, here.

17:32.629 --> 17:33.496
Let me.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.329
Easy.

17:34.363 --> 17:35.297
Easy, easy.

17:50.012 --> 17:52.981
Hey, Mom, what the
heck were you doing?

17:53.015 --> 17:55.117
I wanna go on a fucking walk.

17:55.150 --> 17:55.951
Okay.

17:55.984 --> 17:56.920
I mean, what were you...

18:01.089 --> 18:01.925
Hey.

18:03.593 --> 18:04.727
Let's watch a movie.

18:10.767 --> 18:11.601
Hmm.

18:31.353 --> 18:32.956
Wow!

18:32.988 --> 18:34.657
I don't believe you.

18:37.427 --> 18:38.695
Man, they always say friendships

18:38.728 --> 18:40.630
are full of surprises but boy!

18:53.977 --> 18:56.144
Here we go, Mom.

19:00.550 --> 19:01.384
Oh!

19:02.452 --> 19:04.587
I just love this movie.

19:06.088 --> 19:10.292
Frank and I took David
to see this movie

19:10.325 --> 19:11.494
when he was a baby.

19:12.896 --> 19:16.265
My sweetie David
didn't make a peep.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.736
He watched the whole movie.

19:22.005 --> 19:25.240
Of course, I could never
get tired of it either.

19:27.610 --> 19:28.645
Cary Grant.

19:30.413 --> 19:32.114
I swell up just looking at him.

19:37.020 --> 19:42.025
Well, I can't say I feel the
same way about Cary Grant.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.594
But this movie always
made me think of my mom.

19:46.696 --> 19:47.564
She loved it too.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.066
Somebody must've stolen
one of his crown jewels.

19:51.099 --> 19:52.134
Shall we announce you?

19:52.167 --> 19:54.136
Oh, no, no. I'll
blow my own horns.

19:54.169 --> 19:54.971
Bruce, you'd better wait here.

19:55.004 --> 19:56.806
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

19:56.839 --> 19:58.373
Even 10 minutes is a long time

19:58.408 --> 19:59.409
to be away from you.

20:01.276 --> 20:02.812
What did you say?

20:02.845 --> 20:04.346
What?

20:04.380 --> 20:06.281
Well-
Go on.

20:07.584 --> 20:08.818
Go ahead.

20:08.851 --> 20:10.386
I just said that even 10 minutes

20:10.420 --> 20:12.154
is a long time to
be away from you.

20:12.187 --> 20:13.890
I heard you the first
time. I like it.

20:13.923 --> 20:15.491
That's why I asked
you to say it again.

20:16.426 --> 20:17.927
I can stand being
spoiled a little.

20:17.961 --> 20:19.429
The gentleman I'm going
to have a chat with

20:19.462 --> 20:20.295
did very little spoiling.

20:20.329 --> 20:23.298
All right, here we go, Mom.

20:23.332 --> 20:24.132
Easy.

20:25.668 --> 20:26.736
There you go.

20:46.956 --> 20:47.790
That's it.

20:59.535 --> 21:00.937
Goodnight, Mom.

21:00.970 --> 21:03.906
Goodnight, sweetie.

21:03.940 --> 21:05.675
It's David.

22:28.725 --> 22:30.225
Hi! I'm Andy.

22:30.258 --> 22:32.227
Thanks for being here today.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.996
Well, let's cut to the chase.

22:34.030 --> 22:36.264
I'm here to be your friend.

22:36.298 --> 22:37.133
How's that sound?

22:37.166 --> 22:39.135
Oh, that sounds great, Andy.

22:40.103 --> 22:42.138
All right, that's great!

22:42.171 --> 22:43.539
Well, I am excited.

22:43.573 --> 22:46.308
I am really excited.

22:46.341 --> 22:49.244
I mean, I gotta be
honest with you here,

22:49.277 --> 22:51.180
I have been waiting
for this moment

22:51.214 --> 22:53.750
for what feels like forever.

22:54.817 --> 22:57.319
And, gosh, I am just so pleased

22:57.352 --> 23:00.456
that you decided to take
this journey with me.

23:00.490 --> 23:02.357
We're gonna get to
know each other.

23:02.391 --> 23:04.994
We're gonna talk about
whatever you want.

23:05.027 --> 23:06.796
But more than anything,

23:06.829 --> 23:09.198
we're gonna have some fun.

23:09.232 --> 23:13.035
And hopefully, it's the start
of a beautiful relationship.

23:13.069 --> 23:14.670
What do you say?

23:14.704 --> 23:16.639
Sounds fucking weird, Andy.

23:16.672 --> 23:18.174
Now, now, listen.

23:18.207 --> 23:19.408
I know what you're thinking.

23:19.442 --> 23:20.843
I know.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.846
And hey, this is a
little weird for me too

23:23.880 --> 23:25.313
'cause I've never
done this either.

23:25.347 --> 23:27.282
So it's totally new for me.

23:27.315 --> 23:28.751
It's new for both of us.

23:29.786 --> 23:33.422
But I guess that just means
we're in this together, right?

23:33.456 --> 23:36.125
You've got my back
and I've got yours.

23:36.159 --> 23:37.292
All right!

23:37.325 --> 23:39.829
So, let's just dive right in.

23:39.862 --> 23:41.964
Oh, where to start?

23:42.899 --> 23:43.800
I know!

23:43.833 --> 23:45.067
What is your name?

23:45.101 --> 23:46.736
Fuck you. That's my name.

23:46.769 --> 23:48.905
Oh. Yes!

23:48.938 --> 23:51.040
You know, your face
totally says that.

23:51.073 --> 23:52.542
I can totally see it.

23:53.376 --> 23:55.411
Well, it's really
nice to meet you.

23:55.444 --> 23:57.113
Where are you from?

23:57.146 --> 23:59.314
I was born in Lakewood

23:59.347 --> 24:01.951
but I live in Denver with Mom.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.453
Oh, what a beautiful area.

24:04.487 --> 24:06.222
You know, I have a
friend from there.

24:06.255 --> 24:08.024
Yeah, it really is great.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.427
Hey, can I take a
look at your place?

24:11.460 --> 24:13.462
Uh, sure.
Cool.

24:16.632 --> 24:17.934
Whoa.

24:19.635 --> 24:21.604
Whoa!

24:21.637 --> 24:24.372
Nice digs.

24:24.407 --> 24:26.609
Did you decorate
everything yourself?

24:26.642 --> 24:28.778
Most of this stuff's my mom's.

24:28.811 --> 24:30.345
I think it looks great.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.817
You, you have got
good taste, pal.

24:37.420 --> 24:40.156
Okay, so let me tell you

24:40.189 --> 24:41.490
a little bit about myself.

24:42.925 --> 24:44.193
I'm from Davenport.

24:46.562 --> 24:48.664
I'm unemployed at the moment

24:48.698 --> 24:49.498
but it's fine though.

24:49.532 --> 24:50.566
I have got lots of ideas

24:50.600 --> 24:52.001
on where to go from here.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.569
Do you work?

24:53.603 --> 24:55.404
I have to stay at home

24:55.438 --> 24:57.740
and take care of my mom.

24:57.773 --> 25:02.245
But we do just fine on
her social security.

25:02.278 --> 25:03.212
I hear you, man.

25:04.146 --> 25:04.981
I hear you.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.618
Did you know I lived at
home most of my life?

25:08.651 --> 25:10.019
Yeah, it was tough.

25:10.052 --> 25:12.221
Especially when you
have parents like mine.

25:13.823 --> 25:15.791
Like, you know the type, right?

25:15.825 --> 25:18.160
Overbearing and demanding,

25:18.194 --> 25:19.762
nothing's ever good enough.

25:20.963 --> 25:22.098
My mom...

25:24.133 --> 25:26.602
I love her but she was a
battle ax, I'll tell you.

25:27.770 --> 25:30.072
She used to spank me so hard.

25:31.707 --> 25:33.976
One time she spanked me so hard

25:34.010 --> 25:35.645
I threw up on the carpet.

25:36.913 --> 25:39.982
And it was unbelievable what
they got away with back then.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.884
Amen, brother.

25:41.918 --> 25:43.085
It's a wonder I didn't turn out

25:43.119 --> 25:45.187
to be some sort of
disturbed maniac.

25:47.023 --> 25:47.924
Anyway, listen.

25:47.957 --> 25:50.760
I am just totally
rambling on over here.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.496
What were your parents like?

25:55.399 --> 25:59.669
Well my Dad, Frank, was
a jazz musician actually.

25:59.702 --> 26:01.704
They used to call him FDR.

26:01.737 --> 26:04.907
He was on Carson once.

26:06.609 --> 26:08.978
He was on the road a lot.

26:09.011 --> 26:11.381
So mostly it was
just me and my mom.

26:12.382 --> 26:13.849
And she had-

26:13.883 --> 26:14.717
No kidding?

26:15.718 --> 26:17.553
Moms are so interesting,
aren't they?

26:19.088 --> 26:21.290
It sounds like you got
one of the good ones.

27:52.648 --> 27:53.483
Shut up.

28:00.056 --> 28:01.491
Right now live and in the midst

28:01.525 --> 28:03.359
with your favorite DJ.

28:04.593 --> 28:05.995
Good afternoon.

28:28.084 --> 28:28.918
Hi David.

28:28.951 --> 28:31.053
This is Diane from
Video Rendezvous.

28:31.087 --> 28:32.755
I'm calling with good news.

28:32.788 --> 28:33.789
Our dating specialists

28:33.823 --> 28:35.658
have been hard at
work for you here

28:35.691 --> 28:38.094
and have come up
with a perfect match.

28:38.127 --> 28:39.128
Her name is Lisa

28:39.161 --> 28:41.063
and I think you'll
really like her.

28:41.097 --> 28:43.467
She saw your video and
said you were quote,

28:43.500 --> 28:44.967
"Adorable."

28:45.000 --> 28:47.169
So, if you wanna come
down to the studio

28:47.203 --> 28:48.938
and get your information
packet, her tape,

28:48.971 --> 28:51.140
and then we can go from there.

28:51.173 --> 28:52.341
Call me back soon.

28:52.374 --> 28:53.209
Bye!

28:55.945 --> 28:58.347
Hey Mom, I gotta
run a quick errand.

28:58.381 --> 29:00.082
Will you be okay here for a bit?

29:00.983 --> 29:03.352
Pick me up some
fresh hand towels.

29:04.286 --> 29:06.590
Frank threw all
the good ones away.

29:11.127 --> 29:13.497
Well hi, David.

29:13.530 --> 29:15.030
Great to see you again so soon.

29:15.064 --> 29:17.066
I should say the same about you.

29:17.099 --> 29:18.901
Well, here is the tape

29:18.934 --> 29:21.070
and the write up on Lisa.

29:21.103 --> 29:22.138
Very exciting.

29:22.171 --> 29:24.840
I think you two will
match up wonderfully.

29:24.874 --> 29:27.544
Thank you so much for this.

29:27.577 --> 29:28.878
I can't wait to meet her.

29:28.911 --> 29:29.979
It's my pleasure, David.

29:30.012 --> 29:33.015
It's what I do.

29:33.048 --> 29:36.085
Um.

29:36.118 --> 29:36.986
Oh, right.

29:38.821 --> 29:39.655
Uh-oh.

29:40.557 --> 29:42.091
Oh no.

29:42.124 --> 29:44.427
I was in such a rush
to get over here

29:44.461 --> 29:45.995
I must've left my wallet.

29:46.028 --> 29:47.062
Oh no.

29:47.096 --> 29:48.364
That's so unfortunate.

29:48.398 --> 29:50.666
I'll run home and get my card

29:50.699 --> 29:52.168
and I'll be right back.

29:52.201 --> 29:53.102
Uh-uh-uh.

29:54.404 --> 29:55.539
Oh, right.

29:57.006 --> 29:58.908
I'll be right back, I promise.

29:58.941 --> 29:59.775
I promise.

30:14.957 --> 30:16.358
Isn't he?

30:16.393 --> 30:17.627
It's the hair, I think.

30:18.528 --> 30:20.129
Okay, have a great time.

30:20.162 --> 30:21.730
Bye.

30:21.764 --> 30:24.066
Hi, David.

30:24.099 --> 30:25.201
What's wrong?

30:25.234 --> 30:26.603
That was Lisa.

30:27.770 --> 30:29.805
She just matched
with someone else.

30:33.476 --> 30:34.377
I'm sorry, David.

30:34.411 --> 30:36.712
These things move
quick sometimes.

30:42.851 --> 30:44.454
Well, can I at least see

30:44.487 --> 30:45.689
what I'm missing out on?

30:57.766 --> 30:58.602
Uh-uh.

31:08.043 --> 31:10.447
Great. So there's
your card back.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.015
And I'll just need your
signature right there.

31:13.048 --> 31:16.785
You know, in case you're
ever famous someday.

31:51.488 --> 31:52.354
Hi.

31:52.389 --> 31:53.355
I'm Lisa.

31:55.224 --> 31:57.627
Oh man, this is so strange.

31:57.661 --> 31:59.061
I've never done this before.

32:00.829 --> 32:02.465
Well, I'm from Denver.

32:02.499 --> 32:06.569
I really enjoy arts
and crafts, reading.

32:06.603 --> 32:07.836
I read a lot of books.

32:09.071 --> 32:10.640
And I listen to jazz music.

32:10.674 --> 32:11.608
That's my favorite.

32:13.042 --> 32:15.144
Oh, I should mention
that I'm a caregiver.

32:16.078 --> 32:18.047
I went to nursing
school in college

32:18.080 --> 32:21.016
and now I work part
time as a hospice nurse.

32:22.385 --> 32:23.886
On the weekends I
like to volunteer

32:23.919 --> 32:25.888
at my local nursing home.

32:25.921 --> 32:27.823
I found that I really
enjoy spending time

32:27.856 --> 32:29.392
with the people there.

32:29.426 --> 32:30.359
They get very lonely

32:30.393 --> 32:31.994
and they don't have
many people left

32:32.027 --> 32:32.895
to come and see them.

32:32.928 --> 32:35.465
So, it's a good
feeling to give them

32:35.498 --> 32:36.965
the friendship and companionship

32:36.999 --> 32:37.966
that they deserve.

32:39.068 --> 32:41.504
These people are so interesting.

32:41.538 --> 32:43.138
They have histories
and backgrounds

32:43.172 --> 32:45.608
that are so layered and textured

32:45.642 --> 32:48.611
and it's just wonderful to
explore that together with them.

32:50.447 --> 32:51.246
Oh gosh, sorry.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.981
I'm rambling on.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.183
It's so weird with
all the lights

32:54.216 --> 32:55.518
and camera and everything.

32:56.486 --> 32:58.887
Well, anyway, whoever
you are out there,

32:58.921 --> 33:00.122
I hope to meet you soon.

33:15.304 --> 33:16.338
Sure you wanna quit?

33:16.372 --> 33:18.040
Now Bruce, what do you mean?

33:18.073 --> 33:19.341
Well, I mean if there's
any doubt about it

33:19.376 --> 33:21.411
or if there's anything that...

33:21.444 --> 33:23.513
No, this is your
chance to have a home

33:23.546 --> 33:25.648
and to be, like you
said, a human being

33:25.682 --> 33:28.117
and I'm gonna make
you take that chance.

33:28.150 --> 33:28.951
Certainly.

33:28.984 --> 33:30.453
Why, I wouldn't let her stay.

33:31.521 --> 33:32.354
Open, Mom.

33:33.922 --> 33:35.458
Mom, open.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.427
Yeah, all she ever
wanted was a home.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.328
Well, I'll certainly
try to give her one.

33:39.361 --> 33:40.730
I know you will, Bruce.

33:40.764 --> 33:42.030
Where are you gonna live?
Albany.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.899
Albany, huh? You got a
family up there then?

33:43.932 --> 33:45.435
No, just my mother.

33:45.468 --> 33:46.636
Just your mother, huh?

33:46.669 --> 33:47.936
Oh, you're gonna live
with your mother?

33:47.970 --> 33:50.172
Well, just for the first year.

33:50.205 --> 33:51.373
Oh, well that will be nice.

33:51.408 --> 33:52.675
Yes, yes.

33:52.709 --> 33:54.042
A home with mother.

33:54.076 --> 33:54.910
In Albany too.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.368
I hear you, man.

34:19.402 --> 34:20.703
I hear you.

34:20.737 --> 34:24.741
Did you know I lived at
home most of my life?

34:24.774 --> 34:26.275
Yeah, it was tough.

34:26.308 --> 34:28.645
And especially when you
have parents like mine.

34:29.846 --> 34:31.548
Like you know the type, right?

34:31.581 --> 34:33.949
Overbearing and demanding,

34:33.982 --> 34:35.585
nothing's ever good enough.

34:36.753 --> 34:37.887
My mom...

34:38.788 --> 34:41.190
I love her, but she was
a battle ax, I tell you.

34:42.425 --> 34:44.661
She used to spank me so hard.

34:46.228 --> 34:47.831
One time she spanked me so hard

34:48.698 --> 34:50.332
I threw up on the carpet.

34:51.568 --> 34:54.504
And it was unbelievable what
they got away with back then.

34:54.537 --> 34:55.472
Amen, brother.

34:56.439 --> 34:57.740
It's a wonder I didn't turn out

34:57.774 --> 35:00.275
to be some sort of
disturbed maniac.

35:01.678 --> 35:02.612
Anyway, listen.

35:02.645 --> 35:05.415
I am just totally
rambling on over here.

35:06.749 --> 35:09.151
What were your parents like?

35:09.184 --> 35:11.286
My dad was a jazz musician.

35:12.154 --> 35:14.424
He died 10 years ago

35:14.457 --> 35:16.258
and I've been taking
care of my mom

35:16.291 --> 35:17.727
with dementia ever since.

35:18.761 --> 35:19.596
No kidding?

35:21.029 --> 35:24.233
Moms are so interesting,
aren't they?

35:24.266 --> 35:27.102
But it sounds like you
got one of the good ones.

35:27.135 --> 35:29.439
You're luckier than
the rest of us.

35:29.472 --> 35:32.274
Well, I mean, she
was a lot better

35:32.307 --> 35:34.444
before her mind went.
Yeah. Yeah.

35:34.477 --> 35:36.713
But she's always been
pretty hard on me.

35:36.746 --> 35:38.381
Tell me more about that.

35:39.616 --> 35:42.452
I mean, sometimes
it was the switch.

35:43.753 --> 35:45.053
Sometimes it was a belt.

35:46.723 --> 35:48.958
But mostly it was
just with words.

35:52.060 --> 35:52.896
Mm-hmm.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.134
I'm sorry about that.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.103
Anyway, you were saying.

36:01.136 --> 36:02.472
Uh.

36:11.781 --> 36:13.449
I'm so sorry about that.

36:13.483 --> 36:14.283
Don't worry. It's fine.

36:14.316 --> 36:15.785
They can try later.

36:15.818 --> 36:18.186
I wonder why they
keep interrupting us?

36:18.220 --> 36:19.187
But please, please.

36:21.024 --> 36:22.759
One time I got in trouble

36:22.792 --> 36:25.828
for breaking a fresh
carton of eggs.

36:26.996 --> 36:29.097
Mom hit me so hard
with a yardstick

36:29.131 --> 36:32.802
that it snapped in
half, broke the skin.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.369
Oh, wow.

36:36.406 --> 36:38.140
That sounds like
a tough time, pal.

36:39.107 --> 36:40.977
I'm sorry to hear about that.

36:41.010 --> 36:41.844
Thanks.

36:42.979 --> 36:45.415
Hey, now I don't know about you

36:45.448 --> 36:47.182
but this is really
bumming me out.

36:47.215 --> 36:50.653
So, how about we talk
about something fun?

36:50.687 --> 36:54.624
Okay, do you have a girlfriend?

36:55.992 --> 36:56.826
Oh.

36:57.927 --> 36:59.328
Oh.

36:59.361 --> 37:01.129
Ah, shoot. I'm sorry, man.

37:01.163 --> 37:02.732
I shouldn't have brought it up.

37:02.765 --> 37:03.600
No, no.

37:04.901 --> 37:06.469
I just, I've been doing this

37:06.502 --> 37:11.474
video dating service
for like six months

37:11.841 --> 37:13.910
and I finally got a match today

37:15.912 --> 37:17.046
but I fucked it up.

37:19.048 --> 37:20.817
You know, I can relate to that.

37:20.850 --> 37:22.184
I really can.

37:24.754 --> 37:28.658
Okay, so one time I had a
blind date all lined up.

37:28.691 --> 37:30.693
It was for my senior prom.

37:30.727 --> 37:33.128
So, my buddy and I are going

37:33.161 --> 37:35.230
to pick them up at
a friend's house.

37:36.065 --> 37:37.667
You know what happened?

37:37.700 --> 37:41.169
The girl tells me she's sick

37:41.203 --> 37:43.039
and she has to skip the dance.

37:44.407 --> 37:45.541
So I had to go by myself.

37:45.575 --> 37:46.442
But it's fine.

37:46.476 --> 37:49.177
Like, I don't mind being lonely.

37:50.079 --> 37:51.114
I mean, it's not like I'm gonna

37:51.146 --> 37:52.982
be alone forever or
something, right?

37:54.784 --> 37:56.284
So here I am.

37:56.318 --> 38:01.323
I'm at this stupid prom
alone, standing in the back

38:02.925 --> 38:07.930
and who do I see dancing
with Curtis Millegan?

38:09.599 --> 38:10.400
Who?

38:10.433 --> 38:12.802
My date!

38:12.835 --> 38:13.636
Ugh!

38:13.670 --> 38:15.104
That lying hag!

38:15.138 --> 38:17.205
It was unbelievable.

38:17.239 --> 38:18.474
Do you know what I did next?

38:18.508 --> 38:19.307
What?

38:19.341 --> 38:21.309
Good guess, but no.

38:22.177 --> 38:25.715
I blew my fucking top at her.

38:25.748 --> 38:29.251
Like in front of everyone.

38:29.284 --> 38:31.521
I was yelling so loud

38:31.554 --> 38:33.589
they had to stop the music

38:33.623 --> 38:36.291
and bring in the chaperones.

38:36.324 --> 38:37.259
Whoa.

38:37.292 --> 38:39.929
My buddy had to come
over and calm me down

38:39.962 --> 38:41.731
before I started hitting people.

38:42.598 --> 38:44.100
It was unreal.

38:45.535 --> 38:47.235
But my friend said
something to me that night

38:47.269 --> 38:48.671
that I'll never forget.

38:49.806 --> 38:53.776
He said, "Andy, my man,
you didn't miss out

38:53.810 --> 38:55.343
on a date with her.

38:55.378 --> 38:58.114
She missed out on
a date with you.

38:58.147 --> 38:59.916
So forget about her.

38:59.949 --> 39:03.386
You are entitled to
the things you want."

39:04.654 --> 39:05.988
He straightened my collar,

39:06.022 --> 39:07.857
he patted me on the shoulder,

39:07.890 --> 39:09.058
and we ended up having

39:09.092 --> 39:12.962
one of the most fun nights
of our lives together.

39:12.995 --> 39:15.698
Dancing and drinking,
just going crazy.

39:15.732 --> 39:17.767
Oh man, it was great.

39:18.701 --> 39:22.405
Besides, I got what I
wanted from her eventually.

39:22.438 --> 39:24.107
So everything worked out.

39:25.641 --> 39:27.877
Anyway, after that night

39:27.910 --> 39:30.046
I'm always reminded of my friend

39:30.079 --> 39:31.581
and how he was there for me

39:31.614 --> 39:32.849
when I was down and out.

39:34.584 --> 39:36.318
That's what friends are for.

39:37.252 --> 39:38.921
To be there for each other

39:38.955 --> 39:40.590
when all the chips are down.

39:42.058 --> 39:43.893
And that's why I'm
here for you, pal.

39:45.228 --> 39:46.596
It reminds me of a saying.

39:47.764 --> 39:50.833
Sometimes you don't
realize your own strength

39:50.867 --> 39:54.637
until you come face to face
with your greatest weakness.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.339
So forget that girl.

39:58.373 --> 39:59.575
We don't need her.

39:59.609 --> 40:01.511
We have each other.

40:01.544 --> 40:03.913
Now let's have a good time.

40:03.946 --> 40:05.481
How about a drink?

40:05.515 --> 40:06.549
All right.

40:14.524 --> 40:16.358
To friendship.

40:16.392 --> 40:17.193
To friendship.

40:33.376 --> 40:35.244
Hi! I'm Andy.

40:35.278 --> 40:36.779
Thanks for being here today.

40:36.813 --> 40:38.414
Well, let's cut to the chase.

40:38.447 --> 40:40.516
I'm here to be your friend.

40:40.550 --> 40:41.784
How's that sound?

40:41.818 --> 40:44.554
Sounds wonderful, Andy.

40:44.587 --> 40:48.090
So, um, what's your name?

40:48.124 --> 40:49.592
Nice to meet you, Andy.

40:49.625 --> 40:51.093
I'm David.

40:51.127 --> 40:52.428
Yeah.

40:52.461 --> 40:55.898
You know, your face,
your face just says that.

40:55.932 --> 40:57.233
Whoa.

40:57.266 --> 41:00.303
Hey, nice digs.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.138
Did you decorate
everything yourself?

41:03.005 --> 41:04.640
I hear you, man.

41:04.674 --> 41:06.108
I hear you.

41:06.142 --> 41:08.377
And especially when you
have parents like mine.

41:08.411 --> 41:11.013
You know this type.

41:11.047 --> 41:13.583
Overbearing, demanding.

41:13.616 --> 41:15.885
Nothing's ever good enough.

41:15.918 --> 41:17.787
Well, what next?

41:17.820 --> 41:19.455
Well, what do you say to a game?

41:19.488 --> 41:20.923
Yeah.

41:20.957 --> 41:22.625
Um, how about-

41:24.327 --> 41:26.128
Go Fish.
How about Go Fish?

41:26.162 --> 41:28.097
This'll be fun, I promise.

41:28.130 --> 41:29.332
I've got just the thing.

41:29.364 --> 41:31.467
I'll tell you my best joke.

41:32.969 --> 41:35.104
Stop me if you heard this one.

41:35.137 --> 41:38.507
An old man goes to the
doctor for some tests.

41:38.541 --> 41:40.343
Do you have any fours?

41:41.310 --> 41:43.512
No, go fish.

41:43.546 --> 41:45.414
All right!

41:45.448 --> 41:47.216
All right, one's
better than nothing.

41:48.684 --> 41:49.485
Okay, your turn.

41:49.518 --> 41:51.120
He gets the results.

41:51.153 --> 41:53.623
The doctor tells him
that he has bad news.

41:53.656 --> 41:55.324
Do you have any fives?

41:56.726 --> 41:58.160
No. Sorry.

41:58.194 --> 41:59.262
Go fish.

41:59.295 --> 42:02.598
The old man says, "Just give
it to me straight, Doc."

42:02.632 --> 42:04.200
Two sevens!

42:04.233 --> 42:05.034
All right!

42:05.067 --> 42:07.270
It must be my lucky day.

42:07.303 --> 42:12.041
The doctor says,
"Well, you have cancer

42:12.074 --> 42:14.076
and you have Alzheimer's."

42:14.110 --> 42:17.914
The old man says, "I
guess it could be worse.

42:17.947 --> 42:19.315
I could have cancer."

42:23.920 --> 42:25.054
Hold on.

42:25.087 --> 42:25.888
Hold on. Hold on.

42:25.922 --> 42:27.890
We are having way too much fun.

42:31.627 --> 42:32.595
Sorry about that.

42:32.628 --> 42:34.497
I have to commemorate
it with a photo.

42:34.530 --> 42:36.065
To friendship.

42:36.098 --> 42:37.199
To friendship.

42:37.233 --> 42:39.568
Nothing like a little friendly
competition, right pal?

42:39.602 --> 42:40.569
That's right, pal.

42:40.603 --> 42:42.138
To friendship.

42:42.171 --> 42:43.005
To friendship.

42:44.307 --> 42:45.841
You ready?

42:45.875 --> 42:46.709
To friendship.

42:47.843 --> 42:48.811
To friendship.

42:48.844 --> 42:49.979
Wow!

42:51.381 --> 42:54.183
Ugh, I can't wait to
see how it turns out.

42:54.216 --> 42:55.217
I don't believe you!

42:55.251 --> 42:56.285
I don't believe you!

42:56.319 --> 42:57.286
I don't believe you!

42:57.320 --> 42:58.422
I don't believe you!

42:58.454 --> 43:00.790
Man, they always say friendships
are full of surprises

43:00.823 --> 43:02.024
but, boy, that one,

43:02.058 --> 43:04.493
that really really
took me by surprise.

43:04.527 --> 43:05.761
I'll tell you what,

43:05.795 --> 43:07.431
I bet you're full of surprises.

43:07.463 --> 43:09.131
Hi! I'm Andy.

43:09.165 --> 43:10.299
I'll tell you what.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.634
Thanks for being here today.

43:11.667 --> 43:14.470
I bet you're full of
surprises, aren't you?

43:14.503 --> 43:15.972
Let's cut to the chase.

43:16.005 --> 43:18.107
I'm here to be your friend.

43:18.140 --> 43:19.443
How's that sound?

43:21.077 --> 43:22.845
To friendship.

43:22.878 --> 43:25.514
Nothing like a little friendly
competition, right pal?

43:25.548 --> 43:27.683
Overbearing, demanding,

43:27.717 --> 43:29.419
nothing's ever good enough.

43:29.453 --> 43:30.454
To friendship.

43:30.486 --> 43:31.287
To friendship.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.888
All right!
Yeah!

43:34.890 --> 43:35.958
Hold on.

43:35.992 --> 43:36.792
Hold on. Hold on.

43:36.826 --> 43:38.894
We are having way too much fun.

43:38.928 --> 43:41.030
I have to commemorate
it with a photo.

43:41.063 --> 43:42.898
I'm always reminded of my friend

43:42.932 --> 43:44.233
and how he was there for me

43:44.266 --> 43:45.901
when I was down and out.

43:46.802 --> 43:48.070
Okay, ready?

43:50.373 --> 43:51.774
That's what friends are for.

43:54.143 --> 43:56.746
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

43:56.779 --> 43:58.848
To be there for each other.

44:01.917 --> 44:02.952
When all the chips are down.

44:02.985 --> 44:04.388
Sorry about that.

44:04.421 --> 44:05.554
It's no wonder I didn't turn out

44:05.588 --> 44:07.391
some disturbed maniac.

44:07.424 --> 44:09.291
I wonder why they
keep interrupting us.

44:09.325 --> 44:11.293
That's why I'm
here for you, pal.

44:14.063 --> 44:15.064
Okay, ready?

44:17.333 --> 44:19.702
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

44:28.878 --> 44:29.979
This is great.

44:31.381 --> 44:32.548
Well, I've got an idea.

44:33.682 --> 44:36.152
How about you tell me

44:36.185 --> 44:38.921
the most embarrassing
story from your childhood?

44:38.954 --> 44:40.222
No, you don't wanna hear that.

44:40.256 --> 44:41.057
It's awful.

44:41.090 --> 44:42.426
Yes I do!

44:42.459 --> 44:43.559
Come on. Just tell me.

44:43.592 --> 44:44.394
No.
Please?

44:44.428 --> 44:46.128
No.

44:46.162 --> 44:48.631
No, thank you.
Please?

44:48.664 --> 44:49.899
Okay. Okay.

44:54.336 --> 44:55.237
It was sixth grade

44:56.372 --> 45:00.309
and there was this
girl I had a crush on.

45:02.578 --> 45:03.413
Jackie.

45:04.548 --> 45:05.881
She was so beautiful.

45:08.385 --> 45:13.355
Anyway, one day I decided
to write her a love note.

45:16.393 --> 45:17.793
I passed it to her in class.

45:21.030 --> 45:21.964
I guess she liked it

45:21.997 --> 45:25.134
because after she read it,

45:25.167 --> 45:28.505
she looked up at me and smiled.

45:31.541 --> 45:35.644
But a couple other kids
must've saw the exchange

45:35.678 --> 45:40.683
because they started
writing her notes too.

45:43.185 --> 45:46.155
I wanna kiss you all over.

45:47.056 --> 45:49.559
I wanna have sex with you.

45:49.593 --> 45:51.595
Let's make babies together.

45:53.530 --> 45:57.601
And they would sign
my name on the notes

45:57.633 --> 46:01.103
and then they'd slip
them into her cubby

46:01.137 --> 46:03.873
and into her lunchbox
and her homework.

46:06.675 --> 46:08.944
Then the notes got worse.

46:11.881 --> 46:14.183
I sneak into your room at night.

46:17.820 --> 46:20.390
I wanna sniff your panties.

46:23.659 --> 46:27.029
A teacher found one of the notes

46:29.064 --> 46:30.099
and I got in trouble.

46:33.202 --> 46:36.038
Jackie knew it wasn't me

46:39.041 --> 46:40.644
but she never spoke up about it.

46:43.712 --> 46:46.348
I got suspended for three days

46:46.383 --> 46:48.284
for inappropriate behavior.

46:50.152 --> 46:52.656
Mom wasn't too happy
about that one.

46:54.957 --> 46:58.595
I never even looked
at Jackie after that.

47:01.730 --> 47:06.436
Actually, I never
really talked to anyone

47:07.604 --> 47:08.605
after that happened.

47:11.373 --> 47:12.208
Wow.

47:13.309 --> 47:14.143
Pal.

47:16.446 --> 47:18.381
That's not embarrassing.

47:18.415 --> 47:19.748
It's not?

47:19.782 --> 47:22.151
No, it's fucking sad!

47:26.121 --> 47:27.122
All right now.

47:27.156 --> 47:27.957
All right, all right.

47:27.990 --> 47:29.992
I'm just giving you a hard time.

47:30.025 --> 47:31.661
Come on, friends do that.

47:32.629 --> 47:33.597
Come on.

47:33.630 --> 47:35.364
Come on. I was only joking.

47:35.398 --> 47:37.032
You're a dick sometimes.

47:37.900 --> 47:38.901
Wow.

47:39.935 --> 47:41.605
I don't believe you.

47:43.506 --> 47:46.208
Man, they always say friendships
are full of surprises.

47:46.242 --> 47:48.177
But, boy, I mean that one,

47:49.144 --> 47:52.382
that really really
took me by surprise.

47:53.650 --> 47:54.850
I'll tell you what.

47:55.884 --> 47:59.456
I bet you're full of
surprises, aren't you?

48:01.491 --> 48:06.496
But anyway, your story isn't
nearly as embarrassing as mine.

48:08.063 --> 48:10.299
I doubt it but go ahead.

48:10.332 --> 48:11.133
All right.

48:11.166 --> 48:12.101
All right.

48:13.436 --> 48:18.173
So, take yourself back to 1976.

48:21.378 --> 48:23.979
That's my freshman
year of college.

48:25.147 --> 48:28.050
I had a great dorm
room situation.

48:28.083 --> 48:30.587
My roommate and I
had our own rooms

48:30.620 --> 48:33.922
separated by a
bathroom in the middle.

48:33.956 --> 48:36.792
You know the kind with a
door at either end, right?

48:36.825 --> 48:41.830
Well, this meant we could
be loud in our rooms

48:43.165 --> 48:44.534
without disturbing each other.

48:44.567 --> 48:46.536
What, you mean like loud music?

48:47.903 --> 48:49.539
Not loud music, silly.

48:49.572 --> 48:51.206
Loud sex.

48:52.975 --> 48:55.578
We could pretty much be
as loud as we wanted.

48:57.414 --> 49:02.419
Well, fast forward
to when I met Pamela.

49:08.123 --> 49:09.358
Pamela.

49:09.392 --> 49:10.225
Pamela.

49:11.860 --> 49:14.196
Oh boy, was she something.

49:15.432 --> 49:18.802
She had a great ass.

49:18.834 --> 49:20.002
Yeah.

49:20.035 --> 49:21.705
Great tits.

49:22.739 --> 49:26.576
These big perfect lips.

49:28.445 --> 49:31.781
Well, we are in
my room one night

49:33.148 --> 49:36.720
and things are getting
pretty hot and heavy.

49:38.788 --> 49:43.793
So, there I am on
the edge of the bed.

49:45.395 --> 49:47.162
Pamela is straddling me.

49:49.198 --> 49:51.333
She's wearing black stockings

49:53.202 --> 49:55.270
and only black stockings.

49:58.307 --> 50:02.211
She slides me inside her.

50:06.549 --> 50:08.752
She starts slow at first.

50:10.919 --> 50:14.089
Starts moving up and
down on top of me.

50:15.625 --> 50:19.462
Her huge tits are
right in my face.

50:22.465 --> 50:24.601
I'm sure you can imagine.

50:24.634 --> 50:26.135
It was so hot.

50:27.604 --> 50:28.971
Yeah.

50:29.004 --> 50:30.573
She starts to go faster.

50:32.374 --> 50:35.612
Just bouncing up and
down on top of me.

50:37.447 --> 50:40.215
She kept asking, "Do
you like fucking me?"

50:41.384 --> 50:43.853
She is getting
louder and louder.

50:43.887 --> 50:45.722
"Fuck me, baby!

50:45.755 --> 50:47.490
Fuck me, baby!

50:48.625 --> 50:50.325
Fuck me, David!

50:50.359 --> 50:52.529
Fuck me, David!"

50:52.562 --> 50:55.899
And then suddenly,
out of nowhere, boom!

50:58.768 --> 50:59.569
Frank!

51:00.770 --> 51:02.872
Busted!
Mom, what are you doing?

51:02.906 --> 51:04.973
You were masturbating!

51:05.007 --> 51:06.576
Mom, you're supposed to knock!

51:06.609 --> 51:07.410
You should be

51:07.444 --> 51:08.545
ashamed of yourself!
Jerking off!

51:08.578 --> 51:10.647
Is that how you honor your wife?

51:10.680 --> 51:12.649
By indulging in self-pollution?

51:12.682 --> 51:14.851
I'm not-
You're disgusting, Frank!

51:14.884 --> 51:15.819
I'm David.

51:15.852 --> 51:17.720
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Frank.

51:17.754 --> 51:19.889
My name is David.

51:19.923 --> 51:22.859
That's why they call
you Filthy Frank!

51:22.892 --> 51:24.427
Frank is dead!

51:25.662 --> 51:27.996
Do you fucking hear me?

51:28.832 --> 51:33.268
He has been dead
for a long time!

51:33.302 --> 51:34.904
He killed himself!

51:34.938 --> 51:38.508
Don't you fucking
remember, stupid!

51:39.609 --> 51:41.744
He killed himself!

51:41.778 --> 51:45.849
My name is David!

51:45.882 --> 51:47.851
I'm your son

51:47.884 --> 51:51.955
and I'm all you have left.

51:51.987 --> 51:55.425
That was so fucked up.

51:55.458 --> 51:56.559
Frank is dead?

51:58.193 --> 51:59.027
Yes!

52:03.933 --> 52:04.834
Frank.

52:06.134 --> 52:06.936
Frank.

52:06.970 --> 52:08.972
No, no, no, no.
Frank.

52:09.004 --> 52:10.305
No no no no no, Mom.

52:10.339 --> 52:11.641
No no no, Mom.

52:11.674 --> 52:12.842
It's okay. It's okay.

52:12.876 --> 52:14.243
It's okay.

52:14.276 --> 52:15.678
It's okay.

52:15.712 --> 52:16.713
It's okay.

52:16.746 --> 52:17.714
It's okay.

52:17.747 --> 52:18.581
Shh.

52:19.849 --> 52:20.683
Shh.

52:21.584 --> 52:25.220
How could you
leave me like this?

52:25.254 --> 52:27.824
You promised you'd get help.

52:28.992 --> 52:30.560
He didn't leave.

52:30.593 --> 52:31.661
Frank's here.

52:31.694 --> 52:33.161
He's right here.

52:33.195 --> 52:34.898
He's always right here with us.

52:34.931 --> 52:35.765
Gay!

52:42.472 --> 52:43.305
He's fine.

52:43.338 --> 52:46.709
Frank, Frank's coming
back real soon.

52:46.743 --> 52:51.714
He's recording at
the studio today.

52:52.982 --> 52:56.118
Yeah, his new album
comes out in the spring

52:56.151 --> 52:59.087
and he's just got a
lot of work to do.

52:59.121 --> 53:00.723
Oh.

53:00.757 --> 53:01.925
I must have forgot.

53:01.958 --> 53:02.792
Yeah.

53:04.961 --> 53:05.962
It's his big debut.

53:08.464 --> 53:12.535
Everyone will finally
get to hear his music.

53:20.342 --> 53:21.310
David?

53:21.343 --> 53:23.513
Yes.

53:23.546 --> 53:24.614
It's me.

53:24.647 --> 53:26.449
I'm right here, Mom.

53:26.482 --> 53:28.918
I'll always be right here.

53:32.055 --> 53:32.922
David.
Yes?

53:36.559 --> 53:37.760
I soiled myself.

54:44.927 --> 54:46.228
This is David.

54:46.261 --> 54:47.430
Hi David.

54:47.463 --> 54:49.666
This is Diane from
Video Rendezvous.

54:49.699 --> 54:52.300
Oh, hi Diane.

54:52.334 --> 54:53.770
It's late.

54:53.803 --> 54:54.737
I'm so sorry.

54:54.771 --> 54:55.705
I'm working late.

54:55.738 --> 54:57.407
I didn't realize
what time it was.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.608
No, no.

54:58.641 --> 54:59.442
It's okay.

54:59.475 --> 55:01.144
What can I do for you?

55:01.176 --> 55:04.179
I wanted to let you know
that I heard from Lisa.

55:06.149 --> 55:07.249
You did?

55:07.282 --> 55:08.283
Get this.

55:08.316 --> 55:10.520
Turns out the person she
ended up matching with

55:10.553 --> 55:11.788
didn't work out.

55:11.821 --> 55:13.956
So I sent her your tape again.

55:14.857 --> 55:15.658
You did?

55:15.692 --> 55:17.860
Honestly, your
tape was terrible.

55:17.894 --> 55:20.496
But apparently the cameraman
had to do it twice?

55:21.464 --> 55:22.965
Yeah, that's right.

55:22.999 --> 55:23.966
Right.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.635
So I just went back
and used the first try.

55:25.668 --> 55:27.170
Too long but much better.

55:27.202 --> 55:31.407
Anyway, she watched it and well,
she can't wait to meet you.

55:31.441 --> 55:33.710
Are you available
Thursday evening?

55:33.743 --> 55:35.678
Um, yeah.

55:35.712 --> 55:37.814
I think I can make that work.

55:37.847 --> 55:38.648
Wonderful.

55:38.681 --> 55:40.450
You know the Skate
Land in Aurora?

55:40.483 --> 55:42.485
Be there at 7:00.

55:42.518 --> 55:43.519
Thank you, Diane.

55:43.553 --> 55:45.121
Thank you so much.

55:45.154 --> 55:47.190
It's my pleasure, David.

55:47.222 --> 55:48.524
Let me know how it goes.

55:58.534 --> 55:59.334
Yes!

56:43.345 --> 56:44.480
David?

56:44.514 --> 56:45.313
Lisa.

56:45.347 --> 56:46.549
Hi.
Hi.

56:46.582 --> 56:47.383
Nice to meet you.

56:47.416 --> 56:48.251
Yeah.

56:49.585 --> 56:50.553
Um, oh!

56:50.586 --> 56:51.554
This is for you.

56:51.587 --> 56:52.789
Oh, thank you!

56:53.656 --> 56:54.490
How sweet.

56:58.261 --> 56:59.729
Should we go inside or?

56:59.762 --> 57:01.063
Right.

57:01.097 --> 57:01.898
After you.

57:03.966 --> 57:05.034
Thank you.

57:17.914 --> 57:19.448
All right Skate Land.

57:30.159 --> 57:31.394
I liked your tape.

57:31.427 --> 57:32.662
Oh God.

57:32.695 --> 57:34.230
It was so awful.

57:34.263 --> 57:36.299
The camera guy
had me do it twice

57:36.331 --> 57:37.667
because I was just rambling on.

57:37.700 --> 57:40.036
I didn't think
you were rambling.

57:40.069 --> 57:42.438
You seemed nervous like
any other person would.

57:43.338 --> 57:44.440
It's a wonder people end up

57:44.473 --> 57:46.341
meeting from those things.

57:46.374 --> 57:50.179
It's so unnatural to be in
front of the camera like that.

57:50.213 --> 57:51.314
Maybe.

57:51.346 --> 57:52.882
But I like to think you get
a good sense of a person

57:52.915 --> 57:54.617
when they're
vulnerable like that.

57:55.785 --> 57:59.322
Well then you got a really
good sense of me then, huh?

57:59.354 --> 58:00.656
Yes.

58:00.690 --> 58:01.524
Yes, I did.

58:03.559 --> 58:04.493
Shall we?

58:04.527 --> 58:06.329
Okay.

58:06.361 --> 58:08.197
Well I'd say you've heard
enough of me blabbering.

58:08.231 --> 58:11.033
It's that special
time in the night.

58:11.067 --> 58:12.501
It's group skate time.

58:12.535 --> 58:15.571
Why don't you grab the hand of
that special someone tonight

58:15.605 --> 58:17.707
and lead them on out to the-

58:17.740 --> 58:19.374
Oh my God!

58:19.408 --> 58:23.946
"Well, you have
Alzheimer's and cancer."

58:23.980 --> 58:26.949
And the old man says
"Well, it could be worse.

58:26.983 --> 58:28.317
I could have cancer."

58:31.020 --> 58:32.488
Oh, that's great.

58:32.521 --> 58:33.923
Where did you hear that one?

58:33.956 --> 58:35.157
Just a friend of mine.

58:42.732 --> 58:44.200
Sorry.

58:44.233 --> 58:45.434
Just habit.

58:45.468 --> 58:47.670
I imagine it's from taking
care of your mother so well.

58:47.703 --> 58:50.506
Well, she has good days

58:50.539 --> 58:52.376
and she has bad days.

58:52.408 --> 58:54.610
But the scales
seem to be tipping

58:54.644 --> 58:55.945
to the bad days lately.

58:56.812 --> 58:57.914
How old is she again?

58:57.947 --> 58:58.748
73.

58:58.781 --> 58:59.582
Wow.

58:59.615 --> 59:01.217
Good for her.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.352
So, it's a full-time job then?

59:03.387 --> 59:04.553
Yeah.

59:04.587 --> 59:07.391
I basically have to stay with
her at home all the time.

59:08.758 --> 59:11.627
But we get enough from
social security to manage.

59:13.162 --> 59:15.064
And where is she tonight?

59:15.097 --> 59:16.599
The Senior Center.

59:16.632 --> 59:18.000
It's basically daycare.

59:19.302 --> 59:20.536
I have to take her there

59:20.569 --> 59:21.804
anytime I'm gonna be gone

59:21.837 --> 59:24.440
for longer than an hour or two.

59:24.473 --> 59:27.009
It makes it really hard
to get out and meet people

59:27.043 --> 59:29.345
because I can't afford
to do it very often.

59:30.212 --> 59:32.181
Well, it sounds like
you're doing your best

59:32.214 --> 59:33.482
which is all that matters.

59:34.450 --> 59:37.553
In my line of work I'm
constantly seeing much worse.

59:37.586 --> 59:40.122
Abuse, malnutrition.

59:40.156 --> 59:41.891
You'd be surprised how
many people get arrested

59:41.924 --> 59:43.259
for neglecting a loved one.

59:44.493 --> 59:46.095
I'm sure if things
were clear for her

59:46.128 --> 59:48.230
she'd be very thankful
to have you around.

59:49.465 --> 59:50.232
Thanks.

59:50.266 --> 59:51.634
I mean, I hope so.

59:52.501 --> 59:53.736
I just hope she's happy.

59:56.539 --> 59:58.174
I'm gonna need those tots back.

1:00:05.348 --> 1:00:06.482
So how are you?

1:00:06.515 --> 1:00:07.683
I'm okay.

1:00:07.717 --> 1:00:09.218
I'm just a little sore.

1:00:09.251 --> 1:00:10.052
Oh, no.

1:00:10.086 --> 1:00:13.656
I mean are you happy?

1:00:13.689 --> 1:00:15.257
Oh.

1:00:15.291 --> 1:00:18.060
Well, it's not about me.

1:00:18.094 --> 1:00:20.997
I mean, maybe someday
when she passes,

1:00:21.030 --> 1:00:23.132
but until then she's
my responsibility.

1:00:24.333 --> 1:00:26.602
But you could still be happy.

1:00:26.635 --> 1:00:27.703
Don't I seem happy?

1:00:28.971 --> 1:00:30.673
It may sound selfish to some

1:00:30.706 --> 1:00:33.142
but when someone has
to be a caregiver

1:00:33.175 --> 1:00:36.812
their lives go on hold,
you know, everything stops.

1:00:36.846 --> 1:00:38.047
And it's fine at first.

1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:39.782
They can handle it.

1:00:39.815 --> 1:00:43.387
But after long enough,
things can change.

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:44.754
On hold becomes the new normal

1:00:44.787 --> 1:00:49.258
and it's common for that
to turn into resentment.

1:00:49.291 --> 1:00:50.126
Resentment?

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:52.128
I don't resent her.

1:00:57.501 --> 1:00:58.768
Listen, David.

1:00:58.801 --> 1:01:00.202
I am not saying that you do.

1:01:01.203 --> 1:01:03.105
All I'm saying is
that everyone deserves

1:01:03.139 --> 1:01:05.374
a little time away from
their responsibilities.

1:01:05.409 --> 1:01:06.742
They deserve balance.

1:01:06.776 --> 1:01:08.711
They deserve the
things that they want.

1:01:09.612 --> 1:01:11.614
I'm sure she'd want
that for you, right?

1:01:12.615 --> 1:01:14.950
I've never really thought
about it like that.

1:01:16.185 --> 1:01:17.086
Balance?

1:01:18.587 --> 1:01:20.923
Balance just seems
impossible at this point.

1:01:23.427 --> 1:01:26.362
Well, maybe someone
will come around

1:01:26.396 --> 1:01:27.930
that can help you out a little.

1:01:30.232 --> 1:01:32.234
You just need to open
yourself up to it.

1:02:46.409 --> 1:02:48.344
You wanna hang out
tomorrow night?

1:02:48.378 --> 1:02:50.012
Absolutely.

1:02:50.045 --> 1:02:50.880
I'd love to.

1:02:55.385 --> 1:02:56.785
Oh, do you have a pen?

1:02:56.819 --> 1:02:57.720
Um, yeah.

1:03:01.558 --> 1:03:06.262
Thanks.

1:03:12.234 --> 1:03:14.003
Okay, thanks.

1:03:14.036 --> 1:03:14.837
All right.

1:03:14.870 --> 1:03:15.771
Bye.
Bye.

1:03:22.011 --> 1:03:22.845
Boom!

1:03:32.522 --> 1:03:34.023
Yes!

1:03:34.056 --> 1:03:34.890
Yes!

1:03:38.294 --> 1:03:39.462
Yes, yes, yes!

1:03:41.063 --> 1:03:42.198
Yes!

1:03:42.231 --> 1:03:43.065
Yes!

1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:45.468
Yes, yes, yes!

1:03:48.405 --> 1:03:49.606
Yeah!

1:03:52.041 --> 1:03:53.008
Yeah!

1:03:53.042 --> 1:03:53.876
Yes!

1:03:54.877 --> 1:03:55.711
Yeah!

1:03:56.745 --> 1:03:57.581
Yes!

1:04:15.764 --> 1:04:17.500
Wow, Mom.

1:04:19.569 --> 1:04:20.936
That's beautiful.

1:04:20.970 --> 1:04:22.771
That's going right
up on the fridge.

1:04:24.873 --> 1:04:25.709
Come on.

1:04:27.943 --> 1:04:29.945
All right, through here.

1:04:32.515 --> 1:04:34.417
Here we go. Here we go.

1:04:37.654 --> 1:04:38.488
All right.

1:04:39.522 --> 1:04:41.424
There's one foot.

1:04:41.458 --> 1:04:42.291
Two foot.

1:04:43.693 --> 1:04:44.893
And upsie daisy.

1:04:46.362 --> 1:04:47.597
I know, I know.

1:04:48.732 --> 1:04:50.400
There you go, Mamma.

1:05:05.649 --> 1:05:07.016
Aw.

1:05:07.049 --> 1:05:08.817
You're leaving?

1:05:08.851 --> 1:05:09.952
Okay.

1:05:09.985 --> 1:05:12.821
Well, I guess all good
times must come to.

1:05:15.291 --> 1:05:16.892
Come on, come on.

1:05:22.499 --> 1:05:24.033
All the juicy details.

1:05:29.506 --> 1:05:30.674
I have to know the story.

1:05:30.707 --> 1:05:33.042
Give me all the juicy details.

1:05:35.811 --> 1:05:40.816
Go on, go on.

1:05:46.389 --> 1:05:47.724
You have to tell me the story.

1:05:47.757 --> 1:05:51.226
I want all the juicy details.

1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:56.265
Go on, go on.

1:05:56.599 --> 1:05:57.933
You have to tell me the story.

1:05:57.966 --> 1:06:00.369
I want all the juicy details.

1:06:01.970 --> 1:06:03.038
Go on, go on.

1:06:07.309 --> 1:06:08.578
You have to tell me the story.

1:06:08.611 --> 1:06:10.145
I want all the juicy details.

1:06:10.179 --> 1:06:12.948
Andy, I had the most
incredible date.

1:06:12.981 --> 1:06:15.351
Her name was Lisa
and she's perfect!

1:06:15.385 --> 1:06:16.919
Go on, go on.

1:06:16.952 --> 1:06:19.188
She's cute and she's funny

1:06:19.221 --> 1:06:20.923
and she's a caregiver.

1:06:20.956 --> 1:06:23.225
She basically went to college

1:06:23.258 --> 1:06:26.295
to learn how to take
care of people like Mom.

1:06:26.328 --> 1:06:27.129
Oh, oh.

1:06:27.162 --> 1:06:29.998
We clicked immediately.

1:06:30.032 --> 1:06:33.570
She totally understands
my situation.

1:06:33.603 --> 1:06:34.604
She gets me.

1:06:36.673 --> 1:06:37.707
She gets you?

1:06:37.741 --> 1:06:38.575
Yeah.

1:06:39.576 --> 1:06:41.644
After one date, huh?

1:06:44.179 --> 1:06:46.750
Well, she must
really be something.

1:06:47.751 --> 1:06:49.151
Well, yeah.

1:06:49.184 --> 1:06:51.421
I mean, we have a lot in common.

1:06:51.454 --> 1:06:54.056
Like I can tell her anything.

1:06:54.089 --> 1:06:55.958
We've already made
plans for tomorrow.

1:06:55.991 --> 1:06:59.396
I mean, you just met this girl.

1:06:59.429 --> 1:07:01.564
Yeah, but she's like-

1:07:01.598 --> 1:07:05.702
So, so that's it then?

1:07:07.570 --> 1:07:09.773
There's no more you and me?

1:07:09.806 --> 1:07:10.807
No, Andy.

1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:12.074
That's not what I meant.

1:07:12.107 --> 1:07:14.176
I thought we could tell
each other everything.

1:07:15.612 --> 1:07:17.380
I thought we were best friends.

1:07:17.414 --> 1:07:18.782
We can.

1:07:18.815 --> 1:07:19.716
We are.

1:07:20.750 --> 1:07:25.755
I mean, what does she
have that I don't have?

1:07:26.255 --> 1:07:27.857
Well-

1:07:27.891 --> 1:07:29.392
Well, that shouldn't matter.

1:07:31.059 --> 1:07:35.432
Our friendship, our connection,

1:07:36.733 --> 1:07:38.967
like that's real, pal.

1:07:39.001 --> 1:07:40.537
That's as real as it gets.

1:07:47.142 --> 1:07:48.445
You expect me to believe

1:07:48.478 --> 1:07:51.681
that this girls knows
you better than I do?

1:07:51.714 --> 1:07:54.784
No, that's not what I meant.

1:07:54.818 --> 1:07:56.318
Don't be stupid.

1:07:57.454 --> 1:07:59.823
You're just drunk
with infatuation

1:07:59.856 --> 1:08:01.290
for some cute girl.

1:08:03.893 --> 1:08:05.528
She's clouding
your judgment, pal.

1:08:05.562 --> 1:08:08.832
But I thought friends could
tell each other anything?

1:08:08.865 --> 1:08:10.500
I am your friend.

1:08:10.533 --> 1:08:11.835
I care about you.

1:08:12.735 --> 1:08:15.971
I will always be there for you.

1:08:16.004 --> 1:08:17.707
Andy, that's not what I meant.

1:08:19.442 --> 1:08:21.210
Can't you see?

1:08:21.243 --> 1:08:23.746
She's already coming between us.

1:08:26.215 --> 1:08:27.584
Friends, remember?

1:08:28.984 --> 1:08:30.920
They have to be
there for each other

1:08:30.954 --> 1:08:31.788
no matter what.

1:08:34.223 --> 1:08:37.861
Plus, we had plans for tomorrow.

1:08:37.894 --> 1:08:38.728
We did?

1:08:39.629 --> 1:08:40.964
Oh, you forgot?

1:08:40.996 --> 1:08:41.831
Of course.

1:08:43.098 --> 1:08:44.467
We were gonna play cards.

1:08:46.636 --> 1:08:48.972
You said you wanted
to play Go Fish.

1:08:49.004 --> 1:08:51.306
I guess I did forget.

1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:52.140
It's fine.

1:08:52.174 --> 1:08:54.276
It's fine.

1:08:54.309 --> 1:08:55.143
Go on your date.

1:08:56.646 --> 1:08:58.781
This is obviously what's
more important to you anyway.

1:08:58.815 --> 1:08:59.616
No.

1:08:59.649 --> 1:09:00.550
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:00.583 --> 1:09:02.952
You are important to me, Andy.

1:09:02.986 --> 1:09:03.786
You are.

1:09:03.820 --> 1:09:05.320
I'm sorry.

1:09:05.354 --> 1:09:07.322
Hey, look, look.

1:09:07.356 --> 1:09:10.660
I'll call her tomorrow
and reschedule.

1:09:10.693 --> 1:09:12.862
Okay, I didn't realize
that we had plans.

1:09:12.896 --> 1:09:14.397
I made a mistake, okay?

1:09:16.900 --> 1:09:18.801
You would do that for me?

1:09:18.835 --> 1:09:20.703
I'd do anything
for my best friend.

1:09:23.606 --> 1:09:24.440
There he is.

1:09:26.843 --> 1:09:28.378
That's my guy.

1:09:28.411 --> 1:09:29.846
I'm really sorry.

1:09:33.181 --> 1:09:34.984
And I forgive you.

1:09:35.018 --> 1:09:35.852
Pals?

1:09:37.854 --> 1:09:38.988
Pals.

1:09:43.826 --> 1:09:45.428
Liability limitations

1:09:45.461 --> 1:09:47.430
from five million dollars cash.

1:09:47.463 --> 1:09:48.631
That means instead
of cutting off

1:09:48.665 --> 1:09:51.034
all debt on that combination.

1:09:51.066 --> 1:09:55.004
Don't even make
'em hard anymore.

1:09:55.038 --> 1:09:57.974
Insurance limit to 10 million.

1:10:59.802 --> 1:11:00.970
Hello?

1:11:01.004 --> 1:11:01.838
Lisa.

1:11:02.839 --> 1:11:04.874
Hi, it's David.

1:11:04.907 --> 1:11:06.208
Oh, hi.

1:11:06.241 --> 1:11:07.110
I'm so glad you called.

1:11:07.142 --> 1:11:11.346
Lisa, I'm really sorry but-

1:11:11.381 --> 1:11:12.214
What?

1:11:13.348 --> 1:11:15.485
I have to cancel our
plans for tonight.

1:11:15.518 --> 1:11:17.185
Oh.

1:11:17.219 --> 1:11:18.353
Is everything okay?

1:11:18.388 --> 1:11:19.389
Oh, yes.

1:11:19.422 --> 1:11:20.723
Everything's fine.

1:11:22.357 --> 1:11:23.191
It's just...

1:11:25.795 --> 1:11:27.362
Mom's just having a tough day

1:11:27.397 --> 1:11:32.402
and I don't think I
should leave her tonight.

1:11:32.502 --> 1:11:33.736
Do you want me to
come to your house?

1:11:33.770 --> 1:11:34.737
I'd be happy to help.

1:11:34.771 --> 1:11:36.039
No, no, no.

1:11:37.006 --> 1:11:38.574
That won't be necessary.

1:11:40.476 --> 1:11:42.310
She's pretty upset.

1:11:42.344 --> 1:11:45.782
So, I think a new face
might just confuse her,

1:11:45.815 --> 1:11:46.816
make it worse.

1:11:47.817 --> 1:11:50.153
Oh, well okay.

1:11:50.185 --> 1:11:51.821
I'm sorry.

1:11:51.854 --> 1:11:53.623
Can we reschedule for tomorrow?

1:11:54.657 --> 1:11:56.392
I have work tomorrow.
Maybe Saturday?

1:11:57.694 --> 1:11:58.528
Okay.

1:11:58.561 --> 1:11:59.595
That should be fine.

1:12:01.464 --> 1:12:02.665
I'm so sorry again.

1:12:03.666 --> 1:12:04.867
I understand.

1:12:04.901 --> 1:12:05.735
It's all right.

1:12:08.037 --> 1:12:10.073
Okay, I've gotta go now.

1:12:10.106 --> 1:12:11.140
All right.

1:12:11.174 --> 1:12:12.141
Bye David.

1:12:13.208 --> 1:12:15.111
Warm up with 50s and 60s and 70s

1:12:15.144 --> 1:12:16.913
and eventually we'll see
some of that warmer weather

1:12:16.946 --> 1:12:18.681
move back into the
southeast from the coast

1:12:18.715 --> 1:12:20.282
but it won't be around
for too much longer.

1:12:20.315 --> 1:12:21.451
Thank goodness.

1:12:21.484 --> 1:12:23.318
30s and 40s in the northern
Rockies to the northwest.

1:12:23.351 --> 1:12:25.388
60s and 70s in the southwest.

1:12:25.421 --> 1:12:26.823
Latest satellite news right now.

1:12:26.856 --> 1:12:27.790
Long Island is in the picture.

1:12:27.824 --> 1:12:29.826
You can see a nice day there.

1:12:29.859 --> 1:12:30.893
Shuffling the cards

1:12:31.828 --> 1:12:32.662
so it's fair.

1:12:33.730 --> 1:12:34.564
Okay.

1:12:39.301 --> 1:12:40.503
Hmm.

1:12:40.536 --> 1:12:42.705
Um, I think I'll go first.

1:12:45.575 --> 1:12:46.943
Hmm.

1:12:46.976 --> 1:12:49.712
Do you have any fours?

1:12:55.818 --> 1:12:56.652
All right!

1:12:57.687 --> 1:13:00.556
All right, one is
better than nothing.

1:13:00.590 --> 1:13:02.425
Okay, it's your turn.

1:13:02.458 --> 1:13:04.227
Do you have any tens?

1:13:05.928 --> 1:13:07.262
No.

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:08.798
Sorry, pal. Go fish.

1:13:12.602 --> 1:13:13.436
Hmm.

1:13:17.006 --> 1:13:18.808
Do you have any sevens?

1:13:20.643 --> 1:13:21.477
Two sevens!

1:13:22.378 --> 1:13:24.413
All right, it's must
be my lucky day!

1:13:28.350 --> 1:13:31.554
There's nothing like a
little friendly competition.

1:13:31.587 --> 1:13:32.522
Right, pal?

1:13:33.823 --> 1:13:34.657
Right, pal.

1:13:40.596 --> 1:13:42.932
This evening and goodnight.

1:13:42.965 --> 1:13:44.934
It's always nice to
have you with us on air.

1:13:44.967 --> 1:13:46.334
Goodnight.

1:13:46.368 --> 1:13:49.038
Hey Mom, can I get you
a snack before bed?

1:13:57.513 --> 1:13:58.381
Mom?

1:14:13.029 --> 1:14:18.034
Mom!

1:14:24.574 --> 1:14:27.643
Mom!

1:14:27.677 --> 1:14:28.978
No, no, no.

1:14:29.011 --> 1:14:29.946
No, no, no!

1:14:39.789 --> 1:14:41.190
Lucille!

1:14:41.224 --> 1:14:42.124
Mom!

1:14:42.158 --> 1:14:43.192
Mom, Mom!

1:14:43.226 --> 1:14:44.060
Lucille!

1:14:44.093 --> 1:14:45.194
Lucille!

1:14:45.228 --> 1:14:46.295
Lucille Glauer.

1:14:46.329 --> 1:14:47.396
Shit!

1:14:47.430 --> 1:14:48.965
Go, go, go!

1:14:48.998 --> 1:14:49.799
Go!

1:14:49.832 --> 1:14:51.868
Get the fuck out of the way.

1:14:51.901 --> 1:14:53.135
Stupid fuck!

1:14:54.337 --> 1:14:55.370
What are you gonna do, David?

1:14:55.404 --> 1:14:56.806
What are you gonna do?

1:15:02.411 --> 1:15:03.212
Stop!

1:15:03.246 --> 1:15:04.080
Stop!

1:15:05.047 --> 1:15:05.982
Fucking find her.

1:15:09.685 --> 1:15:10.519
Ah, shit.

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:19.528
911.

1:15:32.808 --> 1:15:33.609
Hello?

1:15:33.643 --> 1:15:34.777
Lisa.

1:15:34.810 --> 1:15:36.646
Lisa, it's David.

1:15:36.679 --> 1:15:37.813
David, I didn't expect-

1:15:37.847 --> 1:15:39.482
Lisa, I need your help.

1:15:39.515 --> 1:15:40.850
Oh no. What happened?

1:15:40.883 --> 1:15:42.184
She's missing.

1:15:42.218 --> 1:15:43.753
Mom's missing.

1:15:43.786 --> 1:15:45.655
She just wandered
out the front door.

1:15:45.688 --> 1:15:48.124
I only left her
alone for a minute.

1:15:48.157 --> 1:15:49.959
David, calm down.

1:15:49.992 --> 1:15:51.494
We're going to find her.

1:15:51.527 --> 1:15:52.762
Where are you?

1:15:58.067 --> 1:15:58.901
Sorry.

1:15:59.802 --> 1:16:00.870
I didn't wanna call the police.

1:16:00.903 --> 1:16:01.737
I didn't want them to-

1:16:01.771 --> 1:16:03.572
David, we're gonna
find her together.

1:16:03.606 --> 1:16:05.308
We just need to think about
where she might have gone.

1:16:05.341 --> 1:16:06.676
Have you checked
the Senior Center?

1:16:06.709 --> 1:16:07.710
I already checked.

1:16:08.711 --> 1:16:10.112
Okay.

1:16:10.146 --> 1:16:11.013
Okay.

1:16:11.047 --> 1:16:12.748
Um, well where else
did she use to go

1:16:12.782 --> 1:16:14.850
regularly when she was younger?

1:16:14.884 --> 1:16:15.718
Oh my god.

1:16:17.553 --> 1:16:18.388
That's it.

1:16:19.855 --> 1:16:20.690
Frank.

1:16:36.372 --> 1:16:37.707
Mom.

1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.475
Mom, what are you doin'?

1:16:39.508 --> 1:16:40.843
The bus is late.

1:16:41.978 --> 1:16:44.547
They're usually here at 6:00.

1:16:44.580 --> 1:16:45.415
Mom, Mom.

1:16:46.416 --> 1:16:48.284
You need to come
with us right now.

1:16:48.317 --> 1:16:52.588
Frank is playing a show
tonight at the Blue Bird.

1:16:52.621 --> 1:16:53.956
Now I'll be late.

1:16:53.990 --> 1:16:56.525
He'll hate if I'm late.

1:16:56.559 --> 1:16:57.526
Hi, Lucille.

1:16:57.560 --> 1:16:58.928
Are you waiting for the bus?

1:16:58.961 --> 1:17:01.230
No, I'm waiting for
the goddamn pope!

1:17:01.263 --> 1:17:02.832
What the hell does it look like?

1:17:02.865 --> 1:17:03.866
Lucille, the bus is late

1:17:03.899 --> 1:17:05.601
because it broke down
a few stops away.

1:17:05.634 --> 1:17:08.270
Can David and I give
you a ride instead?

1:17:08.304 --> 1:17:09.638
Uh.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:11.874
Yeah.

1:17:13.009 --> 1:17:16.278
I suppose that would be fine.

1:17:19.015 --> 1:17:19.815
All right.

1:17:19.849 --> 1:17:21.517
Let's stand up.

1:17:21.550 --> 1:17:26.555
You know the word
routine comes from route.

1:17:29.625 --> 1:17:33.829
You wouldn't know it though
from this shitty bus route.

1:17:33.863 --> 1:17:36.165
I know, I know.

1:17:36.198 --> 1:17:38.934
They look so pretty too.

1:17:38.968 --> 1:17:40.504
Do you have a date with Frank?

1:18:34.657 --> 1:18:36.292
Even 10 minutes is a long time

1:18:36.325 --> 1:18:37.326
to be away from you.

1:18:39.829 --> 1:18:41.565
Goodnight, Frank.

1:18:41.597 --> 1:18:42.432
It's...

1:18:44.468 --> 1:18:45.367
Sweet dreams, Mom.

1:18:56.580 --> 1:18:57.680
Can I get you a drink?

1:19:02.385 --> 1:19:03.453
Watch your step.

1:19:17.933 --> 1:19:19.902
Home sweet home.

1:19:19.935 --> 1:19:20.769
It's nice.

1:19:22.506 --> 1:19:23.339
It's very cozy.

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:26.742
It's a perfect
place to escape to.

1:19:30.580 --> 1:19:32.781
Didn't you say your
dad was a jazz player?

1:19:32.815 --> 1:19:34.183
Yes.

1:19:34.216 --> 1:19:35.017
Piano.

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:38.053
You wanna hear one of his tapes?

1:19:38.087 --> 1:19:39.054
Of course.

1:19:56.272 --> 1:19:58.174
This was always one
of my favorites.

1:20:00.410 --> 1:20:01.911
We played it at Dad's funeral.

1:20:03.946 --> 1:20:04.847
He's handsome.

1:20:06.982 --> 1:20:08.751
How long ago did he pass?

1:20:08.784 --> 1:20:09.952
Hmm.

1:20:09.985 --> 1:20:11.187
Almost 10 years now.

1:20:13.456 --> 1:20:14.924
Mom was much better back then.

1:20:27.604 --> 1:20:29.439
How about your folks?

1:20:29.472 --> 1:20:31.373
They live in Florida
with my sister.

1:20:32.841 --> 1:20:33.809
I came here to go to school

1:20:33.842 --> 1:20:36.946
and then I decided to
stay after I graduated.

1:20:38.113 --> 1:20:39.482
So you're all alone here?

1:20:40.716 --> 1:20:41.817
I wouldn't say that.

1:20:53.062 --> 1:20:56.031
I can't thank you enough
for all your help tonight.

1:20:56.065 --> 1:20:57.733
It's totally fine.

1:20:57.766 --> 1:20:59.001
I was happy to help.

1:20:59.969 --> 1:21:01.605
You were probably terrified.

1:21:01.638 --> 1:21:02.905
Yeah, I was.

1:21:05.174 --> 1:21:06.008
I'm better now.

1:21:12.314 --> 1:21:15.050
You know what my
dad used to say?

1:21:16.151 --> 1:21:19.088
Sometimes you don't
realize your own strength

1:21:20.022 --> 1:21:22.726
until you come face to face

1:21:22.758 --> 1:21:24.159
with your greatest weakness.

1:22:50.580 --> 1:22:51.414
Oh.

1:23:13.536 --> 1:23:15.705
I uh-

1:23:15.739 --> 1:23:17.172
David, what was that?

1:23:17.206 --> 1:23:18.240
I'm sorry.

1:23:18.273 --> 1:23:19.509
I just got excited and-

1:23:19.542 --> 1:23:20.909
No, no. The video.

1:23:22.311 --> 1:23:23.145
Oh.

1:23:24.079 --> 1:23:25.615
It's nothing.

1:23:25.648 --> 1:23:27.049
Was that from Video Rendezvous?

1:23:27.082 --> 1:23:27.883
I said it's nothing.

1:23:27.916 --> 1:23:29.452
Well, who was that creepy guy?

1:23:29.486 --> 1:23:31.388
He's no one, okay?

1:23:33.490 --> 1:23:34.758
He's no one.

1:23:37.092 --> 1:23:39.361
David, I don't understand
what you're saying.

1:23:39.396 --> 1:23:40.830
No, you wouldn't understand.

1:23:48.036 --> 1:23:48.904
I think I should go.

1:23:48.937 --> 1:23:50.339
Yeah, I think you should.

1:24:38.721 --> 1:24:43.426
Every year we took
Penny to the fair

1:24:43.460 --> 1:24:46.128
and we would give her a corn dog

1:24:48.665 --> 1:24:52.067
and then go on
that tilt-a-whirl.

1:24:56.773 --> 1:24:58.842
And she would always throw up.

1:25:04.246 --> 1:25:06.048
Hi, it's Lisa.

1:25:07.316 --> 1:25:08.918
If you're there, please pick up.

1:25:11.888 --> 1:25:13.556
I wanted to call and apologize.

1:25:15.123 --> 1:25:15.959
Frank.

1:25:17.059 --> 1:25:19.261
That's nice.

1:25:19.294 --> 1:25:20.830
That's nice.

1:25:20.864 --> 1:25:22.665
I'm not really sure what for

1:25:22.699 --> 1:25:24.366
but I just...

1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:26.301
I thought things were
going really well

1:25:27.637 --> 1:25:30.974
and I just hoped we
could talk about it.

1:25:32.475 --> 1:25:34.777
It seems silly to
fight over some tape.

1:25:36.044 --> 1:25:36.880
Too bad.

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:38.915
Too bad.

1:25:40.483 --> 1:25:41.551
Too bad.

1:25:41.584 --> 1:25:43.386
I'd like to see you again.

1:25:43.419 --> 1:25:45.688
Maybe I can come by for dinner.

1:25:49.759 --> 1:25:51.828
Too bad. Too bad.

1:25:51.861 --> 1:25:52.896
Too bad. Too bad.

1:25:52.929 --> 1:25:54.597
Here they would build schools,

1:25:54.631 --> 1:25:57.266
educate their children, reclaim.

1:25:57.299 --> 1:25:58.535
Oh, come on rock.

1:25:58.568 --> 1:26:00.302
You've just gotta wake up.

1:26:00.335 --> 1:26:01.738
Come on. Come on!

1:26:03.706 --> 1:26:05.307
Oh, phooey.

1:26:05.340 --> 1:26:06.943
Oh, what's the use?

1:26:06.976 --> 1:26:09.879
Nobody is ever gonna believe
that I met a talking rock.

1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:13.683
Well, who cares anyway?
I've got better things to do

1:26:13.716 --> 1:26:16.519
than waste my time
talking to rude rocks.

1:27:27.155 --> 1:27:27.991
Andy?

1:27:31.394 --> 1:27:32.227
Andy?

1:27:36.633 --> 1:27:37.467
Andy.

1:28:05.094 --> 1:28:06.462
Where the fuck?

1:28:10.833 --> 1:28:11.834
Frank.

1:28:11.868 --> 1:28:13.803
Do we have any more tape?

1:28:25.014 --> 1:28:26.582
Frank, do we have any more tape?

1:28:26.616 --> 1:28:27.884
This stuff is useless.

1:28:27.917 --> 1:28:29.585
It must be expired.

1:29:08.157 --> 1:29:09.224
Good lord.

1:29:09.257 --> 1:29:10.493
Calm yourself.

1:29:10.526 --> 1:29:14.262
No sense getting upset
over a little tape.

1:29:16.231 --> 1:29:17.567
A little tape?

1:29:19.267 --> 1:29:20.436
A little tape?

1:29:23.706 --> 1:29:25.240
You

1:29:25.273 --> 1:29:26.109
fucking

1:29:27.643 --> 1:29:28.911
bitch!

1:29:33.549 --> 1:29:38.221
Do you have any idea what
you've taken from me?

1:29:40.223 --> 1:29:41.124
Everything!

1:29:42.558 --> 1:29:45.228
You've taken everything from me!

1:29:56.105 --> 1:29:56.973
Fuck!

1:29:57.006 --> 1:29:58.340
Fuck!

1:29:58.373 --> 1:29:59.642
Fuck!

1:29:59.675 --> 1:30:00.476
Fuck!

1:30:00.510 --> 1:30:02.912
Get the fuck out of the way!

1:30:02.945 --> 1:30:04.247
Andy!

1:30:04.279 --> 1:30:05.181
Andy!

1:30:10.453 --> 1:30:11.487
Help.

1:30:11.521 --> 1:30:13.256
Please, Andy.

1:30:13.288 --> 1:30:14.423
I need Andy.

1:30:16.459 --> 1:30:17.460
I need Andy.

1:30:19.796 --> 1:30:20.963
Andy!

1:30:20.997 --> 1:30:21.998
I need Andy!

1:30:23.399 --> 1:30:26.002
I don't know anyone named Andy.

1:30:26.035 --> 1:30:27.270
"Rent-a-Pal!"

1:30:27.302 --> 1:30:30.338
I need "Rent-a-Pal!"

1:30:30.372 --> 1:30:31.574
Hey, buddy!

1:30:31.607 --> 1:30:32.475
You better calm it down

1:30:32.508 --> 1:30:33.943
or we're gonna have
a real problem.

1:30:42.819 --> 1:30:47.423
I need a video
tape you sell here.

1:30:47.456 --> 1:30:50.693
It's called "Rent-a-Pal".

1:30:51.894 --> 1:30:55.464
Where can I find one?

1:31:19.021 --> 1:31:19.822
Please.

1:31:19.856 --> 1:31:21.924
Please, just take it.

1:31:21.958 --> 1:31:23.459
It's on the house.

1:31:25.328 --> 1:31:27.830
That's very generous of you.

1:31:55.691 --> 1:31:57.126
Come on. Come on.

1:31:58.294 --> 1:31:59.128
Come on.

1:32:00.730 --> 1:32:02.798
Hi. I'm Andy.

1:32:02.832 --> 1:32:04.233
Thanks for being here today.

1:32:05.234 --> 1:32:07.670
Well, let's cut to the chase.

1:32:08.905 --> 1:32:11.207
I'm here to be your friend.

1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:12.041
How does that sound?

1:32:12.074 --> 1:32:14.443
That sounds wonderful.

1:32:14.477 --> 1:32:17.313
Sounds absolutely
wonderful, Andy.

1:32:19.448 --> 1:32:20.249
Whoa.

1:32:21.217 --> 1:32:22.051
Whoa.

1:32:23.119 --> 1:32:25.821
Hey, nice digs.

1:32:25.855 --> 1:32:27.690
Did you decorate
everything yourself?

1:32:28.658 --> 1:32:30.526
Well, I'm excited.

1:32:30.559 --> 1:32:32.662
I mean I am really excited.

1:32:34.163 --> 1:32:36.365
I gotta be honest with you here.

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:38.567
I have been waiting
for this moment

1:32:38.601 --> 1:32:40.703
for what feels like forever.

1:32:41.804 --> 1:32:44.974
I mean, gosh, I
am just so pleased

1:32:45.007 --> 1:32:47.944
that you decided to take
this journey with me.

1:32:47.977 --> 1:32:49.879
We're going to get
to know each other.

1:32:49.912 --> 1:32:52.982
We're going to talk
about whatever you want.

1:32:53.015 --> 1:32:54.483
But more than anything,

1:32:54.517 --> 1:32:55.785
we're gonna have some fun

1:32:56.786 --> 1:32:59.989
and hopefully it's the start
of a beautiful relationship.

1:33:01.057 --> 1:33:02.658
What do you say?

1:33:02.692 --> 1:33:03.559
That's great.

1:33:03.592 --> 1:33:05.127
That's great.

1:33:05.161 --> 1:33:06.228
To friendship.

1:33:06.262 --> 1:33:07.697
To friendship.

1:33:07.730 --> 1:33:11.667
You, you have got
good taste, pal.

1:33:13.235 --> 1:33:14.503
I'm so glad you're here.

1:33:14.537 --> 1:33:15.705
I was terribly worried.

1:33:16.872 --> 1:33:18.408
Tell me more about that.

1:33:18.442 --> 1:33:21.777
My mother, she was confused.

1:33:21.811 --> 1:33:24.146
I'm so sorry.

1:33:25.915 --> 1:33:28.684
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

1:33:28.718 --> 1:33:29.518
Oh.

1:33:29.552 --> 1:33:30.387
Wow.

1:33:32.389 --> 1:33:34.323
Ah, that sounds like
a tough time, pal.

1:33:35.224 --> 1:33:37.126
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1:33:37.159 --> 1:33:38.294
You're not angry?

1:33:39.695 --> 1:33:41.197
That's what friends are for.

1:33:42.264 --> 1:33:44.166
To be there for each other

1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:45.601
when all the chips are down.

1:33:47.069 --> 1:33:48.938
And that's why I'm
here for you, pal.

1:33:50.940 --> 1:33:53.142
Hey, now I don't know about you,

1:33:53.175 --> 1:33:55.044
but this is really
bumming me out.

1:33:55.077 --> 1:33:58.382
So, how about we talk
about something else?

1:33:58.415 --> 1:33:59.383
Like what?

1:33:59.416 --> 1:34:01.350
Moms are so interesting,
aren't they?

1:34:03.919 --> 1:34:05.821
What do you mean?

1:34:05.855 --> 1:34:07.323
We don't need her.

1:34:07.356 --> 1:34:08.524
We have each other.

1:34:09.459 --> 1:34:12.762
Now, let's have a good time.

1:34:14.630 --> 1:34:16.232
What did you have in mind?

1:34:16.265 --> 1:34:17.967
Well, what do you say to a game?

1:34:31.247 --> 1:34:32.048
Frank.

1:34:33.749 --> 1:34:35.785
I've fallen.

1:34:48.197 --> 1:34:49.932
Look at your face.

1:34:51.033 --> 1:34:52.502
It's all smashed up.

1:34:57.139 --> 1:34:57.940
Here.

1:34:57.973 --> 1:34:59.376
Let me help you up.

1:35:01.277 --> 1:35:02.578
That a girl.

1:35:02.611 --> 1:35:03.447
Whoa.

1:35:09.351 --> 1:35:10.186
Frank.

1:35:12.456 --> 1:35:13.856
I wanna sit down.

1:35:26.368 --> 1:35:27.203
David?

1:35:30.039 --> 1:35:30.840
Mom.

1:35:41.585 --> 1:35:43.719
You know what I think?

1:35:43.752 --> 1:35:45.921
What, sweetie?

1:35:46.789 --> 1:35:50.025
You're the reason
Dad killed himself.

1:36:19.456 --> 1:36:20.990
Wow!

1:36:21.023 --> 1:36:22.691
I don't believe you!

1:36:23.826 --> 1:36:26.262
Man, they always say friendships
are full of surprises

1:36:26.295 --> 1:36:31.300
but, boy, that one really
really took me by surprise.

1:36:33.669 --> 1:36:35.237
I'll tell you what.

1:36:35.271 --> 1:36:38.974
I bet you're full of
surprises, aren't you?

1:36:42.111 --> 1:36:44.880
It reminds me of a saying.

1:36:44.914 --> 1:36:47.183
Sometimes you don't
realize your own strength

1:36:47.216 --> 1:36:52.221
until you come face to face
with your greatest weakness.

1:36:52.888 --> 1:36:54.424
Well, it's true.

1:36:54.457 --> 1:36:55.458
So forget that girl.

1:36:56.426 --> 1:36:57.760
We don't need her.

1:36:57.793 --> 1:36:59.261
We have each other.

1:36:59.295 --> 1:37:01.063
We have each other.

1:37:01.096 --> 1:37:02.064
It's okay, pal.

1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:05.435
It's all right.

1:37:05.468 --> 1:37:08.337
We don't need her, do we?

1:37:08.370 --> 1:37:10.072
No.
No, we don't.

1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:13.376
We don't need her.

1:37:13.410 --> 1:37:15.144
We have each other.

1:37:16.379 --> 1:37:17.947
You got what you wanted.

1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:20.816
Now we can forget
about her, okay?

1:37:23.687 --> 1:37:25.821
She didn't understand.

1:37:25.854 --> 1:37:27.156
It's not her fault.

1:37:28.157 --> 1:37:30.660
Most people don't
have what we have.

1:37:32.662 --> 1:37:33.563
But you know what?

1:37:35.432 --> 1:37:38.133
This, this moment,

1:37:41.538 --> 1:37:43.205
this is what friends are for.

1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:46.809
To be there for each other

1:37:46.842 --> 1:37:48.545
when all the chips are down.

1:37:50.779 --> 1:37:53.483
And that's why I'm
here for you, pal.

1:37:58.988 --> 1:38:01.491
But, I gotta be
honest with you here.

1:38:01.524 --> 1:38:04.026
I have been waiting
for this moment

1:38:04.059 --> 1:38:05.462
for what feels like forever.

1:38:07.263 --> 1:38:10.433
And, gosh, I am just so pleased

1:38:10.467 --> 1:38:13.403
that you decided to take
this journey with me.

1:38:13.436 --> 1:38:15.371
We're going to get
to know each other.

1:38:15.405 --> 1:38:18.173
We're going to talk
about whatever you want.

1:38:18.207 --> 1:38:20.009
But, more than anything.

1:38:20.042 --> 1:38:22.177
We're gonna have some fun.

1:38:22.211 --> 1:38:25.347
And hopefully it's the start
of a beautiful relationship.

1:38:26.383 --> 1:38:27.216
What do you say?

1:38:29.285 --> 1:38:31.220
Sounds fucking weird, Andy.

1:38:32.422 --> 1:38:33.523
David?

1:38:52.509 --> 1:38:53.342
Hi.

1:38:55.512 --> 1:38:56.345
Hi.

1:38:58.347 --> 1:38:59.848
Thanks for being here today.

1:39:00.849 --> 1:39:02.017
You got my message?

1:39:04.353 --> 1:39:07.590
I'm here to be your friend.

1:39:07.624 --> 1:39:08.924
How's that sound?

1:39:10.527 --> 1:39:12.429
I brought a lasagna
for your mom.

1:39:14.129 --> 1:39:15.532
I've got just the thing.

1:39:16.599 --> 1:39:18.300
I'll tell you my best joke.

1:39:19.636 --> 1:39:22.104
Stop me if you've
heard this one.

1:39:22.137 --> 1:39:24.006
David, what's, what's going on?

1:39:34.617 --> 1:39:36.952
David, what did you do?

1:39:36.985 --> 1:39:38.621
No, no, no, no, no.

1:39:38.655 --> 1:39:40.889
I know what you're
thinking and I know.

1:39:40.923 --> 1:39:43.058
But hey, this is a
little weird for me too.

1:39:43.092 --> 1:39:43.992
David, move!

1:39:44.026 --> 1:39:45.094
I've never done this before

1:39:45.127 --> 1:39:47.329
so it's totally new to me.

1:39:47.363 --> 1:39:48.698
It's new for both of us.

1:39:49.566 --> 1:39:50.633
But I guess that just means

1:39:50.667 --> 1:39:53.302
we're in this together, right?

1:39:53.335 --> 1:39:55.672
You've got my back
and I've got yours.

1:39:57.640 --> 1:39:58.608
All right.

1:39:58.641 --> 1:39:59.743
Let's just dive in.

1:39:59.776 --> 1:40:00.777
Stay away from me!

1:40:03.979 --> 1:40:06.315
You know, I lived at
home for most of my life.

1:40:07.282 --> 1:40:08.852
It was tough.

1:40:08.884 --> 1:40:10.520
Especially with
parents like mine.

1:40:13.222 --> 1:40:15.324
You know the type, right?

1:40:15.357 --> 1:40:17.727
Overbearing, demanding,

1:40:17.761 --> 1:40:19.662
nothing's ever good enough.

1:40:21.363 --> 1:40:22.499
It's a wonder I didn't turn out

1:40:22.532 --> 1:40:25.100
to be some sort of
disturbed maniac.

1:41:22.826 --> 1:41:24.661
Help!

1:41:24.694 --> 1:41:26.361
Someone please help!

1:41:28.130 --> 1:41:28.964
Help!

1:41:31.233 --> 1:41:32.167
Help, please!

1:41:32.201 --> 1:41:33.503
Someone call 911!

1:42:29.224 --> 1:42:30.994
Hi. I'm Andy.

1:42:31.026 --> 1:42:32.160
Thanks for being here today.

1:42:32.194 --> 1:42:33.396
Now let's have a good time.

1:42:33.429 --> 1:42:34.329
Let's cut to the chase.

1:42:34.363 --> 1:42:35.632
I'm here to be your friend.

1:42:35.665 --> 1:42:36.933
We're gonna have some fun.

1:42:36.966 --> 1:42:38.001
How's that sound?

1:42:38.033 --> 1:42:39.067
Whoa.

1:42:39.101 --> 1:42:41.704
I gotta be honest
with you. Nice digs.

1:42:41.738 --> 1:42:43.372
Wow! I guess it could be worse.

1:42:43.406 --> 1:42:44.908
I don't believe it!
I could have cancer.

1:42:44.941 --> 1:42:46.576
To friendship.

1:42:47.610 --> 1:42:48.945
Man, they always say friendships

1:42:48.978 --> 1:42:50.413
are full of surprises but, boy.

1:42:50.446 --> 1:42:51.548
But I guess that just means

1:42:51.581 --> 1:42:53.148
we're in this together, right?

1:42:53.181 --> 1:42:54.116
Really took me by surprise.

1:42:54.149 --> 1:42:56.084
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

1:42:56.118 --> 1:42:57.720
I'll tell you what.

1:42:57.754 --> 1:42:59.722
I bet you're full of
surprises, aren't you?

1:43:00.657 --> 1:43:02.224
When you come face to face.

1:43:02.257 --> 1:43:03.091
Nothing like a little
friendly competition.

1:43:03.125 --> 1:43:04.460
Greatest weakness.

1:43:06.295 --> 1:43:07.129
Aw.

1:43:08.363 --> 1:43:10.033
Aw, no, really?

1:43:11.366 --> 1:43:12.200
Right now?

1:43:14.069 --> 1:43:16.739
Aw, but we were
having so much fun.

1:43:16.773 --> 1:43:17.740
You're leaving?

1:43:20.476 --> 1:43:22.077
Oh.

1:43:22.110 --> 1:43:22.946
Okay.

1:43:24.614 --> 1:43:27.249
Well, I guess all good times

1:43:27.282 --> 1:43:28.283
must come to an end.

1:43:30.954 --> 1:43:31.921
Don't worry about me.

1:43:31.955 --> 1:43:32.989
I'll be fine.

1:43:37.827 --> 1:43:40.362
We sure had a great
time, didn't we?

1:43:44.132 --> 1:43:45.635
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1:43:47.971 --> 1:43:49.338
Right, I know.

1:43:51.273 --> 1:43:52.475
I know. You've gotta go.

1:43:54.242 --> 1:43:57.614
Well, it's been great.

1:43:59.882 --> 1:44:00.717
And hey,

1:44:01.751 --> 1:44:05.888
I'll always be right
here waiting for you.

1:44:09.626 --> 1:44:10.460
Take care

1:44:12.528 --> 1:44:14.764
and I'll be seeing you.

1:44:16.065 --> 1:44:17.165
So long, pal.

1:47:58.821 --> 1:47:59.889
Yeah.
