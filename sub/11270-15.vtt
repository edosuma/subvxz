WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:07.437
Yes, I'll tell him.

00:12.112 --> 00:16.490
Sam, I just had a conversation
with your date tonight.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.028
Bambi.

00:19.328 --> 00:22.329
She said she can't make it.
She's had an accident.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.248
You're kidding. What happened?

00:25.376 --> 00:27.702
She fell off her shoes.

00:34.428 --> 00:36.800
Gee, that's tough.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.967
That leaves me only two hours
to find another date.

00:40.601 --> 00:44.730
- Those are the breaks.
- Not to worry.

00:45.815 --> 00:47.013
The book!

00:47.150 --> 00:50.353
Cliff, I swear,
it just gave off a beam of light.

00:50.987 --> 00:52.695
- A little black book?
- Yeah.

00:52.823 --> 00:56.192
Didn't those go out with getting
a girl drunk and seducing her?

00:56.326 --> 00:57.821
That's out now?

00:59.830 --> 01:02.500
Let me see.

01:03.292 --> 01:04.751
Christie Leveroni.

01:04.876 --> 01:07.451
Christie Leveroni, come on down!

01:08.423 --> 01:10.748
Come on, Sam, let me dial this one.

01:10.884 --> 01:14.549
It's been a long time since I've run
my fingers over a girl's digits.

01:14.679 --> 01:15.675
Norman.

01:15.806 --> 01:19.471
You know, I haven't seen Christie
since Woodstock.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.437
- You were at Woodstock?
- A friend told me to go there.

01:22.563 --> 01:24.888
Said it was a great place
to pick up chicks.

01:25.024 --> 01:27.693
I should have known
you weren't there for the music.

01:27.819 --> 01:29.728
There was music at Woodstock?

01:30.613 --> 01:32.820
Sammy, it's ringing.

01:33.491 --> 01:35.780
Hello. Is Christie there?

01:37.412 --> 01:39.120
She entered a convent?

01:41.583 --> 01:44.703
Boys, it looks like
your idol has fallen.

01:44.837 --> 01:47.162
So what's the number over there?

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

03:07.092 --> 03:09.001
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi, Diane.

03:09.136 --> 03:10.761
Hey, Coach.

03:11.722 --> 03:14.260
Sam. Look at me.

03:14.392 --> 03:16.468
- Do I look OK to you?
- Yeah, why?

03:16.602 --> 03:19.093
I just went
to renew my driver's licence.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.104
They asked me
to donate my kidneys.

03:21.232 --> 03:26.191
No, don't take that personal, Coach.
They ask everybody.

03:26.321 --> 03:29.856
Those highway robbers.
It used to be a lousy two bucks.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.077
- Carla's late again.
- Yeah, I know. I wonder why.

03:35.164 --> 03:38.200
Sam, you know why.

03:38.334 --> 03:41.584
Why aren't any of us saying anything
about Carla's problem?

03:41.713 --> 03:44.465
I don't think we should be
the ones to bring this up.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.133
You know Carla, she's proud.

03:46.259 --> 03:49.675
Maybe she just wants to keep
this one under her hat, that's all.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.725
Maybe it's not even
what we think it is.

03:59.398 --> 04:03.147
- Coach, what else could it be?
- Gas?

04:05.738 --> 04:08.360
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Carla.

04:12.037 --> 04:14.528
- I got to go change.
- OK.

04:18.793 --> 04:20.586
What are we all so afraid of?

04:20.713 --> 04:24.165
We've known for well over a month
that Carla's...

04:24.300 --> 04:27.586
Let me be the first to say it aloud.
Carla is pregnant.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.263
That's it, Sam, it's out.

04:30.890 --> 04:36.230
Sam, she is all alone in the world.
She needs some support.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.980
She's probably waiting
for us to reach out.

04:40.109 --> 04:43.858
- You people call yourselves friends.
- Why don't you talk to her?

04:44.488 --> 04:50.942
Well, I would, but Carla's
never actually called me a friend,

04:51.079 --> 04:53.997
unless "doofus"
is a term of endearment.

04:56.251 --> 04:59.917
No, don't look at me.
Vera and I don't have any kids.

05:00.047 --> 05:02.253
I don't know anything
about the subject.

05:02.383 --> 05:04.589
How come you and Vera
never had any kids?

05:05.344 --> 05:07.966
- I can't, Coach.
- Gee, I'm sorry, Norm.

05:08.097 --> 05:10.220
I look at Vera... I just can't.

05:17.441 --> 05:19.599
- So how's it going, guys?
- Hi, Carla.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.935
This is...

05:24.740 --> 05:28.821
Look, Carla,
we just want you to know that...

05:28.953 --> 05:32.951
Well, if there's anything
you ever need, just ask us, OK?

05:33.082 --> 05:36.037
Well, since you
brought it up, Sam.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.043
Yeah, what?

05:38.171 --> 05:42.121
I'm going to need a couple
of hours off at the end of April.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.133
If you don't want to talk about it...

05:44.261 --> 05:47.298
No, it's OK. I told the father
about it yesterday.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.516
He's been out of town.
I just wanted to tell him first.

05:50.643 --> 05:53.680
Tell the rest of them.
I mean, they're dying to hear.

05:53.813 --> 05:56.055
- I'll go talk to them.
- Alright.

05:58.860 --> 06:01.778
What was I saying?
The weather is really...

06:01.905 --> 06:05.109
It's always just...
sort of beautiful.

06:05.242 --> 06:06.273
Everyone?

06:08.495 --> 06:12.659
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

06:12.792 --> 06:18.795
No! You're pregnant? Carla.
Well, why didn't you say anything?

06:18.923 --> 06:23.004
I've got a lot on my mind.
I can't remember everything.

06:23.136 --> 06:24.679
Sure. Busy girl.

06:24.805 --> 06:28.174
Congratulations.
Unless you don't want another kid.

06:28.308 --> 06:31.760
- Of course she wanted the kid.
- Sure I do.

06:31.896 --> 06:34.980
What penniless, unmarried
mother of four wouldn't?

06:35.107 --> 06:36.483
See what I mean?

06:36.609 --> 06:40.061
Don't worry about that. I'll give you
a little bump-up in pay.

06:40.196 --> 06:41.856
- Thanks, Sam.
- That's great.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.157
Carla gets a raise
for getting pregnant.

06:46.286 --> 06:49.157
I wonder what I have to do
to get a raise out of the boss.

06:49.289 --> 06:52.540
You could get a raise
out of the boss.

06:52.668 --> 06:55.753
So who's the father?
We want to know.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.878
You're about to see for yourselves.
He's coming in.

07:00.009 --> 07:02.880
I really got lucky this time, boy.

07:03.012 --> 07:07.390
He's a nice, responsible guy,
and he is going to support this kid.

07:07.517 --> 07:10.554
That's great.
You going to get married?

07:10.687 --> 07:13.807
Well, you know, actually
we probably would, Sam,

07:13.941 --> 07:17.310
except it goes against
my most cherished belief.

07:17.445 --> 07:20.150
Men are toe jam.

07:21.532 --> 07:22.647
Who is this guy?

07:25.203 --> 07:26.662
Marshall.

07:31.126 --> 07:35.206
- Marshall?
- Carla made love to a PhD from MlT?

07:35.339 --> 07:39.171
Look, guys, if you can't say it
in front of me, don't say it at all.

07:40.595 --> 07:42.172
No, Coach.

07:42.305 --> 07:46.054
Coach, Marshall is the father
of Carla's child.

07:47.310 --> 07:50.976
Marshall? I don't believe it,
and I believe everything.

07:52.607 --> 07:55.858
- How are you feeling, little mommy?
- I'll make a deal with you.

07:55.986 --> 07:57.813
You don't call me "little mommy",

07:57.947 --> 08:00.272
and I don't put your tongue
in the blender.

08:02.451 --> 08:05.369
- Come down and sit down here.
- Come on, Marshall.

08:05.496 --> 08:07.988
- Way to go.
- I'm so happy for you both.

08:08.124 --> 08:12.253
- Congratulations, Marshall.
- Congratulations, Dad.

08:13.422 --> 08:16.376
Why don't you have a seat,
little... Carla?

08:16.508 --> 08:17.504
Thank you.

08:17.634 --> 08:20.636
We have something to celebrate.
A little champagne.

08:20.763 --> 08:22.969
- A toast!
- Serve it up, boys.

08:23.099 --> 08:24.510
I'll get the glasses.

08:24.642 --> 08:27.928
By the way,
I recommend the Lamaze method.

08:28.062 --> 08:30.554
I've read about that
and it sounds wonderful.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.849
No, forget it.
I got my own method.

08:32.984 --> 08:36.150
Knock me out and wake me
when it's potty-trained.

08:40.576 --> 08:43.114
Let's make a toast.
Somebody make a toast.

08:43.245 --> 08:45.653
- Diane, make the toast.
- Alright.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.494
To the baby.

08:48.626 --> 08:52.956
With Marshall as the father,
it's sure to have brains.

08:53.089 --> 08:56.423
With Carla as the mother,
it's sure to have need for them.

08:57.260 --> 09:00.546
I'm kidding. What I mean is,

09:00.681 --> 09:03.967
to the baby and its luck
at having such wonderful parents.

09:04.101 --> 09:05.560
Hear, hear.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.052
What, what?

09:08.189 --> 09:11.938
I think I'd better just lie down
for a minute, alright?

09:12.068 --> 09:14.773
Would you all excuse me?
I'll be right back.

09:15.947 --> 09:18.735
I didn't even know
you and Carla were dating.

09:18.867 --> 09:22.782
Actually, Coach,
we just dated the one time.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.824
One time?

09:27.293 --> 09:28.752
Just once?

09:29.962 --> 09:31.540
It's a funny thing, too,

09:31.672 --> 09:35.670
because Carla wouldn't
give me a second look before that.

09:35.802 --> 09:37.380
Or since.

09:38.263 --> 09:41.513
But she sure was ready, willing
and able that night.

09:41.641 --> 09:43.468
She was a woman possessed.

09:43.602 --> 09:46.437
So the whole thing was her idea?

09:46.563 --> 09:48.603
Yes, I think you could say that.

09:48.732 --> 09:50.856
Not that I didn't enjoy myself,

09:50.985 --> 09:54.568
but I had no idea
this would be the result.

09:54.697 --> 09:58.944
I was so surprised
when she told me about it yesterday.

09:59.703 --> 10:04.531
Would you excuse me, Marshall?
I think I need to talk to Carla.

10:12.717 --> 10:15.089
- You clever girl, you.
- What?

10:15.219 --> 10:19.051
I know what you're up to,
you sly boots.

10:19.182 --> 10:21.851
Got to hand it to you, pretty smart.

10:21.976 --> 10:24.384
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

10:24.521 --> 10:28.186
Marshall's not the father
of that child.

10:28.317 --> 10:32.778
Maybe he is and maybe he isn't.

10:34.156 --> 10:37.656
Come on, Carla. You can tell me.

10:37.785 --> 10:40.739
I'm proud of you.
This shows real initiative.

10:42.207 --> 10:48.043
Well, since you already guessed,
you're right, he's not the father.

10:48.171 --> 10:49.666
I lied so he'd support it.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.423
What a great, great plan.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.926
Yeah, well, I hate
to sing my own praises.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.132
Well, don't sing your own praises.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.592
Why don't you hum
a few bars of this tune?

11:07.943 --> 11:09.437
<i>Carla, how could you?</i>

11:09.569 --> 11:12.357
Why don't you sit down
and let me talk for a change?

11:12.489 --> 11:13.770
Fine.

11:17.953 --> 11:21.239
I'd had a really rotten day.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.957
I got stiffed twice.

11:24.085 --> 11:27.668
Sam bawled me out for something.
You were here.

11:27.797 --> 11:30.205
I got soaked on the way home.

11:30.342 --> 11:33.094
By the time I got the kids
locked in their rooms,

11:33.220 --> 11:35.378
I had really had it.

11:37.641 --> 11:42.434
So I sat down at the kitchen table,
a bottle of Chianti.

11:43.773 --> 11:48.565
I just started thinking
about how rotten my whole life was...

11:50.071 --> 11:56.905
...when I saw his face
through the fog in the door window.

11:58.122 --> 12:01.573
- Who?
- Nick, my ex-husband.

12:04.170 --> 12:07.621
Besides everything else,
it was our anniversary.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.216
I see.

12:09.342 --> 12:13.007
But I was so down, I figured we could
just talk for a while, you know?

12:13.138 --> 12:15.214
So we were drinking

12:15.348 --> 12:19.512
and remembering
the couple of good times we had.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.970
It was the first laugh
I had all day.

12:23.107 --> 12:28.350
He was wearing
his black fishnet T-shirt.

12:32.492 --> 12:37.949
I could see his panther tattoo
through the little holes.

12:38.582 --> 12:41.120
No woman could resist.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.416
With the rain and everything
and the wine,

12:46.549 --> 12:48.541
I just got carried away.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.967
Carla, this is the man
you once referred to as "seepage".

12:56.977 --> 13:00.227
Sure, Nick's disgusting,

13:00.355 --> 13:03.356
but he knows this spot
on your earlobe.

13:03.484 --> 13:07.813
One nibble and you are
a heaving mound of flesh.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.197
I find that very hard to believe.

13:11.325 --> 13:12.820
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:12.952 --> 13:16.571
- Well, let me just show you.
- Carla, don't be ridiculous.

13:16.706 --> 13:18.035
Carla.

13:23.422 --> 13:26.292
Cliff, no, this isn't
what you think it is.

13:26.425 --> 13:30.174
No, it's OK.
I'm an '80s kind of a guy.

13:30.304 --> 13:33.673
- Seen all the right movies.
- Yes. Well, no.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.884
Cliff, you see, Carla and I

13:36.019 --> 13:40.017
were testing a fascinating
scientific hypothesis.

13:40.148 --> 13:41.263
Scientific.

13:41.983 --> 13:43.941
I like science.

13:44.361 --> 13:47.481
Step right this way.
Carla, show him.

13:52.161 --> 13:55.447
- Unbelievable.
- I didn't feel anything.

13:55.581 --> 13:58.748
Well, sometimes
there's a delayed reaction.

13:58.876 --> 14:02.625
- Maybe if both of you jumped on...
- Take a walk.

14:03.882 --> 14:08.509
Listen, if you need a <i>trois</i>
for that <i>ménage</i>, I'll be in the bar.

14:13.976 --> 14:17.808
Alright, let me see if
I have the decadence straight.

14:17.939 --> 14:20.893
When you discovered
you were pregnant,

14:21.025 --> 14:23.563
you purposely seduced Marshall

14:23.695 --> 14:25.901
because you assumed
that your husband

14:26.031 --> 14:29.863
would not assume responsibility
for the child.

14:29.993 --> 14:33.160
- Exactly.
- Depraved.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.571
Now, look here, Whitey.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.414
You know, you can talk,
but I got four kids,

14:39.545 --> 14:42.749
and I've been raising them alone
and it's been damned hard.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.373
I can't take it any more.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.294
Somebody is going to help me
ease my load a little bit this time,

14:49.431 --> 14:51.720
and I don't care
what I have to do to get it.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.520
Carla, it's wrong.

14:55.521 --> 14:59.353
I don't care.
And I don't care what you think.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.188
- What did you guys do to Cliff?
- What's the matter?

15:02.320 --> 15:05.107
We just had to pull him
off the wooden lndian.

15:10.412 --> 15:12.451
- Cliff.
- Yes?

15:13.248 --> 15:15.739
Yeah, Cliff. Sip. Beer. Sip, Cliff.

15:15.876 --> 15:19.708
Carla, do you know the story
of <i>The Tell</i>-<i>Tale Heart?</i>

15:19.839 --> 15:23.006
- Take a leap, Whitey.
- I'm going to tell it to you.

15:23.134 --> 15:25.625
A young man killed an old man.

15:25.762 --> 15:27.470
While carrying out the crime,

15:27.597 --> 15:33.268
he could hear his victim's
heart beating in fright. Ba-boom.

15:36.315 --> 15:38.806
He was very glad
when the man was dead

15:38.942 --> 15:40.852
and the awful sound stopped.

15:40.986 --> 15:45.115
Then he dismembered his victim
and buried him under the floorboards.

15:45.241 --> 15:50.318
Soon, he could hear a sound
coming up from the floor.

15:53.208 --> 15:57.122
Till he couldn't stand it any more.
Surely everyone heard it.

15:57.254 --> 16:00.290
Eventually,
guilt drove him totally insane.

16:00.424 --> 16:02.713
You can never escape
your conscience.

16:05.429 --> 16:08.715
OK! Tom, I've been cheating on you.

16:08.850 --> 16:12.515
You are a wonderful man
and I don't deserve you.

16:12.645 --> 16:15.184
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, darling.

16:25.576 --> 16:28.328
- ls this having any effect on you?
- None at all.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.992
Maybe you need bigger ba-booms.

16:36.421 --> 16:38.710
Diane, would you just
leave me alone?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.711
Carla, don't get upset.
Sit down with me.

16:42.719 --> 16:46.338
Thanks. So, how's it going, Dad?

16:46.473 --> 16:51.302
Great, I think I'm approaching
a state of euphoria.

16:52.730 --> 16:57.108
- Coach, could I have that beer?
- Absolutely, Marshall.

17:01.406 --> 17:05.867
Carla, what do you think
we should name the child?

17:06.494 --> 17:08.535
We got time for names, Marshall.

17:08.664 --> 17:11.071
The biggest argument
I ever had with my wife

17:11.208 --> 17:13.082
was over naming our daughter.

17:13.211 --> 17:15.617
She kept insisting on Lisa.

17:15.755 --> 17:18.044
I wanted to stick
with the original name.

17:18.174 --> 17:21.709
- What was that, Coach?
- Baby Girl Pantusso.

17:28.102 --> 17:30.807
You know, Carla,
I've been thinking.

17:30.938 --> 17:32.978
Tomorrow, I'm going
to go to my lawyer,

17:33.107 --> 17:35.432
and have a new will drawn up

17:35.568 --> 17:40.610
and all of your children will
be named as my beneficiaries.

17:44.119 --> 17:47.868
Gee, Marshall,
I never expected that.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.995
That's about the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done...

17:53.128 --> 17:56.961
Diane, would you just cut it out
with the stupid "ba-booms"?

17:57.592 --> 17:59.631
Carla, Diane's in the back room.

18:02.722 --> 18:04.715
Come on, we got to talk.

18:06.935 --> 18:08.975
You win. I'm going
to tell him the truth.

18:09.104 --> 18:13.054
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

18:13.192 --> 18:16.857
- She's going to tell him the truth.
- The truth about what?

18:18.781 --> 18:24.654
Sam, it's terrible. She lied.
The real father is her ex-husband.

18:26.122 --> 18:28.744
I don't believe this.
I mean, I know the guy.

18:28.875 --> 18:33.584
Her ex-husband is an insensitive,
macho pig with one thing on his mind.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.715
- Some women are attracted to that.
- Name one.

18:40.096 --> 18:41.839
Arlene Abrams.

18:43.391 --> 18:45.265
Angela Adams.

18:46.436 --> 18:49.722
- I'm going home.
- No, listen. Wait a minute.

18:50.732 --> 18:52.392
I'm going to talk to you first.

18:54.278 --> 18:56.983
Sit down. Now, look.

18:57.114 --> 19:00.898
Diane told me what's going on
and I just have to say something.

19:01.494 --> 19:06.322
Marshall, you and Carla have a chance
for some great happiness here.

19:06.457 --> 19:08.497
I don't think
you should throw it away.

19:08.626 --> 19:11.414
- Sam, you don't...
- Come on, let me say this.

19:13.089 --> 19:16.044
- Look at me, Marshall.
- Look at you?

19:16.176 --> 19:22.891
Yeah. Now, a lot of people
think that I've got a great life.

19:23.017 --> 19:27.394
But you have a... You can have
something that I don't have.

19:27.522 --> 19:30.725
You can have the love
and the warmth of a family.

19:30.859 --> 19:35.153
You know, if you don't marry Carla,
some lucky guy's going to.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.365
As a matter of fact, if you
don't marry Carla, I'm going to.

19:42.371 --> 19:44.245
I'm not going to marry her.

19:57.679 --> 20:01.807
- I got the veil in my locker.
- You understand that what...

20:02.851 --> 20:06.636
Get out of here. You're all toe jam.

20:21.747 --> 20:25.697
You know,
I just feel terrible about this.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.539
I guess she really did
want some help with this child.

20:28.671 --> 20:32.087
Yeah, she's barely getting by
just the way it is.

20:32.842 --> 20:37.054
Carla's probably never felt lonelier
than she does at this moment.

20:38.014 --> 20:41.181
Got any more of those
little yellow goldfish crackers?

20:41.309 --> 20:44.560
We don't have any crackers
that look like goldfish.

20:45.439 --> 20:47.681
What did I just eat?

20:48.609 --> 20:52.393
I wish I had the money so I could
take care of the kid myself.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.523
Me, too, Sam.

20:54.657 --> 20:58.655
Wait, I've got a wonderful idea.
We are always taking up collections

20:58.786 --> 21:01.538
for little league teams
and to give gifts to orphans.

21:01.665 --> 21:04.500
We are now going to take up
a collection to help Carla.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.629
I think Cheers
should adopt this child.

21:07.754 --> 21:10.043
You know,
that's not such a stupid idea.

21:10.174 --> 21:13.128
We could all take turns
doing things with the kid.

21:13.260 --> 21:15.300
- Right.
- I could teach him how to pitch.

21:15.429 --> 21:18.715
I could teach him how to hit
your pitches out of the ballpark.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.973
I'll do the kid's taxes.

21:22.187 --> 21:23.847
Coach, come here.

21:23.980 --> 21:27.350
Listen, everybody.
This is for Carla's kid.

21:27.484 --> 21:28.859
It's going to be our kid.

21:28.986 --> 21:31.358
I can teach it
how to slide into second base.

21:31.488 --> 21:33.565
You can't. Remember your back.

21:33.699 --> 21:37.282
- I can teach him how to swim.
- You're afraid of the water.

21:37.411 --> 21:40.199
Well, I can teach him
how to tie a Windsor knot.

21:40.331 --> 21:42.205
Why do you think you wear clip-ons?

21:42.333 --> 21:44.160
Well, I can just sit there.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.547
I'm going home.

21:48.673 --> 21:53.087
Carla, before you do,
we want you to take this from us.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.545
It's to help out with the kid.

21:55.681 --> 21:59.181
We'd kind of like it
to be our kid, too.

22:14.827 --> 22:17.744
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>

22:18.247 --> 22:22.375
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

22:22.502 --> 22:26.582
<i>And don't be afraid of the dark</i>

22:26.714 --> 22:28.043
Everybody, come on.

22:28.174 --> 22:36.005
<i>At the end of a storm</i>
<i>is a golden light</i>

22:36.141 --> 22:43.224
<i>And the sweet silver song of a lark</i>

22:43.983 --> 22:47.566
<i>Walk on through the wind</i>

22:48.321 --> 22:51.939
<i>Walk on through the rain</i>

22:52.075 --> 23:00.332
<i>Though your dreams</i>
<i>be tossed and blown</i>

23:00.459 --> 23:05.038
<i>Walk on, walk on</i>

23:05.172 --> 23:09.170
<i>With hope in your heart</i>

23:09.302 --> 23:17.595
<i>And you'll never walk alone</i>

23:18.896 --> 23:27.189
<i>You'll never walk alone</i>
