WEBVTT

01:31.508 --> 01:33.843
Please… help. I…

01:45.939 --> 01:48.608
You fucked up… your own suicide?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.277
Just kill me.

01:52.737 --> 01:53.822
Please.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.653
Oh, did you think I was gonna
put you out of your misery?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.827
Are you fuckin' stupid?

02:41.744 --> 02:45.039
I'm gonna make you fucking suffer.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.542
Little bitch.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.643
I'm gonna make everyone wish
they'd never met me.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.442
Then I'm gonna die
and go straight to hell.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.858
<i>Difficulty, Queen of Clubs.</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:39.904
<i>Game, Target.</i>

04:40.905 --> 04:43.616
<i>Please wait until the game commences.</i>

05:07.390 --> 05:08.933
Did you think I was dead?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.226
No.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.313
I knew that I would see you again.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.647
You're too strong to die.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.899
Strong, huh?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
You know, Kuina,

05:21.362 --> 05:23.990
I started wondering
if waiting for death might be easier.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.826
Yeah, I had similar thoughts.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.122
But at least we're both here now.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.917
Clubs are team games.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.962
It should be much easier
with two of us playing.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.132
Just a few more games.
We'll make it to the end.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.968
Huh. Mmm. I'm sure we will.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.435
<i>Registration has closed.</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:54.645
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

07:09.053 --> 07:11.472
Don't go in!

10:40.222 --> 10:41.390
Hey!

10:44.977 --> 10:46.646
Fancy meeting you here.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.067
-Chishiya.
-There are only two games left.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.028
Players are starting to gather in Shibuya.

10:55.613 --> 10:59.241
I had a pretty good hunch
that you were probably still alive.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.585
What?

11:10.294 --> 11:12.004
Is that the only thing you've gotta say?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.048
So?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.633
Nothing. It's just…

11:16.676 --> 11:18.177
You're a lot less grumpy now.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.682
Oh, less grumpy, huh?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.394
Well, I've been through a hell of a lot.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.982
Hey, Arisu…

11:33.984 --> 11:35.945
can I share something with you

11:36.737 --> 11:38.572
that I've never told anyone before?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.537
Yeah.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.458
Well, I--

11:51.335 --> 11:52.169
Yo!

11:56.549 --> 11:58.426
I thought I'd never see you again!

11:58.509 --> 12:00.386
I am so fuckin' happy!

12:00.970 --> 12:02.138
Niragi!

12:02.847 --> 12:05.307
Did you mean to miss a vital organ?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.352
I didn't want to end things
with a surprise attack.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.063
So let's begin.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.315
It's a new murder game.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.154
Not like there's anything else
for the three of us to do here.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.490
You want to start a game
between players?

12:22.491 --> 12:24.410
The three of us are the same.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.122
Social outcasts. Losers.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.126
Yet we still want to know how it feels
to be alive, more than anyone.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.262
I don't have very much time left.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.223
Do me one last favor.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.934
One more game, come on!

12:49.018 --> 12:51.687
I thought you guys were my bros!

13:07.536 --> 13:08.913
Sounds like fun.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.208
Arisu, what do you think?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.793
What do you mean?

13:13.876 --> 13:17.463
Come on, don't play dumb.
I know you've got a bone to pick with me.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.548
We might as well deal with it right now.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.468
We can settle things once and for all.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.221
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:25.304 --> 13:28.057
Come on, where's your gun?
I know you got one!

13:29.767 --> 13:32.144
There's gotta be
another way to do this.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.908
Niragi! Stop this!

13:45.991 --> 13:47.827
I'm just acting like you guys.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.662
Doing whatever I feel like.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.873
Every time you open your mouths,
it's just to talk about yourselves.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.042
I've had to listen to your bullshit
the whole time.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.755
Stop acting like you're better than
everyone because you've seen people die.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.800
And don't say you're trying to survive
for someone else,

14:02.883 --> 14:05.636
because I know that deep down,
you're just as selfish!

14:05.719 --> 14:08.430
The only thing that matters
is that we come out on top!

14:10.558 --> 14:13.561
You said it'd all work out
if we worked together!

14:13.644 --> 14:16.647
From the very start,
you just wanted to be the only survivor!

14:16.730 --> 14:19.400
I don't want it to end this way!

14:19.483 --> 14:21.443
Please, or you'll kill everyone.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.695
Do it for them!

14:27.950 --> 14:28.868
Yeah.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.912
You might have a good point.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.085
Maybe we're all just supposed
to kill each other in this place.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.212
Now you're starting to make sense.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.384
Niragi…

14:47.636 --> 14:50.347
I know what you're trying to do,
but it won't work!

14:52.349 --> 14:53.934
You're trying to wear me down!

15:00.941 --> 15:01.942
Except…

15:03.903 --> 15:05.195
now it won't work.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.909
I'm not gonna act weak and selfish
ever again.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.212
I'm out.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.185
I'm not gonna pull this trigger
just so that I can survive.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.164
<i>I'm finally free.</i>

15:58.165 --> 16:00.125
I made my own choice.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.046
And based on my own ideals.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.424
It's all because of you.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.518
You ruined it.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.312
Thanks a lot, asshole.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.734
Arisu?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.869
What's going on here?

16:41.792 --> 16:44.837
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about you.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.465
Usagi!

16:48.549 --> 16:51.218
Stop shooting!
She's got nothing to do with this!

16:51.802 --> 16:54.847
Games need a heroine to rescue.
But this one should die.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.890
What are you saying?

16:58.517 --> 16:59.977
If I kill you now,

17:01.103 --> 17:03.605
everything can go back to the way it was.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.236
You… just get in the way.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.887
Chishiya!

17:36.013 --> 17:37.306
Chishiya!

17:37.389 --> 17:40.392
Chishiya! You saved me!

17:40.476 --> 17:42.478
Why did you do it?

17:43.604 --> 17:46.482
I wanted to do something
that was a bit out of character.

17:47.816 --> 17:51.195
I know it's thanks
to the people I met here.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.906
Like Kuzuryu.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.658
Arisu, too.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.788
Hey.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.749
Before, what were you gonna say?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.795
Oh, yeah.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.928
Honest people…

18:18.931 --> 18:21.308
always seemed pretty stupid to me.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.730
I've always loved messing with people

18:27.731 --> 18:29.441
who try too hard at life.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.904
I hated selflessness.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.868
It's probably because I was jealous.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.705
They all had something I was missing.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.501
It was like

18:48.168 --> 18:49.711
they could always see

18:50.546 --> 18:53.674
what a pathetic and small-minded person
I really was.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.595
I was always afraid.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.518
I get you.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.691
Yeah, I thought
you'd be the one to understand.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.450
I guess hunting rifles

19:21.034 --> 19:22.703
aren't as deadly as you thought.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.296
Whatever you do,

19:34.423 --> 19:36.508
just don't make me out to be the villain.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.598
If there were seven billion of me,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.310
you guys

19:46.810 --> 19:48.520
would all be villains too.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.861
You're pretty lucky, you know.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.157
You guys are the majority.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.536
Run.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.424
-Hide them under the cars.
-Okay.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.322
The only blimps left are the King
of Spades and the Queen of Hearts.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.575
Anybody who's left is gathering in Shibuya
now that they've seen the blimps.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.537
We can't go further until we take down
the King of Spades.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.082
Huh? Look!

21:37.796 --> 21:39.423
Kuina! Ann!

21:40.507 --> 21:42.134
Arisu!

21:48.682 --> 21:49.933
It's been a while.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.727
You're both okay. I'm so glad.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.395
It's good to see you again.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.063
Did Chishiya make it?

21:56.773 --> 21:57.691
Yeah.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.987
I saw him. He's good.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.822
Great.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.241
Looks like the King of Spades
wants to settle things here.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.201
We'll take the King down together.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.150
Ann!

22:43.403 --> 22:44.738
No! No!

23:30.075 --> 23:32.786
Yeah! We did it!

23:32.869 --> 23:34.204
-We got him!
-Finally!

23:34.287 --> 23:36.248
-We're finally free!
-Finally! Yeah!

23:37.416 --> 23:39.543
-We did it!
-Yeah!

24:17.205 --> 24:18.707
Arisu!

24:39.478 --> 24:40.729
Shit!

25:02.959 --> 25:04.878
-I keep missing. Fuck.
-Let's go!

25:16.598 --> 25:17.641
Arisu!

25:24.064 --> 25:25.607
Come on! They're in here!

25:32.572 --> 25:33.907
Arisu!

25:37.911 --> 25:39.204
Heya.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.623
Are you Usagi?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.375
Yeah.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.336
Good to meet you.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.218
He'll run out of ammo soon.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.220
Stay in here where there's cover.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.721
Aguni?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.891
Aguni. What are you doing here?

26:02.310 --> 26:03.770
I followed you here.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.690
So you do love me.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.905
He's just human.
He's not invincible.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.366
And as for his guns,

26:16.449 --> 26:18.159
he won't be able to shoot forever.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.997
Once he runs out of ammo,
he'll need to restock.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.207
I think they drop supplies
from the blimps.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.295
We've all got weapons.

26:37.470 --> 26:40.140
But this is all the ammo I've got left.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.532
I almost forgot.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.493
My good luck charm.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.370
This is the bomb Chishiya made.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.456
Chishiya?

27:05.248 --> 27:06.708
A lot of good that toy will do us.

27:06.791 --> 27:10.045
We can lure him in
and use it at close range.

27:11.171 --> 27:15.008
From the way it smells,
I'm guessing the bomb contains kerosene.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.593
An ANFO bomb.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.970
Then the explosion it makes
won't be that big.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.432
I can see a drugstore over there.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.559
If we can fill it up with gas,

27:25.143 --> 27:26.853
then the explosion will be bigger.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.480
Are you sure?

27:30.190 --> 27:31.107
Probably.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.819
So you're saying, someone needs
to lure the King of Spades in there?

27:35.403 --> 27:36.321
Yeah.

27:37.113 --> 27:40.116
I'll wait for him inside the store,
and then trigger it.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.285
You're going to die if you do that.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.621
No. I'll make it out.

27:44.704 --> 27:45.747
How?

27:46.790 --> 27:48.541
When the bomb detonates,

27:48.625 --> 27:50.585
if I'm on the second floor,

27:50.669 --> 27:52.587
I'll be able to survive the fall.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.048
Probably.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.594
You know, you say "probably" a lot.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.681
His "probably" is worth betting on.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.265
It's worth its weight in gold.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.559
I'll be the bait.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.687
I'll lure him in.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.065
It's reckless to try to do it alone.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.693
I've handled a lot worse.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.947
We'll… we'll do it together.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.158
Yes, together. Just leave it to us.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.422
All right, then. Let's do it.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.908
<i>We'll lure him to an alley</i>
<i>so he can't get more ammo from the blimp.</i>

29:04.451 --> 29:06.870
Then we'll lure him
to the drugstore from there.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.372
I'm gonna go first.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.167
While I'm doing that,
you'll go to the alley and draw him in.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.294
-Okay.
-Arisu.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.255
Make sure that store is filled with gas.

29:18.047 --> 29:18.965
Yeah.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.117
This thing's a piece of shit!

30:29.244 --> 30:30.161
Oh!

30:46.177 --> 30:47.595
Ann, you almost hit me!

30:49.514 --> 30:50.932
I'm making sure I don't hit you!

33:46.566 --> 33:47.775
Ann!

38:11.038 --> 38:12.415
Come out.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.211
Come here.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.728
Come on.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.897
Come on.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.652
Arisu! Do it!

40:07.154 --> 40:08.322
Aguni!

40:08.906 --> 40:10.157
Are you crazy?

40:13.828 --> 40:14.829
Throw it!

42:05.648 --> 42:06.649
Aguni!

42:07.900 --> 42:09.652
Go.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.034
-Where are they?
-They're all okay.

42:18.994 --> 42:21.330
You've gotta go on to the last game.

42:43.936 --> 42:45.187
Usagi!

42:49.191 --> 42:50.359
Usagi!

42:52.403 --> 42:53.237
Usagi!

42:55.155 --> 42:56.115
Usagi!

45:08.372 --> 45:10.541
I'm-- I'm sorry.

45:22.177 --> 45:24.221
That was the only way…

45:29.935 --> 45:33.564
that I knew how to save you.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.542
Sorry.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.516
I want you to know…

46:12.311 --> 46:14.062
I never held it against you.

46:46.178 --> 46:47.930
What am I supposed to do now?

47:17.751 --> 47:18.752
Mori.

47:32.015 --> 47:33.433
What are you doing here?

47:35.060 --> 47:36.603
Should I beg your forgiveness?

47:39.273 --> 47:40.107
Nah.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.652
I'm the one who should

47:45.279 --> 47:46.697
beg you to forgive me.

47:51.785 --> 47:53.495
I forced my best friend

47:54.746 --> 47:56.874
into a role he didn't want to play.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.599
Take care, my friend.

49:51.405 --> 49:53.073
Aguni.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.128
Shit.

50:07.963 --> 50:10.090
I can't get up.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.845
There's…

50:18.807 --> 50:20.434
…only one left.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.269
Huh…

50:22.352 --> 50:24.604
Huh?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.692
Ann, you're

50:29.818 --> 50:31.028
still alive.

50:36.408 --> 50:37.451
Promise…

50:40.829 --> 50:42.289
…if we meet again…

50:48.295 --> 50:49.713
…we'll be friends.

51:08.774 --> 51:09.775
Ann.

51:12.194 --> 51:13.236
Ann?

51:27.125 --> 51:28.418
Usagi!

51:33.340 --> 51:34.424
Usagi?

51:49.064 --> 51:51.608
<i>This is the final game.</i>

51:51.691 --> 51:55.737
<i>Participating players</i>
<i>should register immediately.</i>

53:13.565 --> 53:14.941
If the rules

53:15.692 --> 53:18.570
force the players
to start killing each other…

53:20.405 --> 53:21.698
I promise that

53:22.616 --> 53:23.950
I'm going to protect you.

53:25.702 --> 53:26.786
That

53:27.662 --> 53:28.955
makes you sound…

53:32.209 --> 53:34.294
…ridiculous right now.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.013
Welcome

55:08.763 --> 55:10.932
to your final game venue!
