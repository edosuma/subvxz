You're not sick.
You've got a full day today.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.009
I'm dying, Maurice.

Oh! Ah! [coughs]

00:53.345 --> 00:57.558
Do you see? If I wasn't dying,
would I make sounds like that? Would I?

00:57.641 --> 01:00.895
You do this every time
there's something you don't want to do.

Oh, Mo-Mo, you sad, sad cynic.

Fine. I'll set up

01:13.866 --> 01:17.077
I have some troubling news, King Julien.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.204
How troubling are we talking?

01:19.287 --> 01:22.875
It's your friend, Rob. He's in a coma.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.585
[gasps] Oh, no!

01:24.668 --> 01:25.961
How did it happen?

01:26.045 --> 01:28.547
It's a medically induced coma.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.382
It was Rob's idea.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.633
Why on Earth would he--

01:31.717 --> 01:35.345
He's been having
a little difficulty sleeping lately

01:35.429 --> 01:38.306
and wanted to catch a few Zs.

Oh, that is so Rob.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.691
Well, if King Julien's okay,
I guess we'll get out of your way.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.985
King Julien is not okay!

have you been feeling restless?

"Yes" to all of those,
especially number eight.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.915
Well, according to this outdated
medical almanac,

02:02.998 --> 02:04.917
you have mad horse disease.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.502
An illness that is extremely rare.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.922
And usually only occurs in horses.

-Ooh, fancy.
-Yeah, except you're not a horse.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.011
Doc, you gotta give it to me straight!

02:16.095 --> 02:18.221
-Is there a cure?
-No.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.434
And I'm afraid, in my expert opinion
as a self-taught doctor

in the way that time.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.744
King Julien, you must make amends
with anyone you have wronged.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.703
Define "wronged."

04:46.787 --> 04:50.040
And also define "amends"
because I'm not a hundred percent sure

04:50.124 --> 04:51.583

10:30.964 --> 10:32.924
a disease every bit as contagious

10:33.007 --> 10:36.303
and deadly as the one
currently ravaging my immune system.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.555
Oh, is there anything I can do

10:38.638 --> 10:41.391
to ease your pain in this difficult time?

10:41.475 --> 10:44.478
Off the top of my head, maybe just, eh...

10:44.561 --> 10:45.812
waiting on me hand-and-foot.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.855
Anything for you, Juju.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.608
That's what I like to hear.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.193
King Julien, she is clearly
up to something.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.529
Surely, you wouldn't deny me the right

10:54.613 --> 10:58.741
to be with my former fiancé
in his last days.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.994
These are not his last days.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.079
King Julien is not actually sick.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
How dare you, Clover!

11:05.248 --> 11:07.750
If you have a problem with your sister
making me soup

11:07.834 --> 11:09.127
and telling me bedtime stories

11:09.210 --> 11:12.922
and changing me when I make boom-boom,
too bad! I am an adult!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.969
-Ugh!
-[groaning]

11:21.806 --> 11:24.476
[humming]

11:25.185 --> 11:27.646
[sighs] I don't feel so great.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.440
This soup is going
to make things all better.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.067
Go on, eat up.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.611
[gulps]

11:35.654 --> 11:37.947
[gasps] Soup? Soup?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.659
How long has this been going on?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.661
Mort! Knock next time!

11:42.743 --> 11:44.954
What if I didn't have any clothes on?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.207
But you don't have any clothes on.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.084
Exactly! That's why we knock!

11:50.168 --> 11:52.170
King Julien, this needs to stop.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.421
You're not sick.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.714
This is just another one
of your weird obsessions.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.091
You don't even have any symptoms.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.093
If you had what Dr. S thinks you have,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.554
there would be a--

12:00.637 --> 12:02.972
Fever. His head feels hot.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.183
He's burning up. And he looks horrid.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.435
See? I'm totally sick, you guys.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.727
In your faces!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.938
[laughs, coughs]

12:11.022 --> 12:14.693
Guys, the patient really needs
some rest right now.

12:14.775 --> 12:19.489
So if you all could just...
you know, move along, that'd be great.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.824
Your Majesty, I'm sorry. I didn't--

12:21.908 --> 12:23.910
He'll have more energy in the morning.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.958
Now, you just need to relax
and let me take care of you,

12:31.376 --> 12:33.127
my little shmoopy bear.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.215
My people, your king is not doing well.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.176
That's bad news, no two ways about it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.011
-Oh, no!
-What does he mean?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.971
I hope he's not ill.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.933
The good news is I'm ready,
willing and able to return

12:47.016 --> 12:49.310
to my old job as your Fear Leader.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.813
But I can promise you this,
it's gonna be great.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.650
What if we decide
we don't want you to be our king?

12:55.734 --> 12:57.818
'Cause we're not afraid of you anymore!

12:58.737 --> 12:59.987
[blows note]

13:00.071 --> 13:02.240
[growling]

13:02.323 --> 13:05.034
-[whimpering]
-Never mind. We're afraid again.

13:05.118 --> 13:05.952
Welcome back.

13:07.704 --> 13:13.126
You all probably remember my close,
personal friend, Mary Ann.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.669
Work friend.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.629
Still counts.

13:15.712 --> 13:20.049
Now Mary Ann has a few words
to share with you about our plan.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.009
I got 'em all warmed up for ya.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.010
Break a leg.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.803
[growls]

13:24.971 --> 13:25.888
Listen up!

13:25.972 --> 13:29.100
Your worst nightmare has come true--

13:29.183 --> 13:31.645
[Horst] Ma... Ma... Mary Ann?

13:31.728 --> 13:34.021
I thought I'd never see you again.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.525
Your worst nightmare has come--

13:37.609 --> 13:40.236
[Horst] Did you get the flowers I sent?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.739
Peonies, your favorite.

13:42.821 --> 13:43.990
[Mary Ann] Silence!

13:44.073 --> 13:45.908
Your worst nightmare has--

13:45.992 --> 13:48.869
[Horst] Oh, look at the two of us
silly so-and-so's,

13:48.953 --> 13:51.122
bantering like we used to.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.792
I wrote you a song. You wanna hear it?

13:54.668 --> 13:55.752
[all gasp]

13:55.834 --> 13:57.253
[screams] Call me!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.046
Now, where was I?

13:59.130 --> 14:02.801
Oh, Right! You all belong to us now!

14:03.384 --> 14:07.430
-[murmuring]
-Oh, come on, man. That ain't right.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.266
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't listen to her.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.644
You don't all belong to the Foosa.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.103
[lemurs sigh in relief]

14:14.187 --> 14:15.396
Only half of you do.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.981
-You gotta be kidding me!
-Half?

14:17.064 --> 14:19.275
-What do you mean half?
-I mean, this is crazy!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.235
What? I cut a deal.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.155
You thought the Foosa
would help me take over the kingdom

14:24.238 --> 14:25.990
out of the goodness of their hearts?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.826
Grow up, you guys!

14:27.908 --> 14:31.162
How do we know our current idiot king
isn't gonna get better?

14:31.245 --> 14:33.998
Trust me. He isn't getting better.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.043
Oh, that is good soup.

14:37.126 --> 14:41.255
Oh, my sweet nephew,
the pineapple of my eye.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.549
How are you feeling?

14:42.632 --> 14:45.009
Uncle, what are you doing here?

14:45.092 --> 14:46.219
I'm here to help.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.262
Fill in for you until you get better,

14:48.346 --> 14:51.098
take over the kingdom for you
if you don't.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.518
Where to take over the what kingdom?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.436
[coughs, chokes]

14:55.520 --> 14:56.896
Rest, darling.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.567
Why not enjoy your last few days in peace.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.942
-King Julien!
-Huh?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.863
Your uncle is working with the Foosa
to steal your kingdom.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.114
Whoo, that's a heck of an accusation

15:07.198 --> 15:08.783
after everything I've done for you.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.869
What have you ever done for me?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.953
It's an expression, Clover.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.377
I knew it! Poison!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.838
She went a little heavy on the cilantro,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.882
but I'd hardly call it poison.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.467
No, King Julien.
You're not sick after all.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.804
You're showing symptoms because
you're being poisoned by my sister!

15:29.888 --> 15:31.055
Crimson? [gasps]

15:31.138 --> 15:33.933
Wow, that's low, even for you.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.976
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.020
It's over, Crimson.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.606
You got that right.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.732
For you.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.567
[whistling]

15:42.650 --> 15:45.111
Ha-ha. That's pretty good whistling.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.696
Check this out.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.032
[blowing raspberry]

15:52.118 --> 15:53.369
[Julien whimpering]

15:54.704 --> 15:56.997
Finish them off however you like.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.583
Well, it's a bit cramped in here,

15:58.666 --> 16:00.084
and I'm late for a crown-fitting.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.127
Toodles.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.212
[growling]

16:04.130 --> 16:05.214
[groaning]

16:06.424 --> 16:07.383
[grunting]

16:07.467 --> 16:09.009
[whimpering]

16:10.303 --> 16:12.430
Save yourself, King Julien, run!

16:27.445 --> 16:29.405
[screaming]

16:30.990 --> 16:34.327
[laughing maniacally]

16:34.702 --> 16:35.662
[screams]

16:35.745 --> 16:37.246
[muffled voice]

16:37.831 --> 16:39.749
-You okay, King Julien?
-[groans]

16:39.874 --> 16:44.044
I'm pretty sure
I ate a little too much poisoned soup.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.756
I'm a little groggy,
but I'll get through it.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.007
How'd you find me?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.176
Might've been the loud,
uninterrupted screaming.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.680
If you were trying to escape,
why were you making so much dang noise?

16:53.763 --> 16:58.476
Uh, because, Maurice, I was scared. Duh.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.686
I know, right?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.897
What do we do?
We're way outnumbered by the Foosa.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.859
-Maybe we can talk to them nicely?
-No.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.236
The time for talking the nicelies is over.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.364
My uncle thinks he's gonna poison me

17:11.447 --> 17:14.993
and steal my kingdom
and take Clover hostage?

17:15.075 --> 17:18.412
That's messed up! That's messed up!

17:18.496 --> 17:20.247
If I have to die of a disease

17:20.331 --> 17:22.542
that's usually only found in horses,

17:22.625 --> 17:25.044
I'm not going down without a fight!

17:25.127 --> 17:27.046
Or a steeple chase or something.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.217
Oh. He's so very brave.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.927
And we still need a plan.

17:33.011 --> 17:37.264
Oh, I've got one of those, Maurice.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.017
[snoring]

17:39.099 --> 17:40.518
Snap out of it!

17:40.601 --> 17:41.728
Let's do this!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.616
Let's get this show on the road, Masikura!

17:55.700 --> 17:56.743
Burning daylight here.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.911
We do not even know

17:57.994 --> 18:00.287
where King Julien is
or whether he will return.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.414
If you think I can't find

18:01.497 --> 18:05.251
another psychic chameleon adviser,
you're wrong!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
Maggie, the Unwashed?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.759
Please, that old hack couldn't predict
her own fart coming on.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.427
Not true.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.636
[farting]

18:26.064 --> 18:27.690
Okay, you may have a point.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.692
Ugh.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.903
No more stalling!

18:36.032 --> 18:36.908
[rumbling]

18:42.162 --> 18:43.289
[clanging]

18:46.375 --> 18:48.294
[roaring]

18:48.377 --> 18:50.254
[groaning]

18:52.757 --> 18:54.341
[all screaming]

18:56.010 --> 18:56.970
There's something wrong!

18:57.971 --> 19:00.681
You guys! It's me, King Julien!

19:01.641 --> 19:03.309
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yay!

19:03.392 --> 19:05.144
Check out my sweet ride!

19:06.771 --> 19:08.064
[gasping]

19:12.359 --> 19:13.235
Sorry!

19:13.319 --> 19:16.405
I probably shouldn't be operating
heavy machinery right now.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.116
Still kinda poisoned.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.159
King Julien?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.160
Hi, Clover.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.662
Do you know how to drive that?

19:22.745 --> 19:23.621
Not really.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.916
Whoa!

19:28.417 --> 19:30.586
Careful, Your Majesty.
You almost killed me!

19:31.170 --> 19:32.212
You're welcome.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.966
Let's chase these jerks out of my kingdom.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.009
On it!

19:38.469 --> 19:42.306
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

19:43.099 --> 19:44.892
Look at 'er go, boys.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.145
The Mega Gecko Aspire!

19:47.227 --> 19:49.438
An all new, completely redesigned,
high-end,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.607
luxury, metal lizard!

19:51.691 --> 19:54.401
I better not end up
in that thing's butt again.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.361
[giggling]

19:55.444 --> 19:57.321
[all screaming]

19:57.404 --> 19:59.448
Oh, that is my spleen!

20:10.584 --> 20:11.794
Whoa!

20:12.336 --> 20:15.089
-Foosa, retreat!
-[Foosas whimpering]

20:16.883 --> 20:17.884
[gasps]

20:18.342 --> 20:20.260
[roars]

20:20.344 --> 20:22.180
Stay away from me! Whoa!

20:25.766 --> 20:26.893
-[farts]
-[Uncle Julien whimpering]

20:31.689 --> 20:32.940
What is it with this kingdom

20:33.024 --> 20:35.693
and all these ding-dang robots?!

20:35.776 --> 20:36.694
Phooey!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.696
Is it too late to tag along
with you fellas?

20:41.991 --> 20:45.078
Hey, what does this button do?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.746
I'ma find out.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.706
[alarm beeping]

20:48.789 --> 20:50.666
Uh-oh. Okay, don't panic,

20:50.750 --> 20:53.586
that blinking warning light
can mean anything.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.047
[electronic voice]
Warning. Self-destruct imminent.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.217
The Mega-Gecko Aspire will go nuclear
and explode in one minute.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.218
[all screaming]

21:00.300 --> 21:01.135
Oh, snap!

21:01.219 --> 21:03.221
I've got to get this thing
away from the kingdom

21:03.303 --> 21:04.931
or my peoples are gonna be blowed up!

21:07.433 --> 21:08.267
No!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.603
[Clover panting]

21:11.187 --> 21:13.856
Terrifying deadly explosion in 30 seconds.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.941
What are you doing?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.442
I'm saving my peoples!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.112
It's okay. All I have to do is jump off.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.948
-Twenty seconds...
-What the--

21:22.031 --> 21:25.201
-Nineteen, eighteen...
-[straining] Timo!

21:25.284 --> 21:26.911
What is this thing around my waist?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.538
It's a safety belt, Your Majesty!

21:29.622 --> 21:32.125
News flash! I don't feel very safe now

21:32.208 --> 21:34.334
'cause I'm strapped
to an exploding dinosaur!

21:34.418 --> 21:37.421
Actually, it's a gecko, Your Majesty!

21:37.504 --> 21:39.048
[Julien] Not the time, nerd!

21:39.132 --> 21:43.010
Oh! I'm not ready to let go of the feet!

21:43.094 --> 21:44.386
We're not gonna lose him!

21:44.470 --> 21:45.721
Not on my watch.

21:47.514 --> 21:51.978
[Julien screaming] I love you guys!
Wait, I have more time. And also--

21:52.728 --> 21:53.562
[all exclaim]

21:58.025 --> 21:59.359
[whimpering]

22:01.695 --> 22:03.614
[panting and gasping]

22:06.159 --> 22:09.578
[sobbing] It's no use. He's gone.

22:09.662 --> 22:14.041
Look! King Julien's crown. [sobs]

22:14.125 --> 22:15.626
What do we do?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.711
We don't rest until we find King Julien.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.172
And in the meantime...

22:19.255 --> 22:21.757
someone needs to hold
the kingdom together.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.801
So man up, wipe your nose,

22:23.884 --> 22:26.679
and try to look like you know
what you're doing.
