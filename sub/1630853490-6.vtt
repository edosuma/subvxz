00:06.507 --> 00:08.090
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.510
I can really have anything?

00:09.593 --> 00:14.890
That's right. It is Daddy Yes Day,
so whatever you ask for, Daddy says yes.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.600
Within reason.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.061
Can I have a rainbow?

00:19.144 --> 00:23.649
Yes. Rainbow order is in.
Time of delivery, TBD.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.068
-What else?
-I want a mermaid.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.278
You're making this too easy.
We will go to the beach.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.822
We will look in the water,
see if we can spot some mermaids.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.907
What else?

00:32.698 --> 00:35.244
-Hamburgers!
-What?

00:35.327 --> 00:37.287
I want hamburgers for lunch.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.249
Oh, Maya, you know that
we don't eat hamburgers.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.335
If you'll settle for a veggie burger,
we'll go to the organic market.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.045
Mom eats hamburgers.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.800
Sweetheart,
your mommy does not eat hamburgers.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.219
She's the one who got me
to stop eating red meat

00:52.302 --> 00:54.429
because it's not good
for your body or your soul.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.433
One time, Mommy ate
three whole hamburgers.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.227
But I only ate one.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.770
But I liked it.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.438
Maya, I need you to be honest with me.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.817
Did this happen in one of
your dreams, maybe?

01:06.900 --> 01:10.362
No, it was real. Like mermaids.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.710
Babe, what are you doing?

01:25.627 --> 01:28.046
It's not good enough.
"Roommates wanted"?

01:28.130 --> 01:31.008
I mean, what was I thinking?
It's roommates need-- It's needed.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.634
Goddamn it.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.761
Babe, it was fine.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.639
It wasn't. It's shit. It's all shit!

01:37.723 --> 01:41.852
Ty, you gotta stop obsessing. You're
poisoning the house, like, literally.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.813
Creative projects make me feel relaxed.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.356
Well, this one's not working.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.691
'Cause I keep screwing 'em up!

01:50.736 --> 01:53.113
We're blackmailing someone, dude.

01:53.197 --> 01:57.159
For like, a significant amount of money.
Like, dark-side money.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.120
Why are you whispering?
Nobody lives here anymore but us.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.789
I don't know.

02:02.873 --> 02:07.336
Okay, you are freaking out.
You gotta focus on the positive.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.464
Once she pays us that money,
honey, we're set.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.634
Yeah? What if she doesn't?
What the hell do we do then?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.802
We've ruined her life!
It's a fucking win-win!

02:16.803 --> 02:20.015
There is a third option, Bun.
What if she turns it against us?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.060
She's smart and sneaky.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.980
We should head down to Mex.
Lay low for a while.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.565
I mean, we can get passports.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.693
Well, that takes too much time.
Fakes, maybe.

02:31.777 --> 02:35.948
Richie makes fakes, but he's already
in Mex, so how do we get to him?

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
All right, that's it.
We're getting out of here.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.619
We both need some air.

02:41.537 --> 02:45.958
$25,000? What is wrong with these people?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.376
What's wrong with you?

02:47.459 --> 02:50.796
It's not the money. The money is--
It's the principle.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.549
What kind of person thinks
they can behave in this way?

02:54.258 --> 02:56.343
Maliciously creating chaos.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.720
That sort of person is you.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.851
I know it's hard to comprehend,
but we don't have any time.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.894
They said two days
or they'll send it to everyone.

03:05.978 --> 03:08.897
How did they get their hands on it?
That's what I'm trying to understand.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.816
Who knows? The point is that they did.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.195
And if we don't pay them,
everyone's gonna see it.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.157
They're gonna see us.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.537
My father took his life.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.377
We don't say that's what happened
because it's a terrible thing to say.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.296
But that's what he did.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.466
There was a private side of his life

03:36.550 --> 03:41.513
that he couldn't, or wouldn't,
live with anymore.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.473
I'm so sorry.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.058
I am too.

03:47.436 --> 03:53.025
And I've been looking
for some kind of… sign.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.361
An off-ramp. A different way.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.989
Maybe this is that sign.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.450
What are you suggesting?

04:01.533 --> 04:04.036
Maybe this is our call to action.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.831
Or rather, inaction.

04:08.540 --> 04:14.046
It's an opportunity to let that which is
not strong enough to stand collapse.

04:14.630 --> 04:18.884
So that we could rebuild.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.597
Together. We're a force, Sheila.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.310
I wanna be with you.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.064
This could be our beginning.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.364
What you're saying, that's impossible.

04:40.447 --> 04:45.452
I mean, what, we're gonna blow up
our whole lives, our careers?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.913
It's not who we are.
I mean, they know that.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.665
They think they know me.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.584
But the only person
that really knows me is you.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.379
And after what you let me see here…

04:55.462 --> 04:56.880
Well, I didn't really let you see--

04:56.964 --> 04:59.007
I think you could say
the same thing about me.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.303
I know it's crazy.

05:04.805 --> 05:10.561
You just think about it… for a day.

05:12.771 --> 05:18.110
Just entertain it… before we let it go.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.195
When I'm with you…

05:24.324 --> 05:26.076
It's the only time I feel free.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.457
We could feel that way all the time.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.629
What's stopping us?

05:46.054 --> 05:49.183
"Persons suffering from
anorexia's ominous variant,

05:49.266 --> 05:54.062
called bulimia, consume high-calorie foods
in rapid, hidden episodes or binges,

05:54.146 --> 05:57.524
often concluding in self-induced vomiting,

05:57.608 --> 06:01.778
either manually
or with the help of emetics or laxatives."

06:01.862 --> 06:04.114
Daddy, when do I get my hamburger?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.783
Sorry, sweetie,
we'll get it in a second, okay?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.578
Why don't you read
your mermaid book there?

06:09.661 --> 06:10.787
I already did.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.165
Well, read it again.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.629
"Such attempts at weight loss
result in weight fluctuation,

06:18.712 --> 06:24.134
mild to severe depression,
amenorrhea, and even kleptomania."

06:40.817 --> 06:42.110
Okay, okay, okay.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.828
And we got these new jerseys,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.373
and they're made out of this,
like, itchy polyester.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.377
And they look so yellow. Like, yellow.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.129
Not like a nice yellow, but like a…

07:01.213 --> 07:03.090
Like a weird, like, mustardy yellow.

07:03.632 --> 07:07.427
You know? And we look like
a gross combination of things out there.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.512
-Yeah.
-It's weird.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.307
I mean,
our school colors are blue and yellow.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.643
Just go with blue. Everybody likes blue.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.937
I like yellow.

07:18.105 --> 07:23.110
Symbolizes the sun, joy,
hope for a brighter future.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.113
A new chapter.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.865
It's an underappreciated hue.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.909
Do you know
what my favorite color is, Zeke?

07:31.535 --> 07:33.453
No, what is it, Dad?

07:33.537 --> 07:34.997
It's yellow.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.582
Right.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.168
My father had a yellow golf shirt
he used to wear all the time.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.421
And my mother got rid of it
without telling him.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.882
She thought it looked effeminate.

07:46.717 --> 07:50.262
Which was a bad thing. In her eyes.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.602
Well, if everyone's done,
boys, would you clear the table?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.770
-Yeah.
-What about my favorite song?

08:00.522 --> 08:01.523
Anyone?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.569
Maybe just one of the top three?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.697
We get it, Dad.
You're a man of mystery.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.577
Mom? Are you okay?

08:15.537 --> 08:16.622
That was a big one.

08:16.705 --> 08:22.336
It's perfectly normal, dear. It's just
the body getting ready for what's to come.

08:25.339 --> 08:32.346
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

08:32.846 --> 08:37.726
Happy birthday, happy birthday

08:37.808 --> 08:41.897
Happy birthday to you

08:41.980 --> 08:43.106
Yay!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.234
Thank you, guys. I'm so happy, thank--

08:46.735 --> 08:47.986
-Yay!
-Yeah!

08:50.614 --> 08:53.700
I didn't know what to wish for
because I have everything.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.744
Except maybe another bottle
of champagne, yeah?

08:55.827 --> 08:57.037
What do you guys think?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.790
-I'm probably good for just one more.
-Yes. Yeah, me too.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.334
Okay, we'll see about that.
We're celebrating.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.963
Did you not like your pasta primavera?
You hardly ate any of it.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.549
Oh, no, I did! It was just very rich.
Really filling.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.218
How? It's just vegetables and pasta.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.638
Is this what drowning feels like?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.391
Yeah, she's probably
saving room for dessert.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.186
They have been written up here for this.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.815
Molten chocolate lava cake.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.650
We preordered it.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.986
Ernie preordered it.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.281
Leona preordered it
when she called up for the reservation.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.283
That still counts, Ern.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.704
Oh, my God. Worth it. As advertised.

09:38.787 --> 09:42.291
Holy shit. Yeah. That is really good.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.251
I gotta say, wow!

09:44.334 --> 09:46.879
Now. Do it now
while they're chocolate drunk.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.590
Well, your Majesty…

09:49.673 --> 09:51.300
Wha-- No.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.385
You guys, I said I didn't need anything.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.138
Well, this is not something you need.
It's something you want.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.769
Oh, my God, Sheila.
Oh, my God, no. This is too much.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.355
-What is it?
-Yeah, now I wanna know. What is it?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.733
I cannot believe you.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.235
For Christ's sake, Greta,
take it out of the bag.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.948
-Look.
-Looks like a nice one.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.784
Yeah, a very nice one.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.746
You remembered. Who remembers?

10:21.622 --> 10:24.625
I guess I remember. You deserve it.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.169
Okay, that's it.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.130
It's bubbles in bubbles time
for these two, Ern. Wrap it up.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.299
What's bubbles in bubbles?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.759
No ifs, ands, or buts.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.637
Well, maybe a couple butts.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.515
-If we're lucky.
-Ern.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.078
Dude, you don't believe in this crap.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.372
Yeah, I know, but--

11:04.081 --> 11:05.457
Hey, don't call it crap.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.585
So, why are we here?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.172
Because-- Because…

11:15.050 --> 11:17.845
Even though
I never believed in this stuff,

11:17.928 --> 11:19.680
being here used to make me feel better.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.726
Just the candles and the whole…

11:26.979 --> 11:28.397
You know.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.481
Sacred vibe?

11:33.277 --> 11:37.322
I guess it's kinda like the beach
but for lamers.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.291
Neither of us liked doing what we did.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.710
But…

11:51.420 --> 11:53.297
it's not the only thing we've done.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.968
We've done good stuff too.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.596
Other stuff.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.932
That's what sits wrong with me, you know?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.729
That we might have put the universe
out of whack with this shit.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.691
Karmically speaking.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.030
Well, maybe this was a bad idea.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.783
We can bail.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.537
No, wait.
Let's just chill for a minute instead.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.589
They got some pretty dank incense in here.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.898
-Bubbles in bubbles!
-Yay!

12:52.981 --> 12:55.234
-Yeah.
-You get it? You get it?

12:55.317 --> 12:57.736
-We do get it.
-Chilled champagne, hot water.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.821
This is the life.

13:00.322 --> 13:04.368
Yeah. It's very energy-intensive,
but yeah.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.078
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.956
-We should get going after this glass.
-Right, yeah.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.250
No. You don't have enough.
Here's a little more.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.753
So, anyway, you know, for me,

13:14.837 --> 13:17.840
it's been a real
through-the-looking-glass experience.

13:17.923 --> 13:21.176
Everything is different,
and not just the sex.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.763
I see my whole life now
with a different perspective.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.014
Just your life?

13:26.098 --> 13:28.600
No, our life. Mine and Greta's.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.685
Right, baby?

13:30.227 --> 13:34.398
And I have come to believe
that good sex is the crux of happiness.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.566
I don't disagree.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.651
-To happiness.
-Yes.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.864
However you personally
define good sex, that is.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.491
And what about you, Mrs. Sheila Rubin?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.535
How do you define it?

13:47.619 --> 13:48.620
Yeah.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.581
What? I'm curious.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.500
No, I just-- You're putting her
on the spot. That's not fair.

13:53.584 --> 13:56.211
I thought that was kind of the point,
right?

13:56.920 --> 13:57.921
Okay…

13:59.715 --> 14:00.716
Well…

14:03.510 --> 14:04.887
Good sex is good sex.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.932
You know it when you see it
and when you feel it, I'd say.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.642
What?

14:11.602 --> 14:13.020
No, I--

14:13.103 --> 14:17.065
I love you so much but that is a cop-out.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.152
-Well, it's a start.
-I think that's a perfect answer.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.695
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.988
All right, how about this?

14:23.488 --> 14:27.951
Who would be your ideal lover,
either real or imagined?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.787
This is such a great question. Okay.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.539
Mine would be Copernicus…

14:32.623 --> 14:34.958
You should tell them everything.
Right now.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.419
Tell them about being fucked in ways
you've always wanted

14:37.503 --> 14:39.171
but never, ever put words to.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.758
Tell them. Do it. Ruin them.
Just make all of this go away.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.218
Okay, Sheila, you go.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.678
Gentlemen first.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.556
Yes, all right. Yeah, I can go.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.310
For me, my ideal lover would be,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.314
my wife, Sheila.

14:57.940 --> 14:58.941
Come on.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.860
-What? I love you.
-Please.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.820
-You're beautiful. Right?
-You--

15:03.904 --> 15:07.658
Your ideal, hypothetical lover is me,
your wife?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.201
That is not a fun answer.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.496
-Okay.
-It's sweet, but it's safe.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.706
Well, what the hell do you want me to say?

15:14.790 --> 15:16.750
I understand it completely.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.045
I mean, look at you.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.674
He's making all the sense in the world.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.053
Thanks, Greta.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.310
Hey, have you guys ever thought
about mixing it up?

15:36.311 --> 15:38.689
Like, stirring the pot?

15:39.398 --> 15:45.320
Maybe with two friends that
you already have a comfort level with?

15:52.703 --> 15:57.291
I think I probably speak confidently
for the two of us

15:57.374 --> 16:02.462
when I say that it is time
for us to get back home.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.047
-Yes. This has been so fun.
-Yeah.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.508
-Let's do it again. Happy Birthday.
-Yeah.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.477
What can I do for you?

16:19.563 --> 16:20.564
Is it happy hour?

16:21.064 --> 16:22.065
Nope.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.860
When will it be happy hour again?

16:24.943 --> 16:26.486
Tomorrow, at 4:00.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.239
You Canadian or something?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.825
Hey. Watch it, now.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.537
No. Sorry. No.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.873
I'm just new.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.046
So it's not happy hour, sadly.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.008
But do you still serve highballs?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.718
Yeah, man. Obviously.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.971
And what does it cost
not during happy hour?

16:53.555 --> 16:54.723
Buck 25.

16:58.227 --> 17:03.148
Okay, deal.
I will take one highball, please.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.069
Yeah, man, but what kind?

17:08.153 --> 17:09.154
Large.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.214
Thank you again. Sorry about that.

17:33.220 --> 17:38.725
So, what did you tell Caitlin
about coming home all wet?

17:40.018 --> 17:42.646
You know what?
She didn't ask, and I didn't offer.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.108
I just doubled her rate
and gave her a tip.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.862
Wow, look at you
just throwing money around.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.405
-Oh, yeah.
-Sugar mama!

17:53.282 --> 17:55.951
And Greta's handbag too.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.703
That thing. How much was that?

17:57.786 --> 18:01.707
Let me think. It was, my money…

18:02.499 --> 18:04.459
-Okay. Okay.
-…plus 50 cents.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.669
Okay.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.588
-Are you jealous?
-Yeah, maybe.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.506
Want a handbag?

18:10.132 --> 18:11.383
-No.
-No?

18:11.466 --> 18:14.803
But I would not mind a brand-new belt.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.139
Most of mine are pretty beat up.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.599
Let me see.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.023
You know what I think?

18:28.275 --> 18:33.238
I think that you encouraged them
to come onto us tonight.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.824
-What? Please.
-Because I didn't do it.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.785
-Yes. Yes, you do.
-Please. You're right, yeah.

18:38.869 --> 18:42.080
Mister fucking cock-of-the-walk
at preschool.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.958
-Okay. Sure.
-I know what happens there.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.084
I know!

18:47.961 --> 18:50.714
That the first thing
you've actually eaten tonight?

18:52.758 --> 18:54.426
Sorry, never mind. I--

18:59.848 --> 19:01.433
Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.353
What's going on?

19:04.436 --> 19:07.606
I don't know why
I'm getting into this right now.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.651
Getting into what?

19:12.819 --> 19:19.326
Look, I really don't want to,
but I think at some point I have to.

19:21.036 --> 19:26.291
I'm suddenly very aware of something
that I wish I was aware of much sooner.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.505
Although,
come to think of it, I probably was.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.258
Steady. You don't know what he's onto yet.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.386
And, damn it, I am so sorry, Sheila.

19:37.469 --> 19:41.265
I'm really, really sorry
that I didn't take the time

19:41.348 --> 19:44.935
to just see it right in front of me.

19:45.018 --> 19:49.189
Don't help him.
Stay still. Show him nothing.

19:49.273 --> 19:50.607
But you have an issue.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.988
A medical issue with food.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.366
Is that all he's got? You can handle this.

20:00.617 --> 20:04.162
And if my reading is any indication,

20:04.246 --> 20:07.040
It has little to do with food
and more to do with control.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.169
You read a book.
Congratu-fucking-lations.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.629
I want you to know,
this isn't me accusing you of anything.

20:12.713 --> 20:18.886
This is me, right now, coming to you,
offering help and understanding.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.054
Do not say a goddamn thing.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.061
Is it bingeing and throwing up?

20:29.813 --> 20:31.064
Is that what it is?

20:32.733 --> 20:33.859
It doesn't totally matter.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.987
-I'm not accusing you of doing that--
-It feels like you are.

20:37.487 --> 20:41.992
I don't wanna fight, okay?
I just wanna help you, if you'll let me.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.369
Maybe help you find a group?

20:44.453 --> 20:46.246
-I read that groups can--
-A group?

20:47.581 --> 20:50.584
A group? I'm talking to a group?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.211
A group, yes.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.838
Well, let me finish.
I've been reading about them, okay?

20:54.922 --> 20:57.341
-Look, if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, okay?
-You're wrong.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.343
You're off the fucking charts wrong!

20:59.426 --> 21:03.180
Great, then let me be wrong!
Let me just finish being wrong, okay?

21:03.263 --> 21:06.475
Before you fucking run away
like you do every time, all right?

21:06.558 --> 21:09.144
Sheila, I love you.

21:09.228 --> 21:11.897
I care about you. I'm worried about you.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.315
Shut him out now!

21:13.398 --> 21:14.525
Okay, anything else?

21:15.108 --> 21:19.613
What? No. There's nothing else, just that.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.034
You can close the door now if you want.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.601
What do you think
about us getting a bidet?

21:51.228 --> 21:53.063
I've only seen one one time

21:53.146 --> 21:55.274
when I was a kid
with my parents in Montreal.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.775
But sure, if you'd like.

22:01.613 --> 22:02.614
You okay?

22:03.282 --> 22:05.492
What? Yeah, of course. Are you?

22:05.576 --> 22:06.577
Yeah, I--

22:07.870 --> 22:10.122
I know you had expectations.

22:14.001 --> 22:17.296
I'm happy. I am.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.383
Because I never
would've brought that up a year ago.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.179
I like that. I'm maturing.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.056
Only in the good ways.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.686
Happy birthday.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.649
I'm gonna dream about that cake.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.324
I'm gonna dream about ancient Rome.

22:54.958 --> 22:59.254
When I imagine you begging me
for something, it isn't for this.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.340
Well, this is where we're at.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.385
You considered though? Did you--

23:05.469 --> 23:08.931
I can't. It's--
Not yet anyway.

23:09.014 --> 23:12.100
-But did you at least consider--
-I did! I told you I did.

23:12.184 --> 23:16.563
And it's just-- It's not a possibility.
What this is-- This is just the cost of…

23:17.397 --> 23:19.358
-The cost of…
-Of all of this!

23:24.446 --> 23:28.534
$25,000. That's real money.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.787
Yeah. And you have it, don't you?

23:32.371 --> 23:34.206
Yes, but that's not the point.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.124
What, is it in a safe somewhere?

23:36.750 --> 23:39.753
Some slush fund you use
to grease the wheels of the city?

23:40.462 --> 23:42.047
-You make me sound like a--
-What?

23:42.923 --> 23:46.260
Don't pretend you're like a Boy Scout now
when we both know that's not the case.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.846
There are norms
to doing business in San Diego.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.597
There is a way that things work.

23:50.681 --> 23:53.392
So you're the only one who's allowed
to bend the rules to build something?

23:54.268 --> 23:57.062
I'm building something too.
And I'm not begging you, I'm telling you.

23:57.145 --> 23:59.022
Get up. This is happening.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.495
Keep going. No one's doing this for you.

24:13.579 --> 24:17.499
This is your time, your chance,
to see things through.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.390
Where's the tape?

24:38.604 --> 24:41.773
-If it's not all there, there's--
-Why do-- It's all there.

24:45.861 --> 24:47.946
How do I know this is the only copy?

24:48.030 --> 24:49.656
You're just gonna have to trust us.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.081
Good luck.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.669
-You too.
-Oh, baby…

25:04.671 --> 25:07.174
Never mind. Rescinded.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.347
Hello?

25:13.430 --> 25:14.890
You're so close now,

25:14.973 --> 25:17.226
unless you give up
and let it all go to waste.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.727
Maria, I'm home.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.024
Honey?

25:24.107 --> 25:26.109
All your hard work. All that pain.

25:30.864 --> 25:31.990
Hello?

25:37.871 --> 25:40.415
It can't be for nothing.
You've gotta stick with it.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.543
See it through. Are you with me?

25:59.685 --> 26:00.686
Where is she?

26:00.769 --> 26:01.937
Right over here.

26:07.860 --> 26:10.529
I know it's tough, but you've come so far.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.200
Just a little longer now.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.370
One last push.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.835
I believe in you. That's it.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.378
You've got this.
