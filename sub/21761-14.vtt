[Julien] As you know,
it's that time of the month again.

00:44.712 --> 00:48.841
That time when we sacrifice
one of our earthly possessions

00:48.924 --> 00:52.511
to the higher power,
known as Frank the Sky God.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.971
[all cheering]

00:54.054 --> 00:55.973
A guy I'd really like to meet.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.893
Just to confirm that he's real because

00:58.976 --> 01:01.395
I've never actually seen him.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.859
Step right up
and put your offering on the pile.

01:07.026 --> 01:10.612
[all] Frank! Frank! Frank!

01:11.112 --> 01:15.743
Ooh, Frank, a bunny. It's adorable!

01:15.826 --> 01:19.079
Why don't you come on down and get it?
Huh?

01:19.162 --> 01:20.121
What do you say?

01:22.123 --> 01:23.166
Oh-ho!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.794
Look! A rusty can!

01:26.003 --> 01:27.212
Pretty weak, Willie.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.883
Who doesn't want their very own rusty can?

01:30.966 --> 01:31.884
[laughs sarcastically]

01:32.009 --> 01:35.721
I dare you, not to come down here
right now and get it.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.391
Right now, Frank! Please?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.018
[sighing]

01:41.184 --> 01:44.438
Uh, King Julien,
are you upset about something?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.857
Yes, Maurice. I'm surprised you noticed.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.650
I mask my feelings so well.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.152
I've started to doubt Frank's existence.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.949
I no longer feel his presence
deep down in my nether-parts.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.075
[gasps]

01:56.199 --> 01:57.701
He doesn't mean it, Frank.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.662
King Julien,
tell Frank you don't mean that.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.331
I do mean it, Masikura. Think about it.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.376
We come out to the beach
every month to thank Frank

02:06.460 --> 02:08.670
by giving him some pretty cool stuff,

02:08.754 --> 02:11.006
but he never actually takes any of it.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.591
Also, there's the Foosa.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.302
If Frank the Sky God was really up there,

02:15.385 --> 02:18.806
don't you think he'd prevent them
from eating us all the time?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.434
And need I mention
the most obvious bit of evidence?

02:22.517 --> 02:26.521
How could Frank exist in a world
where this could happen?

02:26.605 --> 02:27.815
[giggles]

02:28.148 --> 02:30.734
Frank works in mysterious ways.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.528
Or, there is no Frank.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.448
[gasping]

02:36.991 --> 02:38.742
She's with Frank now.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.243
I'll never be fine

02:40.327 --> 02:43.497
until I know for a fact
that Frank is real!

02:43.580 --> 02:46.959
[all] Frank! Frank! Frank!

02:48.460 --> 02:51.713
Are you there, Frank? It's me, Julien.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.924
I'm not sure if you're on vacation

02:54.008 --> 02:56.551
or you're just trapped
under something heavy

02:56.635 --> 03:00.179
and unable to answer me,
but Frank, if you're out there,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.683
give me some kind of a sign, man.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.393
Oh, well,

03:05.519 --> 03:07.228
I guess there's no Frank.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.439
[yawns]

03:10.649 --> 03:12.400

-[chimes ringing]
-[muttering]

03:18.406 --> 03:19.950
Mort, go back to your hut!

03:20.034 --> 03:21.743
I don't want any of your sleep-hugs.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.375
I am Frank.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.626
Uh, sorry, Frank who?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.587
Frank the Sky God, Frank.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.008
Mm, yeah, I don't think so.
Frank's not real and if he was real,

03:36.175 --> 03:40.054
he'd be way taller,
and you know, more glowy.

03:41.221 --> 03:45.517
If I weren't Frank, could I do this?

03:45.684 --> 03:47.102
Big whoop!

03:47.186 --> 03:50.022
I know, like,
four other guys who can do that too.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.190
Doesn't prove anything.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.526
Um, but if you're really Frank,

03:54.609 --> 03:57.571
can you make sparkly glitter hearts appear

03:57.654 --> 03:59.698
out of thin air that spell my name?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.659
[chiming]

04:03.702 --> 04:04.912
Still not convinced.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.206
Can you pull an egg
out of your mouth hole?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.457
Huh?

04:10.959 --> 04:11.835
Meh...

04:11.919 --> 04:16.757
Can you make a perfect
coconut crème brûlée?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.886
Actually, I've had better.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.513
Whatever, Julien. I'm Frank,

04:23.597 --> 04:27.184
and I'm not going to stand here
proving it to you.

04:27.350 --> 04:31.063
That's exactly
what the real Frank would say!

04:31.230 --> 04:33.565
Frank! It's really you!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.025
[laughing]

04:35.150 --> 04:38.403
Hey, listen, sorry about the whole
not believing in you thing.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.073
Also, I may or may not have
taken your bunny.

04:41.489 --> 04:45.619
-[horn blowing]
-[murmuring tiredly]

04:45.786 --> 04:49.164
Due to the fact
that Maurice is a big ol' doubter...

04:49.497 --> 04:50.373
I'm a what?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.710
...and has called into question
the existence of Frank.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.087
[all gasping]

04:55.254 --> 04:59.424
I, your king,
decided to call in a few favors.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.218
Behold!

05:02.677 --> 05:05.180
[all chattering]

05:05.430 --> 05:06.807
It can't be!

05:10.060 --> 05:13.396
Yes, it is I, Frank the Sky God.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.275
I stand before you in all my glory.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.486
Frank! Frank! Frank!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.572
Hello, Masikura.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.407
My...

05:24.491 --> 05:26.785
He said hello. He said...

05:26.868 --> 05:30.455
[stuttering] he-he-he-he-llo-oh-oh--

05:30.580 --> 05:32.040
[gasping]

05:33.374 --> 05:36.295
Uh, King Julien,
are you sure that's Frank?

05:36.962 --> 05:41.466
Oh, Maurice, if I were not Frank,

05:41.549 --> 05:44.343
then how would I know your secrets?

05:44.761 --> 05:48.347
Especially what you did...
with your butt.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.808
Hmm? Uh, I, I--

05:49.933 --> 05:51.685
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.188
The throne room.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.608
Maybe next time, King Julien,
you'll listen to what I have to say.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.820
Forgive me, Frank. Forgive me!

06:01.987 --> 06:04.781
How could you? I sat on that throne!

06:04.865 --> 06:06.200
With my booty.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.244
Admittedly,
what Maurice did was really weird,

06:09.328 --> 06:10.996
but it doesn't mean you're Frank.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.498
Ah, yes, Clover.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.626
Someone told me you would be skeptical.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.546
Someone who took you to wrestling practice

06:19.629 --> 06:22.632
every morning,
even though your mother forbade it.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.467
Grandma Rose? That's impossible.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.054
She died in a back alley brawl
with a wildebeest.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.472
I spoke with her yesterday.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.560
She wanted me to relay
a very important message

06:33.643 --> 06:35.520
to her little bruiser.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.816
[gasping] No one knows she called me that.
What's the message?

06:39.900 --> 06:44.112
Where she buried her favorite pair
of brass knuckles? Tell me, tell me!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.656
She said, "In a fight,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.743
always go for the eyes and the nose."

06:50.493 --> 06:53.454
I always do, Grandma Rose. [whimpering]

06:54.622 --> 06:57.376
-Always do.
-Any other doubting Debbies out there?

07:01.462 --> 07:05.967
Great, now that that's settled, listen up.
This is a big moment for me.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.764
I've gotta be honest,
I was lost thinking Frank wasn't real,

07:10.847 --> 07:15.727
but I know now that Frank is real
and watching over all of us!

07:15.936 --> 07:18.313
[all cheering]

07:19.147 --> 07:22.859
King Julien, I will now bestow upon
your people an important message.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.944
Of course, buddy.

07:24.278 --> 07:28.448
Many of you may be wondering
why I am here.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.618
Am I being promoted to Sky God?
A follow-up question:

07:31.701 --> 07:34.246
Does my new position
come with a superpower?

07:34.329 --> 07:37.624
Because, I can't decide
if I want to make things explode

07:37.707 --> 07:41.044
with my brainy parts,
or have tentacles for hands.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.713
And everyone would be like,
"Oh, King Julien,

07:43.797 --> 07:46.674
your super awesome tentacle hands
are so super awesome

07:46.758 --> 07:48.635
that they're freaking me out, man!"

07:48.718 --> 07:49.677
Sorry. Proceed.

07:49.761 --> 07:55.392
I am here because my brother,
Larry the Volcano God,

07:55.558 --> 07:58.353
is angry with all of you.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.606
He has vowed to destroy Madagascar

08:01.773 --> 08:03.817
unless you sacrifice...

08:03.984 --> 08:07.779
King Julien by throwing him
into the volcano by sundown today.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.240
Yeah! Let's... Wait, what you say what?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.616
Let's get him!

08:11.783 --> 08:14.119
[all shouting]

08:14.286 --> 08:15.745
[screams]

08:15.912 --> 08:17.456
[Maurice] King Julien, what are you doing?

08:17.622 --> 08:19.249
I'm hiding from my people.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.584
-They're hunting me.
-No one's hunting you.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.628
King Julien, are you in there?

08:23.711 --> 08:28.425
I just need your measurements.
I'm not here to sacrifice you.

08:28.549 --> 08:29.676
[giggling sarcastically]

08:30.010 --> 08:30.885
[imitating Mort] No.

08:31.136 --> 08:36.099
Just me, Mort,
being small and annoying as usual.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.684
[Julien giggling]

08:37.934 --> 08:41.604
No, tell Masikura
that King Julien's not in there.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.482
We'll have to keep looking.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.858
[whimpering]

08:44.941 --> 08:48.611
Your Majesty, I'm sure
this is all just a big misunderstanding.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.572
Instead of freaking out,
let's go talk to Frank.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.241
Calmly and rationally.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.617
Yeah. Yeah.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.329
Calmly and rationally.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.122
I can do that.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.665
[sighs deeply]

09:02.542 --> 09:05.212
Remember, calmly and rationally.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.463
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.590
[whistling]

09:09.674 --> 09:11.926
Oh, hey, Frank, uh...

09:12.635 --> 09:17.098
So listen, about the whole,
"throwing me into a volcano" thing--

09:17.265 --> 09:18.975
[bawling]

09:19.059 --> 09:20.435
Please, Frank.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.771
Don't make Julien jump
into the volcano, please.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.773
Silence!

09:26.483 --> 09:28.527
Kneel before me.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.697
Julien.

09:32.864 --> 09:33.948
[gasping]

09:34.032 --> 09:35.075
Oh, Karl?

09:35.242 --> 09:39.162
I hope you're enjoying
my brilliant charade as a Sky God.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.206
Chauncey helped pick out the eyelids.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.790
Didn't you, Chauncey?

09:43.458 --> 09:47.295
Impersonating a Sky God?
This is a new low, man!

09:47.462 --> 09:50.965
Indeed. I bet you're wondering
how I came up with such an ingenious,

09:51.049 --> 09:53.176
uber-complicated plan such as this.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.177
No, not really.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.887
Good, because I'm going to tell you.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.847
It all started when I got hit

09:57.931 --> 10:01.809
by your hot air balloon
full of wish rocks.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.480
As I recovered from my concussion,

10:05.646 --> 10:10.193
I began reading
all of your pathetic wishes.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.029
Oh, oh.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.031
That's disgusting.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.495
I realized, that I could use you

10:20.579 --> 10:23.957
and your kingdom's belief
in Frank to my advantage.

10:24.040 --> 10:29.337
I could become Frank,
the all-knowing Sky God!

10:29.670 --> 10:34.175
Of course, I anticipated that some of you
would need a little convincing,

10:34.675 --> 10:38.638
so I sent Chauncey to get the goods.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.189
How serendipitous
that your little crisis of faith

10:48.273 --> 10:50.358
would coincide with my plans.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.446
The icing on my evil genius cake.

10:54.821 --> 10:59.242
That cake is iced
with failure frosting, Karl.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.286
And I'm saving you a corner piece

11:01.369 --> 11:04.498
because there's no way
you're going to get away with this.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.291
I'll tell my peoples everything!

11:06.625 --> 11:08.251
[laughing sarcastically]

11:08.418 --> 11:09.586
Be my guest.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.631
Too bad no one will believe you.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.048
[laughs]

11:14.132 --> 11:16.759
Please, I am their king.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.305
They have to believe everything I say.
It's the law.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.973
Uh, no, it isn't.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.933
It, uh, it isn't?

11:24.017 --> 11:24.934
Ugh.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.561
Who is in charge around here?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.647
Why would they listen to you

11:28.729 --> 11:32.108
when the almighty gods have spoken?

11:32.275 --> 11:34.861
No. You will be sacrificed
by your own people.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.280
[laughs hysterically]

11:37.405 --> 11:40.408
It's brilliant! I am brilliant!

11:41.409 --> 11:43.119
Not so fast, Karl.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.872
I'm not giving up my king without a fight.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.209
[exclaiming]

11:50.418 --> 11:51.919
[grunts in pain]

11:52.128 --> 11:53.171
Clover!

11:53.672 --> 11:55.632
I said, "Put 'em up."

11:58.051 --> 12:00.803
What's wrong, Julien? You look afraid.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.473
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.267
Not yet, at least.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.562
Run, Your Majesty! Run!

12:08.645 --> 12:11.606
[screaming] Why?!

12:11.772 --> 12:16.152
[babbling incoherently]

12:18.196 --> 12:20.031
-Snap out of it!
-Huh?

12:20.114 --> 12:21.408
[indistinct chatter]

12:21.782 --> 12:24.118
What are you all waiting for? Get him!

12:24.452 --> 12:26.705
-Wait! Hear me out.
-Make it quick.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.831
Okay, I've got bad news.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.669
Karl built a robot
and is pretending to be Frank

12:32.751 --> 12:35.880
because he wants you
to throw me in the volcano.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.885
Good news is, we're all going to
band together and stop him.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.345
Okay, who's got a plan?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.431
I'll get his legs, someone get his feet.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.016
We can toss him
in the volcano before dinner.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.893
Oh, Frank will be so proud of me!

12:49.018 --> 12:49.977
No, no!

12:50.061 --> 12:53.022
Are you not listening? Karl is Frank.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.442
Uh-huh, we'll need tape for his mouth!

12:55.609 --> 12:59.028
But the screaming is the best part
of the ritual sacrifice.

12:59.237 --> 13:02.115
[screaming]

13:02.198 --> 13:04.659
[panting, gasping]

13:05.201 --> 13:07.912
Oh, man. This is it.

13:08.037 --> 13:13.000
There's no way I can beat a god,
even if he is fake.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.836
[Mort] You're a god to me, King Julien.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.005
Ah, not now, Mort.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.508
-Ow, ow, ow!
-Wait, that's it!

13:20.967 --> 13:21.800
Timo!

13:22.969 --> 13:26.389
I need you to make me a god.
And I need you to do it in like an hour.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.432
Hmm!

13:27.641 --> 13:31.227
[triumphant instrumental music playing]

13:34.897 --> 13:37.358
Julien, meet Larry the Volcano God.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.030
[Julien] Yes.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.949
If I was a god,

13:45.032 --> 13:48.119
I believe this is exactly
what I'd look like.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.121
Uh, how are its dance moves?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.081
Is that important?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.626
[grunting]

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
Dance is life, Timo.
It's always important.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.132
So, uh, where's the door on this thing?

14:01.633 --> 14:04.135
[laughing, snorting]

14:04.218 --> 14:05.512
I forgot to build a door.

14:06.053 --> 14:10.350
Timo, how am I going to fight Karl's robot
if I can't even get into mine?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.353
Well, you could go in through the ear.

14:13.603 --> 14:17.565
The ear? Who besides Mort, would be
even tiny enough to fit through there?

14:17.940 --> 14:18.857
[Mort] Mmm.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.736
-Oil--
-No, Mort! Focus.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.699
-[Mort groaning] Oh... Hey... Ooh...
-[grunting]

14:25.906 --> 14:27.701
Suck it in, Mort.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.036
I'm trying!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.455
Step aside, Timo. I'll handle this.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.627
I'm okay!

14:37.794 --> 14:41.172
Remember, the suit is hooked up
to your temporal lobe, so,

14:41.339 --> 14:43.966
whatever you want the suit to do,
it will do.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.722
Feet!

14:51.015 --> 14:54.894
Mort! Put me down right now--

14:55.144 --> 14:56.145
Sorry.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.146
[giggling]

14:57.438 --> 14:58.606
Fire up the thrusters.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.070
Test number two.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.284
Robot! Robot! Robot!

15:10.869 --> 15:12.662
[grunting]

15:12.829 --> 15:15.081
I am a robot! I am a robot!

15:18.710 --> 15:22.171
Mort, stop goofing around!
We've got an evil genius to stop.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.297
Okay.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.383
[screaming]

15:25.466 --> 15:27.594
-[crashing]
-[Mort grunting]

15:29.262 --> 15:30.513
Ai-jai-jai.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.473
Okay, Mort, let's go.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.519
Since King Julien is too afraid to show up

15:36.603 --> 15:39.522
to do his duty as your king,

15:39.689 --> 15:43.067
I am forced to sacrifice these two

15:43.150 --> 15:46.905
to my brother Larry instead.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.032
[grunting]

15:50.366 --> 15:52.034
It's go-time, Mort.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.704
Just read from the cue cards and remember,

15:54.788 --> 15:58.124
when I scream, "Throw me into a volcano,"

15:58.207 --> 15:59.500
that's your cue.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.419
[Mort]  Got it!  [giggling]

16:01.961 --> 16:03.504
Prepare to be--

16:03.671 --> 16:09.302
No, take me, Frank!
Let me be your sacrifice, please!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.681
I love you!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.767
Where was I? Right.

16:15.934 --> 16:20.438
Prepare to witness
the awesome power of me,

16:20.521 --> 16:23.232
Frank the Sky God, as I--

16:23.316 --> 16:26.986
Not so fast, Frank! Karl...
Whoever you are.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.614
King Julien, there you are.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.115
I knew you would come back.

16:31.198 --> 16:34.702
A great king like you
would never forsake his people.

16:34.953 --> 16:35.912
Yes!

16:35.995 --> 16:40.541
I am a great king,
and I have come to sacrifice myself.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.376
Ah, huh?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.879
Oh, this is it, Chauncey!

16:44.963 --> 16:47.381
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.676
Victory is nigh, my friend!

16:49.759 --> 16:52.136
[squeaking]

16:52.553 --> 16:56.474
Don't worry, Julien.
This won't hurt a bit. Not--

16:56.641 --> 17:00.311
Not yet, at least. Yeah, yeah, I know!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.856
[laughing hysterically]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.899
How I love the way we banter.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.361
I think I'll miss that the most,
when you're gone.

17:08.444 --> 17:13.032
Aw, that'd be sweet, if you weren't
about to throw me into a volcano!

17:14.951 --> 17:17.620
I said, "If you weren't about to

17:17.787 --> 17:21.040
throw me into a volcano!"

17:21.248 --> 17:23.626
Yes, I heard you the first time.

17:23.918 --> 17:25.753
Come on, Mort, come on!

17:25.920 --> 17:27.922
One more time for the lemurs in the back.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.217
If you weren't about

17:31.384 --> 17:35.638
to throw me into the volcano!

17:35.972 --> 17:39.809
"Throw me into a volcano."
[repeating rapidly]

17:39.976 --> 17:41.477
Oh, that's my cue!

17:43.103 --> 17:44.355
[grunts]

17:47.233 --> 17:48.735
Well played, Julien.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.653
Care to introduce your friend?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.656
Who? Him?
Never seen him before in my life.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.366
What is wrong, Frank?

17:55.449 --> 17:58.244
Do you not recognize your own brother?

17:58.327 --> 18:01.330
[gasps] Frank and Larry?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.331
[sighs]

18:02.540 --> 18:06.502
Why, hello, Larry. Thank you for coming.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.589
I'm just about to be thrown
into a volcano.

18:09.672 --> 18:13.593
Is there anything you'd like to say
before I do that?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.678
Anything at all?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.556
Uh, yes. I wanted to say...

18:18.723 --> 18:20.266
Uh...

18:20.391 --> 18:21.225
I...

18:23.853 --> 18:25.354
Something about Frank being a liar

18:25.438 --> 18:27.941
and how I shouldn't be thrown
into the volcano?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.734
Perhaps. I mean, just as an idea.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.027
Yes!

18:31.318 --> 18:32.737
Frank is lying!

18:32.820 --> 18:35.740
King Julien should not be thrown
into the volcano.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.285
Frank should be thrown into the volcano!

18:39.702 --> 18:40.912
[gasping]

18:41.203 --> 18:45.207
All right, Larry.
Let's see what you're made of.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.043
But I should warn you,

18:47.209 --> 18:52.172
you mess with the Frank, you get these!

18:54.425 --> 18:56.343
You mean, these?

18:57.470 --> 19:01.641
Huh? You've got those, too.
Well, what about...

19:08.606 --> 19:11.651
[sing-song] Buttons. Buttons.
I love pushing buttons.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.490
-[gasping]
-[grunting]

19:25.331 --> 19:27.625

-[screaming]

19:27.792 --> 19:29.127
[all gasping]

19:30.044 --> 19:31.129
Maurice, swing!

19:31.295 --> 19:33.380
-[grunting]
-[whimpering]

19:34.340 --> 19:38.594
This is no time for fun and games, guys!

19:39.762 --> 19:40.805
Ah!

19:50.230 --> 19:52.025
Enough peacocking!

19:52.525 --> 19:53.985
Let's do this!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.611
[giggling] Okay.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.994
[exclaiming]

20:05.579 --> 20:07.665
[groaning]

20:08.916 --> 20:11.335
You are no match for me, Larry!

20:11.418 --> 20:13.212
No one can stop me!

20:13.295 --> 20:15.798
[screaming]

20:15.882 --> 20:16.883
[Mort]  No!

20:17.175 --> 20:20.094
No! No!

20:20.594 --> 20:23.597
Now, where is Julien?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.226
Ah, the lava is burning
the royal feet pads.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.477
Help!

20:28.561 --> 20:32.106
Not the feet!

20:32.940 --> 20:35.109
You're going to have to go through me

20:35.193 --> 20:38.821
if you want to save
your precious King Julien.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.865
Okay by me!

20:41.866 --> 20:42.700
No!

20:42.992 --> 20:44.744
-Ah, oh.
-[grunting]

20:53.086 --> 20:57.297
This is for King Julien!

20:57.464 --> 20:58.424
Frank!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.553
Why!

21:02.636 --> 21:04.304
[sobbing]

21:05.472 --> 21:06.891
Congratulations, Julien.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.435
It appears you have won this round.

21:09.602 --> 21:13.189
News flash, Karl, I win every round.

21:13.773 --> 21:19.112
This isn't over, Julien!
Not yet, at least!

21:19.695 --> 21:21.906
Yeah, yeah, I can lower my voice, too.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.992
[in a lowered voice]
See, I'm doing it right now.

21:26.869 --> 21:27.703
Gotcha!

21:27.995 --> 21:29.329
[giggling]

21:29.663 --> 21:31.331
[cheering]

21:33.084 --> 21:36.420
-King Julien, you're safe!
-So, who's the big guy?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.505
Ha-ha-ha, hello.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.091
-Mort?
-Mort?

21:40.174 --> 21:44.929
Mighty Larry,
take me to your lava palace, please!

21:45.221 --> 21:46.139
[digital beeping]

21:46.430 --> 21:47.681
[grunts]

21:49.100 --> 21:50.350
[sighing]

21:50.643 --> 21:51.978
What's wrong, King Julien?

21:52.061 --> 21:54.688
Karl's gone,
and no one got thrown into the volcano.

21:54.772 --> 21:55.940
You should be happy.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.610
I can't be happy
knowing that Frank's not real.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.905
Wait. Wait, I'm feeling something

22:02.989 --> 22:05.491
deep down in my nether-parts.

22:06.492 --> 22:10.163
-The royal butt is on fire!
-Stop drop and roll, Your Majesty!

22:14.000 --> 22:15.209
[sighs] Whew!

22:15.293 --> 22:18.337
That sky rain just put out my butt-fire.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.800
Could that mean...

22:22.883 --> 22:25.803
No!
It still doesn't prove that Frank is real.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.888
I mean, after all, if he were real,

22:27.972 --> 22:31.851
he would definitely have done something
about how annoying Mort is by now.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.351
[laughing]

22:33.936 --> 22:35.353
[Mort shouting in pain]

22:37.439 --> 22:40.276
He really does work in mysterious ways.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.403
[dramatic music playing]
