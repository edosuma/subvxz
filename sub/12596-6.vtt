02:55.885 --> 02:57.595
This is a nice house.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.097
Thank you.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.687
You're probably wondering
why I haven't called, huh?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.148
Yeah.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.321
You live so nice.

03:15.822 --> 03:20.201
Your family is so normal,
it might be hard for you to understand.

03:20.618 --> 03:24.163
We're not judging you, Eve,
or the situation.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.669
Sure you are.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.255
What kind of mom
just lets her kid run away?

03:32.338 --> 03:35.967
Doesn't answer calls about him,
doesn't show up looking for him.

03:36.050 --> 03:39.595
Can't even imagine what Nolan
has been saying about me.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.100
What has he been saying?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.104
Not much, actually.

03:48.563 --> 03:49.814
Yeah?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.315
Yeah.

03:53.693 --> 03:57.530
Well, I'm a shitty mom.
You know, I'm not proud of it.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.574
I'm doing the best I can.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.619
Circumstances were just
stacked against us.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.584
How come we never knew about
you and Nolan?

04:09.667 --> 04:13.379
Sweetie, are you ready?
You're gonna be late for school.

04:13.463 --> 04:16.549
- Nobody ever wants to talk about this.
- Janey, don't.

04:16.799 --> 04:18.259
Don't.

04:31.481 --> 04:37.111
You had conversations with Meg
and my mother, yes?

04:39.071 --> 04:42.825
Your father made promises
that affect my son and his future.

04:45.036 --> 04:48.122
Why is it no one in your family
seems to care?

04:51.626 --> 04:56.339
- I'm gonna be late for work, can we go?
- Sure. Yeah, we can go, baby.

04:56.422 --> 04:58.549
Ahem. We can go.

05:04.889 --> 05:07.517
It really is a nice house.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.466
-Hi, Mrs. Aguirre?
-It's "Ortiz" now.

05:40.675 --> 05:43.427
Hi, I'm Meg Rayburn.
Maybe you know my brother John.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.971
He works with your husband.

05:47.098 --> 05:49.934
Ex-husband. What do you want?

05:55.898 --> 06:00.653
I have a copy of a 911 call report
from when you were married.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.739
It indicates that there was
a domestic dispute at your house.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.577
And that it became violent.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.204
Where did you get that?

06:10.955 --> 06:12.748
If an officer would've responded,

06:12.832 --> 06:15.376
there should have been
some kind of paperwork.

06:15.710 --> 06:19.547
But, for some strange reason,
there's no incident report filed.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.134
What do you want from me?

06:25.011 --> 06:27.555
I just wanna know
what happened that night.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.559
Did he hurt you?

06:32.351 --> 06:35.646
I'm sorry... I can't talk about this.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.857
Did you go to the hospital?

07:04.675 --> 07:05.926
Shit.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.683
How you doing, Eric?

07:16.562 --> 07:19.273
I heard that you moved in with your mom.

07:20.733 --> 07:24.111
How's that going for you?
Everything all right?

07:24.195 --> 07:29.408
Got no job, your partner thinks
that I killed your brother.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.079
Yeah, I know he's putting
the squeeze on you.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.209
Maybe he thinks you know something.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.225
I can put a word in for you.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.686
Yeah?

07:57.228 --> 07:59.105
I'd want something in return.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.315
And there it is.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.985
There's someone I wanna find.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.530
He's been running around town,
spouting off about what happened to Danny.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.533
Can't help you.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.868
Fuck you,
you were best friends with Danny.

08:12.952 --> 08:15.287
I figured this guy knew Danny in Miami,
come on.

08:15.371 --> 08:19.083
A lot of people knew Danny in Miami,
I don't know who you're talking about.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.507
Still gonna help me, or no?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.053
Tell you what...

08:31.470 --> 08:33.222
you keep your ears open,

08:33.305 --> 08:36.475
and if you can help me,
I will talk to Marco.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.484
What's that?

08:45.568 --> 08:50.823
That is a 2006 MerCruiser 350 engine,

08:50.906 --> 08:56.162
which, if I can get it up and running,
could fetch me seven grand.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.414
-No shit.
-Uh-huh.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.667
Guess what? I'll show you what to do.
You're gonna help me fix it.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.920
And we split the seven grand
down the middle?

09:06.505 --> 09:09.967
Are you fucking nuts?
This is your job, okay?

09:10.051 --> 09:13.345
I'm your boss.
You're gonna do what I tell you to do.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.561
Oh, right, you saw me take a little swig,

09:20.644 --> 09:23.773
so now you think you can
fucking leverage me, is that it?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.734
-Sixty-forty.
-No fucking way.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.111
Fine... do it yourself.

09:31.864 --> 09:33.407
Here's your mail.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.496
Hey, just so you know, asshole...

09:39.538 --> 09:43.084
-I never was gonna tell your wife.
-Uh-huh.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.501
Oh, fuck.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.424
Now, this commercial will emphasize
your roots in the Keys,

10:32.508 --> 10:34.927
your history, your family.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.304
- Where did you get those pictures?
- From Mom.

10:37.388 --> 10:41.183
We were thinking about the tag
in the end, for the spot:

10:41.267 --> 10:43.602
"John Rayburn: Change for the better."

10:43.978 --> 10:46.814
- I think that the font should be bigger.
- We can fix that.

10:47.273 --> 10:49.275
What do you think?

10:54.155 --> 10:57.074
-John?
-Yeah, that's fine.

10:57.158 --> 11:00.828
Okay. So, what kind of buy
are we talking about?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.080
What do you suggest?

11:04.623 --> 11:07.209
I could put together a proposal.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.795
What kind of budget are you thinking?

11:09.879 --> 11:13.424
I'll put you together with our financial
director. You guys can work it out.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.051
Hey, Bonnie,
can you get together with Jack on this?

11:16.135 --> 11:18.512
- Of course.
- Thank you.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.437
Aguirre's people are spending a fortune
on advertising.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.440
-We have to do this.
-So, do it.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.109
Campaign ads cost money, John.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.655
What about Roy Gilbert?

11:36.947 --> 11:40.451
-He hasn't come through with the funds.
-Why the fuck not?

11:40.868 --> 11:45.039
Due diligence, I guess. Just wants
to make sure he's backing the right guy.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.961
-Get him to write the fucking check.
-I'm working on it.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.338
Just do it.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.506
Convince him.

12:09.939 --> 12:11.899
Hey, dude, what's up?

12:12.775 --> 12:15.694
Hey, you want some breakfast?
It's on me, my treat. Come on.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.279
-I don't want breakfast
-Try these, these pancakes--

12:17.363 --> 12:23.118
I don't want fucking breakfast. I could
get busted just talking to you here.

12:23.202 --> 12:25.371
Somebody is a little paranoid.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.581
Yeah, I am.

12:27.665 --> 12:31.126
Come on, dude, chill.
Everything is cool. Everything is--

12:31.210 --> 12:36.882
Is not cool. John Rayburn just showed up
asking me questions, all about you.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.594
Oh, yeah, what did he say?

12:41.095 --> 12:43.430
You've been running your mouth off
about Danny.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.432
Yeah, and what did you say?

12:46.475 --> 12:49.186
Fuck you. I didn't say a fucking word.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.149
All right, then. All right, then, so we
got nothing to worry about. All right?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.277
Why is he asking me questions about you?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.742
Because I've been poking the bear.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.162
You out of your mind?

13:07.246 --> 13:12.543
Dude, they realize I was at that motel,
you know, they're gonna just screw me.

13:12.626 --> 13:16.171
Oh, dude, just chill. Chill the fuck down.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.048
I didn't talk about you.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.843
Jesus Christ, you're fucking crazy, man.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.221
Yeah. Yeah, I'm crazy.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.099
But I feel a big payday coming.
This is the big one, man.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.852
-I can feel it, I'm telling you.
-Stop this fucking shit.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.979
Don't tell me
what to fucking do, motherfucker.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.439
I will end you.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.315
Fucking--

13:36.233 --> 13:37.609
Okay.

13:40.446 --> 13:44.408
Come on, you gotta try these pancakes,
man. It's so fucking good. Mm.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.675
Hey.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.053
Hi.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.222
I have to paint a nursery.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.141
-Expecting?
-Yeah.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.018
That's great, man.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.978
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.688
Yeah. Pink or blue?

14:14.772 --> 14:17.941
Um-- We, uh--
We actually don't know the sex yet.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.694
In that case, how about a pale green?

14:21.445 --> 14:23.238
They say it's a calm color.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.532
Calm would be good.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.536
You don't recognize me, do you?

14:31.538 --> 14:34.833
Oh, right. Yeah, we go to the--
You're in the same...

14:36.210 --> 14:37.628
-How's it going?
-Good.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.004
-Good?
-Yeah.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.051
Well, I gotta get to work here.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.178
-Sure.
-So...

14:46.261 --> 14:47.137
Listen.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.434
I know you only go to the meetings
because you got a nudge from the judge.

14:52.518 --> 14:53.560
Yeah, that's right.

14:53.644 --> 14:58.232
-But if you ever need someone to talk to--
-I don't. Okay, okay, thank you.

15:00.818 --> 15:02.194
Cashier's up front.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.285
Detective.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.791
Sheriff.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.546
Where are we on the Rayburn homicide?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.882
I've been working Eric O'Bannon.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.635
Is he a credible suspect?

15:28.011 --> 15:31.473
I think he's a fucking punk,
but I don't think he's a killer, so--

15:31.557 --> 15:32.766
Why waste your time?

15:33.559 --> 15:36.186
Well, I think he's lying
about what he knows,

15:36.270 --> 15:37.646
and I'd like to find out why.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.440
Mm.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.569
What about the Red Reef Motel?

15:44.069 --> 15:46.071
-The Red Reef?
-Yeah.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.031
We considered that clear.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.116
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.034
Lowry sent somebody to take out
Danny Rayburn.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.327
Rayburn got the drop.

15:54.163 --> 15:56.331
Yeah, I've been going over the, um--

15:57.499 --> 15:59.751
The case file. There are issues.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.964
You've been going over the case file?

16:05.340 --> 16:07.259
Yeah. You got a problem
with that, Detective?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.054
Now, these issues...

16:11.722 --> 16:14.183
you sure they don't have anything
to do with your campaign?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.311
You think this is political?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.354
I'm just asking.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.234
You've been partners with Rayburn
for a long time, engaged to his sister,

16:24.443 --> 16:28.030
-whole nine yards--
-That has no bearing on the investigation.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.033
Just remember, Detective...

16:31.700 --> 16:32.826
you and me...

16:33.911 --> 16:35.370
we got history, too.

16:40.584 --> 16:41.710
As I said...

16:42.920 --> 16:44.087
there are issues.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.142
Hey.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.649
Hey, Chelsea.

17:06.860 --> 17:07.945
Thank you for meeting me.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.114
I heard you moved to New York.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.784
I did, but it didn't work out.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.245
Sorry to hear that.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.288
Ah, it's... probably for the best.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.709
You wanted to ask me something?

17:23.919 --> 17:25.587
I know it's out of left field.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.258
It's a legal thing.

17:30.842 --> 17:34.304
-What's it got to do with me?
-Nothing, nothing. It's, um...

17:35.389 --> 17:37.349
Trying to find some information out
about a woman.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.685
I think she was assaulted by her husband.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.479
She came here to the hospital?

17:42.688 --> 17:44.231
I don't know.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.899
Why don't you ask her?

17:46.608 --> 17:48.610
Because she's too scared to talk.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.362
And I think the guy is intimidating her.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.242
I thought maybe you could look into it,
see if she had been treated here.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.119
Her name is Pamela Aguirre.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.413
That kind of stuff is confidential.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.039
You know that.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.752
It would never come back to you.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.174
You're asking me to break the law.

18:13.885 --> 18:17.055
Only because I think the police
may have covered it up.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.437
Our whole life you never go out
of your way to say two words to me.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.939
You come here asking me for this?

18:30.027 --> 18:32.487
I'm sorry. I don't know where else to go.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.120
Her name is Pamela Aguirre
if you could just look into it.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.580
Bye, Meg.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.925
Janey.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.012
Hi.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.806
I'll see you guys later.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.810
What are you doing here?

19:03.894 --> 19:06.480
Well, I just thought
maybe we could get a coffee or something.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.900
I don't-- I don't know.
I've got a lot of homework today.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.526
Sure.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.944
Yeah, it's just that...

19:13.737 --> 19:18.367
Nolan and me, we're finally here
after all these years. And...

19:19.534 --> 19:21.411
I got a lot of questions.

19:24.623 --> 19:28.460
Seemed like maybe
you had some questions, too.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.536
Oh, man.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.372
- Fuck.
- What's the matter?

20:05.956 --> 20:07.082
You got a problem?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.584
Yeah. I got a flat.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.087
Oh, I see that. Oh, shit.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.507
What, you need some help?

20:23.348 --> 20:26.143
- You ready?
- Almost.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.145
It's gonna look beautiful.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.734
Did I tell you? Huh?

20:34.025 --> 20:36.653
God, man. Look how it sits on you.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.990
Have you done any modeling?

20:40.407 --> 20:43.410
Me? Come on.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.703
Well, all you need is pictures.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.705
I know this guy in Miami.
He shot my album cover.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.040
And he'd, like, flip for you.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.375
You recorded an album?

20:50.542 --> 20:53.086
-Yeah, I do a little singing.
-Huh.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.464
Nolan never mentioned that to me.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.258
Yeah, well,
it's kind of one of those things.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.344
The record company went bust or something.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.431
And the record never came out.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.642
If you want,
I can play it for you sometime.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.936
Yeah, that would be really cool.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.188
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.026
Well, this is just too much.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.694
My parents would kill me.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.738
Yeah. I understand.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.623
I can put it back for you.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.500
All right, thanks.

21:34.544 --> 21:37.923
Oh, man. I can't thank you enough.
AAA's like an hour down here.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.841
Oh, hey, don't mention it.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.723
-You want a beer?
-No. Too early for me.

21:54.773 --> 21:56.358
You voting for him?

21:57.818 --> 22:01.071
Yep. Kind of have to.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.240
He's my husband.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.744
You know, I--
I just met him the other day.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.496
What a great guy.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.790
Tragedy about the brother, though.

22:12.666 --> 22:15.460
Yeah. Yeah, that was tough
on the whole family.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.837
Hm.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.431
Just-- You know what? I just--

22:28.515 --> 22:30.350
I just can't imagine...

22:31.434 --> 22:33.937
having to run for office
with all that going on.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.440
How do you mean?

22:37.649 --> 22:39.234
The way I heard it tell...

22:40.151 --> 22:41.778
the brother was running dope,

22:41.861 --> 22:45.198
and then killed a guy,
and then got burned up by a drug smuggler?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.201
That had nothing to do with John.

22:48.285 --> 22:51.580
Oh, sure.
I mean, you and I know that.

22:51.788 --> 22:56.209
But I'm betting if somebody was
aiming to soil your husband's good name,

22:56.293 --> 22:58.628
they could find a way to tie him into it.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.506
-No, I don't think so.
-No?

23:02.632 --> 23:05.010
You never know what else is out there.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.930
People start digging in,
you'd be surprised the dirt they find.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.185
How's the tire coming?

23:15.228 --> 23:16.396
Almost there.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.701
Thanks.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.379
My parents don't usually like me
drinking coffee.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.133
That should be the least of their worries.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.971
Do you smoke weed?

23:51.890 --> 23:54.225
I do. It's no big deal.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.772
I'm sure your folks get stoned
from time to time.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.025
Oh, you don't know my parents.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.279
Right. Well...

24:07.530 --> 24:09.074
I got something for you.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.130
Go on. Just take it. It's yours.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.676
But it's so expensive.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.177
I can't just accept this.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.722
-Don't worry about it.
-You just walked out with it?

24:34.599 --> 24:36.601
Of course not. I got a credit card.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.899
If my parents find out, they'll kill me.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.652
Then I guess you shouldn't tell them.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.375
So, what's the deal with you?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.210
What do you mean?

25:02.919 --> 25:04.671
Why did you stay away all these years?

25:04.879 --> 25:06.631
Nobody talks about it.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.633
Hm.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.722
-Why?
-Are you sure you wanna know all this?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.367
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.869
I went with green.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.203
It's calm.

25:41.124 --> 25:42.333
Maybe we should wait.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.212
Why? What's going on?

25:46.921 --> 25:48.757
I'm waiting on a couple tests.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.426
What do you mean tests?
I thought that the last checkup was...

25:51.509 --> 25:53.720
You know, everything was normal.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.555
I've been having headaches.

25:55.764 --> 25:59.267
My blood pressure has been high,
and my hands and feet have been swelling.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.895
Okay, what does that mean?

26:02.103 --> 26:04.355
I didn't want to worry you
in case it's all nothing.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.441
What could it mean?

26:06.524 --> 26:10.320
They're testing me for a couple of things.

26:13.948 --> 26:17.035
-Like?
-Preeclampsia.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.163
What--? What is that?

26:20.955 --> 26:22.457
It's not good.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.966
How bad is not good?

26:32.592 --> 26:35.428
Let's just hold off
painting the room, okay?

26:44.354 --> 26:46.773
- You like it with the mushrooms?
- It's good this time.

26:46.940 --> 26:47.857
Hello.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.609
Hey, sweetie.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.361
You want me to make you a plate?

26:51.444 --> 26:54.364
-I already ate.
-Oh, okay.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.116
Hey, wait. Before you go...

26:58.159 --> 27:01.162
Aunt Meg called. We're going to dinner
at the inn tomorrow night.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.039
Do we have to go?

27:04.040 --> 27:06.251
Yes, we do.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.629
We haven't all gotten together
since she's been back. It'll be nice.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.047
Hey, how was your day?

27:11.464 --> 27:12.882
Fine.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.261
-What happened?
-I went to school.

27:16.845 --> 27:19.097
Anything interesting happen
at school today?

27:19.806 --> 27:22.016
I'm not a suspect, Dad.
You don't have to interrogate me.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.768
Hey.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.985
Okay, well, I've got homework.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.612
-Can I be excused?
-Yes, go do your homework.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.795
How was your day?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.589
It was pretty quiet.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.009
I went for a run at Founders.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.303
And when I came back I had a flat tire.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.972
You had a flat tire?
Why didn't you call me?

28:01.139 --> 28:04.183
I would have, but there was this guy
there and he offered to change it.

28:04.809 --> 28:07.478
-Well, good.
-No, he creeped me out.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.858
-What do you mean, creeped you out?
-He said he knew you.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.569
But there was something about him.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.779
He was talking about Danny
and the campaign.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.074
And how there was more dirt out there
on you than people knew.

29:38.736 --> 29:43.449
- Honey, why didn't you call me?
- I was going through some stuff, you know?

29:44.117 --> 29:46.661
I just didn't want to worry you anymore.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.582
I don't know, I just...

29:51.958 --> 29:55.336
Guess I felt sort of helpless, you know?

29:57.130 --> 29:59.924
-You're not helpless, Kevin.
-I mean, the arrest,

30:00.216 --> 30:02.135
and now this pregnancy.

30:02.218 --> 30:06.347
Look, I know Belle thinks I don't always
take your problems seriously enough--

30:06.431 --> 30:09.058
-Mom--
-But she doesn't know you like I do.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.978
You're gonna be fine.
You always have been.

30:14.564 --> 30:17.317
I remember when
you taught yourself to ride that bicycle.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.028
-Please, not the bike story, Mom--
-Yes. You said

30:20.111 --> 30:22.905
you were gonna teach yourself
to ride a bike, and you did.

30:24.407 --> 30:25.616
From that moment on,

30:26.034 --> 30:28.244
I knew what kind of man you were.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.163
Mom, I was six.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.998
Yeah.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.083
And I knew you'd be just fine.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.837
I knew I'd never have to worry
about you.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.466
Your dad felt the same way.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.719
Yeah?

30:46.596 --> 30:49.140
He never said anything about it.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.602
Well,

30:53.186 --> 30:55.271
that wasn't his way.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.149
But your father was proud of you.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.444
He always was.

31:10.745 --> 31:13.206
Hey. Prints came back
on that tire iron.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.917
Guy's name is Ozzy Delveccio.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.200
Tell me something,

32:31.284 --> 32:35.496
how does a guy like Danny Rayburn,
who knows someone is coming for him,

32:35.580 --> 32:37.707
wait here alone without a weapon?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.878
Doesn't make sense.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.546
Okay, so...

32:44.797 --> 32:48.009
the guy walks in, and he's a fucking pro,

32:48.092 --> 32:52.388
but his bullet ends up
high on the wall. Why?

32:55.808 --> 32:58.519
Maybe Danny was hiding
in the bathroom, right?

32:58.603 --> 33:01.481
The guy comes in, Danny surprises him,

33:01.564 --> 33:05.193
gun goes off.
Danny brains him, guy ends up here.

33:06.944 --> 33:09.197
Still doesn't explain
why he was unarmed.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.827
Maybe he didn't need to be.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.121
I don't follow.

33:18.206 --> 33:21.042
Well, maybe Danny
didn't need to be armed,

33:21.501 --> 33:23.127
somebody else was.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.340
So you think

33:27.632 --> 33:29.675
someone was in here with Danny?

33:30.218 --> 33:34.138
John already made a statement
saying he stopped by here

33:34.222 --> 33:36.182
looking for Danny.

33:37.558 --> 33:41.020
If he was in the room,
it would explain a lot.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.688
No, no, no. No.

33:43.648 --> 33:46.192
None of this makes sense, all right?

33:47.235 --> 33:49.487
I've known John a long time.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.657
-John's a good man.
-And a good man does what he has to

33:52.740 --> 33:53.908
-to protect his loved ones.
-No way, no.

33:53.991 --> 33:57.453
Family or no family,
John is still a cop, period.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.289
If Danny wasn't alone,

34:00.790 --> 34:03.167
it had to be somebody else.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.141
Ozzy Delveccio.

34:20.184 --> 34:21.852
I don't know him.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.190
You got alcohol in those bags?
You been drinking?

34:26.274 --> 34:29.235
You know that's a parole violation,
don't you?

34:29.318 --> 34:31.112
You tell me where the fuck he is.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.656
I'm not screwing around here.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.451
I'll send your ass back to prison so fast
it will make your head spin. Where is he?

34:41.330 --> 34:45.084
That condition, I read about it online.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.755
-It scared the shit out of me.
-Yeah, well,

34:49.839 --> 34:51.841
that's why I didn't tell you.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.677
But I was wrong. I've been asking
you to be straight with me

34:54.760 --> 34:56.262
and I should have done the same.

34:59.265 --> 35:02.602
I got a default notice
in the mail yesterday.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.896
-On the boatyard.
-What does that mean?

35:06.522 --> 35:09.317
If I don't get current,
they're gonna foreclose.

35:12.653 --> 35:15.489
I'm gonna take care of it,
it's gonna be all right.

35:20.620 --> 35:24.457
Have I ever told you about
when I was six,

35:24.540 --> 35:27.376
I learned how to ride a bike by myself,
did I tell you this?

35:28.169 --> 35:29.754
I was six years old, right?

35:30.630 --> 35:33.633
I run outside, I get on this bike
on the driveway.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.260
Get on this fucking bike
and I fall off right away.

35:36.344 --> 35:38.512
I get back on it, and I fall off.

35:38.596 --> 35:41.349
I go again, just over and over again.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.061
I bust open my head, just--
I'm just covered in blood, right,

35:45.144 --> 35:47.229
but by the end of that day,

35:47.730 --> 35:52.276
I was riding that fucking bike, okay?
You understand what I am saying?

35:53.486 --> 35:57.239
-Where was your father? Your mom?
-What? That's not the point.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.742
-They weren't there for you.
-This isn't about my parents.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.661
This is about me.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.539
What?

36:06.499 --> 36:09.043
You think that's a happy ending?

36:09.669 --> 36:11.504
It's not.

36:38.155 --> 36:41.325
Ozzy Delveccio.

36:41.534 --> 36:43.327
Oh, shit.

36:43.411 --> 36:45.287
Ain't this a small town, huh?

36:46.205 --> 36:48.374
I know you were arrested
with my brother.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.504
What the fuck
are you doing down here?

36:57.758 --> 37:00.386
Your fucking brother told me
that this was paradise.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.556
I just wanted to see for myself.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.977
What else did my brother tell you?

37:09.311 --> 37:11.647
Gosh, you know Danny,

37:11.731 --> 37:14.608
always full of stories about his family.

37:17.278 --> 37:21.115
Crazy thing is, you just,
you never knew which ones were true.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.246
You're gonna leave town, Ozzy.

37:29.123 --> 37:31.792
-Today.
-Oh, come on, man, I'd really rather not.

37:31.876 --> 37:34.503
-I really like it here.
-You make me say it one more time

37:34.587 --> 37:37.006
I won't be so polite.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

37:37.465 --> 37:40.843
All right, okay, okay. Look,
I don't want any trouble, all right?

37:47.725 --> 37:49.059
Hey.

37:49.518 --> 37:52.229
Don't--? Don't you wanna
ask me what I want?

37:54.565 --> 37:56.817
I don't give a fuck what you want.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.802
Hey, come in.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.810
You didn't get these records from me.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.731
Okay.

38:38.192 --> 38:40.486
She was Sheriff Aguirre's ex,
wasn't she?

38:42.446 --> 38:43.739
Yeah.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.952
Well, if he did this to her,
then the son of a bitch belongs in jail.

38:49.787 --> 38:51.497
Hey, Chelsea.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.793
I know you don't think much of my family.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.713
Thank you for doing this.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.802
John looked out for my brother,
I owe him one.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.307
Hope this does what you need it to.

39:23.654 --> 39:27.283
Maybe dinner tonight
is not such a great idea, Meggie.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.409
Why not?

39:28.951 --> 39:33.330
Oh, everyone's so busy, I just don't
want it to feel like an obligation.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.166
Mom, come on, we want to see you.

39:38.544 --> 39:42.131
Well, then maybe
it's just me that doesn't feel up to it.

39:43.924 --> 39:45.467
You're gonna enjoy it.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.804
Besides, we haven't had the whole
family together since I got back.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.348
<i>...Sheriff Aguirre's</i>
<i>then-wife, Pamela Ortiz.</i>

39:51.432 --> 39:54.435

<i>Sheriff Aguirre,</i>

- That's terrible.

40:31.847 --> 40:34.558
<i>-In lighter news, Miami residents...</i>
-Yeah.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.653
There he is.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.906
- Excuse me, Sheriff?
- Sheriff Aguirre.

40:48.989 --> 40:52.076
- Sheriff?
- Do you have a statement for us?

40:52.159 --> 40:53.911
Sheriff Aguirre, a statement, please?

40:53.994 --> 40:56.372
- Sheriff Aguirre?
- What of the allegations, sir?

40:56.455 --> 40:57.957
What about the medical records.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.291
Are the allegations true?

40:59.375 --> 41:02.544
-Can you make a comment, sir?
-I only have this to say, then I won't

41:02.628 --> 41:07.549
be commenting any further.
These allegations are entirely unfounded.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.176
Completely false.

41:09.802 --> 41:11.679
If anything like this would have occurred,

41:11.762 --> 41:13.847
an incident report
would have been filed.

41:13.931 --> 41:15.140
There is none.

41:15.391 --> 41:20.187
Seven years ago, my ex-wife and I
went through a difficult divorce.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.856
She was in the care of a psychiatrist,

41:22.940 --> 41:25.109
and she was struggling
with substance abuse

41:25.192 --> 41:27.611
when she had an accident in our home.

41:28.028 --> 41:32.950
<i>Now I deeply regret that this private</i>
<i>matter has been made public in this way.</i>

41:34.284 --> 41:36.203
<i>That's all I'm gonna say about it.</i>

41:36.286 --> 41:38.205
- <i>In other news, a three-alarm fire--</i>
- Hey.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.581
Hey.

41:39.665 --> 41:42.292
-So, did the doctor call?
-He did.

41:42.376 --> 41:43.877
The tests were all negative.

41:44.962 --> 41:48.007
-Oh, God, really?
-Really.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.634
-So there's nothing to worry about?
-Nothing.

41:50.718 --> 41:52.344
He's fine.

41:53.429 --> 41:54.596
He?

41:54.680 --> 41:57.975
-Yeah.
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

42:00.102 --> 42:02.730
We should choose a real color.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.523
Oh.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.695
How does it feel?

42:09.987 --> 42:13.240
No drug in the world like winning.

42:14.283 --> 42:15.659
We haven't won anything yet.

42:15.743 --> 42:17.327
Oh, you're on your way.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.831
Nobody will ever look at Aguirre
the same again.

42:21.749 --> 42:23.333
Nicely done.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.795
It'll buy you a few buttons.

42:29.673 --> 42:31.508
Jeez.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.472
You know a single donor
can only give 500 bucks apiece?

42:36.555 --> 42:40.059
Yes, I know. You've got a friend
who's got a lot of friends.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.604
Okay, I'm gonna need a list of donors.

42:44.313 --> 42:45.731
I'll get it for you.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.151
You seem ambivalent.

42:51.445 --> 42:52.863
I...

42:54.198 --> 42:55.991
What if Aguirre is telling the truth?

42:56.867 --> 42:58.243
Well...

42:58.577 --> 43:00.496
what if he wasn't?

43:01.455 --> 43:04.291
Even still, it doesn't sit right with me.

43:06.460 --> 43:10.464
What do you know about
how your father bought the inn?

43:12.174 --> 43:14.885
Well, he was getting out of the Navy,

43:14.968 --> 43:17.679
and he found a piece of property
that he liked, so he bought it.

43:18.097 --> 43:20.182
And then he called my mom,
and she came...

43:22.226 --> 43:23.477
and they built it together.

43:23.602 --> 43:25.437
That's what they told you, huh?

43:28.774 --> 43:30.275
What do you mean?

43:31.318 --> 43:34.696
How can a young man,
just out of the service, no money,

43:34.780 --> 43:39.326
no job, afford to buy oceanfront property
down here?

43:42.871 --> 43:45.082
Your father was principled,

43:45.874 --> 43:47.543
but he was also determined.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.255
May not have sat right with him either...

43:53.215 --> 43:55.551
but he knew what he wanted for his family,

43:56.552 --> 43:58.679
and he did what he had to do.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.822
Sally?

44:18.198 --> 44:20.200
- Wow, this looks gorgeous.
- Oh.

44:20.909 --> 44:23.620
Oh, I'm so happy to see you all here.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.123
Hey, Janey.

44:28.792 --> 44:31.044
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, Ben.

44:33.297 --> 44:35.090
Oh, I didn't know you were coming.

44:35.966 --> 44:38.093
Why wouldn't he come
to a family dinner?

44:38.510 --> 44:39.845
He's family.

44:40.971 --> 44:43.932
Well, of course he is, I-- I just, um...

44:44.558 --> 44:46.018
Just didn't know.

44:47.644 --> 44:48.896
Whatever.

44:49.646 --> 44:51.023
Janey.

44:51.315 --> 44:53.984
-Don't talk to your grandmother like...
-Well, let me set a place.

45:00.949 --> 45:01.992
Hey.

45:03.243 --> 45:04.286
Hey.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.872
Pour me a bourbon, we're celebrating.

45:07.247 --> 45:08.832
What are we celebrating?

45:08.957 --> 45:10.000
Gilbert came through.

45:11.919 --> 45:12.961
How much?

45:13.045 --> 45:15.881
We can buy airtime, billboards...

45:16.548 --> 45:17.841
We're flush.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.844
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. You too.

45:21.428 --> 45:22.721
Did you hear about Aguirre?

45:24.348 --> 45:26.099
Yeah, it's weird, right?

45:26.266 --> 45:28.977
I've known Franco a long time.
That's more than weird, that's shocking.

45:29.686 --> 45:33.148
Well, you never know what happens
behind closed doors.

45:37.110 --> 45:39.321
Hey, listen, I don't want to exploit
any of that.

45:39.655 --> 45:41.490
That's his problem, not ours.

45:42.658 --> 45:44.034
Sure.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.455
See you out there.

46:17.609 --> 46:19.486
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

46:28.704 --> 46:29.788
You going to your meetings?

46:31.039 --> 46:33.458
I'm your attorney,
I'm trying to keep you out of jail.

46:33.542 --> 46:35.919
Yes, I'm going to the meetings.

46:36.003 --> 46:37.671
Perfect attendance.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.549
Best donuts I ever had.

46:41.842 --> 46:43.135
Just keep going.

46:43.677 --> 46:45.178
Yes, Counselor.

46:51.518 --> 46:52.644
Meg Rayburn.

46:53.645 --> 46:55.147
Miss Ortiz.

46:56.481 --> 46:59.026
Yes. Uh...

46:59.109 --> 47:00.694
I can meet you later.

47:39.274 --> 47:42.027
I have a little announcement
to make before we start.

47:42.110 --> 47:43.236
Um...

47:43.320 --> 47:47.574
Mom, sorry that Belle didn't come.
She's fine. She's just resting.

47:48.158 --> 47:49.993
We heard from our doctor today,

47:50.368 --> 47:56.833
and we found out that the newest member
of the Rayburn family is going to be a...

47:59.461 --> 48:02.255
Kev, come on, you're killing us.
Don't do this.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.507
A boy.

48:05.008 --> 48:06.426
Fantastic!

48:06.968 --> 48:08.261
Congratulations.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.181
Aw. Your father would be so thrilled.

48:11.264 --> 48:12.557
What about Danny?

48:13.767 --> 48:16.812
-Think he would have been thrilled?
-What?

48:17.229 --> 48:19.147
When Danny had a son,
you didn't give a shit.

48:20.232 --> 48:21.483
Hey!

48:28.406 --> 48:29.783
- Okay.
- Janey.

48:34.079 --> 48:35.956
She's been acting weird all day.

48:42.671 --> 48:44.422
Maybe you wanna go in there.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.761
-What is going on?
-I know what you did.

48:50.679 --> 48:53.056
-What did I do?
-To Danny,

48:53.306 --> 48:55.058
to Nolan, to Eve.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.018
She told me the truth about you.

48:57.394 --> 48:59.771
Oh. Well, what did she tell you?

48:59.855 --> 49:01.189
You didn't want her to have Nolan.

49:01.648 --> 49:04.860
-Look, Janey, I know it's--
-And then you sent them money

49:04.985 --> 49:06.069
to stay away from us.

49:06.194 --> 49:09.030
-It was a little more complicated--
-So, you did force them to stay away?

49:09.114 --> 49:10.532
You know what, you're young,

49:10.615 --> 49:13.493
there is no way you can
possibly understand this, honey.

49:13.577 --> 49:15.412
I can't believe how much bullshit
you fed us.

49:15.537 --> 49:17.622
- Don't say that.
- Everything you told us about family

49:17.706 --> 49:18.999
-is a lie.
-No, it's not.

49:19.082 --> 49:23.295
Yeah, this family treated Danny like shit
for years. Is that a lie?

49:23.420 --> 49:25.338
You know nothing about it.

49:25.422 --> 49:28.258
- Oh, yes, I do. He hated you.
- No.

49:28.383 --> 49:29.384
He hated Papa Ray.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.469
- You know what?
- He hated everybody in this family.

49:31.553 --> 49:33.513
-I'm not gonna listen to this anymore.
-He hated you.

49:33.597 --> 49:35.640
- He hated you and you killed him.
- Stop it!

50:16.389 --> 50:17.891
Miss Ortiz.

50:23.021 --> 50:25.190
You can't imagine
living with a man like that.

50:26.816 --> 50:28.443
I'm so sorry.

50:29.569 --> 50:30.946
When the story broke...

50:32.030 --> 50:34.991
I was terrified. I thought
he was gonna come after me.

50:35.867 --> 50:37.994
But then I realized he couldn't.

50:38.912 --> 50:40.413
It was too public.

50:41.081 --> 50:44.459
And for the first time in years,
I felt safe.

50:48.171 --> 50:50.715
But after what he said about me on TV,

50:51.174 --> 50:54.678
you need to know,
you only got half the story.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.805
What do you mean?

50:57.639 --> 51:01.351
There's a reason why the 911 call
was never reported.

51:03.603 --> 51:05.146
Did the police show up?

51:05.689 --> 51:06.856
Yes.

51:07.107 --> 51:10.735
That night the local PD
came to the house.

51:11.444 --> 51:14.614
I was scared.
I didn't tell the officer much.

51:16.032 --> 51:17.951
Afterwards, my husband walked him out,

51:18.493 --> 51:21.121
and no one ever
followed up on me again.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.457
You think there was
some kind of cover-up?

51:27.002 --> 51:28.420
All I know...

51:28.920 --> 51:33.717
a short time later that officer was hired
by the Monroe County Sheriff Department.

51:35.260 --> 51:38.596
So, your husband gave him a job. That's
why there was never an incident report.

51:39.472 --> 51:41.850
That's the only way
I can make sense of it.

51:43.268 --> 51:45.228
Do you remember the name of that officer?

51:46.146 --> 51:47.981
Yeah, I remember his name.

51:48.857 --> 51:50.233
It was Diaz.

51:50.692 --> 51:52.485
Marco Diaz.

51:59.826 --> 52:01.119
Janey?

52:01.202 --> 52:03.872
- Sweetie, wait up.
- Hey, hey, wait a second!

52:03.955 --> 52:05.749
Listen to me.
I know you're upset.

52:05.832 --> 52:07.667
But you don't know
what the conversation was--

52:07.751 --> 52:10.754
It doesn't fucking matter.
Sally can fuck up her own family.

52:10.837 --> 52:12.881
I am not gonna let her do it to mine.

52:27.562 --> 52:28.980
What's wrong?

52:34.652 --> 52:36.237
My family.

52:37.447 --> 52:38.990
What about them?

52:45.413 --> 52:46.790
I can't do this.

52:48.208 --> 52:49.584
Do what?

52:52.087 --> 52:53.838
I can't be a father.

52:57.467 --> 52:59.594
I'm gonna fuck this kid up.

53:03.515 --> 53:04.891
I can't do this.

53:05.517 --> 53:07.268
Kevin.

53:07.811 --> 53:09.604
Kevin, wait.

54:32.437 --> 54:34.063
Um...

54:35.690 --> 54:36.733
Come on in.

54:38.067 --> 54:39.486
Come on in.

54:42.739 --> 54:44.491
-Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

55:25.740 --> 55:28.535
I guess I got your attention now, huh?

55:38.878 --> 55:42.173
So, what, you--?
You want to talk first, or should I?

55:44.551 --> 55:45.885
Yeah.

55:47.178 --> 55:49.264
Yeah.
