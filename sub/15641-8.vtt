WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.420
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor...</i>

00:02.544 --> 00:05.388
I thought we were gonna stop.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.675
The numbers came in
for the calendar shoot. They're huge.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.969
- I wanted to see if you got my flowers.
- Those were from you?

00:10.135 --> 00:12.513
Did you think
the flowers were from Pete?

00:12.679 --> 00:16.104
-It's not all there but I'm working on it.
- Not even close and time's running out.

00:16.265 --> 00:19.520
- You put me in a crappy spot.
- I'm looking for something important.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.359
- Who's Ahsha?
- I really have to go.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.865
You ruined the rotation.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.154
Instead of riding me,
why don't you focus on Terrence?

00:25.317 --> 00:27.285
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He wants to be traded.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.243
He didn't just miss one game.
He didn't even get on the plane.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.079
It's all on you now.
Derek Roman can give a good time.

00:33.242 --> 00:35.461
Not everybody knows
if he can get his act together.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.338
Having people to push you in the right
direction makes all the difference

00:38.497 --> 00:40.374
and I feel like I have that person.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.885
Nice interview.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.651
Thank you.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.816
Wait until you try this.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.615
These cows were raised
better than I was.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.872
Did you notice the silverware?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.752
You think because you carved
a J into all the silverware,

01:16.910 --> 01:20.710
I'm supposed to pretend
that I don't want to stab you with it?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.294
Yes.

01:24.251 --> 01:28.802
- Fine. You want to get into this?
- Love to.

01:28.964 --> 01:32.559
But you brought us to the one place
you knew I wouldn't be able to.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.725
Filets okay, sir?

01:39.891 --> 01:42.861
Please escort everyone out
with my sincerest apologies

01:44.146 --> 01:45.898
and a bottle of our best wine.

01:46.023 --> 01:50.620
- Sir, I...
- Everyone. Staff too.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.031
Got it.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.922
I should have told you
about the trade, okay?

02:06.918 --> 02:10.013
But I didn't want you to worry until
I knew the deal was a real possibility.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.174
You've no clue what this is about.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.389
Do you know how
I keep control of the girls?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.929
- Fear?
- Perception.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.146
You made me look like a fool.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.482
I heard about your deal from Ahsha
in front of everyone.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.989
- It was humiliating.
- Come on.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.947
You're upset because Indiana is far
and what that might mean for us.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.702
Get over yourself.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.244
I have worked just as hard as you
to get where I am

02:36.406 --> 02:40.786
and you damaged that,
all because you kept me in the dark.

02:42.996 --> 02:48.173
The one person
I thought had my back didn't.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.133
So you're mad
about the Devil Girls

02:50.295 --> 02:53.720
and not that I might be moving
halfway across the country?

02:59.054 --> 03:01.056
My steak is getting cold.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.577
Listen up, y'all. Devils email.
If you want to represent the Devils

03:13.735 --> 03:15.737
at the All-Star game,
submit your name to Olivia.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.991
Kamikaze mission.
Jelena gets voted in every year.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.785
Can't remember the last girl
who even tried.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.080
What about you, Care Bear?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.957
- Hello?
- Huh?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.010
Sorry. Olivia and Pete called me

03:31.169 --> 03:34.013
and they want to talk
about the red carpet fight.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.392
I'm so bummed I missed that.
Was it hilarious?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.270
My boyfriend decked
our shooting guard.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.353
- So?
- No. It wasn't hilarious.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.940
Oh, he probably hurt his hand
more than he hurt Derek's face.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.279
- I need to sweat this out.
- You can count on that.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.532
I heard Jelena's got her war paint on.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.034
Everyone, on the floor now!

03:57.863 --> 03:59.706
Hold it.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.170
Hold it, like your job depends on it.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.132
Great. Now we have to start over.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.720
- I think my ankle's sprained.
- You think or you know?

04:19.426 --> 04:24.273
Okay, from the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.021
Okay, girls, time to shut it down.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.316
Go change in the locker room.
Just stretch it out.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.278
Jelena, a word. Go on.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.571
What the hell are you doing?

04:39.738 --> 04:42.287
-It's called practice.
-It's called a lawsuit.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.247
- Are we done here?
- No, but you are.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.912
- I'm pulling you off choreography.
- You can't pull me.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.580
On, I just did.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.334
I know how you run this team.

04:52.501 --> 04:56.472
It's one of the reasons we're as good
as we are, but you are off the rails.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.559
- I heard about Terrence.
- That's none of your business.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.266
Oh, you made it my business.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.305
You better hope Charlie
didn't tear anything in that ankle,

05:05.472 --> 05:08.100
because I swear,
I don't want any more injuries

05:08.266 --> 05:10.644
and I don't do insurance claims.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.780
You can spin this
however you want with the girls,

05:13.939 --> 05:16.283
but I have made my decision.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.239
No one can do what I do.

05:18.401 --> 05:22.326
Oh, I'm sure Desiree will welcome the
challenge, at least until this blows over.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.538
Think of it as one less thing
you have to worry about.

05:27.285 --> 05:32.542
All right. I just hope I can focus
when you come crawling back to me,

05:32.707 --> 05:34.709
come game time.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.308
- That couldn't have been legal.
- Well, you didn't ask for legal.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.934
Oh, this is the life.
Sex, room service.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.695
Don't get me started on that bathtub.
I could spend the whole day in there.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.527
I'm not really a bubble bath
kind of guy.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.067
- Who said you were invited?
- Hey, now.

05:58.233 --> 06:02.158
Oh, those Jacuzzi jets
are calling my name.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.073
These dance classes have me sore
in places I forgot I had.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.992
I can help you find those places.
I think one of them is right...

06:07.158 --> 06:09.536
Is this one of them right there?
Is that one?

06:10.579 --> 06:14.004
Oh, it's all right.
I have to get to the arena anyway.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.167
I have to deal with the punch
between one of my players

06:16.334 --> 06:17.881
and Ahsha's boyfriend.

06:18.044 --> 06:23.471
I talked to her about that.
You and I, we don't talk about that.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.635
Not in this context.
This is separate.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.804
I was just saying...

06:29.222 --> 06:31.600
Even saying her name out loud
makes me think

06:31.766 --> 06:34.110
she could find out about us,
which she can't, ever.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.771
Okay.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.862
Why don't we talk about...
talk about this?

06:39.983 --> 06:42.987
- And then we can talk about this.
- Okay, I'm listening.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.781
- And then we'll talk about this.
- Room service.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.745
- Hey, where are you going?
- Sorry.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.994
Not even you can compete
with veggie sliders.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.755
I have to sign for it
and you're not exactly presentable.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.384
Jesse! Bad timing, but thanks
for dropping by unannounced.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.516
This will just take a second, Buddy.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.767
You've been served.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.150
Next time, think twice about
screwing the mother of my child.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.938
I have no idea
what he's talking about.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.406
I didn't hear a thing.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.317
Sloane, there's nothing going on
between me and Raquel, okay?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.658
- He's totally out of his mind.
- Stop stammering. It's not sexy.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.040
Hey, bring me those sliders
when they get here.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.120
These are for you.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.046
My fans.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.213
It doesn't take talent
to put out a sex tape.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.381
You obviously haven't seen my tape.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.847
You have bounced back to this team
so many times, it's almost impressive,

07:48.009 --> 07:49.761
but I will not be the president
of your fan club

07:49.928 --> 07:51.896
and certainly not the secretary.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.025
Have you ever heard
of negative attention?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.643
There's no such thing.

07:56.810 --> 08:02.613
Really? Tell that to prisoner 8759
from Folsom State prison.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.244
Who knew my fan base extended
all the way to cell block H?

08:06.403 --> 08:09.577
Have you lost your mind?
We're supposed to be in the middle

08:09.739 --> 08:12.117
of a championship race here
and you're fighting!

08:12.283 --> 08:13.660
What if something had happened
to your hand?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.128
I didn't throw a punch.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.004
- What if you got hurt?
- I didn't.

08:17.163 --> 08:22.636
You may be willing to take that risk,
but I am not. Do we get each other?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.468
So what? What happens now?
You looking to press charges?

08:29.634 --> 08:33.229
- One punch for another, what?
- No. I'm good.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.525
Okay. You can go.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.318
Not you.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.327
I'd like to talk to Ahsha. Please.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.489
Yeah, of course.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.042
You need to be careful.

09:03.043 --> 09:08.015
Derek Roman is not someone that
you should be getting tangled up with.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.806
I used to be that guy,

09:11.968 --> 09:17.725
the guy that had everything to lose
and not a clue how to keep it.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.779
I thought things were good
with you and German.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.242
I'm sorry about the scene
at the premiere.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.904
It was unprofessional. It was wrong.
It will never happen again.

09:31.071 --> 09:35.417
If you want to talk about
my personal life, I'm not interested.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.667
You can go.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.686
- Aren't you gonna thank me?
- For what?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.597
Well, I don't know.
For not pressing charges

09:57.764 --> 09:59.607
and not putting your boyfriend
in the hospital? You choose.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.942
Stay the hell away from me.
I mean it. I'm done.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.992
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

10:24.374 --> 10:26.126
It's not a twist top.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
How was your meeting?

10:39.180 --> 10:43.777
Look, I'm sorry for
embarrassing you at work.

10:43.935 --> 10:47.815
Thanks.
I appreciate you taking it back.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.737
Well, I'm sorry it happened at your job,
but I'm not taking it back.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.535
Look, that guy deserved
to get popped.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.041
Popped? Who are you?

10:58.199 --> 11:01.203
If something's bothering you,
you come to me and we talk about it.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.964
That dude is chasing my girlfriend
and bragging about it on camera.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.672
I'm gonna do something about it.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.553
Here. A ticket to tonight's game.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.340
Try not to pop anyone
while you're there.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.183
And that's not all.
Indianapolis is cool.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.351
Wide open spaces, Indy 500.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.020
If you say one more word
about Indiana,

11:27.145 --> 11:29.364
I swear, I'm gonna run
through that glass wall face first.

11:29.522 --> 11:34.369
Think about it.
You could be the queen of Indiana.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.871
When you're done with that ankle,
can you tape his mouth shut?

11:41.451 --> 11:44.125
Stop trying to sell me
on the wonder and splendour.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.335
You couldn't even find Indianapolis
on a map.

11:46.497 --> 11:52.425
Besides, my life, my job,
everything is here.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.180
We knew this was coming
with my contract

11:54.339 --> 11:55.682
being up at the end of the season.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.389
- They made a good offer.
- I already told you.

11:58.551 --> 12:03.478
Why is it a good offer?
I will tell you why.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.018
We used to come in here
to chill before games.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.021
Now I have no choice.
I need the wraps. I need the ice.

12:09.187 --> 12:13.033
Because of Derek, I'm playing 12 more
minutes a game than I did last season.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.785
He is wearing me down!

12:15.902 --> 12:20.032
This isn't about the money
or wanting to live on some damn farm.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.251
It's about extending my career.

12:26.579 --> 12:31.426
- But you're okay now, right?
- Yeah, in my prime.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.555
For now.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.931
I know you don't trust easily.

12:46.891 --> 12:51.271
Is there any chance you're upset
about what Indiana could mean for us?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.566
I already told you why I'm mad.
I have to get to the floor.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.798
Awesome, girls!

14:47.595 --> 14:49.723
It's funny the second
I'm not calling the shots,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
Ahsha gets an opening
to showboat.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.686
I would call of it
more of a moment to shine.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.650
And I can't control
who the audience falls in love with.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.157
If I could,
my life would be a lot different.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.452
What a show. You guys were awesome.
You killed it!

15:06.614 --> 15:08.708
And listen,
I was not the only one who noticed.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.745
The Dream was sitting
in one of the boxes tonight.

15:12.995 --> 15:17.250
He'd like each of you to perform a solo,
so he can pick a girl to be in his video.

15:18.459 --> 15:22.589
- Hey, Jelena, you auditioning?
- Been there, done that.

15:23.756 --> 15:28.011
You were amazing tonight.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.055
Thanks. It felt good.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.650
Why haven't you submitted yourself
for the All-Star game?

15:34.809 --> 15:37.437
That's Jelena's thing.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.322
There's a time to be a team player
and a time to be a star.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.655
Out there tonight, you were a star.

15:45.236 --> 15:49.241
Listen, change your mind,
decide to throw your name in,

15:49.407 --> 15:51.956
just know
that you have my full support.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.503
Hello, dear.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.797
How would you like
some extracurricular work?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.509
What other kind of work is there?

16:03.671 --> 16:07.301
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock,
Devil's Playground.

16:16.601 --> 16:21.482
Hi. Hey, I was just looking for Ahsha.
Is she around?

16:21.647 --> 16:24.821
She's not, but she should be
back in, like, 15 minutes

16:24.942 --> 16:27.320
if you want to come in and wait.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.594
You were parked outside my house all
night and again, for the past two hours.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.382
Who are you and what do you want
with my daughter?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.805
I'm a friend of Ahsha's.
She told me to come by.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.559
Well, that's strange
because Ahsha doesn't live here.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.069
Did she ask you to sit
outside my house for days too?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.608
If you won't talk to me,
maybe you'll talk to the police.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.868
No, no, no.
Please, don't call the police.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.241
Who are you?

17:12.031 --> 17:16.537
- I'm dialling in three, two--
- Fine. Call them.

17:16.661 --> 17:20.290
Tell them I'm Mia Sertner.
I used to be a Devil Girl.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.630
- And that Oscar Kincade is after--
- Oscar?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.678
- I have to go.
- Mia, wait.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.561
My name is Sloane Hayes.
I used to be a Devil Girl.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.721
I know what Oscar is capable of.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.607
There's nothing you can tell me
that I won't believe.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.105
- I can't.
- You can.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.485
I'm just so tired of running.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.280
Then why don't we sit and talk?

19:29.460 --> 19:32.179
Cut, cut, cut.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.008
That was dope.

19:35.174 --> 19:39.429
- Thanks. Thank you. Big fan.
- No, really, you're amazing.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.983
Sorry,
does that mean I'm in the video?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.898
You are the video.

19:47.812 --> 19:52.659
Oscar would make the arrangements.
All I had to do was show up.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.995
I would open my locker
and there would be a name

19:56.153 --> 19:58.155
and hotel key in an envelope.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.908
And they were businessmen or...?

20:01.075 --> 20:04.670
Guys who had something to do
with the next game we were playing.

20:04.829 --> 20:09.676
You know, he'd send me to a ref.
They'd blow a couple calls.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.212
He'd send me to a player
on the other team

20:12.378 --> 20:15.257
and they'd be exhausted
during the game.

20:15.381 --> 20:19.887
One of their assistant coaches
and the starters would ride the bench.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.180
He was using you to get wins.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.229
Didn't always work.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.395
But even when we lost,
Oscar still seemed happy.

20:31.939 --> 20:36.490
He wasn't trying to win.
He was controlling the spread.

20:39.989 --> 20:44.836
You don't have to win to win money.
It's gambling.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.372
Jesus.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.508
I can't even imagine
how much money you can win

20:50.624 --> 20:53.218
gambling off an entire season

20:53.377 --> 20:56.802
and the number of people
who would have to be in on it.

20:58.007 --> 21:02.478
Everything was fine until it wasn't.

21:03.721 --> 21:07.316
One night, something went down.

21:07.475 --> 21:11.070
Oscar turned on me.
People started following me.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.606
You know, I thought
I found a way to end this,

21:13.773 --> 21:15.901
to maybe get him running scared but--

21:16.025 --> 21:18.369
What happened that night?

21:22.698 --> 21:26.123
Mia, what you're sitting on

21:26.285 --> 21:30.756
could put Oscar in prison
for a long time.

21:30.915 --> 21:35.045
- You need to go to the police.
- The police can't protect me.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.760
I mean, you know
how connected he is.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.050
Why should they listen to me anyway?

21:40.216 --> 21:43.015
I wouldn't listen to me,
the things that I've done.

21:43.177 --> 21:50.026
You can get lost in this world
and, when you're in the thick of it,

21:50.142 --> 21:52.440
you do things
you wouldn't otherwise do.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.822
But that does not make you
a bad person.

21:58.943 --> 22:03.073
I don't have proof. Okay, I'm trying
to get it, but I don't have it.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.869
So it's me against them
and there's a whole lot more of them.

22:07.034 --> 22:11.164
It's not just you, not any more.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.466
I can help you.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.385
First things first.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.680
You look like
you haven't slept in weeks.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.438
Why don't you take a shower,
get some sleep?

22:27.596 --> 22:31.772
You can stay in Ahsha's room.
You're safe here.

22:36.981 --> 22:41.077
Mate, it's six grand minimum.
Mate, I'm gonna have to call you back.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.737
I thought you might be coming by.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.990
What are you doing
dragging Pete into this?

22:45.155 --> 22:48.329
Pete Davenport has
a history of drinking, partying.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.085
I don't want that around my child.

22:50.244 --> 22:53.839
This isn't about your child.
This is about you acting like a child.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.217
When did you become this person?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
You were bad,
but you weren't this bad.

22:58.502 --> 23:02.382
Or did you just turn the other way 'cause
you loved the life that I came with,

23:02.548 --> 23:04.642
fancy parties, fancy clothes?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.768
I loved you.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.893
- You left me.
- You cheated.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.526
You knew the rules!
Players have girls in every city.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.437
Wives and girlfriends
go along with that.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.732
You're not a player.
You're an agent.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.153
We all sit at the same table.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.664
You used to sit there too.
Now you just bus and clear it.

23:30.993 --> 23:35.499
We're in a bad place now, but if you
could just remember who we were then,

23:35.623 --> 23:37.466
what we were to each other.

23:37.583 --> 23:41.429
It doesn't have to be this way.
Forget your rules.

23:41.545 --> 23:46.016
For once, we can make up new rule,
to be kind to each other.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.032
Hey, you missed it last night.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.661
We beat the state champs by ten.
We were raining threes.

24:06.904 --> 24:11.410
- So that's why you missed the game.
- I have games too.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.875
My schedule's on the fridge, Ahsha.
It's been there all season.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.881
That's great that you guys won.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.343
I have news too. I got the video.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.682
- What video?
- The Dream.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.810
He wants me to be the love interest
on his new video.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.682
Guess we can add him to the list.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.403
Why can't you just be happy for me?

24:41.605 --> 24:45.985
That's all I get to be lately,
happy for you.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.621
I don't get to live a life anymore.
It's all about you.

24:49.780 --> 24:54.035
You and your calendars.
You and you $100,000 dances.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.249
You and your crazy mansion parties.

24:56.412 --> 25:00.883
And guess who else
that was all about? Derek Roman.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.636
I supported you all through college
when you were the big star

25:04.795 --> 25:08.390
and I was literally the girlfriend
on the sideline cheering you on.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.051
It was all about you.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.061
But now that it's about me,
I have to feel guilty.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.149
How many of my games
have you been to this year?

25:17.266 --> 25:21.487
As many as I could! I turned down a lot
of Devil Girls stuff to come home to you.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.115
I'm sorry it's such a let-down for you
to come home to me.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.509
A lot of people
have been pissed at me lately.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.301
Deserters get that a lot, I guess.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.143
We said
we were gonna do this together.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.887
That's before you started
wearing me down.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.897
I stopped partying.
I don't do any of that stuff anymore.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.981
- I've changed.
- Same soup, just reheated.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.320
Derek, this is different.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.440
Deal isn't done yet.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.235
But it's gonna take more than
your promises to throw this in reverse.

26:11.195 --> 26:15.291
You got to take your shot
when you get it before it's too late.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.753
Seven, eight.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.429
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.607
Wow, quite a Showstopper.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.144
It's amazing what you can do
when given the chance.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.780
When I'm back,
it's the first thing I'm going to cut.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.361
Get ready to be grounded.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.742
This is me putting my name in
for the All-Star game.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.009
I heard some wild stories
about Hurricane Jelena

27:11.171 --> 27:12.593
storming around the arena.

27:12.756 --> 27:16.351
A few of the dancers came up here
to drink their pain away.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.228
Anything to do
with the trade rumour?

27:20.597 --> 27:25.603
You know, sometimes it's good
to share things with your...bartender.

27:27.688 --> 27:32.740
- Wine?
- Vod ka, rocks.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.088
He didn't even tell me.

27:53.255 --> 27:58.682
- What if he did? Would you be fine?
- No.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.642
Why not?

28:03.807 --> 28:07.812
It's okay. I'm not the one
that needs to hear it.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.902
Thanks for the drink.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.368
I just want to make this really clear,

28:22.534 --> 28:24.002
because from your reaction,
I don't think you got it.

28:24.161 --> 28:27.335
There's nothing going on between me
and Raquel. I just helped her get a lawyer

28:27.497 --> 28:29.499
for her custody case
between her and Jesse and that's--

28:29.625 --> 28:31.468
Pete, this really isn't a good time.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.934
Everything is fine. Don't sweat it.
I'll call you tomorrow.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.937
Oh, there's my girl.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.441
That's quite a dress.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.702
So, what can I do for you?

28:56.860 --> 29:00.160
Got a little poker game going on
in the VIP room

29:00.322 --> 29:02.541
with three other team owners.

29:02.699 --> 29:06.670
I need you to keep them happy,
distracted and drunk.

29:06.828 --> 29:10.628
Well, happy, distracted and drunk
is what I do best.

29:10.791 --> 29:16.389
Good. There's ten Gs in it
for you, plus tips.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.058
Looks like we got some owners
in the place tonight.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.935
Yeah, they told me twice.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.813
Net worth in that room alone
is in the hundreds of millions.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.357
They mentioned that too.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.525
I know you look at that room
and you see pigs

29:36.692 --> 29:39.992
that learned to walk upright,
smoke cigars and play cards.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.531
But tonight,
if you play your cards right,

29:42.698 --> 29:45.417
those pigs can also pay
for your kid's college tuition.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.957
What would I have to do?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.748
You keep those drinks flowing,
I'll keep the balls in the air.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.712
What do you say?

30:04.428 --> 30:06.681
I've had some time to think and--

30:06.847 --> 30:10.693
- I told you to stay away from me.
- That's the problem.

30:10.851 --> 30:14.025
I can't.
And I won't have any more regrets.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.616
I can't stop thinking about you
and I want to.

30:17.774 --> 30:21.824
I want to bash my head up against the
wall until you go away, but you're not.

30:21.945 --> 30:25.575
The way you dance, the way you laugh,
the way you tear my head off.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.085
- Derek, don't.
- I know. Listen, I know.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.463
I know you got a guy
and he's probably great.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.548
But I can be great too.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.969
The thing is, I don't know how.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.472
But you do.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.509
And I can help you be
who you really are.

30:47.220 --> 30:51.726
If I'm a mistake, I'll be
the best mistake you ever make.

30:53.393 --> 30:57.239
And if I'm not,
I will change your life.

31:21.004 --> 31:25.009
So I hear things are moving
with your new arena complex.

31:26.009 --> 31:29.388
We've received a flux of capital
over the past year.

31:29.554 --> 31:33.684
It looks like we're gonna be playing
in Hollywood in no time.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.353
Well, I look forward to it.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.695
I didn't realise
you guys played poker in Indiana.

31:41.858 --> 31:45.954
Well, can't play basketball
24 hours a day.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.715
Why don't I show you gentlemen
our fine assortment of cigars?

32:12.681 --> 32:18.484
You're after Terrence Wall.
You're throwing a lot of money at him.

32:18.645 --> 32:23.492
I'd hate to make a mess of the deal, so
why don't we settle this like gentlemen?

32:23.650 --> 32:26.494
- What do you say?
- Let's play cards.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.587
Terrence Wall.

32:48.175 --> 32:50.724
- I've done some soul searching.
- And?

32:51.970 --> 32:55.395
And I've figured it out.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.395
I'm not right with how we ended.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.940
It turns out I do have a heart
and it hurts.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.820
I never got closure.

33:09.779 --> 33:13.909
Now, I could drop
all this Pete nonsense.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.624
I could even drop
the whole custody thing...

33:17.954 --> 33:22.084
if you have sex with me
one last time.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.844
That's what this was about,
this whole time!

33:28.006 --> 33:29.553
You never wanted Miguel.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.344
You wanted me to keep playing
these games with me.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.897
- I'm offended.
- You're disgusting.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.650
You think this is gonna prove
you're some big man?

33:41.895 --> 33:46.366
You should know better than anyone
that I am a big man. Sleep on it.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.371
There was a call transferred
up here for you.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.333
It's a collect call
from Folsom State prison.

33:59.579 --> 34:03.004
- Should I hang it up?
<i>- I'll</i> take it.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.214
Okay.

34:18.431 --> 34:22.231
Terrence Wall comes to Indiana.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.409
That was funner
than a double overtime.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.911
Thank you for that, Oscar.

34:39.159 --> 34:43.791
I... I didn't realise
we were playing with wilds.

34:43.956 --> 34:48.588
Looks like this deal
isn't a slam dunk after all.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.630
That was a pun.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.974
I'm worried. Okay?

35:03.059 --> 35:05.403
I'm worried
about you going to Indiana.

35:07.188 --> 35:12.661
I like things the way they are,
here, with you.

35:14.404 --> 35:17.123
Thank you for trusting me with that.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.502
Now I can tell you
why you shouldn't worry.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.412
Come here.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.626
It doesn't matter what city
is on the front of my jersey.

35:26.791 --> 35:31.297
I'm with you and I will be with you
every second that I can.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.595
I've got planes, trains
and automobiles.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.136
I'll fly here. I'll fly you there.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.514
Nothing is gonna keep me away
from you.

35:57.197 --> 36:01.327
Agent. Yeah.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.789
What are you talking about?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.755
That's not... How?

36:13.129 --> 36:15.131
Yeah.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.056
What?

36:20.679 --> 36:24.149
The drug test I took for the trade,
I failed.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.028
Tested positive for oxymetholone.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.445
- What is that?
- Helps with recovery.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.572
I didn't take it.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.867
You believe me, don't you?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.731
I don't want to be
someone else's love interest.

37:06.391 --> 37:10.817
- So you're not doing the video?
- I'm scared.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.699
Me too.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.579
We've been fighting each other.
We need to start fighting for us.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.026
Mia?

38:35.188 --> 38:37.782
I thought you could use some towels
for tomorrow.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.794
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor...</i>

38:53.957 --> 38:55.425
Have you seen the latest
All-Star numbers?

38:55.542 --> 38:59.092
I don't know what Olivia promised you,
but if it was humiliation, she delivered.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.348
You're Pete Davenport's daughter.
If that were to leak out,

39:01.464 --> 39:03.717
everyone would want to see you
at that All-Star game.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.638
- Mia?
- I did not expect this from Coach D!

39:07.804 --> 39:09.772
It's natural to be suspicious.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.774
I don't know what I'd do
if I didn't think you were on my side.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.401
What happened in the elevator
during the blackout?

39:13.560 --> 39:16.404
The power went out. I wasn't
trying to get stuck with Derek.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.315
Did you kiss him?

39:18.481 --> 39:20.734
- Where's Ahsha?
- Pete?
