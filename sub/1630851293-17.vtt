>> John: HI THERE!

00:31.466 --> 00:32.300
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

00:32.366 --> 00:32.900
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

00:32.966 --> 00:33.800
BLANK VOID.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.333
THINK OF IT LIKE DISNEY WORLD --

00:35.400 --> 00:36.333
A BRIGHT WONDERLAND WHERE,

00:36.400 --> 00:36.966
FOR SOME REASON,

00:37.033 --> 00:37.900
PEOPLE GET EXCITED TO SEE

00:37.966 --> 00:39.800
A LARGE, PANTSLESS BIRD.

00:39.866 --> 00:41.333
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.666
RUDY GIULIANI'S LAW LICENSE WAS

00:42.733 --> 00:44.033
SUSPENDED, THE SUPREME COURT

00:44.100 --> 00:45.366
RELEASED A SERIES OF RULINGS,

00:45.433 --> 00:46.300
ONE OF WHICH INVOLVED

00:46.366 --> 00:47.733
JUSTICE BREYER HAVING TO EXPLAIN

00:47.800 --> 00:48.766
WHAT SNAPCHAT WAS,

00:48.833 --> 00:50.066
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS:

00:50.133 --> 00:51.166
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS TONIGHT

00:51.233 --> 00:52.800
BLOCKING A DEMOCRATIC VOTING

00:52.866 --> 00:54.466
BILL THAT WOULD HAVE OVERHAULED

00:54.533 --> 00:56.666
THE COUNTRY'S ELECTION SYSTEM.

00:56.733 --> 00:57.666
REPUBLICANS TONIGHT SLAMMING

00:57.733 --> 00:59.100
THE BILL AS A PARTISAN POWER

00:59.166 --> 01:01.033
GRAB BY DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD

01:01.100 --> 01:02.633
FEDERALIZE ELECTIONS, INCLUDING

01:02.700 --> 01:05.233
PREVENTING STATES FROM REQUIRING

01:05.300 --> 01:06.333
VOTER I.D.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.966
>> S1 WOULD TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS

01:09.033 --> 01:10.566
OF PEOPLE IN EACH OF THE

01:10.633 --> 01:13.800
50 STATES TO DETERMINE WHICH

01:13.866 --> 01:16.400
ELECTION RULES WORK BEST FOR

01:16.466 --> 01:18.266
THEIR CITIZENS.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.000
>> John: WELL....

01:19.066 --> 01:21.000
YEAH, IT WOULD.

01:21.066 --> 01:22.900
BECAUSE HISTORY SHOWS CERTAIN

01:22.966 --> 01:24.766
PEOPLE IN CERTAIN STATES HAVE

01:24.833 --> 01:26.166
DETERMINED WHICH ELECTION RULES

01:26.233 --> 01:31.233
WORK BEST FOR CERTAIN CITIZENS.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.300
PROBLEM,

01:34.366 --> 01:35.000
THAT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING

01:35.066 --> 01:36.000
PROBLEM, COLLINS.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.133
YOUR PARTY MIGHT KNOW THAT IF IT

01:37.200 --> 01:38.100
WASN'T SO BUSY FIGHTING TO COVER

01:38.166 --> 01:38.800
UP THAT HISTORY.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.000
ALTHOUGH I DO GET IT, IF I HAD

01:40.066 --> 01:41.233
THE POWER TO COVER UP PAST

01:41.300 --> 01:41.933
MISTAKES, I'D PROBABLY ERASE

01:42.000 --> 01:42.800
THE WHOLE DRUMPF THING FROM

01:42.866 --> 01:44.566
THE INTERNET, ALONG WITH ABOUT

01:44.633 --> 01:45.700
TWO DECADES OF HAIRCUTS.

01:45.766 --> 01:46.533
BUT, LIKE MY BARBER/THERAPIST

01:46.600 --> 01:47.733
TELLS ME, "WE CAN'T CHANGE

01:47.800 --> 01:49.266
HISTORY, WE CAN ONLY PREVENT IT

01:49.333 --> 01:49.966
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN."

01:50.033 --> 01:51.433
AND THE DEFEAT OF THIS BILL

01:51.500 --> 01:52.633
COMES AS REPUBLICANS IN STATE

01:52.700 --> 01:53.833
LEGISLATURES HAVE PUSHED NEARLY

01:53.900 --> 01:56.100
400 NEW BILLS AND LAWS

01:56.166 --> 01:58.166
RESTRICTING VOTING RIGHTS,

01:58.233 --> 02:00.233
WHICH, IN MANY CASES, ARE FUELED

02:00.300 --> 02:01.833
BY LIES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD IN

02:01.900 --> 02:04.800
THE LAST ELECTION, DESPITE THOSE

02:04.866 --> 02:05.933
LIES CONTINUALLY FALLING APART.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.200
JUST THIS WEEK, A MICHIGAN

02:08.266 --> 02:09.866
REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE

02:09.933 --> 02:10.766
INVESTIGATION PUBLISHED A REPORT

02:10.833 --> 02:11.766
FINDING "NO EVIDENCE OF

02:11.833 --> 02:12.700
WIDESPREAD OR SYSTEMATIC FRAUD

02:12.766 --> 02:13.566
IN THE STATE'S HANDLING OF

02:13.633 --> 02:15.233
THE ELECTION."

02:15.300 --> 02:16.400
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER,

02:16.466 --> 02:18.733
EVEN WILDER CLAIM THAT'S

02:18.800 --> 02:20.233
UNRAVELING IN TRULY SPECTACULAR

02:20.300 --> 02:21.033
FASHION.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.700
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED

02:22.766 --> 02:23.666
"ITALYGATE," WHICH ISN'T

02:23.733 --> 02:25.000
ACTUALLY REFERRING TO THE MANY

02:25.066 --> 02:26.666
TIMES THE CUOMO BROTHERS DID

02:26.733 --> 02:28.366
"NEWS INCEST," BUT IT IS A SPICY

02:28.433 --> 02:30.200
MEAT-A-BALL OF A CONSPIRACY.

02:30.266 --> 02:31.900
AND THERE WERE SOME DEVELOPMENTS

02:31.966 --> 02:33.833
EARLIER THIS MONTH, WHEN EMAILS

02:33.900 --> 02:35.233
SURFACED BETWEEN MARK MEADOWS,

02:35.300 --> 02:36.833
TRUMP'S CHIEF OF STAFF, AND

02:36.900 --> 02:38.066
THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:38.133 --> 02:39.066
THAT WERE SENT LAST DECEMBER.

02:39.133 --> 02:40.200
>> AMONG MEADOWS' REQUESTS:

02:40.266 --> 02:41.933
THAT ROSEN LOOK INTO ITALYGATE,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT PEOPLE

02:44.066 --> 02:45.566
IN ITALY USED MILITARY

02:45.633 --> 02:47.033
TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITES TO

02:47.100 --> 02:48.566
SWITCH TRUMP VOTES TO BIDEN

02:48.633 --> 02:51.833
VOTES IN U.S. VOTING MACHINES.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.700
>> John: RIGHT.

02:52.766 --> 02:53.600
THE THEORY IS, MILITARY

02:53.666 --> 02:54.533
SATELLITES APPARENTLY STOLE

02:54.600 --> 02:55.766
THE ELECTION.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.533
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STUPID,

02:58.600 --> 02:59.400
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

02:59.466 --> 03:00.733
AND IT GOT EARLY TRACTION THANKS

03:00.800 --> 03:02.133
TO THIS JOURNALIST, WHO'S BEEN

03:02.200 --> 03:02.800
CALLED "THE SEAN HANNITY OF

03:02.866 --> 03:03.866
ITALY."

03:03.933 --> 03:04.633
WHICH ALREADY MIGHT BE THE

03:04.700 --> 03:05.666
MEANEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD

03:05.733 --> 03:08.200
IN MY LIFE.

03:08.266 --> 03:09.400
BUT THE KEY QUESTION STILL IS,

03:09.466 --> 03:09.966
HOW DID THAT THEORY GET TO

03:10.033 --> 03:11.600
THE WHITE HOUSE?

03:11.666 --> 03:12.766
WELL, LAST WEEKEND,

03:12.833 --> 03:14.133
"THE WASHINGTON POST" FILLED IN

03:14.200 --> 03:15.666
A KEY CONNECTION, AND I'M GOING

03:15.733 --> 03:17.066
TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT NOT BECAUSE

03:17.133 --> 03:18.100
IT'S IMPORTANT, BUT BECAUSE IT

03:18.166 --> 03:19.133
IS INCREDIBLE.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.700
AND IT CONCERNS THIS WOMAN,

03:20.766 --> 03:22.633
MICHELE ROOSEVELT EDWARDS,

03:22.700 --> 03:23.833
A BUSINESSWOMAN AND SOLE

03:23.900 --> 03:24.933
SURVIVING CONSUMER OF

03:25.000 --> 03:26.500
THE "BUMP IT."

03:26.566 --> 03:27.966
THE EMAIL MEADOWS SENT

03:28.033 --> 03:29.500
CONCERNING ITALYGATE INCLUDED

03:29.566 --> 03:31.066
THIS LETTER, WHICH OUTLINED

03:31.133 --> 03:32.600
THE CONSPIRACY, AND WAS PRINTED

03:32.666 --> 03:34.033
ON THE LETTERHEAD OF A COMPANY

03:34.100 --> 03:35.033
EDWARDS RUNS.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.733
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE --

03:36.800 --> 03:38.333
BECAUSE ANOTHER OF HER FIRMS WAS

03:38.400 --> 03:39.766
PUSHING THE ITALYGATE CLAIMS

03:39.833 --> 03:41.300
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

03:41.366 --> 03:42.666
AND WHILE EDWARDS CLAIMS SHE WAS

03:42.733 --> 03:44.133
UNAWARE OF THAT LETTER, THE MORE

03:44.200 --> 03:45.566
YOU LEARN ABOUT HER, THE HARDER

03:45.633 --> 03:46.600
IT IS TO TAKE ANYTHING SHE SAYS

03:46.666 --> 03:48.500
AT FACE VALUE.

03:48.566 --> 03:49.833
BECAUSE THIS WOMAN HAS LIVED

03:49.900 --> 03:52.133
MANY AMAZING LIVES.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.200
AFTER UNSUCCESSFULLY RUNNING

03:54.266 --> 03:55.400
FOR CONGRESS IN THE '80s, SHE

03:55.466 --> 03:57.066
HAD A STINT DESIGNING CHILDREN'S

03:57.133 --> 03:58.066
CLOTHING, SAYING SHE WAS

03:58.133 --> 03:59.400
"KNOWN AS THE COCO CHANEL IN

03:59.466 --> 04:00.800
THE CHILDREN'S INDUSTRY,"

04:00.866 --> 04:03.033
A CLAIM SUPPORTED BY NO ONE.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.900
SHE LATER REINVENTED HERSELF

04:04.966 --> 04:06.900
AS A PEACE BROKER FOR

04:06.966 --> 04:09.433
THE SOMALI PEOPLE, TELLING

04:09.500 --> 04:11.066
INTERVIEWERS, "THEY CALL ME

04:11.133 --> 04:11.800
THE MOTHER OF SOMALIA, I HAVE

04:11.866 --> 04:13.566
NINE MILLION CHILDREN."

04:13.633 --> 04:14.633
AND WHO, EXACTLY, ARE "THEY"

04:14.700 --> 04:16.233
THERE?

04:16.300 --> 04:18.466
BECAUSE UNLESS THE SOMALI PEOPLE

04:18.533 --> 04:19.900
UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO REFER TO

04:19.966 --> 04:21.100
WHAT YOU'D GET IF

04:21.166 --> 04:22.866
CALLISTA GINGRICH STUCK A FORK

04:22.933 --> 04:24.233
INTO AN OUTLET AS

04:24.300 --> 04:25.300
"THEIR NATIONAL MOMMY,"

04:25.366 --> 04:26.566
I'M REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO STOP

04:26.633 --> 04:28.000
YOU RIGHT THERE.

04:28.066 --> 04:29.333
AND AS EDWARDS EAGERLY INSERTED

04:29.400 --> 04:31.933
HERSELF INTO SOMALI AFFAIRS,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.200
A NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WHO

04:33.266 --> 04:34.166
ONCE WORKED WITH HER WAS QUOTED

04:34.233 --> 04:34.300
NO

04:34.366 --> 04:35.700
AS SAYING, "THE PROBLEM WITH

04:35.766 --> 04:36.500
MICHELE IS SEPARATING FACT FROM

04:36.566 --> 04:37.400
FICTION.

04:37.466 --> 04:38.933
WHAT IS REAL, AND WHAT IS

04:39.000 --> 04:40.433
MADE UP?"

04:40.500 --> 04:41.533
TO WHICH I'D SAY, "FOR A START,

04:41.600 --> 04:42.700
MAYBE THE NINE MILLION CHILDREN

04:42.766 --> 04:44.266
THING."

04:44.333 --> 04:46.600
BUT WAIT, IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.466
BECAUSE EARLIER THIS YEAR,

04:48.533 --> 04:49.933
EDWARDS WAS FEATURED ON THIS

04:50.000 --> 04:51.533
TV SHOW IN ICELAND, AFTER TAKING

04:51.600 --> 04:52.866
OVER AN AIRLINE THERE -- IT'S

04:52.933 --> 04:53.833
CALLED "WOW" AIR -- IT'S

04:53.900 --> 04:55.066
TERRIBLE; THAT'S NOT THE POINT;

04:55.133 --> 04:55.200
NO

04:55.266 --> 04:55.833
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.566
AND DURING THE INTERVIEW,

04:57.633 --> 04:59.000
SHE TOOK THE REPORTER ON A TOUR

04:59.066 --> 05:01.966
OF HER VAST, $30 MILLION

05:02.033 --> 05:02.333
VIRGINIA ESTATE.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.833
ALTHOUGH IT WAS CLEAR STRAIGHT

05:03.900 --> 05:05.833
AWAY SOMETHING WAS OFF.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.533
>> IT'S NEARLY 1,500 ACRES.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.800
IT TAKES 11 PEOPLE FULL-TIME

05:08.866 --> 05:10.133
TO MANAGE THE OUTSIDE OF THE

05:10.200 --> 05:11.866
PROPERTY ON A FULL-TIME BASIS.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.866
38,000 FEET, 22 BEDROOMS,

05:13.933 --> 05:16.433
THREE KITCHENS.

05:16.500 --> 05:16.566
NO

05:16.633 --> 05:17.200
>> HOW MANY OF THEM DO YOU USE?

05:17.266 --> 05:18.866
>> ALL THREE.

05:18.933 --> 05:23.033
THAT'S WHY THE CHEF'S HERE.

05:23.100 --> 05:23.633
>> THE KITCHENS WERE ACTUALLY

05:23.700 --> 05:25.200
PRETTY EMPTY, HARDLY ANY SIGNS

05:25.266 --> 05:26.100
OF ACTIVITY.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.066
AND THE MASTER CHEF WAS NOT

05:27.133 --> 05:28.366
ON HAND EITHER TO BREW COFFEE:

05:28.433 --> 05:29.500
THAT CAME IN A BOX FROM A

05:29.566 --> 05:31.500
DOUGHNUT CHAIN.

05:31.566 --> 05:33.533
>> John: OKAY, SO JUST TO MAKE

05:33.600 --> 05:35.000
SURE I HAVE THIS STRAIGHT -- SHE

05:35.066 --> 05:37.800
EMPLOYS 11 PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE

05:37.866 --> 05:39.100
OF HER 1500 ACRE ESTATE THAT

05:39.166 --> 05:40.933
CONTAINS THREE KITCHENS, NO

05:41.000 --> 05:41.766
PERSONAL EFFECTS, AND ONE MAN

05:41.833 --> 05:43.433
WHOSE JOB SEEMS TO BE TO POUR

05:43.500 --> 05:44.566
TAKEOUT DUNKIN' INTO A STYROFOAM

05:44.633 --> 05:44.700
NO

05:44.766 --> 05:46.666
CUP WHILE DRESSED LIKE THE FIRST

05:46.733 --> 05:47.300
RESULT YOU GET WHEN YOU GOOGLE

05:47.366 --> 05:49.633
"SILLY CARTOON CHEF."

05:49.700 --> 05:50.633
AND IF IT SEEMED LIKE

05:50.700 --> 05:57.266
THE REPORTER IS HINTING AT

05:57.333 --> 05:58.133
SOMETHING THERE, IT'S BECAUSE

05:58.200 --> 05:59.266
HE VERY MUCH WAS.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.666
>> BEFORE WE WRAP UP -- BECAUSE

06:00.733 --> 06:01.600
WE STARTED WITH A TOUR OF YOUR

06:01.666 --> 06:03.033
HOME, WHEN I WAS JUST LOOKING OF

06:03.100 --> 06:04.933
WHERE I SHOULD GO ON -- IN A

06:05.000 --> 06:06.400
SEARCH ENGINE, THE STUFF THAT

06:06.466 --> 06:07.533
CAME UP WAS ALL REAL ESTATE

06:07.600 --> 06:08.733
LISTINGS, AND THAT THIS PLACE

06:08.800 --> 06:09.266
WAS FOR SALE.

06:09.333 --> 06:09.933
>> MMM-HM.

06:10.000 --> 06:10.666
>> IS IT FOR SALE?

06:10.733 --> 06:11.033
>> NO.

06:11.100 --> 06:11.833
IT'S NOT NOW.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.933
>> AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN

06:13.000 --> 06:13.133
HERE?

06:13.200 --> 06:13.966
>> THIS IS A RECENT ACQUISITION

06:14.033 --> 06:15.033
FOR US.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.266
>> IT'S VERY SORT OF --

06:16.333 --> 06:17.166
IT'S VERY FORMAL.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.200
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WALKING INTO

06:19.266 --> 06:20.533
A -- A RENTED PROPERTY.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.266
>> NO.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.266
IT'S NOT RENTED PROPERTY,

06:22.333 --> 06:23.666
I CAN ASSURE YOU.

06:23.733 --> 06:24.666
>> SO THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE,

06:24.733 --> 06:25.700
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

06:25.766 --> 06:26.200
>> YES, THIS IS --

06:26.266 --> 06:26.900
>> THIS IS YOUR PROPERTY.

06:26.966 --> 06:30.933
>> YES.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.366
>> John: NO, IT ISN'T.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.533
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT ISN'T!

06:34.600 --> 06:35.866
IN FACT, THE ACTUAL OWNER OF

06:35.933 --> 06:37.300
THAT PROPERTY WAS SHOWN THAT

06:37.366 --> 06:37.900
VIDEO AND SAID, "SHE'S IN MY

06:42.966 --> 06:44.066

12:46.133 --> 12:47.266
AND HCSMs ARE DEFINITELY AN

12:47.333 --> 12:48.966
ALTERNATIVE.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.833
BUT AS YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED

12:50.900 --> 12:53.966
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT

12:54.033 --> 12:54.600
THEM ON THIS SHOW, AND NOT

12:54.666 --> 12:55.833
"WHAT IF JOHN OLIVER WAS SOMEHOW

12:55.900 --> 12:56.433
LESS ANGRY, LESS ENGLISH, AND

12:56.500 --> 12:57.533
HAD JACK RYAN MONEY?"

12:57.600 --> 12:58.933
THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIGNIFICANT

12:59.000 --> 13:00.533
DRAWBACKS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON

13:00.600 --> 13:02.000
THE COMPANY IN QUESTION,

13:02.066 --> 13:02.866
CAN RANGE FROM THE DISQUIETING

13:02.933 --> 13:05.233
TO THE DISQUALIFYING.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.200
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

13:06.266 --> 13:10.033
HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.133
WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY DO, AND

13:11.200 --> 13:13.466
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT THEY

13:13.533 --> 13:14.700
DON'T DO, AND THE FIRST THING TO

13:14.766 --> 13:15.633
KNOW IS, HCSMs HAVE ACTUALLY

13:15.700 --> 13:16.600
EXISTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR

13:16.666 --> 13:18.533
DECADES, TRADITIONALLY SERVING

13:18.600 --> 13:20.000
SMALL, INSULAR COMMUNITIES LIKE

13:20.066 --> 13:22.500
MENNONITES AND THE AMISH.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.233
HOWEVER, THE 2010 AFFORDABLE

13:24.300 --> 13:25.733
CARE ACT INCLUDED A LOOPHOLE

13:25.800 --> 13:26.966
THAT EXEMPTED UNINSURED PEOPLE

13:27.033 --> 13:29.300
FROM PAYING THE TAX PENALTY IF

13:29.366 --> 13:31.766
THEY WERE A MEMBER OF AN HCSM.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.366
AND THAT WAS CLEARLY IMMEDIATELY

13:34.433 --> 13:36.466
APPEALING TO ANYONE WHO WANTED

13:36.533 --> 13:38.100
TO OPT O OF OBAMACARE.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.366
IN FACT, SOME HCSMs,

13:40.433 --> 13:40.900
LIKE LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE,

13:40.966 --> 13:41.566
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MINISTRIES,

13:41.633 --> 13:42.666
HAVE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED

13:42.733 --> 13:45.366
A CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.466
LIBERTY HAS RUN ADS ON THE

13:46.533 --> 13:48.100
BLAZE, AND ALSO SPONSORED CPAC

13:48.166 --> 13:49.700
-- IN FACT, REMEMBER THAT FAMOUS

13:49.766 --> 13:51.733
MOMENT WHEN TRUMP MOLESTED

13:51.800 --> 13:52.000
THE FLAG?

13:52.066 --> 13:53.033
THE LIBERTY LOGO WAS AN

13:53.100 --> 13:55.733
EYEWITNESS.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.166
AND LIBERTY EVEN MADE ITS SALES

13:57.233 --> 13:58.166
PITCH DIRECTLY TO THE CPAC

13:58.233 --> 13:58.933
AUDIENCE DURING PANELS LIKE

13:59.000 --> 14:00.233
THIS ONE.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.566
>> IF YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO

14:02.633 --> 14:03.966
TAKE CARE OF YOU AND YOU THINK

14:04.033 --> 14:04.833
THEY DO A GREAT JOB DOING IT,

14:04.900 --> 14:06.366
HEALTH SHARING IS NOT FOR YOU.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.866
IF YOU WANNA STICK IT TO 'EM,

14:07.933 --> 14:08.666
SIGN UP FOR LIBERTY

14:08.733 --> 14:16.700
HEALTHSHARE.

14:16.766 --> 14:16.966
[LAUGHTER]

14:17.033 --> 14:17.866
[APPLAUSE]

14:17.933 --> 14:18.966
>> John: ON A LIST OF THE WORST

14:19.033 --> 14:21.000
SOUNDS KNOWN TO MAN,

14:21.066 --> 14:21.966
"SELF-SATISFIED CPAC LAUGHTER"

14:22.033 --> 14:23.266
HAS TO BE RIGHT NEAR THE TOP,

14:23.333 --> 14:24.666
BEAT ONLY BY "WEEPING KITTEN"

14:24.733 --> 14:26.233
AND "MOTHER'S ORGASM."

14:26.300 --> 14:27.233
NOW, THAT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

14:27.300 --> 14:28.933
LOOPHOLE DID TRY TO PUT SOME

14:29.000 --> 14:30.133
LIMITS IN PLACE, TO KEEP THINGS

14:30.200 --> 14:31.700
FROM GETTING OUT OF HAND.

14:31.766 --> 14:33.033
IT STATED THAT YOUR MINISTRY --

14:33.100 --> 14:34.100
OR, CRUCIALLY, A PREDECESSOR OF

14:34.166 --> 14:35.700
IT, HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN

14:35.766 --> 14:38.300
CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE SINCE 1999.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.766
BUT THAT PREDECESSOR DETAIL

14:39.833 --> 14:42.000
LEFT ROOM FOR EXPLOITATION.

14:42.066 --> 14:43.466
BECAUSE NEW MINISTRIES SIMPLY

14:43.533 --> 14:45.633
STARTED AFFILIATING THEMSELVES

14:45.700 --> 14:46.100
WITH PREVIOUSLY-EXISTING

14:46.166 --> 14:47.166
CHURCHES.

14:47.233 --> 14:47.933
TAKE ONE CALLED

14:48.000 --> 14:50.400
TRINITY HEALTHSHARE.

14:50.466 --> 14:51.733
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 2018, WHICH IS

14:51.800 --> 14:54.266
-- AND THIS IS TRUE -- AFTER

14:54.333 --> 14:56.266
1999, BUT IT ARGUED THAT IT

14:56.333 --> 14:57.633
STILL QUALIFIED, BECAUSE IT

14:57.700 --> 14:58.966
"DERIVED ITS EXISTENCE FROM THE

14:59.033 --> 15:00.466
BAPTIST CHURCH, WHICH HAS BEEN

15:00.533 --> 15:01.866
IN EXISTENCE AND CONTINUALLY

15:01.933 --> 15:03.500
SHARING SINCE THE 1600s."

15:03.566 --> 15:06.333
WHICH IS OBVIOUS BULLSHIT.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.566
IT'S LIKE ME CLAIMING THIS SHOW

15:07.633 --> 15:09.100
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 13 BILLION

15:09.166 --> 15:10.633
YEARS BECAUSE THE BIG BANG WAS

15:10.700 --> 15:11.933
ALSO A BRIGHT EXPANSE CONTAINING

15:12.000 --> 15:15.600
EXTREMELY DENSE MATERIAL.

15:15.666 --> 15:16.700
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW ANYTHING

15:16.766 --> 15:17.233
WORKS.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.833
SO A LOOPHOLE THAT WAS INTENDED

15:18.900 --> 15:20.566
TO BE SMALL GOT PRETTY BIG --

15:20.633 --> 15:22.333
AND EVEN BIGGER ONCE OBAMACARE'S

15:22.400 --> 15:23.633
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE STOPPED BEING

15:23.700 --> 15:25.866
ENFORCED DURING THE TRUMP YEARS.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.100
AND THE RESULT OF ALL THIS WAS

15:27.166 --> 15:29.400
THAT THE POPULARITY OF THESE

15:29.466 --> 15:30.800
MINISTRIES EXPLODED, FROM AN

15:30.866 --> 15:32.600
ESTIMATED 200,000 MEMBERS

15:32.666 --> 15:33.533
A DECADE AGO, TO MORE THAN

15:33.600 --> 15:35.366
A MILLION TODAY.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.433
AND WHILE HCSMs WILL INSIST THEY

15:37.500 --> 15:39.966
MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT

15:40.033 --> 15:41.933
THEY'RE NOT HEALTH INSURANCE,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.433
MANY DO SEEM TO GO OUT OF THEIR

15:43.500 --> 15:45.166
WAY TO MAKE THEMSELVES APPEAR

15:45.233 --> 15:47.200
AS INSURANCE-LIKE AS POSSIBLE.

15:47.266 --> 15:49.166
FOR A START, THEY'RE SOMETIMES

15:49.233 --> 15:50.133
SOLD THROUGH INSURANCE BROKERS

15:50.200 --> 15:51.833
-- ALONGSIDE ACTUAL INSURANCE

15:51.900 --> 15:54.266
PLANS -- AND WHILE THE OBAMACARE

15:54.333 --> 15:55.933
MARKETPLACE OFFERS PLANS IN

15:56.000 --> 15:57.966
FOUR "METAL" CATEGORIES:

15:58.033 --> 15:59.100
BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, AND

15:59.166 --> 16:00.266
PLATINUM.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.600
A COMPANY CALLED ALTRUA OFFERED

16:01.666 --> 16:02.866
PLANS IN GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE,

16:02.933 --> 16:04.800
AND COPPER, REBRANDING THEM LAST

16:04.866 --> 16:06.366
YEAR TO DIAMOND, EMERALD,

16:06.433 --> 16:07.866
SAPPHIRE, AND RUBY.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.966
ALTHOUGH IT'S STILL PRETTY CLEAR

16:10.033 --> 16:10.966
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THERE

16:11.033 --> 16:12.300
-- VERY MUCH BLUR THE LINE,

16:12.366 --> 16:15.000
WHILE ALSO THROWING SOME UNFAIR

16:15.066 --> 16:16.600
SHADE AT RUBY, THE OBJECTIVE

16:16.666 --> 16:18.866
GOAT OF THE CARDINAL GEMS.

16:18.933 --> 16:21.633
SHE'S RED, KNOWN FOR HER FLAWS,

16:21.700 --> 16:22.200
AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST

16:22.266 --> 16:22.866
ICONIC SLIPPERS IN THE HISTORY

16:22.933 --> 16:25.366
OF CINEMA.

16:25.433 --> 16:25.900
EAT YOUR FUCKING HEARTS OUT,

16:25.966 --> 16:27.433
SAPPHIRE AND EMERALD, BECAUSE

16:27.500 --> 16:29.433
YOU COULD LITERALLY NEVER.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.566
BUT WHILE THESE HCSMs MAY HAVE

16:30.633 --> 16:32.600
THE OPTICS OF INSURANCE, THERE

16:32.666 --> 16:34.133
ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

16:34.200 --> 16:35.666
DIFFERENCES.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.566
FOR A START, THEY DON'T HAVE TO

16:37.633 --> 16:38.900
ABIDE BY LAWS GOVERNING

16:38.966 --> 16:40.666
INSURANCE PRODUCTS, MEANING

16:40.733 --> 16:41.933
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING THEM

16:42.033 --> 16:43.300
FROM PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON

16:43.366 --> 16:44.466
COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING

16:44.533 --> 16:45.400
CONDITIONS.

16:45.466 --> 16:47.266
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.000
AND NOT ONLY THAT -- MANY WON'T

16:49.066 --> 16:50.900
COVER SERVICES CONSIDERED

16:50.966 --> 16:52.533
"ESSENTIAL" UNDER THE ACA,

16:52.600 --> 16:53.866
LIKE TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE

16:53.933 --> 16:55.733
ABUSE, OR MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.600
IN FACT, ALTRUA EXCLUDES THOSE,

16:57.666 --> 16:59.166
AND ALSO TREATMENT FOR OBESITY

16:59.233 --> 17:01.100
OR AUTISM.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.266
AND SAMARITAN'S "CLASSIC" PLAN

17:02.333 --> 17:04.200
HAS A LIST OF NON-QUALIFIED

17:04.266 --> 17:05.433
ITEMS INCLUDING "ROUTINE,

17:05.500 --> 17:06.833
MAINTENANCE, STABILIZED,

17:06.900 --> 17:09.300
PREVENTIVE, AND WELLNESS CARE"

17:09.366 --> 17:12.533
-- THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM

17:12.600 --> 17:13.333
REGULAR CHECKUPS TO

17:13.400 --> 17:17.833
VACCINATIONS.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.966
AND EVEN FOR ELIGIBLE EXPENSES,

17:19.033 --> 17:19.566
THE MOST THAT CAN BE

17:19.633 --> 17:20.733
SHARED FOR A GIVEN NEED IS

17:20.800 --> 17:21.500
$250,000.

17:21.566 --> 17:22.500
WHICH EXPLAINS THEIR FULL NAME,

17:22.566 --> 17:23.366
"SAMARITAN, NOT THE GOOD ONE,

17:23.433 --> 17:24.600
THOUGH -- JUST A RANDOM

17:24.666 --> 17:25.700
SAMARITAN WHO MIGHT WELL LEAVE

17:25.766 --> 17:26.566
YOU TO DIE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

17:26.633 --> 17:27.533
ABANDONED ROAD."

17:27.600 --> 17:29.000
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO

17:29.066 --> 17:29.866
ONE OF THE BIGGEST EXCUSES HCSMs

17:29.933 --> 17:31.100
CAN USE TO DENY COVERAGE, AND

17:31.166 --> 17:33.466
THAT'S MORALITY.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.233
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU CAN BE

17:35.300 --> 17:36.800
DENIED COVERAGE FOR BASICALLY

17:36.866 --> 17:38.066
ANYTHING.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.900
>> THIS IS A PROGRAM OF THE

17:40.966 --> 17:42.200
CHRISTIAN CARE MINISTRY AND

17:42.266 --> 17:43.533
PEOPLE WHO SMOKE OR SAME-SEX

17:43.600 --> 17:45.366
COUPLES NEED NOT APPLY.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.200
THE PROGRAM ALSO WON'T PAY FOR

17:47.266 --> 17:48.700
ILLNESSES RELATED TO ALCOHOL,

17:48.766 --> 17:50.566
ABORTION, OR OTHER

17:50.633 --> 17:52.366
LIFESTYLE-RELATED CHOICES.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.566
>> I NEED TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT

17:53.633 --> 17:55.866
GONNA BE PAYING FOR SOMEONE ELSE

17:55.933 --> 17:57.333
WHO'S DECIDED TO SIT ON THE

17:57.400 --> 17:58.366
COUCH AND EAT BONBONS ALL DAY.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.933
>> John: WOW, THAT IS HARSH.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.233
BUT THAT JUDGMENTAL TONE IS VERY

18:02.300 --> 18:04.533
MUCH IN LINE WITH HOW THESE

18:04.600 --> 18:05.466
MINISTRIES OPERATE.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.600
DO PEOPLE REALLY DESERVE

18:06.666 --> 18:07.800
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IF THEY

18:07.866 --> 18:09.433
EAT JUNK FOOD OR DON'T EXERCISE

18:09.500 --> 18:10.800
OR ARE GAY?

18:10.866 --> 18:11.866
JUST FIX IT!

18:11.933 --> 18:13.600
EAT A CARROT, GO FOR A RUN,

18:13.666 --> 18:14.933
RUB YOUR PENIS OR VAGINA ON

18:15.000 --> 18:16.233
SOMEBODY ELSE'S VAGINA OR PENIS,

18:16.300 --> 18:17.766
RESPECTIVELY.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.433
IT'S REALLY NOT DIFFICULT!

18:19.500 --> 18:21.066
AND THIS IS A PATTERN ACROSS

18:21.133 --> 18:21.866
HCSMs.

18:21.933 --> 18:23.133
LIBERTY'S MATERIALS SAY THAT

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
AN APPLICANT MUST COMPLY WITH

18:24.266 --> 18:26.166
A CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE.

18:26.233 --> 18:27.300
AND AMONG THE EXCLUSIONS ON

18:27.366 --> 18:29.200
SAMARITAN'S "CLASSIC" PROGRAM,

18:29.266 --> 18:30.233
YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY MIGHT PAY

18:30.300 --> 18:32.666
FOR TREATMENT FOR AN STD,

18:32.733 --> 18:34.833
BUT NOT IF IT WAS CONTRACTED BY

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE, AND

18:36.366 --> 18:37.966
THAT THE MEMBER HAS TO EXPLAIN

18:38.033 --> 18:39.366
HOW THE DISEASE WAS CONTRACTED.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.233
PRESUMABLY, THE HOTTER THE

18:41.300 --> 18:45.433
STORY, THE MORE MONEY YOU GET

18:45.500 --> 18:46.400
FOR OINTMENTS.

18:46.466 --> 18:47.466
VANILLA MISSIONARY SHIT ISN'T

18:47.533 --> 18:48.700
GOING TO GET COVERED, BUD.

18:48.766 --> 18:49.833
YOU BETTER HAVE GOTTEN GONORRHEA

18:49.900 --> 18:50.900
FROM AN EARLOBE IF YOU WANT

18:50.966 --> 18:51.900
SAMARITAN'S ATTENTION.

18:51.966 --> 18:53.100
BUT SWEEPING MORAL JUDGMENT

18:53.166 --> 18:53.900
ISN'T THE ONLY LEEWAY THESE

18:53.966 --> 18:55.733
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.133
BECAUSE THEY'RE VOLUNTARY

18:57.200 --> 18:58.800
ASSOCIATIONS, YOU HAVE NO

18:58.866 --> 18:59.733
GUARANTEE THAT YOUR BILLS

18:59.800 --> 19:00.966
WILL GET PAID.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.366
ALTHOUGH, TO HEAR A FOUNDER OF

19:02.433 --> 19:05.733
LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE TELL IT,

19:05.800 --> 19:07.900
YOU'VE REALLY GOT NOTHING TO

19:07.966 --> 19:09.033
WORRY ABOUT THERE.

19:09.100 --> 19:09.800
JUST LISTEN TO HIM REASSURE

19:09.866 --> 19:10.966
PEOPLE IN A VIDEO ON THEIR

19:11.033 --> 19:11.566
WEBSITE TITLED, "WILL MY BILLS

19:11.633 --> 19:12.633
BE PAID?"

19:12.700 --> 19:13.800
>> WE'VE HAD A SUCCESSFUL

19:13.866 --> 19:16.166
HISTORY OF SHARING MEDICAL BILLS

19:16.233 --> 19:17.533
100%, FOR EVERY ELIGIBLE NEED

19:17.600 --> 19:19.033
EVER SUBMITTED.

19:19.100 --> 19:21.700
SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND UPON

19:21.766 --> 19:23.066
A WRITTEN CONTRACT WHERE WE CAN

19:23.133 --> 19:25.666
SUE EACH OTHER IF SOMEONE

19:25.733 --> 19:27.166
DOESN'T SEND THEIR SHARE AMOUNT.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.300
IT'S REALLY A CONTRACT WRITTEN

19:29.366 --> 19:31.466
ON OUR HEARTS.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.966
>> John: OH, RIGHT, IT'S A

19:33.033 --> 19:34.933
CONTRACT WRITTEN ON YOUR HEARTS.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.600
FIGURATIVELY, OF COURSE.

19:36.666 --> 19:37.766
BECAUSE LITERALLY, IT'S NOT A

19:37.833 --> 19:39.400
CONTRACT.

19:39.466 --> 19:41.233
AND AS FOR HIS CLAIM THERE THAT

19:41.300 --> 19:42.833
LIBERTY SUCCESSFULLY SHARED

19:42.900 --> 19:45.233
100% OF MEDICAL BILLS "FOR EVERY

19:45.300 --> 19:45.900
ELIGIBLE NEED" -- GIVEN,

19:45.966 --> 19:47.333
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED, THEY CAN

19:47.400 --> 19:49.266
DEEM ANY NEED INELIGIBLE FOR

19:49.333 --> 19:50.700
ANY REASON, THAT PHRASE IS

19:50.766 --> 19:53.000
ESSENTIALLY AS MEANINGLESS AS

19:53.066 --> 19:54.366
THEIR CARDIAC NON-CONTRACT.

19:54.433 --> 19:55.766
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THERE'S

19:55.833 --> 19:57.266
THE PRACTICAL MATTER OF HOW

19:57.333 --> 19:58.000
EXACTLY YOU PAY FOR YOUR CARE

19:58.066 --> 19:59.900
AS A MEMBER.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.133
THE HCSM PROCESS TYPICALLY IS,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.233
YOU'RE TOLD TO PRESENT YOURSELF

20:02.300 --> 20:03.900
AS UNINSURED.

20:03.966 --> 20:05.500
THEN, WHEN YOU GET YOUR BILL,

20:05.566 --> 20:07.300
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU

20:07.366 --> 20:08.466
BARGAIN DOWN THE COST OF YOUR

20:08.533 --> 20:10.800
CARE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,

20:10.866 --> 20:13.533
THEN PAY THE BILL YOURSELF,

20:13.600 --> 20:14.066
THEN SUBMIT YOUR BILLS TO

20:14.133 --> 20:15.800
THE MINISTRY FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.566
AND IF YOU'VE EVER WAITED FOR

20:17.633 --> 20:18.900
YOUR FRIENDS TO VENMO YOU AFTER

20:18.966 --> 20:20.700
PAYING FOR DINNER, YOU KNOW THAT

20:20.766 --> 20:22.133
THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS CAN GO

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
VERY WRONG.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.600
PARTICIPANTS IN LIBERTY --

20:25.666 --> 20:26.466
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE

20:26.533 --> 20:30.000
"HEART CONTRACT" -- HAVE FOUND

20:30.066 --> 20:30.733
PAYMENTS CAN BE SLOW TO

20:30.800 --> 20:31.533
NONEXISTENT.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.000
>> IN THE PAST THREE YEARS,

20:33.066 --> 20:33.666
TIFFANY SCHULTZ WITH THE

20:33.733 --> 20:34.800
WISCONSIN BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU

20:34.866 --> 20:36.566
SAYS THE BBB HAS TAKEN MORE THAN

20:36.633 --> 20:38.000
500 COMPLAINTS ABOUT LIBERTY

20:38.066 --> 20:38.833
HEALTHSHARE, MANY WITH SIMILAR

20:38.900 --> 20:40.166
STORIES.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.700
ONE CLAIMING $90,000 IN

20:41.766 --> 20:43.066
OUTSTANDING IN MEDICAL BILLS

20:43.133 --> 20:44.833
THAT WERE PRE-APPROVED.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.100
>> EITHER THE CONSUMER IS OUT

20:46.166 --> 20:47.466
THE MONEY AND HASN'T BEEN

20:47.533 --> 20:49.233
REIMBURSED, OR THEY'RE ENDING UP

20:49.300 --> 20:50.900
GOING TO COLLECTIONS.

20:50.966 --> 20:53.400
>> John: THAT'S NOT GREAT.

20:53.466 --> 20:54.933
AND WHILE LIBERTY CLAIMS THAT

20:55.000 --> 20:56.366
2019 WAS A PARTICULARLY

20:56.433 --> 20:57.866
DIFFICULT YEAR, AND THAT THEY'RE

20:57.933 --> 20:59.466
PROUD OF IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE

20:59.533 --> 21:01.066
MADE SINCE THEN, IT'S WORTH

21:01.133 --> 21:02.066
NOTING THAT LIBERTY'S MEMBERS

21:02.133 --> 21:03.233
STILL SEEM PRETTY ACTIVE ON

21:03.300 --> 21:04.766
THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU

21:04.833 --> 21:07.166
WEBSITE, WHERE THEY'VE LOGGED

21:07.233 --> 21:09.100
304 COMPLAINTS IN THE LAST

21:09.166 --> 21:10.366
12 MONTHS, WHICH IS A LOT,

21:10.433 --> 21:11.800
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

21:11.866 --> 21:13.500
THAT CIGNA -- A MASSIVE INSURER

21:13.566 --> 21:15.033
-- HAS JUST HALF THAT AMOUNT,

21:15.100 --> 21:16.200
WHILE HAVING 15 TIMES

21:16.266 --> 21:17.666
THE MEMBERS.

21:17.733 --> 21:23.100
AND IMAGINE HAVING MORE PEOPLE

21:23.166 --> 21:25.166
COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU THAN ABOUT

21:25.233 --> 21:27.233
CIGNA, A COMPANY WHOSE LOGO IS A

21:27.300 --> 21:28.433
CARTOON MAN STANDING IN A FIELD

21:28.500 --> 21:30.933
AS HIS HEAD EXPLODES FROM

21:31.000 --> 21:31.733
DEALING WITH THEIR CUSTOMER

21:31.800 --> 21:31.966
SERVICE.

21:32.033 --> 21:32.866
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IN MOST

21:32.933 --> 21:33.866
STATES, A COMPLAINT TO THE

21:33.933 --> 21:35.000
BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU IS

21:35.066 --> 21:35.633
BASICALLY ALL THE RECOURSE

21:35.700 --> 21:36.800
YOU HAVE.

21:36.866 --> 21:38.266
AND THESE MINISTRIES HAVE WORKED

21:38.333 --> 21:40.200
VERY HARD TO KEEP ACCOUNTABILITY

21:40.266 --> 21:41.533
AT BAY, SUCCESSFULLY LOBBYING

21:41.600 --> 21:44.800
FOR SO-CALLED "SAFE HARBOR LAWS"

21:44.866 --> 21:47.033
IN MORE THAN 30 STATES, ENSURING

21:47.100 --> 21:48.600
THEY CAN OPERATE SAFELY OUTSIDE

21:48.666 --> 21:50.266
OF INSURANCE REGULATIONS.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.133
AND TO SEE JUST HOW MUCH YOU CAN

21:52.200 --> 21:53.166
GET AWAY WITH, IT'S WORTH

21:53.233 --> 21:54.900
LOOKING AT A COMPANY CALLED

21:54.966 --> 21:56.500
ALIERA, WHICH HAS BEEN HEAVILY

21:56.566 --> 21:57.766
INVOLVED WITH A NUMBER OF

21:57.833 --> 22:00.200
HEALTH-SHARING MINISTRIES OVER

22:00.266 --> 22:02.200
THE YEARS -- FIRST, ONE CALLED

22:02.266 --> 22:03.333
UNITY, THEN ONE CALLED TRINITY,

22:03.400 --> 22:05.466
WHICH NOW GOES BY SHARITY.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.733
ALTHOUGH THOSE NAMES SOUND LESS

22:06.800 --> 22:08.966
LIKE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS

22:09.033 --> 22:10.066
AND MORE LIKE CHARACTERS IN A

22:10.133 --> 22:11.633
RELIGIOUS-THEMED CAPTAIN PLANET

22:11.700 --> 22:13.300
KNOCKOFF -- WHEN THEIR POWERS

22:13.366 --> 22:14.233
COMBINE, THEY GET CANCELED AFTER

22:14.300 --> 22:15.933
TWO EPISODES.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.233
ALIERA PRESENTS ITSELF AS MERELY

22:18.300 --> 22:21.466
AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR HCSMs,

22:21.533 --> 22:24.366
BUT IT'S INTRICATELY CONNECTED

22:24.433 --> 22:29.000
TO THE ONES IT WORKS WITH, AND

22:29.066 --> 22:30.100
VERY MUCH BY DESIGN.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.633
JUST SIX WEEKS AFTER TRINITY WAS

22:31.700 --> 22:32.800
INCORPORATED, IT SIGNED A DEAL

22:32.866 --> 22:33.400
WITH ALIERA STIPULATING THAT

22:33.466 --> 22:34.500
ALIERA WOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE

22:34.566 --> 22:35.500
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO THE

22:35.566 --> 22:36.666
MEMBERSHIP ROSTER, AND WAS

22:36.733 --> 22:38.466
THE SOLE PARTY DEVELOPING AND

22:38.533 --> 22:39.800
MARKETING THE PLANS INCLUDING

22:39.866 --> 22:41.600
THE HCSM COMPONENT.

22:41.666 --> 22:44.000
SO ALIERA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH

22:44.066 --> 22:45.133
TRINITY IS BASICALLY THIS GUY'S

22:45.200 --> 22:46.066
RELATIONSHIP TO HIS ALIEN

22:46.133 --> 22:47.433
COSTUME.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.966
HE CAN CLAIM THAT HE ISN'T

22:50.033 --> 22:50.866
TECHNICALLY THE COSTUME,

22:50.933 --> 22:52.100
AND THAT'S TRUE.

22:52.166 --> 22:53.300
BUT THE COSTUME DOESN'T REALLY

22:53.366 --> 22:55.233
DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HIM.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.466
AND CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE STATES

22:57.533 --> 22:58.966
HAVE CLAIMED THAT ALIERA AND ITS

22:59.033 --> 23:00.466
MINISTRIES HAVE BEEN RUTHLESS

23:00.533 --> 23:01.966
IN DENYING COVERAGE, WIELDING

23:02.033 --> 23:03.900
"MORALITY CLAUSES" HARD.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.433
WHEN ONE MEMBER WAS ATTACKED AND

23:05.500 --> 23:06.666
KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS OUTSIDE A

23:06.733 --> 23:08.700
BAR AND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

23:08.766 --> 23:10.466
WITH SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING

23:10.533 --> 23:12.166
A SKULL FRACTURE, CERVICAL SPINE

23:12.233 --> 23:14.000
FRACTURE, AND INTERCRANIAL

23:14.066 --> 23:16.033
BLEEDING, ALIERA DENIED HER

23:16.100 --> 23:17.866
CLAIMS, STATING HER INJURIES

23:17.933 --> 23:19.366
WERE "SELF-INFLICTED," AND

23:19.433 --> 23:20.700
CITING THEIR GUIDELINES,

23:20.766 --> 23:21.800
INCLUDING THE LINE, "FOLLOW

23:21.866 --> 23:24.000
SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS ON THE USE

23:24.066 --> 23:28.866
OR ABUSE OF ALCOHOL" WHICH IS,

23:28.933 --> 23:31.266
I'M PRETTY SURE IS THE

23:31.333 --> 23:32.333
BENEVOLENT ADVICE

23:32.400 --> 23:35.866
JESUS WOULD HAVE GIVEN

23:35.933 --> 23:36.600
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.566
AND INCREDIBLY, THAT'S NOT EVEN

23:37.633 --> 23:38.400
THE WORST STORY OF A REJECTED

23:38.466 --> 23:41.200
CLAIM INVOLVING ALIERA.

23:41.266 --> 23:42.200
>> 10-YEAR-OLD LOLA GRACE SEGARS

23:42.266 --> 23:43.333
IS HEALTHY JUST FOUR MONTHS

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
AFTER BRAIN SURGERY.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.600
ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, SHE WAS

23:45.666 --> 23:46.800
RUSHED FROM THE LOCAL E.R. IN

23:46.866 --> 23:47.400
GREENE COUNTY BY AMBULANCE TO

23:47.466 --> 23:47.866
CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE

23:47.933 --> 23:49.166
SCOTTISH RITE, WHERE DOCTORS

23:49.233 --> 23:49.666
REMOVED A SOFTBALL-SIZED

23:49.733 --> 23:50.400
BRAIN TUMOR.

23:50.466 --> 23:51.400
>> IT WAS JUST AMAZING,

23:51.466 --> 23:52.866
THE CARE.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.200
>> BUT LAST WEEK CAME THE BILL

23:54.266 --> 23:55.066
FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN, ALIERA

23:55.133 --> 23:57.400
COMPANIES.

23:57.466 --> 24:00.600
>> $325,624.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.766
>> ALIERA SAYS CHILDREN'S IS OUT

24:01.833 --> 24:03.766
OF NETWORK AND WON'T PAY THE

24:03.833 --> 24:04.866
$325,000 BILL.

24:04.933 --> 24:06.466
>> WE HAD A LIFE-THREATENING

24:06.533 --> 24:07.666
EMERGENCY.

24:07.733 --> 24:11.133
THEY FAILED US AND HER.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.100
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.333
THEY WERE DENIED REIMBURSEMENT

24:15.400 --> 24:17.066
FOR A CHILD WHO HAD

24:17.133 --> 24:18.500
A SOFTBALL-SIZED TUMOR REMOVED

24:18.566 --> 24:20.800
FROM HER BRAIN, WHICH IS,

24:20.866 --> 24:21.400
INCIDENTALLY, EXACTLY THE KIND

24:21.466 --> 24:22.100
OF IMMORAL BEHAVIOR I'D EXPECT

24:22.166 --> 24:23.600
SHARING MINISTRIES TO CLASSIFY

24:23.666 --> 24:26.833
AS FUCKING DISQUALIFYING.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.333
NOW, ALIERA CLAIMS THAT FAMILY'S

24:28.400 --> 24:29.566
ISSUES WERE ULTIMATELY RESOLVED,

24:29.633 --> 24:30.900
BUT ONLY AFTER THAT STORY

24:30.966 --> 24:32.500
WAS FEATURED ON THE NEWS.

24:32.566 --> 24:34.566
AND IT SHOWS JUST HOW LITTLE

24:34.633 --> 24:36.400
RECOURSE YOU HAVE, THAT IF YOU

24:36.466 --> 24:38.366
DON'T HAVE A CHILD YOU CAN GET

24:38.433 --> 24:40.033
ON TV TO SHAME THE COMPANY INTO

24:40.100 --> 24:40.866
ACTION, YOU COULD BE SHIT OUT OF

24:40.933 --> 24:42.733
LUCK.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.766
AND LOOK, TRADITIONAL INSURANCE

24:44.833 --> 24:46.466
COMPANIES ALSO HAVE THEIR SHARE

24:46.533 --> 24:47.100
OF HORROR STORIES WHEN IT COMES

24:47.166 --> 24:48.200
TO DENIAL OF COVERAGE.

24:48.266 --> 24:50.133
BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT

24:50.200 --> 24:51.266
DIFFERENCES HERE -- NOT JUST IN

24:51.333 --> 24:52.900
THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION YOU HAVE

24:52.966 --> 24:53.666
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, BUT IN THE

24:53.733 --> 24:54.500
DEGREE OF FINANCIAL

24:54.566 --> 24:56.933
ACCOUNTABILITY.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.566
BECAUSE WHILE THE ACA REQUIRES

24:58.633 --> 25:00.400
ACTUAL HEALTH INSURERS TO SPEND

25:00.466 --> 25:02.866
NO MORE THAN 20% OF MONEY ON

25:02.933 --> 25:04.800
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, THEREFORE

25:04.866 --> 25:06.233
LEAVING AT LEAST 80% FOR CARE,

25:06.300 --> 25:07.933
THERE'S NO SUCH REQUIREMENT FOR

25:08.000 --> 25:09.966
HCSMs.

25:10.033 --> 25:11.266
AND YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WHERE

25:11.333 --> 25:13.333
THIS IS GOING.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.333
BECAUSE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE

25:15.400 --> 25:16.733
FOUND THAT OUT OF EVERY $100

25:16.800 --> 25:18.333
A TRINITY MEMBER PAID IN

25:18.400 --> 25:20.466
PREMIUMS, ONLY $16 WENT TOWARDS

25:20.533 --> 25:22.533
PAYING MEDICAL EXPENSES,

25:22.600 --> 25:23.466
WITH THE REST BEING KICKED UP TO

25:23.533 --> 25:25.566
ALIERA.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.533
AND PAYING OUT 16% OF THE MONEY

25:27.600 --> 25:29.066
YOU TAKE IN FOR COVERAGE IS

25:29.133 --> 25:29.933
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN PAYING OUT

25:30.000 --> 25:31.466
80.

25:31.533 --> 25:32.966
BECAUSE 80% MAKES YOU THINK,

25:33.033 --> 25:34.533
"WAIT, WHY EXACTLY DO WE HAVE

25:34.600 --> 25:35.866
INSURANCE COMPANIES?"

25:35.933 --> 25:37.633
WHEREAS 16 MAKES YOU THINK,

25:37.700 --> 25:38.933
"IS A CRIME HAPPENING TO ME

25:39.000 --> 25:40.266
RIGHT NOW, AND IF SO, WHY DOES

25:40.333 --> 25:42.233
EVERYONE SEEM OKAY WITH IT?"

25:42.300 --> 25:45.300
AND WHEN A LOCAL NEWS REPORTER

25:45.366 --> 25:45.833
CAUGHT UP WITH THE HEAD OF

25:45.900 --> 25:49.133
ALIERA TO ASK HER ABOUT ITS

25:49.200 --> 25:50.066
RELUCTANCE TO PAY OUT CLAIMS,

25:50.133 --> 25:50.966
HER RESPONSE WAS NOT

25:51.033 --> 25:52.233
PARTICULARLY REASSURING.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.233
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY APOLOGIES

25:53.300 --> 25:54.266
TO THE MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE THEIR

25:54.333 --> 25:57.033
CLAIMS OUGHT TO BE PAID AND

25:57.100 --> 25:57.800
THEY'RE NOT PAID?

25:57.866 --> 25:58.333
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.366
WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT A HEALTH

25:59.433 --> 26:00.266
-- WE'RE NOT A

26:00.333 --> 26:01.333
HEALTH CARE-SHARING MINISTRY,

26:01.400 --> 26:01.766
MR. STRICKLAND.

26:01.833 --> 26:02.533
WE ONLY ADMINISTER ON BEHALF

26:02.600 --> 26:03.400
OF THE -- OF THE MINISTRIES.

26:03.466 --> 26:04.666
I CAN'T HELP YOU ANY FURTHER.

26:04.733 --> 26:06.500
I NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.766
>> John: OKAY, IT'S NEVER A

26:08.833 --> 26:09.733
GOOD SIGN WHEN A CEO HAS TO END

26:09.800 --> 26:11.000
AN INTERVIEW LIKE THAT.

26:11.066 --> 26:12.266
"AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, OUR

26:12.333 --> 26:13.433
COMPANY HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING

26:13.500 --> 26:14.200
ILLEGAL.

26:14.266 --> 26:16.233
NOW HAVE YOU SEEN A MAN IN

26:16.300 --> 26:17.000
A BLUE FEDORA?

26:17.066 --> 26:17.900
HE'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME A NEW

26:17.966 --> 26:18.933
IDENTITY AS I GET PULLED INTO

26:19.000 --> 26:19.800
A HELICOPTER THAT'S ALREADY

26:19.866 --> 26:20.100
TAKING OFF.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.766
TELL MY DAUGHTER I LOVED HER AND

26:21.833 --> 26:22.400
MY HUSBAND I DIDN'T!

26:22.466 --> 26:24.966
I'M OUT!"

26:25.033 --> 26:26.233
NOW I SHOULD SAY, OTHER SHARING

26:26.300 --> 26:27.566
MINISTRIES HAVE TRIED TO

26:27.633 --> 26:28.766
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM ALIERA,

26:28.833 --> 26:30.066
CLAIMING THAT, "THIS SORT OF

26:30.133 --> 26:31.866
DECEPTION IS NOT PART OF

26:31.933 --> 26:33.966
LEGITIMATE, AUTHENTIC HEALTH

26:34.033 --> 26:34.500
CARE SHARING MINISTRIES."

26:34.566 --> 26:35.633
AND ALIERA IS DEFINITELY BAD.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.000
BUT ONE THING INSURANCE

26:37.066 --> 26:38.566
COMMISSIONERS HAVE REPEATEDLY

26:38.633 --> 26:40.100
TOLD US IN RESEARCHING THIS

26:40.166 --> 26:41.633
PIECE IS HOW LITTLE TRANSPARENCY

26:41.700 --> 26:43.133
THERE IS INTO HOW THESE

26:43.200 --> 26:46.066
MINISTRIES OPERATE, AND JUST HOW

26:46.133 --> 26:47.033
WARY THEY THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE

26:47.100 --> 26:50.000
OF ALL OF THEM.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.600
AND LOOK, BROADLY, WE HAVE TO

26:51.666 --> 26:53.400
DO MORE IN THIS COUNTRY TO

26:53.466 --> 26:54.833
REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE

26:54.900 --> 26:55.533
-- PERSONALLY, I'D ARGUE

26:55.600 --> 26:57.100
SWITCHING TO A SINGLE-PAYER

26:57.166 --> 26:57.933
SYSTEM WOULD REMOVE A LOT OF

26:58.000 --> 26:59.133
THESE PROBLEMS INSTANTLY,

26:59.200 --> 26:59.766
BUT THAT CLEARLY ISN'T HAPPENING

26:59.833 --> 27:01.200
ANYTIME SOON.

27:01.266 --> 27:03.166
SO IN THE MEANTIME, I DO GET

27:03.233 --> 27:04.366
THE APPEAL OF LOWER-COST

27:04.433 --> 27:06.400
HEALTH INSURANCE.

27:06.466 --> 27:08.833
THE PROBLEM IS, THIS ISN'T THAT.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.633
IT'S NOT INSURANCE AT ALL.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.500
AND STATES NEED, AT THE VERY

27:12.566 --> 27:15.066
LEAST, TO PASS LAWS TO MAKE SURE

27:15.133 --> 27:17.166
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

27:17.233 --> 27:18.533
INTO WITH HCSMs, AND TO FORCE

27:18.600 --> 27:21.266
THEM TO ALLOCATE FUNDS PROPERLY.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.100
THE PROBLEM IS, SOME ARE GOING

27:22.166 --> 27:23.566
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

27:23.633 --> 27:25.333
TAKE FLORIDA.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.300
IN 2018, AFTER INTENSE LOBBYING,

27:27.366 --> 27:29.633
IT LOOSENED ITS RESTRICTIONS ON

27:29.700 --> 27:30.666
HCSMs EVEN FURTHER, GOING FROM

27:30.733 --> 27:32.233
REQUIRING PARTICIPANTS BE

27:32.300 --> 27:34.533
"MEMBERS OF THE SAME RELIGION,"

27:34.600 --> 27:36.566
TO MERELY REQUIRING THEY

27:36.633 --> 27:37.900
"SHARE A COMMON SET OF ETHICAL

27:37.966 --> 27:39.266
OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS."

27:39.333 --> 27:40.233
AND THAT COULD BE BASICALLY

27:40.300 --> 27:42.500
ANYTHING.

27:42.566 --> 27:44.366
AT THIS POINT, THE BAR TO ENTRY

27:44.433 --> 27:46.166
IS SO LOW, JUST ABOUT ANYONE CAN

27:46.233 --> 27:48.733
BECOME AN HCSM.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.333
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

27:50.400 --> 27:52.966
THIS ANYONE DID.

27:53.033 --> 27:54.333
YOU MAY REMEMBER, BACK IN 2015,

27:54.400 --> 27:56.033
WE FOUNDED A CHURCH, OUR LADY

27:56.100 --> 27:57.533
OF PERPETUAL EXEMPTION, TO

27:57.600 --> 27:58.666
DEMONSTRATE THAT TAX EXEMPTIONS

27:58.733 --> 27:59.966
FOR CHURCHES ENABLED SOME OF

28:00.033 --> 28:02.033
THEM TO DO TERRIBLE THINGS.

28:02.100 --> 28:03.266
WELL, JUST THREE MONTHS AGO,

28:03.333 --> 28:05.200
WE OFFICIALLY FOUNDED A SPINOFF

28:05.266 --> 28:06.066
CHURCH CALLED "OUR LADY OF

28:06.133 --> 28:07.766
PERPETUAL HEALTH."

28:07.833 --> 28:08.933
AND WE FOUNDED IT -- WHERE ELSE?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.733
-- BUT FLORIDA.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.100
I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU, THAT

28:12.166 --> 28:13.800
CHURCH NOW HAS ITS OWN HEALTH

28:13.866 --> 28:14.533
CARE SHARING MINISTRY,

28:14.600 --> 28:16.333
"JOHNNYCARE."

28:16.400 --> 28:17.433
AND THE WHOLE THING WAS SCARILY

28:17.500 --> 28:19.433
EASY TO DO.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.566
SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

28:21.633 --> 28:23.766
PLEASE JOIN ME, MY MOST BLESSED

28:23.833 --> 28:27.400
CONGREGANTS, AT CHURCH.

28:27.466 --> 28:28.933
AND YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T RUN

28:29.000 --> 28:30.800
AN ORGANIZATION AS IMPORTANT

28:30.866 --> 28:31.766
AS THIS MINISTRY ALL BY MYSELF.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.333
SO PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE FROM

28:53.733 --> 28:54.900

28:54.966 --> 28:58.766

28:58.833 --> 29:01.166
>> John: AMEN TO THAT.

29:01.233 --> 29:03.100
>> I HAVE HEARD THE WORD OF THE

29:03.166 --> 29:03.433
LORD, MY JOHN.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.000

29:06.066 --> 29:08.666
MY WANDA?

29:08.733 --> 29:12.500

29:20.100 --> 29:21.400
MINISTRY AS A CHURCH EVEN THOUGH

29:21.466 --> 29:22.900
IN FLORIDA, WE ACTUALLY DON'T

29:22.966 --> 29:24.500
HAVE TO BE.

29:24.566 --> 29:25.833
>> AMEN, PRAISE FLORIDA.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.166
>> John: BUT WE DO NEED TO

29:27.233 --> 29:29.100
FILL THE REQUIREMENT THAT OUR

29:29.166 --> 29:29.933
MINISTRY PROVIDE FOR THE

29:30.000 --> 29:32.300
FINANCIAL OR MEDICAL NEEDS OF

29:32.366 --> 29:33.066
PARTICIPANTS FROM CONTRIBUTIONS

29:33.133 --> 29:33.566
FROM OTHER PARTICIPANTS.

29:33.633 --> 29:36.000
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE HAVE DONE

29:36.066 --> 29:37.433
THAT THROUGH OUR SPECIAL

29:37.500 --> 29:38.533
JOHNNYCARE FIRST AID KIT

29:38.600 --> 29:40.766
CONTAINING NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT

29:40.833 --> 29:43.133
THREE BAND-AIDS.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.333
IT SCREAMS THE CHEAPEST OPTION

29:44.400 --> 29:45.433
THAT WE COULD FIND.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, MY WANDA?

29:48.066 --> 29:49.833
>> WHAT, MY JOHN?

29:49.900 --> 29:52.100
>> John: IT WAS.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.033
>> WHY THREE BAND-AIDS?

29:54.100 --> 29:55.900
WE KNOW THAT, ALAS, SOMETIMES,

29:55.966 --> 29:56.566
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

29:56.633 --> 29:58.166
BUT IF THEY HAPPEN MORE THAN

29:58.233 --> 30:00.700
THREE TIMES, IT JUST STOPS BEING

30:00.766 --> 30:01.266
OUR PROBLEM.

30:01.333 --> 30:01.933
>> John: AND LET ME BE CLEAR,

30:02.033 --> 30:03.733
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR MEMBERSHIP,

30:03.800 --> 30:05.200
YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR YOUR OWN

30:05.966 --> 30:07.100
YOU ARE PAYING FOR SOMEONE

30:07.166 --> 30:09.100

30:09.166 --> 30:09.400
YOURS.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.133
A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.100
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL CARE, YOU GO

30:19.166 --> 30:20.600
TO THE DOCTOR, YOU RECEIVE IT,

30:20.666 --> 30:21.866
YOU REQUEST A BILL, AND THEN YOU

30:21.933 --> 30:24.766
PAY THAT BILL ON YOUR OWN.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.100
>> LEAVE US OUT OF IT.

30:26.166 --> 30:26.333
[LAUGHS]

30:26.400 --> 30:27.366
>> John: OH, YEAH, BECAUSE IF

30:27.433 --> 30:29.333
YOU SUBMIT THAT BILL TO US, WE

30:29.400 --> 30:30.166
ARE GOING TO REJECT IT.
