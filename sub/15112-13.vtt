WEBVTT

00:11.967 --> 00:12.783
Yeah?

00:13.033 --> 00:14.180
I want to see you.

00:14.430 --> 00:15.849
Is something wrong?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.226
I've missed you.

00:18.476 --> 00:22.772
I've made a reservation
at the Silver Saddle Motel.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.150
Check in.
I'll meet you in 45 minutes.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.068
I'm swamped this morning, Tricia.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.435
It's not gonna happen.

00:28.685 --> 00:31.114
I will see that you don't regret i

00:34.257 --> 00:37.287
What the hell
is the Silver Saddle Motel?

00:37.537 --> 00:40.790
A place where no one
will complain about the noise.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.334
I'll see you in 45 minutes.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.613 --> 01:56.324
Yes, sir, officer.

02:15.551 --> 02:17.929
Carl, Britten knows.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.045
What?

02:19.295 --> 02:21.681
He knows about Hawkins.
He knows about you.

02:21.931 --> 02:24.144
He knows about Westfield.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.052
He knows about the storage locker.

02:26.302 --> 02:27.954
What?!
What are you talking about?

02:28.204 --> 02:29.524
Come out here.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.944
He shot Hawkins, Carl.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.612
He's dead.

02:34.862 --> 02:36.195
Even if we move everything,

02:36.445 --> 02:40.118
the Hawkins investigation
would lead them back to you.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.317
And then what would you do?

02:43.519 --> 02:46.291
What do you mean, "shot Hawkins"?

02:46.541 --> 02:49.210
Get out here!
Take these cuffs off of me!

02:50.426 --> 02:51.713
You'd tell them about me.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.423
Trish, what are you doing?

02:55.341 --> 02:56.885
I'm sorry.

03:59.310 --> 04:02.685
Episode 1x13: <i>Turtles All the Way Down</i>
<i>Presync: Yvon</i>

04:14.295 --> 04:15.338
So, somewhere in the neighborhood

04:15.588 --> 04:16.505
of 200 keys.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.574
It looks like a shipment
Narcotics seized

04:18.824 --> 04:20.262
early last year.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.050
And we also raided
Kessel's home and office.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.513
And everything's preliminary,

04:23.763 --> 04:26.599
but the forensic accountants
say it looks like he and Hawkins

04:26.849 --> 04:28.222
moved a lot of money
into offshore accounts.

04:28.472 --> 04:29.165
What's Kessel say?

04:30.333 --> 04:31.229
We haven't found him yet.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.827
Why not? Where is he?

04:33.077 --> 04:35.496
I did my best to keep
the operation under wraps,

04:35.746 --> 04:37.277
but he's obviously got
ears everywhere.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.200
Word is he "stepped out"

04:39.450 --> 04:40.780
just before we raided
the storage unit.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.283
All right, here's what we
should do... Everyone with

04:43.533 --> 04:44.784
a badge is already looking for him.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.786
There'll be something
at Hawkins' house.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.109
IA's already searching the scene.

04:48.359 --> 04:49.643
It'll take some time,
but when they're done,

04:49.893 --> 04:51.666
they'll need to talk to you.
Excuse me, Captain.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.959
They found Captain Kessel.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.821
Hey, guys. Looks like he saw
the walls were closing in,

05:00.071 --> 05:01.926
took the easy way out.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.291
Desk says he checked in
under the name of Ed Munte

05:04.541 --> 05:06.764
right around the time you
and the boys were gearing up.

05:07.014 --> 05:08.796
And the place is pretty empty
around 11:00 AM.

05:09.046 --> 05:10.226
And the neighborhood isn't so great,

05:10.476 --> 05:12.520
so even when they thought
they heard a gunshot,

05:12.770 --> 05:14.550
they didn't guess it came
from one of the rooms.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.857
Maid found him about 30 minutes ago.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.280
You wanted to catch him.

05:23.374 --> 05:24.218
No.

05:25.162 --> 05:27.285
I wanted to kill him.

05:36.874 --> 05:39.631
We just started to dig
through Hawkins' records.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.696
- Thought you'd like to see that.
- What is it?

05:41.946 --> 05:44.098
It's a repair estimate
for Hawkins' car.

05:44.348 --> 05:45.499
A week after your accident.

05:45.749 --> 05:47.472
Damage to the right front
quarter panel.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.075
I wish this could all be different.

05:54.325 --> 05:57.774
I wish I... I wish I
could go back and stop it.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.196
It wasn't your job to stop it.

06:03.034 --> 06:06.699
When I needed your help...
you listened to me.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.205
You took a risk.

06:14.078 --> 06:15.625
Thanks

06:15.875 --> 06:18.044
We should be thanking you.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.268
Without you, we would
have missed all this.

06:20.518 --> 06:21.969
It's gonna be rough for a whe,

06:22.219 --> 06:25.260
but when the dust settles,
I want you to know

06:25.510 --> 06:28.054
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure
that you receive the proper commendation.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.640
I don't want a commendation.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.226
What do you want?

06:36.867 --> 06:39.135
I want my family back.

06:40.971 --> 06:42.872
That's what I want.

06:45.409 --> 06:47.865
We're so proud of you, Michael.

06:48.115 --> 06:49.612
Yeah.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.788
Hannah would be proud of you, too.

07:30.385 --> 07:31.743
Get up.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.872
Get up.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.921
Get up.

07:44.901 --> 07:46.469
Hey!

07:58.982 --> 08:01.981
I don't know. It looks like
he lost a lot of blood.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.972
Harper's got a team working
on Bird's body right now.

08:05.222 --> 08:07.570
They're gonna need you to paint
a picture for 'em pretty quick.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.739
Well, I could put him down
right here.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.284
Yeah, okay. Get him over
to our area first.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.245
I'll make sure you get
a friendly investigation.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.414
Okay. I got it.

08:21.772 --> 08:23.336
It's almost over.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.755
Then you can go be with your boy.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.864
Yes, we need an ambulance
at Park and Western.

09:34.445 --> 09:36.576
Michael, please.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.827
Please.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.396
Pele...

10:05.646 --> 10:07.744
what did you do?

10:19.523 --> 10:23.125
You have a medical degree, right?

10:31.338 --> 10:33.174
Detective Britten, I don't
have the right supplies.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.383
Just do it.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.260
Listen to me. This shot
goes all the way through.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.438
You've lost a lot of blood.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.106
You've got a high fever.

10:39.356 --> 10:40.306
You're probably already septic.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.350
Just patch me up.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.713
Can you tell me who shot you?

10:45.963 --> 10:47.313
Hawkins.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.191
Detective Hawkins?
The man that you

10:50.441 --> 10:51.118
dreamed was responsible for...?

10:51.368 --> 10:52.419
I didn't dream anything.

10:52.669 --> 10:54.320
It's the man who admitted to me

10:54.570 --> 10:55.905
that he killed my son.

10:56.155 --> 10:56.940
Okay.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.126
He framed me for killing Bird,

10:59.376 --> 11:02.620
and he was about to kill me,
and I just managed to get away.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.788
Bird's been killed?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.599
They-They knew we were
closing in on him,

11:05.849 --> 11:07.500
so they had to get rid of us.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.960
Who's they?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.046
Hawkins and his area captain, Kessel.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.714
So, now an area captain's involved?

11:13.964 --> 11:15.925
Don't talk to me like I'm crazy.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.578
I can prove it.
I did prove it.

11:17.828 --> 11:18.879
Why do you think Kessel
killed himself

11:19.129 --> 11:20.304
when they came to get him?

11:20.554 --> 11:21.882
Kessel killed himself?

11:22.132 --> 11:23.817
They're giving me a commendation;

11:24.067 --> 11:25.886
you're talking to me
like I'm a lunatic.

11:26.136 --> 11:27.321
Wait.
Who's giving you a commendation?

11:27.571 --> 11:28.689
Harper, my captain.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.606
I thought that you were
being suspended.

11:30.856 --> 11:35.403
Not here. At, at, um...

11:35.653 --> 11:37.398
Over in...

11:37.648 --> 11:41.001
Look... believe me.

11:41.251 --> 11:43.236
I know what I'm talking about.

11:43.486 --> 11:45.162
I am not the bad guy here.

11:45.412 --> 11:47.540
I believe you, Detective.
I do.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.311
No, you don't. No, you don't.

11:50.561 --> 11:52.378
You're not even good at faking it.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.508
I believe that this is
all real to you.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.453
I believe that you've been trying

11:59.703 --> 12:01.789
to keep two sets of facts straight,

12:02.039 --> 12:04.458
one that is happening
and full of painful realities,

12:04.708 --> 12:06.593
and one that you've
imagined in response.

12:06.843 --> 12:08.978
And I believe
that under these conditions,

12:09.228 --> 12:11.865
anyone could begin to lose track
of which was which.

12:12.115 --> 12:13.441
But the truth is, I don't know

12:13.691 --> 12:15.436
what happened last night;
I really don't.

12:15.686 --> 12:17.838
I just know that
you've been seriously injured,

12:18.088 --> 12:19.947
and it sounds like
other people have been as well.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.174
We need to get you help,

12:21.424 --> 12:22.710
and once we get you that help,

12:22.960 --> 12:25.011
I'm sure that all this
is just gonna sort itself out.

12:25.261 --> 12:26.829
So I'm just going
to step outside here...

12:27.079 --> 12:29.999
I have help. You're my help.

12:35.238 --> 12:37.590
I don't think you want
to shoot me, Michael.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.093
Where are your car keys?

12:41.343 --> 12:44.555
Where are we going?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.849
You're going to get your wish.

12:48.819 --> 12:50.728
You're going to turn me in.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.564
<i>Detective, it doesn't look
like we're going</i>

12:53.814 --> 12:54.575
<i>to a police station.</i>

12:54.825 --> 12:56.726
<i>I never said we were.</i>

13:01.614 --> 13:04.084
Can you at least tell me
what we're doing?

13:04.334 --> 13:07.087
We're going to break into one
of the storage units.

13:07.337 --> 13:08.537
Why?

13:08.787 --> 13:13.326
'Cause there's 200 kilos
of heroin in there.

13:13.576 --> 13:17.088
And when they see it,
they'll know I've been set up.

13:23.687 --> 13:25.071
Take my cell phone

13:25.321 --> 13:30.176
and tell them I abducted you,

13:30.426 --> 13:32.603
where you are,
and they'll come and get me.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.165
But first, I want you
to see what's in there.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.972
You can say that you saw it.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.495
No.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.996
I saw it.

13:51.246 --> 13:52.265
They must have moved it.

13:52.515 --> 13:53.416
Detective...

13:53.666 --> 13:55.126
I saw it!

13:56.627 --> 13:58.546
You understand?
I saw it in there!

13:59.380 --> 14:00.089
Why don't we just...?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.173
<i>911. What's ur emergency?</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:13.987
Shout when you hear people.
They'll come and get you.

14:16.761 --> 14:17.973
Detective!

14:20.043 --> 14:21.444
Detective!

14:40.462 --> 14:41.672
Hello.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.048
Vega.

14:43.298 --> 14:45.551
Where are you?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.011
Listen to me.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
The whole department
is looking for you.

14:50.173 --> 14:51.348
What are they saying?

14:51.598 --> 14:53.726
They're saying you shot Bird.

14:57.247 --> 14:58.355
Do you believe 'em?

15:00.851 --> 15:04.037
If you're telling me
that's not what happened...

15:04.287 --> 15:05.571
I trust you.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.745
It's not, and I can prove it.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.120
But I need your help.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.580
Tell me whe you are.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.081
It's not important.

15:16.331 --> 15:18.584
I need you to pull some records
for me.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.961
No. If you want me to trust you,
then you have to trust me.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.089
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come and get you.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.298
I will make sure you're safe.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.675
Let's work this thing out together.

15:28.278 --> 15:29.478
Michael.

15:46.129 --> 15:49.031
Michael, we've got to
get you to a hospital. No.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.075
Look at you, Michael.
Look at you! I trusted you.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.576
No hospital.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.703
Drive.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.918
They must have moved everything
out of the unit last night.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.420
I didn't see any cameras,
but see if the security cameras overlook

16:04.046 --> 16:07.716
the part of the building.
People going in or out.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.387
Then, uh, get the phone records
for Hawkins and Kessel.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.430
How am I supposed to do that?

16:13.680 --> 16:15.474
Ask Harper to help you.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.351
You want me to tell Harper?

16:17.601 --> 16:21.363
She's the only one we can trust now.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.247
Captain, I need to talk to you.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.291
We're in the middle of a manhunt.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.720
I need to take this.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.130
Michael sent me.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.801
Close the door.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.752
The storage unit was takenut
in Kessel's name

16:58.002 --> 16:59.453
a few days after Michael
visited Westfield.

16:59.703 --> 17:01.956
The storage unit that was
supposed to be full of drugs?

17:02.206 --> 17:04.290
Yes. He said
that it must have been moved

17:04.540 --> 17:07.026
once Hawkins realized that Bird
and Michael were onto them.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.861
Stop. Just... just stop.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.031
There's someone
that you need to meet.

17:15.652 --> 17:18.412
Detective Vega, this is Dr. John Lee.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.332
He's been Britten's therapist
since the accident.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.844
This morning Britten
broke into Dr. Lee's house

17:24.094 --> 17:26.420
and took him at gunpoint
to the very storage unit

17:26.670 --> 17:28.315
that you're referring to.

17:28.565 --> 17:30.651
And once he saw
that it was completely empty,

17:30.901 --> 17:31.926
he locked him inside.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.261
- Captain, he's trying to lead us...
- He had become delusional, Vega.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.554
He says...
Detective Vega!

17:37.541 --> 17:40.768
I understand how convincing
Detective Britten sounds,

17:41.018 --> 17:43.130
and that's because everything
that he's telling you

17:43.380 --> 17:46.023
is something he's completely
convinced of himself.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.776
But the truth is, he's unable
to separate what's real

17:49.026 --> 17:50.778
from what's in his imagination.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.106
This vast conspiracy,

17:52.356 --> 17:53.739
these missing drugs,

17:53.989 --> 17:56.110
these people who were trying
to kill him and his family,

17:56.360 --> 17:58.035
it's all in the mind of a man

17:58.285 --> 18:01.163
experiencing a complete mental break.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.627
But Westfield...
No, he ccked into

18:06.877 --> 18:10.422
Westfield last summer.
There was nothing there.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.193
A fractured psyche like Britten's

18:13.443 --> 18:15.262
can take a host of real details,

18:15.512 --> 18:18.499
weave them into an incredibly
elaborate story,

18:18.749 --> 18:20.034
and then constantly adjust it

18:20.284 --> 18:22.601
to sweep away the holes
and inconsistencies.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.938
Add to that the disorientation

18:24.188 --> 18:26.772
caused by the blood loss
and his injuries,

18:27.022 --> 18:30.011
and you have a recipe
for flourishing desions.

18:30.261 --> 18:31.946
He's incapable of understanding

18:32.196 --> 18:34.321
that he's making all of this up.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.785
He needs our help.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.590
Whatever he's told himself,
whatever he believes,

18:43.840 --> 18:46.375
it's led him to fixate
on Detective Hawkins,

18:46.625 --> 18:48.752
kidnap and nearly kill him,

18:49.002 --> 18:50.963
and in the process,
he killed Detective Freeman.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.167
I know that you care about him-

18:53.417 --> 18:55.217
we all do- but that's why

18:55.467 --> 18:58.262
we need to prevent him from
hurting himself or anyone else.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.974
Efrem, where is he?

19:18.075 --> 19:20.117
What is that?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.744
I don't understand.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.957
Hands! Hands! Hands!
Hands! Hands!

19:35.882 --> 19:36.925
Hey, be careful!

19:37.175 --> 19:39.511
I know I should never
have trusted you.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.891
I'm sorry. It's for
your own good, Michael.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.553
This is a mistake! I can prove
it to you! Michael, I'm sorry.

19:46.803 --> 19:47.888
No, no!
They're setting me up!

19:48.138 --> 19:49.489
You did the right thing.

19:49.739 --> 19:51.975
He's gonna get the help he needs.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.647
Michael...

21:15.526 --> 21:17.401
Just give us a few minutes.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.536
How you feeling?

21:27.786 --> 21:29.023
How am I feeling?

21:29.273 --> 21:30.706
I- I don't understand
what I'm doing here.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.827
Michael, I am so sorry.

21:33.077 --> 21:35.029
I really thought that letting
you come back to work

21:35.279 --> 21:36.670
would make things easier for you.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.466
No, it's got no nothing to do
with me going back to work.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.035
I'm...

21:41.285 --> 21:43.603
This isn't some paranoid delusion.

21:43.853 --> 21:45.095
I'm-I'm the same as you are.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.430
Just get a warrant

21:46.680 --> 21:49.057
for Kessel and Hawkins'
phone records and bank records.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.811
Mike, stop. Just... just stop.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.562
I don't want you to make this
any worse for yourself.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.107
You'll see that things are
exactly how I'm telling you.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.236
I st need you to look into it.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.821
Okay? Please.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.324
Tricia, okay? For me.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.693
Just look, please.

22:06.943 --> 22:07.659
Michael...

22:12.038 --> 22:13.916
We're gonna get you
the best help that there is.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.959
Why aren't you listening to me?

22:16.209 --> 22:18.712
And I want to reassure you
that Hannah is gonna be

22:18.962 --> 22:20.380
taken care of as well.
She's not gonna

22:20.630 --> 22:22.191
be alone on this, all right?

22:30.434 --> 22:31.850
<i>Desk says he checked in</i>

22:32.100 --> 22:33.352
under the name of Ed Munte

22:33.602 --> 22:35.437
right around the time you
and the boys were gearing up.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.731
What is it?

22:37.981 --> 22:38.822
What?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.072
You.

22:46.716 --> 22:48.575
I'm sorry?

22:48.825 --> 22:51.119
Ed Munte.

22:51.369 --> 22:54.373
That's the name that Kessel used
to book into the hotel.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.333
Kessel's calling you.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.919
Michael, you're not making any sense.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.672
That's why they knew I was
on to them 'cause...

23:01.922 --> 23:04.258
'Cause you told them.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.009
You killed Rex.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.221
You killed my boy.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.628
She killed my son.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.526
You have a visitor.

25:45.908 --> 25:47.045
Hello.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.798
Hello.

25:52.605 --> 25:54.970
What do you want?

25:55.220 --> 25:56.860
You know what we want.

25:57.110 --> 25:59.641
We need to get Harper.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.853
The clock is ticking.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.021
You hear it?

26:13.613 --> 26:14.739
You understand?

26:16.095 --> 26:17.614
What is that?

26:17.864 --> 26:19.119
What does it mean?

26:19.369 --> 26:21.830
It means she's getting away.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.915
Wh-What can we do?

26:24.165 --> 26:25.889
I can show you.

26:26.139 --> 26:28.024
We can still stop her.

26:28.274 --> 26:29.796
If that's what you want.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.910
You have to be sure.

26:36.949 --> 26:38.889
I'll do anything.

27:55.628 --> 27:57.480
This is fantastic.

27:57.730 --> 27:59.386
This is madness.

28:22.588 --> 28:24.494
This is the sort of breakthrough
I have been waiting for.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.788
He's finally accepting the truth,

28:27.038 --> 28:28.832
reveing what's beea dream
and what's been reality.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.867
He's not accepting reality.

28:31.117 --> 28:33.069
He's fleeing it, allowing it
to fold in on itself.

28:33.319 --> 28:34.546
If he continues to fracture

28:34.796 --> 28:37.465
his psyche in this fashion,
there will not be a way out.

28:37.715 --> 28:38.675
That is alarmist garbage.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.109
Let him make his own choices.

28:40.359 --> 28:43.930
Choices have consequences,
Dr. Evans.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.247
Oh, now you're questioning
my credentials?

28:45.497 --> 28:46.649
You don't exist.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.977
I'm not particularly concerned
with your credentials.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.646
Were I his creation,
it would simply show

28:51.896 --> 28:53.456
that even his imagination
is a better therapist than you.

28:53.706 --> 28:54.858
I am the one who has been

28:55.108 --> 28:56.359
trying to prevent a full-scale break

28:56.609 --> 28:58.153
of exactly this variety. Tied up
in his own head with his guilt.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.691
Enough!

30:11.517 --> 30:13.985
Now, pay very close attention
to this part.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.358
You've seen a penguin before.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.026
Don't look at me; look at them.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.534
Here it is.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.871
And there.

30:34.740 --> 30:36.668
Do you see it?

30:37.947 --> 30:38.962
Look.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.505
There.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.225
There it is.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.588
Now, this is the part that's just...

31:05.838 --> 31:07.198
Tricia...

31:09.909 --> 31:11.911
... mean.

31:17.416 --> 31:19.384
Do you get it?

31:41.357 --> 31:43.875
Sorry, buddy.

32:11.437 --> 32:14.974
Aren't you gonna sit down?

32:15.224 --> 32:17.143
Isn't this place amazing?

32:17.393 --> 32:19.361
It reminds me of that time
when we were in New York,

32:19.611 --> 32:21.297
and I pretended to be...
A food critic.

32:25.684 --> 32:27.445
What's wrong?

32:27.695 --> 32:30.155
I'm afra...

32:32.624 --> 32:34.911
... of never seeing you again.

32:35.161 --> 32:38.706
Of what's gonna happen to me
when all this comes to an end.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.382
I know.

32:40.632 --> 32:43.127
I have to get her,

32:43.377 --> 32:45.964
but I don't want to leave you.

32:47.139 --> 32:50.051
Just give me one last kiss good-bye.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.167
Now go and get her.

34:44.424 --> 34:46.176
You surprised me.

34:46.426 --> 34:48.670
The press is having
a field day with this.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.088
Did IA keep you

34:50.338 --> 34:51.130
here late last night?

34:51.380 --> 34:52.465
No.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.467
I told them this morning.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.837
Mm. Won't be pleasant,
but we'll get through this,

34:58.087 --> 34:59.839
and we'll all be the better for it.

35:00.089 --> 35:02.508
Truth is, this is the best thing
for the department.

35:02.758 --> 35:05.078
You know, clean it up,
put it behind us.

35:05.328 --> 35:08.231
Everything okay?

35:08.481 --> 35:09.649
What happened to your shoe?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.651
What? I'm sorry?

35:11.901 --> 35:14.195
Your left heel makeslick a c
when you walk.

35:16.639 --> 35:18.491
The tip must have llen off.

35:18.741 --> 35:22.036
When did that happen?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.629
Any idea?

35:23.879 --> 35:25.631
No. Why?

35:25.881 --> 35:28.584
The thing is,

35:28.834 --> 35:30.836
the phone log at the
Silver Saddle Motel

35:31.086 --> 35:35.174
shows the room being resved
to the name of Edward Munte,

35:35.424 --> 35:38.011
about an hour before Captain
Kessel picked the key up.

35:40.137 --> 35:42.140
So I called around hotels and motels.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.267
Turns out Edward Munte's

35:44.517 --> 35:46.561
been reserving rooms
all over town for a while.

35:48.704 --> 35:51.424
The calls don't come
from Kessel's phone.

35:51.674 --> 35:54.444
They come from
an anonymous VoIP account.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.070
It was billed to a credit card.

35:57.126 --> 35:58.573
Yours.

36:06.747 --> 36:09.575
How long have you known Kessel?

36:11.294 --> 36:13.880
Before you shot him in the head?

36:15.509 --> 36:16.466
Years.

36:18.033 --> 36:20.019
20 years.

36:20.269 --> 36:22.347
I've taken a bullet for you

36:22.597 --> 36:24.958
or your family.

36:25.208 --> 36:27.101
And I'm struggling

36:27.351 --> 36:33.232
to understand how you could
so easily destroy mine.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.570
I just want to know why.

36:39.021 --> 36:40.239
Mike?

36:40.489 --> 36:44.077
I want to hear it from your mouth.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.536
I'm sorry, Michael.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.661
You're sorry?!

36:48.097 --> 36:49.707
Mike, open this damn door!

36:51.166 --> 36:52.918
I shouldn't let you leave this room.

36:53.168 --> 36:54.187
Mike!

36:54.437 --> 36:55.521
Nothing that happens to you

36:55.771 --> 36:57.006
when you walk out this door

36:57.256 --> 36:58.633
can ever be bad enough for me.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.176
Mike!

37:00.426 --> 37:03.054
Mike, open the damn door!

37:03.304 --> 37:04.597
Mike, open the damn door now.

37:30.539 --> 37:34.001
Captain Harper, this
is Detectives James

37:34.251 --> 37:35.294
and Bushwick from Internal Affairs.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.922
They're going to need
to ask you some questions.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.342
You need to come with us.

37:55.088 --> 37:56.607
Go home.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.734
I'm fine.

37:58.984 --> 38:00.086
I didn't say you weren't.

38:00.336 --> 38:02.088
I said go home.
Be with your boy.

38:02.338 --> 38:04.532
I'll call you
as soon as they finish with her.

38:08.844 --> 38:09.729
Mike...

38:11.122 --> 38:14.917
I have a lot questions
about the last couple of days.

38:15.167 --> 38:18.085
Things I'm going to need
your help to understand.

38:26.562 --> 38:29.390
<i>I can't tell you
how many cases I've closed.</i>

38:29.640 --> 38:30.849
You know, most of the time

38:31.099 --> 38:32.935
I think it's the ex-boyfriend,
it is the ex-boyfriend.

38:33.185 --> 38:36.189
Sometimes it's almost miraculous
how you untangle something,

38:36.439 --> 38:38.524
but neither way, you feel...

38:38.774 --> 38:40.902
I don't know, not satisfaction.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.196
Closure, I guess.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.947
And this doesn't feel that way?

38:46.435 --> 38:47.252
No.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.036
How does it feel?

38:50.286 --> 38:51.579
Like it doesn't matter.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.667
I want a time machine.

38:58.339 --> 39:01.981
As much as we... we often wish
that life were otherwise,

39:02.231 --> 39:04.050
it only moves in one direction.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.719
And the good news is,

39:06.969 --> 39:10.723
you finally realize
that this is life.

39:10.973 --> 39:15.060
It's not about imaginary
partners in penguin suits.

39:15.310 --> 39:16.646
You're letting yourself

39:16.896 --> 39:20.333
see this other world for the
dream that it's always been.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.602
And that is an enormous step

39:22.852 --> 39:26.531
towards the very closure
that you're talking about.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.699
No, I don't want closure
with my family.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.476
I believe that you're fine

39:30.726 --> 39:34.330
that allowing yourself to
invest fully in one real life

39:34.580 --> 39:37.783
is ultimately going to
be a richer experience

39:38.033 --> 39:39.877
than dividing yourself between two.

39:41.871 --> 39:45.258
What if I just had a dream?

39:47.476 --> 39:49.303
I don't follow.

39:49.553 --> 39:53.724
I mean, everything else feels
real to me right here and there.

39:54.543 --> 39:56.352
Everything obeys all the laws

39:56.602 --> 39:57.979
of physics, logic, and...

39:58.229 --> 40:02.775
Why can't I just... have had...
a normal dream?

40:03.025 --> 40:04.310
Are you saying that...

40:04.560 --> 40:08.447
that you were having a dream
while you were dreaming?

40:10.950 --> 40:14.453
Detective, the last time
that you truly came face-to-face

40:14.703 --> 40:16.656
with the fact that
you had lost your wife,

40:16.906 --> 40:19.166
it split your reality in two.

40:19.416 --> 40:23.713
And now you're on the
verge of remedying that.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.882
The world with Hannah is a dream.

40:27.132 --> 40:28.334
And you saw that.

40:28.584 --> 40:29.844
You know that.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.762
Hannah is gone.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.274
And it's time to come back
to living in one world

40:35.524 --> 40:37.977
and not run off seeking a third.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.194
I'm not seeking anything.
I'm just saying, wh-who...

40:41.063 --> 40:42.398
Who knows the rules?
Who's to say?

40:42.648 --> 40:44.717
Help me to understand this.

40:44.967 --> 40:49.689
When you go home tonight, go to bed,

40:49.939 --> 40:51.574
what do you expect to see?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.492
I don't know.

40:55.277 --> 40:56.962
And here I was thinking that...

40:57.212 --> 41:00.124
that we had taken
a giant step forward.

41:00.374 --> 41:01.917
Detective,

41:02.167 --> 41:04.837
I'm afraid it's just turtles
all the way down.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.057
If you could...

41:19.502 --> 41:21.395
Doctor?

42:56.615 --> 42:57.742
Morning.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.494
I was beginning to think
you'd never get up.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.042
What... what time is it?

43:07.292 --> 43:08.160
8:30.

43:08.410 --> 43:09.712
You gonna drive me?

43:11.103 --> 43:12.423
What?

43:12.673 --> 43:15.885
Registration's at 9:00.

43:17.302 --> 43:19.138
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I was just...

43:19.388 --> 43:21.432
Look at this. He lives.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.476
Hey, Rex, could you grab me a water?

43:23.726 --> 43:24.959
Yep.

43:27.896 --> 43:28.848
Dad?

43:29.098 --> 43:30.733
Michael?

43:34.653 --> 43:36.537
You okay?

43:39.675 --> 43:43.144
Yeah... I'm good.

43:48.416 --> 43:49.984
I'm perfect.
