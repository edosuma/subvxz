00:59.451 --> 01:01.552
Come on, man.

01:01.654 --> 01:04.453
Issa. Hey, we gotta get a new couch.

01:04.557 --> 01:06.757
Yeah, I know.

01:10.062 --> 01:12.095
Damn, you look good.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.731
- All sweaty and stuff.
- Yeah?

01:14.833 --> 01:16.633
Why don't you come look good in here?

01:16.735 --> 01:19.570
Oh, okay. Yeah, cool.

01:27.846 --> 01:30.280
- Mm. Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.920
Mm, fuck! Oh, my God, this is hot!

01:37.022 --> 01:38.667
Is this the temperature
you normally keep it at?

01:38.691 --> 01:40.624
- Yeah...
- This is way too hot.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.627
Okay, okay. Stand here and put
it the temperature you want it.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.195
Okay, all right. Let me get that.

01:45.297 --> 01:48.265
Cool. Okay, but now I'm
not getting any water.

01:48.367 --> 01:51.101
- Fine, stand here and I'll move here.
- Okay.

01:52.605 --> 01:55.741
Oh, no, watch out! That's my
shampoo. And it's slippery there.

01:55.766 --> 01:57.419
My dad had a friend who
got paralyzed like this.

01:57.443 --> 01:59.120
Lawrence, are you really
thinking about your dad right now?

01:59.144 --> 02:01.278
No! I'm thinking about
his paralyzed friend.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.615
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

02:04.717 --> 02:07.217
All right. Oh! No!

02:16.462 --> 02:18.295
- Should we try spooning?
- Stop!

02:18.397 --> 02:20.397
Gross! I love you, but gross.

02:20.499 --> 02:21.898
Whatever.

02:22.001 --> 02:24.067
- Stay with it.
- I kind of like this one.

02:24.169 --> 02:25.802
- I love this one.
- Yeah?

02:25.904 --> 02:28.772
And I can watch you do
work while I sit back.

02:28.874 --> 02:30.374
Huh? Huh?

02:30.476 --> 02:32.042
All right.

02:32.144 --> 02:34.044
- What do you think?
- I think I want it.

02:34.146 --> 02:35.912
- And I think we should get it.
- Yeah?

02:36.015 --> 02:38.048
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.983
You don't need the pump, Frank.

02:40.085 --> 02:41.685
Lotion already comes in a pump.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.487
You're gonna transfer all that lotion

02:43.589 --> 02:44.909
from the pump it already comes in

02:44.990 --> 02:46.723
to this new pump for no reason?

02:46.825 --> 02:48.859
I hate you.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.631
Is that what I sound like?

02:54.733 --> 02:56.500
- I'm just trying to tell you.
- Stop.

02:56.602 --> 02:58.735
- Put the pump down! Put it down!
- They'll hear you.

02:58.837 --> 03:01.071
- She hates him.
- She...

03:01.173 --> 03:03.040
Is that what we sounded
like at Rite Aid?

03:03.142 --> 03:05.842
No! We were arguing
about travel panties.

03:05.944 --> 03:07.411
Duh.

03:07.513 --> 03:10.080
- Well, just so you know...
- Hmm?

03:10.182 --> 03:12.649
I will always...

03:12.751 --> 03:14.718
let you buy a lotion pump.

03:17.389 --> 03:19.567
You know how long I've been
waiting to hear you say that?

03:19.591 --> 03:23.060
Hmm? Come here. Mm-wah.

03:24.096 --> 03:25.696
Hey, Frank was right, though.

03:25.798 --> 03:27.542
I mean, what if you get bulk
lotion? Where's that supposed to go?

03:27.566 --> 03:29.666
- Right? Dude knows what's up.
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.036
I just don't understand
why it's taking you so long

03:33.105 --> 03:34.705
to answer one simple question.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.673
Because it's a tough question.

03:36.775 --> 03:38.642
- You go first.
- Okay.

03:38.744 --> 03:40.544
- TLC, Jodeci...
- Mm-hmm.

03:40.646 --> 03:43.380
702, Dru Hill, and Xscape.

03:43.482 --> 03:45.082
- Xscape?
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.062
- Wow. That first album is a classic.
- Stop it.

03:47.086 --> 03:49.319
- You're stalling again.
- Okay, if I had to choose,

03:49.421 --> 03:51.121
- my top five would be...
- Okay.

03:51.223 --> 03:53.056
112, Blackstreet,

03:53.158 --> 03:56.426
also Jodeci, Boyz II
Men, and Color Me Badd.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.261
Oh, no. Waitress, check, please.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.497
And can you also revoke his
black card while we at it?

04:00.599 --> 04:02.466
"I Wanna Sex You Up" Color Me Badd?

04:02.568 --> 04:06.136
- That's the one.
- Now, that was just bad. Mm-mm.

04:08.607 --> 04:12.576
Yo, I am so glad this hasn't been
a "one and done" type of thing.

04:12.678 --> 04:13.877
What do you mean?

04:13.979 --> 04:15.545
I just haven't met someone in a while

04:15.647 --> 04:18.115
that I actually wanna go
on multiple dates with.

04:19.685 --> 04:22.452
Wow. That makes me happy to hear.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.521
- Yeah.
- Mm.

04:24.623 --> 04:26.490
Oh, how was your work dinner last night?

04:26.592 --> 04:28.737
- You didn't text me when you got home.
- Oh, yeah, my bad.

04:28.761 --> 04:30.761
After I left, I was so
tired, I just crashed.

04:30.863 --> 04:34.397
Oh, okay. Well, you know I just wanted
to know that you got home safely.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.433
That's all.

04:36.535 --> 04:38.502
I appreciate the concern. Thank you.

04:38.604 --> 04:40.570
You are welcome.

04:40.672 --> 04:43.240
You know, it's just the little things.

04:43.342 --> 04:45.842
Yeah.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.583
So I was like, "The fact that the client

04:53.685 --> 04:56.753
"imposed this operational
status with uniformity

04:56.855 --> 04:58.288
"does not make it liable.

04:58.390 --> 05:01.792
"There is a substantial amount
of case law that supports..."

05:01.894 --> 05:04.316
Black people stay loud.

05:04.341 --> 05:06.187
They ain't know what
to do with your girl!

05:06.265 --> 05:09.199
Rasheeda was a thoughter.
They ain't ready.

05:09.301 --> 05:10.901
They ain't ready.

05:17.709 --> 05:19.943
Oh, hi. Hey, can I help you?

05:20.045 --> 05:22.379
Yeah, I just wanted
to talk to, uh, Issa.

05:22.481 --> 05:24.381
Oh, hi. I'm Frieda. I'm her partner.

05:24.483 --> 05:26.161
- Daniel. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:26.185 --> 05:28.318
- What do you do?
- I'm in music.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.754
Oh, my God, I love music! Cool!

05:30.856 --> 05:33.323
Yeah, Issa's right over
there, yeah. Do you see her?

05:33.425 --> 05:35.292
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Issa, your friend is here.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.675
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

05:37.919 --> 05:38.951
Hey.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.661
What are you doing here?

05:42.686 --> 05:44.078
Look, I'm sorry for coming to your job.

05:44.102 --> 05:46.169
Um, I was in the neighborhood

05:46.271 --> 05:49.272
and, uh... can... can we talk?

05:49.374 --> 05:51.675
- Can we...?
- Uh, sure.

06:02.354 --> 06:04.921
Iss, I'm sorry about what
happened in your car that night.

06:05.023 --> 06:08.859
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, I...

06:08.961 --> 06:11.528
That was the first time
that we had hung out

06:11.630 --> 06:12.996
in, like... like, five years.

06:13.098 --> 06:16.766
I... I just should've
handled it differently.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.205
Yeah, well, I was going
through a lot that night, so...

06:22.307 --> 06:24.241
Still, though, you know, we go back.

06:24.343 --> 06:28.044
I just... I don't want
things to be off between us.

06:29.581 --> 06:31.381
Well, me neither.

06:31.483 --> 06:34.184
You know, maybe I should've
answered your calls

06:34.286 --> 06:36.152
and returned your texts.

06:36.255 --> 06:38.255
It's all good.

06:38.357 --> 06:43.260
So, just... so, how you been?

06:43.362 --> 06:44.961
I'm good.

06:45.063 --> 06:47.497
Work is cool.

06:47.599 --> 06:49.633
Oh, and I'm back with my boyfriend.

06:49.735 --> 06:51.067
We had broken up that night,

06:51.169 --> 06:53.336
but, you know, uh, we made up.

06:53.438 --> 06:57.540
Oh, um, that's great.

06:57.643 --> 07:00.443
So, what you're saying is
my timing is perfect, right?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.612
So perfect.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.914
Yeah.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.750
Well, I know you got
a lot of work to do.

07:06.852 --> 07:09.419
- It was... it was good to see you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:09.521 --> 07:11.655
It was great seeing you, too.

07:11.757 --> 07:12.822
Oh.

07:17.462 --> 07:19.763
Hey, that empanada place,
is it... is it good?

07:19.865 --> 07:22.499
Mm, it has a C rating.

07:22.601 --> 07:24.167
But it is worth it.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.670
Okay.

07:34.646 --> 07:37.881
Bitch, what?! That nigga
came up to your job?

07:37.983 --> 07:40.116
I know! I didn't know
what his ass was gonna do.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.818
Well, what did he say? What did he want?

07:41.853 --> 07:44.854
He just wanted to apologize
for what went down.

07:44.957 --> 07:46.723
It was crazy!

07:46.825 --> 07:48.858
Wait, that's it?

07:48.961 --> 07:51.506
That's why I told everyone I needed
the conference room for an hour?

07:51.530 --> 07:54.130
No, girl. That's how
this shit always happens.

07:54.232 --> 07:56.700
Okay? Just when things are
going good in your relationship,

07:56.802 --> 07:59.135
exes always have a way of
popping the fuck back up.

07:59.237 --> 08:02.572
Okay, it's like Lawrence and I just
leveled up, like, "bloop-bloop,"

08:02.674 --> 08:03.873
and then here comes Daniel.

08:03.976 --> 08:05.296
That nigga showing up to your job

08:05.344 --> 08:06.544
is kind of stalkerish, though.

08:06.645 --> 08:08.945
Right?! It's, like, back up!

08:09.047 --> 08:10.580
Stop smiling at me,

08:10.682 --> 08:13.016
asking me about empanadas and shit.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.854
- He did look good, though.
- He did?

08:17.956 --> 08:20.201
No, I mean, but he always looks
good. He's fine or whatever.

08:20.225 --> 08:22.070
He just, like, works out
and he's really... he's tall.

08:22.094 --> 08:23.094
- Issa.
- What?

08:23.195 --> 08:25.862
Bitch, you just said you and
Lawrence "bloop-blooped" or whatever.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.484
You know Daniel is your Achilles dick.

08:27.532 --> 08:28.765
No, okay?

08:28.867 --> 08:30.667
I told him I'm back with Lawrence,

08:30.769 --> 08:32.068
and we're good.

08:32.169 --> 08:34.147
It's over. I handled it.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.706
Anyway, you all set
to come to Career Day?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.708
- The kids are excited.
- Shit.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.812
Girl, I forgot. And work
is piling up right now.

08:42.914 --> 08:46.383
- Um, can I let you know?
- I hate you so much.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.652
- Black people stay trifling.
- Don't they, though?

08:52.424 --> 08:54.858
So, were you talking to Dr. Bae?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.694
Who, Michael? No, that's over.

08:57.796 --> 09:00.697
Wait, what? I thought he
gave you marriage eyes.

09:00.799 --> 09:02.632
Apparently, those were
just his regular eyes.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.267
I just wish he would've given me

09:04.369 --> 09:05.935
some sort of explanation, you know?

09:06.038 --> 09:09.139
Instead, he's all, "I'm
too busy to date right now."

09:09.241 --> 09:10.673
Really?

09:10.776 --> 09:12.576
Why would you go on
three dates with me, then?

09:12.677 --> 09:15.111
Exactly. Asshole.

09:15.213 --> 09:18.048
It's fine, though. I already have
another League date for tonight.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.616
Go, Molls!

09:19.718 --> 09:21.985
- Yes!
- Hey, Molly.

09:22.087 --> 09:23.486
- Diane.
- Hi.

09:23.588 --> 09:26.823
Diane, Gabe wanted to talk
to you about the Emerson case.

09:26.925 --> 09:28.458
But I'm not on that case.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.861
Oh, well, then you
better go tell him that.

09:39.671 --> 09:42.372
Don't you just love the
new summer associate class?

09:42.474 --> 09:45.642
Oh, yeah. I better watch out or one
of them's gonna try and take my job.

09:49.581 --> 09:53.583
Yeah. And Rasheeda is really funny.

09:54.986 --> 09:57.353
Yeah, she's hysterical.

09:57.456 --> 10:00.423
But, uh, I don't know.

10:00.525 --> 10:02.559
A... a few of the other partners and I

10:02.661 --> 10:06.129
have noticed that she's
been a little, you know...

10:06.231 --> 10:09.532
She's not quite adjusting
to the culture here

10:09.634 --> 10:11.534
like some of her fellow interns.

10:11.636 --> 10:12.735
Ah.

10:12.838 --> 10:15.772
And we just feel that it would be great

10:15.874 --> 10:18.174
for you to have a chat with her,

10:18.276 --> 10:19.943
because it wasn't so long ago

10:20.045 --> 10:22.178
that you were a summer associate.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.747
Mm.

10:56.348 --> 10:59.182
Well, the more applications you
launch, the more physical RAM you use,

10:59.284 --> 11:02.252
so you wanna make sure and
shut it down from the dock.

11:02.354 --> 11:03.953
Just saves up some space.

11:04.055 --> 11:05.955
- I'll do that next time. Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:06.057 --> 11:08.658
- Hey, great job there.
- Thanks.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.005
You know, most people think you
can shut down from the window,

11:11.029 --> 11:12.462
but it just takes...

11:12.564 --> 11:13.730
So, Todd is out sick.

11:13.832 --> 11:15.665
He's got adult chickenpox, whatever,

11:15.734 --> 11:18.412
so we're gonna need you to cover
Connected Home & Housewares for a week.

11:18.436 --> 11:20.436
Specifically, washers and dryers.

11:20.539 --> 11:22.672
Oh, I don't know anything
about washers and dryers.

11:22.774 --> 11:25.101
Oh, that's okay. You're
smart; you'll catch on.

11:25.877 --> 11:27.243
Right, but, um,

11:27.345 --> 11:28.945
I was hired because I know computers.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.581
Have you been back there? Those
dryers are full of computers.

11:31.683 --> 11:33.349
You'll crush it.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.689
Can we get some assistance
in Washers and Dryers?

11:46.231 --> 11:47.830
Do you wanna confirm the guests

11:47.933 --> 11:49.532
and I'll work out the schedule?

11:49.634 --> 11:51.100
Sure. But first,

11:51.203 --> 11:53.536
a toast to finally hanging out.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.439
I mean, you know, who knows?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.942
Maybe one day, we can
go out like real friends.

12:02.614 --> 12:05.481
So, I'm thinking 20
minutes for each speaker.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.650
- Okay.
- Let the kids Q & A for 10,

12:07.752 --> 12:09.272
and then we can rotate each speaker...

12:09.354 --> 12:11.654
Oh, shit! Shit.

12:11.756 --> 12:14.524
Patricia never confirmed
with her guy, the painter,

12:14.626 --> 12:15.925
and now she says he can't come.

12:15.994 --> 12:18.161
I have an opinion on that.

12:18.263 --> 12:20.129
You know, she was my partner last year

12:20.232 --> 12:23.666
and she's totally nice, but she
does this kind of thing all the time.

12:23.768 --> 12:25.501
She's so nice, though.

12:25.604 --> 12:27.403
Oh, my God.

12:27.505 --> 12:30.139
- Do you hate Patricia?
- I never said that.

12:30.242 --> 12:31.874
No, I never said that. She's great.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.142
Is she?

12:34.980 --> 12:36.079
I hate her so much.

12:36.181 --> 12:37.814
- She's the worst!
- The worst!

12:37.916 --> 12:40.950
The way she just rolls her eyes
when you ask her to do anything.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.219
And she takes a 30-minute
break after her lunch break.

12:43.321 --> 12:44.899
It's, like, that's
what your lunch is for.

12:44.923 --> 12:46.990
I think she walks to Ralph's to poop.

12:53.298 --> 12:56.933
Ugh, Patricia's guy was the only one
we had who did anything in the arts.

12:57.035 --> 12:59.636
We need someone creative.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.604
Wait, hey, what about
your friend Daniel?

13:01.706 --> 13:05.441
- Huh? Why... why him?
- Well, he said he worked in music.

13:05.543 --> 13:08.044
Yeah, but... pfft, ah.

13:08.146 --> 13:09.679
- Mm.
- Could you ask him?

13:11.283 --> 13:13.783
I mean, I... I guess I could.

13:13.885 --> 13:15.685
Uh, he's probably busy.

13:17.055 --> 13:18.955
But if... but if you want me to...

13:19.057 --> 13:20.290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:20.392 --> 13:22.025
Okay. Great.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.635
_

13:45.450 --> 13:48.751
So, how long were you waiting
to get into The League?

13:48.853 --> 13:51.554
- Just a few months.
- Oh, me, too.

13:52.824 --> 13:55.725
And, uh, so, what firm are you at again?

13:55.827 --> 13:57.694
I'm at Merrill, Johnson, and Schwartz.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.363
Okay. I've come up
against you guys before.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.099
Yeah, pretty solid firm.

14:03.201 --> 14:04.534
I guess.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.302
Why? What happened?

14:06.404 --> 14:08.638
It's just some work drama.

14:08.740 --> 14:11.874
One of the partners asked me to
talk to the other black girl at work.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.976
They thought she was
being a little extra.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.212
Was she, though?

14:16.314 --> 14:19.515
I mean, she was, but I'm
not the black translator

14:19.617 --> 14:21.996
here to tell the colored folks
what "massa" think they done wrong.

14:22.020 --> 14:25.221
- Like I'm some "House Molly."
- Like you Sam Jackson in "Django."

14:25.323 --> 14:27.023
Right?! I'm Django!

14:27.125 --> 14:28.825
It's hard being Django.

14:28.927 --> 14:31.761
I mean, stuff like that happens
to me all the time at work.

14:31.863 --> 14:33.963
- Yeah?
- One of the partners at my firm

14:34.065 --> 14:35.965
tries to fist bump
me every time we talk.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.601
- Shut up.
- This nigga even did it in court once.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.136
No, stop it.

14:40.238 --> 14:43.539
But, no, you can never let those
white people stress you out.

14:45.744 --> 14:47.777
I'm sorry. I was being so negative.

14:47.879 --> 14:49.312
Don't be.

14:49.414 --> 14:50.613
Come on.

15:47.305 --> 15:49.238
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:50.308 --> 15:52.175
Mm, I know this is weird,

15:52.277 --> 15:54.143
but I was too scared
to eat on the new couch.

15:55.814 --> 15:58.247
- How was work?
- It's a job.

15:58.349 --> 16:01.350
Damn, Lawrence. That's
like how prostitutes say it.

16:01.453 --> 16:03.152
It's a job.

16:06.057 --> 16:08.024
Mm, did you eat at work?

16:08.126 --> 16:10.526
Oh, yeah. Frieda just ordered pizza.

16:10.628 --> 16:12.495
- Pow!
- Thank you.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.096
Mm-hmm.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.101
So, you're good for Career Day?

16:20.705 --> 16:23.005
Yeah. We are all set.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.374
- Is this from Pie Hole?
- Yep.

16:25.477 --> 16:28.611
- Mm.
- It was the last day for pumpkin.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.947
- You know my heart.
- I know your heart.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.523
Hey, Hannah. Your assistant
said this was a good time?

16:40.625 --> 16:44.026
Oh, uh, of course. Come on in.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.898
I just wanted to discuss
the Rasheeda situation.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.199
It's not a situation.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.002
It sounds big. It's... it's a chat.

16:53.104 --> 16:55.838
Right. And it means the world to me

16:55.940 --> 16:58.274
that you would entrust me to
have this chat with Rasheeda.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.376
- Great!
- But as you said,

17:00.478 --> 17:03.246
it hasn't been that long
since I was a summer associate,

17:03.348 --> 17:06.715
so I'm worried that it may
not bear the same weight

17:06.818 --> 17:08.984
coming from me as it would from you.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.386
Oh.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.888
I just think that it
would be much better

17:12.991 --> 17:14.624
for you to have the
conversation with her

17:14.726 --> 17:16.959
so that you can communicate
everything you wanna say

17:17.060 --> 17:19.127
as a partner.

17:19.230 --> 17:22.231
I would just hate for anything
to get lost in translation.

17:23.568 --> 17:24.901
I see what you mean.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.136
We'll handle it, then, Molly.

17:27.238 --> 17:29.372
- Great. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:41.119 --> 17:43.986
Well, look who on
break from they new job.

17:44.088 --> 17:47.490
- What you got, some noodles?
- Yep.

17:47.592 --> 17:50.192
I'm trying to do this
whole eating healthy thing,

17:50.295 --> 17:53.696
so I made me some brown rice,

17:53.798 --> 17:57.466
some kale, some chicken
breast, and sweet potatoes.

17:57.569 --> 18:00.069
My girlfriend loves kale,

18:00.171 --> 18:01.537
but I don't get it.

18:01.639 --> 18:03.239
Yeah, me neither.

18:03.341 --> 18:07.843
Kale tastes like foot juice, but
they say it's good for you, so...

18:09.180 --> 18:13.282
Get my hot sauce, mix this togeth...

18:13.384 --> 18:15.918
Um, this... this look ghetto, huh?

18:16.020 --> 18:19.789
Hey, if Beyoncé can do it, so can I.

18:19.891 --> 18:24.126
♪ I woke up like this. ♪

18:25.296 --> 18:27.964
I don't know why I just sang that, so...

What you reading?

18:29.767 --> 18:32.935
Uh, just going over my
Best Buy benefits package.

18:33.037 --> 18:34.882
I mean, I do hear they
have good benefits, though.

18:34.906 --> 18:38.908
They match your 401k
after what, five years?

18:39.010 --> 18:40.242
That's so bomb.

18:40.345 --> 18:42.845
Yeah, I guess.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.617
Just, this job was
supposed to be temporary,

18:47.719 --> 18:50.353
and it's kind of feeling
like it might not be.

18:50.455 --> 18:54.156
I mean, I don't know. I
just saw myself doing more.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.658
Like what?

18:58.196 --> 19:00.496
I had this app that I
was trying to get going,

19:00.598 --> 19:03.866
- but who knows now?
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.868
A for real app?

19:05.970 --> 19:08.037
You need to still do that.

19:08.139 --> 19:09.572
You gotta stay hustling.

19:09.674 --> 19:11.807
Like, I've been a bank
teller for a few years,

19:11.909 --> 19:14.477
but I'm not trying to just
be no bank teller forever.

19:14.579 --> 19:16.612
I wanna be a bank manager.

19:16.714 --> 19:19.749
That's why I'm taking
night classes at El Camino,

19:19.851 --> 19:22.952
so I can learn about stocks
and bonds and all of that.

19:24.322 --> 19:27.123
- I feel you.
- Yeah.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.458
Man, give me some of this.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.394
Why does this make
everything taste better?

19:31.496 --> 19:33.629
- 'Cause I think it got drugs in it.
- Probably.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.802
Hey, Issa. I can make it
to Career Day after all.

19:39.904 --> 19:43.072
I'm on my way and I got gavel
cookies for the kids or just for us.

19:43.174 --> 19:45.441
I'll see you soon. Bye!

20:24.115 --> 20:26.382
Okay.

20:26.484 --> 20:28.017
Okay, okay.

20:28.119 --> 20:29.418
- Hey.
- Yeah.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.153

Ooh!

20:44.635 --> 20:46.202
- What?
- Wow!

20:46.304 --> 20:48.449
This is exactly what it's like
when I work in the studio with Cozz.

20:48.473 --> 20:50.506
Just beats all day, he freestyles,

he writes, and then
we find something hot.

Hey, yo, my older
brother's friends with Cozz.

friends with no rappers.

Guys, let's be respectful
of Mr. King, okay?

21:01.486 --> 21:03.853
So any of y'all wanna add
something to this beat?

21:03.955 --> 21:05.788
Who rhymes?

21:06.858 --> 21:09.125
Yo! I can freestyle.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.993

- All right.

Okay, I see you.

Nah, but I'm producing a track
real soon for Ty Dolla $ign.

- No.

22:00.711 --> 22:04.713
For real, y'all. Hey, back in the
day, Miss Issa used to rap fire.

- Why are you doing this?
- What am I doing?

22:06.851 --> 22:08.896
In fact, she just killed it
at an open mic a few weeks ago.

- They don't need to know all that.
- Actually,

22:10.721 --> 22:13.689
Miss Issa got me into music
big-time back in high school.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.924
Oh.

22:15.026 --> 22:16.458
She kind of inspired me.

22:16.561 --> 22:18.227
Ooh.

22:18.329 --> 22:20.129
Mm, you got a crush on her.

22:20.231 --> 22:22.031
Ooh!

Yo, your kids are a trip.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.012
I'm sorry. They can be sometimes.

22:37.114 --> 22:38.759
What was it with that girl
with all that attitude?

22:38.783 --> 22:41.383
- Was that Dayniece?
- Yeah, she's so anti!

22:41.485 --> 22:44.486
- Mad anti!
- Right?

22:44.589 --> 22:47.623
No, but it was cool to see
you do your thing today.

22:47.725 --> 22:49.325
Oh, for real?

22:49.427 --> 22:51.794
Yeah! I mean, you've been
into music since I've known you

are living your dream.

Oh.

Shit.

- Oh, okay.

- Have fun in them "skreets."
- You stupid.

23:28.332 --> 23:30.766
What the hell? What are you doing there?

23:30.868 --> 23:33.636
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

23:33.738 --> 23:35.437
But I got a man.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.073
Hmm, and where is he?

23:45.249 --> 23:47.227
Real talk, though.

'Cause I've always
been your "what if" guy.

Like, what if we finally
could give us a shot?

23:59.130 --> 24:01.797
What if we were both
single at the same time?

24:01.899 --> 24:05.401

You right, man.

24:13.144 --> 24:14.944

Dolla $ign about me?

What are you even doing here?

24:40.338 --> 24:41.670
I thought you couldn't make it.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.405
I left you a message that said I could.

24:43.507 --> 24:44.974
And why the fuck is Daniel here?

24:45.076 --> 24:46.709

24:48.546 --> 24:50.112
"Oh, what about your friend Daniel?"

24:50.214 --> 24:52.715
And I was like, "Oh, maybe."

24:52.817 --> 24:54.216
And then he came.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.185
And what about your man?

24:56.287 --> 24:59.888
We needed someone who was in the arts!

24:59.991 --> 25:01.957
Okay.

25:03.494 --> 25:05.494
Daniel knows I'm with Lawrence.

25:06.056 --> 25:07.783
Do you?

25:11.862 --> 25:13.412
Thanks for coming, though, girl.

25:13.437 --> 25:15.738
I appreciate you.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.560
I'll go get the rest of the stuff
and I'll meet you at the van?

25:26.584 --> 25:27.950
Sounds good.

25:28.052 --> 25:30.352
Check it out!
