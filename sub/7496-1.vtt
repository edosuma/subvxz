01:05.360 --> 01:07.555
Santiago.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.710
Get your things.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.794
Now.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.112
Now.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.478
Quickly.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.151
What are you waiting for?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.719
Halt.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.430
Remain where you are.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.111
This is the United States border patrol.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.555
Remain where you are.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.872
Remain where you are.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.594
Santiago.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.432
Leave the ball.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.990
Leave the stupid ball. Come on.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.992
This is the United States border patrol.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.789
Los Angeles. Ten years later

03:11.480 --> 03:13.311
Santiago.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.879
Stop goofing off.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.037
Load up the truck.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.156
Right now.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.871
He's so hot.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.070
Santiago. Where have you been?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.953
We're already one down.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.189
Only one?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.793
How's the diet going?

04:16.880 --> 04:18.074
What are you doing?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.639
I don't want anybody hurt.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.551
No shin pads. No game. Get off.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.912
See you.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.351
Hey.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.308
How did you do? You play well?

05:50.800 --> 05:54.793
Well. We won 4-2. Scored a couple.
Should have got another one.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.359
In Spanish.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.158
What's the deal with Dad?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.629
He wants to buy a truck of his own.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.156
Why?

06:02.240 --> 06:05.073
So you can work for yourselves.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.355
Munez and son. Eh?

06:07.440 --> 06:09.874
That's what he wants for us?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.076
- There's always plan B.
- Which one is that?

06:12.160 --> 06:15.038
The American Dream.
We win the lottery.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.949
What happened?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.393
He wants too much.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.711
Too bad.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.474
You have to eat something.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.390
Hey.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.238
Hey. Boss. I've been a busboy now
for six months. Why can't I be a waiter?

06:40.320 --> 06:43.073
This Chinese restaurant.
You're not Chinese.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.515
So? This is America.
You're American. I'm American.

06:45.600 --> 06:49.149
- You have green card?
- If I had one. Could I be a waiter?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.231
No. You're not Chinese.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.040
Tommy. Hold your position.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.475
Tommy. You're supposed
to be on the wing.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.755
It's not the Cup Final.
He's seven years old.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.558
You're never too young. Val.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.154
To be honest. I don't think
Tom's that into soccer.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.151
That's b... Oh.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.195
Go.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.113
- Hey. Watch out.
- Go on. Tom.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.670
Thanks.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.840
- He's quite a player.
- Yes. He is.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.113
- Did you teach him to do that?
- God taught him.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.352
He doesn't look right.
His balance is all wrong.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.669
Doesn't look up enough.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.398
Doesn't lift his legs high enough.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.357
That's what all the other teams think.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.320
Then that happens.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.436
Well played. Son.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.556
Do you ever play professional?

08:58.640 --> 09:04.636
Well... pro teams go for college kids and...
none of us went to college.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.792
- When's your next game?
- Saturday.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.759
There's someone I bumped into
on the plane on the way over here.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.673
I want him to see you play.
He's a sports agent.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.672
I'm serious. I think you're worth it. Son.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.910
Listen. No offence.
But I need to get to work.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.389
I used to play a bit myself.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.517
- Yeah? Where?
- England.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.797
I was a scout too.
I know what I'm talking about.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.599
- England?
- What's your name. Son?

09:31.680 --> 09:34.592
- Santiago Munez.
- Glen Foy.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.719
I'll see you Saturday. Santiago.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.391
Man.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.112
Movie stars have agents.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.794
What's an agent
supposed to do with you?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.914
Do you know something?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.150
Your boy's really good.
He could be a star.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.470
Don't you get it?

10:07.560 --> 10:10.154
There are two types of people
in this world.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.476
Those that live in big houses

10:12.560 --> 10:14.551
and people like us.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.030
Who cut their lawns
and wash their cars.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.955
That could change
if I become a professional player.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.154
What are you saying?

10:24.240 --> 10:26.959
You play in a park with a bunch of guys

10:27.040 --> 10:28.598
who work in a car wash.

10:28.680 --> 10:36.189
I don't know. Meet this guy and
everything could change. For the better.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.353
I know how to make things better.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.115
We buy a truck.
We make our own business.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.875
The rest is rubbish.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.510
Another beer.

10:55.800 --> 11:01.432
Baseball. Tennis. Soccer. Basketball.
All at the touch of a button.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.593
Experience the thrill of the game from
the comfort of your home environment.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.399
- Barry. Is this a good moment?
- No time like the present.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.950
So he's a young Mexican kid
from the barrio.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.157
He dazzled me. I tell you. Barry.
As you know. I don't dazzle easily.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.550
The last time was a young kid
called Jermain Defoe.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.430
- I'd rather not talk about that. Glen.
- So he's playing on Saturday afternoon.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.158
Some college downtown.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.198
Right. Tell me exactly where it is
and I'll be there 110%.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.033
- Glad to hear it.
- Oh. Hello. Now.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.317
Why don't you knock yourself out
and help yourself to finger food?

11:35.400 --> 11:38.312
Probably don't do sashimi in Gateshead.
Do they. Mate?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.595
See you later.
Yes. Bruv.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.989
- Would you like some sashimi?
- I'm in LA.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.708
Whoo. Come on. Santiago.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.191
Come on. Back.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.070
Val. Let me use your phone.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.390
Yo.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.119
Glen. Glen. Mate.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.670
Glen. I'm not a dickhead.
I didn't forget. No.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.799
I'm in a business meeting. Bruv. I'm in
a meeting. I'm in a meeting all morning.

13:01.880 --> 13:07.159
Yeah. Sorry. Listen. Mate. Do us a favour.
Can you send me a tape of your boy?

13:07.240 --> 13:10.038
Glen. Glen. GI...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.471
Pillock.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.030
Goal. Yes.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.669
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.916
Hey. Grandma.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.870
Santiago. Well played. Son. Well done.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.315
Thank you. Thank you.
This is my little brother.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.551
- Hello. How are you? Pleased to meet you.
- And this is my grandma.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.870
- This is my daughter Val.
- Hi.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.871
So you are the agent?

14:05.960 --> 14:08.554
No. No. No. No.
This man arranged for the agent to come.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.191
And he didn't. I'm afraid.
He's... you know. He's too busy.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.158
So he'll come to the next game?

14:16.240 --> 14:18.708
No. No. I'm afraid he can't.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.110
He's flying back to England tomorrow.
So am I.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.351
Look at that.
Maybe the old man is right.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.159
You dare to dream. Get screwed.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.314
Thanks anyway.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.077
- Hello. Who is this?
- This is Glen Foy.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.072
Glen Foy? Do I know you. Mr Foy?

14:56.160 --> 15:00.551
Uh... Well. I was one of your scouts
when you first took over.

15:00.640 --> 15:05.714
You fired me. Actually. Well. You brought in
the new regime. I don't hold it against you.

15:05.800 --> 15:10.396
Oh. You don't? So why are you calling me
at half past three in the morning?

15:10.480 --> 15:13.119
Sorry. I'm in California.

15:14.080 --> 15:19.200
I've just seen a young player.
I think he's a remarkable talent.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.555
- Who does he play for?
- Oh. Just local league. Kickabout stuff.

15:25.640 --> 15:30.589
The point is. I'm on a plane home tomorrow
and I want you to make me a promise.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.798
If he turns up on your doorstep.
Will you see him?

15:34.880 --> 15:38.714
- You want me to promise you this. Right?
- Aye.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.873
Just give him a run out.
That's all I'm asking.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.235
If I say yes. Can I go back to sleep?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.950
Yes. Mr Dornhelm.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.951
Then yes. Mr Foy.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.516
- Santiago.
- Hey.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.078
- How are you doing?
- Fine. Thank you. Why are you here?

16:07.160 --> 16:09.833
Your coach told me where to find you.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.951
Who's this?

16:12.040 --> 16:14.395
The man from England
who watched me play football.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.268
If you get yourself to England.
Newcastle United will give you a trial.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.316
Newcastle United?

16:20.400 --> 16:23.358
- That's a big club.
- A very big club.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.749
What is this bullshit?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.871
You think you are going to
play football in England?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.995
He thinks I'm good enough.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.038
Why you fill him with ideas like this?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.509
Who the hell do you think you are?

16:38.600 --> 16:43.754
And you. Why don't you keep your feet on
the ground instead of your head in the sky?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.348
It's a big thing you ask. Senor.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.592
He's supposed to fly halfway
across the world on something you say?

16:56.680 --> 17:01.754
The manager's made me a promise.
He'll give him a trial. The rest is up to him.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.637
- Look in my eyes and answer me this.
- Grandma.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.439
Can Santi make it as a professional?

17:07.520 --> 17:09.795
Aye. I believe he can.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.839
Dad. We've gotta go. If the freeway's busy.
You're gonna miss your flight.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.230
Here's my card.
It's all my numbers.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.310
Think about it. Give me a ring.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.391
It's good to meet you.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.271
Good to see you.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.835
You got enough?

17:59.840 --> 18:03.879
- Enough what?
- Everyone knows the money's in the boot.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.190
So are you going?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.590
- Grandma thinks I should.
- What does Dad think?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.750
I haven't asked him.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.751
How far away is England?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.391
Right now?

18:19.760 --> 18:22.115
400 bucks too far.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.191
Go back to sleep.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.395
Now.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.353
There?

19:11.560 --> 19:13.471
Thanks.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.956
How could you do this. Dad?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.031
I paid 4500 for the truck.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.350
I took 1200 of yours.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.635
But I'm giving you half the business.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.679
That's a good deal.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.909
You stole that money.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.353
Stay out of this. Mother.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.271
You knew what it was for.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.557
- Two more weeks and I have enough.
- For what?

19:53.640 --> 19:55.676
To chase a stupid dream?

19:56.640 --> 20:01.031
Big-time ballplayer in England.
Come on. It's bullshit.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.718
And when you fail. How are you
gonna come back with no papers?

20:04.800 --> 20:08.554
One chance. And you think I should
just give it up for what you do?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.598
What I do is take care of my family.

20:11.680 --> 20:16.390
In Mexico. I work construction.
At night. I clean up in a brothel.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.040
But I save enough to bring us to America.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.396
And when your mother walk out on us...
No. When she walk out.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.869
- I hold this family together.
- Leave her out of this.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.873
I make enough for this house
and now we have our own business.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.430
That's how things get better.
That's how you measure a man's life.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.954
It's your life.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.154
Not mine.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.319
Gavin.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.231
Gavin. Gavin.

21:09.240 --> 21:13.995
Ladies and gentlemen.
This is a very good day for the club.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.196
Gavin is a very gifted player

21:16.280 --> 21:20.398
and should fit in very well
with our set-up here at St James' Park.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.951
I'm very pleased to present him... with this.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.271
Winning the league's out of sight. Erik.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.716
What are your realistic goals
for the rest of the season?

21:36.800 --> 21:41.430
Finishing in the first four and qualifying for
Europe. It's essential for a club like this.

21:41.520 --> 21:46.196
To do that. You're gonna have to take
maximum points from your next games.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.317
Look. The club has had
some problems lately. Yeah.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.311
But...

21:51.960 --> 21:54.474
I'm here now. Yeah.

21:55.360 --> 21:59.911
And I'm not in it for fame
or money or anything like that.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.355
I like to win matches.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.398
So maximum points
shouldn't be a problem.

22:05.480 --> 22:06.993
Eh. Boss?

22:44.120 --> 22:45.599
Where's your father?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.955
He's gone to get a part for the truck.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.439
Good.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.476
He doesn't have to hear this.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.679
Train ticket to San Diego.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.159
Bus ticket to Mexico City.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.318
Mexico City?

23:05.400 --> 23:06.799
Yes.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.872
You can't fly to London
from Los Angeles.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.795
You're illegal.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.197
This is your ticket.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.317
It's dated one week from now.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.312
Grandma. How did you pay for this?

23:22.600 --> 23:26.832
I've worked all my life.
I have savings.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.398
What did you sell?

23:29.640 --> 23:30.550
What did you hock?

23:33.360 --> 23:36.352
Old things. From the past.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.874
So now do I get a room to myself?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.678
Come here.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.954
Who's gonna help with your homework?
You won't do it.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.712
He'll do it.

23:47.800 --> 23:52.032
Take a shower before you leave.
You smell real bad.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.998
- Am I leaving tonight?
- Sure.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.116
Before your father gets home.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.318
When your mother walked out on us.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.996
I promised God I'd do everything
to help you boys follow your dreams.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.113
You deserve this chance. Santiago.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.111
Take it.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.470
Passengers making
connecting flights from Mexico

24:46.560 --> 24:49.916
should proceed to gate 14.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.958
- Purpose of your visit?
- Excuse me?

24:53.040 --> 24:56.396
- Business or pleasure?
- Business.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.276
I play... I play soccer... football.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.591
I hope to. For Newcastle United.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.990
One moment.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.758
This young man wants to play
for your team. Mr Henderson.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.831
Newcastle?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.319
Yes. Sir.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.472
Need all the help we can get.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.671
Glen. Phone.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.792
Hello.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.871
Who?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.188
Santiago.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.392
You're in England? Where?

25:37.480 --> 25:39.789
Uh... Somewhere in London.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.791
So. Glen...

25:42.480 --> 25:44.232
how do I get to Newcastle?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.196
Hey. How's it going?

26:24.280 --> 26:28.398
Why didn't you call me from LA?
Let me know you were coming?

26:28.480 --> 26:31.040
- Is it OK that I'm here?
- Oh. No. No. It's fine.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.829
Just caught me a bit off guard. That's all.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.832
Well. You'd best stay with me
till you get settled.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.388
- OK.
- Welcome to the Toon.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.030
- What is that?
- It's where the Geordies live.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.033
- What is a Geordie?
- Someone that lives in the Toon.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.190
You've a lot to learn. Bonny lad.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.352
<i>You mean toons. Like Looney Tunes
and stuff? Like Bugs Bunny?</i>

27:15.840 --> 27:17.751
Thank you.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.390
- You live here alone?
- Aye.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.948
Well. My daughter you met.

27:24.640 --> 27:29.634
- Do you have a wife?
- She died a couple of years ago - cancer.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.276
I'm sorry.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.549
My grandma...

27:40.640 --> 27:42.676
She sent you this.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.671
Oh. It's...

27:45.560 --> 27:48.438
She has it since she's a little girl.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.193
I'm not much of a Catholic. Mind.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.589
She thinks you're a good man. So...

27:59.840 --> 28:02.513
Santiago. Your dinner's ready.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.511
Santiago.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.155
I thought you worked in football.

29:56.240 --> 30:00.028
Not any more. I was finished a while back.
Like some of these cars.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.908
- You fix 'em?
- Aye. I fix them. Restore them.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.074
Listen. There'll not be anyone
at the club till ten o'clock.

30:09.160 --> 30:12.914
So why don't you get yourself something
to eat? Some breakfast or something?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.639
- Yeah.
- Do you have any money?

30:15.720 --> 30:18.109
No. But I'm OK.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.150
- No. I can't.
- It's OK.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.640
Take it. Turn right.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.631
Just for now.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.155
Here. Mate. Watch the ball.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.151
Oh. No.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.316
Hey. Mister. Can we have wor ball back?

30:47.320 --> 30:50.551
- Quite tasty.
- Aye. If you work in a circus.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.950
- I'm done. Sorry. Here.
- Nice one.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.394
I hear some players
have a problem with Gavin Harris.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.550
- Divvent like his attitude.
- Aye.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.677
Well. Three clubs in five years
should tell you something.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.593
I think he's better playing on the inside.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.796
If he's in a mood. He gets lost out wide.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.677
Aye. Right enough. Like.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.670
What are you looking at?

31:13.760 --> 31:16.399
Sorry. But you're
talking about soccer. Right?

31:16.480 --> 31:19.278
- No.
- Football?

31:19.360 --> 31:22.318
Oh. Aye. Yeah.
That's all there is to talk about.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.391
- Where are you from. Son?
- Los Angeles.

31:24.480 --> 31:28.598
Oh. Aye? You know Charlize Theron?
She's a cracker. Like.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.992
- What are you doing up here?
- I have a tryout for Newcastle United.

31:33.080 --> 31:36.311
- A trial. Like? Howay.
- Are you serious. Lad?

31:36.400 --> 31:38.311
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe today. Actually.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.392
You wanna lay off the black pudding. Son.

31:43.280 --> 31:47.273
- What is it exactly?
- You don't want to know.

31:48.960 --> 31:52.839
Football's a religion here. London has any
number of teams. Same in the Midlands.

31:52.920 --> 31:57.152
Manchester. You've got two. Liverpool.
You've got two. Glasgow's got two.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.834
Up here. Though. It's just the Toon.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.552
There she is.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.556
- Is that the manager?
- Erik Dornhelm. Mr Dornhelm.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.790
He can be intimidating.
Look him in the eye.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.838
I don't think my look will make a difference.

32:24.920 --> 32:29.789
- It'll be my feet.
- Mr Dornhelm. Excuse me. Glen Foy.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.269
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.920
- Hi.
- He's from Los Angeles.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.276
Santiago Munez.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.391
When was this?

32:42.360 --> 32:44.430
When I phoned you
in the middle of the night.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.636
You promised to give him a trial.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.154
Yes. One minute. Please.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.954
Like that?
Score a hat trick. You can have it.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.670
I'm sure you have a watch and I'm
absolutely sure it's an expensive one.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.512
What time does it say?

32:59.600 --> 33:03.195
Sorry. Boss. I was dropping a shirt off
for a sick kid in hospital.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.955
The PR people should have had a camera.
Would have been a really good photo op.

33:07.040 --> 33:13.149
That. I think. Is bullshit. There are six
journalists inside. Waiting for 15 minutes.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.674
Get in there.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.117
- And today. You train with the reserves.
- Oh. F...

33:23.280 --> 33:26.078
- Where do you play?
- Los Angeles.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.355
I meant position.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.796
Yeah. For my team. I play up front.
But I prefer midfield.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.440
That way. I see more of the ball.

33:39.320 --> 33:42.232
Get him over to the training ground.
Let's see what he's got.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.629
Will do. Thank you very much.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.750
Hey. I'll be around.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.188
Oh. You're there.
How are you feeling. Son?

34:21.280 --> 34:24.989
- OK.
- Good. Mal Braithwaite. Club coach.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.436
I've been a friend of Glen's
since he played here. So I'm on your side.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.272
- All right?
- Yeah. Thank you. Sir.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.554
I'm not a sir. I'm a coach.

34:32.639 --> 34:36.918
Sir is the gaffer. That's who's gonna
be watching you today. All right? Fit?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.911
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's go.

34:41.639 --> 34:45.030
Come on. It'll be fine.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.793
Yeah.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.638
- Come on.
- Get up the field.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.354
- Behind you.
- Keep moving it.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.396
Put it square.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.072
Son.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.116
I want you midfield. On the right. OK?

35:04.200 --> 35:06.111
- Gavin... You know who Gavin is?
- No.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.713
- Slot in behind him there.
- OK.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.109
That's the fella. OK?

35:10.200 --> 35:13.954
- Get Adie off.
- Adie. Come off.

35:16.440 --> 35:20.069
OK. Pal. Swap bibs with him.
Do your best.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.913
Hey. Mal. Mal. Who's the muppet?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.798
He's from Mexico. Be gentle. Son.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.110
Yeah. I'll look after him.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.398
Hey. Yo. Hey. Yo. Yo.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.157
That's it. Phil.

35:50.680 --> 35:55.196
- How are you. Mal? Bobby. How are you?
- All right. Boss?

35:55.760 --> 35:59.514
Franny. Bring the kid into the game.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.432
Look at me.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.271
Here. Yo. Yo.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.033
Oh. Fuck.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.832
- What? A bit louder. Please.
- Oh. Come on.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.518
Here.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.233
All right. Let me call you back.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.990
Let the kid take it.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.711
Go on. Have a go.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.680
Face up. How many?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.271
Adios. Amigo.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.476
Santiago.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.199
Get yourself a shower.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.234
I don't know. Glen.

38:32.320 --> 38:36.438
My legs wouldn't do
what my brain was telling them.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.592
I'll be better tomorrow. I promise.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.275
There's not gonna be
a tomorrow. Santiago.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.911
Get in the car.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.556
You know. My father believes
people have a place in life.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.029
You work. You feed your family.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.758
You die.

39:18.720 --> 39:22.076
And it's foolish to think otherwise.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.473
- Excuse me. Sir...
- I had a word with the fellow on the door.

39:34.560 --> 39:39.953
He said I could come in and just look
for someone. I won't be a second.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.189
Mr Dornhelm.
Glen Foy from this morning.

39:46.280 --> 39:50.353
Listen. I'm sorry
to interrupt the proceedings.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.590
Have I missed all the boring speeches?

39:52.680 --> 39:56.195
I'm making one of the "boring" speeches.
This distraction is not welcome.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.477
Well. If you'd answered my calls.
I wouldn't be here.

39:59.560 --> 40:04.111
- What do you want?
- Listen. This kid. Santiago Munez.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.636
- Would you like to sit here?
- Sure. Thanks.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.314
Listen. He's grown up
in poverty and hardship

40:10.400 --> 40:13.676
and his only way out
is his skill with the ball.

40:13.760 --> 40:17.196
He's flown 6.000 miles on my say-so.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.714
He's jet-lagged. He's nervous.

40:19.800 --> 40:24.271
You know. He's never seen mud before
and you put him on a pitch like that.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.875
And then you spend
the whole time on your mobile.

40:27.960 --> 40:33.398
- I saw him flat on his ass most of the time.
- Yet there was one moment of magic.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.109
When he took the ball on the bounce.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.397
- Turned Magowan. Took it down.
- I saw it.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.874
Looks good.
Hear they do you well here.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.030
Listen. When I was a scout.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.309
I used to spend the whole time.
On muddy days.

40:52.400 --> 40:56.393
Watching young lads
clogging the shite out of each other.

40:56.480 --> 41:01.952
And just once in a while. There'd be one
that'd come along and lift your heart.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.554
Like this lad.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.270
Just give him a month.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.273
Ah. So you found all my yesterdays?

41:47.360 --> 41:49.351
I was just looking.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.509
My wife made this scrapbook.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.433
You never told me
you were a major-league player.

41:55.520 --> 41:59.513
Aye. Well. Not for as long as I'd have liked.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.751
- Why?
- Got an injury. Did my knee in.

42:03.680 --> 42:07.309
Look at that.
Shorts were shorter. Hair was longer.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.392
Didn't make £8 million a year. Either.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.076
- But you were still heroes.
- Oh. Aye.

42:14.160 --> 42:17.755
Footballers have always been heroes.
Even in my father's day. Earning £8 a week

42:17.840 --> 42:21.230
and working down the mine
at the same time.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.756
- There you go.
- No. I can't accept it. It's too special.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.035
I'm not giving it to you.
Just try it on.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.351
I want to see what you look like
in the black and white.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.795
- What's the point?
- What's the point?

42:34.880 --> 42:37.440
Well. You've got a month's trial.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.520
Better phone your granny again.

42:55.280 --> 42:59.353
Right. Listen up. You lot.
This is Santiago Munez. He's from Mexico.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.908
- No. Los Angeles.
- Los Angeles. Whatever.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.072
Before this day's done.
I want you to let him know who you are.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.310
OK. Right. Let's get to it.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.116
Push it hard. Hard.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.756
Nice one. Franny.
Nice work. Come on.

43:19.840 --> 43:21.671
15.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.273
16.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.396
17.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.271
Come on. Santiago.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.874
- Santi. I've been to Mexico once.
- Did you like it?

43:49.960 --> 43:52.155
Gave me the shits for a week.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.231
One day. Son.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.474
But not today. Come on. Move.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.637
Thank you.

44:15.240 --> 44:18.471
- Do you want to sit down. Please?
- OK.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.434
- It may be a little high.
- Why's that?

44:47.520 --> 44:51.354
Well. 'cause you are so close
and you smell nice.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.069
It's normal.

44:57.640 --> 45:01.792
- Are you the club doctor?
- No. I'm his nurse. He'll examine you soon.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.792
- Did you fill in the paperwork?
- Yeah.

45:04.880 --> 45:08.475
Just a couple of words I didn't understand.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.554
OK. Like what?

45:13.320 --> 45:15.834
Like this one here.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.790
That's "cardiovascular".
It means "heart problems".

45:19.880 --> 45:21.871
Oh. No. No.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.712
And how about that one?

45:23.800 --> 45:29.750
"Respiratory" - do you have any problems
with your lungs or breathing?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.271
Do you?

45:33.800 --> 45:35.074
No.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.674
Do you wanna step on the scales?

45:43.040 --> 45:45.076
Right.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.997
- What's your name?
- Nurse Harmison.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.356
- I mean your first name.
- You don't need to know that.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.113
You don't need to know where I live.
What my star sign is.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.156
Or what I'm doing on Saturday night.

45:57.240 --> 46:02.837
- I'm gonna have to take blood.
- Oh. Man. Really? I don't like needles.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.232
But you have a tattoo.
Or is that a rub-on transfer?

46:07.320 --> 46:10.198
- That was a gang thing.
- You were in a gang?

46:12.640 --> 46:14.551
Not any more.

46:17.120 --> 46:21.318
There's only three ways to get out
of a gang - you get shot. You go to jail. Or...

46:21.400 --> 46:25.279
In my case. You have a grandmother
who kicks some sense into you.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.395
Sorry. Tough guy.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.318
- What's your problem?
- Problem? What problem?

46:47.400 --> 46:49.550
- Come on.
- Ignore him. He's a tit.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.074
- Walk away.
- He's a knobhead. Laughing at you. Mate.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.435
- He's a knobhead. Mate.
- Hey. Forget him.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.796
- Knobhead? Knobhead?
- Come on. Let's get a game going.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.435
- How long did they give you?
- A month.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.431
A month?

47:03.600 --> 47:06.751
That's not long.
At least I got six.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.479
I was with Tranmere Rovers before this.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.790
They signed me from school
when I was 14.

47:11.880 --> 47:14.758
- How's it going?
- Early days.

47:18.240 --> 47:22.313
That's Gavin Harris.
They just signed him for £8 million.

47:22.400 --> 47:26.188
Dining with the bum-bandit today.
Are we. Jamie?

47:27.040 --> 47:31.079
Hughie Magowan's 33. Unless every other
centre back in the squad breaks his leg.

47:31.160 --> 47:34.391
- He'll not play for the first team again.
- Why be so pissed with me?

47:34.480 --> 47:40.077
Well. You're the new kid on the block. Son.
You've got something he never had - flair.

47:40.160 --> 47:42.230
Flair?

47:42.320 --> 47:44.675
Aye.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.992
You know. Most players. Myself included.
They play within themselves.

47:49.080 --> 47:53.278
They play to their strengths
so they don't expose their weaknesses.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.079
The great players. The ones with flair.
They take risks.

47:56.160 --> 47:59.311
Because they don't believe they're risks.
Put your coat down here.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.470
Three and in. You're in.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.437
All righty.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.791
They control the ball.
The ball doesn't control them.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.791
Here.

48:11.840 --> 48:16.709
Look at this.
Two jackets and a ball. It's all you need.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.871
Finished with that. Son?

48:31.800 --> 48:34.189
Yeah.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.111
Sorry. Sorry.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.110
Santi.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.514
There you go.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.149
Hey. Listen.
I could show you the town if you like.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.268
Tonight. Go clubbing.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.430
Bevvy. Women.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.353
Yeah. Uh...
Do I need an ID or something?

49:06.880 --> 49:09.440
- ID?
- Yeah.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.750
- Identification?
- Yeah.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.957
How old do you have to be here
to get a drink?

49:15.040 --> 49:16.393
Eleven.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.236
All right. Gavin.

49:33.320 --> 49:36.551
Listen. Mate. If you want an autograph.
Write to the club. You muppet.

49:36.640 --> 49:40.235
Listen. Elvis. I'm with the club too.
Mate. I'm with the club too. You know.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.754
I've never seen you before.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.149
I don't go out much.

49:45.240 --> 49:49.028
Hey. Hey.
Nurse Harmison. Nurse Harmison.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.112
- Hi.
- You wanna come into this club with us?

49:52.200 --> 49:54.839
No way. It's full of posers. That place.

49:54.920 --> 49:58.071
- Yeah? Where are you going?
- We're going to The Spyglass.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.549
- What do you say?
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.591
Here we go. Here we go.

50:10.680 --> 50:14.468
Canny wine. This Rioja. It's from
your part of the world. Isn't it? Spain.

50:14.560 --> 50:17.552
- No. I'm from LA.
- I'm from Merseyside.

50:17.640 --> 50:21.110
LA? And Merseyside?
What are you two doing up here?

50:22.160 --> 50:25.516
- Well...
- We play for Newcastle.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.714
I thought you said players were off limits.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.598
Relax. They haven't made the reserves yet.

50:32.480 --> 50:36.632
Well. As long as you're mired in mediocrity.
Pet. You're in with a chance.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.756
I'm sorry. But I don't know what that means.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.958
It means don't change.
Don't become something you're not.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.794
Well. My life's already changed.
Just by being here.

50:46.880 --> 50:50.668
I grew up on a council estate with a dad
on the dole and a mum on the booze.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.990
Change is fine with me.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.831
I remember you now.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.388
- You're the one with the toe.
- What?

50:58.480 --> 51:01.597
You had fungus behind your big toenail.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.516
- What? Did you have to mention that?
- Oh. Man.

51:05.600 --> 51:08.239
I guess in your job.
You must see the whole team naked?

51:08.320 --> 51:12.950
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I'm not gonna ask who has the biggest.

51:13.040 --> 51:17.079
- OK. What were you gonna ask?
- Who has the smallest?

51:17.960 --> 51:20.030
It must be you. Because she cannot tell us.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.634
- Go on. Come on.
- Mark him. Mark him.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.029
Space. Hit space.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.592
Stick with him.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.469
- Remember what I told you.
- Here. Here.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.755
OK. Pass. Pass the ball.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.679
Pass it.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.716
Why didn't you pass the ball. Man?

51:42.800 --> 51:44.677
Hey. Mal.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.351
Munez.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.317
Come here.

51:52.080 --> 51:56.312
Hey. Lads. Over here.
Come on. Gather round.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.994
Hey. Mal. Give me five minutes.

51:59.080 --> 52:01.355
- OK. Boss.
- Thank you.

52:01.760 --> 52:07.596
So when I say go. I want you
to run as fast as you can to the goal.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.557
- OK?
- Yeah.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.517
Go.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.079
Come back.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.596
Again. Go.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.355
What did you learn?

52:37.440 --> 52:40.910
- That you can score from halfway.
- No.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.037
That the ball can travel faster than you.

52:44.640 --> 52:47.950
Here. We pass the ball.
You understand that?

52:48.040 --> 52:50.873
We're a unit. Not a one-man show.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.555
The name on the front of the shirt is
more important than the one on the back.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.870
- OK?
- Yeah.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.831
- Santi.
- Hey.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.518
This is the final countdown
for Newcastle Utd.

53:22.600 --> 53:26.149
Only three games left this season.
And to qualify for Europe

53:26.240 --> 53:29.118
in the Champions League.
And all the riches that go with that.

53:29.200 --> 53:32.397
They'll have to win them all - starting today.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.551
Oh. Man.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.757
Never an easy team to beat. Chelsea.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.718
- Well-coached. Well-drilled.
- They certainly are.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.511
The game. Yeah.

53:55.160 --> 53:57.913
I'm with Gavin's girlfriend.
I'll call you back.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.911
Lads.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.429
Toon. Toon.
Black and white army.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.034
Toon. Toon. Black and white army.

54:12.280 --> 54:14.748
Toon. Toon. Black and white army.

54:43.640 --> 54:46.200
How's that possible?

55:05.960 --> 55:07.871
For all their possession.
You have to say

55:07.960 --> 55:11.509
Newcastle haven't yet created
one clear-cut chance.

55:13.400 --> 55:14.833
- He's fading.
- Aye.

55:14.920 --> 55:18.469
By a brilliant sense of positional play.
He's avoided contact with the ball.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.950
- Well. Maybe he's playing hurt.
- No. He's hungover.

55:22.040 --> 55:24.395
- Right. Get him off.
- Shola.

55:31.040 --> 55:34.953
Now. This looks quite bad for Newcastle.
The last thing they need is another injury.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.396
They've already got
several walking wounded out there.

55:38.480 --> 55:42.951
Number ten off. Mate.
Free kicks and get far post at corners.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.271
Wait a second.
It's Gavin Harris who's coming off.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.271
What? Me?

55:49.240 --> 55:52.869
He's taking Gavin off.
What the hell is he thinking about?

55:52.960 --> 55:55.633
What are you thinking about.
You German twat?

55:55.720 --> 55:58.473
Substitution for Newcastle United.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.633
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

56:07.240 --> 56:11.119
Only five minutes left to play.
Still no score.

56:11.200 --> 56:14.272
Chelsea still have the upper hand.

56:25.320 --> 56:28.676
Goal. They've got one at last.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.552
And it's Patrick Kluivert.

56:51.600 --> 56:55.115
- Evening. Mr Dornhelm.
- Good night. Sir.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.152
Yeah.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.715
What are you doing here?
Are you hurt?

57:37.800 --> 57:40.758
- No. No. No. No. I got great news.
- What?

57:40.840 --> 57:42.831
I made the reserve squad.

57:42.920 --> 57:45.753
- Oh. That's great.
- I've only one week left on my trial.

57:45.840 --> 57:49.469
This game is make-or-break. If the boss
sees me do well. He'll keep me on.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.393
- I'm sure he will.
- Do you play for Newcastle?

57:52.480 --> 57:55.278
- Yeah.
- Well. Sign your name on that.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.072
OK.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.509
They'll all be asking
for your autograph soon.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.717
Will that bother you?
What is your problem with footballers?

58:05.800 --> 58:10.191
I don't have a problem with football.
It's fame I have a problem with.

58:10.280 --> 58:14.239
It's my dad's fault. He was in a rock band
that got hot for five minutes.

58:14.320 --> 58:18.836
- No way. Would I know him?
- I doubt it. I was only three.

58:18.920 --> 58:22.390
Anyway. The point is.
Some of the players remind me of him.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.914
One minute they're nice.
Uncomplicated guys

58:25.000 --> 58:30.677
and the next they're ridiculously rich
arseholes who walk out on their families.

58:32.520 --> 58:34.909
It was my mother who left mine.

58:36.520 --> 58:40.559
- Why? What happened?
- My father never talks about it.

58:41.120 --> 58:44.954
All I remember
is his anger and his drinking.

58:50.680 --> 58:52.750
He's never seen me play.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.716
I love that game. Love football.

58:59.800 --> 59:02.633
Every night after school
and Sundays after church. I'd play.

59:02.720 --> 59:05.792
All I hoped was that one day.
Football could be my whole life.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.589
Why did you have to come so far
to make it happen?

59:10.640 --> 59:13.632
For that. You have to ask the saints.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.270
Why don't you tell him. Grandma?

59:19.360 --> 59:20.270
Tell me what?

59:22.960 --> 59:24.996
Santiago called me.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.074
He sounds very happy.

59:28.600 --> 59:31.512
Tell him about the game.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.909
He's playing tomorrow night

59:34.000 --> 59:35.672
for the reserve team.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.755
After just three weeks.
That's fantastic. No?

59:40.840 --> 59:44.594
He left like a thief.
Without saying goodbye.

59:44.960 --> 59:47.633
Why should I care?

59:54.600 --> 59:58.479
Ey-up. Lads.
Sit down. Pay attention.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.512
Dagger's hamstring is holding up.
So we'll give him a half.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.398
Santiago. I want you on the right flank.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.755
Track the number eight.
He's a slippery bugger.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.990
- I'll translate that for you later.
- Jamie.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.389
I want you to slot in behind the two strikers.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.711
Remember. Don't let 'em
panic you into playing football.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.598
- Howay.
- Right. Come on. Let's go.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.472
Let's kick some arse. Fellas.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.949
Come on. Boys.
Let's go. Let's do this.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.553
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Manchester United

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.597
What's that?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.551
What's wrong with him?

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.272
Right. Let's have a look.
Let's have you back.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.670
Jackie. How are we?
Santiago. Get back.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.353
Here. Mate. Do you wanna put on
a red shirt? You're having a shocker.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.351
You all right?

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.349
- I think that's enough.
- I think you're right.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.392
OK.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.432
Go and get yourself an early bath. Son.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.554
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.035
Been out on the town?

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.430
Is there something
you want to tell me. Son?

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.992
OK.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.911
I don't know. Santi.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.594
I know you've got the skill.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.754
But maybe you don't have the pace
or the stamina for the English game.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.389
Maybe you'd be better off
playing back in LA.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.400
I'm gonna have to let you go. Son.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.312
- Yes?
- Does Roz live here?

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.151
Rosie. It's for you.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.631
Oh. God.
Mam. I'm a wreck.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.917
Are you the young man from LA?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.150
Yes. Santiago.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.151
- She'll be down in a minute.
- Thank you.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.470
- Can I get you anything. Pet?
- No. Thank you.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.916
I went there years ago
when my husband's band was on tour.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.709
We stayed at the Hyatt House on Sunset.
Called it the Riot House in those days.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.997
- Aren't you meeting your friends?
- No mad rush.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.190
Nice to meet you. Santiago.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.077
Nice to meet you. Ma'am.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.709
- I love that name.
- Off you go.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.078
- What's wrong?
- I lied to you.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.351
At the physical.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.115
- I have asthma.
- OK. Well. Have you told them?

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.350
If I had. They wouldn't have given me a trial.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.829
- So tell them now.
- Too late.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.797
- They fired me.
- Oh. Sant.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.076
I'm so sorry.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.311
I came to say goodbye.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.156
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.949
- Why so soon?
- I don't belong here if I'm not in the team.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.474
Well. You can find another team.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.915
I guess I was just...

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.118
I was just dumb to think
I could make this work.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.436
- Worst thing is I've let people down.
- No.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.390
- Who. Pet?
- Glen.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.873
My grandma. My grandma.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.918
This happens to players all the time.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.918
It's part and parcel of the game.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.591
No. We...

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.430
We hardly know each other.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.789
Shit.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.076
- Aren't you...
- No.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.392
I can see why they took you off last week.
You're shite.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.756
Been shagging them Armitage sisters?

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.274
Well. You're not the first.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.793
- Paradise Taxis.
- I need one. Urgent. This is Gavin Harris.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.758
And I'm Clint Eastwood. Make my day.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.152
But I'm serious.
This is me. I need a ride. Pronto.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.110
- Are you anywhere near Blakelaw?
- Why?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.397
Gavin Harris is stuck on the estate
and needs a car. Desperate.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.554
- I've already got a fare.
- He's first team. Man. Get there ASAP.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.792
Gotta do a detour. Bonny lad.
Celebrity in peril.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.519
You're that kid from LA?
You going to training as well?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.036
- No. I have to get to the station.
- Why?

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.680
- I screwed up.
- Tell me about it on the way.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.593
I don't know what
the gaffer will do if I'm late.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.229
So you're Gavin Harris?

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.996
- Guilty.
- You're shite.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.715
So I've heard.
Come on. Santi.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.189
With all due respect. Gaffer. Mr Dornhelm.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.192
The club will be making a big mistake
if they let this lad go.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.555
I've played with him.
I've played against him.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.712
I can see he's got it.
So can all of the other lads.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.314
- I mean. Technically...
- What? He's better than you?

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.558
Well.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.795
He's in that league.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.318
What happened last night was he lost his
inhaler. He's got asthma. For God's sake.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.709
Is this true?

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.359
Yes. Sir. But I tried to hide it.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.834
Lying is a problem.
Asthma is not.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.388
You can get shots.
Medication. Acupuncture.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:16.438
Didn't your doctor back home
explain this to you?

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.638
I don't have a doctor.
All I got is a free clinic in LA.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.917
- People keep pleading your case. Munez.
- All I wanna do is prove them right. Sir.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.354
If you give me the chance.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:35.352
- You think you deserve it?
- I know I do.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.117
Good.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.475
See the doc.
Tell him about your condition.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.791
Then report for training. All right?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.230
Thank you.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.399
Gavin.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.553
This is a decent thing you did.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.108
Yeah. I do what I can.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.670
Now explain why are you
dressed for discotheque

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.354
and 47 minutes late for training?

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.549
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Queens Park Rangers

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.592
- Come on.
- You like him?

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.591
Yeah.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.035
Go on.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.115
- Stand up. Santi.
- Away you go. Fellas. Away.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.111
Yes. Please.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.116
Yeah.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.875
- Bloody late.
- Got there as quick as I could.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.269
Hughie. Hughie.
Yes. Please. Fella.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.476
No more of that.
That is naughty. OK?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.358
- Away you go.
- He'll think twice about doing you again.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.637
- Thought you didn't like me.
- My sister will be upset if you get hurt.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.269
She thinks you look like Antonio Banderas.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.591
Hey. If you shag her. I'll kill you.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.271
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Middlesbrough

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.070
- Be careful.
- OK. I can't see a thing.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.993
OK. You're almost there. Little step.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.548
Little step down. Right.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.239
Oh. My God. It's amazing.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.035
- Can you believe this?
- No.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.237
A month ago. I said goodbye to the city.
Goodbye to you.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.436
And now I've got a contract.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.278
- And this little apartment.
- How can you afford it. Though?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.833
Gavino.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.956
Say hello to my friend.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.632
Hello.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.639
I didn't say you could bring women here.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.109
Oh. I'm sorry. Shall I go?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.396
<i>- I'm just kidding. Man. Ciao. Bella.
- How's it going?</i>

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.758
Oh. Make yourselves at home.
There's finger stuff in the fridge.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.071
Oh. Takeaway pizzas and ladies knickers?

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.195
Not hard to figure out his lifestyle. Is it?

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.238
He's all right.
He saved my ass. Remember?

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.350
- Got a bit of a rep is what I've heard.
- For professionals. Football is our life.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.952
- Good to see you.
- How are you tonight?

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.439
Gavin. You all right?

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.313
Colin. It's a very good offer.
But just forget about it.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.630
I'll tell you.
'Cause the chairman is a tosser.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.951
The manager knows and says nothing.
Which makes him a bigger tosser.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.951
The players know it.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.511
Yeah. It's all clans and cliques
in the dressing room. Innit. Luv?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.955
- Yeah. Gav.
- Little bit on your nose. Mate.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.158
24-7. mate.
Listen. What's cool and hangs up?

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.992
All right. Mate.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.833
- All right. Baz.
- Look at you. Crispy. Mate. How are you?

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.798
- Say hello to Santi.
- Heard it's going good. Mate.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.838
Notched a pair for the reserves Saturday.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.712
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you doing?

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.395
So. Santi. You got your contract sorted
to the end of the season?

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.951
Do you mind if I ask actually
who handled that for you?

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.235
- Glen.
- Glen Foy?

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.471
- Works in a garage. Bruv.
- Well. It's not actually...

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.156
Don't get me wrong. He's a lovely fella.
He used to be an absolute cracking player.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.438
But what does he know
about marketability?

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.953
What does he know about endorsements?

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.316
You make the first team.
Santi. Next season...

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.070
I'll get you a Gap ad.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.230
Crunch.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.713
Hey. Pet. Do you fancy a dance?

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.836
Watch out. He's a salsa man.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.517
No. Thank you. Sorry.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.913
Hello.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.310
Santiago? Hey. Bro.
What's going on?

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.152
No way.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.239
Papa. It's Santiago.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.276
He wants to talk to you.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.714
Tell him I'm not here.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.071
He can't talk right now. OK?

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.554
No problem. Man.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.231
Ey-up. Lads.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.594
Take them up the back pitch. Andy.
Give 'em a stretch.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.716
Kicked me out. Bin-bagged.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.759
- I've got my eye on you. Hughie.
- See you in the showers. Bobby.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.199
- What's up?
- What's up? I just saw the reserve list.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.192
I'm not on the team.
I didn't even make the bench.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.191
I don't get it.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.272
I play where you tell me to play.
I play how you tell me to play.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.874
I didn't drop you. Son.
You're not at my disposal.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.270
- What are you talking about?
- You're playing with that lot.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.794
In London on Saturday.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.910
Santiago.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.478
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.074
OK. Guys. Let's get to work.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.151
Come on.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.912
Newcastle scraped through
with a win over Chelsea.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.436
But it won't be enough in itself.
Liverpool are breathing down their necks.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.435
And to make it worse. There is a makeshift
look to the Newcastle United line-up today

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.911
with all their injury problems. And one
of their substitutes. Santiago Munez.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.719
- Is an unknown quantity.
- He is.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.268
Apparently he was discovered
playing in Los Angeles

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.954
by Glen Foy. The ex-Newcastle midfielder.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.316
He's been turning some heads
with his performances in the reserves.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.550
But this is a much. Much higher level.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.237
I just wonder how he will cope
if he does get the nod at some point today.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.268
- What have I missed?
- Not a lot.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.679
- How are you feeling?
- I'll feel better if we get three points.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.750
- He's useless. He's useless.
- Howay. Man. Give him a break.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.469
- Get in there.
- Put a challenge in. Man.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.790
Did you see that?

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.908
Come on. Ref.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.791
Munez.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.759
Munez. You're going on.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.240
A bold move.
But in the circumstances.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.311
I don't think he's got much other choice.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.437
And it is now quite a day
for this young man.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.114
This is a chance to show your worth.
Give me your jacket.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.794
Show them what you've got. Son.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.029
Come on.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.031
Who the hell is this?

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.630
That's my son.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.432
That's my boy. Santiago.
I'm his father.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.798
If he scores. Like. I'll buy you a pint.
Come on. Son. Sit at the bar.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.791
Come on.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.148
Substitution for Newcastle United.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.674
Coming off. Number 13. Carl Francis.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.355
Being replaced by number 26.
Santiago Munez.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.071
Go on. Yes.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.309
What a great run by Munez.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.868
Brought down. Penalty.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.677
Come on. Boys.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.957
Penalty. Boys. Penalty.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.273
- Down. You.
- I can't watch it if that playboy's taking it.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.350
Just calm it down. All right?

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.471
I hate this stuff.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.672
- I'll buy you that pint now. Son.
- It's a little early.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.275
Not in Newcastle. It's not.
Howay. The lads.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:45.755
Only seconds to go and if it ends like this.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.753
It will be a happy journey back to
the Northeast for the Newcastle players.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.393
- Right. You should lie down. You.
- Aye.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.391
Salsa man.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.956
Munez.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.794
Ah. Beautiful. I know.
Beautiful stuff.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.150
What did you notice
when you won that penalty?

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.789
Uh. I noticed... the goal?

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.792
You should have noticed two players
in a better position than you.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.075
You don't pass.
You go for glory.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.390
Sven. How are you?

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.833
Stop brooding about it. Man.
The gaffer does that to everyone.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.117
You played great.
Everyone saw that. Yeah.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.474
Hey. Hey. Johnny.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.710
- Santiago.
- Hey.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.756
Congratulations. You were amazing.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.831
Oh. Thanks.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.710
My whole family are mad Real Madrid fans.
My grandma. She loves you. Man.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.998
Well. Carry on playing like that.
You'll be there one day.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.478
- See you around.
- Nice to meet you.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.639
- You know how it is. It's your service.
- Gavino. I just...

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.634
Hey. Let me introduce you to my mates.
That's Zizou.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.915
This is Raul.
Santiago Munez.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.550
What the hell are you doing with him?

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.119
He's the one with the car.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.637
We have to go.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.994
Take care. Yeah.
See you later. All right. Man.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.190
<i>They're over here shooting a commercial.
Mucho dinero. Santi.</i>

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:41.558
- Come on. Let's go. This place is dead.
- What? What do you mean? Where?

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.232
This is my town. Son.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.070
Boys. Wicked. We were gonna
send out a search party for you two.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.320
- Nice party. Man.
- This ain't the party.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.437
- Come on. Follow me.
- Upstairs again.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.472
This is the party.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.679
Hello. Boys.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:09.672
- Fill your boots. Son. It's your birthday.
- Shame on us.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.320
Get in there.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.153
- We're getting this.
- Excuse me.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.549
Come on. Don't be shy.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.750
Ball control. A bit of ball control.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:25.433
Don't be shy. Your mother wasn't.
That's it. Get in there.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.677
- Not your kind of party?
- I never know what to say.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.038
You wouldn't need to say anything
to most of the girls in there.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.669
I have a girl.
Well. I think I have one.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.875
I met someone I really like.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.349
She's very lucky.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.551
How did you and Gavino meet?

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.596
Party like this.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.069
Much the same people.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.594
Musos. Models. Footballers.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.037
Listen. Don't tell him I've gone.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.509
Not that he'd notice.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.795
Want to explain this?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.915
There's nothing to explain. Sir.
It was just people fooling around at a party.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.993
When you travel with this club.
You're an ambassador for this club.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.036
Mr Dornhelm. It's not my fault.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.237
It is your fault. You exposed yourself
to this kind of situation.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.356
- Who is the other player?
- The other one?

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.557
It says there are two Newcastle players.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.631
Who is the other one?

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.554
- I cannot tell you that. Sir.
- You mean you won't tell me?

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.391
Yeah.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.430
Roz. Roz. Hey.
I have to explain about that picture.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.033
<i>- What picture?
- In The Sun.</i>

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.270
- Don't read that rag.
- You haven't seen it?

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.636
I showed it to her.
Looked like a good party. That.

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.790
Are those lasses' tits real?

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.195
- It wasn't how it looked.
- Look. I don't wanna talk about it. OK?

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.989
I'm busy. You should go and visit
your friend Jamie while you're here.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.275
He's in examination room B.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.478
- Hey.
- Hey. Santi.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.758
- What happened. Man?
- I got stretchered off in the reserve game.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.718
They've sent me here for an MRI scan.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.032
You'll be fine.
They can fix anything these days. Man.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.389
I don't know.
It felt really bad when it happened.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.550
You could just tell.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.119
I reckon I might have to skip
them salsa lessons.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.510
His meniscus is shattered.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.477
And there's a tear
in the lateral cruciate ligament.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.835
I don't know what that means.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.948
Just tell me. Can he play again?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.030
Not if he wants to walk. No.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.031
- All right. Geezer?
- Hey.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.315
Hey. Man. Thanks
for covering for me. Yeah.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.676
You're a top man. If you fingered me.
I was right in the shitter.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.389
We're even. OK?
I don't owe you no more favours.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.954
OK.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.237
You're screwing up your life. Man.
That's how you lost Christina.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.517
- She'll be back.
- No. She won't. You know why?

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.558
'Cause she can't stand
your asshole friends.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:04.200
How do you think that picture
ends up in the paper?

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.475
Bluto sold it.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.714
How much does your buddy make dealing
drugs at all the places you get him into?

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.075
Think I'm some greaseball
who doesn't know stuff?

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.152
These are the best years of our lives
and how long have we got?

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.073
Ten. If we're lucky?
Or even less. If we get hurt like Jamie.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.871
It can happen to any of us. We're one
tackle away from flipping burgers.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.951
Get out.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.837
Go on. Piss off.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.559
Where's Dad?

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.200
He's setting the sprinklers.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.038
Come on. Dad. Let's go.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.239
Dad?

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.912
Dad.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.669
Dad. Wake up. Dad.
Dad. Wake up.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.556
Hey. Glen.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.273
Hey. I meant to come over and explain
about that thing in the newspaper.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.874
Santi. I had a call from LA.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.117
You need to phone your grandmother.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.589
- Glen. What's happened?
- His father.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.750
Heart attack. Apparently.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.755
Is he going to be all right?

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.195
Dead.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.029
- I've got it.
- No. It's OK. Man.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.632
Here.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.511
Thanks for everything.

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.831
Safe journey.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.474
- Yes. Boss.
- There you go. Brilliant. Thank you.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.437
Hey. Boss.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.794
- Can I have a word?
- Yes. Please.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.310
- I was the other bloke in that picture.
- I'm shocked.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.597
And I thought you should know...

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.199
it was me that dragged Santi
to that party to begin with.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.034
He didn't even wanna go.
It's not his scene. He's a good lad.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.429
I take full responsibility.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:27.312
Boys with big bank accounts are still boys.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.877
This is not an excuse for you any more.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.758
- You're how old?
- 28.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.195
- 29. I think.
- Yeah. Around that.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.232
The young players should
be looking to you for an example.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.357
Off the field as well as on.
Am I right?

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.874
I hear what you're saying. Boss.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.072
And...

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.712
you're not the first person to say it.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.956
Flight 19 to London Heathrow
is now boarding.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:14.353
All connecting international flights
will be listed on arrival.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.994
Sir. We're boarding now.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.516
Keep stretching. Lads.
It'll be a long day.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.998
What the hell are you doing here?
Why aren't you on the plane?

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.470
I'm sitting in the airport
and I think to myself.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.676
At least now I have an excuse.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.639
A reason to give my buddies and
everybody else why things didn't work out.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.555
"Hey. My dad died. I had to come home.
Take care of business. "

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.669
- Know why I needed an excuse?
- No.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.672
Because that's the way
my father made me think.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.716
He took away my self-belief.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.032
<i>He made it impossible
to have... aspiracion.</i>

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.078
- Aspiration. You understand?
- Yes.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.230
I don't need an excuse.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.869
The only person who can tell me
I'm not good enough is you.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.791
And even then...

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.674
I may not agree with you.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.831
You are right. Santi.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.474
There's no point in coming back.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.271
It's God's will.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.477
Hey.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.788
Hi.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:40.040
So how are you feeling?

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.115
I never made peace with my dad.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.636
- He never made peace with you either.
- No. But he never forgave me.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.631
You don't know that.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.795
How can you know that?

01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.395
What about all those pictures
you sent home?

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.678
I don't know where home is any more.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.751
Yeah. You do.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.879
It's green
and it's got a goalpost at each end.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.311
Munez.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.271
How are you doing?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.189
OK. Boss.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.398
Tough thing to lose a father.
I remember when I lost mine.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.839
Thank you.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.757
You shouldn't be here.
The groundsman is having a fit.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.751
His turf is sacred.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.512
I just...

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.869
I just wanted to see what it felt like.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.190
You know...

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.350
to be on this pitch.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.279
You'll find out Saturday.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.430
Now get off the grass.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.232
Yeah.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.637
I'm in the squad for the Liverpool game.

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.237
- Get us a ticket. Then. Will you?
- Yeah.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.788
Well done. Son. Well done.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.078
Well. I never doubted it. Son. First time
I saw you. I said to Phil. Didn't I. Phil?

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.435
- That lad's got it.
- No. You didn't.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.435
I owe you. Man.
Breakfast. Remember?

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.272
Here.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.271
Get in. We're celebrating.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.669
- Is that Gavin Harris?
- Where?

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.880
<i>We're meeting a couple of girls at a club
and then back to my gaff. La vida loca.</i>

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.552
I'm joking. Blockbuster and pizza.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.591
Can we put the top up?
My ass is freezing.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.591
Buy a coat.

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.716
It's down to this. The last game.
Against their main rivals. Liverpool.

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.031
The next 90 minutes
will decide Newcastle's fate.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.317
Will it be Europe. And all the glory
that goes with it. Next season?

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.039
If so. They have to win today.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.034
Private box?

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.315
I'd check your ticket.

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.470
So. Glen. Are you single then?

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:38.949
OK. Listen up.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.951
Guys.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.790
You know what you have to do.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.428
Sant's come on. Sant's come on.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.636
Now. Newcastle are choosing
to start with young Santiago Munez.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.678
It's only his second-ever appearance
for the senior side.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.274
I guess they'll be hoping
he produces some of the flair

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.788
that he showed
as a substitute at Fulham last week.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.829
Our ball.

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.512
Yes.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.829
- Come on. Sant. Come on. Sant.
- Go. Santiago.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.596
It is getting physical now.

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.913
You can feel the determination.
Both teams really need this win.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.915
I've got an airport pickup for you.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.710
Cannae. Tommy. I'm rushed off me feet.
I'll get back to you.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.436
Excuse me. Lads.
Room for a little 'un.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.034
- How's it going?
- We've made all the early running.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.236
- How long's it been on?
- A minute.

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.190
Given away by Liverpool.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:57.070
Alan Shearer looking to organize
a counterattack for Newcastle United.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.590
He's got support to his right.
Stephen Carr.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.190
Now Dyer taking over.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.670
Harris is getting into the middle.
Here comes Harris.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:13.151
And a goal. It's Harris.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.873
It's a dream start for Newcastle.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.070
And what a way to answer his critics.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.311
Come on.

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.395
Number ten. Gavin Harris.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.716
Referee has given the foul.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.920
Free kick to Liverpool.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.880
And they've taken it quickly.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.871
It's a corner.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.791
Free header.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.159
Liverpool are level. 1-1.

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.030
Goal-scorer for Liverpool.
Number 25. Igor Biscan.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.393
Newcastle have given
the ball away yet again.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.276
Into Baroð.
He's got a chance to shoot here.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.952
Oh. It's in.
Liverpool lead. 2-1.

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.277
They've conceded two goals
in quick succession without reply.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.555
That's a devastating blow for Newcastle.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.915
Now. Can they come back from it?

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.359
Goal-scorer for Liverpool.
Number five. Milan Baroð.

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.116
Here we go. Second half.
With Liverpool firmly in the driving seat.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:57.718
And that second goal has really
knocked the stuffing out of the fans.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.510
Oh. It's a great chance
for Gerrard...

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.750
Oh. So close.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.356
Had that gone in. It would have been
"Good night. Newcastle. "

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:20.155
Now it's Munez.
The youngster's got some great skill.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.357
Trying a give-and-go here
with Alan Shearer.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.911
Give it.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.149
Pass.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.071
Give it.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.195
- Yes.
- Come on. Pass.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.713
Pass.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.078
It's a goal. It is 2-2.

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.156
You beauty.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.310
- We should have a talk about your lad.
- Talk about what. Barry?

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.597
Representation. It's gonna be
a feeding frenzy. Gonna be murders.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.468
- A lot of sharks out there.
- I know. That's why he signed with me.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.073
You what?

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.636
Great effort by Newcastle.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:22.114
But remember. If it stays like this. It will still
be Liverpool in Europe next season.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.955
Only three minutes to go now
and Newcastle are running out of time.

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:31.477
They've got to try
and find a winner from somewhere.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.913
Back. Come on.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.912
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.909
Go on. Son. Have a poke.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.113
Let go.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.719
Free kick here.
In a very dangerous area.

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.950
- Get him off.
- Took him down. Give him a card.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.989
A real chance for Newcastle. This.
But who's going to take it?

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.030
Hey. Santi.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.955
It's yours.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:14.397
I hope they know what they're doing.
It's young Santiago Munez stepping up.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.074
With only seconds left to play.

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:23.269
And he must feel that the hopes of
an entire city are resting on his shoulders.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.556
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.597
- And I thought you didn't even like football.
- I know.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.196
Unbelievable.
Newcastle's newest and youngest player

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.317
gives the fans a brand-new song to sing.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.871
<i>Santiago. Santiago. Ole. Ole. Ole.</i>

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.478
That's my grandson. His brother.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.358
- It's true. And he's from here.
- We met his dad.

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.953
How could you?

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.749
He was here for the Fulham game. Me
darlin'. He was over the moon. Wasn't he?

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.751
Dad was here?

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:48.717
Only seconds to go.
Time almost up.

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.512
Santi.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.797
Santi. Someone wants to speak to you.

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.715
Yeah?

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.873
Santiago. Santiago. We saw the game.

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.155
Julio and me.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.711
No. Glen's daughter brought us.
You were fantastic.

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.114
<i>Si. And I wanna tell you something else.
About your father.</i>

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.954
Hey. Glen.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.709
You know when I played against Fulham?

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.711
My dad saw the game.

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.395
He saw me play. Man.

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.799
He's probably watching you right now.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.878
Santi.

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.871
Santiago.

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.951
Yeah.
