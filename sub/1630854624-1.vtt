02:45.958 --> 02:46.792
A baby?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.042
I'm not having a baby.
What on earth gives you that idea?

02:51.125 --> 02:52.875
I'm not listening to this.
This is quackery.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.542
But you're about to give birth.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.708
Are you out of your mi…

02:57.792 --> 02:59.708
Mrs. Wormwood,
you're having a contraction.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.250
I'm not having contractions.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.208
Contractions are for pregnant women…

03:04.292 --> 03:08.583
…who are having ba…
…bies!

03:09.167 --> 03:12.042
I'm having a stinking baby!

04:09.583 --> 04:10.667
What?

04:10.750 --> 04:11.792
A girl.

04:12.375 --> 04:15.042
What, you mean my son is a girl?

04:15.125 --> 04:17.000
I mean that your daughter is a girl.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.375
Yeah, but the balloons, Doctor.
I mean…

04:19.458 --> 04:21.375
the balloons, they say "boy."

04:21.458 --> 04:24.458
Mr. Wormwood, your wife has just
given birth to a beautiful, healthy,

04:24.542 --> 04:26.750
happy little girl. She's perfect.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.167
This is fantastic news.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.208
Everything all right, Matilda?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.958
Yes, thank you, Mrs. Phelps.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.958
Only, it's sort of closing time.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.458
Oh, right.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.917
I could stay while you pack up?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.583
When I say "sort of," I mean an hour ago.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.167
I already have packed up.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.333
You looked so peaceful
I didn't want to disturb you.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.625
But I just know your parents cannot wait
to have you back home.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.500
Oh, yeah, they love me home.

06:33.042 --> 06:34.792
Just… love me at home.

06:36.833 --> 06:40.583
Oh, no, it's a disaster, Harry!

06:40.667 --> 06:43.125
We forgot to send it to school!

06:43.708 --> 06:45.708
He goes to school all the time,
don't you, boy?

06:45.792 --> 06:48.625
I'm a girl, and no, I don't.
I've never been to school.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.917
-Where d'you get all the books from?
-From the library.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.375
What, they're doing books now?

06:52.458 --> 06:54.458
Oh, you are such an idiot!

06:54.542 --> 06:56.500
What, me?
I've got a business to run.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.083
It's not my job to look after brats.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.250
Haven't I got enough stress,
what with all this debt you've put us in?

07:01.333 --> 07:02.417
That <i>I've</i> put us in?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, yeah, you. Don't you get it?

07:05.083 --> 07:08.750
We're trapped in the chains of debt.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.792
And you, you expect me
to escape like I'm some kind of…

07:11.875 --> 07:13.958
flaming escapologist!

07:14.042 --> 07:17.250
Escapologist, is it?
Well, I have a whole house to run.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.875
Dinners don't microwave themselves,
you know.

07:18.958 --> 07:20.000
Hello?

07:21.417 --> 07:23.958
-Who the flaming flip's that?
-I was gonna tell you.

07:24.042 --> 07:27.125
The school inspector's here.
He's in the dining room with some floozy.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.500
What are we going to do?

07:29.583 --> 07:30.542
Well…

07:31.208 --> 07:35.083
Dr Martin Luther King once said,
"A lie cannot live."

07:36.708 --> 07:38.833
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll lie our way out of it.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.333
Like what that doctor said.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.042
Home schooling, uh, yeah.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.458
We homeschool that one.

07:46.542 --> 07:47.958
It's all the rage these days.

07:48.042 --> 07:50.917
You know, what with being a businessman
and an entrepreneur.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.958
Well, then, I understand rage.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.458
Okay…

07:55.542 --> 07:59.042
And what kind of education
does she receive here?

07:59.625 --> 08:03.167
Well, I do makeup and Harry does welding.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.750
Matilda, isn't it?

08:14.042 --> 08:15.292
My name's Miss Honey.

08:17.542 --> 08:20.292
So you've been homeschooled, have you?

08:21.333 --> 08:25.000
We were wondering if you'd like
to come to be school-schooled.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.250
We're a few weeks in already,

08:27.333 --> 08:30.583
but, uh, we've another girl
who's missed the start of term too.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.792
You could just join her.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.000
What's it like?

08:34.833 --> 08:35.917
School-school.

08:37.292 --> 08:41.875
Uh… sometimes it can be intense.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.667
But I promise you my class is just fun.

08:45.417 --> 08:49.667
I'll teach you all about history
and music and literature--

08:49.750 --> 08:53.000
Literature! So, books then?

08:54.250 --> 08:58.000
At school, we have loads of books.
Full of stories.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.000
And we'll even teach you
how to write your own.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.625
How does that sound?

09:02.708 --> 09:05.458
All right,
look, look, look, I'll sort this.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.125
I'd better go.

09:10.667 --> 09:11.583
Hm.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.583
<i> Once upon a time…</i>

09:20.042 --> 09:21.583
<i>there was a little girl…</i>

09:22.750 --> 09:24.542
<i>who was trapped.</i>

09:24.625 --> 09:27.208
I can't believe that!
Talking to me like that.

09:27.292 --> 09:30.667
How dare they!
I'm getting fined because of you!

09:30.750 --> 09:32.167
It's not my fault!

09:32.250 --> 09:33.750
You forgot to send me to school.

09:33.833 --> 09:37.208
Yeah, well you're going to school now,
and you're gonna meet The Trunchbull.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.167
The Trunchbull?

09:39.250 --> 09:41.958
Agatha Trunchbull.
Headmistress of Crunchem Hall.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.625
Big, strong, scary woman she is.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.750
Used to compete in the Olympics.
Yeah, throwing the hammer.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.875
And guess what I just did?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.667
I called her and told her

09:52.750 --> 09:57.458
what a nasty little,
troublemaking goblin you are.

09:57.542 --> 09:58.417
No!

09:58.500 --> 10:02.833
Oh, she is so looking forward
to meeting you!

10:02.917 --> 10:05.375
-That's not fair!

10:05.958 --> 10:07.083
It's not right!

10:07.167 --> 10:09.625
That oughta teach you,
ruining our life!

10:09.708 --> 10:12.417
Yeah, disgusting little gargoyle.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.917
What have you done to my hair?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.000
Oh.

13:25.042 --> 13:28.042
Why d'you want it green anyway?
Is it a circus thing or…?

13:28.125 --> 13:29.417
What circus thing?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.958
This escapologist you keep going on about.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.458
Does he have green hair?

13:33.542 --> 13:36.667
There is no escapologist,
and I keep telling you I didn't do it.

13:40.917 --> 13:44.708
<i>Escapologist… Escapologist…</i>

13:44.792 --> 13:47.792
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was a great escapologist.</i>

13:48.375 --> 13:49.792
<i>He was so kind.</i>

13:49.875 --> 13:52.917
<i>The sort of man any child</i>
<i>would love to have as their father.</i>

13:54.417 --> 13:57.250
<i>And one day he fell in love with…</i>

13:57.917 --> 13:59.625
<i>an acrobat.</i>

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Matilda?

14:20.792 --> 14:22.333
Hello, Mrs. Phelps!

14:22.417 --> 14:25.250
School doesn't start
for another hour yet, does it?

14:25.875 --> 14:29.625
Oh, I'm early because of… excitement.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.500
Miss Honey's gonna
teach us to tell stories.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.083
But I think I've got one already.

14:36.833 --> 14:40.042
I can feel it sort of wriggling in me.

14:40.125 --> 14:44.125
-Like it's bursting to get out.
-Well, I think if it's bursting,

14:44.208 --> 14:47.208
you should probably
tell it as soon as possible, don't you?

14:47.292 --> 14:48.833
I'll get us some lemonade.

14:48.917 --> 14:52.083
But it might be a bit… intense.

14:53.292 --> 14:57.792
Matilda Wormwood, stories are my business.
I think I'll be fine.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.208
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

15:01.792 --> 15:05.125
the two greatest circus performers
in the world…

15:05.208 --> 15:10.542
an escapologist, who could
escape from any lock ever invented,

15:10.625 --> 15:13.333
and an acrobat, who was so skilled,

15:13.417 --> 15:15.792
it seemed she could actually fly,

15:15.875 --> 15:18.458
-fell in love and got married.

15:18.542 --> 15:23.000
Together they performed the most
incredible feats anyone had ever seen.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.708
People would come from miles around.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.208
Kings, queens, celebrities and astronauts.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.500
But despite their love,

15:32.583 --> 15:36.083
despite their fame, they were sad.

15:36.167 --> 15:40.208
"We have everything that
the world has to offer," said the wife.

15:40.292 --> 15:43.208
"But not the one thing in the world
we want most.

15:44.167 --> 15:45.500
We do not have a child."

15:45.583 --> 15:47.208
"Patience my love,"

15:47.292 --> 15:50.542
the husband replied.
"Time is on our side.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.542
Even time loves us."

15:53.333 --> 15:56.583
But time is the one thing
no one is master of.

15:57.167 --> 16:00.875
And as time passed,
they grew quite old and still,

16:00.958 --> 16:02.167
no child.

16:02.875 --> 16:06.375
The sadness of living alone
in their big, empty house

16:06.458 --> 16:09.292
<i>drew them on to ever more dangerous feats,</i>

16:09.375 --> 16:14.125
<i>as work became the only place to escape</i>
<i>the inescapable sorrow of their lives.</i>

16:15.875 --> 16:18.167
And so it was, they decided to perform

16:18.250 --> 16:21.792
the most dangerous feat
ever in the world, ever!

16:21.875 --> 16:23.250
It is called…

16:23.333 --> 16:24.417
Said the acrobat,

16:24.500 --> 16:26.708
announcing the event to the world's press,

16:26.792 --> 16:29.667
who had gathered to listen
with bated breath.

16:29.750 --> 16:33.000
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

16:33.083 --> 16:35.167
With Dynamite in Her Hair

16:35.250 --> 16:38.250
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects…

16:38.333 --> 16:41.833
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage and…

16:41.917 --> 16:46.750
…it is the most dangerous feat
ever in the world ever!

16:52.917 --> 16:54.417
It is our destiny.

16:55.375 --> 16:57.750
It is where the loneliness of life
has led us.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.167
Well, what happened next?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.458
I… I don't know.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.125
Not yet, anyway.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.333
School's open. I'd better go.

17:13.917 --> 17:15.250
But what about the rest of the story?

17:15.333 --> 17:16.750
I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.458
Tomorrow?
But I'm over at the lake tomorrow.

17:19.542 --> 17:20.500
The lake, okay.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.958
Well, have a great day at school.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.167
And… be careful in there.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.083
Oh, I'm not worried.

17:27.167 --> 17:30.917
If people do scary things to you,
you can just do scary things back.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.250
But Matilda, remember,

17:33.875 --> 17:35.667
two wrongs don't make a right.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.042
Unless they do.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.917
In which case you've just made
a right out of two wrongs.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.375
Which has got to be good!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.292
Is it your first day too?

17:50.375 --> 17:54.625
Yes, I'm not worried,
but I think Isaac might be.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.875
What if we went in together?

17:58.917 --> 18:03.042
Yep! That way me and Isaac
can look after you if anything…

18:03.125 --> 18:04.125
You know.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.042
Oi, new kids!

19:23.333 --> 19:24.417
Why?

19:25.750 --> 19:27.958
Why? Did you hear what we said?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.167
What's Phys-Ed?

19:34.750 --> 19:35.667
Physical Education.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.292
The Trunchbull speciality.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.500
Who are you?

19:40.583 --> 19:43.375
We're prefects.
We're here to take you to class.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.333
So we're going to start learning?

19:45.417 --> 19:47.042
Oh, you'll start learning, all right.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.333
Great, I already know the alphabet.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.917
You don't know the alphabet
until we learn you the alphabet.

21:04.042 --> 21:04.875
Why?

21:06.458 --> 21:07.333
Why?

21:07.417 --> 21:08.792
Didn't you hear what we said?

21:10.083 --> 21:13.708
<i> I have become aware</i>
<i>that some of you are not yet in class.</i>

21:13.792 --> 21:14.958
<i>Correct this.</i>

21:15.042 --> 21:17.500
<i>You have five seconds to comply.</i>

21:18.750 --> 21:19.958
-<i>Five.</i>

21:21.083 --> 21:22.333
-<i>Four.</i>

21:22.417 --> 21:24.875
-<i> Three.</i>

21:24.958 --> 21:26.958
-<i>Two.</i>
-Lavender, Matilda, inside quick.

21:27.042 --> 21:28.792
<i>-One.</i>
<i></i>

21:32.167 --> 21:33.833
Hmm…

21:33.917 --> 21:37.833
Yes, uh, Miss Trunchbull
is keen on punctuality.

21:37.917 --> 21:41.375
Best not to be late.
Now, come and meet your new friends.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.083
This is Lavender and Matilda.

21:43.667 --> 21:46.250
And if there's anything too difficult,

21:46.833 --> 21:48.000
just ask a classmate.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.958
They'll help you. All right?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.125
-Miss!
-Hm?

21:52.208 --> 21:53.750
It's hurting my head.

21:55.042 --> 21:57.542
Oh, no, Nigel, that's not for you.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.792
They use this classroom
for grown-up lessons at night.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.417
They must have left it up there.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.833
Nigel. Nigel. Nigel.

22:08.917 --> 22:10.000
Nigel.

22:11.292 --> 22:14.083
Relax.

22:15.833 --> 22:16.667
Well done.

22:18.167 --> 22:21.333
Now, who would like to
polish off what's on the board?

22:21.417 --> 22:22.875
-Oh, me!
-Miss Honey, me!

22:25.083 --> 22:25.917
Matilda.

22:26.417 --> 22:27.458
How about you?

22:31.250 --> 22:34.125
So… today is reading.

22:36.125 --> 22:39.458
Now, this book
is actually for nine-year-olds…

22:39.542 --> 22:41.750
but you're all doing so well…

22:41.833 --> 22:44.667
that I thought we'd give this a try.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.958
I'd like you all
to read the first chapter.

22:48.042 --> 22:51.625
-Eric, what is a chapter?
-It's a chunk of a story, Miss.

22:51.708 --> 22:53.917
Absolutely perfect, Eric.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.208
What I'm hoping is
that you can all read the first chunk,

22:57.292 --> 23:00.333
then we'll discuss how…

23:02.208 --> 23:04.333
Matilda, what are you doing?

23:05.417 --> 23:08.667
Well, I'm polishing it off.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.125
Like you said.

23:10.208 --> 23:14.042
Oh… No, I meant polish it off.

23:15.458 --> 23:17.667
Is that… correct?

23:18.167 --> 23:19.083
Well, yeah.

23:19.167 --> 23:22.042
And then I thought
I may as well do the rest.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.875
The rest?

23:24.583 --> 23:26.458
You know, the prime numbers.

23:26.958 --> 23:29.042
Where X is the square of AB reoccur.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.250
So I realized they must have done it
knowing it was part of a sequence.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.792
Is maths your favorite thing?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.167
It's okay.
But what I really like is reading.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.583
It's like a holiday in your head.

23:44.542 --> 23:45.917
And do you do that a lot?

23:46.417 --> 23:49.083
Get away from everything.
In books, I mean.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.792
Oh, yeah, I read loads this week.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.875
Loads. In one week?

23:54.833 --> 23:57.417
So, which books did you read this week?

23:57.500 --> 24:00.458
<i>Nicholas Nickleby, Jane Eyre,</i>

24:00.542 --> 24:03.500
<i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles,</i>
<i>Of Mice and Men,</i>

24:03.583 --> 24:04.833
<i>The Lord of the Rings,</i>

24:05.417 --> 24:08.250
<i>Moby Dick, Crime and Punishment,</i>

24:09.000 --> 24:10.375
and…

24:11.458 --> 24:12.750
<i>The Cat in the Hat.</i>

24:36.542 --> 24:37.917
Don't be pathetic.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.750
-Enter.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.250
Don't just stand there
like a wet tissue, get on with it.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.417
Yes, yes, sorry.

24:54.417 --> 24:56.958
So, Miss Trunchbull, there is…

24:57.042 --> 25:00.542
in my class, a girl
called Matilda Wormwood and--

25:00.625 --> 25:03.375
Matilda Wormwood,
daughter of Mr. Harry Wormwood.

25:03.458 --> 25:04.417
Excellent man.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.875
He warned me about the brat though.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.708
Said she's a real… wart.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.667
No, Headmistress, I don't think--

25:12.750 --> 25:14.875
No. No, you do not.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.250
What is the school motto, Miss Honey?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.125
<i>Bambinatum est Maggitum.</i>

25:21.208 --> 25:25.625
<i>Bambinatum est Maggitum.</i>
"Children are maggots."

25:25.708 --> 25:28.250
Thank you for bringing this one
to my attention.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.875
I shall destroy it in due course.
Good day.

25:32.375 --> 25:36.708
Miss Trunchbull, it is my
belief that Matilda Wormwood is a genius.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.917
What? No. No.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.833
Haven't I just told you?
She is a gangster.

25:41.917 --> 25:46.000
She can do maths in her head
that I couldn't do with a calculator.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.250
And the books she's read.

25:48.333 --> 25:52.750
It is my opinion that she should be placed
in the top form with the 11-year-olds.

25:52.833 --> 25:53.833
Immediately.

25:55.958 --> 25:59.125
But what about the rules, Honey?

26:00.958 --> 26:03.375
I believe that Matilda Wormwood is…

26:04.500 --> 26:06.750
an exception to the rules.

26:08.875 --> 26:09.708
An exception?

26:10.917 --> 26:12.125
To the rules?

26:14.708 --> 26:17.250
In my school?

26:17.333 --> 26:19.250
I-- I--

27:40.833 --> 27:44.375
<i>She's done it! She is the best!</i>

28:11.458 --> 28:12.333
Sing, children.

28:12.417 --> 28:13.917
Two, three, four.

28:37.083 --> 28:37.958
Sing, Jenny!

29:29.667 --> 29:30.958
Now get out.

29:35.542 --> 29:37.000
Wormwood.

29:38.583 --> 29:39.792
Wormwood.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.833
Where are you?

29:45.083 --> 29:47.458
Do you want to hear
about my first day at school?

29:47.542 --> 29:50.667
-Yuck. I'd rather eat vegetables.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.583
It's official, I'm a genius!

29:53.667 --> 29:55.583
My losing streak is over.

29:55.667 --> 29:58.542
This fella comes into the lot.
Huge he was.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.750
Great big bear of a man.

30:00.833 --> 30:04.000
And this bear of a man wants a luxury car.

30:04.083 --> 30:06.667
Oh, lovely. But do bears drive?

30:06.750 --> 30:08.917
No. He's not a real bear.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.625
Do you have a luxury car?

30:10.708 --> 30:12.375
-I've got two, boy.
-I'm a girl.

30:12.458 --> 30:15.625
One with a smashed-in front,
and one with a smashed-in back.

30:15.708 --> 30:18.083
All I gotta do is cut them in half,

30:18.167 --> 30:21.292
glue them together
and Bob's your chipmunk.

30:21.375 --> 30:22.583
Daddy's back.

30:22.667 --> 30:23.708
But isn't that illegal?

30:23.792 --> 30:27.167
And sort of, well, wrong?

30:27.250 --> 30:30.083
-What'd he say? Wrong?

30:30.875 --> 30:31.708
Wrong?

30:33.542 --> 30:34.667
Give me that.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.500
<i>The Grapes of-- </i>Idiot!

30:38.583 --> 30:40.375
How can grapes be angry?

30:40.458 --> 30:42.417
Hey? What utter junk!

30:42.500 --> 30:44.125
It's not about grapes.

30:44.208 --> 30:45.917
Back-yakking! The little madam!

30:46.000 --> 30:47.250
I'm not back-yakking!

30:47.333 --> 30:48.417
Don't you back-yak me!

30:49.000 --> 30:51.167
I'll rip this book up in front of you.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.458
-No, it's a library book!
-Go on, do it.

30:59.667 --> 31:00.750
Go on.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.042
There!

31:19.792 --> 31:21.292
-There!

31:22.708 --> 31:25.208
Now get to bed, you little bookworm.

32:18.458 --> 32:21.708
But remember Matilda,
two wrongs don't make a right.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.708
Ah, twit face.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.250
"It's a library book.
It's a library book."

32:29.375 --> 32:30.833
Gripy little gremlin.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.292
Where's my hat?

32:35.750 --> 32:36.875
Here it is, Dad.

32:43.583 --> 32:45.250
Big stupid.

32:55.542 --> 32:59.208
But how do they all fit in there?
Her head's the same size as mine.

32:59.292 --> 33:00.875
Does it hurt, Matilda?

33:00.958 --> 33:03.667
Having all those brains squished in there?

33:04.250 --> 33:06.125
No. They seem to just…

33:07.042 --> 33:07.875
fit in.

33:08.542 --> 33:10.208
Can you do telekenipsis?

33:11.333 --> 33:13.458
It's where you have loads of brains.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.500
They squish out through your eyes,

33:15.583 --> 33:18.167
and you can move things with your mind.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.708
Look, watch this.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.958
It's not good to try to be clever.
Not here.

33:41.042 --> 33:44.208
The Trunchbull hates kids being smart.
She hates it.

33:44.292 --> 33:46.083
Isn't learning what school's for?

33:46.167 --> 33:48.542
This isn't a school. It's a prison.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.000
You don't want to get noticed.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.833
Not by Agatha.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.625
They say she turned one kid inside out.

33:54.708 --> 33:56.875
He had to walk around
in cling film to keep his organs in.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.833
That didn't really happen, Bruce.

33:58.917 --> 34:02.208
But she definitely sat on a year seven
until he was jelly.

34:02.292 --> 34:06.292
She caught Julius Rottwinkle
eating a licorice allsort in class.

34:06.375 --> 34:10.375
She picked him up, swung him around
and chucked him out of the window.

34:10.458 --> 34:11.292
Look.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.292
Teachers don't really throw children.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.667
The big kids are just trying to scare you.

34:16.750 --> 34:17.708
Scare, is it?

34:18.417 --> 34:20.958
You don't know scared until
you've been in Chokey.

34:24.542 --> 34:25.792
What's Chokey?

35:02.250 --> 35:03.708
Hide me!

35:03.792 --> 35:06.042
Someone poured a can of treacle
on The Trunchbull's chair.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.000
She thinks I did, but I never!

35:08.083 --> 35:09.667
Her knickers stuck to the seat.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.250
Silence!

35:12.875 --> 35:14.792
You're going to Chokey, kid.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.708
But that's not right!
He didn't do anything.

35:17.792 --> 35:20.167
Take it from me. The boy's doomed.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.375
Matilda, please help me.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.000
Why not just tell her that…

35:24.917 --> 35:25.833
Okay.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.167
Look, when did this happen?

35:28.750 --> 35:30.167
About 20 minutes ago.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.417
But why?

35:33.375 --> 35:35.625
You'd better hide. Quick, blazers!

35:35.708 --> 35:38.417
-Please don't tell her where I am!

35:40.125 --> 35:41.958
Run, run!

35:42.042 --> 35:42.917
Hurry up!

35:51.958 --> 35:54.375
-Be still, child!

35:57.792 --> 36:03.500
What a repellent parade
of imps and hobgoblins,

36:03.583 --> 36:06.917
chitter-chattering away.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.292
Where's the maggot known as Nigel?

36:15.750 --> 36:17.417
Over there, under those blazers.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.375
Where he's been for the last hour!

36:27.292 --> 36:28.125
What?

36:28.958 --> 36:29.792
Yeah.

36:29.875 --> 36:34.375
You see, Nigel suffers from a rare
but chronic sleep disorder, narcolepsy.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
The condition is characterized
by the sufferer

36:37.083 --> 36:39.167
experiencing bouts of fatigue

36:39.250 --> 36:41.792
and falling asleep without any warning.

36:41.875 --> 36:44.583
He fell asleep and we put him
in the blazers for safety.

36:45.667 --> 36:46.542
Didn't we?

36:48.667 --> 36:49.792
Didn't we?

36:53.625 --> 36:56.125
I had the strangest dream, Mum.

36:56.708 --> 36:57.917
I thought I was…

36:58.958 --> 37:00.417
Oh.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.042
Hello, Miss Trunchbull.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.208
Amanda Thripp.

37:13.458 --> 37:16.917
Y-- y-- yes, Miss Trunchbull?

37:17.500 --> 37:23.292
What have I said about… pigtails?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.375
I hate pigtails.

37:26.458 --> 37:28.958
But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty.

37:29.042 --> 37:31.417
Well, your mother is a twit!

37:31.500 --> 37:33.250
<i>And here she goes!</i>

37:33.333 --> 37:36.375
<i>-Look at that spin!</i>

37:36.458 --> 37:37.958
<i>Oh, my word!</i>

37:39.375 --> 37:41.708
<i>That's far! That's very…</i>

37:43.042 --> 37:44.292
<i>…and we're there!</i>

37:44.875 --> 37:46.583
Yes! Still got it.

37:47.333 --> 37:50.583
Check and see if that child
is still alive, will you?

37:55.708 --> 37:57.500
And what is your name?

37:57.583 --> 37:58.417
Matilda.

37:59.208 --> 38:00.292
Matilda Wormwood.

38:00.375 --> 38:04.458
Oh! You're Wormwood, are you?

38:05.667 --> 38:08.583
I like troublemakers, Wormwood.

38:09.458 --> 38:11.542
They make such a lovely sound…

38:12.125 --> 38:14.375
when they snap.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.500
She's alive!

38:17.125 --> 38:19.250
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

38:19.333 --> 38:21.333
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

38:21.417 --> 38:23.792
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

38:26.875 --> 38:29.958
<i>Remember, Wormwood,</i>
<i>you can never win.</i>

38:30.042 --> 38:34.375
<i>I promise you that.</i>
<i>And a promise is a promise is a promise.</i>

38:37.292 --> 38:39.833
And so the great day arrived.

38:39.917 --> 38:43.375
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

38:43.458 --> 38:45.875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

38:45.958 --> 38:49.250
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

38:49.333 --> 38:51.958
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage.

38:53.333 --> 38:57.708
It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat

38:57.792 --> 39:02.667
and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.625
Everything was arranged by…

39:39.708 --> 39:42.167
the acrobat's evil stepsister.

39:42.750 --> 39:46.333
A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower.

39:46.917 --> 39:50.125
People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart,

39:50.208 --> 39:53.833
she resented her stepsister's
success and love.

39:56.708 --> 39:58.042
Suddenly…

39:58.958 --> 40:00.833
out came the escapologist,

40:00.917 --> 40:03.208
but there was no sign of the acrobat,

40:03.292 --> 40:06.917
and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.125
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:10.708 --> 40:12.500
boys and girls,

40:12.583 --> 40:16.167
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

40:16.250 --> 40:18.875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

40:18.958 --> 40:21.292
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

40:21.375 --> 40:23.625
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage

40:23.708 --> 40:26.750
has been canceled!

40:29.750 --> 40:33.083
Canceled because my wife is…

40:33.833 --> 40:34.958
pregnant!

40:35.542 --> 40:37.542
-Oh, Matilda.

40:39.167 --> 40:42.292
Absolute… silence.

40:44.583 --> 40:47.250
You could have heard a fly burp.

40:49.833 --> 40:51.708
-Then suddenly, the audience…
-Hip, hip!

40:51.792 --> 40:55.042
…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!

41:00.583 --> 41:03.125
-The great feat was instantly forgotten.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.500
And the applause went on for over an hour!

41:09.917 --> 41:12.625
Oh, Matilda, that's wonderful!

41:12.708 --> 41:14.833
I love stories that end happily.

41:15.917 --> 41:20.708
Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister.

41:22.083 --> 41:26.500
When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!

41:26.583 --> 41:28.375
-A contract?

41:28.458 --> 41:31.583
A contract you have signed
to perform this feat.

41:31.667 --> 41:34.583
-And perform this feat, you shall!
-No.

41:34.667 --> 41:37.792
I've paid for the posters, publicity,

41:37.875 --> 41:40.292
the catering, the toilet facilities.

41:40.375 --> 41:42.292
If I give the crowd their money back,

41:42.375 --> 41:43.875
where is my profit?

41:44.458 --> 41:47.333
A contract is a contract is a contract.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.000
My hands are tied.

41:49.083 --> 41:52.292
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

41:52.375 --> 41:54.250
With Dynamite in Her Hair

41:54.333 --> 41:57.000
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

41:57.083 --> 42:00.292
Caught by The Man Locked in a Cage
will be performed,

42:00.375 --> 42:03.000
and it will be performed this day!

42:03.083 --> 42:05.667
Or off to prison you both shall go!

42:10.042 --> 42:11.958
What… what happened next?

42:13.667 --> 42:14.833
I dunno.

42:14.917 --> 42:16.875
What? How can you not know?

42:17.583 --> 42:20.667
It just comes to me in… fizzes.

42:20.750 --> 42:23.917
Well, could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.250
I don't think it works like that.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.000
Of course it doesn't.

42:28.625 --> 42:32.250
-Where is this coming from, Matilda?
-What do you mean?

42:32.333 --> 42:33.958
I mean, it's incredible.

42:34.042 --> 42:37.000
But it's taking rather a dark turn.

42:37.083 --> 42:38.750
Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.292
No, no, no. No.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.417
We must find out how it ends.

42:44.458 --> 42:46.667
All I'm saying is,
is everything all right?

42:46.750 --> 42:47.667
You could tell me.

42:47.750 --> 42:51.208
I'd better go, Mrs. Phelps, Mum's waiting.

42:51.292 --> 42:53.833
She gets so upset when she's away from me.

42:53.917 --> 42:57.375
She says every minute
is like an eternity so…

42:58.167 --> 43:00.667
Is she coming here? Can I meet her?

43:00.750 --> 43:02.208
Bye, Mrs. Phelps!

43:02.292 --> 43:04.583
Matilda, tomorrow I'm at the windmill.

43:04.667 --> 43:06.417
Okay, I'll find you.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.042
I've got it.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.125
-Harry! Let me have it!

43:18.083 --> 43:19.417
Hang on then.

43:22.375 --> 43:24.458
-You're hurting me!
-Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

43:28.417 --> 43:30.250
Let me pull, Harry.

43:30.333 --> 43:31.333
Pull then!

44:01.625 --> 44:02.458
Matilda.

44:05.958 --> 44:08.333
I believe your mind is extraordinary.

44:08.875 --> 44:11.500
So I'm taking things into my own hands.

44:12.625 --> 44:13.917
Starting tomorrow,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.500
I'm going to bring in a selection
of very clever books.

44:16.583 --> 44:19.083
You can sit and read them
while I teach the others,

44:19.167 --> 44:21.958
and if you have any questions, well…

44:22.042 --> 44:23.750
I shall do my best to answer them.

44:25.042 --> 44:26.250
How does that sound?

44:33.542 --> 44:34.708
Matilda…

44:36.167 --> 44:37.792
That is the biggest hug in the world.

44:39.125 --> 44:41.333
You're going to hug all the air out of me.

44:43.792 --> 44:45.833
What a touching little scene.

44:50.167 --> 44:51.042
Move!

44:51.750 --> 44:56.833
I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment.

44:56.917 --> 45:00.167
In fact, I seem to recall informing you

45:00.250 --> 45:05.917
that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate, did I not?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.625
No, Miss Trunchbull, Matilda is not--

45:07.708 --> 45:09.417
Did you just say "no," Jenny?

45:11.000 --> 45:11.833
To me?

45:14.792 --> 45:18.167
Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.042
This morning,

45:21.125 --> 45:25.417
a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen.

45:27.667 --> 45:31.292
It is my contention that you performed
this vileness, Wormwood, you.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.917
You have two choices,
admit your guilt and be punished,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.625
or call me a liar… and be punished.

45:39.917 --> 45:41.667
Think very carefully

45:41.750 --> 45:45.083
about what comes out
of your mouth, Wormwood.

45:45.667 --> 45:47.458
I did not stea--

46:21.875 --> 46:23.250
Chocolate.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.292
Bruce Bogtrotter.

46:28.458 --> 46:30.625
Yes, Miss Trunchbull?

46:32.083 --> 46:34.417
Thank you, Maurice, that will be all.

46:37.708 --> 46:41.958
Staff dismissed. Come on.
Everybody out. Everybody out, come on.

46:42.042 --> 46:42.958
Move!

46:55.125 --> 46:56.750
You liked my cake…

46:57.708 --> 46:58.833
didn't you, Bruce?

46:58.917 --> 47:02.000
Yes, Miss Trunchbull,
it was very delicious.

47:02.083 --> 47:03.542
So chocolatey.

47:04.125 --> 47:06.000
And I'm really very sorry, I--

47:06.083 --> 47:06.917
No, no…

47:07.792 --> 47:11.042
Just so long as you enjoyed the cake.
That's the main thing.

47:12.333 --> 47:13.167
Is it?

47:14.708 --> 47:16.250
Oh, Cook.

47:38.292 --> 47:39.125
Be still!

47:42.208 --> 47:44.500
What's the matter, Bogtrotter?
Lost your appetite?

47:45.042 --> 47:48.750
Don't worry… all you have to do
is eat every last crumb.

47:50.167 --> 47:54.125
And if you perform this incredible feat,
I promise you,

47:54.208 --> 47:56.042
all will be forgiven.

47:56.125 --> 47:58.042
Every crumb?

47:59.167 --> 48:01.333
-But I'm full.
-Oh, no, you're not full.

48:01.417 --> 48:04.792
I'll tell you when you're full.
And I say that criminals like you

48:04.875 --> 48:07.375
aren't full until they've
eaten the entire cake.

48:08.583 --> 48:11.458
-But--
-You haven't got time for "buts." Eat.

48:11.542 --> 48:13.042
But I can't eat it all.

48:13.125 --> 48:14.667
Headmistress, he'll be sick.

48:15.875 --> 48:18.458
He should have thought of that
before he made a pact with Satan

48:18.542 --> 48:20.375
and decided to steal my cake.

48:20.875 --> 48:22.708
-Eat.
-He can't!

48:22.792 --> 48:24.500
-Eat.
-He surely can't!

48:24.583 --> 48:26.292
-Eat!
-He might explode!

48:26.375 --> 48:27.583
Eat!

50:48.458 --> 50:52.375
Go on, Brucie!

50:55.625 --> 50:57.250
Uh… uh…

50:59.250 --> 51:02.417
Sorry, Miss Trunchbull, I…

51:02.500 --> 51:04.292
…got carried away.

51:04.375 --> 51:06.250
Oh, that's okay, Jenny.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.958
We all get carried away sometimes.

51:09.042 --> 51:09.875
Even me.

51:19.875 --> 51:22.167
Well, come along, Bogtrotter.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.750
-What?
-Oh, did I not mention?

51:25.500 --> 51:27.250
That was the first part
of your punishment, there's more.

51:27.333 --> 51:30.458
There's a second part,
and the second part is Chokey.

51:32.792 --> 51:34.875
Miss Trunchbull, please, you can't!
He's too young.

51:35.792 --> 51:37.958
But I ate it all. I did it. Please!

51:38.042 --> 51:39.875
Not that. Please!

51:39.958 --> 51:42.000
-No!

51:42.083 --> 51:44.917
You said if he ate
every crumb he'd be forgiven.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.167
He ate every crumb. We all saw it!

51:48.250 --> 51:50.208
He did it in front of everyone!

51:50.292 --> 51:52.208
You can't just change the rules.

51:52.292 --> 51:55.125
That's not right. It's cheating!

51:56.542 --> 51:58.000
You just said…

51:59.917 --> 52:00.833
"No."

52:02.292 --> 52:03.333
To me.

52:07.833 --> 52:09.542
-Come on, Bogtrotter.
-Please!

52:15.333 --> 52:16.583
-Come on!
-No!

52:16.667 --> 52:18.708
Wormwood will be dealt with in due course.

52:18.792 --> 52:21.458
As will the rest of these maggots.

52:21.542 --> 52:23.583
I ate it. I ate it all.

52:23.667 --> 52:25.625
No, please, Miss Trunchbull!

52:25.708 --> 52:27.250
Not the Chokey!

52:27.917 --> 52:29.042
I ate every crumb.

52:29.125 --> 52:30.667
Please!

52:30.750 --> 52:33.917
Not the Chokey! Please, not the Chokey!

52:37.708 --> 52:41.917
<i>You see, children, I will always win.</i>

52:42.000 --> 52:44.583
<i>And you will always lose.</i>

52:45.458 --> 52:49.542
<i>Because you are weak, tiny, titchy…</i>

52:50.125 --> 52:51.917
<i>and insignificant.</i>

56:28.792 --> 56:31.917
Mrs. Phelps! Where's the revenge section?

56:32.000 --> 56:36.250
Well, we don't have a revenge section.
Is it a bully?

56:36.833 --> 56:40.042
'Cause you know the best way
to deal with bullies is tell someone.

56:40.625 --> 56:43.292
Straight away. They thrive on silence.

56:43.875 --> 56:47.250
Tell a teacher.
Or better still, the headmistress.

56:48.208 --> 56:50.792
I think I've got the next part
of the story.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.167
But I shall warn you,

56:53.292 --> 56:54.667
it's about to get real.

56:58.708 --> 57:02.083
Slowly, the acrobat
tied her shiny white scarf

57:02.167 --> 57:03.750
around her husband's wrist.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.125
For luck, my love.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.542
Then she hugged him
with the biggest hug in the world.

57:10.625 --> 57:14.792
So hard that he felt that
she could hug all the air out of him.

57:17.333 --> 57:19.542
And so they prepared themselves

57:19.625 --> 57:23.125
for the most dangerous feat
that had ever been performed.

57:42.292 --> 57:46.167
The great escapologist had to somehow
escape from the padlocks,

57:46.250 --> 57:51.625
break free from the cage, and attempt
to rescue his wife within 12 seconds.

57:51.708 --> 57:54.458
Or she would be blown to bits!

58:09.542 --> 58:14.000
The moment the fuse was lit,
the acrobat swung into the air.

58:14.083 --> 58:16.292
-One second, two seconds…

58:16.375 --> 58:17.875
…the crowd held their breath

58:17.958 --> 58:22.958
as she swung higher and higher
above the sharks and spiky objects!

58:23.042 --> 58:25.167
Three seconds, four seconds.

58:25.250 --> 58:27.667
The evil sister looked on gleefully.

58:27.750 --> 58:30.042
-Five seconds, six seconds.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.250
The escapologist
couldn't take his eyes from his wife

58:32.333 --> 58:34.458
as he struggled in his chains,

58:34.542 --> 58:37.458
knowing that the tiniest, weeniest mistake

58:37.542 --> 58:40.417
would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever.

58:41.042 --> 58:43.125
Seven seconds, and suddenly…

58:43.208 --> 58:45.458
-She let go!

58:49.250 --> 58:52.292
The escapologist reached out
with one huge, massive arm

58:52.375 --> 58:53.625
to catch his wife and the child.

58:55.500 --> 58:57.333
-Eight seconds!
-No, I can't look.

58:57.417 --> 59:00.542
Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…

59:01.208 --> 59:04.583
And… And… Eleven seconds!

59:04.667 --> 59:09.333
He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far, far away!

59:09.417 --> 59:13.333
Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all.

59:14.167 --> 59:15.000
No.

59:16.667 --> 59:17.583
No, it doesn't.

59:30.875 --> 59:34.042
No! Was she okay? Did she survive?

59:34.625 --> 59:37.292
She broke every bone in her body.

59:37.958 --> 59:40.167
Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers.

59:41.125 --> 59:44.042
She did manage to live long enough
to have their child.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.625
But the effort was too great.

59:51.208 --> 59:52.833
Love our girl.

59:54.500 --> 59:58.042
Love our daughter with all your heart.

59:59.667 --> 1:00:02.458
She is all we ever wanted.

1:00:12.708 --> 1:00:13.875
And then she died.

1:00:16.708 --> 1:00:17.750
And then…

1:00:18.750 --> 1:00:20.125
things got worse.

1:00:20.208 --> 1:00:21.750
What? Worse?

1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:23.417
I'm afraid they did.

1:00:23.500 --> 1:00:25.875
Because the escapologist was so kind

1:00:25.958 --> 1:00:30.042
that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened.

1:00:30.917 --> 1:00:35.708
In fact, he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter.

1:00:35.792 --> 1:00:38.167
<i> No, no,</i>
<i>don't ask her to move in.</i>

1:00:38.250 --> 1:00:40.500
She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl,

1:00:40.583 --> 1:00:43.708
making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting,

1:00:43.792 --> 1:00:46.208
"Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"

1:00:46.292 --> 1:00:49.458
When the little girl did clean it,
she was even crueler

1:00:49.542 --> 1:00:52.417
because she was
a terrible, terrible cheat!

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:53.625
I hate cheats!

1:00:53.708 --> 1:00:57.667
All in secret, so the escapologist
never suspected a thing.

1:00:57.750 --> 1:01:00.750
And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest, cruelest,

1:01:00.833 --> 1:01:03.875
horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!

1:01:03.958 --> 1:01:06.042
Let's call the police!

1:01:07.042 --> 1:01:08.208
Mrs. Phelps.

1:01:09.125 --> 1:01:10.667
It's just a story.

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:12.125
What?

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:16.708
Oh. Yes, of course.

1:01:17.375 --> 1:01:18.375
A story.

1:01:19.167 --> 1:01:21.500
It's just, you make it so real.

1:01:22.375 --> 1:01:24.083
Your mind, Matilda.

1:01:24.583 --> 1:01:28.042
Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you.

1:01:28.667 --> 1:01:30.708
Oh… they do.

1:01:31.667 --> 1:01:33.250
They're always saying that.

1:01:33.333 --> 1:01:35.833
In fact, they say,

1:01:35.917 --> 1:01:39.500
"We're so proud of you, Matilda,
you're like winning the…"

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:45.750
Yeah. I'd better go.

1:01:50.625 --> 1:01:53.833
It's just like winning the lottery!

1:01:53.917 --> 1:01:54.917
What?

1:01:55.542 --> 1:01:56.708
Me?

1:01:56.792 --> 1:01:59.250
You? No, you're like
eating someone else's bogeys.

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:01.583
Like winning a snottery, you, boy.

1:02:01.667 --> 1:02:02.708
I'm a girl.

1:02:02.792 --> 1:02:04.542
But how, Harry?

1:02:04.625 --> 1:02:06.208
Remember that big, muscly idiot?

1:02:06.292 --> 1:02:08.958
Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates.

1:02:09.042 --> 1:02:10.625
Bucketloads of cash.

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:13.042
Everyone wanting a luxury car.

1:02:13.125 --> 1:02:17.292
All I had was a load of old bangers,
each with 100,000 miles on the clock.

1:02:17.375 --> 1:02:20.375
So, I did what any decent
business leader would.

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:21.500
What?

1:02:21.583 --> 1:02:22.875
I bought a drill.

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:26.875
Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse.

1:02:26.958 --> 1:02:29.417
I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:33.083
and sold them to those big,
muscly idiots, resulting in…

1:02:33.167 --> 1:02:34.875
Money!

1:02:34.958 --> 1:02:36.083
But you cheated them!

1:02:37.417 --> 1:02:38.333
Excuse me?

1:02:38.417 --> 1:02:41.875
You cheated them.
What you did, it wasn't right.

1:02:41.958 --> 1:02:43.417
You're just a cheat!

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.375
Oh, the little pig!

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:50.875
It's the books, Harry.
It's the books and the stories.

1:02:50.958 --> 1:02:52.250
Is it now?

1:02:53.125 --> 1:02:53.958
Books, is it?

1:02:56.750 --> 1:02:58.500
You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.583
I'm going to go down to that library,

1:03:01.375 --> 1:03:05.750
I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again.

1:03:05.833 --> 1:03:07.125
What?

1:03:07.208 --> 1:03:10.000
Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:14.875
You nasty little creep!

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:27.667
That night, the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep.

1:03:27.750 --> 1:03:31.458
She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying.

1:03:31.542 --> 1:03:33.875
She didn't want to add
to her father's pain.

1:03:34.583 --> 1:03:38.083
This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties,

1:03:38.167 --> 1:03:41.500
until one day she exploded.

1:03:42.250 --> 1:03:45.042
Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!

1:03:45.125 --> 1:03:47.458
You nasty little creep!

1:03:47.542 --> 1:03:50.667
And she threw her…
threw her into a dank,

1:03:50.750 --> 1:03:54.292
dark, dusty cellar,
locked the door and went out.

1:03:57.417 --> 1:04:01.083
But that night, the escapologist
happened to come home early.

1:04:02.667 --> 1:04:05.542
<i>And when he heard the sound</i>
<i>of his daughter's tears,</i>

1:04:05.625 --> 1:04:08.000
-he smashed the door open.

1:04:55.958 --> 1:04:58.458
Have I been
so wrapped up in my grief

1:04:58.542 --> 1:05:00.375
that I've forgotten the thing
that matters most?

1:05:00.958 --> 1:05:03.750
I love you so much, my daughter.

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:07.083
I shall spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

1:05:59.667 --> 1:06:01.833
<i>But when the little girl slept,</i>

1:06:01.917 --> 1:06:05.625
<i>the escapologist's thoughts</i>
<i>turned to the evil stepsister</i>

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:08.750
<i>and a mighty rage</i>
<i>grew inside his great heart!</i>

1:06:09.333 --> 1:06:11.708
This demon, this monster.

1:06:11.792 --> 1:06:13.625
Bullying children is her game, is it?

1:06:14.292 --> 1:06:16.583
<i>And as the unfairness</i>
<i>of the aunt's cruelty</i>

1:06:16.667 --> 1:06:18.583
<i>spun around inside him,</i>

1:06:18.667 --> 1:06:22.458
<i>it swirled and whirled</i>
<i>into a great storm of fury</i>

1:06:22.542 --> 1:06:25.167
that his mind could no longer contain.

1:06:32.292 --> 1:06:35.125
<i>And that was the last</i>
<i>the little girl ever saw of him.</i>

1:06:36.583 --> 1:06:40.583
Because he never came home, ever again.

1:06:54.542 --> 1:06:56.292
<i>Can you do telekenipsis?</i>

1:06:56.875 --> 1:06:58.958
<i>It's where you have loads of brains.</i>

1:06:59.042 --> 1:07:00.875
<i>They squish out through your eyes</i>

1:07:00.958 --> 1:07:03.333
<i>and you can move things with your mind.</i>

1:07:17.542 --> 1:07:20.333
Matilda. This is for you.

1:07:23.417 --> 1:07:24.417
Thank you.

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:27.417
Matilda, here you are.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.292
Isn't it a splendid day, old pal?

1:07:36.375 --> 1:07:39.542
-Lavender, what is going on?
-You, you're a hero.

1:07:39.625 --> 1:07:40.750
Here, Matilda.

1:07:42.083 --> 1:07:44.292
Egg and cress, Stephanie? Really!

1:07:45.917 --> 1:07:47.083
A hero?

1:07:47.167 --> 1:07:49.583
Yes. You're leading a revolution.

1:07:49.667 --> 1:07:52.833
-What revolution?
-You said "no" to The Trunchbull.

1:07:52.917 --> 1:07:55.000
See, no one's done that before.

1:07:58.917 --> 1:08:00.875
<i>You're leading a revolution.</i>

1:08:00.958 --> 1:08:02.625
<i>You said "no" to The Trunchbull.</i>

1:08:03.292 --> 1:08:04.958
<i>No one's done that before.</i>

1:08:10.875 --> 1:08:12.208
Ready for a little fun?

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:13.542
Yeah!

1:08:13.625 --> 1:08:15.417
-Fun?

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:17.250
Did you say "fun"?

1:08:23.167 --> 1:08:26.458
It is not our job
to make things fun.

1:08:26.542 --> 1:08:30.500
We are not here to encourage or nurture.

1:08:30.583 --> 1:08:33.250
We are here to crush them until…

1:08:34.333 --> 1:08:36.375
the wriggling stops.

1:08:36.458 --> 1:08:40.750
Well, I… I don't actually
believe that… that the--

1:08:40.833 --> 1:08:44.750
D-d-d-do you, Jenny?
D-d-d-do you think anyone c-c-c-cares?

1:08:45.917 --> 1:08:49.042
This class is full of rebels,

1:08:49.625 --> 1:08:52.458
and they need a real lesson.

1:08:53.042 --> 1:08:55.917
Bring your gym gear
and change on the way.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.333
You see, Jenny,

1:08:57.417 --> 1:09:00.458
to teach the child, we must first break…

1:09:01.458 --> 1:09:02.583
the child.

1:09:41.542 --> 1:09:43.042
Come along, squits.

1:09:43.125 --> 1:09:45.042
I'll take it from here, Jenny!

1:11:32.917 --> 1:11:34.708
<i>What a champion!</i>

1:11:34.792 --> 1:11:36.958
<i>Agatha Trunchbull, has done it again!</i>

1:11:37.042 --> 1:11:39.708
<i>What an athlete, what a winner!</i>

1:12:39.042 --> 1:12:40.917
She's mad.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:49.250
Right. Let's get you out.

1:13:51.625 --> 1:13:53.458
This isn't teaching!

1:13:53.542 --> 1:13:55.500
This is cruelty.

1:13:57.208 --> 1:13:59.250
Cruelty? Well, yes. Of course.

1:13:59.333 --> 1:14:00.333
-Go on, boy.

1:14:00.417 --> 1:14:02.125
You did say it was going to be fun.

1:14:03.792 --> 1:14:05.708
But-- but this isn't fun!

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.875
Miss Honey, you are pathetic!

1:14:09.708 --> 1:14:11.083
You are… weak

1:14:12.667 --> 1:14:14.375
You are… wet.

1:14:14.875 --> 1:14:16.417
You are, in fact…

1:14:18.625 --> 1:14:20.542
…a sniveling little…

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:23.958
…newt.

1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:35.958
You!

1:14:37.417 --> 1:14:39.208
No. What? Me?

1:14:39.292 --> 1:14:42.583
No, no, I didn't. I didn't. No!

1:14:43.958 --> 1:14:45.167
Don't you pull his ears off.

1:14:45.250 --> 1:14:48.292
I have discovered, Miss Honey,

1:14:48.375 --> 1:14:49.958
through years of experimentation,

1:14:50.042 --> 1:14:52.667
that the ears of small boys
do not come off!

1:14:52.750 --> 1:14:55.125
-They stretch.

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:01.792
-Please!

1:15:01.875 --> 1:15:03.000
Leave him alone!

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:07.917
You stupid, horrible, bully!

1:15:14.958 --> 1:15:17.333
How dare you.

1:15:18.917 --> 1:15:22.875
You are not fit to be in this school.

1:15:25.167 --> 1:15:26.708
You are evil.

1:15:27.542 --> 1:15:30.125
I shall crush you. I shall pound you.

1:15:30.708 --> 1:15:35.042
I shall dissect you, madam.

1:18:12.750 --> 1:18:17.042
<i>-Are you listening, you revolting little--
</i>

1:18:17.125 --> 1:18:21.333
-You idiot! You revolting--

1:18:47.083 --> 1:18:50.083
…you revolting little bloodworm.

1:18:55.625 --> 1:18:57.458
This is the end of your rebellion.

1:18:58.083 --> 1:19:00.792
You have leapt through the gates of Hades.

1:19:00.875 --> 1:19:03.667
Do you hear? I am going to tear you apart.

1:19:04.542 --> 1:19:08.875
…horrible, repellent, disgusting,
nauseating…

1:19:12.958 --> 1:19:14.292
Who did that?

1:19:16.667 --> 1:19:18.833
A-are you all right, Miss Trunchbull?

1:19:19.708 --> 1:19:23.083
Oh! Oh…

1:19:23.167 --> 1:19:25.875
Oh, oh, oh.

1:19:27.792 --> 1:19:29.792
Oh God, the newt!

1:19:29.875 --> 1:19:34.542
It's-- it's-- it's in my--
it's in my knickers!

1:19:34.625 --> 1:19:39.792
It's in my knickers!

1:19:40.917 --> 1:19:45.458
I've got a newt in my knickers!

1:19:45.542 --> 1:19:48.792
Okay. That was odd.

1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:52.958
Right. Everyone, back to class.

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:59.125
And please, please keep your heads down
for the rest of the day.

1:20:01.833 --> 1:20:02.667
Matilda.

1:20:02.750 --> 1:20:04.417
I need to show you something.

1:20:06.125 --> 1:20:07.417
Watch, Miss Honey.

1:20:09.167 --> 1:20:11.292
Matilda, if Miss Trunchbull sees--

1:20:11.375 --> 1:20:12.792
Just watch. Please.

1:20:19.792 --> 1:20:21.750
-I-I think we should go, before--
-Wait.

1:20:59.708 --> 1:21:01.708
I moved it with my eyes.

1:21:03.542 --> 1:21:04.792
Am I strange?

1:21:08.708 --> 1:21:11.500
How do you fancy a… nice cup of tea?

1:21:23.292 --> 1:21:25.250
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that way. This way.

1:21:26.917 --> 1:21:30.292
What do you think it is?
This thing with my eyes.

1:21:31.042 --> 1:21:32.583
Well, what did it feel like?

1:21:34.042 --> 1:21:35.417
Felt like fizzing.

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:37.167
Fizzing.

1:21:38.125 --> 1:21:40.208
But not bad fizzing, good fizzing.

1:21:41.125 --> 1:21:42.208
Good fizzing.

1:21:43.083 --> 1:21:45.125
Good fizzing. Hm…

1:21:45.792 --> 1:21:47.958
Okay, let's see.

1:21:48.875 --> 1:21:52.500
I'm no expert because I'm not sure
there are experts in fizzing,

1:21:52.583 --> 1:21:56.292
but I think it has something to do
with that incredible mind of yours.

1:21:57.458 --> 1:22:00.292
You mean, there's no room in my head
for all my brains?

1:22:00.375 --> 1:22:02.625
So they have to squish out
through my eyes?

1:22:03.375 --> 1:22:06.583
Well, yes.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

1:22:09.250 --> 1:22:10.375
Well, here we are.

1:22:11.083 --> 1:22:12.125
Where are we?

1:22:19.917 --> 1:22:21.000
Wow.

1:22:21.083 --> 1:22:23.500
They pay teachers really badly.

1:22:24.875 --> 1:22:28.542
-Well, actually, yes, they do.

1:22:29.417 --> 1:22:31.292
But I'm poorer even than most.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.583
You see, my father died when I was young.

1:22:38.667 --> 1:22:42.042
Magnus was his name. He was so kind.

1:22:42.750 --> 1:22:46.125
But… when he was gone,

1:22:46.208 --> 1:22:48.708
my aunt became my legal guardian.

1:22:49.375 --> 1:22:54.208
And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine.

1:22:54.792 --> 1:22:58.375
Then when I became a teacher,
she presented me with a bill.

1:22:59.167 --> 1:23:00.542
She'd written everything down.

1:23:00.625 --> 1:23:04.958
Every teabag, every gas bill,
every tin of beans.

1:23:05.042 --> 1:23:08.750
She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny.

1:23:09.250 --> 1:23:10.083
Really?

1:23:10.167 --> 1:23:13.917
She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house.

1:23:14.875 --> 1:23:17.750
But did he really do that, Magnus,

1:23:17.833 --> 1:23:19.875
did he just give her his house?

1:23:20.917 --> 1:23:25.000
Well, I've always felt it was…
suspicious.

1:23:25.583 --> 1:23:28.917
You see, she said his death
was an accident, but…

1:23:30.583 --> 1:23:32.125
You think she did him in!

1:23:33.875 --> 1:23:36.875
Well, I cannot say for sure.

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:43.750
All I really know is that years of being
bullied by that woman made me, well…

1:23:45.208 --> 1:23:46.375
pathetic.

1:23:48.292 --> 1:23:52.125
Then one day, I came across this old shed.

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:54.708
I fell in love with it.

1:23:56.167 --> 1:23:59.292
I begged the farmer who owned it
to let me move in.

1:24:00.208 --> 1:24:02.500
He thought I was mad, but…

1:24:03.583 --> 1:24:05.417
he said "yes," and…

1:24:07.458 --> 1:24:09.167
And that's why you live here.

1:24:59.542 --> 1:25:01.375
But Miss Honey,
she's got your father's house.

1:25:01.458 --> 1:25:03.417
She's got everything that's yours.

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.625
Where did you get this scarf?

1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:44.667
Oh, it was my father's.

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:47.958
Mum gave it to him before she died.

1:27:48.042 --> 1:27:49.875
-She was an--
-An acrobat.

1:27:50.667 --> 1:27:53.917
Uh, well, yes, she was. She…

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.167
H-- How did you…

1:27:58.042 --> 1:28:00.625
-And my father was an esca--
-An escapologist.

1:28:01.375 --> 1:28:03.167
Matilda, how do you know that?

1:28:03.250 --> 1:28:05.458
So they were <i>your </i>parents.

1:28:05.542 --> 1:28:07.542
What? Who?

1:28:07.625 --> 1:28:09.000
The people in my story.

1:28:09.083 --> 1:28:11.125
I thought I was making it up,
but it's real!

1:28:11.208 --> 1:28:12.958
It's you, it's your life.

1:28:13.042 --> 1:28:15.292
Miss Honey, who's your aunt?

1:28:15.375 --> 1:28:19.417
Well, actually Matilda,
she's… my step-aunt.

1:28:20.208 --> 1:28:21.208
Miss Trunchbull!

1:28:21.292 --> 1:28:24.917
A contract is a contract is a contract
is a contract!

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:29.292
Matilda.

1:28:30.125 --> 1:28:31.125
Matilda, listen to me!

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.583
You must forget all this!
You need to be very careful.

1:28:36.333 --> 1:28:40.083
Miss Trunchbull has been humiliated,
and she is capable of awful things.

1:28:40.167 --> 1:28:41.750
I'm not scared of her.

1:28:41.833 --> 1:28:44.375
You should be. She's dangerous.

1:28:45.125 --> 1:28:46.583
So am I.

1:29:44.458 --> 1:29:45.625
"Rich," he said.

1:29:46.958 --> 1:29:48.667
"Bears," he said.

1:29:48.750 --> 1:29:51.542
Oh, "I'm a genius," he said.

1:29:51.625 --> 1:29:52.625
What's going on?

1:29:53.208 --> 1:29:54.750
Pack your bag, we're off to Spain.

1:29:55.875 --> 1:29:57.875
Spain? Why?

1:29:57.958 --> 1:30:00.792
Remember those big, stupid, muscly men

1:30:00.875 --> 1:30:03.125
your idiot of a father
sold them old bangers to?

1:30:03.208 --> 1:30:04.333
Come on, love…

1:30:04.417 --> 1:30:06.583
Turns out they was the flaming Mafia!

1:30:06.667 --> 1:30:09.000
And not so stupid after all.

1:30:09.083 --> 1:30:11.667
And they gave me 24 hours
to get them the money back.

1:30:11.750 --> 1:30:13.667
Only somebody already spent it.

1:30:14.250 --> 1:30:17.083
I'm getting some passports tomorrow.
So I'll pick you up from school.

1:30:17.167 --> 1:30:21.292
What about Mrs. Phelps,
Lavender, Nigel, Amanda?

1:30:21.375 --> 1:30:23.042
-What about Miss Honey?
-Forget 'em!

1:30:23.125 --> 1:30:25.375
After tomorrow,
you're never gonna see 'em again!

1:31:59.708 --> 1:32:02.708
<i> Yesterday an act</i>
<i>of vandalism took place in the woods.</i>

1:32:02.792 --> 1:32:04.708
<i>Now you've seen the consequences.</i>

1:32:04.792 --> 1:32:07.583
<i>You break my toys, I break yours.</i>

1:32:07.667 --> 1:32:10.208
<i>Miss Honey's class, canteen, now.</i>

1:32:11.292 --> 1:32:13.000
Come along, children. It'll be fine.

1:32:40.458 --> 1:32:41.500
Children…

1:32:43.125 --> 1:32:46.917
How can I be your headmistress

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.250
if I cannot chill you to the bone?

1:32:52.917 --> 1:32:53.750
Mm?

1:32:54.458 --> 1:32:57.958
If the small ones don't pee just a little

1:32:58.042 --> 1:33:00.167
when I walk into the room,
well then I'm…

1:33:01.042 --> 1:33:05.833
failing as an educator.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:09.875
So…

1:33:11.250 --> 1:33:13.792
Today we are going
to have a spelling test.

1:33:15.458 --> 1:33:21.875
And any child who gets one
single answer wrong…

1:33:23.083 --> 1:33:26.542
goes to Chokey.

1:33:26.625 --> 1:33:28.083
You can't do that!

1:33:29.292 --> 1:33:30.875
Oh, really? Why?

1:33:30.958 --> 1:33:33.167
Because of yesterday's little…

1:33:35.042 --> 1:33:37.000
…incident, you mean?

1:33:37.750 --> 1:33:40.208
Well, here's a surprise Chokey.

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:46.208
-You!

1:33:47.375 --> 1:33:49.042
Spell, oh, let me see…

1:33:49.625 --> 1:33:50.625
"newt."

1:33:50.708 --> 1:33:55.000
N-E-W-T. Newt.

1:33:56.667 --> 1:33:57.500
What?

1:33:58.375 --> 1:33:59.375
How do you know that?

1:33:59.458 --> 1:34:02.458
Miss Honey taught us.
She's very good at teaching.

1:34:03.917 --> 1:34:05.167
Nonsense!

1:34:05.250 --> 1:34:08.958
Miss Honey's far too soft and peachy

1:34:09.042 --> 1:34:10.792
to be good at anything!

1:34:10.875 --> 1:34:11.917
You!

1:34:12.875 --> 1:34:16.833
Spell the one thing you all are.

1:34:16.917 --> 1:34:19.875
Spell "revolting."

1:34:20.458 --> 1:34:24.333
Revolting. R-E-V-O-L-T…

1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:27.083
I-N-G. Revolting.

1:34:27.167 --> 1:34:29.083
You're cheating, pigtails!

1:34:29.167 --> 1:34:32.375
Of course she's not cheating!
She's simply spelling the word.

1:34:32.458 --> 1:34:34.750
I just taught them with kindness
and patience and respect.

1:34:34.833 --> 1:34:37.417
How dare you bring
those words into my classroom!

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.833
You. Snot-nose.

1:34:42.542 --> 1:34:43.792
Stand and spell…

1:34:45.417 --> 1:34:49.958
"amchellakamanialseptricolistimosis."

1:34:50.042 --> 1:34:51.917
But that's not even a word.

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:53.417
Spell it or go to Chokey.

1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:55.458
And I should warn you,
it has silent letters.

1:34:57.750 --> 1:34:58.583
A…

1:34:59.792 --> 1:35:00.625
M…

1:35:01.542 --> 1:35:02.625
C…

1:35:03.167 --> 1:35:04.083
H…

1:35:05.583 --> 1:35:06.542
E…

1:35:08.083 --> 1:35:09.083
L…

1:35:09.917 --> 1:35:10.833
L…

1:35:12.667 --> 1:35:13.625
A…

1:35:15.250 --> 1:35:16.375
Oh, dear…

1:35:17.208 --> 1:35:18.917
-Oh…
-K…

1:35:19.542 --> 1:35:22.458
I'm so sorry, it was a silent V.

1:35:22.542 --> 1:35:24.958
-You're going to Chokey!

1:35:25.875 --> 1:35:26.875
Cat!

1:35:27.375 --> 1:35:30.583
C-A-F. Cat.

1:35:31.208 --> 1:35:35.583
I got it wrong, Miss.
You have to put me in Chokey, too.

1:35:35.667 --> 1:35:40.000
-What?
-Dog. D-Y-P. Dog. And me.

1:35:40.917 --> 1:35:44.583
Table. X-A-B-F-Y. And me.

1:35:44.667 --> 1:35:46.875
Can't put us all in Chokey. Banana.

1:35:46.958 --> 1:35:50.917
G-T-A-A-B-L…

1:35:55.125 --> 1:35:56.125
Stop this!

1:36:20.125 --> 1:36:22.958
I've been busy!

1:36:24.542 --> 1:36:28.708
A Chokey for each and every one of you!

1:36:34.333 --> 1:36:36.333
-Get down!

1:36:39.250 --> 1:36:44.125
And now our little test is over,

1:36:44.708 --> 1:36:47.292
I can tell you that each

1:36:47.375 --> 1:36:51.167
and every one of you has failed.

1:36:52.292 --> 1:36:56.167
You see, there are winners and losers

1:36:56.250 --> 1:36:58.667
in this world, children.

1:36:59.583 --> 1:37:03.333
And I am a--

1:37:03.417 --> 1:37:05.625
The chalk! Look, the chalk!

1:37:05.708 --> 1:37:07.000
Huh?

1:37:08.583 --> 1:37:10.042
"Agatha…

1:37:10.583 --> 1:37:13.542
This is Magnus.

1:37:14.125 --> 1:37:17.250
Give my Jenny…

1:37:17.833 --> 1:37:21.500
back her house."

1:37:21.583 --> 1:37:24.208
Who's doing this? Who? Tell me now.

1:37:24.792 --> 1:37:26.833
No one's doing it. It's a ghost!

1:37:26.917 --> 1:37:29.667
"Then leave."

1:37:29.750 --> 1:37:30.875
Oh, no.

1:37:30.958 --> 1:37:34.042
"Or I will…

1:37:34.125 --> 1:37:36.458
get you…

1:37:36.542 --> 1:37:38.875
like you…

1:37:38.958 --> 1:37:41.000
got me!"

1:37:43.458 --> 1:37:44.875
You think me an idiot!

1:37:45.708 --> 1:37:49.542
It's a cheap trick
just like Magnus used to do!

1:37:51.833 --> 1:37:53.708
You can't hurt me.

1:37:54.292 --> 1:37:55.542
I hurt you!

1:37:55.625 --> 1:37:56.500
No!

1:37:58.333 --> 1:37:59.333
No.

1:38:17.375 --> 1:38:18.708
Oh!

1:38:25.083 --> 1:38:27.125
It can't be Magnus. It can't.

1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:32.667
Look! Matilda.

1:39:03.458 --> 1:39:07.667
You see! I'm not going anywhere!

1:39:12.417 --> 1:39:14.667
Oh, no. Stop.

1:39:14.750 --> 1:39:16.958
I say, what are you doing to my hair?

1:39:18.375 --> 1:39:21.250
Pigtails! No!

1:39:21.333 --> 1:39:22.333
No!

1:39:23.667 --> 1:39:26.208
I hate pigtails!

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:33.625
Stop it now! I'm ordering you!

1:39:36.167 --> 1:39:38.667
Let me down! Let me down!

1:39:39.625 --> 1:39:40.583
Let me down!

1:40:06.250 --> 1:40:07.500
It's over.

1:40:08.083 --> 1:40:09.500
This is my school now.

1:40:13.917 --> 1:40:14.958
Run.

1:41:06.667 --> 1:41:07.708
-Yes!

1:43:24.875 --> 1:43:25.708
Come on!

1:43:26.417 --> 1:43:28.083
We've got to go, boy.
We're going to be late!

1:43:28.167 --> 1:43:30.542
She's a-- Sorry, go?

1:43:30.625 --> 1:43:32.167
Spain. We're moving there.

1:43:32.250 --> 1:43:33.917
We've got a plane to catch in 40 minutes.

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.250
Oi! Say your goodbyes now!

1:43:37.333 --> 1:43:38.917
No, Matilda. You can't.

1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:40.125
-No way.
-Don't leave us.

1:43:42.750 --> 1:43:44.792
It's not up to me.

1:43:57.875 --> 1:43:59.083
Thank you.

1:44:03.625 --> 1:44:04.500
Come on.

1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:07.208
Chop flaming chop.

1:44:09.125 --> 1:44:10.833
Right. In you go.

1:44:10.917 --> 1:44:12.167
Where do I go?

1:44:12.250 --> 1:44:14.792
It can go in the back, Harry.
It's got them clingy fingers.

1:44:14.875 --> 1:44:17.000
What, you can't just stick him
in the back.

1:44:17.083 --> 1:44:18.417
Let Matilda stay here with me.

1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.000
Mr. Wormwood,
I would love to take Matilda.

1:44:24.083 --> 1:44:25.500
I beg your pardon?

1:44:25.583 --> 1:44:28.125
If she'd like to stay with me, that is.

1:44:28.208 --> 1:44:33.042
I would look after her with love
and respect and care and…

1:44:34.667 --> 1:44:36.333
I'd pay for everything.

1:44:38.375 --> 1:44:40.042
Would you like that, Matilda?

1:44:41.333 --> 1:44:42.708
-Hang on!
-Harry!

1:44:43.708 --> 1:44:46.708
You want us to leave our daughter
here with you?

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:50.625
What did you just call me?

1:44:50.708 --> 1:44:52.875
We are going to miss the plane!

1:44:52.958 --> 1:44:56.542
Did you just call me… your daughter?

1:44:57.250 --> 1:44:59.667
If… if that's what she wants.

1:45:03.667 --> 1:45:06.208
Well? Is that what you want?

1:45:06.792 --> 1:45:09.375
You want to…
stay here with Miss Honey?

1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:11.417
Yes.

1:45:14.292 --> 1:45:16.250
Yes, I… yes, I do.

1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:21.083
And you want to look after her?

1:45:22.458 --> 1:45:23.917
I do. Yes.

1:45:31.125 --> 1:45:32.625
We are a bit short of room.

1:45:34.625 --> 1:45:35.583
Yeah.

1:45:36.208 --> 1:45:37.417
Yeah, all right.

1:45:38.417 --> 1:45:39.500
Yeah.

1:45:46.542 --> 1:45:47.542
Thank you.

1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.000
Harry!

1:46:13.292 --> 1:46:15.375
Please!

1:46:16.750 --> 1:46:19.667
She did it.

1:46:19.750 --> 1:46:21.625
-Lovely, right.

1:46:32.708 --> 1:46:35.167
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

1:46:35.250 --> 1:46:37.833
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

1:46:37.917 --> 1:46:41.292
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

1:48:36.833 --> 1:48:40.917
-Careful. Left a bit. Left a bit.

1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:45.625
-Perfect!
