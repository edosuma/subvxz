stronger like an ice pick lobotomy,

Here, you're number 15.

12:56.806 --> 12:59.651
Out there, could be hundreds, thousands.

13:00.042 --> 13:03.076
It's a genetic mutation that
lies dormant through adolescence.

13:03.078 --> 13:04.643
Sometimes it never breaks out.

13:04.645 --> 13:08.748

You, my friend, are a Homo superior.

You heard of the five finger discount?

13:36.942 --> 13:40.945
We get the no finger discount.

13:40.947 --> 13:44.048
Hey, you want to learn how
to be a telekinetic klepto,

13:44.050 --> 13:46.150
or do you want to learn how to stay alive?

13:48.153 --> 13:50.720
These are two of our newest breakouts.

13:50.722 --> 13:52.655
When they arrived, they were just like you,

13:52.657 --> 13:54.657
unable to control their powers.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.831
Teleporting in your sleep
is just the beginning.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.766
It's kind of like a paranormal dream.

14:03.768 --> 14:05.335
By the time we're done with your training,

14:05.337 --> 14:07.769
Ultra won't be able to lay a hand on you.

14:07.771 --> 14:08.904
Show off.

14:08.906 --> 14:11.307
Who's Ultra?

14:11.374 --> 14:13.007
The ones hunting us.

14:13.009 --> 14:15.876
There is a war going on out there, Stephen.

14:15.878 --> 14:18.145
You won't read about it
or see it on the news.

14:18.147 --> 14:20.080
A shadow war between our species.

14:22.216 --> 14:24.984
<i>CARA: The government's
known about us for years.</i>

14:24.986 --> 14:26.386
<i>They want us neutralized.</i>

14:26.388 --> 14:29.022
<i>That's why they started
a containment program.</i>

<i>Captured, then forced to use their powers</i>

14:37.388 --> 14:38.541
to hunt the rest of us down.

14:38.732 --> 14:39.864
Have a seat.

14:39.866 --> 14:41.133
I can explain. I said sit.

You had John, you lost John, end of story.

That's not why you're here.

to do things the old-fashioned way.

a place that only we can reach.

16:54.325 --> 16:55.992
He never came back.

16:55.994 --> 16:57.961
Okay, so Ultra got him.

16:57.963 --> 16:58.995
It's impossible.

17:00.097 --> 17:01.331
He was the strongest of us all.

He was more than that.

contact him, it's gonna be you.

17:36.099 --> 17:37.832
What if I don't want to find him?

17:37.834 --> 17:39.367
He bailed on us, okay?

17:39.369 --> 17:42.369
The same way he bailed on you.
He left my mom and two little kids

17:42.371 --> 17:44.938
and a stack of bills
from some psych hospital.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.841
Stephen, he left so that
you could have a life.

17:47.843 --> 17:50.377
So you'd be safe from Ultra,
so that you could grow up human.

17:51.879 --> 17:53.247
If it weren't for him,

17:53.249 --> 17:54.781
you'd be in a cage right now,

apart like a lab rat.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.583
Okay? They just want to be left alone.

27:09.585 --> 27:11.751
You have no idea what
this world would look like

27:11.753 --> 27:14.054
if I didn't find people like you

27:14.056 --> 27:15.755
and stop people like you.

27:19.860 --> 27:22.129
Look at this. We just found a 17-year-old

27:22.131 --> 27:25.065
who stole $70 million
from the Federal Reserve.

27:25.067 --> 27:29.601
You got a 16-year-old who was
caught trying to tag the Oval Office.

27:29.603 --> 27:32.938
An 18-year-old who was caught
tweeting nuclear launch codes.

27:34.974 --> 27:38.610
And so many breakouts, Stephen.
It's all over the world.

27:38.612 --> 27:40.913
Unpredictable... uncontrollable... 

27:42.882 --> 27:44.582
I'm not the bad guy here, Stephen.

27:45.651 --> 27:46.851
Not by a long shot.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.793
Can I help you?

27:55.795 --> 27:57.828
- (ALARM WAILING)
- I'm gonna need to see some...

28:00.965 --> 28:01.998
(GRUNTING)

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Freeze!

28:04.002 --> 28:04.968
Aah!

28:09.541 --> 28:10.640
I got him.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.048
No one is going to hurt you.

28:19.050 --> 28:21.317
Actually, this might
hurt just a little bit.

28:21.319 --> 28:23.319
What is it?

28:23.321 --> 28:25.788
Well, I could give you a boring
lecture about recombinant DNA therapy,

28:25.790 --> 28:27.957
but the short story is, this will fix you.

28:27.959 --> 28:29.807
Return you to the way you used to be.

28:29.808 --> 28:31.120
There's nothing wrong with me!

28:35.698 --> 28:36.998
Shh.

28:38.433 --> 28:40.568
You're so much like your father.

28:40.570 --> 28:42.224
So much promise.

28:42.225 --> 28:44.341
But you don't want to
end up like him, do you?

28:45.641 --> 28:49.110
I don't know what myths John has
spun about who your father is,

28:49.112 --> 28:51.095
- but they're not true.
- Yeah?

28:51.096 --> 28:53.014
And I'm supposed to believe you?

28:53.248 --> 28:55.115
Well, you can believe whatever you want.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.735
But your father's not coming back
to save you or the Tomorrow People.

28:59.803 --> 29:01.103
Because he's dead.

29:02.239 --> 29:03.239
What?

29:04.808 --> 29:05.908
JEDIKIAH: Come on.

29:08.144 --> 29:10.079
No! No!

29:10.081 --> 29:12.647
- (DOOR OPENING)
- Sir! There's been a breach.

29:16.352 --> 29:19.187
Well, your friends are
coming to rescue you.

29:19.189 --> 29:22.056
- That's one way to get them out of hiding.
- No.

29:23.192 --> 29:24.793
No.

29:24.795 --> 29:25.927
No. No.

29:40.042 --> 29:42.643
Our powers don't work here.

29:42.645 --> 29:43.911
Neither do theirs.

29:49.217 --> 29:51.651
<i>STEPHEN: Cara, get out of here. Please.</i>

30:26.953 --> 30:29.224
I was wondering when you
were going to show up.

30:29.225 --> 30:30.225
No, you weren't.

30:31.323 --> 30:33.857
Don't worry about me, guys. I'm good.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.397
(STRAINING)

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
Whoa.

31:03.253 --> 31:04.353
This way.

31:04.355 --> 31:06.355
- Wait, how did you...
- I teleported.

31:06.357 --> 31:07.690
That's impossible.

31:12.362 --> 31:13.662
John.

31:23.739 --> 31:26.040
So you've decided to come home.

31:26.042 --> 31:29.176
Did you think he was gonna help
you find your promised land?

31:29.178 --> 31:30.912
Is that it?

31:30.914 --> 31:32.129
It doesn't exist.

31:32.130 --> 31:33.136
And even if it did,

31:34.101 --> 31:35.686
you're sure as hell never gonna see it.

31:36.385 --> 31:37.384
No!

31:49.998 --> 31:52.264
Stephen, how are you doing that?

31:53.667 --> 31:54.901
STEPHEN: I don't know.

31:59.072 --> 32:01.040
Get us out.

32:01.042 --> 32:02.041
Now!

32:19.520 --> 32:22.104
Those are some serious
next-level skills you broke out.

32:22.730 --> 32:25.499
And here we thought
there were just three T's.

32:25.501 --> 32:26.378
How'd you do it, man?

32:26.379 --> 32:28.212
And, more importantly,
what are we calling it?

32:28.769 --> 32:30.403
No idea. It just happened.

32:30.405 --> 32:32.605
And that is why your training begins now.

32:32.607 --> 32:35.341
I mean, what else can you do besides... 

32:35.343 --> 32:36.642
stop time.

32:36.644 --> 32:39.612
(CHUCKLES) Uh, just give me one minute.

32:39.614 --> 32:41.414
Okay? There's something I gotta do. Just... 

32:42.616 --> 32:46.051
JOHN: You were right. He is special.

32:46.053 --> 32:48.286
But can he find his father?

32:48.288 --> 32:50.488
John, you saw what he did.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.092
When none of us could
use any of our powers.

32:53.094 --> 32:55.127
What if Stephen could
lead us there himself?

32:55.129 --> 32:57.196
All right, I get it. He's Moses.

32:57.198 --> 32:59.198
You're giving me a complex.

32:59.200 --> 33:03.167
- Don't be jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

33:03.169 --> 33:04.435
Should I be?

33:06.338 --> 33:08.106
Thank you.

33:08.108 --> 33:09.423
For coming to help us.

33:09.424 --> 33:11.541
I didn't mean what I
said, I was being a dick.

33:11.577 --> 33:14.511
- I know.
- I'd never let you get hurt.

33:14.513 --> 33:16.180
I know.

33:24.756 --> 33:29.692
- (DOOR CLOSING)
- Excuse me, um, whatever your name is.

33:29.784 --> 33:31.251
<i>TIM: Hello, Stephen.</i>

33:32.386 --> 33:35.821
Uh, I was hoping I could ask a favor.

33:35.823 --> 33:38.108
<i>You'd like to see the rest
of your father's message.</i>

33:38.109 --> 33:39.975
Yeah. How'd you know?

33:40.494 --> 33:43.395
<i>People are predicable. Even ones like you.</i>

33:48.134 --> 33:51.402
<i>JACK: (ON MONITOR) I thought
maybe you'd get lucky.</i>

33:51.404 --> 33:53.471
<i>Take after your mom.</i>

33:53.473 --> 33:55.354
<i>But if you're watching this, well,</i>

33:55.355 --> 33:56.967
things didn't turn out
the way that I hoped.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.711
<i>And... I know I have no
right to offer you advice.</i>

34:02.414 --> 34:04.615
<i>Not after what I'm about to do.</i>

34:04.617 --> 34:06.711
<i>But, if you turned out like me,</i>

34:06.712 --> 34:09.183
then your life just got very complicated.

34:10.654 --> 34:12.422
<i>And very dangerous.</i>

34:16.327 --> 34:19.228
<i>Don't believe everything you see.</i>

34:19.231 --> 34:23.465
<i>The truth is, there's only
one thing you can trust.</i>

34:23.467 --> 34:24.565
<i>You.</i>

34:27.536 --> 34:28.704
<i>Trust your heart, son.</i>

34:30.373 --> 34:31.706
<i>I love you, Stephen.</i>

34:35.178 --> 34:36.478
<i>I love you.</i>

34:40.416 --> 34:42.117
What do you think, supercomputer?

34:43.319 --> 34:45.152
What do you think? Is he alive?

34:46.422 --> 34:48.822
<i>TIM: I wish I knew the
answer to that, Stephen.</i>

35:03.471 --> 35:05.505
JOHN: You want me to stick around? Or... 

35:05.507 --> 35:07.507
STEPHEN: When I come home
from being gone all night?

35:07.509 --> 35:11.377
Trust me, you don't want any part of this.

35:11.379 --> 35:15.048
For the record, I haven't forgotten
about how you saved my life.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.717
You're welcome.

35:18.719 --> 35:21.253
The thing is, Stephen... 

35:21.255 --> 35:24.256
one day you might be the
one who saves all of us.

35:24.258 --> 35:25.524
(PULSING)

35:31.331 --> 35:34.365
I'm sorry I didn't call, okay?
I know this looks really bad.

35:34.367 --> 35:37.569
It doesn't matter. Look, we have a visitor.

35:46.679 --> 35:49.145
Your father has a brother.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.415
Jedikiah. This is your uncle.

35:52.417 --> 35:55.786
- What?
- Hi, Stephen. Call me Jed.

36:02.924 --> 36:06.012
It's... weird, I know,
but we did meet once.

36:06.375 --> 36:07.665
You were in diapers.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.877
Uncle Jed and your
father had a falling out.

36:10.014 --> 36:11.880
Right before Luca was born.

36:11.882 --> 36:15.317
And as I was saying, it's been really
hard tracking the three of you down.

36:15.319 --> 36:19.420
It was like you guys
just up and... vanished.

36:19.422 --> 36:20.989
Yeah, well... 

36:22.190 --> 36:23.691
we needed a fresh start.

36:26.629 --> 36:29.597
Mom, do you think you
could give us a minute?

36:29.599 --> 36:33.334
- Just to get to know one another?
- MARLA: Sure.

36:33.336 --> 36:34.968
I'll be upstairs.

36:37.071 --> 36:38.404
Nice to see you.

36:40.975 --> 36:44.077
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Reuniting my family.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.378
You're not my family.

36:48.716 --> 36:51.450
That's your dad and I.

36:51.452 --> 36:54.754
Only I was born human
and he was born like you.

36:54.756 --> 36:57.056
The whole reason I became a geneticist

36:57.058 --> 36:59.591
was to understand him and
perhaps one day help him.

37:01.128 --> 37:04.096
Work for me, Stephen.

37:04.098 --> 37:06.528
Clearly, I underestimated you.

37:06.529 --> 37:08.260
We've only just glimpsed
what you're capable of.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.268
If you let me help you hone your skills... 

37:10.270 --> 37:13.638
Ultra hunts down people like me.
Why would I want to help them?

37:13.640 --> 37:14.973
For them.

37:15.975 --> 37:17.275
Your family.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.026
- Are you threatening them?
- No, you're threatening them

37:20.030 --> 37:22.913
if you don't help me contain
the spread of your species.

37:22.915 --> 37:24.983
Can't you see I'm
offering you an opportunity

37:24.984 --> 37:26.280
to protect the people you love?

37:26.285 --> 37:28.152
- Yeah, and to be a traitor.
- To whom?

37:28.154 --> 37:31.055
Some rebel runaways you met
two days ago? Or to your mother?

37:32.123 --> 37:33.290
Your brother.

37:34.458 --> 37:35.592
Your friend.

37:37.995 --> 37:40.296
Astrid, is it?

37:40.298 --> 37:42.165
Therapy records.

37:42.167 --> 37:44.400
Very illuminating.

37:44.402 --> 37:49.172
Sooner or later, Stephen, you
are going to have to pick a side.

37:49.174 --> 37:52.742
JEDIKIAH: Your new friends want you
to believe that your father's a hero.

37:52.744 --> 37:54.342
That he's still alive.

37:56.579 --> 37:59.081
JEDIKIAH: They lied to you.

37:59.083 --> 38:00.071
That's your dad.

38:00.072 --> 38:03.231
After he broke into my office
and sabotaged my research.

38:08.390 --> 38:11.358
You don't want that to happen to you.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.393
Work with me, Stephen.

38:13.395 --> 38:15.295
Come be an agent at Ultra.

38:19.434 --> 38:23.170
So, we have an uncle Jedikiah?

38:23.172 --> 38:26.405
- LUCA: That's a little random.
- You must be Luca.

38:26.407 --> 38:29.675
I hear you inherited your
father's athletic genes.

38:29.677 --> 38:31.177
Hope that's all I got.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.647
Yes. Let's hope.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.367
Why didn't you tell me
Jedikiah was my uncle?

38:55.369 --> 38:58.636
You and John... you
played me from the start.

38:58.638 --> 39:00.872
Technically, you're related,

39:00.873 --> 39:02.721
but you are not like
him, you are one of us.

39:02.725 --> 39:05.559
- He asked me to come work for him.
- He's using you.

39:05.561 --> 39:07.895
What's the worst that'll happen
if we all turn ourselves in,

39:07.897 --> 39:10.597
give up our powers, and
live like human beings?

39:10.599 --> 39:13.146
You want us to admit that we're mistakes?

39:13.147 --> 39:15.396
Nature doesn't make mistakes.

39:15.737 --> 39:18.060
Jedikiah would drive us extinct.

39:18.061 --> 39:19.754
Just for the sake of the human race.

39:19.757 --> 39:23.793
Which, I'm sorry, I still
consider myself a part of.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.799
Of course you do.

39:31.534 --> 39:34.670
But to them, you're not.

39:35.938 --> 39:39.508
I know you have a life here.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.775
A family.

39:40.777 --> 39:42.911
But the people who are like us?

39:42.913 --> 39:44.901
The ones we found? The ones we will find?

39:44.902 --> 39:46.848
They are my family.

39:47.883 --> 39:50.518
I'm not gonna let anything happen to them.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.987
And I won't let anything happen to you.

39:53.989 --> 39:55.690
Now, please, Stephen.

39:57.759 --> 39:58.892
Just come with me.

40:04.131 --> 40:07.467
You know, when you first
started talking to me... 

40:07.469 --> 40:08.962
the mysterious voice in my head.

40:08.963 --> 40:11.181
Even when I thought I was crazy...

40:11.906 --> 40:13.406
I trusted you.

40:14.775 --> 40:17.410
I have to find out what
happened to my dad, okay?

40:17.412 --> 40:22.047
Whether or not he's a hero,
if he's alive, I have to know.

40:22.049 --> 40:25.651
But there's only one way I can find
him without losing everyone else.

40:25.653 --> 40:27.953
Now, I know you're gonna think
I'm crazy for doing this... 

40:27.955 --> 40:31.657
Stephen, you have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

40:31.659 --> 40:32.758
Cara.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.060
It's your turn to trust me.

41:01.753 --> 41:03.754
<i>My name is Stephen Jameson.</i>

41:05.757 --> 41:07.790
<i>This is where I go to school.</i>

41:12.462 --> 41:14.430
<i>These are my friends.</i>

41:16.400 --> 41:18.367
What happened?

41:18.369 --> 41:20.369
Stephen made his decision.

41:23.572 --> 41:25.407
<i>This is where I work.</i>

41:31.681 --> 41:34.783
<i>And this is my new boss.</i>

41:43.725 --> 41:45.693
I'm in.

41:45.695 --> 41:47.460
Welcome aboard, Stephen.

41:54.535 --> 41:58.371
<i>- CARA: I hope you know what you're doing.
- STEPHEN: Yeah. Me too.</i>
