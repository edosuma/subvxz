Denial, anger, compromise, depression and acceptance.

34:36.350 --> 34:37.889
The five stages of death.

34:37.889 --> 34:40.389
After all, I’ve been here for years. I know it well.

34:40.389 --> 34:42.360
People usually start with denial.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.190
But he’s already depressed.

34:44.190 --> 34:46.230
Is it because he’s a doctor?

34:46.230 --> 34:49.000
Sure enough, he’s different from the rest.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.370
He’s quick and cold.

34:50.370 --> 34:53.540
That’s why I told you not to mention God very often.

34:53.540 --> 34:56.610
Who knows what God will do with you?

34:56.340 --> 34:58.370
[Intensive Care Unit]

34:58.540 --> 34:59.910
What’s the matter with me?

34:59.910 --> 35:02.480
What did I say?

35:05.150 --> 35:07.220
Is this a prophecy?

35:07.220 --> 35:08.990
I’m not wrong.

35:08.990 --> 35:12.190
It’s understandable for people to say that in a rage.

35:12.190 --> 35:12.890
What do you think?

35:12.890 --> 35:13.890
What did I do?

35:13.890 --> 35:16.930
What kind of curse did you put on me?

35:29.270 --> 35:31.170
I envy you.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.980
You’re still alive.

35:32.980 --> 35:35.350
And you can drink.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.590
Cool?

35:48.590 --> 35:50.730
It must be very cool.

35:51.660 --> 35:55.700
I can barely get water in my bed.

35:55.700 --> 35:59.040
Dumplings and soup must go together.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.280
Are you all right?

36:05.280 --> 36:06.940
Why bother asking him?

36:06.940 --> 36:07.810
He’s alive.

36:07.810 --> 36:10.110
You should ask me.

36:10.110 --> 36:12.550
How does it taste?

36:12.550 --> 36:14.750
I need to ask my mom to replace this vending machine.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.650
That’s its taste.

36:16.650 --> 36:17.890
Drink the blue one beside it.

36:17.890 --> 36:19.720
If you feel sad, just tell me.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.460
Don’t blame the vending machine.

36:24.430 --> 36:28.530
These guys start speaking ill of me right after I turned into a ghost.

36:28.530 --> 36:29.930
Wait.

36:29.930 --> 36:32.200
These guys have been saying that behind my back before.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.770
Me?

36:33.770 --> 36:35.100
Why should I be sad?

36:35.100 --> 36:37.370
It’s not my fault that he ended up being like that.

36:37.370 --> 36:39.540
He was the one who had the accident.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.240
Hey, how can you say that...

36:41.240 --> 36:42.380
I’m just a one-year resident doctor.

36:42.380 --> 36:43.680
I’ve done what I could.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.050
Everyone is born with a destiny.

36:47.050 --> 36:48.950
His current situation

36:48.950 --> 36:52.020
is destined.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.570
Whoops, I thought he would feel better after walking around.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.440
I can’t believe he’s doing it again because of that young man.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.370
The name of this young man

37:08.370 --> 37:10.040
comes across as a professor.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.480
Never thought he also speaks like one.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.540
What do you mean?

37:15.110 --> 37:16.780
I mean, he sounds right,

37:16.780 --> 37:19.280
but his words make others upset.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.920
Understand?

37:22.120 --> 37:24.550
It’s my turn.

37:28.290 --> 37:30.790
It all started that day.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.200
The day this guy first showed up.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.400
Somehow I’ve had a bad feeling since that morning.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.870
Why did I send you to the emergency room?

37:36.870 --> 37:39.100
Who should take the blame?

37:39.100 --> 37:40.640
But now

37:40.640 --> 37:42.110
you put the blame for the accident

37:42.110 --> 37:43.810
on my own destiny.

37:43.810 --> 37:46.510
Oh, good. You come with me.

37:46.510 --> 37:48.710
I will take you to the grave together.

37:48.710 --> 37:50.050
Get over here, Go Seung Tak.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.850
Come over.

37:52.980 --> 37:53.980
What the hell!

37:53.980 --> 37:54.850
What is this?

37:54.850 --> 37:56.790
Darn it!

37:56.790 --> 37:59.520
Come here. Come here.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.830
You get over here.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.330
You get over here.

38:06.930 --> 38:08.830
Hi, we meet again.

38:09.930 --> 38:11.030
Look how scared you are.

38:11.030 --> 38:13.370
It’s not our first meeting.

38:13.370 --> 38:17.540
Well, I find you have a lot of questions...

38:18.070 --> 38:18.840
I’d better go.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.940
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.180
Wait, wait.

38:21.180 --> 38:21.910
What is this?

38:21.910 --> 38:22.810
What’s wrong with me?

38:22.810 --> 38:24.610
What’s wrong with you?

38:24.610 --> 38:26.750
For the comatose ghosts,

38:26.750 --> 38:29.190
there is a goal of action.

38:29.190 --> 38:30.950
In English, it is boundary.

38:30.950 --> 38:32.920
Do you know boundary?

38:32.920 --> 38:34.160
What is that?

38:34.160 --> 38:35.260
Duh!

38:35.260 --> 38:37.260
Look where you are right now.

38:37.260 --> 38:40.700
This is a point.

38:40.700 --> 38:43.930
With this point as the center,

38:43.930 --> 38:46.900
a radius of 100 meters…

38:46.900 --> 38:48.870
That is to say,

38:48.870 --> 38:51.940
the area is...

38:51.940 --> 38:53.140
... so big.

38:54.610 --> 38:59.580
And you can only walk around in this area.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.890
There’s no way you can get out.

39:02.890 --> 39:03.920
What if I get out?

39:03.920 --> 39:04.690
Darn it!

39:04.690 --> 39:07.090
I told you there’s no way out of here.

39:07.090 --> 39:09.030
Maybe you can have a try.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.060
What about me? My boundary?

39:11.060 --> 39:13.800
Where is your body now?

39:13.800 --> 39:16.170
Isn’t it in the ICU?

39:16.170 --> 39:19.300
Now you draw the structure of this hospital

39:19.300 --> 39:21.540
in your head.

39:21.540 --> 39:25.270
You should know it well.

39:30.380 --> 39:31.950
Nonsense!

39:31.950 --> 39:33.850
Who made it?

39:33.850 --> 39:35.280
Bullshit!

39:35.280 --> 39:37.850
I didn’t make it.

39:37.850 --> 39:39.020
It’s God.

39:39.020 --> 39:40.590
What’s more,

39:40.590 --> 39:45.160
never keep away from your body.

39:46.060 --> 39:48.970
If you wake up, then go back at once.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.100
That’s right!

39:51.100 --> 39:53.270
I’m leaving.

39:53.270 --> 39:54.100
What?

39:54.100 --> 39:55.810
Look at me.

40:02.010 --> 40:03.380
This.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.690
My soul is free.

40:13.690 --> 40:15.730
If you envy me, then die.

40:21.530 --> 40:22.630
What?

40:22.630 --> 40:23.900
Seminar?

40:23.900 --> 40:26.000
You mean the case of President Jang?

40:26.000 --> 40:29.910
To make clear the right and wrong, we should figure out the ins and outs.

40:29.910 --> 40:31.770
If it’s called a medical negligence,

40:31.770 --> 40:33.640
the hospital will be in a dilemma.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.680
After all, the patient was not hospitalized.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.950
Ah, yeah.

40:36.950 --> 40:39.220
What’s the matter?

40:39.220 --> 40:40.650
Do you have any worries?

40:40.650 --> 40:44.590
After all, Professor Cha in charge of
the patient is still lying in a hospital bed.

40:46.290 --> 40:47.890
But we can’t just wait around.

40:47.890 --> 40:49.260
Who knows when he will wake up?

40:49.260 --> 40:51.530
Anyway, the seminar can’t wait.

40:51.530 --> 40:54.200
Hold it as fast as possible.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.700
What will happen to Professor Cha?

40:56.700 --> 40:57.900
It’s hard to say.

40:57.900 --> 40:58.970
If he stays like this,

40:58.970 --> 41:00.770
we shall open the trachea later

41:00.770 --> 41:02.210
and put on a gastrostomy tube for him.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.440
He may be sent to a nursing home in about a month.

41:05.440 --> 41:09.410
By the way, when that happens, I don’t know whom to discuss the transfer issue with.

41:09.410 --> 41:11.010
What’s the matter?

41:11.010 --> 41:12.880
He doesn’t have a family.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.020
It seems that he doesn’t have relatives and friends as his guardian, either.

41:16.020 --> 41:19.090
What to do then? It’s so pathetic.

42:32.190 --> 42:35.830
I was supposed to have two surgeries today.

42:35.830 --> 42:38.070
There are three more tomorrow.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.940
All right.

42:40.940 --> 42:44.710
Even if I’m still alive,
the only thing I can do is surgery.

42:44.710 --> 42:47.140
What a boring life!

42:49.480 --> 42:52.280
Since it’s time to go, I should leave gracefully.

42:59.790 --> 43:02.120
Where are you going?

43:02.120 --> 43:05.760
Before you leave, please get me back into the normal state.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.530
President Jang.

43:06.530 --> 43:07.500
Yes?

43:07.500 --> 43:10.000
Does it hurt a little?

43:10.000 --> 43:11.700
Maybe.

43:11.700 --> 43:16.440
I was also a martial artist when young.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.710
Since I happened to meet you here,

43:17.710 --> 43:21.140
- let me show you some moves.
- No, don’t.

43:21.140 --> 43:24.180
What’s wrong with you?

43:25.410 --> 43:27.080
Ah, should we do something?

43:27.080 --> 43:28.950
Let him be. This is better.

43:28.950 --> 43:32.090
I didn’t notice that

43:32.090 --> 43:34.720
he can be such a trouble-maker.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.490
You are a better one.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.830
Darn it!

43:39.830 --> 43:42.130
Oh, my God.

43:42.130 --> 43:45.100
You scared me. When did you come?

43:45.100 --> 43:46.840
Oh, that guy?

43:46.840 --> 43:47.840
He’s a ghost.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.240
Is he a ghost?

43:49.240 --> 43:50.640
He is dead?

43:50.640 --> 43:52.840
No, he is a coma ghost.

43:52.840 --> 43:53.910
Coma?

43:53.910 --> 43:55.780
Are you saying that President Jang is in a coma?

43:55.780 --> 43:56.710
How is that possible?

43:56.710 --> 43:58.210
My surgery is perfect.

43:58.210 --> 44:01.480
Then maybe it has nothing to do with your surgery.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.690
[I Seon Ho]

44:06.190 --> 44:06.960
Hello.

44:06.960 --> 44:07.920
Professor Cha,

44:07.920 --> 44:10.660
the patient is in a strange state.

44:09.330 --> 44:10.590
[I Seon Ho]

44:10.660 --> 44:12.400
Professor Cha, the patient’s pressure is dropping rapidly.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.660
Could it be that his surgical site has cracked?

44:14.660 --> 44:15.830
Where is he now?

44:15.830 --> 44:16.870
Oh, well…

44:16.870 --> 44:18.230
Do you know the VIP ward building?

44:18.230 --> 44:20.400
He’s in the innermost room.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.410
VIP ward.

44:23.940 --> 44:26.240
It’s this way.

44:39.690 --> 44:41.560
Why are you still here?

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
Why did you come here…

44:45.030 --> 44:47.260
[I hope to see you.
Could you come to meet me?
I’ll fly back to America tomorrow morning.
I want to talk with you before leaving.
I’ll wait for you in our old place.]

44:45.700 --> 44:48.000
I hope to see you.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.430
Could you come to meet me?

44:50.430 --> 44:54.600
I’ll fly back to America tomorrow morning.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.670
I want to talk with you before leaving.

44:57.670 --> 45:00.710
I’ll wait for you in our old place.

45:00.710 --> 45:02.380
You asked me to meet with you.

45:02.380 --> 45:04.750
But you didn’t show up.

45:04.750 --> 45:07.080
And then

45:07.080 --> 45:09.790
you came to the operation room.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.150
You…

45:11.150 --> 45:13.590
Why did you act like this?

45:18.490 --> 45:21.060
Hell! Again?

45:26.700 --> 45:27.840
Sorry, miss.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.770
The Vice President has ordered that no one can come in without his permission.

45:33.610 --> 45:35.850
I’ve heard the same excuse nine times.

45:35.850 --> 45:39.010
I want to see him. Have you told him that?

45:39.010 --> 45:42.320
What do you want?

45:45.420 --> 45:47.490
Are you living in the hospital?

45:47.490 --> 45:49.560
Or why are you in and out like a rat?

45:49.560 --> 45:51.590
I just want to check President Jang’s situation.

45:51.590 --> 45:53.060
Will he get better by that?

45:53.060 --> 45:55.900
If you don’t like it…

45:55.900 --> 45:57.530
At least show me the medical records.

45:57.530 --> 46:00.200
Well, so what do you want after you…!

46:00.200 --> 46:01.400
What will you do after that?

46:01.400 --> 46:02.740
This is the same question that I’ve asked you three times.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.240
I heard that President Jang’s operation went well.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.810
There must be a reason for his sudden deterioration.

46:07.810 --> 46:08.980
It could be medicine, infusion,

46:08.980 --> 46:12.250
or during the surgery…

46:12.250 --> 46:15.250
You don’t deserve to be a doctor.

46:15.250 --> 46:16.690
Hey,

46:16.690 --> 46:18.690
stop showing off and get lost.

46:18.690 --> 46:21.920
No matter it’s America or wherever, just get out of my sight.

46:25.430 --> 46:28.130
You seem to be still unclear about it.

46:28.130 --> 46:29.400
Hey,

46:29.400 --> 46:31.230
only when President Jang is alive are you a daughter in this family.

46:31.230 --> 46:33.940
But you are never my sister.

46:33.940 --> 46:35.910
I’ve also said that three times.

46:35.910 --> 46:40.280
You don’t understand my words no matter in the past or now.

46:40.280 --> 46:43.480
It’s the same for me.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.350
What?

46:44.350 --> 46:47.320
I’ve made it clear that you are never my brother.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.320
Three times, I guess.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.590
You are so offensive and rude.

46:51.590 --> 46:54.260
No matter in the past or now, you just…

46:55.760 --> 46:59.130
… never change. I guess you never really grow up.

47:00.230 --> 47:01.060
How dare you…

47:01.060 --> 47:02.260
I’ll come again.

47:02.260 --> 47:04.700
And you’d better either open the door

47:04.700 --> 47:07.240
or show me the records.

47:08.870 --> 47:11.840
President Jang is still alive.

47:15.410 --> 47:18.550
I’m even not sure what crazy things I will do.

47:30.590 --> 47:33.800
I feel so terrible every time I see her. Go to hell!

47:53.080 --> 47:56.420
Are you hurt

47:56.420 --> 47:58.750
just for this little problem?

48:14.470 --> 48:16.540
Just for…

48:16.540 --> 48:19.110
How could you treat me like that for being despised by others?

48:44.200 --> 48:47.900
This is President Jang’s Operation Record.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
[Operation Record]

48:47.900 --> 48:48.940
Dr. Gim.

48:48.940 --> 48:49.770
- Yeah.
- No.

48:49.770 --> 48:53.810
- … the records of Patient No. 363 have been changed as you required.
- Yes.

48:53.810 --> 48:56.380
- His pulse and body temperature have returned to normal…
- Good.

48:56.380 --> 48:58.510
- He is now in a stable state.

48:58.510 --> 49:03.250
We have news from the Neurosurgery Department you mentioned yesterday.

49:03.250 --> 49:04.450
See?

49:04.450 --> 49:06.990
I’ve told you so.

49:06.990 --> 49:11.060
But this is evidence that you are still alive.

49:11.060 --> 49:13.730
You should feel lucky.

49:16.530 --> 49:18.430
Yesterday, intramuscular injection of 1.6…

49:18.430 --> 49:21.640
Dr. Gim Jae Won,

49:21.640 --> 49:23.740
could we have a few words?

49:25.340 --> 49:27.040
About patient Jang Gwang Deok,

49:27.040 --> 49:28.110
what the hell is going on?

49:28.110 --> 49:29.410
Right, what’s going on?

49:29.410 --> 49:30.810
What happened after the surgery?

49:30.810 --> 49:31.910
Well…

49:31.910 --> 49:33.950
The surgical site suddenly cracked.

49:33.950 --> 49:34.520
What?

49:34.520 --> 49:35.120
Why?

49:35.120 --> 49:36.650
Why is that?

49:36.650 --> 49:38.620
He was fine before. How could the surgical site crack so suddenly?

49:38.620 --> 49:41.990
I also felt confusing. So, I took a chance to check his activated partial thromboplastin time.

49:41.990 --> 49:43.730
The results showed that his heparin was too high.

49:43.730 --> 49:44.460
- What?
- What?

49:44.460 --> 49:46.330
Then I injected him with some protamine as the chief ordered.

49:46.330 --> 49:47.830
Luckily, his heartbeat was back to normal.

49:47.830 --> 49:49.130
But his blood pressure keeps dropping now,

49:49.130 --> 49:50.730
which seems to lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain.

49:50.730 --> 49:52.430
Too high heparin? How is that possible?

49:52.430 --> 49:53.440
How much heparin was injected?

49:53.440 --> 49:54.540
I injected 5,000 as directed.

49:54.540 --> 49:55.440
Are you nuts?

49:55.440 --> 49:57.110
5,000?

49:57.110 --> 49:58.040
Hey, An Tae Hyeon,

49:58.040 --> 49:59.140
was that your idea?

49:59.140 --> 49:59.510
Why?

49:59.510 --> 50:00.980
What are you talking about?

50:00.980 --> 50:03.110
I told you to add to 1,000 gradually just in case.

50:03.110 --> 50:04.350
Hey, even 1,000 is too much.

50:04.350 --> 50:05.950
Why? Was anything wrong?

50:05.950 --> 50:07.580
What?

50:07.580 --> 50:09.180
No, you said 5,000.

50:09.180 --> 50:10.190
And you also said it’s bolus.

50:09.450 --> 50:10.690
[Bolus: as a large single dose]

50:10.190 --> 50:11.290
Are you an idiot?

50:11.290 --> 50:12.890
It was not for operation.

50:12.890 --> 50:14.820
How could you give 5,000?

50:14.820 --> 50:17.190
So?

50:17.190 --> 50:19.060
Did you really inject 5,000?

50:19.060 --> 50:20.600
Well,

50:20.600 --> 50:23.430
I didn’t do it myself.

50:28.640 --> 50:31.310
It was an emergency,

50:31.310 --> 50:33.040
so, I asked Go Seung Tak for help.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.240
Go Seung Tak?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.410
Did you ask Go Seung Tak to inject 5,000?

50:37.410 --> 50:39.880
Oh my, is it 5,000 or 1,000?

50:39.880 --> 50:43.290
Anyway, he must have injected a large amount considering the patient’s condition.

50:43.290 --> 50:47.460
I haven’t verified it yet. The chief told me to keep it a secret for the time being.

50:49.090 --> 50:50.130
Go Seung Tak!

50:50.130 --> 50:52.290
Go Seung Tak!

50:52.290 --> 50:55.430
Come here, boy!

50:55.430 --> 50:56.330
You brat!

50:56.330 --> 50:57.800
What the hell did you do to my patient?

50:57.800 --> 51:01.040
Why did you mess with my patient?

51:06.880 --> 51:10.550
Oh, Dr. An Tae Hyeon, you came just in time…

51:10.550 --> 51:13.020
What the hell is this?

51:13.020 --> 51:14.820
Well, you must be here for the heparin. It’s this brat.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.820
It must be this brat…

51:22.390 --> 51:24.390
Where is that brat boy, Dr. An?

51:24.390 --> 51:25.460
Wake up!

51:25.460 --> 51:28.530
How could you talk to a specialist that way?

51:28.530 --> 51:30.430
Who is that brat boy

51:30.430 --> 51:32.600
you just called?

51:37.110 --> 51:39.040
See?

51:39.040 --> 51:41.780
I have told you so.

51:41.780 --> 51:45.350
But this is evidence that you are still alive.

51:46.620 --> 51:48.020
The patient was stabbed in the abdomen

51:48.020 --> 51:49.820
by reinforced concrete

51:49.820 --> 51:52.520
when passing the construction site.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.160
Hey.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.060
Where are you going? We have a patient here.

51:55.060 --> 51:57.790
I am in big trouble. I have no time for him.

51:59.290 --> 52:02.060
Gloves. I need gloves.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.780
No damage to organs and blood vessels.

52:16.780 --> 52:18.210
Just a 10-centimeter-deep wound in the abdomen.

52:18.210 --> 52:19.520
Disinfecting and sewing it up will work.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.750
I’ll leave the rest to you.

52:31.460 --> 52:32.390
Jeo.

52:32.390 --> 52:34.430
Jeo.

52:36.030 --> 52:38.400
Why could I possess Go Seung Tak?

52:38.400 --> 52:42.370
Can you... Can you see me?

52:43.740 --> 52:44.310
It’s me.

52:44.310 --> 52:46.010
Cha Yeong Min.

52:46.010 --> 52:47.710
How to get out of his body?

52:47.710 --> 52:49.780
I just came in inadvertently.

52:49.780 --> 52:50.910
Ah, about that…

52:50.910 --> 52:53.650
How to put it? I see.

52:53.650 --> 52:55.180
You know Iron Man, right?

52:55.180 --> 52:58.350
How did he take off his suit?

52:58.350 --> 53:01.390
He would think, “I want to take off my suit.” Then the suit came off.

53:01.390 --> 53:05.160
So, you need to think about it first.

53:08.030 --> 53:09.830
I’ve thought about it. But it didn’t work.

53:09.830 --> 53:12.830
Then you can try to come out directly.

53:12.830 --> 53:14.400
How to do it directly?

53:14.400 --> 53:16.170
A strong push will do.

53:16.170 --> 53:18.140
P-U-S-H.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.580
What’s happening?

53:24.580 --> 53:26.380
What’s this place?

53:26.380 --> 53:28.520
Why am I here?

53:28.520 --> 53:29.120
Did you see that?

53:29.120 --> 53:30.420
I can possess no one else,

53:30.420 --> 53:31.590
but only him.

53:31.590 --> 53:32.690
Why can I do that to him?

53:32.690 --> 53:34.660
Yeah, how did you do that?

53:34.660 --> 53:35.790
What’s wrong with me?

53:35.790 --> 53:37.890
I don't know if I'm being possessed.

53:39.060 --> 53:39.900
Dispel all evil spirits.

53:39.900 --> 53:41.100
It's not going to dispel.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.730
What? Your destiny?

53:42.730 --> 53:44.600
It's your destiny, brat.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.740
Look at him having a nervous breakdown.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.900
So cool.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.940
So happy.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.140
Look how happy you are.

53:52.140 --> 53:52.940
Yes.

53:52.940 --> 53:53.310
I am so happy.

53:53.310 --> 53:55.810
You don't even know you're going to die.

53:55.810 --> 53:56.410
What?

53:56.410 --> 53:58.710
Don’t be in and out frequently just because you can possess.

53:58.710 --> 54:02.380
You may never wake up if you go on like this.

54:11.690 --> 54:13.330
One times nine is nine.

54:13.330 --> 54:15.560
Two times nine is eighteen.

54:15.560 --> 54:17.800
Three times nine is twenty-seven.

54:23.170 --> 54:24.710
Mom.

54:24.710 --> 54:27.310
I have a quick question for you.

54:28.610 --> 54:30.910
If…

54:30.910 --> 54:33.920
Well, aren't my voice and looks pretty good?

54:34.850 --> 54:35.650
Yeah.

54:35.650 --> 54:37.920
I think I'm handsome.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.520
So maybe I should stop being a doctor.

54:39.520 --> 54:42.160
If I become a singer or an actor.

54:44.060 --> 54:46.300
I'm gonna get kicked out of my family?

54:46.300 --> 54:47.530
Son.

54:47.530 --> 54:49.800
I'll see you at home later.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
OK?

54:57.310 --> 55:00.080
Dr. Yun, please come and have a look.

55:02.510 --> 55:04.480
Doctor, please come here.

55:18.460 --> 55:20.300
What are you doing here?

55:22.800 --> 55:25.630
I was just going to... go in.

55:25.630 --> 55:26.540
What’s wrong?

55:26.540 --> 55:28.970
Do you want to see if the stabbing victim is still here?

55:28.970 --> 55:32.210
Is the stabbing victim still here?

55:32.210 --> 55:33.810
After his wound was stitched up, he left.

55:33.810 --> 55:38.010
I did what you told me to do, Dr. Go.

55:38.010 --> 55:39.920
Well.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.820
Looks like I had a gift and made another diagnosis.

55:42.820 --> 55:44.690
Right?

55:44.690 --> 55:46.920
Is there anything strange?

55:46.920 --> 55:47.860
What?

55:47.860 --> 55:48.590
Me?

55:48.590 --> 55:50.290
Strange?

55:50.290 --> 55:52.330
Like a headache.

55:52.330 --> 55:54.300
Or your limbs are out of control.

55:54.300 --> 55:55.230
I'm fine.

55:55.230 --> 55:58.030
Everything is fine from my head to toe.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.070
That’s ok.

56:01.070 --> 56:03.310
Since you're fine,
why don't you go get a cup of coffee?

56:03.340 --> 56:06.840
Okay, I'll get you some super expensive coffee.

56:13.420 --> 56:16.180
Are you trying to hide it?

56:16.180 --> 56:18.250
Then I

56:18.250 --> 56:20.320
will help you.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.330
It’s your coffee.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.330
Ah, I got you.

56:26.330 --> 56:27.230
Hey.

56:27.230 --> 56:28.430
Why aren't you answering my calls?

56:28.430 --> 56:31.900
Do you know what coffee it is?

56:33.340 --> 56:35.170
I have to ask you something.

56:35.170 --> 56:36.840
How long do I have to stay in the emergency room?

56:36.840 --> 56:38.870
Hey, that's not important right now.

56:38.870 --> 56:42.080
Do you think there's anything more important to me right now?

56:42.080 --> 56:43.780
Brother?

56:43.780 --> 56:45.010
He’s coming.

56:45.010 --> 56:48.350
He’s coming here.

56:48.350 --> 56:49.520
What?

56:49.520 --> 56:50.220
Who?

56:50.220 --> 56:51.120
You know that.

56:51.120 --> 56:54.690
President Jang’s son.

56:54.690 --> 56:58.130
President Jang’s son?

57:13.940 --> 57:18.380
What's Plan B?

57:20.850 --> 57:23.150
Wasn't the operation a success?

57:23.150 --> 57:24.750
I knew this would happen.

57:24.750 --> 57:28.860
Because Professor Cha was in an accident and I didn't tell you.

57:28.860 --> 57:32.960
President Jang failed to wake up.

57:32.960 --> 57:34.530
What?

57:34.530 --> 57:38.000
Unconscious just like Professor Cha.

57:39.100 --> 57:42.600
Why did Professor Cha have an accident so suddenly?

57:42.600 --> 57:43.570
What the hell is going on here?

57:43.570 --> 57:47.010
The patient and the surgeon fell into a coma the same day.

57:49.950 --> 57:52.250
There you are.

57:52.250 --> 57:58.250
Did you find a way to save me?

58:02.290 --> 58:04.160
I was really wronged.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.360
I wouldn't have made you like this.

58:06.360 --> 58:10.430
Who would it be if it wasn't you?

58:10.430 --> 58:15.840
You don't seem to be the kind of person to pass the buck to a subordinate.

58:15.840 --> 58:19.040
That's a good thing about being a leader.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.280
You will be responsible to me

58:20.280 --> 58:22.310
with this attitude.

58:22.310 --> 58:25.150
What... What can I do?

58:25.150 --> 58:26.780
Can't you see me like this?

58:26.780 --> 58:29.380
I am a ghost like you.

58:29.380 --> 58:29.990
Ghost.

58:29.990 --> 58:33.260
Ghost.

58:33.290 --> 58:38.730
Really... I can't say you deserve it.

58:38.760 --> 58:42.400
As a doctor, you leave the patient alone.

58:42.400 --> 58:45.070
What's the emergency?

58:45.070 --> 58:48.070
You can undo your wrongs yourself.

58:48.070 --> 58:52.440
You're gonna save me anyway.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.840
If you don't want to be killed by my son.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.480
President.

58:57.480 --> 59:00.550
Control the reporters first. Don't let the news get out.

59:00.550 --> 59:03.950
An official announcement is expected soon. Let them wait.

59:03.950 --> 59:07.520
Do I even have to tell you everything?

59:09.890 --> 59:13.160
Damn it.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.870
My father's gonna be on the grapevine these days.

59:18.400 --> 59:23.000
So why do you listen to me?

59:23.000 --> 59:27.880
I wish you'd listened to your wonderful smart little girl.

59:27.880 --> 59:31.110
You should live another year without surgery.

59:31.110 --> 59:33.620
I wish you had listened to me earlier.

59:33.620 --> 59:35.950
Then I don't have to do this.

59:35.950 --> 59:38.920
Why did you get blood on my hands?

59:38.920 --> 59:43.560
Well, no time to rest.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.330
This is Jang Min Ho.

59:45.330 --> 59:46.530
Yes.

59:46.530 --> 59:49.630
Now?

1:00:18.930 --> 1:00:21.160
I'm surprised Professor Cha got caught up in this.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:23.700
That's a lot of damage to the hospital.

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:28.940
I thought you had made it.

1:00:28.940 --> 1:00:31.140
I'm not some kind of psychopath.

1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:32.610
Professor Cha is the property of this hospital.

1:00:32.610 --> 1:00:35.780
Why would I do this to a man who could make me money?

1:00:35.780 --> 1:00:39.580
You can have a second thought.

1:00:39.580 --> 1:00:41.680
Let me know when it's over.

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:44.620
It’s my area of expertise.

1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:48.160
What do you mean there's a meeting?

1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:50.090
Is there any guarantee?

1:00:50.090 --> 1:00:53.860
You think I started before I did it in thoracic surgery?

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:57.030
You don't have to worry about that.

1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:02.370
The problem is Professor Cha.

1:01:02.370 --> 1:01:04.370
What?

1:01:04.370 --> 1:01:06.980
But it's going to work out.

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:10.150
Let's think about it.

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:22.160
Well, brother Jae Won.

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.760
I'm in a hurry now and I'd like to ask you a favor.

1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:29.730
Please give President Jang an injection.

1:01:29.730 --> 1:01:34.940
Back then, I told you it’s heparin 1000.

1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:37.670
Professor Cha said it’s heparin 5000.

1:01:37.670 --> 1:01:40.410
You're gonna help me.

1:01:44.810 --> 1:01:45.850
What?

1:01:45.850 --> 1:01:47.720
It’s getting cold.

1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:50.820
Do you worship with coffee?

1:01:50.820 --> 1:01:53.620
Yes, coffee.

1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:55.490
Got another big slap on the back.

1:01:55.490 --> 1:01:56.260
What?

1:01:56.260 --> 1:01:57.130
The bed in the duty room.

1:01:57.130 --> 1:02:01.830
I can't sleep on it.

1:02:01.830 --> 1:02:02.930
Ah. My waist.

1:02:02.930 --> 1:02:05.930
You were on duty once. Why are you so delicate?

1:02:05.930 --> 1:02:08.800
So, I'm gonna show off like a man.

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:10.970
Help me change all the beds in the duty room.

1:02:10.970 --> 1:02:12.410
Why do hospitals make so much money?

1:02:12.410 --> 1:02:16.510
Oh, by the way, Professor Cha's lead surgeon

1:02:16.510 --> 1:02:20.220
will be Dr. An Tae Hyeon.

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:21.950
To keep your doctor experience from being flawed,

1:02:21.950 --> 1:02:25.290
as a brother, I took care of it for you.

1:02:25.290 --> 1:02:27.560
Anyway, thank you for your efforts.

1:02:28.590 --> 1:02:29.460
I was worried about you.

1:02:29.460 --> 1:02:31.730
I didn't know you were so good.

1:02:31.730 --> 1:02:33.960
Keep it up in the future.

1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:38.200
Don't forget, I'm always behind you.

1:03:35.290 --> 1:03:38.490
There's another benefit

1:03:38.490 --> 1:03:41.600
to being a ghost.

1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:53.410
[EunSang University Medical Center]

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:46.570
I can hear a lot of things.

1:03:47.870 --> 1:03:51.340
I can know a lot of things.

1:03:55.740 --> 1:04:02.850
But there's one thing I don't know.

1:04:05.450 --> 1:04:09.260
It was in the operating room the day you picked up the scalpel.

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:13.830
Were you trying to kill me instead of saving me?

1:04:15.330 --> 1:04:18.800
You came to ICU

1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:26.070
and said you wanted me to wake up.

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.610
Was that a lie?

1:04:31.610 --> 1:04:35.150
Did you feel guilty afterwards?

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:44.690
I didn't even know that...

1:04:46.260 --> 1:04:50.030
So,

1:04:50.030 --> 1:04:53.100
colleagues arrived late at the operating room.

1:04:53.100 --> 1:04:55.740
Was it late because they were dealing with President Jang's problem?

1:04:55.740 --> 1:04:59.670
Heparin wasn't a mistake. It was intentional?

1:04:59.670 --> 1:05:02.780
Since when.

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:06.680
When did it start?

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:10.150
How could you do that to human life?

1:05:10.150 --> 1:05:11.920
You're an asshole.

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:15.660
Why? Why?

1:05:18.130 --> 1:05:21.230
Because you want to get certified as a specialist?

1:05:21.230 --> 1:05:24.130
You do what he says,

1:05:24.130 --> 1:05:27.800
and your brother will let you have it?

1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:30.940
You're a jerk.

1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:34.240
Do you have any idea what you've done?

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:44.190
Hello?

1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:48.290
ICU?

1:05:48.290 --> 1:05:49.790
What's wrong with Professor Cha?

1:05:49.790 --> 1:05:51.560
What's wrong with me?

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:53.860
I'll be right there.

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:26.220
-=Preview of the next episode=-

1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:27.420
You can wake up.

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:28.490
Cha Yeong Min, come on.

1:07:28.490 --> 1:07:30.590
Did I say something like that?

1:07:30.590 --> 1:07:31.930
Yeah, you said it yourself.

1:07:31.930 --> 1:07:34.430
I have repaid you.

1:07:34.430 --> 1:07:35.200
Why would you do that?

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:36.260
How to be responsible?

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.000
I'll blow the whistle.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.270
What are you talking about when you can't protect yourself?

1:07:41.270 --> 1:07:41.970
What happened to her hands?

1:07:41.970 --> 1:07:44.170
Now let's organize our route.

1:07:44.170 --> 1:07:45.740
Why is she watching this?

1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:47.140
What are you up to?

1:07:47.140 --> 1:07:49.010
You need to be strong outside.

1:07:49.010 --> 1:07:53.280
I'm sending you somewhere else today.
