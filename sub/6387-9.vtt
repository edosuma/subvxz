00:17.267 --> 00:18.267
No.

00:18.302 --> 00:19.669
- But--
- Absolutely not, Charlie.

00:19.704 --> 00:21.805
- Yeah, I get it--
- No means no, you know?

00:21.840 --> 00:25.109
I'm just asking you to put in
a semi-decent word for me.

00:25.144 --> 00:26.778
There'll be no putting of any kind.

00:26.812 --> 00:30.047
And I am kindly asking you
not to take this meeting.

00:30.082 --> 00:31.449
But it's on the books.

00:31.483 --> 00:33.818
- Well, then cancel that shit.
- That's absurd!

00:33.852 --> 00:35.553
Why? You have no problem
canceling on me

00:35.587 --> 00:37.688
when you got to go get one
of your fucking boils lanced.

00:37.723 --> 00:38.956
That was twice.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.257
And it's different.

00:40.292 --> 00:42.793
I'm not worried
about impressing you anymore.

00:42.827 --> 00:44.795
Exactly. That's what
happens in a relationship.

00:44.829 --> 00:46.063
You stop caring.

00:46.097 --> 00:47.865
Next thing you know,
the sex is sporadic,

00:47.899 --> 00:50.568
the blow jobs biannual, and
assplay is out of the question.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.403
Hey, when it comes to me and you Hank,

00:52.437 --> 00:54.137
assplay is never out of the question.

00:54.172 --> 00:55.439
Oh, eat a dick, Charlie--

00:55.473 --> 00:57.574
preferably Stu's,
with mustard and ketchup on it,

00:57.608 --> 00:58.908
maybe some with Marcy, too.

00:58.943 --> 01:00.209
This kid is blowing up!

01:00.244 --> 01:01.978
Eddie Nero wants to star in his movie.

01:02.012 --> 01:03.479
In about five minutes,

01:03.514 --> 01:05.916
Tyler's going to be the hottest
screenwriter in the business.

01:05.950 --> 01:07.718
Someone has to represent him.
Why not me?

01:07.752 --> 01:11.055
Because you're
my fucking agent, Charlie.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.657
I could lose my job.

01:12.691 --> 01:14.660
You already masturbated
yourself out of a job.

01:14.694 --> 01:16.061
And guess what.
You bounced back.

01:16.096 --> 01:17.463
You landed on your webbed feet.

01:17.497 --> 01:18.664
If you can make it through that shit,

01:18.698 --> 01:19.831
you can make it through anything.

01:19.866 --> 01:21.467
This is fucking bullshit!

01:21.502 --> 01:23.970
No. I will tell you what's
fucking bullshit, Charlie,

01:24.004 --> 01:26.606
is why I have to explain
to my agent and friend

01:26.641 --> 01:29.310
of way too many years
why it's absurdly inappropriate

01:29.344 --> 01:31.178
to represent my daughter's
boyfriend as a client.

01:31.213 --> 01:34.482
No, I-I get
what you're saying.

01:34.516 --> 01:36.418
But...

01:36.452 --> 01:37.986
Why is it inappropriate exactly?

01:38.020 --> 01:39.821
Because it offends me...

01:39.855 --> 01:41.389
on a deeply personal level.

01:41.424 --> 01:43.492
Can you grasp that Sammy Glick?

01:46.296 --> 01:47.563
I guess so.

01:47.598 --> 01:49.599
Good. Now give me
a hug and a kiss.

01:49.633 --> 01:51.501
It's my first day of work,
and I'm running late.

01:51.535 --> 01:53.903
Oh, shit. That's right.
I forgot.

01:53.937 --> 01:56.272
Wait.
You forgot?

01:56.307 --> 01:58.208
You're my agent.
You're the Samurai's agent.

01:58.242 --> 01:59.976
You're Stu's agent, and yet you forgot

02:00.011 --> 02:02.378
that today is the first day
of shooting of <i>Santa Monica Cop.</i>

02:02.413 --> 02:04.581
This is why people
don't like you, Charlie.

02:04.615 --> 02:06.382
Who doesn't like me?

02:06.416 --> 02:07.583
People.

02:12.556 --> 02:13.956
People love me.

02:16.993 --> 02:27.146

03:13.430 --> 03:16.287
You're gonna need a bigger gun.

03:17.103 --> 03:19.356
Nah, man.
That shit ain't working, man.

03:19.485 --> 03:21.686
Cut.
It's not working.

03:21.721 --> 03:23.910
It's not working.

03:24.030 --> 03:27.244
- Hank, it's not working.
- Take that, watermelon!

03:28.908 --> 03:30.380
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.388
It turns out I am quite
the fruit ninja.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.512
It's fucking shitty.
The line's not working, Moody.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.099
I told you it was stupid.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.435
You can't just rip off one the
classic movie lines of all time.

03:39.813 --> 03:41.714
But it sounded
badass at the time, huh?

03:41.748 --> 03:44.450
Yeah, because we were really
high and watching <i>Jaws.</i>

03:44.484 --> 03:45.918
I ain't feeling that shit
no more, though.

03:45.952 --> 03:47.386
Give him something else, Hank.

03:47.421 --> 03:51.259
Sure, let me reach into my
grab bag of classic movie lines.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.866
Oh, nothing there.
Hold on.

03:52.986 --> 03:54.344
Let me check up my ass.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.830
What the fuck we paying him for?

03:58.865 --> 04:00.698
His snappy fucking dialogue.

04:00.733 --> 04:02.416
Sorkin passed, but he's a fan.

04:02.536 --> 04:04.020
Really?
That's awesome.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.504
It ain't just the fucking line, man.

04:05.538 --> 04:06.517
It's the whole fucking scene, man.

04:06.763 --> 04:08.096
That shit is weak.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.764
I don't even know what I want anymore.

04:09.799 --> 04:11.100
Well, you want the girl.

04:11.134 --> 04:13.502
Who wouldn't want that girl?

04:13.536 --> 04:15.304
What's up, babe?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.305
I would just kill
the motherfucker, wouldn't I?

04:17.339 --> 04:18.741
Well, he's your partner, Sam.

04:18.774 --> 04:20.175
Yeah, but he fucked my girl.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.077
But you like him.
And he makes you laugh.

04:22.112 --> 04:23.579
Let me tell you something, man.

04:23.613 --> 04:25.514
- Oh, whoa, whoa!
- Whoever fucked my girl--

04:25.548 --> 04:27.015
brother's going to be sucking on this.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.919
You know, I think
this is brilliant, Sam.

04:29.953 --> 04:31.787
But the studio--
they're not going to want you

04:31.822 --> 04:33.122
killing your best friend and partner.

04:33.156 --> 04:34.824
They feel that that's the kind of thing

04:34.858 --> 04:37.761
that makes you
really fucking unlikable.

04:37.795 --> 04:39.396
I told you, Stu, right?

04:39.430 --> 04:41.097
Don't use that fucking
word around me, man.

04:41.132 --> 04:42.966
"Unlikable"?
I hate that shit.

04:45.069 --> 04:48.037
Actually makes the user
unlikable. Bong-bong.

04:48.071 --> 04:50.306
With all due respect, Hank,
shut the fuck up.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.540
You know what?

04:51.574 --> 04:53.242
Y'all motherfuckers
figure this shit out.

04:53.276 --> 04:55.044
Me and my boys are gonna go
smoke some fucking weed,

04:55.078 --> 04:56.645
- get my head straight, a'ight?
- A'ight.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.381
I'll be in the fucking room, man.

04:58.415 --> 05:00.783
- So you know what to do?
- Uh, no.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.651
Just rewrite the fucking scene,

05:02.686 --> 05:04.153
move some shit around,

05:04.187 --> 05:06.755
- write a better kill zinger.
- And if I can't?

05:06.790 --> 05:08.991
Well, I could throw a rock

05:09.025 --> 05:11.327
and find another writer
willing to replace you

05:11.361 --> 05:14.930
for half the money
the studio's paying you, Hank.

05:14.965 --> 05:16.731
I'll see what I can do.

05:21.971 --> 05:23.806
What's wrong, Charlie?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.941
Nothing.
Not a thing.

05:25.975 --> 05:28.643
I'm getting my dick sucked
on a beautiful day

05:28.678 --> 05:31.714
by an even more beautiful girl--
What could possibly be wrong?

05:31.748 --> 05:35.250
Well, there's something very
wrong with your penis right now.

05:35.285 --> 05:37.086
There are a great many things wrong

05:37.120 --> 05:39.055
with my penis, dear Lizzie.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.925
No, you're just not responding
the way you normally do.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.860
I think I'm pretty hard.

05:44.894 --> 05:47.529
Usually, you're forged of iron.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.799
I guess I'm a little perturbed

05:49.833 --> 05:53.002
by this whole Hank and Tyler thing.

05:53.037 --> 05:56.039
What is a sleazeball agent to do?

05:56.073 --> 05:58.441
Well, I told you what I think.

05:58.475 --> 05:59.775
I know.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.944
Some things
are just business, Charlie,

06:01.979 --> 06:04.547
- and should be handled as such.
- I know.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.283
But I've never seen him
so adamant about something.

06:07.317 --> 06:08.885
He's my best friend.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.653
Well, do you think
you could service them both

06:10.687 --> 06:12.988
- without conflict?
- Absolutely...

06:13.023 --> 06:14.624
I think.

06:14.658 --> 06:17.026
Personally, I don't think it's
fair to ask a thing like that.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.394
It's very self-serving.

06:18.429 --> 06:19.762
I agree.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.530
Mmhmm.

06:21.565 --> 06:24.100
I think you're just going
to have to go with your gut

06:24.135 --> 06:25.769
on this one, Charlie.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.537
- Go with gut.
- Mm-hmm.

06:27.571 --> 06:29.039
Got it.

06:35.246 --> 06:36.747
Oh, um...

06:36.781 --> 06:39.450
Have you had a chance
to talk to Stuart...

06:39.484 --> 06:40.751
about <i>Santa Monica Cop--</i>

06:40.785 --> 06:42.686
if there's a part
that I could read for?

06:42.721 --> 06:44.388
You know, something small, of course.

06:44.422 --> 06:46.123
No, but I will.

06:46.158 --> 06:47.692
You promise?

06:47.726 --> 06:50.595
I promise.

07:08.647 --> 07:10.047
Hold on.

07:14.886 --> 07:17.487
Fuck it. Come on in.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.622
How's it coming, Hank?

07:19.657 --> 07:21.658
Just one of those days, Stu.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.162
- Shit's not flowing.
- Copy that.

07:25.196 --> 07:28.499
You've got to let the cash
be your laxative, Hank.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.435
Hey, that's a pretty good line, Stu.

07:30.469 --> 07:33.505
I'm sorry I can't use it
in your big, shitty movie.

07:33.539 --> 07:36.542
Well, you got 15 minutes, Hank.

07:36.576 --> 07:39.912
My big, shitty movie
is losing the light.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.150
Come in.

07:44.185 --> 07:46.019
Can you do me a huge favor?

07:46.053 --> 07:49.523
- What's that?
- Save my career.

07:49.557 --> 07:51.192
I'm sorry.
You must have me confused.

07:51.226 --> 07:54.429
- I-I'm just the writer.
- And I'm just the girl.

07:54.463 --> 07:55.897
Well, at least you're <i>the</i> girl.

07:55.931 --> 07:57.632
You're not just <i>a</i> girl.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.134
I'm window dressing.

07:59.169 --> 08:00.369
I'm here to smile,

08:00.403 --> 08:02.404
give teenage boys
something to jerk off to,

08:02.438 --> 08:04.573
and get sexually harassed
by the director.

08:04.607 --> 08:07.343
He is kind of a smarmy
little douche, isn't he?

08:07.377 --> 08:10.045
My character needs to grow some balls.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.248
She's basically just
a dial tone with tits.

08:12.282 --> 08:13.682
I'll get right on that.

08:13.717 --> 08:15.084
- I'll show them to you.
- Your tits?

08:15.118 --> 08:17.486
- I don't want to see your tits.
- Really?

08:17.521 --> 08:19.188
Well, that's not completely true,

08:19.223 --> 08:20.890
but you don't have to show them to me.

08:20.925 --> 08:22.859
I mean, I may be a schmuck
with an underwood

08:22.893 --> 08:24.861
but I'm not a fucking sleaze merchant.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.963
Look, I know my boobs got me this job,

08:29.033 --> 08:31.902
I went to Juilliard.
I'm a fucking theater geek.

08:31.936 --> 08:35.306
I love words.
Dialogue is like music to me.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.842
Whatever you write,
I will make it sing.

08:38.876 --> 08:41.212
Help me, Hank.

08:41.246 --> 08:42.746
You're my only hope.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.016
All right, you're cool, you're smart,

08:45.051 --> 08:47.219
and you're appealing
to my subversive nobility.

08:47.254 --> 08:50.957
Plus, it doesn't hurt that I'm
really fucking high right now.

08:50.991 --> 08:53.193
Let's see if we can't sneak
a smart, cool chick

08:53.227 --> 08:55.195
into this piece of shit.

08:55.230 --> 08:58.765
Oh! That feels rad.
Keep doing that.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.468
You know, I'm getting inspired.

09:00.502 --> 09:03.771
I feel some ballsy banter coming on.

09:03.806 --> 09:05.440
Oh.

09:05.474 --> 09:07.776
If you keep pressing those
savage yabbos into my back,

09:07.810 --> 09:09.377
I'm not going to get anything done.

09:09.411 --> 09:11.846
Just saying.

09:11.881 --> 09:14.782
Well, maybe one more time.
Then we'll get started.

09:20.122 --> 09:21.756
Why'd you cancel on me, Charlie?

09:21.790 --> 09:25.127
Well, I--you know, I've
thought about this a lot, Tyler,

09:25.161 --> 09:28.496
and I just don't feel
it would be appropriate

09:28.531 --> 09:31.700
to represent you
while I'm representing Hank.

09:31.734 --> 09:35.469
And seeing as how I'm damned to
represent Hank unto eternity--

09:35.504 --> 09:36.637
Wait, wait, wait.

09:36.672 --> 09:38.573
You don't think it's appropriate,

09:38.607 --> 09:41.242
or Hank doesn't think
it's appropriate?

09:41.277 --> 09:43.811
Does it matter?

09:43.846 --> 09:45.012
Not to me.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.347
I've got a bunch of meetings lined up.

09:47.382 --> 09:50.184
But it was really cool
to meet you, though, Charlie--

09:50.218 --> 09:52.019
kind of a dream come true.

09:52.053 --> 09:53.587
Why is that?

09:53.621 --> 09:55.322
Well, 'cause
you're Hank Moody's agent.

09:55.356 --> 09:56.757
Who wouldn't want to be represented

09:56.791 --> 09:57.758
by Hank Moody's agent?

09:57.792 --> 09:58.926
From where I'm sitting,

09:58.960 --> 10:00.427
that'd be
the coolest fucking thing ever.

10:00.462 --> 10:03.264
Who else are you meeting with?

10:03.298 --> 10:04.732
All the majors.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.101
There's is guy at C.A.A.

10:06.135 --> 10:08.370
He's got this little black
book full of whores.

10:08.404 --> 10:09.938
He offered to hook me up gratis.

10:09.973 --> 10:11.407
Can you match that?

10:11.441 --> 10:14.377
I'd love to, Tyler, but they
watch me like a hawk here.

10:14.411 --> 10:17.179
I so much as look at
a naked picture on the Internet,

10:17.214 --> 10:19.950
and H.R. swoops in,
and an alarm goes off.

10:19.984 --> 10:22.319
It's fucking terrifying.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.789
Totally.

10:25.823 --> 10:28.225
Well, if this isn't going further,

10:28.259 --> 10:29.726
then I might as well take off.

10:29.761 --> 10:34.298
Wh do you say you and me
get the hell out of here,

10:34.332 --> 10:35.666
we go get a drink someplace?

10:35.700 --> 10:38.168
I could give you some advice

10:38.203 --> 10:41.305
about what to watch out for out there.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.474
Sure, I could drink.

10:46.111 --> 10:47.712
This is really good, Hank.

10:47.746 --> 10:49.313
Thank you.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.716
I feel like I'm in this movie
all of a sudden.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.751
My pleasure.
I hope it helps.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.654
Good luck with all the dress-up
and the make-believe.

10:56.688 --> 10:59.323
Seeing how good this is makes
me think of all the other scenes

10:59.358 --> 11:01.592
- we could dig into together.
- Whoa, slow down there.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.761
I'm here mainly to burnish
the Samurai's banter.

11:03.795 --> 11:05.029
Can I show you my tits?

11:05.063 --> 11:07.565
I told you, you don't have to...

11:07.599 --> 11:08.899
necessarily.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.534
I'm doing
my first nude scene this week,

11:10.569 --> 11:12.536
and I'm a little insecure
about the girls.

11:12.571 --> 11:15.573
I'm sure the girls are ♪ fine ♪.

11:15.607 --> 11:17.841
Doesn't even begin to cover it.

11:17.876 --> 11:20.277
You are going to enchant
an entire generation

11:20.312 --> 11:22.579
of teenage boys
with those pound puppies.

11:22.614 --> 11:25.549
That's, like,
the perfect reaction--thank you.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.519
And nab yourself
a Mr. Skinward in the bargain.

11:28.553 --> 11:31.388
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.290
No, I mean...

11:33.325 --> 11:35.193
Thank you, Hank...

11:35.227 --> 11:39.464
- for everything.
- You're very welcome.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.800
- Mmm. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.202
Gosh, we have some excellent manners.

11:45.237 --> 11:48.105
This is like some serious
merchant ivory shit here.

11:48.139 --> 11:49.907
I guess I'm just a firm believer

11:49.941 --> 11:51.142
in repaying favors.

11:51.176 --> 11:52.910
Oh.

11:52.944 --> 11:55.013
Hey, did you hear the one
about the Polish actress

11:55.047 --> 11:57.915
that came to Hollywood
and blew the writer?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.951
Just kidding.
Keep going.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.821
Okay, where are the fucking pages?

12:03.855 --> 12:07.424
- Holy fucking shit!
- Oh, my word.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.692
Who the fuck do you
think you are, Moody?

12:09.727 --> 12:11.761
Don't shoot me.
I'm only the piano player.

12:11.795 --> 12:14.997
I cast her, you fucking prick.

12:15.031 --> 12:16.965
I've had my eye on her
this whole time!

12:16.999 --> 12:18.399
Her ass is mine!

12:18.433 --> 12:19.834
How's that working out for you?

12:19.868 --> 12:20.934
I want him fired.

12:20.969 --> 12:22.336
You're going to have to run that

12:22.370 --> 12:24.071
- past the Samurai.
- I can't do that.

12:24.105 --> 12:26.073
That guy scares the shit out of me.

12:26.107 --> 12:27.474
Hey, how about defending me, Stu?

12:27.509 --> 12:29.143
I wasn't the one who got caught

12:29.177 --> 12:30.778
with his prick
in a young lady's mouth.

12:30.812 --> 12:33.113
Oh, well, excuse me
for accepting a blow job

12:33.148 --> 12:35.649
in exchange
for an honest 15 minutes' work.

12:35.684 --> 12:37.618
That woman is a legitimate actress.

12:37.652 --> 12:39.119
She can blow whoever she wants.

12:39.154 --> 12:40.955
My movie is going to shit.

12:40.989 --> 12:43.190
Are you crying?

12:43.225 --> 12:44.592
No, I'm just--

12:44.626 --> 12:47.494
There is no crying
in tent-pole filmmaking!

12:47.529 --> 12:49.863
You fucking Mary.
Go get some fucking pamprin.

12:49.897 --> 12:51.264
Go on! Go on!

12:51.299 --> 12:52.899
Go on! Go on!

12:52.934 --> 12:54.802
Get your shit together, man!

12:56.438 --> 12:58.372
These pages are really good, Hank.

12:58.407 --> 13:00.107
Totally deserved the B.J.

13:00.142 --> 13:01.809
I know, right?

13:11.418 --> 13:13.919
So do you have any idea
what you want to do next?

13:13.953 --> 13:15.620
Oh, yeah, I've got a bunch of ideas.

13:15.654 --> 13:18.323
I actually, um, pitched some
over to the W.B. guys,

13:18.357 --> 13:20.091
and they pretty much shit their pants.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.492
Yeah, that's a problem over there.

13:21.527 --> 13:23.127
They said that they
could put me in a room

13:23.162 --> 13:26.631
with studio heads, and I could
sell my ideas immediately.

13:26.665 --> 13:29.267
Really?
That's--that's great, Tyler.

13:29.302 --> 13:30.468
I think I'll be fine.

13:30.502 --> 13:33.071
Yeah, you--
you're going to do great.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.774
It was really cool of Hank
to give me a leg up like this.

13:35.808 --> 13:37.842
You know,
I'm actually kind of surprised

13:37.877 --> 13:39.377
he's so against you representing me.

13:39.412 --> 13:41.379
It's a conflict.

13:41.413 --> 13:43.882
You'd be going up
on a lot of the same jobs.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.917
No, I get it.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.485
Man, it'd be cool if we could do

13:47.519 --> 13:49.220
something together, though, you know?

13:49.254 --> 13:51.022
That would be cool.

13:51.056 --> 13:53.457
That would be a big deal.

13:53.492 --> 13:56.327
- I got this one idea where--
- You know what?

13:56.361 --> 13:58.729
Let's do this!

14:00.598 --> 14:02.032
What?

14:02.066 --> 14:04.068
I want to do this.
I want to work with you.

14:04.102 --> 14:05.903
You don't worry.
I will smooth it over with Hank.

14:05.937 --> 14:08.139
- What, you want to sign me now?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

14:08.173 --> 14:10.942
I'm going with my gut on this one.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.176
I don't know.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.745
What do you mean you don't know?

14:13.779 --> 14:15.646
What happened to the "Working
with Hank Moody's agent,

14:15.681 --> 14:17.181
that would be,
like, the coolest thing"?

14:17.215 --> 14:19.183
Well, I don't know--I mean,
I've got all these agents

14:19.217 --> 14:21.385
who are genuinely excited
about being in business with me.

14:21.419 --> 14:23.720
I wouldn't want to be, you know,
twisting your arm or anything.

14:23.755 --> 14:25.889
You're not twisting my arm,
not at all.

14:25.924 --> 14:29.725
Kid, I want to work with you.
Let's do this!

14:29.760 --> 14:31.427
Something feels weird.

14:31.461 --> 14:32.828
You want me to set you up
with a whore?

14:32.863 --> 14:34.196
I can do that--
done!

14:34.230 --> 14:37.132
No, I don't want you
to set me up with a whore.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.900
I have a girlfriend.

14:38.935 --> 14:41.135
- Becca?
- Becca.

14:41.170 --> 14:43.438
The daughter of your
best friend and star client.

14:43.472 --> 14:45.707
Right. Great girl.

14:45.742 --> 14:48.043
You're weird, dude.

14:48.077 --> 14:49.912
Yes. Yes, I am.

14:49.946 --> 14:53.383
I'm also a fucking shark,
and I will slay dragons for you.

14:55.987 --> 14:57.354
Well...

14:57.388 --> 15:00.157
Those are all very generically
passionate words.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.059
But...

15:02.093 --> 15:04.295
I think I need to see some
of this passion in action.

15:04.329 --> 15:08.131
Anything.
You name it, I will do it.

15:10.935 --> 15:13.771
Do you see that guy in there?

15:19.111 --> 15:21.612
Sure.
How could I miss him?

15:21.646 --> 15:22.779
Go up to him

15:22.814 --> 15:25.516
and tell him...

15:25.550 --> 15:28.852
that you want to suck his dick...

15:28.886 --> 15:30.020
What?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.155
And finger his asshole.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.230
You're kidding me, right?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.369
Y-you're kidding.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.842
No?

15:53.578 --> 15:55.111
I've got that meeting
at I.C.M.

15:55.146 --> 15:57.047
I should probably get going.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.883
♪ My bag and my bottle
and my medicine, too ♪

15:59.917 --> 16:03.721
♪ don't know where I'm headed,
where I'm going to ♪

16:03.755 --> 16:06.090
♪ run away from you, oh ♪

16:21.774 --> 16:23.241
What's up, Sam?

16:23.275 --> 16:24.876
They're kind of waiting
for you down on set.

16:24.910 --> 16:27.812
Did you not like
the new pages or something?

16:27.847 --> 16:29.580
- Pages is good.
- Oh, that's great. Good.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.417
I aim to please.
That's awesome.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.286
I don't like being embarrassed, man.

16:35.321 --> 16:37.388
Embarrassed?
Really?

16:37.423 --> 16:39.958
Is this about--oh, is this
about the girl and the blow job?

16:39.992 --> 16:41.859
I mean, that's just one
of those crazy fucking things.

16:41.894 --> 16:43.594
She literally fell into my lap.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.963
You know,
I-I couldn't say no.

16:45.997 --> 16:48.399
Could have thought about me
and our friendship.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.434
Well, as she released my dick

16:50.468 --> 16:52.536
from the crowded confines
of my pantaloons,

16:52.570 --> 16:54.671
thoughts of you
were nowhere near my mind,

16:54.706 --> 16:56.506
which I think is probably
a good thing.

16:58.742 --> 17:01.277
Do you value our friendship, Moody?

17:01.311 --> 17:03.313
Yes, I've grown...

17:04.582 --> 17:07.218
quite fond of you, broheim.

17:07.252 --> 17:08.953
Same here, motherfucker.

17:08.988 --> 17:11.290
That's why I'm really going
to hate to do this to you.

17:11.324 --> 17:12.590
Come on, Sam.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.894
This is a bit
of a hip-hop cliche, isn't it?

17:14.929 --> 17:16.628
Cliches are cliches
for a reason, man--

17:16.664 --> 17:18.064
because they fucking work!

17:18.098 --> 17:21.768
You don't want to do this,
not over a silly blow job.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.605
You know what? I don't.
But what choice do I have, man?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.074
You disrespect me
in my fucking workplace?

17:27.108 --> 17:29.310
What are you talking about?
Do you even like this girl?

17:29.344 --> 17:30.611
I don't even know
that bitch's name, man.

17:30.646 --> 17:32.079
That ain't the point here.

17:32.113 --> 17:33.914
The point is, I'm number one
on that fucking call sheet!

17:33.948 --> 17:36.950
I can't have the whole cast and
crew of a major motion picture

17:36.984 --> 17:38.752
whispering how my court jester

17:38.786 --> 17:40.654
screwed the baddest bitch on the set!

17:40.688 --> 17:43.523
Is that all I am to you--
a court jester?

17:43.558 --> 17:45.526
Yeah, what, nigga?
You funny, man. You amuse me.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.128
You don't see the value in that?

17:47.162 --> 17:49.864
Yo, jestering is
a noble profession, Hank.

17:49.899 --> 17:52.868
Whatever.
You going to drop me or what?

17:52.902 --> 17:55.705
- You learned your lesson, man?
- Yes!

17:55.739 --> 17:57.473
Have you learned your fucking lesson?

17:58.909 --> 18:01.010
Do not accept free blow jobs
on the set from actresses

18:01.045 --> 18:03.513
if you're not number one
on the call sheet--got it.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.382

Well...

18:28.673 --> 18:31.909
I would very much...

18:31.944 --> 18:35.046
like to...

18:35.080 --> 18:36.347
suck your dick.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.850
What?
What did he say?

18:38.884 --> 18:42.587
I'm sorry.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.589
I would like...

18:44.624 --> 18:47.926
to suck your dick.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.161
What the fuck?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.431
And finger your asshole.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.033
Let me get this straight.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.769
You would like to suck my dick?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.905
And finger your asshole.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.773
And finger my asshole?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.076
Yes!

19:08.582 --> 19:09.782
Are you fucking with me?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.117
Yes! Yes!

19:12.152 --> 19:13.919
I'm sorry.
It was a dare.

19:13.954 --> 19:16.822
No disrespect intended,
none whatsoever.

19:19.926 --> 19:20.926
It was a dare!

19:20.960 --> 19:24.764
I swear!
It was a dare!

19:24.798 --> 19:26.632
Be gentle?

19:33.007 --> 19:35.974
- You okay?
- I suppose so.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.110
The heart palpitations are subsiding.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.412
I think I may need
to wipe myself, though.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.148
Look, man, I'm really sorry, yo.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.684
It ain't easy being the star
of this fucking joint, man.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.085
I'm under a lot of pressure.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.087
A lot of people looking up to me
for an example.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.622
I don't give a fuck about that bitch,

19:50.656 --> 19:52.257
but I do care about my credibility

19:52.291 --> 19:53.758
as a major movie star.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.459
I got to save face.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.495
I'm sorry if I did anything
to endanger your face.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.498
You know, Pete Berg dropped off
of this joint because of you

20:01.532 --> 20:03.199
and your fucking shenanigans.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.135
What did I do?
Nothing.

20:05.169 --> 20:07.405
Took it like a man,
because you my boy, Moody.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.908
I like being your boy.
Are we good?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.610
Yeah, we good, man.

20:13.814 --> 20:16.416
Your fucking ass would be
a fucking stain on Ocean Avenue

20:16.450 --> 20:18.084
- right now.
- Of course.

20:18.118 --> 20:20.721
That's another thing, man--
the Kali of it all.

20:20.755 --> 20:22.956
This bitch's got my heart
ping-ponging back and forth,

20:22.990 --> 20:24.157
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

20:24.191 --> 20:25.692
How much turmoil can a brother take?

20:25.726 --> 20:27.694
Copy that.
Yeah. Yeah.

20:35.436 --> 20:37.403
Where you want it at?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.571
What?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.673
- I got to hit you, man.
- Why?

20:40.707 --> 20:41.974
Fucking consequences, yo.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.576
Whoa, whoa, what about
dangling me over the balcony?

20:43.610 --> 20:44.744
That felt consequential to me.

20:44.778 --> 20:45.979
That was just to scare you, son.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.213
Yeah, well,
it did scare me--it did.

20:47.248 --> 20:48.782
Normally, I would
pistol-whip a motherfucker

20:48.816 --> 20:50.751
- for this kind of shit.
- No, no, no. That sounds--

20:50.785 --> 20:52.019
Yeah, that'd be too harsh, right?

20:52.053 --> 20:53.353
Yeah, that sounds too harsh.

20:53.388 --> 20:54.722
Stop fucking whining
and take your medicine, Moody.

20:55.858 --> 20:57.225
Ooh!

21:02.798 --> 21:04.798
Hey, you don't look too bad.

21:04.833 --> 21:08.435
I thought you'd walk back
in here all bruised up and shit.

21:08.470 --> 21:10.771
The only violence was emotional.

21:10.805 --> 21:13.440
What did they do?

21:13.474 --> 21:14.774
Ahh.

21:14.809 --> 21:18.778
Oh, they took me out back...

21:18.813 --> 21:21.449
put me down on my knees.

21:21.483 --> 21:25.286
The big gvy took down his pants.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.587
He took out his dick.

21:26.621 --> 21:29.791
It was very big, Tyler.

21:29.825 --> 21:31.559
He could have tied it into a pretzel.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.766
And?

21:39.502 --> 21:42.371
He slapped me in the face with it.

21:42.405 --> 21:44.139
He slapped you
in the face with his dick?

21:44.174 --> 21:46.241
Shh!

21:46.275 --> 21:49.077
Yes, multiple times.

21:49.111 --> 21:51.111
I think he left a trail of dogwater.

21:57.385 --> 21:59.586
Wow.

21:59.620 --> 22:03.089
Jesus, um...

22:03.123 --> 22:05.291
You know, I don't think
I can be represented by a guy

22:05.325 --> 22:08.027
who would allow himself
to be humiliated like that.

22:08.062 --> 22:09.262
What?

22:09.296 --> 22:11.130
I'm going to take
that meeting at I.C.M.

22:11.132 --> 22:13.966
- I'll let you know what I decide.
- Oh, no, you don't!

22:14.000 --> 22:15.101
You're signing with me,

22:15.135 --> 22:16.536
and you're signing with me right now!

22:16.570 --> 22:19.205
I just went through hell and
back for you, you little shit!

22:19.240 --> 22:21.074
You're going to sign with me,

22:21.108 --> 22:22.742
or I'm going to have my new friends

22:22.777 --> 22:24.745
slap you in the face
with all their dicks,

22:24.779 --> 22:27.080
you hear me?

22:28.483 --> 22:31.552
Yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.

22:35.357 --> 22:37.158
What's up, Stu?

22:50.605 --> 22:52.439
You have no idea what I went through

22:52.473 --> 22:54.907
for that two seconds of oral, lady.

22:54.942 --> 22:56.843
- Oh! Ow.
- Sorry.

22:56.845 --> 22:59.345
It's better if it looks
like you took advantage of me.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.913
Asshole!

23:00.947 --> 23:03.716
What the fuck?

23:05.753 --> 23:06.786
Hank...

23:06.821 --> 23:08.488
I say this with the utmost respect

23:08.523 --> 23:11.191
and fondness for you as both
an artist and a human being--

23:11.226 --> 23:12.192
You're fired.

23:12.227 --> 23:13.928
- What?
- You're gone.

23:13.962 --> 23:16.364
We're bringing in another writer
for the on-set work.

23:16.399 --> 23:17.632
Sam know about this?

23:17.667 --> 23:19.601
He knows it's the best thing.

23:19.636 --> 23:21.804
There's always the next one, buddy.

23:21.838 --> 23:23.572
I'll be in touch.

23:27.310 --> 23:28.744
What the fuck are you doing here?

23:28.778 --> 23:30.145
Charlie sent me to meet with Stu.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.681
- Charlie did?
- Yeah, I just signed with him.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.216
You just signed with Charlie?

23:34.250 --> 23:36.351
Yeah. Kind of a dream
come true, actually--

23:36.386 --> 23:38.153
to be repped by Hank Moody's agent.

23:38.188 --> 23:41.123
Pretty fucking cool...

23:41.157 --> 23:42.725
for me.

23:42.759 --> 23:44.660
Anyway, it looks like
it's already paying off.

23:44.694 --> 23:47.530
This might be my first gig.

23:47.565 --> 23:48.965
Have fun.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.634
This isn't going to be weird
for us, is it?

23:51.668 --> 23:54.270
No more than usual.

23:58.108 --> 24:01.043
- Sorry, Hank.
- Fuck you, Charlie.

24:01.078 --> 24:03.445
- You want to go get a drink?
- I have nothing to say to you.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.681
- You can hit me if you want.
- I don't want to hit you.

24:05.715 --> 24:07.683
I don't want to have anything
to do with you, all right?

24:07.717 --> 24:09.118
Come on, buddy, don't be that way.

24:09.152 --> 24:12.220
I am not your buddy,
and you're fucking fired...

24:12.255 --> 24:14.523
as an agent and a friend.

24:16.393 --> 24:19.160
♪ I'm standing here ♪

24:19.195 --> 24:21.663
♪ on the ground ♪

24:24.567 --> 24:26.201
On the house, pops.

24:26.235 --> 24:27.936
Really?
Right on.

24:27.971 --> 24:30.739
It helps to have daughters
in low places.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.742
That's for changing
my boyfriend's life.

24:35.879 --> 24:38.782
He just texted me and said
you helped him get a job.

24:38.816 --> 24:41.518
Huh.
Well, I guess I did.

24:41.552 --> 24:43.553
Thank you, dad.

24:43.588 --> 24:44.721
I love you.

24:44.756 --> 24:47.057
Oh, now you love me.

24:47.091 --> 24:48.758
I always love you...

24:48.793 --> 24:51.995
even when I'm thoroughly
disgusted with you.

24:52.029 --> 24:53.963
You really like this guy, huh?

24:53.998 --> 24:55.131
I do.

24:55.165 --> 24:57.366
Not to be melodramatic or anything,

24:57.401 --> 25:00.202
but he's the first real love
of my life.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.904
It is what it is.

25:01.938 --> 25:03.906
Well, the good news is

25:03.941 --> 25:07.376
I think he feels exactly
the same way about you.

25:07.411 --> 25:09.912
How could he not?
You are pretty stellar.

25:09.947 --> 25:11.414
So what's the bad news?

25:11.448 --> 25:13.750
There is none.

25:13.784 --> 25:15.452
Just be careful.

25:15.486 --> 25:16.620
Young writers on the rise

25:16.654 --> 25:19.255
have been known
to make certain mistakes.

25:19.289 --> 25:20.656
Such as?

25:20.691 --> 25:23.292
Such as sticking their dicks

25:23.327 --> 25:25.395
in places where kind words
and flattery come from.

25:25.429 --> 25:27.196
- That's disgusting, dad.
- It is.

25:27.231 --> 25:28.230
I'm sorry.
I apologize.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.598
It's just you're getting older,

25:29.633 --> 25:32.301
and the advice-giving gets more
and more confusing for me.

25:32.335 --> 25:37.739
Oh, if it isn't my favorite
friend of a friend of Bill W.

25:37.773 --> 25:40.608
- That's not funny.
- It's a little funny, mom.

25:40.642 --> 25:43.544
You see? The little barista
says it's funny.

25:43.579 --> 25:44.779
It must be so.

25:44.813 --> 25:46.147
She's pleased with me today,

25:46.182 --> 25:48.383
seeing as I changed
her boyfriend's life and all.

25:48.418 --> 25:52.288
I know. That was
incredibly sweet of you.

25:52.322 --> 25:54.390
Jeez.

25:54.424 --> 25:55.925
If I'd known it was this easy

25:55.959 --> 25:57.460
to get back in your good graces,

25:57.494 --> 26:00.129
I would have blown Tyler
a long time ago,

26:00.164 --> 26:02.399
and we could have lived
happily ever after.

26:02.433 --> 26:04.167
Should we...?

26:04.201 --> 26:06.803
- What...
- Up to you.

26:06.837 --> 26:08.338
Are you two lovelies up to?

26:08.372 --> 26:10.140
I'm off in a few minutes.

26:10.174 --> 26:12.742
We were going to go to the movies.

26:12.777 --> 26:14.144
You want to come?

26:14.178 --> 26:16.545
Ah, to tell you the truth,
I'm not really enamored

26:16.580 --> 26:18.981
of the fucking
moving pictures right now.

26:22.285 --> 26:25.020
But of course.

26:25.055 --> 26:27.256
By all means, let's...

26:27.291 --> 26:29.258
let's go to the movies.
